The editorial board of the Albanian newspaper "The People's Voice" published an article titled "Soviet Revisionism and Czechoslovakia" on July 24. The article exposes the infighting between the Soviet revisionist traitors and the Czechoslovak revisionist traitors, the disintegration of the revisionist clique, and strongly condemns the Soviet revisionist leadership and its followers for fully restoring capitalism at home and capitulating to U.S. imperialism abroad. The article calls on the Soviet people and the people of other countries under the rule of revisionist cliques to rise up and fight to overthrow the reactionary rule of revisionism.

The article points out that the Czechoslovak people are experiencing difficult times, facing threats from both domestic and foreign sources. This is the result of the betrayal by the Czechoslovak revisionists and the domestic reactionary forces, as well as the collusion between revisionism and imperialism.

Many enemies are tightly gripping the Czechoslovak people, seeking to enslave them forever. They all claim to be "loyal friends" of the Czechoslovak people, saying they want to "give the Czechoslovak people the freedom and democracy they are losing," but they are actually preparing graves for the Czechoslovak people. The Novotny clique tied the fate of Czechoslovakia to the Khrushchev faction. Novotny was Khrushchev's favorite. After Khrushchev's downfall, Novotny and his associates followed Brezhnev-Kosygin, acting as their enthusiastic defenders and first-rate anti-Marxist henchmen.

The article states that the Dubcek clique overthrew Novotny, who had the most secure position among the revisionist countries, along with his associates. Dubcek, who was not well-known and had no authority until recently, is surrounded by revisionists and extreme elements released from prison. Surprisingly, the Novotny clique did not resist at all; instead, they themselves hastened their own destruction, submitted their resignations, and fled like defeated scoundrels, as if someone was directing them from behind the scenes.

All of this indicates that the Czechoslovak issue is not as simple as it seems. There is a conspiracy against the people of this country and against this country, which holds an important strategic position in Europe. Therefore, Czechoslovakia is the chessboard, and the factions that have been overthrown, the factions that have come to power, and the factions that will come to power are pawns in the hands of the Soviet revisionists and American imperialists. International dark forces are freely operating in Czechoslovakia.

The article states that modern revisionists in various countries are trying to completely break away from Soviet revisionism and form new alliances and bridges with U.S. imperialism and world capitalism. In this regard, Soviet revisionism itself provides the most concrete, realistic, and largest example, eagerly pursuing endless alliances with the United States and world capitalism. This alliance rules the capitalist-revisionist world today. These two major capitalist countries are attempting to dominate the world and divide spheres of influence, placing anti-Marxism-Leninism, anti-socialism, and anti-revolutionary activities at the forefront. In their struggle for spheres of influence, they also seek to subjugate vassal states. Of course, this will also lead to vassal states breaking away from one great power and relying on another. In this way, a struggle between wolves ensues, and many countries' people, including the Czechoslovak people, are sacrificed.

Czechoslovakia, a revisionist satellite of the Soviet revisionists, is now trying to break free from the constraints of the Khrushchevs and form an alliance with the Americans and Western capitalism. The Czechoslovak reactionaries and revisionists are receiving assistance from world capitalism in their efforts.

The article points out that the Soviet revisionist leadership, along with the revisionist cliques of Poland, the German Democratic Republic, Bulgaria, and Hungary, are blackmailing and continuously pressuring the Dubcek clique to submit to them and not break away from their circle, etc. They accuse the Dubcek revisionist clique of the very things they themselves had previously done on a large scale. In other words, they are telling the Dubcek clique: "You absolutely cannot collude with the Americans, but we can. You absolutely cannot maintain diplomatic relations with the Federal Republic of Germany, but we can. You absolutely cannot obtain loans from capitalists, but we can." The threats from the Soviet Union are so blatant that under the pretext of the Warsaw Pact and so-called "military exercises," they sent their troops to Czechoslovakia to intervene.

It is no surprise that the Soviet and Czechoslovak revisionists have reached this point, because we know and have said that robbers always divide their spoils with robbers' methods.

When discussing the power struggle between the Dubcek clique and the Novotny clique, the article points out that the Soviet revisionists not only fully knew about the situation in Czechoslovakia but were also the instigators, conspirators, and organizers.

The Czechoslovak Dubcek revisionist clique seems to have received good assurances from the Soviet revisionist leadership to achieve its success. This clique used the same tactics as Khrushchev in the past to expose the revisionist Novotny, calling him a "Stalinist," beginning to criticize Gottwald, reviving the ghost of Slansky, restoring the reputation of traitors, attacking 1948, and criticizing Stalin's interference in the Czechoslovak trials, etc.

The article points out that later, the Soviet revisionists saw that the Dubcek clique had violated what they had jointly agreed upon. After the Dubcek clique suppressed the Novotny clique, it gave freedom to the domestic reactionaries to obtain the support of foreign reactionaries, who had already begun to strongly support the liberalization movement in Czechoslovakia, although they had not burned their hands as openly as during the Hungarian counter-revolutionary events.

The article states that the Soviet revisionists, seeing the bird fly away from their hands and losing control over Czechoslovakia, resorted to their "high-pressure tactics," blackmailing and threatening the Dubcek clique to account for itself. However, the Dubcek clique did not back down.

The article points out that the Soviet leadership recently, in the Polish capital of Warsaw, orchestrated a ridiculous meeting attended by the revisionist leaders of Poland, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, and Bulgaria. In a letter, they demanded that Dubcek and his associates not exceed the scope of internal and foreign policies that Moscow would allow for Czechoslovakia.

The signatories of this Warsaw letter are hypocritical and cunning. These traitors, who have betrayed Marxism-Leninism and their own people, accuse the Czechoslovak traitors of betraying Marxism-Leninism and Czechoslovakia. However, the aforementioned letter clearly reveals the conspiracy against the Czechoslovak people by the Soviet revisionists, the Dubcek clique, and the world counter-revolution. The letter admits: the Soviet revisionists agreed to the Dubcek clique's removal of the Novotny clique. The letter implies that the Dubcek clique did not fulfill the promises made in the dirty dealings behind the scenes. Therefore, after the Novotny clique was liquidated, the "train did not run on the predetermined track."

They demand that the Dubcek clique follow the Moscow path as decided behind the scenes. In other words, to establish capitalism in Czechoslovakia, but not to make a big fuss, to maintain false and deceptive forms; not to let the Czechoslovak reactionaries make too much noise. Therefore, the Soviet revisionists are advising the Czechoslovak revisionists to "pull chestnuts out of the fire, but not to burn their hands."

Who are the signatories of the Warsaw letter? One is Brezhnev, one is Kosygin, one is Podgorny, three great traitors. They themselves form a close alliance with U.S. imperialism but accuse the Czechoslovak revisionists of allying with the Americans; they themselves cause the party to degenerate but advise Dubcek to follow the "party charter and principles"; they establish capitalism in their own country but want Dubcek to act according to their wishes; they themselves maintain relations with Bonn and make large transactions but tell Dubcek not to maintain relations with the Federal Republic of Germany.

The Soviet revisionists' hysterical outcry against Czechoslovakia is to show their enthusiasm and cover up the conspiracy. However, they are so enthusiastic that the letter itself also admits that the Warsaw Treaty, originally signed for other purposes, has become a means of attacking treaty participants who do not obey the Soviet revisionists in the hands of the Soviet revisionist gang.

Recently, the infamous Wladyslaw Gomulka, who went to Moscow and then to Prague, proposed holding a meeting of European revisionist parties to judge the Soviet-Czechoslovak dispute. This proposal by the leader of the French revisionists was supported by the Kremlin chiefs. However, when they saw that most European revisionist parties expressed support for Dubcek, they quickly notified their followers to withdraw the proposal, because holding a meeting under these circumstances would mean the failure of the Moscow meeting scheduled for November.

Similarly, Tito himself took the stage. It is said that he may also go to Prague. The prospects are "beautiful." We will see new conflicts.

The article points out that the crisis within the revisionist camp is deepening. This is a good thing for the revolutionary forces of these countries and the world.

The article points out that the entire plot of the Soviet revisionists was initially to remove the Novotny clique and bring the Dubcek clique to power; the second stage was to use various blackmail and threats and the infamous Warsaw letter to try to overthrow the Dubcek clique; the third stage is the complete failure of the Soviet revisionists, first arrogant and then humble, the result of which will be the issuance of a grand statement saying that "the peak of sincere and eternal friendship between the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia has been reached."

The article states that the Soviet people and the people of other countries under the rule of revisionism cannot but see where the revisionist betrayal line is leading the Soviet Union and other revisionist countries. The events in Czechoslovakia help them realize that the center of betrayal of Marxism-Leninism, the center of betrayal of revolution and socialism, is Moscow, and the leadership of this center is the Brezhnev-Kosygin-Podgorny clique and other revisionist leaders. If this center is not eliminated, the danger to the October Revolution and the Soviet state cannot be eliminated. The betrayal of Gomulka, Dubcek, and the like is only a part of this thorough betrayal. Therefore, to effectively fight against the ruling cliques of various revisionist countries, it is necessary to direct the struggle not only against the domestic revisionists but also against the international center of modern revisionism, the Soviet revisionists.

The article continues that the situation for the Czechoslovak people is serious but not hopeless. As long as they believe in their own strength and the strength of international healthy Marxism-Leninism, they will open the way to salvation. The revolutionary Marxist-Leninists of Czechoslovakia must establish a new, truly Marxist-Leninist Czechoslovak Communist Party, declare war on the Dubcek revisionist party and all bourgeois parties in Czechoslovakia, and strive to mobilize the Czechoslovak working class and people to fight, participate in armed revolution, against domestic revisionists of all kinds, against the Czechoslovak bourgeois reactionaries and bourgeois parties, against the Soviet, Tito, Polish, German, Hungarian, etc., revisionists, against U.S. imperialism and all bourgeois and capitalist forces in the world.

This is a great and arduous but entirely achievable task. The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people, the Party of Labor of Albania and the Albanian people, have set a brilliant example, defeating countless enemies on all fronts. This is the road to freedom, the road of Marxism-Leninism. The hardworking Czechoslovak people and the true Marxist-Leninists of Czechoslovakia must also take this road.

A nation, even for a short period, relaxes its revolutionary vigilance, weakens or loses its will to defend independence and rights, will face many disasters brought by domestic and foreign enemies. We live and fight in such an era, the people of all countries cannot relax their vigilance, they cannot be deceived by the sweet-talking words of a small group of traitors who are forging heavy chains for them. The people must know their own strength and role and must not let this strength be used by a group of swindlers, turncoats, and traitors hired by the domestic bourgeoisie and foreign capital. The people who have lost their freedom and rights, won through blood and sacrifice, must know that only among them exists the great power of self-salvation, and they must quickly organize this power in a fighting manner and, without losing the opportunity, deal a fatal blow to the domestic enemies and their allies abroad.

Recognizing one's own strength means recognizing one's own strength and the enemy's strength, means organizing one's own strength, and conducting an uncompromising, merciless struggle against the enemy's strength until complete victory.

Having confidence in one's own strength means being ruthless towards the enemy, not trusting or hoping for the enemy in the slightest, not believing in his tricks, and not being lenient towards the enemy even in victory. The snake's head must be chopped off.

The article states that the Czechoslovak crisis is not an accidental, unexpected phenomenon, nor is it an isolated crisis. It is part of the deep crisis of modern revisionism, and the center of the crisis is in the Soviet Union. Around the Soviet Union, in the vassal states trying to break free from the Soviet revisionist yoke, this crisis can also be felt.

The Soviet revisionists are experiencing a serious crisis and are paying a heavy price for it. The great betrayal of the Khrushchev faction is the root of the evil, and it must be uprooted with blood and revolution.

The betrayal of the socialist camp began with Tito, Khrushchev strengthened this betrayal, and the Brezhnev-Kosygin clique and all modern revisionist traitors are pushing this betrayal to its peak. These modern revisionist traitors, some following the Brezhnev-Kosygin clique, some unrestrained, act very freely.

The traitors of Marxism-Leninism, like mad wolves, desperately try to suppress the voice of the Party of Labor of Albania, which mercilessly exposes their betrayal. The Party of Labor of Albania bravely withstands the storm, smashes the ideological enemies, exposes them, foresees what is happening now, and, based on Marxism-Leninism, foresees that the crisis of revisionism will develop and that there will be a second proletarian revolution in the Soviet Union.

The article points out that the Soviet revisionists must pay their debts to the proletariat of the Soviet Union and the world. This account must be settled, and they must pay their blood debt.

We have not forgotten this, nor have the Soviet people forgotten it, nor have all Marxist-Leninists around the world forgotten it. The Soviet revisionists continue to perform their betrayal acts, and their main accomplices are U.S. imperialism. The U.S. and the Soviet revisionists are the worst and most dangerous enemies in the world. The U.S. and the Soviet revisionists kiss and hug tightly. The Soviet revisionists are shamelessly shouting that the Dubcek clique is putting socialism in danger, saying it is uniting with capitalists; while the Soviet revisionists themselves, in collusion with U.S. imperialism, place the Soviet Union and the satellite countries they still control in a subordinate position and conspire with the U.S. to try to dominate the world.

But no matter what you do, you will expose yourselves, because everything you do is bluffing, unprincipled, and you are trapped in domestic and foreign contradictions. Every step you take downwards is a step towards the abyss that will crush you to pieces. The act of betrayal has choked your neck and tied your hands and feet, making you unable to escape. No one likes traitors. Your fate is to be hanged and shot. You are still boasting now, thinking you are strong because you have the armed forces of a great power. But you have miscalculated. You are the most cowardly, and you can only use your weapons to frighten the neurotic. You clearly know that in the face of the people's power, the proletarian power, and the Bolshevik power, your strength and your boasting have how much value. The power of the people, the proletariat, and the Bolsheviks will, on a day not far away, eliminate you from the face of the earth.

　　苏联修正主义和捷克斯洛伐克
　　——阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》编辑部文章（摘要）
    新华社地拉那九日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》七月二十四日发表了一篇题为《苏联修正主义和捷克斯洛伐克》的文章，揭露苏修叛徒同捷修叛徒狗咬狗的斗争和修正主义集团的分崩离析，强烈谴责苏修领导集团及其追随者在国内全面复辟资本主义、在国际上投降美帝国主义的滔天罪行，号召苏联人民和其他修正主义集团统治下的各国人民奋起斗争，推翻修正主义的反动统治。
    文章指出，捷克斯洛伐克人民经历着困难的时刻，他们受到来自国内外的威胁。这是赫鲁晓夫修正主义者、捷克斯洛伐克修正主义者和国内反动势力叛卖的结果，是修正主义和帝国主义勾结的结果。
    许多敌人牢牢地不放过捷克斯洛伐克人民，要永远奴役他们。他们全都标榜自己是捷克斯洛伐克人民的“忠实的朋友”，他们都说要“给捷克斯洛伐克人民以他们正在失去的自由民主”，但他们都是给捷克斯洛伐克人民准备坟墓。诺沃提尼集团把捷克斯洛伐克的命运同赫鲁晓夫分子连结在一起。诺沃提尼是赫鲁晓夫所器重的宠儿。赫鲁晓夫下台后，诺沃提尼及其同党紧跟勃列日涅夫—柯西金，充当他们的热心的辩护士和反马克思主义的头等打手。
    文章说，杜布切克集团把看来在修正主义国家中地位最牢固的诺沃提尼及其同伙赶下了台。杜布切克这个人不久之前还不出名，而且没有任何权威，他周围的人都是修正主义分子和从监狱中释放出来的极端分子。令人惊奇的是，诺沃提尼集团的人丝毫没有进行抵抗，他们反而自己促使自己走向毁灭，提出辞呈，并象败家子那样溜掉了，好象有人从后台指挥他们这样做。
    所有这一切说明，捷克斯洛伐克问题事实上不会是这么简单。这里，有一个反对这个国家的人民、反对这个在欧洲占有重要战略地位的国家的阴谋。所以，捷克斯洛伐克就是棋盘，已经下台的集团，已经上台的集团和将要上台的集团是苏联修正主义者和美帝国主义手中的走卒。国际的黑手正任意地在捷克斯洛伐克活动。
    文章说，各国的现代修正主义者正在竭力设法完全摆脱苏联修正主义，并同美帝国主义和世界资本主义结成新的联系、联盟和搭桥。在这个方面，苏联修正主义本身提供了最具体的、最现实的、最大的榜样，它不顾一切地热衷于同美国和世界资本主义结成无止境的联盟。这个联盟今天统治着资本主义—修正主义世界。这两个大的资本主义国家力图主宰世界并瓜分势力范围，把反对马克思列宁主义、反对社会主义、反对革命的勾当摆在首位。它们在这场争夺势力范围的斗争中，也要使仆从国屈服于它们的统治。当然，这也会造成仆从国脱离这个大国而依赖另一个大国的情况。这样一来，就发生一场豺狼之间的斗争，就出现阴谋诡计，而牺牲许多国家的人民的利益，包括捷克斯洛伐克人民在内。
    捷克斯洛伐克——苏联修正主义者的一个修正主义的卫星国——现在正竭力想摆脱赫鲁晓夫们的束缚，并同美国人及西方资本主义结成联盟。捷克斯洛伐克反动派和修正主义者在进行这些努力时得到了世界资本主义的援助。
    文章指出，苏修领导集团纠集波兰、德意志民主共和国、保加利亚和匈牙利的修正主义集团，对杜布切克集团进行讹诈并不断施加压力，使其向他们屈服，使其不要脱离他们的圈子，等等。他们指责杜布切克修正主义集团的那些东西正是他们自己先前大规模搞的那些东西。换句话说，他们无异于对杜布切克集团说：“你们绝不能同美国勾勾搭搭，而我们是可以的。你们绝不能同德意志联邦共和国保持外交关系，而我们是可以的。你们绝不能得到资本家的信贷，而我们是可以的。”苏联的威胁如此之露骨，以致在华沙条约和所谓“军队演习”的幌子下把他们的军队开到捷克斯洛伐克去进行干涉。
    苏联和捷克斯洛伐克修正主义者搞到如此地步，我们是毫不奇怪的，因为我们知道而且说过，强盗总是用强盗的办法进行分赃的。
    文章在谈到杜布切克集团同诺沃提尼集团争权夺利的丑剧时指出，苏联修正主义者不仅完全知道捷克斯洛伐克正发生的事态，而且他们是煽动者、阴谋者和组织者。
    捷克斯洛伐克的杜布切克修正主义集团看来从苏修领导方面得到了达到它的成功的良好保证。这个集团在它的做法上采用了过去赫鲁晓夫一套手法来揭露修正主义分子诺沃提尼，他们称他为“斯大林主义者”，他们开始指责哥特瓦尔德，使斯兰斯基的幽灵复活了，他们开始恢复叛国分子的名誉，开始攻击一九四八年，指责斯大林干涉捷克斯洛伐克的审讯案等等。
    文章指出，但是后来苏联修正主义者看到，杜布切克集团违背了他们曾共同商定的东西。杜布切克集团镇压了诺沃提尼集团以后给了国内反动派以自由，以便得到国外反动派的支持，国外反动派已开始强有力地支持捷克斯洛伐克的自由化运动，只是没有象在匈牙利反革命事件时期那样公开烧着自己的手。
    文章说，苏联修正主义者眼看鸟儿从他们手中逃走，失去了对捷克斯洛伐克的控制，便采取了他们的“高压手段”，进行讹诈、威胁，要杜布切克集团作出交代。而杜布切克集团并不回头。
    文章指出，苏联领导集团最近在波兰首都华沙策划召开有波兰、德意志民主共和国、匈牙利和保加利亚的修正主义领导人参加的荒谬的会议上通过了一封信。他们在信中要求杜布切克及其同伙不要超越莫斯科将允许捷克斯洛伐克的内政和外交政策的范围。
    这封华沙信件的虚伪而诡诈的签署者贼喊捉贼。这些背叛马克思列宁主义、背叛本国人民的叛徒却指责捷克斯洛伐克的叛徒背叛了马克思列宁主义和捷克斯洛伐克。但是上述信件清楚地表明苏联修正主义者、杜布切克集团和世界反革命策划的这个反对捷克斯洛伐克人民的阴谋。这封信承认：苏修曾同意杜布切克集团清除诺沃提尼集团。信中暗示，杜布切克集团没有履行在幕后进行的肮脏交易中所许下的诺言。因此在清算了诺沃提尼之后，“火车就不按预定的轨道走了”。
    他们要求杜布切克集团，象幕后所决定的那样，走莫斯科的道路。一句话，要在捷克斯洛伐克建立资本主义，但是不要大肆声张，要保持虚假的骗人的形式；不让捷克斯洛伐克的反动派喧闹得太厉害。因此，苏联修正主义者是劝捷克斯洛伐克修正主义者“火中取栗，但不要烧伤自己的手。”
    在华沙信件上署名的是些什么人呢？一个叫勃列日涅夫，一个叫柯西金，一个叫波德戈尔内，三个大叛徒。他们自己同美帝结成紧密的联盟，却指责捷修同美国人结盟；他们自己使党蜕化变质，却劝告杜布切克执行“党章和准则”；他们在自己国家里建立起资本主义，却要杜布切克按照他们的意愿办事；他们自己同波恩保持关系，作了大宗交易，却叫杜布切克不要同德意志联邦共和国保持关系。
    苏修捶胸顿足对捷克斯洛伐克发出歇斯底里的叫嚣，是要表示自己是热心的，是要掩饰阴谋。但是，他们热心到这种地步，以致这封信本身也承认，原来为其他的一些目的签订的华沙条约，在苏修匪帮手中，已经变成了对不听命于苏修的条约参加者进行攻击的一种手段。
    最近前往莫斯科、然后去布拉格的臭名远扬的瓦德克·罗歇，要求举行欧洲修正主义党会议来判断苏捷争端。法修头目的这个建议得到克里姆林宫首脑的赞同。但是，当他们看到大多数欧洲的修正主义党表示支持杜布切克的时候，他们就赶紧通知自己的仆从，要他撤销他的建议，因为在这种情况下举行会议就事先意味着据说要在十一月举行的莫斯科会议的失败。
    同样，铁托也亲自登台表演。据说他可能还要去布拉格。前景“美妙”。我们将看到新的冲突。
    文章指出，修正主义阵营内部危机正在加深。这对这些国家和全世界的革命力量，是一件好事。
    文章指出，苏修的这一整套阴谋，最初是为了搞掉诺沃提尼集团，让杜布切克集团上台；第二阶段是使尽种种讹诈、威胁手段并用臭名昭著的华沙信件，想推翻杜布切克集团；第三阶段是苏修完全遭到失败，先倨后恭，其结果必将是发表一项冠冕堂皇的公报，说什么已经达到了“苏联和捷克斯洛伐克之间的真诚和永恒友谊的顶峰”。
    文章说，苏联人民，修正主义者统治下的各国人民，不能不看到修正主义的背叛路线在把苏联及其他修正主义国家引向什么地方去。捷克斯洛伐克发生的事件，帮助他们认识到，背叛马克思列宁主义的中心，背叛革命和社会主义的中心是莫斯科，这个中心的领导是勃列日涅夫—柯西金—波德戈尔内集团和其他修正主义头目，如果不消灭这个中心，威胁十月革命和苏维埃国家的危险就无法消除。哥穆尔卡、杜布切克之流的叛卖行径，只不过是这一彻头彻尾的叛卖行径的组成部分而已。因此，要同各个修正主义国家的统治集团进行有成效的斗争，就得把斗争的矛头不仅指向本国的修正主义者，同时要把斗争矛头指向现代修正主义的国际中心苏修。
    文章接着说，对捷克斯洛伐克人民来说，形势是严重的，但不是绝望的。只要相信自己的力量，相信国际上的健康的马克思列宁主义的力量，就会为他们开辟得救的道路。捷克斯洛伐克的革命的马克思列宁主义者，必须建立一个新的真正的马克思列宁主义的捷克斯洛伐克共产党，毫不留情地对杜布切克的修正主义党，对捷克斯洛伐克的一切资产阶级政党宣战，努力鼓动捷克斯洛伐克工人阶级和人民投入战斗，参加武装革命，反对国内形形色色的修正主义者，反对捷克斯洛伐克的资产阶级反动派和资产阶级政党，反对苏联的、铁托的、波兰的、德国的、匈牙利等的修正主义者，反对美帝国主义和世界上的一切资产阶级和资本主义。
    这是一个伟大、繁重、但是完全可能实现的任务。中国共产党和中国人民，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民树立了光辉的榜样，他们正在各条战线上战胜无数敌人。这条道路是自由的道路，是马克思列宁主义的道路，勤劳的捷克斯洛伐克人民和捷克斯洛伐克真正的马克思列宁主义者也必须走这一条道路。
    一个民族在一个时期，即使是很短的时期，放松了革命的警惕性，减弱或丧失了捍卫独立和权利的斗志，就会面临国内外敌人给他们带来的许多灾祸。我们生活和战斗在这样的时代，各国人民不能放松警惕，他们不能受正在给他们铸造沉重锁链的一小撮叛徒的笼络人心的鬼话的欺骗。人民必须知道自己的力量和作用，决不能让这种力量被本国资产阶级和外国资本雇用的一批骗子、变节分子和叛徒所利用。由于放松警惕从而丧失了流血牺牲得来的自由和权利的人民不仅必须知道，在他们中间，只有在他们中间，才存在着自救的巨大力量，而且还必须尽快以战斗的方式把这种力量组织起来，不失时机地给予国内敌人及其在国外的同盟者以致命的打击。
    认识自己的力量就意味着认清自己的力量和敌人的力量，意味着把自己的力量组织起来，对敌人的力量进行无情的、不妥协的斗争，直到彻底胜利。
    对自己的力量有信心，意味着对敌人要狠，对敌人不能抱有丝毫的信任和希望，不能相信他的阴谋诡计，就是在胜利的时候也不能对敌人宽大。蛇头是永远要砍掉的。
    文章说，捷克斯洛伐克危机不是一种偶然的、出乎意料的现象，也不是一个孤立的危机。它是现代修正主义的深刻的危机的一部分，而危机的中心是在苏联。在苏联的周围，在设法摆脱苏修的枷锁的仆从国里，也可觉察到这一危机。
    苏修正在经历着某种严重的危机，它正在为此付出惨重的代价。赫鲁晓夫分子的大叛卖是祸根，必须不惜流血牺牲和进行革命来拔除这个祸根。
    对社会主义阵营的叛卖始于铁托，赫鲁晓夫加强了这种叛卖，勃列日涅夫—柯西金集团和一切现代修正主义叛徒正在使这种叛卖达到登峰造极的地步。这些现代修正主义叛徒，有的跟着勃列日涅夫—柯西金集团走，有的不受约束，行动十分自由。
    马克思列宁主义的叛徒们象疯狂的豺狼一样，拚命企图压倒无情地揭露他们的叛卖行径的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的声音。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党英勇地顶着暴风雨，粉碎了意识形态方面的敌人，揭露他们，预料到现在所发生的事，并且根据马克思列宁主义，预见到修正主义危机将会发展和苏联将会发生第二次无产阶级革命。
    文章指出，苏联修正主义者必须向苏联和世界的无产阶级还债。这笔账是一定要算的，他们必须偿还血债。
    这一点，我们并没有忘记，苏联人民也没有忘记，全世界的马克思列宁主义者也都没有忘记。苏联修正主义者在继续表演背叛的勾当，他们的主要同伙是美帝国主义。美帝、苏修是世界上最坏最危险的敌人。美帝、苏修互相接吻和紧紧拥抱。苏联修正主义者在最无耻地叫嚷，说杜布切克集团使社会主义处于危险之中，说它同资本家联合；而苏修自己却伙同美帝国主义，把苏联和他们还控制着的卫星国置于受支配的地位，并同美帝勾结在一起，企图主宰全世界。
    但是，不论你们干什么，都将是你们暴露自己，因为你们干的一切都是虚张声势，都是无原则的，你们陷入了国内外的重重矛盾之中，你们滑下去的每一步，都是走向将使你们粉身碎骨的深渊的一步。背叛行径已卡住了你们的脖子，捆住了你们的手脚，使你们无法解脱。谁都不喜欢叛徒。你们的命运是受绞刑和被枪毙。你们现在还在大吹大擂，你们自以为强大，因为你们有一个大国的武装力量。但是，你们打错了算盘。你们是最胆怯的，你们只能用你们的武器去吓唬神经衰弱的人们。你们清楚地知道，在各国人民力量面前，在无产阶级力量面前和布尔什维克力量面前，你们的力量和你们的自吹自擂有多少价值，各国人民、无产阶级和布尔什维克的力量在不会遥远的一天，将把你们从地球上消灭掉。
