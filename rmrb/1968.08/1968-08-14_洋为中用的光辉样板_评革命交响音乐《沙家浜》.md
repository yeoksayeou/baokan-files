Three years ago, under the personal guidance of our beloved Comrade Jiang Qing, the brand-new revolutionary symphony "Sha Jianhu" was born! This is the first truly proletarian and people's symphony in the world. It vividly portrays the lofty heroic image of the proletariat, passionately praises Chairman Mao's great thoughts on people's war, and triumphantly plays the victory song of "power comes from the barrel of a gun."

The majestic orchestral music, accompanied by thunderous drums, opens the curtain of the symphony "Sha Jianhu." On the red stage backdrop, eight golden characters appear: "Long Live the Victory of People's War." What a great thought, what a clear theme!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." Whether to insist on revolutionary armed struggle or to belittle and even abolish revolutionary armed struggle, this is a fundamental difference between Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev.

In the process of adapting the opera "Reed Marsh Fire Seed" into the opera "Sha Jianhu," our great leader Chairman Mao wisely instructed: to highlight armed struggle, embody the thoughts of people's war, and strengthen the image of positive heroic figures. However, the henchmen of the Chinese Khrushchev, such as Peng Zhen and Zhou Yang, openly resisted and shouted that the "gunpowder smell was too strong," attempting to turn "Reed Marsh Fire Seed" into something like "Underground Contact." Comrade Jiang Qing led revolutionary cultural warriors in a courageous struggle, smashing the evil schemes of these reactionary elements. The opera "Sha Jianhu" finally highlighted armed struggle and vividly presented the great truth of "power comes from the barrel of a gun."

The symphony "Sha Jianhu," based on the opera "Sha Jianhu," added the characteristics of symphonic music. In its added overture and finale chorus, the military and people sing, "Wielding swords and holding rifles, the whole nation is armed," "Dare to struggle, dare to win, firmly grasp the gun," vividly revealing the theme of the entire work. The use of the New Fourth Army's military song, the chorus in the scene "Eighteen Green Pines" and "Raid on Sha Jianhu," and the description of the battle scene music powerfully portray the heroic image of the New Fourth Army soldiers with red hearts and brave fighting spirits. In the segments that concentrate on portraying the sublime spiritual world of the New Fourth Army political commissar Guo Jian'guang, due to the accompaniment of the symphony orchestra, the chorus's support, and especially the interweaving of the military song and the musical theme of "Eighteen Green Pines," Guo Jian'guang and the collective image of the soldiers are combined, making them even more towering, moving, and representative. The portrayal of these heroic figures helps to express the theme of the work and powerfully embodies Chairman Mao's brilliant instruction to highlight armed struggle.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Revolutionary war is a war of the masses; it can only be waged by mobilizing the masses and can only be waged by relying on the masses." In the symphony "Sha Jianhu," in the scene "Fish and Water Affection," Grandma Sha and Guo Jian'guang's intimate and sincere duet, as well as the soldiers' lively and enthusiastic accompaniment, depict the revolutionary affection of the military loving the people and the people supporting the military, the military and people being as close as one family, so vividly! After the Japanese invaders and traitors occupied Sha Jianhu, Guo Jian'guang and the soldiers in the reed marshes thought, "The villagers and fellow countrymen will suffer," "Class hatred and national hatred burn in our hearts"; while Ah Qing and the villagers in the village thought, "Our relatives are short of food and medicine, and news is cut off," "Eighteen people are all connected to me like flesh and blood." Here, the opera is two arias, and in the symphony, a chorus is added, further expressing the deep class feelings of the people and the soldiers. To cover and support the soldiers, the underground contact Ah Qing bravely and calmly fights against the traitors Hu Chuanhui and Xiao Deyi; to cover and support the soldiers, Grandma Sha fears no violence, regards death as return, and pours out her anger to denounce the traitors and sellouts! The towering heroic images of Ah Qing and Grandma Sha represent the "millions and millions of people who truly support the revolution." The symphony "Sha Jianhu" embodies this truth with moving artistic power: "The military and people united as one, who in the world can be our enemy?"

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We not only deny abstract, absolute, and unchanging political standards, but also deny abstract, absolute, and unchanging artistic standards." The great revolution in the political content of symphonic music must necessarily lead to a great revolution in artistic form. A major problem faced in the creation of the symphony "Sha Jianhu" is: dare we break free from the frameworks imposed by Western bourgeoisie on symphonic music? Can we boldly create new artistic forms to express revolutionary political content as perfectly as possible? Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line and Comrade Jiang Qing's patient instruction, the revolutionary cultural warriors of the Central Orchestra resolutely take their own path, break free from the bourgeois symphonic frameworks, liberate symphonic music, and create a new form of proletarian symphonic music.

The symphony "Sha Jianhu" successfully utilizes the strengths of the symphony orchestra. The symphony orchestra itself is a good weapon, especially with a complete set of brass instruments, making the entire orchestra's performance grand and powerful. The symphony orchestra's performance techniques also have many advantages, being good at describing battle scenes, depicting natural environments, and enhancing passionate emotions. The symphony "Sha Jianhu" creatively uses the melody of the New Fourth Army's military song, not only as an important part of the overture and finale but also interweaving it throughout various segments with a thematic development method, greatly strengthening the heroic image of the New Fourth Army. In the segment "Raid on Sha Jianhu," the melody of the New Fourth Army's military song, using the symphony orchestra's skill in development, accompanied by the high-spirited bugle calls, develops and changes in the midst of intense struggle, vividly portraying a heart-pounding battle to liberate Sha Jianhu. In the segment "Perseverance," the symphony orchestra not only depicts the natural environment of wind and rain but also, through the brass instruments playing the theme of "Eighteen Green Pines," expresses the magnificent scene of the eighteen wounded soldiers bravely fighting against the storm, deeply portraying their sublime spiritual realm of revolutionary heroism.

The symphony "Sha Jianhu" also has unique features in its orchestration. In the scene "Wisdom Struggle," there is a segment of Ah Qing's and Hu Chuanhui and Xiao Deyi's "confession." Three people, three identities, three performances: portraying Hu Chuanhui's ferocity and stupidity, the orchestra uses low brass accompaniment; portraying Xiao Deyi's cunning and viciousness, the orchestra uses the eerie sound of a muted trumpet; in the accompaniment instruments for the positive character Ah Qing, the bright sound of high woodwinds is prominent, forming a sharp contrast with the negative characters. This segment's orchestration arrangement is clear in its love and hate, perfectly bringing out the different appearances of the positive and negative characters.

The symphony "Sha Jianhu" also achieved many successes in experimenting with the combination of Eastern and Western orchestras. The symphony orchestra and national instruments each have their strengths, and as long as they are used well, they can all serve the revolution. In the scene "Perseverance," Guo Jian'guang's solo line "Learn from the green pine on the top of Mount Tai!" is accompanied by the suona, making it especially clear and upright, very distinctive. In the scene "Fish and Water Affection," Guo Jian'guang's singing about the beautiful rivers and mountains of the motherland, the high-pitched plucked strings and harp, and flute combine to vividly depict the "fragrant rice fields and willow-lined banks" of the "silk and rice land of Jiangnan."

The symphony "Sha Jianhu" breaks through the bourgeois symphonic frameworks regarding choral music, making the chorus, Peking opera, and symphony orchestra harmoniously combine. The chorus of "Green Pines" in the segment "Perseverance" fully utilizes the power of mixed chorus, and is processed into polyphony, repeated, with each part rising and falling, mutually responding, creating a grand atmosphere, fully portraying the heroic image of the eighteen wounded soldiers. In the segment "Strategic Planning," the original solo in the Peking opera, Ah Qing's thoughts of the wounded soldiers, is changed to a female chorus and accompaniment, deeply expressing that the people of Yangcheng Lake are all concerned about the New Fourth Army wounded soldiers in the reed marshes, making the fish-and-water affection between the military and people very sincere and moving.

The symphony "Sha Jianhu" retains the characteristics of Peking opera's singing, transitions, and percussion, and harmoniously combines them with the symphony orchestra, chorus, and other forms of expression, forming the unique style of the symphony "Sha Jianhu." This not only opens up a new path for symphonic music but also provides successful experience for Peking opera accompanied by a symphony orchestra.

The symphony "Sha Jianhu" also revolutionizes vocal art. Western singing emphasizes voice, while national singing emphasizes lyrics, each with its advantages and disadvantages. Good singing should absorb the advantages of both Eastern and Western singing, add one's own creativity, achieve "voice and emotion together," and have national characteristics. The singers of the symphony "Sha Jianhu" previously all used Western singing methods, which were quite distant from our national style. They overcame various difficulties and obstacles, learned from Peking opera singers, absorbed the advantages of Peking opera singing, added their own creativity, broke through the traditional falsetto singing of both East and West, combining falsetto and natural voice, taking the first step on the path of vocal revolution pointed out by Comrade Jiang Qing, achieving great success.

The symphony "Sha Jianhu" is a brilliant gem in the treasure house of proletarian literature and art, a shining exemplar of implementing Chairman Mao's policy of "Western learning for Chinese use." It demonstrates the immense power of Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line with "revolutionary political content and the most perfect artistic form."

　　洋为中用的光辉样板
　　——评革命交响音乐《沙家浜》
　　高长音
    三年前，在我们敬爱的江青同志亲自培育下，崭新的革命交响音乐《沙家浜》诞生了！这是世界上第一部真正属于无产阶级和劳动人民的交响音乐。它生动地塑造了无产阶级崇高的英雄形象，热情地歌颂了毛主席人民战争的伟大思想，昂扬地奏出了“枪杆子里面出政权”的凯歌。
    雄壮的管弦乐伴随着震天的锣鼓，揭开了交响音乐《沙家浜》的序幕。红色的天幕上出现了金光闪闪的八个大字：“人民战争胜利万岁”。多么伟大的思想，多么鲜明的主题！
    毛主席教导我们：“枪杆子里面出政权”。是坚持革命的武装斗争，还是贬低甚至取消革命的武装斗争，这是毛主席的革命路线同中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义路线的一个根本分歧。
    在京剧《芦荡火种》改编为京剧《沙家浜》的过程中，我们的伟大领袖毛主席英明地指示：要突出武装斗争，体现人民战争思想，要加强正面英雄人物形象。而中国赫鲁晓夫的干将彭真、周扬等一小撮反革命修正主义分子却公然对抗，叫嚷什么“火药味太浓了”，企图将《芦荡火种》搞成什么《地下联络员》，完全取消武装斗争。江青同志率领革命文艺战士英勇斗争，粉碎了这批反动家伙的罪恶阴谋。京剧《沙家浜》终于突出了武装斗争，形象地表现了“枪杆子里面出政权”的伟大真理。
    交响音乐《沙家浜》在京剧《沙家浜》的基础上，增加了交响乐的特色。在它所增加的序曲和终曲的合唱中，军民高唱“挥战刀举长枪全民武装”，“敢斗争敢胜利紧握枪”，鲜明地揭示了整个作品的主题思想。新四军军歌的运用，《十八青松》和《奔袭》一场中的合唱，以及战斗场面音乐的描写，有力地塑造了赤胆忠心、英勇善战的新四军战士的英雄群象。在集中表现新四军指导员郭建光崇高的精神世界的几个唱段中，由于交响乐队伴奏的烘托，合唱的陪衬，特别是军歌和《十八青松》音乐主题的穿插，使得郭建光和战士的集体形象结合起来，因而变得更高大，更感人，更有代表性。这些英雄形象的塑造，有助于表现作品的主题思想，有力地体现了毛主席要突出武装斗争的光辉指示。
    毛主席教导我们：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”在交响音乐《沙家浜》《鱼水情》一场中，沙奶奶与郭建光亲切、真挚的对唱，以及战士们活跃、热情的伴唱，把军爱民、民拥军，军民亲如一家的革命情谊，刻画得多么淋漓尽致！当鬼子汉奸进占沙家浜后，郭建光和战士们在芦荡想的是“村镇上乡亲们要遭祸殃”，“阶级仇民族恨燃烧在胸膛”；而阿庆嫂和乡亲们在村里想的是“亲人们粮缺药尽消息又断”，“十八个人都和我骨肉相连”。这里，京剧是两段独唱，在交响音乐中加进了合唱，进一步表现了人民和子弟兵深厚的血肉相连的阶级感情。为了掩护和支援子弟兵，地下联络员阿庆嫂勇敢沉着，智斗汉奸胡传葵、刁德一；为了掩护和支援子弟兵，沙奶奶不畏强暴、视死如归，满腔怒火痛斥汉奸卖国贼！阿庆嫂和沙奶奶的高大英雄形象，代表了“千百万真心实意地拥护革命的群众”。交响音乐《沙家浜》以感人的艺术力量体现了这个真理：“军民团结如一人，试看天下谁能敌？”
    毛主席教导我们：“我们不但否认抽象的绝对不变的政治标准，也否认抽象的绝对不变的艺术标准”。交响乐政治内容的大革命，必然引起艺术形式的大革命。交响音乐《沙家浜》在创作过程中面临的一个重大问题就是：敢不敢打破外国资产阶级给交响乐制定的条条框框？能不能大胆创造新的艺术形式以尽可能完美地表现革命的政治内容？中央乐团的革命文艺战士，在毛主席革命文艺路线的指引下，在江青同志的谆谆教导下，坚决走自己的路，打破了资产阶级交响乐的框框，解放了交响乐，创造出了无产阶级交响音乐的新形式。
    交响音乐《沙家浜》成功地发挥了交响乐队的特长。交响乐队这个武器本身是好的，特别是由于有一组完整的铜管乐器，使整个乐队的演奏气势雄伟，刚劲有力。交响乐队的表现手法也有不少优点，比较长于描写战斗场面，表现自然环境和烘托激昂的情绪。交响音乐《沙家浜》创造性地运用了新四军军歌的曲调，不仅作为序曲和终曲的重要部分，而且以主题贯串的手法穿插在各个段落，极大地加强了新四军的英雄形象。在《奇袭沙家浜》一段中，新四军军歌的曲调以交响乐队所擅长的展开手法，伴随着高昂的军号声，在激烈的斗争中不断发展、变化，把一场惊心动魄的解放沙家浜的战斗生动地表现了出来。在《坚持》一段中，交响乐队不但描绘出了风雨交加的自然环境，而且通过铜管乐器奏出的《十八青松》音乐主题的贯串，表现了十八位伤病员与暴风雨英勇搏斗的壮丽情景，深刻地刻画了他们革命英雄主义的崇高精神境界。
    交响音乐《沙家浜》在运用乐队配器方面，也有独到之处。《智斗》一场中有一段阿庆嫂和胡传葵、刁德一三人的“背供”，三个人三种身份，三种地位，三种表演：表现胡传葵的凶恶和愚蠢，乐队用低音铜管伴奏；表现刁德一的阴险毒辣，乐队用带弱音器的小号的怪诞音色伴奏；在正面人物阿庆嫂的伴奏乐器中，则突出高音木管的明亮音色，和反面人物形成鲜明的对比。这一段的配器安排，爱憎分明，恰到好处，把正反面人物的不同面貌突出地表现出来了。
    交响音乐《沙家浜》在试验中西乐队结合方面，也获得了不少成绩。交响乐队乐器和民族乐器，各有所长，只要运用得好，都是可以用来为革命服务的。在《坚持》一场中，郭建光独唱的一句西皮导板“要学那泰山顶上一青松！”配用唢呐伴奏，显得格外嘹亮，格外挺拔，很有特色。《鱼水情》一场，郭建光歌颂祖国大好山河的一段唱，高音弹拨乐器和竖琴、长笛相配合，生动地描绘出“芦花放稻谷香岸柳成行”的“锦绣江南鱼米乡”的景象。
    交响音乐《沙家浜》冲破了资产阶级交响乐关于合唱的框框，使合唱和京剧、交响乐队很好地结合起来。《坚持》一段中的《青松》合唱，发挥了混声合唱的威力，并且处理成复调，加以重复，各声部此起彼伏，相互呼应，气势雄伟，使得十八位伤病员的英雄群象得到了充分的表现。在《授计》一段里，将原来京剧中阿庆嫂思念伤病员的独唱，改用女声合唱和伴唱，深刻地表现出阳澄湖畔的群众都在关心着芦荡中的新四军伤病员，将军民之间的鱼水之情表现得非常真挚，非常感人。
    交响音乐《沙家浜》既保留了京剧的唱腔、过门、打击乐的特色，又和交响乐队、合唱等表现形式和谐地结合在一起，形成了交响音乐《沙家浜》所特有的风格。这就不但为交响乐开辟了一条新的道路，而且为京剧用交响乐队伴奏提供了成功的经验。
    交响音乐《沙家浜》在声乐艺术上也进行了革命。西洋唱法注重声音，民族唱法比较注重字，两种唱法各有优缺点。好的演唱应该吸收中外唱法的一切优点，加上自己的创造，达到“声情并茂”，具有民族的特色。交响音乐《沙家浜》的歌唱演员过去都用洋唱法，和我国民族风格距离很大，他们克服了种种困难和阻力，以京剧演员为师，吸收了京剧唱法的优点，加以创造，突破了中外传统的假声唱法，将假嗓和本嗓结合起来，沿着江青同志指出的声乐革命的道路跨出了第一步，获得了巨大的成绩。
    交响音乐《沙家浜》是无产阶级文艺宝库中一颗光彩夺目的艺术明珠，是贯彻毛主席“洋为中用”方针的光辉样板。它以“革命的政治内容和尽可能完美的艺术形式的统一”，显示了毛主席革命文艺路线的无比威力。
