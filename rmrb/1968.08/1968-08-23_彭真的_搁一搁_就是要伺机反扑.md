Peng Zhen, this villain who has always maliciously cursed and extremely hated revolutionary modern plays, this obstacle to the revolution of Peking Opera, at the 1964 Peking Opera Observation Performance Conference, pretended to say: "Recently, we can put historical plays aside for a while... and get the revolutionary modern plays well-rehearsed, then simultaneously perform a small number of historical plays that use the past to serve the present." Since Peng Zhen agreed to put historical plays aside for a while, does that mean he agreed to perform revolutionary modern plays? No, absolutely not! If we strip off Peng Zhen's disguise, it is not difficult to see what his so-called "putting it aside" is all about.

In 1964, our beloved Comrade Jiang Qing led the proletarian revolutionary forces in the literary and artistic circles to launch a fierce attack on the decadent literature of feudalism, capitalism, and modern revisionism. The sharp edge of this attack made Peking Opera, the most stubborn fortress, undergo great changes in both content and form. Performing revolutionary modern plays and enthusiastically praising workers, peasants, and soldiers became an irresistible trend of the times. Those representatives of the bourgeoisie, remnants of feudalism, and monsters and demons were frightened stiff and restless under such a powerful offensive. Peng Zhen, this two-faced person with decades of experience in counter-revolutionary political struggles, at this time, in order to deceive people, used the strategy of "putting it aside" as a retreat to advance.

What does Peng Zhen's "putting it aside" mean? This is completely a coded message to his accomplices to preserve the strength of old plays and wait for an opportunity to counterattack. Therefore, even those declining-class relics and old scholars in society, after hearing Peng Zhen's speech, were all overjoyed, as if they had taken a tranquillizer, and eagerly spread the word: "Peng Zhen has spoken, old plays are not performed now, but are just put aside, and will eventually return to the stage." This is the footnote to Peng Zhen's "putting it aside" theory.

In 1964, Peng Zhen said even more bluntly in another speech: "Modern Peking Opera is just a passing fad. Once this fad passes, traditional plays will still be performed." Clearly, the "putting it aside" theory that Peng Zhen put forward is completely a smoke screen he threw out in an attempt to counterattack, a nail he drove in for the return of reactionary dramas.

In fact, Peng Zhen loves those old plays that promote feudalism and capitalism so much that he can't even bear to put them aside. This counter-revolutionary revisionist, on the one hand, sings high praises for the revolution of Peking Opera at meetings, on the other hand, secretly invites some "famous performers" to his home in the evening to perform private shows, singing those plays full of feudal poison like "Yu Tang Chun" for his entertainment, and "encourages" those performers to practice hard, declaring that old plays will still be performed in the future. How skillfully this counter-revolutionary two-faced person performs!

Peng Zhen is extremely difficult and hates revolutionary modern plays to the core. He will never let them be well-rehearsed. In the same report, didn't he bare his fangs and slander revolutionary modern plays as being poorly made, "like roasted chestnuts, fried and sold on the spot"? Didn't he still shout at the eve of the Cultural Revolution, "I (Peng Zhen) do not acknowledge what is a model"? Peng Zhen's ridicule and slander of revolutionary modern plays completely exposed his counter-revolutionary two-faced nature.

Chairman Mao said: "False is false, and the disguise should be stripped off." The "putting historical plays aside" theory advocated by the counter-revolutionary revisionist Peng Zhen is absolutely not for the sake of letting revolutionary modern plays be well-rehearsed. On the contrary, it is a counter-revolutionary strategy he was forced to adopt under the strong pressure of the revolution of Peking Opera. Once there is an opportunity, he will throw out all those historical plays soaked in the poison of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism that have been put aside, letting them reoccupy the socialist stage, and strangle all our revolutionary modern plays.

Today, in the magnificent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, China's Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionist Peng Zhen and his ilk have been overthrown, and their dream of performing those old Peking Operas that poison the people in the future has been shattered. However, the enemy will not voluntarily withdraw from the stage of history. They will not resign themselves to failure and will still try to struggle desperately. We must not relax our vigilance. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize and expose the counter-revolutionary literary and artistic black line of China's Khrushchev and Peng Zhen, thoroughly eliminate their poisonous influence, and make those counter-revolutionary historical plays that attempt to subvert the dictatorship of the proletariat and create public opinion for the restoration of capitalism never find a place to be "put aside."

    彭真的“搁一搁”就是要伺机反扑
    上海燎原金属品厂　林深　左军
    彭真，这个一贯恶毒咒骂和极端仇视革命现代戏的大坏蛋，这个京剧革命的拦路虎，在一九六四年京剧观摩演出大会上，装腔作势地说：“最近可以把历史剧稍微搁一搁……把革命的现代戏演顺了手，再同时少量地演一些古为今用的历史剧”。彭真既然同意把历史剧稍微“搁一搁”，那么，他是同意演革命现代戏罗，事实果真如此吗？不是，绝对不是！只要撕下彭真的画皮，就不难看出他这个所谓“搁一搁”到底是个什么货色。
    一九六四年，我们敬爱的江青同志率领文艺界的无产阶级革命派向封建主义、资本主义、现代修正主义的腐朽文艺展开猛烈的进攻，锋芒所向，使得京剧这个最顽固的堡垒，从内容到形式，都发生了极大的变革。大演革命现代戏，热情歌颂工农兵，成了势不可挡的时代潮流。那些资产阶级代表人物、封建余孽和牛鬼蛇神在这种强大的攻势下，吓得目瞪口呆，坐立不安。彭真，这个有几十年反革命政治斗争经验的两面派，此时为了遮人耳目，便使出了“搁一搁”这个以退为进的反革命策略。
    彭真的“搁一搁”是什么意思呢？这完全是一句暗示他的同伙保存旧剧实力以便伺机反扑的黑话。所以，连社会上那一伙没落阶级的遗老遗少，听了彭真的讲话之后，也都喜形于色，简直象吃了一颗定心丸似的奔走相告：“彭真讲话了，老戏现在不演，不过是搁一搁，迟早还是要上台的”。这就是彭真“搁一搁”论的注脚。
    一九六四年，彭真在另一次讲话中说得更加露骨，他说：“京剧现代戏就是一阵风，这阵风过去，还是演传统戏。”可见，彭真抛出来的“搁一搁”论，完全是他妄图伺机反扑所掷出来的一颗烟幕弹，是为反动戏剧重新登台安下的一个钉子。
    其实，彭真对宣扬封建主义和资本主义的旧戏爱得连一搁也不能搁的。这个反革命修正主义分子，一方面在大会上唱京剧革命的高调，另一方面，却偷偷地叫一些“著名演员”，晚上到他家里去唱堂会，去唱那些浸透了封建毒素的《玉堂春》，供他消遣，并“鼓励”那些演员加紧练功，宣称旧戏将来还是要演的。阴一套，阳一套，这个反革命两面派表演得何等淋漓尽致呵！
    彭真对于真正的革命现代戏，是百般刁难恨之入骨的，他是决不让它演顺手的。在同一个报告中，他不是露出毒牙污蔑革命现代戏是粗制滥造，“象糖炒栗子，倒在锅里现炒现卖”吗？他不是在文化大革命前夕还叫嚣“我（彭真）就不承认什么是样板”吗？彭真对革命现代戏的冷嘲热讽，完全暴露了他反革命两面派的丑恶本质。
    毛主席说：“假的就是假的，伪装应当剥去。”反革命修正主义分子彭真所鼓吹的历史戏“搁一搁”论，绝不是为了什么让革命现代戏演顺手，恰恰相反，他是在京剧革命的强大压力下，被迫采取的反革命策略而已。一有机会，他就会把那些搁着的浸透着封、资、修毒汁的反革命历史剧一齐抛出，让他们重新占领社会主义的戏剧舞台，而把我们的革命现代戏统统扼杀。
    今天，在轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命中，中国赫鲁晓夫与反革命修正主义分子彭真之流都被打倒了，他们等待将来再演那些毒害人民的旧京剧的“美梦”破灭了，但是，敌人是不会自动退出历史舞台的，他们决不会甘心自己的失败，他们还在妄图作垂死的挣扎，我们决不能放松自己的警惕性，我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把中国赫鲁晓夫以及彭真的反革命文艺黑线彻底批深批透，彻底肃清其流毒，使那些妄图颠覆无产阶级专政，为复辟资本主义制造舆论的反革命历史剧永远找不到“搁”的地方。
