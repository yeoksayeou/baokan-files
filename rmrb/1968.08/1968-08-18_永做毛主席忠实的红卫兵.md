Under the nationwide situation where red flags are flying high and the country is in a great shape, we welcome our glorious day—August 18. On this exciting day, we hold the red revolutionary book, gaze towards Beijing, and together we wish our beloved red sun, Chairman Mao, eternal life! Eternal life!

We are the Red Guards from the capital and new soldiers of the production and construction corps, standing in the vast land of Northeast China. With revolutionary enthusiasm, we look at the portrait of our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and recall the happiest day two years ago on August 18: that day, the sky above Tiananmen was filled with radiant light, and the red flags of the Red Guards covered Tiananmen Square. Chairman Mao, dressed in a green military uniform and wearing a red Red Guard armband, looked radiant and vigorous, stepping onto the Tiananmen rostrum with a firm stride.

Chairman Mao received us and gave us boundless strength. Under Chairman Mao's warm care and the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, we rode horses and swords, breaking the old bourgeoisie and establishing the new proletariat, sweeping away all the filth of the exploiting classes, and eliminating all the ghosts and snakes.

In the life-and-death struggle between the two headquarters, we Red Guards raised the revolutionary banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against the reactionaries" and, together with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, exposed China's Khrushchev and his agents in various places, seizing back the party, government, financial, and cultural powers they had usurped.

In the fierce battle against the counter-revolutionary "February Countercurrent," we Red Guards, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts, participated in the battle to thoroughly defeat the counterattack of the bourgeois headquarters.

Chairman Mao issued a great call for military and political training, and we Red Guards resolutely support and follow it. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's March 7 instructions and with the help of the People's Liberation Army, the Red Guard movement developed more vigorously and healthily.

Chairman Mao has long pointed out sharply:

"Intellectuals, before they have been integrated with the revolutionary struggles of the masses and before they have decided to serve the masses and unite with them, often have subjective and individualistic tendencies. Their thoughts are often empty, and their actions are often wavering. Therefore, although the broad revolutionary intellectuals in China have the role of a vanguard and a bridge, not all these intellectuals can be revolutionary to the end. ... The shortcomings of intellectuals can only be overcome in long-term mass struggles." Chairman Mao's earnest teachings and the great practice of the Cultural Revolution have made us deeply understand: without integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers, we cannot temper ourselves into successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. Without integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers, we cannot carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end.

"Navigating the vast sea relies on the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." The wise and great helmsman Chairman Mao and the proletarian headquarters have issued a battle order to us: take the road of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers! Go to the countryside! Go to the border! Go to the factories! Go to the grassroots! Chairman Mao instructs me to follow, and Chairman Mao waves his hand for me to advance. We follow the revolutionary path pointed out by Chairman Mao, coming from Beijing to this Mao Zedong Thought school in the border farm, and proudly becoming soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army's agricultural reclamation. Here, there is a vast sky and fertile land, but more importantly, there are many old soldiers and workers who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao. They are heroes who have fought in the south and north, from the army to the border, maintaining the glorious traditions of the People's Liberation Army and the heroic spirit of enduring hardships and hard work for over a decade. They wholeheartedly dedicate themselves to the revolution, devoting their youth and lives to the construction of the border. They are heroic figures shining with the light of Mao Zedong Thought. We will take them as examples, take root in the border, and learn agriculture, industry, and military affairs here. In the three great revolutionary practices of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, and in the long-term struggles of the masses, we will temper our loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, temper ourselves into reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause, and dedicate our youth and precious lives to the most magnificent liberation cause of mankind!

    永做毛主席忠实的红卫兵
    某生产建设兵团的五名首都红卫兵
    在举国上下风卷红旗如画的一片大好形势下，我们迎来自己的光辉节日——八·一八。在这激动人心的日子里，我们手捧红彤彤的革命宝书，眼望着北京，齐声敬祝我们心中的红太阳毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    我们来自首都的红卫兵、生产建设兵团的新战士，站在祖国东北的广阔天地里，满怀革命的豪情，望着最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席画像，回想起两年前八月十八日这个最最幸福的日子：那一天，天安门上，霞光万道，天安门前，红卫兵战旗似海。毛主席身穿绿军装，佩戴着鲜红的红卫兵袖章，神采奕奕，满面红光，健步登上了天安门城楼。
    毛主席接见了我们，给了我们无穷无尽的力量。在毛主席的亲切关怀下，在毛泽东思想的阳光哺育下，我们横刀跃马，纵横驰骋，大破资产阶级的四旧，大立无产阶级的四新，荡涤了一切剥削阶级的污泥浊水，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神。
    在两个司令部的生死决战中，我们红卫兵高举“对反动派造反有理”的革命大旗，和广大工农兵一起，揪出了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在各地的代理人，夺回了被他们窃据的党政财文大权。
    在反击反革命“二月逆流”的激烈战斗中，我们红卫兵在毛主席光辉思想的指引下，参加了彻底击溃资产阶级司令部猖狂反扑的战斗。
    毛主席向我们发出了军政训练的伟大号召，我们红卫兵坚决支持，坚决照办。在毛主席“三·七”指示的指引下，在解放军的帮助下，红卫兵运动更加蓬蓬勃勃地健康发展。
    毛主席早就尖锐地指出：
  “知识分子在其未和群众的革命斗争打成一片，在其未下决心为群众利益服务并与群众相结合的时候，往往带有主观主义和个人主义的倾向，他们的思想往往是空虚的，他们的行动往往是动摇的。因此，中国的广大的革命知识分子虽然有先锋的桥梁的作用，但不是所有这些知识分子都能革命到底的。……知识分子的这种缺点，只有在长期的群众斗争中才能克服。”毛主席这些谆谆教导，文化大革命的伟大实践，使我们深深地懂得：不与工农兵相结合，就不能把自己锻炼成为无产阶级革命事业的接班人。不与工农兵相结合，我们就不能把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
      “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”英明的伟大舵手毛主席和无产阶级司令部向我们发出了战斗号令：走与工农兵相结合的道路！到农村去！到边疆去！到工矿去！到基层去！毛主席指示我照办，毛主席挥手我前进。我们沿着毛主席指出的革命化大道，从北京来到边疆农场这个毛泽东思想大学校里，光荣地成了中国人民解放军的农垦战士。这里有广阔的天宇和富饶的土地，但更重要的是有许多无限忠于毛主席的老军垦战士和老职工。他们是转战南北的英雄，从部队到边疆，十几年来，一直保持着人民解放军的光荣传统和吃大苦耐大劳的英雄本色。他们一心一意干革命，把自己的青春和生命都献给了边疆建设。他们是闪烁着毛泽东思想光辉的英雄人物，我们要以他们为榜样，扎根边疆，在这里学农，学工，学军，在阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验的三大革命实践中，在长期的群众斗争的大风大浪中，锤炼自己对伟大领袖毛主席的一片忠心，把自己锻炼成为无产阶级革命事业的可靠接班人，把自己的青春和宝贵生命，贡献给人类最壮丽的解放事业！
