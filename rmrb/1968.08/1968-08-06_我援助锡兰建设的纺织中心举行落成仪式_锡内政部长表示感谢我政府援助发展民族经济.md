The inauguration ceremony of a textile center built in Ehaliyagoda, southwestern Ceylon, was held on August 3. The machinery for this textile center was provided by China in accordance with the Sino-Ceylonese economic aid agreement.

	The Chargé d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Ceylon, Xi Ye Sheng, was invited to attend the ceremony. In his speech at the ceremony, he praised the development of friendship between the peoples of China and Ceylon. He said that China's aid to Asian and African countries aims to help the recipient countries shake off the influence of colonial economies and embark on the road to economic independence, thereby helping to consolidate and develop their political independence. It is on this principle that China provides aid to Ceylon. Xi's speech was warmly received by the crowd attending the ceremony.

	Ceylon's Minister of Home Affairs, Dahana Yak, also spoke at the ceremony. He expressed heartfelt thanks on behalf of the Ceylonese government to the Chinese government for its aid to Ceylon. He stressed that "China's aid to Ceylon is pure in purpose, aimed at helping the Ceylonese people develop their national economy."
