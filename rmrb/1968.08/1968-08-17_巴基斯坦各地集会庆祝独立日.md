Pakistan celebrated the 21st anniversary of its independence with enthusiastic rallies in major cities across the country on August 14.

President Ayub Khan sent a congratulatory message to the nation on the occasion of Independence Day, saying, "As we joyfully celebrate Independence Day today, our thoughts naturally turn to our fellow countrymen in Jammu and Kashmir who have been deprived of the opportunity to exercise their right to self-determination."

The ruling Muslim League held a public rally in Rawalpindi, passing a resolution reaffirming the Pakistani people's determination to continue the struggle for the liberation of the Kashmiri people from Indian rule.

In his speech at the rally, Muhammad Aslam Khan, the General Secretary of the Muslim League, pointed out that Pakistan is facing a serious threat from India, which has never accepted the existence of an independent Pakistan. He also highly praised the bravery of the Pakistani people in defending their homeland during the Indian armed aggression in September 1965, and called on everyone to be vigilant against new invasions.

    巴基斯坦各地集会庆祝独立日
    新华社拉瓦尔品第十五日电　巴基斯坦全国各大城市十四日热烈庆祝巴基斯坦独立二十一周年。
    阿尤布总统就独立日向全国发出贺电说：“当我们今天欢欣鼓舞地庆祝独立日的时候，我们的思想自然地想到我们的被剥夺行使自决权机会的查谟和克什米尔同胞。”
    执政党穆斯林联盟在拉瓦尔品第的公众集会上通过一项决议，重申巴基斯坦人民要继续为克什米尔人民从印度统治下解放出来而斗争的决心。
    穆斯林联盟总书记萨达尔·穆罕默德·阿斯拉姆汗在会上讲话指出，巴基斯坦面临印度的严重威胁，印度从来不甘心于独立的巴基斯坦的存在。他还高度赞扬巴基斯坦人民在一九六五年九月印度武装侵略期间起来保卫祖国的英勇行为，并号召大家警惕新的侵略。
