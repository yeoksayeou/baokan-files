The mountains are cheering, the seas are singing, cheering and singing for us, the delegates to the Second Conference of Model Companies of the Navy, who have the honor and happiness of seeing our dearest and reddest red sun, our great commander, Chairman Mao.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! When you came to us with a radiant face, full of vigor, and steady steps, the hearts of the naval soldiers bloomed like sunflowers towards you. Our supreme commander is so full of energy and so healthy, this is the greatest happiness for all the people of China and the world!

Respected Chairman Mao! You personally created and led the People's Liberation Army of China. Your military thought and military line are the fundamentals, the direction, the source of strength, and the guarantee of victory for the construction of our army!

The pines and bamboos are evergreen, and the red lanterns shine brightly in Gutian Town. Respected Chairman Mao! You personally presided over the Ninth Party Congress of the Red Fourth Army and wrote the resolution "On Rectifying Erroneous Thoughts in the Party," criticizing bourgeois military thought and various non-proletarian thoughts, establishing the basic line of party work and political work for our army, formulating the great program for building a truly new-type people's army, and illuminating the road of revolutionary construction for our army!

Respected Chairman Mao! It is you who personally stipulated that "standing firmly with the Chinese people and serving them wholeheartedly" is the sole purpose of our army, teaching us to unite with the proletariat and oppressed people of the world, resolutely opposing imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries;

It is you who clearly proposed that politics is the commander, the soul, and political work is the lifeline of our army, and personally established the powerful revolutionary political work of our army;

It is you who personally established the fundamental principles of "unity between the military and the people, unity between the military and the government, unity between officers and soldiers, and unity of the entire army" for our army, creating a series of military principles such as the Three Democracies, the Three Disciplines and Eight Points of Attention, the Three-Eight Style, respect for cadres and love for soldiers, and support for the government and love for the people;

It is you who care most about the construction of our army's companies and grassroots units, emphasizing that "the foundation of the army lies in the soldiers," and personally stipulating that "the party branch should be established at the company level";

It is you who personally established the system of "everyone is a soldier" and implemented the principle of combining field armies, local forces, and militias;

It is you who proposed the grand military program that "the People's Liberation Army should be a great school." This is the great development of your consistent military thought under new historical conditions.

Respected Chairman Mao! You have brilliantly and creatively developed Marxist-Leninist military thought. For the first time in the history of the international communist movement, you systematically solved the theoretical and practical problems of the construction of a proletarian army. Your military thought and military line are the ever-shining treasures in the arsenal of Marxist-Leninist military theory, and the pinnacle of contemporary Marxist-Leninist military thought!

Respected Chairman Mao! The Chinese Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionist elements Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing madly opposed you, opposed your brilliant thoughts, and opposed your revolutionary line. They vigorously opposed, interfered with, and sabotaged the various policies and principles of highlighting proletarian politics proposed by Vice Chairman Lin, especially the strategic significance of the Four Good Companies movement. They castrated the revolutionary soul of the Four Good Companies movement and stuffed it with bourgeois military views. They also stirred up the evil wind of large-scale competitions, madly attacking politics. Your kind instructions and Vice Chairman Lin's repeated directives gave us powerful ideological weapons, boosted our fighting spirit, and guided us in an unyielding struggle against the Chinese Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionist elements Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing!

Respected Chairman Mao! Your big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters" roared out, bringing the stormy winds of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, finally washing out the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents from their dark corners! Their ugly faces are fully exposed in the sunlight, and their bourgeois headquarters are smashed to pieces!

"Navigating the great sea relies on the helmsman, making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." Respected Chairman Mao! The experience of the Chinese revolution has countless principles, the experience of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has countless principles, firmly implementing and thoroughly executing your proletarian revolutionary line is the most fundamental principle; the experience of our army's construction has countless principles, the experience of the navy's construction has countless principles, firmly implementing and thoroughly executing your proletarian military line is the most fundamental principle. Following you is loyalty to the party and the people; following you is victory!

Respected Chairman Mao! The proletarian headquarters led by you and Vice Chairman Lin is our sole leadership center. At this crucial moment of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we, the broad masses of naval soldiers, will definitely unite closely around the proletarian headquarters led by you, under your great guidance, unify our will, unify our steps, and unify our actions. We will firmly and unswervingly implement every directive of yours, follow your great strategic deployment, eliminate interference from all sides, defend the proletarian headquarters led by you and Vice Chairman Lin, stand guard, keep watch, build a strong army, and fight well. Together with the entire army and the people of the country, we will achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

　　在毛主席的伟大建军路线指引下前进
　　出席海军第二次四好连队代表大会的全体同志
    山在欢呼，海在歌唱，欢呼和歌唱我们出席海军第二次四好连队代表大会的全体同志，光荣地、幸福地见到了我们心中最红最红的红太阳，我们的伟大统帅毛主席。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！当您容光焕发，神采奕奕地迈着稳健的步伐来到我们面前的时候，海军战士的颗颗红心象朵朵葵花一样幸福地向您开放。我们的最高统帅精力这样充沛，身体这样健康，这是全中国、全世界人民最大最大的幸福！
    敬爱的毛主席！您亲手缔造和领导了中国人民解放军。您的军事思想和建军路线，是我军建设的根本，前进的方向，力量的源泉，胜利的保证！
    苍松翠竹万古常青，古田镇上红灯高照。敬爱的毛主席！您亲自主持的红四军第九次党代表大会和亲笔为大会写出的决议《关于纠正党内的错误思想》，批判了资产阶级军事思想和各种非无产阶级思想，确立了我军党的工作和政治工作的基本路线，制定了建设真正新型人民军队的伟大纲领，照亮了我军革命化建设前进的道路！
    敬爱的毛主席！是您，亲手规定了“紧紧地和中国人民站在一起，全心全意地为中国人民服务”为我军的唯一宗旨，教导我们联合全世界无产者和被压迫者，坚决反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派；
    是您，明确提出政治是统帅，是灵魂，政治工作是我军的生命线，并且亲手建立了我军强有力的革命政治工作；
    是您，亲手为我军确立了“军民一致，军政一致，官兵一致，全军一致”的根本原则，创建了三大民主、三大纪律八项注意、三八作风、尊干爱兵、拥政爱民等一系列建军原则；
    是您，最关心我军连队和基层建设，强调“军队的基础在士兵”，并且亲手规定把“支部建在连上”；
    是您，亲手确立“实行全民皆兵”的制度，实行野战军、地方军、民兵三结合的原则；
    是您，提出了“人民解放军应该是一个大学校”的宏伟建军纲领。这是您的一贯建军思想在新的历史条件下的伟大发展。
    敬爱的毛主席！您天才地、创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义军事思想，在国际共产主义运动史上，第一次系统地解决了无产阶级军队建设的理论和实践问题。您的军事思想和建军路线，是马克思列宁主义军事学说武库中永放光彩的珍宝，是当代马克思列宁主义军事思想的顶峰！
    敬爱的毛主席！中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿，疯狂地反对您，反对您的光辉思想，反对您的革命路线。他们竭力反对、干扰和破坏林副主席提出的突出无产阶级政治的各项方针原则，特别是破坏具有战略意义的四好连队运动的开展。他们阉割四好连队运动的革命灵魂，塞进资产阶级单纯军事观点的私货。他们还刮起大比武的妖风，疯狂地冲击政治。您老人家的亲切教导和林副主席的历次指示，给了我们强大的思想武器，鼓舞了我们的战斗信心，引导着我们同中国赫鲁晓夫及彭德怀、罗瑞卿等反革命修正主义分子进行了不屈不挠的斗争！
    敬爱的毛主席！您的《炮打司令部》大字报的一声巨响，唤来了无产阶级文化大革命的急风暴雨，终于把中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人从阴暗的角落里冲刷了出来！他们的丑恶嘴脸在太阳光下暴露无遗，他们的资产阶级司令部被砸了个稀烂！
      “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”敬爱的毛主席！中国革命的经验千条万条，无产阶级文化大革命的经验千条万条，坚决贯彻、彻底执行您的无产阶级革命路线是最根本的一条；我军建设的经验千条万条，海军建设的经验千条万条，坚决贯彻、彻底执行您的无产阶级建军路线是最根本的一条。紧跟您，就是忠于党忠于人民；紧跟您，就是胜利！
    敬爱的毛主席！以您为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部是我们唯一的领导中心。在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的关键时刻，我们广大海军战士，一定紧紧团结在以您老人家为首的无产阶级司令部的周围，在您的伟大思想指引下，统一意志，统一步伐，统一行动，坚定不移地贯彻执行您老人家的每一项指示，紧跟您老人家的伟大战略部署，排除来自各方面的干扰，为保卫以您为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，站好岗，放好哨，建好军，打好仗，和全军、全国人民一道，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。（附图片）
