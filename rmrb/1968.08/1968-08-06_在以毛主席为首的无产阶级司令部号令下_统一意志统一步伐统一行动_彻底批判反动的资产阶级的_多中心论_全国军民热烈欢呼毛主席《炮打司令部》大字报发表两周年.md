In the great march to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the hundreds of millions of military and civilian people across the nation, with deep proletarian feelings of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, warmly celebrate the second anniversary of Chairman Mao's "Bombard the Headquarters" big-character poster. They review the battle course of advancing from victory to victory over the past two years under the guidance of Chairman Mao's big-character poster and a series of his latest instructions. They have carefully studied Chairman Mao's epoch-making big-character poster and the important editorial "Under the Leadership of the Proletarian Headquarters Led by Chairman Mao, Unite!" published in the People's Daily. They have been greatly inspired. The hundreds of millions of military and civilian people declare that they will definitely unite more closely under the leadership of the Proletarian Headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, unite in will, step, and action, thoroughly smash the reactionary "multi-center theory," closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, advance along Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

In recent days, from the capital to the border, from cities to the countryside, various places across the nation have held various meetings to solemnly commemorate the second anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's "Bombard the Headquarters" big-character poster. Many places have seen large numbers of military and civilian people taking to the streets to parade, expressing their determination to resolutely carry out all the battle orders of the Proletarian Headquarters led by Chairman Mao. In the commemorative activities held in various places, the broad masses of military and civilian people have repeatedly raised their arms and shouted, "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" "Wish Chairman Mao eternal youth! Eternal youth!"

Following the Proletarian Headquarters Led by Chairman Mao Is Victory

Under the brilliant illumination of the great leader Chairman Mao's "Bombard the Headquarters" big-character poster, the hundreds of millions of military and civilian people across the nation who have achieved decisive victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, review the battle course of the past two years, and are even more inspired with boundless love and loyalty to Chairman Mao. They say, the experience of the past two years can be discussed in a thousand ways, in ten thousand ways, but the most important and fundamental point is: following the great leader Chairman Mao is victory, following the Proletarian Headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin is victory.

The revolutionary workers of Shanghai No. 17 Cotton Mill say, the great leader Chairman Mao's "Bombard the Headquarters" big-character poster deeply exposes the essence of the reactionary bourgeois line, pronounces the death sentence on the bourgeois headquarters led by China's Khrushchev, sounds the charge for the proletariat's all-out counterattack against the bourgeoisie, greatly boosts the morale of the proletariat, and greatly dampens the arrogance of the bourgeoisie! At every critical moment in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it is Chairman Mao's big-character poster and a series of wise decisions that have enabled us to advance from one victory to another. From more than two years of struggle practice, we have gained a deeper understanding that as long as we are infinitely loyal to the Proletarian Headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and earnestly implement and resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's every latest instruction, we will be invincible, and we can overcome any great difficulty.

The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Luwangzhuang Commune's Taoyuan Production Brigade in Hebei Province, inspired by Chairman Mao's big-character poster, have waged a series of head-on struggles against China's Khrushchev and his stinking wife, seized back the leadership power usurped by China's Khrushchev's agents, and thoroughly criticized the counter-revolutionary "Taoyuan Experience" they concocted, making this brigade undergo earth-shaking changes. The poor and lower-middle peasants of this brigade, on the second anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's big-character poster, re-studied Chairman Mao's big-character poster, and everyone was in high spirits and full of vigor. They declared that they would definitely carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, thoroughly criticize and expose China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary fallacies, and resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Year Siwang, a good soldier of Chairman Mao who is on duty at a factory in Taiyuan, Shanxi Province, re-read Chairman Mao's "Bombard the Headquarters" big-character poster and excitedly said: Chairman Mao's big-character poster is the charge for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the guiding light for our advance, the magic weapon for victory, and the mighty spiritual atomic bomb. All our victories are achieved under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the wise leadership of the Proletarian Headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. In our advance, we deeply feel that Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions and all the battle orders of the Proletarian Headquarters must be resolutely carried out and thoroughly implemented.

The nationally famous agricultural labor model Li Shunda said, the hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses across the nation, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's "Bombard the Headquarters" big-character poster and a series of his latest instructions, have smashed the bourgeois headquarters led by China's Khrushchev and carried out extensive exposure, struggle, and criticism against them, making us even more hateful of China's Khrushchev and even more loving of the great leader Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao is our savior; the Proletarian Headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin is the headquarters that guarantees our socialist iron-clad mountain will never change color and guarantees that we will never suffer twice. Whoever opposes the leadership of the Proletarian Headquarters led by Chairman Mao is our enemy, and we will overthrow them! We must closely unite around the Proletarian Headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, together with the broad masses of the people, better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, grasp revolution and promote production, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Thoroughly Criticize the Reactionary "Multi-Center Theory," Unite in Will, Step, and Action Under the Orders of the Proletarian Headquarters

The broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, and revolutionary masses in various places, while warmly celebrating the second anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's "Bombard the Headquarters" big-character poster, have all firmly declared that at this crucial moment of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must more closely unite around the Proletarian Headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, thoroughly criticize the reactionary "multi-center theory," resolutely unite in will, step, and action under the orders of the Proletarian Headquarters, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The revolutionary miners of the Red Anshan, the source of the workers' movement personally opened up by the great leader Chairman Mao, said, we have known since more than forty years ago when Chairman Mao first came to Anshan that only Chairman Mao is the red sun in our miners' hearts. The struggle practice of the past two years in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has enabled us to further realize that the Proletarian Headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin is the only leadership center that represents the fundamental interests of our working class. China's Khrushchev, this great traitor and saboteur, has tried every means to distort the history of Anshan, attempting to remove the reddest red sun from our miners' hearts and achieve his evil goal of usurping the party and the state. In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao's "Bombard the Headquarters" big-character poster, like a spring thunder, has shattered China's Khrushchev's plot. We miners of Anshan, following the Proletarian Headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, have welcomed the decisive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution with our fighting hands. In the new situation of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a small handful of desperate class enemies are desperately spreading the "multi-center theory," interfering with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and obstructing the implementation of the proletarian revolutionary line. We must severely criticize them. We, the working class, are determined to unite around the Proletarian Headquarters, resolutely carry out all the orders of the Proletarian Headquarters, and continue to play the role of the main force in the great struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The broad revolutionary cadres of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau, with the glorious revolutionary tradition of "February 7," said, Chairman Mao is the greatest leader of our working class and revolutionary people, and the Proletarian Headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin most concentratedly represents the fundamental interests of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses. We must resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's every latest instruction and every battle order of the Proletarian Headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. We must thoroughly criticize the erroneous idea of "me as the center," further strengthen the proletarian concept of the whole, strengthen revolutionary organizational discipline, closely unite around the Proletarian Headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, timely expose all the tricks of the class enemies, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and advance victoriously.

The active learning and applying of Chairman Mao's works advanced collective, the North Sea Fleet's certain unit where An Yemin served, has been rated as "four goods" for seven consecutive years and has been awarded collective first, second, and third-class merits multiple times. The officers and soldiers, linking their unit's growth experience, said, our unit has achieved today because we have only one center in our hearts, which is the Proletarian Headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. Following Chairman Mao, our minds are clear, our direction is clear, and following Chairman Mao is victory. The reactionary "multi-center theory" is a reverse current and evil wind in our course of advance, which must be thoroughly criticized and resolutely eliminated, and we must not allow the "multi-center theory" to interfere with the implementation of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

The advanced collective of active learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought, Yang Mingsheng, the party branch secretary of Hongjin Production Brigade in Taicang County, Jiangsu Province, said, in the sky, the stars revolve around the Big Dipper, and ten thousand stars revolve around the sun. In our hearts, poor and lower-middle peasants, there is only one Proletarian Headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. What "multi-center theory" and "me as the center" are all rubbish against Mao Zedong Thought. We poor and lower-middle peasants will wield iron brooms to sweep them into the garbage heap. Whatever the Proletarian Headquarters says, we will do; whatever the Proletarian Headquarters guides, we will advance; whatever the Proletarian Headquarters calls for, we will attack; we will follow every strategic deployment of the Proletarian Headquarters step by step. Following the great commander Chairman Mao, we will advance from victory to new victories.

Resolutely Carry Out All the Battle Orders of the Proletarian Headquarters, and Resolutely Achieve a Comprehensive Victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution

The broad revolutionary masses, revolutionary cadres, and PLA officers and soldiers across the nation, while solemnly commemorating the second anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's "Bombard the Headquarters" big-character poster, have resolved to unconditionally implement all the battle orders of the Proletarian Headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, further strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, strengthen the struggle against the enemy, carry out extensive and long-term revolutionary criticism, thoroughly clean up the class ranks, eliminate the poison of China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, complete the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation on all fronts, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The members of the revolutionary committee of Xingguo County, a revolutionary old base area personally established by the great leader Chairman Mao, said, to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, we must truly be infinitely loyal to the Proletarian Headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, strive to actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, and establish a revolutionary academic style that combines theory with practice. They said, the people of Xingguo relied on a heart infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao to create "first-class work" in the days of war. In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the heroic people of Xingguo, with a heart infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, closely followed Chairman Mao's great battle orders and a series of wise decisions in the "Bombard the Headquarters" big-character poster, achieving one great victory after another. They declared that in the new situation, they would definitely more closely unite around the Proletarian Headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, sharpen their eyes, expose the various tricks of the class enemies attempting to sabotage Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, strive to create new "first-class work," and fight to the end for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

The revolutionary teachers and students of Beijing Caochangdi Middle School, who have achieved certain results in the educational revolution, said, all the achievements we have made are the result of closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, especially Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We study Mao Zedong Thought to use it. Studying it but not using it is a verbal revolutionary, a "giant in words, dwarf in deeds." Those who speak well but do not earnestly carry out Chairman Mao's latest instructions in action, whose heads are swollen, and who deviate from Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, or even distort the highest instructions, will inevitably slip into a dangerous pit.

The comrades of the Sichuan Self-Defense Department of the Chengdu Military Region, an advanced collective of active learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought, known as the "red flag for supporting the left," declared that they would definitely, under the wise leadership of the Proletarian Headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, help the broad revolutionary masses build a good proletarian revolutionary government, making the newly-born revolutionary committees into revolutionary battle command departments that are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and resolutely carry out all the orders of the Proletarian Headquarters.

The members of the revolutionary committee of Tianjin Maflax Factory and the broad revolutionary masses today jointly reviewed the battle course they have gone through under the great battle orders of Chairman Mao's "Bombard the Headquarters." They deeply felt that whenever we resolutely act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, we feel that we stand high, see far, speak with principles, and act with methods, and the masses support us and we will definitely win the battle. Whenever we do not study Chairman Mao's instructions well and do not understand them deeply, we feel that we lack a mainstay, our words are ineffective, and our actions are unsuccessful. They firmly declared that regarding Chairman Mao's instructions, we will carry out those we understand and also carry out those we do not understand temporarily, deepening our understanding in the process of carrying them out. Wherever Chairman Mao points, we will strike, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

The workers of Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Factory warmly celebrate the second anniversary of the publication of the great commander Chairman Mao's "Bombard the Headquarters" big-character poster. They declare that they will resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's series of extremely important latest instructions and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    连日来，从首都到边疆，从城市到农村，全国各地纷纷举行各种集会，隆重纪念毛主席《炮打司令部》的大字报发表两周年。许多地方的广大军民上街游行，表示要坚决贯彻毛主席的无产阶级司令部的一切战斗号令。在各地举行的纪念活动中，广大军民不断振臂高呼：“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”“祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”
    紧跟以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部就是胜利
    在伟大领袖毛主席《炮打司令部》大字报的光辉照耀下，夺得了无产阶级文化大革命决定性胜利的全国亿万军民，回顾两年来的战斗历程，更加激发了对毛主席的无限热爱和无限忠诚。他们说，两年来的体会可以谈一千条，谈一万条，最重要最根本的一条是：紧跟伟大领袖毛主席就是胜利，紧跟以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部就是胜利。
    上海国棉十七厂的革命职工说，伟大领袖毛主席《炮打司令部》的大字报，最深刻地揭露了资产阶级反动路线的本质，宣判了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部的死刑，吹响了无产阶级全面反击资产阶级的进军号，大长了无产阶级的志气，大灭了资产阶级的威风！在无产阶级文化大革命的每一个关键时刻，是毛主席的大字报和一系列英明决策，使我们不断从胜利走向新的胜利。我们从两年多来的斗争实践中更加深刻地认识到，只要我们无限忠于以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，对毛主席的每一个最新指示认真落实，坚决照办，我们就无往而不胜，天大的困难也能克服。
    河北省卢王庄公社桃园大队贫下中农和革命干部，在毛主席大字报的鼓舞下，同中国赫鲁晓夫和他的臭老婆作了一系列针锋相对的斗争，夺回了被中国赫鲁晓夫的代理人篡夺了的领导大权，把他们炮制的反革命的“桃园经验”批得臭不可闻，使得这个大队发生了翻天覆地的巨大变化。这个大队的贫下中农在毛主席大字报发表两周年的时候，重新学习了毛主席的大字报，人人兴高采烈，精神振奋。他们表示，一定要发扬无产阶级的彻底革命精神，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，把中国赫鲁晓夫的一套反革命谬论彻底批倒批臭，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    正在山西太原市某工厂执勤的毛主席的好战士年四旺，重温了毛主席《炮打司令部》的大字报，激动地说：毛主席的大字报，是无产阶级文化大革命的进军号，是照耀我们前进的指路明灯，是克敌制胜的法宝，是威力无比的精神原子弹。我们的一切胜利，都是在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的英明领导下取得的。我们在前进中深深体会到，对毛主席的一系列最新指示，对无产阶级司令部的一切战斗号令，必须坚决执行，彻底照办。
    全国著名的农业劳动模范李顺达说，全国亿万革命群众在毛主席《炮打司令部》的大字报和一系列最新指示指引下，摧毁了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，并且对他们进行了大揭发，大斗争，大批判，使我们对中国赫鲁晓夫更加仇恨，对伟大领袖毛主席更加热爱。毛主席是我们的救命恩人；以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，是保证我们社会主义铁打江山永不变色、保证我们不再吃二遍苦的司令部。谁反对以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的领导，谁就是我们的敌人，我们就打倒谁！我们一定要紧紧地团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部周围，同广大人民群众一道更好地活学活用毛泽东思想，全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，狠抓革命，猛促生产，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    彻底批判反动的“多中心论”，在无产阶级司令部的号令下统一意志统一步伐统一行动
    各地广大工农兵和革命群众，在热烈欢呼毛主席《炮打司令部》的大字报发表两周年的时候，大家都坚定地表示，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的关键时刻，我们一定要更加紧密地团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的周围，彻底批判反动的“多中心论”，坚决在无产阶级司令部的号令下统一意志，统一步伐，统一行动，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    伟大领袖毛主席亲手开辟的工人运动策源地红色安源的革命矿工说，我们从四十多年前毛主席第一次到安源，就明白了只有毛主席才是我们矿工心中的红太阳。两年来文化大革命的斗争实践，使我们更进一步认识到，以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，是代表我们工人阶级根本利益的唯一的领导中心。中国赫鲁晓夫这个大工贼、大叛徒千方百计篡改安源的历史，妄图从我们矿工心中摘去最红最红的红太阳，实现其篡党篡国的罪恶目的。在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，毛主席《炮打司令部》的大字报，象一声春雷，粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫的阴谋。我们安源矿工紧跟以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，用战斗的双手迎来了无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利。在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的新形势下，一小撮穷途末路的阶级敌人，竭力散布“多中心论”，干扰毛主席的伟大战略部署，妨碍无产阶级革命路线的贯彻执行，我们必须狠狠批判。我们工人阶级决心团结在无产阶级司令部的周围，坚决执行无产阶级司令部的一切号令，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大斗争中继续发挥工人阶级主力军的作用。
    具有“二七”革命光荣传统的郑州铁路局广大革命职工说，毛主席是我们工人阶级和革命人民最伟大的领袖，以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，最集中地代表了无产阶级和广大革命人民群众的根本利益，是全党、全军、全国和广大革命群众唯一的领导中心。我们对毛主席的每一个最新指示，对以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的每一个战斗号令，都必须坚决照办，坚决执行。我们必须彻底批判“以我为中心”的错误思想，进一步加强无产阶级的整体观念，加强革命的组织纪律性，紧紧团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部周围，及时识破阶级敌人的一切阴谋诡计，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，乘胜前进。
    海军活学活用毛主席著作先进集体、北海舰队某部安业民生前所在连队，连续七年被评为四好，先后多次荣立集体一等功、二等功、三等功。指战员们联系连队成长的经历说，我们连队有今天，就是因为我们心中只有一个中心，这就是以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部。紧跟毛主席，心明眼亮方向清，紧跟毛主席就是胜利。反动的“多中心论”，是我们前进航程中的逆流和歪风，必须彻底批判，坚决清除，决不容许“多中心论”干扰毛主席革命路线的贯彻执行。
    活学活用毛泽东思想先进集体、江苏省太仓县洪泾大队党支部书记杨明生说，天上群星朝北斗，万颗行星绕太阳。我们贫下中农心窝里，只有一个以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部。什么“多中心论”、“以我为中心”，统统是反毛泽东思想的破烂货。我们贫下中农要挥起铁扫帚，把它扫进垃圾堆。无产阶级司令部怎么说，我们就怎么做；无产阶级司令部怎么指引，我们就怎么前进；无产阶级司令部怎么号召，我们就怎么进攻；无产阶级司令部的每个战略部署，我们步步紧跟。紧跟伟大统帅毛主席，从胜利走向新的胜利。
    坚决执行无产阶级司令部的一切战斗号令，誓夺无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利
    全国各地广大无产阶级革命派、革命群众和人民解放军指战员，在隆重纪念毛主席《炮打司令部》大字报发表两周年的时候，决心不折不扣地贯彻执行以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的一切战斗号令，步步紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，进一步加强无产阶级专政，加强对敌斗争，深入持久地开展革命大批判，切实做好清理阶级队伍的工作，肃清中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义路线的流毒，完成各条战线上的斗、批、改任务，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    伟大领袖毛主席亲手创立的革命老根据地兴国县的革命委员会成员们说，要做到紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，就必须真正做到对以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部无限忠诚，努力活学活用毛泽东思想，树立理论和实际相结合的革命学风。他们说，当年兴国人民就是凭着一颗无限忠于毛主席的红心，在战火纷飞的年代里创造出来了“第一等的工作”。在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，英雄的兴国人民又怀着无限忠于毛主席的红心，紧跟毛主席《炮打司令部》的伟大战斗号令和一系列英明决策，夺得一个又一个的伟大胜利。他们表示，在新形势下，一定要更加紧密地团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部周围，擦亮眼睛，识破阶级敌人妄图破坏毛主席伟大战略部署的各种阴谋诡计，努力创造新的“第一等的工作”，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利而战斗到底！
    在教育革命中取得了一定成绩的北京草场地中学革命师生说，我们所取得的一切成绩，都是紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，活学活用毛主席著作，特别是活学活用毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的一系列最新指示的结果。我们学习毛泽东思想就是为了用，学了不用就是口头革命派，就是“言语的巨人，行动的矮子”。那种嘴上讲得好听，而行动上却不认真执行毛主席最新指示，头脑膨胀，背离毛主席伟大战略部署，甚至歪曲最高指示的人，就势必滑到危险的泥坑里去。
    成都部队活学活用毛泽东思想先进集体、被誉为“支左红旗”的四川自贡市人民武装部的同志们表示，一定要在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部英明领导下，帮助广大革命群众建设好无产阶级的革命政权，使新生的革命委员会成为无限忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席革命路线，坚决执行无产阶级司令部一切号令的革命战斗指挥部。
    天津麻纺厂革委会成员和广大革命群众，今天共同回顾了在毛主席《炮打司令部》的伟大战斗号令下所走过的战斗历程。他们深有体会地说，每当我们坚决按照毛主席指示办事的时候，就感到站得高，看得远，说话有纲，办事有方，群众就拥护，就一定会打胜仗。每当我们对毛主席的指示学得不好，领会不深的时候，就感到缺少主心骨，说话不灵，办事不成。他们坚定地表示，对于毛主席的指示，理解的要执行，暂时不理解的也要执行，在执行中加深理解。毛主席指向那里，我们就打向那里，步步紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！（附图片）
