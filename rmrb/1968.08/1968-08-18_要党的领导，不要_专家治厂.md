Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must have proletarian politics in command, and follow the path of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory in training technical personnel from among the workers. We must select students from among workers and peasants who have practical experience, send them to school for a few years, and then have them return to production practice." Chairman Mao's brilliant directive is the great guideline for the proletarian educational revolution and the beacon for China's industrial revolution. It pronounces the complete bankruptcy of the "expert line" of the Chinese Khrushchev, truly boosting the morale of the proletariat and crushing the arrogance of the bourgeoisie!

In the past, under the protection of the Chinese Khrushchev's "expert management," a handful of capitalist roaders within our factory placed some remnants of the Kuomintang, disguised as "experts" and "engineers," in key positions, usurping the leadership of many departments. These people were arrogant and overbearing. They would say, "I have the technology," and "You all must listen to me," and they would slander us workers as "only knowing how to swing a hammer, not how to use our brains." In reality, these people were the real ignoramuses. A bourgeois "textile expert" had long held sway over our spinning and drawing frame workshop. He treated the workers with great arrogance and put on a big show. He did not trust the workers but only himself, saying, "In the textile industry, I call the shots," and "What do you workers know about mechanical principles? You just do your work, and I'll solve the technical problems." He was always scheming to control, oppress, and restrict the workers, setting countless rules and regulations for them. He would say these rules and regulations were "sacred and inviolable," and the workers "could not overstep them." This self-proclaimed bourgeois "expert" turned a modern workshop into a mess.

The surging tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution swept away all obstacles. We criticized the bourgeois technical "authorities." With the help of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the factory, we established a revolutionary leading group for the workshop, with the main leaders being two workers who had only attended a few years of primary school and were promoted from among the workers. After the establishment of the workshop revolutionary leading group, we vigorously emphasized proletarian politics, intensively studied Chairman Mao's works, intensively carried out class struggle, intensively carried out revolutionary criticism, and intensively carried out the ideological transformation of the people, using revolution to lead production, promote production, and advance production. The revolutionary masses were liberated from the numerous rules and regulations that controlled, oppressed, and restricted them, and their spiritual outlook underwent a tremendous change. They truly became masters of the house, each with high morale and vigorous spirit. Comrades said, "Now we have a burning heart and a clenched fist, ready to work hard in the revolution and production!"

Revolution is the liberation of productive forces, and revolution is the promotion of the development of productive forces. Now our spinning and drawing frame workshop is a scene of prosperity, with production booming and production tasks being far exceeded.

From the tremendous changes in our spinning and drawing frame workshop before and after, the true nature of the bourgeois "experts" as paper tigers was fully exposed, and at the same time, the reactionary essence of the Chinese Khrushchev's "expert management" was deeply revealed. The Chinese Khrushchev shouted loudly about "expert management," demanding that "people with engineering backgrounds should be factory directors," aiming to let those bourgeois "experts" take the stage, usurp the leadership of production technology, usurp the leadership of the Party, and implement dictatorship over the workers, preparing conditions for the restoration of capitalism. Therefore, in industrial construction, the struggle between the two lines is whether to insist on political leadership, strengthen the Party's leadership, carry out mass movements, implement the two participations, one reform, and three combinations, and carry out technological revolution, or to oppose the emphasis on proletarian politics and implement "expert management." The essence of the struggle is whether to build socialism or capitalism; the focus of the struggle is ultimately the issue of power, that is, the issue of which class holds power (including technical power). The Chinese Khrushchev used the banner of "expert management" to seize power, change proletarian dictatorship into bourgeois dictatorship, and restore capitalism. For such a serious political conspiracy, we must not be complacent and must thoroughly expose and criticize it!

We workers are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and infinitely love socialism. We do not seek fame or wealth but dedicate ourselves to revolution and production. We have accumulated rich practical experience in production year after year on the front lines. We are not only revolutionary pioneers but also masters of production technology. We must wield the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought to thoroughly bury the fallacy of "expert management" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev and seize the leadership of technology from the hands of the bourgeois "experts."

### 要党的领导，不要“专家治厂”

    要党的领导，不要“专家治厂”
    北京维尼纶厂牵切纺车间　杨学工
    毛主席教导我们：“要无产阶级政治挂帅，走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路。要从有实践经验的工人农民中间选拔学生，到学校学几年以后，又回到生产实践中去。”毛主席这一光辉指示，是无产阶级教育革命的伟大纲领，是我国工业革命的指路明灯，宣判了中国赫鲁晓夫的“专家路线”的彻底破产，真是大长了无产阶级的志气，大灭了资产阶级的威风！
    过去在中国赫鲁晓夫“专家治厂”的保护伞下，我厂党内一小撮走资派，把一些披着“专家”、“工程师”外衣的国民党残渣余孽，安插在重要岗位上，窃取了不少部门的领导权。这些家伙趾高气扬，不可一世。他们张口“老子有技术”，闭口“你们都得听我的”，还污蔑我们工人是“只会抡锤，不会用脑”。其实这些家伙才是地地道道的不学无术的蠢驴。一个资产阶级“纺织专家”，长期把持着我们牵切纺车间的大权。他对待工人神气十足，架子摆得很大。他不相信工人，只相信他自己，说什么“纺织业我说了算数”，“你们工人懂多少机械原理？你们只顾干活好了，技术难题由我解决。”他整天在管、压、卡工人方面打算盘，给工人订了数不尽的清规戒律。还说什么这些条条框框“神圣不可侵犯”，工人“不能越轨”。这个自命不凡的资产阶级“专家”，就这样把一个现代化的车间，搞得乌七八糟。
    无产阶级文化大革命的滚滚洪流，冲决了一切障碍。我们批判了资产阶级技术“权威”。在驻厂支左解放军的帮助下，我们成立了车间革命领导小组，主要负责人是两个仅上过几年小学，由工人提拔的干部。车间革命领导小组成立后，就大力突出无产阶级政治，狠抓毛主席著作学习，狠抓阶级斗争，狠抓革命的大批判，狠抓人的思想革命化，以革命统帅生产，带动生产，促进生产。广大革命职工从管、压、卡他们的一些清规戒律中解放出来，精神面貌发生了巨大变化，他们真正当家作主了，个个斗志昂扬，意气风发。同志们说：“现在心里怀着一团火，拳头上攥着一把劲，要在抓革命促生产上大干一场！”
    革命就是解放生产力，革命就是促进生产力的发展。现在我们牵切纺车间是一片欣欣向荣的景象，生产蒸蒸日上，大大地超额完成了生产任务。
    从我们牵切纺车间前后巨大变化中，淋漓尽致地暴露了资产阶级“专家”的纸老虎原形，同时也深刻地揭露了中国赫鲁晓夫“专家治厂”的反动本质。中国赫鲁晓夫声嘶力竭地鼓吹“专家治厂”，叫嚷要“工程师出身的人去当厂长”，就是要让那些资产阶级“专家”上台，篡夺生产技术领导大权，篡夺党的领导，对工人实行专政，为复辟资本主义准备条件。因此，在工业建设上，是坚持政治挂帅，加强党的领导，大搞群众运动，实行两参一改三结合，大搞技术革命，还是反对突出无产阶级政治，实行“专家治厂”，这一直是企业中两条路线的斗争。斗争的实质，是搞社会主义，还是搞资本主义；斗争的焦点，归根到底，还是一个政权问题，也就是由那个阶级掌握大权（包括技术大权）的问题。中国赫鲁晓夫打出“专家治厂”的幌子，就是为了夺取政权，变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政，从而复辟资本主义。对于他这样一个严重的政治阴谋，我们决不能掉以轻心，必须彻底揭穿，批倒批臭！
    我们工人阶级无限忠于毛主席，无限热爱社会主义，我们不为名，不为利，一心为革命而生产。我们成年累月战斗在生产第一线，积累有丰富的生产实践经验。我们不但是革命的闯将，而且也是生产技术的主人。我们一定要奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，彻底埋葬中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“专家治厂”谬论，从资产阶级“专家”手里把技术领导大权也夺过来。
