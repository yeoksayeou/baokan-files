The British Labour government, mired in a fiscal crisis, has suffered another heavy blow: Britain's trade deficit for July surged by 60% compared to June, reaching £80 million. This figure, announced on the 13th, caused the pound to plummet against foreign currencies on the London financial market.

Britain's massive trade deficit in July is another indication of the deepening fiscal and economic crisis in the British Empire. According to figures released by the British Board of Trade, exports increased only slightly this month, while imports were unprecedentedly high. Compared to June, the increase in import value was almost eight times the increase in export value.

In an attempt to alleviate the severe fiscal crisis, the British Labour government has been ruthlessly extracting more from the people while seizing every opportunity to expand exports since the devaluation of the pound last November, hoping to reverse the trend of annual trade deficits and improve Britain's balance of payments. However, the government's plans have been thwarted by harsh realities. This year, Britain's average monthly trade deficit has been £71 million, compared to £46 million last year and £9 million the year before. Such a massive trade deficit will inevitably worsen Britain's balance of payments and make the fragile pound even more vulnerable to fluctuations.

Many British newspapers have expressed shock and anxiety over the massive July trade deficit. The *Times* editorial on the 14th, in a state of panic, declared that Britain's July trade figures were "so terrible that it must be asserted once again that devaluation is failing." The *Daily Mirror* criticized Prime Minister Wilson for boasting to foreigners not long ago about Britain being on the "highway to economic miracles," only to end up embarrassed. The paper lamented that Britain's July trade figures showed that the country was on the "narrow path to economic disaster."

### 财政经济危机不断加深的又一表现  英国七月份对外贸易逆差猛增

    财政经济危机不断加深的又一表现
    英国七月份对外贸易逆差猛增
    新华社伦敦十四日电　深陷在财政危机之中的英国工党政府最近遭到了又一次沉重的打击：英国七月份的对外贸易逆差比六月份猛增百分之六十，达到八千万镑。这个数字在十三日宣布之后，在伦敦金融市场上英镑同外国货币的比价大大下跌。
    英国七月份对外贸易逆差巨大是英帝国财政经济危机不断加深的又一表现。根据英国贸易部公布的数字，这个月英国的出口增加不多，而进口却空前庞大。同六月份相比，进口值的增加几乎等于出口值增加的八倍。
    英国工党政府为了缓和严重的财政危机，在加紧向人民横征暴敛的同时，一直千方百计利用去年十一月英镑贬值后国际市场上英国商品价格下降的条件，竭力扩大出口，企图扭转对外贸易连年有巨额逆差的趋势，从而改善英国的国际收支状况，使贬值后地位仍然岌岌可危的英镑稳定下来。但是，工党政府的如意算盘在无情的现实面前碰了壁。今年以来，英国的对外贸易逆差平均每月高达七千一百万镑，而去年每月平均为四千六百万镑，前年每月平均则为九百万镑。如此巨大的对外贸易逆差势必大大恶化英国的国际收支情况，并且使脆弱的英镑更加经不起风吹草动。
    英国不少报纸都为七月份对外贸易逆差的庞大而震惊不安。《泰晤士报》十四日的社论惊惶失措地说，英国七月份的对外贸易数字是“如此可怕，以至于必须再一次断言（英镑）贬值正在失败”。《每日镜报》则不满首相威尔逊不该在不久前对外国人乱吹牛皮，说什么英国已经“走上通向经济奇迹的康庄大道”，现在落得丢脸出丑。这家报纸叹道，英国七月份的对外贸易数字表明，英国走的路“是通向经济灾难的羊肠小径”。
