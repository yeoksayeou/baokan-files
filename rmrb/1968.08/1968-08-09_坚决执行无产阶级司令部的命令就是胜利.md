Firmly Execute the Orders of the Proletarian Headquarters is Victory
Beijing Shijingshan Middle School Revolutionary Committee

Two years ago, our great leader Chairman Mao issued the epoch-making big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters," and personally directed the formulation of the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Concerning the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," pronouncing the death sentence on the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev. Over the past two years, hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses throughout the country, under the unified command of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and launched a fierce attack on the handful of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist-roaders, and all counterrevolutionaries headed by China's Khrushchev, smashing this bourgeois headquarters to smithereens and bringing it to total collapse, achieving decisive victory and now striving for complete victory in the Cultural Revolution.

The situation in our Shijingshan Middle School is also excellent. Especially last March, Chairman Mao sent us our comrades-in-arms, the People's Liberation Army, to help us with military and political training. Under the assistance of the PLA, the entire school's revolutionary teachers and students have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly implementing the battle commands of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, achieving one victory after another.

We have firmly executed and bravely defended Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the "March 7" directive, swiftly realizing revolutionary great unity based on teaching classes, and establishing a revolutionary committee combining the three elements; in accordance with Chairman Mao's instruction to "resume classes and carry on the revolution," we formally resumed classes and carried on the revolution in early April last year. After resuming classes, the entire school's revolutionary teachers and students have extensively, deeply, and persistently carried out revolutionary criticism and struggle, thoroughly criticizing China's Khrushchev's bourgeois reactionary line and counterrevolutionary revisionist educational line, and in the struggle, consolidating and developing the revolutionary committee.

All our victories have been achieved under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. Through more than two years of practice in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we deeply feel that as long as we firmly execute the commands of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, and unconditionally implement Chairman Mao's latest directives, we can overcome any difficulties and smash any plots and sabotage activities of the class enemy. Vice Chairman Lin pointed out: "Mao Zedong Thought is the unified action program for the entire Party, the entire army, and the people of the whole country." "The entire Party and the people of the whole country must unite around Chairman Mao as the center and unite around Mao Zedong Thought as the center." The proletarian headquarters headed by the great leader Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin most concentratedly represents the fundamental interests of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses. It is the sole leadership center formed and tested in long-term struggle. Our entire Party, the entire army, and the people of the whole country can only have this one center and cannot have a second center. Unlimited loyalty to the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, closely uniting around this headquarters, and firmly executing all its commands will enable us, in the fierce struggle between the two classes and the two lines, to timely expose and smash the plots and tricks of the class enemy, advancing from one victory to another. If we do not execute the directives of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, like some people who become swollen-headed and want to have their own "center," and who, while outwardly complying, inwardly resist, and who execute only what suits their taste and do not execute what does not, then this completely goes against the fundamental interests of the entire Party, the entire army, and the people of the whole country, and will cause one to deviate from the revolutionary track of the proletariat and slide into the evil swamp of opposing the proletarian headquarters.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Never forget class struggle." Some people with ulterior motives advocate the reactionary "multi-center theory," which is actually not "no center" but a plot to sabotage the "center." They attempt to sabotage the leadership center of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, in order to preserve or restore the reactionary center headed by China's Khrushchev. "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." We proletarian revolutionaries and the broad revolutionary masses must thoroughly criticize the reactionary "multi-center theory," firmly defend the sole leadership center of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, and resolutely struggle against all words and deeds that harm this leadership center, and defend to the death the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin.

On the occasion of the second anniversary of the issuance of Chairman Mao's big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters" and the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Concerning the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," we resolve to unite even more closely around the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, under the commands of the proletarian headquarters, unify our will, unify our steps, and unify our actions, firmly implement Chairman Mao's series of latest directives, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

　　坚决执行无产阶级司令部的命令就是胜利
　　北京市石景山中学革命委员会
    两年前，我们的伟大领袖毛主席发表了具有划时代意义的《炮打司令部》的大字报，并亲自主持制定了《中国共产党中央委员会关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》，宣判了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部的死刑。两年来，全国亿万革命群众在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的统一指挥下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，向以中国赫鲁晓夫为总代表的一小撮叛徒、特务、死不改悔的走资派和一切反革命分子发动了猛烈进攻，把这个资产阶级司令部打得落花流水，土崩瓦解，取得了决定性的胜利，并正在夺取文化大革命的全面胜利。
    和全国一样，我们石景山中学的形势也是一片大好。特别是去年三月，毛主席派来了亲人解放军，帮助我们进行军政训练。在解放军帮助下，全校革命师生紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚决贯彻执行以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的战斗号令，取得了一个又一个胜利。
    我们坚决执行和勇敢捍卫了毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命伟大战略部署的“三·七”指示，迅速实现了以教学班为基础的革命大联合，成立了三结合的革命委员会；按照毛主席“复课闹革命”的指示，于去年四月初就正式复课闹革命。复课后，全校革命师生广泛深入、持久地开展革命大批判，彻底批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线和反革命修正主义教育路线，在斗争中巩固和发展了革命委员会。
    我们的一切胜利，都是在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部领导下取得的。经过两年多无产阶级文化大革命的斗争实践，我们深深体会到，只要坚决执行以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的号令，不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示，我们就能克服任何困难，就能粉碎任何阶级敌人的阴谋破坏活动。林副主席指出：“毛泽东思想是全党全军全国人民的统一行动纲领。”“全党和全国人民，都要以毛主席为中心来团结，以毛泽东思想为中心来团结。”以伟大领袖毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，最集中地代表了无产阶级和广大革命人民群众的根本利益，它是在长期斗争中形成的，是久经考验的唯一的领导中心。我们全党、全军、全国人民只能有这样一个中心，不能有第二个中心。无限忠于毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，紧紧团结在这个司令部的周围，坚决执行这个司令部的一切号令，就能使我们在两个阶级、两条路线的激烈斗争中，及时识破和粉碎阶级敌人的阴谋诡计，从胜利走向胜利。如果不执行以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的指示，象有些人那样，头脑膨胀，要搞什么“以我为中心”，对于无产阶级司令部的号令，阳奉阴违，口是心非，符合自己胃口的就执行，不符合自己胃口的就不执行，那就完全违背了全党、全军、全国人民的根本利益，就会脱离无产阶级革命轨道，滑到反对无产阶级司令部的罪恶泥坑里去。
    毛主席教导我们说：“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”。有些别有用心的人鼓吹反动的“多中心论”，实际上并不是“不要中心”，而是阴谋破坏“中心”。他们妄图破坏以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的领导中心，以便保存或者恢复以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部这个反动的中心。“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”我们无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，一定要彻底批判反动的“多中心论”，坚决捍卫毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部这个唯一的领导中心，坚决同各种损害这个领导中心的言行作斗争，誓死保卫以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部。
    在纪念毛主席《炮打司令部》大字报和《中国共产党中央委员会关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》发表两周年的日子里，我们决心更紧密地团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的周围，在无产阶级司令部的号令下，统一意志，统一步伐，统一行动，坚定不移地落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
