The flames of armed peasant revolution sparked in Naxalbari are burning. Peasants in the Tray region of Uttar Pradesh, North India, have taken the revolutionary road.

New Delhi, August 20 (Xinhua) - The August issue of the Indian revolutionary magazine "Liberation" reports that the armed peasant revolutionary struggle ignited last year in the Naxalbari area of Darjeeling District, West Bengal, has now spread to the Tray region of Uttar Pradesh.

The report says: The revolutionary peasants of the Tray region in Lakimpur District of Uttar Pradesh, under the guidance of the revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India, have taken the revolutionary road, that is, the Naxalbari road. The "zamindars" (landlords) and big landlords are furious and have been trying to suppress them continuously. Recently, one day, they sent about a hundred hired thugs armed with guns to "teach" the peasants a lesson. These thugs surrounded the revolutionary peasants and began shooting at them. The shooting continued for some time. However, the peasants, who are familiar with the local terrain, avoided direct confrontation with them at first and hid, waiting for the opportunity. The peasants reorganized their forces and, together with the local people, launched an attack on this armed gang of thugs at an opportune moment. Fifteen of the thugs were injured, and one of them reportedly died later. Not a single revolutionary peasant was injured.

The report says: The news of the evil attack on the revolutionary peasants and their active resistance and victory has stirred up a new wave of enthusiasm among the peasant masses, greatly deepening their hatred and indignation towards the landlords who oppress them. Angry peasants surrounded some of the landlords' houses, seized grain, took away the landlords' guns, and gave the landlords the punishment they deserved.

The report says: "To suppress the newly awakened peasant masses and protect the landlords, the reactionary state government has sent a large force of three thousand armed police and issued arrest warrants for seventy-five revolutionary peasants. However, the local residents, mainly composed of oppressed peasants, are actively supporting and assisting the revolutionaries, thwarting all police attempts to find them. The reactionary government, frustrated and enraged, is trying to organize a vicious campaign of terror to deal with the revolutionary peasants and the people."

    在纳萨尔巴里点燃的农民革命武装斗争火焰正在燃烧
    印度北方邦特莱地区农民走上革命道路
    新华社二十日讯　新德里消息：印度革命刊物《解放》月刊八月号报道，去年在印度西孟加拉邦大吉岭县纳萨尔巴里地区点燃的农民革命武装斗争的火焰，现在蔓延到了北方邦特莱地区。
    报道说：北方邦拉基姆普尔县特莱地区的革命农民，在当地共产党革命派的指导下走上了革命的道路，即纳萨尔巴里道路。“柴明达”（印地语“地主”）和大地主对此感到恼怒，不断地试图镇压他们。最近有一天，他们派遣了约一百名雇佣的暴徒携带枪支去
  “教训”农民。这些暴徒包围了革命的农民，并且开始向农民们开枪射击。这种射击继续了一些时候。但是，对当地地形了如指掌的农民们，避免立即同他们发生直接冲突，而是先隐蔽起来，等待时机。农民们重新组织了自己的力量，并且同当地人民团结起来，在一个适当的时机向这批武装暴徒发动了攻击。有十五名暴徒被打伤，其中一人据说在后来死了。革命的农民没有一人伤亡。
    报道说：对革命农民发动罪恶的进攻和革命农民积极抵抗得胜的消息，在农民群众中掀起了一股新的热情，大大地加深了他们对压迫他们的地主的仇恨和义愤。愤怒的农民包围了一些地主的房子，抢走了粮食，夺走了地主的枪支，并且给予地主应有的惩罚。
    报道说：“为了镇压新觉悟的农民群众和保护地主，反动的邦政府已派出一支由三千名武装警察组成的大部队，并且对七十五名革命农民发出了逮捕令。但是，主要由被压迫的农民组成的当地居民，正在积极地支持和帮助革命者，挫败警察试图找到他们的一切尝试。反动政府在遭到挫折后恼羞成怒，正在试图组织一次凶狠的恐怖运动，来对付革命的农民和人民。”
