The village is red, the fortress is red, and the people are even redder. The Party branch secretary of the Tongjia Brigade in Baoting County, Hainan, and an active learner of Chairman Mao's works in Hainan, Chen Shiren.

The Five-Fingered Mountain peaks connect with peaks,
They cannot compare with Chairman Mao's great kindness;
The Five Rivers flow into rivers,
They cannot compare with the happiness of the people's commune.

The red sun rises in the east,
The sun's rays illuminate the Five-Fingered Mountain, making the Li and Miao villages bright.
Chairman Mao has saved us Li and Miao poor and lower-middle peasants from the hell of oppression and exploitation.
We burned the land contracts of the Li and Miao tyrants,
We divided the grain and land of the landlords and evil gentry, Wang Long and Ao Ya;
The lives of the Li and Miao slaves, Long Zi and Miao Nu, as oxen and horses, are gone forever.
But in the early days of liberation, the individual ownership in the countryside was weak and fragile. The primitive farming methods of slash-and-burn agriculture could not escape the extreme poverty and disasters left over from the old society, and could not change the backward appearance of the poor mountains and bad waters. Some poor and lower-middle peasants still had to borrow money and sell land, watching the Long Zi and Miao Nu, who had stood up, still had to live a bitter life again.

The great leader Chairman Mao timely instructed us: "Only socialism can save China." Ten years ago, he issued the great directive to the people of the whole country: "The people's commune is good." Chairman Mao is the closest to us poor and lower-middle peasants. Chairman Mao's great teachings have illuminated the direction for us Li and Miao poor and lower-middle peasants to advance. The more than one hundred households of Li and Miao poor and lower-middle peasants in our entire brigade, scattered in the deep mountains and old forests within dozens of kilometers, heard Chairman Mao's extremely affectionate voice and immediately became excited. Everyone immediately took action and established a people's commune. From then on, the Li and Miao people have embarked on the broad road to common prosperity. The poor and lower-middle peasants say: The people's commune is a thousand-year flower of happiness, a ten-thousand-year fruit of happiness. The road is getting wider and wider, collective production is getting more and more prosperous, and everyone praises the beautiful days.

For ten years, we Li and Miao poor and lower-middle peasants have followed Chairman Mao's instructions in everything, firmly advancing along the socialist road in rural areas. No matter how the wind rages on the plain, or how the waves roll in the lake, our determination to walk the path of the commune is as firm as steel! The Chinese Khrushchev and his agents maliciously slandered the people's commune as "established too early" and "mismanaged," saying that the people's commune is "not suitable for minority areas," vigorously advocating the revisionist black goods of "three autonomies and one contract," and spreading the evil wind of "contracting production to households." The local capitalists-in-command, following their master's orders, forcibly ordered the commune to be disbanded and production to be contracted to households, implementing individual farming. The landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements in the countryside also came out one after another, following the slander of the commune as "exhausting the people and injuring the finances, collapsing in three years," shouting and demanding to disband and farm individually. For a time, dark clouds rolled across the sky, but we Li and Miao poor and lower-middle peasants remained steadfast, with unyielding hearts and straight backs, standing tall and firm. We followed Chairman Mao's great instruction to "never forget class struggle," conducted extensive class struggle education, and conducted extensive comparisons between the two societies, two systems, and two roads. The bitterness of class struggle aroused the deep hatred of the poor and lower-middle peasants: How can we forget the days of selling ourselves to the Li and Miao tyrants to be Long Zi and Miao Nu! How can we repeat the life of living in the wild mountains, eating wild fruits, and wearing tree bark! We cannot possibly go back to the old ways and suffer again! Everyone said: "Fish die when separated from water, infants die when separated from their mothers, poor and lower-middle peasants cannot be separated from the large collective of the commune; even if the Five-Fingered Mountain peaks collapse and the Five Rivers flow backward, our determination to walk the socialist collectivization road will not waver." The poor and lower-middle peasants exposed the evil plot of the Chinese Khrushchev to restore capitalism in the countryside and resolutely fought against the evil wind of "contracting production to households." We neither disbanded the commune nor contracted production to households, but firmly believed in the great instruction of "the people's commune is good," actively promoting collective production. In this way, after a fierce struggle, we Li and Miao poor and lower-middle peasants, relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, dispersed the evil wind of individual farming spread by the Chinese Khrushchev, and became even more determined to walk the socialist road.

People change their thoughts, the earth changes its clothes. We are armed with Mao Zedong Thought, with the heroic spirit of changing the heavens and the earth, fighting against nature, and daring to make the poor mountains wear new clothes. The people's commune has many people, great strength, high spirits, and great enthusiasm. Even the greatest difficulties can be overcome. We followed Chairman Mao's great instruction of "learning from Dazhai in agriculture," resolutely taking the self-reliant and arduous path of Dazhai. We carried out extensive water and soil conservation and basic construction. We built dams to block floods, built sluices to control water, and built irrigation canals and power stations along the rivers. Every canal runs through the fields, every barren hill becomes a terrace, and every saline-alkali land becomes a double-crop field. From then on, a thousand-year grain-deficient village became a prosperous grain-producing area. In the past, our brigade relied on state relief grain every year, but now we deliver more than 200,000 jin of surplus grain to the state every year. Now, livestock farms are everywhere in the entire brigade, economic forests cover the mountains and hills, and processing plants, schools, clinics, and stores have been built. Newly built roads lead to every village and fortress. In short, the ten years of the commune have brought about earth-shaking changes to our Li and Miao villages. The face of the countryside has changed in countless ways, all thanks to the illumination of Mao Zedong Thought and the path of the people's commune.

Mao Zedong Thought cultivates new people, the people's commune illuminates the new village, the village is red, the fortress is red, and the people are even redder. Every day, the men, women, old, and young of our Li and Miao villages face the east, towards the sun, singing "The East is Red," wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! We persistently study Chairman Mao's latest instructions every day, unshakably and unchangingly. We hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes in the fields, on the land, and in the family. The revolutionary criticism and denunciation fire burns more fiercely. Every production team in the village sets up a Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team, establishes a revolutionary propaganda platform, opens cultural rooms and night schools, and everywhere is a sea of loyalty to Chairman Mao. Many white-haired old men and women, who used to not even remember their own age, can now recite dozens of Chairman Mao's quotations and the "Three Old Articles" fluently. In the past, the Miao people could only use corn kernels in a bamboo tube to record work points, but now they have become pioneers of revolutionary criticism and denunciation. Children who have just learned to speak can sing "The East is Red" and shout "Long live Chairman Mao!" A new generation of Li and Miao people is growing up. Many have become active learners of Chairman Mao's works, good cadres and members of the party and the people, and some have even gone to Beijing to see our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao. The heavens are great, the earth is great, but not as great as Chairman Mao's kindness. Weaving the most beautiful flowers of the Li and Miao people cannot express our deep affection for Chairman Mao; singing the most beautiful mountain songs of the Li and Miao people cannot praise enough the happiness brought by the people's commune. Chairman Mao is our great savior, and the people's commune is the golden bridge to communism. How can we not shout loudly: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the people's commune!

    村红寨红人更红
    海南岛保亭县铜甲大队党支部书记海南区学习毛主席著作积极分子  陈世仁
    五指山哟峰接峰，比不上毛主席的恩情高；
    五条河哟条接条，比不上人民公社的幸福长。
    东方升起红太阳，太阳的光辉把五指山黎村苗寨照得亮堂堂；毛主席把我们黎族苗族贫下中农救出了受压迫、受剥削的地狱。我们焚毁了黎头、苗霸的田契地约，分得了王龙、奥雅（地主、恶霸）的粮食、田地；龙仔、苗奴（长工、奴隶）当牛做马的生活一去不复返了。可是，解放初期，农村中的个体所有制力单底薄，刀耕火种的个体生产无法摆脱旧社会遗留下来的极端贫困和灾难，改变不了穷山恶水的落后面貌。有的贫下中农还得借债卖地，眼看着翻了身的龙仔、苗奴还要再过苦日子。
    伟大的领袖毛主席及时教导我们：“只有社会主义能够救中国。”十年前，他老人家又向全国人民发出“人民公社好”的伟大指示。毛主席和我们贫下中农最亲最亲，毛主席的伟大教导，照亮了我们黎族苗族贫下中农前进的方向。我们全大队的一百多户黎族苗族贫下中农，分散居住在方圆几十公里的深山老林，听到了毛主席无比亲切的声音，立即欢腾起来。大家立即行动起来，成立了人民公社。从此，我们黎族苗族人民走上了共同富裕的康庄大道。贫下中农说：人民公社化，是千年的幸福花，万年的幸福果，道路越走越宽广，集体生产越搞越兴旺，美好的日子人人夸。
    十年来，我们黎族苗族贫下中农处处按照毛主席的指示办事，坚定不移地沿着农村社会主义道路前进。任凭平地起狂风，那管平湖卷恶浪，我们走公社化道路的决心坚如钢！中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人恶毒地诽谤人民公社“办早了”、“搞糟了”，胡说什么人民公社“在少数民族地区不适宜”，大肆鼓吹“三自一包”、“四大自由”的修正主义黑货，大刮“包产到户”的单干妖风。本地区的走资派秉承他主子的旨意，强行下令分社拆队，包产到户，实行单干。农村中的地富反坏分子也纷纷出笼，跟着污蔑公社化“劳民伤财，三年垮台”，大叫大嚷拆伙单干。一时，乌云滚滚盖天飞，但是，我们黎族苗族贫下中农始终大志不移，红心不变，挺直腰杆，顶天立地。我们按照毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，大抓阶级斗争教育，大搞两个社会、两种制度、两条道路的回忆对比。阶级的苦水激发起贫下中农的深仇大恨：卖身给黎头、苗霸做龙仔、苗奴的日子那能忘记！野居深山吃野果披树皮的生活怎能重演！要我们走回头路、吃二茬苦万万办不到！大家都说：“鱼儿离水就渴死，婴儿离娘就断气，贫下中农离不开公社化的大集体；就是五指山峰崩塌，五条河水倒流，我们走社会主义集体化道路志不移。”贫下中农戳穿了中国赫鲁晓夫妄图在农村复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋，坚决地和“包产到户”的单干黑风展开了针锋相对的斗争。我们一不拆社分队，二不包产单干，永远坚信“人民公社好”的伟大教导，积极搞好集体生产。就这样，经过激烈的斗争，我们黎族苗族贫下中农依靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，驱散了中国赫鲁晓夫刮的单干妖风，更加坚定了走社会主义道路的信心。
    人换思想地换装。我们用毛泽东思想武装起来，以改天换地的英雄气概，与天斗，与地斗，敢叫穷山换新装。人民公社人多力量大，热气高，干劲足，天大的困难也能克服。我们遵循毛主席“农业学大寨”的伟大教导，坚决走大寨自力更生、艰苦创业的道路。我们大搞水土改造和基本建设。拦洪造坝，挡水建闸，道道水坝截断河间，个个扬水站、发电站座落河边，条条渠道纵横田间，块块荒坡变梯田，洼碱地变成了年年丰收的双造田。从此，千年的缺粮村变成了富足的米粮乡。过去，我们大队年年依靠国家救济粮食，现在，年年向国家交售二十多万斤余粮。如今遍布全大队的畜牧场到处是牛羊家禽，漫山遍野的经济林一眼望不到尽头。大队还建设了碾米站、木工厂、榨油厂，设立了小学校、卫生院、保健站、商店。新修的公路通进了村村寨寨。总之，公社化的十年，使我们黎村苗寨发生了翻天覆地的变化。农村的面貌千变化，万变化，全靠毛泽东思想的照耀，全靠走人民公社化道路。
    毛泽东思想育新人，人民公社光辉映新村，村红寨红人更红，毛主席的书读了眼亮心更明。每天，我们黎村苗寨的男女老幼迎着东方，向着朝阳，高唱《东方红》，祝福毛主席万寿无疆！学习毛主席最新指示天天坚持，雷打不动，风雨不改。田头、地头、家庭举办了毛泽东思想学习班。革命大批判烈火越烧越旺。村寨的生产队都组织了毛泽东思想宣传队，设立了革命宣传台，办起了文化室、夜校，处处都是对毛主席的“忠”字海洋。许多白发苍苍的老大爷、老大娘以往连自己年龄都记不清，现在，却能滚瓜烂熟地背下几十条毛主席语录和“老三篇”。过去只能用包米粒放进竹筒里记工分的苗家人，如今变成了革命大批判的闯将。刚懂话的小孩童就会唱《东方红》，会喊“毛主席万岁！”黎族苗族一代新人正在成长。多少人成为学习毛主席著作积极分子，成为党和人民的好干部、好社员，有的还到北京见到了我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席。天大地大不如毛主席的恩情大。绣出黎族苗家最美丽的百花，表不尽我们对毛主席的深情；唱出黎族苗家最美好的山歌，说不完人民公社带来的幸福。毛主席是我们的大救星，人民公社是通往共产主义的金桥。我们怎能不放声欢呼：毛主席万岁！人民公社万岁！
