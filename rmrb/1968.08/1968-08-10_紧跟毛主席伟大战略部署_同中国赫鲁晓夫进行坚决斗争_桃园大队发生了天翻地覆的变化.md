Closely Follow Chairman Mao's Great Strategic Deployment and Resolutely Fight Against the Chinese Khrushchev

The Peach Garden Brigade Experiences a Heaven-Shaking, Earth-Shattering Change

New China News Agency, Shijiazhuang, August 9 – The Peach Garden Brigade of Luning County, Hebei Province, which was once used by the Chinese Khrushchev as an experimental field for restoring capitalism, has undergone a tremendous change. Under the inspiration of Chairman Mao's big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters" and guided by the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which was personally drafted by Chairman Mao, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres have, over the past two years, engaged in a relentless struggle against the Chinese Khrushchev, his wife Wang XX, and their agents in the Peach Garden Brigade. They have thoroughly smashed their evil plot to restore capitalism, making the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line deeply rooted in people's hearts, and the proletarian dictatorship more consolidated. The entire brigade has undergone a heaven-shaking, earth-shattering change. Every time the poor and lower-middle peasants of the Peach Garden Brigade talk about the great situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they are filled with boundless excitement and say: "Parents are dear, but not as dear as Chairman Mao. It is Chairman Mao who has brought light back to our Peach Garden. Chairman Mao is the eternal red sun in our hearts."

"The 'Sixteen Points' Bring Chairman Mao's Voice"

Two years ago, Chairman Mao's big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters" and the "Sixteen Points" personally drafted by Chairman Mao were like a spring thunder, shaking all of China and inspiring hundreds of millions of revolutionary people to launch a fierce attack on the bourgeois headquarters headed by the Chinese Khrushchev. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of the Peach Garden Brigade heard this news and were so happy that they shed tears of joy. However, Wang XX, the wife of the Chinese Khrushchev, who stayed in Peach Garden with her so-called "consolidation team," and the agents of the Chinese Khrushchev in Peach Garden, such as Guan Jingdong, were terrified of Chairman Mao's big-character poster and the "Sixteen Points." They hid the newspapers carrying the "Sixteen Points" and did not let them be seen by the masses. At the same time, they further intensified the implementation of the bourgeois reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev, labeling many poor and lower-middle peasants as "counter-revolutionaries" and "ghosts and monsters on the capitalist road." However, dark clouds cannot block the sun. The poor and lower-middle peasants found the newspapers carrying the "Sixteen Points," copied them overnight, and distributed them to every household for study. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants excitedly said: "The 'Sixteen Points' bring Chairman Mao's voice!" They used the "Sixteen Points" as a weapon, analyzed the situation in the Peach Garden Brigade, further recognized the reactionary nature of the Chinese Khrushchev, his wife Wang XX, and Guan Jingdong, and bravely broke out from under the white terror of the bourgeois reactionary line. They loudly shouted the slogans "Down with the Chinese Khrushchev!" "Down with Wang XX!" "Down with Guan Jingdong!" and successfully held a struggle meeting against Guan Jingdong, seizing the leadership of the brigade from the hands of the agents of the Chinese Khrushchev such as Guan Jingdong and placing it in the hands of the proletariat and the poor and lower-middle peasants. Subsequently, all the poor and lower-middle peasants in the brigade, together with the revolutionary masses and Red Guards from nearby counties and cities and from other places, held a mass rally of ten thousand people. They denounced and exposed the harm caused by the "left" in form but right in essence bourgeois reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev to Peach Garden and rectified the wrongs done to the original Party branch secretary of the Peach Garden Brigade, Wu Chen, the deputy secretary Zhao Shuzhen, and other comrades who were labeled as "bad elements" by the Chinese Khrushchev and Wang XX. From then on, the situation in Peach Garden changed dramatically. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and, following the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, launched a great denunciation, exposure, criticism, and struggle against the Chinese Khrushchev, his wife Wang XX, and their agents in the Peach Garden Brigade. The tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the entire brigade surged forward.

"Chairman Mao, Our Savior, We Cannot Be Apart for a Moment!"

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants angrily exposed that Wang XX, the wife of the Chinese Khrushchev, during her so-called "Four Cleanups" in Peach Garden from 1963 to 1964, never mentioned our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and never talked about Chairman Mao's great contributions to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. Instead, she seized every opportunity to praise the Chinese Khrushchev, saying at every meeting, "As XX (referring to the Chinese Khrushchev) instructed," "XX sent me here." She also vigorously promoted the black "Cultivation," attempting to corrupt the poor and lower-middle peasants. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants firmly said in their exposure and criticism: "Chairman Mao is our most beloved savior. The more the Chinese Khrushchev and his stinking wife oppose Chairman Mao, the more we must be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Chairman Mao, revolutionary for life, and loyal to Chairman Mao for life." They angrily tore down the portraits of the Chinese Khrushchev that were forced to be hung up by his agents and hung up the portraits of our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's quotations. They eagerly studied Chairman Mao's works. Now, with the help of the PLA propaganda team for Mao Zedong Thought, the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary members in this brigade have set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes in every household, and everyone has "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." Studying, reciting, lecturing, and using the "Three Articles" and actively applying Chairman Mao's latest instructions have become the primary need of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and community members. They said with deep proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao: "Chairman Mao, our savior, we cannot be apart for a moment; we think of Chairman Mao every moment, and we have energy throughout our bodies."

"We Must Thoroughly Criticize and Expose the Chinese Khrushchev to Protect the Socialist Homeland!"

The Chinese Khrushchev sent his wife Wang XX to Peach Garden to carry out the so-called "Four Cleanups" and thoroughly restore capitalism. She meticulously created the infamous anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought poisonous weed "Peach Garden Experience." Wang XX once boasted and spread poison about this black "experience" in Beijing, Tianjin, and other places. Later, the Chinese Khrushchev stole the name of the Central Committee to distribute this black "experience" nationwide. However, the Chinese Khrushchev and his wife Wang XX, along with their agents, were always afraid to let the poor and lower-middle peasants of Peach Garden know about this black document. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, after the poor and lower-middle peasants of Peach Garden saw the so-called "Peach Garden Experience," everyone was indignant. Originally, the Chinese Khrushchev and his wife Wang XX, out of their wolfish ambitions to restore capitalism, included in this black document the extensive promotion of the "left" in form but right in essence bourgeois reactionary line and the peddling of counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods. They also distorted facts, fabricated charges, and maliciously slandered the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of the Peach Garden Brigade. There were as many as one hundred and seventy places where they distorted facts, fabricated charges, and did not match the actual situation in Peach Garden. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in the Peach Garden Brigade were extremely angry and said: The Chinese Khrushchev and his stinking wife are utterly evil. They distort facts and slander us poor and lower-middle peasants like this. We must settle accounts with them! The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, presented facts and reasoned, criticizing this black "experience" point by point. Over the past two years, they have held more than 1,500 criticism meetings and posted more than 20,000 big-character posters, thoroughly criticizing the anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought poisonous weed "Peach Garden Experience" and the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods of the Chinese Khrushchev, such as the "theory of the extinction of class struggle," "four freedoms," and "three selfs and one package." The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants said: We can go without food and sleep, but we cannot go without criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev. Only by thoroughly criticizing and exposing the Chinese Khrushchev can the roots of Mao Zedong Thought be firmly planted, and the socialist homeland be protected!

"Selflessness is the right path for us poor and lower-middle peasants!"

Our great leader Chairman Mao issued the great call to "criticize and repudiate revisionism and fight selfishness." This struck a chord with the hearts of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Peach Garden. The brigade, production teams, and community families successively held Mao Zedong Thought study classes, frequently held meetings to share experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and everyone strove to transform their worldview.

The Chinese Khrushchev and his wife Wang XX, in order to lead the poor and lower-middle peasants of Peach Garden into the capitalist quagmire, vigorously promoted the bourgeois philosophy of life of "suffering a small loss for a big gain," "farming for survival, for life," and "promotion and wealth." They vigorously spread the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies of "material incentives" and "work points as the commander." Wang XX said: "Without adding money, production enthusiasm is not enough, and you won't produce well for me," "Give more work points, and he will work hard," attempting to induce community members to struggle for personal interests. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and community members, armed with Chairman Mao's "Three Articles," fiercely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies spread by the Chinese Khrushchev and his wife Wang XX, and thoroughly uprooted the poisonous root of the bourgeois "self." They said: The Chinese Khrushchev and his wife are trying to make us poor and lower-middle peasants forget class struggle, forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, forget socialism and communism, and make capitalism revive through "self." We must not fall for their tricks.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly smashed the bourgeois "self" and firmly established the proletarian "public." A revolution erupted in their souls, and their spiritual outlook underwent a new leap. They abolished the reward system and voluntarily worked for the revolution and farmed for the revolution. Many poor and lower-middle peasants and community members worked day and night during busy farming seasons, with their working hours almost doubling compared to usual, but no one asked for increased work points. They said: "We poor and lower-middle peasants are not as money-loving as the Chinese Khrushchev and his wife Wang XX. We work for the revolution. We think of supporting the world revolution." The phenomenon of teams quarreling over land boundaries and not being united has disappeared. Considering the overall situation and recognizing the big picture, following the socialist bright path indicated by Chairman Mao has become the common goal of everyone's struggle. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants deeply felt: The bourgeois "self" is the root of revisionism. If "self" is not overthrown, the homeland is difficult to protect. Selflessness is the right path for us poor and lower-middle peasants!

"Listen to Chairman Mao's Words, Follow the Path of Dazhai, and Struggle to Build a Socialist New Countryside!"

"Learn from Dazhai in Agriculture" is the great call of our great leader Chairman Mao. The Chinese Khrushchev and his wife Wang XX, however, opposed Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and Chairman Mao's great instructions, obstructing the Peach Garden Brigade from learning from Dazhai. They spread a counter-revolutionary economism black wind, forcing the province, special district, and county to "meet needs, supply on time, and prioritize Peach Garden" in material supply. From the time Wang XX went to Peach Garden for the so-called "Four Cleanups" to 1966, a total of 640,000 yuan was allocated to Peach Garden for water conservancy and other uses, and 150,000 jin of chemical fertilizer was "cared for." As a result, the good tradition of self-reliance and hard work of the Peach Garden Brigade was seriously damaged, and the grain yield not only did not increase but also decreased year by year. During and after the "Four Cleanups," the state procurement task was not completed for two years.

"The 'Sixteen Points' point out: 'The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is aimed at making people's ideology revolutionary, so that all work can be done better, faster, and more efficiently.' The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in the Peach Garden Brigade, based on the spirit of the 'Sixteen Points,' criticized the Chinese Khrushchev's promotion of material incentives, opposition to learning from Dazhai, and attempt to restore capitalism. They vigorously promoted proletarian politics, learned from the revolutionary spirit of the people of Dazhai, and further carried forward the revolutionary tradition of self-reliance and hard work. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and community members, with their eyes on the countryside and their hearts on the world, launched one production peak after another, effectively promoting the development of agricultural production. Last year, the Peach Garden Brigade did not ask the state for a single cent or a single jin of chemical fertilizer, but the grain yield increased by more than 160,000 jin compared to 1966, exceeding the state procurement task. This year, they continue to grasp the revolution and promote production, and all crops are growing well, with a bumper harvest in sight. The poor and lower-middle peasants proudly said: This is the great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the great achievement of responding to Chairman Mao's great call to "learn from Dazhai in agriculture" and "grasp the revolution and promote production," and the realization of the revolutionization of people's ideology. We poor and lower-middle peasants of Peach Garden will listen to Chairman Mao's words for life, follow the path of Dazhai, and strive to build a socialist new countryside!

　　紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署　同中国赫鲁晓夫进行坚决斗争
　　桃园大队发生了天翻地覆的变化
    新华社石家庄九日电  曾经被中国赫鲁晓夫作为复辟资本主义试验场的河北省抚宁县卢王庄公社桃园大队，广大贫下中农和革命干部在伟大领袖毛主席《炮打司令部》的大字报鼓舞下，在毛主席亲自主持制定的《中国共产党中央委员会关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》的指引下，紧跟以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的伟大战略部署，两年来同中国赫鲁晓夫和他的老婆王××以及他们在桃园大队的代理人作了针锋相对的斗争，彻底粉碎了他们妄图复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋，使战无不胜的毛泽东思想和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线更加深入人心，无产阶级政权更加巩固，整个大队发生了天翻地覆的巨大变化。桃园大队的贫下中农每当谈起无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势时，都无比激动地说：爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲，是毛主席使我们桃园重见天日，毛主席是我们心中永远不落的红太阳。
    “十六条”送来了毛主席的声音
    两年前，毛主席的《炮打司令部》的大字报和毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”，象一声春雷，震撼着全中国，鼓舞着亿万革命人民向以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部发起猛烈进攻。桃园大队的广大贫下中农和革命干部听到这个消息，高兴得热泪直流。可是，中国赫鲁晓夫的老婆王××留在桃园的所谓“巩固组”和中国赫鲁晓夫在桃园的代理人关景东之流，对毛主席的大字报和“十六条”怕得要死，他们把登载“十六条”的报纸收藏起来，不让和群众见面，同时进一步加紧执行中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线，把许多贫下中农打成“反革命”和“走资本主义道路的牛鬼蛇神”。但是，乌云遮不住太阳。贫下中农找来了登载“十六条”的报纸，连夜复写许多份，分发给各户进行学习。广大贫下中农兴奋地说：“十六条”送来了毛主席的声音！他们用“十六条”作武器，对照分析桃园大队的形势，进一步认清了中国赫鲁晓夫、他的老婆王××以及关景东的反动本质，于是从资产阶级反动路线的白色恐怖下勇敢地冲杀出来，响亮地喊出了“打倒中国赫鲁晓夫！”“打倒王××！”“打倒关景东！”的口号，胜利地召开了斗争关景东的大会，把大队的领导权从中国赫鲁晓夫的代理人关景东之流的手里夺回到无产阶级和贫下中农手中。接着，全大队的贫下中农又和附近各县市无产阶级革命派、革命群众和外地来串连的红卫兵小将一起，召开万人大会，控诉、揭发中国赫鲁晓夫的形“左”实右的资产阶级反动路线对桃园的祸害，并为被中国赫鲁晓夫和王××打成“坏分子”的原桃园大队党支部书记吴臣、副书记赵树椿等同志平了反。从此，桃园形势大变，广大贫下中农和革命干部高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，按照毛主席指示的方向，向中国赫鲁晓夫和他的老婆王××以及他们在桃园大队的代理人展开大控诉、大揭发、大批判、大斗争，全大队的无产阶级文化大革命的洪流滚滚向前。
    “救命恩人毛主席，一分一秒不能离！”
    广大贫下中农愤怒地揭发，中国赫鲁晓夫的老婆王××一九六三年到一九六四年在桃园搞所谓“四清蹲点”时，一直不提我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，闭口不谈毛主席对中国革命和世界革命的伟大贡献，千方百计阻挠广大贫下中农学习毛主席著作；相反，却不放过一切机会，大肆吹捧中国赫鲁晓夫，无论大会小会，她开口就是“××（指中国赫鲁晓夫）指示”，“××派我来的”，她还大力贩卖黑《修养》，妄图腐蚀贫下中农。广大贫下中农在揭发、批判中坚定地说：“毛主席是我们最亲最亲的救命恩人。中国赫鲁晓夫和他的臭老婆越是反对毛主席，我们越要无限忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛主席，革命一辈子，忠于毛主席一辈子。”他们愤怒地从墙上撕下被中国赫鲁晓夫的代理人强迫着贴上去的中国赫鲁晓夫的像，端端正正地挂上最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的像，贴上毛主席语录，并且如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作。现在，这个大队在驻军毛泽东思想宣传队帮助下，贫下中农和革命社员家家办起了毛泽东思想学习班，人人有《毛主席语录》，户户有《毛泽东选集》。大学、大背、大讲、大用“老三篇”，活学活用毛主席的一系列最新指示，已经成为广大贫下中农和社员群众生活的第一需要。他们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的深厚无产阶级感情说：“救命恩人毛主席，一分一秒不能离；时刻想着毛主席，浑身上下有力气。”
    “把中国赫鲁晓夫彻底批倒批臭，才能保住社会主义江山！”
    中国赫鲁晓夫派他的老婆王××在桃园以搞“四清”为名，大搞资本主义复辟，精心炮制了臭名昭著的反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的大毒草“桃园经验”。王××拿着这个黑“经验”曾在北京、天津等地到处吹嘘放毒，以后又由中国赫鲁晓夫盗用中央名义，把这个黑“经验”散发到全国。但是，中国赫鲁晓夫和他的老婆王××以及他们的代理人，却作贼心虚，一直不敢让桃园的贫下中农知道有这样一个黑文件。在无产阶级文化大革命中，桃园的贫下中农看到了所谓“桃园经验”这个黑文件以后，人人义愤填膺。原来，中国赫鲁晓夫和他的老婆王××出于他们妄图复辟资本主义的狼子野心，在这个黑文件中，除了大肆鼓吹形“左”实右的资产阶级反动路线和贩卖反革命修正主义黑货以外，还颠倒黑白，无中生有，对桃园大队的贫下中农和革命干部大肆攻击和诬蔑。其中，颠倒黑白、捏造罪证、歪曲事实、不符合桃园真实情况的地方，就有一百七十多处。桃园大队的广大贫下中农极端愤怒地说：中国赫鲁晓夫和他的臭老婆简直是坏透了，他们如此颠倒黑白，诬蔑我们贫下中农，我们一定要和他们彻底算账！广大贫下中农以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，摆事实，讲道理，对这个黑“经验”逐条予以批判。两年多来，他们共召开各种批判会一千五百多次，写大字报两万多张，把反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的大毒草“桃园经验”和中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论、“四大自由”、“三自一包”等反革命修正主义黑货，批得体无完肤，臭不可闻。广大贫下中农说：饭可以不吃，觉可以不睡，中国赫鲁晓夫不能不批。只有把中国赫鲁晓夫彻底批倒批臭，毛泽东思想的根子才能扎得牢，才能保住社会主义江山！
    “大公无私，是咱贫下中农的正道！”
    我们伟大领袖毛主席发出“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召，说到了桃园广大贫下中农的心坎里。大队、生产队和社员家庭相继举办了毛泽东思想学习班，经常举行活学活用毛主席著作的斗私批修讲用会，人人努力改造世界观。
    中国赫鲁晓夫和他的老婆王××，为了把桃园贫下中农引向资本主义的泥坑，大肆宣扬“吃小亏占大便宜”、“种田为活命，一生一世为吃穿”和“升官发财”的资产阶级人生哲学；极力散布“物质刺激”、“工分挂帅”等反革命修正主义谬论。王××胡说什么：
  “不加点钱，生产积极性不够，不好好给你生产”，“多给工分，他就爱干”，妄图引诱社员为个人利益而奋斗。广大贫下中农和社员群众，以毛主席的“老三篇”为武器，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫和他的老婆王××散布的这一套反革命修正主义谬论，狠挖资产阶级“私”字这条毒根。他们说：中国赫鲁晓夫和他老婆给我们灌输资产阶级这一套，目的就是想使我们贫下中农忘记阶级斗争，忘记无产阶级专政，忘记社会主义和共产主义，使资本主义借“私”还魂，我们一定不能上他们的当。
    广大贫下中农和革命干部以毛泽东思想为武器，大破资产阶级的“私”字，大立无产阶级的“公”字，在灵魂深处爆发革命，精神面貌出现了新的飞跃。他们取消了奖励制度，自觉地为革命劳动，为革命种田。许多贫下中农和社员群众，在农忙时不分白天黑夜地干活，劳动时间几乎比平时增加一倍，但是没有一个人要求增加工分。他们说：“我们贫下中农绝不象中国赫鲁晓夫和他老婆王××那样财迷，我们是为革命干活，我们想的是支援世界革命。”过去队与队之间互相“争地边”、闹不团结的现象，现在看不到了，顾大局，识大体，走毛主席指引的社会主义光明大道，成了大家共同奋斗的方向。广大贫下中农深有体会地说：“资产阶级的‘私’字是修正主义的根子。‘私’字不倒，江山难保，大公无私，才是咱贫下中农的正道！”
    “听毛主席的话，走大寨的路，为建设社会主义新农村而奋斗！”
    “农业学大寨”，是我们伟大领袖毛主席发出的伟大号召，中国赫鲁晓夫和他的老婆王××却对抗毛主席的革命路线，对抗毛主席的伟大指示，阻挠桃园大队学大寨。他们大刮反革命经济主义黑风，强迫省、专区、县在物资供应上要“满足需要，及时供应，优先桃园”。从王××到桃园大队搞所谓“四清蹲点”起，直到一九六六年，共向桃园调拨供修水利等使用的资金六十四万元，“照顾”化肥十五万多斤，结果，严重地破坏了桃园大队自力更生、艰苦奋斗的好传统，桃园大队的粮食不仅没有增产，而且产量逐年下降，“四清”中和“四清”后两年，都没有完成国家的征购任务。
      “十六条”指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，就是为的要使人的思想革命化，因而使各项工作做得更多、更快、更好、更省。”桃园大队广大贫下中农根据“十六条”的精神，批判了中国赫鲁晓夫大搞物质刺激，反对学习大寨，企图复辟资本主义的罪行，大力突出无产阶级政治，学习大寨人的革命精神，进一步发扬自力更生、艰苦奋斗的革命传统。广大贫下中农和社员群众在毛泽东思想的指引下，身在田间，眼望全国，胸怀全球，掀起了一个又一个生产高潮，有力地促进了农业生产的发展。去年，桃园大队没有伸手向国家要一分钱、一斤化肥，粮食产量却比一九六六年增加了十六万多斤，超额完成了国家征购任务。今年，他们继续狠抓革命，猛促生产，各种作物长势一片良好，丰收在望。贫下中农无比自豪地说：这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是响应毛主席“农业学大寨”，“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，实现人的思想革命化的伟大成果。我们桃园贫下中农要一辈子听毛主席的话，走大寨的路，为建设社会主义新农村而奋斗！
