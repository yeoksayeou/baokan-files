Members of the Red Stone Gate Production Brigade in Beijing's Pinggu County always remember the support of their comrades-in-arms, the People's Liberation Army. Before starting work, they often gather with the PLA representatives who are helping with agricultural work in front of the "Support the Army, Love the People Dike" to study the works of Chairman Mao.  Photo by Xinhua News Agency reporter.
