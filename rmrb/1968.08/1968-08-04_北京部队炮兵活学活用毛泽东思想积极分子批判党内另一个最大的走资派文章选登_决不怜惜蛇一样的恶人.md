The people's war to clean up the class ranks has begun. A small clique of class enemies, in order to preserve themselves, put on a pitiful act in dark corners, spreading the idea that traitors, spies, and unrepentant capitalist roaders are people who have made a temporary mistake and deserve pity and sympathy. This is the same old tune sung by the other major capitalist roader within the party twenty-some years ago, advocating for pity and sympathy towards spy elements. It is a complete revolutionary fallacy.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "There is no such thing in the world as love without reason, nor is there such a thing as hatred without reason." In class society, "pity" and "sympathy" are class-based. The history of class struggle tells us that the struggle between opposing classes is a life-and-death struggle. There is no room for "pity" and "sympathy" here. Landlords and capitalists will never "pity" and "sympathize" with peasants and workers, and thus reduce their exploitation and oppression. Unrepentant capitalist roaders, traitors, spies, and other counter-revolutionary elements will never "pity" and "sympathize" with the proletarian revolutionaries and the broad masses of revolutionaries, and thus relax their oppression and slaughter. The reverse is also true. We can only implement revolutionary dictatorship on class enemies, allowing them to behave properly and not allowing them to cause trouble.

The practice of our country's revolutionary struggle and the two-year practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution tell us that class enemies are very cunning. When they are blinded by self-interest and misjudge the situation, they become aggressive, brandishing knives and swords, and slaughtering the people. When they are surrounded by revolutionary masses and in an unfavorable situation, in order to protect their current existence and future development, they try to act harmless and pitiful, seeking to survive and revive. The enemy's "begging for mercy" is not surrender, but a tactic to sharpen their weapons in secret, observe the direction, and seek to succeed. The enemy's pitiful appearance is their counter-revolutionary two-faced tactic. We must see through their strategies and defeat them. "We must not be naive and oversimplify the complex class struggle." "If we lose our vigilance, we will be greatly deceived and suffer greatly."

Mercy towards the enemy is cruelty towards the people. Pitying and sympathizing with the Kuomintang reactionaries will only lead to their return. Pitying and sympathizing with unrepentant capitalist roaders, traitors, spies, and all counter-revolutionary elements will lead to the loss of proletarian power, the beheading of millions of people, and the restoration of capitalism in China.

"Confess and you will be lenient, resist and you will be stern." In the face of the people's power, if spies, traitors, unrepentant capitalist roaders, and other counter-revolutionary elements honestly confess their crimes and truly repent, then we will still give them a way out. But this is not pitying and sympathizing with the enemy, nor is it about preserving counter-revolutionary forces as treasures. It is to split and disintegrate the enemy, to more quickly and thoroughly eliminate counter-revolutionary forces.

A small clique of spies, traitors, unrepentant capitalist roaders, and untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists are snake-like villains. In the brilliant work "Carry the Revolution Through to the End," the great leader Chairman Mao repeatedly warns us: "The Chinese people will not pity snake-like villains." He also points out that anyone who sings about pitying such villains is not a friend of the Chinese people. The other major capitalist roader within the party calls for us to pity and sympathize with spies and other class enemies, proving that he is a genuine Kuomintang agent who has infiltrated our party.

We must heighten our revolutionary vigilance, constantly analyze the new moves of class enemies, see through the counter-revolutionary strategies of class enemies, and drag out all the big snakes, small snakes, black snakes, white snakes, snakes baring their fangs, and snakes disguised as beautiful women from the gutters. We must fight and expose the enemies thoroughly, without mercy or leniency, and seize complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

　　北京部队炮兵活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子批判党内另一个最大的走资派文章选登
　　决不怜惜蛇一样的恶人
　　某部副政委　郭建都
    清理阶级队伍的人民战争打响了。一小撮阶级敌人为了保存自己，装出一副很可怜的样子，在阴暗的角落里散布一种论调，说什么特务、叛徒、顽固不化的走资派，是一时失足，值得怜惜和同情。这是党内另一个最大的走资派二十几年前鼓吹的对特务分子“应该寄予怜惜和同情心”的老调新唱，是十足的反革命谬论。
    毛主席教导我们：“世上决没有无缘无故的爱，也没有无缘无故的恨。”在阶级社会里，“怜惜”和“同情心”是有阶级性的。阶级斗争的历史告诉我们，敌对阶级之间的斗争，是你死我活的斗争。这里，根本不存在什么“怜惜”和“同情”。地主、资本家决不会“怜惜”和“同情”农民、工人，而减轻对他们的剥削和压迫。死不改悔的走资派、叛徒、特务和其他反革命分子也决不会“怜惜”和“同情”无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，而放松对他们的镇压和屠杀。反过来也是一样，我们对阶级敌人只能实行革命的专政，只许他们老老实实，不许他们乱说乱动。
    我国人民革命斗争的实践和两年来无产阶级文化大革命斗争的实践告诉了我们，阶级敌人是非常狡猾的。当他们利令智昏，错误估计了形势的时候，他们就气势汹汹，挥刀舞剑，向人民大砍大杀。当他们受到革命群众重重包围，处在不利情况的时候，为了保护他们现在的生存以利将来的发展，他们又竭力装着无害而可怜的样子，在忍受中求得重生。敌人的
  “乞怜”，并不是投降，而是为了便于暗中磨剑，窥测方向，以求一逞。敌人的可怜相，是他们施展的反革命两面派手法。我们必须识破他们的策略，战胜他们，“切不可书生气十足，把复杂的阶级斗争看得太简单了。”“如果我们丧失警惕性，那就会上大当，吃大亏。”
    对敌人的仁慈，就是对人民的残忍。怜惜和同情国民党反动派，国民党反动派就会卷土重来。怜惜和同情死不改悔的走资派、叛徒、特务和一切反革命分子，无产阶级政权就要丧失，千百万人头就要落地，资本主义就要在中国复辟。
      “坦白从宽，抗拒从严”。在人民的力量面前，特务、叛徒、顽固不化的走资派和其他反革命分子，如果老老实实地交代自己的罪行，真正向人民低头认罪的话，那我们还是给他们以出路的。但这决不是怜惜和同情敌人，不是为了把反革命势力当作宝贝保存起来，而是为了分化瓦解敌人，为了更迅速、更彻底地消灭反革命势力。
    一小撮特务、叛徒、顽固不化的走资派和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，是蛇一样的恶人。在《将革命进行到底》这篇光辉的著作中，伟大领袖毛主席一再告诫我们：“中国人民决不怜惜蛇一样的恶人”。他老人家还指出，凡是耍着花腔，说什么要怜惜一下这类恶人的人，决不是中国人民的朋友。党内另一个最大的走资派叫嚷要我们怜惜和同情特务这一类阶级敌人，证明了他是一个地地道道的混进我们党内的国民党代理人。
    我们一定要提高革命的警惕，时时分析阶级敌人的新动向，识破阶级敌人的反革命策略，把一切大蛇，小蛇，黑蛇，白蛇，露出毒牙的蛇和化成美女的蛇，统统从阴沟里揪出来，把敌人斗倒斗臭，批深批透，毫不留情，绝不手软，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
