Chairman Mao teaches us: "The attitude of Communist Party members towards backward people is not to look down upon them or despise them, but to be close to them, unite with them, persuade them, and encourage them to move forward."

Ten years ago, I came to work at Beijing Station. Under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, I joined the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China.

After joining the Party, I was so happy! I was willing to do any job. Later, due to relaxing my ideological transformation, I gradually developed a sense of superiority. I thought that since I came from a good family, grew up under the red flag, and became a Party member, I was superior to the surrounding masses. Look, I know some policies and spirits before you do, and some places you can't go, I can. Over the years, not only did I not become a student of the masses, but I felt that in everything I was more capable than the masses. I should be the teacher of the masses.

However, in reality, such a "teacher" is not welcomed by the masses. Although I work with the masses every day and I really want to do a good job, the masses do not tell me their true feelings. In a word, the relationship between this Party member and the masses is not close.

Recently, our Beijing Station held a rectification study class and invited the masses to participate. Party members and the masses sat together to study Chairman Mao's proletarian party line and criticize the revisionist party line of the Chinese Khrushchev. In the study class, the broad masses, with their boundless love for the Communist Party and their boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, criticized and made suggestions to the Party members.

After listening to these heartfelt criticisms and suggestions, I deeply felt the great wisdom of Chairman Mao's instructions. Chairman Mao teaches us:

"Only by being a student of the masses can one be a teacher of the masses. If one regards oneself as the master of the masses and as a nobleman standing above the 'inferior people,' then, no matter how great one's abilities are, one is not needed by the masses, and one's work has no future." By comparing myself with Chairman Mao's wise teachings, I deeply understand that in the past, my relationship with the surrounding masses was not good because I did not act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, but rather fell for the tricks of the Chinese Khrushchev. The Chinese Khrushchev wants Party members to regard themselves as "enlightened ones" and the masses as "unenlightened ones." This is the poison he spreads to separate the Party from the masses. I, in the past, unintentionally regarded the surrounding masses as "backward" and myself as "advanced," regarding myself as an "enlightened one," which was exactly falling for the poison of the Chinese Khrushchev. The profound education of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has made me recognize the fundamental difference between the two lines within the Party and recognize the ugly face of the Chinese Khrushchev.

In this rectification study class, I opened my heart to the masses, and the masses also opened their hearts to me. I now deeply feel that Communist Party members living among the masses are like fish living in water. The masses are the source of strength for all our work. I will definitely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, always be a student of the masses, be a friend of the masses, and never be a superior of the masses.

### 毛主席教导我们：“共产党员对于落后的人们的态度，不是轻视他们，看不起他们，而是亲近他们，团结他们，说服他们，鼓励他们前进。”　　鱼儿离不开水

    毛主席教导我们：“共产党员对于落后的人们的态度，不是轻视他们，看不起他们，而是亲近他们，团结他们，说服他们，鼓励他们前进。”

    十年前，我来到北京站工作。在毛泽东思想的哺育下，参加了伟大、光荣、正确的中国共产党。
    入了党，我这个高兴哪！什么工作都干得很欢。以后，由于放松了思想改造，逐渐滋长了优越感。认为自己出身好，在红旗下长大，又成了党员，就觉得比周围的群众高一等。瞧，有些政策精神我比你们先知道，有些会你们不能去我能去……。几年下来，别说当群众的学生，事事都觉得自己比群众高明些，我该是群众的先生了。
    但是事实上，这样的“先生”群众是不欢迎的。尽管每天同群众在一起，尽管我也满心想把工作做好，但是群众却不把心里话讲给我听。一句话，我这个党员和群众的关系并不亲密。
    最近，我们北京站办了整党学习班，邀请群众参加。党员和群众坐在一起学习毛主席的无产阶级建党路线，批判中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义建党路线。在学习班上，广大群众本着无限热爱共产党，无限忠于毛主席的心情，对党员提出了批评和建议。
    听了这些语重心长的批评和建议，我深深体会到毛主席指示的英明伟大。毛主席教导我们：
  “只有做群众的学生才能做群众的先生。如果把自己看作群众的主人，看作高踞于‘下等人’头上的贵族，那末，不管他们有多大的才能，也是群众所不需要的，他们的工作是没有前途的。”用毛主席的英明教导对照自己，我深深懂得，过去自己和周围的群众关系不够好，就是因为没有按照毛主席的指示办事，反而上了中国赫鲁晓夫的当。中国赫鲁晓夫要党员把自己看成是“先觉者”，把群众看成是
  “后觉者”，这是他为了离间党和群众的关系而散布的毒素。而我过去竟有意无意地认为周围的群众“落后”，认为自己“先进”，以“先觉者”自居，正是中了中国赫鲁晓夫的毒。触及灵魂的无产阶级文化大革命深深教育了我，使我认清了党内两条路线的根本区别，认清了中国赫鲁晓夫的丑恶嘴脸。
    在这次整党学习班上，我向群众交了心，群众也向我交了心。我现在深深体会到，共产党员生活在群众中就象鱼儿生活在水中一样，群众才是我们一切工作的力量源泉。我一定要按照毛主席的教导，永远做群众的学生，做群众的朋友，决不做群众的上司。
