The red sun shines over Sanduoba in Rujin County, Jiangxi Province, which was the temporary capital of the Chinese Soviet Republic during the Second Revolutionary Civil War. Our great leader Chairman Mao once lived here and led the national revolutionary movement. Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice has set a brilliant example for the people of Sanduoba.

The people of Sanduoba, with their glorious revolutionary tradition, established the Sanduoba People's Commune ten years ago under the great call of our great leader Chairman Mao to "establish people's communes." After ten years of construction, especially the tempering of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the past two years, the Sanduoba People's Commune has fully demonstrated its youthful vigor, and everywhere presents a lively and vibrant scene.

On this red land, the great thought of Mao Zedong has been widely propagated, people's class consciousness has been greatly enhanced, and their spiritual outlook has undergone profound changes.

Here, the commune was the first in the county to establish a revolutionary committee, and the revolutionary situation is excellent.

The commune's production and construction have made leapfrog developments in the past ten years, and the collective economy has been further strengthened and consolidated. The barren hills of ten years ago are now covered with forests, and the serious problem of soil erosion has been controlled. Due to the construction of a large number of reservoirs and ponds, the area of double-cropping rice fields has increased, coupled with the promotion of improved varieties and the transformation of low-yield fields, the yield of crops has increased several times. With the development of production, the living standards of the commune members have also improved significantly. More than half of the 2,500-plus poor and lower-middle peasant households in the commune have moved into new houses, and each team has grain reserves. Each brigade has water pumps and rice hulling machines, and this year the commune has bought a tractor with collective accumulation. The commune's cultural and health affairs have also developed significantly.

Under the guidance of the invincible thought of Mao Zedong and the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao, the Sanduoba People's Commune is striding forward on the broad road of socialism with giant steps.

Nurtured Under the Thought of Mao Zedong

Our great leader Chairman Mao wrote several brilliant works of great historical significance in Sanduoba, including "Care for the People's Livelihood, Pay Attention to Methods of Work," and personally dug the Red Well. Chairman Mao's brilliant revolutionary practice has nurtured the growth of the people of Sanduoba.

"Drinking water, never forget the well-digger; always think of Chairman Mao!" The people of Sanduoba have profound proletarian feelings for our great leader Chairman Mao. They love the great thought of Mao Zedong and are loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They are eager to study the works of Chairman Mao. However, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Jiangxi and Rujin were extremely afraid of the thought of Mao Zedong and did everything they could to obstruct and sabotage the people of Sanduoba in their active study and application of Chairman Mao's works. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the people of Sanduoba raised high the banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries" and fully exposed the heinous crimes of a handful of capitalist roaders and traitors who opposed the thought of Mao Zedong. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants declared that the more the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents opposed our active study and application of Chairman Mao's works, the more we must put active study and application of Chairman Mao's works in the first place in all our work. They remember the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching to "carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory" and are determined to make Sanduoba, this old revolutionary base, into a bright red school of Mao Zedong thought.

Now, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Sanduoba Commune make reading Chairman Mao's books the most important thing in their daily lives. They say, "The water from the Red Well is sweeter the more you drink, and Chairman Mao's books are more beloved the more you read." Every poor and lower-middle peasant household hangs up portraits of Chairman Mao and quotations from Chairman Mao, and every door has a couplet reading "Carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory." Everyone has a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and the "Three Constantly Read Articles," and wears a shining Mao badge. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants sing with boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao:

Drink a cup of Red Well water,
A red sun rises in the heart.
Generation after generation follows Chairman Mao,
With red hearts and loyalty, we do revolution!

Seventy-eight-year-old poor peasant Liu Juixiu paid close attention to state affairs during the Cultural Revolution. When the brigade set up a Mao Zedong thought study class, she was the first to sign up. Some people, seeing that she was old and had poor eyesight, advised her not to go, but she replied, "Chairman Mao is our poor peasants' great savior, and the thought of Mao Zedong is our poor peasants' lifeline. Reading Chairman Mao's books, no difficulty can stop me!"

After the establishment of the Sanduoba Commune Revolutionary Committee, the committee members, taking Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice of deeply involving himself with the masses, conducting investigations, participating in labor, and caring for the people's hardships in Sanduoba as a brilliant example, decided to inherit the glorious revolutionary tradition and be good servants of the people. In a few months, the commune and brigade cadres led the masses to dig more than eighty wells, providing the broad masses of commune members with clean and sweet well water, greatly improving the sanitary conditions in the countryside.

Chairman Mao teaches us, "A change in world outlook is a fundamental change." In Sanduoba Commune, the broad masses of cadres and the people study and apply the "Three Constantly Read Articles" extensively, and cultivate the lofty images of Zhang Zedong, Norman Bethune, and the Old Fool. They strive to revolutionize people's ideology. Cadres take the lead in criticizing themselves, seizing power for the revolution, and using the standard of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people to demand of themselves; commune members voluntarily criticize themselves, establishing the ideology of farming for the revolution, and collective spirit is greatly promoted. In June, the Sanduoba Brigade overcame a once-in-a-century great flood. In the struggle to restore production, the entire brigade had more than a hundred mu of fields that needed to be replanted with sweet potatoes, but there was a shortage of sweet potato seedlings. Many brigade cadres took the lead in cutting down sweet potato vines from their private plots and handing them over to the brigade, and the commune members responded enthusiastically, quickly planting all the fields that needed to be replanted. Similar incidents of wholeheartedly serving the collective can be seen everywhere.

Revolutionary Criticism Strengthens the Socialist Stronghold in the Countryside

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and commune members in Sanduoba Commune, through the in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism carried out during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, smashed the evil plot of the Chinese Khrushchev to restore capitalism in the countryside, fully aroused the enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants to follow the socialist road, and consolidated the socialist stronghold in the countryside.

The growth and development of Sanduoba Commune have been filled with fierce struggles between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines. A handful of class enemies harbor deep hatred for the people's commune, this new thing of socialism, and they fiercely attack the people's communes, dreaming of restoring their lost paradise. During the Cultural Revolution, a handful of class enemies attempted to fish in troubled waters and launch a counterattack.

"False is false, and disguise should be stripped away." Armed with the thought of Mao Zedong, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Sanduoba, in this great political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong thought, seized class struggle, and launched a fierce attack on a handful of class enemies, defeating them thoroughly. The commune, brigade, and production teams universally set up Mao Zedong thought study classes with revolutionary criticism as their content, organizing the broad masses of commune members to study and implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions; they held exhibitions of class struggle, and carried out activities of recalling the past and comparing the present with the past, and recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness.

Now, in the fields, courtyards, and commune members' homes, revolutionary criticism battlefields are set up everywhere. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and commune members denounce in writing and speech the reactionary revisionist fallacies spread by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the locality, such as "exploitation is meritorious," "three autonomies and one contract," "four freedoms," "work points in command," and "material incentives." Jinxing Brigade, Zaotian Production Team poor peasant Yang Yankang, in the old society at the age of five lost his father and grew up begging with a blind uncle. When he recounts the bitterness of the old society, he is filled with indignation: "In the old society, there was no place for us poor people to stand. The Chinese Khrushchev talks about 'exploitation is meritorious,' 'merit' where? 'Merit' in harming us poor and lower-middle peasants. The Chinese Khrushchev wants to restore capitalism and return to the old society, we will never agree!" He doesn't know many characters, but he wrote more than ten big-character posters himself, exposing the evil activities of the class enemies. Many old poor peasants in Sanduoba, in criticism meetings, display the begging bowls of the old society and patched, ragged clothes, denouncing the Chinese Khrushchev's fallacies of "exploitation is meritorious" and "class struggle is extinguished." They say, "We poor and lower-middle peasants of Sanduoba will never forget the bitter life of the old society. The Chinese Khrushchev talks about 'three autonomies and one contract' and 'four freedoms,' dreaming of restoring capitalism, we will resolutely overthrow him and make him never rise again!"

The in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism has greatly boosted the revolutionary spirit of the poor and lower-middle peasants, severely struck a handful of class enemies, and consolidated the socialist stronghold in the countryside. The broad masses of commune members, through revolutionary criticism, have an intense hatred for the reactionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev and an even deeper love for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The great leader Chairman Mao's brilliant thought that "only socialism can save China" has deeply entered the hearts of the people. In Sanduoba Third Team, there were four commune members who, influenced by the poison of the Chinese Khrushchev's reactionary revisionism, often went out to engage in individual sideline production. After the revolutionary criticism began, they voluntarily returned to the team to participate in collective production. They said, "In the past, we were deceived by the Chinese Khrushchev and walked the capitalist road to death. In the future, we will follow Chairman Mao's words and walk the socialist road."

Building the People's Commune Even More Beautifully

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" has deeply entered the hearts of the people of Sanduoba, further arousing the great creative power of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and commune members to "move mountains like Yu Gong and transform China," and strongly promoting the development of agricultural production. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and commune members are determined, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, to build the people's commune even more beautifully.

Sanduoba Commune is a hilly and mountainous area with very poor natural conditions. Before liberation, due to the serious destruction by the reactionary Kuomintang, all 78,000 mu of mountain land became barren hills, with serious soil erosion, drought, and poor soil quality, resulting in low yields. After liberation, especially after the establishment of the people's commune, the people of Sanduoba relied on collective power to build the Sanduoba Reservoir with a capacity of 570 million cubic meters, constructed a large number of ponds and small reservoirs, basically solving the problem of water conservancy irrigation, and most of the 78,000 mu of barren hills were planted with trees; at the same time, a large number of water and soil conservation projects were built, controlling the serious problem of soil erosion, and basically changing the local natural conditions. Agricultural production has been increasing year by year, and the entire commune has had six consecutive years of bumper harvests.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has washed away the filth of the exploiting classes, raising people's ideological awareness. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Sanduoba further carried forward the spirit of self-reliance and hard work, making agricultural production present a new look. Jinxing Brigade had more than 700 mu of fields that relied on small ponds for irrigation and could not withstand drought. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of commune members studied "Moving Mountains," and they said, "We will use what we have learned from Chairman Mao's works. Old Yu Gong could move mountains, can't we, with more than 200 households in the entire brigade, build a reservoir?" Then, the brigade organized the commune members to carry out activities to learn from Dazhai. The commune members decided to be self-reliant like the people of Dazhai and build the reservoir. This reservoir needed 40,000 cubic meters of earth and stone, but there was no funding, so each production team raised funds themselves; there were no technicians, so they designed and constructed it themselves, learning as they went. Everyone worked hard for two winters and springs, and finally, relying on their own hands, without a penny from the state, built a reservoir through self-reliance. Everyone said, "This reservoir was built with the wind of the Cultural Revolution, let's call it the 'East Wind Reservoir'!" This spring, during more than two months of severe drought, due to the "East Wind Reservoir," the entire brigade's early rice was transplanted on time and achieved a bumper harvest.

In front of Sanduoba Village, there is a row of red soil barren hills called "Dui Mian Gangzi," with more than ten small hills and an area of more than 1,000 mu, with serious soil erosion. The more than 1,000 mu of fields below the hills are threatened by mountain floods every year, with poor soil quality and low yields. After liberation, a few trees were planted on the mountain, but the survival rate was not high. Later, some fish-scale pits and flood-control ditches were dug, but most of them were washed away by the rain. During the Cultural Revolution, the poor and lower-middle peasants and commune members, through studying Chairman Mao's works, strengthened their confidence in treating the mountains. They said, "Sanduoba is where Chairman Mao lived. More than 30 years ago, Chairman Mao personally led us in treating the mountains and afforestation. We must not disappoint the great leader's expectations. No matter how great the difficulties, we must treat the mountains well." They summarized the experiences and lessons of the past few years, emphasized proletarian politics, improved technical measures, and after a winter and spring of hard work, finally tamed the barren "Dui Mian Gangzi," and the serious problem of soil erosion was conquered.

On the basis of achieving great results in treating the mountains and water, the commune members of Sanduoba further established the ambitious spirit of daring to think and daring to do, and marched towards new heights in agricultural production. Below Baota Mountain, there is a Songshan Nao Production Team, which was previously known as "Poor Mountain Head" due to barren land and low yields. In recent years, more than 20 returned educated youth have returned to the village. Through studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, they decided to do revolution in the countryside for life and change the face of their hometown. They transformed all 50-plus mu of cold slurry low-yield fields in the entire team and conducted various improved variety and fertilizer experiments, summarizing a set of technical measures for increasing production, and promoting them throughout the team, increasing the grain yield per mu from the previous 200-plus jin to 800-plus jin, changing the low-yield appearance.

    红太阳照耀着沙洲坝
    江西省瑞金县沙洲坝，是第二次国内革命战争时期中华苏维埃共和国临时中央政府所在地，我们的伟大领袖毛主席曾经住在这里领导过全国的革命运动。毛主席的伟大革命实践，给沙洲坝人民树立了光辉的榜样。
    富有光荣革命传统的沙洲坝人民，十年前，在伟大领袖毛主席“还是办人民公社好”的伟大号召的鼓舞下，在当地十二个高级农业生产合作社的基础上，成立了沙洲坝人民公社。经过十年的建设，特别是近两年多来无产阶级文化大革命的锻炼，沙洲坝人民公社充分显示出青春的活力，到处呈现着生气勃勃的动人景象。
    在这红色的土地上，伟大的毛泽东思想得到了空前大普及，人们的阶级觉悟空前提高，精神面貌发生了深刻的变化。
    这里，在全县第一个成立了公社革命委员会，革命形势空前大好。
    公社的生产建设十年来有了飞跃的发展，集体经济进一步壮大和巩固。十年前光秃秃的荒山，今天树木成林，严重的水土流失现象已经得到控制。由于兴修了大批水库、山塘，稻田复种面积增加，加上推广了良种，改造了低产田，农作物产量成倍增长。随着生产的发展，社员生活也有了很大的改善。全社二千五百多户贫下中农，半数以上都住上了新房，队队都有了储备粮。各大队都有了抽水机、碾米机，今年公社还以集体积累买了一部拖拉机。公社的文教卫生事业，也有了很大发展。
    沙洲坝人民公社，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，在毛主席无产阶级革命路线的指引下，正以巨人般的步伐，在社会主义康庄大道上大踏步前进。
    在毛泽东思想的哺育下成长
    伟大领袖毛主席曾在沙洲坝写下了具有伟大历史意义的《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》等四篇光辉著作，并且曾在这里亲自挖掘红井清泉。毛主席光辉的革命实践，哺育着沙洲坝人民的成长。
      “吃水不忘挖井人，时刻想念毛主席！”沙洲坝人民对伟大领袖毛主席有着无比深厚的无产阶级感情，他们无限热爱伟大的毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，迫切要求学习毛主席著作。可是，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在江西、瑞金的代理人极端害怕毛泽东思想，千方百计地阻挠和破坏沙洲坝人民活学活用毛主席著作。在无产阶级文化大革命中，沙洲坝人民高举“对反动派造反有理”的大旗，充分揭露了一小撮走资派和叛徒等阶级敌人反对毛泽东思想的滔天罪行。广大贫下中农表示，中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人越是反对我们活学活用毛主席著作，我们越是要把活学活用毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位。他们牢记伟大领袖毛主席“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”的教导，决心把沙洲坝这块红色的革命老根据地办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    现在，沙洲坝公社贫下中农每天生活中头等重要的大事，就是读毛主席的书。他们说：“红井的水越喝越甜，毛主席的书越读越爱读。”贫下中农家家挂起毛主席的像、毛主席语录，户户门口贴着“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”的对联，人人有《毛主席语录》和“老三篇”，胸前戴着金光闪闪的毛主席像章。广大贫下中农满怀对伟大领袖毛主席无限忠心，经常唱这样的山歌：“喝一杯红井水，心中升起红太阳。世代紧跟毛主席，赤胆忠心干革命！”
    七十八岁的贫农老婆婆刘菊秀，在文化大革命中，非常关心国家大事。队上办起毛泽东思想学习班，她争先报名参加。有的人看她年老眼花，劝她不要去，她回答说：“毛主席是我们贫下中农的大救星，毛泽东思想是我们贫下中农的命根子，读毛主席的书，什么困难也难我不倒！”
    沙洲坝人民公社革委会成立后，革委会成员以毛主席当年在沙洲坝深入群众，调查研究，参加劳动，关心群众疾苦的伟大革命实践为光辉榜样，决心继承光荣的革命传统，当好人民的勤务员。在几个月中，社队干部就领导群众打了八十多口水井，使广大社员喝上了洁净甘甜的井水，大大改善了农村的卫生条件。
    毛主席教导说：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。在沙洲坝公社，广大干部和群众大学大用“老三篇”，大树张思德、白求恩、老愚公三个光辉形象，狠抓人的思想革命化。干部带头斗私，为革命掌权，用“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的标准来要求自己；社员自觉斗私，树立起为革命种田的思想，集体主义精神大发扬。今年六月间，沙洲坝大队战胜了百年未有的特大洪水。在恢复生产的斗争中，全大队有一百多亩田要改种红薯，但是缺乏薯秧。许多生产队干部就带头割下自留地里的红薯藤交到队里，社员也纷纷响应，很快就把要改种的田全部种上。类似这种一心为集体的事，到处可见。革命大批判巩固了农村社会主义阵地
    沙洲坝人民公社广大贫下中农和社员群众，在无产阶级文化大革命中深入持久地开展的革命的大批判，粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫在农村复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋，充分激发了广大农民走社会主义道路的积极性，巩固了农村的社会主义阵地。
    沙洲坝人民公社的成长发展，充满着两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争。一小撮阶级敌人对人民公社这个社会主义的新生事物充满着仇恨，他们大肆攻击人民公社，梦想恢复他们已经失去了的天堂。在文化大革命中，一小撮阶级敌人妄图混水摸鱼，进行反攻倒算。
      “假的就是假的，伪装应当剥去。”用毛泽东思想武装起来的沙洲坝广大贫下中农在这场无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命中，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，狠抓阶级斗争，对一小撮阶级敌人展开了最猛烈的进攻，把他们打得落花流水。公社、大队、生产队还普遍开办了以革命大批判为内容的毛泽东思想学习班，组织广大社员学习和落实毛主席的一系列最新指示；举办阶级斗争事迹展览，开展回忆对比和忆苦思甜活动。
    现在，在田头、屋场，在社员家庭里，到处都摆开了革命大批判的战场。广大贫下中农和社员群众人人口诛笔伐，对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在当地的代理人散布的“剥削有功”、“三自一包”、“四大自由”、“工分挂帅”、“物质刺激”等反革命修正主义谬论猛烈开火。金星大队枣子排生产队贫农杨衍芳，旧社会时五岁死了父亲，跟着瞎子伯伯讨饭长大。他一诉起旧社会的苦，就激起满腔的怒火：“旧社会那有我们穷人的站脚地。中国赫鲁晓夫说什么‘剥削有功’，‘功’在那里？‘功’在害死我们贫下中农。中国赫鲁晓夫要复辟资本主义，回到旧社会，我们决不答应！”他不认识几个字，却自己动手一连写了十多张揭露阶级敌人罪恶活动的大字报。沙洲坝的许多老贫农，在批判会上摆出旧社会的讨饭碗，补钉落补钉的烂衣衫，控诉中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“剥削有功”、“阶级斗争熄灭”论的罪恶。他们说：“我们沙洲坝的贫下中农，永远也忘不了旧社会的苦难生活。中国赫鲁晓夫搞什么‘三自一包’‘四大自由’，妄想复辟资本主义，我们就要坚决打倒他，叫他永世不得翻身！”
    深入持久的革命大批判，大长了贫下中农的革命志气，沉重地打击了一小撮阶级敌人，巩固了农村的社会主义阵地。广大社员群众通过革命的大批判，对中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线无比痛恨，对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线更加热爱，伟大领袖毛主席“只有社会主义能够救中国”的光辉思想更加深入人心。沙洲坝三队有四名社员，以前受中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义流毒的影响，常常外出搞单干副业。开展革命大批判后，他们主动回队参加集体生产。他们说：“以前我们上了中国赫鲁晓夫的当，走的是资本主义死路。今后，我们要听毛主席的话，走社会主义大道。”
    把人民公社建设得更加美好
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针在沙洲坝深入人心，进一步激发了广大贫下中农和社员群众“愚公移山，改造中国”的伟大创造力，有力地促进了农业生产的发展。广大贫下中农和社员群众，决心在毛主席无产阶级革命路线的指引下，把人民公社建设得更加美好。
    沙洲坝公社是一个自然条件很差的丘陵山区。解放前由于国民党反动派的严重破坏，七万八千多亩山地全部成了光秃秃的荒山，水土严重流失，水源枯竭，常遭干旱的威胁，田地土质贫瘠，产量很低。解放后，特别是人民公社化后，沙洲坝人民依靠集体力量，修起了蓄水五百七十多万立方的沙洲水库，兴建了大批山塘和小水库，基本上解决了水利灌溉问题，七万八千亩荒山绝大部分种上了树；同时，兴修了大批水土保持工程，控制了严重的水土流失现象，基本上改变了当地的自然条件，农业生产连年上升，全社已连续六年丰收。
    无产阶级文化大革命，涤荡着剥削阶级的污泥浊水，提高了人的思想觉悟。沙洲坝贫下中农进一步发扬奋发图强，自力更生的精神，使农业生产出现了新的面貌。金星大队过去有七百多亩田靠小山塘灌溉，抗不了大旱。无产阶级文化大革命中，广大社员学习了《愚公移山》，他们说：“我们学了毛主席著作就要用，老愚公能移山，我们全大队二百多户还建不成一个水库吗？”接着，大队又组织社员开展学习大寨的活动。社员们决心象大寨人那样自力更生，把水库修起来。这座水库需要四万多土石方，没有资金，各生产队自己筹集；没有技术员，他们就自己设计、自己施工，边学边干。大家苦干两个冬春，终于靠自己的双手，不要国家一分钱，自力更生建成了一座水库。大家说：这座水库是靠文化大革命的东风建起来的，就叫它“东风水库”吧！今年春天两个多月大旱，由于有了“东风水库”，全队早稻适时插上了秧，并获得了大丰收。
    沙洲坝村前有一排红土荒山，叫“对面岗子”，有十多个小山头，面积有一千多亩，水土流失现象很严重。山下的一千多亩田，年年受山洪危害，土质瘠薄，产量很低。解放以后，在山上种了几次树，但成活率不高。后来，挖了一些鱼鳞坑、拦洪沟，一下雨，又大都冲掉了。在文化大革命中，贫下中农和社员群众通过学习毛主席著作，增强了治山的信心。他们说：
  “沙洲坝是毛主席住过的地方，三十多年前毛主席就亲自领导我们治山、造林，我们一定不辜负伟大领袖的希望，不管有天大的困难，也要把山治好。”他们总结了前几年的经验教训，突出了无产阶级政治，改进了技术措施，经过一个冬春的苦干，终于治服了光秃秃的“对面岗子”，严重的水土流失现象被征服了。
    在取得了治山治水巨大成绩的基础上，沙洲坝的社员们还进一步树立了敢想、敢干的雄心壮志，向农业生产的新高峰进军。白塔山下，有一个松山脑生产队，以前由于土地瘠薄，产量很低，因而被称为“穷山脑”。这几年，村里陆续回来二十多名知识青年，他们通过活学活用毛主席著作，决心在农村干一辈子革命，改变家乡的面貌。他们把全队五十多亩冷浆低产田全部改造过来，并进行了各种良种、肥料试验，总结出一套增产的技术措施，在全队推广，使全队的粮食亩产量由过去的二百多斤提高到八百多斤，改变了低产面貌。　新华社通讯员　新华社记者
