The so-called "Western culture" is the most reactionary, most decadent, and most ugly culture of imperialism. As the imperialist system heads towards total collapse, its culture, like a terminally ill patient, has become "sunset-bound and gasping for breath." However, after Khrushchev and his successors took power, they engaged in extensive "cultural cooperation" with the U.S. imperialists, opening the doors wide to "Western culture," allowing it to find a "new market" in the Soviet Union. Recently, amid the drumbeats of full-scale counter-revolutionary collusion between the Soviet Union and the United States, another black deal was sealed. This was the 1968-1969 Soviet-American Cultural Exchange Agreement signed in Moscow.

This "cultural agreement" covers everything from science and technology to literature, art, education, medicine, sports, and even the exchange of "artists," "experts," publications, exhibitions, and films—it is truly a motley assortment. Among these, the exchange of visiting "experts" alone involves more than twenty departments.

If, in 1958, the great traitor Khrushchev signed the first "cultural agreement" with the United States, it was merely a "breach" that had been opened. Ten years later, with the signing of the sixth "cultural agreement," the most reactionary, most decadent, and most ugly "Western culture" has, like a burst dam, flooded Lenin's homeland. The Soviet revisionist clique's wholesale "Westernization" has been praised by their masters. The U.S. imperialist leader Johnson recently boasted: "Sino-American cooperation has never been more fruitful than in this period."

Now let us take a look at the "fruits" of this period of Sino-American "cultural cooperation"!

It is under the banner of Sino-American "cultural cooperation" that not only has Soviet literature become increasingly decadent and corrupt, but also that the most reactionary and rotten American "literary" books have been mass-produced and published in the Soviet Union. The editor of the Soviet *Literary Gazette* admitted in a conversation: "The best-selling foreign books in the Soviet Union are American novels."

It is under the banner of Sino-American "cultural cooperation" that the lowbrow and vulgar Western music and dance, such as jazz, have been performed with even greater vigor on the Soviet stage! American dances like the twist, the waltz, and the rock 'n' roll have been performed with even greater frenzy! The Soviet revisionist clique not only lavishly invites large numbers of Western nightclub jazz bands to perform in various parts of the Soviet Union, spreading poison, but also sends people to participate in "international competitions," shamelessly learning from Western bands. Thus, American-style "Elvis Presley" bands and British-style "Beatles" bands have all taken the stage in the Soviet Union. The Soviet Central Television's fourth channel has been holding lectures on "Jazz Yesterday and Today" since December 12 last year, once a month. They fawningly praise American jazz as "true music," "sacred music," claiming that jazz enriches "understanding of the world." This year, they have also held "jazz music festivals" in seven cities, including Moscow, in an unprecedented effort to promote this vulgar music. The Soviet clique continues to stage large numbers of lowbrow American plays.

It is under the banner of Sino-American "cultural cooperation" that the Soviet screen has completely fallen into the hands of propagandists of "Western culture." The Soviet clique not only continues to shamelessly promote American films through various newspapers and magazines, publishing large numbers of books for reactionary American films, but also, since January this year, the Soviet Central Television has been slavishly introducing American film stars. In fact, the Soviet clique has already handed over a large part of the Soviet screen to Hollywood. The head of the Soviet Foreign Cultural Liaison Committee, Romanov, admitted: "There are often 'hundreds of copies of American films' touring our country." Even so, the Soviet clique is still not satisfied and has stipulated in the new cultural agreement that American films should be "distributed as widely as possible." Following the purchase of the American film *It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World* for $200,000, this year, films like *Lovers of New Orleans* have been widely shown in various cinemas in Moscow.

It is under the banner of Sino-American "cultural cooperation" that the Soviet clique has opened the door to the U.S. imperialists' anti-communist, anti-Chinese, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary tool, "The Voice of America." As former U.S. President Kennedy put it, the infamous "Voice of America" is "an arm of the U.S. government." Like flies to dung, the Soviet clique treats it as a treasure. Soon after the 20th Congress of the CPSU, the Soviet clique began to intermittently stop interfering with "The Voice of America's" broadcasts to the Soviet Union. Later, the Soviet Union and the United States reached an agreement to completely stop interfering with "The Voice of America" and to directly broadcast programs supplied by "The Voice of America." After Brezhnev and Kosygin took power, they opened the green light even wider for "The Voice of America." American newspapers proudly declared: The content, form, and techniques of Soviet radio and television programs have been "completely reorganized" according to Western radio and television.

The same is true for the Soviet television station. Recently, the Soviet clique, under the guise of "celebrating" the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution and "reviewing" the past half-century of Soviet history, carefully produced a television documentary *A Chronicle of Half a Century*. On the one hand, it fiercely attacks China, and on the other, it fawningly praises the so-called "Sino-American friendship," currying favor with their masters. They painstakingly collected many scenes of Sino-American "friendship," "cooperation," and Soviet and American people hugging and kissing. Even more shamelessly, they included the rise and death of the U.S. imperialist leader Kennedy as a "major event" in Soviet history in this "chronicle" and, in the commentary, praised Kennedy as "clear-sighted" and "realistic," expressing "deep sorrow" over his death.

It is also under the banner of Sino-American "cultural cooperation" that the decadent Western bourgeois lifestyle has infiltrated the Soviet Union through every crack. Recently, a so-called "Soviet Fashion Design Exhibition" was held in Washington. The exhibition featured the "masterpieces" designed by the Soviet "top-notch modern fashion experts," including some that mimicked Western skinny pants and miniskirts designed by the so-called "most famous avant-garde fashion designer in the Soviet Union" into what is called the "Space Age" outfit, "Reform" outfit, etc. The obvious "Westernization" of this exhibition was praised and cheered by the American masters, who exclaimed, "It is exhilarating." The Soviet clique even shamelessly brought the dog shows in New York and London to Moscow, where they became all the rage. It is truly decadent to the extreme.

To speed up the "Westernization" of the Soviet Union, the Soviet clique has become increasingly brazen in using "international tourism" to attract all sorts of "tourists" from the capitalist world of the West, allowing these people to spread the decadent Western lifestyle in Lenin's homeland. Recently, the Soviet clique announced the opening of more than a hundred cities in all fifteen republics to hundreds of thousands of foreign bourgeois gentlemen and ladies to seek pleasure in the Soviet Union. In addition, the Soviet clique, through various channels such as opening "nightclubs," giving away *American* magazines for free, holding American touring exhibitions, introducing American experiences, exchanging students, honoring scholars, holding literary gatherings, and reprinting American reactionary newspaper articles, has been engaging in extensive "cultural cooperation" with the U.S. imperialists, completely surrendering to the U.S. imperialists, and making the Soviet Union completely "Westernized."

All of these "achievements" fully illustrate that since last June, when the Soviet revisionists and the U.S. imperialist leaders had a secret talk in Glassboro, the counter-revolutionary collusion between the U.S. and the Soviet Union has indeed made astonishing progress, from the ground, under the sea, to the sky, from the "hotline" between the White House and the Kremlin to the opening of the direct flight route between New York and Moscow, from politics, economy, and military to culture.

The Soviet revisionist clique and the U.S. imperialists have indeed formed a genuine, all-around counter-revolutionary holy alliance.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the present world, all culture or literature and art belong to a certain class and a certain political line." Today, the Soviet revisionist clique's large-scale importation of "Western culture" is completely for the purpose of serving the full restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union, for the full counter-revolutionary collusion between the Soviet Union and the United States, in a word, for serving their counter-revolutionary revisionist political line. The so-called Sino-American "cultural cooperation," like Sino-American political, economic, and military cooperation, is a product of the Soviet revisionist clique's line of "peaceful coexistence" and is a great betrayal of the Soviet people and the people of the world.

Why is it that in this period, Sino-American "cultural cooperation" is so brazen and escalating? Recently, the American *Newsweek* bluntly admitted: "In the rapidly changing world of the 1960s, the two countries (referring to the Soviet revisionists and U.S. imperialists) often find that their domestic and international tensions are similar." What "domestic and international tensions" are these? It turns out that in this period, under the personal leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, China has successfully launched the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which has had a tremendous impact on the world, striking a powerful blow to imperialist-revisionists! Looking at the world, the radiant Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the path to liberation for the revolutionary people of the world. The victory reports from the Longshan Mountains, the war drums along the equator, the red flags under the Pupang Mountains, the roar of the Mississippi River, the revolutionary storms in Western Europe and North America... have all merged into an irresistible revolutionary torrent, which is rapidly breaching the dikes of the U.S.-Soviet counter-revolutionary global collusion. The political and economic crises of imperialism, led by the United States, have deepened dramatically and have become incurable. The modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist clique is increasingly disintegrating and is in a state of turmoil. Such a good revolutionary situation, for the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionist clique, is naturally a "tense situation," which is not surprising. It is precisely in such days that the Soviet revisionist clique and the U.S. imperialists, in order to prop up their shaky bourgeois dictatorship, have to rely on each other, using the decadent "Western culture" as a talisman, attempting to block the revolutionary torrent of the world and save their doomed fate.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out with great insight: "The Soviet Union is the first socialist country, and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is a party created by Lenin. Although the leadership of the party and the state in the Soviet Union has now been usurped by revisionists, I advise comrades to firmly believe that the vast majority of the Soviet people, party members, and cadres are good and want revolution. The rule of revisionism will not last long." It can be asserted that the Soviet people with a glorious revolutionary tradition will absolutely not allow the Soviet revisionist traitors to continue to ravage the Soviet Union in this way! No matter how the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionists act recklessly and arbitrarily, they will absolutely not be able to change the laws of historical development and block the victory of socialism in the Soviet Union and the world. The U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionists, along with their decadent "Western culture," will ultimately be buried by the Soviet people, the American people, and the revolutionary people of the world.

　　苏修贩卖西方反动文化的奴才相
　　红津达　南学林
    所谓“西方文化”，就是最反动、最腐朽、最丑恶的帝国主义文化。随着帝国主义制度走向全面崩溃，它的文化也象一个病入膏肓的垂死者一样，已经“日薄西山，气息奄奄”了。但是，赫鲁晓夫及其继承者上台以后，却同美帝大搞“文化合作”，向“西方文化”大开门户，使它在苏联找到了“新市场”。不久前，在苏美全面反革命勾结的密锣紧鼓声中，又一笔黑交易拍板成交。这就是在莫斯科签订的一九六八年——一九六九年苏美文化交流协定。
    这个“文化协定”，包罗万象。从科学、技术到文学、艺术、教育、医药、体育，还包括交换“艺术家”、“专家”、刊物、展览会和影片，真是五花八门。其中仅交换访问的“专家”就涉及到二十多个部门。
    如果说，一九五八年大叛徒赫鲁晓夫同美国签订第一个“文化协定”的时候，美国还只是“突破了一个决口”，那末，十年后签订第六个“文化协定”的今天，世界上最反动、最腐朽、最丑恶的“西方文化”，已经象决了口的污水一样，在列宁的故乡，大肆泛滥了起来。苏修叛徒集团大搞全盘“西方化”，得到了主子的夸奖。美帝头子约翰逊在最近发表的一段讲话中，洋洋自得地说：“苏美合作”没有那一个时期“比这个时期更有成果”。
    现在就让我们来看一下“这个时期”苏美“文化合作”的“成果”吧！
    正是在苏美“文化合作”的幌子下，不仅苏修自己的文学日益腐朽堕落，而且反动透顶、腐烂已极的美国“文学”书籍大量在苏联翻译出版。苏修《文学报》主编在一次谈话中供认：“苏联外国书籍市场上的畅销书是美国小说”。
    正是在苏美“文化合作”的幌子下，在苏修的音乐舞蹈戏剧舞台上，低级下流的西方靡靡之音——爵士音乐，演奏得更加起劲了！美国的阿飞舞、摇摆舞、扭摆舞等黄色舞蹈，跳得更加疯狂了！苏修叛徒集团不仅重金礼聘大量西方夜总会的爵士乐队到苏联各地放毒，而且还派人参加“国际比赛”，恬不知耻地向西方乐队“取经”。于是，什么美国式的“猫王”乐队，英国式的“甲壳虫”乐队，在苏联纷纷登场。苏修中央电视台第四套节目，从去年十二月十二日起连续举办“爵士乐的昨天与今天”的讲座，每月一讲。他们肉麻地吹捧美国的爵士乐是什么“真正的音乐”、“神圣的音乐”，说什么爵士乐丰富了“对世界的了解”。今年以来，还先后在莫斯科等七个城市举行了乌烟瘴气的“爵士音乐节”，空前起劲地推广这种下流的音乐。苏修集团还继续把低级庸俗的美国戏，大量地搬上戏剧舞台。
    正是在苏美“文化合作”的幌子下，苏修的银幕也已经完全堕落为宣扬“西方文化”的工具。苏修集团不仅继续肆无忌惮地通过各种报刊大肆吹捧美国影片，大量地为反动的美国电影出版书籍；而且，苏修中央电视台从今年一月以来，还奴颜婢膝地搞什么美国电影明星介绍。事实上苏修已将苏联银幕的很大部分的地盘拱送给了好莱坞。苏修对外文化联络委员会主任罗曼诺夫承认：经常有“几百部美国电影拷贝在我们国内巡回放映”。即使如此，苏修集团还嫌不足，在新成交的“文化协定”中，还明文规定，要“尽可能广泛地发行”美国影片。继用二十万美元巨款买来的那部美国片《这是疯狂、疯狂、疯狂、疯狂的世界》之后，今年以来，又有《新奥尔良的情人》等美国片，在莫斯科各影院大量上映。
    正是在苏美“文化合作”的幌子下，苏修集团为美帝反共反华反人民反革命的御用工具——“美国之音”敞开了大门。用美国前总统肯尼迪的话来说，臭名昭著的“美国之音”是美国政府的“一只臂膀”。象苍蝇见了狗屎一样，苏修集团却把它奉为至宝。早在苏共二十大后不久，苏修集团就开始断断续续地停止干扰“美国之音”的对苏广播。后来苏美又达成协议，干脆正式全面停止对“美国之音”的干扰，并且直接播送“美国之音”供应的节目。勃列日涅夫、柯西金上台以后，更是为“美国之音”大开绿灯。美国报刊曾得意洋洋地说：苏修的广播和电视节目，从内容、形式到技巧，都已按照西方广播电视来“进行彻底的改组”。
    广播电台如此，苏修的电视台也并不两样。不久前，苏修集团打着“庆祝”十月革命五十周年和“回顾”苏联过去半个世纪历史的招牌，精心炮制出来了一部电视纪录片《半个世纪的编年史》，一方面猖狂反华，一方面肉麻地宣扬所谓“苏美友谊”，讨主子的欢心。他们煞费苦心地搜罗了不少苏美“友好”、“合作”以及苏联人和美国人拥抱接吻等等的镜头。更有甚者，他们还恬不知耻地把美帝头子肯尼迪的上台和死亡作为苏联的“大事”，收入这部“编年史”，并在解说词中吹捧肯尼迪是什么“清醒的”、“现实的”，对他的死如丧考妣地“表示沉痛哀悼”。
    也正是在苏美“文化合作”的幌子下，腐朽的西方资产阶级生活方式，无孔不入地渗入苏联。不久前，在华盛顿举办了一个所谓“苏联时装设计展览会”。展览会上展出了苏修“顶呱呱的现代服装专家”所设计的
  “杰作”，其中有的是被称为“苏联最著名先锋派服装设计专家”模仿西方的瘦腿裤和超短裙而设计的什么
  “宇宙世纪”装、“革新”装等等。这次展览会所表现的明显的“西方化”，博得了美国主子的赞赏和喝采，大叫“令人振奋”。苏修甚至把在纽约和伦敦的狗展，也毫无顾忌地搬到莫斯科，居然风靡一时。真是腐朽到了极点。
    苏修集团为了加速苏联的“西方化”，还越来越露骨地利用“国际旅行事业”，大肆招徕西方资本主义世界形形色色的“游客”，任由这些人在列宁的故乡传播荒淫无耻的西方生活方式。最近，苏修还宣布开放全部十五个加盟共和国中的一百多个城市，供上百万外国资产阶级老爷太太们到苏联寻欢作乐。此外，苏修还通过开设“夜总会”，免费“赠送”《美国》杂志，举办美国巡回展览，介绍美国经验，互派留学生，表彰学者，举办笔会，转载美国反动报刊文章等等各种各样的渠道，与美帝大搞特搞“文化合作”，向美帝彻底投降，使苏联全盘“西方化”。
    凡此种种，不一而足。这些“成果”，充分地说明自从去年六月苏修和美帝头目在葛拉斯堡罗密谈以来，美苏的反革命勾结，从地上、海下到天空，从白宫—克里姆林宫的“热线联系”到纽约—莫斯科直达航线的开航，从政治、经济、军事到文化，的确又有了惊人的发展。苏修和美帝已经结成了地地道道的全面的反革命神圣同盟。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“在现在世界上，一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。”今天，苏修集团大规模地输入“西方文化”，完全是为在苏联全面复辟资本主义服务的，为苏美的全面反革命勾结服务的，一句话，是为他们的反革命修正主义的政治路线服务的。所谓苏美“文化合作”，同苏美政治经济军事合作一样，是苏修叛徒集团推行的“和平共处”的投降主义路线的产物，是对苏联人民和世界人民的大叛卖。
    为什么“这个时期”苏美如此肆无忌惮、变本加厉地进行“文化合作”呢？最近美国《新闻周刊》直言不讳地供认：“在六十年代的变化迅速的世界上，两国（指苏修与美帝）经常发现它们的国内外的紧张局面有许多是一样的。”什么“国内外的紧张局面”呢？原来，“这个时期”在我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自领导下，中国胜利开展了无产阶级文化大革命，在全世界产生了巨大的影响，有力地打击了帝修反！放眼世界，光芒四射的毛泽东思想，照亮了世界革命人民解放的道路。长山山麓的捷报，赤道线上的战鼓，普潘山下的红旗，密西西比河的怒吼，西欧、北美的革命风暴……汇成了一股不可抗拒的革命洪流，这洪流迅速地冲决着苏美反革命全球勾结的堤坝。以美国为首的帝国主义的政治危机和经济危机急剧加深，成了不治之症。以苏修集团为中心的现代修正主义日益分崩离析，陷在风雨飘摇之中。这样大好的革命形势，对美帝和苏修集团来说，自然是“紧张的局面”，这是毫不奇怪的。正是在这样的日子里，苏修集团和美帝为了支撑他们摇摇欲坠的资产阶级专政，不得不相依为命，用腐朽的“西方文化”作护身符，妄图阻挡世界革命的洪流，挽救他们灭亡的命运。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席英明地指出：“苏联是第一个社会主义国家，苏联共产党是列宁创造的党。虽然，苏联的党和国家的领导现在被修正主义者篡夺了，但是，我劝同志们坚决相信，苏联广大的人民、广大的党员和干部，是好的，是要革命的，修正主义的统治是不会长久的。”可以断言，具有光荣革命传统的苏联人民绝不能容忍苏修叛徒把苏联这样糟踏下去的！不管美帝和苏修怎样倒行逆施，肆意妄为，绝对改变不了历史发展的规律，阻挡不了社会主义在苏联和全世界的胜利。美帝和苏修连同它们当作宝贝的腐朽的“西方文化”，必将最终地被苏联人民、美国人民和全世界革命人民统统葬入坟墓。
