Under the leadership of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, the people of the newly liberated areas in South Vietnam are actively exercising their right to self-governance. While punishing criminals and establishing revolutionary governments, they are taking various measures to defend and build the liberated areas, making the recently liberated regions flourish.

	Eliminating Tyrants and Bringing Peace
	Establishing New Governments Everywhere

Since the beginning of this year, the people in enemy-occupied areas have vigorously cooperated with the People's Liberation Armed Forces in their attacks, rising up to fight and destroying many "strategic hamlets" and other forms of concentration camps. They have also dismantled a large number of enemy rural administrative structures, freeing themselves from the reactionary rule of the U.S.-puppet regime. These people, who have long suffered under the enemy's cruel oppression, have, after gaining liberation, expressed their deep hatred by denouncing the crimes of the U.S.-puppet regime. With the help of the National Liberation Front, they have punished those reactionary elements who have committed heinous crimes. At the same time, the broad masses of the people, under the leadership of the National Liberation Front, have been actively engaged in election work to establish revolutionary governments. According to reports from the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency, by early May, 177 communes in the central region of the south, including old liberated areas, had established People's Liberation Committees. Some provinces have even convened county people's representative meetings to elect county-level People's Liberation Committees. As of now, seven counties in the provinces of Quang Ngai, including Vinh Thuan, Duong Xuan, Nam Tra My, Binh Son, Thua Thien, and Quy Nhon, and five counties in the Quang Tri-Da Nang region, including Phu Loc, Phu Vang, Huong Tra, Huong Thuy, and Hai Lang, have all established county-level revolutionary governments. By mid-July, the counties in the liberated areas of Kontum Province had also successfully completed the election of commune-level and county-level revolutionary governments.

	On election days, the liberated people are joyful and enthusiastic, eagerly participating in voting. In some places, 100% of the voters participated in the voting.

	The broad masses of the people joyfully say: "Now this government is truly the people's government."

	Joining the Army to Fight the Enemy
	Youths, Both Male and Female, Rush to the Front Lines

	To defend the newly born revolutionary government and to achieve a complete victory in the struggle against American aggression and for national salvation, the broad masses of the people have actively mobilized to establish "combat communes" and "combat villages" to resist enemy attacks. Young men and women have enthusiastically enlisted and rushed to the front lines to fight the enemy and save the nation. By the end of May in the central region of the south, tens of thousands of young men and women had already joined the army or participated in assault teams and labor service teams. In some provinces in the southern central region, the number of young people enlisting in the first three months of this year has doubled compared to the entire previous year. The people in the liberated areas, under the slogan "Everything for the front, everything for victory," have also generously donated money and grain to contribute to the struggle against American aggression and for national salvation. The people in the liberated areas of the Mekong Delta and the liberated areas of Quang Ngai Province have already overfulfilled their tasks of paying public funds and public grain.

	Restoring Production
	Helping People Improve Their Lives

	The newly established revolutionary governments in various places have led the people in restoring and developing production and helping them improve their lives. Despite the enemy's continuous bombing and sabotage, many regions have still managed to cultivate crops on time. To promote production, supply and marketing cooperatives have been established in various places to strengthen the exchange of materials. Provinces like Tra Vinh have established sugar mills, small ironworks, and small shipyards to vigorously develop handicraft production. In addition, schools and medical stations at various levels have also been established like bamboo shoots after a rain. The broad masses of the people are extremely delighted and inspired by this new situation after liberation. They are determined to defend the liberated areas, continue the struggle against American aggression and for national salvation, and strive for final victory.

    在越南南方民族解放阵线的领导下
    南越新解放区充满一片新气象
    据新华社河内电　越南南方新解放区人民，在越南南方民族解放阵线的领导下，积极行使自己当家作主的权利，在惩办恶棍、建立革命政权的同时，采取各种措施保卫和建设解放区，使刚刚解放的地区呈现一片欣欣向荣的景象。
      除暴安民
    处处建立新政权
    今年新春以来，敌占区人民大力配合人民解放武装力量的进攻，奋起斗争，捣毁了许多变相集中营——“战略村”，瓦解了敌人大量的农村统治机构，使自己从美伪集团的反动统治下解放出来。这些长期遭受敌人残酷压迫的人民，在获得解放以后，怀着无比的仇恨，纷纷控诉美伪集团的罪恶统治，并在民族解放阵线的帮助下，惩办那些为非作歹、罪大恶极的反动分子。与此同时，广大人民在民族解放阵线的领导下，纷纷进行选举工作，建立革命政权。据越南南方解放通讯社报道，截至五月初，南部中区包括老解放区在内，已有一百七十七个乡建立了人民解放委员会。有些省还召开了县人民代表会议，选举了县人民解放委员会。到目前为止，金瓯省王轩、督江、南根、沿海、泰平、稼莱和盖诺七个县，广治—承天地区的富禄、富汪、香水、香田和海陵等县都成立了县级革命政权。到七月中旬，昆嵩省解放区各县也都圆满完成了乡级和县级革命政权的选举工作。
    在选举的日子里，解放了的人民喜气洋洋，满怀革命激情地踊跃参加投票。有的地方百分之百的选民参加了投票。
    广大人民高兴地说：“现在的政权才真正是人民的政权。”
      参军杀敌
    男女青年奔赴前线
    为了保卫新生的革命政权，并夺取抗美救国斗争的彻底胜利，广大人民积极动员起来建立“战斗乡”和“战斗村”，抗击敌人的进攻。男女青年们纷纷报名参军，奔向前线杀敌救国。在南部中区，到五月底为止，已经有数十万男女青年参军或参加突击队和民工队。在中部南区的一些省里，今年头三个月青年参军的人数比去年全年增加了一倍。解放区人民在“一切为了前线，一切为了胜利”的口号下，还大力捐款捐粮，为抗美救国作出贡献。湄公河三角洲各地解放区人民和金瓯省解放区人民已经超额完成了缴纳公款、公粮的任务。
      恢复生产
    帮助人民改善生活
    各地新建立的革命政权，大力领导人民恢复和发展生产，帮助人民改善生活。尽管敌人不断地进行疯狂的轰炸和破坏，许多地区仍不违农时地进行耕作。为了促进生产，各地普遍建立了供销合作社，加强物资交流。茶荣等省还建立了糖厂、小型铁工厂和小型造船厂等，大力发展手工业生产。此外，各级学校和医疗站，也都如雨后春笋般地建立起来。广大人民对于解放后的这种崭新的景象，感到万分欢欣鼓舞，他们决心为保卫解放区，进而把抗美救国斗争进行到底，夺取最后胜利而奋斗。
