	Black people in Seattle, a major port city in the northwestern United States, have bravely continued their struggle against violence for three consecutive nights. On the night of the 31st, just like the previous two nights, large numbers of black people took to the streets to demonstrate against racist oppression. They threw bricks and bottles at the shops and cars of white racists, and set fire to yachts used by white racists for entertainment. In several places, the sound of black people's resistance guns could be heard.

	The police chief is terrified of this situation and has ordered the mobilization of the entire city's police force for suppression. They ruthlessly released tear gas on the demonstrators and savagely arrested black people.

　　涌上街头反对种族主义压迫
    美国西雅图黑人坚持抗暴斗争
    新华社二日讯　华盛顿消息：美国西北部重要港口西雅图市的黑人群众接连三个晚上坚持进行英勇的抗暴斗争。三十一日晚上，象前两个夜晚一样，大批大批的黑人涌上街头举行反对种族主义压迫的示威。他们用砖头和瓶子砸白人种族主义者的商店和汽车，放火烧毁供白人种族主义者寻欢作乐的游艇。若干地方还响起了黑人抗暴的枪声。
    警察头子对这种局势怕得要死，下令调集全市的警察部队进行镇压。他们穷凶极恶地对示威群众施放催泪瓦斯，并野蛮逮捕黑人群众。
