In the triumphant songs of seizing complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, another piece of exhilarating news has arrived: on August 5th, our dearest and reddest Red Sun, Chairman Mao, passed on the precious gifts of mangoes presented by foreign friends to the workers and peasants of the capital who propagate Mao Zedong Thought. This is the greatest concern, the greatest encouragement, and the greatest inspiration from our great leader Chairman Mao for the working class. We shout a thousand and ten thousand times, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao!"

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! You always care for and support the working class in all our revolutionary actions. Last year, under the counterattack of the capitalist roaders headed by China's Khrushchev, our station also split into two factions, each doing their own thing, fighting "internal wars," and straying from the leadership center of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. The result was that it caused pain to our allies and joy to our enemies. At that time, our great leader kindly instructed us: "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." Chairman Mao's great teachings dispelled the clouds in our minds, allowing the two factions to quickly unite on the basis of revolution, rallying around the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and uniting under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. From then on, we united as one, directing our spears at the handful of class enemies headed by China's Khrushchev, shattering the capitalist roaders' counterattacks time and again, and repelling the handful of class enemies' advances time and again. We hacked through the thorns and surged forward, seizing victory after victory.

Practice has proven that the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin is the sole leadership center representing the fundamental interests of the working class. Only the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin can most fully represent the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the people. It relies on the people in everything and protects the people everywhere. We must completely trust and resolutely obey this leadership center, closely uniting around this leadership center, to seize complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The reactionary bourgeois "multi-center theory" disperses the unity of the revolutionary ranks based on Mao Zedong Thought, hinders the implementation of the proletarian revolutionary line, and interferes with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments. Within the revolutionary ranks, the constant expansion of small factions and small cliques is an extremely dangerous tendency towards splitism. We advise those who hold the "multi-center theory" not to forget that in the history of the Chinese revolution, how many who caused splits and independence have all ended in failure. The great traitor Chen Duxiu was like this, the great ambitionist Zhang Guotao was like this, and the great renegade China's Khrushchev is also like this. They have all been crushed by the wheels of history. If those who advocate the "multi-center theory" do not stop, their fate will not be better than theirs.

Chairman Mao supports us, we support Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao opposes us, we oppose Chairman Mao. The working class of the capital will not disappoint the great leader Chairman Mao's expectations for us. We must unite more closely around the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, resolutely carry out every battle command issued by the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, thoroughly criticize the "multi-center theory," and march forward to victory under the leadership of Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters, seizing complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

　　在毛主席的无产阶级司令部领导下胜利前进！
　　北京铁路局永定门车站革命委员会
    在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，又传来了振奋人心的特大喜讯：八月五日，我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席，把外国朋友赠送给毛主席的珍贵礼物——芒果，转送给首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队。这是伟大领袖毛主席对我们工人阶级最大的关怀，最大的鞭策，最大的鼓舞。我们千遍万遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您老人家最关心我们工人阶级，最支持我们工人阶级的一切革命行动。去年，在中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线的反扑下，我们车站也分成了两大派，各自为政，互打“内战”，离开了以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的领导中心，结果使亲者痛、仇者快。这时，伟大领袖亲切教导我们：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”毛主席的伟大教导驱散了我们头脑中的乌云，使我们两大派组织很快地在革命的基础上联合起来，团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部周围，统一在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的领导之下。从此，我们才团结一致，把矛头对准了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的一小撮阶级敌人，粉碎了资产阶级反动路线一次又一次的反扑，打退了一小撮阶级敌人一次又一次的进攻。披荆斩棘，乘风破浪，夺取了一个又一个的胜利。
    实践证明，以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，是代表我们工人阶级根本利益的唯一的领导  中心。只有以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，才最集中地代表了最广大人民群众的最根本利益，它一切依靠人民群众，处处保护人民群众。我们只有完全相信、坚决服从这个领导中心，紧紧地团结在这个领导中心的周围，才能夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
      反动的资产阶级的“多中心论”，它涣散革命队伍在毛泽东思想基础上的团结，妨碍无产阶级革命路线的贯彻执行，干扰毛主席的伟大战略部署。在革命队伍内部，一味的扩张小山头、小团体，是一种极端危险的分裂主义倾向。我们奉劝那些持“多中心论”的人，不要忘记中国革命史上有多少闹独立、搞分裂的人都以自己的失败而告终的。大叛徒陈独秀是这样，大野心家张国焘是这样，大工贼中国赫鲁晓夫也是如此。他们都被历史的车轮碾得粉碎。如果闹“多中心论”的人不悬崖勒马，其下场也不会比他们好。
    毛主席支持我支持，毛主席反对我反对。我们首都工人阶级决不辜负伟大领袖毛主席对我们的期望，我们一定要更加紧密地团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部周围，坚决执行以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部发出的每一个战斗号令，彻底批判“多中心论”，在毛主席的无产阶级司令部领导下胜利前进，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
