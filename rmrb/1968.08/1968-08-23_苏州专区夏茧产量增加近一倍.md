	Suzhou Region in Jiangsu Province has achieved a near doubling of its summer cocoon production following the bumper harvest of spring cocoons. The region has reported that the total summer cocoon production is nearly double that of last year.

	The bumper harvest of summer cocoons in Suzhou Region is the result of resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production" and his latest directives. After the successful harvest of spring cocoons, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have further carried out the great movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's thoughts. They have grasped revolution and vigorously promoted production, achieving new victories.

    苏州专区夏茧产量增加近一倍
    江苏省苏州专区继春茧获得大丰收后，又传来了夏茧总产量比去年增加近一倍的喜讯。
    苏州专区夏茧大丰收，是坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针和一系列最新指示的结果。广大贫下中农在喜获春茧大丰收以后，进一步开展活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动，狠抓革命，猛促生产，夺取了新的胜利。
