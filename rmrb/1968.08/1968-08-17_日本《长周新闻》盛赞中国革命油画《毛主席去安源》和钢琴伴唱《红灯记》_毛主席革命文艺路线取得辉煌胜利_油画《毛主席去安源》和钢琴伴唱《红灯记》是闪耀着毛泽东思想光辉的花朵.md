Tokyo, August 15 (Xinhua) — The Japanese newspaper *Chōshū Shinbun* recently published an article enthusiastically praising the birth of the Chinese revolutionary oil painting *Chairman Mao Goes to Anyuan* and the piano-accompanied opera *The Red Lantern*. The article exclaims, "Under the leadership of the great leader of the world's peoples, Chairman Mao, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved comprehensive victory. The Chinese people, numbering 700 million, have achieved brilliant victories on the cultural front."

*Chōshū Shinbun* also published photos of the revolutionary oil painting *Chairman Mao Goes to Anyuan* and a scene from the piano-accompanied opera *The Red Lantern* on the same page as the article.

The article states, "Under the leadership of the great leader of the world's peoples, Chairman Mao, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved comprehensive victory. The Chinese people, numbering 700 million, have achieved brilliant victories on the cultural front. The piano-accompanied Beijing opera *The Red Lantern* excerpt and the oil painting masterpiece *Chairman Mao Goes to Anyuan*, published to commemorate the 47th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, are the splendid blooms that have emerged from Chairman Mao's teachings of 'learning from foreign cultures to serve China and innovating to create something new.' These two works are great victories following the revolutionary model operas *Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy*, *The Red Lantern*, *Shajiabang*, *On the Docks*, and *Attack on the White Tiger Regiment*, the modern ballet *The White-Haired Girl* and *The Red Detachment of Women*, and the modern symphony *Shajiabang*."

The article states, "The victories of the Mao Zedong revolutionary line in the arts have inspired the revolutionary artists and people's struggles in Japan, and have dealt a heavy blow to the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, the revisionist clique led by Kobayashi, and the ghosts and monsters who have infiltrated the anti-imperialist, anti-revisionist ranks."

The article states, "The piano-accompanied Beijing opera *The Red Lantern* excerpt is a new type of proletarian art work created under the personal guidance and leadership of Jiang Qing, deputy director of the Central Cultural Revolution Group. It is another beautiful flower in the Chinese revolutionary arts that radiates the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought."

The article states, "This attempt at 'learning from foreign cultures to serve China' is a new creation and a new variety in proletarian revolutionary arts. It has opened up new paths for Western instruments and symphonies, and for the accompaniment of traditional Chinese dramas; it fully demonstrates the powerful vitality of new arts. It once again demonstrates the immense power of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in the arts."

The article states, "The oil painting masterpiece *Chairman Mao Goes to Anyuan* was completed from design to completion in just over two months. The creation of such a proletarian art masterpiece in such a short time is another victory for the Chinese people who are carrying out the Cultural Revolution, and a victory for Mao Zedong Thought."

The article states, "This painting has dealt a heavy blow to the Chinese Khrushchev. The Chinese Khrushchev falsely claims credit for the achievements of others, fabricates legends, and proclaims himself to be the 'leader of the Anyuan workers' movement.' In fact, he infiltrated Anyuan in September 1922 to oppose Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and committed a series of counter-revolutionary crimes."

    日本《长周新闻》盛赞中国革命油画《毛主席去安源》和钢琴伴唱《红灯记》
    毛主席革命文艺路线取得辉煌胜利
    油画《毛主席去安源》和钢琴伴唱《红灯记》是闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的花朵
    新华社十五日讯　东京消息：日本《长周新闻》最近发表文章，热烈赞扬中国革命油画《毛主席去安源》和钢琴伴唱《红灯记》的诞生。文章欢呼：“在全世界人民的伟大领袖毛主席亲自领导的无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的形势下，中国七亿人民在文艺战线上取得了辉煌的胜利。”
    《长周新闻》还在发表这篇文章的同一版上刊登了革命油画《毛主席去安源》和钢琴伴唱《红灯记》的剧照。
    文章说：“在全世界人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席亲自领导的无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的形势下，中国七亿人民在文艺战线上取得了辉煌的胜利。为纪念中国共产党成立四十七周年而发表的钢琴伴唱京剧《红灯记》片断和油画杰作《毛主席去安源》，是毛主席的‘洋为中用、推陈出新’的教导开放出来的瑰丽的鲜花。这两个作品是继革命现代京剧样板戏《智取威虎山》、《红灯记》、《沙家浜》、《海港》、《奇袭白虎团》，现代芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》、《红色娘子军》，现代交响乐《沙家浜》之后取得的伟大胜利。”
    文章说：“毛泽东革命文艺路线的这些胜利鼓舞着日本的革命文艺战士和人民的斗争，同时沉重地打击了反对‘齿轮座’剧团和无产阶级文艺路线的美日反动派、宫本修正主义一伙以及钻进反帝反修队伍的牛鬼蛇神。”
    文章说：“钢琴伴唱京剧《红灯记》片断，是在中央文化革命小组第一副组长江青亲自培育、领导下创造出来的无产阶级的新型艺术作品；它是放射着毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉的中国革命文艺的又一朵美丽的花朵。”
    文章说：“这一洋为中用的尝试是无产阶级革命文艺的新创作，新品种。它为西洋乐器和交响乐开辟了新道路，为中国传统戏剧的伴奏开辟了新道路；充分地显示了新文艺的强大生命力。它又一次显示了毛主席的无产阶级革命文艺路线的无比威力。”
    文章说：油画杰作《毛主席去安源》“从设计到画成，只用了两个月多一点的时间。这样一件无产阶级艺术的杰作在这样短的时间里创造出来，是进行着文化大革命的中国人民的又一胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利。”
    文章说：“这幅油画给了中国赫鲁晓夫迎头痛击。中国赫鲁晓夫贪天之功为己有，编造传说，宣扬自己才是‘安源工人运动的领袖’。其实他在一九二二年九月钻进安源，对抗毛主席的革命路线，犯下了一系列的反革命罪行。”
