Editor Comrade:

We have just studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Our great leader, Chairman Mao, has personally received the representatives of the working class of our capital. At this joyous moment, each of us workers has so much to say, but we are too excited to speak a single word. Gazing at Chairman Mao's portrait, our eyes are filled with tears. Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! You understand us, care for us, and trust us the most. You have led us to overthrow the "three big mountains" that weighed heavily upon our heads and rescued us from the bitter sea of the old society. You have led us in the great socialist revolution and socialist construction, making our great socialist motherland prosperous. You ignited the blazing flames of the Cultural Revolution, leading us to overthrow Liu Shaoqi and his agents, ensuring that we workers do not take a detour and suffer twice. In the Cultural Revolution, you have issued a series of new instructions, guiding us to victory after victory. Today, as we strive for the complete victory of the Cultural Revolution, you have profoundly pointed out: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully bring into play the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work. The working class should also raise its political awareness in the struggle." This is the greatest care and greatest encouragement for us workers! We feel deeply moved and infinitely happy!

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! You want us workers to play a leading role, and we will definitely do so. You support us, and we will make you proud. The tasks you have given us workers are arduous. We are determined and confident not to disappoint your expectations. We will definitely arm ourselves with your thoughts and follow your teachings to "criticize and repudiate revisionism and fight against selfishness," continuously raise our political awareness in class struggle, resist the infiltration of bourgeois ideology, and become genuine revolutionary cadres who are determined to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end. We workers have only one mind—closely follow Chairman Mao and achieve the complete victory of the Cultural Revolution!

    我们只有一个心眼——紧跟毛主席编辑同志：
    我们刚学习了毛主席的最新指示，伟大领袖毛主席又亲自接见了我们首都工人阶级的代表，在这喜上加喜的幸福时刻，我们每个工人心里都有好多话要讲，可又激动得一句也说不出来。仰望着毛主席像，我们热泪盈眶。毛主席啊，毛主席！您最了解、最关心、最信任我们工人阶级，您永远和我们工人阶级心连心。是您领导我们推倒了压在头上的“三座大山”，把我们从旧社会的苦海中救了出来；是您领导我们进行伟大的社会主义革命和社会主义建设，使我们社会主义伟大祖国欣欣向荣；是您点燃了无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火，领导我们打倒了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人，不叫我们工人阶级走回头路，受二茬罪。在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，您又发表了一系列最新指示，指引着我们夺取一个又一个的胜利。在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的今天，您又深刻地指出：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”这是对我们工人阶级最大的关怀，最大的鞭策！我们从内心深处感到无比兴奋，无限幸福！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您要我们工人阶级发挥主力军作用，我们坚决照办。您给我们撑腰，我们一定给您争气。您老人家交给我们工人阶级的任务是艰巨的。我们有决心，有信心不辜负您老人家的期望，坚决用您的思想武装自己，遵循您的教导，“要斗私，批修”，在阶级斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟，抵制资产阶级思想的侵蚀，做一个决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派，做一个名副其实的毛主席的好工人！我们工人阶级只有一个心眼，就是紧跟毛主席，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
