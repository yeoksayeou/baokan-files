The Revolutionary Committee of Yuxiang County Yuhong Middle School organized revolutionary teachers and students to go deep into the countryside, learn from poor and lower-middle peasants, and receive profound class education.

Since the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, the entire school has organized revolutionary teachers and students to go to more than 320 production brigades across the county to learn from poor and lower-middle peasants. They ate, lived, worked, studied, and criticized Liu Shaoqi (China's Khrushchev) together, which effectively promoted the in-depth development of the revolutionary criticism and greatly enhanced the awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan: The Revolutionary Committee of Yuhong Middle School in Xiyang County, Shanxi Province, organized revolutionary teachers and students to go deep into the countryside, learn from poor and lower-middle peasants, and receive profound class education. They also carried out revolutionary criticism in conjunction with actual class struggles, which effectively promoted the in-depth development of revolutionary criticism throughout the school and greatly enhanced the awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines among revolutionary teachers and students.

After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee in October last year, a major task facing the committee was how to lead revolutionary teachers and students to actively launch attacks on class enemies, carry out in-depth revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticize and denounce Liu Shaoqi and a handful of class enemies, and criticize them deeply and thoroughly. The Revolutionary Committee, following Chairman Mao's teachings that "intellectuals, if they do not integrate with the workers and peasants, will achieve nothing," decided, based on the demands of revolutionary teachers and students, to adopt various methods to organize everyone to go to the poor and lower-middle peasants, learn from them, and conduct revolutionary criticism in conjunction with actual class struggles.

This school organized revolutionary teachers and students to go to the poor and lower-middle peasants in two ways. One method was to organize them in batches to go down to the countryside. Since the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, the entire school has organized revolutionary teachers and students to go to more than 320 production brigades across the county to learn from poor and lower-middle peasants. After going down to the countryside, they ate, lived, worked, studied, and criticized Liu Shaoqi together with the poor and lower-middle peasants. During the day, the teachers and students participated in labor, and during rest times, they propagated Chairman Mao's latest instructions. In the evening, they held criticism meetings with the poor and lower-middle peasants, and invited them to tell their family histories and village histories, denounce the evil old society, and denounce Liu Shaoqi's crimes of attempting to restore capitalism in the countryside and schools. Another method was to mobilize revolutionary teachers and students to use their spare time to go to the villages around the school, especially to the homes of old poor peasants who had deep grievances, to work with them and invite them to tell their family histories, the oppression and exploitation of the landlord class, class struggles, and seek their opinions on educational revolution. They also studied Chairman Mao's instructions on educational revolution together. Now, within a radius of ten miles around the school, there are footprints of revolutionary teachers and students from this school. The third method was to invite some grassroots cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants from the countryside to give lectures to revolutionary teachers and students on the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines in the countryside; denounce the harm of the revisionist educational line to youth; and the hopes of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants for revolutionary youth. Some invited returned youth who participated in production to talk about the problems they found in school education through class struggle and production practice.

Revolutionary teachers and students went out of the small classrooms of the school and into the large classrooms of rural class struggles, receiving profound education on class struggles and the struggle between the two lines. Their class stance and emotions underwent profound changes, and their awareness of criticizing Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line also increased. Revolutionary criticism was carried out more broadly and deeply. Teachers and students, in conjunction with the tasks of each period, actively carried out various forms and contents of criticism activities. In addition to holding large meetings in the school to systematically criticize Liu Shaoqi and his agents in the school who promoted the revisionist educational line of intellectual education first, college entrance first, professional skills first, and scores first, they also adopted flexible and diverse forms to carry out small-scale criticism activities with different contents. For example, some revolutionary teachers and students, while participating in labor, criticized Liu Shaoqi's crimes of trying to cultivate students into bourgeois intellectuals who are detached from proletarian politics, reality, the masses, and labor, according to Chairman Mao's teachings that "education must serve proletarian politics and must be combined with productive labor." Some teachers and students, while taking the course "Learn from Dazhai in Agriculture," learned the revolutionary spirit and scientific farming knowledge of the people of Dazhai, and criticized Liu Shaoqi's crimes of trying to strangle the red flag of Dazhai and consistently opposing the revolutionary spirit of the people of Dazhai. In the past, the writing classes in the school guided students to fantasize and make up stories. Now, the writing classes are about writing criticism articles, which are then broadcasted or posted on the walls to fight against class enemies. In the past, the reactionary clique in the educational and publishing circles included the poisonous weeds of Liu Shaoqi and the counter-revolutionary two-faced traitor Tao Zhu in the textbooks. Now, revolutionary teachers and students, while taking Chinese language classes, use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to uproot these weeds and turn the Chinese language classes into criticism classes. Sometimes, students also held various small-scale criticism meetings in the dormitories to criticize the black goods of Liu Shaoqi's revisionist line. Some returned youth also, with their own experiences of responding to Chairman Mao's call to walk the path of integrating with the poor and lower-middle peasants, together with their classmates, severely criticized Liu Shaoqi and a handful of capitalist roaders within the party who poisoned the youth with the feudalist thought of "all occupations are inferior, only reading is superior." In the criticism, revolutionary teachers and students learned one of Chairman Mao's quotations, criticized one of Liu Shaoqi's reactionary fallacies, and eliminated one stream of poison, thereby pushing the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought throughout the school to new heights.

To further deepen the revolutionary criticism, the Revolutionary Committee of Yuhong Middle School organized revolutionary teachers and students to seriously study and promptly implement each new instruction from the great leader Chairman Mao, ensuring that the revolutionary criticism continuously reaches new heights.

The results of Yuhong Middle School's Revolutionary Committee organizing revolutionary teachers and students to seriously learn from poor and lower-middle peasants and carry out in-depth revolutionary criticism have given revolutionary teachers and students profound education on class struggles and the struggle between the two lines. Currently, the educational revolution is being carried out in depth throughout the school, and the appearance of revolutionary teachers and students has been renewed.

　　昔阳县育红中学革委会组织革命师生深入农村
　　拜贫下中农为师接受深刻的阶级教育
    从革委会成立到现在，全校共组织革命师生到全县三百二十多个生产大队去向贫下中农学习，和贫下中农同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习、同批判中国赫鲁晓夫，有力地推动了革命大批判的深入开展，大大提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟
    新华社太原电　山西省昔阳县育红中学革命委员会，广泛组织革命师生深入农村，拜贫下中农为师，请贫下中农向革命师生进行阶级教育，同时结合阶级斗争的实际开展革命大批判，有力地推动了全校革命大批判的深入开展，大大提高了革命师生的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。
    育红中学革委会在去年十月成立后，摆在面前的一个艰巨任务，就是怎样带领广大革命师生主动地向阶级敌人发动进攻，深入开展革命的大批判，把中国赫鲁晓夫等一小撮阶级敌人彻底斗倒斗臭，批深批透。革委会遵照毛主席关于“知识分子如果不和工农民众相结合，则将一事无成”的教导，根据广大革命师生的要求，决定采取多种方法，组织大家到贫下中农中去，拜贫下中农为师，一面让贫下中农向广大革命师生进行阶级教育，一面结合阶级斗争实际开展革命大批判。
    这个中学组织革命师生到贫下中农中去，一种方法是有组织地分期分批下去，从革委会成立到现在，全校共组织革命师生到全县三百二十多个生产大队去向贫下中农学习。他们下乡以后，和贫下中农同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习、同批判中国赫鲁晓夫。师生们白天参加劳动，休息时就宣传毛主席的各项最新指示，晚上分头和贫下中农一起开批判会，并且请贫下中农讲家史、村史，控诉万恶的旧社会，控诉中国赫鲁晓夫在农村和学校复辟资本主义的罪行。另一种方法是，广泛发动革命师生利用课余时间到学校周围的村子里去，到一些苦大仇深的老贫农家里去，和他们一起劳动，同时请老贫农讲家史，讲地主阶级对贫下中农的压迫和剥削，讲阶级斗争，征求老贫农对教育革命的意见，同他们一道学习毛主席关于教育革命的各项指示。现在，学校周围十里以内的村子，都有这个学校革命师生的足迹。他们向贫下中农学习的第三种方法是，请一些农村基层干部和贫下中农给革命师生讲课，讲农村两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争；控诉修正主义教育路线对青年的毒害，以及广大贫下中农对革命青年的希望；还有的请回乡参加生产的知识青年讲他们通过阶级斗争和生产斗争实践，体会到学校教育中存在的问题。
    广大革命师生走出学校的小课堂，来到农村阶级斗争的大课堂，接受深刻的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的教育，阶级立场和思想感情发生了深刻的变化，批判中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义教育路线的自觉性也更高了，革命的大批判，开展得更加广泛而深入。师生们结合每个时期的任务，自动开展各种形式、各种内容的批判活动。他们除在学校开大会系统地批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其在学校的代理人推行的智育第一，升学第一，业务第一，分数第一等一整套修正主义教育路线外，还采用灵活多样的形式开展各种内容不同的小型批判活动。例如，有的革命师生参加劳动时，就根据毛主席关于“教育必须为无产阶级政治服务，必须同生产劳动相结合”的教导，批判中国赫鲁晓夫千方百计把学生培养成脱离无产阶级政治、脱离实际、脱离群众、脱离劳动的资产阶级知识分子的罪行。有的师生上“农业学大寨”一课时，一面学习大寨人的革命精神和科学种田的知识，一面批判中国赫鲁晓夫妄图扼杀大寨这面红旗，一贯反对大寨人的革命精神的罪行。过去学校上作文课，都是引导学生去胡思乱想，瞎编故事，现在的作文课就是写批判文章，写了就广播、登墙报，同阶级敌人战斗。过去教育界、出版界的走资派把中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命两面派陶铸等坏家伙的大毒草编在课本里，现在革命师生上语文课时，就以毛泽东思想为武器来锄这些毒草，把语文课变成了大批判课。有时，学生们还在宿舍里召开各种小型批判会，批判中国赫鲁晓夫推行的修正主义黑货。有的回乡知识青年还以自己响应毛主席的号召，走同贫下中农相结合的道路的体会，和在校同学一起，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派用“万般皆下品，唯有读书高”的封建主义思想毒害青年的罪行。在批判中，革命师生学习毛主席的一条语录，批判中国赫鲁晓夫的一个反动谬论，肃清一股流毒，从而把全校活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动推向新的高潮。
    为了使革命大批判进一步深入，育红中学革委会每当伟大领袖毛主席发出一个最新指示，就立即组织革命师生认真学习，坚决贯彻执行，使革命大批判不断提高到新的水平。
    育红中学革委会组织革命师生认真向贫下中农学习和深入开展革命大批判的结果，使广大革命师生受到了深刻的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争教育。目前全校教育革命正在深入开展，革命师生面貌一新。
