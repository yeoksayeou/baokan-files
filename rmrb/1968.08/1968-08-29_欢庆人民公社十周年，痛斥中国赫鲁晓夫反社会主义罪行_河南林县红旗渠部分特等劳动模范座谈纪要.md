In celebration of the 10th anniversary of the People's Commune, several outstanding labor models from the Red Flag Canal in Lin County, Henan, held a meeting to discuss the unparalleled advantages of the People's Commune. They enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" and used ironclad facts to denounce the counterrevolutionary fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev, who slandered the People's Commune as being "established too early" and "a failure." Below is a summary of the meeting.

Chairman Mao Guides Us on the Golden Bridge to Communism

Wang Hei, a poor peasant and former worker on the Red Flag Canal construction site from Daxiangshan Village, Hejian Commune, said: At this moment of fully achieving victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, commemorating the 10th anniversary of the People's Commune fills my heart with excitement and joy. I want to shout: The People's Commune is good! The People's Commune is truly good!

Our village is located in a drought-stricken, water-scarce mountainous area. Historically, the people have often suffered from famine and water shortages. The old peasant Cui Tongshan, for example, faced ruin due to water issues. In 1943, during a severe drought, the old man traveled eight miles to the Xixian River to fetch water and did not return. His daughter-in-law went to meet him but accidentally spilled the water, causing her to hang herself. The old man also died on the mountain. Whenever the villagers talked about this incident, they were filled with sorrow and tears. Our ancestors have long yearned for water!

In 1958, Chairman Mao issued the great directive that "The People's Commune is good," and we established the People's Commune. With the liberation of productive forces, production resources could be rationally planned and used on a larger scale, creating conditions for large-scale construction and development in the mountainous areas. The entire county mobilized to build the Red Flag Canal, bringing water from the Zhanghe River in Pingxian County, Shanxi Province, to Lin County, changing the drought-stricken landscape and transforming 600,000 acres of dry land into irrigated fields. Our village not only ensures that villagers no longer need to leave the village for water but also irrigates 2,000 acres of land, ensuring bountiful harvests regardless of the weather. Therefore, every time we see the water from the Red Flag Canal, we are filled with boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to Chairman Mao. How can we not be filled with indignation when we hear the Chinese Khrushchev attacking the People's Commune as being "established too early" and "a failure"? Everyone says: Who is good and who is bad, we poor and lower-middle peasants know best. Chairman Mao is our great benefactor, and we will defend him with our lives. The Chinese Khrushchev is our number one enemy, and we will definitely overthrow him and never allow him to rise again!

Li Kecheng, deputy director of the Revolutionary Committee of Hujiazhuang Village, Chengguan Commune, and former squad leader on the Red Flag Canal construction site, said: Chairman Mao guides us onto the broad path of the People's Commune, but the Chinese Khrushchev openly opposes it, attacking the People's Commune as being "established too early" and "a failure." His evil intentions are to restore capitalism in China and make us poor and lower-middle peasants retrace our steps and suffer again. We will never allow this. We have had enough of the bitterness of the old society. At that time, our village of fewer than 200 households suffered from famine, with over 130 households fleeing and over 50 people starving to death. It was Chairman Mao who saved us from the pit of fire and led us step by step towards happiness. We firmly believe in Chairman Mao's great teachings that "Only socialism can save China" and "The People's Commune is good." We will press forward, study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, seize class struggle, fully utilize the advantages of the People's Commune, and with heroic spirit, struggle against nature, work hard, and be self-reliant. We have built the Red Flag Canal on the Taihang Mountains. Our village, known as "Huo Long Gang," has seen grain yields per acre increase from 100-200 jin to over 400 jin after getting water. Agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline production have all developed significantly, and our contributions to the state have increased year by year. In 1966 alone, we sold 180,000 jin of grain to the state and had collective reserves of over 300,000 jin. The living standards of the villagers have also improved significantly, with every household having electricity, and we have established a water-powered flour mill and a machinery repair station using the natural drop of the Red Flag Canal. The once barren mountain village has become a thriving socialist new countryside. Looking back at our journey and forward to the future, the beautiful prospects inspire us to work harder and with greater enthusiasm. The villagers all say: "Without the great leadership of Chairman Mao, there would be no People's Commune; without the People's Commune, there would be no Red Flag Canal, and we would not have the beautiful scenery we enjoy today!"

Mao Zedong Thought Guides Us to Conquer Nature

Chang Gentou, a member of the County Revolutionary Committee and former hero cannon operator on the Red Flag Canal construction site, said: Chairman Mao said, "Apart from the leadership of the Party, the six hundred million people are a decisive factor. The more people, the more discussions, the higher the enthusiasm, and the greater the effort." Under the shining light of the General Line, inspired by the Great Leap Forward, the birth of the People's Commune further promoted a great change in our spiritual outlook and a great liberation of thought. The People's Commune, with its many people and great strength, is invincible. Under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, we fear neither heaven nor earth, neither gods nor ghosts. The slave mentality of being at the mercy of nature is swept away, and everyone breaks through conservative and superstitious ideas, daring to think, dare to do, dare to make revolution, and dare to fight against nature. Building the main canal of the Red Flag Canal, which is 8 meters wide, 4.3 meters high, and 140 li long, and diverting 25 cubic meters of water per second, requires tunneling through the cliffs of the Taihang Mountains, excavating 42 mountain caves, leveling 250 mountain peaks, cutting through 131 steep ridges, filling 141 gullies, and building 96 large and small bridges. But with the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought and the strength of the People's Commune, these difficulties are nothing. Take me, for example. Before the commune, I was in charge of herding cows in the village. When I was assigned to handle explosives on the Red Flag Canal, I was a bit timid. But thinking of Chairman Mao's teachings, "Resolutely determined, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory," my courage grew. I went from handling small explosives to large ones, from fearing rocks to seeking them out. Before, seeing cliffs and precipices was like seeing a man-eating tiger, but now seeing cliffs and precipices is like seeing a tofu block, cutting wherever I want. When our Yao Village Commune was building the air-filled dam on the Zhuo River, there were no stones on the riverbank, so I first climbed up the southern mountain and blasted down 9,000 cubic meters of stones, then climbed up the northern mountain and blasted down over 10,000 cubic meters of stones. The two large blasts provided enough stones to build the air-filled dam and had plenty left over. I personally experienced that the People's Commune has great strength and fears no difficulties. In the face of the People's Commune, mountains bow their heads, rivers yield their way, and all mountains and rivers obey our arrangements. So when I heard that the Chinese Khrushchev was attacking our People's Commune as being "established too early" and "a failure," I was so angry I wanted to explode. This wolf in human skin wants us to retrace our steps, suffer under the exploitation of the rich, and be slaves to nature again. We will never allow it. We will definitely walk the path of the People's Commune, being masters of society and nature!

Guo Xingbao, a poor peasant and former construction worker on the Red Flag Canal from Daping Village, Donggang Commune, said: The third branch of the Red Flag Canal needs to reach our commune, requiring a tunnel 8 li long to be dug through the high and rocky Luozhai Ridge. This is not easy, but everyone said, Chairman Mao taught us, "Among all things in the world, man is the most precious. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, as long as there are people, any miracle in the world can be created." The People's Commune has plenty of people, and everyone is armed with Mao Zedong Thought, so what are we afraid of? Since the Hero Canal's Hero Tunnel, 60 meters long, can be dug through, and the main canal's Youth Tunnel, 600 meters long, can be dug through, then the Luozhai Ridge can definitely be dug through as well.

The digging started from both ends, but because everyone was eager for water, they found ways to speed up the process, opening vertical shafts on the ridge to increase the working faces. As the tunnel deepened, the air inside became scarce, so fans were used to blow in air while workers rotated shifts frequently, and tools were used continuously. Everyone loudly recited, "Resolutely determined, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory." With pickaxes and shovels, they worked day and night for a year and four months, finally completing the 8-li-long Dawn Tunnel. This fully demonstrates the unparalleled advantages of the People's Commune's "one big, two publics." The Chinese Khrushchev's attacks on the People's Commune as being "established too early" and "a failure" are completely malicious, aiming to dismantle socialism and restore capitalism. We want to ask the Chinese Khrushchev: If it weren't for the People's Commune, even individual farming or small-scale agricultural cooperatives would not have the strength to dig through the Luozhai Ridge. How could the Red Flag Canal flow to our drought-stricken village? Opposing the People's Commune is opposing socialism and opposing our poor and lower-middle peasants' struggle for a happy life. How can we not overthrow you!

"Lowly people are the wisest! Noble people are the most foolish!"

Yang Shuangxi, a poor peasant and former technical worker on the Red Flag Canal from Xianguan Commune, said: Chairman Mao said, "Among the Chinese people, there are indeed countless 'Zhuge Liangs.' In every village and town, there are 'Zhuge Liangs' there." In the vast expanse of the People's Commune, relying on the great Mao Zedong Thought, the peasants' thoughts are liberated, daring to think, dare to do, dare to invent, and dare to create. Everyone's wisdom and talents are fully utilized. For example, on the Red Flag Canal, when drilling tunnels, there were no level gauges for measurement, and when faced with actual difficulties, we studied and adopted the method of piling stones and drawing lines on the mountain slope, using glass mirrors to reflect light into the tunnel to overcome the difficulties. Thus, using local materials to replace imported ones, we dug through one tunnel after another. As for building bridges, historically, building a bridge required "cows" first, small bridges with "mud cows," and large bridges with "wooden cows." The Red Flag Canal has over a hundred large and small bridges. If we used "wooden cows," just the wood would require several trainloads. But with many people and high wisdom, you suggest one idea, I suggest another, and thousands of suggestions combined overcome one difficulty after another, vigorously promoting the "simple bridge-building method," quickly and well building large and small bridges. Many elderly people who visited the Red Flag Canal praised, "Lu Ban is skilled, Lu Ban is skilled, but how can Lu Ban compare to today's new Yu Gong in the People's Commune!" The Red Flag Canal construction site has produced countless "Zhuge Liangs," and clumsy farmers in the People's Commune have become the most talented and wise people. The Chinese Khrushchev treats us as "ignorant masses" to manipulate, slandering the People's Commune as being "established too early" and "a failure," trying to trick us into his "three selfs and one contract" and "four freedoms." That is a foolish dream that will never come true!

Feng Si, a poor peasant and former worker on the Red Flag Canal from Dongyao Village, Dongyao Commune, said: Chairman Mao said, "The wisest and most talented are those with the most practical experience." The massive Red Flag Canal project was designed and constructed by the commune members themselves. Many major structures broke through foreign frameworks and dead dogmas, solving problems that so-called "designers" and "experts" found difficult to solve. For example, the air-filled dam on the Zhuo River, based on our experience, could be built with soil and stone structures, but foreign experts insisted on using reinforced concrete. According to their rules, just the design would take half a year, and the cost would be twice as high as the soil and stone structure. We firmly disagreed, and they designed their way, while we built ours. Half a year passed, and they finally brought the design book to the site from the design institute, but our air-filled dam had already been built and water was flowing. The design of the first branch was also like this. We were born and raised in the Taihang Mountains, knowing the dangers of sandy soil and broken stones, so on this mountain, the canal must be built entirely with stones to prevent seepage. Foreign experts insisted on using red soil. There is no red soil on the mountain, so they ordered it to be brought from the foot of the mountain. We disagreed, taking the case to the provincial level, and practice proved that our opinion was correct. On the third branch, an 8-li-long mountain tunnel needed to be drilled, but foreign "experts" shook their heads and dared not design it. We designed and constructed it simultaneously, drilling through the tunnel. Our wisdom and talents, did they fall from the sky? No. Were they innate? No. It is all the result of being armed with the brilliant thoughts of Chairman Mao. With the People's Commune as a great school, Mao Zedong Thought leading the way, talents and wisdom will definitely emerge. In the countryside, we poor and lower-middle peasants are the most loyal to Chairman Mao and have the most practical experience. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, we can create all kinds of miracles. The entire Red Flag Canal is a great exhibition of our inventions and creations. Whoever sees it praises the commune members' ingenuity. Only the Chinese Khrushchev, with his blind eyes, attacks the People's Commune as being "established too early" and "a failure," truly showing that different classes have different words. The Chinese Khrushchev has always thought differently from us, walked different paths from us. His opposition to us shows that we are on the right path. We will definitely march forward in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao.

Make the People's Commune a Great School of Mao Zedong Thought

Li Wenlin, a poor peasant and former worker on the Red Flag Canal from Nanjingse Village, Caishan Commune, said: In the past, our Nanjingse was famous for being the poorest village in the county, with a folk song saying, "The whole village shares one well, carrying water breaks one's back, nine out of ten years have no harvest, girls do not marry into Jingse Village." After the Red Flag Canal brought water, Nanjingse became a "little Jiangnan": clear water flows from the high mountains, canals crisscross the peaks, drinking water is piped in, fish swim in the reservoirs, dry land becomes irrigated fields, and every year is a bumper harvest. Reflecting on the past ten years of the People's Commune, it has been a decade of struggle between two classes, two roads, and two lines, a decade of victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and a decade of defeat for the Chinese Khrushchev's counterrevolutionary revisionist line. Today, on the occasion of celebrating the 10th anniversary of the People's Commune, our poor and lower-middle peasants love the great leader Chairman Mao even more and love the People's Commune even more. We cannot express our gratitude to Chairman Mao and cannot praise the People's Commune enough! Thinking of Chairman Mao at night, we get up at the first light of dawn; working and thinking of Chairman Mao, we are full of strength. Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts. We will forever read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, becoming good commune members. We are determined to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, making the People's Commune a great school of Mao Zedong Thought that is also engaged in industry, agriculture, culture, and military affairs.

    欢庆人民公社十周年，痛斥中国赫鲁晓夫反社会主义罪行
    ——河南林县红旗渠部分特等劳动模范座谈纪要
    在欢庆人民公社十周年的时候，河南林县红旗渠部分特等劳动模范怀着激动的心情，举行座谈会，畅谈人民公社的无比优越性，纵情高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”并用铁的事实痛斥中国赫鲁晓夫污蔑人民公社“办早了”、“办糟了”的反革命谬论。下面是这次座谈的纪要。
  毛主席指引我们走上通往共产主义的金桥
    合涧公社大南山大队贫农社员、原红旗渠工地民工王黑说：在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的时刻，纪念人民公社十周年，我心里特别兴奋，非常激动。我要高呼：人民公社好！人民公社就是好！
    俺队地处干旱缺水的山区，历史上群众多次逃过粮荒，也多次逃过水荒，老贫农崔同山因吃水闹得家破人亡就是一例。一九四三年大旱，一天老汉翻山越岭到八里远的淅河担水未回，儿媳妇下山去接，一不小心把水倾光，难过万分，就上了吊，老汉也一气上了山西。村里人每谈起这件事，无不伤心落泪。我们祖祖辈辈都多么盼望有水吃呀！
    一九五八年毛主席发出“人民公社好”的伟大指示，我们成立了人民公社。由于生产力大解放，生产资料可以在更大范围内合理规划，统一使用，为大规模地建设山区发展生产创造了条件。全县人民到山西省平顺县引漳河水，大战太行山，修建红旗渠。从一九六○年起，苦战六年，使漳河流到了林县，改变了全县干旱缺水面貌，把六十万亩旱地变成水地。俺队不但社员吃水再也不出村啦，而且两千亩地浇上水，丰收再不靠天。所以大家每天看见红旗渠水，就情不自禁地激起了对毛主席的无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜，无限忠诚。我们听到中国赫鲁晓夫攻击人民公社“办早了”“办糟了”的滥调又怎能不愤恨万分！大伙都说：谁个最好，谁个最劣，我们贫下中农心里最清楚。毛主席是我们的救命大恩人，我们誓死保卫他老人家。中国赫鲁晓夫是我们贫下中农的头号大敌，我们坚决把他打翻在地，再踏上一只脚，叫他永世不得翻身！
    城关公社胡家庄大队革委会副主任、原红旗渠工地连长李科成说：毛主席指引我们走上人民公社的康庄大道，中国赫鲁晓夫却公开跳出来反对，攻击人民公社“办早了”“办糟了”，他的恶毒用心就是想在中国复辟资本主义，让我们贫下中农走回头路，受二遍苦，我们死也不答应。万恶的旧社会的苦头我们尝够了。那时俺村不足二百户人家，因为闹灾荒，就有一百三十多户逃过荒要过饭，活活饿死了五十多口人。是毛主席他老人家从火坑里把我们救了出来，引导我们步步走向幸福。我们坚信毛主席“只有社会主义能够救中国”和“人民公社好”的伟大教导，永往直前，活学活用毛泽东思想，狠抓阶级斗争，充分发挥人民公社的优越性，以战天斗地的英雄气概，艰苦奋斗，自力更生，在太行山上修成了红旗渠。俺队这个
  “火龙岗”有了水后，粮食每亩由一、二百斤猛增至四百多斤，农林牧副各业都有很大发展，对国家贡献一年比一年增加。仅一九六六年就卖给国家粮食十八万斤，集体储备粮达到了三十多万斤。社员生活也有很大提高，家家安上了电灯，还利用红旗渠的自然落差建立了水力面粉加工站、机械修配站，过去苦旱的山村变成欣欣向荣的社会主义新农村。大家从走过的路程展望未来，美好的前景鼓舞着大家越干越想干，越干劲越大。社员们都说：“没有伟大领袖毛主席的领导，就没有人民公社；没有人民公社，就不会有红旗渠，也就不会有如今的美好光景！”
      毛泽东思想指挥我们战胜大自然
    县革命委员会委员、原红旗渠工地英雄炮手常根虎说：毛主席说：“除了党的领导之外，六亿人口是一个决定的因素。人多议论多，热气高，干劲大。”在总路线的光辉照耀下，在大跃进的鼓舞下，人民公社的诞生进一步促进了我们精神面貌大改观，思想大解放。人民公社，人多势众，力量大无穷。在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下，我们不怕天，不怕地，不怕神，不怕鬼，听凭大自然摆布的奴隶思想一扫而光，人人大破保守迷信思想，敢想、敢干、敢革命、敢于向大自然开战。修建宽八米、高四米三、长一百四十华里，引水二十五个秒立米的红旗渠总干渠，要从悬崖绝壁的太行山半腰穿过去，要凿通四十二个山洞，削平二百五十个山头，斩断一百三十一个峻岭，填平一百四十一条沟壑，架设大小桥梁九十六座；但我们有伟大的毛泽东思想的指引，依靠人民公社的强大力量，这些困难就都不在话下。就拿我来说吧，公社化前在村上管放牛，一到红旗渠上分工叫放炮，还有些胆怯。但想到毛主席的教导：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，我的胆也就放大了，由放小炮到放大炮，由害怕石头到找着石头上。以前看见悬崖峭壁就象是见了吃人的老虎，后来见了悬崖峭壁就象见块豆腐，想从那切就从那切。俺姚村公社在浊河修空心坝时，河滩没石头，我先爬上南山一炮崩下石头九千多方，又爬上北山，一炮崩下石头一万多方，两大炮崩下的石头除修成空心坝外还余下很多。我切身体会到：人民公社力量大，什么困难都不怕，在人民公社面前，高山低头，河水让路，一切山川大地都得听我们安排。所以当我听说中国赫鲁晓夫攻击我们的人民公社“办早了”“办糟了”的时候，肺都气炸了。他这个黑心狼，还想叫我们走回头路，既受老财的剥削，又作大自然的奴隶，我们坚决不答应。我们就是要走人民公社道路，既当社会的主人，又做大自然的主人！
    东岗公社大井大队贫农社员、原红旗渠工地施工员郭兴保说：红旗渠第三干渠要通到俺公社，必须从山又高、石头又硬的芦寨岭下凿一个长达八华里的洞子，这是很不容易的。可是大家说，毛主席教导我们：“世间一切事物中，人是第一个可宝贵的。在共产党领导下，只要有了人，什么人间奇迹也可以造出来。”人民公社有的是人，大家用毛泽东思想武装起来，还怕什么？既然英雄渠上的英雄洞长六十多米能凿通，总干渠上的青年洞六百多米能凿通，那末，芦寨岭也一定能凿它个大窟窿。
    凿洞开始是由两头施工，因为大家盼水心切，嫌凿得慢，就出主意想办法，从岭上开天井，开一个天井就能增加两个工作面。洞子凿深后，里边空气少，就一边用风车往里打风，一边坚持勤换班，工具不停。大家高声朗读：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”一锤一锨地日夜奋战，用了一年零四个月，终于凿通了长达八华里的曙光洞。这充分显示了人民公社一大二公的无比优越性。中国赫鲁晓夫攻击人民公社“办早了”“办糟了”，完全是别有用心，是想拆社会主义的台，复辟资本主义。我们要质问中国赫鲁晓夫：要不是办了人民公社，别说单干，就是小规模的农业生产合作社，又咋能有力量凿通芦寨岭？红旗渠咋能流到我们这个历来干旱缺水的山庄？你反对人民公社，就是反对社会主义，就是反对我们贫下中农翻身过幸福的日子，我们怎能不把你打翻在地！
      “卑贱者最聪明！高贵者最愚蠢”
    原康公社下园大队贫农社员、原红旗渠工地原康分指挥部施工技术员杨双喜说：毛主席说：“中国人民中间，实在有成千成万的‘诸葛亮’，每个乡村，每个市镇，都有那里的‘诸葛亮’。”在人民公社这个广阔的天地里，依靠伟大的毛泽东思想，社员思想大解放，敢想，敢干，敢发明，敢创造，每个人的聪明才智都得到了充分发挥。比如在红旗渠上钻洞，没有水平仪测量，遇到实际困难，我们几个人经过研究，就采取在山坡上垒石堆、抹灰线，用玻璃镜往洞里反光的办法克服了困难，就这样以土代洋，打通了一个又一个洞子。再说架桥，历史上凡架桥就得先“搭牛”，小桥是“土牛”，大桥是“木牛”，红旗渠上大小桥涵有百来座，如用“木牛”，光木材也得几火车，可是人多计策高，你一条，我一条，千百条建议集中起来，就闯过了一道道难关，大力推广了“简易架桥法”，又快又好地把大小桥涵矗起来。不少上岁数的老年人到红旗渠上参观，都称赞说：“鲁班能，鲁班能，鲁班咋能比上今天人民公社的新愚公！”红旗渠工地上涌现出了无数个“诸葛亮”，粗手笨脚的庄稼人在人民公社里都成了最有才能的聪明人。中国赫鲁晓夫把我们当作“愚民”“群氓”来玩弄，诬蔑人民公社“办早了”“办糟了”，妄想叫我们上他的“三自一包”“四大自由”的当，那是痴心妄想，一万年也办不到！
    东姚公社东姚大队贫农社员、原红旗渠工地民工冯四说：毛主席说：“最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”工程艰巨的红旗渠，就是我们人民公社社员自己设计自己施工的。有许多重大建筑物，打破了洋框框，死教条，解决了所谓“设计师”、“专家”难于解决的问题。比如浊河上的空心坝，根据我们的经验，用土石结构完全可以，可是洋专家们却说：“书本上没有这种办法。”非强调用钢筋水泥不可。按他们的清规戒律，光设计就得半年，造价要比土石结构高一两倍。我们坚决不同意，他们设计他们的，我们修我们的。半年过去了，他们才从设计院拿着设计书到了工地，我们的空心坝却早已建成通了水。第一干渠的设计也是这样。我们是生在太行山，长在太行山，知道太行山沙土碎石的厉害，在这上面修渠，必须全部用石头垒砌才能防止渗漏。洋专家们偏提出要用红土打。山上没有红土，就叫去山下拉。我们不通，把官司打到省里，实践证明还是我们的意见对。第三干渠上要钻八里长的一个山洞，洋“专家”们摇头摆手不敢设计，还是我们一面设计一面施工，就把洞子钻透了。我们的这些聪明才智，是从天上掉下来的吗？不是，是自己头脑里固有的吗？不是。全是毛主席他老人家的光辉思想把我们武装了起来的结果。有了人民公社这个大学校，毛泽东思想挂了帅，就一定会出人材，出智慧。在农村，我们贫下中农，最忠于毛主席，最有生产实践经验，在毛泽东思想指引下，我们就能够创造出种种人间奇迹。整个红旗渠就是我们发明创造的大展览。谁看了谁都称赞人民公社社员有办法。唯独中国赫鲁晓夫瞪着两眼说瞎话，攻击人民公社“办早了”、“办糟了”，真是什么秧上开什么花，什么阶级说什么话。中国赫鲁晓夫从来就和我们想的不是一条计，走的不是一条道，他反对我们，正说明我们走对了，我们要坚决朝着毛主席指引的方向大步往前奔。
    把人民公社办成毛泽东思想大学校
    采桑公社南景色大队贫农社员、原红旗渠工地民工李文林说：过去，俺南景色在全县是出了名的穷村，有一首民谣是：“全村伙用一眼井，挑水使断脊梁筋，十年就有九不收，有女不嫁景色村。”红旗渠通水后，南景色变成了“小江南”：清水高山流，渠道网山头，吃的自来水，鱼在库中游，旱地变成水浇田，年年都是大丰收。思前想后，人民公社走过的十年，是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的十年，是毛主席革命路线胜利的十年，是中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线破产的十年。今天在庆祝人民公社十周年的时候，俺队贫下中农打心眼里更加热爱伟大领袖毛主席，更加热爱人民公社，千言万语谢不尽毛主席他老人家的恩，讲不尽人民公社的好！半夜想起毛主席，头顶三星就上地；干活想起毛主席，浑身上下添力气。毛主席是我们心中最红最红的红太阳，我们要永远读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好社员。我们决心活学活用毛泽东思想，把人民公社办成亦工亦农亦文亦武的毛泽东思想大学校。
