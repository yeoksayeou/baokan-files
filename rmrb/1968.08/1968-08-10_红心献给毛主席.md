On the afternoon of August 6, a public bus was speeding along a wide road as usual. An old man stood by the window, occasionally leaning out to see which stop the bus had reached, and occasionally taking out his "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to read. However, no matter what he did, he couldn't hide the happy smile on his face.

The old man's name was Yuan Zhen De, a worker at the Beijing Jushan Farm. A few days earlier, he had gone to Tsinghua University with comrades from other units in the capital to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The previous night, the great leader Chairman Mao had passed on a precious gift from foreign friends—a mango—to the capital's workers and peasants' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team. The comrades from Jushan Farm who were propagating Mao Zedong Thought in Tsinghua Garden also received a mango. They were extremely excited, tears streaming down their faces, and they cheered again and again: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!" They took out their "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and wrote down this unforgettable day on the first page. They carefully placed the mango in the middle of the room. Everyone wanted to touch the mango sent by Chairman Mao with their own hands, but they were afraid of dirtying it; everyone wanted to smell the mango's fragrance, but they were afraid of damaging it. The whole night, they talked and talked, truly a thousand words were not enough to express their boundless love for the great leader, nor their loyal hearts for the great teacher!

At this exciting moment, the old worker Yuan Zhen De thought of his life before liberation, when he had to do hard labor and live like a beast of burden; he thought of the long winter nights, wrapped in a tattered quilt, shivering in the cold wind; he thought of his twelve-year-old sister being forced to become a child bride; he especially thought of how the Communist Party led them to revolt and overthrow the landlords; he thought of taking the oath under the party flag to join the party.... He was so moved that tears streamed down his face, and he excitedly said: "I have lived for fifty-seven years. In the old society, I was like a beast of burden. Now, our great leader Chairman Mao has sent us a gift. This is not just a fruit, it is a spiritual atomic bomb sent by Chairman Mao." One sentence struck a chord in everyone's heart. Comrades said one after another: "Comrade Yuan is right. Chairman Mao sending us a mango is not only the greatest care and encouragement for us, but also the greatest care and encouragement for all workers and peasants across the country." Many comrades could not contain their excitement and wrote letters to their relatives and friends to report this great joy. Comrade Yuan thought: Before coming to Tsinghua Garden, he didn't tell his family, but now he had encountered such a great joy, he should take the time to go home and let his family be happy.

That afternoon, as soon as he finished his shift, he eagerly took the bus home, wishing he could fly back home in a single step.

As soon as Comrade Yuan pushed open the door, he said to his three daughters: "Chairman Mao has sent us a mango!" "Mango? What mango?" Comrade Yuan gestured and told them about last night's events. As soon as he finished speaking, his eldest daughter said: "Father, this is not an ordinary mango. It is the greatest support from the great leader Chairman Mao. You must resolutely, thoroughly, and completely implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and strive to propagate Mao Zedong Thought." The two younger daughters also spoke up, one asking Father to study the newspaper editorials well and criticize the reactionary "multi-center theory" with everyone, the other asking Father to work with the revolutionary youngsters of Tsinghua to carry out the educational revolution well. Comrade Yuan hurriedly said: "I understand these things. I hurried back to tell you this good news, just to let you study Mao Zedong Thought well and do everything according to Chairman Mao's instructions." The three daughters said in unison: "We understand too." Father and daughters smiled at each other. Comrade Yuan asked: "Where is your mother?" The daughters answered: "She just went out to buy things. You wait for her, she has a lot to tell you." Comrade Yuan shook his head and said: "I won't wait for her. You tell her. I have to hurry back. Family matters are always small matters, but the matters of our propaganda team are big matters." With that, he lifted his leg and left.

The public bus was speeding along the asphalt road. Comrade Yuan's heart flew to Tsinghua Garden. He stroked the red little book, and his body was filled with boundless strength. He was determined to carry out the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end with the revolutionary youngsters of Tsinghua!

　　红心献给毛主席
　　新红
    八月六日下午，在宽阔的马路上，一辆公共汽车象往常一样疾驶。一位老大爷靠车窗站着，一会儿探身望望汽车到了哪一站，一会儿摸出《毛主席语录》来翻看，但是，无论如何，也掩盖不住他脸上幸福的笑意。
    老大爷名叫袁振德，是北京巨山农场的工人，前些日子和首都其他单位的同志一起到清华大学宣传毛主席的最新指示。昨天晚上，伟大领袖毛主席把外国朋友赠送的珍贵礼物——芒果，转送给了首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队，巨山农场在清华园宣传毛泽东思想的同志也得到了一颗芒果。他们激动万分，热泪盈眶，一阵又一阵地欢呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”他们掏出《毛主席语录》，在第一页上记下这终生难忘的日子。他们小心翼翼地把芒果放在屋子中间，人人都想亲手摸一摸毛主席送的芒果，又怕弄脏了它；个个都想闻一闻芒果的清香，又怕碰坏了它。整整一夜，他们谈啊说啊，真是千言万语，也诉不尽他们对伟大领袖的无限热爱，诉不尽他们对伟大导师的赤胆忠心！
    在这激动人心的时刻，老工人袁振德想起了解放前自己扛长活，做牛做马的生活；想起了漫漫冬夜，盖一件破棉袄，在寒风中抖瑟；想起了十二岁的妹妹被迫去做童养媳；他更想起了共产党领导着咱闹翻身，打倒了地主；想起自己在党旗下宣誓入党，……激动得掉下热泪，兴奋地说：“我活了五十七岁，在旧社会当牛作马，现在我们伟大的领袖毛主席给咱送了礼，这哪是一个果子啊，这是毛主席送来的精神原子弹。”一句话说在大家的心坎上。同志们纷纷说：“袁师傅说得对，毛主席送来芒果，不光是对咱们最大的关怀，最大的鼓舞，也是对全国工农最大的关怀，最大的鼓舞。”好多同志按捺不住兴奋的心情，纷纷给亲友写信，报告这个特大喜讯。袁师傅心想：来清华园前没跟家里说，这会，遇上这样的大喜事，该抽空回家一趟，让家里人高兴高兴。
    这天下午，刚值完班，他就喜孜孜地搭车回家，巴不得一步飞回家中。
    袁师傅刚推开家门，就冲着三个闺女说：“毛主席他老人家给我们送芒果啦！”“芒果，什么芒果？”袁师傅比比划划把昨晚的事讲了一遍。话音刚落，大闺女就接了话碴：“爹，这可不是普通的芒果，这是伟大领袖毛主席对咱们的最大支持。你们可得最坚决、最彻底、最全面地落实毛主席的最新指示，努力宣传毛泽东思想。”两个小闺女也接着发言，一个要爹好好学习报纸社论，和大家一起批判反动的“多中心论”，一个要爹和清华的革命小将一起，搞好教育革命。袁师傅赶忙说：“这些我懂。我急着回来把喜讯告诉你们，就是要你们好好学习毛泽东思想，事事按毛主席的指示办。”三个闺女异口同声地说：“我们也懂。”父女们相对笑了起来。袁师傅问：“你妈呢？”闺女答：“才出去买东西，你等等她吧，她还有好多事要跟你说呢。”袁师傅摇摇头说：“我不等她了，你们跟她说说吧，我得马上赶回去，家里的事总是小事，咱们宣传队的事才是大事呢。”说罢就抬腿出门。
    公共汽车在柏油马路上飞驶着。袁师傅的心飞向了清华园。他抚摸着那本红彤彤的宝书，浑身增添了无比的力量，他决心要和清华的革命小将们一起，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
