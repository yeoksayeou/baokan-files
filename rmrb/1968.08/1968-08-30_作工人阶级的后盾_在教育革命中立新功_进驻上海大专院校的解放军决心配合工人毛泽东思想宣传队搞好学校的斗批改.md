The People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai's colleges and universities, determined to assist the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams in carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the schools.

According to the great leader Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, under the leadership of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee, the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai's land, sea, and air forces actively dispatched a large number of leftist support personnel. By August 27, they had entered all 26 colleges and universities in the city, in collaboration with the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, which are mainly composed of Shanghai industrial workers. The broad ranks of soldiers, filled with deep proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao, are determined to, under the leadership of the working class, work together with the propaganda team's workers, and with the active elements among the students, teachers, and workers in the schools, to carry out the revolutionary three-in-one combination. In the great tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and in the great proletarian cultural revolution, they will perform new deeds for the people.

The Great and Glorious Political Mission

After the great leader Chairman Mao's latest directive, "The working class must fully play its leading role in the cultural revolution and in all work," was issued, the leftist support personnel stationed in Shanghai immediately held Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest directive and prepared to collaborate with the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to enter the colleges and universities. Yao Wenyuan's important article conveyed Chairman Mao's latest directive: "To achieve the proletarian cultural revolution, there must be leadership from the working class, and workers must participate, along with the People's Liberation Army soldiers, to work together with the students, teachers, and workers in the schools who are determined to carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end. The workers' propaganda teams must stay in the schools for a long time, participate in all the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation in the schools, and forever lead the schools. In the countryside, the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants—should manage the schools." The broad ranks of soldiers immediately sprang into action, studying while organizing forces, and together with the industrial workers' army, marched into the colleges and universities. They said: Chairman Mao has given us such a glorious and great political mission. This is the greatest trust and encouragement from Chairman Mao. We will not disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations.

In the new situation where large numbers of workers' propaganda teams have entered the schools, many soldiers who have been fighting alongside the workers' propaganda teams discussed the topic "How to better complete the leftist support mission in the schools." They linked their thoughts to Chairman Mao's latest directive and had a heated discussion. Everyone deeply realized that to fully occupy the educational front that has been controlled by the bourgeois intellectuals, to firmly grasp the power of culture in the hands of the working class, to carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the schools, and to turn the schools into red Mao Zedong Thought schools, this is a hard battle of the proletariat's attack on the bourgeois fortress. The task of the army's leftist support is heavier. We must fight this battle well. Everyone further analyzed the favorable conditions for completing this glorious mission and said with confidence: We have the wise leadership of the great commander Chairman Mao, the spiritually powerful atomic bomb of Chairman Mao's latest directive, the powerful workers' propaganda teams, and the support of the revolutionary Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and staff. In this great battle, we will definitely fight this battle well and will not stop until we achieve complete victory.

Vowing to Be the Strong Backbone of the Working Class

To make the broad revolutionary teachers and students quickly follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and promptly implement Chairman Mao's latest directive, as soon as they entered the schools, the army comrades, together with the workers' propaganda team comrades, widely held Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They helped the revolutionary teachers and students deeply study Chairman Mao's latest directive, raised their awareness of the leading role of the working class, and overcame the erroneous thoughts of some teachers and students who looked down on workers and peasants. Before the workers' propaganda team entered Jiaotong University, the army's leftist support personnel assisted the revolutionary teachers and students in holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They gave big lectures on the great significance of Chairman Mao's latest directive, praised the great achievements of the working class, and talked about the necessity and great significance of the working class leading the proletarian cultural revolution. Many schools also set up big criticism columns to criticize the crimes of Liu Shaoqi and his agents in excluding workers and peasants and sabotaging the working class's leadership in education. Through big study sessions and big criticism, the revolutionary teachers and students gained a correct understanding of the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams entering the schools. They regarded the workers' entry into the schools as a great joy and actively prepared performances, cleaned the environment, and put up welcome slogans and good news. When the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams arrived, the revolutionary teachers and students sang and danced enthusiastically to welcome them into the schools. In recent days, the army's leftist support personnel have gone deep into the revolutionary students and teachers and staff, through heart-to-heart talks, discussions, and holding reporting meetings. They linked the model actions of the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, vigorously praised the working class's deep class feelings of loyalty to Chairman Mao and the excellent qualities of the working class. Many revolutionary youngsters excitedly said: The working class's feelings for Chairman Mao are even deeper than ours, and their loyalty to Chairman Mao is even stronger than ours. We must put down our airs and humbly learn from the working class and accept the leadership of the working class.

The broad ranks of leftist support personnel regard defending the leadership of the working class as a matter of principle regarding loyalty to Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They enthusiastically support the revolutionary initiatives and all revolutionary actions proposed by the worker comrades. As soon as the worker comrades entered the schools, the army comrades who were familiar with the school's situation actively and voluntarily introduced the class struggle situation in the school; when the worker comrades proposed to hold study classes to implement Chairman Mao's latest directive, the army comrades immediately closely cooperated, conducted in-depth investigations and research, formulated plans, and seriously implemented them. The army comrades also, through words and deeds, brought the political building of the army advocated by Vice Chairman Lin, emphasizing proletarian politics, adhering to the four firsts, carrying forward the three-eight style, and promoting the four-good regiment movement, to the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, and widely spread them among the broad revolutionary teachers and students.

The army comrades also followed Chairman Mao's instruction to "never forget class struggle" and were always alert to the enemy's sabotage activities. As soon as the workers' propaganda teams entered the schools, a small handful of class enemies spread rumors and tried to stir up trouble between the workers and the students, and between the workers and the People's Liberation Army. In one school, after the workers' propaganda team entered, a walking capitalist-roaders came out to plead his case. The workers, the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, and the revolutionary teachers and students immediately gave the class enemies a crushing blow, foiling the class enemies' plot to stir up trouble. The army comrades believed that as the struggle deepens, the class enemies will inevitably struggle desperately. We must be alert to the class enemies using sugar-coated bullets and other means to sabotage and attack us. Everyone unanimously expressed that they must play the role of the pillar of proletarian dictatorship, vowing to be the strong backbone of the working class, and together with the worker comrades, revolutionary students, and teachers and staff, thoroughly smash all the class enemies' sabotage plots and ensure the victory of the proletarian cultural revolution.

Humbleness in Learning from the Working Class

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Only the working class has the foresight, selflessness, and thoroughness of revolution." The army comrades regard this opportunity to work with the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams entering the schools as the best chance to learn from the working class. They said, the worker comrades participating in the propaganda teams this time include those who are active in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, those who have come out of the struggle between the two lines, those who have been tempered in long-term class struggle, and those who are advanced producers and technical innovators. They have rich practical experience in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation. This time, being able to study the latest directive with them, carry out the cultural revolution with them, fight against the enemy with them, and do political and ideological work with them, we can most vividly and practically learn their good thoughts and good styles. The army's leftist support personnel stationed in Shanghai Music Academy, Jiaotong University, and Fudan University said, the working class has the most revolutionary firmness and thoroughness, daring to think, dare to speak, dare to do, and dare to pioneer. We must humbly learn from the working class, keep their good thoughts and good styles in mind, and truly learn them. We are determined to be like the working class, forever loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

The army comrades also realized that working with the worker comrades to carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the schools is a new topic, and they will inevitably encounter many difficulties. They must follow Chairman Mao's instruction on "practice, knowledge, practice again, knowledge again" and continuously learn, practice, and summarize. The army's leftist support personnel stationed in Shanghai Drama Academy and other colleges and universities have all formulated learning plans. In addition to studying with the workers in the revolutionary teachers and students' study classes, they have also formulated their own learning systems, studying Chairman Mao's latest directive, carrying out criticism of self and revisionism, and carrying out their own ideological revolutionization. They proudly declared: They will definitely, together with the worker comrades, through the practice of the cultural revolution, transform the objective world according to the image of the working class, and at the same time transform their subjective world, and let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought forever fly high on the educational front.

    工人阶级必须领导一切
    作工人阶级的后盾　在教育革命中立新功
    进驻上海大专院校的解放军决心配合工人毛泽东思想宣传队搞好学校的斗批改
    新华社上海二十九日电　根据伟大领袖毛主席的伟大战略部署，在上海市革命委员会的领导下，人民解放军驻上海陆海空部队积极抽调大批支左人员，配合以上海产业工人为主体的工人毛泽东思想宣传队，到二十七日为止，已进入了全市二十六所大专院校。广大指战员怀着对毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情，决心在工人阶级的领导下，配合宣传队的工人群众，同学校中的学生、教员、工人中的积极分子一起，搞好革命的三结合，在伟大的斗、批、改高潮中，在无产阶级教育革命中为人民立新功。
        伟大光荣的政治任务
    伟大领袖毛主席“要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用”的最新指示发表后，驻沪三军支左人员，立即纷纷举办毛泽东思想学习班，认真学习毛主席的最新指示，为配合工人毛泽东思想宣传队开进大专院校作好准备。姚文元同志的重要文章传达了毛主席的最新指示：“实现无产阶级教育革命，必须有工人阶级领导，必须有工人群众参加，配合解放军战士，同学校的学生、教员、工人中决心把无产阶级教育革命进行到底的积极分子实行革命的三结合。工人宣传队要在学校中长期留下去，参加学校中全部斗、批、改任务，并且永远领导学校。在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校。”广大指战员立即闻风而动，一边学习，一边组织力量，和产业工人大军一起，浩浩荡荡地开进大专院校。他们说：毛主席把这样光荣伟大的政治任务交给我们，这是对我们的最大信任，最大鼓舞，我们决不辜负毛主席的期望。
    在大批工人宣传队进入学校的新形势下，许多同工人宣传队共同战斗的解放军支左人员，以“怎样更好地在学校中完成支左任务”为题，联系自己的思想，对照毛主席的最新指示，展开了热烈讨论。大家深刻认识到，要全面占领那些被资产阶级知识分子把持的教育阵地，把文权牢牢地掌握在工人阶级手里，搞好学校的斗、批、改，把学校办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校，这是无产阶级向资产阶级堡垒冲击的一场硬仗，部队支左的任务更重了，我们一定要打好这一仗。大家进一步分析了完成这一光荣任务的有利条件，满怀胜利的信心说：我们有伟大统帅毛主席的英明领导，有毛主席最新指示这个威力无比的精神原子弹，有强大的工人宣传队，有革命的红卫兵小将和革命教职员工的支持，在这一场伟大的战斗中，我们也一定能打好这一仗，不获全胜，决不收兵。
    誓作工人阶级的坚强后盾
    为了使学校广大革命师生紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，迅速落实毛主席的最新指示，一进学校，部队同志就和工人宣传队同志一起，广泛举办毛泽东思想学习班，帮助革命师生深入学习毛主席的最新指示，提高他们对工人阶级领导作用的认识，克服一部分师生中轻视工农等各种错误思想。交通大学在工人宣传队进校前，在交大的部队支左人员就协助革命师生举办了毛泽东思想学习班，大讲毛主席最新指示的伟大意义，大颂工人阶级的伟大功勋，大摆工人阶级领导无产阶级教育革命的必要性和伟大意义。不少学校还出大批判专栏，批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人排斥工农，破坏工人阶级领导教育的罪行。通过大学习，大批判，使革命师生对工人毛泽东思想宣传队进校有了正确的认识，他们把工人进学校看作大喜事，积极排练节目，打扫环境卫生，张贴欢迎标语、喜报。当工人毛泽东思想宣传队一来，革命师生就载歌载舞，热烈地把他们迎进学校。连日来，部队的支左人员纷纷深入到革命学生和教职员工中去，通过谈心、座谈、举行讲用会，联系工人毛泽东思想宣传队中的模范行动，大力颂扬工人阶级无限忠于毛主席的深厚阶级感情和工人阶级的优秀品质。许多革命小将激动地说：工人阶级对毛主席的感情就是比我们深，跟毛主席就是比我们紧，我们一定要放下架子，恭恭敬敬地向工人阶级学习，接受工人阶级的领导。
    广大支左人员把捍卫工人阶级的领导，看作是对毛主席和毛主席革命路线忠不忠的原则问题。他们热情支持工人同志提出的革命倡议和一切革命行动。工人同志一进学校，熟悉学校情况的部队同志，就积极主动地介绍学校阶级斗争的情况；工人同志提出要大办落实毛主席最新指示的学习班，部队同志立即紧密配合，深入调查研究，制定计划，认真落实。部队同志还通过言传身带，把林副主席倡导的部队活学活用毛泽东思想，突出无产阶级政治，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风，开展四好连队运动等政治建军优良传统，带到工人毛泽东思想宣传队，在广大革命师生中广泛传播。
    部队同志还遵照毛主席关于“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，时刻警惕阶级敌人的破坏活动。工人宣传队一进入学校，一小撮阶级敌人就散布流言蜚语，妄图挑拨工人与学生、工人与解放军之间的关系。有一个学校的走资派，在工人宣传队进校后，就跳出来为自己翻案。工人、解放军战士和革命师生立即给阶级敌人以迎头痛击，粉碎了阶级敌人挑拨离间的阴谋。部队同志认为，随着斗争的深入，阶级敌人必然会进行垂死的挣扎，我们必须警惕阶级敌人用糖衣炮弹和其他手段，对我们进行破坏和袭击。大家一致表示，一定要发挥无产阶级专政柱石的作用，誓作工人阶级的坚强后盾，和工人同志、革命学生、教职员工一起，彻底粉碎阶级敌人的一切破坏阴谋，保证无产阶级教育革命胜利进行。
  虚心向工人
    阶级学习
    毛主席教导我们：“只有工人阶级最有远见，大公无私，最富于革命的彻底性。”部队同志把这次同工人毛泽东思想宣传队进驻学校看作向工人阶级学习的最好机会。他们说，这次参加宣传队的工人同志，有的是活学活用毛泽东思想的积极分子，有的是从两条路线斗争中“杀”出来的革命闯将，有的是经历过长期阶级斗争锻炼的老工人，有的是先进生产者和技术革新能手，他们有丰富的阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动的实践经验。这次能和他们一起学习最新指示，一起搞教育革命，一起搞对敌斗争，一起做政治思想工作，就能最生动、最实际地把他们的好思想、好作风学到手。进驻上海音乐学院、交通大学和复旦大学等大专院校的部队支左人员说，工人阶级最有革命的坚定性和彻底性，敢想、敢说、敢干、敢闯，我们一定要虚心地向工人阶级学习，把他们的好思想、好作风，看在眼里，记在心里，真正学到手，决心象工人阶级那样，永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的革命路线。
    部队同志还认识到，和工人同志一起，搞好学校的斗、批、改，是一个崭新的课题，必然会遇到很多困难，一定要按照毛主席关于“实践、认识、再实践、再认识”的教导，不断学习，不断实践，不断总结。进驻上海戏剧学院等大专院校的部队支左人员，都制定了学习计划，除了和工人一起参加革命师生的学习班学习外，还制定了自己的学习制度，学习毛主席的最新指示，进行斗私批修，搞好自己的思想革命化。他们豪迈地表示：一定和工人同志一起，通过教育革命的实践，按照工人阶级的面貌改造客观世界，并在改造客观世界的同时改造自己的主观世界，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗在教育阵地上永远高高飘扬。
