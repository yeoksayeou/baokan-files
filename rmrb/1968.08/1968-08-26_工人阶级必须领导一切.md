A great tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation is approaching. The publication of Chairman Mao's latest instructions signals the arrival of this tide, as the vast army of industrial workers, with leadership and in an orderly manner, advances into schools and other units where the struggle, criticism, and transformation have not yet been thoroughly carried out. This tide follows a series of tasks, including the establishment of revolutionary committees at the provincial, municipal, and autonomous region levels, the launching of a great criticism, and the cleansing of class ranks, among others. It will bring about profound changes in all fields, fiercely assaulting all superstructures that do not conform to the socialist economic base, educating the broad masses, smashing the hidden reactionaries, and leading to the complete victory of the Cultural Revolution, thereby greatly promoting the development of the productive forces of society.

The immediate task for revolutionary committees at all levels is to seize the opportunity to thoroughly carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation. To accomplish this task, we must insist on the leadership of the working class and "fully play the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all other work."

Since the mid-19th century, when Marxism began to take shape, the call to replace bourgeois dictatorship with proletarian dictatorship has been raised. Today, 120 years have passed. Only imperialists, landlords, bourgeoisie, and their agents, the old and new revisionists, oppose this thoroughly revolutionary slogan. The Communist Party of China has taken this slogan as its fundamental program. To realize this slogan, we must unite the broad masses outside the working class, mainly the peasant masses, the urban petty bourgeoisie, and the intellectuals who can be reformed, and lead them forward.

The entire process of the Cultural Revolution is carried out under the leadership of the working class alone. Our Party is the vanguard of the proletariat. The proletarian headquarters, with Chairman Mao at the core and Vice Chairman Lin as his deputy, is the concentrated representative of the interests of the working class, poor and lower-middle peasants, and the broad laboring masses. It is the sole leadership center for the entire Party, the entire army, the entire nation, and the broad revolutionary people. Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and his various instructions reflect the urgent demands of the working class and the hundreds of millions of revolutionary people, embodying the firm leadership of the proletariat over the entire Cultural Revolution. It is under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters, with Chairman Mao at the core, that such a great Cultural Revolution involving hundreds of millions of revolutionary people has been launched. To insist on the leadership of the working class, we must first ensure that every instruction from the great leader of the working class, Chairman Mao, and every order from the highest command of the working class are swiftly and smoothly carried out. We must oppose the "multi-center is no-center" theory, regionalism, sectarianism, and all other bourgeois reactionary tendencies that undermine the leadership of the working class. Revolutionary committees at all levels are organs of proletarian dictatorship, and all units should accept the leadership of the revolutionary committees. In our country, no large or small "independent kingdoms" that oppose the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao are allowed to exist. The old Beijing Municipal Committee's "independent kingdom," which resisted Chairman Mao's instructions and was impervious to any outside influence, was a tool used by China's Khrushchev and his gang of conspirators to oppose the leadership of the working class and carry out capitalist restoration. This "independent kingdom" has been thoroughly smashed by the revolutionary storm. Its lessons in class struggle should be learned by all revolutionaries. The citizens of all the large and small "independent kingdoms" controlled by bourgeois elements across the country should also study these lessons.

The entry of worker propaganda teams into the educational front is a momentous event. Since ancient times, schools have been monopolized by the exploiting classes and their offspring. After liberation, things improved somewhat, but basically, they were still monopolized by bourgeois intellectuals. Some students who graduated from these schools, due to various reasons (these reasons are probably: either the individual was good, or the teacher was good, or they were influenced by their family, relatives, friends, and mainly by society), were able to integrate with the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serve them. However, some were not. In a proletarian dictatorship country, there is a serious phenomenon of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat vying for leadership. In this Cultural Revolution, the Red Guards rose up to rebel against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, and the reactionary forces in the schools temporarily suffered a heavy blow. But soon, some people began to secretly stir up trouble, inciting the masses to fight each other, sabotaging the Cultural Revolution, sabotaging the struggle, criticism, and transformation, sabotaging the great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, and sabotaging the cleansing of class ranks and the rectification of the Party. This situation has caused widespread dissatisfaction among the masses. The reality tells us that under such circumstances, relying solely on students and intellectuals cannot complete the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation on the educational front, as well as other series of tasks. Workers and soldiers must participate, and there must be strong leadership from the working class.

Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "To carry out the proletarian education revolution, there must be leadership from the working class, and there must be participation from the working masses. They must work together with the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and the active elements among the students, teachers, and workers in the schools who are determined to carry the proletarian education revolution through to the end. The worker propaganda teams must stay in the schools for a long time to participate in all the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and to lead the schools permanently. In the countryside, the schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants."

Chairman Mao's instructions point out the direction and path for the education revolution in schools, serving as a sharp weapon to thoroughly smash the bourgeois education system. Broad masses of young students should enthusiastically welcome the working class to occupy the school front, participate in the struggle, criticism, and transformation, and lead the schools permanently.

The working class has rich practical experience in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment. The working class hates all anti-socialist and anti-Mao Zedong Thought counter-revolutionary words and deeds the most, detests the old education system that serves the exploiting classes the most, opposes the "civil war" actions of some intellectuals that sabotage state property and obstruct the struggle, criticism, and transformation the most, and despises the hypocritical habit of empty talk and the two-faced attitude the most. Therefore, the working class masses, together with the mainstay of proletarian dictatorship—the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, can most effectively stop all erroneous tendencies that deviate from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and most effectively solve various so-called "hard nuts." Contradictions that intellectuals cannot solve quickly are solved by workers. The handful of bad elements hiding behind the scenes and inciting the masses to fight each other can only have their counter-revolutionary faces thoroughly exposed under the participation of workers and soldiers.

"The workers only need to manage the factories." This is an anti-Marxist viewpoint. The working class knows: only by liberating all humanity can they ultimately liberate themselves. If the proletarian education revolution in the schools is not thoroughly carried out and the roots of revisionism are not uprooted, the working class will not be ultimately liberated, there will be the danger of capitalist restoration, and there will be the danger of being exploited and oppressed again. Actively participating in the Cultural Revolution in all fields and occupying all cultural and educational fronts with Mao Zedong Thought is the responsibility that the awakened working class should bear.

"We must liberate ourselves; we do not need workers from outside the school to participate." The "Sixteen Points" say "the masses must liberate themselves." Are workers not "the masses"? Is the working class not "ourselves"? All true proletarian revolutionaries, not those who merely talk but deceive, regard the working class as "ourselves" and as the most advanced and conscious part of the people. The combination of workers, soldiers, and active revolutionary elements in the schools is the most reliable guarantee for the masses to liberate themselves. Those who regard workers as an alien force outside "ourselves" are either confused or themselves class aliens of the working class, and the working class has the right to seize their power. Some intellectuals who proclaim themselves as "proletarian revolutionaries" oppose workers as soon as their small "independent kingdoms" are touched. Such "dragon-loving" figures are still numerous in China. These people are those who despise workers and peasants, love to put on airs, and think they are great, but in reality, they are just modern "dragon-lovers." Wherever there are gatherings of intellectuals, whether in schools or other units, workers and soldiers must advance in, break the monopoly of intellectuals, occupy those large and small "independent kingdoms," and occupy the places where the "multi-center is no-center" theorists are entrenched. In this way, the unhealthy atmosphere, style, and ideas among the gatherings of intellectuals can be changed, and they can be reformed and liberated.

"Workers do not understand education." Some so-called "high-level intellectuals" say this. Put away your bourgeois intellectual airs! There are two kinds of education: bourgeois education and proletarian education. The "knowledge" you "understand" is the false "scholarship" of the bourgeoisie. Those who teach engineering do not know how to operate and repair machines, those who teach literature do not know how to write articles, and those who teach agricultural chemistry do not understand how to apply fertilizer. Such jokes are everywhere. The proletarian education system, which unites theory with practice, can only be gradually created under the direct participation of the proletariat. You are completely ignorant of this.

"Workers do not understand the situation in the schools and do not understand the history of the struggle between the two lines." Comrade, do not be anxious; workers will understand. The working class is far more advanced than those short-sighted intellectuals who only see their own small hill. They are not staying for three or five days but will work long-term, permanently occupying and leading the schools. All objectively existing things can be recognized, and the working class will, through their revolutionary practice, gain a deeper understanding of the world and change the world in the image of the working class.

Worker propaganda teams should, step by step and in a planned manner, go to primary, secondary, and higher schools, to various fields of the superstructure, and to all units where the struggle, criticism, and transformation have not yet been thoroughly carried out. With Mao Zedong Thought as the guide, they should unite and help those who are determined to carry the proletarian education revolution through to the end, unite with the majority of the masses, including intellectuals who can be reformed, and promote the struggle, criticism, and transformation there with the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat. This is a great historical mission for the Chinese working class at present. In this process, the working class itself will undergo profound tempering in class struggle, producing a batch of excellent worker cadres who will be sent to various aspects of state organs and revolutionary committees at all levels, not just to manage schools.

To complete this historical mission, the working class must seriously study Mao Zedong Thought, learn the mass line and the style of investigation and study that Chairman Mao has always advocated, continuously improve their political consciousness, strengthen revolutionary discipline, and continuously criticize the infiltration and influence of various bourgeois decadent styles within the working class. In cultural and educational units, the bourgeoisie has its traditional forces. When the working class uses the proletarian worldview, namely Mao Zedong Thought, to change the world, the bourgeoisie always tries to use their bourgeois worldview to corrupt the working class, including the weak parts of their leadership. This must be highly vigilant. A firm proletarian stance must be maintained. Be vigilant against the sugar-coated bullets or other forms of attacks on the working class. The cleansing of class ranks must also be done seriously, and the revolution must be promoted to advance production, and the struggle, criticism, and transformation in factories and enterprises must be done well.

Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "Establish revolutionary committees with the three-in-one combination, carry out great criticism, cleanse class ranks, rectify the Party, streamline organizations, reform unreasonable regulations, transfer office staff, and in factories, go through the stages of struggle, criticism, and transformation."

Chairman Mao's words are a summary of the development of the mass movement in the struggle, criticism, and transformation stages, pointing out a clear path for us to complete the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation in factories and enterprises.

The first task is to establish revolutionary committees with the three-in-one combination, so that the leadership of factories and enterprises is truly in the hands of the proletariat. This is often done in conjunction with the tasks of great criticism and the general cleansing of class ranks.

The revolutionary mass criticism clears away the poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of China's Khrushchev and his agents in various places, raises the awareness of the struggle between the two lines, paves the way politically and ideologically for the cleansing of class ranks, and plays a role in mobilizing the masses and consolidating the results of the struggle during the cleansing of class ranks. The cleansing of class ranks, accurately and firmly striking a small handful of spies, traitors, unrepentant capitalist roaders, and unrepentant landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, is a very important task for the working class to exercise proletarian dictatorship, purify their own ranks, and eliminate class enemies who have infiltrated. It provides vivid materials for the great criticism. The two promote and drive each other. The great criticism and the cleansing of class ranks create the best conditions for the rectification of the Party. After undergoing strict class struggle tests politically, ideologically, and organizationally, the political consciousness of the broad Party members has been greatly improved, their relationship with the masses has been greatly improved, a small number of bad elements within the Party have been expelled, the political and organizational situation of Party members has been basically clarified, and a batch of active elements who have emerged in the movement have been absorbed into the Party organization, injecting new blood into the Party. A leadership core that firmly implements Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is gradually formed, thus enabling us to rectify the Party organization and achieve the great goal of Party rectification pointed out by Chairman Mao: "The Party organization should be composed of advanced elements of the proletariat and should be a vigorous vanguard organization that can lead the proletariat and revolutionary masses to fight against the class enemy."

The movement in factories and enterprises is like this, and in cultural and educational undertakings, in Party and government organs, the movement is also roughly like this.

The revolutionary high tide promotes the high tide of production. Due to the efforts of tens of millions of poor and lower-middle peasants, China's agricultural production has had a bumper harvest for many years. With a solid socialist position in the countryside, the Cultural Revolution in the cities can achieve victory after victory. We pay tribute to the solid ally of the working class, the poor and lower-middle peasants. As the struggle, criticism, and transformation deepens, many new things are emerging on the industrial front, and many places have seen a thriving technological revolution during the transformation process. The situation is excellent and inspiring. A small handful of class enemies who dream of restoration are doomed to failure. Now, the days of the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and all reactionaries in the world are not good. They are in a state of panic, disintegrating, and have nowhere to go. Under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, our great socialist motherland, tempered by the Cultural Revolution, is brilliant and has a boundless future. We must strive to keep up with the developing situation, fully mobilize the masses, timely summarize experiences, do a good job of investigation and study, grasp typical cases, plan comprehensively, strengthen leadership, and seriously fight the battle of struggle, criticism, and transformation. This is a battle in our struggle for the complete victory of the Cultural Revolution. Let us follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and advance victoriously!

    工人阶级必须领导一切
    姚文元
    一个伟大的斗、批、改的高潮正在到来。毛主席最新指示的发表，浩浩荡荡的产业工人大军有领导、有步骤地开进学校和其他一切还没有搞好斗、批、改的单位，是这个高潮到来的信号。这个高潮，是经过成立各省、市、自治区革命委员会、大批判、清理阶级队伍等等一系列工作之后出现的，它将在各个领域中引起深刻的变革，猛烈地冲击一切不适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑，教育广大人民，粉碎暗藏的反动派，引向无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，大大促进社会生产力的发展。
    放在各级革命委员会当前的重大任务，就是不失时机地认真搞好斗、批、改。完成这个任务，必须坚持工人阶级领导，“充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。”
    自从十九世纪中期马克思主义开始形成的时候起，就提出用无产阶级专政代替资产阶级专政的口号，到今天已经一百二十年了。只有帝国主义、地主阶级、资产阶级及其代理人新老修正主义者才反对这个彻底革命的口号。中国共产党是以这个口号为其基本纲领的。而要实现这个口号，就要联合工人以外的广大群众，这主要是农民群众、城市小资产阶级群众以及有可能改造的知识分子，并领导他们前进。
    无产阶级文化大革命的整个过程，仅仅是在工人阶级这个唯一的阶级领导下进行的。我们的党是无产阶级的先锋队。以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，是工人阶级、贫下中农和广大劳动群众的利益的集中代表者，是全党、全军、全国和广大革命人民唯一的领导中心。毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，毛主席的各项指示，都反映了工人阶级和亿万革命人民的迫切要求，体现了无产阶级对整个无产阶级文化大革命的坚强领导。正是在以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部领导下，才能发动这样一场亿万革命群众参加的无产阶级文化大革命。坚持工人阶级的领导，首先要保证工人阶级的伟大领袖毛主席的每一个指示，工人阶级的最高战斗指挥部的每一个号令，都能迅速地畅通地贯彻执行。必须反对
  “多中心即无中心论”、山头主义、宗派主义等种种破坏工人阶级领导的资产阶级反动倾向。各地革命委员会是无产阶级专政的权力机构，各单位都应当接受革命委员会的领导。我们国家中，不允许存在与毛主席的无产阶级司令部相对抗的任何大的或小的“独立王国”。旧北京市委那种抗拒毛主席指示、针插不进、水泼不进的“独立王国”，是中国赫鲁晓夫等一伙大阴谋家对抗工人阶级领导、进行资本主义复辟的手段。这个“独立王国”已被革命的风暴彻底摧毁了。它的阶级斗争的历史教训，应为一切革命者所记取。全国各地那些被资产阶级分子所把持的大大小小的独立王国里的公民们，也应当研究这个教训。
    工人宣传队进入教育阵地，这是一件惊天动地的大事。自古以来，学校这个地方，就是为剥削阶级及其子女所垄断。解放以后，好了一些，但基本上还是被资产阶级知识分子所垄断。从这些学校出来的学生，有些人由于各种原因（这些原因大概是：或本人比较好，或教师比较好，或受了家庭、亲戚、朋友的影响，而主要的是受社会的影响）能同工农兵结合，为工农兵服务，有一些人则不能。在无产阶级专政的国家内，存在着资产阶级与无产阶级争夺领导权的严重现象。在这场无产阶级文化大革命中，红卫兵小将奋起造党内一小撮走资派的反，学校中的资产阶级反动势力暂时地遭到了一次沉重的打击。但随后不久，有些人又暗地活动起来，挑动群众斗群众，破坏文化大革命，破坏斗、批、改，破坏大联合和革命的三结合，破坏清理阶级队伍的工作和整党的工作。这种情况引起了广大群众的不满。现实的状况告诉我们：在这种情况下，单靠学生、知识分子不能完成教育战线的斗、批、改、及其他一系列任务，必须有工人、解放军参加，必须有工人阶级的坚强领导。
    毛主席最近指出：“实现无产阶级教育革命，必须有工人阶级领导，必须有工人群众参加，配合解放军战士，同学校的学生、教员、工人中决心把无产阶级教育革命进行到底的积极分子实行革命的三结合。工人宣传队要在学校中长期留下去，参加学校中全部斗、批、改任务，并且永远领导学校。在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校。”
    毛主席这个指示，指出了学校教育革命的方向和道路，是彻底摧毁资产阶级教育制度的锐利的武器。广大青年学生，要热烈欢迎工人阶级占领学校阵地，参加斗、批、改，并且永远领导学校。
    工人阶级有阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命运动的丰富的实践经验，工人阶级最仇恨一切反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的反革命言行，最痛恨为剥削阶级服务的旧教育制度，最反对某些知识分子破坏国家财产、阻碍斗、批、改的“打内战”行动，最讨厌言行不一的空谈习气和两面派作风。所以，工人阶级群众同无产阶级专政的主要支柱——中国人民解放军的战士相结合，能够最有力地制止一切违反毛主席革命路线的错误倾向，最有效地解决种种所谓“老大难”的问题。知识分子纠缠不休不能解决的矛盾，工人们一到，很快就解决了。隐藏在幕后挑动群众斗群众的一小撮坏人，只有在工人、解放军的参预下，才能把他们的反革命面貌彻底揭发出来。
      “工人只要管工厂就够了。”这是反马克思主义的观点。工人阶级懂得：只有解放全人类，才能最后解放自己。不把学校中的无产阶级教育革命搞彻底，不挖掉修正主义根子，工人阶级就不能最后得到解放，就有资本主义复辟的危险，就有重新被剥削被压迫的危险。积极参加各个领域的文化大革命，用毛泽东思想占领一切文化教育阵地，是有觉悟的工人阶级应当肩负的责任。
      “我们要自己解放自己，不需要校外的工人参加。”《十六条》说的是“群众自己解放自己”。难道工人不算“群众”？难道工人阶级不算“自己”？一切真正的而非口头说说骗人的无产阶级革命派都把工人阶级当作“自己”人，当作人民群众中最先进、最有觉悟的一部分人。工人、战士、学校中革命的积极分子“三结合”，就是群众自己解放自己最可靠的保证。那种把工人当作“自己”以外的异己力量的人，如果不是糊涂，他自己就是工人阶级的阶级异己分子，工人阶级就有理由专他的政。有些自己宣布自己为“无产阶级革命派”的知识分子，一遇到工人阶级触动他那个小小的“独立王国”的利益的时候，就反对起工人来了。这种叶公好龙式的人物，在中国还是不少的。这种人就是所谓轻视工农、爱摆架子、自以为了不起的人物，而其实不过是现代的一批叶公而已。凡是知识分子成堆的地方，不论是学校，还是别的单位，都应有工人、解放军开进去，打破知识分子独霸的一统天下，占领那些大大小小的“独立王国”，占领那些“多中心即无中心”论者盘踞的地方。这样，成堆的知识分子中间的不健康的空气、作风和想法就可以改变，他们也就有可能得到改造和解放。
      “工人不懂教育。”某些所谓“高级知识分子”这样说。还是收起你那一套资产阶级知识分子臭架子吧！有两种教育：资产阶级教育和无产阶级教育。你们“懂”的是资产阶级那一套假“学问”，教理工科的不会开机器和修机器，教文学的不会写文章，教农业化学的不懂得施肥料，这样的笑话不是到处都有吗？理论与实践一致的无产阶级的教育制度，只能在无产阶级的直接参加下才能逐步创造出来，你们于此是一窍不通的。
      “工人不了解学校情况，不了解两条路线斗争的历史。”同志，不要着急，工人是会了解的。工人阶级比那些目光短浅、只看到自己一个小山头的知识分子，水平不知道高出多少。他们不是住三、五天，而要长期工作下去，要永远占领学校和领导学校。一切客观存在的事物都是可以被认识的，工人阶级将会通过自己的革命实践更深刻地认识世界，并按照工人阶级的面貌改造世界。
    工人宣传队要有步骤、有计划地到大、中、小学去，到上层建筑各个领域中去，到一切还没有搞好斗、批、改的单位去，以毛泽东思想为指针，团结、帮助那里决心把无产阶级教育革命进行到底的积极分子，联合大多数群众，包括有可能改造的知识分子，用无产阶级的彻底革命精神，促进那里的斗、批、改。这是中国工人阶级当前一项伟大的历史使命。在这个过程中，工人阶级本身会受到深刻的阶级斗争锻炼，涌现出一批优秀的工人干部，充实到国家机关的各个方面以及各级革委会里去，不但管理学校而已。
    为了完成这个历史任务，工人阶级必须认真学好毛泽东思想，学习毛主席历来教导的群众路线和调查研究的作风，不断提高自己的政治觉悟，加强革命的纪律性，不断批判工人阶级内部各种资产阶级腐朽作风的侵蚀及影响。在文化教育单位，资产阶级有它的传统势力。在工人阶级要用无产阶级世界观即毛泽东思想改造世界时，资产阶级总是力图用他们的资产阶级世界观来腐蚀工人队伍包括其领导干部中的薄弱部分。对此必须有高度的警惕。必须保持坚定的无产阶级立场。必须警惕糖衣炮弹或其它形式的手段对工人队伍的袭击。还要认真地做好清理阶级队伍工作，抓革命、促生产，搞好工厂企业的斗、批、改。
    毛主席最近指出：“建立三结合的革命委员会，大批判，清理阶级队伍，整党，精简机构、改革不合理的规章制度、下放科室人员，工厂里的斗、批、改，大体经历这么几个阶段。”
    毛主席的这段话，是对斗、批、改阶段群众运动发展的总结，为我们完成工厂企业斗、批、改的任务指出了明确的道路。
    首先的任务是建立三结合的革命委员会，使工厂企业的领导权真正掌握在无产阶级手里。这往往是同大批判和大体上清理阶级队伍两项任务结合起来做的。
    革命的群众性的大批判，使人们清除了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在各地代理人的反革命修正主义路线的毒害，提高了两条路线斗争觉悟，从政治上、思想上为清理阶级队伍开路，并且在清理阶级队伍的过程中，起着发动群众、巩固斗争成果的作用。清理阶级队伍，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮特务、叛徒、死不悔改的走资派和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，是工人阶级向资产阶级和一切剥削阶级进行无产阶级专政、纯洁自己队伍、清除钻到内部来的阶级敌人的一件十分重要的工作，它为大批判提供了生动的活材料。两者相互促进、相互推动。大批判和清理阶级队伍，为整党创造了最好的条件。经过政治上、思想上、组织上阶级斗争的严格考验，广大党员的政治觉悟有了很大提高，同群众的关系有了很大的改进，党内的极少数坏人清除出去了，党员的政治状况、组织状况基本上弄清楚了，并且吸收一批在运动中涌现出来的积极分子参加党组织，使党增加新鲜血液，逐步形成一个坚决执行毛主席无产阶级革命路线的领导核心，这样，我们就能整顿好党的组织，我们就能实现毛主席指出的伟大整党目标：“党组织应是无产阶级先进分子所组成，应能领导无产阶级和革命群众对于阶级敌人进行战斗的朝气蓬勃的先锋队组织。”
    在工矿企业中的运动是如此，在文化教育事业中，在党、政机关中的运动，也大体是如此。
    革命的高潮推动着生产的高潮。由于几万万贫下中农努力，我国农业生产多年获得丰收。有了一个巩固的农村的社会主义阵地，才能使城市中的无产阶级文化大革命节节胜利。我们向工人阶级的巩固的同盟军贫下中农致敬。随着斗、批、改的深入开展，工业战线上也在涌现出许多新事物，不少地方已在改的过程中出现了蓬蓬勃勃的技术革命。形势大好，振奋人心，一小撮妄想复辟的阶级敌人彻底完蛋了。现在美帝、苏修和世界上一切反动派的日子很不好过，他们焦头烂额，分崩离析，走投无路。在毛泽东同志领导下的经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的我们伟大的社会主义祖国，则是光辉灿烂，前途无量。我们一定要努力跟上发展着的形势，充分发动群众，及时总结经验，做好调查研究，抓好典型，全面规划，加强领导，认真打好斗、批、改这一仗。这是我们夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利中的一仗，让我们紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署乘胜前进！
