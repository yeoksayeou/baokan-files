The red sun shines brightly, illuminating the entire world. Red flags flutter, and songs of joy fill the air. A spring thunder roars across the five continents, and the joyous news spreads far and wide.

	(White) Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "To achieve the proletarian educational revolution, it is necessary to have the leadership of the working class, the participation of the working masses, and to combine with the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. Together with the students, teachers, and workers in the schools who are determined to carry the proletarian educational revolution to the end, we must implement the revolutionary three-in-one combination. The worker propaganda teams must stay in the schools for a long time, participate in all the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and forever lead the schools. In the countryside, the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants—should manage the schools." The latest directives are brilliant and weighty, each word carrying immense significance. They sound the drums of progress and illuminate the path of revolution. They give the working class the greatest encouragement and tell us that the working class is the leading force. The working class has the reddest hearts, the brightest eyes, the most united ranks, the most noble qualities, the firmest steps, and the highest spirits. The working class is the leading class, the vanguard of the revolution. In the Cultural Revolution, the working class sets an example everywhere. When Chairman Mao says to charge, we charge; when Chairman Mao says to advance, we advance. Every new directive from Chairman Mao is carried out to the letter; every strategic deployment from Chairman Mao is followed closely. The red flag of great unity is held high, and the drums of criticism are beaten loudly; the three-in-one combination bravely takes the lead, and the heavy burden of struggle, criticism, and transformation is shouldered. Fearless of storms and waves, we raise our battle flags, wield our swords, march forward bravely, and sing songs of victory. We have overthrown the capitalist roaders within the party, swept away all the wolves that harm the people; we have destroyed the command of the bourgeoisie and smashed all the demons and monsters! Chairman Mao has issued new directives, giving the working class boundless strength. The working class must lead everything, and the working class can shoulder the responsibility. The educational revolution must be led by the working class; the seal of proletarian dictatorship must be held by the working class. The working class listens most to Chairman Mao's words and can best grasp Mao Zedong Thought. Wherever the working class fights, there is a new situation. The working class leads the revolution, and the revolution is sure to win; the working class promotes production, and the songs of victory echo everywhere. The working class leads the educational revolution, and the flowers of the educational revolution bloom! The working class stands tall and sees clearly. The working class is good because of its loyalty. Loyal to Chairman Mao, with a red heart and unyielding will; loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, with boundless strength; loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, fearless of winds and waves. Revolutionary factions, Red Guards, learn from the working class, take the working class as your example, temper your boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, and forever be the vanguard in the storms of class struggle. Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! You are the brightest red sun in our hearts. Your greatest trust in the working class is also your greatest hope for us, the People's Liberation Army. We are determined to fight side by side with the working class, to open a new era in the educational revolution! We will seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, thoroughly bury the revisionist educational line! Turn the schools into red fortresses of Mao Zedong Thought, and let Mao Zedong Thought illuminate the whole world!

    工人阶级是革命主力军（对口词）
    佩琈　晚顺红日高照，普天通亮，红旗漫卷，歌声飞扬。一声春雷震五洲，特大喜讯传四方。
      （白）毛主席最近指出：“实现无产阶级教育革命，必须有工人阶级领导，必须有工人群众参加，配合解放军战士，同学校的学生、教员、工人中决心把无产阶级教育革命进行到底的积极分子实行革命的三结合。工人宣传队要在学校中长期留下去，参加学校中全部斗、批、改任务，并且永远领导学校。在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校。”最新指示，光芒万丈，字字千钧重，句句指方向。它把前进的战鼓擂响，它把革命的航程照亮。它给工人阶级最大的鼓
  舞，它告诉我们工人阶级是领
  导力量。工人阶级心最红，工人阶级眼最亮。队伍最团结，品质最高尚，步伐最坚定，斗志最昂扬。工人阶级是领导阶级，工人阶级是革命主力军，在文化大革命中，工人阶级处处做榜样。毛主席叫冲就冲，毛主席叫闯就闯。毛主席的每一个最新指
    示，句句照办；毛主席的每一个战略部

  力量。工人阶级必须领导一切，工人阶级能够担当。教育革命，工人阶级要管；无产阶级专政大印，工人阶级要掌。工人阶级最听毛主席的
  话，工人阶级最能掌握毛泽东
  思想。工人阶级战斗在那里，那里一片新气象。工人阶级抓革命，革命一定打胜仗；工人阶级促生产，生产凯歌遍地扬。工人阶级抓教育革命，教育革命红花开放！工人阶级顶天立地，工人阶级心明眼亮。工人阶级好，好在“忠”字上。忠于毛主席，心红志更壮；忠于毛泽东思想，浑身有力量；忠于毛主席的革命路线，不怕风和浪。革命派，红小将，向工人阶级学习，以工人阶级为榜样，锤炼对毛主席的无限忠
  心，在阶级斗争的风浪中永当
  闯将。毛主席啊，毛主席！您是我们心中最红最红的
  红太阳。您对工人阶级最大的信
  任，也是对我们解放军的最大
  希望。我们决心和工人阶级并肩
  齐战斗，把教育革命的新纪元开
  创！认真搞好斗、批、改，把修正主义教育路线彻底
  埋葬！把学校办成宣传毛泽东思
  想的红色阵地，让毛泽东思想把全球照
  亮！
