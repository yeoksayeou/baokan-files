Just as the people of the entire nation are enthusiastically celebrating the second anniversary of the publication of the great leader Chairman Mao's "Bombard the Headquarters" big-character poster and the decision made by Chairman Mao personally to formulate the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China Concerning the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," Chairman Mao warmly received us. This is the greatest happiness and greatest honor of our lives. Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! On this joyous occasion, we sincerely wish you, Chairman Mao, eternal life! Eternal life!

Dear Chairman Mao! The proletarian headquarters led by you most concentratedly represents the fundamental interests and revolutionary will of the proletariat and the broad masses of laboring people. It is the sole leadership center for the entire Party, the entire army, the entire nation, and the broad revolutionary masses. The two years of struggle in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have made us deeply realize that only by closely uniting around the proletarian headquarters led by you and acting strictly in accordance with your great battle cry, can we overcome all difficulties, defeat all enemies, and achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

This year in March, just as the revolutionary masses of the Fenglian Coal Mine enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's great call and established revolutionary committees in all units and the twenty-one affiliated mines, a handful of diehard capitalist-roaders, traitors, spies, and unrepentant landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists within the Party launched a frenzied counterattack against the newly established revolutionary committees. They took advantage of the serious bourgeois individualism and factionalism in the minds of some comrades in our revolutionary ranks and used the reactionary theory of bourgeois "multi-centrism" to incite the masses to refuse to carry out the orders and directives issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on "Grasp Revolution, Promote Production." They attempted to overthrow the newly established revolutionary committees and direct their spearheads at the proletarian headquarters, thereby disrupting the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In response to this situation, the members of our revolutionary committee and the comrades of the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, following your great teachings of "Never forget class struggle" and "Must be good at guiding the petty-bourgeois thoughts in our ranks onto the track of proletarian revolution," went deep into the mines. On the one hand, we fully mobilized the masses to carry out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism, exposing a handful of class enemies who conspired to sabotage Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment; on the other hand, we enthusiastically helped comrades who had bourgeois individualism, factionalism, and small-groupism to overcome these erroneous thoughts in study classes. On this basis, the revolutionary situation in our mining area is excellent, and production is booming. The entire system not only completed the national production plan for the first half of the year seven days ahead of schedule but also completed the production task four days ahead of schedule in July.

Dear Chairman Mao! In the future, we will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply your brilliant thoughts, and under the battle cry of the proletarian headquarters led by you, further mobilize the broad revolutionary masses, carry out revolutionary criticism, firmly, accurately, and fiercely strike at a handful of class enemies, strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, do a good job of cleaning up the class ranks, and under the guidance of the proletarian headquarters led by you, forge ahead against the wind and waves and march towards victory!

　　永远团结在毛主席的无产阶级司令部周围
　　北京部队炮兵活学活用毛泽东思想先进集体代表、某部团长、峰峰矿务局革委会主任　薛蕴忠
    正当全国人民热烈欢呼伟大领袖毛主席《炮打司令部》大字报和毛主席亲自主持制定的《中国共产党中央委员会关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》发表两周年的时候，毛主席他老人家亲切地接见了我们，这是我们一生中最大最大的幸福、最大最大的光荣。毛主席啊，毛主席！在这大喜特喜的日子里，我们衷心祝愿您老人家万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    敬爱的毛主席啊！以您为首的无产阶级司令部，最集中地代表了无产阶级和广大劳动人民的根本利益和革命意志，是全党、全军、全国和广大革命群众唯一的领导中心。两年来无产阶级文化大革命的斗争实践，使我们深刻认识到，只有紧紧地团结在以您为首的无产阶级司令部的周围，不折不扣地按照您的伟大战斗号令行动，我们就能克服一切困难，战胜一切敌人，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    今年三月，正当我们峰峰煤矿广大革命群众热烈响应毛主席的伟大号召，在全局和所属二十一个厂矿单位全部建立了革命委员会的时候，党内一小撮死不改悔的走资派、叛徒、特务和没有改造好的地富反坏右分子，疯狂地向新生的革命委员会进行反扑，他们利用我们革命队伍中某些同志头脑中存在的严重资产阶级个人主义和山头主义，利用资产阶级“多中心论”的反动理论，挑动群众拒不执行中共中央发布的关于“抓革命，促生产”的通令和指示，妄图以此来颠覆新生的革命委员会，并把矛头指向无产阶级司令部，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。针对这种情况，我们革委会成员和毛泽东思想宣传队的同志，遵照您老人家“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”，“必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道”的伟大教导，深入矿区，一方面充分发动群众深入持久地开展革命的大批判，把一小撮阴谋破坏毛主席伟大战略部署的阶级敌人揪了出来；另一方面热情帮助那些存在资产阶级个人主义、山头主义、小团体主义思想的同志，在学习班上搞好斗私批修，克服这些错误思想。在这基础上，我们矿区的革命形势一片大好，生产蒸蒸日上。全局不但提前七天超额完成上半年国家生产计划，而且七月份又提前四天完成了生产任务。
    敬爱的毛主席啊！今后，我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，学好用好您的光辉思想，在以您为首的无产阶级司令部的战斗号令下，进一步广泛发动广大革命群众，开展革命的大批判，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人，加强无产阶级专政，做好清理阶级队伍的工作，在以您为首的无产阶级司令部的指引下，乘风破浪，胜利前进！
