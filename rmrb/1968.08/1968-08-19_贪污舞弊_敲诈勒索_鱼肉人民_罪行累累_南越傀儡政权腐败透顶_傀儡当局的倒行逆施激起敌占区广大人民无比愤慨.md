The puppet regime in South Vietnam, propped up by U.S. imperialism, is rotten to the core. The puppet military and government officials collude with each other, engaging in extensive corruption, extortion, and exploitation of the people, amassing wealth through illicit means. The regime's actions have sparked immense outrage among the people in the occupied areas.

According to reports from Saigon, a puppet governor in the Nine Dragons region of South Vietnam bought his position for six million piastres. Upon taking office, he ruthlessly plundered the people's wealth. In less than half a year, he not only recouped the six million piastres but also amassed a fortune. Recently, the puppet regime issued a so-called "total mobilization" decree, further intensifying the conscription of young men into the puppet army to serve as cannon fodder. The puppet military and government officials seized this opportunity to extort money, selling exemption certificates at a high price of ten million piastres each to fill their own pockets. The newspapers revealed that these officials, despite their massive corruption, remain unpunished due to their extensive network of protection.

The puppet military and government officials use their power to engage in speculation and profiteering, which has become a public and "legal" practice. A newspaper in Saigon reported that a deputy governor in the Kien Hoa province sold 2,000 tons of stored rice at a price 33% higher than the market rate, earning a profit of tens of millions of piastres. Moreover, the puppet military and government officials collude with invading U.S. troops to engage in smuggling activities. Recently, eight puppet military officers colluded with two U.S. paratroopers to steal goods worth hundreds of millions of piastres, smuggling them into the homes of the eight officers, who then had their families sell the goods on the black market. The puppet military and government officials also collude with local thugs and gangsters, frequently kidnapping people from various walks of life and demanding ransoms. If the ransom is not paid, the victims are secretly killed. Newspapers in Saigon often report that some kidnapped people, in order to pay the ransom, end up destitute.

Reports indicate that the brutal exploitation by the U.S.-puppet clique has sparked strong resistance from the people in the occupied areas. In the Long An province, thousands of people recently held a rally and march to oppose "powerful corruption," denouncing the puppet military and government officials' extortion of the people. To save face and appease the people, the puppet clique recently replaced a batch of governors and county magistrates who were notorious for their massive corruption. However, the rampant corruption has become an incurable disease for the Saigon puppet regime. Even the puppet leader Nguyen Cao Ky recently admitted that "nine-tenths of the government officials are corrupt." U.S. publications lament that "three-quarters of the aid given to the South Vietnamese puppet government falls into the pockets of corrupt officials," and that the corruption in the South Vietnamese puppet government is "among the worst in the world."

    贪污舞弊　敲诈勒索　鱼肉人民　罪行累累
    南越傀儡政权腐败透顶
    傀儡当局的倒行逆施激起敌占区广大人民无比愤慨
    新华社河内十八日电　西贡消息：美帝国主义一手扶植的南越傀儡政权腐败透顶，伪军政人员狼狈为奸，大肆贪污舞弊，敲诈勒索，恣意鱼肉人民，大发横财。傀儡政权的倒行逆施，激起了敌占区广大人民的无比愤慨。
    据西贡报纸透露，南越九龙地区有一个伪省长，花六百万块钱买了伪省长这个官职。他上任后，疯狂搜刮民脂民膏，不到半年功夫，不仅把这六百万块钱全部捞回，而且积下了万贯家私。最近傀儡政权发布所谓“总动员”法案，变本加厉地强征青壮年参加伪军充当炮灰。伪军政人员抓住这一机会大肆敲诈勒索，他们把免征证件以每张十万元的高价卖出，以填肥自己的私囊。报纸透露，这些伪军政人员虽然贪污巨款，但由于上下勾结，层层庇护，却逍遥法外。
    伪军政人员利用权势，大肆进行投机倒把，牟取暴利，已成为他们公开的“合法”行动。西贡报纸曾透露，庆和省一个伪副省长，以超过市价三分之一的高价倒卖库存大米二千吨，牟取暴利上千万元。不仅如此，伪军政权人员还勾结侵越美军大搞走私活动。不久以前，八名伪军官曾勾结两名侵越美军伞兵，盗取价值数百万元的货物，偷运到这八名伪军官家里，然后由伪军官家属转运入黑市倒卖。南越伪军政人员还同当地的恶棍、流氓相勾结，经常绑架各界人民，威逼以巨金赎领，否则就加以秘密杀害。西贡报纸经常透露，有些被绑架的人民，为了要交出大量赎金，而弄得倾家荡产。
    据报道，美伪集团的残酷压榨，遭到敌占区广大人民的强烈反抗。在隆庆省，不久前有三千多人民举行集会和游行，反对“强权贪污”，控诉伪军政权人员敲诈勒索人民的罪行。傀儡集团为了装潢门面，安抚人心，最近曾故意装模作样地撤换了一批贪污巨款、民愤极大的伪省长、县长。但是贪污舞弊之风盛行，已成为西贡傀儡政权的不治之症。甚至西贡傀儡头子阮高其不久前也招认，“（伪）政府中十分之九的人员都贪污舞弊”。美国报刊悲叹，美国给南越伪政权的“援助”，“有四分之三掉进了贪污者的腰包”，南越伪政权中的贪污舞弊已“名列世界前茅”。
