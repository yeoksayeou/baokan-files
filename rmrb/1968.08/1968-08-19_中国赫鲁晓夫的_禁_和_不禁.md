After the liberation of the entire country, China's Khrushchev was extremely angry about our banning of a batch of reactionary and pornographic books, periodicals, and operas. He bellowed, "Banning one book is like executing one person. Who gave you the authority to ban books!" He ordered, "How many people still read reactionary books? They should be studied, not banned at will." "Promoting feudalism is not to be feared.... Even monks and nuns are not banned, so why ban operas!"

With China's Khrushchev's command to "open up," all sorts of emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties, as well as foreign princesses, princes, and demons, all holding "passes" issued by China's Khrushchev, strutted onto the stage of our socialist society.

China's Khrushchev also said, "If Peking opera is hard to understand, subtitles can be projected. The lyrics should not be changed; the language of that era reflects the thoughts of people of that era." The words spoken by emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties, and the poison they spread, were all not to be touched, not to be changed. China's Khrushchev shouted hoarsely: This should not be "banned" at will, that should not be "changed" at will. So, does he not "ban" anything and not "change" anything? Absolutely not. If the revolutionary people want to criticize old dramas and arts, and create new dramas and arts for socialism, he will definitely ban them severely! Regarding Chairman Mao's wise instructions and the policies of the proletarian literary revolution, he will maliciously distort and viciously alter them! Chairman Mao proposed the wise policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," but he sang the opposite tune, saying that "a hundred flowers should bloom and coexist."

Under this reactionary logic, China's Khrushchev led Zhou Yang, Xia Yan, and others in launching a frenzied attack and frame-up against Comrade Jiang Qing, who we respect. They savagely destroyed and suppressed the new proletarian literature that had grown vigorously under the nurturing of Chairman Mao's brilliant literary thoughts. It was this China's Khrushchev who, while loudly advocating that "The Artistry of 'The Four Generals' and 'The Dragon Play' is very high," "Watching 'Swan Lake' can boost morale," and "The Mermaid is very interesting," instructed his black henchmen Peng Zhen and Zhou Yang to viciously destroy the revolutionary model operas that Comrade Jiang Qing had painstakingly cultivated, such as "Sha Jianhuai," "The Red Lantern," "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," and "The Red Detachment of Women." They slandered the revolutionary model operas as "plain water," "spoken drama with singing," and "crudely made," attempting to "ban" and "kill" a magnificent drama and cultural revolution.

China's Khrushchev is a loyal lackey of the bourgeoisie and imperialism. This old revisionist stubbornly stands on the reactionary bourgeois stance, "not banning" poisonous weeds but "banning" fragrant flowers, "not banning" the old arts of landlords and the bourgeoisie, but specially "banning" the new arts of the proletariat, using this to prepare public opinion for their restoration of capitalism in China.

The magnificent proletarian cultural revolution has made all of China's Khrushchev's "bans" and his dream of restoring capitalism come to an end. However, the class struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat in the cultural realm will long exist, and we must not relax our vigilance. We must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and launch a sustained and fierce attack on the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary black line represented by China's Khrushchev. We must thoroughly criticize all the old arts and cultures of the exploiting classes. In the midst of struggle, we will create even more brilliant new arts and cultures of the proletariat.

    中国赫鲁晓夫的“禁”和“不禁”
    北京第二通用机械厂　孟辉
    全国解放以后，中国赫鲁晓夫对于我们查禁了一批反动、黄色的书刊、戏曲，十分恼怒。他气势汹汹地叫嚷：“查禁一本书，就等于枪毙一个人。谁给你们权力查禁图书的！”并下令：“反动的书还有多少人看，要研究，不要随便禁。”“宣传封建，不怕。……和尚尼姑都不禁了，还禁戏！”
    中国赫鲁晓夫一声“开禁”，那些形形色色的帝王将相、才子佳人，以及外国的公主王子、牛鬼蛇神，都举着中国赫鲁晓夫开的“通行证”，大摇大摆地登上了我们社会主义的舞台。
    中国赫鲁晓夫还说：“京剧看不懂，可以用幻灯打字幕。唱词不要去改，那个时代的话反映那个时代的人的思想。”那些帝王将相、才子佳人说的话，放的毒，都一概不能动，不能碰，不准改。中国赫鲁晓夫声嘶力竭地叫喊：这也“不要随便禁”，那也不要随便“改”，那么，是不是他对什么都不“禁”，对什么都不“改”呢？根本不是。如果革命人民要批判旧戏剧、旧文艺，创造社会主义的新戏剧、新文艺，那他是非要大禁特禁不可的！对毛主席的英明指示，对无产阶级文艺革命的方针政策，他却要肆意歪曲，恶毒篡改！毛主席提出“百花齐放，推陈出新”的英明方针，他偏大唱反调，说要“百花齐放，允许并存”。
    就是在这种反动逻辑之下，中国赫鲁晓夫率领周扬、夏衍之流，对敬爱的江青同志进行了猖狂的攻击和陷害，对在毛主席光辉文艺思想培育下茁壮地成长起来的无产阶级新文艺，进行了疯狂的摧残和镇压。就是这个中国赫鲁晓夫，在大肆鼓吹《四郎探母》、《游龙戏凤》“艺术性很高”，“看《天鹅湖》可以提高兴致”、《鱼美人》“很有意思”的同时，指使他的黑干将彭真、周扬一伙，对江青同志辛勤培育起来的《沙家浜》、《红灯记》、《智取威虎山》、《红色娘子军》等革命样板戏进行疯狂破坏，诬蔑革命样板戏是“白开水”、是“话剧加唱”、是“粗制滥造”，妄图把一场轰轰烈烈的京剧革命和文化革命“禁”住、“禁”死。
    中国赫鲁晓夫是资产阶级、帝国主义的忠实走狗。这个老修正主义者顽固地站在反动的资产阶级立场上，“不禁”毒草
  “禁”香花，“不禁”地主、资产阶级的旧文艺，专“禁”无产阶级的新文艺，以此来为他们在中国复辟资本主义做舆论准备。
    轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命，使中国赫鲁晓夫一切
  “禁”令和复辟资本主义的黄粱美梦一齐完蛋了。但是，在文化领域中资产阶级与无产阶级的阶级斗争还会长期存在，我们决不能放松自己的警惕性。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，向以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的反革命修正主义文艺黑线发动持久而猛烈的进攻，彻底批判一切剥削阶级的旧文艺、旧文化。在斗争的烈火中，创造出更加光辉灿烂的无产阶级的新文艺、新文化。
