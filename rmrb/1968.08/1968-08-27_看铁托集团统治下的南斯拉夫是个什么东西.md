The following are some materials revealed by the Yugoslav Tito clique's newspapers. Even from these scattered and obviously heavily disguised materials, one can see that in today's Yugoslavia, capitalist elements are rampant. Newly emerged bourgeois elements and "millionaires" are once again exploiting the people, and the broad masses of laborers are still suffering from oppression and slavery. These materials make it clear what kind of place Yugoslavia is under the rule of the Tito clique.

Private Enterprises Run Rampant

In today's Yugoslavia, private enterprises are rampant. The Yugoslav newspaper *Borba* revealed that on the island of Brač, in Supetar, two new modern hotels appeared this summer. One is owned by two mechanical engineers and is classified as a "first-class hotel," with thirty rooms and a winter swimming pool. The other hotel belongs to the wealthy farmer Vladimir Vladislav and has fifty beds, costing eighty million old dinars.

According to materials revealed by Yugoslav newspapers themselves, in the Ruma region, private enterprises have opened about fifty shops in the countryside. In Belgrade, there are seventy-five private enterprises, and in Zagreb, there are seventy. In Serbia alone, there are one hundred thousand people engaged in so-called "individual labor," and there are ten thousand "illegal" craftsmen.

New Rich: "Millionaires"

Under the rule of the Tito clique, bourgeois elements are rapidly emerging, and some have already become "millionaires." The Yugoslav newspaper *Politika* reported that in Niš, some owners of private trucks have an annual net income of over twenty million old dinars. Even this newspaper of the Yugoslav revisionists admits that earning this much money "was impossible even before the war."

According to *Borba*, the average income per capita in Yugoslavia is only seventy-five thousand dinars. However, a small number of bourgeois elements "possess money that is several hundred times the average amount." This newspaper says, "Yugoslavia has quite a few millionaires, and even those with cash surpluses exceeding one billion old dinars."

Private Imports Thrive

Various bourgeois elements and private capitalists also possess foreign exchange, allowing them to freely import cars, refrigerators, and various machines from abroad. According to a report published in *Borba*, in April of this year, private capitalists with foreign exchange imported 3,350 passenger cars, 653 trucks, and nearly one hundred tractors from abroad. From January to April, private imports of washing machines totaled 11,600 units.

State-Run Enterprises Lag Behind Private Enterprises

In Yugoslavia, so-called "state-run enterprises" are essentially capitalist enterprises. However, compared to private enterprises, they are no match. *Borba* reported that at a large tender in the port of Ploče, five or six "socially-owned" enterprises competed with a private enterprise for a "large transportation business," but the business was snatched by the private enterprise "because it offered the most favorable conditions."

In Karlovac, there is a large factory employing several hundred people. However, the financial department there "doesn't even have money to cover the smallest daily needs." Fortunately for the factory, "nearby, a man named Lazara opened a private café." When the factory director, deputy director, or any employee needs to travel on business, "they often go over there to borrow money from Lazara."

In Zagreb, *Borba* says, "Social transportation enterprises are merely supplementary to private ones."

### 看铁托集团统治下的南斯拉夫是个什么东西

    看铁托集团统治下的南斯拉夫是个什么东西
    下面是南斯拉夫铁托叛徒集团报刊透露的一些材料。即使从南修报刊上的这些零星的、显然是被竭力加以掩饰过的材料，也可以看到：在今天的南斯拉夫，资本主义霉菌到处滋长，新兴的资产阶级分子和“百万富翁”重新骑在人民头上恣意盘剥，广大的劳动人民仍然遭受着压迫和奴役。这些材料使人不难看清，铁托叛徒集团统治下的南斯拉夫究竟是个什么东西。私人企业泛滥成灾
    在今天的南斯拉夫，私人企业泛滥成灾。南斯拉夫《战斗报》透露，在布拉奇岛的苏佩塔尔，今年夏天出现了两家新的现代化旅馆。一家是两个机械工程师开的，属于“高级的甲等旅馆”，有三十间房间和冬季游泳池。另一家旅馆是富农弗拉迪米尔·弗拉迪斯拉夫的财产，有五十个床位，成本八千万旧第纳尔。
    根据南斯拉夫报刊自己透露的材料，在鲁马地区，私人企业在农村开设了五十来家商店。在贝尔格莱德私人企业有七十五家，而萨格勒布有七十家。仅仅在塞尔维亚，就有十万人从事所谓“个人劳动”，“非法开业”的手工业主达到一万人。
        新暴发户：“百万富翁”
    铁托叛徒集团统治下的南斯拉夫，资产阶级分子有如病菌般迅速生长出来，有的已经成为“亿万富翁”。南斯拉夫《政治报》报道，仅在尼什有些拥有私人卡车的人，一年纯收入就超过二千万旧第纳尔。连这家南修报纸也承认，赚这么多钱“即使在战前也是不可能的”。
    据南斯拉夫《战斗报》透露，南斯拉夫按人口平均收入只有七万五千多第纳尔。但是“为数不多”的资产阶级分子
  “拥有比平均数多几百倍的钱”。这家报纸说，“南斯拉夫有不少的百万富翁，甚至有现金余额用超过一亿旧第纳尔的数字来表达的人”。
        私人进口生意兴隆
    各式各样的资产阶级分子和私人资本家，还拥有外汇，能够自由地从国外进口汽车、电冰箱和各种机器。据南修《战斗报》发表的消息，今年四月，掌握外汇的私人资本家从国外进口了三千三百五十辆旅行车，六百五十三辆卡车，将近一百辆拖拉机。今年一月到四月，私人进口的洗衣机有一万一千六百部。
        官办企业不如私人企业
    在南斯拉夫，所谓的“公营企业”实质上也是资本主义企业。但是它同私人企业比起来还是小巫见大巫，竞争不过的。南修《战斗报》报道，在普洛切港一次大型招标会上，五、六家“社会成分”的企业同一个私人企业竞争一笔“很大的运输生意”，结果生意给私人企业“抢去”，“因为它提出了最有利的条件。”
    在卡尔洛瓦茨有家大型工厂，雇佣了好几百人。但是那里的财务处“连应付最细小的日常需要的钱都没有”。不过“工厂幸运的是，在它附近有个叫拉札的人开设了一家私人咖啡馆”。当工厂总经理、副经理或某个职员要出公差时，“常常跑路到那边去，向拉札借钱。”
    在萨格勒布市，《战斗报》说，“社会运输企业只是私人的补充”。
