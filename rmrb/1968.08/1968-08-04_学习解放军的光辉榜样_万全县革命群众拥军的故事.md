The revolutionary masses of Wanquan County, Hebei Province, following the great leader Chairman Mao's great teaching of "the whole nation should learn from the People's Liberation Army," have raised high the banner of "supporting the army and loving the people." They have learned from the shining example of the People's Liberation Army, cherishing the PLA as they cherish their own eyes, and have consolidated and developed the combat friendship between the army and the people.

Learning from the PLA to Uphold the Four Firsts

Shi Jun, a student from Class 12 of Dongfanghong Middle School, has been the squad leader of the military training squad. He found it most troublesome to do ideological work. There was a classmate in the squad who had some grievances against him and would mock him whenever they met. Shi Jun always thought this classmate was backward and didn't even want to look at him. After Shi Jun exposed this thought, he received help from the military training squad leader, PLA soldier Liang Junshan. Liang Junshan said to him, "This way of thinking is wrong! Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Communist Party members should not despise or look down on backward people, but should approach them, unite with them, persuade them, and encourage them to move forward.' According to Chairman Mao's teachings, we should especially approach such classmates, often talk to them, and do patient and meticulous ideological work."

One evening, Liang Junshan called six or seven people to the classroom to discuss the squad's work. Shi Jun and the classmate who had grievances against him were both present. Liang Junshan repeatedly sought opinions from the students attending the meeting. Everyone raised many opinions about the squad's work and the cadres. Liang Junshan finally said, "It's good to raise opinions about the squad cadres. But some comrades are not like this; they have opinions about the squad cadres but don't raise them openly and instead mock and ridicule. This is wrong." The classmate interjected, saying, "I am learning from Lu Xun's style!" Liang Junshan said seriously but kindly, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'We do not generally oppose satire, but we must abolish the misuse of satire.' Lu Xun was in the dark old society with no freedom of speech, using satirical essays to fight against the enemy, which was completely correct. In our new China where the laboring people are masters, there is full democracy. Comrades have opinions about each other; following Chairman Mao's teaching of 'unity—criticism and self-criticism—unity,' we can raise them at any time. Why still mock and ridicule?"

The classmate realized his mistake and sincerely made self-criticism. Liang Junshan's patient and meticulous ideological work method greatly inspired and educated Shi Jun. The next morning, he found the classmate and made self-criticism, saying, "My past view of you was also wrong! I didn't actively approach you, help you, but instead distanced you and pushed you aside. This doesn't conform to Chairman Mao's teachings. In the future, I will definitely talk to you more, exchange opinions, and improve our unity and the squad's work." The classmate was also very moved and said, "The main mistake is mine. I will definitely change." After this, Shi Jun often sought the classmate's opinions and utilized his strengths in drawing and calligraphy, having him draw column headers and beautify the classroom, encouraging him to actively participate in the squad's work.

Not long after, Liang Junshan was transferred from the school. However, his method of upholding the Four Firsts and doing patient and meticulous ideological work remained in the school, like a seed blooming and bearing fruit in the hearts of Shi Jun and other students.

Learning from the PLA to Maintain Close Ties with the Masses

Qi Jinzong, a standing committee member of the Wanquan County Revolutionary Committee and deputy director of the Production Command Department, is a representative of the revolutionary masses. For a period, he was busy with meetings, reports, and giving instructions over the phone, showing signs of detachment from the masses. These situations were quickly noticed by the PLA soldier Hu Rongsheng, who was supporting the left.

One day, Hu Rongsheng had an intimate talk with Qi Jinzong. Hu Rongsheng said, "Comrade Qi, you are a representative of the revolutionary masses and must never detach from the masses! Chairman Mao teaches us: 'We Communists are not seeking office but are seeking revolution. We must have thorough revolutionary spirit. We must not for a moment detach from the masses.' Whether we can maintain close ties with the masses is a question of our attitude towards Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We must highly value this. Especially you, as a representative of the revolutionary masses, must pay more attention. If you detach from the masses, you will lose the role of a representative. Without the masses' supervision, you cannot represent the interests of the broad masses, and we will go astray. This is very dangerous!" Hu Rongsheng's words deeply moved Qi Jinzong. Just at this time, some comrades reflected that there were many problems in the bank that needed the Revolutionary Committee to send someone to solve. Hu Rongsheng went to the bank, visited dormitories, and listened carefully to the masses' opinions. He quickly understood the situation and suggested that the county Revolutionary Committee organize a "three-in-one combination" Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team to go to the bank and help the revolutionary masses solve the problems.

Seeing Hu Rongsheng's close ties with the masses in the bank, Qi Jinzong recalled Hu Rongsheng's words that day and received deep education. He said, "The PLA not only brought us the experience of emphasizing proletarian politics and actively applying Mao Zedong Thought, but also brought us the excellent style of maintaining close ties with the masses. The PLA is forever our shining example to learn from. I will definitely learn from the PLA and never detach from the masses for a moment."

After this, Qi Jinzong often went deep among the masses, maintaining close ties with them, discovering problems, and promptly reflecting them to the Revolutionary Committee. Once, he went to the Commercial Bureau and had a heart-to-heart talk with the masses, discovering that they did not pay attention to thrift when holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes. He immediately reflected this problem to the Revolutionary Committee, which promptly solved it. Now, the masses reflect that Qi Jinzong has made great progress in maintaining close ties with the masses and is welcomed by the masses.

Learning from the PLA to Struggle Hard

Some time ago, Wang Fuzhen, the Mao Zedong Thought study guide of the second production team of Jiuzhuang Brigade, Jiuzhuang Commune, encountered difficulties when conducting women's study classes and lost her enthusiasm for work. The PLA soldier Dong Shiliang, who was supporting agriculture in this production team, noticed this and promptly had a heart-to-heart talk with Wang Fuzhen. He and Wang Fuzhen studied together Chairman Mao's teachings: "What is work? Work is struggle. Where there are difficulties and problems, we need to go and solve them. We go to work and struggle to solve difficulties. The more difficult the place, the more we should go. This is what a good comrade should do." Dong Shiliang said to Wang Fuzhen, "Conducting women's study classes is a new thing and inevitably encounters difficulties. The question is how to face these difficulties—do we bow our heads or advance against them?" Then, Dong Shiliang introduced many heroic and model figures to her, helping her to muster courage, firm her resolve, overcome difficulties, and persist in and do well in the women's study classes.

Under Dong Shiliang's patient help, Wang Fuzhen waged a fierce struggle in her thoughts. She thought: encountering a little difficulty in conducting women's study classes and not being able to endure it is because of the "self" at work. She made a secret resolution: learn from the PLA, not be a captive of difficulties, and advance against them!

After this, Wang Fuzhen thought of the PLA's revolutionary spirit of struggling hard whenever she encountered difficulties. Because she overcame her fear of difficulties and actively relied on the masses, she conducted the women's study classes. In the study classes, the women seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, often engaged in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, and everyone cared about state affairs, basically changing the past situation of "pushing the millstone to the mill, raising chickens, feeding pigs, and taking care of children."

Learning from the PLA to Care for and Love Comrades

It was already late at night, but the single dormitory of the Machine Repair Shop was still brightly lit. Under the electric light, the apprentice Hu Gaojin was concentrating on mending his pants. He was learning to mend clothes for the first time, not knowing how to hold the needle or place the patch, and was in difficulty. Just then, the PLA soldier Xi Wanhe, who was stationed in the shop, walked in. Seeing this usually mischievous "little rascal" mending his clothes, Xi Wanhe was delighted and helped him mend the pants. Little Hu said embarrassedly, "This, this, this is not right!" Xi Wanhe said, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'We all come from the four corners of the country, for a common revolutionary goal, we have come together. ... Our cadres must care for every soldier, and everyone in the revolutionary ranks must care for, love, and help each other.' We will do as Chairman Mao says."

After this, Hu Gaojin thought: the PLA is so good! They truly deserve to be the great revolutionary army personally created by Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin, and truly deserve to be the children of the laboring people. After this, Hu Gaojin loved the PLA even more and took every move of the PLA as his learning example. Once, he saw that Wu Laoshi's shoe cover was torn. He thought: Wu Laoshi often carries molten iron, and his shoe cover tears quickly. I move the mold, and I should give the new one to him. Thinking this, he gave his new shoe cover to Wu Laoshi and used the old one himself. Wu Laoshi was very moved, but Little Hu said, "This is following Chairman Mao's teachings, learning from the PLA, and doing what should be done."

　　学习解放军的光辉榜样
　　——万全县革命群众拥军的故事
    河北省万全县广大革命群众，遵循伟大领袖毛主席“全国学人民解放军”的伟大教导，高举“拥军爱民”的旗帜，学习人民解放军的光辉榜样，象爱护自己的眼睛一样爱护中国人民解放军，巩固和发展了军民之间的战斗友谊。
    象解放军那样坚持四个第一
    东方红中学高十二班学生施俊，自从当了军训排的排长以后，最感到挠头的是做思想政治工作。排里有一个同学，对他有些意见，见了面就讽刺他，他就一直认为这个同学思想落后，连看也不想看他一眼。施俊把这种活思想暴露以后，得到了军训排长、解放军战士梁俊山同志的帮助。梁俊山对他说：“这种想法可是不对头啊！毛主席教导我们：‘共产党员对于落后的人们的态度，不是轻视他们，看不起他们，而是亲近他们，团结他们，说服他们，鼓励他们前进。’按照毛主席的教导，对这样的同学更应该接近他，经常找他谈心，要做耐心细致的思想政治工作才对呀！”
    有一天晚上，梁俊山找了六、七个人在教室里研究排里的工作，施俊以及和他闹意见的那个同学也在场。梁俊山再三向参加座谈会的同学征求意见。大家对排里的工作和干部提了不少的意见，梁俊山最后说：“对排干部有意见提出来，这就很好嘛！可是有的同学却不是这样，对排干部有意见不明提出来，爱冷嘲热讽，这种作法是不对的。”那个同学插了话，他说：“我是学习鲁迅的笔法！”梁俊山严肃而又和蔼地说：“毛主席教导我们：‘我们并不一般地反对讽刺，但是必须废除讽刺的乱用。’鲁迅处在黑暗的旧社会，没有言论自由，用冷嘲热讽的杂文形式和敌人作战，是完全正确的。在我们劳动人民当家作主的新中国，有充分的民主，同志之间互相有意见，本着毛主席‘团结——批评和自我批评——团结’的教导，完全可以随时随地提出来，为什么还要冷嘲热讽呢？”那个同学听了之后，知道自己错了，便诚恳地做了自我批评。
    梁俊山耐心细致地做思想政治工作的方法，使施俊受到了很大的启发和教育。第二天一早，他就找到那个同学作了自我批评，他说：“我过去对你的看法也是不对的！不是主动地接近你，帮助你，而是疏远你，把你甩在一边。这就不符合毛主席的教导。今后，我一定要多找你谈心，互相交换意见，搞好咱们的团结，搞好排里的工作。”那个同学也很激动地说：“主要是我的错，今后一定要改。”打这以后，施俊经常征求那个同学的意见，并且发挥他会画画、会写美术字的长处，叫他画专栏刊头，美化教室，带动他积极参加排里的工作。
    不久以后，梁俊山调离了学校。但是，他那套坚持四个第一，耐心细致地做思想政治工作的方法，却留在学校，象一颗种子在施俊和其他同学们的心田里开花结果。
    象解放军那样紧密联系群众
    万全县革命委员会常委、生产指挥部副主任齐进忠同志，是革命群众的代表。有一段时间忙于开会听汇报、打电话发指示，产生了脱离群众的苗头。这些情况，很快被支左解放军胡荣胜同志发觉了。
    一天，胡荣胜和齐进忠促膝谈心。胡荣胜说：“小齐呀，你是革命群众的代表，时刻不要脱离群众啊！毛主席教导我们：‘我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命，我们人人要有彻底的革命精神，我们不要有一时一刻脱离群众。’能否密切联系群众，这是对待毛主席革命路线的态度问题。我们应该高度重视。尤其你是革命群众的代表，更要注意。如果脱离群众，就失去群众代表的作用。没有群众的监督，不能代表广大人民群众的利益，我们就会走到邪路上去。这是很危险的啊！”胡荣胜的这一席话，给齐进忠的触动很大。正在这个时候，有的同志反映银行里存在着不少的问题，需要革委会派人去解决。胡荣胜同志就到银行去，串宿舍，下伙房，认真地倾听群众的意见，很快了解了情况，便建议县革委会组织“三结合”的毛泽东思想宣传队到银行去，帮助银行的革命群众解决了问题。
    对胡荣胜同志在银行紧密联系群众的作风，齐进忠看在眼里，又想起胡荣胜同志那天的谈话，他受到了很深的教育。他说：“解放军不仅给我们带来了突出无产阶级政治，活学活用毛泽东思想的好经验，同时也给我们带来了紧密联系群众的优良作风。解放军永远是我们学习的光辉榜样。我一定要向解放军学习，一时一刻也不脱离群众。”
    打这以后，齐进忠经常深入群众，紧密联系群众，发现问题，及时向革命委员会反映。有一次他到商业局，和群众谈心，发现这里举办毛泽东思想学习班时不注意节约。他立即把这个问题反映给革委会，及时地解决了这个问题。现在，群众反映齐进忠在联系群众方面有了很大进步，受到了群众的欢迎。
    象解放军那样艰苦奋斗
    前些日子，旧堡公社旧堡大队第二生产队学习毛主席著作辅导员王福珍，在办妇女学习班时遇到了困难，工作的劲头小了。在这个生产队支农的解放军董世亮同志发现以后，就及时地找王福珍谈心。他和王福珍共同学习了毛主席的教导：“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。那些地方有困难、有问题，需要我们去解决。我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”董世亮对王福珍说：“办妇女学习班是个新事，难免碰到困难，问题是怎样对待这些困难，在困难面前低头呢？还是迎着困难前进？”接着，董世亮给她介绍了很多英雄模范人物的事迹，帮助她鼓起勇气，坚定信心，克服困难，把妇女学习班坚持下去，并且办好。
    在董世亮的耐心帮助下，王福珍展开了激烈的思想斗争。她想：办妇女学习班遇到一点困难就吃不消了，这是“私”字在作怪。她暗下决心：向解放军学习，不当困难的俘虏，要迎着困难前进！
    以后，王福珍遇到困难，就想解放军艰苦奋斗的革命精神。由于她克服了畏难情绪，积极依靠群众，把妇女学习班办起来了。在学习班里，妇女们认真学习毛主席的最新指示，经常斗私批修，人人关心国家大事，基本上改变了过去“推碾到磨转锅头，养鸡喂猪抱娃娃”的状况。
    象解放军那样关心爱护同志
    夜已经很深了，可是机修社的单身宿舍里还灯火通明。在电灯光下，徒工胡高进正在聚精会神地缝补裤子。他是初学补衣服，针不知怎么拿，补钉不知怎么摆，正在作难的时候，驻社解放军席万和同志走进来了。他看见这个平常爱打打闹闹的“小调皮鬼”竟然自己补起衣服来，打心眼里高兴，就帮助他补起裤子来。小胡不好意思地说：“这，这，这还象话！”席万和说：“毛主席教导我们：‘我们都是来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了。……我们的干部要关心每一个战士，一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。’毛主席他老人家怎么说，我们就怎么做。”
    事后，胡高进想：解放军多好啊！他们真不愧是毛主席亲手缔造、林副主席直接指挥的伟大的革命军队，不愧是劳动人民的子弟兵。打这以后，胡高进更加热爱解放军，把解放军一举一动都作为自己学习的榜样。有一次，他看见武师傅的鞋盖破了，他想：武师傅经常端铁水，鞋盖破得快。我搬台模省鞋盖，应该把新的让给他。想到这里，他就把自己的新鞋盖给了武师傅，自己用旧的。武师傅很感动，小胡却说：“这是遵照毛主席的教导，学习人民解放军，做了一件应该做的事。”
