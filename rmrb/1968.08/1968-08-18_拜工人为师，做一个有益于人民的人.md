In the midst of the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we welcome the glorious day marking the second anniversary of Chairman Mao's first reception of us, the Red Guards. Two years ago today, I was fortunate to receive the inspection of Chairman Mao, our dearest and reddest Red Sun. This was Chairman Mao's greatest concern, trust, support, and encouragement for us Red Guards, a day of utmost happiness that I will never forget.

This February, in the midst of the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, following Chairman Mao's instruction that "all young intellectuals and students must unite with the broad masses of workers and peasants," I stepped out of the school gates and settled down at the Metallurgical Machinery Repair Factory in Xingtai, under the Metallurgical Industry Department. In the past half year, with the enthusiastic help of the worker comrades and through the practice of the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, I have begun to make some progress in transforming my bourgeois worldview and have taken my first step on the broad road of uniting with the workers.

Follow Chairman Mao Closely, Unwaveringly Unite with Workers and Peasants

Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Intellectuals, before they have become one with the people's revolutionary struggle, before they have decided to serve the people's interests and united with the people, often have subjective and individualistic tendencies. Their thoughts are often empty, and their actions often waver." In February this year, the organization decided that I should go to the Metallurgical Machinery Repair Factory in Xingtai to be an ordinary worker. At that time, due to being deeply poisoned by the revisionist educational line of the Chinese Khrushchev, when the country's needs conflicted with my so-called "voluntary" and "ideal" aspirations, bourgeois individualism reared its head. I thought: I have studied foundry for five years in the institute, although I have little practice, my theory is not shallow! I should go to a big factory in a big city to better use my knowledge and showcase my technical skills, making great contributions to the country and the people. Therefore, I was not interested in going to a small factory to be a worker.

With these conflicting thoughts, I studied Chairman Mao's brilliant works "Three Constantly Read Articles" and "The Direction of the Youth Movement." Chairman Mao teaches us: "How do we judge whether a young person is revolutionary or not? What standard do we use? There is only one standard, that is, whether they are willing and actually do unite with the broad masses of workers and peasants. Those who are willing and actually do unite with workers and peasants are revolutionary; otherwise, they are not revolutionary or are counter-revolutionary." Chairman Mao's great teachings are the key to opening my heart, the guiding light, piercing straight to the bourgeois "self" in my mind, clearly pointing out the direction forward. Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! You care most about us Red Guards, about the future and growth of revolutionary youth. At this moment, the scene of Chairman Mao receiving us comes vividly to mind: Chairman Mao on Tiananmen Gate, waving to us, smiling, so affectionate and trusting, placing boundless hope in us, guiding us forward with a mighty hand. I should follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, resolutely take the path of uniting with workers and peasants.

With the red sun in my heart, there are no obstacles on the path forward. With revolutionary enthusiasm, I packed my bags and joyfully set off to my new post. After arriving at the factory, the leaders of the revolutionary committee and the worker teachers saw that I was tired from the long journey and advised me to rest for a few days. I thought: I am here to learn from the workers. The workers deal with steel every day and are not afraid of fatigue. What is a two-day journey for me? The sooner I get to the workshop, the sooner I can learn from the teachers. The next day, I put on my new work uniform and went down to the workshop with the worker comrades.

Cast Steel First, Cast Willpower; Mold Sand First, Fight Selfishness

According to production needs, the factory assigned me to the steel casting workshop to be a sand molder. Initially, I was very enthusiastic and full of energy. After about ten days, I felt my legs aching, my back sore, and my limbs weak, developing a sense of difficulty. I thought that sand molding was too heavy and tiring, not suitable for women workers. Thus, selfish thoughts surfaced again. At that time, I thought: in the past, the country had regulations that university graduates, after working for a year of practical labor training, could leave production and become technicians. Once, I joked: "I am in the sand molding section, and after working for ten or so years, I should retire." As soon as this thought surfaced, it was caught by the workers. Old worker Liu Yuanxi saw straight into my heart and said bluntly: "Chairman Mao nurtured you for nearly twenty years of study. You work for a few years and then retire. Do you repay Chairman Mao?" The teacher's deep class feelings for Chairman Mao and his piercing criticism touched my soul deeply, making me feel hot and ashamed. From then on, the workers often enthusiastically helped me. Liu Yuanxi is an old worker who has been molding for over twenty years. He often talked to me and gave me class education. Once, he told me: In the old society, we workers and poor peasants were like cattle and horses, beaten and starved, and dreaming of going to school was unthinkable. Now, our workers and poor peasants' children can go to university, all thanks to Chairman Mao. But now, some people, after studying for a few years, have their tails in the air, not using their knowledge to serve the people and repay Chairman Mao's kindness, but seeking fame and position, using their knowledge as political capital to become technicians, engineers, and officials for personal gain. Think about it, how can this be right towards Chairman Mao? The old worker's words touched my heart and hit the mark, giving me a profound class education and education on the two-line struggle, making me hate Chinese Khrushchev and his revisionist educational line even more. With the help of the stationed PLA and worker comrades, I fiercely criticized Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist educational line and, in the workers' Mao Zedong Thought study class, fiercely fought against my selfishness.

After criticizing selfishness and revisionism, I became even closer to the worker comrades, more determined to follow Chairman Mao's words, and to be a sand molder for the people for life. My sweat mixed with the workers', and I rolled in as much oil and mud as they did. Whatever shift the workers worked, I worked the same. The workers, to take care of me, did not let me work the night shift. I thought: doing revolution cannot rely on others' care, and heavy burdens cannot be shifted to others. The more difficult the work, the more it is an opportunity to temper and test oneself. The workers were not afraid of the dark and long roads for the night shift, and neither was I. After repeatedly requesting the workers, I was finally allowed to work the night shift.

I deeply felt that: stepping from the school gate into the factory gate does not mean uniting with the workers. Only by transforming oneself and replacing the bourgeois worldview with the proletarian worldview can one truly unite with the workers.

Be a Student of Worker Teachers

Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The most intelligent and most talented are those with the most practical experience." After going down to the workshop, I never imagined that I, who thought I was a "jack of all trades" in school, had become blind and ignorant. In school, from morning to night, I had to recite "sand" several times a day. In the sand molding section, facing several kinds of "sand," I could not distinguish the types or name them. But the workers, despite not having studied much, due to their deep proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao and their unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao and the proletarian revolutionary line, on the road to advancing science and technology, they did not seek fame or gain, always thinking of Chairman Mao, and in just a few years in the factory, they had mastered the production technology skillfully and made many inventions and innovations. Things that previous generations did not dare to think of, they dared to think, dare to attempt, and dare to do; things that bourgeois technical "authorities" thought were impossible, they achieved; problems that bourgeois technical "authorities" had been struggling with for years, they solved.

Countless living facts deeply educated me, "The lowly are the wisest! The noble are the most foolish," this is an absolute truth.

"Universities must still be run, I mainly talk about universities of science and engineering that must still be run, but the school system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, and proletarian politics should be in command, following the path of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory in cultivating technical personnel from workers. Students should be selected from workers and peasants with practical experience, study in school for a few years, and then return to production practice."

In practice, I have a deeper understanding of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. I am determined to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, throw away the arrogant attitude of a university student, learn from the workers, place myself under the leadership of the working class, strive to transform my worldview, walk the path of uniting with workers, peasants, and soldiers for life, be an ordinary worker for life, and become a person beneficial to the people.

    拜工人为师，做一个有益于人民的人
    冶金工业部邢台冶金机械修造厂五好职工　杨玉芳
    在无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，迎来了伟大领袖毛主席首次接见我们红卫兵小将两周年纪念的光辉日子。
    两年前的今天，我幸福地接受了毛主席他老人家的检阅，第一次见到了我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席。这是毛主席他老人家对我们红卫兵小将的最大关怀、最大信任、最大支持、最大鼓舞，是我终生难忘的最幸福的日子。
    今年二月，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的大好形势下，遵照毛主席“全国知识青年和学生青年一定要和广大的工农群众结合在一块”的教导，我走出校门，来到冶金工业部邢台冶金机械修造厂安家落户。半年来，在工人同志的热情帮助下，在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动的实践中，使我在改造资产阶级世界观方面开始取得了一点成效，在与工人相结合的宽阔道路上，迈开了第一步。
    紧跟毛主席寸步不离
    与工农结合坚定不移
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“知识分子在其未和群众的革命斗争打成一片，在其未下决心为群众利益服务并与群众相结合的时候，往往带有主观主义和个人主义的倾向，他们的思想往往是空虚的，他们的行动往往是动摇的。”今年二月，组织上确定我去冶金工业部邢台冶金机械修造厂当一名普通工人。这时，由于自己受中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义教育路线的毒害较深，当祖国的需要和个人的所谓“志愿”、“理想”发生矛盾的时候，资产阶级个人主义思想就作怪了。我想：自己在工学院学了五年铸造专业，虽说实践不多，理论可也不浅啊！应该到大城市的大工厂才好用上自己所学的知识，施展自己的技术才能，为祖国、为人民做出大的贡献。因而，对到小厂当工人不感兴趣。
    我带着这些活思想学习了毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”和《青年运动的方向》。毛主席教导我们说：“看一个青年是不是革命的，拿什么做标准呢？拿什么去辨别他呢？只有一个标准，这就是看他愿意不愿意、并且实行不实行和广大的工农群众结合在一块。愿意并且实行和工农结合的，是革命的，否则就是不革命的，或者是反革命的。”毛主席的伟大教导，是开心的钥匙，是指路灯，一针见血地打中了我头脑里资产阶级的“私”字，给我明确地指出了前进方向。毛主席啊，毛主席！您老人家最关心我们红卫兵小将，最关心我们革命青年的前途和成长。这时，毛主席他老人家接见我们的情景又活生生地浮在眼前：毛主席在天安门城楼上向我们频频招手，微笑着，他老人家对我们无比亲切，无比信任，把无限希望寄托在我们身上，他老人家挥动巨手，给我们指明了前进方向。我应该紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚决走与工农相结合的道路。
    心中升起红太阳，前进路上无阻挡。我满怀革命激情，打起背包，愉快登程，走向新的岗位。到厂后，革命委员会的负责同志和工人师傅们见我经过长途坐车，很疲劳，劝我休息几天。我想：我是来向工人学习的，工人们天天跟钢铁打交道都不怕累，自己坐两天车算个啥？早一天下车间，早拜一天师傅。第二天，我就穿上新领来的工作服，随工人同志下了车间。
　  铸钢先铸意志　翻砂先斗私心
    根据生产的需要，厂里让我去铸钢车间做翻砂工。刚一去，自己热情很高，干劲很大。过了十几天，只觉得腿痛、腰酸，四肢无力，产生了畏难情绪。自己认为，翻砂工太重、太累，有点吃不消，不适合女工干。于是私心杂念又冒出来了。当时我想：过去国家有这样的规定，大学生参加工作后，在实践中劳动锻炼一年，就可以脱离生产，当技术员。有一次我开玩笑地说：“我在翻砂工段，干上十来年就该退休了”。这种活思想一露头，就被工人们抓住了。老工人刘元喜，一眼看到了我的心里，他直出直入地说：“毛主席培养你上了快二十年的学，你干十几年就退休，对得起毛主席他老人家吗？”老师傅对毛主席无限深厚的阶级感情和对自己一针见血的尖锐批评，深深触及了我的灵魂，只觉得脸上热辣辣的，心里十分惭愧。打这以后，工人们经常满腔热忱地帮助我。刘元喜是个干了二十多年造型的老工人，他经常和我谈心，对我进行阶级教育。有一次他对我讲：在旧社会，我们工人、贫下中农当牛做马，挨打受饿，上学那是做梦也不敢想的事。现在，我们工人、贫下中农的子女能上大学，这都是托毛主席他老人家的福。可是，现在有的人念了几年书，尾巴翘到天上去了，不是用学到的本领好好为人民服务，报答毛主席他老人家的恩情，而是闹名誉，闹地位，做为捞技术员、工程师，升官发财的政治资本，想一想这怎么对得起毛主席。老工人的话句句触动了我的心灵，字字打中了我的要害。使我受到了极为深刻的阶级教育和两条路线斗争教育，对中国赫鲁晓夫及其推行的修正主义教育路线更加仇恨。在驻厂解放军和工人同志的帮助下，我狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义教育路线，在职工毛泽东思想学习班里，狠斗了自己的私心。
  经过斗私批修，我和工人同志的心贴得更紧了，听毛主席的话，为人民做一辈子翻砂工的意志更坚定了。我的汗水和工人们流在一起，工人们身上滚多少油泥，自己身上就滚多少油泥，工人们上什么班，我也上什么班。工人们为了照顾我，不让我上夜班。我想：干革命不能让别人照顾，重担子不能让别人替自己挑，越是艰苦的工作越是锻炼和考验自己的机会。工人们上夜班不怕天黑路远，我也不怕。经过再三向工人们请求，最后也让我上夜班了。
    我深深体会到：从学校大门迈进工厂大门，并不等于就同工人相结合了，只有脱胎换骨，把资产阶级世界观换上无产阶级世界观，才能真正同工人相结合。
    当工人师傅的小学生
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”下到车间以后，万万没想到自己这个在学校自以为“百事通”的人，竟成了睁眼瞎，一窍不通。在学校从早到晚，一天要背几遍“砂子”，到了翻砂工段，面对着几种“砂子”，却辨别不出种类，叫不出名字来。可是工人们，尽管没读过几年书，由于对毛主席有最深厚的无产阶级感情，无限忠于毛主席和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，在向科学技术进军的道路上不为名、不为利，一心想着毛主席，进厂没几年时间，就熟练地掌握了生产技术，并搞了许多发明创造。前人想都不敢想的事，他们敢想、敢闯、敢干；一些资产阶级技术“权威”认为根本办不到的事，他们办到了；一些资产阶级技术“权威”多年头痛的老大难问题，他们解决了。
    无数活生生的事实，深深教育了我，“卑贱者最聪明！高贵者最愚蠢”，这是千真万确的真理。
      “大学还是要办的，我这里主要说的是理工科大学还要办，但学制要缩短，教育要革命，要无产阶级政治挂帅，走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路。要从有实践经验的工人农民中间选拔学生，到学校学几年以后，又回到生产实践中去。”
    在实践中，我对毛主席这一最新指示有了更为深刻的理解。我下决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，扔掉大学生的臭架子，拜工人为师，把自己置身于工人阶级的领导下，努力改造自己的世界观，走一辈子与工农兵相结合的道路，当一辈子普通工人，使自己成为一个“有益于人民的人”。
