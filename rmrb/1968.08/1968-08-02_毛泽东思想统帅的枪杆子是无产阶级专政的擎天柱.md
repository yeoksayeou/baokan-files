In the midst of the triumphant songs of the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, commemorating our military's glorious day, the "August 1" anniversary, holds great significance.

The People's Liberation Army of China is a revolutionary army, personally founded and led by the great commander Chairman Mao, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and dedicated to serving the people's revolutionary struggle.

The fundamental issue of revolution is the issue of power. Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power." "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." This is Chairman Mao's highest, deepest, and most profound summary of the experience of class struggle in human society, and it is the greatest and most brilliant development of the Marxist-Leninist theory of the state. Following Chairman Mao's teachings, our army has, since its inception, regarded the establishment and defense of the revolutionary government as its most sacred mission.

Historical experience tells us that gun barrels of different class natures produce governments of different class natures, and gun barrels of different class natures defend governments of different class natures. Gun barrels are always in the service of the government of their own class. Gun barrels are held by people and are commanded by people. Whoever the people holding the guns are led by, whoever commands the gun barrels, and whose line the gun barrels follow, the gun barrels belong to that class and serve that class. The construction of our army over the past few decades has focused on the construction of proletarian class nature, emphasizing political construction. This is the core of Chairman Mao's military line, the fundamental direction of our army's construction, and also our army's most fundamental glorious tradition.

Chairman Mao repeatedly teaches us: "Politics is the commander, the soul. 'Military affairs are merely one of the tools for completing political tasks.'" There is no pure military affairs divorced from politics in the world; the military affairs of each class have always been under the political leadership of their own class. Since the establishment of our army, the struggle between the two military lines has, in essence, been a political struggle, a struggle for the command of political thought, and a part of the struggle between the two lines within the Party. The proletarian military line must use Mao Zedong Thought to guide our army, use Mao Zedong Thought to command the people holding the guns, and command the gun barrels, making our army a strong pillar of proletarian dictatorship; the bourgeois military line advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionists Peng Dehuai and Luo Ronghuan attempts to use bourgeois ideology to guide our army, use bourgeois ideology to command the people holding the guns, and command the gun barrels, making our proletarian army degenerate and become a tool for the restoration of capitalism. Therefore, no matter which class, in essence, it is the politics that lead the military, and it is the politics that require the military to serve its political goals. Because politics, and only politics, most concentratedly reflect the interests and demands of the class. The bourgeoisie, because their politics are against the broad masses of the people, always try to cover up the political nature of their army, dressing up the army as if it were neutral, non-political, and super-class, in order to deceive soldiers and suppress the people. Our proletarian army openly declares its class nature, regarding the service to proletarian politics as its most glorious duty. The struggle between the two military lines in our army is a struggle between emphasizing military affairs and emphasizing politics. The bourgeois military line's emphasis on military affairs or technology is actually only a deception to oppose the emphasis on proletarian politics, in order to emphasize bourgeois politics and serve bourgeois politics. Under the wise leadership of the great commander Chairman Mao, and the resolute struggle of the broad cadres and fighters of our army armed with Mao Zedong Thought, the bourgeois military line of the Chinese Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionists Peng Dehuai and Luo Ronghuan has been thoroughly smashed, and our army has developed and grown stronger over the past few decades, always following Chairman Mao's proletarian military line of first and foremost political construction.

Our army not only emphasizes proletarian politics and the masses in its internal construction but also in all other aspects. As early as thirty-nine years ago, our great commander Chairman Mao pointed out: "The Chinese Red Army is a revolutionary armed group executing political tasks. Especially now, the Red Army is not just fighting; in addition to fighting to annihilate the enemy's military force, it also undertakes major tasks such as propagating to the masses, organizing the masses, arming the masses, helping the masses to establish revolutionary governments, and even establishing Communist Party organizations." Later, Chairman Mao pointed out: Our army is both a fighting force and a work force and a production force. On the eve of national liberation, Chairman Mao pointed out: "The People's Liberation Army will forever be a fighting force.... There must be no misunderstanding or wavering on this point. The People's Liberation Army is also a work force.... As the fighting gradually decreases, the role of the work force increases." On May 7, 1966, Chairman Mao issued the great call: "The People's Liberation Army should be a great school." In January 1967, Chairman Mao again issued the great directive: "The People's Liberation Army should support the broad leftist masses." Under the radiant thought of the great leader Chairman Mao, our army has walked a path completely different from that of the bourgeois army and the revisionist army over the past few decades, showing the multifaceted functions of the people's army. For example, our army not only plays a role in the military field but also in the political, ideological, and production fields; it is not only a strong force to defend against external enemy invasions but also a strong force to prevent internal enemies from usurping and subverting our proletarian government; it not only relies on guns and cannons but also emphasizes the political factors of our army, the role of people, and the great power of Mao Zedong Thought, etc. Thus, our army is not only an armed force but also a political force, ideological force, productive force, and educational force armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao has fully played the role of our army in establishing, consolidating, and defending the proletarian government, further opening up a broader horizon for the proletariat to use its own army. This is the brilliant achievement of Chairman Mao's military thought and military line, and a great development of Marxist-Leninist military theory and proletarian dictatorship theory.

Through this great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the construction of our army has entered a new stage, making our army more political and more proletarian, and the emphasis on proletarian politics and political construction has reached a new height. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a profound political and revolutionary training for our army, a grand movement of loving the government and the people, and a university of Mao Zedong Thought without textbooks. The broad cadres and fighters of our army have an even greater love, admiration, faith, and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines has reached an unprecedented height. The blood ties between our army and the broad masses of the people have developed to an unprecedented breadth and depth, and the people play an even more important role in the political life of the People's Liberation Army. The spiritual face of our army has been renewed, and the combat effectiveness of the troops is stronger than ever before.

The revolutionary committees born in the great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution are "a creation of the working class and the people in this cultural revolution," the newest form of proletarian government, and the power organs under the command of Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters. We must further strengthen the consciousness of serving the proletarian government, always remember proletarian dictatorship. We must resolutely support, respect, and defend the revolutionary committees and maintain the proletarian authority of the revolutionary committees. In the face of the great achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the class enemies, in order to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and proletarian dictatorship, use various means to direct their attacks at the revolutionary committees. We must resolutely smash their counter-revolutionary conspiracies to sabotage the revolutionary committees, exercise our sacred duty as the proletarian army to defend the proletarian government, and firmly support the revolutionary committees at all levels, the broad revolutionary masses, and the Red Guards. Loving the government and the people means supporting the revolutionary committees at all levels and loving the broad revolutionary masses and the Red Guards.

Chairman Mao is the most outstanding leader of the proletariat in contemporary times, the greatest Marxist-Leninist in contemporary times, and the supreme commander of our army. The experience of our army over forty-one years can be summed up in one point: Mao Zedong Thought is the source of strength for the growth and development of our army, and it is the lifeline of our army. Political construction of the army means constructing the army with Mao Zedong Thought; emphasizing politics means emphasizing Mao Zedong Thought. In the construction of the army, the position of Mao Zedong Thought and the attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental difference and the focus of the struggle between the two lines in the past and in the future. We must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line of first and foremost political construction of the army, continue to deeply criticize the bourgeois military line advocated by the handful of top capitalist roaders within the Party led by the Chinese Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionists Peng Dehuai and Luo Ronghuan, further arm the broad cadres and fighters with the great Mao Zedong Thought, and make sure that the gun barrels are always firmly in the hands of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. This is a big matter concerning whether our proletarian army will never change color, and it is also a big matter concerning whether our proletarian government will never change color.

The revolutionary army personally founded and led by Chairman Mao, and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin, tempered and grown in decades of revolutionary war and the struggle between the two lines, will forever be loyal to the great commander Chairman Mao, forever loyal to the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, forever loyal to the Central Cultural Revolution Group that holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely support and defend the revolutionary committees, and forever be the pillar of proletarian dictatorship. With the wise leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, the broad masses of workers and peasants armed with Mao Zedong Thought, the gun barrels guided by Mao Zedong Thought, and the pens guided by Mao Zedong Thought, our seven hundred million people will definitely be able to make our government forever firmly in the hands of the proletariat, and make our socialist motherland the greatest and strongest country in the world.

　　毛泽东思想统帅的枪杆子是无产阶级专政的擎天柱
　　中国人民解放军空军司令部　红尖兵
    在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，纪念我军光荣的节日——“八一”建军节，有着非常重要的意义。
    中国人民解放军，是伟大统帅毛主席亲自缔造和领导的，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的，全心全意为人民革命斗争服务的革命军队。
    革命的根本问题是政权问题。毛主席教导我们说：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”“枪杆子里面出政权”。这是毛主席对人类社会阶级斗争经验最高度最深刻最精辟的概括，是对马克思列宁主义国家学说最伟大最天才的发展。遵照毛主席的教导，我军从诞生的那一天起，就把建立和保卫革命政权作为自己最崇高的使命。
    历史经验告诉我们，不同阶级性的枪杆子出不同阶级性的政权，不同阶级性的枪杆子保卫不同阶级性的政权。枪杆子总是为本阶级的政权服务的。枪杆子是由人掌握的，是受人指挥的。拿枪的人受哪个阶级的领导，受哪个阶级的司令部指挥，执行哪个阶级的路线，枪杆子就属于哪个阶级，就为哪个阶级服务。我军几十年来的建设，就是着重无产阶级阶级性的建设，着重政治建设。这是毛主席建军路线的核心，是我军建设的根本方向，也是我军最根本的光荣传统。
    毛主席反复教导我们：政治是统帅，是灵魂。“军事只是完成政治任务的工具之一。”世界上没有脱离政治的单纯军事，各阶级的军事，从来都是受本阶级的政治领导的。我军建立以来两条军事路线的斗争，从根本性质来说，仍然是政治的斗争，是争夺政治思想指挥权的斗争，是党内两条路线斗争的组成部分。无产阶级军事路线要用毛泽东思想统帅我们的军队，用毛泽东思想指挥拿枪的人，指挥枪杆子，使我军成为无产阶级专政的强大支柱；中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿所推行的资产阶级军事路线，则妄图用资产阶级思想统帅我们的军队，用资产阶级思想指挥拿枪的人，指挥枪杆子，使我们无产阶级的军队变质，成为复辟资本主义的工具。所以说，无论哪个阶级，从本质来说，都是靠政治领导军事，都是要求军事为它的政治服务的。因为政治，也只有政治，才最集中地反映了阶级的利益和要求。资产阶级由于其政治是反广大人民群众的，所以，它们总是千方百计地掩盖其军队的政治性，把军队打扮成似乎是中立的、不过问政治的、超阶级的力量，用以欺骗士兵，镇压人民。我们无产阶级的军队公开申明自己的阶级性，以为无产阶级政治服务作为自己最光荣的职责。我军两条军事路线的斗争，一条是突出军事，一条是突出政治。资产阶级军事路线的突出军事或突出技术，实际上，只不过是为了反对突出无产阶级政治，以便突出资产阶级政治和为资产阶级政治服务所玩弄的欺骗伎俩而已。在伟大统帅毛主席的英明领导下，在毛泽东思想武装起来的我军广大指战员的坚决斗争下，中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿的资产阶级军事路线被彻底粉碎，我军几十年来一直沿着毛主席首先和着重政治建军的无产阶级军事路线发展壮大。
    我军不仅在内部建设方面，而且在其他各个方面都坚持突出无产阶级政治，突出群众。早在三十九年以前，我们的伟大统帅毛主席就英明地指出：“中国的红军是一个执行革命的政治任务的武装集团。特别是现在，红军决不是单纯地打仗的，它除了打仗消灭敌人军事力量之外，还要负担宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众、帮助群众建立革命政权以至于建立共产党的组织等项重大的任务。”后来，毛主席指出：我军既是一个战斗队，又是一个工作队、生产队。在全国解放前夕，毛主席指出：“人民解放军永远是一个战斗队。……对于这一点不能有任何的误解和动摇。人民解放军又是一个工作队，……随着战斗的逐步地减少，工作队的作用就增加了。”一九六六年五月七日，毛主席发出“人民解放军应该是一个大学校”的伟大号召。一九六七年一月，毛主席又发出“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大指示。在伟大领袖毛主席的光辉思想的照耀下，我军几十年来走着既与资产阶级军队又与修正主义军队完全不同的道路，表现了人民军队的多方面的职能。例如，我军不仅在军事领域里，而且在政治、思想和生产领域里发挥作用；不仅是防御外部敌人侵略的强大力量，而且是防止内部敌人篡夺和颠覆我们无产阶级政权的强大力量；不仅是靠枪靠炮，而且着重发挥我军的政治因素，发挥人的作用，发挥毛泽东思想的强大威力，等等。从而使我军不仅是一支武装力量，而且是一支用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的政治力量、思想力量、生产力量和教育力量。毛主席亲自发动亲自领导的无产阶级文化大革命，使我军在建立、巩固和保卫无产阶级政权等方面的作用，得到了充分的发挥，进一步开辟了无产阶级使用自己军队的更广阔的天地。这是毛主席军事思想和军事路线的光辉成就，是对马克思列宁主义军事学说和无产阶级专政理论的伟大发展。
    通过这场伟大的无产阶级文化大革命运动，我军建设提高到了崭新的阶段，使我军锻炼得更政治化，更无产阶级化，突出无产阶级政治和政治建军达到了新的高度。无产阶级文化大革命对我军是深刻的政治大练兵、革命大练兵，是波澜壮阔的拥政爱民的大运动，是没有编成课本的毛泽东思想大学习。我军广大指战员对伟大领袖毛主席、毛泽东思想和毛主席的革命路线更加无限热爱、无限崇拜、无限信仰、无限忠诚，阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟空前大提高。我军同广大人民群众的血肉联系，发展到了前所未有的广度和深度，在人民解放军的政治生活里，人民群众发挥着更加重要的影响。我军的精神面貌焕然一新，部队战斗力比以往任何时候都更加强大。
    在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中诞生的革命委员会，“是工人阶级和人民群众在这次文化大革命中的一种创造”，是无产阶级政权的最新形式，是毛主席无产阶级司令部统帅下的各级权力机构。我们要进一步加强为无产阶级政权服务的观念，要念念不忘无产阶级专政。要坚决拥护、支持、尊重和保卫革命委员会，维护革命委员会的无产阶级权威。在无产阶级文化大革命取得丰硕成果的大好形势下，阶级敌人为了破坏无产阶级文化大革命和无产阶级专政，采用各种手段把矛头指向革命委员会。我们要迎头痛击他们破坏革命委员会的反革命阴谋，行使我们无产阶级军队保卫无产阶级政权的神圣职责，坚决作各级革命委员会、广大革命群众和红卫兵小将的坚强后盾。拥政爱民，就是要拥护各级革命委员会，爱护广大革命群众和红卫兵小将。
    毛主席是当代无产阶级最杰出的领袖，是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，是我军的最高统帅。我军四十一年的经验集中到一点，那就是：毛泽东思想是我军成长壮大的力量源泉，是我军的命根子。政治建军，就是用毛泽东思想建军；突出政治，就是突出毛泽东思想。在军队建设中，把毛泽东思想放在什么地位，对毛泽东思想抱什么态度，这是过去也将是今后两条路线的根本分歧和斗争焦点。我们要坚决贯彻执行毛主席的首先和着重政治建军的无产阶级革命路线，持续深入地开展对以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮最大走资派和反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿所推行的资产阶级军事路线的革命大批判，进一步用伟大的毛泽东思想武装广大指战员的头脑，使枪杆子永远牢固地掌握在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部手里。这是关系到我们无产阶级军队永不变色的大事情，也是关系到我们无产阶级政权永不变色的大事情。
    毛主席亲自缔造、亲自领导，林彪副主席直接指挥的在几十年革命战争和两条路线斗争中锻炼成长的革命军队，永远忠于伟大统帅毛主席，永远忠于以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，永远忠于高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的中央文革，坚决拥护和保卫革命委员会，永远做无产阶级专政的擎天柱。我国七亿人民有伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导，有毛泽东思想武装起来的广大工农群众，有毛泽东思想统帅的枪杆子和毛泽东思想统帅的笔杆子，就一定能够使我们的政权永远牢固地掌握在无产阶级手中，使我们的社会主义祖国成为世界上最伟大和最强大的国家。
