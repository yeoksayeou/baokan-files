    No matter when and in what circumstances, as long as we resolutely follow the command of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and strictly carry out Chairman Mao's instructions, we will definitely move from victory to victory. In the future class struggles, we are determined to even more firmly adhere to the principle of—

    All actions under the command of Supreme Commander Chairman Mao
    "Model Platoon for Supporting the Left and Loving the People"

    The decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution made by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China under the personal guidance of our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao is the great program for continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. Over the past two years, under the guidance of this brilliant document, the hundreds of millions of revolutionary people across the country, following the great strategic deployment of the great leader Chairman Mao, have smashed with thunderous force the bourgeois headquarters headed by the Chinese Khrushchev that had long been hidden within our party, exposed the Chinese Khrushchev and other clique of capitalist roaders within the party who represent the interests of the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and seized back the power over party, government, finance, and culture that they had usurped, achieving decisive victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    In these two years, we have repeatedly studied the "Sixteen Points" with questions in mind, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's theories, lines, policies, and principles on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and seriously grasped the essence of the struggle between the two lines. The proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin most concentratedly represents the fundamental interests of the broad revolutionary masses. In any situation, it insists on the dictatorship of the proletariat and firmly leads the masses to follow the socialist path, guiding the broad revolutionary masses to fight to the end against all class enemies at home and abroad and against the schemes of class enemies to restore capitalism. The bourgeois headquarters headed by the Chinese Khrushchev represents the Kuomintang reactionaries, that is, the interests of the bourgeoisie and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. It constantly plots to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat and suppress the broad revolutionary masses, attempting to make the broad revolutionary masses return to the old road of oppression and exploitation. We have boundless love for the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and unlimited loyalty to the great commander Chairman Mao. All actions under the command of Supreme Commander Chairman Mao is our highest and most noble quality and the highest level of consciousness.

    Chairman Mao loves me, I love Chairman Mao; Chairman Mao supports me, I support Chairman Mao; Chairman Mao instructs me, I carry it out; Chairman Mao waves his hand, I advance. Regarding Chairman Mao's instructions and every battle order from the proletarian headquarters, we support them a thousand times and carry them out ten thousand times. We execute them resolutely if we understand them, and we execute them resolutely even if we do not understand them at the moment, deepening our understanding in the process of execution. On the front lines of the "Three Supports, Two Militaries," we follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, believe in the masses, rely on the masses, fully mobilize the masses, and firmly grasp class struggle. We carry out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism and have achieved one victory after another.

    The "Sixteen Points" stipulate: "Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." To implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and carry out the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters, we must act swiftly and decisively. This is a major issue of loyalty to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Whenever Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the voice of the proletarian headquarters are heard, we immediately study them and immediately carry them out. Even if it is midnight, as long as we hear Chairman Mao's latest instructions, we immediately get up, study them seriously, and organize propaganda overnight to ensure that Chairman Mao's latest instructions are disseminated without delay. We have realized that no matter what circumstances we encounter, no matter how many twists and turns, difficulties, and obstacles we face, as long as we resolutely follow the command of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin and strictly carry out Chairman Mao's instructions, we will definitely achieve the final victory. The victories of our era, whether a thousand victories or ten thousand victories, are all great victories of Mao Zedong Thought!

    As the revolutionary struggle deepens, the class enemies are constantly changing their tactics. In the new situation, only by following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment can we maintain a clear mind, not relax our fighting will, and not lose our political direction. When the work of cleansing the class ranks is vigorously carried out, a small handful of class enemies, facing imminent doom, spread rumors and shoot dark arrows, attempting to overthrow the newly born revolutionary committees. At this moment, we received Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is essentially a political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and the Kuomintang reactionaries under its leadership, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Through serious study, we further clarified the essence of the class struggle in the Cultural Revolution, widely mobilized the masses, exposed the evil schemes of this small handful of class enemies, repelled their ferocious attacks, and defended the newly born revolutionary committees.

    The proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin is the sole leadership center for the entire party, the entire army, and the people of the entire country. We are determined to closely unite around Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters, unify our will, unify our steps, and unify our actions. We will thoroughly criticize the reactionary "multi-center theory," follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and advance courageously along Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line! We will achieve new victories for the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

### 一切行动听最高统帅毛主席指挥

    不管在任何时候和任何情况下，只要我们坚决听从以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的指挥，不折不扣地执行毛主席的指示，就一定会从胜利走向胜利。在今后的阶级斗争风浪中，我们决心更加坚定地做到——
　　一切行动听最高统帅毛主席指挥
　　“支左爱民模范排”
    我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的《中国共产党中央委员会关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》，是无产阶级专政条件下继续进行革命的伟大纲领。两年来，在这个光辉文件的指引下，全国亿万革命人民，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的伟大战略部署，以雷霆万钧之势，彻底粉碎了长期隐藏在我们党内的以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，揪出了代表美帝、苏修和国民党反动派利益的中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派，夺回了被他们窃取的那部分党、政、财、文大权，取得了无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利。
    在这两年中，我们带着问题反复学习“十六条”，反复学习毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，认真领会两条路线斗争的实质。以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，最集中地代表了广大革命群众的根本利益。它在任何情况下，都坚持无产阶级专政，坚定地引导群众走社会主义道路，带领广大革命人民群众，同国内外一切阶级敌人斗争到底，同阶级敌人复辟资本主义的阴谋斗争到底。以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，代表国民党反动派，即资产阶级和地、富、反、坏、右分子的利益。它时刻阴谋颠覆无产阶级专政，镇压广大革命人民群众，妄图使广大革命人民群众回到受压迫受剥削的老路上去。我们对以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部无比热爱，对伟大统帅毛主席无限忠诚，一切行动听最高统帅毛主席的指挥。这是我们革命战士最高贵的品质，最高的觉悟。
    毛主席热爱我热爱，毛主席支持我支持，毛主席指示我照办，毛主席挥手我前进。对于毛主席的指示，对于无产阶级司令部的每一个战斗号令，我们都一千个拥护，一万个照办。理解的坚决执行，暂时不理解的也坚决执行，在执行中加深理解。在“三支”、“两军”第一线，我们紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下，相信群众，依靠群众，充分发动群众，狠抓阶级斗争，深入持久地开展革命的大批判，取得了一个又一个的胜利。
    “十六条”规定：“毛泽东思想是无产阶级文化大革命的行动指南”。落实毛主席的最新指示，执行毛主席的无产阶级司令部的战斗号令，必须闻风而动，雷厉风行，这是对毛主席、对毛泽东思想、对毛主席的革命路线忠不忠的大问题。每当毛主席的最新指示和无产阶级司令部的声音一传来，我们就立即学习，立即贯彻执行。那怕是深夜，只要听到毛主席的最新指示，我们就马上起床，认真地学习，连夜组织宣传，做到传播毛主席的最新指示不过夜。我们体会到，不管在任何情况下，遇到什么曲折，碰到多大的困难和障碍，只要我们坚决听从以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的指挥，不折不扣地执行毛主席的指示，就一定会取得最后胜利。我们的时代，千胜利，万胜利，都是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！
    随着革命斗争形势的深入发展，阶级敌人在不断变换着他们的斗争策略。在新形势下，只有紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，才能保持清醒的头脑，不松懈战斗意志，不迷失政治方向。当清理阶级队伍的工作轰轰烈烈地开展起来的时候，一小撮阶级敌人面临灭顶之灾，他们就造谣言，放暗箭，妄图颠覆新生的革命委员会。就在这时候，传来了毛主席的最新指示：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”通过认真学习，我们进一步认清了文化大革命的阶级斗争的实质，便广泛发动群众，揭露这一小撮阶级敌人的罪恶阴谋，回击了他们的猖狂进攻，保卫了新生的革命委员会。
    以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，是全党、全军、全国人民唯一的领导中心。我们决心紧紧地团结在毛主席的无产阶级司令部的周围，统一意志，统一步伐，统一行动，彻底批判反动的“多中心论”，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线奋勇前进！为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利立新功！
