The Deputy Military Attaché of the Chinese Embassy in Vietnam, Yuan Yunlou, held a reception on July 31 to celebrate the 41st anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

	Invited to attend the reception were: General Vo Nguyen Giap, member of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party, Vice Premier and Minister of Defense, Deputy Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach, Vice Chairman of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association Son Quang Phuc, Deputy Minister of Defense Tran Do, Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the People's Army Phan Tam, leaders of various military branches, and representatives from central and Hanoi organizations.

	The representative of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in North Vietnam, Nguyen Van Tien, was also invited to attend the reception.

	Diplomatic envoys and military attachés from various countries in Vietnam also attended the reception.

	Yuan Yunlou spoke first at the reception. He said, "The Chinese People's Liberation Army is a new-type people's army personally founded and nurtured by our great leader Chairman Mao, and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin Biao. In the past, it defeated all enemies, both domestic and foreign, and wrote magnificent chapters for the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people and the people of the world. Today, it is again making new contributions to the people by defending our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, defending the dictatorship of the proletariat, and defending the cause of socialist construction."

	Yuan Yunlou said, "The sea voyage relies on the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. Over the past 41 years, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has been able to advance from victory to victory because of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. The Chinese People's Liberation Army is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line."

	Yuan Yunlou said, "Comrade Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Comrade Mao Zedong is a great statesman and military strategist who is skilled at directing wars according to the laws of war. Comrade Mao Zedong's theory on seizing political power through armed struggle, his theory of people's war, and his other series of brilliant military thoughts are the most precious treasures in the treasury of Marxist-Leninist military theory. Our deputy commander, Comrade Lin Biao, has been a close comrade-in-arms of Chairman Mao for decades, consistently and most loyally, firmly, and thoroughly executing and defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line."

	Yuan Yunlou said, "The Chinese People's Liberation Army feels infinitely fortunate and proud to have such great commanders and deputy commanders leading and commanding it."

	Yuan Yunlou talked about the great situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. He said, "Through the tempering of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, this great wall of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has become even more solid."

	Yuan Yunlou warmly praised the heroic Vietnamese people, under the wise leadership of Great Leader Ho Chi Minh, for displaying the spirit of "fighting to the end" and uniting north and south, with a common hatred for the enemy, achieving great victories in the war of resistance against American aggression.

	Yuan Yunlou pointed out that the aggressive ambitions of American imperialism will not change. It will not lay down its butcher's knife and become a Buddhist monk overnight. Recently, after suffering a humiliating defeat in the Vietnam battlefield, American imperialism has resorted to two counter-revolutionary tactics: on the one hand, intensifying the war of aggression in Vietnam, and on the other hand, in close collaboration with modern revisionism, stepping up the "peace talks" charade, attempting to grab from the negotiating table what it cannot grab from the battlefield. This is unacceptable to the Vietnamese people. All Vietnamese people are responding to the call of Great Leader Ho Chi Minh, uniting more closely, persisting in a protracted war, and fighting for the great goal of completely defeating the American aggressors and liberating the entire Vietnam. We are confident that the heroic Vietnamese people, by persisting in a protracted war, will surely win the final victory in the war of resistance against American aggression.

	Yuan Yunlou expressed that the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will definitely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, hold high the banner of proletarian internationalism, and firmly and unshakably support the Vietnamese brothers in their war of resistance against American aggression until final victory.

	General Vo Nguyen Giap then spoke. He said, "Over the past 41 years, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, has written an extremely brilliant history under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party headed by beloved Chairman Mao. With the wholehearted support of the people, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has continuously displayed revolutionary spirit, defeated the reactionary Kuomintang clique supported by American imperialism, and made a decisive contribution to leading the Chinese revolution to brilliant victory and establishing the great People's Republic of China. Since then, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has been constantly on high alert, effectively defending the fruits of the Chinese people's revolution, and actively participating in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

	Vo Nguyen Giap said, "The Vietnamese people and the armed forces of all ethnic groups feel extremely proud to have the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army as a glorious comrade-in-arms, and sincerely wish the Chinese People's Liberation Army more great victories in its sublime revolutionary cause."

	Vo Nguyen Giap said, "Vietnam and China are two brotherly countries united by an increasingly solid fighting friendship. In our past war against the French and the current war against the Americans, as well as in the cause of socialist construction, the Vietnamese people and the armed forces of all ethnic groups have consistently received immense, precious, and brotherly support and help from the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army. I once again express the heartfelt thanks of the Vietnamese people and the armed forces of all ethnic groups to beloved Chairman Mao, the brotherly Chinese Communist Party, government, people, and the People's Liberation Army."

	Vo Nguyen Giap emphasized that the struggle of the Vietnamese people for independence and freedom against the American imperialist aggressors is entering an extremely fierce yet glorious period of victory. The brilliant and consecutive victories achieved by the people of South and North Vietnam are pushing American imperialism into a desperate situation. Vo Nguyen Giap condemned that American imperialism is continuing and intensifying its aggression in both South and North Vietnam. He said, American imperialism is sending more American troops and mercenaries to South Vietnam, using all means to stabilize the collapsing puppet army and puppet regime, savagely attacking and bombing villages and cities; and strengthening attacks on North Vietnam.

	Vo Nguyen Giap said, "The Vietnamese people, from south to north, are responding to Chairman Ho's sacred call to resist American aggression, strengthening their determination to defeat the American aggressors, resolutely advancing to victory, fighting fiercely, continuously, and fighting until the final victory."

	The reception was held in a warm and friendly atmosphere.

　　中国人民坚定不移支援越南兄弟打到底
　　武元甲赞扬中国人民解放军在毛主席领导下写下灿烂的历史
    新华社河内一日电　中国驻越南民主共和国大使馆代理武官袁云楼七月三十一日举行招待会，热烈庆祝中国人民解放军建军四十一周年。
    应邀出席招待会的有：越南劳动党中央政治局委员、副总理兼国防部长武元甲大将，外交部副部长阮基石，越中友好协会副会长孙光阀，国防部副部长陈参，人民军总政治局副主任范玉茂，各军种兵种负责人以及中央和河内各机关团体的代表。
    越南南方民族解放阵线常驻越南北方代表团团长阮文进也应邀出席了招待会。
    出席招待会的还有各国驻越南的外交使节和武官。
    袁云楼在招待会上首先发表讲话。他说，中国人民解放军是由我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自缔造和培育，林彪副主席直接指挥的一支新型的人民军队。在过去，它战胜了国内外一切敌人，为中国人民和世界人民的革命事业写下了壮丽的诗篇。今天，它在保卫我国无产阶级文化大革命、保卫无产阶级专政、保卫社会主义建设事业方面又为人民建立了新的功勋。
    袁云楼说，大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。四十一年来，中国人民解放军之所以能从胜利走向胜利，就是靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想。中国人民解放军无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    袁云楼说，毛泽东同志是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。毛泽东同志是善于按照战争规律指导战争的伟大的政治家和军事家。毛泽东同志关于武装夺取政权的学说，关于人民战争的理论，和其它一系列光辉的军事思想，是马克思列宁主义军事学说宝库中的最珍贵的财富。我们的副统帅林彪同志是毛主席的亲密战友。林彪同志几十年如一日，一贯最忠实、最坚定、最彻底地执行和捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    袁云楼说，中国人民解放军为有这样伟大的统帅和副统帅领导和指挥，感到无比幸福和自豪。
    袁云楼谈到了中国无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势。他说：经过无产阶级文化大革命运动的锻炼，中国人民解放军这个伟大长城更加坚固了。
    袁云楼热烈赞扬英雄的越南人民在伟大领袖胡志明主席的英明领导下，发扬“决战决胜”精神，南北一心，同仇敌忾，在抗美救国战争中，取得了伟大胜利。
    袁云楼指出，美帝国主义的侵略野心是不会改变的。它决不会放下屠刀，立地成佛。最近，美帝国主义在越南战场惨遭失败后，又施展反革命的两手，一面强化侵越战争，一面在现代修正主义的密切配合下，加紧进行“和平谈判”的骗局，妄图从谈判桌上捞取它在战场上捞不到的东西。这是越南人民所不答应的。全体越南人民正在响应伟大领袖胡主席的号召，更加紧密地团结起来，坚持持久战，为彻底打败美国侵略者，解放整个越南的伟大目标而战斗。我们坚信，英雄的越南人民坚持持久战，一定能赢得抗美救国战争的最后胜利。
    袁云楼表示，经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的中国人民和中国人民解放军一定坚决遵循毛主席的教导，更高地举起无产阶级国际主义旗帜，坚定不移地全力支援越南兄弟的抗美救国战争，直到取得最后胜利。
    接着，武元甲发表讲话。他说，四十一年来，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民解放军，在以敬爱的毛主席为首的光荣的中国共产党的领导下写下了无比灿烂的历史。在人民的全心全意的支持下，中国人民解放军不断发扬革命精神，打垮了得到美帝国主义支持的蒋介石反动集团，为把中国革命引向辉煌胜利和建立伟大的中华人民共和国作出了决定性的贡献。中国人民解放军从那时起就不断提高警惕性，有效地保卫了中国人民的革命成果，积极地参加了无产阶级文化大革命。
    武元甲说：越南人民和各族人民武装力量为有英雄的中国人民解放军这一光荣的战友而感到无比自豪，并且真诚地祝愿中国人民解放军在自己崇高的革命事业中取得更多的巨大胜利。
    武元甲说：越南和中国是日益牢固的战斗友谊凝结起来的两个兄弟国家。我们越南人民和各族人民武装力量在自己过去的抗法战争中和目前的抗美战争中以及在社会主义建设事业中，一贯得到中国人民和中国人民解放军给予的无比巨大、宝贵、充满兄弟和同志情谊的支持和帮助。我再一次表示越南人民和各族人民武装力量对敬爱的毛主席、兄弟的中国共产党、政府、人民和人民解放军的衷心感谢。
    武元甲强调说，越南人民为争取独立、自由而进行的反对美帝国主义侵略者的战斗正在进入一个无比激烈而又充满辉煌胜利的时期。越南南方和北方人民所取得的辉煌和接连的胜利，正在使美帝国主义陷入走投无路的处境。武元甲谴责美帝国主义正在越南南北两地继续和加强侵略战争。他说，美帝国主义正向越南南方增派美军和帮凶军，使用一切办法来稳定面临崩溃的伪军和伪政权，无比野蛮地袭击和轰炸乡村和城市；并且加强袭击越南北方。
    武元甲说：越南人民，从南至北，响应胡主席神圣的抗美救国号召，加强战胜美国强盗侵略的决心，坚决乘胜前进，狠狠地打、连续地打、一直战斗到最后胜利。
    招待会是在热烈友好的气氛中进行的。
