The "Voice of the Thai People" radio station broadcasted an article on the 7th, enthusiastically hailing the victories achieved by the Thai Communist Party in leading the Thai people in revolutionary armed struggle over the past three years. The article calls on the Thai people to establish rural base areas under the leadership of the Thai Communist Party, persist in people's war, surround the cities from the countryside, and ultimately seize national power.

The article states that the victories in the Thai people's armed struggle have made the revolutionary situation in Thailand unprecedentedly good. It has heavily struck the U.S. imperialists and the traitorous government of Thanon-Babbo, fundamentally shaking their reactionary rule and making their positions even more unstable.

The article states that the victories in the people's armed struggle have had an increasingly profound impact on the masses. As the Thai Communist Party has pointed out, the initial victories in the people's armed struggle not only prove that the U.S. imperialists and the Thanon-Babbo clique are paper tigers, and that the people can definitely defeat them, but also have great significance. It declares that the Thai people's revolutionary struggle has entered a new stage, setting an example for the entire nation and inspiring and promoting the rapid development of the Thai people's revolutionary struggle.

The article points out that the sparks of the Thai people's armed struggle can continue to exist and spread rapidly to thirty provinces in the face of the enemy's frenzied "encirclement and suppression." This is because the Thai people's armed struggle is a people's war led by the Thai Communist Party, which has resolutely implemented the political and military lines of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and applied the strategic and tactical principles of the great leader of the world revolutionary people, Chairman Mao Zedong, on people's war. Because the people's armed forces are truly the people's army, serving the people wholeheartedly, fighting for the cause of national and people's liberation, they have gained the sincere support of the people.

The article states that the rapid development of the Thai revolutionary situation proves that the line, policies, and principles of the Thai Communist Party are extremely correct. They adhere to the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times—Mao Zedong Thought—as a guide, combining it with Thai revolutionary practice, and are in line with the actual situation of the Thai revolution and the demands of the broad masses of the people.

The article states that the Thai Communist Party has pointed out to the Thai people that U.S. imperialism and the traitorous Thanon-Babbo clique are the enemies of the Thai nation and people. To eliminate these two enemies, to strive for independence, democracy, and a peaceful life, the people must unite, form a broad patriotic democratic united front, and fight against the enemy in various ways, supporting and cooperating with each other, especially conducting armed struggle, mobilizing the peasant masses, establishing rural base areas, persisting in people's war, surrounding the cities from the countryside, and ultimately seizing national power. This is in accordance with Chairman Mao Zedong's teachings: "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." "The central task and highest form of revolution is to seize political power through armed struggle, to solve problems through war. This Marxist-Leninist revolutionary principle is universally applicable, whether in China or abroad, it is correct." "Without an army of the people, there is nothing of the people."

The article points out that the brilliant victories achieved in the Thai people's armed struggle over the past three years have made all patriotic democratic people and all oppressed and exploited people feel joyful and proud. However, this victory is only the first step on the long revolutionary journey. On the revolutionary journey, there are still many difficulties and obstacles that we need to overcome. As the Thai Communist Party has pointed out, the struggle that the Thai people are currently waging is a just struggle, has a future, and will definitely achieve the final victory. However, since the enemy's strength is temporarily superior, we will have to go through a period of arduous, tortuous, and long-term struggle.

The article states that although there are still many difficulties on the road of armed struggle, because there is the leadership of the Thai Communist Party, the invincible weapon of Mao Zedong Thought as a guide for struggle, the support of the broad masses of the people, and the people's armed forces and the people's firm and brave fighting spirit, any great difficulty can be overcome.

The article points out that the current international situation is excellent. Mao Zedong Thought, this powerful ideological weapon against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries, has been accepted and mastered by more and more people of the world revolution, promoting the armed struggle of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America to develop vigorously and continuously achieve new victories. The struggles of workers, students, and revolutionary masses in various countries are becoming more intense and widespread, and the surging tide of the revolutionary struggle of the people of the world is higher and more powerful, relentlessly striking the imperialism led by the United States, the modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist clique, and the reactionaries of various countries.

The article further points out that the great victory of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution has made socialist China unprecedentedly strong. The seven hundred million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the most powerful revolutionary force supporting the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries in the world. The great leader of the world revolutionary people, Chairman Mao Zedong, pointed out: "It can be said with certainty that the thorough collapse of colonialism, imperialism, and all exploitative systems, and the thorough liberation of all oppressed peoples and oppressed nations, is not far off."

The article points out that the Thai people's revolutionary struggle is a part of the world revolution in the great era of Mao Zedong. Our revolutionary struggle is not isolated; the peoples of neighboring countries such as China, Vietnam, Laos, Burma, and Malaya, and the revolutionary peoples of various countries in the world, all support us and stand on our side.

The article states that based on the victories of the armed struggle over the past three years and the excellent situation at home and abroad, as long as the Thai people mobilize and unite under the leadership of the Thai Communist Party, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely carry out the armed struggle to the end, launch a sustained and fierce attack on U.S. imperialism and the Thanon-Babbo clique, the final victory will definitely belong to the Thai people.

　　“泰国人民之声”号召泰国人民在泰共领导下
　　建立农村根据地　坚持进行人民战争
　　用农村包围城市　最后夺取全国政权
    新华社八日讯　“泰国人民之声”电台七日广播一篇文章，热烈欢呼泰国共产党领导泰国人民进行革命武装斗争，三年来所取得的辉煌胜利。文章号召泰国人民在泰国共产党领导下，建立农村根据地，坚持进行人民战争，用农村包围城市，最后夺取全国政权。
    文章说，泰国人民武装斗争的胜利发展，使泰国的革命形势空前大好。它沉重地打击着美帝国主义和他侬—巴博卖国政权，从根本上动摇了它们的反动统治，使它们的地位更加不稳固。
    文章说，人民武装斗争的胜利，在人民群众中，越来越发生深远的影响。这正象泰国共产党所指出的，人民武装斗争的初步胜利，不仅证明了美帝国主义和他侬—巴博集团都是纸老虎，人民完全能够打败它，还在于它具有伟大的意义，它宣告泰国人民的革命斗争已经跨进新的阶段，它为全国人民树立了榜样，激发和推动泰国人民革命斗争迅速向前发展。
    文章指出，泰国人民武装斗争的星火能够在敌人的疯狂“围剿”中，继续存在，并以燎原之势，迅速蔓延到三十个府的广大地区。这是由于泰国人民武装斗争，是在泰国共产党领导下的人民战争，坚决贯彻执行了马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的政治路线和军事路线，运用了世界革命人民的伟大导师毛泽东主席关于人民战争的战略战术。由于人民武装是真正的人民军队，全心全意为人民服务，为民族和人民的解放事业而斗争，获得了人民群众的真心实意的支持。
    文章说，泰国革命形势迅速向前发展，证明了泰国共产党的路线、方针、政策非常正确，是坚持以当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想为指南，同泰国革命实践相结合，是符合泰国革命的实际情况和广大人民的要求的。
    文章说，泰国共产党给泰国人民指出，美帝国主义和他侬—巴博卖国集团是泰国民族和人民的敌人。人民要清除这两个敌人，争取独立、民主和安居乐业，就只有团结起来，组成广泛的爱国民主统一战线，同敌人进行各种方式的斗争，互相配合，互相支持，尤其是要进行武装斗争，动员农民群众，建立农村根据地，坚持进行人民战争，用农村包围城市，最后夺取全国政权。这就是遵循毛泽东主席的教导：“枪杆子里面出政权”。“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。这个马克思列宁主义的革命原则是普遍地对的，不论在中国在外国，一概都是对的。”“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”
    文章指出，三年来，泰国人民武装斗争取得的辉煌胜利，使所有爱国民主人民和一切被压迫、被剥削的人民感到欢欣鼓舞，感到无比自豪。但是，这个胜利只不过是万里革命征途的第一步。在革命征途上，还有不少困难和障碍需要我们去克服。正如泰国共产党所指出：泰国人民正在进行的斗争，是正义的斗争，有前途，一定会取得最后的胜利。但是，由于目前敌人的力量还暂时占优势，我们还得经历一段艰苦、曲折和长期的斗争。
    文章说，尽管武装斗争道路上还有不少困难，但是，由于有泰国共产党的领导，有战无不胜的毛泽东思想这一强大思想武器作为斗争指针，有广大人民群众的支持，有人民武装和人民的坚定勇敢的战斗精神，天大的困难都是能够克服的。
    文章指出，目前国际形势大好，毛泽东思想这一反对帝国主义，反对修正主义和反对反动派的强大思想武器，已经为越来越多的世界革命人民所接受和掌握，推动了亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民武装斗争如火如荼地发展，不断取得新的胜利。世界各国的工人、学生和革命人民群众的斗争，更激烈广泛地开展，全世界革命人民的斗争洪流一浪高于一浪，日益猛烈地冲击着以美国为首的帝国主义、以苏修叛徒集团为中心的现代修正主义和各国反动派。
    文章接着指出，中国无产阶级文化大革命取得的伟大胜利，使社会主义的中国空前强大。用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民是最有力地支援世界各国人民革命斗争的伟大革命力量。世界革命人民的伟大导师毛泽东主席指出：“可以肯定，殖民主义、帝国主义和一切剥削制度的彻底崩溃，世界上一切被压迫人民、被压迫民族的彻底翻身，已经为期不远了。”
    文章指出，泰国人民的革命斗争是在伟大的毛泽东时代的世界革命的一个部分。我们的革命斗争并不孤立，中国、越南、老挝、缅甸、马来亚等邻国的人民和世界各国革命人民都支持我们，站在我们一边。
    文章说，在三年来的武装斗争胜利基础上，在国际国内如此大好形势下，只要泰国人民动员起来，团结起来，在泰国共产党领导下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决把武装斗争进行到底，向美帝国主义和他侬—巴博集团发动持久、猛烈的进攻，最后胜利一定属于泰国人民。
