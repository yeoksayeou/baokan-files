U.S. imperialism's lackeys in India and Japan have intensified their collusion in recent days, following the dictates of their master, in a futile attempt to form an anti-China alliance with India and Japan as its core.

The chairman of India's ruling Congress Party, Nijalingappa, engaged in conspiratorial activities in Japan in late July. On August 1, he brazenly declared in Tokyo: "India and Japan can influence other countries in Asia." Upon his return to New Delhi on August 7, he more blatantly revealed that Japan, "Malaysia," Thailand, and other lackeys of U.S. imperialism in Asia have further recognized the need to strengthen their collusion with the Indian reactionary government to jointly oppose China.

The statements by the head of the Indian Congress Party exposed the new conspiracy of U.S. imperialism to use Indian reactionaries to form an anti-China alliance.

According to the Indian bourgeois publication "Link" weekly on August 4, during recent secret talks between the governments of the U.S. and India, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Katzenbach stated that the U.S. government can help some Asian countries "form a large alliance supported by the United States" to oppose China.

During his activities in Japan, Nijalingappa had secret talks with Japanese Prime Minister Sato Eisaku, the Secretary-General of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party Fukuda Takeo, and some Japanese monopolists.

According to Nijalingappa on August 7, the Japanese reactionaries hope to establish "economic relations" with the Indian reactionaries in the same way they have conducted economic collusion with the Soviet revisionist renegade clique. Recently, the Soviet revisionists betrayed national interests by allowing Japanese monopolist capital to infiltrate Siberia and simultaneously supplying the Japanese reactionaries with the timber they lack. The chairman of the Indian Congress Party stated that India should also follow this method, accepting Japan's "economic aid" and supplying Japan with ore. The Soviet revisionists and the Indian reactionaries are actually helping Japanese monopolist capital expand economically and plunder industrial raw materials, accelerating the revival of Japanese militarism.

The governments of India and Japan have established a consultative committee to strengthen their collusion, which will hold its fourth meeting in October this year. Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi will visit Japan at the end of October. Subsequently, Japanese Prime Minister Sato will also visit India.

　　美帝走卒印度和日本反动派加紧勾结
　　印国大党主席到日本活动妄图拼凑反华联盟
    新华社八日讯　新德里消息：美帝国主义在亚洲的两个走卒——印度和日本反动政府，最近按照它们的主子的意旨加紧勾结，妄图以印度、日本为核心拼凑反华联盟。
    印度执政党国大党主席尼贾林加帕在七月下旬到日本进行了阴谋活动。他八月一日在东京狂妄地宣称：“印度和日本可以影响亚洲的其它国家。”他七日回到新德里时，更加露骨地透露，日本、“马来西亚”、泰国等美帝国主义在亚洲的走卒，已进一步认识到有必要同印度反动政府加强勾结，合伙反对中国。
    印度国大党头子的这些言论，泄露了美帝国主义利用印度反动派拼凑反华联盟的新阴谋。
    据印度资产阶级刊物《联系》周刊四日透露，在美、印两国政府最近举行的秘密会谈中，美国副国务卿卡曾巴赫表示，美国政府可以帮助亚洲一些国家“结成一种得到美国支持的大联盟”来反对中国。
    尼贾林加帕在日本活动期间，曾经同日本首相佐藤荣作、日本执政党自由民主党干事长福田赳夫和日本的一些垄断资本家密谈。
    据尼贾林加帕七日透露，日本反动派希望按照它同苏修叛徒集团之间进行经济勾结的办法，同印度反动派建立“经济关系”。最近苏修出卖民族利益，允许日本垄断资本渗入西伯利亚，同时向日本反动派供应日本所缺乏的木材。印度国大党主席表示，印度也应当按照这种办法，接受日本的经济“援助”，并向日本供应矿砂。苏修和印度反动派实际上都是帮助日本垄断资本进行经济扩张和掠夺工业原料，加速复活日本军国主义。
    印度和日本政府为了加强勾结，已经建立了一个协商委员会，它将在今年十月间举行第四次会议。印度总理英迪拉·甘地将在十月底访问日本。随后，日本首相佐藤也将访问印度。
