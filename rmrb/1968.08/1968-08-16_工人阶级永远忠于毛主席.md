The *People's Daily* and *Liberation Army Daily* in the editorial "Warmly Congratulate the Establishment of the Yunnan Provincial Revolutionary Committee" conveyed the latest instructions from the great leader Chairman Mao: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully bring into play the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in all work. The working class should also continuously raise its political consciousness in the struggle." Upon hearing this great news, the Beijing Workers and Peasants Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team was overjoyed and deeply moved. The soldiers of each brigade, with the fastest speed and the highest enthusiasm, held various forms of celebration activities overnight, propagating and studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The soldiers, with boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, held high the red book of Chairman Mao's quotations, carried Chairman Mao's portrait, beat drums and gongs, shouted slogans, and held parades. The soldiers of each brigade also used various forms of propaganda to deliver Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the broad masses, teachers and staff, students, and family members, making them known to every household and every person. Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! The working class of the capital, who are infinitely loyal to you, have so many heartfelt words to say to you, so many passionate songs to sing to you. Ten thousand songs and ten thousand words converge into the strongest voice of the times: Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live!

It is already past three in the morning, and the study and discussion meetings of each brigade, company, platoon, and squad are still being held enthusiastically. Everyone is studying and reciting Chairman Mao's latest instructions over and over again, hungry for knowledge. The workers are studying even more seriously, engraving Chairman Mao's teachings word by word in their hearts. Everyone unanimously believes that Chairman Mao's latest instructions have given the most profound, most brilliant, and most correct evaluation of the working class. This is the greatest encouragement, greatest trust, greatest education, and greatest spur for the working class. It is Chairman Mao's great development of Marxism-Leninism on the theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The great leader Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "The entire history of the revolution proves that without the leadership of the working class, the revolution will fail; with the leadership of the working class, the revolution will succeed." The working class is the most far-sighted, selfless, and most thoroughly revolutionary. In every historical period of the Chinese revolution, the working class has always stood at the forefront of the revolutionary struggle, uniting its allies, and bravely fighting against domestic and foreign enemies, achieving one great victory after another. At the crucial moment of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao once again clearly pointed out, "The working class is the leading class. We must fully bring into play the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in all work." This has even greater profound and far-reaching significance.

During the discussion, many old workers, with tears in their eyes, excitedly said: In the old society, we workers were like oxen and horses, suffering from class exploitation and oppression, and had no political status at all. Chairman Mao led us poor people to make a revolution, overthrowing the three big mountains, and we workers were liberated, becoming the masters of the state and the leading class of the revolution and construction. Now, Chairman Mao has issued new instructions, giving us workers new tasks and requirements. We workers listen to Chairman Mao the most, are the most loyal to him, and follow him the closest. Chairman Mao supports us, and we workers will definitely make Chairman Mao proud!

Everyone solemnly vowed: Forever loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, forever loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, learning from Comrade Lei Feng's shining example, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, playing a leading role in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in all work, resolutely and swiftly implementing Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, "continuously raising our political consciousness in the struggle," while transforming the objective world, criticizing and repudiating revisionism, transforming the subjective world, continuously raising our class struggle and line struggle consciousness, closely uniting around the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, under the command of the proletarian headquarters, unifying our thinking, unifying our steps, and unifying our actions. We must thoroughly criticize the reactionary "theory of multiple centers," resolutely smash all the tricks and schemes of the class enemies who attempt to split the proletarian headquarters, overthrow rightist splitism, and defend to the death the great leader Chairman Mao, defend to the death the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and defend to the death Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!

We will definitely follow the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, "believe in and rely on the masses," together with the revolutionary Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and staff of Tsinghua University, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's series of great instructions on the educational revolution, fully implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, carry the educational revolution of the proletariat through to the end, and truly make Tsinghua University into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought, a new-type university of the proletariat, and let the invincible red flag of Mao Zedong Thought fly high forever in the sky of Tsinghua University!

    工人阶级永远忠于毛主席
    首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队
    《人民日报》、《解放军报》在《热烈欢呼云南省革命委员会成立》的社论中，传达了伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”我们首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队听到这一特大喜讯后，人人欣喜若狂，个个激动万分。各团战士，以最快的速度、最高的热情，连夜举行各种形式的庆祝活动，宣传、学习毛主席的最新指示。战士们满怀对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠诚，手捧红彤彤的毛主席语录，抬着毛主席画像，敲锣打鼓，高呼口号，举行游行。各团战士还采用各种宣传形式，把毛主席最新指示及时地送到了广大群众、教职员工、学生、家属的手里，使之家喻户晓，人人皆知。毛主席啊，毛主席！无限忠于您老人家的首都工人阶级有多少贴心的话儿要对您讲，有多少热情的歌儿要对您唱，千歌万曲，万语千言，汇成一句时代的最强音：毛主席万岁！万万岁！
    已是凌晨三点多钟了，各团、连、排、班的座谈会、学习讨论会，仍在热烈地进行。大家一遍一遍如饥似渴地认真学习、背诵毛主席最新指示，工人们学习得更是认真，一字一句地把毛主席的教导铭刻在心。大家一致认为：毛主席的最新指示，对我们工人阶级做了最深刻、最英明、最正确的估价，这是对我们工人阶级的最大鼓舞、最大信任、最大教育、最大鞭策，是毛主席对马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级专政学说的伟大发展。伟大领袖毛主席早就指出：“整个革命历史证明，没有工人阶级的领导，革命就要失败，有了工人阶级的领导，革命就胜利了。”工人阶级最有远见，大公无私，最富于彻底的革命精神。在中国革命的各个历史时期，工人阶级总是站在革命斗争的最前列，团结自己的同盟军，同国内外敌人英勇奋战，取得了一个又一个的伟大胜利。在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的关键时刻，毛主席再一次明确指出，“工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。”更有伟大而深远的意义。
    在讨论中，许多老工人含着泪花激动地说：在旧社会，咱们工人做牛做马，受尽阶级剥削和阶级压迫之苦，根本没有什么政治地位。毛主席领导咱穷人闹革命，推翻了三座大山，咱们工人才翻了身，做了国家的主人，成为革命和建设的领导阶级。现在，毛主席又发出最新指示，向我们工人阶级提出了新的任务和要求。咱们工人最听毛主席的话，对毛主席最忠，跟毛主席最紧。毛主席他老人家给我们撑腰，我们工人一定要为毛主席争气！
    大家庄严地宣誓：永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的革命路线，以门合同志为光辉榜样，活学活用毛主席著作，在文化大革命中和一切工作中起主力军作用，最坚决、最迅速地落实毛主席一系列最新指示，“在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟”，在改造客观世界的同时，斗私批修，改造主观世界，不断提高阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，紧紧团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部周围，在无产阶级司令部的号令下统一认识、统一步伐、统一行动。我们要彻底批判反动的“多中心论”，坚决粉碎阶级敌人妄图分裂无产阶级司令部的一切阴谋诡计，打倒右倾分裂主义，誓死捍卫伟大领袖毛主席，誓死捍卫战无不胜的毛泽东思想，誓死捍卫毛主席的革命路线！
    我们一定遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，“要相信和依靠群众”，同清华大学革命的红卫兵小将和革命师生员工一起，坚决贯彻执行毛主席关于教育革命的一系列伟大指示，全面落实毛主席一系列最新指示，把无产阶级教育革命进行到底，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把清华大学真正办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校，办成无产阶级的新型大学，让战无不胜的毛泽东思想伟大红旗在清华园的上空高高飘扬，永远飘扬！
