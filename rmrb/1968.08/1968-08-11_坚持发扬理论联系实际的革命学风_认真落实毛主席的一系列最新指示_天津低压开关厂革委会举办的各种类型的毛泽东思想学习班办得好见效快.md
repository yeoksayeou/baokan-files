The various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes organized by the Revolutionary Committee of the Tianjin Low-Voltage Switch Factory are well-run and effective.

According to the Xinhua News Agency in Tianjin, the various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes organized by the Revolutionary Committee of the Tianjin Low-Voltage Switch Factory persist in promoting the revolutionary learning style of combining theory with practice, seriously implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and effectively promote the thought revolutionization of the workers. The entire factory is in a vibrant and inspiring situation of revolution and production.

After the Revolutionary Committee of the Low-Voltage Switch Factory was established at the end of last year, the first thing they did was to organize and run various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and they regarded this work as the primary task of the Revolutionary Committee. So far, they have adopted the method of combining factory-organized and team-organized classes, holding seven sessions of Mao Zedong Thought study classes centered on implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They have also held more than thirty sessions of specialized Mao Zedong Thought study classes focused on resolving various active thoughts. Almost all revolutionary workers in the factory have attended more than five sessions of these study classes.

The factory-organized Mao Zedong Thought study classes adopt the method of "three grasps and three combinations" to closely link theory with practice, learn and apply simultaneously, and achieve immediate results.

First, seriously implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, combine the direction of the revolutionary struggle with raising the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad revolutionary workers.

Practice has proven that in the process of implementing each of Chairman Mao's instructions, a handful of class enemies hate it to death and fear it to death. They vigorously incite rightist or ultra-leftist trends to disrupt and sabotage Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. In response to this situation, the Revolutionary Committee of the Low-Voltage Switch Factory has, over the past half year, organized seven sessions of Mao Zedong Thought study classes centered on implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, including topics such as "Overthrowing bourgeois factionalism, consolidating revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination," "Fighting against anarchist trends, promoting revolution and production," "Opposing right-opportunism, right-capitulationism, and right-splittism, smashing the rightist reversal wind, and never forgetting class struggle," "Launching revolutionary criticism, and doing a good job in cleaning up the class ranks," and "Strengthening the construction of the revolutionary committee and implementing streamlined administration."

The factory had accepted the task of trial-producing the advanced product "three-level air switch" in 1964, but due to the obstruction of the bourgeois old framework, it failed after several years of effort. In the Mao Zedong Thought study class focused on implementing Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," the masses used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to fiercely criticize the revisionist black goods peddled by China's Khrushchev, such as "expert management," "technology first," and "profit-oriented." This further strengthened their proletarian feelings of being loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Many old workers expressed: Chairman Mao trusts us the most, understands us the most, and supports us the most. We will not disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations and will definitely produce this product to make Chairman Mao proud and bring glory to the country. They held the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and marched to the battlefield of trial-producing new products. After two months of effort, they successfully trial-produced this advanced product and put it into production.

Second, grasp active thoughts, combine running comprehensive study classes to raise the proletarian consciousness of the masses with running specialized study classes to specifically resolve various active thoughts, and continuously promote the revolution and production to develop in depth.

In the course of carrying out the struggle against the enemy, the Revolutionary Committee of the Low-Voltage Switch Factory first organized a Mao Zedong Thought study class focused on "opposing right-opportunism, right-capitulationism, and right-splittism, smashing the rightist reversal wind, and never forgetting class struggle." They organized workers to study Chairman Mao's statements on class and class struggle, resolving the thoughts of relaxation that arose after the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, and raising the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad workers. Subsequently, the Revolutionary Committee also organized several different types of specialized Mao Zedong Thought study classes in response to the active thoughts of the masses. For example, they organized a study class on "not relying on past merits but striving for new achievements," organizing some old rebels to study Chairman Mao's teachings: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and its leadership of the broad revolutionary people and the reactionary Kuomintang. It is a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." "You should care about state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" They helped them overcome the slack and complacent mood, making them revolutionary rebels who decided to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. Through organizing various types of specialized Mao Zedong Thought study classes, the masses raised their class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness, quickly launching a mass movement of exposing and struggling against a handful of class enemies, and rooting out the class enemies hiding in various corners.

Third, grasp the revolutionary learning style of combining theory with practice, combine criticizing revisionism with fighting selfishness, and guide the broad workers to strive to transform their worldview.

In February and March of this year, some workers in the factory were influenced by the anarchist trend in society and temporarily showed signs of relaxed discipline. The factory Revolutionary Committee then organized a "grasp revolution, promote production" Mao Zedong Thought study class, mobilizing the masses to expose the crimes of anarchism, list the harms of anarchism, and dig out the roots of anarchism. They fiercely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of China's Khrushchev and fought against the "self" in their minds. Many workers, in light of Chairman Mao's great teachings of "grasp revolution, promote production," fiercely fought against their selfishness and consciously used Mao Zedong Thought to fight against all phenomena that disrupt labor discipline and democratic centralism. From April onwards, the factory's labor attendance rate was consistently maintained at around 90%, reaching over 95% in June and July.

The Tianjin Low-Voltage Switch Factory's organization of various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, promoting Chairman Mao's revolutionary learning style, has promoted the thought revolutionization of the workers and effectively promoted the revolution and production. Since this year, the factory has exceeded the state production plan every month.

　　坚持发扬理论联系实际的革命学风
　　认真落实毛主席的一系列最新指示
　　天津低压开关厂革委会举办的各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班办得好见效快
    据新华社天津十日电  天津低压开关厂革命委员会举办的各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，坚持发扬理论联系实际的革命学风，认真落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，有力地促进了职工的思想革命化，全厂革命和生产出现一派振奋人心的大好形势。
    低压开关厂革命委员会在去年年底成立以后，抓的第一件事，就是大办、办好各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，并且把做好这项工作，作为革委会的首要任务。到目前为止，他们采取厂办和班组办相结合的办法，办了七期以落实毛主席的最新指示为中心内容的毛泽东思想学习班，还办了三十多种很多期以解决各种活思想为内容的专题毛泽东思想学习班。全厂革命职工差不多都到学习班学习过五次以上。
    这个厂办毛泽东思想学习班，采取“三抓三结合”的办法，使理论密切联系实际，学了就用，学用结合，立竿见影。
    一，认真落实毛主席的最新指示，把抓革命斗争大方向，同提高广大革命职工阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟结合起来。
    实践证明，在落实毛主席每一项指示的过程中，一小撮阶级敌人恨得要死，怕得要命，他们极力煽动右的或极“左”的思潮，干扰和破坏毛主席的伟大战略部署。针对这种情况，低压开关厂革委会半年多来围绕落实毛主席的最新指示，先后举办了以“打倒资产阶级派性，巩固革命大联合、革命三结合”，“大反无政府主义思潮，抓革命促生产”，“反对右倾机会主义、右倾投降主义、右倾分裂主义，粉碎右倾翻案妖风，千万不要忘记阶级斗争”，
  “开展革命大批判，搞好清理阶级队伍工作”，“加强革命委员会的建设，实行精兵简政”等为内容的七期毛泽东思想学习班。这个厂在一九六四年曾接受试制尖端产品“三级空气开关”的任务，但因为受资产阶级旧框框的阻碍，搞了好几年没有成功。在以落实毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针为内容的毛泽东思想学习班上，广大群众以毛泽东思想为武器，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫贩卖的“专家治厂”、“技术第一”、“利润挂帅”等修正主义黑货，进一步增强了无限忠于毛主席革命路线的无产阶级感情。很多老工人表示：毛主席最相信我们，最了解我们，最支持我们，我们决不辜负毛主席的期望，一定要把这个产品搞出来，为毛主席争气，为祖国争光。他们手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，走向试制新产品的战场，经过两个月的努力，就把这个尖端产品试制成功，投入生产了。
    二，抓活思想，把办好综合性学习班，提高广大群众的无产阶级觉悟，和办好专题性学习班，有的放矢地解决各种活思想结合起来，不断推动革命和生产向纵深发展。
    在开展对敌斗争中，低压开关厂革委会首先举办以“反对右倾机会主义、右倾投降主义、右倾分裂主义，粉碎右倾翻案妖风，千万不要忘记阶级斗争”为内容的毛泽东思想学习班，组织职工学习毛主席有关阶级和阶级斗争的论述，解决他们在革委会建立以后产生的松一口气的思想，提高了广大职工的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。接着，革委会又针对群众中的活思想，举办了几种不同类型的专题毛泽东思想学习班。例如：举办“不要吃老本，要立新功”学习班，组织一些老造反派学习毛主席的教导：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”帮助他们克服松劲麻痹情绪，使他们振奋革命精神，作决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派。通过大办各种类型的专题毛泽东思想学习班，广大群众提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，迅速掀起了一个群众性的对一小撮阶级敌人大揭发、大斗争的高潮，把隐藏在各个角落的阶级敌人挖了出来。
    三，抓理论联系实际的革命学风，把批修和斗私结合起来，引导广大职工努力改造世界观。
    今年二、三月份，厂子里有些工人因受社会上无政府主义思潮的影响，一度出现纪律松弛的现象，厂革委会便举办了“抓革命，促生产”毛泽东思想学习班，发动群众大摆无政府主义的罪状，大列无政府主义的危害，大挖无政府主义的毒根，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫推行的反革命修正主义路线，狠斗自己头脑里的“私”字。不少职工对照毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大教导，狠斗了自己的私心，自觉地用毛泽东思想同一切破坏劳动纪律、破坏民主集中制的现象作斗争。从四月份起，全厂劳动出勤率经常保持在百分之九十左右，六、七月份达到百分之九十五以上。
    天津低压开关厂大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，发扬毛主席倡导的革命学风，促进了职工思想革命化，有力地推动了革命和生产，今年以来，全厂月月超额完成国家生产计划。
