The joyous news of the birth of the Revolutionary Committees of Fujian Province and Fuzhou City has greatly encouraged the broad masses of soldiers and civilians across the country who are earnestly implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and striving for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. With hearts brimming with excitement, they enthusiastically acclaim the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the further consolidation and strengthening of proletarian dictatorship on the frontline of national defense in southeastern China. The broad masses of soldiers and civilians express that, under the great strategic deployment of the Proletarian Headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, they will fully exert the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work, swiftly organize propaganda teams of Mao Zedong Thought with workers as the main body and with the participation of the People's Liberation Army, and step by step go to schools and to all units that have not yet carried out the struggle, criticism, and reform well, earnestly carry out the educational revolution and the struggle, criticism, and reform in all domains of the superstructure, and push the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

Today, from Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin to all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, the broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat, revolutionary masses, and PLA soldiers and officers are holding celebration meetings or discussion meetings, enthusiastically celebrating the glorious birth of the Revolutionary Committees of Fujian Province and Fuzhou City, and enthusiastically acclaiming this as another great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and another great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line! Revolutionary Committees of various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have sent congratulatory telegrams to the Revolutionary Committees of Fujian Province and Fuzhou City. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in various places point out that the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of Fujian Province has made the iron wall of the southeastern gate of the motherland even more impregnable, which is a heavy blow to American imperialism and its running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and also a heavy blow to all reactionaries at home and abroad; it has great strategic significance for consolidating our national defense and strengthening the proletarian dictatorship. The broad revolutionary masses of Zhejiang Province, who have always fought side by side with the railway workers on the frontline of Fujian, the broad revolutionary workers of the Nanchang Railway Bureau, the "Red Vanguard Company" of the Guangzhou Garrison, and the PLA soldiers and officers who stand guard day and night at the frontline of aid to Vietnam and anti-American struggle in Yunnan-Guangxi, are even more elated upon hearing the news of the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of Fujian Province. They say, "The day the people are happy is the day the counter-revolutionaries are miserable." The enemy will not readily accept their defeat. We must learn from the military and civilian people of Fujian, unite closely with the military and civilian people of Fujian Province and the people of the whole country, and be a hundred times more vigilant, strengthen our preparedness, and resolutely, thoroughly, completely, and entirely annihilate all enemies who dare to invade, to defend our socialist motherland.

Many regions' revolutionary masses of the proletariat, revolutionary masses, and PLA soldiers and officers, while enthusiastically celebrating the glorious establishment of the Revolutionary Committees of Fujian Province and Fuzhou City, have further studied Chairman Mao's recent instructions: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully exert the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work. The working class should also continuously raise its political consciousness in the struggle," and the editorial "Unite and Struggle Against the Enemy" from the People's Daily and the Liberation Army Daily. They reviewed the experience and achievements of organizing workers and peasants Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams. They pointed out that, according to Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, organizing propaganda teams of Mao Zedong Thought with workers as the main body and with the participation of PLA soldiers and officers, and step by step going to schools and to all units that have not yet carried out the struggle, criticism, and reform well, is a great revolutionary innovation. Under the leadership of the Proletarian Headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, fully exerting the leading role of the working class will definitely enable us to continuously advance and more quickly achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The capital workers and peasants Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed in Tsinghua University has, in just over twenty days, achieved remarkable results in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and promoting revolutionary unity. The revolutionary Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students of Tsinghua University praised that the capital workers and peasants Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team is the vanguard of enthusiastically propagating Mao Zedong Thought, a model of closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and an example of fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

The workers and peasants Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team that entered the Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical College has consecutively helped the two revolutionary factions hold three Mao Zedong Thought study classes, implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. In the past two days, many departments and sections of this hospital have leveled the hills and achieved revolutionary unity by unit, by department, paving the way for carrying out the struggle, criticism, and reform.

Many comrades who participated in the workers and peasants Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams in various places said with deep feelings when reviewing the achievements they had already made that, in a word, listen to Chairman Mao's words, believe in and rely on the broad revolutionary masses, unite and struggle against the enemy, this is the first thing. They said, we all have a heart that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao. As long as we always and in everything take Mao Zedong Thought as our guide and closely unite with the broad revolutionary masses, we will definitely be able to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The broad revolutionary teachers and students of Beijing Institute of Building Materials, which has recently established a revolutionary committee, today enthusiastically welcomed the capital workers Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team that entered the school.

The responsible comrades of the Provincial Workers' Congress and the Changsha Municipal Workers' Congress, the members of the Revolutionary Committee of Chengdu Instrument Factory, and the PLA's on-site support personnel all expressed that, under the leadership of the Proletarian Headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, strengthening the unity between the military and the civilians, strengthening the unity between the revolutionary committees and the broad revolutionary masses, and strengthening the unity within the revolutionary committees are the fundamental guarantees for achieving a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution. They expressed that they will definitely thoroughly criticize the reactionary "multi-center theory," strengthen the unity among the people, and accurately and resolutely strike at a small handful of class enemies, developing the good situation of the Cultural Revolution.

When the joyous news reached the old Red Army regiment of the PLA stationed in a certain place in Hefei, the broad soldiers and officers excitedly said that the glorious birth of the Revolutionary Committee of Fujian Province once again tells us a revolutionary truth: the Proletarian Headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin is the leadership center of the whole Party, the whole army, and the people of the whole country. We closely unite around this leadership center and can advance from victory to new victories.
