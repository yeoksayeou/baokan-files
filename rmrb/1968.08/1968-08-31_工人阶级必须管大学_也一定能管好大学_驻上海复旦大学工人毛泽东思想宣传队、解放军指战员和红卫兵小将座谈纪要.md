The east wind is sweeping, and good news is frequent. In the midst of the triumphant songs of the nationwide Cultural Revolution, our great leader Chairman Mao has recently issued an extremely important directive: "To achieve a proletarian educational revolution, it is necessary for the working class to lead and for the working-class masses to participate, in cooperation with the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, to form a revolutionary triad with the students, teachers, and workers in the school who are determined to carry the proletarian educational revolution to the end. The workers' propaganda teams must stay in the schools for a long time to participate in all the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and to lead the schools permanently. In the countryside, schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants."

The workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams that have just entered Fudan University in Shanghai, the military training team of the Air Force stationed on campus, and the revolutionary Red Guards have studied and understood Chairman Mao's latest directives over and over again. They have also read and discussed the important article by Comrade Yao Wenyuan, "The Working Class Must Lead Everything." Below is a summary of their discussion:

**The Working Class Must Manage Universities**

Comrade Tan Qitai, a member of the Fudan University Revolutionary Committee and a Red Guard, said: Chairman Mao's latest directives have pointed out the most correct direction and path for the proletarian educational revolution. The practice of the Cultural Revolution has told us that schools must be led by the working class to carry the educational revolution to the end. Today, Chairman Mao has personally sent the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to our university. This is a turning point in Fudan's history. Seeing the workers come, we are genuinely happy. We are determined, under the leadership of the working class, to work together with the workers and the PLA to thoroughly bury the bourgeois educational system and carry the proletarian educational revolution to the end!

Deputy Political Commissar Tang Jinwen of the Fudan University Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team said: We have listened to and read Chairman Mao's latest directives over and over again. Chairman Mao and the working class share the same heart! In the past, I also wanted to enter a university and did enter one. Was it to study? No. In the old society controlled by the bourgeoisie, I couldn't even eat, how could I afford to study? In the past, I picked up balls for those foreign students and "young masters" wearing glasses to earn a few coins to maintain my life. Before liberation, why did we suffer? Wasn't it because we had no power! After liberation, under the protection of the Chinese Khrushchev, a handful of bad guys still controlled the leadership of the schools, oppressing us. These bad guys fiercely opposed the working class leading the schools, attempting to turn the schools into their frontline positions for restoring capitalism and into their bases for cultivating bourgeois successors. In a word, they attempted to overthrow proletarian dictatorship and make us suffer twice. We will not allow it! We must firmly grasp the leadership of the universities in the hands of the working class, making the sky of the university the sky of Mao Zedong Thought, making the land of the university the land of Mao Zedong Thought, and making the people of the university people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. We vow to transform Fudan University into a bright red Mao Zedong Thought university!

**We Must Reverse the Upside-Down History**

Old worker Shen Mingxing, a member of the Fudan University Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, said: Chinese Khrushchev and his agents spread all kinds of reactionary fallacies, saying things like "workers have no knowledge" and "schools are different from industrial departments," forcibly taking the leadership of the schools from our hands and giving it to their sons and grandsons, allowing a group of bad guys to oppress us. Chairman Mao issued the latest directives, instructing us, the working class, to "permanently lead the schools," to reverse the history of "scholars ruling and laborers being ruled" thoroughly. This is the great historical mission given to us by Chairman Mao. We will not disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations and will definitely shoulder this responsibility well!

A proletarian school must be led by the proletariat. The successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause can only be cultivated by the proletariat themselves. The leadership of education, which is related to the fate and future of the country, must be in our hands. Who else should manage it?! Should we let the bourgeoisie manage it? No! Absolutely not!

We workers not only manage factories and machines but also manage schools and education, and we will manage the entire country and the world. The working class must manage everything!

Red Guard Wang Shiqing, a student at Fudan University, said: We are children of the working people, with the resolve to learn knowledge to serve socialist construction, stepping into the school gates. However, over the past decade, what we have heard, seen, and learned in school has made me very disappointed. In school, we cannot find true teachers or learn truly useful knowledge. Those guiding our studies are the bourgeois "authorities," and we learn the decayed and declining rubbish of the feudal, bourgeois, and revisionist line. Today, the working class has entered Fudan, and I am extremely moved. Chairman Mao has sent the working class to break through the deep walls of the high-level institutions controlled by the bourgeoisie, solemnly declaring that the working class should lead the schools and lead them permanently! From now on, our true teachers have permanently entered the school. In the past, we were students of the bourgeois "authorities," but in the future, we will sincerely be lifelong students of the working class.

**The Working Class Will Certainly Manage Universities Well**

Comrade Guo Sanzhen, deputy commander of the Fudan University Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team and an active learner of Mao Zedong Thought in Shanghai, said: Navigating the sea relies on the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. With Mao Zedong Thought, we have everything. We workers are the most loyal to Chairman Mao, with the reddest hearts and the brightest eyes. With Chairman Mao backing us and Mao Zedong Thought guiding us, we fear nothing and nothing is difficult for us!

Of course, I know that after entering the university, we will encounter difficulties, twists and turns, and struggles. However, as long as we firmly act according to Chairman Mao's directives, firmly rely on the revolutionary Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students, with the support and help of the PLA soldiers, we will definitely manage the university well and carry out the educational revolution well.

Commander Yuan Chunhua of the Fourth Company, Fudan University Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, said: Some people say, "Workers have no knowledge, don't understand education, and can't manage universities." I say, no! What's so great about a university! With over 9.6 million square kilometers of land and 700 million people, we workers can manage China, so what's so difficult about managing a few universities!

Under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, the Chinese working class and hundreds of millions of laboring people drove away the foreign invaders who occupied our country, overthrew the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek regime, and established New China; in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we smashed the bourgeois headquarters led by Chinese Khrushchev and shattered their dream of restoring capitalism. Practice has proven that those who are truly incapable are not the working class but those bourgeois intellectuals who like to put on airs.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The most intelligent and most talented are those with the most practical experience." This is the truth. Our factory has six such workers; they have never attended any university, yet, relying on their hearts that are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, they manufactured a marking machine urgently needed for production in a situation with no blueprints, no data, and no samples. When this marking machine was put into production, two so-called "authoritative" engineers from outside rushed in. They copied the workers' marking machine to draw the blueprints, but after returning, they could not manufacture the marking machine. Look! Two so-called "authorities" turned out to be two big fools and big eaters! Those who do not believe that workers can manage universities well, let's see!

Soldier He Peizhen of the Air Force Military Training Team stationed at Fudan University said: The working class has the reddest hearts and the brightest eyes, hates all anti-socialist and anti-Mao Zedong Thought counter-revolutionary words and deeds the most, hates the old educational system that serves the exploiting class the most, opposes certain intellectuals' actions of destroying state property and obstructing the struggle, criticism, and transformation of "fighting internal wars" the most, and dislikes the hypocritical and two-faced habits the most. With the leadership of the university in the hands of the working class, Chairman Mao's latest directives can be quickly implemented, and the university can be ensured to be the domain of the proletariat forever.

**Mao Zedong Thought Is Our Guiding Light**

Comrade Guo Sanzhen, deputy commander of the Fudan University Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team and an active learner of Mao Zedong Thought in Shanghai, said: Today, we have entered the school and taken the leadership. What do we rely on to lead and complete the historical mission of struggle, criticism, and transformation? The most fundamental thing is Mao Zedong Thought. After the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team entered Fudan, we must vigorously propagate Mao Zedong Thought, highlight Mao Zedong Thought, and definitely not forget to grasp the two fundamentals. First, we must grasp the study of Mao Zedong Thought. We must first grasp our own study. Only by studying well can we propagate well. We workers must lead in everything, and first of all, we must lead in studying Mao Zedong Thought. We must study each of Chairman Mao's latest directives word by word and sentence by sentence, implement them quickly, and firmly oppose the bourgeois evil academic style of "talking big but not acting accordingly." Second, we must grasp the class struggle and not let it slacken. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Class struggle, once grasped, is effective." Whether or not to grasp the class struggle is the key to whether the working class can long occupy the school. We must severely strike down a handful of traitors, spies, counter-revolutionaries, unrepentant capitalist-roaders, and reactionary bourgeois academic "authorities" who have infiltrated the school, as well as landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who have not been reformed. We must criticize various bourgeois ideas and styles. Only in this way can the working class take root in the school forever and lead the school well. We must also be vigilant against the bourgeois sugar-coated bullets and continuously improve our political awareness and ideological level. As long as we remember Chairman Mao's teachings and never forget the nature of the working class, we will definitely be able to stand firm and steady in the university and definitely be able to complete the glorious mission given to us by Chairman Mao.

**The PLA Vows to Be the Strong Backbone of the Workers**

Soldier Zheng Chaoyang of the Air Force Military Training Team stationed at Fudan University said: The workers' propaganda teams entering the university is a great innovation, marking the end of the era of bourgeois intellectuals ruling the schools and the beginning of the era of the proletariat taking the leadership of education. Fudan University was previously a key school controlled by Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, with class struggle being sharp and complex. Now, the working class has taken the leadership of the school, which is a great change, a great revolution. "The day the people rejoice is the day the counter-revolutionaries suffer." The class enemies will not be willing to fail and will definitely try every means to sabotage and disrupt. Therefore, the class struggle in the future will be more profound and more complex. We, the People's Liberation Army, are the strong pillars of proletarian dictatorship. Chairman Mao loves me, I love Chairman Mao; Chairman Mao supports me, I support Chairman Mao. In the process of the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams staying in the schools for a long time and leading the schools permanently, we will definitely stand on the side of the working class, firmly support all revolutionary actions of the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, and vow to be their strong backbone. In the great battle to achieve the educational revolution, we will unite with the working class, fight with them, and win with them. We will not withdraw until we achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution!

    工人阶级必须管大学　也一定能管好大学
    ——驻上海复旦大学工人毛泽东思想宣传队、解放军指战员和红卫兵小将座谈纪要
    东风浩荡，喜讯频传。在全国无产阶级文化大革命节节胜利的凯歌声中，伟大领袖毛主席最近又发出了极其重要的指示：“实现无产阶级教育革命，必须有工人阶级领导，必须有工人群众参加，配合解放军战士，同学校的学生、教员、工人中决心把无产阶级教育革命进行到底的积极分子实行革命的三结合。工人宣传队要在学校中长期留下去，参加学校中全部斗、批、改任务，并且永远领导学校。在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校。”刚刚进驻上海复旦大学的工人毛泽东思想宣传队和驻校的空军部队军训团，以及革命的红卫兵小将，一遍又一遍地学习、领会毛主席的最新指示，一遍又一遍地阅读姚文元同志的重要文章《工人阶级必须领导一切》，并且举行了座谈。下面是座谈纪要：
        工　人　阶　级　必　须　管　大　学
    复旦大学革命委员会常委、红卫兵小将谭启泰说：毛主席的最新指示，为无产阶级教育革命指出了最正确的方向和道路。文化大革命的实践告诉我们，学校必须由工人阶级来领导，才能把教育革命进行到底。今天，毛主席亲自派来了工人毛泽东思想宣传队，这是我们复旦历史上的转折点。看见工人同志来了，我们打心眼里感到高兴。我们决心在工人阶级的领导下，同工人、解放军一道，彻底埋葬资产阶级教育制度，把无产阶级教育革命进行到底！
    驻复旦大学工人毛泽东思想宣传队副政委唐金文说：毛主席的最新指示，我们听了一遍又一遍，读了一遍又一遍。毛主席和我们工人阶级一个心眼啊！过去我也想进大学，也进过大学。是去读书吗？不是。在资产阶级掌权的旧社会，我连饭都吃不上，怎么能读得起书呢！我过去是给那些戴眼镜的洋学生、“少爷”捡球，挣几个钱来维持生活。解放前，我们为什么受苦受难？还不是因为没有权！解放后，在中国赫鲁晓夫的包庇下，一小撮坏蛋仍然控制着学校的领导大权，专我们的政。这一小撮坏家伙拚命反对工人阶级领导学校，妄图把学校变成他们复辟资本主义的前哨阵地，变成他们培养资产阶级接班人的阵地。一句话，妄图颠覆无产阶级专政，叫我们吃二遍苦，受二遍罪。我们决不答应！我们必须把领导大学的权紧紧地掌握在工人阶级手里，要叫大学的天变成毛泽东思想的天，要让大学的地变成毛泽东思想的地，要让大学的人变成毛泽东思想武装起来的人，誓把复旦大学改造成一所红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校！
    必须把被颠倒的历史重新颠倒过来
    驻复旦大学工人毛泽东思想宣传队队员、老工人沈明兴说：中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人散布种种反动谬论，说什么“工人没有知识”，“学校不同于工业部门”，等等，硬把领导学校的大权从我们手中夺去，交 给他的孝子贤孙，让一群坏蛋专我们的政。毛主席发出最新指示，要我们工人阶级“永远领导学校”，要我们把“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”的历史彻底颠倒过来，这是毛主席交给我们的伟大的历史使命，我们决不辜负毛主席的期望，一定把这个重担挑好！
    无产阶级的学校，就是应该由无产阶级来领导，无产阶级革命事业的接班人，只能依靠无产阶级自己来培养。关系到国家命运和前途的教育领导大权，我们不管谁管？！难道还让资产阶级老爷们管吗？不！绝对不能！
    我们工人阶级不但要管工厂、管机器，还要管学校、管教育，还要管全国、全世界，我们工人阶级就是要管一切！
    复旦大学学生、红卫兵小将王世清说：我们是劳动人民出身的子弟，抱着学知识为社会主义建设事业服务的决心，跨进了学校的大门。可是十几年来，在学校听到、看到、学到的东西，使我非常失望。在学校里，找不到真正的老师，学不到真正有用的知识。指导我们学习的是资产阶级“权威老爷”，学习的是封、资、修的那一套腐朽没落的破烂。今天工人阶级跨进了复旦的大门，我心中非常激动。毛主席派来了工人阶级，冲开了被资产阶级统治的高等学府的深宅大院，庄严宣告工人阶级应该领导学校，而且要永远领导学校！从此，我们真正的老师永远进了学校。过去我们做的是资产阶级“权威老爷”的学生，今后我们要老老实实地一辈子做工人阶级的小学生。
      工人阶级一定能管好大学
    上海市活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子、驻复旦大学工人毛泽东思想宣传队副团长郭三珍说：大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。有了毛泽东思想，我们就有了一切。我们工人阶级最忠于毛主席，心最红，眼最亮。有毛主席给我们撑腰，有毛泽东思想给我们引路，我们什么也不怕，什么事情也难不倒我们！
    当然，我知道，我们进大学后，会遇到困难，会有曲折，会有斗争。但是，只要我们坚决按照毛主席指示办事，坚决依靠革命的红卫兵小将和革命师生员工，在解放军战士的支持与帮助下，我们一定能管好大学，一定能搞好教育革命。
    驻复旦大学工人毛泽东思想宣传队第四连连长袁春华说：有人胡说什么“工人没有知识，不懂教育，管不了大学”。我说，不！大学有什么了不起！拥有九百多万平方公里土地和七亿人口的中国，我们工人阶级都管得了，几个大学有什么管不了的！
    在伟大领袖毛主席的领导下，中国工人阶级和亿万劳动人民赶跑了霸占我国的外国侵略者，推翻了蒋家王朝的统治，建立了新中国；在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们又摧毁了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，粉碎了他们复辟资本主义的迷梦。实践证明，真正不行的不是工人阶级，而是那些好摆臭架子的资产阶级知识分子。
    毛主席教导说：“最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”事实就是这样。我们工厂就有这样六个工人，他们都没有进过什么大学；可是，他们凭着一颗无限忠于毛主席的红心，在一无图纸、二无资料、三无样机的情况下，制造了生产上迫切需要的划线机。当这部划线机投入生产的时候，从外面跑来两名赫赫有名的所谓“权威”工程师。他们“依胡芦画瓢”，照着工人制造的划线机绘制成图，但是回去后却一直造不出划线机来。你看！两个称为“权威”的工程师，原来是两个大草包和大饭桶！那些不相信工人能管好大学的人，咱们走着瞧吧！
    空军驻复旦大学军训团战士何佩真说：工人阶级心最红，眼最亮，最仇恨一切反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的反革命言行，最痛恨为剥削阶级服务的旧教育制度，最反对某些知识分子破坏国家财产、阻碍斗、批、改的“打内战”行动，最讨厌言行不一的空谈习气和两面派作风。学校大权掌握在工人阶级手里，就能保证毛主席的最新指示迅速落实，就能保证大学永远是无产阶级的天下。
      毛泽东思想是我们的指路明灯
    上海市活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子、驻复旦大学工人毛泽东思想宣传队副团长郭三珍说：我们今天跨进了学校，掌握了领导大权。我们靠什么来领导，靠什么来完成斗、批、改的历史使命呢？最根本的就是靠毛泽东思想。我们工人毛泽东思想宣传队到复旦后，就是要大力宣传毛泽东思想，突出毛泽东思想，一定不能忘记狠抓两个根本。第一要狠抓毛泽东思想的学习，首先要抓好自己的学习，只有学好了，才能宣传好。我们工人阶级千带头、万带头，首先要带好学习毛泽东思想的头。对毛主席的每一个最新指示都要逐条逐句地认真学习，迅速贯彻落实，坚决反对“嘴上呱呱叫，行动不对号”的资产阶级恶劣学风。第二要狠抓阶级斗争不转向。毛主席教导我们：“阶级斗争，一抓就灵。”抓不抓阶级斗争，是工人阶级能不能长期占领学校的关键。我们要狠狠打击混进学校的一小撮叛徒、特务、反革命分子、死不悔改的走资派和反动的资产阶级学术“权威”，以及没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，要批判形形色色的资产阶级思想和作风。只有这样，工人阶级在学校才能永远扎下根，永远领导好学校。我们还要警惕资产阶级糖衣炮弹的进攻，不断提高我们的政治觉悟和思想水平。只要我们牢记毛主席的教导，永远不忘工人阶级的本色，就一定能够在大学里站得住，立得稳，就一定能够完成毛主席交给我们的光荣任务。
        解放军誓做工人的坚强后盾
    空军驻复旦大学军训团战士郑朝阳说：工人宣传队进驻大学是伟大的创举，它标志着资产阶级知识分子统治学校的时代永远结束了，无产阶级自己掌握教育大权的时代开始了。复旦大学过去是中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人把持的重点学校，阶级斗争一直很尖锐，很复杂。现在，工人阶级掌握了学校大权，这是一场大变革，是一个大革命。“人民大众开心之日，就是反革命分子难受之时。”阶级敌人是不会甘心失败的，他们一定会千方百计地进行破坏、捣乱。因此，今后的阶级斗争会更加深刻、更加复杂。我们中国人民解放军是无产阶级专政的强大柱石。毛主席热爱我热爱，毛主席支持我支持。在工人毛泽东思想宣传队长期留在学校，永远领导学校的过程中，我们要坚决站在工人阶级一边，坚决支持工人毛泽东思想宣传队的一切革命行动，誓做他们的坚强后盾。我们要在实现教育革命的伟大战斗中，和工人阶级团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起，不夺取文化大革命的全面胜利，决不收兵！　（据新华社上海三十日电）
