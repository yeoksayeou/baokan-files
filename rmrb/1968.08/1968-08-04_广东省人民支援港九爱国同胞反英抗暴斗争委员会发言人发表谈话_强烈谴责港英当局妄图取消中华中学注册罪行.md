The spokesperson of the Guangdong Province Committee for Supporting Hong Kong and Kowloon Compatriots in Anti-British Struggle issued a statement today, strongly condemning the British authorities in Hong Kong for attempting to deregister the Chinese Middle School as a new form of persecution against the patriotic educational cause in Hong Kong. The spokesperson sternly warned the British authorities in Hong Kong: if they insist on their wrongdoings and further persecute the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, continuing to be enemies of the Chinese people, they must bear all the consequences that arise from this.

The spokesperson said, the British authorities in Hong Kong declared on July 19 that they had begun legal procedures to deregister the Chinese Middle School, attempting to use fabricated charges to deregister the school and suppress the patriotic educational cause in Hong Kong. This new persecution by the British authorities in Hong Kong immediately provoked strong indignation and protests from the entire faculty, staff, and students of the Chinese Middle School, as well as from patriotic compatriots in various sectors of Hong Kong and Kowloon. Relevant authorities in our country are closely monitoring the development of this incident.

The spokesperson pointed out that it is well known that the Chinese Middle School is a prestigious patriotic school in Hong Kong. Since last May, the British authorities in Hong Kong have repeatedly sent armed police to raid the school, beating and arresting its faculty, staff, and students. Subsequently, on November 28 last year, they used the excuse of an "explosion incident" in the Chinese Middle School to forcibly close the school premises; on December 2, they even kidnapped the school principal, Mr. Wong Cho-fan, and detained him in a concentration camp. Now, the British authorities in Hong Kong have audaciously declared their intention to deregister the Chinese Middle School. This fully exposes their so-called "protection of student safety" and "maintenance of public interests" as mere cover-ups for their deliberate attempts to suppress the Chinese Middle School and persecute our patriotic educational cause. The spokesperson pointed out that the so-called "reasons" put forward by the British authorities in Hong Kong are completely fabricated and misleading.

The spokesperson of the Guangdong Province Committee for Supporting Hong Kong expressed that our great leader Chairman Mao taught us: "'Lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet,' this is a Chinese proverb describing the behavior of some fools. The reactionaries of all countries are exactly such a bunch of fools. The various persecutions they inflict on the revolutionary people ultimately only serve to promote broader and more intense revolutionary struggles by the people." The faculty, staff, and students of the Chinese Middle School, having suffered persecution from the British authorities in Hong Kong and being greatly indignant at the British authorities' savage suppression of our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, have risen up to resist and joined the heroic struggle against British oppression. Their actions are just and beyond reproach. We firmly support the three stern demands presented by the Chinese Middle School to the British authorities in Hong Kong, which are:

1. Immediately revoke the "closure order" against the Chinese Middle School;
2. Immediately stop the plot to "deregister the Chinese Middle School";
3. Immediately release the principal of the Chinese Middle School, Mr. Wong Cho-fan, and other patriotic faculty, staff, and students still imprisoned in the school, and guarantee their personal safety.

The spokesperson pointed out that the British government repeatedly claims to "hope to ease Sino-British relations," and the British authorities in Hong Kong also repeatedly declare their intention to maintain Hong Kong's "prosperity and stability." In reality, however, the British authorities in Hong Kong have been continuously taking actions that seriously damage Sino-British relations and create tension in Hong Kong. For example, they have blatantly refused to distribute 1,000 sets of winter clothing donated by the Red Cross Society of Guangdong Province to our patriotic compatriots who have been unjustly detained, without the slightest regard for basic humanitarian principles; they have delayed and obstructed the issue of 5,000 tons of consolation rice donated by our society to be transported into Hong Kong, resulting in this batch of rice still not being able to enter Hong Kong and be distributed to patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong; they have obstructed and sabotaged the resumption of work by patriotic workers in Hong Kong from various angles; they have suppressed the activities of our patriotic compatriots in promoting Mao Zedong Thought, and so on. Now, the British authorities in Hong Kong are preparing to take the serious step of "deregistering" the Chinese Middle School. We ask, is the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong prepared to push the situation in Hong Kong to a new level of tension? The British authorities in Hong Kong must understand that the Chinese people and patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, are not to be trifled with. Our patriotic teachers and students in Hong Kong and Kowloon will not be intimidated by your "closure order," and our patriotic educational cause will not be harmed in the slightest by your attempt to "deregister the Chinese Middle School." The spokesperson finally sternly warned the British authorities in Hong Kong: if you insist on your wrongdoings and further persecute the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, continuing to be enemies of the Chinese people, then all the consequences that arise from this must be borne by the British authorities in Hong Kong.

　　广东省人民支援港九爱国同胞反英抗暴斗争委员会发言人发表谈话
　　强烈谴责港英当局妄图取消中华中学注册罪行
    严正警告：港英当局如果一意孤行，变本加厉迫害港九爱国同胞，继续与中国人民为敌，必须承担由此引起的一切后果
    新华社广州三日电　广东省人民支援港九爱国同胞反英抗暴斗争委员会发言人今天发表谈话，强烈谴责香港英国当局妄图取消香港中华中学注册借以打击香港爱国教育事业的新的迫害行为，坚决支持港九爱国同胞的正义斗争。发言人严正警告香港英国当局：港英当局如果一意孤行，继续与中国人民为敌，那么由此而引起的一切后果，必须由香港英国当局承担。
    发言人说，香港英国当局于七月十九日悍然宣称“已开始进行取消中华中学注册之法律手续”，妄图以莫须有的罪名，取消香港中华中学的注册，借以扼杀这所爱国学校，打击香港的爱国教育事业。香港英国当局这一新的迫害行为，立即引起中华中学全体师生员工和港九各界爱国同胞的极大愤慨和强烈抗议。我国有关方面也正在密切注视着这一事件的发展。
    该发言人指出，众所周知，香港中华中学是香港一所卓有社会声望的爱国学校。去年五月以来，香港英国当局多次派遣武装军警搜劫中华中学，殴打、拘捕这所学校的师生员工，接着在去年十一月二十八日，就以“中华中学内发生爆炸事件”为借口，强行封闭中华中学校舍；十二月二日，竟又绑架这所学校的校长黄祖芬先生，把他强行扣押在集中营内。现在，香港英国当局竟悍然宣称准备取消中华中学的注册。这就彻底地暴露了它所说的什么“保护学生安全”、“维护公众利益”等等，只不过是用来掩盖它蓄意扼杀中华中学、迫害我爱国教育事业的遮羞布。发言人指出，香港英国当局所举出的所谓“理由”，完全是颠倒黑白、混淆视听的一派胡言。
    广东省支港委员会发言人表示，我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。他们对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”中华中学的爱国师生员工，身受港英当局的迫害，并且激于对香港英国当局镇压我港九爱国同胞的野蛮暴行的极大愤慨，奋起反抗，投入了英勇的反英抗暴斗争，他们的行动是正义的，是无可非议的。我们坚决支持中华中学代表向香港英国当局所提出的三项严正要求，即：
    一，立即撤销对中华中学的“封闭令”；
    二，立即停止“取消中华中学注册”的阴谋；
    三，立即释放中华中学校长黄祖芬先生及这所学校其他仍被监禁在狱中的爱国师生，并保证他们的人身安全。
    发言人指出，英国政府口口声声说什么“希望缓和中英关系”，香港英国当局也一再声称要保持香港的“繁荣和安定”，但实际上，香港英国当局却在连续不断地采取严重损害中英关系、制造香港紧张局势的做法。例如，它曾毫不顾及起码的人道原则，悍然拒绝将我广东省红十字会捐赠的一千套寒衣，分发给被无理拘禁的我爱国同胞；对我会捐赠的五千吨慰问大米运进香港的问题进行拖延刁难，致使这一批大米至今未能运进香港，分发给香港爱国同胞；对香港爱国工人的复工行动，又多方阻挠破坏；对我爱国同胞宣传毛泽东思想的活动，进行镇压，等等。现在，香港英国当局又准备对中华中学采取“取消注册”这一严重步骤，试问，英国政府和香港英国当局是否准备把香港局势再度推向新的紧张？香港英国当局必须懂得，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民和港九爱国同胞是不好惹的，我港九爱国师生绝不是你们一纸“封闭令”所能吓倒的，我们的爱国教育事业也绝不会因为你们妄图“取消中华中学注册”而受到丝毫损害。发言人最后严正警告香港英国当局：你们如果要一意孤行，变本加厉地迫害港九爱国同胞，继续与中国人民为敌，那么由此而引起的一切后果，必须由香港英国当局承担。
