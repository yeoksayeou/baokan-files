	Closely Unite Around the Proletarian Headquarters
	National Model Worker in Agriculture, Vice Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Revolutionary Committee Rao Xingli

	On the joyous occasion of celebrating the second anniversary of the publication of the great leader Chairman Mao's big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters" and the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China Concerning the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," a great piece of news came from Beijing. Our great leader Chairman Mao presented a precious gift of mangoes to the workers and peasants Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams in the capital. We, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, are all deeply moved and feel infinitely happy. This is not only the greatest concern, trust, and support from Chairman Mao for the workers and peasants Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams in the capital, but also the greatest encouragement, concern, education, and spur for the revolutionary people throughout the country, for us broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. We, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, together with the workers and soldiers of the entire country, enthusiastically acclaim: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!

	Our great leader Chairman Mao is heart to heart with us, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. For decades, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Hubei Province have followed Chairman Mao in making revolution and have achieved one great victory after another. More than forty years ago, Chairman Mao held a peasant movement training class in Wuhan, leading us poor and lower-middle peasants to fight against the local tyrants, distribute land, stage armed uprisings, and establish rural revolutionary bases. Under Chairman Mao's wise leadership, millions of workers and peasants soldiers, closely relying on the broad masses of the people, drove out Japanese imperialism, overthrew the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and liberated the whole of China.

	After leading us, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, out of the feudal exploitative system that devours people, Chairman Mao again led us to make revolution continuously. Over the past decade, our province's vast rural areas have rapidly achieved collectivization and the establishment of people's communes, embarking on the broad road to socialism. In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in the entire province, together with hundreds of millions of revolutionary people throughout the country, followed Chairman Mao closely. Under the command of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, we launched a fierce attack on the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev. After repeated struggles, we thoroughly smashed China's Khrushchev and his agent in Hubei, Wang Renzhong's, dream of restoring capitalism in Hubei. We seized back the part of the power over party, government, finance, and culture that they had usurped, achieving a decisive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Now, in our province, the vast majority of counties, nearly 80% of districts, and more than 90% of communes have established revolutionary committees. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants are following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment to seize an all-round victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	Chairman Mao, in his old age, understands our poor and lower-middle peasants' revolutionary demands the best, believes in us the most, and leads us poor and lower-middle peasants to achieve continuous victories in the stormy waves of class struggle! We, the poor and lower-middle peasants, love Chairman Mao the most and are the most loyal to Chairman Mao. Whatever Chairman Mao says, we do it, step by step, and carry it out resolutely. We strongly oppose those who shout support with their mouths but do something else in their actions, those verbal revolutionaries. From our own revolutionary practice, we deeply understand that the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin is the sole leadership center for the entire party, army, and country. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants will achieve victory as long as they follow Chairman Mao closely and unite tightly around this leadership center, with unified will, unified steps, and unified actions, achieving victory.

	The bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev represents the interests of the Kuomintang reactionaries, that is, the bourgeoisie and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, plotting to restore capitalism, suppress the broad masses of the people, and attempt to make us poor and lower-middle peasants become the slaves of imperialism, the bourgeoisie, and the landlord class again, walk back the old road, and suffer twice. We, the poor and lower-middle peasants, will never agree to this. Through the tempering of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in our province have greatly heightened their awareness of the struggle between the two lines, focusing all their hatred on the handful of capitalist roaders within the party and their agents, the counter-revolutionary revisionists like Wang Renzhong, and becoming more loving, more loyal, and more steadfast in following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. A handful of class enemies, unwilling to accept defeat, are still struggling desperately. They use the so-called "multi-center theory" to spread rumors, slander, and stir up trouble, attempting to sabotage the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin and disrupt Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. We, the poor and lower-middle peasants, actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Chairman Mao's series of extremely important latest instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have clearer minds and brighter eyes, and wield the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought to timely expose the tricks of a handful of class enemies, determined to criticize and expose the reactionary "multi-center theory."

	Those who emphasize "me as the center" put the interests of their small cliques above the interests of the party and the people. Such people shout support for Chairman Mao with their mouths but actually follow their small cliques and small units. Such people have short-sighted views, cannot see the big picture of the revolution, and their heads are swollen with bourgeois factionalism and individualism. If they do not seriously reform their worldview, actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, especially work hard on their words, and touch their souls deeply, they will deviate from the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers and walk onto the dangerous road of opposing the proletarian headquarters. Although such people are only a handful, if we do not seriously criticize them, it will disrupt the unity of the revolutionary ranks on the principles of Mao Zedong Thought, obstruct the thorough implementation of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, disrupt Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and allow a handful of class enemies to carry out their tricks. Therefore, the "multi-center theory" is a harmful element and must be seriously criticized and thoroughly eliminated.

	In the future, we will resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's revolutionary line under the command of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, with unified will, unified steps, and unified actions. We will swiftly and well implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, achieving new victories in the struggle to seize an all-round victory in the Cultural Revolution.

　　紧密地团结在无产阶级司令部的周围
　　全国农业劳动模范、湖北省革命委员会副主任　饶兴礼
    在全国亿万人民热烈欢庆伟大领袖毛主席《炮打司令部》的大字报和《中国共产党中央委员会关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》发表两周年的大喜日子里，北京传来特大喜讯，我们的伟大领袖毛主席，向首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队赠送了珍贵礼物芒果。我们广大贫下中农无不感到万分激动，感到无限幸福。这不仅是毛主席对首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队的最大关怀、最大信任、最大支持，也是对全国革命人民，对我们广大贫下中农的最大鼓舞、最大关怀、最大教育、最大鞭策。我们广大贫下中农，和全国工人阶级、解放军战士一道，最热烈地欢呼：毛主席万岁！毛主席万岁！
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席和我们广大贫下中农心连心。几十年来，我们湖北省的广大贫下中农，紧跟毛主席闹革命，夺取了一个又一个的伟大胜利。四十多年前，毛主席就在武汉举办农民运动学习班，领导我们贫下中农打土豪，分田地，武装起义，建立农村红色根据地。在毛主席的英明领导下，千百万工农子弟兵，紧紧依靠广大人民群众，赶走了日本帝国主义，推翻了蒋家王朝的统治，解放了全中国。
    毛主席领导我们广大贫下中农从吃人的封建剥削制度下解放出来后，又带领我们贫下中农不断闹革命。十几年来，我省广大农村迅速地实现了合作化、人民公社化，走上了社会主义的康庄大道。在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们全省广大贫下中农和全国亿万革命人民一起，紧跟毛主席，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的统帅下，向以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部发动了猛烈的进攻。经过反复较量，彻底粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在湖北的代理人王任重妄图在湖北复辟资本主义的美梦，夺回了他们篡夺的那部分党、政、财、文大权，取得了无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利。现在，我省绝大多数县，将近百分之八十的区和百分之九十以上的公社，已经成立了革命委员会。广大贫下中农紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，正在夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    毛主席他老人家，最了解我们贫下中农的革命要求，最相信我们贫下中农，领导我们贫下中农在阶级斗争的大风大浪中不断胜利前进！我们贫下中农最热爱毛主席，最忠于毛主席，毛主席说什么，我们就做什么，步步紧跟，坚决照办。我们最反对那种口里喊拥护而行动上另是一套的口头革命派。我们从自己的革命实践中深深懂得，以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，是全党、全军、全国唯一的领导中心，广大贫下中农，只要紧跟毛主席就是胜利，只要紧紧地团结在这个领导中心的周围，统一意志，统一步伐，统一行动，就是胜利。
    以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，代表国民党反动派即资产阶级和地、富、反、坏、右分子的利益，阴谋复辟资本主义，镇压广大人民群众，妄图使我们贫下中农再做帝国主义、资产阶级、地主阶级的牛马，走回头路，吃二遍苦，我们贫下中农坚决不答应。经过无产阶级文化大革命的锻炼，我省广大贫下中农极大地提高了两条路线斗争的觉悟，把千仇万恨集中在党内最大的一小撮走资派及其代理人、反革命修正主义分子王任重之流的身上，对以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，更加热爱，更加忠诚，更加坚定不移地紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。一小撮阶级敌人不甘心失败，还在垂死挣扎，他们利用什么“多中心论”，造谣污蔑，挑拨离间，妄图破坏以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，干扰毛主席的伟大战略部署。我们贫下中农活学活用毛泽东思想，学好用好毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的一系列极其重要的最新指示，心更明，眼更亮，奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，及时识破了一小撮阶级敌人的这一阴谋诡计，决心批臭反动的“多中心论”。
    强调“以我为中心”的人，把自己的小团体的利益摆在党和人民利益之上。这种人口头上喊紧跟毛主席，实际上紧跟的是小团体、小单位。这种人眼光太短浅，看不到革命的大局，资产阶级山头主义和个人主义使他们的头脑膨胀。他们如果不认真地改造世界观，活学活用毛泽东思想，特别是在用字上狠下功夫，狠触灵魂，任其发展下去，就会脱离广大工农兵群众，走到对抗无产阶级司令部的危险道路上去。这种人虽然只是极少数，但是如果不对他们进行严肃的批评，就会破坏革命队伍在毛泽东思想原则上的团结，阻挠毛主席革命路线的彻底贯彻，干扰毛主席的伟大战略部署，使一小撮阶级敌人得以施展其阴谋诡计。因此，“多中心论”是害群之马，必须严肃批判，坚决肃清。
    今后，我们决心在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的号令下，统一意志，统一步伐，统一行动，坚决执行毛主席的革命路线，又快又好地落实毛主席的最新指示，在夺取文化大革命全面胜利的战斗中立新功。
