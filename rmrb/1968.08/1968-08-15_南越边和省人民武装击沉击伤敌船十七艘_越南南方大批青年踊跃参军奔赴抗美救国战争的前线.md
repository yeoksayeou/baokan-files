People's Armed Forces in Binh Dinh Province Sink and Damage 17 Enemy Ships

According to a report from the Liberation Radio of South Vietnam, the People's Liberation Armed Forces in Binh Dinh Province of South Vietnam attacked enemy ships on the Ong Bo, Dong Truong, and Long Do rivers on July 30, 31, and August 5, sinking, damaging, and burning 17 enemy ships and annihilating a large number of American aggressors.

On the morning of August 5, the artillery of the People's Liberation Armed Forces attacked a convoy of enemy troop transport ships on the Ong Bo River. The shells hit five large troop transport ships, one of which was sunk, and almost all the American aggressors on board were killed or wounded.

At the same time, the People's Liberation Armed Forces intercepted a convoy on the Dong Truong River. One enemy ship was hit, caught fire, and exploded, killing or wounding all the enemy command personnel on board, including a U.S. military officer. The People's Liberation Armed Forces pressed their advantage, and the remaining four enemy ships that were in disarray and fleeing were also hit and set on fire.

Earlier, on July 30, the People's Liberation Armed Forces set fire to an 8,000-ton cargo ship on the Long Do River, about 25 kilometers southeast of Saigon, and damaged a 12,000-ton cargo ship. Both ships were carrying enemy military equipment.

The next day, a convoy of eight river ships transporting enemy troops on the Ong Bo River was again intercepted by the People's Liberation Armed Forces. Five enemy ships were hit and set on fire, with heavy casualties among the enemy troops. The remaining enemy ships quickly turned around and fled, forcing the planned "sweep" to be interrupted.

Large Numbers of Youth in South Vietnam Enlist to Join the Anti-American Resistance War

According to a report from the Liberation Radio of South Vietnam, in the first half of this year, large numbers of youth in South Vietnam have enthusiastically joined the People's Liberation Armed Forces and rushed to the front lines of the anti-American resistance war.

According to incomplete statistics, by the end of May, about 100,000 youth in the Central and Southern regions, where the fighting is intense, have signed up to join the army. Other regions also have tens of thousands of youth who have signed up. In the liberated areas of the Central, Southern West, and Southern East regions, almost all the youth in the villages have signed up.

Among the youth who have signed up to join the army, there are many young workers. In the half month from May 4 to 20, more than 200 young workers from the Ong Kieu and Kieu Cong rubber plantations joined the army to fight the enemy. In addition, large numbers of ethnic minority youth have also actively signed up to join the army. In the first five months of this year, the number of people who joined the army in Gia Lai Province, where ethnic minorities are concentrated, was five times the total number of people who joined the army in the previous year with the highest number of recruits. The Khmer people in provinces such as Kinh Mon have also actively sent their children to join the people's army. Many young people living in enemy-occupied cities and "strategic hamlets" have broken through enemy blockades to join the liberation army in the liberated areas.

Some newly enlisted youth have performed outstanding feats in battle and have been named "Heroes in the Battle Against the Americans."

According to a report from the Liberation Radio of South Vietnam, from July 22 to 26, the military and people of Quang Nam Province in South Vietnam launched continuous attacks on more than 70 enemy bases and facilities in cities such as Da Nang, Hoi An, Tam Ky, and other places. According to incomplete statistics, they killed, wounded, and captured more than 1,400 enemy personnel (including more than 650 American aggressors and South Korean mercenaries), shot down and destroyed 41 enemy aircraft (those destroyed at Da Nang and Chu Lai airfields are not included in the count), destroyed 53 military vehicles, and demolished numerous cannons, warehouses, bunkers, barracks, and bridges. A large number of weapons, ammunition, and military supplies were also seized.

　　南越边和省人民武装击沉击伤敌船十七艘
　　越南南方大批青年踊跃参军奔赴抗美救国战争的前线
    新华社河内十三日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方边和省人民解放武装力量七月三十日、三十一日和八月五日的三天中，在翁胶、东争和龙都河上猛袭敌人，共击沉击伤和烧毁敌船十七艘，并且歼灭了大批美国侵略军。
    八月五日上午十点，人民解放武装力量炮兵在翁胶运河上袭击装载敌军的河船运输队。炮弹击中了五艘大型军用运输船，其中一艘被击沉，船上的美国侵略军几乎都被打死打伤。
    与此同时，人民解放武装力量还截击了东争河上的一支船队。其中一艘敌船被击中起火爆炸，船上的全部敌军指挥人员，其中包括一名美军将级军官都被打死打伤。人民解放武装力量乘胜追击，狼狈逃窜的其余四艘敌船也被击中起火。
    在此之前，七月三十日，人民解放武装力量在距西贡东南大约二十五公里的龙都河上，放火烧了一艘八千吨的货船，并且打坏了一艘一万二千吨的货船，这两艘货船都载有敌人的军事装备。
    第二天，一支由八艘河船组成的运送敌军的船队在翁胶河上又遭到了人民解放武装力量的截击。其中有五艘敌船中弹起火，船上的敌军死伤累累。其余的敌船赶忙调转船头逃窜，不得不中断了预定的“扫荡”。
    新华社河内十三日电　今年上半年，越南南方又有大批青年踊跃参加人民解放武装力量，奔赴抗美救国战争的前线。
    据不完全统计，在战斗激烈的中部中区和南部中区，截至五月底，各有约十万名青年报名参军。其他地区，也都有上万或数万名青年报了名。中部中区、南部西区和南部东区解放区的乡村青年，几乎都报了名。
    在报名参军的青年中，有不少是青年工人。翁桂、桂贡橡胶园在五月四日到二十日的半个月中，有二百多名青年工人参军杀敌。除此之外，大批少数民族青年也积极报名参军。少数民族聚居的嘉莱省，今年头五个月的参军人数，比过去参军最多的一年的总人数多五倍。金瓯等省的高棉族人民，也积极地把自己的子弟送进人民的部队。居住在敌占城市和“战略村”的许多青年，纷纷冲破敌人的封锁，到解放区参加了解放军的队伍。
    一些新参军的青年在战斗中立下了出色的战功，被评为“歼美勇士”。
    据新华社河内电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方广南省军民在七月二十二日到二十六日的五天中，接连向岘港、会安、三岐和其它许多城镇中的七十多个敌军基地和设施发动进攻，据不完全统计，共打死、打伤和俘虏敌人一千四百多名（其中包括美国侵略军和南朝鲜帮凶军六百五十多名），击落击毁敌机四十一架（在岘港和朱莱机场被击毁的没有计算在内），击毁军车五十三辆，摧毁大炮二十门和仓库、碉堡、营房与桥梁多座，缴获武器、弹药和军用物资一大批。
