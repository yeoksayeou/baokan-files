The American Black people have raised the revolutionary banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries" and have launched a new wave of struggle against violence. Starting from late July, the seventh-largest city in the United States, Cleveland, echoed with the sounds of Black people's armed resistance against violence. Subsequently, in Boston, Detroit, Seattle, Ely, Great Falls, Greenville, Cincinnati, and Peoria, Black people's struggles against violence erupted one after another. The wave upon wave of Black struggles across the United States has powerfully shaken the evil rule of U.S. monopoly capital.

We, the Red Guards of Chairman Mao, firmly support the revolutionary struggle of the American Black people. The American Black people's struggle is extensive and deep-going, and especially, the revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win of the broad masses of Black people greatly inspires us.

Our great teacher, Chairman Mao, has paid great attention to the revolutionary struggle of the American Black people. Chairman Mao's two brilliant statements supporting the just struggle of the American Black people issued on August 8, 1963, and April 16, 1968, are outstanding documents of Marxism-Leninism. They provide powerful theoretical and ideological weapons for the American Black people's struggle, shining a bright light on the path of the American Black people and all oppressed nations striving for liberation.

In the recent American Black people's struggle against violence, it can be seen that through continuous struggle practice, the level of the American Black people's struggle is increasingly rising. They have drawn extremely profound lessons from the assassination of Black pastor Martin Luther King Jr. They have further broken the spiritual shackles of "non-violence," courageously taken up arms, and used revolutionary violence to oppose counter-revolutionary violence, fiercely fighting back against white racists and the U.S. reactionary ruling clique.

The Black people of Cleveland took up arms and fought back against the fascist police who came to suppress them, leaving many dead and wounded. Facing the suppression of the military and police, Black youth declared with great power: "When we arm the people with guns, we will deal with you." This fearless spirit prominently shows the heightened consciousness of the American Black people.

As time passes and the struggle deepens, more and more Black people, including women and children, have joined the great tide of struggle against racial discrimination and for freedom and equal rights. Recently, a "survey report" published by the U.S. ruling clique admitted: "The vast majority of participants in the Black people's struggle are between the ages of 25 and 34," and "they are in fact representatives of Black society." The report also admitted that in Detroit, women accounted for more than 40 percent of the total number of participants in the Black people's struggle against violence. This widespread mass character is a sign of the powerful force of the current American Black people's struggle.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "National struggles, after all, are a class struggle issue." Chairman Mao also pointed out: "The contradiction between the broad masses of Black people in the United States and the U.S. ruling clique is a class contradiction." The system of racial discrimination in the United States has always been a form of class oppression. Fundamentally, national oppression is produced with the existence of classes and class oppression. To thoroughly eliminate the system of racial discrimination and national oppression, it is necessary to thoroughly eliminate class oppression, overthrow the reactionary rule of the monopoly capitalist clique, and overthrow the evil imperialist system. The American Black people's struggle against violence is essentially a life-and-death class struggle of the oppressed class against the oppressing class. The American Black people, by closely combining the struggle against racial discrimination with the American workers' movement and carrying out a protracted struggle, will surely achieve thorough liberation and final victory.

Chairman Mao said: "The central task and highest form of revolution is to seize political power through armed struggle, to solve problems through war. This Marxist-Leninist revolutionary principle is universally correct." The struggle for liberation of the American Black people and the American people will surely take this road.

Fight on, heroic American Black brothers! May the revolutionary flames in the heart of U.S. imperialism burn more fiercely! Your struggle for liberation is a component of the world revolution of our time. Seven hundred million Chinese people stand on your side! All revolutionary people of the world stand on your side! As Chairman Mao pointed out: "The evil system of colonialism and imperialism, which rose with the enslavement and trafficking of Black people, will surely come to an end with the thorough liberation of the Black race."

Down with U.S. imperialism!

The revolutionary struggle of the American Black people will surely win!

　　美国黑人抗暴斗争必胜
　　北京地质学院　红宣兵
    美国黑人高举“对反动派造反有理”的革命大旗，掀起了抗暴斗争的新浪潮。从七月下旬开始，美国第七大城市克利夫兰响起了黑人武装抗暴的枪声。接着，在波士顿、底特律、西雅图、伊利、大瀑布城、格里、辛辛那提和皮奥利亚等城市，相继爆发了黑人抗暴斗争。美国全国各地一浪接一浪的黑人斗争，有力地冲击着美国垄断资本的罪恶统治。
    我们，毛主席的红卫兵，坚决地支持美国黑人的革命斗争。美国黑人斗争广泛而深入地开展，特别是广大黑人敢于斗争、敢于胜利的革命精神，极大地鼓舞了我们。
    我们的伟大导师毛主席，十分关注美国黑人的革命斗争。毛主席在一九六三年八月八日和一九六八年四月十六日发表的支持美国黑人正义斗争的两个光辉声明，是马克思列宁主义的杰出文献，给美国黑人斗争提供了强大的理论武器和思想武器，象一盏光辉的明灯，把美国黑人和一切被压迫民族争取解放的道路照得通亮。
    在最近的美国黑人抗暴斗争中，可以看到，通过不断斗争的实践，美国黑人的斗争水平日益提高。他们从黑人牧师马丁·路德·金被暗杀一事得到了极其深刻的教训。他们进一步奋起砸烂“非暴力主义”的精神枷锁，勇敢地拿起武器，以革命的暴力反对反革命的暴力，大造白人种族主义者的反，大造美国反动统治集团的反。
    克利夫兰市黑人拿起武器，把赶来镇压的法西斯警察打得死伤累累。黑人青年面对军警的镇压，有力地宣告：“等我们用枪支把人民武装起来，我们就要收拾你们。”这种大无畏的气概，突出地表现了美国黑人觉悟的提高。
    随着时间的推移和斗争的深入，越来越多的黑人，甚至妇女和儿童，投入了反对种族歧视、争取自由和平等权利的伟大斗争洪流。最近，美国统治集团发表的一个“调查报告”承认：参加黑人斗争的“绝大多数人年龄在二十五岁到三十四岁之间”，“他们事实上是黑人社会的代表”。这个“报告”还承认在底特律参加黑人抗暴斗争的总人数中，妇女占百分之四十以上。这种广泛的群众性，是当前美国黑人斗争威力强大的一个标志。
    毛主席指出：“民族斗争，说到底，是一个阶级斗争问题。”毛主席又指出：“美国广大黑人同美国统治集团之间的矛盾，是阶级矛盾。”美国的种族歧视制度从来就是阶级压迫的一种形式。从根本上说，民族压迫是随着阶级和阶级压迫的存在而产生的。要彻底消灭种族歧视制度、消灭民族压迫，就必须彻底消灭阶级压迫，推翻垄断资本集团的反动统治，推翻万恶的帝国主义制度。美国黑人的抗暴运动，实质上是一场被压迫阶级反对压迫阶级的你死我活的阶级斗争。美国黑人把反对种族歧视的斗争同美国工人运动紧密地结合起来，开展持久的斗争，就必然会取得彻底的解放和最后的胜利。
    毛主席说：“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。这个马克思列宁主义的革命原则是普遍地对的”。美国黑人和美国人民的解放斗争，也一定要走这一条道路。
    战斗吧，英雄的美国黑人兄弟！愿你们在美帝国主义的心脏里把革命的烈火燃得更旺，更旺！你们争取解放的斗争，是当代世界革命的一个组成部分。七亿中国人民站在你们一边！全世界革命人民站在你们一边！正如毛主席指出的：“万恶的殖民主义、帝国主义制度是随着奴役和贩卖黑人而兴盛起来的，它也必将随着黑色人种的彻底解放而告终。”
    美帝国主义必败！
    美国黑人的革命斗争必胜！
