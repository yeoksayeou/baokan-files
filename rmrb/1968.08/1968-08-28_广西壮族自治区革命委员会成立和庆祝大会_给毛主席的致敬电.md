Today, the revolutionary people of all ethnic groups in Guangxi, who are fighting on the frontline of supporting Vietnam and resisting America, are filled with revolutionary fervor. We report to you, our most beloved and red sun, a piece of heartening news: the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee has been born in victory under the radiant sunlight of your latest instructions, amidst the stormy winds of class struggle!

From the shores of the Beibu Gulf to the banks of the Youjiang River, the east wind is sweeping; from the mountains of northern Guangxi to the Friendship Pass, red flags are flying. Countless smiling faces turn towards the red sun, and countless red hearts fly to your side. The heroic sons and daughters of all ethnic groups in Guangxi, who are infinitely loyal to you, joyfully shout and sing:

Hail the great victory of your brilliant thoughts and revolutionary line!
Sing of the brilliant achievements of your latest instructions in southern China!
Hail the great achievements of the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work led by the People's Liberation Army, which you personally created and led!
Thousands of cheers, tens of thousands of songs, most sincerely wishing you, Chairman Mao, eternal life! Eternal life!

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! At this joyous moment of celebrating the birth of the Revolutionary Committee, countless unforgettable memories surge in our hearts. Recall the revolutionary journey of the people of Guangxi, not a single step was not guided by your revolutionary line. Look at the red flags dancing on both banks of the Yong River today, not a single one does not shine with the brilliant light of your thoughts!

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! We will never forget that in the dark days of "long nights and unclear skies," it was you who personally founded the Guangzhou Peasant Movement Training Institute, which cultivated the revolutionary sparks for Guangxi and ignited the flames of revolutionary armed struggle on the banks of the Zuo and You Rivers. Under the guidance of your brilliant thought of "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun," revolutionary red flags flew everywhere!

We will never forget that in the years of blazing revolutionary flames, it was you who commanded the "hundreds of thousands of heroes crossing the Yangtze River," directly attacking the stronghold of the Guizhou warlords, and planting the five-star red flag all over southern China. Since then, the people of Guangxi have been liberated, and the laboring people have their homes.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! We will never forget that in the unforgettable year of 1958, you personally visited Guangxi and presided over the historic "Nanning Conference" of great significance. You personally wrote the highest instructions on running the Guangxi Daily, which gave us great encouragement and boundless strength. Your magnificent spirit of winter travel on the Yong River will forever inspire us to hold high the red flag of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, and to forge ahead bravely in the storms of class struggle, inspiring us to fight against heaven and earth, and strive for strength.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! To ensure that our red mountain of the proletariat remains unchanged for thousands of generations, you, with your great vision and wisdom, personally initiated and led this great proletarian cultural revolution that shook the world, opening a new era in the international communist movement. Under your command of "Bombard the Headquarters," "millions of workers and peasants leapt up," and the Red Guards took the lead, holding high the revolutionary banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against the reactionaries," and launched a fierce attack on the headquarters of the bourgeoisie led by the Chinese Khrushchev, defeating them completely. Under your leadership, we formed a vast revolutionary army and fought bravely, repelling the ferocious attacks of the bourgeois reactionary line, exposing the traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalists, counter-revolutionaries, and untransformed landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in Guangxi, and seizing back the power of the party, government, finance, and culture that they had usurped into the hands of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Through countless life-and-death tests and arduous struggles, we have come to understand a great truth: loyalty to you is victory.

At the crucial moment of the decisive battle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, it was you who issued the great call for the People's Liberation Army to support the broad masses of the left. The People's Liberation Army stood firmly on your proletarian revolutionary line, resolutely supporting the broad masses of the left, and becoming a strong backing for the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, making great contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They achieved brilliant victories in the battles against the invading American bandits, bravely defending the national defense and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and strongly supporting the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against America.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Your revolutionary line has dyed the vast land red; your brilliant thoughts have illuminated the hearts of the revolutionary people; your series of latest instructions are the great guidelines for our actions; the important documents personally approved by you, such as the Central Committee's "Decision on the Guangxi Issue," are the battle course for achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Guangxi! At a time when a handful of class enemies were spreading the evil wind of rightist capitulation, you personally approved the issuance of the important battle command of the Proletarian Headquarters to solve the problems of the cultural revolution in Guangxi and the country, and we closely followed your great strategic deployment, launching a more fierce attack on those wolves who attempted to restore capitalism, and achieving great victories.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee has been born in victory, but "the road after the revolution is longer, the work is greater and more arduous." We will not disappoint your expectations of us. We solemnly pledge to you:

"Navigating the vast sea relies on the helmsman, making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought."

Respected Chairman Mao, we have only one resolution: to firmly carry out and thoroughly implement your great instructions! We will definitely follow your great strategic deployment step by step! We will definitely hold high the great red flag of your brilliant thoughts, under the leadership of the Proletarian Headquarters headed by you and Vice Chairman Lin, unite closely, unify our understanding, unify our steps, and unify our actions. Remember your great teaching of "never forget class struggle," closely follow your great strategic deployment, continue to deeply and persistently carry out the revolutionary criticism, resolutely oppose rightist opportunism, rightist splittism, and rightist capitulationism, thoroughly smash the evil wind of rightist revisionism, thoroughly criticize and expose the handful of top capitalist roaders and their agents in Guangxi such as He Ximing and Xie Wangang, and thoroughly criticize and expose the traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist roaders, counter-revolutionaries, and untransformed landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!

Respected Chairman Mao! We will definitely take Vice Chairman Lin as a shining example, seriously study and apply your brilliant thoughts, comprehensively implement your series of latest instructions, take "criticize selfishness and revise revisionism" as the key, establish and run various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois "self," and establish the proletarian "public," resolutely overcome bourgeois factionalism, enhance proletarian party spirit, seriously reform our worldview. Resolutely criticize rightist opportunism and the reactionary thought of "left" in form but right in essence, criticize individualism, mountainism, small groupism, sectarianism, and anarchism, criticize the reactionary bourgeois "multi-center theory." Further consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary three-in-one combination according to the system, industry, and class, do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of our units, and make Guangxi a red Mao Zedong Thought school.

Respected Chairman Mao! You taught us: "The revolutionary committee is good." We will definitely cherish and support the newly born revolutionary committee, thoroughly smash the evil plots of the class enemies to shake and overthrow the revolutionary committee. We will definitely hold power well and use power well with your brilliant thoughts.

Respected Chairman Mao! We will definitely remember your teaching: "Seven hundred million Chinese people are the strong backing of the Vietnamese people, and the vast territory of China is the reliable rear base of the Vietnamese people." With a heart for the motherland and an eye for the world, carry forward the spirit of patriotism and internationalism, and on a larger scale, carry out the enthusiastic "support the army and love the people" movement, "grasp the revolution and promote production, work, and preparedness," and carry on the struggle against imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism represented by the Soviet revisionist clique to the end!

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! You are the great teacher of the proletariat. We will forever and ever be loyal to you! Forever and ever loyal to your brilliant thoughts! Forever and ever loyal to your revolutionary line! We vow to defend you, vow to defend the Proletarian Headquarters headed by you and Vice Chairman Lin, and vow to defend the great red flag of the Central Cultural Revolution that holds high your brilliant thoughts!

Most respected Chairman Mao, our great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman, the reddest sun in our hearts, we sincerely wish you eternal life a thousand times, ten thousand times! Eternal life! Eternal life! Eternal life!

      千声欢呼，万曲歌唱，最最衷心地敬祝您老人家万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
      毛主席啊，毛主席！在这纵情欢呼革命委员会诞生的幸福时刻，多少难忘的回忆，如同浪潮涌心头。忆往昔广西人民革命的航程，哪一程不是您的革命路线指引，看今日邕江两岸飞舞的红旗，哪一面不闪耀着您光辉思想的万丈光芒！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！我们永远记得，在那“长夜难明赤县天”的黑暗年代，是您，亲手创办的广州农民运动讲习所，为广西培育了革命火种，点燃了左江、右江两岸革命武装斗争的烽火。在您“枪杆子里面出政权”的光辉思想指引下，革命红旗到处迎风招展！
      我们永远记得，在那燎原烈火红满天的战斗岁月，是您，指挥“百万雄师过大江”，直捣桂系军阀老巢，把五星红旗插遍了祖国南方。从此，广西人民得解放，劳动人民把家当。
      毛主席啊，毛主席！我们永远记得，在那难忘的一九五八年，您老人家亲临广西，主持召开了具有伟大历史意义的“南宁会议”。您亲笔写下关于办好《广西日报》的最高指示，给了我们巨大的鼓舞和无穷的力量。您冬游邕江的豪迈气魄，永远鼓舞我们高举党的社会主义建设总路线、大跃进、人民公社的革命红旗，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中奋勇前进，激励我们战天斗地，奋发图强。

      毛主席啊，毛主席！多少次出生入死的考验，多少回艰苦卓绝的斗争，使我们体会到一个伟大的真理：忠于您就是胜利。
      在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线决战的关键时刻，是您，发出了“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号召。中国人民解放军旗帜鲜明地站在您的无产阶级革命路线上，坚决支持左派广大群众，做无产阶级革命派的坚强后盾，为无产阶级文化大革命作出了巨大的贡献。他们在打击入侵的美国飞贼的战斗中，取得了一个又一个的辉煌战绩，英勇地保卫了国防，保卫了无产阶级文化大革命，有力地支援了越南人民的抗美救国战争。
      毛主席啊，毛主席！您的革命路线，把万里山河染红；您的光辉思想，把革命人民的心照亮；您的一系列最新指示，是我们行动的伟大纲领；您亲手批示的中央《关于广西问题的决定》等重要文件，是夺取广西无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的战斗航向！在一小撮阶级敌人大刮右倾翻案妖风的时候，您老人家又亲自批准发布了无产阶级司令部关于解决广西和全国文化大革命问题的重要战斗号令，我们紧跟您的伟大战略部署，向那些妄想复辟资本主义的豺狼，发动了更加猛烈的进攻，取得了伟大的胜利。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！广西壮族自治区革命委员会胜利诞生了，“但革命以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦。”我们决不辜负您老人家对我们的期望，我们向您老人家庄严宣誓：
      “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”
    敬爱的毛主席，我们只有一个决心：对您的伟大指示，坚决照办，彻底执行！对您的伟大战略部署，我们一定步步紧跟！我们一定高举您的光辉思想的伟大红旗，在以您为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部领导下，紧密团结起来，统一认识，统一步伐，统一行动，牢记您“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，紧跟您的伟大战略部署，继续深入持久地开展革命大批判，坚决反对右倾机会主义，反对右倾分裂主义，反对右倾投降主义，彻底粉碎右倾翻案妖风，把党内一小撮最大的走资派及其在广西的代理人批深批透，斗倒斗臭，把一小撮叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派、反革命分子和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，统统挖出来，巩固和加强无产阶级专政，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
      敬爱的毛主席！我们一定以林副主席为光辉榜样，认真地活学活用您的光辉思想，全面落实您的一系列最新指示，以“斗私，批修”为纲，大办、办好各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，大破资产阶级“私”字，大立无产阶级“公”字，坚决克服资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，认真改造世界观。坚决批判右倾机会主义和形
  “左”实右的反动思想，批判个人主义、山头主义、小团体主义、宗派主义和无政府主义，批判反动的资产阶级的“多中心论”。进一步巩固和发展按照系统、按照行业、按照班级的革命大联合和革命三结合，搞好本单位的斗、批、改，把广西办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    敬爱的毛主席！您教导我们：“革命委员会好”。我们一定爱护、支持新生的革命委员会，彻底粉碎阶级敌人动摇和颠覆革命委员会的罪恶阴谋。我们一定用您的光辉思想掌好权、用好权。
    敬爱的毛主席！我们一定牢记您的教导：“七亿中国人民是越南人民的坚强后盾，辽阔的中国领土是越南人民的可靠后方。”胸怀祖国，放眼世界，发扬爱国主义和国际主义精神，更大规模地开展热烈的“拥军爱民”运动，“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”，把反对以美国为首的帝国主义和反对以苏修叛徒集团为代表的现代修正主义的斗争进行到底！
      毛主席啊，毛主席！您是无产阶级的伟大导师，我们永远永远忠于您！永远永远忠于您的光辉思想！永远永远忠于您的革命路线！誓死保卫您，誓死保卫以您为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，誓死保卫高举您的光辉思想的伟大红旗的中央文革！
