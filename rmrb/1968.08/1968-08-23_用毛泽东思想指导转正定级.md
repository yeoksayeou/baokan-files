Recently, sixteen apprentice workers in the Huiyang Automobile Maintenance Workshop in Guangdong Province reached the time for regularization and leveling. Regularization and leveling is an annual task, but it is often not done well. This time, the regularization and leveling work was the first after the establishment of the revolutionary committee. How should this work be done well? At that time, some workers told the workshop's revolutionary committee chairman and military representative, Qu Zuofa, "You are a military representative, just say who should be regularized and who should not be regularized." Some committee members also wanted to use the old methods, with a few people deciding everything behind closed doors.

Facing this situation, what should be done? Qu Zuofa thought: the more the masses trust us, the more we should trust the masses. Regularization and leveling is the masses' affair, and it should be discussed thoroughly by the masses first, not just decided by the leadership. Therefore, he encouraged the revolutionary committee members to change the old methods and go to the masses to listen to their opinions.

They went deep into the workshops, teams, and worked alongside the workers, discussing with them, and held a meeting with old, middle-aged, and young workers. The masses are the true heroes, and they have the best solutions. During the meeting, everyone proposed two suggestions: first, in the past, the regularization and leveling work did not emphasize proletarian politics. This time, in the regularization and leveling work, we must strongly criticize the reactionary fallacy of "technology first" spread by the Chinese Khrushchev, and correct the wrong idea of workers focusing on technology while neglecting the emphasis on proletarian politics; second, we must learn from the "Three Articles" and break private interests and establish public interests. Based on the masses' suggestions, they organized a specialized Mao Zedong Thought study class. In the class, many old workers, based on their own experiences, criticized the reactionary fallacy of "technology first" by the Chinese Khrushchev. Old worker Luo Rixiong angrily exposed the harm of the Chinese Khrushchev's "technology first" to him: in the past, he thought that with technology, he could go anywhere, so he worked day and night with a wrench by the machine, focusing on researching technology, rarely paying attention to politics, and not caring about state affairs, and did not study Mao Zedong's works seriously. Therefore, at the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he did not understand Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line very well and almost stood on the wrong side.

The old workers' lessons had a deep impact on the young workers. They took Comrade Zhang Tiede as an example, broke private interests and established public interests, and expressed their willingness to participate in the regularization and leveling with the proletarian "public" spirit. Based on the improved understanding, they adopted the method of self-reporting by individuals, evaluation by teams, and approval by the revolutionary committee, and regularized and leveled thirteen apprentice workers. The three apprentice workers who were not regularized and leveled this time were also in good spirits. They studied Mao Zedong's works more seriously and worked more actively than before. All the revolutionary workers in the workshop received a vivid Mao Zedong Thought education through this regularization and leveling, and the workers paid more attention to proletarian politics. The revolutionary criticism movement surged higher and higher, greatly promoting the development of production, and the production volume increased month by month.

    用毛泽东思想指导转正定级
    最近，广东省惠阳汽车保养场有十六名学徒工人到期转正定级了。转正定级这件事，年年搞，但往往搞不好。这次转正定级工作，是革命委员会成立以后的第一次，怎样搞好这件工作呢？当时有的工人对场革委会主任、军队代表屈祖发说：“你是军队代表，哪些人该定级，哪些人不该定级，你说说就行了。”个别委员也想采取过去的老办法，几个人关起门来，定一定就算完事。
    面对这种情况，应该怎么办？屈祖发心想：群众越是信任我们，我们越要信任群众。转正定级是群众的事，应该先让群众充分讨论，不能只是领导上说了算。于是他便启发革委会的同志改变过去老一套的作法，让革委会成员一起到群众中去，听听群众的意见。
    他们深入到车间、班组和工人一边劳动，一边交谈，并召开了有老工人、中年工人和青年工人参加的座谈会。群众是真正的英雄，他们最有办法。座谈中，大家提出了两条建议：一，过去在转正定级工作中，不突出无产阶级政治，这次在转正定级工作中，要狠批中国赫鲁晓夫散布的“技术第一”的反动谬论，纠正工人埋头钻研技术，而轻视突出无产阶级政治的错误思想；二，要学习“老三篇”，破私立公。根据群众的建议，他们办了一期专题毛泽东思想学习班。在学习班里，许多老工人以自己过去的切身体会，批判了中国赫鲁晓夫“技术第一”的反动谬论。老工人罗日雄愤怒地控诉了中国赫鲁晓夫“技术第一”对他的毒害：过去他认为有了技术就能走遍天下，因此白天黑夜拿着扳手在机器旁边专心致志地钻研技术，很少过问政治，不关心国家大事，毛主席著作学习也抓得不紧。所以在无产阶级文化大革命刚刚开始时，他对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线很不理解，差一点站错了队。
    老工人的这些教训对青年工人教育很深，他们以张思德同志为榜样，破私立公，表示要带着无产阶级的“公”字参加转正定级。在大家提高认识的基础上，采取个人自报，班组评议，革委会审批的方法，给十三名学徒工转正定了级。暂时没有转正定级的三名学徒工心情也很舒畅，他们学习毛主席著作比以前更认真，工作也比以前更积极了。全场革命职工通过这次转正定级，受到了一次生动的毛泽东思想教育，工人们更加突出无产阶级政治，革命大批判高潮一浪高过一浪，大大推动了生产的发展，生产量逐月上升。　惠支左
