For celebrating the fifth anniversary of the Congolese Revolution, the Congolese Charge d'Affaires Bakula held a reception in Beijing today.

Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Chen Yi, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo, Deputy Minister of Defense Si Yu, representatives of the Capital Workers and Peasants Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams, representatives of the Five Good Soldiers of the Beijing Garrison, and responsible members of various revolutionary mass organizations in Beijing were invited to attend the reception.

Charge d'Affaires Bakula and Vice Premier Chen Yi both spoke at the reception, expressing their wishes for the continuous strengthening and development of the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and the Congo (Brazzaville).

In his speech, Charge d'Affaires Bakula talked about the significance of the Congolese August Revolution, praising the fighting, fraternal friendship established between the Congo (Brazzaville) and China, and the strengthening of their common front in the uncompromising struggle against the international gendarmerie—the American imperialism. He also expressed his gratitude for China's increasing and expanding assistance to the Congo (Brazzaville) in various aspects.

Charge d'Affaires Bakula introduced the achievements made by the Congolese people in construction over the past five years, pointing out that the Congolese people with revolutionary traditions and the peoples of various countries fighting for national liberation are closely related. He said, the Congolese people condemn the inhuman aggression of the United States in Vietnam. The Congolese people support the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people. The Congolese people have always supported the struggle of the people of Cabinda, Angola, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, South Africa, and Guinea-Bissau for national liberation and against the minority white racists. The Congolese people condemn all those who use Israel to enslave the Arab people.

Speaking about the current international situation, Charge d'Affaires Bakula said, Chairman Mao Zedong calls for: "All the people of the world, unite! Defeat American aggression and its running dogs!" I sincerely believe that we should agree with the great fighter—Chairman Mao Zedong's opinion.

He said, the revolutionary forces of the world should not fold their arms and wait for the reactionaries to come and strangle them without any resistance. I think that the idea of folding one's arms and waiting for the reactionaries to come and strangle without any resistance is a very bad idea. However, all the devils in the world argue that this is for peaceful coexistence or peace, their purpose is to lull the peaceful, propertyless, long-exploited people into complacency, to erode their vigilance, so that they can more easily invade them.

Charge d'Affaires Bakula enthusiastically said, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by Chairman Mao Zedong has achieved tremendous victories. The Cultural Revolution will ensure that the capitalist restoration that once caused great suffering to the Chinese people will not occur in the People's Republic of China.

He said, all countries opposing international imperialism and fighting for national liberation, like the Congo, welcome the rapidly developing Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. These countries know that this revolution has great historical significance and that the Chinese people are preparing the conditions for the liberation of the world in terms of morality, spirit, and material. Therefore, I sincerely wish the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution greater victories.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said in his speech, over the past five years, the Congolese people have been fighting tirelessly to defend national independence and maintain state sovereignty against American-led imperialism, old and new colonialism, and their lackeys, achieving one victory after another. In international affairs, the Congo (Brazzaville) pursues a non-aligned foreign policy, opposes the aggressive and war policies of American imperialism, supports the just struggle of the Vietnamese people to resist American aggression and save their country, supports the just struggle of the Arab people, supports the struggle of the people of non-independent African countries for liberation, and opposes the policy of racial discrimination by imperialism in South Africa and South Rhodesia. The just stance and achievements of the Congolese people have won the praise and respect of the revolutionary peoples of Asia and Africa. The Chinese people are pleased and inspired by this. In the forward march of the Congolese people, the Chinese people will always stand with you.

Vice Premier Chen Yi pointed out that the current situation in Africa, like the anti-imperialist revolutionary situation in the world, is very good. However, American-led imperialism and their lackeys will not accept defeat in Africa, nor will they accept defeat in the Congo (Brazzaville). They will inevitably use various conspiracies and make desperate struggles. Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "Create disturbances, fail, create more disturbances, fail again, until they are wiped out—that is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in their dealings with the people's cause. They will not deviate from this logic." We believe that as long as the Congolese people and the African people strengthen their unity and persist in their struggle, it can be certain that the day when imperialism is completely driven out of the African continent is not far off.

Vice Premier Chen Yi thanked the African friends and Congolese friends for their praise and support of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He said, at present, our people across the country are following the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, closely uniting around the Proletarian Headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, unifying our thoughts, steps, and actions, and striving for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We believe that after the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought will quickly build our socialist motherland stronger and better support the revolutionary struggles of the oppressed peoples and nations of the world. Vice Premier Chen Yi emphasized that the seven hundred million people of China, after the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will have more strength to smash the joint anti-China activities of American imperialism and modern revisionism.

Vice Premier Chen Yi finally said, China and the Congo (Brazzaville) have established deep fighting friendship in the long-term struggle against imperialism and colonialism. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries, our friendly cooperative relations have been continuously developed on the basis of mutual respect, mutual support, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, and equality and mutual benefit. We are deeply convinced that in the future joint struggle against American-led imperialism and their lackeys, the fighting friendship between our two peoples and the friendly cooperative relations between our two countries will be further strengthened and developed.

Those who attended today's reception also included responsible comrades from various departments of the Chinese government, the People's Liberation Army, and the Beijing Revolutionary Committee.

Ambassadors from various countries to China were also invited to attend the reception.

On August 14, the China-Africa Friendship Association held a reception to enthusiastically celebrate the fifth anniversary of the Congolese Revolution.

Vice Chairman of the China-Africa Friendship Association Ding Xilin and Congolese Charge d'Affaires Bakula both spoke at the reception filled with friendly atmosphere, expressing their wishes for the continuous development of the friendship between the peoples of China and the Congo (Brazzaville).

Ding Xilin said, the continuous development of friendship between the peoples of China and the Congo (Brazzaville) is completely in line with the common wishes and interests of the peoples of the two countries. Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "The imperialists hope that we will not unite, not cooperate, not be friendly. We must use strengthening unity, strengthening friendly cooperation to respond to them, and we must make the imperialists' plots completely fail." In the future, the peoples of the two countries will march more closely hand in hand, support each other, and advance together in the struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism and in the construction of their own countries.

Ding Xilin said, the Chinese people, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, build socialist China stronger, and more powerfully support the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

Charge d'Affaires Bakula, in his speech, enthusiastically praised the new developments in the friendship between the peoples of the Congo (Brazzaville) and China, pointing out that the peoples of the two countries are both fighting against American imperialism and its lackeys. He said, we thank the Chinese people for providing the Congolese people with a large amount of selfless aid. We wish the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated by the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, even greater victories.

Diplomatic officials from the Congolese Embassy in China, responsible comrades from various relevant departments in China, including Ji Pengfei, Xie Huai, and Pan Zhenwu, as well as representatives from various revolutionary mass organizations in Beijing, attended the reception.

    巴库拉临时代办和陈毅副总理在庆祝刚果（布）革命五周年招待会上讲话
    共祝中国和刚果（布）人民战斗友谊不断发展
    周总理陈毅副总理和首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队代表等出席
    新华社十五日讯　为庆祝刚果（布）革命五周年，刚果（布）驻中国大使馆临时代办巴库拉，今天在北京举行招待会。
    国务院总理周恩来，副总理陈毅，人大常委会副委员长郭沫若，国防部副部长粟裕，首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队代表，驻京部队五好战士代表，北京市各革命群众组织的负责成员，应邀出席了招待会。
    巴库拉临时代办和陈毅副总理在招待会上先后讲话，他们共祝中国和刚果（布）两国人民的战斗友谊不断加强和发展。
    巴库拉临时代办在讲话中谈到了刚果（布）八月革命的意义，赞扬刚果
  （布）和中国建立了战斗的、兄弟般的友谊，并加强它们同国际宪兵——美帝国主义进行不妥协斗争的共同战线。他还感谢中国在各个方面不断给予刚果（布）以越来越多、越来越广泛的援助。
    临时代办介绍了刚果
  （布）人民五年以来在建设方面所取得的成就，指出具有革命传统的刚果人民和世界上争取民族解放的各国人民是休戚相关的。他说，刚果人民谴责美国在越南进行的灭绝人性的侵略战争。刚果人民支持兄弟的越南人民进行的英勇斗争。刚果人民一贯支持卡奔达、安哥拉、津巴布韦、莫三鼻给、南非、几内亚（比绍）人民争取民族解放、反对少数白人种族主义者的斗争。刚果人民谴责所有利用以色列来奴役阿拉伯人民的人。
    谈到当前国际形势时，巴库拉临时代办说，毛泽东主席呼吁：“全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗！”我诚恳地认为应该同意伟大的战士——毛泽东主席的意见。
    他说，世界革命力量不应该袖手等待反动派前来扼杀而毫无抵抗。我认为那种袖手等待反动派前来扼杀而毫无抵抗是一种很糟的观念。然而世界上一切魔鬼却诡辩说这是什么为了和平共处或和平，它们的目的就是为了麻痹那些和平的、一无所有的、长期被剥削的人民，销蚀他们的警惕性，以便更容易地对他们进行侵略。
    巴库拉临时代办热情地说，由毛泽东主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命取得了巨大的胜利。文化大革命将保证在中华人民共和国防止曾使中国人民蒙受极大苦难的资本主义进行复辟。
    他说，一切反对国际帝国主义、争取民族解放的国家，同刚果一样，欢呼迅猛发展的中国无产阶级文化大革命。这些国家知道这场大革命具有重大的历史意义，并且知道中国人民正在为全世界的解放从道义上、精神上和物质上准备条件。因此我热烈地祝愿无产阶级文化大革命取得更大的胜利。
    陈毅副总理在讲话中说，五年来，刚果（布）人民为了捍卫民族独立、维护国家主权，对美国为首的帝国主义、新老殖民主义以及它们的走狗进行了不懈的斗争，取得了一个又一个的胜利。在国际事务中，刚果（布）奉行不结盟的对外政策，反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，支持越南人民的抗美救国的正义斗争，支持阿拉伯人民的正义斗争，支持非洲未独立国家人民的解放斗争，反对帝国主义在南非、南罗的种族歧视政策。刚果（布）人民所采取的正义立场和取得的成就，赢得了亚非革命人民的称赞和尊敬。中国人民对此感到高兴和鼓舞。在刚果（布）人民前进的道路上，中国人民永远同你们站在一起。
    陈毅副总理指出，目前非洲形势同全世界反帝革命形势一样，一片大好。但是，以美国为首的帝国主义及其走狗是不会甘心在非洲的失败，也不会甘心在刚果（布）的失败的，它们必然要使用各种阴谋，作垂死的挣扎。中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席指出：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”我们相信，只要刚果（布）人民、非洲人民，加强团结，坚持斗争，可以肯定，帝国主义全部被赶出非洲大陆的日子已经为期不远了。
    陈毅副总理感谢非洲朋友和刚果（布）朋友们对我国无产阶级文化大革命的赞扬和支持。他说，目前我们全国人民，正遵循毛主席的伟大战略部署，紧紧地团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的周围，统一认识、统一步伐、统一行动，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利而奋斗。我们相信，经过无产阶级文化大革命，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，将会迅速地把我们的社会主义祖国建设得更加强大，将会更好地履行我们的国际主义义务，更好地支援世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族的革命斗争。陈毅副总理强调说，经过无产阶级文化大革命的七亿中国人民，会更有力量粉碎美帝国主义和现代修正主义所进行的联合反华的罪恶活动。
    陈毅副总理最后说，中国和刚果（布）两国人民在反帝反殖的长期斗争中建立了深厚的战斗友谊。两国建交以来，我们之间的友好合作关系，在互相尊重、互相支持、互不干涉内政、平等互利的基础上不断地得到发展。我们深信在今后反对以美国为首的帝国主义及其走狗的共同斗争中，我们两国人民的战斗友谊和两国的友好合作关系必将得到进一步的加强和发展。
    出席今天招待会的，还有我国政府各部门、中国人民解放军和北京市革命委员会等有关方面的负责人。
    各国驻中国使节也应邀出席了招待会。
    新华社十四日讯　中非友协今天举行招待会，热烈庆祝刚果（布）革命五周年。
    中非友协副会长丁西林和刚果（布）驻中国大使馆临时代办巴库拉，在充满友好气氛的招待会上先后讲话，共祝中国和刚果（布）两国人民的友谊日益发展。
    丁西林说，中国和刚果（布）两国人民友谊的不断发展，是完全符合两国人民的共同愿望和利益的。我们的伟大领袖毛主席说：“殖民主义者希望我们不团结，不合作，不友好。我们必须用加强团结、加强友好合作来回答它们，我们必须使殖民主义者的阴谋彻底破产。”今后，我们两国人民在反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争中，在建设各自国家的事业中，必将更加紧密地携手，互相支持，共同前进。
    丁西林说，经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的中国人民，将更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把社会主义的中国建设得更加强大，更有力地支持亚非拉人民的反帝革命斗争。
    巴库拉临时代办在讲话中热烈称颂刚果（布）和中国两国人民友谊的新发展，指出两国人民都是为反对美帝国主义及其走狗而进行斗争的。他说，我们感谢中国人民给予刚果（布）人民大量的无私的援助。我们祝中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席发动的无产阶级文化大革命取得更加伟大的胜利。
    刚果（布）驻中国大使馆外交官员，我国各有关方面的负责人姬鹏飞、谢怀德、潘振武，以及北京市各革命群众组织的代表，出席了招待会。
