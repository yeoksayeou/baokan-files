Guizhou Province has successfully developed a portable X-ray machine suitable for use by rural mobile medical teams. This new product is a result of Guizhou Province Medical Equipment Factory's implementation of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the workers of this factory launched a fierce criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line pushed by a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. The revolutionary workers declared that they would resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Following Chairman Mao's instruction to "shift the focus of medical and health work to rural areas," they sent out investigation teams to survey the medical equipment urgently needed in rural areas. They found that many mobile medical teams in rural areas lacked X-ray machines, which caused great difficulties for doctors in making diagnoses and inconvenienced the peasant masses. In many places, poor and lower-middle peasants had to walk dozens of miles to county hospitals equipped with X-ray machines for a single medical examination. The revolutionary workers of Guizhou Province Medical Equipment Factory, in response to this situation, decided to develop a small, lightweight, portable X-ray machine suitable for use by mobile medical teams going to the mountains and countryside.

　　贵州制成小型携带式爱克斯光机
    贵州省医疗器械厂充分发挥革命工人的创造智慧，试制成功一种适合农村巡回医疗队使用的小型携带式爱克斯光机。这种新产品是贵州省医疗器械厂贯彻执行毛主席革命路线的产物。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，这个厂革命职工狠狠批判了党内一小撮走资派推行的反革命修正主义路线。革命职工们表示，要坚决贯彻毛主席的革命路线。他们遵照毛主席“把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村去”的教导，派出调查组，调查农村迫切需要那些医疗器械。他们发现农村不少巡回医疗队由于没有爱克斯光机，给医生诊断带来很多困难，也给农民群众造成了许多不便。许多地方的贫下中农到有爱克斯光机的县医院检查一次身体，要走几十里路。贵州省医疗器械厂的革命职工针对这种情况，决定试制一种体积小、重量轻、适合农村巡回医疗队上山下乡使用的小型携带式爱克斯光机。
