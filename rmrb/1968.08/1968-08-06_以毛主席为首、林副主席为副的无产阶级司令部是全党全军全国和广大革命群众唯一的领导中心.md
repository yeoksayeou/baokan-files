The proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin is the sole leadership center for the entire Party, army, nation, and broad revolutionary masses. Chen Yonggui

Two years ago, Chairman Mao wrote the brilliant "Bombard the Headquarters" big-character poster at the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. Chairman Mao's big-character poster, with unparalleled power, exposed and smashed the bourgeois headquarters headed by the Chinese Khrushchev that had long been hidden within our Party. Today, at this critical moment in the struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, as we commemorate the publication of Chairman Mao's "Bombard the Headquarters" big-character poster, the hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses throughout the country have an even deeper love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao and to the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin.

"In sailing the seas, the helmsman is needed; in revolution, Mao Zedong Thought is needed." The proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin is the sole leadership center for the entire Party, army, nation, and broad revolutionary masses. It is precisely because we have the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin as our leadership center that, after more than two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a situation of unprecedented good fortune has emerged throughout the country and is getting better and better. Countless struggles have proven: the closer we follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, the more strictly we act according to the instructions of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, the more and greater our achievements will be. Take our Xiyang County as an example. It is precisely because the revolutionary masses and broad revolutionary masses of the entire county have listened to Chairman Mao's words and resolutely carried out the instructions of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao that, as early as April 1967, they achieved great unity on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought. Soon after, revolutionary committees at the county and commune levels were quickly established. After the establishment of the revolutionary committees, they actively responded to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production," carried out a thorough criticism of the revolution, directed the spearhead of the struggle against Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Shanxi and Xiyang, greatly raised the class consciousness and two-line struggle consciousness of the revolutionary masses, mobilized production enthusiasm, and further consolidated and developed the new revolutionary committees. In 1967, Xiyang County achieved an unprecedented harvest in agricultural production. Although this spring encountered severe drought, the yield of summer crops was still not lower than last year. Therefore, the broad revolutionary masses say: "Of all the important things, the most important is to carry out the instructions of the proletarian headquarters," "Of all the rules, the first rule is to listen to Chairman Mao's words."

The proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin is the sole leadership center because there cannot be any other center. My understanding is that Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Chairman Mao has brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, raising it to a new stage. Chairman Mao has discovered and mastered the laws of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. Chairman Mao's "Bombard the Headquarters" big-character poster, the "Sixteen Points" personally drafted by him, and a series of instructions have formulated a complete set of theories, lines, policies, and principles for continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, making the greatest contributions to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution.

Apart from a handful of class enemies, don't we all want to serve the people, represent the interests of the masses, and have a mass perspective? To unconditionally carry out the instructions of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin is the most complete and thorough service to the people, the true representation of the fundamental interests of the masses, and the strongest mass perspective. Don't we all want to be proletarian revolutionaries? We say that we are loyal to the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, have an unlimited love and faith in this leadership center, and only then can we be true proletarian revolutionaries.

"In the world, there is no love without reason, nor is there hatred without reason." A true proletarian revolutionary will certainly be consistent in his unlimited loyalty to the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. Whatever the proletarian headquarters instructs, we will resolutely carry it out, daring to climb mountains of knives and cross seas of fire; whatever the proletarian headquarters prohibits, we will definitely not do, not even a little. It can be said that whether a person or an organization is a true revolutionary or a false one, whether they represent the fundamental interests of the broad masses, can be clearly judged by looking at their attitude towards the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin and whether they truly carry out the instructions of this leadership center or not.

To be unconditionally loyal to the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, we must currently criticize the reactionary "multi-center theory." Some people often emphasize "me as the center," which is wrong. First, the entire Party, army, nation, and broad revolutionary masses can only have one leadership center—the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. If "me as the center," then one's own small group's interests will be placed above the interests of the Party and the people; if it develops further, it will lead to the wrong path of opposing the proletarian headquarters. Second, if each department and unit wants to "me as the center," then there will be many centers, and it will become a loose sand, with no leadership center and no overall interests of the proletarian revolution. Of course, under the correct leadership of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, the broad masses have been fully mobilized, and there are very few people who want to "me as the center." Anyone who tries to "me as the center" will not have a good outcome. However, if this reactionary theory of bourgeois factionalism and individualism is allowed to exist and develop, it will disrupt the unity of the revolutionary ranks in Mao Zedong Thought, obstruct the implementation of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and be utilized by a handful of class enemies. Therefore, the "multi-center theory" must be seriously criticized and not allowed to interfere with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments.

Now is the crucial moment for us to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The greater our victory, the better the situation, the more the class enemies will struggle desperately. With our unlimited loyalty to the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, we must seriously implement every instruction of Chairman Mao, which has even greater significance. What do a handful of class enemies oppose the most? They oppose the great Mao Zedong Thought the most. Because of the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought, even the most cunning enemies have no place to hide. What do the class enemies fear the most? They fear the most that Chairman Mao's instructions will become the actual actions of the broad masses and that the proletarian revolutionaries will unite on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought. Once the broad revolutionary masses grasp Mao Zedong Thought and, under the command of the proletarian headquarters, unite their will, steps, and actions, all open and covert, armed and unarmed enemies will be doomed. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support." Therefore, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely carry out every instruction of the proletarian headquarters. We must implement what we understand and also implement what we temporarily do not understand, deepening our understanding in the process of implementation. My personal experience is that every instruction of Chairman Mao has great practical and historical significance, with rich and profound content. When it is first published, we often find it difficult to deeply understand it. The important thing is to resolutely carry it out and deepen our understanding in the process of implementation. In fact, it is only in the process of implementation that we can gradually deepen our understanding. Take Chairman Mao's "Bombard the Headquarters" big-character poster, for example! When Chairman Mao's big-character poster was published, it gave great encouragement and strength to the revolutionary masses throughout the country. Since Chinese Khrushchev had personally directed his agents to politically persecute the Dazhai Brigade, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai have a particularly strong proletarian sentiment towards Chairman Mao's "Bombard the Headquarters" big-character poster, feeling very close to it, full of energy, and full of hatred towards Chinese Khrushchev. However, our deep understanding of Chairman Mao's big-character poster also went through a process. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's "Bombard the Headquarters" big-character poster, we launched a sustained and fierce attack on the bourgeois headquarters headed by Chinese Khrushchev and achieved one victory after another. Now, our understanding of the great significance and profound content of Chairman Mao's "Bombard the Headquarters" big-character poster is deeper than it was two years ago. This is how we deepened our understanding in the process of implementation.

Currently, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is developing deeply. We must carry out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism, thoroughly clean up the class ranks, complete the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and do a good job in all aspects of production. Some comrades say: The work will be more difficult in the future. Indeed, the tasks before us are very heavy. But is it difficult to do? No. The proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin continuously and timely issue a series of instructions to us. The question is whether we follow closely and carry them out. If we follow closely and carry them out everywhere, the work will be easy to do, and we will move from victory to victory; on the contrary, if we "me as the center" and do things our own way, or say nice things on the surface but do not carry them out behind the scenes, the work will definitely be difficult to do and will fail.

The Dazhai Brigade encountered an unusual hailstorm in late June this year, causing very serious damage to agricultural production. At that time, comrades visiting Dazhai estimated, based on general agricultural knowledge, that the autumn harvest would be reduced by seven or eight tenths, and only two or three tenths could be recovered. Some revolutionary comrades who had been to Dazhai were worried about us, while class enemies were secretly pleased. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, are not pessimistic or discouraged. They firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching: "The wealth of society is created by workers, peasants, and intellectuals. As long as these people take control of their own destiny and have a Marxist-Leninist line, they do not evade problems but solve them actively, any human difficulty can be overcome." We continue to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of hard work and self-reliance, using every means to fight against the disaster. The crops were beaten by hail, so we used seedlings from unaffected brother communes and brigades to fill in. When the seedlings were even, we weeded diligently and added more fertilizer. Now we have turned the severe disaster into a minor one. If we do not encounter another major disaster, we can still strive for a good harvest in the autumn. The class enemies' fantasy of Dazhai surrendering to natural disasters has been shattered again. Listening to Chairman Mao's words, bad things can be turned into good things. The anti-disaster struggle has once again tested and tempered the poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai. Especially, it has once again proven: Acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions, there is no difficulty that cannot be overcome.

We are determined to forever be loyal to the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and to resolutely carry out every instruction of Chairman Mao. We will learn and apply, speak and act, and achieve new victories in the struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

　　以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部是全党全军全国和广大革命群众唯一的领导中心
　　陈永贵
    两年以前，毛主席在党的八届十一中全会上写下了光辉的《炮打司令部》的大字报。毛主席的大字报，以无比的威力揭穿和粉碎了长期隐藏在我们党内的以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部。今天，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的关键时刻，纪念毛主席的《炮打司令部》大字报的发表，全国亿万革命群众对于伟大领袖毛主席，对于以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，更加无限热爱，无限忠诚。
      “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，是全党、全军、全国和广大革命群众唯一的领导中心。正是由于我们有以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部这个领导中心的英明领导，经过两年多的无产阶级文化大革命运动，全国各地普遍出现了从来没有过的大好形势，而且越来越好。千百次的斗争实践都证明：我们对毛主席的伟大战略部署跟得越紧，我们越是严格地按照毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的指示办事，取得的成绩就越多越大越好。拿我们昔阳县为例，正是由于全县无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众听毛主席的话，坚决执行毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的指示，早在一九六七年四月初，就在毛泽东思想的基础上实现了革命大联合。接着很快建立起县、社的革命委员会。在革命委员会成立以后，又积极响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，深入开展革命的大批判，把斗争矛头紧紧对准中国赫鲁晓夫和他在山西、在昔阳的代理人，大大提高了革命群众的阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟，调动了生产积极性，进一步巩固和发展了新生的革命委员会。一九六七年，昔阳县的农业生产获得了历史上从来没有过的大丰收。今年春季虽然遇到严重干旱，夏熟作物产量仍然不低于去年。因此，广大革命群众说：“千重要，万重要，执行无产阶级司令部的指示最重要”，“一千条，一万条，听毛主席的话是第一条。”
    以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，所以是唯一的领导中心，不能有什么第二个中心，我的体会是：因为毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。毛主席天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段。毛主席发现和掌握了无产阶级专政条件下继续革命的规律。毛主席写出《炮打司令部》的大字报、亲自主持制定的“十六条”和一系列指示，为无产阶级专政下继续革命制定出一整套理论、路线、方针和政策，为中国革命和世界革命作出了最伟大的贡献。
    除了一小撮阶级敌人外，我们大家不是都要为人民服务，要代表群众利益，要有群众观点吗？不折不扣地执行以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的指示，就是最完全、最彻底的为人民服务，就是真正代表群众的根本利益，就是最强的群众观点。我们大家不是都要做无产阶级革命派吗？我们说的做的都忠于以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，无限热爱、无限信仰这个领导中心，才能算是真正的无产阶级革命派。
      “世上决没有无缘无故的爱，也没有无缘无故的恨。”真正的无产阶级革命派，就一定会表里一致地无限忠于以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部。凡是无产阶级司令部指示的，就坚决照办，刀山敢上，火海敢闯；凡是无产阶级司令部禁止的，就一定不干，就一点不沾边。可以这样说，一个人，一个组织，是真革命还是假革命，是不是代表广大群众的根本利益，只要看看他们对待以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的态度怎么样，对这个领导中心的指示是真执行还是假执行，就可以清清楚楚地作出判断。
    要无限忠于以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，当前要批判反动的“多中心论”。有的人往往强调“以我为中心”，这是错误的。首先，我们全党、全军、全国和广大革命群众只能有一个领导中心——以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部。如果“以我为中心”，那就会把自己的小团体的利益，摆在党和人民的利益之上；发展下去，就会走到对抗无产阶级司令部的错误道路上去。其次，假设各个部门、各个单位都要“以我为中心”，那就会出现许多中心，那不就成了一盘散沙，还有什么领导中心，还有什么无产阶级革命的整体利益？当然，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的正确领导下，广大群众已经充分发动起来，要“以我为中心”的人是极少数，任何人要搞什么“以我为中心”，都是不会有好结果的。但是，这种资产阶级山头主义、个人主义的反动理论，如果任其存在和发展下去，就会破坏革命队伍在毛泽东思想上的团结，阻挠贯彻毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就会被一小撮阶级敌人利用。因此，对于“多中心论”，必须严肃批判，不许它干扰毛主席的伟大战略部署。
    现在正是我们夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的关键时刻。我们的胜利越大，形势越好，阶级敌人越要作垂死挣扎。我们怀着对以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的无限忠诚，认真贯彻执行毛主席的每一个指示，具有更为重要的意义。一小撮阶级敌人最反对什么？它们最反对伟大的毛泽东思想。因为有了光芒万丈的毛泽东思想，再狡猾的敌人也无藏身之地。阶级敌人最怕什么？它们最怕毛主席的指示变为广大群众的实际行动，最怕无产阶级革命派在毛泽东思想基础上团结起来。广大革命群众一旦掌握了毛泽东思想，在无产阶级司令部的号令下统一意志，统一步伐，统一行动，一切明的、暗的，拿枪的、不拿枪的敌人就统统完蛋。毛主席教导我们：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护”。因此，我们就是要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决执行无产阶级司令部的每一个指示。理解的要执行，暂时不理解的也要执行，在执行过程中加深理解。我个人的体会是：毛主席的每一个指示，都具有伟大的现实意义和历史意义，内容既丰富又深刻。乍一发表出来，我们往往很难深刻领会。重要的是坚决去执行，在执行中加深理解。事实上，也只有在执行中才能一步一步加深理解。就拿毛主席的《炮打司令部》的大字报来说吧！毛主席的大字报一发表，给了全国革命群众以很大的鼓舞和力量。由于中国赫鲁晓夫曾经亲自指挥他的代理人对大寨大队进行政治迫害，我们大寨的贫下中农对于毛主席《炮打司令部》的大字报有着特别强烈的无产阶级感情，读起来觉得非常亲切，浑身是劲，对中国赫鲁晓夫充满了仇恨。但是我们深刻理解毛主席的这张大字报，也是经过一个过程的。我们在毛主席《炮打司令部》的大字报的指引下，向以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部发起持续猛烈的进攻，取得了一个又一个胜利。现在我们对毛主席《炮打司令部》的大字报的伟大意义和深刻内容的理解，同两年前比较，就更进了一步。这就是我们在执行过程中加深了理解。
    当前，无产阶级文化大革命正深入发展。我们要深入持久地开展革命大批判，切实做好清理阶级队伍的工作，要完成斗、批、改的任务，要搞好各项生产。有的同志说：今后的工作更难做了。的确，摆在我们面前的任务是十分繁重的。但是，是不是难做呢？不对。以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，不断地及时地给我们发出一系列的指示。问题就看我们是否紧跟，是否照办。处处紧跟，坚决照办，工作就好做，就会从胜利走向胜利；相反，“以我为中心”，另搞一套，或是当面说得好听，背后又不执行，工作就必然不好做，必定失败。
    大寨大队今年六月下旬遭遇一场少见的冰雹，给农业生产带来十分严重的灾害。当时到大寨参观访问的同志按照一般农业常识估计，秋收要减少七、八成，只能收回二、三成。对于这场严重灾害，一些到过大寨的革命同志为我们担心，而阶级敌人却暗自高兴。经过无产阶级文化大革命烈火锻炼的大寨的广大贫下中农，不悲观，不泄气，牢记毛主席的教导：“社会的财富是工人、农民和劳动知识分子自己创造的。只要这些人掌握了自己的命运，又有一条马克思列宁主义的路线，不是回避问题，而是用积极的态度去解决问题，任何人间的困难总是可以解决的。”我们继续发扬艰苦奋斗，自力更生的革命精神，千方百计同灾害作斗争。庄稼苗被冰雹砸烂了，就用没受灾的兄弟社、队间出的苗补上。苗齐了，就勤锄草，多加肥。现在已经把重灾变成了轻灾。如果不再遇到特大灾害，秋季仍然可以争取一个好收成。阶级敌人要大寨在自然灾害面前屈服的幻想又破灭了。听毛主席的话，坏事可以变成好事。抗灾斗争再一次考验和锻炼了大寨的贫下中农。特别是再一次证明：按照毛主席的指示办事，就没有不可克服的困难。
    我们决心永远忠于毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决执行毛主席的每一个指示。对毛主席的指示，学了就用，说了就做，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利中立新功！
