Tanks and rocket launchers cannot intimidate a people ready to fight. Mexican students bravely continue the struggle. Three thousand students in Villa Hermosa demonstrate in support of the capital's students' struggle.

	BEIJING, Aug. 31 (Xinhua) -- MEXICO CITY -- Students in Mexico City continued to protest in the streets on August 30, denouncing the brutal suppression by reactionary military police and opposing the corrupt imperialist and capitalist system.

	The students of Mexico City, who had participated in the August 29 anti-American imperialism and anti-violent suppression demonstration, were not intimidated despite the brutal suppression by military police backed by tanks and rocket launchers that night and on the morning of August 30. These students, aged between 14 and 18, some defended barricades made from overturned cars, fighting back with stones and homemade Molotov cocktails; others occupied public buses on the streets, painting slogans against violent suppression; still others rushed in and out of alleys, engaging in combat with the military police sent to suppress them.

	When the news that reactionary military police had used rocket launchers to attack a middle school on the morning of August 30 spread to the university district, university students gathered in anger and wrote slogans on the walls of some university buildings: "There is only one way out: revolution"; "Our struggle is not just against the 'riot police' but against the imperialist and bourgeois system."

	The military police, frightened by the students' brave struggle, announced the indefinite closure of six middle schools and the National University to further suppress the students. They also sent troops to surround six middle schools and heavily guarded the U.S. Embassy. Fully armed military police frequently patrolled the streets. Reports indicate that Mexico City is under military control.

	The military police's brutal suppression of the capital's students is further fueling the outrage of students in other regions of Mexico. On August 30, three thousand students in Villa Hermosa, the capital of the northeastern state of Tabasco, held a fierce demonstration in support of the capital's students' struggle. They engaged in combat with the military police sent to suppress them.

　　坦克和火箭炮吓不倒敢于斗争的人民
　　墨西哥学生英勇坚持战斗
　　比利亚埃尔莫萨市三千学生示威声援首都学生的斗争
    新华社三十一日讯  墨西哥城消息：墨西哥首都学生三十日继续在街头示威，抗议反动军警的血腥镇压，反对腐朽的帝国主义和资本主义制度。
    墨西哥城的学生在二十九日晚举行的反对美国殖民主义、反对暴力镇压的示威，在当晚和三十日清晨遭到有坦克和火箭炮支援的军警的血腥镇压后，那些年仅十四岁到十八岁的大学预科学生和中学生，并没有被吓倒。他们有的坚守用翻倒了的汽车筑起的街垒，用石块和土制燃烧瓶回击军警的进攻；有的占据了街上的公共汽车，刷上反对暴力镇压的标语；有的在大街小巷冲进冲出，同前来镇压他们的军警展开搏斗。
    当反动军警在三十日晨竟然用火箭炮轰击一所中学的消息传到大学区以后，大学生群情激愤地集合起来，在大学区大楼的一些墙上刷上了标语：“只有一条出路：革命”；“我们的斗争不仅为了反对‘防暴队’，而且为了反对帝国主义和资产阶级的制度”。
    被学生们的英勇斗争精神吓坏了的军警当局，为了进一步压制学生，宣布不定期关闭六所中学和国立大学，并且派军队包围了六所中学，用重兵严密守卫美国大使馆。全副武装的军警还不时在街上巡逻。据报道，墨西哥城已处在军事控制之中。
    军警当局对首都学生的血腥镇压，正进一步激起墨西哥其他地区学生的公愤。墨西哥东北部塔瓦斯科州首府比利亚埃尔莫萨市的三千名学生，三十日举行激烈的示威，声援首都学生的斗争。他们同前来镇压的军警展开了搏斗。
