The sky is clear and blue, red flags are flying, and the five continents are adorned in red. The red sun illuminates the mountains and rivers, and the songs of victory echo far and wide.

"Remembering the tumultuous years of the past," and looking at today, "the world is turned upside down with great emotion." August 18, 1966, is an unforgettable day for us! Our great leader Chairman Mao, radiant and vigorous, dressed in military uniform, ascended the Tiananmen Gate to review the million-strong Red Guards. Chairman Mao will forever be in our hearts, and our red hearts will forever be with the red sun! Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Your radiance warms our hearts. You trust the people the most, understand the revolutionary aspirations of the people the most; you respect the pioneering spirit of the people the most, and support the revolutionary Red Guards the most. The call to "Bombard the Headquarters" resonates across the vast sky; the brilliance of the "Sixteen Points" illuminates the path to victory! To uproot the roots of revisionism and to create a new era for humanity, workers, peasants, and soldiers, and revolutionary Red Guards, hoisting the banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries," wield the heavy hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, ride the east wind, break through the giant waves, follow the commander Chairman Mao, and charge onto the battlefield of class struggle. The flames of the Cultural Revolution burn brighter and brighter; the surging waves of revolutionary criticism are unstoppable! We have exposed a handful of capitalist roaders within the party, swept away their clique; destroyed the headquarters of the bourgeoisie, and shattered their dream of restoring capitalism!

The surging tide of revolutionary unity is overwhelming; the red flowers of the revolutionary three-in-one combination bloom everywhere. In the torrent of class struggle, the red successors grow vigorously! The great Red Guard movement, surging like a storm, has washed away all the filth and written a magnificent heroic epic!

A great innovation is shaking the world; a glorious voyage is filled with a million rays of light. Our great leader Chairman Mao says: "The nation's intellectual youth and student youth must definitely combine with the broad masses of workers and peasants." The Red Guards listen to Chairman Mao's words with great enthusiasm and determination. Intellectual youth go to the countryside and the factories, insisting on the fundamental direction of combining with workers and peasants, which is an important path to achieving ideological revolutionization, and it is Chairman Mao's greatest hope for revolutionary youth; it is a reliable guarantee for preventing and guarding against revisionism. The youth of the Mao Zedong era are like the sun at eight or nine in the morning, full of vigor and vitality, holding the revolutionary classics, rushing to where the country needs them the most! Down to the countryside, into the factories, to the grassroots, to the borderlands, walking the path of combining with workers and peasants, Chairman Mao's teachings are engraved in our hearts. Through the storms of class struggle, seeing the realities of class struggle, learning the skills of class struggle, and braving the waves of class struggle. We denounce the theory of "reading books to become officials" and bury the revisionist educational line thoroughly! We temper our boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, letting the revolutionary youth shine forever!

* * *

"Navigating the seas relies on the helmsman, making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought!" Revolutionary youth, red pioneers: Fight on, holding high the classics, with red hearts for the party! March forward, heads held high, riding the wind and breaking the waves! Let us unite closely under the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, following the course charted by Chairman Mao, with unified understanding, red hearts, and strong will; unified action, strong as steel; unified steps, surging forward! Resolutely smash the reactionary theory of "multiple centers," and swear to sweep away all class enemies! Seize the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution, and let the brilliance of the red sun illuminate the whole world!
