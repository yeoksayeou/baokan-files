	Italian sailors of the four major shipping companies under the "Industrial Revival Company" have decided to go on a large-scale strike to protest the authorities' rejection of their reasonable demands for improved working and living conditions. The strike by the sailors will cause twelve large passenger ships and many other ships of Italy to stop sailing for forty-eight hours each in Italian and foreign ports from the 21st to the 27th.

	The sailors of these four shipping companies have already staged a twenty-four-hour strike in various ports from August 7th to 15th to protest against the capitalists' increased working hours and worsening working conditions. Due to the company authorities' delaying tactics and refusal to accept their demands, the Italian sailors have resumed and intensified their strike actions.

    反对资本家的残酷剥削
    意大利海员举行大罢工
    新华社讯　罗马消息：意大利“工业复兴公司”所属四大航运公司的海员们决定举行大罢工，抗议当局拒绝海员提出的改善工作和生活条件的合理要求。海员罢工将使意大利十二艘大型客轮和许多轮船从二十一日到二十七日在意大利和外国港口分别停航四十八小时。
    这四家航运公司的海员们为了抗议资本家增加工作时间和恶化工作条件，从八月七日到十五日已先后在各港口举行了二十四小时罢工。由于公司当局采取拖延手段，不接受他们的要求，意大利海员们恢复并加强了他们的罢工斗争。
