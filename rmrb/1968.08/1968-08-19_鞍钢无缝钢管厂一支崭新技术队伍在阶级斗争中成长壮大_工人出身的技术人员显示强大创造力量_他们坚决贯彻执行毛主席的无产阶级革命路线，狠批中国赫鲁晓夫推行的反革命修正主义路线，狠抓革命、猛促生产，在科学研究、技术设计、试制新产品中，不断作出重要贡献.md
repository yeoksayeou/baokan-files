A new technical team at Anshan Steel's Seamless Pipe Plant has grown and strengthened through class struggle. Technicians of worker origin have shown tremendous creative power. They resolutely implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, fiercely criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev, and vigorously grasp revolution and production. In scientific research, technical design, and the trial production of new products, they have made significant contributions.

	New China News Agency, Shenyang: In the struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads, the revolutionary technical team of workers and engineers at Anshan Steel's Seamless Pipe Plant has shown immense creative power during the Cultural Revolution. After the establishment of the new revolutionary committee, with the help of the PLA's leftist support team, this team has fully played its vanguard role, grasped revolution, and promoted production. In scientific research, technical design, and the trial production of new products, they have made significant contributions.

	Anshan Steel's Seamless Pipe Plant is a modern factory with complete and advanced equipment. Before the Cultural Revolution, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Anshan, along with the capitalists within the factory, strongly opposed Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They promoted a counter-revolutionary revisionist line for managing enterprises, advocating "technology first," "money first," and "experts in charge," and obstructed the promotion of technicians from among the workers. They ridiculed and dismissed workers' suggestions and innovation demands. Despite these obstacles, technicians of worker origin broke through all barriers, daring to think, dare to venture, and dare to act. In the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation, they repeatedly demonstrated their boundless wisdom and talent, creating miracle after miracle for the socialist construction of our motherland. Especially during the Cultural Revolution, they always put proletarian politics first, grasped class struggle, and became pioneers in grasping revolution and models in promoting production.

	Ten years ago, the state urgently needed a batch of high-grade alloy pipes with world-leading technology. However, due to the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Anshan, along with a handful of capitalists within the factory, they did not believe in the masses and did not rely on the masses. They relied only on a few so-called technical "authorities" to coldly and quietly conduct trials behind closed doors, failing to produce any results after ten years. The unprecedented Cultural Revolution further ignited the revolutionary spirit and creative abilities of the broad revolutionary masses. The technical backbone team, with workers as the main force, fiercely criticized the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line of "experts in charge," broke superstitions, discarded crutches, and removed the bourgeois technical "authorities" from their positions. Relying on their own equipment and technical strength, they only took a short time to trial-produce these advanced alloy pipes. Under the efforts of this technical backbone team with workers as the main force, most of the foreign equipment in the entire factory has been reformed. Many ultra-large, ultra-small, ultra-thick, and ultra-thin cutting-edge products have been mass-produced, with production exceeding the original plan by one fold. Some special alloy steel pipes have significantly increased compared to before the Cultural Revolution, and many new varieties have far surpassed the world's advanced level. In the two years of the Cultural Revolution, the number of new products expanded production is equivalent to the total of the ten years before the Cultural Revolution, with the variety and specifications increasing from 3,700 items to 5,600 items.

	The revolutionary committee of the Seamless Pipe Plant, with the enthusiastic help of the PLA's leftist support team, pays special attention to establishing a technical team composed of technicians of worker origin and fully utilizing their revolutionary enthusiasm and pioneering spirit. To further improve the proletarian awareness and two-line struggle awareness of this team, they have held three sessions of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with old workers, worker technicians, and some student-origin technicians participating. They have deeply and persistently carried out revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line and scientific research line promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, eliminating the poison of counter-revolutionary revisionism, and thoroughly exposing the exploitative class ideology of "those who labor with their brains rule over those who labor with their hands." They have established Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, ensuring that the technical leadership of the factory is firmly in the hands of the proletarian revolutionaries. Now, many worker engineers and technicians in this factory have taken up leadership positions in scientific research. One engineer of worker origin and six old workers have been elected into the revolutionary committee, holding the power to manage socialist enterprises.

	According to the past design specifications, the 140 machine set in the hot-rolling workshop requires a major overhaul every two years. During each major overhaul, regardless of the actual production and equipment situation, production was halted for a month. After the establishment of the revolutionary committee, worker technicians, engineers, and workers with practical experience held a symposium, conducted on-site investigations, and under the leadership of the revolutionary committee, organized all participants in the overhaul according to Chairman Mao's teaching of "holding study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes." They transformed the overhaul site into a battlefield for revolutionary criticism and a large classroom for linking theory with practice. With boundless love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, the broad revolutionary masses fiercely criticized the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents' counter-revolutionary revisionist lines of "experts in charge" and "technology first." They fully mobilized the masses, and as a result, completed the equipment overhaul in just five days.

	In the class struggle and production struggle, the factory revolutionary committee also attaches great importance to worker-origin technicians and knowledge-origin technicians working together to carry out "one helps one" and "one pair of reds" activities. They often organize knowledge-origin technicians to go to the workshops and work alongside workers, jointly grasp revolution, study, and help knowledge-origin technicians strive to follow the path of integrating with workers and peasants, the path of linking theory with practice, and promote their ideological revolutionization. They establish the ideology of wholeheartedly serving the people and lay a good ideological foundation for building a new technical team armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

    鞍钢无缝钢管厂一支崭新技术队伍在阶级斗争中成长壮大
    工人出身的技术人员显示强大创造力量
    他们坚决贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫推行的反革命修正主义路线，狠抓革命、猛促生产，在科学研究、技术设计、试制新产品中，不断作出重要贡献
    新华社沈阳电　在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争中成长壮大起来的鞍山钢铁公司无缝钢管厂工人工程技术队伍，在文化大革命中显示出无比强大的创造力量。新生的革命委员会成立以后，在驻厂解放军支左人员帮助下，这支队伍充分发挥先锋作用，狠抓革命，猛促生产，在科学研究、技术设计、试制新产品中，不断作出重要贡献。
    鞍钢无缝钢管厂，是一个设备全、技术新的现代化工厂。无产阶级文化大革命以前，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在鞍钢的代理人和厂内走资派，极力对抗毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，极力推行反革命修正主义办企业路线，大搞“技术第一”、“金钱挂帅”、“专家治厂”，百般阻挠从工人中提拔技术人员。对工人的建议和革新要求，看笑话，吹冷风。尽管如此，工人出身的工程技术人员，仍然冲破层层阻力，敢想，敢闯，敢干，在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动中，不断显示出无比的智慧和才能，为祖国社会主义建设事业创造一个又一个奇迹。尤其是在无产阶级文化大革命中，他们始终突出无产阶级政治，狠抓阶级斗争，成了抓革命的闯将，促生产的模范。
    十年前国家就急需一批具有世界先进水平的高级合金管，但由于中国赫鲁晓夫及其在鞍钢代理人和厂内一小撮走资派，不相信群众，不依靠群众，只靠几个所谓技术“权威”冷冷清清地关门试制，搞了十年也没有搞成。史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命进一步激发了广大革命职工的革命精神和创造能力，以工人为主体的技术骨干队伍，狠狠批判了中国赫鲁晓夫“专家治厂”的反革命修正主义路线，破除迷信，甩掉洋拐棍，把资产阶级技术“权威”赶下了台，依靠自己的设备和技术力量，只用了很短时间就试制出这些具有先进水平的合金管。在这支以工人为主力军的技术骨干队伍的努力下，全厂大部分洋设备都进行了改革，许多特大、特小、特厚、特薄的尖端产品大批生产出来，产量超过原计划的一倍。一些特别合金钢管比文化大革命以前有大幅度增长，许多新品种远远超过世界先进水平。在文化大革命的两年里，扩大生产的新产品，相当于文化大革命以前十年的总和，品种规格由三千七百项增加到五千六百项。
    无缝钢管厂革委会，在驻厂解放军支左人员热情帮助下，对建立一支由工人出身的技术人员组成的工程技术队伍，并充分发挥他们的革命积极性和首创精神特别重视。为了进一步提高这支队伍的无产阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟，先后举办了三期有老工人、工人技术员和部分学生出身的技术人员参加的毛泽东思想学习班，深入持久地开展革命大批判，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人所推行的反革命修正主义路线和科研路线，肃清反革命修正主义流毒，搞臭“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”的剥削阶级观念，大立毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，使工厂技术领导权牢牢掌握在无产阶级革命派手中。现在，这个厂的许多工人工程技术人员走上了科学研究领导岗位，有一名工人出身的工程师和六名老工人还被选进革委会，掌握了管理社会主义企业的大权。
    按过去设计书上规定，热轧车间一四○机组全套设备两年一大修，历次大修时，不管生产和设备实际情况，一律停工一个月。革委会成立以后，工人技术员和工程师和有实践经验的工人一起开座谈会，进行现场调查研究，并在革委会的领导下，按毛主席“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的教导，把参加检修的所有人员组织起来，活学活用毛泽东思想，把检修现场变成革命大批判的战场，理论联系实际的大课堂。广大革命职工怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚的无产阶级感情，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的“专家治厂”、“技术第一”等反革命修正主义路线，充分发动群众，结果只用了五天时间就完成了设备检修任务。
    在阶级斗争和生产斗争中，厂革委会还非常重视工人出身的技术人员和知识分子出身的技术人员一起，开展“一帮一”、“一对红”的活动，并经常组织知识分子出身的技术人员到车间和工人一起顶岗位生产，同抓革命，同学习，帮助知识分子出身的技术人员努力走和工农相结合的道路，走理论联系实际的道路，促进他们思想革命化，树立全心全意为人民服务的思想，为建立一支用毛泽东思想武装起来的崭新的技术队伍打下了良好的思想基础。
