After a heavy artillery bombardment, the People's Liberation Armed Forces' infantry units charged into the U.S. base from several directions, breached the barbed wire, and directly assaulted the base's central area. They skillfully and boldly used grenades, anti-tank guns, and submachine guns to destroy enemy vehicles and annihilate the American invaders hiding in fortifications and tanks. After nearly two hours of battle, the People's Liberation Armed Forces completely annihilated the U.S. 7th Artillery Battalion, two infantry companies, and an engineering unit, killing and wounding over 600 American invaders.
