The revolutionary workers of Hangzhou Machine Tool Factory have embodied the spirit of daring to think and daring to act, successfully developing a precision surface grinder at the world's advanced level. This precision grinder fills a gap in the variety of machine tools in our country, providing key equipment needed for the construction of the mechanical manufacturing industry and national defense industry.

New China News Agency, Hangzhou: The proletarian revolutionary faction and revolutionary workers of Hangzhou Machine Tool Factory, following the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings of self-reliance, arduous struggle, breaking superstitions, and liberating thoughts, have embodied the spirit of daring to think and daring to act. Recently, they successfully developed a precision surface grinder with a cross-working table.

The results of the appraisal by relevant departments show that the grinding precision and surface finish of this precision surface grinder have reached the world's advanced level. Its successful development fills a gap in the variety of machine tools in our country, providing key equipment needed for the construction of the mechanical manufacturing industry and national defense industry. This is a victory of Mao Zedong Thought and a fruitful achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The "Sixteen Points" personally drafted by Chairman Mao point out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a powerful driving force for the development of productive forces in our country." In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad revolutionary workers of Hangzhou Machine Tool Factory have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, deeply and persistently carried out revolutionary criticism and struggle, and comprehensively and systematically exposed and criticized the revisionist goods such as crawlingism, "expert management," "profit-first," and "material incentives" promoted by Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the factory. Some workshops have persisted in class struggle criticism before each shift for months, breaking through many rules and regulations set by Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in new product development and production management, liberating the thoughts of the broad revolutionary workers, establishing the ambition to climb the peaks of science and technology, and embodying revolutionary pioneering spirit.

In the process of developing this precision surface grinder, the broad proletarian revolutionary faction and revolutionary workers of the entire factory have studied and applied Chairman Mao's works actively, taken "The Three Constantly Read Articles" as their motto, transformed their worldview, and established the thought of wholeheartedly serving the people. Technical personnel have changed the situation of sitting in the office, being detached from reality, and coldly designing. They have gone deep into the workshops, closely cooperated with the production workers, operated and experimented together, researched and analyzed together, and absorbed the rich practical experience of the old workers into the design, greatly improving the design quality and shortening the design time. In the process of design and manufacturing, the broad revolutionary workers have also embodied the spirit of communist cooperation, pooled their wisdom, and overcome various technical and equipment difficulties. They have completed all manufacturing and assembly tasks in just over a year, significantly shortening the production cycle of this grinder compared to similar types of grinders.

　　杭州机床厂革命职工发扬敢想敢干的革命精神
　　试制成功世界先进水平的精密平面磨床
　　这台精密磨床填补了我国机床品种中的一个空白点，提供了机械制造工业和国防工业建设所需的关键设备
    新华社杭州电　杭州机床厂的无产阶级革命派和革命职工，遵循伟大领袖毛主席自力更生，艰苦奋斗，破除迷信，解放思想的教导，发扬敢想、敢干的革命精神，最近试制成功了一种十字工作台型精密平面磨床。
    有关部门鉴定的结果表明，这台精密平面磨床的磨削精度和光洁度都达到世界先进水平。它的试制成功，填补了我国机床品种中的一个空白点，提供了机械制造工业和国防工业建设所需的关键设备。这是毛泽东思想的胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的丰硕成果。
    毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”指出：“无产阶级文化大革命是使我国社会生产力发展的一个强大的推动力。”杭州机床厂的广大革命职工在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，深入持久地开展革命大批判，全面、系统地揭发批判了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在本厂代理人所推行的爬行主义和“专家治厂”、“利润挂帅”、“物质刺激”等修正主义黑货。有的车间几个月来，天天坚持班前大批判，打破了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在新产品试制和生产管理上设置的许多条条框框，使广大革命职工解放了思想，树立了敢于攀登科学技术高峰的雄心壮志，发扬了革命首创精神。
    在试制这种精密平面磨床的过程中，全厂广大无产阶级革命派和革命职工，活学活用毛主席著作，以“老三篇”为座右铭，改造世界观，树立全心全意为人民服务的思想。技术人员改变了坐在办公室，脱离实际，冷冷清清地搞设计的局面。他们深入车间，和生产工人紧密配合，一起操作试验，一起研究分析，把老工人丰富的实践经验吸收到设计中来，大大提高了设计质量，缩短了设计时间。在设计、制造过程中，广大革命职工还发扬共产主义协作精神，群策群力，克服了技术、设备上的种种困难，只用一年多时间就完成了全部制造和装配任务，使这台磨床的生产周期比同类型磨床缩短了很多。
