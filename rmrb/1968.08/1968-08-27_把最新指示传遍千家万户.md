Today, an immense sense of happiness and joy once again fills our hearts with the publication of Chairman Mao's latest directive! "To achieve the revolution in education led by the proletariat, it is necessary to have the leadership of the working class and the participation of the working masses..." The red waves carrying the latest directive soar through the skies, cross the seas, and reach the hearts of hundreds of millions of revolutionary people.

In a postal and telecommunications sub-bureau, as soon as the couriers heard the broadcast, they sprang into action. The revolutionary leading group's Old Jin and Little Lu immediately decided that all members should split into two groups: one group to propagate the latest directive in the staff dormitories, and the other to paint big-character slogans on the streets. They worked busily through the night, unwilling to go to sleep. Old Jin had to persuade everyone, "Comrades, we still have to deliver the newspapers with the latest directive tomorrow. Everyone should get some rest to ensure the completion of tomorrow's tasks."

Early in the morning, the couriers gathered again in the delivery room, discussing how to deliver the newspapers as quickly as possible while studying Chairman Mao's latest directive. Just as they were talking excitedly, Old Zhao entered from outside. Everyone asked in surprise, "Aren't you busy with something? Why are you here?"

Old Zhao waved his hand, "That's nothing!"

Indeed, Old Zhao had something important to attend to. He had a son and a daughter; his son enlisted in the army last year, and his daughter, who had just graduated from middle school, volunteered to settle down in the vast grasslands of Inner Mongolia. She was leaving that morning. Old Jin had specially arranged for him to take a rest to send his daughter off to the station. Before dawn, Old Zhao got up, helped his daughter pack her things, and tie her luggage. Following his usual habit, he turned on the radio, and what did he hear? Chairman Mao's latest directive! He dropped the rope in his hand, took out paper and pen, and carefully wrote down every word. After writing, he read it aloud twice, feeling a warm current surging through his body. He hurriedly told his daughter, "Dad won't send you off. I have to deliver the newspapers with the latest directive. That is the most important task. What I needed to tell you, I said yesterday. I just hope you will always listen to Chairman Mao and take root in the grasslands, and revolutionize to the end!" Saying this, Old Zhao solemnly handed his daughter the latest directive he had personally recorded: "Take it with you. This is the most precious gift from Dad."

The daughter fully understood her father's intentions and nodded repeatedly, saying, "Believe in me, Dad. The Red Guards by Chairman Mao's side will not disgrace him. I will definitely act according to the latest directive."

Old Zhao looked at his daughter's flushed face and listened to her resolute words, believing that the children of the working class would definitely make the working class proud and act according to Chairman Mao's directives. He walked out of the house with a reassured heart and came to the bureau.

The delivery team members did not know the situation, and seeing Old Zhao come in, Old Jin quickly said, "Our team is not short of people; I have already arranged everything. You only have one daughter, and she is going so far away. You should go and send her off."

Everyone also urged Old Zhao to go, but Old Zhao was determined, saying, "It's not about whether there are enough people or not. Chairman Mao's latest directive has been issued, and this is more important than anything else. It doesn't matter if I don't send my daughter off; we, the working class, are the leading class and cannot always think about personal matters."

Old Zhao's words left everyone speechless. Old Zhao continued excitedly, "On my way here, I thought, Chairman Mao trusts the working class the most. In the old society, the rich bullied us, calling us stinking mailmen. There was a school where I delivered letters for several years, but I never entered the school gate. In those days, how could poor people go to school! After liberation, our poor children had the chance to go to school, but the Chinese Khrushchev still used the old ways of the old society to lead our working class children down the wrong path, which is truly despicable! Now that Chairman Mao's latest directive has been issued, it will ensure that the working class forever leads the schools, and the Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist tricks will never succeed. Chairman Mao's words truly resonate with our hearts..." At this point, he recalled the happy scene a few days ago when he, representing all the employees of the bureau, was received by Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao was so busy, yet he still received us workers, which is the greatest care and trust Chairman Mao has for the working class, the greatest honor for the working class. Old Zhao could not continue speaking; tears filled his eyes.

"Newspapers are here!" A shout from outside was like a command, and everyone rushed out, grabbing the newspapers and starting the intense work. Some counted, some distributed, everyone worked silently, but with a common voice in their hearts: We postal and telecommunications workers are responsible for delivering Chairman Mao's latest directive, an unparalleled honor. We must be accurate, fast, and deliver Chairman Mao's latest directive to the broad revolutionary masses as quickly as possible. In less than a quarter of an hour, the newspapers were distributed, and the comrades packed the green mailbags full, hopped on their bicycles, and rushed out the door.

The streets were crowded with people, red flags fluttered, drums beat, and slogans and firecrackers echoed to the heavens. Old Zhao, riding his bicycle loaded with newspapers, sped past the parade, delivering Chairman Mao's latest directive to factories, villages, and every household.

    把最新指示传遍千家万户
    北京市邮局　陈文骐
    今天，无比的幸福和欢乐又一次来到我们中间，毛主席的最新指示发表了！“实现无产阶级教育革命，必须有工人阶级领导，必须有工人群众参加，……”传播最新指示的红色电波越过高空，飞过大海，传到了亿万革命人民的心中。
    在一个邮电支局里，投递员们刚一听到广播，就行动起来，革命领导小组的老金和小陆马上决定，全组同志兵分两路：一路到家属宿舍宣传最新指示，一路到大街上刷大标语。他们紧张地忙乎了半夜，还不肯去睡觉。老金只好动员大家：“同志们，明儿个咱们还得送刊登最新指示的报纸呢，大伙儿多少也得睡会儿，保证明天任务的完成。”
    大清早，投递员们就又都聚集在投递室了，你一言，我一语，一边学习毛主席的最新指示，一边商量着如何用最快的速度投送报纸。正说得热闹，投递员老赵从门外跨进来，大伙儿奇怪地问：“您不是有事吗，怎么来了？”
    老赵一摆手：“那算啥事！”
    老赵的确有事，他有一儿一女，儿子去年参军了，女儿初中毕业，自愿申请到内蒙古大草原安家落户，今儿个上午就走。老金特意给他安排了个休息，让他到车站送送女儿。天朦朦亮，老赵就起床了，帮女儿收拾东西，捆扎行李。按照平常的习惯，他顺手打开收音机，一听，啊，毛主席的最新指示！他扔下手里的行李绳，拿出了纸和笔，一字一句地记下来。记完了，他又仔仔细细念了两遍，只觉得一股暖流流遍全身，他急忙对女儿说：“爸爸不送你了，我要去送登着最新指示的报纸，那是最重要的事。该嘱咐的，我昨天都说了，只希望你永远听毛主席的话，扎根在草原，革命到底！”说罢，老赵把自己亲手记录下来的最新指示珍重地递给了女儿：“带上吧，这是爸送给你的最珍贵的礼物。”
    女儿完全懂得爸爸的心思，连连点着头说：“您相信我吧，毛主席身边的红卫兵决不会给他老人家丢脸的，我一定按照最新指示办。”
    老赵看着女儿红通通的脸，听着她那坚决的话音，相信工人阶级的孩子，是一定会给工人阶级争气的，是一定会按毛主席指示办事的。他放心地走出屋，就到局里来了。
    投递组的同志可不了解这些情况，一看老赵来了，老金忙说：“咱组里不缺人，我都安排好了。你就这一个女儿，又走那么远，还是送送吧。”
    大伙儿也都催老赵走，老赵可是铁了心，他说：“不是缺人不缺人的问题，毛主席最新指示发表了，这是比啥都重要的事。女儿不送有啥关系，咱工人阶级是领导阶级，不能老想着个人的事儿呀！”
    老赵这一段话说得同志们哑口无言。老赵激动地接着说：“我从家来，一路上就想，毛主席他老人家最信得过咱工人阶级。旧社会，有钱人欺负咱，管咱们叫臭邮差。有个学校，我去送了好几年信，从没进去过校门一步。那年头儿，哪有穷人上学的份儿啊！解放后，咱穷人的孩子有学上了，可是，中国赫鲁晓夫还叫学校来旧社会那一套，把咱工人的后代往坏路上引，真可恶！这回毛主席最新指示发表了，让咱工人阶级永远领导学校，中国赫鲁晓夫那套修正主义玩艺儿，就永远也办不到了。毛主席的话真是句句说到咱们心坎上了……”说到这儿，他想起几天前自己代表全局职工受到毛主席接见的幸福情景，毛主席工作那么忙，还接见我们工人代表，这是毛主席对工人阶级的最大关怀，最大信任，这是工人阶级的最大光荣。老赵说不下去了，泪水已涌满了他的双眼。
      “报纸来了！”门外一声喊，就象一声号令，大家都跑出去，抢着把报纸搬进来，开始了紧张工作。有的数，有的分，大家无声地战斗着，但都有一个共同的心声：我们邮电工人担负传递毛主席最新指示的任务，无尚光荣，一定要准确，要快，要用最快的速度把毛主席的最新指示送到广大革命群众手中。不到一刻钟，报纸分发好了，同志们把绿色邮包装得满满的，跨上自行车飞出大门。
    街上人山人海，红旗飘舞，战鼓齐鸣，口号声、鞭炮声直冲云霄。老赵骑着满载报纸的车，从游行队伍旁飞驰而过，他和同志们一起，把毛主席的最新指示送到了工厂农村，千家万户。
