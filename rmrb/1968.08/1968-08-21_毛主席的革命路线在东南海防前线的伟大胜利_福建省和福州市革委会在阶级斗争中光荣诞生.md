The great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line on the southeast coast defense front! The revolutionary committees of Fujian Province and Fuzhou City were born in the storm of class struggle!

On August 20, 400,000 military personnel and civilians gathered in Fuzhou to celebrate, enthusiastically shouting: "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!" They unanimously declared: Under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, we must unite more closely, use Mao Zedong Thought to unify our understanding, steps, and actions, cherish, support, and defend the newly born revolutionary committees; carry out revolutionary criticism, do a good job in struggle, criticism, and reform; strengthen military-civilian unity, enhance vigilance, strengthen preparedness, and be ready at any time to decisively, thoroughly, completely, and entirely annihilate the daringly invading American and Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and be ready at any time to liberate Taiwan.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, August 20 — Under the brilliant guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and under the warm care of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, a victory report has been sent from the forefront of the anti-American and anti-Chiang struggle on the southeast coast defense line of the motherland: The revolutionary committees of Fujian Province and Fuzhou City were born simultaneously in the storm of class struggle!

This is a great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and a great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution on the forefront of the motherland's battlefields. This great victory has significant implications for consolidating and strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat on the forefront of the southeast coast defense line, for liberating the sacred territory of Taiwan, and for supporting the struggle of the oppressed peoples and nations around the world against American imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries.

Thirty-nine years ago, the great leader Chairman Mao led the workers and peasants' red army, "marching straight to Longyan and Hangzhou," spreading the seeds of armed struggle from Jinggangshan to Fujian, and establishing the Red Base in Minxi. At the "Gutian Conference," Chairman Mao personally wrote the resolution "On Rectifying Erroneous Thoughts within the Party," which has epoch-making significance, setting a great program for the construction of our party and army. Under Chairman Mao's wise leadership, the revolutionary people of Fujian, together with the people of the entire country, have gone through decades of arduous struggle and won liberation. After liberation, they continued to hold their guns, fighting side by side with the frontline troops, severely striking the most ferocious American imperialism and its running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, in the Taiwan Strait, and various provocations and sabotage activities, defending the socialist revolution and socialist construction of the motherland, and bringing about tremendous changes in Fujian Province.

In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary masses of Fujian Province and the broad revolutionary masses launched a fierce struggle against the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Fujian, Ye Fei, Fan Shiren, Hou Zhenya, and other small groups of traitors, spies, counter-revolutionaries, and stubborn capitalist-roaders, thoroughly smashing their plot to restore capitalism in Fujian. In the fierce struggle, the revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses repeatedly defeated the rampant counterattacks of a small group of class enemies, achieving decisive victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The great leader Chairman Mao and the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin have always been deeply concerned about the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Fujian Province. At every critical moment of class struggle, Chairman Mao has given the most timely and wise instructions. Chairman Mao's warm care and a series of latest instructions have given the 17 million people of Fujian Province immense encouragement and boundless strength. The revolutionary masses of the entire province and the broad revolutionary masses, with deep proletarian feelings of loyalty to Chairman Mao, have firmly marched forward along the course indicated by Chairman Mao, holding high the great banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries."

"Without a people's army, there would be nothing for the people." The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army in Fujian Province have responded resolutely to the great order of the great commander Chairman Mao, "The People's Liberation Army should support the broad leftist masses," enthusiastically using Mao Zedong Thought to propagate, organize, and arm the masses, firmly grasping the direction of the struggle, uniting with the revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses, fighting together, and winning together. The soldiers of the three services on the Fujian front have made tremendous achievements in defending the coastal defense of the motherland and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and in the glorious "three supports, two militaries" work.

"Below the mountains, below the mountains, the red flags flutter like paintings." On August 19, the provincial capital of Fujian, Fuzhou, was adorned with red flags and drums, with 400,000 military personnel and civilians, holding high the giant portrait of Chairman Mao, waving the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," singing and dancing, welcoming the radiant sun, holding a grand rally to enthusiastically celebrate the birth of the revolutionary committees of Fujian Province and Fuzhou City.

The celebration rally began with the majestic music of "The East Is Red." When the rally solemnly announced the birth of the revolutionary committees of Fujian Province and Fuzhou City, the entire venue erupted in cheers, and the atmosphere was boiling. People, with deep proletarian feelings of loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, repeatedly raised their arms and shouted: "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!" "Long live the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China!" "Long live the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

On the joyous day of celebrating the birth of the revolutionary committees of Fujian Province and Fuzhou City, from the lush forests of Wuyi Mountain to the vast plains of Zhangzhou, from the revolutionary old base area of Minxi to the coast of the East China Sea where the military bugles sound, the broad revolutionary masses repeatedly wished our heart's red sun, Chairman Mao, eternal life! Eternal life!

Comrade Han Xianchu, the head of the Fujian Provincial Revolutionary Committee, spoke at the celebration rally. He said, the birth of the Fujian Provincial Revolutionary Committee is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and the result of the warm care and wise leadership of the great commander Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms, Vice Commander Lin, and the Party Central Committee and the Central Cultural Revolution Group.

Comrade Han Xianchu said, the ship sails with the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. After the establishment of the revolutionary committee, the most important and fundamental task is to carry out the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought more extensively and deeply throughout the province. We must do a better job of holding various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, direct everything, and transform everything. We must use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to "criticize selfishness and revisionism," break with selfishness and establish public-mindedness, transform our worldview, and greatly promote the ideological revolution of the revolutionary people of the entire province. We must grasp the line of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, launch a fierce and sustained attack on the class enemies. We must further carry out revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticize and expose the "independent kingdom" and the reactionary "multi-center theory" of Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Fujian, Ye Fei and his ilk, and completely eliminate the poison of counter-revolutionary revisionism. At the same time, we must mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, and resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's recent great order to do a good job in cleaning up the class ranks, accurately and firmly strike the class enemies, thoroughly expose a small group of traitors, spies, stubborn capitalist-roaders, other counter-revolutionaries, and landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who have not been reformed. We must strive to achieve revolutionary great unity by system, industry, and class, promote the establishment, consolidation, and development of revolutionary committees at all levels. We must strictly distinguish between enemy contradictions and contradictions among the people, unite and win over allies, and continuously expand the revolutionary ranks. We must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's policy on cadres, correctly identify and treat cadres, help good and relatively good cadres who have made mistakes but are willing to correct them to stand up and make new contributions to the people, so that all revolutionary forces, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, unite as one and fight against the enemy together.

Comrade Han Xianchu said, Fujian is located on the coastal defense front. The entire military and civilian population must further enhance their vigilance and never allow the class enemies to succeed in their plot to sow discord between the military and the civilians. The People's Liberation Army must firmly believe in, rely on, and protect the broad revolutionary masses, and the revolutionary masses must firmly believe in, rely on, and support the People's Liberation Army. We must strengthen preparedness and be ready at any time to decisively, thoroughly, completely, and entirely annihilate the daringly invading American and Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and be ready at any time to liberate Taiwan.

Comrade Han Xianchu said, we must follow Chairman Mao's teaching of "simplifying the bureaucracy and organizing a revolutionary leadership cadre group that is connected with the masses," and strive to strengthen the construction of revolutionary committees at all levels. The members of the revolutionary committees must use Mao Zedong Thought to hold power well and use power well, forever maintain the character of the working people, closely connect with the masses, be the students of the masses, be good servants of the people, and be thorough proletarian revolutionaries. We must thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of Chinese Khrushchev, build the revolutionary committees into a battle command post that is forever loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, highlighting proletarian politics, full of vigor, and closely connected with the masses. We must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production, work, and preparedness," insist on local revolution, part-time revolution, and economical revolution, and strive to achieve double victories in revolution and production.

Comrade Han Xianchu finally said, our great leader Chairman Mao recently taught us: "Our country has 700 million people, and the working class is the leading class. We must fully play the leading role of the working class in the cultural revolution and all work. The working class should also continuously improve its political awareness in the struggle." We, the working class, should firmly remember this teaching, play a better leading role in the cultural revolution, and have a stronger sense of responsibility as masters on the production and construction front. All revolutionary intellectuals and young students must firmly take the road of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers. We must always remember class struggle, always remember the dictatorship of the proletariat, always remember highlighting proletarian politics, and always remember holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. We must unite under the wise leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in terms of ideology, politics, economy, and organization, and let the great red banner of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought fly high and forever in Fujian Province!

Comrade Pi Dingjun, a responsible comrade of the People's Liberation Army in Fujian Province and a deputy head of the Fujian Provincial Revolutionary Committee, spoke on behalf of the soldiers of the three services on the Fujian front, enthusiastically congratulating the birth of the revolutionary committees of Fujian Province and Fuzhou City. He said, the closer the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to comprehensive victory, the more a small group of class enemies will struggle desperately. The broad soldiers of the three services on our front are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, highlight proletarian politics, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever be loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and forever be loyal to the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. Following Chairman Mao's great teaching of "The rights obtained by the people must not be easily lost and must be defended by struggle," we will be the strong backing of the revolutionary committees at all levels, trust, respect, support, and defend the revolutionary committees, always maintain close ties with the people, and together with the revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres, keep our eyes open, closely watch the new moves of the class enemies, and thoroughly smash all their sabotage plots. We must strengthen preparedness, enhance vigilance, and be ready at any time to "spare no effort to annihilate the invading enemy."

Comrades Lan Hongyu, deputy heads of the Fujian Provincial Revolutionary Committee, and other revolutionary leading cadres also spoke at the rally.

Representatives of revolutionary workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and revolutionary Red Guards spoke at the rally. They unanimously declared that under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, we must unite more closely, use Mao Zedong Thought to unify our understanding, steps, and actions, thoroughly criticize the reactionary bourgeois "multi-center is no center" theory, strengthen the proletarian concept of the whole, cherish, support, and defend the newly born revolutionary committees. In the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, we must greatly enhance our awareness of the enemy, unite as one, and fight against the enemy together. We must more universally hold various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, "criticize selfishness and revisionism," and better promote the ideological revolution of the broad revolutionary masses. We must carry out revolutionary criticism more deeply and sustainedly, do a good job in struggle, criticism, and reform in our units. We must further carry out the "support the army and love the people" movement, strengthen military-civilian unity, consolidate national defense, strengthen preparedness, and be ready at any time to liberate Taiwan. We must grasp revolution, promote production, work, and preparedness, and turn Fujian Province into a big school of red Mao Zedong Thought.

Comrades Zhu Yaohua, Ye Song, Wu Hongxiang, Huang Yaguang, Zhuang Zhiping, Tian Yumin, Hong Xiuting, Zheng Huopai, and Wang Yunji, deputy heads of the Fujian Provincial Revolutionary Committee, and comrades from the Fujian Provincial and Fuzhou City Revolutionary Committees, and responsible comrades from the People's Liberation Army in Fujian Province and the Fuzhou Garrison attended the celebration rally.

Participants in the celebration rally also included combat heroes and militia heroes from the three services on the Fujian front, as well as labor models from various parts of Fujian.

The rally, in the midst of thunderous cheers and applause, passed a telegram of respect to the most beloved great leader Chairman Mao.

After the rally, a grand celebration parade was held.

    毛主席的革命路线在东南海防前线的伟大胜利
    福建省和福州市革委会在阶级斗争中光荣诞生
    四十万军民在福州集会庆祝，热烈欢呼：“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”他们一致表示：一定要在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的领导下，更加紧密地团结起来，用毛泽东思想统一认识、统一步伐、统一行动，爱护、支持和保卫新生的革委会；开展革命大批判，搞好斗批改；加强军民团结，提高警惕，加强战备，随时准备坚决、彻底、干净、全部地歼灭敢于来犯的美蒋匪帮，随时准备解放台湾
    新华社福州二十日电　在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的光辉照耀下，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的亲切关怀下，祖国东南海防前哨、反美反蒋斗争的最前线传来了胜利的捷报：福建省和福州市革命委员会，在阶级斗争的风暴中同时胜利诞生了！
    这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命在祖国前哨阵地的伟大胜利。这一伟大胜利，对祖国东南海防最前线的无产阶级专政的巩固和加强，对解放祖国神圣领土台湾，对支援世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族反对美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和各国反动派的斗争，都具有重大的意义。
    早在三十九年前，伟大领袖毛主席率领工农红军，“直下龙岩上杭”，把井冈山武装斗争的火种传播到福建，创立了闽西红色根据地。在“古田会议”上，毛主席亲手写下了《关于纠正党内的错误思想》这篇具有划时代意义的决议，为我党我军的建设制定了伟大的纲领。在毛主席的英明领导下，福建革命人民群众同全国人民一道，经过几十年的艰苦奋斗，赢得了解放。解放后，他们继续紧握手中枪，和前线三军并肩战斗，狠狠打击了世界上最凶恶的美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石匪帮在台湾海峡的战争挑衅和各种破坏活动，保卫了祖国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设，使福建省的面貌发生了巨大的变化。
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，福建无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，向中国赫鲁晓夫及其在福建的代理人叶飞、范式人、侯振亚等一小撮叛徒、特务、反革命分子和顽固不化的走资派展开激烈的斗争，彻底粉碎了他们妄图在福建复辟资本主义的阴谋。在激烈的斗争中，无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，一次又一次地击溃了一小撮阶级敌人的猖狂反扑，夺得了无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利。
    伟大领袖毛主席和以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，一直非常关怀福建省的无产阶级文化大革命。每当阶级斗争的关键时刻，毛主席都给予最及时、最英明的指示。毛主席的亲切关怀和一系列最新指示给福建省一千七百万人民以巨大的鼓舞，无穷的力量。全省无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，怀着无限忠于毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情，高举“对反动派造反有理”的大旗，坚定地沿着毛主席指引的航向奋勇前进。
    “没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”人民解放军福建前线陆、海、空三军指战员，坚决响应伟大统帅毛主席“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号令，满腔热情地用毛泽东思想宣传群众，组织群众，武装群众，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，同无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。福建前线三军指战员在保卫祖国海防，保卫无产阶级文化大革命的伟大斗争中，在光荣的“三支”“两军”工作中，作出了巨大的成绩。
    “山下山下，风展红旗如画。”八月十九日，福建省省会福州市，红旗招展，锣鼓喧天，四十万军民怀着胜利的喜悦和战斗的革命豪情，簇拥着毛主席巨幅画像，挥动着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，载歌载舞，迎着灿烂的朝阳，举行盛大集会，热烈庆祝福建省和福州市革命委员会胜利诞生。
    庆祝大会在雄壮的《东方红》乐曲声中开始。当大会庄严宣告福建省和福州市革命委员会光荣诞生的时候，全场欢声雷动，群情沸腾，人们怀着无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的深厚无产阶级感情，不断振臂高呼：“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！”“伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党万岁！”“伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    在欢庆福建省和福州市革命委员会诞生的大喜日子里，从森林茂密的武夷山到稻菽千重浪的漳州平原，从革命老根据地闽西到军号嘹亮的东海之滨，广大革命群众一遍又一遍地祝愿我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    福建省革命委员会主任韩先楚同志在庆祝大会上讲了话。他说，福建省革命委员会的胜利诞生，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，是伟大统帅毛主席和他的亲密战友副统帅林副主席和党中央、中央文革亲切关怀和英明领导的结果。这是全省一千七百万人民和福建前线三军全体指战员的大喜事。
    韩先楚同志说，大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。革命委员会成立后，最首要、最根本的一条任务，就是在全省更广泛更深入地开展活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动。要更多地办好各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，用毛泽东思想统帅一切、指导一切、改造一切。要以毛泽东思想为武器，“斗私，批修”，破私立公，改造世界观，大力促进全省革命人民的思想革命化。我们要抓好阶级斗争、两条路线斗争这一个纲，向阶级敌人展开猛烈的持久的进攻。要进一步开展革命大批判，把中国赫鲁晓夫及其在福建的代理人叶飞之流的“独立王国”和反动的“多中心论”，批倒批臭，彻底肃清反革命修正主义流毒。同时，要放手发动群众，依靠群众，坚决贯彻执行毛主席最近批发的伟大号令，搞好清理阶级队伍工作，稳、准、狠地打击阶级敌人，彻底揭露一小撮叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派、其他反革命分子和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子。要努力实现按系统、按行业、按班级的革命大联合，促进各级革命委员会的成立、巩固和发展。要严格区分敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾，团结和争取同盟军，不断壮大革命队伍。要坚决执行毛主席的干部政策，正确识别和对待干部，帮助好的和比较好的、犯了错误愿意改正的干部站出来，为人民立新功，使一切革命力量在毛主席革命路线指引下，团结一致，共同对敌。
    韩先楚同志说，福建地处海防前线，全省军民一
  定要更加提高警惕，决不能让阶级敌人挑拨军民关系
  的阴谋得逞。人民解放军要坚决相信、依靠、保护广
  大革命群众，革命群众也要坚决相信、依靠、拥护人
  民解放军。要加强战备，随时准备坚决、彻底、干净、
  全部地歼灭敢于来犯的美蒋匪帮，随时准备解放台湾。
      韩先楚同志说，我们要遵照毛主席“精兵简政，
  组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子”的教导，
  大力加强各级革命委员会的建设。革命委员会成员要
  用毛泽东思想掌好权、用好权，永远保持劳动人民的
  本色，密切联系群众，做群众的小学生，当好人民的勤务员，做彻底的无产阶级革命派。要彻底批判中国赫
  鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，把革命委员会建设成
  永远忠于毛主席、永远忠于毛泽东思想、永远忠于
  毛主席的革命路线，突出无产阶级政治，朝气勃勃，
  密切联系群众的战斗指挥部。要坚决贯彻执行毛主席
  “抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”的伟大方针，
  坚持就地闹革命，业余闹革命，节约闹革命，鼓足干
  劲，力争上游，夺取革命、生产双胜利。
      韩先楚同志最后说，我们的伟大领袖毛主席最近
  教导我们：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要
  充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”我们工人阶级应该牢牢记住这一教导，在文化大革命中更好地发挥主力军的作用，在生产建设战线上更加强主人翁的责任心。一切革命的知识分子和青年学生，要坚定地走上同工农兵相结合的道路。我们应当念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出无产阶级政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。我们应当统一在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的英明领导下，从思想上、政治上、经济上、组织上夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，让战无不胜的毛泽东思想伟大红旗在福建全省高高飘扬，永远飘扬！
    中国人民解放军福建前线部队负责人、福建省革命委员会副主任皮定均同志，代表人民解放军福建前线陆、海、空三军指战员在大会上讲话，热烈祝贺福建省和福州市革命委员会光荣诞生。他说，无产阶级文化大革命越是接近全面胜利，一小撮阶级敌人越是要进行垂死的挣扎。我们前线三军广大指战员，决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，永远忠于以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部。遵循毛主席“人民得到的权利，绝不允许轻易丧失，必须用战斗来保卫”的伟大教导，誓做各级革命委员会的坚强后盾，信任、尊重、支持和保卫革命委员会，始终同人民群众保持血肉联系，同革命群众和革命干部一起，擦亮眼睛，密切注视阶级敌人的新动向，彻底粉碎他们的一切破坏阴谋。我们一定要加强战备，提高警惕，随时准备“全力以赴，务歼入侵之敌”。
