On the night of Sunday, the New China Printing Factory's letterpress workshop was brightly lit. Workers were busy at their machines. The offset press hummed with a crisp, rhythmic sound. Normally, people should be resting on Sundays, but why were they working so intensely now? It turned out that they were printing the latest directives from Chairman Mao, which had just been issued that day.

After receiving Chairman Mao's latest directives, the workshop leader asked everyone excitedly, "Chairman Mao has such trust in us revolutionary workers. What should we do?"

His words had barely left his mouth when the entire workshop erupted in cheers. Amidst the cheers, a worker shouted to everyone, "Comrades, Chairman Mao trusts us workers so much. We must love Chairman Mao even more. We must print Chairman Mao's latest directives quickly and distribute them to the masses. Although today is a day of rest, printing Chairman Mao's latest directives makes this day of rest all the more meaningful." His suggestion was met with a round of enthusiastic applause.

They decided to act immediately, the faster the better. Some cut paper, some set type, and others assembled the plates.

Just then, the ailing old worker Wang Caibao also rushed to the workshop to join the battle.

"Old Wang, you're sick. Go rest!" the workers urged him.

"Printing Chairman Mao's latest directives is a joyous occasion. How could I not participate? This little illness is nothing!" Wang Caibao said enthusiastically.

Wang Caibao truly deserves to be called a good worker of Chairman Mao. Before liberation, he was a poor child, living worse than cattle, and was bullied everywhere. After liberation, he became a printer and gained a new life. For over a decade, he has worked tirelessly, never shying away from hardship or fatigue. Wherever there is difficulty, he fights on, diligently serving the revolution.

With everyone's joint efforts, Chairman Mao's latest directives were quickly printed. The workers, with a fighting spirit, delivered the directives to various government agencies, factories, and schools in the capital, and into the hands of the revolutionary masses. Everyone said, "Today, we spent a meaningful day of rest."

    有意义的休息日
    星期天的夜晚，新华印刷厂铅印车间灯火通明。工人们都在机器旁紧张地工作着。平印机发出清脆而有节拍的响声。星期天人们本来都该休息，为什么现在还在紧张地战斗？原来，他们正在印刷今天刚刚发表的毛主席的最新指示。
    当毛主席的最新指示传来以后，车间负责人以激动的心情问大家：“毛主席他老人家对我们革命工人这样信任，我们应该怎么办？”
    他的话音刚落，整个车间沸腾起来了。在欢呼声中，一位工人高声对大家说：“同志们，毛主席对我们工人阶级这样信得过，我们更要无限热爱毛主席。我们一定要把毛主席的最新指示迅速印出来，散发到广大群众中去。今天虽然是休息日，可是印刷毛主席的最新指示，就使休息日变得更有意义。”他的意见获得了大家一阵热烈的掌声。
    说干就干，越快越好。一场紧张的战斗开始了。裁纸的裁纸，排字的排字，拼版的拼版。
    就在这时，有病的老工人王财宝也赶到车间参加战斗。
      “老王，你有病，休息去吧！”工人们劝他说。
      “印刷毛主席的最新指示，是件大喜事。我怎么能不参加？这点小病算什么！”王财宝热情地说。
    王财宝，真不愧是毛主席的好工人。解放前，他是个苦孩子，生活不如牛马，处处受人欺辱。解放后，他当上了印刷工人，获得了新生。十多年来，不怕苦，不怕累，哪里有困难，他就战斗在哪里，兢兢业业为革命。
    在大家的共同努力下，毛主席的最新指示很快印好了。工人们又以战斗的姿态，分头把最新指示送到首都各机关、工厂、学校，送到革命群众的手里。大家都说：“我们今天过了一个有意义的休息日。”
