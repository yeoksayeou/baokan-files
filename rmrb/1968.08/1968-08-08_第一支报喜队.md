The first joyous delegation

On the night of August 5, a car flying red flags sped towards Zhongnanhai through the wind and rain in the streets of Beijing. The car was filled with workers from the Beijing Knitting Factory and soldiers from the People's Liberation Army who were supporting the leftist cause. They could not contain their excitement and repeatedly shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!" They sang "Father and mother are not as dear as Chairman Mao" over and over again. Along the way, their laughter, singing, and thunderous drumbeats pierced the quiet night sky, spreading the joyous news far and wide.

The wind blew in their faces, and the rain poured down, but it did not dampen the workers' spirits. Although some of them had raincoats, they were too excited to put them on. The rain soaked their clothes, but they did not feel cold; instead, they felt warm all over. This was because they were representing the entire factory's revolutionary workers, going to express their gratitude to Chairman Mao for his greatest care and support for the capital's workers and peasants' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team.

Just an hour earlier, when the deputy director of the revolutionary committee, Zhang Chengming, brought the precious gift of mangoes from Chairman Mao to the factory, all the workers shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" with tears of joy. They rushed and crowded to be the first to see the precious gift sent by Chairman Mao. The workers deeply felt that Chairman Mao had given them not just mangoes, but his greatest concern, care, and support for the workers and peasants!

When the revolutionary committee members carried the mangoes to each workshop, how many workers held the mangoes, looked at them again and again, and smelled them again and again! The workers, in order to spread this great joyous news throughout the city as quickly as possible, braved the wind and rain to go out into the streets to paste big character posters. They loudly proclaimed, "We must paste the big character posters in the most prominent and eye-catching places!"

"We must express our loyalty to Chairman Mao through the night," this was the unanimous demand of the revolutionary workers. To go to Zhongnanhai to report the joyous news, they wanted to write the best declaration of resolve. At that time, how many people gathered around, with pairs of affectionate eyes looking at the person writing, Xiaowang.

"Xiaowang, write well, write about the heart-to-heart, flesh-and-blood relationship between Chairman Mao and us!"

"Use the best words and most beautiful language to express our boundless love for Chairman Mao, a loyal heart..."

Xiaowang's whole body was boiling with excitement. He tightly gripped the pen, held his breath, and wrote with all his passion and wisdom. After the declaration of resolve was written, the workers immediately reviewed it word by word. They demanded that every word and every sentence could most sincerely and passionately express their loyalty to Chairman Mao.

Hurry up and send the declaration of resolve to Zhongnanhai! Send it to our beloved Chairman Mao, let Chairman Mao see the three thousand red hearts of the Beijing Knitting Factory.

The joyous car was speeding, and the workers were even more excited. Xiaowang, a female worker who had just finished her night shift, heard the news of reporting the joyous event and was so excited that she did not even have time to change her work clothes before getting on the car. When she saw the magnificent lights of Zhongnanhai, a warm current surged to her heart. She said to a soldier beside her in a trembling voice, "Old Li, we have arrived at Zhongnanhai. Please bring me a bowl of water from Zhongnanhai to drink. Zhongnanhai is where Chairman Mao lives, and the water there is the sweetest!"

The young female worker Xiaoheng, with two short braids, looked particularly spirited. She was so excited that she did not know what to say. Usually, she rarely played the drum, but today she volunteered to be the drummer. She tightly gripped the drumsticks, her eyes fixed on the lights of Zhongnanhai, and beat the drum with all her might. She wanted to beat out the workers' loyal heart to Chairman Mao, she wanted the drumbeats to be heard by all the people of the city, and she wanted Chairman Mao to hear them! The drumbeats reminded her of the three times she had come to Zhongnanhai to report joyous news during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution: the first time was also a rainy night. At that time, it was when Liu Shaoqi was crazily pushing the capitalist reactionary line, Xiaoheng and the revolutionary masses in the factory were suppressed so much that they could hardly breathe. Just at this critical moment, Chairman Mao wrote the big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters," giving the revolutionary masses support. The "Sixteen Points" formulated under Chairman Mao's personal leadership were published, and Xiaoheng burst into tears as soon as she heard the broadcast. They braved the wind and rain and walked to the reception station of Zhongnanhai. In front of the gates of Zhongnanhai, she seemed to see the great leader Chairman Mao supporting and guiding the working class, adding boundless confidence and strength to herself! From then on, she became bolder, her heart redder, her eyes brighter, and her feet more firmly planted. She, together with the revolutionary masses, under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, carried deep hatred and bravely fought against Liu Shaoqi's capitalist reactionary line! The second time was when the factory established the revolutionary committee. At that time, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's series of brilliant instructions on achieving great unity, the three-in-one combination, and "the revolutionary committee is good," and with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army supporting the left, the revolutionary workers of the Beijing Knitting Factory ended Liu Shaoqi's evil activities of splitting the Beijing Knitting Factory into two factions. The two revolutionary factions united on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought! A new red power—the revolutionary committee—was established! This time, Chairman Mao presented the precious mangoes to the capital's workers and peasants' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, and Xiaoheng came to Zhongnanhai to report the joyous news for the third time. She recalled the scenes of reporting the joyous news time and time again, recalling Chairman Mao's parental love, care, and support for the Beijing Knitting Factory and the workers and peasants across the country, and tears streamed down her face. She silently said in her heart, "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Who cares for us the most? It is you, Chairman Mao! Who loves us the most? It is you, Chairman Mao! Who supports us the most? It is you, Chairman Mao! We will forever be loyal to the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin!" Then she beat the big drum with all her might, and the drumbeats shook the heavens.

The joyous car arrived at the reception station, and the workers quickly jumped off, shouting slogans and waving the Little Red Book, surging forward. They were the first delegation to express gratitude for Chairman Mao's care.

The red flags fluttered, and the lights shone brightly. The representatives of the Beijing Knitting Factory stood in front of the portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao, holding a red declaration of resolve, and solemnly swore: We will definitely do the following: hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought in our hands; keep the line of class struggle in our minds; follow the socialist bright path indicated by you; and follow your proletarian revolutionary line in our hearts.

This is the oath of the more than three thousand revolutionary workers of the Beijing Knitting Factory, and it is also the voice of the revolutionary people of the whole country. This sincere and powerful voice echoed throughout the rivers and mountains of the motherland.

　　第一支报喜队
　　红辉
    八月五日深夜，在北京的街道上，一辆飘扬着红旗的汽车，迎着风雨飞速地向中南海方向行驶。车上满坐着北京针织总厂的职工和支左的解放军同志，他们按捺不住激动的心情，一次又一次地高呼“毛主席万岁，毛主席万岁！”一遍又一遍地高唱“爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲”。一路上，他们的笑声、歌声和震天动地的锣鼓声，划破了平静的夜空，把振奋人心的喜讯传向了四面八方。
    风在迎面扑来，雨在当头洒下，但丝毫也影响不了职工同志欢腾的情绪。他们之中虽然有人拿着雨衣，可是激动得也忘记穿了。雨水浸湿了衣衫，他们并没有感到凉意，反而觉得浑身热呼呼的。因为他们是代表全厂广大革命职工，为了感谢毛主席对首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队的最大的关怀和支持，去向毛主席表忠心的。刚才工厂里广大革命职工中那一件件动人的情景依然在激动着他们：
    一个小时前，当革委会副主任张成明把毛主席赠送首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队的珍贵礼品芒果拿到厂里的时候，全厂的职工一边含着热泪高喊着“毛主席万岁！”一边拥着挤着，都想最先看到毛主席送来的珍贵礼品。职工们深深感到，毛主席赠送的不只是芒果，而是对工人、农民的最大关心、最大爱护、最大支持！当革委会的同志捧着芒果送到各个车间的时候，多少工人捧着芒果看了又看，闻了又闻呵！职工们为了让这一特大喜讯迅速传遍全城，连夜冒着风雨到街上去贴大标语。他们响亮的提出：“要把大标语刷到最注目，最显眼的地方去！”
    “要连夜报出热爱毛主席的一颗忠心”，这是广大革命职工的一致要求。他们为了到中南海报喜，要把决心书“写得最好最好”。当时又有多少人围在一起，一双双深情的眼睛望着执笔人小王同志。
    “小王，要好好写，要写出毛主席和我们心连心、骨肉亲的感情！”
    “要用最好最好的词句，最美最美的语言写出咱们对毛主席的无限热爱，一颗忠心……”
    小王同志全身热血沸腾，他紧紧攥着笔杆，屏住呼吸，在用自己的全部热情和智慧认真地写着。决心书写完，工人同志马上逐字逐句地进行修改，他们要求每个字，每句话都能最真挚，最热烈地表达出忠于毛主席的红心。
    尽快地把决心书送到中南海去！送给敬爱的毛主席，让毛主席他老人家能亲眼看到北京针织总厂三千多颗红心。
    报喜的汽车在急速飞驰，报喜的职工更加激动。坐在车上的女工小王刚刚下夜班，她一听说报喜，激动得连工作服也来不及换，就上了车。当她看到中南海那辉煌的灯火时，一股暖流冲上了她的心头，她用颤动的语音向身边的一位解放军同志说：“老李呀，到中南海啦，请你把中南海的水端一碗来给我喝，中南海是毛主席住的地方，那水是最香最甜的！”
    那位甩着两条短辫的青年女工小衡，显得格外的精神。她激动得简直不知说什么好，本来她很少擂鼓，可今天她抢着当了鼓手。她紧握着鼓槌，两眼望着中南海的灯火，使劲地敲呵敲呵，她要想敲出工人阶级对毛主席的一颗忠心，她想要敲出的鼓声让全城人民都听见，让毛主席能听见！咚咚的鼓声使她回忆起无产阶级文化大革命以来三次到中南海报喜的情景：第一次来的时候，那也是一个雨夜，当时正是中国赫鲁晓夫疯狂推行资产阶级反动路线的时候，小衡同厂里广大革命群众被压得连气都喘不过来。就在这关键时刻，毛主席写了《炮打司令部》的大字报，给革命群众撑了腰。毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”发表了，小衡一听到广播，刷一下涌出了热泪，他们冒着风雨，徒步来到了中南海接待站。在中南海门前，她仿佛看到伟大领袖毛主席在为工人阶级撑腰、指路，给自己增添了无穷的信心和力量！从此，她胆更壮，心更红，眼更亮，脚跟站得更稳。她同广大革命群众一道，在伟大领袖毛主席的领导下，带着千仇万恨，对中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线勇猛冲杀！第二次是厂里成立革委会时来的。那时，针织总厂的革命职工，在毛主席关于实现革命的大联合，革命的三结合，“革命委员会好”的一系列光辉指示指引下，在支左解放军同志的大力帮助下，结束了中国赫鲁晓夫把针织总厂分裂成为两大派的罪恶活动，两派革命群众在毛泽东思想的基础上联合起来了！成立了新生的红色政权——革命委员会！这一回，毛主席把珍品芒果赠送给首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队，小衡第三次又来到中南海报喜。她回想起这一次次报喜的情景，回想起毛主席对针织总厂，对全国工农那父母般的爱护、关怀和支持，她眼泪扑簌簌流下来。她暗暗地在心里说：“毛主席呵，毛主席！谁最关心我们，是您老人家！谁最爱护我们，是您老人家！谁最支持我们，是您老人家！我们要永远忠于以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部！”接着她使用全身力气擂着大鼓，鼓声惊天动地。
    报喜汽车到接待站了，职工们忙跳下车来，高呼着口号，挥动着语录，向前涌去。他们是答谢毛主席关怀的第一支报喜队。
    红旗招展，灯火辉煌，针织总厂的代表拿着鲜红的决心书站在伟大领袖毛主席画像前，庄严地宣誓：我们坚决做到，手中要有一面旗——毛泽东思想伟大红旗；脑中要有一条纲——阶级斗争的纲；眼里要有一条路——您老人家指引的社会主义光明路；心中要有一条线——您老人家的无产阶级革命路线。
    这是北京针织总厂三千多革命职工的誓言，也是全国革命人民的心声，这真挚、宏亮的声音，传遍了祖国的万水千山……（附图片）
