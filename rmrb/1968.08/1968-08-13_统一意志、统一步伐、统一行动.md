	Unity of Will, Unity of Steps, Unity of Action
	Shanghai Liberation Daily Editorial, August 7

	Editor's Note:
	The following editorial, titled "Unity of Will, Unity of Steps, Unity of Action," was originally published in the August 7 edition of the Shanghai Liberation Daily. Since our newspaper's editorial on August 5, which called for a thorough criticism of the reactionary bourgeois "multi-center theory," it has drawn the attention of the broad revolutionary masses. However, some people do not fully understand the great significance of this issue, and some even do not comprehend it. This editorial further analyzes the importance and necessity of criticizing the "multi-center theory," pointing out that the attitude towards the instructions of our great leader Chairman Mao and the attitude towards the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin is a matter of standing on which side in the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads. It is a question of whether to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end. This is a combative and excellent article, hence it is reprinted here. We must thoroughly eliminate the poisonous influence of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev. We must promptly expose and smash all the tricks and schemes of a handful of counter-revolutionaries who attempt to sabotage and split the proletarian headquarters. We must resolutely resist the bad practice of hypocritical two-faced individuals. We must further criticize manifestations of the bourgeois reactionary worldview such as factionalism, individualism, and sectarianism. The entire Party, the entire army, all revolutionary committees across the country, and the broad revolutionary masses must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, unite closely under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, and throw the rightist splitism of the "multi-center is no-center theory" into the garbage dump!

	On the joyous occasion of the second anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's "Bombard the Headquarters" big-character poster and the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," we received the joyous news that our great teacher and leader Chairman Mao presented precious gifts to the workers and peasants Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams in the capital. This is Chairman Mao's greatest concern, trust, support, and encouragement for the revolutionary people of the entire country. Our great leader is forever heart-to-heart with the masses. Under the inspiration of this joyous news, the revolutionary people of Shanghai must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, be infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, unite closely around the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and under the command of the proletarian headquarters, unite in will, unite in steps, and unite in action. We must firmly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, resolutely criticize the reactionary "multi-center theory," promptly expose and smash the tricks and schemes of a handful of class enemies who attempt to sabotage Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters, and seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	Great leader Chairman Mao taught us on the eve of the victory of the War of Liberation: "Strengthen discipline, and revolution will be invincible." At present, on the eve of the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we especially need to be infinitely loyal to the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and with a high degree of conscious organizational discipline, quickly and thoroughly implement every latest instruction of Chairman Mao and every battle command of the proletarian headquarters.

	Mao Zedong Thought is the contemporary Marxism-Leninism and the unified action program for the entire Party, the entire army, and the people of the entire country. To truly follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and advance victoriously under the unified leadership of the proletarian headquarters, the most fundamental thing is to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, especially to study and apply Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. First, we must study, and second, we must apply. We must apply what we have studied, and study for the purpose of applying.

	Currently, in our ranks, some people have been infected with a very bad study style. "Their method of studying Marxism is directly contrary to Marxism." They quote scriptures and talk big, not to guide their revolutionary practice, but to cover their bourgeois individualism with a red protective layer, so that it is not criticized. Some people do not seriously study and implement Chairman Mao's works and series of latest instructions but are eager for "small talk," enthusiastically discussing and circulating forged "speeches" and "documents," treating them as treasures. A small number of people who insist on "me first" are hypocritical and insincere towards Chairman Mao's instructions and the commands of the proletarian headquarters, and as long as they slightly touch their own small faction's interests, they will be two-faced and insincere. Even worse, they selectively use the highest instructions for their own benefit, shouting "resolutely implement" for what is beneficial to their faction, and rejecting, resisting, even distorting the highest instructions for what is not beneficial to their faction, deviating from and disrupting the strategic deployment of the proletarian headquarters.

	Towards Chairman Mao's instructions and all the battle commands of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, whether to seriously study and apply them, this is not just a simple matter of study style, but a matter of what attitude to take towards our great leader Chairman Mao and the proletarian headquarters. It is a matter of standing on which side in the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads. It is a matter of whether to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. In other words, it is a matter of stance, a matter of worldview. We must have sufficient understanding of the seriousness of this issue. Those who say one thing and do another will eventually degenerate into two-faced individuals and take the path of political degeneration. In the history of the communist movement in China and the world, are there not many such examples?

	The proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin is the concentrated representative of the fundamental interests of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary people, and the highest command center leading the proletariat and the broad revolutionary people in revolutionary struggles. Every proletarian revolutionary fighter and revolutionary person must be infinitely reverent and forever reverent towards the proletarian headquarters. Truth is in the hands of the proletarian headquarters. Without reverence, it will not do. Without Chairman Mao's instructions and the battle commands of the proletarian headquarters, it is to deviate from the truth and have no standard for judging right and wrong. The "multi-center theory" politically deviates from the leadership of the proletarian headquarters and in thought has "this is right and that is also right," with no definite views, and everything is based on whether it is beneficial to oneself. This is a reactionary bourgeois worldview and a corrosive agent that disperses the unity of the revolutionary ranks on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought.

	The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has brought about unprecedented high democracy. Under this high democracy, what guides our actions? It can only be the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. The democracy of the proletariat is democracy under highly centralized guidance. Highly centralized means centralized under Chairman Mao's instructions and the commands of the proletarian headquarters. Every revolutionary fighter must resolutely implement and thoroughly carry out every instruction of Chairman Mao and every command of the proletarian headquarters, whether understood or not understood, and deepen understanding in the process of implementation. We must not act on our own. We must remember Lenin's teaching: "The unconditional centralism and strict discipline of the proletariat are one of the basic conditions for its victory over the bourgeoisie."

### 统一意志、统一步伐、统一行动
上海《解放日报》八月七日社论

　　统一意志、统一步伐、统一行动
　　上海《解放日报》八月七日社论
　　编者的话
　　下面转载的这篇题为《统一意志、统一步伐、统一行动》的社论，原载八月七日上海《解放日报》。自本报八月五日社论提出彻底批判反动的资产阶级的“多中心论”以来，引起了广大革命群众的重视，但也有些人对这个问题的重大意义认识不足，甚至不理解。这篇社论进一步分析了批判“多中心论”的重要性和必要性，指出了对伟大领袖毛主席的指示抱什么态度，对以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部抱什么态度，这是一个在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争中站在哪一边的问题，是要不要将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的问题。这是一篇有战斗性的好文章，故转载于此。我们一定要肃清中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义路线的流毒。我们一定要及时地识破和粉碎一小撮反革命分子妄图破坏和分裂无产阶级司令部的一切阴谋诡计。我们一定要坚决抵制阳奉阴违的两面派的坏作风。我们一定要进一步批判山头主义、个人主义、宗派主义等等资产阶级反动世界观的各种表现。全党、全军、全国各革命委员会和广大革命群众，要更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，在以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的领导下紧密地团结起来，把右倾分裂主义的“多中心即无中心论”抛到垃圾堆里去！
    在纪念毛主席《炮打司令部》大字报和《中国共产党中央委员会关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》发表两周年的大喜日子里，传来了我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖毛主席向首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队赠送珍贵礼物的特大喜讯。这是毛主席对全国革命人民的最大关怀，最大信任，最大支持，最大鼓舞。我们的伟大领袖永远和群众心连心。在这个特大喜讯的鼓舞下，我们上海革命人民，一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席，紧紧团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的周围，在无产阶级司令部的号令下统一意志，统一步伐，统一行动，坚定不移地落实毛主席的最新指示，坚决批判反动的“多中心论”，及时地识破和粉碎一小撮阶级敌人妄图破坏毛主席的无产阶级司令部的阴谋诡计，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    伟大领袖毛主席在解放战争即将取得胜利的前夕教导我们：“加强纪律性，革命无不胜。”当前，在无产阶级文化大革命即将取得全面胜利的前夕，我们特别需要对以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部无限忠诚，以高度自觉的组织纪律性，迅速地、彻底地贯彻毛主席的每一个最新指示和无产阶级司令部的每一个战斗号令。
    毛泽东思想是当代的马克思列宁主义，是全党全军全国人民的统一的行动纲领。我们要真正做到紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在无产阶级司令部统一领导下胜利前进，最根本的一条，就是要活学活用毛泽东思想、特别是活学活用毛主席的一系列最新指示。第一是要学，第二是要用。学了要用，学是为了用。
    现在，在我们的队伍中，有些人沾染了一种极坏的学风。“他们学马克思主义的方法是直接违反马克思主义的。”他们引经据典，夸夸其谈，不是为了指导自己的革命实践，而是为了给自己的资产阶级个人主义涂上一层红色的保护剂，使它不受批判。有的人对毛主席的著作和一系列最新指示，不认真学习和贯彻，却热衷于“小道消息”，对那种伪造的“讲话”、“文件”津津乐道，翻印传抄，奉为至宝。有极少数坚持“以我为中心”的人，对毛主席的指示，对无产阶级司令部的号令，只要稍稍触犯了他那个小山头的利益，就阳奉阴违，口是心非。更恶劣的是，对最高指示各取所需、为我所用，对我一派有利者高喊“坚决照办”，对我一派无利者则排斥、抵制，甚至不惜断章取义，歪曲最高指示，背离和干扰无产阶级司令部的战略部署。
    对毛主席的指示，对以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的一切战斗号令，是不是认真学习，学了就用，这决不仅是个简单的学风问题，而是对待我们伟大领袖毛主席、对待无产阶级司令部抱什么态度的问题，是在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争中站在哪一边的问题，是要不要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的问题。就是说，这是立场问题，是世界观的问题。对于这个问题的严重性，必须有足够的认识。那种口头上一套、做的另是一套的人，发展下去，就会堕落成为两面派，走上政治上蜕化变质的道路。在中国和世界共产主义运动史上，这种事例难道还少吗？
    以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部是无产阶级和广大革命人民根本利益的集中代表，是领导无产阶级和广大革命人民进行革命斗争的最高指挥部。每一个无产阶级革命派战士和革命人民，对无产阶级司令部就是要无限崇拜，永远崇拜。真理在无产阶级司令部手里，不崇拜不得了。离开了毛主席的指示，离开了无产阶级司令部的战斗号令，就是离开了真理，就没有判断是非的标准。“多中心论”，在政治上脱离无产阶级司令部的领导，在思想上“此亦一是非，彼亦一是非”，毫无定见，一切以是否有利于自己为转移。这是一种反动的资产阶级世界观，是涣散革命队伍在毛泽东思想基础上的团结的腐蚀剂。
    史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，发扬了史无前例的高度民主。在这种高度的民主下，靠什么来指导我们的行动？只能靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想。无产阶级的民主，是在高度集中指导下的民主。高度集中，就是集中在毛主席的指示和无产阶级司令部的号令下。每一个革命战士，对毛主席的每一个指示和无产阶级司令部的每个号令，都必须坚决照办，彻底执行，理解的要执行，暂时不理解的也要执行，在执行过程中加深理解。决不能各行其是。我们要牢记列宁的教导：“无产阶级实行无条件的集中制和极严格的纪律，是它战胜资产阶级的基本条件之一。”
