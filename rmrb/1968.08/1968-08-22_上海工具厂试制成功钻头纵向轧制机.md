Shanghai Tool Factory recently installed a brand-new machine—the longitudinal rolling machine for drills. It can automatically and continuously roll hard high-speed steel rods into drill bits with strict shape requirements. Workers proudly call this machine the "pride machine."

Five years ago, an industrial delegation from a capitalist country visited the drill bit workshop of this factory. After walking around the workshop, they went to the workshop entrance where steel shavings and iron filings were piled up, and looked at the pile of iron filings again and again, even taking photos. It turned out that the amount of chips is an important indicator of a factory's mechanical processing technology level. Those people did this obviously to find some straw to say that our technology is backward. The workers saw this and remembered it, reciting Chairman Mao's great teachings: "The Chinese people have spirit, have ability, and will definitely catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level in the not-too-distant future." They made up their minds: they must bring glory to the motherland and must bring pride to the working class!

In 1965, the workshop's workers, technicians of worker origin, and revolutionary cadres formed a "three-in-one combination" research team to start trial-manufacturing the longitudinal rolling machine. They began with investigations and research, listening to workers' opinions, and visiting sister factories to learn, gaining great inspiration. They designed, researched, and manufactured simultaneously. To design a complex headstock, workers first cut out a model with hard paper and then molded it with clay. Only after getting a rough outline did they draw and manufacture. At this time, the capitalist roaders and bourgeois "experts" poured cold water and created obstacles from all sides, resulting in the research project being unable to enter production after one or two years.

In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionary forces seized the power usurped by a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, driving the bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities" off the stage. The members of the longitudinal rolling team were all spirited and full of fighting spirit. After the birth of the revolutionary committee, it continuously armed the team members with Mao Zedong Thought, making them undaunted in the face of difficulties.

With the assistance of sister units, the automatic control mechanism was quickly assembled. They explored experience in practice, step by step, and in the triumphant songs of the decisive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they finally successfully completed the trial-manufacturing task and quickly formally entered production. Using this longitudinal rolling machine to produce drills increases efficiency by more than twenty times compared to the original cutting processing, saves about 30% of precious steel materials, and extends the service life of drills by 50%.

    上海工具厂试制成功钻头纵向轧制机
    据新华社上海电　上海工具厂最近安装了一台崭新的机器——钻头纵向轧制机。它能自动连续地把一根根坚硬的高速钢，轧制成具有严格造型要求的钻孔刀具。工人同志们自豪地称这台机器是“争气机”。
    五年以前，有一个资本主义国家的工业代表团到这个厂的钻头车间参观，在车间里兜了一圈，就跑到车间门口堆放钢屑、铁末子的地方，围着铁屑堆看了又看，还拍了照。原来，切屑的多少是衡量工厂机械加工技术水平的一个重要依据。那些家伙所以这样干，分明是想捞点稻草，说我们的技术落后。工人同志看在眼里，记在心里，默念着毛主席的伟大教导：“中国人民有志气，有能力，一定要在不远的将来，赶上和超过世界先进水平。”他们下定决心：一定要为祖国争光，一定要为工人阶级争气！
    一九六五年，车间的工人、工人出身的技术员和革命干部，组成了“三结合”攻关小组，着手试制纵向轧制机。他们从调查研究着手，听取工人的意见，到兄弟厂去学习，得到了很大的启发。他们边设计，边研究，边制造。为了设计一个复杂的头架，工人们先用硬板纸剪，再用泥捏出模型来，等到有了大致的轮廓以后，才绘图制造。这时，走资派和资产阶级
  “专家”却明里暗里大泼冷水，百般刁难，结果使这个研究项目搞了一两年始终不能投入生产。
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，无产阶级革命派夺了党内一小撮走资派窃踞的大权，把资产阶级反动技术“权威”赶下了台，纵向轧制小组的同志个个精神振奋，斗志昂扬。新生的革命委员会成立后，更是不断用毛泽东思想武装小组成员，使他们在困难面前不气馁。
    在兄弟单位协助下，自动控制机构很快装成了。他们在实践中摸索经验，一步一个脚印，在无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的凯歌声中，终于成功地完成了试制任务，并且很快正式投入了生产。用这一纵向轧制机生产钻头，比原来切削加工提高效率二十多倍，节约贵重钢材百分之三十左右，钻头使用寿命延长百分之五十。
