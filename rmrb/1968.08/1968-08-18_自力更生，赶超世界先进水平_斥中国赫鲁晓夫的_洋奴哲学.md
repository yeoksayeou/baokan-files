The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Chinese people have the spirit and the ability to catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level in the not-too-distant future." Chairman Mao's great teachings are becoming a reality and will increasingly demonstrate their immense power. Atomic bombs, which foreigners have, we have too; artificial fully synthetic crystalline insulin, which foreigners cannot produce, we have produced; the world's first synthetic benzene plant, which foreigners do not have, we have too. We will also catch up with and surpass the international advanced level in various other areas.

However, the Chinese Khrushchev has completely bowed down to imperialism and revisionism, advocating the reactionary view that "the Chinese cannot do it, but foreigners can." A small clique of capitalist roaders within our factory, following the orders of their master, have elevated a so-called "authority" who worships "foreign theories" and "foreign technologies" as sacred scriptures, giving him control over our factory's technical leadership. This so-called "authority" boasts of being a "Vinylon expert" who has "been to Japan." In technical matters, he always talks about how Japan does things, but he cannot solve the problems that arise in production. He is a living example of the "slave philosophy" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev.

When the laboratory needed paper frames for the physical inspection of Vinylon short fibers, the quantity required was large, and previously, they were manually carved one by one, which did not guarantee quality. The female workers in the lab repeatedly asked this capitalist technical "authority" to help design a machine. He always said: "Making paper frames, Japan also does it by hand. If it could be made by machine at any time, they would have done it long ago." The female workers were so angry they could hardly breathe.

Chairman Mao says: "The most intelligent and most talented are those with the most practical experience." The female workers told this story to a level-three fitter from a poor peasant background. The worker angrily said: "This fellow only has foreigners in his eyes! He always uses foreigners to intimidate us. Although Japan's Vinylon production is a step ahead of ours, we have Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao is backing us up. We will definitely leave them behind. Problems they cannot solve, we can solve, and we definitely will solve them." With the help of this fitter, the female workers in the lab successfully developed a machine to make paper frames in just one week, increasing work efficiency by several times.

The hot treatment shrinkage machine in the Vinylon workshop was proven to have design flaws through practice. The operators demanded improvements. This technical "authority," who had been to capitalist countries and gilded himself, said: "Do not make any changes, respect the original Japanese design." He even questioned the workers: "What is your theoretical basis? You have only seen Vinylon for a few days?" The workers sternly refuted him: "Our theoretical basis is the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, it is practice—cognition—practice—cognition again, it is our unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, unlimited loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We do not seek fame or personal gain. We dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act." Through the workers' struggle, the design of this machine was finally modified.

In these facts, not only was the slave nature of this capitalist technical "authority" exposed, but also the false facade of the Japanese Vinylon industry being the "most advanced level" that he boasted about was pierced.

After the great proletarian cultural revolution, this capitalist "authority" was ousted. Armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, we fear neither heaven nor earth, nor ghosts or foreigners, and have solved many production problems that foreigners have not solved.

Recently, Chairman Mao profoundly pointed out: "We must let proletarian politics take command and follow the path of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory in training technical personnel from among the workers." This is also a powerful critique of the "slave philosophy" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents. We will not let down Chairman Mao's earnest expectations, thoroughly smash the "slave philosophy," and advance courageously in Vinylon production, climbing peaks that no one has climbed before.

### 自力更生，赶超世界先进水平——斥中国赫鲁晓夫的“洋奴哲学”

    自力更生，赶超世界先进水平
    ——斥中国赫鲁晓夫的“洋奴哲学”
    北京维尼纶厂维尼纶车间工人　宋震远
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“中国人民有志气，有能力，一定要在不远的将来，赶上和超过世界先进水平。”毛主席的伟大教导，正在变成现实，并且将越来越显示出无比的威力。原子弹外国有，我们有了；人工全合成结晶胰岛素，外国人搞不出来，我们搞出来了；国际上第一个合成苯车间，外国没有，我们也有了……。我们还将在各个方面赶上和超过国际先进水平。
    可是中国赫鲁晓夫却完全拜倒在帝国主义、修正主义的脚下，宣扬“中国人不行”，“外国人才行”的反动论调。我厂党内的一小撮走资派，秉承其主子的旨意，把一个奉“洋理论”、“洋技术”为金科玉律的资产阶级“权威”捧上了天，让他控制我厂技术领导大权。这个所谓“权威”成天标榜自己是“去过日本”的“维尼纶专家”。他在技术上张口闭口都是日本如何如何，可就是解决不了生产中发生的问题，完全是中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“洋奴哲学”的一个活标本。
    化验室作维尼纶短纤维物理检验时，需要一种纸框，这种纸框用量大，过去都是用手工一刀刀地去刻，质量又不容易保证。实验女工几次找到这个资产阶级的技术“权威”，要他帮助设计一台机器。他每次都说：“制做纸框，日本也是手工，要能用机器随时制作，人家早就用了。”女工们听到后，肺都气炸了。
    毛主席说：“最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”女工们把这个事告诉了贫农出身的三级钳工。这个工人气愤地说：“这个家伙眼里就只有洋人！老是拿洋人来吓唬我们，日本制造维尼纶虽然是比我们先走了一步，但我们有毛泽东思想，有毛主席给我们撑腰，我们一定能把他们甩在后面，他们没有解决的问题我们可以解决，也一定能解决。”化验室的女工在这位钳工的帮助下，只用一个星期的时间，就试制成功一台制造纸框的机器，工作效率提高了几十倍。
    维尼纶车间的热处理卷缩机，实践证明设计的不合理。操作工人要求改进。这个曾到过资本主义国家镀过金的技术“权威”，却说什么“不许改动，尊重日本原设计”，他还质问工人：“你有什么理论根据？你们看到维尼纶才几天？”工人们严厉驳斥了他：“我们的理论根据就是战无不胜的毛泽东思想，就是实践——认识——再实践——再认识，就是无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，不为名，不为利，敢想，敢说，敢闯。”经过工人们的斗争，终于修改了这台机器的设计。
    在这些事实面前，不但暴露出这个资产阶级技术“权威”的洋奴本相，而且也戳穿了他所吹嘘的日本维尼纶工业是“最先进水平”的画皮。
    经过轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命运动的洗礼，这个资产阶级“权威”被赶下了台。我们以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，天不怕，地不怕，鬼神不怕，洋人不怕，解决了许多外国人没有解决的生产问题。
    最近，毛主席深刻地指出：“要无产阶级政治挂帅，走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路。”这同时也是对中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人鼓吹的“洋奴哲学”的最有力的批判。我们决不辜负毛主席的殷切期望，大破“洋奴哲学”，在维尼纶生产上奋勇前进，攀登前人没有攀登过的顶峰。
