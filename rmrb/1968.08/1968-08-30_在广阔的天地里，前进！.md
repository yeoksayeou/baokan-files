We, the most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao, recently pointed out deeply: "We must select students from workers and peasants who have practical experience, let them study in schools for a few years, and then return to production practice." I heard this and couldn't help but shout loudly: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!" Chairman Mao's latest instructions once again prove that my path of going to the countryside to become a farmer is correct.

Be a "Steel Girl," Not a "Cotton Girl"

In 1962, after graduating from Beijing Liangxiang High School, I responded to Chairman Mao's great call, with a heart full of revolutionary enthusiasm, and followed Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to settle in Doujiaqiao, Baodi County.

Just arriving in the countryside, my revolutionary enthusiasm was very high! But I only had the desire to change the countryside, without the preparation to change myself. So, when I first started living in the countryside, selfish thoughts sprouted. I was born and raised in the city, and from a young age, I lived a life of being fed in the canteen and dressed in stores. When I first arrived in Doujiaqiao, it was the hottest part of summer. Working in the fields with the villagers, I either threw the hoe with a clanging sound or stuck it in the soil and couldn't pull it out. The sun burned my head, and the heat from the ground scorched my feet. I was hot and tired, my waist and legs ached. When I returned home, I still had to cook, grind grain, mend clothes, and patch things. I thought: What's the point of doing these things all day? Hearing a bit of criticism from the masses, tears circled my eyes, and I was full of grievances. At that time, I just wanted to leave Doujiaqiao and settle in a farm.

Those days, my thoughts were in turmoil. With my own confused thoughts, I opened the shining works of Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao said: "...There are also some people who are very arrogant, who, after reading a few books, think they are extraordinary, with their tails pointing to the sky. But when they encounter storms, their stance is very different from that of workers and the majority of laboring peasants. The former waver, the latter are firm, the former are ambiguous, the latter are clear." Chairman Mao's words were like a beacon, instantly illuminating my heart, making me realize for the first time the depth of my failure to completely put down the airs of an intellectual. Why can't I, a member of the nation's five hundred million peasants, labor? Why can't I, a broad mass of rural women, handle household chores? Why do I feel grieved and waver, wanting to be a deserter? This shows that in my thoughts, feelings, and life, I am far from the poor and lower-middle peasants. Thinking of this, I decided to work hard on changing my worldview, to undergo a thorough transformation, actively approach the poor and lower-middle peasants, humbly learn from them, and resolutely unite with them.

I made up my mind to temper myself, actively participate in production labor, fearing neither hardship nor fatigue. When pulling wheat, my hands were covered with seven or eight large blisters, which burst open, revealing fresh red flesh. When I grabbed the wheat again, the pain in my hands was like being pricked by needles. The villagers cared for me and advised me to rest. I thought of Chairman Mao's teachings: "You want the masses to understand you, you want to blend in with the masses, you must make a decision and undergo long-term, even painful, tempering." I also thought about how the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants work like this year after year. Why can't I do it? So, I gritted my teeth and started pulling again. The villagers saw me working so hard and called me the "Iron Girl." This was naturally the encouragement of the poor and lower-middle peasants. But I thought, I must be alert to being a "Cotton Girl" in my thoughts. If I don't achieve ideological transformation, I will still waver in the face of difficulties.

Once, it suddenly rained heavily, and I ran back home from the fields to avoid the rain. However, the villagers, for the sake of the collective, fearing neither wind nor rain, were busy outside salvaging bricks. This incident deeply moved me, and I also started working with everyone. No matter how the rain soaked our clothes, we were all fighting intensely, stacking the bricks neatly and covering them tightly. I felt both happy and ashamed. Usually, I also talked about loving the collective, but in reality, I was not as concerned about the collective as the poor and lower-middle peasants. The lofty qualities of the poor and lower-middle peasants' love for the collective gave me a vivid lesson.

During labor, no matter if the villagers were in the mud, water, or soil, they feared neither dirt nor fatigue. I watched and learned from them, always taking them as my example. Once, while repairing a house, I and a few villagers mixed mud together, barefoot, with our pants rolled up, into the mud pit. Mud and sweat covered our heads and faces, and we didn't even have time to wipe them off. But at that moment, I felt my thoughts were cleaner than ever. I truly understood that what Chairman Mao said, "The cleanest are still the workers and peasants, even though their hands are black and their feet have cow dung, they are still cleaner than the bourgeoisie and petty-bourgeois intellectuals," is an absolute truth.

Through labor, my feelings with the poor and lower-middle peasants deepened, and my thoughts of wholeheartedly serving the people became more firm. I often helped the poor and lower-middle peasants with the youth, carrying water, cooking, taking care of children, and grinding grain. If someone's house was damaged, we used our rest time to help repair it; if someone was sick, we visited more frequently. There was an elderly person in the Five Guarantees who fell ill, and we helped him three times a day with meals, cleaning the house, calling the doctor, buying medicine, washing clothes, and bedding. The villagers were very moved.

Facing the wind and rain, fearing no sharp struggles

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We Communist Party members should face the wind and rain, see the world; this wind and rain is the great storm of the masses' struggle, and this world is the great world of the masses' struggle." In these years of mass struggle, I have advanced with the masses.

When I first went to the countryside, I had a wrong idea, thinking that my class consciousness was higher than that of the peasants. In reality, it was not the case. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants not only worked wholeheartedly for the collective in production but were also the vanguard and pioneers of class struggle. In the socialist education movement in the countryside, I personally heard the poor and lower-middle peasants recalling bitterness and sweetness, telling village history and family history, exposing the crimes of class enemies, and bravely exposing bad people and bad deeds, resolutely fighting against old ideas and old forces. They hated class enemies the most and loved Chairman Mao the most, and they were my best teachers. I organized the youth to compile village and family histories, visiting several elderly poor peasants. An over eighty-year-old poor peasant grandmother, after telling her family history, said to us: "Don't look at how the landlords and rich peasants appear to be honest and hardworking, their hearts are evil! They are always plotting to change the sky." Look! How clear the poor and lower-middle peasants' class standpoint is, how firm their class stance is!

Facts educated me. I gradually understood that the poor and lower-middle peasants are the "revolutionary vanguard," and "without the poor peasants, there would be no revolution." The vivid class education strengthened my class struggle awareness and raised my awareness of the two-line struggle. At the struggle meeting against the enemy, I stood on the side of the poor and lower-middle peasants for the first time in my life and fought resolutely against the class enemy! I exposed the enemy's plot of using yellow literature to corrupt the youth and giving small favors to win over cadres.

To compete with the class enemy for the peasants and the youth, and to implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line on literature and art, I decided to occupy the rural battlefield with revolutionary literature and art. With the help of many educated youth, we organized a propaganda team, going deep into the fields and farmlands, reading newspapers to the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, and guiding them to study Chairman Mao's works. We also wrote and performed our own literary and artistic performances, which the masses loved very much. Later, more and more youth participated in literary and artistic activities, and we established a chorus and an art troupe. In this way, every day before work, before meetings, and during the villagers' rest time, there were our revolutionary literary and artistic activities.

Our village has fifty percent of its collective arable land as saline-alkali land. "Spring salt like frost, autumn watery." The seeds are preserved but not harvested, and usually only sixty or seventy pounds of grain are harvested. What to do? I thought, fighting against nature is a mass struggle, and we must mobilize the power of the masses. So, I discussed with everyone and established a scientific and technological small group consisting of old peasants, cadres, and youth, determined to treat the saline-alkali land. The class enemy saw this and hated it to death, engaging in sabotage activities. Some people with conservative thoughts also joined in, saying, "After eating two full meals, we don't know what to do next. Planting corn in saline-alkali land is like a blind man lighting a lamp in vain." I felt: This is not only about treating saline-alkali land but also a class struggle. To change the production situation, we must study Chairman Mao's works and transform people's thoughts. We repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's "Three Articles," took Dazhai as an example, carried forward the spirit of "Moving Mountains," and fought for three years. On the first barren saline-alkali land in Nanwa, we harvested corn with a yield of five hundred pounds per mu. The villagers said: "Always remember to study 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong,' clear mind and firm will, the poor and lower-middle peasants hold the seal, carrying a thousand miles without changing shoulders."

I increasingly realized that only in the great storms and waves of mass struggle can one cultivate successors of the proletarian revolution. In his infamous black book "On Cultivation," Liu Shaoqi spread the reactionary fallacy of "a scholar does not need to leave home to know the world," attempting to drag us away from the workers and peasants, away from revolutionary practice, away from the fiery mass struggle, and into the dead-end of "cultivation" behind closed doors. We will never agree to this.

Forging a red heart, forever unchanging

I took one step at a time on the road of integrating with the workers and peasants, but the class enemy saw me as a thorn in their eye and a bone in their throat, trying every means to drive me away and crush me.

In 1964, the counter-revolutionary Zhou Yang personally came to Doujiaqiao and spread poison, telling me to "write novels" and realize my childhood dream of becoming a writer, attempting to lure me into the water with fame and wealth. He asked me: "Have you written any novels?" I said: "No." He then asked: "Have you considered it? How to realize the dream of becoming a writer after going to the countryside?" At that time, I felt very surprised and told him: "I have not considered it. Since the day I went to the countryside, I have not wanted to be a writer." Seeing that I did not fall into his trap, he angrily said: "You were sent down, not to throw away your knowledge." He also said: "Your integration with the workers and peasants and your practical experience give you capital. Writing about your personal experiences would be a good novel!" At that time, I thought, the education I received in school instilled in me the bourgeois idea of pursuing fame and wealth, engaging in personal struggle, forgetting class and class struggle, forgetting the dictatorship of the proletariat, and sliding into the swamp of revisionism, becoming a successor of the bourgeoisie. I must be loyal to Chairman Mao, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and be a successor of the proletarian revolutionary cause. So, I firmly refused him. I said: "Now I understand what an ideal is. Being a new-style peasant and serving the people for life is my only ideal!"

In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we Red Guards swept away the "Four Olds" and swept away the ghosts and monsters, and fought a head-on battle against the capitalist roaders, firmly implementing and defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They, in order to confuse their way through, used continuing genealogies and pulling families, spreading rumors and slanders, deceiving some of the masses, inciting the masses to fight the masses, and manipulating the masses who did not know the truth to surround me with big-character posters, saying that I was "harboring evil intentions," falsely coming to the countryside, and was "cultivated by Zhou Yang and Peng Zhen," also saying that I was a "backstage capitalist roader." They spread rumors and shifted the direction of the struggle, many times inciting the masses to seize and struggle against me.

Once, I participated in the Tianjin region's lecture meeting on studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in my county, and the class enemy manipulated some uninformed masses to post big-character posters about me everywhere in the county city and distribute leaflets. When I was speaking at the meeting, they also incited the masses to cause trouble in the venue, not letting me speak. I was really troubled and didn't want to speak anymore. But then I thought of Chairman Mao's teaching: "Being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing." Today, I am promoting Mao Zedong Thought, and they are opposing it. Can I compromise? Never! They are opposing Mao Zedong Thought, and they are our enemies. I raised high the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," shouting: "My head can be cut off, my blood can flow, but Mao Zedong Thought cannot be abandoned!" With the support of the broad revolutionary masses, I exposed the class enemy's plot on the spot and repelled their attack.

Looking back at my growth process, which step did not have the guidance of Chairman Mao? Which journey did not condense his blood? I felt as if I had returned to Chairman Mao's side, my heart was moved, and tears flowed down. I silently swore to Chairman Mao: Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! You support us, and we will definitely make you proud. For defending your great thoughts, defending your revolutionary line, defending the iron fortress of socialism, even if I am torn to pieces, I am willing.

Several years of rural struggle life have tempered me, and I deeply feel: going to the mountains and countryside is the bright path pointed out by Chairman Mao. This is the necessary path for the revolutionary and laboring transformation of us educated youth. We must personally change the poor and blank face of our motherland. We must personally participate in the battle to bury the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries. I am determined to hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought and advance firmly on the revolutionary road of integrating with the workers and peasants!

    在广阔的天地里，前进！
    河北省宝坻县革命委员会常委、窦家桥大队下乡知识青年　侯隽
    我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，最近深刻地指出：“要从有实践经验的工人农民中间选拔学生，到学校学几年以后，又回到生产实践中去。”我听了情不自禁连声高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”毛主席的最新指示，又一次证明，我下乡当农民的路走对了。
    做“铁姑娘”，不做“棉花姑娘”
    一九六二年，我在北京良乡中学高中毕业后，响应毛主席的伟大号召，怀着满腔的革命热情，遵循毛主席的革命路线，到宝坻县窦家桥落了户。
    刚刚到农村，我的革命热情可高哩！可是，我光有改造农村的愿望，没有改造自己的思想准备。所以，一开始过农村生活，私心杂念就发了芽。我生在城市，长在城市，从小就过着吃饭进食堂，穿衣进商店的娇生惯养的生活。初到窦家桥，正是三伏天，和社员们一块锄地，不是把锄摔得叮当响，就是插进土里拉不动。头上太阳晒，脚下热气烤，又热又累，腰痠腿疼。回家还得自己烧火做饭、推碾捣磨、缝缝补补。我心想：整天干这些有啥意思？听到群众的一点批评，眼泪围着眼圈转，满肚子委屈。那时我一心想离开窦家桥，到农场去安家落户。
    那些日子，我思想斗争很激烈。带着自己的活思想，我打开金光闪闪的毛主席著作，毛主席说：“……还有一些人很骄傲，读了几句书，自以为了不起，尾巴翘到天上去了，可是一遇风浪，他们的立场，比起工人和大多数劳动农民来，就显得大不相同。前者动摇，后者坚定，前者暧昧，后者明朗。”毛主席的宝书象明灯，一下子照亮了我的心，使我第一次比较深刻地认识到自己还没有完全放下知识分子的架子。全国五亿农民谁个不劳动？广大农村妇女那个没有家务？为什么他们都能埋头苦干，任劳任怨，而我就委屈、动摇，想当逃兵？这说明我在思想上、感情上、生活上和贫下中农有很大距离。想到这些，我决心在改造世界观上下硬功夫，来一个脱胎换骨的改造，积极主动接近贫下中农，虚心向他们学习，决心同贫下中农结合在一起。
    我下定决心磨炼自己，积极参加生产劳动，不怕苦，不怕累。拔麦子时，手上磨了七、八个大血泡，泡破了，露出鲜红的嫩肉。再一抓麦子，手上的伤口象针扎一样疼。社员们爱护我，劝我休息。我想起毛主席的教导：“你要群众了解你，你要和群众打成一片，就得下决心，经过长期的甚至是痛苦的磨练。”又想想广大贫下中农社员成年累月这样干，我为啥干不了。于是，我咬咬牙又拔起来。社员们看我这样下劲干，都叫我“铁姑娘”。这自然是贫下中农对我的鼓励。可是，我想，我一定要警惕思想上象个“棉花姑娘”。要不实现思想革命化，在困难面前还会软下来的。
    有一次，突然下起大雨，我从地里跑回家避雨。可是，社员们为了集体，不怕风吹雨淋，在外面忙着抢土坯。这事，深深感动了我，我也就和大家一块干起来。任凭雨浇透了衣服，一个个都在紧张地战斗着，把土坯垛码齐，盖严了。我心中又高兴又惭愧。平日自己也口口声声热爱集体，可实际上却不象贫下中农那样关心集体。贫下中农热爱集体的崇高品质，给我上了生动的一课。
    劳动时，社员们不管在泥里、水里、土里，都不怕脏，不怕累，我看在眼里，记在心上，处处以他们为榜样，向他们学习。有一次，在修理房屋时，我和几个社员一起和泥，光着脚丫子，挽起裤腿，下到泥坑里，泥水、汗水弄得满头、满脸，也顾不得擦一把。可我觉得这时候的思想，却比什么时候都干净。我真正体会到毛主席说的“最干净的还是工人农民，尽管他们手是黑的，脚上有牛屎，还是比资产阶级和小资产阶级知识分子都干净”，是千真万确的真理。
    在劳动中，我和贫下中农的感情更深厚了，完全彻底为人民服务的思想更坚定了。我常常和青年们一起帮助贫下中农挑水、做饭、看孩子、推米磨面。谁家房子坏了，我们利用休息时间帮助去修；谁家有了病人，我们跑得更勤了。有个五保社员病了，我们一天三趟帮他做饭，收拾屋子，给他请医买药，洗衣洗被。社员群众看了，都很感动。
        迎着风雨，不怕尖锐斗争
    毛主席教导我们说：“我们共产党员应该经风雨，见世面；这个风雨，就是群众斗争的大风雨，这个世面，就是群众斗争的大世面。”在这几年的群众斗争中，我和群众一起前进。
    刚下乡时，我有一种错误想法，觉得自己阶级觉悟比农民高。实际上并不是这样。广大贫下中农不但在生产上一心为集体，而且是阶级斗争的尖兵和闯将。在农村社会主义教育运动中，我亲耳听见贫下中农忆苦思甜，讲村史、叙家史，控诉阶级敌人的罪恶，亲眼看见他们大胆揭发坏人、坏事，坚决地与旧思想、旧势力作斗争。他们对阶级敌人最恨，对毛主席最爱，是我最好的老师。我和青年们组织起来编写村史、家史，访问了几户老贫农。一位八十多岁的贫农老大娘讲完她的家史后对我们说：“别看那地主、富农表面上老实巴交的，心可毒呢！他们时刻想变天。”看！贫下中农阶级观点多么明确，阶级立场多么坚定！
    事实教育了我。我逐步懂得了贫下中农是“革命先锋”，“没有贫农，便没有革命”的道理。生动的阶级教育，使我加强了阶级斗争观念，提高了两条路线斗争觉悟。在对敌斗争的大会上，我生平第一次站在贫下中农立场上，向阶级敌人进行坚决的斗争！我揭发阶级敌人利用黄色读物毒害青年，施些小恩小惠拉拢干部的阴谋。
    为了与阶级敌人争夺农民，争夺青年，贯彻毛主席的革命文艺路线，我决心用革命文艺占领农村阵地。在广大知识青年的协助下，我们组织了宣传队，深入到田间、地头，给广大贫下中农读报，辅导他们学习毛主席著作。我们还自编自演文艺节目，群众十分爱看。后来，参加文艺活动的青年越来越多，我们又成立了歌咏队和文艺队。这样一来，每天上工前、开会前和社员休息时间，都有我们的革命文艺活动。
    我们村盐碱地占全村集体耕地的百分之五十。“春季碱如霜，秋季水汪汪”。保种不保收，通常年景只收六、七十斤粮。怎么办呢？我想，同自然作斗争，是一场群众斗争，必须把群众的力量动员起来。于是，我和大家商量，建立了老农、干部、青年三结合的科学技术小组，下定决心根治盐碱。阶级敌人看到这些，恨得要死，大搞破坏活动。一些有保守思想的人也跟着瞎说“刚吃两天饱饭，又不知干啥好了，碱地里种棒子，这是瞎子点灯白费蜡。”我觉得：这不仅仅是根治盐碱的问题，而且是一场阶级斗争。要改变生产面貌，就要学习毛主席著作，改造人们的思想。我们反复学习毛主席著作“老三篇”，以大寨为榜样，发扬“愚公移山”的精神，苦战三年，在南洼荒碱地上第一次收获了亩产五百斤的玉米。社员们说：“时刻不忘学‘毛选’，心明眼亮意志坚，贫下中农掌大印，负重千里不换肩。”
    我越来越深刻地认识到，只有在群众斗争的大风大浪里，才能培养出无产阶级红色接班人。中国赫鲁晓夫在他那臭名昭著的黑《修养》中，极力散布“秀才不出门，便知天下事”的反动谬论，妄想把我们拉向脱离工农，脱离革命实践，脱离火热的群众斗争，闭门“修养”的绝路，我们一万个不答应。
        铸就红心，一生永不褪色
    我一步一个脚印地踏着与工农结合的道路前进，阶级敌人却把我当成眼中钉肉中刺，千方百计想把我挤走、压倒。
    一九六四年，反革命分子周扬亲自跑到窦家桥大放其毒，叫我“写小说”，实现幼时所谓“当作家的理想”，妄图用名利拉我下水。他问我：“写小说没有？”我说：“没有。”他又问：“你考虑过没有？下乡成为文学家的理想怎么实现？”当时我感到很突然，就对他说：“没有考虑过，从下乡那天起，我就不想当文学家了。”他见我没有上套，就气呼呼地说：“把你们放下来，不是让你们把知识扔了。”还说：“你与工农结合，又经过了实践，有资本。把你的亲身经历写一写，就是一本好小说嘛！”当时我想，过去学校的教育给我灌输了追求名利的资产阶级思想，搞个人奋斗，就会忘记阶级和阶级斗争，就会忘记无产阶级专政，就会滑进修正主义的泥坑，成为资产阶级接班人。我一定要忠于毛主席，听毛主席的话，要当无产阶级革命事业的接班人。于是，我就坚决给他顶了回去。我说：“现在我才懂得了什么是理想，做一个新式农民，为人民服务一辈子，就是我唯一的理想！”
    在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，我们红卫兵横扫了“四旧”，横扫了牛鬼蛇神，并向走资派进行了针锋相对的斗争，坚决执行、捍卫毛主席的革命路线。他们为了蒙混过关，利用续家谱、拉家族，造谣诽谤，蒙蔽一部分群众，挑动群众斗群众，并操纵不明真相的群众用大字报围攻我，说我是“心怀鬼胎”，假意到农村来的，是“周扬和彭真培养”的，还说我是“幕后走资派”。他们散布流言蜚语，转移斗争大方向，曾多次煽动群众揪斗我。
    有一次，我参加天津地区在我县召开的活学活用毛泽东思想讲用会，阶级敌人操纵一些不明真相的群众在县城里到处贴我的大字报，散发传单。我在大会上发言时，他们又煽动群众在会场上捣乱，不让我讲。我心里真烦，不想讲了。可又想起毛主席的“被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事”的教导。今天，我宣传毛泽东思想，他们反对，我能妥协吗？决不能！他们反对毛泽东思想，就是我们的敌人。我高举起红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，高呼：“头可断，血可流，毛泽东思想不能丢！”在广大革命群众的支持下，我当场揭发了阶级敌人的阴谋活动，打退了他们的进攻。
    回顾我成长的历程，那一步没有毛主席他老人家的指引？那一程不凝结着他老人家的心血？我仿佛又回到了毛主席身边，心里激动，眼泪都流下来了。我暗暗向毛主席宣誓：毛主席啊，毛主席！您给我们撑腰，我们一定给您争气，为了捍卫您的伟大思想，捍卫您的革命路线，捍卫社会主义铁打江山，就是粉身碎骨我也心甘情愿。
    几年的农村战斗生活锻炼了我，我深深感到：上山下乡是毛主席给我们指出的光明大道，这是我们知识青年革命化，劳动化的必由之路。我们要亲手改变祖国一穷二白的面貌，我们要亲身参加埋葬帝、修、反的战斗。我决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在与工农结合的革命大道上坚定不移向前进！
