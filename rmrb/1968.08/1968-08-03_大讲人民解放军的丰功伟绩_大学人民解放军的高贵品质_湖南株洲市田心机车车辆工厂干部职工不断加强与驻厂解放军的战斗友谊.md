The revolutionary committee of Tianxin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory in Zhuozhou City, Hunan Province, and the broad revolutionary masses always remember the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions on "supporting the army and loving the people" and "believing in and relying on the People's Liberation Army." They closely unite, fight, and win together with the PLA's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed in the factory. They seize every opportunity to extol the great achievements of the People's Liberation Army, learn from the noble qualities of the PLA's unconditional loyalty to Chairman Mao, and strongly support and assist the PLA in carrying out various tasks. They continuously consolidate and develop the revolutionary combat camaraderie between the military and the people, which is as close as flesh and blood and as inseparable as fish and water. This has powerfully ensured the smooth progress of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and brought about a thriving scene of revolution and production.

In March last year, when the revolutionary masses of this factory were being brutally suppressed and persecuted by the bourgeois reactionary line at a critical moment, the PLA's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team entered the factory. According to the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction that "the People's Liberation Army should support the broad leftist masses," they resolutely and firmly supported the revolutionary actions of the proletarian revolutionary masses, quickly foiling the plot of the capitalist roaders to suppress the revolutionary masses and sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They helped the proletarian revolutionary masses closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and advance victoriously along Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. In the fierce class struggle, the army loves the people, and the people support the army, forging a deep revolutionary combat camaraderie between the military and the people.

Extolling the PLA's glorious revolutionary traditions and great achievements

The revolutionary committee and revolutionary masses of this factory often use "supporting the army and loving the people" reports, broadcasts, and artistic performances to vigorously publicize the great merits of the People's Liberation Army, especially their great role in safeguarding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the "three supports and two militaries" work. The revolutionary masses love to listen to the PLA comrades recounting heroic combat stories that shine with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, and often invite them to give reports.

Once, a PLA comrade talked about how, to firmly execute Chairman Mao's operational directives for the Liaoshen Campaign, they fought a bloody battle in the Newlitun Blocking Battle. Everyone was deeply moved after hearing this. They recalled how, after the PLA comrades entered the factory, they fearlessly braved the stormy waves to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, support the proletarian revolutionary masses, and shield the besieged revolutionary masses with their own bodies, and how they transfused their own blood to the injured class brothers. All these memories boiled down to one sentence: "Father and mother are dear, but Chairman Mao is dearer; in all respects, the People's Liberation Army is the best." They tried every means to express their love for the PLA. A representative from a workshop who returned from a provincial meeting obtained two meaningful Mao badges. They repeatedly discussed who should wear these two most meaningful Mao badges and finally unanimously decided to give them to two comrades from the PLA's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed in the factory.

The heroic model deeds of the PLA's unconditional loyalty to Chairman Mao powerfully inspired and encouraged the revolutionary masses of this factory to fight against the capitalist roaders. The original party branch secretary of the factory's affiliated hospital was a worker-turned cadre. After hearing the PLA comrades' heroic deeds of unconditional loyalty to Chairman Mao, using their blood and lives to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, he decided to learn from the PLA comrades' heroic examples, criticize and repudiate his selfishness, and accelerate his ideological revolution. The masses were satisfied with him and quickly approved his participation in the revolutionary three-in-one leadership cadre.

Learning from the PLA's noble qualities of unconditional loyalty to Chairman Mao

The PLA brought their work style of closely following the great leader Chairman Mao from above and relying on the broad revolutionary masses from below into the factory. The factory revolutionary committee also took the PLA as an example, firmly grasping both ends, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and firmly grasping the direction of the struggle. Whenever Chairman Mao issued new instructions or the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin issued battle orders, they immediately organized study and implementation. Once, the factory revolutionary committee received an important notice from the central authorities at around nine o'clock in the evening and, learning from the PLA's swift and decisive style, convened a full factory staff meeting to convey the notice half an hour later. The masses were very satisfied with this. Another time, some comrades from the PLA's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team had to go to new battle stations, and the factory's revolutionary masses were very reluctant to see them go. They decided to accompany these PLA comrades to visit Shaoshan, the place where the red sun rises, but because the train was crowded, these PLA comrades and some members of the factory revolutionary committee could not board the train with the masses. At this time, someone suggested sending a car to take them, but the PLA comrades firmly refused, insisting on taking the next train. The PLA's strict self-discipline, frugal and plain living, and excellent style of closely connecting with the masses greatly educated the members of the revolutionary committee. After returning, they studied Chairman Mao's instructions on hard struggle and connecting with the masses, took the PLA as an example, examined their own shortcomings in connecting with the masses, relying on the masses, and implementing the mass line, and made decisions to improve their leadership style and streamline the bureaucracy. Afterwards, the relationship between the cadres and the masses became even closer. Most members of the revolutionary committee lived, worked, and struggled against selfishness and repudiated revisionism with the masses. Wherever there were problems, they went there to "work" and solved the problems on the spot.

The revolutionary committee and revolutionary masses of this factory also paid attention to learning from the PLA's experience of emphasizing proletarian politics, adhering to the four firsts, and firmly grasping class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. Once, some PLA comrades pointed out the class struggle and the struggle between the two lines to a few comrades who had previously taken the wrong side, and the effect was very good. Some members of the factory revolutionary committee also learned from the PLA comrades' experience and, together with the PLA comrades, went down to various workshops and teams to give reports on the struggle between the two lines, linking their own experiences and feelings. This effectively raised the awareness of a part of the comrades in class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. A worker who had previously taken the wrong side wrote a letter to the comrades of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed in the factory late at night after listening to the report, expressing his determination to stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

After the establishment of the revolutionary committee, the members had great aspirations to do well in both revolution and production, but due to lack of experience, they unconsciously got bogged down in trivial matters. The class enemies then took the opportunity to cause trouble, resulting in some losses in both revolution and production. Later, with the help of the stationed PLA, they studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "political work being the lifeline of all economic work" and related class struggle, as well as the army's experience of adhering to the four firsts and emphasizing proletarian politics. They concentrated their efforts on class struggle, severely striking down the sabotage activities of a small handful of class enemies, and greatly raising the masses' awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. Since March, production has been rising month by month, reaching the highest level since the factory's establishment in June. They deeply felt that "when people listen to Chairman Mao's words, machines listen to people's words; this is an absolute truth."

Strongly supporting and assisting the PLA in carrying out various tasks

The revolutionary committee and revolutionary masses of this factory regarded supporting and assisting the PLA in carrying out work and fighting side by side with the PLA as their duty, their glorious political responsibility, and a practical action to consolidate and strengthen the proletarian dictatorship. After April this year, most of the comrades from the PLA's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed in the factory were transferred due to revolutionary needs, leaving a few comrades to be responsible for several units. In the face of many tasks and few people, some comrades in the propaganda team worked day and night to get the work done. The revolutionary masses saw this in their hearts and felt the pain. Some workers then took the initiative to suggest to the propaganda team comrades that they should focus on the work of the factory and various workshop revolutionary committees, and do a good job in the ideological and organizational construction of the leading cadres. The propaganda team comrades felt that this suggestion was very good, and later they focused on helping the various levels of revolutionary committees to do a good job in ideological and organizational construction and grasp the root. In this way, the propaganda team comrades were not as busy as before, and the role of the various levels of revolutionary committees was also better played. The PLA comrades deeply felt that "the masses are the real heroes, and we can only humbly learn from the masses and be the masses' little students to successfully carry out the work."

The revolutionary masses have great trust and care for the PLA comrades and often actively report the situation to the PLA comrades. When the propaganda team comrades sometimes have shortcomings, they always point them out in a timely manner with a caring attitude, either individually or in a meeting. The PLA comrades also humbly listen to the masses' opinions and immediately correct their shortcomings once they find any. The masses said, "The PLA comrades have the highest standards for themselves and correct their shortcomings the fastest."

The revolutionary masses of this factory highly value maintaining military-civilian unity. Whenever class enemies direct their spears at the People's Liberation Army and engage in slander, they immediately expose, criticize, and fight back, and seriously investigate and deal with the matter. Once, they discovered a malicious slogan attacking the People's Liberation Army and immediately launched an investigation and counterattack, leaving the culprit no place to hide.

"When the military and the people unite as one, who in the world can be their enemy?" Through more than two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionary masses of Tianxin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory have deeply felt that Chairman Mao's great instruction on "supporting the army and loving the people" has extremely profound strategic significance. They are determined to forever unite, fight, and win together with the People's Liberation Army, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

　　大讲人民解放军的丰功伟绩
　　大学人民解放军的高贵品质
　　湖南株洲市田心机车车辆工厂干部职工不断加强与驻厂解放军的战斗友谊
    湖南省株洲市田心机车车辆工厂革委会和广大革命群众，时刻牢记伟大领袖毛主席“拥军爱民”、“相信和依靠人民解放军”的教导，紧紧地和驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队团结、战斗、胜利在一起，利用各种机会，大讲人民解放军的丰功伟绩，大学人民解放军无限忠于毛主席的高贵品质，大力支持和帮助人民解放军开展各项工作，不断巩固和发展军民之间血肉相连、鱼水相依的革命战斗情谊，有力地保证了无产阶级文化大革命的胜利进行，使革命和生产出现了一派欣欣向荣的景象。
    去年三月，正当这个厂的无产阶级革命派受到资产阶级反动路线残酷镇压和迫害的关键时刻，解放军毛泽东思想宣传队进入了这个工厂。他们根据伟大领袖毛主席“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的教导，旗帜鲜明地、坚定地支持了无产阶级革命派的革命行动，使走资派镇压革命群众、破坏无产阶级文化大革命的阴谋迅速破产。他们帮助无产阶级革命派紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，沿着毛主席的革命路线胜利前进。在激烈的阶级斗争中，军爱民，民拥军，军民之间凝结了深厚的革命战斗情谊。
    大讲解放军光荣的革命传统和建立的丰功伟绩
    这个厂的革委会和革命群众经常采取“拥军爱民”报告会、广播、文艺演出等方式，大力宣传人民解放军的伟大功勋，特别是在保卫无产阶级文化大革命和“三支”“两军”工作中所起的伟大作用。革命群众非常爱听解放军同志讲述闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的英雄战斗故事，并经常请他们作报告。
    一次，解放军同志讲到为了坚决执行毛主席关于辽沈战役的作战方针，在新立屯阻击战中，如何浴血苦战的情况，大家听后深受感动。他们联想起自己亲眼看到解放军同志入厂后，为了坚决捍卫毛主席的革命路线，支持无产阶级革命派，不怕险风恶浪，以自己的身体掩护受围攻的革命群众，以自己的鲜血输送给受伤的阶级弟兄等情况时，千言万语并成一句话：“爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲，千好万好人民解放军最好。”他们千方百计用各种方式来表达自己对解放军的热爱。有个车间的代表从省里开会回来，得到了两个很有纪念意义的毛主席像章，他们反复讨论这两个像章应交给谁佩戴最合适，最后大家一致要把这两个最有意义的毛主席像章送给驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的两个同志。
    解放军无限忠于毛主席的英雄模范事迹，有力地激励和鼓舞了这个厂的革命群众向走资派作斗争的战斗意志。厂附属医院原党支部书记，是个工人出身的干部，他听了解放军同志无限忠于毛主席，用鲜血和生命捍卫毛主席的革命路线的英雄事迹后，决心学习解放军同志的英雄榜样，斗私批修，加速自己的思想革命化。群众对他感到满意，很快吸收他参加了革命三结合的领导班子。
    大学解放军无限忠于毛主席的高贵品质
    解放军把上面紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，下面紧紧依靠广大革命群众的工作作风带进了工厂。厂革委会也就以解放军为榜样，紧紧抓住上下两头，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握斗争的大方向。凡是毛主席发出的最新指示，以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部发出的战斗号令，他们立即组织宣传学习，坚决照办。有一次，厂革委会在夜里九点多钟接到了中央一个重要通知，就学习解放军雷厉风行的作风，半个小时后就召开全厂职工大会进行传达，群众对此十分满意。又有一次，解放军毛泽东思想宣传队有部分同志要到新的战斗岗位上去，工厂的革命群众十分留恋，决定陪同这些解放军同志一起到红太阳升起的地方——韶山去参观，可是因为火车上人很多，这些解放军同志和厂革委会部分成员没能与群众一起上车，这时有人提出单独派汽车送去，但解放军同志坚决不肯，要坐下一次列车走。解放军处处严格要求自己，艰苦朴素、密切联系群众的优良作风，使革委会同志受到很大教育。回来后，他们就开会学习了毛主席有关艰苦奋斗、联系群众的指示，以解放军为榜样，检查了自己联系群众、依靠群众、贯彻群众路线方面存在的问题，并作出了改进领导作风、精兵简政的决定。以后，干群关系更加密切了。革委会大部分成员都和群众实行同吃、同住、同劳动、同斗私批修，那里有问题，就到那里去“办公”，就在那里解决问题。
    这个厂的革委会和革命群众还注意学习解放军突出无产阶级政治，坚持四个第一，狠抓阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的经验。一次，解放军同志针对少数过去站错队的同志的思想问题，同他们讲了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的问题，效果很好。厂革委会有些同志也学习解放军同志的经验，和解放军同志一起下到各个车间班组，联系自己的经验体会作两条路线斗争的报告，有效地提高了一部分同志的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。有一个过去站错了队的工人，听报告后连夜给驻厂毛泽东思想宣传队同志写了一封信，表示决心站到毛主席的革命路线上来。
    厂革委会成立后，革委会成员都有一股雄心壮志，要把革命和生产搞好，但由于缺乏经验，自觉不自觉地把力量陷在事务圈子里，阶级敌人就乘机捣乱，使革命和生产都受到一些损失。后来，他们在驻厂解放军的帮助下，学习了毛主席“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”和有关阶级斗争的教导，以及部队坚持四个第一，突出无产阶级政治的经验，集中力量狠抓了阶级斗争，狠狠地打击了一小撮阶级敌人的破坏活动，大大提高了群众的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。三月份以来，生产逐月上升，六月份达到了建厂以来生产的最高水平。他们深有体会地说：“人听毛主席的话，机器就听人的话，这是千真万确的真理。”
　　大力支持和帮助解放军开展各项工作
    这个厂的革委会和革命群众把支持和帮助解放军开展工作，与解放军并肩战斗，看成是自己份内的事，是自己的光荣的政治责任，是巩固和加强无产阶级专政的实际行动。今年四月以后，驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队大部分同志因革命需要调走了，留下来的同志一个人要负责好几个单位的工作。在人少事多的情况下，宣传队中有些同志为了搞好工作，整天东奔西跑，废寝忘食，革命群众看在眼里，疼在心里。有些工人就主动找宣传队同志建议，要求解放军同志着重抓好厂里和各车间革委会工作，搞好领导班子的思想革命化。宣传队的同志感到这个意见很好，以后就着重帮助各级革委会抓好思想建设和组织建设，抓好根本。这样，宣传队同志也不象以前那样忙了，各级革委会的作用也得到了更好的发挥。解放军同志深有体会地说：“群众是真正的英雄，我们只有虚心向群众学习，当群众的小学生，才能胜利地开展工作。”
    革命群众对解放军同志十分信任和关怀，经常主动地向解放军同志反映情况。对解放军宣传队的同志有时出现的缺点，总是以爱护的态度及时指出，或者是个别交谈，或者在座谈会上提出来。解放军同志也非常虚心听取群众的意见，一旦发现自己有缺点就立即改正。群众说：“解放军同志对自己要求最严，改正缺点最快。”
    这个厂的革命群众，十分重视维护军民团结。每当阶级敌人把矛头指向人民解放军，进行造谣中伤的时候，他们就立即进行揭露、批判和斗争，并严肃认真地追查处理。有一次他们发现一张恶毒攻击人民解放军的标语，就立即进行追查，展开反击，使这个坏家伙没有藏身之地。
    “军民团结如一人，试看天下谁能敌？”通过两年多来的无产阶级文化大革命，田心机车车辆工厂的无产阶级革命派更加深深感到，毛主席“拥军爱民”的伟大指示具有极其深远的战略意义。他们决心永远与人民解放军团结、战斗、胜利在一起，在毛主席革命路线的指引下，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。　本报通讯员　本报记者
