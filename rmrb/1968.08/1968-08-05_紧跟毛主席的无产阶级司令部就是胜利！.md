Victory by Following Chairman Mao's Proletarian Headquarters!
Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters

Advancing Victoriously Under the Leadership of Chairman Mao's Proletarian Headquarters!
— Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Across the Country Warmly Hail the Second Anniversary of Chairman Mao's "Bombard the Headquarters" Big-Character Poster

New China News Agency, August 4th: Amidst the triumphant songs of seizing complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses across the country warmly hail the second anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's "Bombard the Headquarters" big-character poster. Many workers, peasants, and soldiers, filled with boundless love for Chairman Mao and profound proletarian sentiments, filled with joy of victory and revolutionary enthusiasm, write articles to discuss their journey from victory to victory under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's "Bombard the Headquarters" big-character poster. They are determined to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, resolutely carry out all battle commands of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Deputy Chairman Lin, advance victoriously, and seize complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Below are a few articles written by workers, peasants, and soldiers from various places:

Two years ago today, our great leader Chairman Mao published the epoch-making "Bombard the Headquarters" big-character poster, which is the great "signal gun" to open a new era of proletarian revolution, the most profound and powerful exposure and criticism of the bourgeois headquarters led by China's Khrushchev, and the great call to arms for the proletarian revolutionary masses and hundreds of millions of revolutionary people across the country to launch a comprehensive counterattack against the bourgeoisie. It is under the brilliant guidance of the "Bombard the Headquarters" big-character poster that the proletarian class and revolutionary masses of Shanghai have recognized the main direction of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which is the bourgeois headquarters led by China's Khrushchev that has long been hidden within the proletarian dictatorship apparatus. We have raised high the great banner of Chairman Mao's "Rebellion against reactionaries is justified," fearlessly breaking through the suppression of the bourgeois reactionary line, and from every factory, from every industry, we have gathered into a mighty army of proletarian cultural revolution, launching a fierce attack on the bourgeois headquarters.

Chairman Mao teaches us: The fundamental question of revolution is the question of power. The great "January Revolution" storm has ended the rule of a handful of capitalist roaders in Shanghai, such as Chen Pi-xian and Cao Qi-qiu, who were agents of China's Khrushchev, and has seized back the party, government, financial, and cultural powers that were usurped by them, establishing the new Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee. We follow Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, ride the wind and break the waves, and have achieved one great victory after another.

Long-term struggle has made us deeply realize: Following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment is victory, following the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Deputy Chairman Lin is victory. Therefore, under any circumstances, we must wholeheartedly safeguard the proletarian revolutionary authority of the proletarian headquarters. For every new directive of Chairman Mao, for every battle command of the proletarian headquarters, we must follow closely and not deviate, execute resolutely, execute what we understand resolutely, and also execute what we do not understand temporarily resolutely, and deepen our understanding in the process of execution. At the same time, we must resolutely fight against the erroneous attitude of paying lip service but acting against the new directives of Chairman Mao and the battle commands of the proletarian headquarters; we must resolutely fight against the counter-revolutionary crimes of maliciously attacking and sabotaging Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and defying the commands of the proletarian headquarters.

"We should pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining courage, and should not seek fame like Emperor Xiang Yu." We are determined to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, to raise higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to follow the direction indicated by Chairman Mao's "Bombard the Headquarters" big-character poster, to carry forward the style of daring to fight, fearing no sacrifice, fearing no fatigue, and continuous fighting, and to advance victoriously. We must closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, grasp class struggle, carry out thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism, do a good job in cleaning up the class ranks, expose and thoroughly criticize a handful of unrepentant capitalist roaders, traitors, spies, and untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and rightists, and seize complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

　　在毛主席的无产阶级司令部领导下胜利前进！
　　——各地工农兵热烈欢呼毛主席《炮打司令部》的大字报发表两周年
    新华社四日讯　在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，全国亿万革命群众热烈欢呼伟大领袖毛主席《炮打司令部》的大字报发表两周年。许多工农兵同志怀着无限热爱毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情，怀着胜利的喜悦和满腔的革命豪情，写文章畅谈他们在伟大统帅毛主席《炮打司令部》大字报的光辉照耀下从胜利走向胜利的战斗历程，决心紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚决执行以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的一切战斗号令，乘胜前进，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。下面是各地工农兵写的几篇文章：
    两年前的今天，我们伟大统帅毛主席发表的具有划时代意义的《炮打司令部》大字报，是开辟无产阶级革命历史新纪元的伟大“号炮”，是对以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部最深刻、最有力的大揭露和大批判，是号召全国无产阶级革命派和亿万革命群众向资产阶级全面反击的伟大动员令。我们上海工人阶级和广大革命群众，正是在《炮打司令部》这张大字报的光辉照耀下，认清了无产阶级文化大革命的主攻方向，是长期隐藏在无产阶级专政机构内部的以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部。我们高举起毛主席的“对反动派造反有理”的大旗，毫不犹豫地冲破资产阶级反动路线的压制，从各个工厂，从各个行业，集结成一支浩浩荡荡的无产阶级文化革命大军，向资产阶级司令部发动了猛烈进攻。
    毛主席教导我们：革命的根本问题是政权问题。伟大的“一月革命”风暴，结束了中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部在上海的代理人陈丕显、曹荻秋等一小撮走资派的统治，把被他们篡夺了的那部分党政财文大权，夺回到了无产阶级手里，建立了新生的上海市革命委员会。我们沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，乘风破浪，取得了一个又一个的伟大胜利。
    长期的斗争实践，使我们深刻地认识到：紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署就是胜利，紧跟以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部就是胜利。因此，在任何情况下，我们必须全力维护无产阶级司令部的崇高的无产阶级革命权威。对毛主席的每一个最新指示，对无产阶级司令部的每一个战斗号令，必须紧跟不离，坚决照办，理解的要坚决执行，暂时不理解的也坚决执行，并在执行中加深理解。同时，要同那种对毛主席最新指示、对无产阶级司令部战斗号令阳奉阴违的错误态度，作坚决的斗争；要同恶意攻击、破坏毛主席的伟大战略部署，违抗无产阶级司令部号令的反革命罪行，作坚决的斗争。
      “宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”我们决心更好地活学活用毛主席著作，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，遵循毛主席《炮打司令部》大字报指引的方向，发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战的作风，乘胜前进。我们一定要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，狠抓阶级斗争，深入持久地开展革命大批判，搞好清理阶级队伍的工作，把一小撮顽固不化的走资派、叛徒、特务和没有改造好的地富反坏右分子挖出来，从政治上、思想上和理论上把他们揭深批透，斗倒斗臭，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
