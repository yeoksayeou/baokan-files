This was a day of immense excitement and joy for the impoverished herdsmen and revolutionary masses of Abaga Banner in the Xilingol League of Inner Mongolia!

At half past eight in the evening on the 25th, the latest directive from the great leader Chairman Mao arrived, and this border town with a population of only five thousand immediately became lively. The impoverished herdsmen, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary cadres who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao spread the news to each other, parading and celebrating. The streets were filled with rolling red flags and the sound of drums and gongs, awakening the grasslands that had just fallen asleep.

At nine o'clock at night, the banner revolutionary committee had already printed a large number of Chairman Mao's latest directives in Mongolian. Many impoverished herdsmen and grassroots cadres gathered here, under the bright lights, with deep class feelings, eagerly studying and discussing how to implement the latest directives. They accepted the new combat tasks assigned by the great leader Chairman Mao, their hearts filled with excitement.

At this moment, Chairman Mao's latest directives were spreading rapidly across the vast Abaga grasslands. As the comrades of the banner revolutionary committee hurriedly relayed Chairman Mao's latest directives to various communes by telephone, many production brigades had already dispatched their best riders, galloping through the dark night, swiftly delivering the great leader Chairman Mao's latest directives to the scattered yurts across the grasslands.

Chairman Mao's latest directives shone with golden light, illuminating the hearts of the impoverished herdsmen on the grasslands. Baolizhur, the director of Baiyingaole Commune, said, "At this critical moment in the struggle, Chairman Mao has once again issued an extremely important latest directive. This is the fundamental guarantee for achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." Mingsige, a member of the revolutionary committee of Baiyingtugai Commune, said, "We must act immediately, follow Chairman Mao's directives, review the struggles of the past two years, find the gaps, and achieve new victories." Sudenamu, the director of the poor association of Baiyingwula Production Brigade in Han'youla Commune, said excitedly, "We impoverished herdsmen will resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call and bravely take on the task of managing pastoral schools. Who says we impoverished herdsmen don't understand education? The bourgeois intellectuals only know how to spread bourgeois ideas. We understand proletarian education better than they do!" The herdsmen's words fully reflected their loyal hearts in following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and their thorough revolutionary spirit in determining to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end with the working class.

Chairman Mao's latest directives shone with golden light, and the revolutionary workers in factories and enterprises drew boundless strength from them. In the tractor repair factory, all the revolutionary workers spent the entire Sunday propagating Mao Zedong Thought in various units. However, when Chairman Mao's latest directives arrived, they inspired the revolutionary workers with an even higher fighting spirit. They stayed up all night, studying and creating together, preparing to go out and perform propaganda the next morning. They sang, "The red flag flies high, the crowd surges like waves, the sound of gongs and drums shakes the heavens. Chairman Mao waves his hand and gives the order, the working class marches into the schools to sweep away the filth!"

The revolutionary people and cadres on the grasslands are studying the latest directives word by word and researching how to implement them. In the morning, the propaganda teams of impoverished herdsmen and revolutionary workers set out. They went to schools and units that were still divided and in opposition, enthusiastically propagating Chairman Mao's latest directives.

The impoverished herdsmen and revolutionary masses of Abaga Banner on the grasslands are following the great leader Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment so closely!

    最新指示传遍草原
    这是内蒙古锡林郭勒盟阿巴嘎旗的贫苦牧民和革命群众经历的一个万分激动、无比兴奋的日子！
    二十五日夜晚八时半，伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示传来了，这个仅有五千人口的边疆城镇立刻沸腾起来。无限忠于毛主席的贫苦牧民、革命群众和革命干部奔走相告，游行庆祝。大道上红旗漫卷，锣鼓喧天，刚刚入睡的草原醒来了。
    夜里九点，旗革委会已经用蒙文大量翻印出毛主席的最新指示。汇聚在这里的很多贫苦牧民和基层干部，在通明的灯光下，怀着深厚的阶级感情，如饥似渴地认真学习和讨论如何落实最新指示。他们接受伟大领袖毛主席交给的新的斗争任务，心情激动不已。
    就在这个时候，毛主席的最新指示正以最快的速度，在这辽阔的阿巴嘎草原上飞传开去。当旗革委会的同志争分夺秒地用电话向各公社传达毛主席的最新指示的时候，不少社队早已派出自己的最好骑手，扬鞭跃马，四面八方，穿过沉沉的夜色，飞快向散布在草原各地的星星点点的蒙古包传送伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示。
    毛主席的最新指示发出闪闪金光，把草原贫苦牧民的心照得亮堂堂。白音高勒公社主任包利楚鲁说：“在斗争的关键时刻，毛主席他老人家又发出了极其重要的最新指示，这是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的根本保证。”白音图嘎公社革委会成员宫斯格说：“必须立即行动起来，遵照毛主席的指示，检查两年来的斗争，找出差距，夺取新的胜利。”汗依乌拉公社白音乌拉生产队贫协主任苏德那木激动地说：“我们贫苦牧民坚决响应毛主席的号召，一定勇敢地担负起管理牧区学校的任务。谁说我们贫苦牧民不懂教育？资产阶级知识分子，只会搞资产阶级一套。无产阶级教育，我们比他们懂得多！”牧民这些话，充分反映出他们紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署的赤胆忠心，充分反映出他们同工人阶级一起，决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的彻底革命精神。
    毛主席最新指示发出闪闪金光，工厂企业的革命职工从中吸取了无穷的力量。在拖拉机修理厂，全厂革命职工利用这个星期日，到好些单位宣传毛泽东思想一整天了。但是，毛主席的最新指示传来，又鼓舞了革命职工更高的战斗意志。他们通宵围在一起，边学习，边创作，准备天明出动宣传演出。他们歌唱道：“红旗飘飘飘，人群象浪潮，锣声鼓响震云霄。毛主席挥手发号召，工人阶级开进学校定把污浊扫！”
    草原上的革命人民、革命干部，正在逐字逐句学习最新指示，研究落实最新指示。上午，贫苦牧民的宣传队和革命工人宣传队都出动了。他们来到学校，走进少数还在闹分裂和对立的单位，热情宣传毛主席最新指示。
    阿巴嘎旗草原上的贫苦牧民和革命群众，对伟大领袖毛主席的伟大战略部署，就是这样紧跟不离！
