Israeli aggressors once again launched a sudden attack on Jordan. Jordanian forces retaliated, shooting down and damaging several enemy aircraft.

New China News Agency, Cairo, August 4th: The U.S. imperialist tool, Israel, brazenly used aircraft and artillery on the 4th to launch a large-scale sudden attack on Jordanian positions and towns on the east bank of the Jordan River, committing new acts of aggression. According to news from Amman, the Jordanian capital, a Jordanian military spokesman announced that starting from 1:05 PM local time on the 4th, Israeli aggressors dispatched aircraft to savage bomb areas west and south of Salat, just a few dozen kilometers from Amman, for over three hours. At the same time, Israeli aggressors stationed on the west bank of the Jordan River, which is occupied by Israel, used artillery and tank guns to shell the Karama city and the eastern regions of the Abdulla Bridge. Jordanian forces retaliated. The battle continued until 6:50 PM local time.

According to the Jordanian military spokesman, during the battle on the 4th, a U.S.-supplied Israeli fighter-bomber was hit and crashed in flames north of Jericho; several other Israeli aircraft were damaged by Jordanian anti-aircraft artillery. In addition, two Israeli tanks and two artillery emplacements were destroyed, and some soldiers were killed or wounded.

According to reports, in recent periods, Israeli military and political authorities have been continuously issuing war threats against surrounding Arab countries, especially Jordan. Shortly after launching this new act of aggression on the 4th, Israeli aggressor army chief of staff Rabin once again bluntly admitted at a press conference that Israel repeatedly launches sudden attacks on Jordan in an attempt to pressure the Jordanian government and strike at the armed struggle of Palestinian guerrillas.

　　以色列侵略军又向约旦发动突然袭击
　　约旦部队进行回击，击落击伤敌机多架
    新华社开罗四日电　美帝国主义的侵略工具以色列四日又悍然使用飞机和大炮，对约旦河东岸的约旦阵地和市镇进行大规模的突然袭击，犯下了新的侵略罪行。据来自约旦首都安曼的消息，约旦军事发言人宣布，从四日下午当地时间十三点零五分开始，以色列侵略军派遣飞机对距离安曼只有二十几公里的萨勒特以西和以南的一些地区进行了三个多小时的野蛮轰炸。与此同时，驻扎在被以色列占领的约旦河西岸的以色列侵略军，用大炮和坦克炮轰击了卡拉马市和阿卜杜拉桥以东地区。约旦部队进行了回击。战斗一直进行到当地时间十八点五十分。
    据约旦军事发言人宣布，在四日战斗中，一架由美帝国主义供应的以色列战斗轰炸机被击中，在杰里科以北着火坠落；还有几架以色列飞机被约旦高射炮部队击伤。此外，以色列侵略军的两辆坦克和两个炮兵掩体被击毁，一些士兵被打死打伤。
    据报道，最近一个时期以来，以色列军政当局一直不断地对周围阿拉伯国家、特别是约旦发出战争叫嚣。在四日发动这一新的侵略行动后不久，以色列侵略军参谋长巴勒夫就又一次直言不讳地在记者招待会上供认，以色列一再向约旦发动突然袭击，是企图对约旦当局施加压力，打击巴勒斯坦游击队的武装斗争活动。
