Hangzhou Railway Bureau Achieves Supply of Pure Soft Water for Locomotives

Under the inspiring situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary workers of the Water and Electricity Section of Hangzhou Railway Bureau, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have displayed the revolutionary spirit of daring to think, speak, and act. After more than a year of effort, they have achieved the supply of pure soft water for locomotives.

Natural water, after chemical treatment to remove alkalinity and reduce hardness, is called pure soft water. The use of pure soft water in locomotives is very beneficial for extending the boiler washing cycle, saving coal, and increasing traction power.

In the past, relevant departments had planned to import pure soft water equipment from abroad. However, the imperialist countries arrogantly claimed, "You Chinese not only cannot make this automated soft water equipment, but even if we sell it to you, you won't know how to use it." The revolutionary workers of the Water and Electricity Section were very indignant upon hearing this. They repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "The Chinese people have the spirit, have the ability, and will definitely catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level in the not-too-distant future." The workers proudly declared, "What foreigners have, we must have; what foreigners do not have, we must also have." They were determined to scale the heights of science and technology, designing and manufacturing pure soft water equipment themselves.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, under the leadership of the revolutionary committee of the section, the broad masses of revolutionary workers engaged in struggle against the class enemy, dragging the class enemy to the construction site for criticism. This greatly raised the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the masses, further solidifying their determination to do a good job with the pure soft water equipment. The comrades of the soft water electrical group, in the process of designing and manufacturing the automated distribution panel, encouraged each other with the spirit of the Foolish Old Man who moved mountains, pooling their wisdom and strength to solve technical difficulties. The comrades of the water channel group, in the construction process, braved wind and rain, day and night, fighting continuously to complete the installation of the pipeline under the tracks. Due to the full play of the initiative and creativity of all the revolutionary workers in the section, with the assistance of brother units, they overcame difficulties in technology, equipment, materials, and personnel, and successfully achieved the task of supplying pure soft water for locomotives on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line and the Zhejiang-Gan Line (from Hangzhou to Jinhua).

　　杭州铁路分局实现对机车供应净软水
    在无产阶级文化大革命大好形势鼓舞下，杭州铁路分局水电段的革命职工，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬敢想、敢说、敢干的革命精神，经过一年多努力，实现了对机车供应净软水。
    天然水经过化学处理，去掉碱质、减轻硬度，就叫做净软水。机车使用净软水，对延长机车的洗炉周期，节约用煤，提高牵引力等都有很大作用。
    过去，有关部门曾打算从国外进口净软水设备，可是帝国主义国家却狂妄地说什么：“这种自动化的软水设备你们中国不但做不来，卖给你们也不会用。”水电段的广大革命职工听到以后非常气愤，他们反复地学习了毛主席的教导：“中国人民有志气，有能力，一定要在不远的将来，赶上和超过世界先进水平”。职工们豪迈地说：“外国有的，我们一定要有；外国没有的，我们也要有。”他们决心攀登科学技术高峰，自己设计、制造净软水设备。
    无产阶级文化大革命运动中，广大革命职工在段革委会的领导下，和阶级敌人进行针锋相对的斗争，他们把阶级敌人拉到施工工地进行批判，大大提高了广大群众的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，进一步坚定了搞好净软水设备的决心。软水电气组的同志们在设计、制造自动化配电盘的过程中，用愚公移山的精神相互鼓励，群策群力，解决了技术上的困难。水道组的同志在施工中，顶风冒雨，不分昼夜，连续苦战，完成了穿轨管路的安装工程。由于全段革命职工充分发挥了积极性、创造性，在兄弟单位的协助下，他们克服了技术、设备、材料、人员等方面的困难，胜利地实现了沪杭线和浙赣线（杭州到金华段）对机车供应净软水的任务。（据新华社）
