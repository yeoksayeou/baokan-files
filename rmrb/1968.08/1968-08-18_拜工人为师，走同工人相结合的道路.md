Our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "Universities should still be run, and I am mainly talking about universities of science and technology. The system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, and proletarian politics should be in command. Follow the path of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory in cultivating technical personnel from among workers. Select students from workers and peasants with practical experience, have them study in school for a few years, and then return to production practice." Chairman Mao's latest instructions also point out the direction for us to learn from the worker masses.

From primary school to university, I studied for over ten years, basically receiving bourgeois education. After leaving school, I stayed in the office for over seven years. In 1959, I participated in scientific research work. Due to long-term poisoning by revisionist thought, ideas like "technology first" and that scientific research mainly relies on foreign materials made me bury myself in learning foreign languages and reading materials, treating Westerners and Western doctrines as gods. Experiments that foreigners had not done, I dared not do. However, following foreign materials to conduct experiments often led to failures, and I suffered a lot.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great revolution that touches people's souls. In this great revolution, through studying Chairman Mao's works, criticizing the "slave philosophy" and "crawling philosophy" of China's Khrushchev and other revisionist fallacies, I further realized that in the past, I engaged in scientific research in isolation, from the library to the laboratory, from formulas to theories, from calculations to curves, from experiments to papers, following a path that separated from proletarian politics, from the worker masses, and from production practice, pursuing bourgeois personal fame and gain. This is the revisionist path advocated by China's Khrushchev, and continuing down this path is very dangerous. Therefore, in a new technological experiment, we followed Chairman Mao's teachings and began to shift our focus, "putting down our airs and sincerely learning from workers."

Workers comrades armed with Mao Zedong Thought made significant contributions in this experiment. They have deep proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao and the Party. They have rich practical experience. They are not only the main force in class struggle and production struggle but also the main force in scientific experiments. On the road to advancing science and technology, they can do what they say and use actual actions to refute China's Khrushchev's "slave philosophy" and "crawling philosophy," forever being our examples to learn from. Through this experiment, we deeply felt Chairman Mao's teaching that "intellectuals, if they do not combine with the workers and peasants, will accomplish nothing." For us technical personnel who came out of schools, this is how important and to the point it is. I am determined to firmly and unshakably follow Chairman Mao's teachings, often participate in production labor, learn from workers, and follow the path of combining with workers and combining theory with practice. While transforming the objective world, I will also transform the subjective world.

    拜工人为师，走同工人相结合的道路
    北京维尼纶厂化纤研究所　余振浩
    我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席最近深刻地指出：“大学还是要办的，我这里主要说的是理工科大学还要办，但学制要缩短，教育要革命，要无产阶级政治挂帅，走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路。要从有实践经验的工人农民中间选拔学生，到学校学几年以后，又回到生产实践中去。”毛主席的最新指示同时也给我们指出了向工人群众学习的前进的方向。
    我从小学到大学，读了十多年书，基本上受的是资产阶级教育。出学校门以后，在机关里蹲了七年多，一九五九年参加科学研究工作。由于长期受修正主义思想毒害，什么“技术第一”，什么搞科研主要靠看外国资料等等，使我埋头于学外文，看资料，把洋人、洋教条敬若神明。外国没有做过的实验，我不敢做。但是，照外国资料做实验，又常常碰壁，吃足了苦头。
    无产阶级文化大革命是触及人们灵魂的大革命。我在这个大革命中通过学习毛主席著作，批判中国赫鲁晓夫的“洋奴哲学”、“爬行哲学”等修正主义谬论，进一步认识到过去闭门搞科学研究，从图书馆到实验室，从公式到理论，从计算到曲线，从试验到论文，走的是脱离无产阶级政治、脱离工人群众、脱离生产实践的追求资产阶级个人名利的道路，也就是中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的修正主义道路，这样走下去，非常危险。于是，在一项新技术试验中，我们遵照毛主席的教导，开始把立足点移过来，“放下臭架子、甘当小学生”，老老实实向工人学习。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人同志们，在这次试验中作出了重大贡献，他们对毛主席对党有深厚的无产阶级感情，他们有丰富的实践经验。他们不仅是阶级斗争、生产斗争中的主力军，而且是科学实验中的主力军。他们在向科学技术进军的道路上，说得到，做得到，用实际行动批驳了中国赫鲁晓夫的“洋奴哲学”、“爬行哲学”，永远是我们学习的榜样。通过这次试验，我们更加深刻地体会到毛主席关于“知识分子如果不和工农民众相结合，则将一事无成”的教导，对于我们从学校中出来的技术人员说来，是多么重要多么切中要害。我决心坚定不移地老老实实地按照毛主席的教导，经常参加生产劳动，拜工人为师，走同工人相结合的道路，走理论和实践相结合的道路，在改造客观世界的同时，改造主观世界。
