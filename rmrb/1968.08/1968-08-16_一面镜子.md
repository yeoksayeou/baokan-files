As the Soviet revisionist clique fully restores capitalism, advertisements in Soviet revisionist publications are proliferating like mold, spreading the decaying stench of bourgeois ideology and lifestyle.

The content of these advertisements, ranging from the peddling of means of production, the sale of villas and gardens, the purchase of medals, the promotion of lottery tickets, to the recruitment of "experts" and the hiring of workers, is truly a spectacle, nothing is missing. They act like mirrors, reflecting the ugly essence of the Soviet revisionist clique's restoration of capitalism in various aspects of social life.

Advertisements in bourgeois publications are tools for the bourgeoisie to peddle commodities, compete with each other, and seize profits. They are also means to corrupt and poison the broad masses of people. Advertisements in Soviet revisionist publications are no different from those in capitalist countries. They serve the same purpose of exploiting the blood and sweat of the people and promoting the lifestyle of the exploiting class for the new bourgeoisie in the Soviet Union.

Despite the variety of these Soviet revisionist advertisements, they share a common characteristic: whether it is "public" property or private possessions, from large machines and warehouses to small jewelry and foreign postcards, even personal knowledge, skills, and labor power, all have become commodities in the free market. This indicates that the Soviet revisionist clique has long since turned the socialist economy of the Soviet Union, which is owned by the whole people, into a thoroughly capitalist economy.

Engels once wrote about the British bourgeoisie treating all human relationships as monetary and commercial relationships: "All their relationships are expressed in commercial terms, economic concepts. Supply and demand, this is the logical formula that the British use to judge the whole of human life." From the advertisements in Soviet revisionist publications, one can see that the capitalist law of everything for money has taken a dominant position in the Soviet economy and social life. This is an irrefutable crime of the Soviet revisionist clique.

    一面镜子
    随着苏修叛徒集团全面复辟资本主义，苏修报刊上的广告正在象霉菌一样地繁殖起来，散发出资产阶级意识形态和生活方式的腐朽气息。
    这种广告的内容，从倒卖生产资料、出售别墅花园、收购勋章、推销彩票，直到招聘“专家”、征招工人，简直是洋洋大观，无奇不有。它们象镜子一样，反映出苏修叛徒集团在社会生活各个方面复辟资本主义的丑恶本质。
    资产阶级报刊上的广告，是资产阶级推销商品、互相竞争、夺取利润的一种工具，也是腐蚀和毒害广大人民的一种手段。苏修报刊的广告同资本主义国家的广告没有根本差别。它同样是为苏联的新资产阶级榨取人民血汗、宣扬剥削阶级生活方式服务的。
    苏修的这种广告尽管五花八门，却反映了一个共同的特点。这就是：无论“公有”的资产或私人的财物，大至机器、库房，小至首饰、外国明信片，甚至个人的知识、技能和劳力，都成了自由市场上的商品。这就表明：苏修叛徒集团早已把苏联的全民所有制的社会主义经济变成为彻头彻尾的资本主义经济了。
    恩格斯在谈到英国资产阶级把一切人的关系都当作金钱关系和买卖关系时，曾经写道：他们的“一切关系都用商业术语、经济概念来表现。供应和需求，这就是英国人用来判断整个人生的逻辑公式”。从苏修报刊上的广告可以看到：一切为了金钱的资本主义法则已经在苏联经济和社会生活中占了支配地位。这是苏修叛徒集团十恶不赦的一个罪证。
