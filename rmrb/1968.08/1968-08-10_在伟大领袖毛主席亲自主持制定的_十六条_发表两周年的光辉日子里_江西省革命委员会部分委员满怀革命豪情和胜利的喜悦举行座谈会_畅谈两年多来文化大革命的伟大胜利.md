We resolutely vow to be forever loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

We will eliminate the pernicious influence of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, complete the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation on all fronts, and seize the comprehensive victory of the proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The People's Daily reports: On the glorious day of the two-year anniversary of the publication of the decision by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally presided over by our great leader Chairman Mao, some comrades attending the third plenary session (expanded) of the Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee, filled with the joy of victory and revolutionary fervor, held a symposium. They reviewed the two-year journey under the guidance of this epoch-making great historical document and discussed the great victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led and initiated by Chairman Mao. The attendees most resolutely expressed: We must forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Under the command of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, we will unite our wills, steps, and actions, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, advance victoriously, and seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

"The 'Sixteen Points' is the Great Charter of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution"

Program Shiqing (Chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee):

The "Sixteen Points" personally presided over by the great leader Chairman Mao is the great charter of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It greatly enriches and develops Marxism-Leninism, and profoundly elucidates the theory, line, policy, method, and principles of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. It points out the bright road to carry the socialist revolution to the end and to transition from socialism to communism. The "Sixteen Points" not only have great contemporary significance but also have profound historical and international significance.

In the past two years, the 22 million people of Jinggangshan, along with hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses across the country, under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and guided by the "Sixteen Points" and Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, have launched an unprecedented great revolutionary mass movement in world history, achieving great successes and accumulating extremely rich and precious experiences. All fronts have taken on a new look. The situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is excellent and getting better and better.

In the past two years, the heroic people of Jinggangshan, hoisting the great banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries," have wielded the mighty hammer of Mao Zedong Thought to expose, struggle against, and criticize the Chinese Khrushchev and other top walkers of the capitalist road within the party. They have thoroughly smashed the reactionary headquarters representing the interests of the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and Kuomintang reactionaries, which attempted to restore capitalism. They have exposed their agents in Jiangxi and captured their reactionary fortresses. Revolutionary committees at all levels in the province have been established one after another in the face of class struggle storms. In this "political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes," the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad proletarian revolutionary masses and revolutionary masses have greatly increased. Tens of thousands of revolutionary pioneers have emerged, and a large number of revolutionary cadres have been tested. The successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause are growing vigorously.

In the past two years, the heroic people of Jinggangshan, combining the practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have taken Vice Chairman Lin as a shining example to carry out the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. This has greatly promoted the ideological revolution of the people. Throughout the province, the scene of "carrying the precious book at all times and studying whenever there is time," "not speaking a word without Chairman Mao's words and not acting without Chairman Mao's teachings" has emerged. Many advanced collectives and individuals who study and apply Mao Zedong Thought have emerged. Various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes have sprung up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, covering every corner of the province. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is widely spread and deeply rooted in people's hearts.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "Seizing national victory is only the first step in the Long March of ten thousand li. ... The Chinese revolution is great, but the road after the revolution is longer, the work is greater, and the struggle is more arduous. This must be made clear to the party now, and comrades must continue to maintain the style of modesty, prudence, no arrogance, and no impetuosity, and continue to maintain the style of hard struggle." On the occasion of the two-year anniversary of the publication of the programmatic document of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the "Sixteen Points," we must firmly remember Chairman Mao's great teachings, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, lead the people of Jinggangshan to closely unite around the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, strengthen the proletarian dictatorship, intensify the struggle against the enemy, carry out a deep and prolonged revolutionary criticism, thoroughly clean out the class ranks, eliminate the pernicious influence of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, complete the great tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation on all fronts, and seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Zhang Hongdi (Worker of Anshan Coal Mine, Deputy Chairman of the Pingxiang Mining Bureau Revolutionary Committee):

Two years ago, the top walker of the capitalist road within the party, Chinese Khrushchev, was shamelessly trying to revise the brilliant history of the revolutionary struggle of the Anshan miners, usurp the great historical achievements of our great leader Chairman Mao, and claim the revolutionary achievements of Anshan for himself, putting gold on his own face. The agents of Chinese Khrushchev in Jiangxi, such as Fang Zhichun, also distorted history and spared no effort to build monuments and write biographies for him, creating a counter-revolutionary public opinion for his evil goal of usurping the party, the army, and the government. After the start of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we revolutionary workers of Pingxiang Mine, under the guidance of the brilliant document "Sixteen Points" personally presided over by Chairman Mao, fearlessly launched a fierce attack on the bourgeois headquarters headed by Chinese Khrushchev. We thoroughly exposed and criticized their heinous crimes of long-term resistance to the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, opposition to Mao Zedong Thought, and opposition to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We dug out their agents planted in our mine and restored the revolutionary history of the Anshan miners, which had been distorted by them. Now, the revolutionary and production situation of Pingxiang Coal Mine is excellent.

Hu Huaxian (National Agricultural Labor Model, Deputy Chairman of the Yichang County Revolutionary Committee, Party Branch Secretary of Dadao Brigade, Dadao Village):

Chairman Mao personally presided over the formulation of the "Sixteen Points," which points out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a powerful driving force for the development of social productive forces in our country." Hundreds of millions of revolutionary people across the country have directed the boundless revolutionary enthusiasm unleashed in the two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution into production, and a new high tide of socialist construction has emerged. Take our Dadao Brigade as an example. In the past two years, with the unprecedented spread of Mao Zedong Thought and the deep and prolonged revolutionary criticism, we have thoroughly criticized and exposed the revisionist trash of Chinese Khrushchev such as "self-reliance, self-management, self-sufficiency," "four freedoms," "material incentives," and "work points as the commander." The socialist consciousness of the poor and lower-middle peasants has reached an unprecedented height, and the spirit of hard struggle and self-reliance has been unprecedentedly carried forward. We, the poor and lower-middle peasants of the entire brigade, have fought hard for two years, spent not a single penny of the state's money, and built six water and electricity irrigation stations with our own hands. All the fields have basically been freed from the threat of drought, realizing the ideal that our poor and lower-middle peasants have longed for generation after generation. Due to the great improvement of water conservancy facilities, grain and cotton have increased year by year, and the collective economy has prospered year by year. The members of the entire brigade are more determined to march forward on the socialist road!

Mao Zedong Thought is the Action Guide for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution

Wan Lihang (Deputy Chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee, Responsible Person of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee), Cai Fanggen (Member of the Standing Committee of the Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee, Responsible Person of the Provincial Red Guards):

The "Sixteen Points" stipulates: "In the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, cadres, and intellectuals, a movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works should be carried out, and Mao Zedong Thought should be taken as the action guide for the cultural revolution."

In the past two years, at every critical moment of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our great helmsman Chairman Mao has timely issued the latest instructions, guiding us to bypass reefs, cross rapids, and break waves, advancing from victory to victory. Countless facts have proven that when we resolutely act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, the revolution develops and advances; when we deviate from the revolutionary track guided by Chairman Mao or follow it loosely, we will take detours and suffer setbacks. "Navigating the sea relies on the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." This is an absolute truth.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the waves of class struggle follow one after another. In the revolutionary torrent, we deeply feel that only by having a "loyal" heart to Chairman Mao and a "use" emphasis on Mao Zedong Thought can the Cultural Revolution proceed on the correct track. Whether or not we follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, whether we act according to the instructions of the proletarian headquarters or act according to our own feelings, replacing policies with emotions, is the touchstone to measure whether we are loyal to Chairman Mao, and it is the key to whether the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution can develop smoothly.

Now, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories, and the proletarian revolutionary masses have taken power. To manage power for the revolution and use power for the revolution, we must further arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought. We must always analyze the situation and grasp the direction with Chairman Mao's series of theories, lines, policies, methods, and principles on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, to eliminate the interference of "left" and "right" and seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Zhi Fuling (Member of the Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee, Party Branch Secretary of Zhihu Village, Luhu Commune, Lianchuan County):

Under the brilliant guidance of the "Sixteen Points" personally presided over by the great leader Chairman Mao, after the great storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our Zhihu Village, like other places, has undergone earth-shaking changes. The most prominent feature is the emergence of a new situation where the broad revolutionary masses love Chairman Mao, are loyal to Chairman Mao, read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and study and apply Mao Zedong Thought. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses have consciously taken studying and applying Chairman Mao's works as the most important thing. The 80-year-old old poor peasant Zhi Xingcun diligently studies Chairman Mao's works. When someone advised him to rest, he said: "Chairman Mao's books are priceless treasures, loved by the poor and lower-middle peasants. Only by reading them can we remain young at heart and have high revolutionary enthusiasm." Now, all the villagers and cadres in our entire village, in addition to having fixed time to study Chairman Mao's works, also study before and after meetings. In the fields, corners, construction sites, and homes, all have become places to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. Everyone is determined to turn Zhihu into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.

The Revolutionary Mass Movement Under the Guidance of Mao Zedong Thought is Excellent

Guo Derun (Chairman of the Ninggang County Revolutionary Committee):

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao is the broadest, deepest, and largest revolutionary mass movement. It fully embodies the greatest ambition, greatest genius, and highest prestige of our most respected leader Chairman Mao. This greatest mass movement has established the greatest historical merit. Without this great mass movement, the handful of walkers of the capitalist road within the party would not have been exposed, and the bourgeois headquarters headed by Chinese Khrushchev would not have been thoroughly smashed. Without this great mass movement, I might have made more mistakes, deviating more from Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the socialist road. On the joyous day of the two-year anniversary of the publication of the "Sixteen Points" personally presided over by Chairman Mao, I want to most enthusiastically shout: The great revolutionary mass movement under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought is excellent!

This great revolutionary mass movement, for me, a cadre who served as the county party committee secretary, is the greatest education, the greatest help, and the greatest rescue. As soon as the magnificent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began, I did not understand it, was not serious, and was not effective. I was afraid, stuck to the old rules, and faced the impact of the revolutionary mass movement. I suppressed the broad masses and committed errors. When the revolutionary masses rose up to "shell" and "burn" me, I was full of resentment and opposed the revolutionary masses. However, the broad revolutionary masses always insisted on acting according to Mao Zedong Thought. They did not let go of any of my mistakes, criticizing them one by one with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. For every bit of my progress, they also saw it and encouraged me enthusiastically. The revolutionary masses had high standards and strict requirements for me, which deeply moved me. I compared myself with the "Sixteen Points" and the "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," realizing that I had indeed stood on the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie. The profound criticism of the masses made me realize that before the Cultural Revolution, I had promoted some of the black goods of Chinese Khrushchev and done capitalist things, thinking I was doing socialism. I began to taste the sweetness of the mass movement. I changed the "fear" to "dare," changed believing in myself to believing in the masses, and boldly went to the masses to expose my private thoughts. In this way, as the "Sixteen Points" pointed out, "as long as they seriously carry out self-criticism and accept criticism from the masses, they will be forgiven by the party and the masses." I quickly gained the forgiveness and trust of the masses. When the county revolutionary committee was established, I was still selected to serve as the main leader of the revolutionary committee. Chairman Mao's teachings are: "We should believe in the masses, we should believe in the party." In the Cultural Revolution, I truly understood these two fundamental principles. In the future, I will resolutely study and apply the "Sixteen Points," follow the mass line of "from the masses, to the masses," carry forward the party's fine tradition of closely connecting with the masses, and always plant my roots among the masses.

Niu Xi (Chairman of the Dexing County Revolutionary Committee):

The revolutionary mass movement under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought is excellent. This excellence is indescribable and inexhaustible. Just take me as an example. When the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began, I served as the county party committee secretary, executed the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, made mistakes, and was unwilling to make a self-criticism. Later, I went to Beijing with the revolutionary Red Guards. Along the way, the Red Guards cared for me politically, helped me study Chairman Mao's works, and enlightened me to recognize my mistakes in terms of the struggle between the two lines. In Beijing, I also saw with my own eyes the Red Guards and the proletarian revolutionary masses fearlessly resisting violence and attacks, launching a fierce attack on the bourgeois headquarters headed by Chinese Khrushchev. The handful of walkers of the capitalist road within the party and the reactionary academic "authorities" were all defeated. I saw the great power of the revolutionary mass movement, which gave me a profound lesson. The day after returning from Beijing, the Red Guards and the proletarian revolutionary masses held a meeting to criticize my mistakes, which deeply touched my soul. I thought, to prevent the socialist mountains from changing color and to prevent the country from becoming revisionist, I must thoroughly reform my bourgeois worldview. I decided to return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Following Chairman Mao's teachings: "You should put politics in command, go to the masses, be with the masses, and make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution better." I took steps to go to the organs, schools, and rural areas, making self-criticisms to the broad masses on the one hand and learning from the masses on the other. Over time, my relationship with the Red Guards and the proletarian revolutionary masses became closer, and I deeply realized: The masses are the true heroes! In the future, I will resolutely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, insist on going to the masses to temper and reform myself!

Forever Loyal to the Proletarian Headquarters Headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin

Chen Zhiguo (First Deputy Chairman of the Jinggangshan Special District Revolutionary Committee):

Vice Chairman Lin said: "This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the supreme commander is our Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao is the commander-in-chief. Under the command of our great commander-in-chief, if we listen well to our commander-in-chief—Chairman Mao, the Cultural Revolution will definitely develop smoothly and achieve great victories!" The great victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the past two years fully prove this great truth. We, the people of Jinggangshan, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have seriously listened to Chairman Mao's words, acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and resolutely executed all the commands of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. Everyone has carried forward the thorough revolutionary spirit cultivated by Chairman Mao, launching a fierce attack on the handful of walkers of the capitalist road within the party. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions on achieving great unity and the three-in-one combination, the Jinggangshan Special District took the lead in establishing the revolutionary committee in the province and took the lead in achieving a red area throughout the district. The revolutionary committees at all levels also followed Chairman Mao's teachings, leading the heroic people of Jinggangshan to launch a fierce attack on the hidden traitors, spies, and other counter-revolutionaries, achieving great victories in the struggle against the enemy. At the same time, we, the people of Jinggangshan, have resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution and promote production," directing the boundless revolutionary enthusiasm unleashed in the Cultural Revolution into production and construction. The industrial production of the entire district is booming, and agriculture has a good harvest. All the achievements of the people of Jinggangshan are due to the great leader Chairman Mao! All our victories are the great victories of Mao Zedong Thought!

We, the people of Jinggangshan, have deeply felt from the practice of revolutionary struggle that following Chairman Mao is invincible. The proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin is the only leadership center for the entire party, the entire army, the entire country, and the broad revolutionary masses. In our hearts, there is only one thought—Mao Zedong Thought, and only one center—the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. We, the people of Jinggangshan, are nurtured and grown by Chairman Mao. We love Chairman Mao infinitely and are forever loyal to the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. We will forever closely unite around Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters, going from victory to victory!

Zhang Yu (Chairman of the Hongdu Machinery Factory Revolutionary Committee):

In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we workers of Hongdu, along with hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses across the country, under the guidance of the "Sixteen Points" personally presided over by Chairman Mao, and under the command of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, launched a fierce attack on the bourgeois headquarters headed by Chinese Khrushchev. We thoroughly smashed their dream of restoring capitalism and achieved the decisive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We workers of Hongdu have deeply realized in the struggle that the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin most concentratedly represent the fundamental interests of the proletariat and the people of the entire country, are the most resolute in protecting the people, the most resolute in suppressing the class enemy, and the most firm in leading the people of the entire country to walk the socialist road. This is a revolutionary leadership center, a victorious leadership center. Our entire party, army, and country can only have such a center and cannot have a second center.

At this critical moment of seizing the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must be more loyal to the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, strengthen the proletarian overall concept, and strengthen revolutionary organizational discipline. Now, a few people have swollen heads, do not know the height of the sky and the depth of the earth, do not want proletarian organizational discipline, do not execute Chairman Mao's instructions, and do what "I am the center." This is something that the working class will never allow! What "I am the center"? It is to create bourgeois factionalism, splittism, and individualism. It disperses the unity of the revolutionary ranks on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, hinders the execution of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and interferes with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. Chairman Mao teaches us: "All erroneous thoughts, all poisonous weeds, all monsters and ghosts should be criticized, and they must not be allowed to spread freely." We must resolutely criticize and expose the reactionary "multi-center theory," criticize it to the end, and never allow it to spread freely. We workers of Hongdu advise those who look down on workers and peasants, think they are great, and are still creating "I am the center" to make a firm decision, put down their arrogant attitudes, and sincerely learn from workers and peasants. Use Mao Zedong Thought to reform their bourgeois worldview and quickly catch up with the magnificent steps of hundreds of millions of revolutionary people.

    决心永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的号令下，统一意志，统一步伐，统一行动，彻底粉碎反动的资产阶级的“多中心论”；决心加强无产阶级专政，加强对敌斗争，深入持久地开展革命大批判，切实做好清理阶级队伍的工作，把中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义路线的恶劣影响清除干净，完成各条战线上的斗、批、改任务，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利
    本报讯　在我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的《中国共产党中央委员会关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》发表两周年的光辉日子里，出席江西省革命委员会第三次全体委员（扩大）会议的部分同志，满怀胜利的喜悦和革命的豪情，举行座谈会，回顾两年来在这划时代的伟大历史文献指引下走过的战斗历程，畅谈毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利。到会同志最坚决地表示：要永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的号令下，统一意志，统一步伐，统一行动，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，乘胜前进，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    “十六条”是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大纲领
    程世清（江西省革命委员会主任）：
    伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”，是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大纲领，极大地丰富和发展了马克思列宁主义，非常精辟地阐明了在无产阶级专政条件下继续进行革命的理论、路线、方针、方法和政策，指出了把社会主义革命进行到底，由社会主义过渡到共产主义的光辉道路。“十六条”不仅具有伟大的现实意义，而且具有深远的历史意义和国际意义。
    两年来，两千二百万井冈山儿女和全国亿万革命群众一道，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的领导下，在“十六条”和毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，开展了世界历史上空前规模的伟大革命群众运动，取得了伟大的成就，积累了极其丰富和宝贵的经验，各条战线出现了崭新的面貌。无产阶级文化大革命形势一片大好，并且越来越好。
    两年来，英雄的井冈山儿女，高举“对反动派造反有理”的大旗，奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，对中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派进行了大揭露、大斗争、大批判，彻底摧毁了代表美帝、苏修、国民党反动派利益，妄图复辟资本主义的资产阶级司令部，揪出了他们在江西的代理人，攻下了他们盘踞的反动堡垒。全省各级革命委员会迎着阶级斗争的暴风雨先后建立。在这场“无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命”中，广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟大大提高，涌现出成千上万的革命闯将，也考验了一大批革命的领导干部，无产阶级革命事业的接班人正在茁壮地成长。
    两年来，英雄的井冈山儿女结合无产阶级文化大革命的斗争实践，以林副主席为光辉榜样，开展了活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，大大促进了人的思想革命化。全省各地出现了“宝书随身带，有空学起来”、“口不离毛主席的话，行动不离毛主席教导”的动人局面，涌现了一大批活学活用毛泽东思想的先进集体和先进人物。各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班如雨后春笋，遍布全省每个角落。战无不胜的毛泽东思想大普及、大传播，越来越深入人心。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“夺取全国胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步。……中国的革命是伟大的，但革命以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦。这一点现在就必须向党内讲明白，务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风。”在纪念无产阶级文化大革命的纲领性文件——“十六条”发表两周年的时候，我们一定牢记毛主席的伟大教导，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，带领井冈山儿女紧紧团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部周围，加强无产阶级专政，加强对敌斗争，深入持久地开展革命大批判，切实做好清理阶级队伍的工作，把中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义路线的恶劣影响清除干净，完成各条战线上的斗、批、改的伟大任务，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    张洪迪（安源煤矿工人、萍乡矿务局革命委员会副主任）：
    两年以前，中国赫鲁晓夫这个党内头号走资派，还在恬不知耻地妄图篡改光辉灿烂的安源路矿工人革命斗争史，篡取我们伟大领袖毛主席的伟大历史功绩，把安源革命斗争成果窃为己有，给自己脸上贴金。中国赫鲁晓夫在江西的代理人方志纯之流，也颠倒历史，不遗余力地拚命为他树碑立传，为他篡党篡军篡政的罪恶目的大造反革命舆论。无产阶级文化大革命开始以后，我们萍矿广大革命职工，在毛主席亲自主持制定的光辉文献“十六条”的指引下，奋不顾身地向以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部发动了猛烈的进攻，狠狠揭露和批判了他们长期以来对抗毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，反对毛泽东思想、反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的滔天罪行，深挖了他们安插在我们矿的代理人，把被他们颠倒了的安源路矿工人革命斗争史再颠倒过来。现在，我们萍乡煤矿革命和生产形势一片大好。
    胡华先（全国农业劳动模范、瑞昌县革命委员会副主任、大桥公社大桥大队党支部书记）：
    毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”中指出：“无产阶级文化大革命是使我国社会生产力发展的一个强大的推动力。”全国亿万革命人民，把在两年无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的冲天革命干劲用到生产上去，社会主义建设出现了新高潮。拿我们大桥大队来说吧。这两年来，随着毛泽东思想空前大普及，随着深入持久地开展革命大批判，彻底批臭了中国赫鲁晓夫“三自一包”、“四大自由”、“物质刺激”、“工分挂帅”等修正主义黑货，贫下中农社会主义觉悟空前大提高，艰苦奋斗、自力更生的精神空前大发扬。我们全大队贫下中农苦战两年，不花国家一文钱，用自己的双手建设起了六个水电排灌站，全部田地基本解除了干旱威胁，实现了我们大队的贫下中农祖祖辈辈梦寐以求的理想。由于水利设施大改善，粮食、棉花一年比一年增产，集体经济一年比一年兴旺。全大队社员更加坚定地在社会主义大道上阔步前进！
    毛泽东思想是无产阶级文化大革命的行动指南
    万里浪（江西省革命委员会副主任、省大联筹负责人）、蔡方根（江西省革命委员会常委、省大中红司负责人）：“十六条”规定：“要在广大工农兵、广大干部和广大知识分子中，开展活学活用毛主席著作的运动，把毛泽东思想作为文化革命的行动指南。”
    两年多来，在无产阶级文化大革命的各个关键时刻，我们的伟大统帅毛主席都及时发出最新指示，引导我们绕过暗礁，越过险滩，乘风破浪，从胜利走向新的胜利。无数的事实证明，当我们坚决按照毛主席的指示办事的时候，革命就发展，就前进；当我们离开毛主席指引的革命轨道或稍微跟得不紧的时候，我们就会走弯路，受挫折。“大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”这是千真万确的真理。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，阶级斗争的浪涛，一个接着一个。在革命的激流中，我们深深体会到，只有对毛主席胸怀一个“忠”字，对毛泽东思想突出一个“用”字，才能使文化大革命沿着正确的航道前进。对毛主席的伟大战略部署是不是紧跟，对毛主席的无产阶级司令部的指示，是有令则行，有禁则止，还是我行我素，以感情代替政策，这是衡量我们是否忠于毛主席的试金石，这是决定无产阶级文化大革命能否顺利发展的关键。
    现在，无产阶级文化大革命已经取得了决定性胜利，无产阶级革命派掌了权，我们被推上了领导岗位。要为革命掌好权，用好权，就必须进一步用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑。时刻以毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的一系列理论、路线、方针、方法和政策来分析形势，掌握方向，才能排除“左”或右的干扰，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    支福龙（江西省革命委员会委员、临川县罗湖公社支村大队党支部书记）：
    在伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”的光辉照耀下，经过无产阶级文化大革命的伟大风暴，我们支村大队和各地一样，发生了翻天覆地的变化。其中最突出的一点，就是出现了广大革命群众人人热爱毛主席，事事忠于毛主席，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，活学活用毛泽东思想的新气象。广大贫下中农和革命群众，都自觉地把活学活用毛主席著作，当作头等重要的大事。八十多岁的老贫农支杏村，孜孜不倦地学习毛主席著作。有人劝他注意休息，他说：
  “毛主席的书是无价宝，贫下中农最爱读，读了才能人老心不老，革命干劲才能高。”现在，我们全大队的社员和干部，除有固定的学习毛主席著作的时间外，会前会后都要学，田头、地角、工地、家庭，都成了活学活用毛主席著作的场所。大家都决心把支村办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    毛泽东思想指引下的革命群众运动好得很
    郭德润（宁冈县革命委员会主任）：
    我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，是一场最广泛、最深刻、规模最大的革命群众运动。它充分体现了我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席的最伟大的气魄，最伟大的天才，最崇高的威望。这场最伟大的群众运动，立下了最伟大的历史功勋。如果没有这一伟大的群众运动，党内一小撮走资派就不可能被揪出来，以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部就不可能被彻底摧垮。如果没有这一伟大的群众运动，我就可能错误越犯越大，离毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，离社会主义道路越来越远。在毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”发表两周年的大喜日子里，我要最热烈地欢呼：毛泽东思想指引下的伟大革命群众运动好得很！
    这场伟大的革命群众运动，对我这个担任前县委书记的干部来说，是一次最大的教育，最大的帮助，最大的挽救。轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命一开始，我很不理解，很不认真，很不得力，“怕”字当头，墨守旧的章法，面对革命群众运动的冲击，又由害怕群众到执行资产阶级反动路线，压制广大群众，结果犯了错误。当革命群众起来“炮打”、“火烧”自己的时候，还怨气冲天，与革命群众相对抗。可是，广大革命群众却始终坚持按毛泽东思想办事。我的错误，他们一点也不放过，一条一条，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想来加以批判。对于我的每一点进步，也都看在眼里，热情地加以鼓励。革命群众对我高标准，严要求，使我深受感动。我对照“十六条”和《湖南农民运动考察报告》，检查自己对待革命群众运动的态度，认识到自己确实站到了资产阶级反动路线上去了。群众的深刻批判，更使我认识到，文化大革命前自己推行了中国赫鲁晓夫的一些黑货，搞了资本主义的东西，还以为是在搞社会主义。我开始尝到了群众运动的甜头。我就把“怕”字换成“敢”字，把相信自己换成相信群众，大胆地到群众中去亮私斗私。这样一来，正如“十六条”所指出的那样，“他们只要认真进行自我批评，接受群众批评，是会被党和群众谅解的。”我很快取得了群众的谅解和信任。当县革委会成立时，还选我担任了革委会的主要领导工作。毛主席谆谆教导说：“我们应当相信群众，我们应当相信党”。在文化大革命中，我才真正懂得了这两条根本原理。今后，我决心更好地学习“十六条”，运用“十六条”，贯彻执行从群众中来，到群众中去的群众路线，发扬党的紧密联系群众的优良作风，永远扎根于群众之中。
    牛玺（德兴县革命委员会主任）：
    毛泽东思想指引下的革命群众运动好得很。这个好，说不完，讲不尽。就说我自己吧。无产阶级文化大革命开始的时候，我担任县委书记，执行了资产阶级反动路线，犯了错误，还不愿作检查。后来，我和革命的红卫兵小将一起到北京去。一路上，红卫兵小将在政治上关心我，帮助我学习毛主席著作，启发我把自己的错误提到两条路线斗争上来认识。在北京，我又亲眼看到红卫兵小将和无产阶级革命派，不畏强暴，不怕围攻，向以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部展开猛烈的进攻。党内一小撮走资派，反动的学术“权威”，统统被打得落花流水。我看到了革命群众运动的伟大力量，给我上了深刻的一课。从北京回来的第二天，红卫兵小将和无产阶级革命派召开大会，对我的错误进行了批判，再一次狠触了我的灵魂。我想，为了社会主义江山不变颜色，为了使国家不出修正主义，必须彻底改造资产阶级世界观。我决心回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。遵照毛主席的教导：“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。”我迈开双脚，到机关、学校、农村中去，一面向广大群众作检查，一面向群众学习。时间长了，我和红卫兵小将、无产阶级革命派的关系逐渐地亲密起来了，我也越来越深刻地体会到：群众是真正的英雄！今后，我决心照毛主席的教导，坚持到群众中去锻炼改造自己！
    永远忠于以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部
    陈治国（井冈山专区革命委员会第一副主任）：
    林副主席说：“这次无产阶级文化大革命，最高司令是我们毛主席。毛主席是统帅。我们在伟大统帅的指挥下，好好地听我们统帅——毛主席的话，文化大革命一定能顺利发展，一定能取得伟大胜利！”两年多来无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，充分证明了这一伟大的真理。我们井冈山儿女在无产阶级文化大革命中，认真听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，坚决执行以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的一切号令。大家发扬毛主席亲手培育的井冈山彻底革命精神，向党内一小撮走资派发动了猛烈进攻。在毛主席实现革命大联合和革命三结合的最新指示指引下，井冈山专区在全省领先成立了革委会，又领先实现了全区一片红。各级革委会还遵照毛主席的教导，率领英雄的井冈山儿女，向暗藏的叛徒、特务和其他反革命分子发动猛攻，取得了对敌斗争的重大胜利。与此同时，我们井冈山儿女坚决执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，把文化大革命中焕发出来的冲天革命干劲用到生产建设上去。全区工业生产蒸蒸日上，农业获得好收成。我们井冈山儿女的一切成绩，都归功于伟大的领袖毛主席！我们的一切胜利，都是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！
    我们井冈山儿女从革命斗争实践中，深刻地体会到，紧跟毛主席，革命无不胜。以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，是全党、全军、全国和广大革命群众唯一的领导中心。在我们井冈山儿女的心目中，只有一个思想——毛泽东思想，只有一个中心——以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部。我们井冈山儿女是毛主席亲自培育成长起来的。我们无限热爱毛主席，永远忠于以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，永远紧密团结在毛主席的无产阶级司令部的周围，去夺取一个又一个的胜利！
    张羽（洪都机械厂革命委员会主任）：
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们洪都工人和全国亿万革命群众一起，在毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”的指引下，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的统帅下，向以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部发动了猛烈进攻，彻底粉碎了他们复辟资本主义的迷梦，取得了无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利。我们洪都工人在斗争中更加深刻地认识到：以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，最集中地代表了无产阶级和全国人民群众的根本利益，是最坚决保护人民群众、最坚决镇压阶级敌人、最坚定地领导全国人民走社会主义道路的领导中心。这是一个革命的领导中心，胜利的领导中心。我们全党、全军、全国只能有这样一个中心，不能有第二个中心。
    在当前夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的关键时刻，我们对以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部更要无限忠诚，更要加强无产阶级的整体观念，更要加强革命的组织纪律性。现在，有极少数人头脑发胀，不知天高地厚，不要无产阶级的组织纪律，不执行毛主席的指示，搞什么“以我为中心”。这是我们工人阶级决不容许的！什么“以我为中心”？就是搞资产阶级的山头主义、分裂主义、个人主义。它涣散革命队伍在毛泽东思想基础上的团结，妨碍毛主席无产阶级革命路线的执行，干扰毛主席的伟大战略部署。毛主席教导我们：“凡是错误的思想，凡是毒草，凡是牛鬼蛇神，都应该进行批判，决不能让它们自由泛滥。”对反动的“多中心论”，我们要坚决批判，把它批倒批臭，决不能让它自由泛滥。我们洪都工人奉劝那些看不起工农，自以为了不起，还在那里搞“以我为中心”的人，痛下决心，放下臭架子，老老实实向工农学习，以毛泽东思想改造自己的资产阶级世界观，迅速赶上亿万革命人民的雄伟步伐。
