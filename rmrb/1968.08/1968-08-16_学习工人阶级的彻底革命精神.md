The great leader Chairman Mao's latest directive: "Our country has 700 million people, and the working class is the leading class. We must fully bring into play the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in all work. The working class should also constantly raise its political consciousness in the struggle."

In our socialist revolution and socialist construction, the working class has always been the vanguard of the revolution, the pioneers of production, and the leading force of the revolutionary movement. Chairman Mao, in summing up the practice of the Chinese revolution, once pointed out: "People's democratic dictatorship needs the leadership of the working class. Because only the working class has the foresight, is selfless, and is most thorough in revolution. The whole history of revolution has proved that without the leadership of the working class, the revolution will fail, and with the leadership of the working class, the revolution will be victorious." The revolutionary war led by Chairman Mao, from its inception, was a people's revolutionary war led by the working class, with peasants and other revolutionary masses as the main body. In this political revolution that decides the future of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, the Chinese working class, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, closely follows Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and implements Chairman Mao's series of latest directives without any deviation. This fully demonstrates the boundless wisdom and strength of the working class, setting a brilliant example for us to learn from.

In learning from the working class, we must first learn from the working class's boundless love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, acting in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, and always following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. In the practice of supporting the left, we have personally seen that they do as Chairman Mao says. In the fierce struggle between the two lines, they have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and launched a fierce attack on the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev. When class enemies play tricks and shoot dark arrows, threatening revolutionary production, they stand up and take the lead in class struggle, firmly guard their production posts, and thoroughly smash the evil plots of class enemies to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. When the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is about to achieve comprehensive victory, they remember Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forget class struggle," heighten their vigilance, and their fighting will is unyielding. They unite all forces that can be united and launch a fierce attack on the class enemies, rooting out a handful of remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and consolidating the newly born revolutionary committees.

Practice has made us deeply realize that the working class has the most political foresight and is thorough in revolutionary spirit. In critical moments of struggle, they defend and execute Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line most resolutely and thoroughly. They are indeed the main force of the revolution and the backbone of the Cultural Revolution.

The ship sails with the helmsman, and the revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, learn from the brilliant example of the working class, learn from their boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, and closely unite around the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, under the command of the proletarian headquarters, unify our thinking, unify our steps, and unify our actions. We must follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    学习工人阶级的彻底革命精神
    支左爱民模范排
    伟大领袖毛主席最新指示：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”明确地指出了工人阶级在无产阶级文化大革命中的领导作用。
    在我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设中，工人阶级始终是抓革命的先锋，促生产的闯将，始终是革命运动的领导力量。毛主席在总结中国革命实践时曾指出：“人民民主专政需要工人阶级的领导。因为只有工人阶级最有远见，大公无私，最富于革命的彻底性。整个革命历史证明，没有工人阶级的领导，革命就要失败，有了工人阶级的领导，革命就胜利了。”毛主席领导的中国革命战争，从它萌芽的第一天起，就是以工人阶级为领导，以农民和其他革命群众为主体的人民革命战争。在目前这场决定中国革命和世界革命前途的政治大革命中，用毛泽东思想武装起来的我国工人阶级紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，不折不扣地落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，充分显示了工人阶级无穷的智慧和力量，为我们树立了光辉的学习榜样。
    我们向工人阶级学习，首先要学工人阶级对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚，一切行动听从毛主席的指挥，时刻紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署的高贵品质和模范行动。在支左实践中，我们亲眼看到，毛主席怎么说，他们就怎么做。在两条路线的激烈斗争中，他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，向以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部发动了猛烈的进攻。在阶级敌人耍阴谋、放暗箭，革命生产受到严重威胁的时候，他们挺身而出，站在阶级斗争的最前列，严守生产岗位，彻底粉碎了阶级敌人破坏无产阶级文化大革命的罪恶阴谋。在无产阶级文化大革命即将取得全面胜利的时候，他们牢记着毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，提高警惕，战斗意志毫不松懈，团结一切可以团结的力量，向阶级敌人发动了猛烈进攻，把一小撮国民党反动派的残渣余孽揪了出来，巩固了新生的革命委员会。
    实践使我们深深体会到：工人阶级最有政治远见，富于彻底的革命精神，在斗争的关键时刻，他们捍卫和执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线最坚决、最彻底。他们不愧是革命的主力军，不愧是左右文化大革命的中坚力量。
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。我们要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，学习工人阶级的光辉榜样，学习他们无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席，紧紧团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的周围，在无产阶级司令部号令下，统一认识，统一步伐，统一行动，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
