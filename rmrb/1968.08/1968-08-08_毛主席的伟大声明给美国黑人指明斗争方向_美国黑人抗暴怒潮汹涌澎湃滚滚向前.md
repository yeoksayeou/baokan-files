Over the past five years, American blacks in their struggle for liberation have shown increasing awareness, beginning to engage in armed resistance and linking their struggle against imperialist aggression abroad with the struggle at home, gradually uniting with the American workers' movement, demonstrating an extremely powerful revolutionary force that has shaken the foundations of American imperialist rule.

According to a report by our correspondent from Xinhua News Agency on August 7: Five years ago (August 8, 1963), the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, issued the "Statement in Support of the American Black People's Just Struggle Against U.S. Imperialism's Racial Discrimination." This statement of great historical significance is a deep expression of concern and resolute support for the broad masses of blacks and all oppressed and exploited people in the United States who are in the struggle. It provides a powerful ideological and theoretical weapon for their revolutionary struggle, pointing the way forward and giving great encouragement to American blacks and revolutionary people all over the world.

In this statement issued five years ago, Chairman Mao pointed out: "The evil system of colonialism and imperialism, which rose to power with the enslavement and trafficking of blacks, will inevitably come to an end with the complete liberation of the black race." Over the past five years, the development of the American blacks' struggle against violence and the revolutionary struggles of people all over the world have increasingly proven that Chairman Mao's great prophecy and wise judgment will surely become a brilliant reality!

Over the past five years, the struggle of American blacks for freedom and liberation has been like molten lava boiling and surging beneath a volcano, erupting with increasing ferocity each year, shaking the land of the United States and seriously undermining the reactionary rule of American imperialism at home. The struggle of American blacks vividly reflects the increasingly sharp class and national contradictions within the United States, as well as the serious political and economic crises currently facing American imperialism. It fully demonstrates the extremely powerful revolutionary force hidden among the more than 20 million American blacks.

Awareness is increasing, resistance is intensifying

Over the past five years, a prominent feature of the American blacks' struggle has been their increasing awareness of the need for self-liberation, as they have resolutely abandoned "non-violence" and launched increasingly large-scale and intense armed resistance struggles.

In 1963, 250,000 blacks marched in Washington, D.C., in a "Freedom March" against racial discrimination, which was still within the realm of "non-violence." By July 1964, the struggle had escalated to a full-scale armed resistance in the Harlem district of New York City, where blacks armed with stones, clubs, and Molotov cocktails fought thousands of police and military for six consecutive days and nights. This marked the beginning of large-scale armed resistance struggles by American blacks. Since then, the armed resistance struggles of American blacks have spread like wildfire across the United States. According to statistics greatly reduced by American bourgeois newspapers: in 1964, 15 cities in the United States saw black armed resistance struggles; in 1965, 9 cities; in 1966, the number quickly rose to 38 cities; in 1967, it jumped to 128 cities; and by the first half of this year, it had spread to 131 cities. The most significant of these struggles were the armed resistance struggles in the Watts district of Los Angeles in 1965, in Chicago in 1966, and in Newark and Detroit in 1967. In these struggles, blacks shouted, "Stand up and fight, don't kneel and beg for life!" fully demonstrating the fearless fighting spirit of American blacks.

In April of this year, the black pastor and non-violent activist Martin Luther King was assassinated by American imperialists. This event further deeply educated the broad masses of American blacks, sparking a new wave of resistance struggles that swept across more than 100 cities in the United States. Blacks shouted, "The time to take up arms has come," attacking fascist police and burning the stores of white racists, destroying the reactionary social order, and plunging major cities like Washington, Chicago, Los Angeles, Detroit, and Baltimore into chaos. The development of armed resistance struggles by blacks has frightened Western bourgeois newspapers, which have repeatedly exclaimed, "The non-violent line is finished."

Opposing racial oppression, opposing the Vietnam War

An important sign of the political awakening of American blacks is that more and more of them are linking the struggle for black liberation with the struggle against American imperialism's policy of external aggression. Some advanced elements have gradually come to realize that the imperialist system must be completely destroyed for blacks to achieve complete liberation.

In recent years, American blacks have strongly opposed racial discrimination and racial oppression in their struggle, shouting the slogan "Black Power" to clearly express their determination to liberate themselves. At the same time, they have actively participated in the struggle of the American people against the Vietnam War, directly striking at American imperialism's policy of aggression. To organize this struggle, blacks across the United States have established organizations to oppose the Vietnam War. In March of this year, American blacks also formed the "National Black Anti-War and Anti-Draft Union." The anti-war demonstrations of black masses have grown more powerful each time, and they have loudly shouted the slogan "Stop the dirty war in Vietnam."

The strong opposition of American blacks to the U.S. imperialist war in Vietnam is also evident in the fact that many black youth have refused to serve in the military, burned their draft cards, and driven away officials who went to black schools to recruit cannon fodder. Black students in such struggles have shouted, "The United States is the real battlefield for blacks!" Many black soldiers who have already enlisted have also defied American imperialist "military law" and refused to be tools of American imperialism's murder. Some black soldiers stationed in Texas even distributed leaflets, advocating that blacks must oppose aggression and rise up in revolution. Black soldiers forced to go to the Vietnam battlefield have also refused to carry out orders. Many black soldiers have also actively supported the anti-violence struggles of blacks at home, continuously sending weapons and ammunition back to the United States to arm their comrades. According to reports, some of the weapons used in the recent Cleveland black anti-violence struggle were sent back from black soldiers in Vietnam.

Violence cannot suppress, tricks cannot deceive

Over the past few years, the fierce storm of the black struggle has occurred in the heart of the American ruling class, both domestically and internationally, and has therefore dealt American imperialism a particularly heavy blow, both politically and economically. The desperate American ruling authorities, in order to extinguish the flames of the black struggle, have intensified the use of violent suppression and political deception, two counter-revolutionary tactics. However, American blacks are fighting stronger and stronger, and neither violence nor tricks can stop the surging tide of the black anti-violence struggle. This is a prominent manifestation of the heroic and tenacious revolutionary spirit of the broad masses of blacks.

Under the heavy blows of the black struggle, the American reactionary ruling class frequently deploys the "National Guard" to suppress blacks. During the nationwide black anti-violence struggle in April of this year, the Johnson administration even deployed more than 70,000 army and "National Guard" troops to carry out brutal suppression. The Associated Press had to admit that "this is the largest force ever deployed in American history to deal with a civilian emergency." The U.S. Department of Defense established a "Special Command Center" in late April of this year to control "riots" and direct the suppression of anti-violence struggles with active-duty troops. The U.S. Army has also increased the number of "Special Task Forces" specifically used to suppress people's struggles from seven to twelve.

While strengthening fascist suppression, the American reactionary ruling class has also intensified the use of political deception. In recent years, the American ruling authorities have annually hyped up a few so-called "Civil Rights Acts" signed in the White House, attempting to issue some blank checks and use some small favors to deceive the black masses and make them give up the struggle. At the same time, the American reactionary ruling class has also selected a few lackeys of the ruling class from among the blacks to serve as judges, legislators, and even generals and mayors, using them on the one hand to decorate the facade and buy hearts, and on the other hand to directly sabotage the black struggle.

However, whether it is violent suppression or political deception, it cannot stop the surging tide of the black anti-violence struggle. Just after the wave of black anti-violence struggles that swept across more than 120 cities in the United States in April, this summer saw the sound of black anti-violence struggles in Cleveland and other places, and it was precisely in Cleveland and Gary, where the American reactionary ruling class had installed black mayors, that the most intense struggles for black liberation broke out. In Cleveland, blacks used machine guns and other weapons in an all-night battle, killing three reactionary police and wounding nineteen. This shows that blacks are continuously raising the level of their anti-violence struggle.

A new call to arms for the American people

In the face of the deepening political and economic crises of American imperialism, the surging black struggle is increasingly influencing and promoting the struggles of the American people in other areas, especially the struggles of progressive students. In the American student movement, black students have been the most heroic and resolute, standing at the forefront of the struggle. The progressive student movement in the United States has developed rapidly in recent years under the promotion of black students. In the first five months of this year, more than 100 universities in the United States saw strikes and demonstrations. The May strike at Columbia University in New York against racial discrimination, the Vietnam War, and political persecution lasted for more than a month and shook the entire United States. Black students and white students at this school fought together, occupying several large buildings, raising red flags, detaining the dean, searching the president's office, and engaging in fierce battles with thousands of fascist police who came to suppress them several times.

As the fierce black anti-violence struggle shakes the reactionary rule of the American monopoly capitalist group, the American workers' movement is also developing rapidly. Since last year, waves of strikes in the United States have risen and fallen, one after another, reaching their highest level in fifteen years in terms of scale and momentum. It is worth noting that, as more and more blacks are forced to move into cities, the majority of American blacks are now workers and unemployed workers, many of whom actively participate in anti-violence struggles and bring the combativeness of the black anti-violence struggle into the American workers' movement. In July last year, a strike by 200 black workers in the transportation department of the Newport News Shipbuilding Company against the capitalists' forced overtime quickly developed into a joint strike by 20,000 white and black workers throughout the factory, and the striking workers engaged in fierce battles with fascist police. In July last year, when large-scale black anti-violence struggles broke out in Detroit, a large number of poor white workers actively participated in this struggle. These signs indicate that the black struggle in the United States will gradually move towards the correct path of uniting with the American workers' movement.

At this important moment when the black struggle in the United States is developing vigorously and the struggles of the American working people are rising, the great leader Chairman Mao issued another statement in support of the American blacks' anti-violence struggle on April 16 of this year. Chairman Mao pointed out: "The struggle of American blacks will inevitably unite with the American workers' movement, ultimately ending the evil rule of the American monopoly capitalist class." Chairman Mao issued a great call to arms: "People of the world, unite more closely, launch a sustained and fierce attack on our common enemy, American imperialism, and its running dogs!" Over the past five years, the waves of the American blacks' struggle for liberation have surged forward, brave and unyielding. The blazing fire of the people of the world against American imperialism burns brighter and brighter. It can be said for certain that the reactionary rule of American imperialism will not last long.

The brave anti-violence struggle of the broad masses of American blacks has gained the sympathy and support of more and more laboring people and progressives of the white race in the United States, and white masses have also joined the ranks of the black struggle, engaging in face-to-face battles with reactionary police.

　　毛主席的伟大声明给美国黑人指明斗争方向
　　美国黑人抗暴怒潮汹涌澎湃滚滚向前
    五年来，美国黑人在争取解放的斗争中觉悟日益提高，开始进行武力抗暴，并同反对美帝的对外侵略政策联系起来，逐步同美国工人运动相结合，显示出极其强大的革命力量，动摇了美帝的反动统治
    据新华社七日讯　本社记者报道：世界革命人民的伟大导师毛主席五年前（一九六三年八月八日）发表了《支持美国黑人反对美帝国主义种族歧视的正义斗争的声明》。毛主席这个具有伟大历史意义的声明，是对斗争中的美国广大黑人和整个被剥削、被压迫的美国人民的深切关怀和坚决支持，给他们的革命斗争提供了强大的思想和理论武器，指明了前进的方向和道路，给美国黑人和全世界革命人民以巨大鼓舞。
    毛主席在五年前发表的这个声明中指出：“万恶的殖民主义、帝国主义制度是随着奴役和贩卖黑人而兴盛起来的，它也必将随着黑色人种的彻底解放而告终。”五年来，美国黑人抗暴斗争和全世界人民革命斗争的蓬勃发展日益证明，毛主席的这个伟大的预言和英明论断，必将变为光辉的现实！
    五年来，美国黑人争取自由解放的斗争，象火山下面翻滚奔腾的熔岩，一年比一年更猛烈地迸发出来，震撼了美国的大地，严重地动摇了美国帝国主义在国内的反动统治。美国黑人的斗争突出地反映了美国国内日益尖锐的阶级矛盾和民族矛盾以及美帝国主义当前面临的严重的政治危机和经济危机，充分地显示了两千多万美国黑人中蕴藏着的极其强大的革命力量。
    觉悟日益提高，反抗日益强烈
    五年来，美国黑人在斗争中表现出的一个显著特点是，他们争取自身解放的觉悟日益提高，不断坚决地抛弃“非暴力主义”，开展规模越来越大、程度越来越激烈的武力抗暴斗争。
    一九六三年，二十五万黑人在华盛顿举行的反对种族歧视的“自由进军”，还是属于“非暴力”的范畴，到一九六四年七月爆发了纽约市哈莱姆区的黑人用石块、棍棒和燃烧瓶作武器同数千军警连续搏斗六昼夜的斗争，揭开了美国黑人大规模武力抗暴斗争的序幕。自此以后，美国黑人的武力抗暴斗争就如燎原烈火，烧遍了美国。据美国资产阶级报刊大大缩小了的统计：一九六四年美国有十五个城市爆发黑人的武力抗暴斗争，一九六五年有九个城市，一九六六年迅速发展为三十八个城市，一九六七年一跃而为一百二十八个城市，到今年上半年扩展到一百三十一个城市。其中规模较大的是一九六五年在洛杉矶的瓦茨区，一九六六年在芝加哥，一九六七年在纽瓦克和底特律爆发的黑人武力抗暴斗争。在这些斗争中，黑人们高呼：“要站起来战斗，不要跪着求生！”充分显示了美国黑人的大无畏战斗精神。
    今年四月，黑人牧师、非暴力主义者马丁·路德·金被美帝国主义者所暗杀。这一事件，进一步深刻地教训了美国的广大黑人群众，激起一场席卷了美国一百几十个城市的抗暴斗争新风暴。黑人们高呼“拿枪上街的时候来到了”，到处袭击法西斯军警，焚烧白人种族主义者的商店，把反动的社会秩序打得稀烂，使华盛顿、芝加哥、洛杉矶、底特律、巴尔的摩等大城市，都陷入一片混乱。黑人武力抗暴斗争的这种蓬勃发展，吓得西方资产阶级报刊一再惊呼，“非暴力主义路线完蛋了”。
    反对种族压迫，反对侵越战争
    美国黑人在政治上加速觉醒的一个重要的标志是，他们中越来越多的人把黑人争取自身解放的斗争同反对美帝国主义的对外侵略政策联系起来，其中有些先进分子逐渐开始认识到，必须彻底摧毁帝国主义制度，否则黑人就不可能获得彻底解放。
    近几年来，美国黑人在斗争中空前强烈地反对种族歧视，反对种族压迫，高呼“黑人要权力”的口号，明确地表达他们争取自身解放的决心。与此同时，他们积极投入了美国人民反对侵越战争的斗争，直接打击美帝国主义的侵略政策。为了有组织地开展这场斗争，美国各地黑人纷纷建立反对侵越战争的团体，今年三月，美国黑人还组成了“全国黑人反战反征兵联合会”。黑人群众的反战示威声势一次比一次浩大，他们响亮地喊出了“制止在越南进行的肮脏战争”的口号。
    美国黑人强烈反对美帝侵越战争还突出表现在许多黑人青年拒绝服兵役，烧毁征兵证，驱赶到黑人学校去搜罗炮灰的官员。黑人学生在这样的斗争中高喊：“美国才是黑人真正的战场！”不少已经入伍的黑人士兵，也不顾美帝国主义的“军法”，拒绝充当美帝国主义的杀人工具。驻在得克萨斯州的一些黑人士兵还曾经散发传单，宣传黑人必须反对侵略并起来革命的道理。被迫开往侵越战场上的黑人士兵也纷纷拒绝执行命令。许多黑人士兵还积极支持美国国内黑人的抗暴斗争，他们不断把枪支弹药寄回美国，武装自己的战友。据报道，最近克利夫兰黑人抗暴斗争中所使用的武器，有一些就是在越南的黑人士兵寄回去的。
    暴力压不倒，花招骗不了
    几年来，美国黑人斗争的猛烈风暴，都是在美帝国主义内外交困的情况下，在美国统治集团的心脏地区发生的，因此使美帝国主义者在政治上、经济上都遭到了格外沉重的打击。焦头烂额的美国统治当局，为了扑灭黑人斗争的烈火，加紧玩弄暴力镇压和政治欺骗的反革命两手策略，但是，美国黑人越战越强，暴力压不倒，花招骗不了。这是广大黑人群众英勇顽强的革命精神的突出表现。
    在黑人斗争的沉重打击下，美国反动统治集团经常出动“国民警卫队”镇压黑人。今年四月间美国黑人全国性抗暴斗争高潮时，约翰逊政府竟出动七万多名陆军和“国民警卫队”疯狂进行镇压。美联社也不得不承认“这在美国历史上是为对付平民的紧急事件而出动的最大的兵力”。美国国防部今年四月下旬又建立了控制“暴乱”的“特别指挥中心”和负责指挥镇压抗暴斗争的现役部队。美国陆军还把专门用来镇压人民斗争的七支“特遣部队”增至十二支。
    在加强法西斯镇压的同时，美国反动统治集团还加紧使用政治欺骗的伎俩。近几年来，美国统治当局年年都要大吹大擂地在白宫签署几项所谓的“民权法案”，妄图开出一些空头支票和利用一些小恩小惠来欺骗黑人群众，使他们放弃斗争。与此同时，美国反动统治阶级还在黑人中物色了少数统治阶级的走卒来担任法官、议员，甚至将军和市长，一方面借以装点门面，收买人心，一方面用以直接破坏黑人斗争。
    但是，无论是暴力镇压，还是政治欺骗，都无法阻止滚滚向前的黑人抗暴斗争的巨浪。今年四月席卷美国一百二十多个城市的黑人抗暴斗争怒潮刚过，今年夏天克利夫兰等地又响起了黑人抗暴斗争的枪声，而且就在克利夫兰和格里这两个由美国反动统治集团安插了黑人市长的地方，爆发了最激烈的黑人争取解放的斗争。克利夫兰市的黑人用机关枪等武器在通宵的激战里，击毙反动警察三人，击伤十九人。这表明黑人在不断提高抗暴斗争的水平。
    美国人民斗争的新号角
    在美帝国主义政治和经济危机不断发展的形势下，风起云涌的黑人斗争越来越有力地影响和推动着美国人民在其他方面的斗争，特别是进步学生的斗争。在美国学生运动中，黑人学生的斗争最英勇、最坚决，站在斗争的最前列。美国进步学生同反动当局的斗争，几乎都是首先发生在黑人大学或首先由黑人学生进行的。在黑人学生的促进下，美国进步学生运动最近几年来有了迅速发展。今年头五个月，美国就有一百多所大学爆发了罢课和游行示威。今年五月间爆发的纽约哥伦比亚大学学生反对种族歧视、反对侵越战争、反对政治迫害的大罢课，坚持了一个多月，震动了整个美国。这个学校的黑人学生和白人学生共同战斗，几次占领了学校的一些大楼，升起了红旗，扣押了教务长，搜查了校长办公室，并几次同前去镇压的数千名法西斯警察展开激烈的搏斗。
    在黑人抗暴斗争猛烈地冲击美国垄断资本集团的反动统治的同时，美国工人运动也蓬勃发展起来。从去年开始，美国的罢工浪潮此伏彼起，连绵不断，其声势和规模达到了十五年来的最高峰。值得指出的是，由于越来越多的黑人被迫移入城市，目前美国黑人中工人和失业工人已占了大多数，他们中间许多人积极参加了抗暴斗争，并把黑人抗暴斗争的战斗性带进了美国工人运动。去年七月纽波特纽斯船舶修建公司中运输部门的二百名黑人工人为抗议资本家强迫加班加点举行的罢工，迅速发展成为全厂两万名白人工人和黑人工人的联合大罢工，罢工工人同法西斯军警展开了激烈的搏斗。去年七月，底特律爆发大规模黑人抗暴斗争时，有大批贫苦的白人工人积极参加了这场斗争。这些迹象表明，美国黑人斗争必将逐步走向同美国工人运动相结合的正确道路。
    在美国黑人斗争蓬勃发展，美国劳动人民的斗争不断高涨的重要时刻，伟大的领袖毛主席在今年四月十六日又一次发表了支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明。毛主席指出：“美国黑人斗争必将同美国工人运动相结合，最终结束美国垄断资产阶级的罪恶统治。”毛主席发出了伟大的战斗号召：“全世界人民更紧密地团结起来，向着我们的共同敌人美帝国主义及其帮凶们发动持久的猛烈的进攻！”五年来，美国黑人争取解放的斗争浪潮，汹涌澎湃，勇往直前。全世界人民反对美帝国主义的熊熊烈火，越烧越旺。可以肯定，美帝国主义的反动统治是决不会长久的。（附图片）
