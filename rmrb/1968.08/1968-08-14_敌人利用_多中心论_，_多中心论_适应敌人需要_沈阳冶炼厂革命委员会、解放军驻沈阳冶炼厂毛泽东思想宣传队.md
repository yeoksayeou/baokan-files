The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Never forget class struggle." Vice Chairman Lin also warns us: "Class and class struggle are the root cause of all phenomena in class society." Looking at issues from the perspective of class struggle, the "multi-center theory" is a reactionary theory of the bourgeoisie, and in reality, it is hypocritical. It is either centered on the proletariat or centered on the bourgeoisie. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, class enemies deceive the masses, advocating for some "multi-center theory," which in essence is to have the bourgeoisie at the center, not the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao. A handful of class enemies vigorously spread the "multi-center theory," with the aim of disrupting Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, resisting the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, and attempting to save their doomed fate. We must be highly vigilant and never fall for the class enemy's tricks.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must be good at guiding the petty-bourgeois ideology within our ranks onto the revolutionary track of the proletariat. This is a key issue for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to achieve victory." The reactionary "multi-center theory" of the bourgeoisie, ultimately, is centered on the "self." The desperate class enemies use some people within our ranks who have serious bourgeois ideology, use the "multi-center theory" to sow discord, and struggle desperately, while bourgeois individualism and factionalism perfectly meet the needs of the class enemy.

Last spring, the broad masses of revolutionary proletarians in our factory, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, actively prepared for revolutionary great unity and the establishment of a revolutionary committee with three-in-one combination, when a handful of class enemies within the factory feared the victorious development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They adopted an offensive strategy, sowed discord, spread rumors, and used the bourgeois individualism, small-groupism, and sectarianism of some members of the revolutionary mass organizations to disrupt the great strategic deployment of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao. They split the originally united revolutionary mass organizations into three factions and even shouted for the establishment of "three revolutionary committees" and "three centers." The broad revolutionary masses throughout the factory promptly exposed the class enemy's evil plots and engaged in thorough exposure and resolute struggle, achieving revolutionary great unity and establishing the revolutionary committee, uniting the broad revolutionary masses firmly around the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao.

After the establishment of the factory revolutionary committee, the revolutionary proletarians in our factory, with a high sense of political responsibility as masters of the state, displayed great revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity, enthusiastically responding to Chairman Mao's great call, focusing on revolution and promoting production. This handful of class enemies, still unwilling to accept defeat, once again blatantly advocated for another production command team, attempting to obstruct the implementation of Chairman Mao's great directive to "grasp revolution and promote production." The revolutionary committee and the comrades of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed in the factory personally went to the production frontline. When raw materials were insufficient, they overcame numerous difficulties to secure raw materials and used every possible means to ensure the furnaces were well-fed; when production personnel were insufficient, they worked shifts with the workers to ensure normal production, effectively striking at the class enemies and educating the temporarily deceived masses. From these struggles, we deeply realized that in the struggle to achieve the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the greater our victories and the better the situation, the more the class enemies will try every means to sabotage and disrupt. Sometimes they appear in rightist guise, sometimes in ultra-"leftist" guise, fiercely opposing the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao. Within the revolutionary ranks, some people who never forget to establish their own factions and insist on some "me-centered" approach provide convenient conditions for the class enemies to carry out sabotage and disruption. Therefore, we must give a stern warning to those who are blinded by the "self," have swollen heads, and are keen on building factions and being "me-centered": the class enemies are using the "multi-center theory," and the "multi-center theory" is serving the class enemies. If they do not resolutely decide to thoroughly reform their bourgeois worldview with Mao Zedong Thought, it is very dangerous.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Communist Party of China is the leading core of the entire Chinese people. Without such a core, the cause of socialism cannot be victorious." Vice Chairman Lin instructs us: "Our country is a great socialist state under the dictatorship of the proletariat with a population of 700 million, which needs a unified, revolutionary, and correct thought, which is Mao Zedong Thought." In the past two years of intense class struggle, we have deeply realized that the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin is the only leadership center for the entire Party, the entire army, the entire country, and the broad revolutionary masses. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, by following this sole leadership center, we will definitely be invincible. We must be infinitely loyal to the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, absolutely obey the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, take the will of the proletarian headquarters as our own will, and forever follow and forever advance!

　　敌人利用“多中心论”，“多中心论”适应敌人需要

    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“千万不要忘记阶级斗争。”林副主席也告诫我们：“阶级和阶级斗争是阶级社会所有现象的总的根源。”用阶级斗争观点看问题，“多中心论”是资产阶级的反动理论，实际上是虚伪的。不是以无产阶级为中心，就是以资产阶级为中心。在无产阶级文化大革命中，阶级敌人欺骗群众，主张搞什么“多中心论”，实质上就是要资产阶级的中心，不要以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部这个唯一正确的领导中心。一小撮阶级敌人极力散布“多中心论”，其目的就是要破坏毛主席的伟大战略部署，反抗以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，妄图挽救他们灭亡的命运。我们应当高度警惕，切切不可上阶级敌人的当。
    毛主席教导我们：“必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道，这是无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的一个关键问题。”反动的资产阶级的
  “多中心论”，归根到底，就是以“私”字为中心。穷途末路的一小撮阶级敌人，就是利用我们队伍中的一些资产阶级思想严重的人，利用“多中心论”，挑拨离间，作垂死挣扎，而资产阶级个人主义、山头主义正好适应了阶级敌人的需要。
    去年春天，我们厂广大无产阶级革命派，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，积极准备实现革命的大联合和建立三结合的革命委员会时，厂内一小撮阶级敌人害怕无产阶级文化大革命形势的胜利发展，他们采取以攻为守的策略，挑拨离间，造谣生事，竭力利用革命群众组织一些成员的资产阶级个人主义、小团体主义、宗派主义等，破坏毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的伟大战略部署，把原来统一的革命群众组织分裂成为三派，并且叫嚷要成立“三个革命委员会”，立“三个中心”。全厂广大革命群众，及时识破了阶级敌人的罪恶阴谋，进行了彻底的揭露和坚决的斗争，实现了革命大联合，成立起革命委员会，把广大革命群众紧紧地团结在以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的周围。
    在厂革命委员会成立后，我们厂无产阶级革命派，以国家主人翁的高度政治责任感，发挥极大的革命积极性和创造精神，热烈响应毛主席的伟大号召，狠抓革命，猛促生产，这一小撮阶级敌人仍然不甘心于失败，又一次明目张胆地鼓吹要另搞一套生产指挥班子，妄图阻挠毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示的落实。我们革命委员会和驻厂毛泽东思想宣传队的同志就亲自到生产第一线。原材料不足，就克服重重困难搞原材料，想尽一切办法让炉子吃饱；生产人员不足，就和工人一起顶班劳动，使生产正常进行，有力地打击了阶级敌人，教育了一时受蒙蔽的群众。我们从这些斗争实践中深刻地认识到：在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的斗争中，我们的胜利越大，形势越好，阶级敌人越要千方百计地进行破坏和捣乱，他们有时以右的、有时又以极“左”的面目出现，疯狂反对以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部。在革命队伍中，有的人念念不忘立自己的山头，坚持要搞什么“以我为中心”，就正好给阶级敌人进行破坏捣乱提供了方便条件。因此，我们要向被“私”字迷了心窍，头脑膨胀，热衷于搞山头，搞“以我为中心”的人大喝一声：阶级敌人正在利用“多中心论”，“多中心论”在为阶级敌人服务，如果不痛下决心，用毛泽东思想彻底改造自己的资产阶级世界观，那是很危险的。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“中国共产党是全中国人民的领导核心。没有这样一个核心，社会主义事业就不能胜利。”林副主席指示我们：“我国是一个伟大的无产阶级专政的社会主义国家，有七亿人口，需要有一个统一的思想，革命的思想，正确的思想，这就是毛泽东思想。”在两年来激烈的阶级搏斗中，我们深刻地认识到：以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部是全党全军全国和广大革命群众唯一的领导中心。在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们紧跟这个唯一的领导中心，就一定能攻无不克，战无不胜。我们要无限忠于毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，绝对服从以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，以无产阶级司令部的意志为自己的意志，永远紧跟，永远前进！
