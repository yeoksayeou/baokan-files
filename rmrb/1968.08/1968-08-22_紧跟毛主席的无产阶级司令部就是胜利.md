The core force leading our cause is the Chinese Communist Party. The theoretical foundation guiding our thoughts is Marxism-Leninism. The proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin is the sole leadership center for the entire Party, the entire army, the entire nation, and all revolutionary masses. Over the past two years, hundreds of millions of military and civilian personnel across the country have, under the command of Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters, closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, thoroughly smashed the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev, and achieved decisive victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Reflecting on our experience in carrying out the task of supporting the left at the Qingdao Mold Factory, we deeply feel that the proletarian headquarters led by the great leader Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin most concentratedly represents the fundamental interests of the proletariat and all revolutionary masses. Every battle command issued by it is a guiding beacon for our victory. Only by closely uniting around Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters and following the great strategic deployment of the great leader Chairman Mao, and fully implementing Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, can we thoroughly smash all the tricks and schemes of the class enemy and achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

When the great leader Chairman Mao issued the latest instruction that "holding study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes," we immediately responded and set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes throughout the company. With "criticizing and repudiating revisionism and criticizing and repudiating oneself" as the key link, we further developed and consolidated the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination. At this time, a handful of class enemies sensed that the full implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions would mean their complete annihilation. They used bourgeois factionalism to incite and deceive some of the masses, formed their own factions, and advocated the erroneous idea of "taking myself as the core," attempting to split the revolutionary ranks and achieve their evil goal of sabotaging the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination. Faced with this situation, we organized the broad revolutionary masses in the study classes to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's latest instructions and related teachings, such as "within the proletariat, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the proletariat to split into two irreconcilable factions." We thoroughly criticized the fallacy of "taking myself as the core," making everyone further see clearly that "taking myself as the core" is a bourgeois reactionary thought, a variant of the already discredited factionalism and sectarianism. The broad revolutionary masses resolved to strengthen unity and jointly oppose the enemy, thus foiling the class enemy's tricks and schemes and consolidating the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination.

"Even if the tree wants to be still, the wind will not cease." The class enemy, failing in one scheme, comes up with another. After the revolutionary committee was established, they spread the idea that "the current main contradiction is between the revolutionary committee and the revolutionary mass organizations" and "the revolutionary committee cannot lead the mass organizations, which should have their own independence." Obviously, this is a rehash of the fallacy of "taking myself as the core." As soon as this fallacy surfaced, we immediately organized everyone in the study classes to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's teachings on the revolutionary committee, timely exposing the class enemy's evil plot to drive a wedge between the revolutionary committee and the mass organizations and sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We further strengthened the unity between the revolutionary committee and the mass organizations on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, ensuring the implementation of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, and once again foiled the class enemy's ferocious attack, achieving double victories in revolution and production throughout the company.

The practice of revolutionary struggle has educated us, making us realize that the reactionary "multi-center means no center" theory is an expression of bourgeois individualism. If everyone takes themselves as the center, who knows how many centers there would be in the country, actually meaning there is no center. The essence of the "multi-center" theory is to abolish the center and sabotage the sole correct leadership center led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. This is a rightist, splitist slogan that must be thoroughly criticized.

We are proletarian revolutionary warriors who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and infinitely loyal to the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao. We must closely unite around the proletarian headquarters, resolutely carry out and thoroughly implement the commands from the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao. Under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters, we will unify our thinking, unify our steps, and unify our actions to achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    紧跟毛主席的无产阶级司令部就是胜利
    海军某部驻青岛工模具公司支左小组
      “领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党。”“指导我们思想的理论基础是马克思列宁主义。”以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，是全党、全军、全国和广大革命群众唯一的领导中心。两年来，全国亿万军民在毛主席的无产阶级司令部的号令下，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，彻底摧垮了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，取得了无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利。
    回顾我们在青岛工模具公司担负支左任务的实践，同志们深深体会到：以伟大领袖毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，最集中地代表了无产阶级和广大革命群众的根本利益，它发出的每一个战斗号令，都是引导我们胜利前进的指路明灯。只有紧紧地团结在毛主席的无产阶级司令部的周围，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席一系列最新指示，才能彻底粉碎阶级敌人的一切阴谋诡计，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    当伟大领袖毛主席发出“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的最新指示的时候，我们闻风而动，立刻在全公司办起了毛泽东思想学习班，以“斗私，批修”为纲，进一步发展和巩固了革命的大联合和革命的三结合。这时，一小撮阶级敌人预感到毛主席最新指示的全面落实就是他们的彻底灭亡，就利用资产阶级的派性，煽动和蒙蔽一部分群众，拉起队伍，另立山头，极力鼓吹“以我为核心”的错误思想，妄图分裂革命队伍，以达到破坏革命大联合和革命三结合的罪恶目的。面对这种情况，我们在学习班里，组织广大革命群众，反复学习了毛主席“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织”的最新指示和有关教导，彻底批判了“以我为核心”的谬论，使大家进一步看清了“以我为核心”是资产阶级反动思想，是已经搞臭了的山头主义、宗派主义的变种。广大革命群众决心加强团结，共同对敌，从而粉碎了阶级敌人的阴谋诡计，巩固了革命的大联合和革命的三结合。
      “树欲静而风不止”。阶级敌人一计不成又生一计。在革命委员会成立以后，他们又散布“当前主要矛盾是革命委员会和革命群众组织之间的矛盾”、“革委会不能领导群众组织，群众组织应该有自己的独立性”。显然，这是“以我为核心”谬论的翻版。这种谬论一出笼，我们就在学习班里，立即组织大家反复学习了毛主席有关革命委员会的教导，及时戳穿了阶级敌人妄图离间革命委员会和群众组织之间的关系，破坏无产阶级文化大革命的罪恶阴谋，更加加强了革命委员会和群众组织在毛泽东思想基础上的团结，有力地保证了毛主席一系列最新指示的贯彻落实，又一次粉碎了阶级敌人的猖狂进攻，全公司取得了革命和生产的双胜利。
    革命斗争的实践教育了我们，使我们认识到：反动的
  “多中心即无中心论”，是资产阶级唯我主义的表现。如果大家都以自己为中心，全国就不知道要出现多少个中心，实际上就是没有中心。“多中心论”的实质，就是要取消中心，破坏以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的唯一正确的领导中心。这是一个右倾分裂主义的口号，必须彻底批判。
    我们是无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级司令部的无产阶级革命战士。我们一定要紧紧地团结在无产阶级司令部的周围，对来自毛主席的无产阶级司令部的号令坚决照办，彻底执行，在无产阶级司令部的领导下，统一认识，统一步伐，统一行动，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
