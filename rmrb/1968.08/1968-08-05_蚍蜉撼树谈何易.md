The revolutionary oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan" is a brilliant flower radiating the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. It successfully depicts the glorious image of our great leader Mao Zedong in his youth with a high level of ideological content and outstanding artistic creation. This work is a magnificent epic written by us Red Guards with our brushes to express our boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to our great leader Chairman Mao. It is a majestic hymn composed with colors.

"Remembering the past, the years were thick with events," the Red Guards have just stepped onto the political stage of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. With great revolutionary heroism, they have raised high the banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against the reactionaries," smashed the "Four Olds," and established the "Four News." They have taken up their pens as swords and declared war on the old world.

In the storm of class struggle and in the process of integrating with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, we have deeply felt the boundless love of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers for Chairman Mao and their deep hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev. Armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, under the leadership of Comrade Jiang Qing, we have marched forward bravely. The revolutionary oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan" was born in the repeated struggles against the counter-revolutionary revisionist line pursued by the Chinese Khrushchev. Its birth is a great victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line of literature and art! It is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought! Every stroke of the brush is filled with the boundless love of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers for Chairman Mao, and every stroke is condensed with intense hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev. The revolutionary oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan" speaks the hearts of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. The hundreds of millions of revolutionary people across the country, holding the revolutionary oil painting, gazing at the glorious image of Chairman Mao, further ignite their deep class feelings of loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They are filled with enthusiasm and tears of joy, shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" The cheers shake the heavens and the earth. The revolutionary oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan" is excellent! It is excellent!

How can a fly understand the aspirations of an eagle? Our victory is the enemy's defeat! The birth of the revolutionary oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan" has made a small group of class enemies at home and abroad panic-stricken. Among the wails of these flies hitting the wall, the Soviet revisionist clowns are particularly vocal. They fabricated all kinds of shameless lies and launched vicious attacks, slandering the high evaluation of the revolutionary oil painting by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in our country as "adding branches and leaves," and slandering the enthusiastic acclaim of the hundreds of millions of revolutionary people across the country for the revolutionary oil painting as "shouting at the top of their lungs" to "propagate." This is utterly absurd!

What "adding branches and leaves"! The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in our country love this revolutionary oil painting and give it a high evaluation precisely because it expresses in artistic language the boundless love of hundreds of millions of revolutionary people for Chairman Mao. The revolutionary oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan" is good precisely because it expresses the love of the revolutionary people for Chairman Mao and deals a fatal blow to the Chinese Khrushchev. Our great leader Chairman Mao is the pioneer of the Chinese workers' movement. Chairman Mao personally ignited the revolutionary spark of the Anshan workers' movement, but the old opportunist, great traitor, and great scoundrel Chinese Khrushchev, with the evil intention of usurping the party and the country, has long disguised himself as the "leader" of the workers' movement. The oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan" is like a heavy artillery shell that completely topples the "monument" of the Chinese Khrushchev and tears off his "old revolutionary" mask. This revolutionary oil painting is good precisely because it restores the history of the Anshan workers' movement, which has been turned upside down. It greatly boosts the morale of the proletariat and greatly demoralizes the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries!

This oil painting is a profound and powerful criticism of the Chinese Khrushchev. Birds of a feather flock together, and people of the same ilk gather. No wonder the Soviet revisionists are so eager to attack us. It is clear that the Chinese Khrushchev and the Soviet revisionist clowns are of the same ilk.

The revolutionary oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan" has just been born and has already shown the powerful vitality and great combat effectiveness of proletarian new literature and art. It is like a thriving pine tree, lush and vigorous, with dense branches and leaves! Soviet revisionist clowns, we will not only add a branch or a leaf, we Red Guards are determined to let the pine tree of proletarian new literature and art grow into a dense forest, and we will not rest until we achieve this goal! We are firmly convinced that our goal will be achieved, and our goal will definitely be achieved!

What "shouting at the top of their lungs" to "propagate"! The Soviet revisionist clowns' frenzied attacks on this revolutionary oil painting are entirely out of their class nature and their deep hatred for Mao Zedong Thought. Soviet revisionist traitors, let me tell you: Chairman Mao is the red sun in the hearts of the revolutionary people, and Mao Zedong Thought is the lighthouse illuminating the road to victory for the revolutionary people of the world. Anyone who opposes Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought will be smashed to pieces! We Red Guards have the reddest hearts and the brightest eyes, forever following Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Chairman Mao. Singing the praises of our great leader Chairman Mao, singing the praises of the revolutionary leader of the world proletariat Chairman Mao, is our greatest happiness and also the most sublime and glorious mission bestowed upon us by history.

Regarding culture and art, different classes have always had different standpoints and views. Our proletarian art is a powerful weapon for "uniting the people, educating the people, attacking the enemy, and annihilating the enemy," while the art of all exploiting classes is entirely for the purpose of exploiting the people, deceiving the people, numbing the people, and enslaving the people. In a word, it is to maintain their reactionary rule.

We warn the Soviet revisionist traitors: you have no right to comment on proletarian art. You have been busy restoring capitalism in the Soviet Union. To maintain your bourgeois reactionary rule, you have long turned Soviet literature and art into tools to corrupt the Soviet people with pornography and theft, advocate traitor philosophy, promote selfishness, and spread various revisionist poisons. You have opened the floodgates for the most reactionary, most decadent, and most degenerate art of Western bourgeoisie to flood the Soviet Union. Those works that advocate Sino-American cooperation to rule the world, propagate pacifism and war terror, and other rubbish, have filled the exhibition halls of today's Soviet Union. No wonder the Western bourgeoisie praises you, saying: "Soviet art forms and techniques have become diversified." "The Soviet Union is advancing on the great road of Westernization." You traitors are so flattered!

In today's Soviet Union, those revolutionary paintings and excellent artworks that reflect the great October Revolution and the early Soviet period have long been buried, some destroyed, some banished to the cold palace, some wantonly distorted and altered, the glorious images of Stalin, Sverdlov, and Dzerzhinsky have been brutally erased from the canvas. What is particularly despicable is that the Soviet revisionist group held a so-called "photographic exhibition in memory of the October Revolution" in Moscow last year, actually placing photographs of the great Lenin's glorious image alongside pornographic photographs. This is a great insult to the great revolutionary leader Lenin and also an insult to the great revolutionary people of the Soviet Union! Look, how far the Soviet revisionist traitors have fallen!

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "There is no love without reason, nor hatred without reason." The broad masses of the Soviet people absolutely cannot tolerate the despicable deeds of the Brezhnev and Kosygin clique, and they have protested in droves against the Soviet magazines publishing vulgar bourgeois works, condemning reactionary writers for shamelessly praising nude paintings in newspapers. They angrily say: "This is the root cause of young people's unrestrained, licentious, and obscene behavior!" It is "immoral to corrupt the youth," "shameful!" However, the Brezhnev and Kosygin traitor clique viciously slander the broad masses of the Soviet people as "ignorant," shouting: "If you don't understand, then don't comment." What a typical bourgeois aristocrat's attitude! You love the decadent lifestyle of the bourgeoisie and hate proletarian revolution and the broad laboring people, isn't this clear?

The Soviet revisionist traitor clique has been terrified by the earth-shaking Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. You have fiercely attacked the eight model revolutionary operas that drove the emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties off the stage, and today you are trying to erase the great political influence and epoch-making achievements of the revolutionary oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan." Marx once mocked the opportunists like Proudhon, saying: When they "feel their arguments are hollow, so much so that they suddenly lose their composure and become angry... howling, going crazy, cursing, swearing, pounding their chests, and slamming the table." This is a vivid and accurate description! Soviet revisionist traitors! Aren't you also making a fool of yourselves today?

"The ant struggles to shake a tree, how difficult it is." The more the enemy curses and wails, the more it proves the combat effectiveness of proletarian literature and art, and the more it proves that our path is correct.

Comrade Lin Biao pointed out: "The people's revolution under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought is the locomotive of historical progress." Revolution is not only a powerful driving force for the development of productive forces but also a powerful driving force for the development of culture and art. The birth of the revolutionary oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan" heralds that a new era of unprecedented prosperity in socialist culture and art is about to arrive after the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

We Red Guards will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, follow Chairman Mao closely, and firmly walk the revolutionary path indicated by Chairman Mao. The attacks and slanders of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique are nothing but the antics of clowns!

Unfolding the magnificent historical scroll of "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan," the towering image of Chairman Mao stands before us, and the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought shines like a red sun, illuminating the globe.

The revolutionary oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan" expresses the boundless affection of the hundreds of millions of revolutionary people across the country. It is excellent! Let us cheer for it even more enthusiastically!

　　蚍蜉撼树谈何易
　　中央工艺美术学院红卫兵　辛怀戈
    革命油画《毛主席去安源》，是一朵闪烁着毛泽东思想光辉的鲜花。它以高度的思想水平和优秀的艺术创造，成功地描绘出了我们伟大领袖毛主席青年时代的光辉形象。这幅作品是我们红卫兵为了表达对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚，用画笔写成的壮丽的史诗，用色彩谱成的雄伟的赞歌。
      “忆往昔峥嵘岁月稠”，红卫兵刚刚登上无产阶级文化大革命的政治舞台，就以大无畏的革命英雄气概，高举“对反动派造反有理”的大旗，大破“四旧”，大立“四新”，拿起笔做刀枪，向旧世界宣战。
    在阶级斗争的暴风雨中，在和工农兵相结合的过程中，我们深深地体会到了广大工农兵对毛主席的无限热爱，对中国赫鲁晓夫的无比仇恨。我们以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，在江青同志率领下，奋勇前进。革命油画《毛主席去安源》，就是在同中国赫鲁晓夫所推行的反革命修正主义路线的反复斗争中诞生的。她的诞生是毛主席革命文艺路线的伟大胜利！是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！油画的每一笔都饱蘸着广大工农兵群众对毛主席的无限热爱，每一笔都凝聚着对中国赫鲁晓夫的强烈憎恨。革命油画《毛主席去安源》说出了工农兵群众的心里话。全国亿万革命人民，手捧着革命油画，瞻仰着毛主席的光辉形象，进一步激发起无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的深厚阶级感情。他们豪情满怀、喜泪盈眶，“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”“敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！”的欢呼声，震天撼地。革命油画《毛主席去安源》好得很！好极了！
    苍蝇怎懂得雄鹰的志向？我们的胜利就是敌人的失败！革命油画《毛主席去安源》的诞生，使国内外一小撮阶级敌人惊慌失措。在这群碰壁苍蝇的抽泣声中，苏修小丑叫得特别卖力。他们编造了种种无耻的鬼话，进行了种种恶毒的攻击，诬蔑我国广大工农兵群众对革命油画的高度评价，是什么“添枝加叶”，诬蔑全国亿万革命人民热烈欢呼革命油画，是什么“声嘶力竭”的“宣扬”。真是混账透顶！
    什么“添枝加叶”！我国广大工农兵群众所以热爱这一幅革命油画，并给予她高度评价，就是因为她用艺术语言，集中地概括了亿万革命人民对毛主席无限热爱的思想感情。革命油画《毛主席去安源》，好就好在她表达了革命人民对毛主席的热爱，好就好在她给予中国赫鲁晓夫致命的打击。我们伟大领袖毛主席是中国工人运动的开拓者。毛主席亲手点燃了安源工人运动的革命火种，但是老机会主义者、大叛徒、大工贼中国赫鲁晓夫，却抱着篡党、篡国的罪恶目的，长期以来把自己打扮成工人运动的“领袖”。油画《毛主席去安源》象一颗重型炮弹，彻底掀倒了中国赫鲁晓夫的“功德碑”，撕碎了他的“老革命”的画皮。这幅革命油画，好就好在她把被颠倒了的安源工人运动的历史，重新颠倒过来。她大长了无产阶级的志气，大灭了帝修反的威风！
    这幅革命油画，是对中国赫鲁晓夫的一次深刻有力的批判。物以类聚，人以群分。难怪苏修这样卖劲地攻击我们。真是打在中国赫鲁晓夫身上，痛在苏修叛徒集团心上。我们由此更加看得清楚，中国赫鲁晓夫和苏修小丑完全是一丘之貉。
    革命油画《毛主席去安源》刚刚诞生，就显示出了无产阶级新文艺的强大生命力和巨大的战斗作用。她犹如一棵茁壮的青松，郁郁葱葱，蓬勃旺盛，她的枝叶茂密得很哩！苏修小丑们，我们何止要添一枝、加一叶，我们红卫兵决心要让无产阶级新文艺的青松，长成茂密的大森林，不达此目的，决不罢休！我们坚信，我们的目的一定要达到，我们的目的一定能够达到！
    什么“声嘶力竭”的“宣扬”！苏修小丑疯狂攻击这幅革命油画，完全是出于他们的阶级本性，出于对毛泽东思想的刻骨仇恨。苏修叛徒，老实告诉你们：毛主席是革命人民心中的红太阳，毛泽东思想是照亮全世界革命人民胜利道路的灯塔。谁反对毛主席、反对毛泽东思想，谁就要碰得头破血流！我们红卫兵心最红、眼最亮，永远紧跟毛主席，永远忠于毛主席。歌颂我们伟大领袖毛主席，歌颂世界无产阶级的革命导师毛主席，是我们最大的幸福，也是历史赋予我们最崇高、最光荣的使命。
    对于文化艺术，从来是不同阶级有不同的立场和观点的，我们无产阶级的艺术，是“团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器”，而一切剥削阶级，他们的艺术完全是为着剥削人民、欺骗人民、麻醉人民、奴役人民，一句话，就是为了维护自己的反动统治。
    正告苏修叛徒：你们根本就没有资格对无产阶级的艺术指手划脚，你们在苏联国内大搞资本主义复辟。为了维护你们的资产阶级反动统治，你们早就把苏联的文学艺术变成了诲淫诲盗、宣扬叛徒哲学、鼓吹利己主义、散布种种修正主义毒素的腐蚀苏联人民的工具。你们为西方资产阶级最反动、最腐朽、最没落的艺术在苏联的泛滥，开了闸门。那些鼓吹苏美合作主宰世界、宣扬和平主义和战争恐怖，以及其他乌七八糟的“作品”，塞满了当今苏联的展览馆。难怪西方资产阶级称赞你们说：“苏联美术形式和手法多样化了”。“苏联正在西欧化的大道上前进”。苏修这伙无耻的叛徒们，你们该是何等地受宠若惊啊！
    在今天的苏联，那些反映伟大的十月革命和苏维埃早期的革命绘画和优秀的艺术品，早已湮没了，有的被毁掉、有的被打入冷宫、有的被恣意歪曲和篡改，斯大林、斯维尔德洛夫、捷尔任斯基的光辉形象，从画布上被横暴地抹掉了。尤其可恨的是，苏修集团去年在莫斯科举办的一个所谓“纪念十月革命节”的摄影图片展览会里，竟然把伟大列宁光辉形象的照片同黄色照片摆在一起。这是对伟大革命导师列宁的莫大污辱，也是对苏联广大革命人民的污辱！看，苏修叛徒已经堕落到何等地步！
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“世上决没有无缘无故的爱，也没有无缘无故的恨。”苏联广大人民是绝对不能容忍勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流的卑鄙行径的，他们纷纷抗议苏修杂志刊登资产阶级低级下流的“作品”，谴责反动文人在报刊上无耻地吹捧裸体画。他们愤怒地说：“这就是青年为所欲为、放荡不羁、下流猥亵的根源！”是“不道德地腐蚀青年”，“可耻！”然而，勃列日涅夫、柯西金叛徒集团却破口大骂苏联广大人民是“无知之徒”，叫嚷：“要是不懂得，那么就别发表意见。”真是一副资产阶级贵族老爷的嘴脸！你们爱的是资产阶级的糜烂的生活方式，恨的是无产阶级革命和广大的劳动人民，这不是昭然若揭了吗！
    苏修叛徒集团早已被惊天动地的中国无产阶级文化大革命吓得魂不附体。你们大肆攻击过把帝王将相、才子佳人赶下舞台的八个革命样板戏，今天你们又企图抹煞革命油画《毛主席去安源》的巨大政治影响和艺术上划时代的成就。马克思在嘲笑机会主义者普鲁东之流时曾经说过：当他们“感到自己论据空空洞洞，如此感到完全无力谈论这一切东西，以致突然忘形地恼怒起来……嚎叫，发疯发狂，肆口谩骂，指天画日，赌咒发誓，捶胸拍案”。真揭露得生动极了！形象极了！苏修叛徒们！你们今天不也正是这样丑态百出吗？
    “蚍蜉撼树谈何易”。敌人越是咒骂和哀鸣，就越证明无产阶级文艺的战斗作用，越证明我们的道路是走对了。
    林彪副主席指出：“毛泽东思想指引下的人民革命是历史前进的火车头。”革命不但是发展社会生产力的强大动力，而且也是发展文化艺术的强大动力。革命油画《毛主席去安源》的诞生预示着，经过无产阶级文化大革命，社会主义文化艺术空前繁荣的新时代即将到来！
    我们红卫兵永远忠于毛主席，紧跟毛主席，坚定地走毛主席所指引的革命道路，苏修叛徒集团的攻击和诬蔑，都只不过是小丑跳梁而已！
    展开《毛主席去安源》这幅光辉夺目的伟大历史画卷，毛主席顶天立地的伟大形象屹立在我们面前，伟大的、战无不胜的毛泽东思想，有如一轮红日，照亮了全球。
    革命油画《毛主席去安源》表达了全国亿万革命人民的无限深情。她就是好极了！让我们更加热烈地欢呼她吧！
