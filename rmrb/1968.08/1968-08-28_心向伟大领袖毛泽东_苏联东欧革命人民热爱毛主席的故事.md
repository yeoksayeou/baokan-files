Our great leader Chairman Mao says: "The people of all countries, who make up more than 90 percent of the world's population, are bound to rise in revolution and will support Marxism-Leninism. They will not support revisionism; some may temporarily support it, but they will eventually discard it."

The people of the Soviet Union under the rule of the Soviet revisionist renegade clique, and the people of Eastern European countries under the rule of modern revisionist cliques, are bound to rise in revolution. They are gradually seeing through the traitorous faces of modern revisionism centered around the Soviet revisionist leadership, and are awakening day by day. They love Chairman Mao, the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, and express their determination to overcome all difficulties, to study and apply the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, to rise up and smash the rule of modern revisionism, and to seize power back into the hands of the proletariat and revolutionary people.

In a foreign port, a Soviet sailor who had participated in the Great Patriotic War saw a Chinese distant-sea cargo ship also docked in the same port. He found an opportunity to board the Chinese ship. As soon as he got on board, he told the Chinese sailors, "I am here to find our true friends among the Soviet people to have a heart-to-heart talk!" He told the Chinese sailors that he had served under the great leader of the Soviet people, Stalin, for over a decade and had participated in the Great Patriotic War. Now, all the Soviet people love and miss Stalin and hate Khrushchev, Brezhnev, and Kosygin.

The Soviet sailor went on to say: In the past, Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin led the world's people in revolution. Today, it is the great teacher Chairman Mao who is leading the world's people in revolution. Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. After a moment of reflection, he clenched his fist and said: The power in the Soviet Union has been usurped by Khrushchev, Brezhnev, and Kosygin, but our heroic Soviet people will not yield. We will definitely carry out a second October Revolution and seize power back.

The Chinese ship "Jining" was docked in a Polish port. For several days, more than a dozen Polish sailors came aboard the "Jining," watched Chinese films and magazines, asked Chinese sailors to introduce the situation of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and requested that Chinese sailors give them copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and Mao badges. They said: We long for China because China has the great leader Mao Zedong. When they saw in the film the great leader Chairman Mao receiving the Red Guards and revolutionary masses, these Polish sailors were very excited and repeatedly shouted, "Long live Mao Zedong! Down with Khrushchev! Down with Gomułka!" This incident was known to their superiors, and one sailor was beaten badly, but the sailors still broke through the obstacles and, at the risk of their lives, found ways to come to the "Jining" to pay homage to the great leader Chairman Mao's glorious image. One sailor told the Chinese comrades that he would definitely be put in solitary confinement and punished with hard labor when he returned, but he was not afraid at all. Before leaving, he asked the Chinese sailors for a precious souvenir and shouted, "Long live Mao Zedong!" as he left the "Jining." Once, a Polish sailor obtained a Mao badge and tightly held the hand of a Chinese comrade, saying: We miss Chairman Mao very much. Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, and we place our hope for revolutionary victory on Chairman Mao. The Polish people, the Chinese people, and the revolutionary people of all countries will definitely defeat imperialism and modern revisionism because the truth is on our side.

The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the strongest ideological weapon against imperialism and revisionism. The revolutionary people under the rule of modern revisionism in Eastern European countries are eager to obtain the Little Red Book "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and to study Mao Zedong Thought. In a Chinese port, there are often passengers from the Soviet Union, Poland, East Germany, Bulgaria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and other countries. In a rest room of this port, there are "Quotations from Chairman Mao," Mao badges, bookmarks with Mao's quotations and portrait, photographs, and magazines displayed for passengers to read and take freely. In one month, more than a hundred passengers from these countries took more than 1,300 items. One day, in a Chinese civil aviation waiting room's bank, a Czechoslovakian friend came, who seemed to be there to exchange currency, but he stood there without moving. When the person monitoring him left, he told the Chinese comrades that he was waiting there not for any other reason but to obtain the Little Red Book "Quotations from Chairman Mao." When his request was fulfilled, he said in not very fluent Chinese, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!" An old Yugoslav sailor, after receiving a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" from a Chinese border inspector, said: We are eager to obtain the Little Red Book. We will follow Chairman Mao's teaching of "It is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries" and rebel against the Tito renegade clique. A friend from East Germany under the rule of the Ulbricht clique finally obtained a German version of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." As soon as he got the book, he opened the cover page and gazed at the portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao for a long time, saying to the Chinese comrades with deep affection, that his family was very poor and could not even light an electric lamp, and every night he had to study under the streetlight. He said, I will definitely study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought well, master the anti-revisionist weapon, and learn from the Chinese Red Guards to rebel against modern revisionism. A Soviet old sailor in a Chinese port, after obtaining a Russian version of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," said excitedly: I am so happy! I am so happy! Our hearts are with Beijing, our hearts are with the great leader Mao Zedong! I firmly believe that the days of the modern revisionist leadership clique are numbered and will not last long.

    心向伟大领袖毛泽东
    ——苏联东欧革命人民热爱毛主席的故事
    我们伟大领袖毛主席说：“各国的人民，占人口总数的百分之九十以上的人民大众，总是要革命的，总是会拥护马克思列宁主义的。他们不会拥护修正主义，有些人暂时拥护，将来终究会抛弃它。”
    苏修叛徒集团统治下的苏联人民，现代修正主义集团统治下的东欧国家的人民，是要革命的。他们逐渐看清了以苏修领导集团为中心的现代修正主义的叛徒面目，正在一天天地觉醒起来；他们无限热爱当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛主席，表示要排除一切困难，努力学习和运用战无不胜的毛泽东思想，奋起大造现代修正主义统治的反，把政权重新掌握在无产阶级和革命人民手里。
    在一个外国某港口，一个参加过卫国战争的苏联海员，看到中国的一艘远洋货轮也停泊在这个港口，便找机会来到中国货轮上。他一上船，就对中国海员说：“我是来找我们苏联人民的真正朋友，说说知心话的！”他告诉中国海员，他跟着苏联人民的伟大领袖斯大林当过十几年兵，参加过卫国战争。现在，全苏联人民热爱斯大林，怀念斯大林，痛恨赫鲁晓夫、勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流。
    这位苏联海员又说：过去马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林领导世界人民闹革命，今天是伟大的导师毛主席领导着世界人民闹革命。毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。他沉思了片刻，挥动着捏紧的拳头说：我们苏联的政权被赫鲁晓夫、勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流篡夺了，但是我们英雄的苏联人民决不屈服，一定要进行第二次十月革命，把政权夺回来。
    中国“济宁”号轮船停在波兰一个港口。一连几天，十几个波兰水兵来到“济宁”号轮船上，看中国电影和画报，请中国海员给他们介绍中国无产阶级文化大革命情况，并要求中国海员赠送他们《毛主席语录》，毛主席像章。他们说：我们非常向往中国，因为中国有伟大领袖毛泽东。当他们从电影中看到伟大领袖毛主席接见红卫兵小将和广大革命群众时，这些波兰水兵非常激动，不断高呼“万岁，毛泽东！”“打倒赫鲁晓夫！”“打倒哥穆尔卡！”这件事被他们的头目知道了，有个水兵被毒打了一顿，但是水兵们仍然冲破阻挠，冒着危险，想法到“济宁”号上来，瞻仰伟大领袖毛主席的光辉形象。一个水兵告诉中国同志，他回去后肯定要被关禁闭、罚苦役，但他一点也不怕。临走时，他向中国海员要了一件珍贵的纪念品，高呼“毛泽东万岁！”离开了“济宁”号。有一次，一个波兰海员得到一枚毛主席像章，他紧紧握着中国同志的手说：我们非常想念毛主席。毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，我们把革命胜利的希望寄托在毛主席身上。波兰人民、中国人民和各国革命人民必将战胜帝国主义和现代修正主义，因为真理在我们这一边。
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想，是反帝反修的最强大的思想武器。在现代修正主义统治下的东欧国家的革命人民，渴望得到红色宝书《毛主席语录》，渴望学习毛泽东思想。中国有个港口，经常接待过境的苏联、波兰、东德、保加利亚、匈牙利、捷克斯洛伐克等国家的旅客。在这个港口的一个休息室里，陈列着供旅客们自由阅读和索取的《毛主席语录》、毛主席像章、印有毛主席语录和毛主席画像的书签、照片及画报，在一个月内，这些国家有上百名旅客，索取了一千三百多件。一天，在中国一个民航候机室的银行营业所前，来了一个捷克斯洛伐克朋友，看起来他是来兑换人民币的，可是他一直站在那里等着没有动静，等到监视他的家伙走了，他才告诉中国同志，他等在这里不为别的，很希望得到红色宝书《毛主席语录》，当他的要求得到满足后，他用不太熟练的中国话，激动地说：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”一个南斯拉夫老海员从我边防检查员手中得到一本《毛主席语录》后说：我们渴望得到红色宝书。我们要按照毛主席“对反动派造反有理”的教导，造铁托叛徒集团的反。在乌布利希集团统治下的一个东德朋友，终于得到了一本德文版《毛主席语录》，他一拿到宝书，就打开扉页，久久凝视伟大领袖毛主席的画像，无限深情地对中国同志说，他家里很穷，连电灯都点不起，每天晚上只能在街灯下学习。他说，我一定好好学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，掌握好反修武器，学习中国红卫兵，造现代修正主义的反。一个苏联老海员在中国某港口，得到了一本俄文版《毛主席语录》，他非常激动地说：我太幸福了！我太幸福了！我们的心向着北京，我们的心向着伟大领袖毛泽东！我坚信，现代修正主义领导集团的日子越来越不好过，他们的寿命不长了。
