Edition: 5

The revolutionary symphony "Shajiabang" presents a grand and powerful spectacle, passionately singing the praises of the great thoughts of Chairman Mao, deeply portraying the great people's war, and successfully creating the brilliant image of the working-class, peasant, and soldier masses nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. The creators of human history—the working-class, peasant, and soldier masses—have for the first time taken the stage of symphonic music!

This is a revolutionary milestone in the history of world symphonic music!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "If you are a bourgeois artist, you will not sing the praises of the proletariat but of the bourgeoisie; if you are a proletarian artist, you will not sing the praises of the bourgeoisie but of the proletariat and the laboring people. One of the two must be chosen."

Looking through the history of bourgeois symphonic music, in that mountain of scores, is there a single note that has ever sung the praises of the creators of human history—the people? Is there a single movement that has ever sung the praises of the people's great achievements? No, there is not!

The "Ninth Symphony," which is hailed as the pinnacle of world symphonic music, extols the bourgeoisie's "liberty, equality, fraternity." But our symphony "Shajiabang" powerfully proclaims the proletariat's sublime ideal of "burying all imperialist reactionaries."

The violin concerto "Butterfly Lovers," which emerged under the cultivation of the anti-revolutionary revisionist literary line represented by the Chinese Khrushchev, meticulously depicts nothing more than the tragic love stories of feudal landlord class young masters and mistresses. But our symphony "Shajiabang" successfully portrays the towering images of proletarian revolutionary heroes like Guo Jian'guang, Grandma Sand, and Ah Qing!

What to express and what to sing the praises of—this is a question of serving which class's interests. As Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the present world, all culture or literature and art belong to a definite class and are geared to a definite political line."

For centuries, bourgeois symphonic music has been performed to consolidate the "throne" of the exploiting classes.

For more than a decade, symphonic music cultivated under the anti-revolutionary revisionist literary line of the Chinese Khrushchev has been nothing but a herald for their restoration of capitalism.

Our symphony "Shajiabang" has taken the stage of symphonic music with a combative posture, loudly proclaiming the cause of the proletarian revolution and becoming a combat weapon to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The revolutionary symphony "Shajiabang" has put into practice Chairman Mao's great teachings on the unity of politics and art, the unity of content and form, and the unity of revolutionary political content with the most perfect artistic form, adding a brilliant and colorful flower to the garden of proletarian revolutionary literature and art!

In the revolutionary symphony "Shajiabang," whether it is the scene of "The Battle of Shajiabang" filled with revolutionary "gunpowder," or the vivid scene of "The Army and the People Are One Family" brimming with deep class affection, these depictions of the magnificent scenes of the great people's war are all so vividly presented before us.

In the revolutionary symphony "Shajiabang," whether it is the New Fourth Army platoon leader Guo Jian'guang who loves the people and is loyal to the party, or the clever and brave underground liaison agent Ah Qing, or the revolutionary old mother Sand who is clear in her hatreds and loves, these towering images of proletarian heroes all stand so vividly before us.

"Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun!"

"The people, only the people, are the creators of world history."

Having listened to the symphony "Shajiabang" and revisiting Chairman Mao's great teachings, we feel how intimate they are!

The revolutionary symphony "Shajiabang" has achieved unprecedented successes in both politics and art in the history of symphonic music. It follows Chairman Mao's literary policy of "learning from the West to serve China" and "innovating while preserving the old," based on the needs of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, critically inheriting and revolutionarily transforming ancient and foreign artistic forms and instruments. It establishes something new for socialism and something unique for the proletariat, creating a new proletarian revolutionary literature and art with Chinese national forms and styles.

The great revolution in political content has led to a great revolution in artistic form. Our symphony "Shajiabang" dares to innovate, breaking the rigid frameworks of the foreigners and successfully combining Peking opera with symphonic music. It retains the powerful, high-pitched, and delicate characteristics of Peking opera singing, while fully utilizing the rich colors, wide range, grand scale, and expressive power of symphonic music. At the same time, it combines Western orchestral instruments with national instruments, especially Peking opera accompaniment instruments; it combines the tunes of Peking opera with the tunes of revolutionary songs; it combines recitation, chorus, duet, solo, and dialogue with the symphony orchestra. It plays the highest and most resonant "symphony" of our times, becoming a brilliant treasure of our proletarian art!

It has opened up a broad avenue for symphonic music to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers and to serve proletarian politics. It has demonstrated the bright future of symphonic music accompanying national dramas.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All new things are forged in the midst of hard struggles."

"Remembering the past, the years were full of vicissitudes."

The revolutionary symphony "Shajiabang" was forged in the midst of arduous and unyielding struggles against the anti-revolutionary revisionist literary line represented by the Chinese Khrushchev. At the time when the anti-revolutionary revisionist literary line reigned supreme and "all horses were silent," our beloved Comrade Jiang Qing, adhering to Chairman Mao's direction of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, loudly proclaimed, "Our symphonic music must take its own path." Comrade Jiang Qing personally led the proletarian revolutionary literary warriors to launch a general offensive against the anti-revolutionary revisionist literary line!

Under the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought, Comrade Jiang Qing and the revolutionary literary warriors, with the majestic spirit of "looking at the world with a cold eye," despised all the so-called artistic "frontiers" of the exploiting classes, dared to climb the peaks that others dared not climb, and finally created the first symphony in the history of world art that truly belongs to the proletariat and the laboring people!

The birth of "Shajiabang" eloquently proves that revolutionary literary warriors must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, take Comrade Jiang Qing as a shining example, and steadfastly adhere to the direction of literature and art for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, in order to create revolutionary new literature and art that serve proletarian politics!

Let us cheer for the revolutionary milestone in the history of symphonic music, for the brilliant and dazzling new literature and art of the proletariat!

Let us advance bravely along the revolutionary literary line of Chairman Mao!

　　赞革命交响音乐《沙家浜》
　　钟鼓鸣
    革命交响音乐《沙家浜》，以宏伟磅礴的气势，热情地歌颂了伟大的毛泽东思想，深刻地表现了伟大的人民战争，成功地塑造了毛泽东思想哺育下的工农兵群众的光辉形象。人类历史的创造者——工农兵群众，第一次登上了交响乐的舞台！
    这是世界交响乐发展史上划时代的大革命！
    毛主席教导我们：“你是资产阶级文艺家，你就不歌颂无产阶级而歌颂资产阶级；你是无产阶级文艺家，你就不歌颂资产阶级而歌颂无产阶级和劳动人民：二者必居其一。”
    翻开资产阶级的交响乐历史看一看，在那堆积如山的乐谱中，有哪一个音符，可曾歌颂过人类历史的创造者——人民群众？又有哪一个乐章，可曾歌颂过人民群众的丰功伟绩？没有，根本没有！
    被捧为世界交响乐“顶峰”的《第九交响乐》，它所尽情讴歌的是资产阶级的“自由、平等、博爱”；而我们的交响音乐《沙家浜》，高亢有力地奏出了要“把帝国主义反动派全埋葬”的无产阶级的崇高理想。
    在以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的反革命修正主义文艺黑线培植下出笼的《梁山伯与祝英台》小提琴协奏曲，它所精心描绘的不过是封建地主阶级小姐少爷们的涕泪交流的恋爱悲剧；而我们的交响音乐《沙家浜》，成功地塑造了郭建光、沙奶奶、阿庆嫂等无产阶级革命英雄的高大形象！
    表现什么，歌颂什么，这是为哪一个阶级利益服务的问题。正如毛主席所教导我们的：“在现在世界上，一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。”
    几百年来，资产阶级的交响乐无不是为了巩固剥削阶级的“宝座”而演奏的。
    十几年来，在中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义文艺黑线培植下的交响乐，无不是为他们复辟资本主义鸣锣开道的。
    我们的交响音乐《沙家浜》以战斗的姿态杀上了交响乐的舞台，它为无产阶级革命事业大喊大叫，成为巩固无产阶级专政的战斗武器。
    革命交响音乐《沙家浜》，实践了毛主席关于“政治和艺术的统一，内容和形式的统一，革命的政治内容和尽可能完美的艺术形式的统一”的伟大教导，为无产阶级革命文艺的百花园增添了一朵绚丽多彩的香花！
    在革命交响音乐《沙家浜》中，无论是充满了革命的“火药味”的“奇袭沙家浜”的“鏖战急”场面，还是洋溢着深厚阶级情谊的“军民鱼水一家人”的生动情景，这些表现了伟大的人民战争的壮丽画面，都是那样逼真地展现在我们面前。
    在革命交响音乐《沙家浜》中，无论是热爱人民忠于党的新四军指导员郭建光，还是机智勇敢的党的地下联络员阿庆嫂，爱憎鲜明的革命老妈妈沙奶奶，这些无产阶级英雄人物的高大形象，都是那样生动地巍然屹立在我们面前。
    “枪杆子里面出政权”！
    “人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”
    听过交响音乐《沙家浜》，重温毛主席的这些伟大的教导，使我们感到何等亲切啊！
    革命交响音乐《沙家浜》，在政治上、艺术上的成就，在交响乐历史上是前所未有的。它遵循毛主席“洋为中用”，“推陈出新”的文艺方针，根据为工农兵服务的需要，对古代的和外来的艺术形式和乐器，加以批判地继承、革命的改造，标社会主义之新，立无产阶级之异，创作出具有中国民族形式和民族风格的无产阶级革命新文艺。
    巨大的政治内容上的革命引起了巨大的艺术形式上的革命。我们的交响音乐《沙家浜》，敢字当头，标新立异，打破了洋人死人的条条框框，成功地将京剧与交响乐结合一体。它既保留了京剧唱腔的高亢有力、细腻动人等特点，又充分地发挥了交响乐色彩丰富、音域宽广、气魄宏大、富有表现力的特长。同时，它还将西洋管弦乐器与民族乐器，特别是京剧伴奏乐器结合一体；将京剧的音调与革命歌曲的音调结合一体；将朗诵、合唱、对唱、独唱、道白等多种艺术手段与交响乐队结合一体。奏出了我们时代的最高亢、最嘹亮的“交响”，成为我们无产阶级光辉灿烂的艺术珍品！
    它开辟了交响乐为工农兵服务、为无产阶级政治服务的康庄大道。它展示了交响音乐为祖国戏剧伴奏的广阔前途。
    毛主席教导我们：“一切新的东西都是从艰苦斗争中锻炼出来的。”
    “忆往昔峥嵘岁月稠。”
    革命交响音乐《沙家浜》就是在同以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的反革命修正主义文艺黑线的艰苦卓绝的斗争中冲杀出来的。在反革命修正主义文艺黑线统治的“万马齐喑”的时刻，我们敬爱的江青同志，坚持毛主席的文艺为工农兵服务的方向，响亮地提出“我国交响音乐要走自己的道路”。江青同志亲自率领着无产阶级革命文艺战士向反革命修正主义文艺黑线举行了总攻击！
    在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，江青同志和革命文艺战士以“冷眼向洋看世界”的雄伟气魄，藐视一切剥削阶级的所谓艺术“尖端”，敢于攀登前人所不敢攀登的高峰，终于创作出了世界艺术史上第一部真正属于无产阶级和劳动人民的交响音乐！
    《沙家浜》的诞生雄辩地证明，革命的文艺战士必须高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，以江青同志为光辉榜样，坚定不移地坚持工农兵文艺方向，才能够创造出为无产阶级政治服务的革命新文艺！
    让我们为交响乐划时代的大革命，为无产阶级光辉灿烂的革命新文艺而欢呼！
    让我们沿着毛主席的革命文艺路线奋勇前进！
