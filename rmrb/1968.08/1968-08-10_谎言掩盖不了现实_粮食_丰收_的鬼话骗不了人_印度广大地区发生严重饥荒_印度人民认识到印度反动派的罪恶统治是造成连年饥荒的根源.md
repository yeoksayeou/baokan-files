Lies cannot conceal reality. The "bumper harvest" of grain cannot deceive people. Serious famines have occurred in vast regions of India. The Indian people have recognized that the evil rule of the Indian reactionaries is the root cause of the annual famines.

According to Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi: Under the brutal exploitation and oppression of the Indian landlords and big bourgeoisie, India's agricultural productivity has been severely damaged. In the states of Assam, Orissa, Rajasthan, and Bihar, serious famines have occurred. Millions of impoverished Indian farmers are struggling on the brink of starvation, and the number of people dying of hunger is increasing day by day.

Indian newspapers have revealed that in Orissa, a major rice-producing state, out of the thirteen districts, nine have experienced serious famines. More and more people are surviving by eating grass roots and wild fruits. In many households, "not even a single grain of rice can be found." "People have already sold their utensils, cows, oxen, goats, and other belongings." "Deaths due to famine are increasing day by day."

Reports from Assam's Goalpara district also indicate that people are dying of hunger. In this region, the government-regulated price of rice is 23 rupees per maund, but rice is not available at this price. The little rice available in the free market is sold at 80 to 90 rupees per maund.

In Bihar and Rajasthan, people have neither grain to eat nor water to drink, and many are dying of hunger and thirst.

The Indian reactionary government, instead of addressing this serious famine, shamelessly fabricates lies, claiming that there is a "bumper harvest" and that no one is starving, in an attempt to escape responsibility.

However, lies cannot conceal the truth. While the Indian reactionary government is boasting about a "bumper harvest," it is begging for grain from its American masters. Reports indicate that in the second half of this year, the Indian reactionary government has begged for 300 million tons of grain from the U.S. government.

At the same time, the Indian reactionary government, under the pretext of a "bumper harvest," is intensifying the seizure of grain from the people. Previously, the Indian government could at most "purchase" about 400 million tons of grain from the people annually. This year, it has set a target to "purchase" 800 million tons of grain from the people. To achieve this "purchase" plan, it has mobilized the entire reactionary ruling apparatus, from the central to the local levels, including the police and the so-called "civil defense system" of reactionary landlord armed forces, to intensify the violent seizure of grain.

The Indian people are awakening. They are increasingly realizing that the Indian landlords and big bourgeoisie, in collusion with U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, are ruthlessly plundering the vast majority of Indian farmers, which is the root cause of the annual famines. The broad masses of farmers are rising up to resist the evil rule of the Indian reactionaries, to resist the reactionary government's seizure of the people's livelihood, and to engage in land struggles. All of this has dealt a heavy blow to the Indian reactionary ruling class.

　　谎言掩盖不了现实　粮食“丰收”的鬼话骗不了人
　　印度广大地区发生严重饥荒
　　印度人民认识到印度反动派的罪恶统治是造成连年饥荒的根源
    据新华社讯　新德里消息：在印度大地主、大资产阶级残酷剥削压榨下，印度的农业生产力遭到严重破坏，在阿萨姆、奥里萨、拉贾斯坦和比哈尔等邦的广大地区，发生了严重饥荒。千百万印度贫苦农民挣扎在饥饿线上，饿死的人与日俱增。
    印度报纸透露，在盛产大米的奥里萨邦，全邦十三个县中有九个县发生了严重饥荒，越来越多的人在靠吃草根和野果度日。许多人家里“甚至找不到一粒米”，“人们早就出卖了他们的用具、母牛、公牛、山羊和其他东西”，“由于饥荒而引起的死亡正在日益增加。”
    报纸透露，饿死人的消息还不断从阿萨姆邦的戈阿尔帕拉县传来。在这个地区，按照政府规定的大米价格每芒特二十三卢比，但根本买不到米，而在自由市场上出售的少得可怜的大米，每芒特竟高达八十至九十卢比。
    在比哈尔和拉贾斯坦等邦，人民既没有粮吃也没有水喝，许多人由于饥饿和干渴而死。
    印度反动政府对于这种严重的饥荒，不仅熟视无睹，而且无耻地编造谎言，胡说什么粮食“丰收”，没有人饿死等等，妄图以此来逃脱罪责。
    但是，谎言掩盖不了现实。就在印度反动政府大肆吹嘘粮食“丰收”的时候，它的手却伸向美国主子乞讨粮食。据报道，在今年下半年印度反动政府已向美国政府乞讨到三百万吨粮食。
    与此同时，印度反动政府还借口“丰收”加紧向人民搜刮粮食。过去，印度政府每年最多能向人民“收购”到四百万吨左右粮食，而今年它订了一个向人民“收购”八百万吨粮食的“宏图大略”。为了实现这个“收购”计划，它动员了从中央到地方的整个反动统治机构、警察和所谓“民防系统”的反动地主武装，加紧用暴力进行搜刮。
    印度人民正在觉醒，他们越来越清楚地认识到，印度大地主、大资产阶级勾结美帝苏修残酷掠夺印度广大农民，是造成连年饥荒的根源。广大农民纷纷起来反抗印度反动派的罪恶统治，抵抗反动政府搜刮民脂民膏，夺地斗争此伏彼起。所有这些，给予印度反动统治阶级以沉重的打击。
