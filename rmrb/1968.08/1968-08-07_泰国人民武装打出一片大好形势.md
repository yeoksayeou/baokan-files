The red flag flies high on Phupan Mountain, and the people's warriors display their heroism. In the midst of the world's revolutionary struggles achieving a great situation, continuous reports of victories in the armed struggle of the Thai people are coming in. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, the people's armed forces, after three years of arduous struggle, have smashed the "encirclement and suppression" campaigns launched by the U.S.-Thanom reactionary clique time and time again, achieving a great situation. The Chinese people, who are on the verge of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, enthusiastically acclaim the great victories in the armed struggle of the Thai people and extend their warmest congratulations to the heroic Thai people!

To expel American imperialism and overthrow the reactionary rule of the Thanom-Baibo traitorous clique, the Thai people have waged a long and heroic struggle. Especially since August 1965, the Communist Party of Thailand has led the broad masses of the people in launching a revolutionary armed struggle, completely changing the face of the Thai people's revolution. In the past three years, the spark of the people's revolutionary armed struggle ignited in northeastern Thailand has spread to 30 out of the 71 provinces across the country. The armed struggle of the Thai people has dealt a heavy blow to the reactionary rule of the U.S.-Thanom clique.

The Thai people's armed forces, under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, are a revolutionary army that comes from the people, relies on the people, and serves the people. The soldiers in this force have a high level of political awareness, are the bravest, most intelligent, and most resourceful in battle. In the fierce battles, the Thai people's armed forces have formed a close, fish-in-water relationship with the broad masses of the people. The military and the people unite as one, using the guerrilla warfare tactics of "retreat when the enemy advances, harass when the enemy stays, attack when the enemy is tired, and pursue when the enemy retreats," striking the enemy everywhere and fully demonstrating the mighty power of the people's war.

From the very beginning, the U.S.-Thanom reactionary clique has attempted to extinguish the flames of the Thai people's revolutionary armed struggle. As the people's armed forces rapidly develop, the scale of the U.S.-Thanom reactionary clique's "encirclement and suppression" campaigns has grown larger and larger. This year, the enemy has mobilized a large number of armed military and police forces, crazily suppressing the people's armed forces in various places, using airplanes, tanks, artillery, napalm, and other modern killing tools, and even deploying the air force to carry out inhuman "carpet bombing." However, the Thai people's armed forces have displayed a great, fearless revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win, using flexible strategic and tactical maneuvers. In the first half of this year, they have engaged in over 400 battles with the reactionary military and police, not only smashing the enemy's "encirclement and suppression" campaigns with entire battalions but also annihilating the enemy's patrol squads in groups. Moreover, they have repeatedly taken the initiative to attack the enemy's isolated strongholds, achieving one victory after another. Recently, the Thai people's armed forces bravely attacked the U.S. airbase in Udon, causing the U.S.-Thai reactionaries to tremble with fear.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. It looks as if the reactionaries are formidable, but in reality, they have no real power. From a long-term perspective, the truly powerful force does not belong to the reactionaries but to the people." The victorious development of the Thai people's armed struggle is a new proof of this great truth. People see that even in a country like Thailand, which is under such strict control by American imperialism and has a land area of only 510,000 square kilometers, as long as Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought are closely combined with the country's revolutionary reality, and the people are firmly relied upon to wage a people's war and take the path of surrounding the cities from the countryside, the revolutionary forces will definitely be able to develop and ultimately change the balance of power between the enemy and ourselves, achieving the final victory of the revolution.

The victorious development of the Thai people's armed struggle is not only a heavy blow to the Thai reactionaries but also a heavy blow to the aggressive policies and war policies of American imperialism. For many years, American imperialism has always used Thailand as an important stronghold for invading Indochina, suppressing the revolution in Southeast Asia, and opposing socialist China. The Thai reactionary ruling clique has always been a loyal lackey of American imperialism's aggressive war, not only directly providing cannon fodder to participate in the criminal war of massacring the Vietnamese people but also allowing American imperialism to establish a large number of military bases on Thai territory. About 80% of the bandit planes that bombed North Vietnam took off from U.S. military bases in Thailand. The development of the Thai people's armed struggle has made the American imperialists, who have suffered heavy losses in the Vietnam War, face a "second Vietnam."

To suppress the Thai people's revolution and expand their aggression in Indochina, American imperialism is using every means to support the Thai reactionary ruling clique with bayonets and dollars. However, no matter how the U.S.-Thai reactionaries struggle, they will definitely not be able to save themselves from their shameful failure.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The just struggles of the peoples of all countries in the world are mutually supportive." The Thai people's revolutionary struggle is an important component of the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Southeast Asia and the world. The development of the Thai people's armed struggle is a powerful support for the Vietnamese people who are fighting to the death and a major support for the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Southeast Asia and the world. The Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought and tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, firmly stand on the side of the Thai people and support the Thai people's just struggle. The Thai people's armed struggle is long-term and arduous, and there are still many difficulties ahead. However, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, the Thai people will definitely be able to overcome all obstacles and ultimately, victory will belong to the Thai people.

　　泰国人民武装打出一片大好形势
　　中国人民解放军总后勤部　红勤兵
    普潘山上红旗飘，人民战士逞英豪。在全世界人民革命斗争一片大好的形势下，不断传来泰国人民武装斗争胜利的捷报。泰国共产党领导的人民武装，经过三年来艰苦的斗争，粉碎了美国—他侬反动集团一次又一次的“围剿”，打出了一个大好的局面。正在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的中国人民，热烈欢呼泰国人民武装斗争的伟大胜利，向英雄的泰国人民表示最热烈的祝贺！
    为了驱逐美帝国主义，推翻他侬—巴博卖国集团的反动统治，泰国人民进行了长期的英勇斗争。特别是一九六五年八月以来，泰国共产党领导广大人民展开了革命的武装斗争，使泰国人民革命的面貌为之一新。三年来，在泰国东北部点燃的人民革命武装斗争的星星之火，已经蔓延到全国七十一个府中的三十个府。泰国人民武装的英勇斗争沉重地打击了美国—他侬反动集团的反动统治。
    泰国共产党领导下的泰国人民武装，是一支来自人民，依靠人民，为人民服务的革命军队。参加这支队伍的战士具有高度的政治觉悟，打起仗来最勇敢，最聪明，最机智。在激烈的战斗中，泰国人民武装同广大人民群众结成了鱼水般的亲密关系。军民团结一致，运用“敌进我退，敌驻我扰，敌疲我打，敌退我追”的游击战战术，到处打击敌人，充分发挥了人民战争的强大威力。
    美国—他侬反动集团从一开始就妄想扑灭泰国人民革命武装斗争的烈火。随着人民武装的迅速发展，美国—他侬反动集团“围剿”的规模也一次比一次扩大。今年以来，敌人出动大批武装军警，疯狂镇压各地人民武装，使用了飞机、坦克、大炮、凝固汽油弹等现代化的杀人工具，甚至出动空军，实行灭绝人性的所谓“地毯式”轰炸。但是，泰国人民武装发扬了敢于斗争、敢于胜利的大无畏革命精神，运用机动灵活的战略战术，今年上半年就同反动军警作战四百余次，不但粉碎了敌人整营兵力的“围剿”，成股地歼灭敌人的巡逻队，而且多次主动袭击敌人的孤立据点，取得了一个又一个的胜利。最近，泰国人民武装英勇袭击了乌隆美国空军基地，更使美泰反动派惊恐万状。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席指出：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。”泰国人民武装斗争的胜利发展，是这个伟大真理的一个新的证明。人们看到：即使象泰国这样一个受美帝国主义的控制如此严密的、土地面积只有五十一万平方公里的国家，只要把马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想同本国的革命实际紧密地结合起来，坚决依靠人民群众，展开人民战争，走农村包围城市的道路，革命力量就一定能够得到发展，并最后改变敌我力量对比，取得革命的最后胜利。
    泰国人民武装斗争的胜利发展，不仅是对泰国反动派的沉重打击，而且是对美帝国主义侵略政策和战争政策的沉重打击。多年来，美帝国主义一直把泰国作为侵略印度支那、镇压东南亚革命、反对社会主义中国的重要据点。而泰国反动统治集团也一贯死心塌地地充当美帝国主义侵略战争的马前卒，它不仅直接提供炮灰参与屠杀越南人民的罪恶战争，而且让美帝国主义在泰国领土上建立大量军事基地。美帝国主义轰炸越南北方的强盗飞机，有百分之八十左右是从美国在泰国的军事基地起飞的。泰国人民武装斗争的发展，使得在侵越战争中碰得头破血流的美帝国主义，面临着“第二个越南”。
    为了镇压泰国人民革命，并且扩大在印度支那的侵略战争，美帝国主义正在千方百计地用刺刀和美元支撑泰国的反动统治集团。但是，不管美泰反动派怎样进行挣扎，都绝对挽救不了它们的可耻失败。
    毛主席教导我们：“全世界各国人民的正义斗争，都是互相支持的。”泰国人民革命斗争是东南亚人民和全世界人民革命斗争的一个重要组成部分。泰国人民武装斗争的发展，对于正在浴血奋战的越南人民是一个有力的支援，对东南亚、对全世界人民革命斗争也是一个重大支持。用毛泽东思想武装起来的，经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的中国人民，坚决站在泰国人民一边，支持泰国人民的正义斗争。泰国人民武装斗争是长期的、艰苦的，面前的困难还很多，但是，在泰国共产党的正确领导下，泰国人民必定能够扫除一切障碍，最后胜利一定属于泰国人民。
