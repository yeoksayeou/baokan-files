Under the brilliant guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought and the latest instructions of Chairman Mao, the revolutionary and production situation in Fujian Province is excellent. Mao Zedong Thought is more widely spread than ever before, the revolutionary criticism is deepening step by step, and the revolutionary unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination are developing rapidly. Industrial and agricultural production is thriving.

	NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY, FUZHOU, August 17th — Under the brilliant guidance of great Mao Zedong Thought, and under the latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao, the revolutionary criticism in various parts of Fujian is deepening step by step. The revolutionary unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination from the bottom up are surging higher and higher. Industrial and agricultural production is thriving, and the revolutionary and production situation in the entire province is excellent and getting better and better.

	The ship sails with the helmsman, and the revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. Fujian Province, located on the front line of national defense, has, in the more than two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, with boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, boundless loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, eagerly studied and applied Chairman Mao's works. They have armed themselves with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. After the great leader Chairman Mao issued the latest instruction that "holding study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes," the revolutionary masses in various places responded enthusiastically. With the enthusiastic help and support of the local garrison and support-left troops of the People's Liberation Army, they held Mao Zedong Thought study classes extensively. Various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes have sprung up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. According to incomplete statistics, from last October to this June, the province has held more than 60,000 study classes of various types, with more than 4 million participants, making Mao Zedong Thought widely spread throughout the province.

	The great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "Within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interests. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." Following Chairman Mao's instruction, revolutionary mass organizations in various parts of Fujian, with the help of the garrison and support-left personnel, jointly held Mao Zedong Thought study classes. In these classes, they consciously used Mao Zedong Thought to fight against the "self" in their minds, to fight against bourgeois factionalism, to strengthen proletarian party spirit, and to criticize revisionism. They smashed the sabotage and split activities of a handful of class enemies. At the same time, they resolutely opposed right opportunism, right splitism, right capitulationism, and the bourgeois reactionary trend of "left" in form but right in essence. They smashed the right opportunist wind of reversal, removed obstacles on the road ahead, and rapidly developed a revolutionary tide of revolutionary unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination from the bottom up. Up to now, out of the seven prefectures, two municipalities directly under the province, and 66 counties (cities) in the province, four prefectures and 27 counties (cities) have established revolutionary committees, and many counties are preparing to establish revolutionary committees. More than half of the industrial and mining enterprises in the province have achieved revolutionary unity or revolutionary three-in-one combination.

	The great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the condition of socialism. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and its led revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries. It is a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Chairman Mao's great teaching has further armed the Fujian proletarian revolutionaries and the broad masses of the frontline soldiers and people. Through studying Chairman Mao's important instruction, they have further raised their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and strengthened their enemy awareness. They clearly realize that Fujian is on the frontline of national defense. The closer the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to complete victory, the more viciously a handful of spies, traitors, unrepentant capitalist-roaders, and all reactionaries will struggle to the death. Based on the heightened awareness, the broad revolutionary masses have raised the banner of revolutionary criticism of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, carried forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, and launched a fierce attack on the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Fujian, a handful of spies, traitors, Kuomintang reactionary remnants, and landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who have not been reformed. They systematically exposed and settled accounts with the heinous crimes of Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in opposing the Party, opposing socialism, and opposing Mao Zedong Thought. They severely criticized their entire set of counter-revolutionary revisionist lines aimed at restoring capitalism in industry, agriculture, culture, education, and other fronts. The mass revolutionary criticism has greatly suppressed the arrogance of the class enemies and greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary people. Through the mass revolutionary criticism, the further spread of Mao Zedong Thought has been promoted, and the class struggle and the struggle between the two lines awareness of the broad revolutionary masses have been greatly enhanced.

	The "Sixteen Points" personally drafted by Chairman Mao point out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a powerful driving force for the development of social productive forces in our country." With the development of the revolutionary situation, the production situation in Fujian Province's industrial, agricultural, and transportation sectors is getting better month by month. Revolutionary workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and revolutionary cadres are resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" and striving for double victories in revolution and production. Currently, from the banks of the Min River to the banks of the Jiulong River, the early rice has been basically harvested, and the famous high-yield rice area of Longxi Prefecture continues to bring in good harvest news. The forest-rich northern Fujian mountains, revolutionary forestry workers are producing a large amount of building materials to support industrial and agricultural production and construction in various places. The Min-Fu Railway and Nan-Fu Railway that run through the entire province are busy with transportation, and everywhere is a thriving scene.

    在伟大毛泽东思想光辉照耀下　在毛主席最新指示指引下
    福建省革命和生产形势一片大好
    毛泽东思想空前大普及，革命大批判步步深入，革命大联合和革命三结合的洪流迅猛发展，工农业生产欣欣向荣
    新华社福州十七日电　在伟大的毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉照耀下，在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示指引下，福建各地革命大批判步步深入，自下而上的革命大联合和革命三结合的洪流一浪高过一浪，工农业生产欣欣向荣，全省的革命和生产形势一派大好，越来越好。
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。地处国防前线的福建省，广大无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，在两年多的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，怀着无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的深厚无产阶级感情，如饥似渴地活学活用毛主席著作，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑。伟大领袖毛主席发出“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的最新指示后，各地革命群众闻风而动，他们在人民解放军当地驻军和支左部队广大指战员的热情帮助和支持下，大办毛泽东思想学习班，各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，如雨后春笋，蓬勃发展。据不完全统计，从去年十月到今年六月份，全省已举办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班六万多期，参加学习的共有四百多万人次，使毛泽东思想在全省范围内空前大普及。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”遵照毛主席这一指示，福建各地革命群众组织，在驻军和支左人员的帮助下，联合举办了毛泽东思想学习班。他们在学习班里自觉地用毛泽东思想狠斗自己头脑里的“私”字，狠斗资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，狠批修正主义，粉碎了一小撮阶级敌人的挑拨离间和分裂活动。同时，他们坚决反对右倾机会主义，右倾分裂主义，右倾投降主义和形“左”实右的资产阶级反动思潮，粉碎右倾翻案妖风，扫除了前进道路上的障碍。一个自下而上地实现革命大联合和革命三结合的革命洪流，迅猛向前发展。到最近为止，全省七个专区、两个省辖市、六十六个县（市）中，已有四个专区和二十七个县（市）成立了革命委员会，还有不少县正在筹备成立革命委员会。全省各地已有一半以上的工矿企业单位实现了革命大联合或革命三结合。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”毛主席这一伟大教导，进一步武装了福建无产阶级革命派和前线广大军民。他们通过学习毛主席这一重要指示，进一步提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，加强了敌情观念。他们清醒地认识到，福建地处祖国国防最前线，无产阶级文化大革命越接近全面胜利，一小撮特务、叛徒、死不悔改的走资派以及一切反革命分子，必将更加阴险毒辣地进行垂死挣扎。在提高认识的基础上，广大革命群众更高地举起毛泽东思想的革命批判旗帜，发扬无产阶级的彻底革命精神，向中国赫鲁晓夫及其在福建的代理人和一小撮特务、叛徒、国民党反动派残渣余孽以及没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，发动了猛烈的进攻，系统地揭发和清算了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的滔天罪行，狠批了他们在工业、农业、文化教育等各条战线所推行的一整套妄图复辟资本主义的反革命修正主义路线。群众性的革命大批判，大灭了阶级敌人的威风，大长了革命人民的志气。通过群众性的革命大批判，促进了毛泽东思想的进一步大普及，大大提高了广大革命群众的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。
    毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”指出：“无产阶级文化大革命是使我国社会生产力发展的一个强大的推动力。”随着革命形势的发展，福建省的工业、农业、交通运输等生产战线上的形势也一月比一月好。广大革命工人、贫下中农和革命干部，坚决贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，努力夺取革命和生产的双胜利。目前，从闽江两岸到九龙江畔，早稻已经基本收完，著名的水稻高产区龙溪专区不断传来丰收的喜讯。森林资源丰富的闽北山区，革命的林业职工正在生产大量建设用材支援各地工农业生产建设。横贯全省的鹰厦铁路、南福铁路运输繁忙，到处是一派欣欣向荣的景象。
