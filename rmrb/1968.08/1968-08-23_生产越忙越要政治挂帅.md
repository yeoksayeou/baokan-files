Every June and July, the production peak season for the Suzhou Flour Mill, this year, due to the bumper wheat harvest in the Suzhou area, the mill's production tasks are heavier than any previous year. With the current two-shift production speed in the factory, it is impossible to complete the monthly production quota.

What to do? At the factory's revolutionary committee meeting, someone suggested increasing production from two shifts per day to three. However, this approach presents several practical difficulties: a shortage of technical backbone personnel, more novices than experienced workers, and absenteeism due to illness, among other issues. After careful consideration, it was determined that three-shift production was not feasible.

The market grain bureau revolutionary committee director and military representative, Comrade Xu Hengjing, who was stationed at the factory, thought: While technical backbone personnel are scarce and there is absenteeism due to illness, these are practical difficulties. However, we should not only focus on the technical aspects but also consider the political factors and the human element. He shared his thoughts with the leaders of the factory's revolutionary committee. Everyone agreed that his idea was excellent. They unanimously recognized that the previous calculations had fallen into the trap of Liu Shaoqi's "technology first" and "business in command." Chairman Mao taught us: "Politics is the commander, the soul. Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." The heavier the tasks, the more we must be loyal to Chairman Mao and steadfastly follow the path of emphasizing proletarian politics. Therefore, the factory's revolutionary committee convened a full-factory staff meeting, further arming the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, quickly raising the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the revolutionary staff throughout the factory, and establishing the confidence and courage to overcome difficulties.

The masses were mobilized, and the originally anticipated practical difficulties were easily resolved. With insufficient technical strength, colleagues from auxiliary departments actively supported the main production workshops, with experienced workers guiding novices, learning from each other, helping each other, and promoting each other. Previously, during the two-shift production, the electrical group had to ask a master from a sister factory to help out, but now they said: We will tackle our own difficulties, allowing colleagues from sister factories to return to their units to promote revolution and production, and we guarantee to complete the task! When the sieve frames in the flat sieve workshop broke, it used to take more than a day just to repair them, stopping production. Now, they continue production while repairing the broken sieve frames in their spare time and replace them on Sundays, ensuring normal production.

Currently, the political atmosphere in this factory is very strong, and the revolutionary and production high tides are surging higher and higher. The flour production task has been completed with an excess of one million pounds. Revolutionary workers say: "The revolutionary committee is truly good, the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought is held high; emphasizing politics has great power, and we will always follow Chairman Mao's revolutionary line."

    生产越忙越要政治挂帅
    每年六、七月间，是苏州面粉厂的生产旺季。由于今年苏州地区小麦大丰收，面粉厂的生产任务比以往任何一年都重。按照现在厂里每天两班的生产速度，不能完成月产量任务。
    怎么办？在厂革委会会议上，有人提出把每天两班生产增加到三班生产。但这样作，具体困难不少：技术骨干缺乏，生手多熟手少，又有病员缺勤，等等，算来算去，每日三班生产搞不了。
    正在厂里蹲点的市粮食局革委会主任、军队代表徐恒敬同志心想：技术骨干少，病员缺勤，等等，固然是一些具体困难，但我们不能尽算技术账，而不算政治账，不把人的因素摆进去。他把自己的想法跟厂革委会领导成员说了。大家觉得他的意见很好。一致认识到：过去的算法，是上了中国赫鲁晓夫“技术第一”“业务挂帅”的当。毛主席教导说：政治是统帅，是灵魂，“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”任务越重，我们越要无限忠于毛主席，坚定不移地走突出无产阶级政治的道路。于是，厂革委会召开全厂职工大会，用毛泽东思想进一步武装群众，迅速提高了全厂革命职工的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，树立了克服困难的信心和勇气。
    群众发动起来了，原来设想的那些具体困难都迎刃而解。技术力量不够，辅助部门的同志就主动支援主要车间生产，熟手带生手，互相学习，互相帮助，互相促进。以前电工组每天两班生产时，还从兄弟厂请来一个老师傅帮忙，现在他们说：我们的困难自己顶上，让兄弟厂的同志回原单位抓革命促生产，我们保证完成任务！平筛车间的筛格子破了，过去光修理就得停机一天多，现在他们一边坚持生产，一边利用业余时间备好新的筛格子，并利用星期天及时地把破筛格子换下来，保证了正常生产。
    目前，这个厂政治空气很浓，革命、生产的高潮一浪高过一浪。面粉的生产任务超额完成一百万斤。革命职工说：“革委会真正好，毛泽东思想红旗举得高；突出政治威力大，永远沿着毛主席的革命路线跑。”　殷怀章
