A young man emerged from under a Dongfanghong-brand tractor, his face covered in sweat, his hands greasy. A comrade walking by laughed and said, "Why are you still tinkering with the oil?" He replied, "I will tinker with it all my life. The essence of the working class can never change!"

This young man is Comrade Ma Zhenhua, the first deputy chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Dongming County, Shandong Province, and a worker representative.

	Standing Forever at the Forefront of Class Struggle

On February 7 of this year, the Revolutionary Committee of Dongming County, Shandong Province, was born amidst the storm of class struggle!

On this day, Ma Zhenhua's heart was filled with excitement, and he could not sleep for a long time. He opened Volume 4 of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and repeatedly read: "To achieve national victory is only the first step in a long march of ten thousand li. ... China's revolution is great, but the road after the revolution is longer, the work is greater, and more arduous. This must be made clear to the Party now, and comrades must continue to maintain a humble, prudent, unarrogant, and unhurried attitude, and must continue to maintain a hardworking spirit." Chairman Mao's teachings, word by word, are like bright lamps shining in front of his eyes, sentence by sentence, like alarm bells ringing in his ears. He gazed at Chairman Mao's portrait and silently made a vow: "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! I will forever be loyal to you, resolutely follow your words, maintain the essence of the working class, and in the face of achievements and victories, I will not be arrogant or complacent, stopping in my tracks. I will climb the 'public' peak of the proletariat like climbing a mountain, leaving my footprints behind!"

Soon, the county Revolutionary Committee received several letters from poor and lower-middle peasants requesting help to uncover the class struggle cover in Jinzhuang Brigade of Mazu Commune. Ma Zhenhua, upon hearing this, was filled with enthusiasm and was about to step forward, but then he thought, as the deputy chairman of the county Revolutionary Committee, this brigade's problem is a "hard nut to crack." If he started by poking such a big "hornet's nest," and if he couldn't handle it well with a few pokes, what would happen to his future work?

At this moment, the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao resonated in his ears: "We work and struggle to solve difficulties. The more difficult the place, the more we should go, this is what a good comrade should do." Ma Zhenhua suddenly felt his face burning. Why didn't he dare to step forward? The main reason was that the "self" in his mind was playing tricks, wanting to protect his "honor." Therefore, he lacked the spirit of going where there are difficulties. If this "self" is allowed to develop, in no time, the essence of the working class will fade. To maintain the essence of the working class, one must carry forward the fearless revolutionary spirit, forever stand at the forefront of class struggle, dare to forge ahead, dare to do, and dare to make a revolution! He decided to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, go to the places with difficulties, and go to the sharpest points of class struggle.

After obtaining the agreement of the county Revolutionary Committee's standing committee, Comrade Ma Zhenhua led six comrades to Jinzhuang Brigade. They ate and lived in the homes of poor and lower-middle peasant community members. During the day, they labored while propagating Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions to the community members; at night, they organized poor and lower-middle peasants to hold study sessions using Chairman Mao's works, conducted reminiscences of bitterness and sweetness, and fought against selfishness and criticized revisionism. They helped this brigade achieve revolutionary great unity on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought. At this time, a handful of class enemies, in order to save their dying fate, tried to win over Comrade Ma Zhenhua with food and drink. Ma Zhenhua immediately exposed the class enemies' tricks, saying sternly, "In the past, you used sugar-coated bullets to hit some cadres, but today, we, the revolutionary masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will not fall into your trap. Do you want to pull us down? Forget it!"

The class enemies slunk away. The poor and lower-middle peasants smiled and said, "Old Ma is one of us, the poor and lower-middle peasants!"

After more than a month of fierce struggle, the class struggle cover in Jinzhuang Brigade was finally lifted, the "hornet's nest" was poked, and a handful of class enemies were exposed! The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants held their heads high, and revolution and production were in full swing.

	Following Chairman Mao's Great Strategic Deployment

Comrades from the County Revolutionary Workers' Rebel Command Department said, "Old Ma has only one heart, tightly following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment." This statement is based on facts. He often told his comrades, "We workers have broad shoulders and heavy burdens. We must never disappoint Chairman Mao, and we must never deviate from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line."

During a previous period, a "leftist" trend confused a part of the revolutionary ranks. They rushed around, inciting a part of the masses to split from the revolutionary ranks and establish their own factions. They also spread the rumor that the "County Revolutionary Workers' Rebel Command Department has turned right and is no longer revolutionary." The County Revolutionary Workers' Rebel Command Department also held several meetings to organize forces to prepare for a counterattack. At this critical moment, when both sides were like primed explosives, the revolutionary ranks faced the danger of splitting.

At this crucial moment, Comrade Ma Zhenhua stood on the proletarian party principle, first persuaded the workers' organization to withdraw the counterattack plan. Then, he followed Chairman Mao's instruction to "guide the petty-bourgeois ideology in our ranks onto the track of proletarian revolution," leading the standing committee of the County Revolutionary Workers' Rebel Command Department to deeply penetrate into factories and schools to propagate and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Through meticulous ideological and political work, the part of the masses that had split quickly realized their mistakes and returned to the ranks, avoiding the split of the revolutionary ranks, further consolidating the revolutionary great unity, and developing a good situation. Now, when people mention this incident, many have deep feelings and say, "If it weren't for Old Ma and the workers' broad-mindedness and consideration for the overall situation, both sides would have clashed." "Old Ma is indeed a representative of the workers' elder brother."

During the cleanup of class ranks, Ma Zhenhua discovered that a rightist reversal group was active. These guys were very secretive, like ducks swimming, appearing calm on the surface, but their black claws were scratching everywhere underneath. Therefore, some comrades were not very alert. When Ma Zhenhua raised this issue at the expanded meeting of the county Revolutionary Committee's standing committee, some comrades disagreed, causing a split. What to do? Comrade Ma Zhenhua personally went deep into the masses to investigate and study, mobilizing the masses to quickly expose the cover of this rightist counter-revolutionary reversal group, firing the first shot in the cleanup of class ranks, and giving those comrades who had once been right-leaning a great education.

	Forever United with the Masses

Chairman Mao said, "We must insist on the system of cadres participating in collective production labor. Our Party and state cadres are ordinary laborers, not lords sitting on the heads of the people." Comrade Ma Zhenhua wrote this great teaching in his notebook, engraved it in his heart, and implemented it in his actions.

Ma Zhenhua was originally a tractor repair worker. Last autumn, when the tractor team's comrades went to the countryside to collect tractor fees, they saw that a diesel engine in Yaozhuang Brigade was broken, and the community members were frantically worried. They returned to the office and told Old Ma, and the next day, Old Ma walked in the dark for more than thirty miles and arrived at Yaozhuang Brigade at dawn. He disassembled and reassembled, reassembled and disassembled, tinkering for half a day, finally fixing the diesel engine. Ma Zhenhua hadn't eaten a meal or drunk a bowl of water, wiped the grease off his hands, and was about to leave. The community members felt guilty and asked him, "Comrade, what is your name?" Ma Zhenhua wiped the sweat off his face and smiled, saying, "Called—Chairman Mao's worker."

After Ma Zhenhua became the deputy chairman of the county Revolutionary Committee, he still insisted on participating in collective production labor. He often said, "Leaders must be practical, and labor is important." So, whenever he had free time, he would return to his original unit to wield the hammer, tinker with the oil, and repair tractors. Some workers joked, "Old Ma, this grease is black and sticky, touch it once, and your hands will be dirty!"

"Dirty hands are not scary, what's scary is a dirty brain," Ma Zhenhua seriously replied, "Dirty hands can be washed, but a dirty brain will go moldy and change quality!" An old worker present heard this and happily patted Ma Zhenhua's shoulder, saying, "Good! With such a representative, we are at ease."

Ma Zhenhua was able to frequently participate in collective production labor, which was the result of his conscious effort to break selfishness and establish public-mindedness.

At the beginning of this year's wheat harvest, Ma Zhenhua went to a production team and harvested wheat with the community members. For the first two days, his spirits were high, but after two days of harvesting, his waist and legs ached, and his whole body felt uncomfortable. He thought, "I'll stop today, it doesn't matter if I'm not there, the community members won't mind." However, "cadres participating in collective production labor is a fundamental matter in the socialist system, it helps to overcome bureaucracy, prevent revisionism and dogmatism." Chairman Mao's great teaching made Ma Zhenhua immediately realize: whether to persist or not, this is not just a matter of realizing his own resolve, but a major issue of whether to eliminate bureaucratic tendencies and whether to share weal and woe with the masses, preventing revisionism and change. In the past, when he drove a tractor, he worked from early morning to late night, not knowing what fatigue was. Now, after harvesting wheat for two days, he couldn't hold on. This shows that he had unknowingly "changed," becoming afraid of labor. Loving labor, his thoughts and feelings would be close to the laboring people; fearing labor, his thoughts and feelings would be stuck with the exploiting class. Thinking of this, Ma Zhenhua immediately went to the fields and harvested wheat with the community members again.

From then on, Ma Zhenhua regarded participating in collective production labor as one of his systems. Day after day, the masses regarded him as an ordinary member, liked to talk to him, and liked to raise issues with him. Participating in collective production labor became a good way for him to stay close to the masses. From then on, he worked harder, actively taking on heavy and dirty work. He encouraged himself, saying, "'Self' must be broken thoroughly, 'bureaucratic tendencies' must not be attached, only by laboring frequently can one be united with the masses!"

	Consciously Accepting the Supervision of the Masses

Comrade Ma Zhenhua often told his comrades-in-arms, "We are in power, and we must not indulge in privileges. Privileges are the slippery slope to revisionism."

On the day the Revolutionary Committee was established, comrades kindly arranged a single-person office for Comrade Ma Zhenhua. Inside, there was a large brown bed, a round rattan chair, a desk, a file cabinet, a telephone machine, etc. Ma Zhenhua took one look at the luxurious setup and, without a word, picked up his bedding and left. The comrades said, "This is your office!" "I don't want such an office!" Ma Zhenhua humorously said, "Living here will make me sick." After saying this, he moved back to the "old base"—the County Revolutionary Workers' Command Department. To this day, Comrade Ma Zhenhua has no separate office, no fixed single-person dormitory, only a faded yellow shoulder bag, which he carries every day to study, labor, attend meetings, and work. The masses say, "Old Ma's yellow shoulder bag is both a file cabinet and a desk, carrying it wherever he goes. Old Ma is just like the Eight Route Army of old!"

Ma Zhenhua's wife, to take care of him, wanted to move to the county Revolutionary Committee's headquarters to live. Ma Zhenhua said, "The most important thing between husband and wife is mutual help, mutual promotion, and jointly implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. If you move to the county to live, it will be more convenient in life, but that way you will be detached from the masses, detached from your class brothers."

These things, comrades saw them with their own eyes and thought about them in their hearts. Some said, "Day after day, if this goes on, Old Ma's body won't hold up." Others said, "Old Ma is too serious, small things are not worth worrying about!"

Ma Zhenhua, however, did not think so. He said, "At the 'life gate,' one must also hold the helm. Small privileges and big privileges are a relationship of ounces and pounds, with no qualitative difference. If small privileges are not prevented, it's like rats digging a big dam, the more they dig, the bigger the holes."

Comrade Ma Zhenhua is strict with himself and listens to the masses' criticisms. When the county Revolutionary Committee was established, it was the busy spring plowing season. Ma Zhenhua was filled with revolutionary enthusiasm and wanted to give his red heart to all the people of the county. At a standing committee meeting, he said, "Let's decide to weigh the 'three harms' (waterlogging, sand, and alkali) and see how heavy they are? Let's push production up and thoroughly change the backward face of Dongming." At his initiative, the Revolutionary Committee decided to assign eighty cadres to strengthen the production command department and set up eight offices, mainly to focus on production. As soon as the eight desks were set up, the revolutionary masses raised sharp criticisms, saying, "The county Revolutionary Committee organizing such a large production team to focus on production is going back to the old ways!"

Ma Zhenhua heard these criticisms and was shocked: how did it become going back to the old ways? It was clearly thinking about the eating, wearing, and living of 370,000 people! Later, he carefully pondered these criticisms, like eating pickled vegetables, initially a bit spicy, the more he chewed, the more flavorful. Indeed, to push production up, one cannot rely on organizing a large production team, but must emphasize proletarian politics. If one deviates from political leadership and only focuses on production, it is inevitable to repeat the old ways of a handful of capitalist roaders who "only focus on grain, cotton, and oil, and do not distinguish between enemies and friends." This is not going back to the old ways? Thinking of this, he was greatly shocked and realized that he had taken the wrong path. What to do? Chairman Mao said, "If mistakes are made, they must be corrected, the faster and more thoroughly the correction, the better." Ma Zhenhua followed Chairman Mao's teachings, went deep into the masses to listen to criticisms and seek opinions. Then, he also checked his erroneous thoughts at the expanded meeting of the standing committee and, together with everyone, studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "streamlining administration," deciding to take the road of emphasizing proletarian politics. After the meeting, he dissolved the eight offices and established a Mao Zedong Thought study office, organizing a Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team led by the standing committee of the county Revolutionary Committee, going straight to the production teams, and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. This way of doing things was welcomed by the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres. They said, "Old Ma listens to the masses' criticisms, accepts the masses' supervision, corrects mistakes, and is trustworthy."

Rain nourishes the seedlings, and a new generation is growing.

Comrade Ma Zhenhua is one of the thousands of new people. He loves Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought with all his heart.

After becoming the deputy chairman of the county Revolutionary Committee, no matter how heavy the tasks or how busy the work, he insisted on studying Chairman Mao's works every day. Deep into the night, when his comrades-in-arms had all gone to sleep, he was still diligently reading Chairman Mao's books. Some comrades advised him, "Old Ma, it's late, study tomorrow, this way of doing things will wear out your body!" Ma Zhenhua meaningfully replied, "The more you study, the clearer your mind, the stronger your bones, not studying will make you collapse!"

"For the theory of Marxism, one must be able to master it and apply it, the purpose of mastery is entirely for application." Comrade Ma Zhenhua firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teachings, applying Chairman Mao's instructions to consciously break selfishness and establish public-mindedness, and transform his worldview. Every night, he used Mao Zedong Thought as a standard to examine his words and deeds of the day. Comrade Ma Zhenhua called this practice "thought sifting." Whenever he "sifted thoughts," he first conducted his own "main battle," analyzing and criticizing, then reported to others, asking comrades to help with the "annihilation battle." Comrades all said, "Old Ma is a person who cannot tolerate even a hint of selfish thoughts."

    毛主席的好工人
    ——记山东省东明县革命委员会副主任、工人代表马振华同志
    一个年轻小伙子，从东方红牌的拖拉机下钻出来，满脸汗水，双手油垢。迎面走来一位同志笑着说：“你怎么还摸油泥啊？！”
    他回答说：“摸，摸一辈子哩。工人阶级的本色啥时候也不能变！”
    这个年轻小伙子就是山东省东明县革命委员会第一副主任、工人代表马振华同志。
      永远站在阶级斗争的第一线
    今年二月七日，山东省东明县革命委员会迎着阶级斗争的暴风雨胜利诞生了！
    这一天，马振华的心情特别激动，久久不能入睡。他打开《毛泽东选集》第四卷，反复地读着：“夺取全国胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步。……中国的革命是伟大的，但革命以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦。这一点现在就必须向党内讲明白，务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风。”毛主席的教导，字字如明灯，亮在眼前，句句似警钟，响在耳边。他仰望着毛主席的画像，默默地发出誓言：“毛主席啊，毛主席！我永远忠于您，坚决听您的话，保持工人阶级本色，在成绩和胜利面前决不骄傲自满，停步不前。我要象登山一样，把脚印丢在后边，向着无产阶级的‘公’字高峰登攀！”
    不久，县革命委员会一连接到几封贫下中农来信，要求帮助他们揭开马头公社靳庄大队的阶级斗争盖子。马振华听说后，激情满怀，正要挺身而出，转念又想到，自己是县革委会副主任，这个大队的问题是“老大难”的问题，一开头就去戳这么大的“马蜂窝”，要是三捅两戳搞不好，今后的工作怎么办？
    这时，伟大领袖毛主席的教导又响在耳边：“我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”马振华顿时感到脸上火辣辣的。自己为什么不敢挺身而出，主要是由于自己头脑里的“私”字在作怪，想保自己的“荣誉”。因此，没有见困难就上的精神。让这种“私”字发展下去，用不了多久，工人阶级的本色就会消褪。要保持工人阶级的本色，就要发扬大无畏的革命精神，永远站在阶级斗争的第一线，敢闯敢干敢革命！他决心按照毛主席的教导，到困难的地方去，到阶级斗争最尖锐的地方去。
    取得县革委会常委们的同意之后，马振华同志领着六个同志，来到了靳庄大队。他们吃、住在贫下中农社员家里。白天，边劳动，边向社员宣传毛主席的一系列最新指示；晚上，组织贫下中农开活学活用毛主席著作讲用会，进行忆苦思甜，斗私批修。帮助这个大队在毛泽东思想基础上实现了革命大联合。这时，一小撮阶级敌人为了挽救他们濒于死亡的命运，就用请吃喝来拉拢马振华同志。马振华当场就揭穿了阶级敌人的阴谋诡计，他义正辞严地说：“你们过去用糖衣炮弹打中了一些干部，今天我们用毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级革命派决不上你们的圈套。想拉我们下水吗？死了你们那贼心吧！”
    阶级敌人灰溜溜地走了。贫下中农笑了，说：
  “老马是咱贫下中农这条线上的人！”
    历经一个多月的激烈搏斗，靳庄大队的阶级斗争盖子终于揭开了，“马蜂窝”被戳掉了，一小撮阶级敌人被揪出来了！广大贫下中农扬眉吐气，革命、生产一片火红。
      紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署
    县革命工人造反指挥部的同志们说：“老马就一个心眼，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。”这话是有根据的。他常对同志们说：“咱们工人阶级肩头宽，担子重，啥时候也不能辜负毛主席他老人家的期望，啥时候也不能离开毛主席的革命路线。”
    前一时期，有一股极“左”思潮迷惑了革命队伍内部的一部分人。他们东奔西跑，鼓动一部分群众，从革命队伍中分出去，另立山头。并且大造舆论说：“县革命工人造反指挥部向右转了，不革命了。”县革命工人造反指挥部也连着召开了几个会议，组织力量准备反击。这时，双方犹如点着了信眼的炸药包，革命队伍面临着分裂的危险。
    在这一触即发的紧要关头，马振华同志站在无产阶级的党性立场上，首先说服工人组织撤销了反击的战斗计划。接着，他又遵照毛主席“必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道”的教导，带领县革命工人造反指挥部的常委，分别深入到工厂、学校宣传和落实毛主席的最新指示。经过一番深入细致的思想政治工作，分出去的部分群众很快认识了自己的错误，纷纷重新归队，避免了革命队伍的分裂，进一步巩固了革命大联合，发展了大好形势。现在，一提起这桩事，许多人颇有感触地说：“要不是老马和工人们胸怀宽广，顾全大局，双方非接‘火’不可。”“老马不愧为工人老大哥的代表。”
    在清理阶级队伍时，马振华发现有一个右派翻案集团在活动。这些家伙很诡秘，就象鸭子凫水一样，表面上看来很稳静，但肚皮下的黑爪子却在到处乱抓挠。因此，有些同志就不大警觉。当马振华在县革委会常委扩大会上提出来的时候，有的同志不同意，发生了分歧。怎么办？马振华同志亲自深入到群众中去调查研究，放手发动群众，很快就把这个右派反革命翻案集团的盖子揭开，打响了清理阶级队伍的第一炮，使那些思想上一度右倾的同志受到了很大教育。
          永远和群众心连心
    毛主席说：“必须坚持干部参加集体生产劳动的制度。我们党和国家的干部是普通劳动者，而不是骑在人民头上的老爷。”马振华同志把这一伟大教导，写在本子上，刻在心坎上，落实在行动上。
    马振华原是一个拖拉机修理工人。去年秋天，机耕队的同志下乡收机耕费，看到姚寨大队的一台柴油机坏了，社员们急得团团转。回到机关跟老马一说，第二天，老马就摸黑走了三十多里路，天亮赶到了姚寨大队。他拆了又装，装上又拆，折腾了大半天，终于把柴油机修好了。马振华同志饭没吃一口，水没喝一碗，搓了搓手上的油泥，就要走。社员们过意不去，就问他：“同志，你叫什么名字？”马振华抹了一把脸上的汗水，微笑着说：“叫——毛主席的工人。”
    马振华担任了县革委会副主任以后，他依然坚持参加集体生产劳动。他常说：“领导要实际，劳动很重要。”所以，一有空就回到原单位攥锤把，摸油泥，修理拖拉机。有的工人诙谐地说：“老马，这油泥黑糊糊的，摸一把，手就脏啦！”
    “手脏了不可怕，可怕的是脑袋脏。”马振华严肃地回答：“手脏了，洗洗就行了，脑袋脏了，就要发霉，就要变质！”在场的一位老工人听了，高兴地拍着马振华的肩膀说：“好！有这样的代表我们就放心了。”
    马振华能够经常参加集体生产劳动，是他自觉地破私立公的结果。
    今年麦收一开始，马振华就到一个生产队和社员一块抢收小麦。头两天劲头挺大，割了两天之后，腰痛腿酸，浑身难受。心想：今日算了吧，少我一个没关系，社员也不会计较。但是，干部参加集体生产劳动，“这是社会主义制度下一件带根本性的大事，它有助于克服官僚主义，防止修正主义和教条主义。”毛主席这一伟大教导，使马振华立刻意识到：要不要坚持下去，这不单是实现自己决心的问题，而是愿不愿打掉“官”气，要不要和群众同甘共苦、防修防变的大问题。过去自己开拖拉机时，起五更睡半夜地干，不知啥叫累。如今割了两天麦子，就撑不住了。这说明自己在不知不觉中“变”了，变得怕劳动了。爱劳动，思想感情就和劳动人民靠在一起；怕劳动，思想感情就和剥削阶级粘在一块。想到这里，马振华立刻走向田野，又和社员们一起割麦子去了。
    打这以后，马振华把参加集体生产劳动当作自己的一项制度。天长日久，群众把他当作普通一员，有话爱和他讲，有意见爱向他提，参加集体生产劳动成了他密切联系群众的好途径。从此，他劳动得更起劲，主动地抢重活、脏活干。他勉励自己说：“‘私’字破得狠，‘官’气不贴身，只有常劳动，才能和群众心连心！”
        自觉地接受群众监督
    马振华同志经常对战友们说：“咱们掌权了，千万不要闹特殊。特殊，是通向修正主义的滑梯。”
    县革委会成立的那天，同志们好心好意地给马振华同志收拾了一间单人办公室。屋内设有大棕床、圆藤椅、办公桌、文件橱、电话机……。马振华进屋一看那个阔气劲，二话没说，抱着铺盖卷就要走。同志们说：“这是你的办公室呀！”
      “这样的办公室我不要！”马振华幽默地说：“住在这里会生病。”说完，就搬回“老根据地”——县革命工人指挥部去了。直到现在，马振华同志没有单独的办公室，没有固定的单人宿舍，只有一个褪了色的黄挎包，整天背着它学习、劳动、开会、工作。群众说：“老马那个黄挎包，既是文件橱，又是办公桌，走到哪带到哪。老马活象当年的八路军！”
    马振华的爱人为了照顾他，要搬到县革委会机关来住，马振华说：“夫妻之间最重要的是互相帮助，互相促进，共同执行毛主席的革命路线。你要是搬到县里来住，生活上是方便一些，但那样会脱离群众，脱离自己的阶级兄弟。”
    这些，同志们看在眼里，想在心里。有的说：“天长日久，这样下去，老马的身子撑不住。”还有的说：“老马太认真，小小不言的，有啥了不起！”
    马振华却不这样认为。他说：“在生活‘关口’上，也要把住舵。小特殊和大特殊，是斤与两的关系，没有质的区别。如果小特殊不防止，就象耗子掏大坝，越掏窟窿越大。”
    马振华同志对自己要求严，对群众的批评听得进。县革委会成立的时候，正值春耕大忙时节。马振华满怀革命激情，恨不得把自己的红心掏给全县人民。在一次常委会议上，他说：咱们下决心掂一掂“三害”
  （涝、沙、盐碱）的份量到底有多大？把生产抓上去，彻底改变东明的落后面貌。在他的倡议下，革委会决定调八十名干部充实生产指挥部，增设八个办公室，主要是抓生产。八个摊摊刚摆好，革命群众就提出尖锐的批评说：“县革委会组织这么大的班子专抓生产是走回头路！”
    马振华听到这些批评，心里一震：怎么成了走回头路呢？明明是从三十七万人民的吃穿着想嘛！后来，他细琢磨这些批评，就象吃榨菜一样，开头有点辣，越嚼越有味。是啊，要把生产抓上去，不能靠组织庞大的生产班子，要靠突出无产阶级政治。如果离开政治挂帅，就生产抓生产，势必重蹈一小撮走资派“只抓粮棉油，不分敌我友”的覆辙，这不是走回头路是什么呢？想到这，他大吃一惊，认识到自己的路走错了。怎么办？毛主席说：“犯了错误则要求改正，改正得越迅速，越彻底，越好。”马振华遵照毛主席的教导，深入到群众中去，听取批评，征求意见。接着，他又在常委扩大会议上，检查了自己的错误思想，并和大家一起学习了毛主席关于“精兵简政”的教导，决心走突出无产阶级政治的道路。会后，就撤销了八个办公室，成立了一个学习毛主席著作办公室，组织起一支毛泽东思想宣传队，由县革委会常委率领，一竿子插到生产队，和广大贫下中农一起落实毛主席最新指示。这样做，受到了广大革命群众和革命干部的欢迎。他们说：老马听取群众批评，接受群众监督，错了就改，叫人信得过。
    雨露滋润禾苗壮，一代新人在成长。
    马振华同志就是千万个一代新人中的一个。他无限热爱毛主席，无限热爱毛泽东思想。
    他担任了县革命委员会副主任以后，不管任务多重，工作多忙，每天都要坚持学习毛主席著作。夜深了，战友们都睡了，他还在孜孜不倦地读毛主席的书。有的同志劝他说：“老马，不早啦，明天再学吧，这个搞法身子撑不住哇！”马振华意味深长地回答：“越学，心越明，骨头越硬，不学，才会垮哩！”
    “对于马克思主义的理论，要能够精通它、应用它，精通的目的全在于应用。”马振华同志牢记毛主席的教导，对毛主席的指示，学了就用，用于自觉地破私立公，改造世界观。每天晚上，他都以毛泽东思想为标准，检查自己一天的言行。马振华同志把这种作法，叫做思想“过筛”。每逢思想“过筛”时，他首先自己打“主攻战”，进行分析批判，然后再汇报给别人，请同志们帮助打“歼灭战”。同志们都说：“老马是一个容不得半点私心杂念的人。”
