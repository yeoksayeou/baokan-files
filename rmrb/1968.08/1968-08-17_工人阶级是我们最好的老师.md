The great teacher Chairman Mao has issued his latest directive: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully bring into play the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in all work. The working class should also, in the course of struggle, constantly raise its political consciousness." This is the greatest trust and greatest concern for the working class, and it is also the greatest education and greatest spur to all the military and civilian personnel of the nation.

In our work of supporting the left in the Beijing Guangming Road Chemical Factory, we have deeply come to understand that the working class is the main force of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the leading force in the Cultural Revolution and all work. We have seen with our own eyes how the working class holds the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought highest, is most loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, and follows the great helmsman Chairman Mao most closely. They study and implement every new directive and every battle command from the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, act on what they learn, and carry out the directives resolutely and thoroughly. Their class standpoint is the clearest, their love and hate the most distinct. They side with those who support Chairman Mao and listen to the proletarian headquarters, and they fight to the death with those who oppose Chairman Mao and defy the directives of the proletarian headquarters. They have truly done what is required, under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, to achieve unity of understanding, unity of steps, and unity of action, and to resolutely carry out the series of new directives from the proletarian headquarters.

The Guangming Road Chemical Factory produces an important raw material for making plastic covers for Chairman Mao's works. Last year, a counter-revolutionary element that had infiltrated the ranks of the working class once seized the leadership and, in a frenzy, whipped up a counter-revolutionary wind of economic opportunism and anarchism, inciting some young workers to stop production and sabotage the mass circulation of Chairman Mao's works, in an attempt to put pressure on the proletarian headquarters. However, the revolutionary workers of the factory immediately saw through their evil plot and bravely stood up to expose their crimes. The veteran workers, on the one hand, actively propagated Chairman Mao's latest directives to the deceived young workers, recalling bitterness and comparing sweetness with them, and struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism together; on the other hand, they worked day and night at the machines, shouldering the double burden of revolution and production. They declared proudly: "Chairman Mao calls on us to grasp revolution and promote production, so we must carry out the revolution with thunderous force and production with surging momentum! No matter what the situation, we must not be the least bit vague or make the slightest compromise!" In this way, the deceived masses quickly came to their senses, firmly guarded their battle stations, and defended Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The broad revolutionary masses, with great heroism, overcame numerous difficulties and raised production levels month by month. In July of this year, they created a new record since the founding of the factory, and the enemy's plots and tricks suffered a shameful defeat.

When Chairman Mao issued his latest directive that "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat under the conditions of socialism to overthrow the bourgeoisie and all other exploiting classes, it is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and its leadership and the broad revolutionary people on the one hand and the Kuomintang reactionaries on the other, and it is a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie," the revolutionary cadres and workers of the factory studied it through the night, resolutely carried it out, and immediately began the work of cleaning up the class ranks. Everyone used their brains and everyone sharpened their eyes, and the masses were fully mobilized. They quickly rooted out a handful of hidden class enemies. At this time, the class enemies played tricks, turned black into white, and created divisions within the revolutionary ranks, attempting to confuse the two different types of contradictions and sabotage Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. The broad revolutionary masses, in accordance with Chairman Mao's great teachings on correctly handling contradictions among the people, put the public interest first, acted consistently, and strictly distinguished between enemy contradictions and contradictions among the people, separating a handful of bad leaders from the broad masses of an organization, and separating active counter-revolutionaries from the masses who made mistakes. They treated the deceived masses with full enthusiasm and patience, and they exposed and struck hard at the class enemies. They united all forces that could be united, forming a vast revolutionary army, and struck accurately and fiercely at a handful of class enemies. Old worker Ma Xiuzhi is a mother of two children. To carry out and implement Chairman Mao's series of latest directives, she always comes early and leaves late, putting aside personal and family matters. The other day, her child fell ill, and comrades advised her to take a few days off to take care of the child. She said: "I have sworn to Chairman Mao: I would rather die, I would rather shed blood, but I will not abandon Chairman Mao's revolutionary line! I said it, and I will do it! The child has a slight illness, how can I leave my battle station?" That night, she prepared her speech for the struggle meeting in the factory until the early morning of the next day. Ma Xiuzhi is an ordinary worker, and her spirit of unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao is so noble!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The industrial proletariat is the leading force of our revolution," "The entire history of revolution has proved that without the leadership of the working class, the revolution will fail, and with the leadership of the working class, the revolution will win." The working class is our best teacher and will forever be our model to learn from. To learn from the working class and to master their lofty revolutionary spirit is an important guarantee for us to advance bravely along the revolutionary course pointed out by Chairman Mao, and it is an important guarantee for the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, if we honestly become students of the working class and fight together with the working class, we will have the correct direction, the greatest strength, and boundless wisdom. No matter what difficulties and obstacles we encounter, we will not be stopped from advancing to victory, and no matter how cunning the enemy is, they will not escape their doom!

    工人阶级是我们最好的老师
    北京空军某部　高兴烈
    伟大导师毛主席发出最新指示：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”这是对工人阶级的最大信任，最大关怀，也是对全国军民的最大教育，最大鞭策。
    我们在北京光明路化工厂支左工作中，深深认识到：工人阶级是无产阶级文化大革命的主力军，是文化大革命和一切工作的领导力量。我们亲眼看到，工人阶级把毛泽东思想红旗举得最高，对伟大领袖毛主席最忠，跟伟大统帅毛主席最紧。他们对以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的每一个最新指示、每一项战斗号令，学了就做，言行一致，坚决照办，彻底执行。他们阶级观点最明确，爱憎最分明，谁拥护毛主席，听无产阶级司令部的话，就跟谁亲；谁反对毛主席，违抗无产阶级司令部的指示，就和谁拚。他们真正做到了，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的领导下，统一认识，统一步伐，统一行动，坚决贯彻执行无产阶级司令部的一系列最新指示。
    光明路化工厂生产一种制作毛主席著作塑料皮的重要原料。去年，混进工人阶级队伍的反革命分子一度篡夺了领导权，丧心病狂地刮起一股反革命经济主义和无政府主义的妖风，煽动一部分青年工人停产，破坏毛主席著作的大量发行，妄图以此来给无产阶级司令部施加压力。但是，这个厂的革命职工一眼就识破了他们的罪恶阴谋，勇敢地站出来揭露他们的罪行。老师傅们一面积极地向受蒙蔽的青年反复宣传毛主席的最新指示，和他们一起忆苦思甜，一起斗私批修；一面不分昼夜地守在机器旁，挑起了革命和生产两副重担。他们豪迈地说：“毛主席叫我们抓革命促生产，我们就要把革命搞得轰轰烈烈，把生产搞得热气腾腾！不管遇到什么情况，也不能有半点含糊，打半点折扣！”就这样，受蒙蔽的群众很快地觉悟过来，坚守战斗岗位，捍卫了毛主席的革命路线。广大革命职工以大无畏的英雄气概，战胜重重困难，使生产水平逐月直线上升。今年七月，他们创造了建厂以来最高的纪录，使阶级敌人的阴谋诡计遭到了可耻的失败。
    当毛主席发出“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续”的最新指示后，厂里的革命干部、革命职工连夜学习，坚决贯彻，立即开始了清理阶级队伍的工作，人人开动脑筋，个个擦亮眼睛，群众充分发动起来了，很快就把一小撮暗藏的阶级敌人挖了出来。这时，阶级敌人玩弄花招，颠倒黑白，在革命队伍中制造分裂，妄图混淆两类性质不同的矛盾，破坏毛主席的伟大战略部署。广大革命职工遵照毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的伟大教导，“公”字当头，言行一致，严格地区分敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾，把一个组织的坏头头同这个组织的广大群众区别开来，把现行反革命分子同犯错误的群众区别开来。他们对受蒙蔽的群众，满腔热情，耐心帮助；对阶级敌人，坚决揭露，狠狠打击。他们团结了一切可以团结的力量，组成浩浩荡荡的革命大军，稳、准、狠地打击了一小撮阶级敌人。老工人马秀芝是两个孩子的妈妈，为了贯彻落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，她总是早来晚走，把个人和家庭的事置之度外。前几天，她的孩子病了，同志们劝她请几天假照看一下。她说：“我向毛主席宣过誓：头可断，血可流，毛主席的革命路线不可丢！我说了就要算数！孩子有点病，我怎么能离开战斗岗位呢！”那天晚上，她在厂里准备批斗大会发言稿，直到第二天凌晨。马秀芝是一位普通的工人，她这种无限忠于毛主席的品质是多么高尚啊！
    毛主席教导我们：“工业无产阶级是我们革命的领导力量”，“整个革命历史证明，没有工人阶级的领导，革命就要失败，有了工人阶级的领导，革命就胜利了。”工人阶级是我们最好的老师，永远是我们学习的榜样。拜工人阶级为师，把工人阶级崇高的革命精神学到手，是我们永远沿着毛主席指引的革命航道奋勇前进的重要保证，是无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的重要保证。在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部领导下，老老实实地当工人阶级的小学生，和工人阶级团结、战斗在一起，就有最正确的方向，最强大的力量，最无穷的智慧，无论什么艰难险阻也挡不住我们胜利前进，无论什么狡猾的敌人也逃不脱灭亡的命运！
