The Chinese people are the true friends of the Yemeni people

— Chinese Water Resources Engineering Technicians in Yemen

Following the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao: "Our common enemy is American imperialism. We are all on the same front, and we need to unite and support each other." Last November, water resources engineering technicians from our country arrived in the Yemen Arab Republic to conduct water source exploration and drilling for the Sana'a-Husayyah section of the road water supply.

Who is the true friend?

"Friends have true and false, but through practice, one can see who is a true friend and who is a false friend."

Last November and December were the times when the Yemeni people faced a new severe test.

The most vicious enemy of the world's people, American imperialism, and its lackeys incited the reactionary forces in Yemen to attempt to overthrow the young Yemen Arab Republic by force. In early December, they finally took open military action. The Yemeni reactionaries first cut off some roads, infiltrated the outskirts of the capital Sana'a of the Yemen Arab Republic, and controlled some high points near Sana'a. However, the Yemeni reactionaries' sabotage was met with a head-on blow from the Yemeni people. In the face of the fierce resistance of the armed forces of the Yemen Arab Republic, their evil plot was foiled.

As soon as the war began, the personnel of the Soviet revisionist clique's embassy in Yemen and their "experts" fled from Sana'a in panic and disarray. The Taiz-Hodeidah road "assisted" by the Soviet revisionist clique in Yemen stopped construction, and the farm was closed... They not only fled from Sana'a and other places in Yemen to Hodeidah like rats, but also fled back to their lair from Hodeidah like startled birds. The cowardly face of the Soviet revisionists was spat upon and disapproved by the broad masses of the Yemeni people. Yemeni friends said: Friends should share both joy and sorrow. Friends who only share joy but not sorrow are not true friends.

The Chinese embassy in Yemen and all the engineering technicians held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly guarded their posts, and remained in Sana'a during the days of shelling. When shells fell on the Sana'a textile factory, Chinese engineering technicians still calmly worked with Yemeni workers there.

After arriving in Yemen, Chinese water resources engineering technicians immediately began preparations for the construction of the first well for the road water supply. They started construction on December 10 in the Jeddah region, about 10 kilometers north of Sana'a, during the time when the Yemeni reactionaries were making their last struggles. Chinese water resources engineering technicians, remembering the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, made up their minds, fearing no sacrifice, and went out early and returned late every day, eating in the open air at noon, and not resting on Sundays. They overcame various difficulties in the construction process, and after more than 20 days of continuous work, they finally completed all the work of the well.

A responsible person from the Sana'a-Sada Road Engineering Management Bureau of Yemen praised the stance of Chinese engineering technicians in a conversation with us, saying: "The Russians ran away, but Chinese friends remained in Sana'a and worked with the Yemeni people. You are our true friends. The Yemeni people thank the Chinese people for this friendly stance."

Wholeheartedly serving the Yemeni people

Our team is "working thoroughly for the people's interests."

In early May this year, Chinese technicians moved to the Mamala area, about 20 kilometers north of Sana'a, to conduct water source exploration and drilling.

The Mamala area has never had a well dug before. Local Yemeni friends rely on building water pools to collect rainwater for living. The water pools are far from the villages and homes, making it difficult to fetch water. The rainwater in the pools is exposed to the atmosphere year-round, with algae growing on the edges, mixed with dust and bacteria. Adults and children in the area have been infected with a serious skin disease due to long-term consumption of this dirty water, making it difficult to treat. For generations, they have longed to drink well water!

The Mamala area is composed of basalt. The repeated eruptions of basalt have made the hydrogeological conditions here complex. In the past, foreigners have also drilled wells here, but none have been successful. In the absence of any previous data to refer to, we encountered a series of difficulties during the drilling process in the Mamala area.

During the construction of the well, we first encountered the problem of severe water leakage in the rock. The local basalt has many pores, so the circulating water injected into the hole to cool the drill bit does not come back up but leaks away completely. Therefore, every time we drill down, we need to inject a large amount of water into the hole. Since there are no wells nearby, we had to use water trucks to transport water from the Jeddah well, 10 kilometers away. Although the three Yemeni drivers working with us traveled back and forth over mountains and valleys from morning to night without complaint, it was still not enough to meet the drilling needs. After learning about this situation, local Yemeni friends voluntarily offered to provide us with water from the pool near the well site. We used the water from this pool to ensure the normal operation of the drilling machine. However, the deeper we drilled, the more severe the water leakage became. In a few days, we used up all the water in the pool. Later, Yemeni friends allowed us to use a larger pool about two kilometers away from the well site, helping to solve part of the water shortage problem.

After the drilling depth reached the designed underground water level, we measured the underground water level every day. However, as the depth increased, the underground water level continued to drop: from 52 meters to 62 meters, and then from 62 meters to 77 meters. Faced with such serious difficulties, we repeatedly studied the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao on "daring to struggle and daring to win," "making up our minds, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory," and remained unshakable, continuing to drill down. Finally, we detected a stable underground water level at a deeper depth. When everyone heard the news, they were overjoyed and enthusiastically cheered the great victory of invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

During the drilling construction in the Mamala area, countless Yemeni friends came to visit every day and asked us: Friends, is there water? A 70-year-old Yemeni elder named Ali Abdullah came to the well site every day to visit us and asked, "Is there water?" After asking, he sat in the corner of the drilling machine's workbench, watching us work. The Yemeni people's concern for the well drilling further inspired our enthusiasm to serve the Yemeni people. Chinese water resources engineering technicians made up their minds to overcome all difficulties and definitely drill the first mechanized well in the history of the Mamala area.

With the strong support and active cooperation of Yemeni friends, we finally completed all the work of the first mechanized well in the history of the Mamala area in a short time. When the first clean and sweet well water was brought up from the deep underground, the Yemeni friends on the scene eagerly drank the sweet well water, shed tears of joy, and shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

The Yemeni people love Chairman Mao

"The just struggles of the peoples of the world will receive and will continue to receive the resolute support of the 650 million Chinese people."

During the days of interacting with Yemeni friends, Chinese water resources engineering technicians deeply felt the Yemeni people's boundless love for the great leader of the world revolutionary people, Chairman Mao.

Whether on the streets or in our work and living places, many Yemeni friends often came to us to sincerely ask for Chairman Mao's badges and the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." When Yemeni friends received a shiny gold Chairman Mao badge or a red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," their faces immediately lit up with a happy smile, and they happily said to us: "Friend, thank you. China is good! Long live Chairman Mao!"

On June 3 this year, the Sana'a-Sada Road Office in the Mamala area held a completion celebration for the first mechanized well. Invited to attend the meeting were Yemen's Minister of Public Works Abdulah Kushmi, Deputy Minister, and hundreds of local tribal elders and masses.

After the celebration began, the people of Mamala expressed their congratulations in the highest Arab national ceremony—sacrificing a cow. Then, the Director of the Sana'a-Sada Road Engineering Management Bureau, Muhammad Ali Abu Rajjal, speaking on behalf of the Ministry of Public Works, said: "We express our sincere thanks and high respect to the People's Republic of China, led by the beloved leader Chairman Mao Zedong, our friend. The beloved leader Chairman Mao Zedong teaches the peoples of all countries how to struggle for liberation, how to work, and how to fight against the reactionaries and colonialists!" The attendees shouted: "Long live the friendship between the peoples of China and Yemen!"

All water resources engineering technicians working in Yemen are excited and proud that our great leader Chairman Mao enjoys such high prestige among the Yemeni people!

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Even if our work has achieved extremely great results, there is no reason to be arrogant and self-satisfied." "No matter how big or small a country is, it has its own strengths and weaknesses." In the future work, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, be modest, prudent, guard against arrogance and impatience, and strive to further consolidate and develop the friendship and cooperation between the peoples of China and Yemen!

    中国人民是也门人民真正的朋友
    ——中国水源工程技术人员在也门
    遵照我们伟大领袖毛主席的教导：“我们共同的敌人是美帝国主义，我们大家都是站在一条战线上，大家需要互相团结互相支持。”我国援助也门的水源工程技术人员于去年十一月到达了阿拉伯也门共和国，进行萨那—候司段公路供水的水源勘探和钻井工作。
      谁是真正的朋友“朋友有真假，但通过实践可以看清谁是真朋友，谁是假朋友。”
    去年十一和十二月，正是也门人民面临着一场新的严峻考验的时刻。
    世界人民最凶恶的敌人美帝国主义及其走狗，唆使也门反动势力企图用武力颠覆年轻的阿拉伯也门共和国。十二月初，它们终于采取了公开的军事行动。也门反动派首先切断了一些公路交通，窜抵阿拉伯也门共和国首都萨那周围，并控制了萨那附近的某些制高点。但是，也门反动派的这种捣乱遭到了也门人民的迎头痛击。在阿拉伯也门共和国武装部队英勇抵抗面前，它们的这种罪恶阴谋破产了。
    战争刚一开始，苏修叛徒集团驻也门使馆人员及其“专家”就惊慌万状、狼狈不堪地从萨那逃跑了。苏修叛徒集团“援助”也门建设的塔伊兹—荷台达公路停工了，农场关门了……他们不但从萨那及也门其它地方抱头鼠窜地跑到了荷台达，而且又从荷台达象惊弓之鸟纷纷逃回了他们的老巢。苏修叛徒这种怕死的丑恶嘴脸遭到了也门广大人民群众的唾弃和不满。也门朋友说：朋友应该同甘共苦，只同甘不共苦的朋友不是真正的朋友。
    我国驻也使馆和全体工程技术人员，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚守工作岗位，在炮火纷飞的日子里，仍然留在萨那。当炮弹落到萨那纺织厂时，中国工程技术人员仍旧镇静地和也门工人一起在那里坚持工作。
    我国水源工程技术人员到达也门后，便立即投入了公路供水第一眼井的施工准备工作。他们于去年十二月十日在距萨那以北十公里的哲德尔地区开始施工期间，正是也门反动派进行垂死挣扎的时候。我国水源工程技术人员，牢记伟大领袖毛主席的教导，下定决心，不怕牺牲，每天冒着也门反动派的炮火，早出晚归，中午在野外露天吃饭，星期天不休息。他们克服了施工过程中的各种困难，这样，经过二十多天连续作战，终于胜利地完成了该井的全部工作。
    也门萨那—萨达公路工程管理局一位负责人在和我们的一次谈话中，热情赞扬我国工程技术人员的这种立场，他说：“苏联人跑了，中国朋友们仍留在萨那和也门人民一道坚持工作。你们是我们真正的朋友。也门人民感谢中国人民的这种友好立场。”
    全心全意地为也门人民服务我们这个队伍“是彻底地为人民的利益工作的”。
    今年五月初，中国技术人员搬到了距萨那以北二十公里的马马拉地区，进行水源勘探和钻井工作。
    马马拉地区自古以来没有挖成一眼水井。附近的也门朋友全靠修筑水池积蓄雨水过活。水池远离各村各家，顶一趟水很不容易。水池的雨水常年累月暴露在大气之中，池边长满了绿苔，沾染了许多灰尘和病菌。附近的大人小孩，由于长期饮用这种脏水，普遍地感染一种很严重的脓疮皮肤病，很难医治。他们祖祖辈辈多么渴望能够喝到井水啊！
    马马拉地区是由玄武岩构成的。玄武岩的多次喷发造成了这里的水文地质条件的复杂性。过去，外国人也曾在这里打过井，但都没有成功。在没有任何前人资料可供参考的情况下，在马马拉地区打井的施工过程中，我们遇到了一系列困难。
    在该井施工过程中，首先，我们遇到了岩石严重漏水的困难。当地玄武岩气孔特别多，因此，注入孔内作为冷却钻头用的循环水反不上来，全部漏掉了。这样，每当向下钻进时，就需要把大量的水注入孔内。附近没有水井，我们只好到远离十公里的哲德尔井用水车运水。尽管和我们一起工作的三名也门司机每天从早到晚翻山越岭、不辞劳累地往返运水，但是，仍然不能满足钻进的需要。当地也门朋友了解了这种情况后，主动地向我们提出，愿意把井场附近水池中的水供给我们使用。我们用该池中的水，保证了钻机的正常运转。但是，越往下钻进，漏水现象变得越加严重。不几天，我们就把该池中的水用完了。以后，也门朋友又让我们使用在距井场两公里左右的地方的一个更大的水池。帮助我们解决了一部分缺水的困难。
    当钻孔深度达到了设计的地下水位以后，我们每天都要测量一下地下水位。但是，随着孔深的增加，地下水位在不断地下降：从五十二米下降到六十二米，又从六十二米下降到七十七米。在遇到这样严重困难的情况下，我们反复学习了伟大领袖毛主席关于“敢于斗争、敢于胜利”、“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”等一系列教导，毫不动摇，坚持继续向下钻进。最后，终于在更深的地下，测到了稳定的地下水位。当大家知道这个消息后，都感到万分高兴，热烈欢呼战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    在马马拉地区打井施工期间，每天不知有多少也门朋友前来参观，并问我们：朋友，有没有水？一位名叫阿里·阿卜杜拉的七十高龄的也门老人每天照例都要来到井场看望我们，关心地问我们一声：“有水吗？”问完，他便坐在钻机工作台的角落里，看着我们工作。也门老百姓如此关心打井，进一步激发了我们为也门人民服务的热情。中国水源工程技术人员，下定决心，排除万难，一定要在马马拉地区打出有史以来的第一眼机井。
    在也门朋友的大力支持和积极配合下，我们终于在较短的时间内胜利地完成了马马拉地区自古以来第一眼机井的全部工作。当又清又甜的井水第一次从地下深处取出来时，在场的也门朋友互相争喝着清甜的井水，激动地流出了幸福的眼泪，高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    也门人民热爱毛主席“世界各国人民的正义斗争，都得到并将继续得到六亿五千万中国人民的坚决支持。”
    我国水源工程技术人员在和也门朋友相处的日子里，深深地感到也门人民无限热爱世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席。
    无论是在街上，或者是在我们工作和居住的地方，经常有许多也门朋友前来向我们恳切地索取毛主席像章和《毛主席语录》。当也门朋友得到一枚金光闪闪的毛主席像章或一本红彤彤的《毛主席语录》时，脸上便立刻露出一种幸福的微笑，并高兴地对我们说：“朋友，谢谢你。中国好！毛主席万岁！”
    今年六月三日，也门萨那—萨达公路办公室在马马拉地区举行了第一眼机井竣工庆祝大会。应邀参加大会的有也门政府公共工程部长阿卜杜拉·库什米、部长助理以及当地部落长老和群众等数百人。
    庆祝大会开始后，马马拉地区的老百姓用阿拉伯民族的最高礼节——宰牛表示祝贺。接着，萨那—萨达公路工程管理局局长穆罕默德·阿里·阿布·雷贾勒在代表公共工程部的讲话中说：“我们向以敬爱的领袖毛泽东主席为首的中华人民共和国——我们的朋友致以诚恳的感谢和崇高的敬意。敬爱的领袖毛泽东主席教导各国人民如何争取解放、如何劳动、如何为反对反动派和殖民主义而斗争！”到会群众高呼：“也中两国人民友谊万岁！”
    全体在也门工作的水源工程技术人员都为我们伟大领袖毛主席在也门人民中间享有这样崇高的威望而感到欢欣鼓舞和无比自豪！
    我们伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“即使我们的工作得到了极其伟大的成绩，也没有任何值得骄傲自大的理由。”“国无论大小，都各有长处和短处。”在今后的工作中，我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，谦虚、谨慎、戒骄、戒躁，为进一步巩固和发展中也两国人民之间的友谊和合作而努力！
