Workers and students in Latin America are engaged in a relentless struggle against dictatorship, garnering widespread sympathy and support from various strata of the people.

Workers and students in several Latin American countries are bravely and continuously fighting against the brutal oppression and rule of U.S. imperialism and its agents, and for the protection of their own rights and interests. Their struggles have won the sympathy and support of people from all walks of life.

In Argentina, workers at the Renault-Ika automobile factory in Córdoba province, after staging a fierce protest on the 13th, again took to the streets in the provincial capital, Córdoba, on the 14th to protest against the factory owner's persecution of workers.

The authorities sent in police to brutally suppress the protest. When the reactionary police attacked the workers with tear gas, students from the School of Engineering welcomed the workers from the Renault-Ika automobile factory and together with them bravely fought back against the police with stones.

In Ecuador, residents of Chibunga in Manabí province held a protest demonstration on July 30 to condemn the reactionary military police for killing students and to firmly support the students' just demands.

Students from a middle school in Chibunga began a strike in mid-July to demand increased educational funding and improved teaching conditions.

On July 29, the provincial governor visited the school to deceive the students but was detained by them. The authorities then sent troops to the city to suppress the students by force. One student was killed, and many were injured and arrested.

This outrage sparked public indignation among the local residents, who immediately launched extensive activities in support of the students' struggle and blocked the roads leading from the city to other cities.

In Bolivia, the largest city, La Paz, university students held a general strike on the 13th and 14th to protest against the reactionary policies of the pro-American military dictatorship and to demand the release of students arrested for participating in demonstrations. Students from La Paz University also held a protest meeting, where they shouted, "Long live the people's war!" On the 16th, La Paz university students again held a protest march in the city center.
