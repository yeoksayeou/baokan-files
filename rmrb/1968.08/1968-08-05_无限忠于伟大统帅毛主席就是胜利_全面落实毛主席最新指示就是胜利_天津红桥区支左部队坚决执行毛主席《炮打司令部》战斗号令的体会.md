The People’s Liberation Army’s left-supporting troops stationed in Tianjin’s Hongqiao District, with unlimited loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, and with deep hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev, reviewed the great course of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past two years. They discussed the great achievements made in resolutely executing Chairman Mao’s “Bombard the Headquarters” battle order. Everyone unanimously expressed that at this crucial moment of seizing the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, be unconditionally loyal to the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, resolutely carry out and thoroughly implement every instruction from the proletarian headquarters, unify our will, steps, and actions under the orders of the proletarian headquarters, closely follow Chairman Mao’s great strategic deployment, deeply and persistently carry out the revolutionary criticism, thoroughly eliminate the pernicious influence of the Chinese Khrushchev’s counter-revolutionary revisionist line in all aspects, complete the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation in various departments, and seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Resolutely executing the battle orders of Chairman Mao’s proletarian headquarters is the greatest loyalty to Chairman Mao.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: “All our military personnel must always remember that we are the great People’s Liberation Army, the army led by the great Communist Party of China. As long as we always follow the party’s instructions, we will definitely be victorious.” From the first day the troops arrived at the left-supporting front in Hongqiao District, they thoroughly studied Chairman Mao’s theory, line, policy, method, and principle regarding the continuation of the proletarian dictatorship’s revolution, and thoroughly studied the various instructions from the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. They raised their awareness of the two-line struggle to a high level, deepened their hatred for the class enemy, and firmly established their loyalty to Chairman Mao. Comrades deeply realized that loyalty to Chairman Mao and the proletarian headquarters means adhering to the revolutionary academic style advocated by Chairman Mao, learning and applying his latest instructions, and resolutely executing them. Whether or not we can resolutely execute every instruction from Chairman Mao’s proletarian headquarters is a major issue concerning whether the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao can be implemented, a major issue concerning the success or failure of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and a fundamental mark of loyalty to Chairman Mao.

Last September, Chairman Mao issued the latest instruction: “Within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interests. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions.” The left-supporting troops, with the greatest enthusiasm and the fastest speed, conveyed and implemented this latest instruction from Chairman Mao to all revolutionary masses in the district. The People’s Liberation Army’s Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at San Tiao Shi, with twelve people, reached fifty-eight factories in one day and one night, propagating Chairman Mao’s latest instruction. The revolutionary masses deeply understood Chairman Mao’s latest instruction, acted quickly, and executed it resolutely. In a very short time, the entire district achieved revolutionary great unity. The originally planned mobilization meeting for achieving revolutionary great unity turned into a victory celebration meeting for achieving revolutionary great unity. Soon, the proletarian headquarters issued a call for revolutionary great unity according to systems, and the left-supporting troops immediately responded, going to various factories at night for propaganda, and immediately setting up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, quickly promoting revolutionary great unity in the entire district according to systems and groups.

Every time Chairman Mao issues a battle order, they execute it promptly and resolutely. Sometimes, their eyes are red from fatigue, and their bodies are thin from exhaustion, but their hearts are always sweet. They proudly say: “We fight for Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line and die for Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line. Unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao’s proletarian headquarters is our highest duty!”

Closely connecting with the masses is the key to more consciously implementing every instruction from Chairman Mao’s proletarian headquarters.

The left-supporting troops in Hongqiao District deeply felt in their struggle practice that Chairman Mao’s latest instructions and the orders from the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin reflect the objective laws of domestic and international class struggle and represent the fundamental interests of the proletariat and the working people. Only by combining them with reality, going to the masses, and going to the fiery struggle to learn and implement them, can we truly understand the great significance of Chairman Mao’s instructions and more consciously implement Chairman Mao’s latest instructions.

In mid-February this year, the Tianjin Municipal Revolutionary Committee, based on Chairman Mao’s instruction to establish a three-in-one leading body, called for a high tide of establishing grassroots revolutionary committees. At that time, some comrades did not fully understand and thought that the conditions for achieving a red district were not yet mature. However, they realized that this was a great instruction from Chairman Mao, an order from the proletarian headquarters, and immediately took action, enthusiastically joining the battle. They mobilized thousands of workers to form workers’ Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, going to factories, schools, streets, and offices to propagate Chairman Mao’s latest instructions. Once Chairman Mao’s instructions met the masses, they immediately produced tremendous material force, and the entire district quickly presented a good situation of establishing grassroots revolutionary committees. One noon, the workers’ Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team from the industrial fifth district and the small third district came to the knitting materials factory to propagate Chairman Mao’s latest instructions. Many workers had already gone off duty. The propaganda team members immediately went to the workers’ homes for propaganda. The workers were overjoyed, saying, “We have been waiting for this day for a long time!” They hurried back to the factory to discuss the issue of achieving revolutionary three-in-one. With the help of the propaganda team, the factory revolutionary committee was born at ten o’clock that night. In this way, more than five hundred and forty grassroots units in the entire district quickly established revolutionary committees, achieving a red district in the Tianjin urban area first.

This incident gave the left-supporting personnel a vivid lesson. They deeply realized that quickly establishing grassroots revolutionary committees is an urgent need to fully implement Chairman Mao’s latest instructions and seize the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution. It is a necessary trend in the development of revolutionary and class struggle situations and also the strong wish of revolutionary masses. Chairman Mao’s latest instructions are far-sighted great scientific predictions and the fundamental interests and urgent requirements of the broad revolutionary masses. We do not understand because we do not know the wishes and requirements of the masses. Everyone said: “Chairman Mao is the most beloved great leader of the revolutionary masses. The revolutionary masses love Chairman Mao the most and listen to Chairman Mao’s words the most. The closer we are to the masses, the deeper our belief in Mao Zedong Thought, the more we understand Chairman Mao’s latest instructions, and the higher our consciousness in implementing Chairman Mao’s latest instructions.”

The key lies in having a leadership team that is unconditionally loyal to the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao.

The temporary party committee of the left-supporting troops in Hongqiao District deeply understands that implementing the series of latest instructions from Chairman Mao and the proletarian headquarters is crucial to leadership. After the temporary party committee was established, the first thing it did was to decide to highlight proletarian politics and strengthen the revolutionary construction of the party committee in executing the left-supporting work. Over the past two years, they have taken loyalty to Chairman Mao and the proletarian headquarters as the firm and correct political direction of the left-supporting work and as the fundamental task of the revolutionary construction of the party committee and the troops. They have taken the implementation of Chairman Mao’s series of latest instructions as their most sacred duty.

In April this year, Chairman Mao pointed out profoundly: “The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is essentially a great political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and its led broad revolutionary masses and the Kuomintang reactionaries. It is a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie.” On the day Chairman Mao’s latest instruction was issued, the temporary party committee organized all left-supporting comrades to study it seriously. Everyone raised their class struggle consciousness, recognized the new situation, new characteristics, and new trends of class struggle, and quickly joined the battle of cleaning up class ranks. When the struggle against the enemy reached its peak, a small handful of class enemies appeared in an ultra-leftist guise, trying to confuse the two types of different nature contradictions and attempting to lead the movement astray. At this critical moment, the temporary party committee organized all left-supporting comrades to study Chairman Mao’s latest instructions and the teachings on strictly distinguishing between the two types of different nature contradictions, thus dispelling the fog, correcting the course, and smashing the evil plots of the class enemies. The struggle against the enemy was carried out more vigorously. Recently, in the situation where the struggle against the enemy has achieved major victories, the temporary party committee organized all left-supporting comrades to study Chairman Mao’s latest instructions and the teachings of “It is better to pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining strength than to seek fame like King Xiang Yu.” They emphasized that efforts should be made to expose and criticize the small handful of class enemies deeply, making the struggle against the enemy develop step by step. The temporary party committee of the left-supporting troops is like this. They insist on arming the minds of all left-supporting personnel and the broad revolutionary masses with Mao Zedong Thought, leading everyone to advance along the course indicated by Chairman Mao, completely, thoroughly, and solidly implementing Chairman Mao’s series of latest instructions.

On the eve of the second anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao’s “Bombard the Headquarters” big-character poster, the left-supporting troops stationed in Tianjin’s Hongqiao District and the broad revolutionary masses reviewed the two-year course of closely following Chairman Mao’s great strategic deployment and implementing Chairman Mao’s latest instructions. They deeply felt that unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao is victory! Seriously implementing every instruction, order, and notice issued by Chairman Mao’s proletarian headquarters is victory!

　　无限忠于伟大统帅毛主席就是胜利
　　全面落实毛主席最新指示就是胜利
　　——天津红桥区支左部队坚决执行毛主席《炮打司令部》战斗号令的体会
    本报讯　人民解放军驻天津红桥区支左部队，怀着对伟大统帅毛主席的无限忠诚，带着对中国赫鲁晓夫的刻骨仇恨，回顾了两年来无产阶级文化大革命的伟大历程，畅谈了坚决执行毛主席《炮打司令部》的战斗号令所取得的伟大成绩。大家一致表示，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的关键时刻，一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，无限忠于以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，对毛主席的无产阶级司令部的每一个指示都要坚决照办，彻底执行，在无产阶级司令部的号令下统一意志，统一步伐，统一行动，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，深入持久地开展革命大批判，彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线在各方面的恶劣影响，完成各部门的斗、批、改任务，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级司令部的战斗号令是对毛主席最大的忠诚
    伟大统帅毛主席教导我们：“我全军将士必须时刻牢记，我们是伟大的人民解放军，是伟大的中国共产党领导的队伍。只要我们时刻遵守党的指示，我们就一定胜利。”驻红桥区支左部队从来到支左前线的第一天起，就大学毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续革命的理论、路线、方针、方法和政策，大学以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的各项指示，把两条路线斗争觉悟提得高高的，把对阶级敌人的仇恨搞得深深的，把对毛主席的“忠”字树得牢牢的。同志们深深认识到，忠于毛主席，忠于毛主席的无产阶级司令部，就要坚持毛主席倡导的革命学风，对毛主席的最新指示学了就用，坚决执行。能不能坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级司令部的每一个指示，这是关系到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线能不能得到贯彻的大事，关系到无产阶级文化大革命成败的大事，是忠不忠于毛主席的根本标志。
    去年九月，毛主席发出了“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织”最新指示，支左部队以最大的热情、最快的速度，向全区革命群众传达贯彻毛主席这一最新指示。驻三条石的人民解放军毛泽东思想宣传队，十二个人，一天一夜就到了五十八个工厂，宣传了毛主席的最新指示。革命群众对毛主席的最新指示理解得深，行动得快，执行得坚决，只用了很短的时间，全区就实现了革命的大联合。原计划实现革命大联合的动员大会变成了实现革命大联合的报捷大会。不久，无产阶级司令部又发出了关于按照系统实行革命大联合的号召，支左部队闻风而动，连夜到各个工厂进行宣传，立即开办了毛泽东思想学习班，迅速促成了全区按系统、按班组的革命大联合。
    毛主席每发出一个战斗号令，他们都是雷厉风行，坚决地贯彻落实。有时，大家眼睛熬红了，人累瘦了，但是心里总是甜滋滋的。他们豪迈地说：“生为毛主席的革命路线而战斗，死为毛主席的革命路线而献身，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级司令部，这是我们最高的职责！”
    紧密联系群众，才能更加自觉地落实毛主席的无产阶级司令部的每一个指示
    红桥区支左部队在斗争实践中深深体会到，毛主席的最新指示，以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的号令，反映了国内外阶级斗争的客观规律，代表了无产阶级、劳动人民的根本利益。只有结合实际，到群众中，到火热的斗争中去学习，去贯彻，才能真正认识到毛主席的指示的伟大意义，才能更加自觉地落实毛主席的最新指示。
    今年二月中旬，天津市革命委员会根据毛主席发出的建立三结合领导机构的指示，号召掀起一个建立基层革命委员会的高潮。当时，有些同志不够理解，认为实现一片红的条件不够成熟。但是他们认识到这是毛主席发出的伟大指示，是无产阶级司令部的号令，就立即行动起来，满腔热情地投入战斗。他们发动了几千名职工，组成工人毛泽东思想宣传队，到工厂、学校、街道、机关，宣传毛主席的最新指示。毛主席的指示一旦和群众见面，立即产生了巨大的物质力量，全区迅速出现了一个建立基层革委会的大好形势。一天中午，工业五片三小片工人毛泽东思想宣传队，来到经编织物厂宣传毛主席的最新指示，不少工人已经下班了。宣传队的同志立刻分别到工人家里进行宣传。工人们喜出望外，说：“我们早就盼着有这么一天了！”纷纷赶回厂里协商实现革命的三结合的问题。在宣传队的帮助下，当晚十点钟，厂革命委员会胜利诞生了。就这样，全区五百四十多个基层单位迅速建立了革委会，在天津市区第一个实现了全区一片红。
    这件事，给支左人员上了生动的一课，他们深深地认识到，迅速地把基层革委会建立起来，是全面落实毛主席的最新指示，夺取文化大革命全面胜利的迫切需要，是革命形势和阶级斗争形势发展的必然趋势，也是革命群众的强烈愿望。毛主席的最新指示是高瞻远瞩的伟大科学预见，是广大革命群众的根本利益和迫切要求。我们不理解，是因为我们不了解群众的愿望和要求。大家说：“毛主席是革命群众最敬爱的伟大领袖，革命群众最爱毛主席，最听毛主席的话。我们和群众靠得近一分，对毛泽东思想的信仰就深一分，对毛主席最新指示的理解就多一分，执行毛主席最新指示的自觉性就高一分。”
    关键在于有一个无限忠于以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的领导班子
    红桥区支左部队临时党委深深懂得，落实毛主席和毛主席的无产阶级司令部的一系列最新指示，关键在于领导。临时党委组成后的第一件事，就是作出了在执行支左工作中突出无产阶级政治，加强党委革命化建设的决定。两年来，他们把忠于毛主席、忠于毛主席的无产阶级司令部作为支左工作坚定正确的政治方向，作为党委和部队革命化建设的根本，把落实毛主席一系列最新指示作为自己最神圣的职责。
    今年四月，毛主席深刻指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”毛主席这一最新指示发表的当天，临时党委就组织全体支左同志认真学习。大家提高了阶级斗争观念，认清了阶级斗争的新形势，新特点，新动向，迅速投入了清理阶级队伍的战斗。当对敌斗争形成高潮的时候，一小撮阶级敌人以极“左”的面目出现，极力混淆两类不同性质的矛盾，妄图把运动引入歧途。在这关键时刻，临时党委又组织全体支左同志学习毛主席最新指示和严格区分两类不同性质矛盾的教导，从而拨开了迷雾，端正了航向，粉碎了阶级敌人的罪恶阴谋，对敌斗争更加轰轰烈烈地开展起来。最近，在对敌斗争取得重大胜利的情况下，临时党委便组织全体支左同志学习毛主席最新指示和“宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王”的教导，强调对一小撮阶级敌人要在揭深批透上下功夫，使对敌斗争一步步地向纵深发展。支左部队临时党委就是这样，坚持用毛泽东思想武装全体支左人员和广大革命群众的头脑，带领大家沿着毛主席指引的航向前进，完全彻底地、扎扎实实地落实毛主席的一系列最新指示。
    在毛主席《炮打司令部》大字报发表两周年的前夕，驻天津红桥区支左部队和广大革命群众一起，回顾了两年来紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，落实毛主席最新指示的战斗历程。他们深深体会到，无限忠于毛主席就是胜利！认真落实毛主席的无产阶级司令部发布的每一个指示、通令、布告就是胜利！　（北空新）
