Our great leader Chairman Mao's brilliant statement that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" is a universal truth of Marxism-Leninism. Many foreign sailors who have traveled to China have eagerly shared their experiences and insights from studying Chairman Mao's brilliant statement. Their words express the resolve and confidence of the oppressed peoples of the world to follow the revolutionary path indicated by Chairman Mao.

"The Gun Barrel Yields Political Power" is an Unshakable Truth

Many Indonesian sailors have deeply felt, from their own revolutionary struggles, that brilliant Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought are the most powerful weapons for defeating the enemy. Upon arriving in China, one elderly Indonesian sailor excitedly told his Chinese comrades that the revolutionary people of Indonesia, under the leadership of the Indonesian Communist Party, are currently taking up arms to wage guerrilla warfare and strike against the enemy, achieving continuous victories. He excitedly said, "Chairman Mao Zedong is the greatest teacher of the revolutionary people of the world. His brilliant thoughts are the beacon of revolutionary victory and the most powerful weapon for defeating the enemy. Every victory in the Indonesian people's revolutionary struggle is a victory of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought combined with Indonesian revolutionary practice." He also deeply felt that "revolutionaries cannot for a moment deviate from Mao Zedong Thought, otherwise the revolution will fail and the people will suffer. Only the path of armed struggle is the correct revolutionary path." Another Indonesian sailor mentioned that from the bloody lessons of the Indonesian revolutionary struggle, he even more firmly recognized that Chairman Mao's brilliant teaching that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" is an unshakable truth. He condemned that the so-called "peaceful transition to socialism" is merely deceitful talk. He expressed his resolve to follow Chairman Mao's path of armed struggle and thoroughly defeat the Indonesian reactionaries.

Pick Up the Gun and Make Revolution

On a British ocean liner, a black man named Anthony worked as a radio operator. He suffered savage persecution from racists. When the ship docked at a certain port, the captain suddenly ordered him off the ship. Knowing that the ship was heading to the longed-for New China, he strongly requested to disembark in China. After a fierce struggle, the captain was forced to agree.

Already unemployed, Anthony stood on the ship, day and night gazing at the boundless ocean. He yearned to reach Mao Zedong's New China! After the ship docked in a Chinese port, he saw Chinese staff and, with boundless enthusiasm, poured out the sufferings of his people and his own bitter history of exploitation and oppression since childhood, as well as his recent unemployment. His eyes flashed with anger, and he tightly clutched his chest, saying in anguish, "They kicked me off because I am black, because I am black!"

In New China, Anthony studied Chairman Mao's brilliant teachings: "The evil system of colonialism and imperialism, which is based on the enslavement and trafficking of black people, will necessarily come to an end with the complete liberation of the black race." Anthony was deeply moved and said, "Chairman Mao's words are so true! Chairman Mao cares the most for us blacks, understands us the most, Chairman Mao is our great savior!"

A few days later, Anthony was about to return to his homeland in Latin America. With tears in his eyes, he bid farewell to the Chinese staff, saying, "Thank you, thank you Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao taught us that 'political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.' When I go back, I will definitely tell my friends this truth, pick up the gun and make revolution, follow Mao Zedong's path." As he parted, he took out a photo of himself and gave it to the Chinese staff, writing on the back with great emotion:

"With my best wishes, long live Chairman Mao!"

Do Not Hand Over the Gun to the Enemy

At midnight, a young Greek sailor took out a photo of his uncle from his cabin and showed it to his Chinese friends. This was a photo of an old guerrilla fighter who was over sixty years old and had fought bravely against the Fascist army during World War II. In a battle that was about to be won, an order suddenly came down to lay down their weapons and withdraw from the fight. The next day, they were surrounded by the Fascist army, and many guerrillas were massacred on the beach. At that time, his uncle was also wounded and lay unconscious in a pool of blood. Fortunately, he was rescued by coastal residents.

Recently, this old warrior received a copy of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" from his nephew and began studying revolutionary truths. He wrote to his nephew saying that as he studied the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," especially Chairman Mao's brilliant statement that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun," he recalled the past struggles. It was Chairman Mao's teaching that solved the mystery he had buried in his heart for decades. He said: Reading the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," I finally understood that in that battle, the decision to withdraw from the fight was because at that time, revisionism and traitors had appeared within the Greek Communist Party; they handed over the army and weapons to the reactionaries, while they themselves wanted to become officials through the parliament, thus causing the Greek revolution to fail.

This old guerrilla fighter firmly stated in his letter: The people must gain liberation, and the motherland must win independence, by following the path indicated by Mao Zedong. He instructed his nephew to remember Chairman Mao's words, to pick up the gun, and never to hand over the gun to the enemy.

Determined to Follow Chairman Mao's Teachings and Engage in Armed Struggle

"We look up to Beijing, we listen to Beijing's voice! Beijing is the lighthouse of the world revolution, Mao Zedong is the great helmsman of the world revolutionary ship! Follow Mao Zedong, always make revolution! Follow Mao Zedong, the world will be red!"

This is a song sung from the heart by a Venezuelan sailor. When this sailor received a Spanish edition of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" from Chinese comrades, he was very happy. Excitement, joy, and happiness made him unable to calm down for a long time. He excitedly told the Chinese comrades, "My heart is with Beijing, with the red sun Mao Zedong in the hearts of the world's people! Chairman Mao's books, the more I read, the more I love to read. From the revolutionary red book, I know the truth of 'political power grows out of the barrel of a gun,' I understand that only by engaging in revolutionary armed struggle can the oppressed working people be liberated. I am determined to follow the teachings of Chairman Mao Zedong and engage in armed struggle!" He then told the Chinese comrades that in Venezuela, many young people have already taken up weapons, gone into the mountains, and engaged in revolutionary struggles. He expressed his firm belief that relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, they would definitely drive away American imperialism and achieve national independence and liberation.

Let Mao Zedong Thought Guide Us Forward

One day, while Chinese comrades were performing for Yugoslav sailors, one sailor suddenly stood up excitedly and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!" Immediately, the entire venue echoed with cheers and slogans, expressing the boundless love of the Yugoslav revolutionary people for Chairman Mao.

After the performance, one sailor angrily denounced to the Chinese comrades the heinous crimes of the Tito clique. He said, "In the past, Germany, Italy, and the United States invaded us, but now these invaders have become friends of Yugoslavia; in the past, we used our blood and lives to win the rebirth of our motherland, but now the people live in misery, and many are forced to wander abroad in search of work." At this point, he was extremely angry. Then, he talked about his experience studying Chairman Mao's teachings on "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." He said, "We Yugoslav people know that Mao Zedong is the true leader and teacher of the Yugoslav revolutionary people; only Mao Zedong Thought can save Yugoslavia. I am very happy that this time I can come to China, see your happy life with my own eyes, see your good army and people. When I go back, I will tell the Yugoslav people, encourage them to unite, and follow Mao Zedong's path." At this time, he sincerely requested that the Chinese staff give him more copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and Mao Zedong badges. He talked about the urgent desire of the Yugoslav people to obtain Chairman Mao's precious books. He said, "I will take Chairman Mao's books to the Adriatic coast, spread Mao Zedong Thought to the Yugoslav people." He also said, "We Yugoslav people love Chairman Mao from the heart. I sincerely wish the Chinese people long live! Long live the Communist Party of China! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

　　被压迫人民只有走武装斗争道路才能获得解放
　　外国海员畅谈学习毛主席关于“枪杆子里面出政权”英明论断的体会
    新华社三十一日讯　我们的伟大领袖毛主席关于“枪杆子里面出政权”的英明论断是放之四海而皆准的马克思列宁主义真理。许多远航来到中国的外国海员，怀着无限激动的心情畅谈了他们和他们的朋友学习毛主席这一英明论断的体会。他们的话语，表达了全世界被压迫人民坚决要走毛主席指引的革命道路的决心和信心。
　　“枪杆子里面出政权”是颠扑不破的真理
    许多印度尼西亚海员，从印尼人民革命斗争实践中深刻体会到，光辉灿烂的马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想是战胜敌人的最强大的武器。一位印尼老海员一到中国，就兴奋地告诉中国同志说，印尼革命人民目前正在印尼共产党领导下，拿起武器进行游击战争，打击敌人，不断取得了胜利。他激动地说，毛泽东主席是世界革命人民最伟大的导师，他老人家的光辉思想，是革命胜利的灯塔，是战胜敌人的最强大的武器。印尼人民革命斗争的每一个胜利，都是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想与印尼革命具体实践相结合的胜利。他还深有体会地说：“革命者一时一刻也不能背离毛泽东思想，否则，革命就要失败，人民就要遭殃，只有走武装斗争的道路，才是唯一正确的革命道路。”另一位印尼海员谈到，他从印尼革命斗争的血的教训中更加认识到，毛主席关于“枪杆子里面出政权”的英明教导，是颠扑不破的真理。他谴责说，那些所谓“和平过渡到社会主义”的论调，只不过是骗人的鬼话。他表示坚决走毛主席指引的武装斗争的道路，彻底打败印尼反动派。
    拿起枪杆闹革命
    在一艘英国远洋轮上担任电报员工作的黑人安东尼，遭到了种族主义者的野蛮迫害。他在随船远航到某地港口时，船长突然要把他就地赶下船去。他知道船要到他日夜向往的中国来，就强烈要求到中国后离船。经过激烈的斗争，船长终于被迫同意了他的要求。
    已经失业的安东尼站在船上日夜注视着无边无际的茫茫海洋，他多么盼望早日到达毛泽东的新中国啊！船驶进中国港口后，他见到中国工作人员，就象见到了亲人一样，满怀激情地倾诉了自己祖国人民遭受的苦难，以及自己从小受尽剥削压迫的血泪史和最近失业的经过。他眼睛里喷射着怒火，两手紧抓住自己胸前的衣服悲愤地说：“他们把我赶走就因为我是黑人，是黑人啊！”
    在新中国的土地上，安东尼学习了毛主席英明的教导：“万恶的殖民主义、帝国主义制度是随着奴役和贩卖黑人而兴盛起来的，它也必将随着黑色人种的彻底解放而告终。”安东尼无比激动地说：“毛主席的话，说得太好了，毛主席最关心我们黑人，最了解我们黑人，毛主席是我们黑人的大救星！”
    几天后，安东尼就要回远在拉丁美洲的祖国去了，他含着热泪向中国工作人员告别说：“感谢你们，感谢毛主席。毛主席教导说：‘枪杆子里面出政权’，我回去后，一定把这个真理告诉我的朋友们，拿起枪杆闹革命，走毛泽东的道路。”临别时他掏出一张自己的照片送给中国工作人员，并满怀激情地在照片背面工工整整地写着：
    “带着我最好的愿望祝毛主席万寿无疆！”
    决不能把枪杆子交给敌人
    午夜，一位年轻的希腊海员从自己船舱的房间里拿出一张他伯父的照片给中国朋友看。这是一位已经六十多岁的老游击队员，在第二次世界大战中，曾同法西斯军队英勇地作过战。在一次攻城战斗将要取得胜利的时刻，突然传下命令，要他们放下武器，撤离战斗。第二天，他们就被法西斯军队包围了，许多游击队员在海滩上被血腥屠杀。当时他伯父也中弹受伤，倒在血泊里不省人事。事后，幸亏被海滨居民救了出来。
    最近，这位老战士从侄儿那里得到了一本《毛主席语录》，开始学习革命的真理。他写信告诉他侄儿说，他一边学习《毛主席语录》特别是关于“枪杆子里面出政权”的英明论断，一边回忆以往斗争的岁月。正是毛主席这个教导解开了他几十年来埋在心底的谜。他说：读了《毛主席语录》，我才清楚知道，在那次战斗中，所以作出撤离战斗的决定，是因为那时希腊共产党内出现了修正主义，出现了叛徒；他们把军队和武器白白交给了反动派，而自己想通过议会去做官，这就使希腊的革命遭到了失败。
    这位老游击队员在信中坚定地表示：人民要获得解放，祖国要赢得独立，就必须走毛泽东指引的道路。他嘱咐他侄儿要好好记住毛主席的话，要拿起枪杆子，并且决不能把枪杆子交给敌人。
    决心遵循毛主席的教导，搞武装斗争
    “我们仰望北京，倾听北京的声音！北京是世界革命的灯塔，毛泽东是世界革命航船上的伟大舵手！跟着毛泽东，永远闹革命！跟着毛泽东，世界一片红！”
    这是一位委内瑞拉海员从内心里唱出的颂歌。当这位海员从中国同志那里要到一本西班牙文版的《毛泽东选集》时，非常高兴。兴奋、喜悦和幸福的心情使他久久不能平静。他激动地对中国同志说：“我的心向着北京，向着世界人民心中的红太阳毛主席！毛主席的书，我越读越爱读，我从革命的红宝书里知道了‘枪杆子里面出政权’的道理，懂得了只有搞革命武装斗争，才能使受压迫的劳苦大众得到解放。我决心遵照毛泽东主席的教导，搞武装斗争！”接着他告诉中国同志说，在委内瑞拉已经有许多青年，拿起武器，走进山区，进行革命斗争。他表示坚信：依靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，就一定能够赶走美帝国主义，取得民族独立和解放。
    让毛泽东思想指导我们奋勇前进
    一天，中国同志正在为南斯拉夫海员演出时，当场有一位海员突然激动地振臂高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万万岁！”顿时，全场响起了一片欢呼声、口号声，表达了南斯拉夫革命人民无限热爱毛主席的感情。
    演出结束后，有一位海员以无比愤怒的心情向中国同志控诉了铁托叛徒集团的滔天罪行。他说：“过去德国、意大利、美国侵略我们，现在这些侵略者却成了南斯拉夫的朋友；过去我们用鲜血和生命换来了祖国的新生，现在人民却生活在水深火热之中，很多人被迫流浪到国外去寻找工作。”说到这里，他万分气愤。接着，他谈起学习毛主席“枪杆子里面出政权”的教导的体会。他说：“我们南斯拉夫人民知道，毛泽东是我们南斯拉夫革命人民真正的领袖和导师；只有毛泽东思想才能拯救我们南斯拉夫。我感到非常幸福的是，这次我能到中国来，亲眼看到你们幸福的生活，看到你们这样好的军队和人民。我回去后要告诉南斯拉夫人民，鼓舞他们团结起来，走毛泽东的道路。”这时，他恳切地要求中国工作人员再送给他一些《毛主席语录》和毛主席像章。他谈到了南斯拉夫人民渴望得到毛主席的宝书的迫切心情。他说：“我要把毛主席的书带到亚得里亚海岸，把毛泽东思想传播给南斯拉夫人民。”他还说：“我们南斯拉夫人民从内心热爱毛主席，我衷心地祝愿中国人民万岁！中国共产党万岁！毛泽东主席万岁！万万岁！”
