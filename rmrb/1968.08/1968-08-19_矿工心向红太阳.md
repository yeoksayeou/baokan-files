Dear Editor,

The great leader Chairman Mao recently gave us profound guidance: "Our country has 700 million people. The working class is the leading class. We must fully unleash the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and all other work. The working class must also continuously raise its political consciousness in the struggle." This is the greatest trust, encouragement, support, and education for our working class. Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! The sun is warm, but you are warmer than the sun; parents are dear, but you are dearer than parents! You are the red sun in our hearts, you are our closest confidant!

Following Chairman Mao means victory! We, the working class, understand this great truth best. In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "it is reasonable to rebel against the reactionaries," smashed the bourgeois reactionary line, exposed China's Khrushchev and his agents in our mine, and knocked them down to the ground. We followed Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions, combined with the revolutionary criticism and denunciation, launched a fierce and sustained attack on a handful of class enemies. This greatly boosted the morale of the proletariat and crushed the arrogance of the bourgeoisie. Chairman Mao's great instruction to "grasp revolution, promote production" inspired us to achieve a double harvest in revolution and production. Production levels rose month by month. In June, production levels increased by 16% compared to May. In July, the entire mine achieved "red teams" and "full red," with production levels increasing by 13% compared to June.

The coal sea surges with a thousand waves, miners' hearts turn toward the red sun. We, the coal miners who were once called "stinking black coal workers" by the bourgeoisie and suffered endless oppression and exploitation in the old society, now live a happy life and have become the masters of the state. Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! You are the reddest red sun in our hearts, you are forever in our hearts! We, the miners of the capital, are determined to take Comrade Lin Biao as our shining example, to forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, to forever be loyal to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and to forever be loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We will follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment under the unified command of the proletarian headquarters, unify our thinking, unify our steps, and unify our actions. We will resolutely implement Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions and seize a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Yours sincerely,
Representatives of the Workers of Beijing Mentuogou Coal Mine

    矿工心向红太阳编辑同志：
    伟大领袖毛主席最近深刻地教导我们：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”这是对我们工人阶级的最大信任、最大鼓舞、最大支持、最大教育。毛主席啊，毛主席！太阳暖，您老人家比太阳还要暖；爹娘亲，您老人家比爹娘还要亲！您是我们心中的红太阳，您是我们最亲的贴心人！
    紧跟毛主席就是胜利！我们工人阶级最了解这一伟大的真理。在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，我们遵照毛主席
  “对反动派造反有理”的教导，冲垮了资产阶级反动路线，揪出了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在我矿的代理人，把他们打翻在地。我们又遵照毛主席一系列最新指示，结合开展革命大批判，向
    一小撮阶级敌人发起了猛烈的持久的进攻。大长了无产阶级的志气，大灭了资产阶级的威风。毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大教导，鼓舞我们取得革命和生产双丰收，生产月月上升，六月生产水平比五月提高百分之十六，七月份全矿实现了队队红、满堂红，生产水平比六月份提高百分之十三。
    煤海掀起千层浪，矿工心向红太阳。我们这些在旧社会被资产阶级称作“臭煤黑子”、受尽了压迫和剥削的煤矿工人，如今过着幸福的生活，做了国家的主人。毛主席啊，毛主席！您是我们心中最红最红的红太阳，您永远和我们心连心！我们生活在毛主席身边的首都矿工，决心以林副主席为光辉榜样，永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于战无不胜的毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。在无产阶级司令部的号令下统一认识，统一步伐，统一行动，坚决落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
