In the midst of the triumphant songs of the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, another large-scale water-extraction mine in our country—Kailuan Coal Mine’s Lüjiatun Mine—has recently been completed and put into production. Along with it, a large-scale coal washing plant with an annual processing capacity of three hundred million tons has also been completed. The completion of this mine and coal washing plant is a victory of Mao Zedong Thought and a fruit of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The revolutionary workers who undertook the construction of this mine have implemented the great directive of our great leader Chairman Mao, “Grasp revolution, promote production.” During the construction of the mine, they insisted on prioritizing proletarian politics and used Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything. When encountering flowing sand and rocks while excavating large cross-sections of rock tunnels, the revolutionary workers repeatedly studied the “Three Constantly Read Articles,” carried forward the revolutionary spirit of “making up your mind, not fearing sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory,” overcame the difficulties, and completed the task on time.

    开滦吕家坨矿建成并投入生产
    在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，我国又一座大型水采矿井——开滦煤矿吕家坨矿最近建成并投入生产。和它同时建成的还有一座年处理能力为三百万吨的大型洗煤厂。这座矿井和洗煤厂的建成，是毛泽东思想的胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的成果。
    承担这个矿井建设任务的革命职工，贯彻执行伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，在建井过程中，坚持突出无产阶级政治，用毛泽东思想统帅一切。在开凿大断面岩巷中，遇到了流沙、岩石，革命职工反复学习“老三篇”，发扬“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的革命精神，战胜了困难，按时完成了任务。
