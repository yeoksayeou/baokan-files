To Fully Exert the Leading Role of the Working Class
Mao Zedong Thought Gives Us Endless Strength

Editor:

Recently, a foreign-made bottle-making machine that had been shelved for four years in our factory was installed and put into production by the workers, despite the lack of any technical documentation. Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out in his latest instructions: "The working class is the leading class." In this class struggle within the realm of production, we have witnessed the great leading role of the working class.

The bottle-making machine in our factory was imported from abroad in 1963. However, this five-ton machine, when it arrived at the factory, not only lacked necessary parts but also did not come with any diagrams or instructions, essentially a pile of scrap iron. This was clearly a deliberate attempt by foreigners to hold us back, and the workers were very angry. At that time, they suggested to the factory leadership: "First, let's disassemble the machine to understand its structure and performance, and then we can figure out how to install it." However, the capitalist-roaders and bourgeois technical "authorities" in our factory said, "You can't touch it; it's an imported machine from abroad, and we don't have the technical documentation, so we can't do it." What a pathetic display of servility to foreigners!

The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has exposed those who advocate the capitalist-road line of building the factory, and the workers have taken control of the party, government, finance, and cultural affairs. The factory established a revolutionary committee, and the workers decided to conquer this "foreign tiger" that some people thought was untouchable.

Without documentation, can we not disassemble or install it? No! The Chinese working class has dignity. Those who want to strangle us will never succeed! Those who want to crawl at the feet of foreigners, the workers will never allow it. Several veteran workers formed an installation team. Every day, in front of the portrait of our great leader Chairman Mao, they studied his instructions together: "Human beings must constantly summarize experience, make discoveries, inventions, and creations, and progress." The great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought gave the workers endless strength. They finally dissected this "foreign tiger." The actual situation showed that the "foreign tiger" was just a superficially impressive but internally weak monster. It was a product of crawlingism, with many important parts made from products of various countries, a "mishmash." The workers, after seeing this, despised the "foreign tiger" even more and decided not only to conquer it but also to modify it.

To solve the problem of balanced material for the bottles, the workers wanted to add a material-distributing cylinder to the machine. Some people said, "It didn't come with one when we bought it from abroad; they can use it, why do we need to add one?" The workers said, "We want to work better than they do. We need what they have, and we need what they don't have." The workers brought the technicians to the site and together researched the installation location of the material-distributing cylinder, and installed the device. The machine originally had eight molds, but only one came with the import, and the molds did not match the shapes and forms. Some people said to first "trace" the one mold that came with it and copy it. The workers said, "Whoever wants to crawl can go crawl; we will walk our own path." After the workers carefully studied it, they finally found the key to the molds and improved the installation of the eight molds.

We workers, with the attitude of masters of the country, overcame one difficulty after another, climbed one peak after another, and in just four months, successfully modified this machine. All the workers in the factory joyfully regarded it as a great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

    充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用
    毛泽东思想给了我们无穷的力量编辑同志：
    最近，我们厂一部被搁置了四年之久的进口制瓶机，在没有一切技术资料的情况下，经过工人们的努力，安装投入生产了。伟大领袖毛主席在最新指示中指出：“工人阶级是领导阶级”。在生产领域里的这场阶级斗争中，我们亲眼看到了工人阶级的伟大领导作用。
    我们厂的这部制瓶机是一九六三年从国外进口的。但是这部五吨重的机器进厂时，不仅缺少必要的配件，甚至连图纸说明都没有，等于置了一大堆的废铁。这明明是外国人有意卡我们，工人们非常气愤，当时就向工厂的领导方面提出建议：先把机器拆开来看看，摸到了规律和性能，就有办法把机器安装起来。可是我厂的走资派和资产阶级技术“权威”却说什么“动不得，机器是外国进口的，没有技术资料，我们干不了。”真是一副洋奴相！
    史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，把那些推行反革命修正主义建厂路线的走资派冲刷了出来，工人掌握了党政财文大权，工厂成立了革命委员会，工人们决心要征服这部被某些人认为摸不得的“洋老虎”。
    果真没有资料就拆不得、装不得吗？不！中国工人阶级是有志气的，有人要卡我们的脖子，一万个办不到！有人想在外国人的脚底下爬行，工人们坚决不答应。几个老工人成立了一个安装小组，他们每天在伟大领袖毛主席像前一起学习最高指示：“人类总得不断地总结经验，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进。”伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想给了工人们无穷的力量，他们终于把这只“洋老虎”解剖开了。实际情况表明：“洋老虎”只不过是个外表漂亮、内里虚弱的庞然大物，它本身就是爬行主义的产物，机器中的不少重要部件，是由许多国家产品凑起来的，是一个“大凑合”。工人们看了以后，更加蔑视“洋老虎”，不但要征服它，而且要改装它。
    为了解决瓶子用料的均衡，工人们要在机器上加一个匀料筒，有些人却说：从外国买来的时候就没有，他们能使，我们为什么要加呢？工人们说：我们要比他们工作得更好，他们有的我们要有，他们没有的我们也要有。工人把技术员拉到现场，一同研究匀料筒的安装地点，把匀料筒装置起来了。机器原来有八个模具，进口时只附来一个，而且出型、成型不配套。有人说先把附来的一个模具“测绘”一下，依葫芦画样儿。工人说谁愿意爬谁去爬，我们要走自己的路。经过工人们认真研究，终于找到模具关键的所在，改进了八个模具的安装。
    我们工人就是这样以国家主人翁的态度，克服了一个又一个困难，攀登了一个又一个高峰，仅仅用了四个月的时间，就把这台机器改装成功。全厂广大职工都欢欣鼓舞地把它看成是毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利。
