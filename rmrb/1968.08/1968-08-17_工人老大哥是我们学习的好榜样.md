	Workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the most politically and ideologically advanced in our country. They enthusiastically help us and are closely connected with us poor and lower-middle peasants. They are our elder brothers.

	As soon as the "three summer" period began this year, revolutionary workers from a factory in Pinggu County organized a "support agriculture team" and came to our commune to support the "three summer" work. They studied, worked, and engaged in self-criticism and criticized revisionism with us. During breaks, they propagated Mao Zedong Thought in the fields. In the evenings, they helped us hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes and deeply carried out revolutionary criticism and self-criticism. The workers from the "support agriculture team" also paid attention to addressing immediate thoughts. They found that some members of the leading cadres in two brigades of our commune had the word "fear" in their minds and were hesitant in their work, so they promptly had heart-to-heart talks with these cadres and studied Chairman Mao's great teachings together, helping these cadres quickly get rid of the word "fear" and work actively. The other day, when the drought was severe and watering was needed, a water pump in Liuzhuang Brigade broke down. The "support agriculture team" heard about this and immediately came to help repair it. Although they had never repaired a water pump before, they had a heart fully dedicated to serving the poor and lower-middle peasants. They fought from dawn to midnight, not even having time to eat, and finally overcame one difficulty after another, repairing the water pump. When the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants heard the sound of the water pump and saw the clear water flowing into the fields, they were all deeply moved and said, "The worker elder brothers are truly good servants of the people, serving the people wholeheartedly. They are our good examples to learn from."

	Chairman Mao pointed out in his latest instructions, "The working class is the leading class." In our days and nights of struggle with the workers of the "support agriculture team," we saw the working class's boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and their boundless loyalty to the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. We saw the most advanced and excellent qualities of the working class; their Mao Zedong Thought is learned the best and used the most actively, and they serve the people completely and thoroughly.

	We resolutely follow Chairman Mao's great teachings, humbly learn from the working class, and closely unite with the working class, fight with them, and achieve victory with them. We will form an even more solid alliance between workers and peasants, an alliance that cannot be washed away by floods or blown apart by storms.

    工人老大哥是我们学习的好榜样编辑同志：
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的我国工人阶级，政治思想最红，他们积极热情地帮助我们，和我们贫下中农血肉相连，是我们的老大哥。
    今年“三夏”一开始，平谷县某厂的革命工人就组织了“支农小组”，来到我们公社支援“三夏”。他们和我们一起学习，一起劳动，一起斗私批修，劳动休息时，就在田间地头宣传毛泽东思想。晚上又帮助我们举办毛泽东思想学习班，深入开展革命的大批判。“支农小组”的工人老大哥还注意狠抓活思想。他们发现我们公社有两个大队的领导班子的个别成员思想上有“怕”字，工作缩手缩脚，就及时地找这些干部谈心，和他们共同学习毛主席的伟大教导，使这些干部很快丢掉了“怕”字，积极地工作。前些时候，正当天旱地干需要浇水时，刘店大队有个水泵机突然坏了，“支农小组”知道了这件事，就赶忙来帮助修理。虽然他们过去没有修过水泵机，但是他们有着全心全意为贫下中农服务的一颗红心，从清早一直战斗到深夜，连饭都顾不得吃，终于战胜了一个又一个的困难，把水泵机给修好了。当广大贫下中农听到水泵机的声音，看到清水流向田间的时候，都万分激动地说：“工人老大哥真是全心全意为人民服务的好勤务员，是我们学习的好榜样。”
    毛主席在最新指示中深刻地指出：“工人阶级是领导阶级。”在我们和“支农小组”工人战斗的日日夜夜里，我们看到了工人阶级对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱，对以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部无限忠诚，看到了工人阶级最进步最优秀的崇高品质；他们的毛泽东思想学得最好，用得最活，为人民服务完全彻底。
    我们坚决遵照毛主席的伟大教导，虚心向工人阶级学习，紧紧地和工人阶级团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起，结成更加巩固的工农联盟，洪水冲不垮，狂风吹不散。
