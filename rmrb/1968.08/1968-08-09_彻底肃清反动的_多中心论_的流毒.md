Over the past two years, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's "Bombard the Headquarters" big-character poster and the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," and under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters with Chairman Mao as the commander-in-chief and Vice Chairman Lin as the deputy, have smashed the bourgeois headquarters headed by the Chinese Khrushchev, advancing from victory to new victories. From our revolutionary struggle, we deeply understand that the proletarian headquarters with Chairman Mao as the commander-in-chief and Vice Chairman Lin as the deputy most concentratedly represents the fundamental interests of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses. It is the sole leadership center for the entire Party, the entire army, the entire country, and the broad revolutionary masses.

I am an old sailor who has suffered greatly in the old society and has also enjoyed the sweetness of the new society today. It is precisely because of Chairman Mao's wise leadership that we, the laboring people, have been able to overthrow the three big mountains that weighed us down and achieve complete liberation. The experience of the Chinese revolution over several decades has proven that resolutely following the leadership center headed by Chairman Mao leads to victory after victory in the revolution, while deviating from Chairman Mao's leadership leads to setbacks and even failure in the revolution. The more than two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have further proven that this is an unshakable truth: whenever we strictly follow the orders of the proletarian headquarters with Chairman Mao as the commander-in-chief and Vice Chairman Lin as the deputy, things go smoothly and great achievements are made; whenever we deviate even slightly from the instructions of this leadership center, failing to do what should be done and not prohibiting what should be prohibited, we encounter difficulties and go further and further astray. Therefore, some comrades have deeply felt that: "Following the instructions of the proletarian headquarters leads to victory, not following leads to mistakes, and opposing leads to collapse."

"The tiger crouches and the dragon coils, today's victory surpasses the past, the world is upside down and the times are heroic." Currently, the situation in various places in our country is excellent and getting better and better. However, as Chairman Mao has pointed out long ago: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not readily accept their defeat; they will make their last struggles." The so-called "multi-center theory" disrupts Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and obstructs the implementation of the proletarian revolutionary line. Our revolutionary ranks have been influenced by the reactionary bourgeois "multi-center theory," leading to the spread of anarchism, failure to execute the orders of the proletarian headquarters, infatuation with one's own small hill, clinging tightly to the interests of small groups, and advocating "me as the center." This "multi-center theory," regardless of how beautiful the excuses or how good the facade, is nothing but a revisionist commodity against Mao Zedong Thought. If it is not immediately and thoroughly corrected, it will inevitably slide into the bourgeois quagmire of opposing the proletarian headquarters.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, by following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, we have seized the party, government, financial, and cultural powers from the hands of a handful of capitalist roaders, establishing revolutionary committees. This is a major achievement in resolutely executing the great orders of the proletarian headquarters. However, to further consolidate and develop the revolutionary committees, in addition to directing the struggle firmly at a handful of class enemies, we must also continuously fight against various reactionary currents reflected within the revolutionary ranks. After the establishment of our bureau's revolutionary committee, we conducted a rectification campaign in conjunction with the class struggle situation. We used Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions as our weapon, mobilized the masses, and launched a criticism of various reactionary bourgeois currents such as mountainism, individualism, and small-groupism. Through the criticism, we exposed the enemies' plot to sow discord within the revolutionary ranks, educated the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses, and strengthened the unity within the revolutionary ranks based on Mao Zedong Thought.

Revolutionary struggle practice has made us deeply realize that only by closely uniting around the leadership center of the proletarian headquarters with Chairman Mao as the commander-in-chief and Vice Chairman Lin as the deputy, and resolutely implementing the various instructions of this leadership center, can we build the revolutionary committee into a battle command post that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao. We are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, strengthen the proletarian sense of unity, strengthen revolutionary organizational discipline, and resolutely carry out every instruction of the proletarian headquarters with Chairman Mao as the commander-in-chief and Vice Chairman Lin as the deputy. We will thoroughly execute them and achieve new successes in the great struggle to win a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Follow Chairman Mao, thoroughly make the revolution, follow Chairman Mao, the world will be red.

　　彻底肃清反动的“多中心论”的流毒
　　山东小清河航运局革委会副主任、老船工　郭丕华
    两年来，全国无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众在毛主席《炮打司令部》大字报和《中国共产党中央委员会关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》的指引下，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的领导下，粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，从胜利走向新的胜利。我们从革命斗争的实践中深深懂得：以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，最集中地代表了无产阶级和广大革命群众的根本利益，是全党、全军、全国和广大革命群众唯一的领导中心。
    我是一个老船工，饱受过旧社会的苦，也更享受到今日新社会的甜。正是因为有了毛主席的英明领导，我们劳动人民才能够推翻压在身上的三座大山，获得彻底翻身解放。中国革命几十年的经验都证明：坚决紧跟以毛主席为首的领导中心，革命就节节胜利，离开毛主席的领导，革命就要受到挫折，甚至失败。两年多来的无产阶级文化大革命，更加证明了这是一条颠扑不破的真理：什么时候不折不扣地执行以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的号令，事情就好办，取得的成绩就大；什么时候稍一离开这个领导中心的指示，该做的不做，该禁的不禁，就困难重重，越走越远。因此，有些同志深有体会地说：“对无产阶级司令部的指示，紧跟就胜利，不跟就犯错误，对抗就垮台。”
      “虎踞龙盘今胜昔，天翻地覆慨而慷。”当前我国各地形势一片大好，而且越来越好。但是，也正象毛主席早就指出的：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”所谓“多中心论”，干扰毛主席的伟大战略部署，妨碍无产阶级革命路线的贯彻执行。我们革命队伍内部受了反动的资产阶级的“多中心论”的影响，无政府主义泛滥，不执行无产阶级司令部的号令，迷恋自己的小山头，紧紧抱住小团体的利益不放，搞什么“以我为中心”。这种“多中心论”，不管加上多么美妙的遁词，装上多么好看的门面，都不过是反毛泽东思想的修正主义货色，如不立即彻底纠正，势必滑到对抗无产阶级司令部的资产阶级泥坑中去。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，从一小撮走资派手中夺回了被他们窃取的党、政、财、文大权，建立起革命委员会，这是坚决执行无产阶级司令部伟大号令的重大成果。但是，要进一步巩固和发展革命委员会，除了把斗争矛头紧紧对准一小撮阶级敌人外，还要不断地对反映在革命队伍内部的各种反动思潮进行斗争。我们航运局革委会成立后，结合阶级斗争形势进行了整风。我们以毛主席一系列最新指示为武器，放手发动群众，对于山头主义、个人主义、小团体主义等形形色色的反动的资产阶级思潮，展开了批判。通过批判，揭露了阶级敌人妄图离间革命队伍的阴谋，教育了无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，增强了革命队伍内部在毛泽东思想基础上的团结。
    革命斗争实践，使我们深深认识到，只有紧紧团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部这个领导中心的周围，坚决贯彻执行这个领导中心的各项指示，才能把革委会建设成为无限忠于毛主席的战斗指挥部。我们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，加强无产阶级的整体观念，加强革命的组织纪律性，对以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的每一个指示坚决照办，彻底执行，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大斗争中立新功。紧跟毛主席，彻底闹革命，紧跟毛主席，世界一片红。
