Hundreds of millions of military and civilians warmly celebrate the issuance of Chairman Mao's latest directive and the establishment of the Yunnan Provincial Revolutionary Committee. Chairman Mao's latest directive greatly boosts the morale of the proletariat.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated the 15th, our most beloved and great leader, Chairman Mao, recently pointed out: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully unleash the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all other work. The working class should also continuously raise its political consciousness in the struggle."

The working class of our country, which has played a leading role in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, along with revolutionary cadres, revolutionary masses, and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army from all over the country, warmly celebrate the issuance of Chairman Mao's latest directive while celebrating the establishment of the Yunnan Provincial Revolutionary Committee. They say: Chairman Mao's directive greatly boosts the morale of the proletariat and strikes a heavy blow to the bourgeoisie. It is the fundamental guarantee for carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end and a long-term strategy for preventing revisionism and ensuring that our proletarian iron mountain will never change color. Chairman Mao's directive, issued at this crucial moment of seizing the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution, has extremely important significance. We must deeply understand, earnestly implement, and resolutely carry it out.

Revolutionary masses from all over the country have expressed that they will more closely unite around the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, under the leadership of the working class, strengthen the unity of the revolutionary people, strengthen the proletarian collective consciousness and revolutionary organizational discipline, use Mao Zedong Thought to unify understanding, unify steps, and unify actions, thoroughly criticize the reactionary bourgeois "multi-center theory," and resolutely smash the desperate struggles of a handful of class enemies to seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Wherever Chairman Mao's latest directive reaches, there is a surge of joy. The shouts of "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!" and "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!" echo across the vast land of our motherland. Revolutionary workers and masses in major cities, factories, mines, ports, railways, and transportation units across the country are jubilant. Some beat drums and set off firecrackers, parade through the streets, while others immediately hold study sessions, discussions, and rally meetings to warmly celebrate the issuance of Chairman Mao's latest directive.

In the capital, batches of revolutionary workers carry portraits of Chairman Mao and hold red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to express their loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao. The workers and peasants Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams from the capital, who are propagating Chairman Mao's series of latest directives in colleges and universities, along with many revolutionary workers from factories and enterprises, study Chairman Mao's latest directive overnight and immediately launch extensive propaganda activities. In major cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Xi'an, and Chongqing, workers and revolutionary masses parade and hold meetings all day, launching a wave of studying, propagating, and implementing Chairman Mao's latest directive. In some places, tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of people gather for celebration meetings. Revolutionary masses, revolutionary students, and revolutionary Red Guards from many places express their warm congratulations to the working class. In many cities, large and eye-catching slogans are posted on the streets: "Learn from the working class!" "Salute to the working class!"

Revolutionary workers from all over the country are greatly inspired by Chairman Mao's latest directive, adding boundless strength. They enthusiastically shout: Chairman Mao's latest directive is the greatest trust, the greatest education, the greatest inspiration, and the greatest encouragement for us, the working class! We will not disappoint the great leader Chairman Mao's expectations and will definitely continuously raise our political consciousness in the struggle, better shoulder the historical responsibility of the leading class, and carry the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Revolutionary workers at the Beijing Knitting Factory say that Chairman Mao's latest directive sets higher requirements and greater hopes for us, the working class. We must study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, be the vanguard in propagating Mao Zedong Thought, be the model in implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and be the exemplar in implementing Chairman Mao's series of latest directives. In the Cultural Revolution and all other work, we must fully play a leading role. Many revolutionary workers and engineering and technical personnel of working-class origin from the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory say that they will read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's directives for life. They will always put proletarian politics first, strive to transform their worldview with Mao Zedong Thought, and do a better job in all aspects. Revolutionary workers from the Guiyang Cotton Mill, which was the first in the country to implement revolutionary unity by administrative departments, say that we, the working class, bear the responsibility of the leading class of the state. We must, while transforming the objective world, also transform our subjective world, continuously raise our class consciousness and awareness of the two-line struggle.

Revolutionary workers from the steel city of Anshan say that we, the working class, must continuously raise our consciousness of being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Hundreds of thousands of coal miners in Datong, after hearing Chairman Mao's latest directive, express their loyalty to Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao's latest directive reaches the recently established revolutionary committee of the Nanning Railway Bureau, greatly inspiring the revolutionary workers. They say that they will definitely seize the revolution and promote production, ensure the smooth transportation of aid to Vietnam and anti-American materials, and seize the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution.

Ten years ago, our great leader Chairman Mao personally wrote the brilliant inscription "The lowly are the wisest! The noble are the most foolish!" for a self-reliant factory in our country. The revolutionary workers of this factory, after hearing Chairman Mao's latest directive, repeatedly shout excitedly: Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years! They say that they will forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, continuously raise their political consciousness in the great storms of class struggle, and make greater contributions to the socialist revolution and socialist construction of our country.

Many places where members of the workers and peasants Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams are stationed, after hearing Chairman Mao's latest directive, are even more spirited and full of fighting spirit. Members of the workers and peasants Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team from the capital, who are propagating Chairman Mao's series of latest directives at Tsinghua University, study Chairman Mao's latest directive overnight. They say that they will take "Criticize revisionism and repudiate self" as the key link, continuously raise their political consciousness in the struggle, and build their team into a highly revolutionary and highly combat-ready team that is infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao. An old worker from the Tianjin Second Cotton Mill, who is part of the workers and peasants Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team, says that Chairman Mao's latest directive is the guiding light for our working class to advance. We must tightly unite the revolutionary masses around Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters, form a fighting whole, and bravely fight to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Only the working class has the farthest vision, is the most selfless, and is the most thorough in revolution. The entire history of revolution proves that without the leadership of the working class, the revolution will fail, and with the leadership of the working class, the revolution will succeed." Revolutionary committee members from many places review Chairman Mao's teachings, earnestly study Chairman Mao's latest directive, and immediately take measures to resolutely implement it. Some provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions' revolutionary committees specially convene standing committee meetings and various meetings to deploy the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest directive, deciding to further arm the working class with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, strengthen the work among the working masses, consolidate and develop the revolutionary great unity of the working class by system and industry, and resolutely support all revolutionary actions and pioneering spirits of the working class. In factories, mines, railways, transportation departments, forest areas, and other units across the country, People's Liberation Army soldiers executing the "three supports and two militaries" tasks today all go deep into workshops, mines, stations, docks, work sheds, and workers' dormitories to study Chairman Mao's latest directive with the broad masses of workers. The soldiers say that they will bring the good thoughts, good style, and good experiences of the working class back to the army, further promote the ideological revolutionization of the army, and at the same time use Mao Zedong Thought to arm the working class, so that the working class can play a more comprehensive leading role in all aspects.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary cadres, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary Red Guards all express that they will quickly implement Chairman Mao's latest directive into action. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Hongqidui Brigade, Hongshan Commune, Qiongshan County, Guangdong Province, which Chairman Mao personally recommended in the book "The Socialist High Tide in China's Countryside," say that we, the poor and lower-middle peasants, will definitely accept the leadership of the working class, strengthen the worker-peasant alliance, unite around the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, strengthen the proletarian dictatorship, resolutely smash the reactionary bourgeois "multi-center theory" that splits the revolutionary ranks, and seize the double victory of revolution and production. Members of the Mao Zedong Thought study class of the Red Guards' Revolutionary Committee of colleges and universities in Shaanxi Province excitedly say at a discussion meeting that Chairman Mao has issued this extremely important directive, and we, the Red Guards, will definitely carry it out.

Today, revolutionary committees from various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have sent congratulatory telegrams to the Yunnan Provincial and Kunming Municipal Revolutionary Committees. The broad masses of soldiers and civilians from all over the country excitedly point out that the establishment of a new proletarian revolutionary regime on the southwestern border of our motherland is a heavy blow to imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, reactionaries of all countries, and the Kuomintang bandits, and a great encouragement to the revolutionary people of the entire country. We must closely follow the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, continue to advance, and seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!
