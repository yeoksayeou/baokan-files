Some Pakistani friends have made statements to congratulate the Chinese People's Liberation Army on its 41st anniversary and to enthusiastically acclaim the great victories of Chairman Mao's military thought and the brilliant achievements of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

The Secretary-General of the Pakistan Press Workers Union, Minhaj Barna, told a reporter from Xinhua News Agency that the Chinese People's Liberation Army, personally founded by Chairman Mao, has withstood all storms since its establishment 41 years ago and has defeated the Japanese invaders, American imperialism, and its lackey, the Chiang Kai-shek clique, with inferior equipment. These victories were achieved because the Chinese People's Liberation Army is a genuine people's army armed with Chairman Mao's great military thought.

He pointed out that the greatness of the Chinese People's Liberation Army lies in its ideological armament. It is armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought and is loyal to the cause of the people.

He said that with Chairman Mao's military thought as guidance and the example of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the oppressed peoples of the world who take the path of armed revolution will certainly defeat their common enemy, American imperialism and its accomplices, modern revisionism of the Soviet Union, and their lackeys and puppets.

The Chairman of the Pakistan-China Friendship Association in Sylhet, East Pakistan, Jashimuddin Ahmed, said in a speech at a meeting that trusting and relying on the strength of the people is an important feature of Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao pointed out: "The people, only the people, are the motive force in the creation of world history." Now, from Latin America to the African continent, and even to the fighting Vietnam, there are songs of the people's victory everywhere. The victory of the people is an irresistible historical trend.

Xinhua News Agency, Rawalpindi, August 3rd: Pakistani public opinion has enthusiastically acclaimed the visit of Pakistani Foreign Minister A. H. S. Bhutto to China, celebrating the development of friendship between the two countries.

A recent editorial in the Karachi Dawn said: "As A. H. S. Bhutto recently said in the National Assembly, friendship with China is a fundamental principle of Pakistan's foreign policy. China has consistently and resolutely supported Pakistan's just position on the Kashmir issue. The Pakistani people will forever remember China's support during India's aggression in September 1965; China's continued material and technical assistance to us has been invaluable in strengthening our national defense and economy."

The editorial said: "There are broad areas of understanding and cooperation between China and Pakistan, and more importantly, our two peoples clearly demand further promotion and strengthening of this friendly connection."

The editorial of the Morning News said: "During the foreign minister's visit to Beijing, the friendly and mutually satisfying relations between Pakistan and its great neighbor China will undoubtedly be further strengthened."

The newspaper said that the relations between China and Pakistan "are based on mutual trust, frankness, and sincerity, and have withstood the test of time and tribulations."

The editorial of the Daily News said: "China has always fully supported Pakistan's just position on the Kashmir issue. During the 1965 Indian aggression against Pakistan, China provided us with valuable support, which the Pakistani people will never forget." The editorial believes that Foreign Minister A. H. S. Bhutto's visit to China will undoubtedly help to further develop friendly relations between the two countries.

　　巴基斯坦朋友祝贺我建军四十一周年
　　人民解放军是毛泽东思想武装的军队
　　巴基斯坦舆论就巴外长访华热情欢呼巴中友谊的发展
    新华社达卡二日电　一些巴基斯坦朋友发表谈话，祝贺中国人民解放军建军四十一周年，热烈欢呼毛主席的军事思想的伟大胜利和中国人民解放军的辉煌成就。
    巴基斯坦新闻工作者联合会秘书长明哈杰·巴尔纳对新华社记者说，由毛主席亲自缔造的中国人民解放军从四十一年前建军以来，经受了一切风暴，以劣势的装备打败了日本侵略者、美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石集团。这些胜利之所以取得，是因为中国人民解放军是用毛主席的伟大的军事思想武装起来的真正的人民军队。
    他指出，中国人民解放军的伟大在于它的思想武装。它是用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的，它忠于人民事业。
    他说，有毛主席军事思想作指导，以中国人民解放军的榜样，走上武装革命道路的世界各国被压迫人民，一定会打败他们的共同敌人美帝国主义及其帮凶苏联现代修正主义，以及它们的走狗和傀儡。
    东巴基斯坦锡尔赫特的巴基斯坦—中国友好协会主席贾西穆丁·艾哈迈德在一次集会上讲话说，信任和依靠人民群众的力量，是毛泽东思想的重要特点。毛主席指出：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”现在，从拉丁美洲到非洲大陆，以至到战斗的越南，到处都是人民胜利的歌声。人民的胜利是不可抗拒的历史潮流。
    新华社拉瓦尔品第三日电　巴基斯坦舆论就巴基斯坦外交部长阿沙德·侯赛因访问中国，热烈欢呼巴中两国友谊的发展。
    卡拉奇《黎明报》最近发表的社论：“正如阿沙德·侯赛因最近在国民议会所说的，同中国友好，是巴基斯坦外交政策的基本原则。……中国一贯坚决地支持巴基斯坦在查谟和克什米尔问题上的正义立场。巴基斯坦人民将永远牢记中国在印度于一九六五年九月发动进攻时给我们的支持；中国继续给我们的物质技术支援，对加强我们的国防和国民经济，是宝贵的帮助。”
    社论说：“中巴两国之间有着广泛的谅解与合作的领域，更重要的是，我们两国人民明确地要求进一步增进和加强这种友好联系。”
    《晨报》的社论说：“外交部长访问北京时，巴基斯坦同它的伟大邻邦中国的友好的相互满意的联系，无疑将得到进一步的加强。”
    这家报纸说，中巴两国关系“是建立在相互信任、坦率和真诚的基础上的，经受过时间和患难的考验。”
    《每日新闻》的社论说：“中国始终完全支持巴基斯坦在克什米尔问题上的正义立场。在一九六五年印度侵略巴基斯坦期间，中国给了我们宝贵的支持，巴基斯坦人民是永远不会忘记的。”社论认为，外交部长阿沙德·侯赛因对中国的访问，无疑将有助于进一步发展两国的友好关系。
