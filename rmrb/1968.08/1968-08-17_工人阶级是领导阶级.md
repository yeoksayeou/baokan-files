We are filled with boundless excitement and infinite joy as we enthusiastically hail the issuance of Chairman Mao's latest directive. Everyone is studying it over and over again, discussing and deliberating, and the more we study, the deeper our understanding becomes, and the clearer our minds become. Our great leader, Chairman Mao, points out: "The working class is the leading class." The great struggle of the Cultural Revolution over the past two years and more has further proven that the working class loves Chairman Mao the most, reads Chairman Mao's books the most, listens to Chairman Mao's words the most, and most resolutely executes Chairman Mao's directives. The great working class is the main force of the Cultural Revolution, as well as the main force of the educational revolution and all other work. Wherever the leading role of the working class is fully played and the situation is truly controlled by the working class, Chairman Mao's series of latest directives and the battle cries of the proletarian headquarters will be fully implemented and thoroughly executed, and a great revolutionary situation will emerge; otherwise, there will be various disturbances, and Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment will be disturbed and deviated from. We have a deep understanding of this. For a period of time, in some units where we were supporting the left, the Cultural Revolution movement was temporarily dominated by some intellectuals whose worldviews had not been transformed. They promoted "self-centeredness," and as a result, they were exploited by class enemies, and "internal wars" lasted for a long time, disrupting Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. Later, these units were taken over by the working class, which played a leading role, and under the guidance of Chairman Mao's series of latest directives, quickly achieved revolutionary unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, deeply carried out the revolutionary criticism and class cleansing work, and exposed a handful of hidden traitors, spies, counter-revolutionaries, and unrepentant capitalist roaders. The revolutionary situation is getting better and better. Practice has made us deeply realize that: "The entire history of the revolution proves that without the leadership of the working class, the revolution will fail, and with the leadership of the working class, the revolution will be victorious."

We are determined to forever follow our great leader, Chairman Mao, to eliminate the poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, to further criticize mountainism, individualism, sectarianism, and other bourgeois reactionary worldviews, to fully play the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work, and to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution!

    工人阶级是领导阶级编辑同志：
    我们以无比激动、无限喜悦的心情热烈欢呼毛主席最新指示的发表。大家一遍又一遍地学习，座谈讨论，越学体会越深刻，越学心里越亮堂。伟大领袖毛主席指出：“工人阶级是领导阶级。”两年多来无产阶级文化大革命的伟大斗争实践，进一步证明：工人阶级最热爱毛主席，最爱读毛主席的书，最听毛主席的话，最坚决执行毛主席的指示。伟大的工人阶级是无产阶级文化大革命的主力军，也是无产阶级教育革命和其他一切工作的主力军。凡是充分发挥了工人阶级的领导作用，真正由工人阶级左右了局势的地区和单位，毛主席的一系列最新指示和无产阶级司令部的战斗号令，就会真正得到全面落实和彻底执行，就会出现一片大好革命形势；反之，就会受到种种干扰，就会干扰和背离毛主席的伟大战略部署，这一点我们是有深刻体会的。曾经有一段时间，在我们支左的某些单位的文化大革命运动，一时被一些世界观没有改造好的知识分子所左右，他们大搞“以我为核心”，结果被阶级敌人所利用，“内战”长期不停，干扰了毛主席的伟大战略部署。以后这些单位由工人阶级起来左右了局势，发挥了领导作用，在毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，很快就实现了革命大联合和革命的三结合，深入开展革命大批判和清理阶级队伍工作，揪出了一小撮隐藏的叛徒、特务、反革命分子和死不改悔的走资派，革命形势越来越好。实践使我们深刻认识到：“整个革命历史证明，没有工人阶级的领导，革命就要失败，有了工人阶级的领导，革命就胜利了。”
    我们决心永远紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，肃清中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义路线的流毒，进一步批判山头主义、个人主义、宗派主义等资产阶级反动世界观，充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
