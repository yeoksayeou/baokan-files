Pakistani Foreign Minister Hosts Farewell Banquet
Vice Premier Chen Yi Attends; Host and Guests Toast to Strengthening Sino-Pakistani Friendship
Pakistani Foreign Minister Visits Huangtu Gang People's Commune, Warmly Welcomed by Commune Members

BEIJING, Aug. 6 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister Agha Mohammad Shah and his wife hosted a farewell banquet in Beijing tonight.

Shah and Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi spoke at the banquet, which was filled with a friendly atmosphere. They toasted to the strengthening of friendship between the peoples of Pakistan and China. Chen Yi emphasized in his speech that the Chinese government and people will, as always, firmly support the Pakistani people's struggle to maintain national independence and oppose foreign aggression and interference. This is our principle and it is unchangeable.

Leaders from relevant departments of the Chinese government, the People's Liberation Army, and the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, including Wen Yucheng, Han Nianlong, Xie Huai, Jia Shi, and Zhou Rongguo, were also invited to the banquet.

Shah spoke first. He said that the warm reception and enthusiastic welcome from the Chinese government and people deeply touched us. We were honored to be received by Chairman Mao. The memories of this visit to China, especially the meeting with Chairman Mao, will be our most precious impressions.

He said that this visit to your great country and the talks we held in a spirit of cordiality, sincerity, and complete understanding have been an inspiring and unforgettable experience for me. Our talks have been very beneficial.

Shah expressed heartfelt thanks to the Chinese government and people for the aid provided to Pakistan. He said that economic aid from China has played a beneficial role in Pakistan's economic development. In recent years, the scope of cooperation between our two countries has been expanding. Therefore, the prospects for the future are greater than the achievements of the past.

He said that friendly relations exist pleasantly between China and Pakistan, and both sides hope to live in friendship and engage in constructive cooperation for mutual benefit. The future of Sino-Pakistani friendship is built on a solid foundation, and the development of this friendship is beneficial to China, Pakistan, and peace and stability in this region. He thanked the Chinese government for reaffirming its firm support for the just struggle of the people of Jammu and Kashmir.

Shah said that after witnessing some of the great scenes of the Chinese people's high spirits and learning from your leaders about the great efforts being made nationwide under the guidance of your great and wise leader, Chairman Mao Zedong, we will leave your country with a strong impression that you will not only achieve your future goals but also surpass your past achievements.

Chen Yi then spoke. He said that during his stay in Beijing, Shah received an audience with the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao. Premier Zhou Enlai also had a cordial talk with Shah. We have exchanged views on the international situation in multiple talks and reached a consensus on further strengthening friendly cooperation between the two countries. This is a sincere talk between true friends, reflecting our full understanding and trust. Shah's visit has made new contributions to further consolidating and strengthening the friendly cooperative relationship between China and Pakistan.

Chen Yi said that Shah and other guests have visited and toured Beijing in the past few days, personally witnessing the Chinese people's high spirits in achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao. Through this magnificent, great, and revolutionary mass movement, the fundamental problem of how to prevent capitalist restoration under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship has been solved. This is Chairman Mao's great development of Marxism-Leninism. Although at the beginning, this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution could not be understood by many people internationally, today, two years later, not only our friends have a better understanding of it, but even our enemies have to admit its great significance. Our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will ensure that socialist China will never change color and will promote the all-around and rapid development of our socialist construction, thus enabling us to better support the just struggle of all oppressed peoples and nations against imperialism and modern revisionism worldwide. Pakistani friends can be assured that the seven hundred million Chinese people, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will always be reliable friends of the Pakistani people.

He said that China and Pakistan have common interests in the struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism. We both strictly adhere to the principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality, mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. On this basis, the Sino-Pakistani friendship is solid and has a broad prospect for development.

Chen Yi concluded by saying that we hope Shah will convey the friendly sentiments of the Chinese people to the Pakistani people and extend our cordial greetings to President Ayub Khan.

Pakistani Ambassador to China Sultan Muhammad Khan and other Pakistani friends accompanying Shah also attended the banquet.

BEIJING, Aug. 6 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister Agha Mohammad Shah said during his visit to the Huangtu Gang People's Commune in the Beijing suburbs that we have personally seen the great achievements of the Chinese people. Your achievements are made under the leadership of Chairman Mao and are the result of the guidance of the great leader Mao Zedong's thought.

Shah and his wife, along with other accompanying personnel, visited the Huangtu Gang People's Commune, escorted by Vice Foreign Minister Han Nianlong. They were warmly welcomed by the commune members. Here, the Pakistani guests visited vegetable fields and orchards and listened to the commune Revolutionary Committee's responsible person introduce how poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres study Chairman Mao's works earnestly, strive hard, and transform the barren Huangtu Gang into fertile fields and orchards. The Pakistani guests warmly praised the commune members' achievements. Shah talked about the warm welcome they received here, saying that this demonstrates the deep friendship between the Chinese people and the Pakistani people.

Pakistani Ambassador to China Sultan Muhammad Khan also accompanied the visit.

Shah's wife and other accompanying personnel have also visited the Beijing Arts and Crafts Factory and the Beijing Third Textile Mill in recent days and toured the Summer Palace.

    新华社六日讯　巴基斯坦外交部长阿沙德·侯赛因和夫人，今天晚上在北京举行告别宴会。
    侯赛因部长和国务院副总理兼外交部长陈毅，在充满友好气氛的宴会上先后讲话，共祝巴中两国人民的友谊不断加强。陈毅副总理在讲话中强调说，中国政府和中国人民坚决遵循我们伟大领袖毛主席的革命外交路线，将一如既往地坚决支持巴基斯坦人民维护民族独立和反对外来侵略、干涉的正义斗争。这是我们的原则立场，是不可改变的。
    我国政府有关部门、中国人民解放军和北京市革命委员会的负责人温玉成、韩念龙、谢怀德、贾石、周荣国等，也应邀出席了宴会。
    侯赛因部长首先讲话。他说，中国政府和中国人民的殷勤接待和热情欢迎，使我们深为感动。我们荣幸地受到了毛主席的接见。我们这次访问中国的记忆，特别是我们同毛主席会见的记忆，将是我们最宝贵的印象。
    他说，这次对你们伟大国家的访问以及我们本着亲切、真挚和完全谅解的精神举行的会谈，对我来说是一次令人鼓舞和难忘的经历。我们的会谈是十分有益的。
    侯赛因部长对中国政府和中国人民向巴基斯坦提供的援助，表示衷心的感谢。他说，来自中国的经济援助对巴基斯坦的经济发展起了有利的作用。这些年来，我们两国之间合作的范围不断扩大。因此，今后的希望比过去的成就更大。
    他说，中国和巴基斯坦之间愉快地存在着诚挚的关系，双方都希望友好地相处，并且为相互的利益进行建设性的合作。中巴友谊的前途是建立在牢固的基础上的，这种友谊的发展，对于中国和巴基斯坦以及这个地区的和平和稳定都有好处。他感谢中国政府重申继续坚定不移地支持查谟和克什米尔人民的正义斗争。
    侯赛因部长说，在我们亲眼看到了中国人民热情高涨的一些伟大景象，并从你们的领导人那里获悉你们全国正准备在你们伟大、英明的领袖毛泽东主席的指引下进行更大的努力之后，我们将带着这样一个强烈的印象离开你们的国家，即你们不仅能够实现你们未来的目标，而且还会超过过去的业绩。
    陈毅副总理接着讲话。他说，侯赛因外长在北京期间，得到了中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席的接见。周恩来总理又同侯赛因外长进行了亲切的会谈。我们双方在多次的会谈中，就国际形势交换了意见，并就进一步加强两国的友好合作关系取得了一致看法。这是真诚相待的朋友之间的会谈，体现出我们之间的充分了解和信任。侯赛因外长的这次访问，对于进一步巩固和加强中巴两国友好合作关系作出了新的贡献。
    陈毅副总理说，侯赛因外长和其他贵宾们这几天在北京进行了参观访问，亲自看到了中国人民正在意气风发地夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。这次史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，是我们伟大的领袖毛主席亲自发动和亲自领导的。经过这样一场轰轰烈烈的、伟大的、革命的群众运动，解决了在无产阶级专政条件下，如何防止资本主义复辟的最根本的问题。这是毛主席对马克思列宁主义的伟大发展。对于这次无产阶级文化大革命，尽管在开始的时候，在国际上还不能为许多人所理解，但是在两年后的今天，不但我们的朋友们更加了解了，就是我们的敌人也不得不承认它的重大意义。我国无产阶级文化大革命必将保证社会主义的中国永远不改变颜色，必将促进我国社会主义建设全面地、迅速地发展，从而能使我们更好地支援全世界一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的正义斗争。巴基斯坦朋友们可以相信，经受了无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的七亿中国人民，将永远是巴基斯坦人民的可靠的朋友。
    他说，中国和巴基斯坦两国在反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争中，有着共同的利益。我们都严格遵守互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处的原则。在这一基础上建立起来的中巴友谊是牢固的，是有着广阔的发展前途的。
    陈毅副总理最后说，我们希望侯赛因外长把中国人民对巴基斯坦人民的友好情谊转达给巴基斯坦人民，并请转致我们对阿尤布·汗总统的亲切问候。
    巴基斯坦驻中国大使苏尔坦·穆·汗，随同阿沙德·侯赛因部长来访的其他巴基斯坦朋友，出席了宴会。
    新华社六日讯　巴基斯坦外交部长阿沙德·侯赛因在参观北京郊区黄土岗人民公社时说，我们这次亲眼看到了中国人民所取得的伟大成就。你们的成就是在毛主席领导下取得的，是伟大领袖毛主席思想指引的结果。
    侯赛因部长和夫人及其他随行人员，日前由外交部副部长韩念龙陪同参观了黄土岗人民公社，受到社员群众的热烈欢迎。在这里，巴基斯坦贵宾参观了菜地和果园，并听取了公社革命委员会负责人介绍贫下中农和革命干部活学活用毛主席著作，艰苦奋斗，改造大自然，把贫瘠的黄土岗子改变成良田和果园的事迹。巴基斯坦贵宾热烈称赞公社社员取得的成就。侯赛因部长谈到他们在这里受到的热烈欢迎时说，这表现了中国人民和巴基斯坦人民之间的深厚友谊。
