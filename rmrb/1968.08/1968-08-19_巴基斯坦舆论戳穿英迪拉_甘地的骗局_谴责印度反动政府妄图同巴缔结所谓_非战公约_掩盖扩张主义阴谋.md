Pakistani public opinion has exposed Indira Gandhi's deception and condemned the Indian reactionary government's attempt to conclude a so-called "non-aggression pact" with Pakistan to cover up its expansionist schemes.

According to a report by the Pakistan United Press on August 16, Pakistani political observers believe that the Indian government's proposal to conclude a so-called "non-aggression pact" with Pakistan is merely a shocking trick to deceive world public opinion and cover up its expansionist schemes.

Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi made this "suggestion" in her speech commemorating India's Independence Day. Pakistani political observers pointed out that the Indian government is building a huge war machine; it is taking an uncompromising stance on issues such as Kashmir and other Indo-Pakistani disputes; it has repeatedly abrogated international agreements. These facts expose the emptiness of the Indian government's "suggestion."

Observers pointed out that the Indian rulers' "suggestion" to conclude a "non-aggression pact" is actually aimed at making Pakistan forget the Kashmir issue, which is a matter of life and death in the struggle of the Kashmiri people for their right to self-determination.

On August 16, a reporter from the Dawn newspaper exposed the Indian reactionary government's deception, saying that any country with even a little experience in dealing with the Indian government knows that the Indian government's declarations and commitments on international issues are often not consistent with the purposes it hopes to achieve under the cover of these declarations and commitments. For example, in 1962, the Indian government, while calling for peaceful negotiations with China on the Sino-Indian border issue, ordered the Indian army to advance and launched an armed attack on the Chinese border defense forces. The latest example of the Indian government's intrigues is that in 1965, it launched a war against Pakistan without a declaration of war.

    巴基斯坦舆论戳穿英迪拉·甘地的骗局
    谴责印度反动政府妄图同巴缔结所谓“非战公约”掩盖扩张主义阴谋
    新华社拉瓦尔品第十七日电　据巴基斯坦联合通讯社十六日报道，巴基斯坦的政治观察家认为，印度政府又一次提出要同巴基斯坦缔结一项所谓“非战公约”，这只不过是用来欺骗世界舆论和掩盖它的扩张主义阴谋的耸人听闻的伎俩。
    印度总理英迪拉·甘地在纪念印度独立日的讲话中提出了这个“建议”。巴基斯坦政治观察家指出，印度政府正在建立庞大的战争机器；它在查谟和克什米尔问题等印巴争端上采取不妥协态度；它一再取消国际协议。这些暴露了印度政府的这个“建议”是空的。
    观察家指出，印度统治者“建议”缔结一项“非战公约”，实际上是要巴基斯坦忘记克什米尔问题，这个问题关系到克什米尔人民争取他们的自决权的生死斗争。
    《黎明报》记者十六日揭露印度反动政府的骗局时说，对于印度政府同邻国打交道这件事只要有一点经验的国家都知道，印度政府关于国际问题的宣言和承担义务的表示，和它在这些宣言和表示的掩盖下所希望达到的目的，常常不是一致的。例如，在一九六二年，印度政府一面叫嚷要同中国就中印边界问题举行和平谈判，一面又下令印度军队前进，并向中国边防部队发动武装进攻。印度政府玩弄阴谋的最近事例是：在一九六五年，它未经宣战就向巴基斯坦发动战争。
