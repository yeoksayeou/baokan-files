With the invincible Mao Zedong Thought spreading more widely across the globe and the deepening of revolutionary armed struggles in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the great leader of the proletariat, Chairman Mao's theory on people's war is increasingly resonating with people. Revolutionary people around the world are eagerly learning from Chairman Mao's military works to apply his military theories to their own revolutionary practices.

According to incomplete statistics, in the two years since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began, China has distributed a large number of copies of "Selected Military Writings of Mao Zedong," "Chairman Mao on People's War," and various compilations and individual volumes of Chairman Mao's military works to over 130 countries and regions across the five continents. The total number of copies of Chairman Mao's military works distributed in the past two years is even greater than the total number distributed in the ten-plus years before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. For instance, "Chairman Mao on People's War" alone has been distributed in over 350,000 copies.

In the past year, China has also published several new editions. In addition to the existing English, French, and Russian editions of "Selected Military Writings of Mao Zedong," new editions in Indonesian, Spanish, and Thai have also been published. Furthermore, the Thai and Burmese editions of "Six Military Works by Chairman Mao" and the Burmese, Hindi, Thai, Vietnamese, Arabic, English, French, and Spanish editions of "Chairman Mao on People's War" have been published and distributed. There are currently 17 individual volumes of Chairman Mao's military works, with seven new topics added during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, such as "The Struggle in Jinggangshan" and "Concentrate Superior Forces to Annihilate the Enemy." Some of the existing topics have also been translated into new languages, such as "Problems of War and Strategy," which has been translated into Thai, Arabic, Swahili, Persian, and Russian. "Spark the Fire of War" has been translated into 18 languages, and "Why Can the Red Political Power in China Exist?" has been translated into 17 languages. To facilitate the study of Chairman Mao's military theories by revolutionary people around the world, China has also published a pocket-sized edition of "Selected Military Writings of Mao Zedong" in English and Indonesian, which is small, exquisite, and includes 29 of Chairman Mao's military works. This pocket-sized edition has been warmly welcomed by revolutionary people around the world.

Many countries have also translated and published large quantities of Chairman Mao's military works. According to incomplete statistics, by the end of June this year, 38 countries have published 130 editions of Chairman Mao's military works in 32 languages. Countries that have translated and published "Selected Military Writings of Mao Zedong" include those in Arabic, Italian, and Greek; countries that have translated and published "Chairman Mao on People's War" include those in Sinhala, Bengali, Italian, Telugu, English, and Swedish. Chairman Mao's brilliant works such as "Spark the Fire of War," "On Prolonged War," "Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War," "Strategic Problems of Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Warfare," "Problems of War and Strategy," and "On Rectifying the Errors in the Party's Work" have been widely translated and published in various languages by revolutionary people around the world. Countries such as India, Japan, Greece, Burma, and Italy have translated and published at least seven editions of Chairman Mao's military works, with some countries publishing up to ten editions. Countries currently engaged in revolutionary armed struggles, such as Laos, Palestine, Congo (Leopoldville), Zimbabwe, Angola, and some countries in Latin America, have overcome numerous difficulties to translate Chairman Mao's military works into their own languages, print them, or copy them by hand for study.

The broad revolutionary people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, who are fighting against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionary forces, enthusiastically welcome the widespread distribution of Chairman Mao's military works and seriously study Chairman Mao's military theories.

A Vietnamese soldier on the front lines of the anti-American struggle wrote in a letter that for soldiers like them who fight day and night in the deep mountains and dense forests, "reading Chairman Mao's military works is even more necessary." The Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party recently published an article emphasizing that studying "Selected Military Writings of Mao Zedong" is "extremely necessary" and "an urgent task" for the Indonesian Communist Party and revolutionary people in their revolutionary struggle. The article highly praises Chairman Mao's theory on people's war as "a comprehensive, systematic, and most complete Marxist-Leninist military science," stating that "it has great universal significance and points out the only path for the oppressed people of the world, especially the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, in their struggle for liberation." In a statement commemorating the 20th anniversary of the revolutionary armed struggle led by the Burmese Communist Party, the Central Committee of the Burmese Communist Party pointed out: "Practice has proven that Chairman Mao's universally applicable theory of 'political power grows out of the barrel of a gun' is correct and has immense power. Whenever there is wavering or deviation from this theory, it will bring difficulties to the revolution and cause the revolution to suffer setbacks." Many Palestinian guerrilla fighters who have read the Arabic edition of Chairman Mao's military works pointed out that through theoretical study and practical struggle, they increasingly recognize that Chairman Mao's statement that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" is a great truth. They firmly believe that people's war is the only path to liberate Palestine.

Some Congolese (Leopoldville) freedom fighters not only study Chairman Mao's works in the midst of battle but also keep them by their bedside while recovering in the hospital. They combine their actual combat experience with the study of the strategy and tactics of people's war. Many Zimbabwean African freedom fighters not only insist on studying Chairman Mao's works but also enthusiastically spread Mao Zedong Thought. They use the money they save to buy many copies of Chairman Mao's works and, risking their lives, bring these precious books to their comrades in battle and to revolutionary masses seeking truth. Revolutionary fighters in southern Africa, who are armed and fighting against the savage imperialist invaders, have a clearer understanding of the revolutionary direction and increased fighting spirit after studying Chairman Mao's works. A freedom fighter from southern Africa once believed the lies spread by revisionists about achieving national liberation through peaceful negotiations. After studying Chairman Mao's works, he realized he had been deceived. He said with deep feeling: "To achieve true national independence, armed struggle is necessary." He also said: "In the fierce class struggle, we must not harbor any illusions about the enemy; otherwise, we will fall into the trap set by the neo-colonialists. As long as we take up arms and fight to the end, we will definitely achieve national liberation."

The broad revolutionary masses in Latin America urgently need to be armed with Chairman Mao's military theories. There are often many readers writing to the Chinese publishing and distribution units, requesting that large quantities of "Selected Military Writings of Mao Zedong" and "Chairman Mao on People's War" be sent to them as soon as possible. A Colombian friend, after studying Chairman Mao's brilliant works, said: "Imperialism, reactionaries, and revisionists will not voluntarily withdraw from the historical stage; only through a prolonged and arduous revolution can the reactionaries be thoroughly overthrown until the people achieve final victory."

　　毛主席关于人民战争的理论在全世界广泛传播
　　各国被压迫人民和被压迫民族决心走武装斗争的道路
    新华社三日讯　随着战无不胜的毛泽东思想在全世界日益广泛的传播，随着亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲地区革命武装斗争的深入发展，无产阶级的伟大导师毛主席关于人民战争的理论日益深入人心。世界各国革命人民迫切需要学习毛主席的军事著作，以便把毛主席的军事理论运用于本国的革命实践。
    据不完全统计，中国无产阶级文化大革命开展两年来，我国已向全世界五大洲一百三十多个国家和地区发行了大量《毛泽东军事文选》、《毛主席论人民战争》以及毛主席的各种军事著作汇编本和单行本。毛主席的军事著作在两年中的发行总数较无产阶级文化大革命前十几年的发行量的总和还要多得多，其中《毛主席论人民战争》的发行量就达三十五万多册。
    在最近一年中我国还增加出版了一些新的文版。《毛泽东军事文选》除原有的英文、法文和俄文版外，最近又出版了印度尼西亚文、西班牙文和泰文版。此外，还出版并发行了缅文和泰文版《毛主席六篇军事著作》和缅文、印地文、泰文、越文、阿拉伯文和英、法、西班牙文等十五种文字的《毛主席论人民战争》。毛主席军事著作单行本已经出版的共有十七个选题，其中在无产阶级文化大革命期间新增加的有《井冈山的斗争》、《集中优势兵力，各个歼灭敌人》等七个选题。原有的选题的一些单行本也增加了不少新的文版，如《战争和战略问题》就新增加了泰文、阿拉伯文、斯瓦希里文、波斯文和俄文五种文版。《星星之火，可以燎原》有十八种文版，《中国的红色政权为什么能够存在？》也有十七种文版。为了便于各国革命人民随身携带学习，今年我国还特地出版了五十开本的《毛泽东军事文选》英文版和印尼文版的袖珍本。这种袖珍本小巧精致，包括二十九篇毛主席的军事著作，受到各国革命人民的热烈欢迎。
    许多国家的革命人民还自行翻译和出版了大量的毛主席军事著作。据不完全统计，到今年六月为止，已有三十八个国家用三十二种文字出版了一百三十种版本的毛主席军事著作。各国自行翻译、出版的《毛泽东军事文选》，有阿拉伯文、意大利文和希腊文等；《毛主席论人民战争》有僧伽罗文、孟加拉文、意大利文、泰卢固文、英文和瑞典文等六种文版。毛主席的《星星之火，可以燎原》、《论持久战》、《中国革命战争的战略问题》、《抗日游击战争的战略问题》、《战争和战略问题》和《关于纠正党内的错误思想》等光辉著作，经各国革命人民用各种文字翻译、出版的，更为普遍。印度、日本、希腊、缅甸、意大利等国翻译出版的毛主席军事著作的版本，至少都有七种，有的多到十种。正在进行革命武装斗争的老挝、巴勒斯坦、刚果（金）、津巴布韦、安哥拉和拉丁美洲地区的一些国家的军队、游击队和革命群众想方设法，克服种种困难，把毛主席的一些军事著作翻译成本国文字，油印出版或手抄成册，进行学习。
    正在同帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派进行斗争的亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的广大革命人民热烈欢呼毛主席军事著作的广泛传播，认真学习毛主席的军事理论。
    处在抗美救国斗争最前线的一位越南战士来信说，对我们这些日以继夜地在深山密林里同敌人坚持斗争的战士来说，“读毛主席的军事著作更加需要”。印度尼西亚共产党中央代表团最近发表文章强调指出，学习《毛泽东军事文选》对于印尼共产党人和革命人民正在进行的革命斗争是“十分需要的”，而且是“极其迫切的任务”。文章高度称赞毛主席关于人民战争的理论是“全面的、系统的和最完整的马克思列宁主义的军事科学”，“它具有伟大的普遍意义，给全世界被压迫人民、特别是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民争取解放斗争指出了必须走的唯一的道路”。缅甸共产党中央委员会在纪念缅共领导的革命武装斗争二十周年时发表的声明中指出：“实践证明：毛主席关于‘枪杆子里面出政权’这一具有普遍意义的学说是正确的，它具有无比的威力。什么时候对这个学说发生动摇，或者违背这个学说，就会给革命带来困难，使革命遭到挫折。”许多阅读过阿拉伯文版毛主席军事著作的巴勒斯坦游击队员指出，他们通过理论学习和斗争实践，越来越认识到毛主席指出的“枪杆子里面出政权”是伟大的真理。他们坚信人民战争是解放巴勒斯坦的唯一道路。
    一些刚果（金）自由战士，不仅在战斗环境中学习毛主席著作，而且在他们住院养伤期间，病床旁边也放着毛主席著作。他们结合自己的实际战斗经验，深入学习关于人民战争的战略和战术问题。不少津巴布韦非洲自由战士不仅自己坚持学习毛主席著作，而且热情地传播毛泽东思想，他们用节省下来的钱买了许多毛主席著作，冒着生命危险把宝书带给正在战斗中的战友和追求真理的革命群众阅读。手执武器同凶恶的帝国主义侵略者进行搏斗的南部非洲的革命战士在学习了毛主席的宝书以后，更加明确了革命的方向和增强了斗争的勇气。一位非洲南部的自由战士过去曾听信过修正主义分子所散布的所谓“通过和平谈判可以实现民族解放”的谎言。通过学习了毛主席著作以后，发现自己受了骗。他很有体会地说：“为了实现真正的民族独立，必须进行武装斗争。”他还说：“在激烈的阶级斗争中，我们绝对不能对敌人抱任何幻想，否则就会落入新殖民主义者设置的圈套。只要拿起武器，战斗到底，我们就一定能赢得民族解放。”
    拉丁美洲的广大革命群众迫切需要用毛主席的军事理论来武装起来。经常有许多读者来信给中国出版发行单位，要求给他们迅速寄去大量的《毛泽东军事文选》和《毛主席论人民战争》等著作。一位哥伦比亚朋友学习了毛主席的光辉著作后说：“帝国主义、反动派和修正主义是决不会自行退出历史舞台的，只有通过持久的、艰巨的革命才能够彻底推翻反动派，直到人民取得最后胜利。”
