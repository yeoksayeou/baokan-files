The working class is the main force in the scientific and technological revolution

The Revolutionary Committee member and worker, Qi De Fu: Our great leader Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "Our country has 700 million people. The working class is the leading class. We must fully bring into play the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and all work. The working class should also continuously raise its political consciousness in the struggle." China's Khrushchev and his accomplices, from the standpoint of the landlord and bourgeoisie counter-revolution, loudly proclaim that the working class "cannot be relied upon" and "must rely on the bourgeois intellectuals," crazily promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of "experts managing the institute." China's Khrushchev and his agents peddling the black goods of "experts managing the institute" is to let the bourgeois reactionary "authorities" monopolize the power of science and technology, to implement bourgeois dictatorship over the working class. We must criticize and expose it! The lowly are the wisest, the noble are the most foolish.

Worker Zhang Xu Qing: China's Khrushchev has always looked down on the workers and peasants, while elevating the bourgeois experts and professors to the heavens. In our institute, his agents boast that "workers have rough hands and shallow culture, they can only use scissors, they cannot do experiments." "Doing research requires at least a college graduate." They also parrot the black master's tone, praising those bourgeois intellectuals. Let's take a look at the two so-called "famous" bourgeois experts they highly praise!

These two fellows, as soon as they came to our institute, were placed on the "authority" throne, with cars picking them up and dropping them off, and someone accompanying them. When they go to work, they carry thick books, go into the document room to flip through books. They mystify things, claiming to have a research plan for the physiology of oak silkworms, needing to look up three years of materials in famous universities across the country. What they say is "fluent" and seems very "learned," but in fact, they have no knowledge at all. Take the breeding and rearing of oak silkworms, for example; they know nothing about it. What kind of bird eats silkworms, they don't know, even saying the ridiculous thing that "swallows eat silkworms." These two so-called "famous" experts are completely unlearned and fake experts.

Revolutionary Committee Chairman Song Shu Lin: China's Khrushchev and his agents in our institute eagerly promote bourgeois intellectuals. However, these bourgeois intellectuals do not make their masters proud. They cannot do without foreign books, cannot put down their foreign crutches, from book to book, racking their brains to do experiments, and in the end, they achieve nothing. For example, in the oak silkworm room, there is a bourgeois intellectual who does not start from production practice, sitting in the laboratory wanting to cultivate an "ideal" variety of oak silkworms. He flipped through a lot of materials, designed a "disease-resistant breeding" topic. His unique design was praised by the reactionary academic "authorities" in the institute, and immediately allocated a large amount of manpower and material resources to carry out the "disease-resistant breeding" experiment, which is detached from proletarian politics, detached from the workers and peasants, and detached from production practice. After six whole years, not a single ideal variety of oak silkworms was cultivated, but a large amount of national resources were wasted. The failure of the "disease-resistant breeding" topic fully shows that bourgeois intellectuals without practical experience, although they read many books, are the most foolish when it comes to doing things.

China's Khrushchev's agents in our institute, however, do their utmost to defame, belittle, and slander the broad masses of workers and peasants. They blabber: "Workers have rough hands, they can only use sickles, scissors, and carry baskets." "You can only believe half of what peasants say." We believe that the wealth of society is created by workers, peasants, and laboring intellectuals. They are the most knowledgeable and the most understanding of science. Breeding new varieties of oak silkworms cannot be separated from natural conditions, production practice, and the masses of workers and peasants. Liaoning Province has a history of several hundred years of silkworm rearing, and silkworm farmers have rich practical experience. We should go out the door, summarize the experience of the masses, and discover new varieties. After our opinions were put forward, the capitalist roaders immediately jumped out and viciously said, "Summarizing the experience of the masses is nonsense! It's a bear method." "The peasants of Liaoning Province have not surpassed the level of our institute." We do not listen to evil! We resolutely follow Chairman Mao's instruction to "go among the masses, learn from the masses, and summarize their experience." We sent scientific and technological personnel to the major silkworm areas of the province to learn from the silkworm farmers. In just one month, we discovered four excellent varieties of oak silkworms. The discovery of the excellent varieties from the farmers gave the capitalist roaders and reactionary academic "authorities" a resounding slap in the face. This fact fully shows that "the masses are the real heroes," and "the wisest and most talented are the warriors with the most practical experience." The workers and peasants have the most qualifications to do scientific experiments.

Worker Qie Kui En: Our institute has successfully researched ten silkworm production technical measures in the past eight years, nine of which were done by us workers. This is not only because we workers have rich practical experience, but more importantly, because we workers have a heart that is not for fame or gain, but for the revolution.

Take the research on the pesticide "kill silkworm fly," for example. We workers in the silkworm protection room discovered that many oak silkworms were parasitized by a certain parasitic fly, and it seemed that they would soon become extinct. We were very anxious, could not eat, could not sleep, and guarded the mountain all day looking for a solution. At first, we conducted many experiments, but none were successful. China's Khrushchev's agents in our institute and the reactionary academic "authorities" stood by, mocking and making trouble, and also restricting us in terms of manpower and materials. Some kind-hearted people also advised us: "There is no good way to prevent silkworm flies domestically and internationally, so you might as well give up! Even if you succeed, you will not get fame or gain." We thought: Preventing fly larvae is an urgent problem in silkworm production. We workers do not seek personal fame and gain; we want to take on the heavy responsibility for the revolution. We cannot always follow others. What does not exist domestically and internationally, we want to have. We want to bring glory to the workers and peasants and make Chairman Mao proud. We persuaded the kind-hearted people and continued the experiments. Every time we encountered difficulties, we studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "The Chinese people have spirit, have ability, and will definitely catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level in the not-too-distant future," "Young people should dare to think, dare to speak, dare to do, and display the fearless spirit of creation, and should not be intimidated by famous people or authorities." Chairman Mao's words gave us boundless wisdom and strength. Everyone was not afraid of hardships and obstacles, and resolutely decided not to rest until the problem was solved for the silkworm farmers. We workers and young technical personnel, together, after repeated experiments, finally found a way to prevent the parasitic fly of oak silkworms.

The "kill silkworm fly" research was successful. Those experts who monopolized the power of science and technology came out to grab the credit, fighting for fame and gain. Under the patronage of the capitalist roaders, they stole our research results, wrote papers, and issued reports. To put their names at the front, they tore their faces off and argued endlessly. China's Khrushchev and his black henchmen praised these unlearned and unscrupulous people who only know how to fight for fame and gain and cheat, trying to make us workers and peasants bow down to the reactionary academic "authorities," becoming their living tools; it is to let us hand over the power of scientific research to the bourgeoisie, and give them a green light to sell their black goods of "those who labor with their minds rule over those who labor with their hands."

Technician Wang Cheng Zhong: Chairman Mao teaches us: "The socialist revolution and socialist construction must adhere to the mass line, mobilize the masses, and launch a mass movement." However, China's Khrushchev and his agents in the scientific and technological field sing the opposite tune to Chairman Mao, saying that "it is not possible to conduct academic work in the form of a mass movement." They also vigorously advocate "using the forces of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois intellectuals to build socialism," and "especially relying on factory directors, engineers, and technicians." Is it the workers, peasants, and revolutionary masses with practical experience who should engage in scientific research, or is it the "factory directors, engineers, and technicians"? This is the focal point of the long-term struggle between Chairman Mao's revolutionary mass line and China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary expert line in the scientific and technological field.

Our institute's capitalist roaders, following China's Khrushchev's instructions, used various despicable tricks to actively promote the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of "experts managing the institute," opposing and interfering with Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. China's Khrushchev said, "The boundaries should be broken, and more experts should participate in the leadership group." Our institute's capitalist roaders first established the "Silkworm Society" and the "Institute Affairs Council." Under the guise of pure academic research, they invited bourgeois experts and professors into the two councils to lead the scientific research work of the institute, monopolizing the party, government, financial, and cultural power of the institute.

The "Silkworm Society" only allows experts, professors, technicians, and lecturers to participate. Ordinary technical personnel and workers do not have the right to participate. The masters of scientific research were deprived of the right to participate in scientific research and express opinions. We have rich practical experience in silkworm production, but they look down on us. They arbitrarily set topics in thin air and force us to execute them. The so-called "Silkworm Society" is not a silkworm scientific research society at all, but a club for bourgeois intellectuals and reactionary academic "authorities," a black society for carrying out capitalist restoration in our institute.

The "Institute Affairs Council" is also only for technical cadres at the level of section chief and above. These section chiefs are also "authorities" with academic titles and degrees. This so-called "Silkworm Society" and "Institute Affairs Council" indeed followed China's Khrushchev's instructions and broke the "boundaries." However, they broke the boundaries between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, truly letting the remnants of the Kuomintang and bourgeois elements sneak in.

Technician Wang Chang Jie: China's Khrushchev and our institute's capitalist roaders actively promote "experts managing the institute," which is to shield and employ bad people, and to strike and expel workers and peasants cadres.

China's Khrushchev said, "Those who engage in natural sciences are a bit confused about politics, and their destructive nature is less." Another major capitalist roader in the party shouted, "For bourgeois intellectuals, we cannot demand the level of Marxism-Leninism from them. Now we rely on them, and they can also rely on us. Even if they curse every day, they can still teach classes." Our institute's capitalist roaders also crazily shouted, "In scientific research work, we do not need to demand so much in politics." What "a bit confused about politics, less destructive," what "curse every day, can still teach classes," what "do not demand so much in politics," in a word, it is to let those reactionary experts and professors wear a legal cloak and do evil deeds against the party, the people, and Mao Zedong Thought.

Before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our institute's capitalist roaders spared no effort to recruit reactionary experts and professors from all over the place. A Kuomintang major general and extreme rightist was also invited, praised as the "top expert in the oak silkworm field." This fellow did not do good things but did evil things. In 1962, under the pretext of recuperating, he returned to Wuxi to carry out counter-revolutionary activities. Under the protection of the capitalist roaders, he was still at large. Is this so-called "politically confused person" less destructive? There was also a historical counter-revolutionary, who was regarded as a "red person" by the capitalist roaders, saying he was a "good comrade," "better than our party members." The capitalist roaders, in order to remove the "historical counter-revolutionary" hat from him, sent people to the provincial and municipal leading organs many times, and even went personally. At the same time, they promoted this fellow from an ordinary technician to a sixth-level technician. They often sent him to give lectures, study, and participate in national silkworm academic conferences. Our institute's capitalist roaders were the ones who recruited such a group of Kuomintang remnants and bourgeois experts and professors to manage the institute.

On the contrary, they regarded technical cadres and political work cadres of worker and peasant origin as thorns in their eyes and flesh in their bones. In the past eight years, eleven cadres of worker and peasant origin and demobilized soldiers have been struck and expelled. A party branch secretary, after being transferred from the army to our institute, stood out for proletarian politics, firmly grasped class struggle, and led the revolutionary masses of the entire institute to expose the restoration activities of more than ten class enemies. The capitalist roaders bore a grudge against him, gathered a gang, and put on political hat after political hat on him, and gave him a one-year probation and demotion, transferring him out of our institute. The so-called "experts managing the institute" is to let the bourgeois experts manage our politics.

Qi De Fu: China's Khrushchev and his accomplices, in order to let the bourgeois experts and reactionary "authorities" monopolize the power of scientific research, also eagerly set up frameworks and regulations, preventing us workers from doing scientific and technological experiments. The "three stricts and five fixes" system formulated by the capitalist roaders in our institute stipulates that key topics must be presided over by the section chief and the director, from the selection of topics to the details, all decided by the presiding person, and others are not allowed to casually participate in opinions. According to their regulations, the mulberry silkworm room should study the "rapid breeding" topic, and at least technicians and deputy researchers of the first level can do it. We do not have it in our institute, so we have to go to various places across the country to invite people. Seeing this, we workers are very angry. The capitalist roaders and reactionary academic "authorities" the more they desperately suppress workers from doing scientific research, the more we must bravely break through layer after layer of obstacles to do scientific research. With my heart full of loyalty to Chairman Mao, I wanted to summarize my experience of raising silkworms for more than ten years and promote it to the broad masses of silkworm farmers, promoting the development of silkworm production. Since my own cultural level is low, I found a technical employee who graduated from a technical secondary school to help summarize. We worked hard for a year or two and wrote a ten-thousand-word "Silkworm Technology," which was welcomed by workers and silkworm farmers. However, those "authorities" used the excuse that we workers do not have academic degrees and are not of the right level, took the draft, did not even look at it, and threw it aside without publishing it. They used these rules and regulations to suppress us. You suppress yours, I do mine. We must fight for this breath for the working class. I and worker Zhang Xu Qing and four other comrades summarized the experience of pruning mulberry trees. They looked down on this experience and put it in the cold palace. Later, it was printed into a small booklet by the agricultural bureau of Gaixian County and promoted.

Revolutionary Committee Standing Committee member and worker Yu Xi Zhen: Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power. The counter-revolutionaries fight to the death with revolutionary forces, also completely for the purpose of maintaining their power." The question of relying on whom, in a word, is a question of power, that is, the question of which class holds the power of science and technology, serves which class, and implements proletarian dictatorship or bourgeois dictatorship. China's Khrushchev and our institute's agents eagerly promote the line of "experts managing the institute," aiming to gather bourgeois "experts" and Kuomintang remnants, to seize the power from the proletariat, to implement bourgeois dictatorship, and to restore capitalism. The working class leads, and scientific experiments unfold a grand blueprint.

Stationed military representative Zhao Xue Gui: The great leader Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, opening the prelude to the scientific and technological revolution. We revolutionary workers and revolutionary scientific and technological personnel of the silkworm scientific research institute, together, raised the great banner of the proletarian cultural revolution, displayed the revolutionary spirit of rebellion, overthrew the tyrants, and liberated the little devils. We seized the power from the handful of capitalist roaders within the party, drove those reactionary academic "authorities" down from their thrones, and dug out the handful of traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries who were deeply hidden, establishing the revolutionary committee. We closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist scientific and technological line, and reformed the foreign teachings and old regulations. The workers, peasants, and soldiers truly grasped the fate of proletarian dictatorship, the fate of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the fate of scientific research. Those who were looked down upon by the capitalist roaders and bourgeois "expert" "authorities" in the past, the rough hands and muddy legs, became the main force of the scientific and technological revolution. The county's active learner and practitioner of Mao Zedong Thought, worker Gang Shao Bin, was previously regarded by them as a "low-awareness," "unskilled," "unreliable" big roughneck. In the revolutionary criticism, he angrily denounced China's Khrushchev and his agents in our institute for defaming and slandering the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and severely criticized the bourgeois "expert" line and the philosophy of crawling. With his boundless love for Chairman Mao and his unyielding loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, he displayed the great and fearless revolutionary spirit of the working class daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do, and took the initiative with another worker to undertake the design and research of the "oak silkworm one-step breeding" topic, and did it very well. These facts gave China's Khrushchev a blow to the head.

Technician Li Yu Zhong: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution thundered, smashing the phenomenon of the handful of capitalist roaders and bourgeois reactionary academic "authorities" ruling our institute. We workers and peasants and revolutionary scientific and technological personnel stepped onto the stage of scientific research, grasping the power of the institute. In the past, the bourgeois experts in our institute brought a variety of oak silkworms called "three-mile silk" from Zhenjiang, and cultivated it in the laboratory for seven or eight years, boasting it as the "best variety" and promoting it to the silkworm farmers. However, it was not suitable for production and was not welcomed by the masses, who called "three-mile silk" "three-death silk," and the "best variety" became the "falsest variety." Now, under the leadership of the institute's revolutionary committee and with the help of the stationed military, through revolutionary criticism, we smashed the chains on our hands and feet. We insisted on proletarian politics taking the lead, taking the road of combining with workers and peasants and combining with production practice, moving the young silkworms cultivated indoors for many years onto the mountain. The revolutionary committee sent scientific and technological personnel to conduct investigations and research in the silkworm areas, learning from the poor and lower-middle peasants, summarizing the experience of the silkworm farmers. They also invited the labor models of silkworm rearing from Gaixian County and Fengcheng to the institute, and studied new topics with the workers and scientific and technological personnel. The revolutionary committee mobilized the masses to set up small pharmaceutical factories, directly serving silkworm production. Workers and revolutionary scientific and technological personnel united, dared to think and dare to do, successfully producing the new pesticide "kill silkworm fly number three," which the expert "authorities" did not dare to think of and could not think of, filling a blank in China's silkworm scientific research. Our institute's silkworm scientific research presented a beautiful picture. Countless vivid facts fully showed the boundless wisdom and creativity of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. The facts are exactly as Chairman Mao pointed out: "As long as these people grasp their own destiny and have a Marxist-Leninist line, they can solve any difficulty in the world." "Any human miracle can be created."

Technician Chang Lun Wu: The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Intellectuals, if they do not combine with the workers and peasants, will achieve nothing." We firmly follow the socialist scientific research path indicated by Chairman Mao, implement the combination of scientific research, teaching, and production, often go deep into the silkworm areas, and humbly learn from the silkworm farmers, doing scientific experiments on the front line of class struggle and production struggle.

Once, during our investigation in the silkworm area, we discovered that more than 80% of the silkworms that were about to spin cocoons were parasitized by parasitic flies. To solve this practical problem in silkworm production, we planned to trial-manufacture a special new pesticide for killing silkworm flies. After the plan was proposed, some people thought that doing these experiments was not as valuable as doing "advanced" research, and advised us to flip through the materials and redesign the topic. We thought: Doing silkworm scientific research must start from the actual silkworm production and serve silkworm production. If you say "advanced," this is "advanced." Separating from production to do "advanced" research is a worthless "advanced," and workers and peasants do not need such "advanced" research. We absolutely cannot do such "advanced" research. We and these people studied Chairman Mao's teachings on scientific research must combine with production, severely criticized the revisionist scientific research line, and eliminated the poison of "experts managing the institute." Under the leadership of the revolutionary committee and the support of the military, the broad revolutionary masses helped us break through the shackles of foreign teachings and foreign frameworks. After dozens of repeated experiments, we overcame technical difficulties one by one and finally successfully trial-manufactured the high-efficiency new pesticide for killing silkworm flies—"kill silkworm fly number three" for the first time in China. Soon, we also relied on collective wisdom and collective efforts to successfully trial-manufacture another new pesticide with international standards.

I realized from practice that: we technical personnel of intellectual origin must put down our arrogance, be willing to be the students of the masses, and work with the workers and peasants to produce scientific research results that serve the socialist revolution and socialist construction.

Revolutionary Committee Deputy Chairman and military representative Fan Xi Kui: Recently, Chairman Mao pointed out profoundly: "Universities should still be run, and I mainly talk about engineering universities that should still be run, but the school system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, and proletarian politics should take the lead, following the road of cultivating technical personnel from workers at the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory. We should select students from workers and peasants with practical experience, go to school to study for a few years, and then return to production practice." Chairman Mao's latest instructions point out the direction of the struggle-criticism-transformation in the scientific and technological field and the road to cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, sounding the battle call to thoroughly bury China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist scientific and technological line. We, the warriors who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolution, must seriously study, deeply understand, and resolutely carry out his instructions. We must resolutely "follow the road of cultivating technical personnel from workers at the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory," select talents from the workers and peasants, and in the three great revolutionary practices, cultivate our own proletarian scientific research team, and forever grasp the power of science and technology in the hands of the working class, making scientific research better serve socialism.

    工人阶级是科学技术革命的主力军
    ——辽宁省蚕业科学研究所革命工人和驻所解放军痛斥中国赫鲁晓夫“专家治所”谬论的座谈会纪要
    革委会委员、工人齐德福：伟大领袖毛主席最近教导我们：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”中国赫鲁晓夫及其同伙，从地主、资产阶级的反革命立场出发大肆叫嚷工人阶级“不能依靠”，“要依靠资产阶级知识分子”，疯狂推行“专家治所”的反革命修正主义路线。中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人贩卖“专家治所”的黑货，就是要让资产阶级反动“权威”垄断科学技术大权，对工人阶级实行资产阶级专政，我们一定要把它批倒批臭！卑贱者最聪明！高贵者最愚蠢
    工人张绪卿：中国赫鲁晓夫一贯看不起工农群众，而把资产阶级专家教授捧上天。他在我们所的代理人胡说“工人手粗，文化浅，只能拿蚕剪子，不能搞实验。”“搞科研至少得大学生。”他们还象鹦鹉学舌一样学着黑主子的腔调，吹捧那些资产阶级知识分子。我们就看看他们极力吹捧的两个很有“名气”的资产阶级专家吧！
    这两个家伙一到我们所，就被捧上“权威”的宝座，外出车接车送，有人奉陪。上班时，夹着厚厚的书，钻进资料室翻本本。他们故弄玄虚，扬言搞一个柞蚕生理的研究计划，要到全国名牌大学查阅三年的资料。他们嘴上讲的“头头是道”，很有“学问”，其实什么学问也没有。就拿柞蚕育种、饲养来说，他们一窍不通。什么鸟吃蚕，他们也不知道，甚至说出了“燕子吃蚕”的笑话。这两个很有“名气”的专家，完全是不学无术的假专家。
    革委会主任宋树林：中国赫鲁晓夫及其在我所的代理人，极力为资产阶级知识分子捧场。这些资产阶级知识分子却不为主子“争气”。他们离不开洋本本，丢不开洋拐棍，从书本到书本，苦思冥想搞实验，搞来搞去，什么也搞不成。比如柞蚕室有个资产阶级知识分子，不从生产实际出发，坐在实验室里要培育一种“理想”的柞蚕品种。他翻阅了许多资料，设计了一个“抗病育种”的课题。他独出心裁的设计，博得了所里资产阶级反动学术“权威”的喝彩，立即调拨了大量人力、物力，搞起了脱离无产阶级政治、脱离工农群众、脱离生产实践的“抗病育种”实验。整整搞了六年，一个理想的柞蚕品种也没培育出来，却浪费了国家大量资财。“抗病育种”课题的失败，充分说明了没有实践经验的资产阶级知识分子，虽然书读得很多，但办起事来最愚蠢。
    中国赫鲁晓夫在我所的代理人，对广大工农群众却竭尽丑化、贬低、诬蔑之能事。他胡说：“工人手粗，只能拿镰刀、剪子、顶箩筐。”“农民的话只能信一半”。我们认为，社会的财富是工人、农民和劳动知识分子创造的，他们是最有学问、最懂科学的人。培育柞蚕新品种不能离开自然条件、生产实际和工农群众。辽宁省有几百年的养蚕史，蚕农有着丰富的实践经验。我们应该走出门去，总结工农群众的经验，发现新的品种。我们的意见提出以后，走资派立即跳出来狠毒地说，“总结群众经验白扯！是个熊办法”。“辽宁省农民没有超过我们所的水平”。我们不听邪！坚决遵照毛主席“我们应该走到群众中间去，向群众学习，把他们的经验综合起来”的教导，派出科学技术人员到全省主要蚕区，向蚕农学习。仅仅一个月的时间，就发现了四种优良的柞蚕品种。农家优良品种的发现，给了走资派和反动学术“权威”一记最响亮的耳光。这一事实，充分说明“群众是真正的英雄”，“最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”工农群众最有资格搞科学实验。
    工人戚奎恩：我们所最近八年研究成功了十项蚕业生产技术措施，其中九项是我们工人搞出来的。这不仅是因为我们工人有丰富的实践经验，更主要是因为我们工人有一颗不为名、不为利，一切为革命的红心。
    就拿研究农药“灭蚕蝇”来说吧。我们蚕保室工人们在饲养中发现有许多柞蚕被一种寄生蝇寄生了，眼看就要绝种。我们心里很着急，饭吃不下，觉睡不着，整天守在山上想办法。开始，我们搞了多次试验，都没成功。中国赫鲁晓夫在我们所里的代理人和资产阶级反动学术“权威”，站在一旁冷嘲热讽，百般刁难，还在人力物力上卡我们。有些好心人也劝我们：国内外都没有防治蚕蝇的好办法，你们还是算了吧！你们就是搞出来，费了劲也得不到名，得不到利。我们想：防蝇蛆是蚕业生产中急待解决的问题。我们工人不为个人名利，要为革命挑重担。我们不能老是跟着别人爬行，国内外没有的，我们要有。我们要给工农群众争光，给毛主席争气。我们说服了好心人，继续实验起来。每遇到困难，就学习毛主席的教导：“中国人民有志气，有能力，一定要在不远的将来，赶上和超过世界先进水平”，“青年人要敢想、敢说、敢干，振奋大无畏的创造精神，不要被名人、权威吓倒。”毛主席的话，给了我们无穷的智慧和力量。大家不怕艰难险阻，狠下决心，不为蚕民解决问题誓不罢休。我们工人和青年技术人员一起经过反复试验，终于找出了防治柞蚕寄生蝇的办法。
      “灭蚕蝇”研究成功了。那些把持科学技术大权的专家“权威”们，都跑了出来捞油水，争名夺利。在走资派的纵容下，他们窃取了我们的研究成果，大写论文，乱发报告。为了把自己的名字排在前头，他们撕破了脸皮，争吵不休。中国赫鲁晓夫及其黑爪牙，把这些不学无术、只会争名夺利、投机取巧的家伙吹捧得神乎其神，就是要我们工农群众拜倒在反动学术“权威”的脚下，变成他们的活工具；就是让我们把科学研究大权，拱手送给资产阶级，为他们推销“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”的黑货大开绿灯。“专家治所”的实质是资产阶级篡权
    技术员王承忠：毛主席教导我们说：“社会主义革命和社会主义建设，必须坚持群众路线，放手发动群众，大搞群众运动。”可是，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在科学技术界的代理人却同毛主席大唱反调，胡说什么“以群众运动的方式搞学术性的工作是不行的”。还竭力鼓吹“必须运用资产阶级和小资产阶级知识分子的力量来建设社会主义”，要“特别依靠厂长、工程师和技师”。是靠工人、农民和有实践经验的革命群众搞科学研究，还是靠“厂长、工程师和技师”搞科学研究？这就是毛主席革命的群众路线和中国赫鲁晓夫反革命的专家路线在科学技术界长期斗争的焦点。
    我所走资派秉承中国赫鲁晓夫的旨意，采用种种卑鄙伎俩，积极推行“专家治所”的反革命修正主义路线，对抗和干扰毛主席的革命路线。中国赫鲁晓夫胡说“应该破除界限，多有几个专家参加领导集团”。我所走资派首先建立了“蚕学会”和“所务会”。他们打着纯学术研究的幌子，把资产阶级专家教授请进两个会，让他们领导所里的科学研究工作，垄断所里的党政财文大权。
      “蚕学会”，只准专家、教授、技师、讲师参加。一般技术人员和工人都没有资格参加。科学研究的主人被剥夺了参加科学研究和发表意见的权利。我们有丰富的蚕业生产的实践经验，他们看不起。他们凭空设想订课题，硬要我们去执行。所谓“蚕学会”，根本不是蚕业科学研究会，而是资产阶级知识分子和反动学术“权威”的裴多菲俱乐部，是在我所大搞资本主义复辟的黑会。
      “所务会”，也只是室主任以上的技术干部参加。这些室主任也是有学衔、有学位的“权威”们。这个所谓的“蚕学会”和“所务会”，确实按照中国赫鲁晓夫的旨意，破除了“界限”。但是，他们破除的是共产党同国民党的界限，无产阶级和资产阶级的界限，真的让那些国民党残渣余孽和资产阶级分子钻进来了。
    技术员王昌杰：中国赫鲁晓夫及我所走资派积极推行“专家治所”，就是包庇重用坏人，打击排挤工农干部。
    中国赫鲁晓夫胡说：“搞自然科学的，对政治糊涂一些，破坏性少些。”党内另一个最大走资派叫嚷：“对资产阶级知识分子，不能用马列主义水平要求他们，现在我们要依靠他们，他们也能依靠。就是他们天天骂娘，能教课也是好的。”我所走资派也疯狂叫喊：“搞科研工作，政治上不要要求那么严。”什么“政治糊涂一些，破坏性少些”，什么“天天骂娘，能教课也是好的”，什么“政治上不要要求那么严”，拆穿一句话，就是让那些反动的专家教授披着合法的外衣，干着反党反人民反毛泽东思想的罪恶勾当。
    文化大革命前，我所走资派竭尽全力，四处网罗反动的专家教授。一个国民党少将参议员、极右分子也被他请了来，吹捧为“柞蚕界第一流专家”。这个家伙好事不干，坏事干绝。一九六二年借养病为名，回无锡大搞反攻倒算活动。在走资派的庇护下，他却逍遥法外。难道这个所谓的“政治糊涂人”，破坏性还小吗？还有一个历史反革命分子，被走资派视为“红人”，说他是“好同志”，“比我们党员强”。走资派为了给他摘掉“历史反革命分子”帽子，多次派人去省、市领导机关奔走，甚至亲自出马。同时，还把这个家伙从普通技术员，一下提为六级技师。经常派他去外地作报告、进修、参加全国蚕业学术会议。我所的走资派就是网罗了这样一批国民党的残渣余孽和资产阶级专家教授来治理所务的。
    相反，他们对工农出身的技术干部和政治工作干部却视为眼中钉、肉中刺。八年来，被打击排挤走的工农出身和部队转业的干部达十一人之多。有一位党支部书记从部队转业到我所以后，突出无产阶级政治，狠抓阶级斗争，带领全所广大革命群众，揭露了十多个阶级敌人的复辟活动。走资派对他怀恨在心，纠集娄罗，给他扣上一顶又一顶的政治帽子，并给了留党察看一年和降级降职等处分，调离我所。所谓“专家治所”就是让资产阶级专我们的政。
    齐德福：中国赫鲁晓夫及其同伙，为了让资产阶级专家、反动“权威”垄断科学研究大权，还极力划框框定制度，阻止我们工人搞科学技术实验。我所走资派制定的“三严五定”制度就规定：重点课题必须由室主任和所长主持，从选择课题到细则，都由主持人说了算，别人不得随便参加意见。按照他们的规定，桑蚕室要研究“快速育种”的课题，最低要技师、副研究员一级的才能搞。我们所里没有，就得到全国各地去请。看到这些，我们工人非常气愤。走资派和反动学术“权威”越是拚命压制工人搞科学研究，我们越是要勇敢地冲破层层阻力搞科学研究。我怀着对毛主席无限忠诚的心情，一心想把自己十几年来养蚕的经验总结出来，推广给广大蚕民，推动蚕业生产的发展。我自己文化水平低，就找了个中专毕业的技术员帮助总结。我们辛勤奋战了一两年，写出了几万字的《养蚕技术》，受到了工人和蚕民们的欢迎。可是，那些“权威”们借口我们工人没有学位，不够级别，拿过初稿一眼不看，扔在一旁不予发表。他们就是用这些条条框框卡我们。你卡你的，我干我的。我们硬要为工人阶级争这口气。我又和工人张绪卿等四位同志总结了桑树剪伐的经验。他们看不起这个经验，又给打入了冷宫。以后才由盖县农业局印成小册子推广出去。
    革委会常委、工人尤锡镇：毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”依靠谁的问题，归结到一点，就是一个政权问题，是科学技术大权掌握在那个阶级手里，为那个阶级服务，实行无产阶级专政还是资产阶级专政的根本问题。中国赫鲁晓夫及我所代理人极力推行“专家治所”的路线，其目的就是搜罗资产阶级“专家”和国民党残渣余孽，要从无产阶级手中夺去印把子，实行资产阶级专政，复辟资本主义。工人阶级当领导，科学实验展宏图
    驻所解放军赵学贵：伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，揭开了科学技术革命的序幕。我们蚕业科学研究所的革命工人和革命的科学技术人员一道，高举无产阶级文化革命的大旗，发扬无产阶级革命造反精神，打倒了阎王，解放了小鬼。我们夺了党内一小撮走资派的权，把那些反动学术“权威”从宝座上赶了下来，把藏得很深的一小撮叛徒、特务和反革命分子挖了出来，建立了革命委员会。我们紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，批判了反革命修正主义科学技术路线，改革了洋教条和旧规章制度。工农兵群众真正掌握了无产阶级专政的命运，无产阶级文化大革命的命运，科学研究的命运。过去被走资派、资产阶级“专家”“权威”们看不起的粗手、泥腿子，成了科学技术革命的主力军。县活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子、工人刚少彬，从前一直被他们看成是“觉悟低”、“不懂技术”、“不能依靠”的大老粗。在革命大批判中，他怒斥了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在我所代理人对工农兵群众的丑化和诬蔑，狠批了资产阶级“专家路线”、爬行哲学。他怀着对毛主席的无限热爱、对毛主席革命路线无比忠诚的阶级感情，发扬了工人阶级敢想、敢说、敢干的大无畏革命精神，和另一个工人主动承担了“柞蚕一化育种”课题的设计和研究，而且搞得很好。这些事实，给了中国赫鲁晓夫当头一棒。
    技术员李育忠：无产阶级文化大革命一声春雷，粉碎了党内一小撮走资派和资产阶级反动学术“权威”统治我所的现象。我们工农群众和革命科学技术人员登上了科学研究的舞台，掌握了研究所的大权。过去，我所资产阶级专家从镇江带来一种叫“三里丝”的柞蚕品种，在实验室关起门来培育了七、八年，被吹嘘为“最佳品种”推广给蚕民。可是，在生产上不适用，群众不欢迎，称“三里丝”叫“三离死”，“最佳品种”成了“最假品种”。现在，我们在所革委会领导下，在驻所解放军帮助下，通过革命大批判，砸碎了捆在手脚上的锁链。我们坚持无产阶级政治挂帅，走同工农结合、同生产实践结合的道路，把多年关在室内培育的稚蚕期柞蚕搬上了山。革委会派出科学技术人员深入蚕区调查研究，向贫下中农学习，总结蚕民的经验。还把盖县、凤城等地的养蚕劳动模范请到所里，和工人、科学技术人员一起研究新课题。革委会放手发动群众办起了小药厂，直接为蚕业生产服务。工人和革命科学技术人员团结在一起，敢想、敢干，成功地制成了专家“权威”不敢想，也想不出来的新农药——“灭蚕蝇三号”，为我国蚕业科学研究填补了一个空白点。我所蚕业科学研究展现了一幅美丽的画图。无数生动的事实，充分显示了工农兵群众的无穷的才智和创造力。事实完全象毛主席所指出的那样：“只要这些人掌握了自己的命运，又有一条马克思列宁主义的路线，不是回避问题，而是用积极的态度去解决问题，任何人间的困难总是可以解决的。”“什么人间奇迹也可以造出来。”
    技术员常伦五：伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“知识分子如果不和工农民众相结合，则将一事无成。”我们坚定不移地走毛主席指引的社会主义科学研究的道路，实行科学研究、教学同生产相结合，经常深入蚕区，虚心向蚕民学习，在阶级斗争和生产斗争的第一线搞科学实验。
    一次，我们在蚕区调查中发现，要作茧的蚕百分之八十多被寄生蝇寄生了。为了解决这个蚕业生产上的实际问题，我们打算试制一种灭蚕蝇特效新农药。方案提出以后，有些人觉得搞这些实验不如搞“尖端”价值大，劝我们还是翻翻资料，重新设计课题。我们认为：搞蚕业科学研究，必须从蚕业生产实际出发，为蚕业生产服务，要说“尖端”，这就是“尖端”。离开生产搞“尖端”，是一文不值的“尖端”，工农群众不需要这样的“尖端”，我们根本不能去搞这样的“尖端”。我们和这些人一起学习了毛主席关于科学研究必须与生产相结合的教导，狠批了修正主义科学研究路线，肃清
  “专家治所”的流毒。在革委会领导和解放军支持下，广大革命群众帮助我们冲破了洋教条、洋框框的束缚。经过几十次反复试验，攻克了一道道技术难关，终于在我国首次试制成功灭蚕蝇的高效新农药——“灭蚕蝇三号”。不久，我们又依靠集体智慧，群策群力，试制成功了另一种具有国际水平的新农药。
    我从实践中体会到：我们知识分子出身的技术员，只有放下臭架子，甘当群众小学生，和工农群众一起干，才能搞出为社会主义革命和社会主义建设服务的科学研究成果。
    革委会副主任、军代表范希睢：最近，毛主席又深刻地指出：“大学还是要办的，我这里主要说的是理工科大学还要办，但学制要缩短，教育要革命，要无产阶级政治挂帅，走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路。要从有实践经验的工人农民中间选拔学生，到学校学几年以后，又回到生产实践中去。”毛主席的最新指示，指明了科学技术界斗批改的方向和造就无产阶级革命事业接班人的道路，吹响了彻底埋葬中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义科学技术路线的战斗号角。我们无限忠于毛主席的革命战士，要认真学习，深刻领会，坚决照办。我们要坚决“走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路”，从工农群众中选拔苗子，在三大革命的实践中，培养我们无产阶级自己的科学研究队伍，把科学技术大权永远掌握在工人阶级手里，使科学研究更好地为社会主义服务。
