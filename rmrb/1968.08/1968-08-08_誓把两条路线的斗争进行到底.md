	Looking back at the tremendous victories our factory has achieved in the past two years under the guidance of the "Sixteen Points," we are full of energy. Looking ahead, we feel that our tasks are heavy and the road is long. We are determined, under the command of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, to carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat and continue to forge ahead.

	We swear to carry the struggle between the two lines to the end

	Gansu Changfeng Machinery Factory Revolutionary Committee

	Two years ago today, the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," also known as the "Sixteen Points," was issued by Chairman Mao himself. This epoch-making and programmatic document shone like a beacon, illuminating the path of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and pointing out the direction for us to carry the revolution to the end. The publication of this brilliant document boosted the morale of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, crushed the arrogance of the class enemies, thoroughly protected the broad revolutionary masses, mobilized all positive factors to the greatest extent, and strictly distinguished between the two types of contradictions. It declared the complete failure of the capitalist reactionary line pursued by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in various places, and their death sentence.

	Two years ago, Changfeng Machinery Factory was under the control of a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, who implemented a series of counter-revolutionary revisionist goods. Following the instructions of the Chinese Khrushchev, in order to restore capitalism, they turned a socialist enterprise into a capitalist one. They openly spread the theory of "class struggle extinction" within the Party, fiercely resisted Mao Zedong Thought, opposed the prominence of proletarian politics, and peddled a series of corrupt and reactionary ideas such as "technology first," "material incentives," "bonus as the commander," and "commodity first," making the factory a mess. They also colluded with traitors, spies, and remnants of the Kuomintang within the factory, acting together and doing as they pleased, long-term suppressing and persecuting revolutionary workers, practicing bourgeois dictatorship, and making the backward face of our factory unchanged for a long time.

	However, the law of historical development is always like this: where there is oppression, there is resistance. Two years ago today, when the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the factory created a white terror, brutally suppressed the revolutionary masses, and attempted to extinguish the flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution ignited by Chairman Mao, thunder roared across the vast sky. The "Sixteen Points" issued by Chairman Mao himself were published! We, the broad masses of the proletarian revolutionaries who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, followed the brilliant path indicated by the "Sixteen Points," stood firmly on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, held high the banner of "Rebellion against reactionaries is justified," and directed our struggle against the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in our factory. Under the influence of the January Revolution in Shanghai, we seized the power of the Party, government, finance, and culture that a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party had long usurped, and established a revolutionary committee of three-in-one combination in late October last year. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, and a great victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

	Looking back at the nearly ten months our factory's revolutionary committee has gone through, it was not smooth sailing. Just as Chairman Mao taught us: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution under the conditions of socialism, a revolution by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and the Kuomintang reactionaries led by the broad revolutionary masses, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." In this life-and-death class struggle, the class enemies are not willing to accept their failure and annihilation. They are still alive but their hearts are not dead. They hate the newly born revolutionary committee to death and are terrified of it. Together with a handful of traitors, spies, and remnants of the Kuomintang, they always probe for opportunities, waiting for a chance to counterattack. Once they get a chance, they jump out. They either spread the rightist wind of reversing verdicts, attempting to confuse the class lines and shift the direction of the struggle; or they sharpen their wits to infiltrate the newly born revolutionary power, conspiring to collaborate internally and externally to undermine the revolutionary committee; or they fire sugar-coated bullets, trying to win over and corrupt the revolutionary masses, attempting to achieve their evil goal of restoring capitalism and regain the paradise they have lost. In this intense and complex class struggle, our factory's revolutionary committee has always remembered Chairman Mao's great teaching of "Never forget class struggle," followed the brilliant path indicated by the "Sixteen Points," mobilized and organized all members of the revolutionary committee to stand firmly on the front line of class struggle, leading all revolutionary masses in the factory to fight a life-and-death battle with the class enemies time and time again, and achieve victory after victory. Therefore, the process of consolidating and developing our factory's revolutionary committee is also the process of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and the process of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line achieving victory after victory.

	Through the practice of class struggle, we deeply understand that the newly born revolutionary power is hard-won; we deeply understand that with power, we have everything. Therefore, we must defend the revolutionary power with struggle and build the newly born revolutionary committee with Mao Zedong Thought. "Navigating the vast sea relies on the helmsman, and making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." To build our revolutionary committee into a strong command post that highlights proletarian politics and firmly establishes Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary committee has, since its establishment, always put the campaign of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in practice at the forefront of all work. Through organizing various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, carrying out the "Three Loyalty" activities, and holding Mao Zedong Thought lectures, Mao Zedong Thought has been widely popularized in our factory. Currently, the high tide of revolutionary criticism is surging higher and higher. Even white-haired old ladies and children a few years old are all participating in the struggle, criticism, and transformation within the factory, thus powerfully promoting the work of streamlining administration and cleaning up the class ranks.

	"Mao Zedong Thought, when grasped by the broad masses, will turn into boundless power, into an invincible spiritual atomic bomb." The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a powerful driving force for the development of productive forces in our country. Many vivid facts in our factory fully prove this truth. The entire factory has seen a scene of unprecedented enthusiasm in revolution and production. Since last October, production has been rising month by month. Just in terms of product value, the amount completed in the first half of this year is equal to twenty-nine times that of the same period before the Cultural Revolution.

	Looking back at the tremendous victories achieved in the past two years under the guidance of the "Sixteen Points," we are full of energy. Looking ahead, we feel that our tasks are heavy and the road is long. We deeply understand that in the current situation of great progress, a handful of unrepentant capitalist roaders and class enemies hidden within will not accept their failure. They are still using various means to struggle with us. "It is better to pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining strength than to learn from King Xiang Yu and seek fame." We must carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, fight for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line while living, and die for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We must resolutely smash the plots and tricks of a handful of class enemies and strive for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

### 誓把两条路线的斗争进行到底
甘肃长风机器厂革命委员会

专栏：

    回顾两年来我厂在“十六条”指引下取得的巨大胜利，我们浑身是劲，展望将来，感到任重而道远。我们决心在毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的号令下，发扬无产阶级的彻底革命精神，继续奋勇前进——
　　誓把两条路线的斗争进行到底
　　甘肃长风机器厂革命委员会
    两年前的今天，毛主席亲自主持制定的《中国共产党中央委员会关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》即“十六条”公布啦。这个划时代的纲领性的文件，象一座光芒四射的灯塔，照亮了无产阶级文化大革命的前进道路，给我们指出了把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的胜利航向。这个光辉文件的公布，大长了无产阶级革命派的志气，大灭了阶级敌人的威风，最彻底地保护了广大革命群众，最大限度地调动了一切积极因素，最严格地区分了两类不同性质的矛盾。它宣告了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在各地代理人所推行的资产阶级反动路线的彻底破产，宣告了他们的死刑。
    两年前，长风机器厂在党内一小撮走资派把持下，推行了一系列反革命修正主义黑货。他们秉承中国赫鲁晓夫的旨意，为了复辟资本主义，把一个社会主义企业变为资本主义企业，在党内公开散布“阶级斗争熄灭”论，疯狂抵制毛泽东思想，反对突出无产阶级政治，贩卖“技术至上”、“物质刺激”、“奖金挂帅”、“商品第一”等一系列腐朽反动的东西，把工厂搞得乌烟瘴气。他们还在厂内勾结叛徒、特务和国民党残渣余孽，狼狈为奸，为所欲为，长期压制和迫害革命职工，实行资产阶级专政，使我厂的落后面貌长期不能改变。
    可是，历史发展的规律总是这样，那里有压迫，那里就有反抗。两年前的今天，当中国赫鲁晓夫及其在厂内的代理人，制造白色恐怖，残酷镇压革命群众，妄图把毛主席点燃的无产阶级文化大革命烈火扑灭时，春雷震响了万里长空，毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”公布啦！我们无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席革命路线的广大无产阶级革命派，沿着“十六条”所指引的光辉道路，坚定地站在毛主席革命路线上，高举对反动派造反有理的大旗，把斗争矛头对准中国赫鲁晓夫及其在我厂的代理人。在上海“一月革命”风暴的影响下，夺了一小撮党内走资派长期窃取的党、政、财、文大权，于去年十月下旬建立了三结合的革命委员会。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，这是毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利。
    回顾我厂革委会近十个月所走过的道路，并不是一帆风顺的。正象毛主席教导我们的：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”在这场阶级斗争的生死大搏斗中，阶级敌人是不甘心他们的失败与灭亡的。他们人还在，心不死。他们对新生的革委会恨得要死，怕得要命，伙同一小撮叛徒、特务和国民党残渣余孽，时时窥测方向，伺机反扑，一有机会，就跳将出来。他们或刮起右倾翻案妖风，企图扰乱阶级阵线，转移斗争大方向；或削尖脑袋钻进新生的革命政权，阴谋里应外合，搞垮革命委员会；或施放糖衣炮弹，拉拢腐蚀革命群众，妄想达到他们复辟资本主义的罪恶目的，恢复已经失去的天堂。在这场激烈复杂的阶级斗争中，我们厂革委会牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，沿着“十六条”指引的光辉道路，发动和组织革委会全体成员，坚决站在阶级斗争第一线，带领全厂革命群众，一次又一次，同阶级敌人作殊死的斗争，不断取得胜利。因此，我厂革委会巩固与发展的过程，也就是落实毛主席最新指示的过程，是毛主席革命路线取得节节胜利的过程。
    通过阶级斗争的实践，我们深深体会到，新生的革命政权，来之不易；我们深深懂得，有了政权，就有了一切。因此，我们必须用战斗来保卫革命政权，用毛泽东思想建设新生的革命委员会。“大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”为了把我们革委会建设成一个突出无产阶级政治的、大立毛泽东思想的坚强战斗指挥部，革委会自成立以来，始终把开展活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，放在一切工作的首位，通过大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，开展“三忠于”活动，举办毛泽东思想讲用会，使毛泽东思想在我厂得到空前大普及。目前，革命大批判的高潮一浪高过一浪，就连白发苍苍的老太太和几岁的儿童，也人人口诛笔伐，个个挥戈上阵，积极参加了厂内的斗、批、改，从而有力地促进了精兵简政与清理阶级队伍的工作。
    “毛泽东思想为广大群众所掌握，就会变成无穷无尽的力量，变成威力无比的精神原子弹。”无产阶级文化大革命是使我国社会生产力发展的一个强大的推动力。我厂许多生动的事实，充分证实了这条真理。全厂革命和生产出现了从未有过的热气腾腾的新景象。从去年十月以来，生产月月上升，仅产品产值一项，今年上半年完成的就等于文化大革命前同期的二十九倍。
    回顾两年来在“十六条”指引下取得的巨大胜利，我们浑身是劲，展望将来，感到任重而道远。我们深深知道，在当前一派大好形势下，一小撮顽固不化的走资派和隐藏在内部的阶级敌人，决不甘心他们的失败，他们还在采取各种手段同我们作斗争。“宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”我们一定要发扬无产阶级的彻底革命精神，生为毛主席的革命路线而战斗，死为毛主席的革命路线而献身，坚决粉碎一小撮阶级敌人的阴谋诡计，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利而奋斗。
