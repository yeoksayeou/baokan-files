    Quotations from Chairman Mao
    Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully bring into play the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in all work. The working class should also, in the course of struggle, constantly raise its political consciousness.
