Support the PLA, Learn from the PLA
Mother of Soldiers Rong Guanxiu

On the 41st anniversary of the founding and leadership of our great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao and the direct command of Vice Chairman Lin of the People's Liberation Army of China, we, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary people, with boundless loyalty, love, admiration, and worship for Chairman Mao, shout long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live! Long live the great People's Liberation Army of China!

On this glorious day, we express our deepest respect and gratitude to our soldiers. With their support, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our Xiaopansong Production Brigade has achieved great victories.

At the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in our brigade, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, launched a fierce attack on the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents. The great waves of the Cultural Revolution shattered the dreams of a small handful of class enemies who attempted to restore capitalism. However, class enemies will not disappear on their own. The capitalist-roaders and the untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in our brigade colluded together, crazily promoting the reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev, playing tricks, shooting from the shadows, spreading rumors, deceiving some unaware masses, manipulating mass organizations, reversing the direction of struggle, and spreading a rightist reversal wind, directing the spearhead at the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres. At that time, I thought, with Chairman Mao supporting us poor and lower-middle peasants and the support and protection of the People's Liberation Army of China, "No matter how the reactionaries try to stop the march of history, revolution will inevitably occur and will surely triumph." The facts are indeed like this.

Just when we were in the most difficult situation, the People's Liberation Army of China, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instruction to "support the leftist broad masses," came to our Xiaopansong Production Brigade. They propagated the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to us broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, greatly inspiring our revolutionary spirit. The soldiers lived, ate, worked, and studied with us poor and lower-middle peasants, together criticizing the bourgeoisie. They deeply implemented and executed the Party's policies, raising everyone's awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. With the support of the PLA, we launched a revolutionary big criticism, exposing the rightist reversal wind, uncovering the counter-revolutionary two-faced individuals, and repelling the class enemies' attacks, putting our brigade's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution back on the correct track as guided by Chairman Mao.

At this very moment, the class enemies directed their spearhead at the PLA. To thoroughly smash the class enemies' rampant attacks, we broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, deeply studying Chairman Mao's writings on class and class struggle, further arming ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, and gaining a clear understanding of the new trends, new characteristics, and new problems in class struggle. Armed with Mao Zedong Thought, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and the PLA together launched a struggle against the enemy, focusing on revolutionary big criticism, making the class enemies' plots fail again, and strongly consolidating and developing the great alliance and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination."

After our brigade established a new leadership cadre, the class enemies, feeling their days were numbered, directed their spearhead at the revolutionary government, trying to sow discord among the cadres to achieve their goal of destroying the revolutionary government. To thoroughly strike down the enemy, the PLA fought shoulder to shoulder with the revolutionary masses, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, launching a fierce attack on the class enemies, thoroughly smashing the class enemies' counterattack, and consolidating the newly born revolutionary government.

The practice of revolutionary struggle has eloquently proved that Chairman Mao's great instruction: "The unity of the army and people is as one, see who can stand against us," is an unbreakable great truth.

"Support the army, love the people" is Chairman Mao's consistent brilliant idea, and it is one of the important guarantees for achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Our "supporting the army" is the most resolute support for the dictatorship of the proletariat, the most resolute support for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and the most resolute support for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Executing or not executing Chairman Mao's instruction of "support the army, love the people" is a major issue of whether one is loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We must resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words, fully implement Chairman Mao's instruction of "support the army, love the people," and do a good job in "supporting the army" to further strengthen the relationship between the army and the people.

Chairman Mao calls on us: "The whole nation should learn from the People's Liberation Army." We learn from the PLA by supporting them in carrying out the glorious tasks of "three supports, two militaries," learning from their consistently correct political direction, learning from their emphasis on proletarian politics, adhering to the fine traditions of the Four Firsts and the Three-Eight Style, learning from their unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, unlimited loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without a people's army, there is nothing for the people." We resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words, always stand with the People's Liberation Army, closely follow the great leader Chairman Mao, and strive for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!

Support the army, love the people, the army and people form an iron wall to defend the dictatorship of the proletariat and the socialist mountains. This is the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team of the Kaiping Coal Mine performing for the stationed PLA. Photo by Xinhua News Agency reporter.

　　拥护解放军，学习解放军
　　子弟兵母亲　戎冠秀
    在我们伟大统帅毛主席亲自缔造和领导、林副主席直接指挥的中国人民解放军建军四十一周年的时候，我们广大贫下中农和革命群众，怀着对毛主席无限忠诚、无限热爱、无限敬仰、无限崇拜的无产阶级感情，高呼毛主席万岁！万万岁！伟大的中国人民解放军万岁！
    在这光辉的节日里，我们以万分崇敬的心情，感谢我们的子弟兵。在他们的支持下，我们下盘松大队的无产阶级文化大革命，取得了伟大的胜利。
    在无产阶级文化大革命开始时，我们大队的广大贫下中农，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，向中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人，展开了猛烈的进攻。文化大革命的巨浪，冲垮了一小撮阶级敌人企图复辟资本主义的迷梦。但是阶级敌人是不会自行消灭的。我们大队的走资派和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子勾结在一起，疯狂推行中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线，耍阴谋，放暗箭，造谣言，蒙蔽一些不明真相的群众，操纵群众组织，扭转斗争方向，大刮右倾翻案妖风，把矛头对准了广大贫下中农和革命干部。当时我就想，有毛主席给我们广大贫下中农撑腰，有中国人民解放军的支持和保卫，“不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”事实确是这样。
    正当我们处境最困难的时候，中国人民解放军遵照毛主席“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的指示，来到了我们下盘松大队，给我们广大贫下中农宣传了战无不胜的毛泽东思想，极大地鼓舞了我们的革命斗志。解放军和我们贫下中农同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习，一起批判资产阶级。他们深入贯彻执行党的方针政策，使大家提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟。在解放军的支持下，我们展开了革命大批判，大揭右倾翻案妖风的内幕，揪出了反革命两面派，打退了阶级敌人的进攻，使我们大队的无产阶级文化大革命走上了毛主席指引的正确轨道。
    正在这个时候，阶级敌人又把矛头指向解放军。为了彻底粉碎阶级敌人的猖狂进攻，我们广大贫下中农大办毛泽东思想学习班，深入学习毛主席有关阶级和阶级斗争的论述，进一步用毛泽东思想武装自己，对阶级斗争的新动向，新特点，新问题有了明确的认识。用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大贫下中农和解放军一起，展开了对敌斗争，狠抓革命大批判，使阶级敌人的阴谋诡计又一次破产，有力地巩固和发展了革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”。
    我们大队建立了新的领导班子以后，阶级敌人感到日暮途穷，又把矛头对准了革命政权，挑拨干部之间的团结，妄图达到破坏革命政权的目的。为了彻底打击敌人，解放军又和广大革命群众并肩战斗，以毛泽东思想为武器，对阶级敌人展开了猛烈的进攻，彻底粉碎了阶级敌人又一次反扑，巩固了新生的革命政权。
    革命斗争实践，雄辩地证明了毛主席的伟大指示：“军民团结如一人，试看天下谁能敌”，是一个颠扑不破的伟大真理。
      “拥军爱民”，是毛主席一贯的光辉思想，是当前夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的重要保证之一。我们“拥军”，就是最坚定地拥护无产阶级专政，就是最坚定地拥护毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就是最坚定地拥护战无不胜的毛泽东思想。执行不执行毛主席“拥军爱民”的指示，是忠不忠于毛主席，忠不忠于毛泽东思想，忠不忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的大问题。我们要坚决听毛主席的话，全面落实毛主席“拥军爱民”的指示，切实做好“拥军”工作，进一步密切军民关系。
    毛主席号召我们：“全国学人民解放军”。我们学习解放军，就要支持他们执行“三支”“两军”的光荣任务，学习他们始终一贯地坚定正确的政治方向，学习他们突出无产阶级政治，坚持四个第一、三八作风的优良传统，学习他们无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席革命路线的崇高品质。
    毛主席教导我们：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”我们坚决听毛主席的话，和人民解放军永远在一起，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利而奋斗到底！（附图片）
