	Resolutely Eliminate the Poison of the Bourgeois Headquarters
	National Agricultural Labor Model Worker, Deputy Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Revolutionary Committee Geng Changsuo

Two years ago today, our great leader Chairman Mao issued the "Bombard the Headquarters" big-character poster at the Eleventh Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee. Chairman Mao's big-character poster was the decisive blow against the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev, ensuring that our party and state will never change color. Over the past two years, the broad masses of the proletarian revolutionary forces and hundreds of millions of revolutionary people have responded to Chairman Mao's great call to arms, launching a fierce offensive against the bourgeois headquarters. After repeated struggles, we have exposed China's Khrushchev and his agents in various places, one by one, and seized back the power over party, government, finance, and culture that they had usurped, smashing their evil plot to restore capitalism in China. In this intense class struggle, revolutionary committees have been established throughout the country, greatly strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat. This is a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, a glorious achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are aimed at seizing power and consolidating power. The counter-revolutionaries' desperate struggle against revolutionary forces is entirely for the purpose of maintaining their power." At this critical moment when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is nearing complete victory, a handful of class enemies, unwilling to accept their doom, are still making their last-ditch struggles. They change tactics and use various tricks and conspiracies, directing their attacks at the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and at the newly established revolutionary committees. We must not let these scoundrels succeed in their plots! We must closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, focus on class struggle, and thoroughly clean up the class ranks. We must launch a fierce attack on the die-hard capitalist-roaders, traitors, spies, and unrepentant landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, exposing them one by one, overthrowing them, and ensuring they never rise again! We must carry out a deep and sustained revolutionary criticism, thoroughly eliminating all the poison spread by the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev, ensuring that our proletarian ironclad state will never change color!

　　坚决肃清资产阶级司令部的毒害
　　全国农业劳动模范、河北省革命委员会副主任　耿长锁
    两年前的今天，我们伟大领袖毛主席在八届十一中全会上发表了《炮打司令部》的大字报。毛主席的大字报，是摧毁以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部的决定性一炮，是保证我们党和国家永不变色的决定性一炮。两年来，广大无产阶级革命派和亿万革命群众，响应毛主席的伟大战斗号召，向资产阶级司令部发动了猛烈进攻。经过反复较量，把中国赫鲁晓夫及其在各地的代理人一个个地揪了出来，夺回了被他们篡夺去的那部分党、政、财、文大权，粉碎了他们妄图在中国复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋。在这场激烈的阶级斗争中，全国各地成立了革命委员会，极大地强化了无产阶级专政，这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌战果！
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”在无产阶级文化大革命接近全面胜利的关键时刻，一小撮阶级敌人不甘心于他们的灭亡，他们还在作垂死的挣扎。他们变换各种花招，施展各种阴谋诡计，把攻击的矛头指向以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，指向新生的革命委员会。我们决不能让这些家伙的阴谋得逞！我们一定要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，大抓特抓阶级斗争，切实认真地做好清理阶级队伍的工作，向一小撮顽固不化的走资派、叛徒、特务和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子猛烈进攻，把他们一个个地揪出来，打翻在地，让他们永世不得翻身！我们必须深入持久地开展革命的大批判，把以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部所散布的一切流毒，彻底肃清，保证我们无产阶级的铁打江山永不变色！
