The great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "Universities should still be run. I am mainly talking about technical and engineering universities, but the school system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, and proletarian politics should be in command, following the path of the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory in cultivating technical personnel from among workers. Students should be selected from workers and peasants with practical experience, sent to school for a few years, and then return to production practice."

Chairman Mao's latest instructions have greatly educated and inspired the graduates of higher education institutions in Shaanxi Province. They are determined to respond to the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao, to follow the path of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers as pointed out by Chairman Mao, to go to the countryside, to the border, to factories, and to the grassroots, to become laborers with socialist consciousness and culture, and to temper themselves into successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause in the great storms of class struggle.

Chairman Mao's latest instructions have given the graduates of various institutions in Shaanxi unlimited fighting strength. After studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, they immediately launched a deeper criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line promoted by Liu Shaoqi and his agents. Graduates from Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an Military Communication Engineering Institute, Xi'an Metallurgical and Architectural Institute, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Northwest Industrial University, Xi'an Medical University, Northwest University, Xi'an Mining Institute, and Shaanxi Industrial University, with their personal experiences, angrily denounced and criticized the heinous crimes of Liu Shaoqi and his agents in promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist line in issues such as graduate placement. They pointed out that Chairman Mao's latest instructions have once again shown us the direction of progress and depicted a magnificent picture of proletarian education. We, the revolutionary youngsters who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, must act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, thoroughly discard the airs of university students, go to the front lines of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation, go to the most difficult places, treat workers, peasants, and soldiers as teachers, be lifelong students of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and become laborers with socialist consciousness and culture.

Chairman Mao's inscription in Yan'an to the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University teaches us: "The dividing line between revolutionary and non-revolutionary or counter-revolutionary intellectuals lies in whether they are willing and able to integrate with the workers and peasants. The dividing line is only this." While studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the graduates of various institutions also reviewed Chairman Mao's great teachings. They believe that whether one is willing and able to face the countryside, the border, factories, and the grassroots, and to follow the path of integrating with workers and peasants, is a major issue of loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and a new severe test for every graduate. Insisting on the "four faces" is a need for socialist revolution and socialist construction, a need to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and a long-term strategy for anti-revisionism and preventing revisionism. They said, we must use Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a weapon, resolutely fight against class enemies, and fight against the poison of the revisionist educational line, bourgeois ideology, and old habits, and at the same time, we must thoroughly break with the bourgeois "self" in our minds.

The vast majority of graduates solemnly pledged before Chairman Mao's portrait that they would definitely achieve "Chairman Mao waves his hand, I advance," and "everything submits to Chairman Mao." Many graduates who served as leaders of the revolutionary committees at the school and department levels took the lead in signing up to settle down in the countryside and on the border, to be the people's ox for life, and to pull the revolutionary cart for life.

    陕西大专院校毕业生决心做有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者
    拜工农兵为师　到农村到边疆落户
    据新华社西安二十日电　伟大领袖毛主席最近深刻地指出：“大学还是要办的，我这里主要说的是理工科大学还要办，但学制要缩短，教育要革命，要无产阶级政治挂帅，走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路。要从有实践经验的工人农民中间选拔学生，到学校学几年以后，又回到生产实践中去。”毛主席的最新指示，极大地教育和鼓舞了陕西省大专院校毕业生。他们决心响应伟大领袖毛主席的伟大号召，走毛主席指出的同工农兵相结合的道路，到农村去，到边疆去，到工矿去，到基层去，做一个有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，把自己锻炼成无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    毛主席的最新指示，给陕西各院校毕业生增加了无穷的战斗力量。他们学习了毛主席的最新指示，立即对中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人推行的反革命修正主义教育路线开展了更加深刻的大批判。陕西师范大学、西安军事电讯工程学院、西安冶金建筑学院、西安交通大学、西北工业大学、西安医学院、西北大学、西安矿业学院、陕西工业大学等大专院校的毕业生，以亲身经历，愤怒控诉和批判了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在毕业生分配等问题上推行反革命修正主义路线的滔天罪行。他们指出，毛主席的最新指示又一次给我们指明了前进的方向，为我们描绘了无产阶级教育事业的宏伟图景。我们无限忠于毛主席的革命小将，就是要照毛主席的指示办事，彻底丢掉大学生架子，到阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验的第一线去，到最艰苦的地方去，拜工农兵为师，当一辈子工农兵的小学生，做一个有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。
    毛主席在延安给抗大的题词教导我们：“知识分子之成为革命的或不革命的或反革命的分界，看其是否愿意并且实行结合工农民众，他们的分界仅仅在这一点。”各大专院校毕业生在学习毛主席最新指示的同时，重温了毛主席的这一伟大教导。他们认为，愿意不愿意、并且实行不实行面向农村，面向边疆，面向工矿，面向基层，走与工农相结合的道路，是对毛主席的革命路线忠不忠的大问题，是对每个毕业生新的严峻考验。坚持“四个面向”，是社会主义革命和社会主义建设的需要，是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的需要，是反修防修的百年大计。他们说，我们一定要以毛主席的最新指示为武器，坚决同阶级敌人进行斗争，同修正主义教育路线的流毒、资产阶级思想影响和旧习惯势力进行斗争，同时也要和自己头脑里资产阶级的“私”字彻底决裂。
    广大毕业生纷纷在毛主席像前庄严宣誓，一定要做到
  “毛主席挥手我前进”，“一切服从毛主席”。不少担任了校、系革委会负责人的毕业生，带头报名到农村、到边疆安家落户，做一辈子人民的牛，拉一辈子革命的车。
