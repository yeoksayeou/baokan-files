Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and with the warm concern of Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters, the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Guangxi is unprecedentedly good. The main manifestations are: the great thought of Mao Zedong is unprecedentedly widespread; a small handful of class enemies have been severely struck; and the unity between the military and the people is continually strengthening.

The proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad masses of revolutionaries in Guangxi, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong thought, have been relentlessly attacking the class enemies, seizing decisive victories in the Cultural Revolution. In the entire region, four cities, eight prefectures, and 82 counties, more than 90% of the rural people's communes, the Liuzhou Railway Bureau, and its affiliated subdivisions have all established revolutionary committees. The vast cities and countryside are brimming with a thriving revolutionary scene.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, August 24th: Under the brilliant illumination of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and with the warm concern of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, the proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad masses of revolutionaries in Guangxi, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong thought, have been relentlessly attacking a small handful of class enemies, seizing decisive victories in the Cultural Revolution, and the revolutionary situation is unprecedentedly good and getting better and better.

Over the past two years, the proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad masses of revolutionaries in Guangxi, holding high the revolutionary banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against the reactionaries," have extensively and deeply exposed, criticized, and fought against the counter-revolutionary crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Central-South and Guangxi. They have repeatedly repelled the frenzied counterattacks of the class enemies. In the great march to seize the overall victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad masses of revolutionaries have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, grasped class struggle, further deepened and prolonged the revolutionary criticism, and in the struggle, consolidated and developed the great alliance and the three-in-one combination of the revolution. Revolutionary committees have been established from the bottom up throughout the region. So far, revolutionary committees have been established in all four cities, eight prefectures, and 82 counties in the entire autonomous region. Revolutionary committees have also been established in the Liuzhou Railway Management Bureau and its various subdivisions. More than 90% of the rural people's communes have also established revolutionary committees. The vast cities and countryside are brimming with a thriving revolutionary scene.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The day the people are happy is the day the counter-revolutionaries are miserable." The closer the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to overall victory, the more profound and complex the class struggle becomes. The handful of capitalist roaders within the party, led by the Chinese Khrushchev, and their agents in Guangxi, a handful of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist roaders, other counter-revolutionaries, and untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, in the face of the increasingly good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Guangxi, have used various counter-revolutionary tricks to frantically create a series of counter-revolutionary incidents, attempting to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. At this critical moment of fierce struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads, the workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and the broad masses of revolutionaries in Guangxi, under the leadership of the Guangxi Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group and with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army, have criticized the reactionary bourgeois "multi-center theory," criticized various manifestations of the bourgeois reactionary worldview, closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and resolutely carried out the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. They have united all forces that can be united, formed a mighty revolutionary army, carried forward the revolutionary spirit of "pursuing the fleeing enemy with remaining strength," launched an even more fierce attack on a small handful of class enemies, smashed the counter-revolutionary evil plots of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Central-South and Guangxi, and further developed the great revolutionary situation.

The main manifestations of the current great situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Guangxi are as follows: First, the great thought of Mao Zedong is unprecedentedly widespread, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is even more deeply rooted in people's hearts. On the basis of extensively and deeply propagating Mao Zedong thought and holding various types of Mao Zedong thought study classes in the previous period, in the past two months, the entire region, with workers, peasants, and soldiers as the main body, has dispatched 53,000 propaganda teams consisting of more than 700,000 people to convey and expound Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the latest battle orders of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin to the revolutionary masses of all ethnic groups in the entire autonomous region. At the same time, 127,800 Mao Zedong thought study classes have been held, with 3,320,000 people participating in the study. Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the latest battle orders of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin have deeply entered people's hearts, becoming known to every household, greatly raising the class struggle consciousness and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad masses of revolutionaries.

Second, a small handful of class enemies have been severely struck, and proletarian dictatorship has been unprecedentedly consolidated. The proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad masses of revolutionaries throughout the region, in connection with the actual class struggle in their local areas and units, have seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instruction that "the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is essentially a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and its led broad revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." They have continuously strengthened the struggle against the enemy, deeply and persistently carried out revolutionary criticism, launched relentless and fierce attacks on a small handful of class enemies, and firmly, accurately, and ruthlessly struck a small handful of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist roaders, and other counter-revolutionaries, achieving great victories in the struggle against the enemy.

Third, in carrying out the "support the army and love the people" movement and implementing Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness," a new situation has emerged. The broad masses of soldiers and civilians have fought side by side in the stormy class struggle, forging an even deeper revolutionary friendship, with the army loving the people and the people supporting the army, and the unity between the army and the people is continually strengthening. Agricultural production, after achieving a bumper harvest last year, has again achieved a bumper harvest this year for early rice. Revolutionary new order has been established in the vast cities and countryside.

The broad cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army Guangxi Military Region and the stationed troops, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong thought, have resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's great order of "the People's Liberation Army should support the broad leftist masses," using the invincible Mao Zedong thought to propagate, arm, and organize the masses, fighting side by side with the broad masses of revolutionaries. In carrying out the "three supports" and "two militaries" tasks, they have made great contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Guangxi.

    在毛主席一系列最新指示指引下，在毛主席的无产阶级司令部亲切关怀下
    广西无产阶级文化大革命形势空前大好
    主要表现是：伟大的毛泽东思想空前大普及；沉重打击了一小撮阶级敌人；军民团结不断加强
    无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，不停顿地向阶级敌人猛烈进攻，夺得了文化大革命的决定性胜利。全区四个市，八个专区，八十二个县，百分之九十以上的农村人民公社，柳州铁路局和所属各分局，全部成立革命委员会。广大城乡一片蓬蓬勃勃革命景象。
    据新华社南宁二十四日电　在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的光辉照耀下，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的亲切关怀下，广西无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，不停顿地向一小撮阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻，夺得文化大革命的决定性胜利，革命形势空前大好，越来越好。
    两年多来，广西无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，高举“对反动派造反有理”的革命大旗，对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在中南、广西的代理人的反革命罪行，展开了广泛深入的大揭发、大批判、大斗争，一次又一次地打退了阶级敌人的疯狂反扑。在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的大进军中，无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，狠抓阶级斗争，进一步深入持久地开展革命大批判，在斗争中巩固和发展了革命的大联合和革命的三结合，全区自下而上地逐级建立了革命委员会。到目前为止，全自治区四个市，八个专区和八十二个县，全部成立了革命委员会。柳州铁路管理局和所属各个分局，全部成立了革命委员会。百分之九十以上的农村人民公社，也成立了革命委员会。广大城乡到处是一片蓬蓬勃勃的革命景象。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“人民大众开心之日，就是反革命分子难受之时。”无产阶级文化大革命越是接近全面胜利，阶级斗争越是深刻，越是复杂。以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在广西的代理人，一小撮叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派、其他反革命分子和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，在广西无产阶级文化大革命形势越来越好的情况下，施展种种反革命伎俩，疯狂地制造一系列反革命事件，妄图破坏无产阶级文化大革命。在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线进行激烈的大搏斗的关键时刻，广西工人阶级、贫下中农和广大革命群众，在广西革命委员会筹备小组的带领下，在人民解放军的大力支持下，批判了反动的资产阶级的“多中心论”，批判了资产阶级反动世界观的各种表现，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚决贯彻执行以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的战斗号令，团结一切可以团结的力量，组成浩浩荡荡的革命大军，发扬“宜将剩勇追穷寇”的革命精神，向一小撮阶级敌人发起了更加猛烈的进攻，粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在中南和广西的代理人等一小撮阶级敌人的反革命罪恶阴谋，进一步发展了革命大好形势。
    广西目前无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势的主要表现是：一，伟大的毛泽东思想空前大普及，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线更加深入人心。在前一个时期广泛深入地宣传毛泽东思想和大办各种类型毛泽东思想学习班的基础上，近两个月来，全区又以工农兵为主体，出动了由七十多万人组成的五万三千多个毛泽东思想宣传队，向全自治区各族革命群众原原本本地传达和宣讲了毛主席的最新指示和以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的最新战斗号令。同时，又举办了十二万七千八百多期毛泽东思想学习班，参加学习的达三百三十二万多人。毛主席的最新指示和以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的最新战斗号令深入人心，家喻户晓，极大地提高了广大革命群众的阶级斗争觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟。
    二，一小撮阶级敌人受到了极其沉重的打击，无产阶级专政空前巩固。全区无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众联系本地区、本单位阶级斗争的实际，认真学习毛主席的“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续”的最新指示，不断加强对敌斗争，深入持久地开展革命大批判，向一小撮阶级敌人发动不停顿的猛烈的进攻，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派和其他反革命分子，取得了对敌斗争的伟大胜利。
    三，在开展“拥军爱民”运动和贯彻毛主席提出的“抓革命、促生产、促工作、促战备”的伟大方针方面，出现了一个崭新的局面。广大军民在阶级斗争的疾风暴雨中，并肩战斗，凝结了更加深厚的革命情谊，军爱民，民拥军，军民团结不断加强。农业生产在去年获得特大丰收之后，今年早稻又获丰收，广大城乡建立了革命的新秩序。
    中国人民解放军广西军区和驻军广大指战员，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决执行毛主席“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号令，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想宣传群众，武装群众，组织群众，同广大革命群众并肩战斗，在执行“三支”“两军”任务中，为广西无产阶级文化大革命作出了重大贡献。
