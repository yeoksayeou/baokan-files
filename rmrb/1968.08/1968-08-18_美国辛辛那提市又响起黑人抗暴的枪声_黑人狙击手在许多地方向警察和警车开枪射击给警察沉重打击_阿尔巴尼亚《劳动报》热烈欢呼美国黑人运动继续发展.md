		American black snipers fired at police and police cars from many locations, dealing a heavy blow to the police.

		The Albanian newspaper "Labor" enthusiastically cheers for the continued development of the American black movement.

		Xinhua News Agency, August 17th: Washington reports: In recent days, cities such as Cincinnati in Ohio and Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania have seen a series of new black protests against racial discrimination and for freedom and liberation, leaving the American reactionary ruling clique scrambling to defend itself and running around in circles.

		On the evening of the 16th, white racist elements brazenly murdered a black woman on the streets of Cincinnati, sparking immense outrage among local blacks. They took to the streets to protest this fascist atrocity and engaged in fierce battles with the fascist police who rushed to suppress them. The struggle quickly spread to many black neighborhoods in the city. Black crowds pelted the fascist police with bricks and bottles, leaving them in disarray. Armed black snipers fired at police and police cars from rooftops and other hiding spots across the city, dealing a heavy blow to the police.

		On the 15th, in Pittsburgh, a group of black youth bravely fought back against police who had provoked them without cause, injuring six police officers in the intense struggle and once again teaching the American reactionary ruling clique a lesson. On the morning of the 16th, in Petersburg, Florida, black youth bravely fought against fascist police amidst tear gas.

		Xinhua News Agency, Tirana: The Albanian newspaper "Labor" published an article on the 9th stating that class struggle within the United States is becoming increasingly sharp. Black workers and poor people are using revolutionary violence to resist imperialist violence, showing their deep anger towards the bloodthirsty capitalist system and the criminal policies of the Johnson administration.

		The article said that recent clashes between black people and the police, and the demonstrations in many American cities, are a continuation of the powerful black movement that erupted three months ago. Blacks are realizing that "peaceful protest" is not the path they should follow. Blacks are rising up with revolutionary violence against police violence, indicating that they are choosing the only correct path to fight for complete liberation, freedom, and rights, against racial discrimination, unemployment, hunger, and persecution.

		The article pointed out that class contradictions in the United States are deepening. The American black movement, combined with the movement of the entire American working class, will become a volcano ready to erupt, burying the Johnson regime. The increasingly intense struggle of American blacks is not only a struggle for freedom and liberation by the oppressed and exploited blacks but also a new call to all oppressed and exploited American people to fight against the savage rule of the monopoly capitalist class.

		The article said that American black workers are engaged in sharp class struggles with the ruling class for political and social rights, further raising the political awareness and organizational level of American blacks, making American blacks a force that the American imperialist ruling class increasingly fears.

    美国辛辛那提市又响起黑人抗暴的枪声
    黑人狙击手在许多地方向警察和警车开枪射击给警察沉重打击
    阿尔巴尼亚《劳动报》热烈欢呼美国黑人运动继续发展
    新华社十七日讯　华盛顿消息：美国俄亥俄州的辛辛那提、宾夕法尼亚州的匹兹堡等城市连日来又爆发了一系列新的黑人反对种族歧视，争取自由解放的抗暴斗争，使美国反动统治集团东西招架，疲于奔命。
    十六日晚，白人种族主义分子竟公然在辛辛那提市的大街上残酷地杀害了一名黑人妇女，激起了当地黑人的无限愤慨。他们纷纷走上大街抗议这种法西斯暴行，并和匆匆赶来镇压他们的法西斯警察展开激烈的斗争。接着，斗争迅速蔓延到这个市的许多黑人聚居区。黑人群众用大量的石块和瓶子打得法西斯警察狼狈不堪，带枪的黑人狙击手在全市许多地方从屋顶上和其他隐蔽处向警察和警车开枪射击，给了警察以沉重打击。
    十五日，在匹兹堡，一群黑人青年英勇地还击了向他们无故寻衅的警察，并在激烈的搏斗中，打伤了六名警察，又一次教训了美国反动统治集团。十六日晨，在佛罗里达州的彼得斯堡，黑人青年冒着催泪瓦斯同法西斯警察展开了英勇的搏斗。
    新华社地拉那电　阿尔巴尼亚《劳动报》九日发表文章指出，美国国内的阶级斗争越来越尖锐，黑人工人和穷苦人民用革命暴力抗击帝国主义暴力，表明他们对嗜血的资本主义制度和约翰逊政府的罪恶政策无比愤慨。
    文章说，最近美国黑人和广大劳动人民同警察的搏斗和在美国许多城市举行的示威游行，是三个月前爆发的强大的黑人运动的继续。黑人正在认识到“和平抗议”不是他们所应遵循的道路，黑人起来以革命的暴力对抗警察的暴力，说明他们正在选择一条争取彻底解放，争取自由和权利，反对种族歧视，反对失业，反对饥饿和反对迫害的唯一正确的道路。
    文章指出，美国的阶级矛盾日益深化。同整个美国工人阶级的运动相结合的美国黑人运动，将变成一座喷发的火山，它将埋葬约翰逊政权。日益高涨的美国黑人的斗争不仅是被压迫和被剥削的黑人为争取自由和解放的斗争，而且也是向全体被压迫和被剥削的美国人民发出的新的号召，号召他们同垄断资产阶级的野蛮统治展开斗争。
    文章说，美国黑人工人为争取政治和社会权利同统治集团进行尖锐的阶级搏斗，更加提高美国黑人的政治觉悟和组织程度，使美国黑人成为美帝国主义统治集团日益感到恐惧的一支力量。
