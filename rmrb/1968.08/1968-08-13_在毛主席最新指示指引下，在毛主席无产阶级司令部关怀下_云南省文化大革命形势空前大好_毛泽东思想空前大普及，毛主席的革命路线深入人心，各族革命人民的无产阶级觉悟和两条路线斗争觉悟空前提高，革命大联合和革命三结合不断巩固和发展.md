Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the care of Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters, the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Yunnan Province is extremely good and getting better every day. The main signs of this good situation are as follows: Mao Zedong Thought is being widely propagated, Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is deeply rooted in people's hearts, the class consciousness and the consciousness of the struggle between the two lines among the revolutionary people of all nationalities have been greatly heightened, and Chairman Mao's latest instructions are being implemented. The broad masses of revolutionary proletarians and revolutionary people closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, further consolidating and developing the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination. In the entire province, eleven autonomous prefectures (autonomous regions) and more than seventy counties and cities have achieved revolutionary great alliances or have reached agreements to achieve revolutionary great alliances. Two autonomous prefectures, two special administrative regions, and thirty-nine counties and cities have established revolutionary committees.

Over the past two years, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Yunnan Province has undergone a heart-rending struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines. In this struggle, the revolutionary proletarians and the broad revolutionary masses, under the wise leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, have launched fierce attacks on the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Yunnan, repeatedly repelling the ferocious counterattacks of a handful of class enemies, smashing their conspiracies to restore capitalism, and winning one great victory after another.

In the course of the struggle, the broad revolutionary masses have deeply felt that to follow Chairman Mao is to win victory, and to follow the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin is to win victory. By resolutely heeding Chairman Mao's words and acting according to his instructions, they have been invincible in the fierce class struggle. From the Wumeng Mountains to the Lancang River, from the banks of the Jinsha River to the banks of the Hong River, the movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought among the revolutionary people of all nationalities in the entire province is flourishing. In the process of learning, the broad revolutionary masses are promoting the revolutionary learning style advocated by Chairman Mao, which emphasizes theory linked with practice. The broad revolutionary workers, bringing with them the problems of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, are studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, arming themselves with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to strike at the class enemies and solve various problems in revolution and production. In many regions, the poor and lower-middle peasants read Chairman Mao's books before going to work, practice what they learn during production, and discuss their learning experiences after work. They have turned the process of production labor into the process of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and have turned the fields into classrooms for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. Along the thousand-mile border line and in the border villages where ethnic minorities reside, one can see everywhere the lively scenes of the broad revolutionary masses studying and applying Chairman Mao's works extensively.

The revolutionary people of all nationalities, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, are carrying out in-depth and sustained revolutionary great criticism, launching a total attack and settlement on the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Yunnan. The fire of revolutionary great criticism is burning more fiercely. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants have repeatedly criticized the "three autonomies and one contract," "four freedoms," "material incentives," and "work points as the commander" and other counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the countryside. They learn one of Chairman Mao's instructions, criticize one of the Chinese Khrushchev's fallacies, and eliminate one of his poisonous influences. The border ethnic peoples, using the great Mao Zedong Thought, have exposed, criticized, and struggled against the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies such as the "extinction of class struggle" and "border specialness" spread by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the border areas, greatly promoting the socialist revolution in the border areas. Through the revolutionary great criticism, the broad revolutionary masses have further heightened their class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness, promoting various works.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To hold study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes." The revolutionary people of all nationalities in the entire province, following Chairman Mao's teachings, are holding extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes, comprehensively implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes have sprung up like mushrooms after rain, covering the entire province's urban and rural areas. Now, the entire province has held more than 160,000 study classes of various types, with over 600 million participants. In the study classes, the broad revolutionary masses, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, fiercely criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev, fiercely struggle against the bourgeois "self," and firmly establish the proletarian "public." They are carrying out thorough ideological revolutionization. The broad revolutionary masses take the unconditional loyalty to Chairman Mao, unconditional loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and unconditional loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and the serious implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the standard for ideological revolutionization. The broad revolutionary masses, following the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings of "each making self-criticisms," "as long as both sides are revolutionary mass organizations, they should achieve revolutionary great alliance under revolutionary principles," and "believing in and relying on the majority of cadres," resolutely oppose right opportunism, right splitism, and right capitulationism, smash the right opportunist wind of reversal, fiercely criticize sectarianism, factionalism, and the bourgeois reactionary thought of "me as the core," firmly grasp the struggle against the enemy, root out a handful of traitors, spies, and unrepentant capitalist-roaders hiding behind the scenes and creating splits, help a large number of cadres come out to revolutionize, and promote the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination based on the principles of Mao Zedong Thought.

"People's revolution under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought is the locomotive of historical progress." The broad revolutionary people of the entire province are applying the boundless enthusiasm released in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to production, greatly promoting the development of industrial and agricultural production. At present, the situation of industrial and agricultural production in the entire province is extremely good. Agricultural production, based on the overall bumper harvest last year, has again achieved a bumper harvest of winter crops this year. The summer crops are also growing well, and a bumper harvest is in sight.

The broad officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Yunnan Province have resolutely responded to the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao to "support the broad leftist masses," holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, supporting the broad revolutionary masses with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought in the "three supports and two militaries" work, fighting shoulder to shoulder with the revolutionary proletarians and the revolutionary people of all nationalities. With their arduous and outstanding work, they have safeguarded the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Yunnan and achieved tremendous results. The broad officers and soldiers guarding the border of the motherland are vigilant and strengthening their preparedness with the revolutionary people of all nationalities, smashing the enemy's sabotage activities from the air and ground, and safeguarding the border of the motherland.

Now, the broad revolutionary proletarians and the revolutionary people of all nationalities in the entire province are determined, under the wise leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, to better follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, further develop the good situation, strive for the early establishment of the Yunnan Provincial Revolutionary Committee, and strive for the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

　　在毛主席最新指示指引下，在毛主席无产阶级司令部关怀下
　　云南省文化大革命形势空前大好
    毛泽东思想空前大普及，毛主席的革命路线深入人心，各族革命人民的无产阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟空前提高，革命大联合和革命三结合不断巩固和发展
    新华社昆明十二日电　在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的亲切关怀下，云南省无产阶级文化大革命形势空前大好，越来越好。形势大好的主要标志是，毛泽东思想空前大普及，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线空前深入人心，各族革命人民群众的无产阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟空前提高，毛主席的一系列最新指示进一步得到落实。广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，进一步巩固和发展了革命大联合和革命三结合。全省有十一个专区（自治州）和七十多个县、市实现了革命大联合或达成了实现革命大联合的协议，有两个专区、两个专辖州和三十九个县、市建立了革命委员会。
    两年多来，云南省的无产阶级文化大革命，经历了惊心动魄的两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的大搏斗。在这场斗争中，无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的英明领导下，向中国赫鲁晓夫及其在云南的代理人发动猛烈进攻，一次又一次地打退了一小撮阶级敌人的猖狂反扑，粉碎了他们复辟资本主义的阴谋，夺得了一个又一个的伟大胜利。
    在斗争实践中，广大革命群众更加深刻地体会到，紧跟毛主席就是胜利，紧跟以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部就是胜利。坚决听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，在激烈的阶级斗争中就能无往而不胜。从乌蒙山到澜沧江，从金沙江畔到红河两岸，全省各族革命人民活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动正在蓬勃发展。在学习中，广大革命群众大兴毛主席亲自倡导的理论联系实际的革命学风。广大革命工人，带着两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争中的问题，活学活用毛主席著作，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装自己，打击阶级敌人，解决革命和生产中的各种问题。许多地区的贫下中农，上工前读毛主席的书，生产中用行动来实践，收工后谈学习体会。他们把生产劳动的过程变成活学活用毛泽东思想的过程，把田间地头变成活学活用毛泽东思想的课堂。在千里边防线上，在少数民族聚居的边疆村寨，到处可以看到广大革命群众大学大用毛主席著作的生动情景。
    各族革命群众以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，深入持久地开展革命大批判，向中国赫鲁晓夫及其在云南的代理人展开了总攻击，总清算。革命大批判的烈火越烧越旺。广大贫下中农对中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在农村推行的“三自一包”、“四大自由”、“物质刺激”、“工分挂帅”等反革命修正主义黑货，进行了反复的批判。他们学习毛主席的一条指示，批判中国赫鲁晓夫的一个谬论，肃清他的一股流毒。边疆各族人民，运用伟大的毛泽东思想，对中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在边疆散布的“阶级斗争熄灭”论、“边疆特殊”论等反革命修正主义谬论，进行了大揭发，大批判，大斗争，大大推进了边疆的社会主义革命。通过革命的大批判，广大革命群众进一步提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，推动了各项工作。
    毛主席教导我们：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”全省各族革命群众，遵照毛主席的教导，大办毛泽东思想学习班，全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示。各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班如雨后春笋，遍及全省城乡各地。现在，全省已办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班十六万多期，参加学习的达六百多万人次。在学习班里，广大革命群众以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫所推行的反革命修正主义路线，狠斗资产阶级的“私”字，大立无产阶级的“公”字，大搞思想革命化。广大革命群众把无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，认真贯彻落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，作为思想革命化的标准。广大革命群众遵照伟大领袖毛主席的“各自多做自我批评”、“只要两派都是革命的群众组织，就要在革命的原则下实现革命的大联合”以及“相信和依靠干部的大多数”等教导，坚决反对右倾机会主义、右倾分裂主义、右倾投降主义，粉碎右倾翻案妖风，狠狠批判了宗派主义、山头主义和“以我为核心”等资产阶级反动思想，狠抓对敌斗争，挖出了一小撮躲在幕后制造分裂的叛徒、特务和死不改悔的走资派，帮助大批干部站出来革命，促进了在毛泽东思想原则基础上的革命大联合和革命三结合。
      “毛泽东思想指引下的人民革命是历史前进的火车头。”全省广大革命群众把在无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的冲天干劲用到生产上，极大地推动了工农业生产的发展。目前，全省工农业生产形势大好。农业生产在去年获得全面大丰收的基础上，今年又夺得了小春作物丰收。大春作物也长势良好，丰收在望。
    驻云南省人民解放军广大指战员，坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号召，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在“三支”“两军”工作中，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想支持广大革命群众，同无产阶级革命派和各族革命人民群众并肩战斗。他们以艰苦卓绝的工作，保卫了云南的无产阶级文化大革命，取得了巨大的成就。守卫在祖国边防线上的广大干部战士，同各族革命人民群众一起，百倍警惕，加强战备，粉碎了敌人来自空中和地面的破坏活动，保卫了祖国边疆。
    现在，全省广大无产阶级革命派和各族革命人民群众，决心在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的英明领导下，更好地紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，进一步发展大好形势，为早日建立云南省革命委员会，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利而努力奋斗。（附图片）
