The history of mankind is one of constantly advancing from the realm of necessity to the realm of freedom. This history will never end. As long as there are classes, class struggle will not end. Even in a classless society, the struggle between the new and the old, between right and wrong, will never end. In the realm of production struggle and scientific experimentation, mankind is constantly developing, and nature is constantly evolving, never stopping at a certain level. Therefore, mankind must constantly summarize experiences, make discoveries, inventions, and creations, and move forward.

The Great Development of Ordinary Low-Alloy Steel and the Bankruptcy of the "Chinese Khrushchev" Crawling Philosophy

The proletarian revolutionaries of the Ministry of Metallurgy

The working class on China's steel front, hoisting high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, with the revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win, has successfully explored the mysteries of various alloy elements in steel and achieved great victories in the development of ordinary low-alloy steel. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought and the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao. This victory eloquently proves the absolute correctness of Chairman Mao's teaching to "break conventions and adopt advanced technology as much as possible," and it declares the complete bankruptcy of the "Chinese Khrushchev" crawling philosophy.

From the Two-Line Struggle

For a long time, carbon steel has dominated the world's steel products. This has been seen as an unchangeable rule in the minds of many. However, China's socialist construction requires more and better steel, while China's steel industry is still very weak. This is a sharp contradiction. Should we follow the old path of others? Or should we rise up in revolution and forge our own path for the development of the steel industry?

In 1956, Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts in "On Ten Major Relationships" illuminated the path for China's own industrial development. Chairman Mao taught us to critically learn from foreign things, not to blindly copy and paste, to overthrow the mentality of servitude, and to bury dogmatism. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, Chinese steel workers decided to break free from foreign frameworks and forge their own path. After going through many twists and turns, in 1957, they successfully utilized China's own resources to create China's first type of ordinary low-alloy steel, igniting the torch of the steel product revolution. However, this new thing had just emerged when the agents of the "Chinese Khrushchev" in the metallurgical industry jumped out to oppose it, claiming it was "overambitious" and slandering the workers for "not even being able to copy foreign carbon steel, yet wanting to innovate." They set up numerous obstacles in experiments and production, attempting to strangle this new thing in its cradle.

However, the revolutionary fire cannot be extinguished. During the Great Leap Forward, steel workers followed Chairman Mao's great teaching of "breaking superstitions and liberating thoughts," hoisting high the banner of the "Anshan Constitution" personally formulated by Chairman Mao. They broke free from the shackles of the "Chinese Khrushchev" crawling philosophy, launching a mass movement to develop ordinary low-alloy steel, creating a large number of new types of ordinary low-alloy steel. The situation was excellent. In the face of the great technological revolution mass movement, the "Chinese Khrushchev" and his agents in the metallurgical industry were terrified, on one hand, shouting "overdone" and "overheated," putting on a fake foreigner's posture, raising the black flag of "establish first, then break," and not allowing the workers to revolutionize; on the other hand, they supported the reactionary "authorities" of the bourgeoisie to suppress the workers' revolution. In a certain steel plant, revolutionary workers dared to innovate, breaking free from foreign designs, comprehensively utilizing the symbiotic metals in the iron ore, and smelting a new type of corrosion-resistant low-alloy steel. In the eyes of a handful of capitalist roaders within the party, daring to touch the foreigners' heads was unthinkable. Thus, they immediately supported the reactionary "authorities" of the bourgeoisie to come out, using the so-called "vacuum refining" method, which is completely detached from reality, to try to eliminate this useful symbiotic metal, attempting to push the already smelted low-alloy steel back to the old path of carbon steel. Despite the demons and snakes causing trouble, steel workers firmly advanced along the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, achieving great successes in the field of ordinary low-alloy steel.

Chairman Mao issued a great call for a "design revolution" on the industrial and transportation fronts, greatly encouraging steel workers to march towards the magnificent goal of catching up with and surpassing the world's advanced scientific and technological level. Machines must be revolutionized, buildings must be revolutionized, and first of all, steel products must be revolutionized. Ordinary low-alloy steel is much better than carbon steel: using it to make machines, they are small and exquisite; using it to build factories, the structures are light and elegant; using it to lay railways, they are strong and durable; using it to make cars, they can carry more and run faster. The design revolution greatly promoted the revolution of steel products, launching a large-scale cooperation in production, use, and scientific research, expanding the scope of using China's unique resources, and creating rich and diverse new varieties, which were promoted and used in the main departments of the national economy. The great development of ordinary low-alloy steel has become an irresistible trend. At this time, the "Chinese Khrushchev" and his agents in the metallurgical industry again raised the flag of the crawling philosophy, claiming, "The Americans haven't developed these things, what use is it for you to develop so many?" Even more viciously, they tried to cut off the source by not producing alloy raw materials, attempting to strangle the development of ordinary low-alloy steel.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution roared like thunder, completely destroying the headquarters of the bourgeoisie led by the "Chinese Khrushchev." Mao Zedong Thought has deeply penetrated the hearts of the people. Mao Zedong Thought, once grasped by the broad masses, becomes an inexhaustible force, becoming an atomic bomb of tremendous power. The creativity of steel workers burst forth, performing wonders on the battlefield of ordinary low-alloy steel. However, a handful of capitalist roaders within the party and reactionary "authorities" of the bourgeoisie were still struggling to the end, continuing to make trouble. They claimed, "You can't spread it out, you have to have a scientific attitude," and "You are messing around, and we can't even clean up the mess." At the same time, they also created numerous obstacles in production and experiments. Steel workers fought back against them, seizing power from a handful of capitalist roaders within the party, removing obstacles, seizing the revolution, promoting production, and insisting on large-scale experiments and production of ordinary low-alloy steel. Steel workers, with the attitude of masters, further occupied the stage of science and technology. With boundless love for Chairman Mao and deep hatred for the "Chinese Khrushchev," they fiercely criticized the reactionary revisionist technological line, denounced the crawling philosophy, broke free from foreign frameworks and dogmas; with workers as the main force, combining workers, technical personnel, and cadres, they formed a vast army of product revolution, charging towards the battlefield of the steel product revolution. Steel workers regarded every smelting of a new type of steel and every production of a ton of low-alloy steel as a battle to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, as a cannon shot towards the "Chinese Khrushchev." They proudly named the steel they smelted as "Steel of Pride," "Anti-Revisionist Steel," and "Revolutionary Steel."

Chairman Mao taught us: "Revolution is the liberation of productive forces, revolution is the promotion of the development of productive forces." Under the impetus of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, ordinary low-alloy steel developed rapidly. Large factories produced it, and small factories also produced it; production units produced it, and usage units also produced it. The production level of ordinary low-alloy steel in the two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution increased twentyfold compared to before the Cultural Revolution; the new types of steel tested in these two years increased tenfold compared to the total of the previous nine years. Moreover, most of these types of steel were independently created by China, with many being types of steel that foreigners had never touched, or even thought they couldn't touch. China's bridge steel, power station steel, car beam steel, coal mining machine chain steel, high-strength steel bars, and plowshare steel, etc., all used new varieties that surpassed the world's advanced level. Currently, the ten-thousand-ton giant ships sailing in the vast sea, the heavy trucks roaming the vast land of the motherland, the agricultural machinery busy in the fields, as well as the newly built railways, mines, factories, and bridges, have all been armed with ordinary low-alloy steel created by the hands of Chinese workers.

Break Free from Foreign Frameworks, Forge Our Own Path

The great leader Chairman Mao taught us that we must have the great aspirations and ambitions of the proletariat, daring to walk paths that others have not walked, daring to climb peaks that others have not climbed. Chairman Mao, with the great spirit of the proletarian genius teacher, pointed out the broad and smooth road for us to develop science and technology quickly, efficiently, and economically.

The crawling philosophy advocated by the "Chinese Khrushchev" and his ilk is fundamentally opposed to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They kneel before imperialism and revisionism, shouting, "They do high and fast, we do low and slow." The agents of the "Chinese Khrushchev" in the metallurgical industry also slandered the workers' creation of ordinary low-alloy steel as "overambitious," shouting, "We can only imitate, we cannot innovate."

What "they do high and fast, we do low and slow"! What "overambitious"! In the eyes of the "Chinese Khrushchev" and his ilk, it seems that foreigners are always more brilliant than us, we are not as good as foreigners, and even the moon in foreign countries is rounder than in China. This is truly the attitude of a slave, the most pitiful and spineless person. The industrious and brave Chinese nation has made great contributions to world civilization over thousands of years of history. In the short span of a dozen years since the founding of New China, China's science and technology have leaped forward at an unprecedented speed. The atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs that foreigners have been working on for a long time and boasting about, we have not only caught up with but surpassed in a shorter time. The artificial synthesis of insulin that foreigners have been working on for many years without success, we have created first. The industrial synthetic benzene that foreigners still do not have, we have built the world's first synthetic benzene workshop. Just take ordinary low-alloy steel as an example, foreigners have been working on it for nearly half a century without making much progress, and we have surpassed them in a short time.

Countless facts show that we can catch up with and surpass the world's advanced scientific and technological level. The fundamental reason is that we have the wise leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and the superior socialist system. Chairman Mao is the greatest revolutionary teacher of our time, the greatest genius in the world, Mao Zedong Thought is the highest truth of the proletariat, and it is the most powerful weapon of thought in production struggle and scientific experimentation. Using Mao Zedong Thought to guide science and technology, we can break through all obstacles and create miracles. Our socialist system, like the rising sun in the east, is magnificent to the world, opening up a vast horizon for the development of science and technology. While the capitalist system is setting, gasping for breath, it has become a shackle for the development of productive forces. What the Western bourgeoisie dares not think of, we dare to think of. What the Western bourgeoisie cannot do, we can do. We must be "overambitious," aiming high for socialism and far for communism.

In the dictionary of the "Chinese Khrushchev" and his ilk's crawling philosophy, everything is headed by "foreign." They not only elevate foreigners to the heavens but also treat foreign books as the "Bible," as unchanging "truths," using them to shackle the hands and feet of workers and suppress workers' creativity. In fact, what are foreign books and theories? They are nothing special. Chairman Mao taught us: "Correct ideas can only come from social practice, only from the three kinds of social practice: production struggle, class struggle, and scientific experimentation." Books are written by people, and all useful book knowledge is a summary of practice. The laboring people's creations. We do not reject learning from the strengths of foreigners, but we must learn critically, taking the essence and discarding the dregs, making the past serve the present and foreigners serve China. Books and theories are constantly developing with practice. Chinese steel workers follow Chairman Mao's teaching of "having discoveries, inventions, creations, and progress," not being slaves to foreign theories, but daring to practice, constantly summarizing, and daring to innovate. What is in the books, they can improve and develop based on new practices; what is not in the books, they can write new chapters based on new practices.

The innovations of steel workers in the field of ordinary low-alloy steel have broken free from the shackles of bourgeois metaphysics, developing new alloy steel theories. For example, in ordinary low-alloy steel, there are several elements that foreign books have always regarded as harmful and useless, so they try every means to remove them. In the eyes of reactionary "authorities" of the bourgeoisie, this has become a settled conclusion. Chinese steel workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought do not believe in this foreign theory. They use the dialectical materialist way of thinking, seeing not only the harmful side of these elements but also their beneficial side. Through extensive and in-depth experimental research, practicing, recognizing, practicing again, and recognizing again, they finally understood their nature, overcame and controlled their weaknesses, utilized and promoted their advantages, found the boundary and conditions for turning harm into benefit, achieving the transformation from harm to benefit, creating new types of steel, and developing new theories.

Surrendering to imperialism, revisionism, and reaction, crawling behind foreigners, and living off foreign books is a dead end. Only by breaking free from foreign frameworks and forging our own path can science and technology have a bright future.

The Working Class is the Master

Is the technological revolution dependent on the broad masses of workers, launching a mass movement, or dependent on a few reactionary "authorities" of the bourgeoisie, doing it coldly and quietly? This is a fundamental difference between Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the "Chinese Khrushchev's" counter-revolutionary revisionist line, a fundamental difference between forging our own path of industrial development and the crawling philosophy.

The great leader Chairman Mao has always taught us: "The masses are the real heroes." He recently pointed out with great wisdom: "Our country has 700 million people. The working class is the leading class. We must fully play the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and all work." In carrying out the technological revolution, we must believe in the masses, rely on the masses, respect the masses' pioneering spirit; we must mobilize the masses, launch a mass movement; we must make the masses of workers truly the masters of science and technology.

The "Chinese Khrushchev" and his ilk have always pushed the "expert line," advocating "expert management," aiming to let the reactionary "authorities" of the bourgeoisie monopolize the power of science and technology, suppressing the workers' politics. They claimed, "We must especially rely on managers, engineers, and technicians," even crazily shouting, "Without utilizing the bourgeois intellectuals, it is impossible to build socialism." In their minds, only a few reactionary "authorities" of the bourgeoisie who have eaten foreign bread, drunk foreign ink, and served as foreign slaves can be the main actors of science and technology, while the masses of workers are just extras, "Liu Bei," and "mob." The agents of the "Chinese Khrushchev" in the metallurgical industry also handed over the leadership of ordinary low-alloy steel to a few reactionary "authorities" of the bourgeoisie, claiming, "We cannot let young people mess around." In fact, what are these few reactionary "authorities" of the bourgeoisie? Politically, they are the remnants of the Kuomintang; technically, they are ignorant and incompetent. Without foreign crutches, they cannot take a step; they daydream in their offices, creating fantasies, and building cars in closed doors. They are engaged in the work of sabotaging socialist construction and dreaming of restoring capitalism.

For many years, the "Chinese Khrushchev" has vigorously promoted the "expert line" in science and technology, excluding the true masters, the broad masses of workers. This historical inversion must be inverted again.

Chairman Mao taught us: "The humble are the wisest! The noble are the most foolish." The broad masses of workers have deep proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao and the Party. On the road to advancing science and technology, they do not seek fame or wealth, fearing neither heaven nor earth, neither death nor foreigners, full of vitality, daring to think and act. They are the "most experienced warriors," the main force directly participating in the three great revolutionary movements. However, due to the suppression of a handful of capitalist roaders within the party and the reactionary "authorities" of the bourgeoisie, their rich creativity has not been fully liberated. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution roared like cannon fire, overthrowing the bourgeois lords riding on their heads, breaking the nets that bound them, and their wisdom and talent burst forth. Many inventions and creations of ordinary low-alloy steel were made by those steel workers who were once regarded as "humble."

There is a new type of ordinary low-alloy steel independently created by China, which is smelted by comprehensively utilizing the symbiotic metals in iron ore. This topic was researched by the reactionary "authorities" of the bourgeoisie for four or five years without any results. Steel workers achieved the breakthrough in technical difficulties in less than half a year. This incident is very revealing.

In a certain iron mine, there is a special metal that is an important element for making alloy steel. However, a handful of capitalist roaders within the party in the metallurgical industry, under the pretext that it is difficult to refine this metal and that foreigners do not have mature experience, delayed it for several years, long refusing to comprehensively utilize it. Under the accusation and opposition of the broad revolutionary masses, they were forced in 1963 to find a so-called "steel expert" to research it. This reactionary fellow, after receiving the research task, put on airs, played tricks, and boasted that this was an advanced topic in international science and technology, which must be approached from deep theories. He spent all day in the library, looking up foreign books, locking himself in the laboratory, scratching his head and ears, lost in thought. He also went to the site a few times, had workers take a few samples, but acted mysteriously, not letting the workers know what he was up to. Thus, he spent a few years, from the library to the laboratory, from formulas to theories, publishing many pompous "papers," but he had no idea how to actually refine and utilize this metal.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began, and steel workers, with a high sense of responsibility as masters, angrily criticized the "crawling philosophy" and "expert management" and other counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies. They said proudly: "The capitalist roaders waste precious resources, we firmly do not agree. The 'experts' and 'authorities' cannot do it, we will do it ourselves. We must take it back and serve socialist construction." They said and did, utilizing existing equipment, making do with what they had, working day and night, daring to experiment. At this time, the capitalist roaders came out to obstruct, "one stab, two pressures, three inducements." They ridiculed the workers as "frogs wanting to eat swans," used "experiments cannot affect production" to apply pressure, and used "failing to complete the task means no bonus" to threaten and induce. The workers did not pay any attention to this, stubbornly pushing forward. After achieving initial results, the capitalist roaders again used the excuse of high cost, claiming that it was a losing business, attempting to make the experiment fail midway. However, the workers were not intimidated. They repeatedly studied the works of Chairman Mao, drawing infinite strength from them. They remembered Chairman Mao's teaching that "the growth of any new thing is bound to be full of twists and turns," determined to sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory. After seizing power, they, with sky-high enthusiasm and fearless revolutionary spirit, actively combined with revolutionary technical personnel and revolutionary cadres, launching a more intense attack on this technological fortress, finally breaking through one difficulty after another, creating a complete set of new smelting methods, not only greatly reducing the cost and recovering the precious metal but also using it to smelt new types of ordinary low-alloy steel. This set of new smelting methods and new types of steel are unprecedented abroad. The proletarian revolutionaries were elated, and the reactionary "authorities" of the bourgeoisie were dumbfounded, greatly boosting the morale of the proletariat and greatly demoralizing the bourgeoisie.

Who is the master of the technological revolution? This is not very clear?

Relying on the reactionary "authorities" of the bourgeoisie, doing it coldly and quietly, can only result in a miserable and pitiful crawling. Only when the workers become the masters of science and technology, doing it vigorously and vigorously, can they create miracles that the bourgeoisie cannot imagine.

The Great Victory of Mao Zedong Thought

Comrade Lin Biao said: "All our achievements and victories are achieved under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and are the victories of Mao Zedong Thought." "Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all work of the entire Party, the entire army, and the entire country."

Mao Zedong Thought is the science of proletarian revolution and the most powerful weapon of thought for the proletariat to recognize and transform nature. The reason why Chinese steel workers can occupy the new field of ordinary low-alloy steel, climb the new peak of world science and technology, and forge a new path for the rapid, efficient, and economical development of steel products is fundamentally because they have grasped the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

It is the brilliant thoughts of Chairman Mao's "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" that have armed the steel workers, breaking free from the shackles of bourgeois metaphysics, daring to practice, good at summarizing, and creatively developing the theory of alloy steel, writing a new glorious page in the history of steel development.

It is the great teaching of Chairman Mao to "break superstitions and liberate thoughts" that has guided the steel workers to jump out of the old tradition of steel products, challenging the dominant position of carbon steel, taking the first step in the revolution of steel products, and embarking on the great development of ordinary low-alloy steel.

It is the great teaching of Chairman Mao to "catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level" that has inspired the steel workers to break free from the crawling philosophy, despise foreigners and foreign books, daring to innovate in the field of ordinary low-alloy steel, creating new types of steel, climbing new peaks, and far surpassing the Western bourgeoisie.

It is the great teaching of Chairman Mao to launch mass movements that has liberated the boundless creativity of steel workers, destroying the "expert line," and achieving brilliant results in the great battle of developing ordinary low-alloy steel.

It is the great teaching of Chairman Mao that "all revolutionary struggles in the world are for seizing power and consolidating power" that has awakened the steel workers to overthrow the rule of a handful of capitalist roaders within the party and the reactionary "authorities" of the bourgeoisie, seizing back the power of science and technology, firmly grasping it in their own hands, truly becoming the masters of the technological revolution.

The great development of ordinary low-alloy steel is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought and the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, unite under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. In the new high tide of seizing the revolution and promoting production, in the new high tide of "seriously carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation," let us ride the wind and break the waves, singing and advancing, pushing the revolution of steel products to a new stage.

    人类的历史，就是一个不断地从必然王国向自由王国发展的历史。这个历史永远不会完结。在有阶级存在的社会内，阶级斗争不会完结。在无阶级存在的社会内，新与旧、正确与错误之间的斗争永远不会完结。在生产斗争和科学实验范围内，人类总是不断发展的，自然界也总是不断发展的，永远不会停止在一个水平上。因此，人类总得不断地总结经验，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进。
    普通低合金钢的巨大发展和中国赫鲁晓夫爬行哲学的破产
    冶金部机关无产阶级革命派
    我国钢铁战线上的工人阶级，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以敢于斗争、敢于胜利的无产阶级革命精神，成功地探索了钢里各种合金元素的奥秘，取得了普通低合金钢巨大发展的胜利。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的胜利。这一胜利雄辩地证明了毛主席“我们必须打破常规，尽量采用先进技术”的教导无比英明，宣告了中国赫鲁晓夫爬行哲学的彻底破产。
      从两条路线斗争中冲杀出来
    长期以来，碳素钢在世界钢铁产品中占统治地位。这一点，在许多人心目中，是一条不可改变的规律。但是，我国社会主义建设需要更多更好的钢铁，而我国钢铁工业的基础还很薄弱，这是一个尖锐的矛盾。是沿着别人的老路走呢？还是起来革命，走自己钢铁工业发展的道路呢？
    一九五六年，毛主席《论十大关系》的光辉思想照亮了我国自己工业发展的道路。毛主席教导我们，对外国的东西，要批判地学，不要照抄照搬，要打倒奴隶思想，埋葬教条主义。我国钢铁工人在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，决心打破洋框框，走自己的路。经历艰难曲折，在一九五七年成功地利用了我国自己的资源，创造了我国第一个普通低合金钢种，点燃了钢铁产品革命的火炬。但是，这个新生事物刚刚出现，中国赫鲁晓夫在冶金工业系统的代理人就跳出来反对，胡说这是“好高骛远”，污蔑工人“抄外国的碳素钢还过不了关，还想什么独创。”他们在试验和生产上，设置重重障碍，妄图把这一新生事物扼杀在摇篮里。
    但是，革命烈火是扑灭不了的。在大跃进的年代里，钢铁工人遵循毛主席“破除迷信，解放思想”的伟大教导，高举毛主席亲自制定的“鞍钢宪法”的旗帜，冲破中国赫鲁晓夫爬行哲学的束缚，兴起一了大搞普通低合金钢的群众运动，创造了一大批普通低合金钢的新钢种，形势一片大好。在伟大的技术革命的群众运动面前，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在冶金工业系统的代理人吓破了胆，一面大叫大嚷“破过了头”、“头脑发热”，摆出一副假洋鬼子的架势，扯起“先立后破”的黑旗，不准工人革命；一面抬出资产阶级反动“权威”，镇压工人革命。某钢厂革命工人大胆创新，突破洋设计的框框，综合利用铁矿里共生的金属，炼出了新型的耐腐蚀的低合金钢。在党内一小撮走资派看来，敢在洋人头上动土，这还了得。于是，他们就马上支持资产阶级反动“权威”出来，用完全脱离实际的所谓“真空提炼”的办法，硬要搞掉这种有用的共生金属，妄图把已经炼出来的低合金钢打回去，走碳素钢的老路。尽管这些牛鬼蛇神兴风作浪，钢铁工人仍然坚定地沿着毛主席指引的方向奋勇前进，在普通低合金钢领域里取得了很大的成绩。
    毛主席向工业交通战线发出了“设计革命”的伟大号召，大大鼓舞了钢铁工人向赶超世界先进科学技术水平的宏伟目标进军。机器要革命，建筑要革命，首先要求钢铁产品革命。普通低合金钢比碳素钢好得多：用它造机器，小巧玲珑；用它盖厂房，结构轻巧；用它铺铁路，坚固耐用；用它做汽车，多装快运。设计革命大大推动了钢铁产品革命，开展了生产、使用和科研的大协作，扩大了使用我国独特资源的范围，创造了丰富多采的新品种，在国民经济主要部门推广使用。普通低合金钢的巨大发展，已经是大势所趋，不可阻挡。这个时候，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在冶金工业系统的代理人，又扯起了爬行哲学的破旗，胡说什么“美国也没有发展这些玩意儿，你们搞这么多有什么用！”更加恶毒的是他们来个釜底抽薪，不搞合金原料，妄图扼杀普通低合金钢的发展。
    无产阶级文化大革命一声春雷，以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部被彻底摧毁了。毛泽东思想普遍深入人心。毛泽东思想为广大群众所掌握，就变成了无穷无尽的力量，变成威力无比的精神原子弹。钢铁工人的创造性爆发出来了，在普通低合金钢的战场上大显神通。但是，党内一小撮走资派和资产阶级反动“权威”还在进行垂死挣扎，继续捣乱。他们胡说什么“不能铺开搞，要有科学态度”，“你们乱搞，我们擦屁股也擦不完”。同时，他们还在生产试验中百般进行刁难。钢铁工人与他们进行了针锋相对的斗争，夺了党内一小撮走资派的权，排除了障碍，抓革命，促生产，坚持了普通低合金钢的大试验、大生产。钢铁工人以主人翁的姿态进一步占领了科学技术舞台，他们怀着对毛主席的无限热爱，对中国赫鲁晓夫的刻骨仇恨，狠批反革命修正主义科技路线，痛斥爬行哲学，大破洋框框、洋教条；以工人为主，工人、技术人员和干部三结合，组成了一支浩浩荡荡的产品革命大军，杀向钢铁产品革命的战场。钢铁工人把每炼成一个新钢种，每生产一吨低合金钢，当作捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的战斗，当作射向中国赫鲁晓夫的炮弹。他们把炼出来的钢，自豪地命名为“争气钢”、“反修钢”、“革命钢”。
    毛主席教导我们：“革命就是解放生产力，革命就是促进生产力的发展”。在无产阶级文化大革命的推动下，普通低合金钢得到迅猛异常的发展。大厂搞，小厂也搞；生产单位搞，使用单位也搞。普通低合金钢在无产阶级文化大革命两年内达到的生产水平，比文化大革命以前猛增二十倍；普通低合金钢在这两年内试制的新钢种，比以往九年的总和增加十倍。而且，其中绝大部分钢种是我国独创的，有许多是外国从来没有碰过的、甚至认为是碰不得的钢种。我国的大桥用钢，电站用钢，汽车大梁用钢，采煤机链条用钢，高强度钢筋及犁铧用钢等，都用上了超过世界先进水平的新品种。目前，远航在大海中的万吨巨轮，驰骋在祖国大地上的重型汽车，奔忙在田野里的农业机器，以及新建的铁路、矿井、工厂和桥梁，……已经用我国工人双手创造的普通低合金钢武装起来了。
        打破洋框框，走自己的路
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们，我们一定要有无产阶级的雄心壮志，敢于走前人没有走过的道路，敢于攀登前人没有攀登过的高峰。毛主席以无产阶级天才导师的伟大气魄，为我们指明了多快好省地发展科学技术的康庄大道。
    中国赫鲁晓夫之流一贯鼓吹的跟在洋人屁股后面爬行的道路，是同毛主席的无产阶级革命路线根本对立的。他们拜倒在帝国主义、修正主义脚下，叫嚷：“人家搞高的、快的，我们就暂时搞低的、慢的。”中国赫鲁晓夫在冶金工业系统的代理人也污蔑工人创造普通低合金钢，是“好高骛远”，叫嚣“只能仿制，不能独创”。
    什么“人家搞高的”，我们“搞低的”！什么“好高骛远”！在中国赫鲁晓夫之流的眼里，仿佛洋人总比我们高明，我们不如洋人，甚至外国的月亮也比中国的圆。这真是十足的奴才相，最没有出息的可怜虫。勤劳勇敢的中华民族，在几千年的悠久历史中，对世界文明作出了伟大的贡献。在新中国成立以后的短短十几年内，我国科学技术以空前的速度向前跃进。洋人搞了很久、吹得很响的原子弹、氢弹，我们不是后来居上，用更短的时间搞出来了吗？洋人搞了多少年没有搞出来的人工合成胰岛素，我们不是首先创造出来了吗？洋人至今没有工业上的合成苯，我们不是建成世界上第一个合成苯车间了吗？就拿普通低合金钢来说，洋人搞了将近半个世纪，也没有打开什么局面，我们不是在短短的时间里，就把他们甩在后面了吗？
    无数事实说明，我们完全能够赶上和超过世界先进的科学技术水平。最根本的原因是我们有伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导，有战无不胜的毛泽东思想，有无比优越的社会主义制度。毛主席是当代最伟大的革命导师，是世界最伟大的天才，毛泽东思想是无产阶级的最高真理，是生产斗争、科学实验的最强大的思想武器。用毛泽东思想统帅科学技术，就能势如破竹，所向披靡，创造世界奇迹。我们的社会主义制度，犹如东方刚刚升起的太阳，磅礴于全世界，为科学技术的发展开辟了广阔的天地。而资本主义制度则是日薄西山，气息奄奄，它已成为生产力发展的桎梏。西方资产阶级不敢想的，我们敢想。西方资产阶级办不到的，我们能办到。我们就是要“好高骛远”，好社会主义之高，骛共产主义之远。
    在中国赫鲁晓夫之流的爬行哲学的字典里，处处都是“洋”字当头。他们不仅把洋人捧上了天，而且把洋本本奉为“圣经”，当做万古不变的“真理”，用来束缚工人手脚，压制工人创造。其实什么洋本本、洋理论，根本没有什么了不起。毛主席教导我们：“人的正确思想，只能从社会实践中来，只能从社会的生产斗争、阶级斗争和科学实验这三项实践中来。”书都是人写的，一切有用的书本知识都是实践的总结，劳动人民的创造。我们并不排斥学习外国的长处，但要批判地学，取其精华，去其糟粕，古为今用，洋为中用。本本、理论都是随着实践而不断发展的。我国钢铁工人遵循毛主席“有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进”的教导，不做洋理论的奴隶，而是勇于实践，不断总结，敢于创新。书本上有的，他们能够根据新的实践加以提高和发展；书本上没有的，他们能够根据新的实践写出新的篇章。
    钢铁工人在普通低合金钢领域中的创新，就打破了资产阶级形而上学的束缚，发展了新的合金钢理论。例如，普通低合金钢里面有几种元素，洋本本上历来把它们当做有害无益的坏东西，所以千方百计要把它们去掉，这在资产阶级反动“权威”看来，已成定论。用毛泽东思想武装起来的我国钢铁工人，就不迷信这个洋理论。他们运用唯物辩证法的思想，既看到这些元素有害的一面，又看到它们有利的一面。通过广泛、深入的试验研究，实践、认识、再实践、再认识，终于摸透了它们的脾气，克服、制约它们的弱点，利用、发扬它们的优点，找出由害转化为利的界限和条件，实现了变害为利，创造出新的钢种，发展了新理论。
    屈服于帝、修、反，跟在洋人后面爬行，从洋本本里讨生活，是没有出路的。只有打破洋框框，走自己的路，科学技术发展才有光辉灿烂的前途。
        工　人　阶　级　是　主　人
    技术革命是依靠广大工人群众，大搞群众运动，还是依靠少数资产阶级反动“权威”，冷冷清清地搞？是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线和中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线的一个根本区别，是走自己工业发展的道路和爬行哲学的一个根本区别。
    伟大领袖毛主席一贯教导我们：“群众是真正的英雄”。他老人家最近又英明地指出：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。”我们搞技术革命，就是要相信群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神；就是要放手发动群众，大搞群众运动；就是要使工人群众真正成为科学技术的主人。
    中国赫鲁晓夫之流一贯推行“专家路线”，鼓吹“专家治厂”，就是要让资产阶级反动“权威”垄断科学技术大权，专工人群众的政。他们胡说什么：“特别要依靠厂长、工程师、技师”，甚至疯狂叫嚣：“不利用资产阶级知识分子，要想建设社会主义是不可能的。”在他们心目中，只有吃过洋面包、喝饱洋墨水、当惯洋奴才的少数资产阶级反动“权威”，才是科学技术的主角，而工人群众只是陪衬，是“阿斗”，是“群氓”。中国赫鲁晓夫在冶金工业系统的代理人，也把普通低合金钢的领导大权，拱手交给少数资产阶级反动“权威”，胡说什么：“不能让青年人毛手毛脚乱搞。”其实这一小撮资产阶级反动“权威”，尽是些什么货色呢？在政治上，他们是国民党的残渣余孽；在技术上，他们是不学无术的大草包。他们离开了洋拐棍就寸步难行，他们成天钻在办公室里，异想天开，闭门造车。他们干的是破坏社会主义建设的勾当，做的是复辟资本主义的迷梦。
    多少年来，中国赫鲁晓夫在科学技术方面极力推行“专家路线”，把真正的主人广大工人群众排斥在门外。这种历史的颠倒，一定要再颠倒过来。
    毛主席教导我们：“卑贱者最聪明！高贵者最愚蠢。”广大工人群众对毛主席、对党有着深厚的无产阶级感情。他们在向科学技术进军的道路上，不为名，不为利，天不怕，地不怕，死人不怕，洋人不怕，朝气蓬勃，敢想敢干。他们是“最有实践经验的战士”，是直接参加三大革命运动的主力军。但是，由于党内一小撮走资派和资产阶级的反动“权威”的压制，他们丰富的创造力没有完全解放出来。无产阶级文化大革命一声炮响，打倒了骑在他们头上的资产阶级老爷，冲决了束缚他们的罗网，他们的聪明才智迸发出来了。普通低合金钢的许多发明创造，正是那些从前被看做“卑贱者”的钢铁工人闯出来的。
    有一种我国独创的新型普通低合金钢，是综合利用铁矿石中的共生金属炼出来的。这个课题，资产阶级反动“权威”搞了四、五年，一事无成。钢铁工人搞了不到半年，就攻克了技术难关。这件事很能说明问题。
    某铁矿里面含有一种特殊金属，是搞合金钢的重要元素。但是，冶金工业系统的党内一小撮走资派，却借口提炼这种金属很难，外国也没有成熟经验，所以一拖几年，长期不去综合利用。在广大革命群众的指责和反对下，到一九六三年才被迫找了一个所谓“炼钢专家”去研究。这个反动家伙接到研究任务以后，摆开架子，故弄玄虚，扬言这是国际科学技术上的一个尖端，必须从高深理论入手。他成天跑图书馆，查洋本本，关在试验室里搔头摸耳，冥思苦想。他也到现场兜过几个圈子，叫工人取过几个样品，却装得神乎其神，根本不让工人知道他葫芦里卖的什么药。就这样悠悠晃晃，过了几年，从图书馆到实验室，从公式到理论，冠冕堂皇的“论文”发表了不少，但是实际怎样提炼和利用这种金属，却一点名堂也没有搞出来。
    无产阶级文化大革命开始了，钢铁工人以高度主人翁的责任感，愤怒批判了“爬行哲学”和“专家治厂”等反革命修正主义谬论。他们豪迈地说：“走资派把宝贵的资源白白扔掉，我们坚决不答应。‘专家’‘权威’搞不出来，我们自己搞。一定要把它拿回来，为社会主义建设服务。”他们说干就干，利用现有设备，因陋就简，夜以继日，大胆试验。这个时候，走资派就出来阻挠，“一刺、二压、三利诱”。他们讽刺工人是“癞蛤蟆想吃天鹅肉”，又是用“试验不能影响生产”来施加压力，又是用“完不成任务不发奖金”来进行威胁利诱。工人根本不理这一套，硬着头皮顶下去。在取得了初步成果以后，走资派又借口成本太高，赔本生意不干，妄图使试验中途夭折。但是，工人并没有被吓倒。他们反复学习毛主席著作，从中吸取了无穷的力量。他们牢记毛主席“任何新生事物的成长都是要经过艰难曲折的”教导，下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。夺权以后，他们以冲天的干劲和大无畏的革命精神，主动和革命技术人员、革命干部结合，向这个技术堡垒作更猛烈的进攻，终于突破一个又一个的难关，创造出一整套新的冶炼方法，不仅大大降低了成本，回收了宝贵的金属，还用它炼出了新型的普通低合金钢。这套新的冶炼方法和新的钢种，都是国外从来没有的。无产阶级革命派扬眉吐气，资产阶级反动“权威”目瞪口呆，大长了无产阶级志气，大灭了资产阶级威风。
    究竟谁是技术革命的主人，这不是十分清楚了吗？依靠资产阶级反动“权威”，冷冷清清地搞，只能凄凄惨惨、悲悲戚戚地爬行。只有工人当了科学技术的主人，轰轰烈烈地搞，才能创造出资产阶级庸人所意想不到的奇迹。
      毛泽东思想的伟大胜利
    林彪副主席说：“我们的一切成就，一切胜利，都是在毛主席的英明领导下取得的，都是毛泽东思想的胜利。”“毛泽东思想是全党、全军和全国一切工作的指导方针。”
    毛泽东思想是无产阶级革命的科学，又是无产阶级认识自然、改造自然的最强大的思想武器。我国钢铁工人所以能够占领普通低合金钢的新领域，攀登世界科学技术的新高峰，闯出一条多快好省地发展钢铁产品的新道路，最根本的就是因为他们掌握了战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    是伟大领袖毛主席《实践论》、《矛盾论》的光辉思想，武装了钢铁工人，冲破资产阶级形而上学的束缚，勇于实践，善于总结，创造性地发展了合金钢理论，在钢铁发展史上写下了新的光辉的一页。
    是伟大领袖毛主席“破除迷信，解放思想”的伟大教导，指引钢铁工人跳出钢铁产品老传统的圈子，向碳素钢的统治地位挑战，迈开了钢铁产品革命的第一步，踏上了普通低合金钢的巨大发展的征途。
    是伟大领袖毛主席“赶上和超过世界先进水平”的伟大教导，鼓舞钢铁工人大破爬行哲学，藐视洋人、洋本本，敢于在普通低合金钢领域里标新立异，独创新钢种，攀登新高峰，把西方资产阶级远远甩在后面。
    是伟大领袖毛主席大搞群众运动的伟大教导，解放了钢铁工人蕴藏着的无限创造力，摧毁了“专家路线”，在大搞普通低合金钢的战斗中，取得辉煌战果。
    是伟大领袖毛主席“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权”的伟大教导，唤起钢铁工人推翻党内一小撮走资派和资产阶级反动“权威”的统治，把科学技术大权夺回来，牢牢掌握在自己的手里，真正成了技术革命的主人。
    普通低合金钢的巨大发展，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。
    让我们更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部领导下团结起来，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。在抓革命，促生产的新高潮中，在“认真搞好斗、批、改”的新高潮中，乘风破浪，高歌猛进，把钢铁产品革命推向一个更新的阶段。
