The People's Liberation Armed Forces in Quang Tri Province, South Vietnam, launched an attack on a company of U.S. aggressor troops that had been airdropped into the Thuan Phu area of Chau Thuan County on July 29. They annihilated two enemy platoons and the company command post, killing and wounding more than 80 enemy troops and capturing 15 weapons.

The guerrillas and local forces in northern Quang Tri Province carried out more than 400 battles in the first half of this year, killing and wounding over 3,900 enemy troops, including more than 2,300 U.S. aggressor troops. They shot down 27 enemy aircraft, destroyed 143 military vehicles, and eliminated nearly 500 puppets, liberating 40 villages and communes.

During this period, the guerrillas and local forces in northern Quang Tri Province displayed a high degree of patriotism, harboring deep hatred for the enemy, and resolutely defending their homeland and the lives and property of the people. They frustrated the enemy's "sweeping operations." Using flexible and mobile tactics, they employed stakes, traps, and landmines to repeatedly attack the enemy. They often surrounded enemy bases, making the enemy restless and consuming a large number of their forces.

The guerrillas and local forces in northern Quang Tri Province frequently attacked the enemy on many important transportation lines. They cut off the Ninth and First National Highways, blew up many bridges, and often paralyzed enemy transportation.

According to a report from the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency, the military and people of the Quang Tri-Thua Thien-Hue region bravely repelled the enemy's "sweeping operations" in July and early August and took the initiative to attack the enemy, achieving the result of annihilating about 2,000 enemy troops.

The report said that the U.S.-puppet clique, in an attempt to salvage their desperate situation, dispatched about 15 battalions to some areas in the Quang Tri-Thua Thien-Hue region to conduct "sweeping operations" in July. At the same time, they sent a large number of aircraft and used artillery for mad bombing and attacks, committing heinous crimes. However, the enemy's "sweeping operations" were met with a head-on counterattack by the local military and people, resulting in heavy casualties. Meanwhile, the local military and people took the initiative to surround and attack the enemy, eliminating many of the enemy's forces. In just one battle on July 2 at the 416th Hill in Phong Dien County, the People's Liberation Armed Forces annihilated the command post of the puppet army's 3rd Regiment and two infantry companies, one artillery company, and one U.S. platoon, killing and wounding about 300 U.S.-puppet troops.

Thus, in various battles, the local military and people annihilated nearly 1,500 enemy troops.

　　南越广治省北部游击队和地方部队英勇歼敌
　　今年上半年作战四百多次歼敌三千九百多，解放了四十个村和乡
    据新华社河内十一日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方广治省人民解放武装力量，七月二十九日在兆丰县尚福地区向空投到这里的一连美国侵略军发动进攻，全歼敌人两个排和敌人的连指挥部，打死打伤敌人八十多名，缴获武器十五件。
    广治省北部游击队和地方部队，在今年上半年进行了四百多次战斗，打死打伤敌人三千九百多名，其中包括美国侵略军二千三百多名，击落敌机二十七架，击毁军车一百四十三辆，消灭恶棍近五百名，解放了四十个村和乡。
    广治省北部游击队和地方部队在这期间高度发扬了爱国精神，对敌人怀着刻骨的仇恨，坚决保卫家乡，保卫人民的生命财产，粉碎了敌人的“扫荡”。他们运用灵活机动的战术，用桩板、陷阱和地雷等武器不断袭击敌人。他们还经常包围敌人的基地，打得敌人寝食不安，消耗了大量有生力量。
    广治省北部游击队和地方部队还在许多重要交通线上频频袭击敌人。他们切断了第九号公路和第一号公路，炸毁了许多桥梁，经常使敌人的交通陷于瘫痪。
    据新华社河内十日电据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方广治—承天—顺化地区军民，七月份和八月初英勇粉碎敌人的“扫荡”并主动进攻敌人，取得了歼灭敌人约两千名的战果。
    报道说，美伪集团为了挽救它们走投无路的狼狈处境，在七月份出动了约十五个营的兵力，到广治—承天—顺化地区的一些地方进行“扫荡”，同时，还出动大批飞机、使用大炮，进行疯狂的轰炸和袭击，犯下了滔天的罪行。但是，敌人的“扫荡”，遭到当地军民的迎头痛击，死伤惨重。与此同时，当地军民主动包围和进攻敌人，消灭敌人许多有生力量。仅是七月二日在丰田县第四一六号高地袭击敌军驻地一仗中，人民解放武装力量就全歼伪军第三团指挥部以及两个步兵连、一个炮兵连和美军一个排，共打死打伤美伪军约三百名。
    这样，在各次战斗中，当地军民共消灭敌人近一千五百名。
