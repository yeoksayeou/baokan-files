The military and people of Yunnan, numbering 23 million of various ethnic groups, warmly celebrate the issuance of the latest directive by our great leader Chairman Mao and the glorious birth of the Yunnan Provincial and Kunming Municipal Revolutionary Committees amidst the stormy class struggle. On this joyous day, from the provincial capital Kunming to the border villages, from factories and mines to rural and pastoral areas, revolutionary masses across the province held celebration meetings, repeatedly and seriously studying the directive of our great leader Chairman Mao, as conveyed in the editorials of the People's Daily and the Liberation Army Daily: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully unleash the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work. The working class should also continuously raise its political consciousness in the struggle."

The newly born Yunnan Provincial Revolutionary Committee held a full meeting of its members to seriously study and discuss Chairman Mao's latest directive. Everyone unanimously pointed out that Chairman Mao's latest directive has indicated the direction for the new revolutionary committee. They expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, fully unleashing the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work. They also expressed their determination to unify their understanding, steps, and actions with Mao Zedong Thought, criticizing the reactionary bourgeoisie's "multi-center theory," implementing democratic centralism, and continuously strengthening the revolutionary unity of the revolutionary committee's leadership core, the unity between the military and the people, the revolutionary unity among revolutionary mass organizations, and the revolutionary unity among various ethnic groups. They will build the revolutionary committee into a battle command center that forever holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and follows the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin.

Revolutionary workers on the coal industry front in Yunnan said in their study and discussion: Chairman Mao's latest directive is the greatest support, care, and encouragement for the working class. We must forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, grasp the revolution, promote production, fully unleash the main force role of the working class, continuously raise our political consciousness in the revolutionary struggle, and closely unite with the revolutionary masses of the entire province, following Chairman Mao to victory! Workers of the Yangfangao locomotive section of the Kunming Railway Bureau, who have achieved remarkable results in the Cultural Revolution, said that practical struggle has made us deeply realize: following the great leader Chairman Mao is victory. In the future, we will strive to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, continuously raise our political consciousness, and continue to play the main force role in the Cultural Revolution and all work.

Revolutionary masses of all ethnic groups in the province unanimously expressed their determination to cherish the newly born revolutionary committee like their own eyes. Under the leadership of the Yunnan Provincial Revolutionary Committee, they will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasize proletarian politics, and launch a broader and deeper mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. They will carry out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticizing and exposing the reactionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Yunnan, Yan Hongyan and Zhao Jianmin. In the revolutionary criticism, they will further consolidate and develop the great alliance and the three-in-one combination, do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and reform of each unit, and thoroughly implement Chairman Mao's great call for "supporting the military and loving the people" and "grasping the revolution, promoting production, work, and preparedness." They will carry the Cultural Revolution to the end.

In the border regions of Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture, Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, and Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, people of various ethnic groups emphasized in their celebration meetings that Yunnan is a key strategic location on the country's border, the frontline against American imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and foreign reactionaries. The class struggle here is extremely sharp and complex. We must heighten our revolutionary vigilance, strengthen our awareness of the enemy, strengthen military-civilian unity, and build the southwestern border of our motherland into an iron wall.

Our great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully unleash the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work. The working class should also continuously raise its political consciousness in the struggle." The broad ranks of officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Yunnan, while warmly celebrating the glorious birth of the Yunnan Provincial and Kunming Municipal Revolutionary Committees, seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest directive. They are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, remember Chairman Mao's teachings, fully unleash the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution. They expressed their determination to take the path of supporting the government and loving the people, to be the strong backing of the revolutionary committee, and to achieve new victories in the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution.

The broad ranks of officers and soldiers, who are celebrating the birth of the Yunnan Provincial Revolutionary Committee, were overjoyed upon hearing Chairman Mao's latest directive. Many units held nighttime meetings and parades, warmly celebrating the issuance of Chairman Mao's latest directive. The officers and soldiers carried portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao, waved red copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and repeatedly shouted: "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal youth! Eternal youth!" Various units also sent hundreds of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to factories, rural areas, institutions, and schools, propagating Chairman Mao's latest directive and performing artistic programs that praise the great leader Chairman Mao, the working class, and the revolutionary committee. The military and civilians together, singing and dancing, warmly celebrated the issuance of the latest directive by the great leader Chairman Mao and the glorious birth of the Yunnan Provincial Revolutionary Committee.

Officers and soldiers of a certain division of the People's Liberation Army, who are executing the "three supports, two militaries" tasks in the coal system of Yunnan Province and the Kunming Railway Bureau, were extremely moved upon hearing Chairman Mao's latest directive while celebrating the birth of the Yunnan Provincial Revolutionary Committee. They said: In the past two years, we have deeply felt in our support work in the coal mines that Chairman Mao's latest directive is extremely wise and correct. We have seen with our own eyes: the working class follows the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin the closest, understands and executes Chairman Mao's latest directive, even if they do not understand it temporarily, they still execute it, and deepen their understanding in the process of execution. The working class strongly opposes the bad practice of saying one thing and doing another and the hypocritical behavior of the two-faced. The working class studies Mao Zedong Thought, truly linking theory with practice; studying and applying it actively, learning what is urgently needed first, seeing results immediately, and working hard on the "use" aspect. They most resolutely resist the evil behavior of taking what they need from Chairman Mao's directives, interpreting them out of context, and even distorting them. The working class has the strongest revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline. The working class is the best at grasping the revolution and promoting production. We will resolutely execute the latest directive of the great leader Chairman Mao and learn from the working class.

While celebrating the issuance of Chairman Mao's latest directive and the establishment of the Yunnan Provincial Revolutionary Committee, the officers and soldiers of a certain Red Army division, who have followed Chairman Mao in his southern and northern expeditions, were in high spirits. They used their own battle history to explain that the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin is the only leadership center for the entire party, the entire army, and the entire country. They said: The entire party, the entire army, and the entire country can only have such a center and cannot have a second center. We resolutely oppose the reactionary bourgeoisie's "multi-center theory" and are determined to unite with the working class and hundreds of millions of revolutionary people around the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, unifying our understanding, steps, and actions, and achieving a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution.

Yunnan is located on the border of our motherland, serving as the southwestern shield against American imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and foreign reactionaries, and as the frontline of the anti-American struggle. The broad ranks of officers and soldiers unanimously expressed their determination to strengthen their awareness of the enemy, heighten their revolutionary vigilance, and unite with the people of various ethnic groups to jointly defend against the enemy and consolidate the border.

    全省各族革命群众一致表示，要象爱护眼珠一样爱护新生的革命委员会。在云南省革命委员会的领导下，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，掀起一个更广泛、深入的活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动新高潮，深入持久地开展革命的大批判，把中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在云南的代理人阎红彦、赵健民之流推行的反革命修正主义路线批深批透，批倒批臭。在革命大批判中进一步巩固和发展革命的大联合和革命的三结合，搞好各单位的斗、批、改。进一步贯彻执行毛主席关于“拥军爱民”和“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”的伟大号召，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。

    据新华社昆明十五日电　我们伟大领袖毛主席最近指出：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”人民解放军驻云南部队广大指战员，在热烈欢呼云南省和昆明市革命委员会光荣诞生的时候，认真学习了毛主席的最新指示，决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，牢记毛主席的教导，充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。他们表示坚决走拥政爱民的道路，誓作革命委员会的坚强后盾，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利立新功。
    正在欢呼云南省革命委员会诞生的广大指战员，听到毛主席的最新指示，欢欣鼓舞。许多部队连夜举行集会游行，热烈欢呼毛主席最新指示的发表。指战员们抬着伟大领袖毛主席的画像，挥动红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，一遍又一遍地高呼：“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”“敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”各部队还派出了数百个毛泽东思想宣传队深入工厂、农村、机关、学校，宣传毛主席的最新指示，演出歌颂伟大领袖毛主席，歌颂工人阶级和革命委员会好的文艺节目。军民一起，载歌载舞，热烈欢呼伟大领袖毛主席最新指示的发表，热烈欢呼云南省革命委员会光荣诞生。

    云南地处祖国边疆，是反对美帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派斗争的西南屏障，是反美斗争的前哨阵地。广大指战员一致表示，要加强敌情观念，百倍提高革命警惕，和各族人民群众团结一致，共同对敌，巩固边防。
