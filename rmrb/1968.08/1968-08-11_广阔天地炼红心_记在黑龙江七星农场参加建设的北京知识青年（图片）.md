The vast countryside is a boundless expanse where one can achieve great things. At the end of last year, amidst the fervent Cultural Revolution, a group of Beijing youth, with hearts aflame for Chairman Mao, volunteered to go to the Seven Star Farm in Heilongjiang to labor and build, determined to temper themselves into steadfast successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. These young people are growing and tempering themselves in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment!

With hearts ever loyal to the red sun, and hands weaving the earth red. Chairman Mao points out the path to brightness, and for a lifetime, we will take root among the workers and peasants. The youth eagerly study Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide their actions, always and everywhere acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions.

After arriving at the farm, some became farmworkers, some became livestock keepers, cooks, medical aides, or primary school teachers. Everyone is striving to build socialism for our motherland. This is a young mechanic carefully studying the repair of agricultural machinery.

The harvest season has arrived. The young people, gazing at the boundless golden waves of wheat, feel boundless joy and happiness. They celebrate not only the bumper harvest of grain but also the fact that in this vast expanse, they have tempered their thoughts to be fiery red.

Inheriting the glorious tradition of hard work and enterprise from the old pioneers, and carrying forward the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance, the youth are taking it upon themselves to build a new school for the reclamation area.

The youth's Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team often performs self-arranged artistic programs during breaks from labor, enthusiastically praising the great leader Chairman Mao and enthusiastically propagating the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

Learning from the poor and lower-middle peasants, the youth humbly learn from the workers and peasants. In practice, they deeply realize that in front of the poor and lower-middle peasants, they are forever students.

Remembering Chairman Mao's teaching to "always participate in the criticism of the bourgeoisie," the youth actively throw themselves into the great storms of class struggle. The farm's youth and revolutionary masses together fiercely criticize Liu Shaoqi, launching a fierce attack on the class enemy.

　　广阔天地炼红心
　　——记在黑龙江七星农场参加建设的北京知识青年
    “农村是一个广阔的天地，在那里是可以大有作为的。”去年年底，在轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命中，首都一批知识青年怀着对毛主席的赤胆忠心，志愿到黑龙江七星农场参加劳动，决心把自己锻炼成为一个坚强的无产阶级革命事业的接班人。这些知识青年正在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动中锻炼成长！
　　红心永向红太阳，双手绣出地球红。毛主席指出光明路，一辈子扎根在工农中。青年们如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想统帅自己的行动，时时、处处按照毛主席指示办事。
　　青年们到农场后，有的当了农工，有的当了饲养员、炊事员，有的当了卫生员、小学教师……人人都为祖国社会主义建设而努力奋斗。这是青年修配工在认真学习修理农业机械。
　　收获的季节到来了。知识青年们望着一望无际的金色麦浪，无限喜悦，无限幸福。他们庆贺的不仅是粮食的丰收，更值得庆贺的是在广阔的天地里炼得思想红彤彤。
　　继承老农垦战士艰苦创业的光荣传统，发扬自力更生的革命精神，青年们自己动手，正在为垦区建造一所新的小学校。
　　青年们组织的毛泽东思想宣传队，经常利用劳动的间隙演出自己编排的文艺节目，热情颂扬伟大的领袖毛主席，热情宣传战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
　　拜贫下中农为师，虚心向工农群众学习。知识青年在实践中深刻地体会到：在贫下中农面前，自己是一个永不毕业的小学生。

　　牢记毛主席“要随时参加批判资产阶级”的教导，积极投身到阶级斗争的大风大浪中。农场的知识青年和革命群众一起狠批中国赫鲁晓夫，向阶级敌人展开了猛烈的进攻。
