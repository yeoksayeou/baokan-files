Indian revolutionaries, despite the suppression and obstruction by the Indian reactionary government, have published another revolutionary journal, *People's War*, as an important weapon for spreading Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought among the Indian people. The first issue of this Hindi weekly was published on August 8 in Calcutta.

The first page of the inaugural issue of *People's War* features a photograph of Mao Zedong, the great leader of the proletariat, and a quotation from Mao: "What is the real iron wall? It is the masses, the tens of millions of people who truly support the revolution. This is the real iron wall, which no force can break, absolutely no force can break. The counter-revolution cannot break us, but we will break the counter-revolution. Around the revolutionary government, we must rally tens of millions of people, develop our revolutionary war, and we will be able to annihilate all counter-revolutionaries and seize all of China."

The inaugural issue of *People's War* also includes Mao Zedong's brilliant work *In Memory of Norman Bethune*.

The inaugural issue of *People's War* features an article titled "Advancing the Indian Revolution." Alongside this article is a quotation from Mao: "The central task and highest form of the revolution is to seize political power through armed struggle, to solve problems through war. This Marxist-Leninist revolutionary principle is universally correct, whether in China or abroad, it is universally correct."

In the editorial position, the article "*People's War* is Published" enthusiastically praises the great leader of the proletariat, Mao Zedong, and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. It states, "This journal is being published at a time when the whole world is illuminated by a rising sun, a sun of the thought of the great leader Mao Zedong—the red sun. India is also illuminated by the red rays of this red sun; under the illumination of this sun, Naxalbari has awakened; under the illumination of this sun, Bihar and the Terai region of Uttar Pradesh have awakened; Nagas, Mizos, and Kukis have awakened; under its illumination, the revolutionary communists of the entire country have awakened."

"The one who illuminates the dark path is this red sun; the one who shows the path of liberation to the exploited and oppressed people is this red sun. Therefore, we wish for this red sun, again and again we wish for this red sun!"

"Under the inspiration of this red sun, the revolutionary communists have raised the slogan of boycotting elections, because the path to liberation is not through elections, but through armed struggle. Chairman Mao teaches us that 'political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.' Spreading this truth to every individual is the first step."

The article states: "Chairman Mao also tells us, 'The world is progressing, the future is bright, and this historical trend cannot be changed by anyone. We should often propagate to the people the progress of the world and the bright future, so that the people can establish a confidence in victory.'"

"This is the purpose of *People's War*. Today, we see the bright future of our country from the thought of Chairman Mao, so the main purpose of *People's War* is to propagate this thought and establish a confidence in victory among the people."

Indian revolutionaries have already published the English monthly *Liberation* and the Bengali weekly *Patriot*. They originally planned to publish the Hindi weekly *Patriot*, but were brutally obstructed by the Indian reactionary government. The Indian reactionary government, in June of this year, dispatched a large number of police and secret agents to unreasonably search the editorial office and printing plant of the Bengali weekly *Patriot*, persecuting the staff of this revolutionary weekly. However, the revolutionary actions of Indian revolutionaries to propagate Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought cannot be stopped by the brutal oppression of the Indian reactionary government. Currently, Indian revolutionaries are striving to combine Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought with the actual situation in India, pushing the Indian revolution forward.

    广泛传播马列主义和毛泽东思想
    印度革命者出版革命刊物《人民战争》
    创刊号文章热情歌颂无产阶级的伟大领袖毛主席和战无不胜的毛泽东思想
    新华社二十四日讯　新德里消息：印度革命者冲破印度反动政府的压制和阻挠，又出版了一种革命刊物《人民战争》，作为他们在印度人民中广泛传播马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的重要武器。这份印地文周刊的创刊号已于八月八日在加尔各答出版。
    《人民战争》创刊号第一版刊载了无产阶级的伟大领袖毛主席的照片和毛主席的语录：“真正的铜墙铁壁是什么？是群众，是千百万真心实意地拥护革命的群众。这是真正的铜墙铁壁，什么力量也打不破的，完全打不破的。反革命打不破我们，我们却要打破反革命。在革命政府的周围团结起千百万群众来，发展我们的革命战争，我们就能消灭一切反革命，我们就能夺取全中国。”
    《人民战争》创刊号刊载了毛主席的光辉著作《为人民服务》。
    《人民战争》创刊号刊载了一篇文章，题目是《把印度革命推向前进》。结合这篇文章刊登了毛主席语录：“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。这个马克思列宁主义的革命原则是普遍地对的，不论在中国在外国，一概都是对的。”
    在社论位置发表的《〈人民战争〉的出版》一文，热情歌颂无产阶级的伟大领袖毛主席和战无不胜的毛泽东思想。它说，这个刊物“是在这样一个时候开始出版的，即全世界被一轮初升的太阳所照耀的时候，这个太阳是伟大领袖毛泽东主席的思想的太阳——红太阳。印度也同样为这个红太阳的红色光芒所照耀，在这个太阳的光辉照耀下纳萨尔巴里觉醒了；在这个太阳的光辉照耀下比哈尔邦和北方邦特莱（平原）地区觉醒了；那加—米佐和库基觉醒了；在它的光辉照耀下全国的共产党革命派觉醒了。”
    “照亮了黑暗道路的是这个红太阳；指明了被剥削被压迫人民解放道路的是这个红太阳。所以，我们祝愿这个红太阳，一遍又一遍地祝愿这个红太阳！”
    “在这个红太阳的鼓舞下共产党革命派提出了抵制选举的口号，因为解放的道路不是选举，而是武装斗争。毛主席教导我们‘枪杆子里面出政权’。把这个真理传播给每一个群众，这是开始的一步。”
    文章说：“毛主席还告诉我们，‘世界是在进步的，前途是光明的，这个历史的总趋势任何人也改变不了。我们应当把世界进步的情况和光明的前途，常常向人民宣传，使人民建立起胜利的信心。’”
    “这就是《人民战争》的宗旨，今天从毛主席的思想中看到了我国的光辉前途，所以《人民战争》的主要目的是宣传这个思想并使人民建立起胜利的信心。”
    印度革命者已经出版了英文的《解放》月刊和孟加拉文的《爱国者》周刊。他们本来打算出版印地文的《爱国者》周刊，但是受到印度反动政府的横蛮阻挠。印度反动政府在今年六月间还曾经派出大批警察、特务，无理搜查孟加拉文《爱国者》周刊的编辑部和印刷厂，迫害这家革命周刊的工作人员。但是，印度革命者宣传马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的革命行动，决不是印度反动政府的残暴压迫所能阻止得住的。现在，印度革命者正努力把马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想同印度实际情况相结合，推动着印度革命前进。
