The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has brought about profound changes in people's spiritual outlook. "Spirit can be transformed into material force." Once the revolutionary masses grasp the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, they will become a tremendous material force for transforming the world. The General Logistics Department of the People's Liberation Army and several units under the Railway Corps, in the midst of the surging Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production." They have emphasized proletarian politics, vigorously promoted the ideological transformation of people, used revolution to drive production, and have achieved bountiful harvests on both the spiritual and material fronts.
