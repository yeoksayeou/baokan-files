The world's peoples must unite more closely and launch a sustained and fierce offensive against our common enemy, US imperialism and its lackeys!

The Palestine Liberation Movement strongly condemns the new conspiracy of US imperialism to invade the Arab world. It will resolutely carry the struggle for the liberation of Palestine through to the end. The Palestinian people do not want "United Nations forces" and are determined to smash the new conspiracy of US imperialism with armed violence.

New China News Agency, Baghdad, August 19th — According to recent reports in Baghdad newspapers, "Al-Fatah" (Palestine Liberation Movement) broadcast a letter to the Arab nation on August 14th via the "Voice of the Storm" radio station, strongly condemning the conspiracy of US imperialism to station "United Nations forces" along the so-called "ceasefire line" between Jordan and Israel.

The letter to the Arab nation said that the new conspiracy of US imperialism aims to establish an "international barrier" to protect the imperialist-Zionist base established on occupied Arab land, in order to counter the Palestinian revolutionary forces.

It went on to say that under these circumstances, the stance of the Palestinian revolutionary people towards this conspiracy will be the same as their stance towards all imperialist conspiracies disguised as the United Nations, which is absolute rejection, no surrender, no international forces, and an unshakable determination to carry the struggle for the liberation of Palestine through to the end.

The letter to the Arab nation said that Palestinian fighters are determined to smash this new conspiracy with armed violence. The revolutionary people of Palestine will regard the international forces sent to the "ceasefire line" as enemy troops and any country that dares to send troops there as an enemy country.

The letter to the Arab nation concluded by saying that victory will certainly belong to our Arab nation and to the Palestinian revolution, which will continue to burn fiercely until victory is achieved.

Since the US and Israel launched their aggression against the Arab countries last June, US imperialism has been directing its tool of aggression, Israel, to launch new military provocations and exert military pressure on Arab countries such as Jordan, and through the United Nations, it has been plotting to force Arab countries to surrender with its so-called "political solution" conspiracy. After Israel launched a large-scale surprise attack on the Jordanian territory east of the Jordan River on August 4th, the US representative to the United Nations, Arthur Goldberg, immediately called for the United Nations to station personnel along the so-called "ceasefire line" between Jordan and Israel, in an attempt to disrupt the just struggle of the Arab people. As early as 1956, during the aggression by Britain, France, and Israel against Egypt, US imperialism had manipulated the United Nations to send a so-called "United Nations Emergency Force" to station in the Sinai Peninsula of the United Arab Republic. It was not until May 1967, amidst the massive anti-US wave of the Arab people, that this "United Nations force" was forced to withdraw. Now, US imperialism is playing the same trick again, and it will certainly once again lift a stone to drop it on its own feet.

    全世界人民更紧密地团结起来，向着我们的共同敌人美帝国主义及其帮凶们发动持久的猛烈的进攻！
    巴勒斯坦解放运动强烈谴责美帝侵略阿拉伯的新阴谋
    坚决把解放巴勒斯坦的斗争进行到底
    巴勒斯坦人民不要“联合国部队”　决心用武装暴力粉碎美帝新阴谋
    新华社巴格达十九日电　据巴格达报纸最近报道：“法塔赫”（巴勒斯坦解放运动）十四日通过“暴风之声”电台广播告阿拉伯民族书，强烈谴责美帝国主义企图在约旦和以色列之间的所谓“停火线”一带驻扎“联合国部队”的阴谋。
    告阿拉伯民族书说，美帝国主义的这一新阴谋，目的在于建立一个“国际屏障”，来保护建立在被占领的阿拉伯土地上的帝国主义——犹太复国主义基地，以对付巴勒斯坦革命力量。
    它接着说，在这种情况下，巴勒斯坦革命人民对这一阴谋将采取的立场，同他们历来对一切披着骗人的联合国外衣的帝国主义阴谋所采取的立场是一样的，这就是绝对拒绝，决不投降，不要国际部队，毫不动摇地把解放巴勒斯坦的斗争进行到底。
    告阿拉伯民族书说，巴勒斯坦战士决心用武装暴力来粉碎这一新阴谋。巴勒斯坦的革命人民将把开到“停火线”上的国际部队看作敌军，把任何胆敢派兵到那里去的国家看作敌对国家。
    告阿拉伯民族书最后说，胜利必定属于我们阿拉伯民族，必定属于将继续熊熊燃烧到胜利的巴勒斯坦革命。
    自从去年六月美以对阿拉伯国家发动侵略战争以来，美帝国主义指使它的侵略工具以色列不断地向约旦等阿拉伯国家发动新的军事挑衅，施加军事压力，并通过联合国策划诱迫阿拉伯国家投降的所谓“政治解决”的阴谋。在八月四日以色列再次对约旦河东岸的约旦领土发动大规模的突然袭击之后，美国驻联合国首席代表鲍尔紧接着就在联合国安理会上大叫大嚷要由联合国派人驻扎在约旦和以色列之间的所谓“停火线”一带，妄图用以破坏阿拉伯人民的正义斗争。早在一九五六年英、法、以侵略埃及的时候，美帝国主义曾经操纵联合国派遣一支所谓“联合国紧急部队”驻扎在阿联的西奈半岛。在一九六七年五月，在阿拉伯人民掀起大规模的反美浪潮中，这支“联合国部队”才被迫撤走。美帝国主义现在又在玩弄这类阴谋，它必将再次搬起石头砸自己的脚。
