Most Decisively Condemn the Soviet Revisionists and Their Running Dogs' Barbaric Invasion
Express the Most Decisive Internationalist Support and Solidarity to the Fraternal People of Czechoslovakia
Solemnly Declare: Whoever Dares to Touch the Sacred Borders of the People's Republic of Albania, Even If It Is a Member of the Warsaw Pact, Will Suffer the Deserved Retaliation and Be Defeated by the Albanian People
New China News Agency, Tirana, August 23 — The Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania and the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Albania issued a solemn declaration on August 22 condemning the armed intervention and invasion of Czechoslovakia by the treacherous gang of Soviet revisionists. The full text of the declaration is as follows:

On the night of August 20 to the early morning of August 21, 1968, the armed forces of the Soviet Union, the Polish People's Republic, the German Democratic Republic, the Hungarian People's Republic, and the People's Republic of Bulgaria, blatantly violated all the principles guiding relations between states, and cowardly and shamelessly launched a barbaric invasion of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic and the Czechoslovak people with fascist methods, forcibly occupying the entire territory of Czechoslovakia.

At the time when the invading forces were attacking and invading Czechoslovakia from several directions, the Czechoslovak revisionist traitor leadership headed by Alexander Dubček continued to slide down the road of betraying the interests of their own people. They were terrified by the invading army, shamefully surrendered, and called on the Czechoslovak people and their army not to resist the foreign occupying forces in any way to defend their homeland.

The Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania and the Government of the People's Republic of Albania most decisively condemn and denounce the barbaric invasion of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic and the Czechoslovak people by the Soviet revisionists and their running dogs, as well as the betrayal and surrender of the Czechoslovak revisionist leadership.

The Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania and the Government of the People's Republic of Albania believe that the root of the Czechoslovak tragedy lies in the 20th Congress of the CPSU. The 20th Congress of the CPSU overturned the Marxist-Leninist line of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union under Lenin and Stalin, replacing it with the reactionary revisionist line of Khrushchev. This line led to the resurgence of Czechoslovak revisionist forces, resulting in disastrous consequences within the Soviet Union itself and placing the entire international communist movement in difficulty. The military occupation of Czechoslovakia by the Soviet revisionists and their running dogs is the result of the collusion between the Soviet revisionist traitor leadership and American imperialism in pursuing a global strategy.

The invasion of Czechoslovakia by the Soviet revisionists and their running dogs is a fascist invasion, a blatant violation of the principles of freedom and sovereignty of all peoples. The shameless invasion by the Brezhnev-Kosygin group of the Khrushchev revisionists has brought the greatest disgrace to the honor and prestige of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people. After this despicable invasion, no one in the world will have the slightest trust in the Soviet leadership. This invasion most powerfully reminds the Soviet people, the peoples of all socialist countries and countries ruled by revisionist cliques, the peoples of Europe and all countries in the world, to be vigilant against the danger of the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique currently ruling the Soviet Union, against the plots of this clique to rule over the peoples of various countries, and against the imperialist-fascist methods adopted by this clique in collusion with American imperialism.

The invasion of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic by the revisionists under the banner of the Warsaw Pact once again proves that what the Party of Labour of Albania and the Government of the People's Republic of Albania have long declared is true: the Warsaw Pact is no longer a treaty to protect the signatory socialist countries from imperialist and West German revanchist aggression. The Warsaw Pact has become a treaty of war and slavery, a treaty of aggression against the socialist countries themselves. Therefore, the Party of Labour of Albania, the Government of the People's Republic of Albania, and the Albanian people denounce this treaty of aggression with the utmost hatred and solemnly declare: whoever dares to touch the sacred borders of the People's Republic of Albania, even if it is a member of the Warsaw Pact, will suffer the deserved retaliation and will be defeated by the Albanian people, who are firmly united around the Party of Labour of Albania and its government.

At this tragic moment for the Czechoslovak people, the Party of Labour of Albania, the Government of the People's Republic of Albania, and the Albanian people express the most decisive internationalist support and solidarity to the fraternal Czechoslovak people. They have full confidence in the revolutionary spirit of the Czechoslovak people who love freedom. They believe that the only self-saving path for the Czechoslovak people to regain their freedom is to wage an uncompromising and persistent struggle against the foreign occupiers of the Soviet, German, Polish, Hungarian, and Bulgarian revisionists, against American imperialism and German revanchism, and against all revisionists and reactionaries within the country. This struggle will be arduous and protracted. But this is the only correct and possible path to save Czechoslovakia and defend freedom and socialism. The Albanian people have followed this path, so they are now free and independent, and they have foiled the various plots of imperialism-revisionism.

The Albanian people, from their personal experience and long history, firmly believe that freedom will not be given as a gift, but must be paid for with blood and sacrifice. This is why the Party of Labour of Albania, the Albanian government, and the Albanian people call on the true revolutionary communists and the freedom-loving Czechoslovak people to rise up and wage an uncompromising and persistent struggle against the revisionist occupiers and domestic enemies, to believe in themselves and not be isolated, to believe that the peoples of all countries who love freedom support their struggle, and to believe that the true revolutionary communists and peoples of the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic, Poland, Hungary, and Bulgaria, who are suffering under the rule of the revisionist clique that plotted the barbaric invasion of Czechoslovakia, are also on their side. Albanian communists and the Albanian people will forever support the struggle of the Czechoslovak people for freedom. The Czechoslovak people will surely achieve victory in this struggle for liberation.

The Party of Labour of Albania, the Government of the People's Republic of Albania, and the Albanian people, full of confidence, call on the true Bolsheviks and the people of the Soviet Union to rise up and wage a struggle against the fascist-revisionist clique that oppresses them, to stage another great October Revolution, to completely bury the infamous 20th Congress and all its tragic consequences at home and abroad, to overthrow the Brezhnev-Kosygin revisionist clique, to withdraw the Soviet occupying forces from Czechoslovakia, and to withdraw from all other countries where they are stationed for control.

The Party of Labour of Albania, the Government of the People's Republic of Albania, and the Albanian people appeal to all revolutionary communists and all freedom-loving peoples of the world to support the sacred cause of freedom of the Czechoslovak people, to condemn the barbaric invasion of the Soviet revisionists and their running dogs, and to smash the great conspiracy of the Soviet-American domination of the world, which has become the root of the fascist means of oppressing the peoples of various countries and depriving them of their freedom.

    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央和部长会议就苏修叛徒集团侵占捷克斯洛伐克发表严正声明
    最坚决谴责苏修及其走狗的野蛮侵略
    向兄弟的捷克斯洛伐克人民表示最坚决的国际主义声援和支持
      郑重宣告：谁胆敢碰一碰阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国的神圣边界，那怕它是华沙条约的成员国，都必将遭到应得的回击，并为阿尔巴尼亚人民所击败
    新华社地拉那二十三日电　阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国部长会议二十二日就苏修叛徒集团武装干涉和侵略捷克斯洛伐克发表严正声明。声明全文如下：
    一九六八年八月二十日深夜至二十一日凌晨，苏联、波兰人民共和国、德意志民主共和国、匈牙利人民共和国和保加利亚人民共和国的军队，明目张胆地违反指导国家之间的关系的一切准则，卑鄙无耻地突然以法西斯手段对捷克斯洛伐克社会主义共和国和捷克斯洛伐克人民进行了野蛮的侵略，用武力占领了捷克斯洛伐克的全部领土。
    在占领军从几个方向同时进攻和侵犯捷克斯洛伐克领土的时候，以亚历山大·杜布切克为首的捷克斯洛伐克修正主义叛徒领导集团，一直在背叛本国人民利益的道路上滑下去，它被侵略军吓得丧魂落魄，最可耻地投降了，它呼吁捷克斯洛伐克人民及其军队不要为保卫祖国而对外国占领军进行任何抵抗。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府，最坚决地谴责和声讨苏联修正主义者及其走狗对捷克斯洛伐克社会主义共和国和捷克斯洛伐克人民的野蛮侵略，以及捷克斯洛伐克修正主义领导集团的背叛和投降。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府认为，捷克斯洛伐克的悲剧的祸根在于苏共二十次代表大会。苏共二十大推翻了列宁—斯大林的苏联共产党的马克思列宁主义路线，代之以赫鲁晓夫的反动的修正主义路线。这条路线甚至导致捷克斯洛伐克修正主义势力重新抬头，导致在苏联本身产生灾难的后果，并使整个国际共产主义运动面临困难。苏联修正主义者及其走狗对捷克斯洛伐克的军事占领，是苏联修正主义叛徒领导集团和美帝国主义相互勾结推行全球战略的结果。
    苏修及其走狗对捷克斯洛伐克的侵略，是法西斯的侵略，是对各国人民的自由和主权原则的最明目张胆的破坏。勃列日涅夫—柯西金这个赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团的这一无耻的侵略，使苏联和苏联人民的荣誉和威信蒙受了最大的耻辱。在这一卑鄙侵略发生之后，世界上任何人都不会对苏联领导集团有一丝一毫的信任。这一侵略最有力地提醒了苏联人民、各社会主义国家和修正主义集团统治的国家的人民、欧洲和全世界各国人民，对目前统治着苏联的反革命修正主义集团的危险性，对这个集团统治各国人民的图谋，对这个集团在同美帝国主义勾结的基础上采取帝国主义的法西斯手段，要保持警惕。
    修正主义者打着华沙条约的旗号对捷克斯洛伐克社会主义共和国的侵略，再一次证明了阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府早就宣告的，即：华沙条约已经不再是使社会主义国家签字国免受帝国主义和西德复仇主义侵略的条约。华沙条约已经从一个和平条约变成了一个战争和奴役的条约，从一个防御帝国主义侵略的条约变成一个侵略社会主义国家本身的条约。因此，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党、阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府和阿尔巴尼亚人民怀着万分的憎恨声讨这个侵略条约，并且郑重宣告：谁胆敢碰一碰阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国的神圣边界，那怕它是华沙条约的成员国，都必将遭到应得的回击，必将被坚如磐石地团结在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党及其政府周围的阿尔巴尼亚人民所击败。
    当捷克斯洛伐克人民处于悲剧性的这一时刻，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党、阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府和阿尔巴尼亚人民，向兄弟的捷克斯洛伐克人民表示最坚决的国际主义的声援和支持。她们对捷克斯洛伐克人民热爱自由的革命精神满怀信心。她们认为，捷克斯洛伐克人民重新获得自由的唯一自救的道路，就是同苏联、德国、波兰、匈牙利和保加利亚修正主义外国占领者进行不妥协的、坚持到底的斗争，同美帝国主义和德国复仇主义进行斗争，同本国的一切修正主义者和反动派进行斗争。这场斗争将是艰巨的和长期的。但是这是拯救捷克斯洛伐克、捍卫自由和社会主义的唯一正确和可能的道路。阿尔巴尼亚人民遵循了这条道路，所以他们现在是自由的和独立自主的，他们挫败了帝国主义—修正主义的种种阴谋。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民从切身的经验和漫长的历史中深信不疑地体会到，谁也不会把自由作为礼物送上门来，而是要付出流血牺牲的代价才能获得。这也就是为什么阿尔巴尼亚劳动党、阿尔巴尼亚政府和阿尔巴尼亚人民，呼吁捷克斯洛伐克真正革命的共产党人和爱好自由的捷克斯洛伐克人民起来进行毫不妥协的和坚持到底的斗争，来抗击修正主义占领者和国内的敌人，坚信自己并不孤立，坚信爱好自由的世界各国人民都支持自己的斗争，坚信在策划了对捷克斯洛伐克的野蛮侵略的修正主义集团统治下受苦受难的苏联、德意志民主共和国、波兰、匈牙利和保加利亚的真正革命的共产党人和人民也都是站在自己一边的。阿尔巴尼亚共产党人和阿尔巴尼亚人民将永远支持捷克斯洛伐克人民为争取自由而进行的斗争。捷克斯洛伐克人民必将在这场争取解放的斗争中取得胜利。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党、阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府和阿尔巴尼亚人民满怀信心，呼吁苏联真正的布尔什维克和苏联人民起来进行抗击压迫他们的法西斯—修正主义集团的斗争，呼吁他们再次进行伟大的十月革命，彻底埋葬臭名远扬的二十大及其在国内和国际上的一切悲剧性的后果，推翻勃列日涅夫—柯西金修正主义集团，使苏联占领军从捷克斯洛伐克撤走，从为了进行控制而驻扎的所有其他国家撤走。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党、阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府和阿尔巴尼亚人民，向全世界所有革命的共产党人和全世界爱好自由的各国人民发出呼吁，呼吁他们支持捷克斯洛伐克人民的自由的神圣事业，谴责苏联修正主义者及其走狗的野蛮侵略，并且粉碎苏—美主宰世界的大阴谋，这一阴谋已成为压迫各国人民和剥夺他们自由的法西斯手段的祸根。
