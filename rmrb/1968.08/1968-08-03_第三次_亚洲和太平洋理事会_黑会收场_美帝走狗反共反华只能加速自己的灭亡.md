The third "Asia and Pacific Council" ministerial-level meeting, which is anti-communist and anti-China, was held in Canberra from July 30th for three days and concluded on August 1st. The running dogs and henchmen of U.S. imperialism gathered together to devise strategies and serve their American master's counter-revolutionary strategy of invading Asia.

Participants in this black meeting included representatives from the U.S.-backed puppet regime in South Vietnam, representatives from the reactionary forces of South Korea, Thailand, the Philippines, Australia, and New Zealand, which have sent troops to participate in the U.S. invasion of Vietnam, representatives from the Sato government of Japan, which actively serves as a henchman for the U.S. invasion of Vietnam, representatives from the new tool of U.S.-British imperialism, "Malaysia," and representatives from the Chiang Kai-shek bandits who occupy our territory of Taiwan. The gathering of these U.S. imperialist running dogs and henchmen in Canberra discussed issues such as the "Vietnam situation," the "China problem," and the military situation in Asia, including the British withdrawal from the region east of the Suez, and jointly plotted anti-communist and anti-China conspiracies.

This meeting was held at a time when the national liberation movements in Asia are thriving, and U.S. imperialism's policy of aggression and war in Asia is on the verge of bankruptcy. The participants, who are the running dogs and henchmen of U.S. imperialism, expressed special "concern" about the internal and external difficulties they face. The facts have proven that under the impact of the surging national liberation movements in Asia, the days of U.S. imperialism and its henchmen and running dogs are getting harder and harder.

The meeting showed that the running dogs of U.S. imperialism, in order to salvage their American master's failure in South Vietnam, are vigorously promoting the U.S. imperialist's counter-revolutionary two-pronged strategy in Vietnam. The joint statement issued by the meeting on August 1st expressed "sympathy and support" for the South Vietnamese puppet regime controlled by the U.S., and, mimicking the U.S. imperialist's "peace talks" deception, shouted slogans about hoping to hold "negotiations for a just, honorable, and lasting peace (on the Vietnam issue)."

Under the instructions of U.S. imperialism, the meeting discussed the issue of tightening military collusion. Thai Foreign Minister Komon called on the members of the meeting to "quickly take steps to fill the so-called 'vacuum'" caused by the British withdrawal from the region east of the Suez. The meeting advocated cooperation with the anti-communist Southeast Asian Nations Association. It is well known that the members of the "Asia and Pacific Council" plus the members of the Southeast Asian Nations Association almost include all the members of the Northeast Asia Military Alliance, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and the ANZUS Treaty Organization. They intend to use this so-called "cooperation" to link these three military alliances together, to strengthen the encirclement of China and to intensify their anti-communist and anti-people activities.

The running dogs of U.S. imperialism staged an anti-China chorus at this meeting. They shouted hoarsely about the so-called "Chinese threat" and "absolutely not allowing China to conduct nuclear explosions," and in the joint statement, they loudly proclaimed that they are especially concerned about the "developments on the Chinese mainland."

This shows that they are diehard followers of U.S. imperialism and enemies of the Chinese people. However, the facts have proven and will continue to prove that no matter what tricks and schemes U.S. imperialism and its running dogs play, and no matter how they struggle in their dying moments, they will definitely not be able to save their failure, but will only accelerate their own demise.

### 第三次“亚洲和太平洋理事会”黑会收场　美帝走狗反共反华只能加速自己的灭亡

　　第三次“亚洲和太平洋理事会”黑会收场
　　美帝走狗反共反华只能加速自己的灭亡
    新华社二日讯　堪培拉消息：反共反华的第三次“亚洲和太平洋理事会部长级会议”，从七月三十日起在堪培拉举行了三天会议后，于一日收场。美帝的走狗和帮凶们纠集在一起，出谋划策，为其美国主子侵略亚洲的反革命战略效劳。
    参加这次黑会的有美帝在南越的傀儡政权的代表、派兵参加美帝侵越战争的南朝鲜、泰国、菲律宾、澳大利亚和新西兰反动派的代表、积极充当美帝侵越帮凶的日本佐藤政府的代表、美英帝国主义的新工具“马来西亚”的代表以及盘踞在我国领土台湾的蒋匪帮的代表等。麇集在堪培拉的这帮美帝的走狗和帮凶，就所谓“越南局势”、“中国问题”以及英帝从苏伊士以东地区撤军等亚洲的军事形势问题，进行了“讨论”，共同策划反共反华的阴谋。
    这次会议是在亚洲民族解放运动蓬勃发展，美帝在亚洲的侵略政策和战争政策濒于破产的情况下召开的。与会的美帝走狗和帮凶们对它们面临的内外交困的窘境，表示特别“忧虑”。事实证明，在亚洲汹涌澎湃的民族解放运动的浪潮打击下，美帝及其帮凶和走狗们的日子越来越不好过。
    会议表明，美帝的走狗们为了挽救其美国主子在南越的失败，正在大力推行美帝侵越的反革命两手策略。会议在八月一日发表的联合公报，对由美帝操纵的南越傀儡政权表示“同情和支持”，并效仿美帝的“和谈”骗局的调子，叫嚷希望举行“谋求公正、体面和持久和平的（越南问题）谈判”。
    在美帝的授意下，会议讨论了加紧军事勾结的问题。泰国外长科曼在会上要求会议的成员“必须赶快采取步骤填补”由于英帝从苏伊士以东地区撤军而造成的所谓“真空”。会议主张同反共的东南亚国家联盟实行“合作”。众所周知，“亚洲和太平洋理事会”的成员加上东南亚国家联盟的成员，几乎包括了东北亚军事同盟、东南亚条约组织和美澳新条约组织的所有成员。它们企图通过这种所谓“合作”，使这三个军事同盟联结在一起，以加强反华包围圈和强化它们的反共反人民的活动。
    美帝的娄罗们在这次会议上表演了反华大合唱。他们声嘶力竭地叫嚷所谓“中国威胁”和“决不能准许中国进行核爆炸”，并在联合公报中大肆叫嚣，说什么对“中国大陆上的形势发展引起的问题表示特别关注”。
    这表明它们死心塌地追随美帝，与中国人民为敌。但是，事实已经证明并将继续证明，美帝及其走狗无论玩弄什么阴谋诡计，也无论它们如何进行垂死挣扎，都决计挽救不了它们的失败，相反，只能加速它们的灭亡。
