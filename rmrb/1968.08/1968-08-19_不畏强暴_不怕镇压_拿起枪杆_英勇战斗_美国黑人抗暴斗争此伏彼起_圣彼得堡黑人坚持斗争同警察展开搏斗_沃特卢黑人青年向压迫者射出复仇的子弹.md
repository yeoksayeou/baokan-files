The struggle of American blacks against violence continues unabated. In St. Petersburg, blacks persist in their struggle, engaging in fierce battles with the police. In Waterloo, black youths fire retaliatory bullets at their oppressors.

New China News Agency, August 18th: Washington reports: The gunshots from the black anti-violence struggle in St. Petersburg have not ceased, and blacks in Waterloo, Iowa, have once again taken up arms to bravely attack the fascist police.

In St. Petersburg, Florida, despite the reactionary ruling clique dispatching a large number of fascist police to brutally suppress the blacks, the brave blacks continue their struggle. On the night of the 17th, they continued to fight fiercely with the police using stones, bottles, and other weapons for the second night, injuring at least two fascist police. The reactionary ruling authorities hurriedly brought in the "riot control vehicles" of the Florida State Police, which were recently battered by blacks in Miami, to block off large areas of black residential districts and recklessly released large amounts of tear gas. However, black snipers quietly moved out of the blockade, shooting at the fascist police from behind the blockade lines.

On the night of the 17th, black youths in Waterloo, Iowa, stood up again to fight against the fascist police and white racist elements.

Some armed black youths were very active, moving from one building to another, accurately firing retaliatory bullets at the fascist police. The city's police admitted that the bullets from the black snipers had pierced several police cars.

    美国黑人抗暴斗争此伏彼起
    圣彼得堡黑人坚持斗争同警察展开搏斗　沃特卢黑人青年向压迫者射出复仇的子弹
    新华社十八日讯　华盛顿消息：圣彼得堡黑人抗暴斗争的枪声未息，衣阿华州沃特卢黑人又拿起枪杆英勇地袭击法西斯警察。
    在佛罗里达州的圣彼得堡，尽管反动统治集团派遣了大批法西斯警察对黑人进行疯狂的镇压，英勇的黑人仍在坚持斗争。十七日晚，他们继续用石块、瓶子和警察进行第二夜的激烈搏斗，至少打伤了两名法西斯警察。反动统治当局匆匆忙忙地把十天前刚刚在迈阿密市被黑人打得破烂不堪的佛罗里达州警察的“防暴车”开来，封锁了大块黑人居住区，悍然大量施放催泪瓦斯。但是黑人狙击手却神不知鬼不觉地转移出了封锁区，在封锁线背后开枪打击法西斯警察。
    十七日晚，衣阿华州沃特卢的黑人青年又挺身而起同法西斯警察和白人种族主义分子展开了搏斗。
    一些带枪的黑人青年十分活跃，他们时而在这一幢建筑物里，时而转移到另一幢建筑物里，向法西斯警察准确地射出复仇的子弹。这个市的警察承认，黑人狙击手的子弹击穿了好几辆警车。
