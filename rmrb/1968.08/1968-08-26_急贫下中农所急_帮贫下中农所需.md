	To the Editor,

	In our county of Fǔníng, Héběi, last winter saw little snow and this spring little rain, resulting in a relatively severe drought. The robust crop seedlings have begun to turn yellow. This situation made Li Yùzhù, a worker representative who had just joined the Fǔníng County and Agricultural Machinery Factory Revolutionary Committee, very anxious. Li Yùzhù thought, now the countryside urgently needs buckets for anti-drought efforts, but the factory, busy with other production tasks, cannot produce enough buckets to meet the demand. Li Yùzhù thought, we, the working class, must address the urgent needs of our peasant brothers and assist them in their needs. We must mobilize all the workers in the factory to resolutely complete the task. Li Yùzhù went deep into the workshops and, together with the workers, launched a revolutionary big-character poster campaign, fiercely criticizing the crimes of China's Khrushchev and the capitalist roaders in our factory who advocated "profits first" and sabotaged the worker-peasant alliance. The revolutionary big-character poster campaign aroused the workers' enthusiasm, and everyone worked together. In six days, the entire factory produced 725 buckets, providing strong support for the countryside's anti-drought efforts.

	During the most critical days of the anti-drought campaign, Li Yùzhù truly had a heart-to-heart connection with the poor and lower-middle peasants. He ate and slept in the factory. A letter from home said his wife was ill and needed his care, but he put the letter in his pocket and continued to devote himself wholeheartedly to this struggle. One day, after the shift whistle blew, Li Yùzhù was washing his hands to prepare for a meal. At this time, a diesel engine was brought in from the anti-drought front in the countryside. Li Yùzhù immediately went to repair it, and it was not until nine o'clock in the evening that the machine started running, and Li Yùzhù went to eat. The driver of the cart, shaking Li Yùzhù's hand, excitedly said, "Old Li, thanks to you! You've really helped us a lot!" Li Yùzhù said, "We all owe it to Chairman Mao. It is Chairman Mao who calls on us to have a heart-to-heart connection with you. The sooner the machine is repaired, the sooner the land can be irrigated. Every extra pound of grain is a contribution to the socialist revolution."

    急贫下中农所急  帮贫下中农所需编辑同志：
    我们河北抚宁县去冬少雪，今春少雨，出现了比较严重的旱情，茁壮的禾苗有的开始发黄。这个情况使刚刚参加抚宁县和农机厂革委会的工人代表李玉柱同志十分着急。李玉柱想，现在农村抗旱急需要水桶，可是厂里因忙于其他生产任务，每天生产的水桶，远远不能满足需要。李玉柱想，我们工人阶级，要急农民兄弟所急，帮农民兄弟所需。一定要发动全厂工人坚决完成任务。李玉柱深入到车间和工人同志一起开展革命大批判，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫和本厂走资派大搞“利润挂帅”，破坏工农联盟的罪行。革命的大批判，激发了工人的积极性，大家同心协力，在六天内，全厂就做出了七百二十五个水桶，有力地支援了农村抗旱。
    在抗旱最紧张的日子里，李玉柱同志真是和贫下中农社员心连心，他吃在厂里，睡在厂里，家里来信说他爱人病了，要他照管，他把信往口袋里一放，仍是全心全意地投入了这场斗争。一天下班铃响过了，李玉柱正洗手准备吃饭，这时从农村抗旱前线拉来一台柴油机，李玉柱马上去抢修，一直到晚上九点机器转动了，李玉柱才去吃饭。赶车的社员握着李玉柱的手，激动地说：“老李，多亏了你呀，真帮了我们的大忙啦！”李玉柱说：“咱都多亏了毛主席，是毛主席他老人家叫咱和你们心连心的。机器早修好一分钟，就早浇一些地。多打一斤粮，就是对社会主义革命多一分贡献。”
