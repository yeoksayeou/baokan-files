	Promote the Party's Style of Close Ties with the Masses

	Chairman Mao teaches us: We must trust the masses, rely on the masses, and respect the masses' spirit of initiative. By relying on the masses, we achieve victory in all things.

	The personnel from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed at Beijing Railway Station and deputy head of the revolutionary committee, Wang Lianshan.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "What distinguishes our Party from all other political parties is that we have the closest ties with the broadest masses of the people." The practice of the Chinese revolution has repeatedly proven that as long as we follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, serve the people wholeheartedly, and maintain close ties with the masses, we can overcome all difficulties and defeat powerful enemies both at home and abroad, advancing from one victory to another.

	The Chinese Khrushchev, from his reactionary standpoint and counter-revolutionary needs, has always opposed and sabotaged our Party's fine tradition of close ties with the masses. He maliciously slanders workers as having "simple minds" and being like "wild horses" that will cause trouble if mobilized. Like all reactionary representatives in history, he regards the broad masses as ignorant "mob" and as "puppets" to be manipulated, as untrustworthy and unreliable. He advocates this reactionary "theory of the backwardness of the masses" to serve his counter-revolutionary line of bourgeois reaction, to promote the Kuomintang style, to suppress the masses, and to create counter-revolutionary public opinion; it is to seduce and corrupt Party members to separate them from the masses, to create a rift between the Party and the masses, thereby hiding his counter-revolutionary face and serving his restoration of capitalism. This reactionary fallacy must be thoroughly criticized and its poisonous influence completely eradicated.

	During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we went to Beijing Railway Station to support the left. When we followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, we encountered some difficulties. For example, Beijing Station handles tens of thousands of passengers daily, and the workers operate in three shifts, making it impossible to spare anyone at the moment. What should we do in such a situation? If we had listened to the Chinese Khrushchev's "theory of the backwardness of the masses" and treated the masses as "mob" and "puppets," then we few people would have locked ourselves in a room and racked our brains, which would definitely lead to wrong methods and wrong ideas. At that time, we thought of Chairman Mao's teachings: to trust the masses, rely on the masses, and respect the masses' spirit of initiative. I went deep into the passenger transport workshop, studied Chairman Mao's works with the revolutionary workers, worked and labored with them, and put the problem to the masses for discussion. The masses understand Chairman Mao's revolutionary line the deepest and follow his strategic deployment the closest. They demanded that the Mao Zedong Thought study classes be set up as soon as possible. Everyone contributed their ideas and determined a method: to draw one shift from the three shifts to participate in the study and to change the remaining two shifts into three shifts. This method was excellent and truly achieved the principle of revolution leading production. In a few days, study classes sprouted up like bamboo after a rain, appearing one after another in workshops and dormitories.

	In carrying out the revolutionary criticism and the cleansing of class ranks, some comrades had insufficient understanding of this struggle. To mobilize the masses deeply and to strike the class enemies steadily, accurately, and fiercely, I went to the baggage workshop and studied with everyone Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, repeatedly publicized the Party Central Committee's relevant policies and instructions, and had heart-to-heart talks. The masses, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, generated tremendous power, and everyone actively joined the struggle. Revolutionary workers, in light of the actual situation in their unit, laid bare the class struggle situation, exposed the sabotage activities of the class enemies, and criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents at Beijing Station. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, some class enemies who had been hidden for a long time and buried deeply were one by one exposed.

	The practice of revolutionary struggle made me further realize that "the masses are the real heroes." The broad revolutionary workers love Chairman Mao the most, listen to Chairman Mao's words the most, and understand Chairman Mao's revolutionary line the best. They are full of boundless revolutionary enthusiasm, infinite wisdom, and strength. The people nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought are the smartest, most talented, most daring in struggle, and most skillful in struggle. The Chinese Khrushchev's wild spread of the "theory of the backwardness of the masses," slandering the masses as "mob" and "puppets," only further exposes the Chinese Khrushchev's reactionary class nature.

	The practice of revolutionary struggle also made me deeply feel that the stronger the mass consciousness, the higher the awareness of the two-line struggle; the closer we rely on the masses, the deeper the understanding of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line; the closer we are to the masses, the closer we follow the great leader Chairman Mao. I am determined to follow Chairman Mao's earnest teachings, continue to promote our Party's fine tradition of close ties with the masses, forever believe in the masses, forever rely on the masses, respect the masses' spirit of initiative, and forever take root among the masses.

    发扬党的紧密联系群众的作风
    毛主席教导我们：要信任群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神。
    依靠群众事事得胜利
    解放军某部驻北京车站支左人员、革命委员会副主任  王连山
    毛主席教导我们：“我们共产党人区别于其他任何政党的又一个显著的标志，就是和最广大的人民群众取得最密切的联系。”我国革命实践一再证明，只要我们遵循伟大领袖毛主席的教导，全心全意为人民服务，和人民群众紧密地联系在一起，我们就能克服一切困难，战胜国内外强大的敌人，从胜利走向胜利。
    中国赫鲁晓夫出于他的反动立场和反革命的需要，一贯极力反对和破坏我们党的密切联系群众的优良作风。他恶毒地诬蔑工人“头脑简单”，“象野马一样，发动起来就会出乱子”。同历史上所有反动阶级的代表人物一样，他把广大群众看成是愚昧无知的“群氓”，任人摆布的“阿斗”，是不能相信、不可依靠的。他鼓吹这种反动的“群众落后”论，就是为他推行资产阶级反动路线，大搞国民党作风，镇压群众制造反革命舆论；就是要诱骗和腐蚀党员脱离群众，制造党和群众的分离，借以隐藏他的反革命面目，为他复辟资本主义效劳。这种反动谬论一定要彻底批判并肃清其流毒。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们来到北京车站支左。当我们紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，大办特办毛泽东思想学习班时，曾遇到一些困难。例如，北京站一天要迎送成千上万的旅客，职工工作是“三班制”，一时抽不出人来，应该怎么办？面对这样的问题，如果我们听信中国赫鲁晓夫的“群众落后”论，把群众当作“群氓”“阿斗”，那末我们几个人就会关在屋子里冥思苦想，这样一定要产生错办法和错主意。当时，我们就想到毛主席的教导，要相信群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神。我就深入到客运车间，和广大革命职工一起学习毛主席著作，一起生产劳动，并把问题交给群众讨论。群众对毛主席的革命路线理解最深，对毛主席的战略部署跟得最紧。他们要求赶快把毛泽东思想学习班办起来。大家献计献策，确定了一个办法：从三班中抽出一班来专门参加学习，将其余的两班变成三班。这个办法好极了，真正做到了革命统帅生产。不几天，学习班如雨后春笋，联翩出现，班（组）、车间办，职工宿舍也办。
    在开展革命大批判和清理阶级队伍中，有些同志对这场斗争认识不足。为了深入发动群众，稳、准、狠地打击阶级敌人，我来到行李车间，和大家共同学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的论述，反复宣传党中央有关方针、政策和指示，一起谈心。群众掌握了毛泽东思想就产生巨大的力量，大家都积极投入斗争。革命职工对照本单位实际，大摆阶级斗争形势，大摆阶级敌人的破坏活动，大批中国赫鲁晓夫及其在北京站的代理人所推行的反革命修正主义黑货。在毛主席一系列最新指示指引下，一些藏得很久、埋得很深的阶级敌人，一个个被揪出来了。
    革命斗争的实践，使我进一步认识到“群众是真正的英雄”。广大革命职工最热爱毛主席，最听毛主席的话，最理解毛主席的革命路线。他们中蕴藏着极大的革命积极性，蕴藏着无穷无尽的智慧和力量。毛泽东思想哺育下的人民群众，最聪明，最有才能，最敢于斗争，最善于斗争。中国赫鲁晓夫大肆散布“群众落后”论，诬蔑群众是“群氓”，是“阿斗”，只是更加清楚地暴露中国赫鲁晓夫的反动的阶级本性。
    革命斗争的实践，还使我深切地体会到，群众观念越强，两条路线斗争的觉悟就越高；靠群众越近，对毛主席革命路线理解就越深；和群众越亲，跟伟大领袖毛主席就越紧。我决心遵照毛主席的谆谆教导，继续发扬我们党的紧密联系群众的优良作风，永远相信群众，永远依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神，永远扎根在群众之中。
