Dear Chairman Mao, workers forever loyal to you!

Editor,

Just as the nation rejoices at the publication of Chairman Mao's latest directive, our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin have received representatives of the proletariat of our capital. This is the greatest happiness for the proletariat. We shout a thousand and ten thousand times: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Chairman Mao, long live forever!"

Chairman Mao profoundly pointed out: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully bring into play the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in all work. The working class must also continuously raise its political consciousness in the course of struggle."

Chairman Mao's latest directive is the greatest concern, the greatest trust, the greatest encouragement, and the greatest spur for the proletariat! In the new historical conditions, Chairman Mao has once again pointed out the leading role of the proletariat in the revolutionary process, entrusting the proletariat with a great historical mission! Chairman Mao's latest directive is the battle program, the guide to action, and the guarantee of victory for us to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

Chairman Mao supports us, and we must make Chairman Mao proud! Reflecting on the practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past two years, the revolutionary masses of our factory, following Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, have played a leading role, overcome one difficulty after another, broken through one storm after another, and achieved one great victory after another. Practice has proven the correctness and greatness of Chairman Mao's wise judgment. At the moment when Chairman Mao's latest directive is published, we hold the red revolutionary treasure book with boundless excitement and solemnly vow before Chairman Mao's portrait: "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! We must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have a line in our minds—the line of class struggle, have a path in our eyes—the revolutionary path indicated by you, and have a guideline in our hearts—the proletarian revolutionary line of you."

We resolutely unite with the broad masses of workers and revolutionary people throughout the nation, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, earnestly study, deeply understand, and resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's latest directive, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasp the direction of struggle, and always direct the spearhead of struggle against the handful of capitalist roaders, traitors, spies, and all counter-revolutionaries headed by China's Khrushchev. Thoroughly criticize the reactionary "multi-center" theory, closely unite around the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, under the command of the proletarian headquarters, unify our thinking, unify our steps, and unify our actions to do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of our unit. Resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call to "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism," "support the army and love the people," and "grasp revolution and promote production, work, and preparedness for war." In the great storms of class struggle, temper ourselves into steadfast warriors who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, be the vanguard in struggling against selfishness, the pioneers in criticizing revisionism, do a good job in cleaning up the class ranks, and smash the enemy's plot to sabotage the proletarian headquarters, seizing a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!
