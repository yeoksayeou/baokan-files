    A great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line! The revolutionary committees of Yunnan Province and Kunming City were born in glory simultaneously!

    Over 400,000 military and civilian personnel gathered in Kunming to celebrate. They enthusiastically shouted, "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!" They resolved to unite even more closely around the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, to thoroughly criticize the reactionary "multi-center theory," and under the command of the proletarian headquarters, to unify their thinking, steps, and actions. They vowed to shatter the schemes of the class enemy who dared to sabotage the proletarian headquarters and to seize a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution.

    Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, August 14th: Under the wise leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, under the close care of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, guided by Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and in the new revolutionary high tide of the Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary committees of Yunnan Province and Kunming City were born in glory amidst the stormy class struggle on the southwestern frontier of our motherland and the frontline of the anti-American struggle!

    This is a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and a great achievement of the revolutionary masses of Yunnan Province and the broad revolutionary masses who have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. It is a result of their heroic struggle against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, including China's Khrushchev, and their agents in Yunnan. It is also a great achievement of the "three supports, two militaries" work of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Yunnan.

    The birth of the Yunnan Provincial Revolutionary Committee marks the complete failure of China's Khrushchev and his agents' plot to restore capitalism in Yunnan. It signifies the further consolidation and strengthening of the proletarian dictatorship in China's southwestern frontier. This is a heavy blow to American imperialism, modern revisionism, and domestic and foreign class enemies, and a powerful support for the heroic people of Vietnam who are fighting against American aggression and for national salvation. This great victory will inspire the hundreds of millions of military and civilian personnel across the country to unite even more closely around the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, to advance victoriously, and to seize a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution.

    Our great leader Chairman Mao has, at every crucial moment in the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, given the revolutionary people of Yunnan the most timely and wise instructions. Under the great call of Chairman Mao's "Bombard the Headquarters" and guided by his series of wise instructions, the revolutionary masses of the province and the revolutionary masses of all ethnic groups have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. They have held high the banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries" and launched a sustained and fierce attack on China's Khrushchev and his agents in Yunnan, such as the traitor, spy, and capitalist roader Yan Hongyan and Zhao Jianmin. After more than two years of fierce struggle, the broad revolutionary masses have finally won a decisive victory in the Cultural Revolution and welcomed the birth of the new proletarian revolutionary power.

    The broad officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Yunnan have, in the Cultural Revolution, enthusiastically responded to the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao to "support the leftist broad masses." They have firmly stood on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, united with the broad revolutionary masses, fought together, and won together. They have undergone great tempering, and their awareness of the struggle between the two lines has greatly increased. In the "three supports, two militaries" work, they have done a lot of work and powerfully supported the Cultural Revolution of Yunnan, achieving great successes.

    On August 13th, the capital of Yunnan Province, Kunming City, was in a state of joy. Over 400,000 revolutionary masses of all ethnic groups, revolutionary Red Guards, and military personnel from all directions surged towards the meeting venue, enthusiastically celebrating the glorious birth of the revolutionary committees of Yunnan Province and Kunming City. They held high the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," carried the giant portrait of Chairman Mao, and sang revolutionary songs praising Chairman Mao. The broad military and civilian personnel resolutely declared that they would thoroughly criticize the reactionary bourgeois "multi-center theory" and, under the command of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, unify their will, steps, and actions to seize a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution!

    The meeting began with the majestic melody of "The East Is Red." When the meeting solemnly announced the glorious birth of the revolutionary committees of Yunnan Province and Kunming City, the entire venue was filled with the sound of drums and firecrackers, and the cheers were deafening. People excitedly shouted, "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line! Long live the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China! Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

    Comrade Tan Furen, the chairman of the Yunnan Provincial Revolutionary Committee, spoke at the celebration meeting. He said that the establishment of the revolutionary committees of Yunnan Province and Kunming City is a great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and a great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. It is a brilliant achievement of the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin.

    Comrade Tan Furen said that we must unite even more closely around the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, thoroughly criticize the reactionary "multi-center theory," and resolutely, under the command of the proletarian headquarters, unify our will, steps, and actions. We must strengthen the unity of the proletariat, strengthen revolutionary organizational discipline, and resolutely implement the various instructions of the proletarian headquarters. We must timely expose and shatter the schemes of a handful of class enemies who dare to sabotage the proletarian headquarters and the desperate struggles of a handful of class enemies. We must seize a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution.

    Comrade Tan Furen said that after the establishment of the revolutionary committee, the most important and fundamental task is to raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and to push the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the entire province to a new high tide. We must promote the ideological revolutionization of the people so that the 23 million revolutionary people of all ethnic groups in the province will forever be loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, forever loyal to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Comrade Tan Furen emphasized that loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao means to follow the instructions of Vice Chairman Lin, to read Chairman Mao's books for life, to listen to Chairman Mao's words, and to act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. We must act promptly and decisively on every instruction of Chairman Mao.

    Comrade Tan Furen said that Yunnan is located on the frontier of our motherland and is the southwestern bulwark against American imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and foreign reactionaries. It is the frontline of the struggle to aid Vietnam and resist America. The class struggle here has always been extremely sharp and complex. After the establishment of the Yunnan Provincial Revolutionary Committee, a handful of class enemies will inevitably continue to struggle desperately. We must follow Chairman Mao's teaching that "the rights obtained by the people must not be allowed to be easily lost and must be defended by struggle." We must further strengthen the proletarian dictatorship, strengthen the struggle against the enemy, thoroughly clean up the class ranks, and expose one by one the hidden traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist roaders, and other counter-revolutionaries. We must consolidate and develop the newly born revolutionary committee.

    Comrade Tan Furen said that the revolutionary people of the entire province and the broad officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army must cherish, trust, respect, support, help, and protect the revolutionary committee, making it continuously consolidated and improved. We must keep our eyes open, closely watch the new moves of the class enemy, expose and shatter the evil schemes of the class enemy who attempt to sabotage and overthrow the revolutionary committee, and consolidate and develop the revolutionary committee in the great storm of class struggle. We must deeply and persistently carry out the revolutionary criticism, sweep away the reactionary revisionist line advocated by China's Khrushchev and his agents in Yunnan. We must stay alert, strengthen our preparedness, and be ready at any time to shatter all provocations and invasions by imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries, to defend the southwestern frontier of our motherland, and to defend the Cultural Revolution.

    Comrade Tan Furen said that Chairman Mao teaches us: "The revolutionary committee should implement unified leadership, break up the overlapping administrative organs, streamline the bureaucracy, and organize a revolutionary leadership corps that is connected with the masses." We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, apply the glorious traditions and principles of political construction of the People's Liberation Army to the construction of the state power, and achieve the revolutionization of the leading cadres. We must carry forward the fine tradition of our Party of combining theory with practice, closely connecting with the masses, and criticizing and self-criticizing. We must forever believe in and rely on the masses, respect the creative spirit of the masses, fully mobilize the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses, and forever adhere to Chairman Mao's mass line, maintaining close ties with the masses, representing the interests of the masses, and serving the people wholeheartedly. We must build the revolutionary committee into a battle command post that raises high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizes proletarian politics, and leads the revolutionary masses in a fierce attack on the class enemy.

    Comrade Tan Furen also said that we must further implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, continue to consolidate and develop the great alliance and the three-in-one combination of the revolution, and guide all cross-industry mass organizations to the track of revolutionary great alliance by industry, by sector, and by class. We must do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of our own units. We must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's proletarian line of party building, rectify the party organization, and strengthen the construction of the party. We must further carry out the "support the army and love the people" movement, further implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness," strengthen socialist construction, develop socialist production, and seize a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution.

    Comrades Zhou Xing, the vice chairman of the Yunnan Provincial Revolutionary Committee and revolutionary leading cadre, and Chen Kang, the vice chairman of the Yunnan Provincial Revolutionary Committee and deputy commander of the Kunming troops, also spoke at the meeting. In their speeches, they expressed that they would raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They would unite even more closely under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, unify their will, steps, and actions with Mao Zedong Thought, strengthen the unity of the leading core of the revolutionary committee, strengthen the unity between the military and the people, and between the people of all ethnic groups. They would closely follow the strategic deployment of the great leader Chairman Mao, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and unshakably implement every strategic deployment and every battle command of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. They would further implement Chairman Mao's series of extremely important latest instructions and seize a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution.

    Comrade Duan Siying, the chairman of the Kunming City Revolutionary Committee, also spoke at the meeting.

    Representatives of revolutionary workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, and revolutionary Red Guards spoke one after another at the meeting. They expressed that they would, under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, unite even more closely, study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, and implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions without any discount. They would continue to focus on the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, strengthen the awareness of the enemy, unite as one, and fight against the enemy together. They would cherish the newly born revolutionary committee as they cherish their own eyes, develop and consolidate the great alliance and the three-in-one combination of the revolution, and do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their own units. They would further carry out the "support the army and love the people" movement, strengthen the unity between the military and the people, consolidate the border defense. They would vigorously grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness, and strive for a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution.

    Comrades Lu Ruilin, Liu Minghui, Huang Zaoqi, Li Yi, Xu Xuehui, and Duan Baozhen, vice chairmen of the Yunnan Provincial Revolutionary Committee, other leading members of the provincial and municipal revolutionary committees, and responsible comrades of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Yunnan attended the celebration meeting.

    四十多万军民在昆明集会庆祝，他们热烈欢呼：“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”决心更加紧密地团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部周围，彻底批判反动的“多中心论”，在无产阶级司令部的号令下，统一认识，统一步伐，统一行动，粉碎阶级敌人妄想破坏无产阶级司令部的阴谋诡计，夺取文化大革命的全面胜利
    新华社昆明十四日电　在伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的亲切关怀下，在毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，在无产阶级文化大革命运动的新的革命高潮中，祖国的西南边疆、反美斗争的前哨，传来了振奋人心的凯歌：云南省和昆明市革命委员会，在阶级斗争的急风暴雨中胜利诞生了！
    这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，是云南省无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，同中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在云南的代理人进行英勇斗争的伟大成果，是人民解放军驻云南部队“三支”“两军”工作的巨大成就。
    云南省革命委员会的光荣诞生，宣告了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在云南复辟资本主义的阴谋彻底破产，标志着我国西南边疆的无产阶级专政得到了进一步的巩固和加强。这是对美帝国主义、现代修正主义和国内外阶级敌人的沉重打击，是对正在进行抗美救国斗争的英雄的越南人民的有力支持。这一伟大胜利，必将鼓舞全国亿万军民更紧密地团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部周围，乘胜前进，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的每一个关键时刻，都给云南革命人民作了最及时、最英明的指示。全省无产阶级革命派和各族革命群众，在毛主席《炮打司令部》的伟大号召下，在毛主席一系列英明指示的指引下，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，高举“对反动派造反有理”的大旗，向中国赫鲁晓夫及其在云南的代理人阎红彦、赵健民等一小撮叛徒、特务、走资派，发动了持续的猛烈进攻。经过两年多的激烈搏斗，广大革命群众终于赢得了无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利，迎来了新的无产阶级革命政权的胜利诞生。
    人民解放军驻云南部队广大指战员，在无产阶级文化大革命中，热烈响应伟大领袖毛主席“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号召，坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，同广大革命群众团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起，受到了很大锻炼，两条路线斗争觉悟得到了很大提高。他们在“三支”“两军”工作中作了许多工作，有力地支持了云南的无产阶级文化大革命，取得了巨大的成就。
    八月十三日，云南省省会昆明市一片欢腾。各族无产阶级革命派、革命群众、革命的红卫兵小将和驻军指战员四十多万人，手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，抬着毛主席的巨幅画像，唱着歌颂毛主席的革命歌曲，从四面八方涌向大会会场，热烈庆祝云南省和昆明市革命委员会光荣诞生。广大军民坚决表示，一定要彻底批判反动的资产阶级的“多中心论”，在以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的号令下，统一意志，统一步伐，统一行动，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
    大会在雄壮的《东方红》乐曲声中开始。当大会庄严宣告云南省和昆明市革命委员会光荣诞生时，全场锣鼓喧天，鞭炮齐鸣，欢声雷动。人们激动地高呼：“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！”“伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党万岁！”“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    云南省革命委员会主任谭甫仁同志在庆祝大会上讲了话。他说，云南省和昆明市革命委员会的成立，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，是以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部英明领导的辉煌成果。

    谭甫仁同志说，云南地处祖国边疆，是反对美帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派斗争的西南屏障，是援越抗美斗争的前哨，历来阶级斗争极其尖锐复杂。云南省革命委员会成立之后，一小撮阶级敌人必然要继续作拚死挣扎。我们一定要遵照毛主席关于“人民得到的权利，绝不允许轻易丧失，必须用战斗来保卫”的教导，进一步加强无产阶级专政，加强对敌斗争，认真清理阶级队伍，把隐藏的叛徒、特务、死不改悔的走资派和其他反革命分子一个个地挖出来，巩固和发展新生的革命委员会。

    谭甫仁同志说，毛主席教导我们：“革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”我们一定要遵照毛主席的教导，把人民解放军的光荣传统和政治建军原则运用到政权建设中来，实现领导班子的革命化。要发扬我党理论联系实际、密切联系群众、批评和自我批评的优良作风。要永远相信和依靠人民群众，尊重群众的首创精神，充分发挥群众的革命积极性，永远坚持毛主席的群众路线，和群众保持血肉联系，代表群众的利益，全心全意为人民服务。我们一定要把革命委员会建设成为高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，率领革命群众向阶级敌人猛烈进攻的战斗指挥部。
    谭甫仁同志还说，我们一定要进一步落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，继续巩固和发展革命的大联合和革命的三结合，把一切跨行业的群众组织引向按系统、按行业、按班级实行革命大联合的轨道，搞好本单位的斗、批、改。要坚决贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级建党路线，整顿党的组织，加强党的建设。要进一步深入开展“拥军爱民”运动，进一步执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”的伟大方针，加强社会主义建设，发展社会主义生产，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
