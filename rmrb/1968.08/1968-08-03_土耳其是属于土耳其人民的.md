The waves of the Black Sea and the Mediterranean are surging and roaring. The anti-American struggle of the Turkish people has reached a new high. In mid-July, five warships of the U.S. Sixth Fleet docked at a Turkish port, immediately sparking the fury of the Turkish people, which erupted into a fierce and sustained mass anti-American struggle. Shouts of "Get out, you damned Americans!" "The Sixth Fleet, get out!" "Turkey wants independence!" echoed across the Turkish land. Under the angry protests of the Turkish people, the U.S. Sixth Fleet has already slunk away, but the anti-American struggle of the Turkish people continues to develop. This struggle fully reflects the firm anti-American and patriotic will of the Turkish people and the excellent situation of the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle of the Asian people.

Eight years ago, the anti-American storm of the Turkish people toppled the old puppet of American imperialism, Menderes, shook the imperialist bloc led by the United States, and demonstrated the great revolutionary power of the Turkish people. Since then, the Turkish people have relentlessly launched waves of anti-American struggles. This year, Turkey has seen a series of massive revolutionary mass movements, including demands to withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, reform the education system, and expel the U.S. aggression fleet, all aimed at the mortal enemy of the Turkish people, American imperialism, and its agents.

The facts clearly show that the just struggle of the Turkish people is indomitable by any reactionary forces. No matter what kind of agents American imperialism changes in Turkey, no matter what brutal suppression methods it adopts, it cannot intimidate the brave Turkish people. As long as the aggressive forces of American imperialism do not withdraw from Turkey, as long as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization still binds Turkey, and as long as Turkey has not achieved true independence and freedom, the anti-American struggle of the Turkish people will never stop and will inevitably surge forward.

The continuous rise of the storm of struggle in Turkey indicates that the new colonial system established by American imperialism in Asia is rapidly collapsing. Look, in those Asian countries and regions where American military bases are scattered, a large number of American troops are stationed, and they are tightly bound by American aggressive military alliances or bilateral military treaties, the flames of anti-American struggle have already been ignited. The people of South Vietnam have beaten the vicious American imperialists to a pulp, exposing their paper tiger nature. The people of Thailand have taken up arms and are successfully waging an anti-American patriotic armed struggle. In Japan, which is under semi-military occupation by the United States, the waves of people's anti-American struggle rise and fall. In Turkey, a strategic stronghold of the United States in the Middle East and under strict U.S. control, the people have also risen up to launch a fierce attack on American imperialism. The living reality is not proof that the aggressive policy of American imperialism in Asia has suffered a shameful failure and will inevitably suffer a complete failure?

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out as early as the 1950s: "In the future, the world must be a world of the people, and each country must be managed by its own people, and it can no longer be a world where imperialism and its running dogs run rampant."

In the storm of anti-American struggle, the political awareness of the Turkish people has rapidly increased, and they have become stronger. In Turkey, the true power lies with the Turkish people, not American imperialism and the Turkish reactionaries. The Turkish people will ultimately become the true masters of Turkey.

Turkey belongs to the Turkish people. The entire Asia belongs to the Asian people. American imperialism must get out of Turkey! It must get out of Asia! It must get out of all the places it has invaded, controlled, and occupied!

　　土耳其是属于土耳其人民的
　　本报评论员
    黑海和地中海的怒涛汹涌澎湃，土耳其人民的反美斗争出现了新的高涨。七月中旬美国第六舰队的五艘军舰开到土耳其港口，立即激起了土耳其人民的怒火，爆发成了一场猛烈而持久的群众性反美斗争。“讨厌的美国佬，滚回去！”“第六舰队，滚蛋！”“土耳其要独立！”等吼声响彻在土耳其的大地。在土耳其人民的愤怒抗议声中，美国第六舰队已经灰溜溜地滚蛋了，可是土耳其人民的反美斗争还在继续发展中。这场斗争，充分地反映了土耳其人民反美爱国的坚强意志和亚洲人民反帝革命斗争的大好形势。
    八年以前，土耳其人民的反美大风暴，曾经推倒了美帝国主义的老牌傀儡曼德列斯，震撼了以美国为首的帝国主义集团，显示了土耳其人民的巨大革命力量。在这之后，土耳其人民前赴后继，不断地掀起了反美斗争的浪潮。今年以来，土耳其先后爆发了要求退出北大西洋侵略集团，要求改革教育制度和驱逐美国侵略舰队等等的声势浩大的革命群众运动，其矛头都指向土耳其人民的死敌美帝国主义及其代理人。
    事实清楚地表明，土耳其人民的正义斗争是任何反动势力所摧不倒、压不垮的。美帝国主义在土耳其不管改换什么样的代理人，不管采取何等残暴的镇压手段，都无法吓倒英勇的土耳其人民。只要美帝国主义侵略势力一天不滚出土耳其，北大西洋公约组织一天还捆绑着土耳其，只要土耳其一天还没有获得真正的独立和自由，土耳其人民的反美斗争就决不会终止，而且必然要一浪高一浪地向前发展。
    土耳其人民斗争风暴的不断兴起，表明了美帝国主义在亚洲建立起来的新殖民体系，正在迅速崩溃。请看，遍布美国军事基地、驻有大量美军、并且被美国的侵略性军事集团或双边军事条约紧紧捆住手脚的那些亚洲国家和地区，都已燃烧起了反美斗争的熊熊烈火。南越人民把穷凶极恶的美帝国主义打得落花流水，使它现出了纸老虎的原形。泰国人民拿起了武器，胜利地展开着反美爱国武装斗争。处于美国半军事占领状态的日本，人民反美斗争的浪潮此伏彼起。美国在中东的战略要地、受美国严密控制的土耳其，那里的人民也起来向着美帝国主义发动猛烈的进攻。活生生的现实难道不是证明，美帝国主义在亚洲的侵略政策已经遭到可耻的破产，并且必将遭到彻底的破产吗？
    我们伟大的导师毛主席早在二十世纪五十年代就已指出：“今后的世界必须是人民的世界，世界各国必须由各国人民自己管理自己，而决不能再是帝国主义及其走狗横行霸道的世界了。”
    土耳其人民在反美斗争的风暴中，政治觉悟有了迅速提高，锻炼得更加坚强了。在土耳其，真正有力量的是土耳其人民，而决不是美帝国主义和土耳其反动派。土耳其人民终将成为主宰土耳其命运的真正的主人。
    土耳其是属于土耳其人民的。整个亚洲是属于亚洲人民的。美帝国主义必须从土耳其滚出去！必须从亚洲滚出去！必须从它侵略、控制和霸占的一切地方滚出去！
