Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," the situation on the industrial and transportation front in Jilin Province is excellent, and production has increased significantly.

Since this year, the total industrial output value of the province has been rising steadily, with each month surpassing the previous one and each quarter surpassing the previous one. In the second quarter, the total industrial output value increased by 44 percent compared to the first quarter. Based on the great victories achieved in the first half of the year, industrial production in July also saw a significant increase. The production and power generation of major industrial products such as automobiles, tractors, electric motors, agricultural machinery, coal, steel, cement, carbide, timber, and paper have all increased significantly. Daily necessities such as rubber shoes, soap, medicine, radios, sewing machines, bicycles, matches, light bulbs, and food not only increased in production but also in variety, promoting market prosperity. The railway transportation tasks of the entire province have also been well completed.

Under the leadership of revolutionary committees at various levels and with the enthusiastic help of the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams, the broad revolutionary workers on the industrial and transportation front in Jilin Province have closely united around the headquarters of the proletarian revolution led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. They have followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and carried out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism. Broad revolutionary workers, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, have turned workshops and teams into battlefields, thoroughly criticizing and exposing the "class struggle extinction" theory, "exploitation is beneficial," "material incentives," "experts running factories," and "business first" and other series of counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods spread by Chinese Khrushchev and his agents on the industrial and transportation front. Broad revolutionary workers have closely combined revolutionary criticism with the work of cleaning up class ranks, and hidden class enemies have been one by one exposed.

In the struggle, the broad revolutionary workers have greatly heightened their proletarian consciousness and awareness of the two-line struggle. Many constraints on workers' production enthusiasm imposed by revisionist rules and regulations have been broken by revolutionary workers, many things that were previously considered impossible have now been achieved, and some production bottlenecks that have long been unbroken have now been broken through, with new products, new technologies, and new creations emerging continuously. Many industrial and mining enterprises are flourishing with revolutionary and productive vigor.

The ship sails with the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. In the struggle to grasp revolution and promote production, the broad revolutionary workers on the industrial and transportation front in Jilin Province have extensively and deeply carried out the "three loyalties" activity of being loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. With deep proletarian feelings of boundless love and loyalty to Chairman Mao, they eagerly study and apply Chairman Mao's works. Various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes are becoming more and more numerous and better organized. Not only factories, workshops, and teams organize them, but many workers' families also do.

Many revolutionary committees in industrial and mining enterprises, following Chairman Mao's teachings on "being both an official and a common person," have carried forward the Party's fine tradition of closely linking with the masses. They have gone deep into the front lines of class struggle and production struggle, studying, laboring, criticizing and reforming, and promoting revolution and production together with the worker masses. They have fully played the role of the revolutionary committee as a fighting command center, making the revolution vigorous and production booming.

    吉林工交战线革命生产双胜利
    广大革命职工紧密团结在无产阶级司令部周围，抓革命，促生产。他们打破修正主义的条条框框，突破长期没有突破的生产关键，新产品新工艺新创造不断出现，生产总值直线上升
    新华社长春十八日电　在毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针的指引下，吉林省工业交通战线形势大好，生产大幅度上升。
    今年以来，全省工业生产总值直线上升，一月超过一月，一季胜过一季。第二季度，工业总产值比头一个季度增长了百分之四十四。在上半年获得巨大胜利的基础上，七月份的工业生产又有大幅度增长。汽车、拖拉机、电机、农机具、煤炭、钢铁、水泥、电石、木材、纸等主要工业产品的产量和发电量都大幅度上升。一些日用工业品，如胶鞋、肥皂、医药、收音机、缝纫机、自行车、火柴、灯泡和食品等不仅产量大幅度增长，而且花样品种增多，促进了市场的繁荣。全省的铁路交通运输任务也完成得很好。
    吉林省工业交通战线的广大革命职工在各级革命委员会的领导下，在人民解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的热情帮助下，紧紧地团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部周围，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，深入持久地开展革命大批判。广大革命职工以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，把车间、班组当战场，狠揭深批中国赫鲁晓夫及其在工交战线的代理人散布的“阶级斗争熄灭”论、“剥削有功”、“物质刺激”、“专家办厂”、“业务挂帅”等一系列反革命修正主义黑货。广大革命职工把革命大批判和清理阶级队伍的工作紧密地结合起来，暗藏的阶级敌人，一个个被挖了出来。
    广大革命职工在斗争中，大大提高了无产阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟。过去许多束缚工人生产积极性的修正主义的条条框框已被革命职工打破，许多原来认为办不到的事情现在办到了，一些原来长期没有突破的生产关键，现在突破了，新产品、新工艺、新创造不断出现。许多工矿企业革命、生产出现一片蓬蓬勃勃的气象。
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。在抓革命、促生产的斗争中，吉林省工业交通战线的广大革命职工广泛深入地开展了无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的“三忠于”活动、他们怀着对毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚的深厚无产阶级感情，如饥似渴地活学活用毛主席著作。各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班越办越多，越办越好。不仅工厂办、车间办、班组办，而且许多工人家庭也办。
    许多工矿企业革命委员会的新老干部遵照毛主席关于“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”的教导，发扬我党紧密联系群众的优良作风，深入阶级斗争和生产斗争第一线，和工人群众同学习，同劳动，同斗私批修，同抓革命、促生产，充分发挥了革命委员会的战斗指挥部的作用，使革命轰轰烈烈，生产热气腾腾。
