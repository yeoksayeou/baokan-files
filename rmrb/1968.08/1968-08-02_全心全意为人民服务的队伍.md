On the banks of the Tiekes River in Tiekes County, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, there is a unit of the People's Liberation Army. This unit has shown great concern for the local people, appearing wherever there is difficulty and forging a deep bond with the local people. Recently, six communes in Tiekes County have successively established revolutionary committees. On the day of celebrating the birth of the revolutionary committees, farmers and herdsmen from more than ten ethnic groups along the Tiekes River praised this unit for its new achievements during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Since the start of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a small handful of class enemies in this county incited some rural cadres to lie down and do nothing, attempting to sabotage production and thereby sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and herdsmen took up the heavy responsibility of combining revolution with production, engaging in a head-on struggle with the handful of class enemies. At this critical moment, this unit stepped forward, sending Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to various communes to arm, educate, and organize the masses with the brilliant thoughts of Mao Zedong, greatly encouraging the local revolutionary people.

The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams sent to the communes were warmly welcomed by the local poor and lower-middle peasants and herdsmen. The propaganda team sent to the Second Commune helped the poor and lower-middle peasants and herdsmen establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes upon arrival. In the study class, the team leader Xiao Faqiang, following Chairman Mao's latest instructions, first guided everyone to investigate and analyze the activities of the class enemies, distinguish between the two types of contradictions, unite all possible forces, and be ruthless to the enemy but lenient to oneself. There was a deputy secretary in the commune who had many shortcomings and errors in his past work. Everyone gave him a lot of criticism, but he was not enlightened and had a confrontational attitude towards the masses. Xiao Faqiang had several talks with him, patiently enlightening and helping him, encouraging him to bravely stand up for the revolution. With the help of the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team, this deputy secretary made a fairly deep self-criticism to the masses, gained their understanding, and participated in the revolutionary three-in-one combination. Because the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team helped everyone grasp Chairman Mao's theory, line, principles, and policies on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, learn to observe and analyze problems with Mao Zedong Thought, and raise their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, the two factions in the commune quickly united, creating a new situation and a new atmosphere for the commune's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Over the past few months, the propaganda teams sent by this unit have established one Mao Zedong Thought study class after another, from the fields and farmlands to the sheep pens and pastures, wherever there are commune members, they establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Wherever Mao Zedong Thought study classes are established, the spiritual face of the farmers and herdsmen changes greatly. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and herdsmen, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, have carried out extensive and in-depth revolutionary criticism, sweeping away the various poisons of the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, and significantly raising their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. The good revolutionary situation has promoted the agricultural and pastoral production of the entire county. Currently, the crops in the entire county are growing well, and the livestock industry is thriving.

　　全心全意为人民服务的队伍
    新疆维吾尔自治区特克斯河畔的特克斯县，驻着人民解放军的一支部队。这支部队给了当地人民无微不至的关怀，哪里有困难他们就出现在哪里，同当地人民群众结下了血肉的友谊。最近，特克斯县六个公社相继成立了革命委员会。在欢庆革命委员会诞生的日子里，特克斯河两岸十几个民族的贫下中农和劳动牧民，热烈赞扬这支部队在无产阶级文化大革命中立下的新功。
    无产阶级文化大革命开始以后，这个县的一小撮阶级敌人，挑动农村一些干部躺倒不干，企图以破坏生产来破坏无产阶级文化大革命。广大贫下中农和劳动牧民，奋起挑起抓革命促生产的重担，同一小撮阶级敌人进行了针锋相对的斗争。就在这关键时刻，这支部队挺身而出，向各个公社派出了毛泽东思想宣传队，用光芒四射的毛泽东思想去武装群众、宣传群众、组织群众，给了当地革命人民以极大的鼓舞。
    派到各公社的毛泽东思想宣传队，受到当地贫下中农和劳动牧民的热烈欢迎。派到二公社的毛泽东思想宣传队，一到公社就帮助贫下中农和劳动牧民办起了毛泽东思想学习班。学习班上，宣传队的负责人肖法刚遵照毛主席的一系列最新指示，首先引导大家调查和分析阶级敌人的活动情况，分清两类不同性质的矛盾，团结一切可以团结的力量，做到对敌狠，对己和。公社有个副书记，过去工作中存在不少缺点和错误，大家给他提了不少意见，但他思想上一时不通，同群众产生了对立情绪。肖法刚就接连找他谈话，耐心地启发他、帮助他，鼓励他勇敢地站出来革命。在毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，这个副书记向群众作了比较深刻的检查，得到了群众的谅解，参加了革命的三结合。由于毛泽东思想宣传队帮助大家掌握了毛主席关于在无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，学会了用毛泽东思想观察和分析问题，提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，公社的两派很快就联合了起来，使公社的无产阶级文化大革命开创了新局面，出现了新气象。
    几个月来，这支部队派出的毛泽东思想宣传队，办起了一期期毛泽东思想学习班，从田间、地头到羊圈、牧场，哪里有社员，就在哪里办毛泽东思想学习班，哪里办起了毛泽东思想学习班，哪里的农牧民精神面貌就大大变样。广大贫下中农和劳动牧民，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，广泛深入地开展革命的大批判，肃清中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义路线的种种流毒，阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟有了明显提高。大好的革命形势推动着全县的农牧业生产，目前全县农作物长势极好，畜牧业欣欣向荣。
