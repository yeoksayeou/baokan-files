	Resolutely Execute the Orders of the Proletarian Headquarters
	Chen Huiguang, 602 Boat, East China Sea Fleet

	Just as the people of the entire nation were enthusiastically celebrating the two-week anniversary of the grand program of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally formulated by Chairman Mao, the "Sixteen Points," we received the joyous news that our most beloved and respected Great Leader Chairman Mao had passed on the precious gift of mangos, presented to him by foreign friends, to the Capital Workers and Peasants Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team. We, the naval soldiers stationed thousands of miles away from the capital, share in this great happiness and cannot help but raise our fists and shout, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!"

	The heavens and the earth are not as great as Chairman Mao's grace. Parents are not as dear as Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao is the confidant of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. He cares for the people, believes in the people, and respects the people's pioneering spirit, always keeping his heart connected with ours.

	Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. The proletarian headquarters, led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, most concentratedly represents the fundamental interests of the proletariat and the revolutionary people. It is the sole leadership center for the entire Party, the entire military, the entire nation, and the revolutionary masses. Resolutely executing the orders of the proletarian headquarters, led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, is the fundamental guarantee for achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It is the highest duty of every revolutionary.

	Last summer, at the moment when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution entered a great struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads, we received the order from the proletarian headquarters to stand by at sea, ready to strike at the enemy's sabotage plots and defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. At that time, it was the hottest period of summer, and the weather was extremely hot. Comrades were soaked in sweat all day. The engine room soldiers operated the machinery in the engine room where the temperature reached forty to fifty degrees Celsius. The artillery soldiers sat under the scorching sun on their gun positions. Freshwater supply at sea was also difficult, with each person getting only two cups of water per day. Comrades could not eat well or sleep well, and their physiques became increasingly thin. Additionally, with strong winds and high waves, many comrades suffered from seasickness and vomiting. However, when everyone thought about this being the glorious mission given to us by Chairman Mao, an order from the proletarian headquarters, they showed unparalleled resolve. Everyone thought of Chairman Mao, and no matter how hard or tired they were, they felt no hardship or fatigue. One day, the people on a nearby island saw that we had been standing by for a long time and voluntarily brought us some freshwater in a small boat. However, no one among the comrades dared to use a drop of it, and in the end, the freshwater was poured into the water tank. Everyone said, "To execute Chairman Mao's orders, we must plan for the long term. It's okay if people are thirsty, but if the machinery is 'thirsty,' it cannot rotate and cannot fulfill its duty to defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." During one sea patrol, the winds and waves were very large. The navigator, Lou Jinmu, suffered from seasickness and vomited repeatedly, but he shouted, "Defend Chairman Mao, defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" and did not retreat from his post even a step. In this way, we stood by at sea for nineteen consecutive days. Without the order from the proletarian headquarters, not a single comrade thought of returning.

	We firmly believe that as long as we resolutely execute the orders of the proletarian headquarters, led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, we will definitely be victorious. At this moment, when we are striving for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we need even more absolute loyalty to the proletarian headquarters, led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. We must strive to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, link theory with practice, and put what we learn into practice. We guarantee to do the following: For the orders, decisions, policies, and lines of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, we will execute those we understand and also execute those we temporarily do not understand, deepening our understanding in the process of execution. We will thoroughly criticize and expose the reactionary "multi-center theory" of the bourgeoisie and timely uncover the plots of a handful of class enemies attempting to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Under the command of the proletarian headquarters, we will unite our will, unite our steps, and unite our actions to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	All representatives attending the Second Beijing Artillery Active Learners and Appliers of Mao Zedong Thought Conference enthusiastically welcomed the great leader Chairman Mao's gift to the Capital Workers and Peasants Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team. This is them discussing this great piece of news. Photographed by the Beijing Artillery Reporting Team.

### 坚决执行无产阶级司令部的命令

　　坚决执行无产阶级司令部的命令
　　东海舰队某部六零二艇　陈辉群
    正当全国亿万军民热烈庆祝毛主席亲自主持制定的无产阶级文化大革命的宏伟纲领——“十六条”发表两周年前夕，听到了我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席将外国朋友赠送给他老人家的珍贵礼物——芒果，转送给首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队这个特大喜讯。我们远离首都千万里的海防战士，分享着这个巨大的幸福，情不自禁地振臂高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”
    天大地大没有毛主席的恩情大，爹亲娘亲没有毛主席亲。毛主席是我们工农兵的贴心人，他老人家最最关心群众，相信群众，尊重群众的首创精神，永远和我们心连心。
    毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，最集中地代表了无产阶级和广大革命人民群众的最根本利益，是全党、全军、全国和广大革命群众唯一的领导中心。坚决执行以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的命令，是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的根本保证，是我们每一个革命者的最高职责。
    去年夏天，正当无产阶级文化大革命进入两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线大搏斗的时刻，我们奉无产阶级司令部的命令，在海上待机，随时准备打击敌人的破坏阴谋，保卫无产阶级文化大革命。当时，正是盛夏三伏，天气酷热，同志们整天泡在汗水里。轮机兵在气温高达四、五十度的轮机舱里操纵着机器，枪炮兵头顶烈日烤晒，端坐在炮位上。海上淡水供应又很困难，每天每人只有两杯水，同志们吃不好，睡不香，体质日见消瘦，加上风大浪高，很多同志晕船呕吐。但是，当大家想到这是毛主席交给我们的光荣任务，是执行无产阶级司令部的命令时，就表现出无比的毅力。大家一想到毛主席，就再苦不觉苦，再累不知累。有一天，附近岛上的群众看我们待机的时间很长，主动地用小舢板给我们送来了一点淡水，可是同志们谁也舍不得用一点，最后把淡水倒进了水柜。大家说：“为了执行毛主席的命令，我们要作长期打算，人渴一点不要紧，机器‘渴’了就不能打转，就不能担负起保卫无产阶级文化大革命的职责。”一次海上巡逻，风浪很大，航海兵楼金木晕船，吐了又吐，他高呼着：保卫毛主席，保卫无产阶级文化大革命！硬是不从战位后退一步。就这样，我们一连在海上待机十九天。没有无产阶级司令部的命令，没有一个同志想到返航。
    我们坚信：只要我们坚决执行以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的命令，我们就一定胜利。当前，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的时刻，我们更需要对以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的绝对忠诚，努力活学活用毛泽东思想，理论联系实际，学了就用。我们保证做到：对毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的命令、决策、方针、路线，理解的坚决执行，暂时不理解的也要坚决执行，在执行中加深理解。彻底批臭反动的资产阶级的“多中心论”，及时识破一小撮阶级敌人企图破坏无产阶级文化大革命的阴谋诡计，在无产阶级司令部的号令下，统一意志，统一步伐，统一行动，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。（附图片）
