Refunding the Grass Money

The poor and lower-middle peasants of the Laohubei Brigade criticized the "currency first" policy of the Chinese Khrushchev and refunded the excess money received for selling high-priced grass to brother production brigades.

Gao Huanjun is the director of the militia company in Laohubei Brigade, Chongli County, Hebei Province. This 19-year-old female warrior, who emerged during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, has been a standing committee member of the Zhangjiakou Revolutionary Committee since last December. She is always covered in dirt on sunny days and mud on rainy days, fighting against the heavens and the earth, and against the enemy with a red heart, a brave spirit, and a strong will. She closely follows the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao and works hard on the struggle, criticism, and transformation.

One day, after Gao Huanjun returned from an outing, someone told her: "Recently, a few production brigades sold high-priced grass. This is a major issue related to the struggle between the two lines, and it must be resolved." Gao Huanjun said, "Yes! Selling grass for a few more fen per catty is a small matter, but taking the capitalist road is a big deal! In the past, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in this county promoted the idea of 'currency first, dividends first.' Today, someone is selling high-priced grass, which shows that the revisionist poison of the Chinese Khrushchev has not been completely eliminated. We must deeply criticize the revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev and thoroughly eliminate his poison."

"Setting up a study class is a good idea. Many problems can be solved in the study class." With the enthusiastic help of the military personnel assisting in agriculture, each production brigade held a Mao Zedong Thought study class. In her own brigade's study class, Gao Huanjun discovered that some members had been deeply poisoned by the idea of 'dividends first.' They started from the bourgeois 'self' and believed that since the grass had already been sold, the money did not need to be refunded. If one is willing to sell and the other is willing to buy, it is legal. In response to these active thoughts, she first, on behalf of all the brigade cadres, examined herself for not being close enough to the masses and not timely discovering and stopping the sale of high-priced grass. This is a lesson in the lack of awareness of the struggle between the two lines. Then, she and everyone studied the "Three Constantly Read Articles" together, guiding everyone to compare themselves with the three shining examples of Zhang Zedong, Norman Bethune, and the Old Man of the Mountain, to find the root cause, discuss the harm, find the gap, and make plans. In this way, the poor and lower-middle peasants' awareness of the struggle between the two lines was greatly improved.

Recently, at the "Criticize Self, Criticize Revisionism" experience exchange meeting held by the commune, the representatives of the poor and lower-middle peasants of Laohubei Brigade refunded all the excess money received for selling high-priced grass to the brother production brigades. This spirit deeply moved the brother production brigades.

    退草钱
    老虎背大队贫下中农批判中国赫鲁晓夫“钞票挂帅”的流毒，把卖高价草多要的钱退给兄弟生产队
    高焕俊是河北省崇礼县老虎背大队民兵连指导员。这个在无产阶级文化大革命中英勇冲杀出来的十九岁的女闯将，去年十二月被选为张家口地区革命委员会常委以来，晴天一身土，雨天一身泥，战天斗地打敌人，心红胆壮骨更硬。她紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的伟大战略部署，认真搞好斗批改。
    一天，高焕俊外出回来，有人告诉她：最近有几个生产队卖了高价草，这是关系到两条道路斗争的大问题，必须解决好。高焕俊说：“对啊！一斤草多卖一、二分钱是小事，走资本主义的邪路可是大事啊！过去中国赫鲁晓夫以及在本县的代理人，大搞‘钞票挂帅，分红第一。’今天有人卖高价草，这说明中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义流毒还没肃清。必须深入展开对中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义路线的大批判，彻底肃清他的流毒。”
    “办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”在解放军支农人员的热情帮助下，各生产队办了一期毛泽东思想学习班。高焕俊在本队学习班里，发现个别社员受“分红第一”的毒害较深。他们从资产阶级的“私”字出发，认为草已经卖了，钱就不用再退了。一个愿卖，一个愿买，是合法的。针对这些活思想，她首先代表全大队干部向社员们检查了深入群众不够，没有及时发现和制止卖高价草的事，这是两条路线斗争觉悟不高的教训。接着，她和大家共同学习“老三篇”，引导大家对照张思德、白求恩、老愚公三个光辉形象，自觉找根源，论危害，找差距，订措施。这样一来，大大提高了贫下中农的两条路线斗争觉悟。
    最近，在公社举行的“斗私批修”经验交流大会上，老虎背的贫下中农代表把卖高价草多要的钱全部退给了兄弟生产队，他们这种精神，深深地感动了兄弟生产队。
