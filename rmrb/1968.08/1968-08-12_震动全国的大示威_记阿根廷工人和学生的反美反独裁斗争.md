On June 28, 1966, Argentine pro-American dictatorial military forces, backed by U.S. imperialism, staged a coup and seized power. Two years later on this very day, workers, students, and other sectors of the people throughout Argentina broke through the fascist terror rule, shouting slogans and taking to the streets, holding a nationwide protest against the pro-American dictatorship that shook the entire country.

The heroic struggle of Argentine workers and students dealt a heavy blow to the pro-American dictatorship, demonstrating the immense power of the Argentine people.

That evening, the capital, Buenos Aires, was under strict guard. Armored vehicles, gas dispersal equipment, cavalry units, thousands of plainclothes police, and radio-controlled cars were all deployed by the Onganía regime in an attempt to suppress the surging tide of the people's struggle. But this was a futile attempt.

At the 11th Square, designated as the gathering point for the protesters, despite the heavy police presence and blockades, hundreds of young people took coordinated action, shouting anti-dictatorship slogans, and managed to break through. They threw homemade bombs at jeeps, trucks, patrol cars, and tanks. Meanwhile, students from the Philosophy and Literature Faculty, the Economics Faculty, and railway workers, shouting slogans to defend the unity of workers and students and against military takeover of the railway union, broke through another part of the wide 11th Square.

In Córdoba, the clashes between protesters and police were intense. Reports indicated that in a district called Clainicas, workers and students smashed 300 streetlights to hinder police advances. Police attempted to use flares and cavalry first, followed by infantry supported by newly arrived police reinforcements. However, the repression forces were met with fierce resistance from rooftops, doorways, and street corners: homemade Molotov cocktails, iron bars, stones, and wooden planks flew through the air. The battle raged throughout the night until the morning of the 29th.

In Tucumán, sugar workers engaged in fierce hand-to-hand combat with the reactionary mounted police sent to suppress them. In the countryside of Tucumán Province, workers from several sugar mills simultaneously held protest marches.

In Salta, protesting workers overturned cars to create barricades and fought with the police for three hours.

In Mendoza, 500 armed police equipped with tear gas launchers and carbines, along with police dogs, charged at the advancing workers. The workers fought back in the streets for several hours.

In Rosario, Santa Fe Province, police barricades were repeatedly breached by determined workers and students. These workers and students, following a battle plan, divided into many small teams and marched in formation through various city blocks. The police's attacks were met with fierce resistance from the protesters, who threw homemade bombs and stones.

In this struggle, Argentine workers and students were tempered and gained experience. They are further deepening their anti-U.S., anti-dictatorship struggle.

　　震动全国的大示威
　　——记阿根廷工人和学生的反美反独裁斗争
    一九六六年六月二十八日，阿根廷亲美独裁军人在美帝国主义幕后支持下发动政变上了台。两年后的这一天，阿根廷全国工人、学生和其他阶层人民冲破了法西斯恐怖统治，高呼口号，涌上街头，举行了震动全国的反对亲美独裁统治的大示威。
    阿根廷工人和学生的这次英勇斗争，沉重地打击了亲美独裁政权，显示了阿根廷人民的强大力量。
    这一天晚上，首都布宜诺斯艾利斯市戒备森严。装甲车，施放瓦斯的设备，骑兵部队，成百上千的便衣警察，无线电指挥的汽车，都被翁加尼亚政权使用起来，企图压制广大人民的斗争浪潮。但这只是痴心妄想。
    在示威者选定为集合地点的第十一号广场，虽然警察严阵以待，重重封锁，但数百名青年采取一致行动，喊着反对亲美独裁者的口号，仍然从一角冲了进去。他们掷出土制炸弹，向吉普车、卡车、巡逻车和战车进攻。同时，哲学文学院、经济学院的学生和铁路工人，齐声高呼维护工人和学生团结、反对军事接管铁路工会的口号，突破了宽广的十一号广场的另一个地方。
    在科尔多瓦市，示威群众同警察的战斗非常激烈。据报道，在一个名叫克拉伊尼卡斯的市区，工人和学生砸坏了三百盏路灯，以阻止警察前进。警察设法就地放照明烟火，首先让骑兵冲上去，接着步兵在新调来的警察增援下跟着冲上去。但是镇压部队遭到来自屋顶、门廊和街口的猛烈反击：土制燃烧瓶、铁块、石子和木头在空中乱飞。斗争延续了一整夜，直到二十九日清晨。
    在图库曼市，糖业工人同前来镇压的反动骑警展开了激烈的肉搏战。在图库曼省内地，好几个糖厂工人都同时举行了示威游行。
    在萨尔塔市，示威工人翻倒汽车堆成街垒，与警察搏斗了三个小时。
    在门多萨市，配备毒瓦斯投射器和卡宾枪的五百名武装警察，牵着警犬，扑向工人的进军队伍。工人们在街道同警察战斗了好几小时。
    在圣菲省的罗萨利奥市，警察封锁线多次被斗志昂扬的工人和学生冲垮。这些工人和学生根据战斗计划分成许多小队，分别在市中心各个街区列队游行。警察的进攻遭到示威群众扔出的土制炸弹和石块的猛烈反击。
    阿根廷工人和学生在这次斗争中经受了锻炼，积累了经验。他们正在进一步深入地开展反美、反独裁的斗争。
