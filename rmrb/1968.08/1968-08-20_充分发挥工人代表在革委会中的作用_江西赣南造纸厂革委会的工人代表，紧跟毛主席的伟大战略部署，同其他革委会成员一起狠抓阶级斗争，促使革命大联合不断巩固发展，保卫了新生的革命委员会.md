Worker representatives in the Revolutionary Committee of the Gan'nan Paper Mill in Jiangxi have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. Together with other members of the Revolutionary Committee, they have vigorously carried out class struggle, promoted the consolidation and development of revolutionary great unity, and defended the newly established Revolutionary Committee.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Nanchang on the 19th, worker representatives in the Gan'nan Paper Mill Revolutionary Committee have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and displayed the resolute and thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat. In the various tasks since the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, they have played a powerful role, ensuring that the revolution and production in this mill are full of vitality and flourishing.

The great leader Chairman Mao recently instructed: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully bring into play the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in all work. The working class should also continuously raise its political consciousness in the struggle." When Chairman Mao's latest instructions reached the Gan'nan Paper Mill, the PLA support-left personnel stationed in the mill immediately helped the mill's Revolutionary Committee to hold a Mao Zedong Thought study class with the focus on studying and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, deciding to further bring into play the role of worker representatives in the Revolutionary Committee.

Worker representatives most listen to Chairman Mao's words and implement them most resolutely

Since the establishment of the Gan'nan Paper Mill Revolutionary Committee in November last year, in the nine-month struggle, worker representatives have shown their deepest class feelings of boundless love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao. They most listen to Chairman Mao's words. In September last year, after Chairman Mao's latest instructions on achieving revolutionary great unity were issued, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the Gan'nan Paper Mill closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and quickly achieved revolutionary great unity. However, due to the influence of erroneous ideas such as "putting oneself at the center" and factionalism, there was a period when great unity was not consolidated in thought, which brought obstacles to the revolution and production. The worker representatives in the Revolutionary Committee unanimously believed that Chairman Mao's instructions on "within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interests. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions" were words that spoke to the heart of the working class. We must resolutely implement them. They said: We should believe that the working masses are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and infinitely love Chairman Mao. They most listen to Chairman Mao's words. At the meeting, worker representatives also repeatedly studied with everyone the instructions of Vice Chairman Lin: "Our country is a great socialist country under the dictatorship of the proletariat with a population of 700 million. It needs a unified ideology, a revolutionary ideology, a correct ideology, which is Mao Zedong Thought." They suggested arming all revolutionary workers in the mill with Mao Zedong Thought, unifying understanding, unifying steps, and unifying actions. The Revolutionary Committee, based on the opinions of the worker representatives, immediately carried out extensive and in-depth political and ideological work among the working masses to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. In the workshops, in the dormitories, and in the study classes, revolutionary workers widely carried out heart-to-heart talks. Many workers who had grievances due to differing views during the Cultural Revolution quickly formed a "pair of reds." From then on, the political atmosphere in the mill became thicker, and revolutionary great unity was consolidated and developed in thought. The practice of struggle also made the worker representatives in the Revolutionary Committee more deeply realize that Chairman Mao's words are the truth. To make revolution, one must listen to Chairman Mao's words. Listening to Chairman Mao's words makes one clear-sighted and wise, leading with direction, and everything goes well; departing from Chairman Mao's instructions and the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin is departing from the truth, and there is no standard for judging right and wrong, leading to failure and going astray.

Worker representatives most love and most bravely defend the newly established Revolutionary Committee

The working class suffered the most oppression and hardship in the old society. They are most indignant towards capitalist-roaders and have the strongest revolutionary spirit; they most love and most bravely defend the newly established Revolutionary Committee. Therefore, in the struggle to build, consolidate, and develop the new proletarian revolutionary power, worker representatives have fully brought into play the leading role of the working class and fully demonstrated the great revolutionary spirit of daring to fight and daring to win.

Early this year, after the work of cleaning up class ranks was vigorously carried out in the mill, a counter-revolutionary two-faced person who had infiltrated the revolutionary mass organizations spread rumors and created divisions, formed factions, and attempted to sabotage and overthrow the newly established Revolutionary Committee, obstructing the implementation of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. As soon as this problem surfaced, the worker representatives in the mill Revolutionary Committee repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's great teachings on "the rights obtained by the people must not be easily lost and must be defended by struggle," immediately used Mao Zedong Thought to propagate, organize, and arm the masses, and led all the workers in the mill to expose and criticize the counter-revolutionary two-faced person's tricks. Worker representative and deputy director of the Revolutionary Committee, Zeng Guanghui, in order to expose the enemy and defend the newly established Revolutionary Committee, did not return home for days and nights, researching the enemy situation with the workers and writing criticism articles together. Under the leadership of the worker representatives, from young workers to elderly workers, from the families of the staff to the revolutionary teachers and students of the factory's children's school, everyone joined the battle to defend the newly established Revolutionary Committee, quickly exposing the counter-revolutionary two-faced person who had infiltrated the revolutionary mass organizations, and consolidating and developing the newly established Revolutionary Committee in the storm of struggle against the enemy.

Worker representatives most closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and have the most thorough revolutionary spirit

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "Only the working class has the farthest vision, is the most selfless, and is the most thorough in revolution." Many facts since the establishment of the Gan'nan Paper Mill Revolutionary Committee show that worker representatives most closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. They dare to think, dare to speak, dare to venture, and dare to act, daring to smash old forces and old systems, and boldly establish new orders and new customs, possessing a thorough revolutionary spirit.

As soon as the mill Revolutionary Committee was established, worker representatives, following Chairman Mao's teachings, worked with other members of the Revolutionary Committee to implement "streamlining administration and the military," reducing the three departments and seven sections of the old organization, totaling 89 cadres, to three offices with a total of 39 people, which was praised by the masses and higher leadership. Amidst the praise, some committee members became complacent. Later, the entire committee, under the leadership of the PLA support-left personnel stationed in the mill, visited Changgang Township in Xingguo County, where Chairman Mao had personally conducted investigations more than 30 years ago, learned about the fighting spirit of the cadres in the Soviet area at that time, and found the gaps in the work of the Revolutionary Committee. Everyone decided to further break away from the old organizational framework. Just at this time, the People's Daily published the experience and important editorial note of streamlining administration in Lingbao County, Henan Province. The worker representatives in the Revolutionary Committee, hearing the news, worked with other members of the Revolutionary Committee to seriously study and deeply understand, resolutely implementing it. Worker representatives in the Mao Zedong Thought study class took the lead in exposing and criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line that Liu Shaoqi promoted in the construction of power, finding the gaps between the mill Revolutionary Committee and the Lingbao County Revolutionary Committee, talking about the advantages and great significance of streamlining administration, and studying plans with the masses to further streamline the work organization of the Revolutionary Committee, changing the three offices into three groups, reducing the number of workers from 39 to 20.

Chairman Mao teaches: "The Revolutionary Committee should implement unified leadership, break down the overlapping administrative organizations, streamline administration, and organize a revolutionary and people-oriented leading cadre."

Worker representatives realized that to make the Revolutionary Committee revolutionary, not only must the personnel be streamlined, but also the old working style of being high above the masses must be thoroughly changed, going deep into reality, deep into the masses, and diligently reforming one's own thoughts, carrying out ideological revolutionization, and wholeheartedly serving the people. Based on the suggestions of the worker representatives, the Revolutionary Committee moved the office from the building to the workshop, so that the members and staff of the Revolutionary Committee could always maintain close contact with the masses. Now, the members of the Revolutionary Committee carry the red revolutionary classics with them every day, going to the workshops with the workers to study, criticize and transform themselves, labor, and research work together, making the revolution and production in the entire mill present a new look.

    充分发挥工人代表在革委会中的作用
    江西赣南造纸厂革委会的工人代表，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，同其他革委会成员一起狠抓阶级斗争，促使革命大联合不断巩固发展，保卫了新生的革命委员会
    据新华社南昌十九日电　赣南造纸厂革命委员会中的工人代表，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，发扬无产阶级的坚决彻底革命精神，在革委会成立后的各项工作中发挥了强有力的作用，保证了这个厂的革命和生产朝气蓬勃，蒸蒸日上。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近教导说：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”毛主席最新指示传到赣南造纸厂，解放军驻厂支左人员立即帮助厂革委会举办以学习落实毛主席最新指示为专题的毛泽东思想学习班，决定进一步发挥革委会中工人代表的作用。
        工人代表最听毛主席的话，贯彻
    毛主席的指示最坚决
    赣南造纸厂革委会从去年十一月成立到现在，在九个月来的战斗历程中，工人代表表现出他们对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚的最深厚的阶级感情，他们最听毛主席的话。去年九月，当毛主席关于实现革命大联合的最新指示传来以后，赣南造纸厂无产阶级革命派紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，迅速实现了革命大联合。可是，由于“以我为中心”和山头主义等错误思想的影响，一度出现大联合在思想上还不巩固的现象，给革命和生产带来了阻力。革委会中的工人代表一致认为，毛主席关于“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织”的指示，字字句句说出了工人阶级的心里话，我们必须坚决照办。他们说：我们应当相信工人群众无限忠于毛主席，无限热爱毛主席，他们最听毛主席的话。在会上，工人代表还和大家一遍又一遍地学习了林副主席的指示：“我国是一个伟大的无产阶级专政的社会主义国家，有七亿人口，需要有一个统一的思想，革命的思想，正确的思想，这就是毛泽东思想。”他们建议用毛泽东思想来武装全厂革命工人，统一认识，统一步伐，统一行动。革委会根据工人代表的意见，立即在工人群众中进行广泛深入的政治思想工作，落实毛主席的最新指示。在车间，在宿舍，在学习班里，革命职工们广泛展开了谈心活动。很多在文化大革命中因为观点不同而结下疙瘩的工人，很快地结成了“一对红”。从此，厂里的政治空气越来越浓厚，革命大联合从思想上得到了巩固和发展。斗争实践也使革委会中的工人代表更加深刻地认识到，毛主席的话就是真理，干革命就要听毛主席的话。听了毛主席的话，心明眼亮，领导有方，万事好办；离开了毛主席的指示，离开了以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的战斗号令，就是离开了真理，就没有判断是非的标准，就会一事无成，走上邪路。
        工人代表对新生的革命委员会最
    热爱，捍卫得最勇敢
    工人阶级在旧社会受压迫最重，吃苦最多。他们对走资派最愤恨，革命精神最强；他们对新生的革委会最热爱，捍卫得最勇敢。因此，在建设、巩固和发展新的无产阶级革命政权的战斗中，工人代表充分发挥了工人阶级的领导作用，充分表现了工人阶级的大无畏的革命精神。
    今年初，清理阶级队伍的工作在厂里轰轰烈烈开展起来以后，一个钻进革命群众组织的反革命两面派，就在厂里到处散布流言蜚语，制造分裂，另拉山头，企图破坏和搞垮新生的革委会，阻碍毛主席无产阶级革命路线的贯彻执行。这个问题一露头，厂革委会中的工人代表就反复学习毛主席关于“人民得到的权利，绝不允许轻易丧失，必须用战斗来保卫”的伟大教导，立即用毛泽东思想宣传群众，组织群众，武装群众，并且带领全厂工人揭露、批判反革命两面派的阴谋诡计。工人代表、革委会副主任曾广汇为了揭露敌人，保卫新生的革委会，几天几夜不回家，和工人一起研究敌情，一起写批判文章。在工人代表的带领下，从青年工人到老年工人，从职工家属到工厂子弟学校的革命师生，人人投入了捍卫新生的革委会的战斗，很快把混进革命群众组织的反革命两面派揪了出来，使新生的革委会在对敌斗争的风浪中得到了巩固和发展。
    工人代表对毛主席伟大战略部署
    跟得最紧，革命精神最彻底
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“只有工人阶级最有远见，大公无私，最富于革命的彻底性。”赣南造纸厂革委会成立后的许多事实说明，工人代表对毛主席的伟大战略部署跟得最紧，他们敢想、敢说、敢闯、敢干，敢于摧毁旧势力、旧制度，大胆建立新秩序、新风尚，具有彻底的革命精神。
    厂革命委员会一成立，工人代表就按照毛主席的教导，和革委会其他成员一起，实行“精兵简政”，将旧机构的三个室、七个科，共八十九名干部，精简为三个办公室，共三十九人，受到群众和上级领导机关的赞扬。在一片赞扬声中，有的委员便满足起来。后来，革委会全体委员在驻厂解放军支左人员带领下，到三十多年前毛主席亲自作过调查的兴国县长冈乡参观学习，了解了当年苏区干部的战斗化作风，并且联系革委会的工作实际找了差距，大家决心进一步跳出旧机构的圈子。正在这时，《人民日报》发表了河南省灵宝县精兵简政的经验和重要编者按，革委会中的工人代表闻风而动，同革委会其他成员一起认真学习，深刻领会，坚决照办。工人代表在毛泽东思想学习班上，带头揭发批判中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面推行的反革命修正主义路线，大找厂革委会同灵宝县革委会的差距，大摆精兵简政的好处和伟大意义，同群众一道研究方案，进一步精简了革委会的工作机构，把三个办公室改为三个组，工作人员由三十九人减少到二十人。
    毛主席教导说：“革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”
    工人代表认识到，要使革委会做到革命化，不仅人员要精简，而且要彻底改变高高在上的旧的工作作风，深入实际，深入群众，刻苦改造自己的思想，搞好思想革命化，全心全意为人民服务。革委会根据工人代表的建议，把办公室从大楼搬到了车间，使革委会的成员和工作人员都能经常保持同群众的密切联系。现在，革委会成员每天都带着红彤彤的革命宝书，到车间和工人们一起学习，一起斗私批修，一起劳动，一起研究工作，使全厂革命和生产都出现了崭新面貌。
