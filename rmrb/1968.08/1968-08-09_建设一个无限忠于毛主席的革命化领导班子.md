Over the past two years, the hundreds of millions of revolutionary people across the nation have closely united around the Great Proletarian Headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and with the force of a thunderbolt, launched a fierce attack on the bourgeois headquarters hidden within our party for a long time, led by China's Khrushchev, achieving decisive victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In March of this year, the revolutionary masses of Nanjing responded resolutely to Chairman Mao's great call to arms, seizing back all the power over party, government, finance, and culture from a handful of capitalist roaders within the old municipal committee, and establishing the Nanjing Municipal Revolutionary Committee. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought and a great victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Reflecting on the intense class struggles of the past two years, we have come to a deeper understanding that the fundamental issue of revolution is the issue of power. The Great Proletarian Headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin is the sole leadership center that upholds the socialist direction, upholds the dictatorship of the proletariat, and prevents the emergence of revisionism in our country. Vice Chairman Lin teaches us: leadership teams are very important, leadership teams are power. The bourgeois headquarters hidden within our party was composed of a handful of class enemies who had usurped part of our leadership. After seizing leadership, they imposed bourgeois dictatorship on the broad revolutionary masses. Fortresses are most easily breached from within, and power is most easily usurped by bad elements who infiltrate the leadership. After the establishment of our revolutionary committee, countless facts have proven that a handful of class enemies are not willing to accept their defeat. After the establishment of the revolutionary committee, they desperately launched attacks on our newly born revolutionary power. To restore capitalism, they exploited the serious bourgeois individualism and factionalism in the minds of some people, spreading the reactionary "multi-center theory," interfering with and disrupting Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, thereby achieving their evil goal of overthrowing the newly born revolutionary committee. To build the revolutionary committee into a leadership team that is unconditionally loyal to the Great Proletarian Headquarters led by Chairman Mao, and to thoroughly eliminate the poisonous influence of the bourgeois "multi-center theory," our revolutionary committee, while striving to learn and implement Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions, has firmly grasped the fundamental issue of the revolutionization of the leadership team. We believe that the leadership team must be a fighting collective composed of people who are unconditionally loyal to Chairman Mao, unconditionally loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and unconditionally loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, in order to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, repel the fierce attacks of the class enemies, and forever preserve the new revolutionary power from changing color.

The two years of struggle in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have made us deeply understand that while thoroughly smashing the bourgeois headquarters led by China's Khrushchev, building a leadership team at all levels that is unconditionally loyal to the Great Proletarian Headquarters led by Chairman Mao is a matter of paramount importance concerning the fate of our country and the future of the world revolution. Therefore, we must closely follow the strategic deployment of the great helmsman Chairman Mao, carry out a thorough revolutionary criticism, eliminate the poisonous influence and impact of the bourgeois headquarters in all aspects, and strive to build a leadership team that is unconditionally loyal to Chairman Mao's headquarters!

　　建设一个无限忠于毛主席的革命化领导班子
　　南京市革命委员会常委  李玉
    两年来，全国亿万革命人民，紧紧团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的周围，以雷霆万钧之势，向长期隐藏在我们党内的以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部发动猛烈的进攻，夺取了无产阶级文化大革命的决定性的胜利。今年三月，我们南京市无产阶级革命派坚决响应了毛主席的伟大战斗号召，向旧市委内一小撮走资派夺回了一切党、政、财、文大权，成立了南京市革命委员会。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利。
    回顾两年来惊心动魄的阶级斗争，使我们更加深刻地认识到，革命的根本问题是政权问题。以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，是坚持社会主义方向，坚持无产阶级专政，防止我国产生修正主义的唯一的领导中心。林副主席教导我们：领导班子很重要，领导班子就是政权。以前隐藏在我们党内的资产阶级司令部，就是由篡夺了我们一部分领导权的一小撮阶级敌人组成的。他们篡夺了领导权后，就对广大革命人民群众实行资产阶级专政。堡垒最容易从内部攻破，政权最容易被钻进领导班子里的坏人篡夺。我们革命委员会成立以后，无数事实证明了，一小撮阶级敌人决不甘心于他们的失败，在革命委员会成立以后，他们又拚死拚活地向我们新生的革命政权发动进攻。为了复辟资本主义，他们利用某些人头脑中存在的严重的资产阶级个人主义和山头主义，大肆散布反动的“多中心论”，干扰和破坏毛主席的伟大战略部署，从而达到他们颠覆新生的革命委员会的罪恶目的。为了把革委会建设成一个无限忠于以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的革命化的领导班子，为了彻底肃清资产阶级反动的“多中心论”的流毒，我们革命委员会在努力学习和贯彻毛主席一系列最新指示的同时，狠抓了领导班子革命化这个根本问题。我们认为：领导班子必须是由无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的人组成的战斗集体，才能紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，击退阶级敌人的猖狂进攻，永保新生的革命政权不变颜色。
    两年来无产阶级文化大革命的斗争实践，使我们深深懂得了，在彻底摧毁以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部的同时，建设一个无限忠于以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的各级领导班子，这是关系到我们国家命运和世界革命前途的头等重要的大事。因此，我们一定要紧跟伟大统帅毛主席的战略部署，搞好革命的大批判，肃清资产阶级司令部在各方面的流毒和影响，为建设一个无限忠于毛主席司令部的领导班子而努力奋斗！
