Premier Zhou Enlai Delivers Important Speech at the Romanian Embassy's National Day Reception
The Chinese Government and People Strongly Condemn the Soviet Revisionist Group's Occupation of Czechoslovakia
Firmly Support the Brave Struggle of the Czechoslovakian People Against the Soviet Military Occupation

The Czechoslovakian people, with their glorious revolutionary tradition, will never yield to the Soviet revisionists' military occupation and will certainly continue their revolutionary struggle against the Soviet revisionists and the domestic revisionist clique.

The Soviet revisionist clique has long since degenerated into social imperialism and social fascism. The misdeeds of the Soviet revisionists and their followers can only accelerate their own complete collapse and the complete disintegration of the entire modern revisionist clique.

New China News Agency, August 23rd: Premier Zhou Enlai delivered the following speech at the reception held by Romanian Ambassador Dumitru:

Honorable Ambassador Dumitru, Comrades, Friends:

Today marks the 24th anniversary of the Romanian people's liberation from fascist shackles. On behalf of the Chinese people and the Chinese government, I extend warm congratulations to the Romanian people and the Romanian government!

Twenty-four years ago, the Romanian Communist Party led the people in an armed uprising, overthrowing the reactionary government of Antonescu, and opening a new chapter in Romanian history. Over the past 24 years, the Romanian people and their leaders have utilized their own resources and relied on their own efforts to achieve significant successes in the construction of their country. We wish the Romanian people new victories in their struggle to defend and build their own country, and to carry forward their spirit of diligence and bravery.

Comrades, Friends! Recently, the Soviet revisionist leadership and their followers brazenly dispatched a large number of armed forces to launch a sudden attack on Czechoslovakia. In the face of the Czechoslovakian revisionist leadership's open call for the people not to resist, they quickly occupied Czechoslovakia, committing heinous crimes against the Czechoslovakian people.

This is the most blatant and typical example of the fascist hegemony politics practiced by the Soviet revisionist traitor and strike-breaker clique against its so-called allies. This marks the complete bankruptcy of Soviet modern revisionism.

The Chinese government and people strongly condemn the Soviet revisionist leadership and their followers' aggressive act of occupying Czechoslovakia with military force, and firmly support the brave struggle of the Czechoslovakian people against the Soviet military occupation.

For a long time, the modern revisionist clique centered around the Soviet revisionist leadership has been riddled with contradictions and crises. The Soviet revisionist leadership's brazen occupation of Czechoslovakia is aimed at preventing the Czechoslovakian revisionist leadership from directly aligning with the Western countries led by U.S. imperialism, and at preventing the development of an uncontrollable chain reaction. This is the inevitable result of the Soviet revisionist leadership's pursuit of great-power chauvinism and national egoism, and the inevitable outcome of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique's long-term implementation of Khrushchev revisionism.

The Soviet revisionist leadership has discarded all the pretexts of their so-called "Marxism-Leninism" and "internationalism," openly resorting to direct military aggression and intervention, using guns to create puppets. This is no different from Hitler's aggression against Czechoslovakia in the past and the U.S. imperialists' aggression against Vietnam today. The Soviet revisionist traitor clique has long since degenerated into social imperialism and social fascism.

The Soviet revisionist leadership has always pursued a counter-revolutionary policy of U.S.-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world. Without going too far back, since the Glassboro talks, the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionists have engaged in a series of dirty deals on major issues such as Vietnam, the Middle East, and the prevention of nuclear proliferation. This time's Czechoslovakian incident is no exception. This incident is the result of the sharpening contradictions between the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionists in their struggle for dominance and division of spheres of influence in Eastern Europe, and the result of their collusion to attempt to re-divide the world. The Soviet revisionists' aggression was carried out with the tacit approval of the U.S. imperialists. Since the U.S. imperialists tacitly approve of the Soviet revisionists' occupation of Czechoslovakia, how can the Soviet revisionists possibly oppose the U.S. imperialists' occupation of South Vietnam? In fact, the Soviet revisionists have long since become the number one accomplice of the U.S. imperialists' aggression against Vietnam and the world. The fact that a big country can so arbitrarily carve up a small country is a very profound lesson for those who harbor illusions about the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionists.

The Soviet revisionists' armed aggression has brought disaster to the Czechoslovakian people, but it has also educated the Czechoslovakian people, enabling them to gradually recognize that revisionism is the root cause of this disaster. This is also a good lesson for the Soviet people, the peoples of Eastern European countries, and the people of the whole world. Our great leader Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "Some people may not be able to see clearly for a period of time, may be deceived, and may make some mistakes, but as long as they want revolution, once they know the truth and recognize the true face of revisionism, they will ultimately break with revisionism and stand on the side of Marxism-Leninism in the course of revolutionary practice." We believe that the Czechoslovakian people, with their glorious revolutionary tradition, will never yield to the Soviet revisionists' military occupation, and will certainly continue their revolutionary struggle against the Soviet revisionist leadership and the domestic revisionist leadership. The misdeeds of the Soviet revisionist leadership and their followers can only accelerate their own complete collapse and the complete disintegration of the entire modern revisionist clique.

Comrades! Friends! Romania is currently facing the danger of external interference and aggression. The Romanian government is mobilizing the people to struggle to defend their independence and sovereignty. The Chinese people, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, support you. We firmly believe that as long as you truly rely on the masses of the people and persist in a protracted struggle, any external interference and aggression can be defeated and will certainly be defeated.

Down with U.S. imperialism!

Down with Soviet revisionism!

The people will win!

Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Romanian peoples!

    新华社二十三日讯　国务院总理周恩来今晚在罗马尼亚驻中国大使杜马举行的国庆招待会上的讲话，全文如下：尊敬的杜马大使，同志们，朋友们：
    今天是罗马尼亚人民从法西斯枷锁下获得解放的二十四周年。我代表中国人民和中国政府，向罗马尼亚人民和罗马尼亚政府表示热烈的祝贺！
    二十四年前，罗马尼亚共产党领导人民，举行武装起义，推翻了安东尼斯库反动政权，在罗马尼亚历史上开辟了新的一页。二十四年来，罗马尼亚人民及其领导者利用本国资源，自力更生，在建设祖国的事业中取得了重大的成就。我们祝罗马尼亚人民在捍卫和建设自己祖国的斗争中发扬勤劳勇敢的精神，取得新的胜利。
    同志们，朋友们！最近，苏联修正主义领导集团及其追随者悍然出动大量武装部队，对捷克斯洛伐克进行突然袭击，在捷修领导集团公开号召人民不抵抗的情况下，迅速地占领了捷克斯洛伐克，对捷克斯洛伐克人民犯下了滔天罪行。
    这是苏修叛徒、工贼集团对它的所谓盟国推行法西斯强权政治的最露骨、最典型的表现。这标志着苏联现代修正主义的总破产。
    中国政府和中国人民强烈谴责苏修领导集团及其追随者武装占领捷克斯洛伐克的侵略罪行，坚决支持捷克斯洛伐克人民反抗苏军占领的英勇斗争。
    长期以来，以苏修领导集团为中心的现代修正主义内部矛盾重重，危机四伏。苏修领导集团这次悍然侵占捷克斯洛伐克，是为了不让捷修领导集团直接投靠以美帝国主义为首的西方国家，是为了防止这一局势的发展产生不可收拾的连锁反应。这是苏修领导集团推行大国沙文主义和民族利己主义的必然结果，是苏修叛徒集团长期执行赫鲁晓夫修正主义的必然结果。
    苏修领导集团抛弃了它的所谓“马列主义”、“国际主义”的一切遮羞布，公然诉之于直接的武装侵略和干涉，用枪炮制造傀儡。这同当年希特勒的侵略捷克斯洛伐克和今天美帝的侵略越南一模一样。苏修叛徒集团早已堕落成为社会帝国主义和社会法西斯主义。
    苏修领导集团一贯奉行美苏合作主宰世界的反革命政策。远的不说，自从葛拉斯堡罗会谈以来，美帝、苏修在越南、中东和防止核扩散等重大问题上就进行了一系列的肮脏交易。这一次的捷克斯洛伐克事件也不例外。这一事件是美帝和苏修在东欧争夺和划分势力范围的矛盾尖锐化的结果，也是美苏勾结妄图重新瓜分世界引起的结果。苏修的侵略是在美帝的默契下进行的。既然美帝默契苏修侵占捷克斯洛伐克，那么苏修还怎么可能去反对美帝霸占越南南方呢？实际上苏修早已成为美帝侵略越南、侵略世界的头号帮凶。一个大国可以如此任意宰割一个小国，这对于那些对美帝、苏修抱有幻想的人们是一个极其深刻的教训。
    苏修的武装侵略给捷克斯洛伐克人民带来了灾难，也教育了捷克斯洛伐克人民，使他们逐步认识到修正主义是这场灾难的根源。这对于苏联人民、东欧各国人民和全世界人民也是一次很好的教育。我们的伟大领袖毛主席早就指出：“有些人在一个时期之内，可能认识不清楚，也可能被蒙蔽，也可能犯些错误，但是，只要他们要革命，在他们知道事实的真相，认识了修正主义的真面目以后，在革命实践的过程中，最后总是会同修正主义决裂，站到马克思列宁主义方面来的。”我们相信，具有光荣革命传统的捷克斯洛伐克人民决不会屈服于苏修的军事占领，一定会继续起来把反对苏修领导集团和本国修正主义领导集团的革命斗争进行下去，而苏修领导集团及其追随者的倒行逆施只能加速它们自己的彻底垮台，加速整个现代修正主义集团的彻底崩溃。
    同志们！朋友们！罗马尼亚目前正面临着遭受外来的干涉和侵略的危险。罗马尼亚政府正在动员人民为捍卫自己的独立和主权而斗争。在无产阶级文化大革命中锻炼得更加坚强的中国人民支持你们。我们坚信，只要真正依靠人民群众，坚持持久斗争，任何外来的干涉和侵略是可以击败的，也是一定能够击败的。
    美帝必败！
    苏修必败！
    人民必胜！
    中罗两国人民友谊万岁！
