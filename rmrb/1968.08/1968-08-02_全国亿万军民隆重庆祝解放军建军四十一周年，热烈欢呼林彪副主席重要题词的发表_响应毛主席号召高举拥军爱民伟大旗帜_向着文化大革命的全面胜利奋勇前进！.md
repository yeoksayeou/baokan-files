	New China News Agency, August 1st: Amidst the triumphant songs of seizing complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the entire nation, with its hundreds of millions of military and civilian personnel, solemnly celebrates the 41st anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army, which was personally founded and led by the great commander Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin Biao. They enthusiastically hail the publication of Vice Chairman Lin Biao's important inscription and have seriously studied the important editorials in the People's Daily, Red Flag magazine, and the Liberation Army Daily, "The Strong Pillar of the Proletarian Dictatorship." Hundreds of millions of military and civilian personnel resolutely declare that they will, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, raise high the great banner of "supporting the military and loving the people," consolidate and develop the great victories already achieved in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, consolidate and develop the newly established revolutionary committees, and stride forward towards the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

	After two years of tempering in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the great People's Liberation Army has become even stronger. The relationship between the military and the people, and between the military and the government, has never been as close as it is now. Our national defense has never been as solid as it is now. During the solemn celebration of the "August 1st" Army Day, in various cities and countryside across the country, and in the garrisons and barracks of the People's Liberation Army, everywhere is filled with joy and enthusiasm, and everywhere are moving scenes of the military loving the people and the people supporting the military. The various headquarters, military branches, and military regions of the People's Liberation Army, as well as the capitals of Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and various provinces and autonomous regions, held grand celebration rallies. The revolutionary committees of various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, along with local military leaders, delivered speeches at the celebration rallies in their respective locations. The officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and the broad revolutionary masses at the rallies raised their arms and shouted: "Long live the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!" "Long live the great People's Liberation Army!" "Long live the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China!" "Long live the great commander Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" They shouted: "We must definitely liberate Taiwan!" Many factories, mines, enterprises, institutions, schools, units, and rural people's communes also held report meetings, discussion meetings, and military-civilian joint celebrations. The broad revolutionary masses held high portraits of Chairman Mao, beat drums, and went to the military garrisons to perform artistic performances praising the people's sons and daughters in arms, warmly visiting the People's Liberation Army. Various units sent many Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to factories, institutions, schools, and rural people's communes to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions and widely solicit the opinions of the people. Various places checked and revised the "Agreement on Supporting the Military and Loving the People" during the holiday, launching a new wave of activities to support the military and love the people.

	Praising the Great Army's Great Achievements and Cherishing the People's Liberation Army as One Would Cherish Their Own Eyes

	"Without an army of the people, there would be nothing of the people." During the enthusiastic celebration of the 41st anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army, members of revolutionary committees at all levels and hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses across the country praise the great achievements of the People's Liberation Army and resolve to cherish the PLA as they would their own eyes. Many members of revolutionary committees enthusiastically praised, saying that the great People's Liberation Army has been unyieldingly defending and executing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the People's Liberation Army resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "support the leftist broad masses," actively participated in the "three supports and two militaries" work, made outstanding contributions, and established new great achievements. After the establishment of revolutionary committees at various levels, the broad officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, with their model actions, trusted, respected, supported, helped, and protected the revolutionary committees at various levels, bringing the glorious revolutionary traditions and political work experience of the People's Liberation Army into the revolutionary committees, promoting the ideological revolutionization and organizational revolutionization of the revolutionary committees, and fully playing the role of a strong pillar of the proletarian dictatorship. Members of revolutionary committees at various places expressed that they would definitely follow Chairman Mao's great teachings of "supporting the military and loving the people," lead the broad revolutionary masses to carry out the movement to support the military extensively, deeply, and persistently, firmly believe in, rely on, support, and love the People's Liberation Army, and never allow anyone to damage this great wall of the People's Liberation Army!

	The revolutionary workers of Nanjing Puzhen Vehicle Factory discussed and praised the great achievements of the PLA at a meeting celebrating the "August 1st" Army Day, feeling more and more that the PLA is close to them, and the more they talked, the deeper their feelings for the PLA became. They expressed that they would definitely firmly believe in and rely on the People's Liberation Army, better love and support the PLA, better learn from and support the PLA, further consolidate and develop the newly established revolutionary committees, strengthen the proletarian dictatorship, and seize the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The revolutionary workers of Taiyuan Phenol-Formaldehyde Plastic Factory said, the People's Liberation Army is an army armed with the great thought of Mao Zedong, and they are our most beloved people. In the past war years, they used their blood and lives to fight for the people and create immortal achievements; in the deepening of socialist revolution today, they, with their unyielding loyalty to Chairman Mao, firmly support the leftist broad masses, enthusiastically propagate Mao Zedong Thought, defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, defend the proletarian dictatorship, and have established new achievements for the people. We must cherish the People's Liberation Army as we would cherish our own eyes. The revolutionary workers of the No. 9 blast furnace and No. 8 open-hearth furnace of Anshan Steel said excitedly, in the old society, if we workers wanted to eat Anshan's food, we had to risk our lives. It is the People's Liberation Army, personally founded and led by Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin, that liberated us from the depths of suffering. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, in our struggle against the power seizure by the agent of the Chinese Khrushchev in Anshan, it was the People's Liberation Army that stood up to support and protect the proletarian revolutionary masses. Without the PLA, there would be nothing for us workers, and there would be no great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must forever unite, fight, and win with the People's Liberation Army.

	Launching a New High Tide of Learning from the PLA and Mastering the Good Traditions and Styles of the PLA

	Members of revolutionary committees at various places and the broad revolutionary masses, during the solemn celebration of the 41st anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army, enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's great call, determined to better "learn politics, military affairs, the four firsts, the three-eighths style, the three major disciplines and eight points for attention from the PLA, and strengthen organizational discipline." Many leaders of revolutionary committees at various places pointed out at the local celebration meetings that learning from the PLA means to be as loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, as loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and as loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line as the PLA; to put the active study and application of Mao Zedong Thought in the first place in all work, and regard the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions as one's sacred duty; to have a firm stand, clear distinctions between love and hate, be ruthless to the enemy and lenient to oneself, resolutely suppress the enemy, and resolutely protect the people; to strictly implement the three major disciplines and eight points for attention, have high organizational discipline, and be in the forefront and set examples on all fronts. Li Shunda, a nationally famous agricultural labor model, said, the People's Liberation Army is the people's army personally founded and led by Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin, a strong pillar of the proletarian dictatorship, and a strong backing for us poor and lower-middle peasants. We poor and lower-middle peasants and the PLA are blood-related, heart-to-heart, and one family. We poor and lower-middle peasants must learn from the PLA to actively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, highlight proletarian politics, insist on the four firsts, and carry forward the fine traditions of the three-eighths style, turning the countryside into a red Mao Zedong Thought school. Members of the revolutionary committee of Wuhan No. 3 Cotton Mill reviewed the course of fighting side by side with the PLA propaganda team stationed in the factory and deeply felt that the People's Liberation Army is our best example to learn from. They decided to carry out the mass movement of learning from the PLA more extensively and deeply with workshops and teams as units. The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Stamp Factory, who have been working day and night to print special stamps with Vice Chairman Lin's inscription, have been checking the implementation of the "Agreement on Supporting the Military" and holding various activities to support the military. They expressed that they would definitely, like the PLA, resolutely implement, bravely defend, and actively propagate the great thought of Mao Zedong and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, firmly follow the path of highlighting proletarian politics. Members of the revolutionary committee of Qinghai Red Guard No. 1 Machine Tool Factory expressed that they would definitely master the good traditions, styles, and experiences of the PLA, and build the revolutionary committee into a revolutionary, authoritative, and vigorous battle command department of the proletariat. Leaders of the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters today led teams to visit the Longjiang ship of the East China Fleet, which Chairman Mao personally inspected, and other military camps to visit the PLA and learn from them. They expressed that the Shanghai working class must learn from the PLA's noble qualities of being unyieldingly loyal to Chairman Mao, unyieldingly loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and unyieldingly loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, forever unite, fight, and win with the officers and soldiers stationed in Shanghai, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

	Resolutely Following the Path of Supporting the Government and Loving the People and Consolidating and Developing the Newly Established Revolutionary Committees

	The broad officers and soldiers of the PLA stationed in various places, during the enthusiastic celebration of the 41st anniversary of the founding of our army, seriously studied and enthusiastically discussed Vice Chairman Lin's important inscription and the editorials in the People's Daily, Red Flag magazine, and the Liberation Army Daily. They unanimously declared that they would resolutely respond to the great battle call of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, resolutely follow the path of supporting the government and loving the people, trust, respect, support, help, and protect the revolutionary committees, and guide the broad revolutionary masses to cherish and strengthen their own proletarian power organs, better play the role of a strong pillar of the proletarian dictatorship. The broad officers and soldiers of the PLA stationed in various places expressed at the celebration rallies that they would definitely remember the great teachings of the great teacher Chairman Mao about "the Chinese Red Army is a group of armed people executing revolutionary political tasks," carry forward the glorious tradition of our army in propagating, organizing, and arming the masses and helping the masses build revolutionary political power, and contribute everything to consolidating and developing the newly established revolutionary committees and strengthening the proletarian dictatorship. The former units of "good cadres unyieldingly loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line" Meng He and "model of supporting the left and loving the people" Li Wenzhong, as well as many units fighting on the front lines of the "three supports and two militaries," learned from Vice Chairman Lin's inscription and editorials and decided to, like Meng He and Li Wenzhong, fight for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and die for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, regarding the consolidation and development of revolutionary committees as the current major battle task of defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The units fighting on the front lines of supporting the left in the steel city of Anshan regard the consolidation and development of revolutionary committees as the greatest support for the government and the greatest love for the people. The supporting-the-left personnel stationed in various factories, mines, enterprises, institutions, and schools all held various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes with the theme of consolidating and developing revolutionary committees, determined to further help the revolutionary committees actively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, grasp class struggle, and make the revolutionary committees truly become the battle command departments leading the broad revolutionary masses to seize new victories. Military representatives participating in the revolutionary committee of Xingguo County, Jiangxi Province, expressed that they would definitely learn from the revolutionary predecessors of Xingguo County who "created first-class work," bravely shoulder the heavy responsibility of helping to "organize a revolutionary leadership cadre that is connected with the masses" given by Chairman Mao, bring Chairman Mao's proletarian military thought and Vice Chairman Lin's principles and policies of actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, highlighting proletarian politics, insisting on the four firsts, carrying forward the three-eighths style, developing the three great democracies, and carrying out the four-good-company movement into the revolutionary committees, and use them in political power construction, thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev on the issue of political power, overcome the influence of old habits of thought left in people's minds, and help the revolutionary committees achieve ideological revolutionization and organizational revolutionization. Many military representatives of revolutionary committees at various levels expressed that they would definitely remember Chairman Mao's great teachings of "the masses are the real heroes," be modest and prudent, guard against arrogance and impetuousness, forever maintain close ties with the people, be the students of the people, serve the people wholeheartedly, and be the faithful servants of the people for life. Since this year, the air force unit that has shot down three invading U.S. imperialist spy planes, the "Steel Eight Company" on the front line of the South China Sea, the "Second Division of Jinan" that patrols the coast of our motherland day and night, and the officers and soldiers of the units stationed on the front lines of the national border and coastal defense have repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's great teachings of "spare no effort to annihilate the invading enemy," determined to be highly vigilant, strengthen preparedness, and be ready at any time to give the invading enemy a devastating blow, defend the proletarian dictatorship, and defend the great socialist motherland.

	Further Strengthening the Revolutionary Construction of the Army and Better Playing the Role of a Pillar of the Proletarian Dictatorship

	The broad officers and soldiers, while studying Vice Chairman Lin's inscription and editorials, deeply felt that, under the new historical conditions, the People's Liberation Army must further strengthen the revolutionary construction of the army to complete the great historical mission given by Chairman Mao. The party committee members of a certain regiment, who established outstanding achievements by burning the Yangmingbao Japanese airfield during the War of Resistance Against Japan, today went to the companies in batches to celebrate the holiday with the soldiers. They said that they would definitely better understand Chairman Mao's great theory, line, policy, and principles of continuing the revolution under the conditions of the proletarian dictatorship, further raise their awareness of the struggle between the two lines, and complete the new historical tasks, becoming a strong pillar of the proletarian dictatorship. The officers and soldiers of the "Iron Red Second Company" of a certain unit, where Vice Chairman Lin served as the first company commander, read Vice Chairman Lin's inscription and editorials over and over again, excitedly recalling the battle course of the company, and expressed that they would resolutely execute Vice Chairman Lin's instructions, better strive to actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, grasp the education of the struggle between the two lines, further make themselves an army armed with Mao Zedong Thought, an army that serves the people wholeheartedly, and an invincible army. The officers and soldiers of a certain unit of the Nanjing Army, which was developed and grown up by 36 wounded and sick soldiers of the New Fourth Army 30 years ago according to Chairman Mao's military thought and military line at the banks of Yangcheng Lake, decided to raise high the red flag of Chairman Mao's military thought and military line, further strengthen the revolutionary construction of the army. Many famous four-good companies and four-good units expressed their indignation at the counter-revolutionary revisionists Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing's implementation of the bourgeois military line during the study and resolutely declared that they would definitely, in all aspects of company construction, better implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, seriously implement Vice Chairman Lin's principles and policies of political construction of the army, firmly follow the path of highlighting proletarian politics, push the great mass movement of actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, push the creation of four-good companies and the ongoing "three loyalties" activities to a new high tide, and forever be the steadfast soldiers who execute and defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to the death.
