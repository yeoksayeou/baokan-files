Chairman Mao teaches us: “The Communist Party of China is the core leadership of the entire Chinese people. Without such a core, the cause of socialism cannot be victorious.” The editorial in the People’s Daily on August 5 also emphasizes: “The proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin is the sole leadership center for the entire Party, the entire army, the entire nation, and the broad revolutionary masses. The entire Party, the entire army, and the entire nation can only have such a center and cannot have a second center.” Reviewing the two-year battle history of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we deeply feel that: closely uniting around the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, resolutely executing every battle order of the proletarian headquarters, and fully implementing every latest directive of Chairman Mao is victory; even the slightest deviation from Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line and separation from the wise leadership of Chairman Mao’s proletarian headquarters will lead to setbacks and failures in the revolution.

Our practice in the Cultural Revolution at Xizhimen Station illustrates this point. In the early stages of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, due to the influence of the bourgeois reactionary line and the instigation of a handful of class enemies, our station’s proletariat and revolutionary masses split into two major factions, forming more than ten mass organizations. Some people within these organizations, for the sake of their own small group’s interests, disregarded the overall interests and the bigger picture, constantly attacking each other and engaging in endless “internal warfare.” They all wanted to “put myself at the center” to devour the other side and expand their own strength, to the extent that they could no longer hear the voice from the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and Chairman Mao’s latest directives could not be carried out, seriously disrupting Chairman Mao’s great strategic deployment and causing great losses to the revolution and production.

Last September, after Chairman Mao’s latest directive, “Within the proletariat, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the proletariat to split into two irreconcilable factions,” was issued, we immediately took action and carried it out resolutely. We promptly organized everyone to conduct a rectification campaign, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao’s great teachings, extensively discussed the essence of the two-line struggle, extensively spoke about the harm of the two factions’ opposition, and fiercely criticized the evil plot of China’s Khrushchev to preserve himself by inciting the masses to fight against the masses. Everyone’s class consciousness and two-line struggle consciousness greatly improved, and they quickly achieved revolutionary great unity and the three-in-one combination on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, ensuring the full implementation of Chairman Mao’s latest directives. Countless facts show that the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin is the only correct leadership center for the working people. The so-called “multi-center theory” is essentially “putting myself at the center,” which is a reactionary ideology of bourgeois factionalism and individualism. It disperses the unity of the revolutionary ranks on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought and hinders the implementation of the proletarian revolutionary line. Therefore, we must fiercely criticize this reactionary ideology.

We must thoroughly criticize the reactionary “multi-center theory,” strengthen the proletarian overall concept, strengthen proletarian organizational discipline, be even more infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao’s proletarian headquarters, forever unite under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao’s great strategic deployment, and implement without exception every battle order of the proletarian headquarters, fully implement Chairman Mao’s latest directives, thoroughly transform our worldview, strengthen our struggle against the enemy, deeply and persistently carry out the revolutionary great criticism, thoroughly criticize and expose the reactionary “multi-center theory,” and thoroughly eliminate its poison, steadfastly carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!

    毛主席教导我们说：“中国共产党是全中国人民的领导核心。没有这样一个核心，社会主义事业就不能胜利。”《人民日报》八月五日社论也着重指出：“以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，是全党、全军、全国和广大革命群众唯一的领导中心。全党、全军、全国只能有这样一个中心，不能有第二个中心。”回顾两年来无产阶级文化大革命的战斗历程，使我们深深体会到：紧紧地团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的周围，坚决执行无产阶级司令部的每一个战斗号令，全面落实毛主席的每一个最新指示，就是胜利；稍微背离了毛主席的革命路线，脱离了毛主席无产阶级司令部的英明领导，就会使革命遭到挫折和失败。
    我们西直门车站文化大革命的实践就说明了这个问题。在无产阶级文化大革命初期，由于受资产阶级反动路线的影响和一小撮阶级敌人的挑拨，使我们车站的工人阶级和革命群众分成了两大派，组成十几个群众组织。这些组织中的一些人，各自为了小团体的利益，把整体利益和大局置于脑后，整天互相攻击，“内战”不休。他们都要“以我为中心”来吃掉对方，扩大自己的力量，以致发展到来自以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的声音都听不进去，毛主席的最新指示也不能贯彻下去，严重地干扰了毛主席的伟大战略部署，给革命和生产带来了极大的损失。
    去年九月，毛主席“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织”的最新指示发出以后，我们立即行动，坚决照办。我们及时组织大家进行了整风，反复学习了毛主席的伟大教导，大议了两条路线斗争的实质，大讲了两派对立的危害，狠揭猛批中国赫鲁晓夫为了保存自己，挑动群众斗群众的罪恶阴谋。大家的阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟大大提高，很快就在毛泽东思想的基础上实现了革命的大联合和革命的三结合，保证了毛主席最新指示的全面落实。无数事实说明：以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部是我们劳动人民唯一正确的领导中心。所谓“多中心论”，实质上是“以我为中心”，它是资产阶级山头主义、个人主义的反动思想，它涣散革命队伍在毛泽东思想基础上的团结，妨碍无产阶级革命路线的贯彻执行。因此，必须狠批这种反动思想。
    我们一定要彻底批判反动的“多中心论”，加强无产阶级整体观念，加强无产阶级的组织纪律性，更加无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级司令部，永远团结在毛泽东思想的伟大红旗下，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，不折不扣地贯彻执行无产阶级司令部的每一个战斗号令，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，彻底改造世界观，加强对敌斗争，深入持久地开展革命的大批判，把反动的“多中心论”批深批透，批倒批臭，彻底肃清它的流毒，坚定不移地将这场无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
