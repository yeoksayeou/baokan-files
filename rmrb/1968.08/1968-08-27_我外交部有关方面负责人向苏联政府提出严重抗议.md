Chinese foreign ministry officials protest to the Soviet government

The Soviet government must immediately stop these provocative actions and ensure that such incidents do not recur, otherwise the Soviet government will bear all the consequences.

New China News Agency, August 26th: Today, a responsible official from the Soviet and Eastern European Affairs Department of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned the acting charge d'affaires of the Soviet Embassy in China, Razdukhov, to protest the invasion of the Chinese embassy in Czechoslovakia by Soviet occupying forces and the firing of shots into the air above the embassy, which threatened the safety and normal operations of the embassy.

The responsible official from the Soviet and Eastern European Affairs Department of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs pointed out, "Recently, the Soviet occupying forces in Czechoslovakia have been conducting armed patrols and setting up sentry posts around the Chinese embassy in Czechoslovakia, monitoring the activities of the embassy. On August 24th at 11:00 AM (Prague time), several Soviet occupying forces illegally entered the embassy of the People's Republic of China in Czechoslovakia. On the evening of August 25th at 10:00 PM, the Soviet occupying forces fired dozens of shots into the air above the embassy. All of these actions directly threaten the safety and normal operations of the embassy. This is a very serious incident and a provocation against the Chinese people. The Chinese government and people express great indignation over this."

The responsible official from the Soviet and Eastern European Affairs Department of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs finally solemnly pointed out, "I am instructed to protest in the strongest terms to the Soviet government. The Soviet government must immediately stop these provocative actions and ensure that such incidents do not recur, otherwise the Soviet government will bear all the consequences."
