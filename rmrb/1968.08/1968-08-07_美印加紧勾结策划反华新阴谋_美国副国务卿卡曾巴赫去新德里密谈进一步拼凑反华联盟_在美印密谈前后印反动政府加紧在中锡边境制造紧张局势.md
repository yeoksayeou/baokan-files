The U.S. and India Tighten Ties to Plot New Anti-China Conspiracy
U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Cyrus Vance Visits New Delhi for Secret Talks to Further Form Anti-China Alliance
Indian Reactionary Government Intensifies Tensions on the Sino-Indian Border Before and After U.S.-India Secret Talks

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on August 6, New Delhi: U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Cyrus Vance held secret talks in New Delhi with the Indian reactionary government from July 23 to 28, intensifying U.S.-Indian collusion and plotting new anti-China conspiracies.

To tighten their collusion and jointly oppose China, the U.S. and India had previously reached an agreement to hold regular bilateral talks between the two governments. This secret U.S.-Indian talk was conducted in accordance with this agreement. According to a report by the U.S. mouthpiece Associated Press on August 1, the U.S. authorities considered the U.S.-Indian talks "valuable because they opened another channel of communication with the Indian government."

Although both the U.S. and India kept the contents of this secret talk confidential, messages leaked by U.S. and Indian news agencies and newspapers before and after the talk revealed that Vance's visit to India was aimed at collaborating with the Indian reactionaries to plot new anti-China conspiracies. Before the U.S.-Indian talks, the Associated Press disclosed that the main agenda of this U.S.-Indian talk was to discuss the so-called "long-term security issues in Asia," "Communist China and its growing nuclear capabilities and the security issues this poses for India." The Indian newspaper *The Statesman* also revealed that a so-called "China expert" involved in formulating the U.S. long-term plans against China participated in the U.S. delegation to India.

During the U.S.-Indian secret talks, Vance reiterated the U.S. imperialism's consistent aggressive deployment in Asia, which is to instigate some reactionary regimes, with U.S. support, to form a counter-revolutionary encirclement aimed at opposing China. He assured the Indian government that "the Johnson administration has not softened or changed its policy towards Communist China." The Indian reactionary government, on the other hand, shouted that "Communist China is a constant threat." In addition to reiterating Indira Gandhi's anti-China stance, it proposed a plan to organize an anti-China alliance under the guise of "strengthening economic ties" among countries surrounding China. According to Western newspapers, this plan received "enthusiastic" support from U.S. imperialism.

According to reports from Western newspapers, U.S. imperialism has been trying to form an anti-China alliance with Japan and India as its pillars. The Indian reactionary government, in turn, aspires to be the leader of the anti-China alliance supported by the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists in the Asian region, using this to expand its influence in these regions. Therefore, it eagerly serves U.S. imperialism in forming this anti-China alliance. This U.S.-Indian secret talk plotted further conspiracies to form this counter-revolutionary alliance.

Before and after Vance's visit to India, the Indian reactionary government has been intensifying provocations on the Sino-Indian border, creating border tensions. Following the Indian reactionary government's dispatch of nine military aircraft to intrude into Chinese airspace for military provocations from late May to early June, it recently created multiple incidents of Indian military incursions. Indian troops have also been gathering in the frontline areas of the Sino-Indian border, frequently conducting provocative military exercises, and making provocative broadcasts to Chinese troops. To cover up its provocative activities, the Indian reactionary government has adopted the tactic of accusing others first, fabricating various rumors such as "China is concentrating troops in the border areas" and "Chinese troops have invaded Indian territory," and using the parliament and propaganda machinery to hype these issues.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until they are wiped out—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world in dealing with the people's cause. They will never deviate from this logic."

The U.S. and Indian reactionaries' tightening of collusion against China can only be described as striking a stone with an egg, leading to their own doom.

　　美印加紧勾结策划反华新阴谋
　　美国副国务卿卡曾巴赫去新德里密谈进一步拼凑反华联盟
　　在美印密谈前后印反动政府加紧在中锡边境制造紧张局势
    据新华社六日讯　新德里消息：美国副国务卿卡曾巴赫在七月二十三日至二十八日到新德里和印度反动政府举行秘密会谈，加紧美印全面勾结，策划新的反华阴谋。
    美印为了加紧勾结，共同反华，曾经达成两个政府定期举行双边会谈的协议。这次卡曾巴赫去印度举行的美印秘密会谈，就是根据这一协议进行的。据美帝喉舌美联社一日的一则报道透露，美国当局认为美印会谈“是有价值的，因为它开辟了同印度政府联系的又一条线路”。
    尽管美印双方对这次秘密会谈的内容秘而不宣，但从美国、印度的一些通讯社、报纸在会谈前后透露的消息表明，卡曾巴赫这次去印度的目的是伙同印度反动派全面策划反华新阴谋。在美印会谈前，美联社就透露，这次美印会谈主要是讨论所谓亚洲“长远性的安全问题”，“共产党中国和它日益发展的核力量以及这种情况对印度所造成的安全问题”。印度《政治家报》也透露，美国“参预制订美国对付中国的长远计划”的所谓“中国问题专家”，参加了美国去印代表团。
    在美印秘密会谈中，卡曾巴赫重申了美帝国主义在亚洲一贯的侵略部署，即指使一些国家的反动派，在美帝支持下拼凑旨在反对中国的反革命包围圈。他向印度政府保证，“约翰逊政府并没有缓和或改变它对共产党中国的政策”。印度反动政府则叫嚷“共产党中国是一种经常的威胁”。它除了重申英迪拉·甘地的反华主张外，并提出了一个在中国周围国家中，在“加强经济联系”的幌子下组织反华联盟计划。据西方报纸透露，这个计划得到了美帝国主义“热烈的”支持。
    据西方国家报纸透露，美帝国主义一直在设法拼凑以日本和印度为支柱的反华联盟，印度反动政府则一心想充当美帝、苏修支持的亚洲地区反华联盟的盟主，借此向这些地区实行扩张，因此，卖力地为美帝拼凑这个反华联盟效劳。美印这次秘密会谈策划了进一步拼凑这个反革命联盟的阴谋。
    在卡曾巴赫访印前后，印度反动政府一直在中锡边境加紧挑衅活动，制造边境紧张局势。印度反动政府继在五月底至六月初连续派遣军用飞机九架次侵入中国领土上空进行军事挑衅后，最近又多次制造印军越境挑衅事件。印军还在中锡边境前沿地区集结军队，频繁地进行挑衅性的军事演习，并向中国军队进行挑衅性的广播。为了掩盖自己的挑衅活动，印度反动政府采取恶人先告状的手法，大造所谓中国在边境地区“集结军队”、中国军队“入侵”印度领土等种种谣言，并利用议会、开动宣传机器大肆渲染。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席指出：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”
    美帝和印度反动派加紧勾结反华，只能是以卵击石，自取灭亡。
