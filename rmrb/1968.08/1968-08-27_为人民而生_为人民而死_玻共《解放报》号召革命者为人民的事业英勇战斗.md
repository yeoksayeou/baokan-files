	Born for the People, Die for the People
	The Bolivian Communist Party's "Liberation Daily" Calls for Revolutionaries to Fight Bravely for the People's Cause

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report, La Paz: The Bolivian Communist Party Central Committee's official newspaper, "Liberation Daily," published an article in the second half of April, calling on revolutionaries to fight for the people's cause.

	The article quotes Chairman Mao's teachings: "People will die eventually, but the significance of death varies. An ancient Chinese writer named Sima Qian once said, 'People are bound to die, but some die as heavy as Mount Tai, while others as light as a feather.' To die for the people's interests is heavier than Mount Tai; to die for the fascists, for those who exploit and oppress the people, is lighter than a feather. 'To struggle is to make sacrifices, and death is a common occurrence. But we think of the people's interests, of the suffering of the majority of the people. To die for the people is to die a worthy death.'"

	The article continues: "All revolutionaries, when considering the issue of life and death, should understand these truths."

	The article denounces revisionists who use so-called 'humanism' to advocate a reactionary philosophy of survival at any cost. The article states: "For them, the most important thing is to preserve their lives at any cost, so they oppose revolution and violence."

	The article says: "The most serious and stern test is, when the highest interests of the people require sacrifice, whether a person is ready to bravely die. This is our viewpoint, the Marxist-Leninist viewpoint of revolutionaries on the issue of life and death. All true revolutionaries understand life and death in this way; they have and will proudly sacrifice their lives for the people and the revolution. The death of each revolutionary is heavier than all the mountains because their deaths awaken the people. Every time a revolutionary falls, thousands and tens of thousands of people will take up their cause." The article concludes: "Under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the slogan of the Marxist-Leninists of Bolivia should be: Born for the people, die for the people."

### 为人民而生　为人民而死  玻共《解放报》号召革命者为人民的事业英勇战斗

    为人民而生　为人民而死
    玻共《解放报》号召革命者为人民的事业英勇战斗
    据新华社讯　拉巴斯消息：玻利维亚共产党中央委员会机关报《解放报》在四月下半月一期上发表文章，号召革命者为人民的事业而战斗。
    文章引用了毛主席的语录：“人总是要死的，但死的意义有不同。中国古时候有个文学家叫做司马迁的说过：‘人固有一死，或重于泰山，或轻于鸿毛。’为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重；替法西斯卖力，替剥削人民和压迫人民的人去死，就比鸿毛还轻。”“要奋斗就会有牺牲，死人的事是经常发生的。但是我们想到人民的利益，想到大多数人民的痛苦，我们为人民而死，就是死得其所。”
    文章接着指出：“所有的革命者，在考虑生与死的问题时，都应该领会这些真理。”
    文章谴责修正主义分子，抬出所谓“人道主义”来宣扬反动的活命哲学。文章说：“对于他们来说，最重要的是不惜任何代价求得活命，因此他们反对革命和暴力。”
    文章说：“最严肃的和最严峻的考验是，当人民的最高利益要求作出牺牲时，一个人是否准备勇敢地死去。这就是我们的观点，就是我们革命者对待生与死问题的态度的马列主义观点。一切真正的革命者就是这样理解生死观的，他们过去和现在为了人民和革命的利益骄傲地献出自己的生命；每个革命者的死，都比一切高山还要重，因为他们的死唤起了人民的觉悟。每当一个革命者倒下去了，就将有成千成万的人继承他的事业。”文章最后说：“在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，我们玻利维亚马列主义共产党人的口号应该是：为人民而生，为人民而死。”
