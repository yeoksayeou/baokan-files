The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Zhejiang Province, with boundless love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, have, after completing their overfulfillment of the procurement tasks for wheat and other crops, now launched a campaign to sell early rice to the state, striving to complete the early rice procurement task both swiftly and well. Up to now, the province's procurement volume has reached 70 percent, an increase over the same period last year. Some special districts, counties, and many production teams have already completed their early rice procurement tasks ahead of schedule and overfulfilled their quotas.

This year, Zhejiang's early rice harvest has been bountiful. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, mindful of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party in their time of plenty, have rushed to sell their patriotic grain to the state after threshing. They have carried red flags, held aloft portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao, beaten gongs and drums, and sung revolutionary songs, delivering the best grain to the state. The poor and lower-middle peasants of the Jinhua region have even proposed to sell "loyalty" grain to Chairman Mao. They have sifted and winnowed the "loyalty" grain repeatedly, ensuring it is free of weeds, impurities, and husks. Currently, after successfully completing the early rice procurement task, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in the entire special district have launched a campaign to sell surplus grain.

    浙江农村踊跃交售早稻
    浙江省广大贫下中农怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱和无限忠诚，继超额完成小麦等交售任务之后，现在又掀起了交售早稻的热潮，力争又快又好地完成早稻征购任务。到目前止，全省征购量已完成百分之七十，比去年同期有增加。部分专区、县和许多社队已提前和超额完成了早稻征购任务。
    浙江今年早稻又获得丰收。广大贫下中农丰收不忘毛主席，丰收不忘共产党。他们在稻谷登场后，争先恐后地向国家交售爱国粮。他们高举红旗，手捧伟大领袖毛主席画像，敲锣打鼓，高唱着革命歌曲，把最好的粮食交售给国家。金华地区贫下中农还提出向毛主席交售
  “忠”字粮。他们把“忠”字粮筛了又筛，扬了又扬，做到无稗、无杂、无谷壳。目前，全专区在胜利完成了早稻征购任务之后，广大贫下中农又掀起了多卖余粮的热潮。（据新华社讯）
