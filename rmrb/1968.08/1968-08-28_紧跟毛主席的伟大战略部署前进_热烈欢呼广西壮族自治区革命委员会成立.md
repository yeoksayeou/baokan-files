Under the powerful revolutionary force of the latest instructions from our great leader Chairman Mao, and amidst the triumphant songs of class struggle, following the establishment of revolutionary committees in Yunnan and Fujian, the revolutionary committee of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has been born in victory.

"The day the people rejoice is the day the counter-revolutionaries suffer." The establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee marks the complete failure of the Chinese Khrushchev, the counter-revolutionary two-faced traitor Tao Zhu, and the clique of capitalist roaders within the Party, including their agents in Central-South and Guangxi, Wang Renzhong, He Ximing, and Xie Wangang, in their attempt to restore capitalism. It also marks the complete failure of the counter-revolutionary plots of the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries. It delivers a resounding blow to the imperialist, revisionist, and reactionary insects who boasted that revolutionary committees could not be established in provinces and regions near China's borders.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has made great strategic deployments and wise decisions regarding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Guangxi. The establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought! It is a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

With hearts filled with boundless joy, we extend our warmest congratulations and revolutionary salutes to the 24 million people of all nationalities in Guangxi, and to the heroic People's Liberation Army stationed in Guangxi!

The history of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past two years has been both a great march of victories and a tortuous, arduous journey. Every step forward, every victory achieved, has required repeated struggles and fierce battles with the class enemy.

Guangxi is a frontline supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression. It was once a stronghold of the Kuomintang Guizhou warlords, and class struggle there is extremely sharp and complex. The enemy is extremely hostile and fearful of the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee. A small clique of spies, traitors, unrepentant capitalist roaders, untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, rightists, and other counter-revolutionaries have emerged, engaging in frenzied sabotage activities and creating a series of counter-revolutionary incidents in an attempt to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and obstruct the establishment of the revolutionary committee. However, under the immense power of the united revolutionary masses, their counter-revolutionary plots have shamefully failed. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Guangxi has achieved decisive victories.

The workers, peasants, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary Red Guards in Guangxi have been greatly tempered in the arduous and complex struggles against the class enemy. They have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, firmly stood on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, seriously implemented Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, persistently carried out the great criticism, consolidated and developed the great alliance and the three-in-one combination, and implemented Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness." The situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Guangxi is getting better and better.

The broad cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Guangxi have made tremendous contributions to the Cultural Revolution. While fulfilling the tasks of "supporting, assisting, and guiding," they have followed the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao to "spare no effort to annihilate the invading enemy," shot down multiple invading American planes, and dealt heavy blows to the war provocations of American imperialism, achieving one victory after another.

To closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments is to achieve victory. We hope that after the establishment of the Guangxi Revolutionary Committee, the people of all nationalities in Guangxi will continue to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, respond to Chairman Mao's great call, and do a good job in cleaning up the class ranks and, at the opportune moment, seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation.

Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "To carry out the proletarian educational revolution, it is necessary to have the leadership of the working class and the participation of the working masses, in conjunction with the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, to form a revolutionary three-in-one combination with the students, teachers, and workers in the school who are determined to carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end. The workers' propaganda teams should stay in the schools for a long time, participate in all the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and permanently lead the schools. In the countryside, the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants—should manage the schools."

"Establish revolutionary committees with a three-in-one combination, carry out great criticism, clean up the class ranks, rectify the party, streamline organizations, reform unreasonable regulations and systems, and transfer office personnel. In factories, the struggle, criticism, and transformation go through these stages."

Chairman Mao's latest instructions have extremely great strategic significance and point out the fundamental direction and path forward for us to complete the great historical task of struggle, criticism, and transformation. All levels of revolutionary committees, the proletarian revolutionary factions, and the broad masses of revolutionaries should, under the command of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and guided by Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, actively engage in the great struggle, criticism, and transformation according to the steps pointed out by Chairman Mao. For each task proposed by Chairman Mao, such as establishing revolutionary committees at all levels, carrying out great criticism, cleaning up the class ranks, rectifying the party, streamlining organizations, and educational revolution, etc., they should be discussed item by item, implemented item by item, and serious investigation and research should be conducted. Based on the specific situation of the Cultural Revolution in Guangxi, plans should be made and implemented.

The revolutionary committees at all levels in Guangxi, in leading the broad masses of revolutionaries to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, should fully play the leading role of the working class, fully play the role of the main force of workers, peasants, and soldiers, further carry out the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and vigorously establish various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Use Mao Zedong Thought to unify understanding, unify steps, and unify actions, and criticize the reactionary bourgeois "multi-center theory." They should heighten their revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold, strengthen their awareness of the enemy, mobilize the masses to thoroughly expose the counter-revolutionary crimes of a small clique of class enemies who attempt to sabotage proletarian dictatorship, sabotage socialist production, and sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They should strike firmly, accurately, and ruthlessly at American Kuomintang spies, Soviet revisionist spies, British spies, and other spy elements, traitors, unrepentant capitalist roaders, and untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. The military and civilians in Guangxi, located on the frontline of supporting Vietnam's struggle against American aggression, must strengthen their preparedness, guard the borders, coastal defenses, and air defenses, and resolutely, thoroughly, completely, and entirely annihilate any invading enemy.

The working class and the broad masses of revolutionaries in Guangxi should consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination according to systems, industries, and classes, smash the plots of a small clique of counter-revolutionaries to split the revolutionary ranks, and achieve victories in both revolution and production.

We are firmly convinced that the people of all nationalities in Guangxi and the People's Liberation Army stationed in Guangxi, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will definitely continue to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought fly over every battlefield!

    紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署前进
    ——热烈欢呼广西壮族自治区革命委员会成立
    《人民日报》《解放军报》社论
    在伟大领袖毛主席最新指示的强大革命威力下，在阶级斗争的凯歌声中，紧接着祖国西南边疆的云南和海防前线的福建两省成立革命委员会，广西壮族自治区革命委员会胜利诞生了。
      “人民大众开心之日，就是反革命分子难受之时。”广西壮族自治区革命委员会的成立，宣告了中国赫鲁晓夫、反革命两面派陶铸等党内最大的一小撮走资派以及他们在中南、广西的代理人王任重、贺希明、谢王岗之流妄图复辟资本主义的彻底破产，宣告了国民党反动派残渣余孽反革命罪恶阴谋的彻底破产，给了那些叫嚷“中国靠近边疆的省、区成立不了革命委员会”的帝、修、反的蠢虫们以迎头痛击。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席，对广西的无产阶级文化大革命，作了伟大的战略部署和英明的决策。广西壮族自治区革命委员会的成立，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利！
    我们满怀无比喜悦的心情，向广西二千四百万各族革命人民，向英雄的人民解放军驻广西部队，致以最热烈的祝贺和无产阶级文化大革命的战斗敬礼！
    两年多来无产阶级文化大革命的历史，既是胜利的伟大进军，又是曲折的艰巨里程。我们每前进一步，每取得一个胜利，都要同阶级敌人进行反复的较量、激烈的搏斗。
    广西是支援越南人民抗美斗争的前哨，过去是国民党桂系军阀的老巢，阶级斗争十分尖锐复杂。敌人对广西壮族自治区革命委员会的建立，极端仇视，极端害怕。一小撮特务、叛徒、顽固不化的走资派、没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右和其他反革命分子跳了出来，疯狂进行破坏活动，制造一系列反革命事件，妄图破坏无产阶级文化大革命，阻挠建立革命委员会。但是，在革命群众团结对敌的巨大威力下，他们的反革命阴谋可耻地失败了。广西的无产阶级文化大革命取得了决定性的胜利。
    广西的工农群众、革命干部和革命的红卫兵小将，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，在同阶级敌人进行的艰巨复杂的斗争中，得到了很大的锻炼。他们紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，认真落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，坚持地开展革命大批判，巩固和发展革命的大联合、革命的三结合，贯彻执行毛主席提出的
  “抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”的伟大方针，使广西地区的无产阶级文化大革命形势越来越好。
    中国人民解放军驻广西部队广大指战员，在文化大革命中作出了巨大的贡献。他们在完成“三支”“两军”任务的同时，遵照伟大领袖毛主席“全力以赴，务歼入侵之敌”的教导，多次击落入侵的美帝飞机，给了美帝国主义的战争挑衅以沉重的打击，取得了一个又一个的胜利。
    紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署就是胜利。我们希望：广西各族革命人民在广西革命委员会成立以后，要继续紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，响应毛主席的伟大号召，大力做好清理阶级队伍的工作，不失时机地认真搞好斗、批、改。
    毛主席最近指出：“实现无产阶级教育革命，必须有工人阶级领导，必须有工人群众参加，配合解放军战士，同学校的学生、教员、工人中决心把无产阶级教育革命进行到底的积极分子实行革命的三结合。工人宣传队要在学校中长期留下去，参加学校中全部斗、批、改任务，并且永远领导学校。在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校。”
    “建立三结合的革命委员会，大批判，清理阶级队伍，整党，精简机构、改革不合理的规章制度、下放科室人员，工厂里的斗、批、改，大体经历这么几个阶段。”
    毛主席的最新指示，有极其伟大的战略意义，为我们完成斗、批、改的伟大历史任务，指出了根本的方向和前进的道路。各级革命委员会，无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，要在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的号令下，在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，根据毛主席指出的各个步骤，积极地投入伟大的斗、批、改高潮。对毛主席提出的各项任务，即建立各级革委会、大批判、清理阶级队伍、整党、精简机构以及教育革命等等，要逐条讨论，逐条落实，进行认真的调查研究工作，根据广西文化大革命发展的具体情况，订出自己的规划，切实执行。
    广西各级革命委员会，在带领广大革命群众，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大斗争中，要充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用，充分发挥工农兵的主力军作用，进一步开展活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，大力办好各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，用毛泽东思想统一认识，统一步伐，统一行动，批判反动的资产阶级的“多中心论”。要百倍提高革命警惕，加强敌情观念，发动广大群众，彻底揭露一小撮阶级敌人妄图破坏无产阶级专政、破坏社会主义生产、破坏无产阶级文化大革命的反革命罪行，稳、准、狠地打击美蒋特务、苏修特务、英国特务和其他特务分子、叛徒、死不悔改的走资派，以及没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子。地处祖国边疆、援越抗美斗争前哨的广西军民，一定要大力加强战备，严守边防、海防和空防，坚决、彻底、干净、全部地消灭敢于来犯的敌人。
    广西的工人阶级和广大革命群众，都要巩固和发展按照系统、按照行业、按照班级的革命大联合和革命的三结合，粉碎一小撮反革命分子妄图分裂革命队伍的阴谋，夺取革命、生产双胜利。
    我们坚信，经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的广西各族革命人民和人民解放军驻广西部队，一定能够继续紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署前进，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍一切阵地！
