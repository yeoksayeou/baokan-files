Members of revolutionary committees at all levels and the broad masses of soldiers and civilians across the country have been deeply studying Comrade Lin Biao's important inscription and the August 1st editorial of the *People's Daily*, *Red Flag* magazine, and the *Liberation Army Daily*, titled "The Strong Pillar of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat." They have been greatly educated and inspired. Members of revolutionary committees and the revolutionary masses have expressed their determination to take the great People's Liberation Army as a shining example, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and build revolutionary committees at all levels into battle command centers that emphasize proletarian politics, closely link with the masses, and are full of revolutionary vigor. Broad masses of soldiers and civilians have expressed their determination to respond to the battle call of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Comrade Lin Biao, use Chairman Mao's proletarian military thought and Comrade Lin Biao's principles for political military building, help the broad revolutionary masses consolidate and develop revolutionary committees, further strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, and together with the revolutionary people of the entire country, achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Take the Great People's Liberation Army as a Shining Example
Study and Apply Chairman Mao's Thoughts in All Things

Members of revolutionary committees and the broad revolutionary masses across the country have seriously studied Comrade Lin Biao's important inscription and the August 1st important editorial. Everyone has deeply felt that, in accordance with the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, to "organize a revolutionary and mass-linked leadership cadre," the most fundamental thing is to be like the PLA in being absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, absolutely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in all things and implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions without the slightest deviation.

A responsible person from the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory Revolutionary Committee said, the great Chinese People's Liberation Army holds the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought highest, is most loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, is most closely linked with the broad masses of the people, and is most intimate with the proletarian revolutionary faction and the broad revolutionary people. The People's Liberation Army, under the personal cultivation and leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao and the direct command of Comrade Lin Biao, has formed glorious traditions and excellent styles in long-term revolutionary struggles. This is our nation's most precious wealth and is a shining example for all sectors to learn from. We must forever learn from the PLA and make our leadership cadre absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, advancing bravely on the path indicated by Chairman Mao. A responsible person from the Jianxi Jinggangshan Revolutionary Committee, linking his own struggle practice, said, at the most acute and intense moments of class struggle, comrades from the PLA used Mao Zedong Thought to help us observe and analyze the situation, boost our confidence and fighting spirit, and lead us to firmly grasp class struggle and not deviate. In the face of revolutionary victories, they again used Mao Zedong Thought to timely help us grasp the new characteristics and trends of class struggle, continue to launch fierce attacks on class enemies, and advance victoriously. We must be like the PLA in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and build the Jinggangshan Revolutionary Committee into a revolutionary battle command center that holds high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought. Members and revolutionary teachers and students of the Tianjin Yan'an Middle School reviewed their school's military training over more than a year. They said, the most fundamental and important help from the military training team was guiding them to study and apply Chairman Mao's works with the problems of the Cultural Revolution, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. They expressed their determination to take the People's Liberation Army as an example, firmly walk the path of proletarian political school construction. With the help of comrades from the PLA, the Revolutionary Committee of the Shenyang Metallurgical Powder Factory often holds "directional meetings," using Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the resolutions of the Gutian Conference to examine the work of the Revolutionary Committee, ensuring that they always emphasize proletarian politics in the midst of myriad tasks. Members of this factory's Revolutionary Committee expressed their determination to keep the work of the Revolutionary Committee forever on the track of Mao Zedong Thought. Members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Guizhou Red Star Tractor Factory said, the PLA is good in a thousand ways, but the best is studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. We learn a thousand things and ten thousand things from the PLA, but the most fundamental thing is to learn from the PLA to read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be good soldiers of Chairman Mao. Members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Guiyang Cotton Mill expressed their determination to better learn the experience of the PLA in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, carry forward the revolutionary learning style of combining theory with practice, and turn the Guiyang Cotton Mill into a fiery school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Take the Great People's Liberation Army as a Shining Example
Forever Maintain Blood-and-Flesh Ties with the People

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "Stand firmly with the Chinese people, serve the Chinese people wholeheartedly, this is the sole purpose of this army." Members of revolutionary committees across the country highly praise the People's Liberation Army, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, as an army that serves the people wholeheartedly, and as soldiers of the people who are forever linked with the broad revolutionary masses in blood and flesh, fish and water. They expressed their determination to take the great People's Liberation Army as a shining example, carry forward the Party's style of closely linking with the masses, and truly do as the great leader Chairman Mao teaches, "serve the people wholeheartedly and never leave the masses for a moment."

Members of the Beijing Railway Bureau's revolutionary committees at all levels, in study and discussion sessions, said, the People's Liberation Army is a highly revolutionary and closely mass-linked people's army, and is our best example to learn from. The revolutionization of our revolutionary committee leadership cadre is to be like the PLA, to be absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, absolutely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, to serve the people wholeheartedly, and to forever maintain blood-and-flesh ties with the masses. Only in this way can the newly born proletarian revolutionary power be built as firmly as steel and forever retain revolutionary youth. Military representatives in the Revolutionary Committee of Shandong Province's Xintai County brought the PLA's glorious tradition of closely linking with the masses into the Revolutionary Committee. They carried their backpacks, went wherever there was work, solved problems wherever there were issues, and launched attacks on class enemies wherever class struggle was most intense. The broad revolutionary masses affectionately called them "old Eighth Route Army soldiers." Other members of this county's Revolutionary Committee deeply felt that the PLA used Mao Zedong Thought to guide us onto the path of revolutionization. Because we often live among the masses at the grassroots level, there is less and less political dust in our minds. Revolutionary teachers and students of Zhengzhou's No. 19 Middle School said, military representatives in their school's Revolutionary Committee often appeared among the revolutionary masses as ordinary soldiers, their voices were heard in study classes, their sweat was seen in labor sites, and their footprints were found in kitchens. The masses all regarded them as confidants. Other members of this school's Revolutionary Committee expressed their determination to, together with military representatives in the Revolutionary Committee, insist on the mass line in all things and forever maintain close ties with the broad revolutionary teachers and students. Members of the Revolutionary Committee of Wuhan's No. 3 Cotton Mill said, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, emphasizing proletarian politics, closely linking with the masses, insisting on the Four Firsts, carrying forward the Three-Eight Style, is the excellent tradition of the People's Liberation Army and the precious wealth of our Party. We must learn it well and carry it forward, making our proletarian revolutionary power forever red and never change color.

Let Chairman Mao's Military Thought and Comrade Lin Biao's Principles for Political Military Building Take Root, Bloom, and Bear Fruit in the Newly Born Revolutionary Committees

"The army is the main component of state power." Broad masses of soldiers and civilians of the People's Liberation Army stationed across the country, while deeply studying Comrade Lin Biao's inscription and the August 1st editorial, further deeply realized that the People's Liberation Army bears great responsibilities in consolidating and developing revolutionary committees and further strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat. They determined to better bring Chairman Mao's proletarian military thought and Comrade Lin Biao's principles of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, emphasizing proletarian politics, insisting on the Four Firsts, carrying forward the Three-Eight Style, carrying out the Three Democracies, and promoting the Four Good Campaigns into revolutionary committees, use them in power construction, and build revolutionary committees into revolutionary and mass-linked leadership cadres. Many soldiers and civilians fighting on the front lines of "Three Supports, Two Military" and military representatives in revolutionary committees at all levels said, the fundamental issue of revolution is the issue of power. Consolidating and developing revolutionary committees is in the fundamental interests of the people of the entire country and is the overall situation of the revolution. We must definitely bring the communist ideology that Chairman Mao personally cultivated in our army and the advanced institutions and excellent styles of the proletariat that he personally established into the Revolutionary Committee, help the Revolutionary Committee achieve ideological revolutionization and organizational revolutionization. They expressed their determination to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and be good examples of revolutionary and mass-linked cadres.

Soldiers and civilians of the PLA stationed in Beijing's Knitting General Factory, New China Printing Factory, Tianjin Yan'an Middle School, and other units, and soldiers and civilians of the "Model Platoon for Supporting the Left and Loving the People" pointed out, the August 1st editorial conveys the voice of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Comrade Lin Biao, proposes the new battle tasks of the People's Liberation Army in the new situation, and is a guiding light for the entire army to better do the "Three Supports, Two Military" work. We must definitely implement it resolutely. We must further bring the excellent traditions of our army cultivated by Chairman Mao into the Revolutionary Committee, help the Revolutionary Committee study and apply Chairman Mao's works in all things, and lead the revolutionary masses to achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Military representatives in the Revolutionary Committees of Fengfeng Coal Mine, Jiangyin County, and Pinggu County, from the day they participated in the work of the Revolutionary Committee, have orally and practically brought the glorious traditions of the PLA into the Revolutionary Committee. They said, the most fundamental thing for military representatives in the Revolutionary Committee is to grasp the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought, making the Revolutionary Committee forever advance bravely on the course indicated by Chairman Mao and become a strong fighting collective that is absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, absolutely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The heroic Red First Company established by the great commander Chairman Mao on Jinggangshan, the company where the special hero Yang Renshi was once stationed, the company where the great communist warrior Liu Yingjun was once stationed, and the soldiers and civilians of the 12th Station of a certain unit of the South China Fleet, as well as broad masses of soldiers and civilians fighting on the front lines of "Three Supports, Two Military," studied the editorial and implemented actions, widely launching activities to make new contributions to consolidating and developing the Revolutionary Committee. Many units sent Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to help the Revolutionary Committee further establish political and ideological work systems, maintain blood-and-flesh ties with the masses, and truly do "unite with the broad masses, the more the better." They expressed their determination to use their greatest efforts to make Chairman Mao's military thought and Comrade Lin Biao's principles for political military building take root, bloom, and bear fruit in the newly born Revolutionary Committee.

In the Mass Movement, Study and Apply Mao Zedong Thought and Continuously Improve Awareness of the Struggle Between the Two Lines

Comrade Lin Biao pointed out: "The work of the army is complex, as long as we vigorously study and apply Chairman Mao's works and grasp the education of the struggle between the two lines, all problems can be solved." While actively contributing to consolidating and developing the Revolutionary Committee, soldiers and civilians of various units widely brought the problems of the struggle between the two lines to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, went to the masses to learn, and continuously improved their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. They said, only by raising the awareness of the struggle between the two lines can we better do the "Three Supports, Two Military" work and further play the strong pillar role of the People's Liberation Army.

Before August 1st, the Jiangxi Military Region held a Mao Zedong Thought study class in the form of a political camp, camping in Jinggangshan to learn from the people of the old revolutionary base area. The students learned as they went, deeply feeling that the people are the source of power for the revolutionary government. The People's Liberation Army must always maintain blood-and-flesh ties with the people to become the strong pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The "Linfeng Brigade" of a certain regiment of the "Three Supports, Two Military" forces in Nanjing had previously held 245 Mao Zedong Thought study classes in 23 units. Amidst the praise of the masses, the regiment's party committee repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on humility and close ties with the masses. To strengthen learning from the masses, the party committee adopted the methods of "going out" and "inviting in," widely soliciting the opinions of the masses. They said, the more victorious the situation, the more we must adopt a dialectical attitude towards our work, and the more we must humbly listen to the opinions and criticisms of the masses. Many soldiers and civilians on the front lines of "Three Supports, Two Military" deeply felt from practice that their process of executing the "Three Supports, Two Military" tasks was a process of going to the masses to study Mao Zedong Thought and using Mao Zedong Thought in the masses. Soldiers and officers of the "Model Red Ninth Company" and the "Hard-Boned Sixth Company" believed that the two years since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution were the two years they experienced the great storms and broad scenes of mass struggle, the two years they went to the masses and, with the help of the masses, carried out the revolutionary construction of the company. A soldier of the Sixth Company deeply felt that in our extensive contact with the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary Red Guards, we have a deeper understanding of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Soldiers and civilians of the "Red Spearhead Company" on the front line of Fujian, the "Model Company for Military and Political Victory" on the border of Yunnan, the "Heroic Company of Huangcaoling" in Guangzhou, the "Sea Tiger Boat" of a certain unit of the Navy, and the class where Lu Xiangbi was once stationed in a certain unit of the Air Force all expressed their determination to continue to seriously learn from the working class, poor and lower-middle peasants, and the broad revolutionary masses, forever be students of the masses, insist on going to the masses to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, continuously improve the awareness of the struggle between the two lines, and make new contributions to achieving comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Soldiers and civilians of a certain company of the 8325th Unit seriously studied and enthusiastically discussed the important editorial "The Strong Pillar of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat" published in the *People's Daily*, *Red Flag* magazine, and the *Liberation Army Daily*, determined to carry forward the glorious traditions of the People's Liberation Army, heighten revolutionary vigilance, defend the motherland and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and make new contributions to the people!

    以伟大的人民解放军为光辉榜样
    时时事事活学活用毛泽东思想
    各地革委会成员和广大革命群众认真学习了林副主席的重要题词和“八一”重要社论，大家深刻地体会到，要按照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，使各级革委会“组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子”，最根本的一条就是要象解放军那样无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席的革命路线，时时事事活学活用毛泽东思想，不折不扣地落实毛主席的一系列最新指示。
    上海机床厂革委会负责人说，伟大的中国人民解放军，毛泽东思想伟大红旗举得最高，对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线最忠，联系广大人民群众最紧，对无产阶级革命派和广大革命人民最亲。人民解放军在伟大领袖毛主席的亲自培育和领导下，在林副主席的直接指挥下，在长期的革命斗争中，形成了光荣的传统和优良作风。这是我们全国人民最宝贵的财富，是各行各业学习的光辉榜样。我们要永远向解放军学习，使我们的领导班子无限忠于毛主席，沿着毛主席指引的道路奋勇前进。江西井冈山革委会负责人联系自己的斗争实践说，在阶级斗争最尖锐最激烈的关键时刻，解放军同志用毛泽东思想帮助我们观察和分析形势，鼓舞我们的信心和斗志，带领我们狠抓阶级斗争不转向。在革命取得节节胜利的大好形势下，他们又用毛泽东思想及时帮助我们掌握阶级斗争的新特点、新动向，继续向阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻，乘胜前进。我们一定要象解放军那样活学活用毛泽东思想，把井冈山革委会建设成为高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的革命战斗指挥部。天津延安中学的革委会成员和革命师生，回顾了他们学校实行军训一年多来的战斗历程。他们说，军训团对我们最根本、最重要的帮助，就是引导我们带着文化大革命中的问题活学活用毛主席著作，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。他们表示，一定要以人民解放军为榜样，坚定地走无产阶级政治建校的道路。沈阳市冶金粉末厂革委会在解放军同志的帮助下，经常召开“定向会”，用毛主席的最新指示和古田会议决议检查革委会的工作，保证了他们在千头万绪的工作中始终突出无产阶级政治。这个厂的革委会成员表示，一定要让革委会的工作永远不脱离毛泽东思想的轨道。贵州红星拖拉机厂的革委会成员说，解放军千好万好，活学活用毛主席著作最好。我们向解放军学千条学万条，学习解放军读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士，是最根本的一条。贵阳棉纺厂革委会的成员们表示，一定要更好地把解放军活学活用毛泽东思想的经验学到手，发扬理论联系实际的革命学风，把贵阳棉纺厂办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    以伟大的人民解放军为光辉榜样
    永远和人民群众保持血肉联系
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“紧紧地和中国人民站在一起，全心全意地为中国人民服务，就是这个军队的唯一的宗旨。”各地革委会成员热烈赞颂用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民解放军是全心全意为人民服务的军队，是永远和广大革命群众血肉相连、鱼水相依的人民子弟兵。他们表示，一定要以伟大的人民解放军为光辉榜样，发扬党的紧密联系群众的作风，真正做到象伟大领袖毛主席所教导的那样，“全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众”。
    北京铁路分局所属各级革委会成员们在学习座谈中说，人民解放军是非常革命化的、紧密联系群众的人民军队，是我们学习的最好榜样。我们革委会的领导班子的革命化，就是要象解放军那样，化在无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席革命路线上，化在全心全意为人民服务上，化在永远和群众保持血肉联系上。只有这样，新生的无产阶级革命政权才能建设得象钢铁般巩固，永葆革命的青春。山东省新泰县革命委员会中的军队代表，把解放军密切联系群众的光荣传统带进了革委会。他们背着背包，那里有事就在那里办，那里有问题就到那里去解决，那里阶级斗争最激烈就到那里发动群众，向阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻。
　　广大革命群众亲切地称呼他们是“老八路”。这个县的革委会其他成员深有体会地说，解放军用毛泽东思想把我们引上了革命化的道路。我们由于经常生活在基层群众之中，头脑里的政治灰尘越来越少了。郑州十九中学的革命师生说，他们学校革委会的军队代表经常以普通一兵的身份出现在革命群众之中，学习班上有他的声音，劳动场地有他的汗水，炊事房里有他的足迹，群众都把他当成知心人。这个学校的革委会其他成员表示，一定要同革委会的军队代表一起，事事、处处坚持群众路线，永远和广大革命师生保持密切联系。武汉国棉三厂革委会的成员们说，活学活用毛主席著作，突出无产阶级政治，密切联系群众，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风，是人民解放军的优良传统，是我们党的宝贵财富，我们一定要学到手，一定要发扬光大，使我们的无产阶级革命政权千秋万代永不变色。
    让毛主席建军思想和林副主席政治建军原则在新生的革命委员会中生根、开花、结果
    “军队是国家政权的主要成份。”人民解放军驻各地的部队广大指战员，在深入学习林副主席题词和“八一”社论的时候，进一步深刻地认识到，人民解放军在巩固和发展革命委员会，进一步加强无产阶级专政的伟大斗争中，负有重大的责任。他们决心更好地把毛主席的无产阶级建军思想，把林副主席提出的活学活用毛主席著作，突出无产阶级政治，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风，发扬三大民主，开展四好连队运动等方针原则，带进革命委员会，运用到政权建设中去，把革委会建设成为革命化的联系群众的领导班子。许多战斗在“三支”“两军”第一线上的指战员和各级革命委员会的军队代表说，革命的根本问题是政权问题。巩固、发展革命委员会，是全国人民的根本利益所在，是革命的大局。一定要把毛主席在我军亲手培育的共产主义思想，亲自创立的无产阶级的先进制度和优良作风带进革委会，帮助革委会实现思想革命化和组织革命化。他们表示，一定要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，做革命化的联系群众的好样子。
    驻北京针织总厂、新华印刷厂、天津延安中学等单位的解放军支左人员和“支左爱民模范排”的指战员们指出，“八一”社论传达了以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的声音，提出了人民解放军在新形势下的新的战斗任务，是照耀全军进一步做好“三支”“两军”工作的指路明灯，一定要坚决贯彻执行。我们要进一步把毛主席亲自培育的我军的优良传统带进革委会，帮助革委会时时、事事、处处活学活用毛主席著作，带领革命群众夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。峰峰煤矿、江阴县和平谷县革委会的军队代表，从参加革委会工作的那天起，就口传身授，把解放军的光荣传统带进了革委会。他们说，军队代表在革委会里最根本的就是要抓好活学活用、学好用好毛泽东思想，使革委会永远沿着毛主席指引的航向奋勇前进，成为无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席革命路线的坚强战斗集体。伟大统帅毛主席在井冈山亲手建立的英雄红一连，特级英雄杨根思生前所在连队，伟大的共产主义战士刘英俊生前所在的连队和南海舰队某部十二站的指战员，以及战斗在“三支”“两军”第一线的广大指战员，学习社论，落实行动，广泛展开了为巩固和发展革委会立新功的活动。许多单位派出了毛泽东思想宣传队，帮助革委会进一步建立政治思想工作制度，保持和群众的血肉联系，真正做到“团结广大人民，团结得越多越好。”他们表示，一定要尽最大的力量，让毛主席的建军思想和林副主席关于政治建军的方针原则，在新生的革委会中生根、开花、结果。
    在群众运动中活学活用毛泽东思想不断努力提高两条路线斗争的觉悟
    林彪副主席指出：“部队工作千头万绪，只要大力活学活用毛主席著作，抓好两条路线斗争的教育，一切问题就可以迎刃而解。”各部队指战员在积极为巩固、发展革委会贡献力量的时候，广泛带着两条路线斗争的问题，活学活用毛主席著作，到斗争实践中去向群众学习，不断努力提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟。他们说，只有把两条路线斗争的觉悟提得高高的，才能更好地做好“三支”“两军”工作，进一步发挥人民解放军的强大支柱作用。
    江西省军区在“八一”前夕，以政治野营形式办了一期毛泽东思想学习班，到井冈山野营，向老根据地的人民群众学习。学员们走一路，学一路，深深体会到，人民群众是革命政权力量的源泉。人民解放军要成为无产阶级专政的坚强柱石，必须始终同人民群众保持血肉的联系。在南京执行“三支”
  “两军”任务的“临汾旅”某团机枪三连，曾先后在二十三个单位办了二百四十五期毛泽东思想学习班。在群众的赞扬声中，连队党支部反复学习了毛主席关于戒骄戒躁和密切联系群众的教导。他们为了加强向群众学习，党支部采取了“走出去”“请进来”的办法，广泛征求群众的意见。他们说，越是在胜利的情况下，越是要对自己的工作采取一分为二的态度，越要虚心倾听群众的意见和批评。许多“三支”“两军”第一线上的部队指战员，从实践中深深体会到，他们执行“三支”“两军”任务的过程，就是到群众中去学习毛泽东思想，到群众中去运用毛泽东思想的过程。“学习毛主席著作的模范红九连”和“硬骨头六连”的干部和战士认为，无产阶级文化大革命以来的两年，是他们经“群众斗争的大风雨”、见“群众斗争的大世面”的两年，是他们到群众中去、在群众的帮助下搞连队革命化建设的两年。六连战士深有体会地说，我们在同广大革命群众和革命的红卫兵小将广泛接触中，对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线有了更加深刻的理解。福建前线某部“红色尖刀连”、云南边疆某部“军政双胜模范连”、广州某部“黄草岭英雄连”、海军某部“海上猛虎艇”，以及空军某部吕祥璧生前所在班等单位的指战员们，纷纷表示，要继续认真地向工人阶级、贫下中农和广大革命群众学习，永远当群众的小学生，坚持到群众中去活学活用毛主席著作，不断提高两条路线斗争的觉悟，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利立新功。（附图片）
