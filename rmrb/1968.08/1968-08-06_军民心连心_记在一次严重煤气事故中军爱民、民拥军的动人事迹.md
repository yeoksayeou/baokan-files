On March 31, 1968, a Sunday, all revolutionary workers of the First Automobile Works were resolutely implementing the great leader Chairman Mao's directive of "grasping revolution and promoting production." They were steadfastly at their posts. Amidst the factory's bustling atmosphere and frequent reports of victories, an unfortunate piece of news suddenly arrived: the cook, Gao Chenghe, from the twelfth canteen had been overcome by a high concentration of industrial coal gas while repairing a gas valve and had fallen into a three-meter-deep coal gas well.

The soldiers of the Red Third Company, stationed at the factory to support the leftists, were discussing the organization of a Mao Zedong Thought study class with the revolutionary masses of the kitchen brigade. Upon hearing the news, Yang Siming rushed to the edge of the gas well. Several cooks were about to descend into the well. Yang Siming shouted, "Let me go!" and immediately jumped down into the well. Yang Siming used all his strength to lift Gao with both hands, but due to the depth of the well and the high concentration of gas, he struggled to lift him several times but could not hold on. Finally, he also collapsed.

"Soldiers have fainted in the well while rescuing workers!" In an instant, many revolutionary workers gathered around the twelfth canteen, eager to descend into the well to rescue their comrades.

At this critical moment, revolutionary worker Wang Qingyi, who had just returned from supporting the construction in the mountains and was resting, rushed to the well in three strides. Wang Qingyi thought, "Time is life, soldiers are our comrades, even if it costs my life, I must save him!" He swiftly jumped into the well, grabbing Yang Siming's belt and shirt. He immediately felt breathless and his head swelled. He tried to lift Yang Siming, but his limbs were paralyzed and he could not lift him. He also collapsed.

In less than thirty minutes, the soldier had fainted while rescuing the worker, and the worker had fainted while rescuing the soldier. In total, three people had fainted in the well.

At this critical moment, the gas rescue team from the factory, equipped with gas masks, arrived at the scene and rescued the three comrades from the gas well. With hearts full of concern for their class brothers, they carried them to the emergency room of the factory hospital.

Upon hearing the news, all the revolutionary workers of the factory surged towards the emergency room like a tide, each one eager to donate their blood to save their class brothers' lives!

The emergency room instantly turned into a battlefield for rescuing comrades. The entire medical staff of the outpatient department quickly formed a rescue command group.

During the rescue of Yang Siming, more than ten medical staff members took turns performing artificial respiration on him, despite their fatigue. Time passed minute by minute, but Yang Siming's heart did not beat.

Artificial respiration and other measures were no longer effective. Blood transfusion through the artery was needed. More and more revolutionary masses gathered to show their concern for the rescue. An old man rushed forward, tears streaming down his face, and grabbed the blood type test sheet from someone else, insisting on donating blood for his comrade. A worker, tears in his eyes, pleaded with the medical staff, "Today, Yang Siming's heroic deed made me think of Lei Feng, Liu Yingjun, and Li Wenzhong. No matter what, we must save our comrade, the soldier!"

Despite all efforts, because Yang Siming was severely poisoned, his blood had started to coagulate, and plasma could no longer be infused. It was impossible to save Yang Siming. However, the revolutionary masses did not believe he would die. They sent Yang Siming to the inpatient department and then to a military hospital more than ten miles away from the factory. After repeated examinations, the medical staff had to announce with great sorrow, "Yang Siming has died a glorious death!"

Everyone bid a sorrowful farewell to Yang Siming's body. Revolutionary workers, holding copies of the "Little Red Book," solemnly swore before the martyr's body, "Yang Siming, we will follow your example, step by step, closely following Chairman Mao, with hearts red and true to Chairman Mao, fighting to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in life, and sacrificing to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in death!"

While rescuing Yang Siming, the medical staff in the emergency room were also urgently rescuing the revolutionary worker Wang Qingyi, who was in a state of extreme coma. Thanks to the timely support from the military hospital and the tireless efforts of the medical staff, he was finally rescued from the brink of death.

During Wang Qingyi's hospitalization, the leaders and comrades from the unit where Yang Siming had served visited him multiple times, bringing him golden Mao badges and portraits of Chairman Mao, encouraging him to recover well with Mao Zedong Thought. Wang Qingyi, moved, said, "After I recover, I will definitely learn from the soldiers and become a good worker for Chairman Mao." He also hung the portrait of Chairman Mao sent by the soldiers on his bed, so that he could see Chairman Mao's great image whenever he got up, went out, or returned.

When Wang Qingyi was able to get out of bed, he insisted on visiting Yang Siming. At this time, his comrades had to tell him, "Yang Siming has died a glorious death, and Gao Chenghe has also died in the line of duty!" Upon hearing this sad news, he said with tears, "Yang Siming has not died; he still lives in the hearts of our automobile workers!" He decided to turn his sorrow into strength, forever learn from the great People's Liberation Army, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and carry the revolution to the end!

The heroic deeds of soldier Yang Siming and revolutionary worker Wang Qingyi are being widely praised in Changchun City. At the celebration of the 41st anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army, the Changchun Municipal Revolutionary Committee announced the posthumous awarding of the title "Good Soldier Loyal to Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line" and "Model of Loving the People" to Yang Siming, and the title "Good Worker Loyal to Chairman Mao" and "Model of Supporting the Army" to Wang Qingyi.

　　军民心连心
　　——记在一次严重煤气事故中军爱民、民拥军的动人事迹
    一九六八年三月三十一日，是星期天。第一汽车制造厂的全体革命职工，坚决贯彻执行伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的方针，坚守在战斗岗位上。在全厂一片热气腾腾、捷报频传的凯歌声中，突然传来一个不幸的消息：十二食堂炊事员高承和因修理煤气阀门，被浓度很大的工业煤气熏倒，掉进三米深的煤气井里了。
    驻厂担任支左任务的解放军某部红三连战士杨世民，正在和炊事班的革命群众研究举办毛泽东思想学习班的事。他闻讯以后，飞也似地跑到煤气井边。几个炊事员正要下井。只听见杨世民高喊一声：“让我来！”随着就纵身跳下井去。杨世民同志用尽全身力气双手抱住高师傅要向上举，但因井深，煤气浓度太大，他竭尽全力地连举几次，都支撑不住，最后也昏倒了。
    “解放军为抢救工人被熏倒在井里了！”顷刻间，许多革命职工都聚集到十二食堂周围，争先恐后地要下井抢救亲人。
    这时，支援山区建设回来休养的革命工人王庆义同志，三步并作两步，冲到井边。王庆义想：“时间就是生命，解放军是亲人，豁出命来，也要把他救出来！”他闪电般地纵身跳下井去，刚抓住杨世民的腰带和上衣，就感到呼吸困难，头脑发胀。他想用力把杨世民举起，可是四肢瘫软了，再也举不起来了，他也昏倒了。
    在不足三十分钟的时间里，解放军战士为了抢救工人熏倒了，工人又去抢救解放军战士也熏倒了。前后三个人都熏倒在井里了。
    在这紧急关头，厂煤气救护站的同志带着防毒面具，赶到了现场，才把三个同志从煤气井里救上来。人们怀着无比关心阶级兄弟的心情，把他们抬到了厂医院门诊部的急诊室。
    全厂的革命职工闻讯以后，象潮水一样地涌向门诊部，人人要求献出自己的鲜血，夺回阶级兄弟的生命！
    急诊室顿时变成了抢救亲人的战场。门诊部全体医护人员，以战斗的姿态，迅速组成了抢救亲人的战斗指挥小组。
    在抢救杨世民同志的时候，有十几名医务人员不顾疲劳地轮换着给他作人工呼吸。时间一分分地过去了，杨世民的心脏仍然没有跳动。
    人工呼吸等措施已经不行了，需要切开动脉输血。关心抢救亲人的革命群众越来越多，有个老大爷闻讯赶来，流着泪水挤到前面，抢过别人的血型化验单，要求给亲人输血。一位工人含着热泪对医护人员恳求说：“今天杨世民同志的英雄行为，使我看到了雷锋、刘英俊、李文忠，无论如何要救活亲人解放军啊！”
    尽管经过千方百计的抢救，因为杨世民同志中毒过分严重，血液开始凝结，血浆已经输不进去了，救活杨世民同志是不可能了。可是，革命群众不相信他会死。他们又把杨世民同志送到住院部，又从住院部送到离厂十多里的驻军某医院去。经过反复地检查，医护人员不得不以万分悲痛的心情说：“杨世民同志已经光荣地牺牲了！”
    大家怀着无比沉痛的心情，向杨世民烈士的遗体告别。革命职工们手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，在烈士遗体前庄严宣誓：“杨世民同志，我们一定要象你那样，步步紧跟毛主席，颗颗红心向着毛主席，生为捍卫毛主席的革命路线而战斗，死为捍卫毛主席的革命路线而献身！”
    在抢救杨世民同志的同时，急诊室的医护人员，也在紧张地抢救处于极度昏迷状态的革命工人王庆义。由于得到驻军某医院的及时支援，由于医护人员的百般抢救治疗，他终于被从死亡的边缘抢救了过来。
    在王庆义住院期间，杨世民同志生前所在部队的首长和同志们，曾多次到医院慰问他，给他送来金光闪闪的毛主席像章和毛主席画像，并用毛泽东思想鼓励他好好疗养。王庆义同志激动地表示：“我好了以后，一定更好地向解放军同志学习，做毛主席的好工人。”他还把解放军送的毛主席画像贴在床前，以便起床，出去，回来，都能先看见毛主席的伟大形象。
    当王庆义刚刚能够下床活动时，他就坚决要去看望杨世民。这时，同志们才不得不告诉他：“杨世民同志已经光荣牺牲了，高承和师傅也因公殉职了！”他听到这个不幸的消息以后，含着热泪说：“杨世民同志没有死，他仍然活在我们汽车工人的心中！”他决心把悲痛化为力量，永远向伟大的人民解放军学习，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，将革命进行到底！
    解放军战士杨世民和革命工人王庆义的英雄事迹，正在长春市被广为传颂。长春市革命委员会在庆祝中国人民解放军建军四十一周年的大会上，宣布追授杨世民同志以“无限忠于毛主席革命路线的好战士、爱民模范”的光荣称号，授予王庆义同志以“忠于毛主席的好工人、拥军模范”的光荣称号。
