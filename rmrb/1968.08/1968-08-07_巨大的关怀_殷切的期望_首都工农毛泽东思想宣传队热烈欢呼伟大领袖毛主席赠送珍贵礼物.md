The capital city's workers and peasants Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams enthusiastically acclaim the great leader Chairman Mao's gift of precious items

On August 5, 1968, Tsinghua University was in an uproar, and Beijing was in an uproar!

On the joyous day marking the second anniversary of Chairman Mao's "Bombard the Headquarters" big-character poster and the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," our great teacher, great leader Chairman Mao, presented a precious gift of mangoes to the capital city's workers and peasants Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams at Tsinghua University.

This great piece of news spread to every corner of Tsinghua University and reached the hearts of the workers of the capital and the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Wherever the news spread, there was a wave of cheers:

"Chairman Mao's gift of precious items is the greatest concern, the greatest encouragement, the greatest support, and the greatest spur for us!"

"Long live our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years!"

"Wishing our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!"

In Tsinghua University, the revolutionary fighters of the capital city's workers and peasants Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams gathered around the precious mangoes gifted by the great leader Chairman Mao, looking and smelling them again and again. With tears of infinite happiness, they held meetings and parades to express their loyalty to Chairman Mao. Many people wrote letters and made phone calls overnight to spread this great piece of news to their comrades and families.

On the streets of the capital, banners enthusiastically acclaiming the great leader Chairman Mao's gift of precious items appeared one after another. Teams of revolutionary workers, students, and soldiers rushed to Tsinghua University to congratulate the capital city's workers and peasants Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams. Many people also specially went to Zhongnanhai to express their determination to Chairman Mao.

In many factories, after hearing this great piece of news, the revolutionary workers cheered enthusiastically and sang joyfully. At the celebration meetings and in their declarations, they solemnly vowed to Chairman Mao, determined to turn Chairman Mao's great concern into an endless source of spiritual strength to drive them forward to victory.

The revolutionary fighters of the capital city's workers and peasants Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams excitedly said, "Our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao cares the most about us, the working class, and the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and supports our revolutionary actions the most. Chairman Mao is always with us, heart to heart. Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, relying on us, the working class, and the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. In the proletarian educational revolution, Chairman Mao also wants us, the working class, and the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, to charge forward together with revolutionary teachers, students, and staff. Based on Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, we formed the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams and came to Tsinghua University. Together with the revolutionary Red Guards and revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of this school, we have just achieved some results in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Chairman Mao then presented us with precious gifts. This is another great support and trust from him for us, the working class, and the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers! With great leader Chairman Mao backing us, we must make Chairman Mao proud!"

At the moment of receiving the precious gift from the great leader Chairman Mao, some revolutionary workers from the Beijing No. 1 Rolling Mill recalled the glorious day of August 10, 1966. It was on this glorious day that they, together with the revolutionary masses of the capital, happily received the reception from the great commander Chairman Mao and personally heard Chairman Mao's great battle cry: "You must pay attention to state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" Over the past two years, under the inspiration of Chairman Mao's great battle cry, they and the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers have fully played the role of the main force in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, achieving one victory after another. Now, on the great journey of seizing the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they have joined the capital city's workers and peasants Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams and appeared in Tsinghua University in the posture of the main force of the proletarian educational revolution. These revolutionary workers said, looking at Chairman Mao's precious gift, it was as if Chairman Mao was standing by our side, commanding us to fight!

The great news of Chairman Mao's gift of precious items stirred even stronger reactions among many old workers in the capital city's workers and peasants Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams. They were deprived of the right to study and read by the old society, and they had long been dissatisfied with the situation where China's Khrushchev had long maintained the rule of the bourgeois intellectuals in the schools. Now, after two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they, with their profound proletarian feelings of being infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to the great Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, stepped into the university campus with their heads held high. Together with the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of Tsinghua University, they propagated and implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, determined to change the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling the schools with their own hands, and carry out the proletarian educational revolution. This is such a glorious political task! Xu Dezhu, a member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Beijing Transformer Factory and a worker representative, had five out of eight family members killed in their lives before liberation. She had never attended a single day of school. This active learner of Chairman Mao's works, after participating in the capital city's workers and peasants Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams and coming to Tsinghua University, has been enthusiastically propagating Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Looking at the mangoes gifted by Chairman Mao, she was so moved that tears welled up in her eyes, and she repeatedly shouted: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years! She said: "Chairman Mao sent us mangoes, which is a great trust and deep expectation for us! With the great leader Chairman Mao guiding us, we must be able to quickly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions together with the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of Tsinghua University, carry out the educational revolution well, and turn Tsinghua University into a red Mao Zedong Thought university!"

Every heart turns to Chairman Mao, every sunflower turns to the red sun. After two years of tempering in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and growing up under the radiance of Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts, the workers of the capital city are forever loyal to Chairman Mao, closely rallying around the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. They were particularly moved when they learned of the great news of Chairman Mao's gift of mangoes.

The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Knitting Factory looked at the precious gift sent by Chairman Mao, their hearts surged with emotions and tears of joy. Workers participating in the capital city's workers and peasants Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams and those in the factory held grand celebration meetings. The workers said: Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! It was the PLA you sent who, following your consistent teachings, firmly implemented the three principles of supporting the left, bringing your brilliant thoughts to us, making the red sun shine on the Beijing Knitting Factory. Today, you, the old man, sent us the most precious gift, encouraging us to continue moving forward. Reviewing our victorious journey, every step was guided by you, the old man; summarizing our victorious experience, the most fundamental point is: closely unite around the proletarian headquarters, with unified will, unified steps, and unified actions under the orders of the proletarian headquarters, firmly and unshakably implement your old man's series of latest instructions. The revolutionary workers expressed their determination to firmly criticize the reactionary "multi-center theory," be more loyal to the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. We not only want to grasp the revolution and promote production in our factory but also want to learn from the PLA's experience in implementing the three principles of supporting the left in our work of participating in the capital city's workers and peasants Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, carry out in-depth, detailed, patient, and persistent propaganda work, truly turn Mao Zedong Thought into the actual actions of the broad revolutionary masses. This is the fundamental guarantee for achieving a thorough victory in the educational revolution.

On the joyous day of celebrating Chairman Mao's gift of precious items, the revolutionary workers of the Beijing New China Printing Factory enthusiastically held a "Pledge Loyalty to the Great Leader Chairman Mao" meeting. The workers expressed their determination to print more and better revolutionary books of Chairman Mao's works and to personally bring the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to Tsinghua University. They expressed with full fighting passion: We must hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and swear with the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of Tsinghua University to carry out the educational revolution well, turning Tsinghua University into a red Mao Zedong Thought university.

Now, the broad revolutionary masses who love the great leader Chairman Mao infinitely are preserving Chairman Mao's precious gift in the most appropriate way. They want their descendants to forever remember Chairman Mao's greatest concern, forever be infinitely loyal to the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and forever march forward under the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought!

The gift is precious, the affection is deep. Chairman Mao is with us, heart to heart. A thousand cheers and a million songs: Father and mother are not as dear as Chairman Mao.

　　巨大的关怀  殷切的期望
　　——首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队热烈欢呼伟大领袖毛主席赠送珍贵礼物
    一九六八年八月五日，清华园沸腾了，北京城沸腾了！
    在纪念毛主席《炮打司令部》的大字报和《中国共产党中央委员会关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》发表两周年的喜日里，我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖毛主席，向正在清华大学的首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队赠送了珍贵礼物芒果。
    这一特大喜讯，传到了清华园的各个角落，传到了首都工人阶级和广大工农兵群众的心坎上。喜讯传到那里，那里一片欢呼：
    “毛主席赠送珍贵礼物，是对我们的最大关怀，最大鼓舞，最大支持，最大鞭策！”
    “我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    “敬祝我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”
    在清华园，首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队的革命战士们，围着伟大领袖毛主席赠送的芒果，看了又看，闻了又闻。他们含着无限幸福的热泪，纷纷举行集会游行，向毛主席敬献忠心。很多人连夜写信和打电话，把这一特大喜讯传告给自己的战友和亲人。
    在首都街头上，热烈欢呼伟大领袖毛主席赠送珍贵礼物的大字标语不断出现。一队队革命职工、革命师生、解放军战士涌向清华园，向首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队热烈祝贺。还有不少人特意赶到中南海，向伟大领袖毛主席表示决心。
    在许多工厂里，革命职工们听到这一特大喜讯后，热烈欢呼，纵情歌唱。他们在庆祝会上，决心书里，纷纷向伟大领袖毛主席庄严宣誓，决心把毛主席的巨大关怀，变成鼓舞他们胜利前进的无穷无尽的精神力量。
    首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队的革命战士激动地说，我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，最关心我们工人阶级和广大工农兵群众，最支持我们的革命行动，毛主席永远和我们心连心。毛主席亲自发动和领导无产阶级文化大革命，依靠的是我们工人阶级和广大工农兵群众。在无产阶级教育革命中，毛主席也要我们工人阶级和广大工农兵群众，同革命师生员工一起冲锋陷阵。我们根据毛主席的伟大战略部署，组成毛泽东思想宣传队来到清华大学，同这个学校的革命红卫兵小将和革命师生员工共同落实毛主席的最新指示，刚刚做出了一点成绩，毛主席就向我们赠送珍贵礼物，这是他老人家对我们工人阶级和广大工农兵群众又一次巨大的支持，巨大的信任！伟大领袖毛主席给我们撑腰，我们一定要为毛主席争气！
    在喜得伟大领袖毛主席赠送的珍贵礼物的时候，北京第一轧钢厂的一些革命职工，回忆起一九六六年八月十日那个光辉的日子。就是在这个光辉的日子里，他们和首都广大革命群众一道，幸福地受到了伟大统帅毛主席的接见，亲耳听到了毛主席发出的伟大战斗号令：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”两年来，在毛主席这一伟大战斗号令的鼓舞下，他们和广大工农兵群众一起，在无产阶级文化大革命中充分发挥了主力军作用，取得了一个又一个胜利。如今，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大征途中，他们又参加了首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队，以无产阶级教育革命主力军的姿态出现在清华园。这些革命职工说，看着毛主席赠送的珍贵礼物，就好象毛主席站在我们身边，指挥我们进行战斗！
    伟大领袖毛主席赠送珍贵礼物的特大喜讯，在首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队的许多老工人中，激起了更为强烈的反响。他们被旧社会剥夺了上学读书的权利，他们对中国赫鲁晓夫长期维护资产阶级知识分子统治学校的局面早就非常不满。现在在经过了两年的无产阶级文化大革命以后，他们怀着无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席、无限忠于伟大的毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的深厚的无产阶级感情，昂首阔步迈进大学校园，和清华大学的革命师生员工一起宣传和落实毛主席的最新指示，要用自己的双手改变资产阶级知识分子统治学校的现象，进行无产阶级教育革命，这是多么光荣的政治任务啊！北京变压器厂革命委员会常委、工人代表徐德秀，在解放前全家八口人有五口人被夺去了生命，那时候，她一天学也没有上过。这位学习毛主席著作的积极分子参加首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队来到清华大学后，一直积极热情地宣传毛主席的最新指示。她看着毛主席赠送的芒果，激动得热泪盈眶，连连高呼：毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！她说：“毛主席给我们送来芒果，是对我们巨大的信任，殷切的期望！有伟大领袖毛主席给我们指路，我们一定能和清华大学的革命师生员工一起，迅速落实毛主席的最新指示，搞好教育革命，把清华大学办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校！”
    颗颗红心向着毛主席，朵朵葵花向着红太阳。经过两年来无产阶级文化大革命的锻炼、在毛主席光辉思想哺育下成长起来的首都工人阶级，永远忠于毛主席，紧紧围绕在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的周围。他们得知毛主席赠送芒果的特大喜讯，个个心情特别激动。
    北京针织总厂的革命职工眼望着毛主席送来的珍贵礼物，心潮澎湃喜泪流，千言万语涌心头。参加首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队和在厂的革命职工，都举行了隆重的庆祝大会，职工们说：毛主席呀，毛主席！是您派来的解放军遵循您的一贯教导，坚决执行支左工作三项原则，把您的光辉思想带给我们，使红太阳照亮了针织总厂。今天，您老人家又把最珍贵的礼物送给我们，鼓舞我们继续前进。回顾我们胜利的航程，每一步都是您老人家指引；总结我们胜利的经验，最根本的一条就是：紧密地团结在无产阶级司令部的周围，在无产阶级司令部的号令下统一意志，统一步伐，统一行动，坚定不移地落实您老人家的一系列最新指示。革命职工们表示，坚决批判反动的“多中心论”，更加忠于以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部。我们不仅要在本厂抓好革命，促好生产，而且要在参加首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队的工作中，学习解放军执行支左工作三项原则的经验，进行深入细致的、耐心的、持久的宣传工作，真正把毛泽东思想化为广大革命群众的实际行动，这是夺取教育革命彻底胜利的根本保证。
    北京新华印刷厂的革命职工在庆祝毛主席赠送珍贵礼物的喜日里，热烈举行了“向伟大领袖毛主席献红心”大会。职工们表示，一定要多印、印好革命宝书毛主席著作，一定要亲自把战无不胜的毛泽东思想带到清华园。他们满怀战斗激情地表示：一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，誓同清华大学的革命师生员工一起搞好教育革命，把清华园办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    现在，无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席的广大革命群众，正在用最妥善的方法，把毛主席赠送的珍贵礼物长期地保存下来。他们要让自己的子孙万代永远记住毛主席的最大关怀，永远对以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部无限忠诚，永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗奋勇前进！（附图片）
    礼物珍贵情意深，毛主席和我们心连心。千声欢呼万声唱：爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲。
    当北京新华印刷厂参加首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队的革命战士，手捧着伟大领袖毛主席赠送的珍贵礼物——芒果来到工厂时，革命职工满怀激情冒雨敬迎，热烈欢呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”　新华社记者摄
