In recent days, Beijing has been filled with joyous news, one after another, with victory songs echoing through the streets, drums beating, and firecrackers exploding. The red columns of joyous messengers are advancing.

In front of the reception hall at Zhongnanhai, the red bulletins are piling up higher and higher! Great leader Chairman Mao, the revolutionary people of the capital are reporting good news to you, and the revolutionary people of the entire nation are reporting good news to you through the waves of radio!

On August 15th, the editorials of the People's Daily and the Liberation Army Daily conveyed the latest instructions of our great leader Chairman Mao: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully bring into play the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in all work. The working class should also continuously raise its political consciousness in the struggle."

On the same day, you, Chairman Mao, received the representatives of the working class of the capital. Our sun, the reddest of the red, has left a radiant image in the hearts of the working class of the capital. They have focused their emotions on fully implementing your latest instructions!

The Working Class Is Forever Loyal to Chairman Mao

Great leader Chairman Mao! The working class declares to you: We will forever be loyal to you, forever loyal to your brilliant thoughts, and forever loyal to your revolutionary line!

Zhang Kui, the deputy director of the Revolutionary Committee of the Beijing First General Machinery Factory, a young worker who has made great contributions during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, as a representative of the capital's workers and peasants Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, stood on the stage, awaiting the happiest moment.

The stars in the sky forever point to the Big Dipper, and the red hearts of the working class forever point to the sun in our hearts, the reddest of the red. Chairman Mao, with a smiling face and radiant spirit, walked briskly to the stage where the worker representatives were standing and warmly shook hands with each of them.

When great leader Chairman Mao shook hands with Zhang Kui, his blood boiled, and tears streamed down his face. Zhang Kui drew boundless strength from the giant hands of Chairman Mao.

Zhang Kui returned to the factory, and his comrades lifted him up, eager to shake the hand that had been shaken by Chairman Mao. Everyone wanted to share this happiness, forming a long line, one by one, to shake his hand. In the midst of shaking hands, a thoughtful comrade asked, "Have you washed your hand?" Zhang Kui smiled and said, "I knew you all would want to shake this hand. This morning, when I washed my face, I specially used my left hand!" Zhang Kui's answer brought smiles to everyone's faces. The deep class feelings of being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao brought everyone's hearts even closer together.

Shi Guodong, a young worker from the Beijing First Machine Tool Factory, saw Chairman Mao and was so excited that he couldn't sleep all night. He couldn't wait to share his feelings with all his comrades, repeatedly saying, "Seeing our great leader Chairman Mao, my heart is so happy it wants to jump out. Chairman Mao receiving us is the greatest honor and greatest happiness for all the workers in our factory. I must be even more loyal to Chairman Mao, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions."

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! You care the most about the working class, and the working class is the most loyal to you. Shi Guodong is just one of the thousands and millions of workers who are loyal to you. You call for "revolutionizing and promoting production," and Shi Guodong listens to your words, overcoming all difficulties to move forward!

Shi Guodong's workshop is responsible for producing milling machine bore parts. The precision of the bores must not deviate by even one-third of a hair's width. In the past, producing these parts often required the repair workers to rework them, affecting the completion of the entire milling machine production task. At that time, some reactionary "technical authorities" said, "The machines for producing these parts are like this, and if you don't change the machines, the quality of the parts cannot be improved."

Shi Guodong heard this and felt that something was wrong. He opened his red copy of Chairman Mao's works and saw, "Weapons are an important factor in war, but not the decisive factor; the decisive factor is people, not things." His mind became clear. He thought, "Machines are operated by people. People armed with Mao Zedong Thought can make machines obey their commands." He decided to find a way to produce high-precision bores.

From then on, Shi Guodong carefully observed in production to master the laws of equipment changes. In the past, people would hand over the products they produced to the inspectors and then ignore them. But he would ask the inspectors about every product he produced, demanding to know exactly where it was unqualified. He recorded the inspectors' opinions, often studied them, and gradually improved his operating methods. Chairman Mao said, "In the world, the most feared thing is the word 'serious,' and the Communist Party values 'seriousness' the most." Because he studied seriously, he finally achieved the required precision of the products, greatly improving the quantity and quality of the entire milling machine production. In July of this year, he overfulfilled the state plan.

People say: Shi Guodong is a good worker who is loyal to Chairman Mao.

Continuously Raising Political Consciousness in Struggle

The great leader Chairman Mao's reception has become a great driving force for the working class of the capital to advance boldly on the road of ideological revolution.

"What should we do since Chairman Mao cares so much about us, the working class?" Everyone is seriously considering this question.

Zhang Xiaoding, deputy director of the Revolutionary Committee of the Beijing Chemical Factory, saw Chairman Mao and was so excited that he couldn't sleep all night. His thoughts surged, recalling how he had continuously raised his political consciousness in the struggle.

Zhang Xiaoding is an ordinary young forger. At the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he stood at the forefront of the movement and was the first to post a big-character poster criticizing the work team and the old party committee's implementation of the bourgeois reactionary line. Suddenly, labels like "counter-revolutionary" and "ambitious plotter" were thrown at him. Zhang Xiaoding thought: My father is a railway worker. Before liberation, he was an apprentice for the capitalists, living worse than animals, forcing me, a small child, to carry a basket to pick up rags and beg for food everywhere. After liberation, it was Chairman Mao who saved my family. It was Mao Zedong Thought that nurtured me into a person. Today, I am defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. If I am to change my stance, I will never agree. He repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "It is right to rebel against reactionaries" and "A thoroughgoing materialist is fearless." His mind became clear, and he was full of courage. At the meeting organized by the work team and the old party committee to attack him, Zhang Xiaoding engaged in a sharp struggle with them, striking a blow to the arrogance of a small handful of class enemies.

However, the factory's capitalist-roaders did not stop persecuting him and continued to organize big-character posters to attack him. He thought: As long as I firmly grasp Mao Zedong Thought, the revolution will definitely be victorious. He and everyone else raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, rebelled against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, and seized back the party, government, financial, and cultural powers they had usurped. Since then, the face of the chemical factory has been completely renewed.

Just in these days of victory, the class enemies did not give up their dying struggles and incited divisions within the revolutionary rebel factions. Soon, some comrades pulled out a few people to form another faction.

"Within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interests. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two hostile factions." The brilliance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions illuminated Zhang Xiaoding's heart. He organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, raising everyone's class consciousness, exposing a small handful of class enemies who incited divisions within the revolutionary ranks, and quickly achieving great unity in the revolution.

Zhang Xiaoding reviewed his process of growth over more than two years under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought and said with deep feelings, "In the future, I must listen to Chairman Mao's words, firmly implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary 'multi-center theory,' and continuously raise my ideological consciousness in class struggle to become a good worker who is forever loyal to Chairman Mao. I must, together with all the workers in the factory, advance continuously in the struggle!"

Xu Xiushan, a worker from the Beijing Third Textile Mill, returned to the factory facing the dawn. The image of Chairman Mao was deeply imprinted in his mind, and his excited heart had not yet calmed down.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Xu Xiushan and his revolutionary comrades followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, advancing step by step, and their thoughts also advanced step by step. Chairman Mao's reception this time gave him great encouragement. He decided to continuously raise his political consciousness in the struggle to repay Chairman Mao's care.

After arriving at the Mechanical Department, he heard that the water float in the water tank had broken. This water tank supplies water for the entire factory's production. If there is a problem, it will affect production and cause losses to the state. What should he do? He hesitated for a moment: "According to the usual situation, stop production and drain the water, or wait until the rest day to repair it!" No, he immediately rejected his own idea. This is the time to test myself in the struggle, and I must pass the test! So, he took the initiative to request the task and immediately started the repair.

After preparation, Xu Xiushan and two worker comrades jumped into the water to repair it. The battle was intense, pulling ropes, assembling pipes, up and down, busy all the time. The water was cold, and Xu Xiushan's body broke out in goosebumps, but his heart was warm. He and his comrades recited Chairman Mao's quotes together: "With firm determination, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory." They continued the battle and finally repaired the water float, ensuring the normal operation of the factory's production.

Playing a Leading Role in All Work

Chairman Mao teaches us, "The entire history of the revolution proves that without the leadership of the working class, the revolution will fail, and with the leadership of the working class, the revolution will succeed." The great practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution further proves Chairman Mao's unshakable truth. The working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, not only plays a leading role in politics but also in the field of science and technology. The working class is the main force in scaling the heights of science and technology.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! We are forever loyal to you, and we must play a leading role in all work. This is the oath made by the capital's worker representatives after seeing our great leader Chairman Mao. Huang Guisen, a worker representative from the Beijing Motorcycle Factory, was particularly excited. He thought of the old society, where they, the foundry workers, were called "black devils." It was the Communist Party and Chairman Mao who turned the "black devils" into the masters of the state. He loved the Communist Party and Chairman Mao from the bottom of his heart. He turned his infinite loyalty to Chairman Mao into the driving force for all his work. Not long ago, he and a few old workers together successfully experimented with the low-pressure casting of "crankcase" hard molds, which is a vivid example.

Since the establishment of the Beijing Motorcycle Factory, production has encountered a difficult problem, which is the casting of the crankcase. Using sand molds for production, the labor intensity is high, the work efficiency is low, and the quality is poor, with the scrap rate sometimes reaching 50%. The workers have long wanted to reform this, but the capitalist-roaders in the factory implemented the entire set of revisionist construction lines of the Chinese Khrushchev, completely looking down on the workers. They invited experts and engineers everywhere, copying foreign doctrines, and failed after more than two years.

In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the workers criticized the Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist line of "experts running the factory," breaking through the shackles and frameworks that bind the workers. Old workers Huang Guisen, Zhang Guifang, and others proposed to conduct low-pressure casting experiments with hard molds. This opinion was still opposed by some people, who said, "Even the engineers couldn't do it, can you do it?"

"We can do it!" The working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought is fearless. They repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "self-reliance" and decided to break the foreign frameworks and walk their own path.

There were indeed many difficulties! No drawings, what to do? Design and draw them yourself, make models yourself. No equipment, what to do? Modify old equipment yourself. They used the great fearlessness of the proletariat to overcome these difficulties.

In the scorching summer, they were not afraid of hardships, with sweat soaking their clothes, still working day and night by the 700-degree electric furnace. Failed, try again. When encountering difficulties, everyone sat down to read Chairman Mao's quotes, immediately full of confidence, full of energy, and continued to work.

After more than twenty experiments, the low-pressure casting of crankcase hard molds was finally successful. It improved the work efficiency by more than ten times compared to the previous sand mold casting, greatly saving manpower and materials, and significantly reducing the scrap rate.

One by one, the shiny crankcases were neatly arranged. They told people with facts: The wisdom and strength of the working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought are boundless. Old worker Huang Guisen said, "We will continue to improve and continuously overcome technical difficulties. We must achieve what foreigners have, and we must also have what foreigners do not have."

Look! In the process of transforming the "old master milling machine," how the working class played its role. Since 1952, the Beijing First Machine Tool Factory has been producing the No. 2 universal milling machine according to the entire set of design plans of the Soviet revisionists. This milling machine has many problems and is difficult to operate. The users are very dissatisfied and call it the "old master milling machine." The workers have long wanted to transform it, but a small handful of capitalist-roaders in the factory suppressed the workers' suggestions, saying, "Such an old, big, and difficult problem, even experts can't solve it, and workers can't solve it." In this way, for sixteen years, the "old master milling machine" has remained the same.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, revolutionary workers and revolutionary technical personnel, firmly following Chairman Mao's words, with the help of the stationed PLA, rose up to rebel against the capitalist-roaders and reactionary technical "authorities," and established the "Milling Machine Technical Revolution Group." After the group was established, they criticized the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line. The workers said, "We are Chairman Mao's workers and the masters of the factory. We not only want to be masters in politics but also in technology. We must send the 'old master milling machine' to the garbage heap of history."

In the process of transformation, transmission machines and casting machines for producing parts were needed. Everyone discussed, "Go to the market to buy!" Someone said, "Such machines can't be bought, what to do?" Finally, everyone unanimously said, "Even if we can buy them, we won't buy them, we'll do it ourselves!" They went to find leftover materials, waste materials, and scraps, and made the transmission machines and casting machines themselves.

With everyone's joint efforts, in just three months, the face of the "old master milling machine" was changed.

Turning Chairman Mao's Care into Revolutionary Strength

Chairman Mao instructs me to carry out his instructions, and Chairman Mao waves his hand for me to advance. The working class, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, does not relax for a moment in executing Chairman Mao's instructions and does not stop for a second in propagating Chairman Mao's instructions. Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! The working class implements your latest instructions item by item and fights day and night.

In the Beijing Stamp Factory, with the rhythm of the stamp rotary machine, one after another stamp with the radiant latest instructions of Chairman Mao is flowing out like water. This is a brand-new stamp designed and printed by the workers in an extremely short time: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully bring into play the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in all work. The working class should also continuously raise its political consciousness in the struggle." People enthusiastically look at the stamp with the radiant image of our great leader Chairman Mao, reading Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

Originally, the workers of this factory, after hearing Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the radio, immediately got out of bed and rushed to the workshop, gathering in groups of three or five to discuss: Chairman Mao is backing us up, and we must make Chairman Mao proud! We will immediately print Chairman Mao's latest instructions into stamps and give them to the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Thus, an intense battle began. However, there are no drawings for printing stamps, what to do? Asking an external unit to design takes time. Drawing it ourselves, we have never drawn before. Moreover, according to the previous revisionist "regulations," workers can only print according to the drawings and be "living tools," not design themselves. Who will control the fate of stamp design and printing? The workers' answer is firm: We, only we, the working class. Can we continue to let a small handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and bourgeois "authorities" control it, still using it to print tales of talented scholars and beauties, flowers, birds, and insects, creating public opinion for the restoration of capitalism? No! No! Since the working class has taken control of the factory's leadership, we must be good propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought and let Mao Zedong Thought occupy the propaganda front of stamps. Look, from the master craftsmen to the young workers, everyone has picked up the brush. Everyone thinks, finds ways, and offers suggestions, pooling their wisdom and strengths. After repeated discussions and revisions, a new stamp design by the workers came out.

Just at this time, a thrilling piece of good news came over the phone: Our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin received the representatives of the working class of the capital and the soldiers and officers of the PLA. Eleven representatives from the stamp factory saw our sun, the reddest of the red. Immediately, the entire factory was in jubilation, with surging emotions. The workers who had been fighting on the production line for a whole day forgot their fatigue, hunger, and time, and their energy was even more abundant, their work even more intense. They took photos while making plates, working together, more and more excited, not wanting to delay this glorious printing task by even a second in their hands, fighting until victory!

Xiao Ni, a worker representative from the Beijing Third Textile Mill, saw our great leader Chairman Mao, and her heart was restless for a long time. She couldn't sit still or sleep, so she turned on the light, opened her bag, and took out Chairman Mao's latest instructions to study. Chairman Mao's words were deeply imprinted in her heart. The more she studied, the more energetic she felt, the more determined she was: I must turn Chairman Mao's greatest care into the greatest strength. The next day, she got up especially early and started the machine with special vigor. Xiao Ni wrote in the shift handover book, passing on Chairman Mao's greatest care and Mao Zedong Thought to the next shift of comrades. She also wrote down her oath: "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! The workers who love you infinitely, our red hearts will never change!"

People saw the great power of Mao Zedong Thought in Xiao Ni and drew strength from her to advance. Li Chunli, who took over Xiao Ni's shift, saw the words Xiao Ni wrote in the shift handover book and was deeply moved. She decided to learn from Xiao Ni, to study, use, and propagate Mao Zedong Thought like her. That day, she checked the cleanliness under every machine especially carefully. Someone saw her checking so carefully and said to her, "Little Li, what's the harm in a little dirt?" Li Chunli said, "We must act according to Chairman Mao's teachings, being meticulous in everything, everywhere, and at all times. Although there is a little dirt, it hinders us from carrying out Chairman Mao's instructions of 'revolutionizing and promoting production,' and we must resolutely sweep it away!"

Li Chunli also wrote down passionate words when handing over the shift, passing on Mao Zedong Thought to the next shift of comrades. Our great leader Chairman Mao! We, the working class, must pass on your great thoughts shift by shift and turn your latest instructions into tremendous power!

Our beloved great leader Chairman Mao! Beijing is cheering, the nation is cheering, the world is cheering! Listen, the new march has risen by a few tones! The working class of the capital, the working class of the nation, the revolutionary people of the nation, must, under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, unify our understanding, unify our steps, and unify our actions to seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

The reporter of this newspaper

A thousand joys, ten thousand joys, Chairman Mao's reception is the greatest happiness of our lives! The revolutionary warriors of the capital's workers and peasants Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, who were received by Chairman Mao, with hearts full of excitement, shouted a thousand and ten thousand times: Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand long lives! Wish Chairman Mao eternal life! Ten thousand eternal lives! Photographed by Xinhua News Agency reporter

    工人阶级的盛大节日
    首都工人阶级热烈庆祝毛主席的最新指示发表，纵情欢呼毛主席的亲切接见
    连日来，北京城里，喜讯追着喜讯，凯歌连着凯歌，锣鼓喧天，鞭炮震地，报喜的红色纵队在前进。
    在中南海接待站前，封封红色喜报，不断在增高！伟大领袖毛主席啊！首都革命人民向您报喜，全国革命人民通过万里电波向您报喜！
      八月十五日，《人民日报》、《解放军报》社论传达了我们伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”就在同一天，您老人家又接见了首都工人阶级代表。我们心中最红最红的红太阳啊！首都工人阶级的心坎里，印下了您老人家的光辉形象。他们把感情的焦点，凝聚在全面落实您老人家的最新指示上！
          工人阶级永远忠于毛主席
    伟大的领袖毛主席啊！工人阶级向您表决心：我们永远忠于您，永远忠于您的光辉思想，永远忠于您的革命路线！
    北京第一通用机械厂革委会副主任张奎，这个在文化大革命中立下功勋的青年工人，作为首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队的代表，登上了主席台，等待着最幸福的时刻的到来。
    天上的群星永远朝北斗，我们工人阶级的颗颗红心啊，永远向着心中最红最红的红太阳。毛主席满面笑容，神采奕奕，健步走到主席台上的工人代表跟前，亲切地同他们一一握手。
    当伟大领袖毛主席同张奎握手时，他热血沸腾，热泪滚滚。张奎从毛主席这双巨手中，获得了无穷无尽的力量。
    张奎回到了厂里，同志们把他举了起来，争着握他那只被毛主席握过的手。大家为了分享这幸福，能握上他的手，排成一个长长的队伍，一个挨着一个地跟他握手。正在握手中间，有一个细心的同志问道：“你的手洗过吗？”张奎笑着说：“我早就想到了你们要握这只手。今天早起洗脸时，我特意用左手洗的哪！”张奎的回答，引起大家会心的微笑。无限忠于毛主席的深厚阶级感情，把大家的心更紧密地连在一起了。
    北京第一机床厂青年工人石国栋，见到了毛主席，兴奋得通夜没有睡着觉，他恨不得把自己的心情告诉所有的同志，他一遍一遍地说：“看到我们伟大的领袖毛主席，我的心高兴得几乎要跳出来了。毛主席接见我们，这是我们全厂职工最大的光荣，最大的幸福。我一定要更加忠于毛主席，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。”
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您最关心工人阶级，工人阶级最忠于您。石国栋就是千千万万忠于您的工人中的一个。您号召“抓革命，促生产”，石国栋就听您的话，克服重重困难向前进！
    石国栋所在的加工车间，担负着生产铣床镗孔零件的任务。镗孔精密度要求不能相差一根头发丝的三分之一。过去生产这些零件，常常要靠修理工重新加工，影响了整个铣床生产任务的完成。当时有些反动技术“权威”说：“生产这些零件的机器就是那个样子，不改换机器，零件质量提高不了。”
    石国栋听了，觉得这话很不对头。他打开红彤彤的毛主席著作，看到“武器是战争的重要的因素，但不是决定的因素，决定的因素是人不是物”，思想豁然开朗起来。他想：“机器是靠人操作的。用毛泽东思想武装起来的人掌握了机器，机器就能乖乖地听人使唤。”他下决心找出生产精密度很高的镗孔的窍门。
    从此以后，石国栋在生产中细心观察，去掌握设备变化的规律。过去人们把生产出来的产品，交给检验员以后，就不管了。而他生产每一个产品，都要向检验员问个水落石出，究竟那些地方不合格。他把检验员的意见记下来，经常研究，逐步改进操作方法。毛主席说：“世界上怕就怕‘认真’二字，共产党就最讲‘认真’。”由于他认真钻研，最后终于使产品的精密度达到了要求，使整个铣床的生产数量和质量大大提高，今年七月份超额完成了国家计划。
    人们说：石国栋是忠于毛主席的好工人。
        在斗争中不断提高政治觉悟
    伟大领袖毛主席的接见，成了激励首都工人阶级在思想革命化大道上阔步前进的巨大动力。
      “毛主席他老人家这样关心我们工人阶级，我们应该怎么办？”大家都在认真地思考这个问题。
    北京化工厂革委会副主任张小钉见到毛主席，激动得一夜也没睡着。他思潮澎湃，回忆着自己是怎样在斗争中不断提高政治觉悟的。
    张小钉，是个普普通通的青年锻工。无产阶级文化大革命一开始，他就站在运动的前列，第一个贴出了炮轰工作组和旧党委所推行的资产阶级反动路线的大字报。霎时，“反革命”、“野心家”的帽子向他飞来。张小钉想：我父亲是铁路工人，解放前，给资本家当学徒，生活不如牛马，逼得我小小年纪就提着筐子拣破烂，四处乞讨。解放了，是毛主席救了我一家。又是毛泽东思想把我哺育成人。今天，我保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，要我改变自己的立场，万万办不到。他反复学习毛主席“对反动派造反有理”和“彻底的唯物主义者是无所畏惧的”教导，心明眼亮，浑身是胆。在工作组和旧党委组织的围攻他的大会上，张小钉和他们展开了针锋相对的斗争，打击了一小撮阶级敌人的嚣张气焰。
    但是，厂里走资派并没有停止对他的迫害，继续组织大字报围攻他。他想：只要自己紧紧地掌握毛泽东思想，革命就一定胜利。他和大家一起，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，造党内一小撮走资派的反，夺回了他们窃踞的党政财文大权。从此，化工厂里的面貌焕然一新。
    就在这胜利的日子里，阶级敌人并不甘心他们的死亡，进行垂死的挣扎。他们煽动革命造反派内部分裂。不久，一些同志又拉出少数人另立了一个山头。
      “在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”毛主席这一最新指示的光辉，照耀着张小钉的心房。他就组织大家学习毛主席最新指示，提高了大家的阶级觉悟，揪出了一小撮煽动分裂革命队伍的阶级敌人，很快实现了革命的大联合。
    张小钉回顾了两年多来自己在毛泽东思想哺育下不断成长的过程，深有体会地说：“我今后一定要好好听毛主席的话，坚定不移地落实毛主席一系列最新指示，彻底批判资产阶级反动的‘多中心论’，在阶级斗争中不断提高自己的思想觉悟，做一个永远忠于毛主席的好工人。我一定要同全厂工人同志一道，在斗争中不断前进！”
    北京第三棉纺织厂工人许秀山迎着朝霞，回到了工厂。毛主席的光辉形象，深深印在他的脑子里，他激动的心情还没有平静下来。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，许秀山和革命同志一道，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，一步步前进，思想也一步步提高。毛主席这次接见，又给他极大鼓舞。他决心在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟，来报答毛主席的关怀。
    到了机动科后，他听说蓄水池里的水漂坏了。这个蓄水池供应全厂生产用水，如果发生问题，就要影响生产，给国家带来损失。怎么办呢？他迟疑了一下：“按照平常的情况，停产把水抽干，或者等到休息日再修吧！”不行，他立刻就否定了自己的想法。这正是在斗争中考验自己的时候，我得经受考验啊！于是，他就主动请求任务，立即着手修理。
    经过准备以后，许秀山和两位工人同志一道，跳下水抢修。战斗是紧张的，接绳子，整套管，上上下下，忙个不停。水很凉，许秀山身上起了鸡皮疙瘩，但他心里却是热乎乎的。他和同志们一道背诵着毛主席语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”他们坚持战斗下去，终于修好了水漂，保证了厂里生产的正常进行。
        在一切工作中发挥领导作用
    毛主席教导我们说：“整个革命历史证明，没有工人阶级的领导，革命就要失败，有了工人阶级的领导，革命就胜利了。”无产阶级文化大革命的伟大实践，更加证明了毛主席这一颠扑不破的真理。用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，不仅在政治上起领导作用，在科学技术领域里也起领导作用。工人阶级是攀登科学技术高峰的主力军。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！我们永远忠于您，我们一定要在一切工作中发挥领导作用。这是首都的工人代表见到伟大领袖毛主席后立下的誓言。北京摩托车厂的工人代表黄桂森心情特别激动。他想起旧社会，他们铸工被人骂为“黑鬼子”。是共产党和毛主席使“黑鬼子”变成了国家的主人。他打心眼里热爱共产党，热爱毛主席。他把对毛主席的无限忠心变为一切工作的动力。不久前，他和几个老工人一起，试验成功“曲轴箱”硬模低压铸造，就是一个生动的事例。
    北京摩托车厂自建厂以来，生产中遇到一个难题，就是铸造曲轴箱。用砂模制造，劳动强度大，工作效率低，质量又差，废品率有时达到百分之五十。工人们很早就要进行改革，可是厂内走资派推行中国赫鲁晓夫的一整套修正主义建厂路线，根本瞧不起工人。他们到处请专家、工程师，照搬洋教条，搞了二年多，都失败了。
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，工人批判了中国赫鲁晓夫“专家办厂”的修正主义路线，冲破了束缚工人的条条和框框。老工人黄桂森、张贵芳等提出了要进行硬模低压铸造的试验。这个意见，依然遭到了一些人的反对，他们说：“工程师都没搞出来，你们搞得出来吗？”
      “搞得出来！”用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级是无畏的。他们反复学习了毛主席关于“自力更生”的教导后，决定打破洋框框，走自己的路。
    困难真不少！没有图纸，怎么办？自己设计，自己绘图，自己做模型。没有设备怎么办？自己用旧设备改装。他们用无产阶级的大无畏的气概战胜这些困难。
    在酷热的暑天里，他们不怕艰苦，汗水湿透了衣裳，依然不分昼夜地战斗在七百多度的电炉旁。失败了，再来。遇到困难时，大家坐下来读毛主席语录，立即信心百倍，浑身是劲，继续干下去。
    经过二十几次的试验，曲轴箱硬模低压铸造终于试验成功了。它比过去砂模铸造，提高工作效率十几倍，大大地节省了人力和原材料，废品率大大降低了。
    一个个银光闪闪的曲轴箱整齐地排列着。它们用事实告诉人们：用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级的智慧和力量是无穷的。老工人黄桂森说：“我们还要不断改进，不断地攻克技术难关。我们一定要做到外国人有的，我们也有；外国人没有的，我们也要有。”
    看吧！在改造“老爷铣床”当中，工人阶级又是怎样发挥他们的作用的。北京第一机床厂从一九五二年起，就按照苏修的一整套设计方案，生产二号万能铣床。这种铣床毛病很多，不好操作。使用单位很不满意，称它是“老爷铣床”。工人早就想改造它，可是，厂里一小撮走资派扼杀工人建议，说什么：“这么老、大、难的问题，专家都不好解决，工人解决不了。”就这样，十六年来，“老爷铣床”一直还是那个老样子。
    在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，革命的工人和革命的技术人员，坚决听毛主席的话，在驻厂解放军帮助下，起来造了走资派和反动技术“权威”的反，成立了“铣床技术革命小组”。小组成立以后，批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线。工人说：“我们是毛主席的工人，是工厂的主人。我们不仅在政治上要当家做主，在技术上也要当家做主。我们一定要把‘老爷铣床’送进历史的垃圾堆”。
    在改造过程中，需要生产零件的传线机和加铸机。大家议论开了：“到市场上去买吧！”有人说：“这种机器买不到，怎么办？”最后，大家一致说：“买得到我们也不买，自己动手干！”他们分头去寻找下脚料、余料、废料，自己动手制成了传线机和加铸机。
    在大家的共同努力下，只用了短短的三个月时间，就改变了“老爷铣床”的面貌。
      把毛主席的关怀化为革命的力量
    毛主席指示我照办，毛主席挥手我前进。经过文化大革命洗礼的工人阶级，对执行毛主席的指示，一时一刻不放松，对宣传毛主席的指示，一分一秒不停息。毛主席啊，毛主席！工人阶级对您的最新指示，条条落实，日夜奋战。
    在北京邮票厂里，随着邮票轮转机转动的节拍，一张张印有光芒四射的毛主席最新指示的邮票，流水般涌了出来。这是一张由工人自己在极短时间内设计印刷出来的崭新邮票：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”人们热情地望着邮票上满面笑容的伟大领袖毛主席像，读着毛主席的最新指示。
    原来这个厂的工人，从广播里听到毛主席的这一最新指示，立即翻身下床，跑到车间，三五成群议论开来：毛主席为我们撑腰，我们要为毛主席争气！我们立刻把毛主席的最新指示印制成邮票，交给广大工农兵。
    于是，一场紧张的战斗开始了。但是，印制邮票没有图稿怎么办？请外单位设计，时间来不及。自己画吧，从来没有画过。而且按照过去修正主义的“规定”，工人只能按图印刷，当“活工具”，不能自己设计。到底谁来掌握邮票设计印制的命运？工人们的回答是坚定的：我们，只有我们工人阶级。难道能继续让党内一小撮走资派和资产阶级“权威”控制，仍然用来印刷才子佳人，花鸟虫鱼，为复辟资本主义制造舆论？不能！不能！我们工人阶级既然掌握了工厂的领导大权，我们就要当好一名毛泽东思想的宣传员，让毛泽东思想去占领邮票的宣传阵地。你看，从老师傅到青年工人，都拿起画笔来了。人人动脑筋，想办法，出主意，群策群力，集思广益。经过反复讨论、修改，一张由工人设计的新式的邮票图案出来了。
    正在这时，从电话里传来了一个振奋人心的特大喜讯：伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席接见了首都工人阶级代表和解放军指战员，邮票厂十一名代表见到了我们心中最红最红的红太阳。顿时，全厂欢腾，心潮澎湃。站在生产岗位上整整战斗了一天的工人同志，忘掉疲劳，忘记饥饿，忘了时间，精力更加充沛，工作更加紧张。他们边照相，边制版，同心协力，越干越欢，谁也不愿意使这一光荣的印制任务在自己手里耽误一秒钟，一直战斗到胜利！
    北京市第三棉纺织厂工人代表倪庆华，看到我们伟大领袖毛主席，她心头久久不能平静。她坐不住，睡不着，干脆拧亮了灯，打开了背包，拿出毛主席的最新指示来学习。毛主席的话，字字印在她的心坎上。她越学心里越有劲，越学心里越坚定：我要把毛主席的最大关怀化为最大的力量。第二天，她起得特别早，开起机器来特别有劲。倪庆华在交接班簿上把毛主席的最大关怀，把毛泽东思想传给下一班同志。她还写下了自己的誓言：“毛主席啊，毛主席！无限热爱您的工人，颗颗红心永不变！”
    人们从小倪的身上看到了毛泽东思想的无比威力，从她身上汲取了前进的力量。接替小倪的班的李春莉，看到倪庆华写在交接簿上的话，十分感动。她决心向倪庆华学习，象她那样把毛泽东思想学好，用好，宣传好。这一天她特别认真检查每部机器底下的清洁卫生。有人看她检查得那么认真，就对她说：“小李，有一点脏东西碍啥？”李春莉说：“我们要按照毛主席的教导办事，时时、处处、事事做到一丝不苟。虽然有一点脏，但它妨碍我们去执行毛主席‘抓革命，促生产’的指示，我们就要坚决扫掉它！”
    李春莉在交班的时候，也写下了热情洋溢的话，把毛泽东思想传给下一班的同志。我们伟大的领袖毛主席啊！我们工人阶级一定要把您的伟大思想一班又一班地传下去，把您的最新指示化为巨大的动力！
                ×　×　×
    我们敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席啊！北京城在欢呼，全国在欢呼，全世界在欢呼！听吧，新的进行曲又提高了几个音阶！首都工人阶级，全国工人阶级，全国革命人民，一定要在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的领导下，统一认识，统一步伐，统一行动，去夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
