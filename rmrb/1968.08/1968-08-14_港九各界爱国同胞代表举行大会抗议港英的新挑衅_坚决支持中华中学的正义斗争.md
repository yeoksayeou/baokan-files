More than 300 representatives of various circles in Hong Kong and Kowloon held a rally on August 12 to firmly support the struggle of the Chinese Middle School against the persecution by the British authorities. They demanded that the British authorities immediately stop their new persecution of the Chinese Middle School. Otherwise, they will reap what they sow.

The representatives of various circles who attended the rally were united in their indignation and anger, strongly protesting against the new provocations by the British authorities against the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong. The chairman of the rally pointed out: Since last May, the evil British imperialists have not stopped persecuting our patriotic compatriots. Recently, at a time when our anti-British and anti-violence struggle is going well and Mao Zedong Thought is increasingly penetrating people's hearts, the British authorities have again extended their claws into the patriotic education cause, brazenly declaring that they will revoke the registration of the Chinese Middle School. This is a completely unreasonable and fascist act. The widespread dissemination of Mao Zedong Thought and the development of patriotic education are not something that a handful of British imperialists can stop. The British authorities' plot to revoke the registration will absolutely not intimidate the brave teachers and students of the Chinese Middle School. On the contrary, it will only further arouse the resistance of the broad masses of workers, students, and patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, and will only meet with the resolute counterattack of the patriotic compatriots!

The representative of the Chinese Middle School reported at the meeting on how the entire school's teachers and students, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have been fighting against the enemy in a head-on struggle. They expressed their confidence that they will definitely repel the enemy's arrogant attack. Representatives from various industries, students, the business community, the press, and the film industry all spoke at the meeting. They unanimously expressed their full support for the just struggle of the Chinese Middle School. They pointed out: The struggle of the Chinese Middle School is our struggle. We will not tolerate the barbaric persecution by the British authorities. If the British authorities do not immediately stop their persecution, the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, know how to deal with them.

In the past twenty days, the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong have been protesting against the British authorities' persecution of the Chinese Middle School with waves of anger. More than ten thousand patriotic compatriots from various circles have participated in condolence and accusation meetings. Many patriotic compatriots have also distributed leaflets, posted slogans, published small newspapers, and performed street art performances to firmly support the just struggle of the Chinese Middle School. The broad masses of workers, students' parents, alumni, residents, and employees of patriotic organizations have also donated the great leader Chairman Mao's revolutionary books, Mao's portraits, and Mao badges, as well as banners, letters of condolence, etc., to the teachers and staff of the Chinese Middle School, greatly encouraging the teachers and staff and enhancing their confidence in victory. They expressed their determination to stand together with the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, under the support of the great socialist motherland, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, to brave the storm and fight the waves, and to struggle to the end with the enemy.

　　港九各界爱国同胞代表举行大会抗议港英的新挑衅
　　坚决支持中华中学的正义斗争
    新华社香港十三日电　港九各界爱国同胞代表三百多人十二日举行大会，坚决支持中华中学反对港英当局迫害的斗争，责令港英当局立即停止对中华中学的新迫害。否则，必将自食其果。
    参加大会的各界爱国同胞代表个个同仇敌忾，愤怒抗议港英当局对香港爱国同胞的新挑衅。大会主席在讲话中指出：自去年五月以来，万恶的港英帝国主义对我爱国同胞的迫害一直没有停止过。最近，正当我反英抗暴斗争的形势一片大好，毛泽东思想日益深入人心的时候，港英当局又把它的魔爪伸进爱国教育事业，悍然宣称要撤销中华中学的注册。这完全是蛮横无理的法西斯的行径。毛泽东思想的大传播，爱国教育事业的大发展，绝不是一小撮港英帝国主义分子所阻遏得了的。港英当局撤销注册的阴谋绝对吓不倒英勇的中华中学师生们，相反，只会更加激起港九广大工人、师生和爱国同胞的反抗，只能得到爱国同胞的坚决回击！
    中华中学代表在会上报告了他们全校师生用毛泽东思想武装起来，同敌人进行针锋相对斗争的经过，信心百倍地表示，一定要打退敌人的猖狂进攻。各业工人、学生、工商界、新闻界和电影界的代表，都在会上讲了话。他们一致表示要全力支持中华中学的正义斗争。他们指出：中华中学的斗争就是我们的斗争，我们决不容忍港英当局的野蛮迫害。如果港英当局不立即停止迫害，用毛泽东思想武装起来的香港爱国同胞是懂得怎样对付它的。
    近二十多天来，香港爱国同胞抗议港英当局迫害中华中学的怒涛一浪高一浪，一万多名各界爱国同胞先后参加了慰问和控诉大会，许多爱国同胞还撒传单，贴标语，出版小型报，进行街头文艺演出，坚决支持中华中学的正义斗争。广大工人、学生家长、校友、居民、爱国机构职工等还把伟大领袖毛主席的革命宝书、毛主席像和毛主席像章，以及锦旗、慰问信等赠送给中华中学的师生员工，使这个学校的师生员工受到极大鼓舞，增强了必胜的信心。他们表示，誓同港九爱国同胞一起，在伟大的社会主义祖国支持下，在毛泽东思想的指引下，顶狂风战恶浪，同敌人斗争到底。
