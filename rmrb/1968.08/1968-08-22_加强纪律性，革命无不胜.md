Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must strengthen discipline education throughout the Party, because unity in discipline is a necessary condition for revolutionary victory." At crucial moments in the great victory of the Chinese revolution, Chairman Mao always called on the revolutionary army to strengthen the proletarian collective consciousness and revolutionary organizational discipline. This is to ensure the leadership of Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters, enhance the unity of the revolutionary ranks, raise combat effectiveness, and overcome the class enemy to achieve revolutionary victory, which is a necessary condition.

In the mind of the Chinese Khrushchev, there is no concept of the whole, and there is no proletarian organizational discipline. The anarchist evil wind of "doubt everything, overthrow everything" that he stirred up is an attempt to deny the revolutionary authority of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, to deny the revolutionary discipline established by the proletariat on the basis of high consciousness, and to sabotage the proletarian dictatorship. This heinous crime of the Chinese Khrushchev must be exposed, criticized, and its poisonous influence must be eliminated.

The instructions of Chairman Mao and every battle order of the proletarian headquarters concentrate on representing the fundamental interests of the proletariat and the broad masses of the people. Countless facts prove that only by strictly implementing Chairman Mao's various instructions and the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters can we unite millions of revolutionary troops like one person to overcome all difficulties and defeat any enemy. We proletarian revolutionary soldiers deeply understand that our people's army is personally founded by Chairman Mao and armed with Mao Zedong Thought. We must have a high sense of revolutionary discipline. At any time and under any circumstances, we must regard Mao Zedong Thought as the highest command and execute it resolutely and thoroughly. Following Chairman Mao's words and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions is the highest discipline and the highest standard of action for us revolutionary soldiers.

"Strengthen discipline, revolution knows no defeat." Our unit responds to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness." For many years, we have cooperated with brother units in construction, distributed over several large and medium-sized bridges, culverts, tunnels, and more than ten construction sites, spaced seven or eight miles apart. We implement a five-shift, four-shift rotation system in the unit. In the face of fewer cadres and frequent personnel changes, we rely on Mao Zedong Thought to tightly bind the hearts of every comrade in the unit. Whether on duty or off duty, whether dispersed or concentrated, they not only

make a single squad or platoon dispersed and firm, but also make a single person dispersed and consciously abide by organizational discipline. They achieve unity in dispersion, dispersion in unity, and when gathered, they form a fist; when scattered, they become a spear. This demonstrates the revolutionary soldiers' boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao. The comrades in the electrician class are distributed in six construction sites for cooperative construction. In the face of heavy tasks and reduced personnel, they all consciously regard Chairman Mao's words as the highest command to guide all their actions and model the revolutionary discipline of the proletariat. In summer, they work in high-temperature power distribution rooms; in winter, they climb poles and lay lines in heavy snow; on weekends and holidays, they voluntarily sacrifice their rest time to inspect and maintain lines. During tunnel construction, after blasting, they are the first to enter the thick smoke to install lights; after detonation, they are responsible for removing the lights and are the last to leave. Whether it is windy and rainy or scorching hot; whether it is day or night, they go wherever needed and resolutely obey orders. They would rather give up everything personal than give up the revolutionary discipline of the proletariat; they would rather endure the greatest hardship themselves than let the construction be affected in the slightest. The entire unit has completed the mechanical construction tasks excellently year after year. Living facts tell us that strengthening revolutionary organizational discipline is an important guarantee for us to overcome all difficulties and complete various tasks. Comrades deeply feel: "The farther we are from the leadership, the more we must consciously abide by revolutionary discipline; the more dispersed we are, the more we must use Mao Zedong Thought to unify our thoughts and actions."

The Chinese Khrushchev attempts to lead us astray with the reactionary tide of anarchism, to make us deviate from Chairman Mao's unified strategic deployment, and not abide by the revolutionary discipline of the proletariat, in order to achieve his evil goal of sabotaging the proletarian dictatorship and burying the proletarian revolutionary cause. This is absolutely impossible. We revolutionary soldiers firmly remember the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings on strengthening revolutionary organizational discipline. Not only must we consciously abide by the revolutionary discipline of the proletariat, but we should also bravely fight to maintain revolutionary discipline. For the extremely few individuals in society who disrupt Chairman Mao's strategic deployment and insist on the "multi-center is no center" theory, we must wage a resolute struggle against them. Let the entire Party, the entire army, and the people of the whole country firmly and unconditionally execute every instruction and every order of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, and forever advance along the course indicated by Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters to victory.

    加强纪律性，革命无不胜
    解放军某部指导员　吴庆章
    毛主席教导说：“要在全党加强纪律教育，因为统一纪律，是革命胜利的必要条件。”毛主席在中国革命夺取伟大胜利的关键时刻，总是号召革命大军加强无产阶级整体观念，加强革命的组织纪律性，这是保证毛主席的无产阶级司令部的领导，增强革命队伍的团结，提高战斗力，以战胜阶级敌人取得革命胜利的必要条件。
    中国赫鲁晓夫心目中根本没有整体观念，根本没有无产阶级的组织纪律。他刮起的“怀疑一切，打倒一切”的无政府主义的妖风，就是妄图否定以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的革命权威，否定无产阶级建立在高度自觉基础上的革命纪律，破坏无产阶级专政。对于中国赫鲁晓夫这一滔天罪行，必须揭露，必须批判，肃清其流毒。
    毛主席的指示，无产阶级司令部的每一个战斗号令，都集中地代表了无产阶级和广大人民群众的根本利益。无数事实证明，只有不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席的各项指示和毛主席的无产阶级司令部的战斗号令，才能把千百万浩浩荡荡的革命大军团结得象一个人一样，去克服一切困难，战胜任何敌人。我们无产阶级革命战士深深懂得，我们人民军队是毛主席亲自缔造的，是用毛泽东思想武装起来的，要有高度的革命纪律性，不论在任何时候、任何情况下，都要把毛泽东思想当作最高的命令，坚决执行，彻底照办。听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，就是我们革命战士的最高纪律和行动的最高准则。
      “加强纪律性，革命无不胜”。我们部队响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”的伟大号召，长年配合兄弟连队施工，分布在相距七、八里路的大、中桥，涵洞，隧道等十几个工点，在连队实行五班制四班倒施工作业。在干部少、人员调动频繁的情况下，我们靠毛泽东思想把全连每个同志的心紧紧地连在一起，干部战士外出和在连队一样，分散和集中一样，他们不仅
  一个班、一个排分散出去过得硬，一个人单独在外也能自觉地遵守组织纪律，做到人散心不散，人散心更齐，捏起来成拳头，撒出去象尖刀，表现了革命战士对毛主席的无限忠诚。电工班的同志们分布在六个工点配合施工，在任务重、人员减少的情况下，他们都自觉地把毛主席的话当作指挥自己一切行动的最高命令，模范地遵守无产阶级革命纪律。夏天，配电所温度高，他们坚持工作；冬天，风雪大，他们也坚持爬杆架线；星期天和节日，他们主动牺牲休息时间，检查维修线路。隧道施工中，放炮后他们第一个冒着浓烟去安电灯；点炮后他们负责撤出电灯，最后一个出来。无论是刮风下雨，还是烈日炎炎；无论是白天、还是黑夜，那里需要就到那里去，坚决服从命令。他们宁愿丢掉个人的一切，也不丢掉无产阶级的革命纪律；宁愿自己吃最大的苦，也不让施工受到丝毫影响，全连年年出色地完成了机械施工任务。活生生的事实告诉我们，加强革命的组织纪律性，是我们战胜一切困难、完成各项任务的重要保证。同志们深有感受地说：“我们越是远离领导，就越要自觉地遵守革命纪律；越是高度分散，就越要用毛泽东思想来统一我们的思想和行动。”
    中国赫鲁晓夫妄图用无政府主义的反动思潮，把我们引入歧途，要我们离开毛主席的统一战略部署，不遵守无产阶级的革命纪律，达到他破坏无产阶级专政，葬送无产阶级革命事业的罪恶目的，这是绝对办不到的。我们革命战士牢牢记住伟大领袖毛主席关于加强革命的组织纪律性的教导，不但要自觉地遵守无产阶级的革命纪律，还应该勇敢地为维护革命纪律而斗争。对于社会上极少数干扰毛主席战略部署和坚持搞“多中心即无中心论”的人，我们要同他们作坚决的斗争，使全党全军全国人民坚定不移地、不折不扣地执行以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的每一条指示，每一个号令，永远沿着毛主席的无产阶级司令部指引的航道胜利前进。
