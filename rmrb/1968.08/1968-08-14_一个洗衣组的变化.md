A laundry group at the Central Hospital of the Shandong New Wencheng Mining Bureau, under the influence of the revisionist line of running the hospital, increased from a few people to twenty-five over a few years. Moreover, it had complete departments for receiving, accounting, and more, with a severe phenomenon of excessive personnel.

Five years ago, the hospital spent over 4,000 yuan to buy a washing machine, but the capitalist-roaders always found excuses not to install or use it, insisting on increasing the number of laundry personnel. The broad masses of the hospital had strong opinions about the excessive personnel in the laundry group, but the problem remained unsolved.

After the revolutionary committee of the hospital was established this March, following Chairman Mao's latest instructions on building revolutionary committees, the issue of streamlining the laundry group was also brought to the agenda. The hospital revolutionary committee and military representatives first mobilized the broad masses of the laundry group to engage in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism. While exposing the bad elements who sabotaged the movement, they repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "streamlining and downsizing," "politics is the commander," "politics is the soul," "thrift makes revolution," and other series of teachings. They fiercely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line that China's Khrushchev promoted in the construction of political power.

Based on the great criticism, the laundry group quickly implemented streamlining and downsizing, reducing from the original twenty-five people to four. The electricians and boiler room workers overcame various difficulties and installed the washing machine that had been dormant for five years, fully utilizing its functions.

Now, these four people, in addition to taking on their original washing tasks, also handle the sewing and mending of public items for the entire hospital, and have improved the washing quality. Originally, the laundry room overspent by over 500 yuan each month, but now, not only is there no overspending, but they can also save over 300 yuan each month. After more than two months of practice, the masses reflect that streamlining and downsizing is indeed good!

　　一个洗衣组的变化
    山东新汶矿务局中心医院洗衣组，过去在修正主义办院路线的影响下，几年内，由几个人增加到二十五个人，而且收发、会计样样俱全，人浮于事的现象十分严重。
    五年前，这个医院曾经花了四千多元，买了一部洗衣机，可是，走资派总是以种种借口，一直不安装，不使用，拚命增加洗衣人员。医院广大群众对洗衣组人浮于事，意见很大，但问题一直得不到解决。
    今年三月，医院革委会诞生以后，根据毛主席关于建设革委会的最新指示，洗衣组的精兵简政问题，也被提到日程上来。院革委会和军代表首先发动洗衣组的广大群众斗私批修，在揪出破坏运动的坏人的同时，反复学习了毛主席关于“精兵简政”、政治是统帅，是灵魂、“节约闹革命”等一系列的教导，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面推行的反革命修正主义路线。
    在大批判的基础上，洗衣组很快就实行了精兵简政，由原来的二十五人，减少到了四个人。电工组和锅炉房的几个工人同志，克服了各种困难，把沉睡了五年的洗衣机安装起来，充分发挥了它的作用。
    现在，这四个人除了担负原来的洗涤任务外，还兼做全院公物的缝纫、缀补工作，而且提高了洗涤质量。原来洗衣房每月超支五百多元，现在，不但不超支，每月还可以节约三百多元。经过两个多月的实践，群众反映，精兵简政就是好！
