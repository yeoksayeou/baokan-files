	Boumedienne Emphasizes Military Solution to the Israeli Problem
	Algeria's National Revolutionary Council Chairman Boumedienne recently told a reporter from the United Arab Republic's *Al-Jumhuriya* that the Arab people should not consider the possibility of a so-called "peaceful solution" to the Middle East problem, "because our experience with Israel is bitter. Apart from the glorious military solution, we should not accept any other solution."

	He emphasized: "The Middle East problem is not the responsibility of a single Arab country, but the responsibility and problem of the entire Arab nation."

	Boumedienne spoke about the role of the Palestinian people in this anti-aggression armed struggle. He said: "Every Arab must participate in this struggle. We should not be afraid of the protracted nature of the battle."
