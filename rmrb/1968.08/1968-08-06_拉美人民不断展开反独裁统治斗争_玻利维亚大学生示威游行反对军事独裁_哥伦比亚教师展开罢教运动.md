Latin American peoples are continuously waging struggles against dictatorial rule. Bolivian students hold protests against military dictatorship, and Colombian teachers launch a strike.

	New China News Agency, August 4th: The people of some Latin American countries are continuously fighting against the reactionary measures of their ruling authorities, which include selling out national interests, intensifying the exploitation of laborers, and suppressing the masses.

	On the evening of the 2nd, hundreds of students and workers in Cochabamba, a central agricultural hub in Bolivia, held a demonstration to protest the recent agreement signed by the pro-American military dictatorship with the American-owned Gulf Oil Company, which sells out the country's oil resources. The reactionary authorities dispatched military police, using rifles, tear gas, and police dogs to disperse the demonstrators. The protesters engaged in fierce struggles with the military police, detaining one police officer and one government official, and occupying a local university.

	This demonstration took place while the Bolivian president was inspecting the agricultural center of Ucurena near Cochabamba, and the authorities had declared a ban on demonstrations and imposed martial law. During the demonstration, two students were killed, ten were injured, and over a hundred were arrested. The protesters were outraged by the authorities' brutal suppression and demanded the immediate release of the detained and the resignation of the governor of Cochabamba province.

	On July 31st, nearly a thousand students in La Paz, the capital of Bolivia, also held a demonstration against military dictatorship. The demonstrators shouted slogans such as "Down with military rule" and others opposing the Barrientos dictatorship.

	In Colombia, due to the intensifying plunder by American imperialism and the worsening economy, the ruling authorities have repeatedly delayed the payment of teachers' salaries. Recently, public school teachers in Colombia launched a large-scale strike. Starting in mid-July, the strike for the payment of overdue salaries, which began in Santander province, quickly spread across the country. Teachers in provinces such as Cundinamarca, Choco, La Guajira, Atlántico, Magdalena, Tolima, and Meta participated in the strike, with over 26,000 teachers joining. The teachers' struggle received widespread support from workers and other sectors of the people.

	In Uruguay, after a 24-hour general strike by workers and employees, they continued their struggle against the reactionary policies of freezing wages and suppressing the masses. According to reports, state railway workers continued their strike after the general strike, demanding the payment of overdue June salaries, which paralyzed railway transportation. Employees of some national banks also went on strike and held flash mob gatherings on the 2nd to protest the authorities' dismissal of 44 employees who participated in the general strike. University students in Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay, held another demonstration on the 3rd to protest the government's measures to suppress mass movements.

　　拉美人民不断展开反独裁统治斗争
　　玻利维亚大学生示威游行反对军事独裁　哥伦比亚教师展开罢教运动
    新华社四日讯　拉丁美洲一些国家的人民不断开展斗争，反对统治当局出卖民族利益、加紧剥削劳动人民和镇压群众的反动措施。
    玻利维亚数百名大学生和工人二日晚在中部农业中心地区科恰班巴举行示威游行，抗议亲美军事独裁政府最近同美资海湾石油公司签订的出卖石油资源的协定。反动当局出动军警，使用步枪、催泪弹和警犬来驱散示威群众，示威者同军警展开激烈的搏斗。他们扣留了一名警察和一名政府官员，并且占领了当地的一所大学。
    这次示威是在玻利维亚总统视察科恰班巴附近的农业中心乌库雷纳以及当局宣布禁止游行和实行戒严令的情况下举行的。在示威过程中，有两名学生牺牲，十人受伤，一百多人被捕。示威者对当局的镇压暴行极为愤慨，他们要求立即释放被捕的群众，并要求科恰班巴省的省长辞职。
    七月三十一日，玻利维亚首都拉巴斯的近千名大学生也举行了一次反对军事独裁统治的示威游行。示威者高呼“打倒军事统治”和其他反对巴里恩托斯独裁政权的口号。
    在哥伦比亚，由于美帝国主义加紧掠夺，经济日益恶化，统治当局一再拖延支付教师的工资。最近哥伦比亚公立学校的教师展开了大规模的罢教运动。七月中旬以来，由桑坦德省开始的要求支付拖欠工资的罢教运动很快发展到全国各地，先后罢教的有孔迪纳马卡、乔科、拉瓜西拉、大西洋、马格达莱纳、托利马和梅塔等省的教师，参加罢教的人数达两万六千多名。教师的斗争得到工人和其他阶层人民的广泛支援。
    在乌拉圭，工人、职员一日举行二十四小时总罢工之后，继续进行斗争，反对冻结工资和镇压群众的反动政策。
    据报道，国营铁路工人在总罢工之后继续举行罢工，要求支付六月份的拖欠工资，罢工使铁路运输陷于瘫痪。一些国家银行的职工二日也举行罢工和举行闪电集会，抗议当局解雇参加总罢工的四十四名职员。乌拉圭首都蒙得维的亚的大学生三日再次举行示威游行，抗议政府镇压群众运动的措施。
