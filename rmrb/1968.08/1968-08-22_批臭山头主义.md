Mountainism is a major enemy in implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. It is an enemy of closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions, and seizing the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It is an enemy of the dictatorship of the proletariat. With the enemy in front of us, we must defeat it.

China's Khrushchev stands on the reactionary bourgeois position and vigorously advocates mountainism. He attempts to use mountainism to sabotage the Party's centralized and unified leadership and resist and sabotage the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, which is the sole leadership center for the entire Party, the entire army, and the entire nation. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Yan'an was the place where the great leader Chairman Mao led and commanded the nation's people in their resistance against Japan. It was a revolutionary holy land recognized by the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world. However, when China's Khrushchev fled to Suibei Yancity, he raved: "There is a Yan'an in Shaanbei, and there is a Yancity in Suibei." It is clear that his wolfish ambition is to establish another mountain and another "center" there to oppose the great leader Chairman Mao. Even after liberation, he still could not forget about the mountain. On one hand, he maliciously propagandized the history of the mountain, falsely claiming that without relying on the mountain, one "cannot resist the war" and "without the mountain, there would be no People's Republic of China," preparing public opinion to seize the Party and the country. On the other hand, he actively recruited traitors, gathered demons and monsters, and assembled a bourgeois headquarters hidden within the dictatorship of the proletariat, attempting to use his "mountain" as a stronghold to turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.

However, as the great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The ant climbing the locust tree boasts of a great country, the cicada shaking the tree talks of what is easy." Throughout history, all reactionaries have always ended up with the stone they lifted falling on their own feet. In the history of our Party's revolutionary struggles, those who opposed Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's correct leadership, established their own mountains, and engaged in large-scale independent kingdoms, have all met with bad ends. China's Khrushchev, the biggest capitalist-roader and the biggest right-opportunist splitter within the Party, has now been thrown into the garbage heap of history and has received the shameful end he deserved.

Mountainism is reactionary, and those who engage in large-scale mountainism will not have a good outcome because it goes against Mao Zedong Thought and the fundamental interests of the broad revolutionary masses. The core of proletarian ideology is "publicness." Vice Chairman Lin said: "Communism can be called 'public' productionism." Mountainism is centered on "privateness" and caters to the needs of the exploiting classes. Therefore, mountainism and the interests of the Party and the people are incompatible. For this reason, the great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must advocate considering the overall situation. Every Party member, every local work, every word or action, must take the interests of the entire Party as the starting point and absolutely not allow any deviation from this principle."

We revolutionary soldiers, at any time and under any circumstances, act according to Chairman Mao's great teachings. To better complete the glorious task of "grasp revolution, promote production" given to us by Chairman Mao, once the higher-ups ordered us to detach a platoon of comrades to assist a sister platoon in digging a tunnel. During the construction, an unexpected obstacle suddenly appeared in the cave. If the previous shift did not remove it, it would bring difficulties to the entire construction. However, to remove it would affect the completion of the current shift's task. At that time, some comrades thought that if the task was not completed, not only would they not be praised, but they would also be criticized, and they should find a way to complete the current shift's task. At that time, everyone thought of the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings: "Communist Party members must understand the principle of subordinating local needs to overall needs." They realized that to only complete their own task without considering the overall interests was to fall victim to the poison of mountainism, individualism, and the pursuit of fame and profit advocated by China's Khrushchev. We must use practical actions to thoroughly criticize China's Khrushchev. Therefore, everyone resolutely abandoned local interests and cleared the way for the victory of the entire task. Comrades said: "We are willing to give up our own local interests to preserve the overall interests." Comrades were full of enthusiasm, going where the difficulties were, doing what was urgent, with all officers and soldiers having one mind and one action, creating favorable conditions for the overall situation, and finally completing the entire task ahead of schedule.

The great leader Chairman Mao's teachings on strengthening the concept of the whole are the fundamental guarantee of our victory and a powerful ideological weapon to eliminate the poison of mountainism and individualism spread by China's Khrushchev. We deeply feel that: if we fall for China's Khrushchev's tricks, lack an overall perspective, establish our own mountains, act independently, only care for ourselves, and not for the whole, it will cause serious damage to the revolutionary cause.

China's Khrushchev's propaganda that the victory of the Chinese revolution was achieved through mountains is a distortion of right and wrong, a confusion of black and white, and a thoroughly reactionary fallacy. Is it not the victory of Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line that achieved the victory of our country's democratic revolution, rather than mountainism? Is it not the Chinese people, united under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, rather than each pulling their own mountain, that achieved the great victories of the socialist revolution and socialist construction? China's Khrushchev spreads these fallacies in an attempt to sow discord between the revolutionary people and the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, disperse the unity of the revolutionary ranks based on Mao Zedong Thought, obstruct the implementation of the proletarian revolutionary line, and ultimately achieve his goal of seizing the Party, the army, and the government. Of course, this is just a pipe dream.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All reactionary things, if you do not strike them, they will not fall." We revolutionary soldiers are determined, under the unified command of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, to raise high the banner of revolutionary criticism, and thoroughly eliminate the poison of mountainism, individualism, and other revisionist ideas spread by China's Khrushchev!

    批臭山头主义
    解放军某部指导员　毛文祥
    山头主义是执行毛主席无产阶级革命路线的大敌，是紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署、全面落实毛主席一系列最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的大敌，是无产阶级专政的大敌。大敌当前，我们必须把它打倒。
    中国赫鲁晓夫站在反动的资产阶级立场上，极力鼓吹山头主义。他妄图利用山头主义破坏党的集中统一领导，抵抗和破坏以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部这个全党、全军、全国唯一的领导中心。在抗日战争时期，延安是伟大领袖毛主席领导和指挥全国人民抗战的地方，是中国人民和世界革命人民公认的革命圣地。中国赫鲁晓夫当他跑到苏北盐城时却疯狂地叫嚣：“陕北有个延安，苏北有个盐城。”很明显，他的狼子野心，就是要在那里另立一个山头，另立一个“中心”，同伟大领袖毛主席相对抗。直到解放后，他还念念不忘山头。他一方面别有用心地宣扬山头的历史，胡说什么不依靠山头就“抗不了战”，“没有山头，就没有中华人民共和国”，为他篡党、篡国制造舆论准备；另一方面则积极招降纳叛，网罗牛鬼蛇神，拼凑一个隐藏在无产阶级专政内部的资产阶级司令部，妄图以他的这个“山头”为大本营，变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政。
    但是，正如伟大领袖毛主席指出的：“蚂蚁缘槐夸大国，蚍蜉撼树谈何易。”古今中外一切反动派总是搬起石头砸自己的脚。在我们党领导革命斗争的历史上，凡是反对毛泽东思想、反对毛主席的正确领导，自立山头、大搞独立王国的，都没有好下场。中国赫鲁晓夫这个党内最大的走资派、最大的右倾分裂主义者，现在也已经被抛进了历史的垃圾堆，得到了他应得的可耻下场。
    山头主义所以是反动的，大搞山头主义的人决不会有好的结果，因为它违背毛泽东思想，违反广大革命人民的根本利益。无产阶级思想的核心是“公”字。林副主席说：“共产主义可以叫做‘公’产主义”。山头主义是以“私”字为核心的，它适应剥削阶级的需要。因此，山头主义和党的人民的利益是水火不相容的。正因为这样，伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“要提倡顾全大局。每一个党员，每一种局部工作，每一项言论或行动，都必须以全党利益为出发点，绝对不许可违反这个原则。”
    我们革命战士不论在任何时候，在任何情况下，都是按照毛主席的这一伟大教导去做的。为了更好地完成毛主席交给我们的“抓革命，促生产”的光荣任务，有一次上级要我们连抽调一个排的同志配合兄弟连开挖隧道。在施工中，山洞内突然出现了意外的障碍，如果我们前一个工班不把它排除，就会给整个施工带来困难。但是要去排除，就会影响本工班任务的完成。这时有的同志曾想，如果完不成任务，不仅得不到表扬，而且还会受批评，想办法把本工班的任务完成就算了。这时大家想起了伟大领袖毛主席的教导：“共产党员必须懂得以局部需要服从全局需要这一个道理。”认识到光为了自己完成任务，不顾全局利益，不正是中了中国赫鲁晓夫所鼓吹的山头主义、个人主义、名利思想的流毒了吗？我们要用实际行动来彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫。于是大家毅然决然地放弃了局部利益，为胜利完成整个任务扒碴铺道。同志们说：“宁愿丢掉自己这个局部的利益，也要保住全局的利益。”同志们个个干劲冲天，那里最困难就往那里上，什么最急就干什么，全连干部、战士一个心眼、一致行动，要为全局创造有利条件，终于使整个任务超额完成。
    伟大领袖毛主席关于加强整体观念的教导，是我们取得胜利的根本保证，也是我们肃清中国赫鲁晓夫散布的山头主义、个人主义流毒的强大思想武器。我们深深体会到：如果上了中国赫鲁晓夫的当，没有全局观点，自立山头，各行其是，只顾自己，不顾整体，就会给革命事业造成严重损失。
    中国赫鲁晓夫宣扬的什么中国革命取得的胜利是靠了山头，这是颠倒是非，混淆黑白，是反动透顶的谬论。难道我国民主革命的胜利，不是靠毛主席、靠毛泽东思想、靠毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，而是靠山头主义才取得胜利的吗？难道中国人民不是团结在以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的周围，而是各拉山头，才取得社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大胜利吗？中国赫鲁晓夫散布这些谬论，是妄图离间革命人民和以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的血肉联系，涣散革命队伍在毛泽东思想基础上的团结，阻碍无产阶级革命路线的贯彻执行，从而达到他篡党、篡军、篡政的目的。当然，这只能是白日做梦，痴心妄想。
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。”我们革命战士决心在以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部统一指挥下，高举革命大批判的旗帜，彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫散布的山头主义、个人主义等等修正主义流毒！
