Highly Hold High the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought
Thoroughly Criticize the Revisionist Literary Line and Its Backstage Boss
Refuting Zhou Yang's "The New Does Not Come, the Old Does Not Go"

Cheng Jiyao, Yao Yongliang, PLA Unit

In December 1963, our great leader Chairman Mao issued a directive on literature and art, which pointed out in a penetrating manner: "In many departments, 'dead people' are still in charge," "Many communists enthusiastically promote feudal and capitalist art, but are not enthusiastic about promoting socialist art. Isn't this astonishing?" Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's directive, Comrade Jiang Qing led revolutionary literary and art warriors to launch a more vigorous attack on the feudal stronghold of Peking Opera, where "dead people" rule most stubbornly.

The counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and art patriarch Zhou Yang, disguised as a "communist," and his master, the Chinese Khrushchev, were taken aback. They quickly organized a counterattack. On January 3, 1964, the Chinese Khrushchev personally presided over a "literary and art symposium." At this meeting, Zhou Yang, with ulterior motives, said: "The new does not come, the old does not go," "There are many literary and art issues, but the key is to create socialist works. When there are more good ones, they will gradually squeeze out the old things." At first glance, Zhou Yang seems to be "enthusiastically promoting" socialist art. In fact, this is not the case. Analyzed with Mao Zedong Thought, it is clear that this is sheer black talk, a counter-revolutionary theory to sabotage the Peking Opera revolution.

"The new does not come, the old does not go," does the old not go because the new has not come? Does the old go away once the new comes? This is sheer nonsense!

Chairman Mao tells us: "Truth is developed in the struggle against falsehood." "Socialism, this new thing, its birth must go through a serious struggle with the old thing to be realized." Throughout history, until now, there has never been an old thing that voluntarily gave way to a new thing, nor has there been a new thing that was born in a calm situation. There has never been such a precedent in human history. Moreover, without criticizing the old world, the new world cannot appear; without criticizing the old things, the new things cannot be discovered. Capitalism emerged in the criticism of feudalism and developed in the struggle against feudalism; socialism emerged in the criticism of capitalism and developed in the struggle against capitalism. The same is true in the arts.

In the more than ten years since national liberation, feudal culture, imperialist culture, and capitalist culture have not automatically retreated just because a socialist new China has appeared; emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties, ghosts and monsters have not voluntarily yielded just because the proletariat and peasant masses have become the masters of the state. These cultures of the exploiting classes not only stubbornly cling to the socialist literary and art stage and refuse to leave, but also vigorously obstruct the growth of socialist new literature and art. Comrade Jiang Qing led revolutionary literary and art warriors to develop proletarian revolutionary new literature and art in the criticism of old plays, creating many revolutionary model operas, and opening a brilliant new chapter in the history of human literature and art. However, every step forward has to go through arduous struggles. Not only does every performance, every character creation, but even changing a line of lyrics or adding a movement encounter numerous obstacles. In short, as soon as new culture raises its head, it has to struggle with old culture. Without struggle, not even a small reform is possible. "Without destruction, there is no construction; without blocking, there is no flow; without stopping, there is no progress." Without smashing reactionary culture, no new culture can be established.

Zhou Yang fundamentally denies the criticism of old things and fundamentally denies the struggle between new and old things, advocating what he calls "the new does not come, the old does not go." This is a pure bourgeois "establish first, destroy later" reactionary philosophy! Its purpose is to not allow destruction or construction, "to make every effort to preserve the old thing so that it can escape death."

"The literary and art issues are numerous, but the key is to create socialist works." Zhou Yang's words sound so grand, but they hide a heart of restoring capitalism. Whether or not to criticize the art of the exploiting classes is the dividing line between truly and falsely promoting socialist new literature and art.

Comrade Jiang Qing, starting from investigation and research, presented a shocking figure: there are 3,000 drama troupes nationwide, and 2,800 of them perform only emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties. The remaining "drama troupes" and "cultural work troupes" are mostly "big, foreign, and old," dominated by "foreigners" and "dead people," creating public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. The handful of capitalist-roaders in power, led by the Chinese Khrushchev, frantically applaud and cheer for them. They are particularly crazy about sabotaging and destroying Comrade Jiang Qing's leadership of the Peking Opera revolution, according to Chairman Mao's great directive, not allowing Peking Opera to reflect socialist revolution and construction, not allowing worker-peasant-soldier heroes to reclaim the literary and art stage occupied by emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties. In a word, they do not allow the creation of socialist works. This is the root cause of "numerous literary and art issues"!

Zhou Yang does not mention the fact that there is serious class struggle in the literary and art circles since national liberation, nor does he mention the serious fact that capitalist, feudal, and revisionist literature and art are rampant under his support, suppressing and excluding socialist new literature and art. Instead, he blames the phenomenon of "dead people" ruling on "the lack of socialist things, unable to occupy the position," advocating "establish first," whose "center" is to not allow socialist new literature and art to struggle against the old literature and art of the exploiting classes, to not allow the almost occupied entire drama stage of the exploiting classes' literature and art.

Our beloved Comrade Jiang Qing, with an extremely sharp proletarian perspective, saw through Zhou Yang's black heart at a glance. She engaged in a head-on struggle with Zhou Yang and his gang, exposing their evil plot to protect old literature and art and strangle revolutionary new literature and art. Comrade Jiang Qing is not only engaged in opera but is also fighting against feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism! The numerous problems in the literary and art circles can only be solved through the struggle against the literature and art of the exploiting classes.

Zhou Yang also said: "When there are more good ones, they will gradually squeeze out the old things." The old fox is playing tricks again.

Chairman Mao said: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for seizing power and consolidating power. And the counter-revolutionaries fight to the death with revolutionary forces, also completely for maintaining their power." The same is true on the Peking Opera stage. To thoroughly drive down emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties, it is not just a matter of whether there are good works or not, but first of all, it is a matter of seizing the power of the literary and art stage. Any ruling class, any power, does not allow the spread of thoughts contrary to it. Zhou Yang and his gang, with the support of the Chinese Khrushchev, established bourgeois rule on the literary and art stage and implemented bourgeois dictatorship. This old stage does not allow the spread of proletarian thoughts, let alone allow proletarian literature and art to "gradually squeeze out" the old things of the exploiting classes. The counter-revolutionary revisionists who occupy this old stage, as long as they discover the growth of proletarian literature and art, even if it is just a small sprout, they will wield an axe to ruthlessly destroy it. The arduous journey experienced by the Peking Opera revolution led by Comrade Jiang Qing is a good illustration. Those counter-revolutionary revisionists who occupy the Peking Opera position, with the support of the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the party, set up numerous checkpoints, creating obstacles everywhere, not providing actors, not providing theaters, and even more viciously sending people to monitor our beloved Comrade Jiang Qing. These bastards, while frantically destroying the creation, rehearsal, and performance of revolutionary modern Peking Opera, desperately consolidate and expand the old opera's territory. They once collected 180 old plays, using "political tasks" and "economic tasks" as names, forcing the drama troupe that Comrade Jiang Qing led to experiment with to perform, attempting to drive away Comrade Jiang Qing. This is such a cruel bourgeois dictatorship! Without breaking this bourgeois dictatorship, without seizing the power of the Peking Opera stage, can socialist literary and art flowers bloom?

Zhou Yang fundamentally denies that the proletariat must carry out a class revolution on the literary and art stage to overthrow one class by another class, fundamentally denies: "The dictatorship of the proletariat in the superstructure, including in various cultural fields." Instead, he talks about "gradually squeezing out the old things." His purpose is to maintain the bourgeois dictatorship on the literary and art stage.

Peeling off the skin of the counter-revolutionary two-faced Zhou Yang, the demon's hideous face is revealed. He is the watchdog for the literature and art of the exploiting classes, the executioner who wields a broken axe to strangle the Peking Opera revolution!

The watchdog cannot block the thousand-pound hammer of the proletarian revolutionaries, and the executioner's broken axe cannot cut down the great flag of the Peking Opera revolution. Under the strong support of our great leader Chairman Mao and the personal leadership of Comrade Jiang Qing, revolutionary literary and art warriors have achieved great victories in the Peking Opera revolution, seizing the power of the Peking Opera stage, establishing proletarian dictatorship, and taking the great victory of the Peking Opera revolution.

"The goddess should be fine, and the world should be astonished." "The Red Lantern" and other eight proletarian art gems shining with the great brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought appeared on the socialist literary and art stage, shocking all of China and shaking the world!

The great Peking Opera revolution has turned over the history that was turned over by the old stage. This reversal will forever press Zhou Yang, this clown, to the bottom of the stage, never to rise again!

### 斥周扬的“新的不来，旧的不去”

    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗
    彻底批判修正主义文艺黑线及其总后台
    斥周扬的“新的不来，旧的不去”
    解放军某部　程继尧　姚永亮
    一九六三年十二月，伟大领袖毛主席对文学艺术的批示，一针见血地指出：“许多部门至今还是‘死人’统治着”，“许多共产党人热心提倡封建主义和资本主义的艺术，却不热心提倡社会主义的艺术，岂非咄咄怪事。”在毛主席批示的指引下，江青同志率领革命文艺战士向京剧这个“死人”统治最顽固的封建主义堡垒发起了更猛烈的进攻。
    披着“共产党员”外衣的反革命修正主义文艺祖师爷周扬及其主子中国赫鲁晓夫慌了手脚，急忙组织反扑。一九六四年一月三日，中国赫鲁晓夫亲自出马，主持了一个“文艺座谈会”。在这个会上，周扬心怀鬼胎地说：“新的不来，旧的不去”，“文艺问题一大堆，中心还是要搞社会主义的作品，好的多了，逐渐排挤掉旧的东西。”乍一听，周扬似乎是“热心提倡”社会主义艺术的。其实不然，用毛泽东思想一分析，就可看出，这是地地道道的黑话，是他破坏京剧革命的一个反革命理论。
      “新的不来，旧的不去”，旧的不去是因为新的没来吗？新的一来，旧的就去了吗？这简直是一派胡言！
    毛主席告诉我们：“真理是在同谬误作斗争中间发展起来的。”“社会主义这样一个新事物，它的出生，是要经过同旧事物的严重斗争才能实现的。”查遍青史千万载，直到现在，没有一件旧事物曾经自愿让路给新事物，没有一件新事物能在风平浪静的情况下出生，人类历史上没有过这种先例。而且，不批判旧世界，就出现不了新世界，不批判旧事物，就发现不了新事物。资本主义是在批判封建主义中发生，在同封建主义作斗争中发展起来的；社会主义是在批判资本主义中发生，在同资本主义作斗争中发展起来的。文艺上同样是如此。
    全国解放十几年来，封建主义文化、帝国主义文化、资本主义文化，并没有因为出现了一个社会主义新中国而自动退走；帝王将相、才子佳人、妖魔鬼怪并没有因为无产阶级工农大众当了国家的主人而自愿让位。这些剥削阶级文化不仅死死赖在社会主义文艺舞台上不走，而且，还极力阻止社会主义新文艺的生长。江青同志率领革命文艺战士，在批判旧戏舞台中，发展了无产阶级的革命新文艺，创造了许多革命样板戏，在人类文艺史上揭开了光辉灿烂的新篇章。可是，每前进一步都要经过艰苦的斗争。不仅每排一场戏、每塑造一个人物，就是改一句唱词，增加一个动作，都要遇到重重阻挠。总之，新文化一抬头，就得和旧文化作斗争。不斗争，连一个小小的改良都不可能。“不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行”，不把反动文化打下去，什么新文化也是建立不起来的。
    周扬根本否认对旧事物的批判，根本否认新旧事物的斗争，奢谈什么“新的不来，旧的不去”，这是地地道道的资产阶级“先立后破”的反动哲学！其目的就是不准破、不准立，“以种种努力去保持旧事物使它得免于死亡”。
      “文艺问题一大堆，中心还是要搞社会主义的作品”。周扬此话说得多么冠冕堂皇，其实包藏着一颗复辟资本主义的黑心。破不破剥削阶级的文艺，是真搞还是假搞社会主义新文艺的分水岭。
    江青同志从调查研究着手，提出了一个惊心动魄的数字：全国剧团是三千个，专演帝王将相、才子佳人的竟达二千八百多个。剩下的一些“话剧团”“文工团”，也大半是“一大、二洋、三古”，被“洋人”“死人”统治着，为复辟资本主义大造舆论。而以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派则拚命为之鼓掌叫好。他们特别疯狂地刁难、破坏江青同志根据毛主席的伟大指示，亲自领导的京剧革命，不准京剧反映社会主义革命和建设，不让工农兵英雄人物夺回被帝王将相、才子佳人霸占的文艺阵地。一句话，他们根本不准搞社会主义的作品。这就是“文艺问题一大堆”的根本所在！
    周扬闭口不谈全国解放后文艺界存在严重阶级斗争的事实，闭口不谈资本主义、封建主义、修正主义文艺正在他的支持下到处泛滥，打击排挤社会主义新文艺的严重事实，却把“死人”统治的现象归罪于“社会主义的东西少了，不能占领阵地”，鼓吹“立字当头”，其“中心”就是不准社会主义新文艺向剥削阶级旧文艺作斗争，不准破几乎占领了我们全部戏剧舞台的剥削阶级文艺。
    我们敬爱的江青同志以无比尖锐的无产阶级眼光，一眼看穿了周扬的黑心。她和周扬等一伙进行了针锋相对的斗争，揭穿了他们保护旧文艺，扼杀革命新文艺的罪恶阴谋。江青同志不仅是在搞戏，而且是和封建主义、资本主义、修正主义战斗！文艺界的一大堆问题只有通过和剥削阶级文艺的战斗才能解决。
    周扬还说什么：“好的多了，逐渐排挤掉旧的东西。”老狐狸又在耍花招了。
    毛主席说：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”京剧舞台上也同样，要彻底把帝王将相、才子佳人打下台，不光是有没有好作品的问题，首先是夺取文艺舞台的大权的问题。任何一个统治阶级，任何一个政权，它是不许可同它相反的阶级的思想传播的。周扬一伙在中国赫鲁晓夫的支持下，在文艺舞台上建立资产阶级统治，实行资产阶级专政。这个旧戏舞台是不许可无产阶级思想传播的，更不会许可无产阶级文艺“逐渐排挤掉”剥削阶级的旧东西。盘踞在这个旧戏舞台上的反革命修正主义分子，只要一发现无产阶级文艺的生长，那怕是一点点小苗苗，就要抡起板斧拚命摧残。江青同志领导的京剧革命所经历的艰险路程，就是很好的说明。那些盘踞在京剧阵地上的反革命修正主义分子，在他们的后台党内最大的一小撮走资派的支持下，大设关卡，处处刁难，不给演员，不给剧场，更恶劣的是甚至派人对我们敬爱的江青同志监视。这些坏蛋一面疯狂地破坏革命现代京剧的创作、排练、演出，一面拚命地巩固和发展旧戏的地盘。他们曾搜罗一百八十个老剧目，以“政治任务”和“经济任务”为名，强迫江青同志种试验田的剧团上演，妄图挤走江青同志。这是多么残酷的资产阶级专政！不把这个资产阶级专政打破，不把京剧舞台上的大权夺过来，能够长出社会主义的文艺香花来吗？
    周扬根本否认无产阶级必须在文艺舞台上进行一个阶级推翻另一个阶级的革命，根本否认：“无产阶级在上层建筑其中包括在各个文化领域的专政”。却空谈什么“逐渐排挤掉旧的东西”。其目的，就是为了维持文艺舞台上的资产阶级专政。
    剥开反革命两面派周扬的画皮，这个恶鬼的狰狞面目昭然若揭了。他是替剥削阶级文艺看家的叭儿狗，他是挥舞破斧扼杀京剧革命的刽子手！
    叭儿狗挡不住无产阶级革命派的千钧棒，刽子手的破斧砍不断京剧革命的大旗。在伟大领袖毛主席的有力支持下，在江青同志的亲自率领下，革命文艺战士在京剧舞台上大破大立，夺得了京剧舞台上的大权，建立了无产阶级专政，取得了京剧革命的伟大胜利。
      “神女应无恙，当惊世界殊。”《红灯记》等八个闪耀着毛泽东思想伟大光辉的无产阶级艺术明珠出现在社会主义的文艺舞台上，轰动了全中国，震动了全世界！
    伟大的京剧革命把旧戏舞台颠倒了的历史又颠倒过来了。这个再颠倒将永远把周扬这个小丑压在台底下，永世别想翻身！
