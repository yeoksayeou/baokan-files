	Sato's reactionary government's frenzied anti-China stance will only lead to its own demise as a sacrifice to U.S. imperialism. Sato shouts that Japan must "maintain the Japan-U.S. security system" and continue to obstruct the restoration of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations.

	New China News Agency, August 10th: Tokyo reports: Sato Eisaku, the Japanese Prime Minister who is willing to be a lackey of U.S. imperialism, recently in the House of Representatives answered questions from a member of the Socialist Party, once again expressing his determination to stubbornly execute the policy of following U.S. imperialism in its hostility towards China.

	Sato shouted that Japan must "maintain the Japan-U.S. security system," and in order to adapt to this system, Japan has "made efforts to gradually strengthen its self-defense forces." This is another admission by the Sato government of its military hostility towards China.

	Since the signing of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" by the Japanese and U.S. reactionaries eight years ago, the military alliance has always been directed against socialist China. At that time, the Japanese Foreign Minister boasted that the area of applicability of the Japan-U.S. military alliance included the regions north of the Philippines, the Chinese coast, and other regions around Japan. The then Japanese Prime Minister, Kishi Nobusuke, even more blatantly screamed that according to this treaty, the Japanese military "can operate on the high seas" and can be sent abroad to "attack the enemy's bases." After Sato Eisaku came to power, in order to more actively fulfill the "obligations" stipulated in the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, on the one hand, through the third military expansion plan, he increased militaristic forces and schemed to send troops abroad; on the other hand, he conspired with the puppet regime in South Korea and the Kuomintang bandits occupying our territory in Taiwan to form a Northeast Asian military alliance, and tightly colluded with the Soviet revisionists to form a U.S.-Japan-Soviet anti-China alliance encircling China. According to a recent revelation by the "Ryukyu Shimpo," in May of this year, the Sato government established a microwave communication line between the Japanese island of Shimane Prefecture's Hamada and South Korea's Busan, and at the same time, is hurriedly laying an 850-kilometer underwater cable between Japan's Niigata Prefecture's Suibara and the Soviet Union's Nakhodka to complete the communication network encircling China. Sato's shouting in the Diet to maintain the Japan-U.S. "security system" indicates that the Japanese reactionaries will continue to collude with U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism to threaten China militarily.

	In answering the questions, Sato also expressed his intention to continue obstructing the restoration of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations. Sato said: "There is no need to change or supplement the policy adopted so far regarding the issue of China's representation in the United Nations." So far, the Sato government has always followed the lead of U.S. imperialism in the United Nations, frantically obstructing the restoration of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations, and forcibly inserting the representatives of the Kuomintang bandits, who are political zombies, into the United Nations to promote its "two Chinas" plot. Sato's reiteration of his so-called "policy adopted so far" only exposes his reactionary stance of politically opposing China.

	In discussing Sino-Japanese exchanges, Sato repeated his infamous "political and economic separation" cliché, indicating his intention to continue the reactionary policy of politically opposing China and attempting to gain economic benefits.

	The Sato government is so rampant in its anti-China stance, completely in order to adapt to the needs of U.S. imperialism's policy of aggression and war. U.S. imperialism is being beaten to a pulp in Vietnam, in a miserable state; in the United States, the people's movement is surging, and the financial crisis is becoming increasingly serious, all of which are powerful blows to the rule of Wall Street. The Johnson administration, which is in trouble both internally and externally, is currently in dire need of the Japanese reactionaries to work hard for it. However, no matter how hard the Sato government works as a lackey for U.S. imperialism and how frenziedly it opposes China, it will absolutely not be able to save U.S. imperialism from its inevitable failure. Sato and his ilk stubbornly insist on a pro-U.S. and anti-China policy, and in the end, they can only sacrifice themselves for U.S. imperialism.

　　佐藤反动政府疯狂反华只能为美帝殉葬
　　佐藤叫嚷要“坚持日美安全体制”并要继续阻挠恢复中国在联合国的合法权利
    新华社十日讯　东京消息：甘心充当美帝走卒的日本首相佐藤荣作，最近在众议院回答社会党议员的质询时，再次表示要顽固地执行追随美帝敌视中国的政策。
    佐藤叫嚷说，日本要“坚持日美安全体制”，为了适应这一体制，日本“作出了逐渐增强自卫力量的努力”。这是佐藤政府从军事上敌视中国的又一次自供。
    自从八年前日美反动派缔结日美“安全条约”以来，这一军事同盟的矛头一直是指向社会主义中国的。当时的日本外相扬言，日美军事同盟的适用地区，包括菲律宾以北，中国沿海和日本周围的其他地区。当时的日本首相岸信介更露骨地狂叫，根据这个条约，日本军队“可以在公海上出动”，可以派到国外去“进攻敌人的基地”。佐藤荣作上台后，为了更积极地履行日美军事同盟条约所规定的“义务”，一面通过第三次扩军计划，增加军国主义力量，阴谋准备派兵出国；一面同南朝鲜傀儡集团和盘踞在我国领土台湾的蒋介石匪帮拼凑东北亚军事同盟，并同苏修加紧勾结，构成包围中国的日美苏反华同盟。据《长周新闻》最近揭露，今年五月间，佐藤政府同南朝鲜傀儡集团在日本岛根县的滨田和南朝鲜的釜山之间，建立了微波通讯电路，同时在日本新澙县的直江津和苏联的纳霍德卡之间，正在加紧敷设八百五十公里的海底电缆，以完成包围中国的电讯网。佐藤在国会上叫嚷要坚持日美“安全体制”，表明日本反动派将继续勾结美帝苏修，从军事上威胁中国。
    佐藤在回答质询时，还表示要继续阻挠恢复中国在联合国的合法席位。佐藤说：“中国在联合国的代表权问题，现在没有发生任何需要变更或者补充迄今采取的方针的情况”。迄今为止，佐藤政府在联合国一直跟着美帝的手指头跳舞，疯狂地阻挠恢复中国在联合国的合法权利，而把政治僵尸蒋匪帮的代表硬塞在联合国内，以推行其“两个中国”的阴谋。佐藤重申他的所谓“迄今采取的方针”，只能暴露他从政治上敌视中国的反动立场。
    在谈到日中往来时，佐藤重弹其臭名昭彰的“政治、经济分离”的滥调，表示要继续推行在政治上敌视中国，并妄图在经济上捞取实惠的反动政策。
    佐藤政府如此猖狂地反华，完全是为了适应美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策的需要。美帝国主义在越南被打得头破血流，狼狈不堪；在美国国内，人民运动汹涌澎湃，财政金融危机日益严重，这些都有力地冲击着华尔街的统治。内外交困的约翰逊政府，目前特别需要日本反动派为它卖力。但是，不论佐藤政府如何起劲地充当美帝的马前卒，如何疯狂地反华，也绝对挽救不了美帝彻底失败的命运。佐藤之流顽固地坚持亲美反华政策，到头来只能为美帝殉葬。
