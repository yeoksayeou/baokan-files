Looking back at the two-year-long struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, under the unified leadership and command of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, hundreds of millions of soldiers and civilians across the nation have taken up the mighty weapon of Mao Zedong Thought to smash the bourgeois headquarters, headed by China's Khrushchev, which had long been hiding within our Party. We have achieved decisive victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We deeply feel that the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin is the sole leadership center guiding the entire Party, the entire army, the entire nation, and all revolutionary people to victory. Without the sun, nothing can grow; without such a leadership center, the revolutionary people cannot advance to victory. Only by closely uniting around this leadership center, strengthening the proletarian concept of the whole, and strengthening revolutionary organizational discipline, can we, under the command of the proletarian headquarters, unite our wills, unite our steps, and unite our actions to achieve comprehensive victory in this "political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes."

The broad revolutionary masses have unlimited love and loyalty for the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao. However, the reactionary "multi-center theory" aims to disperse the unity of the revolutionary ranks based on Mao Zedong Thought, hinder the implementation of the proletarian revolutionary line, and disrupt the great strategic deployments of the proletarian headquarters. If we do not heighten our revolutionary vigilance, do not strengthen the proletarian concept of the whole, and do not seriously implement the various instructions and orders of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, we will give the class enemy opportunities to exploit.

Last year, we went to a certain factory to carry out the task of supporting the left. Because a handful of class enemies used bourgeois factionalism to split the revolutionary ranks, deceive some masses to establish "mountaintops," vie for "cores," and wage "internal wars," they did not engage in revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination. This greatly affected the revolution and production. Therefore, we, together with the revolutionary masses, studied the "Old Five Articles" and Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "Within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to necessarily split into two diametrically opposed factions." This helped everyone raise their proletarian consciousness and strengthen their proletarian concept of the whole. We guided everyone to use the method of "unity—criticism and self-criticism—unity." Through study, everyone realized: we have only one leadership center, which is the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao. The so-called "with me as the center" is the most foolish, a manifestation of bourgeois individualism and factionalism. The existence of this kind of thought will disperse the unity of our revolutionary ranks, deepen differences in opinion, and weaken our revolutionary fighting strength. The more this wrong thought exists, the less unity there is, and the weaker our fighting strength against the class enemy. With heightened awareness, the two revolutionary factions united, quickly achieving revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination. When the masses united, the enemy could no longer hide. After the revolutionary masses exposed the class enemies who were sowing discord, the factory quickly saw a great situation of revolution and production.

In March of this year, our unit went to a certain school for military training. At that time, the bad elements in the school attacked the revolutionary committee of the new students, directly affecting the school's struggle, criticism, and transformation, and the resumption of classes for the revolution. After investigation, we believed that this was a handful of class enemies using anarchist thoughts within the revolutionary ranks, attempting to sabotage the revolutionary committee of the school and disrupt the great strategic deployments of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao. We must quickly expose this enemy plot. Therefore, we, together with the revolutionary teachers and students, organized various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, making the broad revolutionary teachers and students realize that the revolutionary committee is a new thing, and it is inevitable that it will have shortcomings. To give advice, one must start from maintaining and strengthening this whole, and follow Chairman Mao's teachings of "advocating for the overall situation" and "discipline is the guarantee for implementing the line," to strengthen the proletarian concept of the whole. The revolutionary teachers and students realized that engaging in anarchism was falling into the trap of the class enemy. They angrily said: the class enemy spreads anarchism, and we must strengthen revolutionary organizational discipline, resolutely safeguard the new revolutionary committee, and under the command of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, unite our actions to achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Everyone's awareness was raised, and they unanimously exposed the bad elements who were splitting the revolutionary committee, consolidating the revolutionary committee.

Great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Every Party member, every part of the work, every word or action, must start from the interests of the whole Party, and it is absolutely not allowed to violate this principle." From our practice, we deeply feel that strengthening the proletarian concept of the whole and strengthening revolutionary organizational discipline is a major issue related to whether we can follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments. It is a major issue of loyalty to Chairman Mao. Our unit, where Qiu Shaoyun formerly served, has the glorious tradition of the proletarian concept of the whole and high revolutionary organizational discipline. The great internationalist warrior Qiu Shaoyun, in the "391" counterattack battle in Korea, for the sake of maintaining the interests of the proletarian whole, consciously maintained the iron discipline of the proletariat, and gloriously sacrificed his young life. We must take Qiu Shaoyun, the martyr, as a shining example, resolutely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, and resolutely implement the various instructions of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao. Those who understand should implement, and those who do not understand for the time being should also resolutely implement, and in the process of implementation, continuously deepen their understanding.

　　加强无产阶级整体观念，加强革命的组织纪律性
　　邱少云生前所在连
    回顾两年来无产阶级文化大革命的战斗历程，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的统一领导和指挥下，全国亿万军民奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，粉碎了长期隐藏在我们党内的以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，夺取了无产阶级文化大革命决定性胜利。我们深刻体会到：以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，是领导全党、全军、全国和广大革命人民走向胜利的唯一的领导中心。万物没有太阳不能生长，革命人民没有这样一个领导中心，就不能胜利前进。只有紧紧的团结在这个领导中心的周围，加强无产阶级的整体观念，加强革命的组织纪律性，在无产阶级司令部的号令下统一意志、统一步伐、统一行动，才能夺取这场“无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命”的全面胜利。
    广大革命群众对以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部无限热爱、无限忠诚。但是，反动的“多中心论”就是要涣散革命队伍在毛泽东思想基础上的团结，妨碍无产阶级革命路线的贯彻执行，干扰无产阶级司令部的伟大战略部署。如果我们不提高革命警惕，不加强无产阶级的整体观念，不认真贯彻执行毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的各项指示和命令，就会被阶级敌人钻空子。
    去年，我们到某工厂执行支左任务。由于一小撮阶级敌人利用资产阶级派性分裂革命队伍，蒙蔽一些群众立“山头”，争“核心”，打“内战”，不搞革命大联合和革命的三结合，使革命和生产受到很大影响。于是，我们就和革命群众一起学习“老五篇”和毛主席“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织”的最新指示，使大家提高了无产阶级觉悟，加强了无产阶级整体观念。我们又引导大家用“团结——批评和自我批评——团结”的方法，经过学习，大家认识到：我们只有一个领导中心，就是以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部。所谓“以我为中心”是最愚蠢的，是资产阶级个人主义、山头主义的表现。这种思想的存在，会涣散我们革命队伍的团结，加深意见分歧，削弱革命的战斗力。这种错误思想多一分，团结就少一分，对阶级敌人的战斗力就弱一分。认识提高了，两派革命群众团结起来，很快实现了革命大联合和革命的“三结合”。群众联合起来了，敌人就藏不住了。革命群众把挑拨离间的阶级敌人揪出来以后，厂内迅速出现了革命和生产的大好形势。
    今年三月，我们连队来到某学校搞军训。当时，这个学校内的坏人攻击学校新生的革命委员会，直接影响了学校的斗、批、改和复课闹革命。经过调查，我们认为，这是一小撮阶级敌人利用革命队伍中的无政府主义思想，妄图破坏该校革命委员会，干扰以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的伟大战略部署。我们必须迅速揭穿敌人这个阴谋。于是，我们和革命师生一起办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，使广大革命师生认识到革命委员会是一个新生事物，她不可避免地会有缺点。提意见要从维护、加强这个整体出发，要遵照毛主席“提倡顾全大局”和“纪律是执行路线的保证”的教导，加强无产阶级的整体观念。革命师生认识到搞无政府主义是上了阶级敌人的当。他们气愤地说：阶级敌人散布无政府主义，我们就要加强革命的组织纪律性，坚决维护新生的革命委员会，在以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的号令下统一行动，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。大家提高了觉悟，都一致起来把分裂革委会的坏人揭发出来，巩固了革命委员会。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“每一个党员，每一种局部工作，每一项言论或行动，都必须以全党利益为出发点，绝对不许可违反这个原则。”我们从实践中深深体会到：加强无产阶级的整体观念，加强革命的组织纪律性，是关系到能不能紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署的大问题，是对毛主席忠不忠的大问题。我们邱少云生前所在连队，有着无产阶级整体观念和高度革命组织纪律的光荣传统。伟大的国际主义战士邱少云，在朝鲜“三九一”反击战中，为了维护无产阶级整体的利益，自觉地维护无产阶级的钢铁纪律，光荣地献出了年青的生命。我们一定要以邱少云烈士为光辉榜样，坚决紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，坚决执行以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的各项指示。理解的要执行，暂时不理解的也要坚决执行，在执行中不断加深理解。
