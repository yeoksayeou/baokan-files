Chun'an County Revolutionary Committee in Zhejiang Province implements streamlining and efficiency, closely connects with the masses, and the revolutionary and production situation is getting better and better.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Hangzhou on the 2nd, the Revolutionary Committee of Chun'an County in Zhejiang Province, while implementing streamlining and efficiency, insists on putting the study and application of Chairman Mao's works at the forefront of all work in the midst of numerous tasks. They frequently go deep into the grassroots, closely connect with the masses, and play the role of a combat command center in leading the county's revolution and production. Now, the revolutionary committees at all levels in this county are continuously consolidating and developing, and the revolutionary and production situation is getting better and better.

After the establishment of the Chun'an County Revolutionary Committee in late December last year, due to lack of experience and the influence of old habits, they had drawn 84 personnel from various departments to form two departments and one office and 20 groups. Later, they seriously studied the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings on "streamlining and efficiency" and the mass line, and merged the original two departments and one office and 20 groups into three groups: the office, political work, and production command. The number of personnel was reduced from the original 84 to 25. Including 9 standing committee members, the total number of personnel is 34.

After implementing "streamlining and efficiency," the Chun'an County Revolutionary Committee, following Chairman Mao's instruction that "the reform of state organs, the most fundamental point, is to connect with the masses," decided that the nine standing committee members and most of the office personnel should leave the office and go deep into the grassroots, to the front lines of class struggle, and to the remote and backward mountainous areas.

After the leading members of the revolutionary committee went down, they seriously studied the experience of the People's Liberation Army in emphasizing proletarian politics and adhering to the Four Firsts, and in the midst of numerous tasks, they grasped the fundamentals and put the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought at the forefront of all work. Most of the standing committee members of the county revolutionary committee led the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams five times to go deep into more than 40 communes, helping to hold various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They promoted the holding of multiple sessions of study classes in more than 1,000 production brigades across the county. Most of the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres participated in one to several sessions of study classes. Through the holding of study classes, Mao Zedong's series of latest instructions were fully implemented, promoting the deepening of the revolutionary criticism and struggle against the enemy. The revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination in the county were further consolidated and developed.

The Chun'an County Revolutionary Committee also paid attention to using the method of leading by example and promoting typical experiences. The main leaders of the county revolutionary committee went deep into the Jiukeng Commune, carefully summarized the experience of holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes according to the actual struggle at that time, and promoted it throughout the county. The leading members of the county revolutionary committee also specifically helped the Pingmen Commune grasp the fundamentals and deeply carry out the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, setting an example for the revolutionary committees at all levels in the county to learn from.

In implementing "streamlining and efficiency," the Chun'an County Revolutionary Committee greatly simplified meetings, documents, and reports, got rid of administrative affairs, and the nine standing committee members frequently went among the masses and to the grassroots to grasp firsthand materials and implement face-to-face leadership. The members of the revolutionary committee carried forward the Party's fine tradition of hard struggle, often carrying backpacks with Mao Zedong's works, crossing mountains and valleys, going deep into remote mountainous areas, and to the places where class struggle is most acute. Over the past half year, they have traveled to more than 50 communes in the county, going deep into remote villages that the old county committee cadres had never been to. Everywhere they went, they studied with the poor and lower-middle peasants, carried out revolutionary criticism together, and lived, ate, and worked with the masses, bringing Mao Zedong Thought to the doorstep, doing ideological and political work at the doorstep, and actively going to the doorstep to solve problems for the masses, which was highly praised by the broad poor and lower-middle peasants. This spring, the chairman of the county revolutionary committee, Dong Xuejin, went deep into the remote mountainous area of Longchuan Commune, more than 100 li away from the county seat. One night, after a heavy snow, Dong Xuejin still braved the snow and wind, walked more than five li of mountain road, and rushed to a production brigade to attend a meeting with the poor and lower-middle peasants. The poor and lower-middle peasants praised him as a good cadre educated by Chairman Mao. The vice-chairman of the county revolutionary committee, Jin Xigai, originally a veterinarian, after participating in the county revolutionary committee as a representative of the revolutionary masses, often helped production brigades check and treat draft cattle when working at the grassroots. The poor and lower-middle peasants were very moved and praised him as a good servant of the people.

　　打破旧习惯势力影响  彻底改变领导作风
　　浙江省淳安县革委会实行精兵简政，密切联系群众，革命生产形势越来越好
    据新华社杭州二日电　浙江省淳安县革命委员会在实行精兵简政的同时，坚持在千头万绪的工作中狠抓根本，把活学活用毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位，并且经常深入基层，密切联系群众，在领导全县革命和生产中发挥了战斗指挥部的作用。现在，这个县各级革委会不断巩固和发展，革命和生产形势越来越好。
    淳安县革委会在去年十二月初成立后，由于缺乏经验和受到旧的习惯势力的影响，曾从各部门抽调八十四名工作人员，组成两部一室和二十个组。后来，他们认真学习了伟大领袖毛主席关于“精兵简政”和群众路线的一系列教导，把原来的两部一室二十个组合并为办事、政治工作和生产指挥三个组，工作人员从原来的八十四名减少为二十五名。连同九名常委在内，全部人员只有三十四名。
    淳安县革委会实行“精兵简政”以后，遵照毛主席“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众”的教导，决定革委会的九名常委和办事人员大部分走出办公室，深入到基层去，到阶级斗争第一线去，到边远偏僻的山区去。
    县革委会领导成员下去以后，认真学习解放军突出无产阶级政治、坚持四个第一的经验，在千头万绪的工作中狠抓根本，把活学活用毛泽东思想放在一切工作的首位。县革委会大部分常委先后五次带领毛泽东思想宣传队，分头深入到四十多个公社，帮助举办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，推动全县一千多个生产大队普遍举办了多期学习班，全县大部分贫下中农和革命干部都参加了一到几期学习班的学习。通过大办学习班，全面落实了毛主席的一系列最新指示，推动了革命大批判和对敌斗争的深入开展，全县革命大联合、革命三结合进一步巩固和发展。
    淳安县革委会还注意运用以点带面、以典型带一般的工作方法，不断总结和推广先进经验。县革委会主要负责人深入九坑公社，认真总结了他们结合当前斗争实际，有的放矢地办好毛泽东思想学习班的经验，在全县推广，县革委会领导成员还具体帮助屏门公社狠抓根本，深入开展活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，为全县各级革委会树立了学习的榜样。
    淳安县革委会在实行“精兵简政”中，大大精简了会议、公文和报表，摆脱了行政事务，九名常委经常深入群众，到基层去掌握第一手材料，实行面对面的领导。革委会成员发扬党的艰苦奋斗的优良传统，经常背起背包，带着毛主席著作，翻山越岭，深入到偏僻山区去，到阶级斗争最尖锐的地方去。半年多来，他们走遍了全县五十多个公社，深入到了过去旧县委干部从来没有到过的偏僻山村。他们每到一地，都和贫下中农一道学习，一道开展革命大批判，并且和群众同吃同住同劳动，做到把毛泽东思想带上门，把思想政治工作做上门，主动上门为群众解决问题，受到广大贫下中农的热烈赞扬。今年春天，县革委会主任董学金深入到了离县城一百多里的偏僻山区龙川公社。一天夜里，下了大雪，董学金还是冒雪顶风，跑了五里多山路，赶到一个生产队参加贫下中农的会议。贫下中农赞扬他是毛主席教导出来的好干部。县革委会副主任金锡盖，原来是兽医，他作为革命群众代表参加县革委会以后，到基层工作时经常帮助生产队检查和医治耕牛。贫下中农十分感动，赞扬他是人民的好勤务员。
