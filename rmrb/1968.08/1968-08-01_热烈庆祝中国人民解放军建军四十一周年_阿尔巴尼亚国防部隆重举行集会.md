The Albanian Ministry of Defense held a grand meeting to celebrate the 41st anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

Albanian Deputy Minister of Defense Arif Hasko praised the outstanding contributions made by the Chinese People's Liberation Army in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and its role as a strong bastion in the struggle against imperialism and revisionism.

Chinese Military Attaché to Albania Li Zhongxuan emphasized the mutual support and learning between the military forces of China and Albania in their common struggle against imperialism and revisionism, and in support of the world revolution.

New China News Agency, Tirana, July 31st: The Albanian People's Republic Ministry of Defense held a grand meeting in the "People's Army House" in Tirana on the afternoon of the 30th to celebrate the 41st anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

Attendees included: Albanian People's Army Deputy Chief of Staff Vehbi Hoxha, Deputy Minister of Defense Arif Hasko, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the People's Army Kiciri Mero, leaders and soldier representatives of the Tirana Garrison of the People's Army, Second Secretary of the Foreign Ministry Musin Kroi, and worker representatives from various factories and enterprises in the capital.

Chinese Ambassador to Albania Li Tingyuan and Military Attaché Li Zhongxuan were also invited to attend the meeting.

The meeting hall was adorned with large portraits of Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people, and Comrade Enver Hoxha, the great leader of the Albanian people.

Deputy Minister of Defense Arif Hasko and Chinese Military Attaché to Albania Li Zhongxuan spoke at the meeting to enthusiastic applause.

Hasko, after recounting the glorious revolutionary and combat history of the Chinese People's Liberation Army over the past 41 years, emphasized that under the direct leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which is currently underway in China, has achieved decisive victories. This revolution, which has significant historical importance for China and the international communist and workers' movements, is a great struggle for the complete victory of socialism, communism, and Marxism-Leninism in China. It is a struggle to block the road to revisionism and eliminate the restoration of capitalism. It is a sharp struggle to overthrow and smash a handful of power-holders who are taking the capitalist road. For this reason, international imperialism led by the United States, the Khrushchev revisionists, and their followers are frantically opposing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. Because the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has shattered their vile plots against the heroic Chinese people. No tricks, no deceitful propaganda, and no interference, past, present, or future, can stop the victorious development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China.

He said, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has made and is making outstanding contributions of great importance in carrying out and further deepening the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, in opposing bourgeois and revisionist ideologies, in opposing anti-party elements, anti-socialist elements, and counter-revolutionaries, in defending the sacred and inviolable revolutionary victories of the Chinese people, and in perpetually advancing the great cause of revolution and socialism.

Hasko said, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, the soldiers and officers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are increasingly tempered in thought and politics, striving to strengthen preparedness and training, excellently mastering modern weapons and combat techniques, making the great People's Republic of China an impregnable fortress that no enemy can breach. Due to the genius and selfless labor of the soldiers and officers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the workers, and the technical personnel, the Chinese People's Liberation Army today possesses atomic bombs, hydrogen bombs, and missile weapons. This is a great victory for the fraternal Chinese people and for the people of all countries and all revolutionaries who are fighting for freedom and independence, against imperialism led by the U.S. and revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist renegade clique. The People's Republic of China has become the strongest bastion of socialism and a very powerful pillar of revolutionary and liberation struggles around the world. China is an insurmountable obstacle for imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries of all countries.

Hasko pointed out that the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, the iron-clad unity between the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the people, the unity among soldiers and cadres as class brothers and revolutionary comrades, the proletarian revolutionary class education and political stance, have been and are the foundation of all victories of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

He said, the great People's Republic of China is advancing with giant strides, achieving one victory after another. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the consolidation and strengthening of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the achievements in the economy, the rapid development of heavy industry and agriculture this year, the great scientific inventions that have shocked the world, are proof of these victories. The continuous strengthening of China's national defense forces and the continuous improvement of the Chinese People's Liberation Army also prove this.

Hasko said, due to the great creative labor and brilliant victories in the construction and defense of socialism, due to the correct and principled foreign policy and the resolute and courageous struggle against imperialism and Khrushchev revisionism, due to the active support and assistance given to the fraternal Vietnamese people in their sacred struggle against the U.S. aggressors, and to the people of all countries fighting for freedom and social progress, the great People's Republic of China has gained the great love and respect of the freedom-loving people of all countries. China's prestige has been enhanced and is continuing to be enhanced around the world. China is the decisive factor for peace and true security in Asia and the world. The U.S. imperialists and modern revisionists clearly know China's great power, clearly know that China is the main obstacle to their sinister plans to dominate the world and rule the people, therefore they try to "contain" and "encircle" China, to establish a so-called "ring of fire" around China, and so on. All the conspiracies and secret talks between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, as well as the provocations by India, Indonesia, and other reactionaries against the Chinese people, serve this purpose. But all their attempts have failed and will continue to fail like soap bubbles. They will lift the stone only to drop it on their own feet. The Chinese People's Liberation Army and the great Chinese people will always be vigilant, keep their powder dry, and will, as before, smash any provocations and invasion plots. U.S. planes and invaders who violate the sacred borders of the People's Republic of China have met with self-destruction. The same fate awaits those who dare to violate the sacred borders of the Chinese people and their socialist motherland in the future.

Hasko finally said, there exists a fraternal and sincere friendship between our two countries' peoples and armies, created by our two Marxist-Leninist parties and our outstanding leaders Comrade Enver Hoxha and Comrade Mao Zedong. This genuine friendship, based on Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, is continuously strengthening and consolidating.

Next, Li Zhongxuan pointed out in his speech that the Chinese People's Liberation Army is a military force personally created and nurtured by our great leader Chairman Mao to serve the Chinese people and the people of the world. The Chinese People's Liberation Army is absolutely loyal to the people, absolutely loyal to the Party, absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, absolutely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Over the past 41 years, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on people's war and people's army, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has fought bravely, making immortal contributions in the long struggle to liberate the motherland, to oppose imperialism and revisionism, in the socialist revolution and socialist construction; it is now undertaking the glorious tasks of "three supports, two militaries" in the great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, actively participating in the cultural revolution, undergoing the severe test of the mass movement, vigilantly defending the cultural revolution, and being ready at any time to smash any war provocations from any direction.

He said, the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Albanian People's Army are both true people's armies, both armed with Marxism-Leninism. We share the great task of opposing imperialism and revisionism and supporting the world revolution. We must support and learn from each other in our common struggle. The heroic Albanian People's Army has faithfully implemented the proletarian military line of the Albanian Party of Labor, actively responded to the call of the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labor and Comrade Enver Hoxha, raised the banner of revolution, and taken a series of major revolutionary measures, greatly promoting the ideological revolution of all soldiers and officers; it has also achieved great successes in military training, national defense construction, agricultural and sideline production, and militia work. This not only strongly promoted the construction of the Albanian People's Army in all aspects but also further consolidated the dictatorship of the proletariat in Albania. The Albanian People's Army is indeed a heroic army that is loyal to the Party, loyal to the people, loyal to the revolution, and has been tested in many battles. The Chinese People's Liberation Army is very happy and proud to have the Albanian People's Army as its close comrade-in-arms.

Li Zhongxuan finally said, the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, armed with Mao Zedong Thought and tempered by this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will surely hold high the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, more effectively support the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world, support the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, better fulfill our internationalist duties, and forever follow Chairman Mao's teachings, continuously strengthen the fighting friendship and unity with the heroic Albanian people and the Albanian People's Army.

The speeches of Hasko and Li Zhongxuan were repeatedly interrupted by the slogan "Enver-Mao."

After the celebration meeting, the film "The Tunnel War" was shown.

On the same day, some units of the Albanian People's Army also held meetings to celebrate the 41st anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

　　热烈庆祝中国人民解放军建军四十一周年
　　阿尔巴尼亚国防部隆重举行集会
    阿国防部副部长哈斯科盛赞中国人民解放军在无产阶级文化大革命中作出杰出贡献以及在反帝反修斗争中的强大堡垒作用
    我驻阿使馆武官李钟玄强调中阿两国军队在反帝反修、支援世界革命的共同斗争中互相支持、互相学习
    新华社地拉那三十一日电　阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国国防部三十日下午在地拉那“人民军之家”隆重举行集会，热烈庆祝中国人民解放军建军四十一周年。
    参加大会的有：阿尔巴尼亚人民军副总参谋长维赫比·霍查、国防部副部长阿里夫·哈斯科、人民军政治部副主任基奇里·梅罗、人民军地拉那卫戍部队的负责人和战士代表，外交部第二司长穆辛·克罗伊，首都各工厂企业的职工代表等。
    中国驻阿大使馆临时代办李庭荃和武官李钟玄也应邀出席了大会。
    会场上高悬着中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席和阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖霍查同志的巨幅画像。
    阿尔巴尼亚国防部副部长哈斯科和中国驻阿尔巴尼亚大使馆武官李钟玄在热烈的掌声中先后在大会上讲了话。
    哈斯科在叙述了中国人民解放军四十一年来光荣的革命的战斗历程后强调指出，在毛泽东主席的直接领导下中国开展的并正在深入进行的无产阶级文化大革命，现在已经取得了决定性的胜利。这场对中国以及国际共产主义运动和工人运动的命运具有重大历史意义的革命，是争取社会主义、共产主义和马克思列宁主义在中国彻底胜利的伟大斗争，是堵塞修正主义道路、根除资本主义复辟的斗争，是打倒和粉碎一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的尖锐斗争。正因为如此，以美国为首的国际帝国主义，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者及其追随者，疯狂地反对中国无产阶级文化大革命。因为中国无产阶级文化大革命粉碎了他们反对英雄的中国人民的卑鄙阴谋。任何诡计、任何蛊惑人心的宣传以及任何干涉，过去、现在和将来都不可能阻挡无产阶级文化大革命在中国的胜利发展。
    他说，中国人民解放军在开展和进一步深入进行无产阶级文化大革命，在反对资产阶级和修正主义思想，反对反党分子、反社会主义分子和反革命分子，保卫中国人民具有重大历史意义的神圣不可侵犯的胜利革命果实，以及把革命和社会主义的伟大事业永远推向前进等方面，已经和正在作出具有十分重要意义的杰出贡献。
    哈斯科说，在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，中国人民解放军指战员突出无产阶级政治，正在从思想上和政治上日益得到锻炼，努力地加强战备和训练，出色地掌握了现代化武器和战斗技术，使伟大的人民中国成为任何敌人都不能攻破的堡垒。由于中国人民解放军指战员、中国工人和技术人员的天才和忘我劳动，中国人民解放军今天已经拥有原子弹、氢弹和导弹武器。这是兄弟的中国人民，以及正在为争取自由和独立、反对以美帝为首的帝国主义者和以苏修叛徒集团为中心的修正主义者而斗争的世界各国人民和一切革命者的伟大胜利。中华人民共和国已经成为社会主义最强大的堡垒，成为世界各地革命和解放斗争的十分坚强有力的支柱。中国是帝国主义者、修正主义者和各国反动派不可逾越的障碍。
    哈斯科指出，中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导，中国人民解放军同人民钢铁般的紧密联系，战士和干部象阶级兄弟和革命同志一样的团结一致，无产阶级的革命的阶级教育和政治立场，过去和现在都是中国人民解放军一切胜利的基础。
    他说，伟大的人民中国正在以巨人般的步伐向前迈进，夺取一个又一个的胜利。无产阶级文化大革命，无产阶级专政的巩固和加强，经济方面的成就，今年重工业和农业的飞速发展，使全世界为之震惊的伟大科学发明，是这些胜利的证明。中国国防力量的不断加强和中国人民解放军的不断完善，也证明了这一点。
    哈斯科说，由于在建设和保卫社会主义中的巨大的创造性劳动和取得的辉煌胜利，由于正确的和原则性的对外政策及反对帝国主义、赫鲁晓夫修正主义所进行的坚决的和勇敢的斗争，由于给予兄弟的越南人民在反对美国强盗的神圣斗争中以积极的支持和援助，给予正在为争取自由和社会进步而斗争的各国人民积极的支持和援助，伟大的人民中国受到世界各国爱好自由的人民的极大爱戴和尊敬。中国的威望得到了提高，并且正在继续不断地在全世界得到提高。中国是亚洲和世界的和平与真正安全的决定性因素。美帝国主义者和现代修正主义者清楚地知道中国的伟大力量，清楚地知道中国是他们推行主宰世界和统治人民的阴险计划的主要障碍，因此他们力图“遏制”和“包围”中国，在中国的周围建立所谓“火力包围圈”等等。美苏所搞的一切阴谋勾结、公开的和秘密的会谈，以及印度、印尼和其它反动派对中国人民不断进行的挑衅行为，都是为这一目的服务的。但是他们的一切企图已经遭到破产，并必将继续象肥皂泡一样遭到破产。他们搬起石头必将砸在自己的脚上。中国人民解放军和伟大的中国人民不断地提高警惕，永远保持干燥的火药，将一如既往地粉碎任何挑衅和入侵的阴谋。侵犯中华人民共和国边境的美国飞机和侵略者已经遭到自取灭亡的命运。同样的命运正在等待着今后那些敢于侵犯中国人民及其社会主义祖国神圣边界的人。
    哈斯科最后说，我们两国兄弟人民和兄弟军队之间存在着由我们两个马克思列宁主义政党和我们的杰出领袖恩维尔·霍查同志和毛泽东同志缔造起来的兄弟的真诚的友谊。这种建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义基础上的真正友谊正在不断增强和巩固。
    接着，李钟玄在讲话中指出，中国人民解放军，是我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自缔造和培育的一支全心全意为中国人民和世界人民服务的军队。中国人民解放军无限忠于人民，无限忠于党，无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想和毛主席的革命路线。四十一年来，中国人民解放军在毛主席关于人民战争、人民军队的光辉思想的指引下，英勇奋斗，在解放祖国、反帝反修、社会主义革命和社会主义建设的长期斗争中，立下了不朽的功勋；现正在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中担负着“三支”、“两军”的光荣任务，积极地参加文化大革命，经受群众运动的严峻考验，警惕地捍卫着文化大革命，随时准备粉碎来自任何方面的战争挑衅。
    他说，中国人民解放军和阿尔巴尼亚人民军都是真正的人民的军队，都是以马克思列宁主义武装起来的军队。我们共同肩负着反帝反修、支援世界革命的伟大任务，我们要在共同的斗争中互相支持，互相学习。英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民军忠实地执行了阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的无产阶级建军路线，积极响应了阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会和霍查同志的号召，高举革命的大旗，采取了一系列重大的革命化措施，大大地促进了全体指战员的思想革命化；在军事训练、国防建设、农副业生产以及民兵工作方面也都取得了巨大的成绩。这不仅有力地推动了阿尔巴尼亚人民军各方面的建设，而且进一步巩固了阿尔巴尼亚的无产阶级专政。阿尔巴尼亚人民军不愧为一支忠于党、忠于人民、忠于革命、久经考验的英雄军队。中国人民解放军有阿尔巴尼亚人民军作为自己的亲密战友，感到无比高兴，无比自豪。
    李钟玄最后说，用毛泽东思想武装起来的、经过这场无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的中国人民和中国人民解放军，必将更高地举起马克思主义、列宁主义、毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更有效地支援全世界人民的革命斗争，支援亚非拉人民的反帝革命斗争，更好地完成我们的国际主义义务，并永远遵循毛主席的教导，不断加强同英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民和阿尔巴尼亚人民军的战斗友谊和团结。
    哈斯科和李钟玄的讲话不断被“恩维尔—毛泽东”的口号声所打断。
    庆祝大会结束以后，放映了中国影片《地道战》。
    同一天，阿尔巴尼亚人民军的一些部队也分别举行集会，庆祝中国人民解放军建军四十一周年。
