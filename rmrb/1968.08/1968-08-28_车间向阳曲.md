Workshop Song of Facing the Sun

Chairman Mao's latest instructions spread across the land,
The sky is clear and colorful clouds fly.
Workers rush to share the joyful news,
Tears of happiness stream down their faces.

In the workshop, a "Loyalty" meeting is held,
Under Chairman Mao's portrait, flowers bloom in smiles.
The old fitter rolls up his sleeves, revealing whip scars,
Tears of excitement stream down his face:

"We workers were once like horses and cattle,
Three mountains of burden pressed upon us.
Chairman Mao saved us from the pit of fire,
Chairman Mao is better than our own parents.
Remembering bitterness and sweetness, our hearts face the sun,
We workers must do our best!"

The foundry worker Little Li holds up the Little Red Book,
Standing before Chairman Mao's portrait, he speaks:

"Chairman Mao trusts us workers the most,
His latest instructions are our guiding light.
We must fight for Chairman Mao's cause,
The cultural revolution will bloom like a flower.
We vow to be the pillars of the revolution,
And uproot revisionism!"

The support worker Little Guo also expresses loyalty,
Though young, his heart is red and his spirit is great:

"Chairman Mao's wave sends me forward,
Through rivers and mountains, we march.
The tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation are on our shoulders,
We follow the commander's steps.
We must smash the 'multiple center' theory,
And with both hands, paint the character 'loyalty'."

The fighting workshop is swept by a storm,
Songs of loyalty resonate like the sea,
Loyalty is forged into an iron wall,
Victory blooms across the five continents!

    车间向阳曲
    红颂东毛主席最新指示传天下，万里晴空飞彩霞。工人们奔走喜相告，幸福的泪花脸上挂。车间里开起表“忠”会，毛主席像下笑开朵朵花。老钳工高挽袖子露鞭痕，激动的老泪簌簌下：
  “咱工人过去当马牛，三座大山身上压。毛主席救咱出火坑，毛主席胜过亲爹妈。忆苦思甜心向阳啊，咱工人阶级可要当好家！”翻砂工小李举宝书，站在毛主席像前把言发：
  “毛主席对咱工人最信任，最新指示是灯塔。咱要为毛主席把气争，教育革命开红花。誓作革命擎天柱，把修正主义连根挖！”支工战士小郭也表忠，人小心红志气大：
  “毛主席挥手我前进，万水千山走兵马。斗、批、改任务担在肩，紧跟统帅大步跨。彻底砸烂‘多中心论’，双手绘出‘忠’字画。”战斗的车间起风暴，歌声如海响哗哗，忠心铸成铁长城，五洲盛开胜利花！
