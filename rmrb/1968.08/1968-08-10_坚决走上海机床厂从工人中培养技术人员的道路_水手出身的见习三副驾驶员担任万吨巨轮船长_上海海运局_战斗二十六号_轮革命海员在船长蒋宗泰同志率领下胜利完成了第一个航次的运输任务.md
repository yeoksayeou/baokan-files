Shanghai Maritime Bureau’s "Battle 26" Ship's Revolutionary Sailors, Led by Captain Jiang Zongtai, Successfully Complete First Voyage

New China News Agency, Shanghai, August 8th - The revolutionary sailors of the "Battle 26" ship of the Shanghai Maritime Bureau, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "following the path of cultivating technical personnel from workers at the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory," have broken through old frameworks and foreign dogmas. A trainee third officer, originally a sailor, has taken command of a ten-thousand-ton giant ship. Recently, they successfully completed their first voyage. This is an unprecedented miracle in the history of world shipping.

In the past, the Shanghai Maritime Bureau had a sharp struggle over the issue of cultivating engineering and technical personnel. A handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party vigorously promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of China's Khrushchev, establishing a set of revisionist hierarchical and examination systems. They set up "examination barriers," "trainee barriers," "acting barriers," and "gradual promotion barriers based on ship tonnage," stifling the growth of worker technical personnel. Therefore, since the founding of New China, the Shanghai Maritime Bureau has cultivated and promoted very few workers to become ship captains.

During the great leap forward in 1958, Chairman Mao's good student, Ke Qing-shi, firmly implemented Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, cultivating a batch of technical personnel from the workers of the Shanghai Maritime Bureau. However, in 1962, the capitalist-roaders in the Shanghai Maritime Bureau, following the instructions of China's Khrushchev and his agents in Shanghai, Chen Pi-xian and Cao Di-qiu, created various excuses and dismissed over two hundred trainee officers and engineers who were originally sailors and stokers, while retaining the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries intact.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, revolutionary sailors thoroughly criticized China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, breaking through the unreasonable systems that controlled, restricted, and oppressed workers. Recently, they saw Chairman Mao's brilliant instructions on "following the path of cultivating technical personnel from workers at the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory," making their direction of advance even clearer. They said:

"Chairman Mao has spoken the words of our working class. Chairman Mao supports us, and we must make Chairman Mao proud." With the strong support of the People's Liberation Army's leftist cadres and the Shanghai Maritime Bureau's Revolutionary Committee, they decided to break through old frameworks and have Comrade Jiang Zongtai, a Communist Party member and trainee third officer originally a sailor, directly take command of the ten-thousand-ton ship. Jiang Zongtai, holding the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," excitedly said: "Chairman Mao instructs me to act, Chairman Mao waves his hand and I advance. We workers are the heroes of the Mao Zedong era. We dare to climb mountains of knives and leap into seas of fire. No difficulty can overwhelm us."

After Comrade Jiang Zongtai took command, he immediately began his first voyage. The revolutionary sailors of the "Battle 26" ship hung a plaque with Chairman Mao's quotations high on the bridge, using Chairman Mao's great teachings such as "in strategy, we must despise all enemies, in tactics, we must take all enemies seriously" and "resolutely determined, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, striving for victory" to encourage and inspire themselves. They combined revolutionary spirit with scientific attitude, pooled their wisdom, and carefully studied the problems that might be encountered during the voyage. All revolutionary sailors, with the attitude of masters of the state, were very concerned about sailing the ship well. Everyone had one heart and one mind, thinking about how to load more and run faster, creating more wealth for the state. During this voyage from Shanghai to Qingdao, they encountered fog, but they did not anchor. Instead, they strengthened their lookout and continued to advance. To save expenses, they did not request a pilot when entering Qingdao Port but moored the ship themselves, both steadily and well. Finally, they successfully completed their first voyage.

The revolutionary practice of the "Battle 26" ship declared the complete failure of China's Khrushchev's revisionist line of relying on bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities" in shipping. It powerfully proved the absolute correctness of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. At the same time, it strongly proved that Chairman Mao's great truth, "the lowly are the wisest, the noble are the most foolish," is absolutely correct.

　　坚决走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路
　　水手出身的见习三副驾驶员担任万吨巨轮船长
    上海海运局“战斗二十六号”轮革命海员在船长蒋宗泰同志率领下胜利完成了第一个航次的运输任务
    新华社上海八日电  上海海运局“战斗二十六号”轮的革命海员，在毛主席关于“走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路”的最新指示光辉指引下，大破旧框框、洋教条，直接由水手出身的见习三副驾驶员担任万吨巨轮的船长，最近胜利地完成了第一个航次的运输任务。这是世界航运史上从来没有的奇迹。
    过去，上海海运局在培养工程技术人员的问题上，一直存在着尖锐激烈的两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争。党内一小撮走资派竭力推行中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，制定了一整套修正主义的等级制度和考试制度。他们设置了“考试关”、“见习关”、“代理关”、“船舶吨位逐级晋升关”等关卡，扼杀工人技术人员的成长。因此，新中国建立以来，上海海运局从工人中培养、提拔当船长的寥寥无几。
    在一九五八年轰轰烈烈的大跃进中，毛主席的好学生柯庆施同志坚决贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，从上海海运局的工人中培养了一批技术人员。但是一九六二年，上海海运局的走资派秉承中国赫鲁晓夫及其在上海代理人陈丕显、曹荻秋的意旨，制造种种借口，把船上两百多名水手、生火工出身的见习驾驶员、轮机员统统砍掉，而对于国民党反动派的残渣余孽却是原封不动地包了下来。
    无产阶级文化大革命运动中，广大革命海员狠狠批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，打破了管、卡、压工人的不合理的制度。最近他们又看到了伟大领袖毛主席关于“走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路”的光辉指示，更加明确了前进的方向。他们说：
  “毛主席说出了我们工人阶级的心里话。毛主席给我们撑腰，我们一定要为毛主席争气。”在人民解放军支左人员和上海海运局革委会的大力支持下，决定打破旧框框，由共产党员、水手出身的见习三副驾驶员蒋宗泰同志直接担任万吨轮船的船长。蒋宗泰手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》激动地说：“毛主席指示我照办，毛主席挥手我前进。我们工人是毛泽东时代的英雄好汉，我们刀山敢上，火海敢闯，什么困难也不能压倒我们。”
    蒋宗泰同志担任船长后随即开始了第一次航程。“战斗二十六号”轮的革命海员们把毛主席语录牌高高地挂在驾驶台上，用毛主席关于“在战略上我们要藐视一切敌人，在战术上我们要重视一切敌人”和“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”等伟大教导，勉励自己，鼓舞自己。他们把革命精神和科学态度结合起来，群策群力，认真研究了航行中可能遇到的问题。全体革命海员都以国家主人翁态度十分关心开好船，大家一个心眼想着怎样多装快跑，为国家创造更多的财富。这次从上海到青岛途中，遇到了雾，他们没有抛锚，一边加强了望，一边继续前进。为了节省费用，他们进青岛港也不请领港，自己靠上码头，又稳又好，终于胜利地完成了第一个航次的运输任务。
    “战斗二十六号”轮的革命实践，宣告了中国赫鲁晓夫在海运方面所推行的依靠资产阶级反动技术“权威”航海的修正主义路线的彻底破产，雄辩地证明了毛主席最新指示的无比英明、无比正确。同时，也有力地证明了伟大领袖毛主席指出的“卑贱者最聪明！高贵者最愚蠢”，是千真万确的伟大真理。
