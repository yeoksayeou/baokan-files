An Anhui Revolutionary Committee's Women's Committee Members Play a Significant Role

Through class struggle and practical work, a large number of outstanding female committee members have rapidly grown. They are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, take Jiang Qing as their example, stand at the forefront of class struggle, and fight for the implementation and defense of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line for life.

The People's Daily reports: The revolutionary committees at all levels in Anhui Province have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. With the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, they have severely criticized the revisionist fallacies on women's issues spread by the Chinese Khrushchev. They have eliminated the old ideas and habits of the exploiting classes that have been prevalent for thousands of years, which despise women. They have absorbed the outstanding representatives of revolutionary women who have emerged during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution into the revolutionary committees at all levels. They have also paid attention to fully utilizing their roles. After these female committee members entered the revolutionary committees at all levels, they demonstrated their abilities and achieved great success, winning the praise of the broad revolutionary masses. People praised them as "the female heads of the proletariat."

Seriously Study Chairman Mao's Instructions on Women's Issues

Severely Criticize the Chinese Khrushchev's Fallacies on Women's Issues

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Women make up half of the population. The economic position of laboring women and their particularly oppressed status not only prove the urgent need for women in the revolution but also are a decisive force in determining the victory or defeat of the revolution." During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of revolutionary women, just like their male comrades, responded to Chairman Mao's great call. They raised high the revolutionary banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries" and bravely joined the revolutionary torrent. They fought bravely and tenaciously. In the fierce struggle against the bourgeois reactionary line, in the great struggle to seize power from the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, and in the great exposure and criticism of the counterrevolutionary revisionism of the Chinese Khrushchev, they established immortal merits. They grew and emerged as a large number of outstanding representatives in the storms and waves of class struggle. When the revolutionary committees were being established in various places, the Anhui Provincial Revolutionary Committee timely proposed to absorb outstanding revolutionary women representatives who have prestige and are closely connected with the masses into the revolutionary committees at all levels, allowing them to hold power for the proletariat. The opinion of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee was warmly supported by the broad revolutionary masses. However, due to the revisionist fallacies on women's issues spread by the Chinese Khrushchev and the old ideas at work, some obstacles were also encountered. Some people said, "Women cannot handle big things." Others said, "Women can fight for the country, but they cannot govern the country." Still, others said, "Selecting a few to take care of them is also acceptable," and so on.

With the help of the support-left teams, the broad revolutionary masses in various places seriously studied Chairman Mao's great teachings: "Unite and participate in production and political activities to improve the economic and political status of women." They studied the relevant instructions of the proletarian headquarters with Chairman Mao as the leader and Vice Chairman Lin as the deputy. They extensively publicized the heroic deeds of revolutionary women in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution who fought to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Everyone criticized the saying of "selecting a few to take care of them" and "women can fight for the country, but they cannot govern the country," pointing out that this is to belittle revolutionary women and lower their status, which is completely wrong. They believed that whether or not to correctly treat revolutionary women is related to whether or not to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, whether or not to strengthen and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, and it is a major issue of whether or not to be loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The revolutionary masses in some factories and hospitals in Fuyang Region said: During the revolution, female comrades fought side by side with male comrades. Now that power has been seized, there is no share for female comrades. This is the remnant of feudal ideology at work; unless the dust of the exploiting classes that despise women is thoroughly swept away from one's mind, one cannot correctly treat revolutionary women and be a thorough revolutionary. The broad revolutionary masses realized: Women make up half of the population and are an important force in the socialist revolution and socialist construction. Female comrades participating in the revolutionary committees is a necessity of the times, a necessity of the revolution, and a necessity of the new revolutionary regime. Their participation in the revolutionary committees makes the representativeness of the new revolutionary regime even broader.

Many units carried out revolutionary criticism around the issue of revolutionary women representatives entering the revolutionary committees. The Chinese Khrushchev used the bourgeois so-called "women's viewpoint" to cover up the class struggle essence of the women's movement. He opposed women's revolution, opposed women taking the socialist road, and absurdly said that "the central task of women's work is also production," and the purpose of production is for "clothing and food for the family," and so on. The broad revolutionary masses severely criticized these reactionary fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev, thus deeply realizing that women's issues are always connected with political revolution. Without the proletariat's struggle against the bourgeoisie, without the struggle to seize power and consolidate power, one cannot talk about the women's movement at all. The Chinese Khrushchev's attempt to confine women within the small circle of the family is absolutely impossible. They said: Revolutionary women representatives participating in the revolutionary committees is a powerful blow to the Chinese Khrushchev's attempt to suppress women from revolutionizing, which is a bourgeois reactionary line.

Through repeated study and the launch of revolutionary criticism, Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line has deeply entered people's hearts. In the establishment of revolutionary committees in various places, attention was paid to absorbing outstanding female comrades into the revolutionary committees. In the revolutionary committees established throughout the province, the vast majority have female comrades. Many units' revolutionary committee chairpersons and vice-chairpersons are held by female comrades, and there are even more female committee members. In Chao Lake Special District, from the special district to the commune level, female committee members account for more than 10% in various levels of revolutionary committees. In some revolutionary committees, female committee members account for more than 20%. In Changfeng County Revolutionary Committee, there are 43 committee members, 9 of whom are female committee members.

The Revolutionary Committees at All Levels Attach Importance to Utilizing the Roles of Female Committee Members

The Broad Masses of Female Committee Members Have Made Great Contributions in Their Work

The revolutionary committees at all levels in Anhui Province have paid great attention to utilizing the roles of female committee members, daring to use them, caring for and guiding them, and cultivating and improving them. Many revolutionary committees specially held Mao Zedong Thought study classes, enthusiastically helping female committee members to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, promoting their ideological revolutionization. The revolutionary committees in various places paid attention to letting female committee members go to the frontline of class struggle, to the most difficult and complex places, so that they could continuously improve their awareness of class struggle and two-line struggle and their actual work abilities in class struggle. For example, when the Provincial Revolutionary Committee organized Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to go to Anqing, Fuyang, Suzhou, Lu'an, and Chuzhou to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, investigate and study, and handle problems, female committee members participated and fully played their roles in actual work, letting them grow and be tempered in the storms and waves of class struggle. Many revolutionary committees also arranged for female committee members to be on duty, letting them preside over meetings, cultivating their independent work abilities. For example, when Changfeng County conveyed the spirit of the first plenary session of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee, the county revolutionary committee arranged for the 19-year-old female vice-chairperson Shu Shiyun to convey the spirit. As a result, she conveyed it very well and was praised by the broad revolutionary masses. Many revolutionary committees, when distributing work tasks, adopted the method of "old leading new," organizing old comrades and young female committee members to carry out "one helping one" and "one red pair" activities, learning from each other's strengths and weaknesses, and improving together.

A large number of outstanding revolutionary women representatives entering the revolutionary committees at all levels have fully demonstrated their abilities and played their due roles. Zhang Xiuying, a female worker from Anhui Textile Factory, and Zhang Jia Yun, a female commune member from Shouxian County, after assuming the position of vice-chairpersons of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee, actively participated in the duty of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee, seriously and responsibly handled problems, or presided over relevant meetings; when they returned to their original production posts, they grasped revolution and promoted production with the masses, always maintaining the character of the working people. Our great leader Chairman Mao has received many times the national labor model, Provincial Revolutionary Committee Standing Committee member Long Donghua, participated in the plenary session of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee, and discussed national affairs with other committee members. When she returned to the commune, she actively implemented the spirit of the plenary session of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee. Wherever there was a problem, she went there. In a production brigade, the revolutionary big-character posters were not well done, so she went there with the brigade cadres to study Chairman Mao's teachings, discuss the great significance of revolutionary big-character posters, set up a revolutionary big-character poster column, and launched a wave of revolutionary big-character posters. Before the commune achieved revolutionary great unity, she went deep into the two revolutionary mass organizations, using Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions to help them fight against selfishness and repudiate revisionism, quickly achieving revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination. The other day, she took the lead in going to the frontline of flood prevention. Wherever there was danger, she went there, and with the broad cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants, she shared weal and woe, fought day and night, and did a good job in flood prevention work. The masses reflected: Long Donghua has been back from the province for a short time but has done many good things. Such female committee members are really capable! A young female teacher from Dongfanghong Primary School in Hefei, Jiang Huiying, was recommended by the broad revolutionary masses to be a committee member, vice-chairperson, and chairperson of the Hefei City, Xishi District, and Dongfanghong Primary School Revolutionary Committees. In addition to actively completing the work tasks of the city and district revolutionary committees, she has always been rooted in the grassroots, and with the school revolutionary committee members, led the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of the entire school to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, grasp class struggle, and carry out revolutionary big-character posters in depth and for a long time. The spiritual face of the entire school's teachers, students, and staff has been renewed, and the resumption of classes and making revolution has been carried out vigorously and solidly. Jiang Huiying, in leading the school revolutionary committee's work, truly played the role of a "team leader," building the new revolutionary committee into a command center that leads the masses to fight. She deeply felt: "As long as we follow Chairman Mao, study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, dare to make revolution, and dare to struggle, the things that male comrades can do, we female comrades can also do."

In the struggle against the enemy, the broad female committee members showed great determination and courage, clear hatred and love, and a firm stand. Provincial Revolutionary Committee Standing Committee members Wang Youxiang and Xu Yan led the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, going wherever there were difficulties and going wherever the situation was complex. When Wang Youxiang comrade propagated Mao Zedong Thought in Dingyuan and Jiashan regions, she went deep into reality, connected with the masses, held high the banner, and dared to take responsibility, winning the praise of the masses. When Xu Yan comrade propagated Mao Zedong Thought in Anqing City, a small number of people deceived by bad elements attacked the propaganda team, and she stood out, propagating Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's policies to the masses, exposing the enemy's plot to sabotage revolutionary great unity. Afterwards, she went deep into the grassroots, had heart-to-heart talks with the masses, and did a lot of political and ideological work, learning about many situations. Many comrades praised her: "This female general is unyielding in the complex class struggle and is really great!" Liu Xian, a female committee member of Liuxi Commune Revolutionary Committee in Lixin County, firmly remembered Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forget class struggle," and with the poor and lower-middle peasants, exposed a fake village head who sabotaged production, and carried out many struggles, greatly improving the masses' class consciousness, and mobilizing the enthusiasm of the broad masses to grasp revolution and promote production. During the summer grain procurement, a handful of class enemies again sabotaged, saying that "it is nothing if the task is not completed." Liu Xian went to nine production teams, organizing commune members to study Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle, carrying out activities to recall bitterness and think of sweetness, making the broad commune members timely see through the enemy's plot, correctly handle the relationship between the state, collective, and individual, and all nine production teams exceeded the summer grain procurement task.

A large number of outstanding female committee members followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "being an official and also a common person," rooted among the masses, and became the bridge connecting the revolutionary committees with the masses. The female committee members of Anhui Textile Factory and its various branch factories reflected the criticism of the broad workers on the factory's overlapping and bloated institutions. The factory revolutionary committee immediately mobilized the masses to severely criticize the counterrevolutionary revisionist line that the Chinese Khrushchev promoted in the construction of political power, and carried out the trial of "streamlining administration" in the knitting factory, reducing the original 134 administrative cadres of the factory to 32, and the rest of the personnel formed Mao Zedong Thought study classes, going to the workshops, groups, and working with the workers to study, labor, and fight. Female commune member Liu Fengyun, after assuming the position of a committee member of Jinzhai County Revolutionary Committee, has always insisted on participating in collective labor and maintaining close contact with the poor and lower-middle peasants. She brought the problems existing in her production team to set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and with the commune members, fought against selfishness and repudiated revisionism, improving the class consciousness of the commune members, and making revolution and production hot and lively.

A large number of outstanding female committee members have rapidly grown through class struggle and practical work. Their class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness have been improved, and their ability to manage state affairs has also been improved. Female committee members have shown great roles, had a profound impact on society, and changed many people's wrong views of despising women. Female committee members themselves also deeply felt: Only by following Chairman Mao to make revolution and carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end can women be thoroughly liberated politically. They are determined to take Jiang Qing as their example, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, stand at the forefront of class struggle, always maintain a vigorous revolutionary spirit, and fight for the implementation and defense of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line for life.

    以毛泽东思想为武器，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫在妇女问题上散布的修正主义谬论
    安徽各级革委会妇女委员发挥巨大作用
    通过阶级斗争和实际工作锻炼，大批优秀女委员迅速成长起来。她们决心高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以江青同志为榜样，站在阶级斗争最前列，为坚决执行、勇敢捍卫毛主席的革命路线而战斗终生
    本报讯　安徽省各级革命委员会，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫在妇女问题上散布的修正主义谬论，清除千百年来剥削阶级轻视妇女的旧思想、旧习惯，把在无产阶级文化大革命中涌现出来的革命妇女的优秀代表人物，吸收到各级革命委员会中来，并且注意充分发挥她们的作用。这些女委员进入各级革委会以后，显示了她们的才干，做出了很大的成绩，受到广大革命群众的赞扬。人们称赞她们是“无产阶级的女当家”。
  认真学习毛主席关于妇女问题的教导
    狠批中国赫鲁晓夫对妇女问题的谬论
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“妇女占人口的半数，劳动妇女在经济上的地位和她们特别受压迫的状况，不但证明妇女对革命的迫切需要，而且是决定革命胜败的一个力量”。在无产阶级文化大革命中，广大的革命妇女和男同志一样，响应毛主席的伟大号召，高举
  “对反动派造反有理”的革命大旗，英姿飒爽地冲杀出来，投入了革命的激流。她们勇敢战斗，顽强不屈，在对资产阶级反动路线的激烈搏斗中，在向党内一小撮走资派夺权的伟大斗争中，在对中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义的大揭露、大批判中，建立了不朽的功勋。她们在阶级斗争的大风大浪中锻炼成长起来，并且涌现出一大批优秀的代表人物。在各地筹建革委会的时候，安徽省革命委员会适时地提出，要把有威信的、同群众有密切联系的优秀的革命妇女代表吸收到各级革命委员会中来，让她们为无产阶级掌权。省革命委员会的意见，受到广大革命群众的热烈拥护。但是，由于中国赫鲁晓夫在妇女问题上散布的修正主义谬论和旧思想作怪，也遇到了一些阻力。有的人说：“妇女干不了什么大事。”有的说：“妇女能打天下，不能管天下。”还有人说：“选两个照顾照顾她们也可以。”等等。
    各地广大革命群众在支左部队的帮助下，认真学习毛主席的伟大教导：“团结起来，参加生产和政治活动，改善妇女的经济地位和政治地位。”学习以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的有关指示，大摆革命妇女在无产阶级文化大革命中为捍卫毛主席的革命路线而冲锋陷阵的英雄事迹。大家批判了那种“选两个照顾照顾”以及“妇女能打天下，不能管天下”的说法，指出这是轻视革命妇女，贬低革命妇女的地位，是完全错误的。他们认为，能否正确对待革命妇女，是关系到能不能夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的问题，是能不能加强和巩固无产阶级专政的问题，是一个忠不忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的大问题。阜阳地区的一些工厂、医院的广大革命群众说：革命的时候，女同志和男同志并肩战斗，现在掌权了，没有女同志的份，这是封建残余思想在作怪；不彻底扫除头脑里的剥削阶级轻视妇女的灰尘，就不能正确对待革命妇女，就不是彻底的革命派。广大革命群众认识到：妇女占人口的半数，是社会主义革命和社会主义建设的重要力量，女同志参加革命委员会是时代的需要，是革命的需要，是革命新政权的需要。她们参加革命委员会，新生的革命政权代表性就更加广泛了。
    不少单位围绕着革命妇女代表进入革命委员会的问题，开展了革命大批判。中国赫鲁晓夫用资产阶级的所谓“妇女观点”，掩盖妇女运动阶级斗争的实质。他不准妇女革命，反对妇女走社会主义道路，胡说什么“妇女工作的中心任务也是生产”，生产的目的是为“家庭的丰衣足食”，等等。广大革命群众狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的这些反动谬论，从而深刻地认识到，妇女问题总是同政治革命连在一起的。离开了无产阶级对资产阶级的斗争，离开了夺取政权、巩固政权的斗争，就根本谈不上妇女运动。中国赫鲁晓夫妄图把妇女限制在家庭的小圈子里，是万万办不到的。他们说：革命妇女代表参加革命委员会，是对中国赫鲁晓夫妄图压制妇女起来革命的资产阶级反动路线的最有力打击。
    通过反复学习和开展革命大批判，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线深入人心。各地在筹建革委会中，都注意把优秀的女同志吸收到革委会中来。全省已建立的各级革委会中，绝大多数都有女同志，不少单位的革委会主任和副主任是女同志担任，女委员就更多了。巢湖专区从专区到公社的各级革委会中，女委员占百分之十以上。有的革委会中，女委员占百分之二十以上。长丰县革委会四十三名委员中，有九名女委员。
  各级革委会重视发挥妇女委员的作用
    广大妇女委员在工作中做出重大贡献
    安徽省各级革委会，都很重视发挥女委员的作用，大胆使用她们，关心指导她们，培养提高她们。许多革委会专门举办毛泽东思想学习班，热情地帮助女委员活学活用毛泽东思想，促进她们的思想革命化。各地革委会都注意放手让女委员到阶级斗争第一线去，到最艰苦、斗争最复杂的地方去，使她们在阶级斗争中不断提高两条路线斗争觉悟和实际工作能力。如省革命委员会在组织毛泽东思想宣传队到安庆、阜阳、宿县、六安、滁县等地宣传毛泽东思想，调查研究和处理问题时，都有女委员参加，在实际工作中充分发挥她们的作用，让她们在阶级斗争的大风大浪中锻炼成长。许多革委会还安排女委员值班，让她们主持会议，培养她们的独立工作能力。例如，长丰县在传达省革委会第一次全体会议精神时，县革委会就安排十九岁的女副主任舒世云出面传达。结果，她传达得很好，受到广大革命群众的赞扬。许多革委会在分配工作任务时，采取以老带新的办法，组织老同志和年青的女委员开展“一帮一”、“一对红”的活动，互相取长补短，共同提高。
    大批优秀的革命妇女代表进入各级革委会，充分显示了她们的才能，发挥了应有的作用。安徽纺织厂女工张秀英、寿县女社员张家云，担任省革委会副主任以后，积极参加省革委会值班，认真负责处理问题，或主持有关会议；回到原生产岗位，就和群众一起抓革命，促生产，始终保持劳动人民的本色。我们伟大领袖毛主席多次接见的全国劳动模范、省革委会常委龙冬花，参加省革委会全会，和其他委员共同讨论国家大事，回到公社就积极贯彻省革委会全会精神。哪里有问题，她就到哪里去。有个大队，革命大批判没有很好地搞起来，她就去和大队干部一起学习毛主席的教导，讨论革命大批判的伟大意义，办起了大批判专栏，掀起了革命大批判的热潮。公社实现革命大联合以前，她深入到两派革命群众组织中去，用毛主席一系列最新指示帮助他们斗私批修，很快实现了革命的大联合和革命的三结合。前些天，她又带头深入防汛第一线，哪里有险情，就到哪里去，和广大干部、贫下中农同甘共苦，日夜战斗，把防汛工作抓得很好。群众反映说：龙冬花从省里回来时间不长，却办了很多好事。这样的女委员，真能干！合肥市东方红小学青年女教师詹惠英，先后被广大革命群众推荐为合肥市、西市区和东方红小学革命委员会的委员、副主任和主任。她除积极完成市、区革委会的工作任务外，始终扎根于基层，和学校革委会成员一起，带领全校革命的师生员工紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，大办毛泽东思想学习班，狠抓阶级斗争，深入持久地开展革命大批判，全校师生员工精神面貌焕然一新，复课闹革命搞得轰轰烈烈，扎扎实实。詹惠英在领导校革委会工作中，真正起到了“班长”的作用，把新生的革委会建设成为带领群众战斗的指挥部。她深有体会地说：“只要紧跟毛主席，活学活用毛泽东思想，敢于革命，敢于斗争，男同志能办到的事情，我们女同志也照样可以办到。”
    广大女委员在对敌斗争中，表现得很坚决，很勇敢，爱憎分明，立场坚定。省革委会常委王有香、许燕，带领毛泽东思想宣传队，哪里有困难就到哪里去，哪里情况复杂就到哪里去。王有香同志在定远、嘉山地区宣传毛泽东思想时，深入实际，联系群众，旗帜鲜明，勇于负责，受到群众的好评。许燕同志在安庆市宣传毛泽东思想时，少数受坏人蒙蔽的群众围攻宣传队，她挺身而出，向群众宣传毛泽东思想和党的政策，揭露阶级敌人破坏革命大联合的阴谋。事后，又深入基层，和群众谈心交朋友，做了大量的政治思想工作，了解了很多情况。不少同志称赞她说：“这个女闯将在复杂的阶级斗争中始终不转向，真是好样的。”利辛县柳西公社革委会常委于友兰牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，和贫下中农一起，揪出了一个破坏生产的伪保长，进行了多次批斗，大大提高了群众的阶级觉悟，调动了广大群众抓革命促生产的积极性。夏粮征购时，一小撮阶级敌人又进行破坏，胡说什么“完不成任务没有啥”。于友兰先后到九个生产队，组织社员学习毛主席有关阶级斗争的教导，开展忆苦思甜活动，使广大社员及时识破了阶级敌人的阴谋，正确处理了国家、集体、个人三者之间的关系，九个生产队都超额完成了夏粮征购任务。
    大批优秀的女委员遵照毛主席“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”的教导，扎根于群众之中，和群众打成一片，成为革委会联系群众的桥梁。安徽纺织总厂和各分厂革委会的女委员们，反映了广大工人对厂里机构重叠、臃肿的批评意见。总厂革委会立即发动群众，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面所推行的反革命修正主义路线，并在针织厂进行“精兵简政”的试点，把这个厂原来的一百三十四个行政干部，精简到三十二人，其余人员组成毛泽东思想学习班，到车间、班组和工人一起学习、劳动、战斗。女社员刘凤云担任金寨县革委会委员以后，一直坚持参加集体劳动，与贫下中农保持密切联系。她带着本生产队存在的问题，大办毛泽东思想学习班，和社员们一起斗私批修，提高了社员的阶级觉悟，把革命、生产搞得热气腾腾。
    大批优秀的女委员通过阶级斗争和实际工作的锻炼，迅速成长起来。她们的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟提高了，管理国家大事的能力也提高了。女委员们显示出巨大的作用，对社会发生了深远的影响，使许多人改变了轻视妇女的错误看法。妇女委员自己也深刻地体会到：只有紧跟毛主席闹革命，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，妇女才能在政治上得到彻底解放。她们决心以江青同志为榜样，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，站在阶级斗争的最前列，永远保持朝气蓬勃的革命精神，为坚决执行、勇敢捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线而战斗终生。
