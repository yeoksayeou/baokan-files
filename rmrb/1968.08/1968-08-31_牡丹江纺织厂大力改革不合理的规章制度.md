The great leader Chairman Mao recently instructed us: “Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully bring into play the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in all work. The working class should also continuously raise its political consciousness in the struggle.”

The Mudanjiang Textile Factory Revolutionary Committee, following Chairman Mao’s teachings, after implementing the policy of streamlining administration and reducing personnel, relied closely on the working class, promptly discovered and resolved contradictions, and carried out a series of reforms in leadership style, rules and regulations, and management organization. This consolidated the achievements of streamlining administration and reducing personnel and better brought into play the leading role of the working class.

After implementing the policy of streamlining administration and reducing personnel, this factory realized the wish of having a small leading cadre team and fewer administrative personnel. However, with the reduction in personnel, some new contradictions emerged: from the standing committee members to the general staff, everyone felt very busy, and work became chaotic, leading to a situation where leading cadres rarely went to the workshops, had little contact with the workers, and participated less in production labor.

After streamlining administration and reducing personnel, what should be done? This question was sharply posed before the Revolutionary Committee. With the help of the People’s Liberation Army propaganda team stationed in the factory, the factory Revolutionary Committee reviewed and summarized the lessons from previous instances of streamlining administration and reducing personnel, realizing that they were at a critical juncture: either continue to resolve new contradictions and persist with the policy of streamlining administration and reducing personnel, or retreat in the face of the resistance of old habits and gradually revert to old practices. The Revolutionary Committee recognized this as a struggle between two lines, with no room for compromise. Therefore, they relied on the working class to engage in a head-on struggle against the old forces of the exploiting classes, actively resolving various new contradictions that emerged after streamlining.

Relying on the Working Class, Overcoming All Difficulties

With the help of the People’s Liberation Army propaganda team stationed in the factory, the Revolutionary Committee first organized a heated discussion around the question of “What is the fundamental difference between new organizations and old organizations?” During the discussion, they repeatedly studied Chairman Mao’s teachings: “What distinguishes our Communist Party from all other political parties is that we have the closest ties with the broadest masses of the people.” “The most fundamental point in the reform of state organs is to link up with the masses.” At the same time, they severely criticized the heinous crimes of China’s Khrushchev and his agents in the factory who rode roughshod over the people and acted like officials and lords. Through study and criticism, everyone unanimously recognized that whether to link up with the masses or to detach from them, whether to rely on the workers or to rule over them, is the fundamental difference between revolutionary new organizations and old organizations, and is the main indicator of whether the Revolutionary Committee has broken out of the old organizational framework. As the workers said: “No matter how much you streamline, if the cadres still sit in the office all day and do not go to the masses, then they have not broken out of the old organizational framework.”

The members of the Revolutionary Committee unanimously agreed that to resolve the new contradictions that emerged after streamlining administration and reducing personnel, they must start with thoroughly revolutionizing the leadership’s ideology and establishing a style of close ties with the masses. The Revolutionary Committee decided: (1) Except for two people on duty each day, all standing committee members must leave the office and go to the workers, implementing joint study, joint labor, and joint struggle with the workers. (2) The staff of the Revolutionary Committee must have half of their number go to the workshops and work teams each day. (3) Maintain the system of cadres participating in collective production labor, with no less than two days per week and four months per year.

After the members of the Revolutionary Committee went down to the workshops, they found the work to be overwhelming. They first made it their most important and fundamental task to propagate Mao Zedong Thought among the workers and implement the orders of the proletarian headquarters. Recently, the standing committee members went to the workshops to propagate Chairman Mao’s latest instructions, using Mao Zedong Thought to mobilize the workers and jointly struggle with them, timely exposing the various plots of the class enemies and smashing the sabotage activities of a small handful of class enemies. Some standing committee members went to the spinning workshop and found that many machines were stopped. After investigation, the main reason was a shortage of personnel. They personally went to the weaving workshop, which had surplus personnel, to propagate Chairman Mao’s teaching of “emphasizing the overall situation,” and the broad masses of workers enthusiastically responded, transferring 36 people to solve the problem in the spinning workshop. During the hottest days, the workers urgently needed refreshments. After hearing the workers’ feedback, the members of the factory Revolutionary Committee immediately found the logistics personnel to study Chairman Mao’s teaching of “we should pay deep attention to the problems of the people’s livelihood,” supervising the relevant departments to promptly deliver the refreshments to the workshops. The workers were delighted to see the new style of the Revolutionary Committee members, praising: “Now, wherever there are masses, there are cadres; wherever there are problems, there is leadership to solve them. The members of the Revolutionary Committee listen to Chairman Mao’s words, break out of the old organizational framework, and are with us workers.” Because the members of the Revolutionary Committee went to the front lines, many problems were solved by the workers on the spot, making the leadership work more proactive. They deeply felt: “Linking up with the masses is like a fish in water; detaching from the masses is like a tree without roots. Relying closely on the working class, all difficulties can be overcome.”

Fully Mobilizing the Masses, Reforming Unreasonable Rules and Regulations That Bind the Workers

At the beginning of establishing a new revolutionary style of close ties with the masses, there was considerable resistance among the cadres, with many saying: “The work is busy, and we can’t go down.” The Revolutionary Committee analyzed this, believing that there were both ideological and practical issues. After streamlining administration and reducing personnel, one person did the work of several people in the past, but the business procedures were still as cumbersome as before, to a certain extent still relying on a few cadres to “manage” the workers with rules and regulations, thus creating a sharp contradiction between the new organizations and new styles and the old unreasonable rules and regulations. What should be done? The Revolutionary Committee believed that only by thoroughly reforming the old unreasonable rules and regulations could the broad cadres jump out of the business pile, and only then could the workers’ enthusiasm and initiative be fully brought into play, participating in the leadership of the enterprise. They decided to fully mobilize the masses to reform the old unreasonable rules and regulations.

“Current conditions and habits often bind people’s minds tightly.” Some cadres had long executed the old unreasonable rules and regulations, and their minds had formed a solid framework. They emphasized that one rule involved higher authorities, and they couldn’t change it unless the higher authorities did; another rule involved other departments, and they couldn’t change it unless others did; if others changed, they criticized it as “unscientific” or “not strict enough.”

These situations showed that if the revisionist enterprise management system was not thoroughly criticized, many cadres could not break out of the old business framework, and the reforms could not be carried out. The Revolutionary Committee organized the broad cadres and workers, using Chairman Mao’s latest instructions as a weapon, launching a revolutionary big criticism of the revisionist line of managing enterprises and the old unreasonable rules and regulations. The broad masses deeply exposed the crimes of a small handful of capitalist roaders in the factory who opposed Chairman Mao’s personally formulated proletarian revolutionary line for achieving industrialization in our country, desperately pushing the revisionist line of China’s Khrushchev. These capitalist roaders, following the path of their masters, from the work teams to the factory, from production operations to female workers sending milk to their children, all set one rule after another, binding the workers’ hands and feet tightly. Workers described the difficulty of doing things in the past: “Praying to the mountain god, worshipping the earth god, signing and approving countless passes, pushing each other, and shifting responsibility without taking responsibility.” The broad revolutionary masses concentrated their criticism on the four crimes of the old cumbersome rules and regulations: (1) Tying up cadres, making them unable to leave the office and unable to unite with the workers; (2) Intimidating workers, not allowing workers to participate in management; (3) Binding the masses’ initiative, hindering production development; (4) Business first, “control” first, not emphasizing proletarian politics. The more they criticized, the more deeply they realized that this cumbersome set of rules and regulations was purely serving the revisionist line of “experts managing the factory,” serving the bourgeois dictatorship, serving the capitalist roaders to be officials and lords. The working class did not need this, and it must be thoroughly smashed. At the same time, the broad masses also criticized the slave mentality of worshipping the revisionist enterprise management system and the crawling mentality of not daring to think and not daring to act. The revolutionary big criticism led by the workers, liberated the thoughts of the management cadres, broke the old business framework, and strongly promoted the mass reform of unreasonable rules and regulations.

In the process of reform, the Revolutionary Committee, following Chairman Mao’s teaching of “paying attention to investigation,” first organized the cadres to conduct a detailed investigation of the old rules and regulations and the actual situation of management work in the factory over the years. Then, based on the principles of emphasizing proletarian politics, emphasizing the leading role of the working class, convenience for the masses, and being beneficial to production, while also being scientific and strict, they conducted a specific analysis of various old rules and regulations, continuing to implement those in line with Mao Zedong Thought, and firmly abolishing those not in line with Mao Zedong Thought (for those involving higher-level regulations, they first reported and obtained approval before changing), and establishing those that were indeed needed but not originally in place. After initial practice, the effects were good. For example, the inventory of cotton yarn, which was originally regulated to be done once a month, was actually unnecessary. Now it is changed to once per quarter. This reduces the workload of the planning personnel by two days per month and saves the factory half a day of shutdown. Some rule reforms not only convenience the masses but also promote the transformation of the cadres’ style. For example, the output of fine yarn, which was originally regulated to be reported once a day, with the team reporting to the workshop, the workshop reporting to the planning department, and the planning department reporting to the factory director. After investigation, it was found that the factory director had never seen this report because he knew more specific situations from daily work reports than from the report. Now the “daily report” is changed to a “decadal report” (the decadal report is required by the higher authorities). The production teams make daily production records without reporting. If the factory planning personnel need this number, they go out of the office themselves to the teams to copy it. These reforms pleased the masses, who said: “Now, with fewer people doing more work, the work is very proactive, with time to study Chairman Mao’s works, time to go to the masses, and time to participate in collective production labor, which is a big deal in preventing the emergence of revisionism.”

Uprooting the Root of “Experts Managing the Factory,” Workers Actively Participate in Enterprise Management

The army must be streamlined, politics must be simplified, and the enterprise must be managed better. Where is the fundamental way out? The factory Revolutionary Committee deeply felt from the previous practice that it was necessary to fully implement the system of workers participating in management in terms of ideology and organization.

Whether or not workers should participate in management is a struggle between two lines and a fierce struggle between “public” and “private.” Due to the long-term opposition of the capitalist roaders to workers participating in management, the poison was deep. At the beginning, some cadres did not believe that workers could manage the enterprise, saying: “Workers have no culture and cannot manage.” Some said: “In the past, we tried worker management, and it proved ineffective.” The Revolutionary Committee believed that these problems showed that the ghost of “experts managing the factory” had not been dispelled, and it still had a deep-rooted influence in people’s minds. If the root of “experts managing the factory” was not uprooted, the workers’ participation in enterprise management would not be able to be carried out, and even if it were carried out, it would not be consolidated.

Aiming at this problem, the Revolutionary Committee held a special study class on workers participating in enterprise management, focusing on studying Chairman Mao’s latest instructions on “following the path of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory in cultivating technical personnel from among the workers” and “fully bringing into play the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in all work.” The Revolutionary Committee, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, organized the cadres and the broad masses of workers to launch a revolutionary big criticism of the revisionist line of managing enterprises. The revolutionary masses angrily exposed: “A small handful of capitalist roaders in the factory labeled traitors and spies as ‘experts’ and ‘authorities,’ praising them for having a system in management and unique insights in technology, completely handing over the management of various aspects of the enterprise to them. Isn’t this letting the bourgeoisie rule over our proletariat?” Some old workers, while recalling their hardships, criticized: “We workers were oppressed by the Kuomintang in the old society, and in the new society, a small handful of capitalist roaders still attempted to let the remnants of the Kuomintang rule over us. In the past, thousands of families managed, tens of thousands of families managed, but they did not let us workers manage. They want to put us workers back in a powerless position, and we firmly do not agree!” Through the revolutionary big criticism, the broad masses of workers further raised their political consciousness, deeply realizing that whether or not to participate in management was a question of whether the working class wanted to be masters of the house, and a question of loyalty to Chairman Mao. The workers in the fine yarn workshop said: “Workers participating in enterprise management is the power given to us by Chairman Mao. This power must be held by the working class!” The workers in the twisting workshop said: “Technology itself is created by us workers from practice. Many reasonable rules and regulations are formulated by us workers through discussion. Why must these rules and regulations be handed over to those so-called ‘experts’ to be controlled, and then ‘manage’ us workers? We workers manage ourselves, and we will definitely manage better than they do.”

After the workers’ enthusiasm and initiative to participate in management reached an unprecedented height, the factory Revolutionary Committee, seizing the opportunity, mobilized everyone to fully discuss “how to manage.” Finally, they concentrated the opinions of the masses and, in each small group, established seven positions: propaganda personnel for Mao Zedong Thought, public security personnel, planning personnel, material personnel, wage personnel, safety and technical personnel, and life service personnel. In terms of technical management, in addition to the safety and technical personnel in the small groups, there were technical research groups in the classes, mainly composed of old workers, technical groups in the workshops composed of workers, leading cadres, and technical personnel, and production and technical leading groups in the factory composed of the three-in-one combination, forming a technical management network from the bottom up with workers participating in the leadership. The process of the emergence of the seven positions of the workers was also a process of mass self-education. The selected workers all had a strong sense of responsibility and honor, saying: “Chairman Mao trusts us, and we must make Chairman Mao proud! No matter how big the difficulties are, we must take on the burden of management, and we will not disappoint the revolutionary masses, and we will not let the class enemies laugh at us!”

The recent series of reforms in the Mudanjiang Textile Factory effectively overcame the tendency to revert to old practices after streamlining administration and reducing personnel, better brought into play the leading role of the working class in the enterprise, further mobilized the socialist enthusiasm of the workers, and the entire factory presented a good situation of revolution and production. The mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in practice continued to rise, the revolutionary big criticism and the work of cleaning up the class ranks deepened step by step, new things in technological revolution and technological innovation continued to emerge, and a new high tide appeared in production. The cotton yarn output in May basically reached the highest historical level, and in July, it increased by nearly 10% compared to May.

    突出无产阶级政治　发挥工人阶级的领导作用
    牡丹江纺织厂大力改革不合理的规章制度
    厂革命委员会在精兵简政以后，及时发现矛盾、解决矛盾，从领导作风、规章制度、管理组织上进行一系列改革，巩固和发展了精兵简政的成果，全厂出现抓革命促生产的新高潮
    本报讯　伟大领袖毛主席最近指示我们：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”牡丹江纺织厂革命委员会遵循毛主席的教导，在实行精兵简政之后，紧紧依靠工人阶级，及时发现矛盾，解决矛盾，从领导作风上、规章制度上、管理组织上进行了一系列改革，巩固了“精兵简政”的成果，更好地发挥了工人阶级的领导作用。
    这个厂实行精兵简政以后，实现了领导班子小，办事人员少的愿望。但是，随着人员的减少，也出现了一些新的矛盾：从常委到一般工作人员，普遍感到忙得厉害，工作顾此失彼，出现了领导成员深入班组少，接触工人群众少，参加生产劳动少的现象。
    精兵简政以后怎么办？这个问题尖锐地摆在革命委员会面前。厂革委会在解放军驻厂毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，回忆总结了往年历次精兵简政之后走回头路的教训，认为当前又到了关键时刻：要么，继续解决新矛盾，沿着“精兵简政”的道路走到底；要么，在旧的习惯势力的阻力面前退却，逐步复旧。革委会认识到这是两条路线的斗争，没有调和的余地。为此，他们依靠工人阶级，向剥削阶级的旧势力进行了针锋相对的斗争，以战斗的姿态主动解决精简之后出现的各种新矛盾。
    依靠工人阶级，什么困难都能克服
    革委会在解放军驻厂毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，首先围绕“新机构和旧机构的根本区别在那里”这个问题，展开了热烈的讨论。在讨论中，他们反复学习了毛主席的教导：“我们共产党人区别于其他任何政党的又一个显著的标志，就是和最广大的人民群众取得最密切的联系。”“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”同时狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在工厂的代理人骑在人民头上、当官做老爷的滔天罪行。经过学习和批判，大家一致认识到，联系群众还是脱离群众，依靠工人还是统治工人，这是革命的新机构同旧机构的根本区别，是革命委员会有没有跳出旧机构圈子的主要标志。正象工人说的那样：“不管怎样精简，要是干部还整天坐在办公室里不到群众中来，那就是没跳出旧机构的圈子。”
    革委会成员一致认为，解决精兵简政后出现的一些新的矛盾，必须从狠抓领导思想革命化，建立密切联系群众的作风入手。革委会决定：（一）常委每天除留二人值班外，其余一律走出办公室，到工人群众中去，和工人群众实行同学习、同劳动、同战斗。（二）革委会工作人员，每天要有二分之一的人深入车间、班组。（三）坚持干部参加集体生产劳动的制度，每星期不少于两天，每年不少于四个月。
    革委会成员下去之后，工作千头万绪，他们首先把向工人群众宣传毛泽东思想，落实无产阶级司令部的号令，作为自己最重要最根本的任务。最近，革委会常委下车间跟班宣传毛主席的最新指示，用毛泽东思想发动工人群众，和工人群众共同战斗，及时识破了阶级敌人的各种阴谋，粉碎了一小撮阶级敌人的破坏活动。有的常委深入到卷纱车间，发现不少机台停了，经过调查，主要是因为人员不足。他们亲自到有多余人力的织布车间宣传毛主席“要提倡顾全大局”的教导，广大工人群众积极响应，抽出三十六人，解决了卷纱车间的问题。前一段天气最热的时候，工人急需防暑饮料。厂革委会成员听到工人反映后，马上找后勤人员一起学习毛主席“我们应该深刻地注意群众生活的问题”的教导，督促有关部门及时把防暑饮料送到了车间。对于革委会成员的新作风，工人群众看在眼里，喜在心里，他们赞扬说：“现在那里有群众，那里就有干部；那里发生问题，那里就有领导去解决。革委会成员听毛主席的话，跳出原来旧机构的圈子，和我们工人在一起了。”由于革委会成员深入第一线，许多问题依靠工人群众就地解决了，因而领导工作越来越主动。他们深有体会地说：“联系群众，如鱼得水；脱离群众，如树断根。紧紧依靠工人阶级，什么困难都能克服。”
        充　分　发　动　群　众，
      改革束缚工人的不合理规章制度
    开始建立密切联系群众的革命新作风，在干部中阻力不小，不少人都喊：“工作忙，下不去。”革委会进行了分析，认为这里面有思想问题，也有实际问题。精兵简政以后，一个人顶过去几个人的工作，而业务手续仍象过去那样烦琐，在一定程度上还是靠少数干部用规章制度“管”工人，这就产生了新机构、新作风同旧的不合理的规章制度的尖锐矛盾。怎么办？革委会认为，只有认真改革旧的不合理的规章制度，才能使广大干部从业务堆里跳出来，才能使工人的积极性、主动性得到充分发挥，参加企业的领导。他们决定充分发动群众，对旧的不合理的规章制度进行改革。
    “现状和习惯往往容易把人们的头脑束缚得紧紧的”。有些干部长期执行旧的不合理的规章制度，脑子里已经形成一个牢固的框框。他们强调，这一条是涉及上级的，上级不改我们不能改；那一条是涉及其他部门的，别人不改我们不能改；别人改了，他们又指责这“不科学”，那“不严密”。
    这些情况说明，如果不把修正主义企业管理制度批深批透，许多干部就不能冲破旧业务的框子，根本改不下去。革委会组织广大干部和工人，以毛主席最新指示为武器，开展了对于修正主义办企业路线和旧的不合理的规章制度的革命大批判。广大群众深刻揭露了工厂一小撮走资派对抗毛主席亲自制定的实现我国工业化的无产阶级革命路线，拚命推行中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线的滔天罪行。这些走资派按照他们的主子炮制的路子，从班组到厂部，从生产操作到女职工给小孩送奶等等，都规定了一个又一个的条条框框，把工人的手脚束缚得死死的。工人形容过去办事之难说：“求山神、拜土地，签字批条关卡多，你推我，我推你，互相扯皮不负责。”广大革命群众集中批判了旧的烦琐规章制度的四条罪状：（一）拖住干部，使他们走不出办公室，不能同工人相结合；（二）吓唬工人，不让工人参加管理；（三）束缚群众积极性，阻碍生产发展；（四）业务挂帅，“卡”字当头，不突出无产阶级政治。大家越批判，越深刻地认识到，这种烦琐的规章制度纯粹是为“专家治厂”的修正主义路线服务的，是为资产阶级专政服务的，是为走资派当官做老爷服务的，工人阶级不需要这一套，非彻底砸烂不可。同时，广大群众还批判了崇拜修正主义企业管理制度的奴隶思想，和不敢想、不敢作的爬行主义。以工人群众为主力的革命大批判，解放了管理干部的思想，打破了旧业务的框子，有力地推动了对不合理规章制度的群众性的大改革。
    在改革过程中，革委会遵照毛主席“注重调查”的教导，首先组织干部对全厂旧规章制度和历年来管理工作的实际情况作了详细调查。然后本着突出无产阶级政治，突出工人阶级领导作用，方便群众，有利于生产，而又科学、严密的原则，对各项旧规章制度作了具体分析，符合毛泽东思想的就继续执行，不符合毛泽东思想的就坚决破除（涉及上级规定的先请示，批准后再改），确实需要而原来没有的就建立。经过初步实践，效果良好。如棉纱盘存，过去规定每月一次，实际上没有必要。现改为每季一次。这样，每月可以减少计划员两天的工作量，并使全厂少停产半天。有些规章改革之后，方便了群众，还可以促使干部转变作风。如细纱产量，过去规定每天搞一次报表，小组报给车间，车间报给计划科，计划科报给厂长。经调查，厂长从来没有看过这种表，因为他从日常工作汇报中知道的情况比表上更具体。现在把“日报表”改为“旬报表”（旬报表是上级要的）。生产班组每天作产量记录，不必上报。工厂计划人员如果需要这个数字，就自己走出办公室，到班组去抄。这些改革，群众满意，他们说：“现在人少办事多，工作很主动，有时间学习毛主席著作，有时间深入群众，也有时间参加集体生产劳动了，这可是防止产生修正主义的大事。”
      铲除“专家治厂”的根子，
          工人积极参加企业管理
    兵要精，政要简，企业还要管得更好，根本出路何在？这个厂革委会从前一段实践中深深体会到，必须从思想上、组织上全面落实工人参加管理的制度。
    要不要工人参加管理，这是两条路线的斗争，也是“公”与“私”的激烈斗争。由于走资派长期反对工人参加管理，流毒很深，开始有的干部不相信工人能够管理企业，他们说：“工人没有文化，管不了。”有的说：“从前搞过工人管理，证明不行。”革委会认为，这些问题说明“专家治厂”的阴魂未散，在人们头脑中还有根深蒂固的影响。“专家治厂”的根子不铲除，工人参加企业管理势必搞不起来，搞起来也不能巩固。
    针对这个问题，革委会举办了工人参加企业管理的专题学习班，重点学习了毛主席关于“走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路”，“要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用”的最新指示。革委会以毛泽东思想为武器，组织干部和广大工人群众对“专家治厂”的修正主义办企业路线开展了革命大批判。革命群众愤怒地揭露说：“工厂一小撮走资派把叛徒、特务封为‘专家’、‘权威’，吹捧他们在管理上有一套，在技术上有独到见解，把企业各项管理大权完全交给了他们，这不是让资产阶级专我们无产阶级的政吗！”有的老工人边忆苦、边批判：“我们工人在旧社会受国民党的统治，在新社会，一小撮走资派还妄图让国民党残渣余孽统治我们。过去，千家管，万家管，就是不让我们工人管。他们要让我们工人重新处于无权的地位，我们坚决不答应！”经过革命大批判，广大工人群众进一步提高了政治觉悟，他们深刻地认识到，参加不参加管理，是工人阶级要不要当家作主的问题，是对毛主席忠不忠的问题。细纱车间工人说：“工人参加管理企业，这是毛主席给我们的权力，这个权我们工人阶级不掌谁掌！”捻线工人说：“技术本身是我们工人从实践中创造出来的，许多合理的规章制度都是我们工人自己讨论制订的，为什么非得把这些规章制度交给那些所谓‘专家’去掌握，反过来‘管’我们工人？我们工人自己管，肯定比他们管得好。”
    工人参加管理的积极性和自觉性空前提高以后，厂革委会因势利导，发动大家对于“如何管理”进行了充分地讨论，最后集中群众的意见，在每个小组设立了七大员：毛泽东思想宣传员、治保员、计划员、材料员、工资员、安技员、生活服务员。在技术管理方面，除小组有工人安技员以外，班上有以老工人为主的技术研究小组，车间有工人、领导干部、技术人员三结合的技术小组，工厂有三结合的生产技术领导小组，形成了一个自下而上的有工人参加领导的技术管理网。工人七大员的产生过程，也是一个群众性的自我教育的过程。当选的工人都有强烈的责任感和光荣感，他们说：“毛主席信任我们，我们一定要为毛主席争气！不管困难多大，也要把管理重担挑起来，决不辜负革命群众的委托，决不让阶级敌人看笑话！”
    牡丹江纺织厂最近的一系列改革，有效地克服了精兵简政之后复旧的苗头，使工人阶级在企业中的领导作用得到了更好的发挥，进一步调动了工人群众的社会主义积极性，全厂革命和生产出现一派大好形势。活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动不断高涨，革命大批判和清理阶级队伍的工作步步深入，技术革命和技术革新的新事物不断涌现，生产上出现了新的高潮。五月份棉纱产量基本上达到了历史最高水平，七月份又比五月份提高将近百分之十。
