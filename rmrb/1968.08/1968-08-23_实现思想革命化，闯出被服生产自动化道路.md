The technical research team of the 3502 Factory of the General Logistics Department of the People's Liberation Army, during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, fiercely criticized the revisionist scientific and technological line of the Chinese Khrushchev, consistently adhered to the study and application of Chairman Mao's works, and focused on the ideological revolutionization of people. They used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to guide the technological revolution, self-reliant and striving for progress, achieving twenty-six technological innovations for sewing machines, thus paving the way for the automation of clothing production.

The technical research team was established in August 1966, at the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The members are all workers and technicians of worker origin. These workers and worker technicians, who were called "clothing craftsmen" by bourgeois technical "authorities," responded to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production" with boundless love for the great leader Mao Zedong. They accepted the task of technologically innovating sewing machines. At this time, a handful of capitalist roaders and bourgeois technical "authorities" within the party said: "Clothing production has already been highly mechanized, why bother with automation? China doesn't have it, foreign countries don't have it, experts can't do it, how can you 'clothing craftsmen' achieve anything?" The challenge from the bourgeois technical "authorities" and the capitalist roaders made the comrades in the technical research team realize that technological revolution is a serious class struggle.

The comrades in the technical research team believed that only through ideological revolutionization could sewing machines be automated. They took "Old Three Articles" as their motto, studying and applying them every day. They treated the process of technological revolution as a process of promoting ideological revolutionization. Using "Old Three Articles" as a weapon, they fiercely criticized the revisionist goods such as "material incentives" promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev, turning monthly award meetings into meetings for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The brilliant "Old Three Articles" inspired them to move forward victoriously. Old workers participating in technological innovation, with a heart full of loyalty to Chairman Mao, were determined to grasp the power of science and technology. Although their cultural level was low, they had rich practical experience. Through diligent study, they achieved many innovative projects and made significant contributions. Young worker Jing Junjie, after joining the technical research team, studied "Old Three Articles" extensively, taking Zhang Side, Bai Qiuen, and Old Yu Gong as examples, using Chairman Mao's teachings on "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people to guide himself. In the study sessions, he openly criticized and reflected on himself, sparking a revolution in his soul, establishing the idea of not seeking fame or profit, not fearing hardship or difficulty, and wholeheartedly serving the revolution through innovation. Together with his mentors, he successfully developed a cross-shaped needle machine. Originally, the inner and outer lines of the waist and shoulder seams required two processes and two machines. With the cross-shaped needle machine, the inner and outer lines of the waist and shoulder seams can be sewn simultaneously in one process, increasing efficiency by more than twofold.

The entire team firmly established the idea of technological innovation for the revolution, channeling the boundless enthusiasm released during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution into technological innovation, demonstrating the boundless wisdom and strength of the working class. They worked day and night on research, conducting experiments once, twice, dozens of times. When encountering difficulties, they used Chairman Mao's teachings to encourage themselves: "Our comrades should see achievements and light in times of difficulty, should raise our courage." They continuously summarized experiences and lessons from practice, continued research and experiments until success. After more than a year of hard work, the comrades in the technical research team finally solved the "old difficult" problems that bourgeois technical "authorities" didn't even dare to think about, achieving the automation of clothing production. Previously, sewing machines had only one head and could sew one seam at a time; now, with multiple heads and cross-shaped double needles, several seams can be sewn at once, and the inner and outer lines can be sewn simultaneously. Previously, some seams required multiple processes and several people to complete; now, with a linked machine, automatic feeding and sewing can be done, and multiple processes can be completed by one person. Previously, one person operated one machine; now, one person can operate two or three machines. The facts speak loudly: only those armed with Mao Zedong Thought can create such miracles.

    实现思想革命化，闯出被服生产自动化道路
    人民解放军总后勤部三五○二工厂技术研究室的革命职工，在无产阶级文化大革命中，猛批中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义科技路线，始终坚持活学活用毛主席著作，狠抓人的思想革命化，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想统帅技术革命，自力更生，奋发图强，使缝纫机实现了二十六个技术革新项目，为被服生产自动化闯出了一条道路。
    这个厂的技术研究室是在无产阶级文化大革命初期的一九六六年八月成立的，工作人员都是工人和工人出身的技术员。这些被资产阶级技术“权威”称为“被服匠”的工人和工人技术员，在无产阶级文化大革命中，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，接受了对缝纫机进行技术革新的任务。这时，党内一小撮走资派和资产阶级技术“权威”出来说：“被服生产已经高度机械化了，还搞什么自动化？中国没有，外国也没有，专家都搞不成，你们这些‘被服匠’还能搞出什么名堂来。”资产阶级技术“权威”和走资派的挑战，使技术研究室的同志们清楚地看到，搞技术革命，这是一场严峻的阶级斗争。
    技术研究室的同志们认为，只有思想革命化，缝纫机才能自动化。他们把“老三篇”作为座右铭，天天学，天天用，把搞技术革命的过程，当作促进思想革命化的过程，并且以“老三篇”为武器，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫推行的“物质刺激”等一套修正主义黑货，把每月的评奖会变成了活学活用毛主席著作的讲用会。光辉的“老三篇”，鼓舞着他们胜利前进。参加技术革新的老工人，怀着对毛主席的一片忠心，决心掌好科技大权，尽管文化水平低，但他们有丰富的实践经验，经过刻苦钻研，实现了许多革新项目，作出了很大贡献。青年工人景俊杰来技术研究室以后，大学“老三篇”，以张思德、白求恩、老愚公为榜样，用毛主席关于“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的教导，来要求自己，在讲用会上亮私斗私，在灵魂深处爆发革命，树立了不图名，不图利，不怕苦，不怕难，全心全意为革命搞革新的思想。他和老师傅们一起，试制成功了十字形针机。原来缝腰肩缝的里外两条线要两道工序，两台机器，用十字形针机可以一次同时缝腰肩缝的里外两条线，工效提高两倍以上。
    全室同志牢固地树立起为革命搞技术革新的思想，把在无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的冲天干劲，用于技术革新，显示了工人阶级无穷的智慧和力量。他们夜以继日地进行研究，一次、两次、几十次地进行试验。遇到困难时，他们就以毛主席“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气”的教导鼓励自己，不断从实践中总结经验教训，继续研究和试验，直到成功。经过一年多的艰苦奋斗，技术研究室的同志们终于解决了那些资产阶级技术“权威”连想都不敢想的“老大难”问题，实现了被服生产的自动化。从前缝纫机只有一个机头，一次缝一道活；现在是一机多头和十字形的双针头，一次可以缝几道活，里外线可以一次缝成。从前有的活要几道工序，几个人来做；现在用一个联动机，可以自动上料，自动缝纫，几道工序一个人就能做。从前是一人看一台机器；现在一人可看两台、三台机器。事实雄辩地说明：只有用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，才能创造出这样的奇迹。
