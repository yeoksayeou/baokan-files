Members of the Fifth Production Brigade of Xiying Brigade, Shangyuan Commune, have studied the works of Chairman Mao, harboring a spirit of loyalty and focusing on practical application. During this summer's harvest distribution, the members studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "In the matter of distribution, we must consider the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual." They vigorously criticized the revisionist fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents on the issue of distribution. The members said, "The Chinese Khrushchev and his agents advocate 'more distribution, less delivery, less retention,' intending to poison the minds of poor and lower-middle peasants and commune members, undermine the collective economy, sabotage the alliance between workers and peasants, and disrupt socialist construction. We will not fall for their tricks. Following Chairman Mao's teachings, the members decided to first deliver the best grain to the state, reserve sufficient seeds, and only then distribute the remainder to individuals. They used several sieves to sift the wheat grains that were blown the farthest by the winnowing machine. Fearing it was not clean enough, they spread the wheat on drying mats and carefully picked through it again. Only when everyone agreed that these grains were truly free of any impurities and unripe grains did they happily deliver them to the state.

    无限忠于毛主席
    积极交售上等粮
    上苑公社西营大队第五生产队的社员，学习毛主席著作，心怀一个“忠”字，狠抓一个“用”字。今年夏收分配时，社员们学习了毛主席的教导：“在分配问题上，我们必须兼顾国家利益、集体利益和个人利益。”狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在分配问题上的修正主义谬论。社员们说，中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人鼓吹“多分少交少留”，是要毒害贫下中农和社员的思想，瓦解集体经济，破坏工农联盟，破坏社会主义建设，我们决不上他们的当。遵照毛主席的教导，社员们决定先把最好的粮食交给国家，留足种籽，剩下的才分给个人。他们把扬场机扬得最远的麦粒，用十几副筛子普遍过一次筛。还怕不干净，又把麦子摊到晒席上，仔细地拣一遍。直到大家认为这些粮食真正是一点杂质和不饱满的麦粒都没有了，才高高兴兴地交给国家。
