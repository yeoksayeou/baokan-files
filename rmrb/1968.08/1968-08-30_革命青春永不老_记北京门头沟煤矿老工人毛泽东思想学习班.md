Every time the sun rises over the eastern hills, casting its golden rays over the western mining area of Beijing, you can see groups of old workers, nearly sixty years old, standing in front of Chairman Mao's portrait at the Mentougou Coal Mine. They wave their red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and sincerely wish the great leader Mao Zedong a long life! Then, they either sit together to study Chairman Mao's works, or they gather to criticize the Chinese Khrushchev with deep hatred, or they practice cultural performances earnestly... They begin their activities in the Mao Zedong Thought Study Class. "Live and learn until you die!"

In the past, under the influence of the fallacious theories of the capitalist roaders who said, "You suffered in the old society, and now in your old age, when you are sick or disabled, just eat and drink, and enjoy yourselves," many old workers here did not pay much attention to national affairs. Gradually, they detached themselves from the fiery class struggle, their vision narrowed, and their hearts shrank. They distanced themselves from the mine they had fought with for decades.

The great waves of the Cultural Revolution surged through every corner of the motherland, touching the hearts of these old workers, causing their thoughts to leap forward. When they met, they no longer chatted about gardening or fishing but discussed national affairs. The more they talked, the more they felt that Chairman Mao was wise and great, and the more they yearned to study Mao Zedong Thought. Under their urgent demand and with the help of the PLA propaganda team stationed at the mine, a Mao Zedong Thought Study Class was established. Over two hundred old workers participated in the study class, looking up at Chairman Mao's portrait, their hearts surging with emotion, their blood boiling. Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! The coal sea stretches to the blue sky, your heart is connected with ours, the miners! Today, we have joined the study class, we are closer to you, our hearts are closer to yours!

The appearance of the old workers' study class had a great impact on the entire mine. Revolutionary masses were all overjoyed, while a small handful of class enemies harbored deep hatred for this new thing. They spread malicious rumors: "Even old workers have started study classes! The weak, the sick, and the disabled can't last long!" Upon hearing this, the old workers immediately posted a pair of bright red couplets in the study class. The upper couplet reads: "Loyal to Chairman Mao, heart unchanged even if the sea dries up and the stones crumble," the lower couplet reads: "Study the 'Old Five Articles,' resolve unshaken even if the mountains crumble and the earth splits," and the horizontal scroll reads: "To achieve new merits." Old worker Li Yuhai has a disability in his leg and has not been to the mine for over two years. This time, when the study class was established, he took the lead in signing up, coming to study every day with his crutch, undeterred by wind or rain, never missing a class. Hearing the malicious rumors, he banged his crutch on the ground and said, "Who says we can't last? Mao Zedong Thought, I will study it until I die! Our study class will never disband this lifetime! The enemy wants to restore the old system, but they won't succeed!"

The old workers' study class has a distinctive feature: they study Mao Zedong Thought every day, fiercely criticize the Chinese Khrushchev, and actively participate in the mine's class struggle.

The mine is deep, and the coal seam is long. Before liberation, which miner did not have a book of blood and tears? These old workers at the Mentougou Coal Mine have personally experienced the inhumane exploitation and oppression by British imperialism, Japanese imperialism, and the Kuomintang reactionaries. They used their personal experiences to denounce the counterrevolutionary fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev, such as "exploitation is meritorious" and "exploitation saves people." In one criticism meeting, old miner Xin Gengzhao, filled with anger, said: "In that dark old society, I, a young man, worked sixteen hours a day and still couldn't eat a full meal. One year, there was a famine in my hometown, and my father came to find me. As soon as he arrived in Beijing, he fell ill. The old man had no money for medicine, so I had to borrow from the office. Those days, people ate people! Borrow five jiao today, and you have to repay one yuan tomorrow. As a result, my old father died of illness, and I was left with a mountain of debt. The Chinese Khrushchev says 'exploitation is meritorious,' meritorious in what way? The Chinese Khrushchev says 'exploitation saves people,' saves whom? He wants to restore the old system, wants us to beg for food naked again, carry coal with empty stomachs. This is absolutely not allowed!"

Most of the old workers have worked for decades. Before liberation, they knew who was good and who was bad. Once, the old workers held a meeting to criticize the capitalist roaders within the mine party who followed the reactionary line of capitulation and betrayal. This stirred deep thoughts in old worker Zhu Fengzhang. Before liberation, the mine's foreman Zhang Wand, was a villain who extorted and did all kinds of evil. Once, Zhu Fengzhang's younger brother, who was over ten years old, was carrying coal in the mine when he suddenly encountered a major collapse and was buried under the stones. The workers wanted to rescue him, but Zhang Wand ruthlessly said: "What's the big deal about a child being crushed to death? There are plenty of people with two legs, but no three-legged toads!" He ordered the workers to blast the stone pile open. Through the workers' struggle, they managed to rescue his brother. When Zhu Fengzhang carried his brother to the mine hospital for treatment, he was again driven out by this scoundrel. After liberation, Zhang Wand fled in fear, but the capitalist roaders in the mine, in need of restoring capitalism, invited him back, letting him stand above the workers and boss them around. This is intolerable! When recalling this incident, the old workers could not suppress their anger and unanimously demanded to overthrow and expose this villain. The Revolutionary Committee, based on solid facts, immediately agreed to the demand. At the struggle meeting against Zhang Wand, the old workers spoke first. Zhu Fengzhang pointed at Zhang Wand's nose and said: "Now that we workers are in power, do you still think you can enjoy your comforts peacefully? No way! Your good days are gone forever!" They struggled with him until he was in a miserable state. The revolutionary masses all applauded in delight! "Where there is a spark of fire, there is a ray of light!"

One morning at dawn, as the workers of the early shift were about to descend into the mine, suddenly a bold song echoed, growing louder and louder. Everyone looked up and saw two teams of old workers, wearing miner's hats and work clothes, spirits high, marching straight towards the mine. Everyone was puzzled, and then military representative Old Liu, panting, caught up from behind, excitedly said: "Comrades, we understand your intentions, but you are all sick and retired people. It's already good that you can come to the study class to learn. ..."

At this moment, old miner Andeping stepped out of the line, interrupting Old Liu's words: "What retirement or no retirement! Chairman Mao is still working every day for the people of the world, and we can't participate in voluntary labor? If we can't do heavy work, can't we do light work? Revolution and production promotion are for everyone!"

The old workers also spoke earnestly: Old Liu, if it weren't for the Cultural Revolution, we wouldn't even think of contributing to the mine's production. But now, if we don't come to the mine for a day, our hearts feel restless, as if something is missing. We, the proletarian revolutionaries, are in charge now, and we must make Chairman Mao proud!

The workers who were about to descend into the mine saw the old comrades still full of vigor, and their blood boiled with enthusiasm. Instantly, the new and old soldiers merged into a revolutionary torrent, surging straight into the mine!

Old miner Zhu Fengzhang, due to his weak health, was not allowed to descend into the mine. He thought: The old comrades have rushed to the front line, and we on the surface cannot fall behind! So, he led the old workers who could not descend into the mine to send water and porridge to the underground workers and push coal carts at the mine entrance, doing what they could.

"Studying Chairman Mao's works is to use them, learn and then use them. We revolutionary miners must be like a piece of coal, giving off light as long as we have a spark of heat," this is the old workers' oath. Since May, they have insisted on studying Chairman Mao's works and participating in voluntary labor every day. Revolutionary masses enthusiastically praised them: "With a body of steel and a heart of steel, armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Though sick in body, the heart is redder, though disabled in body, the will is stronger. Revolutionary youth never grows old, giving off light as long as there is a spark of heat!"

Those who have experienced the cold winter know the warmth of the sun; those who have endured the long night feel the brightness of the sun. The old workers of the Mentougou Coal Mine, their red hearts turn towards the red sun! Recently, under the leadership of the Revolutionary Committee, they summarized the previous experiences, made plans for the future, prepared to raise pigs, grow vegetables, burn small kilns, and work and farm, turning the study class into a red Mao Zedong Thought university.

    革命青春永不老
    ——记北京门头沟煤矿老工人毛泽东思想学习班
    希凤　刘波
    每当一轮红日跃出东山，把金色的光芒洒向京西矿区的时候，在门头沟煤矿，便会看见一队队年近六旬的老工人站在毛主席像前，挥动着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，衷心祝愿伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！然后，他们有的坐在一起学习毛主席著作；有的怀着对中国赫鲁晓夫的刻骨仇恨，召开批判会；有的在认真地排练文艺节目……开始了在毛泽东思想学习班的活动。“活到老，学到老！”
    过去，这里的老工人在走资派“你们在旧社会受了苦，到老来病了、残了，现在，就吃点、喝点，安逸安逸吧”的谬论的毒害下，很多人不够关心国家大事。渐渐地，他们脱离了火热的阶级斗争，眼光浅了，心胸窄了，从思想上和自己战斗过几十年的矿山分开了。
    无产阶级文化大革命的惊涛巨浪，冲刷着祖国的每一个角落，也触及着这些老工人们的心灵，使他们的思想产生了新的飞跃。大家碰到一起，不再闲聊养花钓鱼之道，而是辩论国家大事。他们越谈越觉得毛主席英明伟大，越谈越渴望学习毛泽东思想。就在他们的迫切要求和解放军驻矿毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，办起了毛泽东思想学习班。参加学习班的二百多名老工人，仰望着毛主席像，心潮澎湃，热血沸腾。毛主席啊，毛主席！煤海滔滔接蓝天，您老人家和我们矿工心相连！今天，我们参加了学习班，我们离您老人家更近了，我们的心和您老人家贴得更紧了！
    老工人学习班的出现，对全矿震动很大。革命群众无不兴高采烈，一小撮阶级敌人却对这一新生事物刻骨仇恨，他们放阴风说：“老工人也办起学习班来了！老弱病残，长不了！”老工人们听说后，马上在学习班里贴上了一副红光闪闪的对联。上联：“忠于毛主席海枯石烂心不变”，下联：“学习‘老五篇’山崩地裂志不移”，横批：“要立新功”。老工人李玉海腿上有残疾，两年多来没登过矿门边。这次办学习班，他带头报名参加，每天拄着拐棍来学习，风雨无阻，从不缺课。听到一小撮阶级敌人放阴风，他用拐棍“嗵嗵”地捣着地说：“谁说俺们长不了？毛泽东思想，俺要活到老，学到老，跟到老！俺们的学习班，这辈子是不能散了！”“敌人想复辟，办不到！”
    老工人学习班有一个显著的特点，就是天天学习毛泽东思想，狠狠批判中国赫鲁晓夫，积极参加矿里的阶级斗争。
    矿井深呵，煤层长，解放前，哪个矿工没有一本血泪账！门头沟煤矿这些老工人都亲身尝受过英帝国主义、日本帝国主义和国民党反动派惨无人道的压榨和剥削。他们以自己的亲身经历，痛斥了中国赫鲁晓夫的“剥削有功”“剥削是救人”等反革命谬论。在一次批判会上，老矿工辛更朝怒火填胸地说：“在那暗无天日的旧社会，我一个年轻小伙子一天干十六个小时的活，还吃不上一顿饱饭。有一年，家乡闹灾荒，父亲跑来找我，一到北京就病倒了。老人吃药没钱，我只好到柜上去借。那年月，人吃人呀！今天借五毛，明天就得还一块。结果，老父亲病死了，我也欠下了一屁股还不清的债。中国赫鲁晓夫说‘剥削有功’，功在哪里？中国赫鲁晓夫说‘剥削是救人’，救的是谁？他这是想复辟，想让咱重新光着屁股讨饭，饿着肚子背煤，这，万万办不到！”
    老工人大多数有着几十年的工龄。解放前，谁好谁坏，他们最清楚。有一次，老工人们开会批判煤矿党内一小撮走资派招降纳叛的资产阶级反动路线，引起了老工人朱凤章的深思。解放前，矿上的把头张万德，是个敲诈勒索、无恶不作的坏蛋。有一次，朱凤章十多岁的弟弟在井下背煤，突然遇上大塌方，被石头埋住了，工人们要抢救，张万德居然恶狠狠地说：“压死一个小孩子算什么？三条腿的蛤蟆没有，两条腿的人有的是！”并下令让工人放炮把石堆崩开。经过工人们的斗争，才把他弟弟救了出来。当朱凤章背着弟弟到矿医院看病时，又被这家伙赶出门外。解放后，张万德畏罪逃跑了，可是矿里的走资派出于复辟资本主义的需要，又把他请了回来，仍然让他站在工人头上指手划脚。是可忍，孰不可忍！提起此事，老工人们就压抑不住满腔怒火，一致要求把这个坏蛋斗倒斗臭。革委会根据确凿的事实，马上答应了大家的要求。在批斗张万德的大会上，老工人们首先发言。朱凤章指着张万德的鼻子说：“现在咱工人掌权了，你还想安安稳稳地‘享福’呀？办不到！你们的美日子，一去不复返了！”直斗得这个家伙狼狈不堪。革命群众无不拍手称快！“有一分热，放一分光！”
    一个曙光初照的早晨，上早班的工人正要下井，突然一阵豪放的歌声，由远而近。大家一抬头，只见两队老工人头戴矿工帽，身穿工作服，精神抖擞，直奔矿井而来。大家正感到奇怪，只见军代表老刘气喘吁吁地从后边赶了上来，激动地说：“同志们，你们的心意我们知道，可你们都是有病和退休的人啦，能来学习班参加学习，就不错了。……”
    这时，老矿工安德平一步跨出队外，打断了老刘的话：“什么退休不退休！毛主席他老人家还每天为世界人民操心哩，我们就不能参加参加义务劳动？不能干重活，还不能干轻活吗？抓革命促生产可人人有份啊！”老工人们也都语重心长地说：老刘啊，要不是文化大革命，我们那里还想为矿上的生产出力。可眼下，一天不来矿上，心里就抓五挠六地象少了什么。咱无产阶级革命派当家做主了，可要为毛主席争气呀！
    正要下矿井的工人，见老将不减当年勇，不禁热血沸腾，干劲倍增。顿时，新兵老将，汇成了一股革命洪流，直向井下冲去！
    老矿工朱凤章，因为体弱有病，没有被批准下矿井。他想：老战友们杀上第一线了，我们在井上的也不能落后！于是，他就带领不能下井的老工人，给井下工人送水送粥，到井口推煤罐，干力所能及的活。
      “学习毛主席著作，是为了用，学了就要用，咱革命矿工就要做一块煤，有一分热，发一分光”，这是老工人们的誓言。从五月份以来，他们每天都坚持了学习毛主席著作和参加义务劳动。革命群众热情赞扬他们：“一身豪气一身钢，毛泽东思想来武装。体病心更红，身残志更壮。革命青春永不老，有一分热就放一分光！”
    经过寒冬的人，最知太阳暖；熬过长夜的人，倍感太阳亮。门头沟煤矿的老工人，颗颗红心向着红太阳！最近，他们在革委会领导下，总结了前一段的经验，作出了今后的规划，准备养猪，种菜，烧小窑，亦工亦农，把学习班办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
