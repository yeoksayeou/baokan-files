Chairman Mao, the great leader, and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin received representatives of the capital's working class and officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. Chairman Mao, with a beaming smile and radiant spirit, warmly and enthusiastically waved, clapped, and shook hands with the workers' representatives on the stage one by one. Comrades Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, Li Fuchun, Jiang Qing, Zhang Chunqiao, Yao Wenyuan, Xie Fuzhi, Huang Yongsheng, Wu Faxian, Ye Qun, Wang Dongxing, and Wen Yucheng participated in the reception.

On August 15, the New China News Agency reported: Our most beloved red sun, the great leader Chairman Mao, and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin, along with Comrades Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, Li Fuchun, Jiang Qing, Zhang Chunqiao, Yao Wenyuan, Xie Fuzhi, Huang Yongsheng, Wu Faxian, Ye Qun, Wang Dongxing, and Wen Yucheng, today received in the Great Hall of the People representatives of the capital's workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, the capital's workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, and representatives of the capital's workers. They also received comrades from the PLA General Departments, various military branches, various arms, and the Beijing Garrison's Mao Zedong Thought study classes, as well as revolutionary comrades from some regions who are studying in Beijing's Mao Zedong Thought study classes.

Today, the People's Daily and the Liberation Army Daily, in their editorial "Warmly Congratulate the Establishment of the Yunnan Provincial Revolutionary Committee," conveyed the great leader Chairman Mao's extremely important latest instructions: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully mobilize the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and in all work. The working class must also continuously raise its political consciousness in the struggle." This instruction of great significance has greatly inspired the revolutionary enthusiasm of the working class and the hundreds of millions of military and civilian people across the country. Just as the whole nation is rejoicing over Chairman Mao's great teachings, Chairman Mao received representatives of the capital's working class and other revolutionary comrades, which is the greatest concern, greatest trust, greatest education, and greatest support for the working class and the military and civilian people across the country.

The capital's workers' representatives and revolutionary comrades, including PLA officers and soldiers, came to the reception venue with boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao and deep proletarian feelings, shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!" They repeatedly read aloud Chairman Mao's latest instructions and sang "The Ship of the Great Sea Needs a Helm," "Chairman Mao, We Will Forever Be Loyal to You," and awaited the most glorious moment.

Chairman Mao, with a beaming smile and radiant spirit, and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin, came to the venue amidst a very enthusiastic welcome and received the representatives of the capital's working class and other revolutionary comrades. Chairman Mao warmly and enthusiastically waved and clapped for a long time and shook hands with the workers' representatives on the stage one by one.

The capital's workers' representatives and PLA officers and soldiers, who actively propagate and firmly defend Mao Zedong Thought, were deeply moved and tears welled up in their eyes upon seeing the great leader of the proletariat, the red sun in their hearts, Chairman Mao. They waved the red revolutionary treasure "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao! Wish Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!"

The received capital workers and revolutionary comrades said, Chairman Mao is our supreme commander, and Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all our work. The proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin is the highest command center for leading the working class and the broad masses in revolutionary struggles. We must be absolutely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, absolutely loyal to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We must closely unite around the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, unify our thinking, unify our steps, and unify our actions. We must firmly implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, thoroughly criticize the reactionary bourgeois "multi-center means no center" theory.

They expressed their determination to thoroughly eliminate the poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, to timely expose and smash all the tricks and plots of a handful of counter-revolutionaries who attempt to sabotage and split the proletarian headquarters, to firmly resist the hypocritical two-faced bad style, and to further criticize various manifestations of the bourgeois reactionary worldview such as factionalism, individualism, and sectarianism.

The representatives of the capital's working class expressed their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, to raise their political consciousness, to fully play the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and in all work, to "grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness," to strengthen socialist construction, to develop socialist production, and to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution.

Today, the workers of Beijing took to the streets in large numbers to hold parades, expressing their deep class feelings and enthusiastically celebrating Chairman Mao's reception and the issuance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The streets were filled with drums and gongs, and various banners of celebration and determination were posted everywhere. The joyous procession continued until late into the night. The whole city was immersed in the joyous festival of the working class.
