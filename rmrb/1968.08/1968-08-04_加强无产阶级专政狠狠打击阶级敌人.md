The other major capitalist-roader within the Party, driven by his counter-revolutionary nature, has always opposed the dictatorship of the proletariat. On the eve of the 1957 rightist attack by the bourgeoisie against the Party and the dictatorship of the proletariat, he absurdly claimed, "In recent years, the dictatorship has been too strict. Now it can be relaxed a bit; if not, it would be a mistake." This is utterly ridiculous.

Since the existence of classes, all exploiting classes, from the inhuman slave-owners and the wolf-like landlords to the bone-sucking capitalists, have never ceased their bloody suppression of the exploited classes. They have never "relaxed" their dictatorship over the laboring people. Before they were overthrown, not a single day passed without them strengthening their dictatorship machinery and intensifying their rule over the oppressed classes. Throughout thousands of years of class struggle, there has never been an instance where the exploiting classes "relaxed" their dictatorship over the exploited classes.

"The dictatorship of the revolution and the dictatorship of the counter-revolution are of opposite natures, but the former learns from the latter." The people's state apparatus is also a tool of oppression against the reactionary classes. "It is violence and not something 'benevolent'." The people's state "will not apply benevolent policies to the reactionary actions of the reactionary classes and reactionary elements." Therefore, as long as classes and class struggle exist, the dictatorship of the proletariat must be greatly strengthened, and there is no question of "relaxing" it.

The facts of class struggle in Yuecheng Reservoir show that the overthrown bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, though defeated, remain unrepentant. After the proletariat seized power, the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes did not cease but became more profound, more complex, and more widespread. A handful of traitors, spies, and unrepentant capitalist-roaders infiltrated the revolutionary ranks, seized the Party and government power in Yuecheng Reservoir under the protection of the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, and frantically pushed for bourgeois dictatorship, attempting to restore capitalism. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they fiercely suppressed revolutionary masses, opposed the People's Liberation Army, and opposed the newly established revolutionary committees, repeatedly sabotaging the construction of Yuecheng Reservoir. The heart-rending class struggle in Yuecheng Reservoir tells us that the counter-revolutionary nature of the class enemies will not change; they always dream of restoring their lost paradise. They will never stop sabotaging and causing trouble. Therefore, the dictatorship of the proletariat over the bourgeoisie and all reactionaries should not be "relaxed"; on the contrary, it should be greatly strengthened.

The class struggle under the dictatorship of the proletariat boils down to the issue of power, that is, whether the proletariat will consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat or the bourgeoisie will overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat. Those who attempt to subvert the dictatorship of the proletariat and restore capitalism are the handful of capitalist-roaders, traitors, spies, counter-revolutionaries, and unrepentant landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists within the Party. Faced with such a reality of class struggle, the other major capitalist-roader within the Party advocates "relaxing" the dictatorship over the enemy, which in essence is to weaken and abolish the dictatorship of the proletariat and to protect this handful of class enemies so that they can impose bourgeois dictatorship on the people.

We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, continuously analyze the new situations, new characteristics, and new trends of class struggle, and launch sustained and fierce attacks on this handful of class enemies. We must strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, severely strike the enemy, and carry the political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes to the end.

### 加强无产阶级专政狠狠打击阶级敌人

　　加强无产阶级专政狠狠打击阶级敌人
　　岳城水库革命委员会主任、某部副团长　李永哲
    党内另一个最大的走资派，出于他的反革命本性，一贯反对无产阶级专政。在一九五七年资产阶级右派分子向党、向无产阶级专政猖狂进攻的前夕，他胡说什么“这几年专政是多些”，“现在就可以放宽一点，不放宽就是错误。”真是荒谬绝伦。
    从有阶级以来，一切剥削阶级，从灭绝人性的奴隶主、狠如豺狼的地主，到敲骨吸髓的资本家，无一不是对被剥削阶级实行血腥的镇压，他们从来没有“放宽”过对劳动人民的专政。而且在他们尚未被推翻以前，没有一天不是在强化自己的专政机器，没有一天不在加强对被压迫阶级的统治。几千年的阶级斗争史，从来就没有出现过剥削阶级“放宽”对被剥削阶级专政的怪事。
    “革命的专政和反革命的专政，性质是相反的，而前者是从后者学来的。”人民的国家机器，对于反动的阶级，也是压迫的工具，“它是暴力，并不是什么‘仁慈’的东西。”人民的国家“对于反动派和反动阶级的反动行为，决不施仁政。”因此，只要存在着阶级和阶级斗争，无产阶级专政就必须大大加强，根本谈不上什么“放宽”。
    我们岳城水库阶级斗争的事实说明，被推翻的资产阶级和一切剥削阶级，人还在，心不死。在无产阶级夺取政权以后，无产阶级同资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的阶级斗争，不是止息了，而是更加深入、更加复杂、更加广泛。混进革命队伍中的一小撮叛徒、特务、死不改悔的走资派，在党内最大一小撮走资派的包庇下，窃取了岳城水库的党政大权，疯狂推行资产阶级专政，大搞资本主义复辟。在无产阶级文化大革命中，他们又疯狂镇压革命群众，反对人民解放军，反对新生的革命委员会，一次又一次地破坏岳城水库的建设。岳城水库惊心动魄的阶级斗争告诉我们，阶级敌人的反革命本性是不会改变的，总是梦想恢复已经失去的天堂。他们是不会停止破坏和捣乱的。因此，无产阶级对于资产阶级和一切反动派的专政，决不应当“放宽”，恰恰相反，而是应该大大加强。
    无产阶级专政条件下的阶级斗争，集中到一点，还是政权问题，就是无产阶级要巩固无产阶级专政，资产阶级要推翻无产阶级专政。而妄图颠覆无产阶级专政、复辟资本主义的人，就是钻进党内的一小撮走资派、叛徒、特务、反革命分子和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子。面对这样的阶级斗争现实，党内另一个最大的走资派，鼓吹什么对敌人的专政要“放宽”，实质上就是要削弱、取消无产阶级专政，就是要保护这一小撮阶级敌人，以便他们对人民群众实行资产阶级专政。
    我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，不断分析阶级斗争的新形势、新特点、新动向，主动地持久地向一小撮阶级敌人发起猛烈进攻，加强无产阶级专政，狠狠打击敌人，把这场无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命进行到底。
