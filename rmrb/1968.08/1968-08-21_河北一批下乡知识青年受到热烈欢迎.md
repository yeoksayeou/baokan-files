Firmly following the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions,
Firmly taking the path of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers,
A batch of knowledge youth in Hebei going to the countryside are warmly welcomed.

When the news of these middle school graduates going to the mountains and countryside reached some mountainous villages and the grasslands of the dam area, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres happily said: "We poor and lower-middle peasants welcome these cultured revolutionary youths from the bottom of our hearts."

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang, August 20th: A batch of revolutionary knowledge youths who graduated from high and middle schools in Hebei Province responded to Chairman Mao's great call for knowledge youths to integrate with workers, peasants, and soldiers. Recently, they have been going to the countryside and grasslands in large numbers to settle down. They are determined to become cultured laborers with socialist consciousness in the Mao Zedong era and to contribute their strength to the socialist cause of the motherland.

This year, the revolutionary young graduates of high and middle schools in Hebei Province held Mao Zedong Thought study classes before going to the countryside. They repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's "The Direction of the Youth Movement," the "Three Articles," and the great "May 7th Directive." Based on Chairman Mao's great instruction that "to judge whether a youth is revolutionary or not, what standard should we use? What should we use to distinguish him? There is only one standard, that is, to see whether he is willing to and actually integrates with the broad masses of workers and peasants," they held discussions and realized that graduating students going to the countryside to integrate with the masses of workers and peasants is not just a matter of employment, but a major issue of whether one is revolutionary or not. Many schools invited old workers, old poor peasants, war heroes, and returned knowledge youths to give speeches and share their experiences. Some schools in Shijiazhuang City also organized revolutionary youths to visit old poor peasants and revolutionary cadres in the suburbs with the question "What kind of students do the poor and lower-middle peasants like?" The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants spoke from the heart: Chairman Mao's call for knowledge youths to go to the countryside has touched our hearts. We like students who listen to Chairman Mao the most, and we need revolutionary youths who have socialist consciousness, are cultured, and can help the poor and lower-middle peasants study Chairman Mao's works.

On this basis, the broad masses of graduating students, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, conducted a profound criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents on the educational front, such as "studying to become an official," "going to the countryside for a gold-plated experience," "merging public and private interests," and "suffering a small loss to gain a big advantage." They said: The Chinese Khrushchev tries to corrupt our souls with revisionist poison, making us deviate from proletarian politics, separate from the masses of workers and peasants, and deviate from productive labor, becoming revisionist successors. We will never agree to this! We will firmly execute and defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, go to the countryside, go to the border, go to the factories, go to the grassroots, and temper ourselves into reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

The revolutionary committees at various levels in Hebei Province, various schools, and revolutionary parents gave strong support and care to the revolutionary actions of the broad masses of knowledge youths going to the countryside. Many revolutionary parents, in the Mao Zedong Thought family study classes, told their children the tragic family history of the old society, dug up the roots of bitterness, and remembered the sweetness of the source, educating their children to never forget class suffering, to remember blood debts, and to always be loyal to Chairman Mao, following the revolutionary path indicated by Chairman Mao.

When the news of knowledge youths going to the countryside reached some mountainous villages and the grasslands of the dam area, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres were very happy. They said: "We poor and lower-middle peasants welcome these cultured revolutionary youths from the bottom of our hearts." Many brigade leaderships specially held meetings to properly arrange the settlement, accommodation, and participation in revolution and production of the knowledge youths. The poor and lower-middle peasants cleared rooms, built walls, and made beds for them, introducing the situation and future plans of the proletarian cultural revolution in their brigade to the youths, greatly encouraging them. As soon as the broad revolutionary knowledge youths arrived in the countryside, they immediately threw themselves into the fierce class struggle and production struggle, revolting together with the poor and lower-middle peasants. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants praised them as truly revolutionary youths loyal to Chairman Mao.

    坚决遵照伟大领袖毛主席教导
    坚决走同工农兵相结合的道路
    河北一批下乡知识青年受到热烈欢迎
    当这些中学毕业生上山下乡的喜讯传到一些山区农村和坝上草原时，广大贫下中农和革命干部高兴地说：“我们贫下中农从心眼里欢迎这些有文化的革命青年。”
    据新华社石家庄二十日电　河北省一批高、初中毕业的革命知识青年，响应毛主席关于知识青年要和工农兵相结合的伟大号召，最近纷纷上山下乡，奔赴广大农村和坝上草原插队落户。他们决心做毛泽东时代的有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者，为祖国的社会主义事业贡献自己的力量。
    今年，河北省高、初中毕业的革命小将在上山下乡之前，普遍开办了毛泽东思想学习班，反复学习了毛主席的《青年运动的方向》、“老三篇”等光辉著作和伟大的“五·七”指示，他们根据毛主席的“看一个青年是不是革命的，拿什么做标准呢？拿什么去辨别他呢？只有一个标准，这就是看他愿意不愿意、并且实行不实行和广大的工农群众结合在一块”的伟大教导，展开讨论，认识到毕业学生上山下乡，与工农群众相结合，不单纯是就业的问题，而是革命不革命的大问题。许多学校邀请老工人、老贫农、战斗英雄和回乡知识青年到学校作报告、谈体会。石家庄市一些学校还组织革命小将带着“贫下中农究竟喜欢什么样的学生”的问题，到郊区农村访问老贫农和革命干部。广大贫下中农语重心长地说：毛主席号召知识青年上山下乡，他老人家的话句句说到我们的心坎上。我们喜欢的是最听毛主席话的学生，需要的是能帮助贫下中农学习毛主席著作，有社会主义觉悟有文化的革命青年。
    在这基础上，广大毕业学生以毛泽东思想为武器，对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在教育战线上的代理人所鼓吹的“读书做官”、“下乡镀金”、“公私溶化”、“吃小亏占大便宜”等反革命修正主义谬论进行了深刻的批判。他们说：中国赫鲁晓夫企图用修正主义毒素来腐蚀我们的灵魂，使我们走上脱离无产阶级政治，脱离工农群众，脱离生产劳动的道路，成为修正主义的接班人，我们坚决不答应！我们要坚决执行和捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，到农村去，到边疆去，到工矿去，到基层去，把自己锻炼成为无产阶级革命事业的可靠接班人。
    河北省各级革命委员会、各学校、革命家长，对广大知识青年上山下乡的革命行动给以大力支持和关怀。许多革命家长在毛泽东思想家庭学习班里，向子女讲述旧社会的悲惨家史，挖苦根，思甜源，教育子女不忘阶级苦，牢记血泪仇，永远忠于毛主席，走毛主席指引的革命道路。
    当知识青年上山下乡的喜讯传到一些山区农村和坝上草原时，广大贫下中农和革命干部都很高兴。他们说：“我们贫下中农从心眼里欢迎这些有文化的革命青年。”许多大队的领导班子专门召集会议，妥善地安排了知识青年落户住宿和参加革命、生产等方面的事，贫下中农为他们腾房子、垒墙、盘炕，向他们介绍本大队无产阶级文化大革命的情况和远景规划，使青年们受到很大鼓舞。广大革命知识青年一到农村，就立即投入到轰轰烈烈的阶级斗争和生产斗争中去，和贫下中农一起闹革命。广大贫下中农赞扬他们不愧是忠于毛主席的革命青年。
