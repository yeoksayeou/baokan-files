The great helmsman Chairman Mao, the revolutionary soldiers are forever loyal to you! — Warmly celebrate the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin's reception of cadres from the Mao Zedong Thought study classes of six military regions and other revolutionary soldiers.

A red sun rises before our eyes, and the shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao!" shake the heavens and the earth.

Chairman Mao is here! Chairman Mao is walking towards us!

Our great teacher, great leader, great helmsman, and great commander Chairman Mao, full of vigor and vitality, strides forward with steady steps. Along with his close comrade-in-arms, our beloved Vice Commander Lin, he has come among us!

Millions of hearts are beating fiercely, and millions of smiling faces greet the red sun. We wipe away tears of joy, wave the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and shout enthusiastically to the reddest red sun in our hearts: Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years to Chairman Mao!

August 11, 1968, this is the most happy and unforgettable day of our lives!

Most beloved Chairman Mao! Your health is excellent, and your energy is abundant. This is the greatest happiness for all the soldiers and people of the nation. We, the soldiers who are fighting on the front lines of Fujian, along the Yangtze River, in the Ba Mountains, on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, at the foot of the Tian Mountains, by the Yarlung Zangbo River, and on the vast seas, are forever loyal to you. Today, we gather by your side, basking in the radiant sunlight of the red sun. Our blood boils, and our hearts surge with emotion. We shout enthusiastically and sing joyfully! We sincerely wish you eternal life! Eternal life! Eternal life!

Most beloved Chairman Mao! In the midst of the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, on the day of the glorious celebration of the two-year anniversary of the publication of your great calligraphy "Bombard the Headquarters," the "Sixteen Points" personally drafted by you, and the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, and on the day when hundreds of millions of soldiers and people enthusiastically welcome your precious gifts to the capital's workers and peasants' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, you and Vice Chairman Lin warmly received the cadres from the Mao Zedong Thought study classes of the land, sea, and air forces of the Fuzhou, Wuhan, Chengdu, Kunming, Xinjiang, and Tibet regions, the representatives of the Second Good Unit Conference of the Navy, and the representatives of the Second Conference of Active Learners and Appliers of Mao Zedong Thought of the Artillery of the Beijing Military Region. This is another glorious chapter in the history of our army, and it is the greatest care, trust, education, and encouragement for all the soldiers and people of the nation. Your reception will forever inspire us to march forward bravely under the command of the proletarian headquarters headed by you and Vice Chairman Lin.

Chairman Mao smiles and walks over; sunflowers bloom towards the sun; even if all the waters of the five lakes and four seas are exhausted, they cannot express our loyalty and love for you.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Even if the Yangtze River is long, it cannot compare to your boundless kindness; even if Mount Qomolangma is high, it cannot compare to your genius; even if the sea is deep, it cannot compare to the proletarian feelings of revolutionary soldiers for you; even if the universe is vast, it cannot compare to your great contributions to humanity.

The Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau is far from Beijing, separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, but the hearts of revolutionary soldiers are closely connected with Chairman Mao. Zhang Zide's comrade, former worker in Chairman Mao's entourage, and commander of a certain regiment of the Railway Engineering Corps, Qin Yun, and the political commissar of a certain regiment in Kunming, Du Linsen, are once again fortunate to be by the side of the great commander Chairman Mao.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! You recently presented precious gifts—mangos—to the capital's workers and peasants' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams. You always care for the people and are forever connected with them. How can we forget: In the caves of Yan'an, you wrote volumes of heroic works, pointing out the path to victory for the Chinese and world revolutions. You personally commanded thousands of troops to defeat the Japanese and the Kuomintang bandits, guiding the Chinese revolution from victory to victory; how can we forget: Under the Pagoda Mountain, you had intimate conversations with poor peasants and personally taught us guards to study politics and culture; how can we forget: During the march in Shaanxi, you asked about the soldiers' well-being, gave your horse to the wounded, and marched with us on foot; how can we forget: By the Yan River, you personally participated in the memorial meeting for Zhang Zide, calling on us to serve the people wholeheartedly. We must always remember your teachings and serve the people for life, and be revolutionary soldiers defending you for life!

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! The soldiers on the Tibetan Plateau and millions of liberated serfs stand on the snow-capped mountains looking towards Beijing, thinking of you day and night. The joyous news of your call to Beijing for study spread like the east wind across the snow-covered grasslands, and our hearts have already flown to your side. We braved the wind and snow, day and night, and even felt that the cars and trains were too slow! Too slow! Passing over Tanggula at an altitude of over 5,000 meters, we stood on the snow-capped mountains, facing Beijing, looking towards the red sun, and sang "The East Is Red." Today, the soldiers from the plateau who received your reception, with the loudest voices, wish you eternal life! Eternal life! With the sincerest words, we pledge to you: Our heads may be cut off, our blood may flow, but our red hearts loyal to you will never change!

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! On countless sunny days and starry nights, the coastal defense soldiers think of you day and night. We stand on the islands, patrol the seas, see the red lights on Tiananmen, and hear the flowing water under the Golden Water Bridge. The responsible person of a certain unit on Nanri Island, Chen Zaoqing, after the news of his coming to Beijing for study spread, the entire island's military and civilians ran to tell each other. They braved the scorching sun, faced the waves, and picked the most beautiful shells to make "Surviving storms and waves to forge red hearts, red hearts forever towards Chairman Mao" fourteen shining characters, expressing the loyal hearts of the military and civilians on the Fujian front to you. Today, he and the active learner and applier of Mao Zedong Thought, Feng Fusheng, the political commissar of a certain garrison unit known as the "Red Flag of the Island," and the commander of the "Second Regiment of Jinan," Chen Rimin, seeing you in excellent health, how can they not be moved? They shout "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years to Chairman Mao!" a thousand times.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Far from Beijing, the naval soldiers think of you every moment. Your reception of the representatives of the first study class of the Navy's active learners of Chairman Mao's works last December 3rd became a new starting point for the broad cadres and soldiers to climb the peak of ideological revolutionization. We have extensively carried out the mass movement of taking Vice Chairman Lin, your close comrade-in-arms, as a shining example, forever loyal to you, forever loyal to your brilliant thoughts, and forever loyal to your revolutionary line. Like the waves of the sea, it has pushed the revolutionary construction of the naval forces from one high tide to another. Today, Liu Bensheng, the commander of a certain transport boat squadron of the South China Sea Fleet, which has been evaluated as a four-good unit for five consecutive years, seeing you, shouts enthusiastically: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years to Chairman Mao!" They have been fighting in the South China Sea for many years, undertaking heavy sea transportation tasks. No matter how great the difficulties, they cannot shake the red hearts loyal to you; no matter how harsh the environment, they cannot shake the firm will to follow you; no matter how dangerous the waves, they cannot stop the determined resolve to advance bravely along your military line!

The Yangtze River flows endlessly, and the soldiers' songs of praise are endless. Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! The soldiers fighting in the vast central plains and along the Yangtze River love you dearly. The active learners and appliers of Mao Zedong Thought from the Wuhan Military Region, Song Lushan and Li Guangshan, and the political commissar of a certain regiment, Lou Dianying, brought the red hearts of the broad cadres and soldiers who are forever loyal to you. Li Guangshan obtained a precious portrait of Chairman Mao at the national model representatives' meeting in 1950 and has kept it with him for eighteen years. Most beloved Chairman Mao! In battle, seeing your portrait, one can dare to charge through fire and water; in work, seeing your portrait, one can overcome all difficulties and obstacles; in supporting the left, seeing your portrait, one can remember your latest instructions, stand firm, and be full of fighting spirit. Today, Li Guangshan sees you again, his excited heart is like the surging waters of the Yangtze River and the Yellow River. He, with tears of joy, wishes you eternal life! Eternal life! A thousand times, ten thousand times!

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! The Ba Mountains and Shu waters sing praises together, and the soldiers' hearts have only the red sun. In a fire-fighting battle, the platoon leader of a certain unit in Chengdu, Song Lianxue, was the first to rush into the warehouse engulfed in flames and first discovered the portrait of Chairman Mao on the wall. He, disregarding the pain of the burning flames, tightly hugged the portrait of Chairman Mao and rushed out of the warehouse. Fire can burn his flesh, but it can never destroy his red heart loyal to Chairman Mao! After the joyous news of the leadership cadre of this unit coming to Beijing for study spread, everyone eagerly requested to have Song Lianxue's deed of defending the portrait of Chairman Mao depicted in a painting and brought to Beijing to express the loyal hearts of the broad cadres and soldiers of the Chengdu Military Region to you. Today, the old Red Army soldier Sun Hongdao and the leadership cadre of a certain unit, Dong Zhanlin, seeing you, are filled with excitement and passion, and solemnly pledge: Respected Chairman Mao! We are forever loyal to you, fearing neither mountains of knives nor seas of fire, and our resolve will never waver!

"When the rooster crows, the world is bright, and all rejoice with the music of Atushan." Respected Chairman Mao! You are the great savior of all ethnic peoples. Your brilliant poems forever inspire the broad cadres and soldiers and the various ethnic peoples of Xinjiang to march towards victory. The deputy political commissar of a certain regiment, Liu Zhijian, who has guarded the border for sixteen years like one day, wrote on the Kailas Mountains: Thinking of Chairman Mao while eating, the snow-mixed fried noodles are as sweet as honey; thinking of Chairman Mao while sleeping, the ice caves are warm; thinking of Chairman Mao when lacking oxygen, the body is full of strength; thinking of Chairman Mao while patrolling, the mind is clear, and there are no enemies. Liu Zhijian and the responsible comrades of the units where the heroic soldiers Luo Guangxian and Sima Yi·Maimaidi served, when coming to Beijing for study, the soldiers of various ethnic groups repeatedly urged, in various languages, to bring the hearts of the various ethnic soldiers to the great commander Chairman Mao. They used grains produced with their own hands, one by one, one grain at a time, to create a dazzling portrait of Chairman Mao. Today, Liu Zhijian and the leadership cadres of these two units, looking up at Chairman Mao's benevolent face, how can they suppress their surging hearts? "Long live Chairman Mao!" shouted a thousand times, expressing endless gratitude for Chairman Mao's kindness to the various ethnic soldiers; "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life!" shouted a thousand times, expressing the boundless loyalty of the various ethnic soldiers to Chairman Mao.

Chairman Mao waves and walks over; the red sun illuminates the mountains and seas; following your latest instructions, millions of hearts march forward together.

The Great Hall of the People is brightly lit, and the revolutionary soldiers are filled with excitement.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! You teach us: "The Chinese Red Army is a military group executing revolutionary political tasks. Especially now, the Red Army is not just for fighting. Besides fighting to annihilate the enemy's military forces, it also has to undertake the heavy tasks of propagating to the masses, organizing the masses, arming the masses, helping the masses to establish revolutionary governments, and even building the organization of the Communist Party." In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we responded to your call to "support the leftist broad masses" and undertook the glorious tasks of "three supports and two militaries." In the struggle, we deeply felt that uniting the broad revolutionary masses closely around the proletarian headquarters headed by you and Vice Chairman Lin, propagating your brilliant thoughts, helping the revolutionary masses to establish, consolidate, and develop revolutionary committees, is a major political task for our people's army.

The political commissar of the 6011st Unit and member of the Jiangxi Revolutionary Committee, Xu Hongyun, brought the eight characters made of Ganjiang sand by the "Model Platoon for Supporting the Left and Loving the People": "Chairman Mao waves, and I advance!" During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Xu Hongyun's unit firmly executed the orders of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, striving to "love what Chairman Mao loves, support what Chairman Mao supports, follow Chairman Mao's instructions, and advance when Chairman Mao waves." On this most happy day, Xu Hongyun excitedly said, Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! The revolutionary flames of Anshan were personally ignited by you; the first revolutionary base area in China was personally established by you on Jinggangshan. Now, Jiangxi Province is "red flags flying like paintings," achieving decisive victories in the cultural revolution. But class struggle continues, and we must hold high your brilliant red flag, unite the broad revolutionary people more closely around the proletarian headquarters headed by you and Vice Chairman Lin, thoroughly criticize the reactionary "multi-center theory," unify wills, steps, and actions, follow your great strategic deployment, fully implement your series of latest instructions, and carry this political revolution to the end, letting the revolutionary red flag you personally raised on Jinggangshan fly high forever!

The former platoon leader of the "Red Border Defense Team on the Plateau," political commissar of a certain unit, Zhou Wenjun, traveled thousands of miles to Beijing and saw the great commander Chairman Mao for the first time. His heart was about to jump out of his chest, and he shouted a thousand times: Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years to Chairman Mao!

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! You kindly teach us: "The army must blend with the people, making the army appear to the people as their own army. Such an army will be invincible in the world..." We, the Qiaogela Border Defense Team, have maintained a flesh-and-blood connection with the Tibetan people for seven years since our establishment. We often propagate your brilliant thoughts to the Tibetan people and the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters headed by you and Vice Chairman Lin. Hearing your latest instructions, we immediately held the revolutionary treasure book, facing the high-altitude cold winds and snow, crossed one snow-capped mountain after another, pinned your badge on the liberated serfs' chests, and sent your latest instructions to the hearts of the liberated serfs. The Tibetan compatriots, full of passion, said: "Giving us a mountain of gold, it will eventually be used up, but giving us Mao Zedong Thought, our descendants will be happy forever." Most beloved Chairman Mao! We can leave our parents for life, but we cannot leave your brilliant thoughts for a moment. We must forever read your books, listen to your words, and be red propagandists of your brilliant thoughts, turning the border into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! You teach us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for seizing power and consolidating power." On the two-year anniversary of the publication of your great calligraphy "Bombard the Headquarters," the head of a certain revolutionary committee, Li Baocheng, studied your calligraphy with great significance again and felt especially close. Li Baocheng joined the revolutionary ranks with the determination to seize power for the laboring people and defend power. In the world-shaking battle of Gangwanling, he and his comrades defended the trench for fourteen days and nights. Thinking of defending you and the newly born proletarian power, even the harshest environment seemed sweet. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by you, Li Baocheng's unit undertook the tasks of "three supports and two militaries," firmly responding to your call to "unite the revolutionary masses and seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road," actively propagating your calligraphy "Bombard the Headquarters" and your great theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat to the broad masses, helping the revolutionary masses to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, grasp class struggle, and seriously implement your series of latest instructions. Under the great orders of the proletarian headquarters headed by you and Vice Chairman Lin, the two revolutionary mass organizations quickly achieved revolutionary unity, seized back the leadership power usurped by the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, and established revolutionary committees. Today, Li Baocheng and the old Red Army soldier Huang Mingfu, the former special-class hero of the Volunteer Army Zhao Maoshun, and the former platoon leader of the unit where Huang Jiguang served, Wanfu, seeing the great leader Chairman Mao, excitedly shouted: Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years to Chairman Mao!

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Revolutionary soldiers hold high the red flag, generation after generation following you. The commander of a certain regiment and head of the Leshan Revolutionary Committee, Lin Changxiu, looked up at you, his heart surged with emotion and tears of joy. Respected Chairman Mao! You teach us: "Revolutionary committees must implement unified leadership, break down overlapping administrative organs, streamline and reduce personnel, and organize a revolutionary leadership team that is connected with the masses." Your great teaching is the guiding light for consolidating and developing revolutionary committees at all levels. Revolutionary practice makes us deeply realize that at the crucial moment of achieving comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we especially need our unlimited loyalty to the proletarian headquarters headed by you and Vice Chairman Lin. We put helping revolutionary committees at all levels to actively learn and apply your brilliant thoughts at the forefront of all work, regard firmly executing the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters as the sacred duty of revolutionary committees, grasp class struggle, streamline and reduce personnel, and smash the plots of a handful of class enemies to sabotage revolutionary committees, making revolutionary committees at all levels more consolidated. Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! We must become the pioneers of actively learning and applying your brilliant thoughts in revolutionary committees and the pioneers of firmly implementing the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters, resolutely build revolutionary committees at all levels into leadership teams that are unconditionally loyal to you, forever red and never fading!

The heroic soldiers, Zhang Yingcai and Wei Xiaotang from a certain unit in Kunming, and the political commissar of a certain regiment, Liu Wentang, came before Chairman Mao, unable to suppress their excitement, and shouted loudly: Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years to Chairman Mao!

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! In 1958, when the counter-revolutionary revisionist Peng Dehuai was pushing the bourgeois military line and advocating so-called "regularization" and "modernization," the unit where Wei Xiaotang served firmly implemented your proletarian military line, carried forward the glorious tradition of officers and soldiers being one, and maintained close ties with the masses. Political commissar He Yunfeng led a group of staff officers to go down to the platoons to be soldiers, living among the soldiers in the guise of ordinary soldiers, learning from the soldiers with the most practical experience. Over the past ten years, they have promoted the institutionalization of officers going down to the platoons to be soldiers, which has greatly promoted the ideological revolutionization of cadres. In the "three supports and two militaries," the cadres of this unit followed your teaching: "Without the leadership of the working class, the revolution will fail, but with the leadership of the working class, the revolution will succeed." They carried forward the glorious tradition of officers going down to the platoons to be soldiers, lived, worked, and labored with the workers, humbly learned from the working class, the main force of the cultural revolution, and fought shoulder to shoulder with the workers, achieving one victory after another and greatly promoting the ideological revolutionization of the unit.

Chairman Mao strides over; the soldiers are filled with passion. The great commander points the way forward; they dare to charge through mountains of knives and seas of fire.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Reviewing the forty-one-year glorious history of our army, the gunshots of the Autumn Harvest Uprising, the red flag on Jinggangshan, the road of the Gutian Conference, the dawn of Zunyi, the brilliance of the Yan'an caves, the red lights on Tiananmen, inspire us to advance bravely from victory to victory!

Respected Chairman Mao! Your proletarian military line is the lifeline of our army. Your great teaching of first and foremost building the army politically is forever the soul and direction of our army! You teach us: "The army is the main component of state power." The revolutionary construction of our army determines the nature of our army itself and is also related to the fate of state power. We are determined to follow your teachings, build our army into an extremely proletarian and extremely combat-ready army, and complete the historical mission entrusted to our army by you.

The responsible person of the "Red Spearhead Platoon" from the front lines of Fujian, Song Zhongxian, and the political commissar of a certain regiment stationed in Zunyi, Li Sihui, today saw the great commander Chairman Mao they have been longing for day and night, holding high the red treasure book, shouting again and again: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years to Chairman Mao!" The cadres and soldiers of Song Zhongxian's unit are determined to inherit and carry forward the glorious tradition of the Gutian Conference, forever walk the road of political construction of the army. They hold the red treasure book, cross mountains and rivers, walk the revolutionary road you walked, tread in the footsteps of the Red Army soldiers, and come to the red base area of Gutian you personally established, repeatedly studying the Gutian Conference resolution. In the past, Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice of "arousing hundreds of millions of workers and peasants" and "sweeping away thousands of enemies like rolling up a mat" gave the cadres and soldiers the greatest inspiration and education. Li Sihui's unit is stationed in Zunyi, just like guarding by your side. The lantern, bed, and quilt used by Chairman Mao in Zunyi are the best teaching materials. Every year when new soldiers are recruited, they must go to the conference hall for traditional education. Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! We tread the Long March road of the Red Army, vow to be revolutionary successors, live to defend your revolutionary line, and die to defend your revolutionary line.

The red sun illuminates the Great Hall of the People, and Chairman Mao's brilliance warms the hearts of revolutionary soldiers. "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" This most enthusiastic shout flies from the Great Hall of the People to the coastal defense lines, to the peaks of the Himalayas!

The deputy commander of a certain air force unit, Xia Dianchen, and the deputy commander of a certain regiment in Chengdu, Li Jiulong, today saw the great commander Chairman Mao, and the memories of Mao Zedong Thought guiding their battles surged in their hearts. In the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, Xia Dianchen, after only a few hours of jet training, flew into battle. With a heart loyal to Chairman Mao, he dared to fight in the air with "bayonets drawn," shooting down the new U.S. fighter planes. In the battle to defend socialist China, the pilot of this unit, Wang Zimin, shot down a U.S. plane carrying Sidewinder missiles that invaded our airspace. Li Jiulong's unit, in the War of Liberation, attacked Tianjin, fought at Hengbao, and in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, crossed Yonpo, fought at Jinji, achieving one victory after another. Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! These are all the victories of your brilliant thoughts and your proletarian military line! In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have greatly enhanced our class struggle awareness and two-line struggle consciousness, pushing the Four-Good Unit movement forward by leaps and bounds. We are determined to advance unswervingly along your revolutionary line, building every platoon into a combat collective that is unconditionally loyal to you!

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! In the struggle between the two military lines, the North Sea Fleet's Submarine 125, with its red heart loyal to you, bravely broke through the "underwater no-go zone" set by Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing, establishing a red Mao Zedong Thought school underwater, letting your brilliant thoughts illuminate the underwater journey of ten thousand miles. They wielded the thousand-pound hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, smashing the foreign frameworks and foreign rules. Following your great instruction to "grasp revolution, promote production, work, and preparedness," they excellently completed combat patrol tasks, giving a powerful criticism to the bourgeois reactionary military line. The commander of the submarine, Wang Weimin, seeing you, with tears of excitement, said: Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Your brilliant thoughts are the direction of underwater navigation. Following your military line, we have red hearts, strong bones, and bold spirits, invincible and unobstructed!

The active learner of Mao Zedong Thought in the air force, deputy chief of staff of a certain aviation school, Yan Yuhe, studied by your side and learned your latest instructions: "Universities must still be run. I mainly talk about engineering universities that must still be run, but the system must be shortened, education must be revolutionized, proletarian politics must be in command, and the road of cultivating technical personnel from workers taken by the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory must be followed. Students must be selected from workers and peasants with practical experience, study for a few years in school, and then return to production practice." Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Your latest instructions are forever the guiding light for cultivating successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. We follow your teachings, severely criticize the revisionist educational line of China's Khrushchev, firmly establish your proletarian educational line, and learn revolution before learning to fly. We completed the training courses that would normally take two to three years in just one year. Your reception has added boundless strength to our educational revolution, and we will definitely implement your latest instructions to the letter and carry the proletarian educational revolution to the end!

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! You are the reddest red sun in our hearts. Defending you, defending your brilliant thoughts, defending your revolutionary line, and defending the proletarian headquarters headed by you and Vice Chairman Lin is our most sacred duty. Defending revolutionary committees and being a strong backing for revolutionary committees is the greatest support for the people. We must heighten our vigilance, strengthen our preparedness, be ready to liberate Taiwan at any time, and be ready to strike and smash the subversive, disruptive, and aggressive acts of domestic and foreign class enemies.

Only heroes can drive tigers and leopards, and there are no heroes afraid of bears and tigers.

Great teacher Chairman Mao! The naval soldiers vow to defend you to the death. The commander of Submarine 574 of the East China Sea Fleet, Wang Deshen, who has been evaluated as a four-good unit for seven consecutive years and has won numerous battle merits in various naval battles, brought the ironclad pledge of the naval soldiers' unlimited loyalty to you: The wind may be strong, and the waves may be high, but the determination of the naval soldiers to defend you is even stronger; steel may be hard, and iron may be firm, but the will of the naval soldiers to defend you is even firmer. In the cultural revolution, Submarine 574 braved storms and waves, patrolled day and night on the coastal defense lines, and together with brother submarines, captured U.S. and Kuomintang spies who infiltrated the mainland multiple times, making new contributions to defending the cultural revolution. They are determined to flatten the waves of the vast sea and forge the coastal waters of the motherland into an iron wall!

Great leader Chairman Mao! The border soldiers vow to defend you to the death. The political commissar of a certain unit, Sun Yunxin, who guards the borders vigilantly, the commander of the border detachment at the Naiqula Pass, Huang Guosheng, who severely punished the invading Indian army, and the responsible comrade of the unit where the heroic soldier Zhang Yingxin served, Duan Ruzhi, pledge to you: Even if the sky is cold and the mountains are high, the will to defend you will not waver, and we will turn the borders into an iron wall against imperialism and revisionism!

Great commander Chairman Mao! The air force soldiers vow to defend you to the death. The leadership cadres of a certain flight squadron, who shot down three U.S. unmanned high-altitude reconnaissance planes this year, solemnly pledge to you: We will definitely follow your great teaching of "exerting all efforts to annihilate the invading enemy" and turn the airspace of the motherland into an impregnable air shield!

Great helmsman Chairman Mao! The island soldiers and people vow to defend you to the death. The commander and political commissar of a certain unit on the "Island of United Hearts" on the Fujian front, Tan Qingmao and Liu Yanguang, representing the island soldiers and people, pledge to you: We will definitely follow your great teaching of people's war, with the military loving the people and the people supporting the military, and the military and people united in defense, turning the island into an impregnable sea fortress!

Most beloved Chairman Mao! Across mountains and waters, we look towards Beijing, thinking of you day and night! From the front lines of Fujian to the foot of the Tian Mountains, from the banks of the Jialing River to the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, from the peaks of the Himalayas to the banks of the Yangtze River, from Beijing to every corner of the motherland, the joyous news of your reception of us spreads everywhere!

This joyous news resonates in the hearts of revolutionary soldiers!

This joyous news inspires revolutionary soldiers to advance bravely!

Most beloved Chairman Mao! Your brilliant thoughts are the rain and sunlight for our growth; your great revolutionary practice is the source of our wisdom and strength; the direction you point is our path forward!

Following you, the soldiers' hearts are clear and bright;

Following you, we will not lose our way in great winds and waves;

Following you, there are no obstacles on the path forward;

Following you, we will fight to the end with high spirits!

Most beloved Chairman Mao! Revolutionary soldiers who are unconditionally loyal to you pledge: We will forever take Vice Chairman Lin as a shining example, hold high the great red flag of your brilliant thoughts, and turn the People's Liberation Army you personally created into a great school of your brilliant thoughts, letting your political construction of the army shine forever, and letting the road of the Gutian Conference you opened forever shine!

Great commander Chairman Mao! Revolutionary soldiers are forever loyal to you!

    毛主席啊，毛主席！您最近把珍贵的礼物——芒果赠送给首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队，您老人家最关心群众，永远和群众心连心。忆往昔，我们怎能忘记：在延安窑洞里，您老人家写下了卷卷雄文，指明了中国和世界革命的胜利航程，您亲自指挥千军万马消灭了日寇和美蒋匪帮，指引中国革命从胜利走向胜利；我们怎能忘记：在宝塔山下，您老人家和贫下中农亲切交谈，亲自教我们警卫战士学政治、学文化；我们怎能忘记：在陕北行军途中，您老人家见到战士就问寒问暖，把马让给伤员骑，和我们一起徒步行军；我们怎能忘记：在延水河畔，您老人家亲自参加追悼张思德同志的大会，号召我们全心全意为人民服务。我们要永远牢记您的教导，一辈子为人民服务，一辈子做保卫您的革命战士！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！无限忠于您的西藏高原战士和百万翻身农奴，站在雪山望北京，日日夜夜想念您。您老人家召唤我们来北京学习的特大喜讯，象东风吹遍了雪山草原，颗颗红心早已飞到您的身边。我们顶风冒雪，日夜兼程，还觉得汽车火车跑得太慢！太慢！车过海拔五千多米的唐古拉，我们站在雪山顶，面朝北京城，心向红太阳，高歌《东方红》。今天，受您接见的高原战士，用最宏亮的声音敬祝您老人家万寿无疆！万寿无疆！用最真挚的语言向您老人家宣誓：头可断，血可流，忠于您的红心永不变！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！多少个红日高照的白天，多少个群星密布的夜晚，海防战士日日夜夜把您怀念。我们站在海岛，巡逻在海上，看得见天安门上红灯照，听得着金水桥下流水响。守卫在南日岛的某部负责人陈兆清，要来北京学习的消息传出去后，全岛军民奔走相告，他们冒着烈日，顶着风浪，拣来最美最美的贝壳，制作成“惊涛骇浪炼红心，红心永向毛主席”十四个闪闪发光的大字，表达了福建前线军民对您老人家的耿耿忠心。今天，他和活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子丰福生、被誉为“海岛红旗”的某守备部队的政委丛培文、“济南第二团”团长陈日明，看到您老人家身体非常非常健康，怎能不心潮滚滚。他们千万遍高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”
    毛主席啊，毛主席！远离北京千万里，海军战士时刻想念您。您老人家去年十二月三日接见海军首次学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会代表，成了广大指战员攀登思想革命化高峰的新起点。我们广泛开展的以您的亲密战友林副主席为光辉榜样，永远忠于您、永远忠于您的光辉思想、永远忠于您的革命路线的群众运动，犹如大海波涛，把海军部队的革命化建设由一个高潮推向了又一个高潮。今天，连续五年被评为四好单位的南海舰队某运输艇中队队长刘本生见到您老人家，纵情欢呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”他们长年战斗在南海前线，担负着繁重的海上运输任务。困难再大，难不倒忠于您的颗颗红心；环境再苦，动摇不了紧跟您的坚强意志；风浪再险，阻挡不了沿着您的建军路线奋勇向前的坚定决心！
    滚滚长江流不尽，战士赞歌唱不完。毛主席啊，毛主席！战斗在辽阔中原、长江两岸的战士无限热爱您。武汉部队活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子宋乐山、李光善和某师政委娄殿英，带来了广大指战员无限忠于您的颗颗红心。李光善在一九五○年全国英模代表会上，得到了一张最最珍贵的毛主席像，十八年来，一直带在身边。最最敬爱的毛主席啊！战斗中看到您的像，刀山火海也敢闯；工作中看到您的像，千难万险无阻挡；支左中看到您的像，最新指示记心上，立场坚定斗志昂。今天，李光善又一次见到您老人家，激动的心啊，如滚滚长江水，滔滔黄河浪。他含着幸福的泪花，一千遍一万遍地祝愿您老人家万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！巴山蜀水齐把颂歌唱，战士心中唯有红太阳。成都部队某部在一次救火战斗中，班长宋连学第一个冲进烈火吞没的库房，最先发现的是挂在墙壁上的毛主席像。他不顾烈火烧烤的疼痛，把毛主席像紧紧地抱在怀里冲出库房。大火可以烧伤他的皮肉，却永远烧不毁他忠于毛主席的红心！这个部队的领导干部到北京学习的特大喜讯传开后，大家纷纷要求，把宋连学保卫毛主席像的事迹绘制成图画，带到北京，向毛主席表达成都部队广大指战员的赤胆忠心。今天这个部队的老红军战士孙洪道和某部领导干部董占林见到您老人家，热血沸腾心潮滚，满怀激情立誓言：敬爱的毛主席！我们无限忠于您，刀山火海无所惧，粉身碎骨志不移！
      “一唱雄鸡天下白，万方乐奏有于阗”。敬爱的毛主席！您是各族人民的大救星，您老人家这光辉的诗句，永远鼓舞着广大指战员和新疆各族人民奔向胜利的前方。守卫边防十六年如一日的某团副政委刘志俭，在喀喇昆仑山上写下了豪迈的诗句：吃饭想起毛主席，雪拌炒面甜如蜜；睡觉想起毛主席，冰川雪窟生暖气；缺氧想起毛主席，浑身添劲力无比；巡逻想起毛主席，心明眼亮全无敌。刘志俭和战斗英雄罗光燮、司马义·买买提生前所在部队负责同志，来北京学习的时候，各个民族的战士用各族不同语言千叮咛，万嘱咐，一定要把各族战士的心带给伟大统帅毛主席。他们用亲手生产出来的粮食，一颗颗，一粒粒，镶成了一幅光彩夺目的毛主席像。今天，刘志俭和这两个部队的领导干部仰望着毛主席慈祥的面容，怎能抑制住沸腾的心。“毛主席万岁！”呼了千万声，感激不尽毛主席对各族战士的恩情；“祝毛主席万寿无疆！”呼了千万遍，表达不完各族战士对毛主席的无限忠诚。
　　毛主席挥手走过来，红太阳照亮山和海；最新指示紧紧跟，万众一心向前进
    人民大会堂里灯火通明，革命战士热血沸腾。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您老人家谆谆教导我们：“中国的红军是一个执行革命的政治任务的武装集团。特别是现在，红军决不是单纯地打仗的，它除了打仗消灭敌人军事力量之外，还要负担宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众、帮助群众建立革命政权以至于建立共产党的组织等项重大的任务。”在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们响应您老人家关于“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号召，担负了光荣的“三支”“两军”任务。在斗争实践中我们深深体会到：把广大革命群众紧紧地团结在以您为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部周围，宣传您的光辉思想，帮助革命群众建立、巩固和发展革委会，是我们人民军队重大的政治任务。
    6011部队政委、江西省革委会常委许洪云，带来了“支左爱民模范排”用赣江沙制成的八个大字：“毛主席挥手我前进！”献给伟大统帅毛主席。在无产阶级文化大革命中，许洪云所在部队坚决执行以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的号令，努力做到“毛主席热爱我热爱，毛主席支持我支持，毛主席指示我照办，毛主席挥手我前进”。在这最最幸福的日子里，许洪云激动地说，毛主席啊，毛主席！安源的革命烈火，是您老人家亲手点燃；中国第一个革命根据地，是您在井冈山亲手创建。如今，江西省“风展红旗如画”，取得了文化大革命的决定性胜利。但是阶级斗争还在继续，我们一定更高地举起您光辉思想的伟大红旗，把广大革命人民更紧密地团结在以您老人家为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部周围，彻底批判反动的“多中心论”，统一意志，统一步伐，统一行动，紧跟您老人家的伟大战略部署，全面落实您的一系列最新指示，把这场政治大革命进行到底，让您老人家在井冈山亲手树起的革命红旗，高高飘扬，永远飘扬。
    “高原红色边防队”前任指导员、某部政委周文均，万里迢迢来到北京，第一次见到伟大统帅毛主席，一颗火热的心几乎要跳出胸膛，他千万遍高呼：毛主席万岁！万万岁！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您亲切教导我们：“军队须和民众打成一片，使军队在民众眼睛中看成是自己的军队，这个军队便无敌于天下，……”我们查果拉边防队成立七年来，一直和藏族人民保持着血肉联系，经常向藏族人民宣传您的光辉思想，宣传以您为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的战斗号令。听到您的最新指示，我们立即手捧革命宝书，迎着高寒风雪，翻过一座座大雪山，把您的像章佩戴在翻身农奴胸前，把您的最新指示送到翻身农奴心坎上。藏族同胞满怀激情地说：“送给我们一座金山，总有用完的一天，送给我们毛泽东思想，子孙万代幸福无边。”最最敬爱的毛主席啊！我们能离开爹娘一生一世，不能离开您的光辉思想一分一秒，我们一定要永远读您的书，听您的话，做宣传您的光辉思想的红色宣传员，把边防办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您老人家教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”在您老人家《炮打司令部》的光辉大字报发表两周年的时候，某市革委会主任、团长李保成又一次学习了您的这张具有划时代意义的大字报，感到特别亲切。李保成就是带着为劳动人民夺取政权和保卫政权的决心参加革命队伍的。在威震世界的上甘岭战斗中，他和他的战友们坚守坑道十四昼夜，想到保卫您老人家，保卫新生的无产阶级政权，环境再苦也觉甜。在您老人家亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命中，李保成所在部队担负了“三支”“两军”任务，坚决响应您发出的“无产阶级革命派联合起来，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权”的伟大号召，积极向广大群众宣传您的《炮打司令部》大字报和关于无产阶级专政条件下继续革命的伟大理论，帮助革命群众大办毛泽东思想学习班，狠抓阶级斗争，认真落实您老人家一系列最新指示，在以您为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的伟大号令下，两派革命群众组织迅速实现了革命大联合，把党内一小撮走资派篡夺的领导权夺了回来，建立了革命委员会。今天，李保成和老红军战士黄明甫、前志愿军特等功臣赵毛臣、黄继光生前所在连队连长万福来，见到了伟大领袖毛主席，激动地一遍遍地高呼：毛主席万岁！万万岁！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！革命战士举红旗，世世代代紧跟您。成都部队某师师长、乐山地区革委会主任林长修，仰望着您老人家，心潮激荡喜泪流。敬爱的毛主席！您老人家教导我们：“革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”您这一伟大教导是巩固和发展各级革委会的指路明灯。革命实践使我们深刻认识到：在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的关键时刻，特别需要我们对以您为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的无限忠诚。我们把帮助各级革委会活学活用您的光辉思想，放在一切工作的首位，把坚决执行无产阶级司令部的战斗号令，做为革委会的神圣职责，狠抓阶级斗争，实行精兵简政，粉碎了一小撮阶级敌人破坏革委会的阴谋，使各级革委会越来越巩固。毛主席啊，毛主席！我们一定要在革委会里，成为活学活用您的光辉思想的带头人，成为坚决贯彻执行无产阶级司令部战斗号令的带头人，坚决把各级革委会建设成无限忠于您老人家的领导班子，千秋万代永不变色！
    战斗英雄、昆明部队某部张英才、卫小堂，某团政委刘文堂来到了毛主席面前，抑制不住内心的激动，放声高呼：毛主席万岁！万万岁！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！一九五八年，正当反革命修正主义分子彭德怀推行资产阶级军事路线，大搞所谓“正规化”、“现代化”的时候，卫小堂所在部队坚决贯彻您的无产阶级建军路线，发扬我军官兵一致的光荣传统，保持了和群众的密切联系。政委何云峰同志带领一批机关干部下连当兵，处处以普通一兵的姿态生活在战士之中，向最有实践经验的战士学习。十年来，他们把干部下连当兵代职的制度，有力地促进了干部的思想革命化。在“三支”“两军”中，这个部队的干部遵循您老人家的教导：“没有工人阶级的领导，革命就要失败，有了工人阶级的领导，革命就胜利了。”发扬了干部下连当兵的光荣传统，与工人同吃、同住、同劳动，虚心向文化大革命的主力军工人阶级学习，和工人同志并肩战斗，取得了一个个胜利，也大大促进了部队的思想革命化。
　　毛主席健步走过来，战士激情满胸怀；伟大统帅指航向，刀山火海也敢闯
    毛主席啊，毛主席！回顾我军四十一年的光辉历程，那秋收起义的枪声，井冈山的红旗，古田会议的道路，遵义城的朝霞，延安窑洞的光芒，天安门上的红灯，激励着我们奋勇前进，从胜利走向胜利！
    敬爱的毛主席啊！您的无产阶级建军路线是我军的生命线。您的首先和着重从政治上建军的伟大教导，永远是我军的灵魂，是我军的方向！您老人家教导我们：“军队是国家政权的主要成份。”我军的革命化建设决定着我军本身的性质，也关系到国家政权的命运。我们决心遵照您老人家的教导，把我军建设成非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的军队，完成您老人家交给我军的历史使命。
    来自福建前线的“红色尖刀连”所在部队负责人宋忠贤，驻守遵义的某团政委李思怀，今天见到了日夜想念的伟大统帅毛主席，红色宝书高高举，一遍又一遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”宋忠贤所在部队的指战员，决心继承和发扬古田会议的光荣传统，永远走政治建军的道路。他们手捧红色宝书，跋山涉水，走着毛主席走过的革命路，踏着红军战士的足迹，来到毛主席亲手创建的红色根据地古田，反复学习古田会议决议。当年，毛主席“唤起工农千百万”、“横扫千军如卷席”的伟大革命实践，给指战员最大的鼓舞和教育。李思怀所在部队驻守在遵义，就象守卫在毛主席身边。毛主席在遵义用过的马灯，睡过的木床，盖过的毛毯，都是最好最好的教材。每年新战士入伍，都要到会议楼进行传统教育。毛主席啊，毛主席！我们脚踏红军长征路，誓做革命接班人，生为捍卫您的革命路线战斗，死为捍卫您的革命路线献身。
    红太阳照亮了人民大会堂，毛主席的光辉温暖着革命战士的心房。“万岁，毛主席！”“万岁，战无不胜的毛泽东思想！”这最热烈的欢呼声啊，从人民大会堂飞向海防前线，飞向喜马拉雅山巅！
    空军某部副师长夏殿臣，成都部队某师副师长李九龙，今天见到了伟大统帅毛主席，毛泽东思想指挥他们战斗的往事涌心头。在抗美援朝战争中，夏殿臣只经过十几个小时的歼击机飞行训练，就架着战鹰参加战斗。他怀着一颗保卫毛主席的红心，敢于在空中
  “刺刀见红”，把美帝新式战斗机揍了下来。在保卫社会主义祖国的战斗中，这个部队的飞行员王子民，又把侵入我国领空的美帝带响尾蛇导弹的飞机打了个稀巴烂。李九龙所在部队在解放战争中，攻天津，打衡宝，在抗美援朝战争中，过元山，战金城，取得了一个又一个的胜利。毛主席啊，毛主席！这都是您光辉思想的指引，这都是您的无产阶级建军路线的伟大胜利！在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们大大提高了阶级斗争观念和两条路线斗争觉悟，把四好连队运动大大向前推进了一步。我们决心坚定不移地沿着您的革命路线前进，把每一个连队都建设成无限忠于您的战斗集体！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！在两条军事路线斗争中披荆斩棘创四好的北海舰队一二五潜艇，凭着对您的赤胆忠心，英勇地冲破了彭德怀、罗瑞卿设下的“出海不能学习毛主席著作”的“水下禁区”，在水下办起红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校，让您的光辉思想照亮了水下万里航程。他们奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，砸烂了洋框框、洋条条。并遵照您“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”的伟大指示，出色地完成了战斗巡逻任务，给资产阶级反动的军事路线以最有力的批判。艇长王为明见到您老人家，含着激动的泪花说：毛主席啊，毛主席！您的光辉思想是水下航行的方向，沿着您的建军路线前进，我们就心红骨硬胆子壮，所向披靡无阻挡！
    空军学习毛主席著作积极分子、某航校副参谋长阎玉和，在毛主席身边学习了毛主席的最新指示：“大学还是要办的，我这里主要说的是理工科大学还要办，但学制要缩短，教育要革命，要无产阶级政治挂帅，走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路。要从有实践经验的工人农民中间选拔学生，到学校学几年以后，又回到生产实践中去。”毛主席啊，毛主席！您的最新指示，永远是我们培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的指路明灯。
　　实践使我们认识到，要想培养出过硬的飞行员，就“要无产阶级政治挂帅”，培养无限忠于您、无限忠于您的光辉思想、无限忠于您的革命路线的革命战士。我们遵循您的教导，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义教育路线，大立您的无产阶级教育路线，学飞行先学革命。我们用一年时间，就完成了过去两三年内才能完成的训练课目。您的接见，给我们进行教育革命增添了无穷无尽的力量，我们一定不折不扣地执行您的最新指示，把无产阶级教育革命进行到底！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您是我们心中最红最红的红太阳，誓死保卫您、保卫您的光辉思想、保卫您的革命路线、保卫以您为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，是我们最最神圣的职责。保卫革命委员会，作革命委员会的强大后盾，是最大的拥政爱民。我们一定要提高警惕，加强战备，随时准备解放祖国领土台湾，随时准备打击和粉碎国内外阶级敌人的颠覆、破坏和侵略。
    独有英雄驱虎豹，更无豪杰怕熊罴。
    伟大导师毛主席啊！海军战士誓死保卫您。连续七年被评为四好艇、在历次海战中屡立战功的东海舰队五七四艇指导员王德银，带来了海军战士无限忠于您的钢铁誓言：风大浪大，没有海军战士保卫您的决心大；钢坚铁坚，没有海军战士保卫您的意志坚。在文化大革命中，五七四艇战狂风，闯恶浪，日夜巡逻在海防线上，和兄弟艇一起多次捕获了窜犯大陆的美蒋特务，为保卫文化大革命作出了新的贡献。他们决心踏平大海万顷浪，誓把祖国领海铸成钢铁长城！
    伟大领袖毛主席啊！边防战士誓死保卫您。警惕地守卫祖国边疆的某部政委孙云馨、在乃堆拉山口严厉惩罚入侵印军的我边防分队指挥员黄国胜、战斗英雄张映鑫生前所在部队负责人段如智，向您宣誓：天再寒，山再高，保卫您的意志不动摇，誓把边疆变成反帝反修的铁壁铜墙！

    最最敬爱的毛主席啊！隔山隔水望北京，战士日夜想念您！从福建前线到天山脚下，从嘉陵江畔到云贵高原，从喜马拉雅山巅到长江两岸，从北京到祖国的四面八方，您老人家接见我们的特大喜讯，到处传扬！
