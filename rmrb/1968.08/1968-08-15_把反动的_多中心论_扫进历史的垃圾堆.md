The reactionary "multi-center theory" must be swept into the dustbin of history.

Active learner and practitioner of Mao Zedong Thought, Deputy Director of the Political Department of a certain unit in the Air Force, Feng Fusheng.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Communist Party of China is the core leadership of the entire Chinese people. Without this core, the cause of socialism cannot be victorious." The proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin is the sole leadership center for the entire Party, the entire military, the entire nation, and all revolutionary masses. Apart from this, there cannot be a second center. The "multi-center theory" is a reactionary bourgeois theory that must be thoroughly criticized.

Under the wise leadership of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, the people of our country have overcome countless difficulties on the revolutionary road, navigated all the reefs in the revolutionary voyage, defeated the armed-to-the-teeth class enemies at home and abroad, overthrown the three big mountains that had been weighing down on the people, and established a socialist state under the dictatorship of the proletariat. Under the guidance of this sole center and Chairman Mao's entire set of theories, lines, policies, and principles on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, we have carried out an unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This revolution exposed and smashed the bourgeois headquarters within our Party, headed by the Chinese Khrushchev. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has trained a large number of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, shattered the illusions of the imperialist prophets who had hoped for a "peaceful evolution" in the third or fourth generation of the Chinese Party, and ensured that the proletarian iron mountain of our country will remain unshakable for thousands of generations. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has pushed the socialist revolution to a new stage and opened up a new historical era for the international communist movement.

History has proven that, at any time and under any circumstances, as long as we act according to the instructions of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, this sole leadership center, the revolution will advance, develop, and achieve victory. Conversely, if we deviate even slightly from this leadership center and advocate "my center" or "multi-center," the revolution will suffer setbacks and failures. Within our Party, the largest clique of capitalist roaders, such as Chen Duxiu, Zhang Guotao, Wang Ming, and the Chinese Khrushchev, opposed Chairman Mao's correct leadership. They wanted to be the "center," resulting in significant losses for the revolution, and they themselves have all completely collapsed. Today, anyone who insists on "my center" and advocates the "multi-center theory" will not have a better fate.

What attitude one takes towards the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao is the dividing line and touchstone between revolution and counter-revolution, between Marxism-Leninism and revisionism. In the hearts of our workers, peasants, and soldiers, there is only the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. We listen to every word and follow every instruction from the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao. Anyone who tries to establish another center is miscalculating and underestimating the consciousness and strength of our workers, peasants, and soldiers. Those who persist in the "multi-center theory" will inevitably be rejected by the people and swept into the dustbin of history.

We must unite more closely under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, remain forever loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and to the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. We must thoroughly criticize the reactionary bourgeois "multi-center theory," implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. Under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters, we must unite our will, our steps, and our actions to struggle for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

　　把反动的“多中心论”扫进历史的垃圾堆
　　活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子空军某部政治处副主任  丰福生
    毛主席教导我们：“中国共产党是全中国人民的领导核心。没有这样一个核心，社会主义事业就不能胜利。”以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，是全党、全军、全国和广大革命群众唯一的领导中心。除此之外，不能有第二个中心。“多中心论”是一种反动的资产阶级的理论，必须彻底批判。
    我国人民在以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部这个领导中心的英明领导之下，战胜了革命道路上无数的困难，绕过了革命航程中的一切暗礁，打败了国内外武装到牙齿的阶级敌人，推翻了压在人民头上的三座大山，建立了无产阶级专政的社会主义国家。在这个唯一的中心的领导之下，在毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续革命的一整套理论、路线、方针和政策的指引下，进行了史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，揭露和摧毁了隐藏在我们党内的以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部。无产阶级文化大革命锻炼了大批无产阶级革命事业的接班人，使帝国主义的预言家们把“和平演变”的希望寄托在中国党的第三代或者第四代身上的迷梦彻底破产，保证了我国无产阶级铁打的江山千秋万代不变色。无产阶级文化大革命把社会主义革命推向新的阶段，为国际共产主义运动开辟了新的历史纪元。
    历史已经证明，不论在任何时候，任何情况下，只要按毛主席的无产阶级司令部这个唯一的领导中心的指示办事，革命就前进，就发展，就胜利；反之，如果稍稍离开了这个领导中心，搞什么“以我为中心”、“多中心”，革命就要遭受挫折和失败。在我们党内，陈独秀、张国焘、王明和中国赫鲁晓夫等最大的一小撮走资派，反对毛主席的正确领导，他们想要做“中心”，结果给革命造成了重大损失，他们自己也一个一个地彻底垮台了。在今天，谁还要坚持“以我为中心”，搞什么“多中心论”，也绝不会有比他们好的下场。
    对以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部抱什么态度，是革命和反革命、马克思列宁主义和修正主义的分水岭和试金石。在我们工农兵心目中，就是只有以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部这个领导中心。对于以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的话，我们句句听，字字照办。谁要另立什么别的中心，那是打错了算盘，低估了我们工农兵的觉悟和力量。搞“多中心论”的人，如果顽固地走下去，必然要被人民所唾弃，被人民扫进历史的垃圾堆。
    我们一定要在以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的领导下更紧密地团结起来，永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，忠于以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部。我们要彻底批判反动的资产阶级的“多中心论”，把毛主席的最新指示落实再落实，对毛主席的伟大战略部署紧跟再紧跟，在无产阶级司令部领导下，统一意志，统一步伐，统一行动，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利斗争到底！
