The car climbed over the Dayue Mountain and sped across the vast Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Soon, we arrived at the logistics department's station by the sparkling Qinghai Lake. We entered the station, carrying the fatigue of our long journey. A young receptionist welcomed us with a warm smile and eager hands, making us feel instantly refreshed and free from the day's travel weariness. Who was he? He was Zhang Haijiang, a high school graduate who had enlisted this year. Everyone praised him as a model for fighting for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

From Student to Soldier

Zhang Haijiang was originally a student at Luonan Middle School in Shaanxi Province. During the early days of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he was persecuted by the bourgeois reactionary line. Later, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, he joined the broad revolutionary masses to thoroughly criticize the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie. In the midst of class struggle, Zhang Haijiang was elected as one of the leaders of the school's revolutionary mass organization and became a standing committee member of the county's Red Guards organization.

This year, at the beginning of the year, Zhang Haijiang responded to the Party's call and actively enlisted. At that time, the Luonan County Revolutionary Committee was about to be established. Someone told him, "You are a standing committee member of the county Red Guards organization, and you have been nominated to be a member of the county revolutionary committee. You don't need to enlist for the time being!"

Should he stay at home to be a committee member or go to the army to be a soldier? Zhang Haijiang thought: The People's Liberation Army is the strong pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the steel wall defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. As the son of a poor peasant, I need to go to the front line to show my loyalty to Chairman Mao. Being a committee member or a common soldier, both are serving the people. After thinking this way, Zhang Haijiang enthusiastically enlisted and became a glorious soldier of the People's Liberation Army.

From "Little Jiangnan" to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau

Zhang Haijiang's hometown, Luonan County, is located in southeastern Shaanxi, with lush mountains and clear waters, often referred to as "Little Jiangnan." After enlisting, he traveled thousands of miles to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and was assigned to work at the station. As the saying goes, "After crossing the Dayue Mountain, the grasslands seem endless." Here, people are sparse, and the climate is harsh. Even in summer, one cannot do without cotton clothes. He wondered, how could he stay in such a place?

At this time, the army conducted a class education, and Zhang Haijiang recalled the hardships his family endured in the old society and the persecution he suffered under the bourgeois reactionary line. At the meeting, he angrily said: In the old society, we poor people had no power and suffered so much humiliation! It was the Party and Chairman Mao who led us to liberation and a happy life. The Party's kindness is greater than the heavens and the earth, and Chairman Mao's kindness is greater than that of parents. Today, the Party and Chairman Mao have called me to the plateau. Although the plateau is harsh, this is my post to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The more difficult the place, the more we should go there. This is what a good comrade should do." How can I be afraid of hardship and retreat? I must firmly plant my roots on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

His feelings changed, and he found everything here, from the grass and trees to every stone and grain of sand, to be lovely. He often shared his experiences with his fellow soldiers who enlisted at the same time and studied the "Three Articles" with those who were not yet settled in their work on the plateau, discussing their learning experiences and helping them quickly settle down and actively engage in work and station construction.

Determined to Be a Red Receptionist

The leadership assigned Zhang Haijiang to be a receptionist, responsible for daily tasks such as fetching water, sweeping, and making beds. Previously, he was a leader of the mass organization, a person who issued orders; now, he had to take care of the lives of passing comrades. As a high school graduate, coming to the army to drive a car or fly a plane, wouldn't that be a better way to serve the people? How should he correctly view this issue? He opened Chairman Mao's works and studied the "Three Articles" again. By comparing the "Three Articles" with his own thoughts, he discovered that his soul still harbored many selfish thoughts. He must resolutely fight against the bourgeois "self" and take Zhang Zide and Norman Bethune as examples to fight against the "self" in his mind. At the station's general meeting, he bravely exposed his selfish thoughts, deeply excavating the roots of "self," and fiercely criticizing the revisionist fallacies of China's Khrushchev's "fusion of public and private."

Through criticism, he realized: Previously, as a student, participating in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was to defend Chairman Mao; today, enlisting in the army as a receptionist, this work is equally important. This is my new battlefield to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. For a high school graduate like me, this is not a case of big talent in a small role but of insufficient ability.

With a clear mind, he devoted his whole heart to doing a good job in reception work. The rooms were cleaned spotlessly, and he warmly welcomed passing comrades, bringing them hot water and washing water. Sometimes at night, sporadic vehicles kept coming, and he worked tirelessly all night without proper rest, yet the next day he was still full of energy and ready to work. He also set up a revolutionary criticism column and a learning column in his reception room. While doing a good job in reception work, he also wrote some small programs himself to propagate Mao Zedong Thought to passing comrades and timely conveyed Chairman Mao's latest instructions and domestic and international news from the radio.

In the few months Zhang Haijiang has been in the reception room, the appearance of the reception room has changed greatly, receiving unanimous praise from the army.

### 青藏高原上的普通一兵

    青藏高原上的普通一兵
    汽车翻过日月山，在广阔无垠的青藏高原上奔驰着。不一会儿，便到了绿水粼粼的青海湖边总后勤部兵站。我们带着长途跋涉的疲劳走进了兵站的大门，迎接我们的是一位年轻的招待员。他那可亲的笑容和勤快的双手，处处给人以温暖的感觉，使我们一天旅行的疲劳一扫而光。他是谁？他便是高中毕业生、今年入伍的新战士张海江同志，人们夸他是处处为毛主席革命路线战斗的好榜样。从学生到解放军战士
    张海江同志原来是陕西省洛南中学的学生。无产阶级文化大革命初期，受到资产阶级反动路线的迫害。以后，他在毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，和广大革命群众一起，大造党内一小撮走资派的反，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线。在阶级斗争的风浪中，张海江被推选为学校革命群众组织的负责人之一，成了全县红卫兵组织的常委。
    今年年初，张海江响应党的号召，积极报名应征入伍。当时，洛南县革命委员会就要成立了。有人对他说：“你是县红卫兵组织的常委，已经提名你当县革委会委员了，暂时就不要入伍了吧！”
    是留在家里当委员呢，还是到部队当兵去？张海江想：中国人民解放军，是无产阶级专政的坚强柱石，是保卫无产阶级文化大革命的钢铁长城，我这个贫农的儿子正需要到这个第一线去向毛主席献忠心；当常委、委员是为人民服务，当普通一兵也是为人民服务。这样想了之后，张海江便满腔热情地报名应征入伍，当上了光荣的人民解放军战士。从“小江南”到青藏高原
    张海江的家乡洛南县，位处陕西东南，山青水秀，有人称它为“小江南”。入伍后，经过几千里路的跋涉，他来到了青藏高原，被分配到兵站工作。常言道：过了日月山，草原望不到边。这里人烟稀少，气候严寒，夏天还离不开棉衣。他想，在这个地方怎么呆下去呢？
    这时，部队进行了阶级教育，张海江回忆了自己家在旧社会的苦难生活，回忆了受资产阶级反动路线的迫害。在会上，他气愤地说：旧社会，我们穷人没有印把子，受了多少欺侮！是党和毛主席领导我们得解放，过上了幸福的生活，天大地大不如党的恩情大，爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲。今天，党和毛主席叫我来高原，高原虽然艰苦，但这是我捍卫毛主席革命路线的岗位。毛主席教导我们：“越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”我怎么能害怕艰苦而退却呢？一定要在青藏高原深深扎下根。
    思想感情一变，他觉得这里的一草一木，一块石头一把沙子都非常可爱。他还经常把自己的体会和一同入伍的同志交谈，和在高原工作还不太安心的同志一起学习“老三篇”，谈学习心得体会，使他们也很快地安下心，积极投入了工作和兵站建设。决心做个红色招待员领导上分配张海江当招待员，每天打水扫地叠被褥。以前，他是群众组织的头头，是“发号施令”的人；现在，他却要照顾过往战友的生活。自己是高中生，到部队来开汽车或开飞机，不是能更好地为人民服务吗？现在，怎样正确对待这个问题呢？他打开毛主席著作，再一次学习毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”。他用光辉的“老三篇”和自己的想法一对照，发现自己的灵魂深处，还藏着不少私心杂念。必须和资产阶级的
  “私”字作坚决的斗争。他以张思德、白求恩为榜样，狠斗自己头脑里的“私”字。在全站人员大会上，他大胆地亮出了自己的私心杂念，深挖“私”字的根源，对中国赫鲁晓夫的“公私溶化”论等修正主义谬论，狠狠地进行批判。
    通过批判，他认识到：以前当学生，搞无产阶级文化大革命是保卫毛主席；今天参军当招待员，这个工作同样是个重要工作，这是我捍卫毛主席革命路线的新的战斗岗位。这个岗位对我这个高中生来说，不是大材小用，而是能力不够用。
    思想通了，他以满腔的热情来搞好招待工作，房子打扫得干干净净，热情地迎送过往的战友，把开水送到他们手里，把洗脸水送到他们屋里。有时晚上，零星车辆不断来，他不辞劳累，忙了一夜，没有好好休息，第二天照样精力充沛地投入工作。他还在自己的招待室里办起了革命大批判专栏和学习栏。在搞好招待工作的同时，他还自己动手编一些小节目，向过往的战友宣传毛泽东思想，及时地把每天从收音机里听来的毛主席最新指示和国内外大事，向过往战友宣传。
    张海江到招待室几个月来，使招待室的面貌发生了很大变化，受到部队的一致好评。
