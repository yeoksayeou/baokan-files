The Chinese Khrushchovs and their ilk are brandishing the big sticks of "simplification" and "vulgarization" to oppose and slander the workers, peasants, and soldiers in their active study and application of Chairman Mao's works. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in the Xiaotangshan area have decided to use their actual actions in actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to refute the slanders of the Chinese Khrushchovs and their ilk. The following group of short stories are a volley of shells fired at the Chinese Khrushchovs.

	The red sun shines in the heart, fearless in danger, showing great courage.

	In April of this year, the members and cadres of the third production brigade of the Hai Zi brigade of Shangzhuang commune were blasting mountains and leveling ditches on South Mountain. During one blast, the fuse had already been lit, and more than twenty members had run out of the danger zone. The blast sounded, and stones rolled down. Suddenly, a shout came from a distant group of members: "There are our mules tied to the trees below!" At this moment, one mule had already broken its reins and was running into the woods, while another mule was still tied to a plum tree about twenty meters away from the second blast, jumping around in fright. The fuse was hissing and smoking, and the situation was extremely urgent. At this critical moment, deputy brigade leader Liu Yujin remembered Chairman Mao's teaching, "To die for the people's interests is weightier than Mount Tai," and leaped with his sturdy body, jumping down from a cliff more than two meters high, and rushed over to untie the reins. A loud blast sounded, and stones flew horizontally. Liu Yujin pushed the frightened mule to the ground with all his might. Large stones whizzed past, and the mule escaped safely. The members unanimously praised Liu Yujin's fearless spirit and revolutionary daring. Liu Yujin said: "Chairman Mao saved me from the sea of bitterness and also let me receive training in the great school of Mao Zedong Thought in the People's Liberation Army. For the revolution, for socialism, even if I am torn to pieces and bleed to death, I will forever be loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao and forever loyal to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought."

    中国赫鲁晓夫之流挥舞“简单化”“庸俗化”等大棒，反对和污蔑工农兵群众活学活用毛主席著作。小汤山地区广大贫下中农，决心以活学活用毛主席著作的实际行动，回击中国赫鲁晓夫之流的污蔑。下面这一组小故事，就是射向中国赫鲁晓夫的一批炮弹。
    一轮红日照心中临危不惧见大勇
    今年四月，上庄公社海字大队第三生产队的社员和干部，在南山放炮开山，闸沟垫地。一次放炮，引线已经点燃了，二十多名社员跑出危险区。炮声响，飞石滚滚。忽然传来远处一队社员的喊声：“下边树上拴着我们的骡子！”这时，一头骡子已经扭断缰绳，向树林中飞奔，另一头骡子，还拴在距离第二炮二十几米远的杏树上，吓得乱蹦乱跳。导火线吱吱地冒着白烟，情况十分危急。就在这个紧迫时刻，副队长刘玉金想起毛主席“为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重”的教导，跃起健壮的身躯，跳下两米多高的陡壁，猛冲过去，解开缰绳。一声巨响，沙石横飞。刘玉金使劲把被惊吓的骡子拉倒在地，大块石头嗖嗖落在跟前，骡子安全脱险。社员们齐声赞扬刘玉金临危不惧，挺身而出的革命精神。刘玉金说：“毛主席把我救出了苦海，又让我在人民解放军这个毛泽东思想大学校里受过锻炼。为了革命，为了社会主义，就是粉身碎骨，流尽鲜血，我也要永远忠于伟大领袖毛主席，永远忠于战无不胜的毛泽东思想。”
