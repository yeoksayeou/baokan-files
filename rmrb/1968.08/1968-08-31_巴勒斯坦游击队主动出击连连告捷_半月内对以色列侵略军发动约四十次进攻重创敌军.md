Palestinian guerrillas have launched a series of successful offensives against Israeli aggressors, achieving significant victories in approximately forty attacks over the past half month.

According to the New China News Agency in Damascus, recent battle reports from "Fatah" (the Palestinian National Liberation Movement) and other Palestinian nationalist organizations indicate that the brave Palestinian guerrillas have continued their relentless attacks. From August 9th to the 23rd, over a span of fifteen days, they launched about forty attacks against Israeli aggressors, eliminating approximately two hundred enemy soldiers. During these operations, they also shot down one enemy helicopter, destroyed seven enemy strongholds, destroyed one tank and nearly thirty other vehicles, and blew up five sections of railway, one bridge, two power stations, and one factory.

Despite the Israeli aggressors significantly increasing their patrol forces, the Palestinian guerrillas have continued to launch proactive attacks. In areas such as the West Bank of the Jordan River, the Beisan Valley, the Gaza Strip, the Negev Desert, and various parts of Jerusalem, they have intensified their attacks on enemy forces, achieving major victories.

On August 12th, Palestinian guerrillas attacked an Israeli military stronghold near Ashdod Yagur in the Beisan Valley, killing or wounding ten enemy soldiers and destroying two half-track vehicles and one heavy machine gun. On the morning of the 13th, the guerrillas again attacked and destroyed several enemy military strongholds near Muzhaim in the Beisan Valley. They then engaged in a battle with hastily arriving Israeli reinforcements, destroying one tank and one half-track vehicle, killing or wounding twenty enemy soldiers, and safely retreated. On the night of the 14th, "Fatah" commando units attacked several Israeli military strongholds in the Beisan Valley at Mazra, Musa Mountain, and Um Tut, and after repelling a large number of Israeli reinforcements, destroyed these strongholds and a heavy mortar position, destroying two half-track vehicles and killing or wounding a large number of Israeli aggressors.

The guerrillas have also been active in the Negev Desert. On the night of August 9th, "Fatah" commandos attacked and annihilated an Israeli ambush force south of Fera in the Negev, and then used landmines to destroy a half-track vehicle sent by the aggressors as reinforcements, safely returning to their base.

Within the Israeli-occupied areas, railways, bridges, oil pipelines, power stations, and other facilities have been targets of Palestinian guerrilla attacks. From August 11th to the 14th, Palestinian guerrillas consecutively blew up sections of the oil pipeline from Eilat to Haifa and a section in the Negev Desert at Ras Hamra, damaged a section of railway and a bridge between Bir Hiba and Kana in the Negev Desert. In the Gaza Strip, Palestinian guerrillas consecutively used landmines to blow up several sections of railway near Gaza City and Khan Yunis, affecting the enemy's transportation and troop movements.

In Jerusalem, which is under strict Israeli control, Palestinian guerrillas launched four successful attacks on the night of August 18th, successfully blowing up a section of railway at the Jerusalem station, an Israeli military vehicle depot, and several vehicles, as well as a major bus station and a gas station. In these four explosions, ten Israeli aggressors were injured.

Following the August 9th bombing of a large power station near the U.S. Consulate in Jerusalem, "Fatah" guerrillas placed two bombs inside the U.S. Consulate courtyard on the 21st, damaging a building.

During this period, Palestinian guerrillas also used explosives to destroy the municipal building and checkpoints of the Israeli occupation authorities in Hebron.

The continuous victories of the Palestinian guerrillas have made the Israeli reactionary authorities very uneasy and angry. In retaliation, the Israeli aggressors have recently, in addition to heavily bombing the eastern bank of the Jordan River in Jordan, intensified large-scale persecution of the Palestinian people within the occupied areas, forcing large numbers of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and Jerusalem to leave their homes in an attempt to sever the connection and support between the Palestinian people and the guerrillas.

Reports indicate that since the 18th, Israeli aggressors have arrested approximately one hundred and thirty Palestinians in Jerusalem, Gaza, and Khan Yunis, and subjected them to severe torture. Israeli aggressors have also looted and destroyed dozens of shops in the Old City of Jerusalem.

On the 22nd, Arab people held large-scale demonstrations and a general strike and shutdown in the Old City of Jerusalem to protest against the atrocities of the Israeli aggressors. Including women, demonstrators marched and protested on the main streets of the Old City of Jerusalem until midnight.

    巴勒斯坦游击队主动出击连连告捷
    半月内对以色列侵略军发动约四十次进攻重创敌军
    据新华社大马士革电　据“法塔赫”（巴勒斯坦民族解放运动）和其他巴勒斯坦民族主义组织最近发表的战报，英勇的巴勒斯坦游击队再接再厉，从八月九日到二十三日的十五天中，又对以色列侵略军发动了约四十次进攻，歼灭敌军约二百名。在作战中，还击落敌军直升飞机一架，摧毁敌军据点七座，击毁敌军坦克一辆、各种车辆近三十辆，炸毁五段铁路、一座桥梁、两个发电站和一座工厂。
    在这期间，尽管以色列侵略军大量增加巡逻兵力，巴勒斯坦游击队还是不断地主动出击，在约旦河西岸、贝桑河谷、加沙地带、内格夫沙漠和耶路撒冷各地，加紧对敌军发动进攻，取得了重大的战果。
    八月十二日，巴勒斯坦游击队袭击了贝桑河谷的阿什多特雅戈夫附近的以色列军事据点，打死打伤敌军十人，击毁半履带式车两辆，重机关枪一挺。十三日清晨，游击队又在贝桑河谷的穆兹哈伊姆附近，袭击并摧毁了敌军的一些军事据点，接着他们又同匆匆赶到这个地区的以色列援军展开了战斗，结果击毁敌人一辆坦克和一辆半履带车，打死打伤敌军二十人，然后安全撤退。十四日夜，“法塔赫”突击队在贝桑河谷的马扎尔、穆萨山和乌姆图特袭击了一些以色列的军事据点，并在阻击了大批以色列援军后，摧毁了这些据点和一个重迫击炮阵地，击毁了两辆半履带式车辆，打死打伤大批以色列侵略军。
    游击队在内格夫沙漠也很活跃。八月九日晚上，“法塔赫”突击队在内格夫的费拉以南，袭击并歼灭了以色列的一支伏兵，接着又用地雷炸毁了侵略军派来增援的一辆半履带式车辆，安全地返回基地。
    以色列占领区内的铁路、桥梁、输油管、发电站等，都是巴勒斯坦游击队袭击的目标。八月十一日到十四日，巴勒斯坦游击队连续炸毁埃拉特通到海法的一段输油管和在内格夫沙漠的拉斯哈姆拉的一段输油管，破坏了内格夫沙漠比尔希巴与卡纳卜之间的一段铁路和一座桥梁。在加沙地带，巴勒斯坦游击队连续用地雷炸毁加沙市和汉尤尼斯附近的几段铁路，使敌人的交通运输和军队调动受到影响。
    在以色列侵略军控制很严的耶路撒冷市，巴勒斯坦游击队在八月十八日晚发动了四次袭击，成功地炸毁耶路撒冷车站的一段铁路、以色列的一个军用车辆站和一些车辆，还炸毁了一个主要汽车站和一个加油站。在这四次爆炸中，有十名以色列侵略军被炸伤。
    继八月九日炸毁耶路撒冷美国领事馆附近的一座大型发电站以后，“法塔赫”游击队二十一日又在美国领事馆的院内放了两颗炸弹，炸坏一座建筑物。
    在这一期间，巴勒斯坦游击队还用爆炸物炸毁了哈利勒市的以色列占领当局的市政大楼和关卡。
    巴勒斯坦游击队的不断胜利出击，使以色列反动当局十分不安和恼怒。为了进行报复，以色列侵略军最近除了对约旦河东岸的约旦领土进行狂轰滥炸以外，还加紧对占领区内的巴勒斯坦人民进行大规模的迫害，强迫加沙地带和耶路撒冷等地的大批巴勒斯坦人离开他们的家园，妄想以此割断巴勒斯坦人民和巴勒斯坦游击队的联系和对游击队的支持。
    据报道，从十八日以来，以色列侵略军在耶路撒冷、加沙和汉尤尼斯三地就逮捕了大约一百三十名巴勒斯坦人，并对他们进行严刑拷打。以色列侵略军还洗劫和捣毁了耶路撒冷旧城内的几十家商店。
    二十二日，阿拉伯人民在耶路撒冷旧城举行大规模示威和总罢工、罢市，抗议以色列侵略军的暴行。包括妇女在内的示威者在耶路撒冷旧城的主要街道上游行示威到半夜。
