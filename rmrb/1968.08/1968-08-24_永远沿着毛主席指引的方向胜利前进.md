The proletarian headquarters, with Chairman Mao at its core and Vice Chairman Lin at his side, is the sole leadership center for the entire Party, the entire army, the entire nation, and all revolutionary masses. Reflecting on the more than two years of struggle in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we deeply feel that by following this leadership center, we have direction and can achieve one victory after another; if we deviate even slightly from this leadership center, we will lose our way, and the revolution will suffer setbacks and failures. To closely follow this leadership center, we must eliminate all kinds of interference from various sides. In the course of following the battle cry of the proletarian headquarters with Chairman Mao at its core and Vice Chairman Lin at his side, we have encountered several significant instances of interference from the right or the ultra-left. Each time we eliminate an interference and achieve a victory, our understanding of closely following the leadership center of the proletarian headquarters with Chairman Mao at its core is elevated, and our resolve to follow this leadership center becomes even firmer.

We must unite around the proletarian headquarters with Chairman Mao at its core and Vice Chairman Lin at his side, and fight under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. Last February, soon after the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of Zhaozhou County, some revolutionary mass organizations, influenced by anarchist tendencies, saw that there was no seat for them in the core of the Revolutionary Committee and, ignoring the battle cry of the proletarian headquarters, put forward the erroneous slogan of "Zhaozhou must be in chaos again." This temporarily led some revolutionary masses astray and caused them to deviate from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. At that time, we believed that if this trend were allowed to continue, it would not only hinder the consolidation of the newly established Revolutionary Committee but also seriously disrupt Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. We promptly organized the broad revolutionary masses to repeatedly study the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings on "the necessity to guide the petty-bourgeois ideology within our ranks onto the track of the proletarian revolution. This is a key issue for the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," raising their revolutionary spirit and strengthening their proletarian organizational discipline, ensuring the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest directive on establishing "three-in-one" revolutionary committees. The broad revolutionary masses said: Anarchism is the great enemy of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the great enemy of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the great enemy of fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest directives. With anarchism, there is no proletarian sense of unity, no proletarian organizational discipline, and it is certain that one will fall behind the times and deviate from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. If one acts cleverly and does not take the right path but takes the wrong path, one will surely lose one's way and make big mistakes.

The proletarian headquarters with Chairman Mao at its core and Vice Chairman Lin at his side is the locomotive of historical progress, representing the revolutionary will and fundamental interests of the proletariat. We proletarian revolutionary fighters must resolutely support and bravely defend this leadership center. With this leadership center, our cause will develop, and the revolution will be victorious; without this leadership center, our revolutionary ranks will become disorganized, discipline will slacken, political vigilance will be lost, and we will have ears that cannot distinguish right from wrong and eyes that cannot see the class enemy. Last summer, just as the newly established Revolutionary Committee was leading the people of the entire county to implement Chairman Mao's series of latest directives and launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism, some people within the ranks of the revolutionary masses, due to the influence of bourgeois individualism and factionalism, became arrogant again; instead of benevolently criticizing the shortcomings and errors that appeared in the growth process of the newly established Revolutionary Committee and helping it to develop and improve continuously, they stood on the bourgeois standpoint, "with myself as the core," formed factions, and caused disintegration. In this situation, the standing committee members of the Revolutionary Committee, following the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction to "you must put politics in command, go among the masses, be with the masses, and make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution even better," went among the masses, on the one hand propagating the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest directives, and on the other hand checking the shortcomings and errors in the work, listening to the opinions of the masses. Those who wanted to form their own factions finally recognized their mistakes. Practice tells us: Using Mao Zedong Thought to reform non-proletarian ideology is the fundamental task of all work. The most important and fundamental thing for us proletarian revolutionaries to seize power is to seize the power to spread Mao Zedong Thought.

To forever march forward in victory along the path indicated by the proletarian headquarters with Chairman Mao at its core, we must closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, seriously implement each of Chairman Mao's latest directives, and do as Chairman Mao says, execute as Chairman Mao instructs, and deploy as Chairman Mao deploys. Closeness means victory. In February this year, a handful of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist-roaders, and untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in our county, under the banner of "rehabilitation," stirred up a counter-revolutionary wind of reversing correct verdicts. They used counter-revolutionary two-faced tactics to temporarily deceive some of the masses, directing their spears at the great People's Liberation Army of China and the newly established Revolutionary Committee, attempting to reverse the direction of the struggle and seize back their "paradise" that they had lost. To thoroughly smash this counter-revolutionary wind of reversing correct verdicts, we closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, used Mao Zedong Thought to propagate among the masses, organize the masses, and arm the masses, thoroughly exposed the cover of class struggle, and made everyone's mind more firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly grasp the key of class struggle, and act in accordance with Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Mao Zedong Thought, when grasped by the broad masses, becomes an inexhaustible force and an extremely powerful spiritual atomic bomb. With Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon, the broad revolutionary masses carried out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism, actively and unceasingly launched fierce attacks on the class enemy, and thoroughly smashed the counter-revolutionary restoration plot of a handful of class enemies.

The more than two years of struggle in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have made us realize that both the "multi-center is no center" theory and the "self-centered" idea are bourgeois trash. Some people in our revolutionary ranks fell for the "multi-center is no center" theory precisely because the "I" in their minds became inflated, not knowing how high the sky is or how thick the earth is. If this erroneous tendency is not immediately corrected and allowed to develop, it will slide into a dangerous pit.

"The ship sails with the helmsman, and the revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." Forever being loyal to the proletarian headquarters with Chairman Mao at its core and Vice Chairman Lin at his side is the fundamental guarantee for achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In the struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must closely follow the great strategic deployment of the great leader Chairman Mao, use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, thoroughly criticize the reactionary bourgeois "multi-center is no center" theory, and under the battle cry of the proletarian headquarters with Chairman Mao at its core and Vice Chairman Lin at his side, unify our thinking, unify our steps, and unify our actions, forever marching forward in victory along the path indicated by the proletarian headquarters with Chairman Mao at its core.

    永远沿着毛主席指引的方向胜利前进
    沈阳部队活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子黑龙江省肇州县革命委员会主任、武装部政委  田玉和
    以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，是全党、全军、全国和广大革命群众唯一的领导中心。回顾两年多来无产阶级文化大革命的战斗历程，使我们深深体会到，紧跟这个领导中心，就有方向，就会取得一个又一个的胜利；稍一离开这个领导中心，就要转向，革命就要遭受挫折和失败。要想紧紧跟上这个领导中心，必须排除来自各个方面的干扰。在紧跟以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的战斗号令中，我们先后遇到了几次比较大的来自右的或极“左”方面的干扰。每排除一次干扰，每取得一次胜利，都把我们对紧跟以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部这个领导中心的认识提高一步，紧跟这个领导中心的决心更加坚强。
    我们就是要团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的周围，战斗在毛泽东思想的伟大红旗下。去年二月份，我们肇州县革命委员会刚一成立，在革命队伍里，由于无政府主义思潮的影响，有的革命群众组织，看到革命委员会核心中没有自己的席位，就无视无产阶级司令部的战斗号令，提出“肇州必须第二次大乱”的错误口号，一时把部分革命群众引向了邪路，背离了毛主席的革命路线。当时我们认为，这种思想任其发展下去，不仅会妨害新生的革命委员会的巩固，而且会严重地干扰毛主席的伟大战略部署。我们及时地组织广大革命群众反复学习伟大领袖毛主席关于“必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道，这是无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的一个关键问题”的教导，提高了革命性，增强了无产阶级的组织纪律性，保证了毛主席关于建立“三结合”的革命委员会最新指示的落实。广大革命群众说：无政府主义是无产阶级文化大革命的大敌，是无产阶级专政的大敌，是全面落实毛主席最新指示的大敌。有了无政府主义，就没有无产阶级的整体观念，就没有无产阶级的组织纪律，就一定会跟不上时代的步伐，背离毛主席的革命路线。如果自作聪明，正路不走走邪路，就一定会迷失方向，犯大错误。
    以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，是历史前进的火车头，代表了无产阶级的革命意志和根本利益。我们无产阶级革命战士对这个领导中心，就是要坚决拥护，勇敢捍卫。有了这个领导中心，我们的事业就发展，革命就胜利；离开这个领导中心，我们革命队伍就会组织涣散，纪律松弛，在政治上丧失警惕，有耳听不出是非，有眼看不见阶级敌人。去年夏天，正当新生的革命委员会率领全县人民落实毛主席一系列最新指示、掀起革命大批判新高潮的时候，在无产阶级革命派内部，有的人由于资产阶级个人主义、山头主义作怪，头脑又膨胀起来；对于新生的革命委员会在成长过程中出现的缺点和错误，不是善意地提出批评，帮助它不断地发展和完善，而是站在资产阶级的立场上，“以我为核心”，拉山头，搞分散。在这种情况下，我们革命委员会常委们遵照伟大领袖毛主席“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好”的教导，分头到群众中去，一面宣传落实毛主席的最新指示，一面检查工作中的缺点和错误，听取群众的意见。那些想另立山头的人终于认识了自己的错误。实践告诉我们：用毛泽东思想改造非无产阶级思想，这是一切工作的根本。我们无产阶级革命派掌权，最重要、最根本的就是掌普及毛泽东思想的权。
    要永远沿着以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部指引的方向胜利前进，就要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，认真执行毛主席的每一个最新指示，做到毛主席怎么说，我们就怎么做，毛主席怎么指示，我们就怎么执行，毛主席怎么部署，我们就怎么紧跟。紧跟就是胜利。今年二月份，我县一小撮叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，打着“平反”的旗号，刮起了一股反革命翻案妖风。他们采用反革命两面手法，一时蒙蔽了一部分群众，把矛头指向伟大的中国人民解放军，指向新生的革命委员会，妄图扭转斗争大方向，夺回他们失去的
  “天堂”。为了彻底粉碎这股翻案妖风，我们紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，用毛泽东思想宣传群众，组织群众，武装群众，大揭阶级斗争盖子，使每个人头脑里更高地升起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧紧抓住阶级斗争这条纲，行动不离毛主席的革命路线。毛泽东思想为广大群众所掌握，就变成了无穷无尽的力量，变成了威力无比的精神原子弹。广大革命群众以毛泽东思想为武器，深入持久地开展革命的大批判，主动地不停顿地向阶级敌人发起猛烈进攻，彻底粉碎了一小撮阶级敌人的反革命复辟阴谋。
    两年多来无产阶级文化大革命的斗争实践使我们认识到，“多中心即无中心论”和“以我为中心”都是资产阶级的破烂货。我们革命队伍中有些人之所以上了“多中心论”的当，就是因为头脑里的“我”字膨胀起来，不知天多高，地多厚。这种错误倾向如不立即纠正，任其发展下去，就会滑到危险的泥坑里去。
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”永远忠于以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的根本保证。我们一定要在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的战斗中，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的伟大战略部署，以毛泽东思想为武器，彻底批判反动的资产阶级的“多中心即无中心论”，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的战斗号令下，统一认识，统一步伐，统一行动，永远沿着以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部指引的方向胜利前进。
