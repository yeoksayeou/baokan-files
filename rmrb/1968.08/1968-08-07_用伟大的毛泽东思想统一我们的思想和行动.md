On the occasion of the second anniversary of the publication of our great leader Chairman Mao's historic big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters," as we review the great victories of the Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao, we deeply feel that following the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin is victory. This is the great truth of our era and the unshakable belief of our hundreds of millions of revolutionary people.

In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary workers of our factory, under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's great historical document "Bombard the Headquarters," have seized back the leadership power usurped by a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. Our workers-turned-engineering and technical personnel and other revolutionary engineering and technical personnel have become the masters of scientific research and technological design. Our great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the proletarian education revolution affirm our factory's path of "cultivating technical personnel from among the workers," giving our revolutionary workers the greatest support, encouragement, and impetus, and the greatest education. From the bottom of our hearts, we burst out with the words: "All our achievements are due to our great leader Chairman Mao! All our victories are the great victories of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!"

Vice Chairman Lin said: "This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has the highest commander, our Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao is the commander-in-chief. Under the command of our great commander, if we listen well to our commander-in-chief—Chairman Mao—then the Cultural Revolution will surely develop smoothly and achieve great victories!" To listen to Chairman Mao means to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought actively, to link theory with practice, and to ensure that words and deeds are consistent. To listen to Chairman Mao means to unite our wills, steps, and actions under the orders of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, to unite as one, and to fight the enemy together. To listen to Chairman Mao means to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments and to carry out Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions without any deviation. In the more than two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, countless facts have proven that by seriously reading Chairman Mao's books, resolutely listening to Chairman Mao's words, and completely following Chairman Mao's instructions, and by resolutely carrying out the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters, we can achieve one victory after another. When our entire factory's revolutionary masses achieved revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, a handful of class enemies hid in dark corners, spreading poisonous winds and setting off ghostly fires, attempting to incite some people to split and set up another faction. However, because our factory's revolutionary masses resolutely listened to Chairman Mao's words, closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, united our wills, steps, and actions, we promptly exposed the class enemies' plots and tricks, achieving double victories in revolution and production.

Revolutionary struggles have educated us, making us realize that ideas like "with me as the core" and "multi-centerism" are all reactionary bourgeois thoughts and theories. They disperse the unity of the revolutionary ranks based on Mao Zedong Thought and hinder the implementation of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We proletarian revolutionaries must resolutely criticize "multi-centerism" and all bourgeois thoughts. We must unite more closely around the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. We will resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's words and the orders of the proletarian headquarters. Whatever Chairman Mao advocates, we will resolutely do; whatever Chairman Mao praises, we will resolutely learn; whatever Chairman Mao criticizes, we will resolutely change; whatever Chairman Mao opposes, we will resolutely fight. We, the revolutionary workers of the entire factory, are determined to further unite our thoughts and actions with Mao Zedong Thought, to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, and to make the greatest efforts to achieve comprehensive victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

　　用伟大的毛泽东思想统一我们的思想和行动
　　上海市活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子、上海机床厂革命委员会负责人　张梅华
    在纪念我们伟大领袖毛主席具有划时代意义的大字报《炮打司令部》发表两周年的日子里，回顾毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命运动节节胜利的伟大历程，我们从心底里深深感到：紧跟以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部就是胜利，这是我们时代的伟大真理，也是我们亿万革命群众无比坚定的信念。
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，我们厂革命职工在毛主席《炮打司令部》这一伟大历史文献的光辉照耀下，夺回了被党内一小撮走资派所窃取的领导大权，我们工人出身的工程技术人员和其他革命的工程技术人员成了科学研究和技术设计的主人。我们伟大领袖毛主席最近发出的关于无产阶级教育革命的最新指示，肯定了我们厂“从工人中培养技术人员的道路”，给了我厂革命职工最大的支持，最大的鼓舞，最大的鞭策，最大的教育。全厂革命职工从心底里迸发出一句话：“我们的一切成就，都归功于伟大领袖毛主席！我们的一切胜利，都是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！”
    林副主席说：“这次无产阶级文化大革命，最高司令是我们毛主席。毛主席是统帅。我们在伟大统帅的指挥下，好好地听我们统帅——毛主席的话，文化大革命一定能顺利发展，一定能取得伟大胜利！”听毛主席的话，就要活学活用毛泽东思想，理论联系实际，言行一致。听毛主席的话，就要在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的号令下统一意志，统一步伐，统一行动，团结一致，共同对敌。听毛主席的话，就要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席的一系列最新指示。在两年多来的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，无数事实证明，认真读毛主席的书，坚决听毛主席的话，完全照毛主席的指示办事，坚决执行无产阶级司令部的战斗号令，就能取得一个又一个的胜利。我们厂在全厂革命群众实现革命大联合和革命三结合的时候，一小撮阶级敌人躲在阴暗角落里，煽阴风，点鬼火，妄图煽动一些人闹分裂，另立山头。但是，由于我们厂革命群众坚决听毛主席的话，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，统一意志，统一步伐，统一行动，及时戳穿了阶级敌人的阴谋诡计，取得了革命和生产的双胜利。
    革命斗争的实践教育了我们，使我们认识到，什么“以我为核心”，什么“多中心论”，都是资产阶级的反动思想、反动理论。它涣散革命队伍在毛泽东思想基础上的团结，妨碍毛主席无产阶级革命路线的贯彻执行。我们无产阶级革命派必须坚决批判“多中心论”和一切资产阶级思想。我们要更加紧密地团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的周围。毛主席的话，无产阶级司令部的号令，我们坚决执行。凡是毛主席提倡的，我们坚决去做；凡是毛主席表扬的，我们坚决去学；凡是毛主席批评的，我们坚决地改；凡是毛主席反对的，我们坚决地斗。我们全厂革命职工，决心进一步用毛泽东思想统一思想和行动，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利做出最大的努力。
