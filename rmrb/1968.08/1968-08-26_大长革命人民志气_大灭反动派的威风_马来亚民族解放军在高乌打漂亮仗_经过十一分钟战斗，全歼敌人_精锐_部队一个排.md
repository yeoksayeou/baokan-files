The Malayan People's National Liberation Army Fights a Brilliant Battle at Kau U

After an eleven-minute battle, the entire enemy "elite" platoon was annihilated

New China News Agency, August 25th

On the eve of the 20th anniversary of the Malayan people's anti-British national liberation war, a platoon of the Malayan People's National Liberation Army, on the afternoon of June 17th, fought a brilliant ambush battle near the important military stronghold of Kau U in the northern part of Perak State, held by the British imperialists and the Rahman group. They achieved a glorious victory by annihilating the so-called "elite" troops of the British imperialists and the Rahman group—a platoon of the so-called "police field force" of the third company, second platoon, which had received special anti-guerrilla training and was well-equipped. The battle resulted in the annihilation of 35 enemy personnel.

As soon as the battle began, the liberation army soldiers opened fire with fierce intensity. Twenty seconds later, the soldiers launched a charge, bravely rushing towards the enemy and engaging in fierce combat. Under the clever and brave assault of the soldiers, the enemy's so-called "elite" troops were thrown into confusion. The battle was basically over in eleven minutes. The liberation army killed 15 enemies on the spot, including three pseudo-police sergeants, and captured 20 enemies, including the platoon leader and deputy platoon leader. Among the captives, 18 were wounded.

The liberation army soldiers have always strictly followed the policy of treating prisoners of war humanely. They applied medicine to the wounded captives, conducted propaganda among them, and then released them.

In this battle, the liberation army seized 25 guns, including two light machine guns, 18 automatic rifles, three submachine guns, and two pistols. They also seized 1,000 rounds of ammunition and a batch of military supplies, and destroyed three enemy vehicles.

This inspiring victory greatly crushed the enemy's arrogance and dealt a heavy blow to the deceptive propaganda of the British imperialists and the Rahman group. In order to serve their counter-revolutionary needs, the British imperialists and their lackeys have repeatedly fabricated lies, claiming that the "Malayan emergency has ended" and that the "Malayan Communist Party-led guerrilla forces no longer exist," and so on. The battle at Kau U exposed these lies and gave them a resounding slap in the face.

As soon as the battle began, the pseudo-police headquarters in Kuala Lumpur immediately ordered all state pseudo-police chiefs to be on "alert" via radio. However, the pseudo-military police in the nearby Kau U stronghold dared not come out to reinforce. Within just over ten days after the battle, the second-in-command of the Rahman puppet group, the pseudo-defense minister Razak, hurriedly convened two pseudo-cabinet meetings. On one hand, they decided to establish the so-called "West Malaysian" military region headquarters and hastily deploy troops to strengthen "mopping-up" operations. On the other hand, he personally took action, running around, feigning calm, trying to "pacify" the people, and eliminate the chaos and fear within the puppet group and among their followers. However, this was all in vain, because even Razak himself could not hide his panic. He stammered, saying one moment that the "situation is under our control," and the next moment that the "Communist Party has armed forces, armed work teams, and sympathizers everywhere," and that the "situation has become so serious that it must be handled by the military," and so on.

The battle at Kau U greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary people. This brilliant battle fully demonstrated the flexible and mobile tactics and the brave and swift combat style of the Malayan People's National Liberation Army, greatly encouraging the fighting determination and confidence of people of all ethnic groups. After hearing the news of this victory, the broad masses of people were overjoyed and clapped their hands in approval. They eagerly spread the news, celebrating the liberation army's glorious victory together. They told the soldiers, "You fought well! Keep it up!" They believed that the "June 17th" victory was like a bomb, "blowing the Rahman puppet group into a state of chaos." They also expressed their firm belief that, despite the frenzied intensification of "mopping-up" operations by the British and American imperialists and their lackeys, the Rahman-Lee Kuan Yew group, the Malayan People's National Liberation Army, with its glorious revolutionary tradition, will certainly smash all the enemy's counter-revolutionary "mopping-up" operations and grow stronger in battle!

    大长革命人民志气　大灭反动派的威风
    马来亚民族解放军在高乌打漂亮仗
    经过十一分钟战斗，全歼敌人“精锐”部队一个排
    新华社二十五日讯在马来亚人民抗英民族解放战争二十周年前夕，马来亚民族解放军的一个排，于六月十七日下午在霹雳州北部英帝国主义—拉赫曼集团的重要军事据点高乌附近，打了一个漂亮的伏击战，取得了全歼英帝—拉赫曼集团的“精锐”部队——受过反游击战特别训练、装备优良的所谓“警察野战部队”第三连第二排——共三十五人的辉煌胜利。
    战斗一开始，民族解放军战士就以猛烈的火力向敌人射击。二十秒钟后，战士们就发起冲锋，勇猛地向敌人扑去，同敌人展开激烈的搏斗。在战士们机智勇猛的冲杀下，敌人的所谓“精锐”部队被打得晕头转向，十一分钟就基本解决战斗。解放军当场打死敌人十五名，其中包括三名伪警察下士，俘虏敌人正排长和副排长等二十名，其中有十八名被打伤。
    解放军战士一贯坚决执行优待俘虏的政策。他们给受伤的俘虏敷药，对俘虏进行宣传，然后将俘虏释放。
    在这一战斗中，解放军缴获了二十五支枪，其中有轻机枪二挺、自动步枪十八支、冲锋枪三支、手枪两支，还缴获了一千发子弹和一批军用物资，毁坏敌人军车三辆。
    这一振奋人心的胜利大灭了敌人的威风，沉重地打击了英帝—拉赫曼集团的欺骗宣传。英帝及其走狗为了其反革命的需要，一再制造谎言，说什么“马来亚紧急状态结束了”，“马来亚共产党领导的游击队已不存在了”，等等。高乌的战斗宣告了这种谎言的破产，打了它们一记响亮的耳光。
    战斗一打响，吉隆坡伪警察总部立即通过无线电命令各州伪警长马上“戒备”。但是，近在咫尺的高乌据点里的伪军警却不敢出来增援。战斗发生后的短短十多天内，拉赫曼傀儡集团的第二号头目伪国防部长拉扎克连忙召集两次伪内阁会议，一方面决定成立所谓西“马来西亚”军区司令部，慌忙部署兵力，加强“清剿”行动；另一方面，他亲自出马，东奔西跑，故作镇静，企图“安抚人心”，消除傀儡集团内部和它们的追随者的混乱和恐惧。可是，这毕竟是徒劳的，因为连拉扎克自己也掩盖不住自己的慌乱。他语无伦次地一会儿说什么“局势已经在我方控制之下”，一会儿又说“共产党有武装部队，有武装工作队，还到处有同情者”，“局势已经严重到必须由军方去处理的地步了”，等等。
    高乌的战斗，大长了革命人民的志气。这个漂亮的战斗充分显示了马来亚民族解放军灵活机动的战术和勇敢神速的战斗风格，大大鼓舞了各族人民的斗争决心和信心。广大人民听到了这个捷报之后，无不欢欣鼓舞，拍手称快。他们纷纷奔走相告，共庆解放军这个辉煌的胜利。他们向战士们说：“你们打得好！再接再厉！”他们认为“六·一七”捷报象一枚炸弹，“炸得拉赫曼傀儡集团一片慌乱”。他们还表示深信，尽管英美帝国主义及其走狗拉赫曼—李光耀集团疯狂加紧“围剿”，具有光荣革命传统的马来亚民族解放军必将粉碎敌人一切反革命“围剿”，并在战斗中越打越强！
