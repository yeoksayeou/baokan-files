On the morning of April 2nd, a fiery red sun rose from the east. On the railway line from Shenyang to Tonghua in Northeast China, the 269th ordinary passenger train, filled with passengers, rushed forward under the melody of "The East is Red," greeting the dawn.

The train passed through several stations and slowly came to a stop at the San Yuanpu Station. At this time, two sweaty soldiers came to request the train to wait for a moment to quickly transport thirteen injured soldiers from a certain unit, who were injured while extinguishing a mountain fire, to Tonghua for treatment.

Upon receiving the news, the train conductor immediately thought of the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings on "supporting the army and loving the people," and decided to do everything possible to rush the injured soldiers to the hospital. After reporting to his superiors, he decided to stop the train and immediately transport the injured soldiers.

The news spread quickly, and the entire train was mobilized. The crew members immediately sprang into action, dividing tasks to prepare everything; passengers voluntarily gave up their seats to make room; the news reached the dining car, and the cooks immediately prepared delicious food for the injured soldiers. The locomotive crew actively prepared for the journey. The train inspectors repeatedly and meticulously checked the vehicles to ensure the absolute safety of the train's operation.

Everyone shared the urgency of the soldiers, thought about what the soldiers needed, and helped them. At this time, someone suggested: to quickly send the injured soldiers to the hospital, convert the 269th ordinary passenger train into an express train and head straight to Tonghua. What a great suggestion! After reporting, the superiors immediately approved it. However, there were three stations ahead where the train could not stop. What about the passengers who needed to get off at these three stations? The crew members immediately went to each car to explain to the passengers who needed to get off at these three stations, suggesting they get off at this station and wait for three hours to take the 503rd mixed train. The passengers unanimously said: "Good! As long as the soldiers can get to the hospital on time, we are willing to wait not just three hours, but even three days." All of this fully demonstrated the broad revolutionary masses' deep love for the People's Liberation Army, which was personally created and led by the great leader Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin Biao!

With a long whistle, the temporary express train carrying thirteen injured soldiers set off like lightning. Thanks to the efforts of all the crew members and the cooperation of the passengers, this temporary express train finally arrived in Tonghua twenty-six minutes earlier than the scheduled time.

　　在临时特快列车上
    四月二日早晨，一轮火红的太阳从东方喷薄升起。在我国东北沈阳到通化的铁路线上，二六九次普通旅客列车满载着旅客，迎着万道霞光，在《东方红》乐曲声中，向前奔驰。
    列车经过了一个个车站，在三元浦车站缓缓停了下来。这时，有两名汗流浃背的解放军同志前来请求列车稍候片刻，以便把解放军某部因扑灭山火而受伤的十三名战士迅速地运往通化治疗。
    列车长得到消息，立即想到伟大领袖毛主席关于“拥军爱民”的教导，决心千方百计抢运受伤的解放军同志。他请示上级以后，决定把车停下来，立刻抢运解放军伤员。
    消息一传开，整个列车都动员起来了。乘务员立即全部出动，分头做好各项准备工作；旅客们纷纷让出席位，腾出地方；消息传到餐车里，炊事员马上为伤员做好可口的饮食。机车室的人员积极做好一切行车准备工作。列车检查人员一遍又一遍地周密检查车辆，以确保列车运行的绝对安全。
    大家都急解放军所急，想解放军所想，帮解放军所需。这时，有人提出：为了将伤员尽快地送到医院，把二六九次普通客车变成特快列车，直达通化。这个建议多么好啊！经过请示，上级立刻批准了。可是前边有三个站不能停车，在这三个站下车的旅客怎么办？乘务员们立即分头到各车厢去，向在这三个站下车的旅客做工作，建议他们提前在本站下车，等三个小时后换乘五○三次混合列车。旅客们异口同声地说：“好！只要解放军同志能及时入院，别说等三个小时，就是等三天我们也心甘情愿。”这一切充分表明了广大革命群众对伟大领袖毛主席亲手缔造、亲自领导，林彪副主席直接指挥的人民解放军的无比热爱！
    “呜——”一声长鸣，载着十三名解放军伤员的临时特快列车风驰电掣般地出发了。由于全体乘务员的努力和旅客的协助，这趟临时特快列车终于比正常时间提早二十六分钟安全到达了通化。
