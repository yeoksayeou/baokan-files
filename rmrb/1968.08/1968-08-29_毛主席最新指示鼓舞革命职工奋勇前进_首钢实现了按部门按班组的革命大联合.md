The great leader Chairman Mao's warm reception of the capital's workers' representatives and the publication of Chairman Mao's latest directive have greatly educated and inspired the revolutionary workers of the Capital Iron and Steel Company. They have turned Chairman Mao's concern into a powerful force, with the selfless heroism of the working class, fiercely criticizing the reactionary bourgeoisie's "multi-center means no center" theory, and achieving revolutionary unity by department and by workgroup.

The struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads at the Capital Iron and Steel Company is extremely sharp, complex, and intense. The revolutionary unity at the Capital Iron and Steel Company has undergone a tortuous process due to the sabotage of class enemies and the influence of bourgeois factionalism. Recently, the great leader Chairman Mao issued a directive: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully give play to the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in all work. The working class should also constantly raise its political awareness in the struggle." Chairman Mao's latest directive has inspired all the revolutionary workers of the company. Under the guidance of the supporting troops, they have seriously studied and deeply understood it, linking it with the excellent revolutionary situation in the country and Beijing, and deeply realizing that bourgeois mountaineering, cliquism, and individualism seriously disrupt the unity of the revolutionary ranks on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, interfere with the great strategic deployment of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, which is absolutely intolerable to the working class. Revolutionary workers have stood up to criticize mountaineering, individualism, and cliquism, and the two-faced hypocritical bad style. They say: Chairman Mao is heart to heart with us workers. We workers must be absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, absolutely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The working class can only unite around the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and under the command of Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters, unite in thought, unite in action, and unite in action, in order to fully give play to the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in all work. With deep proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, revolutionary workers have put forward the need to follow Chairman Mao's great teachings and achieve revolutionary unity by factory, department, workshop, and workgroup. Revolutionary workers pointed out: the working class can only hold high one banner, which is to forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. The working class can only be one faction, which is the revolutionary faction of the proletariat. The working class has only one center in its heart, which is the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. We must advance on the road indicated by the proletarian headquarters.

The supporting troops comrades, together with some workers who have serious mountaineering and individualistic thoughts, studied Chairman Mao's latest directive, deeply understood Chairman Mao's teaching on "the working class should also constantly raise its political awareness in the struggle," and made them realize that the rightist splittist "multi-center means no center" theory is a bourgeois thought, not a working-class thought. The working class can only study and apply Chairman Mao's works, arm itself with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, constantly raise its class struggle and line struggle awareness, break down the "self" and establish the "public," thoroughly eliminate the influence of bourgeois thought, and not disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations for the working class. Only then can the working class fully play its leading role in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in all work.

After the criticism of bourgeois mountaineering, individualism, and cliquism, the revolutionary workers, with a thorough revolutionary spirit, firmly proposed to sever all relations with various small factions. In five days, all the dozens of factories and departments and thousands of workgroups in the company have fully achieved revolutionary unity.

Now, the revolutionary workers of various factories and departments of the Capital Iron and Steel Company are advancing victoriously and are actively preparing to establish revolutionary committees and revolutionary leading groups.

    毛主席最新指示鼓舞革命职工奋勇前进
    首钢实现了按部门按班组的革命大联合
    首钢革命职工深刻地认识到，右倾分裂主义的“多中心即无中心论”是资产阶级思想，不是工人阶级的思想。工人阶级只有活学活用毛主席著作，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，不断提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，彻底清除资产阶级思想的影响，才能不辜负毛主席对工人阶级的期望，工人阶级才能在文化大革命中和一切工作中充分发挥领导作用。
    新华社二十八日讯　伟大领袖毛主席亲切接见首都工人阶级代表和毛主席最新指示的发表，极大地教育和鼓舞了首都钢铁公司的广大革命职工。他们把毛主席的亲切关怀，化为巨大的动力，以工人阶级大公无私的英雄气概，狠狠地批判了反动的资产阶级的“多中心论”，按厂、处、车间、班组实现了革命大联合。
    首都钢铁公司两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争极其尖锐、复杂、激烈。首钢的革命大联合，由于阶级敌人的破坏和资产阶级派性的影响，经历了曲折的道路。最近，伟大领袖毛主席发出指示：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”毛主席的最新指示，鼓舞了全公司的革命职工。他们在支左解放军的帮助下，认真学习，深刻领会，联系全国和北京市的一片大好革命形势，深深地认识到资产阶级山头主义、宗派主义、个人主义严重地涣散革命队伍在毛泽东思想基础上的团结，干扰了以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的伟大战略部署，这是工人阶级绝对不能容忍的。广大革命职工纷纷起来批判山头主义、个人主义和宗派主义，批判阳奉阴违的两面派坏作风。他们说：毛主席同我们工人阶级心连心，我们工人阶级要无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的革命路线。工人阶级只有团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的周围，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在毛主席的无产阶级司令部的号令下，统一认识，统一步伐，统一行动，才能充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。广大革命职工怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情，纷纷提出要遵照毛主席的伟大教导，按厂、处、车间和班组实现革命大联合。革命职工们指出：工人阶级只能高举一面旗帜，就是要永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。工人阶级只能是一派，这就是无产阶级革命派。工人阶级心中只有一个中心，这就是以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部。我们要按无产阶级司令部指引的道路前进。
    支左解放军同志同少数山头主义、个人主义思想比较严重的职工一起学习毛主席的最新指示，深刻领会毛主席关于“工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟”的教导，使他们认识到，右倾分裂主义的“多中心即无中心论”是资产阶级思想，不是工人阶级的思想。工人阶级只有活学活用毛主席著作，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，不断提高阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，彻底清除资产阶级思想的影响，才能不辜负毛主席对工人阶级的期望，工人阶级才能在文化大革命中和一切工作中充分发挥领导作用。
    资产阶级山头主义、个人主义和宗派主义遭到批判之后，广大革命职工以彻底革命的精神，坚决提出同各个小山头脱离一切关系。全公司几十个厂、处和上千个班组，在五天之内全部实现了革命大联合。
    现在，首都钢铁公司各工厂、各部门的广大革命职工，正乘胜前进，纷纷酝酿建立革命委员会和革命领导小组。
