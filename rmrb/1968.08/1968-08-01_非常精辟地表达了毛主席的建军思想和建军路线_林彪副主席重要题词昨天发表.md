	The important inscription by Vice Chairman Lin Biao for the special stamp "People's Liberation Army" issued by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications in 1965 has been published today.

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated July 31, the great leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, inscribed a special stamp "People's Liberation Army" issued by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications on July 26, 1965. This inscription was published today on the commemorative stamp for the 41st anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army.

	The full text of the inscription is:

	"The People's Liberation Army is a force armed with Mao Zedong Thought, a force that serves the people wholeheartedly, and therefore an invincible force.

	Lin Biao
	July 26, 1965"

	Vice Chairman Lin's inscription is extremely important and accurately expresses Chairman Mao's military thoughts and military line.

	In 1965, on the eve of the 38th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army, the revolutionary cultural workers of the People's Liberation Army and the revolutionary masses of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, under the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao to "learn from the People's Liberation Army throughout the country," designed a set of stamps that depict the People's Liberation Army's active study and application of Chairman Mao's works, emphasizing proletarian politics, adhering to the Four Firsts, promoting the Three-Eight Style, advocating the Three Great Democracies, and carrying out the movement to create four good companies. Vice Chairman Lin inscribed this set of stamps. The agent of the Chinese Khrushchev in the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications maliciously suppressed and blocked Vice Chairman Lin's extremely important inscription. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary masses of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications exposed the heinous crime of the agent of the Chinese Khrushchev in the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications and, on the eve of the 41st anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army, printed commemorative stamps and distributed them nationwide.

　　非常精辟地表达了毛主席的建军思想和建军路线
　　林彪副主席重要题词昨天发表
    林彪副主席于一九六五年为邮电部发行《中国人民解放军》特种邮票作了极为重要的题词。中国赫鲁晓夫在邮电部的代理人，对林彪副主席这一题词恶毒地进行了扣压和封锁。在文化大革命中，邮电部的无产阶级革命派揭露了这一滔天罪行，并印成纪念邮票，在全国发行
    新华社三十一日讯　伟大领袖毛主席的亲密战友林彪副主席于一九六五年七月二十六日，为邮电部发行《中国人民解放军》特种邮票的题词，今天，在人民解放军建军四十一周年的纪念邮票上发表。
    题词全文是：
    “中国人民解放军是毛泽东思想武装起来的队伍，是全心全意为人民服务的队伍，因而是战无不胜的队伍。
      林彪
                               一九六五年七月二十六日”
    林副主席的这一题词，极为重要，非常精辟地表达了毛主席的建军思想和建军路线。
    一九六五年，中国人民解放军建军三十八周年前夕，人民解放军的革命文艺工作者和邮电部的革命群众，在伟大领袖毛主席的“全国学人民解放军”的伟大号召下，设计了一套表现人民解放军活学活用毛主席著作，突出无产阶级政治，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风，发扬三大民主，开展创造四好连队运动的邮票。林副主席为发行这套邮票题了词。中国赫鲁晓夫在邮电部的代理人，对林副主席这一极为重要的题词恶毒地进行了扣压和封锁。在无产阶级文化大革命中，邮电部的无产阶级革命派揭露了中国赫鲁晓夫在邮电部的代理人的这一滔天罪行，并在人民解放军建军四十一周年前夕，印成纪念邮票，在全国发行。（附图片）
