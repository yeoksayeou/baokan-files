Students in several major Brazilian cities held simultaneous demonstrations and flash rallies on August 13 to protest the military dictatorship's suppression of the student movement and the unjust arrest of a student leader.

In the capital of Bahia State, Salvador, anti-government demonstrations erupted on the evening of the 13th. Despite the local military and police being on high alert and occupying key locations in the city, students still held demonstrations in the suburbs. About 2,000 students in the city also set up barricades in the São Caetano workers' district, throwing stones at police cars to resist the military and police suppression. Students from various cities in the interior of Bahia State also joined the demonstration.

Students in the important industrial city of São Paulo held demonstrations in the city's commercial center, protesting the reactionary police's suppression of students and demanding the release of students arrested in the anti-government struggle. The demonstrators also expressed support for workers' demands for wage increases.

Students in the capital of Sergipe State, Aracaju, held multiple flash rallies on the 13th to protest the military dictatorship's suppression of students. University students in the capital of Rio Grande do Norte State, Natal, went on strike to support the city's middle school students' struggle to release arrested student leaders. Students in the capital of Ceará State, Fortaleza, also held demonstrations. Students in the capital of Rio de Janeiro State, Niterói, fought fiercely with mounted police using stones during the demonstration.

The continuous anti-dictatorship and anti-persecution struggles by Brazilian students have made the pro-American military dictatorship in Brazil very anxious. The police in Guanabara State, where Rio de Janeiro is located, fearing that students would hold demonstrations, patrolled the streets of Rio de Janeiro all day on the 13th and occupied key locations in the city.

Over 80,000 Mexican students held another massive demonstration in the capital, Mexico City, on August 13 to protest the police's suppression of students.

The demonstration, which stretched over five kilometers, chanted slogans and held banners demanding the "release of political prisoners" and condemning "murderers," converging at the city's largest square, the Zócalo. In addition to students from various universities in the capital, several hundred teachers and representatives from schools in other regions also participated.

On the same day, students in four Mexican states went on strike to support the capital's student demonstration.

    在巴西巴伊亚州首府萨尔瓦多市，十三日晚爆发了反政府的示威游行。尽管当地军警早已戒备森严，并占领了市内的重要地点，但是，学生们仍然在郊区举行了示威游行。市内的两千名学生还在圣卡埃塔诺工人区筑起街垒，用石块袭击警车，抵抗军警的镇压。巴伊亚州内地各城市的学生也赶来参加了这次示威游行。
    巴西重要工业城市圣保罗的学生也在这个城市的商业中心举行了示威游行，抗议反动警察镇压学生的暴行，要求释放在反政府的斗争中被捕的学生。示威者还表示支持工人要求增加工资的斗争。
