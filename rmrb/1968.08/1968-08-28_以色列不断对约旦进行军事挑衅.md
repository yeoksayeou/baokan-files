Israel, the tool of U.S. imperialism, has been continuously shelling and firing machine guns at the northern border areas of Jordan, repeatedly provoking Jordan militarily.

According to a statement by a Jordanian military spokesman on the evening of the 25th, the Israeli military intermittently shelled ten Jordanian villages on the east bank of the Jordan River from morning to evening on the 25th, damaging a school and several houses. An irrigation project in the Wakaas area was also damaged.

The Jordanian military responded to Israel's military provocations. During the counterattack, the Jordanian military destroyed and damaged two Israeli tanks each, as well as two Israeli vehicle assembly points and one artillery position.

Earlier, the Jordanian military spokesman announced that the Israeli military had fired at Jordanian military positions in the northern Jordan Valley for three consecutive days from the 21st to the 23rd. The Jordanian military retaliated against the provocations of the Israeli aggressors.
