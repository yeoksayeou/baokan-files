Our great leader Chairman Mao’s big-character poster “Fire Upon the Headquarters” has powerfully exposed the evil plot of the handful of top capitalist-roaders within the Party to restore capitalism, and sounded the charge to launch a fierce attack on the bourgeois headquarters headed by China’s Khrushchev. It has greatly crushed the arrogance of the bourgeois reactionaries and greatly bolstered the morale of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. Under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao’s big-character poster “Fire Upon the Headquarters,” the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses throughout the country have held high the banner of “It is reasonable to rebel against the reactionaries,” carried forward the great revolutionary spirit of “Daring to draw the emperor from his horse,” and launched fierce attacks on China’s Khrushchev and his agents in various places, winning decisive victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Today, as we advance toward the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we review Chairman Mao’s big-character poster “Fire Upon the Headquarters” and recall the two-year battle course. I deeply feel that all victories, whether big or small, are victories of Mao Zedong Thought and victories of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the wise leadership of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin will forever guide us from one victory to another.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: “The rights the people have won must not be allowed to be wantonly infringed upon, but must be defended with arms.” On the occasion of the second anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao’s big-character poster “Fire Upon the Headquarters,” we resolve to carry forward the spirit of thorough revolution of “Pursuing the fleeing enemy with remaining courage,” and together with the broad revolutionary masses, launch a deep and protracted revolutionary criticism and criticism, conscientiously do a good job of cleaning up the class ranks, thoroughly sweep away all the poison spread by China’s Khrushchev and his agents in Northeast, Liaoning, and Shenyang, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Let us closely unite around the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and forge ahead along the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao!

    我们伟大领袖毛主席《炮打司令部》的大字报，有力地戳穿了党内一小撮最大的走资派妄图复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋，吹响了向以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部猛烈开火的进军号。它大灭了资产阶级反动派的威风，大长了无产阶级革命派的志气。在毛主席《炮打司令部》大字报的光辉照耀下，全国无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，高举“对反动派造反有理”的大旗，发扬“舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马”的大无畏革命精神，向中国赫鲁晓夫及其在各地的代理人发动猛烈进攻，夺得了无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利。
    今天，在向无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大进军中，重温毛主席《炮打司令部》的大字报，回顾两年来的战斗历程，我深深地体会到：千胜利，万胜利，一切胜利都是毛泽东思想的胜利，都是以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部英明领导的胜利。战无不胜的毛泽东思想，以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的英明领导，将永远指引我们从胜利走向胜利。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“人民得到的权利，绝不允许轻易丧失，必须用战斗来保卫。”在纪念毛主席《炮打司令部》大字报发表两周年的时候，我们决心发扬“宜将剩勇追穷寇”的彻底革命精神，同广大革命群众一起，深入持久地开展革命大批判，认真做好清理阶级队伍的工作，彻底扫除中国赫鲁晓夫及其在东北、辽宁、沈阳的代理人所散布的一切流毒，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    让我们紧紧地团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的周围，沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线奋勇前进！
