Everything Follow Chairman Mao, Everything Obey Chairman Mao

By Chen Konghua, a platoon leader from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, and Tian Yanzhong, a soldier

In the Party, the Chinese Khrushchev has been promoting anarchism and has put forth some notorious reactionary fallacies. He says things like, "No one is worthy of our obedience," and "We obey the Party, we obey the Central Committee, we obey the truth, but not individuals." These words, in essence, are calling for obedience to him and for following the directives of the bourgeois headquarters he leads. Hasn't he already proclaimed himself as "×-Khrushchev" and even shouted, "China still needs to be led by people like us"? He deliberately opposes obedience to the Party, the Central Committee, the truth, and the revolutionary leaders, aiming to undermine the position of the great leader Chairman Mao as the supreme commander of the entire Party, the entire military, and the entire nation. This is a highly malicious plot.

The great leader Chairman Mao is the core of unity and cohesion for the entire Party, the entire military, and the entire nation. Lenin once pointed out: "In history, any class, if it does not produce its own political leaders and advanced representatives who are skilled in organizing and leading movements, cannot achieve a ruling position." Chairman Mao is the most outstanding leader of the proletariat in contemporary times, the representative of the Party and the masses. As Comrade Lin Biao pointed out: "Comrade Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time." "Mao Zedong Thought is the banner of our times," "it is the guiding principle for all work of the entire Party, the entire military, and the entire nation." For all Party members and revolutionaries, obeying the Party and the Central Committee means obeying Chairman Mao, obeying Mao Zedong Thought, and obeying the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin.

We revolutionary soldiers have only one principle in our hearts: "Everything follow Chairman Mao," "everything obey Chairman Mao." We deeply understand that obeying Chairman Mao, obeying the battle commands of Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters, is the highest requirement of proletarian revolutionary discipline, the highest proletarian consciousness, the purest proletarian party spirit, and the greatest loyalty to Chairman Mao.

Everything follow Chairman Mao, everything obey Chairman Mao, is the greatest wish and motivation for us revolutionary soldiers. Our unit, today builds roads in high mountains and tomorrow builds bridges in deep valleys. Wherever Chairman Mao points, we fight there. During construction, the tasks are often complex, the work sites are scattered, and movements are frequent. However, no matter how special the conditions are, how scattered the personnel are, or how complex the processes are, we consciously use Mao Zedong Thought to unify our understanding, steps, and actions. We strive to think as one, work as one. Take our unit's coal loading team, for example. They are composed of about ten people from six or seven companies, working year-round outside to load coal, supplying our unit's living coal and heating coal. This job is dirty and tiring, and they are far from leadership, facing many difficulties. But when comrades realize that burning coal is in response to Chairman Mao's great call to "be thrifty and make revolution," they all resolutely load more coal, load good coal, and contribute all their strength to implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, becoming infinitely loyal soldiers to Chairman Mao.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, whenever Chairman Mao's latest instructions are issued, they immediately study them, ensuring that no matter how far they are from Chairman Mao, they follow him closely; they actively respond to Chairman Mao's great call to support the government and love the people, helping workers set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and proactively helping coal miners solve difficulties, earning praise from local coal miners. They actively respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness," linking their work with implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, with the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. In their work, they are proactive and hardworking, enduring hardships and labor. In winter, their hands are so frozen that they can't hold the shovel handle, but not a single person complains; in summer, their bodies are drenched in sweat like ink, but not a single person minds the dirt. Over the past three years, with a heart infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, they have used their greatest strength to implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, completing their tasks perfectly, saving the unit over 1,200 tons of coal each year. If we were to follow what the Chinese Khrushchev says and fall into the anarchist quagmire, we would not be able to achieve unity and concentration based on Mao Zedong Thought, and we would not be able to complete all the tasks given to us by the Party and Chairman Mao.

Countless facts prove that obeying Chairman Mao, obeying Mao Zedong Thought, and obeying Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters is victory. The closer we follow Chairman Mao and the more we act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, the stronger our combat effectiveness and the greater and better our achievements.

"Whatever the enemy opposes, we support." We must increase our class consciousness and two-line struggle consciousness a thousandfold, consciously observe proletarian revolutionary discipline, closely unite around the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, unify our understanding, steps, and actions, thoroughly criticize the reactionary "multi-center theory," timely expose the tricks of a handful of class enemies attempting to sabotage Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters, and bury the anarchism advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev!

### 一切紧跟毛主席，一切服从毛主席

    一切紧跟毛主席，一切服从毛主席
    解放军某部指导员　陈孔华　战士　田艳忠
    中国赫鲁晓夫在党内大搞无政府主义，提出了一些臭名昭著的反动谬论，胡说什么“任何那一个人都不值得我们服从”，“我们是服从党，服从中央，服从真理，而非服从个人。”这些黑话，说穿了，就是要人们服从他，跟着他为首的资产阶级司令部的指挥棒转，他不是早就自封为“×克思”，甚至叫嚷“中国还是要由我们这些人来领导”吗？他别有用心地把服从党，服从中央，服从真理和服从革命领袖对立起来，就是妄图动摇伟大领袖毛主席在全党、全军、全国的最高统帅地位。这是一个极其恶毒的阴谋。
    伟大领袖毛主席是我们全党、全军、全国团结、统一的核心。列宁曾经指出：“历史上，任何一个阶级，如果不推举出自己善于组织运动和领导运动的政治领袖和先进代表，就不可能取得统治地位。”毛主席是当代无产阶级最杰出的领袖，是党和群众的代表。正如林副主席所指出的：“毛泽东同志是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。”“毛泽东思想是我们时代的旗帜”，“是全党、全军和全国一切工作的指导方针。”对我们全体党员和革命者来说，服从党，服从中央，就是服从毛主席，服从毛泽东思想，服从以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部。
    我们革命战士心里只有一本账：“一切紧跟毛主席”，“一切服从毛主席”。我们深深懂得：服从毛主席、服从毛主席的无产阶级司令部的一切战斗号令，就是执行无产阶级革命纪律的最高要求，就是最高的无产阶级觉悟，最纯的无产阶级党性，就是对毛主席最大的忠诚。
    一切紧跟毛主席，一切服从毛主席，是我们革命战士最大的心愿和动力。我们部队，今天在高山峻岭修路，明天在大河深谷架桥，毛主席指到那里我们就战斗在那里。在施工当中往往是工种复杂，工点分散，调动频繁。但是，不管条件怎样特殊，人员怎样分散，工序怎样复杂，我们都自觉地用毛泽东思想来统一认识，统一步伐，统一行动。做到心往一处想，劲往一处使。就拿我们部队的装煤石班来说吧，他们十来个人是从六七个连队抽来组成的，常年在外装煤石，供应我们部队的生活用煤和烤火用煤。这活又脏又累，同时，远离领导，困难很大。但当同志们认识到烧煤石是响应毛主席“要节约闹革命”的伟大号召，都坚决为革命多装煤石，装好煤石，为贯彻毛主席的革命路线贡献自己的一切力量，做无限忠于毛主席的好战士。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，每当毛主席最新指示传下来，他们立即学习，做到隔毛主席千山万水，跟毛主席寸步不离；他们积极响应毛主席拥政爱民的伟大号召，帮助工人举办毛泽东思想学习班，落实毛主席最新指示，主动帮助煤矿工人解决困难，受到当地煤矿工人的赞扬。他们积极响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”的伟大号召，把自己的工作同贯彻执行毛主席革命路线，同中国革命和世界革命联系起来。在工作中积极肯干，吃大苦耐大劳。冬天，手冻得握不住铁锹把，他们没有一个人叫苦；夏天，身上的滴滴汗水如墨汁，他们没有一个人怕脏。近三年来，他们人人怀着对毛主席一颗无限忠诚的红心，把自己最大的力量用来贯彻执行毛主席的革命路线，圆满地完成了任务，每年为部队节约原煤一千二百多吨。如果按中国赫鲁晓夫说的去做，陷入无政府主义的泥坑里去，就根本谈不上在毛泽东思想基础上的集中统一，就不能完成党和毛主席交给我们的一切任务。
    无数事实证明：服从毛主席、服从毛泽东思想、服从毛主席无产阶级司令部就是胜利。我们跟毛主席越紧，越是按毛主席指示办事，战斗力就越强，取得的成绩就越多、越大、越好。
      “凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护”。我们一定要千百倍地提高阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟，自觉地遵守无产阶级革命纪律，紧紧团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的周围，统一认识、统一步伐、统一行动，彻底批判反动的“多中心论”，及时识破一小撮阶级敌人妄图破坏毛主席的无产阶级司令部的一切阴谋诡计，把中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的无政府主义彻底埋葬！
