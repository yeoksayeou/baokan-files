Title: Standing on One Point, Facing the Whole County

I am a cadre of a production brigade. The poor and lower-middle peasants elected me to serve as a standing committee member of the county revolutionary committee. I am both happy and worried. I am happy because a person like me, who was trampled upon in the old society, can now participate in managing the affairs of the whole county. This is the greatest support and care that our great leader Chairman Mao has given to us poor and lower-middle peasants! I am worried because I am just a cadre of a production brigade. I do not understand the situation of the whole county, and I do not leave production. How can I face the whole county and complete the tasks given to me by the Party and the masses?

I thought about this over and over again but could not figure it out. Just when I was in a dilemma, a full-time committee member of the county revolutionary committee came to my brigade and discussed with me the issue of promoting the "Learning from Dazhai in Agriculture" movement throughout the county. Our brigade had encountered great obstacles in learning from Dazhai. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants were very enthusiastic about learning from Dazhai, but some people with serious capitalist thoughts spread the idea that learning from Dazhai was "hard and tiring." Especially, two bad elements who had infiltrated the brigade leadership cadre even obstructed the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team sent by the county from entering the village and refused to accept the honorable task given by the county revolutionary committee to turn our brigade into a Dazhai-style model. We were furious. Based on the performance of these two bad elements, we said that unless we eliminate these two obstacles, we cannot proceed on the path of learning from Dazhai. Thus, the poor and lower-middle peasants rose up and exposed these two elements who sabotaged the learning from Dazhai movement, and severely criticized them. We also selected steadfast socialist activists to strengthen the brigade leadership cadre. After that, the learning from Dazhai movement in the whole brigade quickly developed. I reported these situations to this full-time committee member, and he enthusiastically praised us for grasping the key point. He said that in learning from Dazhai, the first thing to do is to build a strong Dazhai-style leadership cadre, and this experience has universal guiding significance for the whole county. His words surprised me. I thought, our production brigade is just a small individual unit in the whole county, how can it have guiding significance for the whole county?!

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "In all our work, we must proceed from the interests of the people and not from our personal interests. We must always put the interests of the people in the first place." Chairman Mao's teaching made me see clearly. I thought, the reason why this full-time committee member could discover something with universal significance from our single point is precisely because he followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "combining the general with the individual" to do things.

From then on, I linked our brigade with the two thousand brigades in the whole county to think about problems, and indeed discovered some problems with universal significance from a single point. For example, during a certain period, many communes and brigades around us came to our brigade for a visit. Most of them were inspired by our firm grasp of class struggle; however, a few of them were not concerned with these issues but rather with high-yield fields and technical measures. I thought, this is a matter of direction. We must guide everyone's interest to focus on the proletarian political line and class struggle, and we must not lead them down the wrong path of production and technical leadership. Thus, I proposed that all Dazhai-style model units in the whole county should pay attention to this problem when receiving visitors. The result of doing this was very good.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must not decide questions without sufficient investigation, without full knowledge of the facts." In order to help the county revolutionary committee have a more sufficient and accurate basis when deciding on issues and guiding the work of the whole county, I also established several "contact points" of different types in the production brigades and communes around me. I discovered some problems at the "contact points," compared, analyzed, and synthesized them to see which were individual problems and which were common problems. During a certain period, after achieving some successes in learning from Dazhai, a phenomenon of stagnation appeared. With this problem in mind, I used the gaps in labor time to conduct investigations at several "contact points." In brigades with better conditions, I found that they had the emotion of relaxing and being complacent; in brigades with worse conditions, I found that they had the thought of relying on external aid. Although the manifestations were different, a common cause of stagnation was: in the process of learning from Dazhai, the continuous struggle against wrong thoughts was not done well enough. I raised this problem, and the commune and county both attached great importance to it. At the "contact points," I deeply felt that this was a good way for non-full-time committee members to understand the situation on the ground. Therefore, I expanded the establishment of "contact points" to more "contact persons," understanding the situation from the masses in all directions, and they became my good assistants in understanding the overall situation.

### 立足一点，面向全县

    立足一点，面向全县
    江西分宜县革命委员会常委、生产队长　李春牙
    我是一个生产队的干部，贫下中农选我到县革命委员会担任常委，我又高兴又担心。高兴的是，我这样一个在旧社会被踩在脚下的受苦人，今天居然能参加掌管全县大事，这是伟大领袖毛主席对我们贫下中农最大的支持，最大的关怀！担心的是，我这样一个生产队的干部，既不了解全县情况，又不脱离生产，怎样面向全县完成党和群众交给的任务？
    我翻来复去没想通。正当为难的时候，县革委会一位脱产委员来到我队，找我研究在全县开展农业学大寨的问题。我们队学大寨就曾遇到很大阻力。广大贫下中农学大寨的积极性很高，可是一些资本主义思想严重的人却散布什么学大寨“又苦又累”。尤其是钻进大队领导班子里的两个坏家伙，甚至阻挠县里派来的毛泽东思想宣传队进村，不接受县革委会把我们大队办成大寨样板的光荣任务。我们气极了。根据这两个坏家伙的表现，都说，不打掉这两条拦路蛇，大寨之路我们走不通。于是，贫下中农纷纷起来，揪出了这两个破坏学大寨的坏家伙，狠狠进行了批判，并且选出了坚定的社会主义积极分子，充实了大队领导班子。这以后，全大队学大寨的活动就迅速开展起来了。我把这些情况向这位脱产委员一汇报，他满腔热情地称赞我们抓到了关键。他说，学大寨，首先抓好建设一个大寨式的坚强领导班子，这个经验对全县有普遍的指导意义。他这一席话，使我很惊讶。我想，我们生产队在全县只是一个小小的个别单位，怎能对全县会有指导作用？！
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“我们共产党人无论进行何项工作，有两个方法是必须采用的，一是一般和个别相结合，二是领导和群众相结合。”毛主席这一教导，使我豁然开朗。我想，这位脱产委员所以能从我们一个点上发现对全县有指导意义的东西，正是他遵循毛主席关于“一般和个别相结合”的教导去做的结果。
    从此，我把我们队经常和全县两千个队联系起来思考问题，果然从一个点上也发现了一些有普遍意义的问题。比如，有个时期，周围许多社、队到我们队来参观。他们中多数人对我们狠抓阶级斗争，很受启发；但是，也有少数人关心的不是这些，而是高产田垄，技术措施。我想，这是一个方向问题，一定要把大家的兴趣引导到关心突出无产阶级政治、关心阶级斗争上去，决不能引入突出生产、技术挂帅的歧途。于是，我提请全县各地大寨式样板单位在接待参观人员时要注意这个问题。这样做的结果，反映都很好。
    毛主席教导我们：“不可无根据地、主观地决定问题。”为了帮助县革委会在决定问题、指导全县工作时有较充分和较准确的根据，我还在自己周围的生产队和大队中建立了几个不同类型的“联系点”。在“联系点”上发现一些问题，加以比较、分析和综合，看看那些是个别问题，那些是共同性的问题。有个时期，当学大寨取得一些成就后，产生了停滞不前的现象。带着这个问题，利用劳动空隙时间，我就到几个“联系点”上调查。在条件较好的队，发现他们有松劲自满的情绪；在条件较差的队，发现有依赖外援的思想。尽管表现不同，但停滞不前的一个共同原因是：在学大寨的过程中，不断抓活思想做得不够。我把这个问题提出来，公社、县里都很重视。在“联系点”上，我深深体会到，这是不脱产委员了解面上情况的一个好办法。因此，我把建立“联系点”又扩大到多交“联系人”，从四面八方的群众中了解情况，成了我了解全面情况的好助手。
