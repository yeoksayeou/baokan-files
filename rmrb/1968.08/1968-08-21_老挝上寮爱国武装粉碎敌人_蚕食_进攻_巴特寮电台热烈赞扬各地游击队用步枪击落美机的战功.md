Patriotic forces in Upper Laos have thwarted the enemy's "gnawing" attacks, and the Pathet Lao radio station has enthusiastically praised the local guerrilla units for their achievements in shooting down American planes with rifles.

New China News Agency, Khamkeut, August 19th – According to a report from the Pathet Lao News Agency, the right-wing military forces in Laos, in an attempt to salvage their disastrous losses during the dry season, launched new "gnawing" attacks and air raids on the liberated areas in Upper Laos at the beginning of the rainy season. However, they have been met with heavy resistance from the patriotic armed forces.

In the past month since July, the patriotic armed forces in Sam Neua Province have annihilated 180 enemy soldiers in the Mang Song, Phou Xin Sa, and Phou Nam Ba areas, and shot down two American planes.

The guerrilla units in Xieng Ngoun Province's Xieng Khaung District annihilated nearly 60 enemy soldiers in the last two weeks of July.

From early July to August 10th, the patriotic armed forces in Phongsaly Province killed and wounded 50 enemy soldiers in the pursuit battles, seizing 91 various types of weapons.

New China News Agency, Khamkeut, August 17th – The Pathet Lao radio station broadcasted an article on August 17th, enthusiastically praising the local guerrilla units and people for their achievements in shooting down American aggressor planes with rifles.

The article stated that in the past two to three years, in addition to deploying a large number of troops to launch "gnawing" attacks on the liberated areas, the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys have also sent various types of aircraft, including B-52 bombers, to indiscriminately bomb the liberated areas. Facing the so-called "air superiority" boasted by the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys, the Lao patriotic military and people have engaged in a life-and-death struggle with the enemy, bravely counterattacking the invading enemy planes. So far, the Lao patriotic military and people have shot down and destroyed more than 820 enemy planes.

The article stated that among the shot-down enemy planes, many were shot down by local guerrilla units and people. In July alone, the guerrilla units and people in Sam Neua Province used rifles to shoot down three American planes. The guerrilla units and people in other provinces have also shot down many enemy planes.

The article stated that the above victories clearly show that not only the anti-aircraft units can shoot down enemy planes, but the guerrilla units and people can also shoot down enemy planes with rifles. The so-called "air superiority" boasted by the U.S. imperialists has been shattered by the Lao patriotic military and people.

Local armed forces in the liberated areas of Laos are fully equipped and ready to take the initiative to attack and annihilate the enemy.

    巴特寮电台热烈赞扬各地游击队用步枪击落美机的战功
    新华社康开十九日电据巴特寮通讯社报道：老挝右派军队为了挽救旱季遭到的惨重失败，从雨季开始，对上寮解放区发动了新的“蚕食”进攻和空袭，但遭到了爱国武装力量的沉重打击。
    桑怒省爱国武装力量在从七月开始的一个多月里，在芒松、富欣沙和富南巴地区歼灭敌军一百八十名，击落美机两架。
    琅勃拉邦省川银县游击队，在七月份的后两周内，歼敌近六十名。
    丰沙里省爱国武装力量从七月初到八月十日期间，在追歼匪徒的战斗中，打死打伤匪徒五十名，缴获各种武器九十一件。
    新华社康开十七日电巴特寮电台十七日广播一篇文章，热烈赞扬各地游击队和人民用步枪击落美国强盗飞机的战功。
    文章说，最近两、三年以来，美帝国主义及其走狗除了调动大批的兵力向解放区发动“蚕食”进攻外，还派遣包括Ｂ—52型轰炸机在内的各种类型飞机狂轰滥炸解放区。面对美帝国主义及其走狗所吹嘘的“空中优势”，老挝爱国军民同敌人进行了你死我活的斗争，英勇地反击来犯的敌机。到目前为止，老挝爱国军民已击落击毁敌机八百二十多架。
    文章说，在被击落的敌机中，有许多是各地游击队和人民击落的。仅桑怒省游击队和人民七月份就用步枪击落美机三架。其它各省游击队和人民也击落许多敌机。
    文章说，上述胜利清楚地表明：不仅防空部队可以击落敌机，游击队和人民用步枪也可以击落敌机。美帝国主义所吹嘘的“空中优势”已被老挝爱国军民所粉碎。
