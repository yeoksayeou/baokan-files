	Follow Chairman Mao and Revolution for Life
	National Agricultural Labor Model and Deputy Chairman of the Sichuan Revolutionary Committee, Zhang Sizhou

	Our great teacher Chairman Mao personally presided over the formulation of the "Sixteen Points," which pronounced the death sentence on the reactionary bourgeois line represented by China's Khrushchev. It is our great battle program to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. Two years ago, when the "Sixteen Points" were issued, I was visiting our great leader Chairman Mao's hometown. After returning to Jianyang, I immediately joined the great army of the proletarian cultural revolution and, together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and launched a fierce attack on China's Khrushchev and his agents in Sichuan Province and Jianyang County.

	However, under the plotting of the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev, in February 1967, a counter-revolutionary capitalist restoration tide from top to bottom emerged in Sichuan. A small clique of capitalist roaders within the former Jianyang County Committee used the dictatorial tools they could still control to label a large number of proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses as "counter-revolutionaries." They arrested me and, over a period of more than seventy days, struggled against me thirty-seven times, attempting to put me to death. I thought, we are defending Mao Zedong Thought, we are defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, what crime have we committed! What are we afraid of! I firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: "Resolve to struggle, be prepared for sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." At the most difficult time in the struggle, the "Sixteen Points" gave me boundless strength: "Because the resistance is relatively great, the struggle will have twists and turns, and may even have multiple twists and turns. These twists and turns are not harmful. They will temper the proletariat and other laboring masses, especially the younger generation, gain experience and lessons, and understand that the road of revolution is tortuous and not smooth." In this way, I and my comrades in the proletarian revolutionary ranks persisted in the struggle and underwent the most severe tests.

	The proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin pay the most attention to the masses, believe in the masses the most, and cherish the masses the most, and have given the greatest care and support to our revolutionary actions. In April, I received a notice to go to Beijing for a meeting. In Beijing, the central leaders received us, which was a great concern and support for us Sichuan proletarian revolutionaries, making me unable to hold back my tears of joy and excitement, and I couldn't sleep for several nights.

	In the past two years, under the brilliant guidance of the "Sixteen Points" and Chairman Mao's series of important instructions, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Sichuan Province and Jianyang County has achieved one great victory after another. Currently, under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, we are uniting, consolidating our will, unifying our steps, and unifying our actions, with one heart and one mind, to struggle for the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

　　紧跟毛主席干一辈子革命
　　全国农业劳动模范、四川省革命委员会副主任  张泗洲
    我们伟大导师毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”，宣判了以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的资产阶级反动路线的死刑，是我们将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的伟大战斗纲领。两年前，当“十六条”发表的时候，我正在我们伟大领袖毛主席的家乡访问，回到简阳以后，立即投入了无产阶级文化革命大军的伟大行列，和贫下中农群众一起，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大造中国赫鲁晓夫及其在四川省和简阳县的代理人的反。
    可是，在以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部的阴谋策划下，一九六七年二月，四川出现了一股由上而下的资本主义反革命复辟逆流，旧简阳县委内一小撮走资派动用了他们当时还能控制的专政工具，把大批无产阶级革命派和革命群众打成“反革命”。他们把我抓起来，在七十多天当中，斗争我三十七次，企图把我置于死地。我想，我们捍卫毛泽东思想，我们捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，我们有什么罪！我们怕什么！我牢记毛主席的教导：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”在斗争最艰苦的时候，“十六条”给了我无穷无尽的力量：“由于阻力比较大，斗争会有反复，甚至可能有多次的反复。这种反复，没有什么害处。它将使无产阶级和其他劳动群众，特别是年青一代，得到锻炼，取得经验教训，懂得革命的道路是曲折的，不平坦的。”就这样，我和无产阶级革命派的战友们坚持斗争，经受了最严峻的考验。
    以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部最关心群众，最相信群众，最爱护群众，对于我们的革命行动给予了最大的关怀与支持。四月间，我得到通知，要我到北京开会。在北京，中央首长接见了我们，这是对我们四川无产阶级革命派的极大关怀，极大支持，使我不禁热泪盈眶，兴奋得几个晚上都睡不着觉。
    两年来，在“十六条”和毛主席一系列重要指示的光辉照耀下，四川省和简阳县的无产阶级文化大革命取得了一个又一个的伟大胜利。目前，我们正在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的领导下团结起来，统一意志，统一步伐，统一行动，万众一心，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利而斗争。
