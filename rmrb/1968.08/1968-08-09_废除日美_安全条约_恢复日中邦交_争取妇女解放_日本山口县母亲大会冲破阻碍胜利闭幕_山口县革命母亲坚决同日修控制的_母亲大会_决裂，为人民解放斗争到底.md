The 14th Yamaguchi Prefecture Mothers' Conference, holding high the banners of opposing the U.S.-Japan "security" system, demanding the withdrawal of U.S. military bases, restoring Sino-Japanese relations, and struggling for women's liberation, was held in Yamaguchi City for two days and concluded successfully on July 29.

This year's conference was the second held after the mothers of Yamaguchi Prefecture, who have been fighting for the liberation of the Japanese people and women, broke away from the so-called "Mothers' Conference" controlled by the revisionists. They overcame various obstacles and sabotage by the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries to hold this conference.

Revolutionary women and mothers' representatives from Yokohama, Nagoya, Hyogo, Takarazuka, Osaka, Fukuoka, Kyoto, and other places were invited to attend the conference.

The Yamaguchi Prefecture Committee of the Japanese Communist Party (Left Wing), the Yamaguchi Prefecture Headquarters of the Japanese Socialist Party, and the Yamaguchi Prefecture Federation of Labor Unions all sent representatives to attend the conference and delivered speeches.

The conference's declaration stated that the current world situation is excellent and is developing in a direction highly favorable to the revolutionary and progressive cause. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has achieved great victories, and China has become a stronghold of the world's people's liberation. The people's struggles in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are flourishing. People's struggles have also erupted in Western Europe and North America. Revolutionary women in various countries are playing a significant role in these struggles.

The declaration condemned U.S. imperialism and the Sato reactionary government for intensifying the revival of Japanese militarism and condemned the crimes of the revisionist group led by Miyamoto and its controlled "New Women's Association" for serving the reactionary forces of the U.S. and Japan and attempting to prevent women from participating in politics.

The declaration said that in Japan, where U.S. imperialism has launched an aggressive war, mothers must take action for Japan's independence and peace, that is, to abolish the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," demand the withdrawal of U.S. military bases, oppose the reactionary forces of the U.S. and Japan from intensifying the revival of Japanese militarism, and demand the restoration of Sino-Japanese relations.

The declaration called on Japanese working women to strengthen their unity with women of other classes, strengthen their unity with Japanese workers, peasants, and all laboring people, and strengthen their unity with progressive and revolutionary women in China, Vietnam, and the rest of the world. It urged them to raise the banner of women's liberation and fight to the end.
