	South African students at the most important university in the country, the University of the Witwatersrand, defied the repeated threats and warnings from the South African racist authorities and held another protest rally on campus on the 26th, continuing their struggle against the apartheid policies of the South African reactionary government.

	Since students at the University of Cape Town began protesting against the South African government's ban on the appointment of African scholar Mafuye as a lecturer on August 14, students at the University of the Witwatersrand have actively participated in the struggle against racial discrimination.

	Over the past few days, students at this university have continuously held protest demonstrations and rallies.

	Faced with the students' struggle, the South African authorities have repeatedly issued threats and warnings.

	South African "Prime Minister" Vorster shouted on the 24th: if the students do not restore "order," he will send in the police for suppression.

	Students at the University of the Witwatersrand completely ignored Vorster's warning and continued their struggle.

	A student leader at this university publicly announced on the 26th: "No matter what Vorster says, this movement (referring to the struggle against racial discrimination) is advancing."

	Newswire from Melbourne: Australian workers have recently held strikes and demonstrations to protest against the brutal exploitation of monopoly capital and demand wage increases.

	Thousands of metalworkers in Queensland went on strike across the state on the 21st, demanding wage increases.

	Four thousand dockworkers in Melbourne stopped work and held a meeting, expressing their determination to fight for higher wages; after the meeting, more than a thousand dockworkers took to the streets for a demonstration march.
