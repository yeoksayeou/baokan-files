China's Khrushchev, the biggest capitalist roader within the Party, is the biggest obstacle to the reform of Peking opera. Since the eve of national liberation, every time a critical moment in class struggle arrives, he jumps out to stubbornly oppose Chairman Mao's revolutionary line on literature and art, oppose the reform of Peking opera, and turn the Peking opera stage into an important stronghold for his capitalist restoration.

I

After the basic victory of the New Democratic Revolution, where is China heading? Is it towards socialism or capitalism? This was the primary question facing the Chinese people. The great leader Chairman Mao called for "building China into a great socialist country" at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee. At this historical turning point, China's Khrushchev rushed out, vigorously advocating for the capitalist road and opposing the socialist revolution. In the field of drama, he openly opposed Chairman Mao's policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" for drama reform, opposed the transformation of old dramas, and opposed the banning of bad plays. From the very beginning, he attempted to steer the development of drama onto the capitalist track.

At that time, in the newly liberated cities, reactionary dramas of imperialism and feudalism dominated the stage. According to the demands of the revolutionary masses nationwide, many cities and regions took revolutionary measures to ban bad plays. China's Khrushchev was extremely dissatisfied with this and openly opposed the banning of bad plays. In April 1949, he shouted in Tianjin: "Tianjin banned some old dramas, making people eat less, not eat at all, and people are not satisfied, there are problems that we need to solve, this is a stupid thing," "propagating feudalism, no fear, it has been thousands of years, we have won." Before Shanghai was liberated, he told the counter-revolutionary revisionist Summer Yan: "What are you afraid of? Shanghai has performed so many bad plays in the past, the Communist Party has also gained the world." From these shouts, it is clear how much he cherishes and cares for those bad plays, and how angry and resentful he is towards the revolutionary measures to ban bad plays!

Performing bad plays, the Communist Party has also gained the world. This is the extremely reactionary black talk that China's Khrushchev uses to defend bad plays. The great leader Chairman Mao pointed out at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee: "We must learn to fight political, economic, and cultural struggles against imperialists, the Kuomintang, and the bourgeoisie in the cities;" "If we do not pay attention to these issues, do not learn to fight these battles, and achieve victory in these battles, we will not be able to maintain power, we will not be able to stand firm, we will fail." Banning bad plays and striking at reactionary culture is a serious cultural struggle we are waging in the cities against imperialism, the Kuomintang, and the bourgeoisie. This struggle is a major issue concerning whether we can consolidate our power and whether we can gain or lose the world. China's Khrushchev's nonsense about "performing bad plays, the Communist Party has also gained the world" is to make us give up this serious struggle and keep the thoroughly reactionary feudal and capitalist culture intact as a propaganda tool for the reactionary ruling class to counterattack the people and as a public opinion stronghold for his conspiracy to restore capitalism.

China's Khrushchev opposed the banning of bad plays and used the slogan of "everyone has food to eat." What nonsense like "banning some old dramas, making people eat less, not eat at all," "everyone has food to eat, it's good," and so on. This fallacy is the most shameless slander against the Party's cultural policy. We banned bad plays, not the performance of plays. After liberation, all the old actors and troupes that used to serve the landlords and bourgeoisie faced the problem of self-transformation. They eat the people's food, so they must serve proletarian politics and serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. If they perform revolutionary plays, we not only do not ban them, but also actively encourage and strongly support them, giving them the fullest freedom to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. If we follow China's Khrushchev's way, allowing bad plays to spread freely, it would be letting them eat the people's food and do things that harm the people, eat socialist food and serve the restoration of capitalism. Let the overthrown reactionary class come back, not only will the broad masses of laboring people fall back into the abyss of oppression and exploitation, but these actors and troupes will also rely on the bourgeoisie's money bag to live again, truly having no food to eat. China's Khrushchev wants workers to beg capitalists to "exploit me a little, then I have food to eat." He wants dancing girls to continue to show off their charms, saying that this way "the dancing girls have food to eat, and rich people have a place to spend money." This is extremely shameless and thoroughly reactionary! Under the pretense of "everyone has food to eat," China's Khrushchev wants to protect all reactionary dramas and cultures that numb the people. He dreams of restoring the paradise of exploiters and the hell of laboring people.

II

In 1956, the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production in our country was basically completed. The bourgeoisie lost their economic base for survival, but they were still using the ideological and cultural positions they controlled to make a desperate resistance. The class struggle within the country was quite intense. Internationally, the Khrushchev revisionist clique appeared, and imperialism took the opportunity to launch an anti-communist wave, causing waves of evil and misty fog. At this critical moment, China's Khrushchev jumped out again, even more fiercely opposing the reform of Peking opera, opening the door for ghosts and demons to come out, and actively advocating for the restoration of capitalism.

As soon as the 20th Congress of the Soviet revisionists ended, China's Khrushchev closely coordinated with them and systematically put forward a counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic line. He arrogantly distorted the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" into "allowing coexistence" and "each doing their own thing," emphasizing that "innovation cannot be forced," and striving to defend the continued occupation of the Peking opera stage by feudal and capitalist reactionary dramas. He even blatantly lifted the ban on bad plays that had been banned since liberation. Suddenly, traitor plays, erotic plays, and ghost plays like "The Four Generals Visit Their Mother," "The Dragon Plays with the Phoenix," and "The Investiture of the Gods" all reappeared on the stage.

After the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production, whether Peking opera should be reformed is a major issue concerning whether the socialist revolution should be carried out to the end or be half-hearted, and whether the socialist state will change color. Chairman Mao taught us: "A certain culture (as an ideological form of culture) is a reflection of the politics and economy of a certain society and also has a great influence and effect on the politics and economy of a certain society." After the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production, China's Khrushchev still said: "The reform of drama does not need to be a big reform," "innovation should not be forced," making every effort to protect old Peking opera from dying and using rotten old culture to destroy the socialist economic base and shake the proletarian dictatorship.

"Some old plays have educational significance." This is a shield that China's Khrushchev used to oppose the reform of Peking opera. The so-called "educational significance" has specific class content. What does he advocate and praise the most? "The Four Generals Visit Their Mother" is the advocacy of traitor philosophy and survival philosophy; "The Tiger Village" is the beautification of feudal landlord running dogs and traitor Huang Tianbao. Originally, he said "educational significance" is traitor education, collaborator education, slave education, education of landlords and the bourgeoisie.

Why did China's Khrushchev vigorously promote "The Four Generals Visit Their Mother" and "The Tiger Village" in 1956? In connection with his own reactionary history and the political background at that time, it is not difficult to understand. He wanted to beautify the image of traitors on the stage of drama for the traitors on the political stage, cheer for the traitor of the international communist movement, Khrushchev, and exonerate himself and the traitor clique under his wing. The traitor Yang Silan in "The Four Generals Visit Their Mother" sang the voice of traitors. China's Khrushchev promoted the idea of "writing a confession in the white terror," Soviet Khrushchev advocated "what use is principle when your head is cut off," and Yang Silan declared: "Since I have been captured, death is of no benefit to the country, it is better to agree and stay in another country," how similar they are! China's Khrushchev is using Yang Silan to peddle "traitor philosophy" and "survival philosophy" to betray and sell out the proletarian revolutionary cause on a large scale.

"Peking opera has a high artistic level and cannot be ignored or changed at will." This is another shield that China's Khrushchev used to oppose the reform of Peking opera. He openly called for: "Plays like 'The Plum Blossom Village,' 'The Second Visit to the Palace,' and 'The Four Generals Visit Their Mother' should also 'preserve the technique and inherit the artistic achievements.'" Here, he only talks about artistic level and does not talk about political ideology, completely ignoring the class nature of art. Chairman Mao taught us: "Some things that are politically reactionary to the core may also have some artistic value. The more reactionary the content of a work and the more artistic it is, the more it can poison the people, and the more it should be rejected." The so-called "high artistic level" and "strong technicality" of old Peking opera that China's Khrushchev praises are either reactionary in content or extremely vulgar bad plays. Like "The Four Generals Visit Their Mother," it was personally directed and carefully crafted by the Qing dynasty rulers, including Empress Dowager Cixi, for the political need of surrendering and recruiting traitors. Japanese imperialism also highly praised its "artistic level." Such "art," the higher the level, the greater the harm to the people, and the more we should reject it.

"All harmless things can be allowed to be performed." This is another shield that China's Khrushchev used to oppose the reform of Peking opera. He said confidently: "The audience's tastes are different," "watching a play can get rest and make people happy," "this encourages socialist enthusiasm." Chairman Mao pointed out early on: "In the present world, all culture or literature and art belong to a certain class and a certain political line." There has never been a super-class art in the world that makes all classes "happy" and "harmless." What kind of Peking opera does China's Khrushchev find the most "happy" and "harmless"? The most representative one is the obscene "The Dragon Plays with the Phoenix." He personally ordered it to be made into a large-scale play. China's Khrushchev sings the tune of "harmless art," waving the banner of "entertainment and rest," and using the excuse of "different tastes" to resist the reform of Peking opera. This is to use bad plays like "The Dragon Plays with the Phoenix" to corrupt the souls of workers, peasants, and soldiers, encourage capitalist enthusiasm, and let people unknowingly walk the path of peaceful evolution in "entertainment and rest."

III

During the period of temporary economic difficulties caused by the three years of natural disasters, the remaining capitalist forces in the country launched an attack on socialism, and the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries abroad launched an anti-China chorus. At this time, China's Khrushchev's activities to use old Peking opera for capitalist restoration also reached a very rampant level.

During this period, China's Khrushchev vigorously advocated for new historical dramas, using the past to criticize the present, attacking the socialist system and proletarian dictatorship, and attacking the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao. He shouted: "We need to write more new historical dramas," "to help us summarize experience." Thus, dramas like "The Dismissal of Hai Rui," "Li Huimeng," "Xie Yaohuan," "Sun Andong's Lawsuit," and "Hai Rui's Memorial" all came out under the banner of "new historical dramas." These dramas of rehabilitation, dismissal, false cases, ghost plays, and cursing the emperor are all big poisonous weeds against the Party and socialism, and all are poisonous arrows aimed at the proletarian dictatorship. For a time, the Peking opera stage was filled with the clashing of swords and the killing intent. The counter-revolutionary momentum was rampant.

What kind of "experience" does China's Khrushchev's so-called new historical dramas "help us summarize"? Originally, the "experience" propagated in the dramas is all "summarized" according to the counter-revolutionary political needs of China's Khrushchev, all the experience of China's Khrushchev's big wind of individual farming and rehabilitation, all the experience of "one curse and two dismissals." Look, China's Khrushchev shouted to "contract production to households"; the drama echoed: "The south is in misery and desolation, if the land is not withdrawn, it will not last long." China's Khrushchev shouted that "people who have the same views as Peng Dehuai... can be rehabilitated"; the drama followed: "False cases must be rectified." China's Khrushchev slandered the three years of natural disasters as "three parts natural disaster, seven parts man-made disaster"; the drama loudly responded: "The reason for the people's poverty is multifaceted, the first harm is that the officials are not suitable." China's Khrushchev even directly pointed the spearhead at the great leader Chairman Mao through the drama's "cursing the emperor to death." This is clearly using the past to criticize the present, pointing at the mulberry to curse the osmanthus! This is clearly using the corpse of feudalism to revive the ghost of capitalism!

China's Khrushchev also said: "This kind of historical drama 'has people who like it.'" We cannot help but ask, which class likes this anti-Party and anti-socialist black play? People like Peng Dehuai, who were dismissed from their posts, like the rightist opportunists, like the rehabilitation dramas that play the tune of "the soul returns" for them, inciting them to rise again. The overthrown reactionary ruling class likes it, likes the ghost dramas that sing the praises of reactionary ghosts full of "revenge," venting their counter-revolutionary feelings of hatred towards the proletarian dictatorship. They are simply crazy about it, crazy about it "watching and thinking non-stop, not only thinking but even feeling, sometimes angry, sometimes crying, pounding the chair and stomping their feet, sighing and lamenting." The capitalist roaders, traitors, spies, and untransformed landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, and rightists led by China's Khrushchev all find comfort in these dramas and draw spiritual strength from the counter-revolution. However, in the end, they can only be like carrying water in a bamboo basket, ending up with a shameful fate of eternal infamy!

In 1963 and 1964, Chairman Mao issued two extremely important instructions on literature and art, pointing out in a sharp and accurate manner that "many departments in the literary and art circles are still ruled by the 'dead,'" exposing the cover of class struggle in the literary and art circles, and sounding the death knell for the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and art black line with China's Khrushchev as the backstage boss. Comrade Jiang Qing, leading the revolutionary Peking opera workers, launched a fierce attack on the most stubborn stronghold of old Peking opera, blowing the charge for our proletarian cultural revolution.

China's Khrushchev sensed that his end was near, panicked, and played two counter-revolutionary tricks, trying to block the surging tide of the proletarian cultural revolution with Peking opera reform as a great beginning and save his doomed fate.

On the one hand, he retreated to attack, "proposing that new plays and old plays, modern plays and historical plays should coexist," saying that "we should regulate the proportion of ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign plays," "put historical plays and foreign plays in the second position." China's Khrushchev's reactionary fallacy of new plays and old plays sitting side by side is pure class conciliationism. What plays are performed on the stage is not a simple matter of play arrangement, but a matter of which class rules the stage, a life-and-death struggle between two classes and two lines in the ideological realm. We must thoroughly criticize and repudiate old plays that propagate feudalism and capitalism, and thoroughly establish revolutionary modern plays, drive all emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties off the Peking opera stage, and absolutely not let them "coexist." In fact, China's Khrushchev's so-called putting historical plays in the second position is actually using the method of temporary "retreat" to keep all the reactionary dramas of the landlords and bourgeoisie intact, waiting for a favorable opportunity to launch a full-scale counterattack and drive all revolutionary modern plays off the Peking opera stage.

On the other hand, he also used the method of "ideological infiltration and peaceful evolution" to try to transform revolutionary model operas with a revisionist face. He stuck his black hand into the creation of revolutionary model operas, maliciously changed the theme of the model operas, and castrated the revolutionary content of the model operas. For example, in the creation process of the revolutionary modern Peking opera "The Port," Comrade Jiang Qing clearly pointed out that it should express internationalist enthusiasm and create the image of heroic dock workers. While China's Khrushchev sang the opposite tune, using the banner of "cultivating successors" to peddle the black goods of the "middle character theory." He did not let the script praise heroic characters but described "the mediocre masses," letting backward youth who are dissatisfied with reality vent their grievances and talk nonsense on the stage. In a word, China's Khrushchev tried to turn the magnificent song of dock workers in the socialist era "The Port" into a farce that maliciously defames the working class.

Although China's Khrushchev harbored deep hatred for the reform of Peking opera, obstructed it in every way, and maliciously sabotaged it, the wheel of history rolled forward, the tide of Peking opera reform surged, and could not be stopped. Under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line on literature and art and the personal cultivation of Comrade Jiang Qing, one revolutionary model opera after another smashed China's Khrushchev's conspiracy to sabotage the reform of Peking opera, destroyed the prison of the revisionist literary and art black line, and broke out from the most stubborn stronghold. The red light illuminates the revolutionary path, the military and civilians fight bravely at Xijia Village, heroes cleverly capture Tiger Mountain, flying troops make a surprise attack on the White Tiger Regiment, the port is stormy and shows heroes... "The old drama has opened a new face," the revolutionary model operas have turned the upside-down history back over. From then on, the reactionary rule of emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties over the drama stage was ended, and the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and art black line was completely bankrupt. China's Khrushchev, the biggest obstacle to the reform of Peking opera, was finally knocked down. We must take Comrade Jiang Qing as an example, firmly carry out, implement, and defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line on literature and art, thoroughly eliminate all the poison spread by China's Khrushchev in the Peking opera circle. We must be like Yang Zhenrong in "The Capture of Tiger Mountain," who bravely fights with the spotted and ferocious tiger, knock down all the obstacles on the road of progress, and carry out the reform of Peking opera to the end.

    中国赫鲁晓夫是京剧革命最大的拦路虎
    空军直属机关　红雷
    中国赫鲁晓夫这个党内最大的走资派，是京剧革命最大的拦路虎。从全国解放前夕以来，每到阶级斗争的关键时刻，他都要跳出来，顽固地反对毛主席的革命文艺路线，反对京剧革命，把京剧舞台作为他复辟资本主义的一个重要阵地。
     一
    在新民主主义革命取得基本胜利后，中国向何处去？是走社会主义道路，还是走资本主义道路？这是摆在中国人民面前的首要问题。伟大领袖毛主席在七届二中全会上发出“把中国建设成一个伟大的社会主义国家”的号召。在这个历史转折关头，中国赫鲁晓夫急急忙忙地跳出来，大肆鼓吹走资本主义道路，反对社会主义革命。在戏剧方面，他公然反对毛主席为戏曲改革提出的“百花齐放，推陈出新”的方针，反对改造旧戏曲，反对禁演坏戏，一开始就企图把戏剧的发展拉向资本主义轨道。
    当时，在刚刚解放了的城市，帝国主义、封建主义的反动戏剧充斥着舞台。根据广大革命群众的要求，全国有不少城市和地区采取了禁演坏戏的革命措施。中国赫鲁晓夫对此极为不满，公然反对禁演坏戏。一九四九年四月，他在天津的讲话中叫嚷：“天津禁了些旧剧，使人少吃饭，不吃饭，人家不满意，有问题还要我们解决，这是干了蠢事”，“宣传封建，不怕，几千年了，我们不是胜利了？”上海解放前夕，他对将进上海的反革命修正主义分子夏衍说：“怕什么？过去上海演了那么多坏戏，共产党不是也得了天下么？”从这些叫嚣中，可见他对那些坏戏是多么的眷恋关切，而对禁演坏戏的革命措施又是多么的恼怒忌恨！
    演坏戏，共产党也得了天下。这是中国赫鲁晓夫为坏戏张目的极端反动的黑话。伟大领袖毛主席在七届二中全会上指出：“必须学会在城市中向帝国主义者、国民党、资产阶级作政治斗争、经济斗争和文化斗争”；“如果我们不去注意这些问题，不去学会同这些人作这些斗争，并在斗争中取得胜利，我们就不能维持政权，我们就会站不住脚，我们就会失败。”禁演坏戏，打击反动文化，正是我们在城市中同帝国主义、国民党、资产阶级进行的一场严重的文化斗争，这场斗争是关系到我们能不能巩固政权的大事，是关系到得天下还是失天下的大事。中国赫鲁晓夫胡说什么：演坏戏，共产党也得了天下，就是要我们放弃这场严重的斗争，要把那些反动透顶的封建主义、资本主义文化原封不动地保留下来，作为反动统治阶级向人民大众反扑的宣传工具，作为他阴谋复辟资本主义的舆论阵地。
    中国赫鲁晓夫反对禁演坏戏，还打着一个“人人有饭吃”的旗号。什么“禁了些旧剧，使人少吃饭，不吃饭”呀，“大家有饭吃，就好”呀，等等。这种谬论，是对党的文化政策最无耻的污蔑。我们禁演的是坏戏，而不是禁止演戏。解放以后，一切过去为地主、资产阶级服务的旧艺人、旧剧团都面临着一个自我改造的问题。他们吃人民的饭，就要为无产阶级政治服务，为工农兵服务。他们演革命的戏，我们不但不禁，而且积极鼓励，大力支持，给他们为工农兵服务的最充分的自由。如果按照中国赫鲁晓夫的一套去做，让坏戏自由泛滥，就是让他们吃人民的饭，干毒害人民的事，吃社会主义的饭，为复辟资本主义服务。让被推翻的反动阶级卷土重来，不仅广大劳动人民将重新陷入被压迫、被剥削的深渊，而这些艺人和剧团，也将重新依赖资产阶级的钱袋而生活，倒是真正的没饭吃。中国赫鲁晓夫要工人哀求资本家“剥削一下，我就有饭吃”。要舞女继续卖弄色情，说什么这样做“好处在舞女有饭吃，有钱的人有地方花。”真是无耻至极，反动透顶！在“人人有饭吃”的幌子下，中国赫鲁晓夫要保护的是一切麻醉人民的反动戏剧、反动文化。他梦想恢复的是剥削者的天堂，劳动人民的地狱。
    二
    一九五六年，我国生产资料所有制方面的社会主义改造基本完成，资产阶级失去了他们赖以安身立命的经济基础，但还在利用他们所把持的思想、文化阵地进行拚死的反抗，国内阶级斗争相当激烈。国际上出现了赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团，帝国主义乘机掀起了反共高潮，一时恶浪滚滚，妖雾迷漫。在这一关键时刻，中国赫鲁晓夫又一次跳了出来，变本加厉地反对京剧改革，为牛鬼蛇神出笼大开方便之门，为复辟资本主义积极奔走呼号。
    苏修二十大刚刚收场，中国赫鲁晓夫就紧密配合，系统地提出了反革命修正主义文艺纲领。他狂妄地把
  “百花齐放，推陈出新”的方针歪曲为“允许并存”，“各搞各的”，强调“出新不能勉强”，极力为封建主义、资本主义的反动戏剧继续盘踞京剧舞台张目。他甚至明目张胆地为解放以来已经禁演的坏戏解除禁演令。霎时间，《四郎探母》、《游龙戏凤》、《封神榜》等叛徒戏、色情戏、神怪戏，一个个重新登台。
    在生产资料所有制的社会主义改造取得基本胜利之后，京剧要不要改革，这是关系到把社会主义革命进行到底还是半途而废的大问题，是关系到社会主义江山变不变颜色的大问题。毛主席教导我们：“一定的文化（当作观念形态的文化）是一定社会的政治和经济的反映，又给予伟大影响和作用于一定社会的政治和经济”。中国赫鲁晓夫在生产资料所有制的社会主义改造基本完成后，还要胡说什么：“戏改不要大改”，“出新不要勉强”，以种种努力保护旧京剧使之免于死亡，以腐朽的旧文化来破坏社会主义的经济基础，动摇无产阶级专政。
      “有些老戏很有教育意义”。这是中国赫鲁晓夫为反对京剧改革而抬出的一块挡箭牌。所谓“教育意义”是有具体的阶级内容的。他推崇最力、捧得最高的是些什么东西呢？《四郎探母》是宣扬叛徒哲学、活命哲学的；《恶虎村》是美化封建地主走狗、叛徒黄天霸的。原来他说的“教育意义”，是叛徒教育、汉奸教育、奴才教育，地主、资产阶级的教育。
    中国赫鲁晓夫为什么特别在一九五六年大力宣扬《四郎探母》、《恶虎村》呢？联系到他自己的反动历史和当时的政治背景就不难明白。他是要通过美化戏剧舞台上的叛徒形象为政治舞台上的叛徒涂脂抹粉，为国际共产主义运动的叛徒赫鲁晓夫喝采叫好，为他自己和他卵翼下的叛徒集团开脱罪责。《四郎探母》中的叛徒杨四郎唱出了叛徒的心声。中国赫鲁晓夫宣扬在白色恐怖下“可以写自首书”，苏联赫鲁晓夫鼓吹“脑袋掉了，原则有什么用”，杨四郎表白：“吾既被擒，死亦无益于国，不如应允，留在他国”，又何其相似乃尔！中国赫鲁晓夫正是通过杨四郎来贩卖“叛徒哲学”、“活命哲学”，以便对无产阶级革命事业进行大背叛、大出卖。
      “京剧艺术水平很高，不能轻视，不能乱改”。这是中国赫鲁晓夫反对京剧改革的另一块挡箭牌。他公开号召：象《梅龙镇》、《二进宫》、《四郎探母》，也要“把技术留下来，继承艺术成果”。在这里，他只讲艺术水平，不讲政治思想，完全抹煞了艺术的阶级性。毛主席教导我们：“有些政治上根本反动的东西，也可能有某种艺术性。内容愈反动的作品而又愈带艺术性，就愈能毒害人民，就愈应该排斥。”中国赫鲁晓夫赞不绝口的所谓“艺术水平高”“技术性强”的旧京剧，或则是内容反动，或则是极端下流的坏戏。如《四郎探母》，就是由清朝统治者慈禧太后等人，为了招降纳叛的政治需要亲自指导精心加工的。日本帝国主义也极力称赞它的“艺术水平”。这样的“艺术”，水平愈高，对人民的危害愈大，我们愈应该排斥。
    “无害的，都可允许演”。这是中国赫鲁晓夫反对京剧改革的又一块挡箭牌。他振振有词地说：“观众口味是不同”，“看了戏能得到休息，使人高兴”，“就鼓励了社会主义积极性了”。毛主席早就指出：“在现在世界上，一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。”世界上从来不存在什么使各个阶级看了都“高兴”，对各个阶级都“无害”的超阶级的艺术。中国赫鲁晓夫看了最“高兴”，觉得最“无害”的京剧是什么呢？荒淫下流的《游龙戏凤》就是最有代表性的一个。他亲自下令把它搞成大型戏。中国赫鲁晓夫高唱“无害文艺”的滥调，打着“娱乐、休息”的招牌，搬出“口味不同”的借口，来抵制京剧改革，就是要用《游龙戏凤》之类的坏戏，来腐蚀工农兵的灵魂，鼓励资本主义的积极性，让人们在“娱乐、休息”之中，不知不觉地走上和平演变的道路。三
    在三年自然灾害造成的暂时经济困难时期，国内残余资本主义势力向社会主义的进攻达到了高潮，国外帝、修、反掀起了反华大合唱。这时中国赫鲁晓夫利用旧京剧进行资本主义复辟的活动也达到了十分猖狂的地步。
    在这一时期，中国赫鲁晓夫十分起劲地鼓吹新编历史剧，以借古讽今，攻击社会主义制度和无产阶级专政，攻击以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部。他叫嚷：“要多编一些新历史剧”，“帮助我们总结经验”。于是，什么《海瑞罢官》、《李慧娘》、《谢瑶环》、《孙安动本》、《海瑞上疏》等等，都打着“新编历史剧”的招牌，纷纷出笼了。这些翻案戏、罢官戏、冤狱戏、鬼戏、骂皇帝戏，一个个都是反党反社会主义的大毒草，一支支都是射向无产阶级专政的毒箭。一时京剧舞台上刀光剑影，杀气腾腾。反革命气焰，甚嚣尘上。
    中国赫鲁晓夫所谓新编历史剧“可以帮助我们总结经验”，究竟是什么货色呢？原来戏中所宣传的“经验”，都是按照中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命政治需要“总结”的，都是中国赫鲁晓夫大刮单干风、翻案风的经验的总结，都是“一骂二罢”的经验的总结。你看，中国赫鲁晓夫叫嚷要“包产到户”；戏中就随声附和：“江南困苦凄凉相，不退占田不久长”。中国赫鲁晓夫叫嚷“和彭德怀有相同观点的人……可以翻案”；戏中就跟着帮腔：“冤狱重重要平反”。中国赫鲁晓夫把三年自然灾害诬蔑为“三分天灾，七分人祸”；戏中就大声呼应“民穷之故多端，大抵官不得其人为第一之害。”中国赫鲁晓夫甚至通过戏中“把皇上骂苦了”之类的叫嚣，直接把矛头指向伟大领袖毛主席。这不明明是借古讽今，指桑骂槐！这不明明是在借封建主义之僵尸，还资本主义之阴魂！
    中国赫鲁晓夫还口口声声说：这种历史剧“有人喜欢”。我们不禁要问，是哪个阶级才喜欢这种反党反社会主义的黑戏呢？象彭德怀那样被罢了官的右倾机会主义分子是喜欢的，喜欢那种翻案戏为他们弹起“魂兮归来”的曲子，鼓动他们东山再起。被推翻的反动统治阶级是喜欢的，喜欢那种鬼戏歌颂了满怀“复仇之志”的反动厉鬼，发泄了他们仇恨无产阶级专政的反革命感情。他们简直喜欢得发了疯，喜欢得“一面看，一面脑子里转个不停，不但动思想，甚至动感情，有时动肝火，有时掉眼泪，捶椅顿脚，唉声叹气”。中国赫鲁晓夫为首的走资派、叛徒、特务、没有改造好的地富反坏右，他们都从这些戏中得到安慰，吸取反革命的精神力量。不过，到头来，他们也只能是竹篮提水一场空，落个遗臭万年的可耻下场！四一九六三年和一九六四年，毛主席接连发出了关于文学艺术的两个极为重要的批示，一针见血地指出文艺界“许多部门至今还是‘死人’统治着”，揭开了文艺界阶级斗争的盖子，敲响了以中国赫鲁晓夫为总后台的反革命修正主义文艺黑线的丧钟。敬爱的江青同志，率领革命的京剧工作者，向旧京剧这个最顽固的堡垒展开最猛烈的进攻，吹响了我国无产阶级文化大革命的进军号。
    中国赫鲁晓夫预感到末日即将来临，惊恐万状，大耍反革命的两手策略，妄想阻挡以京剧革命为伟大开端的无产阶级文化大革命的滚滚洪流，挽救自己行将灭亡的命运。
    他一方面以退为攻，“提出新戏和老戏、现代戏和历史戏“同时并存”，说什么：“要规定一下剧目的古今中外比例”，“把历史剧、外国剧放到第二位去。”中国赫鲁晓夫这种新戏老戏并排坐的反动谬论是十足的阶级调和主义。舞台上演什么戏，绝不是一个简单的剧目安排问题，而是哪个阶级统治舞台的问题，是两个阶级、两条路线在意识形态领域里的生死搏斗。我们就是要大破宣传封建主义、资本主义的旧戏，大立宣传社会主义的革命现代戏，要把帝王将相、才子佳人从京剧舞台上通通赶下去，决不能和它“同时并存”。其实，中国赫鲁晓夫所谓把历史剧放到第二位去，实际上是用暂时“退却”的方式，把一切地主、资产阶级的反动戏剧完整地保存下来，等待时机有利，来一个全面反攻，把革命现代戏从京剧舞台上全部打下去。
    另一方面，他还采用“思想渗透、和平演变”的办法，力图以修正主义的面貌来改造革命样板戏。他把黑手伸到革命样板戏的创作中去，恶意篡改样板戏的主题思想，阉割样板戏的革命内容。如在革命现代京剧《海港》的创作过程中，江青同志明确指出，要抒发国际主义豪情，要塑造码头工人的英雄形象。而中国赫鲁晓夫则大唱反调，打着“培养接班人”的幌子，贩卖“中间人物论”的黑货。他不让剧本歌颂英雄人物，却去描写“中不溜儿的芸芸众生”，让对现实不满的落后青年在舞台上大发牢骚，大讲怪话。一句话，中国赫鲁晓夫妄图把《海港》这一曲社会主义时代码头工人的壮丽颂歌，变成一出肆意丑化工人阶级的丑剧。
    尽管中国赫鲁晓夫对京剧革命刻骨仇恨，百般阻挠，恶毒破坏，但是，历史的车轮滚滚向前，京剧革命的洪流汹涌澎湃，势不可挡，革命的新生事物终究要战胜反动腐朽的东西。在毛主席革命文艺路线的光辉指引下，在江青同志的亲手培育下，一出出革命样板戏，粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫破坏京剧革命的阴谋，摧毁了修正主义文艺黑线的牢笼，从最顽固的堡垒中冲杀了出来。红灯照亮革命路，军民奋战沙家浜，英雄智取威虎山，飞兵奇袭白虎团，海港风云显英雄……。“旧剧开了新生面”，革命样板戏把被颠倒了的历史再颠倒了过来。从此结束了帝王将相、才子佳人对戏剧舞台的反动统治，宣判了反革命修正主义文艺黑线的彻底破产。中国赫鲁晓夫这只京剧革命最大的拦路虎，也终于被打翻在地。我们一定要以江青同志为榜样，坚决贯彻、执行、保卫毛主席的革命文艺路线，彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫在京剧界散布的一切流毒。要象《智取威虎山》中和斑斓猛虎英勇搏斗的杨子荣那样，打倒横在前进道路上的一切拦路虎，把京剧革命进行到底。
