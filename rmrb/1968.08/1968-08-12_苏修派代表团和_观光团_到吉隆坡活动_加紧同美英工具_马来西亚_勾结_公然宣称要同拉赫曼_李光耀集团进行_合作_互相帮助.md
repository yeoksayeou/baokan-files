Soviet Revisionist Delegation and "Tourist Group" in Kuala Lumpur Activities
Intensifying Ties with the U.S.-British Puppet "Malaysia"
Openly Declaring Cooperation and Mutual Assistance with the Rahman-Lee Kuan Yew Clique

New China News Agency, August 6th: According to reports from Singapore newspapers, the Soviet revisionist clique recently sent several delegations to "Malaysia" to engage in activities, intensifying their political, economic, and cultural collusion with the U.S.-British imperialist puppet Rahman-Lee Kuan Yew clique, and carrying out anti-communist, anti-Chinese, and anti-people crimes.

A Soviet revisionist "trade delegation" arrived in "Malaysia" on July 22nd and stayed for over ten days. During their time in Kuala Lumpur, this delegation held multiple talks with officials from the "Malaysia" puppet regime and had extensive contact with local capitalists. The head of the Soviet revisionist delegation announced that the Soviet Union will hold a "Soviet Industrial and Commercial Exhibition" in Kuala Lumpur in September and declared that they will "cooperate," "mutually assist," and "mutually visit" with the reactionary government and capitalists of "Malaysia."

In late July, the Soviet revisionist clique also sent a "tourist group" to "Malaysia." The head of this delegation shamelessly shouted about establishing and developing so-called "cultural and scientific relations" with the Rahman-Lee Kuan Yew clique.

This Soviet revisionist "tourist group" is now active in the Philippines. Previously, the Philippine government only allowed Soviet delegations sponsored by the United Nations to enter the country. Now, due to the blatant collusion between the Soviet revisionist clique and U.S. imperialism, the Philippine government has adopted a new policy, allowing the Soviet revisionist "tourist group" to enter for the first time.

　　苏修派代表团和“观光团”到吉隆坡活动
　　加紧同美英工具“马来西亚”勾结
　　公然宣称要同拉赫曼—李光耀集团进行“合作”“互相帮助”
    新华社六日讯　据新加坡报纸报道，苏修叛徒集团最近又派遣一些代表团到“马来西亚”活动，加紧同美英帝国主义的工具拉赫曼—李光耀傀儡集团在政治、经济和文化上的勾结，进行反共、反华、反人民的罪恶活动。
    一个苏修“贸易代表团”，在七月二十二日到“马来西亚”活动了十多天。这个代表团在吉隆坡期间，同“马来西亚”傀儡集团的官员进行了多次会谈，并与当地的资本家进行了广泛的接触。苏修代表团的头子宣布，苏修将于今年九月间在吉隆坡举办“苏联工商业展览会”，并宣称要同“马来西亚”反动当局和资本家“合作”，“互相帮助”和“互相访问”。
    苏修叛徒集团在七月下旬还派了一个“观光团”到“马来西亚”活动。代表团的头子不知羞耻地叫嚷要同拉赫曼—李光耀集团建立和发展所谓“文化和科学关系”。
    这个苏修“观光团”现在已到菲律宾活动。过去菲律宾政府只允许联合国赞助的苏联代表团入境，现在，由于苏修集团同美帝国主义的全面勾结已十分露骨，菲律宾政府采取了新的政策，第一次允许苏修“观光团”入境。
