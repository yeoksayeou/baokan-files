	Looking back at the battles we have fought, we deeply feel that every time we resolutely carry out the orders of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and resolutely act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, we feel clear-headed and have a direction, and the revolutionary struggle can develop smoothly and achieve continuous victories. Every time we do not study Chairman Mao's instructions seriously and implement them resolutely, we feel aimless and without direction, and the revolutionary struggle will suffer setbacks and failures. The practice of struggle tells us: the deeper the revolution goes and the closer it gets to victory, the sharper and more complex the class struggle becomes. The proletarian revolutionaries must be infinitely loyal to the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao. Every one of Chairman Mao's latest instructions must be carried out resolutely and implemented thoroughly.

	At the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao's big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters" sounded the battle call for a full-scale attack on the bourgeois headquarters led by the Chinese Khrushchev. All the revolutionary workers in our factory acted swiftly, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and along the direction indicated by Chairman Mao's "Bombard the Headquarters," we raised the banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against the reactionaries" and launched a fierce attack on the bourgeois headquarters. At that time, the Chinese Khrushchev's agent in Tianjin stubbornly pushed the bourgeois reactionary line in our factory, suppressing the revolutionary masses and attempting to extinguish the flames of revolution. We seriously studied Chairman Mao's big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters" and firmly followed Chairman Mao's battle orders, uniting as one and fighting against the enemy together. After repeated struggles, we finally broke through the numerous obstacles of the bourgeois reactionary line and achieved great victories in the revolutionary struggle. The fundamental reason for our victory was that all the revolutionary workers in our factory could resolutely act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, directing the spearhead of the struggle firmly at the bourgeois headquarters led by the Chinese Khrushchev and their agents in Tianjin, with clear targets and fierce firepower, leaving the class enemies no place to hide. The revolutionary masses all deeply felt that the ferocity of the enemy is not to be feared, but what is to be feared is that we do not follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and cannot resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions.

	Last year, after a hard struggle, the proletarian revolutionaries in our factory achieved victory in the struggle for power. In the midst of a great situation, some comrades in our ranks forgot Chairman Mao's teaching to "continue to maintain a humble, prudent, modest, and unhurried style," gradually nurturing bourgeois individualism, and small-groupism and factionalism began to develop. At this time, the class enemies took advantage of the bourgeois factionalism of some people in the revolutionary ranks and spread the reactionary idea of "me first," using it to split and disintegrate the revolutionary ranks. At that time, more than twenty mass organizations in our factory attacked each other every day for the interests of small groups, with "internal wars" unending, and on the issue of revolutionary great unity, everyone said they were revolutionary rebels and that unity must be "me first." For the positions of members of the revolutionary committee of the factory, they argued for a long time but still could not reach an agreement.

	Just at this time, Chairman Mao's latest instructions were issued: "Within the proletariat, there is no fundamental conflict of interests. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason to split into two irreconcilable factions." Chairman Mao's instructions struck the hearts of the broad masses. The broad workers all expressed that the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin is our only leadership center, and we must resolutely carry out the orders of this leadership center. We cannot have "me first"; if we continue this way, we will fall into the trap of the class enemies and go astray. We must eliminate the small factions and achieve revolutionary great unity to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. With the help of the PLA's leftist cadres, we seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's latest instructions. As a result, it only took four days to reach an agreement and achieve revolutionary great unity throughout the factory. Soon, the revolutionary committee of the factory was established. Since then, under the leadership of the revolutionary committee, all the workers in the factory have closely united and followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, resolutely carrying out all the instructions of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, making the revolution advance step by step and production rise steadily.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never reconcile themselves to their defeat; they will make their last struggle." In the face of the great situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution's continuous victories, if we do not criticize the "multi-center theory," it will interfere with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and disrupt the implementation of the proletarian revolutionary line. Therefore, at the crucial moment of achieving the overall victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must severely criticize the "multi-center theory." The so-called "multi-center theory" is essentially "me first," placing personal interests and the interests of small groups above the overall interests of the proletariat. Towards the voice from the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, we listen to what is beneficial to me and do not listen to what is not beneficial to me. Everything is judged by me as the standard. In this way, it is easy for the class enemies to take the opportunity to sow discord and disrupt the unity of the proletarian revolutionaries under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao. Before our factory achieved revolutionary great unity, it was in this situation, resulting in both revolution and production suffering losses. This is our deepest lesson.

	Now, under the leadership of the revolutionary committee of the factory, the proletarian revolutionaries can resolutely carry out all the instructions of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, achieving immediate action upon orders and stopping upon prohibitions. Therefore, both revolution and production have taken on a new appearance.

	To achieve the overall victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our factory recently opened a Mao Zedong Thought study class to severely criticize the "multi-center theory," determined to thoroughly sweep away the bourgeois ideological influence in our minds, forever be loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, forever be loyal to the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, and closely unite around this highest headquarters. We will do as Chairman Mao says. We will carry out what we understand and also carry out what we do not understand for the time being, deepening our understanding in the process of implementation. We must actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, accelerate the revolutionization of our thinking, and strive to be models in carrying out Chairman Mao's instructions.

　　对毛主席的最新指示要坚决照办彻底执行
　　天津国棉二厂革命委员会
    回顾以往所走过的战斗历程，使我们深深体会到：每当我们坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级司令部的命令，坚决按照毛主席的指示办事的时候，就感到心明眼亮，有方向，革命斗争就能顺利发展，不断取得胜利；每当我们对毛主席的指示学得不认真，贯彻执行得不坚决的时候，就感到心无主张，没有方向，革命斗争就会受到挫折和失败。斗争的实践告诉我们：革命越是深入，越是接近胜利，阶级斗争越是尖锐、复杂，无产阶级革命派越要无限忠于以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部。对毛主席的每一个最新指示，都要坚决照办，彻底执行。
    在无产阶级文化大革命初期，毛主席《炮打司令部》的大字报，吹响了向以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部展开全面进攻的战斗号角，我们全厂革命职工雷厉风行，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，沿着毛主席《炮打司令部》所指引的方向，高举“对反动派造反有理”的大旗，向资产阶级司令部发起了猛烈的进攻。当时，中国赫鲁晓夫在天津的代理人，在我厂顽固推行资产阶级反动路线，镇压革命群众，妄图将革命的烈火扑灭。我们认真学习了毛主席《炮打司令部》的大字报，坚定不移地按照毛主席的战斗号令，团结一致，共同对敌。经过一次又一次的斗争，我们终于冲破了资产阶级反动路线的重重阻碍，取得了革命斗争的伟大胜利。胜利的根本原因，就是我们全厂革命职工能坚决按照毛主席的指示办事，把斗争的矛头紧紧对准以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部及其在天津的代理人，目标准、火力猛，使阶级敌人无处藏身。革命群众都深有体会地说：敌人的凶恶并不可怕，就怕我们不紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，不能坚定不移地执行毛主席的一系列最新指示。
    去年，我们厂的无产阶级革命派经过艰苦斗争，取得夺权斗争的胜利。在一片大好形势下，我们队伍中的某些同志，忘记了毛主席“继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风”的教导，慢慢滋长了资产阶级个人主义思想，小团体主义、山头主义有了发展。这时，阶级敌人就利用革命队伍中某些人的资产阶级派性，极力散布“以我为中心”的反动思想，用来分裂、瓦解革命队伍。那一阵，我们全厂二十多个群众组织，为了小团体的利益，整天互相攻击，“内战”不休，在革命大联合问题上，都说自己是革命造反派，要联合必须“以我为中心”。为了厂革命委员会委员名额争来争去，谈判了很长时间，还是谈不拢。
    正在这时，毛主席的最新指示发表了：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”毛主席的指示，说到广大群众的心坎里。广大职工纷纷表示：以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部是我们唯一的领导中心，我们一定要坚决贯彻执行这个领导中心的号令。不能搞“以我为中心”，再这样搞下去就要中了阶级敌人的奸计，走上歪路。我们必须铲除小山头，实现革命大联合，才能紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。在解放军支左人员的帮助下，我们认真学习了毛主席的最新指示，坚决执行毛主席的最新指示，结果只用了四天时间，就达成了协议，实现了全厂的革命的大联合。不久，便成立了厂革命委员会。从那以后，在革命委员会的领导下，全厂职工紧紧团结在一起，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚决贯彻执行以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的各项指示，使革命步步深入，生产直线上升。
    毛主席教导我们：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”在无产阶级文化大革命节节胜利的大好形势下，如果不批判“多中心论”，它就会干扰毛主席的伟大战略部署，破坏无产阶级革命路线的贯彻执行。所以，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的关键时刻，我们一定要狠狠批判“多中心论”。所谓“多中心论”，实质上就是“以我为中心”，把个人利益、小集团的利益摆在无产阶级的整体利益之上。对来自毛主席的无产阶级司令部的声音，有利于我的就听得进去，不利于我的就听不进去。事事以我为标准，这样，很容易使阶级敌人趁机进行挑拨离间，破坏无产阶级革命派在以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部领导下的团结。我们厂在没有实现革命大联合之前，就是这种情况，结果使革命和生产都受到损失。这是我们最深刻的教训。
    现在，在厂革命委员会的领导下，无产阶级革命派能够坚决贯彻执行以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的各项指示，做到有令即行，有禁则止。所以，革命和生产都出现了新的面貌。
    为了夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，最近，我们厂又开办了狠批“多中心论”的毛泽东思想学习班，决心彻底扫清我们头脑中的资产阶级的思想影响，永远忠于伟大领袖毛主席，永远忠于以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，紧紧团结在这个最高司令部的周围，毛主席怎么说，我们就怎么做。理解的要执行，暂时不理解的也要执行，在执行过程中加深理解。我们一定要活学活用毛泽东思想，加速思想革命化，争当执行毛主席指示的模范。
