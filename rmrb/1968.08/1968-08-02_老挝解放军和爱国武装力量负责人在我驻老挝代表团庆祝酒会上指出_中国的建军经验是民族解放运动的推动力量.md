The leaders of the Lao People's Liberation Army and the Patriotic Armed Forces spoke at the reception held by the Chinese Economic and Cultural Representative Office in Laos to celebrate the 41st anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

KANGOI, August 1 (Xinhua) - The Chinese Economic and Cultural Representative Office in Laos held a reception on July 30 to warmly celebrate the 41st anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

	Guests invited to the reception included General Sipaseuth of the Lao People's Liberation Army Khamouane Military Region, General Singkapo, Commander-in-Chief Dun of the Military Command of the Lao Patriotic Neutral Forces, and representatives from relevant departments and units of the two patriotic forces, as well as officers, combat heroes, and representatives of militia and guerrilla forces.

	Representatives from the Vietnamese Economic and Cultural Representative Office in Laos were also invited to the reception.

	Yang Zemin, the head of the Chinese Economic and Cultural Representative Office in Laos, spoke first at the reception. He said: The Chinese People's Liberation Army was personally founded and led by the great leader Chairman Mao, and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin Biao. It is a new-type army that serves the people wholeheartedly. It is absolutely loyal to the great commander Chairman Mao, absolutely loyal to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. It has a high level of political awareness and self-discipline, and possesses the heroic spirit of overcoming all enemies and fearing no sacrifices and hardships.

	He said, under the direct command of Vice Chairman Lin Biao, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasized proletarian politics, insisted on the Four Firsts, promoted the Three-Eight Style, practiced the Three Great Democracies, created the Four Good Units, greatly promoted the proletarianization, revolutionization, and combat readiness of our army, cultivated a large number of heroes and new people of communism, and set a brilliant example for the whole nation to study and apply Chairman Mao's works.

	Yang Zemin said, Chairman Mao's brilliant instruction that "the People's Liberation Army should be a great school" is the development of Chairman Mao's consistent military thought under new historical conditions and is the eternal guideline for our military construction. This has great historical significance for consolidating our proletarian dictatorship, ensuring the victory of our socialist revolution and socialist construction, and making our army forever maintain the character of the people's army.

	He said, the Chinese People's Liberation Army is the pillar of proletarian dictatorship. Today, the People's Liberation Army has made new great contributions in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	Yang Zemin warmly praised the great victories achieved by the people of Laos and Vietnam in their struggle against American aggression for national salvation. He expressed that the seven hundred million Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought and tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, firmly support the struggle of the people of Laos and Vietnam against American aggression for national salvation until they achieve final victory.

	Following that, General Sipaseuth and Colonel Dun spoke at the reception.

	General Sipaseuth pointed out in his speech that the past 41 years have been 41 years of heroic struggle by the Chinese People's Liberation Army under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party led by Chairman Mao. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has, since its inception, always held high the banner of revolution, grown and strengthened in the course of struggle, work, and construction, and achieved continuous victories. He praised the Chinese People's Liberation Army for its close ties with the people, unwavering loyalty to the people, and the support and backing of the people, becoming an invincible force.

	He said, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has accumulated extremely precious experience in building armed forces and waging armed struggle, which is a great driving force for the national liberation movements in Asia and the world.

	General Sipaseuth finally expressed that the Lao patriotic military and people will continue to unite as one, be determined, and thoroughly defeat American imperialism and its lackeys.

	Colonel Dun said in his speech: At present, the great seven hundred million Chinese people are successfully carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The Chinese People's Liberation Army has always established immortal merits in striving for the great victory of the Chinese revolution. We, the Lao Patriotic Neutral Forces, regard every victory of the Chinese military and people as a great support for our struggle against American aggression for national salvation. He said, the Chinese People's Liberation Army's insistence on the Four Firsts, promotion of the Three-Eight Style, practice of the Three Great Democracies, and creation of the Four Good Units are all good experiences for us to learn from. Colonel Dun warmly praised the current efforts of the Chinese People's Liberation Army to implement Chairman Mao's brilliant instruction that "the People's Liberation Army should be a great school" and achieve great successes. He wished the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese people greater victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	The reception was filled with an atmosphere of unity and friendship. The hosts and guests frequently raised their glasses to toast to the long life of Chairman Mao!
