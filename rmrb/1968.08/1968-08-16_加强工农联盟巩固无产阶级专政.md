	At the moment when we are celebrating the tenth anniversary of the great leader Chairman Mao's inspection of the Lugu Bridge People's Commune on August 13, Chairman Mao has issued a new directive: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully bring into play the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in all work. The working class must also raise its political consciousness in the course of struggle." We are overjoyed and feel extremely fortunate. We shout a thousand and ten thousand times: Long live Chairman Mao! Wish Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!

	For a long time, the Chinese Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the old Beijing Municipal Committee headed by Peng Zhen and Liu Ren, along with their agents in Fengtai District, have been pushing counter-revolutionary revisionist goods in the countryside, obstructing the implementation of Chairman Mao's directives. They have destroyed the worker-peasant alliance, spreading such reactionary fallacies as "a pound of vegetables sold for an extra cent, both to eat and to wear" and "half a plot of garlic is better than eight grades of labor, half an acre of scallions is better than an eighth-grade worker." They attempt to widen the gap between workers and peasants and sow discord between them. We say that worker big brothers manufacture machines to support agriculture, but they blather on about "buying with money, selling and buying," and even go so far as to say "workers are fed by peasants." This is sheer nonsense! We poor and lower-middle peasants and the working class are like brothers. No class enemy can destroy the worker-peasant alliance!

	Chairman Mao has long taught us: "People's democratic dictatorship requires the leadership of the working class. Because only the working class has the far-sightedness, selflessness, and thoroughness of revolution. The entire history of revolution proves that without the leadership of the working class, the revolution will fail, and with the leadership of the working class, the revolution will be victorious." Today, Chairman Mao has issued a new directive regarding the working class, and we, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, enthusiastically welcome the issuance of this new directive. Over the past ten years, our commune has undergone tremendous changes. Now we have electric wells for water, tractors for plowing, trucks for transportation, pesticides for pest control, and even mechanized feed processing. All of this is inseparable from the active support of our worker big brothers. We poor and lower-middle peasants resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words and will, under the leadership of the working class, closely unite around the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, thoroughly purge the poisonous influence of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line pushed by the Chinese Khrushchev, strengthen the worker-peasant alliance, consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, grasp the revolution, promote production, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. All the poor and lower-middle peasants of Luogu Bridge Commune, Yuegezhuang Brigade, and Xiaotun Brigade

### 加强工农联盟巩固无产阶级专政

    加强工农联盟巩固无产阶级专政编辑同志：
    正当我们在欢庆伟大领袖毛主席“八·一三”亲临视察芦沟桥人民公社十周年的光辉日子里，伟大领袖毛主席又发出了最新指示：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”我们打心眼里感到特别高兴，特别幸福，千遍万遍地高呼：毛主席万岁！祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    长期以来，中国赫鲁晓夫和以彭真、刘仁为首的旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团及其在丰台区的代理人，在农村推行反革命修正主义黑货，抵制毛主席指示的贯彻落实。他们破坏工农联盟，散布什么
  “一斤菜多卖一厘钱，又有吃来又有穿”和“二级半不如一畦蒜，八级工不如半亩葱”等种田为己的反动谬论，妄图扩大工农差别，挑拨工农关系。我们说工人老大哥制造机器支援农业，它们却胡说什么“是花钱买的，有卖有买”，还胡扯什么“工人是农民养活的”，这纯粹是满嘴喷粪！我们贫下中农和工人阶级是亲兄弟，任何阶级敌人休想破坏工农联盟！
    毛主席早就教导我们：“人民民主专政需要工人阶级的领导。因为只有工人阶级最有远见，大公无私，最富于革命的彻底性。整个革命历史证明，没有工人阶级的领导，革命就要失败，有了工人阶级的领导，革命就胜利了。”今天，毛主席又发出了关于工人阶级的最新指示，我们广大贫下中农社员，热烈欢呼这一最新指示的发表。十年来我们公社已经发生了巨大变化。现在是打水有电井，耕地有拖拉机，运输有汽车，治虫有农药，就连饲料加工也机械化了。这都与工人老大哥的积极支援分不开。我们贫下中农坚决听毛主席的话，一定要在工人阶级的领导下，紧紧团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的周围，彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫推行的反革命修正主义路线的流毒，加强工农联盟，巩固无产阶级专政，抓好革命，促好生产，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。芦沟桥公社岳各庄大队小屯大队全体贫下中农
