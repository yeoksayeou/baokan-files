The People's Daily reports: Just as the entire nation, both military and civilian, is celebrating the second anniversary of Chairman Mao's "Bombard the Headquarters" big-character poster and the "Sixteen Points" personally drafted by Chairman Mao with boundless love and loyalty for the great leader Chairman Mao, the comrades of the Beijing Workers and Peasants Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team have carefully studied the important editorial published in the People's Daily on August 5. Everyone unanimously expressed: This editorial conveys the voice of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. We must resolutely carry it out and thoroughly implement it. The comrades present decided to unite even more closely around Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters, thoroughly criticize the reactionary "multi-center theory," and resolutely carry out all the instructions of Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters. Under the command of the proletarian headquarters, we will unite our wills, steps, and actions to strive for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Chairman Mao's Proletarian Headquarters is the sole leadership center for the entire Party, the entire military, the entire nation, and all revolutionary masses.

Comrades participating in the discussion said: From our own experiences, we deeply understand that the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin is the sole leadership center for the entire Party, the entire military, the entire nation, and all revolutionary masses. It was formed through long-term arduous revolutionary struggles. It was the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao that led us to overthrow the three big mountains of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, achieving great victories in the people's revolution. It was the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao that led us to achieve tremendous successes in the socialist revolution and socialist construction. It was the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao that commanded us to smash the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev within our Party, achieving decisive victories in the Cultural Revolution. Decades of revolutionary struggle have formed a conviction in our hearts: Only Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters is the lifeline of all revolutionary people in our country. With its leadership, the revolution advances smoothly; without it, the revolution loses direction and suffers setbacks and failures. We have boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty for the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao. Anyone who dares to sabotage this revolutionary leadership center, we will fight to the end!

Zhang Laneng, a worker from Jushan Farm, said: The stars in the sky always face the North Star, and the sunflowers on the ground always face the sun. We poor and lower-middle peasants have only one center in our hearts: Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters. Long-term struggle practice tells us: As long as we resolutely follow the leadership of the proletarian headquarters and resolutely carry out every instruction of the proletarian headquarters, we can continuously achieve victories. Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have followed Chairman Mao's instructions: "One of our important tasks on the ideological front is to carry out a criticism of revisionism." We have severely criticized China's Khrushchev's fallacies of "material incentives" and the revisionist line of managing affairs, greatly raising everyone's class struggle consciousness and awareness of the two-line struggle. Comrades said: We must listen to Chairman Mao's words and resolutely follow the socialist road. Recently, during the busy fruit-picking season, our farm has another batch of comrades joining the Beijing Workers and Peasants Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team. Those left at the farm all expressed: This is a glorious task given to us by Chairman Mao, and we must resolutely complete it. Those left at the farm work late into the night every day, making the fruit-picking work quality better than in previous years and completing the tasks better than in previous years. This is the result of following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments and acting according to the instructions of the proletarian headquarters.

Chen Daqin, a cadre from the Beijing Power Supply Bureau, said: Under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution nationwide is excellent and getting better. The more profound and complex the class struggle is, the more a small handful of desperate class enemies will struggle to the end. The so-called "multi-center theory" is a reactionary theory of bourgeois factionalism and individualism. It disperses the unity of the revolutionary ranks based on Mao Zedong Thought and hinders the implementation of the proletarian revolutionary line. Anyone who insists on doing something "with me as the center" will easily be used by class enemies to sabotage the unity of our revolutionary ranks, achieving their goal of restoring capitalism, making us suffer twice the hardship and twice the misery. This is absolutely unacceptable. We must severely criticize the reactionary "multi-center theory" and sweep it into the dustbin of history.

The "multi-center theory" is a stumbling block to the advancement of the revolutionary cause.

Comrades participating in the discussion unanimously pointed out: The reactionary "multi-center theory" is an expression of bourgeois factionalism and individualism, a piece of revisionist junk. It disperses the unity of the revolutionary ranks based on Mao Zedong Thought, interferes with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, and hinders the implementation of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Some people advocate "with me as the center," always putting themselves first, acting as if they hold the truth, as if the world would stop without them. They place themselves above the Party and above the proletarian headquarters, essentially challenging the independence of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and refusing to carry out the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters. Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "Those who create this kind of independence often cannot separate it from their personal first-ism. In the relationship between the individual and the Party, they are often incorrect. Although they also say they respect the Party, in reality, they place the individual first and the Party second. What do such people create? They create fame, position, and fame. When they manage a part of the work, they want to create independence." Those who advocate "with me as the center" are essentially like this.

Yan Runhua, a worker from the Foreign Language Printing Plant, said: The proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao represents the fundamental interests of the billion revolutionary people nationwide. All revolutionary masses must closely unite around this leadership center. Following the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, we can defeat any enemy, overcome all difficulties, and advance to victory. Those who advocate the "multi-center theory," however, want to form factions, cause splits, and create bourgeois factionalism, dispersing the unity of our revolutionary ranks based on Mao Zedong Thought. If this develops, it will lead to a very dangerous path.

When there are erroneous thoughts of "with me as the center" in the revolutionary ranks, it is easy for class enemies to take advantage of the situation.

Bao Lianqi, a worker from the Beijing Transformer Factory, said: Those with erroneous thoughts of "with me as the center" judge right and wrong not by Mao Zedong Thought but by whether they support "me" or my small group. This necessarily damages the unity of the revolutionary ranks and weakens combat effectiveness. In such a situation, a small handful of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist-roaders, and untransformed landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists will take the opportunity to stir up trouble or hide in the shadows to spread rumors and create divisions, splitting our revolutionary ranks and sabotaging the Cultural Revolution. In our factory, there was a traitor who, when our two factions were not united, forged history, deceived a part of the masses to protect him, and incited the two factions to attack each other, making it difficult for the great criticism to proceed for a long time and affecting the combination of revolution and production. Later, with the help of the PLA's leftist cadres, we followed Chairman Mao's teaching: "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to necessarily split into two irreconcilable factions." We quickly achieved great unity. Once the masses united, we quickly exposed the enemy.

Liu Guizhi, a worker from Jushan Farm, said: Those who advocate "with me as the center" do not seriously study and carry out the instructions of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao. Instead, they carry out instructions that are beneficial to them and do not carry out those that are not. They even distort and misinterpret to serve themselves and their small groups. They are not loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, or to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line but are loyal to themselves and their small groups. This will definitely harm the overall interests of the proletariat and implement wrong policies. A small handful of desperate class enemies use the "multi-center theory" to sow discord, spread rumors, and attempt to interfere with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments and hinder the implementation of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Therefore, we must raise the thousand-pound hammer of Mao Zedong Thought and thoroughly criticize, expose, and overthrow this reactionary "multi-center theory"!

Severely criticize the reactionary "multi-center theory" and thoroughly eliminate its influence.

Comrades from the Beijing Dyeing Factory, such as Shang Wancai, said: The attitude towards Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters is a fundamental stance and an extremely important issue. Criticizing the "multi-center theory" must firmly grasp this issue. The proletarian headquarters led by the great leader Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin most concentratedly represents the fundamental interests of the proletariat and all revolutionary people. It is the sole leadership center for the entire Party, the entire military, the entire nation, and all revolutionary masses. Every new instruction from Chairman Mao and every battle order from the proletarian headquarters, we must resolutely carry out and thoroughly implement without any discount. This is the minimum awareness of a proletarian revolutionary fighter. Some people, influenced by the thoughts of the "multi-center theory," pay lip service to the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters but secretly follow their own plans, listen to small rumors, and even publicly declare, "We have our own deployments." This attitude is extremely wrong and very dangerous. Such people self-proclaim themselves as leftists, boast about themselves, act cleverly, and do as they please, ultimately leading to their own downfall.

Zhang Xuebin, a comrade from the Beijing Machinery Bureau, said: Chairman Mao teaches us: "All erroneous thoughts, all poisonous weeds, all ghosts and monsters should be criticized, and they must not be allowed to spread freely." The "multi-center theory" is a reactionary bourgeois theory that interferes with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, distorts Chairman Mao's new instructions, and hinders the implementation of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, causing great harm. The practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution shows that in the minds of a few people, the influence of the "multi-center theory" is still quite deep. We must not let it continue to spread. We must seriously carry out criticism, criticize it deeply and thoroughly, and overthrow it. Only in this way can we truly follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, unite our wills, steps, and actions under the command of Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Comrades emphasized: The more the enemy opposes, the more we must support. Class enemies are most afraid of our unity and solidarity based on Mao Zedong Thought and most afraid of Chairman Mao's new instructions becoming the revolutionary actions of billions of people. At this critical moment of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it is especially necessary for us to closely unite around Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters, strengthen the proletarian overall concept, strengthen revolutionary organizational discipline, and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's series of new instructions and all battle orders of the proletarian headquarters. Regarding Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's new instructions, we must follow Vice Chairman Lin's teaching: learn and use them, learn a little and use a little. We cannot separate learning from using, and our words and deeds must be consistent. Our Workers and Peasants Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team not only propagates Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's new instructions but also resolutely carries out Chairman Mao's new instructions and acts according to Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao entrusts us with such an important task, which is the greatest trust and also a good tempering and education for us. We must highhold the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry forward the style of linking theory with practice, and use our model practical actions to propagate Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's new instructions. Together with all revolutionary teachers and students, we will achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

　　永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级司令部
　　彻底批判反动的资产阶级“多中心论”
　　首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队部分同志座谈“八·五”社论纪要
    本报讯　正当全国军民怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱、无限忠诚的深厚的无产阶级感情，热烈庆祝毛主席《炮打司令部》的大字报和毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”发表两周年的时候，首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队的同志们认真学习了《人民日报》八月五日发表的重要社论，大家一致表示：这篇社论传达了以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的声音，一定要坚决照办，彻底执行。到会同志决心更加紧密地团结在毛主席的无产阶级司令部周围，彻底批判反动的“多中心论”，坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级司令部的各项指示，在无产阶级司令部的号令下，统一意志，统一步伐，统一行动，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利而奋斗！
    毛主席的无产阶级司令部是全党、全军、全国和广大革命群众唯一的领导中心
    参加座谈的同志们说：我们从自己的亲身经历中深深懂得以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，是全党、全军、全国和广大革命群众唯一的领导中心。它是在长期的艰苦的革命斗争中形成的。是以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，领导我们推翻了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义三座大山，取得了人民革命的伟大胜利；是以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，带领我们取得社会主义革命和社会主义建设的巨大成就；是以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，指挥我们摧毁了隐藏在我们党内的以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，取得了文化大革命的决定性胜利。几十年革命斗争的历史，在我们工人心中形成了一个信念：只有毛主席的无产阶级司令部才是我们全国革命人民的命根子。有了它的领导，革命就顺利向前发展；离开它的领导，革命就要迷失方向，遭到挫折和失败。我们对以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚。谁妄想破坏这个革命领导中心，我们就同他拚到底！
    巨山农场工人张兰英同志说：天上群星永远朝北斗，地上葵花永远向太阳。俺贫下中农心里永远只有一个中心，就是毛主席的无产阶级司令部。长期斗争的实践告诉我们：坚决服从无产阶级司令部的领导，坚决执行无产阶级司令部的每一项指示，我们就能不断地取得胜利。无产阶级文化大革命以来，我们按照毛主席的指示“我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判。”狠批中国赫鲁晓夫散布的“物质刺激”谬论和修正主义的办场路线，大大提高了大家的阶级斗争觉悟和两条路线斗争的觉悟。同志们说：我们一定听毛主席的话，坚决走社会主义道路。最近，正值水果采摘的大忙季节，我们农场又有一批同志参加了首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队，留农场的同志都纷纷表示：这是毛主席交给我们的光荣任务，一定要坚决完成。留农场的同志每天工作到深夜，使采摘工作质量比往年高，完成任务比往年好，这都是紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，按无产阶级司令部指示办事的结果。
    北京供电局干部陈代钦同志说：在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的领导下，全国无产阶级文化大革命形势一片大好，越来越好。阶级斗争越是深刻、复杂，一小撮穷途末路的阶级敌人越要进行垂死挣扎。所谓“多中心论”，是一种资产阶级山头主义、个人主义的反动理论，它涣散革命队伍在毛泽东思想基础上的团结，妨碍无产阶级革命路线的贯彻执行。谁要坚持搞什么“以我为中心”，就很容易被阶级敌人利用来破坏我们革命队伍的团结，实现他们复辟资本主义的目的，叫我们吃二遍苦，受二遍罪，这是万万办不到的。我们一定要狠狠批判反动的“多中心论”，把它扫进历史的垃圾堆。
    “多中心论”是革命事业前进的绊脚石
    参加座谈的同志们一致指出：反动的“多中心论”，是资产阶级山头主义、个人主义的表现，是修正主义的破烂货。它涣散革命队伍在毛泽东思想基础上的团结，干扰毛主席的伟大战略部署，妨碍毛主席革命路线的贯彻执行。
    有些人搞“以我为中心”，总是个人说了算，唯我独尊，好象真理都在他手里，好象世界上没有他，地球就不转了。他们把自己放在党之上，放在无产阶级司令部之上，说穿了，就是向以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部闹独立性，拒不执行无产阶级司令部的战斗号令。毛主席早就指出：“闹这类独立性的人，常常跟他们的个人第一主义分不开，他们在个人和党的关系问题上，往往是不正确的。他们在口头上虽然也说尊重党，但他们在实际上却把个人放在第一位，把党放在第二位。这种人闹什么东西呢？闹名誉，闹地位，闹出风头。在他们掌管一部分事业的时候，就要闹独立性。”搞“以我为中心”的人，实质上就是这样。
    外文印刷厂工人严润华同志说：以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，代表了全国亿万革命人民的最根本利益，全国广大革命群众必须紧紧地团结在这个领导中心的周围。紧跟毛主席无产阶级司令部，就可以打败任何敌人，克服一切困难，胜利前进。而闹“多中心论”的人却要拉山头，搞分裂，闹资产阶级派性，涣散我们革命队伍在毛泽东思想基础上的团结。发展下去，就要走上极危险的道路。
    当革命队伍中存在“以我为中心”的错误思想时，就容易被阶级敌人钻空子。
    北京变压器厂工人鲍连起同志说：有“以我为中心”错误思想的人，判断是非不是用毛泽东思想去衡量，而是以拥护“我”或我这个小团体为标准。这样就必然破坏革命队伍的团结，削弱战斗力。在这种情况下，一小撮叛徒、特务、死不改悔的走资派和社会上没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子就会乘机兴风作浪，或者躲在阴沟里煽阴风、点鬼火，分裂我们的革命队伍，破坏文化大革命。我们厂里有个叛徒，在我们两派群众没有联合的时候，他伪造历史，蒙蔽一部分群众去保护他，挑动两派群众相互攻击，使革命的大批判较长时间开展不起来，影响了抓革命促生产。后来，在解放军支左人员的帮助下，我们遵照毛主席“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织”的教导，迅速实现了革命的大联合。群众联合起来了，很快就把敌人暴露出来了。
    巨山农场工人刘桂芝同志说：搞“以我为中心”的人，对待以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的指示，不是认真学习，坚决执行，而是对他有利的就执行，对他不利的，就不执行，甚至还断章取义，借以为自己和自己的小团体服务。他们不是忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的革命路线，而是忠于自己和自己的小团体。这样，就一定会损害无产阶级的整体利益，执行错误的政策。一小撮穷途末路的阶级敌人利用“多中心论”，挑拨离间，造谣生事，妄图干扰毛主席的伟大战略部署，妨碍毛主席革命路线的贯彻执行。所以，我们一定要奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，把这种反动的“多中心论”，批深批透，批倒批臭！
    狠狠批判反动的“多中心论”，彻底肃清它的影响
    北京印染厂商万才等同志说：对待毛主席的无产阶级司令部采取什么态度，这是一个根本立场问题，一个极端重要的问题。批判“多中心论”，就要紧紧抓住这个问题。以伟大领袖毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，最集中地代表了无产阶级和广大革命人民的根本利益，是全党、全军、全国和广大革命群众唯一的领导中心。毛主席的每一个最新指示，无产阶级司令部的每一个战斗号令，我们都要坚决照办，彻底执行，决不能打一点折扣，这是一个无产阶级革命战士最起码的觉悟。有些人受了“多中心论”的思想影响，对无产阶级司令部的战斗号令阳奉阴违，专门听那些小道消息，自己另搞一套，甚至公然声称“我们有我们的部署”，这种态度是极端错误的，也是十分危险的。这种人自封左派，自吹自擂，自作聪明，自行其是，结果必然走上自我垮台的道路。
    北京市机械局张学斌同志说：毛主席教导我们：“凡是错误的思想，凡是毒草，凡是牛鬼蛇神，都应该进行批判，决不能让它们自由泛滥。”“多中心论”就是一种反动的资产阶级理论，它干扰毛主席的伟大战略部署，歪曲毛主席的最新指示，妨碍毛主席无产阶级革命路线的贯彻执行，具有很大的危害性。无产阶级文化大革命的实践表明，在少数人的头脑里，“多中心论”的思想影响还是相当深的。我们决不能让它继续泛滥，一定要认真地开展批判，把它批深批透，批倒批臭；只有这样，才能真正做到紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在毛主席的无产阶级司令部的号令下，统一意志，统一步伐，统一行动，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
    同志们强调指出：敌人越是反对，我们越要拥护。阶级敌人最害怕我们在毛泽东思想基础上的团结和统一，最害怕毛主席的最新指示变成亿万群众的革命行动。在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的关键时刻，特别需要我们紧紧地团结在毛主席的无产阶级司令部的周围，加强无产阶级的整体观念，加强革命的组织纪律性，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的一系列最新指示和无产阶级司令部的一切战斗号令。对于毛泽东思想和毛主席的最新指示，我们要遵照林副主席的教导，学了就用，学一点，用一点。不能学用分家，言行不一。我们工农毛泽东思想宣传队，不仅要宣传毛泽东思想和毛主席的最新指示，而且要坚决执行毛主席最新指示，坚决按毛泽东思想办事。毛主席把这样重大的任务交给我们，这是对我们最大的信任，也是对我们很好的锻炼和教育。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬理论联系实际的学风，用自己模范的实际行动宣传毛泽东思想，宣传毛主席的最新指示，同广大革命师生一起，在无产阶级文化大革命中立新功！
