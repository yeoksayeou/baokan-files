Pakistani Foreign Minister Ashad Husain and his wife left Beijing by plane today to visit and tour the southern part of our country.

Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi, along with more than a thousand revolutionary masses from the capital, went to the airport to give them a warm send-off.

Under the fluttering flags of both China and Pakistan, Foreign Minister Husain, accompanied by Vice Premier Chen Yi, walked around the field to bid farewell to the welcoming crowd. The crowd held high portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao, portraits of Pakistani President Ayub Khan, waved the red book of revolutionary quotes "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and shouted slogans: "Firmly support the Pakistani people's struggle to maintain national independence and resist foreign aggression!" "Firmly support the Kashmiri people's struggle for national self-determination!" "Long live the friendship between the peoples of China and Pakistan!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times ten thousand long live Chairman Mao!"

Those who went to the airport to see them off also included leaders from relevant government departments, the People's Liberation Army, the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, representatives of the Five Good Soldiers of the Beijing garrison troops, and leaders of various revolutionary mass organizations in Beijing.

Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Han Nianlong and Pakistani Ambassador to China Sultan M. Khan accompanied Foreign Minister Ashad Husain on his visit to the south.

Diplomatic staff from the Pakistani Embassy in China and envoys from various countries also came to the airport to see them off.
