Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: “In the world, the most feared words are ‘seriousness.’ The Communist Party is the most serious about ‘seriousness.’” In the practice of participating in the county revolutionary committee since then, I have come to realize: the key for a non-full-time committee member to play a role is to always care about the construction of the proletarian revolutionary government and actively participate in it. As long as we follow Chairman Mao’s instructions and do things seriously, we can achieve results.

From the way the masses call me, I have gained an insight. In the past, the masses always called me by my full name. After being elected into the revolutionary committee, sometimes I heard someone calling me “commissioner.” I kept thinking: why is there such a change? In the past, the capitalist roaders enjoyed high positions and salaries, acted arrogantly, and were seriously detached from the masses. We called them “officials.” Now, why do some people not call me by my name as before? I think it must be because I have some official airs and signs of detachment from the masses. I reported this situation to the main responsible comrade of the revolutionary committee, who immediately paid attention to it and repeatedly reminded everyone in the standing committee meeting to be aware of this, and made a decision to achieve revolutionization.

From this incident, I thought: I am one of the dozens of non-full-time committee members. If I regard myself as a “thermometer,” can’t I provide some issues that other committee members should pay attention to? Therefore, I often report the problems I have felt to the county revolutionary committee to promote the revolutionization of the leading cadre.

After participating in the work of the county revolutionary committee, I always worried that if I stayed in one unit, I would not understand the situation of the whole county and would not be able to play a role in guiding the work of the whole county. Practice has made me realize that the whole county is composed of large and small units. If every grassroots unit does well, the work of the whole county will be well done; if grassroots units can create good experiences, they can promote the continuous progress of all units in the county. Therefore, I took my own unit as a base point, relying on the broad masses, and in the effort to do a good job in my own unit, I explored the experience and lessons of guiding the work of the whole county. Our transportation company was originally a relatively backward unit. The poison of “material incentives” spread by the Chinese Khrushchev was deep, and class enemies often used this to incite the masses to oppose the leadership. Someone worried: it would be very difficult to change the face of such a backward unit quickly! At that time, I thought that precisely because it is difficult, we need to create experiences to break through the difficulties. Therefore, I and the comrades of the company revolutionary committee mobilized the masses to start from the class struggle, to severely criticize the “class struggle extinction” theory and “material incentives” and other counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods of the Chinese Khrushchev, and to expose the black hands that incite counter-revolutionary economism. The class enemies were exposed, the masses’ consciousness was raised, and the company’s face changed rapidly. The masses said: we never thought it could change so quickly!

The fact that our company’s face changed boosted my confidence and also made me explore the experience of grasping the root cause to change the face of backward units. I spread these experiences to the various units on the industrial and transportation front that I am in charge of, and I also went to some backward units to assist in the work and solve problems. For example, there was a mine where the two factions had been in conflict for a long time, affecting the revolution and production, and the masses called it an “old difficult problem.” After I went there, I and the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres of this unit started from the class struggle, exposing the class enemies who were hiding behind the scenes and inciting the split. The broad masses united on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, grasped the revolution, and promoted production, and the backward face changed rapidly. The masses reflected that the experience you brought is very effective. I said, as long as we act according to Chairman Mao’s instructions, we can overcome any difficulty and solve any problem. Following Chairman Mao is victory!

    积极参加无产阶级革命政权建设
    江西分宜县革命委员会常委、搬运工人　林春牙
    我们伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“世界上怕就怕‘认真’二字，共产党就最讲‘认真’。”在参加县革委会以来的实践当中，使我认识到：一个不脱产委员要发挥作用，关键在于时刻关心无产阶级革命政权建设，积极参加无产阶级革命政权建设。只要遵照毛主席的指示，认真地去做，就能做出成绩。
    从群众对我的称呼上，我得到了一个启示。过去，群众对我总是呼名喊姓。我被选进革委会后，有时却听到有人称我“委员”。我翻来复去地想：为什么会有这个变化？过去，走资派高官厚禄，盛气凌人，严重脱离群众，我们称他“官老爷”；如今，为什么有人不象以前那样称呼我了呢？我想，一定是自己身上有了官气，有了脱离群众的苗子。我把这个情况反映给革委会主要负责同志，当即受到重视，并且在常委会上一再提醒大家注意，还作出了实现革命化的决定。
    从这件事情上，使我想到：我是几十个不脱产委员中的一个，如果把自己当作一个“温度表”，不是可以给其他委员提供一些值得注意的问题吗！于是，我就经常把自己感受到的问题向县革委会提出，促进领导班子的革命化。
    参加县革委会工作以后，我总担心自己蹲在一个单位，对全县情况不了解，不能在指导全县工作中发挥作用。实践使我认识到，全县是由大大小小的单位组成的，每个基层单位都搞好了，全县工作也就搞好了；基层单位能创造出好的经验，就能推动全县各个单位不断向前迈进。因此，我把自己所在单位作为基点，依靠广大群众，在努力搞好本单位的工作中，来摸索指导全县工作的经验教训。我们搬运公司，原是个比较落后的单位，中国赫鲁晓夫散布的“物质刺激”的流毒较深，阶级敌人经常以此来煽动群众同领导闹对立。有人担心说：这样的后进单位要想很快改变面貌，难上难！当时我想，正因为难，就更需要我们创造突破难点的经验。于是，我和公司革委会的同志一道，充分发动群众，从狠抓阶级斗争入手，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论和“物质刺激”等反革命修正主义黑货，并且把煽动反革命经济主义的黑手揪出来。阶级敌人挖出来了，群众觉悟提高了，公司的面貌迅速改观，群众说：真没想到能变得这么快！
    我们公司面貌变化的事实，增强了我的信心，也使我摸索到狠抓根本，改变后进单位面貌的经验。我把这些经验传播到我所分管的工交战线各单位，还亲自到一些后进单位去协助工作，解决问题。比如有个矿山，两派群众长期闹对立，革命和生产受到影响，群众都称这是个“老大难”。我到那里后，和这个单位的广大革命群众、革命干部一道，从狠抓阶级斗争入手，把暗藏在幕后挑动分裂的阶级敌人揪了出来。广大群众在毛泽东思想原则基础上团结了起来，狠抓革命，猛促生产，后进面貌迅速改观。群众反映说，你们带来的经验很起作用。我说，只要按毛主席的指示办事，什么困难都能克服，什么问题都能解决。紧跟毛主席就是胜利！
