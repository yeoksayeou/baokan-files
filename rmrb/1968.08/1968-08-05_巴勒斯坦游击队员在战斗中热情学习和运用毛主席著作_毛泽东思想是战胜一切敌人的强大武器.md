Palestinian guerrillas are enthusiastically studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in their battles. Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful weapon to defeat all enemies.

		BEIRUT, Aug. 3 (Xinhua) -- A Palestinian guerrilla who had fought against Israeli aggressors on the West Bank of the Jordan River recently told a Xinhua correspondent here: "Chairman Mao's teaching that 'political power grows out of the barrel of a gun' has greatly inspired us. The Palestinian people must take up armed struggle to resist the aggression of U.S. imperialism's tool, Israel, and to liberate our homeland. Those so-called political solutions are all deceptive."

		He went on to say: "The enemy we are facing is actually U.S.-led world imperialism, and Israel is merely a running dog of U.S. imperialism. They may seem powerful now, but as Chairman Mao teaches us: 'All reactionaries are paper tigers. In appearance, the reactionaries are terrifying, but in reality, they have no real power. From a long-term perspective, the truly powerful force does not belong to the reactionaries but to the people.' We will persist in our struggle, and victory will surely be ours."

		He further stated: "The Israeli aggressors, armed with modern weapons and equipment provided by U.S. imperialism, are brutally suppressing us in the occupied areas. However, the revolutionary-conscious Palestinian commando units often launch attacks on them and achieve continuous victories. As Chairman Mao says: 'Weapons are an important factor in war, but they are not the decisive factor; it is people, not things, that are decisive.'"

		A "Storm" commando from the West Bank told a Xinhua correspondent that he and many of his comrades have studied Chairman Mao's military works, especially his strategies and tactics of people's war, and applied them in their guerrilla warfare against Israeli aggressors. He said that although the "Storm" commando is currently at a disadvantage, they often launch surprise attacks on the Israeli occupying forces, which are temporarily superior in military strength, and achieve victories. He recounted that one night, he and some comrades attacked an Israeli military position, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. When Israeli reinforcements hurriedly arrived, the commandos had already swiftly and safely withdrawn.

		He said: "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Revolutionary war is the people's war. Only by mobilizing the people can we wage war, and only by relying on the people can we wage war.' Chairman Mao's teachings have shown us the way. We have mobilized the Palestinian people in the occupied areas and rely on them. They actively support us in resisting the Israeli aggressors because they understand that this is a struggle to liberate their own homeland."

		Another "Storm" commando told a Xinhua correspondent that they highly praise the glorious traditions of the Chinese People's Liberation Army created and led by Chairman Mao, especially the close relationship between the PLA and the people. He expressed their desire to learn from the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

　　巴勒斯坦游击队员在战斗中热情学习和运用毛主席著作
　　毛泽东思想是战胜一切敌人的强大武器
    新华社大马士革三日电　曾经在约旦河西岸抗击过以色列侵略者的一位巴勒斯坦游击队员最近在这里向新华社记者发表谈话说：“毛主席指出的‘枪杆子里面出政权’这一真理，给了我们很大的鼓舞。我们巴勒斯坦人民，要抗击美帝国主义的工具以色列的占领，解放我们的家园，只能走武装斗争的道路。那些所谓政治解决方案，都不过是骗人的东西。”
    他接着说：“我们所面对的敌人，实际上就是以美国为首的世界帝国主义，而以色列只不过是美帝国主义的走狗。表面上，它们现在是强大的。但是，正如毛主席教导我们的：‘一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。’我们将坚持斗争，胜利一定是我们的。”
    他还说：“用美帝国主义提供的现代化武器和装备武装起来的以色列侵略者，在占领区对我们实行残酷的镇压。但是，具有革命觉悟的巴勒斯坦突击队，经常向他们发动进攻，并不断取得胜利。正如毛主席说的：‘武器是战争的重要的因素，但不是决定的因素，决定的因素是人不是物。’”
    来自约旦河西岸的一个“暴风”突击队员对新华社记者说，他和其他许多战友学习了毛主席的军事著作，特别是关于人民战争的战略战术，并把毛主席的著作运用于抗击以色列侵略者的游击战争中。他说，“暴风”突击队目前虽然处于劣势，但是他们经常对目前在军事力量方面暂时处于优势的以色列占领军发动奇袭，不断取得胜利。他说，有一天夜晚，他和一些战友袭击了以色列的一处军事阵地，使敌人遭受重大损失，当以色列援军匆忙地赶到那里时，突击队已经迅速安全地撤走了。
    他说：“毛主席教导我们：‘革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。’毛主席的教导为我们巴勒斯坦游击队指明了方向。我们动员了占领区的巴勒斯坦人民群众，并依靠他们。他们积极支持我们抗击以色列侵略者，因为他们懂得这是为了解放他们自己的家园而战斗。”
    另一个“暴风”突击队员对新华社记者说，他们非常赞扬毛主席缔造和领导的中国人民解放军的光荣传统，特别是人民解放军同人民的鱼水般的亲密关系。他表示，他们要向中国人民解放军学习。
