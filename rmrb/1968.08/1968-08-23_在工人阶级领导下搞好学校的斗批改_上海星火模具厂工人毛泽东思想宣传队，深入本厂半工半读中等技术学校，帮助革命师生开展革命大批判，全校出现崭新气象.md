The Shanghai Xinghuo Mould Factory's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, led by workers, has entered the factory's half-work, half-study secondary technical school. They have assisted revolutionary teachers and students in carrying out revolutionary criticism, and the entire school has taken on a new look.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Shanghai on the 21st, the Shanghai Xinghuo Mould Factory Revolutionary Committee has seriously implemented the leadership role of the working class in the educational revolution. They organized the workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team to enter the factory's half-work, half-study secondary technical school. They armed the revolutionary teachers and students with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, causing the school to undergo profound changes and presenting a thriving revolutionary atmosphere. After Chairman Mao issued the latest directive that "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully exert the leadership role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in all work," the revolutionary workers and teachers and students of the entire factory are even more elated. They have decided to follow Chairman Mao's brilliant teachings on the educational revolution, to further reform the factory-run school, and to make it a stronghold for cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

The half-work, half-study school of the Xinghuo Mould Factory was established in 1965, enrolling 80 students. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary youngsters of this school raised the banner of "It is right to rebel against reactionaries" and bravely launched a fierce attack on the capitalist reactionary line promoted by China's Khrushchev and his agents. They played a certain pioneering role as Red Guards. However, later, some students were influenced by the anarchist ideology stirred up by a handful of class enemies, making it difficult for the school to resume classes and carry out the revolution. In response to this situation, the members of the factory's Revolutionary Committee studied Chairman Mao's series of instructions on the educational revolution and learned from Chairman Mao's teaching that "ideological and political work must be the responsibility of every department." They recognized that the working class is the leading class of the state and should fully exert its leadership role in all work. The proletarian educational revolution is an important front for the working class to exert its leadership. The working class must manage education, propagate Mao Zedong Thought to the students, carry out ideological and political work among the students, lead the students to carry out the educational revolution, and make the factory-run school cultivate socialist-conscious and cultured laborers for the state.

After the members of the factory's Revolutionary Committee reached a consensus, they immediately took measures to manage the school work. On one hand, they propagated Chairman Mao's thoughts on the educational revolution among all revolutionary workers in the factory, frequently introduced the students' situation to the workers, and required all workers in the factory to care about the educational revolution of the school. At the same time, they organized a Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team composed of revolutionary mass organization cadres and old workers to enter the school to propagate Mao Zedong Thought and assist the school in resuming classes and carrying out the revolution. After the workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team entered the school, they first helped the Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought actively. In half a year, the school had consecutively held 15 Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Revolutionary teachers and students used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon in the study classes to criticize the anarchist ideology, strengthen proletarian organizational discipline; at the same time, they carried out revolutionary criticism in the study classes, severely criticized China's Khrushchev's revisionist educational line, and firmly established Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line. Through actively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, the entire school achieved revolutionary great unity and established the school's Revolutionary Committee. The workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team also assisted the revolutionary teachers and students in carrying out struggles against the enemy and cleaning up the class ranks, exposing the class enemies hidden among the teaching staff. To fully mobilize the students and carry out the revolution of resuming classes, many old workers participating in the workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, with deep proletarian feelings, carried out in-depth and detailed ideological and political work among the students. Some old workers visited the students' homes, had individual talks with the students, and together with the students' parents, carried out reminiscence and comparison, conducted class education for the students, and raised the students' proletarian consciousness.

Under the assistance of the workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, the factory's half-work, half-study secondary technical school presented a new revolutionary atmosphere. Revolutionary teachers and students, in the deep criticism of China's Khrushchev's revisionist educational line, consciously linked their thoughts, deeply touched their souls, transformed their worldviews, and became even more determined to take the road of integrating with the workers and peasants. Most students, when participating in workshop labor, did not pick and choose, and everywhere humbly learned from the working class's boundless love for Chairman Mao's excellent qualities, taking a big step forward on the road of thought revolutionization.

    在工人阶级领导下搞好学校的斗批改
    上海星火模具厂工人毛泽东思想宣传队，深入本厂半工半读中等技术学校，帮助革命师生开展革命大批判，全校出现崭新气象
    据新华社上海二十一日电　上海星火模具厂革命委员会认真发挥工人阶级在教育革命中的领导作用，组织工人毛泽东思想宣传队到本厂半工半读中等技术学校，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装革命师生，使这个学校的面貌发生了深刻的变化，出现了一片欣欣向荣的崭新革命气象。最近毛主席发出“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用”的最新指示后，全厂革命职工和革命师生更加欢欣鼓舞。他们决心遵循毛主席有关教育革命的光辉教导，进一步对工厂办的学校进行深刻的改革，使它成为培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的坚强阵地。
    星火模具厂的这所半工半读学校是在一九六五年开办的，招收学生八十人。在无产阶级文化大革命中，这个学校的革命小将高举“对反动派造反有理”的旗帜，勇敢地起来向中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人疯狂推行的资产阶级反动路线发动猛烈进攻，发挥了红卫兵小将的某种先导作用。但后来有些学生受了一小撮阶级敌人所煽起的反动的无政府主义思潮的影响，使学校不能更好地复课闹革命。针对这种情况，这个厂的革委会成员，学习了毛主席关于教育革命的一系列指示，学习了毛主席“思想政治工作，各个部门都要负责任”的教导，认识到工人阶级是国家的领导阶级，应当在一切工作中充分发挥领导作用，无产阶级教育革命是工人阶级发挥领导作用的一条重要战线。工人阶级就是要管教育，要向学生宣传毛泽东思想，对学生进行思想政治工作，领导学生搞好教育革命，使工厂办的学校，为国家培养有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。
    厂革委会成员统一认识后立即采取措施，把学校工作抓起来。他们一方面在全厂革命职工中宣传毛主席的教育革命思想，经常向职工介绍学生的情况，要求全厂职工都来关心学校的教育革命。同时，组织了一支有革命群众组织骨干和老工人参加的毛泽东思想宣传队，到学校宣传毛泽东思想，协助学校复课闹革命。工人毛泽东思想宣传队到学校后，首先帮助学校的红卫兵小将和革命师生，活学活用毛泽东思想，大办毛泽东思想学习班。在半年的时间里，这个学校已连续举办了十五期毛泽东思想学习班。革命师生在学习班里，以毛泽东思想为武器，批判了无政府主义思潮，加强了无产阶级的组织纪律性；同时在学习班里开展革命大批判，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义教育路线，大立毛主席的无产阶级教育路线。通过活学活用毛泽东思想，全校实现了革命的大联合，建立了校革命委员会。工人毛泽东思想宣传队还帮助革命师生开展对敌斗争和清理阶级队伍的工作，揪出了隐藏在教师队伍中的阶级敌人。为了把学生充分发动起来，搞好复课闹革命，许多参加工人毛泽东思想宣传队的老工人怀着深厚的无产阶级感情，对学生进行了深入细致的思想政治工作。有些老工人挨家挨户进行家庭访问，和学生个别谈心，并且同学生家长一起开展回忆对比，对学生进行阶级教育，提高了学生的无产阶级觉悟。
    在工人毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，这个厂的半工半读中等技术学校出现了一派新的革命气象。革命师生在深入开展对中国赫鲁晓夫推行的修正主义教育路线的大批判中，自觉地联系自己的思想，狠触灵魂，改造世界观，更加坚定了走与工农相结合的道路。大部分学生在参加车间劳动时不挑肥拣瘦，并且处处虚心向工人阶级无限热爱毛主席的优秀品质学习，在思想革命化的道路上迈进了一大步。
