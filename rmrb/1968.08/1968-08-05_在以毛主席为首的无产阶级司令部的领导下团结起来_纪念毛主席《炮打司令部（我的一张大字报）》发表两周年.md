In the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, we must unite.

	Two years ago today, our great leader Chairman Mao wrote a brilliant and epoch-making big-character poster, “Bombard the Headquarters,” at the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party.

	In the big-character poster, Chairman Mao sharply pointed out that the counterrevolutionary bourgeois headquarters headed by the Chinese Khrushchev “stands on the reactionary bourgeois position, exercises bourgeois dictatorship, suppresses the surging cultural revolution of the proletariat, confuses right and wrong, persecutes revolutionaries, suppresses dissenting opinions, and imposes white terror. They are proud of their bourgeois arrogance and trample on the spirit of the proletariat. How vicious it is! Linking this to the rightist deviation in 1962 and the pseudo-leftist but actually rightist deviation in 1964, is it not a profound lesson?”

	Chairman Mao’s big-character poster “Bombard the Headquarters” was like a thunderclap, deeply exposing the essence of the bourgeois reactionary line and, with irresistible force, shattering the bourgeois headquarters headed by the Chinese Khrushchev that had long been hidden within our Party.

	After the publication of Chairman Mao’s big-character poster “Bombard the Headquarters,” the proletarian revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses, under the command of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, launched an unprecedentedly broad and deep struggle to expose, fight against, and criticize the bourgeois headquarters headed by the Chinese Khrushchev. Through repeated struggles, they thoroughly exposed the counterrevolutionary nature of the Chinese Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party who represented the interests of the American imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and the Kuomintang reactionaries. They smashed this bourgeois headquarters that attempted to restore capitalism, dragged out their agents in various places, captured one reactionary stronghold after another, and generally established revolutionary committees of the three-in-one combination, seizing back the power in the Party, government, economy, and culture that had been usurped by them.

	The most serious lesson in the history of the dictatorship of the proletariat is that the bourgeoisie subverts the dictatorship of the proletariat and restores capitalism often through the conspiratorial activities of the bourgeois headquarters hidden within the proletarian party. Chairman Mao’s big-character poster and a series of wise decisions initiated an unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution, relying on the immense power of hundreds of millions of revolutionary people, sentenced the bourgeois headquarters hidden within our Party to death, and solved the fundamental problem of how to prevent the restoration of capitalism under the dictatorship of the proletariat. This is Chairman Mao’s great contribution to the development of Marxism-Leninism and to the international communist movement.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: “The core force leading our cause is the Communist Party of China.” “The theoretical foundation guiding our thinking is Marxism-Leninism.” In the great storm of the proletarian cultural revolution, the proletarian revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses personally participated in the class struggle between the proletarian headquarters and the bourgeois headquarters, between the proletarian revolutionary line and the bourgeois reactionary line, greatly enhancing their awareness of the struggle between the two lines. They have a deeper understanding than ever before of the essence of the struggle between the two lines: the proletarian headquarters headed by the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin most concentratedly represents the fundamental interests of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses. In any situation, it insists on the dictatorship of the proletariat, insists on the socialist road, protects the broad masses of the people, and fights to the end against imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries, and fights to the end against the bourgeois restoration plot. The bourgeois headquarters headed by the Chinese Khrushchev represents the interests of the Kuomintang reactionaries, that is, the bourgeoisie and the landlords, rich peasants, counterrevolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, plotting to restore capitalism, suppressing the broad revolutionary masses, and attempting to make the broad masses of people once again become the slaves of imperialism, the bourgeoisie, and the landlord class. After this great revolutionary storm, the proletarian revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses have an extreme hatred for the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, love the proletarian headquarters more, are more loyal to the proletarian headquarters, and more firmly follow every strategic deployment of the proletarian headquarters.

	The proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin is the sole leadership center for the entire Party, the entire army, the entire country, and the broad revolutionary masses. The entire Party, the entire army, and the entire country can only have such a center and cannot have a second center. We must unite hundreds of millions of revolutionary people around this leadership center. The so-called “multi-center theory” is a reactionary theory of bourgeois factionalism and individualism, which disperses the unity of the revolutionary ranks on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, hinders the implementation of the proletarian revolutionary line. If each department and each unit insists on being the “center,” and there are many “centers” in the country, it is still without a center. If such thinking is allowed to develop without correction, it will lead to the erroneous path of deviating from and even opposing the proletarian headquarters. We must criticize the erroneous idea of “being the center,” strengthen the proletarian sense of unity, strengthen revolutionary organizational discipline, resolutely implement the various instructions of the proletarian headquarters, and promptly expose the conspiracies of the class enemy to spread rumors and sow discord, and smash the desperate struggles of the handful of enemies of the proletariat.

	At the moment of achieving a comprehensive victory in the proletarian cultural revolution, it is especially necessary for us to be infinitely loyal to the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. For every new instruction from Chairman Mao, we must carry it out resolutely and thoroughly. We must execute what we understand and also execute what we do not understand temporarily, deepening our understanding in the process of execution. The proletarian revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses must unify their will, steps, and actions under the command of the proletarian headquarters.

	To truly follow Chairman Mao’s great strategic deployment and advance victoriously under the leadership of Chairman Mao’s proletarian headquarters, the most fundamental thing is to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought actively, especially to study and apply Chairman Mao’s series of extremely important new instructions on the proletarian cultural revolution. First, we must study, and second, we must apply. We must apply what we have studied; studying is for the sake of applying. There are a few people who do not seriously study Mao Zedong Thought, do not seriously implement Chairman Mao’s new instructions, have swollen heads, deviate from Chairman Mao’s great strategic deployment, and even distort the highest instructions. Such people, if they do not resolutely change their bourgeois worldview with Mao Zedong Thought, will fall into a dangerous pit.

	The proletarian cultural revolution is facing a great situation. Our socialist motherland is thriving. Our proletarian dictatorship is more solid than ever. On the occasion of commemorating the second anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao’s big-character poster “Bombard the Headquarters,” all levels of revolutionary committees, the proletarian revolutionary masses, and the broad revolutionary masses must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, unite under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, strengthen the struggle against the enemy, carry out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism, and thoroughly clean up the class ranks. We must eliminate the pernicious influence of the Chinese Khrushchev’s counterrevolutionary revisionist line, complete the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation on all fronts, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the proletarian cultural revolution!

　　在以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的领导下团结起来
　　——纪念毛主席《炮打司令部（我的一张大字报）》发表两周年
    两年前的今天，我们的伟大领袖毛主席在党的八届十一中全会上，写下了光辉的具有划时代意义的大字报《炮打司令部》。
    毛主席在大字报中尖锐地指出，以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的反革命的资产阶级司令部“站在反动的资产阶级立场上，实行资产阶级专政，将无产阶级轰轰烈烈的文化大革命运动打下去，颠倒是非，混淆黑白，围剿革命派，压制不同意见，实行白色恐怖，自以为得意，长资产阶级的威风，灭无产阶级的志气，又何其毒也！联系到一九六二年的右倾和一九六四年形‘左’而实右的错误倾向，岂不是可以发人深醒的吗？”
    毛主席的大字报一声炮响，深刻地揭露了资产阶级反动路线的实质，以雷霆万钧之力，粉碎了长期隐藏在我们党内的以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部。
    毛主席《炮打司令部》的大字报发表以后，无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的统帅下，在空前未有的广度和深度上，波澜壮阔地发动了对以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部的大揭露、大斗争、大批判。经过多次反复的较量，彻底揭穿了中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派代表美帝、苏修、国民党反动派利益的反革命面目，胜利地摧毁了这个妄图复辟资本主义的资产阶级司令部，揪出了他们在各地的代理人，攻下了他们盘踞的一个又一个反动堡垒，普遍地成立了革命三结合的革命委员会，把被他们篡夺了的那部分党、政、财、文大权夺了回来。
    无产阶级专政历史上的一个极其严重的教训，就是资产阶级颠覆无产阶级专政，复辟资本主义，往往是要通过隐藏在无产阶级政党内部的资产阶级司令部的阴谋活动来实现。毛主席的大字报和一系列英明决策，发动了史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，依靠了亿万革命人民的巨大威力，宣判了隐藏在我们党内的资产阶级司令部的死刑，解决了在无产阶级专政条件下，如何防止资本主义复辟的最根本的问题。这是毛主席对马克思列宁主义的伟大发展，对国际共产主义运动的杰出贡献。
    毛主席教导我们：“领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党。”“指导我们思想的理论基础是马克思列宁主义。”在无产阶级文化大革命的伟大风暴中，无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众亲身参加了无产阶级司令部同资产阶级司令部、无产阶级革命路线同资产阶级反动路线的阶级斗争实践，极大地提高了两条路线斗争的觉悟。他们比以往任何时候都更加深刻地认识到两条路线斗争的实质：以伟大领袖毛主席为首和他的亲密战友林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，最集中地代表了无产阶级和广大革命人民群众的根本利益，它在任何情况下，都坚持无产阶级专政，坚持社会主义道路，保护广大人民群众，同帝国主义、现代修正主义、各国反动派斗争到底，同资产阶级的复辟阴谋斗争到底；以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，代表国民党反动派即资产阶级和地、富、反、坏、右的利益，阴谋复辟资本主义，镇压广大革命人民群众，妄图使广大人民重新沦为帝国主义、资产阶级、地主阶级的牛马。经过了这场大革命的风暴，无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众极其仇恨党内最大的一小撮走资派，更加热爱无产阶级司令部，更加忠于无产阶级司令部，更加坚定不移地紧跟无产阶级司令部的每一个战略部署。
    以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，是全党、全军、全国和广大革命群众唯一的领导中心。全党、全军、全国只能有这样一个中心，不能有第二个中心。我们要把亿万革命人民，都紧紧团结在这个领导中心的周围。所谓“多中心论”是一种资产阶级山头主义、个人主义的反动理论，它涣散革命队伍在毛泽东思想基础上的团结，妨碍无产阶级革命路线的贯彻执行。倘若各个部门、各个单位都要“以我为中心”，全国有许多个“中心”，仍旧是无中心。这种思想如果听任发展下去而不加纠正，就会走到脱离以至对抗无产阶级司令部的错误的道路上去。我们必须批判“以我为中心”的错误思想，加强无产阶级的整体观念，加强革命的组织纪律性，坚决贯彻执行无产阶级司令部的各项指示，及时识破阶级敌人造谣诬蔑、挑拨离间的阴谋，粉碎穷途末路的一小撮无产阶级的敌人的垂死挣扎。
    在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的时刻，特别需要我们对以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的无限忠诚。对毛主席的每一个最新指示，都要坚决照办，彻底执行。理解的要执行，暂时不理解的也要执行，在执行过程中加深理解。无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，要在无产阶级司令部的号令下统一意志，统一步伐，统一行动。
    要真正做到紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在毛主席的无产阶级司令部的领导下胜利前进，最根本的一条，就是要活学活用毛泽东思想，特别是要学好用好毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的一系列极其重要的最新指示。第一是要学，第二是要用。学了要用，学是为了用。有极少数“以我为中心”的人不认真学习毛泽东思想，不认真执行毛主席最新指示，头脑膨胀，离开毛主席的伟大战略部署，甚至歪曲最高指示。这种人如果不痛下决心，用毛泽东思想改造自己的资产阶级世界观，就会滑到危险的泥坑里去。
    无产阶级文化大革命面临着一片大好形势。我们的社会主义祖国欣欣向荣。我们的无产阶级专政空前巩固。在纪念毛主席《炮打司令部》大字报发表两周年的时候，各级革命委员会，无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，要高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的领导下团结起来，加强无产阶级专政，加强对敌斗争，深入持久地开展革命的大批判，切实做好清理阶级队伍的工作，把中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义路线的恶劣影响清除干净，完成各条战线上的斗、批、改任务，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
