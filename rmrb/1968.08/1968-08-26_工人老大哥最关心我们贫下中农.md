To the Editor,

In this year's "three summer" period, the worker big brothers from Beijing's Second Rolling Mill heard on the radio that there would be hail the next day, so they actively came to support us, allowing our brigade's wheat to be quickly harvested and stored. Support in thousands of ways, but the greatest support the worker big brothers brought us is Mao Zedong Thought. The worker big brothers helped us establish a system for studying Chairman Mao's works, introduced us to good experiences in applying Mao Zedong Thought, and presented us with precious books and portraits of Chairman Mao. They also brought the factory's capitalists to the fields, and we brought along those landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements who had not been reformed, to jointly carry out revolutionary criticism and denunciation. Together with the worker big brothers, we poor and lower-middle peasants raised our fists to fiercely criticize China's Khrushchev's heinous crimes of sabotaging the worker-peasant alliance and jointly eliminated the poison of revisionism.

Every Sunday, a stranger would come to our brigade, work with the community members, and have heart-to-heart talks, helping us study Chairman Mao's works. As soon as the radiant portrait of "Chairman Mao Goes to Anyuan" was published, this stranger brought us a hundred portraits. Every time Chairman Mao's latest instructions were issued, he would promptly come to propagate them. This comrade is from the Second Rolling Mill.

The worker big brothers' exemplary actions of being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and infinitely loving Mao Zedong Thought deeply educated all of us poor and lower-middle peasants. Under the influence of the worker big brothers, our brigade's mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought is carried out thoroughly, the revolutionary criticism and denunciation is fiery, and labor production is booming.

In the days of joint struggle, we poor and lower-middle peasants and the worker big brothers forged deep class sentiments. Under the radiant guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, our hearts are even closer, and a new relationship of worker-peasant alliance has emerged.

When we recall the past, we poor and lower-middle peasants have endless hatred for China's Khrushchev and a handful of unrepentant capitalists. They, in order to achieve the restoration of capitalism, used every means to sabotage the worker-peasant alliance. We poor and lower-middle peasants will not be fooled by the class enemies. We deeply understand that without the worker-peasant alliance led by the working class, there would be no liberation for the working people, and there would be no socialist today. Our great leader Chairman Mao recently instructed: "The leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and all work must be fully brought into play." We must humbly learn from the working class, strengthen the worker-peasant alliance, which cannot be washed away by floods or blown apart by storms.

All the poor and lower-middle peasants of the Ma Jiadu Brigade, Nanyuan People's Commune, Fengtai District, Beijing

### 工人老大哥最关心我们贫下中农

专栏：革命群众来信

    工人老大哥最关心我们贫下中农编辑同志：
    在今年“三夏”中，北京第二轧钢厂的工人老大哥，从广播中收听到第二天有冰雹的消息，就主动来支援我们，使我队小麦很快抢收到场。千支援万支援，工人老大哥给我们带来了毛泽东思想，是最大的支援。工人老大哥帮助我们建立了学习毛主席著作的制度，给我们介绍活学活用毛泽东思想的好经验，向我们贫下中农赠送宝书和毛主席画像。他们还把厂里走资派带到田间地头，我们也把没有改造好的地、富、反、坏分子拉上来，一起开展革命大批判。我们贫下中农和工人老大哥一起举起铁拳，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫破坏工农联盟的滔天罪行，共同肃清修正主义流毒。
    每当星期天，我们队里就来一个陌生人，和社员们一边劳动一边谈心，帮助我们学习毛主席著作。《毛主席去安源》的光辉画像刚刚出版，这个陌生人就把一百张画像送到了我们中间。每次毛主席最新指示一发表，他都及时来进行宣传。这个同志就是轧钢二厂的。
    工人老大哥无限忠于毛主席，无限热爱毛泽东思想的模范行动，深深教育了我们全体贫下中农。在工人老大哥的带动下，我们队活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动开展得扎扎实实，革命大批判热火朝天，劳动生产热气腾腾。
    在共同战斗的日子里，我们贫下中农和工人老大哥结下了深厚的阶级感情。在毛主席最新指示的光辉照耀下，我们的心贴得更紧了，出现了工农联盟的崭新关系。
    提起过去的事，我们贫下中农对中国赫鲁晓夫和一小撮死不改悔的走资派有说不完的恨。他们为了达到复辟资本主义的目的，千方百计地破坏工农联盟。我们贫下中农决不上阶级敌人的当。我们深深懂得没有以工人阶级为领导的工农联盟，就没有劳动人民的解放，就没有社会主义的今天。伟大领袖毛主席最近指示：“要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。”我们一定要虚心向工人阶级学习，加强工农联盟，洪水冲不垮，狂风吹不散。
