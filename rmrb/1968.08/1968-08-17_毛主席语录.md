	People's democratic dictatorship requires the leadership of the working class. This is because only the working class has the greatest foresight, is selfless, and is most thorough in its revolutionary spirit. The entire history of the revolution proves that without the leadership of the working class, the revolution will fail. With the leadership of the working class, the revolution will be victorious.
