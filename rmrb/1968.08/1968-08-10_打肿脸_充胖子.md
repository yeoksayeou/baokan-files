Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi recently boasted in the Indian parliament about the "aid" and loans India has provided to Southeast Asian countries and regions, as if she were reciting a list of family treasures. Such self-praise is nothing but laughable.

Is it to show off wealth? This is rather inappropriate. Everyone knows that the Indian reactionaries are willing to sell national interests to exchange for "aid" from U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, completely relying on begging and borrowing to get by. They are in debt up to their necks, constantly borrowing new loans to repay old ones. Just the interest on foreign debts alone amounts to four or five billion rupees per year. Despite being parasites who cannot survive a day without the "aid" from U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, they proudly jingle the few copper coins they have begged and borrowed, isn't this ridiculous?

Is it to show kindness? This is purely deceitful. The Indian ruling class, representing the interests of Indian landlords and big capitalists, has always harbored expansionist ambitions and pursued expansionist policies. They take a small portion from the rewards given by their masters and provide so-called "aid" and loans to Southeast Asian countries and regions. Apart from trying to maintain the facade of a wealthy household despite being impoverished, their purpose is to use these means to infiltrate economically and make a bit of profit, far from being "charitable."

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out that in economically backward semi-colonial countries, "the landlord class and comprador class are completely appendages of the international bourgeoisie, their survival and development being dependent on imperialism." The Indian landlords and big capitalists are exactly like this. They were once completely dependent on British imperialism; after India declared independence, they gradually leaned towards U.S. imperialism, becoming a lackey of imperialism led by the United States. What is called "Indian aid" is actually a derivative of "U.S. aid." The Indian ruling class merely plays the role of a secondary creditor to meet the needs of U.S. imperialism.

Indira Gandhi's boasting about so-called "Indian aid" cannot elevate the supposed "great power" status of the Indian reactionary ruling class, nor can it solve their serious political crisis. This act of inflating one's face to appear wealthy only shows how desperate and pathetic the Indian reactionaries are.

　　打肿脸  充胖子
    印度总理英迪拉·甘地最近在印度议会中，如数家珍地大肆吹嘘印度对东南亚国家和地区提供的“援助”和贷款。这种自吹自擂，只能使人嗤之以鼻。
    是摆阔气吗？这未免太不合身份。谁都知道，印度反动派不惜出卖民族利益去换取美帝、苏修的“援助”，完全靠乞讨和借债度日。他们欠了一屁股的债，要不断借新债来偿还旧债，每年单是支付外债的利息就达四五十亿卢比。自己明明是离开美帝、苏修的“援助”就一天也活不下去的寄生虫，居然洋洋得意地拨弄着口袋里乞来和借来的几个铜板当当作响，岂不可笑？
    是装善心吗？这更是纯粹的欺骗。代表印度大地主、大资产阶级利益的印度统治集团一贯怀抱着扩张主义野心，奉行扩张主义政策。他们从主子给予的赏赐中掏出个零头，向东南亚的国家和地区提供所谓“援助”和贷款，除了象破落户还要装阔户门面之外，其目的就在于通过这些手段进行经济渗透，从中捞取一点油水，哪里是什么“乐善好施”呢？
    我们伟大领袖毛主席指出，在经济落后的半殖民地国家，“地主阶级和买办阶级完全是国际资产阶级的附庸，其生存和发展，是附属于帝国主义的”。印度大地主、大资产阶级也正是这样。他们过去完全依附于英帝国主义；印度宣布独立后，又一步步地投靠美帝国主义，成为以美国为首的帝国主义的附庸。所谓“印援”，实际上只是“美援”的派生物，印度统治集团不过是适应美帝国主义的需要，扮演着一种二路债主的角色而已。
    英迪拉·甘地大肆吹嘘所谓“印援”，既不能抬高印度反动统治集团的所谓“大国”地位，更不能解决他们的严重政治危机。这种打肿脸充胖子的做法，只说明印度反动派是多么的穷极无聊。
