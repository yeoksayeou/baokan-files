The great proletarian cultural revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, is advancing from victory to victory. At this moment, the Yunnan Provincial Revolutionary Committee, located at the southwestern border and frontline of national defense of our motherland, has been born triumphantly under the tremendous inspiration of Chairman Mao's latest instructions!

The establishment of the Yunnan Provincial Revolutionary Committee announces the complete failure of Khrushchev and the clique of capitalist roaders within the Party, represented by Yan Hongyan and Zhao Jianmin in Yunnan, in their attempt to restore capitalism in Yunnan. It strikes a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, reactionaries of all countries, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and encourages the revolutionary people of the whole country who are advancing in victory.

With heartfelt proletarian feelings, we extend our highest revolutionary salute to the 23 million people of various nationalities in Yunnan and the broad cadres and fighters of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Yunnan, who have undergone profound tempering in the fierce class struggle!

The proletarian headquarters, with Chairman Mao as the commander-in-chief and Vice Chairman Lin as the deputy, has shown great concern for the cultural revolution in Yunnan. Chairman Mao has given extremely wise instructions on the cultural revolution in Yunnan on many occasions, pointing out the direction for the revolutionary people of Yunnan to advance to victory. The establishment of the Yunnan Provincial Revolutionary Committee is another great victory of Mao Zedong Thought! It is another great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

In Yunnan, as in other regions, the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the socialist road and the capitalist road, Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of Khrushchev in China, have undergone a long period of heart-rending struggles. In the unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution, a handful of spies, traitors, and unrepentant capitalist roaders, representing the interests of the Kuomintang reactionaries, that is, imperialism, the bourgeoisie, and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, have launched one savage counterattack after another against Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The revolutionary masses of the proletariat in Yunnan, who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, have followed Chairman Mao closely, held high the revolutionary banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against the reactionaries," and with great revolutionary heroism, have fought tenaciously against all kinds of class enemies, smashing the enemy's sabotage from the right and the ultra-"left," and finally seizing the decisive victory of the cultural revolution.

The broad cadres and fighters of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Yunnan have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly stood on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, resolutely supported the broad leftist masses, and performed new feats in the glorious tasks of defending national defense and "three supports, two militaries." They are indeed the loyal defenders of proletarian dictatorship and the cultural revolution.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "Our people's democratic dictatorship is a powerful weapon to safeguard the fruits of the people's revolution and to oppose the restoration plots of internal and external enemies. We must firmly grasp this weapon."

We hope that after the establishment of the Yunnan Provincial Revolutionary Committee, it will rely on the revolutionary masses, strengthen the proletarian dictatorship, and take the initiative to launch attacks on the class enemies. To strengthen the struggle against the enemy, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses in Yunnan must further unite closely on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, unify their thinking, steps, and actions with Mao Zedong Thought, criticize the reactionary bourgeois "multi-center theory," practice democratic centralism, and constantly enhance the revolutionary unity of the leadership core of the revolutionary committee, the revolutionary unity of the military and the people, the revolutionary unity among revolutionary mass organizations, and the revolutionary unity among the nationalities. We must follow Chairman Mao's instruction that "all phenomena that hinder unity must be eliminated," and wage an irreconcilable struggle against rightist splitism that harms revolutionary interests. As long as we strengthen revolutionary unity on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, we will be able to smash all the tricks and schemes of the class enemies to sabotage the newly born revolutionary committees, sabotage the People's Liberation Army, and sabotage and split the revolutionary ranks.

Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully play the leading role of the working class in the cultural revolution and all work. The working class should also continuously improve its political awareness in the struggle." Chairman Mao's latest instruction is extremely important and has great significance for us to complete the various tasks at hand. We hope that the Yunnan Provincial Revolutionary Committee and all revolutionary committees across the country will seriously implement Chairman Mao's instruction, strengthen the work of the working-class masses, further arm the working class with Mao Zedong Thought, consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance of the working class by system and by industry, support the revolutionary actions and pioneering spirit of the working class, and play the role of the main force. We must vigorously promote the combination of intellectuals with workers and peasants, humbly learn from the working class, carry forward the proletarian style of unity between theory and practice advocated by Chairman Mao, and resolutely criticize and overcome the bad style of inconsistency between words and deeds among some intellectuals, and oppose all two-faced behavior.

The closer the cultural revolution approaches to overall victory, the better the revolutionary situation becomes, the more desperate the last struggles of a handful of class enemies will be. The revolutionary committees at all levels in Yunnan, local troops, and revolutionary mass organizations must heighten their revolutionary vigilance, strengthen border defense, and prevent the sabotage and disruption of class enemies. We must extensively, deeply, patiently, and meticulously do good ideological and political work, fully mobilize the broad masses to fight against the class enemies, do a good job in cleaning up the class ranks, and firmly strike at a handful of spies, traitors, unrepentant capitalist roaders, and all counter-revolutionaries, resolutely protect state property, maintain revolutionary order, and expose and investigate bad elements. Every revolutionary comrade must closely follow the strategic deployment of our great leader Chairman Mao, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, strictly distinguish between the two different types of contradictions, unite to fight against the enemy, and smash the plots of the counter-revolutionaries behind the scenes to incite the masses to fight against the masses. We must support the army and love the people, seize the revolution, promote production, promote work, promote preparedness, and ensure a double harvest of revolution and production.

The golden sands of the Jinsha River warm the cliffs. The great proletarian heroism of Chairman Mao when he led the Red Army on the Long March forever inspires us to march forward bravely. Under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, the future of the Yunnan Plateau is extremely brilliant. We firmly believe that the heroic sons and daughters of all nationalities in Yunnan, who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, will definitely unite firmly under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters with Chairman Mao as the commander-in-chief and Vice Chairman Lin as the deputy, make new contributions to the overall victory of the cultural revolution, to the defense of national defense, and to the support of the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world!

　　热烈欢呼云南省革命委员会成立
　　《人民日报》《解放军报》社论
    我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动、亲自领导的无产阶级文化大革命，正节节胜利前进的时候，处于祖国西南边疆、国防前哨的云南省革命委员会，在毛主席最新指示的巨大鼓舞下胜利诞生了！
    云南省革命委员会的成立，宣告了中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大一小撮走资派及其在云南的代理人阎红彦、赵健民等企图在云南复辟资本主义的彻底破产，给美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义、各国反动派和蒋介石匪帮以沉重的打击，鼓舞了乘胜前进的全国广大革命人民。
    我们满怀着亲切的无产阶级感情，向在剧烈的阶级斗争中经受了深刻锻炼的云南省两千三百万各族人民和中国人民解放军驻云南部队广大指战员，致以崇高的战斗敬礼！
    以伟大领袖毛主席为首、他的亲密战友林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，非常关怀云南的无产阶级文化大革命。毛主席对云南省的无产阶级文化大革命，多次作了极其英明的指示，给云南革命人民指出了胜利前进的方向。云南省革命委员会成立，是毛泽东思想又一个伟大胜利！是毛主席无产阶级革命路线又一个伟大胜利！
    在云南，也和其他地区一样，无产阶级同资产阶级，社会主义道路同资本主义道路，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线同中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，经历了长期的惊心动魄的斗争。在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，一小撮特务、叛徒、顽固不化的走资派，代表国民党反动派即帝国主义、资产阶级和地、富、反、坏、右的利益，向毛主席的无产阶级革命路线进行了一次又一次的猖狂反扑。无限忠于毛主席的云南省无产阶级革命派，紧跟毛主席，高举“对反动派造反有理”的革命大旗，以大无畏的革命英雄气概，同形形色色的阶级敌人进行了英勇顽强的斗争，粉碎了敌人从右的和极“左”方面的破坏，终于夺得了无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利。
    人民解放军驻云南部队广大指战员，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚定不移地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，坚决支持左派广大群众，在保卫国防和“三支”“两军”的光荣任务中，立下了新的功勋。他们不愧是无产阶级专政和无产阶级文化大革命的忠实保卫者。
    毛主席指出：“我们的人民民主专政的国家制度是保障人民革命的胜利成果和反对内外敌人的复辟阴谋的有力的武器，我们必须牢牢地掌握这个武器。”
    我们希望，云南省革命委员会成立以后，要依靠革命群众，加强无产阶级专政，主动地向阶级敌人发动进攻。为了加强对敌斗争，云南省的无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，一定要在毛泽东思想的基础上进一步紧密地团结起来，用毛泽东思想统一认识、统一步伐、统一行动，批判反动的资产阶级的“多中心论”，实行民主集中制，不断增强革命委员会领导核心的革命团结，军民的革命团结，革命群众组织之间的革命团结和各民族的革命团结。要遵照毛主席“一切妨害团结的现象，都在必须克服之列”的指示，同危害革命利益的右倾分裂主义作不调和的斗争。只要我们加强毛泽东思想基础上的革命团结，我们就能够粉碎阶级敌人破坏新生的革命委员会、破坏人民解放军、破坏和分裂革命队伍的一切阴谋诡计。
    毛主席最近指出：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”毛主席这一最新指示，极其重要，对于我们完成面临的各项任务有重大的意义。希望云南省和全国各革命委员会，认真执行毛主席这一指示，加强工人群众的工作，进一步用毛泽东思想武装工人阶级，巩固和发展工人阶级按系统、按行业的革命的大联合，支持工人阶级的革命行动和首创精神，发挥工人阶级的主力军的作用。要大力促使知识分子同工农兵相结合，虚心向工人阶级学习，发扬毛主席历来倡导的无产阶级的理论和实践一致的作风，坚决批判和克服某些知识分子中那种言行不一的坏作风，反对一切两面派的行为。
    无产阶级文化大革命越是接近全面胜利，革命形势越是大好，一小撮阶级敌人越是要进行垂死的绝望的挣扎。云南省各级革命委员会，各地驻军，各革命群众组织，要提高革命的警惕性，加强边防，严防阶级敌人的破坏和捣乱。要广泛深入地、耐心地、细致地做好思想政治工作，充分发动广大群众起来和阶级敌人作斗争，做好清理阶级队伍的工作，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮特务、叛徒、死不悔改的走资派和一切反革命分子，坚决保护国家财产，维护革命秩序，揭发清查坏人。每一个革命同志都要紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的战略部署，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，团结对敌，粉碎幕后的反革命分子挑动群众斗群众的阴谋。要拥军爱民，抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备，保证革命生产双丰收。
    金沙水拍云崖暖。毛主席当年率领红军长征时伟大的无产阶级英雄气概，永远激励着我们勇敢前进。在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，云南高原的前程无比灿烂辉煌。我们坚信，无限忠于毛主席的云南各族英雄儿女，一定会坚定地团结在毛泽东思想旗帜下，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的率领下，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，为保卫国防和支援世界人民的革命斗争，做出新的贡献！
