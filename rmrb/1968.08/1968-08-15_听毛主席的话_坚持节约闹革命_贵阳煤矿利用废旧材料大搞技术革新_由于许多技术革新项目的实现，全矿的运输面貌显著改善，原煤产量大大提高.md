Listen to Chairman Mao's Words, Persist in Frugality to Make Revolution

Guizhou Coal Mine Utilizes Old Materials for Major Technological Innovations

Due to the implementation of many technological innovation projects, the mine's transportation conditions have significantly improved, and the raw coal output has greatly increased.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Guizhou: The revolutionary workers of Guizhou Coal Mine, following the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction to "be frugal and make revolution," have utilized old materials to carry out major technological innovations, achieving great success.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, revolutionary workers exposed and criticized the crimes of China's Khrushchev's agents in the mine who sabotaged technological innovations. They relied on self-reliance, utilizing old materials to carry out major technological innovations. In the past two months, this coal mine has implemented ten technological innovation projects, all of which were achieved by workers through self-reliance and the use of old materials.

Mine transportation is the weakest link in this mine. Previously, mine cars were pushed by hand, and coal was unloaded by hand, resulting in high labor intensity and low efficiency. Workers focused on technological innovations in this area. The No. 1 mine has a large hoist that has been in use for many years, capable of pulling only three mine cars at a time. In the past, the capitalist roaders repeatedly rejected workers' suggestions to modify the large hoist to improve transportation efficiency. Recently, the leaders of the mine's revolutionary committee, together with revolutionary workers and revolutionary technical personnel, thoroughly modified the electric and pulley parts of the large hoist, doubling the transportation efficiency. They also changed the transportation route at the mine mouth, utilizing the slope for sliding, significantly shortening the transportation time. The revolutionary workers of the No. 2 mine successfully tested an electric coal unloading device using old materials, achieving automation in coal unloading, which not only improved transportation efficiency but also reduced the labor intensity of workers. Due to the implementation of many technological innovation projects, the overall transportation conditions of the mine have significantly improved, and the raw coal output has greatly increased.

    据新华社贵阳电　贵阳煤矿革命工人遵照伟大领袖毛主席“要节约闹革命”的教导，利用废旧材料，大搞技术革新，取得很大成绩。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，革命工人揭露和批判了中国赫鲁晓夫在矿里的代理人破坏技术革新的罪行。他们靠自力更生，利用废旧材料大搞技术革新。最近两个月来，这个煤矿实现的十项技术革新项目，都是工人自力更生，利用废旧材料搞成的。
    矿井运输是这个矿最薄弱的环节。以前，矿车靠人力推，卸煤靠人力倒，劳动强度大，效率低。工人们就在这方面大搞技术革新。一号矿井有部大绞车，已经使用了多年，一次只能拉三个矿车。过去走资派对工人多次提出的改造大绞车、提高运输效率的建议，一直卡住不采纳。不久以前，矿井革委会负责人同革命工人、革命技术人员一起，把大绞车的电动部分和轱辘等作了一番彻底改造，使运输效率提高了一倍。他们还改变了井口的运输线路，利用坡度滑行，大大缩短了运输时间。二号矿井的革命职工，利用废旧材料试制成功电动翻罐笼，使卸煤自动化，既提高了运输效率，又减轻了工人的劳动强度。由于许多技术革新项目的实现，全矿的运输面貌得到了显著改善，原煤产量大大提高。
