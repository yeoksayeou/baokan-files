A Malian friend said, Chairman Mao's thoughts on people's war are genius thoughts. He recited a quote from Chairman Mao: "Weapons are an important factor in war, but they are not the decisive factor; it is people, not things, that are decisive." He went on to say, "This is very correct." Another Malian friend enthusiastically praised the important role played by the Chinese People's Liberation Army in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He said, as Chairman Mao pointed out, "Without a people's army, there is nothing."

	A military officer from the Malian military delegation that recently visited China said, the Chinese People's Liberation Army is indeed a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. The Chinese People's Liberation Army undertakes various tasks, working with the people to participate in the Cultural Revolution, production, and national defense, truly a people's army. The Chinese People's Liberation Army is our shining example.

    新华社科纳克里二日电　中国驻几内亚大使馆临时代办林秉南七月三十一日晚上在几内亚首都科纳克里举行招待会，庆祝中国人民解放军建军四十一周年。
    一百五十多位几内亚朋友出席了招待会，其中有：几内亚人民军总参谋长凯塔·努曼迪安将军，运输国务秘书莫里·凯塔和负责外交事务的国务秘书迪亚洛·阿尔法·阿卜杜拉耶。
    在招待会上，一些几内亚朋友和非洲自由战士们热烈赞扬无产阶级的伟大导师毛主席，伟大的毛泽东思想，光荣的中国人民解放军和中几两国人民和军队之间的战斗友谊。他们都热诚和衷心祝愿伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！
    凯塔·努曼迪安将军热情地称赞中国人民解放军说：中国人民解放军是一支新型的军队，为几内亚人民军树立了学习的榜样。
    一位几内亚朋友说：中国人民解放军由于有伟大领袖毛主席的正确和英明的领导，已成为一支不可战胜的伟大军队。毛主席不仅是中国人民的伟大领袖，而且是全世界各国人民的伟大领袖。
    一位非洲自由战士说：“毛主席身体非常健康，这是中国人民最大的幸福”。他衷心祝愿毛主席万寿无疆！
    新华社巴马科二日电　中国驻马里大使馆临时代办刘和林，一日晚在巴马科举行酒会，庆祝中国人民解放军建军四十一周年。
    约二百三十名客人出席了招待会，其中有：保卫革命全国委员会委员、总统府负责国防和安全的部长级代表马马杜·迪亚基特，保卫革命全国委员会委员戴维·库利巴利和凯塔·纳马，贸易部长阿塔埃尔·梅加，马里发展银行行长蒂埃乌勒·科纳特，总统府办公厅主任提贾尼·居伊斯，外交部秘书长比拉马·特拉奥雷。
    招待会是在友好和热烈的气氛中进行的。马马杜·迪亚基特请刘和林转达马里人民和军队对中国人民解放军的敬意。马里朋友们热烈赞扬毛主席关于人民战争和建设人民军队的光辉思想。一位马里朋友说，毛主席关于人民战争的思想是天才的思想。他背诵了一条毛主席语录：“武器是战争的重要的因素，但不是决定的因素，决定的因素是人不是物。”他接着说：“这是非常正确的。”另一位马里朋友热烈赞扬中国人民解放军在无产阶级文化大革命中所起的非常重要的作用。他说，正象毛主席指出的：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”
    前不久访问中国的马里军事代表团的一位军官说，中国人民解放军的确是毛泽东思想的大学校。中国人民解放军担负起多方面的任务，同人民一道参加文化大革命，参加生产，保卫祖国，真正是一支人民的军队。中国人民解放军是我们的光辉的榜样。
