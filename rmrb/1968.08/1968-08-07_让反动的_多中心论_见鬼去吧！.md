Let the reactionary "multi-center theory" go to hell!

Guiyang Cotton Mill Revolutionary Committee

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The core force leading our cause is the Communist Party of China." Vice Chairman Lin instructs us: "Our country is a great proletarian dictatorship socialist state with seven hundred million people, and it needs a unified ideology, a revolutionary ideology, a correct ideology, which is Mao Zedong Thought." The proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin is the sole leadership center for the entire Party, the entire army, and the entire nation; the great Mao Zedong Thought is the sole guiding ideology for the entire Party, the entire army, and the entire nation. We must unify our will, our steps, and our actions under the battle orders issued by the proletarian headquarters. What "multi-center theory," what "me as the center," are all reactionary fallacies of the bourgeoisie, all thoroughly anti-Mao Zedong Thought rubbish, and must be thoroughly criticized. Let the reactionary "multi-center theory" go to hell!

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's "Bombard the Headquarters" big-character poster and a series of latest instructions, and under the direct command of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, after more than two years of magnificent revolutionary struggle, we have thoroughly smashed the bourgeois headquarters led by China's Khrushchev, achieving decisive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. However, a handful of unrepentant capitalist roaders, traitors, spies, and untransformed landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists will not accept their defeat and will struggle to the death. A handful of class enemies spread rumors, slander, and incite discord, disrupting Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, which shows that as the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution approaches total victory, class struggle becomes more complex and profound. At this critical moment, we must raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, unite more closely around the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment without deviating even a step, implementing the proletarian headquarters' orders without the slightest deviation. We must, under the wise leadership of the proletarian headquarters, strengthen the proletarian dictatorship, strengthen the struggle against the enemy, further carry out a thorough and in-depth revolutionary criticism, do a good job of cleaning up the class ranks, and thoroughly carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in each unit, pushing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!

　　让反动的“多中心论”见鬼去吧！
　　贵阳棉纺厂革命委员会
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党。”林副主席指示我们：“我国是一个伟大的无产阶级专政的社会主义国家，有七亿人口，需要有一个统一的思想，革命的思想，正确的思想，这就是毛泽东思想。”以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，是全党、全军、全国唯一的领导中心；伟大的毛泽东思想，是全党、全军和全国唯一的指导思想。我们只能在无产阶级司令部发出的战斗号令下，统一意志，统一步伐，统一行动。什么“多中心论”，什么“以我为中心”，都是一些资产阶级的反动谬论，都是彻头彻尾反毛泽东思想的破烂货，必须彻底批判。让反动的“多中心论”见鬼去吧！
    在毛主席《炮打司令部》的大字报和一系列最新指示的指引下，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的直接指挥下，经过两年多轰轰烈烈的伟大革命斗争，我们已经彻底摧毁了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，取得了无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利。但是，一小撮死不改悔的走资派、叛徒、特务和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，决不甘心于他们的失败，而且越临近死亡，就越要作垂死的挣扎。一小撮阶级敌人造谣诬蔑、挑拨离间，破坏毛主席的伟大战略部署，正说明无产阶级文化大革命越接近全面胜利，阶级斗争越是复杂，越是深刻。在这个关键时刻，我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更加紧密地团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的周围，做到紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署寸步不离，不折不扣地贯彻执行无产阶级司令部的一切号令。我们一定要在无产阶级司令部的英明领导下，加强无产阶级专政，加强对敌斗争，进一步持久而深入地开展革命大批判，切实做好清理阶级队伍的工作，搞好各单位的斗、批、改，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
