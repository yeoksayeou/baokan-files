Over the past year, we have personally witnessed how the revolutionary teachers and students of Beijing No. 60 Middle School have followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought, and achieved continuous victories in the Cultural Revolution. Our experience is this: following the great leader Chairman Mao is victory.

At a time when hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses, under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, are advancing swiftly to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution, the glorious day of the second anniversary of the publication of the great program of the Cultural Revolution—"The Sixteen Points"—has arrived. This epoch-making Marxist-Leninist document, personally drafted by the great leader Chairman Mao, is the beacon guiding the hundreds of millions of cultural revolutionaries to advance bravely. Over the past year, while performing military and political training tasks at Beijing No. 60 Middle School, we have personally witnessed how the broad revolutionary teachers and students, under the guidance of the glorious "Sixteen Points" and Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, have followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, resolutely executed all battle orders from Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters, and achieved continuous victories in the school's Cultural Revolution.

After the Cultural Revolution began, the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, fearing that revolutionary teachers and students would rise up to rebel against them, hastily sent in work teams to suppress the revolutionary mass movement. The "Sixteen Points," personally drafted by Chairman Mao, declared the bankruptcy of the capitalist reactionary line promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev. The broad revolutionary teachers and students wielded the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, launched a fierce attack on the Chinese Khrushchev and the Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique, and thoroughly criticized the capitalist reactionary line. Under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, the broad revolutionary teachers, students, and staff achieved revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, seizing back the educational front of No. 60 Middle School for the proletariat.

Last May, after the revolutionary committee was established, the majority of revolutionary teachers and students enthusiastically responded to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao to resume classes and carry out the revolution. However, a minority of teachers and students, influenced by the instigation of a handful of class enemies and anarchist ideas, could not sit still or study, saying things like, "Sitting in the classroom to attend classes doesn't look like a rebel," and "Rebels should continue to charge into society." Just as the two viewpoints were engaged in fierce debate, the People's Daily published the important editorial "On Resuming Classes and Carrying Out the Revolution in Primary, Middle, and High Schools," once again conveying the voice of Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters, deeply educating the broad revolutionary teachers and students. Those who had insisted on "stopping classes to carry out the revolution" also changed their minds and actively participated in resuming classes and carrying out the revolution. They deeply felt that Chairman Mao's books must be read every day, Chairman Mao's words must be listened to, Chairman Mao's instructions must be thoroughly carried out, and Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment must be followed closely.

What exactly should be resumed and what revolution should be carried out in resuming classes and carrying out the revolution? There was also fierce debate in No. 60 Middle School. Some teachers and students believed that since it is about resuming classes, all cultural courses should be resumed; others believed that resuming all cultural courses is a return to the old ways, a return to suppressing the revolution. At this time, we assisted the revolutionary committee in guiding the broad revolutionary teachers and students to study Chairman Mao's instructions on educational revolution, study the section on "Teaching Reform" in the "Sixteen Points," and study related editorials in the People's Daily, analyzing the situation of the school's Cultural Revolution and the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation facing them. The broad revolutionary teachers and students realized that "resuming classes and carrying out the revolution" is a strategic deployment by Chairman Mao for the proletarian Cultural Revolution in schools, aiming to promote the school's struggle, criticism, and transformation through practice and reform, thoroughly reforming the old educational system, teaching policies, and methods, establishing a brand-new educational system for the proletariat, and ultimately ending the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools. Therefore, it is neither about stopping classes to carry out the revolution nor about resuming classes to suppress the revolution, but about strictly following Chairman Mao's instructions: "resume classes and carry out the revolution." After raising their awareness, we guided the teachers, students, and staff to deeply carry out revolutionary criticism in resuming classes and carrying out the revolution, taking classes as units, exposing and criticizing the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev in promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line and attempting to restore capitalism. The broad revolutionary teachers and students deeply understood that the Chinese Khrushchev's promotion of the revisionist educational line has countless sins, with the greatest sin being opposing the establishment of Mao Zedong Thought in schools. Therefore, their first major reform in resuming classes and carrying out the revolution was to make studying Chairman Mao's works the main course, making the establishment of Mao Zedong Thought in schools the fundamental task of the educational revolution, and extensively, deeply, and persistently carrying out the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. Over the past year, the school has held two conferences for active participants in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. The broad revolutionary teachers and students read Chairman Mao's works every day, and each teaching class holds a lecture meeting every week, universally establishing study groups for Chairman Mao's works both inside and outside the school. The school has produced a large number of models in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, initially forming a core team of activists in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, including revolutionary cadres, teachers, and students. The great Mao Zedong Thought has gradually occupied this educational front of No. 60 Middle School.

"Navigating the vast sea relies on the helmsman; carrying out the revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." Because the broad revolutionary teachers and students have grasped the fundamental task of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in resuming classes and carrying out the revolution and in the proletarian educational revolution, their revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline have greatly increased. The great Mao Zedong Thought has taken deeper root in people's minds. Before the Cultural Revolution, the school long propagated the saying, "Divide, divide, the lifeline of students; examine, examine, the treasure of teachers." Now, revolutionary teachers and students realize that grades are not the lifeline of students, and examinations are not the treasure of teachers; these are the spiritual shackles that the Chinese Khrushchev placed on the necks of teachers and students through the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line. Only the invincible Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline, the only treasure for preventing and opposing revisionism and cultivating reliable successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. Studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, has become the conscious action of the broad revolutionary teachers and students. Recently, after the proletarian headquarters of Chairman Mao issued the great instruction to "face the countryside, face the border, face the factories and mines, face the grassroots," the graduating students enthusiastically responded. Currently, nearly four hundred students have taken the path of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers, and more than two hundred students are about to set off for the border.

Over the past two years, the great practice of the Cultural Revolution has proven that the revolutionary Red Guards and the broad revolutionary teachers, students, and staff listen most to Chairman Mao's words. In their minds, there is only one leadership center for the entire Party, the entire army, and the entire nation, which is the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. As long as it is a battle order issued by Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters, they will resolutely execute and carry it out. Conversely, any words and deeds that go against the battle orders of Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters will be resolutely resisted and fought against.

Currently, the broad revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of No. 60 Middle School are following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, cleaning up the class ranks, and rooting out the hidden handful of class enemies. They are determined to be even more loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, resolutely criticizing the reactionary "multi-center theory," and under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and guided by the glorious "Sixteen Points" and Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, unifying their will, steps, and actions, to carry the Cultural Revolution to the end!

    一年多来，我们亲眼看到六十中革命师生紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，活学活用毛泽东思想，全校文化大革命节节胜利，伟大的毛泽东思想已经逐步占领了六十中这块教育阵地。我们的体会是——
　　紧跟伟大领袖毛主席就是胜利
　　海军某部驻北京六十中军训团
    正当亿万革命群众，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的领导下，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利而迅猛前进的时候，无产阶级文化大革命的伟大纲领——“十六条”发表两周年的光辉日子到来了。伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的这个划时代的马克思列宁主义文献，是指引亿万文化革命大军奋勇前进的光辉灯塔。一年多来，我们在北京六十中学执行军政训练任务，亲眼看到广大革命师生，在光辉的“十六条”和毛主席一系列最新指示指引下，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级司令部的一切战斗号令，取得了全校文化大革命的节节胜利。
    无产阶级文化大革命开始以后，党内最大的一小撮走资派，生怕革命师生起来造他们的反，迫不及待地派来工作组，镇压革命的群众运动。毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”，宣告了中国赫鲁晓夫推行的资产阶级反动路线的破产。广大革命师生，奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，大造了中国赫鲁晓夫和彭真反革命修正主义集团的反，狠批了资产阶级反动路线。广大革命师生员工，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的领导下，实现了革命的大联合和革命的三结合，把六十中这块教育阵地夺回到无产阶级的手里。
    去年五月，革命委员会成立以后，多数革命师生热烈响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召，实行复课闹革命。但是，少数师生由于受到一小撮阶级敌人的挑动和无政府主义思潮的影响，坐不下来，学不进去，说什么“坐在教室里上课，不象个造反派的样子”，“造反派就应当继续到社会上去冲杀”。正当两种意见展开激烈辩论的时候，《人民日报》发表了《再论大中小学校都要复课闹革命》的重要社论，再次传达了毛主席的无产阶级司令部的声音，使广大革命师生受到深刻的教育。原来坚持要“停课闹革命”的一部分师生，也转变了认识，积极参加了复课闹革命。他们深有感触地说：毛主席的书必须天天读，毛主席的话必须句句听，毛主席的指示必须彻底执行，毛主席的伟大战略部署必须紧跟。
    复课闹革命究竟复什么课，闹什么革命？在六十中也有过激烈争论。一部分师生认为，既然是复课，就要全面地复文化课；另一部分师生则认为，全面复文化课，就是复旧，就是复课压革命。这时候，我们协助革命委员会引导广大革命师生，学习了毛主席关于教育革命的指示，学习了“十六条”关于《教学改革》一节以及《人民日报》的有关社论，分析了学校文化大革命的形势和面临的斗批改任务。广大革命师生认识到，“复课闹革命”，是毛主席关于学校无产阶级文化大革命的一个战略部署，其目的是要通过边实践、边改革，推动学校的斗批改，彻底改革旧的教育制度、教学方针和方法，创立无产阶级的崭新的教育制度，最后结束资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象。因此，既不能停课闹革命，也不能复课压革命，而是要不折不扣地执行毛主席的指示：“复课闹革命”。认识提高以后，我们就引导师生员工在复课闹革命中，以班级为单位，深入开展革命大批判，狠狠揭露和批判中国赫鲁晓夫推行反革命修正主义教育路线和妄图复辟资本主义的滔天罪行。广大革命师生深刻地认识到，中国赫鲁晓夫推行修正主义教育路线有千条罪恶，万条罪恶，最大的罪恶就是反对在学校中大立毛泽东思想。因此，他们在复课闹革命中的第一个重大改革，就是把学习毛主席著作做为主课，把在学校大立毛泽东思想作为教育革命的根本任务，广泛、深入、持久地开展活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动。一年多来，全校已开过两次活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子大会。广大革命师生天天读毛主席著作，各教学班每周都召开讲用会，普遍建立了校内、校外学习毛主席著作小组。全校涌现了一大批活学活用毛泽东思想的标兵，初步形成了一支包括有革命干部、教师和学生的活学活用毛泽东思想的骨干队伍。伟大的毛泽东思想逐步占领了六十中这块教育阵地。
      “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”由于广大革命师生在复课闹革命和无产阶级教育革命中，狠抓了活学活用毛泽东思想这个根本，因此，革命性、科学性和组织纪律性大大增强。伟大的毛泽东思想越来越深地在人们头脑里扎下根来。文化大革命以前，学校里长期流传着“分，分，学生的命根；考，考，老师的法宝”这种说法。现在，革命师生认识到，分数并不是学生的命根，考试也并不是老师的法宝，这些都是中国赫鲁晓夫推行反革命修正主义教育路线套在师生脖子上的精神枷锁，只有战无不胜的毛泽东思想，才是我们的命根子，才是防修、反修，培养无产阶级革命事业可靠接班人的唯一法宝。活学活用毛泽东思想，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，已经成为广大革命师生自觉的行动。最近毛主席的无产阶级司令部发出“面向农村，面向边疆，面向工矿，面向基层”的伟大指示以后，应届毕业的同学热烈响应。目前，已有近四百名同学走向同工农兵相结合的道路，还有二百多名同学，即将奔赴边疆。
    两年来，无产阶级文化大革命的伟大实践，证明革命红卫兵和广大革命师生员工，最听毛主席的话。在他们心目中，全党、全军、全国只有一个领导中心，这就是以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部。只要是毛主席的无产阶级司令部发出的战斗号令，他们就坚决执行，坚决照办。反之，凡是违背毛主席的无产阶级司令部的战斗号令的言行，他们就坚决抵制，坚决斗争。
    目前，六十中的广大革命师生员工，正在紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，清理阶级队伍，深挖暗藏的一小撮阶级敌人。他们决心更加无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，坚决批判反动的“多中心论”，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的领导下，在光辉的“十六条”和毛主席的一系列最新指示的指引下，统一意志，统一步伐，统一行动，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
