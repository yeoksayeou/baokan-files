	Newspaper: New China News Agency, Bonn, August 15

	On August 15, about 100 young students in Hamburg, West Germany, stormed the Hamburg Court to protest strongly against the court's unreasonable trial and sentencing of a young man to imprisonment. The young man was sentenced to four months in prison on trumped-up charges for participating in a student demonstration in April this year.

	Some protesters rushed into the courtroom and shouted slogans of protest, making it impossible for the trial to continue. Angry protesters also threw rotten eggs and bags filled with red dye at the court walls and corridors.

	The Hamburg authorities quickly mobilized a large number of police to suppress the protesting students, and many students were arrested.

	On August 12, 200 more technicians at Britain's largest commercial television organization, the Independent Television Company, went on strike, demanding higher wages and improved working conditions.

	These 200 technicians defied the company's threat that "striking would mean self-dismissal" and resolutely went on strike. At the same time, the other 3,000 technicians at this television company, who have been on strike since August 4, continue their strike.

	On August 12 and 13, bus drivers and conductors in Wolverhampton and Northampton also went on strike. In Wolverhampton, about 300 buses were halted, causing the entire city's public transportation to come to a standstill. In Northampton, 260 drivers and conductors participated in the strike.

    一些示威者冲进了审讯厅并且高呼抗议口号，使得审判无法进行下去。愤怒的示威者还向法院墙上和走廊扔了臭鸡蛋和装满红色颜料的口袋。
    汉堡当局匆忙出动大批警察镇压示威学生，许多学生被逮捕。
