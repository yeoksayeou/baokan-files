Workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the smartest and most talented

Revolutionary workers in Yangyuan County Farm Tool Factory have thoroughly criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of "expert management" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev. They have resolutely relied on the factory's own equipment and technology, walking the revolutionary path of self-design and self-manufacture. They have successfully trial-produced an eight-horsepower comprehensive utilization diesel engine and a small tractor suitable for mountain farming.

	From the masses, to the masses

In late May, the Revolutionary Committee of Yangyuan County Farm Tool Factory organized the repair team to go to the fields, wells, and machinery sites to repair irrigation machinery on the spot to support the anti-drought struggle.

One day, while inspecting the machinery, worker Ma Yumin from the repair team was asked by the masses, "Our commune has several eight-horsepower diesel engines. Can you find a way to make these diesel engines not only irrigate fields and grind grain but also spread fertilizer, pull soil, and pull water?"

Ma Yumin thought, "If we can reform the diesel engines to be more versatile, their utilization rate would be higher. This is a good way to serve agriculture." He immediately promised the masses that he would report this to the factory and find a solution to the problem.

Upon returning to the factory, Ma Yumin immediately reported the masses' request and his own thoughts to the workshop foreman Sun Qingkui. After learning about this, the factory Revolutionary Committee immediately held a meeting to discuss the matter. Everyone agreed that the masses' suggestion was a great show of trust in the Revolutionary Committee and all revolutionary workers. Yangyuan County has more than 200 eight-horsepower diesel engines. If all of them can be used for plowing, it will greatly benefit the entire county, especially the mountainous areas, in expanding the mechanized farming area, saving labor, and further developing agricultural production.

Members of the Revolutionary Committee, with this problem and initial ideas in mind, went to the workshops, teams, and dormitories to consult with the workers. The opinions of the poor and lower-middle peasants immediately spread throughout the factory. Many workers, in light of the specific conditions of their own factory and workshop, conducted analysis, discussion, and research. Chairman Mao said, "Under the leadership of the Communist Party, as long as there are people, any miracle in the world can be created." The factory Revolutionary Committee, based on Chairman Mao's great teachings and the opinions of the workers, decided to fully utilize the existing equipment and conditions within the factory and immediately conduct experiments in the repair workshop. All revolutionary workers in the factory unanimously supported the decision of the Revolutionary Committee, expressing their determination, issuing challenges, and actively joining the battle. They said: We will resolutely implement the masses' revolutionary suggestions and use facts to smash the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line of "expert management"!

	Fiercely criticize the Chinese Khrushchev,
	Thoroughly smash the "expert management" line

A battle to reform the diesel engines and trial-produce tractors began throughout the factory. The first difficulty the revolutionary workers in the repair workshop encountered was the lack of blueprints and technicians. At this time, the deputy director of the Revolutionary Committee, Xiao Bingqing, and committee member Wang Dianjun, who were fighting alongside the workers, followed the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "holding study classes is a good method, many problems can be solved in study classes," and organized all the workers in the workshop to hold a frontline study class. Everyone, armed with Chairman Mao's teaching of "Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction is criticism, is revolution. Destruction must be reasoned, and reasoning is construction. Destruction comes first, and construction is within it," as a weapon, summarized the facts of successfully trial-producing and mass-producing the versatile grinding machine after the factory was established in 1958, under the conditions of having no blueprints and no technicians, relying on their own strength. In practice, everyone further realized that revolutionary criticism is the driving force for the victory of all work!

Workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the smartest and most talented. They took the workshop as the battlefield and revolutionary criticism as the driving force, using the method of great debate, with everyone thinking and finding solutions, gradually overcoming the difficulties of equipment, raw materials, technology, and so on. For example, the main component of the tractor, the clutch, is composed of several parts. Someone said: These important parts can only be produced in Shanghai and must be bought... But the workers firmly believed in "people first" and resolutely relied on the factory's own equipment and technology, walking the revolutionary path of self-design and self-manufacture. To manufacture the main component of the clutch, the sliding arrow shaft, the fitter Han Ju, with deep hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev and an endless loyalty to Chairman Mao, after days and nights of painstaking research, finding reference books, and consulting with experienced teachers, through repeated experiments, finally succeeded in making it. In the battle, the workers actively applied Chairman Mao's teaching of "strategically, we must despise all enemies; tactically, we must take all enemies seriously," gradually conquering many technically complex and high-precision technical difficulties.

The workers said with revolutionary enthusiasm: "We are not afraid of difficulties, but we are afraid of not recognizing difficulties, not understanding difficulties, and not overcoming difficulties. We are afraid of being timid in the face of difficulties. As long as we dare to recognize the world, we can change the world. With the great Mao Zedong Thought, we can overcome all difficulties and defeat all enemies."

	The product of the struggle between the two lines

After more than forty days of arduous struggle, the eight-horsepower comprehensive utilization diesel engine and the small tractor suitable for mountain farming were finally successfully trial-produced.

This ironclad fact powerfully refuted those with rightist conservative thoughts. During the first test run, due to installation problems, the test run did not proceed. At this time, some people sneered and said, "Look, it doesn't move. Quickly go to the production team and borrow an old cow to pull it!" Others said, "Can a phoenix fly out of a chicken coop?" Some people who thought they were technically proficient and had ulterior motives, after the trial production began, secretly notified the owner to pull away the eight-horsepower diesel engine that the factory had decided to use for the experiment, attempting to obstruct this experiment.

Facing these problems, the factory Revolutionary Committee and all the workers, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forget class struggle," promptly analyzed and studied, believing that this was a concrete manifestation of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. The success or failure of this experiment was of great significance. We must take class struggle as the key link, resolutely seize the complete victory of this experiment, use facts to educate those with rightist conservative thoughts, help them raise their awareness, eliminate the poison of the Chinese Khrushchev, and educate those who believe in technical "authorities" and "expert management," and severely strike down the sabotage activities of a handful of class enemies. Thus, the cold mockery and obstruction of the trial production work were finally defeated one by one in front of the workers.

After the first test run failed, everyone fought for a day and night, disassembling and checking all the parts. The second test run was completely successful, and the workers in the entire factory were overjoyed. They shouted in unison, "This is the great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!" Those who originally thought that "a phoenix could fly out of a chicken coop" also had to admit defeat in the face of facts. Under the shining light of Mao Zedong Thought, in the hands of the workers of Yangyuan County Farm Tool Factory, a "phoenix" finally flew out!

Now, the flames of revolutionary criticism in this factory are burning more fiercely, the political enthusiasm of the broad revolutionary workers is unprecedentedly high, and the revolutionary and production situation is getting better and better. They are determined to fully implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, seize new victories in revolutionary production, and make new contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人最聪明最有才能
    阳原县农具厂革命大批判推动技术革命大发展
      革命职工大破中国赫鲁晓夫“专家治厂”的反革命修正主义路线，坚决依靠本厂的设备和技术，走自己设计、自己制造的革命道路，试制成功八马力综合利用柴油机、适合山地耕作的小型拖拉机
      从群众中来到群众中去
    五月下旬，河北省阳原县农具厂革委会为了支援抗旱斗争，组织机修组工人到田间井旁机器边，就地修理排灌机械。
    一天，机修工马玉印同志在检验机器时，群众问他：“我们社有好几台柴油机，都是八马力的。你们给想个办法，让这些柴油机不光能浇地、磨面，最好还能送粪、拉土、拉水才好。”
    小马想：对呀！要是把柴油机改革一下，能综合利用，使用率就更高了。这是为农业服务的好办法。他当即向群众表示一定向厂里反映，想办法解决这个问题。
    马玉印回厂后，立即向机修车间组长孙庆魁反映了群众的要求和他自己的想法。厂革委会知道这件事之后，立即开会研究。大家认为：群众这条意见，是对厂革委会和全体革命工人的最大信任。阳原县共有八马力柴油机二百多台，如果都能用来耕地，对全县，特别是对山区扩大机耕面积，节约劳力，进一步发展农业生产，将起更大的作用。
    革委会成员带着这个问题和初步想法，分头深入到车间、小组、宿舍，向工人请教。贫下中农的意见，立即在全厂传开，许多职工结合本厂本车间的具体情况，进行了分析、讨论、研究。毛主席说：“在共产党领导下，只要有了人，什么人间奇迹也可以造出来。”厂革委会根据毛主席这一伟大教导和工人群众的意见，决定：按照毛主席“要节约闹革命”的教导，充分利用厂内现有设备条件，立即在机修车间进行试验。全厂革命职工一致拥护革委会的决定，纷纷表决心，下战书，积极投入战斗。他们说：我们要坚决实现群众的革命化建议，用事实砸烂中国赫鲁晓夫的“专家治厂”的反革命修正主义路线！
      狠批中国赫鲁晓夫，
    大破“专家治厂”路线
    一场改革柴油机、试制拖拉机的战斗在全厂开始了。机修车间革命职工遇到的第一个难题，就是没有图纸和技术员。这时和工人一起战斗的革委会副主任萧秉清、委员王佃俊，遵照伟大领袖毛主席“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的教导，组织全车间职工办起了火线学习班。大家以毛主席“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。破，就要讲道理，讲道理就是立，破字当头，立也就在其中了”的教导为武器，总结了一九五八年建厂以后，在没有图纸、没有技术员的条件下，依靠自己的力量，试制成功和大量生产万能磨粉机的事实，批驳了中国赫鲁晓夫“专家治厂”的反革命修正主义路线。在实践中，大家进一步认识到：革命大批判是推动一切工作胜利前进的动力！
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人，最聪明，最有才能。他们以车间为战场，以革命大批判为动力，采取大辩论的方法，人人动脑子，想办法，逐个地突破了设备、原材料、技术等难关。如拖拉机的主要部件离合器，由若干种机件组成。有人说：这些重要部件只有上海才能生产，非买不可……。可是，工人们坚信“人的因素第一”，坚决依靠本厂的设备和技术，走自己设计、自己制造的革命道路。为了制造离合器的主要机件滑箭轴，钳工韩巨带着对中国赫鲁晓夫的深仇大恨，怀着无限忠于毛主席的一颗红心，经过几天几夜的苦心钻研，找参考书，和有经验的老师傅商量，经过反复试验，终于制成了。在战斗中，工人们活学活用毛主席“在战略上我们要藐视一切敌人，在战术上我们要重视一切敌人”的教导，逐个征服了许多技术复杂、精密程度高的技术难关。
    工人们满怀革命豪情地说：“有困难不怕，怕的是我们不认识困难，不去了解困难，不去战胜困难，在困难面前畏首畏尾。只要我们大胆去认识世界，就能改造世界，我们有了伟大的毛泽东思想，就能战胜一切困难，压倒一切敌人。”
    两条路线斗争的产物
    经过四十多天的艰苦奋战，八马力的综合利用柴油机、适合山地耕作的小型拖拉机，终于试制成功了。
    这一铁的事实有力地驳斥了那些有右倾保守思想的人们。在第一次试车时，由于安装方面的毛病，试车不走。这时，有些人就讥讽地说：“看，不走吧，赶快到生产队借老牛来拉吧！”还有的说什么：“鸡窝里还能飞出凤凰来？”有一些自以为技术高明的别有用心的人，在试制开始后，将原来厂里决定做试验用的一台八马力柴油机，暗地通知货主拉走，妄图以此来阻挡这场试验。
    面对这些问题，厂革委会和全体职工遵照毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，及时地进行了分析研究，认为这是阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的具体表现，这场试验成功与否关系重大。我们一定要以阶级斗争为纲，坚决夺取这次试验的全部胜利，用事实教育有右倾保守思想的人，帮助他们提高认识，肃清中国赫鲁晓夫的流毒，教育一些迷信技术“权威”“专家治厂”的人，狠狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人的破坏活动。这样，一些冷讽热嘲和刁难阻挡试制工作的企图，终于在工人面前，一个一个地破产了。
    第一次试车失败后，大家奋战一昼夜，将全部机件拆卸检修。第二次试车完全成功，全厂工人欢喜若狂。同声高呼：“这是毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利！”一些原来认为“鸡窝里还能飞出凤凰来”的人在事实面前也低头服输了。在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在阳原县农具厂工人手里，终于飞出“凤凰”来了！
    现在，这个厂革命大批判的烈火越烧越旺，广大革命职工的政治热情空前高涨，革命、生产形势越来越好。他们决心全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，夺取革命生产的新胜利，为无产阶级文化大革命再立新功。
