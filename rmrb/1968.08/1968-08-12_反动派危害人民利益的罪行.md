The reactionaries' crimes against the people's interests

The U.S. imperialists, who have been defeated by the heroic Vietnamese people, are desperately struggling in their death throes. They have even conscripted Japanese youths visiting the U.S. to send them to South Vietnam as cannon fodder. According to a report by the Japanese newspaper *Shakai Shinpo* on August 4, a Japanese company employee named Tashima Shigeo was conscripted by the U.S. authorities while traveling in the U.S. last September under the provisions of the U.S. conscription law. After training, Tashima was sent to the South Vietnamese battlefield via the U.S. base near Tokyo on July 24. Tashima called his company boss from the U.S. base in Tokyo, saying he had been conscripted by the U.S. authorities to serve as an American artillery soldier. He was to leave for South Vietnam after staying at the base for one and a half hours.

The fascist military regime in Indonesia is hastening to sell out its maritime rights. According to a report by Western news agencies, the Indonesian fascist military regime recently issued a regulation inviting foreign fishing monopolies to invest in Indonesia's maritime fishing industry, opening up all of Indonesia's maritime territory to all foreign fishing monopolies. The regulation stipulates that foreign monopolies can fish for shrimp and fish in the waters of Sulawesi, Maluku, West Irian, Sumatra, and Kalimantan, and can harvest oysters and seaweed in all of Indonesia's maritime territory.

According to a report by the Antara News Agency, by the end of July, the Indonesian reactionaries had already approved six foreign fishing companies to plunder pearls, shrimp, and various types of fish in Indonesia's maritime territory.

The Indonesian fascist military regime's actions of selling out sovereignty have caused great harm to Indonesia's domestic fishing industry. In the North Sumatra region alone, the fishing industry will lose $4 million in revenue each year.

The Thanom group in Thailand has sold out sovereignty, allowing the U.S. imperialists to build a large base. According to a report by a Thai newspaper on August 6, a reactionary leader of the Thanom sellout group admitted on August 5 that the Thai Meteorological Department had long been a tool for the U.S. to expand its aggression in Vietnam. It "often uses balloons and instruments supplied by the U.S. to measure the climate of the high atmosphere and space and reports to the U.S." "Such predictions help the U.S. Air Force in its war plans in Vietnam."

According to a report by a Thai newspaper, a large-scale military satellite communications center built by U.S. imperialism with an investment of more than $4 million in the central Thai province of Nakhon Pathom's Lop Buri district has been completed and has been in use since April this year.

The reactionaries' plundering in Burma has caused rice production to decline year by year. According to a report from Rangoon, the reactionary policies and plundering of the Burmese reactionary government have caused the production of Burma's main agricultural product, rice, to decline sharply year by year. The export volume of Burmese rice has been further reduced this year. The rice production in the 1966-1967 season was nearly 800,000 tons less than in the 1962-1963 season. There was a serious food shortage in Burma last year.

The export volume of Burmese rice has also been decreasing year by year. The Burmese reactionary government plans to export about 406,000 tons of rice this year, a 10% decrease from last year's export volume, and less than one-fourth of the export volume in 1963. However, this target may not be achieved.

Burma relies on rice exports to earn foreign exchange to import various industrial products, including daily necessities. Due to the sharp decrease in rice exports, Burma's foreign exchange earnings have also dropped sharply.

　　反动派危害人民利益的罪行
    美帝强征旅美的日本青年去南越当炮灰
    据新华社讯　东京消息：被英雄的越南人民打得一败涂地的美帝国主义，疯狂进行垂死挣扎，竟然把去美国旅行的日本青年强征入伍，直接派往南越战场替它充当炮灰。据日本《社会新报》八月四日揭露，一名叫田岛繁的日本公司职员，在美国旅行期间，于去年九月竟被美国当局援引它的征兵法的规定，强行把他征去当兵。经过训练，田岛已在今年七月二十四日经东京附近的横田基地被送去南越战场。田岛从横田基地打电话告诉他的公司老板，他已被美国当局征去当了美军炮兵，他在横田基地停留一个半小时后就得去南越。
    印尼法西斯军人政权加紧出卖领海权
    据新华社讯  雅加达消息：据西方通讯社报道，印尼法西斯军人政权最近颁布关于招徕外国渔业垄断资本在印尼领海进行渔业投资的“条例”，决定向一切外国渔业垄断资本家开放印尼的全部领海。“条例”规定，外国垄断资本家可以在苏拉威西、马鲁古、西伊里安、苏门答腊、加里曼丹海域捕鱼虾，在印尼的全部领海捞牡蛎和海藻。
    据安塔拉通讯社报道，到七月底止，印尼反动派已经批准六家外国渔业公司到印尼领海掠夺珍珠、小虾和各种鱼类。
    印尼法西斯军人政权出卖主权行径，给印尼国内渔业生产带来极大损害。仅北苏门答腊一个地区的渔业界每年将减少收入四百万美元。
    泰国他侬集团出卖主权让美帝大建基地
    据新华社讯　曼谷消息：据泰国报纸六日报道，他侬卖国集团的一名反动头目五日供认，泰国气象厅早就成了美帝扩大侵越战争的工具，它“经常利用气球和美国供应的仪器测验高空和太空的气候，并向美国报告。”“这种预测有助于美国空军在越南的作战计划。”
    据泰国报纸报道，美帝国主义投资四百多万美元在泰国中部万佛岁府是拉差县建立的一个大规模的军事卫星通讯中心已经建成，并且从今年四月开始使用。
    缅甸反动派的疯狂掠夺使大米连年减产
    据新华社讯　仰光消息：缅甸反动政府的反动政策和疯狂掠夺，使缅甸主要农产品大米产量逐年大幅度下降，缅甸大米的出口量今年又被迫进一步削减。一九六六—一九六七年度大米的产量比一九六二—一九六三年度下降近八十万吨。去年在缅甸发生了严重粮荒。
    缅甸大米的出口量也逐年减少。缅甸反动政府今年预计出口的大米数量约四十万零六千吨，比去年的出口量又下降了百分之十，还不到一九六三年出口量的四分之一。但是，这个指标还可能无法完成。
    缅甸是靠出口大米来换取外汇，进口包括日用品在内的各种工业品。由于大米出口锐减，缅甸外汇收入也急剧下降。
