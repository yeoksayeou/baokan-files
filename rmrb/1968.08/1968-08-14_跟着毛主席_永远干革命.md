Following Chairman Mao, Always Revolutionize

Political Commissar of the Engineering Corps of the Jinan Military Region, Old Red Army Soldier Xiong Fei

In the triumphant songs of the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the brilliant oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anyuan," which shines with the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought, has been published. From this dazzling oil painting, I saw the glorious image of our great leader Chairman Mao when he first went to Anyuan 47 years ago.

Forty-seven years ago, I was just a poor miner in the Anyuan coal mine. Today, holding this revolutionary oil painting, how can I not be moved, with my heart surging and blood boiling? As a member of the workers' patrol team before joining the army, I recall the scenes of following Chairman Mao in revolution, and there are so many heartfelt words I want to say to Chairman Mao, and so many passionate songs I want to sing for Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao, you are the reddest sun in our hearts! Following you, the miners are liberated, following you, the revolution is victorious!

For three generations, my family has worked in the Anyuan coal mine for the evil capitalists. At that time, under the oppression of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, the Anyuan miners struggled daily on the brink of starvation and cold. It was not until 1921 that a thunderous roar shook the heavens, and Chairman Mao came to Anyuan. The coal miners saw the sun.

As soon as Chairman Mao arrived in Anyuan, he went down into the low, damp mine pits, sat knee to knee with the workers, understood their hardships, spread Marxism to the workers, and called on the working class to organize, to form an iron fist, to smash the old world of man-eating, and to build a new world where the laboring people are masters. Chairman Mao came, and a red sun rose among the Anyuan miners, and in the hearts of workers and laboring people across the country. Chairman Mao came, and the 17,000-plus Anyuan miners had a guide. The working class and the broad masses of the people across the country had a guide. The revolution had a direction, and victory was guaranteed.

From 1921 to 1927, Chairman Mao came to Anyuan many more times. Chairman Mao's brilliant thought of "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" illuminated the Anyuan workers. The workers organized patrol teams, took up spears and long lances, and bravely declared war on the "three mountains." In August 1927, Chairman Mao came to Anyuan and personally ignited the flames of the Autumn Harvest Uprising, leading the Anyuan workers to participate in the uprising. From then on, the Anyuan workers embarked on the only correct path of armed seizure of power.

What I will never forget is one day in September 1930, when Chairman Mao led the Red Army to Anyuan. The next day, in front of the Anyuan miners' club, I saw with my own eyes our reddest sun! Chairman Mao was dressed in a gray military uniform, with a five-star insignia shining brightly. He stood on the platform, waving to us workers frequently, and gave a warm speech. Under the guidance of our great leader Chairman Mao, I soon joined the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army in glory, following Chairman Mao on a new journey, achieving one victory after another.

Just after Chairman Mao went to Anyuan, the Chinese Khrushchev, with evil intentions, also sneaked to Anyuan and carried out a series of treacherous acts of betraying the workers' movement. He fiercely opposed Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, pushing for "workers' welfare" in an attempt to lead the fiery political struggle onto the path of economism; he slandered armed struggle as "desperate," pushing the line of capitulationism that did not want guns; and at the most difficult time of struggle, this guy lost his nerve and ran away with his tail between his legs. However, this great traitor and great renegade had, for many years, disguised himself as the "leader of the Anyuan workers' movement," and gathered ghosts and demons to beautify him, to build monuments and write biographies, in an attempt to distort history and create counter-revolutionary public opinion to seize the party and the country. How vile and poisonous his wolf's ambitions are!

The blazing flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally ignited by our great leader Chairman Mao, have destroyed the command center of the Chinese Khrushchev's bourgeoisie, turning their restoration plots into ashes. This is the great victory of the boundless Mao Zedong Thought, and this is the great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!

The oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anyuan" depicts the great and lofty image of Chairman Mao, turning the history that had been distorted by the likes of the Chinese Khrushchev back to its original state, restoring the historical truth of Chairman Mao's personal leadership of the Anyuan miners' struggle in 1921. This is a portrait of Chairman Mao's revolutionary practice, and this is a song of praise for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The more I look at it, the more I love it, and the more strength I gain. I am determined to always be loyal to Chairman Mao, always loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and always loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. I will definitely remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "Do not rely on past merits, but strive for new achievements!" In the struggle for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I will make new contributions to the party and the people!

### 跟着毛主席　永远干革命

　　跟着毛主席　永远干革命
　　济南部队工程兵政委、老红军战士　熊飞
    在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，闪耀着毛泽东思想灿烂光辉的油画《毛主席去安源》发表了。我从这幅光彩夺目的油画中，看到了我们伟大领袖毛主席四十七年前，第一次去安源的光辉形象。
    四十七年前，我还是安源煤矿的一个穷矿工，今天我手捧革命油画，怎能不使我心潮澎湃，热血奔流。我这个参军前的工人纠察队队员，回忆起当时跟随毛主席闹革命的情景，有多少贴心的话儿要对毛主席他老人家讲，有多少热情的歌儿要给毛主席他老人家唱。毛主席啊，您是我们心中最红最红的红太阳！跟着您，矿工得解放，跟着您，革命就胜利！
    我家祖辈三代在安源煤矿给万恶的资本家做苦工。那时，在帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义三座大山的压迫下，安源矿工天天挣扎在饥寒交迫的死亡线上。直到一九二一年，霹雳一声震天响，安源来了毛主席，煤矿工人见太阳。
    毛主席一到安源就下到低矮潮湿的矿井里，和工人促膝谈心，了解工人的疾苦，向工人传播马克思主义，号召工人阶级组织起来，攥成一个铁拳头，砸烂人吃人的旧世界，建立劳动人民当家作主的新世界。毛主席来了，一轮红日在安源矿工中升起，在全国工人阶级和劳动人民心中升起。毛主席来了，一万七千多安源路矿工人有了引路人，全国的工人阶级和广大人民有了引路人。革命有了方向，胜利有了保障。
    从一九二一年到一九二七年，毛主席又多次来到安源。毛主席“枪杆子里面出政权”的光辉思想，照耀着安源工人。工人们组织纠察队，拿起梭镖、长矛，英勇地向“三座大山”宣战。一九二七年八月，毛主席来安源亲自点燃了秋收起义的烈火，并亲自率领安源工人参加了秋收暴动。从此，安源工人走上了武装夺取政权的唯一正确道路。
    最使我难忘的，是一九三○年九月的一天，毛主席率领工农红军来到安源。第二天，在安源路矿工人俱乐部门前的草坪上，我亲眼见到了我们心中最红最红的红太阳！毛主席身穿灰布军装，五星帽徽闪闪发光。他站在主席台上，频频向我们工人挥手，作了亲切的演讲。在伟大领袖毛主席的教导下，不久，我就光荣地参加了中国工农红军，跟着毛主席踏上了新的征途，取得了一个又一个的胜利。
    就在毛主席去安源不久，中国赫鲁晓夫怀着鬼胎，也溜到安源，进行了一系列叛卖工人运动的罪恶勾当。他疯狂地反对毛主席的革命路线，大搞“工人福利”，妄图把轰轰烈烈的政治斗争引向经济主义的斜路；他污蔑武装斗争是“铤而走险”，大搞不要枪杆子的投降主义路线；而在斗争最困难的时候，这个家伙失魂丧胆，夹着尾巴逃跑了。然而，就是这个大工贼大叛徒，多年以来，竟把自己装扮成“安源工运领袖”，并网罗牛鬼蛇神，为他涂脂抹粉，树碑立传，妄图颠倒历史，大造篡党篡国的反革命舆论。狼子野心，何其毒也！
    伟大领袖毛主席亲自点燃的无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火，摧毁了中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级司令部，把它的复辟阴谋化为灰烬。这是光焰无际的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，这是毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利！
    油画《毛主席去安源》，描绘了毛主席的伟大崇高形象，把被中国赫鲁晓夫之流颠倒了的历史又颠倒了过来，恢复了历史的本来面目，表现了一九二一年毛主席亲自去安源发动和领导安源路矿工人斗争的历史真实。这是一幅毛主席革命实践的写照，这是一曲毛主席革命路线的赞歌。我越看越爱看，浑身添力量。我决心永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的革命路线。一定牢记毛主席的教导：“不要吃老本，要立新功！”在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利中，为党和人民作出新的贡献！
