Xinhua News Agency, August 1st: The Ministry of National Defense held a banquet this evening at the Great Hall of the People to celebrate the 41st anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

Attendees included:

General Huang Yongsheng, Chief of the General Staff of the PLA, and Deputy Chief of the General Staff Wu Faxian;

Vice Premiers Chen Yi and Li Xiannian;

Major officials from the Ministry of National Defense and various departments of the PLA, including Su Yu, Li Zuopeng, Qiu Huizuo, Liu Xianquan, Xiao Jinguang, Wang Shusheng, Li Tianyou, Wang Xinting, Wen Yuceng, Xiao Li;

Colonel Kamara Diaby, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Guinean National People's Army, and the entire military delegation led by him, who were visiting China, were also invited to attend the banquet.

Ambassadors and military attachés from various countries also attended the banquet.

General Huang Yongsheng, Chief of the General Staff of the PLA, delivered a speech at the banquet filled with revolutionary and combative atmosphere. He said, the glorious history of our army over the past 41 years is a history of victory for the great thoughts of our Party's great leader Chairman Mao on people's war and people's army, a history of victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and a history of victory for the great helmsman Chairman Mao leading hundreds of millions of military and civilian personnel to seize and consolidate power.

He said, the Chinese People's Liberation Army is a new type of revolutionary army personally founded and led by our great helmsman Chairman Mao, directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin Biao, and nurtured by the great thought of Mao Zedong. Our great helmsman Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our army is completely for the liberation of the people and works thoroughly for the interests of the people." Over the past 41 years, under the wise leadership of our great helmsman Chairman Mao, our army, together with the people of the whole country, has overthrown the three big mountains oppressing the Chinese people, defeated domestic and foreign class enemies, and made immortal contributions to the seizure of power, the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the defense and construction of the great socialist motherland. In the struggle against American imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and the Indian reactionaries, it has made great contributions.

He said, in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our great helmsman Chairman Mao issued the great call for the PLA to be a great school and the battle order to support the broad masses of the left, entrusting our army with the glorious tasks of "three supports and two militaries." Vice Chairman Lin Biao issued the great directive to "hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," which is the greatest care and trust for our army, giving our army the greatest education and best tempering. In the fiery class struggle, the class consciousness and line struggle consciousness of the broad cadres and soldiers of our army have been raised to an unprecedented level. Unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line has become the solemn oath and conscious action of all personnel in the army. This unique army in the world has never been as strong as it is today, the relationship between the military and the people, and between the military and the government has never been as close as it is today, and our national defense has never been as solid as it is today.

He emphasized, "Navigating the vast sea relies on the helmsman, making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." Our army has what it has today, the people have what they have today, and the country has what it has today, mainly because of Mao Zedong Thought. All our victories are achieved under the leadership of Chairman Mao. Glory belongs to our great leader Chairman Mao, and glory belongs to the great Chinese people.

Huang Yongsheng talked about the current international situation, saying it is very good. He said, the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, firmly support the Vietnamese people in fighting to the end and achieving the final victory in the anti-American national salvation war; firmly support the national democratic revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America; firmly support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Europe and North America against violence; and firmly support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries in the world. He strongly condemned the American imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and Indian reactionaries, who are hurriedly forming a counter-revolutionary encirclement aimed at the People's Republic of China, frequently violating our territorial waters and airspace, and creating border tensions. Huang Yongsheng sternly warned the American imperialists and their accomplices: If you dare to impose war on us, the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will definitely break your backs! We will decisively, thoroughly, completely, and entirely annihilate your invading army!

Huang Yongsheng said in conclusion, we must heighten vigilance, strengthen preparedness, and be ready at any time to smash all provocations and incursions by the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries, and be ready at any time to liberate our territory—Taiwan!

    中国人民解放军总参谋长黄永胜同志在充满革命战斗气氛的招待会上讲话（全文见第二版）。他说，我军四十一年来的光辉历史，是我们党的伟大领袖毛主席关于人民战争和人民军队的伟大思想的胜利的历史，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的胜利史，是伟大统帅毛主席领导亿万军民夺取政权、巩固政权的胜利史。
    他说，中国人民解放军是我们的伟大统帅毛主席亲手缔造、亲自领导，林彪副主席直接指挥的，由伟大的毛泽东思想哺育成长起来的一支新型的革命军队。我们的伟大统帅毛主席教导我们：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”四十一年来，我军在伟大统帅毛主席的英明领导下，和全国人民一道，推翻了压在中国人民头上的三座大山，战胜了国内外的阶级敌人，为夺取政权，建立无产阶级专政，保卫和建设伟大的社会主义祖国，立下了不朽的功勋；在反对美帝国主义、苏联修正主义和印度反动派的斗争中，做出了巨大贡献。
    他说，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们的伟大统帅毛主席发出了“人民解放军应该是一个大学校”的伟大号召，和“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的战斗号令，赋予我军“三支”“两军”的光荣任务，林彪副主席发出了“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功”的伟大指示，这是对我军最大的关怀和最大的信任，使我军受到了最大的教育和最好的锻炼。在火热的阶级斗争中，我军广大指战员阶级觉悟和路线斗争觉悟空前提高，无限忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线，已成为全军人员的崇高誓言和自觉行动。我们这支举世无双的工农子弟兵，从来没有象今天这样的强大，军民之间、军政之间从来没有象今天这样的亲密无间，我们的国防从来没有象今天这样的巩固。
    他强调说，“大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”我们军队有今天，人民有今天，国家有今天，主要靠毛泽东思想。我们的一切胜利，都是在毛主席领导下取得的。光荣属于我们伟大领袖毛主席，光荣属于伟大的中国人民。黄永胜同志谈到当前国际形势一片大好，他说，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民和中国人民解放军，坚决支持越南人民打到底，彻底取得抗美救国战争的最后胜利；坚决支持亚、非、拉人民的民族民主革命斗争；坚决支持欧洲、北美人民的抗暴革命斗争；坚决支持世界各国人民的革命斗争。他强烈谴责美帝、苏修和印度等反动派，正在加紧拼凑旨在反对中华人民共和国的反革命包围圈，频繁地侵犯我国领海、领空，制造边境紧张局势。黄永胜同志严正警告美帝国主义及其帮凶：如果你们胆敢把战争强加在我们头上，经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的中国人民和中国人民解放军，就一定打断你们的脊梁骨！把你们的侵略军坚决、彻底、干净、全部地消灭掉！
