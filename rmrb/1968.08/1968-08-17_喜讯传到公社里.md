The red August is ablaze with fire,
In this red August, joyous events abound.
Chairman Mao has received the worker representatives,
The good news has reached our commune.

	Good news has reached our commune,
	Thousands and millions sing songs of praise—“Long live Chairman Mao!”
	The songs turn into vast waves.

	The songs turn into vast waves,
	Mountains dance and the sea rejoices.
	Chairman Mao is with us,
	A warm current of happiness surges in our hearts.

	A warm current of happiness surges in our hearts,
	The latest directives are etched in our minds.
	Under the command of Chairman Mao's headquarters,
	We fight against heaven and earth, brandishing our golden spears.

		We fight against heaven and earth, brandishing our golden spears,
		We cut off the poisonous snake of the “multi-center theory.”
		With one heart and one mind, our steps are in unison,
		We open fire on the demons and monsters.

		We will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao,
		We learn from the worker elders,
		We open fire on the demons and monsters,
		The Cultural Revolution sings a song of victory.
