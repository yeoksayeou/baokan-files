The Chinese Embassy's military attaché, Pan Gan, held a reception in Kabul on August 1 to celebrate the 41st anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

Invited to attend the reception were Afghanistan's Minister of Defense, General Khan Muhammad, Minister of Culture and Propaganda Muhammad Anas, Chief of the General Staff Gulam Faruq, Commander of the Central Corps Muhammad Isa, Commander of Air Defense Abdul Razak, and other military and political officials and figures from various sectors, totaling 200 people. The reception was held in a friendly atmosphere. The hosts and guests toasted to the continuous development of traditional friendship between the peoples of China and Afghanistan. Afghan friends congratulated the Chinese People's Liberation Army on its growing strength.

The Chinese Embassy's military attachés in India and Burma held receptions on August 1 in New Delhi and Rangoon, respectively, to celebrate the 41st anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

Some Indian social figures broke through the obstacles set up by the Indian reactionary government to attend the reception held by the military attaché of the Chinese Embassy in India, Mei Yongxi. Also in attendance were diplomatic envoys from some countries to India and students from Asian and African countries in India. The Indian reactionary government placed numerous obstacles and disruptions on the reception. On that day, it dispatched about 200 plainclothes police and agents to surround the Chinese Embassy in India, unreasonably inspecting all guests invited to attend the reception except for diplomatic personnel.

Invited to attend the reception held by the military attaché of the Chinese Embassy in Burma, Xu Zhongjiu, were officials from the Burmese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and military, diplomatic envoys from some countries to Burma, some Burmese social figures, and some representatives of the overseas Chinese community.
