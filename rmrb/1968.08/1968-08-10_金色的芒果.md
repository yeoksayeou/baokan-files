Golden mango,
Placed on a red stage,
Golden mango,
Shining with the light of the red sun.
Thousands of troops are marching towards the mango,
Thousands of songs are singing in praise of the mango.
Thousands of eyes are gazing at the mango,
Thousands of hearts are beating fiercely.
Seeing the golden mango,
It is as if seeing the great leader Chairman Mao;
Standing before the golden mango,
It is as if standing by Chairman Mao’s side.
Touching the golden mango again and again,
The golden mango is so warm!
Smelling the golden mango again and again,
The golden mango is so fragrant!
Many people hold the mango and look towards Zhongnanhai,
Happiness flows in tears;
Many people stand before the mango and make their resolutions,
Vows resound through the heavens:
“Chairman Mao!
We will forever follow you in revolution,
Until the seas dry up and the stones crumble, our hearts will not change,
No difficulties will stop us.”
“Chairman Mao!
To defend your revolutionary line,
We dare to climb the knife mountain;
To achieve the complete victory of the proletarian cultural revolution,
We dare to plunge into the sea of fire.”
“Chairman Mao!
We will definitely study your books,
Practice and apply your great thoughts,
We will definitely implement your instructions,
Not deviating by a single bit.”
……
Golden mango,
Placed on a red stage.
Golden mango,
Shining with the light of the red sun.
