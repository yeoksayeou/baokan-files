Edition: 4

	To achieve the proletarian educational revolution, we must have the working class in the lead. This is the new battle cry issued by our great leader Chairman Mao!

	Under this earth-shaking call, the entire set of reactionary fallacies propagated by feudalists, capitalists, and revisionists over thousands of years—such as “those who toil with their minds rule over others, and those who toil with their strength are ruled by others,” and “knowledge is omnipotent”—have been thoroughly exposed and defeated! The towering working class, under the guidance of our great leader Chairman Mao, is marching into schools and all domains of the superstructure! We must advance to those units where intellectuals are concentrated! What a thrilling and epoch-making great initiative this is!

	Since August 5, when our great leader Chairman Mao presented the precious gift of mangoes, sent by foreign friends, to the workers’ propaganda teams of Mao Zedong Thought in the capital, our great proletarian cultural revolution in our motherland has undergone tremendous changes in just over twenty days! Indeed, it has been a series of joyous news and victories. Basking in the sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought, we feel so blessed!

	Chairman Mao supports us, the working class, and we will make Chairman Mao proud.

	Those places where intellectuals gather, those “old difficulties” units plagued by endless “internal strife” and factionalism, have all become our battlegrounds. We must use the most thorough and revolutionary spirit of the working class to transform these places. The working class must lead everything and is capable of leading everything! Those bourgeois masters, those “spiritual aristocrats” who flaunt the banner of “those who toil with their minds rule over others” and look down upon workers and peasants, we, the working class, are going to give you a taste of our might! The phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools can no longer continue, and the phenomenon of bourgeois masters ruling certain parts of our superstructure can no longer continue! Places where intellectuals gather are often the strongholds of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, becoming “independent kingdoms” where even a needle cannot be inserted or water cannot be splashed. We, the working class, must march in and bring Chairman Mao’s latest instructions there, ensuring that the great Mao Zedong Thought takes root forever and transforms these places into vibrant schools of Mao Zedong Thought.

	We will not disappoint the trust and expectations of our great leader Chairman Mao. We will fully mobilize the masses, summarize experiences in a timely manner, conduct investigations and research, study and apply Chairman Mao’s works, and continuously raise our political consciousness through struggle. We will surely accomplish every battle task assigned by Chairman Mao with outstanding results and report our victories to Chairman Mao!

专栏：革命群众来信

    开到知识分子成堆的地方去！编辑同志：
    “实现无产阶级教育革命，必须有工人阶级领导”，伟大领袖毛主席向我们发出了新的战斗号令！
    在这震天动地的号令声中，几千年来封建主义、资本主义和修正主义分子一再鼓吹的“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”、“知识万能”等一整套反动的歪论邪说，彻底地破产了！顶天立地的工人阶级，在伟大领袖毛主席的指引下，要进入学校和上层建筑的各个领域中去！要开到那些知识分子成堆的单位里去！这是一个何等激动人心的划时代的伟大创举啊！
    自从八月五日，伟大领袖毛主席把外国朋友赠送给他老人家的珍贵礼品芒果转送给首都工人毛泽东思想宣传队以来，在短短二十多天中，我们伟大祖国的无产阶级文化大革命，发生了多么巨大的变化啊！真是喜讯连喜讯，捷报连捷报。沐浴在毛泽东思想的阳光下，是多么的幸福啊！
    毛主席给我们工人阶级撑腰，我们为毛主席争气。
    那些知识分子成堆的地方，那些“内战”不休，山头林立的“老大难”单位，统统成了我们工人阶级的战场。我们一定要用工人阶级最彻底、最革命的精神，把这些地方改造好。我们工人阶级必须领导一切，而且能够领导一切！那些资产阶级的老爷们，那些打着“劳心者治人”招牌，轻视工农的“精神贵族”们，你们的老虎屁股我们工人阶级要来摸一摸了！“资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了”，资产阶级老爷们统治我们的某些上层建筑的现象，再也不能继续下去了！知识分子成堆的地方，往往是中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义路线统治最顽固的地方，成为针插不进、水泼不进的“独立王国”。我们工人阶级一定要开进去，把毛主席的最新指示带到那里去，让伟大的毛泽东思想永远在那里扎根，把这些地方变成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    我们决不辜负伟大领袖毛主席的信任和期望。我们一定要充分发动群众，及时总结经验，做好调查研究，活学活用毛主席著作，在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟，胜利完成毛主席交给我们的每一项战斗任务，以出色的成绩向毛主席他老人家报喜！
