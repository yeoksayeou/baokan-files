To commemorate the second anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's historic big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters," our newspaper invited representatives from Beijing's workers and the People's Liberation Army to hold a symposium.

Our newspaper reports: To commemorate the second anniversary of the publication of the big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters" by our great leader Chairman Mao, our newspaper invited representatives from Beijing's workers and the People's Liberation Army to hold a symposium. At the meeting, everyone enthusiastically pointed out that the publication of "Bombard the Headquarters" sounded the charge for the advance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, pointed out the main direction of struggle for the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses, provided a powerful ideological weapon, and solved the most fundamental problem of how to prevent the restoration of capitalism. Everyone unanimously agreed that we must be even more infinitely loyal to the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, more steadfastly follow every strategic deployment of the proletarian headquarters, better study and apply Chairman Mao Zedong Thought, criticize the reactionary "multi-center theory," and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. This is the best way to commemorate the second anniversary of the publication of the big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters."

"The 'Bombard the Headquarters' Big-Character Poster Sounds the Charge for the Great Advance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution"

High Mingqi, Worker of Beijing First Machine Tool Factory

At this moment of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, reviewing Chairman Mao's big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters" and recalling the two-year battle course, we feel particularly close and our hearts are extremely moved. It was this big-character poster by Chairman Mao that sounded the charge for the great advance toward the capitalist headquarters, sentenced the capitalist headquarters to death. Under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses across the country launched a fierce attack on the capitalist headquarters, shattered the dream of restoring capitalism by the Chinese Khrushchev, exposed his agents in various regions and departments, captured one after another of their reactionary fortresses, and seized back the party, government, financial, and cultural powers that they had usurped.

Our factory is one of the key enterprises in Beijing's industrial sector. In the past, the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee's counter-revolutionary revisionist clique, in collusion with a handful of unrepentant capitalist-roaders within the factory, vigorously promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of managing enterprises advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev, fiercely resisted the proletarian revolutionary line of our great leader Chairman Mao. For more than a decade, this handful of traitors, spies, and unrepentant capitalist-roaders have always been the loyal agents of the capitalist headquarters in our factory. Chairman Mao's big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters" provided a powerful ideological weapon for the broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses in our factory. Everyone's backbone is stronger, the direction is clearer, breaking through the white terror of the capitalist reactionary line, and resolutely fighting against this handful of capitalist-roaders, seizing back the party, government, financial, and cultural powers they had usurped in our factory. From this, it can be fully seen that Chairman Mao's big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters" has shown tremendous power. This is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

Chen Yucai, Deputy Director of the Revolutionary Committee of Beijing Knitting General Factory

Chairman Mao's big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters" is a great battle program for the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses to attack the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party headed by the Chinese Khrushchev. It sentences the capitalist headquarters to death. Every time we study this big-character poster, our hearts are extremely moved.

Our knitting general factory was originally a reactionary stronghold where the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the textile system. At the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the factory faithfully executed the black directives of the Chinese Khrushchev and the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee, using production to suppress the revolution and diverting the focus of struggle. After the work team entered the factory, they colluded with the old party committee to vigorously promote the capitalist reactionary line, besieging the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. Just when the broad revolutionary masses were suppressed and persecuted, the great leader Chairman Mao's big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters" and the "Sixteen Points" were successively published. We, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses, repelled the capitalist reactionary line and the repeated counterattacks of the capitalist-roaders within the factory, seizing power from the capitalist-roaders within the factory. Since then, this stronghold that promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist line has been transformed into a socialist factory advancing along the track of Mao Zedong Thought.

This year, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, we have deeply carried out revolutionary criticism and criticism, seriously carried out the work of cleaning up the class ranks, politically and ideologically eliminating the poison of the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionism, and organizationally eliminating traitors, spies, and all counter-revolutionary elements sheltered by the Chinese Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, achieving great victories in both the revolutionary and production fronts. At this moment of commemorating the second anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters," we are determined to thoroughly eliminate the poison of the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line in all fields, allowing the great Mao Zedong Thought to command everything, ensuring that our great socialist motherland will remain red forever.

Wang Yongquan, Beijing Troops

The great leader Chairman Mao's big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters" is a declaration and mobilization order for the proletarian headquarters to launch a comprehensive counterattack against the capitalist headquarters. It calls on the broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses to launch a fierce attack on the capitalist headquarters headed by the Chinese Khrushchev. We, the People's Liberation Army of China, are the most loyal to Chairman Mao. After Chairman Mao issued the brilliant directive that "the People's Liberation Army should support the broad leftist masses," we acted swiftly, rushing to the front lines of "three supports and two militaries," firmly supporting the broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses, fighting against the capitalist headquarters and their agents in various regions to seize power. We actively promoted the establishment of revolutionary committees, enthusiastically helped them to consolidate and develop continuously, and resolutely struck down all class enemies who dared to sabotage the revolutionary committees, making the dream of restoring capitalism by the Chinese Khrushchev and his capitalist headquarters completely shattered.

On this day of commemorating the second anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters," we, the People's Liberation Army, must better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow the strategic deployments of the proletarian headquarters, strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, strengthen the struggle against the enemy, deeply and persistently carry out revolutionary criticism and criticism, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

"Firmly Follow Every Strategic Deployment of the Proletarian Headquarters, Thoroughly Criticize the Reactionary 'Multi-Center Theory'"

Chen Yunqi, Member of the Revolutionary Committee of Beijing New China Printing Factory

In the past two years, under the call of Chairman Mao's big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters," we, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses, have become even more fond of the proletarian headquarters, more loyal to the proletarian headquarters, and more steadfastly followed every strategic deployment of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin.

On the eve of July 1st this year, our factory was entrusted with a most glorious task: to print a large number of color oil paintings of "Chairman Mao Goes to Anyuan" to celebrate the party's birthday. After the news was announced, the printers tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, with hearts full of boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, overcame various difficulties and successfully completed this glorious and arduous political task, allowing the glorious image of Chairman Mao in his youth to be seen by the people of the whole country in time, greatly inspiring the revolutionary spirit of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses.

We deeply feel that at this crucial moment of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we need to be even more infinitely loyal to the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. In our hearts, there can only be one center, and that is the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and there cannot be a second center. Recently, we organized a workers' propaganda team for Mao Zedong Thought to propagate Chairman Mao's latest directives. In the propaganda, we found that a few people in some units and departments were influenced by the reactionary theory of "multi-centerism," did not seriously study Mao Zedong Thought, did not resolutely implement Chairman Mao's latest directives, and deviated from Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments. We must criticize the erroneous idea of "me-centeredness," strengthen the concept of proletarian unity, use Mao Zedong Thought to transform our bourgeois worldview, and cultivate ourselves into revolutionary masses of the proletariat who are infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao. Under the command of the proletarian headquarters, we will unite our will, unite our steps, and unite our actions to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Zhang Wen, Worker of Beijing Knitting General Factory

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the great leader Chairman Mao called on us to care about state affairs and rebel against the capitalist-roaders. However, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the knitting general factory distorted right and wrong, confused black and white, suppressed different opinions, and implemented white terror, labeling a large number of revolutionary masses who loved Chairman Mao and the party as "counter-revolutionaries." I was also a victim. It was the big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters" by our great leader Chairman Mao that liberated us from the white terror of the capitalist reactionary line.

Chairman Mao's big-character poster shattered the sinister plot of the Chinese Khrushchev to restore capitalism and ignited the blazing fire to destroy the capitalist headquarters! With the great teacher Chairman Mao backing us, we, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, fear nothing, no matter how strong the enemy, and can capture any stubborn fortresses.

Under the inspiration of Chairman Mao's big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters," we, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses in the knitting general factory, broke out of the white terror, rebelled against the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, and seized power from the capitalist-roaders within the factory. Immediately afterwards, with the help of the soldiers of the 8341st Unit of the People's Liberation Army sent by Chairman Mao, we achieved revolutionary great unity and established a revolutionary committee with three-in-one combination, truly becoming the masters of the factory.

Because we closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, deeply carried out revolutionary criticism and criticism, and deeply carried out class struggle, the revolutionary and production situation in our factory has been getting better and better, and the revolutionary consciousness of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat has been unprecedentedly heightened. All rivers and streams flow into the sea. At this moment of commemorating the second anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters," we sing loudly a thousand times and ten thousand times: "The party's favor is greater than the heavens and the earth, parents' love is not as great as Chairman Mao's love!" In the future, we must more consciously follow the great leader Chairman Mao, more resolutely act according to Chairman Mao's directives, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Fu Jinduan, Commander of the Sea Tiger Boat

"The Communist Party of China is the core leadership of the entire Chinese people. Without such a core, the cause of socialism cannot be victorious." Reading Chairman Mao's great teaching, I feel particularly close. The proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin is our only leadership center, and there cannot be a second center. All the hundreds of millions of military and civilian people across the country must closely unite around this leadership center.

The so-called "multi-center theory" is a reactionary theory of bourgeois factionalism and individualism. We must thoroughly criticize this "multi-center theory." It interferes with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments and obstructs the victorious development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must strengthen the concept of proletarian unity, strengthen the organizational discipline of the proletarian revolution, and forever unite under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow the great leader Chairman Mao, closely follow every strategic deployment of the proletarian headquarters, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

"Study and Apply Mao Zedong Thought, Study and Apply in Unity, and Carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution Through to the End"

Hou Guirong, Deputy Director of the Revolutionary Committee of Beijing First Machine Tool Factory

Every victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our factory is the result of the broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat in our factory studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments. Vice Commander Lin instructed us: "Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all work of the entire party, the entire army, and the entire country." In the past two years, we have insisted on studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the struggle, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, and firmly grasping the direction of the struggle. When Chairman Mao's latest directive "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to necessarily split into two major factions" was issued, we conveyed it immediately and implemented it resolutely, quickly achieving revolutionary great unity. When Chairman Mao's directive "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is essentially a political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and its led broad revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie" was issued, we, with the help of the stationed soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, promptly held Mao Zedong Thought study classes, repeatedly studied, and quickly implemented it. In implementing this latest directive of Chairman Mao, we combined the cleaning up of class ranks with the carrying out of revolutionary criticism and criticism, not only exposing a handful of deeply hidden traitors, spies, and unrepentant capitalist-roaders, consolidating the great achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution organizationally, but also washing away the feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism mud and dirt spread by the Chinese Khrushchev and the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee's counter-revolutionary revisionist clique in the factory ideologically and politically, consolidating and developing the newly born revolutionary committee.

Because we insisted on studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the struggle, we greatly promoted the thought revolutionization of the people. The broad revolutionary workers in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have shown unprecedented enthusiasm, driving the great development of production. The production volume in the second quarter of this year has increased significantly compared to the first quarter, and July created a new record in the history of our factory.

The practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the past two years vividly illustrates: Insisting on Mao Zedong Thought as the banner, the struggle will be victorious; deviating from the track of Mao Zedong Thought, the revolution will fail. In the future, we must better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, unite together, overcome all non-proletarian thoughts in our minds, and resolutely fight against the reactionary theory of "multi-centerism," closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, and turn the First Machine Tool Factory into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.

Fu Jinduan, Commander of the Sea Tiger Boat

Whether one can apply what one has learned from Mao Zedong Thought is an important sign of whether one is loyal to the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. If one can work hard on the application of what one has learned from Mao Zedong Thought, it is the greatest loyalty to Chairman Mao, and one can overcome all difficulties and defeat all seemingly powerful enemies.

On November 14, 1965, the U.S.-made Kuomintang ships "Yongchang" and "Yongtai" intruded into our fishing grounds, causing trouble and destruction. That day, it was both windy and rainy. In accordance with Vice Commander Lin's instruction to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, the party branch immediately organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's teaching on "this army has the spirit of advancing without fear of sacrifice," and carried forward the great revolutionary spirit of the proletarian warriors, engaging in a fierce battle with the enemy. Facing the enemy's large ships, how could our small boats defeat the enemy? After studying Chairman Mao's teachings on "strategically, we must despise all enemies, tactically, we must take all enemies seriously" and "all reactionaries are paper tigers," we were fearless, quickly approaching the enemy ships to within a hundred meters, engaging in close combat with the enemy. Using our strengths to overcome the enemy's weaknesses, we fought the enemy into confusion, with some screaming and others jumping into the sea. In an instant, the U.S.-made Kuomintang ship "Yongchang," which was nearly ten times larger than our boat, was sunk to the bottom of the sea, feeding the fish. The "Yongchang's" brother ship "Yongtai" was also hit and fled in disarray.

Iron facts prove: Revolutionary warriors armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest fighting force. Those who study and apply Mao Zedong Thought well in peacetime will certainly stand firm in battles and at critical moments of life and death. On the contrary, if one does not study Chairman Mao's works well, saying one thing and doing another, one will deviate from the track of Mao Zedong Thought and go astray. At present, we must study and apply Chairman Mao's series of extremely important latest directives on the Cultural Revolution well, keeping up with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments.

Ke Yueying, Worker of New China Printing Factory

We, the printers, the propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought on the printing front, are particularly diligent in studying Mao Zedong Thought and particularly serious in executing Chairman Mao's latest directives, following the call of the proletarian headquarters.

Recently, we accepted the task of printing the oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anyuan," which we completed through studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and carrying out revolutionary criticism and criticism. When we accepted this extremely honorable political task, everyone was overjoyed, spreading the news, and made a vow: "Loyalty is shown in action. We will command the battle with Mao Zedong Thought."

This printing task was urgent, time was tight, and the quality requirements were high. To allow the people of the whole country to see the oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anyuan" as soon as possible, we first studied Mao Zedong Thought, criticizing the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents within the factory who had long resisted and opposed the printing of Chairman Mao's works and portraits. The more we criticized, the more we hated the Chinese Khrushchev and the more we loved the great leader Chairman Mao, determined to complete the task with the fastest speed and the best quality, reporting to the great leader Chairman Mao. Before the Cultural Revolution, due to the obstruction of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in our factory, most of the machines could not be used to print the portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao. But this time, to give the Chinese Khrushchev a resounding slap in the face, we broke through the old frameworks, creating the method of "flow production" color matching with multiple machines. The work that used to take more than a month was completed in just three days and nights.

At this moment of commemorating the second anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters," we must more seriously study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, especially seriously study and apply Chairman Mao's series of important latest directives on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    毛主席的具有划时代意义的大字报《炮打司令部》
　　宣判了隐藏在我们党内的资产阶级司令部的死刑
　　为纪念《炮打司令部》大字报发表两周年，本报邀请首都部分工人和解放军代表举行座谈
    本报讯　为了纪念我们伟大领袖毛主席的大字报——《炮打司令部》发表两周年，本报邀请首都部分工人和解放军的代表，举行座谈会。会上，大家热情洋溢地指出，《炮打司令部》大字报的发表，吹响了无产阶级文化大革命的进军号角，为无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众指明了斗争的主攻方向，提供了强大的思想武器，解决了如何防止资本主义复辟的最根本的问题。大家一致认为，必须更加无限忠于以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，更加坚定不移地紧跟无产阶级司令部的每一个战略部署，更好地活学活用毛泽东思想，批判反动的“多中心论”，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，这才是对《炮打司令部》大字报发表两周年的最好的纪念。
    《炮打司令部》大字报吹响了无产阶级文化大革命大进军的号角
    北京第一机床厂工人　高明启
    在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的时刻，重温毛主席《炮打司令部》的大字报，回顾两年来的战斗历程，我们感到特别亲切，心情非常激动。是毛主席的这张大字报，吹响了向资产阶级司令部大进军的号角，宣判了资产阶级司令部的死刑。全国无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的领导下，向资产阶级司令部发动了猛烈的进攻，打碎了中国赫鲁晓夫的复辟资本主义的美梦，揪出了他们在各地区、各部门的代理人，攻克了他们所盘踞的一个个的反动堡垒，夺回了被他们篡夺的那部分党、政、财、文大权。
    我厂是北京市工业战线的重点企业之一。过去，旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团，和厂内一小撮死不改悔的走资派串通一气，在我厂大肆推行中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义办企业的路线，疯狂抵制伟大领袖毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。十几年来，这一小撮叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派，一直是资产阶级司令部在我厂的忠实代理人。毛主席《炮打司令部》的大字报，为我厂广大无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众提供了强大的思想武器。大家的腰杆更硬了，方向更明了，冲破了资产阶级反动路线的白色恐怖，和一小撮走资派作了坚决的斗争，夺回了他们在我厂窃取的党、政、财、文大权。从这里可以充分看到，毛主席《炮打司令部》的大字报，显示出了巨大威力。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    北京针织总厂革命委员会副主任　程育才
    毛主席《炮打司令部》的大字报，是无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，向以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资派进攻的伟大战斗纲领，它宣判了资产阶级司令部的死刑。每当我们学习这张大字报时，心情都异常激动。
    我们针织总厂，原来是旧北京市委在纺织系统推行反革命修正主义路线的一个反动堡垒。文化大革命刚开始时，厂内一小撮走资派忠实地执行了中国赫鲁晓夫和旧北京市委的黑指示，以生产压革命，转移斗争目标。工作组进厂以后，又和旧党委串通一气，大搞资产阶级反动路线，围剿无产阶级革命派。正当广大革命群众受压抑、被迫害的时候，伟大领袖毛主席《炮打司令部》的大字报和“十六条”先后公布了，我们无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，打退了资产阶级反动路线和厂内走资派一次次的反扑，夺了厂内走资派的权。从此，把这一推行反革命修正主义路线的据点，变为沿着毛泽东思想轨道前进的社会主义工厂。
    今年，我们在毛泽东思想的指引下，深入开展革命大批判，认真地作好清理阶级队伍的工作，从政治上、思想上肃清中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义的毒害，从组织上清除中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派包庇下的叛徒、特务及一切反革命分子，使我们在革命和生产两条战线上取得了巨大胜利。在纪念毛主席《炮打司令部》的大字报发表两周年的时候，我们决心要在各个领域彻底清除中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义路线的毒害，让伟大的毛泽东思想统帅一切，保证我们伟大的社会主义祖国千秋万代永不变色。
    北京部队　王永泉
    伟大领袖毛主席《炮打司令部》的大字报，是无产阶级司令部向资产阶级司令部发起全面反击的宣言书和动员令。它号召广大无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，向以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部发起猛烈的进攻。我们中国人民解放军，最忠于毛主席。毛主席他老人家发出“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的光辉指示以后，我们闻风而动，纷纷奔赴“三支”“两军”第一线，坚决支持广大无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，向资产阶级司令部和他们在各地区的代理人进行夺权斗争。我们积极促进革命委员会的建立，热情帮助她不断地巩固和发展，坚决打击一切胆敢破坏革委会的阶级敌人，使中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部复辟资本主义的黄粱美梦彻底破产了。
    在纪念毛主席《炮打司令部》的大字报发表两周年的日子里，我们解放军一定要更好地活学活用毛泽东思想，紧跟无产阶级司令部的战略部署，加强无产阶级专政，加强对敌斗争，深入持久地开展革命大批判，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    坚定不移地紧跟无产阶级司令部每一个战略部署，彻底批判反动的“多中心论”
    北京新华印刷厂革命委员会委员　陈运起
    两年来，在毛主席《炮打司令部》大字报的召唤下，我们无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，更加热爱无产阶级司令部，更加忠于无产阶级司令部，更加坚定不移地紧跟以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的每一个战略部署。
    今年“七一”前夕，我厂要完成一项最光荣的任务，赶印大量的《毛主席去安源》彩色油画，向党的生日献礼。喜讯传出后，经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的印刷工人，凭着颗颗对伟大领袖毛主席无限忠诚的红心，排除了各种困难，圆满地完成了这项光荣而艰巨的政治任务，使伟大领袖毛主席青年时代的光辉形象及时地和全国人民见了面，极大地鼓舞了无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众的革命斗志。
    我们深切地体会到，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的关键时刻，更加需要我们对以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的无限忠诚。在我们的心坎里，只能有一个中心，这就是以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，不能有第二个中心。最近我们组织了工人毛泽东思想宣传队，宣传毛主席最新指示。在宣传中，我们发现，有些单位和部门的极少数人，受到“多中心论”这一反动理论的影响，没有认真学习毛泽东思想，不坚决贯彻毛主席最新指示，离开了毛主席的伟大战略部署。我们必须批判“以我为中心”的错误思想，加强无产阶级的整体观念，用毛泽东思想改造自己的资产阶级世界观，把自己培养成为无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的无产阶级革命派。在无产阶级司令部的号令下，统一意志，统一步伐，统一行动，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    北京针织总厂工人　张　雯
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，伟大领袖毛主席号召我们要关心国家大事，造走资派的反。可是，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在针织总厂的代理人，却颠倒是非，混淆黑白，压制不同意见，实行白色恐怖，把大批热爱毛主席、热爱党的革命群众打成了“反革命”，我也是一个受害者。是我们伟大领袖毛主席《炮打司令部》大字报的一声炮响，把我们从资产阶级反动路线的白色恐怖中解放了出来。
    毛主席的大字报粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋，点燃了毁灭资产阶级司令部的熊熊烈火！伟大导师毛主席给我们撑腰，我们无产阶级革命派就什么都不怕，什么强敌都不在话下，什么顽固堡垒也能攻下。
    在毛主席《炮打司令部》大字报的鼓舞下，我们针织总厂无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众从白色恐怖中冲杀出来，造了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的反，夺了厂内走资派的权。紧接着，又在毛主席派来的八三四一部队解放军同志的帮助下，实现了革命的大联合，建立了三结合的革命委员会，使我们真正做了工厂的主人。
    由于紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，深入开展革命的大批判，深入开展阶级斗争，我们厂的革命和生产形势越来越好，我们无产阶级革命派的革命觉悟空前提高。百流千川归大海。在纪念毛主席《炮打司令部》大字报发表两周年的时刻，我们千遍万遍地高声歌唱：“天大地大不如党的恩情大，爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲！”今后，我们一定要更加自觉地紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，更加坚决地照毛主席的指示办事，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    海上猛虎艇艇长　傅金泉
    “中国共产党是全中国人民的领导核心。没有这样一个核心，社会主义事业就不能胜利。”读了毛主席这一伟大教导，感到格外亲切。以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，是我们唯一的领导中心，不能有第二个中心。我们全国亿万军民，都要紧紧地团结在这个领导中心的周围。
    所谓“多中心论”，是资产阶级山头主义、个人主义的反动理论。我们必须彻底批判这种“多中心论”。它干扰毛主席的伟大战略部署，阻碍无产阶级文化大革命的胜利发展。我们要加强无产阶级的整体观念，加强无产阶级革命的组织纪律性，永远团结在毛泽东思想的旗帜下，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，紧跟无产阶级司令部的每一个战略部署，将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    活学活用毛泽东思想，学用一致，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底
    北京第一机床厂革命委员会副主任　侯桂荣
    我厂无产阶级文化大革命的每一步胜利，都是我厂广大无产阶级革命派活学活用毛泽东思想，紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署的结果。林副统帅指示我们：
  “毛泽东思想是全党、全军和全国一切工作的指导方针。”两年来，我们在斗争中坚持活学活用毛泽东思想，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握斗争的大方向。当毛主席的最新指示“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织”发出后，我们连夜传达，坚决贯彻，很快实现了革命大联合。当毛主席“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续”的指示发出后，我们又在驻厂解放军的帮助下，及时举办了毛泽东思想学习班，反复学习，迅速落实。在贯彻毛主席这一最新指示中，我们把清理阶级队伍和开展革命大批判结合起来，不但揪出一小撮隐藏很深的叛徒、特务和顽固不化的走资派，从组织上巩固了无产阶级文化大革命的伟大成果，而且从思想上、政治上和理论上冲刷了中国赫鲁晓夫和旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团散布在厂内的封建主义、资本主义和修正主义的污泥浊水，巩固和发展了新生的革命委员会。
    由于我们在斗争中坚持活学活用毛泽东思想，大大促进了人的思想革命化。广大革命职工在无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出的冲天干劲，推动了生产的大发展。今年第二季度的生产量，比第一季度有较大幅度的增长，七月份又创造了我厂历史上的最高纪录。
    两年来无产阶级文化大革命的实践生动地说明：坚持毛泽东思想挂帅，斗争就能胜利，偏离了毛泽东思想的轨道，革命就要失败。今后，我们要更好地活学活用毛泽东思想，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部领导下，团结起来，克服自己头脑里的一切非无产阶级思想，与“多中心论”的反动理论作坚决斗争，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，把第一机床厂办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    海上猛虎艇艇长　傅金泉
    学了毛泽东思想，能不能用，这是衡量我们每个革命战士忠于不忠于以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的重要标志。学了毛泽东思想，能在用字上狠下功夫，就是对毛主席最大的忠，就能克服一切困难，战胜一切貌似强大的敌人。
    一九六五年十一月十四日，美制蒋舰“永昌号”和“永泰号”，窜犯我渔场，骚扰破坏。那天又是刮风，又是下雨。遵照林副主席对毛泽东思想要活学活用的指示，党支部立即组织大家学习毛主席关于“这个军队具有一往无前的精神”的教导，发扬无产阶级战士大无畏的革命精神，和敌人展开了激战。面对着敌人的大舰，我们小艇如何消灭敌人呢？我们学习了毛主席“在战略上我们要藐视一切敌人，在战术上我们要重视一切敌人”和“一切反动派都是纸老虎”的教导后，浑身是胆，以最快的速度，把小艇开到离敌舰只有百十米远的地方，和敌人展开短兵相接的战斗。以我之长，克敌之短，打得敌人晕头转向，嚎叫的嚎叫，跳海的跳海。转眼之间，比我艇大近十倍的美制蒋舰“永昌号”，被我们击沉海底，喂鱼虾去了。“永昌号”的狗兄弟“永泰号”，也被我们击伤，狼狈逃窜。
    铁的事实证明：用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士是最大的战斗力。平时活学活用毛泽东思想好的人，必然在战斗中，在生死的紧要关头过得硬。反过来，如果不好好学习毛主席著作，说的是一套，做的是一套，就会脱离毛泽东思想的轨道，走到邪路上去。当前，我们一定要学好用好毛主席关于文化大革命一系列极其重要的最新指示，跟上毛主席的伟大战略部署。

    我们印刷工人，印刷战线上的毛泽东思想宣传兵，对学习毛泽东思想特别努力，对执行毛主席最新指示特别认真，一切听从无产阶级司令部的召唤。
    我们最近接受印制《毛主席去安源》油画，就是通过活学活用毛泽东思想和革命大批判才完成的。当我们接受这项极其光荣的政治任务后，大家喜出望外，奔走相告，并且立下了誓言：“忠不忠，看行动。我们要用毛泽东思想指挥战斗。”
    这次印制，任务急，时间紧，质量要求高。为了让全国人民能早日看到《毛主席去安源》这幅油画，我们首先学习毛泽东思想，批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其在厂内的代理人长期抵制、反对印制毛主席著作和毛主席画像的滔天罪行。大家越批，对中国赫鲁晓夫越恨，对伟大领袖毛主席越爱，决心要以最快的速度、最好的质量，向伟大领袖毛主席汇报。在文化大革命前，由于中国赫鲁晓夫及其在我厂的代理人的阻挠，大部分机器不能用来印制我们伟大领袖毛主席的像。但这次，为了狠狠地给中国赫鲁晓夫一记响亮耳光，我们打破过去的旧框框，创造了多台机器“流水作业”套色的方法。过去需要一个多月才能完成的工作量，现在只花了三昼夜时间就完成了。
    在纪念毛主席《炮打司令部》大字报发表两周年的时候，我们一定要更加认真地活学活用毛泽东思想，特别是认真地学好用好毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的一系列重要的最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
