The great leader Chairman Mao personally directed the formulation of the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China Concerning the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," which is a brilliant historical document mobilizing the hundreds of millions of revolutionary people of the whole country to smash the bourgeois headquarters. Over the past two years, our broad ranks of cadres and fighters have deeply felt that the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin represents the interests of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses most concentratedly. The fundamental principle of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is to believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and respect and give full play to the initiative of the revolutionary masses. Therefore, only by standing together with the broad revolutionary masses and launching a fierce attack on the handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party headed by China's Khrushchev can we achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Last July, our company responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "support the leftist broad masses" and went to Nanjing to carry out the "three supports and two militaries" task. At that time, this place was at a critical moment of fierce struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads. China's Khrushchev and his agents in Jiangsu, Jiang Weiqing and Chen Guang, in order to protect themselves and restore capitalism, fiercely opposed the "Sixteen Points" personally directed by Chairman Mao and crazily pushed a bourgeois reactionary line to suppress the broad revolutionary masses. Meanwhile, those traitors, spies, and all other ghosts and snakes hiding in the gutters all crawled out, stirring up contradictions between the two revolutionary mass factions to achieve their evil goal of sabotaging the Cultural Revolution. In this complicated class struggle, our company went to 23 units to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, propagating Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. After receiving the task, we immediately organized everyone to seriously study the "Sixteen Points." Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must trust the masses, rely on the masses, and respect the masses' initiative. We must mobilize the masses to revolutionize, educate, manage, and liberate themselves." Chairman Mao's words, like a red sun, illuminated our hearts and pointed out the direction for us. Everyone realized that the masses are the real heroes, and the masses are the main force of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In the past, we followed Chairman Mao's teachings, believed in and relied on the masses, and defeated the enemy with guns; today, we still need to believe in and rely on the masses to defeat the enemy without guns. As long as we act according to the "Sixteen Points," believe in and rely on the masses, we can overcome all class enemies and achieve a great victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Later, we went to factories, schools, shops, offices, and residential areas to get close to the masses and held 245 Mao Zedong Thought study classes, propagating Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions to the hearts of the broad revolutionary masses. Squad leader Ni Jincheng and a few soldiers went to the Jiangsu New China Printing Plant to hold a study class. This factory, in the past, did not print Chairman Mao's works but printed a large number of feudal and capitalist publications, creating counter-revolutionary public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. During the Cultural Revolution, the class enemies attempted to use the contradictions between the two revolutionary mass organizations to not print Chairman Mao's works but to print materials of the bourgeois factionalism. Facing this situation, squad leader Ni Jincheng, under the guidance of the "Sixteen Points," closely relied on the broad revolutionary masses in the factory, focused on class education, organized soldiers and revolutionary masses in the factory to brave the rain to the Rain Flower Terrace to mourn the revolutionary martyrs, and seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions on achieving revolutionary great unity at the martyrs' tomb, exposing China's Khrushchev's heinous crimes of opposing the broad revolutionary people's active study and application of Chairman Mao's works, as well as the class enemies' conspiracy to sabotage the unity of revolutionary masses. The broad revolutionary masses further strengthened their boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, eagerly demanding the full implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and thoroughly carrying out the revolution. In this way, the masses urged the leaders, and the leaders moved the mountains, and the two revolutionary mass factions soon achieved revolutionary great unity and quickly established the revolutionary committee. Under the leadership of the revolutionary committee, the broad revolutionary masses carried out a thorough revolutionary criticism, followed the clues to expose a handful of class enemies, and launched a high tide of grabbing the revolution and promoting production.

The two years of struggle practice have made us deeply realize that the "Sixteen Points" personally directed by Chairman Mao is the beacon to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must resolutely act according to the "Sixteen Points," unshakably believe in and rely on the masses, closely unite around the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, strengthen the struggle against the enemy, deeply and persistently carry out revolutionary criticism, do a good job in cleaning up the class ranks, thoroughly eliminate the poison of China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, and do a good job in struggle, criticism, and transformation to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

　　坚决执行毛主席战斗号令相信和依靠群众就是胜利
　　南京部队某部政治指导员　周先伦
    我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的《中国共产党中央委员会关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》，是一篇动员全国亿万革命人民摧毁资产阶级司令部的光辉历史文献。两年来，我们广大指战员深深体会到，以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，最集中地代表了无产阶级和广大革命人民群众的利益。毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，最根本一条，就是相信群众，依靠群众，尊重和发挥革命群众的首创精神。因此，只有和广大革命人民群众站在一起，向以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派发动猛烈的进攻，才能夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    去年七月，我们连响应毛主席“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号召，到南京执行“三支”“两军”任务。当时，这里正是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线激烈搏斗的关键时刻，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在江苏的代理人江渭清、陈光之流，为了保护自己，复辟资本主义，就拚命地对抗毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”，疯狂地推行一条镇压广大革命群众的资产阶级反动路线，而那些躲藏在阴沟里的叛徒、特务和其他一切牛鬼蛇神也纷纷爬出来，挑动两派革命群众之间的矛盾，以实现他们破坏文化大革命的罪恶目的。在这种错综复杂的阶级斗争情况下，我们连到二十三个单位大办毛泽东思想学习班，宣传毛主席的一系列最新指示。我们接受任务后，立即组织大家认真学习“十六条”。毛主席教导我们：“要信任群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神。要放手发动群众，让群众自己起来革命，自己教育自己，自己管理自己，自己解放自己。”毛主席的话，象一轮红日照亮了我们的心，给我们指明了方向。大家认识到，群众是真正的英雄，群众是无产阶级文化大革命的主力军。过去，我们遵循毛主席的教导，相信和依靠群众，打败了拿枪的敌人；今天，我们仍然要相信和依靠群众，打败不拿枪的敌人。只要我们按照“十六条”办事，相信和依靠群众，就能战胜一切阶级敌人，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利。
    以后，我们纷纷下到工厂、学校、商店、机关和居民区，深入群众，先后办起二百四十五个毛泽东思想学习班，把毛主席一系列的最新指示宣传到广大革命群众的心坎里。四班长倪金成和几个战士到江苏新华印刷厂办学习班。这个厂，过去不印毛主席著作，却印了大量封建主义和资本主义的读物，为复辟资本主义大造反革命舆论。在文化大革命中，阶级敌人又妄图利用两派革命群众组织之间的矛盾，不印毛主席著作，却印资产阶级派性的材料。面对这种情况，班长倪金成在“十六条”的光辉指引下，紧紧依靠厂里的广大革命群众，狠抓阶级教育，组织战士和厂里革命群众冒雨到雨花台凭吊革命烈士，在烈士墓前认真学习毛主席关于实现革命大联合的最新指示，控诉了中国赫鲁晓夫反对广大革命人民群众活学活用毛主席著作的滔天罪行，以及阶级敌人阴谋破坏革命群众之间团结的阴谋活动。广大革命群众进一步增强了对伟大领袖毛主席的无比热爱，迫切地要求全面落实毛主席的最新指示，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，彻底闹革命。这样，群众促头头，头头搬山头，两派革命群众不久就实现了革命的大联合，又很快成立了革命委员会。在革委会的领导下，广大革命群众深入开展了革命大批判，顺藤摸瓜，揪出了一小撮阶级敌人，掀起了抓革命促生产的高潮。
    两年来的斗争实践，使我们深深体会到，毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”，是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的指路明灯。我们要坚决按照“十六条”办事，坚定不移地相信和依靠群众，紧紧团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的周围，加强无产阶级专政，加强对敌斗争，深入持久地开展革命的大批判，做好清理阶级队伍的工作，彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义路线的流毒，搞好斗、批、改，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
