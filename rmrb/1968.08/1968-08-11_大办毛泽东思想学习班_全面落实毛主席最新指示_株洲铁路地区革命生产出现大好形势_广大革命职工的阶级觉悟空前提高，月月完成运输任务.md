The revolutionary workers of the Zuzhou Railway Region, with the help of the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, have been conducting extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They have fully implemented Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions, promoting the deepening of the revolutionary criticism and struggle against the enemy, and raising the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the revolutionary workers. Since last August, all 22 units in the region, including sections, stations, and factories, have achieved revolutionary great unity from the bottom up. By the end of March this year, all units had achieved revolutionary three-in-one combinations and established revolutionary committees. Under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," the entire railway region is experiencing a great leap forward in both revolution and production. Compared to January, in June this year, locomotive supply increased by 10%, freight volume increased by 97%, loading and unloading volume increased by 80%, and vehicle repairs increased by 197%. The punctuality rates for passenger and freight transport have also significantly improved. Technical innovations and inventions have sprouted like bamboo shoots after a spring rain.

After the establishment of the Zuzhou Railway Region Revolutionary Committee, with the help of the military support personnel, following Chairman Mao's instructions to "hold study classes, which is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes," and considering the characteristics of the railway region with its many points and long lines, busy transport tasks, and dispersed personnel, extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes have been held. The region, units, workshops, teams, families, and households have all been involved, leading to a flourishing scene. So far, the region has held over 120 different types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with over 95% of the workers participating in at least one class, and some participating in multiple classes. Through these study classes, the class consciousness of the revolutionary workers has been greatly enhanced. They say that the process of holding study classes is the process of fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and carrying out the Party Central Committee's various orders, a process of criticizing and repudiating oneself and modifying one's thoughts, and a process of tempering one's loyalty to Chairman Mao. The Revolutionary Committee has emphasized class struggle in the study classes, conducting extensive class education through activities such as recalling past hardships, eating bitter meals, holding bitter struggle meetings, and singing bitter struggle songs. This has fundamentally raised the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the revolutionary workers, promoting the revolutionization of their thoughts. The revolutionary workers have made it a habit to read Chairman Mao's works every day, and the practice of studying and applying "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and the "Old Three Articles" has become widespread.

The Zuzhou Railway Region Revolutionary Committee has always adhered to the principle of class struggle, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, leading the revolutionary workers to carry out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism movement. They have adopted methods such as "team by team" and "class by class" to set up criticism battlefields everywhere, exposing, criticizing, and fighting against the revisionist black goods promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the region, such as the theory of "extinguishing class struggle," "exploitation is beneficial," "public-private fusion," and "joining the party for promotion." This has severely struck down the rightist reversal activities of the class enemies, consolidating and developing the newly established revolutionary committees. Not long ago, due to the sabotage by a small group of class enemies, the Zuzhou Locomotive Section experienced transportation chaos and production losses. Through revolutionary criticism, the revolutionary workers exposed this small group of class enemies, and the production situation underwent a fundamental change. Now, the Zuzhou Locomotive Section not only completes its own transportation tasks every month but also actively undertakes the transportation tasks of supporting external regions, receiving unanimous praise.

Currently, the Zuzhou Railway Region Revolutionary Committee is following the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, daring to streamline the organization, achieve unified leadership, change work styles, and closely connect with the masses. They are determined to build the Zuzhou Railway Region into a steel transportation line that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

　　大办毛泽东思想学习班　全面落实毛主席最新指示
　　株洲铁路地区革命生产出现大好形势
　　广大革命职工的阶级觉悟空前提高，月月完成运输任务
    本报讯　湖南株洲铁路地区广大革命职工，在中国人民解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，大办毛泽东思想学习班，全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，推动了革命大批判和对敌斗争的深入开展，提高了广大革命职工的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。从去年八月起，全地区段、站、厂等二十二个单位，自下而上地实现了革命的大联合。今年三月底，全部实现革命的三结合，成立了革命委员会。在伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”方针的指引下，整个铁路地区革命、生产一派大好景象。今年六月份与一月份比较，机车供应提高百分之十，货物运量增加百分之九十七，装、卸量提高百分之八十，车辆段修提高百分之一百九十七。客运和货运的正点率也有显著提高。技术革新、发明创造如雨后春笋般地开展起来。
    株洲铁路地区革命委员会成立以后，在解放军支左人员的帮助下，遵照毛主席“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的教导，根据铁路地区点多线长、运输任务繁忙、人员分散等特点，大办毛泽东思想学习班，把地区办、单位办，车间办、班组办，家属办、家庭办结合起来，以点带面，遍地开花。到目前为止，全地区已办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班一百二十多期，百分之九十五以上的职工参加过学习班的学习，有的还参加了几次。通过办毛泽东思想学习班，广大革命职工的阶级觉悟空前提高。他们说，办学习班的过程就是全面落实毛主席最新指示、贯彻党中央各项命令的过程，是斗私批修、自觉革命的过程，是锤炼永远忠于毛主席的红心的过程。革命委员会在学习班里狠抓阶级斗争，大搞回忆对比，吃忆苦饭，开忆苦会，唱忆苦歌等阶级教育，从根本上提高了广大革命职工的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，促进了人的思想革命化。广大革命职工天天读毛主席著作形成了制度，大学大用《毛主席语录》和“老三篇”蔚然成风。
    株洲铁路地区革命委员会始终坚持以阶级斗争为纲，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，率领广大革命职工深入持久地开展了轰轰烈烈的革命大批判；采取“组组为战”“班班为战”等方法，到处摆开大批判的战场，对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在本地区的代理人所推行的“阶级斗争熄灭”论、“剥削有功”论、“公私融合”论、“入党升官”论等反革命修正主义黑货，进行了大揭发、大批判、大斗争，狠狠打击了阶级敌人的右倾翻案活动，巩固和发展了新生的革命委员会。不久以前，株洲机务段由于一小撮阶级敌人的破坏，一度造成运输混乱，生产受到损失，广大革命职工通过革命的大批判，把一小撮阶级敌人挖了出来，生产面貌发生了根本变化。现在，株洲机务段不仅月月完成了自己的运输任务，而且主动承担支援外区的运输任务，获得了人们一致的好评。
    当前，株洲铁路地区革命委员会正遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，大胆精简机构，实现一元化的领导，改变工作作风，密切联系群众。他们决心把株洲铁路地区建成无限忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席革命路线的钢铁运输线。
