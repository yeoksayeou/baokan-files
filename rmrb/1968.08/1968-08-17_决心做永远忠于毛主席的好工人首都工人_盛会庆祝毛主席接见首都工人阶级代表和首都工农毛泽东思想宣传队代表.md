Capital workers express that they will definitely take Chairman Mao's warm concern as the strongest driving force to promote all work, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely unite around the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, deeply and persistently carry out the revolutionary criticism, grasp the revolution, and vigorously promote production. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and all work, they will fully play a leading role and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

A Xinhua News Agency report on August 16th stated: "We capital workers are closest to Chairman Mao and must be closest to Chairman Mao." More than 14,000 representatives of the capital's working class, with boundless loyalty and deep proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, gathered in the Beijing Workers' Stadium today to solemnly hold the "Capital Workers Warmly Celebrate the Great Leader Chairman Mao's Reception of Capital Workers' Representatives and Capital Workers-Peasants Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team Representatives Meeting."

The meeting, amid warm applause and cheers, passed a letter of respect to the great leader Chairman Mao. The letter said: "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Your warm reception is a call to arms, calling on us to advance victoriously and achieve new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution; your warm reception is a mobilization order, mobilizing us to charge forward with swords drawn, launching a more fierce attack on a handful of class enemies; your warm reception is a battle cry, inspiring us to march towards the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

In recent days, the entire capital has been immersed in the joy of the working class's festival. The great leader Chairman Mao has just presented precious gifts to the capital workers-peasants Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, and on the 15th, the important new directive from Chairman Mao was announced: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully play the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work. The working class should also continuously raise its political consciousness in the struggle." That day, Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin also received representatives of the capital's working class and other revolutionary fighters. The good news spread, and the capital workers, who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, carried the giant portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao, batch after batch, marching through the streets. From day to night, from night to dawn, the parade continued without end. They surged from all directions to Tiananmen Square, to Zhongnanhai, to the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, enthusiastically cheering Chairman Mao's warm reception and the issuance of Chairman Mao's new directive. Today, more than ten thousand representatives solemnly gathered to express the capital workers' boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to Chairman Mao, and to declare that they will definitely take Chairman Mao's warm concern as the strongest driving force to promote all work, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely unite around the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, deeply and persistently carry out the revolutionary criticism, grasp the revolution, and vigorously promote production. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and all work, they will fully play a leading role and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The meeting venue was filled with the vigorous spirit and fighting atmosphere of the working class. In the center of the stage hung the giant portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao, and around it were huge red banners: "Reply to the great leader Chairman Mao's warm concern with actual actions," "Thoroughly implement Chairman Mao's new directives without any deviation," "Grasp the revolution and vigorously promote production," "Long live the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." Representatives of the capital's working class from the front lines of class struggle and production struggle repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's new directives, sang revolutionary songs such as "The East Is Red" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," and continuously shouted enthusiastically: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!" "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!"

At the celebration meeting, responsible persons of the Beijing Workers' Congress, capital workers' representatives, and representatives of the capital workers-peasants Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team all spoke. They excitedly said, "The heavens are vast, the earth is vast, but not as vast as Chairman Mao's kindness. Parents are dear, but not as dear as Chairman Mao." Chairman Mao is heart to heart with us workers. We will forever be good workers loyal to Chairman Mao.

The workers' representatives unanimously expressed in their speeches that they will further strengthen revolutionary organizational discipline, closely follow each of Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, resolutely, swiftly, and without any deviation, implement each of Chairman Mao's new directives, and become models in implementing Chairman Mao's new directives.

The workers' representatives emphasized that the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin is the sole leadership center for the entire Party, the entire army, the entire nation, and all revolutionary masses. We must resolutely smash all the tricks and plots of the class enemies who attempt to sabotage and split the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. We must resolutely criticize the reactionary "multi-center theory" of the bourgeoisie, further criticize manifestations of bourgeois reactionary worldviews such as factionalism, individualism, and sectarianism, and resolutely oppose all two-faced actions.

They declared that the capital's working class will strive even harder to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in practice, "continuously raise their political consciousness in the struggle," especially to resolutely study and apply Chairman Mao's series of new directives, resolutely do the following: have only one center in the mind—the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin; have only one thought in the heart—the invincible Mao Zedong Thought; follow one line in action—the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao. Forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, forever loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, forever closely unite around the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, under the command of the proletarian headquarters, unify thoughts, unify steps, unify actions, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The meeting unanimously expressed that they will follow the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, continue to deeply and persistently carry out the revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary crimes of China's Khrushchev and his agent Peng Zhen in Beijing, do a good job in cleaning up the class ranks, and do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their own units, allowing the great Mao Zedong Thought to occupy all positions.

The capital workers' representatives present at the meeting expressed that they will resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp the revolution and promote production," strive to be the vanguard of the revolution and the pioneers of production, and with outstanding production achievements, respond to the great leader Chairman Mao's greatest trust and concern for the working class.

The meeting unanimously expressed that they will further implement Chairman Mao's great call to "support the army and love the people," learn from the People's Liberation Army, strengthen military-civilian unity, support and cherish the newly born revolutionary committees, consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, and build the capital into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.
