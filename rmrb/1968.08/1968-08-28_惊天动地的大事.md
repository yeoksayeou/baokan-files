	Red flags are flying high, and victory songs echo through the sky; in Beijing, good news is constantly being reported. Comrade Yao Wenyuan's important article "The Working Class Must Lead Everything" has conveyed the latest instructions from our most beloved and respected Great Leader Chairman Mao: "To achieve a proletarian cultural revolution in education, it is essential to have the leadership of the working class, the participation of the working masses, and the cooperation of the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. Together with the progressive elements among the students, teachers, and workers in the schools who are determined to carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end, they should form a revolutionary tripartite alliance. The worker propaganda teams should stay in the schools for a long time, participate in all the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and permanently lead the schools. In rural areas, schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants."

	Chairman Mao's latest instructions are a great strategic deployment by Chairman Mao, a mobilization order to launch a high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation under the leadership of the working class. Chairman Mao's latest instructions have expressed the innermost thoughts of our working class.

	Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Upon hearing your latest instructions, every member of the Tianjin San Tiao Shi Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team is deeply moved and tears of joy stream down our faces. We repeatedly shout, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Chairman Mao, may you live ten thousand years!" "Chairman Mao, may you live ten thousand times ten thousand years!" We wish you, our dear leader, eternal life! Eternal life! Eternal life!

	Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! We workers of San Tiao Shi, from our personal experiences, deeply feel that nothing is greater than the party's favor, and no one is closer than you, our dear leader. We will never forget: it was you who saved us from the fire, making us the masters of the state. We, who struggled on the brink of death in the old society and dared not even dream of going to school, at this moment of seizing the complete victory of the proletarian cultural revolution, have formed the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team according to your instructions and entered the universities to lead the proletarian cultural revolution in education. What a tremendous event this is! Today, you have instructed us, "The worker propaganda teams should stay in the schools for a long time, participate in all the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and permanently lead the schools." This is your greatest trust, encouragement, and spur for us workers, greatly boosting our morale and thoroughly dispelling the arrogance of the bourgeois "authorities."

	Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! The traitorous scoundrel China's Khrushchev, the biggest capitalist-roader within the party, has dared to defy your instructions and vigorously promote the bourgeois "intellectuals rule, laborers are ruled" revisionist educational line, allowing bourgeois intellectuals and reactionary "authorities" to long rule our schools, turning our socialist state's schools into important bases for cultivating bourgeois successors. This is intolerable!

	Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! We workers of San Tiao Shi, following your series of latest instructions, have organized propaganda teams to enter universities under the leadership of the Beijing working class, actively propagating your brilliant thoughts, participating in the struggle, criticism, and transformation in schools, and promoting revolutionary unity and the cleansing of class ranks. We have resolutely carried out your teachings, deeply entered the masses, conducted detailed investigations and research, relied on the progressive elements among the students, teachers, and workers in the schools who are determined to carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end, and in just a few days, solved problems that the intellectuals in the school had been entangled with and could not solve, achieving revolutionary unity in some classes and departments based on teaching classes. This ironclad fact has given those so-called "high-level intellectuals" who slander us workers for not understanding education a resounding slap in the face!

	Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! The working class leading the proletarian cultural revolution in education, with worker propaganda teams staying in schools for a long time to participate in all the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and permanently leading the schools, is still a new topic. However, the working class, armed with your brilliant thoughts, following your teachings of "learning war from war," will surely accomplish this great historical mission. We have the determination and confidence to lead the schools well. Under your wise command, the working class should lead everything, must lead everything, and is fully capable of leading everything. We workers have an unyielding loyalty to you, to your brilliant thoughts, and to your revolutionary line. We have the practical experience of the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment; we have suffered the most and have the deepest hatred in the old society, and we are the most indignant about the revisionist educational line promoted by China's Khrushchev. We are fully capable of creating a proletarian educational system that is consistent with theory and practice.

	Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! To complete the great historical mission you have entrusted to us, we workers of Tianjin San Tiao Shi are determined to seriously study your brilliant thoughts, carry forward your mass line and the fine tradition of investigation and research, continuously raise our political awareness, strengthen our revolutionary discipline, continuously criticize the corrupt influence of the bourgeoisie on our worker ranks, and tightly unite with our comrades in the People's Liberation Army and the revolutionary teachers, students, and workers in the schools around the proletarian headquarters led by you and Vice Commander Lin, under the orders of the proletarian headquarters, unify our understanding, steps, and actions, thoroughly criticize the reactionary "many centers mean no center" theory of the bourgeoisie, thoroughly smash all big and small "independent kingdoms," carry out a good revolutionary criticism, and steadily, accurately, and fiercely launch a powerful attack on a handful of spies, traitors, unrepentant capitalist-roaders, and untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, seizing the great victory of the educational revolution.

	Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! With you supporting us, we must make you proud. The workers of San Tiao Shi, who are infinitely loyal to you, will not disappoint your expectations. We are determined to complete the great historical mission you have entrusted to us and carry the proletarian cultural revolution in education through to the end!

    工人阶级必须领导一切
    惊天动地的大事
    天津市三条石工人毛泽东思想宣传队
    红旗招展，凯歌震天；北京城里，喜讯频传。姚文元同志的重要文章《工人阶级必须领导一切》，传来了我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示：“实现无产阶级教育革命，必须有工人阶级领导，必须有工人群众参加，配合解放军战士，同学校的学生、教员、工人中决心把无产阶级教育革命进行到底的积极分子实行革命的三结合。工人宣传队要在学校中长期留下去，参加学校中全部斗、批、改任务，并且永远领导学校。在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校。”毛主席的这一最新指示，是毛主席的伟大战略部署，是在工人阶级领导下掀起斗、批、改高潮的动员令。毛主席的最新指示，说出了我们工人阶级的心里话。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！我们三条石工人毛泽东思想宣传队听了您的最新指示，个个心情激动，流下了幸福激动的眼泪，我们一遍又一遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万万岁！”千遍万遍地祝愿您老人家万寿无疆！万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！我们三条石的工人阶级，从自己的亲身经历中，深深体会到，天大地大不如党的恩情大，爹亲娘亲不如您老人家亲。我们永远不会忘记：是您老人家把我们从火堆里拯救出来，当了国家的主人。我们这些在旧社会里挣扎在死亡线上，连想都不敢想进学校的穷哥们，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的时刻，遵照您老人家的指示，组成毛泽东思想宣传队，进驻大学，领导无产阶级教育革命。这是一件多么惊天动地的大事情！今天，您老人家又指示我们，“工人宣传队要在学校中长期留下去，参加学校中全部斗、批、改任务，并且永远领导学校。”这是您老人家对我们工人阶级的最大信任，最大鼓舞，最大鞭策，大长了我们工人阶级的志气，大灭了资产阶级“权威”的威风。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！罪该万死的中国赫鲁晓夫，这个党内最大的走资派，狗胆包天，长期以来，怀着复辟资本主义的狼子野心，对抗您老人家的指示，竭力推行资产阶级“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”的修正主义教育路线，让资产阶级知识分子和反动“权威”长期统治我们的学校，把我们社会主义国家的学校，作为他们培养资产阶级接班人的重要阵地，是可忍，孰不可忍！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！我们三条石的工人阶级，遵循您老人家的一系列最新指示，在北京工人阶级的带动下，及时地组织宣传队进驻大学，积极宣传您的光辉思想，参加学校的斗、批、改，促进学校的革命大联合和清理阶级队伍的工作。我们坚决执行了您老人家的教导，深入群众，进行细致的调查研究，依靠学校中的学生、教员、工人中决心把无产阶级教育革命进行到底的积极分子，在短短的几天内，就解决了这个学校知识分子纠缠不休不能解决的问题，促成了一些班、系以教学班为基础的革命大联合。这铁一般的事实，给了那些骂我们工人不懂教育的所谓“高级知识分子”一记响亮的耳光！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！我们工人阶级领导无产阶级教育革命，工人宣传队长期留在学校参加全部斗、批、改，并永远领导学校，这还是一个新的课题。但是，用您的光辉思想武装起来的工人阶级，遵循您的“从战争学习战争”的教导，一定能够完成这个伟大的历史使命。我们有决心有信心把学校领导好。在您的英明统帅下，我们工人阶级应当领导一切，必须领导一切，也完全能够领导一切。我们工人阶级有一颗无限忠于您，无限忠于您的光辉思想，无限忠于您的革命路线的赤胆忠心。我们有阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命运动的实践经验；我们在旧社会受的苦最大，仇最深，对中国赫鲁晓夫所推行的修正主义教育路线最愤恨。我们完全能够创造出理论与实践一致的无产阶级的教育制度。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！为完成您交给我们的伟大历史使命，我们天津三条石工人阶级，决心认真学好您的光辉思想，发扬您的群众路线和调查研究的优良作风，不断提高政治觉悟，加强革命纪律性，不断批判各种资产阶级腐朽作风对我们工人队伍的侵蚀和影响，和亲人解放军、学校中的革命师生员工，紧紧地团结在以您老人家为首、林副统帅为副的无产阶级司令部的周围，在无产阶级司令部的号令下，统一认识，统一步伐，统一行动，彻底批判资产阶级的反动的“多中心即无中心论”，彻底砸烂大大小小的“独立王国”，搞好革命的大批判，稳、准、狠地向一小撮特务、叛徒、死不悔改的走资派和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子展开猛烈的进攻，夺取教育革命的伟大胜利。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您老人家给我们撑腰，我们一定要给您老人家争气。无限忠于您的三条石工人，决不辜负您老人家的殷切期望，我们决心完成您老人家交给我们的伟大历史使命，把无产阶级教育革命进行到底！
