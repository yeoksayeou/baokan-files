Railroad workers are marching forward in heroism — a record of the revolutionary and production advancements at the Changsha Railway Bureau's Locomotive Section

The revolutionary committee of the Changsha Railway Bureau's Locomotive Section, since organizing large-scale Mao Zedong Thought study classes and actively applying Chairman Mao's works, has significantly raised the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad revolutionary staff. Good deeds and good people have emerged in abundance. Below are a few stories of their revolutionary and production advancements.

The convalescent hospital is almost empty

Due to the sabotage activities of a handful of class enemies, the locomotive section once experienced a relatively serious outbreak of anarchism. Some workers were late, left early, and had unexcused absences, causing production losses. In response to this situation, with the help of the military support team stationed at the section, the revolutionary committee organized all workers, cadres, family members, and patients to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes centered on opposing anarchism. Through study, the class consciousness of the broad masses of workers was greatly raised. They realized that the railway is the lifeline of the national economy, and whether they can follow Chairman Mao's instructions to "grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness" and excellently complete the production plan will have an important impact on socialist construction and the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution. Everyone was very dissatisfied with the anarchist situation in the section. Old worker Zhao Zhenyou took the lead in organizing an "old worker assault team," requesting tasks from the revolutionary committee, saying, "Although we are old, we have experience, we have a heart that loves Chairman Mao, let us drive if you need us to drive, let us stoke the fire if you need us to stoke the fire, assign us tasks!" The revolutionary spirit of the old workers deeply moved the broad revolutionary staff, who unanimously expressed their determination to learn from the old workers and dedicate themselves to the Party and Chairman Mao. The convalescent hospital in the locomotive section had a batch of patients, some of whom did not need to be hospitalized. Now they realize their mistake and have requested to be discharged, immediately organizing crew groups and voluntarily taking on tasks. In the end, the remaining thirty or forty old patients also requested to be discharged and assigned work. If it weren't for the doctors repeatedly persuading them to stay, the convalescent hospital would have been empty long ago.

From assigning tasks to competing for tasks

In the past, this locomotive section was always worried about not being able to complete tasks when they were assigned; after overcoming anarchism, everyone competes to be on duty. Now, when there are tasks, they have to be kept "secret" for a while. One morning, the revolutionary committee received an important transportation task and was about to hold a meeting to discuss it when, for some unknown reason, the meeting was leaked. Before the meeting could even begin, crew members requesting tasks had surrounded the revolutionary committee's office. Old drivers said, "We have experience, give the task to us." Young crew members said, "We are all young and strong, we'll take on this task." Even the patients in the ward rushed out, shouting, "My illness is completely cured, assign me work!" "Statements of resolve" and "guarantee letters" flew to the revolutionary committee like snowflakes. To express their determination to complete the task, the workers solemnly took an oath in front of the great leader Chairman Mao's portrait, vowing to dare to climb mountains of knives and cross seas of fire, and even if they had to sacrifice themselves, they would ensure the completion of this transportation task. Due to the large number of crews requesting tasks, the revolutionary committee had to issue an "order," deciding that the crew led by Zhang Zhanqian, the driver of the "1618 Rebel" locomotive, would be the vanguard to undertake this task, followed by locomotives 1262, 1306, and others. The crew members fought continuously for fifteen days and nights on a steel transportation line. Some worked for twenty-four hours straight without sleep, and some crew members worked while sick, excellently completing the glorious task entrusted by the Party and the people.

Voluntarily taking on "extra" work

In the past, when anarchism was rampant, this locomotive section relied on external support for production. After overcoming anarchism, the situation changed fundamentally. Now, not only is there no need for external support, but many "extra" tasks are also voluntarily taken on, providing strong support for the revolution and production of sister locomotive sections.

In Heilongjiang's Hailar, there are three locomotives transporting materials that, due to long-term operation, have significant parts missing and need repairs. The locomotive section used to only repair locomotives for its own section and did not accept external work. When the news came, the workers in the repair shop expressed their desire to break old frameworks and take on the task of repairing the Hailar locomotives. At that time, the third repair team of the repair shop took on this task. However, when the locomotive entered the factory, everyone was stumped: in the past, the workers repaired "anti-revisionist" locomotives, but these three locomotives were of the "liberation" type. The type of locomotive was different, the required parts, the size of the tools used, and the number of components that needed repair were also different. What to do? Just at this moment, comrades from the first, second, and fourth repair teams and other crews heard the news and rushed to support them. The workers forgot about rest, forgot about fatigue, and encouraged each other, "Make a firm decision, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." After four days and nights of struggle, from the boiler to the chimney, to every small screw, the workers conducted a thorough inspection and repair. Under collective cooperation, they finally repaired these three locomotives. The inspection quality was of high standards. On the day of delivery, everyone made three shining red sun patterns and placed them under Chairman Mao's portrait on the locomotive. The crew members of the Hailar locomotives repeatedly expressed, "You are truly the good workers of Chairman Mao's hometown!"

The Changsha Locomotive Section used to only be responsible for freight tasks. With the prosperity of the motherland's construction and the victorious development of the Cultural Revolution, the number of passengers traveling south and north increased daily, and passenger transportation became busier every day. Everyone proposed supporting sister units in transporting passengers. Initially, there was a small debate on this issue. Some people thought, "Passenger transportation has never been our responsibility. What if an accident happens, who will be responsible?" The majority of crew members did not agree with this view, saying, "Chairman Mao teaches us, 'Our responsibility is to the people.' We are crew members of the Changsha Railway Region, but we are first and foremost crew members of a socialist state. If the train cannot arrive at its destination on time, it will delay the precious time of tens of thousands of passengers to 'grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness.' This responsibility must first be borne by us crew members." With the support of the military support team stationed at the section, the crew members broke the so-called "division of labor" between freight and passenger transportation, boldly taking on the passenger transportation tasks. Since January of this year alone, this locomotive section has "voluntarily" pulled over a hundred passenger trains.

"As long as it benefits socialism, we will do it!"

In addition to actively supporting the production of sister locomotive sections, this locomotive section also actively supports the production of external units.

A machine at the Changsha Pharmaceutical Factory was broken and had not been used for over a year. After hearing the news, the workers from the repair shop of the locomotive section took the initiative to go and repair the machine, putting it back into production. Now, they have also taken on the repair tasks of some local factory machines, and the workers say, "Is work divided into internal and external? As long as it benefits socialism, we will do it!"

In September last year, a fault occurred on the railway leading to a certain steel plant in Hunan, the line was blocked, and coal transportation was difficult. The high furnace was about to go out. The crew members received this news and immediately organized forces to support them. The workers resolutely said, "Although we are not familiar with this line, the track base also has faults, and there are many difficulties, but we cannot stand by and watch state property be damaged. We cannot let a high furnace go out, affecting production." The train departed, with old driver and Communist Party member Yao Zongren waving the command flag at the front of the locomotive, leading the entire crew of locomotives 2062 and 1279 to break through one obstacle after another, sending car after car of coal to the certain steel plant. The good news came, and the crew members who rescued state property shouted thousands of times, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!"

With red flags flying and the sun rising in the east, the crew members of the Changsha Locomotive Section, who are firmly guarding the front line of socialist construction, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and bring forth wave after wave of victory songs of grasping revolution and promoting production. They grow vigorously under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought. The railway workers of Chairman Mao's hometown are marching forward in heroism.

　　铁路工人在英勇前进
　　——记湖南株洲铁路地区机务段抓革命促生产的故事
    湖南株洲铁路地区机务段革委会，自从大办毛泽东思想学习班，活学活用毛主席著作以来，广大革命职工的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟大大提高，好人好事层出不穷。下面是他们抓革命促生产的几个故事。
    疗养院的人快走完了
    由于一小撮阶级敌人的破坏活动，机务段曾一度出现较严重的无政府主义。有些职工迟到早退，无故缺勤现象较严重，生产受到损失。针对这种情况，在驻段解放军支左人员的帮助下，革命委员会把职工、干部、家属、病员等全部组织起来，举办以反对无政府主义为中心的毛泽东思想学习班。通过学习，广大职工的阶级觉悟大大提高，认识到铁路是国民经济的动脉，能不能按照毛主席“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”的教导，出色地完成生产计划，将对社会主义建设和夺取文化大革命的全面胜利产生重要影响。大家对段里发生的无政府主义情况非常不满。老工人赵振友带头组织一个“老工人突击队”，向革命委员会请求任务，说：“别看我们年纪大，我们有经验，我们有颗热爱毛主席的红彤彤的心，叫我们开车就开车，要我们烧火就烧火，分配我们任务吧！”老工人的革命精神，使广大革命职工深受感动，一致表示向老工人学习，向党和毛主席献忠心。机务段的疗养院住了一批病号，其中有一部分是不需要住院的。现在他们认识到自己的不对，纷纷要求出院，立即组织包乘组，主动承担任务。最后剩下的三四十名老病号也要求出院安排工作。要不是医生一再挽留，这个疗养院早就走空了。
    从派任务到争任务
    过去，这个机务段有任务总担心派不出去；克服无政府主义以后，人人争出勤，现在，有了任务，还得暂时“保密”。有一天上午，革委会接到一项重要运输任务，正准备开会研究时，不知怎么“泄了密”，会还没开成，请求任务的乘务员已把革委会办公室围得水泄不通。老司机说，我们有经验，把任务交给我们。青年乘务员说，我们都年轻力壮，这个任务我们包了。病房里的病员也纷纷跑出来嚷道：我的病完全好了，安排我工作吧！“决心书”“保证书”象雪片般的飞到革委会来。为了表示完成任务的决心，职工们庄严地在伟大领袖毛主席像前宣誓，表示刀山敢上，火海敢闯，那怕牺牲了自己，也要保证完成这项运输任务。由于请求任务的班组太多，最后只好由革委会下“命令”，决定以“1618造反号”机车司机张占前为首，组成包乘组，作为承担这项任务的开路先锋，1262、1306等五台机车接踵而上。乘务员们在一条钢铁运输线上，接连坚持十五个昼夜的战斗，有的人连续工作二十四个小时没有睡觉，有的乘务员带病坚守岗位，出色地完成了党和人民交给的光荣任务。
    主动承担“份外”活
    以前，当无政府主义严重时，这个机务段依靠外地支援进行生产，克服无政府主义以后，情况发生了根本变化。现在不仅不需要外地支援，还主动承担许多“份外”活，有力地支援了兄弟机务段的革命和生产。
    东北海拉尔有三台运送物资的机车，因长期在外跑，零件缺损较大，需要修理。机务段过去是专门为本段修理机车的，不接受外活。消息传来，修配车间的工人们表示要打破老框框，承担修理海拉尔机车的任务。当时由修配车间第三包修组同志们把这一任务承担了下来。谁知机车一进厂，却把大家难住了：过去工人们修的是“反修型”机车，这三台机车却是“解放型”的。机车的类型不同，需要的配件，使用工具尺寸的大小也不一样，机车需要修理的部件也比较多。怎么办？正在这个时候，一、二、四包修组和别的班组的同志们知道了，纷纷赶来支援。工人们忘记了休息，忘记了疲劳，相互传递着勉励的话：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”经过四天四宿的奋战，从锅炉、烟囱，到每个细小的螺丝钉，工人们都做了全面认真的检查修理。在集体协作下，终于把这三台机车修好了。检修的质量是高标准的。交车那天，大伙又作了三个金光闪烁的红太阳图案，放在机车头毛主席像下。海拉尔机车的乘务员们一再表示说：“你们不愧为毛主席故乡的好工人！”
    株洲机务段过去只负责货运任务。随着祖国建设的繁荣，无产阶级文化大革命的胜利开展，往南去北的旅客与日俱增，客运工作一天天忙起来。大家提出支援兄弟单位运送旅客。开初，对这个问题曾出现小小争论，有的人认为：“客运工作从来就不是我们的份，万一出了事故谁负责？”绝大多数乘务员不同意这个看法，说：“毛主席教导我们‘我们的责任，是向人民负责。’我们是株洲铁路地区乘务员，但我们首先是社会主义国家的乘务员，如果列车不能正点到达目的地，就要耽误成千上万的旅客‘抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备’的宝贵时间，这个责任首先要由我们乘务员来负。在驻段支左解放军的支持下，乘务员们打破了所谓货运和客运“分工”的框框，大胆地将客运任务承担了起来。仅从今年一月到现在，这个机务段就“义务”地拉了一百多趟客车。
    “只要对社会主义有益的事，我们就干！”
    这个机务段除了积极支援兄弟机务段的生产外，还积极支援外单位的生产。
    株洲制药厂有一台机器坏了，一年多不能使用。机务段修配车间的工人闻讯后，主动上门把这台机器修好，重新投入生产。现在，他们把一些地方工厂机器的修理任务也承担了起来，工人们说：“工作还分内外？只要对社会主义有益的事，我们就干！”
    去年九月，通往湖南某钢铁厂的铁路发生故障，线路不通，运煤困难，眼看高炉快要熄火。乘务员们得到这个消息，立即组织力量去支援。工人们坚决表示：尽管我们对这条线路不熟，路基又发生故障，困难很大，但是我们不能眼看国家的财产遭到损失，决不能让一个高炉熄火，影响生产。列车出发了，老司机、共产党员姚宗仁舞着指挥旗站在车头的最前面，率领2062、1279机车包乘组的全体同志，冲破一道道难关，把一车车煤送往某钢铁厂。喜讯传来，抢救国家财产的乘务员们千遍万遍高呼：毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！
    红旗招展，旭日东升，坚守在社会主义建设第一线的株洲机务段的乘务员们，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，传来抓革命、促生产的阵阵凯歌。他们在毛泽东思想哺育下茁壮成长，毛主席故乡的铁路工人在英勇前进。
