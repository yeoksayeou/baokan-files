Tianjin People's Automobile Factory No. 3's research group, composed mainly of workers and combining workers, worker-engineers, and revolutionary young technicians, has, under the support and assistance of the stationed People's Liberation Army and the factory revolutionary committee, raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. They have seized the scientific and technological power from the hands of the bourgeois reactionary "authorities" and, in a factory that had previously only been able to repair and maintain automobiles, successfully trial-produced an automobile chassis comprehensive inspection platform.

In Tianjin People's Automobile Factory No. 3, there are more than 160 public buses that need to be inspected for performance before they leave the factory every day. In the past, drivers used their ears, hands, and eyes to judge the braking performance and chassis output power of the automobiles. During the inspection, the driver would rev the engine to full throttle and then abruptly brake. This way, every inspection would cause damage to the tires, body, and steel plate springs. To change this situation, the factory accepted the task of trial-producing an automobile chassis comprehensive inspection platform in October 1965, as assigned by the state. The trial production of this new equipment began with a sharp struggle between two lines. The struggle focused on: relying on whom to trial-produce and which path to take. The workers advocated that the trial production should be carried out by a combination of workers and engineering technicians, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "self-reliance," and taking our own path to trial-produce an advanced automobile chassis comprehensive inspection platform suitable for use in China. However, a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and bourgeois reactionary "technical authorities" promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods of Liu Shaoqi's "expert management of factories" and "crawlism," relying only on a few people with titles such as engineer to blindly copy the foreign textbooks and foreign equipment frameworks, suppressing the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad revolutionary workers and revolutionary young technicians. They did absorb a few workers into the research group, but in reality, they only let the workers do manual labor and had no right to speak. Later, they simply transferred the workers one by one out of the research group, allowing the so-called chief engineers and engineers to monopolize the power and work in isolation. They worked for a year, wasting a large amount of national financial and material resources, and in the end, achieved nothing.

Chairman Mao personally formulated the "Sixteen Points," which states: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a powerful driving force for the development of productive forces in our country." In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, revolutionary workers raised the banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against the reactionaries" and rebelled against a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and bourgeois reactionary "technical authorities," seizing back the scientific and technological power and organizing their own "three-in-one" research groups. Throughout the trial production process, they followed Comrade Lin Biao's instructions on "studying Chairman Mao's works, studying with problems in mind, actively applying what is learned, combining learning with use, learning what is urgently needed, seeing immediate results, and focusing on the 'use' aspect." They insisted on using Mao Zedong Thought to guide the trial production work.

Chairman Mao taught us: "The most intelligent and talented are those with the most practical experience." The "three-in-one" research group, during the trial production process, seriously implemented the mass line with workers as the main body, fully mobilizing the enthusiasm and creativity of workers, worker-engineers, and student-engineers. The manufacture of the automobile braking force meter, which is used to inspect the braking performance of automobiles, was the first major project in the trial production of the automobile chassis comprehensive inspection platform. The factory's bourgeois reactionary "technical authorities" had previously referred to many foreign materials but did not listen to the workers' opinions, working for a long time without success. However, the workers, together with revolutionary young technicians, complemented each other's strengths and pooled their wisdom, finally solving the problem that the reactionary "technical authorities" thought was impossible to solve, and successfully manufactured the automobile braking force meter.

During the trial production process of the "three-in-one" research group, many examples fully proved that whenever workers and technicians combined well, the trial production project proceeded smoothly; otherwise, problems arose. For example, the flywheel of the inspection platform was designed by two young technicians who graduated from university. During the processing and manufacturing process, workers found more than 30 errors. After modifying according to the workers' opinions, it was successful; while the roller part was jointly designed by an old worker and a young technician, the worker's practical experience combined with the technician's theoretical knowledge, and the effect was good, fully meeting the inspection requirements.

A young technician who graduated from university three years ago, when designing a component of the inspection platform—a pulse transformer—based on her book knowledge, only knew that a certain high-grade alloy must be used for the iron core but did not know whether it could be replaced with something else. An old electrician told her that, from the perspective of inspecting automobiles, there was no need for such a high-grade alloy material. Silicon steel sheets could be used instead. The old worker also gave her a quote from Chairman Mao: "If you want knowledge, you must participate in the practice of transforming reality. If you want to know the taste of a pear, you must transform the pear and taste it yourself." The young technician was greatly educated and said: "Workers are my best teachers, not only the best teachers in technology but also the best teachers in politics."

This scientific experiment, under the joint efforts of workers and technicians, with the assistance of young technicians from the Institute of Traffic Science, was finally successfully completed in April this year. After more than three months of actual use, it was proven that the quality of the automobile chassis comprehensive inspection platform is excellent. When the automobile is driven onto the inspection platform, the instruments can accurately display the chassis output power and braking performance of the automobile. In the past, even the most experienced drivers needed about half an hour to manually inspect an automobile. Now it only takes five minutes, and the inspection is more accurate.

　　天津人民汽车三厂以工人为主的“三结合”科研小组
　　用毛泽东思想去指导试制工作
　　创造成功汽车底盘综合检验台
    据新华社天津电　天津人民汽车三厂的一些汽车司机、汽车修理工人同工人出身的工程技术人员和革命青年技术员相结合，在驻厂人民解放军和厂革委会的支持帮助下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，从资产阶级反动技术“权威”手中夺回了科学技术大权，在这个一向只能修理和保养汽车的工厂里，试制成功了汽车底盘综合检验台。
    在人民汽车三厂，每天都有一百六十多辆公共汽车需要在出厂前进行性能检验。过去，是由汽车司机用耳听、手摸、眼看来判定汽车的制动性能和底盘输出功率。在检验的时候，司机开足马力，然后猛地刹车。这样每检验一次，轮胎、车身和钢板弹簧都要受到损失。为了改变这种状况，这个厂在一九六五年十月接受了国家交给的试制汽车底盘综合检验台的任务。这种新设备的试制刚一开始，就出现了尖锐的两条路线斗争。斗争集中地表现在：依靠谁来试制，试制走什么道路。工人们主张试制要由工人和工程技术人员相结合，遵照毛主席关于“自力更生”的教导，走自己的路，试制适合我国应用的先进的汽车底盘综合检验台。但是，党内一小撮走资派和资产阶级反动技术“权威”却推行中国赫鲁晓夫的“专家治厂”、“爬行主义”等反革命修正主义黑货，只依靠那些有工程师等技术头衔的少数人，去生吞活剥地照抄外国书本上的洋教条和外国设备的洋框框，压制广大革命工人和革命青年技术人员的积极性和创造性。他们虽然也吸收个别工人参加科研组，但实际上只让工人干干下手活，根本没有发言权。到后来，他们干脆把工人一个一个地调离科研组，由所谓的总工程师、工程师独揽大权，闭门造车。他们搞了一年，浪费了国家大量财力和物力，结果一事无成。
    毛主席亲自主持制订的“十六条”中指出：“无产阶级文化大革命是使我国社会生产力发展的一个强大的推动力。”在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，革命职工高举“对反动派造反有理”的大旗，造了党内一小撮走资派和资产阶级反动技术“权威”的反，夺回了科学技术大权，自己组织了三结合的科研小组。他们在整个试制过程中，按照林副主席关于“学习毛主席著作，要带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影，在‘用’字上狠下功夫”的指示，坚持用毛泽东思想来指导试制工作。
    毛主席教导我们：“最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”三结合的科研小组在试制过程中认真贯彻执行了以工人为主体的群众路线，把工人、工人出身的和学生出身的技术人员的积极性和创造性充分地调动起来。制造检验汽车制动性能的汽车制动力表，是试制汽车底盘综合检验台的第一个大项目，这个厂的资产阶级反动技术“权威”过去搬过很多外国的资料，就是不听工人的意见，搞了很长的时间都没有成功。可是，工人们同革命的青年技术人员一起，互相取长补短，群策群力，终于解决了反动技术“权威”认为不可能解决的困难，制成了汽车制动力表。
    在三结合科研小组进行试制的过程中，许多事例都充分证明，凡是工人、技术人员结合得好的，试制项目就进行得顺利，反之就出问题。例如，检验台的飞轮是由两个学生出身的青年技术员设计的，在加工制造的过程中，工人发现有三十多处错误，按工人的意见修改以后才得到成功；而滚筒部分是由一个老工人和一个青年技术员共同设计的，工人的实践经验同技术员的理论知识结合起来，效果就好，完全符合检验的要求。
    一个三年前从大学毕业的青年技术员在设计检验台的一个部件——脉冲变压器的时候，她根据书本知识，只知道必须用某种高级合金做铁芯，但不知道是否可以用别的东西代替。一位老电工告诉她，从检验汽车的要求来看，根本不需要那么高级的合金做材料，用矽钢片就可以代替。老工人还送给她一条毛主席语录：“你要有知识，你就得参加变革现实的实践。你要知道梨子的滋味，你就得变革梨子，亲口吃一吃。”这个青年技术员受到很大教育，她说：“工人是我最好的老师，不但是技术上最好的老师，更重要的是政治上最好的老师。”
    这项科学实验工作在工人、技术人员共同努力下，在交通科学研究院青年技术人员的协助下，终于在今年四月份搞成功。经过三个多月的实际使用考验，证明汽车底盘综合检验台的质量很好。汽车开上检验台，仪表上就能准确地显示出汽车的底盘输出功率和制动性能。过去，用人工检验汽车，最有经验的司机也要用半个小时左右，现在只要五分钟就够了，而且检验得更准确。
