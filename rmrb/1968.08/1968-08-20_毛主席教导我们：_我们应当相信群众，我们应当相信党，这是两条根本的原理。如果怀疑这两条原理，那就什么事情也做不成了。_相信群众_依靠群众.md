Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must believe in the masses, we must believe in the Party. These are two fundamental principles. If we doubt these two principles, then we cannot accomplish anything."

Believe in the Masses, Rely on the Masses

Fan Zhongxiang
Member of the Beijing Railway Station Revolutionary Committee

In doing things, there is always the question of believing in and relying on whom. Chairman Mao repeatedly teaches us to believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and respect the masses' spirit of initiative. The Chinese Khrushchev, however, does the opposite. He only believes in a small clique of traitors, spies, and unrepentant capitalist-roaders within his bourgeois headquarters, while he oppresses the broad revolutionary masses, implementing the Kuomintang's "tutelage."

Whether to act according to Chairman Mao's instructions or the reactionary fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev is a major issue of whether to implement the proletarian revolutionary line or the bourgeois reactionary line; whether to strengthen or break the Party's ties with the masses; whether to consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat or weaken and sabotage it. Our recent experience in holding a study class on the Party's rectification at the station, with the content of studying Mao Zedong Thought, has deepened our understanding of this issue.

Chairman Mao has long taught us: "Invite active elements from among the non-Party masses to participate in Party branch meetings, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and thereby change the phenomenon of the Party's organization being impure in composition or impure in style, so that the Party and the people can be closely linked together."

The broad Party membership welcomes the absorption of non-Party masses into the Party's rectification study class on Mao Zedong Thought. Only a few comrades have reservations, fearing that non-Party masses might not be objective in their criticism. Before the study class was held, I did not seriously study Chairman Mao's instructions. I took the unnecessary concerns of a few Party members very seriously and began to worry: The revolutionary unity at the station is not yet consolidated. Can the Party members from one mass organization accept the criticism of Party members and non-Party masses from another mass organization? Will the original two factions quarrel because of the lingering bourgeois factionalism? Would it be better to temporarily not absorb non-Party masses into the study class?

The PLA's leftist cadre understood my thoughts and talked to me, and together with us, they studied Chairman Mao's instructions. Through the study, I realized that fearing the participation of non-Party masses in the Party's rectification study class is not only a lack of belief in the non-Party masses but also a lack of belief in the Party members.

The facts after the study class was held completely prove that the masses are reasonable and can act according to Mao Zedong Thought. The representatives of non-Party masses participating in the study class all seriously studied Chairman Mao's line on building the Party, helping to rectify the Party organization; at the same time, they humbly learned from the Party members, strictly requiring themselves according to the Party members' standards. Their criticism of some Party members was very sharp and to the point. Some Party comrades actively went to the masses to listen to their opinions and voluntarily engaged in self-criticism. Through recalling bitterness and sweetness and criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev, the relationship between Party members and the masses became closer, and the revolutionary great unity was further consolidated and developed.

The facts have educated me: Revolutionary masses are the reliance of our Party and the foundation of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line must believe in the masses and rely on the masses. The facts have also educated me: The poison of the reactionary fallacies spread by the Chinese Khrushchev, which portray the masses as "idiots" and "mob," must be further eradicated. Otherwise, when encountering problems, like the Chinese Khrushchev, believing that the masses are incapable of anything, we would be at a standstill. Our revolutionary committee would not be able to consolidate and develop, and the cause of socialism would not be able to advance.

### 毛主席教导我们：“我们应当相信群众，我们应当相信党，这是两条根本的原理。如果怀疑这两条原理，那就什么事情也做不成了。”　　相信群众　依靠群众

    毛主席教导我们：“我们应当相信群众，我们应当相信党，这是两条根本的原理。如果怀疑这两条原理，那就什么事情也做不成了。”
    相信群众　依靠群众
    北京车站革命委员会常委　范忠祥
    办事总有个相信谁、依靠谁的问题。毛主席反复教导我们要相信群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神。中国赫鲁晓夫则反其道而行之。他只相信他那个资产阶级司令部里的一小撮叛徒、特务和死不改悔的走资派，对广大革命人民群众则实行镇压，实行国民党的“训政”。
    按照毛主席的指示办事，还是按照中国赫鲁晓夫的反动谬论办事，这是执行无产阶级革命路线，还是执行资产阶级反动路线的大问题；是加强党和群众的联系，还是破坏党和群众的联系的大问题；是巩固和加强无产阶级专政，还是削弱和破坏无产阶级专政的大问题。最近我们车站举办以整党为内容的毛泽东思想学习班的经验，使我们对这个问题又有更深的认识。
    毛主席早就教导我们：“邀集党外群众中的积极分子参加党的支部会议，展开批评和自我批评，藉以改变党的组织的成份不纯或者作风不纯的现象，使党和人民群众密切地联系起来。”
    广大党员对于吸收党外群众参加整党的毛泽东思想学习班是非常欢迎的，只有个别同志有顾虑，怕党外群众提意见不实事求是。在办学习班以前，我没有认真学习毛主席的指示，把个别党员的不必要的担心看得很重，心里嘀咕开了：车站的革命大联合还不巩固，这一个群众组织的党员能不能接受另一个群众组织党员和党外群众的批评？会不会因为还存在一些资产阶级派性而引起原来两派群众的争吵？是不是暂时不吸收党外群众参加更好些？
    解放军支左人员了解了我的活思想，就找我谈话，并和我们一起学习毛主席的指示。经过学习，我认识到怕党外群众参加整党学习班，不但是不相信党外群众，也是不相信党员群众。
    学习班办起来以后的事实完全证明，群众是通情达理的，是能够按毛泽东思想办事的。参加学习班的党外群众代表，都认真学习毛主席的建党路线，帮助整顿好党组织；同时虚心地向党员学习，以党员标准严格要求自己。他们对一些党员提出的批评非常尖锐，切中要害。一些党员同志都主动到群众中去听取意见，自觉地作自我批评。通过忆苦思甜和批判中国赫鲁晓夫，党员和群众的关系越来越亲近了，革命的大联合也更加巩固和发展了。
    事实教育了我：革命群众是我们党的依靠，是无产阶级专政的基础。忠于毛主席的革命路线，就必须相信群众，依靠群众。事实也教育了我：中国赫鲁晓夫所散布的群众是“阿斗”、“群氓”的反动谬论的流毒，还要进一步肃清，否则，遇事象中国赫鲁晓夫那样，认为群众什么都不行，那就要寸步难行，我们革命委员会就不能巩固和发展，社会主义事业就不能前进。
