On August 18, 1966, our great leader Chairman Mao first reviewed the vast ranks of the Red Guards. From that day forward, a magnificent Red Guards movement surged across the entire country, shaking the world.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great revolution led by the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, mobilizing hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses. The Red Guards movement, which surged like a storm in the early days of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, is a revolutionary youth movement that arose to meet the needs of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Our great leader Chairman Mao warmly supported the Red Guards movement, this new revolutionary thing, and smashed the plot by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, such as the Chinese Khrushchev, to incite the masses to fight each other. Chairman Mao pointed out: "The revolutionary actions of the Red Guards 'show that they are indignant and denounce all exploiters and oppressors of the workers, peasants, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary parties—the landlord class, the bourgeoisie, imperialism, revisionism, and their running dogs.' It shows that rebellion against the reactionaries is justified. I express my warm support for you."

In the great struggle to expose the handful of traitors, spies, and capitalist-roaders headed by the Chinese Khrushchev, in the struggle to criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line represented by the Chinese Khrushchev, and in the struggle to thoroughly smash the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, the broad revolutionary Red Guards, holding high the banner of Chairman Mao's "Rebellion against the reactionaries is justified," have fought bravely, spreading the sparks of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution throughout the country, making imperialism, modern revisionism, and all exploiting classes tremble with fear. In the entire process of the development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Red Guards movement has played a certain pioneering role and made great contributions.

Chairman Mao has long made a scientific conclusion on the position and role of revolutionary youth movements in history from the perspective of Marxism-Leninism. In 1939, Chairman Mao pointed out: "Since the May Fourth Movement, what role have the Chinese youth played? They have played a certain vanguard role, which is acknowledged by everyone in the country except the diehards."

Chairman Mao also emphasized: "The fundamental revolutionary force is the workers and peasants, and the revolutionary leading class is the working class. 'How do we judge whether a young person is revolutionary? What standard do we use to distinguish him? There is only one standard, that is, whether he is willing to and actually combines with the broad masses of workers and peasants.' Here, Chairman Mao pointed out the only correct direction for the youth movement.

The working class and the broad masses of workers and peasants most hate the exploiting classes, are most willing to accept Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, most oppose the restoration of capitalism, and best understand the importance of consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. They have the thoroughness and firmness of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. Under the education of Mao Zedong Thought and the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, they can wage the most resolute struggle against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, launch the most powerful criticism against the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, and carry out the most thorough reform of the superstructure that reflects the interests of the exploiting classes and is not in line with the socialist economic base. The process of more than two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution fully proves that the broad Red Guards can only have a correct future and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end by combining with such a main force of workers, peasants, and soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao recently pointed out again: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully play the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work." Therefore, the Red Guards and all intellectual youth must take the working class as their teacher, constantly reform themselves in the long-term class struggle, sincerely accept the leadership of the working class, and seriously study Mao Zedong Thought, that is, the worldview of the working class. At present, student comrades should warmly welcome the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams composed of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and strive to blend in with the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

The editorial note of this newspaper on July 22 said: "I advise those students who look down on workers and peasants and think they are great to put down their airs." Is this wrong? Not at all. This refers to that small number of students who look down on workers and peasants and have airs, not the majority of students who value workers and peasants and are willing to learn from them. Is it not necessary to thoroughly correct this extremely wrong attitude of looking down on workers and peasants and thinking they are great? Our country is a proletarian dictatorship. This country does not need intellectuals who look down on workers and peasants. In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, all anti-proletarian thoughts should be criticized.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has opened up an unprecedented broad path for intellectual youth to combine with workers, peasants, and soldiers. The broad revolutionary Red Guards must resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call, steadfastly take the path of combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers, and be determined to be proletarian revolutionaries who will carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. Together with workers, peasants, and soldiers, we will win a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We sincerely hope that the broad Red Guards and revolutionary intellectual youth will continue to advance, humbly learn from workers, peasants, and the People's Liberation Army. Criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of the Chinese Khrushchev, criticize various reactionary fallacies of the bourgeoisie that look down on workers, peasants, and soldiers. Like workers, peasants, and soldiers, we must forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, be good children of the working people, and achieve new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Chairman Mao has placed great hopes in us revolutionary youth. We firmly believe that the revolutionary Red Guards and revolutionary youth, under the leadership of the working class, will combine with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, gradually mature in the long-term test of class struggle, overwhelm the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, overthrow imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries, and carry out the great cause of burying the old world and building a new world of communism to the end!

    坚定地走上同工农兵相结合的道路
    ——纪念毛主席首次检阅红卫兵两周年
    一九六六年八月十八日，我们伟大的统帅毛主席首次检阅了浩浩荡荡的红卫兵队伍。从此，一个波澜壮阔的红卫兵运动磅礴于全中国，震撼了全世界。
    无产阶级文化大革命，是在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部领导下，放手发动亿万革命群众的大革命。在无产阶级文化大革命初期风起云涌般展开的红卫兵运动，是适应无产阶级专政下继续革命而产生的革命青年运动。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席热烈地支持了红卫兵运动这个革命的新生事物，粉碎了当时中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派挑动群众斗群众的阴谋。毛主席指出：红卫兵的革命行动，“说明对一切剥削压迫工人、农民、革命知识分子和革命党派的地主阶级、资产阶级、帝国主义、修正主义和他们的走狗，表示愤怒和申讨，说明对反动派造反有理，我向你们表示热烈支持。”
    在揭露以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的一小撮叛徒、特务、走资派的伟大斗争中，在批判以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的反革命修正主义路线的斗争中，在大破资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯的斗争中，广大革命的红卫兵小将高举毛主席“对反动派造反有理”的大旗，进行了英勇的斗争，在全国传播了无产阶级文化大革命的火种，使帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切剥削阶级闻风丧胆。在整个无产阶级文化大革命运动发展过程中，红卫兵运动起了某种先导的作用，作出了巨大的贡献。
    革命的青年运动在历史上的地位和作用，毛主席早就作过马克思列宁主义的科学结论。毛主席在一九三九年指出：“‘五四’以来，中国青年们起了什么作用呢？起了某种先锋队的作用，这是全国除开顽固分子以外，一切的人都承认的。”
    毛主席又着重指出：“根本的革命力量是工农，革命的领导阶级是工人阶级。”“看一个青年是不是革命的，拿什么做标准呢？拿什么去辨别他呢？只有一个标准，这就是看他愿意不愿意、并且实行不实行和广大的工农群众结合在一块。”在这里，毛主席为青年运动指出了唯一正确的方向。
    工人阶级和广大工农劳动群众，最仇恨剥削阶级，最容易接受马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，最反对资本主义复辟，最懂得巩固无产阶级专政的重要意义，具有无产阶级专政下继续革命的彻底性和坚定性。他们在毛泽东思想的教育下，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的领导下，能够对党内一小撮走资派进行最坚决的斗争，对反革命修正主义路线进行最有力的批判，对那些反映剥削阶级利益、不适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑进行最彻底的改革。两年多无产阶级文化大革命的进程充分证明了，广大红卫兵只有同用毛泽东思想武装起来的这样一支工农兵主力军相结合，才能有正确的前途，才能把这场无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    毛主席最近又一次指出：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。”因此，红卫兵和一切知识青年都必须拜工人阶级为师，在长期的阶级斗争中，不断改造自己，认真接受工人阶级的领导，认真学习毛泽东思想，即工人阶级的世界观。当前，学生同志们应当热烈欢迎由工农兵组成的毛泽东思想宣传队，努力同工农兵打成一片。
    本报七月二十二日编者按中说：“奉劝那些轻视工农、自己以为很了不起的大学生放下架子”。说错了吗？完全不错。这里说的是“轻视工农”又有架子的那一小部分大学生，而不是指那些重视工农、愿意向工农学习的大多数大学生。轻视工农而又自己以为了不起，这种极端错误的态度，难道还不该彻底改正吗？我们的国家是无产阶级专政的国家。这个国家不需要轻视工农的知识分子。在这场无产阶级文化大革命中，一切反无产阶级的思想都应受到批判。
    无产阶级文化大革命开辟了知识青年与工农兵相结合的空前宽广的道路。广大革命的红卫兵小将们，要坚决地响应毛主席的伟大号召，坚定地走与工农兵相结合的道路，决心做把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派，同工农兵一起，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。我们热切地希望，广大的红卫兵小将和革命的知识青年，要继续前进，要虚心向工人、农民学习，向解放军学习。要批判中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义教育路线，批判种种轻视工农兵的资产阶级反动谬论。要象工农兵那样，永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，做劳动人民的好儿女，在无产阶级文化大革命中立新功。
    毛主席对我们革命青年，寄予了无限的希望。我们坚信革命的红卫兵和革命的青年们，必将在工人阶级的领导下，同广大的工农兵结合在一起，在长期的阶级斗争的考验中逐步成熟起来，压倒资产阶级和一切剥削阶级，打倒帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，把埋葬旧世界、创建新世界的共产主义伟大事业进行到底！
