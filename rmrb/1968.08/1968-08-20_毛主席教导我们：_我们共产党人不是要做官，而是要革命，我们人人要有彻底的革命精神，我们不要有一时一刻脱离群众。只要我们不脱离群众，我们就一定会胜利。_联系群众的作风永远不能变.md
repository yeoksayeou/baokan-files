Chairman Mao teaches us: “We Communists are not seeking office, but are seeking revolution. We must all have a thorough spirit of revolution. We must never, even for a moment, fall into the error of separating ourselves from the masses. As long as we do not separate ourselves from the masses, we shall certainly be victorious.”

	I am a simple, uneducated person. From a young age, I grew up with poor friends in the wind, rain, and mud. After liberation, I joined the Party and came to Beijing Station to work as a baggage handler. Being able to serve the people at Chairman Mao's welcoming gate made me indescribably happy. Day and night, I worked with my comrades, putting all my strength into carrying baggage. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we also put all our strength into fighting against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party.

	Recently, the Beijing Station Revolutionary Committee was established, and everyone elected me as a standing committee member. Once I became a standing committee member, unknowingly, I spent more time in the office and less time with my original work unit. I saw my fellow workers less often, and we labored together even less, gradually becoming more distant.

	One day, I went to my original work unit. My comrades saw me and immediately asked, “Old Qiú, why are you here? Do you have something to do?” These words struck me like thunder. I was stunned and asked myself: What is going on? In the past, I was with everyone every day, and no one would be surprised to see me in the work unit. But now, when I come to the work unit, it seems like something unusual is happening. I thought about it and realized: In this period, I have been floating above, and for my original work unit, it seems like I only come when there is something important to do. The relationship with my comrades who used to labor and fight together has become more distant!

	I thought of the past at Beijing Station: At that time, the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party lived in luxury, far away from the masses and far away from labor. Occasionally, they would go to the grassroots to inspect, just to show off. One capitalist roader once went to the ticket office to “labor.” For this “labor,” they mobilized a large number of people, with some maintaining order in front and some counting money behind. She only sold two tickets and then left, but she did not forget to have her picture taken to publicize her “labor.” As a result, the photo came out with the abacus in front of her placed upside down, making her look ridiculous.

	Thinking of these things, I warned myself: We are people's servants who have come out of the masses' movement, struggling and fighting. We must never separate ourselves from the masses and labor, or we will go astray and become bureaucrats! Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: “The most fundamental principle of reforming state organs is to link with the masses.” Our revolutionary committee was born in the stormy movement of the masses; the people are the source of power for the proletarian dictatorship. Every member of the revolutionary committee is a servant of the people, and we must think of the people in everything we do, never separating ourselves from the masses. Only by firmly relying on the masses and closely linking with the masses can we consolidate and develop the revolutionary committee. The Chinese Khrushchev tries to corrupt us with the “join the Party to seek office” theory, but we will not fall for his tricks. We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, forever maintain our blood ties with the masses, forever maintain the character of the working people, and forever be servants of the people.

    毛主席教导我们：“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命，我们人人要有彻底的革命精神，我们不要有一时一刻脱离群众。只要我们不脱离群众，我们就一定会胜利。”
    联系群众的作风永远不能变
    北京车站革命委员会常委　邱兰池
    我是个大老粗，从小和穷哥儿们一起在风里、雨里、泥巴里滚大的。解放后，我入了党，来到北京站行李房当行李员。能在毛主席的迎宾门为人民服务，我感到说不出的高兴。我日夜和同志们在一起，把浑身的力气都使出来扛行李。无产阶级文化大革命中，我们也一起把浑身的力气都使出来跟党内一小撮走资派作斗争。
    前不久，北京站成立革命委员会，大家选我当常委。一当常委，不知不觉，呆在办公室里的时间多了，和原来班组的同志见面就少了，一起劳动更少了，关系渐渐疏远起来。
    有一天，我到原来的班组里去，同志们见了劈头就问：“老邱，你怎么来了，有什么事吗？”这句话象轰雷一样打在我灵魂深处。我怔住了，自己问自己：这是怎么回事？过去我每天跟大家滚在一起，人在班组，大家从不奇怪，不在班组，大家倒要问我到哪里去了。为什么现在见我来到班组，反倒象是件新鲜事了呢？想来想去，我想出了道理：这一段时间尽浮在上面，对于原来的班组，真象有点“无事不登三宝殿”的味道，同原来一起劳动、一起战斗的同志，就有点距离了！
    我想起北京站过去的情景：那时党内一小撮走资派，养尊处优，跟群众离得远远的，跟劳动离得远远的，偶尔到基层去转转，也是为了装装样子。有个走资派，曾经到售票车间参加“劳动”。为了她这次“劳动”，竟兴师动众，在前面有维持秩序的，在后面有代她数钱的，而她只卖了两张票就走了，但是却没有忘了让人给她照像，宣扬她这次“劳动”。结果，像片印出来，她面前桌上的算盘却倒放着，出尽了丑。
    想起这些，我警告自己：我们是从群众运动中摸爬滚打出来的人民勤务员，可千万不能脱离群众，脱离劳动，走到邪路上去，变成官老爷啊！伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”我们革命委员会是在群众运动的暴风雨中诞生的；人民群众才是无产阶级政权力量的源泉。我们革命委员会的每个成员，都是人民的勤务员，要事事、处处为群众着想，一时一刻也不脱离群众。只有坚决依靠群众，密切联系群众，才能巩固和发展革命委员会。中国赫鲁晓夫妄图用
  “入党做官”论腐蚀我们，我们决不上中国赫鲁晓夫的当。我们一定要遵照毛主席的教导，永远保持和群众的血肉联系，永远保持劳动人民的本色，永远做人民的勤务员。
