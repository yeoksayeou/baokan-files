Soldiers of the First Company of a certain regiment of the People's Liberation Army Engineering Corps treat the construction site as a battlefield. They thoroughly criticize the reactionary bourgeois "multi-center theory," and are determined, under the command of Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters, to unify their will, unify their steps, and unify their actions. They vow to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.
