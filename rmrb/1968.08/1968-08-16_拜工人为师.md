During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we were sent to Beijing Station to carry out the task of supporting the left. We deeply felt that by following Chairman Mao's great teachings, seriously listening to the workers' opinions, and humbly learning from the working class, we could continuously raise our awareness of class struggle and two-line struggle in the face of the stormy waves of class struggle, and promote the active development of the "three supports" and "two militaries" work.

As the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution continued to develop, the revolutionary committee of Beijing Station was established. Some of our comrades thought that since the power was now in the hands of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, they should pay less attention to the revolution and more to production. Some even focused only on daily tasks such as sweeping the floor, mopping, checking tickets, and managing the station. An old worker told us, "Comrade soldiers, now that the revolutionary committee is established, we workers are overjoyed, but the class enemies are furious. We must not just focus on production and forget about class struggle!" The old worker's words made us alert. We realized that the class enemies at Beijing Station were not willing to admit defeat. They were using more cunning and hidden methods to try to sabotage the newly established revolutionary committee. Facing the complex reality of class struggle, we felt more and more that the working class had the foresight. Their class struggle consciousness was strong, and their awareness of two-line struggle was high. Under the joint efforts of all revolutionary staff at the station, we finally exposed a small group of spies and remnants of the reactionary Nationalist Party who were spreading rumors, stirring up trouble, playing double games, and creating internal strife within the working class.

Once, while we were on duty on a train, we encountered Comrade Zhu Jinguang, an active learner of Mao Zedong Thought and an old worker from the Cangzhou Railway Section, who was traveling from Cangzhou to Beijing for a meeting. On the train, he enthusiastically praised the great leader Chairman Mao and propagated the great Mao Zedong Thought, which deeply moved us. Comrade Zhu Jinguang had suffered greatly in the old society, and he had deep proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao and a high level of two-line struggle awareness. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he actively participated in the struggle to expose and criticize the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. After arriving in Beijing, we invited him to our unit to share his experiences. Through learning from the working class, we greatly enhanced our consciousness of defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in the new situation of class struggle.

We, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, are the children of the people and the pillars of the proletarian dictatorship. We are always united with the working class and the revolutionary masses of the proletariat nationwide. We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's latest instructions, learn from the working class, take the working class as our example, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, be infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, and closely unite around the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, to create new merits for the all-around victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    拜工人为师编辑同志：
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们到北京站执行支左任务。我们深深体会到，遵照毛主席的伟大教导，认真听取工人的意见，虚心向工人阶级学习，就能在阶级斗争大风大浪中，不断提高两条路线斗争觉悟，促进“三支”“两军”工作的积极开展。
    随着无产阶级文化大革命形势不断发展，北京站革命委员会成立了。我们有些同志认为，大权已由无产阶级革命派掌握，因此，对革命关心少了，对生产关心多了。甚至有人光抓扫地、拖地、检票，进站等日常工作。一位老工人对我们说：“解放军同志啊，革命委员会成立了，我们工人阶级喜上眉梢，阶级敌人恨在心头，咱们可不能只抓生产，忘记阶级斗争啊！”老工人的话，引起了我们的警惕。我们发现北京站的阶级敌人并不甘心失败，他们正以更狡猾、更隐蔽的手法，企图使新生的革命委员会夭折。面对复杂的阶级斗争现实，越想越觉得工人阶级最有远见。他们的阶级斗争观念强，两条路线斗争觉悟高。在全站革命职工一致努力下，终于揪出了一小撮煽阴风，点邪火，大耍两面派，制造工人阶级内部纠纷的特务和国民党反动派残渣余孽。
    一次，我们在列车上值勤，正遇上沧州铁路段学习毛泽东思想积极分子、护路老工人朱井全同志从沧州上车到北京开会。在列车上，他热情洋溢地歌颂伟大领袖毛主席，宣传伟大的毛泽东思想，使我们很受感动。朱井全同志在旧社会苦大仇深，他对毛主席怀有深厚的无产阶级感情，有高度的路线斗争觉悟，在无产阶级文化大革命中，他积极投入了揭发和批判党内一小撮走资派的斗争。到北京以后，我们就请他到我们连队谈体会。通过向工人阶级学习，大大增强了我们在阶级斗争新形势下捍卫毛主席革命路线的自觉性。
    我们中国人民解放军是人民的子弟兵，是无产阶级专政的柱石。我们同工人阶级和全国无产阶级革命派，永远心连心，我们一定要遵照毛主席的最新指示，向工人阶级学习，以工人阶级为榜样，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席，紧紧团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的周围，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利创建新的功勋。
