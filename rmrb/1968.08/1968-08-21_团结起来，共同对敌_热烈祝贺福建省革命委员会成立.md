Under the inspiration of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and under the wise leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, following the establishment of the Yunnan Provincial Revolutionary Committee, the revolutionary committee of the frontline of our country's national defense—Fujian Province—has been born in victory!

This is another great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! It is another great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line! We express our highest respect and warmest congratulations to the 17 million people of Fujian Province and the soldiers and officers of the land, sea, and air forces on the Fujian front!

Fujian Province faces the Taiwan Strait and is the southeastern gateway of our great socialist motherland. It is the forward position for the liberation of our national territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu. The establishment of the Fujian Provincial Revolutionary Committee has thoroughly shattered the illusions of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Fujian, Ye Fei, Fan Shiren, and Hou Zhenya, who attempted to restore capitalism. The already formidable defense line of our southeastern coast is now even more united. This is a heavy blow to American imperialism and its running dogs, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits; it has significant strategic importance for consolidating our national defense and strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The people of Fujian have a glorious revolutionary tradition. As early as the Second Revolutionary Civil War, our great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao personally led the Red Army, spreading the flames of revolutionary armed struggle from Jinggangshan to Fujian. Chairman Mao wrote the ever-shining Guiding Principles of the Gutian Conference here, pointing out the fundamental direction for the construction of our party and army, and guiding the Chinese people from victory to victory. The great Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice have always inspired the revolutionary struggle of the 17 million people of Fujian.

Since liberation, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Fujian, representing the interests of the Kuomintang reactionaries, imperialism, the bourgeoisie, and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, have been colluding with the remnants of the Kuomintang, stubbornly pushing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line. They have done everything they could to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, attempting to block the advance of the revolutionary wheel.

The revolutionary masses of Fujian, who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, under the command of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, have displayed great revolutionary spirit, engaged in repeated and fierce struggles, thoroughly smashed the various plots and tricks of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents and all counter-revolutionary elements who stubbornly resisted, and won a decisive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army stationed on the Fujian front, who hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, together with the broad revolutionary masses, have resolutely struck back at the provocations of the American-Chiang bandits along the Fujian coast, safeguarding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They enthusiastically propagate, resolutely carry out, and bravely defend Chairman Mao's latest instructions, firmly engaging in a head-on struggle with the handful of capitalist roaders within the party. In the "three supports, two militaries," and national defense struggles, they have established great merit.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must not, because of our victories, relax our vigilance against the crazed revenge plots of the imperialist elements and their running dogs. Whoever relaxes this vigilance will politically disarm himself and put himself in a passive position."

The soldiers and people of Fujian on the frontline of national defense, bearing the serious task of fighting the enemy, must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings, unite to fight the enemy, and never relax their vigilance. We must fully recognize that the closer our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution comes to complete victory, the more fiercely the American-Chiang bandits, and the handful of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist roaders, and untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists will struggle.

We must further deepen the criticism of the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line. We must fully mobilize the masses and seriously carry out the work of cleansing the class ranks. We must strengthen our preparedness for war and be ready at any time to liberate Taiwan. We must seriously implement Chairman Mao's people's war strategy, closely rely on the masses, and consolidate the iron wall of our national coast. We must resolutely, thoroughly, completely, and utterly annihilate any American-Chiang bandits who dare to invade our frontline.

The military and civilian people of Fujian must further carry out the movement of supporting the army and loving the people, strengthen the unity between the army and the people, strengthen the unity between the revolutionary committee and the broad revolutionary masses, and strengthen the unity within the revolutionary committee. The revolutionary masses must cherish and support the newly born revolutionary committee, cherish and support the People's Liberation Army, further consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance by industry, by class, and by system, and resolutely smash the enemy's plots of sowing discord and spreading rumors to sabotage.

"The core force leading our cause is the Communist Party of China." The proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin is the sole leadership center for the entire party, the entire army, the entire nation, and the broad revolutionary masses. We must closely unite around the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, unify our thinking and actions under the command of the proletarian headquarters, thoroughly smash the rightist, splitist theory of "multiple centers is no center," and resolutely oppose the bad practice of being two-faced.

Chairman Mao recently pointed out again: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully give play to the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work. The working class should also continuously raise its political consciousness in the struggle." In the educational revolution and in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the superstructure in all fields, we must resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's instructions. Under the leadership of the revolutionary committee, the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, with workers as the main body and with the participation of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, will gradually enter schools and all other units that have not yet carried out the struggle, criticism, and transformation well, promoting revolutionary great alliances, promoting the cleansing of the class ranks, promoting the educational revolution, and seriously carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation. This is a revolutionary innovation based on Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. We must grasp this matter well and, in the midst of a great situation, carry the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

We hope that after the establishment of the Fujian Provincial Revolutionary Committee, it will raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, be infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, lead tens of millions of people to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, and for every instruction of the great leader Chairman Mao and every order of the proletarian headquarters, we must study it seriously, carry it out resolutely, implement it thoroughly, and summarize experiences in a timely manner. As long as we follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, we will definitely make continuous progress and achieve a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution even faster.

    团结起来，共同对敌
    ——热烈祝贺福建省革命委员会成立
    《人民日报》《解放军报》社论
    在伟大领袖毛主席最新指示鼓舞下，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的英明领导下，紧接着云南省革命委员会的成立，祖国海防的最前线——福建省的革命委员会胜利诞生了！
    这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的又一伟大胜利！是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的又一伟大胜利！我们向一千七百万福建省人民和福建前线陆海空三军指战员，表示崇高的敬意和最热烈的祝贺！
    福建省面临台湾海峡，是伟大社会主义祖国的东南大门，是我们解放祖国领土台、澎、金、马的前进阵地。福建省革命委员会的成立，彻底粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在福建的代理人叶飞、范式人、侯振亚之流妄图复辟资本主义的迷梦。早已森严壁垒的我国东南海防前线，现在，更加众志成城。这对于美帝国主义和它的走狗蒋介石匪帮，是一个沉重的打击；对于巩固我国国防，加强无产阶级专政，具有重大的战略意义。
    福建人民有着光荣的革命传统。早在第二次国内革命战争时期，我们伟大统帅毛主席就亲自率领工农红军，把在井冈山燃起的革命武装斗争烈火扩展到福建。毛主席在这里亲手写下了永放光芒的古田会议决议，为我党我军建设指明了根本方向，引导着中国人民从胜利走向胜利。伟大的毛泽东思想和毛主席的伟大革命实践，始终鼓舞着一千七百万福建人民的革命斗争。
    解放以来，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在福建的代理人，代表国民党反动派的利益，代表帝国主义、资产阶级和地、富、反、坏、右的利益，招降纳叛，结党营私，同社会上国民党残渣余孽相勾结，顽固地推行反革命修正主义路线。他们竭力破坏无产阶级文化大革命，妄想阻挡革命车轮的前进。
    无限忠于毛主席的福建无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的统帅下，发扬大无畏的革命精神，经过反复的激烈的搏斗，彻底粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人和一切反革命分子负隅顽抗的种种阴谋诡计，赢得了无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利。
    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的人民解放军驻福建前线部队广大指战员，同广大革命人民群众一起，坚决打击了美蒋匪帮对福建沿海的窜扰活动，保卫了无产阶级文化大革命。他们热情宣传、坚决执行、勇敢捍卫毛主席的最新指示，坚定地同党内一小撮走资派进行针锋相对的斗争，在“三支”“两军”和保卫国防的斗争中建立了巨大功绩。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“我们决不可因为胜利，而放松对于帝国主义分子及其走狗们的疯狂的报复阴谋的警惕性，谁要是放松这一项警惕性，谁就将在政治上解除武装，而使自己处于被动的地位。”
    战斗在国防第一线的福建军民，肩负着严重的对敌斗争任务，一定要牢牢记住毛主席的教导，团结对敌，决不能放松自己的警惕性。必须充分认识到，我们的无产阶级文化大革命越是接近全面胜利，美蒋匪帮，以及一小撮叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派、没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，必然要进行垂死挣扎。
    我们一定要进一步深入地批判中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线。我们一定要充分发动群众，认真做好清理阶级队伍的工作。我们一定要加强战备，随时准备解放台湾。我们一定要认真贯彻毛主席的人民战争思想，紧紧地依靠人民群众，巩固祖国海疆这个钢铁长城。对于那些敢于来侵犯我国前线的美蒋匪帮，必须坚决、彻底、干净、全部地歼灭之。
    福建省军民要进一步开展拥军爱民运动，加强军民之间的团结，加强革命委员会和广大革命群众的团结，加强革命委员会内部的团结。革命群众要爱护和支持新生的革命委员会，爱护和支持人民解放军，进一步巩固和发展按行业，按班级，按系统的革命大联合，坚决粉碎阶级敌人挑拨离间、造谣破坏的阴谋活动。
      “领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党。”以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，是全党、全军、全国和广大革命群众唯一的领导中心。我们一定要紧紧地团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的周围，在无产阶级司令部的号令下统一思想、统一行动，彻底粉碎右倾分裂主义的“多中心即无中心论”，坚决反对阳奉阴违的两面派的坏作风。
    毛主席最近又一次指出：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”在教育革命中，在上层建筑各个领域的斗、批、改中，都要坚决执行毛主席这个指示。在革命委员会的领导下，以工人为主体的、有解放军指战员参加的毛泽东思想宣传队有步骤地进入学校及其他一切还没有搞好斗、批、改的单位，促进革命的大联合，促进清理阶级队伍，促进教育革命，认真搞好斗、批、改，就是根据毛主席伟大战略部署而来的一个革命的创举。必须把这件事抓好，在一片大好形势下，把史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    我们希望：福建省革命委员会成立以后，要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席，领导千百万群众活学活用毛泽东思想。对伟大领袖毛主席的每一个指示，对毛主席的无产阶级司令部的每一个号令，都必须认真学习，坚决照办，彻底执行，及时总结经验。只要我们紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，就一定能不断前进，更快地夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
