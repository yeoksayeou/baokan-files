The Jinan Locomotive Factory Revolutionary Committee, in the process of fully mobilizing the masses to clean up the class ranks, timely grasped the active thoughts of the masses, armed the masses with great Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's policies and strategies, and struck a small handful of class enemies steadily, accurately, and resolutely.

Using Mao Zedong Thought to Arm the Broad Revolutionary Masses and Direct the Struggle Against a Small Handful of Class Enemies

The Jinan Locomotive Factory is an old factory with a history of over fifty years. It has successively undergone nearly forty years of reactionary rule by German and Japanese imperialists and the Kuomintang reactionaries. After Jinan was liberated in 1948, it returned to the hands of the people. However, due to the implementation of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line by the Chinese Khrushchev, a small handful of class enemies infiltrated the enterprise and controlled many important departments. Over the past decade, the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads in this factory has been sharp and complex. In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the struggle has become even more intense. The factory revolutionary committee, in order to lead the broad masses to carry the political revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat to the end, paid attention to using policies to educate the masses in the process of fully mobilizing the masses to clean up the class ranks, strictly distinguishing between the two types of contradictions, uniting all possible forces, and striking a small handful of class enemies steadily, accurately, and resolutely.

At the beginning of the struggle against the enemy, some masses, due to unclear understanding, advocated criticizing those who often complain and speak rudely, and those with general lifestyle problems. The factory revolutionary committee analyzed this situation and believed that the key issue in launching the struggle against the enemy and cleaning up the class ranks was to determine who the target was. It was necessary to guide the broad revolutionary masses with the policies and thoughts of the great leader Chairman Mao, so that the movement could develop victoriously along the track of Mao Zedong Thought.

After the great leader Chairman Mao issued the latest directive that "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the broad revolutionary masses under its leadership and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie," the members of the revolutionary committee went deep into the front line of the struggle and studied Chairman Mao's latest directive with the broad masses. Through the study, everyone realized that to carry this political revolution to the end, it was necessary to follow Chairman Mao's directive and strictly distinguish between the two types of contradictions. They must follow Chairman Mao's teaching: "Our army has always had two policies: first, be ruthless to the enemy, suppress it, and annihilate it; second, be united with our own people, with the people, with comrades, with superiors, and with subordinates." They directed the struggle against a small handful of class enemies, exposing those hidden within the revolutionary ranks. At this time, a small handful of class enemies took the opportunity to play new tricks. They appeared in an ultra-leftist guise, spreading rumors, and trying to muddy the waters and slip through. After the class enemies spread their poisonous winds, those with general political and historical problems became worried and burdened with ideological baggage. The factory revolutionary committee promptly discovered this new trend and believed it to be the new conspiracy of the class enemies in the new situation, which must be resolutely exposed and thoroughly smashed. Through the study, the masses saw clearly and determined that the main target of cleaning up the class ranks was to aim at a small handful of traitors, spies, and other counter-revolutionaries.

After the broad masses grasped Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's policies, the work of cleaning up the class ranks proceeded in the direction indicated by the great leader Chairman Mao, smashing the conspiracy of the class enemies to shift the target of the struggle.

To rectify organizationally, one must first rectify ideologically

After exposing a small handful of class enemies, some masses again had the idea of relaxing, mistakenly believing that the class enemies had all been exposed, and that organizational handling was the responsibility of the revolutionary committee. The factory revolutionary committee believed that merely exposing without criticizing, and merely digging without struggling, was a manifestation of insufficient understanding of the profound significance of revolutionary criticism. Aiming at this ideology, the members of the revolutionary committee again went deep into the front line and studied with the broad masses Chairman Mao's teaching: "To rectify organizationally, one must first rectify ideologically, and carry out a struggle between the proletariat and the non-proletariat ideologically" and "Our current important task on the ideological front is to carry out a criticism of revisionism." Through the study, they realized that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was not only to expose a few bad people but more importantly to carry out thorough criticism politically and ideologically, and to eliminate the poison of counter-revolutionary revisionism. For this, it was necessary to thoroughly criticize and expose the black goods of Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in this unit. Exposing traitors, spies, and all counter-revolutionaries was only to organizationally smash the class enemies, but this was not enough; it was also necessary to politically and ideologically overthrow and expose them. Thus, the workers of the entire factory posted a large number of big-character posters and small-character posters, and held various types of criticism meetings. In addition to participating in the large and medium-sized criticism meetings held by the entire factory and various workshops, the broad revolutionary workers also voluntarily organized class criticism meetings, launching a magnificent wave of revolutionary criticism.

They used the exposed class enemies as living teaching materials, linking them with their mastermind, Chinese Khrushchev, and fiercely exposing and criticizing them, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a powerful and sharp weapon to subdue the enemy. The broad revolutionary masses, in connection with the crimes of a small handful of capitalist roaders within the factory party who protected and promoted traitors, spies, and other counter-revolutionaries, systematically criticized the revisionist cadre line and organizational line of Chinese Khrushchev of forming cliques and recruiting traitors, making everyone, in the face of living class struggle facts, raise their awareness of the struggle between the two lines. Because the factory revolutionary committee closely linked the exposure and criticism of a small handful of class enemies in this unit with the elimination of the poison of Chinese Khrushchev's revisionism, and linked the revolutionary criticism with the struggle against the enemy in this unit, the struggle against the enemy and the revolutionary criticism in the entire factory were carried out magnificently and in depth.

Giving the policy to the masses, letting the masses educate themselves and liberate themselves

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Policy and strategy are the lifeblood of the Party. All levels of leadership must pay full attention to this and never be careless." In the struggle against the enemy, who should we rely on? Who should we unite with? The Jinan Locomotive Factory Revolutionary Committee repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's series of latest directives in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, further firmly relying on the proletarian revolutionaries who are determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, uniting more than ninety-five percent of the masses and cadres, and mobilizing the masses to let the masses educate themselves and liberate themselves.

The factory revolutionary committee, in order to fully mobilize the masses, also held a special Mao Zedong Thought study class on the struggle against the enemy, first organizing the cadres of the factory's various levels of revolutionary committees and the backbone of the mass organizations to study Chairman Mao's relevant directives and the Party's policies. The factory revolutionary committee required the proletarian revolutionaries to carefully guide the masses, seriously grasp the policies, and actively and ruthlessly clean up the bad elements that had infiltrated the revolutionary mass organizations. At the beginning, some people in the revolutionary mass organizations had the idea of "pulling out the radish with the mud, making one's own face look bad"; some people who had previously been associated with bad elements were afraid that cleaning up the bad elements would implicate themselves; those who had previously executed the bourgeois reactionary line were afraid that if they did not handle it well, they would be accused of "executing the new bourgeois reactionary line." Aiming at these active thoughts, the factory revolutionary committee and the cadres of various levels of revolutionary committees and mass organizations studied the "Sixteen Points," recognizing the fundamental difference between Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the bourgeois reactionary line pursued by Chinese Khrushchev. In the early days of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a small handful of capitalist roaders within the factory shifted the direction of the struggle, labeling a large number of people as "counter-revolutionaries," attempting to use the method of striking a large area to protect themselves. Later, the proletarian revolutionaries and the broad revolutionary masses rose up to rebel against the bourgeois reactionary line, and the vast majority of those labeled as "counter-revolutionaries" participated in the revolutionary mass organizations. Now, discovering that there are a few bad elements among them, of course, they should be exposed. Everyone said: "We are now exposing bad elements to purify the proletarian revolutionary ranks, defend the headquarters of the proletarian revolution led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and prevent our country from changing color. This is fundamentally different from the bourgeois reactionary line pursued by Chinese Khrushchev in the early days of the movement." Because everyone had a clear policy boundary and raised their awareness of the struggle between the two lines, they resolutely exposed the bad elements and active counter-revolutionaries mixed in their own ranks. Those who originally had this or that concern said: "Exposing bad elements is a concrete manifestation of our defense of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, a great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line." A part of the party members in a workshop, who had previously been deceived by the counter-revolutionaries who had infiltrated the party, stood on the wrong side, and some had been dissatisfied with the revolutionary rebels for a long time, saw through the cleaning up of the class ranks that the proletarian revolutionaries voluntarily exposed the bad elements in their own ranks, and they happily said: The proletarian revolutionaries are listening to Chairman Mao's words. We will definitely unite on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought in the future and jointly fight the enemy.

Currently, the revolution in this factory is carried out magnificently, and the relationship between the cadres and the masses is further strengthened; production is booming, and the state plan for the first half of the year has been overfulfilled. The revolutionary committee has further consolidated and developed in the struggle against the enemy, gaining the support and love of the broad masses.

    本报讯　济南机车工厂革命委员会，在充分发动群众清理阶级队伍的工作中，及时掌握群众的活思想，用伟大的毛泽东思想和党的政策、策略武装群众，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人。
    用毛泽东思想武装广大革命群众，把斗争矛头对准一小撮阶级敌人
    济南机车工厂是一个有五十多年历史的老厂，先后经过德、日帝国主义和国民党反动派近四十年的反动统治。一九四八年济南解放后，才回到人民手中。但是由于中国赫鲁晓夫推行反革命修正主义路线，使一小撮阶级敌人混进了企业内部，把持了许多重要部门。十几年来，这个厂两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争一直是尖锐复杂的；在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，斗争就更加激烈。厂革命委员会为了率领广大群众把无产阶级专政条件下的政治大革命进行到底，在充分发动群众清理阶级队伍的过程中，注意用政策教育群众，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，团结一切可以团结的力量，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人。
    在对敌斗争开始时，部分群众由于认识模糊，有的主张对平常爱发牢骚，爱说调皮话，和有一般生活作风问题的人，也进行批判。厂革委会分析了这种情况，认为开展对敌斗争，清理阶级队伍，矛头究竟指向谁，是一个关键性的问题，必须用伟大领袖毛主席的政策思想统帅广大革命群众，使运动沿着毛泽东思想的轨道胜利发展。
    毛主席关于“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续”的最新指示发出后，革委会成员深入到斗争第一线，和广大群众一起学习毛主席这一最新指示。通过学习，大家认识到，要把这一场政治大革命进行到底，必须遵照毛主席的指示，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾。要遵照毛主席的教导：“我们的军队一向就有两条方针：第一对敌人要狠，要压倒它，要消灭它；第二对自己人、对人民、对同志、对官长、对部下要和，要团结。”他们把斗争矛头紧紧对准一小撮阶级敌人，一举把隐藏在革命队伍内部的阶级敌人揭发出来。就在这时，一小撮阶级敌人乘机玩弄新的花招，他们以极“左”的面目出现，煽阴风，点邪火，散布谣言，企图把水搅混，蒙混过关。阶级敌人放出阴风之后，使有一般政治历史问题的人顾虑重重，背上了思想包袱。工厂革委会及时地发现了这个新动向，认为这就是阶级敌人在新形势下玩弄的新阴谋，必须坚决揭露，彻底粉碎。通过学习，群众眼明心亮，认定清理阶级队伍的主要目标是对准一小撮叛徒、特务和其他反革命分子。
    毛泽东思想和党的政策为广大群众掌握后，清理阶级队伍的工作沿着伟大领袖毛主席所指引的方向前进，粉碎了阶级敌人妄图转移斗争目标的阴谋。
    要从组织上整顿，首先要从思想上整顿
    把一小撮阶级敌人揭露出来之后，在部分群众中又产生了松口气的思想，错误地认为阶级敌人都揭露出来了，组织处理是革委会的事。工厂革委会认为，光揭不批，光挖不斗，是对革命大批判的深远意义认识不足的表现。针对这种思想，革委会成员又深入第一线，同广大群众一起学习了毛主席“为要从组织上整顿，首先需要在思想上整顿，需要展开一个无产阶级对非无产阶级的思想斗争”和“我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判”的教导。通过学习，他们认识到，无产阶级文化大革命，不仅仅是为着揭露出几个坏人，更重要的是要从政治上、思想上进行彻底的批判，肃清反革命修正主义流毒。为此，必须把中国赫鲁晓夫和他在本单位的代理人的反革命修正主义黑货批倒批臭、批深批透。把叛徒、特务和一切反革命分子揭露出来，这只是从组织上把阶级敌人摧垮，但这还不够，还必须从政治上、思想上把他们斗倒批臭。于是，全厂职工纷纷贴出了大量的批判大字报、小字报，召开了各种类型的批判会。广大革命职工除了参加全厂和各车间召开的大中型批判会外，还自动组织了班组批判会，掀起轰轰烈烈的革命大批判高潮。
    他们把揭露出来的阶级敌人作为活教材，同他们的总后台中国赫鲁晓夫挂起钩来，狠狠地进行揭发批判，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想这个强大的锐利武器制服敌人。广大革命群众联系本厂党内一小撮走资派包庇和重用叛徒、特务及其他反革命分子的罪行，系统地批判了中国赫鲁晓夫结党营私、招降纳叛的修正主义干部路线和组织路线，使大家在活生生的阶级斗争事实面前，提高了两条路线斗争觉悟。由于厂革委会把对本单位一小撮阶级敌人的揭发批判，同肃清中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义流毒密切结合起来，把革命大批判同本单位的对敌斗争结合起来，使全厂对敌斗争和革命大批判搞得轰轰烈烈和深入细致。
    把政策交给群众，让群众自己教育自己，自己解放自己
    毛主席教导我们：“政策和策略是党的生命，各级领导同志务必充分注意，万万不可粗心大意。”在对敌斗争中究竟依靠谁？团结谁？济南机车工厂革命委员会反复地学习了毛主席在无产阶级文化大革命中的一系列最新指示，进一步坚定不移地依靠了决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派，团结百分之九十五以上的群众和干部，放手发动群众，让群众自己教育自己，自己解放自己。
    工厂革委会为了充分放手发动群众，还举办了对敌斗争的专题毛泽东思想学习班，首先组织工厂各级革委会以及群众组织的骨干学习毛主席的有关指示和党的方针政策。厂革委会要求无产阶级革命派细心引导群众，认真掌握政策，对混入革命群众组织的坏人，要主动地毫不留情地进行清理。开始，革命群众组织中有一部分人存有“拔出萝卜带出泥，自己脸上不好看”的思想；有的人过去跟一些坏人有过联系，怕清理出坏人，会牵连自己；过去执行过资产阶级反动路线的同志怕弄不好，会被说成“执行新的资产阶级反动路线”。针对这些活思想，厂革委会同各级革委会和群众组织的骨干，学习了“十六条”，认清毛主席的无产阶级革命路线同中国赫鲁晓夫所推行的资产阶级反动路线的根本区别。无产阶级文化大革命初期，厂党内一小撮走资派转移斗争大方向，把一大批人打成“反革命”，就是妄图用打击一大片的手段，保护自己一小撮过关。后来，无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众起来造了资产阶级反动路线的反，被打成“反革命”的人绝大多数参加了革命群众组织。现在，发现其中有个别坏人，当然应该把他揭露出来。大家说：“我们现在揪出坏人，是为了纯洁无产阶级革命队伍，捍卫以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，使我们国家不变颜色，这同运动初期中国赫鲁晓夫推行的资产阶级反动路线有着本质的区别。”由于大家有了明确的政策界限和提高了两条路线斗争的觉悟，坚定不移地把混在自己队伍中的坏人和现行反革命分子揭露出来。原来有这种或那种顾虑的同志说：“揭露出坏人，这是我们捍卫毛主席革命路线的具体的表现，是毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利。”有一个车间的一部分党员，过去受到钻进党内的反革命分子的蒙蔽，站错了队，有的人长期对革命造反派不服气，通过清理阶级队伍，见到无产阶级革命派自动地把自己队伍中的坏人揭露出来，他们高兴地说：无产阶级革命派就是听毛主席的话，我们今后一定要在毛泽东思想的基础上团结起来，共同对敌。
    目前，这个厂的革命搞得轰轰烈烈，干群关系进一步密切起来；生产搞得蒸蒸日上，上半年的国家计划超额完成。革命委员会在对敌斗争中进一步巩固和发展，得到了广大群众的拥护和爱戴。
