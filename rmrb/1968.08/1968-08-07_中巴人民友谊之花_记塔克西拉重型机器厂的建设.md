In the northeastern part of Rawalpindi, the temporary capital of Pakistan, about twenty miles away, lies Taxila. Just a year ago, this place was a vast expanse of wild grass. Now, rows of concrete pillars, foundations of factory buildings, and temporary workshops stand tall. Vehicles and people flow endlessly, and several hundred Pakistani construction workers are working diligently. This is the construction site of the Taxila Heavy Machinery Factory, built with the help of Chinese technical personnel according to the 1965 economic and technical cooperation agreement between China and Pakistan.

On the 500-acre construction site, two small buildings have been completed. One is the experimental workshop of the factory's affiliated technical school, where over a hundred Pakistani youths are learning to operate various machine tools shipped from China. The other building is the factory's affiliated technical school, which is training technical workers for the under-construction heavy machinery factory.

The Chinese technical personnel living on the construction site and helping with the building work start their day by holding the Little Red Book and reciting Chairman Mao's quotations in unison. Then, they begin their day's work. Some work alongside Pakistani workers, while others collaborate with Pakistani engineering and technical personnel to study construction plans. To help the Pakistani people build, they work tirelessly. Pakistani workers love working with Chinese engineering and technical personnel, affectionately calling them their "best friends."

Chinese technical personnel and Pakistani workers learn from each other and exchange experiences during their joint work, continually improving technical operations. Through their joint efforts, they improved the metal welding method, significantly enhancing work efficiency. Pakistani workers praised, "Chinese friends treat people equally and are willing to teach their skills without reservation."

When the Chinese engineering and technical personnel first arrived in Pakistan, their hospitable Pakistani hosts wanted to arrange for them to stay in local hotels and be driven to the construction site daily. However, the Chinese technical personnel insisted on staying in temporary workshops on the construction site. Pakistan is in the tropics, and the outdoor temperature often exceeds 40 degrees Celsius in summer, making the indoors very hot as well. The Pakistani hosts wanted to install air conditioners for them, but this was politely declined. The Chinese technical personnel's frugal and hardworking spirit left a deep impression on the Pakistani people.

The Chinese engineering and technical personnel's good practice of going deep into the field and participating in labor received high praise from Pakistani workers. During the construction process, whenever technical issues arose, Chinese technical personnel would promptly rush to the scene, work alongside Pakistani workers, and jointly find solutions. When building the main warehouse, several hundred square meters of the roof needed to be covered with cement, requiring continuous work to be completed in one go. All the Chinese technical personnel and Pakistani workers worked together intensely, carrying sand and gravel and mixing cement. Pakistani workers gave thumbs up and cheered. A Pakistani carpenter said, "The experts sent by Chairman Mao, regardless of their position, work together with the workers, truly admirable." Whenever he saw Chinese technical personnel, he would enthusiastically shout, "Long live Chairman Mao!"

Through long-term joint work, Chinese engineering and technical personnel and Pakistani workers have formed a deep friendship. One day, two Chinese technical personnel were about to return to China. Two Pakistani fitters, upon hearing the news, rushed to the airport dozens of miles away at 2 a.m. to see them off. They were tearful and warmly shook hands with their Chinese friends to say goodbye. Another time, two other Chinese technical personnel were preparing to return to China. The villagers of Usman Dak village near the construction site held a warm send-off party upon hearing the news. Villagers played folk instruments to welcome them from a neighboring village to the venue. A Pakistani friend said passionately at the send-off party, "Two Chinese friends came from the land where the red sun rises to help build the heavy machinery factory in Pakistan and are now returning to the red sun!" The villagers enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

The Taxila Heavy Machinery Factory is Pakistan's first heavy machinery factory. A responsible person from the West Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation, which is in charge of building the Taxila Heavy Machinery Factory, said, "Only a true friend like China is willing to help us build such heavy industry. From the construction of the Taxila Heavy Machinery Factory, I see that China is a true friend of the peoples of Asia and Africa."

　　中巴人民友谊之花
　　——记塔克西拉重型机器厂的建设
    在巴基斯坦临时首都拉瓦尔品第市东北二十多英里的地方，便是塔克西拉。一年以前，这里还是一片杂草丛生的旷野。现在，矗立起了一排排水泥柱，一方方厂房的地基，一座座工棚。车辆人群，川流不息，几百名巴基斯坦建筑工人在紧张地劳动着。这就是根据一九六五年中巴经济和技术合作协定、在中国技术人员帮助下，正在建设的塔克西拉重型机器厂的工地。
    在占地五百英亩的工地上，两座小型建筑物已经落成。一座是这个工厂附属技工学校的实验工场，上百名巴基斯坦青年正在里面学习操作从中国运去的各式机床。另一座建筑物是这个工厂的附属技工学校，正在为兴建中的重型机器厂培养技术工人。
    住在这个工地上帮助建设的中国技术人员，他们每天清晨，手捧红色宝书，齐声朗读毛主席语录。然后，开始一天紧张的工作。有的和巴基斯坦工人一起劳动，有的和巴基斯坦工程技术人员共同研究施工方案。为了帮助巴基斯坦人民的建设，他们忘我地劳动着。巴基斯坦工人们非常喜欢和中国工程技术人员一起工作，他们亲切地称呼中国工程技术人员是他们“最好的朋友”。
    中国技术人员和巴基斯坦工人在共同劳动中，互相学习，交流经验，不断改进技术操作过程。在共同努力下，改进了金属焊接方法，大大提高了工作效率。巴基斯坦工人赞扬说：“中国朋友待人平等，又肯把技术毫无保留地教给别人。”
    中国工程技术人员刚刚来到巴基斯坦的时候，殷勤好客的巴基斯坦主人要安排他们住在当地的旅馆里，每天用汽车接送他们去工地。但是中国的工程技术人员坚持住到工地的临时工棚里。巴基斯坦地处热带，夏天室外气温经常高达四十度以上，室内也非常热。巴基斯坦主人要为他们安装冷气机，也被他们婉言谢绝了。中国技术人员这种艰苦朴素的优良作风给巴基斯坦人民留下深刻的印象。
    中国工程技术人员深入现场、参加劳动的好作风，受到巴基斯坦工人的热烈赞扬。在工地施工过程中发生技术问题时，中国技术人员总是及时赶到现场，和巴基斯坦工人一起动手，共同研究解决。在修建总仓库时，几百平方米的屋顶铺水泥，需要连续作业，一口气完工。全体中国技术人员和巴基斯坦工人们一起紧张地运沙石，打灰。巴基斯坦工人竖起大拇指，连声叫好。一位巴基斯坦木工说：“毛主席派来的中国专家，不论职位高低，都和工人一起劳动，真是好。”他见到中国技术人员时，经常热情地高呼：“毛主席万岁！”
    中国工程技术人员和巴基斯坦工人在长期共同劳动中结成了深厚的友谊。有一天，有两名中国技术人员将要回国了，两名巴基斯坦钳工知道了这个消息后，在深夜两点钟赶到几十里外的机场送行。他们饱含热泪，热情地和中国朋友握手告别。有一次，另外两名中国技术人员准备回国，工地附近的乌斯曼达克村上的农民听到消息以后，热情地举行了欢送会。村民们奏着民间乐器把他们从邻村接到会场。一位巴基斯坦朋友在欢送会上热情洋溢地说：“两位中国朋友从红太阳升起的地方来到巴基斯坦，帮助建设重机厂，现在又要回到红太阳身边了！”村民们热情高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    塔克西拉重型机器厂是巴基斯坦的第一个重型机器厂。负责建设塔克西拉重型机器厂的西巴基斯坦工业发展公司的一位负责人说：“只有真正的朋友中国，才愿意帮助我们建设这样的重工业。从塔克西拉重型机器厂的建设，我看到了中国是亚非各国人民真正的朋友。”
