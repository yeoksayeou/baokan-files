The Guangdong Province People's Committee to Support Hong Kong and Kowloon Compatriots in Anti-British Struggle today issued a statement regarding the British authorities in Hong Kong's announcement on August 14 to cancel the registration of the Chinese Middle School.

The statement points out that this is a new provocation against the Chinese people and Hong Kong compatriots, and we once again strongly protest against the Hong Kong British authorities.

The statement says that the Hong Kong British authorities, as early as last November, used various excuses to forcibly close the Chinese Middle School premises. Now, after the so-called "closure order" expires, they have unreasonably announced the cancellation of the Chinese Middle School's registration. This arrogant and unreasonable action fully exposes the ugly face of British imperialism in Hong Kong.

The statement emphasizes that Hong Kong is Chinese territory. Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots studying and propagating Mao Zedong Thought, and carrying out patriotic educational undertakings, is the sacred right of Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots, and no one is allowed to infringe upon it under any pretext. The Hong Kong British authorities attempt to open a breach by canceling the registration of the Chinese Middle School to further strangle the patriotic educational cause in Hong Kong, which is nothing but a pipe dream. The patriotic educational cause in Hong Kong is unblockable, the student movement is unpressable, and the patriotic educational cause in Hong Kong not only will continue but will be even better. Every debt you owe to the Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots must be settled, the more you owe, the heavier you must repay, and you cannot escape responsibility.

The statement finally expresses that we firmly support the just struggle of the Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots and firmly support the five serious demands of the Chinese Middle School in Hong Kong to the Hong Kong British authorities. The Hong Kong British authorities' forcible announcement of the cancellation of the Chinese Middle School's registration is utterly unreasonable. We firmly oppose it.

The statement solemnly warns the Hong Kong British authorities: Do not misjudge the situation. If you continue to persist in your mistakes and stubbornly oppose the Chinese people, deliberately worsening the situation in Hong Kong, then this will only provoke broader and more intense resistance from the Hong Kong compatriots, and you will only end up with the shameful outcome of lifting a stone only to drop it on your own feet.

    严重抗议港英强行宣布取消中华中学注册
    坚决支持香港中华中学的五项严正要求
    新华社广州十七日电　广东省人民支援港九爱国同胞反英抗暴斗争委员会今天就香港英国当局悍然在八月十四日宣布取消中华中学注册发表声明。
    声明指出，这是对中国人民和香港爱国同胞进行新的挑衅，我们再次向香港英国当局提出严重抗议。
    声明说，香港英国当局早在去年十一月间就用各种借口强行封闭了中华中学校舍。现在，在所谓“封闭令”满期之后，竟又无理宣布取消中华中学注册。这种蛮横无理的作法，充分暴露了港英帝国主义的狰狞面目。
    声明强调说，香港是中国的领土。港九爱国同胞学习和宣传毛泽东思想，举办爱国教育事业，是港九爱国同胞的神圣权利，决不允许任何人以任何借口加以侵犯。港英当局妄图以取消中华中学注册来打开缺口，进一步扼杀香港爱国教育事业，这只能是痴心妄想。香港的爱国教育事业是“封”不了的，学生运动是压不下去的，香港的爱国教育事业不仅要继续办下去，而且将会越办越好。你们对港九爱国同胞所欠下的每一笔债，都必须清算，欠的越多，偿的越重，要想逃脱罪责是办不到的。
    声明最后表示，我们坚决支持港九爱国同胞的正义斗争，坚决支持香港中华中学向港英当局提出的五项严正要求。港英当局强行宣布取消中华中学注册是毫无道理的。我们坚决反对。
    声明严正警告香港英国当局：你们不要错误地估计形势，如果你们继续执迷不悟，一意孤行，顽固地与中国人民为敌，硬要恶化香港局势，那么，这只能激起香港爱国同胞更广泛更剧烈的反抗，只能落得个搬起石头打自己的脚的可耻下场。
