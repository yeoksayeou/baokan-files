	Rejoice in the golden waves of rice and heroes descending in the evening mist. Anhui and Hubei have achieved a good harvest of early rice. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Anhui Province are currently wielding sickles to harvest the early rice, while the early rice harvesting work in various parts of Hubei Province has basically come to an end.

	Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, August 4th: "Rejoice in the golden waves of rice and heroes descending in the evening mist." The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Anhui Province, filled with the joy of a bumper harvest, are currently wielding sickles to harvest the early rice. The eight million mu of early rice planted along the Yangtze River, the shores of Chaohu Lake, and the banks of the Xin'an River in the entire province has already been half harvested, with the yield generally higher than the bumper harvest of 1967.

	Anhui Province's early rice bumper harvest this year was seized from the jaws of the "drought tiger" by the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants armed with Mao Zedong Thought. The main rice-producing areas along the Yangtze River in the entire province suffered from drought threats from planting to harvesting due to the lack of rain and snow in the autumn and winter of last year and insufficient rainfall after the beginning of spring. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, remembering Chairman Mao's great teachings of "resolving to overcome all difficulties and win victory," fought against nature, transporting water from the Yangtze River and Chaohu Lake to irrigate the fields, ensuring the vigorous growth of the early rice.

	The ship sails with the helmsman, and the revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in Anhui Province, during the growth period of the early rice, followed the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, grasped the revolution, and vigorously promoted production, leading production with the revolution. Under the leadership of the newly established revolutionary committees and with the help of the People's Liberation Army's left support troops, they set up various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works and his latest series of instructions, effectively promoting the revolutionary transformation of people's thinking. The poor and lower-middle peasants in various places, remembering Chairman Mao's teachings of "never forget class struggle," took the fields and field edges as battlefields, deeply carried out revolutionary criticism, and severely criticized the "three selfs and one package," "responsibility fields," "four freedoms," and "work points as the leader" and other counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods pushed by China's Khrushchev and his agents in Anhui, effectively raising the awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, ensuring the high yield of early rice.

	Currently, the poor and lower-middle peasants in various places in Anhui are advancing in victory, harvesting while rushing to plant, determined to achieve an overall bumper harvest in agricultural production this year.

	Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, August 4th: Under the brilliant illumination of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and in the triumphant songs of the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Hubei Province, following the bumper harvest of summer grain this year, has again achieved a bumper harvest of early rice. Currently, the early rice harvesting work in various parts of Hubei has basically come to an end, and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and community members are doing everything possible to plant and plant well late rice and other late autumn crops, striving for an overall bumper harvest in agricultural production this year.

	This year's early rice bumper harvest in Hubei Province is a victory of Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp the revolution and promote production." Various levels of revolutionary committees, following Chairman Mao's great teachings of "never forget class struggle," led the broad revolutionary masses to launch a fierce attack on the class enemies, effectively striking down the evil plots of a handful of class enemies attempting to sabotage the revolution and production. Various levels of revolutionary committees also mobilized the broad revolutionary masses to deeply criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies of "class struggle extinguished," "exploitation has merit," "three selfs and one package," "four freedoms," and "material incentives" advocated by China's Khrushchev and his agent Wang Renhe in Hubei. In the revolutionary criticism, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, with problems in mind, actively learned and applied Mao Zedong Thought, greatly raising the awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, promoting the revolutionary transformation of people's thinking. Therefore, although this year's early rice production suffered from serious drought and flood threats, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres armed with Mao Zedong Thought, displaying a fearless revolutionary spirit, used the surging momentum released in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and applied it to agricultural production, overcoming difficulties, and finally achieving victory in both revolution and production.

　　喜看稻菽千重浪　遍地英雄下夕烟
　　安徽湖北早稻获得好收成
　　安徽省广大贫下中农正在挥镰收割，湖北省各地的收割工作已基本结束
    新华社合肥四日电  “喜看稻菽千重浪，遍地英雄下夕烟。”安徽省广大贫下中农怀着丰收的喜悦，正在挥镰收割早稻。全省播种在长江沿岸、巢湖湖滨和新安江畔的八百万亩早稻，已有一半收割完毕，产量普遍高过丰收的一九六七年。
    安徽省今年早稻丰收，是毛泽东思想武装起来的广大贫下中农从“旱老虎”口里夺得的。全省主要水稻产区的长江两岸，由于去年秋冬缺少雨雪，立春后雨水又不足，早稻从栽插到收割受到了干旱的威胁。广大贫下中农牢记毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的伟大教导，战天斗地，从长江、巢湖车水灌田，保证了早稻的茁壮生长。
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。安徽省广大贫下中农和革命干部，在早稻生长期间，遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，狠抓革命，猛促生产，以革命统帅生产。他们在新生的革命委员会的领导下和人民解放军支左部队的帮助下，办起各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，活学活用毛主席著作和毛主席的一系列最新指示，有力地促进了人的思想革命化。各地贫下中农牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，以田头、地边为战场，深入开展革命大批判，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在安徽的代理人所推行的“三自一包”、“责任田”、“四大自由”、“工分挂帅”等反革命修正主义黑货，有力地提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟，保证了早稻的丰产。
    目前，安徽各地贫下中农正在乘胜前进，边收割，边抢种，决心夺取今年农业生产的全面丰收。
    新华社武汉四日电在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，湖北省继今年夏粮丰收之后，早稻又喜获丰收。目前，湖北各地的早稻收割工作已经基本结束，广大贫下中农和社员群众正在千方百计地多种、种好晚稻和其他晚秋作物，为夺取今年农业生产的全面丰收而奋斗。
    今年湖北省早稻丰收，是毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针的胜利。各级革命委员会遵循毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，率领广大革命群众向阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻，有力地打击了一小撮阶级敌人妄图破坏革命和生产的罪恶阴谋。各级革命委员会还发动广大革命群众，深刻地批判了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在湖北的代理人王任重之流鼓吹的“阶级斗争熄灭”论、“剥削有功”、“三自一包”、“四大自由”、“物质刺激”等反革命修正主义谬论。在革命大批判中，广大贫下中农和革命干部带着问题活学活用毛泽东思想，大大提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟，促进了人的思想革命化。因此，今年早稻生产虽然遭到了严重的旱涝威胁，但是用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大贫下中农和革命干部，发扬大无畏的革命精神，把无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的冲天干劲用到农业生产上，战胜困难，终于取得了革命和生产的双胜利。
