	Chairman Mao and We Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Have a Close Bond
	National Agricultural Labor Model Worker, Shandong Province, Xin County, Dongdu Village Commune, Dongdu Village Brigade Leader, Old Poor Peasant Zeng Guangfu

	Just as we poor and lower-middle peasants are enthusiastically celebrating the second anniversary of Chairman Mao's "Bombard the Headquarters" big-character poster, we have received thrilling news from Beijing: Our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao has given the precious gift of mangoes, presented to him by foreign friends, to the workers, peasants, and soldiers of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams in the capital. This is Chairman Mao's greatest concern, greatest encouragement, and greatest motivation for us billions of workers, peasants, and soldiers. We shout a thousand times, ten thousand times: Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand, ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao!

	Father and mother are dear, but not as dear as Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao cares most about us poor and lower-middle peasants. In the old society, I was a beggar child who had to beg for food every day. A little older, I had to work for the landlords, toiling like an ox and a horse, without even a name. It was Chairman Mao who sent the revolutionary army—the Eighth Route Army—to liberate us from the oppression of the "three big mountains," making us "poor sticks" into the masters of the state. It is Chairman Mao who cares most about us poor and lower-middle peasants. He called on us to always hold the power, to organize and walk the socialist path of happiness and brightness for generations to come. Following Chairman Mao's teachings, in 1943 we organized mutual aid teams; later, we followed Chairman Mao in establishing agricultural cooperatives and people's communes. The collective economy has grown stronger, and both people's spiritual and natural landscapes have undergone earth-shaking changes. Take our Dongdu Village, for example. In the past, we feared both floods and droughts, and grain yields were always low. Since the cooperatives, we have dug more than ten wells; at the start of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, everyone's spirits were high, and we had even more enthusiasm. We dug eleven more wells, achieving irrigation for the entire village's more than three thousand mu of land. Last year, despite no heavy rains, we still achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, producing more than a million jin of grain, as well as a large amount of cotton, peanuts, and fruits. This spring, the drought was even more severe, but our more than a thousand mu of wheat still yielded an unusually good harvest.

	We poor and lower-middle peasants all know that our complete liberation, our happy lives, and our good harvests are all achieved under Chairman Mao's constant care. Especially at this critical juncture of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao has sent the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams to help us quickly implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, rapidly achieving revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination. The poor and lower-middle peasants and the broad masses of commune members have united as one, launching a new high tide of seizing the revolution and promoting production. We have countless words to express our boundless love and admiration for Chairman Mao.

	Chairman Mao always thinks of us poor and lower-middle peasants. Our millions of red hearts will forever be with the great leader Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao supports us, and we must make Chairman Mao proud. The sea may dry up, and the rocks may crumble, but our poor and lower-middle peasants' loyal hearts to follow Chairman Mao in revolution will never change! At this crucial moment of seizing the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, be infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We must closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, tightly unite around the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, under the orders of the proletarian headquarters, unify our will, unify our steps, and unify our actions. We must carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of "seizing the remaining courage to pursue the fleeing enemy," and with even greater determination than when fighting the Japanese devils and struggling against the landlord tyrants, we must fight to the end and expose the Chinese Khrushchev and all his big and small agents, and eliminate all the counter-revolutionary revisionist poison they have spread in the countryside! At the same time, we must do a good job of cleaning up the class ranks, rooting out all hidden counter-revolutionaries, consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, and achieving the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

　　毛主席和俺贫下中农心连心
　　全国农业劳动模范、山东省莘县董杜庄公社董杜庄大队负责人、老贫农  曾广福
    正当我们贫下中农热烈欢呼毛主席《炮打司令部》大字报发表两周年的时候，又从北京传来了振奋人心的特大喜讯：我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席把外国朋友赠送给他老人家的珍贵礼物——芒果，转送给了首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队。这是毛主席对我们亿万工农兵群众的最大关怀，最大鼓舞，最大鞭策。我们千遍万遍地高呼：毛主席万岁！万万岁！
    爹亲娘亲没有毛主席亲。毛主席对我们贫下中农最关心。在旧社会，我是个整天讨饭的穷孩子；稍大一点，就给地主扛活，给地主当牛当马，连个名字都没有。是毛主席他老人家派来了革命的队伍——八路军，把我们从“三座大山”的压迫下解放出来，使我们这些“穷棒子”成了国家的主人。是毛主席最关心我们贫下中农，他老人家叫我们永远掌住印把子，号召我们组织起来，千秋万代走社会主义的幸福的光明路。我们遵照毛主席的教导，在一九四三年组织起互助组；以后又紧跟毛主席，办起了农业合作社和人民公社。集体经济越来越壮大，人的精神面貌和自然面貌，都发生了天翻地覆的变化。拿俺董杜庄来说，过去怕涝又怕旱，粮食产量一直很低。合作化以来，俺先后打成机井十多眼；无产阶级文化大革命开始，大伙精神焕发，干劲更大，又一鼓作气，打成机井十一眼，使全庄三千多亩土地实现了水利化。去年一年，没下过透雨，可我们还是夺得了历史上没有过的大丰收，粮食打了上百万斤，还收获了大宗的棉花、花生和水果。今年春天，旱得更够呛，一千多亩小麦仍获得少有的好收成。
    我们贫下中农心里都明白，我们的彻底翻身，我们的幸福生活，我们的好收成，都是在毛主席时刻关怀下取得的。特别在无产阶级文化大革命的紧要关头，毛主席又派来了解放军毛泽东思想宣传队，帮助我们迅速落实了毛主席一系列最新指示，很快实现了革命大联合和革命三结合。贫下中农和广大社员拧成一股绳，掀起了抓革命促生产的新高潮。我们千言万语，说不尽对毛主席他老人家的无限热爱，无限崇拜。
    毛主席他老人家时刻想着俺贫下中农，我们贫下中农的千万颗红心，永远向着伟大领袖毛主席。毛主席他老人家为我们贫下中农撑腰，我们就要为毛主席争气。海可枯，石可烂，俺贫下中农跟着毛主席干革命的赤胆忠心永不变！在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的关键时刻，我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，紧紧团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的周围，在无产阶级司令部的号令下，统一意志，统一步伐，统一行动，发扬“宜将剩勇追穷寇”的彻底革命精神，拿出比当年打日本鬼子、斗地主恶霸更大的劲头，斗倒斗臭中国赫鲁晓夫及其大大小小的代理人，肃清他们在农村散布的一切反革命修正主义流毒！同时，要做好清理阶级队伍的工作，挖出一切暗藏的反革命分子，巩固无产阶级专政，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
