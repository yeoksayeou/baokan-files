The Shangzhuang Commune Hai Zi Production Brigade poor peasant member Zhang Chenghe, 68 years old and illiterate, harbored a deep loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. She overcame countless difficulties to study and apply Chairman Mao's works diligently. In just a few short months, she was able to read the "Three Articles" and memorize dozens of quotations. This spring festival, Old Madame Zhang visited her daughter's home. As soon as she entered the door, she rushed to the portrait of Chairman Mao, holding up a red copy of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong," first wishing Chairman Mao eternal life and shouting "Long live Chairman Mao ten thousand times!" Then, she greeted her daughter who had come to welcome her.

Old Madame Zhang said: "This time I came to see you, I didn't bring anything else, just brought you four volumes of Chairman Mao's precious books. Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeblood of us poor and lower-middle peasants. You must read Chairman Mao's books well and follow Chairman Mao to revolutionize for life!"
