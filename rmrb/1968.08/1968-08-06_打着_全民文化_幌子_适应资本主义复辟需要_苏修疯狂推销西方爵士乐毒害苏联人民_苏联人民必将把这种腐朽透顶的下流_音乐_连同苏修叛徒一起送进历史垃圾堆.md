Under the banner of "mass culture," the Soviet revisionist leadership is frantically promoting Western jazz music to numb the Soviet people and youth. This decadent and vulgar "music" is spreading like a plague in the Soviet Union, emitting a foul stench everywhere.

For many years, bourgeois jazz music has been prevalent in capitalist countries in Europe and America. It is a product of the dying, decadent monopoly capitalism and reflects the decline of bourgeois culture. During the period when Stalin led the Soviet Union, the tendency of some Soviet composers to accept the influence of this decadent Western bourgeois music was repeatedly criticized by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks). However, after the Soviet revisionist leadership usurped power in the Soviet Party and state, they blatantly promoted the decadent Western jazz music to restore capitalism in the Soviet Union. They openly advocated for jazz music to become a part of the lives of young people. In 1962, they invited an American jazz band to perform in the Soviet Union as a "demonstration." At that time, the great traitor Khrushchev personally attended the first visit of the American jazz band to the Soviet Union and expressed his "appreciation" for it. Under the promotion of Khrushchev and his ilk, that same autumn, the Soviet revisionist "Komsomol" and the Moscow branch of the Soviet revisionist Composers' Union jointly organized the first Moscow Jazz Music Festival, formalizing the promotion of decadent music through the festival.

After the Brezhnev and Kosygin clique came to power, they further brazenly promoted Western jazz music. Under the banner of "cultural exchange," they annually invited a large number of jazz bands from Western nightclubs to perform in various parts of the Soviet Union, and sent people to participate in "international competitions" to learn from Western bands. Thus, various "schools" of jazz bands, such as the "pure" school, "classical" school, "avant-garde" school, "supermodern" school, "Russian" school, American-style "Elvis Presley" bands, and British-style "Beatles" bands, all emerged in the Soviet Union.

To promote decadent jazz music, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique mobilized the propaganda machine and organized reactionary authorities in the music world to loudly praise this poison from the Western world. The Soviet revisionist Central Television started a series called "Yesterday and Today of Jazz" last December, holding one session per month, and by June this year, they had held seven sessions, vigorously promoting decadent Western jazz music and shamelessly claiming that it is a "sacred music." Since this year, Brezhnev, Kosygin, and their ilk have successively held jazz music festivals in seven cities, including Kuibyshev, Tallinn, Novosibirsk, Vilnius, and Moscow, vigorously promoting this vulgar music and poisoning and numbing the Soviet people.

With the strong support and encouragement of the Soviet revisionist leadership, Western jazz music has now become rampant in the Soviet Union. According to Soviet revisionist publications, "now in the Soviet Union, even the most unexpected places have jazz performance groups." "Jazz music is prevalent in films, radio, and television programs. Every scene of a documentary, every production program of television news is accompanied by jazz music, and jazz music permeates life."

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "In the present world, all culture or literature and art belong to a certain class and a certain political line." The Soviet revisionist traitors have been frantically promoting Western jazz music in the Soviet Union for many years, entirely to adapt to their political needs and to serve their counter-revolutionary revisionist line of restoring capitalism in the Soviet Union and maintaining imperialist and colonialist rule in the capitalist world.

The Soviet revisionist traitor clique's evil deeds of promoting decadent jazz music have aroused strong indignation among the Soviet people. Recently, a woman in a letter to a newspaper denounced that jazz music had caused her son to "go astray" and "become a victim of jazz." A school band leader condemned the jazz music prevalent in the Soviet Union as "a chaotic mix of arbitrary notes with no rules," saying it is like "vulgar language that harms life." A resident of Gorky City, Frasov, advocated for "eliminating jazz music from life." It is certain that the Soviet people will one day send the decadent jazz music along with the Soviet revisionist traitors who peddle these black goods into the garbage heap of history.

　　打着“全民文化”幌子　适应资本主义复辟需要
　　苏修疯狂推销西方爵士乐毒害苏联人民
    苏联人民必将把这种腐朽透顶的下流“音乐”连同苏修叛徒一起送进历史垃圾堆
    新华社讯　莫斯科消息：苏修领导集团打着“全民文化”的幌子，正在苏联疯狂地推销西方爵士乐，麻醉苏联人民和青年。现在，这种腐朽下流的“音乐”象瘟疫一样在苏联蔓延，到处散发着冲天的臭气。
    多年来在欧美资本主义国家盛行的资产阶级爵士乐，完全是垂死的、腐朽的垄断资本主义的产物，它反映了资产阶级文化的衰亡。在斯大林领导苏联的时期，在苏联某些作曲家中出现过的接受西方资产阶级这种颓废音乐影响的倾向，曾经多次受到联共（布）中央的批判。但是，苏修领导集团在篡夺了苏联党和国家的大权以后，为了在苏联复辟资本主义，却明目张胆地为腐朽透顶的西方爵士乐招魂，把它捧上了天，为它在苏联的泛滥大开方便之门，公开叫嚷要“让爵士乐成为青年人生活的一部分”。一九六二年，他们就邀请美国爵士乐队到苏联作“示范”演出。当时，大叛徒赫鲁晓夫亲自出马为第一次访苏的美国爵士乐队捧场，并表示“很欣赏它”。在赫鲁晓夫之流的推动下，同年秋天苏修“共青团”和苏修作曲家协会莫斯科分会主办了第一届莫斯科爵士音乐节，竟然把推销靡靡之音用音乐节的形式固定下来。
    勃列日涅夫、柯西金集团上台后，进一步肆无忌惮地推销西方爵士乐。他们打着“文化交流”的旗号，每年除了重金礼聘大量西方夜总会的爵士乐队到苏联各地放毒，还派人参加“国际比赛”，向西方乐队“取经”。于是，各种“流派”的爵士乐队，什么“纯粹派”、“古典派”、“先锋派”、“超现代派”、“俄罗斯派”，什么美国式的“猫王”乐队、英国式的“甲壳虫”乐队，在苏联纷纷出笼。
    为了推销腐朽的爵士乐，苏修叛徒集团开动宣传机器，并且组织音乐界的反动权威出来大张旗鼓地吹捧这种来自西方世界的毒品。苏修中央电视台从去年十二月开始搞了一个叫作“爵士乐的昨天与今天”的讲座，每月一讲，到今年六月已经举行了七次，竭力宣扬腐朽的西方爵士乐，恬不知耻地说什么它是一种“神圣的音乐”。今年以来，勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流还先后在古比雪夫、塔林、新西伯利亚、维尔纽斯、莫斯科等七个城市举行了乌烟瘴气的“爵士音乐节”，空前起劲地推广这种下流的音乐，毒害和麻痹苏联人民。
    在苏修领导集团的大力支持和鼓励下，西方爵士乐现在在苏联已经泛滥成灾。据苏修报刊透露，“现在在苏联，就连最想不到的地方也都有爵士乐演奏团体”。“爵士乐大量充斥在电影、广播和电视节目中，纪录片的每个情节，电视新闻的每个生产节目都要伴随爵士乐，爵士乐充满在生活中”。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席指出：“在现在世界上，一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。”苏修叛徒们多年来拚命在苏联推广西方爵士乐，完全是适应他们的政治需要，为他们在苏联复辟资本主义、在资本主义世界维护帝国主义和殖民主义统治的反革命修正主义路线服务的。
    苏修叛徒集团千方百计推销腐朽的爵士乐的罪恶勾当，激起了苏联人民的强烈愤慨。不久前，一位妇女在给报纸的一封信中，控诉爵士乐使她的儿子“离开了正道”，“成了爵士乐的牺牲品”。一个学校的乐队队长谴责在苏联流行的爵士乐是“没有任何规则的任意音符的混乱杂烩”，它象“下流话一样，妨害生活”。高尔基市的一个居民弗拉索夫主张，“把爵士乐从生活中清除出去”。可以肯定，苏联人民总有一天会把腐朽的爵士乐连同贩卖这些黑货的苏修叛徒，一起送进历史的垃圾堆。
