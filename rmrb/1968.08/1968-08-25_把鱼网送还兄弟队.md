The militiamen of Dai Jia Village Production Brigade in Shi Jiu People's Commune, Rizhao County, Shandong Province, once went fishing and found a large fishing net belonging to another village. According to the old regulations of the fisheries department, whoever lost the net had to pay thirty yuan to get it back, which was then distributed among the fishermen who found it, supposedly as "labor compensation." This time, should they ask for money for the net? The fishermen had different opinions. The brigade leadership decided to let everyone discuss the matter to educate the people.

Someone said with "reason": "Paying money to get the net back is the old rule, not something we thought of, so we can't cancel it." Someone immediately refuted, "Whether it's someone else's idea or not, it's still a wrong way, not the right way, and we can't follow it!" Then someone stood up and said, "Thirty yuan is too much, but on the other hand, we also worked hard to retrieve the net, so we should get some compensation, I think fifteen yuan would be appropriate!"

However, most of the militiamen said they shouldn't take the money, saying that taking money from others is putting the bourgeois "self" first, and it's disloyal to Chairman Mao. Deputy Militia Squad Leader Liu Shifu said, "We always talk about being selfless and dedicated to the collective, but if we take money from others' collective and put it in our own pockets, what kind of thing is that? Isn't that embezzling public funds for personal gain?" Then someone said, "We should turn it over to the brigade!"

"That's not right!" The speaker was Militia Company Commander Wang Fengren. He continued, "Chairman Mao teaches us to 'completely dedicate ourselves to others and not to ourselves,' we can't dedicate ourselves to others and not to ourselves. Besides, this regulation is obviously 'money first'! In the past, China's Khrushchev and his agents pushed 'money first,' 'fishing with labor,' 'boat to the household,' and ruined our collective. Now that we've gotten rid of those tricks and followed Mao Zedong Thought, the result is that our boats and nets are new, and production has increased greatly. Today, our brigade alone has over twenty thousand yuan in collective reserves. Can 'money first' achieve this? We can't let 'money' confuse our minds!" Militia Political Instructor Dai Wanwen added, "Right! That kind of thought that doesn't move without money is a real capitalist thought. 'Money' first is 'self' first, 'revisionism' first. Thirty yuan is a small matter, but the road we take is a big matter." Militia Squad Leader Dai Ruoxiang also excitedly said, "Everyone remembers, right? A few days ago, our brigade suffered a hailstorm, and the neighboring brigade sent people with oxen to help us farm, and they didn't even eat a meal with us. Their style is so high! This time we found a net and want to take money from them, what kind of thought is this, what kind of style? This is not something we poor and lower-middle peasants should do. I think we not only shouldn't take money, but if they have difficulties, we should also send them a few nets and boats to help, that's in line with Mao Zedong Thought."

Through the discussion, everyone reached a consensus that they absolutely couldn't take a single cent from them, and decided to dry the fishing net well, tidy it up, and send it to the brotherly brigade.

The next day, everyone was tidying up the fishing net, preparing to send it off, when the brotherly brigade sent someone over. As soon as they arrived, they took out money, but everyone said, "We want the spirit of communism, Mao Zedong Thought, not money." The visitors were very grateful and expressed their thanks. As they talked, everyone gathered around to help the brotherly brigade tie up the net and load it onto the car. Amidst the resounding song "Father and mother are not as dear as Chairman Mao... The river is deep, the sea is deep, but not as deep as class love," the fishing net was handed over to the people from the brotherly brigade.

    把鱼网送还兄弟队
    山东省日照县石臼公社代家村大队的民兵，有一天外出打鱼，拾到别村的一条大鱼网。按照过去水产部门的规定：谁丢了网，领网时要出三十元钱，交给拾网的渔工分用，说这叫“劳力补贴”。这次拾到鱼网要不要人家的钱呢？渔工们议论纷纷。大队领导班子觉得应该把这件事交给大家讨论，以便人们从中受到教育。
    有人满有“理由”地说：“交钱领网这是老规矩，也不是咱自己想的门道，不能取消。”有人马上反驳道：“不管是谁想的门道，反正是歪门邪道，不是正道，咱们不能走！”这时有人站起来说：“要人家三十元钱是太多了，可话又说回来，咱捞网也费了一大把力，少要点补贴也应该，我看要十五元吧！”
    但是，大多数民兵都说不能要，要人家钱是资产阶级的“私”字当头，是对毛主席的不忠。民兵副班长刘世福说：“咱们成天讲要大公无私，要一心为集体，可是咱们要人家集体的钱装在个人的腰包里，这是啥名堂？这不是损公肥私吗？”这时又有人说：“咱们不好归大队吗！”
    “那也不行！”发言的是民兵连长王丰仁。他继续说：“毛主席教导咱们要‘毫不利己专门利人’，咱可不能专门利己，毫不利人。再说，这种规定很明显是‘金钱挂帅’么！过去中国赫鲁晓夫和他的代理人在咱村大搞‘金钱挂帅’、‘以工代鱼’、‘包船到户’，弄得咱集体精光。现在去掉那些鬼名堂，用毛泽东思想挂帅，结果船网一挂新，产量大增加，今天咱大队光集体储备金就两万多元。‘金钱挂帅’能‘挂’成这样吗？咱可不能叫‘钱’迷了心窍啊！”民兵政治指导员代万文接着说：“对么！那种离了钱不转悠的思想是实打实的资本主义思想，‘钱’字当头就是‘私’字当头，‘修’字当头。三十元钱是小事，走什么道路可是大事。”民兵班长代若祥也激动地说：“大伙没忘吧，前些日子咱大队遭了雹灾，邻近兄弟队派人带牛支援咱们种地，连顿饭都不吃咱的，人家的风格多高！这回咱拾条网就想要人家的钱，这到底是啥思想，啥风格？这不是咱贫下中农应该作的事。我看咱不光不能要钱，要是人家有困难，还应当把咱们的鱼网送几副去，把咱们的船开去帮助，这才符合毛泽东思想。”
    通过讨论，大伙统一了认识，决不能要人家一分一文，并决定：要把鱼网晒得好好的，拾掇得干干净净的，给兄弟队送去。
    第二天，大伙正在拾掇鱼网，准备送去，这时，兄弟队来人了，他们一到就掏钱，大伙说：“俺要的是共产主义风格，毛泽东思想，不是钱。”来人很感激，表示谢意。说着说着大家都围上去帮助兄弟队捆网装车。在一片“爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲……河深海深不如阶级友爱深”的宏亮歌声中，把鱼网交给兄弟队的人带走了。
