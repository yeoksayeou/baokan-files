“Chairman Mao's orders are my commands, Chairman Mao's path is my path to run.”

Two years ago, our great leader Chairman Mao issued the great battle call to bombard the headquarters of the bourgeoisie. Billions of revolutionary masses brandished the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, smashed the headquarters of the bourgeoisie led by China's Khrushchev, and foiled the plot of the class enemy to restore capitalism, achieving decisive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Two years ago, China's Khrushchev and his agents in Jiangsu and Hai'an regions were rampantly pushing the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, brutally suppressing our revolutionary movement of the militia and the masses in Jiaoqiao. At this critical moment, our great commander Chairman Mao published the big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters." Upon hearing Chairman Mao's great call, we were overjoyed and invigorated! With boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, we carried forward the spirit of revolutionary rebellion, daring to pull the emperor off his horse. We launched a fierce counterattack against the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, steadfastly aiming our cannons at a handful of capitalist-roaders, and defeated the class enemy's repeated counterattacks. We successfully established the revolutionary committee of the commune.

After the establishment of the commune revolutionary committee, we, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, carried out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism and struggle. We conducted a thorough and systematic criticism of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and their agents in Jiangsu and Hai'an regions. At the same time, we dug deep into their social base in Jiaoqiao, exposing a handful of traitors, spies, and unrepentant landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. In the course of revolutionary criticism and the work of purging the class ranks, the broad masses of militia and poor and lower-middle peasants significantly heightened their class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness, submerging the class enemies in the vast ocean of the revolutionary masses.

Over the past two years, our militia and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have undergone repeated tempering in the struggle between the two classes and the two lines. We have truly achieved: "Chairman Mao's orders are my commands, Chairman Mao's path is my path to run." We resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's instructions, persistently hold various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, taking "criticize and repudiate revisionism and the bourgeois reactionary line" as the key link. We repeatedly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, continuously promote the revolutionization of thought, and continuously expand the achievements of "grasp revolution, promote production." Although 1967 experienced a severe drought unprecedented in the past forty years, the production of cotton and grain still surpassed any previous year. This year's summer grain harvest increased by more than ten percent compared to last year.

Under the guidance of the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao, after more than two years of struggle, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victory. The headquarters of the bourgeoisie led by China's Khrushchev, along with its social base, has collapsed. However, China's Khrushchev and his agents in Jiangsu and Hai'an regions are not reconciled to their defeat. They are watching for opportunities, waiting for a chance to strike. We are determined to raise higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, further launch a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, unite all forces that can be united, and continue to launch attacks on China's Khrushchev and a handful of class enemies, thoroughly criticizing, exposing, and overthrowing them politically, ideologically, and theoretically! We will fight to build a new socialist countryside red with Mao Zedong Thought!

　　“毛主席有令我就行，毛主席指路我飞奔”
　　江苏省海安县角斜人民公社革委会主任角斜“红旗民兵团”政治委员  蔡元祥
    两年前，伟大的领袖毛主席向我们发出了炮打资产阶级司令部的伟大战斗号令，亿万革命群众奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，摧毁了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，粉碎了阶级敌人复辟资本主义的阴谋，夺取了无产阶级文化大革命决定性的胜利。
    两年前，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在江苏、海安地区的代理人，猖狂推行资产阶级反动路线，疯狂镇压我们角斜民兵和群众的革命运动。正在这时，我们伟大的统帅毛主席发表了《炮打司令部》的大字报。听了毛主席的伟大号召，我们是何等高兴，何等振奋啊！我们民兵和革命群众怀着对毛主席的无限忠诚，发扬“舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马”的革命造反精神，向资产阶级反动路线猛烈反击，坚定不移地把炮口对准一小撮走资派，击败了阶级敌人一次又一次的反扑，胜利地建立了公社革命委员会。
    公社革命委员会成立以后，我们又在毛主席的一系列最新指示的指引下，深入持久地开展革命大批判，对党内最大的一小撮走资派和他们在江苏、海安地区的代理人进行了深刻的系统的批判，同时大挖他们在角斜地区的社会基础，把一小撮叛徒、特务和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子揭露了出来。在革命大批判和清理阶级队伍工作中，广大民兵和贫下中农阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟大大提高，阶级敌人陷入革命群众运动的汪洋大海之中。
    两年来，我们角斜民兵和广大贫下中农在两个阶级、两条路线的斗争中，经受了一次又一次的锻炼，真正做到了：“毛主席有令我就行，毛主席指路我飞奔”。我们坚决执行毛主席的指示，坚持不懈地举办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，以“斗私，批修”为纲，反复落实毛主席的最新指示，不断促进思想革命化，不断扩大“抓革命，促生产”的战果。一九六七年虽然遇到四十多年来没有过的连续干旱，棉花和粮食的产量却超过了历史上任何一年。今年夏粮收成又比去年增产一成以上。
    在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，经过两年多的斗争，无产阶级文化大革命已经取得了决定性的胜利，以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部连同它的社会基础已经土崩瓦解。但是，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在江苏、海安地区的代理人并不甘心他们的失败。他们正在窥测方向，等待时机，以求一逞。我们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，进一步掀起活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，团结一切可以团结的力量，继续向中国赫鲁晓夫等一小撮阶级敌人发起进攻，坚决把他们从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底批深、批透、批倒、批臭！为建设一个红彤彤的毛泽东思想新农村而战斗！
