	The humble are the wisest! The noble are the most foolish!

	In the early hours of August 15, Chairman Mao's latest directive:
	"Our country has 700 million people. The working class is the leading class. We must fully exert the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work. The working class must also continuously raise its political consciousness in the struggle." Swiftly spread throughout the steel capital, greatly inspiring the people of Anshan. Qian Lianfa, an old worker who has been fighting against the biggest bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities" in Anshan Steel for many years, heard Chairman Mao's latest directive and was extremely moved. Holding the Red Book, facing Chairman Mao's portrait, he repeatedly shouted: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!

	Qian Lianfa, this old worker who has always acted according to Chairman Mao's directives, is a forger at Anshan Steel's Third Steel Plant. Ten years ago, he saw that the steel water tank pressure rod machine often could not control the steel water, welding the casting car, mold, and transport track. Several technical "authorities" watched helplessly. In 1959, Qian Lianfa organized some old workers, determined to tackle this "tiger's ass."

	Several bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities" heard that the workers were going to carry out a technological revolution, shaking their heads like rattles, and fundamentally did not believe that the working class could come up with anything. When Qian Lianfa and some workers came up with a technological innovation plan, those technical "authorities" who relied on books for a living didn't even look at it and colluded with the capitalist roaders within the party to impose bourgeois dictatorship on the working masses, burying the innovation plan in the cold palace.

	In 1963, the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries launched an anti-China chorus, and the Chinese Khrushchev and their agents in various places responded in kind, stirring up a storm of capitalist restoration. The wheel of history cannot be reversed, and the revolutionary fire will never die out. With our great leader Chairman Mao at the helm, a few buzzing flies cannot stop the working class from moving forward. At this time, Qian Lianfa and some old workers, with their boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, continuously came up with four innovation plans. They said: Producing one more furnace of steel is a heavy blow to the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries, and a powerful support for the world revolution! They selected an "external upper plug head" plan and submitted it to the relevant departments for trial.

	The few bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities" who were praised to the skies by a small group of capitalist roaders within Anshan Steel put on the airs of bourgeois lords and said: "Old Qian, we've looked at your plan, but we've checked the data for more than 20 days. This thing doesn't exist in our country or abroad and cannot be tested." Qian Lianfa retorted: "According to your logic, we have to forever follow behind foreigners and never surpass them?" A reactionary technical "authority" sneered: "Scientific experiments are not a joke, let's talk about reason." Old Qian said firmly: The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: 'The Chinese people have the spirit, have the ability, and will definitely catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level in the not-too-distant future.' As long as we have Mao Zedong Thought, we can create everything!" The few reactionary technical "authorities" were speechless and slunk away.

	In 1965, Qian Lianfa came to the Steel Research Institute. The biggest bourgeois reactionary technical "authority" in Anshan Steel looked at the drawings and said with ulterior motives: "Old Qian, you are a forger, what are you doing with this?" Old Qian said resolutely: "For the construction of socialism! For supporting the world people's revolution!" The reactionary technical "authority" blinked, as if he didn't understand Old Qian's words, and asked again: "Do you know what materials are needed for this? What instruments to measure? How to calculate?" Old Qian heard this and his heart burned with anger: "What you say is nothing special, we know, but we, the working class, know even more about self-reliance and striving for progress, fighting for Chairman Mao's honor!" The big "authority" threatened: "I've been working on this for a few years, using an electric motor to drive it and it didn't work, your drawing is still using manual operation, can that work!" Old Qian said: "Without experimentation, no conclusions can be drawn, we are determined to succeed!"

	The working class is the most thorough in revolution. Old Qian and his comrades, in their fierce struggle against the bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities" and the capitalist roaders within the party, overcame numerous difficulties and repeatedly experimented, achieving one success after another.

	The steel water tank pressure rod machine, facing the storms of class struggle, was about to be born.

	Hearing that the first furnace of steel was about to be tested, Anshan Steel's biggest bourgeois reactionary technical "authority" swayed down from the building, standing far away to watch the show. Qian Lianfa, this experienced old worker, with a heart full of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, skillfully controlled the steelmaking technology. Just as the crane lifted the steel tank above the steel ingot mold, Old Qian turned the plug handle, effortlessly opening the steel tank mouth, and the steel water poured down like a fire dragon. The myth that the reactionary technical "authority" could not open the steel tank mouth with an electric motor was completely shattered! The workers' hearts bloomed like steel flowers, and the excitement surged, the cheers thundered. The revolutionary workers' cheers hit the heads of the small group of reactionary technical "authorities" like cannonballs, and that biggest bourgeois reactionary technical "authority" in Anshan Steel shrank his neck like a defeated rooster, not daring to make a sound.

	Qian Lianfa, who had been a pig herder and laborer for the landlord since he was young, was considered by the bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities" to be "ignorant" of everything. In the battlefield of scientific experiments, he won victory after victory, and the good news came frequently; those "noble" figures who thought they were great made a fool of themselves on the road of scientific experiments and fell flat on their faces. Just as our great teacher Chairman Mao pointed out, "The humble are the wisest! The noble are the most foolish!"

    卑贱者最聪明！高贵者最愚蠢
    八月十五日凌晨，毛主席的最新指示：
  “我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”迅速传遍钢都，极大地鼓舞了鞍山广大军民。同鞍钢最大的资产阶级反动技术“权威”斗争多年的老工人钱连发，听到毛主席的最新指示，心情无比激动，手捧红色宝书，面对着毛主席像不断高呼：毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！
    钱连发这个一贯按照毛主席指示办事的老工人，是鞍钢第三炼钢厂的锻工。十年前，他看见控制钢水流止的钢水罐压棒机常常控制不住钢水，焊了铸车、模子和运输铁道，一些技术“权威”眼看着却没办法。一九五九年，钱连发串连了一些老工人，决心要摸一摸这个“老虎屁股”。
    几个资产阶级反动技术“权威”，听说工人们要搞技术革命，脑袋晃得象拨浪鼓一样，压根儿就不相信工人阶级能搞出什么名堂。当钱连发和一些工人搞出技术革新方案时，那几个光靠书本吃饭的技术“权威”连看都不看，就同党内走资派串通一气，对工人群众实行资产阶级专政，把革新方案打入了冷宫。
    一九六三年，帝、修、反掀起反华大合唱，中国赫鲁晓夫和他们在各地的代理人也遥相呼应，刮起了一股复辟资本主义的妖风。历史的车轮不容倒转，革命的烈火永远不灭。有我们伟大领袖毛主席掌舵，几只嗡嗡叫的苍蝇，丝毫阻挡不住工人阶级前进的步伐。就在这时候，钱连发和一些老工人怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限忠诚的无产阶级感情，连续搞出四个革新方案。他们说：多炼一炉钢，就是对帝、修、反的沉重打击，也是对世界革命的有力支援！他们选定一个“外上塞头”方案，报送有关部门，准备进行试验。
    被鞍钢党内一小撮走资派捧上了天的几个资产阶级反动技术“权威”，摆出了一副资产阶级老爷的架势说：“老钱，你们的那个方案我们看了，可是我们查了二十多天资料，这个东西我们国家没有，外国也没有，根本不能进行试验。”钱连发反问道：“照你们的意思，我们得永远跟着外国人屁股后面爬行，不能超过他们啦？”一个反动的技术“权威”阴险地说：“科学实验不是开玩笑，你讲讲道理看？”老钱理直气壮地说：伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“‘中国人民有志气，有能力，一定要在不远的将来，赶上和超过世界先进水平。’只要有毛泽东思想，我们就能创造一切！”几个反动技术“权威”被老钱说得哑口无言，灰溜溜地溜走了。
    一九六五年，钱连发来到钢铁研究所。那个鞍钢最大的资产阶级反动技术“权威”望着图纸，别有用心地说：“老钱，你是一个锻工，搞这个东西干什么？”老钱斩钉截铁地说：“为了建设社会主义！为了支援世界人民革命！”反动技术“权威”眨眨眼，好象不理解老钱的话，又问道：“你搞这个东西知道需要什么材料？用什么仪器测量？知道怎样计算吗？”老钱一听，心中的火不打一处来：“你们说的那一套，没啥了不起的，我们都知道，但是，我们工人阶级更知道自力更生，奋发图强，为毛主席争气！”大“权威”又威胁道：“我搞了几年了，用电动机带动都没有成功，你的图纸搞的还是用手开动，那能行吗！”老钱说：“没有试验，下不得断言，反正我们有决心搞成功！”
    工人阶级最富于革命的彻底性。老钱他们在和资产阶级反动技术“权威”和党内走资派激烈斗争中，克服重重困难，反复实验，取得了一个又一个的成绩。
    钢水罐压棒机迎着阶级斗争的风雨就要诞生了。
    听说要试出第一炉钢，鞍钢那个最大的资产阶级反动技术“权威”从大楼上晃荡下来，远远地站在一旁准备看笑话。钱连发这个有着丰富经验的老工人，凭着一颗对伟大领袖毛主席无限忠诚的红心，熟练地掌握着出钢技术。吊车刚把钢罐吊到钢锭模上方时，老钱转动堵头把手，没费劲就把钢罐口打开了，钢水象一条火龙倾泻下来，反动技术“权威”用电动机都不能打开钢罐口的神话彻底破产了！工人们的心象钢花一样盛开怒放，顿时群情振奋，欢声雷动。革命职工的欢呼声象炮弹一样重重地打在一小撮反动技术“权威”的脑袋上，那个鞍钢最大的资产阶级反动技术“权威”象斗败了的公鸡一样，缩着脖子不敢吭声了。
    从小就给地主放猪扛活的钱连发，被资产阶级反动技术“权威”认为“什么也不懂”的普通工人，在科学实验的战场上连打胜仗，捷报频传；那些自以为了不起的“高贵”人物却在科学实验道路上出尽洋相，连栽跟头。正如我们伟大导师毛主席指出的“卑贱者最聪明！高贵者最愚蠢”！　鞍革新　向东兵
