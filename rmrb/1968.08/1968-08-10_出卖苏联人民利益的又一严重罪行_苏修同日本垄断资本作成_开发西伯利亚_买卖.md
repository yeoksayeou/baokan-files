The Soviet revisionist renegade clique is colluding more closely with the reactionary Sato government of Japan, shamelessly selling out national sovereignty to open the door wide for Japanese monopoly capital to plunder the resources of Siberia.

According to reports, the Soviet revisionist renegade clique and the Japanese monopoly capital group held negotiations in Tokyo on the "development of Siberian forests" starting from late June this year. On July 29, they reached an agreement and signed the basic contract.

According to the contract, Japan will provide machinery and equipment worth 163 million US dollars for "developing the forests" to the Soviet Union starting next year, with a five-year deferred payment. In return, the Soviet Union will provide 8.02 million cubic meters of timber to Japan over five years.

The Soviet revisionist clique has long shamelessly proposed welcoming Japanese monopoly capital to invest in the "development" of Siberia. Last June, a delegation from the Japanese monopoly capital group participated in the "Japan-Soviet Economic Joint Conference" held in Moscow, discussing the issue of "joint development" of Siberia. Within just one year, a concrete deal was reached. The Japanese newspaper *Economic News* said, "The pace at which the agreement was reached was surprisingly fast," and that this marks the "beginning of a new economic cooperation relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union."

A representative of Japanese monopoly capital boasted at the signing ceremony: "The significance of this first shot is great," and that in the future, "cooperation between Japanese monopoly capital and the Soviet revisionist clique in the development of Siberia will expand further."

The Sato government of Japan, in order to further entice the Soviet revisionist clique and realize its sinister plan to infiltrate Siberia, decided to export fiber products and other consumer goods to the Soviet Union on a deferred payment basis. According to an official from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Japanese government is doing this because "in the near future, Siberia will not only be an important market for production materials for Japan but also for consumer goods."

The Soviet revisionist clique betrays the interests of the Soviet people, trading national sovereignty for filthy deals with Japanese reactionaries, once again exposing its traitorous face to the people of the world.

### 出卖苏联人民利益的又一严重罪行　苏修同日本垄断资本作成“开发西伯利亚”买卖

　　出卖苏联人民利益的又一严重罪行
　　苏修同日本垄断资本作成“开发西伯利亚”买卖
    据新华社讯　东京消息：苏修叛徒集团同日本佐藤反动政府加紧勾结，不惜出卖国家主权，为日本垄断资本掠夺西伯利亚资源，大开方便之门。
    据报道，苏修叛徒集团同日本垄断资本集团之间从今年六月下旬起在东京举行了关于“开发西伯利亚森林”的谈判，并在七月二十九日达成协议，在基本合同上签了字划了押。
    根据这个合同，日本从明年起以五年延期付款方式向苏联提供价值一亿六千三百万美元的“开发森林用的”机器和器材；而苏联方面作为回头货，在五年内向日本提供八百零二万立方米的木材。
    苏修集团很早就恬不知耻地提出欢迎日本垄断资本投资“开发”西伯利亚的计划。去年六月，日本垄断资本集团曾派出一个代表团参加在莫斯科举行的“日苏经济联席会议”，讨论了“共同开发”西伯利亚问题。事隔仅一年就达成了具体交易。日本《经济新闻》说，“（双方）达成协议的步伐如此之快，出乎意料”，从此“日苏之间产生了新的经济合作关系”。
    日本垄断资本的一个代表在签字仪式后，得意忘形地叫嚷：“这个第一炮的意义很大”，今后在“开发西伯利亚方面”，日本垄断资本同苏修集团的“合作将会更加扩大”。
    日本佐藤政府为了进一步钓苏修集团的胃口，实现它向西伯利亚大举渗透的不可告人的企图，决定以延期付款方式，向苏联出口纤维制品等消费物资。据日本政府外务省官员透露，日本政府所以这样做，是“因为在最近的将来，西伯利亚不仅在生产资料方面，而且在消费资料方面也有很大可能成为日本的重要市场”。
    苏修集团背叛苏联人民的利益，拿国家主权同日本反动派做肮脏的交易，从而在世界人民面前，又一次暴露了它的叛徒真面目。
