Lao patriotic forces annihilate a large number of bandits

Guerrillas in Vientiane Province blow up a major bridge on Route 13

	New Xinhua News Agency, Kengkay, August 12th

	According to a broadcast by the Pathet Lao radio station: On July 26th, local forces and guerrillas in Oudomxay County, Luang Prabang Province, intercepted bandits reinforcing the Long Bamboo area. They killed 32 bandits on the spot, and the remaining bandits fled in disarray. In the pursuit of the fleeing enemy, the patriotic armed forces annihilated another 42 bandits.

	At the same time, the patriotic armed forces also seized 34 weapons and a batch of military supplies, liberating four villages.

	The broadcast said that the above victories, along with the glorious achievements of annihilating more than 500 bandits in Phonsavan, Sam Neua, and Oudomxay provinces in June and July, are heavy blows to the U.S. imperialists' plot to use their "special forces" to sabotage the liberated areas of Laos.

	According to another report from the Pathet Lao News Agency, on July 12th, guerrillas in the Banang area southeast of the capital of Phonsavan Province set up a trap and captured 30 bandits trained by the Americans, seizing a batch of weapons.

	On the same day, guerrillas in the Xongmou and Yangtao areas annihilated 13 bandits hiding in the jungle.

	On the evening of August 2nd, guerrillas in Vientiane Province blew up a major bridge on Route 13 near Ban Sene. This is the ninth bridge destroyed by the Lao patriotic armed forces since November last year. These bridges are almost all on the enemy's most important strategic road—Route 13.

　　老挝爱国武装歼灭大批匪徒
　　万象省游击队炸毁十三号公路上敌人的一座大桥
    新华社康开十二日电　据巴特寮电台广播：老挝琅勃拉邦省乌多姆塞县的地方部队和游击队，七月二十六日截击到龙竹等地区增援的匪徒，当场打死三十二名匪徒，残匪仓惶逃窜。在追击残敌的战斗中，爱国武装力量又歼灭匪徒四十二名。
    同时，爱国武装力量还缴获武器三十四件以及军用物资一批，解放了四个村庄。
    广播说，上述胜利，同丰沙里、桑怒、乌多姆塞省六月和七月份歼匪五百多名的辉煌战果，是对美帝国主义利用它的“特种部队”破坏老挝解放区的阴谋的沉重打击。
    另据巴特寮通讯社报道，丰沙里省会东南巴南地区的游击队七月十二日设置陷阱，俘虏美国豢养的匪徒三十名，缴获武器一批。
    同一天，宗万和阳太地区的游击队歼灭躲在丛林中的十三名匪徒。
    万象省游击队八月二日晚上炸毁北汕附近十三号公路上的一座大桥。这是自去年十一月以来老挝爱国武装力量炸毁敌人的第九座大桥，这些桥几乎都是在敌人最重要的战略公路——十三号公路上。
