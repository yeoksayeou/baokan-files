The U.S. imperialists, through the military dictatorship they have propped up in Argentina, have intensified their plunder and exploitation of Argentina over the past two years, leading to a significant deterioration of the Argentine economy and worsening living conditions for the people.

Since the Onganía regime came to power, the U.S. imperialists and the international financial institutions under their control have directed it to further implement economic and social policies that sell out national interests. This has allowed U.S. monopoly capital to more viciously plunder the country's resources and exploit the Argentine people, deepening Argentina's colonial status.

According to official Argentine reports, in the first seventeen months after the dictatorship took power, foreign capital's direct investment in Argentina increased by 188% compared to the seventeen months before it came to power, with the majority being U.S. investments. The control of U.S. and Western European monopolies over the Argentine economy has become increasingly severe. In 1965, 65% of the investments in the fifty largest domestic enterprises were foreign capital; currently, three-quarters of large-scale investments are controlled by foreign monopolies. Taking the automobile industry as an example, between 1966 and 1967, four of the largest automobile companies, which were majority-owned by Argentine capital, were either taken over or driven out of business by foreign monopolies, primarily U.S. companies. Meanwhile, some small automobile factories owned by national capital were forced to close.

Under the direction of the International Monetary Fund, which is controlled by the United States, the Onganía dictatorship has devalued the currency three times and abolished foreign exchange controls, facilitating the plundering and repatriation of profits by U.S. capital.

The pro-U.S. dictatorship's reactionary economic policies have led to industrial stagnation, rising prices, and a surge in unemployment in Argentina. In 1967, industrial output fell compared to 1966. The textile and metallurgical industries showed clear signs of stagnation, and automobile production in 1967 was down 10% from 1965. In 1967, 300 factories in the province of Buenos Aires were forced to reduce working days, with 100 of them having to close completely. The commercial bankruptcy rate in 1967 was also up 107% from 1966. Currently, the number of unemployed and underemployed nationwide has reached 1.5 million.

To ensure the economic aggression of U.S. imperialism and maintain its reactionary rule, the dictatorship has implemented a series of fascist measures politically to suppress people's resistance. It immediately declared a so-called "revolutionary law" upon taking power, establishing military dictatorship; issued reactionary laws such as the "Civil Defense Law" and "Anti-Communist Law" to suppress the people, established fascist secret police organizations, and expanded repression agencies; brutally oppressed the working class, abolished the right to strike, took over unions, revoked union legal status, trampled on workers' legitimate rights, and savagely suppressed workers' movements; abolished university autonomy, deprived students of the right to participate in political activities, and persecuted patriotic students who dared to resist.

However, the deeper the oppression, the stronger the resistance. The Argentine people have launched increasingly widespread and intense resistance against the brutal plunder of U.S. imperialism and the pro-U.S. dictatorship's policies of selling out the nation and attacking the people. This year, mass struggles have seen new developments. On May 1st, workers in several cities held anti-U.S., anti-dictatorship demonstrations, chanting slogans such as "We want our country, not to be a colony!" and "Down with the Yankees!" On June 14th, university students across the country held a major strike and the most intense demonstrations in two years. On June 28th, the day marking two years since Onganía's coup, major cities across Argentina simultaneously erupted in worker and student demonstrations against the pro-U.S. dictatorship, with demonstrators bravely fighting against fully armed military police. Currently, mass struggles in Argentina are continuing to develop.

    美帝吸血鬼是阿根廷人民的死对头
    美帝国主义通过它一手扶植的阿根廷军事独裁政权，两年来加紧了对阿根廷的掠夺和剥削，造成阿根廷经济显著恶化，人民生活日益困苦。
    翁加尼亚政权上台后，美帝国主义及其控制下的国际金融机构指使它进一步推行出卖民族利益的经济、社会政策，听任美国垄断资本更凶恶地掠夺国家资源和剥削阿根廷人民。阿根廷经济的殖民地化进一步加深。
    据阿根廷官方报告透露，在独裁政权上台后的头十七个月中，外国资本在阿根廷的直接投资，同它上台前的十七个月比较，增长了百分之一百八十八，其中主要是美国投资。美国和西欧垄断集团对阿根廷经济的控制越来越严重。一九六五年，国内五十家最大企业投资中百分之六十五属于外国资本；目前已有四分之三的大型投资属于外国垄断势力。以汽车业为例，一九六六年到一九六七年之间，阿根廷本国资本占多数的四家最大的汽车公司，已被主要是美国公司的外国垄断企业吞并或搞垮，同时，属于民族资本的一些小汽车厂也被迫关门停业。
    在美国控制的国际货币基金组织的指使下，翁加尼亚独裁政权先后三次宣布货币贬值，并取消外汇管制，以利于美国资本搜刮和汇出利润。
    亲美独裁政权推行的反动经济政策，造成了阿根廷的工业萧条，物价上涨，失业大批增加。一九六七年工业总产值比一九六六年下降。纺织和冶金工业出现明显的萧条，去年的汽车生产比一九六五年下降了百分之十。一九六七年，仅在布宜诺斯艾利斯省就有三百家工厂被迫缩减工作日，其中一百家不得不完全关门。去年商业破产率也比一九六六年上升百分之一百零七。目前全国失业和半失业者已达到一百五十万人。
    为了保证美帝国主义的经济侵略，维护自己的反动统治，独裁政权在政治上采取了一系列法西斯措施，压制人民的反抗。它一上台就宣布所谓“革命法规”，实行军事独裁；颁布“民防法”、“反共法”等镇压人民的反动法令，建立法西斯的特务组织，扩大镇压机构；残酷压迫工人阶级，取消罢工权利，接管工会，取消工会法人资格，践踏工人的正当权利，野蛮镇压工人运动；废除大学自治，剥夺学生参加政治活动的权利，迫害敢于反抗的爱国学生。
    但是，压迫愈深，反抗愈大。阿根廷人民对于美帝国主义的残酷掠夺和亲美独裁政权出卖民族、进攻人民的政策，展开了越来越广泛和强烈的反抗。今年以来，群众斗争又有了新的发展。五月一日，好几个城市的工人举行了反美反独裁示威，高呼“要祖国，不要当殖民地！”“打倒美国佬！”等战斗口号。六月十四日，全国各城市大学生举行大罢课和两年来最激烈的示威游行。六月二十八日，翁加尼亚发动政变上台两整年的这一天，阿根廷全国各主要城市，同时爆发了工人和学生反对亲美独裁统治的大示威，示威群众同全副武装的军警展开了英勇的搏斗。目前，阿根廷的群众斗争正在向前发展。　（据新华社）
