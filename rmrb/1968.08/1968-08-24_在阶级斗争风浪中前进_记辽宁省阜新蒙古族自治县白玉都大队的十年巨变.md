A Great Historical Transformation

In 1958, the people's commune, like a rising sun, appeared on the vast horizon of East Asia. With its characteristics of "political and economic integration" and "large-scale and public ownership," it demonstrated unparalleled superiority and tremendous vitality. The ten-year transformation of Baiyudou Brigade in Hebenzalan Commune, Fuxin Mongol Autonomous County, Liaoning Province, eloquently illustrates this point.

Baiyudou, in Chinese, means "village of prosperity." This name, in the past, was an irony. Here, the mountains are barren, the valleys rugged. Either yellow sand covers the rocks, or rocks cover the yellow sand. The 260-plus households of Mongolian farmers and herdsmen who live here are poor due to the mountains, and the land is infertile. Added to this were the oppression and exploitation by the Kuomintang reactionaries, princes, and landlords, making life bitterer than gall. At that time, a folk song went: "Bare mountains, violent rivers, wide gullies, gullies and ravines cut through the mountains, thin patches of land reveal white bones, six disasters strike every year, toiling like oxen and horses until blood dries up, no clothes or food, enduring hardship."

In 1948, the People's Liberation Army sent by Chairman Mao liberated Baiyudou. The princes and landlords were overthrown, and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Baiyudou embarked on the road to cooperation, establishing the prototype of the people's commune—the Sunrise Farm. After Chairman Mao's great call to "establish people's communes" reached Baiyudou in 1958, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants established the people's commune. Over the past ten years, Baiyudou has undergone earth-shaking changes. Now, a new folk song goes: "Barren mountains turn into oases, green forests by the river, terraced fields winding around the mountains, apples and pears on every branch, people's communes change the world, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline production all flourish, happiness comes from Chairman Mao, forever revolutionary, never stopping."

The contrast between the two folk songs clearly shows the unparalleled superiority of the people's commune. Facing the lush mountains and rolling waves of grain, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants repeatedly bless Chairman Mao with longevity and joyfully shout, "People's communes are great!"

A Great Leap in People's Thoughts

Over the years, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Baiyudou Brigade have studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, raising their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines to unprecedented heights. They love Chairman Mao immensely and hate the Chinese Khrushchev intensely. With every step forward, they engage in unyielding struggles against the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Baiyudou Brigade.

In August 1962, the black wind of the Chinese Khrushchev's "three freedoms and one contract" blew into Baiyudou Brigade. A handful of class enemies stirred, wanting to "dismantle" the brigade's livestock farm. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants firmly refused. Led by revolutionary cadres Enlema and Haibao, who were born into poor peasant families, they launched a head-on struggle against the handful of class enemies, stopping this evil wind.

The class enemies, unwilling to admit defeat, angrily said, "Dismantling the livestock farm is an order from higher authorities. Who dares to defy it?!" Sixty-something-year-old poor peasant Huerle angrily said, "I dare to defy any 'higher authorities' that do not align with Mao Zedong Thought! Chairman Mao did not give such an order, so we will not do it!"

The class enemies were not willing to give up. At the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they forcibly "removed" revolutionary cadre Enlema from office and stirred up the "division of brigades" wind.

"Division of brigades? This is purely a return to individual farming!" Enlema angrily said, "You have removed my 'official position,' but you cannot remove my red heart for defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!"

The class enemies then used "force" to threaten revolutionary cadre Haibao, demanding that he "agree to the division of brigades within twenty minutes." This "old poor peasant association" who once took up the hoe to defend the results of land reform fearlessly said, "Whoever dismantles the people's commune is a counter-revolutionary! I will never agree to the division of brigades in my lifetime!"

The class enemies, having no other recourse, tried to impose the "division of brigades" scheme on the poor and lower-middle peasants.

Someone came to find Damula, asking him which brigade he would join. This poor peasant with deep bitterness and hatred did not hesitate for a moment, saying, "I have long decided to stay in the brigade led by Chairman Mao!" Damula excitedly took out the "suffering quilt" that was still his father's from sixty years ago when he worked for the landlord, and which he had mended to weigh seven or eight pounds. The bitterness of the past surged up in his heart. He pointed to the various colors of the patches and asked in a low but passionate voice, "Brothers, can we take the road of 'division of brigades' back to the past?"

With the help of the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, seventy-something-year-old poor peasant Xu Guang'en invited brigade and production team cadres and some commune members to a contrast meal: the bitter vegetable dumplings were the best food for poor peasants in the old society; the mixed flour cakes were the usual meals during individual farming; the corn cakes were the usual meals during cooperation; the bean-filled sticky cakes were the usual meals after the establishment of the people's commune. This thought-provoking meal was a strong contrast between the old and new societies, a vivid portrayal of the two roads. Xu Guang'en earnestly said, "Brothers, never forget the taste of bitter vegetable dumplings! Forgetting the bitterness of class struggle, even if you have a piece of honey in your mouth, you won't know what sweetness is!"

This vivid class education further raised the class consciousness of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, and not a single person was willing to take the road of "division of brigades" back to the past.

Transforming the World and Creating Miracles

To change the face of poverty and backwardness, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Baiyudou Brigade responded enthusiastically to Chairman Mao's great call to "learn from Dazhai in agriculture," actively engaging in water conservation, afforestation, terracing, and transforming nature. The class enemies jumped out, saying, "Cats don't fight dogs, people don't fight water, can people fight the Dragon King?" "What is afforestation? It's purely blocking our stove doors!"

Wave after wave of evil winds blew in. The hearts of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants surged with anger. They held the Red Book, recalling the history of class struggle since cooperation, and realized: to fight against nature and the earth, we must first fight against the class enemies. They resolutely exposed the class enemies' plots to sabotage agricultural infrastructure construction and engaged in a tenacious struggle against nature. Once, after a heavy rain, more than a hundred carts of willows planted along the west bank of the Xia Sizhu River for over three miles were all washed away. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants said, "The water is big, but the power of the people's commune is greater! If we don't plant a continuous line of trees by the river, we will die with our eyes open!" They pulled over a hundred more carts of saplings, planting one for every one washed away, planting a section for every section washed away. With this spirit, they made 120 mu of riverside forest thrive, a piece of green; they made 8,000 mu of terraced fields on slopes wind around the mountains, reaching the clouds; they made 30 large and small hills, more than 300 gullies, 29 ridges, 58 slopes, and 1,700-plus plots of land all sprout green grass, plant tall pines, grow abundant crops, and even apples from Liaonan could settle in these barren hills. The people's commune has changed the natural face of Baiyudou Brigade. People happily sing, "High mountains and distant forests, gentle hills and fruit mountains, terraced fields winding around the mountains, riverside sandy land becomes a grain field, the commune has the power to turn things around, following the leader, we march forward forever!"

A Lofty Communist Spirit

The establishment of the people's commune has made Baiyudou Brigade prosperous: before cooperation, there were only two rubber-wheeled carts, twenty mules, and nine hundred cattle and sheep. Now, there are thirty rubber-wheeled carts, eighty mules, and two thousand cattle and sheep. The grain yield per mu has increased from less than one hundred jin before the establishment of the commune to two hundred jin. Before the establishment of the commune, grain was not self-sufficient, but now it contributes 3.55 million jin of surplus grain to the state. However, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants are not satisfied with the current achievements. They have their hearts set on the country and their eyes on the world, determined to work for the liberation of all mankind. They heard that the poor and lower-middle peasants in the neighboring Ping'an Brigade were in difficulty and immediately sent the golden copies of Chairman Mao's works, as well as 3,000 jin of grain and more than 500 yuan accumulated daily to support the struggling brigade. The neighboring Zhangjiawo Brigade lacked labor, and the grass and seedlings grew together, threatening to leave the land fallow. After hearing the news, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Baiyudou Brigade immediately sent people to help Zhangjiawo eliminate the grass and weeds and achieve a bumper harvest. The neighboring brigade urgently needed saplings to change the natural landscape, and some well-off middle peasants said, "This is a good time to sell at a high price!" But the poor and lower-middle peasants severely criticized this capitalist thinking, saying, "We are commune members armed with Mao Zedong Thought, we want revolution, not the stench of money from the Chinese Khrushchev!" They freely supported the neighboring brigade with a large number of saplings. Their high level of communist spirit won the praise of the broad revolutionary masses.

    在阶级斗争风浪中前进
    ——记辽宁省阜新蒙古族自治县白玉都大队的十年巨变
    阜革武
    伟大的历史变革
    一九五八年，人民公社象初升的太阳，在亚洲东部广阔的地平线上出现了，她以“政社合一”和“一大二公”的特点，显示出无比优越性和强大生命力。辽宁省阜新蒙古族自治县他本扎兰公社白玉都大队的十年巨变，雄辩地说明了这个问题。
    白玉都，汉语是富裕之村的意思。这个命名，在过去来说是一个讽刺。这里荒山高耸，谷地崎岖，不是黄沙掩埋着石块，就是石块遮盖着黄沙。聚居在这里的二百六十多户蒙古族农牧民，靠山山穷，种地地薄，加上国民党反动派、王爷和白音胡那（地主）的压迫剥削，日子比黄连还苦三分。那时，这里流传着一首歌谣：“山秃水暴河沟宽，沟沟岔岔切断山，小块薄地露白骨，年年种地六灾全，当牛做马血流干，无衣无食受熬煎。”
    一九四八年，毛主席派来的解放军解放了白玉都。打倒了王爷，打倒了白音胡那，白玉都广大贫下中农走向合作化的道路，成立了人民公社的雏型——太阳升农庄。一九五八年，毛主席“还是办人民公社好”的伟大号召传到了白玉都以后，广大贫下中农办起了人民公社。十年来白玉都发生了翻天覆地的变化。现在，这里又流传着一首歌谣：“荒山秃岭变绿洲，河边林海绿悠悠，层层梯田绕山转，苹果鸭梨满枝头，人民公社改天地，农林牧副齐丰收，幸福多亏毛主席，永远革命不停留。”
    两首歌谣的对比，清楚地显示出人民公社的无比优越性。广大贫下中农面对叠翠的群山和翻滚的禾浪，一遍又一遍地祝福毛主席万寿无疆，纵情高呼“人民公社通赛很（就是好）！”
              人的思想大飞跃
    多年来，白玉都大队广大贫下中农，活学活用毛主席著作，阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟空前提高。他们无限热爱毛主席，无比痛恨中国赫鲁晓夫。他们每前进一步，就和中国赫鲁晓夫及其在白玉都大队的代理人进行不屈不挠的斗争。
    一九六二年八月，中国赫鲁晓夫“三自一包”的黑风刮到了白玉都大队，一小撮阶级敌人蠢蠢欲动，要把大队畜牧场“牛羊下放”，广大贫下中农坚决不答应。在老贫农出身的革命干部敖力玛和海包带动下，向一小撮阶级敌人展开了针锋相对的斗争，煞住了这股妖风。
    阶级敌人不服气，气极败坏地说：“牛羊下放，这是上级指示，谁敢顶？！”六十多岁的老贫农胡尔勒气愤地说：“和毛泽东思想对不上号的‘上级’，我就敢顶！毛主席没这样指示，我们就不这样干！”
    阶级敌人并不甘心失败。无产阶级文化大革命一开始，就把坚持社会主义方向的革命干部敖力玛强行“罢官”，并刮起了“分队”的妖风。
      “分队？这纯粹又是要单干！”敖力玛气愤地说：“你们罢了我的‘官’，但罢不了我捍卫毛主席革命路线的红心！”
    阶级敌人又用“武力”威逼革命干部海包，要他“在二十分钟内答应分队”。这个当年拿起“镢把子”保卫土改成果的“老农会”，毫无惧色，他说：“谁拆人民公社的台，谁就是反革命！我一辈子也不答应分队！”
    阶级敌人无计可施，只得把“分队”的鬼主意打在贫下中农身上。
    有人来找达木拉，问他到哪个队去？这个苦大仇深的老贫农毫不犹豫地说：“我早就认准，就在毛主席领导的这个队！”达木拉激动地拿出了还是他阿爸六十年前给白音胡那扛活时做的，经过他又缝补得足有七、八斤重的“受苦褥”，往日辛酸涌上心头，他指着那各种颜色的破补钉，低沉而又激昂地问：“穷哥们，咱们能走‘分队’这条回头路吗？”
    在解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，七十多岁的老贫农徐广恩请大队、生产队干部和一些社员吃了
  一次对比式的饭：那苦菜团子是旧社会贫农最好的饭；那糠菜混合的饽饽是单干时家常饭；那包米面饽饽是合作化时一般饭；那豆馅粘饽是人民公社化后普通的饭，这发人深思的饭，是新旧两个社会的强烈对比，是两条道路的鲜明写照。徐广恩语重心长地说：“穷哥们，千万别忘了苦菜团子的滋味呀！忘了阶级苦，那嘴里就是含块蜜糖，也不知道啥叫甜哪！”
    活生生的阶级教育，进一步提高了广大贫下中农的阶级觉悟，没有一个人愿意走“分队”这条回头路。
              改天换地创奇迹
    为了改变贫穷落后的面貌，白玉都大队贫下中农坚决响应毛主席“农业学大寨”的伟大号召，积极治水、封山、造林、修梯田，彻底改造大自然。阶级敌人便跳出来说：“猫不跟狗斗，人不跟水斗，人还能斗过龙王爷？”“啥叫封山？纯粹是堵咱们的灶炕门！”……。
    一股股妖风劈头刮来。广大贫下中农心中怒潮澎湃，他们手捧红色宝书，回忆了合作化以来阶级斗争历史，认识到：与天斗与地斗，首先要与阶级敌人斗。他们坚决揭露了阶级敌人破坏农田基本建设的阴谋诡计，向大自然进行顽强的斗争。有一次，一场暴雨过后，下四家子西河沿三里多长的一百多车杨柳埋干全都冲走，广大贫下中农都说：“水大，没有人民公社的威力大！不栽活河边成片林，我们死不瞑目！”他们又拉来一百多车树栽子，冲走一棵栽一棵，冲走一段栽一段。就以这种精神，使一百二十亩河边林茁壮成长，一片翠绿；使八千亩坡耕地的梯田绕山盘岩，直入云天；使三十座大小山头、三百多条沟岔、二十九道梁、五十八面坡、一千七百多块土地，全都育出了青青的牧草，植成了挺拔的苍松，长满了丰盛的庄稼，就连辽南的苹果也能够在这塞上秃岭安家落户了。人民公社使白玉都大队的自然面貌发生了巨变。人们高兴地唱道：“高山远山森林山，近山缓山花果山，层层梯田绕山转，河边沙地米粮川，公社自有回天力，跟着领袖永向前！”
            崇高的共产主义精神
    人民公社化使白玉都大队富裕起来了：合作化前，这里只有两台胶车，二十匹骡马，九百只牛羊，现在发展到三十台胶车，八十匹骡马，两千只牛羊。粮食亩产量由公社化前不到一百斤，增加到二百斤，公社化前粮食不能自给，如今还给国家交售余粮三百五十五万斤。然而广大贫下中农并没有满足眼前的成绩。他们胸怀祖国，放眼世界，决心为解放全人类而劳动，他们听说邻队平安地贫下中农发生困难，立即把金光闪闪的毛主席著作以及逐日积攒的三千斤粮食和五百多元钱支援给困难队。邻队张家洼因劳力不足，草苗齐长，眼看要荒地，白玉都大队广大贫下中农闻讯后，立即派人帮助张家洼消灭了草荒，夺得了丰收。邻队为了改变自然面貌，迫切需要树栽子，一些富裕中农说：“正好在这个节骨眼卖个高价！”可是贫下中农却狠狠地批判了这种资本主义思想，说：“我们是毛泽东思想武装起来的人民公社社员，我们要的是革命，不是中国赫鲁晓夫那股铜钱臭味！”他们免费支援给邻队大量树栽子。他们的这种高度的共产主义精神，博得了广大革命群众的称赞。
