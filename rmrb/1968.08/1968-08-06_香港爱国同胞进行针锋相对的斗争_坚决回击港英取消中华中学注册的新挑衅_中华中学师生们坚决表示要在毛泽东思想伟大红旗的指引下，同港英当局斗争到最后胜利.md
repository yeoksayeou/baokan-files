Hong Kong Patriots Engage in Head-to-Head Struggle

Firmly Repel the British Hong Kong Authorities' New Provocation of Cancelling the Registration of Chung Hwa Middle School

Teachers and Students of Chung Hwa Middle School Resolutely Declare to Struggle Under the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought to the Final Victory

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, August 5th – Hong Kong compatriots from all walks of life have expressed great indignation and strong protest against the British Hong Kong authorities' new persecution of plotting to cancel the registration of Chung Hwa Middle School. They are engaged in a head-to-head struggle with the British Hong Kong authorities, firmly repelling the new provocation of British imperialism.

	Since the British Hong Kong authorities arbitrarily announced on July 19th that they had "begun legal procedures to cancel the registration of Chung Hwa Middle School," Hong Kong compatriots have launched a new wave of opposition to the new atrocities of British imperialism and denunciation of British imperialism's policy of enslaving education and destroying patriotic education. In the past half month, compatriots from various walks of life have held more than forty mass rallies. The Hong Kong and Kowloon Patriotic Struggle Committee Against British Persecution and various industry workers, educational circles, student circles, commercial circles, and film industry struggle committees have issued statements, strongly protesting against the new persecution by the British Hong Kong authorities. They solemnly pointed out: The British Hong Kong authorities attempted to suppress the widespread dissemination of the great Mao Zedong Thought by patriotic teachers, students, and compatriots, and attempted to suppress the rapid development of patriotic education in Hong Kong, thus creating this fascist farce. However, the British Hong Kong authorities' goals are absolutely unattainable. If British imperialism insists on creating incidents and worsening the situation in Hong Kong, it will only provoke broader and more intense resistance from Hong Kong patriots, and it will only be like lifting a stone to drop on one's own feet.

	With the strong support of the broad patriotic compatriots, the teachers and students of Chung Hwa Middle School are full of fighting spirit and brimming with confidence in victory. In recent days, the entire school's teachers, students, parents, and alumni have held protest rallies. Teachers and students have written pledges, resolutely declaring to struggle to the end under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought against the British Hong Kong authorities until achieving the final victory.

	Since July 23rd, teachers, students, parents, alumni, and representatives from the educational circles, student circles, and maritime workers of Chung Hwa Middle School have visited the British Hong Kong "Governor's Office," "Secretary for Chinese Affairs Office," "Education Department," and "Police Headquarters" a total of thirteen times, strongly protesting against the British Hong Kong authorities' fascist plot to cancel the registration of Chung Hwa Middle School. Representatives of Chung Hwa Middle School reiterated their three solemn demands: immediately revoke the "closure order" on the school premises of Chung Hwa Middle School, immediately stop the plot to cancel the registration of Chung Hwa Middle School, and immediately release the principal of Chung Hwa Middle School, Wong Chuen-fan, and other patriotic teachers and students who are still illegally imprisoned in jail, and guarantee their personal safety. They stated: To safeguard the sacred rights of the Chinese people to conduct patriotic education in their own territory of Hong Kong, and to be responsible to the broad students and parents, they decided to file a "complaint" against the British persecution.

	So far, the British Hong Kong authorities have not stopped persecuting Chung Hwa Middle School. On August 3rd, the relevant British Hong Kong authorities sent a letter to the principal of Chung Hwa Middle School, Wong Chuen-fan, rudely and unreasonably rejecting the solemn demand of Chung Hwa Middle School to release Wong Chuen-fan to conduct the "complaint," and refusing to extend the deadline for the "complaint."

	Meanwhile, the British Hong Kong authorities have also colluded with American imperialism and the KMT, using American imperialism and KMT newspapers to spread rumors and slander patriotic schools, in order to create a reactionary "public opinion" for further persecution of patriotic schools. The British Hong Kong "Education Department" has also taken to the field, arrogantly shouting that if they do not "obey" the reactionary "laws" of British Hong Kong, they will "definitely take action to deal with it."

	The British Hong Kong authorities' rude and unreasonable measures and arrogant shouts have provoked the great indignation of patriotic compatriots. They are closely watching the development of the situation and are ready at any time to give a resolute rebuke to the new plot of the British Hong Kong authorities to continue persecuting Chung Hwa Middle School and expand this persecution to other patriotic schools.

　　香港爱国同胞进行针锋相对的斗争
　　坚决回击港英取消中华中学注册的新挑衅
　　中华中学师生们坚决表示要在毛泽东思想伟大红旗的指引下，同港英当局斗争到最后胜利
    据新华社香港五日电　香港各界爱国同胞对香港英国当局阴谋取消中华中学注册的新的迫害罪行表示极大的愤怒和强烈的抗议。他们正在同港英当局进行针锋相对的斗争，坚决回击港英帝国主义的新挑衅。
    自从港英当局在七月十九日无理宣布“已开始进行取消中华中学注册的法律手续”以来，香港广大爱国同胞，掀起了一个反对港英帝国主义新暴行和控诉港英帝国主义推行奴化教育、摧残爱国教育事业罪恶政策的新高潮。在这半个多月里，各界爱国同胞先后举行了四十多次群众集会，港九各界同胞反对港英迫害斗争委员会和各业工人、教育界、学生界、工商界、电影界等斗委会，分别发表声明，强烈抗议港英当局的新迫害。他们严正指出：港英当局妄图遏止爱国师生和爱国同胞广泛传播伟大的毛泽东思想，妄图遏止香港爱国教育事业的迅速发展，一手制造了这一出法西斯丑剧。但是，港英当局的目的是绝对达不到的。如果港英帝国主义硬要制造事端，恶化香港局势，只能激起香港爱国同胞更广泛更剧烈的反抗，只能是搬起石头打自己的脚。
    在广大爱国同胞的有力支持下，中华中学全体师生斗志昂扬，充满必胜的信心。连日来，全校师生、家长和校友分别举行抗议集会。师生们纷纷写下决心书，坚决表示要在毛泽东思想伟大红旗的指引下，同港英当局斗争到底，直到取得最后胜利。
    七月二十三日以来，中华中学的教师、学生、家长、校友和教育界、学生界以及海运工人代表先后十三次前往港英“总督府”、“辅政司署”、“教育司署”和“警务处”，强烈抗议港英当局阴谋取消中华中学注册的法西斯暴行。中华中学的代表重申了他们的三项严正要求：立即撤销对中华中学校舍的“封闭令”，立即停止取消中华中学注册的阴谋，立即释放中华中学校长黄祖芬和这个学校其他仍被非法监禁在狱的爱国师生，并保证他们的人身安全。他们表示：为了维护中国人民在自己的领土香港兴办爱国教育事业的神圣权利，为了对广大学生和家长负责，决定对港英的迫害进行“抗诉”。
    到目前为止，港英当局并没有停止对中华中学的迫害。八月三日，港英有关当局致函中华中学校长黄祖芬，横蛮无理地拒绝中华中学提出的释放黄祖芬校长以便进行“抗诉”的严正要求，并拒绝把“抗诉”的期限推延。
    与此同时，港英当局还勾结美帝国主义和蒋帮，利用美帝国主义和蒋帮报纸，对爱国学校大肆造谣污蔑，以制造进一步迫害爱国学校的反动“舆论”。港英“教育司署”也赤膊上阵，狂妄叫嚣什么“如果不遵守”港英的反动“法律”，就“一定会采取行动对付”。
    港英当局横蛮无理的措施和狂妄叫嚣，激起了爱国同胞极大的愤怒。他们正密切注视着事态的发展，随时准备对港英当局继续迫害中华中学并把这一迫害扩大到其他爱国学校的新阴谋，给以坚决的回击。
