Mao Zedong Thought combined with actual struggle is invincible. The armed forces of the Thai people have achieved brilliant results in the past three years, annihilating more than 2,400 enemy personnel, shooting down and damaging multiple enemy aircraft, and helping the masses establish revolutionary governments.

	New China News Agency, August 6th — According to a broadcast by the "Voice of the Thai People" radio station on August 6th, the armed forces of the Thai people, led by the Communist Party of Thailand, have flexibly applied Chairman Mao's strategies and tactics for people's war, combining them with local specific conditions, and have achieved brilliant results over the past three years.

	The radio station said that the flames of people's armed struggle are now burning in 30 out of 71 provinces in Thailand. According to incomplete statistics, from August 1965 to the present, in just three years, the people's armed forces have engaged in more than 1,100 large and small battles with the U.S.-Thanom clique, annihilating more than 2,400 enemy personnel, including over 20 U.S. invaders, shooting down and damaging more than 10 enemy aircraft, destroying numerous enemy vehicles, and seizing a large amount of weapons and ammunition.

	The radio station said that the Thai people's armed forces, led by the Communist Party of Thailand, are a revolutionary armed group that carries out political tasks. In addition to fighting and annihilating the enemy's military forces, they also undertake major political tasks such as propaganda, organizing the masses, arming the masses, and helping the masses establish revolutionary governments. Over the past three years, the Thai people's armed forces have extensively and deeply conducted propaganda, organizational, and arming work among the masses. According to incomplete statistics, since 1967, the people's armed forces have conducted propaganda work among the masses more than 200 times, assisting the masses in executing over 400 notorious local reactionary officials, spies, and informants.

	The radio station said that the people's armed forces care about the sufferings of the masses, enthusiastically treat the masses' illnesses, help the masses solve difficulties, and share weal and woe with the masses. The people's armed forces' spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people is highly praised by the masses. The masses regard the people's armed forces as their own children, supporting them in every way. This is the inexhaustible source of strength for the people's armed forces. Therefore, the people's armed forces grow stronger with each battle and can repeatedly smash the enemy's counter-revolutionary "encirclements."

	"The Voice of the Thai People" radio station pointed out that the development and brilliant victories of the Thai people's armed forces over the past three years prove that the U.S.-Thanom clique is a paper tiger and that the people can defeat it. It can be firmly believed that as long as the Thai people, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, persist in a protracted and fierce armed struggle, the final victory will definitely belong to the Thai people.

　　毛泽东思想同实际斗争相结合无往不胜
　　泰国人民武装三年来战绩辉煌
　　歼灭敌人两千四百多，打落打伤敌机多架，帮助群众建立革命政权
    新华社六日讯　据“泰国人民之声”电台六日广播，泰国共产党领导下的泰国人民武装，灵活运用毛主席关于人民战争的战略战术，同当地具体情况相结合，三年来取得了辉煌的战绩。
    电台说，人民武装斗争的烽火，今天已在泰国七十一个府中的三十个府熊熊燃烧。据不完全统计，从一九六五年八月到现在，短短的三年时间里，人民武装同美国—他侬集团进行了大小战斗共一千一百多次，歼灭敌人两千四百多人，其中美国侵略军二十多人，打落、打伤敌机十多架，击毁敌人军车多辆，缴获大批武器弹药。
    电台说，泰国共产党领导的泰国人民武装是一个执行革命的政治任务的武装集团，它除了打仗消灭敌人军事力量之外，还担负宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众、帮助群众建立革命政权等项重大的政治任务。三年来，泰国人民武装在各地广泛深入地进行宣传、组织、武装群众工作。据不完全统计，从一九六七年以来，人民武装进行宣传群众工作就有二百多次，协助群众处决罪大恶极的地方反动官员和特务、暗探四百多人。
    这家电台说，人民武装关心群众的疾苦，热情给群众治疗疾病，帮助群众解决困难，和群众同甘共苦。人民武装这种全心全意为人民服务的精神，深受群众的赞扬。群众把人民武装看成是自己的子弟兵，从各方面全力支持人民武装。这是人民武装无穷无尽的力量源泉。因此，人民武装越战越强，能够一次又一次地粉碎敌人的反革命“围剿”。
    “泰国人民之声”电台指出，泰国人民武装三年来的发展壮大和取得的辉煌胜利，证明了美国—他侬集团是纸老虎，人民能够战胜它。可以坚信，只要泰国人民在泰国共产党的正确领导下，坚持持久、猛烈的武装斗争，最后胜利一定是属于泰国人民的。（附图片）
