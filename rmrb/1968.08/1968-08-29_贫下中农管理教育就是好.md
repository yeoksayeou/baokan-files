We heard from the radio Chairman Mao's latest directive: "To carry out the proletarian education revolution, it is necessary to have the leadership of the working class, to have the participation of the working masses, and to cooperate with the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. Together with the students, teachers, and workers in the school who are determined to carry the proletarian education revolution through to the end, implement the revolutionary three-in-one combination. The worker propaganda teams must stay in the schools for a long time, participate in all the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and forever lead the schools. In the countryside, schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants." Chairman Mao spoke to the hearts of us poor and lower-middle peasants. This latest directive is extremely wise and correct, pointing out the direction and path for the proletarian education revolution, serving as a sharp weapon to smash the revisionist educational system, as a grand blueprint for cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, and as a strategic measure to prevent revisionism.

Chairman Mao supports us poor and lower-middle peasants, and we must make Chairman Mao proud!

Following Chairman Mao's teaching that "education must be revolutionized," we established the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Education Committee on April 1st this year, together with the military training soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and the revolutionary teachers and students of Xishan Central Primary School, to explore the path of educational revolution.

Great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The question of for whom is a fundamental question, a question of principle. ... If this fundamental question is not solved, many other questions will also be difficult to solve." Xishan Central Primary School is located in the countryside, and most of the students are the children of poor and lower-middle peasants. However, in the past, the leadership of the school was in the hands of class enemies. They favored bourgeois intellectuals, instilled bourgeois ideas in the students, and poisoned the minds of the children of poor and lower-middle peasants, causing them to become alienated from us in their thoughts. At the beginning of this year, revolutionary teachers and students, holding the precious book "Chairman Mao on Educational Revolution," came to us for a social survey and criticized the revisionist educational line. We told them: "In the past, you sat on the wrong side. Liu Shaoqi is the 'main switch,' and wherever the poison flows, it causes harm! Once children go to school and learn a bit, they think they are superior to farmers and always look for easy jobs. If this continues, there will be no successors for us poor and lower-middle peasants!" In the past, we always felt that we had no culture and couldn't handle the "ink" business. Now, we deeply feel that our responsibility is great. If we don't manage it, the roots of revisionism cannot be uprooted, and we poor and lower-middle peasants will face the danger of suffering twice! We must manage it. We then, together with the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, proposed to the school revolutionary committee the demand to organize the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Education Committee.

After the establishment of the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Education Committee, we hold a meeting once a month to listen to the school's report on the educational revolution situation. We also reflect on the students' performance in the production teams, combining school education with social practice education, and jointly study the educational plan. In the past, the revisionist educational line emphasized professional skills over politics. Now, we follow Chairman Mao's teaching that "class struggle is your main course" and, based on the students' current thoughts, give a class struggle lesson every week, have a bitter meal, and make the revolutionary teachers and students deeply understand the suffering of the laboring people in the past from being exploited and oppressed, and understand that it is Chairman Mao who led us poor people to revolt and stand up.

The Xishan Production Brigade was the place where the second-in-command of the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the former Beijing Municipal Committee, Peng Zhen, Liu Ren, and Siu Ren, carried out the "Taoyuan Experience," suppressing the broad revolutionary masses and shielding landlords and rich peasants, saying that landlords and rich peasants were honest and changing their status to "agricultural laborers"; saying that poor and lower-middle peasants liked to pick faults and were not honest. Through revolutionary criticism, we exposed Liu Ren's plot of "fake four cleans, true restoration." We changed the criticism meeting from the classroom to the fields and courtyards of the production teams. Through these live education sessions, we trained the students to use class struggle views and class analysis methods to criticize reactionary things. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants saw their children holding the red book and standing on the podium, strongly criticizing the class enemies, and were overjoyed. They said: "With such successors, our country will not change color, and we are at ease!"

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Educate them to get close to workers and peasants, be determined to serve workers and peasants, and oppose the idea of looking down on workers and peasants." In the past, the school was closed off and even when teaching agricultural knowledge, it was done indoors with potted plants, not in the vast fields. Some teachers called cabbage seedlings radish seedlings, and there were many laughable incidents. Poor and lower-middle peasants reflected: children go to school to read about flowers, grass, mountains, and water, the more they read, the more foolish they become, and they look down on us poor and lower-middle peasants, thinking we are "backward." To address this active thought, for several months, the school arranged for students to participate in labor in the production teams twice a week. In labor practice, poor and lower-middle peasants gave them lectures on the "Three Articles" and introduced advanced experiences of the production team's poor and lower-middle peasants in studying and applying the "Three Articles" and eliminating selfishness and establishing public spirit. For example, in the past, when working, they only cared about earning work points and forgot about national affairs. Now, after criticizing the revisionist poison of "material incentives" and "work points as the commander," everyone takes the bright images of Zhang Zide, White Agnes, and Old Fool as examples, fiercely fights against selfishness, and establishes a loyal spirit to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The advanced deeds of poor and lower-middle peasants in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought helped the broad revolutionary teachers and students change their past wrong tendencies of looking down on farmers and despising labor. The broad revolutionary teachers and students deeply felt through practice: poor and lower-middle peasants have the deepest feelings for Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line, the deepest hatred for Liu Shaoqi's revisionist educational line, and the strongest disgust for the two-faced behavior of some intellectuals. They have the richest experience in class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation. They are determined to thoroughly criticize Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, uproot the poisonous roots of education being separated from proletarian politics, separated from the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and separated from production practice, and become good successors to the poor and lower-middle peasants.

Based on the cleansing of the class ranks, Xishan Central Primary School absorbed representatives of poor and lower-middle peasants to participate in the school revolutionary committee and take on major leadership roles, ensuring from an organizational perspective that "poor and lower-middle peasants manage the school." This is a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line! We must not disappoint Chairman Mao's earnest expectations and turn the school into a strong fortress for preventing revisionism!

    贫下中农管理教育就是好
    北京海淀区西山中心小学贫下中农办学委员会
    我们从广播里听到毛主席的最新指示：“实现无产阶级教育革命，必须有工人阶级领导，必须有工人群众参加，配合解放军战士，同学校的学生、教员、工人中决心把无产阶级教育革命进行到底的积极分子实行革命的三结合。工人宣传队要在学校中长期留下去，参加学校中全部斗、批、改任务，并且永远领导学校。在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校。”毛主席他老人家说到咱贫下中农心坎里去了。这一最新指示，真是无比英明，无比正确，指明了无产阶级教育革命的方向和道路，是摧毁修正主义教育制度的锐利武器，是培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的宏伟纲领，是反修防修的战略措施。
    毛主席为咱贫下中农撑腰，咱贫下中农一定为毛主席争气！
    我们遵循毛主席“教育要革命”的教导，于今年四月一日成立了贫下中农办学委员会，和军训的解放军战士以及西山中心小学革命师生一起，探索教育革命的道路。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“为什么人的问题，是一个根本的问题，原则的问题。……这个根本问题不解决，其他许多问题也就不易解决。”西山中心小学本来在农村，学生大部分是咱贫下中农子弟。可是，过去学校的领导权被阶级敌人把持着，他们重用资产阶级知识分子，向学生灌输资产阶级思想，毒害贫下中农的子女，使他们在思想上和咱贫下中农隔离开了。今年年初，革命师生捧着《毛主席论教育革命》的宝书，来到我们中间作社会调查，批判修正主义教育路线。我们对他们说：“过去，你们的屁股坐错了，中国赫鲁晓夫是‘总闸’，流毒流到哪儿，哪儿中毒！孩子上了学，念了点书，就觉着比农民‘高’，尽想找阔事。再这样下去，就没有咱贫下中农的接班人啦！”以前，我们总觉得自己没文化，“墨水”的事儿管不了。现在，深深感到我们的责任重大，咱不管，修正主义根子就挖不掉，咱贫下中农就有受二茬罪的危险！我们一定得管。我们便和解放军战士一块，向学校革命委员会提出组织贫下中农办学委员会的要求。
    贫下中农办学委员会组成后，每月例会一次，听取学校汇报教育革命情况，我们也把学生在生产队的表现反映上来，把学校教育和社会实践教育结合起来，共同研究教育计划。过去，修正主义教育路线重业务、轻政治，现在我们遵循毛主席“阶级斗争是你们的一门主课”的教导，针对学生的活思想，每周由贫下中农上阶级斗争课，吃忆苦饭，使广大革命师生具体深刻地了解劳动人民过去受剥削、受压迫的痛苦，懂得是毛主席领导咱穷苦人民闹革命翻了身。
    西山大队是旧北京市委彭真反革命修正主义集团二头目刘仁四清时蹲点的地方。他在这里加紧积极推行“桃园经验”，打击广大革命群众，包庇地主富农，说什么地富老实，把他们的成份改成“农业劳动者”；说贫下中农爱挑刺儿，不老实。我们通过革命大批判，揭露了刘仁“假四清，真复辟”的阴谋诡计。我们把批判会从教室改到生产队地头、场院召开。通过这些活的教育，锻炼了学生用阶级斗争观点和阶级分析的方法批判反动事物的能力。广大贫下中农看着自己的孩子拿着红彤彤的宝书，走上讲台，有力地批判阶级敌人，打心眼里高兴。他们说：“有了这样的接班人，我们的国家就不会变颜色，我们就放心了！”
    毛主席教导我们：“教育他们接近工农，决心为工农服务，反对看不起工农的意识。”过去学校关起门来办，即使讲农业知识，也是端着花盆讲，不到广阔的田间上课。有的教师把白菜苗说成萝卜秧，笑话百出。贫下中农反映：孩子上学念的花草山水，越读越蠢，还看不起俺贫下中农，嫌俺们“落后”。针对这种活思想，几个月来，学校每周安排学生两次到生产队参加劳动。在劳动实践中，由贫下中农给他们讲“老三篇”，介绍本队贫下中农活学活用“老三篇”、破私立公的先进经验。例如，过去干活就知道挣工分，忘了国家大事。现在，批判了“物质刺激”、“工分挂帅”的修正主义流毒，大家都以张思德、白求恩、老愚公的光辉形象作为榜样，狠斗“私”字，树立忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的一个“忠”字。贫下中农活学活用毛泽东思想的先进事迹，帮助广大革命师生改变了过去看不起农民、轻视劳动的错误倾向。广大革命师生从实践中深深体会到：贫下中农对毛主席的无产阶级教育路线感情最深，对中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义教育路线最憎恨，对某些知识分子言行不一的两面派作风最厌恶，阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验的经验最丰富。他们决心彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义教育路线，铲除教育脱离无产阶级政治、脱离工农兵群众、脱离生产实践的毒根，做贫下中农的好后代。
    西山中心小学在清理阶级队伍的基础上，吸收贫下中农代表参加校革命委员会并担任主要领导工作，从组织上保证“贫下中农管理学校”。这是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利！我们一定不辜负毛主席的殷切期望，把学校变成反修防修的坚强堡垒！
