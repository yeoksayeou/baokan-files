	Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Cannot Do Without the Leadership of the Working Class

	Editor Comrades:

	Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "The working class is the leading class." His words truly resonate with the hearts of us poor and lower-middle peasants.

	In our village, there are a few factories nearby. The workers in these factories implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions swiftly and resolutely. They also help us poor and lower-middle peasants keep up with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, playing the leading role of the working class.

	Last spring, a handful of class enemies used various conspiratorial tactics to stir up an economic wind, attempting to sabotage the revolution and production in the countryside. The workers from the nearby Instrument Factory and Paper Mill immediately sent propaganda teams to join us poor and lower-middle peasants in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, spreading Mao Zedong Thought, and exposing the crimes of the class enemies in a timely manner, thus foiling their conspiracies.

	Not long ago, our commune established a revolutionary committee, and our production brigade also formed a new leadership team. Some comrades began to feel complacent and relaxed. The worker comrades again joined us in studying Chairman Mao's teachings: "We must never relax our vigilance against the desperate revenge plots of the imperialists and their running dogs just because we have won victories," sharing their personal experiences after establishing the revolutionary committee, helping us to intensify class struggle, and root out a handful of class enemies. Many workers participated in the struggle-criticism meetings, standing firm in their positions, clearly distinguishing between love and hate, and striking hard at a handful of class enemies. Many poor and lower-middle peasants deeply felt: "The worker comrades truly deserve to be our leading class!"

	In daily life, the worker comrades also join us in carrying out revolutionary criticism and struggle. The workers living in our brigade, after work, join us in Mao Zedong Thought study classes, struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism, and study and implement each of Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

	The worker comrades also provide great support in production. In recent years, following Chairman Mao's teachings, we have carried forward the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle, vigorously developing paddy fields. The workers from the nearby factories immediately helped us solve power and water supply issues. Our brigade's large vegetable fields urgently needed irrigation, and the worker comrades immediately sent a repair team to fix the water pumps and wells for us during the evenings and rest days. Over the past ten years since the establishment of the people's commune, our brigade has undergone tremendous changes, with grain production continuously increasing. This is inseparable from the support of the worker comrades. Every year, we also support industrial construction with the actual actions of producing more than ten million pounds of vegetables and a large amount of grain. In this way, we have established a deep bond with the working class. We deeply feel that we poor and lower-middle peasants cannot do without the leadership of the working class, and the Chinese revolution cannot do without the leadership of the working class.

### 贫下中农离不开工人阶级的领导

    工人阶级是领导阶级
    贫下中农离不开工人阶级的领导编辑同志：
    毛主席最近指示我们：“工人阶级是领导阶级。”他老人家的话，真是说到我们贫下中农的心坎上了。
    在我们村附近，有几个工厂。厂里的工人老大哥，落实毛主席的一系列最新指示最迅速，最坚决。他们还帮助我们贫下中农紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，发挥了工人阶级的领导作用。
    去年春天，一小撮阶级敌人采取各种阴谋手段，刮起经济主义黑风，妄图破坏农村的革命和生产。我们大队附近的仪表厂和造纸厂的工人老大哥，马上派来宣传队，和我们贫下中农一起活学活用毛主席著作，宣传毛泽东思想，及时地揭露了阶级敌人的罪行，使阶级敌人的阴谋诡计未能得逞。
    不久以前，我们公社成立了革命委员会，大队也成立了新的领导班子，有少数同志就产生了麻痹和松劲情绪。工人老大哥又同我们一起学习毛主席的教导：“我们决不可因为胜利，而放松对于帝国主义分子及其走狗们的疯狂的报复阴谋的警惕性”，介绍他们成立革委会后的切身体会，帮助我们狠抓阶级斗争，揪出了一小撮阶级敌人。很多工人参加了批判斗争大会，他们个个立场坚定，爱憎分明，狠狠打击了一小撮阶级敌人。许多贫下中农都深有感触地说：“工人老大哥真不愧是我们的领导阶级！”
    平时，工人老大哥还和我们一起开展革命大批判。在我们大队住的一些工人，下班后就和我们一起参加毛泽东思想学习班，一起斗私批修，一起学习和落实毛主席的每一个最新指示。
    工人老大哥在生产上对我们支援也很大。前几年，我们遵照毛主席的教导，发扬自力更生、艰苦奋斗的革命精神，大力开辟水田。附近工厂的工人，立即帮助我们解决动力和水力问题。我们大队的大面积菜田急需灌溉，工人老大哥又马上派来维修队，利用晚间和休息日，为我们修理好水泵和电井。建立人民公社十年来，我们大队发生了巨大变化，粮食产量不断上升。这是与工人老大哥的支援分不开的。我们每年也以生产一千余万斤蔬菜和大量粮食的实际行动支援工业建设。就这样，我们和工人阶级建立了鱼水般的阶级感情。我们深深体会到：我们贫下中农离不开工人阶级的领导，中国革命离不开工人阶级的领导。
