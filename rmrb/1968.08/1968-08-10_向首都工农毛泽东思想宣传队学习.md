The great proletarian cultural revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, with the revolutionary Red Guards as the vanguard and the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers as the main force, is advancing towards an all-round victory with unprecedented momentum. Victory reports are coming in one after another, and the songs of triumph are shaking the heavens. The situation across the country is excellent.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Only the working class has the farthest vision, is the most selfless, and is the most thorough in revolution. The entire history of revolution has proven that without the leadership of the working class, the revolution will fail, and with the leadership of the working class, the revolution will be victorious." The Capital Workers and Peasants Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team bears the trust of the 7 million people of the capital. To resolutely follow and bravely defend the great strategic deployment of our great leader Chairman Mao, they have come to Tsinghua University to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. This revolutionary action is excellent, truly excellent! We, the entire personnel of the 834th Unit, express our most resolute support for them and pledge to unite with them, fight with them, and achieve victory with them!

The Capital Workers and Peasants Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team is a new type of revolutionary and combat-ready team composed of worker masses as the main body, according to Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. During their work in Tsinghua University, they have shown an extremely deep proletarian sentiment of being loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. With a heart of loyalty and a spirit of fearlessness, they have worked tirelessly, day and night, overcoming numerous obstacles, enthusiastically propagating and resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They have achieved great success, which is a great victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought. The Capital Workers and Peasants Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, with the shining example of the working class, has written a glorious page in the history of the proletarian cultural revolution in the capital and made tremendous contributions to achieving the all-round victory of the proletarian cultural revolution. They are truly the working class of the capital fighting at Chairman Mao's side!

The revolutionary actions of the Capital Workers and Peasants Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team have prominently demonstrated the leading role of the working class and the peasant masses in the proletarian cultural revolution and the proletarian educational revolution. Their revolutionary actions have prominently shown that the working class has the farthest vision, the broadest mind, the most thorough revolutionary spirit, the strongest revolutionary discipline, the greatest selflessness, and the most loyalty to Chairman Mao's words. They are the most loving of Chairman Mao, the most loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, the most faithful to Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and the most resolute in defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line! We, the entire personnel of the 834th Unit, learn from and salute the Capital Workers and Peasants Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team!

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Class struggle, some classes win, some classes are eliminated. This is history, this is the history of civilization for thousands of years." When the Capital Workers and Peasants Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team enthusiastically propagates and implements Chairman Mao's latest instructions, a small handful of class enemies feel that their end is coming, fearing to death and hating to madness, inciting and deceiving a very few people to engage in sabotage and disruption. However, the Capital Workers and Peasants Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and infinitely loves the Red Guards. They always hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasize proletarian politics, and firmly propagate and defend the highest instructions.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Carry the revolution through to the end." The task before us is arduous. Class enemies will not voluntarily withdraw from the stage of history. We must never forget class struggle. We, the People's Liberation Army, are the strong pillars of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the sons and daughters of the people. We are forever united with the broad masses of workers and peasants and the revolutionary Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, be infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, closely unite around the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, under the command of the proletarian headquarters, unite our will, unite our steps, and unite our actions. We must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, thoroughly criticize the reactionary "multi-center theory," and firmly strike down a small handful of class enemies to achieve the all-round victory of the proletarian cultural revolution! We firmly believe that under the guidance of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and with the joint efforts of the Capital Workers and Peasants Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team and the revolutionary Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students of Tsinghua University, we will definitely carry the proletarian cultural revolution at Tsinghua University through to the end. A red Tsinghua armed with Mao Zedong Thought will definitely be born in the triumphant songs of class struggle!

　　向首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队学习
　　八三四一部队全体指战员
    我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动、亲自领导的以革命的红卫兵为先锋，以广大的工农兵群众为主力军的无产阶级文化大革命，正在向全面胜利迅猛发展。捷报频传，凯歌震天，全国的形势空前大好。
    毛主席教导我们：“只有工人阶级最有远见，大公无私，最富于革命的彻底性。整个革命历史证明，没有工人阶级的领导，革命就要失败，有了工人阶级的领导，革命就胜利了。”首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队肩负着首都七百万人民的重托，为了坚决紧跟和勇敢捍卫伟大领袖毛主席的伟大战略部署，来到清华大学宣传毛泽东思想，这一革命行动好得很，好极了！我们八三四一部队全体指战员，对他们表示最坚决的支持，誓与他们团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起！
    首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队是根据毛主席的伟大战略部署组成的一支新型的革命化、战斗化的以工人群众为主体的工农宣传队伍。他们在清华大学开展工作的日子里，怀着无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席革命路线的无比深厚的无产阶级感情，以誓死捍卫毛主席革命路线的赤胆忠心和大无畏的英雄气概，不怕疲劳，不怕狂风暴雨，日以继夜，艰苦奋斗，与清华大学革命的红卫兵小将和革命的师生员工一起，克服了重重阻力，热情宣传和坚决落实毛主席的最新指示，已经取得了很大成绩，这是毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队用工人阶级的光辉榜样，为首都无产阶级文化大革命的历史写下了光辉的一页，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，作出了巨大的贡献，不愧是战斗在毛主席身边的首都工人阶级！
    首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队的革命行动，突出地显示了工人阶级和工农群众在无产阶级文化大革命和无产阶级教育革命中的主力军作用。他们的革命行动，突出地表现了工人阶级眼光最远大，胸怀最宽广，最富有彻底的革命精神，最有革命的组织纪律性，最大公无私，最听毛主席的话，对毛主席最热爱，对毛泽东思想最忠诚，对毛主席的伟大战略部署跟得最紧，对捍卫毛主席革命路线最坚决！我们八三四一部队全体指战员向首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队学习，向首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队致敬！
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“阶级斗争，一些阶级胜利了，一些阶级消灭了。这就是历史，这就是几千年的文明史。”在首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队热情宣传和落实毛主席的最新指示的时候，一小撮阶级敌人感到他们末日的来临，怕得要死，恨得要命，挑动和蒙蔽极少数人进行破坏和捣乱。但是，首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，无限热爱红卫兵小将，他们始终高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，坚定地宣传和捍卫最高指示。
    毛主席教导我们：“将革命进行到底”。我们面前任重道远。阶级敌人决不会自动退出历史舞台，我们“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”。我们人民解放军是无产阶级专政的坚强柱石，是人民的子弟兵，我们同广大工农群众和革命的红卫兵小将、革命的师生员工永远心连心。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席，紧紧团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部周围，在无产阶级司令部的号令下，统一意志，统一步伐，统一行动，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的一系列最新指示，彻底批判反动的“多中心论”，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！我们坚决地相信，在毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的领导下，在首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队与清华大学广大革命的红卫兵小将和革命的师生员工的共同努力下，一定能把清华大学的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，一个红彤彤的毛泽东思想武装的新清华，一定会在阶级斗争的凯歌声中胜利诞生！
