Firmly Implementing Chairman Mao's Great Directive of "Grasp Revolution, Promote Production"

Shijiazhuang Iron and Steel Works Completes Annual Production Targets Ahead of Schedule and in Excess

The revolutionary committee of Shijiazhuang Iron and Steel Works, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, has fully mobilized the workers to play a leading role in the Cultural Revolution. They have smashed the plots of a handful of class enemies who attempted to split the revolutionary ranks, thereby promoting both revolution and production.

Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang, August 30th — The revolutionary committee of Shijiazhuang Iron and Steel Works, under the guidance of the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, has earnestly implemented Chairman Mao's great directive of "grasp revolution, promote production" and his latest instructions. They have continuously armed the workers with Mao Zedong Thought, fully mobilizing the workers to play a leading role in the Cultural Revolution, thereby effectively promoting both revolution and production. Building on the achievement of completing the state's annual plan ahead of schedule last year, this year they have completed the annual production targets four months and thirteen days ahead of schedule, with improved quality in both steel and steel products.

Since the establishment of the revolutionary committee of Shijiazhuang Iron and Steel Works in December last year, the entire factory has seen a great revolutionary and production situation. However, a handful of class enemies, unwilling to accept their defeat, have been hiding in the shadows, stirring up trouble, and attempting to split the revolutionary ranks. Facing the fierce attacks of a handful of class enemies, the revolutionary committee and the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team led the broad masses of revolutionary workers in workshops, production lines, and dormitories to hold various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They studied Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, mobilized the masses to expose class struggle situations, and uncovered the cover of class struggle, severely striking down a handful of class enemies. In the steelmaking and rolling mills, a handful of class enemies incited conflicts among workers, disrupting worker unity and temporarily affecting both revolution and production. The deputy director of the revolutionary committee went deep into the two workshops, studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions with the workers, conducting revolutionary criticism, and doing thorough ideological and political work. The workers said, "We have a thousand reasons to unite, and not a single reason to split." They quickly united, fought together against the enemy, and severely struck down a handful of class enemies, promoting both revolution and production.

In implementing Chairman Mao's directive of "grasp revolution, promote production," the revolutionary committee led the broad masses of workers to vigorously promote technological innovation and technological revolution. Chairman Mao taught us, "The wealth of society is created by the workers, peasants, and intellectuals themselves. As long as these people take control of their own destiny and have a Marxist-Leninist line, they will not avoid problems but will actively solve them. Any human difficulty can be overcome." The revolutionary committee and the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team organized revolutionary workers to study Chairman Mao's teachings, leading everyone to use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to severely criticize the black goods of Chinese Khrushchev's "expert management." The workers said, "Our great leader Chairman Mao trusts and relies on the working class the most. With Chairman Mao backing us, we must forge ahead in technological innovation and technological revolution, climbing peaks that no one has climbed before. No matter how great the difficulties, we can overcome them." The steelmaking workshop's power amplifier, used for heating and temperature control, is a critical component that often malfunctions and affects production. In the past, when the power amplifier broke down, they had to call in experts from outside. The maintenance workers proposed reforms many times, but were suppressed by the capitalist roaders and reactionary technical "authorities" with excuses like "high precision, cannot be tampered with." This time, the maintenance workers, with a thorough revolutionary spirit, brainstormed and came up with solutions. After multiple trials, they repaired a power amplifier in just over twenty days, mastering the maintenance technology in practice and solving a production problem. So far, the workers of this factory have completed over forty technological innovations, bringing about a new production situation.

Recently, the workers of this factory, with deep proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, have earnestly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. The leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work must be fully brought into play. The working class should also continuously improve its political consciousness in the struggle." They have decided to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, further improve their class struggle and line struggle consciousness, and in the great struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution, they will strive to achieve new victories for the people.

### 石家庄钢铁厂提前超额完成全年生产任务

    坚决贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针
    石家庄钢铁厂提前超额完成全年生产任务
    厂革委会在解放军帮助下，充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中的主力军作用，粉碎了一小撮阶级敌人妄图分裂革命队伍的阴谋，促进了革命和生产的发展
    新华社石家庄三十日电　石家庄钢铁厂革命委员会在驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，认真贯彻毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针和一系列最新指示，不断地用毛泽东思想武装工人群众，充分发挥了工人阶级在文化大革命中的主力军作用，有力地促进了革命和生产的发展。在去年提前完成国家年度计划的基础上，今年又提前四个月零十三天超额完成了全年生产任务，钢和钢材产品质量都有提高。
    石家庄钢铁厂革委会在去年十二月成立以后，全厂革命和生产呈现一派大好形势。但是，一小撮阶级敌人不甘心他们的失败，他们躲在阴暗的角落里，煽风点火，制造事端，企图分裂革命队伍。面对一小撮阶级敌人的猖狂进攻，厂革委会和解放军毛泽东思想宣传队领导广大革命职工在车间班组、厂房宿舍，举办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，学习了毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的论述，放手发动群众，大摆阶级斗争情况，大揭阶级斗争盖子，狠狠打击了一小撮阶级敌人。炼钢车间和轧钢车间一小撮阶级敌人挑拨工人之间的关系，破坏工人之间的团结，致使革命和生产一度受到影响。厂革委会副主任便深入到两个车间，和工人一块学习毛主席最新指示，一起搞革命大批判，做深入细致的思想政治工作。工人们说：“我们有一千条理由团结，没有一条理由闹分裂。”他们很快团结起来，共同对敌，狠狠地打击了一小撮阶级敌人，促进了革命和生产的发展。
    在贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”方针的过程中，厂革委会率领广大工人群众大闹技术革新和技术革命。毛主席教导我们说：“社会的财富是工人、农民和劳动知识分子自己创造的。只要这些人掌握了自己的命运，又有一条马克思列宁主义的路线，不是回避问题，而是用积极的态度去解决问题，任何人间的困难总是可以解决的。”厂革委会和解放军毛泽东思想宣传队组织革命职工学习了毛主席的教导，领导大家以毛泽东思想为武器，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫“专家治厂”等反革命修正主义黑货。工人们说：“我们伟大领袖毛主席最相信、最依靠工人阶级。有毛主席给我们撑腰，我们在技术革新和技术革命上一定要走前人没有走过的道路，要攀登前人没有攀登过的高峰，有天大的困难，我们也能克服。”炼钢车间用来加热提温的功率放大机，是这个车间的关键部位，最容易出毛病，影响生产。过去功率放大机坏了，就要到外地去请人修理。机修工人多次提出改革，都被走资派和资产阶级反动技术“权威”以“精密度高，不能随便乱动”等种种借口给压制下来。这次，机修工人发扬无产阶级彻底革命精神，大家出主意想办法，经过多次试验，仅用了二十多天的时间，就改装了一个功率放大机，在实践中掌握了维修技术，解决了生产中的一个难题。到目前为止，这个厂的职工已先后搞成技术革新四十多项，使生产出现了一个崭新局面。
    最近，这个厂的工人群众怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情，认真学习了毛主席的最新指示：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”他们决心按照毛主席的教导，进一步提高自己的阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大斗争中，为人民再立新功。
