Palestinian guerrillas have delivered a series of hard blows to the aggressors. In eight days, they launched nearly thirty attacks on Israeli aggressor forces, annihilating more than 170 enemy troops, including one American military personnel.

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Damascus on August 12, the "Fatah" (Palestine Liberation Movement) and other Palestinian nationalist organizations reported that from August 1 to August 8, Palestinian guerrillas launched nearly thirty attacks on Israeli aggressor forces, annihilating more than 170 enemy troops, including one American military personnel. During the eight days of fighting, the Palestinian guerrillas also shot down two enemy aircraft, destroyed fifteen enemy vehicles, two heavy artillery pieces, blew up an ammunition depot, several sections of railway, and a section of an oil pipeline.

The Palestinian guerrillas' operations covered the West Bank of the Jordan River, the Gaza Strip, and areas under Israeli control. Guerrillas in the Gaza Strip were particularly active. On the night of August 2, they attacked an Israeli patrol near the village of Hunan in the northeast of Gaza City, killing five enemy troops and blowing up a section of the Gaza-Kantara railway. The next day, the guerrillas blew up another section of the railway near Gabalia in the northeast of Gaza City using landmines. On August 4, the guerrillas blew up an Israeli power plant in Hunan village; an Israeli half-track vehicle that rushed to the scene was also blown up by a landmine set by the guerrillas, killing or injuring all five Israeli aggressors on board.

The guerrillas also punished the aggressors within Gaza City. On August 2, they attacked an Israeli military jeep in the city, killing four enemy troops and injuring two. Over two consecutive days, they stabbed to death two enemy patrol soldiers and injured an American military personnel on the streets of Gaza.

The "Storm" commando unit active in the West Bank of the Jordan River launched a rocket attack on an Israeli camp near Uga on the night of August 2, causing an ammunition depot there to explode. The commandos then launched an assault, annihilating twenty enemy troops, destroying an enemy mortar position, and a heavy machine gun. On August 4, a large number of Israeli aircraft invaded the Salt region on the east bank of the Jordan River, indiscriminately bombing the area. The "Storm" commandos bravely resisted, shooting down one of the aircraft. On the evening of August 5, the guerrillas attacked an Israeli position in Ein Yahav, killing or injuring twenty-five enemy troops and shooting down an Israeli helicopter. On the evening of August 6, the "Storm" commandos attacked an Israeli military outpost in Tel Hanuz, killing or injuring several enemy troops, destroying five enemy vehicles, and a heavy artillery piece. Another commando unit attacked an Israeli camp in Um Hanuz, killing or injuring several enemy troops, destroying a 106mm cannon, and three military vehicles. On August 7, the "Storm" commandos blew up an Israeli truck loaded with ammunition on the Tubas-Ramallah road in the West Bank of the Jordan River, killing the driver. The "Storm" commandos set landmines on the road south of Jericho on August 1 and 8, each time blowing up an Israeli half-track vehicle, killing or injuring all enemy troops on board.

Palestinian guerrillas also bravely fought against Israeli aggressor forces in Jerusalem, which is under Israeli occupation. On August 1, the "Storm" commandos blew up an Israeli military jeep parked in front of the Jerusalem post office with explosives, killing or injuring all personnel on board. That same night, the commandos blew up a large bar in Jerusalem City, killing or injuring more than twenty-five Israeli aggressors. On the evening of August 8, the "Storm" commandos placed two explosives in a large hotel in Jerusalem. After the first explosion, a large number of Israeli aggressors immediately rushed to the scene, sealing off the area. The second explosion then occurred, killing or injuring many Israeli aggressors.

The Israeli-controlled areas were also targets of guerrilla attacks. On August 1, the guerrillas attacked an Israeli patrol near Muzhaim in the east of Beisan, killing six enemy troops and destroying one of their half-track vehicles. The next day, they ambushed another patrol riding in an armored car in the east of Muzhaim, killing or injuring four enemy troops. In the early morning of August 4, the "Storm" commandos shelled an Israeli command post near Zara, attacking and destroying a nearby Israeli heavy machine gun position. On the evening of August 5, the "Storm" commandos attacked Israeli military positions in Yusuf Village and Tel Musha, annihilating Israeli aggressors lying in ambush nearby, and destroying several buildings on these two positions.

　　巴勒斯坦游击队狠狠打击侵略者
　　八天中向以色列侵略军发动近三十次袭击，歼敌一百七十名
    据新华社大马士革十二日电　据“法塔赫”（巴勒斯坦解放运动）和其他巴勒斯坦民族主义组织发表的战报，巴勒斯坦游击队从八月一日到八日对以色列侵略军发动了近三十次袭击，歼灭敌军一百七十余名，其中有一名美国军事人员。在八天的战斗中，巴勒斯坦游击队还击落敌机两架，击毁敌军军车十五辆、重炮两门，炸毁一座弹药库、几段铁路和一段油管。
    巴勒斯坦游击队的出击，遍及约旦河西岸、加沙地带和以色列统治区。在加沙地带的巴勒斯坦游击队特别活跃。他们二日夜里在加沙市东北的哈农村附近袭击了以色列的一支巡逻队，打死敌军五名，炸毁了加沙—坎塔拉铁路一段。第二天，游击队又在加沙市东北的加巴利亚附近用地雷炸毁了一段铁路。四日，游击队炸毁了以色列在哈农村的发电厂；事后匆忙赶到出事地点的一辆以色列半履带式车也被游击队埋设的地雷炸毁，车上的五个以色列侵略军全被炸死或炸伤。
    游击队也在加沙市内惩罚侵略者。二日，他们在市区内袭击了以色列的一辆军用吉普车，打死车上的敌人四名，打伤两名。他们连续两天在加沙大街上用匕首刺死了两名敌军的巡逻兵，刺伤了一个美国军事人员。
    活跃在约旦河西岸的“暴风”突击队，二日夜里用火箭袭击了在乌加附近的以色列兵营，使那里的弹药库发生爆炸。突击队随后发动进攻，歼灭敌军二十名，击毁敌军的一个迫击炮阵地和一挺重机枪。四日，大批以色列飞机入侵到约旦河东岸萨勒特地区滥施轰炸，“暴风”突击队英勇抗击，击落其中一架。五日晚，游击队袭击在艾因雅哈夫的以色列阵地，打死打伤二十五名敌军，击落一架以色列直升飞机。六日晚，“暴风”突击队袭击特勒汉杜兹的以色列军事哨所，打死打伤一些敌军，击毁五辆敌军车辆和一门重炮。另一支突击队袭击了在乌姆汉杜兹的以色列兵营，打死打伤若干敌军，击毁一门一○六毫米大炮和三辆军车。七日，“暴风”突击队在约旦河西岸的图巴斯一拉马拉公路上炸毁了一辆满载弹药的以色列卡车，车上的司机被炸死。“暴风”突击队在一日和八日两次在杰里科南面的公路上埋设地雷，每次都炸毁了一辆以色列半履带车，炸死炸伤车上所有的敌人。
    巴勒斯坦游击队也在被以色列侵占的耶路撒冷城里，英勇打击以色列侵略军。一日，“暴风”突击队用炸药炸毁了停在耶路撒冷邮政局前面的一辆以色列军用吉普车，把车上的人全部炸死或炸伤。当天晚上，突击队又用炸药炸了耶路撒冷城里的一家大酒巴间，炸死炸伤在那里的二十五名以上以色列侵略军。八日晚，“暴风”突击队在耶路撒冷的一家大旅馆安放了两个爆炸物。第一次爆炸后，大批以色列侵略军立刻赶到出事地点，封锁这个地区。接着又发生第二次爆炸，炸死炸伤了许多以色列侵略军。
    以色列统治区也是游击队袭击的目标。一日，游击队在贝桑以东的穆兹哈伊姆附近袭击了一支以色列巡逻队，打死敌军六名，并击毁他们的一辆半履带式车辆。第二天，他们又在穆兹哈伊姆以东伏击了乘坐装甲车进行巡逻的另一支巡逻队，打死打伤敌军四名。四日清晨，“暴风”突击队炮轰了在扎拉附近的以色列指挥部，袭击并摧毁了附近的以色列重机枪阵地。五日晚，“暴风”突击队又袭击了在优素福村和特勒穆沙的以色列军阵地，歼灭了埋伏在附近的以色列侵略军，击毁了这两个阵地上的几座建筑物。
