The great helmsman steers the ship, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought.

Over the past few years, we have been guarding the snow-capped peaks of the southwestern plateau of our motherland. Following the military thought of our great leader Chairman Mao and the series of military principles proposed by Vice Chairman Lin, we have emphasized proletarian politics, insisted on the Four Firsts, and successfully completed the task of defending our motherland. We have been rated as a model unit year after year and have been awarded the title of "Red Border Defense Team on the Plateau" by the Ministry of National Defense. We deeply feel that every bit of progress and every bit of achievement made by our unit is a great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and it is all thanks to our great leader Chairman Mao.

With Mao Zedong Thought, we can overcome all difficulties.

In 1962, we were transferred to the border of Tibet in our motherland, taking on the glorious task of defending the border at an altitude of over 5,200 meters. Here, the terrain is high, the weather is cold, the air is thin, and there are eight or nine months of frost and snow each year. Frequent gusts of wind reach seven or eight levels, and even in the best months of July, August, and September, ice pellets the size of beans fall every day. Initially, many comrades found it difficult to adapt to the environment, could not eat or sleep, felt as if their chests were stuffed with cotton, and found it hard to breathe. Some even had swelling and dizziness, as if they were seriously ill. At that time, the mountain was covered in a blanket of white snow, with nothing else. Comrades had to shovel away thick layers of snow to set up tents and collect cow dung from pastures ten kilometers away to use as fuel. Not only was it impossible to have meals on time, but even melting a pot of snow water took several hours.

Faced with so many difficulties, thoughts naturally became complicated. Some comrades wondered: Can we endure working in this place? Can we complete the mission? Some thought: Building and guarding a point here might be manageable for a short time, but it would be hard to endure for a long time. Others believed that the situation here was special and that more and better supplies should be provided, which was a work necessity, not a special demand. Faced with this situation, what should we do? The party branch brought out the resolution of the enlarged meeting of the Military Commission, chaired by Vice Chairman Lin, on strengthening political and ideological work in the army. By comparing it with the situation in the unit, we realized that these thoughts reflected not only a worldview issue but also the issue of which line to follow in building the unit and the point. Therefore, we concentrated our time to organize everyone to study the resolutions of the Gutian Conference and the enlarged meeting of the Military Commission, using the teachings of Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin on political military building to solve the fundamental issues of building and guarding the unit. During the study, everyone said: Since the establishment of our unit, we have undergone the arduous trials of "three relocations" in a short period. We carried our own tents and transported our own food up the mountain. We personally blazed a trail where no one had ever been. In this process, whenever we emphasized proletarian politics and followed the Four Firsts, everyone's morale was high, and the unit's work was lively and vibrant. Whenever we pursued bourgeois "material incentives" and put the "Four Firsts" in the wrong order, thoughts would go awry, and work would take a detour. Through study and recalling our past battles, everyone's awareness was raised, and all comrades in the unit proposed: The natural conditions are poor, so political work must be stronger. We must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

With the fundamental direction clear and thoughts unified, the party branch stipulated that three articles should be studied regularly, three historical events should be recounted regularly, and three slogans should be promoted regularly. The three articles are Chairman Mao's brilliant works, the "Three Articles." The three historical events are the history of the Long March of the Red Army, the history of the arduous struggles of the troops entering Tibet, and the history of our unit's growth after its establishment, overcoming hardships with Mao Zedong Thought in the "three relocations." The three slogans are: "Listen to Chairman Mao's words, 'The more difficult the place, the more we should go, this is a good comrade'; 'Willing to endure hardships for the people, willing to dedicate one's life to the revolution'; 'Standing on the snow-capped mountain, heart towards Tiananmen.'" As Vice Chairman Lin said: "Mao Zedong Thought, when grasped by the broad masses, will become an inexhaustible force, a spiritual atomic bomb of immense power." The entire unit insisted on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, resulting in a lively and vibrant situation where "the natural air is thin, but the political air is thick; the mountains are high, but the revolutionary spirit is higher." Soldier Xia Zuyuan initially worried that he could not endure the physical hardships and even dared not take big steps when walking. After studying the "Three Articles," he concluded: "It is not that my body cannot endure it, but that my thoughts are not firm. Like a train, if the engine has a problem, the entire train cannot move." Later, during the execution of the mission, he used the "Three Articles" to examine himself in everything. Due to the high workload and the inability to adapt to the high-altitude climate, his face swelled so much that his eyes narrowed into a line, but no one could persuade him to rest. He said: "If the body cannot endure it, relying on Chairman Mao's teachings, I am an iron man. Old Yu Gong still dug mountains every day without stopping. I am a soldier of Chairman Mao, and I can only be stronger than him." Cook Pan Rufu, unable to cook rice, boil water, or light wet cow dung, worked fifteen or sixteen hours a day, his face blackened by smoke, and his eyes red from fatigue, never complaining of tiredness or hardship. Even on the day of his discharge, he personally prepared the last meal, carried the last load of water, and fed the pigs for the last time. The car to pick up the old soldiers had already arrived at the camp gate, but he still presided over the last class meeting, sharing his experiences of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

Relying on Mao Zedong Thought, we built houses, dining halls, offices, clubs, greenhouses, water reservoirs, baths, and sports fields on the bare snow mountain with our own hands. We even raised pigs and grew vegetables. On this snow-capped peak, we not only settled down but also took root.

Insisting on Chairman Mao's military line gives us the greatest combat effectiveness.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The correct political and military lines are not naturally and peacefully produced and developed, but are produced and developed through struggle." In 1964, our unit, following the consistent teachings of Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin on political military building, had already stood firm on this snowy peak and had been rated as a model unit year after year. The military region also awarded us the honorable title of "Model Company." However, at this moment, the traitor to proletarian dictatorship, China's Khrushchev, and the counter-revolutionary revisionist element Luo Ruiqing launched wave after wave of reactionary currents. They used their usurped power to limit the publication of revolutionary treasures, Chairman Mao's works, and obstructed the workers, peasants, and soldiers from studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. On the other hand, they distributed large quantities of the black "Cultivation" to the companies, which betrayed proletarian dictatorship. They maliciously said that Chairman Mao's works were "not popular" and that workers, peasants, and soldiers "could not understand" them; that the black "Cultivation" was the best teaching material for party classes and a "required course" for party members, and so on. We clearly knew that Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental and soul of our military building. With Chairman Mao leading our revolution, with Mao Zedong Thought arming our minds, and with Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line guiding us forward, we have such a great party, a great country, a great army, and also our border defense unit. Comrades believed that no one's words could replace Chairman Mao's words, and no one's book could compare to Chairman Mao's book. Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all our work. At that time, our entire unit had only one set of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." To master Mao Zedong Thought, we, with our deep proletarian feelings of loyalty to Chairman Mao, launched a mass movement of copying, studying, and applying Chairman Mao's revolutionary treasures. Cadres copied, soldiers copied; during the day, at night; those with culture copied, and those without culture also learned to copy; from the title of each article to the annotations, every word, every sentence, and every punctuation mark were not taken lightly. Some comrades, after returning from night duty, no matter how tired or cold they were, would still copy a section of Chairman Mao's works under the dim kerosene lamp before sleeping. Soldier Lei Tianmin, who was a semi-illiterate after enlisting and had to ask others to write letters for him, copied Chairman Mao's works with his own hands and was particularly careful. He said: "This is not an ordinary book; it is Chairman Mao's treasure. I want to copy it on paper and also remember it in my heart." Soldier Zhang Yanzhou, while sick in the hospital, lay in bed unable to get up but insisted on copying over 400 quotations from Chairman Mao. This movement of copying revolutionary treasures not only greatly enhanced the class feelings of all comrades in the unit for loving Chairman Mao but also smashed the evil plot of China's Khrushchev and Luo Ruiqing to prevent us from studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought.

The resolution of the enlarged meeting of the Central Military Commission on strengthening political and ideological work in the army pointed out: "In preparing to counter imperialist aggression against us, the primary task is political and ideological preparation." However, Luo Ruiqing, this counter-revolutionary revisionist element, spread a wind of "big competitions" in the army, attempting to use "military first" and "technology first" to impact Chairman Mao's fundamental direction of political military building and Vice Chairman Lin's "Four Firsts," achieving his evil goal of usurping the military and opposing the party. Faced with this wind of "big competitions," to ensure that we do not deviate from the track of Mao Zedong Thought, the party branch organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's and Vice Chairman Lin's instructions on emphasizing political military building. We also reviewed the road our army has taken, compared the different results of emphasizing politics and emphasizing military affairs, and discussed how to view "big competitions" and why we should create model companies. Through study, everyone's minds were clear. Comrades said: The leadership of the party is the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought. The construction of the company is the construction of emphasizing proletarian politics. Only with people armed with Mao Zedong Thought is there the greatest combat effectiveness. If we only focus on military affairs and relax proletarian politics, we would deviate from the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought and put political work in the wrong position. As for whether we can be rated as a model company, everyone believed: As long as the roots of Mao Zedong Thought are deeply planted in the company, it is a solid company. Creating a model company is not for a good face or a good reputation but to use Chairman Mao's military thought to build our army into a highly proletarianized and highly combat-ready revolutionary army. The entire unit clarified these issues. Although Luo Ruiqing fiercely spread the wind of "big competitions," we always believed that emphasizing proletarian politics would never be wrong. He promoted "military first," and we promoted the "Four Firsts"; he promoted visiting "expert performances," and we learned from Liao Chujiang, Feng Fusheng, and Huang Zu's experiences of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. By doing so, our combat effectiveness was further enhanced.

Forever loyal to Chairman Mao, forever advancing along Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

The blazing fire of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally ignited by our great leader Chairman Mao, illuminated the bright path of consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, preventing capitalist restoration, and advancing towards communism. It also illuminated the bright path of strengthening grassroots construction for our border defense unit under new historical conditions. All comrades in the unit, following Chairman Mao's great battle call of "You must pay attention to national affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end," launched wave after wave of revolutionary criticism against the handful of capitalist roaders within the party, led by China's Khrushchev. Comrades said: Our border defense unit is a steel sword to defend our motherland and a cannon aimed at China's Khrushchev's bourgeois command. We not only must be ready at any time to smash the aggression of foreign enemies but also must criticize and expose China's Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionist elements Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing. Every soldier must fight to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and die to dedicate to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Chairman Mao's great battle call of "Fight selfishness and criticize revisionism" illuminated our hearts even more. After this latest instruction from Chairman Mao was transmitted, comrades studied, reflected, and implemented it. The entire unit wrote over a hundred criticism articles in one night and over a hundred letters promoting "Fight selfishness and criticize revisionism" in one month.

Almost all comrades in the unit have a "special" notebook. Whenever they see Chairman Mao's portrait or his latest instructions in newspapers and magazines, they would immediately cut them out and paste them in. Everyone said with deep emotion: "Seeing Chairman Mao's portrait, the red sun rises in my heart! Hearing Chairman Mao's words, I will not deviate from the path forward!" Soldier Chen Guozhen, on a windy and snowy night, headed to the sentry post on the snow mountain, taking deep and shallow steps, had just climbed a few meters when he slipped into the trench. He crawled and climbed, his hands numb from the cold, his feet not listening to commands, but he used "Fight selfishness and criticize revisionism" as a battle order to urge himself to climb the mountain without hesitation. After dozens of minutes of "battle," he finally reached the sentry post.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the sharp and complex class struggles in society often brought various active thoughts to cadres and soldiers. The party branch believed: Only by firmly grasping these active thoughts could the proletarian consciousness of all personnel in the unit be raised to a new level, adapt to the new requirements of class struggle, and achieve "Thousands of miles away from Beijing, but never leaving Chairman Mao's side," and stand firm, withstand, and be strong in any situation. We let cadres and soldiers often understand the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution from newspapers, radio, and letters, and bring their confused and ununderstood thoughts to seek answers in Chairman Mao's works. Whenever Chairman Mao made a call, Vice Chairman Lin gave an instruction, or the Central Committee issued a document, we would immediately organize everyone to study it. Through these activities, the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of cadres and soldiers were further enhanced. Comrades said: "We must temper ourselves in the furnace of class struggle to become stronger and dedicate everything to defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!"

    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗　把雪山哨卡建成战斗堡垒
    人民解放军西藏军区活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子代表大会先进集体、“高原红色边防队”政治指导员　张志富
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。
    几年来，我们守卫在祖国西南高原雪峰上，遵照伟大统帅毛主席的建军思想和林副主席提出的一系列建军方针原则，突出无产阶级政治，坚持四个第一，胜利地完成了保卫祖国的任务，年年被评为四好部队，并且荣获了国防部授予的“高原红色边防队”的称号。我们深深感到，全队每一点进步，每一分成绩，都是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，都要归功于伟大领袖毛主席。
    有了毛泽东思想就能战胜一切困难
    一九六二年，我们调到祖国西藏边境，在海拔五千二百米的雪山上担负保卫祖国边防的光荣任务。这里，地势高，天气冷，空气稀薄，每年有八、九个月的冰霜期，经常刮起七、八级的大风，就是在气候最好的七、八、九月份，每天还要下豆粒大的冰雹。初到这里，很多同志身体不适应，吃不下饭，睡不着觉，胸口里象塞团棉花，喘口气都很吃力，甚至有些同志身上浮肿，头昏脑胀，象生了大病。当时，山上白皑皑的一片，什么也没有。同志们得铲去很厚的积雪架帐篷，到十公里外的牧场去拣牛粪做燃料。不要说按时开饭，就是化一锅雪水，也得几小时。
    遇到这样多的困难，思想上考虑的问题就多了。有的同志想：在这个地方工作，身体吃得消吗？任务能完成吗？有人认为：在这里建点、守点，短时间还可以，时间长就受不住了；还有人认为这里的情况特殊，应该在物资供应上多一些、好一些，这是工作的需要，不是特殊要求。面临这种情况，怎么办？党支部拿出了林副主席亲自主持制定的军委扩大会议《关于加强军队政治思想工作的决议》，对照部队的情况，认为这些思想反映不但是世界观的问题，而且是用什么路线建队、建点的问题。于是，我们就集中时间，组织大家学习古田会议决议和军委扩大会议决议，用毛主席和林副主席关于政治建军的教导，来解决建队、守点的根本问题。在学习中，大家说：我们队组建后，在短短的时间里就经历了“三移防地”的艰苦锻炼，帐篷是我们自己背起走的，粮食是我们自己运上山的，从来没有人走过的地方，我们亲手开出了公路。在这个过程中，什么时候突出无产阶级政治，照四个第一办事，大家就斗志昂扬，队里的工作就热火朝天；什么时候搞资产阶级的“物质刺激”，把“四个第一”摆错了位置，思想就出“故障”，工作就走弯路。经过学习和回忆走过来的战斗历程，提高了大家的觉悟，全队同志提出：自然条件差，政治工作就要更强，我们一定要把毛泽东思想的伟大红旗握得紧紧的，举得高高的。
    根本方向明确了，思想认识统一了，党支部规定了三篇文章经常学，三段历史经常讲，三句口号经常提。三篇文章是毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”。三段历史是红军长征史、进藏部队的艰苦奋斗史、我们队组建以后用毛泽东思想战胜艰苦“三移防地”的成长史。三句口号是“听毛主席的话，‘越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志’”；“乐为人民吃大苦，愿为革命献终身”；“站在雪山顶，心向天安门”。正如林副主席说的：“毛泽东思想为广大群众所掌握，就会变成无穷无尽的力量，变成威力无比的精神原子弹。”全队坚持活学活用毛主席著作的结果，出现了一个“自然空气稀薄，政治空气浓厚；山峰高，革命斗志更高”的生动活泼的局面。战士夏祖远，初到这里担心身体受不了，连走路都不敢迈大步子。学了“老三篇”，他得出了这样的结论：“不是自己的身体受不了，而是自己的思想不过硬，象火车那样，机车出了毛病，整个列车就开不动了。”后来在执行任务中，他事事用“老三篇”对照自己，由于劳动强度大，加上不适应高山气候，他脸上肿得连眼睛都眯成了一条线，可是谁也劝不住他，说什么也不愿休息。他说：“凭身体不行，凭毛主席的教导，我就是一个铁汉，老愚公还每天挖山不止哩。我是毛主席的战士，只能比他更强。”炊事班长盘如福，饭煮不熟，水烧不开，湿牛粪点不着，每天工作十五、六个小时，脸熏成黑的，眼睛熬成红的，从来不说一声累，不叫一声苦。就是到了退伍的那天早上，他还亲自做了最后一顿饭，挑了最后一担水，喂了最后一次猪。接老战士的汽车都开到营门口了，他还主持最后一次班务会，讲活学活用毛主席著作的体会。
    靠毛泽东思想，我们用双手在光秃秃的雪山上，盖起了宿舍、食堂、办公室、俱乐部；修起了温室、蓄水池、洗澡塘、体育场；养起了猪、种起了菜。在这个雪山高峰上，我们不仅住了下来，而且扎下了根。
  坚持毛主席的建军路线就有最大的战斗力
    毛主席教导我们：“正确的政治的和军事的路线，不是自然地平安地产生和发展起来的，而是从斗争中产生和发展起来的。”一九六四年，我们队已经按照毛主席和林副主席关于政治建军的一贯教导，在这个高山雪峰上站稳了脚跟，连年被评为四好部队，军区并授予我们“四好连队标兵”的光荣称号。可是就在这个时候，中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿，却接二连三地掀起了一股股反动逆流。他们通过窃取的职权，一方面限制出版革命宝书毛主席著作，阻止工农兵群众活学活用毛泽东思想；另一方面，又把那个背叛无产阶级专政的黑《修养》，大量地发行到连队。他们胡说什么毛主席著作“不通俗”、工农兵“学不懂”；黑《修养》是党课的最好教材、是党员的“必修课”等等。我们清楚地知道，毛泽东思想是我们建军的根本，建军的灵魂，有毛主席领导我们革命，有毛泽东思想武装我们的头脑，有毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引我们前进，才有我们这样伟大的党、伟大的国家、伟大的军队，也才有我们这个边防部队。同志们认为，谁的话也代替不了毛主席的话，谁的书也比不上毛主席的书，毛泽东思想是我们一切工作的指导方针。那时，我们全队只有一套《毛泽东选集》，为了把毛泽东思想学到手，我们怀着无限忠于毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情，开展了热火朝天的大抄、大学、大用毛主席革命宝书的群众运动。干部抄，战士抄；白天抄，晚上抄；有文化的抄，没有文化的也学着抄；从每一篇文章的题目，到每一篇文章的注释，每个字，每句话，每个标点，都不马虎。有的同志深夜下岗回来，不管多么累、多么冷，也要在微弱的煤油灯下，抄一段毛主席著作才睡。战士雷天民，是一个入伍后才开始学文化的半文盲，写家信都请别人代笔，可是抄毛主席著作，不但自己动手，而且一笔一划地特别认真。他说：“这不是一般的书，这是毛主席的宝书，我要抄在纸上，更要记在心里。”战士张彦洲，生病住医院，躺在床上不能起来，还坚持抄了四百多条毛主席语录。这次抄写革命宝书的运动，不但极大地增强了全队同志热爱毛主席的阶级感情，同时也粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫和罗瑞卿不让我们活学活用毛泽东思想的罪恶阴谋。
    中央军委扩大会议《关于加强军队政治思想工作的决议》中指出：“在做好准备迎击帝国主义向我发动战争的一切工作中，首要的是政治思想准备。”可是罗瑞卿这个反革命修正主义分子，却在部队里刮起了一股“大比武”的妖风，妄图用“军事第一”、“技术第一”，冲击毛主席关于政治建军和林副主席关于“四个第一”的根本方向，达到他篡军反党的罪恶目的。在这股“大比武”妖风面前，为了一步也不离开毛泽东思想的轨道，党支部针对当时的问题，组织大家学习毛主席和林副主席关于着重政治建军的指示，并且回顾我军所走过的道路，对比突出政治和突出军事的不同结果，又讨论了怎样看待“大比武”，为什么要创造四好连队等问题。通过学习，大家心明眼亮了。同志们说：党的领导就是毛泽东思想的领导，连队的建设就是突出无产阶级政治的建设，有了用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，才是最大的战斗力。如果我们只抓军事，放松无产阶级政治，就是离开了毛泽东思想的领导，就是摆错了政治工作的位置。至于能不能评上四好连队，大家认为：只要毛泽东思想的根子在连队扎得深，就是一个过硬的连队。创造四好连队不是为了面子好看、名声好听，而是为了用毛主席的建军思想，把我军建设成为非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的革命军队。全队明确了这些问题，尽管罗瑞卿使劲刮起“大比武”的妖风，但我们始终坚信突出无产阶级政治绝对不会错。他搞“军事第一”，我们就搞“四个第一”；他搞参观“尖子表演”，我们就学习廖初江、丰福生、黄祖示活学活用毛主席著作的经验。我们这样做，战斗力更加增强了。
    永远忠于毛主席，永远沿着毛主席的
          革命路线奋勇前进
    我们伟大领袖毛主席亲手点燃的无产阶级文化大革命的烈火，照亮了巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，通向共产主义的光辉道路。也照亮了我们边防队在新的历史条件下，加强基层建设的光辉道路。全队同志遵照毛主席“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的伟大战斗号召，向以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮最大的走资派，掀起了一次又一次革命大批判的高潮。同志们说：我们这个边防队就是保卫祖国的一把钢刀，就是指向中国赫鲁晓夫资产阶级司令部的一门火炮。我们不仅要随时准备粉碎国外敌人的侵略，更要把中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿批倒批臭。我们每个战士要生为捍卫毛主席的革命路线而战斗，死为捍卫毛主席的革命路线而献身。
    毛主席的“要斗私，批修”的伟大战斗号召，把我们全队同志的心照得更亮了。毛主席的这一最新指示传来后，同志们边学习、边对照、边落实。全队在一个夜晚就写了一百多篇批判稿件，一个月内写了一百多封宣传“要斗私，批修”的信件。
    全队绝大多数同志都有一本“特备”的笔记本，见到报刊上的毛主席像和刊登的毛主席的最新指示，就随时剪贴起来，抄写进去。大家无限深情地说：“见到毛主席像，心中升起红太阳！听了毛主席的话，前进路上不转向！”战士陈国贞，在一个风雪交加的夜里去上岗，朝着雪山的哨位，深一脚浅一脚地前进，刚往上走了两三米，就滑到堑壕里去了。他爬呀，上呀，两只手冻得麻木了，两只脚不听指挥了，他就把“要斗私，批修”作为奋勇前进的战斗号令，督促自己不顾一切地往山上爬去，经过几十分钟的“战斗”，终于到达了哨位。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，社会上尖锐、复杂的阶级斗争，经常给干部、战士们带来各种活思想。党支部认为：只有大抓狠抓这些活思想，才能把全队人员的无产阶级觉悟提高到新水平，才能适应阶级斗争新形势的要求，才能做到“离北京千山万水，跟毛主席寸步不离”，才能在任何情况下站得稳、顶得住、过得硬。我们让干部、战士经常从报纸上、广播里、家信中，了解无产阶级文化大革命的形势，带着思想上的模糊认识和不理解的问题，从毛主席著作中求答案。毛主席一有号召，林副主席一有指示，中央一发表文件，就组织大家立即学习。通过这些活动，干部、战士的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟进一步提高了。同志们说：“我们要在阶级斗争的熔炉里，把自己锻炼得更坚强，为捍卫毛主席的革命路线献出一切！”
