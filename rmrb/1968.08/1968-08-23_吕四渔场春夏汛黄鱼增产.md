Jiangsu Province's Lvsi Fishery saw a bumper harvest of large and small yellow croakers during this spring and summer fishing season, with the total yellow croaker production increasing by 23 percent compared to the same period last year.

The bumper harvest of yellow croakers during the spring and summer fishing season at Lvsi Fishery is a result of the widespread promotion of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. During the fishing season, under the leadership of the fishery's revolutionary production committee, the broad masses of fishermen followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. They organized Mao Zedong Thought study classes on the boats, intensively focused on the struggle between the two classes, two lines of thought, and two paths, significantly raising the fishermen's awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. They overcame difficulties in production such as bad weather, low water temperatures, and irregular fish migrations. They worked hard, endured hardships, and frequently tested and opened their nets, achieving a bumper harvest of yellow croakers during the spring and summer fishing season.

Recently, the fishery's revolutionary production committee mobilized the broad masses of fishermen and revolutionary cadres to summarize their experiences in combining revolution with production. They are striving for even greater harvests in the second half of the year and during the winter fishing season for tuna.

    吕四渔场春夏汛黄鱼增产
    江苏省吕四渔场今年春夏汛大小黄鱼生产获得丰收，黄鱼总产量比去年同期增产百分之二十三。
    吕四渔场春夏汛黄鱼生产喜获丰收，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想大普及的结果。鱼汛期间，在渔场革命生产委员会的领导下，广大渔民紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，大办船头毛泽东思想学习班，狠抓两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，广大渔民的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟有了很大提高。他们在生产上克服了天气不好，水温低，鱼群回游不规律等困难，不怕苦，不怕累，勤试网，勤开网，取得了春夏汛黄鱼生产的大丰收。
    最近，渔场革命生产委员会发动广大渔民和革命干部，总结了抓革命、促生产的经验，为夺取下半年和冬汛带鱼生产更大丰收而斗争。　（据新华社讯）
