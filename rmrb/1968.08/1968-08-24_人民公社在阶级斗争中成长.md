	Editor's Note: Ten years ago, the people's commune, this new social organization, rose like the morning sun from the eastern horizon. Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out with great wisdom: "The people's commune is good!" This is the greatest support and encouragement for the socialist enthusiasm of hundreds of millions of peasants. For ten years, Chairman Mao's great voice has been inspiring the broad masses of commune members to forge ahead. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the people's commune has withstood all severe tests and fully demonstrated its unparalleled superiority and strong vitality. The brilliant facts of the people's commune growing and strengthening have given the domestic and foreign class enemies one slap in the face after another.

	Today, in the midst of the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, commemorating the tenth anniversary of the birth of the people's commune has great practical significance.

	The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of the Suanzhuyu Production Brigade, Han Zhuang People's Commune, Pinggu County, Beijing, are full of revolutionary enthusiasm. They talk about the tremendous changes that have taken place since the establishment of the people's commune through their personal experiences.

	The People's Commune Grows Amid Class Struggle

	Production Brigade Leader Wang Ruijiang

	The people's commune was born, grew, and strengthened in the storm of class struggle.

	When the people's commune was just established, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents maliciously said that the people's commune was established "too early" and had "gone wrong." The capitalist roaders and untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists also parroted, shaking their heads and wagging their tongues, cursing the people's commune. During the period of temporary economic difficulties, they spread the "three freedoms and one contract" and the theory of "extinguishing class struggle," plotting to dismantle the collective economy of the people's commune. They arbitrarily expanded private plots, opened up "ten edges" land, and engaged in speculation, embezzlement, and theft. They also promoted "work points in command" and "material incentives" and other black goods, trying to undermine the foundations of socialism.

	This group of ghosts and snakes thought they could get away with it, but we, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, would never allow it! At that time, I was the brigade leader of Suanzhuyu. I stood firmly with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and fought resolutely against the class enemies. At a brigade meeting, I proposed to reclaim the "ten edges" land. The capitalist roaders and bad elements bared their fangs and brandished their claws, launching a fierce attack on me, threatening, "If Wang Ruijiang is not overthrown, the 'ten edges' land cannot be farmed!" They also used the pretext of "caring for the livelihood of the commune members" to incite some uninformed masses to file complaints to the commune, the county, and even the State Council. The old county committee also sent people to interrogate me, trying to intimidate me. At that time, some well-meaning people advised me, "A wise man does not take a loss in front of his eyes. Don't make trouble like this." I replied loudly, "With Chairman Mao, I am not afraid of anything!" Whenever I had the chance, I would speak out against the dangers of "three freedoms and one contract" and "four freedoms," educating the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and commune members, raising their class consciousness, and finally reclaiming all the "ten edges" land for the collective.

	At present, our brigade has a vibrant new look, and the Mao Zedong Thought school of the people's commune is getting better and better.

    编者按：十年前，人民公社这个新的社会组织，象初升的太阳，从东方地平线上升起的时候，我们的伟大领袖毛主席就极其英明地指出：“人民公社好”！这是对亿万农民的社会主义积极性的最大支持和最大鼓舞。十年来，毛主席的伟大声音，一直在鼓舞着人民公社的广大社员奋勇前进。在毛主席无产阶级革命路线的指引下，人民公社经受住一切严峻的考验，充分显示出她的无比的优越性和强大的生命力。人民公社不断成长壮大的光辉事实，给了国内外阶级敌人一个又一个响亮的耳光。
    今天，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，纪念人民公社诞生十周年，具有重大的现实意义。
    北京地区平谷县韩庄人民公社酸枣峪生产大队的贫下中农和革命干部，在纪念人民公社诞生十周年时，满怀革命豪情，以自己的亲身经历，畅谈人民公社化以来的巨大变化。
    人民公社在阶级斗争中成长
    大队负责人　王瑞江
    人民公社是在阶级斗争的暴风雨中诞生、成长、壮大的。
    人民公社刚成立，中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人就胡说什么人民公社“办早了”，“搞糟了”。走资派和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子也象鹦鹉学舌一样，摇头晃脑地咒骂人民公社。在经济暂时困难时期，他们大肆鼓吹“三自一包”，“阶级斗争熄灭”论，阴谋拆散人民公社集体经济。他们擅自扩大自留地，大开“十边”地，大搞投机倒把、贪污盗窃活动。他们还推行“工分挂帅”、“物质刺激”等黑货，拚命挖社会主义墙脚。
    这群牛鬼蛇神想得倒美，可我们广大贫下中农坚决不答应！当时，我是酸枣峪的生产大队队长，我和广大贫下中农紧紧地站在一起，同阶级敌人作了坚决的斗争。在一次队委会上，我提出收回“十边”地，走资派和坏分子张牙舞爪向我展开了围攻，扬言“不打倒王瑞江，‘十边’地就种不成！”他们还打出“关心社员生活”的幌子，煽动一些不明真相的群众，到公社、县里甚至到国务院告状。旧县委也派人传讯我，妄图把我吓倒。这时候，有些好心人劝我说：“好汉不吃眼前亏，你别这样闹了。”我响亮地回答：“有毛主席，我啥都不怕！”一有机会，我就大讲“三自一包”、“四大自由”的危害，教育广大贫下中农和社员群众，提高阶级觉悟，终于把“十边”地全部收归集体了。
    当前，我们大队出现了生气勃勃的新气象，人民公社这座毛泽东思想大学校越办越好。
