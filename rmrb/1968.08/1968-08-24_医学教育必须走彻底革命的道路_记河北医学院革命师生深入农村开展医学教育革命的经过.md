In mid-March of this year, more than 1,400 revolutionary teachers and students of Hebei Medical College, with the strong support of the military personnel stationed on campus for military training, took Mao Zedong's "May 7th Directive" as their guideline and Mao Zedong's directive to "shift the focus of medical and health work to rural areas" as their guiding ideology. They went to six counties in rural areas to carry out a thorough revolution in medical education. In the mountains, semi-mountainous areas, and plains, they deeply carried out the revolution in medical education. Over the past few months, in the process of carrying out the revolution in medical education in rural areas, they have thoroughly criticized and repudiated the revisionist medical education line, thoroughly established the proletarian medical education line, and from all aspects of medical education, they have firmly grasped the direction of facing rural areas and serving five hundred million peasants. They have continuously deepened the revolution in medical education, achieving initial experience in education in rural areas.

Medical education has countless things to change, but the most fundamental issue is to solve the question of facing whom and serving whom.

Hebei Medical College was established in 1915. At the time of liberation, this college was a mess handed over by the reactionary Kuomintang. After liberation, a small clique of capitalist roaders and bourgeois intellectuals within the Party had long dominated this school, and the poison of the feudal, capitalist, and revisionist medical education line was quite deep. After the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began, the broad revolutionary masses of Hebei Medical College seized power from them, successively achieved revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination, and established a revolutionary committee.

After the revolutionary committee was established, in response to the past situation where medical education was detached from reality, after research, they proposed an initial teaching reform plan: to move 200 beds from the affiliated hospital to the medical college; to let students go to the affiliated hospital for internships in batches. As soon as this plan was put forward, it immediately sparked a heated debate. Some said, this is a thoroughly revolutionary plan, solving the problem of teaching detached from clinical practice; others said, this plan lacks the spirit of thorough revolution, and is a "two-move" plan of moving the "master" hospital to the "young master" medical college and moving the "young master" medical college to the "master" hospital. Moving back and forth, it still does not leave the city, the hospital, and the school. Doing so does not conform to the direction of Mao Zedong's educational revolution.

The debate among revolutionary teachers and students immediately attracted the high attention of the revolutionary committee and the military training personnel. They believed: this is a very important debate on principles, relating to the direction and future of the revolution in medical education, and also relating to whether we can carry out the revolution in medical education to the end. To better solve this problem, the entire school organized 240 different types of study classes. In the study classes, everyone repeatedly studied Mao Zedong's "May 7th Directive" and his directives on medical work. The more they studied, the more they felt there was a problem with this plan. Mao Zedong taught, "Shift the focus of medical and health work to rural areas," but the focus of this medical education revolution plan is still on the city; Mao Zedong also taught, "The question of for whom is a fundamental question, a question of principle.... If this fundamental question is not solved, many other questions will also be difficult to solve," but this plan did not grasp the fundamental question of facing whom and serving whom. Everyone unanimously agreed: medical education has countless things to change, but the most fundamental issue is to change the direction of facing whom and serving whom; only by grasping this fundamental question and carrying out struggle-criticism-transformation, can the revolution in medical education develop in the correct direction, otherwise, it will go astray.

Based on fully mobilizing the masses, the revolutionary committee proposed a new teaching reform plan: to go to rural areas to carry out the revolution in medical education and fundamentally solve the question of facing whom and serving whom. As soon as this new plan was proposed, it immediately received the enthusiastic support and firm support of the revolutionary teachers and students of the entire school, but it also suffered vicious attacks and sabotage from a small clique of capitalist roaders and bourgeois reactionary "authorities" within the college. They incited, "Going to the countryside, there are no instruments, no equipment, what can be used for teaching practice?" "Going to the countryside, the mountains are high, the roads are far, and the villages are sparse, it's hard to encounter a patient in a few days, what can be learned?" "Going to the countryside, you will learn to be half-farmer and half-doctor, are you still a college student?" Under the incitement of class enemies, some students also had some vague understandings.

To repel the enemy's fierce attack and further educate the revolutionary teachers and students, the revolutionary committee and military training personnel first mobilized revolutionary old cadres, old teachers, and old workers to speak extensively about the history of the struggle between the two lines at Hebei Medical College over the past 17 years; then, they mobilized the masses to extensively expose the new situation, new characteristics, and new trends of the current class struggle, and to expose the cover of class struggle on the medical and educational front. They also seized and struggled against the class enemies who were fanning the wind and setting the fire from behind. Through these activities, everyone realized: the struggle between the two lines on the medical and educational front, in the past and now, is still closely centered around the fundamental question of facing where and serving whom; whether the medical college is in the city, serving a few urban masters, or in the countryside, serving five hundred million peasants, this is the focus of the long-term struggle between Mao Zedong's proletarian medical line and the counter-revolutionary revisionist medical line of China's Khrushchev. Eighty percent of China's population is in rural areas, to truly solve the question of facing whom and serving whom, we should follow Mao Zedong's teachings and go to the countryside, taking the road of combining with the poor and lower-middle peasants.

After a fierce struggle, the understanding was finally unified. In mid-March, more than 1,400 revolutionary teachers and students of the entire school broke through the overlapping administrative structure and old class system, organized according to the medical and educational team composition, and stepped out of the school gate, going to the vast rural areas of six counties.

Directly participating in class struggle and production struggle in rural areas is the fundamental way to transform students' thinking.

From the city to the countryside is a profound revolution, and from being in the countryside to being heart-to-heart with the poor and lower-middle peasants, establishing the thought of serving the poor and lower-middle peasants for life, and always being an ordinary laborer, is an even more profound revolution.

The revolutionary teachers and students of each medical and educational team immediately threw themselves into the practice of class struggle and production struggle in rural areas as soon as they arrived in the countryside.

In the practice of class struggle, the broad revolutionary teachers and students further solidified the political direction of medical education facing rural areas and serving five hundred million peasants. Why should the focus of medical and health work be shifted to rural areas? How should medical education serve proletarian politics? Although students in the college building had discussed these issues for a long time, they still did not understand deeply. After going to the countryside, the problem of thinking was still not thoroughly solved. Many students still thought: doing medical and health work in the city and in the countryside is the same, treating diseases is treating diseases, and revolution is revolution. Is the problem so simple? Everyone found the answer in their contact with reality.

When carrying out the universal investigation and treatment work, they first investigated the situation (the situation of medical and health work in rural areas), and then investigated the class struggle situation on the medical and health front in rural areas; they first investigated the crimes of the revisionist medical and health line pushed by China's Khrushchev in rural areas. In the investigation, they understood one village by visiting one village, and they understood one household by visiting one household. When they arrived at the village, they asked the village-level cadres and grassroots medical and health workers to introduce the class struggle situation on the medical and health front in rural areas; when they arrived at the household, they listened to the poor and lower-middle peasants' exposure and accusations against the revisionist medical and health line. From the introduction of the village-level cadres and the accusations of the poor and lower-middle peasants, students clearly understood that due to the lack of medical and health personnel and medicines in rural areas caused by the counter-revolutionary revisionist medical and health line pushed by China's Khrushchev, the medical and health power in many rural areas had been usurped by class enemies and bad people. These people were either Kuomintang officers and spies, or reactionary sect leaders and sect masters, or cheating witch doctors. They used the medical and health power they had stolen to extort and take revenge on the poor and lower-middle peasants. Some pressed yeast tablets worth five fen into flour and sold them for eight yuan per pack, some used poisonous prescriptions to kill poor and lower-middle peasants who had divided their land during the land reform, and some used the opportunity of practicing medicine to first pull the village cadres down into the water, and then through this cadre who had fallen into the water, they controlled the power of the Party, government, finance, and culture in the village.

The living class struggle facts made everyone deeply realize: for whom medical education serves is to serve the politics of that class; China's Khrushchev's efforts to oppose and resist education serving proletarian politics are to serve bourgeois politics, allowing a small clique of class enemies to monopolize the medical and health power in rural areas and restore capitalism. Based on the universal investigation and understanding, on the one hand, they together with the poor and lower-middle peasants exposed and struggled against a small clique of class enemies on the medical and health front in rural areas, and on the other hand, they together with the poor and lower-middle peasants carried out a thorough criticism of the revisionist medical and educational line. The students of the 9th Medical and Educational Team, after rescuing a poor and lower-middle peasant's child who was almost killed by a "treated" rich farmer doctor in Xiuwei Village, Xiuyi Commune, Xiu County, immediately went door-to-door to mobilize the masses to struggle against this rich farmer element, and held seven consecutive criticism meetings of the revisionist medical and educational line in the patient's home. At the criticism meeting, the patient's family and students together accused the various crimes of the revisionist medical and health line pushed by China's Khrushchev. Students deeply felt: "Only at this time did we truly understand why it is necessary to shift the focus of medical and health work to rural areas and how medical education should serve proletarian politics. Whether we come to the countryside or not, whether we serve the poor and lower-middle peasants or not, this is not a specific problem of treating diseases here or there, but a problem of revolution or not, a problem of seizing power or not." Everyone called this kind of criticism meeting a "criticism meeting at the storm of class struggle." In three months, each medical and educational team held more than 200 such criticism meetings.

In the practice of production struggle, they decided to establish the thought of always being an ordinary laborer and always serving the poor and lower-middle peasants. Lightly regarding ordinary labor, lightly regarding ordinary laborers, especially lightly regarding ordinary laborers engaged in agricultural production, is a relatively common wrong thought among college students. They neither want to be an ordinary laborer nor want to serve ordinary laborers. In the past, many students in Hebei Medical College pursued the "three bigs" (going to big cities, entering big hospitals, becoming big doctors), avoiding the "three smalls" (going to small villages, entering small clinics, becoming small doctors). To solve this problem, the revolutionary committee and military training personnel, based on Mao Zedong's teaching of "combining education with productive labor," included participating in productive labor as a compulsory course in the teaching plan.

After teachers and students went to the countryside, in addition to running small factories and planting experimental fields themselves, they mainly participated in agricultural production with the poor and lower-middle peasants. During the spring plowing, they plowed the land and built ridges with the poor and lower-middle peasants; during sowing, they carried water and fought drought with the poor and lower-middle peasants. In the past, many students thought: ordinary labor is nothing special, anyone can do it. But now, when they actually did it, it was not as simple as they imagined. Especially when students' shoulders were swollen, hands were rubbed raw, and waists were sore, they felt even more that ordinary labor was not ordinary. Students said well: rolling in the mud, getting closer to the class feelings of the poor and lower-middle peasants.

The sharp and complex class struggle, the hard and ordinary productive labor, every moment was testing and tempering the students who went to the countryside. Through this test and tempering, students loved Mao Zedong more, loved the poor and lower-middle peasants more, and loved labor more. To bring medical services to the poor and lower-middle peasants, they would climb any mountain and go any distance. They climbed mountains over 2,000 meters above sea level; they walked to deep mountain valleys with only a few households. There were no doctors in rural areas, so they trained half-farmer and half-doctor health workers for the poor and lower-middle peasants; there were few medicines in rural areas, so they went up the mountains to pick herbs, reclaimed wasteland to grow medicines, and made medicines themselves. Seeing these scenes, the poor and lower-middle peasants were all moved to say: "You are truly the doctors sent by Chairman Mao to serve us poor and lower-middle peasants!"

To establish the thought of serving the poor and lower-middle peasants, one must go to the countryside; to learn the true skills of serving the poor and lower-middle peasants, one must also go to the countryside. The revolutionary teachers and students of Hebei Medical College deeply felt this in the process of carrying out medical and educational practice in rural areas.

When they first arrived in the countryside, many teachers and students doubted whether they could carry out teaching well and learn true skills in the countryside. They said: it is feasible to carry out ideological revolutionization in the countryside, but it is not necessarily feasible to carry out teaching in the countryside, and it is likely that not much true skill can be learned. The reason is: the learning conditions in the city are good, and the learning conditions in the countryside are poor.

What is true skill? Where can this true skill be learned? What are the most favorable learning conditions? The many facts they encountered in the countryside gave a very powerful answer to this question.

As soon as the revolutionary teachers and students of this college arrived in the countryside, they decided to use their greatest strength to relieve the suffering of diseases for the poor and lower-middle peasants. However, as soon as they actually did it, problems were quickly exposed. Originally, the things they learned in the college building were seriously detached from the reality of the countryside. The things most needed by the poor and lower-middle peasants, such as common and frequently occurring diseases in rural areas, they had not learned or had learned very little; while the things they had learned were, due to various conditions, mostly not usable in rural areas. A poor and lower-middle peasant came to the students to treat trachoma, and seven students in the graduating class did not know how to treat it. Because this simple common disease was not in the university textbook, and the teacher had never taught it in the classroom. Another poor and lower-middle peasant came to the students to check for roundworm disease, and no student dared to make a diagnosis. Because in the past, they learned to use a microscope to check feces in school, and now, as soon as they left the microscope, they were at a loss.

The most educational for everyone was the treatment of a four-year-old child with burns covering more than 60% of his body. After the mother brought the crying child, five students in the graduating class of the 8th Medical and Educational Team decided to treat the child's burns well. However, how to rescue him? Everyone flipped through this textbook, it was to send to an absolutely sterile room and use ultraviolet rays; flipped through that textbook, it was still to send to an absolutely sterile room and use ultraviolet rays. The students angrily threw the book and said: "The things we learned in the past are completely useless in rural areas to serve the poor and lower-middle peasants!" After throwing away the books, the students circled around the child several times, anxiously and helplessly. At this time, the burned child cried even more, and the child's mother pleaded: "Doctor, please treat the child quickly, look at how painful the child is!" The students, feeling both ashamed and indignant, stomped their feet and said: "It's not that we don't want to treat the child, but China's Khrushchev made us learn that set of things, and we can't treat the child's disease without the city!" Just as everyone was anxious, a rural health worker ran over. He looked at the child's condition and used a commonly used local folk remedy to give the child some medicine, applying it to the child's burns. After 15 minutes, the child stopped crying, after three days, scabs formed, and after a week, it was completely healed. Afterwards, the students and this rural health worker gathered together and held a profound criticism meeting specifically on this issue. At the criticism meeting, the students were all excited to say: what is true skill? The skill to serve the poor and lower-middle peasants is true skill! Where can this true skill be learned? Only in the countryside, through practice, taking the road of combining education with productive labor, can such true skill be learned! What are the most favorable conditions for us to learn this true skill? It is most convenient to connect with rural reality for teaching in the countryside, and this is the most favorable condition for our learning!

Practicing, criticizing, and reforming at the same time is the main method of this college's revolutionary teachers and students to carry out teaching reform in rural areas. They paid attention to understanding the needs of the poor and lower-middle peasants at any time and in any place, and paid attention to soliciting the opinions of the masses at any time and in any place. At the beginning of the mobile medical treatment, the students of the 5th Medical and Educational Team wrote ten prescriptions for the patients of a village in one day, mostly penicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, and vitamins. According to the students' words, they were all "good" medicines for the poor and lower-middle peasants. However, they quickly found that seven of these ten prescriptions were hung on the wall by the poor and lower-middle peasants and were not taken. Why were the prescriptions written but not taken? They went door-to-door to solicit the opinions of the masses. An old peasant said: "Thanks to Chairman Mao's blessings, sending you to treat diseases for us poor and lower-middle peasants, but perhaps you have been in big cities for too long, not understanding our feelings as poor and lower-middle peasants, writing a prescription is several yuan, we poor and lower-middle peasants can't afford to spend so much money for a little illness!" The old peasant's words made every student think deeply: yes, we have been living in the city for a long time, always surrounded by those urban masters and so-called high-level intellectuals, how can we understand the feelings of the poor and lower-middle peasants? Without understanding their feelings, how can we better serve them? It's a small prescription, but it reveals two different service directions! To further solve the direction of service, the students extensively understood the feelings and lives of the poor and lower-middle peasants, learned their hardworking and thrifty excellent traditions, and gradually changed their feelings. Feelings changed, and prescriptions also changed. Afterwards, when they wrote prescriptions for the poor and lower-middle peasants, they rarely used the old set of medicines, but mainly used the folk remedies and prescriptions collected from the poor and lower-middle peasants, which were effective and welcomed by the poor and lower-middle peasants, achieving the effect of spending less money to treat big diseases; not spending money, also treating diseases. The acupuncture, massage, and cupping that were once looked down upon and thrown away by college students are now listed as the key content of teaching and important methods of treatment. They created a new "small cup therapy" based on the principles of acupuncture and cupping, which was very popular among the poor and lower-middle peasants. In terms of teaching content, whatever the poor and lower-middle peasants needed, they increased it a lot; conversely, they reduced it a lot. Now they have listed more than 100 common and frequently occurring diseases in rural areas and universally existing diseases as the key content of teaching.

Starting from the reality of the countryside, they gradually learned the skills to treat diseases under the existing conditions. Generally, rural areas do not have microscopes, X-rays, or laboratories, so they explored new methods to check diseases. In the past, teaching checked roundworm disease using the method of checking feces with a microscope, now they use the method of observing the patient's eyes and tongue. Generally, rural areas do not have high-level operating rooms in cities, so they combined performing operations such as "ectopic pregnancy" and "splenectomy" to explore methods to perform such large operations in simple operating rooms in rural areas or in patients' homes. The revolutionary teachers and students of the 6th Medical and Educational Team, when carrying out medical and educational activities in Xiaojiaping Village, Xiaojiaping Commune, Ping Mountain County, lived in the room where Norman Bethune lived, read Mao Zedong's "In Memory of Norman Bethune," walked the road that Norman Bethune walked, and used the simple operating room that Norman Bethune used (two ordinary civilian houses). In this simple operating room, they overcame various difficulties and performed nine relatively large operations. Everyone said: "Learning such skills, they can serve the poor and lower-middle peasants in rural areas in peacetime and serve the wounded and sick on the battlefield in wartime, in line with the spirit of Chairman Mao's instructions on being prepared for war, being prepared for famine, and serving the people!"

"Learning war from war," learning to treat diseases in the process of treating diseases for the poor and lower-middle peasants, this is their main method of teaching in rural areas. Using this method to teach, it fundamentally changes the past phenomenon of teaching detached from clinical practice and clinical practice detached from rural areas. After each medical and educational team went to the countryside, they organized teachers and students into several small groups (each group has about ten people). Each small group is both a medical group and a teaching group. Where there are patients, they go there to treat; where they treat, they teach there. The bedside of the patient, the field of labor, the rural health station, and small hospital are all the places where they treat diseases for the poor and lower-middle peasants and the classrooms where they teach. Arriving at the patient's bedside, they first ask the patient to talk about the cause and symptoms of the disease; then the teacher or the grassroots medical worker in the countryside diagnoses and treats while explaining; the students listen and ask questions on the side, and do with the teacher. In general, treating the same disease, the first and second times are treated and explained by the teacher; the third and fourth times are treated and explained by the students. The teacher becomes the student, and the student becomes the teacher, teaching and learning from each other, benefiting each other. Practice has proved that adopting such a teaching method not only solves the problem of teaching detached from rural reality but also ensures that students can quickly and well learn the true skills of serving the poor and lower-middle peasants. For example, 30 first-year students of the 5th Medical and Educational Team, after studying in school for a year, not to mention treating diseases, they had not even come into contact with patients. In the short period of more than two months in the countryside, they had treated diseases for more than 600 patients with the teacher, learned the diagnostic and treatment methods of 42 diseases, and compiled all these treatment methods into textbooks. Students are full of confidence to say: just like we are learning now, the school system can be greatly shortened, and in two or three years, we can learn what we could not learn in five years in the past.

The revolutionary teachers and students of Hebei Medical College went to the countryside to carry out the revolution in medical and education, directly participating in the practice of the three great revolutionary movements in rural areas, and began to walk on the road of combining intellectuals with workers and peasants. In all aspects, a series of fundamental changes have taken place. The stand of the broad revolutionary teachers and students is changing, their feelings are changing, and the direction of medical education service is also changing. These changes, although only just beginning, they all strongly feel: their direction is correct, their path is right; under the guidance of the latest instructions of Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line and educational revolution, walking on this path, a completely new type of medical college facing rural areas will definitely be established.

    医学教育必须走彻底革命的道路
    ——记河北医学院革命师生深入农村开展医学教育革命的经过
    今年三月中旬，河北医学院一千四百多名革命师生，在解放军驻校军训人员的大力支持下，以毛主席的“五·七”指示为纲，以毛主席“把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村去”的指示为指导思想，分别下到六个县的广大农村，在山区、半山区、平原区深入开展医学教育革命。几个月来，他们在农村开展医学教育革命的过程中，大破了修正主义医学教育路线，大立了无产阶级医学教育路线，从医学教育的各个环节上，狠抓了面向农村、为五亿农民服务这个大方向，不断地把医学教育革命引向深入，取得了在农村办学的初步经验。
      医学教育有千条万条要改，最根本
  的是要解决面向谁和为谁服务的问题
    河北医学院是一九一五年建立的。解放时，这个学院是从国民党反动派手里接收过来的一个破烂摊子。解放后，学院党内一小撮走资派和资产阶级知识分子，一直统治着这个学校，封、资、修医学教育路线的流毒比较深。史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命开始以后，河北医学院的广大无产阶级革命派夺了他们的权，先后实现了革命的大联合和革命的三结合，成立了革命委员会。
    革命委员会成立后，针对过去医学教育脱离实际的情况，经过研究，提出了一个教学改革的初步设想方案：从附属医院搬二百张病床到医学院来；让学生分批轮流到附属医院实习。这个方案一拿出来，立即引起了一场激烈的争论。有的说，这是个彻底革命的方案，教学脱离临床的问题解决了；有的说，这个方案没有彻底革命的精神，是把“老爷”医院搬到“少爷”医学院，“少爷”医学院搬到“老爷”医院的“两搬家”方案，搬来搬去，还是没有离开城市，没有离开医院，没有离开学校，这样做，不符合毛主席教育革命的大方向。
    革命师生的这一场争论，立即引起了革命委员会和军训人员的高度重视。他们认为：这是一场极其重要的原则性争论，关系到医学教育革命的方向和前途问题，也关系到能否将我们的医学教育革命进行到底的问题。为了使这场争论能够更好地解决问题，全校共办起了二百四十个不同类型的学习班。在学习班里，大家反复学习了毛主席的“五·七”指示和对卫生工作的指示。他们越学越感到这个方案有问题。毛主席教导说，要“把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村去”，而这个医学教育革命方案的重点仍然放在城市；毛主席又教导说，“为什么人的问题，是一个根本的问题，原则的问题。……这个根本问题不解决，其他许多问题也就不易解决”，而这个方案却没有抓住面向谁、为谁服务这个根本问题。大家一致认为：医学教育有千条万条要改，最根本的是要从面向谁、为谁服务这个大方向的问题上改；抓住了这个根本问题进行斗批改，才能使医学教育革命沿着正确的方向向前发展，否则，就会走到邪路上去。
    革命委员会在充分发动群众的基础上，又提出了一个新的教改方案：到农村去进行医学教育革命，从根本上解决面向谁、为谁服务的问题。这个新的方案一提出，立即得到了全院广大革命师生的热烈拥护和坚决支持，同时也遭到了学院党内一小撮走资派和资产阶级反动“权威”的恶毒攻击和极力破坏。他们煽动说：“到农村去，一没仪器，二没设备，拿什么去进行教学实践？”“到农村去，山高路远村子稀，几天碰不到一个病人，能学到啥东西？”“到农村去，让你学个半农半医的水平，还算不算大学生？”在阶级敌人的煽动下，有一些同学也产生了一些模糊认识。
    为了击退阶级敌人的猖狂进攻，进一步教育广大革命师生，革命委员会和军训人员首先发动革命的老干部、老教员、老职工，大讲河北医学院十七年来两条路线斗争的历史；然后，又发动群众大摆当前阶级斗争的新形势、新特点、新动向，大揭当前医教战线上阶级斗争的盖子，并揪斗了在背后煽阴风、点鬼火的阶级敌人。通过这些活动，使大家认识到：医教战线上两条路线的斗争，过去是，现在仍然是紧紧围绕着面向那里、为什么人服务这个根本问题展开的；医学院是在城市办，为少数城市老爷服务，还是在农村办，为五亿农民服务，这就是毛主席的无产阶级医疗路线同中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义医疗路线长期斗争的焦点。我国人口的百分之八十在农村，要真正解决面向谁、为谁服务的问题，就应当遵照毛主席的教导，到农村去，走与贫下中农相结合的道路。
    经过一场激烈的斗争，终于统一了认识。三月中旬，全院一千四百多名革命师生，打破了重叠的行政机构和旧的班级组系，按照医教连队的编制，走出校门，分别下到了六个县的广大农村。
      在农村直接参加阶级斗争和生产斗争
  的实践，是转变学生思想的根本途径
    从城市到农村，是一场深刻的革命，从身到农村到与贫下中农心连心，树立为贫下中农服务一辈子的思想，永远当一个普通劳动者，则是一场更加深刻的革命。
    各个医教连队的革命师生一到农村，就立即投入到农村的阶级斗争和生产斗争的实践中去。
    在阶级斗争的实践中，广大革命师生进一步坚定了医学教育要面向农村、为五亿农民服务的政治方向。为什么要把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村去？医学教育怎样为无产阶级的政治服务？同学们在学院的大楼里，虽然专就这些问题讨论了很长时间，但仍然理解不深。下到农村以后，思想问题还没有彻底解决。有不少同学总是这样认为：在城市和在农村做医疗卫生工作都是一样，在哪儿都是治病，在哪儿都是革命。问题是不是这样简单呢？大家在同实际接触中找到了答案。
    在进行普查普治工作时，他们查情况（农村的医疗卫生工作情况），首先查农村医疗卫生战线上阶级斗争的情况；查病情，首先查中国赫鲁晓夫所推行的修正主义医疗卫生路线在农村犯下的滔天罪行。在调查中，他们走一村就了解一村，过一户就访问一户。到了村里，就请农村基层干部和基层医疗卫生工作人员，介绍农村医疗卫生战线上阶级斗争情况；到了户里，就听取贫下中农对修正主义医疗卫生路线的揭发和控诉。从农村基层干部的介绍和贫下中农的控诉中，同学们清楚地了解到，由于中国赫鲁晓夫推行的反革命修正主义医疗卫生路线所造成的农村缺医少药的情况，使不少农村的医疗卫生大权被阶级敌人和坏人篡夺了。这些人，有的是国民党的军官、特务，有的是反动会道门的道徒、道首，有的是骗人的巫婆流医。他们利用所窃取的医疗卫生大权，对贫下中农进行敲诈勒索和阶级报复。有的把五分钱的酵母片压成面卖八块钱一包，有的用毒药方害死了土改时分过他家土地的贫下中农，还有的利用行医的机会先把农村干部拉下水，然后又通过这个下水的干部掌握农村的党、政、财、文大权。
    活生生的阶级斗争事实，使大家深刻认识到：医学教育为谁服务，就是为那个阶级的政治服务；中国赫鲁晓夫之所以千方百计地反对和抵制教育为无产阶级政治服务，就是为资产阶级政治服务，让一小撮阶级敌人独霸农村的医疗卫生大权，复辟资本主义。在普遍调查了解的基础上，他们一方面和贫下中农一起共同揪斗了农村医疗卫生战线上一小撮阶级敌人，一方面和贫下中农一起开展了对修正主义医教路线的大批判。医教九连的同学们，在无极县泗水公社小吕村抢救出了一个被戴帽的富农医生“治”得快要死去的贫下中农子弟后，立即挨门挨户地发动群众斗争了这个富农分子，并在病人家里连开了七次对修正主义医教路线的批判会。在批判会上，病人家属和同学们一起控诉了中国赫鲁晓夫所推行的修正主义医疗卫生路线的种种罪行。同学们深有体会地说：“只有在这时候，我们才真正理解了为什么一定要把医疗卫生工作的重点放到农村去，到底医学教育怎样为无产阶级政治服务。我们到不到农村来，为不为贫下中农服务，这不是在这里看病，还是在那里看病的具体的问题，而是一个革命不革命的问题，夺权不夺权的问题。”大家都管这种批判会叫做“阶级斗争风浪口上的批判会”。在三个月的时间里，各个医教连队共开了二百多次这样的批判会。
    在生产斗争的实践中，他们决心树立永远当一个普通劳动者，永远为贫下中农服务的思想。轻视普通劳动，轻视普通劳动者，特别是轻视从事农业生产的普通劳动者，这是在大学生中存在的一个较普遍的错误思想。他们既不愿做一个普通劳动者，又不愿为普通劳动者服务。过去，河北医学院有不少同学追求
  “三大”（到大城市，进大医院，当大大夫），回避“三小”（到小农村，进小卫生所，当小医生）。为了解决这个问题，革命委员会和军训人员根据毛主席“教育与生产劳动相结合”的教导，把参加生产劳动作为一门正课，列入到教学计划中。
    师生到农村后，除了自己开办小工厂，种试验田外，主要是和贫下中农在一起参加农业生产。春耕时，他们和贫下中农一起翻地打埂；播种时，他们又和贫下中农一起挑水抗旱。过去，许多同学认为：普通劳动没有什么了不起的，谁都干得了。可是，现在实际一干，并不象他们所想象的那样简单。特别是当同学们的肩膀压肿，手磨破，腰累疼了的时候，才更加感到普通劳动不普通了。同学们说得好：泥巴滚一身，和贫下中农的阶级感情近一分。
    尖锐复杂的阶级斗争，艰苦平凡的生产劳动，每时每刻都在考验和锻炼着下乡的同学。通过这种考验和锻炼，同学们更加热爱毛主席，更加热爱贫下中农，更加热爱劳动了。为了给贫下中农送医上门，他们不论山有多高也要爬，不论路有多远也要去。拔海二千多米的高山，他们爬上去了；只住着几户人家的深山沟，他们走到了。农村缺医，他们就为贫下中农培养半农半医的卫生员；农村少药，他们就为贫下中农上山采药，开荒种药，自己制药。贫下中农看到这些情景后，都感动地说：“你们真是毛主席派来的，为咱贫下中农服务的好医生！”
      紧密结合农村实际，边治病、边教学，
  是学习为贫下中农服务真本领的最好方法
    要树立为贫下中农服务的思想，必须到农村去，要学习为贫下中农服务的真本领，也必须到农村去。河北医学院革命师生在农村进行医疗和教学实践的过程中，对这个问题的体会越来越深刻。
    刚到农村的时候，不少师生对在农村能否搞好教学，学到真本领，抱怀疑态度。他们说：在农村搞思想革命化行，在农村搞教学不见得行，恐怕学不到多少真本领。理由是：城市的学习条件好，农村的学习条件差。
    究竟什么是真本领？在哪里才能学到这种真本领？最有利的学习条件是什么？他们在农村碰到的许多事实，十分有力地回答了这个问题。
    这个学院的革命师生一到农村，都决心拿出最大的力量为贫下中农解除疾病的痛苦。可是，他们实际一干，问题就很快暴露出来了。原来他们在学院大楼里学的那些东西，严重地脱离了农村实际。贫下中农最需要的东西，如农村的常见病多发病，他们没有学或很少学；而他们学了的东西，又因为种种条件的限制，在农村又大都用不上。一个贫下中农来找同学们治沙眼病，毕业班的七个同学都不知道怎样处治。因为这种简单的常见病，大学教材上根本没有，教师在课堂上从来也没有讲过。又一个贫下中农找同学们检查是否有蛔虫病，同学们谁也不敢确诊。因为过去在学校里学的是用显微镜检查大便的方法，现在一离开显微镜，就傻了眼。
    对大家教育最深的，是处治一个全身烫伤面积达百分之六十以上的四岁小孩。当母亲把哭叫着的孩子抱来后，医教八连的五名毕业班的同学，都决心把这个孩子的烫伤治好。可是到底怎样抢救呢？大家翻翻这个教材，是送绝对无菌室，用紫外线照射；翻翻那个教材，还是送绝对无菌室，用紫外线照射。气得同学们把书一扔说：“我们过去学的这些东西，根本就不能在农村为贫下中农服务！”丢开书本后，同学们围着孩子转了一圈又一圈，干着急，没办法。这时烫伤的孩子哭得更厉害了，孩子的妈妈恳求说：“大夫，快给孩子治治吧，你们看孩子痛得多难受呀！”同学们又惭愧又气愤地把脚一跺说：“不是我们不给孩子治，是中国赫鲁晓夫叫我们学的那一套东西，离开城市就不能给孩子治病啊！”大家正在着急的时候，一位农村的卫生员跑来了。他看了一下小孩的病情，就用当地常用的土法给孩子配了些药，抹在小孩的烫伤处。过了十五分钟，小孩就不哭了，过了三天就结痂了，过了一周就全好了。事后，同学们和这位农村卫生员凑在一块，专就这个问题开了一次深刻的批判会。在批判会上，同学们都激动地说：什么是真本领？能为贫下中农服务的本领就是真本领！究竟在那里才能学到这种真本领？只有在农村通过实践，走教育与生产劳动相结合的道路，才能学到这样的真本领！什么是我们学习这种真本领的最有利条件？在农村最便于联系农村实际进行教学，这就是我们学习的最有利的条件！
    边实践、边批判、边改革，是这个学院的革命师生在农村进行教学改革的主要方法。他们随时随地注意了解贫下中农的需要，随时随地注意征求群众的意见。刚开始进行巡回医疗时，医教五连的同学，一天内就给一个村的贫下中农病人开了十个处方，大都是盘尼西林、金霉素、链霉素、维生素。按同学们的说法，都是给贫下中农开的“好”药。可是他们很快发现，这十个处方有七个被贫下中农挂在墙上，没有去取药。为什么开了处方不取药？他们挨门逐户地征求群众的意见。一位贫农老大伯说：“托毛主席他老人家的福，派你们来给咱们贫下中农治病，可同学们兴许在大城市里呆惯了，不了解咱贫下中农的心情，提笔开一张药方就是好几块钱，咱贫下中农可舍不得有点病就花那么多钱啊！”老大伯的一席话，引起了每个同学的深思：对呀，过去我们成年住在城市，天天围着那些城市老爷和所谓高级知识分子转，怎么会了解贫下中农的这种思想感情呢？不了解他们的思想感情，又怎么能更好地为他们服务呢？真是一张小药方，道出了两个不同的服务大方向啊！为了进一步解决服务方向问题，同学们广泛地了解了贫下中农的思想感情和生活，学习他们艰苦朴素的优良传统，使自己的思想感情逐渐发生了变化。思想感情变了，处方也就变了。以后，他们再给贫下中农开处方时，就很少用过去那一套了，而是主要用从贫下中农那里搜集来的，行之有效的、很受贫下中农欢迎的土方和验方，做到了少花钱，治大病；不花钱，也治病。过去被大学生看不起，扔在一边的针灸、按摩、拔火罐，现在被他们列为教学的重点内容和治病的重要方法。他们根据针灸和火罐的原理，创造了一种新的“小罐疗法”，很受贫下中农的欢迎。在教学内容上，凡是贫下中农需要的东西，他们就大增特增；反之，就大砍特砍。现在他们已把一百多种农村的常见病多发病和普遍存在的病，列入到教学的重点内容中。
    从农村的实际出发，他们逐步学会在现有条件下医治疾病的本领。一般农村没有显（显微镜）、光（爱克斯光）、验（化验室），他们就探索新的检查疾病的方法。过去教学检查蛔虫病，是用显微镜检查大便的方法，现在就用观察病人的眼睛和舌头的方法。一般农村没有城市那样的高级手术室，他们就结合做“宫外孕”、“脾切除”等较大的手术，探索在农村的简易手术室里或病人的家里做这样大手术的方法。医教六连的革命师生在平山县卸甲河公社卸甲河村开展医教活动时，住的是白求恩住过的房，读的是毛主席《纪念白求恩》的书，走的是白求恩走过的路，用的是白求恩用过的简易手术室（两间普通民房）。在这个简易手术室里，他们克服了种种困难，先后做了九次较大的手术。大家说：“学会了这样的本领，平时可以在农村为贫下中农服务，战时可以上战场为伤病员服务，符合毛主席提出的备战、备荒、为人民的指示精神！”
      “从战争学习战争”，在为贫下中农治病的过程中学习治病，这是他们在农村进行教学的主要方法。用这样的方法进行教学，就从根本上改变了过去那种教学脱离临床、临床脱离农村的现象。各个医教连队下到农村以后，把师生混合编成若干小组（每个小组有十人左右）。每个小组，既是医疗小组，又是教学小组。哪里有病人，他们就到哪里去治疗；在哪里治疗，就在哪里进行教学。病人的床头，劳动的田间，农村的卫生所、小医院，都是他们为贫下中农治病的地方和进行教学的课堂。到了病人的床边，他们先请病人讲病因病症；然后由老师或农村的基层卫生工作人员边诊断治疗，边进行讲解；同学们在一旁边看，边听，边问（提问题），边和教师一起干。在一般情况下，治疗同一种病，第一、二次由教师先治、先讲；第三、四次则由学生先治先讲。教师当学生，学生也当教师，师生互教互学，教学相长。实践证明，采取这样的教学方法，不仅解决了教学脱离农村实际的问题，还保证了同学们能又快又好地学到为贫下中农服务的真本领。如医教五连一年级的三十个同学，在学校学习了一年，别说治病，连病人也没接触过。在下乡短短的两个多月的时间内，他们就和教师一起为六百多个病人治了病，学会了四十二种病的诊断治疗方法，并且把这些治疗方法，全都编写成了教材。同学们都充满信心地说：就象我们现在这样学下去，学制完全可以大大缩短，在二、三年的时间内，完全可以学到过去五年所学不到的东西。
    河北医学院的革命师生到农村去进行医教革命，直接参加了农村三大革命运动的实践，开始走上了知识分子同工农群众相结合的道路，在各个方面都发生了一系列的根本变化。广大革命师生的立场在变，思想感情在变，医学教育的服务方向也在变。这些变化，虽然还仅仅是开始，但他们都强烈地感觉到：他们的方向选准了，他们的路子走对了；在毛主席无产阶级教育路线和教育革命的最新指示的指引下，沿着这条道路走下去，一个面向农村的、完全新型的医学院校，定能创立出来。
