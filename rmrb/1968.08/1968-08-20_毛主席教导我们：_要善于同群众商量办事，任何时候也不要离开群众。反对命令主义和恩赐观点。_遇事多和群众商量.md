Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must be good at consulting with the masses on matters, and never leave the masses. Oppose commandism and the idea of granting favors."

Consult with the Masses on Matters

Li Rongchang, Head of the Passenger Transport Workshop of Beijing Railway Station

This spring, our workshop encountered the following incident: due to work needs, the workshop needed to add a few deputy squad leaders. After the revolutionary committee discussed and proposed a list, should we still consult with the masses? I mentioned this to a standing committee member, thinking that the time was tight and that there were no major objections to these comrades in daily life, so it would be fine to just announce it to everyone. However, after I announced it in one squad, comrades immediately raised criticisms, saying, "Since you've decided, why are you asking for our opinions?" Some comrades also pointed out sharply, "This is a new organization, but an old way of doing things!"

Comrades' criticisms gave me a great shock. "From the masses, to the masses" is the fundamental line for all our work, and it is the invincible proletarian revolutionary line. We communists, in carrying out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, should consult with the masses on matters. The Chinese Khrushchev represents the interests of the Kuomintang reactionaries, seeing himself as the "savior" of the masses, practicing "tutelage" over the masses, advocating that his bourgeois command consisting of traitors, spies, and capitalist-roaders should grant favors and issue orders. This is a typical Kuomintang style. The masses are the true heroes. Any correct ideas, plans, opinions, and methods of leadership can only come from the masses and be realized by consulting with the masses. If we do not rely on the masses, we cannot even run a single train.

I thought some matters could be handled without consulting the masses, but this incident gave me a good lesson. Our station, from the revolutionary committee to the members of various levels of leadership groups, also took this as a lesson. In the future, we will always consult with the masses when handling matters, actively accept the masses' criticisms and supervision, and resolutely implement the mass line of "from the masses, to the masses" in all our work.

    毛主席教导我们：“要善于同群众商量办事，任何时候也不要离开群众。反对命令主义和恩赐观点。”
    遇事多和群众商量
    北京车站客运车间领导小组长　李荣昌
    今年春天，我们车间发生了这样一件事：由于工作需要，车间里要增加几个副连长。经革命委员会讨论，提出了一个名单。这还要不要同群众商量呢？我同一位常委说了一下，认为时间比较紧，平时大家对这些同志也没有多少意见，只要跟大家宣布一下就行了。谁知我在一个连里宣布后，同志们就纷纷提出批评，说：“你们既然定了，还向我们征求什么意见。”有的同志还一针见血地指出：“这是新机构，旧作风！”
    同志们的批评给了我很大震动。“从群众中来，到群众中去”的群众路线，是我们做一切工作的根本路线，是无往不胜的无产阶级革命路线。我们共产党员执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就应该遇事多和群众商量。中国赫鲁晓夫代表国民党反动派的利益，把自己看作是群众的“救世主”，对群众实行“训政”，主张由他那个由叛徒、特务、走资派组成的资产阶级司令部来恩赐和发号施令，这是地地道道的国民党作风。群众是真正的英雄。任何领导的正确思想、计划、意见、办法只能从群众中来，同群众商量着办才能实现。如果不依靠群众，就连一列火车也不能开动。
    我以为有些事可以不同群众商量，结果把事情办糟了。这件事给我一个很好的教育。我们车站从革委会到各级领导小组成员，也以此为教训，以后办事就经常同群众商量，主动地接受群众的批评和监督，坚决在一切工作中贯彻“从群众中来，到群众中去”的群众路线。
