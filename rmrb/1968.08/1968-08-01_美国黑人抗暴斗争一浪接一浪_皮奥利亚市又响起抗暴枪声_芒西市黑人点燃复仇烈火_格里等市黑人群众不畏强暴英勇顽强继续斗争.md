The black struggle against violence in the United States continues to surge in waves across various cities. As the waves of struggle in Cleveland and Greenville have not yet subsided, gunshots echoing the black resistance have once again been heard in Peoria, Illinois, and other places.

In the early morning of July 30, fascist police in Peoria arbitrarily arrested two black individuals. This act of brutality sparked intense outrage among local blacks, who took to the streets to confront the police. Cornered and desperate, the police called in reinforcements to brutally suppress the black community. The blacks fought back, smashing and burning numerous stores and cars owned by white racists with stones and Molotov cocktails. Armed blacks also opened fire on the police, engaging in a fierce gun battle that lasted approximately three hours, injuring about ten fascist police officers and delivering a new heavy blow to the U.S. reactionary ruling clique.

At the same time that gunshots echoed in Peoria, a black resistance struggle also erupted in Muncie, Indiana. On July 30, white racist elements in Muncie openly and without provocation shot and injured a 13-year-old black girl, sparking public outrage among local blacks, who took to the streets and set fire to multiple locations with homemade incendiary devices in retaliation.

In Greenville, Indiana, despite the reactionary authorities reimposing a curfew and conducting mass arrests on the night of July 29, the brave and tenacious black community showed no fear of these suppression measures and continued their struggle with even greater resolve. Around 9 PM on July 29, just as the city began to reimpose the curfew, black snipers opened fire, damaging a police car. By the morning of July 30, large numbers of black youth in Greenville were still fighting in the streets, setting fire to stores and cars owned by white racists. The city's police chief admitted helplessly, "The situation is continuing to deteriorate."

The struggle of blacks in Seattle, Washington, is also developing, with the situation extremely tense. Seattle Mayor James Braman exclaimed, "We are sitting on a powder keg, and we will be sitting on it for many years."

Additionally, on July 30, black resistance struggles of varying scales occurred in Kalamazoo, Michigan, and Oakland, California.

　　美国黑人抗暴斗争一浪接一浪
　　皮奥利亚市又响起抗暴枪声　芒西市黑人点燃复仇烈火
　　格里等市黑人群众不畏强暴英勇顽强继续斗争
    新华社三十一日讯  华盛顿消息：美国黑人抗暴斗争的浪潮正在一浪接着一浪地在各地兴起。克利夫兰和格里等城市的黑人斗争怒潮还未平息，伊利诺斯州皮奥利亚市等地又响起了黑人抗暴的枪声。
    皮奥利亚市的法西斯警察在三十日清晨无故逮捕了两个黑人。这种暴行引起了当地黑人的强烈愤慨，他们纷纷起来对警察进行质问。理屈词穷的警察竟召来大批增援者对黑人进行残酷的镇压。黑人们奋起反击，他们还用石块和燃烧瓶砸烂和烧掉了许多白人种族主义者的商店和汽车。许多带枪的黑人还向警察开枪射击，经过约三个小时的激烈枪战，击伤了约十名法西斯警察，给了美国反动统治集团以新的沉重打击。
    在皮奥利亚市响起黑人抗暴枪声的同时，在印第安纳州的芒西市也爆发了黑人抗暴斗争。三十日，芒西市的白人种族主义分子竟公然无故开枪打伤一名年仅十三岁的黑人女孩，引起了当地黑人的公愤，他们纷纷走上街头，用自制燃烧弹在多处点起了复仇的烈火。
    在印第安纳州的格里市，尽管反动当局在二十九日晚又重新宣布戒严，并且进行了疯狂的大逮捕，但是英勇顽强的黑人群众对这些镇压措施毫不畏惧，他们继续更坚决地进行战斗。在二十九日晚九时许，这个市刚开始再次实行宵禁时，黑人狙击手就开枪击坏了一辆警车。直到三十日清晨格里市的大批黑人青年仍在街上进行斗争，放火烧掉一些白人种族主义者的商店和汽车。这个市的警察头子无可奈何地承认，“局势在继续恶化”。
    华盛顿州西雅图市黑人的斗争也仍在发展，局势非常紧张，西雅图市市长布拉曼惊呼，“我们正坐在火药桶上，并且将坐好多年”。
    此外，密执安的卡拉马祖市和加利福尼亚的奥克兰市，在三十日都发生了规模不等的黑人抗暴斗争。
