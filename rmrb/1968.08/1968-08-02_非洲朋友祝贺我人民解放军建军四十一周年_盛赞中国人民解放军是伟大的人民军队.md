On the eve of the 41st anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army, a friend from Mali and an African worker in Mauritania each sent a letter of congratulations expressing their admiration for Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people. They also enthusiastically praised the People's Liberation Army, which was personally founded by Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin Biao, as a great army.

A friend from Mali wrote in his letter: "Chairman Mao is the most reliable and resolute leader of the Chinese people and all proletarian revolutionaries worldwide, leading them in the struggle for the liberation of the oppressed peoples and the elimination of imperialists and their lackeys who are cornered everywhere in the world."

The friend from Mali also wrote: "The People's Liberation Army is the army of the people, serving the people. It is a strong pillar for the people of all countries in their struggle against imperialism, old and new colonialism, and their lackeys (including revisionists). The People's Liberation Army and the glorious Chinese people are the strongest bastion in the struggle against the exploiters of all peoples. The letter wishes the People's Liberation Army greater achievements in fulfilling its mission."

The friend from Mali concluded his letter: "Long live Sino-Malian friendship! Advance bravely for the liberation of the peoples of all countries! Long live the great red sun, Chairman Mao!"

An elderly African worker in Mauritania also enthusiastically praised the People's Liberation Army as a great army in his letter. He said: "This army was founded by the greatest Marxist-Leninist thinker of our time, and it is a true people's army."

He said: "The People's Liberation Army not only fought against external enemies but also remains vigilant, ready to drive away any enemy that dares to attack the People's Republic of China." He said: "The People's Liberation Army is the pillar of the Cultural Revolution and an active propagandist of Mao Zedong Thought. It is loyal to and will always be loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, executing Chairman Mao's instructions under the wise command of Vice Chairman Lin Biao."

He said: "The soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, the technicians, and the workers of China, due to their loyalty to their leader, have broken the nuclear monopoly of the imperialists and the Soviet revisionists."

The worker cited examples of heroes like Dong Sheng and Li Wenzhong, who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, saying: "The People's Liberation Army, which is loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, shows us that they are loyal to the people and love the people, setting an example for us."

He concluded: "Long live Mao Zedong Thought! Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Long live the People's Liberation Army!"

　　非洲朋友祝贺我人民解放军建军四十一周年
　　盛赞中国人民解放军是伟大的人民军队
    新华社一日讯　在中国人民解放军建军四十一周年的前夕，一位马里朋友和一位在毛里塔尼亚的非洲工人分别写贺信表示他们对中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席的崇敬心情，并热烈赞扬由毛主席亲自缔造的、林彪副主席直接指挥的中国人民解放军是一支伟大的军队。
    一位马里朋友在信中写道：“毛主席是中国人民和全世界无产阶级战士的最可靠、最坚决的统帅，领导着他们进行争取被压迫人民的解放，消灭已在世界各地走投无路的帝国主义者及其走狗的斗争。”
    这位马里朋友还写道：“中国人民解放军是人民的子弟兵，是为人民服务的，它是各国人民抗击帝国主义、新老殖民主义及其走狗（包括修正主义）的坚强支柱。中国人民解放军和光荣的中国人民是抗击各国人民的剥削者的斗争中的最坚强的堡垒。”贺信祝愿中国人民解放军在履行自己的任务中取得更大的成就。
    这位马里朋友在贺信中最后写道：“中马友谊万岁！为争取各国人民的解放而奋勇前进！伟大的红太阳毛主席万岁！”
    在毛里塔尼亚的一位非洲老工人在贺信中热烈赞扬中国人民解放军是一支伟大的军队。他说：“因为这支军队是由当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义思想家所缔造的，这是一支真正的人民军队。”
    他说：“中国人民解放军不是仅仅抗击了外来敌人，而且她始终保持警惕，准备再一次赶走胆敢进攻中华人民共和国的任何敌人。”他说：“中国人民解放军是文化大革命的支柱，是毛泽东思想的积极宣传者。她忠于并将永远忠于毛泽东思想，她在林彪副主席的英明指挥下执行毛主席的指示。”
    他说：“中国人民解放军指战员、中国的技术人员和工人，由于对自己的领袖的忠诚，已经打破了帝国主义者和苏修的核垄断。”
    这位工人在信中，列举无限忠于毛主席的门合、李文忠等英雄为例说：“忠于毛泽东思想的中国人民解放军向我们表明，他们是忠于人民和热爱人民的，为我们树立了榜样。”
    他最后写道：“毛泽东思想万岁！”“敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！”“中国人民解放军万岁！”
