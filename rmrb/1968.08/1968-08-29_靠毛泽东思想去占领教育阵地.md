	Relying on Mao Zedong Thought to Seize the Educational Front

	Editor Comrade:

	These past few days, my heart has been filled with indescribable joy. When I received the notice to join the worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team, I was so excited that I couldn't eat or sleep. Looking at Chairman Mao's portrait, tears of joy streamed down my face.

	I am an ordinary female worker. Since the age of eleven, I have been a child laborer. In the old society, I couldn't eat enough or keep warm, living a life worse than that of cattle and horses. After liberation, under the nurturing of the Party, I joined the Party, became an advanced producer, and even saw our beloved great leader Chairman Mao, which is the greatest happiness of my life. Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "We must fully mobilize the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in all work." This is Chairman Mao's greatest trust, support, encouragement, and exhortation to us, the working class. Wherever Chairman Mao points, I will go. Now, our worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team has marched into colleges and universities in a grand and majestic manner.

	The university is a long-standing bastion of bourgeois rule. Under the bourgeois educational system, some university students look down on us workers and peasants, thinking they are extraordinary, and their thoughts and feelings are completely different from ours. Some children of peasant and worker origin, after studying for a few years in such universities, return home and refuse to work or farm, isn't this a betrayal of their roots? Therefore, when my eldest child finished high school, my husband (a poor peasant) and I decided not to let him go to university but to send him to join the army instead. Who would have thought that now I myself am going to enter a university, and this time, I am entering the university with the historical mission entrusted to us by Chairman Mao, on behalf of the entire class, to seize the educational front with Mao Zedong Thought. I will definitely follow Chairman Mao's teachings and complete the glorious task of the proletarian educational revolution.

	I have worked for nearly thirty years, and I am familiar with the temper of the spinning frame. Now I am going to deal with intellectuals, and I asked myself: Can I do it? The answer is definitely: "Yes!" I have never been to school since I was a child and only read a few years of night school after liberation, so I have very little "ink" to my name. However, I have experienced a lot of class struggle and production struggle, and especially through this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I have felt more deeply that as long as we firmly grasp Mao Zedong Thought as the most sharp weapon, we can be invincible! "The proletariat must not only liberate itself but also liberate all of humanity. If the proletariat cannot liberate all of humanity, it cannot ultimately liberate itself." If we, the working class, do not thoroughly carry out the proletarian educational revolution in schools, do not uproot the revisionist roots, capitalism may be restored, and we will once again be oppressed and exploited, suffering again. Thinking of this, I feel that I have boundless energy! I must fight this hard battle! In the struggle, I will continuously improve my political awareness and, together with the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and the revolutionary students, teachers, and workers of the school, jointly carry out the entire struggle, criticism, and transformation of the university, and swear to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!

### 靠毛泽东思想去占领教育阵地

    靠毛泽东思想去占领教育阵地编辑同志：
    这几天，我心里真有说不完的高兴。当我接到参加工人毛泽东思想宣传队的通知时，激动得吃不下饭、睡不着觉，对着毛主席像，流出了热泪。
    我是一个普通的女工，从十一岁起就当童工，在旧社会里吃不饱、穿不暖，过着牛马不如的生活。解放后，在党的培养和哺育下，我入了党，当上了先进生产者，还见到了我们日夜想念的伟大领袖毛主席，这是我终生最大最大的幸福。毛主席最近指出：“要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。”这是毛主席对我们工人阶级的最大信任、最大支持、最大鼓舞、最大鞭策。毛主席指向哪里，我一定奔向哪里。现在，我们工人毛泽东思想宣传队，已经浩浩荡荡、昂首阔步开进了大专院校。
    大学，这是一个长期被资产阶级统治的顽固堡垒。在资产阶级教育制度下培养出来的大学生，有的就看不起我们工人，也看不起贫下中农，自以为“了不起”，思想感情与我们工农格格不入。有的工农出身的子弟，在那样的大学里读了几年书，回来不肯做工种田，这不是忘本吗？因此，我的一个大孩子读到高中以后，我和我的爱人（贫农社员）商量，决定不让他读大学，而送他去参军了。想不到现在我自己却要进大学，而且这次进大学，是带着毛主席赋予我们的历史使命，受了整个阶级的委托去的，是要用毛泽东思想去占领教育阵地。我一定要按照毛主席的教导，很好地完成无产阶级教育革命这个光荣的战斗任务。
    我做过近三十年工，平时摸熟了细纱机的脾气，现在要去和那些知识分子打交道，我曾问自己：行不行？回答是肯定的：“行！”我从小没有进过一天学堂，解放后才读了几年夜校，“喝”的墨水很少，但是，经历过的阶级斗争和生产斗争不算少，特别是通过这场无产阶级文化大革命，我更深切地感到，只要牢牢地掌握毛泽东思想这个最锐利的武器，就能无往而不胜！“无产阶级不但要解放自己，而且要解放全人类。如果不能解放全人类，无产阶级自己就不能最后地得到解放。”如果我们工人阶级不把学校中的无产阶级教育革命搞彻底，不挖掉修正主义根子，资本主义就可能复辟，我们也就要重新受压迫、受剥削，要重吃二遍苦。想到这里，我就觉得浑身有使不完的劲！我一定要打好这个硬仗！在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟，和解放军战士以及学校的革命的学生、革命的教师、革命的工人一起，共同搞好大学的全部斗、批、改，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
