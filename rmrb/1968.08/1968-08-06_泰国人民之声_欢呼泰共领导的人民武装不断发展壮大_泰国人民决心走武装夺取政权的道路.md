"The Voice of the Thai People" radio station broadcasted an article on August 3rd stating that the Thai people's armed struggle over the past three years has proven that the Thai Communist Party's resolute leadership in guiding the Thai people to take the path of surrounding the cities from the countryside and seizing power through armed struggle is the only correct path to victory for the Thai revolution.

The article states that under the correct leadership of the Thai Communist Party, the Thai people's armed forces are rapidly developing and growing stronger. They have repeatedly smashed the counter-revolutionary "encirclement and suppression" campaigns of the U.S.-Thanom clique and are increasingly frequently and proactively annihilating the enemy's forces, dealing heavy blows to the U.S.-Thai reactionaries.

The article points out that the Thanom-Babo traitorous clique, under the orders of U.S. imperialism, is stepping up the use of force to suppress the people's armed forces in an attempt to extinguish the flames of the people's armed struggle. However, their attempts at suppression have been repeatedly smashed. The people's armed forces not only have not been eliminated but have rapidly developed and grown stronger in the struggle against the enemy's "encirclement and suppression." This fully demonstrates the invincible power of the people's armed forces and exposes the paper tiger nature of the U.S.-Thanom clique.

The article states that the U.S.-Thanom clique is attempting to use political deception, issuing a fake constitution and preparing to hold fake elections to divert the direction of the Thai people's revolutionary struggle and lure the Thai people into abandoning armed struggle. However, the Thai people are resolutely continuing the armed struggle, foiling the enemy's plots. Under the heavy blows of the people's armed struggle, the ruling position of the Thanom-Babo traitorous clique is becoming increasingly unstable.

The article emphasizes that the Thai people's revolutionary armed struggle, under the correct leadership of the Thai Communist Party, is guided by Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and is a just patriotic struggle. It has gained the support of the broad masses of the Thai people. Therefore, no matter how difficult and tortuous the struggle may be, ultimate victory will surely belong to the Thai people.

　　“泰国人民之声”欢呼泰共领导的人民武装不断发展壮大
　　泰国人民决心走武装夺取政权的道路
    新华社五日讯　“泰国人民之声”电台三日广播一篇文章指出，泰国人民三年来武装斗争的实践证明：泰国共产党坚决领导泰国人民，走农村包围城市、武装夺取政权的道路，是夺取泰国革命胜利的唯一正确的道路。
    文章说，在泰国共产党正确领导下的泰国人民武装，正迅速发展壮大，一次又一次地粉碎了美国—他侬集团的反革命“围剿”，并且日益频繁、主动地歼灭敌人的有生力量，给美泰反动派以沉重的打击。
    文章指出，他侬—巴博卖国集团在美帝国主义的指使下，加紧用武力镇压人民武装，妄图扑灭人民武装斗争烈火。但是，它们的武力镇压一次又一次地被人民武装粉碎了。泰国人民武装不但没有被消灭，而且在反击敌人“围剿”的斗争中迅速发展壮大起来。这充分显示了人民武装具有不可战胜的强大威力，并且暴露了美国—他侬集团的纸老虎本质。
    文章说，美国—他侬集团妄图通过玩弄政治欺骗，颁布伪宪法，准备举行伪选举来转移泰国人民的革命斗争方向，诱骗泰国人民放弃武装斗争。但是，泰国人民坚决进行武装斗争，挫败了敌人的阴谋。在人民武装斗争的沉重打击下，他侬—巴博卖国集团的统治地位越来越不稳固了。
    文章强调指出，泰国人民革命武装斗争，有泰国共产党的正确领导，是以马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想为指导的，是爱国的正义的斗争，获得了泰国广大人民群众的支持。因此，不管要经历怎样艰难、曲折的斗争，最后胜利一定属于泰国人民。
