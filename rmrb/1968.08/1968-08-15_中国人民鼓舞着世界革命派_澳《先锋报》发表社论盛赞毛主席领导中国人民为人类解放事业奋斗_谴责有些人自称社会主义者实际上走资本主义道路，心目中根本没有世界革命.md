The Chinese people inspire the world's revolutionary forces
The Australian newspaper *Vanguard* publishes an editorial praising Chairman Mao's leadership of the Chinese people in the struggle for human liberation
Condemning those who claim to be socialists but actually follow the capitalist road, with no thought of world revolution

	New China News Agency, August 14th - Melbourne: The Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) organ *Vanguard* recently published an editorial praising the struggle of the Chinese people, which has inspired the world's revolutionary people.

	The editorial, titled "The Chinese People Inspire the World's Revolutionary Forces," states that in this era of the final defeat of imperialism, the fundamental issue is to oppose imperialism and strengthen the struggle of the world revolutionary movement. Revolutionary people around the world should engage in joint struggle and support each other as much as possible.

	The editorial quotes Chairman Mao's words: "People who have already won revolutionary victories should aid the struggles of those still fighting for liberation. This is our internationalist duty." The editorial says that in this era, socialist countries should aid revolutionary peoples who have not yet defeated their oppressors. Our common goal is the liberation of humanity and the realization of socialism worldwide.

	The editorial emphasizes that the Chinese people are building socialism not for a life of luxury. Pursuing a life of luxury, idleness, and laziness is a revisionist viewpoint. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese people resolutely oppose this viewpoint, which leads to the restoration of capitalism, privileges, and exploitation.

	The editorial exposes that some people claim to be socialists but are actually following the capitalist road. Their "reforms" ultimately boil down to one thing—material incentives. They have no thought of world revolution in their minds.

	The editorial concludes by pointing out that a true revolutionary must care for his own people, but must view this issue based on the needs of the world revolution. The struggle for socialism has not yet been completely victorious. We must be ready at any time to strike back at the enemy. We must prioritize politics over money. This is what the great Chinese people are doing. Under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, their struggle is inspiring the peoples of all countries in the world.

　　中国人民鼓舞着世界革命派
　　澳《先锋报》发表社论盛赞毛主席领导中国人民为人类解放事业奋斗
    谴责有些人自称社会主义者实际上走资本主义道路，心目中根本没有世界革命
    新华社十四日讯　墨尔本消息：澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义）机关报《先锋报》最近发表社论，赞扬中国人民的斗争鼓舞了世界革命人民。
    这篇题为《中国人民鼓舞着世界革命派》的社论说，在帝国主义最后失败的这个时代，根本的问题当然是反对帝国主义，加强世界革命运动的斗争。全世界革命人民应该进行共同斗争，应该尽量相互支持。
    社论引用了毛主席的语录：“已经获得革命胜利的人民，应该援助正在争取解放的人民的斗争，这是我们的国际主义的义务。”社论说，在这个时代，社会主义国家应当援助尚未打败压迫者的革命人民。我们的共同目的是人类的解放，世界实现社会主义。
    社论强调指出，中国人民建设社会主义，不是为了过奢侈生活。追求奢侈的生活，游手好闲，好吃懒做是修正主义的观点。中国人民在毛主席领导下坚决反对这个导致复辟资本主义、特权和剥削的观点。
    社论揭露说，有些人拍着胸脯宣称，他们是社会主义者。实际上他们是走资本主义道路的人。他们的“改革”最终都归结到一点——物质刺激。他们心目中根本没有世界革命。
    社论最后指出，一个真正的革命者，他必须关心自己的人民，但是必须根据世界革命的需要来看待这个问题。为争取社会主义而进行的斗争还没有完全取得胜利。我们必须随时准备打击来犯的敌人。必须政治挂帅，而不是钞票挂帅。这便是伟大的中国人民正在做的事。他们在伟大的领袖毛主席领导下所进行的斗争，正在鼓舞着世界各国人民。
