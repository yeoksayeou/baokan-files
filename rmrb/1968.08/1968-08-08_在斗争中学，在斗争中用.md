Under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's "Bombard the Headquarters" big-character poster and a series of his latest instructions, and under the command of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, we have already achieved decisive victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Through two years of struggle, we have come to a deeper understanding that the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin best represents the fundamental interests of the working class and the broad revolutionary masses. The working class loves the proletarian headquarters more, is more loyal to it, and more firmly follows it.

Currently, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution nationwide has entered a crucial moment of achieving comprehensive victory. The closer we get to victory, the more fiercely the class enemies struggle in their death throes. A handful of class enemies keep stirring up winds of attack against the proletarian headquarters from the sewers, and some bourgeois careerists and sectarianists are manufacturing "multi-centerism" to create reactionary public opinion in an attempt to realize their counter-revolutionary coup. The working class must keep our eyes open and resolutely strike back against these class enemies who attempt to undermine the proletarian headquarters and against these reactionary trends. Only in this way can we consolidate our proletarian revolutionary power and defend the sole leadership center of the entire Party, the entire army, and the entire nation—the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin.

In the past two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the working class has deeply understood that Chairman Mao most supports us and trusts us. We also love Chairman Mao more and more firmly follow every great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, resolutely and unconditionally executing every latest instruction issued by Chairman Mao. Our struggle practice has proven that as long as we follow Chairman Mao and resolutely execute the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, we will be invincible. Once we deviate from Mao Zedong Thought and the orders of the proletarian headquarters, we will be at a loss, achieve nothing, and even fall into the capitalist mire. Therefore, to defend the proletarian headquarters, we must study and apply Mao Zedong Thought actively, learn in struggle, and apply in struggle, especially to study and apply Chairman Mao's series of extremely important latest instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

In studying Mao Zedong Thought, we must carry forward the revolutionary academic style advocated by Chairman Mao, which emphasizes the integration of theory and practice, and demonstrate our boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line through application. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Regarding Marxist theory, one must master it and apply it; the purpose of mastery is entirely for application." Loyalty to Chairman Mao means using Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, using Mao Zedong Thought to transform one's worldview, and in struggle, implementing Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions concretely and fully, and putting them into every action. Regarding Chairman Mao's instructions and the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters, merely studying without applying, talking without doing, is being a fake revolutionary. We proletarian revolutionaries learn to apply. The working class must, with our actual actions, resolutely defend the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao.

　　在斗争中学，在斗争中用
　　上海市活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子上海工人革命造反总司令部领导成员  王秀珍
    在伟大领袖毛主席《炮打司令部》的大字报和一系列最新指示的指引下，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的统帅下，我们已经夺得了无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利。经过两年来的斗争实践，我们更加深刻地体会到，以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，最能代表我们工人阶级和广大革命人民群众的根本利益。我们工人阶级更加热爱无产阶级司令部，更加忠于无产阶级司令部，更加坚定地紧跟无产阶级司令部。
    当前，全国无产阶级文化大革命已进入夺取全面胜利的关键时刻。我们越是接近胜利，阶级敌人也越是垂死挣扎。一小撮阶级敌人不断从阴沟洞里刮起攻击无产阶级司令部的阴风，还有一些资产阶级个人野心家、山头主义者，制造什么“多中心论”，妄图为实现他们的反革命夺权阴谋制造反动舆论。我们工人阶级对于这些妄图动摇无产阶级司令部的阶级敌人，对于这些反动思潮，必须擦亮眼睛，坚决回击。只有这样，才能巩固我们的无产阶级革命政权，才能捍卫全党、全军、全国唯一的领导中心——以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部。
    我们工人阶级在两年来的无产阶级文化大革命斗争中，深深懂得，毛主席最支持我们，最信任我们。我们也更加热爱毛主席，更加坚定不移地紧跟毛主席的每一个伟大战略部署，坚决地不折不扣地执行毛主席发出的每一个最新指示。我们的斗争实践证明，只要紧跟毛主席，坚决执行以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的战斗号令，就无往而不胜。一旦离开了毛泽东思想，背离了无产阶级司令部的号令，就寸步难行，一事无成，甚至滚到资产阶级的泥坑里去。因此，我们要捍卫无产阶级司令部，就必须活学活用毛泽东思想，在斗争中学，在斗争中用，特别是要学好用好毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的一系列极其重要的最新指示。
    学习毛泽东思想，一定要发扬毛主席倡导的理论联系实际的革命学风，要通过用来体现对毛主席、对毛泽东思想、对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的无限忠诚。毛主席教导我们：“对于马克思主义的理论，要能够精通它、应用它，精通的目的全在于应用。”忠于毛主席，就是要用毛泽东思想统帅一切，用毛泽东思想改造自己的世界观，在斗争中把毛主席的一系列最新指示切切实实地贯彻下去，落实在每一个行动上。对于毛主席的指示，对于无产阶级司令部的战斗号令，光学不用，光说不做，那就是口头革命派，是假革命派。我们无产阶级革命派，就是学了就用，学是为了用。我们工人阶级一定要用自己的实际行动，坚决捍卫以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部。
