Bucharest, August 23 - A military parade and mass rally were held in Bucharest, the capital of Romania, to celebrate the country's national day.

Units from Romania's armed forces, including various branches and units, participated in the parade. Additionally, there were 5,000 members of patriotic militia units composed of workers, peasants, and intellectuals. This militia was formed on August 21 following the Soviet revisionist clique's sudden and brutal invasion of Czechoslovakia with a large number of armed forces on August 20. The patriotic militia units received a warm welcome from the crowd.

Following the parade, a grand mass rally was held. The masses demanded an immediate halt to the armed aggression and intervention in Czechoslovakia and expressed strong support for the Czech and Slovak people. The rally participants also vowed to defend Romania's national independence. They repeatedly chanted, "Defend the motherland resolutely!"

Romanian leaders Nicolae Ceaușescu and Gheorghe Maurer attended the review ceremony.
