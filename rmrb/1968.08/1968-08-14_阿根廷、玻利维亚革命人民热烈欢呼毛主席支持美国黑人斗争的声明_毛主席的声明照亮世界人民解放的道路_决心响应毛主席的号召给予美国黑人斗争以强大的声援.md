	Argentinian and Bolivian revolutionary people warmly welcome Chairman Mao's statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence.

	Chairman Mao's statement illuminates the path to liberation for the peoples of the world.

	We are determined to respond to Chairman Mao's call and give strong support to the struggle of American blacks.

	Xinhua News Agency, August 13th: The revolutionary people of Argentina and Bolivia warmly welcome Chairman Mao's statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence.

	A young Argentinian electrician said, "Chairman Mao's statement makes us understand that acting according to the principles of non-violence cannot defeat revolutionary violence. This young worker said, 'Chairman Mao's statement on April 16th this year and the one on August 8th, 1963, have pointed out a great strategic line for American blacks: to unite with the American working class, to unite with the oppressed peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and to oppose American imperialism.' He said, 'After reading the statement of 1963, I began to understand the cause and significance of the black struggle. After reading the statement of April 16th this year, my understanding deepened, and I gained an optimistic spirit, with greater confidence in the victory of the world revolution.'"

	An Argentinian steelworker said: "Chairman Mao's statement makes us realize that the struggle of the black masses is the same as the struggle of all American people, aiming at the same enemy. This struggle is a struggle of the oppressed blacks and whites against the oppressors."

	He said: "The struggle of American blacks and our struggle is a common cause. The struggle of American blacks has greatly helped us, and we should also help them more than we do now, to give American imperialism a heavier blow."

	This steelworker also emphasized that the central issue of the revolutionary struggle is the issue of power. He said: "No matter where, the central issue is the issue of power; 'to fundamentally solve this problem, the only way is to seize power from the imperialists.'"

	An Argentinian student said: Chairman Mao, in his statement, reiterated his famous thesis: "National struggle, in the final analysis, is a class struggle." This student pointed out that, starting from this correct class analysis, Chairman Mao's statement pointed out the correct path for the struggle, and the oppressed and exploited American blacks should unite with the broad laboring masses of the United States and the revolutionary forces of the world to oppose the American monopolistic bourgeoisie. The proletariat of imperialist countries should help the oppressed peoples and nations, and unite to oppose the common enemy.

	An Argentinian progressive lawyer said that Chairman Mao's statement fully reflects "Chairman Mao's great trust in the oppressed masses of the world and his great confidence in the victory of the world revolution."

	This lawyer said, "We should overthrow the imperialist system and strive for complete liberation."

	A Bolivian writer said, "Chairman Mao's statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence 'illuminates the path to national liberation for the peoples of Latin America and the world.' He expressed: The revolutionary intellectuals of Bolivia will firmly fight against American imperialism and its lackeys."

	A student leader from Bolivia expressed complete support for Chairman Mao's wise thesis: "The evil system of colonialism and imperialism, which has prospered with the enslavement and trafficking of blacks, will also come to an end with the complete liberation of the black race."

	This student leader pointed out that the recent suppression of blacks by American imperialism, its crimes against the Vietnamese people, and its series of colonialist aggressive activities in Latin America are promoting the broad masses of the people to fight against this blood-sucking American imperialist. He expressed, "We will respond to Chairman Mao's call and give strong support to the struggle of American blacks."

　　阿根廷、玻利维亚革命人民热烈欢呼毛主席支持美国黑人斗争的声明
　　毛主席的声明照亮世界人民解放的道路
　　决心响应毛主席的号召给予美国黑人斗争以强大的声援
    新华社十三日讯　阿根廷和玻利维亚革命人民热烈欢呼毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明。
    一位阿根廷青年电工说，毛主席的声明使我们懂得，按照非暴力主义的主张去行动是无法击败反革命暴力的。这位青年工人说，毛主席在今年四月十六日发表的声明和一九六三年八月八日发表的声明“给美国黑人指出了一个伟大的战略方针：同美国工人阶级联合起来，同亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国被压迫人民联合起来，反对美帝国主义。”他说：“我在读了一九六三年的声明后，开始懂得黑人斗争的原因和重要意义。读了今年四月十六日发表的声明后，更加深了我的理解，使我有了乐观主义精神，对世界革命的胜利有了更大的信心。”
      一位阿根廷钢铁工人说：毛主席的声明使我们认识到，黑人群众的斗争同全体美国人民的斗争都是指向共同的敌人。这个斗争是被剥削的黑人和白人反对剥削者的斗争。
    他说：美国黑人的斗争和我们的斗争是共同的事业，美国黑人的斗争大大帮助了我们，我们也应该比现在更多地援助他们，给予美帝国主义以更加沉重的打击。
    这位钢铁工人还强调革命斗争的中心问题是政权问题。他说：
  “不论在什么地方，中心问题都是一个政权问题”；“要根本解决这个问题，唯一的办法，就是从帝国主义者的手里夺取政权。”
      一位阿根廷大学生说：毛主席在声明中又阐明了他的著名论断：
  “民族斗争，说到底，是一个阶级斗争问题。”这位大学生指出，毛主席的声明从这一正确的阶级分析出发，指出了斗争应该走的正确道路，被剥削、被压迫的美国黑人同美国广大劳动人民群众以及全世界革命力量应该联合起来，反对美国垄断资产阶级，帝国主义国家的无产阶级同被压迫人民、被压迫民族应该互相帮助，联合起来反对共同敌人。
    一位阿根廷进步律师说，毛主席的声明充分反映出“毛主席对全世界被剥削群众的巨大信任和对世界革命胜利的巨大信心”。
    这位律师说，我们应该摧毁帝国主义制度，争取彻底的解放。
    一位玻利维亚作家说，毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明“照亮了我们拉丁美洲各国人民和世界各国人民的民族解放的道路。”他表示：玻利维亚的革命知识分子要同美帝国主义及其仆从展开坚定不移的斗争。
    玻利维亚的一位学生领导人表示完全拥护毛主席的英明论断：“万恶的殖民主义、帝国主义制度是随着奴役和贩卖黑人而兴盛起来的，它也必将随着黑色人种的彻底解放而告终。”
    这位学生领导人指出，美帝国主义最近对黑人的镇压，它对越南人民犯下的罪行以及对拉丁美洲所进行的一系列殖民主义的侵略活动，正在促进广大人民对美国这个压迫成性的吸血鬼展开斗争。他表示，“我们要响应毛主席的号召，给予美国黑人的斗争以强大的声援。”
