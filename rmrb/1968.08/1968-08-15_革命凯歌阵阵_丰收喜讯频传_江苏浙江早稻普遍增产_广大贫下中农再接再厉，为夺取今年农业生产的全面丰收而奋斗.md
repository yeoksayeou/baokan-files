In the face of the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Jiangsu Province, after achieving a bumper harvest of summer crops, has again secured a general increase in early rice production. At present, nearly three million mu of early rice in the province have generally turned yellow and ripe, and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and community members are busy harvesting with sickles.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in Jiangsu, with a heart full of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, firmly grasp the use of Mao Zedong Thought, continuously promoting the revolutionization of thought. They resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production." During the busy season, they closely combine current tasks, conduct revolutionary criticism in the fields, courtyards, and riverbanks, and eliminate the poison of the revisionist black goods spread by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, such as the "three freedoms and one contract," "four freedoms," "work points in command," and "class struggle extinguished" theories. This has greatly raised the awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, greatly mobilized the enthusiasm for revolutionary farming, and ensured the bumper harvest of early rice.

In the struggle to achieve a bumper harvest of early rice, revolutionary committees at all levels in the province and the stationed People's Liberation Army have sent Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to the countryside, focusing on revolution and vigorously promoting production. Members of revolutionary committees at all levels and soldiers of the PLA have helped community members and cadres to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, labor, study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and engage in class struggle and criticism of the Chinese Khrushchev together, which has been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants.

In the midst of the victory songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the news of a bumper harvest of early rice has come from the coastal areas of Zhejiang Province. The main grain-producing areas of Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Lake Tai in the province have seen a significant increase in early rice production compared to the bumper harvest year of 1967. At present, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants are harvesting while rushing to sow, striving for further victories, and fighting for a comprehensive bumper harvest in agricultural production this year.

This year's bumper harvest of early rice in Zhejiang was achieved after overcoming severe droughts and low temperatures. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the province have firmly implemented Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production," held various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and extensively studied and applied the "Old Three Articles" and Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. They used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to overcome all difficulties. During the early rice sowing and seedling raising period this year, drought and water shortage were widespread in rural areas across the province. In coastal and mountainous areas, some places experienced drought for seven to eight months. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, remembering Chairman Mao's teaching of "firmly resolve, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," displayed a brave fighting spirit, day and night, cutting mountains to open canals, building dams to block rivers, and carrying water to fight drought, overcoming the disasters.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the province also followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forget class struggle," using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, actively launching a fierce attack on a handful of class enemies, and severely striking down the sabotage activities of a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. With deep hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev, they set up revolutionary criticism battlefields everywhere in villages, families, fields, and roadsides, fiercely exposing and criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist black goods such as the "class struggle extinguished" theory, "three freedoms and one contract," "four freedoms," "material incentives," and the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Zhejiang's countryside, such as slashing cooperatives and spreading the evil wind of capitalist restoration. Through in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism, the awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines among the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres has been greatly raised. They have invested the surging enthusiasm released in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution into the production struggle of changing heaven and earth, achieving a bumper harvest in agriculture.

During the growth process of early rice, revolutionary cadres and community members in Zhejiang's countryside have resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "learn from Dazhai in agriculture," launching a magnificent wave of learning from Dazhai across the province. Many places in the province have held Mao Zedong Thought study classes with learning from Dazhai as the main content, and some have held on-site meetings or experience-sharing meetings, making the Dazhai experience widely promoted.

Members of revolutionary committees at all levels in Zhejiang Province have also gone to the front lines, leading community members to focus on revolution and vigorously promote production, using revolution to drive production. Since the beginning of summer harvest and summer sowing, a propaganda team of nearly five thousand people organized by the provincial revolutionary committee has been sent to rural areas across the province. Wherever the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team goes, they spread Chairman Mao's latest instructions there. They eat, live, and work with the poor and lower-middle peasants, promoting the continuous development of revolution and production.

　　革命凯歌阵阵　丰收喜讯频传
　　江苏浙江早稻普遍增产
　　广大贫下中农再接再厉，为夺取今年农业生产的全面丰收而奋斗
    新华社南京电　在无产阶级文化大革命节节胜利的大好形势下，江苏省继夺得夏熟作物丰收后，又夺得了早稻的普遍增产。目前，全省近三百万亩早稻已普遍黄熟，广大贫下中农和社员群众正在挥镰收割。
    江苏广大贫下中农和革命干部，对伟大领袖毛主席心怀一个“忠”字，对伟大的毛泽东思想狠抓一个“用”字，不断地促进了思想革命化。他们坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，在大忙季节，紧密结合当前任务，在田头、场头、河边开展革命大批判，肃清中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人所散布的“三自一包”、“四大自由”、“工分挂帅”、“阶级斗争熄灭”论等修正主义黑货的流毒，有力地提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟，极大地调动了为革命种田的积极性，保证了早稻的丰收。
    在夺取早稻丰收的战斗中，全省各级革命委员会和驻地人民解放军，都派出毛泽东思想宣传队，深入农村，狠抓革命，猛促生产。各级革委会成员和解放军指战员，帮助社员群众和干部大办毛泽东思想学习班，同贫下中农一起劳动，一起学习毛主席最新指示，一起搞阶级斗争，一起批判中国赫鲁晓夫，受到了广大贫下中农的热烈赞扬和欢迎。
    新华社杭州十三日电　在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，从东海之滨的浙江农村传来了早稻丰收的喜讯。全省主要粮食产区杭嘉湖平原的早稻比丰收的一九六七年有较大幅度的增产。目前，广大贫下中农正在边收割、边抢种，再接再厉，为夺取今年农业生产的全面丰收而奋斗。
    浙江今年早稻的丰收，是在战胜严重干旱、低温等自然灾害以后夺得的。全省广大贫下中农和革命干部，坚决贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，大学大用“老三篇”和毛主席一系列最新指示，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想去战胜一切困难。今年早稻播种育秧期间，全省各地农村普遍干旱缺水，沿海和山区有的地方干旱时间长达七、八个月。广大贫下中农和革命干部牢记毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，发扬勇敢战斗的革命精神，日日夜夜劈山开渠，拦河筑坝，挑水抗旱，战胜了灾害。
    全省广大贫下中农和革命干部，还遵循毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，主动地向一小撮阶级敌人发动了猛烈进攻，狠狠打击了党内一小撮走资派和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子的破坏活动。他们怀着对中国赫鲁晓夫的深仇大恨，在村头、家庭、田头、地边，到处摆开了革命大批判的战场，狠揭猛批中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论、“三自一包”、“四大自由”、“物质刺激”等反革命修正主义黑货以及中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在浙江农村大砍合作社，大刮资本主义复辟妖风的滔天罪行。通过深入持久的革命大批判，大大提高了广大贫下中农和革命干部阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟，他们把在无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的冲天干劲，投入到改天换地的生产斗争中去，夺得了农业丰收。
    在早稻生长过程中，浙江农村广大革命干部和社员，坚决响应毛主席“农业学大寨”的伟大号召，在全省掀起了轰轰烈烈的农业学大寨的热潮。全省许多地方层层举办了以学大寨为主要内容的毛泽东思想学习班，有的还召开了现场会议或经验交流会，使大寨经验得到广泛推广。
    浙江省各级革命委员会成员还深入第一线，领导社员狠抓革命，猛促生产，以革命推动生产。今年夏收夏种开始后，一支由省革委会组织的近五千人的毛泽东思想宣传队分赴各地农村。毛泽东思想宣传队走到那里，就把毛主席的最新指示宣传到那里。他们和贫下中农同吃、同住、同劳动，推动了革命和生产的不断发展。
