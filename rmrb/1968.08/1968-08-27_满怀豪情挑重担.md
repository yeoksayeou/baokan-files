A thunderous roar shakes the heavens, illuminating Chairman Mao's latest directive. Mountains and rivers rejoice, and the battle cry echoes across the land. Every word of the great teachings is etched in our hearts, and tears of joy stream down our faces. Flipping through the pages of history, who has ever treated the working class as human beings? Of all our kin, who is the closest to us? Chairman Mao has the utmost trust in the working class! A series of new directives shine brightly, showing Chairman Mao's deep love for the working class! Chairman Mao has entrusted us with a glorious mission, and we, with great zeal, carry it on our shoulders. We will break the thousand-year-old rules and bad habits, and the working class will take charge of education! With our hands, accustomed to wielding hammers and pliers, we will build this revolutionary furnace of a school! We will plant the roots of the thousand-year-old tree firmly, nurturing the successors of the revolutionary cause. We will lead the struggle, criticism, and reform of the superstructure, sending the bourgeois education system to the guillotine! We vow to drive away the filthy air in the schools, and we workers will dare to change the heavens and the earth! Unless we firmly occupy the ideological battlefield, our hearts will never find peace. Unless we uproot the roots of revisionism, the working class will never rest! In the struggle for the ideological realm, we must take the lead, it is our duty. Looking ahead: boundless beauty awaits at the peak, Chairman Mao waves his hand, urging us to strive to climb! Though the pass is like iron, we must work hard to transform the old world! We fear not the attacks of the bourgeois old forces, for we are invincible with Mao Zedong Thought in our grasp. Chairman Mao has personally drawn the blueprint, and we, clearing the way and striding forward! The working class is determined to liberate all of humanity, and we will not turn back until our goal is achieved! We will open a new chapter in the history of education, hailing Mao Zedong Thought's sunshine for ten thousand years!
