The glorious People's Liberation Army of China is the great leader Chairman Mao's personally created and led, and Vice Chairman Lin Biao's directly commanded people's army. It is an invincible heroic army armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and the great wall of our socialist motherland. The People's Liberation Army has not only established great military achievements for the liberation of the Chinese people with the lives and blood of countless revolutionary martyrs, but also in this unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution, it has striven to fulfill the historical mission of "three supports, two militaries" entrusted by the great leader Chairman Mao, and established new merits for the people. Seven hundred million Chinese people sincerely love the People's Liberation Army and give it the highest praise. Revolutionary people all over the world also enthusiastically praise this new type of proletarian revolutionary army.

However, the revisionist traitor clique led by Brezhnev and Kosygin is terrified and hates the great People's Liberation Army of China to death. They operate their propaganda machines to maliciously slander the People's Liberation Army's "three supports, two militaries" work as "the soldiers' bayonets continuing to attack," attempting to use this to defame China's proletarian cultural revolution and the great People's Liberation Army, to intimidate and deceive the Soviet people and the people of the world, to resist the unstoppable influence of this proletarian cultural revolution that shakes the world, and to maintain the shaky reactionary rule of the revisionist traitors.

The great revolutionary teacher Lenin pointed out: "Political abuse often conceals the abuser's lack of principles, helplessness, weakness, and annoying weakness." The revisionist traitor clique's endless cursing of the great People's Liberation Army of China is precisely a manifestation of their helplessness and weakness.

The great People's Liberation Army of China is the strong pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the loyal defender of the proletarian cultural revolution. The unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution carried out on Chinese soil has frightened the imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries to the point of losing their souls. They curse the "prospects of the cultural revolution are bleak" like witches, eagerly hoping for some "turmoil and unrest," dreaming of the "collapse" of the Chinese proletarian regime. Unfortunately, the People's Liberation Army stands firm like an iron wall, unshakable, with high revolutionary vigilance, seizing the revolution and promoting preparedness, not giving any opportunity to the imperialists, revisionists, and domestic class enemies. How can this not make the Soviet masters furious?

Even more important is that the great People's Liberation Army of China, following the wise instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao that "the People's Liberation Army should support the broad masses of the left," in the "three supports, two militaries" work, has held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely followed the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, firmly stood on the side of the revolutionary left, used Mao Zedong Thought to support the broad masses of the left, and together with the revolutionary masses, defeated the headquarters of the bourgeoisie led by the Chinese Khrushchev, thoroughly smashed their plot to restore capitalism, defended the new revolutionary regime, and directly participated in the revolutionary committees of the three-in-one combination. This proclaimed the complete failure of the imperialists and modern revisionists' plot to carry out "peaceful evolution" in China, and swept away the ghosts and monsters they had placed their unlimited hopes in, as well as the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries. The death of the rabbit makes the fox sad, and the injury of one makes the other feel the pain. How can this not make the Soviet masters sad?

Through the test of the proletarian cultural revolution and the "three supports, two militaries" work, in the fierce struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, the awareness of class struggle and the awareness of the struggle between the two lines of all officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army have been greatly enhanced. Therefore, this people's army will be even more loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, even more loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and even more loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, becoming a great army that is even more proletarian and even more combat-ready. This will enable our socialist motherland to withstand any storm, make our proletarian dictatorship even more solid, ensure that our country remains unchanged for generations, and guarantee that we have a stronger force to support the world revolution. How can this not make the Soviet masters feel terrified and go into a hysterical fit?

It is precisely because of this that the revisionist traitor clique particularly hates the "soldiers" armed with Mao Zedong Thought and the "bayonets" firmly grasped by the proletariat. It is not strange that the revisionist traitor clique viciously attacks the People's Liberation Army of China. Chairman Mao teaches us, "Being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing." If the revisionists sing praises to us, then our army would no longer be the children of the Chinese people!

The masters of the revisionist traitor clique, your clumsy tricks cannot deceive the broad Soviet people or the revolutionary people of the world. You keep cursing about the "soldiers' bayonets continuing to attack," right? Let me tell you honestly: the "soldiers" of the great People's Liberation Army of China, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will firmly grasp the revolutionary "bayonets" of the proletariat, under the command of the great leader Chairman Mao, and mercilessly "attack" all domestic and foreign class enemies who dare to invade. If imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of various countries dare to invade our great motherland, we will annihilate them completely!

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The military, police, courts, and other state machinery are tools for one class to oppress another. For the opposing class, it is a tool of oppression, it is violence, and not something 'kind.' For the handful of capitalist roaders within the party and the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes they represent, the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and all kinds of traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionary revisionists, we must implement dictatorship over them and not allow them to cause trouble. If they dare to cause trouble, we must suppress them. The duty of our People's Liberation Army is to hold onto the rifle, to defend the dictatorship of the proletariat!"

Chairman Mao recently teaches us: "For the broad masses of the people, is it protection or suppression? This is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between the dictatorship of the proletariat and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie." For the people, every officer and soldier of the People's Liberation Army loves them dearly. The army and the broad revolutionary masses of the people are flesh and blood, fish and water. This is the fundamental difference between it and all bourgeois and revisionist armies. In this unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution, the heroes who emerged in the storm—Li Wenzhong, Cai Yongxiang, Menhe—are the shining representatives of this people's army.

Let those revisionist clowns cry in the dark corners! The great People's Liberation Army of China was born in the storm of class struggle and will be tempered even stronger in the waves of the world revolution! The buzzing of a handful of traitors and scabs will not harm a single hair of the glorious People's Liberation Army of China. The great wall will forever stand in the east of the world!

　　伟大的长城不可侮！
　　北京部队装甲兵战士　孔令铜
    光荣的中国人民解放军，是我们伟大领袖毛主席亲手缔造、亲自领导，林彪副主席直接指挥的人民军队，是一支用毛泽东思想武装起来的举世无双的英雄军队，是我们社会主义祖国的伟大的长城。中国人民解放军不仅用无数革命先烈的生命和鲜血，为中国人民的解放事业立下了伟大的战功，而且在这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，努力完成伟大领袖毛主席赋予的“三支”“两军”的历史使命，为人民建立了新的功勋。七亿中国人民衷心热爱人民解放军，给人民解放军以崇高的赞誉。全世界的革命人民也无不热烈赞扬这支新型的无产阶级革命军队。
    可是，以勃列日涅夫、柯西金为首的苏修叛徒集团，却对伟大的中国人民解放军怕得要死，恨得要命。他们开动宣传机器，恶毒地诬蔑中国人民解放军的“三支”“两军”工作是什么“士兵的刺刀继续进行讨伐”，企图以此诋毁中国的无产阶级文化大革命和伟大的中国人民解放军，来恫吓和蒙骗苏联人民和世界人民，抵制这场震撼世界的无产阶级文化大革命不可遏止的影响，保住苏修叛徒摇摇欲坠的反动统治。
    伟大的革命导师列宁指出：“政治上的谩骂往往掩盖着谩骂者的毫无思想原则、束手无策、软弱无力、恼人的软弱无力。”苏修叛徒集团百般咒骂伟大的中国人民解放军，就正是一种束手无策、软弱无力的表现。
    伟大的中国人民解放军，是无产阶级专政的坚强柱石，是无产阶级文化大革命的忠实捍卫者。在中国土地上开展的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，吓得帝修反魂不附体。他们象巫婆一样地诅咒“文化大革命前景暗淡”，心急情迫地盼望着什么“动荡和骚乱”，梦想着中国无产阶级政权的“垮台”。怎奈中国人民解放军有如钢铁长城，岿然不动，以高度的革命警惕，抓革命，促战备，不给帝修反和国内阶级敌人以任何可乘之隙。这怎么能不使苏修老爷们恼怒呢？
    特别重要的是，伟大的中国人民解放军，遵照伟大领袖毛主席“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的英明指示，在“三支”“两军”工作中，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚定地站在革命左派一边，用毛泽东思想支持左派广大群众，同广大革命群众一起，把以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部打得落花流水，彻底粉碎他们复辟资本主义的阴谋，捍卫了新生的革命政权，并直接参加了三结合的革命委员会。这就宣告了帝国主义和现代修正主义企图在中国搞“和平演变”阴谋的彻底破产，扫除了他们寄托着无限希望的牛鬼蛇神以及国民党反动派的残渣余孽。兔死狐悲，物伤其类。这怎么能不叫苏修老爷们悲伤呢？
    通过无产阶级文化大革命的考验，通过“三支”“两军”工作，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈搏斗中，中国人民解放军的全体指战员极大地提高了阶级斗争觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟。因此，这支人民军队将更加忠于伟大领袖毛主席，更加忠于毛泽东思想，更加忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，成为一支更加无产阶级化、更加战斗化的伟大军队。这就使我们的社会主义祖国能够经受任何惊涛骇浪的考验，使我们的无产阶级专政更加巩固，就可以保证我们的国家千秋万代永不变色，保证我们有更强大的力量来支援世界革命。这又怎么能不使苏修老爷们感到惊恐，从而歇斯底里大发作呢？
    正是因为这样，苏修叛徒集团格外痛恨用毛泽东思想武装起来的“士兵”和紧紧地掌握在无产阶级手中的“刺刀”。苏修叛徒集团恶毒攻击中国人民解放军，这并不是什么怪事。毛主席教导我们，“被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事”。如果苏修对我们唱起赞歌来，那我们的军队也就不成其为中国人民的子弟兵了！
    苏修叛徒集团的老爷们，你们那一套拙劣伎俩是欺骗不了广大苏联人民，欺骗不了全世界革命人民的。你们不是大骂什么“士兵的刺刀继续进行讨伐”吗？老实告诉你们：用毛泽东思想武装起来的伟大的中国人民解放军的“士兵”，就是要紧紧地掌握无产阶级革命的“刺刀”，在伟大领袖毛主席的号令下，对于胆敢来犯的国内外一切阶级敌人，毫不留情地进行“讨伐”。帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派胆敢侵犯我们伟大的祖国，我们就要把他们消灭干净！
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“军队、警察、法庭等项国家机器，是阶级压迫阶级的工具。对于敌对的阶级，它是压迫的工具，它是暴力，并不是什么‘仁慈’的东西。”对于党内最大的一小撮走资派和他们所代表的资产阶级和一切剥削阶级，国民党的残渣余孽以及形形色色的叛徒、特务和反革命修正主义分子，就是要对他们实行专政，不许他们乱说乱动。他们要是胆敢捣乱，就要对他们实行镇压。我们人民解放军的职责就是握紧枪杆子，保卫无产阶级专政！
    毛主席最近教导我们：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”对于人民，中国人民解放军的每一个指战员都是无比热爱。解放军和广大革命人民群众血肉相连、鱼水相亲。这是它同一切资产阶级、修正主义的军队的根本区别。在这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命的风浪中涌现的英雄——李文忠、蔡永祥、门合，就是这支人民军队的光辉代表。
    让那些修正主义小丑们躲在阴暗的角落里哀鸣去吧！伟大的中国人民解放军是在阶级斗争的暴风雨中诞生的，也必将在世界革命的风浪中锻炼得更加坚强！一小撮工贼和叛徒的嗡嗡叫，丝毫无损于光荣的中国人民解放军的一根毫毛，伟大的长城将永远屹立在世界的东方！
