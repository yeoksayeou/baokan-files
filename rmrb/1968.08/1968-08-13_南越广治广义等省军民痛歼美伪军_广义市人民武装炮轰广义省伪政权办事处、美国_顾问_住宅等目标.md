On August 6, the people's liberation armed forces simultaneously shelled the enemy who had just arrived near Duc Lam and east of A Chau to conduct "sweeping operations," annihilating more than 110 enemy troops.

On August 3, 4, and 7, the people's liberation armed forces attacked the enemy bases at Vung Tau, Dong Ha, and the enemy artillery positions at Kon Tum, inflicting significant losses on the enemy.

The people's liberation armed forces in Quang Ngai Province launched attacks on 20 enemy military and political institutions and strongholds in Quang Ngai City and the districts of Son Tinh and Mo Duc from July 22 to 23, killing and wounding nearly 500 enemy troops.

In Quang Ngai City, the people's liberation armed forces shelled the Quang Ngai Provincial puppet government office, the U.S. "advisors'" residence, the radio station, the airport, the puppet army's 4th Regiment headquarters, and the puppet police outpost, among other targets, on the night of July 22.

They annihilated 190 enemy troops. The next morning, the remaining enemy troops fled in panic but were ambushed and annihilated by the people's liberation armed forces, killing 60 more.

The military and civilians in Tan Phu District, Tien Giang Province, bravely repelled the "sweeping operations" launched by the U.S. aggressors in two directions towards An Thanh Commune on July 23, annihilating more than 100 enemy troops. Undeterred by their failure, the enemy sent large numbers of U.S. troops to counterattack on July 26.
