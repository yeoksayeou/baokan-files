In the midst of the triumphant songs of the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have received the latest instructions from our great leader Chairman Mao and the joyous news of Chairman Mao's reception of the workers' representatives and the PLA soldiers and officers from the capital. This has greatly inspired and spurred on all the Red Guards and revolutionary students who are engaged in the education revolution. Everyone has deeply felt that Chairman Mao's latest instructions have once again pointed out the direction for our ideological revolution.

Not long ago, the Red Guards and revolutionary students from our school went to the factories to work with the workers on the education revolution. Through practical contact, we deeply felt that the working class is the most loyal to Chairman Mao and the most loyal to Mao Zedong Thought. The working class follows Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment the closest and is always the model for intellectuals to learn from.

When we first went to the factory, the workers heard that we were there to carry out the education revolution and they all actively and enthusiastically helped us. Some workers, in order to give us lectures, worked until two or three in the morning. They said, "To firmly grasp the educational power in the hands of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, we can go without food and sleep, and we must work together with you to carry out the education revolution well." The exemplary actions of the working class in earnestly implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, their active study and application of Mao Zedong Thought, and their learning style of combining theory with practice have deeply educated all of us students.

The working class is indeed the leading class of our country. In order to cultivate us into successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause, they constantly help us transform our ideology in our interactions. At the beginning, some students had incorrect ideas about going to the factory. Some thought, "This time we should go to the factory to learn some skills." After discovering this, the workers immediately criticized the revisionist educational line with us. They pointed out sharply, "If one learns skills for personal fame and gain, no matter how much practical experience one has, it cannot serve proletarian politics." The workers' words made these students wake up and corrected their thoughts about going to the factory.

Chairman Mao's latest instructions have once again timely pointed out the direction for the education revolution. The working class is not only the leading class of the Cultural Revolution but also the leading class of the education revolution. Intellectuals must integrate with the workers, peasants, and soldiers to transform their worldview, to sweep away all non-proletarian thoughts, and to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, never falling behind.

We are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely follow the path of integrating with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, carrying the education revolution through to the end!

    向工人阶级学习，走同工农兵结合的道路编辑同志：
    在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，传来了我们伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示和毛主席接见首都工人代表和解放军指战员的特大喜讯，给了我们正在搞教育革命的全体红卫兵和革命师生极大的鼓舞和鞭策。大家深有体会地说，毛主席的最新指示，又一次为我们指出了思想革命化的方向。
    不久以前，我们学校的红卫兵和革命师生，到工厂和工人同志一起搞教育革命。在实际接触中，我们深深地感到工人阶级最忠于毛主席，最忠于毛泽东思想。工人阶级跟毛主席伟大战略部署跟得最紧，永远是知识分子学习的榜样。
    刚下厂时，工人同志们听说我们是来搞教育革命的，都主动地热情地帮助我们搞。有的工人为了给我们讲课，一直工作到晚上两三点钟。他们说：“为了把教育大权牢牢掌握在无产阶级革命派手中，我们可以不吃饭，不睡觉，一定和你们一起把教育革命搞好。”工人阶级认真落实毛主席的最新指示的模范行动，他们活学活用毛泽东思想，理论联系实际的学风，使我们全体师生受到了深刻的教育。
    工人阶级不愧为我们国家的领导阶级。他们为了把我们培养成无产阶级革命事业的接班人，在相处中，时时刻刻帮助我们改造思想。刚开始，同学中对下厂有些不正确的想法。有的想，这回到工厂要好好学点技术。工人同志们发现以后，马上和我们一起批判修正主义教育路线。他们一针见血地指出：“如果为了个人名利学技术，实践经验再多，也不能为无产阶级政治服务。”工人同志的话，使这些同学清醒过来，端正了下厂的思想。
    毛主席的最新指示，又一次及时地给我们指明了教育革命的方向。工人阶级不但是文化大革命的领导阶级，也是教育革命的领导阶级。知识分子必须和工农兵相结合，才能改造世界观，才能肃清各种非无产阶级思想，才能紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，永不掉队。
    我们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚定不移地走同工农兵相结合的道路，把教育革命进行到底！
