Ten million military personnel and civilians gathered to celebrate the tenth anniversary of Chairman Mao's inspection of the Qilicamp People's Commune. They resolved, under the wise leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, to better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, further purge the poison of counter-revolutionary revisionism spread by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, and turn the people's communes into vibrant schools of Mao Zedong Thought.

XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, ZHENGZHOU, August 10 - On August 6, 100,000 poor and lower-middle peasants from the Xinyang region of Henan Province and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed there held a grand rally at the Qilicamp People's Commune to enthusiastically celebrate the tenth anniversary of the great leader Chairman Mao's inspection of the Qilicamp People's Commune.

Ten years ago, when the people's commune, this new thing, just emerged, it received the warm care and great support of our great leader Chairman Mao. On August 6, 1958, just three days after the formal establishment of the Qilicamp People's Commune, Chairman Mao came to this commune. He was very pleased to inspect the commune's nursing home, kindergarten, commune-run factories, and cotton experimental fields, and issued the great directive that "People's communes are good." Over the past ten years, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Qilicamp Commune, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts, have steadfastly upheld the red banner of "People's communes are good" in the midst of the stormy class struggle. They have overcome numerous difficulties, achieved brilliant victories, and continuously grown and strengthened the people's communes.

On August 6, Qilicamp Commune was filled with the sound of drums and gongs, and red flags were flying. Before dawn, people carried the giant portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao, held the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and sang revolutionary songs as they surged towards the venue from all directions. The meeting began with the majestic song "The East Is Red." At the meeting, people repeatedly raised their arms and shouted: "People's communes are good!" "Invincible Mao Zedong Thought lives forever!" "Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is victorious forever!" "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!" "Wishing our dearest, reddest red sun, Chairman Mao, eternal life! Eternal life!"

At the solemn celebration meeting, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, with their profound proletarian feelings of boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, reviewed the ten-year-long battle course of the people's communes developing and strengthening in the fierce class struggle.

Over the past ten years, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in various places, under the warm care and great support of Chairman Mao, have been single-mindedly determined to build the people's communes well. However, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in various places hated this new thing, the people's communes, to the core and tried to cut down the red flag of the people's communes, which Chairman Mao personally raised. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, stood firmly on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and engaged in a head-on struggle with a handful of class enemies, repelling their repeated ferocious attacks and making the people's communes better and better.

Over the past ten years, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants of Qilicamp People's Commune, with their boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to our great leader Chairman Mao, have read Chairman Mao's books, listened to Chairman Mao's words, and insisted on walking the socialist bright road indicated by Chairman Mao. Especially since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in this commune has taken on a new look. From the commune to each production team, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres have held extensive and in-depth classes to study Mao Zedong Thought, and have carried out the "three loyalties" activities of loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They have raised high the revolutionary banner of criticizing Mao Zedong Thought, launched a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism against the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods spread by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the countryside, and let the great Mao Zedong Thought occupy every position. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants' awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines has been unprecedentedly heightened, and the thought of farming for revolution has been firmly established.

The thorough revolutionization of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants has promoted the great development of production. Over the past ten years, the broad masses of commune members of Qilicamp Commune, with the spirit of moving mountains like the fool of Yu Gong, relying on the unparalleled superiority of the people's communes, have also achieved major successes in their struggle against nature. Over the past ten years, they have repaired and dredged more than 800 rivers, dug 32 relatively large irrigation and drainage canals, drilled more than 400 wells, repaired 62 old wells, and made more than 70% of the arable land in the entire commune achieve "double insurance of wells and rivers, guaranteed harvests in droughts and floods." The area of mechanized farming has expanded from more than 20,000 mu before the establishment of the commune to more than 70,000 mu, accounting for 80% of the total arable land. The mechanization rate in major field operations such as plowing, sowing, weeding, draining, and pest control has reached about 40%. Ten years ago, only four or five large villages in Qilicamp had electricity. After the establishment of the people's commune, relying on the immense power of the collective economy, all 43 brigades in the entire commune have used electric equipment in irrigation, cotton ginning, milling, and oil pressing, and more than 50% of the households have electric lights. The people's communes' ability to resist disasters has been continuously enhanced, and the level of production has been continuously improved. The output of grain and cotton has exceeded the highest levels in history.

Reviewing the ten-year-long battle course of the people's communes developing and strengthening, the broad masses of commune members of Qilicamp Commune deeply felt that following the great leader Chairman Mao is victory! They resolved, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the wise leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, to better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, advance with the momentum of victory, further carry out thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism, purge the poison of counter-revolutionary revisionism spread by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, and turn the people's communes into vibrant schools of Mao Zedong Thought.

Leaders from the Henan Province and Xinyang Region revolutionary committees and the Xinyang Military Sub-district of the People's Liberation Army attended the celebration meeting and spoke at the meeting. They presented Mao Zedong's works and Mao badges to the poor and lower-middle peasants of Qilicamp Commune.

Amidst extremely enthusiastic applause and cheers, the meeting passed a telegram of congratulations to the great leader Chairman Mao. After the meeting, a grand celebration parade was held.

　　新乡地区热烈庆祝毛主席视察七里营人民公社十周年
    十万军民集会，决心在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的英明领导下，更好地活学活用毛泽东思想，进一步肃清中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的反革命修正主义流毒，把人民公社办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校
    新华社郑州十日电　河南省新乡地区广大贫下中农和驻当地人民解放军指战员十万人，八月六日在七里营人民公社举行盛大集会，热烈庆祝伟大领袖毛主席视察七里营人民公社十周年。
    十年前，人民公社这个新生事物刚一出现，就受到了我们伟大领袖毛主席的亲切关怀和巨大支持。一九五八年八月六日——七里营人民公社正式成立后的第三天，毛主席就来到这个公社，十分高兴地视察了公社的敬老院、托儿所、社办工厂和棉花试验田，并发出了“人民公社好”的伟大指示。十年来，七里营公社的广大贫下中农在毛主席光辉思想的指引下，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，坚定不移地高举着“人民公社好”这面红旗奋勇前进。他们战胜重重困难，取得了辉煌胜利，使人民公社不断成长壮大。
    八月六日，七里营公社锣鼓喧天，红旗招展。天不亮，人们就抬着伟大领袖毛主席的巨幅画像，手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，高唱革命歌曲，从四面八方涌向会场。大会在雄壮的《东方红》歌声中开始。会上，人们一遍又一遍地振臂高呼：“人民公社好！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！”“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”“敬祝我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”
    在隆重的庆祝大会上，广大贫下中农怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的深厚无产阶级感情，回顾了人民公社十年来在激烈的阶级斗争中不断发展壮大的战斗历程。
    十年来，各地广大贫下中农在毛主席的亲切关怀和巨大支持的鼓舞下，一心一意要把人民公社建设好。可是，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在各地的代理人，对人民公社这个新生事物怕得要死，恨得要命，他们恶毒地攻击人民公社制度，妄图把毛主席亲自树立的人民公社这面红旗砍掉。用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大贫下中农和革命群众，坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，同一小撮阶级敌人进行针锋相对的斗争，击退了他们一次又一次的猖狂进攻，把人民公社越办越好。
    十年来，七里营人民公社广大贫下中农怀着对我们伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的无产阶级感情，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，坚持走毛主席指引的社会主义光明大道。特别是无产阶级文化大革命以来，这个公社活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动出现了崭新局面，从公社到各个生产队，广大贫下中农和革命干部大办毛泽东思想学习班，广泛深入地开展了忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席革命路线的“三忠于”活动。他们高举毛泽东思想的革命批判大旗，对中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在农村散布的反革命修正主义黑货，展开了深入持久的革命大批判，让伟大的毛泽东思想占领一切阵地。广大贫下中农的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟空前提高，为革命种田的思想牢固地树立了起来。
    广大贫下中农的思想革命化，促进了生产的大发展。十年来，七里营公社广大社员以“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的愚公移山精神，依靠人民公社的无比优越性，在同大自然的搏斗中也取得了重大成就。十年来，他们共整修、疏通了八百多条河道，新挖了三十二条较大的灌河和排河，打机井四百多眼，整修老井六十二眼，使全社百分之七十以上的耕地实现了“井河双保险，旱涝保丰收”。机耕面积由公社成立前的两万多亩，扩大到七万多亩，占总耕地面积的百分之八十。在耕、播、耘、排、治虫等主要田间作业项目中，机械化程度达到了百分之四十左右。十年前，七里营仅仅有四、五个大村子用电。人民公社成立以后，依靠集体经济的巨大威力，全社四十三个大队，在排灌、轧花、磨面、榨油等方面全部用上了电气设备，百分之五十以上的农户有了电灯。人民公社的抗灾能力不断增强，生产水平逐年提高，粮、棉产量都超过了历史上的最高水平。
    回顾十年来人民公社发展壮大的战斗历程，七里营公社的广大社员深切地体会到：紧跟伟大领袖毛主席就是胜利！他们决心在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引下，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的英明领导下，更好地活学活用毛泽东思想，乘胜前进，进一步深入持久地开展革命大批判，肃清中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的反革命修正主义流毒，把人民公社办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    河南省和新乡地区革命委员会以及人民解放军新乡军分区的负责同志，出席了庆祝大会，并在会上讲了话。他们向七里营公社的贫下中农赠送了毛主席著作和毛主席像章。
    在极其热烈的掌声和欢呼声中，大会通过了给伟大领袖毛主席的致敬电。会后，举行了声势浩大的庆祝游行。
