Japanese reactionaries, under the patronage of U.S. imperialism, have been vigorously pushing forward economic militarization under the banner of "strength as a backing and economy as a guide." This is a significant sign of the Japanese monopolistic capitalist groups accelerating the revival of militaristic forces and strengthening economic expansion into Southeast Asia.

	Monopolistic Capitalist Groups Accelerate Development of Arms Industry

The Japanese monopolistic capitalist groups, under the pretext of "domestic production of weapons" and "expanding arms exports," are rapidly expanding and developing arms industry production. In Japan, there are currently over ninety large enterprises or companies producing arms. Representative monopolistic enterprises, such as "Mitsubishi Heavy Industries," "Fujitsu Heavy Industries," and "Toyota Motors," have military production accounting for over ten percent of their total production. Among them, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries' arms production accounts for forty to fifty percent of Japan's total arms industry production, playing a core role in the production of important departments such as aircraft, missiles, warships, electronic machines, and tanks. For example, during the Third Expansion Plan (1967-1971), this company will produce 280 Type 61 tanks and also produce complete equipment for Nike and Hercules missiles.

Japanese companies such as Fuji Heavy Industries, Nissan Motors, Japan Steel Works, and Uraga Heavy Industries are also mass-producing modern conventional weapons such as rockets, cannons, patrol boats, and rifles. Companies like "Toshiba" and "Hitachi," along with thousands of large, medium, and small enterprises under their control, are participating in the production of various aircraft parts. For example, the Hawk missile listed in the "Third Expansion Plan" will have Mitsubishi Electric responsible for seventy percent of the production, and the Mitsubishi system's "Toshiba" will be responsible for thirty percent.

Recently, the Japanese reactionaries, in order to further implement large-scale economic militarization, are vigorously promoting the so-called "giantization" policy of highly concentrating "strategic industries" and "defense industries." For example, after the merger of the three companies under the Kawasaki Monopoly Group of the First Bank of Japan, "Kawasaki Heavy Industries," "Kawasaki Aircraft," and "Kawasaki Vehicles," it will become a comprehensive heavy industry company producing aircraft, ships, machinery, and railway vehicles for "land, sea, and air."

It is worth noting that Japan's current arms industry production is also adopting the so-called "dual-use" development policy, which greatly increases the potential for launching aggressive wars. In the entire industry, the chemical industry accounts for sixty-five percent, which allows the Japanese reactionaries to engage in large-scale production of weapons and strategic materials at any time.

	Increasing Military Expenditures, Accelerating Military Build-up

The Japanese reactionaries' push for economic militarization is also evident in Japan's 1968 national budget. According to this budget, direct military expenditures increased by ten percent compared to the previous year, to expand Japan's army, navy, and air force. The "Foreign Investment Review Committee" approved the import of technology for manufacturing U.S. surface-to-air missiles. According to the "Third Expansion Plan," Japan will spend 53 billion yen to manufacture seventy-two Hawk missile launchers and 216 Hawk missiles, in addition to manufacturing 300 Victory Goddess missiles. The Sato government openly states that the military expenditures in the budget "should not hinder" the implementation of the military expansion plan, even publicly declaring: "The industry that promotes Japan's economic development is the defense industry (i.e., military industry)," and "a certain degree of preemptive strike capability should be established."

The Sato government has significantly strengthened research on military technology. The "Third Military Technology Development Plan Outline" published by the Defense Agency clearly states that weapons and equipment needed for nuclear war are the focus of "research and development." The Japanese government, to implement this development "outline," allocated 33.22 billion yen for military technology research.

In recent years, the Japanese monopolistic capitalist groups have invested large amounts of funds to develop the atomic industry. According to reports, Japan currently has over ten nuclear reactors under construction, including some in universities. The "Tokyo Electric Power Company's First Reactor" and the "Kansai Electric Power Company's First Reactor" are under construction. Uranium processing plants in Ibaraki and Okayama prefectures have started production. Starting this year, the "Reprocessing Plant" established by the "Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation" will be completed in 1971. This plant can process more than 200 kilograms of plutonium per year. Another processing plant currently under expansion will be able to process 220 kilograms of plutonium per year by the end of 1970. At the beginning of this year, Japan signed a new agreement with the United States for a thirty-year supply of enriched uranium and plutonium. According to this agreement, the United States will help Japan build thirteen giant nuclear reactors, providing Japan with more enriched uranium-235 and plutonium than any other country. These facts sufficiently show that the Japanese reactionaries have embarked on the path of developing nuclear weapons. The Sato government's claim that Japan's economy is a "peaceful economy" and the implementation of the "no-nuclear principles" in Japan are all lies.

	Acting as the "Asian Arsenal," Expanding Arms Exports

In addition to providing arms and equipment to the Japanese Self-Defense Forces, Japanese arms industry also provides large quantities of weapons and equipment to the U.S. invading forces in Vietnam and various reactionary regimes in Southeast Asia, playing the role of the U.S.'s "Asian arsenal."

The Japanese monopolistic capitalist groups are becoming increasingly aggressive in exporting arms to various reactionary regimes in Southeast Asia, aiming to realize the arrogant ambition of expanding Japanese militaristic forces into the Southeast Asian region. Especially since the outbreak of the Vietnam War, the Sato reactionary government has "actively cooperated" with U.S. imperialism's invasion of Vietnam, playing a key role as a henchman. Currently, it is even more vigorously providing weapons, ammunition, napalm bombs, chemical poisons, and various military supplies to the U.S. invading forces in Vietnam. Aircraft, warships, cannons, tanks, and other equipment damaged by the heroic Vietnamese military and people in the U.S. invasion of Vietnam are also sent to Japan for repair. It is reported that Japan earns twenty billion dollars annually from the Vietnam War. The Japanese monopolistic capitalist groups reap huge profits from this.

The Japanese reactionaries also actively export weapons, weapon manufacturing industrial equipment, and various military supplies to South Korea, Thailand, Malaya (including Singapore), the Philippines, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. It is reported that in 1967, the export of various military supplies to South Korea, Thailand, the Philippines, Taiwan, and other regions reached 223.2 million dollars, an increase of seventeen percent from the previous year. This year, the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry exported 13,000 automatic rifles produced by the "Fuji Heavy Industries" in collaboration with the United States to Malaya (including Singapore). Previously, this factory had exported 10,000 automatic rifles to Thailand. Japan has already provided the Saigon puppet regime with a complete set of equipment for manufacturing bullets. Recently, it decided to export a complete set of bullet manufacturing equipment worth 1.65 billion yen to the Philippines. A Japanese heavy industry company is currently planning with the reactionary authorities in Singapore to establish the largest shipyard in Southeast Asia. This is an important step for the Japanese reactionaries to expand into Southeast Asia.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "To create disorder, fail, create disorder again, fail again, until they perish—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world when dealing with the people's cause. They will never deviate from this logic."

The result of Japan's economic militarization will inevitably lead to even more distorted economic development and deepening economic and political crises. This will inevitably sharpen class contradictions within Japan and national contradictions between the Japanese people and U.S. imperialism, further intensifying the revolutionary struggles of the Japanese people. The Sato government's attempt to accelerate the revival of Japanese militaristic forces through economic militarization and to follow the old path of Japanese imperialism's invasion of Asia will inevitably face strong counterattacks from the Japanese people and the revolutionary people of Asia, leading only to self-destruction and ultimate doom.

### 日本反动派加紧推行经济军事化

    日本反动派加紧推行经济军事化
    近年来，在美帝国主义的扶植下，佐藤反动政府打起“以实力为后盾、以经济为先导”的旗号，进一步加快了推行经济军事化的步子。这是日本垄断资本集团加速复活军国主义势力，加强向东南亚地区进行经济扩张的一个重要标志。
      垄断资本集团加速发展军火工业
    日本垄断资本集团以所谓“武器国产化”、“扩大军火输出”的名目，正在加紧扩大和发展军火工业生产。在日本，现在生产军火的大企业或大公司有九十家之多。有代表性的垄断企业，例如“三菱重工”、“富士重工”、“丰田汽车”等大型垄断公司所属各工厂的军火生产额，都已经占其生产总额的百分之十以上。其中三菱重工业公司所生产的军火，占日本整个军火工业生产的百分之四十至五十，在飞机、导弹、军舰、电子机器、坦克等军火生产的重要部门跃居“核心”地位。以坦克生产为例，在第三次扩军计划（一九六七——一九七一）期间，这个公司将生产“六一式坦克”二百八十辆，并且还为奈克、赫尔克里士导弹生产全套装备。
    日本丰和工业公司、日产汽车公司、日本制钢厂及浦贺重工业公司等企业，也正在大量生产火箭武器、大炮、护卫舰及步枪等现代化常规武器。“东芝”、“日立”等和它所辖系统下的数千家大中小企业，都参加各种飞机零件的生产。例如，列入“第三次扩军计划”中的隼式导弹，三菱电气公司将负责生产百分之七十，三井系统的“东芝”将负责生产百分之三十。
    最近，日本反动派为了进一步实行大规模的经济军事化，正在加紧推行使“战略工业”、“国防工业”高度集中的所谓“巨型化”政策。例如，日本第一银行系统下的川崎垄断集团的“川崎重工”、“川崎飞机”、“川崎车辆”三家公司合并后，将成为生产飞机、船舶、机械、铁路车辆的“陆、海、空的综合重工业公司”。
    值得注意的是，目前日本的军火工业生产还采取了所谓“和战两用”的发展方针，这就使它极大地增加了发动侵略战争的潜力。在整个工业中化学工业在工业中的比重占百分之六十五。这就使日本反动派有可能随时从事大规模的武器和战略物资的生产。
        不断增加军费，加紧扩军备战
    日本反动派加紧推行经济军事化，从日本一九六八年度国家预算案中也明显地反映出来。按照这个预算案，直接军费比上一个年度增加了百分之十，以扩充日本陆、海、空军部队。日本“外国投资审核委员会”批准进口制造美国地对空导弹的技术。根据“第三次扩军计划”，日本将以五百三十亿日元制造七十二座隼式导弹发射台以及二百一十六枚隼式导弹，另外还制造胜利女神式导弹三百枚。佐藤政府毫不讳言，预算中的军费“不得妨碍”扩军计划的实施，甚至公开叫嚷：“促使日本经济发展的是防卫产业（即军事工业）”，“应该建立能够进行某种程度的先发制人的进攻力量。”
    佐藤政府大大加强了对军事技术的研究工作。日本防卫厅公布的“第三次军事技术发展计划纲要”，明确地把进行核战争需要的武器装备作为“研究、开发”的重点。日本政府为了实现这一发展“纲要”，拨出用于研究军事技术的经费达三百三十二亿二千万日元之巨。
    最近几年来，日本垄断资本集团用大量资金来发展原子工业。据报道，目前日本已开工的原子反应堆，包括一些大学的在内，共有十多个。正在建设中的有“东京电力公司第一号炉”和“关西电力公司第一号炉”。茨城和冈山县加工铀矿的工厂已投入生产。从今年起，由“动力炉核燃料事业团”建立的“再处理厂”，将在一九七一年完成。这个厂一年可以处理钚二百公斤以上。目前正在扩建的另一个加工厂，到一九七○年底，每年可以加工二百二十公斤的钚。今年年初，日本同美国签订一项由美国向日本提供浓缩铀和钚的为期三十年的新协议。根据这项协议，美国帮助日本建立十三个巨大的原子反应堆，美国向日本提供的浓缩铀二三五和钚比向其他任何国家提供的都要多。这些事实足以表明，日本反动派已走上了发展核武器的道路。佐藤政府标榜什么日本经济是“和平经济”，在日本实行“无核三原则”等等，统统都是骗人的鬼话。
    充当“亚洲兵工厂”，扩大军火输出
    日本军火工业，除了向日本自卫队提供军火和装备外，还向侵越美军及东南亚各国反动派提供大量的武器装备，起着美国的“亚洲兵工厂”的作用。
    日本垄断资本集团越来越猖狂地向东南亚各国反动派出口军火，为的是实现日本军国主义势力向东南亚地区进行扩张的狂妄野心。特别是越南战争爆发以来，佐藤反动政府对美帝侵越行动“给予积极合作”，起着得力帮凶作用。目前它更卖力地向侵越美军提供武器、弹药、凝固汽油弹、化学毒药及许多军用物资。美国侵略军在侵越战争中被英雄的越南军民打坏了的飞机、军舰、大炮、坦克等也运到日本修理。据报道，日本每年从侵越战争中得到二十亿美元的“特别军需”。日本垄断资本集团从中攫取巨额的利润。
    日本反动派还积极向南朝鲜、泰国、马来亚（包括新加坡）、菲律宾以及蒋介石匪帮出口武器、制造武器的工业设备以及各种军用物资。据报道，一九六七年对南朝鲜、泰国、菲律宾、台湾等地区出口的各种军需物资达二十二亿三千二百多万美元，比去年增长百分之十七。日本通产省今年向马来亚（包括新加坡）出口“日本丰和工业厂”与美国“技术合作”而生产的自动步枪一万三千支。在这以前，这家工厂已向泰国出口了一万支自动步枪。日本已经向南越傀儡集团提供了制造枪弹的兵工厂全套设备。不久以前它又决定向菲律宾出口价值十六亿五千万日元的制造枪弹的成套设备。日本的一家重工业公司正在同新加坡反动当局策划办一个在东南亚规模最大的造船厂。这是日本反动派向东南亚扩张的一个重要步骤。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席指出：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”
    日本经济军事化的结果，势必使日本经济更加畸形发展，经济政治危机进一步加深。这就必然使日本国内的阶级矛盾和日本人民同美帝国主义的民族矛盾更加尖锐化，促使日本人民革命斗争进一步高涨。佐藤政府妄想通过经济军事化来加速复活日本军国主义势力，重走日本帝国主义侵略亚洲的老路，必然遭到日本人民和亚洲各国革命人民强有力的反击，只能是自掘坟墓，走向最后的灭亡。
