Revolutionary workers at Guiyang Coal Mine have thoroughly criticized the bourgeois technical "authorities," fully unleashing the leading role of the working class in production technology. The entire mine has seen a new situation, with monthly overfulfillment of the state plan since the beginning of this year.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, August 23rd—Under the assistance of the People's Liberation Army's leftist cadre, the Guiyang Coal Mine Revolutionary Committee led the broad revolutionary masses in a thorough criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist scientific and technological line of China's Khrushchev. They smashed the bourgeois technical "authorities'" monopoly on technology, allowing revolutionary workers and revolutionary technical personnel to seize control of technological power. This fully unleashed the leading role of the working class in the field of production technology. Mining, tunneling, transportation, and other production activities in the entire mine have all shown a thriving situation. Since the beginning of this year, the average daily output of raw coal has increased by 50% compared to the highest daily output before the Cultural Revolution.

Since the establishment of Guiyang Coal Mine, a small clique of capitalists within the party has promoted China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist scientific and technological line, advocating for "experts running the factory" and spreading reactionary fallacies such as "technology first," claiming that workers cannot master technology. In the ten years since the mine's establishment, not a single worker has been promoted to a technical position, and technological power has been in the hands of bourgeois technical "authorities," greatly suppressing the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of workers and revolutionary technical personnel.

Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches: "The lowly are the wisest! The noble are the most foolish," "The wisest and most talented are those with the most practical experience." During the revolutionary criticism, the mine's revolutionary committee led the broad revolutionary workers to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, using a large number of vivid facts to expose the crimes of China's Khrushchev and the small clique of capitalists within the mine in promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist scientific and technological line. They exposed the true form of the bourgeois technical "authorities" as paper tigers, greatly boosting the morale of the proletariat and crushing the arrogance of the bourgeoisie. Technical personnel within the workers' ranks have grown vigorously. The facts have proven that those bourgeois technical "authorities" who regard workers as "fools" are actually the most foolish. A bourgeois technical "authority" who was highly praised by the capitalist roaders once declared that a coal mine had no more coal and should be "abandoned" immediately. However, the workers, relying on their years of practical experience, revived this coal mine from the hands of the bourgeois technical "authorities," allowing it to continue production.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary workers, revolutionary technical personnel, and revolutionary cadres of this coal mine, under the guidance of the great thought of Mao Zedong, implemented the "three-in-one combination" (workers, cadres, and technical personnel), achieving unprecedented outstanding results in production technology reform. The broad masses of workers, with the great ambition to produce more coal for the revolution, carried out extensive technological innovations. In just one month recently, the entire mine achieved ten major technological innovations in the transportation sector, including a thorough reform of the equipment relied upon by the capitalist roaders and the bourgeois technical "authorities," nearly doubling the transportation capacity. Those who carried out these ten technological innovations were not others but a few electricians and ordinary workers who were once scorned as "fools" by the bourgeois technical "authorities."

The Guiyang Coal Mine Revolutionary Committee, by thoroughly criticizing China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, fully unleashed the leading role of the working masses in production technology. Since the beginning of this year, the entire mine has monthly overfulfilled the state plan.

    贵阳煤矿革命职工大破资产阶级技术“权威”
    充分发挥工人阶级在生产技术上的领导作用
    全矿生产出现新局面，今年以来，月月超额完成国家计划
    据新华社贵阳二十三日电　贵阳煤矿革命委员会在解放军支左人员帮助下，带领广大革命群众狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义科技路线，大破资产阶级技术“权威”的“技术垄断”，革命工人和革命技术人员掌握了技术大权，充分发挥了工人阶级在生产技术领域里的领导作用。全矿采煤、掘进、运输等生产，都出现了蓬蓬勃勃的局面。今年以来，原煤平均日产水平，比文化大革命以前的最高日产水平提高百分之五十。
    贵阳煤矿建矿以来，党内一小撮走资派推行中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义科技路线，大搞“专家治厂”，鼓吹“技术第一”等反动谬论，认为工人根本不能掌握技术。建矿十年以来，全矿没有提拔一个工人担任技术员工作，技术大权掌握在资产阶级技术“权威”的手里，极大地压制了广大工人群众和革命技术人员的积极性、创造性。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“卑贱者最聪明！高贵者最愚蠢”，“最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”在革命大批判中，这个煤矿革委会领导广大革命职工，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，用大量的生动事实，揭露了中国赫鲁晓夫和矿内一小撮走资派推行反革命修正主义科技路线的罪行，暴露了资产阶级技术“权威”的纸老虎原形，大长了无产阶级的志气，大灭了资产阶级的威风。工人队伍中的技术人员茁壮成长。事实证明，那些把工人看作“蠢人”的资产阶级技术“权威”，实际上最蠢最蠢。有个被走资派佩服得五体投地的资产阶级技术“权威”，曾经断定一个煤井没有煤了，叫赶快“下马”报废。可是，工人们凭着多年实践的经验，使这个煤井从资产阶级技术“权威”手里起死回生，继续生产。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，这个煤矿的革命工人、革命技术人员、革命干部，在伟大的毛泽东思想指引下，实行三结合，在改革生产技术上创造了建矿以来从未有过的出色的成就。广大工人群众怀着为革命多出煤的雄心壮志，大搞技术革新。最近短短一个月，全矿运输方面就实现了十项重大技术革新，其中包括对走资派依靠资产阶级技术“权威”搞的设备的彻底改造，使运输能力提高了将近一倍。搞这十项技术革新的不是别人，正是过去被资产阶级技术“权威”当面斥为“蠢人”的几个电机工和其他的普通工人。
    贵阳煤矿革命委员会由于狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，充分发挥了工人群众在生产技术上的领导作用，今年以来，全矿月月超额完成国家计划。
