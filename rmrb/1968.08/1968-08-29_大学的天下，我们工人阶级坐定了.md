	Editor Comrades:
	Chairman Mao is the closest to us, the workers' class, and we, the workers' class, are the most loyal to our great leader Chairman Mao. Now, Chairman Mao has called on us to form Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams to go to the schools. He also wants us to "stay in the schools for a long time, participate in all the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and permanently lead the schools." We will actively respond to Chairman Mao's great call, join the Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams, and march into the schools to resolutely complete the glorious combat mission entrusted to us by Chairman Mao.

	In the past, universities were under the control of the revisionist educational line and had become "independent kingdoms" of the bourgeoisie. Such schools, the more you study, the more you become revisionist. How could they cultivate successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution? Such schools, we laboring people cannot stand and do not need! However, in the past, we only hated this phenomenon and hoped it could change, but we never thought that one day we would participate in changing this phenomenon. At first, I had some reservations, thinking that I couldn't write well or speak well, and that I couldn't lead the Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team. I brought this question to Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said: "What is work? Work is struggle. Where there are difficulties and problems, we need to go and solve them. We go to work and struggle to solve difficulties. The more difficult the place, the more we should go, this is what a good comrade does." With Chairman Mao supporting us, what difficulties can we not overcome! With this in mind, I am full of energy. If we workers' class do not occupy the university stronghold, who will? We workers' class must attack these bourgeois fortresses. In the past, we couldn't even stick a needle in, but today we workers' class will definitely stick it in! In the past, water couldn't get in, but today we workers' class will definitely pour it in! The world is created by the laboring people. We not only have the right to go in but also to stay for a long time! The universities are now under the control of the workers' class!

	Now, the first batch of Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams from our factory has marched into Fudan University. We are determined to forge our team into a strong revolutionary team, to grasp the study of Mao Zedong Thought, to grasp the class struggle, to do a good job of investigation and research, and to constantly criticize and resist the infiltration of bourgeois ideology. In the struggle, we will constantly improve our political awareness. Together with the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and the active elements among the students, teachers, and workers in the school who are determined to carry the proletarian educational revolution to the end, we will turn the university into a big school of Mao Zedong Thought.

    大学的天下，我们工人阶级坐定了编辑同志：
    毛主席对我们工人阶级最亲，我们工人阶级对伟大领袖毛主席最忠。现在，毛主席叫我们组成工人毛泽东思想宣传队到学校去，并且要我们“在学校中长期留下去，参加学校中全部斗、批、改任务，并且永远领导学校。”我们就要积极响应毛主席的伟大号令，参加工人毛泽东思想宣传队，开进学校去，坚决完成毛主席交给我们的光荣的战斗任务。
    过去，大学在修正主义教育路线的统治下，成了资产阶级的“独立王国”。这样的学校，真是越学越修，那里能培养出无产阶级革命事业的接班人？这样的学校，我们劳动人民看不惯，不需要！然而，过去只是痛恨这种现象，希望能改变这种现象，却从来没有想到今天自己会去参加改变这种现象的工作。一开始自己还有些顾虑，认为我写不来，讲不好，担任工人毛泽东思想宣传队的领导工作能行吗？我带着这个问题请教毛主席著作，毛主席说：“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。那些地方有困难、有问题，需要我们去解决。我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”有毛主席为我们撑腰，还有什么困难不能克服！想到这里，我浑身是劲。我们工人阶级不去占领大学阵地，谁去占领！我们工人阶级就是要向这些资产阶级顽固堡垒进攻。过去针插不进，今天我们工人阶级偏要插！过去水泼不进，今天我们工人阶级偏要泼！世界是劳动人民创造的，我们不但要理直气壮地进去，而且还要长期留下去！大学的天下，我们工人阶级坐定了！
    现在，我厂首批工人毛泽东思想宣传队已经开进了复旦大学。我们决心把自己这支队伍锻炼成一支坚强的革命化的队伍，狠抓毛泽东思想的学习，狠抓阶级斗争不转向，认真地做好调查研究工作，还要不断批判和抵制资产阶级思想的侵蚀，在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟，和解放军战士一起，同学校的学生、教员、工人中决心把无产阶级教育革命进行到底的积极分子一起，把大学办成毛泽东思想大学校。进驻上海复旦大学工人毛泽东思想宣传队上海柴油机厂青年女工郭三珍
