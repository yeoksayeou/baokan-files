The British authorities in Hong Kong, disregarding the solemn warning of the Chinese people and the strong protests of patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong, brazenly announced on the afternoon of the 14th that they would cancel the registration of the patriotic school Chung Hwa Middle School and issued an unreasonable order to cancel the registration. This is another fascist atrocity committed by the British authorities in Hong Kong against our patriotic compatriots in the past year, and it is another serious step taken by the British authorities in Hong Kong to deliberately create tension in Hong Kong. Patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong are extremely indignant about this and resolutely counter the new provocation by British imperialism.

In the early hours of the 15th, Chung Hwa Middle School issued a statement, strongly protesting against the fascist atrocity committed by the British authorities in Hong Kong, and put forward five solemn demands to the British authorities in Hong Kong: immediately withdraw the unreasonable decision to cancel the registration of Chung Hwa Middle School; immediately return the school premises of Chung Hwa Middle School and guarantee the right to free use; guarantee the right of all teachers and staff of Chung Hwa Middle School to continue working in the school; immediately release the principal of Chung Hwa Middle School, Huang Zuofen, and other patriotic teachers and students who are still in prison; compensate for all losses incurred by Chung Hwa Middle School due to the persecution.

As early as more than twenty days ago, the British authorities in Hong Kong, who had long been plotting, began to implement their scheme to further persecute Chung Hwa Middle School. The patriotic teachers, staff, parents, and alumni of Chung Hwa Middle School, with the support of the broad patriotic compatriots and patriotic teachers and students, bravely fought against the British authorities in Hong Kong in a head-on struggle.

The brave struggle of the patriotic teachers, staff, parents, and alumni of Chung Hwa Middle School has received the firm support of the broad patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong and Kowloon Patriotic Compatriots' Committee to Oppose British Persecution and various workers, students, teachers, film industry, news media, business community, and street residents have issued statements and held meetings, strongly protesting against the fascist atrocities of British imperialism. The spokesperson of the Guangdong Province Patriotic Compatriots' Committee to Support the Anti-British and Anti-Violence Struggle of Hong Kong and Kowloon also issued a statement on August 3, condemning the new persecution of the British authorities in Hong Kong against our patriotic compatriots and firmly supporting the just struggle of Chung Hwa Middle School. However, the British authorities in Hong Kong ignored the solemn warning of the Chinese people and the strong protests of the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong, and took the serious step of worsening the situation in Hong Kong, announcing in the afternoon of the 14th that the "procedure for canceling the registration of Chung Hwa Middle School has been completed," and the British "Governor" David Trench, together with the "Executive Council," issued the reactionary order to unreasonably cancel the registration of Chung Hwa Middle School.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, till their doom—for it is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries to oppose the people's cause; they are doomed to such a doom." The British authorities in Hong Kong's insistence on canceling the registration of Chung Hwa Middle School fully exposes their imperialist nature of hostility towards the Chinese people and reflects their extremely weak and rotten essence.

Since May of last year, the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong have fought back against British imperialism's crazy violence and oppression with great force and tenacious struggle, dealing heavy blows to British imperialism and causing it to suffer huge losses politically and economically. The patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong have won victory after victory. In this struggle against British imperialism, the invincible Mao Zedong Thought has been widely spread and popularized. Tens of thousands of patriotic compatriots have participated in various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and hundreds of thousands have participated in various anti-British and anti-violence struggle activities and meetings. They have exposed the brutal exploitation and persecution of British imperialism over the past hundred years against our patriotic compatriots, raised their class consciousness and political awareness, developed the patriotic cause, and strengthened the anti-imperialist and patriotic forces. In the field of patriotic education, despite the various horrifying fascist persecutions carried out by the British authorities, including the deployment of military and police forces to launch armed attacks and raids on our 18 patriotic schools, and the arrest of 455 patriotic teachers and students, 172 of whom were thrown into prison, this not only failed to harm our patriotic education cause but also promoted its development. Several dozen patriotic schools, in the struggle against British imperialism, have raised the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher. The broad patriotic teachers and students have launched a campaign to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, significantly raising their class consciousness and political awareness, and the patriotic student movement has reached an unprecedented new high. In the first half of this year, due to the significant increase in the number of students, many patriotic schools have set up branch schools. The number of students in the next semester has increased by 50% compared to before, and all patriotic schools are presenting an unprecedented prosperous scene.

The British fascist authorities are extremely fearful of the unprecedented surge in the anti-imperialist and patriotic movement among patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and the great development of the patriotic education cause. In June and July of this year, high-ranking military and police officials participating in the "riot control training class" of the British authorities expressed their deep concern about the current situation in Hong Kong, especially the emergence of the new political situation where the great Mao Zedong Thought is widely spread and popularized among patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong. At the same time, they revealed a vicious and brutal appearance, attempting to obstruct the invincible spread of Mao Zedong Thought. In recent months, the British authorities, on the one hand, have colluded with American imperialism and the Kuomintang bandits, using their newspapers to slander and defame our anti-imperialist and patriotic cause and create reactionary "public opinion." On the other hand, they continue to further persecute our patriotic compatriots.

However, as our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The various kinds of oppression inflicted by the reactionaries of all countries on the revolutionary people, in the final analysis, only serve to promote the more extensive and more violent revolution of the people." The new atrocities of the British fascist authorities will only prompt the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong to quickly launch a new high tide of opposition to the new persecution of British imperialism, exposing the evil policy of British imperialism in promoting slave education and destroying the patriotic education cause. Patriotic compatriots from all walks of life have held more than 50 protest meetings and mass denunciation meetings on the Chung Hwa Middle School incident. Many people have taken to the streets, writing slogans and distributing leaflets, exposing the new crimes of British imperialism. Recently, students in schools controlled by the forces of American, British, and Kuomintang imperialism have also risen up to denounce British imperialism's slave education. Many facts prove that the British authorities' new persecution of our patriotic compatriots will only "lift a stone to drop on their own feet" and will not end well.

The patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong solemnly warn the British authorities in Hong Kong: your rampant persecution of patriotic compatriots is merely a desperate struggle. The debts you owe to the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong must be repaid.

    港英当局不顾我国人民严正警告悍然宣布取消中华中学注册
    香港各界爱国同胞坚决回击港英新挑衅
    中华中学向港英当局提出五项严正要求
    据新华社十六日讯  香港英国当局不顾我国人民的严正警告和香港爱国同胞的强烈抗议，十四日下午悍然宣布取消爱国学校中华中学的注册，签发了无理取消注册的反动命令。这是一年多来港英当局对我爱国同胞的又一新的法西斯暴行，是港英当局蓄意制造香港紧张局势的又一个严重步骤。香港爱国同胞对此表示极大的愤慨，坚决回击港英帝国主义的新挑衅。
    十五日凌晨，中华中学发表声明，强烈抗议港英当局的法西斯暴行，并向港英当局提出五项严正要求：立即收回撤销中华中学注册的无理决定；立即交回中华中学校舍，并保证自由使用的权利；保障中华中学全体教职员工继续留校工作的权利；立即释放中华中学校长黄祖芬及其他仍被投入黑狱的爱国师生；赔偿中华中学因遭受迫害而引起的一切损失。
    早在二十多天前，蓄谋已久的港英当局就开始进行进一步迫害中华中学的阴谋计划，中华中学的爱国师生员工、家长、校友，在广大爱国同胞和爱国师生的支持下，英勇地和港英当局进行了针锋相对的斗争。
    中华中学爱国师生员工、家长、校友的英勇斗争，得到了香港广大爱国同胞的坚决支持。港九各界同胞反对港英迫害斗争委员会和各业工人、学生、教师、电影界、新闻界、工商界和街道居民，纷纷发表声明和举行集会，强烈抗议港英帝国主义的法西斯暴行。广东省人民支援港九爱国同胞反英抗暴斗争委员会发言人，也在八月三日发表谈话，谴责港英当局对我爱国同胞的新迫害，坚决支持中华中学的正义斗争。可是，港英当局却漠视我国人民的严正警告和香港爱国同胞的强烈抗议，一意孤行地采取了恶化香港局势的严重步骤，十四日下午公然宣布处理“取消中华中学注册的手续已经完毕”，港英“总督”戴麟趾已会同“行政局”，签发了无理取消中华中学注册的反动命令。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”香港英国当局一意孤行地取消中华中学的注册，充分说明它敌视中国人民的帝国主义本性，反映了它极端虚弱腐朽的本质。
    去年五月以来，香港爱国同胞对港英帝国主义疯狂的暴力镇压进行了有力的回击和英勇顽强的斗争，给港英帝国主义以沉重的打击，使它在政治上经济上遭到巨大的损失，香港爱国同胞取得了一个又一个胜利。在这场反对港英帝国主义的斗争中，战无不胜的毛泽东思想得到了大传播、大普及，数万名爱国同胞分别参加了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，几十万人参加了各种各样的反英抗暴斗争活动和各种集会，对港英帝国主义一百多年来残酷剥削和迫害我爱国同胞的暴行，进行血泪控诉，提高了阶级觉悟和政治觉悟，发展了爱国事业和壮大了反帝爱国力量。在爱国教育事业方面，尽管港英当局进行了各种骇人听闻的法西斯迫害，包括出动军警，先后二十五次武装袭击和搜劫我十八家爱国学校，拘捕我爱国师生员工四百五十五人，其中一百七十二人被投入黑狱。但是，这不仅不能损害我爱国教育事业，而且更促进我爱国教育事业的发展。几十家爱国学校在反英抗暴斗争中，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，广大爱国师生开展了活学活用毛主席著作的运动，阶级觉悟和政治觉悟有了显著的提高，爱国学生运动出现空前的新高涨。今年上半年，由于学生数目大幅度地增加，许多爱国学校增设了分教处，下学期的学生人数比以前增达百分之五十，所有的爱国学校都呈现着一片空前未有的兴旺景象。
    港英法西斯当局对香港爱国同胞反帝爱国运动的空前高涨和爱国教育事业的壮大发展，十分恐惧。今年六、七月间港英高级军警官员参加的“防暴训练班”，就对当前的香港局势，特别是对伟大的毛泽东思想在香港爱国同胞中大传播、大普及的新政治局面的出现，表示忧心忡忡，同时又露出一副穷凶极恶的残暴相，妄图遏阻战无不胜的毛泽东思想的传播。最近几个月，港英当局一方面勾结美帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮，利用他们的报纸，对我反帝爱国事业大肆造谣污蔑，制造反动“舆论”，另方面则继续进一步迫害我爱国同胞。
    但是，正如我们伟大领袖毛主席英明地指出的：各国反动派“对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命”。港英法西斯当局的新暴行，更加促使香港爱国同胞迅速掀起了一个反对港英帝国主义新迫害、控诉港英推行奴化教育、摧残爱国教育事业的罪恶政策的新高潮。各阶层爱国同胞就中华中学事件，先后举行了五十多次抗议集会和群众控诉会，许多群众走上街头，写标语、散传单，大揭港英帝国主义新罪行。在美帝、英帝和蒋帮势力控制下的学校学生，最近也纷纷起来控诉港英帝国主义的奴化教育。许多事实证明，港英当局对我爱国同胞的新迫害，只能“搬起石头打自己的脚”，绝不会有好下场的。
    香港爱国同胞严正地警告港英当局，你们猖狂迫害爱国同胞只是一种垂死的挣扎，你们欠下香港爱国同胞的债是一定要偿还的。
