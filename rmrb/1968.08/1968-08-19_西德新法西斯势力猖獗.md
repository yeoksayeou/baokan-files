With the tacit approval and support of the West German reactionary authorities, the German National Democratic Party, which represents the neo-fascist forces in West Germany, is rapidly expanding its influence and engaging in extensive activities, aiming to realize the dream of restoring the "Greater German Reich."

In less than four years since its establishment, the National Democratic Party has already recruited 40,000 members. Currently, it has branches in 76% of the cities and counties in West Germany. It is reported that nearly half of the party's leadership are either old Nazis from before 1933 or key members of the Nazi Party.

From the winter of 1966 to the present, seven out of the ten states in West Germany have held parliamentary elections. This party has secured seats in the parliaments of all seven states.

In recent years, this fascist party has been frenziedly inciting militarism and revanchism. In its platform, it arrogantly demands the restoration of the "entire German borders (referring to the borders of 1937) and the Sudetenland" and the use of "all appropriate means" to achieve the "reunification" of Germany.

Just as the West German monopoly capitalists once supported Hitler's fascism, they are now vigorously backing the National Democratic Party. It is revealed that major companies such as the West German Shell Oil Company, the Badische Anilin- und Soda-Fabrik, and the Klockner and Erco conglomerates are providing substantial financial support to the National Democratic Party.

While the West German reactionary authorities are forcibly pushing through the "Emergency Powers Act" and intensifying the persecution and suppression of progressive forces, they are indulging and protecting the National Democratic Party. The West German Ministry of the Interior has repeatedly refused to ban the National Democratic Party. The West German ruling class and the neo-fascist party are birds of a feather.

    西德新法西斯势力猖獗
    新华社波恩电　在西德反动当局的纵容和支持下，代表西德新法西斯势力的德国国家民主党，正在加紧扩充实力，大肆进行活动，妄图实现恢复“大德意志帝国”的美梦。
    国家民主党在建立不到四年的时间里，已经收罗了四万名党徒。目前，它在西德百分之七十六的城市和县中设有分支机构。据报道，国家民主党的领导成员中近半数的人是一九三三年以前的老纳粹分子或者是纳粹党的骨干分子。
    从一九六六年冬季到现在，西德全部十个州中有七个州举行了议会选举。这个党在所有七个州的议会里都获得了席位。
    这个法西斯党近年来，疯狂进行军国主义和复仇主义的煽动。这个党在它的纲领中狂妄地叫嚷要恢复“整个德国疆界（意指一九三七年的疆界）和苏台德地区”，要用“一切适合的手段”来重新“统一”德国。
    象当年扶植希特勒法西斯一样，西德垄断资本集团正在大力扶植国家民主党。据透露，西德壳牌汽油公司、巴登苯胺苏打厂以及科维勒和厄特克康采恩等大公司都给予国家民主党大量财政支持。
    西德反动当局在强行通过“紧急状态法”、加紧迫害和镇压进步力量的同时，对国家民主党都百般纵容和庇护。西德内政部多次断然拒绝禁止国家民主党。西德统治集团和新法西斯党是一丘之貉。
