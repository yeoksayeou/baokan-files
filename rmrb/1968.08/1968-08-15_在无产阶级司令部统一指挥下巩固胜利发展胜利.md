In the glorious annals of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, people will never forget the radiant August of 1966. It was at that time that our great leader Chairman Mao personally presided over the convening of the historic Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, issuing the battle cry to bombard the headquarters of the bourgeoisie. He personally drafted the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Concerning the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution" and personally went among the masses, instructing the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses across the country: "You must concern yourselves with state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" He also ascended Tiananmen Gate to receive and review the cultural revolutionary army. From then on, the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, initiated and led by Chairman Mao, broke through the obstruction of the reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev, surging across the entire country with the force of a storm and the power of thunder.

Two years later, in August, as this great revolution entered its third year, we faced an unprecedentedly good situation. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the command of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses across the country, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, defeated the bourgeois headquarters headed by the Chinese Khrushchev, scattering them like fallen flowers. The revolutionary committees born in the storm of class struggle, combining the three elements, are increasingly demonstrating their great power. Especially, the unprecedented spread of Mao Zedong Thought has greatly promoted the ideological revolutionization of the people across the country.

However, the class enemy will not resign themselves to defeat. The closer the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution gets to complete victory, the more the class enemy will struggle desperately. They are using various methods, both open and secret, direct and indirect, attempting to achieve the goal of destroying revolutionary forces while preserving reactionary forces. Spreading the reactionary bourgeois "multi-center theory" is one of the despicable tricks the class enemy is using to destroy revolutionary forces and preserve reactionary forces. A small handful of class enemies, in their desperate attempt to save themselves from annihilation, will inevitably make a last-ditch struggle, which we have long anticipated. It is noteworthy that within the revolutionary ranks, some people, in the face of victory, become swollen-headed, and their bourgeois individualism flares up. In their words and deeds, they practice the "multi-center theory." Things like "I am the center" and "if it doesn't align with my or my organization's interests, I won't comply"! Whether consciously or unconsciously, such actions objectively do things that hurt friends and please enemies, perfectly meeting the needs of the class enemy at their wit's end. We must shout at such people: You've fallen into the class enemy's trap! We must thoroughly criticize this reactionary theory of the "multi-center."

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Chinese Communist Party is the leadership core of the entire Chinese people. Without such a core, the cause of socialism cannot be victorious." The proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin is the sole leadership center for the entire Party, the entire army, the entire country, and the broad revolutionary masses. The entire Party, the entire army, the entire country can only have such a center, and cannot have a second center. The reason the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved such great victories is fundamentally due to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, Chairman Mao's great genius and lofty prestige, and the wise, correct, and unified leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao. What the class enemy fears the most is precisely this. Therefore, they use every means to spread rumors and stir up trouble, attempting to resist and shake the leadership center of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. If the reactionary "multi-center theory" is not criticized in time and its influence thoroughly purged, it will have the effect of dispersing unity, creating divisions, and hindering the implementation of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line within the revolutionary ranks. Those who advocate the "multi-center theory," no matter what excuses they use or how they argue, are actually harming the lifeline of the Chinese people—the revolutionary leadership center of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao; they are actually trying to restore the root of misfortune for the Chinese people—the reactionary center of the bourgeois headquarters headed by the Chinese Khrushchev.

Chairman Mao said: "Communist Party members must understand the principle of subordinating partial needs to overall needs." Some people, on the contrary, want the whole to serve the part. They want to be the "center," treating the units and groups they temporarily lead as independent kingdoms, reaching out in all directions, making connections everywhere, and using every means to expand their own little fiefdoms, developing factionalism and cliquism, and not executing the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters, interfering with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments. If they do not stop immediately and correct their ways, they will head down the dangerous path of opposing the proletarian headquarters.

Those who are infatuated with being the "center" should understand that the "center" is not self-proclaimed but is formed in the struggle. Those who shout every day about being the "center" actually prove that they cannot be the center because their minds are filled with bourgeois individualism. Being blinded by bourgeois individualism will ultimately lead to downfall. The Chinese Khrushchev was one who shouted about being the "center," and in the end, wasn't he completely overthrown? In the Cultural Revolution, a small handful of conspirators, careerists, and counter-revolutionary two-faced people who wanted to be the "center" were also one by one overthrown. To advocate being the "center" and want to be independent from the proletarian headquarters is like "a tiny ant trying to shake a big tree, laughably overestimating oneself." Apart from being eliminated by the surging tide of the Cultural Revolution, there will be no better outcome.

Now, at this critical moment of seizing the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must more closely unite around the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, strengthen the concept of the whole, strengthen revolutionary organizational discipline, and bring our every word and deed completely into the revolutionary track of the proletariat. We must fully implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, unconditionally carry out all the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters, and under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, unify our will, unify our steps, and unify our actions to seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

　　在无产阶级司令部统一指挥下巩固胜利发展胜利
　　铁道兵某部驻北京钢铁学院毛泽东思想宣传队
    在无产阶级文化大革命的壮丽的史册上，人们永远不会忘记一九六六年的光辉的八月。正是在那个时候，我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持召开了具有伟大历史意义的党的八届十一中全会，发出了炮打资产阶级司令部的战斗号令，亲自主持制定了《中国共产党中央委员会关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》，亲自深入到广大群众中间，指示全国无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”并且登上天安门，接见和检阅文化革命大军。从此，毛主席亲自发动和领导的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动，冲破了中国赫鲁晓夫资产阶级反动路线的阻挠，以排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力，磅礴于全中国。
    两年后的八月，当这场伟大的革命进入第三个年头的时候，我们面临的是一派空前的大好形势。在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，在毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的指挥下，全国无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部打得落花流水。在阶级斗争风暴中诞生的三结合的革命委员会，越来越显示出强大的威力。特别是毛泽东思想空前大普及，大大促进了全国人民的思想革命化。
    但是，阶级敌人是不会甘心于他们的失败的。无产阶级文化大革命越是接近全面胜利，阶级敌人越是要作垂死挣扎。他们正在采用各种方法：公开的和秘密的，直接的和迂回的，妄图达到破坏革命势力而保存反动势力的目的。散布反动的资产阶级的“多中心论”，正是阶级敌人力图破坏革命势力、保存反动势力而采用的卑鄙伎俩之一。一小撮阶级敌人妄想挽救自己的灭亡，必然要作拚死挣扎，这是我们早已预料到的。值得注意的是：在革命队伍中，有的人在胜利面前，头脑膨胀，资产阶级个人主义发作，在他们的言行中实践着“多中心论”。什么“以我为中心”啦，“不符合我和我这个组织的利益就不服从”啦！这样做，不管自觉或是不自觉，在客观上都是干了使亲者痛，仇者快的事，正好适应了穷途末路的阶级敌人的需要。对于这样的人，我们必须大喝一声：你上了阶级敌人的当了！对于“多中心论”这一反动理论，我们必须彻底批判。
    毛主席教导我们：“中国共产党是全中国人民的领导核心。没有这样一个核心，社会主义事业就不能胜利。”以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，是全党、全军、全国和广大革命群众唯一的领导中心。全党、全军、全国只能有这样一个中心，不能有第二个中心。无产阶级文化大革命所以能够取得这样伟大的胜利，最根本的是靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，靠毛主席的伟大天才和崇高威望，靠毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的英明、正确、统一的领导。阶级敌人最害怕的也就是这个。因此，他们千方百计造谣生事，挑拨离间，妄图抵制和动摇以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部这个领导中心。对于反动的“多中心论”，如果不及时批判，彻底肃清其影响，就会在革命队伍内部起到涣散团结，制造分裂，妨碍毛主席无产阶级革命路线贯彻执行的破坏作用。搞“多中心论”的人，不管他们以什么借口，不管怎样诡辩，实际上他们是在损害中国人民的命根子——以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部这个革命领导中心；实际上是要恢复中国人民的祸根子——以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部这个反动中心。
    毛主席说：“共产党员必须懂得以局部需要服从全局需要这一个道理。”有的人恰恰相反，他们要的是整体服从局部，他们要“以我为中心”，把自己暂时领导的单位和团体当作独立王国，到处伸手，四方挂钩，千方百计扩大自己的小山头，发展宗派主义和山头主义，不执行无产阶级司令部的战斗号令，干扰毛主席的伟大战略部署。如果不悬崖勒马，坚决改正，就会走上对抗无产阶级司令部的危险道路上去。
    迷恋“以我为中心”的人应当懂得，“中心”不是自封的，是在斗争中形成的。那些天天喊着要“以我为中心”的人，恰好证明他们当不了中心，因为他头脑里装的是资产阶级个人主义。让资产阶级个人主义迷住了心窍，到头来总是要垮台的。中国赫鲁晓夫就是个叫喊着要“以我为中心”的人，结果不是彻底垮台了吗？在文化大革命中揭发出来的一小撮阴谋家、野心家、反革命两面派，也是要“以我为中心”的，结果也是一个个地垮台了。搞“以我为中心”，想跟无产阶级司令部闹独立性，那真是“蚍蜉撼大树，可笑不自量”，除了被文化大革命的滚滚洪流所淘汰，决不会有更好的下场。
    现在，正是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的关键时刻，我们更应当紧紧地团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的周围，加强整体观念，加强革命的组织纪律性，把自己的一言一行，完全纳入无产阶级的革命轨道。我们一定要全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，不折不扣地贯彻执行无产阶级司令部的一切战斗号令，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的领导下，统一意志，统一步伐，统一行动，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
