A rainbow stretches across the sky, illuminating the five continents and four seas, and a million voices join in thunderous applause… Great proletariat—locomotive of the times, great proletariat—red vanguard of the revolution! Looking back, the years have been tumultuous, but today, the land is draped in red. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have built new achievements for the people. We march in great numbers into the schools, keeping Chairman Mao's latest instructions in our hearts. With Mao Zedong Thought, we seize the educational battlefield, and the proletariat vows to be the main force of the revolution! We unite with the broad revolutionary teachers and students to fan the flames of educational revolution higher and higher, and to sweep the storm of struggle, criticism, and transformation more and more fiercely. We are filled with the spirit of battle, launching a fierce attack on the class enemy. The great proletariat—bold, steadfast, clear-eyed, and red-hearted, the most thorough in revolution, the most resolute in stance, the most loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao! We are forever—the leading class that leads everything, we are forever—the iron wall against revisionism, we are forever—the locomotive of the times, we are forever—the vanguard that opens up the land and liberates all mankind!
