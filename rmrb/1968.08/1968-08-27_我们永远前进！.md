	We Will Always March Forward!
	Zhang Hu, Worker of Beijing Conical Gear Factory
	Meng Duiquan, Worker of Beijing Second Machine Tool Factory

	The whistle blows, the wheels roll, and the train of the times is advancing by leaps and bounds. The mighty force of Chairman Mao's latest instructions pushes hundreds of millions of people forward to a new stage. The vast ranks of industrial workers are marching towards all units that have not yet carried out the struggle, criticism, and reform. The working class must lead everything; this is a great historical mission. With the great leader Chairman Mao backing us, we have boundless energy. We will carry out every order from the proletarian headquarters and strive for even greater heights! What is the "multi-center means no center" theory? What is the "independent kingdom"? What is the "hard-to-handle" problem? The working class will charge towards these "fortresses"! Beloved Chairman Mao, we offer you our loyal hearts. We fear not the mountains of knives and seas of fire. With the wind and waves, we follow you and learn to swim. The red sun illuminates the rivers and mountains. The working class is determined to make the greatest efforts. Chairman Mao points the way, and we will always march forward! Forward!

    北京第二机床厂工人　孟代泉笛声长鸣，车轮滚滚，时代的列车在突飞猛进，毛主席最新指示的强大动力，把亿万人民推向新的里程。浩浩荡荡的产业工人，向一切没搞好斗、批、改的单位进军，工人阶级必须领导一切，这是伟大的历史使命。有最高统帅毛主席撑腰，我们浑身有使不完的劲，执行无产阶级司令部每一个号令，向着更高的峰顶攀登！什么“多中心即无中心论”，什么“独立王国”，什么“老大难”，工人阶级就是要向这“堡垒”冲锋！敬爱的毛主席啊，我们向您献上一颗忠心，刀山火海何所惧，风吹浪打跟着您学游泳。红太阳照亮了千山万水，工人阶级下定最大的决心，毛主席挥手指航程，我们永远前进！前进！
