The commune nurtures new people, and the mountain village has changed.

		Study activist of Mao Zedong Thought, poor peasant female commune member Xiaokui Rong

		Under the nurturing of the great Mao Zedong Thought, a new generation is growing in the people's commune.

		In the past, in places like our poor mountain valley, impoverished peasants were oppressed by the "three big mountains," unable to breathe. They had no food to eat, no clothes to wear, no education, and no rights as human beings.

		Now, things are completely different. Since the establishment of the people's commune, especially since the great "Four Cleanups" movement and the Cultural Revolution, the great Mao Zedong Thought has armed the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, and people's spiritual outlook has undergone profound changes.

		In the past, the nights in the mountain valley were dull and lifeless. Now, every evening after dinner, the Mao Zedong Thought study classes are brightly lit and bustling. The young men and women are the most active, and even the elderly are not lagging behind. Everyone opens Mao Zedong's sacred book and studies it word by word. Many elderly people, whose eyesight has deteriorated and memory has faded, rely on their sincere loyalty to Chairman Mao to learn Mao Zedong's brilliant works "Old Three Articles" and more than a dozen quotations.

		At one time, the commune's sheep had no grass to eat, and the cadres proposed at the commune members' meeting to exchange firewood with the commune members for sheep grass. The next morning, a pile of sheep grass was already stacked by the commune's sheep pen. A few days later, another large pile of sheep grass, weighing over two thousand pounds, was stacked by the sheep pen. Who brought it? When did they bring it? The cadres inquired for half a day but couldn't find a single person. Finally, they had to "order": There is enough sheep grass, no one should bring any more sheep grass to the brigade.

		In the past, the biggest worry for cadres was that some commune members would quarrel over work points, pick light work, and not care about quality. Now, the cadres are not worried about these things, but rather about how to persuade the commune members to pay attention to the combination of work and rest during the busy farming season. When the busy farming season arrives, the broad masses of commune members eagerly take on more work. The cadres, despite their patient persuasion, always receive this response: "We work, neither for more work points nor for more food. We are working to make Chairman Mao proud and to make the Cultural Revolution proud!"

    公社育新人　山村变了样
    学习毛泽东思想积极分子、贫农女社员　肖桂荣
    在伟大的毛泽东思想哺育下，人民公社里一代新人在成长。
    过去，在我们这样的穷山沟里，贫苦农民被“三座大山”压得喘不过气来，没有饭吃，没有衣穿，没有文化，没有一点做人的权利。
    如今，可大不相同了。自从人民公社化以后，特别是伟大的“四清”运动和无产阶级文化大革命以来，伟大的毛泽东思想武装了广大贫下中农的头脑，人们的精神面貌发生了深刻的变化。
    过去，山沟里的夜晚死气沉沉。如今，每天吃过晚饭，毛泽东思想学习班里灯火通明，热闹非凡。小伙子和姑娘们是最活跃的分子，老头老太太可也不落后。大家翻开毛主席的宝书，一字一句地学，许多老人眼睛花了，记性差了，就凭着他们对毛主席的赤胆忠心，学会了毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”和十几段语录。
    有一个时期，队里的羊没草吃了，干部们在社员会上提出，用山柴跟社员换羊草。第二天天刚亮，队里羊圈旁边就堆起了一堆羊草。过了几天，羊圈旁边又堆起了一大垛羊草，足有两千多斤。是谁送的？什么时候送的？干部们打听了半天，连个人影也没找着，最后不得不“下令”：羊草已经够用了，谁也不要再往大队送羊草了。
    早先，当干部最愁的事是，有些社员争工分，拣轻活，不顾质量。现在，当干部的不是再愁这些，而是愁农忙季节如何说服社员，注意劳逸结合。当农忙季节到来，广大社员争着多干活，干部们尽管耐心劝说，他们总是这样地回答：“我们干活，一不为多挣几个工分，二不为多分点粮食，我们是为毛主席争气，为无产阶级文化大革命争气！”
    山沟变了样，人的精神面貌变了样，一代新人在人民公社里成长！
