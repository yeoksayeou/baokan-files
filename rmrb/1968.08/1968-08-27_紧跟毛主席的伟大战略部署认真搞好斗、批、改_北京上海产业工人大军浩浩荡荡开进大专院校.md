The industrial workers of Beijing and Shanghai are marching into colleges and universities in a grand procession.

The worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams stationed in various schools have made significant contributions in promoting revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination. They are determined to carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the working class, fully implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions in colleges and universities, participate in the struggle, criticism, and reform, lead the educational revolution and all work in the schools, thoroughly change the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling the schools, and let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought forever fly high on the educational front.

Revolutionary Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and staff enthusiastically welcome the worker propaganda teams entering the schools. They expressed that they will, under the leadership of the working class, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary ideology of despising workers and peasants, quickly catch up with the magnificent strides of hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end.

	New China News Agency, August 26th: The working class of the capital, following the great teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, "to fully exert the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and all work," together with the PLA soldiers, formed dozens of worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, marching into the capital's various colleges and universities in a grand procession. They are determined to carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the working class, fully implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions in colleges and universities, participate in the struggle, criticism, and reform, lead the educational revolution and all work in the schools, thoroughly change the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling the schools, and let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought forever fly high on the educational front.

	The worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams entering colleges and universities is a great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, a great revolutionary innovation. In late July, a strong worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team from the capital first entered Tsinghua Garden, propagating and implementing Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, quickly achieving revolutionary great unity for the two factions that had been seriously opposed for a long time in Tsinghua University, and presenting a lively revolutionary scene throughout the school. This fully demonstrated the tremendous power of the new thing, the worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team. Subsequently, the working class of the capital formed dozens of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams and successively entered various colleges and universities in the capital. Wherever the worker propaganda teams went, they were enthusiastically welcomed by the revolutionary Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and staff. Many schools were filled with a joyous revolutionary atmosphere. In schools such as Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology, Central Institute for Nationalities, Central Institute of Finance and Banking, and Beijing Institute of Mechanical Engineering, the two factions that had been seriously opposed originally welcomed the propaganda teams with drums and gongs. Many schools held welcoming rallies for the two factions together. They said, welcoming comrades from the workers and the PLA to lead us, help us, and educate us. We are determined to quickly catch up with the magnificent strides of hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, and soldiers, implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	As soon as the worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams of the capital entered the schools, they enthusiastically and tirelessly propagated Mao Zedong Thought, helped teachers and students hold various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and quickly turned Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions into the conscious actions of the broad revolutionary teachers and staff. They strongly supported all new things in line with Mao Zedong Thought among revolutionary teachers and students, and firmly resisted and fought against erroneous words and deeds that went against Mao Zedong Thought. The worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed in Tsinghua University paid special attention to doing patient, in-depth, and detailed ideological work. They formed small teams to go deep into the dormitories and family areas of teachers and students, study Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions with the broad revolutionary teachers, students, and staff and their families, and have heart-to-heart talks. They focused on class education and carried out "bitter memories, sweet memories" activities. Many worker comrades, together with revolutionary teachers and students, used their personal experiences and the facts of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines in Tsinghua University, to denounce the heinous crimes of a small handful of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist-roaders, and untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in stirring up the masses to fight the masses, and severely criticize the reactionary theory of "multiple centers is no center." The broad revolutionary teachers and students were deeply educated and said excitedly: "The worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team of the capital is a vanguard in enthusiastically propagating Mao Zedong Thought, a model in closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and an exemplar in fully implementing Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions."

	The worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams stationed in various colleges and universities all paid special attention to giving full play to the role of workers within the schools. The revolutionary workers of Tsinghua University, with the enthusiastic help and guidance of the propaganda team, first achieved revolutionary great unity. Their revolutionary actions set an example for the broad teachers and students, greatly promoting the revolutionary great unity of the entire school. After the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team entered Peking University, the revolutionary workers also took the lead in achieving revolutionary great unity. Many colleges and universities' revolutionary workers learned from the revolutionary workers of Tsinghua University and vied to be promoters of revolutionary great unity and models in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

	The worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams stationed in various colleges and universities, following Chairman Mao's great teaching, "the working class should also continuously improve its political awareness in the struggle," in the process of propagating and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, grasped their own ideological revolutionization. A strong, revolutionary, and militarized propaganda team of the working class is taking shape in the struggle. The worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed in Tsinghua University, taking the PLA as an example, vigorously carried out the "Four Good" company and "Five Good" soldier activities, insisted on the four firsts, and carried forward the three-eight style. The propaganda teams stationed in Peking University, Beijing Institute of Mechanical Engineering, and other colleges and universities, workers and the PLA learned from each other and jointly improved, greatly promoting the ideological revolutionization of the propaganda teams.

	The worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams stationed in various schools have made significant contributions in promoting revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination in the schools. They will surely, in the future, in carrying out revolutionary great criticism, cleaning up the class ranks, and doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and reform and other work, in the struggle to thoroughly end the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools, fully exert the leading role of the working class. The worker comrades proudly declared: Chairman Mao is our backbone, and we must make Chairman Mao proud. We must hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought and fight shoulder to shoulder with the revolutionary Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and staff to turn the colleges and universities into red Mao Zedong Thought schools.

	New China News Agency, Shanghai, August 26th: According to the great strategic deployment of the great leader Chairman Mao, the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee decided to organize a large number of worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to enter the higher educational institutions in Shanghai, together with the revolutionary teachers and staff of these schools, seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and reform in the schools, and carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end. By the 26th, the worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams had already entered 23 higher educational institutions in Shanghai.

	The great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "Our country has 700 million people, and the working class is the leading class. We must fully exert the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and all work. The working class should also continuously improve its political awareness in the struggle." The more than one hundred thousand industrial workers in Shanghai, who have a glorious revolutionary fighting tradition and have made great contributions in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and were extremely excited and deeply moved. They enthusiastically responded to the battle call of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, under the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee, and organized worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to enter universities to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, help schools seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and reform. The workers excitedly said, Chairman Mao trusts us workers the most, and we must take on the heavy burden. Chairman Mao sent us into universities, into cultural units, into scientific research departments, and into all units that have not done a good job in the struggle, criticism, and reform. We will resolutely advance in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao! An old worker happily said: "For thousands of years, it has been 'those who toil in mind rule others, and those who toil in strength are ruled by others.' Chairman Mao sent us workers into universities, completely reversing the inverted history!" Many factories selected workers with rich experience in class struggle and production struggle, as well as workers who had fought bravely in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, to join the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams. Before entering the colleges and universities, these propaganda teams universally held Mao Zedong Thought study classes, seriously studying Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions on educational revolution and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	The Yangshupu Power Plant, with a glorious revolutionary fighting tradition, had 80 excellent workers join the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team. Old worker Jiang Lin-gen, who participated in the Shanghai workers' three armed uprisings more than 40 years ago, said, Chairman Mao issued a great call to the working class, and we workers do not go to seize the cultural power, who will seize it? Can we still let those bourgeois lords occupy the cultural power? Chairman Mao waves his hand, and we advance! We workers seize the cultural power to make the political power more solid and to ensure that the proletarian state of our country will never change color! With Chairman Mao's brilliant leadership and such a powerful working-class force, we will surely achieve victory in the educational revolution!

	The Shanghai Wujing Chemical Factory had more than 100 workers join the worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team. During the study, the workers discussed such issues: Our workers have low cultural levels, can we shoulder this heavy responsibility? The workers who joined the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team unanimously replied: Yes! Because we have the great leader Chairman Mao's support, we have the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and we have the strong support of all Shanghai workers! Since we can win battles in class struggle and production struggle, we are also fully capable of winning battles in this struggle to occupy the university battlefield and smash the bourgeois strongholds!

	Many workers who continued to stay in the factory to grasp the revolution and promote production expressed that they must take on the task of grasping the revolution and promoting production in the factory, with even more outstanding revolutionary and production achievements, support the work of the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, and respond to the great trust and ardent expectations of the great leader Chairman Mao for the working class.

	In recent days, the revolutionary teachers and staff of many higher educational institutions in Shanghai have been carrying out various activities to enthusiastically welcome the worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams into the schools. The revolutionary teachers and students of Tongji University specially performed programs, wrote poems, and made "supporting workers' covenants" to welcome the worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams into the school. The revolutionary Red Guards of the Fisheries Processing Department of Shanghai Fisheries College invited workers to jointly hold a criticism meeting, criticizing the crimes of the capitalist-roaders and reactionary academic "authorities" in the school who despised workers and peasants and sabotaged the revolutionary teachers and students' combination with workers and peasants. The revolutionary teachers and students of Shanghai Foreign Languages Institute, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai First Medical College, East China Normal University, Shanghai Fudan University, and other higher educational institutions expressed that after the worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams entered the school, they must, under the leadership of the working class, deeply carry out revolutionary great criticism, do a good job in cleaning up the class ranks, rectify the party organization, strengthen party building, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They also expressed that they must thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary ideology of despising workers and peasants, humbly learn from the workers as teachers, seriously accept the leadership of the working class, and resolutely follow the path indicated by Chairman Mao to combine with workers, peasants, and soldiers.

    工人毛泽东思想宣传队开进高等学校，这是毛主席的伟大战略部署，是伟大的革命创举。七月下旬，一支坚强的首都工人毛泽东思想宣传队首先开进清华园，宣传落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，使清华大学长期以来严重对立的两派迅速实现了革命大联合，全校呈现一派生气勃勃的革命景象，充分显示出工人毛泽东思想宣传队这一新生事物的无比威力。接着，首都工人阶级又组成了数十支毛泽东思想宣传队，陆续开进首都各大专院校。工人宣传队所到之处，受到广大革命的红卫兵和革命师生员工的热烈欢迎。许多学校里，充满了一片喜气洋洋的革命气氛。北京钢铁学院、中央民族学院、中央财政金融学院、北京机械学院等一些院校，原来严重对立的两派群众，在一起敲锣打鼓，热情欢迎宣传队。不少院校两派群众一起召开了欢迎大会。他们说，欢迎工人同志和解放军同志来领导我们，帮助我们，教育我们。我们决心迅速跟上亿万工农兵群众的雄伟步伐，落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    首都工人毛泽东思想宣传队一进学校就热情地不辞辛苦地宣传毛泽东思想，帮助师生举办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，让毛主席的一系列最新指示迅速化为广大革命师生员工的自觉行动。他们对于革命师生中一切符合毛泽东思想的新生事物都给予大力支持，对于那些违背毛泽东思想的错误言行则坚决抵制和斗争。驻清华大学的首都工人毛泽东思想宣传队十分注意做耐心的、深入细致的思想工作，他们组成小分队，深入师生宿舍和家属区，同广大革命师生员工和家属一起学习毛主席的一系列最新指示，促膝谈心。他们大抓阶级教育，开展忆苦思甜活动。许多工人同志还以切身的体验以及清华大学的阶级斗争、两条路线斗争事实，和革命师生员工一起控诉以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的一小撮叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派，以及没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子挑动群众斗群众的滔天罪行，狠批反动的“多中心即无中心论”。广大革命师生员工深受教育，他们激动地说：“首都工人毛泽东思想宣传队是热情宣传毛泽东思想的先锋，是紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署的模范，是全面落实毛主席一系列最新指示的表率。”
    进驻各院校的工人毛泽东思想宣传队都十分注意发挥学校内的工人的作用。清华大学的革命工人，在宣传队的热情帮助和指导下，首先实现了革命大联合。他们的革命行动为广大师生树立了榜样，大大推动了全校的革命大联合。北京大学的革命工人在毛泽东思想宣传队进校后，也首先带头实现了革命大联合。许多大专院校的革命工人纷纷向清华大学的革命工人学习，争当革命大联合的促进派和落实毛主席最新指示的模范。
    驻各大专院校的工人毛泽东思想宣传队，遵循毛主席“工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟”的伟大教导，在宣传落实毛主席最新指示的过程中，狠抓自身的思想革命化。一支坚强的革命化的战斗化的工人阶级的宣传队伍正在斗争中形成。驻清华大学的首都工人毛泽东思想宣传队，以解放军为榜样，大力开展“四好连队”、“五好战士”活动，坚持四个第一，发扬三八作风。驻北京大学、北京机械学院等大专院校的宣传队，工人和解放军互相学习，共同提高，大大促进了宣传队的思想革命化。
    驻各校的工人毛泽东思想宣传队，已经在促进各学校的革命大联合和革命三结合方面作出了重大贡献。他们今后还必将在开展革命大批判，清理阶级队伍，搞好斗、批、改等各项工作中，在彻底结束资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象的斗争中，充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用。工人同志们豪迈地表示：毛主席为我们撑腰，我们一定给毛主席争气。我们一定更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，和革命的红卫兵、革命师生员工并肩战斗，把大专院校办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    新华社上海二十六日电　根据伟大领袖毛主席的伟大战略部署，上海市革命委员会决定组织大批工人毛泽东思想宣传队进入上海的高等学校，同这些学校的革命师生员工一起，认真搞好学校的斗、批、改，把无产阶级教育革命进行到底。到二十六日止，工人毛泽东思想宣传队已经进入上海二十三所高等学校。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近指出：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”具有光荣革命斗争传统的、在无产阶级文化大革命中立下了巨大功勋的上海一百几十万产业工人，学习了毛主席的这一最新指示，无比兴奋，万分激动。他们热烈响应以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的战斗号令，在上海市革命委员会的领导下，纷纷组织工人毛泽东思想宣传队进入大学宣传毛泽东思想，帮助学校认真搞好斗、批、改。工人们激动地说，毛主席最信任我们工人阶级，我们就要把千斤重担挑起来。毛主席派我们进大学，进文艺单位，进科学研究部门，进一切没有搞好斗、批、改的单位，我们坚决沿着毛主席指引的方向奋勇前进。一位老工人高兴地说：“几千年来都是‘劳心者治人，劳力者治于人’，毛主席派我们工人进大学，把被颠倒的历史彻底颠倒过来了！”许多工厂挑选了具有丰富的阶级斗争和生产斗争经验的老工人，以及在文化大革命中冲锋陷阵、英勇斗争的工人，参加了毛泽东思想宣传队。在进入大专院校以前，这些宣传队普遍举办了毛泽东思想学习班，认真学习毛主席关于教育革命和无产阶级文化大革命的一系列最新指示。
    具有光荣革命斗争传统的杨树浦发电厂，有八十名优秀的工人参加了毛泽东思想宣传队。老工人姜林根，四十多年前曾参加过上海工人三次武装起义。他说，毛主席向我们工人阶级发出了伟大号召，我们工人阶级不去掌握文权谁来掌握文权？难道还能让那些资产阶级老爷们霸占文权吗？毛主席挥手我前进！我们工人掌握了文权才能使政权更巩固，才能保证我国无产阶级江山永不变色！我们有毛主席的英明领导，有这样强大的工人阶级队伍，我们一定能够取得教育革命的胜利！
    上海吴泾化工厂有一百多名工人参加了工人毛泽东思想宣传队。在学习中，工人们议论到这样的问题：我们工人文化水平低，能不能肩负这一重任？参加毛泽东思想宣传队的工人们齐声回答说：能！因为我们有伟大领袖毛主席撑腰，我们有战无不胜的毛泽东思想，我们有全上海工人的有力支持！我们既然能够在阶级斗争和生产斗争中打胜仗，也完全有能力在这场占领大学阵地，摧毁资产阶级顽固堡垒的战斗中打胜仗！
    许多继续留在工厂抓革命促生产岗位上的工人纷纷表示，一定要把厂里抓革命促生产的任务顶下来，以更加出色的革命和生产成绩，支持毛泽东思想宣传队做好工作，回答伟大领袖毛主席对工人阶级的最大信任和殷切期望。
    上海许多高等学校的革命师生员工这几天正展开各种活动，热烈欢迎工人毛泽东思想宣传队进校。同济大学的革命师生专门排演节目，写诗歌，订“拥工公约”，欢迎工人毛泽东思想宣传队进校。上海水产学院水产加工系革命的红卫兵小将邀请工人一道举行批判会，批判学校里的走资派和反动学术“权威”轻视工农，破坏革命师生和工农相结合的罪行。上海外国语学院、上海师范学院、上海第一医学院、华东师范大学、上海复旦大学等高等学校的革命师生表示，工人毛泽东思想宣传队进校后，一定要在工人阶级的领导下，深入开展革命的大批判，搞好清理阶级队伍的工作，整顿党的组织，加强党的建设，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。他们还表示，要彻底批判轻视工农的资产阶级反动思想，虚心拜工人为师，认真接受工人阶级的领导，坚决走毛主席指引的同工农兵相结合的道路。
