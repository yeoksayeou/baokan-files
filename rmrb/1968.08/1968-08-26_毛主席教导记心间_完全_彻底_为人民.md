Song Yulan, the women's team leader of the Sixth Production Team in Xingshou Brigade, Xingshou Commune, saw that the irrigation canal of the Ninth Production Team had burst. The white water was gushing out through the breach. She thought, in this severe drought, water is truly a treasure, and it must not be allowed to flow away. The breach must be plugged immediately. However, she had nothing in her hands to plug the gap. She thought of Chairman Mao's teachings on "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people and jumped into the water to use her body to plug the breach. She persisted for over an hour until someone came to repair the breach, and then she happily returned home. When the members of the Ninth Production Team praised her, she replied, "Heroes listen to Chairman Mao's words and use their bodies to protect the lives of twenty-seven class brothers. I only plugged a breach, it's nothing. It was Chairman Mao who told me to do this."

    毛主席教导记心间
    “完全”“彻底”为人民
    兴寿公社兴寿大队六队妇女队长宋玉兰，看见九队的水渠决口了，白花花的水，冲着口子往外流。她想，这大旱天，水可真是个宝呵，决不能让它流跑，得赶快把口子堵起来。但是，她空着两只手，怎么能堵住缺口呢？她想到毛主席“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的教导，就跳下水去，用身子堵住缺口，坚持了一个多小时，直到有人来把口子堵好，她才愉快地回家。当九队的社员表扬她时，她回答说：“英雄门合听毛主席的话，用身体保护了二十七个阶级兄弟的生命，我只是堵了一个缺口，算不了啥，是毛主席叫我这样做的。”
