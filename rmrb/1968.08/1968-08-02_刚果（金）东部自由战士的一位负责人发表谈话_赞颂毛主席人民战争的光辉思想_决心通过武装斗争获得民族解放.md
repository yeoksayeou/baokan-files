A leader of the free fighters in eastern Congo (Kinshasa) spoke to a Xinhua News Agency reporter on the eve of the 41st anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, highly praising Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on people's war. He expressed the determination of the Congolese (Kinshasa) people to achieve national liberation through armed struggle.

The Congolese (Kinshasa) free fighter leader, who is currently engaged in fierce struggle against U.S. imperialism and its lackey Mobutu, first extended fraternal and united greetings to the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army. He stressed that Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people, formulated and highly developed the principles of people's war through revolutionary practice. He said, "The history of the Chinese People's Liberation Army not only inspires the people of various countries who are fighting for liberation, but is also of great importance for these countries' people to learn from and apply the principles of people's war according to their own national characteristics."

He said, the Congolese (Kinshasa) free fighters have learned from and applied the Three Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, raising their political consciousness and gaining the sympathy of the broad rural masses. He said, almost all Congolese (Kinshasa) free fighters remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "The people's army and the people are as close as fish and water."

When talking about the armed struggle of the Congolese (Kinshasa) people, he said, "Despite the brutal suppression carried out by the fascist military regime of Mobutu in the past two years, the people's unshakable will and determination to gain liberation are certainly unconquerable by any force."

He said, "The Congolese (Kinshasa) people have learned from their temporary setbacks and stood up again." He said, since last June, the rebuilt revolutionary patriotic forces have been fighting with the pseudo-army in eastern Congo (Kinshasa). The U.S. imperialists and their puppet regime of Mobutu thought they had suppressed the people's war, but the Congolese (Kinshasa) revolutionary people shattered their illusions. This once again proves that Chairman Mao's judgment is the truth: "What is the real iron wall? It is the masses, the thousands and tens of thousands of people who truly support the revolution. 'The reactionaries cannot destroy us, but we will destroy the reactionaries.'"

He went on to say, the armed Congolese (Kinshasa) revolutionary people have also fought against those who advocate that economic reforms can be achieved without armed struggle, the "reconciliationists." He emphasized, "With the bitter experiences of the past few years, we will not be deceived again."

The leader of the free fighters in eastern Congo (Kinshasa) also condemned the modern revisionists who develop diplomatic, cultural, and economic relations with those who massacre the Congolese (Kinshasa) people. He said, "They provide sticks to the U.S. imperialists and their puppet Mobutu who are heading towards death."

He finally expressed, "The Congolese people will forever remain vigilant, consciously adhere to revolutionary principles, ignite the flames of people's war, and persist in the struggle until they achieve final and complete victory."

　　刚果（金）东部自由战士的一位负责人发表谈话
　　赞颂毛主席人民战争的光辉思想
　　决心通过武装斗争获得民族解放
    新华社一日讯　刚果（金）东部自由战士的一位负责人在中国人民解放军建军四十一周年前夕向新华社记者发表谈话，高度赞扬毛主席关于人民战争的光辉思想，并表示刚果（金）人民决心通过武装斗争来取得民族解放。
    正在同美帝国主义及其走狗蒙博托进行激烈斗争的这位刚果（金）自由战士负责人，首先向英雄的中国人民解放军致以兄弟和团结的敬礼。他强调指出，中国人民伟大领袖毛泽东主席通过革命实践，制定和高度发展了人民战争的原则。他说：“中国人民解放军过去的历史不仅鼓舞着正在为争取解放而进行革命斗争的各国人民，而且对于这些国家的人民根据自己的民族特点学习和运用人民战争的原则是十分重要的。”
    他说，刚果（金）自由战士学习和运用中国人民解放军的三大纪律八项注意，提高了自己的政治觉悟，得到农村广大群众的同情。他说，差不多所有的刚果（金）自由战士心里都记得毛主席的教导：人民军队同人民是鱼水不能分离的。
    这位负责人谈到刚果（金）人民的武装斗争时说：“尽管蒙博托法西斯军事政权过去两年多来实行了残酷的镇压，人民要获得解放的不可摧毁的意志和决心，肯定是任何力量也征服不了的。”
    他说：“刚果（金）人民从他们经受的暂时的挫折中汲取了教训，站起来了。”他说，从去年六月起，重建的革命爱国力量同伪军在刚果（金）东部一直在战斗。美帝及其走狗蒙博托傀儡政权以为，他们已经把人民战争镇压下去了，但是，刚果（金）革命人民粉碎了他们的这种美梦。这再次证明，毛主席的论断是真理：“真正的铜墙铁壁是什么？是群众，是千百万真心实意地拥护革命的群众。”“反革命打不破我们，我们却要打破反革命。”
    他接着说，武装起来的刚果（金）革命人民还同那些鼓吹不经过武装斗争也能实现经济改革的“和解派”进行了斗争。他强调指出：“有了过去几年深刻的惨痛的经验，我们决不再受骗了。”
    这位刚果（金）东部自由战士的负责人还谴责现代修正主义者竟同屠杀刚果（金）人民的人发展外交、文化和经济关系。他说：“他们在美帝及其傀儡蒙博托正在走向死亡的时候，向他们提供棍棒。”
    他最后表示：“刚果人民将永远保持警惕，自觉地坚持革命原则，点燃人民战争的烈火，坚持斗争，直到赢得最后的彻底的胜利。”
