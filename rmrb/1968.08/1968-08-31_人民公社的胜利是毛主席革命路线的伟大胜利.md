Millions of soldiers and civilians across the country enthusiastically celebrate the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the people's communes. The victory of the people's communes is a great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants expressed their determination to unite more closely around the Proletarian Headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, to resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and to strive to make the people's communes into red-hot schools of Mao Zedong Thought.

New China News Agency, August 30th: In the great situation where the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is rapidly advancing towards the goal of comprehensive victory, millions of revolutionary masses, revolutionary cadres, and soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army across the country enthusiastically celebrate the tenth anniversary of the issuance of Chairman Mao's great instruction "The People's Commune is good" and the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Issue of Establishing People's Communes in the Countryside." They enthusiastically acclaim the brilliant achievements made in all aspects over the ten years since the establishment of the people's communes, and enthusiastically acclaim the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants expressed their determination to unite more closely around the Proletarian Headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, to resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and to strive to make the people's communes into red-hot schools of Mao Zedong Thought.

To celebrate the tenth anniversary of the issuance of Chairman Mao's great instruction "The People's Commune is good" and the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Issue of Establishing People's Communes in the Countryside," millions of soldiers and civilians across the country, with deep proletarian feelings of loyalty to Chairman Mao, have extensively carried out various celebrations. Over the past ten years, regions in Henan, Shandong, Anhui, Beijing, Tianjin, and other provinces and cities that Chairman Mao inspected, as well as Guangdong and Guizhou provinces, have held celebrations with tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of participants. Military and civilian personnel in Shanxi, Hebei, Inner Mongolia, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangxi, Hubei, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Shanghai provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have also held meetings, discussions, and exhibitions to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the people's communes. Many workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and soldiers of the Liberation Army have also performed celebratory programs.

During the celebrations, the broad masses of soldiers and civilians reviewed the battle history of this new thing, the people's communes, growing and thriving under the personal care of the great leader Chairman Mao, and enthusiastically discussed the earth-shaking changes that have taken place in China's countryside over the past ten years on the road of communalization. Broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres excitedly pointed out: These ten years have been a decade of the people's communes growing and thriving in the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, continuously strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the socialist stronghold in the countryside becoming increasingly consolidated and developed; these ten years have been a decade of the collective economy of the people's communes thriving and advancing, and the broad countryside rapidly changing its face of poverty and backwardness; these ten years have been a decade of the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres undergoing severe tests of class struggle, with their socialist consciousness greatly enhanced, and new people and new things emerging in large numbers. When discussing these series of changes, the military and civilian personnel in various places pointed out: The victories achieved by the people's communes in all aspects over the past ten years are, in the final analysis, the great victories of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

While celebrating the great victories of the people's communes over the past ten years, the military and civilian personnel in various places further launched a fierce exposure and criticism of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in various places. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai Commune in Xiyang County, Shanxi Province, and Qiliping Commune in Xinxiang County, Henan Province, angrily pointed out: The Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in various places frantically opposed the people's communes, shouting that the people's communes were "established too early" and "established poorly," and that the superiority of the people's communes was "not so obvious," which were all utter lies. We poor and lower-middle peasants deeply feel from our personal experiences that the superiority of the people's communes is great, the people's communes are indeed established correctly and well, and they are very good! Many poor and lower-middle peasants and soldiers of the Liberation Army in Jiangsu, Guangdong, Beijing, and other provinces and municipalities said: The Chinese Khrushchev and his ilk vigorously advocated "three freedoms and one contract" and "material incentives," which are thoroughly revisionist black goods, and spread the extremely reactionary theory of "the extinction of class struggle" everywhere. Their evil purpose is to destroy the people's communes personally cultivated by Chairman Mao, to restore capitalism in the countryside, and to make us poor and lower-middle peasants retrace our steps and suffer again. However, our personal experiences have made us deeply understand that what Chairman Mao pointed out early on, "Only socialism can save China," is a great truth. The plot of the Chinese Khrushchev and his ilk to restore capitalism will never succeed!

The people's communes, this new social organization with great vitality, have grown and thrived after ten years of severe tests of class struggle, especially after the great storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and are now shining more and more brightly with the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Chinese Khrushchev and other handful of top capitalist-roaders within the Party, as well as their agents in various places, were exposed, and their crimes of attempting to restore capitalism in the countryside were criticized. The class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and commune members has been greatly enhanced, the people's communes have been further consolidated, and the socialist collective economy has achieved tremendous development. On this joyous day of celebrating the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the people's communes, the country from south to north and from east to west is resounding with the cheers of "The people's communes are good!" "The people's communes are indeed good!" "The people's communes are very good!" "Long live the people's communes!" Hundreds of millions of soldiers and civilians are determined to hold high the red flag of "The people's communes are good" personally raised by Chairman Mao, and let it forever fly over the land of our motherland.

Reviewing the ten-year battle history, the broad masses of soldiers and civilians deeply feel: Following Chairman Mao is victory! At present, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country is rapidly advancing towards the great goal of comprehensive victory, and the overall situation is unprecedentedly good and getting better and better. The military and civilian personnel in various places are determined to advance victoriously in this good situation, to unite more closely around the Proletarian Headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, to carry out Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, to give full play to the leading role of the working class, to seize the opportunity to do a good job in struggle, criticism, and transformation, to achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and to make the people's communes even better.

    各地亿万军民热烈庆祝人民公社建立十周年
    人民公社的胜利是毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利
    广大贫下中农表示要更紧密地团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部周围，坚决贯彻执行毛主席一系列最新指示，为把文化大革命进行到底，把人民公社办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校而奋勇前进
    新华社三十日讯　全国各地亿万革命群众、革命干部和人民解放军指战员，在无产阶级文化大革命迅猛地向全面胜利伟大目标迈进的大好形势下，热烈庆祝毛主席“人民公社好”伟大指示和《中共中央关于在农村建立人民公社问题的决议》发表十周年，热烈欢呼人民公社建立十年来在各方面取得的辉煌成就，热烈欢呼毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。广大贫下中农表示要更紧密地团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部周围，坚决贯彻执行毛主席一系列的最新指示，为把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把人民公社办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校而奋勇前进。
    为庆祝毛主席“人民公社好”伟大指示和《中共中央关于在农村建立人民公社问题的决议》发表十周年，连日来，各地亿万军民怀着无限忠于毛主席的深厚的无产阶级感情，广泛地开展了各种各样的庆祝活动。十年前毛主席视察过的河南、山东、安徽、北京、天津等省、市的一些地区，以及广东、贵州等省，分别召开了有几万人到几十万人参加的庆祝大会。山西、河北、内蒙古、江苏、浙江、广西、湖北、吉林、黑龙江、辽宁、陕西、甘肃、上海等省、市、自治区的军民，也分别举行集会、座谈和举办展览等，庆祝人民公社建立十周年。许多工人、贫下中农和解放军战士，还演出了庆祝节目。
    各地广大军民在庆祝活动中，回顾了人民公社这个新生事物在伟大领袖毛主席的亲自抚育下胜利成长的战斗历程，畅谈了十年来我国农村在人民公社化的道路上发生的翻天覆地的变化。广大贫下中农和革命干部激动地指出：这十年，是人民公社在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争中胜利成长，使无产阶级专政不断地得到加强，农村社会主义阵地日益巩固和发展的十年；这十年，是人民公社集体经济蓬勃向前发展，广大农村迅速改变“一穷二白”面貌的十年；这十年，是广大革命群众和革命干部经过激烈的阶级斗争的严峻考验，社会主义觉悟大大提高，新人新事大量涌现的十年。各地军民在谈到这一系列变化时指出：十年来人民公社在各个方面所取得的一切胜利，归根到底，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。
    各地军民在欢呼人民公社十年来的伟大胜利的时候，进一步对中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮最大的走资派和他们在各地的代理人，展开了猛烈的揭发和批判。山西省昔阳县大寨公社和河南省新乡县七里营公社的贫下中农愤怒地指出：中国赫鲁晓夫及其在各地的代理人疯狂地反对人民公社，大叫人民公社“办早了”、“办糟了”，人民公社“优越性还不那么明显”，完全是颠倒黑白的胡言乱语。我们贫下中农从亲身经历中深深地感到，人民公社的优越性大得很，人民公社就是办得对，办得好，好得很！江苏、广东、北京等省、市的许多贫下中农和解放军战士说，中国赫鲁晓夫之流竭力鼓吹“三自一包”、“物质刺激”等彻头彻尾的修正主义黑货，到处贩卖反动透顶的“阶级斗争熄灭”论，其罪恶目的，就是要搞垮毛主席亲自培育的人民公社，在农村复辟资本主义，要我们贫下中农走回头路，吃二遍苦。但是，切身的经历使我们深深地懂得，毛主席早就指出的“只有社会主义能够救中国”是伟大的真理，中国赫鲁晓夫之流复辟资本主义的阴谋，是绝对不能得逞的，永远不会得逞的！湖北、河北、上海等省、市的许多贫下中农激动地说，毛主席指引的人民公社化的道路，是一条加速社会主义建设的道路，一条通向共产主义的道路，这条道路我们走定了！谁妄图阻挡我们走这条路，我们就奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，把他打翻在地，让他永世不得翻身！
    人民公社这个具有伟大生命力的崭新的社会组织，经过十年来阶级斗争的严峻考验，特别是经过这场伟大的无产阶级文化大革命风暴的考验，已经茁壮地成长起来，正越来越强烈地闪烁着毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉。在无产阶级文化大革命中，揪出了中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮最大的走资本主义道路当权派以及他们在各地的代理人，批判了他们妄图在农村复辟资本主义的罪行，广大贫下中农和社员群众阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟大大提高，人民公社进一步巩固，社会主义集体经济获得巨大发展。在庆祝人民公社建立十周年的大喜的日子里，祖国南北东西，到处响彻着“人民公社好！”“人民公社就是好！”“人民公社好得很！”“人民公社万岁！”的欢呼声。亿万军民决心更高地举起毛主席亲自树立的“人民公社好”的红旗，让它在祖国大地上永远飘扬。
    回顾十年的战斗历程，各地广大军民深深地感到：紧跟毛主席就是胜利！当前，在毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，我国无产阶级文化大革命正迅猛地向着全面胜利的伟大目标迈进，整个形势空前大好，而且越来越好。各地军民决心在大好形势下乘胜前进，更紧密地团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的周围，贯彻执行毛主席一系列最新指示，充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用，不失时机地搞好斗、批、改，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，把人民公社办得更好。
