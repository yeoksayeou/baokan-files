The pine trees of the Himalayas are cheering, and the rapids of the Yarlung Zangbo River are surging.

On August 11, 1968, I saw the red sun in the hearts of all revolutionary people around the world, our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao. This is the most unforgettable moment of my life, my greatest happiness, and my greatest honor! I saw with my own eyes Chairman Mao, his face glowing with health, full of vigor, extremely energetic, and in excellent health. I was extremely moved and greatly inspired, with tears of boundless joy, waving the Little Red Book, shouting over and over again: Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years to Chairman Mao!

We border guards think of Chairman Mao day and night! From the march into Tibet to the suppression of rebellions, to democratic reforms, from guarding the border to the self-defense counterattack on the Sino-Indian border, in the entire 18 years of hard and glorious struggle, we stood on the snow-capped mountains facing Beijing in the morning and looked at the bright North Star at night, thinking of him day and night, yearning to see Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao is always in the hearts of the border guards. Today, the long-awaited moment of greatest happiness has finally arrived, and the best wish has finally come true! Our countless words condense into a heartfelt sentence from the border guards, and countless songs compose a song from the hearts of the border guards: "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!"

The ice rivers flow into the sea, and the snow lotuses bloom towards the sun. We border guards have only one resolute determination and one lofty vow: to take Comrade Lin Biao as our shining example, forever loyal to the great helmsman Chairman Mao.

Over the past few decades of revolutionary struggle and the past two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have deeply understood: the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Comrade Lin Biao is the sole leadership center for the entire Party, the entire army, the entire nation, and all revolutionary masses. At every crucial moment of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao has issued new battle orders to us, pointing out the direction forward. We resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's instructions and can achieve one victory after another; we follow the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and have a direction, have strength.

At this critical moment when the hundreds of millions of revolutionary people across the country are closely united around the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao to seize a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, some people are advocating "multiple centers," attempting to undermine the core leadership of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao. The "multiple centers" theory is a reactionary theory of bourgeois factionalism and individualism, which disperses the unity of the revolutionary ranks based on Mao Zedong Thought and hinders the implementation of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We, the People's Liberation Army, are the people's army created and personally led by Chairman Mao, and personally commanded by Comrade Lin Biao, the pillar of the proletarian dictatorship. Defending the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Comrade Lin Biao is our most sacred duty and highest combat mission. We are determined, like the heroic martyr Xiao Ming, to defend the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Comrade Lin Biao with our blood and lives! We will learn from the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams in the capital, forever loyal to the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Comrade Lin Biao, unyielding even if the heavens collapse and the earth shatters!

　　毛主席，边防战士永远忠于您！
　　西藏部队战斗英雄肖明生生前所在部队某部副政委　周传忠
    喜马拉雅山的松涛在欢呼，雅鲁藏布江的激流在奔腾。
    一九六八年八月十一日，我见到了全世界革命人民心中最红最红的红太阳、我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，这是我终生最最难忘的时刻，是我最大最大的幸福，最大最大的光荣！我亲眼看到毛主席他老人家满面红光，神采奕奕，精力非常非常充沛，身体非常非常健康。我万分激动，无比振奋，含着无限幸福的喜泪，挥动宝书，千遍万遍地纵情欢呼：毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！
    我们边防战士日夜想念毛主席！从进军西藏到平叛、到民主改革，从驻守边防到中印边境自卫反击作战，在整整十八年的艰苦而光荣的岁月里，我们晨立雪山望北京，夜看明亮的北斗星，日日想，夜夜盼哪，日夜渴望见到毛主席。毛主席永远和边防战士心连心。今天，盼望已久的最最幸福的时刻终于到来了，最最美好的心愿终于实现了！我们千言万语凝成一句边防战士最贴心的话，千歌万曲谱出一支边防战士心中的歌：“敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”
    条条冰川归大海，朵朵雪莲向阳开。我们边防战士只有一颗最坚强的决心，最崇高的誓愿：以林副主席为光辉榜样，永远忠于伟大统帅毛主席。
    几十年来的革命斗争和两年来无产阶级文化大革命的斗争实践，使我们深深地懂得：以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，是全党、全军、全国和广大革命群众唯一的领导中心。在无产阶级文化大革命中的每一个关键时刻，以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部都向我们发出新的战斗号令，给我们指出前进的方向。我们坚决执行毛主席的指示，就能取得一个又一个胜利；紧跟毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，就有方向，就有力量。
    当前，正当全国亿万革命群众紧紧团结在以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部周围，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的关键时刻，有的人搞“多中心论”，妄图破坏以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的核心领导。“多中心论”是一种资产阶级山头主义、个人主义的反动理论，它涣散革命队伍在毛泽东思想基础上的团结，妨碍毛主席无产阶级革命路线的贯彻执行。我们人民解放军是毛主席亲手缔造、亲自领导，林副主席亲自指挥的人民军队，是无产阶级专政的柱石。保卫以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，是我们最神圣的职责，最高的战斗任务。我们决心象战斗英雄肖明生烈士那样，用鲜血和生命保卫以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部！我们要向首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队学习，永远忠于以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，天崩地裂不变心！
