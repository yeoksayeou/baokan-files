On the joyous occasion of the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the people's commune, as we reflect on the ten years that our Xipu Production Brigade has traveled on the road to the people's commune, we are filled with passion and shout aloud: "The people's commune is great! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

The people's commune is a new social and economic organization that shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. It is a bridge to the communist society and the lifeline of our broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. However, China's Khrushchev and his agents harbor deep hatred for the people's commune. They eat the fine rice and white flour produced by the labor of the commune members, yet maliciously attack the people's commune, saying it is a "mess," and slander the socialist new countryside as "pitch-black." This is nothing but a smear on socialism and a summoning of the spirits of capitalism. Today, I want to present the enormous changes in our Xipu Production Brigade over the past ten years and use ironclad facts to expose their lies.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Only socialism can save China." The people of Xipu have the most personal experience of this. Our village was once famous for its poverty. A folk song described our miserable past: "Eat vegetables in the morning, swallow chaff at noon, and have thin gruel for dinner by the moonlight." After liberation, our "poor sticks" in Xipu rose from the sea of suffering, but due to the scattered and backward small peasant economy, we could not withstand natural disasters and human calamities, and there was severe polarization. In the winter of 1952, we responded to Chairman Mao's great call and established the "Poor Sticks Cooperative." The landlords and rich peasants in the village ridiculed us, saying, "Poor sticks together, sooner or later they will scatter in poverty." We were poor but not in spirit. Following Chairman Mao's teachings, we fought against the class enemies and natural disasters, and our collective economy became increasingly solid. During the high tide of the agricultural cooperativization movement, the great leader Chairman Mao praised our Poor Sticks Cooperative as "the image of our entire country."

As production developed, we increasingly felt that such a small collective in one village could not meet the needs of production development. Just at this time, our great leader Chairman Mao issued the great call to "establish people's communes." This truly struck the hearts of our broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. In September 1958, our entire village, with drums and gongs, joined the people's commune.

The members of the Xipu Production Brigade, together with the 500 million farmers across the country, have marched forward for a full ten years on the broad road of the people's commune. These ten years have been a decade of earth-shaking changes for the Xipu Production Brigade. In the past, Xipu had many mountains and little land, much sand and thin soil, with an average yield of only about 100 jin per mu. The establishment of the commune opened up a broad path for the development of productive forces. Over the past ten years, under the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought, we have continued to carry forward the "Poor Sticks Spirit," relying on collective strength to improve the soil and build water conservancy projects. We built a water pumping station to lift water to mountains over 40 meters high; we constructed a 16-li-long mountain-ring canal to irrigate fields with water from the "Jianming Lake"; we transformed over 300 mu of long-term low-yield "waterlogged land" into high-yield fields, and turned over 100 mu of slopes into high-yield and stable "Dazhai Fields." The commune members planted trees and built terraces, turning barren mountains into green forests, terraced fields, and orchards. Agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline production all developed extensively. The grain yield per mu increased more than eightfold compared to the early days of cooperativization; large livestock increased from three donkeys at the time of the commune's establishment to 108 head, and we purchased rubber-wheeled carts, as well as tractors, weeding machines, crushing machines, rice hulling machines, water pumps, and a large number of other mechanical equipment and new agricultural tools. Seeing the enormous changes brought by the people's commune over these ten years, the poor and lower-middle peasants all excitedly said: "In the past, there were three donkey legs, people carried shoulder poles and pulled plows; now there are herds of horses and mules, rubber-wheeled carts, water pumps, and tractors."

The ten years of the people's commune have been ten years of struggle. The struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines has never ceased in the Xipu Production Brigade. Even when the people's commune was just being established, the class enemies tried every means to sabotage it. They incited the masses to demand that the public accumulation of the advanced cooperative be divided and eaten up, joining the commune with nothing but bare sticks. The Party branch promptly mobilized the poor and lower-middle peasants to expose the class enemies' plots. They said, "Our Poor Sticks Cooperative is the one praised by Chairman Mao. If we divide the public accumulation, it would be like dismantling the stage of socialism. We poor and lower-middle peasants must strive for Chairman Mao and absolutely cannot fall for the class enemies' tricks!" On September 6, 1958, when the Jianming People's Commune was born, we contributed all of our accumulation of over 400,000 yuan to the commune.

The birth of the people's commune brought the collectivization cause in our country to a new stage, which was a fatal blow to those who dreamed of restoring capitalism. They sought every opportunity to sabotage it. In the winter of 1959, while the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Xipu were further carrying forward the spirit of self-reliance and striving for progress to build their own gardens, China's Khrushchev and his agents in Hebei Province were pushing "material incentives" in our brigade, saying, "To quickly achieve mechanization, electrification, water conservation, and fertilization for the Jianming Commune, you can have as much money as you need." The poor and lower-middle peasants, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, immediately saw through their tricks and angrily said: "We cannot forget Chairman Mao's teaching of 'thrift in running the commune,' and we absolutely cannot rely on the state." The class enemies in Xipu, however, sang a different tune among the masses, saying: "Not eating meat that is put in your mouth, Wang Guofan's elbow is turned outward." But the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Xipu insisted on the "Poor Sticks Spirit" of thrift in running the commune, did not use state funds, and only used part of the public accumulation to carry out some basic agricultural construction. We relied on collective strength to resist the class enemies' economic corruption and insisted on the socialist direction.

During the three years of economic difficulties, China's Khrushchev and his agents blew the "three autonomies and one contract" black wind. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Xipu, under the leadership of the Party branch, went through bitter-sweet class education and resolutely resisted this capitalist reverse current. At that time, provincial and county cadres came to Xipu and proposed: "You are the red flag, and contract production to households should also be in the forefront," and let everyone discuss it. Many old poor peasants immediately refuted, saying: "At the time of liberation, every family also had land, but soon, weren't the rich still rich and the poor still poor? To divide the land and go it alone, isn't this to make us go back to the old ways and suffer a second round of hardship?..." The discussion meeting turned into a criticism meeting. Many poor and lower-middle peasants sharpened their eyes, raised their political awareness, and handed over the allocated private plots and small reclamations to the collective, making the commune even more solid.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, China's Khrushchev and his agents gathered the ghosts and snakes of society, attempting to seize power and change the heavens. With the strong help of the PLA Propaganda Team for Mao Zedong Thought, we carried out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism, repeatedly repelling the class enemies' counterattacks and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat.

After the baptism of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the spiritual face of the people of Xipu was completely renewed. Various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes sprang up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, and the flames of revolutionary criticism burned more fiercely. From the over-80-year-old elders to the young children who had just begun to understand things, everyone was striving to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, everyone was concerned about state affairs, everyone was criticizing the bourgeoisie, and everyone was concerned about the consolidation and development of the collective economy, insisting on the socialist direction. The spirit of farming for revolution was greatly carried forward. Selfless dedication and love for the collective were endless.

The poor and lower-middle peasants of the Xipu Production Brigade have deeply felt from ten years of practice that the people's commune is great! The people's commune is the lifeline of us poor and lower-middle peasants, and we poor and lower-middle peasants are the pillars of the people's commune. The bright socialist road pointed out by the great leader Chairman Mao, we poor and lower-middle peasants have determined to follow it.

    战斗的十年
    全国劳动模范、河北省遵化县西铺大队负责人　王国藩
    在人民公社成立十周年的喜庆的日子里，回顾我们西铺大队在人民公社化道路上走过的十年，我们满怀激情地放声高呼：“人民公社就是好！毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    人民公社是闪烁着毛泽东思想光辉的崭新的社会经济组织。它架起了通向共产主义社会的桥梁，是我们广大贫下中农的命根子。但是，中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人，却十分仇恨人民公社，他们吃着我们公社社员用辛勤劳动生产出来的细米、白面，却恶毒地攻击人民公社办“糟”了，把社会主义的新农村诬蔑成“漆黑一团”。这简直是给社会主义抹黑，为资本主义招魂。今天，我要摆摆我们西铺大队十年来的巨大变化，用铁的事实戳穿他们的谎言。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“只有社会主义能够救中国”，我们西铺人有最切身的体会。我们村过去穷得出了名。有一首歌谣形容我们过去的悲惨生活：“早吃菜，午咽糠，晚饭稀粥照月亮。”解放后，我们西铺的“穷棒子”从苦海里翻了身，但由于分散落后的小农经济顶不住天灾人祸，两极分化很严重。一九五二年冬天，我们响应毛主席的伟大号召，办起了“穷棒子社”，村里的地主、富农讽刺我们说，“穷棒子凑在一起，早晚也得穷散了。”我们人穷志不穷，遵照毛主席的教导，和阶级敌人斗，和天灾斗，集体经济越来越巩固。在农业合作化运动高潮中，伟大领袖毛主席把我们穷棒子社誉为“我们整个国家的形象”。
    随着生产的发展，我们越来越感到这样一村一社的小集体，不能适应生产发展的需要。正在这时，我们伟大领袖毛主席发出“还是办人民公社好”的伟大号召，真是讲到了我们广大贫下中农的心眼里。一九五八年九月，我们全村敲锣打鼓地加入了人民公社。
    西铺大队的社员和全国五亿农民一道，在人民公社的康庄大道上，昂首阔步地走了整整十年。这十年，是西铺大队翻天覆地变化的十年。过去，我们西铺是山多地少，沙多土薄，亩产不过百斤。公社化为生产力的发展打开了广阔的道路。十年来，在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，我们继续发扬了“穷棒子精神”，依靠集体力量，改良土壤，兴修水利。我们建立了扬水站，把水扬到四十多米的高山上；修了十六里多长的一条环山渠道，引用“建明湖”水浇地；把三百多亩长年减产的“沥涝地”改造成了高产良田，把一百多亩坡地修成了高产稳产的“大寨田”。社员们植树造林，荒山变成了绿林、梯田，变成了果园。农、林、牧、副多种经营都得到了广泛的发展。粮食亩产比合作化初期增长了八倍多；大牲畜由建社初期的三条驴腿，发展到一百零八头，并购制了胶轮大车，还有拖拉机、锄草机、粉碎机、碾米机、水泵等大批机器设备和新式农具。看着人民公社化这十年的巨大变化，贫下中农都激动地说：“过去是三条驴腿，人扛耠子人拉犁；现在是骡马成群，胶车水泵拖拉机。”
    人民公社化的十年，是战斗的十年。两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，在西铺大队始终没有停息过。还在人民公社刚刚搭架子的时候，阶级敌人就千方百计想搞垮它。他们煽动群众要把高级社的公共积累分净吃光，光杆入社。党支部及时发动贫下中农，揭穿了阶级敌人的阴谋。他们说，“我们穷棒子社，是毛主席表扬的社，分了公共积累，就等于拆了社会主义的台。我们贫下中农要为毛主席争气，绝不能上阶级敌人的当！”一九五八年九月六日，建明人民公社诞生的时候，我们把全部积累四十多万元入了社。
    人民公社的诞生，使我国集体化事业跃进到一个新的阶段，这对于那些梦想复辟资本主义的家伙是一个致命的打击，他们千方百计寻机破坏。一九五九年冬，我们西铺广大贫下中农正在进一步发扬自力更生、奋发图强的精神，建设自己田园的时候，中国赫鲁晓夫在河北省的代理人在我们大队大搞“物质刺激”，说什么“为了使建明公社尽快实现机械化、电气化、水利化、化肥化，你们需要多少钱就给多少钱”。用毛泽东思想武装起来的贫下中农，一眼就看穿了这是他们的阴谋诡计，愤愤地说：“我们不能忘记毛主席
  ‘勤俭办社’的教导，说什么也不能依赖国家”。西铺的阶级敌人却在群众中唱反调说：“送到嘴里边的肉不吃，王国藩的胳膊肘往外扭”。但是，我们西铺的广大贫下中农坚持勤俭办社的“穷棒子”精神，没用国家的钱，只动用了一部分公共积累，就把一些农业基本建设办起来了。我们依靠集体力量，顶住了阶级敌人的经济腐蚀，坚持了社会主义方向。
    在三年经济困难时期，中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人刮起了“三自一包”的黑风，西铺广大贫下中农，在党支部领导下，经过忆苦思甜的阶级教育，坚决顶住这股资本主义逆流。当时，省和县的走资派来到西铺，提出：“你们是红旗，包产到户也应走在前面”，让大伙开会讨论。许多老贫农当场就驳斥说：“解放时，我们每家也都分了地，可是过不久，不还是富的富，穷的穷。要分田单干，这不是要我们走回头路，受二茬苦吗？……”讨论会变成了批判会。许多贫下中农擦亮眼睛，提高了政治觉悟，把下放的自留地、小开荒交给集体，公社更加巩固了。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人，网罗社会上的牛鬼蛇神，妄图篡政变天。我们在驻军毛泽东思想宣传队的大力帮助下，深入持久地开展革命大批判，一次又一次地打退了阶级敌人的反扑，巩固了无产阶级专政。
    经过无产阶级文化大革命的洗礼，我们西铺人的精神面貌为之一新。各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班如雨后春笋般建立起来，革命大批判的烈火越烧越旺。从八十多岁的老人到刚刚懂事的小娃娃，人人都在努力地活学活用毛主席著作，个个都在关心国家大事，天天都在批判资产阶级，事事都关心着集体经济的巩固发展，坚持社会主义方向。为革命种田的思想大大发扬。一心为公，热爱集体的好人好事，层出不穷。
    我们西铺大队的贫下中农从十年的实践中，深深体会到：人民公社就是好！人民公社是我们贫下中农的命根子，我们贫下中农是人民公社的顶梁柱。伟大领袖毛主席指引的社会主义光明大道，我们贫下中农是认准了，走定了。
