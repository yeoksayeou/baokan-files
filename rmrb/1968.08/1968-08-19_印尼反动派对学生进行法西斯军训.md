The Indonesian fascist military regime has organized reactionary armed forces in universities across the country, intensifying fascist military training for students that is anti-communist and anti-people.

According to reports from Western news agencies, recently, following the orders of the head of the Indonesian fascist military regime, Suharto, most universities in Indonesian cities have established armed "student brigades." These "student brigades" are subordinate to the army and are trained in counter-revolutionary military tactics by the army. According to the Antara News Agency, 47 key members of two "student brigades" in Jakarta are currently receiving training in the use of American and Soviet weapons for jungle warfare, amphibious operations, and naval combat near Maja in West Java.

Both Suharto and Nasution have admitted that the "student brigades" and the Indonesian reactionary armed forces are tools used by the Indonesian fascist military regime to suppress the revolutionary struggles of the Indonesian people.
