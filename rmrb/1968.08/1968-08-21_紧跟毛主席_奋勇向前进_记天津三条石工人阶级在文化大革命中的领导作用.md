The great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "Our country has 700 million people. The working class is the leading class. We must fully bring into play the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in all work. The working class should also constantly raise its political consciousness in the struggle."

In the midst of the triumphant songs of victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, as the military and people across the nation enthusiastically acclaim Chairman Mao's latest directive, we visited the San Tiao Shi industrial area of Tianjin with hearts full of excitement.

San Tiao Shi is the birthplace of the machinery and cast iron industries in North China and the cradle of the Tianjin working class. The working class of San Tiao Shi, with its glorious revolutionary tradition, has, at every critical moment in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, amid the fierce struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads, remained loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao with boundless devotion. They have followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, insisted on letting Mao Zedong Thought take the command, fully brought into play their leading and vanguard roles, led the broad revolutionary masses to brave the storms and forge ahead, and composed one triumphant song after another that shines with the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought. In the great march to achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the working class of San Tiao Shi is determined to follow Chairman Mao's great teachings, constantly raise their political consciousness in the struggle, advance courageously along the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao, and build San Tiao Shi into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought!

Following Chairman Mao's Great Strategic Deployments

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the working class of San Tiao Shi has been infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They have followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments and marched from victory to victory.

A document recording the glorious fighting history of the San Tiao Shi working class vividly and deeply shows how, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the San Tiao Shi working class has resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's latest directives and fully brought into play their leading role:

In August 1966, the great leader Chairman Mao issued the great and historic "Bombard the Headquarters" big-character poster. The workers of various factories in San Tiao Shi immediately sprang into action, hoisting high the banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries," undaunted by the white terror of being labeled "counter-revolutionaries" by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, breaking through the numerous obstacles of the bourgeois reactionary line, and bravely fighting, fiercely criticizing the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. By January 1967, the revolutionary masses of all factories had seized back all the power usurped by the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party;

In September 1967, the *People's Daily* conveyed Chairman Mao's latest directive: "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." The old workers' propaganda team and the PLA's left-supporting personnel, upon hearing Chairman Mao's latest directive late at night, immediately sprang into action, running through the streets of San Tiao Shi at full speed, and conveying Chairman Mao's latest directive to every factory and every worker as quickly as possible. Within three days, all factories in San Tiao Shi had achieved great revolutionary unity;

Chairman Mao issued the great directive "Revolutionary committees are good." The working class of San Tiao Shi, which had achieved great revolutionary unity, immediately studied and resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's latest directive, taking steps to establish temporary power organs of the three-in-one combination, and quickly established revolutionary committees in all factories, achieving a sea of red in Tianjin earlier than anywhere else in the city; ...

"Following Chairman Mao, workers gain liberation; following Chairman Mao, the world turns red!" The workers of San Tiao Shi have deeply realized through long-term revolutionary struggles that the working class can only bring into play their leading role and fulfill their great historical mission by listening to Chairman Mao's words and acting resolutely according to Mao Zedong Thought.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads has been extremely fierce. Various non-proletarian thoughts have continuously assaulted the ranks of the revolutionary masses. The working class of San Tiao Shi has always firmly listened to Chairman Mao's words, unconditionally executed Chairman Mao's series of latest directives, unified their thoughts, steps, and actions under the command of Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters, braved the winds and waves, and courageously defended Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Last summer, a handful of class enemies spread anarchist thoughts, incited bourgeois factionalism, and plotted to sabotage the revolution and production, disrupting Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments. At this time, Xu Dewei, an old worker from the flour mill who rarely spoke, stood up and firmly said: "We workers do not listen to the words of bourgeois factionalism but only listen to the words of the great teacher Chairman Mao and the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin! We must resolutely smash the class enemies' plots to sabotage the revolution and production!" Xu Dewei led the workshop workers to guard their revolutionary and production posts and set up a youth workers' spare-time Mao Zedong Thought study class in the workshop, personally serving as the instructor, leading the youths to study Chairman Mao's teachings on "Strengthening discipline, invincibility in revolution" and "Grasp revolution, promote production," and fiercely criticizing the reactionary anarchist thoughts. This study class initially had only a few people, but later all the youth workers in the workshop joined. Through study, the workers smashed the class enemies' plots and tricks, and everyone strove to be the vanguard of the revolution and the model of production.

In the stormy waves of class struggle, the working class of San Tiao Shi always paid attention to arming their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, constantly raising their political consciousness, and ensuring that their actions never deviated from the track of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. After the establishment of the workers' congress in Hongqiao District, where San Tiao Shi is located, they arranged the office in a spacious and comfortable courtyard formerly owned by a reactionary capitalist. The responsible person of the workers' congress, Lu Naipeng, initially thought that workers, having taken power, should live in more spacious accommodations. At this time, some old workers reminded him: "We must listen to Chairman Mao's words, be vigilant against the sugar-coated bullets of the bourgeoisie, and always maintain the revolutionary character of the working class!" Lu Naipeng immediately convened a meeting of the standing committee of the workers' congress, studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "We communists are not seeking office but are seeking revolution. We must all have thorough revolutionary spirit. We must not for a moment depart from the masses." They studied and acted, resolutely following Chairman Mao's teachings. That very day, they moved out of the large courtyard, carrying the sign of the workers' congress, and set up their home in the changing room of a high-temperature workshop in a factory in San Tiao Shi. Lu Naipeng said: "We workers must, according to Mao Zedong Thought, transform society while constantly transforming ourselves, raising our political consciousness, and thus better bringing into play our leading role."

The Main Force of the Revolutionary Criticism

The working class of San Tiao Shi, who hoisted high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, is the main force of the revolutionary criticism. They led the broad revolutionary masses to fiercely criticize the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party led by China's Khrushchev, fiercely criticize the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, and thoroughly cleanse the filth of the old world, burying the old world in the revolutionary criticism.

The working class of San Tiao Shi suffered immense oppression and exploitation from imperialism, the bourgeoisie, and feudal forces in the old society. On the narrow streets paved with three rows of green stones, countless class brothers died from overwork, hunger, cold, or were beaten to death by capitalists and foremen. At that time, a folk song went: "Entering San Tiao Shi, suffering hellish torment; eating pig and dog food, suffering beastly torment; whipped and beaten with sticks, breaking bones and tendons; blood stains San Tiao Shi, hatred in the heart!"

After liberation, China's Khrushchev came to Tianjin and engaged in counter-revolutionary activities to restore capitalism. He sang praises for the evil bourgeoisie, shouting loudly about the theory of "extinction of class struggle" and "exploitation is meritorious," and through his agents in Tianjin, placed big and small capitalists and remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries in leading positions in many factories in San Tiao Shi, allowing them to continue to oppress the worker masses cruelly, attempting to turn San Tiao Shi into a nest for restoring capitalism.

The deep hatred for capitalism and revisionism, and for China's Khrushchev, made the working class of San Tiao Shi deeply understand the great significance of Chairman Mao's teaching on "criticizing the bourgeoisie." They led the broad revolutionary masses, organizing hundreds of revolutionary criticism fighting teams. From factories to streets, from work teams to families, revolutionary criticism blazed everywhere, with men, women, old, and young all joining in, forming a net to encircle China's Khrushchev.

In the vast revolutionary criticism army of San Tiao Shi, the old workers who had suffered deeply were always at the forefront of the struggle. They organized a famous old workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team in Tianjin, going to factories, rural areas, schools, and institutions, fighting wherever the struggle was most intense. In less than a year, they gave criticism reports to over 500,000 people in more than 1,000 units, using their personal experiences to recount the bitterness of being oppressed and exploited by capitalists in the old society, and fiercely criticize China's Khrushchev's heinous crimes of attempting to restore capitalism. Wherever they went, they made the revolutionary criticism fire burn brighter.

The first to join the propaganda team was the 63-year-old old worker Wang Fuyuan. Wang Fuyuan started working in a factory in San Tiao Shi at the age of 13. The capitalist bought a new machine and, fearing that others would learn from it, locked him and the machine in a small dark room, forcing him to work inside, not even allowing him to go out to urinate. In those days without sunlight, Wang Fuyuan suffered immense torture, and within seven years, nine of his ten fingers were crushed by the machine, and finally, he was kicked out of the factory by the capitalist.

When Wang Fuyuan began to participate in the propaganda team, someone said to him: "You are old, and your legs are not convenient, stay at home and rest." The old man firmly said: "I have suffered more, my hatred for China's Khrushchev is greater, I must participate in the propaganda team." A few malicious people sneered: "Scholars write articles, cadres give reports, you uneducated people, you can't speak, you can't write, what can you propagate?" Wang Fuyuan refuted: "The propaganda team's fighting relies on Mao Zedong Thought! We old workers have deep bitterness and hatred, we have the right to speak, our words are the most powerful!" Wang Fuyuan not only traveled through all the factories in San Tiao Shi but also went to factories, schools, and people's communes hundreds of miles away to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, becoming the most active member of the propaganda team. At one criticism meeting after another, he raised his ten mutilated fingers, a powerful witness to the evil of the old society, and angrily denounced China's Khrushchev's heinous crimes of attempting to restore capitalism, stirring up the indignation of the revolutionary masses. Workers, commune members, revolutionary cadres, and Red Guards who had heard the old man's report all firmly declared: Never allow the bitter days of the old society to return! Never allow China's Khrushchev's plot to restore capitalism to succeed!

There was a school where, due to the incitement of class enemies spreading bourgeois factionalism and advocating the erroneous idea of "me first," two mass organizations were seriously opposed for a period, and great revolutionary unity had not been achieved. After hearing Wang Fuyuan's report, the class consciousness of both factions greatly increased, and they stood side by side with the old man, firmly holding his hands, and said painfully: "We caused the split, falling for the class enemies' tricks!" They immediately went back and seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest directives and quickly achieved great revolutionary unity.

The team leader Deng Ziping, who started working at the age of six, stepping on wooden stools by the machine, working for the capitalist, sleeping on a bench only half a meter wide in the summer, and hugging a dog for warmth in the winter. His brother was injured at work and buried alive by the capitalist; his sister was forced by the landlord to be sold to someone. After the establishment of the revolutionary committee in the factory where Deng Ziping worked, some people thought that the capitalist-roaders were "dead tigers," and a slack and complacent mentality emerged, relaxing the revolutionary criticism. At this time, Deng Ziping and his comrades restudied Chairman Mao's teachings on "never forget class struggle," analyzed the new situation, new characteristics, and new trends of class struggle within the factory, and discovered that a handful of unrepentant capitalist-roaders colluded with the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries, secretly engaging in overturning cases, including the reactionary capitalist who had harmed Deng Ziping's family. Deng Ziping, with a heart full of anger, together with the revolutionary masses, dragged this capitalist out into the open and criticized him as a living example, giving a vivid class education lesson to the broad revolutionary masses, greatly raising everyone's class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness. Thus, the revolutionary criticism fire of fierce attacks on class enemies burned more fiercely in various factories in San Tiao Shi.

Model of Revolution and Production

After more than two years of baptism in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, San Tiao Shi is everywhere a scene of revolutionary torrents surging and production boiling. In the more than 60 factories in San Tiao Shi, every workshop or team, every courtyard where workers live, is a lively Mao Zedong Thought study class. Whether young workers, old workers, women, or children, everyone reads Chairman Mao's books every day, studies the "Old Three Articles," and sings revolutionary songs. The widespread dissemination of Mao Zedong Thought has powerfully promoted the continuous development of the revolution and production.

Under the invincible guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the working class of San Tiao Shi has shown boundless wisdom and talent in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation. They smashed the class enemies' various plots to sabotage the Cultural Revolution, seized the revolutionary and production power of the factories, and made the enterprises better and better along the revolutionary line of Chairman Mao. After the establishment of the revolutionary committees in various factories, production generally rose sharply, and many products created historical high records.

The largest aluminum factory in Tianjin, when the Cultural Revolution was just ignited, the capitalist-roaders in the factory played tricks, attempting to disrupt production to disrupt the Cultural Revolution. They abandoned a smelting workshop construction project that had just started and threatened the workers: "You have turned everything upside down, production is disrupted, and you will bear all the responsibility!" The workers, with great heroic spirit, resolutely replied: "'Only heroes can drive tigers and leopards, and there are no heroes afraid of bears and wolves.' Throwing away these stumbling blocks, the wheels of socialism will turn faster; with Mao Zedong Thought guiding us, the factory will be built better!" They promptly saw through and smashed the capitalist-roaders' tricks, and elected Li Qinghai of the smelting workshop to take charge of the factory's production.

Li Qinghai, although he had never been to school in the old society, had a heart infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao. He relied on the worker masses in everything, bravely shouldering the responsibility of leading and commanding the factory's production. He led the workers to the smelting workshop construction site, loudly reading Chairman Mao's quotations: "We are not only good at destroying an old world, we will also be good at building a new world." Inspired by Chairman Mao's great teachings, the workers took the initiative, designed and manufactured an electric furnace and a 24-meter-long crane, quickly completing the reconstruction of the smelting workshop. The factory's production did not stop for a day, completing the plan month after month, and creating the highest production record in history this July.

Chairman Mao said: "Revolution is the liberation of productive forces, revolution is the promotion of the development of productive forces." The working class threw away the stubborn capitalist-roaders and bourgeois reactionary "experts" and "authorities," broke free from the shackles of the revisionist enterprise management system, and greatly liberated productive forces. The Xiangyang Sock Factory, where women workers are in the majority, was said by the capitalist-roaders before the Cultural Revolution: "Many mothers with children are hard to manage." They used various tricks such as control, restriction, oppression, punishment, and rewards to bind the workers' hands and feet, turning the Xiangyang Sock Factory into a "dead water," becoming a famous backward unit in San Tiao Shi. During the Cultural Revolution, those mothers with children and young women who were previously not valued stood up to rebel, thoroughly smashed the revisionist management system, and ran the factory with Mao Zedong Thought, fully bringing into play the leading role and revolutionary pioneering spirit of the working class in production. Originally, one person operated two sock machines, and one shift produced less than 100 pairs of socks; now, one person operates three sock machines, and one shift produces more than 180 pairs of socks. The workers said: "Mao Zedong Thought shines, people change their minds, the factory changes its appearance, Xiangyang Sock Factory sings a new song, the Cultural Revolution triumphs."

During the Cultural Revolution, the working class of San Tiao Shi used Mao Zedong Thought to guide scientific experiments and achieved great results, completing more than 140 technical innovation projects in the first half of this year alone.

Several workers with only primary school education from the Machine Tool Accessory Factory, through studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, successfully developed China's first adjustable high-precision chuck. As early as 1964, they began to develop this product, but a handful of capitalist-roaders in the factory used every means to obstruct and suppress, saying: "What can uneducated people do? Just copy the foreign samples." Finally, they forcibly announced "no experimentation." In the Cultural Revolution, after overthrowing the capitalist-roaders, these workers organized again. They angrily criticized China's Khrushchev and his agents in the factory for advocating slavery, crawling, and worshipping foreign thoughts, and followed Chairman Mao's teachings: "We cannot follow the old path of technological development of all countries in the world, crawling step by step behind others. We must break the conventions and adopt advanced technology as much as possible," daringly developing. The working class armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought can create any miracle! In the triumphant songs of achieving comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution, they finally successfully developed an adjustable high-precision chuck that is smaller in size and better in performance than foreign similar products and put it into mass production.

San Tiao Shi advances in the stormy waves of class struggle. The working class of San Tiao Shi grows in the blazing fire of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, in the great struggle to achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the working class of San Tiao Shi is marching forward with more heroic steps, from victory to victory!

    紧跟毛主席　奋勇向前进
    ——记天津三条石工人阶级在文化大革命中的领导作用
    伟大领袖毛主席最近指出：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”
    在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，在全国军民热烈欢呼毛主席这一最新指示发表的时候，我们怀着激动的心情，访问了天津市三条石工业区。
    三条石，是华北地区机器、铸铁工业的发源地，是天津工人阶级的摇篮。有着光荣革命传统的三条石工人阶级，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线激烈搏斗的每一个关键时刻，都怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠诚，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚持用毛泽东思想挂帅，充分发挥领导作用和主力军作用，带领广大革命群众，乘风破浪，奋勇前进，谱写了一曲又一曲闪耀着毛泽东思想灿烂光辉的胜利凯歌。在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大进军中，三条石的工人阶级决心遵照毛主席的伟大教导，在斗争中不断地提高自己的政治觉悟，沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线勇往直前，把三条石建设成为红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校！
      紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署
    在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，三条石的工人阶级无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的革命路线，他们紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，从胜利走向胜利。
    一份记载三条石工人阶级光辉战斗历程的材料，最生动、最深刻地表明，在无产阶级文化大革命中，三条石工人阶级是如何坚决落实毛主席的最新指示，充分发挥领导作用的：
    一九六六年八月，伟大领袖毛主席发表了具有伟大历史意义的《炮打司令部》的大字报，三条石各工厂的工人立即行动起来，高举“对反动派造反有理”的大旗，不顾被党内一小撮走资派打成“反革命”的白色恐怖，冲破资产阶级反动路线的重重阻拦，英勇战斗，大造党内一小撮走资派的反。到一九六七年一月，所有工厂的无产阶级革命派都从党内一小撮走资派手中夺回了被他们窃夺的一切大权；
    一九六七年九月，《人民日报》传达了毛主席的最新指示：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”三条石老工人宣传队和解放军支左人员深夜听到毛主席的最新指示，立即行动起来，跑步穿过三条石大街，以最快的速度把毛主席的最新指示传到每一家工厂，每一个工人。三天之内，三条石的所有工厂全部实现了革命大联合；
    毛主席发出了“革命委员会好”的伟大指示，实现了革命大联合的三条石工人阶级，立刻认真学习、坚决落实毛主席的最新指示，着手筹建革命三结合的临时权力机构，各工厂迅速地全部建立了革命委员会，在天津全市最早实现一片红；……
    “跟着毛主席，工人得解放；跟着毛主席，天下一片红！”三条石的工人在长期的革命斗争中深切地认识到，工人阶级只有听毛主席的话，坚决按照毛泽东思想办事，才能发挥领导作用，才能完成历史赋予的伟大使命。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争非常激烈，形形色色的非无产阶级思想，不断冲击着无产阶级革命派的队伍。三条石工人阶级始终坚定不移地听毛主席的话，不折不扣地执行毛主席的一系列最新指示，在毛主席的无产阶级司令部的号令下，统一认识、统一步伐、统一行动，顶逆风，战恶浪，勇敢地捍卫毛主席的革命路线。去年夏天，一小撮阶级敌人散布无政府主义思潮，煽动资产阶级派性，阴谋破坏抓革命促生产，干扰毛主席的伟大战略部署。这时，平时很少讲话的面粉机厂老钳工许德玮挺身而出，坚定地说：“我们工人阶级不听资产阶级派性的话，只听伟大导师毛主席的话，听以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的话！我们要坚决粉碎阶级敌人破坏抓革命促生产的阴谋！”许德玮带领车间工人坚守革命和生产岗位，并在车间里办起了青年工人业余毛泽东思想学习班，亲自担任辅导员，领着青年们学习毛主席的“加强纪律性，革命无不胜”和“抓革命，促生产”的教导，狠狠地批判反动的无政府主义思潮。这个学习班最初只有几个人，后来车间的青年工人都参加了。工人们经过学习，粉碎了阶级敌人的阴谋诡计，人人争做革命的先锋，生产的模范。
    在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，三条石工人阶级时刻注意用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，不断提高自己的政治觉悟，使自己的行动步步不离毛主席革命路线的轨道。三条石所在的红桥区工代会成立后，把办公的地方安排在一个反动资本家过去住的宽敞舒适的大院里。工代会负责人卢乃鹏开始认为，工人当了家，应该住得宽敞一些。这时，有的老工人提醒他：“我们要听毛主席的话，要警惕资产阶级糖衣炮弹的进攻，要永远保持工人阶级的革命本色啊！”卢乃鹏立即召开工代会常委会，学习毛主席的教导：“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命，我们人人要有彻底的革命精神，我们不要有一时一刻脱离群众。”他们学了就用，坚决按照毛主席的教导办事，当天，就搬出了那个大院，抬着工代会的牌子，到三条石一个工厂的高温车间的更衣室里安了家。卢乃鹏说：“我们工人阶级就是要按照毛泽东思想在改造社会的同时，不断地改造自己，提高自己的政治觉悟，这样就能更好地发挥领导作用。”
      革命大批判的主力军
    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的三条石工人阶级，是革命大批判的主力军。他们带领广大革命群众，猛烈地批判以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派，猛烈地批判资产阶级和一切剥削阶级，荡涤旧世界的一切污泥浊水，在革命大批判中埋葬旧世界。
    三条石工人阶级，在旧社会受尽帝国主义、资产阶级和封建势力的残酷压迫和剥削。在三行青石铺成的狭窄马路上，多少阶级兄弟活活累死、饿死、冻死，或者被资本家、工头打死。当时，流传着这样一首歌谣：“进了三条石，活受地狱罪；吃的猪狗饭，受的牛马罪；鞭抽棍棒打，腰断筋骨碎；血染三条石，仇恨记心内！”
    解放后，中国赫鲁晓夫跑到天津，大干复辟资本主义的反革命勾当。他对万恶的资产阶级大唱颂歌，声嘶力竭地鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭”论、“剥削有功”论，并且通过他在天津的代理人，把大大小小的资本家和国民党反动派的残渣余孽安插到三条石许多工厂的领导岗位上，让他们继续残酷地欺压工人群众，妄图把三条石变成复辟资本主义的黑窝。
    对资本主义、修正主义，对中国赫鲁晓夫的深仇大恨，使三条石工人阶级最能深刻地理解毛主席关于“要批判资产阶级”这一教导的伟大意义。他们领导广大革命群众，组织起数以百计的革命大批判战斗组。从工厂到街道，从班组到家庭，处处燃起了革命大批判的烈火，男女老少齐上阵，组成了围剿中国赫鲁晓夫的天罗地网。
    在三条石浩浩荡荡的革命批判大军中，始终站在斗争最前列的是一批苦大仇深的老工人。他们组织了一支闻名天津全市的老工人毛泽东思想宣传队，下工厂、农村，去学校、机关，那里斗争最激烈，他们就奔向那里战斗。在不到一年时间内，他们先后为一千多个单位的五十多万人作了批判报告，用他们的亲身经历，诉旧社会资本家压迫和剥削他们的苦，大揭大批中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的滔天罪行。他们走到那里，就使那里的革命大批判烈火烧得更旺。
    最早参加宣传队的是六十三岁的老工人王福元。王福元十几岁就在三条石一家工厂做工。资本家买了一台新机器，怕别人学了去，就把他和机器一起锁到一间小黑屋，强迫他在里面干活，连小便都不准出来。在那暗无天日的日子里，王福元受尽了折磨，不出七年，他的十个手指头陆续被机器砸掉了九个，最后被资本家一脚踢出了工厂。
    当王福元开始参加宣传队时，有人对他说：“你年纪大了，腿脚不灵便，在家歇着吧。”老人坚定地说：“我受的苦多，我对中国赫鲁晓夫的仇恨大，我就是要参加宣传队。”少数别有用心的人讥笑说：“秀才做文章，干部做报告，你们大老粗，一不会说，二不会写，能宣传出什么名堂？”王福元反驳道：“宣传队战斗靠的是毛泽东思想！我们老工人苦大仇深，我们最有发言权，说话最有力量！”王福元不仅走遍了三条石的工厂，还到几百里外的工厂、学校、人民公社宣传毛泽东思想，是宣传队最活跃的一名队员。在一次次批判大会上，他举起旧社会罪恶的有力见证——十指九残的双手，声泪俱下地愤怒控诉中国赫鲁晓夫妄图复辟资本主义的滔天罪行，激起了革命群众的满腔怒火。听过老人报告的工人、社员、革命干部和红卫兵小将，都坚定地表示：绝不允许旧社会的苦难日子重演！绝不允许中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的阴谋得逞！
    有一个学校，由于阶级敌人煽动资产阶级派性，鼓吹“以我为中心”的错误思想，一个时期，两个群众组织严重对立，迟迟没有实现革命大联合。听了王福元老人的报告以后，两派群众的阶级觉悟大大提高，他们并肩走到老人身边，紧握老人的双手，沉痛地说：“我们闹分裂，上了阶级敌人的当！”回去后，他们立即认真学习毛主席的最新指示，很快实现了革命大联合。
    宣传队队长邓子平，六岁起就蹬着木墩子，在机器旁给资本家干活，夏天睡在只有半尺多宽的条凳上，冬天没被盖，睡觉时搂着一条狗取暖。他的哥哥因工受伤，被资本家活埋了；姐姐被财主逼着卖给了人家。邓子平所在的工厂在革命委员会成立以后，有些人认为走资派已经是“死老虎”，产生了松劲麻痹思想，放松了革命大批判。这时，邓子平和战友们重新学习了毛主席关于“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，分析了厂内阶级斗争的新形势、新特点、新动向，发现一小撮死不悔改的走资派勾结国民党反动派的残渣余孽，在背地里大搞翻案活动，其中就有残害邓子平一家的那个反动资本家。邓子平怀着满腔怒火，和革命群众一起，把这个资本家揪到光天化日之下，当作活材料进行批判，给广大革命群众上了一堂生动的阶级教育课，极大地提高了大家的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。就这样，向阶级敌人猛烈进攻的革命大批判的烈火，在三条石各工厂更加熊熊燃烧起来。
        抓革命促生产的模范
    经过两年多无产阶级文化大革命战斗洗礼的三条石，到处是一派革命洪流滚滚，生产热气腾腾的大好景象。在三条石六十多家工厂中，每一个车间或班组，每一个工人居住的庭院，都是一个生气蓬勃的毛泽东思想学习班，不论青年工人、老工人，不论妇女、儿童，人人天天读毛主席的书，大学“老三篇”，大唱革命歌曲。毛泽东思想的大普及，有力地推动着革命和生产不断向前发展。
    在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下，三条石工人阶级在阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命运动中，表现了无穷的智慧和才能。他们粉碎了阶级敌人企图破坏文化大革命的种种阴谋，掌握了工厂的革命和生产大权，使企业沿着毛主席的革命路线越办越好。各工厂革委会成立以后，生产普遍直线上升，许多产品的产量创造了历史的最高纪录。
    天津市最大的铝品厂，在文化大革命的烈火刚刚点燃的时候，工厂的走资派就玩弄阴谋，妄图用破坏生产来破坏文化大革命，他们把一个刚刚破土动工的熔化车间改建工程扔下不管，并且威胁工人说：“你们闹翻了天，生产受到破坏，全部责任要你们负！”工人们以大无畏的英雄气概，斩钉截铁地回答：“‘独有英雄驱虎豹，更无豪杰怕熊罴。’抛开你们这些绊脚石，社会主义的车轮将会转得更快；有毛泽东思想指引，工厂会建设得更好！”他们及时识破和粉碎了走资派的阴谋，推选熔化工李庆海掌握全厂的生产大权。
    李庆海虽然在旧社会没念过一天书，但是，他有一颗无限忠于毛主席的红心。他事事处处依靠工人群众，勇敢地担负起领导和指挥全厂生产的重任。他带领工人们来到熔化车间工地，高声朗读毛主席语录：“我们不但善于破坏一个旧世界，我们还将善于建设一个新世界。”工人们在毛主席的伟大教导鼓舞下，自己动手，设计制造了一座电炉和一台长达二十四米的天车，把熔化车间迅速改建成功。全厂生产一天没有停过，月月完成计划，今年七月份还创造了历史上最高生产纪录。
    毛主席说：“革命就是解放生产力，革命就是促进生产力的发展。”工人阶级抛开了那些顽固不化的走资派和资产阶级反动“专家”、“权威”，冲破修正主义企业管理制度的束缚，生产力大大解放了。女工占绝大多数的向阳袜厂，文化大革命前，走资派说：“孩子妈妈多，就是难管理。”他们用管、卡、压、罚、奖等各种花招，束缚工人手脚，使向阳袜厂变成“死水一潭”，成为三条石一个有名的落后单位。文化大革命中，那些过去不被重视的孩子妈妈和青年女工纷纷起来造反，彻底破除了修正主义管理制度，用毛泽东思想办厂，充分发挥了工人阶级在生产中的领导作用和革命首创精神。原来一个人操作两台袜机，一班生产不到一百双袜子；现在，一个人操作三台袜机，一班生产一百八十多双袜子。工人们说：“毛泽东思想阳光照，人换思想厂变貌，向阳袜厂唱新曲，文化革命奏凯歌。”
    在文化大革命期间，三条石工人阶级用毛泽东思想指导科学实验，取得了巨大成果，仅今年上半年完成的技术革新项目就有一百四十多项。
    机床附件厂的几个只有小学文化程度的工人，通过活学活用毛主席著作，试制成功了我国第一台可调整高精度卡盘。早在一九六四年，他们就开始试制这种产品，可是，厂内一小撮走资派千方百计刁难和压制，说什么：“大老粗能搞出什么名堂？仿制外国的现成样品就行了。”最后竟强行宣布“不许试验”。在文化大革命中，打倒了走资派，这几个工人又组织起来了。他们愤怒地批判了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在厂内的代理人鼓吹的奴隶主义、爬行主义和崇洋思想的滔天罪行，遵照毛主席“我们不能走世界各国技术发展的老路，跟在别人后面一步一步地爬行。我们必须打破常规，尽量采用先进技术”的教导，进行大胆试制。用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级，什么人间奇迹也能创造！在夺取文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，他们终于试制成功了比外国同类产品体积更小、性能更好的可调整高精度卡盘，并成批投入生产。
    三条石在阶级斗争的大风大浪中前进。三条石工人阶级在无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火中成长。在毛主席无产阶级革命路线的指引下，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大斗争中，三条石工人阶级正以更豪迈的步伐，从胜利走向胜利！
