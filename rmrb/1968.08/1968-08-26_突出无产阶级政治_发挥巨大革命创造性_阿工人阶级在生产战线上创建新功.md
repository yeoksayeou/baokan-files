The heroic Albanian working class has enthusiastically responded to the call of the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour of Albania, emphasizing proletarian politics and achieving great successes in increasing production, tapping potential, saving materials, and reducing production costs.

At the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour of Albania, the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, pointed out: "We must constantly strive to establish a strict system of economy," and "oppose the wasteful and extravagant use of the people's lek (Albanian currency)." The broad masses of workers in Albania, following the teachings of Comrade Enver Hoxha, have carried forward the fine tradition of thrift among the working people, using their brains and finding ways to reduce national expenditures and accumulate more funds for socialist construction.

Due to the active promotion of the thrift movement by the workers, in the first half of this year, the industrial and mining enterprises under the Ministry of Industry and Mining have overfulfilled the plan for reducing production costs by 22 million lek, of which the Tirana Stalin Textile Combine has overfulfilled the original savings plan by reducing production costs by 4 million lek.

The workers in various local industrial and mining enterprises have further realized the great significance of thrift, which has greatly stimulated their enthusiasm for production and work. The drivers of a motor vehicle depot under the Ministry of the Interior in Tirana voluntarily gave up the bonus for tire maintenance and fuel savings. They also overfulfilled the transportation task for the first half of this year by 6 percent. The drivers of the Berat-Vlora-Gjirokastra Motor Transport Company have found various ways to save fuel, saving 22,000 liters of gasoline and diesel in the first half of this year alone. The workers of the Korça-Mbjellë-Drenovë Coal Mine have, while increasing production, paid attention to saving underground timber, further reducing production costs. The workers of the Rubik Copper Smelting Plant have, in the first quarter of this year, used raw materials rationally and saved electricity, reducing production costs for the state by about 1.5 million lek.

In order to better serve socialist construction, workers in various places have built new workshops and production lines on their own, expanding production and increasing new varieties of products. For example, the workers in the Durrës region built 11 new workshops and 26 new production lines in the first half of this year, increasing nearly 500 new products. The workers also tapped potential and manufactured many machines and equipment urgently needed for agriculture, industry, and construction. The workers of the Durrës Agricultural Machinery Factory manufactured a hydraulic press with a capacity of 320 tons.

In the vigorous movement to further revolutionize national life and people's thinking, the broad masses of workers in Albania have actively carried out the movement of rationalization proposals and technological innovations. Many factories, through the creative labor of the workers and the cooperation of workers with technical personnel, have broken away from the old operating procedures and replaced them with new technological procedures, greatly promoting production.

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Tirana, the Albanian working class has demonstrated great revolutionary creativity, proposing a large number of rationalization proposals, and promoting the development of production.

According to a report from the Albanian News Agency, in the first three months of this year alone, more than 2,000 production innovation proposals were made by workers in industrial enterprises in the Albanian capital, Tirana, of which 1,100 proposals have been adopted.

The broad masses of workers in Albania have made new achievements for socialist construction through innovation proposals. In the first five months of this year, 55 new workshops and production lines were built and added in various industrial enterprises in Tirana, which is more than the number built in the whole of last year. The workers have also guaranteed the addition of 32 new workshops and production lines by the end of this year. At the same time, the workers of Tirana have demonstrated their enthusiasm for production and creativity, producing more than 140 new types of complex machinery and equipment, as well as hundreds of parts and components urgently needed for the national economy.

    突出无产阶级政治  发挥巨大革命创造性
    阿工人阶级在生产战线上创建新功
    据新华社地拉那电　英雄的阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级，积极响应劳动党第五次代表大会的号召，突出无产阶级政治，在增加生产、挖掘潜力、节约原料和降低生产成本等方面，取得了很大成绩。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖霍查同志在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会上指出：“应该不断努力建立严格的节约制度”，“反对大手大脚地浪费和挥霍人民的里克（阿尔巴尼亚货币名）”。阿尔巴尼亚广大职工遵照霍查同志的教导，发扬劳动人民勤俭节约的优良品质，动脑筋、想办法，努力减少国家的开支，为社会主义建设积累更多的资金。
    由于工人群众积极开展节约运动，今年上半年，工业和矿产部所属的工矿企业超额二千二百万里克完成了降低生产成本的计划，其中地拉那斯大林纺织联合工厂比原定的节约计划超额降低了生产成本四百万里克。
    各地工矿企业的广大职工进一步认识到厉行节约的重大意义，从而大大地激发了生产热情和劳动干劲。地拉那内务部一个汽车场的司机自愿放弃保养轮胎和节约燃料的奖金，他们还超额百分之六完成了今年上半年的运输任务。培拉特乌拉—瓦依古洛利汽车运输公司的司机想方设法节约用油，仅今年上半年就节约了二万二千公升汽油和柴油。科尔察姆博叶—德列诺瓦煤矿职工在增产的同时，注意节约地下坑木，进一步降低了生产成本。卢比克炼铜厂职工今年第一季度合理使用原料和节约电力，为国家降低了生产成本约一百五十万里克。
    为了更好地为社会主义建设服务，各地职工自力更生地建设新车间和新作业线，以扩大生产和增加产品的新品种。例如都拉斯区职工今年上半年新建了十一个车间和二十六条作业线，增加了近五百种新产品。职工们还挖掘潜力，制造了许多工农业和建筑业十分需要的机器和设备。都拉斯农机厂的工人制成了功率达三百二十吨的水压机。
    在轰轰烈烈的国家生活和人的思想进一步革命化运动中，阿尔巴尼亚广大职工还积极开展合理化建议和技术革新运动。不少工厂通过职工们的创造性劳动以及工人同技术人员的合作，打破了过去陈旧的操作规程而代之以新的工艺规程，大大促进了生产。
    据新华社地拉那电　阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级发挥巨大的革命创造性，提出大量的合理化建议，促进了生产的发展。
    据阿尔巴尼亚通讯社报道，今年头三个月内，单是在阿尔巴尼亚首都地拉那的工业企业中，职工们提出的生产革新建议就超过了两千项，其中一千一百项建议已被采用。
    阿尔巴尼亚广大职工通过革新倡议，为社会主义建设作出了新的成绩。地拉那各工业企业在今年头五个月内，新建和增设了五十五个车间和作业线，这比去年全年建设的数字还要多。职工们还保证在今年年底以前再增设三十二个新的车间和作业线。与此同时，地拉那工人发挥生产积极性和创造精神，生产了一百四十多种新的复杂的机器和设备以及几百种国民经济十分需要的零件和配件。
