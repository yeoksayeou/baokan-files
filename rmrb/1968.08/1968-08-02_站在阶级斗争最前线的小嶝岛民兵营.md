Every morning, as the sound of conch shells echoes across the island, groups of armed male and female militia members gather, facing the rising sun over the vast blue sea. They stand in formation in front of Chairman Mao's portrait and sing "The East Is Red" with deep proletarian emotions, sincerely wishing our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman, Chairman Mao, eternal life! Then, they study Chairman Mao's teachings on never forgetting class struggle and recite Vice Chairman Lin's instructions: always remember class struggle, always remember the dictatorship of the proletariat, always prioritize politics, and always hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

The militia members of Xiaoyang Island are loyal to our great leader Chairman Mao. With heightened vigilance, they stand guard alongside the stationed troops day and night on the coastal defense line, contributing to the defense of the motherland and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They have become an advanced collective in the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought on the front lines of Fujian.

Forever Hold Tight the Guns in Our Hands, Be Good Red Guards for Chairman Mao

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, has shaken the world. All class enemies, both domestic and foreign, are terrified and enraged, trying every means to sabotage it. The Kuomintang bandits stationed on Jinmen Island are particularly disruptive from all angles. The militia on Xiaoyang Island, with unwavering loyalty and love for our great leader Chairman Mao, regard defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as their sacred duty. They never relax their vigilance against the enemy for a single moment. Their battle resolve is: forever hold tight the guns in our hands, stand at the forefront of the struggle against the enemy, and be good red guards for Chairman Mao.

The militia members, though stationed on the island, have their hearts in Beijing and their minds on the nation. They are proud to stand guard for Chairman Mao on this small island. Standing guard and patrolling by the sea, they endure the biting cold winds in winter and the biting insects in summer. But whenever they think of our great leader Chairman Mao, they fear neither the winter cold nor the summer heat. They diligently guard their posts without the slightest negligence. Once, a core militia member, Hong Yi, went to a nearby small island to support the construction of the troops. When it was time to return to Xiaoyang Island, the last transport boat had already left. The troops repeatedly urged him to stay the night, but he refused, saying, "If I miss the night shift, I am not worthy of being a red guard for Chairman Mao." He jumped into the rolling sea and swam across more than two thousand meters of water to arrive at the guard post on time. Female militia member Qiu Wangkan, who had married to Dajian Island, always went to her familiar guard post by the sea whenever she visited her parents. Someone asked her, "Wangkan, you are a guest now, why do you always stand guard when you come back?" She replied, "Being a good red guard for Chairman Mao is a tradition of Xiaoyang Island. Although I have left, my loyalty to Chairman Mao remains."

Indeed, the tradition of being good red guards for Chairman Mao is being passed down from generation to generation on Xiaoyang Island.

The party branch secretary and militia camp instructor of the production brigade, Hong Xiucong, is the first generation of militia on Xiaoyang Island. Countless deep nights, she led the militia to scout the enemy's movements across the strait; countless damp dawns, she and the militia together captured infiltrating "sea ghosts." From being a militia member to a cadre, from a young girl to a married woman, it has been more than a decade, and she has never left the battlefield. Her firm belief is: to live is to fight for Chairman Mao, to die is to sacrifice for Chairman Mao. Now, she is a mother of four children, and she still insists on standing guard as before. Her children have also developed a habit: whenever it is Hong Xiucong's turn to stand guard, they say, "Mom, it's our turn to stand guard for Chairman Mao tonight!" Saying this, they obediently follow their mother. Arriving at the guard post, the children become like adults, neither noisy nor disruptive, hiding themselves, following their mother's orders, and watching all around. If there is any movement, they report to their mother, "There is enemy activity!" Her children often compete to say that when they grow up, they will carry their mother's gun to defend the motherland.

Nearly fifty-year-old veteran militia member Hong Musheng is an old hero who wields a spear and has captured many "sea ghosts." To pass on the baton of the "red guard" to his children, a few years ago, he often took his son Hong Xueyu to the sea to stand guard, personally teaching him how to use the terrain and how to judge enemy movements. When Hong Xueyu was old enough to join the militia, Hong Musheng enrolled his son and requested that they be assigned to the same platoon. Since then, father and son have fought side by side, never missing a single shift, and are known as the "father-son iron guard post." Last year, Hong Musheng's eyesight began to fail, and the organization persuaded him to retire, but he voluntarily applied for his daughter Hong Lijiu, who had just reached the age to join the militia, to join and requested that the party branch approve the transfer of his gun to his daughter. After Hong Lijiu was approved to join, he led Xueyu and Lijiu to the beach facing Jinmen, handing them two copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and his used gun, and solemnly told them, "I have stood guard here for eighteen years without ever being negligent. For the sake of Chairman Mao, I really do not want to put down this gun, but my eyesight is failing. Now, I have to pass this gun to you, passing on the responsibility of defending Chairman Mao and the motherland to you. You must never let this gun rust and let the enemy climb up from here!" Encouraged by their father, Xueyu and Lijiu enthusiastically declared on the spot, "We firmly guarantee that we will be good red guards for Chairman Mao, just like our father!"

Day and Night Guarding the Coastal Defense Line, Achieving New Merits in the Cultural Revolution

The Kuomintang bandits stationed on Jinmen Island regard Xiaoyang Island as a thorn in their side, a constant irritation, and have never stopped trying to sabotage and disrupt it. Over the past decade, the enemy has fired more than seventy thousand shells at this island of less than one square kilometer, not a single house has escaped damage, and not a single piece of land is without shell craters. However, the heroic militia of Xiaoyang Island, when their houses are destroyed, they rebuild; when their crops are ruined, they replant; when the enemy comes during the day, they fight during the day; when the enemy comes at night, they fight at night, always maintaining a head-on struggle with the enemy without giving an inch, dealing heavy blows to the enemy and achieving one victory after another.

One rainy night, a group of American-Kuomintang armed special forces attempted to sneak attack Xiaoyang Island. As soon as the militia received the enemy alert, they immediately loaded their guns, drew their swords, and rushed to the beach, controlling the shallows, the dock, and the sea. At that time, the female militia platoon leader Qiu Wangkan led her younger brother Hong Ronghe, Yu Guo, and female militia members Xu Fenli and Zhou Meixu to quickly run to the artillery position, helping the troops set up the gun carriage, transport artillery shells, load the gunpowder bags, and fired eighteen illuminating shells in one breath, illuminating the sea surface brightly, leaving the enemy nowhere to hide. Immediately, all positions opened fire on the enemy, wounding and killing many. A few enemy soldiers attempted to retreat, but they were already blocked by the militia deputy camp commander Hong Jinshan and veteran militia member Hong Mashao and five others who had gone out in boats, and finally became prisoners under the "red guards."

Over the years, the militia of Xiaoyang Island have thus captured dozens of American-Kuomintang special forces, contributing to the defense of the motherland and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

While militarily provoking Xiaoyang Island, the enemy also plays political deception. The broadcasting stations on Jinmen Island increased from one to three, and the broken loudspeakers increased from a few to more than twenty, broadcasting from early morning to late night the worn-out clichés picked up from the Americans and the Soviet revisionists. The militia members were very angry and decided to give a stern rebuke to the enemy's slander and lies.

The most powerful weapon to counter the enemy is the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. The more the enemy opposes the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the more the militia members must ensure that the news of the great victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, reaches the enemy-occupied island.

To drown out the enemy's broken loudspeakers on Jinmen Island, the militia of Xiaoyang Island, together with the stationed troops, jointly set up a Mao Zedong Thought propaganda station, installing powerful loudspeakers that broadcast the news of the great victories of the Cultural Revolution day and night. At the same time, they also use artillery shells and kites to scatter batches of propaganda materials shining with the light of Mao Zedong Thought towards Jinmen.

Before the Spring Festival this year, the militia received a batch of propaganda materials with photographs of our great leader Chairman Mao warmly receiving the Red Guards. Everyone was very happy and wanted to send this batch of propaganda materials to the enemy island as soon as possible. Unfortunately, that day the wind direction on the sea was not suitable for flying kites. The militia camp commander Zhou Mourong, core militia members Qiu Ziyang and Xu Weihan, took a boat out to sea near the enemy-occupied island to fly the kites. With fighting spirit, they braved the wind and waves, driving the boat to the vicinity of Jinmen Island. When they could clearly see the enemy's dog-tooth flags and fort eyes, they released the propaganda materials with the current. Suddenly, on a four-hundred-meter-long sea surface, countless plastic balls floated towards Jinmen Island, presenting a magnificent scene. The enemy had not yet discovered their boat, and they had already returned victorious.

This Spring Festival, the artillery leadership of the Fujian front announced a two-day suspension of artillery fire to allow the people of Jinmen and the Kuomintang soldiers to celebrate the Spring Festival. Usually, the Kuomintang soldiers dare not come out, but at this time, they all came out of their underground holes. The militia members saw this as a good opportunity for propaganda. The political work leader of the militia camp, Zhang Jinzhao, led a few militia members to the beach with the largest kite. Their kite soared into the sky, straight towards Jinmen, and landed precisely on a flagpole on the top of Mashan on Jinmen Island. As soon as the kite landed, a giant red banner immediately unfolded, like a high-flying red flag, with twenty-four golden words: "Long live, long, long live our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao!" The people of Jinmen, despite the enemy's obstruction, rushed to Mashan, gazing at the red banner, reluctant to leave. Seeing this scene, the militia members all clapped their hands in approval!

Over the past two years, the militia of Xiaoyang Island have sent more than four hundred and forty thousand propaganda materials to Jinmen Island. These propaganda materials have bloomed in the enemy's heart, greatly encouraging the people of Jinmen.

Firing Cannons at the Americans and the Kuomintang, Firing Cannons at "Cultivation," Burning the Fiery Torch of Revolutionary Criticism Even Higher

The militia of Xiaoyang Island firmly remember the great teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao to never forget class struggle. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they have launched a fierce struggle against a handful of class enemies who do not carry guns. They say, "In front of us, there are two kinds of enemies: one is the armed American-Kuomintang reactionaries, and the other is the handful of capitalist roaders within the party and the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries supported and protected by them. We must not show mercy to these two kinds of enemies." They have put forward the battle slogan of "firing cannons at the Americans and the Kuomintang, firing cannons at 'Cultivation,'" fiercely criticizing and fighting against the handful of class enemies who do not carry guns.

The angry waves of revolutionary criticism have surged across Xiaoyang Island with a momentum that surpasses the waves of the East China Sea. In the guard posts, battle positions, fields, and fishing grounds, the militia have set up battlefields for revolutionary criticism everywhere, fiercely criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies of China's Khrushchev.

As soon as the battle cry of revolutionary criticism sounded, the militia first launched a fierce attack on China's Khrushchev's "theory of the extinction of class struggle" and "theory of the merit of exploitation." In the battle of shelling Jinmen, the model of supporting the frontlines, poor peasant Zhang Gang's mother, personally sent her son to the frontlines, went to the battle positions three times to encourage her son to fight bravely, and told her son, "If you cannot achieve military merit, do not come back to see your mother." At the revolutionary criticism meeting, she said with great hatred for China's Khrushchev, "In the evil old society, my husband went fishing at sea and was killed by the Japanese invaders, and we could not afford a coffin, using the wall panels to make a coffin; my son was so hungry that he went fishing in the big winds and waves, and never came back; my mother-in-law fell ill and could not afford a doctor, and was not buried for three days after her death. This is the blood-stained history of our poor people being exploited. China's Khrushchev says 'exploitation is meritorious,' whose merit is this? This is the merit of the landlords, capitalists, and fish tyrants. Saying 'exploitation is salvation,' who is being saved? It is saving the Kuomintang reactionaries, saving the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. The open enemy is right in front of us, and the hidden enemy still exists. This is called 'the extinction of class struggle'? China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary fallacies are trying to drag us back to the old society, take the capitalist road, suffer twice, we poor and lower-middle peasants will never agree. We must resolutely overthrow China's Khrushchev!"

Now, the fiery torch of revolutionary criticism is burning even more fiercely on Xiaoyang Island. The militia have peeled off China's Khrushchev's mask, repeatedly criticized his counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies, and criticized his "three freedoms and one contract," "four freedoms," and "public-private fusion" theory and other counter-revolutionary revisionist garbage, criticizing them as worse than dog shit. The more they criticize, the more enthusiastic they become, the more they hate China's Khrushchev, and the more they love Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They are determined to forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever be good red guards for Chairman Mao, and in the struggle against the American-Kuomintang reactionaries, in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and in socialist construction, continuously achieve new merits!

　　站在阶级斗争最前线的小嶝岛民兵营
    在福建前线，有一个距离蒋匪军盘踞的金门岛只有三千来米远的英雄小岛——小嶝岛。
    每天早晨，随着岛上集合的阵阵海螺声，一群群荷枪实弹的男女民兵们，迎着万顷碧波托出的一轮红日，列队站在毛主席像前，放声高唱《东方红》，以无比深厚的无产阶级感情，衷心祝愿我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席万寿无疆！然后，他们学习毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，背诵林副主席的指示：念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。
    小嶝岛民兵营的民兵们，对伟大领袖毛主席心怀一个“忠”字，以百倍的警惕，和驻岛部队一起，日日夜夜战斗在海防线上，为保卫祖国，为保卫无产阶级文化大革命，作出了自己的贡献，成为福建前线活学活用毛泽东思想的先进集体。
　　永远握紧手中枪，当好毛主席的红哨兵
    伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，震撼了全世界。国内外一切阶级敌人，怕得要死，恨得要命，千方百计进行破坏。盘踞在金门岛的蒋匪帮，更是从各个方面进行捣乱。小嶝岛的民兵，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠诚和热爱，把保卫无产阶级文化大革命看成是自己的神圣职责，一分一秒也不放松对敌人的斗争。他们的战斗决心是：永远紧握手中枪，站在对敌斗争的最前线，当好毛主席的红哨兵。
    民兵们身在海岛，心向北京，胸怀全国。他们以能在小岛上为毛主席站岗放哨而感到自豪。在海边站岗巡逻，冬天海风刺骨，夏天蚊虫叮人。但是，民兵们一想到伟大领袖毛主席，冬冷夏热全不怕。他们坚守战斗岗位，一丝不苟。有一次，基干民兵洪意到附近一个小岛上支援部队施工，收工时驶往小嶝岛的最后一班交通艇已经开走了。部队同志再三劝他住一夜，可他不肯，说：“误了晚上一班岗，我就不配当毛主席的红哨兵。”他纵身跳进翻滚的大海，游渡过两千多米宽的海面，按时到达哨位。女民兵丘网看，已经嫁到大嶝岛。可是，她每次回娘家，总是到海边以前站惯了的哨位站上一班岗。有人问她：“网看，你现在是客人，为什么一回来都要站一站岗？”她说：“当好毛主席的红哨兵，是小嶝岛的传统。我人走了，忠于毛主席的心可没有走。”
    的确，当好毛主席的红哨兵这个传统，在小嶝岛上正一代一代地传下去。
    大队党支部书记、民兵营教导员洪秀丛，是小嶝岛的第一代民兵。多少个深沉的黑夜，她带领民兵们侦察过对面敌人的动静；多少个潮湿的黎明，她和民兵们一道，捕捉过偷渡的“水鬼”。从当民兵到当干部，从姑娘到结婚，已经十几年了，她从来没有脱离过战斗生活。她的坚强的信念是：生为保卫毛主席而战斗，死为保卫毛主席而献身。现在，她是四个孩子的妈妈了，还和过去一样，坚持站岗放哨。孩子们也早就养成了一种习惯：每当轮到洪秀丛站岗，就说：“妈妈，今晚该轮到咱们为毛主席站岗啦！”说着，乖乖地跟着妈妈走去。到了哨所，孩子们变得象个大人，既不吵又不闹，注意隐蔽自己，听从妈妈的指挥，瞪着机灵的小眼睛，观看四路，静听八方。有了一点动静，就向妈妈报告：“有敌情！”她的孩子们平时常常争着说长大了要挎妈妈用的枪，去保卫祖国。
    年近半百的老民兵洪木生，是个手执鱼叉，多次擒拿“水鬼”的老英雄。为了让自己的儿女早早接下“红哨兵”的班，前几年他常常带着儿子洪学雨到海边站岗，亲自教他怎样利用地形地物，怎样判断敌情。洪学雨刚够当民兵的年龄，洪木生就替儿子报名参加了民兵，并要求把他们父子编在一个班上。从此，父子俩并肩战斗，从来没有误过一次岗，被称为“父子铁岗哨”。去年，洪木生的眼睛不大好使了，组织上劝他退了队，可他又主动替刚够民兵年龄的女儿洪丽珠申请入队，并要求党支部批准把自己用过的枪亲自传给他的女儿。洪丽珠被批准入队后，他带领学雨和丽珠来到面对金门的海滩，把两本《毛主席语录》和他用过的枪，亲自交给他俩，语重心长地对他们说：“我在这里整整站了十八年岗，从来没有疏忽过一次。为了保卫毛主席，我真不愿放下这支枪，可是眼睛不行了。现在，要把这支枪交给你们，把保卫毛主席、保卫祖国的责任交给你们。你们可千万不能让这支枪生锈，让敌人从这儿爬上来！”在父亲的鼓励下，学雨、丽珠热血沸腾地当场表示：“我们坚决保证，象爸爸那样，永远做一个毛主席的红哨兵！”
　　日夜守卫海防线，在文化大革命中立新功
    盘踞在金门岛上的蒋介石匪军，把小嶝岛看作是眼中钉，肉中刺，一刻也没有停止过对它的破坏和捣乱。十几年来，敌人向这座不到一平方公里的小岛上，打了七万多发炮弹，岛上没有一间房屋不被打坏过，没有一块土地上没有弹坑。但是，英雄的小嶝岛民兵，房子倒了，再盖；庄稼毁了，再种；敌人白天来，白天打；夜晚来，夜晚打，始终坚持同敌人进行针锋相对的斗争，没有让过一步，给了敌人以沉重的打击，取得了一次又一次的胜利。
    一个细雨蒙蒙的夜晚，有一股美蒋武装特务，向小嶝岛方向偷袭。民兵们一接到敌情通报，立刻弹上膛，刀出鞘，飞速奔向滩头，控制了沃口、码头和海面。当时的女民兵班长丘网看，率领着弟弟荣和、芋果和女民兵许芬丽、周美续等，飞速跑到炮兵阵地，帮助部队拉开炮架，搬运炮弹，装上药包，一口气打了十八发照明弹，把海面照得通亮，使敌人无处藏身。顿时，各个阵地一齐向敌人猛烈开火，把敌人打得伤的伤，亡的亡。有几个敌人企图掉头溜掉，可是早被民兵副营长洪金满和老民兵洪马超等六人开出去的船截住退路，最后只好当了“红哨兵”手下的俘虏。几年来，小嶝岛的民兵们，就这样机智勇敢地捕获了几十名美蒋特务，为保卫祖国，保卫无产阶级文化大革命作出了贡献。
    敌人一面向小嶝岛进行军事挑衅，一面还耍起政治欺骗的把戏。金门岛上的广播站从一个增加到三个，破喇叭从几个增加到二十几个，从早到晚，不断播送从美帝、苏修那里拣来的陈词滥调，民兵们非常气愤，决心给敌人的造谣污蔑以严厉的回击。
    反击敌人的最强大的武器，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。敌人越是反对无产阶级文化大革命，民兵们越要把毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命取得节节胜利的消息，送到敌占岛上去。
    为了压倒金门岛上敌人的破喇叭，小嶝岛的民兵们和驻岛部队一起，合办了毛泽东思想宣传站，架设起强大有力的高音喇叭，日夜播送文化大革命取得伟大胜利的消息。同时，还用打宣传弹、放风筝等办法，把一批批闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的宣传品，撒向金门。
    今年春节前夕，民兵们接到一批上面印着我们伟大领袖毛主席亲切接见红卫兵照片的宣传品。大家十分高兴，都想及早把这批宣传品送到敌岛上去。不巧，那天海面上的风向不对，放风筝不合适。民兵营长周谋荣、基干民兵丘资和、许维翰，就驾船出航，到敌占岛屿附近去放。他们怀着战斗的激情，顶风斗浪，把船开到金门岛附近，等到连敌人的狗牙旗、碉堡眼都看清楚了，他们才顺水放了宣传品。顿时，在四百多米长的海面上，出现了数不清的塑料球一齐漂向金门岛的壮丽场面。敌人还没有来得及发现他们的船，他们已经胜利返航了。
    今年春节，福建前线炮兵领导机关宣布停止炮击两天，让金门同胞和蒋军官兵度春节。平时不敢露头的蒋军士兵，这时都从地洞里出来了。民兵们认为，这是一个宣传的好机会。民兵营政工组长张金照就带领几个民兵，挑了一个最大的风筝，走到海滩上。他们的风筝腾空而起，直奔金门，不偏不倚，刚好落在金门岛马山顶上的一支旗杆上。风筝一落，一幅巨大的红色标语立刻展开，象高高升起的一面红旗，上面写着二十四个金光闪闪的大字：“伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席万岁！万万岁！”金门同胞不顾敌人的阻拦，奔向马山，仰望红色的标语，久久不想走开。看到这个情景，民兵们个个拍手叫好！
    两年来，小嶝岛的民兵们共向金门岛送去了四十四万多份宣传品。这些宣传品在敌人的心脏里开花，给了金门同胞以巨大的鼓舞。
    上炮打美蒋，下炮批《修养》，把革命大批判的烈火烧得更旺
    小嶝岛的民兵们，牢记伟大领袖毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，在无产阶级文化大革命中，向一小撮不拿枪的阶级敌人展开了激烈的斗争。他们说：“在我们面前有两种敌人，一种是拿枪的美蒋反动派，一种是不拿枪的党内一小撮走资派以及受他们支持和保护的国民党反动派的残渣余孽。对这两种敌人我们绝不能施行仁政。”他们提出了“上炮打美蒋，下炮批《修养》”的战斗口号，狠批猛斗不拿枪的一小撮阶级敌人。
    革命大批判的怒涛，以盖过东海激浪的气势，在小嶝岛上展开了。在哨所、阵地，在田间、渔场，民兵们处处摆下了革命大批判的战场，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义谬论。
    革命大批判的战斗号角一响，民兵们首先向中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论、“剥削有功”论猛烈开火。在炮击金门的战斗中，亲自送儿子上火线，三次到阵地鼓舞儿子英勇战斗，要儿子“立不了战功别回来见娘”的支前模范、贫农张柑老大娘，在革命大批判会上，她怀着对中国赫鲁晓夫的无比仇恨，愤怒地说：“在万恶的旧社会，我的丈夫下海捕鱼，被日本侵略军打死，买不起棺材，把墙板拆下来做棺材；我的儿子饿得没法，冒着大风大浪出海捕鱼，一去就没有回来；我的婆婆病了没有钱请医生，死了三天没有埋葬，这就是我们穷人受剥削的血泪史。中国赫鲁晓夫说‘剥削有功’，这是对谁有功？这是对地主、资本家、渔霸有功。说‘剥削是救人’，救什么人？是救国民党反动派，救地、富、反、坏、右。对面就是公开的敌人，隐蔽的敌人还存在，这叫‘阶级斗争熄灭’了吗？中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命谬论，就是想把我们拉回旧社会，走资本主义老路，受二遍苦，我们贫下中农决不答应。我们要坚决打倒中国赫鲁晓夫！”
    现在，革命大批判的烈火，在小嶝岛上越烧越旺。民兵们剥开中国赫鲁晓夫的画皮，对他的反革命修正主义谬论进行了反复批判，把他推行的“三自一包”、“四大自由”、“公私溶化”论等反革命修正主义黑货，批得比狗屎还臭。民兵们越批劲头越大，越批对中国赫鲁晓夫越恨，对毛主席、对毛泽东思想、对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线越爱。他们决心永远忠于毛主席，永远当好毛主席的红哨兵，在打击美蒋反动派的斗争中，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，在社会主义建设中，不断建立新功！
