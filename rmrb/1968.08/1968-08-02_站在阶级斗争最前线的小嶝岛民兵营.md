Every morning, as the sound of conch shells echoes across the island, groups of armed male and female militia members gather, facing the rising sun over the vast blue sea. They stand in formation in front of Chairman Mao's portrait and sing "The East Is Red" with deep proletarian emotions, sincerely wishing our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman, Chairman Mao, eternal life! Then, they study Chairman Mao's teachings on never forgetting class struggle and recite Vice Chairman Lin's instructions: always remember class struggle, always remember the dictatorship of the proletariat, always prioritize politics, and always hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

The militia members of Xiaoyang Island are loyal to our great leader Chairman Mao. With heightened vigilance, they stand guard alongside the stationed troops day and night on the coastal defense line, contributing to the defense of the motherland and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They have become an advanced collective in the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought on the front lines of Fujian.

Forever Hold Tight the Guns in Our Hands, Be Good Red Guards for Chairman Mao

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, has shaken the world. All class enemies, both domestic and foreign, are terrified and enraged, trying every means to sabotage it. The Kuomintang bandits stationed on Jinmen Island are particularly disruptive from all angles. The militia on Xiaoyang Island, with unwavering loyalty and love for our great leader Chairman Mao, regard defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as their sacred duty. They never relax their vigilance against the enemy for a single moment. Their battle resolve is: forever hold tight the guns in our hands, stand at the forefront of the struggle against the enemy, and be good red guards for Chairman Mao.

The militia members, though stationed on the island, have their hearts in Beijing and their minds on the nation. They are proud to stand guard for Chairman Mao on this small island. Standing guard and patrolling by the sea, they endure the biting cold winds in winter and the biting insects in summer. But whenever they think of our great leader Chairman Mao, they fear neither the winter cold nor the summer heat. They diligently guard their posts without the slightest negligence. Once, a core militia member, Hong Yi, went to a nearby small island to support the construction of the troops. When it was time to return to Xiaoyang Island, the last transport boat had already left. The troops repeatedly urged him to stay the night, but he refused, saying, "If I miss the night shift, I am not worthy of being a red guard for Chairman Mao." He jumped into the rolling sea and swam across more than two thousand meters of water to arrive at the guard post on time. Female militia member Qiu Wangkan, who had married to Dajian Island, always went to her familiar guard post by the sea whenever she visited her parents. Someone asked her, "Wangkan, you are a guest now, why do you always stand guard when you come back?" She replied, "Being a good red guard for Chairman Mao is a tradition of Xiaoyang Island. Although I have left, my loyalty to Chairman Mao remains."

Indeed, the tradition of being good red guards for Chairman Mao is being passed down from generation to generation on Xiaoyang Island.

The party branch secretary and militia camp instructor of the production brigade, Hong Xiucong, is the first generation of militia on Xiaoyang Island. Countless deep nights, she led the militia to scout the enemy's movements across the strait; countless damp dawns, she and the militia together captured infiltrating "sea ghosts." From being a militia member to a cadre, from a young girl to a married woman, it has been more than a decade, and she has never left the battlefield. Her firm belief is: to live is to fight for Chairman Mao, to die is to sacrifice for Chairman Mao. Now, she is a mother of four children, and she still insists on standing guard as before. Her children have also developed a habit: whenever it is Hong Xiucong's turn to stand guard, they say, "Mom, it's our turn to stand guard for Chairman Mao tonight!" Saying this, they obediently follow their mother. Arriving at the guard post, the children become like adults, neither noisy nor disruptive, hiding themselves, following their mother's orders, and watching all around. If there is any movement, they report to their mother, "There is enemy activity!" Her children often compete to say that when they grow up, they will carry their mother's gun to defend the motherland.

Nearly fifty-year-old veteran militia member Hong Musheng is an old hero who wields a spear and has captured many "sea ghosts." To pass on the baton of the "red guard" to his children, a few years ago, he often took his son Hong Xueyu to the sea to stand guard, personally teaching him how to use the terrain and how to judge enemy movements. When Hong Xueyu was old enough to join the militia, Hong Musheng enrolled his son and requested that they be assigned to the same platoon. Since then, father and son have fought side by side, never missing a single shift, and are known as the "father-son iron guard post." Last year, Hong Musheng's eyesight began to fail, and the organization persuaded him to retire, but he voluntarily applied for his daughter Hong Lijiu, who had just reached the age to join the militia, to join and requested that the party branch approve the transfer of his gun to his daughter. After Hong Lijiu was approved to join, he led Xueyu and Lijiu to the beach facing Jinmen, handing them two copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and his used gun, and solemnly told them, "I have stood guard here for eighteen years without ever being negligent. For the sake of Chairman Mao, I really do not want to put down this gun, but my eyesight is failing. Now, I have to pass this gun to you, passing on the responsibility of defending Chairman Mao and the motherland to you. You must never let this gun rust and let the enemy climb up from here!" Encouraged by their father, Xueyu and Lijiu enthusiastically declared on the spot, "We firmly guarantee that we will be good red guards for Chairman Mao, just like our father!"

Day and Night Guarding the Coastal Defense Line, Achieving New Merits in the Cultural Revolution

The Kuomintang bandits stationed on Jinmen Island regard Xiaoyang Island as a thorn in their side, a constant irritation, and have never stopped trying to sabotage and disrupt it. Over the past decade, the enemy has fired more than seventy thousand shells at this island of less than one square kilometer, not a single house has escaped damage, and not a single piece of land is without shell craters. However, the heroic militia of Xiaoyang Island, when their houses are destroyed, they rebuild; when their crops are ruined, they replant; when the enemy comes during the day, they fight during the day; when the enemy comes at night, they fight at night, always maintaining a head-on struggle with the enemy without giving an inch, dealing heavy blows to the enemy and achieving one victory after another.

One rainy night, a group of American-Kuomintang armed special forces attempted to sneak attack Xiaoyang Island. As soon as the militia received the enemy alert, they immediately loaded their guns, drew their swords, and rushed to the beach, controlling the shallows, the dock, and the sea. At that time, the female militia platoon leader Qiu Wangkan led her younger brother Hong Ronghe, Yu Guo, and female militia members Xu Fenli and Zhou Meixu to quickly run to the artillery position, helping the troops set up the gun carriage, transport artillery shells, load the gunpowder bags, and fired eighteen illuminating shells in one breath, illuminating the sea surface brightly, leaving the enemy nowhere to hide. Immediately, all positions opened fire on the enemy, wounding and killing many. A few enemy soldiers attempted to retreat, but they were already blocked by the militia deputy camp commander Hong Jinshan and veteran militia member Hong Mashao and five others who had gone out in boats, and finally became prisoners under the "red guards."

Over the years, the militia of Xiaoyang Island have thus captured dozens of American-Kuomintang special forces, contributing to the defense of the motherland and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

While militarily provoking Xiaoyang Island, the enemy also plays political deception. The broadcasting stations on Jinmen Island increased from one to three, and the broken loudspeakers increased from a few to more than twenty, broadcasting from early morning to late night the worn-out clich√©s picked up from the Americans and the Soviet revisionists. The militia members were very angry and decided to give a stern rebuke to the enemy's slander and lies.

The most powerful weapon to counter the enemy is the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. The more the enemy opposes the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the more the militia members must ensure that the news of the great victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, reaches the enemy-occupied island.

To drown out the enemy's broken loudspeakers on Jinmen Island, the militia of Xiaoyang Island, together with the stationed troops, jointly set up a Mao Zedong Thought propaganda station, installing powerful loudspeakers that broadcast the news of the great victories of the Cultural Revolution day and night. At the same time, they also use artillery shells and kites to scatter batches of propaganda materials shining with the light of Mao Zedong Thought towards Jinmen.

Before the Spring Festival this year, the militia received a batch of propaganda materials with photographs of our great leader Chairman Mao warmly receiving the Red Guards. Everyone was very happy and wanted to send this batch of propaganda materials to the enemy island as soon as possible. Unfortunately, that day the wind direction on the sea was not suitable for flying kites. The militia camp commander Zhou Mourong, core militia members Qiu Ziyang and Xu Weihan, took a boat out to sea near the enemy-occupied island to fly the kites. With fighting spirit, they braved the wind and waves, driving the boat to the vicinity of Jinmen Island. When they could clearly see the enemy's dog-tooth flags and fort eyes, they released the propaganda materials with the current. Suddenly, on a four-hundred-meter-long sea surface, countless plastic balls floated towards Jinmen Island, presenting a magnificent scene. The enemy had not yet discovered their boat, and they had already returned victorious.

This Spring Festival, the artillery leadership of the Fujian front announced a two-day suspension of artillery fire to allow the people of Jinmen and the Kuomintang soldiers to celebrate the Spring Festival. Usually, the Kuomintang soldiers dare not come out, but at this time, they all came out of their underground holes. The militia members saw this as a good opportunity for propaganda. The political work leader of the militia camp, Zhang Jinzhao, led a few militia members to the beach with the largest kite. Their kite soared into the sky, straight towards Jinmen, and landed precisely on a flagpole on the top of Mashan on Jinmen Island. As soon as the kite landed, a giant red banner immediately unfolded, like a high-flying red flag, with twenty-four golden words: "Long live, long, long live our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao!" The people of Jinmen, despite the enemy's obstruction, rushed to Mashan, gazing at the red banner, reluctant to leave. Seeing this scene, the militia members all clapped their hands in approval!

Over the past two years, the militia of Xiaoyang Island have sent more than four hundred and forty thousand propaganda materials to Jinmen Island. These propaganda materials have bloomed in the enemy's heart, greatly encouraging the people of Jinmen.

Firing Cannons at the Americans and the Kuomintang, Firing Cannons at "Cultivation," Burning the Fiery Torch of Revolutionary Criticism Even Higher

The militia of Xiaoyang Island firmly remember the great teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao to never forget class struggle. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they have launched a fierce struggle against a handful of class enemies who do not carry guns. They say, "In front of us, there are two kinds of enemies: one is the armed American-Kuomintang reactionaries, and the other is the handful of capitalist roaders within the party and the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries supported and protected by them. We must not show mercy to these two kinds of enemies." They have put forward the battle slogan of "firing cannons at the Americans and the Kuomintang, firing cannons at 'Cultivation,'" fiercely criticizing and fighting against the handful of class enemies who do not carry guns.

The angry waves of revolutionary criticism have surged across Xiaoyang Island with a momentum that surpasses the waves of the East China Sea. In the guard posts, battle positions, fields, and fishing grounds, the militia have set up battlefields for revolutionary criticism everywhere, fiercely criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies of China's Khrushchev.

As soon as the battle cry of revolutionary criticism sounded, the militia first launched a fierce attack on China's Khrushchev's "theory of the extinction of class struggle" and "theory of the merit of exploitation." In the battle of shelling Jinmen, the model of supporting the frontlines, poor peasant Zhang Gang's mother, personally sent her son to the frontlines, went to the battle positions three times to encourage her son to fight bravely, and told her son, "If you cannot achieve military merit, do not come back to see your mother." At the revolutionary criticism meeting, she said with great hatred for China's Khrushchev, "In the evil old society, my husband went fishing at sea and was killed by the Japanese invaders, and we could not afford a coffin, using the wall panels to make a coffin; my son was so hungry that he went fishing in the big winds and waves, and never came back; my mother-in-law fell ill and could not afford a doctor, and was not buried for three days after her death. This is the blood-stained history of our poor people being exploited. China's Khrushchev says 'exploitation is meritorious,' whose merit is this? This is the merit of the landlords, capitalists, and fish tyrants. Saying 'exploitation is salvation,' who is being saved? It is saving the Kuomintang reactionaries, saving the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. The open enemy is right in front of us, and the hidden enemy still exists. This is called 'the extinction of class struggle'? China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary fallacies are trying to drag us back to the old society, take the capitalist road, suffer twice, we poor and lower-middle peasants will never agree. We must resolutely overthrow China's Khrushchev!"

Now, the fiery torch of revolutionary criticism is burning even more fiercely on Xiaoyang Island. The militia have peeled off China's Khrushchev's mask, repeatedly criticized his counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies, and criticized his "three freedoms and one contract," "four freedoms," and "public-private fusion" theory and other counter-revolutionary revisionist garbage, criticizing them as worse than dog shit. The more they criticize, the more enthusiastic they become, the more they hate China's Khrushchev, and the more they love Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They are determined to forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever be good red guards for Chairman Mao, and in the struggle against the American-Kuomintang reactionaries, in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and in socialist construction, continuously achieve new merits!
