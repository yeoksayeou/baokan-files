I was originally an ordinary postal worker. After joining the county revolutionary committee's leadership team, at first, I often found time to go to the post office to work. However, later on, I gradually stopped caring about it, sometimes even feeling it was a burden. I thought, work is so busy, and I am so tired, forget it, I'll go back later when I have time.

Chairman Mao issued his latest directive: "The revolutionary committee should implement unified leadership, break down redundant administrative structures, streamline and reduce personnel, and organize a revolutionary leadership team that is connected with the masses." Chairman Mao's great directive is like a guiding light, illuminating my mind and eyes. I thought, I am a representative of a revolutionary mass organization. If I separate myself from labor, how can I be a representative of the masses? Thus, I made up my mind that no matter how busy the work is or how tired I am, I must insist on going to work regularly. In the past, I was a postal worker, a servant of the people. Today, my position has changed, but I am still a servant of the people. The value of a servant lies in the word "diligence." The essence of an ordinary laborer must never change.

From then on, as long as I was working in the county, I often returned to the post office to work, and together with my comrades, I promoted revolution and production. No matter what task, sorting mail, delivering mail, operating the switchboard, cleaning, or sweeping the toilets, I did it all. This way, I became even closer to my comrades. When I went to the lower levels, I worked with the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses, propagated Mao Zedong Thought to them, had heart-to-heart talks with them, learned from them, and humbly became a student of the masses.

In working with the masses, I received a lot of education. Once, I went to Changgang Commune to work and learned that our great leader Chairman Mao, when he was in Changgang Township, saw a small wooden bridge by the bamboo grove at the village entrance was broken, and instructed the village cadres to think of the people in everything, and to repair the bridge quickly if it was broken. Later, when Chairman Mao returned to Ruijin, he wrote a letter to the township Soviet government asking if the small bridge had been repaired. Truly, parents are not as kind as Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao cares the most about the people and is heart to heart with them, even thinking of the small matters of the people walking across the bridge. I decided to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, take Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice as a shining example, and always think of the people and care for the people, becoming a confidant of the people.

After I joined the county revolutionary committee's leadership work, some comrades saw me coming and going to work and attend meetings in windy and rainy weather, finding it inconvenient, and cleared a relatively good room for me in the original county committee's compound, asking me to move in. I thought, I am a servant of the people, my position has changed, but my frugal and plain style cannot change. Living in the post office, although the room is a bit worse and smaller, going to the revolutionary committee to work requires walking a bit more, sometimes even enduring wind and rain; but this is exactly what can help me get rid of my pampered habits, maintain the essence of the working people, and always be heart to heart with the masses. Therefore, I declined the suggestion to move.

"The good style of the Soviet area cadres, bringing their own food to work, wearing straw shoes to revolutionize, walking mountain paths with lanterns at night." The revolutionary predecessors have left us a revolutionary legacy. I decided to take the revolutionary predecessors as my example, like them, with a red heart forever loyal to Chairman Mao, forever maintaining the essence of an ordinary laborer, and be a servant of the people for life.

　　贵在一个“勤”字
　　江西省兴国县革命委员会副主任　徐桂英
    我本来是一个普普通通的邮电员，参加县革委会的领导班子以后，开头我还经常挤时间到邮局去上班。但是，后来渐渐地就不把这事放在心上了，有时甚至感到是个负担。我心想，工作这么忙，人这么累，算了吧，以后有空再去。
    毛主席发出最新指示：“革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”毛主席的伟大指示，象一盏指路明灯，照得我心明眼亮。我想，我是一个革命群众组织的代表，如果脱离了劳动还算什么群众代表？于是，我下定决心，工作再忙，人再累，也要坚持定期上班。过去，我当邮电员是人民的勤务员，今天职务变了，还是人民的勤务员。勤务员就贵在一个“勤”字上，普通劳动者的本色永远不能变。
    从此以后，只要我是在县里工作，都经常回邮电局上班，和同志们一道抓革命促生产。不管什么活，拣信、送信、守总机、搞卫生、扫厕所，我都干。这样，我和同志们就更加亲密了。到下面去的时候，就和贫下中农及革命群众一块劳动，向他们宣传毛泽东思想，和他们谈心，向他们学习，甘当群众的小学生。
    在同群众一起劳动中，我受到了不少教育。一次到长冈公社劳动，了解到伟大领袖毛主席当年在长冈乡调查，看到村口竹林旁一座小木桥坏了，就教导村干部要处处为群众着想，桥坏了要赶快修好。后来，毛主席回到瑞金，还写信给乡苏维埃政府，问小桥修好了没有。真是爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲！毛主席最关心群众，和群众心连心，连群众走路过桥的小事都想到了。我决心遵照毛主席的教导，以毛主席的伟大革命实践为光辉榜样，时时刻刻想到群众，关心群众，做群众的知心人。
    我参加县革委会的领导工作以后，有的同志看到我在刮风下雨的天气里来去上班、开会，不方便，就在原县委院里给我腾了一间比较好的房子，要我搬去住。我想，我是人民的勤务员，地位变了，艰苦朴素的作风不能变。在邮电局住，虽然房子差一点，小一点，到革委会上班要多走点路，有时还要受风吹雨淋；但这正好能使我磨掉娇气，保持劳动人民的本色，和群众永远心连心。因此，我谢绝了让我搬房子的意见。
    “苏区干部好作风，自带干粮去办公，日着草鞋干革命，夜走山路打灯笼。”革命的前辈们，给我们后一代留下了革命的传家宝。我决心以革命前辈为榜样，象他们那样一颗红心永远忠于毛主席，永远保持普通劳动者的本色，当一辈子人民的勤务员。
