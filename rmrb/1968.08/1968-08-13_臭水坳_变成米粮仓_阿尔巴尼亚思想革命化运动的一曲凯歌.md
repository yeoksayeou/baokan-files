In the triumphant songs of Albania's thought revolution, the youth of the Gradište Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Elbasan District have displayed revolutionary heroism, transforming a 25-hectare marshland, long known as the "stinking swamp," into a fertile granary.

The Gradište Agricultural Production Cooperative is located in the central part of Albania. There is a 25-hectare marshland here, surrounded by mountains on all sides, with water accumulating year-round, mosquitoes breeding, and overgrown with weeds. People have long called it the "stinking swamp."

Old-timers living near the "stinking swamp" tell a tale from many years ago. A boy who was herding cattle accidentally let his cow run away. The cow dashed towards a cave near the "stinking swamp" and never came out. The poor herdboy chased after it into the cave but also never emerged. The boy's father, frantic, rushed into the cave to find his son but met the same fate. This ancient legend was later used by the church for deceptive propaganda, adding a layer of mystery to the "stinking swamp." For generations, people have passed down the story, calling the mountain the "Ghost Mountain" and daring not to touch a single stone or clod of earth on it.

In November 1966, at the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour of Albania, the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, delivered an important report, pushing the nationwide thought revolution to new heights. The Land of the Eagles was in a state of excitement.

"The towering mountains of our country will not only be a natural barrier for defending the motherland but also an important source for developing our socialist economy," Hoxha said. "Our current barren mountains will soon become fertile lands. The earth will be beautified by man, and the mountains will be transformed by man's hands and wisdom." Comrade Hoxha issued a great call to arms to the Albanian people and youth to change the heavens and the earth. The members of the Gradište Agricultural Production Cooperative, like the people across the nation, studied Comrade Hoxha's report over and over again. The youth were particularly excited and held lively discussions at the League of Working Youth branch meetings. One youth firmly declared, "Comrades, let us drain the 'stinking swamp' with our own hands and turn it into fertile fields. This will be our best practical response to the Party's call!" The youth's speech was met with thunderous applause, and they unanimously decided: Transform the "stinking swamp" into fertile land and grow good crops!

There were seven of them. They planned to dig a drainage ditch at the foot of the "Ghost Mountain" to divert the water from the "stinking swamp" to the back of the hill.

To make the "Ghost Mountain" bow its head was something that previous generations had never dared to think of. The youth knew that to complete this project, they would definitely encounter various difficulties and setbacks, but they thought more about how to add 25 hectares of land to the motherland and increase grain production for the motherland. When they thought of Comrade Hoxha's call at the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour, their confidence in victory was even stronger. On a December morning, seven fearless warriors, shoulder to shoulder with shovels and picks, set off towards the "stinking swamp" with full confidence.

Work began. They first dug a two-meter-deep pit and then started to excavate the drainage ditch leading to the center of the hill. The pit was very narrow, and only one person could work inside, bending over. The strong youth, Kambel, was the first to jump down. Half an hour later, he climbed out, gasping for breath, his face pale.

"What happened?" everyone anxiously asked.

"I don't know what's wrong, but down there, my chest feels tight, and I keep wanting to vomit." He slowly walked to a large rock and leaned against it. The other six comrades looked at him with concern. After a while, the youth stood up again, but his head was still dizzy, and beads of sweat trickled down his forehead.

Then, Dhema went down. After about twenty minutes, he also climbed out, gasping for breath, his face pale. Everyone still looked at him with doubt and helped him to a large rock.

The seven of them gathered together, pondering: What was going on? It turned out that the rocks had been eroded over the years, filling the underground with carbon dioxide. Working underground for a short time would cause dizziness, but breathing fresh air on the surface for a while would restore one's spirits. However, the youth, due to lack of experience, did not know this at the time.

What to do? Should they stop working just because of a minor accident? The youth recalled the scene from the League of Working Youth branch meeting the night before, and the superstitions about the "stinking swamp" echoed in their ears. Each of them thought: If the original plan fails, it means surrendering to feudal superstition and old habits, which means the "stinking swamp" is unconquerable. No! Under the guidance of the Party of Labour of Albania, the Albanian youth with a glorious revolutionary tradition have no difficulty they cannot overcome!

Bitrit knew that he would also encounter the same difficulties, but he resolutely jumped down. Half an hour later, he came out, just like his comrades, resting by the rocks for a while before continuing. The seven of them decided to carry on. They took turns every half hour. Soon, the drainage ditch had dug two meters into the "Ghost Mountain."

More than a month passed, and it became even colder, with biting winds adding to their difficulties. However, they still worked as usual, going in and out of the narrow, dark trench, laughing and working together to transport soil and stones out. The drainage ditch extended from over fifty meters to over a hundred meters. To speed up the transportation of soil and stones to the surface, the youth made a handcart themselves, thus increasing the speed.

The youth, after overcoming various difficulties, became even more tenacious. Their heroic deeds moved the entire village. Some elderly people, previously influenced by feudal superstitions, watched as the legendary "Ghost Mountain" was gradually conquered and could not help but praise them. Other young people in the cooperative, inspired by them, also organized themselves to start building the irrigation ditch from the "stinking swamp" to the drainage ditch to divert the water.

Another month passed, and the drainage ditch had been dug to two hundred meters, although it was still far from the back of the mountain, but the youth did not lose heart at all. One day, as they were digging, a large rock suddenly collapsed in front of them. The first person to go up saw a cold breeze and heard the sound of flowing water in the distance. It turned out to be an underground water channel flowing here. The youth were overjoyed: as long as the drainage ditch was connected to the underground water channel, the water in the "stinking swamp" could flow away.

At this time, the irrigation ditch from the "stinking swamp" to the drainage ditch had also been completed. Thus, the stagnant water in the "stinking swamp" broke its long silence and began to flow slowly into the drainage ditch. The youth were so happy that they sang and danced, looking at the twenty-five hectares of fertile black soil seeing the sunlight... What a joyous moment! The "stinking swamp" was finally conquered!

In the autumn of 1967, this land contributed its first batch of grain to the motherland. The members harvested a thousand dan of corn from the former "stinking swamp."

The story of the Gradište youth transforming the "stinking swamp" spread. Albanian youth across the nation launched a widespread campaign to open up wastelands and increase grain production. Tens of thousands of volunteer laborers responded enthusiastically to the Party's call, venturing into remote mountainous areas to reclaim land with the cooperative members, undergoing tempering, and more advanced collectives and model figures emerged. By the last year of the Fourth Five-Year Plan (1970), the country would add 115,000 hectares of new land, equivalent to 42% of all arable land in Albania before World War II. As they worked, they sang proudly:

With a pickaxe in one hand and a gun in the other,
We labor bravely, building our motherland.
Make the rivers give way,
Turn barren mountains into granaries.
Sing of our beloved leader Enver,
Sing of the glorious and strong Party of Labour...

　　“臭水坳”变成米粮仓
　　——阿尔巴尼亚思想革命化运动的一曲凯歌
    在阿尔巴尼亚思想革命化运动的凯歌声中，爱尔巴桑区格拉迪什特农业生产合作社的青年，发扬革命的英雄气概，把世世代代被人们称为“臭水坳”的二十五公顷沼泽地，改造成为富饶的粮仓。
    爱尔巴桑区的格拉迪什特农业生产合作社在阿尔巴尼亚的中部。这里有一块占地二十五公顷的沼泽地，四面环山，终年积水，蚊虫滋生，长满杂草，人们把它称为“臭水坳”。
    住在靠近“臭水坳”的老年人传说，很多年以前，一个放牛的孩子不小心把牛放跑了。那头牛直朝着“臭水坳”旁边的山洞里跑去，再也没有出来。可怜的放牛娃紧追到山洞里，可他也没有能够走出洞外。孩子的父亲急得没法，赶紧跑到山洞里去寻找自己的儿子，但也落得了和孩子同样的命运。这个古老的传说后来又被教会用来进行欺骗宣传，使“臭水坳”更加蒙上了一层神秘的色彩。多少年人们世代相传，称这座山叫“鬼山”，不敢去动一动山上的石和土。
    一九六六年十一月，在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会上，阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志作了重要报告，把正在全国轰轰烈烈开展的革命化运动推向了新的高潮。山鹰之国一片沸腾。
      “我国巍峨的群山将不仅是保卫祖国的天然屏障，而且是发展我国社会主义经济的重要源泉。”“我国目前的穷山恶土，在不久的将来就会变成富山沃土。大地要靠人来美化，高山要靠人的双手和智慧来改造。”霍查同志向阿尔巴尼亚人民和青年发出了改天换地的伟大战斗号召。格拉迪什特农业生产合作社社员们和全国人民一样，一遍又一遍地认真学习霍查同志的报告。青年们尤其激动，他们在劳动青年联盟的支部会议上展开了热烈的讨论。有个青年坚定地说：“同志们，用我们的双手把‘臭水坳’排干，把它改造成良田，这就是我们响应党的号召的最好的实际行动！”小伙子的发言博得了全场热烈的掌声，青年们一致决定：改造“臭水坳”，种出好庄稼！
    他们一共是七个人。他们计划在“鬼山”脚下挖一条排水沟，把“臭水坳”的水引到山丘的背面去。
    要叫“鬼山”低头，这可是前人从不敢想的事情。青年们知道，要完成这项工程，一定会遇到各种困难和挫折，但是他们想得更多的是怎样为祖国增添二十五公顷土地，为祖国增产更多的粮食。当他们想到霍查同志在劳动党第五次代表大会上的号召时，更加坚定了胜利的信心。十二月的一个清晨，七个无畏的战士肩扛铁铲、镢头等工具，满怀信心地向“臭水坳”进发。
    开始动工了。他们首先挖开了一个两米深的坑，然后着手开凿通向山丘中心的排水沟。坑下地方很小，只能一个人弯着腰工作。壮小伙子坎贝尔第一个跳了下去。半个小时过后，他气喘吁吁地爬出地面，脸色苍白。
    “怎么搞的？”大家焦虑地问。
    “我也弄不清是怎么回事，在下面一会儿心口就憋得厉害，老是想吐。”他慢慢地走到一块大石头旁边，斜倚在那里。其他六个战友关怀地看着他。过了不久，小伙子又站了起来，但头还是有点晕，额上直冒汗珠。
    这时捷马尔下去了。过了二十分钟左右，他也和坎贝尔一样地爬了上来，也是气喘，脸色苍白。大家还是用疑虑的目光看着他，把他搀到一块大石旁边。
    七个人围拢在一起思索起来：这究竟是怎么回事？原来这是因为山岩经年太久，腐蚀过后，使地下充满了二氧化碳，在地下工作时间稍久就会头晕，只要再到地面呼吸一阵新鲜空气，休息一会儿，就能恢复精神。可是青年们由于没有经验，当时并不知道这个道理。
    怎么办？就因为出了一点意外的事故而停工吗？青年们回想起前一天晚上劳动青年联盟支部开会的情景，那些关于“臭水坳”的迷信传说重又回响在耳际。他们每个人都在想：如果让原订的计划落空，那就是向封建迷信和旧习惯势力低头，那就是说“臭水坳”是不可征服的。不！在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党教育下，有着光荣革命传统的阿尔巴尼亚青年没有什么困难不可克服！
    比特里特明知道他下去也会遇到同样的困难，但他毅然地跳了下去。半个小时后，他同战友们一样，走到地面上，躺在岩石边休息一会，准备再干。七个人就这样下定决心干下去。他们每隔半个小时轮换一次。很快，排水沟就向“鬼山”中央掘进两米多远。
    一个多月过去了，天更冷了，刺骨的寒风增加了他们工作的困难。但是他们还和往常一样，早出晚归，从狭窄而阴暗的坑道里钻进去，爬出来，有说有笑，同心协力地向外运送土石。排水沟从五十多米长增加到一百多米远了。为了更快地往地面运送土块和石头，青年们就自己动手制作了一部手推车，这样，速度加快了。
    青年们经过各种困难的考验，变得更顽强了。他们的英雄行为感动了全村的群众，过去受封建迷信影响的一些老年人，眼看着传说中的“鬼山”渐渐被征服，情不自禁地称赞起来。社里其他的年青人在他们的带动下，也自动组织起来，开始修筑从“臭水坳”到排水沟之间的水渠，以便把水引走。
    又一个月过去了，排水沟已挖进二百米长，虽然离山的背面还有很远的距离，但是青年们丝毫没有泄气。一天，他们挖着挖着，前面突然陷下一块大石头，第一个人走上前去一看，一股冷气流迎面扑来，远处听到潺潺的流水声。原来是一条地下水道流经这里。青年们喜出望外：只要把排水沟同地下水道接通，“臭水坳”的水就可以流走了。
    这时，从“臭水坳”到排水沟之间的水渠也已修成了。于是“臭水坳”的积水打破了长年的沉寂，开始缓缓地向排水沟里流去。青年们高兴得又唱又跳，直望着那二十五公顷肥沃的黑土见到了阳光……多么欢乐的时刻啊！“臭水坳”终于被征服了！
    一九六七年的秋天，这块土地向祖国贡献出第一批粮食，社员们从昔日的“臭水坳”里收获了一千公担玉米。
    格拉迪什特青年改造“臭水坳”的事迹传开了。阿尔巴尼亚全国青年掀起了一个广泛开荒、增加粮食生产的热潮。数以万计的青年义务劳动者热烈响应党的号召，深入到遥远的山区，同合作社员们一起开荒，经受锻炼，更多的先进集体和模范人物涌现出来了。到第四个五年计划的最后一年（一九七○年），全国将增添十一万五千公顷的新地，这相当于阿尔巴尼亚在第二次世界大战前拥有的全部耕地的百分之四十二。人们一边劳动，一边豪迈地唱着：
    一手拿镐，一手拿枪，
    英勇劳动，建设祖国。
    叫河水让开路，
    让荒山变粮仓。
    歌唱敬爱的领袖恩维尔，
    歌唱光荣、坚强的劳动党……

    英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民在变沼泽地为良田方面作出了显著成绩。这是挖土机手在挖排水渠。
