The 25th of August was once again an extraordinary day, another sleepless night.

As soon as the night fell, the radio waves transmitted Chairman Mao's latest directive, and Qinghua Garden immediately buzzed with excitement. The comrades from the Capital Workers' Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team were so excited that their hearts seemed to leap out of their chests. All they could hear were the slogans "Long live Chairman Mao!" and "Long, long live Chairman Mao!" merging into a powerful wave that shook the sky above Qinghua Garden. Squad after squad, ecstatic with joy, held grand parades in Qinghua Garden. Somehow, they quickly printed Chairman Mao's latest directive, which fluttered down like snowflakes into the excited crowd. Slogans and propaganda posters celebrating Chairman Mao's latest directive were instantly plastered all over Qinghua Garden.

Drums beat joyous tunes, and firecrackers announced good news. Late at night, on the lawn square of Qinghua Garden, the Workers' Propaganda Team, PLA soldiers, and revolutionary faculty, staff, and students of Tsinghua University held a grand rally to enthusiastically celebrate the issuance of Chairman Mao's latest directive.

It was already past two in the morning on the 26th, and the Workers' Propaganda Team's third brigade was holding a lively discussion meeting.

	"Parents only love their own children, but Chairman Mao loves all the toiling people of the world." Beijing Crane Factory comrade Jin Fenghui rolled tears of happiness as he shared his thoughts on studying Chairman Mao's latest directive. In the old society, he had no home and no land, and he never dreamed he would have today. After liberation, from his personal experience, he understood that Chairman Mao is the great savior of the toiling people. He said excitedly: Chairman Mao not only saved us from the sea of suffering but also elevated the working class to the position of the leading class. He personally received us and even sent us mangoes. Today, Chairman Mao has called on us to lead the educational revolution. This is truly the greatest care, the greatest trust, the greatest encouragement, and the greatest inspiration!

	During the discussion meeting, comrades Xu Guoyuan from the People's Machinery Factory and Tao Zhenliang from the Beijing Metal Structure Factory expressed their deep agreement: In the old society, we were treated like cattle and horses, struggling day and night on the brink of death, and we never even thought that workers could become masters. Only under Chairman Mao's leadership did we achieve today's high status. The era when the working class had no right to participate in politics and no right to care about state affairs has passed.

	"We workers must lead everything. This is the great historical mission bestowed upon us by the times, and this is the glorious task entrusted to us by Chairman Mao." Comrade Tao Zhenliang said with revolutionary enthusiasm: "Our workers entering Tsinghua is not just to promote revolutionary great unity and the three-in-one combination. We will also participate in all the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation in the school and forever lead the school. The working class should and can lead the educational revolution and absolutely cannot allow the bourgeois intellectuals to control the power of higher education. We must completely reverse the history of bourgeois rule over higher education."

	The working class leading higher education is unprecedented in history. Can the "rough workers" manage those high-level intellectuals? Comrade Liu Qingkun from the Beijing Cutting Tool Factory talked about his process of changing his mind with joy. At first, when he was responsible for helping professors hold study classes, he was a bit worried that they had a higher cultural level and might ask questions he couldn't answer. But after a few days of practice, he saw through the essence of those so-called high-level intellectuals. When the study classes began, he called all the professors from their homes and organized them to study. They, however, proposed to study on the 1st, 3rd, and 5th days and go home on the 2nd, 4th, and 6th days. Comrade Liu Qingkun said, in our country, there is no such thing as eating the people's food without working. They said, however, that it was like that in the past, and they were not used to the change now. Comrade Liu Qingkun said, if you were not used to it in the past, you should get used to it now! The bourgeoisie has its system, and we proletarians have our system. Now it is the proletariat leading the school, so let the bourgeois system go to the garbage dump! Comrade Wang Zhenming from the Beijing Machine Tool Repair Factory also agreed, saying: As long as we have Mao Zedong Thought, we fear nothing. You have culture, you can speak, you can write, but you cannot write proletarian feelings or speak revolutionary truths. We may not have culture, but we have Mao Zedong Thought, and we can create miracles that those bourgeois lords dare not even think of. Let those absurd theories of "workers not understanding education" go to hell, the world is created by us!

	As the passionate speeches continued, time quietly slipped away. Everyone had a discussion meeting all night, but no one felt tired. Everyone looked at Chairman Mao's portrait with boundless affection. In the song "The party's favor is greater than the heavens and the earth, and Chairman Mao's love is greater than that of parents..." they welcomed a new day of struggle.

### 清华园的不眠之夜

    清华园的不眠之夜
    八月二十五日，又是一个不寻常的日子，又是一个不眠之夜。
    当夜幕刚刚降下的时候，无线电波传来了毛主席又一最新指示，清华园立刻沸腾了。首都工人毛泽东思想宣传队的同志们，激动得心都要蹦出来了。只听到“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万万岁！”的口号声，汇成一股强大的声浪，震动着清华园的上空。一支支欣喜若狂的队伍，在清华园里举行盛大游行。不知道他们用什么样的办法，神速地印好了毛主席的最新指示，雪片似地飞落到激动的人群里。欢呼毛主席最新指示发表的大幅标语和宣传画，霎时间贴满了清华园。
    锣鼓奏佳音，鞭炮报喜讯。深夜，在清华园草坪广场上，工人宣传队、解放军战士和清华大学的革命师生员工又联合举行盛大集会，最热烈地欢呼毛主席最新指示的发表。
    已经是二十六日凌晨两点多了，宣传队三团的老工人座谈会开得正火热。
      “父母只疼自己的儿女，毛主席疼的是咱全世界的劳苦人民”。北京起重机厂靳凤辉同志，滚动着幸福的热泪，畅谈他学习毛主席最新指示的体会。他在旧社会房无一间，地无一垄，压根儿就没想到会有今天。解放了，他从自己的亲身经历中，懂得了毛主席是劳苦人民的大救星。他激动地说：毛主席不但把我们从苦海里拯救出来，而且把我们工人阶级提高到领导阶级的地位上来。他老人家把芒果送给我们宣传队，并且亲自接见我们。今天，毛主席又叫我们领导教育革命。这真是对我们最大的关怀，最大的信任，最大的鞭策，最大的鼓舞啊！
    在座谈会上，人民机器厂老工人徐国垣和北京金属结构厂的陶振良深有同感地说：旧社会，我们当牛做马，日夜挣扎在死亡线上，连想也没有想到工人会当家做主人，只有在毛主席的领导下，我们才有今天这样高的地位。工人阶级无权过问政治，无权关心国家大事的时代一去不复返了。
      “我们工人阶级就是要领导一切。这是时代赋予我们的伟大历史使命，这是毛主席交给我们的光荣任务。”陶振良同志满怀着革命的豪情说：“我们工人进驻清华，决不仅仅是为了促进革命大联合和三结合，我们还要参加学校中全部斗、批、改任务，并且永远领导学校。我们工人阶级应该也能够领导教育革命，绝不能再让资产阶级知识分子把持高等学校的大权，一定要把资产阶级统治高等学校的历史彻底颠倒过来。”
    工人阶级要领导高等学校，这在历史上还是开天辟地第一次。工人“大老粗”，能管了那些高级知识分子吗？北京刃具厂刘清坤同志带着胜利的喜悦，谈了他这一段认识的转变过程。开始，他负责帮助教授办学习班时，还有点担心人家文化水平高，问起话来自己解释不了。但短短几天的实践，他看穿了那些所谓的高级知识分子的实质。开始办学习班了，他把那些教授们都从家里叫来，组织他们学习。他们却提出要一、三、五学习，二、四、六回家。刘清坤同志说，在我们国家那有吃着人民的饭不上班的道理。他们却说，过去就是这样，现在改了不习惯。刘清坤同志说，过去不习惯，现在就习惯习惯吧！资产阶级有资产阶级的制度，我们无产阶级有无产阶级的制度。现在是无产阶级领导学校，让资产阶级的制度到垃圾堆里去吧！北京机床修理一厂王振明同志也有同感地说：我们只要有了毛泽东思想，就一切都不怕。你有文化，你会说，你能写，但你写不出无产阶级感情来，说不出革命的道理来。我们没有文化，但我们有毛泽东思想，就能创造出一切资产阶级老爷们连想都不敢想的奇迹来。让那些“工人不懂教育”的奇谈怪论见鬼去吧，世界是我们创造的！
    随着热烈的发言，时间悄悄地溜走了。大家开了一夜的座谈会，可是谁也不觉得疲倦。人人怀着无限深情，望着毛主席画像。在“天大地大不如党的恩情大，爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲……”的歌声中，迎来了新的战斗的一天。
