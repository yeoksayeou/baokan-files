Newspaper reports that on the evening of the 15th, emotionally charged Malaysian people in the capital Kuala Lumpur and Penang, among other places, held demonstrations and marches to strongly protest the fascist actions of the Rahman puppet regime, which plotted to murder eleven Malaysian patriotic youth.

According to reports from Singapore, on the evening of the 15th, the central area of Kuala Lumpur and many other parts of the city saw large-scale protest demonstrations. Demonstrators held up placards and chanted slogans along the way, distributing leaflets to condemn the Rahman puppet regime's heinous crime of plotting to murder Malaysian youth.

Outside the Kuala Lumpur Pudu Prison, where the eleven Malaysian patriotic youth were detained by the reactionary authorities, seven hundred demonstrators bravely fought against the "riot control squad" armed with American-made automatic rifles, helmets, and shields. The reactionary military police madly fired a large number of tear gas canisters, but the demonstrators, undaunted by the violence, continued their brave struggle. The crowd grew larger, and they repeatedly threw stones and glass bottles at the reactionary military police.

Reports indicate that on the 15th, Penang and other areas in northern Malaysia also held large-scale demonstrations and marches.

Reports also state that about thirty family members of the eleven Malaysian patriotic youth held a hunger strike outside the Kuala Lumpur Pudu Prison on the morning of the 15th to protest against the Rahman puppet regime's evil plot to murder their relatives.

The report says that in the early hours of the 15th, the Rahman puppet regime also searched the headquarters of the Malaysian Labor Party in Kuala Lumpur and arrested the party's leaders under the pretext of the so-called "Internal Security Act."

The eleven Malaysian patriotic youth, whom the Rahman regime plotted to murder, were arrested during the struggle against the neo-colonialist tool of American and British imperialism, "Malaysia," in 1964. Despite strong opposition from the Malaysian people, the Rahman regime savagely sentenced the eleven youth to "hanging" on charges of "treason" and planned to execute them on the morning of the 16th. Under the impact of the strong protest demonstrations by the Malaysian people, the Rahman puppet regime was forced to announce a "temporary stay of execution."

    新华社二十日讯　新加坡消息：情绪激昂的马来亚人民群众，十五日晚上在马来亚首府吉隆坡和槟榔屿等地方举行示威游行，愤怒地抗议拉赫曼傀儡集团蓄谋杀害十一位马来亚爱国青年的法西斯行径。
    据新加坡报纸报道，十五日晚上，吉隆坡市中心区和全市的其他许多地区，都爆发了群众性的抗议示威游行。示威群众高举标语牌，沿途高呼口号和向群众散发传单，强烈谴责拉赫曼傀儡集团蓄谋杀害马来亚青年的滔天罪行。
    在反动当局关禁十一位马来亚爱国青年的吉隆坡半山巴监狱外面，七百名示威群众同配备着美制自动步枪和钢盔、藤牌的“镇暴队”进行了英勇的搏斗。反动军警疯狂地发射大量的催泪弹，示威群众不畏强暴，继续进行英勇的斗争，群众越聚越多，他们不断用石块和玻璃瓶回击反动军警。
    据报道，马来亚北部的槟榔屿和其他地区，十五日也举行了群众性的示威游行。
    据报道，十一位马来亚爱国青年的家属约三十人，十五日晨在吉隆坡半山巴监狱外进行绝食斗争，抗议拉赫曼傀儡集团蓄谋杀害他们的亲人的罪恶行径。
    报道说，十五日凌晨，拉赫曼傀儡集团还搜查了吉隆坡马来亚劳工党总部，并引用所谓“内部治安法令”逮捕了劳工党负责人。
    拉赫曼傀儡集团蓄谋杀害的十一位马来亚爱国青年，是在一九六四年马来亚和印度尼西亚人民反对美英帝国主义的新殖民主义工具“马来西亚”的斗争中被捕的。拉赫曼集团不顾马来亚人民的强烈反对，野蛮地以所谓“叛国罪”将十一位青年“判处”绞刑，并定于八月十六日晨执行。在马来亚人民强大的抗议示威行动的冲击下，拉赫曼傀儡集团被迫宣布“暂缓执行”。
