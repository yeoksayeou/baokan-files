Early in the morning, Deputy Director Chen Xingji of the Revolutionary Committee of Rongcheng County, Shandong Province, set out to the Baoyu Commune to gather information. The journey to Baoyu is only about ten miles, but he walked for quite a while. The commune sent a message saying he had not yet arrived.

This was strange. Where had he gone?

It turned out that this young representative of the revolutionary masses did not follow the old routine of going to the commune office to listen to reports to understand the situation. He followed Chairman Mao's instruction, "All practical workers must go down to conduct investigations," and went straight to the front lines of class struggle and production struggle!

He saw that along the road, in the fields, people and horses were joyfully working, red flags were flying, and the commune members were laboring. He put down his luggage, rolled up his pants, and started working while asking the commune members questions. He asked them: How is the big criticism going during the busy farming season? The commune members told him, "We have studied Chairman Mao's works and understand the importance of big criticism. Class enemies are like the green onions under the eaves—even if the leaves are withered and the roots are dry, their hearts do not die. The busier the production, the more we must keep this string tight in our minds; the big criticism is going on vigorously." He listened and nodded happily. Then, he asked in detail about how the study classes were conducted and the progress of summer harvesting and planting. He also humbly listened to the opinions of the poor and lower-middle peasants about the county and commune-level revolutionary committees. During rest times, he studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions with the commune members and conducted field criticism together. The commune members looked at this stranger with surprise and joy: humble and kind, no different from the poor and lower-middle peasants in his words and actions. But no one knew that he was the deputy director of the county revolutionary committee.

It was not until the sun set that Chen Xingji, with a body full of sweat and dust, and a mind full of firsthand materials from the front lines, arrived at the commune. He first reported the situation he had obtained from the "frontline battlefield" to the commune and brought the valuable opinions of the poor and lower-middle peasants to the revolutionary committee. He proposed measures to improve the work. The members of the commune revolutionary committee were deeply moved and unanimously expressed their willingness to learn from the county revolutionary committee's leaders, go to the front lines to discover and solve problems.

Later, when the commune members found out that the person who was "no different from the poor and lower-middle peasants" was the deputy director of the county revolutionary committee, they all said with emotion: "The revolutionary committee praised by Chairman Mao is indeed good. The members of the revolutionary committee are all like Jiao Yulu, with no official airs, always among the people, connecting with the people, truly the good leaders of us poor and lower-middle peasants."

    副主任到哪儿去了？
    大清早，山东省荣成县革命委员会副主任陈兴吉，出发到泊于公社去了解情况。到泊于只有十里来路，可是他，走了好半天；公社来电话说，人还没有到。
    这就奇怪了，他到哪儿去了呢？
    原来，这位年轻的革命群众的代表，并没有按照老一套的做法，到公社的办公室里靠听汇报了解情况。他遵照毛主席“一切实际工作者必须向下作调查”的教导，首先到阶级斗争、生产斗争的第一线上去啦！他看到路旁田野里到处人欢马跃，红旗招展，社员们正在劳动，便放下行李，挽起裤腿，边干边向社员问这问那。他问社员：农忙时节大批判抓得怎么样？社员们告诉他：“俺们学习了毛主席著作，懂得了大批判的重要。阶级敌人是屋檐下的葱——叶焦根枯心不死。生产越忙，咱头脑中这根弦越松不得；大批判搞得轰轰烈烈。”他听了高兴得直点头。接着，他又详细问了学习班办得怎么样了，夏收夏种的进度如何？并虚心听取贫下中农对县、社两级革命委员会的意见。休息时，他和社员一同学习毛主席的最新指示，一同搞地头大批判。社员们用惊喜的目光，打量着这位陌生人：朴朴实实，和蔼可亲；一言一行，看不出和贫下中农有什么两样。可是，谁都不知道，他就是县革委会副主任。
    直到太阳落山的时候，陈兴吉才带着一身汗水和一身风尘，心里装着来自第一线上的第一手材料，来到公社里。他首先向公社反映了在“前沿阵地”上得到的情况，并且带来了贫下中农对革委会的宝贵意见，提出了改进工作的措施。公社革委会的同志听了，很受感动。一致表示向县革委会的领导同志学习，到第一线上去发现问题，解决问题。
    以后，当社员们知道了那位“和贫下中农没有什么两样”的人，就是县革委会副主任时，都感动地说：“毛主席他老人家称赞的革命委员会就是好，革委会的同志个个都象焦裕禄，半点官架子都没有，处处深入群众，联系群众，真是咱贫下中农的好带头人。”
