Shanghai's steel industry proletarian revolutionary faction and the broad revolutionary workers have resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production." They have achieved outstanding production results during the hot season.

Since July, which is the peak of the hot season, Shanghai's steel workers, tempered by the two-year-long Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, are unafraid of the heat and unafraid of hard work. With hearts burning with loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, they have declared: "No matter how high the temperature, it cannot surpass the sky-high enthusiasm of Shanghai's steel workers; no matter how red the furnace, it cannot surpass the red hearts of Shanghai's steel workers who are loyal to Chairman Mao." They have been fighting day and night in front of the roaring furnaces and beside the rumbling rolling mills, creating one outstanding achievement after another. The city's steel production in July increased by 5.4% compared to June, surpassing the level of the same period in 1966. In the first ten days of August, production increased by about 20% compared to the same period in July, a production level never before achieved during the hot season. Additionally, they have successfully developed low-alloy high-strength structural steel for buildings, low-alloy high-strength steel wire rope, low-alloy high-strength steel for fertilizer containers, and many other new types of steel and steel products. The quality of the products is stable, making new contributions to support China's socialist revolution and socialist construction.

An important reason for the continuous increase in production on Shanghai's steel industry front is that, under the leadership of revolutionary committees at various levels, the broad revolutionary workers have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, and earnestly implemented Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. They have focused on class struggle, striking accurately and decisively at a handful of class enemies, thereby raising the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad revolutionary workers. This has powerfully promoted the development of production.

    上海钢铁工业在高温季节创优异生产成绩
    上海钢铁工业战线无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工，坚决贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，在高温季节创造了优异的生产成绩。
    七月份以来正值高温季节，经过两年来无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的上海钢铁工人，不怕热，不怕累，怀着无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的红心，发出了豪言壮语：“高温再高，没有我们钢铁工人的冲天干劲高；炉火再红，没有我们钢铁工人无限忠于毛主席的红心红。”他们日夜奋战在烈火熊熊的炼钢炉前和机声隆隆的轧钢机旁，创造了一个又一个优异成绩：全市的钢产量，七月份比六月份增长百分之五点四，超过了一九六六年同期水平；八月上旬又比七月上旬增长百分之二十左右，这是历年高温季节从来没有过的生产水平。此外还试制成功了低合金高强度建筑结构钢、低合金高强度钢丝绳钢、低合金高强度化肥容器钢等许多新钢种和新钢材，产品质量稳定，为支援我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设做出了新的贡献。
    上海市钢铁工业战线生产不断上升的一个重要原因是，广大革命职工在各级革命委员会的领导下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，认真落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，狠抓阶级斗争，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人，从而提高了广大革命职工的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，有力地推动了生产的发展。
