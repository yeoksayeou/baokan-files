The Japan Communist Party (Left Faction) National Conference issued a statement on August 26 condemning the Soviet revisionist clique's armed invasion of Czechoslovakia. The statement is titled "The Bankruptcy of Soviet Modern Revisionism."

A detailed summary of this statement was published in the August 28 issue of "Long Weekly News."

The statement says: The armed invasion of Czechoslovakia by the Soviet modern revisionist clique and its followers is the most shameless act of imperialist fascist banditry.

The statement points out: The Soviet revisionist clique and the Czechoslovak revisionist clique are both enemies of the Czechoslovak people, enemies of the world's people, and enemies of socialism. They are accomplices of U.S. imperialism, the greatest traitors to the Czechoslovak people, the world's people, and socialism.

The statement says: Facing the crisis of the Czechoslovak Dubček revisionist clique attempting to break free from Soviet control, the Soviet revisionist clique, in the early hours of August 21, suddenly launched a surprise attack, invading the entire Czechoslovakia, attempting to place the Czechoslovak people directly under military suppression. Thus, the Soviet revisionist clique has exposed its fascist nature to the world.

The statement says, when the Soviet modern revisionist clique carried out this sudden armed invasion, it had informed its ally, U.S. imperialism, and received tacit approval. This has exposed the Soviet revisionist clique's true face as imperialist bandits aiming to dominate the world with the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The statement points out: The series of facts about the Soviet revisionist clique—Brezhnev, Kosygin, and other revisionists—launching an armed invasion of Czechoslovakia completely exposes the Soviet revisionist clique's betrayal of socialism under the banner of "socialism," betrayal of Marxism-Leninism under the banner of "Marxism-Leninism," collusion with U.S. imperialism, and the policy of the two superpowers dominating the world. The facts prove that the Soviet revisionist clique is the enemy of all the people of the world, including the Soviet people, and is a thoroughgoing anti-communist, counter-revolutionary, and anti-people traitor clique. The statement says: A series of facts show that the line of Soviet modern revisionism has completely bankrupted; the contradictions within the modern revisionist clique are intensifying, and it has fallen into a state of disintegration and fragmentation.

The statement says: The Soviet revisionist clique describes its bandit-like armed invasion of Czechoslovakia as "defending the achievements of socialism," "for the unity of fraternal countries," and "for the socialist family," etc. How shameless and ridiculous! The statement points out: Submitting to U.S. imperialism, betraying Marxism-Leninism, usurping the power of the dictatorship of the proletariat, turning it into a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, and internally destroying the great achievements of the first socialist state in human history, restoring capitalism, and peddling revisionism to the world—this is not done by anyone else, but by Khrushchev, and his faithful accomplice Brezhnev, Kosygin, and the like. The statement continues, they are diligently turning the communist parties and workers' parties of Eastern European countries into revisionist parties, destroying the great achievements of socialism, restoring capitalism, and are the chief culprits who betray the people of these countries and the world's revolutionary people. They talk about "defending the achievements of socialism," which is the same logic as U.S. imperialism's talk of "defending freedom and human dignity."

The statement says: The Soviet revisionist clique betrayed the Czechoslovak people, pushing revisionism onto Czechoslovakia, resulting in the emergence of the Novotný revisionist clique and the Dubček revisionist clique in Czechoslovakia. They both abolished the dictatorship of the proletariat in Czechoslovakia, restored capitalism, plundered the socialist achievements from the Czechoslovak people, and brought suffering to the people.

The statement points out: The relationship between the Soviet revisionist clique and U.S. imperialism is one of mutual collusion and mutual struggle. Now, the Soviet revisionists are engaged in a struggle with U.S. imperialism over Czechoslovakia.

The statement says: The Japan Communist Party Miyamoto revisionist clique shouts about carrying out "joint actions" with the Soviet revisionists, claiming it is the most important issue of the contemporary world. It submits to the Soviet revisionists, degenerating into an anti-communist, counter-revolutionary, anti-people, and anti-China traitor. The Japan Communist Party Miyamoto revisionist clique is at a loss over this incident and issued a statement full of sophistry. When discussing the issue of the Soviet revisionists' armed invasion, the statement does not contain a single word about the "Soviet Union." The Miyamoto revisionist clique, which has always claimed to be "independent and autonomous," has now thrown away even this signboard, exposing itself as a traitor to the Japanese people and the people of the world, and as a spy for the Soviet revisionists.

The statement points out: The Czechoslovak people will certainly defeat the Soviet invaders and overthrow the domestic revisionist elements, and will certainly advance along the path of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The statement says: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Comrade Mao Zedong has creatively solved and pointed out the path from socialism to communism. The great victory and development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China have uprooted the source of revisionism in China, advanced the socialist revolution, built China into a stronghold of the world revolution, and thus illuminated the path of the liberation struggle of the people of the world.

The statement says: The Soviet revisionist clique's armed invasion of Czechoslovakia fully exposes the contradictions within the modern revisionist clique, exposes their isolation and disintegration. This shows: In the great struggle between the revolutionary and counter-revolutionary forces, with socialist China, the people of Albania, and the international proletariat and revolutionary people of the whole world on one side, and U.S. imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of various countries on the other side, the revolutionary forces have won a victory; it shows that in the struggle between Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and modern revisionism, Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought has won a victory.

We are deeply convinced that the people of the world, under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, will certainly smash modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionists.

    日共（左派）全国协议会就苏修武装侵占捷克斯洛伐克发表声明
    苏修叛徒集团是全世界人民的敌人
    在马列主义、毛泽东思想指引下，世界人民必将粉碎以苏修为中心的现代修正主义
    新华社三十日讯东京消息：日本共产党（左派）全国协议会二十六日就苏修叛徒集团武装侵略捷克斯洛伐克发表声明。声明的题目是《苏联现代修正主义的破产》。
    这项声明的详细摘要刊登在二十八日出版的《长周新闻》上。
    声明说：苏联现代修正主义集团及其追随者对捷克斯洛伐克人民进行的武装侵略，是帝国主义法西斯强盗的最无耻的侵略行为。
    声明指出：苏修集团和捷修集团都是捷克斯洛伐克人民的敌人，是世界人民的敌人，是社会主义的敌人。它们是美帝国主义的帮凶，是捷克斯洛伐克人民和世界人民以及社会主义的最大的叛徒。
    声明说：面临捷克斯洛伐克杜布切克修正主义集团要摆脱苏修的控制的危机，苏修集团于八月二十日深夜，不顾一切地以突然袭击的方式，出兵侵占了整个捷克斯洛伐克，企图把捷克斯洛伐克人民直接置于军事压制之下。这样，苏修集团就在全世界人民面前暴露了它的法西斯的本来面目。
    声明说，苏联现代修正主义集团在进行这一突然袭击的武装侵略时，事先通知了它的盟友美帝国主义，并得到美帝国主义的默契。这就在全世界人民面前暴露了苏修集团企图以苏美两大国主宰世界的帝国主义强盗的真面目。
    声明指出：苏修集团——勃列日?夫、柯西金等修正主义者发动对捷克斯洛伐克的武装侵略的一系列事实，完全暴露了苏修集团打着“社会主义”的幌子，背叛社会主义，打着“马克思列宁主义”的幌子，背叛马克思列宁主义，勾结美帝国主义，推行苏美两大国主宰世界的政策。事实证明，苏修集团是全世界人民——包括苏联人民在内——的敌人，是彻头彻尾的反共、反革命、反人民的叛徒集团。声明说：一系列事实表明，苏联现代修正主义的路线已经彻底破产；现代修正主义集团的内部矛盾日益激化，已经陷于分崩离析、四分五裂的状态。
    声明说：苏修集团把它对捷克斯洛伐克实行的强盗式的武装侵略，说成是什么“维护社会主义的成果”、“是为了兄弟国家的团结”和“为了社会主义大家庭”等等。这是何等地无耻和滑稽！声明指出：屈服于美帝国主义，背叛马克思列宁主义，篡夺无产阶级专政的政权，把它变为资产阶级专政，并且从内部破坏了人类历史上第一个社会主义国家的伟大成果，复辟了资本主义并向全世界兜售修正主义，这不是别人，正是赫鲁晓夫，正是他的忠实伙伴勃列日?夫、柯西金之流。声明接着说，他们卖力地把东欧国家的共产党和工人党变成修正主义的党，并且破坏伟大的社会主义成果，复辟资本主义，他们是背叛这些国家的人民和世界革命人民的罪魁祸首。他们说什么要“维护社会主义的成果”，这与美帝国主义所说的“维护自由和人的尊严”一样是强盗的逻辑。
    声明说：苏修集团背叛捷克斯洛伐克人民，向捷克斯洛伐克推销修正主义的结果，在捷克斯洛伐克出现了诺沃提尼修正主义集团，出现了杜布切克修正主义集团。它们都取消捷克斯洛伐克的无产阶级专政，复辟资本主义，从捷克斯洛伐克人民手中掠夺社会主义成果，给人民带来了苦难。
    声明指出：苏修集团和美帝国主义的关系，是既互相勾结、又互相争夺。现在，苏修正在同美帝国主义展开对捷克斯洛伐克的争夺战。
    声明说：日共宫本修正主义集团叫嚷同苏修实行“联合行动”，是什么当代世界上最重大的课题。它屈服于苏修，堕落成为反共、反革命、反人民、反华的叛徒。日共宫本修正主义集团对于这一次事件，慌了手脚，发表了一项充满了诡辩的声明。在谈到苏修的武装侵略的问题时，声明中却找不到一个“苏联”的字样。一向打着“独立自主”招牌的宫本修正主义集团，现在连这块招牌也抛到九霄云外去了，从而暴露了它是日本人民和世界人民的叛徒，是不折不扣的苏修的奸细的嘴脸。
    声明指出：捷克斯洛伐克人民必将打败苏修侵略者和打倒国内的修正主义分子，必将走上无产阶级专政的道路。
    声明说：毛泽东同志亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，创造性地解决和指出了从社会主义走向共产主义的道路。伟大的中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利发展，挖掉了在中国产生修正主义的根子，推进了社会主义革命，把中国建设成为世界革命的坚强堡垒，从而照亮了世界人民的解放斗争的道路。
    声明说：苏修集团武装侵略捷克斯洛伐克的事件，充分地暴露了现代修正主义集团内部的矛盾，暴露了它们陷于孤立和已经分崩离析。这表明：在以社会主义中国、阿尔巴尼亚人民以及整个国际无产阶级和全世界革命人民为一方，以美帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派为另一方的革命和反革命的两大势力的大搏斗中，革命势力取得了胜利；表明在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想同现代修正主义的斗争中，马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想取得了胜利。
    我们深信，在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想指引下的全世界人民，必将粉碎以苏修为中心的现代修正主义。
