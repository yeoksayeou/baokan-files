	Somali Friends Warmly Praise the Chinese People's Liberation Army
	The Chinese People's Liberation Army, founded and led by Chairman Mao, has become a powerful backbone for oppressed peoples worldwide

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Mogadishu, the Somali Writers Association and others recently warmly praised the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The Somali Writers Association specially wrote an article for the 41st anniversary of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, extending "the warmest and most sincere congratulations to the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the greatest army in the world," and paying "the highest respect to Mao Zedong, the founder of this great army."

	The article pointed out that this proletarian army, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, "is passing down the great ideological weapon of Mao Zedong Thought from generation to generation to oppose imperialism and modern revisionism." This army is armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, making it a powerful force. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, it possesses a high level of political awareness and proletarian internationalism, equipped with the most modern weapons and technology. At any time, it supports the liberation struggles of oppressed peoples worldwide. The stance of the Chinese people in supporting the struggles of the Vietnamese people, the Palestinian people, the Angolan people, and other peoples proves that the Chinese People's Liberation Army is the pillar of the international proletariat and all liberation movements.

	The article concludes with the slogan: "Long live the greatest commander of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Chairman Mao Zedong!"

	Some Somali youth friends who often study Chairman Mao's works wrote in an article that the Chinese People's Liberation Army, founded, cultivated, and led by the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, Chairman Mao Zedong, has maintained and greatly carried forward its glorious traditions. It has a high level of proletarian consciousness and fighting spirit, is loyal to the people and Chairman Mao, and has made outstanding contributions to the continuous advancement of the great proletarian cultural revolution and the great cause of socialist revolution.

	The article states that in the struggle against imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism centered around the Soviet leadership, the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, with their great Marxist-Leninist ideology and proletarian internationalism, have become a powerful backbone for all revolutionary and oppressed peoples worldwide.

	The article also states that the Chinese People's Liberation Army has achieved brilliant achievements in the rapid development of science and technology.

	The article concludes with the slogans: "Long live Chairman Mao's people's war line!" "Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!"

　　索马里朋友热烈赞扬中国人民解放军
　　毛主席缔造和领导的中国人民解放军已成为全世界被压迫人民的强大后盾
    据新华社摩加迪沙电　索马里作家协会等最近热烈赞扬中国人民解放军。索马里作家协会专门为中国人民解放军建军四十一周年写了一篇文章，向“中国人民解放军这支世界上最伟大的军队表示最热烈最衷心的祝贺，并向这支伟大军队的缔造者毛泽东主席致以崇高的敬意”。
    文章指出，这支在毛主席领导下的无产阶级的军队“正在把毛泽东思想作为反对帝国主义和反对现代修正主义的强大思想武器世世代代传下去”。这支军队是用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的一支强大的军队。它在毛泽东思想的指导下具有高度的政治觉悟和无产阶级国际主义精神，拥有最现代化的武器和技术装备。它在任何时候都支持世界被压迫人民的解放事业。中国人民支持越南人民、巴勒斯坦人民、安哥拉人民和其他地区人民的斗争的立场证明，中国人民解放军是国际无产阶级和一切解放运动的支柱。
    文章最后高呼：“中国人民解放军的最伟大的统帅毛泽东主席万岁！”
    一些经常学习毛主席著作的索马里青年朋友在一篇文章中说，由当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东主席所缔造、培育和领导的中国人民解放军，保持并大大地发扬了自己的光荣传统。它有高度的无产阶级觉悟和斗争精神，忠于人民和毛泽东主席，对胜利进行中国无产阶级文化大革命和推动伟大的社会主义革命事业不断前进，作出了杰出的贡献。
    文章说，在反对以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏联领导集团为中心的现代修正主义的斗争中，中国人民和中国人民解放军由于具有伟大的马克思列宁主义思想和无产阶级国际主义精神，已经成为全世界一切革命人民和被压迫人民的强大后盾。
    文章还说，中国人民解放军在迅速发展科学和技术方面也取得了光辉的成就。
    文章最后高呼：“毛主席的人民战争路线万岁！”“毛泽东主席万岁！”
