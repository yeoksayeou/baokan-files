More than a thousand young intellectuals from various ethnic groups in Qianshan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, Guizhou, have settled in rural areas.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Guizhou, August 20th: The Red Guards and revolutionary young intellectuals from various ethnic groups in Qianshan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, Guizhou, have followed the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings on "true revolutionaries must be willing and able to integrate with the workers and peasants." They have resolutely taken the path of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers. In recent months, more than 1,100 junior and senior high school graduates and Red Guards from seven counties, including Libo, Luodian, and Changshun, have settled in rural areas. They are determined to learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants, to forge themselves into laborers with socialist consciousness and culture, and to contribute to the construction of socialist new rural areas.

Most of these Red Guards and revolutionary young intellectuals who have settled in rural areas or applied to go to rural areas are proletarian revolutionaries who emerged during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Some are members of the county revolutionary committees, leaders of the county Red Guard Congress, or school revolutionary committees. Many are active promoters of studying and applying Chairman Mao's thoughts. They follow Chairman Mao's teachings and resolutely take the path of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers, vowing to carry out the educational revolution to the end.

Before going to the countryside, these high school graduates who have settled in rural areas or applied to go to rural areas studied Chairman Mao's teachings on educational revolution and severely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of China's Khrushchev. Great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "How do we judge whether a young person is a revolutionary? What standard do we use? What do we use to distinguish him? There is only one standard, that is, whether he is willing and able to integrate with the broad masses of workers and peasants." However, China's Khrushchev and his agents strongly opposed Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line and tried every means to cultivate intellectual youth into spiritual aristocrats who are detached from proletarian politics, labor, and reality, becoming tools for the restoration of capitalism. Under the leadership of the school revolutionary committees, the Red Guards and revolutionary young intellectuals in Qianshan Autonomous Prefecture used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to severely criticize China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies such as "intellectual education first," "admission to college first," and "suffering a small loss for a big gain." They firmly established the thought of serving the people wholeheartedly. Many schools invited students' parents to participate in the revolutionary criticism during the revolutionary criticism, making school, family, and social education closely integrated. Through the revolutionary criticism, Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line has been deeply rooted in people's hearts.

After going to the countryside, these young intellectuals, together with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasped the direction of the struggle, deeply carried out revolutionary criticism, severely criticized China's Khrushchev's "three freedoms and one contract," "four freedoms," and "theory of the extinction of class struggle," and strongly promoted the local revolution and production. Some young intellectuals and poor and lower-middle peasants studied and applied Chairman Mao Zedong Thought together, analyzed the new situation, new characteristics, and new problems of class struggle, and exposed hidden class enemies.

    向贫下中农学习　做革命事业接班人
    贵州黔南布依族苗族自治州一千多名知识青年到农村安家落户
    据新华社贵阳二十日电　贵州黔南布依族苗族自治州的红卫兵小将和各族革命知识青年，遵照伟大领袖毛主席关于“真正的革命者必定是愿意并且实行和工农民众相结合的”教导，坚决走同工农兵相结合的道路。近几个月来，这个自治州的荔波、罗甸、长顺等七个县，已有一千一百多名今年毕业的初中和高中学生、红卫兵小将到农村安家落户。他们决心拜贫下中农为师，把自己锻炼成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者，为建设社会主义新农村贡献力量。
    这批在农村安家落户的红卫兵和革命知识青年，大部分是在无产阶级文化大革命中冲杀出来的无产阶级革命派，有些是县革委会的委员、县红代会或学校革委会的负责成员，有很多人是活学活用毛泽东思想的积极分子，他们遵照毛主席的教导，坚决走同工农兵相结合的道路，誓把教育革命进行到底。
    这些已经到农村安家落户或申请去农村的中学毕业生，在去农村之前，认真学习了毛主席关于教育革命的论述，狠狠批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义教育路线。伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“看一个青年是不是革命的，拿什么做标准呢？拿什么去辨别他呢？只有一个标准，这就是看他愿意不愿意、并且实行不实行和广大的工农群众结合在一块。”而中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人，却竭力反对毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，千方百计地妄图把知识青年培养成脱离无产阶级政治、脱离劳动和脱离实际的精神贵族，成为复辟资本主义的工具。黔南自治州的红卫兵小将和革命知识青年在各学校革委会的领导下，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的“智育第一”、“升学第一”、“吃小亏占大便宜”等反革命修正主义谬论，大立全心全意为人民服务的思想。许多学校在革命大批判中，还邀请学生家长参加，使学校、家庭和社会教育紧密结合起来。通过革命大批判，毛主席的无产阶级教育路线更加深入人心。
    这些知识青年到农村以后，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，同广大贫下中农一道，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，深入开展革命大批判，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的“三自一包”、“四大自由”、“阶级斗争熄灭”论，有力地推动了当地的革命和生产。有的知识青年和贫下中农一道活学活用毛泽东思想，分析阶级斗争的新形势、新特点、新问题，挖出了暗藏的阶级敌人。
