	The people of all countries, who make up more than ninety percent of the world's population, are always revolutionary. They will always support Marxism-Leninism. They will not support revisionism. Some people may temporarily support it, but in the end, they will abandon it. They will gradually awaken, always oppose imperialism and the reactionaries of all countries, and always oppose revisionism.

    毛主席语录
    各国的人民，占人口总数的百分之九十以上的人民大众，总是要革命的，总是会拥护马克思列宁主义的。他们不会拥护修正主义，有些人暂时拥护，将来终究会抛弃它。他们总会逐步地觉醒起来，总会反对帝国主义和各国的反动派，总会反对修正主义。
