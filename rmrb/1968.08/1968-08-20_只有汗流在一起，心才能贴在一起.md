Only when we sweat together, our hearts will be united.

Before the implementation of streamlining and reducing bureaucracy, one day, Deputy Director Pan Jialong of the Revolutionary Committee of the Flat Glass Factory in Weihai, Shandong Province, came to the coal gas furnace section in high spirits. As soon as he entered, he noticed that the temperature was unstable and the coal consumption was high. He couldn't help but loudly ask the workers who were working, "What's going on! The temperature is so unstable, and the coal consumption is so high?" The workers, seeing him, intended to explain the situation to him. However, seeing his attitude, they got angry and replied, "You leaders don't know, how can we know!" This sentence left Pan Jialong speechless, and he didn't say anything more, but his heart was very uncomfortable.

After Chairman Mao's latest directive on "Revolutionary Committees should implement unified leadership, break down overlapping administrative structures, streamline and reduce bureaucracy, and organize a revolutionary leadership team that is connected with the masses" was issued, Pan was so excited that he couldn't sleep for several nights. Under the lamplight, he held Chairman Mao's latest directive in his hand, reading and thinking: Chairman Mao's words are so good, but how have I been doing? When I go to the workshop, I don't humbly learn from the masses and work with the workers, but instead act as a leader, gesturing in front of the workers. If the members of the Revolutionary Committee are like me, how can we organize a revolutionary leadership team that is connected with the masses? Pan thought more and more, feeling more and more sad, and decided to change his style and honestly become a student of the masses.

The factory Revolutionary Committee quickly implemented streamlining and reducing bureaucracy. Pan put on his work clothes and went to the coal gas furnace section every day, picking up tools and working with the workers. Wherever it was hard, he went there, and wherever there were difficulties, he fought there. In May, the factory lacked high-quality coal, and everyone was very worried. What to do? Pan then thought of Chairman Mao's teaching: "The masses are the real heroes." He immediately convened a meeting of all workers in the coal gas furnace section. At the meeting, he led the workers to study Chairman Mao's teachings over and over again: "Our comrades should see achievements and see light in times of difficulty, and raise our spirits." Chairman Mao's words greatly strengthened the workers' determination to overcome difficulties. They said, "We, the working class, are made of steel, unafraid of any difficulties. In the past, we burned high-quality coal, but today we must make it burn low-quality coal!" Seeing that the workers no longer had the same attitude towards the problems he raised, Pan was even more moved.

Under Pan's leadership, the workers, with unwavering confidence, began to attack the difficulties. Pan, day and night, guarded by the furnace, carefully observed the fire, humbly asked the workers for advice, and studied with the workers. They adopted the method of frequently removing furnace ash to overcome the difficulty of burning low-quality coal. In the past, they only removed furnace ash twice a day, but now they removed it four times a day. Each shift communicated with each other, maintaining close contact, so that every worker could grasp and control the entire coal gas furnace. After a few days of hard work, they finally succeeded in the experiment, breaking the old framework that the glass factory could not burn low-quality coal, and the coal consumption rate was also reduced by 16.5% compared to April, exceeding the production plan for May.

This incident gave Pan Jialong a great lesson. He said with deep feelings: "Only when we sweat together with the masses, can our hearts be united."

    只有汗流在一起，心才能贴在一起
    山东省威海市平板玻璃厂在实行精兵简政前，有一天，革委会副主任潘家龙兴致勃勃地来到煤气炉工段。他一进门，看见温度很不稳定，煤的消耗率也很大，就忍不住朝着正在劳动的工人大声问了一句：“怎么搞的！温度这样不稳定，煤的消耗率这么大？”工人见他来，本想把具体情况告诉他，可是一见他这副派头，便生气地回了一句：“你们当领导的不知道，咱怎么能知道！”一句话把潘家龙的嘴堵住了，他再也没说什么，心里可好大的不舒服。
  毛主席关于“革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子”的最新指示下来后，小潘激动得几夜没睡好觉。灯光下，他手里拿着毛主席这一最新指示，边读边想：毛主席他老人家说得多好啊，可我是怎样做的呢？下到车间不是虚心地向群众学习，和工人一块儿干活，而是以领导者自居，在工人面前指手划脚，如果革委会成员都象我这样，怎么能组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子呢？小潘越想越难过，决心改变作风，老老实实当群众的小学生。
    厂革委会很快地实行了精兵简政。小潘穿起了工作服，天天到煤气炉工段，拿起工具和工人一块劳动。那里艰苦，他就到那里去，那里有困难，他就到那里战斗。五月份，厂里缺少优质煤，大家心里都很着急。怎么办？小潘这时想到毛主席关于“群众是真正的英雄”的教导，他马上召开了煤气炉工段全体工人大会。会上他带领工人一遍又一遍地学习毛主席的教导：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”毛主席的话极大地增强了工人们克服困难的决心。他们说：“我们工人阶级就是硬骨头，不怕任何困难，过去烧优质煤，今天我们非让它烧低质煤不可！”小潘见工人对他提出的问题，再也不象从前那种态度了，心里更是激动。
    在小潘的带领下，工人们怀着必胜的信心，开始向困难进攻了。小潘不分白天黑夜地守在炉旁，仔细地观察炉火，虚心地向工人请教，和工人们一道研究。他们采取勤扒炉灰的办法克服烧低质煤的困难。过去一天只扒两次炉灰，现在他们每天扒四次炉灰。各班组之间也互通情报，紧密联系，使每个工人都能掌握和控制整个煤气炉的情况。经过几天的奋战，终于试验成功，打破了玻璃厂不能烧低质煤的旧框框，煤的消耗率也比四月份降低了百分之十六点五，超额完成了五月份生产计划。
    这件事使潘家龙受到了很大教育。他深有感触地说：“只有和群众汗流在一起，才能和他们心贴在一起。”
