Iraqi newspaper *Al-Thawra* has recently published a series of editorials advocating for the mobilization of all Arab peoples to engage in armed struggle against imperialism and Israeli aggression. The editorials also condemn the alleged peaceful resolution of the Palestinian issue as a plot.

In an editorial published on August 28, *Al-Thawra* strongly denounced Israel's recent acts of aggression against Arab countries. The editorial emphasized that in the face of Israeli aggression, the Arab masses have the responsibility to intensify armed struggle. It asserted that only through armed struggle can victory be achieved in the struggle against imperialism, colonialism, and reactionary forces in the entire region.

The editorial stressed, "The Palestinian issue is a concern for all Arab masses. It is necessary to strengthen the activities of the Palestinian guerrillas. The only path to victory is for all Arab masses to join the battle." The editorial pointed out, "For the Arab nation, the only way to liberate Palestine is through armed struggle."

In another editorial published on August 25, *Al-Thawra* severely criticized the alleged peaceful resolution of the Middle East issue as a trick to sacrifice the rights of the Arab people.

    据新华社巴格达二十八日电　伊拉克《革命报》近来连续发表社论，主张动员全体阿拉伯人民进行反对帝国主义和以色列侵略者的人民武装斗争，并谴责所谓和平解决巴勒斯坦问题的阴谋。《革命报》二十八日在社论中强烈谴责以色列最近对阿拉伯国家的侵略行动，并指出在以色列侵略者的暴行面前，阿拉伯群众有责任加强武装斗争，通过武装斗争，才能在整个地区取得反对帝国主义、殖民主义和反动势力斗争的胜利。
    社论强调说：“巴勒斯坦问题，是全体阿拉伯群众的问题。必须加强巴勒斯坦游击队的活动。让全体阿拉伯群众投入战斗，是取得战斗胜利的唯一途径。”社论强调指出：“对阿拉伯民族来说，收复巴勒斯坦的唯一办法，就是进行武装斗争。”
    《革命报》还在二十五日发表社论，严厉抨击所谓和平解决中东问题的花招是牺牲阿拉伯人民权利的骗局。
