Shengpu's industrial frontline is seeing a continuously improving revolutionary production situation. The city's industrial output value is steadily increasing, and the production of many key products has seen significant growth.

The workers' class in Shengpu City, under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implements the battle orders of the great leader Chairman Mao, firmly grasps the revolution, and vigorously promotes production. This has led to a situation where the revolutionary and production enthusiasm of the entire city is surging higher and higher, and the situation is getting better and better. Since this year, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the revolutionary unity of the city's industrial frontline has been further consolidated and developed, the pace of the revolutionary three-in-one combination has been significantly accelerated, and more than 95% of the units in the city have established revolutionary committees. The industrial output value has steadily increased, with the second quarter seeing a 21.4% increase over the first quarter. Especially since July, due to the focus on class struggle, industrial production has seen a new upsurge. The city's industrial output value in July increased by 12.1% compared to June. The production of many key products has seen significant growth. According to statistics from more than 40 key products, more than 70% have seen significant growth compared to June. Among them, diesel engines, air compressors, soap, matches, cigarettes, towels, yarn, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, dyed and printed fabrics, fertilizers, thermos bottles, and other products have seen even faster growth, with some already exceeding historical highs. Many factories, workshops, and teams have continuously created new records for daily and monthly production. A new high tide of technological innovation and technological revolution is emerging. In the process of grasping the revolution and promoting production, a number of advanced units have emerged, and some "difficult-to-manage" units are also rapidly changing their faces.

The workers' class in Shengpu City has played a leading role in class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiments. They always remember Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forget class struggle" and have launched a great exposure, criticism, and struggle against a handful of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist roaders, and counter-revolutionaries hidden within the factories. Through the focus on anti-enemy struggle, the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad revolutionary masses has reached an unprecedented height, and socialist labor enthusiasm has greatly increased, powerfully promoting the great development of production. After exposing a deeply hidden class enemy, the revolutionary workers of the Shengpu Flour Mill, with great hatred towards the class enemy, actively participated in production. The entire factory used only half the time it usually takes to complete the annual major overhaul ahead of schedule and consecutively created new records for processing wheat since the factory's establishment. In July, they also completed the state plan ahead of schedule and in excess.

The workers' class in Shengpu City has deeply and persistently carried out revolutionary criticism, fiercely criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of managing enterprises promoted by China's Khrushchev and his agents, and powerfully striking against the old systems and old regulations that shackle the development of productive forces, promoting the development of production. The Shengpu Wool Mill, a factory with only about 500 people, has 10 departments and more than 70 cadres, with hundreds of regulations. This set of revisionist management systems severely shackled the development of productive forces. Recently, the factory revolutionary committee implemented streamlining and simplification, transferring 60% of departmental cadres to the production frontline. At the same time, they broke through the old frameworks and old regulations that shackle productive forces, and the entire factory quickly saw a high tide of technological revolution and technological innovation. Many teams consecutively created new production records since the factory's establishment, with product quality exceeding national standards, and in July, they also completed the production plan ahead of schedule and in excess.

    工业总产值稳步增长，许多主要产品产量大幅度上升
    新华社合肥二十二日电　蚌埠市工人阶级高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决贯彻执行伟大领袖毛主席的战斗号令，狠抓革命，猛促生产，使全市革命和生产的热潮一浪高过一浪，形势越来越好。今年以来，蚌埠市工业战线在毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，革命大联合日益巩固和发展，革命三结合的步伐大大加快，全市工业战线百分之九十五以上的单位，成立了革命委员会。工业总产值稳步增长，第二季度比第一季度增长百分之二十一点四。特别是七月份以来，由于狠抓阶级斗争，工业生产出现了新的高潮，全市工业总产值比六月份增长百分之十二点一，很多主要产品的产量大幅度上升，据四十多种主要产品统计，有百分之七十以上比六月份大幅度增长，其中柴油机、空气压缩机、肥皂、火柴、卷烟、毛巾、毛线、棉纱、棉布、染印布、化肥、保温瓶等增长得更快，有的已超过了历史上的最高水平。不少工厂、车间、班组连续创造了日产和月产的最高纪录。技术革新和技术革命的新高潮正在出现。在抓革命，促生产中还涌现出一批先进单位，一些“老大难”单位也正在迅速改变面貌。
    蚌埠市工人阶级在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验中都发挥了领导作用。他们牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，对一小撮隐藏在工厂内部的叛徒、特务、死不改悔的走资派和反革命分子，展开了大揭发、大批判、大斗争。通过狠抓对敌斗争，广大革命职工阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟空前提高，社会主义劳动热情大大高涨，有力地推动了生产的大发展。蚌埠面粉厂的革命工人在揪出了隐藏很深的阶级敌人后，他们怀着对阶级敌人的无比仇恨，积极投入生产，全厂只用了以往一半的时间就提前完成了年度大检修任务，并接连创造了建厂以来加工小麦最新纪录，七月份又提前和超额完成了国家计划。
    蚌埠市工人阶级深入持久地开展了革命大批判，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人所推行的反革命修正主义办企业路线，猛烈地冲击了束缚生产力发展的旧体制、旧规章，促进了生产的发展。蚌埠毛纺厂这个仅有五百来人的工厂，就有十个科室和七十多个干部，几百条规章制度，这套修正主义的管理制度，严重地束缚了生产力的发展。最近，厂革委会实行了精兵简政，把百分之六十的科室干部，下放到生产第一线，同时大破束缚生产力的旧框框、旧条条，全厂很快出现了技术革命和技术革新的热潮，不少班组连续创造了建厂以来的生产最高纪录，产品质量超过国家标准，七月份还提前超额完成了生产计划。
