Workers and technicians armed with Mao Zedong Thought have limitless creativity. The Shanghai Dongfanghong Sewing Machine Factory has successfully developed a new type of medical sewing machine. Using it to suture surgical incisions significantly shortens the surgical time, saves manpower, and reduces the pain of patients and the workload of medical staff.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai - Some operating rooms in Shanghai hospitals are now using a very agile new type of medical sewing machine. Using it to suture surgical incisions significantly shortens the surgical time, saves manpower, and greatly reduces the pain of patients and the workload of medical staff.

This new type of sewing machine is a new thing that emerged during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It was created by workers and technicians armed with Mao Zedong Thought after two years of effort.

In 1961, the Shanghai Dongfanghong Sewing Machine Factory received a letter from a surgeon in Shanxi requesting the trial production of a sewing machine for suturing surgical incisions. At that time, a handful of capitalist roaders and bourgeois technical "authorities" who controlled the factory's production technology saw the letter and, with a servile attitude, said, "Such a thing, even foreigners can't figure it out, how can we do it!" They coldly replied to the letter and kicked the innovation suggestion out of the factory.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, led and initiated by Chairman Mao, greatly stimulated the workers' enthusiasm for technological revolution. A fitter, an assembler, and a worker technician from this factory, with the revolutionary spirit of daring to think, speak, do, and forge ahead, decided to trial-produce a medical sewing machine for suturing surgical incisions.

However, their revolutionary demands were opposed by a handful of capitalist roaders and bourgeois technical "authorities." They said, "Foreign countries don't even have this medical sewing machine, how can you few uneducated workers do it?!"

The workers firmly replied, "We must not follow behind the foreigners! We must have what foreigners have, and we must also have what foreigners don't have!"

The cultural level of the three of them was not high: one was semi-illiterate, one did not finish elementary school, and one had only a junior high school education. However, they firmly believed that with Mao Zedong Thought arming their minds and the support of the broad revolutionary masses, they would definitely succeed. They resolved to "make up their minds, not be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." The capitalist roaders did not provide a room, so they conducted experiments in a dilapidated house in the pigsty; the capitalist roaders did not provide tools, so they took the parts to the machine repair shop for processing; the capitalist roaders did not provide funds, so they squeezed out some money from the technical department's miscellaneous fees for experimental expenses. When they couldn't design the blueprints for the medical sewing machine, they followed Chairman Mao's teachings on "investigation and study" and went to various hospitals to visit and consult.

Just as they were overcoming difficulties and struggling hard, the proletarian revolutionary faction of the entire factory emerged from the white terror of the bourgeois reactionary line, seized back the power usurped by the capitalist roaders, and gave them great encouragement. They firmly declared: Chairman Mao is backing us up, and we must make Chairman Mao proud!

With the enthusiastic cooperation of revolutionary medical staff in the hospitals and the strong support of the proletarian revolutionary faction of the entire factory, they started from scratch, tackled the easy problems first, and gradually overcame various technical difficulties. They quickly developed a sewing machine for suturing the epidermis; then, they developed a sewing machine for suturing internal organs. After clinical trials and continuous improvements, this new type of medical sewing machine has now been finalized and started small-batch production.

    毛泽东思想武装起来的工人和工人技术员有无穷的创造力
    上海东方红缝纫机厂试制成新型医用缝纫器
    用它来缝合手术切口，大大缩短了手术时间，节省了人力，减轻了病人的痛苦和医务人员的劳动强度
    新华社上海电　上海一些医院的手术室里，正在试用一种很灵巧的新型医用缝纫器。用它来缝合手术切口，大大缩短了手术时间，节省了人力，还大大减轻了病人的痛苦和医务人员的劳动强度。
    这种新型缝纫器，是在无产阶级文化大革命中出现的新事物，是用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人和工人技术员经过两年努力创造出来的。
    一九六一年，上海东方红缝纫机厂收到山西一位外科医生的来信，要求试制缝合手术切口用的缝纫器。当时，掌握全厂生产技术大权的党内一小撮走资派和资产阶级技术“权威”看了来信，奴才相十足地说：“这种东西，外国人也搞不出名堂，我们哪能行！”他们很冷淡地回了一封信，就把这个革新建议踢出厂门。
    毛主席亲自领导和发动的无产阶级文化大革命，极大地焕发了工人开展技术革命的积极性。这个工厂的一个钳工、一个装配工和一个工人技术员，发扬敢想、敢说、敢干、敢闯的革命精神，决心试制缝合手术切口的医用缝纫器。
    但是，他们的革命要求，却受到了一小撮走资派和资产阶级技术“权威”的反对。他们说：“外国还没有这种医用缝纫器，凭你们几个没有文化的工人能搞得出来？！”
    工人斩钉截铁地回答说：“我们决不能跟在洋人后面爬行！外国有的我们要有，外国没有的我们也要有！”
    他们三个人的文化水平是不高：一个是半文盲，一个小学没毕业，一个只有初中水平。但是，他们坚信，有毛泽东思想武装头脑，有广大革命职工的支持，一定能成功。他们立志“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”走资派不给房子，他们就在养猪场一间破屋里进行试验；走资派不给工具，他们就把零件拿到机修间去加工；走资派不给资金，他们就从技术科杂费中挤出点钱作试验费。一时设计不出医用缝纫器的图纸，他们就遵照毛主席“调查研究”的教导，深入各医院去访问请教。
    正当他们克服困难，艰苦奋斗的时候，全厂无产阶级革命派从资产阶级反动路线的白色恐怖下“杀”出来，夺回了被走资派窃取的大权，给了他们极大的鼓舞。他们坚决表示：毛主席为我们撑腰，我们一定要为毛主席争气！
    他们在医院革命医务人员的热情配合下，在全厂无产阶级革命派的大力支持下，白手起家，先易后难，由浅入深，克服了技术上的种种困难，很快搞出了缝合表皮的缝纫器；随后，又搞出了缝合内脏的缝纫器。经过临床试用，不断改进，不断完善，这种新型医用缝纫器现在已经定型，并且开始了小批生产。
