Democratic centralism is our Party's organizational principle, the application of the mass line in Party life, and a reliable guarantee for implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The Chinese Khrushchev, using despicable methods of deception, fundamentally distorts and usurps the Party's democratic centralism. On the one hand, he opposes proletarian democracy, advocating the "tame tool" theory and preaching slave ideology; on the other hand, he opposes proletarian centralism, emphasizing spontaneous mass movements, spreading anarchism, and advocating rightist splittism. Both tactics serve one purpose: to oppose Chairman Mao, to oppose Mao Zedong Thought, to oppose Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and to promote a counter-revolutionary revisionist line. His ultimate goal is to transform our Party into a revisionist party, a fascist party, and to seize power and restore capitalism.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "To make the Party strong, we must rely on democratic centralism to mobilize the initiative of the entire Party." "Whether in the army or in the localities, Party democracy should serve to consolidate discipline and enhance combat effectiveness, not to weaken this discipline and combat effectiveness." Relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the democratic centralism consistently advocated by Chairman Mao, in our country's various revolutionary struggles, the initiative of the broad masses of Party members and the people has been greatly mobilized. We have defeated powerful domestic and foreign enemies and ensured that the revolution has achieved one great victory after another. The Chinese Khrushchev fully understands that democratic centralism is the fundamental system of the Party and the state, and is a major obstacle to his promotion of the revisionist line and the restoration of capitalism. Therefore, he has been scheming to fundamentally abolish the Party's centralized and unified leadership based on Mao Zedong Thought, to split our revolutionary ranks, to weaken our revolutionary discipline, and to undermine the revolutionary authority of the proletariat. We must use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to uphold and defend the Party's democratic centralism and ensure the Party's centralized and unified leadership based on Mao Zedong Thought.

Our company's Party branch, following Chairman Mao's teachings, has, in the midst of acute and complex class struggles, adhered to the Party's democratic centralism, continuously strengthened the construction of the Party branch, and advanced along Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We have been consecutively rated as a "Four Good" company for seven years. Once, our company was dispersed across eleven construction sites in three provinces and regions, from the grasslands of Inner Mongolia to the banks of the Yangtze River, performing mechanical construction tasks. In this situation, should we adhere to the Party's democratic centralism and strengthen collective leadership, or should we each act independently and "put ourselves at the center"? This is not just a matter of work methods; it is a question of whether we adhere to the Party's centralized and unified leadership and whether we, under the unified leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Recognizing the importance of this issue, we promptly convened a branch committee meeting and seriously studied Chairman Mao's statements on the Party's democratic centralism and Party discipline. Through the study, everyone realized: without the Party's centralized and unified leadership, the army would have no combat effectiveness, and we would not be able to consolidate and develop the victories of the revolution. Consciously, seriously, and strictly acting in accordance with the principles of democratic centralism is an important sign of loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and loyalty to the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao. It is a manifestation of the proletariat's firm Party spirit. After the branch committee unified its thinking, in the process of executing tasks, each branch committee member resolutely implemented the branch's resolutions, encountered problems, and resolutely acted according to Chairman Mao's teachings and the branch committee's opinions, without acting on their own or making independent decisions. Because we adhered to the Party's collective leadership and maintained the Party's centralized and unified leadership, we ensured that the entire company held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. Formally, the members of the branch committee and the cadres and soldiers of the entire company were dispersed to execute tasks, but ideologically, they maintained a high degree of centralized unity. Everyone did their best: they did not mind the hardships of remote mountains and deserts, they did not fear the cold of ice and snow, they did not fear the scorching heat of summer, and they did not complain about the heavy workload. Everyone had one mind: physically distant from Beijing by thousands of mountains and rivers, but mentally close to Chairman Mao without leaving his side; one goal: to build railways for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. Finally, we greatly advanced and exceeded the completion of various construction tasks.

In the course of the struggle, we deeply felt that: adhering to the Party's centralized and unified leadership, uniting under the command of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, many units, departments, and individuals can form a fist. The army will have a strong combat effectiveness, and the masses will become a true iron wall. The theory of "mainly relying on the spontaneous movement of the masses" and "the masses should do as they please" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev is extremely absurd and reactionary. If we fall for his tricks, everyone will do as they please, each will act independently, and each will act on their own. Wouldn't that be chaotic? Wouldn't that deviate from the path of Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line! Where would our proletarian army have the invincible and unconquerable combat effectiveness? Here, we can clearly see that the Chinese Khrushchev's evil intentions in spreading anarchism and rightist splittism are extremely malicious.

In the practice of upholding democratic centralism, we deeply felt that: within the Party, not only should there be democracy, but especially there should be centralism. The Party's democracy is under centralized guidance. Promoting Party democracy is not to weaken the Party's centralized and unified leadership, but precisely to strengthen the Party's centralized and unified leadership. Our Party is a proletarian party, and our Party's democracy must serve the interests of the proletariat and be conducive to achieving our Party's struggle tasks. The Chinese Khrushchev distorts the Party's centralism into personal dictatorship, attempting to establish his counter-revolutionary revisionist rule within the Party, while at the same time promoting bourgeois democracy within the Party and implementing bourgeois liberalization. His purpose for these evil activities is only one: to pave the way for the capitalist restoration activities of the handful of capitalist roaders, traitors, and spies within the Party headed by him; to issue "passes" for all ghosts and demons to engage in counterattacks, conspiracies, and attempts to change the system. We must remember Chairman Mao's teachings and always uphold the Party's democratic centralism, thoroughly expose and criticize the Chinese Khrushchev's heinous crimes of destroying the Party's democratic centralism. We must resolutely carry out all the orders of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, unify our thinking, unify our steps, and unify our actions. Wherever Chairman Mao points, we will fight there, and in the struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we will create new achievements!

    坚决维护党在毛泽东思想基础上的集中统一
    中共铁道兵某部机械连支部委员会
    民主集中制是我们党的组织原则，是群众路线在党内生活中的运用，是贯彻执行毛主席革命路线，巩固无产阶级专政的可靠保证。
    中国赫鲁晓夫用偷天换日的恶劣手法，从根本上歪曲和篡改党的民主集中制。他一方面反对无产阶级的民主制，推行“驯服工具”论，宣扬奴隶主义；另一方面反对无产阶级的集中制，强调群众的自发运动，散布无政府主义，鼓吹右倾分裂主义。两种货色，一个目的，就是反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想，反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，推行反革命修正主义路线，妄想把我们党变成修正主义的党，变成法西斯党，以达到他篡党、篡国，复辟资本主义的罪恶目的。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“要党有力量，依靠实行党的民主集中制去发动全党的积极性。”“无论在军队或在地方，党内民主都应是为着巩固纪律和增强战斗力，而不是削弱这种纪律和战斗力。”依靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，依靠毛主席一贯倡导的民主集中制，在我国历次革命斗争中，极大地调动了广大党员和人民群众的积极性，战胜了强大的国内外敌人，保证革命取得了一个又一个的伟大胜利。中国赫鲁晓夫完全懂得：民主集中制是党和国家的根本制度，是他推行修正主义路线、复辟资本主义的极大障碍。因此，他处心积虑地阴谋从根本上取消党在毛泽东思想基础上的集中统一领导，分裂我们的革命队伍，松懈我们的革命纪律，破坏无产阶级的革命权威。我们就是要以毛泽东思想为武器，坚持和捍卫党的民主集中制，保证党在毛泽东思想基础上的集中统一领导。
    我们连队党支部遵照毛主席的教导，在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中，坚持党的民主集中制，使党支部建设不断加强，连队沿着毛主席的革命路线不断前进，连续七年被评为四好连队。有一次，我们连队分散在从内蒙古草原到长江两岸的三个省、区的十一个工地上执行机械施工任务，人员、机械高度分散，任务非常繁重。在这种情况下，是坚持党的民主集中制，加强集体领导呢？还是各自为政，都“以我为中心”呢？这决不是个工作方法问题，而是要不要坚持党的集中统一领导，要不要在以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部统一领导之下，坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的问题。认识到这个问题的重要意义，我们就及时召开了支委会，认真学习了毛主席关于党的民主集中制、党的纪律的论述。经过学习，大家认识到：没有党的集中统一领导，军队就没有战斗力，也就谈不到巩固和发展革命的胜利。自觉地、认真地、严格地按照民主集中制的原则办事，是忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席革命路线、忠于以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的一个重要标志，是无产阶级坚强党性的表现。支委会统一了思想后，在执行任务过程中，各个支部委员都坚决贯彻执行支部决议，遇到问题就坚决按照毛主席的教导办事，按照支委会的意见处理，不自作主张，擅自决定问题。由于坚持党的集体领导，维护党的集中统一，保证了全连人员更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗。从形式上看，支委会的成员、全连的干部战士都分散执行任务，但是，思想上保持了高度的集中统一。大家都做到：荒山僻野不嫌艰苦，冰天雪地不畏严寒，炎夏烈日不怕酷热，工作繁重不叫困难。大家一个心眼：身离北京千山万水，心贴毛主席寸步不离；一个目标：为了中国革命和世界革命修铁路。终于大大提前和超额完成了各项施工任务。
    在斗争实践中，我们深深体会到：坚持党的集中统一领导，统一在以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的号令下，许多单位、部门、个人才能形成一个拳头，军队才有坚强的战斗力，人民群众才能成为真正的铜墙铁壁。中国赫鲁晓夫极力鼓吹的“主要依靠群众的自发运动”，“群众要怎么办就怎么办”，是十分荒谬的反动理论。如果上了他的当，大家爱怎么干就怎么干，各行其是，各自为政，不就乱套了，那不就成了一盘散沙！那不就要背离毛泽东思想和毛主席革命路线的轨道！我们无产阶级的军队那里还会有无坚不摧、无攻不克的战斗力。在这里，我们可以清楚看出，中国赫鲁晓夫极力散布无政府主义、右倾分裂主义的反动谬论，猖狂反对和破坏党的民主集中制的狼子野心是十分恶毒的。
    在坚持民主集中制的实践中，我们深深体会到：党内不但要民主，尤其要集中。党的民主是在集中指导下的民主。发扬党的民主，目的不是要削弱党的集中统一，而正是为了加强党的集中统一。我们党是无产阶级的政党，我们党的民主，必须服从无产阶级的利益，有利于实现我们党的斗争任务。中国赫鲁晓夫把党的集中，篡改为个人独裁，妄图在党内建立他的反革命修正主义的统治，同时又在党内推行资产阶级民主，实行资产阶级自由化。他搞这些罪恶活动的目的只有一个，就是要为以他为首的党内一小撮走资派、叛徒、特务进行资本主义复辟活动大开绿灯；为一切牛鬼蛇神搞反攻倒算、阴谋变天的活动开
  “通行证”。我们要牢记毛主席的教导，永远坚持维护党的民主集中制，彻底揭露和批判中国赫鲁晓夫破坏党的民主集中制的滔天罪行。坚决执行以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的一切号令，统一认识，统一步伐，统一行动，毛主席指到那里，我们就战斗到那里，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的斗争中立新功！
