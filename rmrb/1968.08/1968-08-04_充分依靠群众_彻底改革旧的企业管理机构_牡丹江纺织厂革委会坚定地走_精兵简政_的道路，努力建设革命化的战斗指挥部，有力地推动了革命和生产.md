The revolutionary committee of Mudanjiang Textile Mill in Heilongjiang Province has been following the latest instructions of Chairman Mao, who said, "Revolutionary committees should implement unified leadership, break down overlapping administrative structures, streamline and reduce bureaucracy, and organize a revolutionary leadership team that is connected with the masses." The committee has mobilized the masses to thoroughly reform the old enterprise management structure, resolutely taken the path of streamlining and reducing bureaucracy, and striven to build a revolutionary command center that is connected with the masses. This has powerfully promoted the development of the revolution and production throughout the mill. In May of this year, the mill's total output exceeded the state plan by 46 percent, and the average daily output increased by 79 percent compared to the first quarter. In June and July, the mill's output continued to rise, and the situation became better and better.

Mudanjiang Textile Mill is one of the largest textile enterprises in Heilongjiang Province. In the past, a small clique of capitalist roaders within the party stubbornly pushed the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of Khrushchev, advocating "one-man management" and "expert management," and set up a massive management structure. Following Chairman Mao's great teachings on streamlining and reducing bureaucracy, the mill's revolutionary committee resolutely reformed the old management structure, merging the original 32 management units into three departments, one committee, and one office (Political Department, Production Command Department, Logistics Department, Military Affairs Committee, and Office). The number of management personnel was reduced from the original 303 to 97, reducing the proportion of management personnel in the total workforce from 7.2 percent to 2.5 percent. Recently, they have studied the experience of the Lingbao County Revolutionary Committee and the important editorial note in the People's Daily, and are preparing to further streamline.

The streamlining and reduction of bureaucracy at Mudanjiang Textile Mill was the result of a sharp and complex class struggle. After the revolutionary committee was established in January this year, it initially used the old management structure to carry out work. The cumbersome old structure and its bureaucratic habits obstructed the committee's connection with the masses, making it difficult for the committee to carry out many of its tasks. The exposure of this contradiction made the committee realize that the old structure must be thoroughly reformed. However, at the beginning, some leading members were hesitant to carry out a thorough reform of the old structure. They were afraid of chaos, afraid of difficulties, and afraid of making mistakes, advocating minor adjustments and designating a few people to draft a reform plan. As a result, the streamlining work had been going on for two or three months without any results. With the help of the PLA propaganda team stationed at the mill, the committee studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "Only by destroying the old and rotten things can we build new and healthy things," realizing that the reform of the old structure must not be done through reformist methods but must adopt a thorough revolutionary attitude, resolutely taking the path of streamlining and reducing bureaucracy to organize a new revolutionary management structure.

Chairman Mao teaches, "Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction is criticism and revolution. Destruction must be done with reason, and reason is construction. With destruction as the starting point, construction is also within it." Following Chairman Mao's great teachings, the mill's revolutionary committee mobilized the masses to launch a fierce criticism of Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the construction of political power and to eliminate its poisonous influence. Through the revolutionary criticism, the broad masses of revolutionary workers further realized that the old management structure was serving Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, and its main crimes were: (1) emphasizing business over proletarian politics; (2) relying on "experts" rather than the masses; (3) having too many people doing too little work, not serving the grassroots production; (4) emphasizing constraints rather than cooperation, with overly detailed divisions of labor, leading to mutual obstruction. Through the revolutionary criticism, everyone gained a deeper understanding of Chairman Mao's great teachings on the construction of revolutionary committees. From top to bottom, there was a strong demand for thorough revolution. With the improvement of ideological understanding, the pace of streamlining the structure also accelerated significantly, and in just two weeks, the revolutionary committee began to break free from the old structure and took a big step forward in the direction of revolution and connection with the masses.

After breaking down the cumbersome old structure, how to build a new structure, and who to rely on to build the new structure? The mill's revolutionary committee reviewed and summarized the lessons of the previous period of closed-door reform by a few people, realizing that without mobilizing all the revolutionary workers in the mill, it would be impossible to establish a new revolutionary management structure. Therefore, they decided to put this major issue up for discussion among the workers and to thoroughly follow the mass line.

Following Chairman Mao's great teachings, the revolutionary committee first conducted education among the broad masses of workers on the great significance of streamlining and reducing bureaucracy, making everyone realize that whether or not to implement streamlining and reducing bureaucracy is a major issue concerning the implementation of which line and the path to take. After the broad masses of workers raised their awareness, they actively contributed their ideas for building a revolutionary new structure and proposed many construction plans. The mill's revolutionary committee and the workers, following Chairman Mao's teachings on streamlining and reducing bureaucracy to "achieve the five goals of streamlining, unification, efficiency, economy, and anti-bureaucracy," conducted a thorough comparison and discussion of various plans and then determined the plan for building the new structure. After the new structure was determined, to do a good job of selecting cadres, they organized the broad masses of workers to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's five conditions for successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution and Vice Chairman Lin Biao's three criteria for selecting cadres, and conducted a thorough discussion on the issue of cadre selection.

While mobilizing the workers to discuss, the revolutionary committee, to solve the problem of cadres' ideological understanding of streamlining the structure, held Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They also conducted in-depth and detailed ideological education for cadres through symposiums and individual talks. After most cadres raised their awareness, they voluntarily applied to go to the workshops to participate in production and work at the most difficult posts. The mill's revolutionary committee made reasonable arrangements for this, allowing most cadres who went to the workshops to continue to play a leading role on the production front. Cadres who remained in the new management structure also greatly strengthened their mass consciousness through this reform, actively going deep among the masses, connecting with the masses, and strengthening the relationship between cadres and the masses.

Following Chairman Mao's teachings that "Our party, if it does not have a large number of new cadres working together with the old cadres, our cause will be interrupted," the revolutionary committee, in the process of reforming the structure, launched a fierce criticism of conservatism, broke through the resistance of the old forces, and selected many outstanding proletarian revolutionary fighters from among the workers to fill the new structure, making the members of the leadership teams at all levels and the general cadres achieve a combination of new and old. At present, the mill has seen a new situation where new and old revolutionary cadres learn from each other, help each other, complement each other's strengths and weaknesses, and jointly take good care of power for the proletariat.

The question of relying on whom to manage the enterprise has always been the focus of the struggle between the two classes and the two lines in enterprise management. Chairman Mao pointed out long ago: "In urban struggles, ... we must wholeheartedly rely on the working class." In the past, a small clique of capitalist roaders within the party of Mudanjiang Textile Mill had always pushed Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line of relying on "experts" for production and technology. These so-called "experts" included some bourgeois intellectuals, remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. They monopolized the technical power of the mill, suppressed and oppressed the workers' enthusiasm. In the reform of the management structure, the revolutionary committee, based on the opinions of the broad revolutionary workers, resolutely adjusted the technical team and seized the technical power of production from the hands of the bourgeois reactionary "authorities."

However, there was initially some debate on this issue. Some people said, "The technical team cannot be adjusted. Such a large mill, without a few technical 'authorities,' how can it work?" The revolutionary committee believed this to be a sharp struggle between the two classes and the two lines. If only the structure is changed and not the ideology, and the poison of Khrushchev's "expert management" is not thoroughly eliminated, there is always the possibility of capitalist restoration. Therefore, they mobilized the masses to launch a fierce criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of "expert management," exposing the crimes of those reactionary technical "authorities" who opposed the revolution and sabotaged production.

After the reactionary technical "authorities" were removed from their positions, who would manage the mill's production technology? Could it be managed well? The broad masses of workers and revolutionary technical personnel said, "The revolutionary committee is determined to carry out a thorough revolution, and we have the confidence to manage the enterprise well!" Now, some workshops, following the principle of "two participations, one reform, and three combinations," have formed technical groups composed mainly of old workers, with the participation of revolutionary technical personnel and revolutionary cadres, fully unleashing the creativity of the workers, and continuously producing results in technological innovation and technological revolution.

　　充分依靠群众　彻底改革旧的企业管理机构
    牡丹江纺织厂革委会坚定地走“精兵简政”的道路，努力建设革命化的战斗指挥部，有力地推动了革命和生产
    据新华社哈尔滨三日电　黑龙江省牡丹江纺织厂革命委员会遵照伟大领袖毛主席“革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子”的最新指示，放手发动群众，彻底改革旧的企业管理机构，坚决走“精兵简政”的道路，努力建设起一个革命化的联系群众的战斗指挥部，有力地推动了全厂革命和生产的发展。今年五月份，全厂总产值超额百分之四十六完成国家计划，平均日产量比第一季度提高百分之七十九。六、七两月份，全厂产量继续上升，形势越来越好。
    牡丹江纺织厂是黑龙江省较大的纺织企业。过去，厂里党内一小撮走资派顽固推行中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，大搞“一长制”、“专家治厂”，设置了庞大的管理机构。遵照毛主席关于“精兵简政”的伟大教导，工厂革委会坚决改革旧的管理机构，将原来的三十二个管理单位合并为三部一委一办（政治部、生产指挥部、后勤部、武装委员会、办公室），管理干部由原来的三百零三人减少到九十七人，使管理干部占职工总数的比例由原来的百分之七点二降为百分之二点五。最近，他们认真学习了灵宝县革委会的经验和《人民日报》的重要编者按，还准备进一步实行精简。
    牡丹江纺织厂实行“精兵简政”，是经过一场尖锐复杂的阶级斗争的。这个厂在今年一月建立了革命委员会以后，当时革委会还利用原来的管理机构进行工作。庞杂的旧机构及其官僚主义习气，阻碍着革委会同群众的联系，使革委会很多工作不能顺利进行。这个矛盾的暴露，使革委会认识到，对旧机构必须进行彻底改革。但是，开始时有些领导成员对彻底改革旧机构下不了决心。他们一怕乱，二怕难，三怕错，主张修修补补，指定少数人设计了一个改革方案。这样，精简工作进行了两三个月，还不见成效。革委会在驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，带着这个问题认真学习了毛主席关于
  “只有破坏旧的腐朽的东西，才能建设新的健全的东西”的伟大教导，认识到改革旧机构决不能用改良的办法，必须采取彻底革命的态度，坚决走“精兵简政”的道路，组织起新的革命化的管理机构。
    毛主席教导说：“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。破，就要讲道理，讲道理就是立，破字当头，立也就在其中了。”工厂革委会遵照毛主席这一伟大教导，放手发动群众，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面推行的反革命修正主义路线，肃清其流毒。通过革命大批判，广大革命职工进一步认识到，旧的管理机构是为中国赫鲁晓夫推行反革命修正主义路线服务的，它的主要罪状是：（一）突出业务，不要无产阶级政治；（二）只靠“专家”，不要群众；（三）人浮于事，不为基层生产服务；（四）强调制约，不要协作，分工过细，互相扯皮。通过革命大批判，大家更加深刻地领会了毛主席关于革命委员会建设的伟大教导。全厂从上到下，都有了彻底革命的强烈要求。思想认识提高了，精简机构的进度也大大加速，仅在两个星期内，就使革委会开始跳出原来旧机构的圈子，朝着革命化的联系群众的方向前进了一大步。
    打破庞杂的旧机构以后，怎样建设新机构，依靠谁来建设新机构？工厂革委会检查、总结了前一段只靠少数人闭门改革的失败教训，认识到如果不把全厂革命职工发动起来，就不可能建立新的革命化的管理机构。因此，他们决定把这个重大问题交给工人群众讨论，彻底走群众路线。
    革委会遵照毛主席的伟大教导，首先向广大工人群众进行了关于“精兵简政”重大意义的教育，使大家认识到实行不实行“精兵简政”，是关系到执行什么路线和走什么道路的大问题。广大工人群众提高认识以后，都积极地为建设革命化的新机构献计献策，提出了许多建设方案。工厂革委会和工人群众遵照毛主席关于实行精兵简政“必须达到精简、统一、效能、节约和反对官僚主义五项目的”的教导，对各种方案进行了充分的比较和讨论，然后确定了建设新机构的方案。新机构确定以后，为了做好选送干部的工作，又组织广大工人群众反复学习了毛主席提出的无产阶级革命事业接班人的五项条件和林彪副主席提出的选拔干部的三项标准，对干部的选拔问题进行了充分的讨论。
    革委会在发动工人群众进行讨论的同时，为了解决干部对精简机构的思想认识问题，举办了毛泽东思想学习班。他们还通过座谈会和个别谈心，对干部进行深入细致的思想教育。大多数干部提高觉悟以后，纷纷申请下班组参加生产劳动，到最艰苦的岗位上去工作。工厂革委会对此作了合理安排，使大多数下班组的干部在生产第一线继续发挥骨干作用。留在新的管理机构工作的干部，通过这次改革也大大增强了群众观念，主动深入群众，联系群众，密切了干部和群众的关系。
    工厂革委会遵照毛主席“我们党如果没有广大的新干部同老干部一致合作，我们的事业就会中断”的教导，在改革机构工作中，狠批了保守主义，击破了旧势力的抵抗，从工人群众中选拔了许多优秀的无产阶级革命派战士充实到新机构中来，使各级领导班子的成员到一般干部都实现了新老结合。目前，全厂出现了新老革命干部互相学习，互相帮助，取长补短，共同为无产阶级掌好权的新局面。
    依靠什么人办企业？一直是企业管理中两个阶级、两条路线斗争的焦点。毛主席早就指出：“在城市斗争中，……我们必须全心全意地依靠工人阶级”。过去，牡丹江纺织厂党内一小撮走资派一直推行中国赫鲁晓夫的生产技术靠“专家”的反革命修正主义路线。这些所谓“专家”，有的是资产阶级知识分子，有的是国民党反动派的残渣余孽和地、富、反、坏、右分子。他们垄断工厂技术大权，打击和压制工人的积极性。在改革管理机构中，革委会根据广大革命职工的意见，坚决调整了技术队伍，从资产阶级反动技术“权威”手中夺回了生产技术大权。
    但是，开始时对这个问题是有争论的。有的人说：“技术班子可不能调整，这么大个厂，没有几个技术‘权威’哪能行？”革委会认为这是两个阶级、两条路线的尖锐斗争，如果只从机构上改，不从思想上破，不彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫“专家治厂”的流毒，就随时有可能出现资本主义复辟。于是，他们发动群众狠批“专家治厂”的反革命修正主义路线，大揭那些反动技术“权威”敌视革命、破坏生产的罪行。
    反动技术“权威”被赶下台以后，工厂生产技术由谁来管？能不能管好？广大工人群众和革命技术人员说：“革委会有决心彻底革命，我们有信心把企业管好！”现在，有些车间按照“两参一改三结合”的方针，组成了以老工人为主，有革命技术人员、革命干部参加的三结合技术小组，使工人的创造性得到了充分发挥，技术革新、技术革命成果不断涌现。
