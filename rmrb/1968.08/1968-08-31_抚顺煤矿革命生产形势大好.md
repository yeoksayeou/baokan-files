	Fushun Coal Mine's revolutionary production situation is excellent. With the strong assistance of the People's Liberation Army's support-leftist troops, the broad revolutionary workers of Fushun Coal Mine have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, seriously implemented Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, and achieved one great victory after another in the great struggle of seizing the revolution and promoting production.

	At present, the situation of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in the Fushun mining area is better than ever. The Fushun Mining Bureau and its five major mines and ten factories have all established revolutionary committees. On the basis of the increasingly consolidated and developed revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary three-in-one combination, coal production throughout the bureau has been rising steadily. The average daily output of raw coal in the second quarter of this year increased by 70.17% compared to the first quarter. Since August, the average daily output of raw coal has increased by 44.1% compared to the second quarter. Several major production indicators such as excavation, stripping, and coal washing have all seen significant improvements.

    抚顺煤矿革命生产形势大好
    抚顺煤矿的广大革命职工，在人民解放军支左部队的大力帮助下，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，认真落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，在抓革命、促生产的伟大斗争中夺取了一个又一个巨大胜利。
    现在，抚顺矿区无产阶级文化大革命的形势空前大好。抚顺矿务局及所属五大矿、十大厂已全部成立了革命委员会。在革命大联合和革命三结合日益巩固和发展的基础上，全局煤炭生产节节上升。今年二季度全局原煤平均日产量比第一季度猛增了百分之七十点一七，八月份以来原煤平均日产量又比第二季度提高了百分之四十四点一，掘进、剥离、选煤等几个主要生产指标都有大幅度提高。
