To the Editor:

The great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: "To achieve a proletarian educational revolution, the working class must take the lead." This is the greatest trust and concern that the great leader Chairman Mao has shown towards us, the working class. We shout a thousand and ten thousand times: Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!

The proletarian educational revolution needs the leadership of the working class, and we, the working class, are fully capable of leading.

Some people say, "The working class doesn't understand education." This is sheer nonsense. In our factory, there is a type of radio testing instrument. Previously, an engineer who graduated from university before liberation led a few technicians, and they couldn't complete it in three and a half years. After the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began, this new product was handed over to the workshop for trial production. Under the leadership of the master craftsmen, two design items and one process were modified, and it was successfully trial-produced in just two months. Another project, the trial production of a four-digit display, was also successfully designed with the help of master craftsmen assisting young technicians. This trial production team, under the leadership of the master craftsmen, first studied Chairman Mao's works and the latest directives from Chairman Mao. The master craftsmen led the young technicians to work, design, and improve simultaneously. In just over four months, they successfully trial-produced five prototype machines, which were appraised by relevant departments and received high praise. The technicians we, the working class, have personally trained are both capable of labor and design, and are socially conscious and cultured laborers. In contrast, many of those trained in schools dominated by the bourgeoisie despise labor, can talk but can't do. What use are such people!

"You don't understand the situation in our schools." We workers say: "We understand your situation best. You don't act according to Mao Zedong Thought, you are entangled by bourgeois factionalism, and you are protecting the enemy. Precisely because we understand this basic situation in your schools, our workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams have entered the schools."

Whoever does not listen to Chairman Mao's words and does not act according to Chairman Mao's directives, we workers will intervene!

We, the working class, must lead everything. The phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals dominating schools must not continue. We, the working class, not only will intervene but will definitely manage well. No matter what kind of school it is, if it does not conform to Mao Zedong Thought, we will criticize it and reform it. We, the working class, will definitely transform the world according to the proletarian worldview.

### 工人阶级一定要领导一切

专栏：革命群众来信

    工人阶级一定要领导一切编辑同志：
    伟大领袖毛主席指出：“实现无产阶级教育革命，必须有工人阶级领导”。这是伟大领袖毛主席对我们工人阶级的最大信任，最大关怀。我们千遍万遍地欢呼：毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！
    无产阶级教育革命需要工人阶级领导，我们工人阶级完全能够领导。
    有人说“工人阶级不懂教育”，这完全是胡说八道。我厂生产的一种无线电测试仪器，过去由一个解放前在大学毕业的工程师领导几个技术人员，搞了三年半，也没搞成。无产阶级文化大革命开始后，把这个新产品放到车间去试制，在老师傅领导下，修改了两项设计、一项工艺，仅仅用了两个月的时间就试制成功了。另一项四位数字表的试制工作，也是由老师傅帮助青年技术人员设计成功的。这个试制小组，在老师傅的领导下，首先学习毛主席著作，学习毛主席最新指示。老师傅带领青年技术人员，边劳动，边设计，边改进，用了四个多月的时间就试制成功了五台样机，经有关部门鉴定，受到好评。我们工人阶级亲自培养的技术人员又能劳动，又能设计，是有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。过去资产阶级知识分子统治的学校培养出来的许多人，则是轻视劳动，能说不能干。这样的人有什么用！
    “你们不了解我们学校的斗争情况。”我们工人说：“我们最了解你们的情况，你们不按照毛泽东思想办事，被资产阶级派性缠住了，掩护了敌人。正因为我们了解你们学校这个基本情况，我们工人毛泽东思想宣传队才开进学校来了。”
    谁不听毛主席的话，不按照毛主席的指示办事，我们工人就要管！
    我们工人阶级就是要领导一切，资产阶级知识分子统治学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了。我们工人阶级不但要管，而且一定能管好，不管是什么学校，凡是不符合毛泽东思想的，我们都要批判，都要改革。我们工人阶级一定要按照无产阶级世界观改造世界。
