The workers of the Fuxin Power Plant, with the help of the People's Liberation Army propaganda team stationed at the plant, have been resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production" during the past two and a half years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They have completed their power generation tasks excellently every year and every month. They have also achieved remarkable results in technological innovation and technological revolution, solving the so-called "old and difficult" problems that have long been considered unsolvable, and greatly promoting production. In the one and a half years of 1967 and the first half of this year, the plant saved the state more than 330 ten thousand yuan.

Fuxin Power Plant is one of China's large thermal power plants. In the past, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party vigorously promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of managing enterprises advocated by Liu Shaoqi, peddling the black goods of "money as the commander," "material incentives," and "technology first." They colluded with bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities" to implement "expert management," using a set of capitalist and revisionist old institutions and foreign frameworks to shackle the hands and feet of workers and suppress the socialist enthusiasm of revolutionary workers. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary workers of this plant responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "concern yourselves with national affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end." They held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and waged a fierce struggle against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party. In the fierce class struggle, they have always guarded their production posts and ensured the completion of production tasks. Revolutionary workers proudly declared, "For the sake of defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, we will face any difficulty and bear any burden. We will grasp revolution and promote production, and we will not be shaken by storms and tempests." A veteran worker and Communist Party member in the fuel division, in order to smash the enemy's plot to sabotage the revolution and production, worked despite his illness, rushed to unload frozen coal, and fought continuously for more than twenty hours, several times fainting and then continuing the battle. Many revolutionary workers voluntarily guarded the power plant day and night to prevent the enemy's sabotage.

During the past two and a half years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary workers of this plant have always remembered Chairman Mao's teaching, "Our present task on the ideological front is to carry out a criticism of revisionism." They have held high the great banner of criticizing revisionism with Mao Zedong Thought, fiercely criticizing Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line of managing enterprises, and launching continuous attacks on a handful of class enemies. The entire plant has set up revolutionary criticism battlefields everywhere. Revolutionary workers, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, have carried out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism. Class struggle and the struggle between the two lines have reached an unprecedented height.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has powerfully promoted the development of production. A wave of mass technological innovation and technological revolution has risen. The shortage of water in the dry season is a long-standing "old and difficult" problem for this power plant. Workers proposed recycling waste water to solve the problem several years ago, but bourgeois reactionary technical "authorities" paid no attention. At the beginning of this year, revolutionary workers, with the great, fearless spirit of the proletariat, finally completed the waste water recycling project, making waste water reusable, completely reversing the passive situation of production shortage, and saving the state a large amount of money. In the revolutionary criticism, they also successfully developed an installation, making the water softening treatment technology reach the world's advanced level. In the past two years, under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, revolutionary workers have implemented more than 250 technological innovation and technological revolution projects, of which 32 are major projects.

    无产阶级文化大革命是生产发展的强大推动力
    阜新发电厂两年来月月出色完成发电任务
    实现了二百五十多项技术革新和技术革命项目，软化水处理的技术达到世界先进水平
    据新华社沈阳二十一日电　阜新发电厂广大革命职工，在驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，坚决贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，在两年多来的无产阶级文化大革命中，年年月月出色地完成发电任务。在技术革新和技术革命方面也取得了显著成就，解决了多年来一直被认为无法解决的“老大难”问题，极大地促进了生产。在一九六七年和今年上半年一年半的时间内，这个厂为国家节约了三百三十多万元资金。
    阜新发电厂是我国大型火力发电厂之一。过去，党内一小撮走资派极力推行中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义办企业路线，大肆贩卖“金钱挂帅”、“物质刺激”、“技术第一”等黑货。他们伙同资产阶级反动技术“权威”，实行
  “专家治厂”，用一套资本主义、修正主义的旧制度、洋框框，束缚工人的手脚，压抑革命职工的社会主义积极性。在无产阶级文化大革命中，这个厂的广大革命职工坚决响应毛主席“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的伟大号召，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大造了党内一小撮走资派的反。在激烈的阶级斗争中，他们一直坚守生产岗位，坚决保证生产任务的完成。革命职工豪迈地表示，为了保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，天大困难我们顶，万斤重担我们挑，抓革命，促生产，狂风暴雨不动摇。燃料分厂有一位老工人、共产党员，为了粉碎阶级敌人破坏革命和生产的阴谋，带病坚持工作，突击卸冻煤，连续奋战二十几个小时，几次昏倒过去，醒来又继续战斗。许多革命职工自动日夜守卫发电厂，防止阶级敌人的破坏。
    在两年多来的无产阶级文化大革命中，这个厂的广大革命职工，牢记毛主席“我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判”的教导，高举毛泽东思想的革命批判大旗，狠揭猛批中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义办企业路线，不间断地向一小撮阶级敌人发起猛攻。全厂处处摆开了革命大批判的战场，广大革命职工以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，深入持久地开展革命大批判，阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟空前提高。
    无产阶级文化大革命有力地推动了生产的发展。群众性的技术革新和技术革命的热潮掀起来了。旱季缺水，是这个发电厂的一个“老大难”问题，工人们几年前就提出回收废水来解决，资产阶级反动技术“权威”根本不理睬。今年年初，革命职工发扬无产阶级的大无畏的革命精神，终于完成了废水回收工程，使废水重新被利用，彻底扭转了生产缺水的被动局面，并可为国家节约大量资金。在革命大批判中，他们还试制成功了一项装置，使软化水处理的技术达到了世界先进水平。两年来，广大革命职工在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，实现了二百五十多项技术革新和技术革命项目，其中重大项目有三十二项。
