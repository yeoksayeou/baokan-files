The capitalist world economy is continuing to deteriorate. The United States has experienced three consecutive trade deficits this year.

According to figures released by the U.S. Department of Commerce on July 29, the United States' foreign trade deficit continued for the second month in June, with a deficit of $87.2 million (the deficit in May was $32 million).

Including the deficit in March, which was the first in five years, this is the third trade deficit the United States has experienced in the first half of this year. A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Commerce admitted dejectedly that this situation is "troubling."

	The number of unemployed in the U.S. surged to 3.6 million in June

According to figures released by the U.S. Department of Labor, which were obviously reduced, the number of unemployed in the United States increased by 1.3 million in June compared to May, reaching a total of 3.6 million. All of these newly unemployed are either under 20 years old or between 20 and 24 years old.

	French industrial production fell by 32% in May

According to the French National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies, the people's struggle in May heavily struck France's capitalist economy, causing French industrial production to drop by 32.5%. The most severely affected sectors include metallurgy, petroleum, gas, electricity, and construction.

	Large numbers of French youth face unemployment and lack of education

The French newspaper "Paris Today" published an article titled "Youth Face Unemployment" revealing that currently, France has over 5 million youth aged 14 to 20. Among them, 2.8 million cannot attend school, and 250,000 are unemployed. Especially severe are the situations of workers' children and those from low-income families who face unemployment and lack of education.

	Australia's national debt exceeds 100 billion Australian dollars

Australia, which has steadfastly supported the U.S. imperialist war in Vietnam, is experiencing worsening economic conditions. Currently, the national debt has reached 106.3 billion Australian dollars. Inflation is severe; in 1931, the currency was worth 1 billion Australian dollars, but by 1966, it had increased to 8.86 billion Australian dollars, and now it has reached 10 billion Australian dollars. The retail price index was 138 in 1932, but by 1966, it had risen to 517, increasing severalfold.

	Serious unemployment under India's reactionary rule

According to recent estimates by the Indian reactionary government, India currently has approximately 10 million unemployed. Even Indian bourgeois newspapers admit that this number is significantly understated. In recent years, the number of unemployed workers in India has rapidly increased. In March 1956, there were 5.3 million unemployed; by March 1961, this number had increased to 7.5 million.

The ranks of unemployed intellectuals in India are also growing rapidly. As of June 1961, there were over 560,000 intellectuals registered in "employment agencies" seeking jobs; by the end of 1967, this number had surged to over 1.08 million.

    资本主义世界经济不断恶化
    美国对外贸易今年连续出现三次逆差
    据美国商务部七月二十九日公布的数字，六月份美国对外贸易连续第二个月出现逆差；逆差额达到八千七百二十万美元（五月份逆差额为三千二百万美元）。
    连同三月份出现的五年来第一次逆差，这是今年上半年内美国对外贸易出现的第三次逆差。美国商务部发言人沮丧地承认，这种情况“令人困恼”。
        美失业人数六月份猛增到三百六十万
    据美国劳工部公布的显然缩小了的数字，六月份美国失业人数比五月份猛增一百三十万人，总数达到三百六十万人。这批新增加的失业者，全部为不满二十岁的和二十岁到二十四岁之间的青年。
        法工业生产五月份下降百分之三十二
    据法国国家统计和经济研究所透露，今年五月的人民斗争风暴沉重地打击了法国的资本主义经济，使法国工业生产下降了百分之三十二点五。损失特别严重的是冶金和石油、煤气、电力、建筑等工业。
        法国有大批青年面临失学失业
    法国《今日巴黎报》发表一篇《青年面临失业》的文章透露，目前法国从十四岁到二十岁青年共有五百多万。上不了学的青年有二百八十万，二十五万人找不到工作。特别是工人子女和家庭收入低微的子女遭受失业失学情况最为严重。
        澳大利亚欠的国债高达一百多亿澳元
    死心塌地充当美帝侵越战争帮凶的澳大利亚，经济情况正日益恶化。目前国债已达一百零六亿多澳元。通货膨胀十分严重，一九三一年，通货为一亿澳元，一九六六年已增加到八亿八千六百万澳元，而现在更达到十亿澳元。零售物价指数在一九三二年是一百三十八，而一九六六年为五百一十七，上涨了好几倍。
        印度反动统治下人民的失业情况严重
    据印度反动政府最近估计，印度目前失业人数约达一千万。连印度资产阶级报刊也认为，这个数字是大大缩小了的。近年来印度失业工人的数字急剧增大。一九五六年三月，失业人数为五百三十万；一九六一年三月，失业人数增加到七百五十万。
    印度知识分子的失业队伍也变得愈来愈庞大。仅仅在“职业介绍所”中登记求职的知识分子，一九六一年六月有五十六万多人；一九六七年底激增到一百零八万多人。
