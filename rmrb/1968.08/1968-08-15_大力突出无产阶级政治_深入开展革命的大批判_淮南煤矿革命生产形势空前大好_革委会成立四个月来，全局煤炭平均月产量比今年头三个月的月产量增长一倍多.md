The Huainan Coal Mine Revolutionary Committee has emphasized proletarian politics and focused on class struggle, leading the revolutionary masses to launch a vigorous revolutionary criticism campaign. By using revolution to drive production, the entire mine has achieved an unprecedentedly good revolutionary and production situation, which continues to improve.

The revolutionary workers of Huainan Coal Mine have fully achieved revolutionary unity. The mine bureau's ten mines, three factories, and over a hundred basic units have all established revolutionary committees or revolutionary leadership groups. Coal production has been rising month by month. In the four months since the establishment of the revolutionary committee, the average monthly coal production of the entire mine has more than doubled compared to the first three months of this year.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." Since its establishment in late March this year, the Huainan Coal Mine Revolutionary Committee has emphasized proletarian politics and insisted on leading production with revolution. They have led the revolutionary masses to hold thousands of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They have mobilized the masses to thoroughly expose and criticize the heinous crimes of a handful of top capitalist roaders and their agents in Huainan Coal Mine who incited the masses to fight each other, sabotaged production, and sabotaged the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. At the same time, they have used numerous specific examples to criticize the revisionist goods advocated by a handful of capitalist roaders, such as the theory of "class struggle extinction," "exploitation merits," "money as the leader," "material incentives," and "politics implemented in business."

The revolutionary criticism has promoted the thought revolution of revolutionary workers, accelerated the development of revolutionary unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination throughout the mine. By late July, all the mines, factories, workshops, sections, mining units, production support departments, and offices and schools in Huainan Coal Mine had established revolutionary leadership bodies.

The "Sixteen Points" personally formulated by Chairman Mao point out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a powerful driving force for the development of social productive forces in our country." The Huainan Coal Mine workers, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have directed their boundless revolutionary enthusiasm towards production. Mines and teams have launched a heated revolutionary production competition. Many miners' families have also rushed to contribute to coal production. Many elderly women, after class education, have awakened their socialist consciousness and voluntarily organized underground promotion teams, above-ground cheerleading teams, logistics service teams, and propaganda teams to come to the production site. They hold the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and carry banners that read "Send our loved ones down the mine, welcome our loved ones back victorious," encouraging workers to produce more.

　　大力突出无产阶级政治　深入开展革命的大批判
　　淮南煤矿革命生产形势空前大好
　　革委会成立四个月来，全局煤炭平均月产量比今年头三个月的月产量增长一倍多
    据新华社合肥电　安徽淮南煤矿革命委员会大力突出无产阶级政治，狠抓阶级斗争，带领广大革命群众，展开轰轰烈烈的革命大批判，用革命带动生产，全矿革命、生产形势空前大好，越来越好。
    淮南煤矿的革命职工已经全部实现革命的大联合。矿务局所属的十矿三厂和上百个基层单位，都建立了革命委员会或革命领导小组。煤炭生产月月上升，在革委会成立后的四个月来，全局平均每月的煤炭产量比今年头三个月的煤炭月产量增长一倍多。
    毛主席教导我们：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”淮南煤矿革委会从今年三月下旬成立以后，大力突出无产阶级政治，坚持以革命统帅生产。他们带领广大革命职工，举办了上千期的毛泽东思想学习班，全面落实毛主席的最新指示；发动群众彻底揭露和批判了党内一小撮最大的走资派及其在淮南煤矿的代理人挑动群众斗群众、破坏生产、破坏无产阶级文化大革命的滔天罪行。同时，他们还用大量具体事例，批判了一小撮走资派鼓吹的“阶级斗争熄灭”论和“剥削有功”、“金钱挂帅”、“物质刺激”、“政治落实到业务”等修正主义黑货。革命的大批判，促进了革命职工的思想革命化，促进全矿革命大联合和革命三结合的迅速发展。到七月下旬，淮南煤矿所有的矿井、工厂、车间、工段、采掘单位、生产辅助部门及机关、学校，全部建立了革命领导机构。
    毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”指出：“无产阶级文化大革命是使我国社会生产力发展的一个强大的推动力”。经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的淮南煤矿工人，把冲天的革命干劲用到生产上，矿与矿、队与队之间展开了热火朝天的革命生产竞赛。许多矿工家属，也争着为增产煤炭出力。许多白发苍苍的老大娘，经过阶级教育，激发了社会主义觉悟，自动组织了井下促进队、井上报喜队、后勤服务队、鼓动宣传队来到生产现场，她们手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，打着“送亲人下井，迎亲人凯旋”的标语牌，鼓励工人努力增产。
