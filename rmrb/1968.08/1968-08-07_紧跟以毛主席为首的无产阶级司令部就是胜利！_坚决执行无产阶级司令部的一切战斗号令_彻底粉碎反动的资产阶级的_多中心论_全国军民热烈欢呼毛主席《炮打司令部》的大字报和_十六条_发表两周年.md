Victory Lies in Following the Proletarian Headquarters Led by Chairman Mao!

Firmly Execute All Battle Orders from the Proletarian Headquarters!

Thoroughly Smash the Reactionary Bourgeois "Multi-Center Theory"!

The Nation's Military and Civilians Warmly Celebrate the Second Anniversary of Chairman Mao's "Bombard the Headquarters" Big-Character Poster and the "Sixteen Points"

BEIJING, Aug. 6 (Xinhua) — On the solemn occasion of commemorating the second anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's "Bombard the Headquarters" big-character poster and the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," the nation's hundreds of millions of military and civilians reviewed the great victories achieved in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past two years. They seriously studied the important editorial "Unite Under the Leadership of the Proletarian Headquarters Led by Chairman Mao" published in the People's Daily. This further ignited their boundless love and loyalty to the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Deputy Chairman Lin. The hundreds of millions of military and civilians resolutely declared that they would definitely, under the command of Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters, unify their will, steps, and actions. They would promote the revolutionary academic style of combining theory with practice advocated by Chairman Mao, better study and apply Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, especially Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They would thoroughly criticize the reactionary bourgeois "multi-center theory" and achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

The proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao is the fundamental guarantee for leading us from victory to victory.

The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers across the country reviewed the two-year battle course of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. With boundless joy, they pointed out that the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Deputy Chairman Lin is the headquarters that ensures the socialist state will never change color, that ensures the laboring people will never suffer again, and is the fundamental guarantee for leading us from victory to victory. Following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and all battle orders from the proletarian headquarters means attacking and conquering all, and being invincible in all battles. Everyone expressed that at this moment of achieving comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they must be even more loyal to the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Deputy Chairman Lin. They must unconditionally and resolutely execute all instructions from the proletarian headquarters.

The revolutionary masses and cadres of the revolutionary base area of Jianxi Pinggangshan, personally created by the great leader Chairman Mao, deeply felt through long-term revolutionary struggles that being loyal to Chairman Mao and the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao is the source of strength for the people of Jianxi Pinggangshan to achieve all victories. They said that in the new situation, they must more closely unite around the proletarian headquarters, unify their will, steps, and actions under its command, and achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The revolutionary workers of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, Beijing First Machine Tool Plant, Shanghai First Machine Tool Plant, Nanjing Glass Factory, and Jinan Locomotive Works reviewed their two-year battle journey. Everyone deeply felt that every victory they won shone with the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought. Every victory song was composed by Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and was the result of resolutely executing the great battle orders of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao. They said that battle experience tells us that the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Deputy Chairman Lin is the only headquarters leading us from victory to victory. The working class loves the proletarian headquarters without limit, is loyal to the proletarian headquarters without limit, and firmly follows the proletarian headquarters. At any time and under any circumstances, we will resolutely carry out and thoroughly execute all battle orders from the proletarian headquarters. We firmly oppose the erroneous attitude and bad style of using Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the battle orders from the proletarian headquarters for personal gain. We firmly oppose the despicable practice of saying one thing and doing another.

The soldiers of the "Model Eighth Company on Nanjing Road," the "Red Artillery Company" of the Guangzhou Military Region, and many active learners of Chairman Mao's works from the Wuhan Military Region, combined with the two-year practice of the Cultural Revolution, discussed their deep feelings about following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment leading to victory. They said that following the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao gives us direction and strength. At every critical moment in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Deputy Chairman Lin issued new battle orders to us, pointing out the direction of victory. Our People's Liberation Army is the great people's army personally created and led by Chairman Mao, and directly commanded by Deputy Chairman Lin. It is the strong pillar of the proletarian dictatorship. Defending the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Deputy Chairman Lin to the death is our most sacred duty and highest battle mission. Anyone who dares to oppose the proletarian headquarters, we will resolutely overthrow them!

At this solemn moment of commemorating the second anniversary of Chairman Mao's big-character poster and the "Sixteen Points" personally drafted by Chairman Mao, the workers, peasants, and broad revolutionary masses across the country most resolutely declared that in the great march to achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they must overturn and expose the reactionary bourgeois "multi-center theory," and more closely unite around the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Deputy Chairman Lin. They must unify their will, steps, and actions, and advance victoriously.

The poor and lower-middle peasants of Shazhou Bank, Ruijin County, Jiangxi Province, held a meeting by the red well personally dug by Chairman Mao and the cadres of the revolutionary base area. With boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, they criticized the reactionary "multi-center theory." They said that at this critical moment of achieving comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we swear to the great leader Chairman Mao: In our hearts, there is only the leadership center of the proletarian headquarters led by you and Deputy Chairman Lin. For every instruction issued by the proletarian headquarters, we guarantee to carry it out resolutely and immediately. Anyone who dares to resist the leadership of the proletarian headquarters and disrupt Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, we will resolutely overthrow them.

The responsible comrades of the Shenyang Workers' Congress and the Hohhot Workers' Congress, the revolutionary workers of Guiyang Steel Plant and Guizhou Diesel Engine Plant, at their respective meetings and discussions, said that we have only one leadership center, which is the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Deputy Chairman Lin. No matter how many "centers" the proponents of the "multi-center theory" advocate, in reality, there are only two centers: one is the proletarian center, and the other is the bourgeois center. We firmly support and defend the proletarian leadership center with our lives, and firmly oppose and thoroughly smash the bourgeois "center."

The revolutionary cadres of Shanghai Silicon Steel Sheet Factory criticized the reactionary "multi-center theory" and the erroneous idea of "me-firstism" that interfered with the implementation of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They said that the essence of the "multi-center theory" and "me-firstism" is to want only "my" center and not the center of the proletarian headquarters. Such people only see their own interests, while the interests of the party and the future of the state can all be ignored. They can arbitrarily distort and refuse to execute the series of latest instructions from the proletarian headquarters. If such people are not transformed by Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought and do not thoroughly change their bourgeois worldview, they will eventually fall into a dangerous pit. We revolutionary cadres must constantly use Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought to transform our worldview, truly establish a proletarian worldview that is loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to the invincible Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We will fight for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in life and die for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

The soldiers of the "Model Company of the Love the People" of the Beijing Military Region, the "Model Company of the Battle of Dajian Island" on the front line of Fujian Province, which has won numerous victories under Chairman Mao's leadership, and the soldiers of the "Pioneer Boat at Sea" of the Navy, which is on duty at sea, held celebrations, discussions, and meetings to commemorate the second anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's "Bombard the Headquarters" big-character poster. The soldiers said that the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Deputy Chairman Lin is the only leadership center for the entire party, the entire army, the entire nation, and the broad revolutionary masses. Under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters, we have thoroughly smashed the bourgeois headquarters led by China's Khrushchev and achieved decisive victory in the first Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in human history. We revolutionary soldiers are loyal to the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Deputy Chairman Lin without limit. We will resolutely stand guard and keep watch for the proletarian headquarters for life!

Huazhong Institute of Technology in Wuhan achieved revolutionary great unity in January last year and then established a revolutionary committee in August last year. In this process, the revolutionary Red Guards firmly implemented the various instructions of the proletarian headquarters, opposed the bourgeois factionalism and individualism of "me-firstism," and resisted interference from all sides. The Red Guards reviewed their two-year battle journey and deeply felt that a handful of class enemies always try to use the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideas in our minds to incite us to engage in "me-firstism," attempting to make us deviate from the revolutionary track of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought and deviate from the leadership of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Deputy Chairman Lin. We revolutionary Red Guards must be loyal to the supreme commander Chairman Mao, honestly implement every strategic deployment of the proletarian headquarters, and strive to transform our worldview in revolutionary struggles to truly temper ourselves into successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

Better Strive to Study and Apply the Great Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, Firmly Follow the Strategic Deployment of the Proletarian Headquarters Led by Chairman Mao

Deputy Chairman Lin instructed us: "The attitude towards Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought is a very important issue. We must grasp the issue of attitude towards Chairman Mao and Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought." The military and civilians across the country decided to promote the revolutionary academic style of combining theory with practice advocated by Chairman Mao, better study and apply Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, especially Chairman Mao's series of extremely important latest instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They would use the great Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought to guide all their actions and consciously follow the great strategic deployment of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao.

The broad poor and lower-middle peasants of Lankao County, Henan Province, said that the attitude towards the invincible Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought is the touchstone to distinguish true revolutionaries, verbal revolutionaries, non-revolutionaries, and counter-revolutionaries. Studying and applying is true revolution, studying but not applying is verbal revolution, not studying and not applying is non-revolution, and opposing study and application is counter-revolution. We poor and lower-middle peasants must forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever insist on the revolutionary academic style of learning and applying in unity, and not be verbal revolutionaries. We swear to be true proletarian revolutionaries who will carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

The members of the revolutionary committee of Wuhan Biological Products Research Institute said that our experience in the more than two-year Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution can be summarized in one sentence: following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment is victory. To follow closely, quickly, and well, we must act upon Chairman Mao's instructions, study seriously, and implement resolutely. We deeply feel that studying and applying Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, learning and applying, is boundless. For Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the battle orders from the proletarian headquarters, we must carry them out resolutely and thoroughly execute them. Even if we do not understand them temporarily, we must execute them and deepen our understanding in the process of execution. Only in this way can we unify our will, steps, and actions under the command of the proletarian headquarters and advance victoriously.

The comrades of the revolutionary committee of Xiaoqinghe Navigation Bureau, Shandong Province, said that speaking one way and acting another, saying one thing and meaning another, is the style of bourgeois politicians. Such people pay lip service to Chairman Mao's instructions but do another thing, and even worse, distort the highest instructions for their own interests. If such people do not use Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought to fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism, and do not thoroughly change their bourgeois worldview, they will deviate from and even oppose the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, which is very dangerous.

The fighting heroes of the "Sea Hero Boat" patrolling day and night at the front line of the South China Sea and the soldiers of the advanced collective "Aviation Hero Squadron" of the Air Force studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, with boundless proletarian feelings of loyalty to Chairman Mao, said that loyalty is shown through actions. Loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line must be reflected in actions. We must hold high the great red flag of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, bring problems to study and apply Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, learn in struggles, apply in struggles, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and strive for new achievements in achieving comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    新华社六日讯　在隆重纪念伟大领袖毛主席《炮打司令部》大字报和《中国共产党中央委员会关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》发表两周年的光辉日子里，全国亿万军民回顾两年来无产阶级文化大革命所取得的伟大胜利，认真学习《人民日报》的重要社论《在以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的领导下团结起来》，更加激发了对以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的无限热爱，无限忠诚。亿万军民坚决表示，一定要在毛主席的无产阶级司令部的号令下统一意志，统一步伐，统一行动，发扬毛主席亲自倡导的理论和实际相结合的革命学风，更好地活学活用毛泽东思想，特别是学好用好毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的一系列最新指示，彻底批判反动的资产阶级的“多中心论”，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
    以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，是领导我们从胜利走向胜利的根本保证
    各地广大工农兵群众回顾两年来无产阶级文化大革命的战斗历程，大家怀着无限幸福的心情指出，以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，是永保社会主义江山不变色的司令部，是永保劳动人民不再遭受二遍苦的司令部，是领导我们从胜利走向胜利的最根本保证。紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，紧跟无产阶级司令部的一切战斗号令，就攻无不克，战无不胜。大家表示，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的时刻，一定要对以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部更加无限忠诚，不折不扣地坚决执行无产阶级司令部的一切指示。
    伟大领袖毛主席亲手创造的井冈山革命老根据地的广大革命群众和革命干部，从长期的革命斗争中深切地体会到，无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，这是井冈山儿女取得一切胜利的力量源泉。他们说，在新形势下，我们一定要更加紧密地团结在无产阶级司令部周围，在它的号令下统一意志，统一步伐，统一行动，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    鞍山钢铁公司、北京第一机床厂、上海第一机床厂、南京玻璃厂和济南机车工厂的革命职工，回顾两年来的战斗道路，大家都深深地感到，他们夺得的每一个胜利都闪耀着毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉，每一曲凯歌都是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线谱成，都是坚决执行以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部伟大战斗号令的结果。他们说，斗争经验告诉我们，以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，是唯一领导我们从胜利走向胜利的司令部。我们工人阶级无限热爱无产阶级司令部，无限忠于无产阶级司令部，坚定不移地紧跟无产阶级司令部。在任何时候，在任何情况下，我们对无产阶级司令部的一切战斗号令都坚决照办，彻底执行。坚决反对那种对毛主席的最新指示和无产阶级司令部的战斗号令采取“为我所用”、“各取所需”的错误态度和极坏作风，坚决反对那种口头上高喊坚决照办，行动上另搞一套的阳奉阴违的恶劣做法。
      “南京路上好八连”、广州部队“红色炮兵连”的指战员和武汉部队许多学习毛主席著作积极分子，结合两年来文化大革命的实践，畅谈了紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署就是胜利的深切体会。他们说，紧跟以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部就有方向，就有力量。在无产阶级文化大革命中的每一个关键时刻，以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部都向我们发出了新的战斗号令，给我们指出胜利的方向。我们人民解放军是毛主席亲手缔造、亲自领导，林副主席直接指挥的伟大的人民军队，是无产阶级专政的坚强柱石。誓死保卫以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，是我们最神圣的职责，最高的战斗任务。谁胆敢反对无产阶级司令部，我们就坚决打倒他！
    无限忠于以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，彻底批判反动的资产阶级的“多中心论”
    在隆重纪念毛主席的大字报和毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”发表两周年的时候，各地工农兵和广大革命群众最坚决地表示，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大进军中，一定要把反动的资产阶级的“多中心论”批倒批臭，更紧密地团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部周围，统一意志，统一步伐，统一行动，乘胜前进。
    江西瑞金县沙洲坝的贫下中农，在当年毛主席亲自带领苏区工作人员开挖的红井边举行集会，满怀对毛主席无限忠诚的无产阶级感情，批判了反动的“多中心论”。他们说，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的关键时刻，我们向伟大领袖毛主席宣誓：在我们心里只有以您为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部这个领导中心。对无产阶级司令部发出的每一项指示，我们保证坚决照办，立刻执行。有谁胆敢对抗无产阶级司令部的领导，破坏毛主席的伟大战略部署，我们就坚决打倒他。
    沈阳市工代会和呼和浩特市工代会的负责人，贵阳钢铁厂、贵州柴油机厂的革命工人，在他们各自举行的座谈会、讨论会上说，我们只有一个领导中心，就是以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部。不管“多中心论”者鼓吹有多少个“中心”，其实只有两个中心，一个是无产阶级的，一个是资产阶级的。我们坚决拥护、誓死捍卫无产阶级的领导中心，坚决反对、彻底粉碎资产阶级的“中心”。
    上海矽钢片厂的无产阶级革命派，对干扰毛主席无产阶级革命路线贯彻执行的反动的“多中心论”和“以我为中心”的错误思想，进行了批判。他们说，“多中心论”和“以我为中心”的实质，都是只要“我”的中心，不要无产阶级司令部的中心。这种人，他们眼睛里只看到自己的利益，而党的利益和国家的前途统统可以丢掉不管，对来自无产阶级司令部的一系列最新指示可以任意歪曲，拒不执行。这种人发展下去，总有一天要滑到危险的泥坑里去。我们无产阶级革命派一定要不断用毛泽东思想改造自己的世界观，真正树立起无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于战无不胜的毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席革命路线的无产阶级世界观，生为毛主席革命路线而战斗，死为毛主席的革命路线而献身。
    “爱民模范”谢臣生前所在的北京部队某部，在毛主席的领导下南征北战屡建战功的福建前线“大嶝岛战斗模范连”，正在海上值勤的海军“海上先锋艇”的指战员，分别举行了纪念毛主席《炮打司令部》大字报发表两周年的庆祝会、座谈会、讨论会。指战员们说，以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，是全党、全军、全国和广大革命群众唯一的领导中心。我们在无产阶级司令部的领导下，彻底摧垮了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，取得了人类历史上第一次无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利。我们革命战士对以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部无限忠诚，坚决为捍卫无产阶级司令部站一辈子岗，放一辈子哨！
    武汉华中工学院在去年一月实现了革命大联合，接着在去年八月成立了革命委员会。在这个过程中，革命的红卫兵小将坚决贯彻执行无产阶级司令部的各项指示，反对“以我为中心”的资产阶级山头主义和个人主义，抵制了来自各方面的干扰。红卫兵小将们回顾他们两年来的战斗历程，深有体会地说，一小撮阶级敌人总是千方百计地利用我们头脑中的资产阶级、小资产阶级思想，煽动我们去搞什么“以我为中心”，妄图使我们脱离毛泽东思想的革命轨道，脱离以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的领导。我们革命的红卫兵，只有无限忠于最高统帅毛主席，老老实实地贯彻无产阶级司令部的每一个战略部署，在革命斗争中努力改造世界观，才能把自己真正锻炼成为无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    更好地努力活学活用伟大的毛泽东思想，紧跟以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的战略部署
    林副主席指示我们：“对毛泽东思想抱什么态度，是一个很重要的问题。我们就是要抓对毛主席的态度、对毛泽东思想的态度问题。”各地军民决心发扬毛主席亲自倡导的“理论和实践相结合”的革命学风，更好地活学活用毛泽东思想，特别要学好用好毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的一系列极其重要的最新指示，用伟大的毛泽东思想统帅自己的一切行动，自觉地紧跟以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的伟大战略部署。
    河南省兰考县的广大贫下中农说，对战无不胜的毛泽东思想抱什么态度，是区别真革命、口头革命、不革命和反革命的试金石。活学活用是真革命，光学不用是口头革命，不学不用是不革命，反对学用是反革命。我们贫下中农一定要永远忠于毛主席，永远坚持学用一致的革命学风，不做口头革命派，誓做把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的真正的无产阶级革命派。
    武汉生物制品研究所革命委员会的成员说，我们在两年多来无产阶级文化大革命中的体会，千言万语可以归结成一句话：紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署就是胜利。要跟得紧，跟得快，跟得好，就要对毛主席的指示闻风而动，认真学，坚决做。我们深切地体会到，对毛主席的一系列最新指示，学了就用，力量无穷。对毛主席的最新指示，对无产阶级司令部的战斗号令，就是要坚决照办，彻底执行，理解的要执行，暂时不理解的也要执行，在执行过程中加深理解。只有这样，才能在无产阶级司令部的号令下统一意志，统一步伐，统一行动，乘胜前进。
    山东省小清河航运局革命委员会的同志们说，言行不一，口是心非，这是资产阶级政客作风。这种人对毛主席的指示阳奉阴违，嘴里喊拥护，行动另一套，更恶劣的是歪曲最高指示，为自己的私利服务。这种人如果不用毛泽东思想斗私批修，狠狠改造自己的资产阶级世界观，就会脱离以至对抗以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，那是十分危险的。
    日夜巡逻在南海前哨的战斗英雄麦贤得所在的“海上英雄艇”和空军活学活用毛主席著作先进集体“航空兵英雄中队”的指战员们，怀着无限忠于毛主席的深厚无产阶级感情说，忠不忠看行动。无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的革命路线，必须落实到行动上。我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，带着问题活学活用毛泽东思想，在斗争中学，在斗争中用，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利再立新功。
