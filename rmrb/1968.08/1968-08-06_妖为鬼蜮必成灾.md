Western jazz music is rampantly spreading in the Soviet Union. This is one of the results of the full-scale restoration of capitalism by the Soviet revisionist renegade clique, and it is also a manifestation of the decadence and decline of the new bourgeoisie represented by the likes of Brezhnev and Kosygin.

Jazz music is a vile symbol of modern Western "civilization" and the "American way of life." This vulgar music is despised and rejected by the broad masses of people in capitalist countries, but now it is rampant in the Soviet Union, spreading a nauseating stench. The Soviet revisionist renegade clique not only imports a large amount of Western jazz music but also vigorously promotes and propagates it within the country, allowing this decadent music to occupy the stage, screen, and concert halls. Soviet revisionist publications even boast that Soviet jazz is on par with Western standards, which is utterly shameless.

The Soviet revisionist renegade clique is so eager to peddle Western jazz music to satisfy the needs of the bourgeois privileged class. This new bourgeoisie, like all exploiting classes, plunders the fruits of the people's labor and lives a life of decadence and luxury. Whatever the Western bourgeoisie likes, they eagerly pursue. Brezhnev, Kosygin, and the like are ardent pursuers of the Western way of life. The American magazine *Time* once revealed that "Kosygin is one of the largest collectors of jazz music records in Russia."

Music, like other forms of art, is a tool of class struggle, used by different classes to serve different political purposes. During the period when Stalin led the Soviet Union, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) repeatedly criticized the formalist and decadent tendencies in the Soviet music world that imitated Western music, calling the noisy and frenzied Western music "murderers of music."

"Evil will surely bring disaster."

After the Soviet revisionist renegade clique usurped the party and the government, they committed all sorts of crimes, opening the door wide for this vulgar and decadent music. Their goal is to use this poison to numb the broad masses of the Soviet people, in order to maintain their counter-revolutionary revisionist rule. However, as our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "All retrograde actions result in the opposite of what the initiators intended. This is true throughout history, both in China and abroad, without exception." The broad masses of the Soviet people, who are rich in revolutionary traditions, can only see more clearly the counter-revolutionary faces of these renegades from the Soviet revisionist clique's evil deeds of peddling poison.

　　妖为鬼蜮必成灾
    西方爵士乐正在苏联大肆泛滥。这是苏修叛徒集团全面复辟资本主义的恶果之一，也是勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流所代表的苏联新资产阶级腐朽没落的一种表现。
    爵士音乐，是现代西方“文明”和“美国生活方式”的丑恶的标志。这种下流音乐在资本主义国家中也为广大人民所厌恶和摒弃，但是现在却在苏联大行其道，散发出令人作呕的腐臭。苏修叛徒集团不仅大量输入西方爵士音乐，而且在国内大肆宣扬和推广，让这种靡靡之音，占领乐坛、舞台、银幕。苏修报刊甚至洋洋得意地吹嘘，苏联的爵士乐不亚于西方的水平，真是无耻到了极点。
    苏修叛徒集团这样卖力地推销西方爵士乐，是为了满足资产阶级特权阶层的需要。他们这一伙新资产阶级，和一切剥削阶级一样，侵吞人民劳动果实，过着骄奢淫逸的腐朽生活。西方资产阶级所喜爱的东西，他们无不趋之若鹜。勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流，就是西方生活方式的狂热追求者。美国《时代》周刊就曾经透露，“柯西金是俄国国内最大的爵士音乐唱片收集者之一。”
    音乐也和其他各种艺术形式一样，是阶级斗争的工具，是被不同的阶级利用来为不同的政治服务的。在斯大林领导苏联的时期，联共（布）中央曾经多次批评过苏联音乐界中出现的摹仿西方音乐的形式主义和颓废主义倾向，把喧嚣、颠狂的西方音乐称为“音乐上的杀人犯”。
    “妖为鬼蜮必成灾。”
    苏修叛徒集团篡党篡政以后，倒行逆施，为这种恶俗不堪的音乐大开方便之门。他们的目的是要用这种毒品来麻醉苏联广大人民，以便维护他们的反革命修正主义统治。但是，正如我们的伟大领袖毛主席所指出的：“凡属倒退行为，结果都和主持者的原来的愿望相反。古今中外，没有例外。”富有革命传统的广大苏联人民从苏修集团这种贩毒害人的罪恶行径中，只能更加看清楚这些叛徒的反革命面目。
