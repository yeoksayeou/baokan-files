Over 1,300 college graduates in the Guangzhou region, full of revolutionary spirit, head to the countryside

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 20 — The 1967 college graduates in the Guangzhou region, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have followed the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao to resolutely take the path of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers. The first batch of over 1,300 graduates has already set off to the People's Liberation Army farms to become ordinary farmers.

	The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, has provided excellent tempering and testing for these graduates, laying a solid ideological foundation for them to take the path of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers. They have deeply understood Chairman Mao's teachings on how "intellectuals, if they do not integrate with the workers and peasants, will achieve nothing. The final dividing line between revolutionary and non-revolutionary or counter-revolutionary intellectuals is whether they are willing and able to integrate with the workers and peasants." When these graduates were about to embark on their journey, Chairman Mao's directive, "Universities should still be run, and I am mainly talking about universities of science and engineering. The system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, and proletarian politics should be in command. The path of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, which cultivates technical personnel from workers, should be followed. Students should be selected from workers and peasants with practical experience, study in schools for a few years, and then return to production practice," once again pointed the way forward for the graduates. Under the guidance of the revolutionary committees and the PLA propaganda teams for Mao Zedong Thought in various schools, the graduates held Mao Zedong Thought study classes, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's great directives, and combined them with their own experiences. They launched a revolutionary criticism, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to fiercely criticize the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev in his frenzied opposition to the integration of educated youth with workers, peasants, and soldiers. At the same time, the graduates also fiercely fought against the "private" character in their minds, further purging the corrupt and reactionary ideas of "those who work with their minds govern others" and "those who study well become officials" that have been ingrained in people's minds for thousands of years. Many graduates from various schools also invited workers and poor and lower-middle peasants to give reports and held bitter-sweet remembrance activities, greatly enhancing their political awareness. Through learning, many leaders of revolutionary mass organizations in various schools took the initiative to go to the most difficult places; among revolutionary students, there emerged the moving scene of competing to go to the most difficult and most needed places in the motherland.

	Before the first batch of graduates in the Guangzhou region set off, all the college graduates held meetings to pledge allegiance to Chairman Mao. Many graduates, full of revolutionary spirit, solemnly vowed before Chairman Mao's portrait, expressing their determination to follow the path of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers as indicated by our great leader Chairman Mao and to march forward bravely.

    广州地区一千三百多名大专院校毕业生
    满怀革命豪情奔赴农村广阔天地
    出发前狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫的谬论，狠斗了私字，大大提高了觉悟
    据新华社广州二十日电　经过文化大革命锻炼的广州地区一九六七年大专院校毕业生，遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，坚决走与工农兵相结合的道路。第一批毕业生一千三百多人已奔赴解放军农场当普通农民。
    伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，使这届大专院校毕业生经受了很好的锻炼和考验，为他们走上与工农兵相结合的道路打下了坚实的思想基础，对伟大领袖毛主席关于“知识分子如果不和工农民众相结合，则将一事无成。革命的或不革命的或反革命的知识分子的最后的分界，看其是否愿意并且实行和工农民众相结合”的亲切教导，有了深刻体会。当这届毕业生即将踏上征途时，伟大领袖毛主席发出的“大学还是要办的，我这里主要说的是理工科大学还要办，但学制要缩短，教育要革命，要无产阶级政治挂帅，走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路。要从有实践经验的工人农民中间选拔学生，到学校学几年以后，又回到生产实践中去”的英明指示，再一次为毕业生们指明了前进的方向。他们在各院校革委会和解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，通过举办毛泽东思想学习班，反复学习毛主席的伟大指示，并结合自己的切身体会，开展了革命大批判，以毛泽东思想为武器，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫疯狂反对知识青年与工农兵相结合的滔天罪行。同时，毕业生们还狠斗头脑中的“私”字，进一步肃清千百年来遗留在人们头脑里的“劳心者治人”、“学而优则仕”等腐朽反动的思想影响。不少院校的毕业生还邀请工人、贫下中农给他们作报告，开展忆苦思甜活动，大大提高了政治觉悟。通过学习，许多院校的革命群众组织负责人带头要求到最艰苦的地方去；在革命学生中，出现了争着到最艰苦地方去，到祖国最需要的地方去的动人场面。
    广州地区第一批毕业生出发以前，各大专院校毕业生都举行了向毛主席表忠心大会，许多毕业生满怀革命豪情，面向毛主席像庄严宣誓，表示坚决遵照伟大领袖毛主席指引的与工农兵相结合的道路奋勇前进。
