Chairman Mao's Workers, Hearts Redder Than the Furnace

In February of this year, the Revolutionary Committee of the First Workshop of Liaoning Steel Plant was born in the storm of class struggle!

The celebration meeting for the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee had just dispersed when an old worker and leader of the original revolutionary mass organization, Yan Risheng, with Chairman Mao's book in his arms, happily returned to his production post. He put on his work clothes, picked up his steel bar, and returned to the battle at the iron furnace where steel sparks fly.

The news that Comrade Yan was once again working as a furnace operator quickly spread throughout the factory. The workers unanimously praised him, saying: "Comrade Yan follows Chairman Mao's instructions, 'grasp revolution, promote production' with one heart, one loyalty, and one spirit of struggle. This is the true character of our working class!"

Chairman Mao personally ignited the flames of the Cultural Revolution. Yan Risheng, an ordinary steelworker, stood bravely on the frontline of class struggle as a member of the leading class. During the days when Khrushchev in China pushed the capitalist reactionary line, "encircled" the revolutionary factions, and implemented white terror, he followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "rebelling is justified" and led the way in rebelling against the factory's capitalist roaders. When the capitalist roaders and a handful of class enemies incited the masses to fight each other and attempted to sabotage production, he and the broad revolutionary masses guarded the factory day and night, together grasping the revolution and vigorously promoting production. When the entire factory achieved revolutionary great unity, he again ran to the oxygen station, canteen, and various workshops and teams, actively propagating and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, promoting the revolutionary great unity of the entire factory. At the beginning of this year, when the factory Revolutionary Committee was being established, the workers of the First Workshop discussed: "Comrade Yan closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment during the Cultural Revolution, resolutely executed Chairman Mao's instructions. Where it was difficult, he went; where it was dangerous, he appeared. This time, we must definitely elect Comrade Yan into the Revolutionary Committee."

However, Comrade Yan did not think about these things at all. What he thought about was how to closely follow Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and establish the factory Revolutionary Committee as soon as possible. A few days before the election, some people in the revolutionary mass organization he was in heard that various mass organizations would elect an equal number of representatives to participate in the Revolutionary Committee, and they couldn't understand it. Some people came to Comrade Yan to express their opinions: Our organization has always been correct in its general direction, but we have more than two hundred people and only one representative, while some "fighting teams" have only six people and also have one representative, which is unreasonable. The revolutionary three-in-one combination work in the First Workshop temporarily hit a snag.

Seeing this situation, Comrade Yan was very anxious. At this time, Chairman Mao's teaching of "Revolutionary Committees are good" echoed in his ears. He thought, Chairman Mao has waved to us, and we, the working class, must definitely forge ahead on the path indicated by Chairman Mao. Comrade Yan stood on the standpoint of proletarian party spirit and voluntarily proposed not to elect himself, and instead proposed to elect the old worker Comrade Zhang. He believed that Comrade Zhang was an old worker who had suffered immense exploitation and oppression in the old society, had boundless love for Chairman Mao, and was more familiar with the factory's situation than himself. Electing Comrade Zhang to the Revolutionary Committee would be more appropriate. At that time, some people couldn't understand it, so Comrade Yan patiently did detailed ideological and political work, and together with everyone, studied Chairman Mao's teachings word by word: "The proletariat not only wants to liberate itself but also wants to liberate all mankind. If it cannot liberate all mankind, the proletariat cannot ultimately liberate itself." Comrade Yan also spoke earnestly to his comrades: "We workers follow Chairman Mao in making revolution, not for the sake of gaining a position or building a personal faction, but for the revolution, to defend the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and to defend the leadership of the working class. We workers are most disgusted with and oppose fighting for seats and cores. We will never do such things in our lifetime!" The workers all said that Comrade Yan was right, speaking the true words of the working class. In this way, the more than two hundred revolutionary masses in the revolutionary mass organization he was in unanimously elected the leader of the opposing organization, Comrade Zhang, to participate in the "three-in-one combination" Revolutionary Committee. The Revolutionary Committee of the First Workshop was quickly established.

After the Revolutionary Committee was established, Comrade Yan did not think that his responsibility had been reduced, but rather that the burden on his shoulders had become heavier. He thought: We, the working class, are the leading class. Even if we are not members of the Revolutionary Committee, we should still play the leading role of the working class and set a good example. Therefore, he often helped the members of the Revolutionary Committee come up with ideas and solutions. Comrade Zhang was active and hardworking in the Revolutionary Committee, gaining the praise of his comrades. However, Comrade Zhang was a welder, and was not familiar with smelting, so he sometimes found it difficult to handle problems. Comrade Yan knew this, so he took the initiative to talk to Comrade Zhang. The two of them studied Chairman Mao's teachings together, and together recalled the various crimes of the factory's capitalist roaders in persecuting workers. The more they talked, the closer they became. Comrade Yan said: "The working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought should lead everything and can lead everything. You should open your arms and dare to do it! We workers have a heart that is loyal to Chairman Mao, and there are no insurmountable difficulties." Comrade Zhang's heart was warm, and his spirit was even stronger. The workshop's revolution and production were better month by month.

"When the flowers bloom in the mountains, she smiles among them."

Every time the molten iron is poured, Comrade Yan always holds the steel bar and works at the forefront. He looks at the flowing molten iron, his face full of smiles, and the flying steel sparks make his smiling face even redder.

"The working class has the greatest foresight, is selfless, and is the most thorough in revolution." Comrade Yan is an ordinary member of the countless workers nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought.

### 毛主席的工人，心比炉火红

    毛主席的工人，心比炉火红
    今年二月，辽宁钢厂一工段革命委员会在阶级斗争的暴风雨中光荣诞生了！
    欢庆革命委员会成立的大会刚散，原革命群众组织的一个负责人、老工人严日升怀里揣着毛主席的书，乐呵呵地回到了生产岗位。他穿上工作服，拿起钢钎，重新战斗在钢花飞溅的铁炉旁。
    严师傅又当炉前工这件事，立刻传遍全厂。工人们齐声赞誉地说：“老严听毛主席的话，‘抓革命，促生产’是一个心眼，一片忠心，一股拚劲，这就是咱们工人阶级的本色！”
    毛主席亲自点燃了无产阶级文化大革命的烈火，严日升这位普普通通的炼钢工人，以领导阶级中的一个成员的姿态，勇敢地站在阶级斗争的第一线。在中国赫鲁晓夫推行资产阶级反动路线，“围剿”革命派，实行白色恐怖的日子里，他遵照毛主席“对反动派造反有理”的教导，带头起来造了厂内走资派的反；在走资派和一小撮阶级敌人挑动群众斗群众、妄图破坏生产时，他和广大革命群众日夜守在厂里，一起狠抓革命，猛促生产；在全厂实现革命大联合时，他又奔走于制氧站、食堂和各车间班组，积极宣传和落实毛主席的最新指示，促进了全厂的革命大联合。今年年初，酝酿成立厂革命委员会的时候，一工段的工人们纷纷议论：“严师傅在文化大革命中紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚决执行毛主席的指示，那里艰苦他到那里，那里危险他出现在那里，这回一定把老严选进革命委员会中。”
    可是，严师傅却丝毫没有想到这些。他心里想的是怎样才能紧跟毛主席的革命路线，把厂革命委员会及早建立起来。临选举的前几天，他所在的革命群众组织中的一些人，听说各派群众组织选出对等人数的代表参加革命委员会，就想不通。有的人跑来找严师傅提意见：咱们这个组织大方向一贯正确，二百多人才选一名代表，有的“战斗队”只有六个人，也选一名代表，不合理。一工段革命三结合的工作暂时顶了牛。
  严师傅看到这种情景，心里非常着急。这时，毛主席“革命委员会好”的教导响在他耳边，他想，毛主席向我们挥手了，咱们工人阶级就一定要按照毛主席他老人家指引的道路往前闯。严师傅站在无产阶级党性立场上，主动提议不要选自己，并且提议选老工人张师傅。他认为，张师傅是在旧社会受尽剥削、压榨的老工人，对毛主席无限热爱，对工厂的情况也比自己熟悉，选张师傅进入革命委员会比自己更合适。当时，有的人想不通，严师傅就耐心地做细致的思想政治工作，和大家一起逐字逐句地学习毛主席的教导：“无产阶级不但要解放自己，而且要解放全人类。如果不能解放全人类，无产阶级自己就不能最后地得到解放。”严师傅还语重心长地和同志们说：“我们工人阶级跟着毛主席闹革命，并不是为了弄上一官半职，搞个人的小山头，而是为了革命，为了保卫以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，为了保卫工人阶级的领导权。争席位、争核心的事咱们工人阶级最讨厌，最反对，我们一辈子也不能干！”工人们听了都说严师傅说得对，是工人阶级的心里话。就这样，他所在的这个革命群众组织的二百多名革命群众，一致推选对方组织的负责人张师傅参加“三结合”的革命委员会。一工段的革命委员会很快建立起来了。
    革命委员会成立以后，严师傅并不认为自己的责任减轻了，而是觉得肩上的担子更重了。他想：我们工人阶级是领导阶级，不当革委会的委员一样要起到工人阶级的领导作用，要作出好样子。因此，他经常帮助革命委员会的委员出主意、想办法。张师傅在革命委员会工作积极、肯干，获得同志们的好评。但是张师傅是水电焊工，对冶炼这一套不熟悉，在处理问题中有时觉得困难。严师傅知道后，就主动找张师傅谈心。两人一起学习毛主席的教导，一起回忆厂内走资派迫害工人的种种罪行，两人越说越亲热。严师傅说：“毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级应该领导一切，也能够领导一切，你就放开手脚大胆干吧！我们工人阶级有一颗忠于毛主席的红心，没有不可克服的困难。”张师傅听了心里热呼呼的，劲头更足了，工段上革命和生产一月比一月好。
      “待到山花烂漫时，她在丛中笑。”
    每当铁水出炉的时刻，严师傅总是手持钢钎干在最前面，他望着奔流的铁水，满脸挂笑，飞溅的钢花把他的笑脸映得更加通红通红。
      “工人阶级最有远见，大公无私，最富于革命的彻底性。”严师傅是毛泽东思想哺育出来的千千万万工人中的普通一员。
