Zimbabwe guerrillas have continued to strike at colonial forces, attacking a colonial military airfield and a military club, killing and injuring many enemy soldiers.

	New China News Agency, August 1st: Salisbury news: After inflicting heavy casualties on a battalion of Smith's colonial forces, which had received support from South African colonial forces, in the Zambezi Valley on July 17th, Zimbabwe guerrilla fighters launched attacks on Smith's colonial military airfield and military club over the two days of July 20th and 21st, once again delivering a heavy blow to the enemy.

	According to reports, on July 20th, Zimbabwe guerrillas attacked Kariba Airport in Southern Rhodesia, killing nine colonial soldiers and injuring several others.

	On July 21st, the colonial military club near Kariba also came under attack from the guerrillas, resulting in the deaths of six colonial soldiers.

	According to reports, after suffering consecutive attacks from Zimbabwe guerrillas, the Southern Rhodesian colonial forces, which had received support from South African colonial forces, saw Smith hurriedly rush to South Africa on July 26th to hold secret talks with South African "Prime Minister" Vorster, plotting further suppression of the Zimbabwe guerrillas.

	The Zimbabwe guerrillas are growing stronger in combat. The British "Sunday Telegraph" mentioned in discussing the "unprecedentedly fierce battles" between Smith's colonial forces and South African colonial forces with the Zimbabwe guerrillas over the past two weeks that the guerrillas are "the best trained," and that the guerrillas have not only increased in number but also greatly improved in "quality."

	This British newspaper also worriedly said: The guerrillas' strikes against the colonial forces have cost Southern Rhodesia "a great deal" and have affected the already tense economy.

　　津巴布韦游击队连续打击殖民军
　　袭击殖民军机场和军人俱乐部毙伤敌人多名
    新华社一日讯　索尔兹伯里消息：津巴布韦游击战士继七月十七日在赞比西河谷地区重创了一连受到南非殖民军支援的史密斯殖民军之后，七月二十日和二十一日两天，又连续袭击了史密斯殖民军机场和殖民军军人俱乐部，再一次给敌人以沉重的打击。
    据报道，七月二十日，津巴布韦游击队向南罗得西亚的卡里巴机场进行了袭击，打死了九名殖民军，另有好几名殖民军被打伤。
    七月二十一日，卡里巴附近的殖民军军人俱乐部，也受到游击队的袭击，有六名殖民军被打死。
    据报道，受到南非殖民军支援的南罗得西亚殖民军在遭到津巴布韦游击队的连续打击之后，史密斯于七月二十六日急忙跑到南非，同南非“总理”沃斯特进行密谈，策划进一步镇压津巴布韦游击队。
    津巴布韦游击队越战越强。英国的《星期日电讯报》在谈到史密斯殖民军和南非殖民军在近两周来和津巴布韦游击队进行“空前艰苦的交战”时惊呼游击队是经过“最好的训练”的，游击队不仅在数量上，在“质量上也大大改观”。
    这家英国报刊还忧心忡忡地说：游击队对殖民军的打击使南罗得西亚“付出很大的代价，并对已经紧张的经济产生影响。”
