Under the battle command of the proletarian headquarters, the revolutionary workers of the metallurgical industry fully exert the leading role of the working class.

New China News Agency, August 16th: The great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully exert the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and all work. The working class should also continuously improve its political consciousness in the struggle." After Chairman Mao's extremely important latest instructions were issued, he also received representatives of the working class in the capital and soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, greatly inspiring the revolutionary enthusiasm of the working class and hundreds of millions of military and civilian personnel across the country. Revolutionary workers from the metallurgical industry across the country, upon hearing this great news, were all overjoyed and excited, staying up all night. They seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and held discussions. They pointed out that at this critical moment of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the issuance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions is of great significance for us to complete the various tasks at hand. We must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, further arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, and under the command of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, unify our thinking, steps, and actions. We must fully exert the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and all work, and swear to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

Only by following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment can the working class fully exert its leading role.

The great leader Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "The Chinese proletariat began to step onto the stage of revolution under the leadership of its revolutionary party, the Communist Party of China, and became the most conscious class in Chinese society." Many worker representatives in the discussions recalled with deep proletarian feelings the process of their growth under the cultivation and education of the great leader Chairman Mao and the Party. They said, the great teacher of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, is the closest to us workers, and the workers are the closest to Chairman Mao. In the past, under Chairman Mao's leadership, we overthrew the three big mountains of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, achieved national liberation, and successfully carried out socialist revolution and socialist construction. Today, we must, under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, continue to exert the leading role of the working class, and complete the historical mission entrusted to us by Chairman Mao.

Shanghai steel workers shared their experiences in following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment at the meeting. They said, the Shanghai working class, under the command of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, has been continuously launching fierce attacks on the class enemy without stopping, always leading the situation of the Cultural Revolution, and achieving one victory after another. They said, revolutionary practice has made us deeply realize that following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment is victory, and the closer we follow Chairman Mao, the greater our victories will be.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Benxi Steel Company, which achieved revolutionary and production victories by following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, said in the discussion that the situation in Benxi Steel Company is now very good, with more than twenty units all achieving revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combinations. The spiritual outlook of the broad revolutionary cadres has undergone tremendous changes, and many new technologies and records with world advanced levels have been created in production, with the production situation getting better and better. All of this is the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, the result of seriously implementing Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. They said with deep feelings, we workers have the great leader Chairman Mao's leadership, we have Mao Zedong Thought, and we can create any miracle in the world. We workers can only be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, in order to fully exert our leading role and, together with the people of the whole country, advance from victory to victory.

The representatives also criticized the reactionary bourgeois "multi-center theory" in the discussion. They pointed out that the class enemy uses the "multi-center theory" to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which is a new trend in class struggle. Therefore, we must thoroughly criticize the reactionary "multi-center theory" and throw the right-wing splitist "multi-center is no center theory" into the garbage dump! Only in this way can we, under the command of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, unify our thinking, steps, and actions, fully implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, while transforming the objective world, continuously transform the subjective world.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The struggle of the proletariat and revolutionary people to transform the world includes the task of achieving the following: transforming the objective world, and also transforming one's own subjective world—transforming one's cognitive ability, transforming the relationship between the subjective world and the objective world." Revolutionary workers from the metallurgical industry discussed Mao's teachings. They said, Chairman Mao's latest instructions again teach us: "The working class should also continuously improve its political consciousness in the struggle." This is exactly what we have in mind. We workers must arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought and continuously transform our worldview in order to fully exert the leading role of the working class.

Old worker Zhang Jinhai from Tianjin Rolling Mill No. 3 shared his experiences in the discussion. He said, in the old society, I suffered a lot of oppression and exploitation. It was Chairman Mao who led us to overthrow the three big mountains and become the masters of the state. From the day I entered Rolling Mill No. 3, I made a vow to work hard to improve production and repay Chairman Mao's kindness. Over the years, I have always worked diligently. However, due to not studying and applying Chairman Mao's works well, my consciousness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines was not high, which led to being deceived by a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party in the early days of the Cultural Revolution. It was Chairman Mao who personally presided over the formulation of the "Sixteen Points" that helped me recognize my mistakes and return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Since then, I have read Chairman Mao's books every day, especially actively learning and applying the "Old Three Articles," transforming my worldview. Last year, at the most intense moment of the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads, I followed Chairman Mao's instruction to "grasp revolution and promote production," firmly guarding my production post, preventing the sabotage of the class enemy, and comrades gave me high honors. Zhang Jinhai said, we workers can only actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, arm ourselves with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, continuously improve our consciousness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, smash the "self" and establish the "public," thoroughly eliminate the influence of bourgeois ideology, and not disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations for us workers, fully exerting our leading role in the Cultural Revolution and all work.

The various mass organizations of the Capital Steel Company, which had not achieved revolutionary great unity for a long time, reached an agreement to establish a workers' congress preparatory committee on the evening of the 15th under the illumination of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, uniting on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought. The worker representatives of the various mass organizations of Capital Steel said in the discussion, the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions are a great concern and ardent expectation for the working class. Our responsibility is very heavy. We must continuously improve our political consciousness in the struggle to follow Chairman Mao and exert the leading role of the working class.

The representatives unanimously agreed in the discussion that the working class must fully exert its leading role, and must also be good at uniting all forces that can be united, firmly grasp the revolution, and vigorously promote production, carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

The steel workers of Anshan and Shanghai said, at this critical moment of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we workers bear a heavy and glorious task. We must unite all forces that can be united, fiercely strike at a handful of class enemies, launch a new wave of grasping the revolution and promoting production, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The worker representatives of Tianjin Steel Plant said, Chairman Mao teaches us: "The proletariat not only wants to liberate itself, but also wants to liberate all of humanity. If the proletariat cannot liberate all of humanity, the proletariat itself cannot ultimately be liberated." We workers have the responsibility to help the broad revolutionary masses implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. For this, the working class of Tianjin is learning from the working class of the capital and has already formed Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, enthusiastically propagating and firmly defending Mao Zedong Thought. We must unite with the broad revolutionary masses, actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, and excellently complete the glorious tasks entrusted to us by Chairman Mao.

    在无产阶级司令部战斗号令下
    充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用
    ——冶金工业战线革命工人代表座谈毛主席最新指示
    新华社十六日讯　伟大领袖毛主席最近指出：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”毛主席这一极为重要的最新指示发表后，又接见了首都工人阶级的代表和人民解放军指战员，极大地鼓舞了全国工人阶级和亿万军民的革命热情。来自全国各地冶金工业战线的革命工人代表，听到这一特大喜讯，无不欢欣鼓舞，激动得彻夜不眠。他们认真地学习了毛主席的最新指示，并进行座谈讨论。他们指出，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的关键时刻，毛主席最新指示的发表，对于我们完成面临的各项任务有重大的意义，我们一定要坚定不移地落实毛主席的最新指示，进一步用毛泽东思想武装自己，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的号令下，统一认识，统一步伐，统一行动，充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用，誓将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    只有紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，工人阶级才能充分发挥领导作用
    伟大领袖毛主席早就指出：“中国无产阶级开始走上革命的舞台，就在本阶级的革命政党——中国共产党领导之下，成为中国社会里比较最有觉悟的阶级。”许多工人代表在座谈讨论中，怀着无比深厚的无产阶级感情，追述了自己在伟大领袖毛主席和党的培养教育下战斗成长的过程。他们说，无产阶级的伟大导师毛主席和我们工人阶级最亲，工人阶级跟毛主席最紧。过去我们在毛主席的领导下，推翻了帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义三座大山，取得了全国解放，胜利地进行着社会主义革命和社会主义建设。今天，我们必须在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的领导下，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，继续发挥工人阶级的领导作用，完成毛主席交给我们的历史使命。
    上海钢铁工人在座谈会上谈了他们紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署的体会。他们说，我们上海工人阶级紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的号令下，不停顿地向阶级敌人发起猛烈进攻，一直左右着文化大革命的形势，取得了一个又一个的胜利。他们说，革命的实践使我们深深体会到：紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署就是胜利，跟毛主席越紧，我们取得的胜利就越大。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，取得革命和生产双胜利的本溪钢铁公司的工人代表，在座谈中说，现在本溪钢铁公司形势一片大好，二十多个单位全部实现了革命的大联合和革命的三结合。广大革命职工的精神面貌发生了巨大变化，在生产中创造了许多具有世界先进水平的新技术和新纪录，生产形势越来越好。所有这一切，都是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是认真落实毛主席一系列最新指示的结果。他们深有体会地说，我们工人阶级有了伟大领袖毛主席的领导，有了毛泽东思想，任何人间奇迹都能创造出来。我们工人阶级只有无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，才能充分发挥自己的领导作用，和全国人民一起从胜利走向胜利。
    代表们在座谈中还批判了反动的资产阶级的“多中心论”。他们指出，阶级敌人利用“多中心论”破坏无产阶级文化大革命，这是当前阶级斗争的新动向。所以我们必须彻底批判反动的“多中心论”，把右倾分裂主义的“多中心即无中心论”抛到垃圾堆里去！只有这样，才能在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的号令下，统一认识，统一步伐，统一行动，全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
      活学活用毛泽东思想，在改造客观世界的同时
    不断改造主观世界
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“无产阶级和革命人民改造世界的斗争，包括实现下述的任务：改造客观世界，也改造自己的主观世界——改造自己的认识能力，改造主观世界同客观世界的关系。”冶金工业战线革命工人代表在座谈中，重温了毛主席的这一教导。他们说，毛主席在最新指示中再一次教导我们：“工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”正是说到了我们的心坎上。我们工人阶级必须用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，不断改造世界观，才能充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用。
    天津轧钢三厂老工人张金海在座谈中谈了自己的体会。他说，在旧社会，我受尽了压迫和剥削，是毛主席领导我们推翻了三座大山，当了国家的主人。我从进入轧钢三厂第一天起，就立下心愿，一定要努力搞好生产，报答毛主席的恩情。十几年来，工作一直勤勤恳恳。但是由于没有学好用好毛主席著作，阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟不高，以致在文化大革命初期，受了党内一小撮走资派的蒙蔽。是毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”，帮助我认识了错误，回到了毛主席的革命路线上来。从此以后，我天天读毛主席的书，特别是活学活用“老三篇”，改造自己的世界观。去年在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争最激烈的时刻，我遵照毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的教导，坚守生产岗位，防止了阶级敌人的破坏，同志们给了我很高的荣誉。张金海说，我们工人只有活学活用毛主席著作，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装自己，不断提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，彻底清除资产阶级思想的影响，才能不辜负毛主席对我们工人阶级的期望，在文化大革命中和一切工作中充分发挥领导作用。
    长期没有实现革命大联合的首都钢铁公司各群众组织，在毛主席最新指示的光辉照耀下，十五日晚达成成立工代会筹委会的协议，在毛泽东思想的原则基础上联合了起来。首钢各群众组织的工人代表在座谈中说，伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示，是对工人阶级的巨大的关怀，殷切的期望。我们的责任十分重大，只有不断地在斗争中提高自己的政治觉悟，才能做到紧跟毛主席，发挥工人阶级的领导作用。
    团结一切可以团结的力量，掀起抓革命、促生产新高潮
    代表们在座谈中一致认为，工人阶级要充分发挥领导作用，还必须善于团结一切可以团结的力量，狠抓革命，猛促生产，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    鞍山和上海的钢铁工人代表说，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的关键时刻，我们工人阶级肩负着重大而光荣的任务。我们必须团结一切可以团结的力量，狠狠打击一小撮阶级敌人，掀起抓革命，促生产的新高潮，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    天津钢厂工人代表说，毛主席教导我们：“无产阶级不但要解放自己，而且要解放全人类。如果不能解放全人类，无产阶级自己就不能最后地得到解放。”我们工人阶级有责任帮助广大革命群众落实毛主席的一系列最新指示。为此，我们天津工人阶级，正在向首都工人阶级学习，已经组成了毛泽东思想宣传队，热情宣传、坚决捍卫毛泽东思想。我们一定要和广大革命群众团结在一起，活学活用毛泽东思想，坚决落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，出色地完成毛主席交给我们的光荣任务。
