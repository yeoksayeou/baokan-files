In July, the brave Palestinian guerrillas launched extensive attacks and bravely fought against the enemy in the vast battlefield of the areas occupied by Israel. They carried out 75 attacks against Israeli occupying forces, military installations, and transportation routes, killing 600 enemy soldiers and inflicting heavy losses on the enemy.

Despite the recent decision by U.S. imperialism to provide Israel with missile weapons to intimidate the Palestinian people and other Arab nations, and despite the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Arthur Goldberg, visiting Israel and blatantly inspecting Israeli military outposts on the occupied Syrian territory of the Golan Heights to boost Israeli morale, the Palestinian guerrillas were very active in this area in July. The "Storm" commando units of "Fatah" (Palestine Liberation Movement) and guerrillas from other Palestinian nationalist organizations concentrated their attacks on more than ten Israeli military camps and many military outposts in the regions of the Sea of Galilee, the Negev Desert, the Beisan Valley, and the Dead Sea. They bravely annihilated the enemy, causing many military camps to suffer complete annihilation. On July 26, a "Storm" commando unit fought bravely and tenaciously against Israeli invading forces near Jericho. After running out of ammunition, they engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy. In this battle, they killed an Israeli colonel and a captain, causing the enemy to be greatly terrified and shaken. The Palestinian guerrillas often fought continuously throughout the day or night, launching multiple attacks against the enemy. Their activities extended to the areas of Eilat and Haifa, causing the enemy to be greatly alarmed.

According to recent battle reports from "Fatah" and other Palestinian nationalist organizations, from July 22 to 31, the Palestinian guerrillas launched 22 attacks against Israeli occupying forces, killing and wounding more than 130 Israeli soldiers.

On the night of July 22, several units of the "Storm" commando led by "Fatah" launched five attacks against the enemy. They blew up the oil pipeline between Eilat and Haifa in the Frej region with explosives, destroying a section of it; they shelled an Israeli camp south of Shoval and the Beit Haikka outpost in the Negev Desert; they attacked Israeli ambushes in Muzhaim in the Beisan Valley; they ambushed Israeli patrols in the Araba Valley. In these battles, they killed and wounded 41 Israeli invaders, destroyed one tank, seven other military vehicles, and one heavy artillery piece.

On the night of July 23, the "Storm" commando planted landmines on the road to Amara south of Hishik, near an Israeli factory in the Negev, destroying an Israeli half-track vehicle. They then attacked the Israeli guards and their tents at the factory, and blew up the factory's machinery, causing heavy losses to the enemy.

On the night of July 25, a "Storm" commando unit planted landmines and destroyed an Israeli garage and five vehicles in the Romema industrial zone of Jerusalem.

On the night of July 26, a "Storm" commando unit planted landmines on a public road near the Israeli settlement of Kenta, destroying two enemy patrol cars and killing all the people inside. They then engaged in a battle with Israeli reinforcements, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. On the same night, other Palestinian guerrillas launched six attacks on the enemy in the Golan Heights: they planted landmines on the roads of Kfar Haruv and Alaman, destroying two Israeli vehicles and killing all the people inside; they blew up an Israeli camp east of Uleika, killing all the Israeli soldiers inside; on their way back, they annihilated an Israeli ambush and returned safely.

On the night of July 28, the "Storm" commando shelled the Israeli military outpost in Mendasa with mortars, causing heavy losses to the enemy. They attacked the Israeli outpost in Muzhaim with rockets and other weapons, and at the same time, they shelled Israeli reinforcements with mortars, blocking the enemy and annihilating an Israeli ambush, destroying a cannon and several military vehicles.

On the night of July 30, the Palestinian commando unit planted landmines and destroyed an Israeli truck in Gaza City.

On the night of July 31, the "Storm" commando shelled an Israeli camp near King Hussein Bridge on the west bank of the Jordan River with rockets, completely destroying it, and also destroying an ammunition depot and an observation post, killing and wounding 12 Israeli invaders.

    二十二日晚，“法塔赫”领导的“暴风”突击队的几支队伍向敌人发动了五次进攻。他们用炸药爆破了弗雷杰地区埃拉特和海法之间的油管，炸毁了其中一段；炮击了舒维尔军营以南的以色列的一个营地和内格夫沙漠的贝特哈基卡据点；袭击了贝桑河谷穆兹哈伊姆的以色列伏兵；在阿拉巴河谷伏击了以色列巡逻兵，他们在以上战斗中共打死打伤以色列侵略军四十一人，击毁坦克一辆，其它军车七辆，重炮一门。
    二十三日晚，“暴风”突击队在通往内格夫的阿迈拉以南希谢赫的一家以色列工厂的路上埋设地雷炸毁了以色列援军的一辆半履带式车辆，同时袭击了驻在这家工厂的以色列卫兵和他们的营帐，接着炸了这家工厂的机器，使敌人遭到重大损失。
    二十五日晚，一支“暴风”突击队用地雷炸毁了耶路撒冷罗米马工业区的一个以色列车库和五辆车。
    二十六日晚，一支“暴风”突击队在以色列境内肯塔定居点附近的公路上埋设地雷，炸毁了敌人的两辆巡逻车，炸死炸伤车上所有的人，并同以色列援军交战，使敌人遭到沉重损失。同天晚上，其他的巴勒斯坦游击队在戈兰高地向敌人发动了六次袭击：他们在克法哈里卜和阿拉曼的公路上用地雷炸毁了两辆以色列车辆，炸死车上所有的人；炸毁了乌莱卡以东的一座以色列营房，把营房内的以色列军全部打死；在归途上，他们又歼灭一支以色列伏兵，安全返回。
