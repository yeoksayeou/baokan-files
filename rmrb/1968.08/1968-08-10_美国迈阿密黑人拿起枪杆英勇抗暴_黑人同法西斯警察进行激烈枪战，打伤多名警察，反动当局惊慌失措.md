Black residents of Miami, Florida, took up arms on August 8th, engaging in a fierce gun battle with fascist police, injuring multiple officers, and striking a heavy blow against the reactionary rule of U.S. monopoly capital. The reactionary authorities were thrown into panic.

On the evening of August 7th, a large gathering of Black residents in Miami's Black community held a meeting to protest the recent Republican National Convention held in Miami. When the reactionary ruling class sent in a large number of police to suppress the gathering, the Black residents bravely fought back, using stones and Molotov cocktails in an all-night battle against the fascist police.

On the morning of August 8th, the U.S. reactionary ruling class sent in more police reinforcements to the Black community, conducting mass arrests. The Black residents bravely charged forward, surrounding the police, rescuing their captured brethren, and pelting the police with a barrage of stones, destroying many police cars and forcing the fascist police to retreat in disarray from the Black community. In the afternoon, the fascist police released tear gas over a wide area. The Black residents, undaunted, fought bravely through the gas and smoke against the police. Some armed Black residents engaged in fierce gun battles with the police, injuring multiple officers and forcing the remaining police to cower behind their cars, repeatedly calling for reinforcements. Black snipers also continued to shoot at the helicopters directing the suppression.

Miami is a coastal city in the southern United States. Previous large-scale Black uprisings had not affected this area. Recently, one of the two major U.S. monopoly capitalist parties, the Republican Party, chose this city, which they considered a safe haven, to hold their convention, meticulously planning their deceptive two-party election schemes. However, the Black residents of Miami launched a massive uprising, striking a heavy blow to these monopolists and reactionary politicians attending the convention, leaving them in a state of panic. Florida Governor Kirk hastily left the convention to direct the suppression of the Black residents. The Miami police authorities also cried out that the Black uprising had reached a "dangerous level." That evening, the reactionary ruling authorities hastily declared an indefinite curfew in Miami and sent in an additional 500 mounted police and 600 National Guard to intensify the brutal suppression of the Black residents. However, the Black residents continued their struggle, with gunshots echoing throughout the city.

At the same time as the Black residents of Miami rose up, armed Black residents in the suburbs of Detroit, Inkster, had been using a "hit-and-run" tactic for four consecutive nights, striking fear into the hearts of the fascist police, leaving them in disarray. They had already killed and injured three police officers.

Despite the obstruction and sabotage by the reactionary police, Black students in South Carolina held a protest march, denouncing the U.S. reactionaries' massacre of Black youth.

　　美国迈阿密黑人拿起枪杆英勇抗暴
　　黑人同法西斯警察进行激烈枪战，打伤多名警察，反动当局惊慌失措
    新华社九日讯　华盛顿消息：美国佛罗里达州迈阿密市的黑人群众，八日拿起枪杆，在一场激烈的枪战中把法西斯警察打得狼狈不堪，把反动的社会秩序砸得稀烂，再一次沉重地打击了美国垄断资本的反动统治。
    迈阿密黑人区的广大黑人群众七日晚举行群众大会，抗议最近在迈阿密举行的共和党全国代表大会。当反动统治集团出动大批警察镇压时，黑人群众奋起迎战，用石块和燃烧瓶同法西斯警察进行了通宵的激战。
    八日上午，美国反动统治集团又派出大批增援警察开进黑人区，进行疯狂的逮捕。黑人们英勇地冲上去包围了警察，解救被捕的兄弟，并用一阵阵暴雨般的石块，砸毁了许多警车，把法西斯警察打得狼狈不堪地逃出了黑人区。下午，法西斯警察竟然在大片地区施放催泪瓦斯，黑人群众毫不畏惧，冒着瓦斯的浓烟和警察英勇搏斗，一些带枪的黑人和警察进行激烈的枪战，打伤了多名警察，并使其余的警察龟缩在警车背后，不断嚎叫要求增援。黑人狙击手还不断开枪射击飞来指挥镇压的直升飞机。
    迈阿密市是美国南部的海滨城市。美国历次较大规模的黑人抗暴斗争一直没有波及这里。最近，美国两大垄断资产阶级政党之一的共和党，就选定了这个他们自认为相当保险的安乐窝迈阿密召开代表大会，紧锣密鼓地策划着欺骗美国人民的两党竞选的鬼把戏。但是，迈阿密市的黑人群众却掀起了一场声势浩大的抗暴斗争，给了这些前来参加会议的垄断资本家和反动政客当头一棒，弄得他们六神不安，惊慌失措。正在参加代表大会的佛罗里达州州长柯克慌忙离开会场，赶去指挥对黑人的镇压；迈阿密的警察当局也惊呼，黑人抗暴斗争已达到了“危险的程度”。当晚，反动统治当局急忙宣布在迈阿密无限期戒严，并增派五百名骑警和六百名国民警卫队对黑人加紧进行残酷的镇压。但是黑人群众仍然继续坚持斗争，市内到处不断有枪声传出。
    在迈阿密黑人奋起抗暴的同时，底特律市郊区印克斯特带枪的黑人到八日为止，已经一连四夜用“打了就跑”的战术，把法西斯警察打得丧魂失魄，狼狈周章，他们已经打死打伤三名警察。（附图片）
　　不顾反动警察的阻挠与破坏，美国南卡罗来纳州的黑人学生举行示威游行，抗议美国反动派屠杀黑人青年。
