The revolutionary workers of Benxi Iron and Steel Company, with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army's leftist units, have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, earnestly implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and vigorously grasped class struggle. They have carried out thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism, achieving one great victory after another in the great struggle to seize the revolution and promote production.

Currently, this company and its 22 affiliated factories and mines have all established revolutionary committees. On the basis of further consolidating and developing revolutionary unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, production has also seen significant development. Since the beginning of this year, the company's total industrial output value has risen steadily. The production of major products such as pig iron, steel, steel materials, and concentrate powder, as well as the total amount of ore mining, have all increased significantly. The average daily production of sulfuric acid has reached a historical high. Major technological innovations and scientific research projects that have been successfully tested continue to emerge, some of which have reached and surpassed international advanced levels.

Chairman Mao personally presided over the formulation of the "Sixteen Points," which states: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a powerful driving force for the development of social productive forces in our country." The inspiring great situation of revolution and production in Benxi Iron and Steel Company fully illustrates this great truth. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    目前，这个公司及所属二十二个厂矿全部成立了革命委员会。在革命大联合和革命三结合日益巩固和发展的基础上，生产也有了很大发展。今年以来，全公司的工业生产总值直线上升，生铁、钢、钢材、选矿粉等主要产品的产量以及矿石采剥总量，都有大幅度提高。硫酸的平均日产量创造了历史最高纪录。试验成功的重大技术革新和科学研究项目接连不断地出现，其中有些达到和超过了国际先进水平。
    毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”指出：“无产阶级文化大革命是使我国社会生产力发展的一个强大的推动力。”本溪钢铁公司革命、生产出现的鼓舞人心的大好形势，充分说明了这个伟大的真理。（据新华社讯）
