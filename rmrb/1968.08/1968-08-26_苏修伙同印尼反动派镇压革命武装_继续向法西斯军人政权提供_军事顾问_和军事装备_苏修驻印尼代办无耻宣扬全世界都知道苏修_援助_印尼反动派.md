The Soviet revisionist clique is continuing to provide "military advisors" and military equipment to the fascist military regime in Indonesia, collaborating with this fascist regime to suppress the Indonesian people's armed revolutionary struggle, blatantly exposing the Soviet revisionist clique's anti-communist, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary ugly face.

According to reports from Western news agencies, the Soviet revisionist clique's chargé d'affaires in Indonesia made a public confession on the 24th in Jakarta about the counter-revolutionary collusion between the Soviet Union and the Indonesian fascist regime. He shamelessly boasted to a group of right-wing students in Jakarta, "Let me remind you, the Soviet Union is aiding Indonesia, and the whole world knows this." Indeed, the whole world knows that the Soviet revisionists are aiding the Indonesian reactionaries, suppressing the Indonesian people.

According to reports from Western news agencies, the naval commander of the Suharto-Nasution fascist regime, Muryadi, admitted in a public speech in Jakarta on August 7th: The Soviet revisionist clique is continuing to provide "military experts" to the Indonesian fascist regime, helping this fascist regime "maintain" its reactionary army.

Muryadi also revealed in his speech that the Soviet revisionists are fulfilling their agreement signed last year with the Indonesian fascist regime, supplying this fascist regime with spare parts for military aircraft and ships.

The Suharto-Nasution fascist regime recently used these aircraft to bomb the areas of revolutionary armed activities in East Java. This fascist regime has also recently deployed aircraft and ships provided by the Soviet revisionists to carry out counter-revolutionary "encirclement and suppression" of the revolutionary armed forces in West Kalimantan.

According to another report, the Soviet revisionist clique's ambassador to Indonesia, Sedyanko, held a secret meeting with the Indonesian fascist regime's Minister of Trade, the old right-wing leader Sumitro, at the beginning of August to conspire on further collusion between the Soviet revisionists and the Indonesian reactionaries. During this meeting, Sedyanko expressed the Soviet revisionist clique's desire to "expand trade relations" with the Indonesian fascist regime, and Sumitro expressed "interest" in this desire of the Soviet revisionists.

    苏修驻印尼代办无耻宣扬全世界都知道苏修“援助”印尼反动派
    新华社二十五日讯　雅加达消息：苏修叛徒集团正在继续向印度尼西亚法西斯军人政权提供“军事顾问”和军事装备，同这个法西斯政权合伙镇压印尼人民的革命武装斗争，赤裸裸地暴露了苏修叛徒集团的反共反人民反革命的狰狞面目。
    据西方通讯社报道，苏修叛徒集团驻印尼大使馆的代办二十四日在雅加达，对苏修和印尼法西斯政权之间的这种反革命勾结，作了一次公开的招供。他毫不知羞耻地对雅加达的一批右派学生吹嘘说：“让我提醒你们，苏联在援助印度尼西亚，全世界都知道这一点。”的确，全世界都知道苏修在援助印尼反动派，镇压印尼人民。
    据西方通讯社报道，苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯政权的海军司令穆尔亚迪八月七日在雅加达的一次公开讲话中承认：苏修叛徒集团正在继续向印尼法西斯政权提供“军事专家”，帮助这个法西斯政权“维持”其反动军队。
    穆尔亚迪在这个讲话中还透露，苏修正在履行它去年与印尼法西斯政权签定的协定，向这个法西斯政权供应军用飞机和舰艇用的零件。
    苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯政权最近就是使用这些飞机，对东爪哇人民革命武装活动的地区进行了轰炸。这个法西斯政权最近一个时期还出动苏修提供的飞机和舰艇，对西加里曼丹人民革命武装进行反革命“围剿”。
    另据报道，苏修叛徒集团驻印尼大使塞坚科八月初同印尼法西斯政权的贸易部长、老右派头子苏米特罗进行了密谈，就苏修与印尼反动派的进一步勾结进行阴谋策划。塞坚科在这次会谈中曾表示了苏修叛徒集团要同印尼法西斯政权“扩大贸易关系的愿望”，苏米特罗对苏修的这种愿望“表示有兴趣”。
