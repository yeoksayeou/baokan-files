The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Australia (Marxist-Leninist) issued a statement on August 28, strongly condemning the heinous crime of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique's armed invasion of Czechoslovakia.

The statement said: "The Russian occupation of Czechoslovakia has nothing in common with communism or Marxism-Leninism. It is anti-republican and anti-Marxist-Leninist. All revolutionaries condemn this.

"The leaders of the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia are not communists, nor are they Marxist-Leninists. They have long since betrayed communism and Marxism-Leninism. Both groups are traitors to communism. However, they have fallen out, just as robbers often do.

"Their quarrel is not a dispute between communists or Marxist-Leninists, but a quarrel between two gangs of robbers, two capitalist groups, a quarrel over how to divide the fruits of exploitation of the Czechoslovak and Soviet peoples.

"The Soviet leaders represent the bourgeoisie of the Soviet Union, and the Czechoslovak leaders represent the bourgeoisie of Czechoslovakia. No matter how many communist phrases they use, they cannot hide their capitalist essence.

"The Czechoslovak leaders found that turning the Czechoslovak economy towards the West was more beneficial to them. The Soviet leaders objected to this. Like other imperialist countries, Russia forcibly opposed this. The victims are the Czechoslovak people. The tragedy suffered by the Czechoslovak people is caused by the revisionist clique that usurped the leadership of the excellent Czechoslovak Communist Party. Everyone can see that the head of American imperialism, Johnson, reacted quite calmly to the Soviet action. Of course, he does not like the expansion of another imperialism, but at the same time, he understands this. He declared that the Soviet action would not hinder the easing of relations between American imperialism and the Soviet Union, that is, American and Soviet imperialism would continue to collude and dominate the world.

"Kosygin and Johnson must have reached an agreement on the spheres of influence of American imperialism and the Soviet Union at Glassboro. The spheres of influence are determined by the military forces of the two countries. The Soviet Union has troops stationed on the Czechoslovak border. Therefore, Czechoslovakia is within its sphere of influence. All this is based on the logic of imperialist robbers.

"The Czechoslovak people will undoubtedly fight against their own revisionist leaders and the reactionaries within Czechoslovakia who have betrayed them. They will certainly return to the revolutionary path, to the path of Marxism-Leninism. They will certainly rebuild a true Marxist-Leninist party, which will lead them in the revolutionary struggle against Soviet occupation, against Czechoslovak revisionists and reactionaries.

"Similarly, this incident will greatly help the Soviet people to recognize the true fascist imperialist nature of the Soviet revisionist clique. The actions of this clique will hasten the day when the Soviet people will rebel and uphold the fruits of the October Revolution to the end.

"The various revisionist cliques around the world, which have usurped the name of communism, have already undergone fundamental upheavals. Before this incident, they had already disintegrated. Now, the situation of disintegration has accelerated greatly."

The statement condemns the Australian Alonzo revisionist clique as being of the same ilk as the Soviet and Czechoslovak revisionists, equally treacherous anti-communists.

The statement points out that the spokesmen for Australian capitalists condemn the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, not out of any love for freedom or anti-fascism, but out of the capitalists' distress at seeing the object of contention seized by a competing imperialist.

The statement says: "Australian revolutionaries, together with the revolutionary people of the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and all other countries, will concentrate their firepower to strike at the Soviet revisionist clique, the center of revisionist harm, and to strike at the Australian revisionist clique, which is so shamelessly dependent on this world center of revisionism." The statement concludes: "No matter what the result of the Soviet invasion is, no matter whether the Soviet army withdraws from Czechoslovakia, the revisionist clique is obviously traitorous. Nothing can save them from destruction. They will drown in the vast sea of people's struggle."

### 强烈谴责苏修侵占捷克斯洛伐克的滔天罪行

    澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义）中央发表声明
    强烈谴责苏修侵占捷克斯洛伐克的滔天罪行
    澳大利亚革命者决心同苏联、捷克斯洛伐克和各国的革命人民同心协力，狠狠打击修正主义祸害的中心——苏修集团
    新华社墨尔本二十八日电　澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义）中央委员会二十八日发表声明，强烈谴责苏修叛徒集团武装侵略捷克斯洛伐克的滔天罪行。
    声明说：“俄国占领捷克斯洛伐克，同共产主义、马克思列宁主义毫无共同之处。它是反共和反马克思列宁主义的。所有的革命者都对此加以痛斥。
      “苏联领导人和捷克斯洛伐克领导人不是共产党人，也不是马克思列宁主义者。他们早就背弃了共产主义、马克思列宁主义。这两个集团都是共产主义的叛徒。但是，他们闹翻了，就象强盗经常闹翻了一样。
      “他们之间的争吵，不是共产党人、马克思列宁主义者之间的争论，而是两伙强盗、两个资本主义集团之间的争吵，是关系到如何处理剥削捷克斯洛伐克人民和苏联人民所得来的果实的争吵。
    “苏联领导人代表的是苏联的资产阶级，捷克斯洛伐克领导人代表的是捷克斯洛伐克的资产阶级。不管他们使用多少共产主义的词句，也掩盖不了他们的资本主义本质。
      “捷克斯洛伐克领导人发现使捷克斯洛伐克经济倒向西方对他们有更大的好处。苏联领导人对此表示异议。和其他帝国主义国家一样，俄国以武力强行反对。受害的却是捷克斯洛伐克人民。捷克斯洛伐克人民遭受的这场悲剧，是由篡夺了优秀的捷克斯洛伐克共产党领导权的修正主义集团造成的。谁都会看到，美帝国主义的头子约翰逊对苏联这一行动的反应是相当平静的。当然，他对另一个帝国主义的扩张是不喜欢的，但是同时他对这一点却是理解的。他声明，苏联的行动将不会妨碍美帝国主义和苏联之间关系的缓和，即苏美帝国主义将继续进行勾结，主宰世界。
      “柯西金和约翰逊在葛拉斯堡罗肯定已经就美帝和苏联的势力范围达成协议。势力范围是由这两个国家各自的军事力量决定的。苏联在捷克斯洛伐克边境驻有军队。因此，捷克斯洛伐克是在它的势力范围内。这一切所根据的是帝国主义的强盗逻辑。
      “捷克斯洛伐克人民无疑将同他们自己的修正主义领导人和出卖他们的捷克斯洛伐克国内的反动派展开斗争。他们一定会回到革命、回到马克思列宁主义的道路上来。他们一定会重建一个真正的马克思列宁主义党，这个党将领导他们展开反对苏联占领，反对捷克斯洛伐克修正主义者和反动派的革命斗争。
    “同样地，这个事件也大大有助于苏联人民认识苏修集团的真正的法西斯帝国主义本质。这个集团的行为将使苏联人民起来造反和把十月革命的成果坚持到底的日子早日到来。
      “盗用共产主义名义的全世界各修正主义集团已经发生根本动摇。在这个事件以前，他们早已分崩离析了。现在，这种分崩离析的情况大大加快了。”
    声明谴责澳大利亚阿隆斯修正主义集团同苏修和捷修是一路货色，是同样阴险的反共老手。
    声明指出，澳大利亚资本家的代言人谴责苏联侵略捷克斯洛伐克，不是出于任何热爱自由的反法西斯的感情，而是出于资本家们看到争夺的东西被一个竞争的帝国主义者抢走而引起的苦恼。
    声明说：“澳大利亚的革命者同苏联、捷克斯洛伐克和所有其他国家的革命人民同心协力，集中火力来打击苏修集团这个修正主义祸害的中心，来打击如此无耻地依附这个修正主义世界中心的澳大利亚修正主义集团。”声明最后说：“不管苏联侵略的结果如何，不管苏军是否从捷克斯洛伐克撤走，修正主义集团显然都是叛徒。没有任何东西能挽救他们的灭亡。他们将淹死在人民斗争的汪洋大海之中。”
