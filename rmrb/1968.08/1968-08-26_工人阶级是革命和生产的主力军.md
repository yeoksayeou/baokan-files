To the Editor:

I participated in the "support-left" work at the Yantai Grape Wine Factory and witnessed firsthand that "the working class has the most foresight, is selfless, and is the most thorough in revolution." They play the role of the "locomotive" in both revolution and production.

The Yantai Grape Wine Factory, formerly known as "Changyu Company," was one of the reactionary strongholds of imperialist aggression against China before liberation, a nest of traitors and spies. After liberation, a small clique of capitalist roaders within the Party treated these traitors, spies, and collaborators as their "pillars," allowing them to control the factory's production and financial affairs. These elements, in collusion with each other, carried out the reactionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, vigorously promoting capitalist management with "expert management," "material incentives," and "bonus incentives," and crazily attempting to restore capitalism.

The great leader Chairman Mao personally ignited the flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The working class of the Jiaodong Peninsula, with its glorious revolutionary tradition, rose up in rebellion! The working class of the Yantai Grape Wine Factory also rose up in rebellion! With great revolutionary spirit, they seized back the party, government, financial, and cultural powers that had been usurped by a small clique of capitalist roaders within the Party.

Once the working class became the masters of the factory, they achieved great results. They followed Chairman Mao's latest instructions resolutely and implemented them thoroughly, standing at the forefront of revolutionary production, making the entire factory's revolution and production vibrant and thriving, creating a great situation.

The better the situation, the more the class enemies want to sabotage and disrupt. A small clique of unrepentant capitalist roaders and traitors within the factory are always looking for opportunities to strike, trying to seize the reins of power back from the working class.

Last September, during the peak grape harvest season, four million jin of ripe grapes needed to be rushed for harvest. If they were not picked, they would rot in the vineyards, and the entire year's production would have to stop. The class enemies were well aware of this and were running around, stirring up trouble, and inciting discord among the mass organizations, attempting to achieve their goal of sabotaging the revolution and production.

However, the class enemies miscalculated. Chairman Mao's good workers did not fall for their tricks. The entire factory's thirteen organizations, following Chairman Mao's great teaching that "within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest," held Mao Zedong Thought study classes. In these classes, they fought against selfishness and dismantled factions, making the revolutionary great alliance more solid.

The class enemies, failing in one scheme, came up with another. They directly interfered with production, attempting to smear the face of the working class. Last December, there was a batch of export orders to be completed by the end of the year. The workers worked day and night, and box after box of red wine was shipped out of the workshop. However, upon inspection, it was found to be substandard. What was the reason? Upon investigation, it was found that the class enemies had played tricks in one of the processes. The workers immediately exposed this culprit.

The delivery date was approaching, what should be done? The workers responded loudly: We must complete the delivery ahead of schedule and not let the working class down! The working class, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, with their hearts for the motherland and eyes on the world, are not afraid of any difficulties. They worked in shifts without leaving the line and produced another batch of red wine that met export standards, completing the export order ahead of schedule and giving a resounding slap in the face to the domestic and foreign class enemies.

After the establishment of the revolutionary committee, the working class again showed leadership in the struggle, criticism, and transformation. They abolished the cumbersome departments of the past and established revolutionary, people-oriented service teams. The members of the revolutionary committee usually only had one or two people in charge of work, while the rest went to the workshops to labor and carried out the struggle, criticism, and transformation with the workers.

In the first half of this year, the entire factory's wine production exceeded the target by 26.9% and increased by 70% compared to the same period last year. Such a high level of production is unprecedented in the factory's history.

During the "support-left" process, we received great education and truly saw that the working class is the leading class and the vanguard of revolution and production. We must learn from the working class's outstanding qualities of being absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, stand with the working class, and seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    工人阶级是革命和生产的主力军编辑同志：
    我在烟台葡萄酿酒厂参加支左工作，亲眼看到了“工人阶级最有远见，大公无私，最富于革命的彻底性。”他们在革命和生产中起着
  “火车头”的作用。
    烟台葡萄酿酒厂，过去叫“张裕公司”。这个酒厂解放前是帝国主义侵略中国的反动堡垒之一，是汉奸、特务的巢穴。解放后，厂里党内一小撮走资派又把汉奸、叛徒、特务当成自己的“台柱子”，让他们掌管全厂的生产和财政大权。这些家伙勾结起来，秉承中国赫鲁晓夫的黑旨意，拚命推行反革命修正主义路线，大搞“专家治厂”“物质刺激”“奖金挂帅”的资本主义经营，疯狂地复辟资本主义。
    伟大领袖毛主席亲手点燃了无产阶级文化大革命的烈火，有着光荣革命传统的胶东半岛的工人阶级起来造反了！烟台葡萄酿酒厂的工人阶级也起来造反了！他们以大无畏的革命精神，一举夺回了被党内一小撮走资派把持的党政财文大权。
    工人阶级做了工厂的主人，就能创造出伟大的成绩。他们对毛主席的一系列最新指示，坚决紧跟，条条落实，站在革命生产第一线，使整个工厂革命轰轰烈烈，生产热气腾腾，出现了一片大好形势。
    形势越好，阶级敌人越要进行破坏捣乱。厂内一小撮死不改悔的走资派和叛徒、特务，无时无刻不在窥测方向，以求一逞，妄图把印把子再从工人阶级手中夺回去。
    去年九月，正是葡萄收获的大忙季节。四百万斤成熟了的葡萄，要突击抢收，如果收摘不下来，烂在葡萄园里，全年的生产就要停下来。阶级敌人很清楚这一点，他们上窜下跳，煽阴风，点邪火，挑拨群众组织之间的关系，妄图达到破坏革命和生产的目的。
    可是，阶级敌人错打了算盘。毛主席的好工人根本不听这一套。全厂十三个组织，遵照毛主席“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突”的伟大教导，大办毛泽东思想学习班。在学习班里，他们斗私心，搬山头，使革命的大联合越来越巩固。
    阶级敌人一计不成又生一计。他们直接插手破坏生产，妄图往工人阶级脸上抹灰。去年十二月，有一批出口定货，准备在年底交齐。工人们日夜奋战，一箱箱红葡萄酒运出车间，可是一鉴定，不合格。是什么原因？经查对，是阶级敌人在一道工序上玩了鬼花招。工人们立即把这个坏蛋揪了出来。
    交货的日子一天天接近，怎么办？工人们响亮地回答：我们一定提前交货，不能给工人阶级丢脸！用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级胸怀祖国，放眼世界，天大的困难也不怕。他们连续顶班不下火线，又生产出一批合乎出口标准的红葡萄酒，提前完成了定货任务，给国内外阶级敌人一记响亮耳光。
    厂革命委员会成立后，工人阶级又在斗、批、改方面显示了领导作用。他们废除了过去这科那科的庞杂机构，成立了革命化的、联系群众的服务小组，革委会成员平时只有一二人主持工作，其余的都到车间劳动，和工人一起搞斗、批、改。
    今年上半年，全厂酿酒生产超额完成百分之二十六点九，比去年同期增长百分之七十。这样高的生产水平，在厂史上是第一次。
    在支左过程中，我们受到了很大教育，真正看到工人阶级是领导阶级，是革命和生产的主力军。我们一定要学习工人阶级无限忠于毛主席的优秀品质，和工人阶级在一起，认真搞好斗、批、改，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
