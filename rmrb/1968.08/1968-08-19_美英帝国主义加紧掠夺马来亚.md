U.S. and British Imperialism Intensify Plunder of Malaya

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report, Kuala Lumpur: U.S. and British imperialists are frantically plundering the resources of Malaya and more brutally exploiting the people of Malaya (including Singapore).

	British imperialism still controls the economic lifeline of Malaya. Currently, 60% of the cultivated land in Malaya is planted with rubber, and a large number of rubber plantations are directly controlled by British monopoly capital. The British monopoly capital group has invested 700 million pounds in Malaya, and each year they extract 110 million pounds in profits from Malaya. British imperialists are extremely brutal exploiters who suck the blood and sweat of the Malayan people.

	U.S. imperialism imports large quantities of rubber each year to meet the needs of its military and civilian industries. To make huge profits, it has used various despicable means over the past decade to suppress rubber prices. According to Western news agencies, the puppet leader of "Malaysia," Razak, lamented in February that over the past eight months, due to the price of top-grade rubber falling from $0.20 per pound to $0.15 per pound, "Malaysia's" export income last year lost about $150 million. This fully demonstrates that the brutal exploitation and plunder by U.S. imperialism have severely struck Malaya's economy.

    美英帝国主义加紧掠夺马来亚
    据新华社讯　吉隆坡消息：英美帝国主义正在疯狂地掠夺马来亚的资源，更加残酷地剥削马来亚（包括新加坡）人民。
    英帝国主义至今仍然控制着马来亚的经济命脉。目前，马来亚已耕种地的百分之六十种植橡胶，而大量的橡胶园都在英国垄断资本的直接控制之下。英国垄断资本集团在马来亚的投资有七亿英镑，每年从马来亚榨取的利润达到一亿一千万英镑之多。英帝国主义者是吸吮马来亚人民血汗的极其残暴的剥削者。
    美帝国主义每年输入大量橡胶来应付它的军事和民用工业的需要。为了赚取大量利润，它在过去十多年来，反复使用种种卑鄙手段来压低橡胶价格。据西方通讯社报道，“马来西亚”傀儡集团头目拉札克今年二月间凄怆地指出，过去八个月中，由于上等橡胶的价格从每磅零点二美元降低到零点一五美元，“马来西亚”去年的出口收入就损失了约一亿五千万美元。这充分表明，美帝国主义的残酷剥削和掠夺沉重地打击了马来亚的经济。
