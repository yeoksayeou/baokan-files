The Burmese Communist Party, led by Thakin Than Tun, has adhered to the proletarian revolutionary line of "winning the war and seizing power." Over the past year, they have led the Burmese people to achieve significant victories in crushing the large-scale counter-revolutionary "encirclement and suppression" launched by the Burmese reactionary government, consolidating revolutionary base areas, and developing revolutionary armed forces. The revolutionary situation in Burma is excellent.

Since last August, the Burmese reactionary government, with the support of U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionist leadership clique, mobilized dozens of battalions, including the "77th" and "88th" divisions, which were re-equipped and expanded with U.S. weapons, to launch a mad and sustained attack on the Burmese Communist Party's revolutionary base areas such as the Bago Mountains. They attempted to annihilate the Burmese people's armed forces.

Under the battle call of "crushing the enemy's attack with an offensive" issued by Chairman Thakin Than Tun and the Burmese Communist Party Central Committee, the Burmese people's armed forces and the broad masses in the base areas actively and proactively engaged in the battle. When the enemy's forces were deep inside the base areas and exhausted, the Burmese people's armed forces launched multiple ambushes in the Pakokku and Zigon regions, annihilating the enemy in whole platoons and companies, forcing the enemy to retreat in disarray. At the same time, the Burmese people's armed forces in the Bago region took the initiative to attack the towns of Bago, Pyinmana, Thayawaddy, and Taungoo, which were under enemy occupation, and to sabotage the Yangon-Mandalay and Yangon-Pyinmana railways and other transportation lines, effectively supporting the base areas' anti-"encirclement and suppression" battles. The brave fighting of the Burmese people's armed forces defended the revolutionary base areas, causing the enemy's counter-revolutionary "encirclement and suppression" to suffer a complete failure. Although the Burmese reactionary government has been strictly censoring news to cover up its defeat, incomplete statistics show that from last August to this May, over a period of ten months, the Burmese Communist Party's people's armed forces engaged in more than 140 battles in the Bago Mountains and surrounding areas, annihilating a large number of enemy forces and dealing heavy blows to the enemy.

In the past year, the people's armed forces in other parts of Burma have also frequently taken the initiative to launch attacks and have been very active. In the Irrawaddy Delta and the Danai-Salwin region in southeastern Burma, the Burmese people's armed forces have repeatedly attacked towns and water and land transportation lines in the Bago, Myaungmya, Mawlamyine, Thayetmyo, and Danubyu regions, striking and annihilating the enemy, achieving significant victories. In the Arakan region of southwestern Burma and Upper Burma, reports of victories by the Burmese people's armed forces have also frequently been heard.

In the past year, the Burmese people's armed forces have used flexible guerrilla tactics, often concentrating superior forces to launch offensive strikes, achieving increasingly significant victories, and repeatedly annihilating the enemy in whole platoons and companies. They have also seized a large number of the enemy's weapons and supplies to equip themselves. On November 21 last year, the Burmese Communist Party's people's armed forces annihilated two enemy platoons equipped with U.S. automatic weapons in the Bago Mountains, seizing one mortar, nine various types of guns, and a large amount of military supplies. On December 29, the Burmese Communist Party's Thayetmyo Sea Guerrilla Squad intercepted five fishing boats belonging to the reactionary government. The enemy sent a company of troops to seize the boats, and the people's armed forces ambushed them on their march, capturing more than 30 enemy soldiers and seizing more than 30 various types of guns. On March 4 this year, about 200 members of the National Democratic United Front's armed forces, in three columns, occupied a police station on the eastern bank of the Sittaung River in the Thayetmyo District of the Bago region. On March 6, the Burmese Communist Party's people's armed forces concentrated their forces to occupy the town of An in the Arakan region for 24 hours, destroying police barracks, warehouses, and communication facilities, and seizing a large number of weapons, ammunition, and supplies. Between March and May, the Burmese Communist Party's people's armed forces and the armed forces of various ethnic groups in Burma continued to achieve multiple large-scale victories in annihilating the enemy in the Danai-Salwin and Irrawaddy Delta regions.

In addition, on April 29, members of the armed forces and the masses of the National Democratic United Front of Burma, in four columns, attacked the town of Kyaukkyi in the Bago region, seizing a large amount of supplies from the reactionary government's warehouses. In the early hours of June 2, the Burmese Communist Party's people's armed forces and militias attacked a police outpost in the town of Lelpbin in the Bago region. At the same time, another group of people's armed forces, in coordination with this battle, attacked another area near the town. In these two battles, the Burmese people's armed forces fought against the large number of reactionary Burmese army units, including the 6th and 17th Infantry Battalions, which came to suppress them, and were unable to withstand the attack. On June 7, the armed forces of the National Democratic United Front of Burma, in coordination with the armed forces that had already entered the town of Maunggwe in the Irrawaddy region, attacked the town and seized a large amount of supplies from three "People's Stores" of the Burmese reactionary government.

The Burmese people's armed forces frequently attack the water and land transportation lines heavily guarded by the Burmese reactionary government, causing the Yangon-Mandalay and Yangon-Pyinmana railways and some roads and water transportation to frequently fall into paralysis. According to the Burmese reactionary newspapers, in late May alone, the Burmese people's armed forces blew up enemy armored vehicles and trains on the Yangon-Mandalay and Yangon-Pyinmana railways four times. On the evening of May 29, the Karen people's armed forces attacked a train station five miles north of Bago, burning the station facilities and cutting the telephone and telegraph lines. On the evening of June 21, the Burmese people's armed forces blew up an armored train with landmines in the Thayetmyo District, annihilating an entire enemy platoon and seizing three machine guns, two rifles, and a batch of ammunition. On June 28, the Burmese Communist Party's people's armed forces burned a bridge on the Binlebu-Kalaw road in northern Burma. On July 4, the Burmese people's armed forces intercepted two motorized sailing boats belonging to the reactionary government off the coast of Thayetmyo County, seizing a large amount of supplies.

The Burmese reactionary government is very frightened by the battles of the people's armed forces on the water and land transportation lines. The reactionary authorities in the Bago, Pyinmana, Thayetmyo, and Taungoo regions around Yangon announced a curfew from 6 PM to 6 AM along the railway lines at the end of June and the beginning of July, in an attempt to protect the safety of the railways. In addition to frequently dispatching military ships to escort ships from Bago to Yangon, the Burmese reactionary authorities recently ordered the installation of half-human-high protective steel plates on the ships.

While carrying out revolutionary armed struggles, the Burmese Communist Party, according to the different characteristics of revolutionary base areas, guerrilla zones, and enemy-occupied areas, has adopted various forms to extensively and deeply mobilize the masses. The Burmese Communist Party has led the broad masses of poor peasants in revolutionary base areas and guerrilla zones to extensively carry out struggles to protect grain from being plundered by the Burmese reactionary government, and struggles to eliminate traitors and local tyrants. Land reforms are being carried out in the rural areas of Bago, Bago, and Myaungmya counties. Awakened peasants are destroying the reactionary political power and economic institutions of the Burmese reactionary government in the countryside, establishing red grassroots political power. Many young peasants are actively joining the people's armed forces and militias, taking up arms to join the revolutionary armed struggle. Under the inspiration of the Burmese people's revolutionary armed struggle and peasant movement, in the more than 30 towns under the rule of the Burmese reactionary government, such as Mandalay, Bago, and Arakan, large-scale grain looting and anti-hunger demonstrations broke out in July and August last year.

　　打破反革命“围剿”  巩固革命根据地  集中优势兵力歼敌
　　缅共人民武装一年来打出一片好形势
    新华社十四日讯　本社记者报道：以德钦丹东同志为首的缅甸共产党，坚持“赢得战争，夺取政权”的无产阶级革命路线，领导缅甸人民，在过去一年来取得了粉碎缅甸反动政府发动的大规模反革命“围剿”、巩固革命根据地和发展革命武装力量的重大胜利。缅甸的革命形势一片大好。
    去年八月以来，缅甸反动政府在美帝国主义和苏修领导集团的支持下，动员了几十个营的兵力，其中包括用美国武器重新装备和扩编的第“七十七”和“八十八”两个师的部队，向缅共武装革命根据地勃固山区等地，发动了疯狂的持续的进攻，妄图消灭缅甸人民武装。
　　以进攻粉碎敌人的进攻
    在德钦丹东主席和缅共中央的“以进攻粉碎敌人的进攻”这一战斗号召下，缅甸人民武装和根据地广大革命人民积极、主动地投入了战斗。缅甸人民武装在敌人深入根据地到处扑空、疲惫不堪的时候，在包康、只光地区多次伏击敌人，整班、整排地歼灭敌人，迫使敌人狼狈后撤。与此同时，缅甸人民武装在勃固地区，主动进攻敌人占领下的勃固、卑谬、达雅瓦底、东吁等县的城镇，袭击破坏仰光—曼德勒、仰光—卑谬铁路等交通线，有力地配合了根据地的反“围剿”战斗。缅甸人民武装的英勇作战，保卫了革命根据地，使敌人的反革命“围剿”遭到彻底破产。尽管缅甸反动政府为了掩盖它的惨败，一直严密封锁消息，但据不完全的统计，从去年八月到今年五月的十个月中，缅共人民武装在勃固山区及附近地区共作战一百四十多次，大量歼灭敌人，给敌人以沉重打击。
    缅甸其他各地人民武装在过去一年里也经常主动出击，十分活跃。在伊洛瓦底三角洲和缅甸东南部的丹那沙林地区，缅甸人民武装多次袭击勃生、渺?、毛淡棉、土瓦、丹老等县的一些城镇和水陆交通线，打击和消灭敌人，取得了重大胜利。在缅甸西南部的若开地区和上缅甸，也经常传来缅甸人民武装的捷报。
　　夺取敌人装备武装自己
    缅甸人民武装在过去一年里，采用机动灵活的游击战术，经常集中优势兵力主动出击，取得越来越大的战果，多次整班整排地歼灭敌人，并且夺取敌人的大批武器和物资装备自己。去年十一月二十一日，缅共人民武装在勃固山麓一次歼灭了用美国自动武器装备的两个班的敌人，缴获迫击炮一门，各种枪支九支以及许多军用物资。十二月二十九日，缅共土瓦海上游击队截获了反动政府的五艘渔轮，敌人派一连兵力赶来抢夺渔轮，人民武装在敌人行军途中进行伏击，俘虏敌军三十多名，缴获各种枪支三十多支。今年三月四日，民族民主团结阵线武装约二百人，分三路攻占了勃固地区东吁县锡当河东岸的一所警察局。三月六日，缅共人民武装集中兵力，攻占若开地区的安镇达二十四小时，破坏了警察营房、仓库和电讯设备，缴获大量武器弹药和物资。在三月到五月间，缅共人民武装和缅甸各族人民武装，在丹那沙林和伊洛瓦底三角洲等地区，继续取得了多次大规模歼敌的胜利。
    此外，在四月二十九日，缅甸民族民主团结阵线武装人员和群众，分四路攻入勃固县皎德加镇，从反动政府的仓库中缴获大批物资。六月二日凌晨，缅共人民武装和民兵，袭击了勃固县良札彬镇的警察哨所。同时，另一批人民武装配合这次战斗，袭击了这个镇附近的另一个地区。缅甸人民武装在这两次战斗中，打得前来镇压的缅甸反动军队第六和第十七步兵营等大批部队无法招架。六月七日，缅甸民族民主团结阵线武装，同事先进入伊洛瓦底地区毛礼镇的武装人员里应外合，袭击了这个镇，并且从缅甸反动政府的三家“人民商店”中缴获了大批物资。
　　袭击交通线打击敌后方
    缅甸人民武装频繁地袭击缅甸反动政府重兵保护下的水陆交通线，使仰光—曼德勒、仰光—卑谬铁路和一些公路及水上航运经常陷于瘫痪。据缅甸反动报纸透露，仅在五月下旬，缅甸人民武装在仰光—曼德勒、仰光—卑谬铁路上，四次炸毁敌人的军警装甲车辆和火车。五月二十九日晚，克伦族人民武装袭击了勃固北面五英里的一个火车站，烧毁了车站设备，切断了电话和电报线路。六月二十一日晚，缅甸人民武装在东吁县境内用地雷炸毁一列护路装甲列车，全歼敌人一个班，缴获了三挺机枪、两支步枪和一批弹药。六月二十八日，缅共人民武装在缅北彬勒布一科林公路上烧毁一座桥。七月四日，缅甸人民武装在土瓦县沿海截获反动政府的两艘机帆船，缴获了大量物资。
    缅甸反动政府对人民武装在水陆交通线上的战斗，感到十分惊恐。仰光周围的勃固、卑谬、达雅瓦底、东吁等县的反动当局，在六月底和七月初纷纷宣布在每晚六时到次晨六时，在铁路沿线实行戒严，妄图以此来保护铁路的安全。缅甸反动当局除了经常派出军用船艇，给从勃生到仰光的轮船护航之外，最近又下令在轮船上加装半人高的防护钢板。
　　发动群众展开斗争建立政权
    缅甸共产党在开展革命武装斗争的同时，按照革命根据地、游击区和敌占区的不同特点，采取各种形式，广泛深入地发动了群众。缅甸共产党领导革命根据地和游击区的广大贫苦农民，广泛开展了反对缅甸反动政府掠夺粮食的护粮斗争，开展了锄奸反霸斗争。在勃固、勃生、渺?等县的农村里，正在进行土地改革。觉醒的农民纷纷起来摧毁缅甸反动政府在农村中的反动政权和进行掠夺的经济机构，建立红色基层政权。许多青年农民积极参加人民武装和民兵，拿起武器投入革命武装斗争。在缅甸人民革命武装斗争和农民运动的鼓舞下，在缅甸反动政府统治下的曼德勒、勃固、若开等三十多个城镇，去年七、八月间爆发了规模空前的抢粮和反饥饿示威。
