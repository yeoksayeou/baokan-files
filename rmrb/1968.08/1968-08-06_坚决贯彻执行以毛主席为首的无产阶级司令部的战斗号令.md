Two years ago, Chairman Mao's big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters" issued a call to arms for us to launch a general offensive against the bourgeois headquarters headed by the Chinese Khrushchev. Now, this bourgeois headquarters has collapsed, and the country has seen an unprecedentedly good situation. Today, as we reread Chairman Mao's "Bombard the Headquarters" big-character poster, we love, are loyal to, admire, and believe in our great leader Chairman Mao even more.

A small clique of capitalist roaders within the party in our factory, following the instructions of the Chinese Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionist elements Peng Zhen and Lu Dingyi, used the power they had usurped in the factory to surrender and recruit traitors, shield and promote bad elements, and impose bourgeois dictatorship on the broad revolutionary masses. What is particularly infuriating is that they colluded with each other, acting in concert, on the one hand, madly opposing the broad revolutionary masses in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, using every means to resist the printing of Chairman Mao's works and his brilliant portraits; on the other hand, they printed large quantities of black books and black paintings. According to statistics for the year 1965, our factory printed only 800,000 copies of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," while the print run of the black "Self-Cultivation" reached over 2.5 million copies. This is how they attempted to turn our propaganda front for Mao Zedong Thought into a platform for spreading the propaganda of capitalist restoration.

Under the inspiration of Chairman Mao's "Bombard the Headquarters" big-character poster, all the revolutionary masses in our factory rose up to seize power from the small clique of capitalist roaders within the party, establishing a revolutionary power organ of the proletariat—the Revolutionary Committee.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power." To consolidate the great achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the factory Revolutionary Committee, with the strong support and assistance of the PLA's leftist cadres, closely follows Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, leading the broad revolutionary masses of the entire factory to actively and proactively launch a sustained offensive against a small handful of class enemies.

Chairman Mao recently taught us: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between proletarian dictatorship and bourgeois dictatorship." In the struggle against the enemy, we resolutely implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, strictly distinguishing between two types of contradictions. For true class enemies, such as traitors, spies, and all hidden counter-revolutionaries, we strike them down mercilessly, imposing proletarian dictatorship on them without mercy; for those who have made serious mistakes in the movement, we patiently educate them, helping them to awaken and return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We deeply feel that: giving the policy to the masses, relying on the proletarian revolutionaries, and uniting all forces that can be united, we can isolate the enemy to the greatest extent, and strike the enemy steadily, accurately, and fiercely. Striking the class enemy steadily, accurately, and fiercely is the most effective protection for the broad masses of the people.

We have also implemented Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, deeply and persistently carried out revolutionary criticism, combining revolutionary criticism with the cleaning of class ranks, and combining the criticism of revisionism with the establishment of Mao Zedong Thought in the mind. This has greatly aroused the initiative and self-awareness of the broad revolutionary masses in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the struggle, greatly raising the class struggle consciousness and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad revolutionary masses.

As Comrade Lin Biao pointed out: "The people's revolution under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought is the locomotive of historical progress." The revolutionary masses of our factory have never been as spirited and full of fighting spirit as they are now. We proletarian revolutionaries have taken power, and everyone is united in heart and mind, with one goal: to turn the printing factory into an important front for propagating Mao Zedong Thought, and we will not allow the class enemy to interfere and disrupt. On the eve of July 1st this year, to welcome the 47th anniversary of the birth of the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China, and to deliver the revolutionary oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan" to the broad revolutionary masses as soon as possible, the revolutionary masses of our factory, with boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, worked day and night in the workshop. In just a few days, we rushed to print millions of copies of the color oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan." In the past, under the control of a small clique of capitalist roaders, our factory wasted state funds at will, leaving two brand-new modern printing machines idle for more than ten years, with some parts already rusted. During this rush to print the large oil painting "Chairman Mao Goes to Anshan," the revolutionary working class displayed the revolutionary spirit of daring to think and dare to do, repairing the machines in just a few days, making them spin rapidly, and contributing to the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought.

In the future, no matter what the circumstances, we will unshakably follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, resolutely implement the various instructions of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, continue to fiercely launch the struggle against the enemy, deeply and persistently carry out revolutionary criticism, study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in the struggle, further complete the combat tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation assigned to us by the great leader Chairman Mao, and advance courageously along the path indicated by Chairman Mao!

### 坚决贯彻执行以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的战斗号令

　　坚决贯彻执行以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的战斗号令
　　北京新华印刷厂无产阶级革命派
    两年前，毛主席写的《炮打司令部》的大字报，向我们发出了向以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部发起总攻击的动员令。现在，这个资产阶级司令部已经土崩瓦解了，全国出现了从未有过的大好形势。今天，我们重读毛主席《炮打司令部》的大字报，对伟大领袖毛主席更加无限热爱，无限忠诚，无限崇拜，无限信仰。
    我厂党内一小撮走资派，秉承中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命修正主义分子彭真、陆定一的意旨，利用他们在工厂窃取的权力，招降纳叛，包庇和重用坏人，对广大革命职工实行资产阶级专政。尤其令人气愤的是：他们相互勾结，串通一气，一方面疯狂反对广大革命职工活学活用毛主席著作，千方百计地抵制印制毛主席的著作和毛主席的光辉画像；另一方面却大量印刷黑书、黑画。据一九六五年一年的统计，我厂印制《毛泽东选集》只有八十万册，而黑《修养》的印数竟达二百五十多万册。他们就是这样妄图把我们这个毛泽东思想的宣传阵地变为传播资本主义复辟舆论的场所。
    在毛主席《炮打司令部》大字报的鼓舞下，我们全厂无产阶级革命派，起来夺了我厂党内一小撮走资派的权，建立起无产阶级的革命权力机构——革命委员会。
    毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”为了巩固无产阶级文化大革命取得的伟大成果，厂革命委员会在解放军支左人员的大力支持和帮助下，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，率领全厂广大革命群众，积极主动地向一小撮阶级敌人发起了持续的进攻。
    毛主席最近教导我们：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”在对敌斗争中，我们坚决贯彻执行毛主席这一最新指示，严格区别两类不同性质的矛盾。对真正的阶级敌人，如叛徒、特务和一切暗藏的反革命分子，就狠狠地打击，对他们实行无产阶级专政，决不手软；对于在运动中犯有严重错误的人，就进行耐心的教育，使之觉悟，帮助他们重新回到毛主席的革命路线上来。我们深深体会到：把政策交给群众，依靠无产阶级革命派，团结一切可以团结的力量，才能最大限度地孤立敌人，稳、准、狠地打击敌人。对阶级敌人打得稳、准、狠，就是对广大人民群众最有效的保护。
    我们还通过落实毛主席一系列最新指示，深入持久地开展革命的大批判，把革命的大批判和清理阶级队伍结合起来，把批判修正主义和在头脑中大立毛泽东思想结合起来。这样做，大大激发了广大革命职工在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作的积极性和自觉性，大大提高了广大革命职工的阶级斗争觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟。
    正如林彪副主席指出的：“毛泽东思想指引下的人民革命是历史前进的火车头”。我们厂的广大革命群众，从来没有象现在这样意气风发，斗志昂扬。我们无产阶级革命派掌了权，大家一个心眼，一股劲头，就是要把印刷厂变为宣传毛泽东思想的重要阵地，决不允许阶级敌人进行干扰和捣乱。今年“七·一”前夕，为了迎接伟大、光荣、正确的中国共产党诞生四十七周年，为了早日把《毛主席去安源》的革命油画送到广大革命群众手中，我厂广大革命职工怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠诚，夜以继日地奋战在车间。在短短的几天内，就赶印出数以百万计的《毛主席去安源》的彩色油画。过去，我们厂在一小撮走资派的把持下，任意浪费国家资财，将两台全新的现代化的印刷机搁置了十多年，有些机件已经生锈。在这次赶印《毛主席去安源》大幅油画时，革命的工人阶级发扬敢想敢干的革命精神，在短短几天内就抢修好，使它飞速地转动起来，为宣传毛泽东思想贡献了力量。
    今后，不管在任何情况下，我们永远坚定不移地紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚决贯彻执行以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的各项指示，持续地猛烈地开展对敌斗争，深入持久地开展革命的大批判，在斗争中活学活用毛泽东思想，进一步完成伟大领袖毛主席交给我们的斗、批、改的战斗任务，沿着毛主席指引的方向奋勇前进！
