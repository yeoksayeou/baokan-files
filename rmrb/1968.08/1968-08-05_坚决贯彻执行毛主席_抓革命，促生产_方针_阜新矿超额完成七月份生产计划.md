	Firmly Implement Chairman Mao's Policy of "Grasp Revolution, Promote Production" - Fuxin Mine Exceeds July Production Plan

	Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 3rd: The revolutionary workers of the Fuxin Coal Mine Area have firmly implemented Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." On the basis of exceeding the production plan for the second quarter of this year, they have fully exceeded the national production plan for July, producing an additional 33,000 tons of coal for the state.

	Under the guidance of the People's Liberation Army propaganda team stationed at the mine, the revolutionary workers of the Fuxin Coal Mine Area have used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon. With the work unit as the base, they have carried out in-depth revolutionary criticism, fiercely criticizing the "class struggle extinction" theory, "money as the commander," and "material incentives" advocated by China's Khrushchev and his agents. They have also combined revolutionary criticism with the cleansing of class ranks, greatly enhancing the proletarian consciousness and the consciousness of two-line struggle among revolutionary workers, and continuously increasing their enthusiasm for production.

	The revolutionary committees at various levels in the mine area have, through serious study of the experience of Yulin County in implementing the revolutionization of the leading cadre team, streamlining the bureaucracy, and maintaining close ties with the masses, fiercely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line advocated by China's Khrushchev in the construction of political power. They have broken down the old institutions of the past and established new, streamlined, and powerful institutions that are closely linked with the masses. The members of the revolutionary committees have gone deep into the grassroots, eating, living, and working with the workers, timely solving problems in revolution and production, and effectively promoting the development of revolution and production.

　　坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”方针
　　阜新矿超额完成七月份生产计划
    新华社沈阳三日电  阜新煤矿区广大革命职工，坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，在超额完成今年第二季度生产计划的基础上，七月份全面超额完成了国家生产计划，为国家增产煤炭三万三千多吨。
    阜新煤矿区广大革命职工，在驻矿解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，以班组为基点，深入开展革命大批判，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人鼓吹的“阶级斗争熄灭”论、“金钱挂帅”、“物质刺激”等反革命修正主义黑货。他们还把革命大批判和清理阶级队伍紧密结合起来，大大提高了革命职工的无产阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟，生产积极性越来越高。
    矿区各级革命委员会通过认真学习灵宝县实行领导班子革命化，精兵简政，密切联系群众的经验，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面推行的反革命修正主义路线，打破过去的旧机构，建立了革命化的联系群众的精悍有力的新机构。革委会成员深入基层，和工人同吃、同住、同劳动，及时解决革命和生产中的问题，有力地促进了革命和生产的发展。
