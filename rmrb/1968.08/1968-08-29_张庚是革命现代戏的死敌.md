The brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the broad road of the reform of Peking Opera. The eight revolutionary model operas personally cultivated by Comrade Jiang Qing and the piano-accompanied song "The Red Lantern" have transformed the stage of old operas, where feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism once danced wildly, into a new era of dazzling proletarian revolutionary arts unprecedented in human history.

Four years ago, Comrade Jiang Qing, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, led a group of revolutionary cultural warriors to launch a fierce attack on the old Peking Opera, this stubborn fortress, and waged a heart-pounding class struggle on the cultural front. As our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out, "In human history, all reactionary forces that are about to perish will make their last struggles against the revolutionary forces." The Chinese Khrushchev and his accomplices, sensing their impending doom, hated and feared this great Peking Opera revolution to the core, using every conceivable means to sabotage and resist it. Among these villains, Zhang Gan, the agent of the Chinese Khrushchev in the opera world, acted as a particularly vicious thug. He colluded with Zhou Yang, the ringleader of the black line in literature and arts, using all sorts of despicable tricks to oppose Comrade Jiang Qing. They either revealed their ferocious intentions to strangle this revolution, or, under the guise of "supporting" the Peking Opera revolution, secretly emasculated the soul of the revolutionary model operas. They even took to the stage bare-chested, producing counter-revolutionary modern plays to challenge the revolutionary model operas nurtured by Comrade Jiang Qing.

At the end of 1963, Comrade Jiang Qing had instructed the Experimental Troupe of the Chinese Opera Research Institute to adapt the Henan opera "Sunlit Ravine" into a Peking Opera form to reflect socialist revolution and construction. Zhang Gan, who had usurped the leadership position of the Chinese Opera Research Institute, strictly sealed off Comrade Jiang Qing's series of important instructions and refused to carry them out. Instead, he followed Zhou Yang's secret order to "X opera" and decided that "this play is allowed to retain 60 to 70 percent of the Henan opera flavor," turning it into a "bridgehead" to sabotage the Peking Opera revolution. Thus, Hebei clapper opera, Henan clapper opera, Sichuan accompaniment, and Yunnan flower lanterns were all crammed into this play, making it an incoherent "X opera," attempting to use this to prove that Peking Opera cannot reflect socialism. Comrade Jiang Qing saw through their plot and sharply pointed out that the music of "Sunlit Ravine" was not stepping too big, but stepping wrong. Zhang Gan went into a hysterical rage, saying, "To make such a conclusion is to surrender to the conservatives!" He shouted, "We must stand firm against the cold wind and never retreat." Zhang Gan's creation of the "X opera" also harbored the evil intention of providing ammunition for the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries to slander us for "destroying Peking Opera." It was truly vicious and reactionary to the core!

Zhang Gan did not stop at creating a "bridgehead" but also shouted, "We must fight our way out!" With the support of Zhou Yang and others, he meticulously produced a counter-revolutionary black opera that sang the praises of the wrong line and erected monuments for the Chinese Khrushchev and the Peng Zhen clique. The counter-revolutionary revisionist Lin Mo Han watched the rehearsal of this black opera and immediately exclaimed, "Magnificent!" Zhang Gan also boasted about himself, saying that this was the "direction of Peking Opera reform." In one sentence, he revealed his true intentions. It turned out that Zhang Gan's so-called "direction" was to turn revolutionary modern plays into a reactionary tool for the Chinese Khrushchev to seize the party, the army, and the government to create public opinion.

Whether it was using the "X opera" as a "bridgehead" or using the counter-revolutionary black opera to "fight their way out," Zhang Gan's plots were all foiled. Therefore, he extended his black hand to the revolutionary model operas. The power of examples is great. Zhang Gan wanted to chop down a few red flags to ultimately sabotage the Peking Opera revolution.

During the rehearsal of "The Red Lantern," a small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists from the former China Peking Opera Troupe resisted Comrade Jiang Qing's instructions, trying to vilify the heroic characters and exaggerate the tragic atmosphere of separation, using this to promote the philosophy of survival of the Chinese Khrushchev. Zhang Gan saw this and was secretly delighted, supporting it from behind. However, Comrade Jiang Qing, through arduous struggles, reversed the wrong trend, highlighting the proletarian heroic image, highlighting the spirit of revolutionary heroism and revolutionary optimism, making the play undergo a qualitative leap. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers cheered for it, but Zhang Gan gnashed his teeth and quickly called his accomplices, saying that the play was "changed loosely and without substance," "I felt very discouraged after watching it," and even viciously cursed, "The Red Lantern is not the direction!" "It's not solid!" and maliciously cursed, "The Red Lantern has reached its peak, and at a certain stage, it will no longer work!" He must destroy it completely.

The revolutionary model opera "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" was guided by Comrade Jiang Qing to create heroic images armed with Mao Zedong Thought, highlighting Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on "people's war," and received high praise from workers, peasants, and soldiers. However, a small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists hated it to the core and launched a counter-revolutionary attack. Some cursed it as "white water," "third-class seedling." Zhang Gan attacked it as "rough," "not good," and sarcastically said, "This play is impossible to discuss, all the good words have been said by Shanghai!" Amidst this clamor, the notorious poisonous weed "After Watching 'Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy'" was released. This was a big poisonous arrow aimed at Chairman Mao's revolutionary line of literature and arts. This poisonous arrow was shot by Lin Han Biao, a capable subordinate of Zhang Gan, under the instigation of the Lin Mo Han clique. It said what Lin Mo Han and Zhang Gan wanted to say but dared not say. It slandered the heroic character Yang Zirong in the play as "restrained and depressed," advocating that he be written as a "bold, rough, and unrefined" rogue with a strong bandit flavor. It advocated writing a lot about the enemy's "cunning and arrogance," letting the negative characters overwhelm the positive characters, and turning the revolutionary modern play into a strange and bizarre reactionary martial arts play. As soon as the "After Watching 'Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy'" was released, it immediately received a powerful counterattack from Comrade Jiang Qing. Comrade Jiang Qing sternly questioned Zhang Gan and his group, "Are you sitting on the side of the positive characters or the negative characters? I heard that some people oppose writing positive characters, which is wrong." When Comrade Jiang Qing asked about the process of creating this poisonous weed, Zhang Gan blatantly lied to Comrade Jiang Qing, stubbornly defending the old Propaganda Department, attempting to resist to the end!

Extensively promoting the reactionary "theory of supplementing deficiencies," deliberately distorting and belittling the great historical significance of the Peking Opera revolution, was another vicious trick of Zhang Gan to sabotage the Peking Opera revolution. Before the Peking Opera Modern Play Observation and Performance Conference in 1964, the counter-revolutionary revisionist Xia Yan personally wrote a letter, instructing Zhang Gan to polish and produce an editorial for the "Guangming Daily." Zhang Gan, following Xia Yan's nonsense about "today's promotion of Peking Opera performing modern plays is to make up for its deficiencies," fabricated that "traditional plays and modern plays are not opposed," "performing modern plays can make traditional plays better," and so on, brazenly summoning the spirits of emperors, ministers, scholars, and beauties, attempting to turn the wheel of the Peking Opera revolution, fully exposing his counter-revolutionary wolfish ambitions.

What is even more intolerable is that in an article sent abroad, Zhang Gan blatantly distorted right and wrong, shamelessly praising the Chinese Khrushchev's "attention" to the Peking Opera revolution, saying that he "took time out of his busy schedule to watch the performance," and claiming that "this greatly encouraged the Peking Opera artists," making them "full of confidence in victory."

In the face of the great victory of the Peking Opera revolution, Zhang Gan, with his head bleeding and broken, still did not give up, continuing to spread doubts about the Peking Opera revolution, creating public opinion for the return of emperors, ministers, scholars, and beauties. By the end of 1965, he used his old tricks again, once more alarmingly proposing, "Can Peking Opera performing modern plays survive?" and sending people out to "investigate," "How is the situation after Peking Opera performing revolutionary modern plays? Is it an optimistic estimate or a pessimistic estimate?" "Is it irrevocable, or are there many things that have not been done well?" Attempting to collect black materials, prepare ammunition, and launch a counterattack on the Peking Opera revolution!

Zhang Gan's opposition to revolutionary modern plays did not start with the Peking Opera revolution. His counter-revolutionary "theory" has been around for a long time. This long-time "sitting on the side of the negative characters" old counter-revolutionary, for a long time, followed in the footsteps of the Chinese Khrushchev, using his usurped position in the opera theory field, writing articles, giving speeches, and making comments, using "academic research" as a cover to spread malicious slander and distort Chairman Mao's opera revolution policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," creating public opinion for the restoration of capitalist counter-revolution.

In the early days of national liberation, when the seedlings of revolutionary modern plays were just sprouting, the Chinese Khrushchev shouted, "Reflecting modern life cannot be forced," "Do not 'force a birth.'" Zhang Gan immediately mimicked his master's tone, saying that if one thinks that performing modern plays "is serving the people," "he must be too naive." When someone pointed out that opera can only reflect socialist revolution and construction to better serve proletarian politics, Zhang Gan immediately cursed, "This 'theory' is very naive, but it is very common and powerful, so it must be refuted here." He put on an air of "authority," waving the big stick of "Mr. Zhao not allowing revolution," ruthlessly trampling on the young seedlings. Zhang Gan also, following the Chinese Khrushchev's fallacy of "performing more old plays," "everyone has food to eat, and the world is peaceful," maliciously fabricated that the result of performing modern plays was that "artists could not eat." Master and servant sang in unison, using every possible means to strangle the revolutionary modern plays in the cradle.

When Zhang Gan saw the masses enthusiastically welcoming revolutionary modern plays, he pretended to care about revolutionary modern plays, playing another trick of stealing heaven and changing days, removing the soul of revolutionary modern plays, attempting to lead them onto the counter-revolutionary path.

Do you want to reflect socialist life? Zhang Gan would ask the authors to learn from the poisonous sketch "Buying a Monkey," "daring to expose" the "dark side" of socialism. He advocated writing a lot about "children disobeying their parents; stepmothers abusing the children of the previous wife; cadres enjoying life and becoming corrupt." He even recommended to people that there was once a "murder of a wife," which reflected the ideological contradictions of this era and was very dramatic, and could be written into a Chinese "Othello." Zhang Gan attempted to exhibit these ugly phenomena of the exploiting class as the "sharp end" of modern life on the socialist stage, using this to depict our great country as pitch black, how vicious his intentions were!

Do you want to advocate creating images of workers, peasants, and soldiers? Zhang Gan would strive to distort and change the images of workers, peasants, and soldiers into ghosts and snakes dressed in workers', peasants', and soldiers' clothes. He repeatedly followed Zhou Yang in advocating that "after Bai Maofen was raped by Huang Shiren," she should "dream of marrying Huang Shiren." He even said that this "idea" was "sympathetic," and that those who said this idea was wrong were either "very hard-hearted" or "not understanding human nature." He viciously wanted to distort the daughter of a poor peasant into a traitor to her class, dreaming of becoming a concubine of a landlord! Zhang Gan not only wanted poor peasants to surrender to landlords but also wanted revolutionary soldiers to betray at the critical moment. After watching a play that praised the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army for remaining steadfast in the face of enemy torture and the honey trap, he angrily said that this play was "sealing the hero with wax," "not moving people, making people not believe that after so many tests, there was not even a minute of wavering." Zhang Gan's advocacy of the "theory of a minute's wavering" was precisely the traitor philosophy of "a moment's hesitation" that the Chinese Khrushchev loudly advocated! Chairman Mao wrote for Comrade Liu Hulan, "Great in life, glorious in death." When we write about Liu Hulan, we should sing the praises of her lofty qualities of dedicating her life to the revolution. But Zhang Gan blatantly demanded that the playwrights write a lot about the fifteen-year-old Liu Hulan's love affairs. He wrote, "Our playwrights still do not have the courage to write like this, to cater to some feudal-minded audiences." It was truly outrageous! If we followed Zhang Gan's advocacy, our towering proletarian heroes would become extremely humble lovers; a heroic epic would turn into a bourgeois tragedy of "love and death"!

Zhang Gan's reactionary advocacy is a tactic to undermine revolutionary modern plays. If his plot succeeds, our revolutionary modern plays will degenerate and change, and our opera stage will be filled with demons dancing wildly. This is absolutely unacceptable!

The law of history is irresistible. The Peking Opera revolution, under the brilliant guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, is advancing victoriously against the wind and waves. Zhang Gan and his ilk's curses on the Peking Opera revolution are nothing but the buzzing of a few flies hitting the wall! Today, revolutionary cultural warriors and hundreds of millions of revolutionary people are at the crucial moment of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution's imminent victory, welcoming new battles on the cultural front, and striving for new victories!

    张庚是革命现代戏的死敌
    江战兵
    毛泽东思想的无比光辉照亮了京剧革命的康庄大道。江青同志亲自培育的八个革命样板戏和钢琴伴唱《红灯记》的诞生，使封建主义、资本主义、修正主义群魔乱舞的旧戏舞台改换了面貌，为人类历史上前所未有的群星灿烂的无产阶级革命文艺开创了新纪元。
    四年前，江青同志高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，率领一批革命文艺战士，向旧京剧这个顽固堡垒发动了猛烈的进攻，在文艺战线上进行了一场惊心动魄的阶级斗争。正如我们伟大的导师毛主席所指出的：“在人类历史上，凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的”。中国赫鲁晓夫及其帮凶们，预感到自己将要灭亡的命运，对这场伟大的京剧革命，恨得要死，怕得要命，千方百计地进行抵制和破坏。在这一小撮群丑的表演中，中国赫鲁晓夫在戏曲界的代理人张庚，充当了一名十分凶恶的打手。他和文艺黑线的总头目周扬一伙勾结在一起，施展出种种卑鄙的伎俩，反对江青同志。他们或者凶相毕露地妄图扼杀这场革命，或者打着“红旗”反红旗，装出一副“拥护”京剧革命的样子，暗中却阉割革命样板戏的灵魂，甚至赤膊上阵，炮制反革命的现代戏，来和江青同志精心培育的革命样板戏分庭抗礼。
    一九六三年末，江青同志曾经指示中国戏曲研究院实验剧团移植豫剧《朝阳沟》，以京剧艺术形式，反映社会主义革命和建设。窃踞了中国戏曲研究院领导职位的张庚对江青同志一系列重要指示都严加封锁，拒不执行，却按照周扬搞“X剧”的密令，决定“这个戏允许带百分之六十到七十的豫剧味儿”，把它变成破坏京剧革命的一个“桥头堡”。于是，河北梆子、河南梆子、四川帮腔、云南花灯等，都一齐塞进了这个戏，弄成不伦不类的“X剧”，妄图以此反证京剧不能表现社会主义。江青同志识破了他们的阴谋，尖锐指出，《朝阳沟》的音乐不是步子迈大了，而是迈歪了。张庚竟歇斯底里大发作，胡说什么：“作出这种结论，是向保守派投降！”狂叫“要顶住冷风”，“决不后退”。张庚制造“X剧”，还包藏这样一个祸心，就是妄图授敌以柄，为帝、修、反诬蔑我们“毁灭京剧”提供例证。真是恶毒之至，反动透顶！
    张庚搞一个“桥头堡”还不算，又叫嚷“要杀出一条血路来！”他在周扬等人的支持下，精心炮制了一出歌颂错误路线，为中国赫鲁晓夫及彭真之流树碑立传的反党黑戏。反革命修正主义分子林默涵看了这出黑戏的彩排立即拍案叫绝：“大气磅礴！”张庚更自我标榜，说这是“京剧革新的方向”。一语泄露天机。原来张庚所谓的“方向”，就是把革命现代戏变成为中国赫鲁晓夫篡党篡军篡政制造舆论的反动工具。
    不论是用“X剧”作“桥头堡”也好，还是用反党黑戏“杀出一条血路来”也好，张庚的阴谋一个也没有得逞。于是，他又把黑手伸向革命样板戏。榜样的力量是巨大的。张庚妄想砍倒几面红旗，以达到最后破坏京剧革命的卑鄙目的。
    在《红灯记》的排演过程中，前中国京剧院的一小撮反革命修正主义分子，抵制江青同志的指示，竭力丑化英雄人物，渲染生离死别的悲惨情调，借以宣扬中国赫鲁晓夫的那套活命哲学。张庚看了暗自欢喜，背后支持。但是，江青同志经过艰苦的斗争，扭转了歪风，突出了无产阶级英雄形象，突出了革命英雄主义和革命乐观主义精神，使这个戏发生了质的飞跃。广大工农兵为之热烈欢呼，张庚却咬牙切齿，赶忙打电话给他的同伙，说这个戏“改得松散无致”，“我看了以后很泄气”，甚至恶狠狠地公开咒骂“《红灯记》不是方向！”“不过硬！”并恶毒地诅咒：“《红灯记》已经到顶，到一定的阶段就不行了！”必欲置之死地而后快。
    革命样板戏《智取威虎山》，在江青同志指导下，塑造了用毛泽东思想武装起来的英雄形象，突出了毛主席“人民战争”的光辉思想，获得了工农兵的高度赞扬。而一小撮反革命修正主义分子却恨之入骨，掀起了一场反革命围攻。有的咒骂它是“白开水”，
  “三类苗”。张庚攻击它“粗糙”，“不好”，并冷嘲热讽：“这个戏没法谈，好话都让上海说绝了！”就在这片叫嚣声中，公开攻击《智取威虎山》的、臭名昭著的大毒草《〈智取威虎山〉观后漫笔》出笼了。这是一支射向毛主席革命文艺路线的大毒箭。这支毒箭，是张庚手下的一个得力干将林涵表在林默涵一伙的唆使下射出来的。它说出了林默涵、张庚之流想说而又不敢说的话。它污蔑剧中的英雄杨子荣“拘束而沉郁”，主张把他写成“泼辣剽悍粗犷”、匪气十足的江湖客。它鼓吹要大写敌人的“狡狯和嚣张”，让反面人物压倒正面人物，让革命现代戏变成离奇怪诞、群魔乱舞的反动武侠戏。《漫笔》一出笼，立即受到了江青同志的有力反击。江青同志严厉质问张庚一伙：“是坐在正面人物一边，还是坐在反面人物一边？听说还有人反对写正面人物，这是不对的。”当江青同志追问这株毒草的炮制出笼过程时，张庚公然欺骗江青同志，死保旧中宣部阎王殿，妄图顽抗到底！
    大肆宣扬反动的“补不足”论，极力歪曲和贬低京剧革命划时代的伟大历史意义，是张庚破坏京剧革命又一招毒辣的鬼蜮伎俩。一九六四年京剧现代戏观摩演出大会召开前夕，反革命修正主义分子夏衍亲自写信，让张庚加工炮制一篇《光明日报》社论。张庚跟着夏衍所谓“今天提倡京剧演现代戏，就是要弥补它的不足”之类的谰言，胡诌什么“传统戏与现代戏不是对立的”，“演了现代戏，反过来可以把传统戏演得更好”等等，猖獗地为帝王将相、才子佳人的亡灵招魂，妄图扭转京剧革命前进的巨轮，充分暴露了他那反革命的狼子野心。
    尤其令人不能容忍的是，张庚在一篇发往国外的文章中，却公然颠倒黑白，无耻地吹捧中国赫鲁晓夫对京剧革命很“重视”，“百忙中还抽暇观看”演出，胡说什么“这大大鼓舞了京剧艺术家们”，使他们“充满了必胜的信心”。
    张庚在京剧革命的伟大胜利面前，已经碰得头破血流，然而还贼心不死，继续散布对京剧革命的怀疑论调，为帝王将相、才子佳人的卷土重来制造舆论。到一九六五年底，他故技重施，又一次危言耸听地提出：“京剧演现代戏，剧团还能不能活下去？”并派人四出“调查”：“京剧演革命现代戏以后，形势到底如何？是乐观的估计，还是悲观的估计？”“是无可挽回，还是有许多事情没有办好？”妄图搜集黑材料，准备子弹，对京剧革命实行反攻倒算！
    张庚反对革命现代戏不是从京剧革命开始的，他的反革命“理论”由来已久。这个一贯“坐在反面人物一边”的老反革命，长期以来，紧步中国赫鲁晓夫的后尘，利用他窃踞的戏曲理论阵地，到处写文章，做报告，发议论，以“学术研究”为幌子大放厥辞，恶毒攻击和歪曲毛主席“百花齐放、推陈出新”的戏曲革命方针，为资本主义反革命复辟大造舆论。
    在全国解放初期，当革命现代戏的幼苗刚刚冒芽的时候，中国赫鲁晓夫就叫嚣：“反映现代生活不能勉强”，“不要‘硬生孩子’”。张庚立即学着主子的腔调，说什么，以为演现代戏“才算为人民服务”，“那他一定想得太天真了”。当有人指出，戏曲只有表现社会主义革命和建设，才能更好地为无产阶级政治服务的时候，张庚竟破口大骂：“这种‘理论’很幼稚，但非常普遍，势力也很大，所以不能不在此加以驳斥。”他摆出一副“权威”的架势，挥舞赵太爷“不准革命”的大棒，对新生的幼苗横加摧残。张庚还按照中国赫鲁晓夫的多演旧戏，“大家有饭吃，天下太平”的谬论，恶毒地捏造说，演现代戏的结果是“艺人吃不上饭”。主子和奴才一唱一和，千方百计地要把革命现代戏扼杀在摇篮里。
    当张庚看到群众热烈欢迎革命现代戏的时候，他又假装关心革命现代戏的样子，耍弄起另一套偷天换日的手法，抽去革命现代戏的灵魂，妄图把它引到反革命的邪路上去。
    你要反映社会主义生活吗？张庚就要作者们向毒草相声《买猴》学习，“敢于揭露”社会主义的“阴暗面”。他鼓吹要大写“儿女不孝顺父母；后妻虐待前房子女；干部贪图享受而腐化堕落”。他甚至向人们推荐说：曾经有过一个“谋杀妻子的事情，既反映了这个时代的思想矛盾，又是很有戏剧性的题材，满可以写成一个中国的《奥赛罗》。”张庚妄图把这类剥削阶级的丑恶现象，当作“现代生活的尖端”展览在社会主义舞台上，借此把我们伟大的国家描绘得漆黑一团，用心何其毒也！
    你要提倡塑造工农兵英雄形象吗？张庚就竭力把工农兵英雄形象，歪曲篡改成为穿着工农兵服装的牛鬼蛇神。他一再跟着周扬学舌，主张“白毛女被黄世仁强奸后”应该“幻想嫁给黄世仁”。他甚至还说，“这种想法”是“值得同情”的，“说这种想法不对的人，不是十分硬心肠的，就是不通人情的”。他恶毒地要把贫农的女儿，歪曲成为背叛本阶级、幻想当地主小老婆的无耻之徒！张庚不仅要贫农投降地主，还要革命战士临危变节。他看了歌颂解放军战士在敌人的严刑拷打和美人计面前坚贞不屈的一出戏以后，竟愤愤地说：这个戏是“用蜡把英雄封起来”的，“不感动人，使人不相信经过那么多考验，但连一分钟动摇也没有。”张庚鼓吹的“一分钟动摇”论，正是中国赫鲁晓夫大肆宣扬的“一念之差”的叛徒哲学！毛主席为刘胡兰同志题词：“生的伟大，死的光荣”。我们写刘胡兰，就是要歌颂她一心为革命的崇高品质。而张庚却公然要求剧作者大书特书十五岁的刘胡兰如何恋爱。他写道：“我们的剧作者还没有勇气这样去写，为了迁就某些封建头脑的观众。”真是混账透顶！依了张庚的主张，我们顶天立地的无产阶级英雄就会变成极端卑微的恋爱至上主义者；一曲英雄的壮烈颂歌就会变成资产阶级“爱与死”的悲剧！
    张庚的这一套反动主张，是破坏革命现代戏的一种挖心战术。他的阴谋一旦得逞，我们的革命现代戏，就会蜕化变质，我们的戏曲舞台就会出现群魔乱舞的局面。这是绝对不能容许的！
    历史的规律是不可抗拒的，京剧革命在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，乘风破浪胜利前进。张庚之流对京剧革命的诅咒，不过是几只碰壁苍蝇的嗡嗡叫而已！今天，广大革命文艺战士和亿万革命人民正在无产阶级文化大革命即将取得全面胜利的关键时刻，迎接文艺战线上的新的战斗，争取新的胜利！
