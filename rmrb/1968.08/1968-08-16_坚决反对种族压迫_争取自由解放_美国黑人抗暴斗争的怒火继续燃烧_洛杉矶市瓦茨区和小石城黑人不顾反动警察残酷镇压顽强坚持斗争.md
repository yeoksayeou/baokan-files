The flames of the American black people's struggle against violence to oppose racial oppression and fight for freedom and liberation continue to burn in a series of major cities in the United States, dealing frequent blows to the reactionary ruling clique of the United States.

On August 6, black residents of Chicago, who had previously engaged in a fierce gun battle that injured six fascist police officers, launched another struggle against violence in the Chicago suburb of Cicero on August 11. This struggle had lasted for three nights by August 13. On the night of August 13, incidents of black people throwing stones at police and using homemade Molotov cocktails to set fire to white supremacist shops continued in Cicero.

The black people's struggle against violence in Cicero, along with many anti-Vietnam War groups in the United States, decided to hold large-scale demonstrations against the Vietnam War during the Democratic National Convention to be held in Chicago at the end of the month. This has made the reactionary ruling clique of the United States tremble with fear, and they are preparing to further suppress potential anti-war demonstrations and the just struggles of black people. This exposes the weakness of the American reactionary ruling clique.

While black people in Chicago continue their struggle, on August 14, multiple black people's struggles against violence of varying scales broke out in Kansas City, Missouri, and Louisville, Kentucky. In Kansas City, black people threw more than a dozen homemade Molotov cocktails at white supremacist shops. In Louisville, black people smashed a pawn shop that exploits black people. Some black people also fired shots at police from a truck.

The black people of Los Angeles' Watts district, who have a glorious tradition of struggle, and the black people of Little Rock, Arkansas, continue to fight tenaciously despite the brutal suppression by reactionary police. After black people in Watts launched a large-scale struggle against violence on August 11, the reactionary authorities, treating it as a major threat, dispatched a large number of police for suppression. However, the flames of the black people's just struggle cannot be extinguished by reactionary forces. The American news agency admits that despite "police patrols reaching saturation levels," black people continue to strike back at reactionary police and burn white supremacist houses using homemade Molotov cocktails. After a fierce battle with reactionary police on August 9, angry black people in Little Rock continued to burn white supremacist shops with homemade Molotov cocktails and shoot at police patrol cars.

    坚决反对种族压迫  争取自由解放
    美国黑人抗暴斗争的怒火继续燃烧
    洛杉矶市瓦茨区和小石城黑人不顾反动警察残酷镇压顽强坚持斗争
    新华社十五日讯　华盛顿消息：美国黑人群众为反对种族压迫、争取自由解放的抗暴斗争的怒火，正在美国的一系列大城市继续燃烧，给了美国反动统治集团以日益频繁的打击。
    本月六日曾在一场激烈的枪战中打伤了六名法西斯警察的芝加哥的黑人群众，十一日又在芝加哥郊区芝加哥山掀起了一场抗暴斗争。这场斗争到十三日晚为止已经坚持了三个夜晚。十三日晚上在芝加哥山不断发生黑人用石块袭击警察和用自制燃烧瓶放火焚烧白人种族主义者的商店的事件。
    芝加哥山黑人的抗暴斗争，以及美国许多反对侵越战争的团体，决定在美国垄断资产阶级政党民主党将于本月底在芝加哥山举行全国代表大会期间，在芝加哥举行大规模的反对侵越战争的示威斗争，使得美国反动统治集团胆战心惊，他们正在准备进一步镇压可能发生的反战示威和黑人的正义斗争。这恰好暴露了美国反动统治集团虚弱的本质。
    在芝加哥黑人坚持斗争的同时，十四日在密苏里州的堪萨斯城和肯塔基州的路易斯维尔又爆发了多起规模不等的黑人抗暴斗争。在堪萨斯城，黑人群众向白人种族主义者的商店扔了十几个自制燃烧瓶。在路易斯维尔，黑人群众砸了一家盘剥黑人的当铺。一些黑人还从卡车上向警察开枪。
    富有光荣斗争传统的洛杉矶市瓦茨区和阿肯色州小石城的黑人群众，不顾反动警察的残酷镇压，仍在顽强地坚持斗争。在瓦茨区黑人群众十一日掀起了一场大规模的抗暴斗争后，反动当局如临大敌，派出大批警察进行镇压。但是，黑人正义斗争的火焰是反动势力所扑灭不了的。美国通讯社承认，尽管“警察巡逻达到饱和程度”，黑人群众仍然用自制燃烧瓶等继续打击反动警察和焚烧白人种族主义者的房屋。小石城的黑人继九日同反动警察进行了一场激烈的搏斗之后，连日来愤怒的黑人继续用自制燃烧瓶焚烧白人种族主义者的商店，并且用枪射击警察的巡逻车。
