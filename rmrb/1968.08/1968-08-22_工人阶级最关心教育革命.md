To the Editor:

Great Leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "The working class is the leading class." During our support-to-the-left process at Lushun City's Twenty-Fourth Middle School, we deeply felt that this is a great truth.

For a period, a handful of class enemies in our supported school used a portion of students' bourgeois factionalism to stir up trouble, causing the two factions to oppose each other, seriously obstructing the revolutionary great alliance and the school's resumption of classes for revolution. Some old coal miners heard that the school was constantly fighting "internal wars" and couldn't unite, so they brought their children to the school, personally explaining the latest directives to the students, telling them about the past class bitterness and national hatred, and organizing the students to study Chairman Mao's teachings. This greatly raised the revolutionary teachers and students' ideological awareness. The entire school quickly achieved revolutionary great alliance, established a revolutionary committee, and foiled a handful of class enemies' sabotage plots.

"The people's joyous day is the day of misery for the counter-revolutionaries." Once the revolutionary committee was established, a handful of class enemies, seeing their doom approaching, tried every means to sabotage. They used small favors to deceive a student into writing a big-character poster attacking the revolutionary government. This student's father, upon learning of his son's actions, immediately held a Mao Zedong Thought study class at home, telling his son about the past hardships of the miners. Through study, the student raised his class consciousness and voluntarily exposed the counter-revolutionary crimes of the class enemies. This incident severely struck a handful of class enemies and greatly raised the revolutionary teachers and students' class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness.

In the process of resuming classes for revolution, the revolutionary teachers and students severely criticized the revisionist educational line, inviting the workers most loyal to Chairman Mao to the podium to speak about the invincible power of Mao Zedong Thought and the absolute correctness of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We also went to the factories with the revolutionary students, learning from the workers and studying the excellent qualities of the working class.

Through practice, we deeply felt: The working class is most loyal to Chairman Mao, has the firmest stance, and the clearest love and hate. It is the leading class in all work. We must learn from the working class, humbly learn from the working class, to do a good job in the education revolution, to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

### 工人阶级最关心教育革命

    工人阶级最关心教育革命编辑同志：
    伟大领袖毛主席最近深刻指出：“工人阶级是领导阶级”。我们在抚顺市二十四中支左过程中，深深地体会到这是伟大的真理。
    有一个时期，在我们支左的学校里，一小撮阶级敌人利用一部分学生头脑里的资产阶级派性，进行挑拨离间，造成两派群众对立，严重阻碍了革命大联合和学校复课闹革命。有的老煤矿工人听说学校里老打“内战”，联合不起来，就领着自己的儿女到学校来，亲自向学生宣传最新指示，向学生讲过去的阶级苦、民族恨，又组织学生们学习毛主席的教导。这样做，大大提高了革命师生的思想觉悟。全校很快实现了革命大联合，成立了革命委员会，粉碎了一小撮阶级敌人的破坏阴谋。
    “人民大众开心之日，就是反革命分子难受之时。”革命委员会成立了，一小撮阶级敌人眼看自己末日来临，又千方百计进行破坏。他们利用小恩小惠，蒙蔽一个学生去写攻击革命政权的大字报。这个学生的父亲知道儿子干了这样的事，立即在家里办起了毛泽东思想学习班，向儿子讲述过去矿工的苦难家史。通过学习，这个学生提高了阶级觉悟，主动起来揭发阶级敌人的反革命罪行。这件事狠狠地打击了一小撮阶级敌人，大大提高了革命师生的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。
    在复课闹革命中，革命师生狠批修正主义教育路线，把最忠于毛主席的工人请上讲台，大讲战无不胜的毛泽东思想的无比威力，大讲毛主席革命路线的无比正确。我们又和革命学生一起到工厂，拜工人为老师，学习工人阶级的优秀品质。
    我们在实践中深深体会到：工人阶级最忠于毛主席，立场最坚定，爱憎最分明，是一切工作的领导阶级。我们只有拜工人阶级为老师，虚心向工人阶级学习，才能搞好教育革命，才能把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
