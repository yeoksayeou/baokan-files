The vast ocean sails with the helmsman’s guidance,
Revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought.
The educational revolution begins anew.

The sun shines brightly over the east,
The land of our motherland is fragrant with flowers.
Mao Zedong’s latest instructions spread across the nation,
The educational revolution begins anew.

“To achieve the proletarian educational revolution,
It must be led by the working class,
It must involve the participation of the working masses…”
The latest instructions spread joy among the masses.
The story of Old Wang from the foundry,
His joy was boundless, his mouth couldn’t close.
Look at him, after work, he holds the latest instructions,
Reading them carefully, each word and sentence warms his heart.
Like seedlings after rain, like sunflowers facing the sun.
He thought of the old educational system,
His emotions surged like waves.
Khrushchev of China is so despicable,
His mind is full of bourgeois stinky thoughts.
He attempts to lead the youth astray,
Dreaming of a capitalist restoration in a yellow dream.
Pfft! It’s like plucking stars from the sky, impossible,
Like a rooster laying eggs, no hope.
Old Wang thought more and more angrily,
His teeth clenched tightly.
Look! He didn’t even change his greasy clothes,
He completely forgot about going home!
He said, “If I could read a few more characters,
I would go to the school and smash the old system to pieces!”

“Right! We’ll send you to the school to contribute to the educational revolution.”
“Eh!” Old Wang turned his head to look carefully,
The workshop revolutionary committee chairman, Old Li, stood by his side.
Old Wang was about to ask when Old Li spoke up first:
“Old Wang! Mao Zedong’s latest instructions have come down,
They are the greatest encouragement and hope for us workers.”
“Yes, every word hits the mark,
We will definitely follow without a second thought.”
“Right! According to Mao Zedong’s mobilization order,
We workers must contribute to the educational revolution.
It is decided to send you and a group of comrades to Dongfanghong School,
To shoulder the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation.”

“Me?” Old Wang was stunned upon hearing this,
He punched Old Li’s shoulder.

(White) “Old Li, don’t joke around!”

“You don’t know I’m just an uneducated worker,
I can’t take on this task.”
Old Li raised Mao Zedong’s latest instructions high,
His emotions surged as he said, “Old Wang! These golden words are shining,
They are Mao Zedong guiding us.
Mao Zedong instructs us to follow,
We workers must keep up.
This concerns the revolution of our descendants not changing color,
It concerns the iron-clad country lasting for generations,
It concerns the great cause of world revolution,
It concerns…”

Old Wang listened more and more excitedly,
He waved his hand and said, “I’ll go to the school tomorrow.
Mao Zedong waves his hand, I march forward,
I dare to brave the knife mountain and fire sea.”

Old Wang’s thoughts surged with energy,
Old Li’s heart was filled with joy.
They talked heart to heart until midnight,
Planning the first battle in the school.
The next day, Old Wang got up before dawn,
He brought “Quotations from Chairman Mao” and the latest instructions with him.
He read while walking, the streets were bright red.
On one side of the wall, it was written: Warmly welcome Mao Zedong’s latest instructions!
On the other side of the wall, it was pasted: Mao Zedong’s latest instructions, one big sheet.
Old Wang walked and read, feeling very excited,
Suddenly, he saw a large group of students and teachers coming towards him.
He hadn’t figured out what was happening,
But they had already surrounded him!

It turned out that the teachers and students of Dongfanghong School,
Had heard the news and came out early to welcome him,
Their excited hearts need not be mentioned!

At this moment, seeing Old Wang coming,
They all rushed forward to surround him.
The teacher said, “Old Wang, it is Mao Zedong’s latest instructions that blow you into our school.
Welcome you to join us in the struggle, criticism, and transformation,
To smash the old system and old regulations.”
The student said, “Uncle Wang! We warmly welcome you,
To bring the good traditions of the working class,
To thoroughly transform the stinky bourgeois thoughts.”
Everyone spoke excitedly, Old Wang couldn’t get a word in.
He only opened his mouth and said, “Everyone, don’t just praise,
I am still far from Mao Zedong’s teachings.”

Everyone saw Old Wang speaking,
They closed their mouths and listened to Old Wang.
Old Wang said, “Mao Zedong teaches us:
‘The working class should also continuously improve their political consciousness in struggle.’
I am responding to Mao Zedong’s call,
To fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism with everyone,
To transform old thoughts.”

Old Wang’s words had just finished,
He saw someone walking past him with a smirk,
Making a “hum hum” sneering sound,
And muttering, “Workers don’t understand education, they only cause trouble.”

That person said this and was about to leave,
The students blocked his path.
One said, “Hmph! Put away your bourgeois intellectual airs!
Your thoughts are dirtier than manure.”
Another said, “The working class is the leading class,
Their hearts are the reddest, their eyes the brightest,
You only understand bourgeois fake ‘scholarship’,
You are the one who is completely ignorant!”

The students spoke one after another,
Criticizing him until he couldn’t open his mouth.
Old Wang saw the situation and walked over,
Speaking to that person, “In the past, you gave the green light to the bourgeoisie,
Leading the students astray,
Today, the working class leads the students forward,
The future is bright and broad.
If your thoughts are not transformed,
You will surely be thrown into the garbage bin of history.”

The students heard this and their spirits soared,
Everyone praised Old Wang.
That person saw the situation was not good and hurried away,
The students laughed and pointed at his back.
Old Wang saw this and thought in his heart,
This is the unusual class struggle.
The working class will definitely be victorious,
Firmly grasping the revolutionary power.
Old Wang thought and walked forward,
The revolutionary teachers and students followed closely,
Discussing how to do a good job in the school’s struggle, criticism, and transformation,
How to fight and win against the enemy.

This is: Old Wang enters the school, a small segment,
Next time, listen to: Dongfanghong School shows a new scene.

    大海航行靠舵手　干革命靠毛泽东思想
    教育革命谱新章（山东快书）
    红勤兵阳光灿烂照东方，祖国大地百花香，毛主席最新指示天下传，教育革命谱新章。
  “实现无产阶级教育革命，必须有工人
  阶级领导，必须有工人群众参加……”最新指示一传开，亿万军民喜洋洋。话说铸造车间的大老王，高兴得嘴都合不上。你看他，下班后手捧最新指示仔细看，字字句句暖心上。好象禾苗见雨露，又象葵花见太阳。他想到旧的教学制，心潮滚滚翻怒浪。中国赫鲁晓夫太可恨，满脑袋资产阶级臭思想。企图把青年引到邪路去，实现资本主义复辟的一枕黄粱。呸！这是上天摘星捞不着，公鸡下蛋没指望。老王越想越气愤，牙齿咬得咯咯响，看！他油腻的衣服顾不得换，把回家的事儿全忘光（啦）！只听他说：“我要是能识一些字，非得到学校，把旧学制砸个净净光！”“对！就派你到学校去，为教育革命添力量。”“呀！”老王扭头仔细看，车间革委会主任老李站在他身旁。老王正要开口问，老李连忙开了腔：“老王！毛主席最新指示传下来，给咱工人阶级最大的鞭策和期望。”“是啊，句句说到咱心窝，咱坚决照办不把二话讲。”“对！根据毛主席的动员令，咱工人要为教育革命献力量。决定派你和一批同志到东方红学校，把学校斗、批、改任务担肩上。”“派我？”老王一听直发愣，一拳头落在老李肩膀上。
  （白）“老李，别逗啦！”
  “你不知道我是大老粗，这任务咱可不能担当。”老李把毛主席最新指示高举起，心情激动得叫：“老王！这金光大字耀眼明，是毛主席给咱指方向。毛主席指示我照办，咱工人阶级可要紧跟上。这关系到子孙革命不变色，关系到铁打江山万代长，关系到世界革命事不小，关系到……”老王越听越激动，大手一挥说：“我明天就到学校走一
  趟。毛主席挥手我前进，刀山火海我敢闯。”老王思想一通劲头大，老李不觉心里喜洋洋。和老王促膝谈心到半夜，商量进学校先打第一仗。第二天，老王天还不亮就起床，把《毛主席语录》和最新指示带身上。一边走路一边看，满街满巷红堂堂。这边墙上写的是：热烈欢呼毛主席最新指示发下来！那边墙上贴的是：毛主席最新指示一大张。老王走着看着正带劲，忽见前面涌来学生教师一大帮。他还没弄清咋回事儿，人家可把他紧围上（啦）！原来东方红学校师生听到这消息，大早起来迎亲人，激动的心儿就甭讲
      （啦）！这时一见老王走过来，都争先恐后紧围上。教师说：“老王啊，是毛主席最新指示的春风，把你吹进了俺学校。欢迎你和我们一齐投入斗、批、改，砸碎旧学制和旧规章。”学生说：“王大叔！我们热烈欢迎你，带来工人阶级好传统，彻底改造资产阶级的臭思想。”大家七嘴八舌讲的真带劲，老王一句话也插不上。只是放开嗓门说：“大家不要净表扬，离毛主席教导还差千万丈呢！”大家见老王说了话，嗓门紧闭都听老王讲。老王说：“毛主席教导我们：‘工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自
  己的政治觉悟。’我是响应毛主席的号召，和大家一块斗私批修改造旧思想。”老王话儿刚说完，见一人嘻皮笑脸走过他身旁。发出“嗯嗯”奸笑声，还低声嘟囔：“工人不懂教育净来帮倒
  忙。”那个人说罢正要走，学生们上前把路挡。这个说：“哼！收起你资产阶级知识分子
  的臭架子吧！你的思想比那大粪还要脏。”那个说：“工人阶级是领导阶级，心最红来眼最亮，你只懂资产阶级假‘学问’，你才是一窍不通的擀
  面杖！”学生们你一言来我一
  语，批得他低头口难
  张。老王见势走过去，对着那人把话讲：“过去，你给资产阶
  级开绿灯，把学生引到邪路上，今天，工人阶级领导学生向前进，前途光明宽又广。你们的思想不改造，必然会被扔进历史的垃圾箱。”同学们一听心振奋，个个都夸大老王。那人见势不妙忙溜走，同学们嘲笑着指他后脊梁。老王看到此情心里想，这就是阶级斗争不寻常。工人阶级一定会胜利，把革命政权牢牢掌。老王想着往前走，革命师生紧跟上，商量怎样搞好学校的斗批改，怎样和敌人交锋打胜仗。这就是：大老王入学校一小段，下次再听：东方红学校出现一片新气象。
