Pakistani newspapers have recently published editorials on the successful visit of Pakistani Foreign Minister Agha Muhammad Shah to China, enthusiastically welcoming the continuous development of friendship between the peoples of China and Pakistan.

The Karachi-based Dawn newspaper published an editorial on August 11 stating that the friendship between China and Pakistan has been firmly established and is directly related to peace and stability in the region.

The editorial pointed out that in the context of India's aggressive military buildup and threats against Pakistan, the Chinese leadership's reaffirmation of support for the Pakistani people's struggle to maintain national independence and resist foreign aggression and intervention, as well as China's support for the Kashmiri people's struggle for self-determination, is of great significance.

The editorial further stated that China's stance "is not only one of the most reliable guarantees for peace and progress in this region, but also one of the most reliable guarantees for world peace."

The editorial of the Dacca Morning News in East Pakistan said, "The friendship between China and Pakistan is undoubtedly a bastion of Asian and African resistance against various forms of imperialism."

The editorial stated that Pakistan will never forget the assistance China provided during our struggle to maintain our hard-won freedom.

The editorial of the Pakistan Times on August 12 stated that the friendship and unity between Pakistan and China will be a guarantee for peace in Asia. At a time when India is escalating military provocations on the Chinese border and becoming increasingly hostile towards Pakistan, the unity between Pakistan and China will have particularly significant implications for the struggle against their common enemies.

Pakistani newspapers continued to comment on the successful visit of Pakistani Foreign Minister Agha Muhammad Shah to China, enthusiastically welcoming the strengthening of friendship between the peoples of China and Pakistan.

The editorial of the Pakistan Times on August 13 stated that China's reaffirmation of support for Pakistan's struggle to maintain national independence and resist aggression, and support for the Kashmiri people's struggle for national self-determination, as well as the declaration by Chinese leaders that the 700 million Chinese people, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will forever be reliable friends of the Pakistani people, are all noble statements. They demonstrate the continuous development of the Sino-Pakistani friendship, which is in the fundamental interests of the peoples of both countries.

The editorial of the Daily News in Karachi on August 12 stated that Sino-Pakistani friendship is a force in this region that stops aggression and expansionism, and is a bastion of peace.

The editorial stated that when the Indian government's massive military buildup is threatening the peace and security of neighboring countries, all peace-loving countries in this region must unite to face this challenge.
