To the Most Respected and Beloved Great Leader Chairman Mao:

The 17 million military and civilian personnel on the Fujian frontline, filled with the passion of victory, report to you, our most red sun in our hearts, a piece of heart-stirring news: Under your warm care and in the midst of the triumphant songs of the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary committees of Fujian Province and Fuzhou City have been gloriously born!

Today, Fujian's mountains and rivers are exceptionally magnificent! From the foot of Wuyi Mountain to the frontline of coastal defense, from the forests of northern Fujian to the banks of the Jiulong River, the people of Fujian, who are infinitely loyal to you, hold the revolutionary classics, look towards Beijing, and repeatedly shout your brilliant thoughts have achieved another great victory! They repeatedly sing that your proletarian revolutionary line has another triumphant song that echoes through the clouds! In countless words and songs, a most beautiful wish is condensed: We sincerely wish you eternal life! Eternal life!

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! On this day of great joy and celebration, the military and civilian personnel on the Fujian frontline miss you dearly!

It is you who led the Red Army, with the red flag leaping over Tingjiang, straight down to Longyan and Hangzhou, igniting the flames of revolutionary armed struggle in Fujian, establishing the revolutionary base in western Fujian, and bringing light and hope to the people of Fujian who were suffering from deep calamities.

It is you who personally wrote the brilliant Guangtong Conference Resolution, setting a great blueprint for the construction of our party and army.

It is you who led the Chinese people to defeat the Japanese invaders, drive away the American wolves, and bury the Chiang Kai-shek regime, liberating the laboring people.

It is you who personally led us in the great struggle of socialist revolution and socialist construction, bringing about tremendous revolutionary changes in Fujian Province. Under your guidance, the revolutionary people of Fujian Province hoist the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and march forward bravely on the broad road of socialism!

It is you who, with the outstanding talent of a great proletarian commander, led us in a victorious struggle against the enemy in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu. The cannons shook Kinmen, and the noose strangled the American imperialists. This greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary people, crushed the arrogance of the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries, defended the security of our socialist motherland, and supported the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world!

Respected Chairman Mao! With the highest Marxist-Leninist wisdom of our time, you have summarized the historical experience of the dictatorship of the proletariat and most profoundly elucidated the laws of class struggle in the historical period of socialism. With the heroic spirit and courage of the greatest proletarian revolutionary, you ignited the first proletarian cultural revolution in human history, opening a new era for the communist movement.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! The proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad revolutionary masses of Fujian, who are infinitely loyal to you, under the guidance of your revolutionary line and the battle cry of "Fire at the Headquarters," hoist the great banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against the reactionaries." We launched a fierce attack on China's Khrushchev and his agents in Fujian, Ye Fei, Fan Shiren, and Hou Zhenya, a small handful of unrepentant capitalist-roaders, traitors, and spies. Over the past two years, at every critical moment of the struggle, it was you and the proletarian headquarters led by you and Vice Chairman Lin who pointed out the direction for us to advance, gave us powerful weapons, and helped us defeat the frenzied counterattacks of the class enemies, making them fall into disarray and collapse completely, smashing their plot to restore capitalism, and achieving decisive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Respected Chairman Mao! The People's Liberation Army stationed on the Fujian frontline, personally created and led by you, and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin, resolutely responded to your great call to "support the broad leftist masses." In defending the country, defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and in the "three supports and two militaries" work, they have established great merits. They breathe with the proletarian revolutionary factions, share their destiny; they are the most active and enthusiastic in propagating your brilliant thoughts; they are the bravest and most steadfast in defending your revolutionary line. The heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army is indeed a strong backbone for the proletarian revolutionary factions, a firm pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and a steel wall for our great motherland!

The ship sails with the helmsman, and the revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! The heavens and the earth are not as great as your kindness. Parents are not as dear as you. Following you is the direction, following you is happiness, following you is light, following you is victory!

We, the military and civilian personnel on the Fujian frontline, solemnly pledge to you with infinite loyalty:

We will definitely take Vice Chairman Lin as our shining example, forever loyal to you, forever loyal to your brilliant thoughts, forever loyal to your proletarian revolutionary line. Like the good cadre Meng Yansheng, who is infinitely loyal to your revolutionary line, we will think of you in everything, obey you in everything, and follow you in everything. We will unite more closely around the proletarian headquarters led by you and Vice Chairman Lin, unify our thoughts, steps, and actions with Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly smash the reactionary "theory of multiple centers." With "criticize revisionism and repudiate self" as the key, we will establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes, further raise our consciousness of class struggle and line struggle, promote the revolutionary transformation of people's thinking, and turn Fujian Province into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought!

We will definitely follow your great teachings: "You should pay attention to national affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" We will follow your great strategic deployment, fully implement your series of latest instructions, take class struggle and the struggle between the two lines as the key, carry out in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism, seriously do the work of cleaning up the class ranks, further strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, and firmly, accurately, and ruthlessly strike at a small handful of class enemies. We will criticize China's Khrushchev and his agents in Fujian deeply and thoroughly, fight them down and expose them, thoroughly eliminate the poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line they promoted, and root out the hidden traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries, the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries. We will definitely follow your instructions, quickly implement your personal instructions on the agreements of various revolutionary mass organizations in Fujian Province to strengthen and develop revolutionary great alliances, strengthen and develop the revolutionary three-in-one combination, complete the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation on all fronts, and achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

We will definitely follow your instructions to build the revolutionary committees into revolutionary, authoritative, closely linked with the masses, and vigorous battle command posts. We will make studying and applying your brilliant thoughts and your series of latest instructions our primary task. We will firmly grasp the revolutionary transformation of the leading cadres, implement streamlining and efficiency, and strengthen and develop the revolutionary committees in the class struggle.

We will definitely respond to your great call to "grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness," further sum up our efforts, strive to be the best, and build socialism quickly, efficiently, and economically. The working class of Fujian will definitely follow your latest instructions, fully play the leading role of the working class in the cultural revolution and all work, constantly improve our political consciousness, and be models in implementing your series of latest instructions.

We will definitely follow your teachings, further carry out the "support the army and love the people" and "support the government and love the people" movements, strengthen military-civilian unity, heighten our vigilance a hundredfold, and "spare no effort to annihilate the invading enemy." We vow to turn the southeastern coastal defense into an iron wall. As soon as you give the order, we will definitely plant the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought on the sacred territory of Taiwan!

Respected Chairman Mao! All rivers and streams flow into the sea, and all sunflowers turn towards the sun. The 17 million military and civilian personnel on the Fujian frontline will forever have their red hearts turned towards the red sun! Thinking of you, we are clear-sighted and firm in our stance! Thinking of you, we are confident and clear in our direction! Thinking of you, we gain strength throughout our bodies! Thinking of you, we march forward with our heads held high! Our millions of red hearts converge into a most beautiful wish: to be a revolutionary soldier who is infinitely loyal to you! We sincerely wish you, our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao, eternal life! Eternal life! Eternal life!
