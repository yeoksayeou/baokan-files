Hong Kong Anti-British Persecution Struggle Committee and Patriotic Compatriots Hold Meetings to Condemn the Fascist Atrocities of the British Authorities

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, August 16th: More than 70 units of the Hong Kong Anti-British Persecution Struggle Committee and patriotic compatriots from various sectors held meetings, issued statements, and wrote letters to patriotic newspapers on the 15th, expressing the strongest protest against the British authorities' fascist atrocity of arbitrarily revoking the registration of Chung Wah Middle School. They resolutely support the just struggle of Chung Wah Middle School and vow to give a decisive and powerful response to the new provocation by British imperialism.

The entire faculty, staff, and students of Chung Wah Middle School gathered together on the morning of the 15th, filled with indignation, to hold a rally to condemn the British authorities' fascist atrocities. They repeatedly shouted slogans at the meeting: "Protest against the British authorities' unjust revocation of our school's registration!" "Defend Mao Zedong Thought to the death!" "Forever loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

The entire faculty, staff, and students unanimously declared: They will more widely propagate the invincible Mao Zedong Thought among the masses, closely connect with the masses, expose the enemy's fascist face, and strike the enemy more powerfully, resolutely developing the patriotic education cause.

The Hong Kong and Kowloon Patriotic Compatriots' Anti-British Persecution Struggle Committee, the Hong Kong and Kowloon Students' Anti-British Persecution Struggle Committee, and the Hong Kong and Kowloon Educational Circles' Anti-British Persecution Struggle Committee issued statements on the 15th. The statement by the Hong Kong and Kowloon Patriotic Compatriots' Anti-British Persecution Struggle Committee pointed out: The British authorities' persecution of Chung Wah Middle School is intended to further deteriorate and tense the situation in Hong Kong, and its nature is extremely serious. This is a new example of its stubborn implementation of the reactionary policy of anti-China and persecution of Hong Kong and Kowloon patriotic compatriots, and it is another big exposure of the British authorities' malicious plot to suppress the Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots from learning and propagating Mao Zedong Thought. If the British authorities persist in their evil ways and do not immediately accept the just demands of Chung Wah Middle School, then all the serious consequences that arise from this will be entirely the responsibility of the British authorities!

On the 15th, more than 70 units of patriotic compatriots, including workers, students, bank and insurance employees, financial and commercial institutions, shop assistants, street vendors, and residents, held meetings, issued statements, and wrote letters to patriotic newspapers to express their resolute support for the just struggle of Chung Wah Middle School.

    中华中学全体师生员工，十五日早上齐集在一起，怀着无比愤怒的心情，举行声讨港英当局法西斯暴行的大会。他们在会上一次又一次地高呼：“抗议港英无理撤销我校注册！”“誓死捍卫毛泽东思想！”“永远忠于伟大领袖毛主席！”“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    全体师生员工一致表示：要更广泛地向群众宣传战无不胜的毛泽东思想，密切联系群众，揭露敌人的法西斯嘴脸，更有力地打击敌人，坚决发展爱国教育事业。
