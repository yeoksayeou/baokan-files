The revolution is thriving and production is booming. The Benxi Coal Mine is bustling with a new atmosphere. The entire mine, having completed the national plan for the first half of the year twelve days ahead of schedule, has seen production steadily increase since July.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Shenyang, August 14th: The revolutionary workers of the Benxi Coal Mine, under the guidance of the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the mine, have been diligently implementing Chairman Mao's great directive of "grasp revolution, promote production." They have been steadfast in emphasizing proletarian politics, relentlessly fighting class struggle, and ensuring it does not wane. The revolution is thriving, and production is booming. The entire mine, having completed the national plan for the first half of the year twelve days ahead of schedule, has seen production steadily increase since July. The original coal production and excavation plans for July were completed ahead of schedule. Since entering August, production has made further progress.

The "Sixteen Points" on the Cultural Revolution, personally drafted by the great leader Chairman Mao, state: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a powerful driving force for the development of social productive forces in our country." Since its establishment in April this year, the revolutionary committee of the Benxi Coal Mine has mobilized the masses to intensify class struggle, closely linking the revolutionary criticism with the work of purging class elements. Revolutionary workers have fiercely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of managing enterprises promoted by China's Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist roaders within the mine. They have launched a fierce attack on the class enemies, rooting out a handful of traitors, spies, and unrepentant landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists hidden within the revolutionary ranks. This has mobilized the socialist production enthusiasm of the broad revolutionary workers, effectively promoting production.

However, a handful of class enemies are not willing to meet their doom. When the broad revolutionary workers joyfully celebrated the mine's completion of the national production plan for the first half of the year twelve days ahead of schedule, they concocted new schemes, spreading fallacies such as "eight-hour workday is the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie," in an attempt to sabotage production. In response to this situation, the revolutionary committee and the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team held four sessions of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, seriously studying Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions. They followed the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forget class struggle," grasped the new trends and characteristics of class struggle, and organized the broad revolutionary workers to launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism. The revolutionary workers' awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines has further increased, and their production enthusiasm has soared. The entire mine has seen a new atmosphere in both revolution and production. In the First Coal Mining District, revolutionary workers encountered a residual mining face that had not been seen for many years, with a broken roof, high pressure, low mining face, and extremely difficult operations. The workers recited Chairman Mao's great teaching of "resolutely decide to overcome all difficulties, fear no sacrifice, and strive for victory" at the working face, united in overcoming difficulties, and created a new record of producing 3,000 tons of raw coal per day, a feat never before achieved in history.

　　革命轰轰烈烈  生产蒸蒸日上
　　本溪煤矿到处一片新气象
　　全矿在提前十二天完成上半年国家计划的基础上，七月以来生产节节上升
    据新华社沈阳十四日电　辽宁省本溪矿务局本溪煤矿广大革命职工，在驻矿解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，认真执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，坚持突出无产阶级政治，狠抓阶级斗争不转向，革命搞得轰轰烈烈，生产蒸蒸日上。全矿在提前十二天完成上半年国家计划的基础上，七月份又提前完成了原煤的产量计划和掘进计划。进入八月以来，生产又有新的进展。
    伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的无产阶级文化大革命的“十六条”指出：“无产阶级文化大革命是使我国社会生产力发展的一个强大的推动力。”本溪矿革委会今年四月份成立以来，放手发动群众，狠抓阶级斗争，把革命大批判和清理阶级队伍的工作紧密地结合起来。革命职工狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及本矿党内一小撮走资派推行的反革命修正主义办企业路线，主动向阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻，挖出了隐藏在革命队伍中的一小撮叛徒、特务以及没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，调动了广大革命职工的社会主义生产积极性，有力地促进了生产。
    但是，一小撮阶级敌人并不甘心于灭亡。当广大革命职工热烈欢呼全矿提前十二天完成上半年国家生产计划的时候，他们又耍起新阴谋，散布“八小时工作是资产阶级反动路线”等谬论，妄图破坏生产。针对这种情况，矿革委会和解放军毛泽东思想宣传队先后举办四期毛泽东思想学习班，认真学习毛主席的一系列最新指示。他们遵循伟大领袖毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，掌握阶级斗争的新动向、新特点，组织广大革命职工再一次掀起革命大批判的新高潮。革命职工的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟进一步提高，生产积极性更加高涨，全矿革命和生产出现了新的气象。在第一采煤区，革命职工遇到了多年没有见到的残采工作面，顶板破碎，压力大，工作面矮，操作十分困难，工人们在掌子面齐声背诵毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的伟大教导，齐心协力战胜困难，创造了历史上从来没有过的日产原煤三千吨的新纪录。
