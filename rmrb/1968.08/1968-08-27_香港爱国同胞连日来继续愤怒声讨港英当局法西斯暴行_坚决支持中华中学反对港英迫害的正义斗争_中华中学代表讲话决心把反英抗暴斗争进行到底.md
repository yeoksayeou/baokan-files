Hong Kong patriots have continued in recent days to angrily condemn the fascist atrocities of the Hong Kong British authorities and resolutely support the just struggle of Chung Wah Middle School against British oppression. A representative of Chung Wah Middle School vowed to carry the anti-British, anti-fascist struggle through to the end.

	New China News Agency, Hong Kong, August 26 — In recent days, Hong Kong patriots have continued to angrily condemn the Hong Kong British authorities' brazen revocation of the registration of Chung Wah Middle School, resolutely supporting the just struggle of Chung Wah Middle School.

	On the afternoon of the 24th, representatives from various circles in Hong Kong and Kowloon held a rally to support Chung Wah Middle School's struggle against British oppression. Yang Guang, the chairman of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Anti-British Oppression Struggle Committee, strongly denounced the British authorities' new fascist atrocities at the meeting. He pointed out: The series of persecutions that the Hong Kong British authorities have carried out against Chung Wah Middle School are not accidental. They are a continuation of the British authorities' long-standing interference and restrictions on our patriotic affairs in Hong Kong and Kowloon, and another manifestation of their plot to obstruct and suppress the spread of the great Mao Zedong Thought. Their actions will only backfire, exposing their fascist face to the people of China and the world, further inciting indignation and opposition. The debt the British authorities owe will definitely be repaid.

	The representative of Chung Wah Middle School angrily denounced the various persecutions the British authorities have inflicted on the school and reported on the school's determined struggle against the British authorities.

	He said, the just struggle of Chung Wah Middle School is not isolated. The people of the motherland support us, and the patriots of various circles in Hong Kong and Kowloon support us. We are full of confidence and will definitely achieve victory in the struggle, vowing to carry the anti-British, anti-fascist struggle through to the end.

	In the past ten days, representatives of teachers, students, parents, alumni, and student representatives from Hong Kong and Kowloon have gone to the "Governor's Office" and the "Education Department" of the British authorities four times to strongly protest against the fascist atrocities of the British authorities. Recently, teachers and students from patriotic schools in Hong Kong and Kowloon, workers from various industries, employees of patriotic organizations, the publishing and printing industry, the business community, and patriots from the "New Territories" have also held meetings and issued statements, angrily condemning the British authorities' persecution of Chung Wah Middle School.

	All patriots illegally detained in concentration camps by the British authorities also strongly protested to the relevant British authorities on the morning of the 15th after learning of the British authorities' brazen decision to revoke the registration of Chung Wah Middle School.

	The Support Committee for the Struggle Against British Oppression by Various Circles in Macau and the Macau Federation of Chinese Students and the Macau Chinese Education Association recently issued statements, strongly protesting against the fascist atrocities of the British authorities and resolutely supporting the just struggle of Chung Wah Middle School against British oppression.

	Due to the determined struggle of all patriotic teachers, students, and staff of Chung Wah Middle School and the patriots of Hong Kong and Kowloon, the British authorities were forced to lift the seal on the Chung Wah Middle School premises on the 16th and hand over the keys to the school gates to the school representatives. However, the British authorities still insist on executing the reactionary order to cancel the registration of Chung Wah Middle School.

	After the seal on the Chung Wah Middle School premises was lifted, patriots from various circles came to express their support in an unbroken stream. When they saw the extensive evidence of the vandalism and looting by the British police and special agents inside the school, they expressed extreme indignation.

    香港爱国同胞连日来继续愤怒声讨港英当局法西斯暴行
    坚决支持中华中学反对港英迫害的正义斗争
    中华中学代表讲话决心把反英抗暴斗争进行到底
    新华社香港二十六日电　香港爱国同胞连日来继续愤怒声讨港英当局悍然撤销中华中学注册的法西斯暴行，坚决支持中华中学的正义斗争。
    二十四日下午，港九各界爱国同胞代表举行了支持中华中学反对港英迫害斗争大会，港九各界同胞反对港英迫害斗争委员会主任委员杨光在会上强烈谴责港英当局的法西斯新暴行。他指出：港英当局对中华中学所进行的一系列迫害，并不是偶然的，是港英当局多年来对我港九爱国事业不断进行干涉、限制的罪恶活动的继续，是港英当局妄图阻挠、压制伟大的毛泽东思想的普及和传播的阴谋的又一表现。它这样做的结果，只能是搬起石头打自己的脚，使它的法西斯面目在中国人民和全世界人民的面前暴露无遗，更加激起人们的愤慨和反对。港英当局欠下的这笔债，是一定要偿还的。
    中华中学代表在会上愤怒控诉了港英当局对中华中学的种种迫害，报告了全校爱国师生员工同港英当局进行坚决斗争的经过。
    他说，中华中学的正义斗争不是孤立的，祖国人民支持我们，港九各界爱国同胞支持我们。我们信心百倍，一定要取得斗争的胜利，誓把反英抗暴斗争进行到底。
    最近十天来，中华中学的教师、学生、家长、校友代表和港九学生界代表，先后四次前往港英“总督府”和“教育司署”，对港英当局的法西斯暴行提出强烈抗议。港九爱国学校的师生、各业工人、爱国机构的职工、出版印刷界、工商界和“新界”地区的爱国同胞最近也分别举行集会，发表声明，愤怒声讨港英当局迫害中华中学的暴行。
    被港英当局无理拘禁在集中营的全体爱国同胞，在获悉港英当局悍然宣布撤销中华中学注册的无理决定后，也在十五日早上向港英有关当局提出了强烈的抗议。
    澳门各界同胞支援港九各界同胞反对港英迫害斗争委员会和澳门中华学生联合总会、澳门中华教育会最近也分别发表声明，强烈抗议港英当局的法西斯暴行，坚决支持中华中学反对港英迫害的正义斗争。
    由于中华中学全体爱国师生员工和港九爱国同胞的坚决斗争，港英当局不得不在十六日解除中华中学校舍的封闭，把校舍大门的钥匙交还给学校代表，但是港英当局仍坚持要执行取消中华中学注册的反动命令。
    在中华中学校舍启封后，前往慰问的各界爱国同胞络绎不绝。当他们看到校内被港英警察特务捣乱搜劫的大量罪证时，表示极为愤怒。
