New China News Agency, August 4th: Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi held a banquet this evening to welcome Pakistani Foreign Minister Asad Hussain and his wife, as well as other accompanying personnel, who are visiting China for a friendly visit.

At the banquet, filled with the atmosphere of friendship between the peoples of China and Pakistan, Vice Premier Chen Yi and Foreign Minister Asad Hussain spoke in turn, wishing for the friendship between the peoples of China and Pakistan to flourish.

In his speech, Vice Premier Chen Yi, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, extended a warm welcome to the distinguished guests from the friendly neighboring country of Pakistan. He highly praised the new developments in the friendship between the peoples of China and Pakistan. He said, in the struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism, against foreign aggression and interference, we support each other and inspire each other; in developing our respective economic construction, we exchange what we have and cooperate closely. The consolidation and development of the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Pakistan not only serve the fundamental interests of the two peoples but also make a significant contribution to the cause of unity and anti-imperialism among the peoples of Asia and Africa.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said, imperialism, modern revisionism, and expansionists are extremely hostile to Sino-Pakistani friendship and constantly attempt to sabotage it, but their plots have all ended in shameful failure. Recently, Foreign Minister Hussain reiterated in the Pakistani National Assembly that friendship with China is a major principle of Pakistan's foreign policy. This is a high evaluation of Sino-Pakistani friendship and a great trust in the Chinese government and people. The Chinese government and people also highly value the friendly and cooperative relations with Pakistan. We will unswervingly contribute our efforts to consolidating and developing Sino-Pakistani friendship.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said, under the leadership of President Ayub Khan, the Pakistani government and people have waged a resolute struggle to safeguard national sovereignty and national independence, achieving significant victories against foreign aggression and interference. The Chinese government and people firmly support the just struggle of the Pakistani government and people against foreign aggression and interference, and firmly support the just struggle of the Kashmiri people for national self-determination. Our position is consistent and unwavering.

Vice Premier Chen Yi pointed out that the current international situation continues to develop in a direction favorable to the people of the world. The Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression for national salvation has achieved tremendous victories. The just struggle of the Palestinian and Arab peoples against American and Israeli aggression is flourishing. The national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are continually growing stronger. The broad masses of people in Western Europe and North America have new awakenings. American imperialism is already at its wits' end, and the modern revisionist clique is disintegrating. Their reactionary rule at home and abroad has encountered profound crises, and their days are getting worse. The revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries will certainly achieve victory. This is the general trend of historical development, the mainstream of our era, and something that no one can stop.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said, at present, the Chinese people are, under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, striving to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. At this important moment, the visit of Foreign Minister Asad Hussain and other Pakistani guests to China is a source of encouragement and support for us. We are confident that your visit will deepen the understanding and friendship between the two peoples and will make new contributions to the cause of Sino-Pakistani friendship and cooperation.

Vice Premier Chen Yi toasted to the health of President Muhammad Ayub Khan!

In his speech, Foreign Minister Asad Hussain first expressed his heartfelt thanks to the Chinese government and people for their warm and cordial welcome. He said, this is a sincere expression of your deep and enduring friendship with Pakistan and its people, and we also cherish such friendship for you.

He said, the relations between Pakistan and China are based on the principles of mutual respect, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, mutual respect for sovereignty, and mutual cooperation, which are in the fundamental interests of the peoples of the two countries. We believe that opportunism or harming others for personal gain has no place in the policies of either Pakistan or China. On the contrary, the guiding principles of the policies of China and Pakistan are to practice good neighborliness, manifested in cooperative, friendly, and mutually beneficial relations.

Foreign Minister Asad Hussain spoke about the achievements of Pakistan under the leadership of President Muhammad Ayub Khan. He said, we want to further accelerate the pace of development. Unfortunately, the policy of one of our neighboring countries makes us concerned about our security and the maintenance of peace in this region. In our environment, we have a national duty to remain vigilant and alert when our security is threatened. When aggression is imposed on a nation, that nation has no choice but to defend itself. In 1965, we were forced to fight to defend our independence, territorial integrity, and sovereignty. We gratefully remember the strong support of your great country at that time and the very valuable assistance you have given us since then. True and loyal friendship is proven in times of difficulty. Your help at that time is a shining example of such friendship.

He said, the people of Pakistan, like the people of Jammu and Kashmir, feel your support in their struggle. In accordance with the lofty principles upheld by your great country, you have repeatedly declared your support for their just struggle. Pakistan will spare no effort to help the people of Jammu and Kashmir achieve their rightful rights. Foreign Minister Asad Hussain also said that the Pakistani government and people are deeply concerned about the suffering inflicted by a brutal war on the heroic Vietnamese people.

Foreign Minister Asad Hussain said, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have made unprecedented progress in human history in a short period. I hope to see with my own eyes the various achievements of the great Chinese people in all aspects during this visit.

Foreign Minister Asad Hussain toasted to the health and longevity of Chairman Mao Zedong!

　　陈毅副总理兼外长同侯赛因外长举行会谈
    新华社四日讯　国务院副总理兼外交部长陈毅今天晚上举行宴会，欢迎巴基斯坦外交部长阿沙德·侯赛因和夫人以及其他随行人员来我国进行友好访问。
    在洋溢着中国和巴基斯坦两国人民友谊气氛的宴会上，陈毅副总理和阿沙德·侯赛因部长先后讲话，共祝中国和巴基斯坦两国人民的友谊日益发展。
    陈毅副总理在讲话中代表中国政府和中国人民向来自友好邻邦的巴基斯坦贵宾表示热烈的欢迎，并且热烈赞扬中巴两国人民友谊的新发展。他说，在反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义、反对外来侵略和干涉的斗争中，我们互相支持，互相鼓舞；在发展各自的经济建设中，我们互通有无，密切合作。中巴友好合作关系的巩固和发展，不仅符合两国人民的根本利益，而且是对亚非人民团结反帝事业的重大贡献。
    陈毅副总理说，帝国主义、现代修正主义和扩张主义者十分仇视中巴友好，不断进行破坏，但是它们的阴谋都招致了可耻的失败。最近侯赛因外长在巴基斯坦国民议会上重申，同中国友好是巴基斯坦对外政策的一项主要原则，这是对中巴友好的崇高评价，是对中国政府和人民的巨大信任。中国政府和人民也十分珍视同巴基斯坦的友好合作关系。我们将始终不渝地为巩固和发展中巴友谊贡献自己的力量。
    陈毅副总理说，巴基斯坦政府和人民，在阿尤布·汗总统的领导下，为维护国家主权和民族独立，同外来的侵略和干涉进行了坚决的斗争，取得了重大的胜利。中国政府和人民坚决支持巴基斯坦政府和人民反对外来侵略和干涉的正义斗争，坚决支持克什米尔人民争取民族自决的正义斗争。我们这个立场是始终如一，坚定不移的。
    陈毅副总理指出，当前国际形势继续朝着有利于世界人民的方向发展。越南人民的抗美救国战争取得了巨大的胜利。巴勒斯坦和阿拉伯人民反对美、以侵略的正义斗争方兴未艾。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族解放运动不断发展壮大。西欧、北美广大人民有了新的觉醒。美帝国主义已经是穷途末路，现代修正主义集团已经是分崩离析，它们在国内外的反动统治都发生了深刻的危机，日子越来越不好过。世界各国人民的革命斗争，一定会取得胜利，这是历史发展的总趋势，是我们时代的主流，是任何人也阻挡不了的。
    陈毅副总理说，目前中国人民正在伟大领袖毛主席的领导下夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。在这个重要时刻，阿沙德·侯赛因部长和巴基斯坦其他贵宾们来中国访问，是对我们的鼓舞和支持。我们深信，你们的访问必将增进两国人民的了解和友谊，必将对中巴友好合作事业作出新的贡献。
    陈毅副总理祝穆罕默德·阿尤布·汗总统健康！
    阿沙德·侯赛因部长在讲话中首先对中国政府和人民给予他们的热情和亲切的欢迎，表示衷心的感谢。他说，这是你们对巴基斯坦及其人民的深厚和持久的友谊的真诚的表现，而我们也是全心全意地对你们怀着这样的友谊的。
    他说，巴中两国关系是建立在互相尊重、互不干涉内政、互相尊重彼此主权和互相合作的原则的基础上的，而这些是符合我们两国人民的根本利益的。我们认为，权宜主义或损人利己，不论在巴基斯坦的政策中或在中国的政策中，都没有任何地位。相反地，中国和巴基斯坦的政策的指导方针乃是实行睦邻，体现在合作、友好和互利的关系中。
    阿沙德·侯赛因部长谈到了巴基斯坦在穆罕默德·阿尤布·汗总统的领导下所取得的成就。他说，我们想进一步加快发展的速度。可是，很不幸，我们的某一个邻国的政策使我们对自己的安全和在这一区域维护和平感到忧虑。在我们所处的环境中，我们有一种民族的义务，在我们的安全受到威胁的面前，保持戒备和警惕。当把侵略强加在一个民族身上的时候，这个民族没有别的选择，只有进行自卫。在一九六五年，我们被迫为保卫我们的独立、领土完整和主权而战斗。我们怀着感激的心情记着你们伟大的国家在那个时候给我们的强大的支援，还有从那时以来所给我们的非常有价值的援助。真诚和忠实的友谊是在困难时刻得到证明的。你们在那个时候的帮助就是这种友谊的一个光辉的范例。
    他说，巴基斯坦人民，与查谟和克什米尔人民一样，在斗争中都感到你们的支持。按照你们伟大国家所坚持的崇高的原则，你们曾多次宣布支持他们的正义斗争。巴基斯坦将不遗余力地帮助查谟和克什米尔人民取得他们应有的正当权利。阿沙德·侯赛因部长还说，巴基斯坦政府和人民，对于一场残酷的战争正在强加给英雄的越南人民的苦难，表示极大的关切。
    阿沙德·侯赛因部长说，在你们的伟大领袖毛泽东主席的英明指引下，中国人民在短时间内已取得了人类历史上罕见的进步。我希望这次能亲眼看到伟大的中国人民在各方面所取得的各种成就。
    阿沙德·侯赛因部长祝毛泽东主席健康、万寿无疆！
