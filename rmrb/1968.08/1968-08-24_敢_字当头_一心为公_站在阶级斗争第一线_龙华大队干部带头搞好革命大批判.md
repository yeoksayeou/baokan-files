The revolutionary cadres of Longhua Brigade in Guangdong Province's Boluo County, under the enthusiastic assistance of a propaganda team from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, have followed the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, "The vanguard and exemplary role of Communist Party members is extremely important." With "dare" at the forefront, they boldly stood at the forefront of the revolutionary criticism, leading the masses in a deep and sustained revolutionary criticism. They actively and unceasingly launched attacks on class enemies, achieving one victory after another, turning this supposedly "old backward" brigade into a banner for the entire province in the revolutionary criticism.

How did the revolutionary cadres of Longhua Brigade stand at the forefront of the revolutionary criticism? In their own words: Only by fiercely fighting against selfishness can one dare to revolutionize. At the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, the Chinese Khrushchev promoted the reactionary line of "striking a large area and protecting a small group," which impacted most of the cadres in this brigade. They dared not boldly step forward to lead the revolutionary criticism.

Due to the revolutionary cadres not daring to step forward to lead the masses in actively attacking class enemies, the revolution in this brigade was once affected. However, under the enthusiastic assistance of the propaganda team from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, the revolutionary cadres of Longhua Brigade, with their living thoughts, held Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They repeatedly studied the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, as well as a series of latest instructions such as "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution under the conditions of socialism, a revolution by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the reactionary Kuomintang, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Through the class comparison education of two societies, two family histories, and two futures, the cadres' awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines was heightened. They realized that whether or not to engage in revolutionary criticism is a matter of ensuring the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and a matter of ensuring that our country remains red for generations to come. If we do not carry out revolutionary criticism well, the power we have gained may be lost again, and the poor and lower-middle peasants will suffer twice. After raising their class consciousness, they replaced the "fear" with "dare," the "self" with "public," and the belief in oneself with belief in the masses. They boldly stood at the forefront of the revolutionary criticism. Everyone said: Chairman Mao teaches us, "Never forget class struggle." Hold grudges in your heart and settle accounts with the Chinese Khrushchev. In the past, fearing this and that was ultimately fearing the masses and the revolution, forgetting the importance of power. This was falling into the trap of the Chinese Khrushchev and being poisoned by his toxins. From then on, the revolutionary cadres of Longhua Brigade stood firmly with the masses, igniting the blazing fire of revolutionary criticism. Huang Changsen, the team leader of Yuansheng Production Team, did not understand the great significance of revolutionary criticism in the past and not only did not dare to lead the masses in carrying out the criticism but also did not want to be a cadre. After participating in the study class, Huang Changsen's class consciousness was greatly heightened. He said: In the past, doing so was exactly falling into the trap of the Chinese Khrushchev, handing over power to the class enemies with both hands, being disloyal to Chairman Mao, and being disloyal to the poor and lower-middle peasants. This was forgetting one's roots. During the study class, he carried "Quotations from Chairman Mao" from door to door to mobilize the masses to carry out revolutionary criticism. The masses were deeply moved.

In the revolutionary criticism, the cadres of Longhua Brigade set an example in everything, leading by action and setting an example for the masses. In the past, due to the Chinese Khrushchev promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of "three independences and one contract" and "four freedoms," some cadres' family members sold vegetables grown in their private plots at high prices in the market, which had a bad influence. After the criticism began, from the brigade party branch secretary to the team leaders, they first took the lead in holding family study classes, fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism, and carrying out family revolutionary criticism. They led their entire family in investigating toxins, uprooting revisionist roots, and breaking selfishness to establish public-mindedness. Xu Daiquan, the team leader of Caijing Brigade, had his wife deeply influenced by the toxins of "four freedoms" in the past, thinking of sending fertilizer to the private plot first after collecting it and selling vegetables in the market after harvesting them. After the criticism began, Xu Daiquan held a family study class, fiercely criticizing the toxins of the Chinese Khrushchev's "three independences and one contract," "four freedoms," and "merging public and private" theory. He spoke to his wife about family history, held a remembrance meeting for the family, and had a remembrance meal. After his wife's class consciousness was heightened, she said: If everyone acts for their own interests, the collective economy will collapse, and the Chinese Khrushchev will restore capitalism. She angrily burned the vegetable basket, determined never to do so again. Many cadres' family members also actively and enthusiastically went to the masses' meetings to expose their selfishness, fight against it, and fiercely criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist toxins spread by the Chinese Khrushchev and his local agents. The masses were deeply moved and said, "Cadres lead the way, and the masses follow suit. Cadres serve the public with all their hearts, and the masses also serve the public with all their hearts." Under the leadership and help of the cadres, every household in this brigade held family study classes, and every family carried out revolutionary criticism. From the elderly to the children, everyone read Chairman Mao's books and listened to Chairman Mao's words, striving to be good members of the commune as taught by Chairman Mao.

Through the revolutionary criticism, the masses' awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines was greatly heightened. Everyone firmly declared, "No matter how many paths there are, we must firmly follow the revolutionary path indicated by Chairman Mao."

In the revolutionary criticism, the cadres of Longhua Brigade deeply realized that only by leading the revolution and leading the criticism can they lead the masses to make the revolution and carry out the revolutionary criticism. After more than a year of uninterrupted revolutionary criticism, the brigade's spiritual outlook has undergone great changes, and revolutionary and productive achievements have been made. They removed the so-called "old backward" label. In 1967, grain production increased by 20.4%, and economic crops increased by several times, even more than double, which was an unprecedented record. This year, another bumper harvest is in sight.

Amidst the praise of learning from Longhua from outside, some people developed the slacking thought of "revolutionary criticism has reached its peak." They said, "Theories like 'exploitation has merits,' 'three independences and one contract,' 'four freedoms,' and 'class struggle is extinguished' have all been criticized. Criticizing them again is like reheating leftover food." Some people even said, "Revisionism has been criticized, and selfishness has been fought. What revisionism and selfishness are left to criticize and fight?" In response to these living thoughts, the cadres took the lead in holding study classes, first investigating their own living thoughts in the revolutionary criticism, overcoming rightist complacency, and pushing the revolutionary criticism forward. In the criticism, the cadres of Longhua Brigade always fiercely grasped the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two ideologies. While raising their own consciousness, they helped the masses raise their awareness, solving the living thought of "revolutionary criticism has reached its peak." Cadres and masses together investigated thoughts, feelings, and fighting spirit. They replaced the "arrogance" with "humility" and the "relaxation" with "attack." The masses said, "Class enemies are like green onions under the eaves, with dry skin and rotten roots but not dead. If we relax the criticism, they will come back." Under the leadership of the cadres, the revolutionary criticism in this brigade became more and more profound. The masses said, "Cadres lead the way, and the revolutionary criticism becomes more and more profound, more and more vigorous, and more and more sweet." Combining the actual class struggle in the locality, they created flexible and varied forms such as field criticism, ground criticism, family criticism, joint family criticism, and on-site criticism, making the revolutionary criticism more profound and developed.

After learning from the model deeds of Comrade Meng Hetong, a good cadre who is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, the cadres of Longhua Brigade had an even greater determination to carry out the revolutionary criticism to the end. They declared: They would hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism, lead the broad masses of commune members to thoroughly criticize and expose the counter-revolutionary revisionist line promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, politically, ideologically, and theoretically, eliminate their toxins, defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line for life, stand guard for life, and fight for life.

    “敢”字当头　一心为公　站在阶级斗争第一线
    龙华大队干部带头搞好革命大批判
    本报讯　广东省博罗县龙溪公社龙华大队广大革命干部，在解放军某部毛泽东思想宣传队的热情帮助下，遵照伟大领袖毛主席“共产党员的先锋作用和模范作用是十分重要的”的教导，“敢”字当头，大胆地站到革命大批判的第一线，率领社员深入、持久地开展了革命大批判，主动地不停顿地向阶级敌人进攻，取得一个又一个的胜利，使这个所谓“老落后”大队，在革命大批判中成为全省一面旗帜。
    龙华大队广大革命干部是怎样站到革命大批判第一线呢？用他们的话来讲：只有狠斗私心，才能大胆地干革命。文化大革命初期，中国赫鲁晓夫推行“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，使这个大队的干部大多数受到冲击。他们不敢大胆站出来领导革命大批判。
    由于广大革命干部不敢站出来率领社员主动向阶级敌人进攻，一度使这个大队的革命受到影响。但是，在解放军某部毛泽东思想宣传队的热情帮助下，龙华大队广大革命干部带着自己的活思想举办毛泽东思想学习班，反复学习伟大领袖毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的教导，以及“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续”等一系列最新指示。通过两个社会、两本家史、两个前途的阶级对比教育，干部们提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，认识到搞不搞革命大批判，是关系到无产阶级文化大革命能否夺取全面胜利的保证，是关系到我们国家千秋万代永不变色的大事情。不少干部回忆对比后，深刻地认识到：有了政权就有了一切，失掉政权就丧失一切的伟大真理。如果不搞好革命大批判，我们得到的政权就有重新丧失的危险，贫下中农就会吃二遍苦。他们提高阶级觉悟后，把“怕”字换成“敢”字，把“私”字换成“公”字，把相信自己变为相信群众，大胆地站到革命大批判第一线。大家说：毛主席教导我们“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”，仇要记在心里，账要算在中国赫鲁晓夫身上。过去怕这怕那，说到底就是怕群众，怕革命，忘记了政权的重要性。这是上了中国赫鲁晓夫的当，中了中国赫鲁晓夫的流毒。从此，龙华大队广大革命干部坚定地同社员站到一起，把革命大批判的熊熊烈火点了起来。远景生产队队长黄昌森，过去由于对革命大批判的伟大意义认识不足，不但不敢领导社员开展大批判，而且不愿当干部了。参加学习班后，黄昌森的阶级觉悟大大提高，他说：过去那样做，正好上了中国赫鲁晓夫的当，双手把权送给阶级敌人，对不住毛主席，对不住贫下中农，这是忘本。在学习班期间，他拿着《毛主席语录》挨家挨户地去发动社员开展革命大批判。社员们深受感动。
    在革命大批判中，龙华大队广大干部处处以身作则，以实际行动给社员树立榜样。过去，由于中国赫鲁晓夫推行“三自一包”、“四大自由”反革命修正主义路线，有的干部家属把自留地种的蔬菜挑到市场高价出卖，影响很不好。大批判开始后，从大队党支部书记到生产队长，都首先带头办家庭学习班，斗私批修，开展家庭革命大批判，带领全家查流毒，挖修根，破私立公。财经大队队长徐带全的爱人，过去受“四大自由”流毒影响较深，积了肥就想先往自留地里送，收了菜就想到集市上去卖。大批判开始以后，徐带全办家庭学习班，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫“三自一包”、“四大自由”、“公私溶化”论等流毒，给爱人讲家史，全家开忆苦会，吃忆苦饭。他爱人提高阶级觉悟后说：人人都为私，集体经济就垮台，中国赫鲁晓夫就复辟了。她气愤地把卖菜篮烧了，决心再不那样干了。不少干部家属还主动积极地到群众会上亮私、斗私，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其在当地代理人所散布的反革命修正主义流毒，广大社员深受感动地说：“干部带头红一片。干部一心为公，社员也一心为公。”在干部的带动和帮助下，这个大队每户社员都办起了家庭学习班，家家开展革命大批判，从老人到小孩，人人读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，争做毛主席的好社员。
    通过革命大批判，社员们的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟大大提高，大家坚决表示：“千条路，万条路，要坚决走毛主席他老人家指引的革命路。”
    在革命大批判中，龙华大队广大干部深刻地认识到，只有自己带头革命，带头搞好大批判，才能率领社员闹革命，搞好革命大批判。这个大队经过一年多不间断的革命大批判后，人的精神面貌发生了很大变化，革命和生产取得了很大成绩。他们通过革命大批判，摘掉了所谓“老落后”的帽子。一九六七年粮食增产百分之二十点四，经济作物更是成倍、甚至两倍以上的增产，这是历史上从未有过的纪录。今年又是丰收在望。
    在外地学龙华的一片赞扬声中，有的人产生了“大批判到顶论”的松劲思想。他们说：“剥削有功”、“三自一包”、“四大自由”、“阶级斗争熄灭”论等修正主义黑货都批过了，再批就是“炒冷饭”。有的人还说：“修也批了，私也斗了，还有什么修可批，私可斗呢？”针对这些活思想，广大干部带头举办学习班，首先查自己在革命大批判中的活思想，克服了右倾轻敌情绪，革命大批判又大大推进一步。在大批判中，龙华大队干部始终狠抓两个阶级、两条道路、两种思想的斗争，在自己提高觉悟的同时，帮助社员提高认识，解决“大批判到顶论”的活思想，干部社员一道查思想，查感情，查斗志。把“骄”字换成“谦”字，把“松”字换成“攻”字。社员们说：“阶级敌人好比屋檐下的大葱，皮干根枯心不死，如果放松了大批判，他们就会卷土重来。”在干部的带动下，这个大队的革命大批判越来越深入。社员说：“干部带头，大批判越批越有批头，越批越有劲头，越批越尝到甜头。”结合当地阶级斗争的实际，他们创造了田头批，地头批，家庭批，联家批，现场批等灵活多样的形式，使革命大批判更加深入发展。
    龙华大队广大干部学习了“无限忠于毛主席革命路线的好干部”门合同志的模范事迹后，把革命大批判进行到底的决心更大。他们表示：要更高举起革命批判大旗，带领广大社员群众把中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人所推行的反革命修正主义路线，从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底批倒批臭，肃清其流毒，为捍卫毛主席的革命路线放一辈子哨，站一辈子岗，打一辈子仗。
