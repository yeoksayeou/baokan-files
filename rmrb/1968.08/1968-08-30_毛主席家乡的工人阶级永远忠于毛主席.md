The working class of Chairman Mao's hometown will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao. The delegation from Hunan Province to the National Metallurgy Conference.

The great leader Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "To achieve the proletarian education revolution, it must be led by the working class, and the working class must participate, along with the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, to work together with the students, teachers, and workers in schools who are determined to carry out the proletarian education revolution to the end. The worker propaganda teams must stay in the schools for the long term, participate in all the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and forever lead the schools. In rural areas, the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants—should manage the schools."

"We should establish revolutionary committees with a combination of three elements, conduct a big criticism, clean up the class ranks, rectify the party, streamline organizations, reform unreasonable regulations, and transfer office personnel. The struggle, criticism, and transformation in factories generally go through these stages."

We, the working class from the metallurgy front in Chairman Mao's hometown, with boundless excitement and joy, warmly acclaim the publication of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. After hearing Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the radio, we organized a study session and discussion overnight. The more we studied, the clearer we became, the more we felt that Chairman Mao's latest instructions were the most profound, the most comprehensive, and the most correct. We shouted with all our hearts: Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years to Chairman Mao!

The publication of Chairman Mao's latest instructions greatly boosted the morale of the working class and thoroughly crushed the arrogance of the bourgeoisie. Many old workers excitedly said, only Chairman Mao is the greatest leader of the working class. They said, in the old society, the working class suffered from the oppression and exploitation of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. Politically, they were slaves, and in life, they were worse than cattle. Chairman Mao led us to overthrow the "three big mountains" that weighed on the working class and gained liberation. He is our savior. Chairman Mao personally ignited the flames of the Cultural Revolution, leading us to overthrow China's Khrushchev and his agents in Hunan Province and the Hunan metallurgy front, making the working class truly the masters. Indeed, parents and mothers are not as close as Chairman Mao.

Many worker representatives excitedly said: Chairman Mao gave the working class the highest evaluation, entrusting the heavy responsibility of leading socialist revolution and socialist construction to the working class, asking us to lead everything. Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "People's democratic dictatorship needs the leadership of the working class. Because only the working class has the foresight, is selfless, and is the most thorough in revolution. The entire history of revolution proves that without the leadership of the working class, the revolution will fail, and with the leadership of the working class, the revolution will win." At this crucial moment of achieving a comprehensive victory in the proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao profoundly pointed out: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully play the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work. The working class should also continuously improve its political awareness in the struggle." Recently, Chairman Mao issued the latest instruction that "to achieve the proletarian education revolution, it must be led by the working class." This is the greatest trust, the greatest encouragement, and the greatest inspiration for us, the working class. The working class of Chairman Mao's hometown supports it a thousand times and will carry it out ten thousand times.

We came from Chairman Mao's hometown to attend the meeting at Chairman Mao's side, studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions at Chairman Mao's side, feeling especially intimate. We pledge to Chairman Mao: The working class of Chairman Mao's hometown will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, forever loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, forever loyal to the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and forever follow Chairman Mao to do revolution for life. We are determined to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, fully implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution.

    毛主席家乡的工人阶级永远忠于毛主席
    全国冶金会议湖南代表团
    伟大领袖毛主席最近指示我们：“实现无产阶级教育革命，必须有工人阶级领导，必须有工人群众参加，配合解放军战士，同学校的学生、教员、工人中决心把无产阶级教育革命进行到底的积极分子实行革命的三结合。工人宣传队要在学校中长期留下去，参加学校中全部斗、批、改任务，并且永远领导学校。在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校。”“建立三结合的革命委员会，大批判，清理阶级队伍，整党，精简机构、改革不合理的规章制度、下放科室人员，工厂里的斗、批、改，大体经历这么几个阶段。”
    我们来自毛主席家乡的冶金战线上的工人阶级，以无比激动、无比喜悦的心情，最热烈地欢呼毛主席最新指示的发表。从广播里听到毛主席的最新指示以后，我们连夜组织了学习和讨论，越学心里越亮堂，越学越感到毛主席最新指示最精辟、最深刻、最全面、最正确，我们纵情高呼：毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！
    毛主席最新指示的发表，大长了工人阶级的志气，大灭了资产阶级的威风。许多老工人激动地说，只有毛主席才是我们工人阶级最伟大的领袖。他们说，在旧社会，工人阶级受尽了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的压迫和剥削，在政治上是奴隶，在生活上牛马不如。毛主席他老人家领导我们推翻了压在工人阶级头上的“三座大山”，得到了解放，他老人家是我们工人阶级的救命恩人。毛主席他老人家亲自点燃了文化大革命的烈火，领导我们打倒了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在湖南省和湖南冶金战线的代理人，使我们工人阶级真正当家作了主人。真是爹亲娘亲，不如毛主席亲。
    许多工人代表激动地说：毛主席他老人家给我们工人阶级最高的评价，把领导社会主义革命和社会主义建设的重担子交给我们工人阶级，要我们工人阶级领导一切。毛主席早就指出：“人民民主专政需要工人阶级的领导。因为只有工人阶级最有远见，大公无私，最富于革命的彻底性。整个革命历史证明，没有工人阶级的领导，革命就要失败，有了工人阶级的领导，革命就胜利了。”在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的关键时刻，毛主席深刻地指出：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”最近，毛主席又发出了关于“实现无产阶级教育革命，必须有工人阶级领导”的最新指示，这是对我们工人阶级的最大信任，最大鞭策，最大鼓舞。我们毛主席家乡的工人阶级一千个拥护，一万个照办。
    我们从毛主席家乡来到毛主席身边开会，在毛主席身边学习毛主席最新指示，感到格外亲切。我们向毛主席宣誓：毛主席家乡的工人阶级永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的革命路线，永远忠于以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，永远紧跟毛主席干一辈子革命。我们决心紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，认真搞好斗、批、改，夺取文化大革命的全面胜利。
