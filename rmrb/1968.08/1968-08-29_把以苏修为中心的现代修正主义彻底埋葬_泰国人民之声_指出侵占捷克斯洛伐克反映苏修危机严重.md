	"The Voice of the Thai People" radio station broadcasted an article on the 27th, strongly condemning the Soviet revisionist renegade clique's blatant military invasion and occupation of Czechoslovakia, and firmly supporting the Czechoslovakian people's struggle against the invasion.

	The article pointed out that the Soviet revisionist renegade clique's military occupation of Czechoslovakia is a fascist act of aggression that fully exposes the counter-revolutionary, ugly face of the Soviet revisionist renegade clique, reflecting the severe crisis within the modern revisionist clique centered on the Soviet revisionists. The article said that this time, the Soviet revisionist renegade clique, together with its followers, brazenly sent troops to occupy Czechoslovakia, which is the result of the Soviet revisionist renegade clique's pursuit of great-power chauvinism and national selfishness, the result of extremely sharp contradictions within the entire modern revisionist clique, and the result of the extremely sharp contradictions between American imperialism and the Soviet revisionist leadership in their struggle to control Eastern Europe and redivide the world. The Soviet revisionist renegade clique's aggressive crimes have made the world's revolutionary people clearly see that the modern revisionist clique is already thoroughly corrupt, completely betraying Marxism-Leninism.

	The article pointed out that the Soviet Union under the rule of the revisionist clique is no longer a socialist country. The Soviet people, the Czechoslovakian people, and the people of Eastern European countries, as well as the revolutionary people of the whole world, have seen more clearly from the Soviet revisionist renegade clique's aggressive crimes the counter-revolutionary, ugly face of modern revisionism, and are awakening and firmly rising up to oppose revisionism. This makes the Soviet revisionist renegade clique increasingly isolated.

	The article went on to say that the great teacher of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao Zedong, pointed out: "Although the leadership of the party and the state in the Soviet Union has now been usurped by the revisionists, I advise comrades to firmly believe that the broad masses of the Soviet people, the broad ranks of party members and cadres, are good, are revolutionary, and the rule of revisionism will not last long."

	The article said that the revolutionary people of Thailand, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, firmly condemn the Soviet revisionist renegade clique and its followers' aggression against Czechoslovakia, firmly support the Czechoslovakian people's struggle against Soviet aggression, firmly support the Soviet revolutionary people's support for the Czechoslovakian people's struggle against Soviet aggression, and firmly support the Soviet revolutionary people, the Czechoslovakian people, and the revolutionary people of countries ruled by modern revisionism in rising up to wage revolutionary struggles to overthrow the reactionary rule of modern revisionism. The article firmly believes that under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, the Soviet people, the Czechoslovakian people, and the people of other countries under revisionist rule, through resolute struggles, will one day completely bury the modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionists.

    把以苏修为中心的现代修正主义彻底埋葬
    “泰国人民之声”指出侵占捷克斯洛伐克反映苏修危机严重
    新华社二十八日讯“泰国人民之声”电台二十七日广播一篇文章，强烈谴责苏修叛徒集团公然出兵武装占领捷克斯洛伐克的侵略罪行，坚决支持捷克斯洛伐克人民反抗侵略的斗争。
    文章指出，苏修叛徒集团对捷克斯洛伐克实行军事占领这一法西斯侵略行为，充分地暴露了苏修叛徒集团的反革命狰狞面目，反映出以苏修为中心的现代修正主义集团的严重危机。文章说，这次苏修叛徒集团纠集它的追随者悍然出兵占领捷克斯洛伐克，是苏修叛徒集团推行大国沙文主义和民族利己主义的结果，是整个现代修正主义集团内部矛盾极其尖锐化的结果，是美帝国主义同苏修领导集团争夺东欧和重新瓜分世界的矛盾极度尖锐化的结果。苏修叛徒集团的侵略罪行，使世界革命人民清楚地看到现代修正主义集团已经十分腐败，它们完全背叛了马克思列宁主义。
    文章指出，修正主义集团统治下的苏联已经不是社会主义国家。苏联人民、捷克斯洛伐克人民和东欧各国人民以及全世界革命人民，从这次苏修叛徒集团的侵略罪行中，更进一步看清了现代修正主义的反革命狰狞面目，加速觉醒，坚决起来反对修正主义。这就使苏修叛徒集团越来越孤立。
    文章接着说，世界革命人民的伟大导师毛泽东主席指出：“虽然，苏联的党和国家的领导现在被修正主义者篡夺了，但是，我劝同志们坚决相信，苏联广大的人民、广大的党员和干部，是好的，是要革命的，修正主义的统治是不会长久的。”
    文章说，泰国共产党英明领导下的泰国革命人民，坚决谴责苏修叛徒集团及其追随者侵略捷克斯洛伐克的罪行，坚决支持捷克斯洛伐克人民反对苏修侵略的斗争，坚决支持苏联革命人民支持捷克斯洛伐克人民反对苏修侵略的斗争，坚决支持苏联革命人民、捷克斯洛伐克以及被现代修正主义统治的国家的革命人民起来进行革命斗争，推翻现代修正主义的反动统治。文章坚信，在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想指引下，苏联人民、捷克斯洛伐克人民以及修正主义统治下的其它各国人民经过坚决的斗争，终有一天要把以苏修为中心的现代修正主义彻底埋葬。
