Our Zigong City People's Armed Forces Department, with an unyielding heart devoted to Chairman Mao, responded to the great leader Mao Zedong's call to "support the broad leftist masses" during the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We have consistently adhered to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, working together with the proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad masses of the people in Zigong City, sharing joys and sorrows, and resisting and smashing the capitalist restoration countercurrent of last February, as well as the rightist revisionist wind. We were the first in the province to establish a revolutionary committee.

After the establishment of the revolutionary committee, how did our armed forces department continue to support the left? From our practical struggles, we have come to understand that bringing the glorious traditions and fine styles of our army into the revolutionary committee, and building the revolutionary committee into a command center that emphasizes proletarian politics, is closely connected to the masses, and is highly proletarian, is the central content and sacred duty of our support to the left in the new situation.

Bringing the democratic style of our army into the revolutionary committee, making the revolutionary committee deeply rooted among the masses

In the past, we supported and protected the masses, mainly by helping them aim their cannons at the capitalist roaders and launch fierce attacks. Now that the "three-in-one combination" revolutionary committee has been established, the masses, in order to help and protect the revolutionary committee, sometimes give the revolutionary committee sharp criticisms. Some of our comrades in the armed forces department, from previously supporting them in seizing power to now holding power, have changed their status. How should they correctly treat the masses and protect the revolutionary spirit of the masses? This is a new test for us, the People's Liberation Army.

When the revolutionary committee of Zigong City was established last year, some masses suggested that the revolutionary committee be set up in the original "Secretary's Residence" of the municipal committee, reasoning that the environment there was quiet and convenient for work. We also thought that since the "Secretary's Residence" was empty, it was quiet and also made use of the old building, which would otherwise be wasted if not used. Thus, we decided to set up the municipal revolutionary committee there. This news, once spread, immediately provoked a reaction from the masses. A comrade from the municipal workers' congress rushed over and said angrily, "That place was the command center of the capitalist roaders for suppressing the masses. The house is so high-class, it doesn't look like a place where the laboring people are in power. If you don't move out, I won't go there again!"

This opinion caused different views among the members of the municipal revolutionary committee. Some said, "The capitalist roaders can live there, why can't we, the rebels, live there? The house is a form, the important thing is the ideology, as long as the ideology is correct, it's fine." At that time, we studied Chairman Mao's teachings and believed that we should carry forward the democratic style of our army and be good at listening to different opinions. Moreover, this house is indeed relatively high-class in Zigong. The revolutionary committee has not yet started work, but first thought about the quiet environment. This reflects the ideological problem of some members of the revolutionary committee. If we do not move out, there is indeed a danger of becoming detached from the masses. At the same time, we also believed that the opinion of the comrade from the workers' congress was a concern and love for the revolutionary committee. Although he said a few harsh words, it was still well-intentioned and helpful to our progress. We cannot generally think that all criticisms of the revolutionary committee are directed at the revolutionary power. We must resolutely expose and severely strike down malicious attacks from class enemies; we must warmly welcome and humbly accept benevolent criticisms from the masses, which is very necessary for us to perfect and develop the revolutionary committee. Soon, we received a plaque from the students of the Second Middle School celebrating the establishment of the municipal revolutionary committee. The plaque had eleven shining golden words: "Revolutionize, otherwise it is dangerous." This further proved that the opinion of the comrade from the workers' congress represented the views of the masses. Thus, we quickly moved out of the "Secretary's Residence" and hung the plaque from the Second Middle School students high on the wall of the office entrance, so that the members of our revolutionary committee could see it as soon as they entered the door, always vigilant and taking it as a warning. After the establishment of the revolutionary committee, the chairman of the revolutionary committee, military representative Li Zongbai, and other comrades personally visited the comrades from the workers' congress and the students of the Second Middle School to express their thanks for their concern and to praise and protect their revolutionary spirit.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The reform of state organs, the most fundamental thing, is to be connected with the masses." Deputy Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee, Deputy Political Commissar of the Armed Forces Department, Zhang Chongliang, realized that carrying forward the democratic style of our army is not only about listening to the opinions brought by the masses but also about actively going down to solicit opinions, closely connecting with the masses, implementing the leadership method of "from the masses, to the masses," and giving full play to the power of the newly born revolutionary committee. In February this year, he went down to the commune and learned that in a production team, a counter-revolutionary element took advantage of his son's wedding to hold a grand banquet, inviting the proletarian revolutionary factions to eat. This plot was seen through by the proletarian revolutionary factions, who immediately exposed his counter-revolutionary nature. Zhang Chongliang immediately found the leaders of the proletarian revolutionary factions at the commune and brigade levels to discuss together, explaining that this was a new method used by the class enemy under new conditions to attack us with sugar-coated bullets, which must be thoroughly exposed among the masses, educating the masses and raising alertness. Thus, we immediately held a struggle meeting, exposing and criticizing this counter-revolutionary element to the masses, timely raising the class struggle and two-line struggle awareness of the broad masses. We also used this incident as a typical case to educate the whole city, raising everyone's awareness of the struggle against the enemy.

Bringing the continuous combat style of our army into the revolutionary committee, leading the broad revolutionary masses to actively and unceasingly attack the enemy

Our city has an East Wind Salt Factory, with three revolutionary mass organizations: "August 1st," "Defenders," and "Hard Bones." In the past, they were all fighting side by side. However, last July, the internal strife between some of the staff of the three organizations became increasingly fierce, to the point where they came to our armed forces department. We heard that they were all talking about internal matters, not mentioning the capitalist roaders at all. We were puzzled and intentionally asked, "How is the enemy situation in your factory? Are there any activities by the capitalist roaders?" The comrades who had been talking non-stop suddenly fell silent. We told them, "First, go back and severely criticize the capitalist roaders in your factory. As for your internal problems, we'll discuss them next time you come."

These people returned to the factory and, through severe criticism of the capitalist roaders, discovered that their previous mutual attacks were the result of the capitalist roaders using their selfishness to sow discord behind their backs. Later, the three organizations mobilized the masses to expose the enemy situation and carry out revolutionary criticism and struggle, exposing a remnant of the reactionary Kuomintang who had infiltrated the mass organizations and caused trouble. This time, the comrades of the three combat teams all received education and quickly solved their own problems. At that time, we thought that the path taken by the East Wind Salt Factory had educational significance for other units. Thus, we introduced and promoted the experience of the East Wind Salt Factory throughout the city, greatly promoting the in-depth development of the revolutionary criticism and struggle throughout the city. Before the revolutionary criticism and struggle was well carried out, the masses reflected that the capitalist roaders did not stink, the rebels did not smell good, the revolutionary masses were not united, and the production output was not high. Now the reflection is: the capitalist roaders stink, the rebels smell good, the revolutionary masses are united, and the production output is high.

Bringing the tradition of emphasizing politics in our army into the revolutionary committee, making the revolutionary committee a highly proletarian combat command center

At the beginning of this year, when preparing for the first expanded meeting of the municipal revolutionary committee and studying the method of holding the meeting, someone proposed to first focus on ideology and then on practical matters, study a section of Chairman Mao's works, and discuss a production issue. Revolutionary leading cadres, the original deputy mayor, even counted on his fingers for us: today is the first day of the month, how many days until Qingming, still need to select seeds, transplant seedlings, fertilize, and level the fields. Just talking about politics will delay the agricultural season and become an empty politician. We countered these thoughts by repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's teachings: "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." "The people have limitless creativity. They can organize and march to all places and departments where they can exert their strength, march to the depth and breadth of production, and create more and more welfare for themselves." We let everyone understand that this meeting is to do the work of "organizing" and "exerting" strength, to use Mao Zedong Thought as a powerful weapon to "organize" and "exert" the boundless strength of the people. Whether it is "ideological" or "practical," it must be implemented according to Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The full implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions is the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. By grasping the revolution, production can be promoted, and people's thoughts can be revolutionized to overcome any great difficulties. This is not being an "empty politician," but the method of a proletarian revolutionary.

After unifying the understanding of the leading members, when holding the meeting, we focused on studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions and related discussions on political work with problems; recalling the serious harm caused by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Zigong in emphasizing production; severely criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line in industrial and agricultural construction. Finally, in half a day, we studied the specific problems in production. The result was that we completed the transplanting 12 days earlier than the earliest transplanting time before the Cultural Revolution, achieving full transplanting. The entire transplanting time was also shortened by more than 10 days compared to the past. This year, the small spring crops in the whole city also had a bumper harvest, and the state procurement task has been overfulfilled.

In this meeting, we received great enlightenment and education. Although the proletarian revolutionary factions have seized the party, government, financial, and cultural power from the capitalist roaders, the poison of the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the construction of political power over the past decade has not been thoroughly eliminated from people's minds. It will reveal itself at any opportunity, consciously or unconsciously, and resist Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Without strengthening the education of the two-line struggle, it is not clear what is socialism, what is capitalism, what is Marxism-Leninism, and what is revisionism. In the long run, the old road of not emphasizing proletarian politics will be taken again, and the revolutionary power will deteriorate. This is a serious problem that we must be highly vigilant about. At this time, we repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "The Chinese Red Army is a revolutionary political task force. Especially now, the Red Army is not just about fighting. In addition to fighting to destroy the enemy's military force, it also has to undertake major tasks such as propagating to the masses, organizing the masses, arming the masses, helping the masses to establish revolutionary power, and even establishing the organization of the Communist Party." We realized that the current center of the armed forces department's support to the left is to "help the masses establish revolutionary power." What kind of power should we build after seizing power? This is a major political issue related to "where China is going." Bringing Chairman Mao's entire set of policies and principles of emphasizing political construction in our army into the revolutionary committee, taking the road of the "Gutian Meeting," thoroughly getting rid of the influence of only focusing on grain, cotton, and oil production in the past, thoroughly criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist line in the construction of political power, and building the newly born revolutionary committee into a combat command center that emphasizes proletarian politics, this is the fundamental consolidation of the achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the fundamental consolidation of the proletarian power, and the fundamental protection of the broad masses of the people. Subsequently, we changed the eight groups and one office under the municipal revolutionary committee, such as agriculture, forestry, industry and commerce, finance and trade, and culture and health, into four groups: political work group, office group, security group, and production group. The number of personnel was reduced from the original more than 200 to more than 60, vigorously implementing Chairman Mao's instructions on the revolutionary committee to "streamline administration," and ensuring the revolutionary construction of being connected with the masses and emphasizing proletarian politics from an organizational perspective.

　　把我军着重政治建军的光荣传统带进新生的革命委员会
　　人民解放军四川省自贡市人民武装部
    我们自贡市人民武装部，以一颗无限忠于毛主席的红心，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，响应伟大领袖毛主席关于“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号召，始终坚持毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，和自贡市无产阶级革命派、广大人民群众一起，同甘共苦，抵制和粉碎了去年二月的资本主义复辟逆流，抵制和粉碎了右倾翻案妖风，在全省第一个成立了革命委员会。
    在革命委员会成立后，我们武装部是如何继续支左的呢？我们从斗争实践中体会到：把我军的光荣传统和优良作风带进革委会，把革委会建成一个突出无产阶级政治的、密切联系群众的、非常无产阶级化的战斗指挥部，是我们在新形势下支左的中心内容和神圣职责。
    把我军的民主作风带进革委会，让革委会深深扎根于群众之中
    我们过去支持和保护群众，更多的是支持他们把炮口对准走资派，猛打猛攻。现在成立了“三结合”的革命委员会，群众为了帮助和爱护革委会，有时也给革委会提出尖锐意见，我们武装部的一些同志，由原来支持他们夺权到现在掌权，地位起了变化之后，应该怎样正确地对待群众，保护群众的革命精神呢？这对我们人民解放军又是一个新的考验。
    去年自贡市成立革委会的时候，部分群众建议把革委会设在原市委的“书记院”，理由是那里的环境安静，便于办公。我们也想，反正“书记院”是空着的，一则安静，二则也是利用旧房，不住人反倒浪费了，于是就决定把市革委会设在那里。这消息一传出，就引起了群众的反映。市工代会的一个同志气冲冲的跑来对我们说：“那个鬼地方是原来走资派镇压群众的指挥部，房子那么高级，不象我们劳动人民掌权的地方，你们不搬出来，我再也不到那里去了！”
    这个意见，引起了市革委会成员的不同看法。有的说：“走资派能住，我们造反派为啥不能住？房子是形式，重要的是思想，只要思想注意就行了。”我们当时学习了毛主席的教导，认为应该发扬我军的民主作风，善于倾听不同意见。再说，这房子在自贡确实比较高级，革委会还没工作就首先想到环境安静，这正反映了革委会部分成员的思想问题，再不搬出来，确实有脱离群众的危险。同时我们也认为，工代会那个同志的意见是对革委会的关心和爱护，尽管说了两句气话，还是善意的，是帮助我们前进的。不能笼统的认为，凡是批评革委会的都是把矛头指向了革命政权。对于来自阶级敌人的恶意的攻击，要坚决揭露，狠狠打击；对于来自群众的善意的批评，要热情欢迎，虚心接受，这对我们完善和发展革命委员会是十分需要的。不久，我们又接到二中学生送来的庆祝市革委会成立的一块匾，匾上有十一个金光闪闪的大字：“来一个革命化。否则很危险。”这就进一步证明了工代会那个同志的意见，是代表了群众的看法的。于是，我们很快搬出了“书记院”，并把二中学生送来的那块匾，高挂在办公室的进门处，让我们革委会的成员一进门就能看见，时刻警惕，引以为戒。革委会成立后，革委会主任、军代表李宗白等同志还亲自找工代会的同志和二中的学生交谈，感谢他们的关心，表扬和保护了他们的革命精神。
    毛主席教导我们：“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”革委会副主任、武装部副政委张崇亮同志认识到：发扬我军的民主作风，不仅要倾听群众送上门的意见，还要主动下去征求意见，密切联系群众，实行“从群众中来，到群众中去”的领导方法，发挥新生革委会的威力。今年二月他下到公社，了解到一个生产队里有个反革命分子，借他儿子结婚大摆酒席，请无产阶级革命派去吃饭，这一阴谋被无产阶级革命派看穿了，当场就造了他的反。张崇亮同志立即找社、队无产阶级革命派的头头一起商量，说明这是阶级敌人在新的条件下，利用糖衣炮弹向我们进攻的新手法，必须在群众中彻底揭穿，教育群众，引起警惕。于是，我们立即召开了斗争大会，把这个反革命分子揪出来进行了群众性的揭发批判，及时提高了广大社员的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。并把这个事件作为典型，对全市进行教育，提高大家对敌斗争的自觉性。
    把我军连续作战的作风带进革委会，带领广大革命群众向敌人主动地、不停顿地进攻
    我市有个东风盐厂，里面有“八一”、“捍卫”、“硬骨头”三个革命群众组织。过去，他们都是并肩战斗在一起的。可是去年七月，三个组织的部分勤务员之间，为联合的核心问题，“内战”越打越凶，一直闹到我们武装部来了。我们一听都是扯些内部事，对走资派却一句也没有提。我们很奇怪，有意问了一句：“你们厂的敌情如何？走资派有活动没有？”刚才还说得不停嘴的一些同志，这时却哑口无言了。我们就告诉他们：“先回去把厂里的走资派狠狠地进行批判。至于你们内部的问题，下次来了再说。”
    这些人回厂通过狠批走资派才发现，原先互相攻击，都是走资派利用了他们的私心，在背后挑拨离间所造成的。后来，这三个组织发动群众大摆敌情，大搞革命大批判，还揭露出一个混进群众组织内部兴风作浪的国民党反动派残渣余孽。这下三个战斗团的同志都受到了教育，很快解决了自己的问题。当时我们想：东风盐厂走过的这段路，对其他单位也是有教育意义的。于是，我们在全市介绍推广东风盐厂的经验，大大促进了全市革命大批判的深入开展。在没有很好开展革命大批判以前，群众反映走资派不臭，造反派不香，革命群众之间不和，生产产量不高。现在的反映是：走资派臭了，造反派香了，革命群众之间和了，生产产量高了。
    把我军突出政治的传统带进革委会，使革委会成为一个非常无产阶级化的战斗司令部
    今年年初，在筹备市革委会第一次扩大会议，研究会议的开法时，有人提出要先务虚，后务实，学一段毛主席著作，议一个生产问题。革命领导干部、原一位副市长，还扳着指头给我们算：今天是初几，多久过清明，还要选种、插秧、送肥、整田，光谈政治就要耽误农时，当空头政治家了。我们针对这些思想，首先反复学习毛主席“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”“人民群众有无限的创造力。他们可以组织起来，向一切可以发挥自己力量的地方和部门进军，向生产的深度和广度进军，替自己创造日益增多的福利事业”的教导，让大家认识到这次会议，就是要作“组织”和“发挥”力量的工作，就是用毛泽东思想这一强大的武器去“组织”、“发挥”人民群众的无穷无尽的力量。所谓“务虚”也好，“务实”也好，都要落实毛主席的一系列最新指示。毛主席最新指示的全面落实，就是无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。抓了革命，生产就能促上去，人的思想革命化了，天大的困难也能克服。这不是“空头政治家”，而正是无产阶级革命家的作法。
    统一了领导成员的认识后，在开会的时候，我们就着重带着问题反复学习毛主席一系列最新指示和有关政治工作的论述；回忆中国赫鲁晓夫及其在自贡的代理人突出生产所造成的严重危害；狠批中国赫鲁晓夫在工农业建设上的反革命修正主义路线。最后，只用半天的时间，研究了生产中的具体问题。结果比文化大革命前最早插秧的时间还提前十二天，实现了全市的满栽满插。整个插秧的时间，也比过去缩短了十多天。今年全市小春作物又获丰收，国家征购任务已经超额完成。
    在这次会议上，我们受到了很大的启发和教育。无产阶级革命派虽然已从走资派手里夺回了党、政、财、文大权，但中国赫鲁晓夫十多年来在政权建设上的反革命修正主义的流毒，在人们头脑里还没有彻底肃清，它一有机会就要露出头来，自觉不自觉地和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线相对抗。不加强两条路线斗争的教育，分不清什么是社会主义，什么是资本主义，什么是马列主义，什么是修正主义，久而久之，又会走不突出无产阶级政治的老路，革命政权就会变质。这是值得我们引起高度警惕的严重问题。这时，我们又反复学习了毛主席的教导：“中国的红军是一个执行革命的政治任务的武装集团。特别是现在，红军决不是单纯地打仗的，它除了打仗消灭敌人军事力量之外，还要负担宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众、帮助群众建立革命政权以至于建立共产党的组织等项重大的任务。”我们认识到，当前武装部支左的一项中心内容，就是“帮助群众建立革命政权”，我们夺权之后，要建设一个什么样的政权呢？这是一个关系到“中国向何处去”的重大政治问题。把毛主席关于我军着重政治建军的一整套方针、原则带进革委会去，走“古田会议”的道路，彻底摆脱过去只抓粮、棉、油生产的影响，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设上的修正主义路线，把新生的革命委员会建设成为一个突出无产阶级政治的战斗指挥部，这就从根本上巩固了无产阶级文化大革命的战果，从根本上巩固了无产阶级的政权，也就从根本上保护了广大人民群众。随后，我们就把市革委会下设的农林、工交、财贸、文卫等八组一室，改为政工组、办事组、保卫组、生产组四个组，人员由原二百多人减少为六十多人，大力贯彻毛主席关于革命委员会要“精兵简政”的指示，从组织上保证了联系群众、突出无产阶级政治的革命化建设。
