The People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed in Liaoyuan Electric Machine Factory, following Chairman Mao's instructions on "precision and simplification," assisted the factory's revolutionary committee in emphasizing proletarian politics. They focused on the active thoughts of the personnel who were transferred down, intensifying class struggle and education on the two-line struggle. This ensured that these individuals not only settled in the production teams but also aligned their thoughts with the teams, thereby consolidating and developing the new revolutionary power. They promptly thwarted the class enemies' schemes to sabotage the precision and simplification efforts.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The revolutionary committee must implement unified leadership, break down overlapping administrative structures, streamline and simplify, and organize a revolutionary leadership team that is connected with the masses." Under the guidance of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, the Liaoyuan Electric Machine Factory's revolutionary committee and the revolutionary workers began the "precision and simplification" work early on. Many cadres volunteered to go to the production teams to "settle down." However, soon some cadres changed their minds, telling the revolutionary committee members: "My health is not good, and I can't handle the work alongside the workers." Others emphasized: "I don't know the technology, and going down there won't contribute much. If working in the electric machine factory isn't suitable, please transfer me to another factory."

Why did the work, which was about to be completed, encounter new twists? Chairman Mao teaches us: "Can't you solve that problem? Then go and investigate the current state and history of that problem! Once you have thoroughly investigated, you will have a solution to that problem." The revolutionary committee and the propaganda team followed Chairman Mao's instructions, conducting in-depth investigations in the teams and dormitories, talking with workers and holding discussions with cadres. Through thorough investigations, they discovered that someone was spreading rumors and sowing discord behind the scenes. Some cadres, unable to see through the class enemies' schemes, were also mistakenly thinking that they had been demoted, and their resolve to go to the workshops to work as laborers wavered.

From these facts, the revolutionary committee members deeply felt that "precision and simplification" is not just a simple personnel adjustment; it is a great revolution, a serious class struggle. To ensure the smooth progress of the "precision and simplification" work, it is necessary to intensify the class struggle and raise the cadres' awareness through struggle. Therefore, the revolutionary committee convened a full-factory revolutionary workers' meeting to expose the class enemies' evil schemes to sabotage precision and simplification, mobilizing the revolutionary masses and cadres to engage in face-to-face struggles with the class enemies, thoroughly criticizing their reactionary actions, and clarifying the cadres' minds. The cadres raised their awareness, firmly obeyed the revolutionary committee's decisions, and happily went to the teams to work as ordinary laborers.

Launching a revolutionary critique to fight against old habits and forces

The cadres went to the teams, but was the precision and simplification work completed? The revolutionary committee members believed that this was only the beginning, not the end. Settling in the teams did not mean that their thoughts had taken root among the masses. To ensure that the transferred personnel truly took root among the masses, a lot of ideological and political work still needed to be done.

One day, Deputy Director Zhang Zhizhong went to the team for labor, noticing that a transferred cadre's spirit was not as vibrant. Through a heart-to-heart talk, he learned that this comrade heard someone whispering that he had been a party member for many years with no merits but had labors, and now he was going to work as a laborer, which was a sign of no future. He himself also felt that he used to lead others, but now others were leading him, and he couldn't save face, causing him to have knots in his thoughts and lacking the spirit to work. Back at the revolutionary committee, Zhang Zhizhong reported this situation. Everyone analyzed the cause and believed that this was an old habit and force at play, and the poison of Khrushchev's "join the party to become an official" theory had not been completely eliminated. To thoroughly eliminate the poison and better educate the cadres, the revolutionary committee, with the assistance of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, established a Mao Zedong Thought study class for the transferred cadres. Chairman Mao said: "Our party and state cadres are ordinary laborers, not lords sitting on the heads of the people." "We communists are not here to be officials but to make a revolution." The cadres, following Chairman Mao's instructions, used the magic mirror of Mao Zedong Thought to fiercely criticize Khrushchev's "join the party to become an official" theory. The revolutionary critique greatly raised the cadres' awareness of class struggle and the two-line struggle. Some comrades said well: Serving the people is our starting point for considering problems; being among the masses and being an ordinary laborer is our footing for action; being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is our destination. Only by doing well in these three aspects can one be a person beneficial to the people. The cadres, filled with revolutionary enthusiasm, decided to eliminate all interference and firmly walk the path of "precision and simplification" pointed out by Chairman Mao.

Intensifying active thoughts and carrying out struggles in the ideological realm

Through launching the revolutionary critique, the transferred cadres stood firm against some rumors and gossip, and their feet were stable in the teams, working with a peaceful mind. However, the revolutionary committee members were not satisfied with this. They believed that as the revolution advances, ideological work must keep up with the new situation. The cadres settling in the teams did not mean that the ideological work was done. To make them all become leaders in the ideological revolution, more work needed to be done. They firmly remembered Chairman Mao's instruction: "Mastering ideological education is the key link in uniting the whole party to engage in great political struggles," and continued to intensively do a good job in the active thoughts of the transferred cadres, making the precision and simplification work even better. Sometimes they held symposiums to understand the thoughts of the transferred cadres, and sometimes they listened to the masses' opinions to understand the pulse of the transferred cadres' thoughts, treating the symptoms. They found that some comrades, after being transferred to the teams, thought that as long as they obeyed the transfer and worked hard, that was enough. Therefore, they only focused on work, forgetting the important responsibility of propagating to the masses and leading the masses to advance better. The revolutionary committee members seized this active thought, organizing the transferred cadres to study, reviewing Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "precision and simplification," organizing them to recall the pain of the laboring people without power, displaying the difficulty of the billions of revolutionary masses seizing back the power usurped by Khrushchev, and seeing the profound significance of implementing "precision and simplification" to build the revolutionary power, thereby arousing everyone's class feelings and consciously contributing to consolidating and developing the new revolutionary power. Many transferred cadres deeply felt: "We work in the workshop, but our hearts must contain the world, always thinking of serving the 300 million people."

Afterward, the comrades, standing by the lathe, looked towards Beijing, consciously shouldering the double burden of revolution and production, becoming leaders in the ideological revolution of the workers. They led the way in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the teams, sharing their learning experiences; led the way in criticizing Khrushchev's revisionist line in the industrial front, and led the way in technological innovation. The original workshop director, Li Yingren, after becoming the production group leader in the machine repair team, saw that the revolutionary critique in the small group was not vigorous enough, so he took the initiative to discuss with the political group leader, coming up with ideas and methods, making the revolutionary critique in the entire group vigorous. When the grinder broke down, he, with the spirit of self-reliance and thrift in running the enterprise, led the workers to repair it, ensuring the normal progress of production. Many transferred cadres, with their model actions, gained the trust and praise of the workers. The workers said, "The old generation of cadres moves forward, and the new generation follows, the predecessors do not separate from the masses, and the later generations have examples to follow. Our people's country will be red for generations!"

    用毛泽东思想统帅精兵简政工作
    辽源电机厂狠抓阶级斗争，狠抓活思想，精兵简政工作深入扎实
    解放军驻吉林省辽源电机厂毛泽东思想宣传队，遵照毛主席“精兵简政”的教导，帮助这个厂的革命委员会突出无产阶级政治，针对下放人员的活思想，狠抓阶级斗争和两条路线斗争教育，使他们不但人在班组落户，而且思想也在班组落户，从而巩固和发展了新生的革命政权。及时粉碎阶级敌人破坏精兵简政的阴谋
    毛主席教导我们：“革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”辽源电机厂革命委员会和广大革命职工在驻厂毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，很早就开始做“精兵简政”的工作。许多干部纷纷要求到生产班组去“安家落户”。可是不久，有的干部突然变了卦，找到革委会的同志说：“我身体不好，下去和工人一块干活吃不消。”也有的强调说：“自己不懂技术，下去也顶不了一个劳动力，如果在电机厂工作不合适，请把我调到外厂工作。”
    为什么眼看就要完成的工作又发生了新的波折呢？毛主席教导我们说：“你对于那个问题不能解决么？那末，你就去调查那个问题的现状和它的历史吧！你完完全全调查明白了，你对那个问题就有解决的办法了。”革委会和宣传队的同志遵循毛主席的这一教导，深入班组、宿舍，找工人谈心，找干部座谈。经过深入的调查研究，发现有人在背后煽阴风、点鬼火，到处散布谣言。对于阶级敌人的阴谋，有的干部一时看不清、顶不住，也错误地认为自己是被罢了官，下车间当工人的决心动摇了。
    从这些事实中，革委会的同志们深深感到，“精兵简政”决不是一次简单的人事调动，这是一次伟大的革命，是一场严肃的阶级斗争。要使“精兵简政”的工作顺利进行，必须狠抓阶级斗争，在斗争中提高干部们的觉悟。于是，革委会召开全厂革命职工大会，揭发阶级敌人破坏精兵简政的罪恶阴谋，发动全厂革命群众和革命干部向阶级敌人进行面对面的斗争，彻底批判他们的反动言行，擦亮了干部们的眼睛。干部们提高了认识，坚决服从革委会的决定，欢欢喜喜地下到了班组，当一个普通劳动者。开展革命大批判，向旧的习惯势力作斗争
    干部们下到了班组，精兵简政的工作是不是就完事了呢？
    电机厂革委会的同志们认为，这只是工作的开始，不是工作的终结。人到班组落了户，并不等于思想在群众中扎了根，要使下放人员真正在群众中扎根，还得做许多思想政治工作。
    一天，副主任常治中同志下班组劳动，看到有个下放的干部精神不够振作。通过谈心，了解到这个同志听到有人风言风语说他入党多年没有功劳也有苦劳，现在又去当工人，是没有出息的。他自己也觉得过去领导别人，而今是人家领导自己，面子过不去，思想结了疙瘩，工作老提不起精神。回到革委会，常治中同志把这个情况作了汇报，大家分析了一下原因，认为这是一种旧的习惯势力在作怪，是中国赫鲁晓夫的“入党做官”论的流毒还没有肃清。为彻底肃清流毒，更好地教育干部，革委会在驻厂毛泽东思想宣传队的协助下，办起了下放干部参加的毛泽东思想学习班。毛主席说：“我们党和国家的干部是普通劳动者，而不是骑在人民头上的老爷。”“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命”。干部们按照毛主席的教导，用毛泽东思想的照妖镜，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的“入党做官”论。革命的大批判大大提高了干部们的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。有的同志说得好：为人民服务，这是咱们考虑问题的出发点；置身于群众之中，当个普通劳动者，是咱们行动的立脚点；无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，是我们的归宿点。做好了这三“点”，才算是“一个有益于人民的人。”干部们满怀革命豪情，决心排除一切干扰，坚定地走毛主席指出的“精兵简政”大道。狠抓活思想，开展意识形态领域里的斗争
    通过开展革命大批判，下放的干部对一些流言蜚语顶得住了，脚跟站得稳了，在班组里工作安心了。但是，革委会的同志们并不以此为满足。他们认为，革命向前发展了，思想工作必须紧紧跟上发展的新形势。干部在班组里落了户，不能说思想工作就做到家了，要使他们人人成为思想革命化的带头人，还要做更多的工作才行。他们牢记毛主席“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节”的教导，继续不断地深入抓好下放干部的活思想，把精兵简政的工作做得好上加好。他们有时召开座谈会，了解下放干部的思想动态，有时听取群众意见，摸清下放干部的思想脉搏，对症下药。他们发现，有的同志下放到班组后，以为只要听从调动，好好干活就行了。因此，他们就只顾干活，忘记了宣传群众、带动群众更好地前进的重大责任。革委会的同志们抓住这个活思想，组织下放干部进行学习，重温毛主席关于“精兵简政”的最新指示，组织他们回忆过去劳动人民没有政权的痛苦，摆亿万革命群众从中国赫鲁晓夫手中夺回被他窃取的政权的艰难，看实行“精兵简政”，建设革命政权的深远意义，从而激发了大家的阶级感情，自觉地为巩固和发展新生的革命政权贡献力量。不少下放的干部深有感触地说：“咱们人在车间干活，心里可得装个地球，时时都要想到为三十亿人民服务。”
    此后，同志们身在车床边，心向北京城，自觉挑起革命生产两副重担，成了工人思想革命化的带头人。他们在班组带头活学活用毛泽东思想，大讲学习心得；带头批判中国赫鲁晓夫在工业战线上的修正主义路线，带头搞技术革新。原车间主任李应仁，到机修组当生产组长后，见小组里革命大批判开展得不够好，就主动找政治组长研究，出主意，想办法，把全组的革命大批判搞得轰轰烈烈。磨床坏了，他本着自力更生、勤俭办企业的精神，带领工人一起进行翻修，保证了生产的正常进行。不少下放的干部，都以自己的模范行动，得到了工人的信任和好评。工人们说，老的一茬干部朝前走，新的一茬干部随后跟，前辈人不脱离群众，后来人就有了榜样，我们劳动人民的江山就万代红了！
