The Soviet revisionist clique has once again sung praises for the puppet regime of Mobutu in the Congo (Zaire). A Soviet revisionist mouthpiece, *Tajik Communist*, published an article that fawned over him in the most nauseating manner.

Mobutu is a notorious reactionary who climbed onto the fake presidency of the Congo by stepping on the blood of the Congolese national hero Lumumba. He maintains his reactionary rule with the support of American bayonets. Yet, the Soviet revisionist traitors have the audacity to label this lackey of imperialism and agent of colonialism as a "hero" of anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism. Is there anything more absurd and shameless than this?

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "In this world, there is no love without a reason, nor is there any hatred without a reason."

The Soviet revisionist traitors' blatant praise for the traitor and butcher who is hated by the Congolese people can only once again prove: They are Mobutu's faithful friends, and therefore, they are also the vicious enemies of the Congolese people.

Soviet revisionist publications have repeatedly published articles to whitewash some reactionary regimes in Asian and African countries. This not only exposes the collusion between the Soviet revisionist clique and reactionaries around the world, but also reveals their collusion with U.S. imperialism. The reactionaries of various countries and U.S. imperialism are originally from the same nest. Since the Soviet revisionist clique is so intimate with U.S. imperialism, they naturally have to treat the darlings of U.S. imperialism as treasures.

In fact, the songs of praise sung by the Soviet revisionist clique for the likes of Mobutu are entirely in tune with those of U.S. imperialism. When U.S. Vice President Humphrey visited Kinshasa earlier this year, he referred to Mobutu as his "dear friend." The U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Palmer, during his "visit" to the Congo (Zaire) in June, also publicly boasted that the Mobutu puppet regime had made "progress" and that "its diplomatic activities have also been successful." Just a week later, Soviet revisionist publications published an article in response to Palmer's praise. Such close coordination is certainly not coincidental.

　　把痈疽当宝贝
    苏修叛徒集团最近又一次为刚果（金）的蒙博托傀儡政权大唱赞美诗。苏修的御用刊物《塔吉克共产党人》发表的一篇文章，对他进行极其肉麻的吹捧。
    蒙博托是个臭名远扬的反动派，他踏着刚果民族英雄卢蒙巴的血迹爬上了刚果伪总统的宝座，靠着美国刺刀维持自己的反动统治。然而，苏修叛徒竟然把这样一个帝国主义的忠实走狗、殖民主义者的代理人封之为反帝反殖民主义的“英雄”，难道还有比这个更荒唐、更无耻的吗？
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“世上决没有无缘无故的爱，也没有无缘无故的恨。”
    苏修叛徒对于被刚果（金）人民恨之入骨的卖国贼和刽子手进行这样露骨的吹捧，只能又一次地说明：他们是蒙博托的忠实朋友，因而也就是刚果（金）人民的凶恶敌人。
    苏修报刊几次三番发表文章为亚非国家的一些反动政权涂脂抹粉，这不仅表明苏修叛徒集团同各国反动派的勾结，而且也表明了他们同美帝国主义的狼狈为奸。各国反动派和美帝国主义本来就是一个窝里长的。既然苏修叛徒集团同美帝国主义打得火热，难解难分，他们当然也要把美帝国主义的宠儿当作宝贝来对待了。
    其实，苏修叛徒集团对蒙博托之流唱的赞歌，完全是美帝的调调。美国副总统汉弗莱在今年年初到金沙萨活动时，曾经把蒙博托称为“亲爱的朋友”。美国负责非洲事务的助理国务卿帕尔默在六月间“访问”刚果（金）时，也当众吹嘘蒙博托傀儡政权有“进步”，“它的外交活动也是成功的”。仅仅一个星期以后，苏修报刊就发表文章对帕尔默的吹捧加以呼应，这样密切的配合，岂是偶然的么？
