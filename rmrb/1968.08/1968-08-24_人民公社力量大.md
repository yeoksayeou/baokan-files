The power of the people's commune is great.

Last May, our area experienced a once-in-a-century hailstorm. The wheat that was about to ripen and the thriving young crops were all destroyed, and the fruit trees on the mountains were stripped bare. At this time, class enemies took the opportunity to sabotage and incite, saying, "This time it's all for nothing, don't bother eating." "Wait for the state to provide relief." The brigade cadres immediately stepped forward to organize all the poor and lower-middle peasants to study Chairman Mao's teachings on hard work and self-reliance, and to learn from the advanced examples of the people of Dazhai in overcoming disasters. They mobilized the masses to hold a big discussion on "What should we do in the face of the hailstorm?" Many poor and lower-middle peasants said:

"In 1963, Dazhai suffered such a severe flood, but they did not bow to the difficulties, did not rely on state relief, worked hard, and relied on their own efforts to achieve a good harvest using Mao Zedong Thought. We should follow Dazhai's example."

The battle to replant the crops began. Everyone treated the disaster relief front as a living classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. During the intense replanting, the army, government agencies, schools, and neighboring communes all actively came to support us. Although Shandongzhuang Commune also suffered from the disaster, they sent us 30,000 potato seedlings and dispatched labor to support us. In this way, we quickly completed the replanting of over 400 mu of land and also did a good job of field management. That year, not only did we achieve a bumper harvest, but we also increased production by 8,000 jin compared to the non-disaster year of 1966.

This incident vividly educated the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. A 60-something-year-old old poor peasant, Yan Fuli, said with tears in his eyes: "I remember one year when we also suffered from a hailstorm, the crops could not be planted, and the landlords and rich peasants took advantage of the situation to lend money at high interest. Although we suffered the same hailstorm, the results were completely different. This is the victory of the people's commune, the victory of the Dazhai spirit."

Over the past ten years of communalization, our brigade has firmly taken the road of hard work and self-reliance, and agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry have all developed greatly. The yield per mu of land has increased from 200 jin before communalization to over 500 jin. In the past, we had to rely on state grain every year, but now we not only achieve self-sufficiency but also sell grain to the state, and the brigade has a considerable amount of reserve grain. We have planted thousands of mu of trees, and the bare mountains have grown into patches of green forests. The yield of fruit trees has doubled. The number of large livestock has also increased significantly. The income of the commune members is now more than double what it was before communalization, and many households have built new houses, with significant improvements and advancements in their lives.

    人民公社力量大。
    去年五月份，我们这里发生了百年不遇的大雹灾。将要成熟的小麦和长得茁壮的青苗全被砸毁了，山上的果树也被砸成了光杆。这时阶级敌人趁机破坏，背后挑动说：“这下子白干了，别吃饭了。”“等着国家给救济吧。”大队干部立即站出来组织全体贫下中农社员学习了毛主席有关艰苦奋斗、自力更生的教导，学习了大寨人战胜灾害的先进事迹，发动群众开展了“在雹灾面前怎么办？”的大讨论。不少贫下中农说：
  “人家大寨一九六三年遭受那么大的水灾，都不向困难低头，不要国家救济，艰苦奋斗，自力更生，用毛泽东思想夺得好收成，我们要照大寨那个法子干。”
    重新抢种的战斗打响了，大家把抗灾战场作为活学活用毛主席著作的大课堂。在抢种紧张的时候，解放军、机关、学校、兄弟社队都积极来支援。山东庄公社虽然也受了灾，还给我们送来了三万棵白薯秧，并抽出劳力来支援。这样，我们很快地完成了四百多亩的抢种任务，又做好了田间管理。这一年不但夺得了丰收，比不受灾的一九六六年还增产八千斤。
    这个事，活生生地教育了广大贫下中农。六十多岁的老贫农社员阎福利流着眼泪说：“记得有一年也是受雹灾，庄稼种不上，地主富农还趁火打劫，放高利贷。同样受了雹灾，结果却是两个样。这是人民公社的胜利，是大寨精神的胜利。”
    公社化的十年来，我们这个队由于坚决走艰苦奋斗、自力更生的道路，农、林、牧各业大发展。每亩地产粮由公社化以前的二百斤提高到五百多斤。过去每年都要吃国家粮食，现在不但自给，还卖给国家，队里还有不少储备粮。植树造林上千亩，秃山上长起了一片片的绿林，果树产量提高了两倍。大牲畜也有不少的增加。社员的收入现在比公社化前增加了一倍多，不少的户盖上了新房，生活有了很大的改善和提高。
