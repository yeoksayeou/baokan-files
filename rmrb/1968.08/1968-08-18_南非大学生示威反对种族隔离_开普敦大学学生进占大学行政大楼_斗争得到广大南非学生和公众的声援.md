South African students have been protesting against apartheid, with students from the University of Cape Town occupying the university's administrative building. Their struggle has received widespread support from students and the public across South Africa.

New China News Agency, August 17th: Cape Town - Students at the University of Cape Town began protests on the 14th, opposing the South African apartheid government's decision to bar an African from becoming a lecturer at the university. The students' just struggle against apartheid has received strong support from students in other parts of South Africa.

The protests began after the South African government announced its opposition to the appointment of African Ashby Mfengu as the main lecturer in the Department of Social Anthropology at the University of Cape Town. On the morning of the 14th, about 300 students from the University of Cape Town sang "We Shall Overcome" as they occupied the university's administrative building and began a sit-in protest. The protesting students announced that they would not stop their struggle if their demands were not met. By the 15th, the number of students participating in the sit-in protest had increased to about 600, and 1,300 students signed in support of the struggle that day. By the night of the 16th, approximately 200 faculty members, including professors and lecturers, had also joined the students' sit-in protest. The head of the university's arts department even resigned in protest against the South African government's unreasonable decision.

The University of Cape Town students' struggle against the South African government's apartheid policy has received widespread support from students and the public across South Africa. Over the past few days, they have continuously received telegrams and letters supporting their struggle.

Students at the most important university in South Africa, the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, sent a telegram to the protesting students in Cape Town, encouraging them to continue their struggle. They also actively organized support protests and rallies, despite threats and warnings from the South African government. A student leader from the University of the Witwatersrand said on the 16th, "Students from the University of Cape Town, the University of the Witwatersrand, and other universities must fearlessly fight for what they believe is just and right."

Under the impact of the student protest wave, South African Prime Minister Vorster publicly appeared on the 16th, defaming the students' just struggle as "riots" that "cannot be tolerated," threatening to take repressive measures against the students. However, the students ignored his threats and continued their struggle. The chancellor of the University of the Witwatersrand issued a statement on the 17th, opposing the Vorster government's pressure on the university.

The appearance of anti-apartheid protest actions in the progressive student movement in South Africa is the first of its kind. This reflects the deepening struggle of the broad masses of white and black South Africans against the government's apartheid policy. At the end of June this year, influenced by the progressive student movement in Western Europe, one of the few multiracial groups in South Africa, mainly composed of English-speaking university students, the National Union of South African Students, passed a resolution expressing opposition to the apartheid policy pursued by the South African government.

    南非大学生示威反对种族隔离
    开普敦大学学生进占大学行政大楼　斗争得到广大南非学生和公众的声援
    新华社十七日讯　开普敦消息：南非开普敦大学学生从十四日开始举行示威，抗议南非种族主义当局禁止一名非洲人担任这个大学讲师的决定。开普敦大学学生反对种族隔离的正义斗争，得到了南非其他地方大学生的坚决支持。
    这次抗议示威是在南非当局宣布反对任命非洲人阿希·马费耶为开普敦大学人类社会学系的主要讲师之后开始的。十四日上午，开普敦大学的三百名学生唱着《我们将得胜》的歌曲，进占了大学的行政大楼，并开始举行静坐示威。示威学生宣布，若他们的要求得不到满足，他们就不停止斗争。到十五日，参加静坐示威的学生增加到约六百人，当天有一千三百名学生签名支持这次斗争。在十六日深夜，大约有二百名教职员，包括教授和讲师，也参加了学生的静坐示威。这所大学的艺术系主任还用辞职来表示抗议南非当局的无理决定。
    开普敦大学学生反对南非当局种族隔离政策的斗争，得到广大的南非学生和公众的声援。几天来，他们不断收到支持他们这次斗争的电报和信件。
    在约翰内斯堡的南非最重要的大学——韦特瓦特斯兰德大学的学生，打电报给开普敦大学示威学生，鼓励他们继续斗争。他们还不顾南非当局的威胁和警告，积极组织声援示威和集会。韦特瓦特斯兰德大学的一位学生负责人十六日发表公开谈话说：“开普敦大学、韦特瓦特斯兰德大学以及其他大学的学生要为他们认为是正义和正确的事业而毫不畏惧地进行战斗。”
    在学生抗议浪潮的冲击下，南非总理沃斯特在十六日公开出面，污蔑学生的正义斗争是“骚乱”，“不能容忍”，威胁要对学生采取镇压措施。但是，学生们不理睬他的那一套恫吓，继续坚持斗争。韦特瓦特斯兰德大学校长在十七日发表声明，反对沃斯特政府对大学施加压力。
    南非进步学生运动中出现反对种族隔离的示威行动，这还是第一次。这反映广大南非白人与黑人一起反对当局的种族隔离政策的斗争，正在深入发展。今年六月底，在西欧进步学生运动的影响下，南非的少数几个多种族团体之一、主要由英语大学学生组成的南非全国学生联合会，曾通过一项决议，表示反对南非当局奉行的种族隔离政策。
