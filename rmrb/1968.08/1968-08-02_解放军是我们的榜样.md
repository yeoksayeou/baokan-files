In the midst of the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we are filled with revolutionary fervor and joyfully celebrate the 41st anniversary of the founding of the great People's Liberation Army of China. It is a double joy, and our hearts are filled with indescribable happiness. On this day of great rejoicing, we repeatedly shout: Learn from the PLA! Salute the PLA! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years of long life to Chairman Mao!

The People's Liberation Army of China is the great people's army personally founded and led by Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin. It is the strong pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the iron wall defending our socialist motherland, and the steadfast support of the revolutionary masses and the broad poor and lower-middle peasants. The PLA and we poor and lower-middle peasants are heart to heart; they are the children of the working people. During the War of Resistance against Japan, the Japanese devils carried out the inhuman "three alls" policy. Once, they massacred more than ten of our poor and lower-middle peasants in our cave dwellings in Xigou. Fortunately, the heroic Eighth Route Army defeated the Japanese devils and won the great victory of the War of Resistance against Japan, so we poor and lower-middle peasants no longer suffered from the Japanese devils. During the War of Liberation, the reactionary Kuomintang of Chiang Kai-shek launched a frenzied civil war. Again, it was our People's Liberation Army that defeated hundreds of thousands of Kuomintang bandits and won the victory of the War of Liberation. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the PLA helped us overthrow the feudal landlords, overthrow the feudal exploitative system, and liberate us poor and lower-middle peasants and the people of the whole country, enabling us to stand up, take power, and become the masters of the state. In the period of socialist revolution and socialist construction, the People's Liberation Army has established immortal merits.

In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the People's Liberation Army resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's call to "support the broad masses of the left," standing firmly and clearly supporting the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. At the critical moment of the great struggle between the two classes and the two lines, the People's Liberation Army, carrying the instructions of Chairman Mao and the Central Committee, came to the Jin Dongnan region to support the left. They held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, propagated, implemented, and comprehensively carried out Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and vigorously helped the revolutionary masses of the proletariat hold various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, promoting revolutionary great unity and consolidating revolutionary "three-in-one" combinations. The revolution is thriving, and production is booming, presenting a great situation everywhere. Under the radiance of Mao Zedong Thought and with the strong support of the PLA support troops, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the Jin Dongnan region is advancing victoriously along the course charted by Chairman Mao!

The living facts of revolutionary struggle fully prove the great teaching of our great leader Chairman Mao that "without a people's army, the people have nothing." This is an indisputable revolutionary truth. "The unity of the army and the people is like one person; see who can defeat us?" In class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, we poor and lower-middle peasants have established a revolutionary sentiment of flesh and blood and fish and water with the People's Liberation Army. We must cherish the PLA as we cherish our own eyes, support the PLA, help the PLA, and defend our country's great wall to the death, forever being models of supporting the army and caring for military families.

"Learn from the People's Liberation Army throughout the country," this is the great call issued by our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao to the people of the whole country and to us broad poor and lower-middle peasants. We must take the PLA as our model, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, and focus on the "application" to turn Mao Zedong Thought into our souls. We must be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. At present, we must further hold various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, carry out in-depth revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois "self," and establish the proletarian "public," comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, take the initiative to attack the class enemies, do a good job in cleaning up the class ranks and streamlining the bureaucracy, and consolidate and develop the newly born revolutionary committees.

Under the guidance of the great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" by our great leader Chairman Mao, and with the help of the PLA, we have overcome numerous difficulties, conquered severe droughts, and achieved a bumper harvest of summer wheat. The autumn crops are growing well. Now, we are strengthening the management of autumn crops and fighting against various natural disasters, determined to achieve an overall bumper harvest in agriculture this year.

On the occasion of commemorating the August 1st Army Day, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Xigou Brigade have decided to take the People's Liberation Army as our model, learn from the People's Liberation Army, and in the march to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, in the fierce struggle of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and in the struggle against nature, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, achieve new feats, and set new examples.

　　解放军是我们的榜样
　　李顺达
    在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，我们满怀革命激情，热烈庆祝伟大的中国人民解放军建军四十一周年，真是喜上加喜，心里有说不出的高兴。在这大喜大庆的日子里，我们一遍又一遍地高呼：向解放军学习！向解放军致敬！毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！
    中国人民解放军是毛主席亲手缔造和领导、林副主席直接指挥的伟大的人民军队，是无产阶级专政的强大柱石，是保卫社会主义祖国的钢铁长城，是无产阶级革命派和广大贫下中农的坚强靠山。解放军和我们贫下中农心贴心，是我们劳动人民的子弟兵。抗日战争时期，日本鬼子实行惨无人道的“三光”政策，有一次，就在我们西沟窑洞里残杀了十多个贫下中农。多亏英雄的八路军打败了日本鬼子，取得了抗日战争的伟大胜利，我们贫下中农才不再受鬼子的害。解放战争时期，蒋介石国民党反动派，发动了疯狂的内战。又是我们的人民解放军打败了几百万蒋匪军，取得了解放战争的胜利。在共产党的领导下，解放军帮助我们打倒了封建地主，推翻了封建剥削制度，使我们贫下中农和全国人民翻身得解放，当了家，掌了权，做了国家主人。在社会主义革命和社会主义建设时期，人民解放军都建立了不朽的功勋。
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，人民解放军坚决响应毛主席“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号召，立场坚定，旗帜鲜明地积极支持了无产阶级革命派。在两个阶级、两条路线大搏斗的关键时刻，人民解放军带着毛主席和党中央的指示，来晋东南地区支左。他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，宣传贯彻和全面落实毛主席的最新指示，大力帮助无产阶级革命派举办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，促进了革命的大联合，巩固了革命的“三结合”，革命轰轰烈烈，生产蒸蒸日上，到处呈现出一派大好形势。在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在人民解放军支左部队的大力支持下，我们晋东南地区的无产阶级文化大革命正沿着毛主席所指引的航向乘胜前进！
    革命斗争的活生生事实，充分证实了我们伟大领袖毛主席“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切”的伟大教导，是千真万确的革命真理。“军民团结如一人，试看天下谁能敌？”我们贫下中农在阶级斗争和两条路线斗争中，和人民解放军建立了血肉相联、鱼水相依的无产阶级革命感情。我们要象爱护自己的眼睛一样地爱护解放军，支持解放军，帮助解放军，誓死保卫我们祖国的伟大长城，永做拥军优属的模范。
      “全国学人民解放军”，这是我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席向全国人民和我们广大贫下中农发出的伟大号召。我们一定要以解放军为榜样，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫，把毛泽东思想化为自己的灵魂，无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的革命路线。当前，我们要进一步办好各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，深入开展革命大批判，大破资产阶级的“私”字，大立无产阶级的“公”字，全面落实毛主席一系列最新指示，主动向阶级敌人进攻，搞好清理阶级队伍和精兵简政工作，巩固和发展新生的革命委员会。
    在伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针指引下，在解放军的帮助下，我们已经克服了重重困难，战胜了严重的旱灾，取得了夏季小麦丰收，秋禾长势良好。现在，我们正加强秋田管理，同各种自然灾害作斗争，誓夺今年农业生产全面丰收。
    在纪念“八一”建军节的日子里，我们西沟大队的贫下中农，决心以人民解放军为榜样，向人民解放军学习，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的征途中，在阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的激烈斗争中，在同大自然的斗争中，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，建新功，立新劳。
