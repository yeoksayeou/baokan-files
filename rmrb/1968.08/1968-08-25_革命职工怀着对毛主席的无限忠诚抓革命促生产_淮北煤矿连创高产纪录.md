Revolutionary workers at Huabei Coal Mine, with unlimited loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, are vigorously grasping the revolution and promoting production. The revolutionary situation in the entire mine is getting better and better, and production is booming. Since this year, they have continuously created new high production records for coal, breaking the highest daily coal production level in the ten years since the mine was established. The great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin's two receptions of the representatives attending the national coal industry front's grasp the revolution and promote production conference have given the revolutionary workers of the entire mine great encouragement and added boundless strength to them. The original coal production of the entire mine in mid-August increased by 34 percent compared to the beginning of the month, and the total advance of excavation increased by 50 percent.

The broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat at Huabei Coal Mine have, in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, greatly heightened their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. They regard the implementation of Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp the revolution and promote production" as an important sign of being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, take the initiative to launch a fierce attack on the class enemy, and deeply carry out the great criticism of the revolution, further sweeping away the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods spread by China's Khrushchev and his agents such as "reward money as the commander" and "exploitation is a merit," further heightening their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and guaranteeing the great development of production.

    革命职工怀着对毛主席的无限忠诚抓革命促生产
    淮北煤矿连创高产纪录
    淮北煤矿广大革命职工怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠诚，狠抓革命，猛促生产，全矿革命形势越来越好，生产蒸蒸日上。今年以来，他们连续创造了煤炭高产新纪录，突破了建矿十年来的最高原煤日产水平。伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席两次接见出席全国煤炭工业战线抓革命促生产会议的代表，更给全矿革命职工以极大鼓舞，给他们增添了无穷的力量。全矿原煤产量八月中旬比上旬提高了百分之三十四，掘进总进尺提高了百分之五十。
    淮北煤矿广大无产阶级革命派，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟大大提高，他们把贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，看作是无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席革命路线的重要标志。他们发扬无产阶级的彻底革命精神，主动地向阶级敌人发起猛烈进攻，深入地开展革命大批判，进一步肃清中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人所散布的“奖金挂帅”、“剥削有功”等反革命修正主义黑货，进一步提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，保证了生产的大发展。
