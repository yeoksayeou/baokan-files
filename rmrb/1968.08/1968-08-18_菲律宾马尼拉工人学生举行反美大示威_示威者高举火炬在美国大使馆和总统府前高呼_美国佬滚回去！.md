About a thousand workers and students in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, held a powerful protest in front of the U.S. Embassy and the Presidential Palace on the evening of the 16th, carrying torches and banners with anti-U.S. slogans. They strongly condemned U.S. imperialism's aggressive policies in Asia, demanding that the U.S. withdraw its military bases from the Philippines and that U.S. aggressor troops withdraw from Vietnam.

The protesters also demanded the abolition of the so-called "Equal Rights Law," which allows U.S. monopolistic capital to plunder Philippine resources at will, and condemned the reactionary Philippine government for acting as a lackey of U.S. imperialism.

The demonstrators chanted slogans such as "Yankees go home!" "Johnson, the bloody murderer!" "Long live the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam!" and so on.

When the workers and students were demonstrating in front of the U.S. Embassy, the reactionary Philippine government dispatched police to brutally suppress the protest, even opening fire on the demonstrators. The protesters bravely retaliated with torches and banners, then regrouped in front of the U.S. Embassy, chanting anti-U.S. slogans. They also went to the police station to protest the arrest of demonstrators.

Previously, hundreds of students in Manila had held an anti-U.S. protest on July 30th.

The series of protests by the Philippine people occurred as the U.S. recently intensified its use of military bases in the Philippines to invade Vietnam.

According to Philippine newspapers, U.S. imperialism has recently strengthened its air force at Clark Air Base in the Philippines and is expanding its air base in the central Philippine region of Macatan. U.S. warships invading Vietnam frequently enter and exit the U.S. naval bases in Subic Bay and Sangley Point. In addition to urging the Philippine government to send more mercenary troops, the U.S. recently openly sent "recruitment teams" to Sangley Point to recruit Filipinos to serve as cannon fodder in the invasion of Vietnam.

The broad masses of the Philippine people are increasingly strongly resisting U.S. aggression and control, resolutely opposing the Philippine government's continued implementation of the reactionary policy of following the U.S. in invading Vietnam.

    菲律宾马尼拉工人学生举行反美大示威
    示威者高举火炬在美国大使馆和总统府前高呼“美国佬滚回去！”
    新华社十六日讯　马尼拉消息：菲律宾首都马尼拉的工人和学生约一千人，十六日晚上高举火炬和写有反美口号的标语牌，在美国驻菲律宾大使馆和菲律宾总统府门前举行强大的示威，强烈谴责美帝国主义在亚洲推行侵略政策，要求美帝撤除它在菲律宾的军事基地，要求美国侵略军撤出越南。
    示威者还要求废除让美国垄断资本任意掠夺菲律宾资源的所谓“平等权利法”，谴责菲律宾反动当局充当美帝国主义仆从的行径。
    示威群众高呼：“美国佬滚回去！”“约翰逊，血腥的杀人凶手！”“越南南方民族解放阵线万岁！”等口号。
    当工人和学生在美国大使馆门前示威时，菲律宾反动当局派出警察进行疯狂的镇压，甚至向示威群众开枪射击。示威者英勇地用火炬和标语牌回击反动警察，随后又集结在美国大使馆前，高呼反美口号。他们还到警察署前抗议反动当局逮捕示威群众。
    在这以前，马尼拉的数百名学生曾在七月三十日举行了反美示威。
    菲律宾人民的一系列示威，是在美帝最近以来加紧利用它在菲律宾的军事基地侵略越南的时候发生的。
    据菲律宾报纸透露，美帝国主义最近增强了它在菲律宾克拉克基地的空军，并且正在扩充它设在菲律宾中部马克坦的空军基地。美国侵略越南的舰只频繁地进出设在苏比克湾和桑莱岬的美国海军基地。美帝除了催促菲律宾当局增派帮凶军外，最近还公然派出“招兵队”在桑莱岬附近招募菲律宾人充当侵越炮灰。
    菲律宾广大人民正在日益强烈地反抗美帝的侵略和控制，坚决反对菲律宾当局继续执行追随美帝侵略越南的反动政策。
