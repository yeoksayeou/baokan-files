The red flags fluttered, and the cheers echoed through Tsinghua Garden. The east wind brought good news, and the victory songs soared into the sky.

Our great leader Chairman Mao! The joyous news of the precious gift of mangoes you sent to the Capital Workers and Peasants Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team in Tsinghua Garden spread far and wide. The revolutionary masses of the capital, with hearts aflame, streamed into Tsinghua Garden to share the joy. Look! The revolutionary fighters of the Capital Workers and Peasants Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team and the Red Guards welcomed the revolutionary masses with enthusiasm. Everyone congratulated each other, encouraged each other, and shared this boundless happiness and joy.

In the central square of Tsinghua Garden, a red table was set up, on which golden, fragrant mangoes were placed. This precious gift attracted countless eager gazes. People looked and looked, reluctant to leave. Dear Chairman Mao! People did not just look with their eyes, but with their hearts. From these mangoes, people saw the invincible Mao Zedong Thought you sent. People took your care as the driving force to advance, to seize the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution, and to write a new chapter in the annals of the proletarian revolution!

Chairman Mao and Our Hearts Are United

Our great leader Chairman Mao always has our hearts united. Chairman Mao always remembers the revolutionary people, and the revolutionary people always remember Chairman Mao.

When our great leader Chairman Mao sent the precious gift of mangoes to the Capital Workers and Peasants Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, the team was also preparing for a major joyous event.

It turned out that when the propaganda team arrived in Tsinghua Garden to enthusiastically propagate and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, they achieved great success. The broad masses of revolutionary peasants in Jushan Farm specially picked two baskets of fresh peaches to comfort the fighters of the propaganda team. When these fighters received the peaches, no one wanted to eat them. They thought of the sick comrades in the brother unit and voluntarily sent them the peaches. The sick comrades in the brother unit received this gift and held it in their hands, reluctant to eat. They thought: The comrades on the front line of propaganda are more hardworking than us. To enable them to better propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions, we should let them eat. The peaches were passed to the comrades on the front line of propaganda. These comrades, how could they bear to eat them? “They should be sent to the unit that works the hardest, so they can better propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions.” The comrades of each unit unanimously passed the peaches to the Fourth Unit. The comrades of the Fourth Unit received this gift and were particularly moved. They said, these are not ordinary peaches; they embody the profound fraternal feelings of mutual care and support among the Capital Workers and Peasants Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team in the midst of battle. We should present our sincere hearts, determined to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and propagate Mao Zedong Thought, to our great leader Chairman Mao.

The entire Fourth Unit Propaganda Team carefully selected eight fresh peaches and neatly arranged them on a red tray, writing eight golden words: "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life!"

The actions of the comrades of the Fourth Unit immediately received the approval and support of the comrades of other units. Everyone decided to quickly send the peaches to Zhongnanhai to present to our great leader Chairman Mao. Just at this moment, the joyous news of Chairman Mao sending precious gifts arrived from Zhongnanhai to Tsinghua Garden. Tsinghua Garden was in an uproar. The propaganda team fighters, ready to depart, said excitedly: Chairman Mao remembers us, and we think of Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao and we truly have our hearts united! Their faces were streaked with tears of happiness, looking up at the lights of Zhongnanhai, they unanimously shouted: Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao! The cheers merged into a powerful wave, echoing through the night sky of the capital.

The night was already deep, and the rain was falling. But the comrades said: Even if it were raining knives, it could not stop us from expressing our loyalty to Chairman Mao! They selected 240 representatives to brave the rain and send the longevity peaches to Zhongnanhai.

At this very moment, the joyous news of Chairman Mao sending precious gifts was first broadcast from the airwaves to the factories, schools, and the hearts of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the capital.

Father and Mother Are Not as Dear as Chairman Mao

The great leader Chairman Mao sending mangoes to the Capital Workers and Peasants Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team greatly inspired the working class and the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in the capital. They all expressed their determination to forever follow Chairman Mao and forever be loyal to Chairman Mao.

At nine o'clock in the evening, the news of Chairman Mao sending mangoes to the Capital Workers and Peasants Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team had just been broadcast from the loudspeakers. Huang Jinsheng's heart immediately flew to Chairman Mao. When he saw the precious gift, a warm current of happiness surged through his heart. He was so moved that he shed tears of joy and raised his hands, shouting: Long, long live Chairman Mao!

Huang Jinsheng, a gas welder from the Beijing Gear Factory, stood in front of the mangoes and was reminded of the past. He is thirty-six years old, having lived exactly eighteen years in the old society and eighteen years in the new society. He thought, what a stark contrast these two eighteen-year periods are!

Thirty-six years ago, Huang Jinsheng was born into the hell of the old society. His father was a rickshaw puller who bent over all day, earning barely a few coins. The family of six lived a life of hardship, eating bitter vegetables and bean pulp to fill their stomachs. At the age of twelve, Huang Jinsheng was forced to carry a broken basket to pick up scraps, becoming emaciated and skinny. When he was starving, he would go to the rich people's drains to dig out rice from the pots. Chairman Mao said, "Never forget class struggle." The eighteen years in the old society left Huang Jinsheng with endless hatred; how could he forget?

In 1949, Beijing was liberated, and Huang Jinsheng was reborn. He became a worker, and his life improved. Now, his family also has six people, his wife is a lathe operator, and the children are in school. He thought: This is truly a new world!

Huang Jinsheng, this propagandist of Mao Zedong Thought, propagated Mao Zedong Thought in Tsinghua Garden, braving wind and rain, fearing neither hardship nor fatigue. After comparing the two eighteen-year periods before and after liberation, his love for Chairman Mao deepened. He thought, only Chairman Mao is the great savior of the poor! Only Chairman Mao will be with us heart to heart! We must forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, and Chairman Mao will forever be the red sun in our hearts. He stood in front of Chairman Mao's portrait and expressed his determination: We must, under the command of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, together with the revolutionary Red Guards, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, unify our will, unify our steps, and unify our actions. We must thoroughly criticize the reactionary "multi-center theory" of the bourgeoisie. We vow to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, to fight for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and to die for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

"The most resonant song is 'The East Is Red,' and the greatest leader is Mao Zedong..." Beijing Second General Machinery Factory old worker and Communist Party member Yao Defu listened to this stirring song, looking at the precious gift of mangoes sent by Chairman Mao, and a boundless red sun rose in his heart. Red sun, red sun! It is you who brought light to our family, and it is you who illuminated the path to revolutionary victory. He was overcome with joyful tears, and his thoughts surged.

Yao Defu was born into a hardworking worker's family. His father worked for the capitalists from a young age and was eventually driven to death by the capitalists. His sister was sold to someone else, and his mother worked as a wet nurse for years. He himself started working as a slave under the capitalist's whip at the age of thirteen. After liberation, he became the master of his own home. During the Cultural Revolution, he fought alongside the broad masses of the proletarian revolutionaries against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party led by China's Khrushchev, defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. This time, he participated in the Capital Workers and Peasants Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team. All this, he had never even dreamed of!

Yao Defu's heart could no longer be calm. He immediately took out his pen, preparing to write down his loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao. However, due to his low cultural level, he wrote and rewrote, unable to fully express his deep affection for Chairman Mao. Some comrades saw him struggling so hard and said, "Old Yao, let me help you write." He firmly replied, "No! I must use my own pen and my own words to express my boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao and my determination to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment." Mao Zedong Thought gave him boundless strength. He wrote and wrote, continuing until late into the night, around three o'clock in the morning, finally succeeding. His face lit up with a happy smile, and he softly sang his favorite song: "The greatest love is the Party's, father and mother are not as dear as Chairman Mao..."

Follow Chairman Mao to Make Revolution

The working class loves Mao Zedong Thought and is most enthusiastic about propagating Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao sent mangoes, bringing Mao Zedong Thought and an atomic bomb of spiritual power to the working class of the capital. They love Mao Zedong Thought even more and propagate it with even greater enthusiasm.

The Beijing People's Printing Factory Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team is about to set out for Tsinghua Garden. They want to print propaganda materials for Mao Zedong Thought as quickly as possible. This news spread to the typesetting room, and everyone unanimously said, "Loyalty is shown through action. No matter how great the difficulty, it cannot surpass our enthusiasm for propagating Mao Zedong Thought." Those who should be off work did not leave, and those who should be resting did not rest. Everyone decided to complete the task in the shortest time possible.

Under normal circumstances, they would follow the original manuscript to enlarge and print, which would take twenty-four hours to produce the finished product. If they wrote on sulfuric acid paper and then printed, it would also take more than ten hours. But time was running out, what should they do?

The typesetting workers Tian Tiecheng, Fu Zongzhi, Duan Youquan, and others followed Chairman Mao's teachings, "Humanity must constantly summarize experience, make discoveries, inventions, creations, and progress." They dared to think and act, breaking old frameworks and daring to innovate. After research, they adopted the method of directly writing with ink on lead foil photosensitive film. As a result, it only took three and a half hours from typesetting to producing the finished product, successfully completing the task. Worker Tian Tiecheng excitedly said, "What was difficult to do today was done. Why? Because we love Mao Zedong Thought!" He saw the gift sent by Chairman Mao and decided to make greater efforts to learn and propagate Mao Zedong Thought together with the revolutionary Red Guards and revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of Tsinghua University.

The comrades of the Beijing Standard Parts Factory No. 2 Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team in Tsinghua heard the joyous news of Chairman Mao sending mangoes and were all moved to tears of joy, jumping with excitement. To let more people share this greatest happiness, they printed leaflets with this joyous news throughout the night. The workers said excitedly, "These are not ordinary mangoes, but dew and sunlight. We must spread this news to the hearts of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers." The entire class of ten people, with hearts red with loyalty to Chairman Mao, threw themselves into this battle.

By one o'clock in the morning, they had printed more than a thousand leaflets. At this time, the class leader proposed to everyone, "We must walk one step, red one line; live one place, red one piece. Wherever we go, we spread the joyous news there, and wherever we go, we propagate Mao Zedong Thought there." To quickly deliver this joyous news to the hearts of the revolutionary masses, they braved the rain and left Tsinghua Garden at night. They fearlessly faced difficulties and fatigue, going wherever there were people and rushing wherever there was light. They delivered this joyous news to factories, offices, schools, hospitals, and to sanitation workers, milkmen, and tricycle workers.

After walking for more than three hours, they arrived at their own factory and delivered the joyous news to the hearts of everyone. They expressed their feelings with these lines of poetry: "Each mango is a deep bond of love, Chairman Mao and we have our hearts united. The joyous news spreads everywhere, following Chairman Mao to make revolution!"

To Let Future Generations Forever Remember Chairman Mao's Greatest Concern

To let future generations forever remember Chairman Mao's greatest concern and plant deep roots of Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary masses thought of every possible way to preserve the precious gift of mangoes sent by Chairman Mao. Look, what a moving scene!

At eleven o'clock on the night of August 5, the celebration meeting of the Beijing People's Printing Factory had just ended. At this time, everyone discussed, "We must pass down Chairman Mao's precious gift, let our descendants forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, and definitely preserve it well."

At this time, more than twenty comrades from the medical office all unanimously offered suggestions to the revolutionary committee. They said, to preserve the mangoes for a long time, we must find a preservative for plant specimens. How to do it? Someone suggested: The Beijing Agricultural Exhibition Hall might have such a preservative. Broadcaster Tie Bing heard that there was one, and her heart bloomed with joy. She jumped and ran to the drivers' dormitory. The driver comrade had just returned from driving and was about to sleep. But when he heard that this important task had to be completed, he immediately got up, braved the rain, and drove straight to the Beijing Agricultural Exhibition Hall. Upon arrival, they found out that there was no such preservative.

It was already around three o'clock in the morning, and the rain was still pouring, quite cold. Li Shujing, who went with everyone, was wearing a short-sleeved shirt. She carefully held the bottle containing the mangoes in her arms. Tie Bing asked her, "Are you cold?" She smiled and said, "Holding Chairman Mao's gift, I am not cold at all."

Everyone discussed again and decided to go to the Natural History Museum. Because they often preserve plant specimens there, they might have a solution. The car arrived there just as it was getting light. They knocked on the door and entered, hearing that there was such a preservative, everyone jumped with joy.

The problem of long-term preservation of the mangoes was solved, and the carpenters did not even eat, rushing to make a tall glass case and placing the mangoes inside. The workers said, "Preserving the mangoes is a big deal. We must preserve it well and let Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line be forever engraved in our hearts."

Now let's look at the poor and lower-middle peasants of Jushan Farm! They decided to transplant the mangoes to the north.

The meeting to welcome the mangoes at Jushan Farm ended, and Liu Shuxia, a comrade from the Fruit Tree Team, and all the poor and lower-middle peasants stood on the stage for a long time, unwilling to leave. She walked with deep emotion to the place where the mangoes were placed, and she bent down to smell the fragrant mangoes; she looked up at Chairman Mao's portrait, and her face glowed with happiness. She seemed to have discovered a new problem, turning around, she ran back to the dormitory, rummaging through boxes and drawers, finally finding the book she was looking for. She found the section describing mangoes and read it aloud. She was immersed in a happy and beautiful wish.

What was Liu Shuxia thinking? It turned out that she decided to experiment with transplanting mangoes to Jushan Farm. She said, "I am in charge of the fruit trees. Today, Chairman Mao sent the mangoes given to him by foreign friends to us poor and lower-middle peasants. This is Chairman Mao's greatest concern, greatest encouragement, and greatest motivation for us! I want to cultivate mangoes in Jushan Farm with my own hands, so that the broad poor and lower-middle peasants can see the mangoes and think of our beloved Chairman Mao, and let Chairman Mao's mangoes forever bloom in the hearts of the poor and lower-middle peasants of Jushan Farm." Liu Shuxia's initiative received the firm support of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants. She had the confidence to carry out this experiment.

The revolutionary Red Guards and revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of Tsinghua University also expressed their determination to learn from the workers and peasants, planting deep roots of Mao Zedong Thought in their minds.

Great leader Chairman Mao, the red sun in our hearts! We saw the mangoes and thought of your instructions, reminders, and hopes! We are determined to follow your great strategic deployment, fully implement your latest instructions, and carry the Cultural Revolution to the end!

　　颗颗芒果恩情深　心心向着红太阳
　　——毛主席赠送珍贵礼物的特大喜讯传开以后
    清华园里，红旗飞舞，欢声雷动，东风传喜报，凯歌入云霄。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席啊！您送给在清华园的首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队的礼物芒果的特大喜讯，传遍了四面八方。首都广大革命群众，怀着颗颗红心，络绎不绝，前来清华园报喜。看吧！首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队的革命战士和红卫兵小将，热烈迎接广大革命群众，大家互相祝贺，互相勉励，共同分享这无比的幸福和欢乐。
    在清华园正中的广场上，陈设着一张红色的案桌，上面放着黄澄澄、香喷喷的芒果。这珍贵的礼物，吸引着千万道热烈的眼光。人们前看后看，流连忘返。敬爱的毛主席啊！人们不只是用眼睛去看，而是用心灵去看。从这个芒果上，人们看到了您送来了战无不胜的毛泽东思想。人们把您的关怀，当着鼓舞自己前进的力量，去夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，在无产阶级革命的史册上谱写崭新的篇章！
　　毛主席和我们心连心
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席，永远同我们心连心。毛主席时刻惦记着革命人民，革命人民也时刻想念着毛主席。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席把珍贵礼物芒果送给首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队的时候，首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队，也正在筹备一件大喜事。
    原来，宣传队到清华园热情宣传和坚决落实毛主席的最新指示取得了很大成绩时，首都广大革命群众个个欢欣鼓舞。巨山农场的广大贫下中农，还特意采摘了两筐新鲜的桃子，慰劳本场宣传队的战士。当这些战士拿到桃子后，谁也舍不得吃。他们想到兄弟团的病号，就主动地送了去。兄弟团的病号拿到这份礼物后，捧在手里，也舍不得吃。他们想：站在宣传第一线的战士比我们辛苦，为了使他们更好地宣传毛主席最新指示，应该让他们吃。桃子转到了站在宣传第一线的战士手中，这些战士怎么舍得吃掉它呢？“应该送给工作最辛苦的团，使他们更好地宣传毛主席最新指示。”各团战士不约而同地将桃子又转送到了四团。四团的战士拿到这份礼物后，心情格外激动。他们说，这不是普通的桃子，它凝结着我们首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队在战斗中相互关心，相互支持的无产阶级深情厚谊。我们应该把大家决心落实毛主席最新指示，宣传好毛泽东思想的一片忠心，献给我们伟大领袖毛主席。
    四团宣传队的全体战士，精选了八个鲜桃，端端正正地摆在红彤彤的托盘上，并写下八个金光闪闪的大字：祝毛主席万寿无疆！
    四团同志的行动，立即得到了各团战士的赞同和支持，大家商量决定，马上送到中南海，敬献给我们伟大领袖毛主席。就在这个时候，毛主席赠送珍贵礼物的特大喜讯，从中南海飞到了清华园。清华园里沸腾了。整装待发的宣传队战士激动地说：毛主席惦记着我们，我们想着毛主席，毛主席和我们真是心连心啊！他们脸上滚动着幸福的泪花，仰望着中南海的灯光，不约而同发出了同一个声音：毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！欢呼声汇成了一股强大的声浪，响彻在首都夜空。
    夜，已经很深了。天，正下着雨。但是，同志们说：就是天下刀子也阻挡不住我们表达对毛主席的一片赤胆忠心！他们推选了二百四十名代表，冒雨把寿桃送往中南海。
    就在此时此刻，毛主席赠送珍贵礼物的特大喜讯，先从电波里传到了工厂，传到了学校，传到了首都无产阶级革命派的心坎上。
　　爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲
    伟大的领袖毛主席向首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队赠送芒果，极大地鼓舞了首都工人阶级和广大工农兵群众。他们纷纷表示决心，一定要永远跟着毛主席，永远忠于毛主席。
    晚上九点钟，毛主席把芒果送给首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队的消息，刚刚从广播喇叭传出，黄金生的心，立即飞向了毛主席。当他看到那珍贵的礼物，一股幸福的暖流涌上了心头。他激动得流下了热泪，举起双手，高呼：毛主席万万岁！
      黄金生，这个北京齿轮厂的气焊工人，站在芒果面前，不禁引起了回忆。他今年三十六岁了，正好在旧社会过了十八年，在新社会也过了十八年。他想，这两个十八年，是多么鲜明的对比啊！
    三十六年前，黄金生一出世，就落入了旧社会这个人间地狱。父亲是个躬着腰，一天累到晚，得不到几个铜板的黄包车夫。全家老小六口人，过着“苦菜充饥，豆渣当粮”的牛马生活。十二岁的黄金生，就被迫提着个破筐子到处拣破烂，饿得面黄肌瘦，皮包骨头。当他饿得难以忍受时，就去有钱人家的阴沟里掏刷锅米吃。毛主席说：“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”，在旧社会的十八年，给黄金生留下的是说不完的仇恨，他怎么能忘记呢？
    一九四九年，北京解放了，黄金生从此获得了新生。他当了工人，生活越过越好。现在，他家也是六口人，爱人是个刨工，孩子上了学。他想：这真是换了人间啊！
    黄金生，这个毛泽东思想宣传员，他在清华园里宣传毛泽东思想，风里来，雨里去，不怕苦，不怕累。经过解放前后两个十八年的对比，更加深了对毛主席的热爱。他想，只有毛主席，才是咱穷人的大救星！只有毛主席，才会和咱们心连心！我们要永远忠于毛主席，毛主席永远是我们心中的红太阳。他站在毛主席像前表示自己的决心：我们一定要在以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的号令下，和革命红卫兵小将一起，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，统一意志，统一步伐，统一行动，彻底批判反动的资产阶级的“多中心论”。誓死捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，生为毛主席的无产阶级革命路线而战斗，死为毛主席的无产阶级革命路线而献身！
      “最响亮的歌是《东方红》，最伟大的领袖是毛泽东。……”北京第二通用机械厂老工人、共产党员姚德福，听着这激动人心的歌曲，看着毛主席赠送的珍贵礼物芒果，心中冉冉升起一轮光焰无际的红太阳。红太阳啊，红太阳！是您给我们一家带来了光明，是您给我们照明了革命胜利的航程。他喜泪盈眶，思潮滚滚。
    姚德福出身在劳苦的工人家庭。他父亲自小就给资本家做工，最后却被资本家逼死，姐姐卖给了人家，妈妈长年累月给人当奶妈。他自己十三岁起，就在资本家的皮鞭下当牛做马。解放后，他当家做了主人。在文化大革命中，他和广大无产阶级革命派一起，同以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派进行了坚决斗争，捍卫了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。这次他参加了首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队。这一切，他连做梦也没想到呀！
    姚德福的心情再也不能平静了。他立即拿出笔来，准备写出自己对伟大领袖毛主席的一片忠心。但是，由于他文化水平低，写了一次又一次，总不能充分表达自己对毛主席的深情厚意。有的战友看着他写得那样费劲，说：“老姚，我帮你写吧。”他坚定地回答说：“不！我一定要用自己的笔，用自己的话，表达我无限忠于毛主席的忠心，表达落实毛主席最新指示和紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署的决心。”毛泽东思想给了他无穷的力量，他写呀写呀，一直写到深夜三点多钟，最后终于胜利了。他脸上绽开幸福的笑容，轻轻地唱起自己心爱的歌：“天大地大不如党的恩情大，爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲……。”
　　紧跟毛主席干革命
    工人阶级热爱毛泽东思想，也最热情宣传毛泽东思想。毛主席送来芒果，给首都工人阶级送来了毛泽东思想，送来了威力无穷的精神原子弹。他们更加热爱毛泽东思想，更加热情地宣传毛泽东思想。
    北京人民印刷厂毛泽东思想宣传队，要出发到清华园去了。他们要以最快的速度赶印宣传毛泽东思想的宣传品。这个消息传到制版车间，大家一致表示：“忠不忠，看行动。困难再大，也没有我们宣传毛泽东思想的劲头大。”该下班的同志也不下班，该休息的同志也不休息。大家决心在最短时间内完成任务。
    在通常情况下，他们要按照原稿照相放大，然后制版，这样需要二十四个小时才能出成品。如果把字写在硫酸纸上，然后制版，也需要十几个小时，可是，时间来不及，怎么办？
    制版工人田铁生、富宗智、段友泉等同志，遵照毛主席的教导，“人类总得不断地总结经验，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进。”他们敢想敢干，打破老框框，敢于创新。经过研究，他们采用了直接用油墨在铅皮感光膜上写字的办法。结果由制版到出成品只花了三个多小时，圆满地完成了任务。工人田铁生兴奋地说：“不容易做到的事，今天做到了。为什么？就是因为我们热爱毛泽东思想啊！”他见到了毛主席送来的礼物，决心要以更大的努力，同清华大学革命的红卫兵小将、革命的师生员工一起学习毛泽东思想，宣传毛泽东思想。
    北京标准件二厂驻清华毛泽东思想宣传队的同志们，听到毛主席赠送芒果的特大喜讯以后，个个激动得热泪盈眶，高兴得跳了起来。为了使更多的人都能共同分享这一最大幸福，他们连夜赶印这一特大喜讯的传单。工人们激动地说：“这不是普通的芒果，而是雨露，是阳光。我们一定要把这一消息传达到广大工农兵群众的心坎里。”全班十个人，以无限忠于毛主席的红心，投入了这一战斗。
    到了深夜一点多钟，他们把一千多份传单印好了。这时，班长向大家提出：“我们要走一路，红一线；住一地，红一片。走到哪里，把喜讯传到哪里，把毛泽东思想宣传到哪里。”为了把这一喜讯尽快地送到广大革命群众的心中，他们冒着大雨，连夜走出清华园。他们不怕困难，不怕疲劳，哪里有人群就向哪里走，哪里有灯光就往哪里奔。他们把这一喜讯送到了工厂、机关、学校、医院，送到了清洁工人、牛奶工人、三轮车工人的手中。
    经过三个多小时步行，他们来到了自己的工厂，把特大喜讯送到了每一个人的心坎里。他们用这样的诗句来表达自己的心意：“颗颗芒果恩情深，毛主席和我们心连心。特大喜讯处处传，紧跟毛主席干革命！”
　　代代忠于毛主席
    为了让子孙万代永远记住毛主席的最大关怀，扎下毛泽东思想的深根，广大革命群众想方设法把毛主席亲手赠送的珍贵礼品芒果保存下来。请看，这是一个多么动人的情景啊！
    八月五日深夜十一点以后，北京人民印刷厂的庆祝大会刚刚开过。这时，大家议论道：“我们要把毛主席的珍贵礼物传下去，要让子子孙孙永远忠于毛主席，一定要把它保藏好。”
    这时，医务所的二十多个同志都不约而同地给革委会出谋献策。他们说，要使芒果长期保存下来，就要找到一种长期保存植物标本的药水才行。
    怎么办呢？有人提出：北京农业展览馆可能会有这种药水。广播员铁兵听说那里有，心里乐得开了花。她连跳带跑赶到司机宿舍。司机同志刚刚开车回来，准备睡觉。但是，他听说要完成这件重要任务，就连忙起来，冒着大雨，开车直奔农业展览馆。到了那里，叫开了门，才知道没有这种药水。
    这时已是凌晨三点多钟了，天还下着大雨，挺凉的。同大家一起去的司药李淑英，身上穿着短袖衫，她小心地把装着芒果的瓶子抱在怀里。铁兵问她：“冷不冷？”她笑笑说：“抱着毛主席的礼物，一点不冷。”
    大家又商量一番，决定到自然博物馆去。因为那里经常保存植物标本，可能有办法。车子开到那里，天已快亮了。他们敲门进去，听说有这种药水，个个高兴得蹦起来。
    长期保存芒果的问题解决了，木工们连饭也不吃，赶制了一个高大的玻璃盒，把芒果放在里面。工人们说：“保存芒果，是件大事。我们一定要把它保存好，让毛主席的无产阶级革命路线永远刻在心上。”
    再来看看巨山农场的贫下中农吧！他们决心要把芒果移植到北方来。
    巨山农场迎接芒果的大会结束了，果树队的刘淑华同志和全体贫下中农一样，站在会场上久久不愿离开。她深情地走向放置芒果的地方，她又低头闻一闻那散发着幽香的芒果；抬头凝视着毛主席的画像，脸上泛起幸福的红润。她象发现什么新问题似的，转过身，飞步跑回宿舍，翻箱倒柜，终于找出了她要找的那本书。她找到了有关叙述芒果的章节，小声地念了起来。她沉浸在幸福的美好的愿望中。
    刘淑华想的什么呢？原来她下决心要试验把芒果移植到巨山农场来。她说：“我是管果树的。今天毛主席把外国朋友送给他老人家的芒果转送给我们贫下中农，这是毛主席他老人家对我们的最大关怀，最大鼓舞，最大鞭策啊！我要在巨山农场用自己的双手培植起芒果来，好让广大贫下中农看到芒果，就想到我们敬爱的毛主席，让毛主席的芒果千秋万代永远长在我们巨山农场贫下中农的心田里。”刘淑华这个倡议，得到广大贫下中农的坚决支持。她有信心搞好这个试验。
    清华大学革命的红卫兵小将和革命的师生员工，也纷纷表示，要向工人农民学习，象他们一样在头脑中扎下毛泽东思想的根子。
    伟大的领袖毛主席，我们心中最红最红的红太阳！我们看到了芒果，就想到了您的嘱咐、叮咛和希望！我们决心紧跟您的伟大战略部署，全面落实您的最新指示，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
