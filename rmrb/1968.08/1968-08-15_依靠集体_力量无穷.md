Our Gouwang Brigade, originally the most remote and impoverished brigade in Qiliying People's Commune, had relied on state relief grain for many years. The immense power of the people's commune's "big and public" principles transformed us from poverty to prosperity. In 1965, when we first delivered surplus grain to the state, the poor and lower-middle peasants of our brigade joyfully shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!"

On August 6th of this year, it was the tenth anniversary of the great leader Chairman Mao's inspection of Qiliying People's Commune. Reflecting on the past ten years of following Chairman Mao's path of people's commune, and looking at the happy life before us, the poor and lower-middle peasants are all very moved. This is the happy path led by Chairman Mao. No matter the storms or waves, we will follow it with one heart. The Chinese Khrushchev tries every means to sabotage the people's commune, but the poor and lower-middle peasants of Gouwang Brigade will never agree!

In the early days of the commune, our brigade had thin land, low yields, few livestock, and not a single piece of advanced production equipment. We were truly "poor and blank." The commune helped us in many ways to stand up and make a revolution with our brigade of about 170 households and over 800 people. Chairman Mao said, "When poor, think of change, to do, to make a revolution." We followed Chairman Mao's teachings.

Our brigade is an old disaster-stricken area with a poor foundation and difficult living conditions. Under the battle cry of "preferring hard work to hardship, fighting for three years to change the face," the poor and lower-middle peasants of Gouwang Brigade were spirited, full of vigor, and full of enthusiasm. We launched a battle to demand grain and cotton from the land. To turn the 200 mu of wasteland in the western part of the village into fertile fields, we braved the wind and snow, fought through the harsh winter, broke the frozen soil, and dug out 300,000 catties of grass roots with spades and shovels. Then we reclaimed over 100 mu of saline-alkali wasteland. We organized vehicles, shouldered loads, and carried out pit digging, soil replacement, and planting. At the same time, we deep plowed and leveled over 500 mu of cotton fields. Three years passed, the wasteland was reclaimed, the saline-alkali land was improved, the land was leveled, and production developed.

Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the grain and cotton yields of our Gouwang Brigade have increased year by year. Last year, agricultural production achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. The grain-deficient brigade became a surplus grain brigade, no longer needing state supplies, and even sold a large amount of grain and cotton to the state. Our brigade also set up small factories for cotton ginning, cotton spinning, oil pressing, rice milling, and flour grinding, as well as a forest farm. We developed large livestock, added advanced production tools, and had large mules, horses, and cars and carts that we never had before. The living conditions of the commune members have greatly improved, and poor Gouwang has become rich Gouwang. The poor and lower-middle peasants say, "This is given to us by Chairman Mao, this is given to us by the people's commune."

　　依靠集体　力量无穷
    我们沟王大队，原来是七里营人民公社最边远最穷困的一个大队。多少年来，都靠吃国家的救济粮。人民公社“一大二公”的无比威力，使我们由穷变富，一九六五年我们第一次向国家交售余粮时，我们大队的贫下中农都高兴地高呼：毛主席万岁！
    今年八月六日，是伟大领袖毛主席视察七里营人民公社十周年。回顾十年来我们紧跟毛主席走人民公社化的道路，看看眼前的幸福生活，贫下中农个个都很激动。这是毛主席领导我们走的幸福道，不管风里浪里，我们一个心眼走到底。中国赫鲁晓夫千方百计要搞垮人民公社，我们沟王大队的贫下中农一万个不答应！
    公社化初期，我们大队土地薄、产量低、牲畜少，先进的生产工具没有一件，真算是“一穷二白”。公社从多方面帮助我们这个一百七十来户八百多口人的穷队站起来闹革命。毛主席说：“穷则思变，要干，要革命。”我们就是遵照毛主席的教导去办的。
    我们这个队是老灾区，底子差，生活困难。在“宁愿苦战，不愿苦熬，奋战三年，改变面貌”的战斗口号鼓舞下，我们沟王大队的贫下中农，精神振奋，意气风发，干劲冲天，展开了向土地要粮要棉的战斗。为了把村西多年的二百亩“茅草荒”变成良田，我们冒风雪，战严冬，破冻土，一锄一锄，一锨一锨，刨出了三十万斤草根。接着又改造了一百多亩盐碱荒。我们组织大小车辆，肩挑人抬，进行挖坑换土点种，同时又对五六百亩棉田进行了深翻，平整。三年过去了，茅草荒消灭了，盐碱地改造了，土地平整了，生产发展了。
    在毛泽东思想的统帅下，我们沟王大队的粮棉产量逐年提高。去年农业生产获得了空前未有的大丰收，缺粮队变成了余粮队，不要国家供应，还卖给国家大批粮棉。我们大队还办了轧花、弹花、榨油、碾米、磨面等小型工厂和林场，发展了大家畜，添置了先进的生产工具，有了大骡、大马和过去没有的汽车、马车。社员生活大改善，穷沟王变成了富沟王。贫下中农说：“这是毛主席给我们的，是人民公社化给我们的。”
