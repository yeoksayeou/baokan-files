The red hearts of coastal defense soldiers forever face the red sun
Fujian Frontline, a regiment commander and a second-level combat hero from East China, Lü Xiangsheng

On August 11th, the great teacher of the world's revolutionary people, our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin received us. Our hearts surged with emotion and tears of joy flowed. A thousand words and ten thousand thoughts welled up in our hearts. We joyously shouted and sang, time and again bursting from our hearts with the strongest voice of the times: Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live!

Most beloved great leader Chairman Mao! In the great situation where the entire nation's military and people are seizing a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, you personally received us, adding to our great strength to complete the glorious task of "three supports, two military actions," and giving us a powerful impetus to seize a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is your greatest concern, greatest encouragement, and greatest whip for us coastal defense soldiers!

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! We, the soldiers who are forever loyal to you and guard the coasts of the East China Sea, sing "The East is Red" every day as the red sun rises in the east, and every night we gaze at the North Star, loving and missing you dearly. Guarding the coastal front is like guarding Tiananmen Square, like guarding by your side. Although Fujian Frontline and Beijing are separated by countless mountains and rivers, the red hearts of coastal defense soldiers are forever closely connected with you. We sincerely wish you eternal life! Eternal life!

"The vast ocean relies on the helmsman, revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." Beloved Chairman Mao! We will forever take Vice Chairman Lin as our shining example, study and apply your brilliant thoughts, forever be loyal to your brilliant thoughts, forever be loyal to your proletarian revolutionary line, read your books for a lifetime, listen to your words, and act according to your instructions, becoming your good soldiers.

We pledge to you: We will resolutely implement your brilliant thoughts on political construction of the military, follow your great strategic deployment without deviating a step. To defend your proletarian revolutionary line, we dare to climb mountains of knives and leap into seas of fire. The sea may dry up, and the stones may crumble, but our loyalty to you will never change. We will definitely use your brilliant "Three Constantly Read Articles" as sharp weapons to reform our thoughts, study them every day, use them every day, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois "self," and firmly establish the proletarian "public," forever preserving our revolutionary youth and aspiring to be proletarian soldiers who continue and thoroughly carry out the revolution under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! We firmly remember your teaching to "never forget class struggle," always arming our minds with your brilliant thoughts, constantly analyzing the new situation, new characteristics, and new trends of class struggle. Currently, in the great situation of seizing a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a handful of desperate class enemies are using the reactionary bourgeois "multi-center theory" to sow discord, spread rumors, and create trouble, attempting to disrupt Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and hinder the implementation of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We must fiercely criticize and thoroughly criticize them.

Great leader Chairman Mao is the reddest red sun in the hearts of revolutionary people. The proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin is the sole leadership center for the entire Party, the entire military, the entire nation, and all revolutionary masses. With this leadership center, the revolution advances and achieves victory! We must closely unite around this leadership center, resolutely defend this leadership center, and if anyone dares to attempt to shake and destroy this leadership center, we will resolutely fight them!

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! In the great march to seize a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we will definitely remember your teaching to "pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining strength, do not seek fame like Emperor Xiang Yu." We will launch a fierce attack on China's Khrushchev and his agents in Fujian, thoroughly criticizing them politically, ideologically, and theoretically. Under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters led by you, we will resolutely carry out and thoroughly implement every new instruction from you, determined to take actual actions to welcome the birth of the Fujian Provincial Revolutionary Committee and achieve new victories in the struggle to seize a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

　　海防战士的红心永向红太阳
　　福建前线某部团长、华东二级战斗英雄　吕祥胜
    八月十一日，全世界革命人民的伟大导师，我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席接见了我们。心潮澎湃喜泪流，千言万语涌心头。我们纵情欢呼，放声歌唱，一次又一次地从心里迸发出时代的最强音，毛主席万岁！万万岁！
    最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席啊！在全国亿万军民夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的大好形势下，您老人家亲自接见我们，给我们增添了胜利完成“三支”、“两军”光荣任务的巨大力量，给了我们夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的强大动力。这是您老人家对我们海防战士的最大关怀，最大鼓舞，最大鞭策！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！我们守卫在东海之滨的永远忠于您的战士，天天迎着东方升起的红太阳，纵情歌唱《东方红》，夜夜仰望着北斗星，无限热爱、无限想念您老人家。我们守卫在海防前哨，就象守卫在天安门前，守卫在您老人家身旁一样。福建前线和北京，虽隔千山万水，但海防战士的红心永远和您老人家紧紧相连。我们最衷心祝愿您老人家万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
      “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”敬爱的毛主席啊！我们要永远以林副主席为光辉榜样，活学活用您的光辉思想，永远忠于您的光辉思想，永远忠于您的无产阶级革命路线，一辈子读您的书，听您的话，照您的指示办事，做您的好战士。

    毛主席啊，毛主席！我们牢记您“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，时刻用您的光辉思想武装自己的头脑，不断分析阶级斗争的新形势、新特点、新动向。当前，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的一片大好形势下，一小撮穷途末路的阶级敌人，利用反动的资产阶级的“多中心论”，挑拨离间、造谣生事，妄图干扰毛主席的伟大战略部署，妨碍毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的贯彻执行，我们必须狠狠批判，彻底批判。
    伟大领袖毛主席是我们革命人民心中最红最红的红太阳。以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部是全党、全军、全国和广大革命群众唯一的领导中心。有了这个领导中心，革命就前进，就胜利！我们就是要紧紧团结在这个领导中心周围，坚决保卫这个领导中心，谁要是妄图来动摇和破坏这个领导中心，我们就坚决和他拚！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大进军中，我们一定牢记您的“宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王”的教导，对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在福建的代理人发起猛烈进攻，从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底把他们批深批透，批倒批臭。在以您为首的无产阶级司令部的领导下，我们对您的每一个最新指示，都坚决照办，彻底执行，决心以实际行动迎接福建省革命委员会的诞生，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利的斗争中立新功！
