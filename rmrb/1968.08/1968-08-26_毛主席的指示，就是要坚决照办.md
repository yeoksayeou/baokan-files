Chairman Mao's instructions must be carried out resolutely. This is what the Zhenshun Brigade of Cuicun People's Commune firmly believes.

The mad counterrevolutionary, Chinese Khrushchev, fiercely opposes the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, sabotages the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and recklessly claims that "'At any time, on any issue, we must seriously study the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao...' These words are not entirely correct." This is extremely reactionary!

Chairman Mao is the great savior of the poor and lower-middle peasants. Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeline of the poor and lower-middle peasants. Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is the guiding light for the poor and lower-middle peasants. We, the poor and lower-middle peasants, must, at any time and on any issue, seriously study, deeply understand, and resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's instructions, word for word!

This year, during the busy summer agricultural season, with the help of the PLA comrades, we insisted on studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, taking the path of emphasizing proletarian politics, using revolution to promote production, and carrying out thorough and widespread revolutionary criticism. The summer agricultural work was carried out with great enthusiasm.

When we started harvesting the wheat early in the morning, we studied Chairman Mao's teaching that "The arduous task is like a burden placed before us, let's see if we dare to shoulder it," which inspired everyone's enthusiasm for harvesting the wheat. When discussing the work points for harvesting wheat, we studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "serving the people" and that politics is the commander, the soul. We criticized Chinese Khrushchev's fallacies of "material incentives" and "work points in command," establishing the idea of "farming for the revolution, not for work points." Everyone's heart was set on socialism, and all efforts were directed towards collective production. When it was too dry to plant corn, we studied Chairman Mao's teaching that "This army has an indomitable spirit, it will overwhelm all enemies and will never be subdued by enemies," mobilizing the masses to carry water and sow seeds. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants said: "No matter how busy the work is, no matter how many things there are, we insist on reading Chairman Mao's books every day. Our minds are clear, our spirits are high, our enthusiasm for work is greater, and our determination to take the socialist road is stronger." This year's summer agricultural battle was completed ten days earlier than previous years, fighting for nine days to carry water and rush-plant 800 mu of corn, overcoming a severe drought that had not been seen in seventy years.

Is it "politics takes a back seat during the busy season" or "politics leads during the busy season"? This is a major issue of whether to take the capitalist road or the socialist road. Leading with politics can ensure the socialist direction and drive production with revolution. If politics takes a back seat, it will inevitably lead to the revisionist path. Chinese Khrushchev attempts to sabotage our study and application of Chairman Mao's works and opposes emphasizing proletarian politics. We will not be deceived. The poor and lower-middle peasants say: "Emphasizing politics is truly good, Mao Zedong Thought guides us every day. During the busy season, we do not forget the fundamentals, and we will definitely take the socialist road. We carry out class struggle every day and sweep away selfish and impure thoughts every day. We strive hard to achieve a bumper harvest, and the iron fortress will never fall!"

    毛主席的指示，就是要坚决照办
    崔村公社真顺大队
    中国赫鲁晓夫疯狂反对战无不胜的毛泽东思想，破坏活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，胡说什么“‘在任何时候，任何问题上，我们都必须认真学习党中央、毛主席的指示……’这些话，不完全正确”，真是反动极了！
    毛主席是我们贫下中农的大救星，毛泽东思想是我们贫下中农的命根子，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线是我们贫下中农的指路明灯。我们贫下中农就是要在任何时候、任何问题上，对毛主席的指示认真学习，深刻领会，坚决照办，句句照办！
    今年“三夏”大忙季节，在解放军同志帮助下，我们坚持活学活用毛泽东思想，走“农闲多学，农忙狠学，大忙大学”的突出无产阶级政治的道路，以革命带动生产，革命大批判搞得深入广泛，“三夏”生产搞得热火朝天。
    起早拔麦子，我们学习毛主席关于“艰苦的工作就象担子，摆在我们的面前，看我们敢不敢承担”的教导，激发大家拔麦子的劳动热情。讨论拔麦子的工分时，我们学习毛主席“为人民服务”和政治是统帅，是灵魂的教导，批判中国赫鲁晓夫“物质刺激”、“工分挂帅”的谬论，树立“为革命种田，不是为工分”的思想，大家一个心眼往社会主义上想，一个劲往集体生产上使。天旱种不下玉米，我们学习毛主席“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服”的教导，发动群众，挑水播种。广大贫下中农说：“活儿再忙，事儿再多，每天坚持读毛主席的书，俺们心明眼又亮，越学干劲儿越足，走社会主义道路的决心越大。”今年“三夏”战斗，比往年提早十天完成了收麦打麦任务，奋战九天，挑水抢种完八百亩玉米，战胜了七十年来少有的干旱。
      “农忙政治靠边”，还是“农忙政治领先”？这是走资本主义道路，还是走社会主义道路的大问题。政治挂帅，就能坚持社会主义方向，以革命推动生产。政治靠边，就必然走上修正主义邪路。中国赫鲁晓夫妄想破坏我们活学活用毛主席著作，反对突出无产阶级政治，我们决不上当。贫下中农说：“突出政治真正好，毛泽东思想天天照。农忙不忘抓根本，社会主义走定了。阶级斗争天天搞，私心杂念天天扫。艰苦奋战夺丰收，铁打江山永不倒！”
