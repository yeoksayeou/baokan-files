The Brazilian Communist Party's organ, "Worker's Class Newspaper," recently published an article stating that Chairman Mao's statement supporting the struggle of American Blacks against violence "illuminates the path of national and social liberation for the peoples of all countries."

The article states, "Chairman Mao's statement has special significance for all revolutionary people. The Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China strongly calls on the workers, peasants, and intellectuals of the entire world to support the great movement of the oppressed Black masses in America, and at the same time, using the viewpoint of Marxism-Leninism, analyzes the true content of this movement, emphasizing the development of the world revolution. Mao Zedong, as the true leader of the peoples of all countries, has issued this call."

The article discusses Chairman Mao's viewpoint on the fundamental contradiction between the broad Black masses in America and the American ruling class, stating, "Chairman Mao convincingly points out that the conflicts currently taking place in America are essentially social issues. Blacks in America are the laborers most oppressed and exploited by the American monopolist bourgeoisie. Only by overthrowing the imperialist rulers can they be liberated from racial oppression. This means that American Blacks can only achieve complete victory by uniting with white laborers in the struggle against their common enemy, the American big capitalists."

The article continues, "Mao Zedong, with the keen insight of a seasoned Marxist-Leninist, points out that the world revolution has entered a new era. This is a valuable judgment that reflects reality. The peoples of all countries are rising up against America, and especially in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the national liberation movements have reached a new level through armed struggle. American imperialism is not only being countered in the vast regions of the colonies and dependent countries, but is also being struck in the developed capitalist countries. Therefore, Chairman Mao's wise directive that the peoples of all countries should launch a sustained and fierce offensive against American imperialism is very timely. No matter how cruel and arduous the struggle, the days of American imperialism are numbered. It cannot escape its ultimate downfall."

The article concludes, "The lofty ideas contained in Mao Zedong's statement greatly help Brazilian revolutionaries to deeply understand the current situation and more firmly struggle against American plunderers and military dictators. It illuminates the path of national and social liberation for the peoples of all countries."

    巴西共产党机关报热情赞扬毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明
    毛主席声明照耀着世界人民解放的道路
    只有打倒美帝国主义，美国黑人才能从种族压迫下解放出来
    新华社十七日讯　巴西共产党机关报《工人阶级报》最近发表文章指出，毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明，“照耀着世界各国人民的民族和社会解放的道路”。
    文章说，毛主席的声明“对所有的革命人民有着特殊的意义。中国共产党中央委员会主席强烈呼吁全世界的工人、农民和知识分子支持美国受压迫的黑人群众的伟大运动，同时用马克思列宁主义观点分析了这一运动的真正内容，强调了世界革命的发展。毛泽东作为各国人民的真正领袖发出了呼吁。”
    文章谈到毛主席关于美国广大黑人同美国统治集团之间的矛盾是阶级矛盾的观点时指出，毛主席“令人信服地指出了当前在美国发生的冲突实质上是一个社会问题。黑人在美国是最受美国垄断资产阶级压迫和剥削的劳动者。只有打倒当权的帝国主义分子，他们才能从种族压迫下解放出来。这意味着美国黑人只有在反对共同敌人美国大资本家的斗争中同白人劳动者联合起来，才能取得彻底的胜利。”
    文章接着说：“毛泽东以他的久经考验的马克思列宁主义者的敏锐眼光指出，世界革命进入了一个新时代。这是一个反映现实的宝贵的论断。各国人民都起来反对美国，特别是亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族解放运动通过武装斗争达到了新的水平。美帝国主义不仅在殖民地和附属国世界的广大地区遭到反击，而且在发达的资本主义国家也遭到了打击。”“因此，毛主席关于各国人民应该向美帝国主义发动持久的猛烈的进攻的英明指示，是十分适时的。不管斗争怎样残酷怎样艰巨，美帝国主义的日子不长了。它逃脱不了最后的垮台。”
    文章最后说：“毛泽东的声明中包含的崇高思想，对巴西革命者深刻地理解当前形势、更加坚定地同美国掠夺者和军事独裁进行斗争，有极大的帮助。它照耀着世界各国人民的民族和社会解放的道路。”
