	The wave of black people's anti-violence struggles in the United States has not yet subsided, and another wave has risen. In recent days, in Miami, Florida, Harvey Town in the suburbs of Chicago, Jackson City in Michigan, and Los Angeles, California, black people's anti-violence struggles have erupted one after another.

	On the afternoon of the 7th, a group of black youth in Miami held a meeting in a building to discuss various issues related to black people. A reactionary police squad, upon hearing the news, rushed to the scene and surrounded the building, provoking trouble. The black youth were very indignant at the police's provocation. They rushed out of the meeting venue and onto the streets, using bottles, stones, and other objects to engage in fierce struggles with the reactionary police. The enraged black youth also set fire to cars belonging to white racists and smashed the display windows of white exploiters' shops. The reactionary authorities dispatched 200 fully equipped police officers with guns, ammunition, and bulletproof vests to suppress the demonstrations, indiscriminately firing tear gas at the black demonstrators. The governor of Florida also ordered 500 members of the "National Guard" to be on alert.

	However, the black masses continued their struggle. Until late at night, police cars and cars belonging to white racists still could not pass through the black residential areas.

	In Harvey Town, a suburb south of Chicago, a large group of black youth, in protest of the reactionary authorities' protection of the police who brutally shot a 15-year-old black boy, held a demonstration on the 6th and threw bricks, stones, and glass bottles at the police. The demonstrating black youth also engaged in fierce gun battles with the police, injuring seven police officers. The reactionary authorities exclaimed that the situation was "extremely serious."

	In addition, on the 5th, in Jackson City, Michigan, and from the 4th to the 6th in Los Angeles, California, black people also engaged in armed anti-violence struggles.

　　美国各地相继爆发黑人抗暴斗争
    迈阿密黑人愤怒上街烧毁种族主义者汽车，同警察英勇搏斗
　　芝加哥黑人同警察枪战，打伤七名警察反动当局惊呼局势“非常严重”
    新华社八日讯  华盛顿消息：美国黑人抗暴斗争的浪潮一波未平，一波又起。连日来，在弗罗里达州的迈阿密、芝加哥郊区的哈维镇、密执安州的杰克逊城和加利福尼亚州的洛杉矶等地，又相继爆发了黑人抗暴斗争。
    七日下午，迈阿密市一批黑人青年在一所建筑物里举行集会，讨论有关黑人的各种问题。一队反动警察闻讯赶来，包围了这座建筑物，进行无理挑衅。黑人青年对警察的挑衅十分愤慨，他们涌出会场，走上街头，用瓶子、石块等同反动警察进行激烈的搏斗。愤怒的黑人青年还放火烧白人种族主义者的汽车，捣毁白人剥削者商店的橱窗。反动当局派遣了两百名配有枪支、弹药、防弹衣等全副装备的警察前往镇压，向示威黑人滥放催泪瓦斯。弗罗里达州长还命令五百名“国民警卫队”处于警戒状态。
    但是，黑人群众仍然坚持斗争。直到夜晚，警车和白人种族主义者的汽车还无法通过黑人居住区。
    在芝加哥南部郊区的哈维镇，一大批黑人青年为了抗议反动当局包庇野蛮枪杀一个十五岁的黑人少年的警察，六日举行示威，并向警察扔砖头、石块、玻璃瓶。示威的黑人青年还同警察展开了激烈的枪战，打伤七名警察。反动当局惊呼局势“非常严重”。
    此外，五日在密执安州的杰克逊城，四日至六日在加利福尼亚州的洛杉矶市，也相继发生了黑人的武力抗暴斗争。
