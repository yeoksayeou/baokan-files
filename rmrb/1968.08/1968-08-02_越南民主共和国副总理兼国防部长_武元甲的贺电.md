The telegram said: Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by the respected Chairman Mao, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has gone through a very glorious course of building and fighting, achieving unprecedented brilliant victories, and making a decisive contribution to the great success of the Chinese revolution. The Chinese People's Liberation Army, armed with Mao Zedong Thought and possessing excellent qualities and traditions, has demonstrated extremely rapid progress in science and technology through the successful tests of atomic and hydrogen bombs. The Vietnamese People's Armed Forces are very pleased and delighted with the brilliant achievements of the brotherly Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army, and regard these victories as their own.

Recently, the congratulatory telegram from the Ministry of National Defense of the People's Republic of China on the downing of 3,000 U.S. imperialist aircraft by our military and people is a great encouragement to us. The Vietnamese people and the People's Armed Forces express their deep gratitude for this invaluable support, encouragement, and assistance.

The telegram said: On this glorious occasion, all officers and soldiers of the Vietnamese People's Army sincerely wish the brotherly Chinese People's Liberation Army greater victories in defending the cause of socialist construction, consolidating national defense, and being ready at all times to foil all plots and actions of U.S. imperialist aggression.

Long live the everlasting fraternal unity between the peoples and armed forces of Vietnam and China.
