At the Beijing Knitting Factory, drums thundered, firecrackers exploded, and everyone's hearts were filled with joy. Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! The revolutionary workers, who are infinitely loyal to you, once again immersed themselves in the fervent atmosphere of celebrating your latest directive.

Chairman Mao's latest directive calls on revolutionary workers to engage in intense struggle. As soon as Central People's Radio broadcasted Chairman Mao's latest directive, the workers at the Beijing Knitting Factory promptly recorded it, printed over four thousand copies, and distributed them everywhere. Under the leadership of the revolutionary committee, they held meetings and study sessions throughout the night, forming propaganda teams that went to the streets, into residential areas, and to schools.

	Driver and veteran worker Yu Zhaoxiang was originally on the night shift, but upon hearing about Chairman Mao's latest directive, he rushed to the factory. He knew: a truck driver has the responsibility to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. Upon arriving at the factory, when everyone was ready to set out for propaganda, he immediately volunteered to drive. Everyone said, "You are sick, go rest!" He replied, "Propagating Mao Zedong Thought is everyone's responsibility!" Saying this, he jumped into the car and drove everyone to the streets.

	Zhang Meimei, a worker who suffered greatly in the old society, was even more excited upon hearing Chairman Mao's latest directive. She started working for the capitalists at the age of seven and was often beaten and scolded. She had no summer clothes, no winter clothes, ate leftovers, and slept on the floor, struggling on the brink of death every day. Zhang Meimei angrily said, "The children of landlords and capitalists went to school at a young age, but I was forced to leave home at a young age and lived a life worse than cattle and horses. Poor children, not only could they not enter the school gate, but they couldn't even stand by the gate!" Thinking of her childhood, Zhang Meimei hated the old society and Chinese Khrushchev even more, and she loved the new society, Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line even more. She poured this love into her work and into implementing Chairman Mao's directives.

	She truly did whatever Chairman Mao said. Once, the organization wanted to transfer her to work in the nursery, and she went without a second thought. Someone said, "The work in the nursery is too difficult; you'll quit after three months!" But she followed Chairman Mao's teaching, "The more difficult the place, the more we must go," and has been working there ever since. Today, seeing that Chairman Mao's latest directive praises the working class so highly and places the working class in such an important position, she felt especially happy but also felt a great responsibility. She said, "Chairman Mao supports us, the working class, so much, asking us to lead everything. The responsibility is great; we must work hard, otherwise how can we repay our great leader Chairman Mao!" Not only did she actively propagate and implement Mao Zedong Thought, but she also led the sisters in the nursery to join this work. This time, upon hearing Chairman Mao's latest directive, they immediately organized themselves to write slogans, copy quotations, and write resolutions, then pasted them everywhere, working through the night, and no one felt tired.

    咱们工人阶级就是要领导一切
    在北京针织总厂，战鼓震天，鞭炮齐鸣，人人心花怒放。毛主席啊，毛主席！无限忠于您的革命工人再一次沉浸在欢呼您的最新指示发表的热烈气氛中。
    毛主席的最新指示，召唤着革命工人投入紧张的战斗。中央人民广播电台刚刚广播完毛主席的最新指示，北京针织总厂的工人就及时把它记录下来，印了四千多份，四方散发。他们在革委会的领导之下，连夜开会座谈、学习，并组成一支支宣传队伍，走上街头，走进家属区，走向学校……。
    司机、老工人于朝祥本来上夜班，但他听说有毛主席最新指示，就赶紧往厂里跑。因为他知道：一个汽车司机，有责任宣传好毛泽东思想。到了工厂，大伙要出发宣传，他立刻要求开车。大伙说：“你身体有病，好好休息吧！”他说：“宣传毛泽东思想人人有责！”说着，他就跳上车去，把大伙送上街头。
    张美娣，这个在旧社会饱尝辛酸的女工，听到毛主席的最新指示，更是十分兴奋。她七岁就给资本家做工，经常挨打受骂。夏无单，冬无棉，吃剩饭，睡地板，天天在死亡线上挣扎。张美娣愤怒地说：“地主、资本家的子女很小就上学，我却从小被迫离开了家，过着牛马般的生活。穷人的孩子呀，不用说进校门，就连在门口站一站也不能呀！”想起了自己的童年，张美娣无比痛恨旧社会，痛恨中国赫鲁晓夫，无限热爱新社会，无限热爱毛主席，热爱毛泽东思想，热爱毛主席的革命路线。她把这种爱倾注在自己的工作上，倾注在落实毛主席的指示上。
    她真正做到了毛主席说啥就干啥。有一次，组织上要调她到托儿所工作，她二话没说就去了。有人说：“托儿所的工作太困难了，你进去三个月就会干不下去！”但是她遵照毛主席“越是困难的地方越是要去”的教导，一直工作到现在。今天，她看到毛主席的最新指示对工人阶级评价得这么高，把工人阶级摆在这么重要的地位，感到格外高兴，但也觉得责任非常重大。她说：“毛主席他老人家这么支持咱们工人阶级，要咱们工人阶级领导一切，责任重大，咱们得好好干，不然怎能对得起伟大领袖毛主席啊！”她不但自己积极宣传执行毛泽东思想，而且带领托儿所的姐妹也投身这项工作。这次听到毛主席的最新指示，她们立即自觉组织起来写标语，抄语录，写决心书，然后到处张贴，忙个通宵，谁也不感到疲劳。
