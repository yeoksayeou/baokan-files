"The Theory of Multiple Centers" is a Poisoned Arrow that Sabotages the Unity of the Revolutionary Forces

Comrade Lin Biao, Vice Chairman, said: "Mao Zedong Thought is the beacon of humanity, the sharpest weapon of world revolution, and the universally applicable truth. In our attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought, class distinctions are clearly reflected. Different classes, based on their own class interests, will inevitably adopt different attitudes towards Mao Zedong Thought. If you are a revolutionary warrior of the proletariat, you will regard Mao Zedong Thought as the direction of progress, the weapon of struggle, the source of strength, and the key to victory. You will study Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions earnestly and carry them out resolutely; you will carry out the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters resolutely and thoroughly, implementing what you understand and even what you temporarily do not understand, deepening your understanding in the process of implementation. This is the need of the proletarian interest, the requirement of the development of the revolutionary cause, and a Marxist-Leninist attitude. On the contrary, if you are a bourgeois egoist, you will inevitably adopt a pragmatic and compromising attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought, paying lip service while acting against it, using it for your own purposes, being two-faced, and playing tricks. This is precisely what the bourgeoisie needs. Obviously, whether to learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought or not is a concentrated expression of different class standpoints and a specific reflection of different worldviews. The reactionary nature of the 'Theory of Multiple Centers, which is essentially No Center' lies in the fact that it opposes Mao Zedong Thought with the evil attitude of the bourgeoisie. Those who hold this reactionary fallacy are ideologically individualistic, organizationally splitist, and politically anarchistic, ultimately aiming to exclude, interfere with, and sabotage the unity of the revolutionary forces based on Mao Zedong Thought, hindering proletarian revolutionaries from using Mao Zedong Thought to unify their understanding, steps, and actions. They shout revolutionary slogans but actually fight for personal and small-group interests. They study Mao Zedong Thought only to decorate their appearance, with no intention of putting it into practice. In short, they disguise themselves politically, change their appearance, take up revolutionary slogans, and distort them, aiming to disrupt the revolutionary ranks, confuse public opinion, and create social sentiment to oppose the proletarian headquarters led by Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Lin Biao, the sole leadership center. Therefore, at this critical juncture when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is on the verge of achieving overall victory, whether to study and apply Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions and the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters seriously and thoroughly is not just a matter of academic style, but a question of whether one truly supports or merely pays lip service to the great leader Comrade Mao Zedong and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought; whether one is a true revolutionary, a pseudo-revolutionary, or a counter-revolutionary; and on which side one stands in the great struggle between the two classes and the two lines.

The history of our Party's decades of struggle tells us that whenever the revolution achieves victory after victory, the dying and desperate class enemies always seek opportunities to sabotage and make a last stand. The current 'Theory of Multiple Centers, which is essentially No Center' is a poisoned arrow that sabotages the unity of the revolutionary forces. This arrow is highly toxic, corrupting people's souls, making them numb all over, and swelling their heads. Those who are poisoned by it, if not detoxified in time, will inevitably deviate from the revolutionary track of Mao Zedong Thought and conspire with the class enemies. Such people should wake up immediately; otherwise, if they continue down this reactionary path, they will fall into the bourgeois quagmire and be spit upon by the revolutionary people.

Comrade Lin Biao teaches us:

"In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the supreme commander is our Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao is the commander-in-chief. Under the great commander-in-chief's command, we should listen well to our commander-in-chief Chairman Mao. The Cultural Revolution will definitely develop smoothly and achieve great victory!"

We revolutionary warriors are infinitely loyal to the great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao and have infinite faith in the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. We study and apply Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions every day, applying what we learn bit by bit, without distortion or ambiguity. Wherever Chairman Mao points, we rush towards it, forever united around the proletarian headquarters, united on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, and strive to achieve overall victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    “多中心论”是破坏革命队伍团结的毒箭
    南海舰队　杨枫　红士
    林副主席说：“毛泽东思想是人类的灯塔，是世界革命的最锐利的武器，是放之四海而皆准的普遍真理。”在对待毛泽东思想的态度上，反映了鲜明的阶级性。不同的阶级从其本阶级的利益出发，对毛泽东思想必然采取不同的态度。你是无产阶级革命战士，你就把毛泽东思想看成前进的方向，战斗的武器，力量的源泉，制胜的法宝；对毛主席的指示就认真学习、坚决照办；对无产阶级司令部的战斗号令就坚决贯彻，彻底落实，理解的坚决执行，暂时不理解的也坚决执行，在执行过程中去加深理解。这是无产阶级利益的需要，是革命事业发展的要求，也是一种马克思列宁主义的态度。相反，你是资产阶级利己主义者，对毛泽东思想就必然采取实用主义、折衷主义的态度，阳奉阴违，口是心非，为我所用，言行不一，两面三刀。这正是资产阶级所需要的。很显然，对待毛泽东思想，是学还是不学，用还是不用，正是不同的阶级立场的集中表现，不同世界观的具体反映。“多中心即无中心论”之所以反动，它的一个重要方面，就是它以资产阶级的恶劣态度来对抗毛泽东思想。持这种反动谬论的人，思想上是唯我主义，组织上是分裂主义，政治上是无政府主义，归根结底就是排斥、干扰和破坏革命队伍在毛泽东思想基础上的团结，妨碍无产阶级革命战士用毛泽东思想来统一认识，统一步伐，统一行动。他们口头上喊的是革命的词句，实际上争的是个人的、小山头的私利。他们学习毛泽东思想，只是为了装潢门面，并没有打算付诸实行。说到底，他们政治上乔装打扮，改头换面，接过革命的口号，肆意歪曲，其目的正是借以扰乱革命阵线，混淆视听，为其反对以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部这个唯一的领导中心制造社会舆论。因此，在当前无产阶级文化大革命进入夺取全面胜利的紧要关头，对毛主席的指示，对无产阶级司令部的战斗号令，是不是认真学，彻底用，就不是一个简单的学风问题，而是对伟大领袖毛主席和战无不胜的毛泽东思想真拥护还是假拥护的问题；是真革命、假革命，还是反革命的问题；是两个阶级、两条路线的大搏斗中站在哪一边的问题。
    我党几十年的斗争历史告诉我们，每当革命节节胜利的时候，垂死的、绝望的阶级敌人总是要寻隙破坏，以求一逞。当前的“多中心即无中心论”，就是破坏革命队伍团结的一支毒箭。这支箭毒性极大，它腐蚀人们灵魂，要你浑身麻痹，头脑膨胀。中了这种毒的人，若不及时消毒，就必定离开毛泽东思想的革命轨道，同阶级敌人同流合污。这种人，现在已经到了立即猛省的时候了，否则，沿着这条反动的路子滑下去，就要跌进资产阶级的泥坑，被革命人民唾弃。
    林副主席教导我们：
  “这次无产阶级文化大革命，最高司令是我们毛主席。毛主席是统帅。我们在伟大统帅的指挥下，好好听我们统帅毛主席的话，文化大革命一定能顺利发展，一定能取得伟大胜利！”
    我们革命战士对伟大统帅毛主席无限忠诚，对战无不胜的毛泽东思想无限信仰。对毛主席的指示，天天学，天天用，学一点就用一点，不走样，不含糊。毛主席指向哪里，我们就奔向哪里，永远团结在无产阶级司令部的周围，统一在毛泽东思想的基础上，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
