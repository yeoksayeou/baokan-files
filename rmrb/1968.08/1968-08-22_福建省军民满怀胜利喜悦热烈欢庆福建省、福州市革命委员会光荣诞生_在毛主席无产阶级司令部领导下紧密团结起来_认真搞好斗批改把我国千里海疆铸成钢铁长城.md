The heroic 17 million people of Fujian Province, who are fighting on the front lines of the country's coastal defense, are filled with revolutionary enthusiasm and the joy of victory. They enthusiastically hail the birth of the Fujian Provincial and Fuzhou Municipal Revolutionary Committees amidst the storm of class struggle. The revolutionary people of the entire province have resolutely declared that they will closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly execute the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and under the leadership of the provincial revolutionary committee, strengthen unity, jointly confront the enemy, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

On this day of great joy and celebration, from cities to rural areas, from forests to fishing grounds, the broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses in Fujian Province have held celebration and discussion meetings, enthusiastically hailing the birth of the Fujian Provincial and Fuzhou Municipal Revolutionary Committees, and enthusiastically singing the praises of "The Revolutionary Committee is good."

The newly born Fujian Provincial Revolutionary Committee held a meeting today where all members seriously studied Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions and the editorial "Unite and Struggle Together" from the People's Daily and the Liberation Army Daily. The members unanimously declared that they would closely unite around the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, unify their thoughts and actions under the orders of the proletarian headquarters, strengthen unity among the military and civilians of the entire province, strengthen the unity between the revolutionary committee and the broad revolutionary masses, strengthen unity within the revolutionary committee, lead the broad revolutionary masses to deeply and persistently carry out the revolutionary criticism, seriously clean up the class ranks, seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, strengthen preparedness, and be ready at any time to liberate Taiwan. Frontline female militia hero and vice chairman of the provincial revolutionary committee Hong Xiuxian and other comrades pointed out during the discussion that the establishment of the Fujian Provincial Revolutionary Committee is only the first step of a long march, and the tasks before us are extremely arduous. We must take Vice Chairman Lin as a shining example, further study and apply Chairman Mao's works, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, strengthen unity, jointly confront the enemy, and lead the 17 million people of Fujian Province to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The broad revolutionary workers, while enthusiastically hailing the birth of the Fujian Provincial and Fuzhou Municipal Revolutionary Committees, once again seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "Our country has 700 million people, and the working class is the leading class. We must fully give play to the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work. The working class must also continuously improve its political consciousness in the struggle." Many workers, recalling the practice of the Cultural Revolution over the past two years, deeply felt that the working class must be armed with Mao Zedong Thought and continuously improve its political consciousness in order to play a leading role in all work. They declared that they would quickly, together with the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, organize Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to go deep into schools and other units that have not yet carried out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, widely and deeply propagate and implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, further consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance, promote the cleaning up of class ranks, promote the educational revolution, and seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation. The revolutionary workers of the Fuzhou Grinding Wheel Factory, on the joyous day of celebrating the birth of the provincial and municipal revolutionary committees, organized a propaganda team to quickly spread the good news to the farmers in the suburbs. Many factory revolutionary workers also celebrated the birth of the provincial and municipal revolutionary committees with outstanding production achievements.

When the good news reached the countryside of the entire province, the broad poor and lower-middle peasants spread the word and rejoiced. The place where Chairman Mao personally presided over the Ancient Town Conference—Gutian Commune in Shanghang County—held a celebration meeting. Many old Red Guards recalled the scene of Chairman Mao convening the Ninth Party Representative Conference of the Fourth Red Army here and burst out with shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao!" They unanimously declared that they would hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry forward the spirit of the Ancient Town Conference resolution, emphasize proletarian politics, deeply and persistently carry out the revolutionary criticism, and thoroughly criticize and expose China's Khrushchev and his agents in Fujian. In the land revolution period, Chairman Mao praised Su'ao Village in Shanghang County as a model village in the Soviet area. Now known as Su'ao Commune, the broad poor and lower-middle peasants at the celebration meeting said with great excitement: Chairman Mao praised us as a model village in the Soviet area, which was a great encouragement to us. Today, at this critical moment of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must follow Chairman Mao's great teaching of "Do not rely on old merits, but create new ones," and with even greater revolutionary enthusiasm, grasp revolution and promote production, and achieve a double harvest of revolution and production.

The 41 heroic overseas Chinese youth who had fought resolutely against the reactionary forces of Indonesia have already settled down in the Quanshan Overseas Chinese Farm in Ninghua County, Fujian Province. On the day the Fujian Provincial Revolutionary Committee was born, they held a grand celebration meeting with all the returned overseas Chinese workers and organized a good news team to spread the good news to the nearby villagers of the people's commune. One of the 41 heroic overseas Chinese youth, Yu Yazhou, a member of the Fujian Provincial Revolutionary Committee, said: We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, firmly walk the road of uniting with workers and peasants, humbly learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants, and vow to make the Quanshan Overseas Chinese Farm a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

The heroic coastal defense militia, in the days of celebration, have further heightened their revolutionary vigilance, firmly gripping their guns, and are ready at any time to cooperate with the People's Liberation Army to annihilate any enemy that dares to invade. The militia on Xiamen Lingdou, on the front lines of the struggle against the enemy, polished their guns through the night, saying: The Fujian Provincial Revolutionary Committee is our proletarian revolutionary power. Whoever dares to sabotage the revolutionary committee, our gun barrels will not agree. The militia who grew up in the "August 23" artillery battle declared their resolve: We must carry forward the revolutionary spirit of the "August 23" artillery battle, guard the coastal defense, be lifelong red sentries of Chairman Mao, and contribute all our strength to liberate Taiwan, the sacred territory of our motherland, and to support the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation war and the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries in the world!

"When the military and civilians unite as one, who in the world can be our enemy?" The broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses in Fujian Province, at the moment of celebrating the birth of the provincial revolutionary committee, enthusiastically praised the great achievements of the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army in Fujian Province in defending the great socialist motherland, defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and carrying out the "three supports and two militaries" work. They are determined to raise the great banner of "supporting the military and loving the people" even higher, carry out larger-scale support-the-military activities, and turn the Fujian front into an impregnable iron wall.

The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed on the Fujian front line, filled with joy, enthusiastically hail the birth of the Fujian Provincial and Fuzhou Municipal Revolutionary Committees. The broad masses of soldiers resolutely declared that they would cherish and support the newly born revolutionary committees, together with the revolutionary people of the entire province, under the orders of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, closely unite, jointly confront the enemy, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

In recent days, the front-line positions, airfields, docks, and camps on the Fujian front line have been filled with joy. The broad masses of soldiers have held grand meetings to enthusiastically hail the establishment of the Fujian Provincial Revolutionary Committee. Along the thousand-mile coastal defense line, everywhere echoes "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao!" and the joyous singing of "The East Is Red."

Chairman Mao recently pointed out again: "Our country has 700 million people, and the working class is the leading class. We must fully give play to the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work. The working class must also continuously improve its political consciousness in the struggle." On this day of great joy, the soldiers of the three armies on the front line have seriously studied this great instruction, reviewed the two-year battle course of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and highly praised the great achievements created by the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The soldiers of the "Red Spearhead Company," "Red Fourth Company," and the Railway Engineering Corps stationed in Shunchang for supporting the left, who are fighting on the front lines of the "three supports and two militaries," excitedly said: The working class is the most loyal to Chairman Mao, the closest to Chairman Mao. In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it has played the great role of the leading class. We must listen to Chairman Mao's words and learn from the working class. They declared that they would seriously implement Chairman Mao's latest instruction, support the revolutionary actions and pioneering spirit of the working class, and better give play to the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work. The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams currently carrying out military training tasks in colleges and universities are determined to, under the leadership of the newly born revolutionary committees, closely rely on the working class, promote the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, promote the cleaning up of class ranks, promote the educational revolution, seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

In the days of celebrating the birth of the Fujian Provincial Revolutionary Committee, the soldiers repeatedly reviewed Chairman Mao's great teachings: "The core force leading our cause is the Communist Party of China." They said: Navigating the sea relies on the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. The establishment of the Fujian Provincial Revolutionary Committee is another great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, another great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and a victory of the unified understanding, unified steps, and unified actions of the military and civilians of the entire province under the great leader Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions and the wise leadership of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. They resolutely declared that in the future, they would better carry out the revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticize and expose China's Khrushchev and his agents in Fujian. The soldiers of the "Jinan Second Team" and the "Dajian Island Battle Model Company" said that at this moment of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must remember Chairman Mao's teaching of "strengthening discipline, invincible in revolution" even more, with high organizational discipline, quickly implement each of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and each battle order of the proletarian headquarters, and create new achievements in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The soldiers of the three armies on the Fujian front line, standing on the front line of national defense and shouldering heavy anti-enemy combat tasks, are determined to closely rely on the masses of the people, turn the thousand-mile coastal defense of the motherland into an iron wall. To defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the naval escort boat third squadron, which has achieved three victories in three battles in the Taiwan Strait, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's great teachings of "absolutely not relaxing one's fighting will" while celebrating the birth of the revolutionary committee, and declared that they would maintain a higher level of revolutionary vigilance, cherish and support the newly born revolutionary committee. The air force heroes guarding the front-line airspace and the thousands of military-civilian defense outposts in Xiamen, Huangqi, and other places are also determined to heighten their revolutionary vigilance, firmly guard their battle positions, resolutely smash all infiltration activities of the American Chiang bandits, and make new contributions to defending national defense, defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and liberating Taiwan, the sacred territory of our motherland.
