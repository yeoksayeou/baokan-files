Revolutionary cadres tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution are playing a backbone role in the revolutionary committees at various levels. They follow Chairman Mao's teachings, emphasize proletarian politics, and root themselves among the masses. They lead the broad revolutionary masses to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments and advance courageously along the revolutionary path opened by Chairman Mao!

Liu Jingxia, chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Beijing Shuifu Garden Middle School, is such a comrade.

Standing on the Front Line of Class Struggle

On March 27, 1967, the Revolutionary Committee of Shuifu Garden Middle School was born amidst the storm of class struggle. Revolutionary cadre representative Liu Jingxia was elected as the chairman of the committee. At the beginning, she had some internal struggles: during the early days of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, she had implemented the bourgeois reactionary line and was criticized by the masses. Now, her health was not good, could she really shoulder such a heavy burden? With the help of Political Commissar Yang Weizhang of the military training team stationed at the school, she reviewed the reality of class struggle during the Cultural Revolution and Chairman Mao's repeated teachings. She felt that as a revolutionary cadre, she must actively engage in the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads.

At that time, a handful of hidden class enemies attempted to overthrow the newly born revolutionary government. They exploited the anarchist thoughts and bourgeois factionalism of some masses, spreading poisonous winds and igniting evil fires, shouting slogans like "great unity is great compromise" and "three-in-one combination is three-in-one squeeze." They secretly organized factions, caused splits, and directed their attacks at the Revolutionary Committee.

In the fierce class struggle, Liu Jingxia firmly believed that the broad revolutionary masses were the most loyal to Chairman Mao and the most protective of the newly born revolutionary government. With Chairman Mao leading the way and the masses supporting, no difficulty was too great! She repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's works. First, she organized a Mao Zedong Thought study class within the Revolutionary Committee, leading everyone to connect the school's class struggle with Chairman Mao's great teachings on class and class struggle. She encouraged everyone to go deep among the masses, stand on the front line of class struggle, unite the masses, and fiercely strike down the class enemies.

A handful of class enemies, before their true faces were fully exposed, struggled desperately. They saw Liu Jingxia as a thorn in their eye and a splinter in their flesh, manipulating some deceived masses to attack her day and night.

Liu Jingxia firmly believed that the masses participating in the attacks were deceived. She always loudly read Chairman Mao's quotations, propagating Mao Zedong Thought to the masses. The more the enemies tried to disrupt her connection with the masses, the more she went among the masses. Wherever there were deceived masses, she went there to propagate Mao Zedong Thought and expose the enemies' plots. She always fought shoulder to shoulder with the broad revolutionary masses. At that time, her stomach pain and bloody stool were severe, and comrades advised her to go home and rest. She said, "At this critical moment of defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, I cannot leave the masses for a single moment. Leaving the masses is the greatest disloyalty to Chairman Mao!"

Under Liu Jingxia's leadership, the committee members went deep among the masses, widely organized Mao Zedong Thought study classes, studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions with the masses, recalled bitterness and sweetness together, exposed the class enemies' plots, carried out revolutionary criticism, united and helped the deceived masses, and formed a vast revolutionary army. The broad masses heightened their class struggle awareness, quickly exposed a handful of class enemies, and defended the newly born revolutionary government.

Heart to Heart with the Broad Masses

In the sharp and fierce class struggle, Liu Jingxia followed Chairman Mao's great teaching of "we must not for a single moment be separated from the masses," fighting and living with the masses, establishing a flesh-and-blood connection. The more than 1,300 teachers and staff of Shuifu Garden Middle School, whoever had ideological problems or work difficulties, she knew them almost perfectly. She often talked heart to heart with the masses until late at night, helping them solve problems with Mao Zedong Thought.

Liu Jingxia paid great attention to doing ideological work for those class brothers who had made mistakes, warmly helping them correct their mistakes. Student Wang Baolu of Class 2(6) was a revolutionary little fighter in the early days of the movement. Later, due to being deceived by class enemies, he did many wrong things. Many cadres and masses found him troublesome. Liu Jingxia, after a comprehensive analysis, believed that Wang Baolu was fundamentally good. As long as she helped him wholeheartedly, he would definitely change. At first, Wang Baolu always avoided her. Liu Jingxia managed to call Wang Baolu into the room, but before she could speak, Wang Baolu blurted out, "You're a river-raised person, why do you meddle so much?" and then pushed the door hard and ran away. Someone suggested, "Forget it, don't bother with him!" Liu Jingxia said, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Communist Party members' attitude towards backward people is not to despise them, look down upon them, but to approach them, unite with them, persuade them, and encourage them to advance.' Uniting with deceived class brothers is an important aspect of the Revolutionary Committee's connection with the masses. The more we unite with the masses, the more strength we have to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line."

Several times, Liu Jingxia found Wang Baolu, but Wang Baolu still waved his hand and walked away without looking back. Some committee members also got impatient, saying, "Old Liu, why do you keep begging him? As long as we do the work of the broad masses well, we can still make the revolution without him." Liu Jingxia felt that some comrades had not yet raised the issue of connecting with the masses to the height of the struggle between the two lines, so she said, "In the early days of the movement, I implemented the bourgeois reactionary line, and the masses criticized and helped me to quickly return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Now, Wang Baolu has deviated from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, can I just watch and do nothing? Our work with Wang Baolu is not just about one person's problem, but it relates to whether we implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line or not."

Liu Jingxia insisted on patiently and meticulously doing Wang Baolu's work, talking wherever she met him, and talking wherever she went. Finally, she touched Wang Baolu. He began to have some understanding of his mistakes. At this time, the committee members were about to organize a study class. They, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "organizing study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes," let Wang Baolu participate in this study class. In the study class, the committee members all enthusiastically helped him, and Liu Jingxia sincerely checked her own shortcomings in helping students who had made mistakes. Wang Baolu could no longer hold back, he deeply checked his mistakes, and expressed his determination to be a good Red Guard of Chairman Mao. From then on, he studied Mao Zedong Thought diligently and became a backbone of Class 2(6). Wang Baolu's change deeply educated the committee members, and they proactively connected with the broad masses, making the Revolutionary Committee deeply rooted among the masses.

Warmly Helping New Cadres

The members of the Revolutionary Committee of Shuifu Garden Middle School were mostly young students in their late teens. Liu Jingxia saw that they were all full of energy and vigor, and she liked them from the bottom of her heart. She humbly learned from the revolutionary youngsters and respected their opinions. At the same time, she followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "all old cadres should welcome new cadres with great enthusiasm and care for new cadres," always enthusiastically helping new cadres and caring for their growth. She regarded cultivating new cadres as a major political task. In her work, she both boldly used them and strictly demanded of them.

There was a new cadre in the Revolutionary Committee who thought that since he came from the masses, he had no problem of being detached from the masses, so he did not pay much attention to connecting with the masses in his work. Thus, he gradually became distant from the masses. Liu Jingxia studied Chairman Mao's teachings on the mass line with him, pointing out that the committee members closely connecting with the masses was an important guarantee for the revolutionary government to never change color and an important guarantee for the revolutionary government to always be in the hands of the proletarian revolutionary faction. As representatives of the revolutionary masses, they must always represent the interests of the masses. The position may change, the status may be high, but the essence of connecting with the masses must not change. This new cadre, under Liu Jingxia's help, actively opened his heart to the masses and corrected his shortcomings.

Under Liu Jingxia's leadership and help, the committee members closely connected with the masses, striving to achieve ideological revolutionization. The mass foundation of the school's Revolutionary Committee became increasingly solid, and in the great storms of class struggle, it showed increasingly great revolutionary power. The broad revolutionary masses unanimously praised: The Revolutionary Committee is good!

　　站在最前线　扎根群众中
　　——记北京帅府园中学革命委员会主任刘静霞
    经过无产阶级文化大革命锤炼的广大革命干部，在各级革命委员会中正在发挥着骨干作用。他们遵循毛主席的教导，突出无产阶级政治，扎根在群众之中，带领广大革命群众紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，沿着毛主席开辟的革命航道奋勇前进！
    北京帅府园中学革命委员会主任刘静霞，就是这样一位同志。
　　站在阶级斗争最前线
    一九六七年三月二十七日，帅府园中学革命委员会在阶级斗争的暴风雨中诞生了。革命干部代表刘静霞被选为革委会主任。开始，她有过思想斗争：在无产阶级文化大革命初期，她执行过资产阶级反动路线，受到群众的批判，现在自己身体又不好，这么重的担子挑得起吗？在驻校军训团政委杨维章的帮助下，她回顾文化大革命中阶级斗争的现实，回顾文化大革命中毛主席的谆谆教导，感到作为一个革命干部，必须积极投入两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争中去。
    当时，一小撮暗藏的阶级敌人妄图颠覆新生的革命政权，利用部分群众的无政府主义思想和资产阶级派性，煽阴风，点邪火，叫喊什么“大联合是大凑合”，“三结合是三捏合”，暗中拉队伍，闹分裂，把矛头直指革委会。
    在激烈的阶级斗争中，刘静霞坚信广大革命群众最忠于毛主席，最爱护和支持新生的革命政权。有毛主席引路，有群众撑腰，天大的困难也不怕！一次又一次地学习毛主席著作。首先在革委会内部举办毛泽东思想学习班，组织大家联系学校阶级斗争实际，反复学习毛主席关于阶级、阶级斗争的伟大教导，鼓励大家深入群众，站在阶级斗争最前线，团结群众，狠狠地打击阶级敌人。
    一小撮阶级敌人趁自己面目还没有完全暴露，拚命地垂死挣扎。他们把刘静霞看作眼中钉，肉中刺，操纵部分受蒙蔽的群众日夜对她轮番围攻。
    刘静霞坚信参加围攻的群众是受蒙蔽的，她始终高声朗读毛主席语录，向群众宣传毛泽东思想。敌人越是破坏她和群众的联系，她就越到群众中去。哪里有受蒙蔽的群众，她就到哪里宣传毛泽东思想，揭露敌人的阴谋。她始终和广大革命群众肩并肩战斗在一起。当时，她的胃痛和便血严重发作，同志们劝她回家休息。她说：“在捍卫毛主席革命路线的关键时刻，我一刻也不能离开群众。离开群众，就是对毛主席的最大不忠！”
    在刘静霞同志带动下，革委会委员们深入群众，普遍开办毛泽东思想学习班，同群众一起学习毛主席最新指示，一起忆苦思甜，一起揭露阶级敌人的阴谋，一起开展革命大批判，团结帮助受蒙蔽群众，组成浩浩荡荡的革命大军。广大群众提高了阶级斗争觉悟，很快揪出了一小撮阶级敌人，保卫了新生的革命政权。
    和广大群众心贴心
    在尖锐、激烈的阶级斗争中，刘静霞遵照毛主席“我们不要有一时一刻脱离群众”的伟大教导，和群众战斗在一起，生活在一起，建立了血肉般的联系。帅府园中学的一千三百多名师生员工，谁有啥思想问题，哪个工作有困难，她都摸个八九不离十。她常常和群众谈心到深夜，帮助群众用毛泽东思想解决问题。
    刘静霞很注意对那些犯了错误的阶级兄弟做思想工作，热情地帮助他们改正错误。二（六）班学生王保尔，运动初期，是一个革命小闯将，后来由于受阶级敌人的蒙蔽，干了不少错事。不少干部和群众对他很头痛。刘静霞经过全面分析，认为王保尔本质是好的，只要满腔热情地帮助他，一定会转变过来。一开始，王保尔总是躲闪着她。刘静霞好不容易把王保尔叫到屋里，还未等她开口，王保尔就劈头一句：“你是吃河水长大的，干嘛管得那么宽？”说罢，把门狠劲一推就跑了。有人主张：算了吧，别管他了！刘静霞说：“毛主席教导我们：‘共产党员对于落后的人们的态度，不是轻视他们，看不起他们，而是亲近他们，团结他们，说服他们，鼓励他们前进。’团结受蒙蔽的阶级兄弟，是革委会联系群众的一个重要方面。我们多争取团结一个群众，就多一分捍卫毛主席革命路线的力量。”
    一连几次，刘静霞找到王保尔，王保尔还是把手一摆，头也不回地走了。革委会有的委员也不耐烦了，说：“老刘，你何必三番五次地央求他呢？只要咱把广大群众的工作做好了，缺他一个也照样干革命。”刘静霞感到有些同志还没有把联系群众提到两条路线斗争的高度来认识，就说：“运动初期我执行了资产阶级反动路线，群众批判帮助我，是为了让我迅速回到毛主席的革命路线上来。现在，王保尔偏离了毛主席的革命路线，我难道能看着不管吗？我们做王保尔的工作，不是对一个人的问题，而是关系到我们执行不执行毛主席革命路线的大问题。”
    刘静霞坚持耐心细致地做王保尔的工作，哪里碰到哪里谈，走到哪里谈到哪里，终于感动了王保尔。他对自己错误开始有些认识。这时，革委会成员正要办学习班。他们根据毛主席的“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的教导，让王保尔参加了这期学习班。在学习班上，革委会成员都热情地帮助他，刘静霞还诚恳地检查了自己对犯错误同学帮助得不够的缺点。王保尔再也憋不住了，他沉痛地检查了自己的错误，表示坚决当好毛主席的红卫兵。从此，他努力学习毛泽东思想，成了二（六）班的骨干。王保尔的转变，深深教育了革委会成员，他们更主动地联系广大群众，使革委会深深扎根于群众之中。
    热情帮助新干部
    帅府园中学革委会成员，大部分是十七八岁的青年学生。刘静霞看到他们个个生龙活虎，朝气蓬勃，打心眼里喜欢。她虚心地向革命小将学习，尊重他们的意见。同时，她按照毛主席“一切老干部应该以极大的热忱欢迎新干部，关心新干部”的教导，总是满腔热情地帮助新干部，关心他们的成长。她把培养新干部作为一项重大的政治任务。在工作中既大胆地使用他们，又严格地要求他们。
    革委会有个新干部，认为自己是从群众中来的，不存在什么脱离群众的问题，工作中就不大注意联系群众。这样，就逐渐和群众疏远了。刘静霞就同他一起学习毛主席关于群众路线的教导，指出革委会成员紧密联系群众，是使革命政权永不变色的重要保证，是使革命政权永远掌握在无产阶级革命派手里的重要保证。作为革命群众的代表，要时时刻刻代表群众的利益。职务变了，地位高了，联系群众的本色不能变。这个新干部在刘静霞的帮助下，主动向群众交心，改正了自己的缺点。
    在刘静霞的带动和帮助下，革委会的成员密切联系群众，努力实现思想革命化，校革委会群众基础越来越坚实，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中越来越显示出巨大的革命威力。广大革命群众齐声高赞：革命委员会好！　本报通讯员
