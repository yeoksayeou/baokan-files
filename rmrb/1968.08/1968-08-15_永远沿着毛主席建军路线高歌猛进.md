Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The correct political and military line is not produced and developed naturally and peacefully, but is produced and developed through struggle." In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we deeply feel that: the process of creating a Four Good Unit is the process of Chairman Mao's military line defeating the bourgeois military line. To successfully carry out the Four Good Unit movement, we must firmly grasp the struggle between the two lines, raise our awareness of the line struggle, and resolutely march forward along Chairman Mao's military line. Only in this way can we create a truly excellent Four Good Unit.

Before 1963, we were once influenced by the bourgeois military line, relaxed our emphasis on proletarian politics, and failed to be rated as a Four Good Unit for three years. "Mistakes and setbacks have taught us, making us somewhat wiser. We have done things better." In 1964, when the counter-revolutionary revisionist Ro Ruiqing spread the wind of large-scale military exercises, we took a stance of resistance. That year, we followed the instructions of Vice Chairman Lin, launched a mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, firmly set our compass on Chairman Mao's military line, thoroughly smashed the bourgeois military line, and emphasized the implementation of the Four Firsts. The political and ideological face of the troops underwent a profound change. From 1965 onwards, we were consecutively rated as a Four Good Unit for three years.

Breaking the underwater "forbidden zone," steering with Chairman Mao's military line

Whether to emphasize proletarian politics or military affairs is the fundamental difference between Chairman Mao's military line and the bourgeois military line, and it is also the key issue that must be resolved first in the movement to create a Four Good Unit. We feel that to create an excellent Four Good Unit, we must firmly emphasize proletarian politics and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought in all work.

In the past, China's Khrushchev and Peng Dehuai, Luo Ruiqing fiercely opposed our submarine troops from carrying out the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and desperately pushed the bourgeois military line of "military first" and "technology first." When we broke through their numerous obstacles on land and launched a mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, they created an underwater "forbidden zone" and opposed us from studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. They were truly extreme and reactionary!

Father and mother are not as dear as Chairman Mao. Ten thousand treasures, a million treasures, Mao Zedong Thought is priceless. In 1965, when Vice Chairman Lin's instructions on emphasizing proletarian politics reached the boat, the comrades on our boat, with the deepest proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, with boundless love for the great Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's military line, decided to break the underwater "forbidden zone" and let the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought illuminate the seabed. We hung portraits of Chairman Mao and quotations from Chairman Mao in every compartment, making the eternal red sun rise underwater. We turned every voyage into a process of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, steering with Chairman Mao's military thoughts and military line.

In the past, shift changes were made according to the "regulations" brought from abroad by the counter-revolutionary revisionists Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing, reciting a few rigid foreign phrases. Now, everyone selects shining quotations from Chairman Mao for each other based on the other's active thoughts and matters to be noted in the next shift, effectively promoting ideological revolutionization and combat readiness training. Once, soldier Liu Puwu, after finishing his shift, had already gone to bed. Remembering the quotation from Chairman Mao given to him by the comrade from the previous shift, "Our responsibility is to the people," he realized that he had not carefully checked the machinery during the shift change. He immediately returned to his post and carefully checked the machine, discovering a fault and preventing a potential accident. Now, everyone regards standing a good shift, charging a good battery, and starting a machine well as a process of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, as a concrete manifestation of being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's military line.

During navigation, we followed Vice Chairman Lin's instructions on "studying Chairman Mao's works, bringing problems to study, actively studying and applying, combining study and use, studying urgently needed things first, seeing results immediately, and focusing on the 'use' aspect," studying what we do and using what we study. Once, we encountered a typhoon of level 9 during navigation. The exhaust pipe's outer baffle malfunctioned, and if not removed in time, it would seriously affect the mission. The party branch decided to surface at night for repairs. However, the giant waves were like small mountains, one after another, pressing down on the boat, making it difficult for people to stand on the fish-like deck. What to do? Chairman Mao teaches us: "This army has the spirit of advancing without fear of sacrifice, it will overcome all enemies and will never be subdued by enemies." The wheel machine sergeant major Zheng Kuiqiang and his comrades, who were responsible for the repair task, studied Chairman Mao's teachings, gained boundless courage and strength. They held hands and bravely stepped onto the deck. Giant waves came one after another, sometimes burying them underwater. Everyone shouted Chairman Mao's teachings: "With determination, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory," and fought tenaciously with the wind and waves. After a struggle, they finally conquered the level 9 winds and waves and removed the fault.

Studying Chairman Mao's works underwater will encounter many difficulties. Cadres and soldiers thought of many ways to make the study better. The noise from the machines in the engine room was too loud, making it difficult to hear each other speak. The soldiers created various gestures to express Chairman Mao's quotations and passed on the great commander Mao's orders to each other. The soldiers also organized a Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team, performed programs underwater, and sent the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to every compartment and post. We also overcame various difficulties and listened to Beijing Radio underwater, listening to the latest instructions from the great leader Chairman Mao. Comrades said: "Over mountains, over oceans, over air, our hearts are forever connected with Chairman Mao!"

Vice Chairman Lin said: "When Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the broad masses, it will become an endless force, becoming an atomic bomb of immense power." Our achievements in carrying out the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works underwater are increasing, everyone's awareness of the line struggle is increasing, and all work is making significant progress. Spirit turns into matter, matter turns into spirit, constantly pushing the movement to create a Four Good Unit to a new level.

Smashing the "weapon-only" theory, relying on Chairman Mao's military line to make a name in the sea

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Weapons are an important factor in war, but not the decisive factor. The decisive factor is people, not things." However, for a long time, the counter-revolutionary revisionist Luo Ruiqing used "the complex technical equipment of the navy" as an excuse to oppose Chairman Mao's military line and Vice Chairman Lin's Four Firsts, attempting to drag us into the quagmire of the bourgeois "weapon-only" theory. In recent years, in the movement to create a Four Good Unit, we have used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to launch a continuous attack on the bourgeois "weapon-only" theory, firmly establishing Chairman Mao's military line and Vice Chairman Lin's Four Firsts based on Chairman Mao's military line, constantly raising our awareness of the line struggle.

Once, we were to carry out a long-distance patrol mission. However, the boat had reached the mid-term repair period, and according to the foreign regulations, to go to sea, we had to change the boat. Should we change or not? Comrades studied Chairman Mao's relevant teachings, analyzed and studied the situation of our boat, and firmly answered: "No change!" The ship's affairs sergeant major Jing Pinghai said: "Is it the boat that controls the people, or the people that control the boat? I have been on the 125 boat for ten years and am familiar with its temperament. As long as the people are strong, the boat will definitely be reliable." The mechanical engineer Fang Tingfang said: "This mission is to defend Chairman Mao's military line and defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Even if there are enormous difficulties, we can overcome them." Everyone followed Chairman Mao's teachings on "not fighting unprepared battles," combining revolutionary spirit and scientific attitude, quickly completing a series of preparatory work. The ship's affairs class worked day and night for three days, repairing the hydraulic pump seven times. The mechanical department only took seven days to repair more than 200 items that originally needed more than 20 days to repair.

During the long-distance voyage, the elevator rudder malfunctioned. According to the foreign regulations, the boat must surface or sink to the bottom of the sea to repair. We decided to thoroughly smash this foreign framework. Comrades said: whether surfacing or sinking to the bottom of the sea, both mean withdrawing from the battle, which means surrendering to the bourgeois military line. To defend Chairman Mao's military line, we must not withdraw from the battle. The party branch decisively decided: to navigate and repair at the same time. In the vast sea, we relied on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to repair the elevator rudder and maintain the balance of the submarine.

Another long-distance voyage, the boat captain required the two navigators to ensure the boat's position accurately during the submerged navigation. At the beginning, the navigators proposed that to ensure the boat's position, they had to surface every night to determine the boat's position once using celestial navigation. The characteristic of a submarine is to be hidden, surfacing will expose the target, how can this be done? We and the navigators studied Chairman Mao's teachings on politics being the commander and the soul, inspiring them to consider problems more from a political perspective, pointing out that emphasizing technology one-sidedly is not in line with Chairman Mao's teachings. The two navigators expressed that to defend Chairman Mao's military line and defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they must think of every possible way to ensure that our boat operates accurately in the designated position. They continuously worked for nine days and nine nights, always holding pencils and rulers, lying on the sea map, calculating based on navigation time, speed, direction, and water flow conditions. The result was extremely accurate. The two navigators happily said: "This is the great victory of Chairman Mao's military line!"

In this way, we followed Chairman Mao's teachings, emphasized proletarian politics, fully played the role of people, smashed the bourgeois "weapon-only" theory, and relied on Chairman Mao's military line to make a name in the sea.

Overthrowing the crawling theory, advancing at full speed under the shining light of Chairman Mao's military line

Good military training is one aspect of creating a Four Good Unit. In dealing with military training, there has always been a fierce struggle between the two lines. China's Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionists Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing copied countless rules and regulations from foreign revisionist military textbooks, obstructing our young people's submarine troops from growing rapidly, attempting to make us follow behind the "foreigners" step by step. The rules and regulations they copied stipulate that submarine soldiers must study more than a dozen courses before boarding the boat, and after boarding, they must "study for a year, observe for two years, and only then can they start working." Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to firmly fight against the bourgeois crawling theory.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "We cannot follow the old path of technological development of all countries in the world, following behind others step by step." "Learning war from war—this is our main method.... Revolutionary war is the people's business, often not learning well first and then doing, but doing and then learning, doing is learning." Comrades studied Chairman Mao's teachings, deeply realizing that the crawling theory promoted by China's Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionists Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing is to make us follow the old path of technological development of all countries in the world, not allowing us to master the skills of serving the people more quickly. Their training methods are not training people but training puppets. Everyone expressed that they must defend Chairman Mao's military line with a red heart, be self-reliant, and work hard to master excellent skills to defeat the enemy as quickly as possible.

At sea, all comrades on the boat gave a fatal blow to the crawling theory promoted by China's Khrushchev, Peng Dehuai, and Luo Ruiqing with their actual actions. In the past, the technology of operating the elevator rudder was exaggerated, and only the boatswain was allowed to operate it without permission. When new soldiers started learning to operate the elevator rudder, they were not encouraged ideologically, but were first told how complex operating the elevator rudder is and the serious consequences of operating it poorly, scaring the new soldiers into a cold sweat before they even started practicing. Now, as soon as new soldiers board the boat, we first organize them to study Chairman Mao's works with questions, firmly grasp and emphasize active thoughts, and under the correct guidance of cadres, let them practice freely. According to Chairman Mao's teachings on "revolutionizing education," we boldly reform training and overthrow the crawling theory. The new sonar soldier Xiao Hanliang initially heard that sonar technology is very complex and felt it was mysterious, not even daring to enter the sonar room. Sergeant Major Yang Yonglu took the initiative to study Chairman Mao's quotations with him, dispelling his concerns and boosting his courage. Whenever he heard the noise of various ships, he let Xiao Hanliang listen and identify what the target was. After one long-distance voyage, Xiao Hanliang quickly mastered general technology and accurately discovered targets several times. He said: "In the past, I didn't dare to enter the sonar room because I was frightened by the bourgeois rules and regulations. Now we have overthrown the bourgeois crawling theory and occupied this position. In the future, I will firmly defend Chairman Mao's military line here and not retreat half a step!" In this way, a batch of new soldiers who just boarded the boat, after one long-distance voyage training, can all relatively well undertake general shift duties. Old comrades sighed to their new comrades: "You are really fortunate! You have completed in one long-distance voyage what we could not complete in several years in the past!"

In recent years, in addition to fighting against the bourgeois military line on some important issues, since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have continuously and thoroughly criticized China's Khrushchev and Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing. The practice of struggle has made us deeply feel that: we must fiercely fight and deeply criticize the bourgeois military line. The fiercer the fight, the deeper the criticism, the clearer the line of struggle between the two lines will be, the higher the awareness of the line struggle will be, and the Four Good Unit movement will continuously reach new levels.

"Many things are urgent." The new situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which is continuously deepening and developing, puts forward higher and higher requirements for the movement to create a Four Good Unit. We are determined to raise the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought higher, firmly grasp the education of the struggle between the two lines in the movement to create a Four Good Unit, continuously raise the cadres and soldiers' class struggle consciousness and awareness of the line struggle, and forever resolutely march forward along Chairman Mao's military line.

　　永远沿着毛主席建军路线高歌猛进
　　中国人民解放军北海舰队125潜水艇党支部
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“正确的政治的和军事的路线，不是自然地平安地产生和发展起来的，而是从斗争中产生和发展起来的。”在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，我们深深体会到：创造四好连队的过程，就是毛主席的建军路线战胜资产阶级军事路线的过程。要胜利地开展四好连队运动，就必须狠抓两条路线斗争教育，把我们的路线斗争觉悟提得高高的，坚定不移地沿着毛主席的建军路线奋勇前进。这样，才能创造出真正过得硬的四好连队。
    一九六三年以前，我们曾一度受资产阶级军事路线的影响，放松了突出无产阶级政治，三年没有评上四好单位。“错误和挫折教训了我们，使我们比较地聪明起来了，我们的事情就办得好一些。”一九六四年，反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿刮起大比武妖风时，我们采取了抵制的态度。这一年，我们遵照林副主席的指示，大抓部队活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，把“罗经”（指南针）牢牢地定在毛主席的建军路线上，大破资产阶级军事路线，大抓四个第一的落实，部队的政治思想面貌发生了深刻的变化。从一九六五年起，连续三年被评为四好单位。
    大破水下“禁区”，用毛主席建军路线指挥航行
    突出无产阶级政治，还是突出军事，这是毛主席的建军路线与资产阶级军事路线的根本分歧，也是在创造四好连队运动中必须首先解决的关键问题。我们体会到，要创造出过硬的四好连队，必须在一切工作中坚定不移地突出无产阶级政治，突出战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    过去，中国赫鲁晓夫和彭德怀、罗瑞卿，疯狂地反对我们潜艇部队开展活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，拚命地推行“军事第一”、“技术第一”的资产阶级军事路线。当我们在陆地上冲破了他们的重重阻挠，掀起了活学活用毛泽东思想群众运动的热潮的时候，他们又制造水下“禁区”，反对我们活学活用毛泽东思想。真是疯狂至极！反动透顶！
    爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲，千宝万宝毛泽东思想是无价之宝。在一九六五年，当林副主席关于突出无产阶级政治的指示传达到艇上的时候，我们艇上的同志怀着对伟大领袖毛主席最深厚的无产阶级感情，怀着对伟大的毛泽东思想、毛主席建军路线的无比热爱，下决心打破水下“禁区”，让毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉照亮海底。我们在各个舱室挂上了毛主席像和毛主席语录，使水下升起了永远不落的红太阳。我们把每一次出海执行任务的过程，当作活学活用毛泽东思想的过程，用毛主席的建军思想和建军路线指挥航行。
    过去交接更，都是根据反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿从外国搬来的“规定”，背几句僵死的外来语。现在，大家针对对方的活思想和下一更应该注意的事项，彼此选送金光闪闪的毛主席语录，有力地促进了思想革命化，促进了战备训练。一次，战士刘丕武交完更后，已经上床躺下了，想起上一更的同志送给他的毛主席语录：“我们的责任，是向人民负责”，发现自己在交更时没有认真地检查机械。于是，立即回到战位，对机器进行了仔细的检查，结果发现了一个故障，避免了一个可能发生的事故。现在，大家都把值好一次更，充好一次电，启动好一次机器，看作是活学活用毛主席著作的过程，看作是无限忠于毛主席建军路线的具体表现。
    在航行中，我们遵照林副主席关于“学习毛主席著作，要带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影，在‘用’字上狠下功夫”的指示，干什么学什么，学用一致，学一点就用一点。有一次，我们在航行途中遇上了九级台风。排气管外挡板出了故障，如不及时排除，就要严重地影响执行任务。党支部决定在夜里上浮抢修。可是，巨大的浪头象小山一样一个一个地向艇上压来，在鱼背似的甲板上很难站得住人。怎么办？毛主席教导我们：“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。”担任抢修任务的轮机军士长郑奎祥等同志学习了毛主席的教导，增添了无穷的勇气和力量。他们手牵着手，勇气百倍地踏上了甲板。巨大的浪头接二连三地打来，有时把他们埋在水下。大家高呼着伟大领袖毛主席教导的“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，和风浪作顽强斗争。经过一番搏斗，终于征服了九级风浪，排除了故障。
    在水下学习毛主席著作，会遇到很多困难。干部战士想出很多办法，把学习搞得更好。轮机舱里机器声音太大，说话听不清楚，战士们创造了能表达毛主席语录的各种手势，互相传送伟大统帅毛主席的命令。战士们还组织起毛泽东思想宣传队，在水下编演节目，把战无不胜的毛泽东思想送到每一个舱室和战位。我们还克服了种种困难，在水下收听北京广播，收听伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示。同志们说：“隔高山，隔海洋，隔空气，我们的心永远和毛主席紧紧连在一起！”
    林副主席说：“毛泽东思想为广大群众所掌握，就会变成无穷无尽的力量，变成威力无比的精神原子弹。”我们在水下开展活学活用毛主席著作群众运动的成绩越来越大，大家的路线斗争觉悟越来越高，各项工作都有明显的进步。精神变物质，物质变精神，不断地把创造四好连队运动推向新水平。
    大破“唯武器”论，靠毛主席建军路线在海上杀出威风
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“武器是战争的重要的因素，但不是决定的因素，决定的因素是人不是物。”但是，长期以来，反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿以“海军的技术装备复杂”为借口，同毛主席的建军路线相对抗，和林副主席提出的四个第一相对抗，妄图把我们拖进资产阶级“唯武器”论的泥坑。几年来，在创造四好连队运动中，我们以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，对资产阶级的“唯武器”论，展开持续不断的进攻，大立毛主席的建军路线，大立林副主席根据毛主席建军路线提出的四个第一，不断地提高自己的路线斗争觉悟。
    有一次，我们要执行远航巡逻任务。但是，艇已经到了中修期，按照洋框框规定，要出海，就得换艇。究竟换不换呢？同志们学习了毛主席的有关教导，分析研究了本艇的情况，坚决地回答：“不换！”舰务军士长景平海说：“究竟是人归艇管，还是艇归人管？我在一二五艇干了十年，熟悉它的脾气，只要人过得硬，艇就一定靠得住。”机电长方廷芳说：“这次执行任务，是保卫毛主席的建军路线，保卫无产阶级文化大革命，即使有天大的困难，我们也能够克服。”大家遵照毛主席关于“不打无准备之仗”的教导，把革命气概和科学态度结合起来，迅速做好了一系列准备工作。舰务班苦战三昼夜，把液压泵检修了七次，机电部门仅用七天的时间，就修好了原来需要二十多天才能检修完的二百多个项目。
    在远航中，升降舵发生了故障。按照洋框框规定，艇必须浮出水面或坐沉海底才能进行修理。我们决定彻底砸烂这个洋框框。同志们说：不管浮出水面还是坐沉海底，都等于退出战斗，就意味着向资产阶级军事路线投降。为了保卫毛主席的建军路线，我们决不能退出战斗。党支部果断地作出决定：一面航行，一面检修。在茫茫的大海里，我们依靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，修好了升降舵，保持了潜艇的平衡。
    又一次远航，艇长要求两位航海长在潜航过程中，要准确地保证艇位。开始，航海长提出，要保证艇位，就得每天晚上浮出水面，天文测艇位一次。潜艇的特点就是隐蔽，浮出水面就会暴露目标，这怎么行呢？我们和航海长一起学习毛主席关于政治是统帅，是灵魂的教导，启发他们多从政治上考虑问题，指出片面强调技术，是不符合毛主席教导的。两位航海长表示，为了保卫毛主席的建军路线，保卫无产阶级文化大革命，一定要想尽一切办法，保证我们艇准确地活动在指定的位置上。他们连续九天九夜，一直拿着铅笔、尺子，趴在海图上，根据航行时间、速度、航向和水流情况进行推算。结果艇位极为准确。两位航海长都高兴地说：“这是毛主席建军路线的伟大胜利！”
    就这样，我们遵照毛主席的教导，突出无产阶级政治，充分发挥了人的作用，粉碎了资产阶级“唯武器”论，依靠毛主席的建军路线在大海里杀出了威风。
    打倒爬行主义，在毛主席建军路线的光辉照耀下全速前进
    军事训练好，是创造四好连队的一个方面。在对待军事训练上一直贯穿着两条路线的激烈斗争。中国赫鲁晓夫以及反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿从外国修正主义军事教科书中，抄来数不清的清规戒律，阻碍我们年青的人民潜艇部队迅速成长，妄图让我们跟在“洋人”的屁股后面一步一步地爬行。他们抄来的洋条条规定，潜艇兵必须学习十几门课程才能上艇，上艇以后，又要“一年学，两年看，三年才能学着干”。无产阶级文化大革命以来，我们以毛泽东思想为武器，向资产阶级的爬行主义进行了坚决斗争。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“我们不能走世界各国技术发展的老路，跟在别人后面一步一步地爬行。”“从战争学习战争——这是我们的主要方法。……革命战争是民众的事，常常不是先学好了再干，而是干起来再学习，干就是学习。”同志们学习了毛主席的教导，深刻认识到，中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿推行的爬行主义，就是妄图要我们走世界各国技术发展的老路，不让我们更快地掌握为人民服务的本领。他们的训练方法，不是训练人而是训练木偶的方法。大家表示，一定要怀着保卫毛主席建军路线的红心，自力更生，艰苦奋斗，以最快的速度掌握过硬的杀敌本领。
    在海上，全艇同志以实际行动，给中国赫鲁晓夫、彭德怀、罗瑞卿推行的爬行主义以致命的打击。过去，操升降舵的技术被吹得神乎其神，除了水手长以外，不经允许谁也不准动。新战士开始学习操升降舵，不是从思想上鼓励他们，而是首先给他们讲一通操升降舵如何复杂，操不好后果如何严重，还没有等到操练，就把新战士吓了一头汗。现在，新战士一上艇，我们首先组织他们带着问题学习毛主席著作，大抓狠抓活思想，在干部的正确指导下，放手让他们操练。根据毛主席关于“教育要革命”的教导，大胆改革训练，打倒爬行主义。新上艇的声纳兵肖汉良，开始听说声纳技术很复杂，感到神秘得不得了，连声纳室都不敢进。军士长杨永录就主动和他一起学习毛主席语录，消除他的顾虑，提高他的勇气。每逢听到各种船只的骚音，就让肖汉良听一听，辨别一下是什么目标。通过一次远航，肖汉良很快学会了一般技术，好几次都准确地发现了目标。他说：“我过去不敢进声纳室，是被资产阶级的洋条条吓住了，现在我们打倒了资产阶级的爬行主义，占领了这块阵地，今后，我就要在这里坚决捍卫毛主席的建军路线，半步也不能退让！”就这样，新上艇的一批战士，通过一次远航锻炼，都能较好地担任一般值更任务。老同志对新战友感慨地说：“你们真幸福啊！一次远航就走完了我们过去几年没有走完的路程！”
    几年来，我们除了在上面一些重要问题上，同资产阶级军事路线进行针锋相对的斗争外，无产阶级文化大革命以来，还持续不断地对中国赫鲁晓夫以及彭德怀、罗瑞卿开展了革命的大批判。斗争的实践，使我们深深体会到：对资产阶级军事路线，必须狠狠地斗，深深地批。斗得越狠，批得越深，两条路线斗争的界线就划得越清，路线斗争觉悟就会提得越高，四好连队运动就会不断提高到新的水平。
    “多少事，从来急”。无产阶级文化大革命不断深入发展着的新形势，对创造四好连队运动提出了越来越高的要求。我们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在创造四好连队运动中狠抓两条路线斗争教育，不断提高干部战士的阶级斗争观念和路线斗争觉悟，永远坚定地沿着毛主席建军路线高歌猛进。
