	Rome, August 13 (New China News Agency) – Earthquake victims in Sicily, Italy, have been staging large-scale protests recently, angrily condemning the Italian government's indifferent attitude towards their plight. Thousands of victims blocked the roads from Alcamo to Castelvetrano on August 12, paralyzing traffic for the entire day.

	The large island of Sicily in the Mediterranean Sea experienced a severe earthquake in January, resulting in over 250 deaths and the collapse of numerous buildings, leaving many workers homeless. For more than half a year, the Italian government has turned a blind eye to the suffering of the earthquake victims. Currently, tens of thousands of workers are still forced to live in tents and shacks, lacking water and electricity, unable to receive medical treatment, and unable to find work, living in misery. This has driven them to repeatedly rise up and protest against the government.

	On August 12, thousands of protesters marched on the roads, holding up signs with slogans protesting the government. They shouted angrily, "We need jobs!" "We need homes!" "We don't want to be earthquake victims for life!"

	On August 8, thousands of earthquake victims in Sicily staged protests and marches on the roads from the provincial capital Palermo to Santa Margherita di Belice and on the national roads from the northern to the southern parts of the island. Large numbers of women, children, and elderly people participated in the struggle.

	The Italian government brazenly dispatched police to suppress the protesters. The protesters fought back against the reactionary police.

	Montevideo, August 13 (New China News Agency) – University students in the Uruguayan capital Montevideo staged another fierce protest march on August 12, denouncing the Uruguayan government's dispatch of police to illegally raid the Uruguayan National University on August 9.

	That day, students marched in large numbers on the main street of Montevideo, "18 de Julio." They distributed leaflets and angrily smashed the windows of the Ministry of Culture building. The Uruguayan government dispatched police to brutally suppress the protesting students, using tear gas, high-pressure water hoses, and batons. Reactionary mounted police wielded sabers, but the protesting students fearlessly fought back with stones, iron bars, and slingshots. Students set up barricades and barbed wire around the Uruguayan National University. They also engaged in a pursuit battle with the police on the streets of Montevideo. The fierce struggle between students and police began in the morning and continued until the evening.

    新华社十三日讯　罗马消息：意大利西西里岛的地震灾民，最近一再举行声势浩大的示威，愤怒谴责意大利当局对他们困苦的处境采取置若罔闻的恶劣态度。数千名灾民十二日举行的示威，使西西里区从阿尔卡莫到卡斯特尔维特拉诺的公路交通整日陷于瘫痪状态。
    意大利在地中海的大岛西西里，今年一月发生了强烈的地震，使得二百五十多人死亡，大批房屋倒塌，劳动人民无家可归。半年多以来，意大利当局对于地震灾区劳动人民困苦的处境不闻不问。目前，成千上万的劳动人民仍然被迫居住在帐篷和茅屋里，他们缺水、缺电，有病无法医治，也找不到工作，生活在水深火热之中。这促使他们一再奋起斗争，向政府表示强烈的抗议。
    十二日，数千名示威者在公路上高举着标语牌，上面写着向政府表示抗议的口号。他们还愤怒地高呼：“我们需要工作！”“我们需要房子！”“我们不愿一生一世当地震灾民！”
    八日，数千名地震灾民在西西里区首府巴勒莫到圣玛格的塔迪贝利切的公路上，和从西西里岛北部到南部的国家公路上举行示威游行。大批妇女、儿童和老人参加了这次斗争。
    意大利当局竟悍然出动警察对示威群众进行镇压。示威群众同反动警察进行了搏斗。
    新华社十三日讯　蒙得维的亚消息：乌拉圭首都蒙得维的亚大学生十二日再次举行激烈的示威游行，抗议乌拉圭当局九日派出警察闯进乌拉圭国立大学，非法搜查校园的暴行。
    这一天，大学生们在蒙得维的亚主要街道“七月十八日大街”上举行大规模的示威游行。他们散发传单，并愤怒地砸碎了文化部大楼的窗户。乌拉圭当局出动警察对示威学生进行野蛮镇压，他们使用了催泪瓦斯、高压水龙和警棍，反动的骑警挥舞着马刀，但是，示威学生不畏强暴，用石块、铁棍和弹弓进行英勇的还击。学生们在乌拉圭国立大学的周围筑起了路障，架起了铁丝网。他们还在蒙得维的亚的大街上同警察展开追击战。学生和警察的激烈搏斗从清晨开始，一直持续到晚上。
