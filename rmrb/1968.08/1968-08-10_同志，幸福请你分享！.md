	Comrade, Share the Happiness!
	Gong Xiangdong

	The Factory Scene Tonight is the Most Enchanting
	In the sultry summer night, the rain-washed Beijing Second Machine Tool Factory appears even fresher. The lights at the gate are particularly bright tonight. Workers, their bodies emitting the fragrance of machine oil, gather in groups of three or five, some staring intently at the end of the road, others whispering and discussing... Suddenly, the sound of a car approaches from afar, and the gate erupts with cheers that pierce the night sky: "They're here! They're here!" Before the cheers subside, a Liberation-brand truck pulls up at the gate and is immediately surrounded by a joyous crowd. Members of the Capital Workers and Peasants Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team and the factory revolutionary committee member, Little Gao, steps down from the car, holding in both hands the precious gift from Chairman Mao to the working class—a golden, gleaming mango. As soon as Little Gao steps down, he is surrounded by layers of workers. Someone's idea, a few strong young men lift Little Gao above the crowd, and Little Gao raises the golden, gleaming mango high above his head. Thus, hundreds of eyes follow Chairman Mao's precious gift.

	The excited crowd enthusiastically shouts: "Long live Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao lives forever!" The slogans echo endlessly.

	After the crowd calms down slightly, a celebration immediately begins, with a representative from the propaganda team introducing the scene when they received the gift from Chairman Mao: "At that time, Tsinghua Garden was like a boiling sea. Even the most beautiful words could not express our loyalty to the great leader! This golden mango, it is Chairman Mao's spiritual atomic bomb, it permeates the deep affection of the great leader! Chairman Mao loves the people, and the people love Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao is always heart-to-heart with the masses!

	"We are members of the working class, representatives sent by the entire factory to implement Chairman Mao's new strategic deployment to Tsinghua Garden. This greatest happiness should belong to the entire factory workers, to the workers, peasants, and soldiers of the nation. To deliver Chairman Mao's gift back to the factory as quickly as possible, we volunteered eagerly. The trees are flying, the wind is howling, and we urged the driver to step on the accelerator, step on the accelerator... At that moment, we had only one wish: to bring the greatest happiness of our lives to everyone at the fastest speed, to share our boundless faith, admiration, love, and loyalty to the reddest red sun in our hearts!"

	The meeting ended, the night deepened. The crowd still surrounded the mango. This is the gift Chairman Mao gave to us workers, who wouldn't want to look at it more, smell it more! Even taking a deep breath of tonight's air, the heart feels so refreshed!

	Carrying the Mango to Spread Good News
	Holding the golden, gleaming mango, looking at the excited crowd, a magnificent picture unfolds in Little Gao's mind. He seems to see the whirling of machine tools, he seems to hear the laughter of engines. He sees so many comrades-in-arms waiting for this great piece of news! He invites a few people, holding the mango, walks towards the dormitories, family quarters, nurseries, canteens, hospitals... everywhere spreading the good news of happiness.

	In the hospital, the old man at the gate hears the news and his heart blooms. Without carefully looking at the precious gift, he shouts, "Long live Chairman Mao forever!" and asks Little Gao to quickly tell the patients.

	The usually quiet wards are filled with laughter today. The nurses, who used to be afraid of too many visitors affecting the patients' health, sing loudly today. She tells everyone, "Look! Sing! Let us forever remember this happy moment!"

	Little Gao, holding the mango, walks past bed after bed, repeatedly saying, "This is the happiness Chairman Mao gave us, please share it." The responses are the most beautiful wishes: "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life!" By the bed of a still-sleeping patient, Little Gao softly but passionately says, "Chairman Mao sent the mango to us, this is the happiness Chairman Mao gave us, please share it." The patient, upon hearing "Chairman Mao," immediately opens his eyes, looks at the mango. Little Gao brings the mango to his face, the patient takes a deep breath, as if to inhale the fragrance of the mango into his lungs. He excitedly says, "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao is our confidant, Chairman Mao is heart-to-heart with us. Seeing the mango, it's as if I've seen Chairman Mao, my illness has improved by half, I will definitely rest and recuperate, fight against it, and return to the factory to fight with you all." As soon as the words fall, waves of applause, beautiful wishes. The entire corridor, ward is immersed in a sea of happiness.

	During the day, back in the revolutionary committee office, Little Gao meets colleagues from out of town who are in Beijing on business. Despite his fatigue from not sleeping all night, he shares his heartfelt joy with these colleagues: "This is the happiness Chairman Mao gave us, please share it." Out-of-town colleagues, upon seeing the mango, treat spreading this good news as the most important task. Some pick up the phone to make long-distance calls, some rush out to send telegrams, spreading this great news from Beijing to every corner of the country.

	In this exciting night, there is a tall and strong old worker. He wears a work uniform that smells of machine oil and holds a red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" book, shouting with the youth: "Long live Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao lives forever!"

	This old worker is the famous socialist old yellow cow and an active learner of Chairman Mao's works, Li Guishifu, known throughout the factory.

	At this most happy moment, so many memories surge in his heart. He cannot forget that in the old evil society, his whole family lived in miserable poverty, hungry and cold. It was Chairman Mao who dispelled the clouds and let all the poor brothers in China see the sun. From then on, he became the master of a socialist factory. For more than a decade, he has been studying Mao Zedong Thought with unparalleled class feelings, hungry and thirsty. For the revolution, he has endless strength, daring to fight against all actions that go against Mao Zedong Thought; for production, he has boundless energy, diligently and conscientiously, treating the factory as his own home. Tonight, when he hears the news that Chairman Mao sent the mango to the Capital Workers and Peasants Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, he rushes from his home to the factory. Seeing the golden, gleaming mango, thinking of the bitter past and the sweet present, he cannot contain his excitement, feeling immensely happy, and meaningfully tells his comrades, "This is Chairman Mao's heart, as if Chairman Mao has come to our factory, Chairman Mao is one of us. We must forever remember this day, never change our hearts for generations to come." Saying this, he pushes through the crowd, finds his wife and son, and calls them home.

	This is a very ordinary family. The walls are covered with Chairman Mao's portraits, the table is laid with the red "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," and the wall hangs the certificate of attending the first Beijing Municipality Xuanwu District and Factory Conference of Active Learners of Chairman Mao's Works. Here, every day is a classroom for studying Chairman Mao's works, every day echoes the wishes for Chairman Mao's eternal life. Tonight, Li Shifu once again tells the family the bitter history, leading the family to swear to Chairman Mao: "Chairman Mao, without you, there would be no Li Guishifu, without you, there would be no happiness for us. Our family swears to you, we will never forget our roots, forever follow you to make the revolution!" Then, the song "The party's favor is greater than the sky, parents are not as dear as Chairman Mao" echoes through the door, over the walls, resonating in the misty night sky...

　　同志，幸福请你分享！
　　工向东
    今夜厂景最迷人
    伏夏，夜雨冲洗过的北京第二机床厂显得更加清新。大门口，今夜的灯光格外明亮。浑身散发着机油芳香的工人，三个一伙，五个一群，有的用双眼盯住马路的尽头，有的在交头接耳地议论……。突然，远处传来汽车的声音，厂门口爆发出一阵冲破夜空的欢呼声：“来了！来了！”欢声未落，一辆解放牌汽车在厂门口刚一刹车，立刻便被欣喜若狂的人群包围得水泄不通。首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队成员、厂革委会委员小高同志，双手捧着毛主席赠送给咱们工人阶级的珍贵礼品——一个金光闪闪的大芒果走下车来。小高一下车就被工人们围了个里三层，外三层。也不知是谁的主意，几个棒小伙子把小高托到人海之上，小高又把那金光闪闪的大芒果高高地举过头顶。于是几百双眼睛跟着毛主席的珍贵礼品转动。
    激动的人群，热情欢呼：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万万岁！”口号声此起彼伏，接连不断。
    当人群稍稍平静之后，立即举行了一个庆祝会，由宣传队的代表介绍接到毛主席送来的礼物时的情形：“那时候，清华园里象一片沸腾的海洋，人们用最美好的语言，也表达不尽我们对伟大领袖的赤胆忠心！这个金色的芒果呵，是毛主席给我们的精神原子弹，它渗透着伟大领袖的多少深情！毛主席热爱人民，人民热爱毛主席。毛主席永远和人民群众心连心！
    “我们是工人阶级的一员，是全厂职工为了实现毛主席的新的战略部署派到清华园的代表，这最大最大的幸福应该属于全厂职工，属于全国的工农兵。为了把毛主席的礼物最快地护送回厂，我们争先恐后，纷纷报名。树在飞，风在啸，我们还催司机再加大油门，再加大油门……。这时，我们只有一个心愿：把这一生中最大的幸福以最快的速度带给大家，共同表达对我们心中最红最红的红太阳的无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限热爱、无限忠诚！”
    会已散，夜已深。芒果的周围还围满了人群。这是毛主席送给咱工人的礼物呵，谁不想多看一看，多闻一闻！即使是深深地呼吸一口今夜的空气呵，心眼里也好象舒畅十分！
    手捧芒果传佳音
    手里捧着金光闪闪的芒果，眼望着沸腾的人群，一幅最壮丽的图画在小高脑海里呈现。他仿佛看见机床的飞转，他仿佛听到马达的欢笑。他看到多少共同战斗的战友，等待着这个特大的喜讯！他约了几个人，手捧着芒果走向宿舍、家属区、托儿所、食堂、医院……到处传送着幸福的佳音。
    在医院里，看门的老人听到了这个消息，心里乐开了花。他顾不得仔细看看那颗珍贵的礼品，高呼一声：“祝毛主席万寿无疆！”就让小高把这个喜讯赶紧告诉病人。
    往日沉寂的病房，今日笑声如潮。往日护士害怕访问的人多，影响病人的健康，今日啊，她放开喉咙歌唱。对大家说：
  “看吧！唱吧！让我们永远记住这个幸福的时刻！”
    小高捧着芒果，走过一张张病床，不断地说着：
  “这是毛主席给我们的幸福，请你分享。”回答的都是最美好的祝愿：“敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！”在一个还在昏睡的病人床边，小高轻声而又充满激情地说：“毛主席把芒果送给了我们，这是毛主席给我们的幸福，请你分享。”病人一听到“毛主席”三个字就立刻睁开了眼睛，看看芒果。小高把芒果送到他的脸前，病人深深呼吸，好象要把芒果的芳香吸入肺腑。他激动地说：“毛主席，毛主席是我们的贴心人，毛主席和我们心连心。看了芒果，我就好象看到了毛主席，我的病好了一大半，我一定安心养病，与它作斗争，早日回厂和你们一起战斗。”话音刚落，一阵阵热烈的掌声，一声声美好的祝愿。整个楼道、病房沉浸在幸福的海洋里。
    白天，回到革委会办公室里，小高碰到从外地来北京出差的同志，他不顾一夜未睡的疲劳，把满心的喜悦告诉给这些同志：“这是毛主席给我们的幸福，请你们分享。”外地同志见到芒果，就把传送这个喜讯当成了最重要的任务。有的拿起电话机挂了长途，有的跑出去拍电报，将这一特大喜讯从北京传向祖国各地。
    老树红花向阳开
    在这个沸腾的晚上，有一个身材魁梧的老工人，他穿着一身散发着机油香的工作服，手捧着一本红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，和青年人一起纵情高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”
    这个老工人，就是全厂闻名的社会主义老黄牛、学习毛主席著作的积极分子李贵师傅。
    在这最最幸福的时刻，有多少往事涌上他的心头。他不能忘记，在那万恶的旧社会，他们全家过着饥不得食，寒不得衣的苦难生活。是毛主席他老人家拨散了云雾，让全中国的穷哥儿们见到了太阳。从此，他成了社会主义工厂的主人。十几年来如一日，他怀着无比深厚的阶级感情，如饥似渴地学习毛泽东思想。对革命他有用不尽的力量，敢于对一切违背毛泽东思想的行为作斗争；对生产他有使不完的劲头，勤勤恳恳，把工厂当成自己的家。今夜，当他听到毛主席把芒果送给首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队的喜讯的时候，他从家里赶到厂里。看着金光闪闪的芒果，想着苦去甜来的生活，他按捺不住激动的心情，感到无比的幸福，意味深长地对同志们说：“这是毛主席的心哪，好象毛主席来到我们厂，毛主席就是我们厂里人。我们要永远记住这个节日，子孙万代不变心。”说到这里，他挤出了人群，找到了老伴和儿子，把他们叫到了家里。
    这是一个很普通的家庭，屋子里贴满了毛主席像，桌上摆着红彤彤的《毛泽东选集》，墙上挂着出席北京市宣武区和厂首届学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会的奖状。这里，每天都是学习毛主席著作的课堂，每天都响着祝愿毛主席万寿无疆的声音。今晚，李师傅又一次对全家讲了苦难的家史，领着全家向毛主席宣誓：“毛主席啊，毛主席！没有您，就没有我李贵，没有您，就没有我们的幸福。我们全家向您表决心，我们世世代代不忘本，永远跟着您老人家干革命！”接着“天大地大不如党的恩情大，爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲”的歌声，穿过屋门，越过院墙，回响在细雨茫茫的夜空……
