	The Role of the Locomotive

	Editor Comrades:

	In a year of supporting the left, we have deeply felt that the working class is the leading class. They are the bravest in fighting the enemy, listen to Chairman Mao's words the most, align with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments the most tightly, and defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line the most resolutely!

	Early this year, a small handful of class enemies stirred up a wave of anarchism on the railways, attempting to disrupt the normal transportation order. At this critical moment, the broad masses of workers in the locomotive section spontaneously organized a "Revolutionary and Production Crew Combat Group." They said: We do not want bourgeois factionalism, we do not want cliques, we resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words, "Grasp revolution, promote production." No matter what the situation, we must not let the trains stop or be delayed in the Hengyang area, ensuring the smooth flow of the red artery.

	This combat group is the iron fist of the broad masses of workers spontaneously organized to strike down class enemies and anarchism. Wherever there is a shortage of drivers, they send people to fill in, wherever there is a shortage of firemen, they also send people to fill in, wherever difficulties arise, workers fight there. They have made tremendous contributions to implementing Chairman Mao's great policy of "Grasp revolution, promote production."

	The workers of the locomotive section are fighting with high spirits, and the vehicle section is catching up quickly.

	One night, when a train arrived at Hengyang East Station, one of the carriages malfunctioned, threatening to affect the entire train's operation. The news reached the vehicle section's repair team. According to the old system, cars could not be repaired at night, and if they were not moved into the station line, they could not be repaired. What to do! The train must not stop. Under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the workers of the repair team immediately took their tools to the work site for emergency repairs. After more than two hours of struggle, they ensured the train departed on time.

	Since then, wherever a train malfunctioned, the workers of the repair team would proactively carry their tools and hammers to the work line to fix it, ensuring the train departed on time.

### 火车头的作用

专栏：革命群众来信

    火车头的作用编辑同志：
    在一年的支左实践中，我们深深体会到：工人阶级是领导阶级。他们对敌斗争最勇敢，最听毛主席的话，跟毛主席伟大战略部署最紧，捍卫毛主席革命路线最坚决！
    今年初，一小撮阶级敌人在铁路上刮起了一股无政府主义妖风，企图搅乱铁路的正常运输秩序。就在这个关键时刻，机务段里广大工人自动组织起一个“抓革命促生产乘务战斗组”。他们说：我们不要资产阶级派性、不要山头，坚决听毛主席的话，“抓革命，促生产”。无论什么情况下，决不能使列车在衡阳地区停车或晚点，保证红色大动脉畅通无阻。
    这个战斗组是广大工人群众自觉组织起来打击阶级敌人和无政府主义的铁拳头。哪辆车缺司机他们就派人顶，哪辆车缺司炉他们也派人去顶，什么地方出现了困难，工人们就战斗在什么地方。他们为落实毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针，做出了巨大的贡献。
    机务段工人斗志昂扬，车辆段也急起直追。
    一天夜里，一趟列车到衡阳东站时，其中有一辆车厢出了故障，将要影响整个列车的运行。消息传到了车辆段站修组，要是按照旧制度办事，夜里是不能修车的，不调进站线来更不能修。怎么办！决不让列车停摆。在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，站修组的工人们立即带上工具到作业场抢修，经过两个多钟头的奋战，保证了列车按点开出。
    从那以后，哪里的列车出了故障，站修组的工人就主动扛上工具风镐，跑到作业线去修，保证了列车按点开出。
