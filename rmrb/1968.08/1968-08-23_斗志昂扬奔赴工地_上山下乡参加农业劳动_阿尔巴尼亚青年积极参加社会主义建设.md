Young People Full of Fighting Spirit Rush to Construction Sites and Go to the Countryside to Participate in Agricultural Labor

Albanian Youth Actively Participate in Socialist Construction

Xinhua News Agency, Tirana. According to the Albanian News Agency: In the great struggle to realize the fourth five-year plan and build a socialist motherland, Albanian youth have played a pioneering and exemplary role. Revolutionary youth have actively participated in major construction projects and taken on the responsibility of completing these projects.

A year and a half ago, Albanian male and female youth enthusiastically responded to the call of the Albanian Labor Party and began to engage in the construction of the 54-kilometer Logjcian-Fieri railway through voluntary labor. Now, the construction of this railway is entering the completion stage. So far, 47 kilometers of the railway embankment have been completed, 43 kilometers of tracks have been laid, 160 engineering projects have been completed, and the remaining 15 engineering projects are in the process of completion.

The road construction project from Mallesia to Mase is also entering the completion stage.

In recent days, the youth have rotated on these two major projects. 11,000 male and female youth voluntary laborers have successfully completed their tasks and returned, while another 8,000 youth voluntary laborers have arrived at the construction sites. In recent days, the construction sites have been adorned with red flags, and the youth voluntary laborers leaving and rushing to the construction sites have sung loudly. The youth are full of vigor and fighting spirit, and they are determined to redouble their efforts to complete these two major projects by the end of October.

In addition to these projects, the youth have also carried forward the spirit of fearlessness and selfless labor, going to the mountains and countryside to participate in agricultural labor, especially in land reclamation and the construction of terraces in hilly areas. Recently, more than 300 youth voluntary laborers have arrived in the Yonufri area of Fier to join the battle.

Albanian youth widely participate in the development and construction of their motherland, fully demonstrating the excellent style of loving the motherland and closely connecting with the masses of the young generation.

Albanian youth students are very active in the revolutionary movement. They go to the countryside and factories to participate in industrial and agricultural production labor, combining theory with practice, and achieving remarkable results.

    阿尔巴尼亚青年积极参加社会主义建设
    新华社地拉那电　据阿尔巴尼亚通讯社报道：阿尔巴尼亚青年在实现第四个五年计划，建设社会主义祖国的伟大斗争中，发挥了先锋模范作用。广大革命青年积极投入建设的大工程，承担起完成这些工程的责任。
    一年半以前，阿尔巴尼亚的男女青年热烈响应阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的号召，以义务劳动的方式，开始从事修建五十四公里长的洛格齐恩—费里铁路。现在，修建这条铁路的工程已进入完成阶段。到目前为止，这条铁路的四十七公里路基已经完成，已经铺设了四十三公里的铁轨，建成了一百六十个工程项目，其他十五个工程项目正在完成中。
    马列西亚到马塞的公路工程也已进入完成阶段。
    这几天来，青年们在这两个大工程上进行了换班。一万一千名男女青年义务劳动者胜利完成任务回去了，又有八千名青年义务劳动者到达工地。连日来，工地上红旗招展，离开工地和奔赴工地的青年义务劳动者歌声嘹亮。青年们意气风发，斗志昂扬，他们决心加倍努力，要在十月底完成这两项大工程。
    除了这些工程以外，青年们还发扬不怕艰难和忘我劳动的精神，上山下乡参加农业劳动，特别是开垦土地和在山丘地区建立梯田。最近又有三百多名青年义务劳动者到达发罗拉区的约努弗里，投入战斗。
    阿尔巴尼亚青年广泛参加祖国的开发建设事业，这充分显示了青年一代热爱祖国，紧密联系群众的优良作风。
