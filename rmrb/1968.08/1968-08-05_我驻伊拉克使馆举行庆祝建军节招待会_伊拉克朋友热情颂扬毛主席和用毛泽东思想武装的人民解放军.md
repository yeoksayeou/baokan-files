The Chinese Embassy in Baghdad held a reception to celebrate the 41st anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

Iraqi President Ahmed Hassan Bakr sent a floral basket to congratulate the Chinese on their Army Day.

About 300 guests attended the reception hosted by the Chargé d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Iraq, Wei Jianye. Among them were Labor and Social Affairs Minister Anwar Abdul Kadir Hadisi, Health Minister Izat Mustafa, Industrial Minister Khalid Makki Hashimi, and Petroleum and Mining Minister Rashid Rifa'i.

Diplomats and military attachés from various countries in Baghdad also attended the reception.

At the warm and friendly reception, many Iraqi friends and friends from other countries enthusiastically praised Chairman Mao, the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, which was created and armed with Mao Zedong Thought by Chairman Mao.

An Iraqi friend said: "Chairman Mao is a great leader. Mao Zedong Thought is the beacon illuminating the path to victory for all peoples of the world. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army have won national liberation and are achieving great victories in all aspects of the Chinese socialist revolution and socialist construction. As long as the Arab people follow Chairman Mao's words and fight against U.S. imperialism and the Israeli aggressors, they will definitely liberate Palestine and other occupied Arab lands from the occupation of U.S. imperialism and its lackey, Israel."

An African freedom fighter in Baghdad told a Xinhua News Agency reporter that they, the freedom fighters, deeply love Chairman Mao and diligently study Chairman Mao's works, especially his military works. He said: Following Chairman Mao's teachings, relying on the people, organizing the people, and waging a resolute struggle against U.S.-led imperialism, we African freedom fighters will definitely achieve victory by following the path indicated by Chairman Mao.

    伊拉克艾哈迈德·哈桑·贝克尔总统给招待会送了花篮，祝贺中国建军节。
    大约三百位来宾出席了我驻伊拉克大使馆临时代办韦建业举行的招待会，他们中有劳工和社会事务部长安瓦尔·阿卜杜勒·卡德尔·哈迪西，卫生部长伊扎特·穆斯塔法，工业部长哈立德·马基·哈希米以及石油和矿业部长拉希德·里法伊。

    在洋溢着热烈友好气氛的招待会上，许多伊拉克朋友和其他国家的朋友热情颂扬毛主席，颂扬战无不胜的毛泽东思想和毛主席亲自缔造的、用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民解放军。
    一位伊拉克朋友说：“毛主席是伟大的领袖。毛泽东思想是照亮全世界人民胜利道路的灯塔。在毛泽东思想照耀下，中国人民和人民解放军赢得了民族解放，正在中国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的各方面取得伟大的胜利。只要阿拉伯人民听毛主席的话，跟美帝国主义和以色列侵略者进行斗争，他们一定能从美帝国主义及其走狗以色列的占领下解放巴勒斯坦和其他被占领的阿拉伯土地。”
