The people of all countries, who make up more than ninety percent of the world's population, are always going to make revolution. They will always support Marxism-Leninism. They will not support revisionism; some may temporarily support it, but they will ultimately abandon it. They will gradually awaken and will oppose imperialism and the reactionaries in their own countries. They will also oppose revisionism.
