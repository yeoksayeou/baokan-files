"Smash the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty'!" "Overthrow the Sato Government!"

Masses in Tokyo and Yokohama continue anti-U.S. struggle
Workers, students, and activists of the Japan-China friendship movement hold demonstrations and marches, demanding the dismantling of U.S. military bases and opposing the transport of U.S. military supplies

	NEW DELHI, Aug. 2 (Xinhua) - According to a report from the Oriental News Agency, Japanese youth workers, students, and activists of the Japan-China friendship movement held demonstrations and marches in several places in Tokyo and Yokohama on July 31 and August 1, opposing the transport of jet fuel for U.S. military aircraft and demanding the dismantling of U.S. military bases.

	On the evening of July 31, Japanese youth workers and students engaged in a courageous struggle near the U.S. military base in Tachikawa to prevent the transport of jet fuel for U.S. military aircraft. They sat on the railway tracks, forcing the train carrying jet fuel for U.S. military aircraft to Tachikawa Base to stop. On the same evening, about 100 young workers in the Tama area held a protest rally and sit-in in front of the railway station, opposing the transport of jet fuel for U.S. military aircraft.

	On the evening of August 1, about 300 patriotic workers and members of the Tokyo headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) held a rally demanding the dismantling of the U.S. military helicopter base located in the Azabu district of central Tokyo. They held demonstrations and marches in front of the helicopter base and on the streets. The demonstrators carried red flags with the slogan "Long Live Mao Zedong Thought" and many banners. The banners read "Rebellion is justified," "Oppose the policy of hostility towards China," "Overthrow the Sato Government," "Smash the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty,'" and other slogans.

	On the evening of July 31, 130 young workers and students, despite the ban by the police authorities, held a rally in front of the square at Shinjuku Station in Tokyo, where the train carrying jet fuel for U.S. military aircraft passed. More than 1,000 citizens joined their struggle.

	In Yokohama, on the evening of August 1, about 250 students held a demonstration on the railway tracks at the national railway's Yashio Station and engaged in a sit-in in front of the train carrying jet fuel for U.S. military aircraft that was about to depart from this station. The demonstrators shouted slogans: "Do not transport jet fuel for U.S. military aircraft!" "Smash the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty'!"

	The police authorities dispatched more than 500 police officers to suppress the demonstrators and arbitrarily arrested 69 students.

	On the same evening, about 200 young workers held a demonstration in front of the U.S. military hospital in Kishi, Yokohama, demanding the dismantling of this hospital that serves the U.S. aggression in Vietnam. The young workers surrounded the hospital, shouting slogans such as "Dismantle the U.S. military hospital," "Oppose the Vietnam War," and "Smash the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty'."

	In the midst of the surging anti-U.S. tide in the Japanese archipelago, the revolutionary people of Japan remember the great teacher Chairman Mao's teaching of "Rebellion is justified against reactionaries," and raise the banner of revolutionary rebellion, creating a great uproar against the U.S.-Japan reactionaries and the revisionist group led by Kyuichi Tokuda of the Japan Communist Party.
