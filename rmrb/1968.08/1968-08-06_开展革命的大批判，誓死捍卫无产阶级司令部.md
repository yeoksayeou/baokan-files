The big-character poster by Chairman Mao titled "Bombard the Headquarters" is a brilliant document of Marxism-Leninism. It thoroughly exposes the cover of the two-line struggle within our party and issues a great call to arms to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters headed by the Chinese Khrushchev.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a decisive battle between the proletarian and bourgeois headquarters. History has entrusted the fundamental task of defending the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin to the death, thoroughly smashing the bourgeois headquarters headed by the Chinese Khrushchev, and completely overthrowing and exposing the handful of unrepentant capitalist-roaders within the party politically, ideologically, and theoretically, criticizing them deeply and thoroughly, and sweeping them into the dustbin of history.

We proletarian revolutionaries are infinitely loyal to the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao. We deeply understand that carrying out a thorough and sustained revolutionary great criticism is a great strategic measure to defend the proletarian headquarters and thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters. In the past, the Chinese Khrushchev personally came to the Fengfeng Coal Mine to spread the reactionary revisionist goods of "exploitation is meritorious," "class struggle is extinguished," "technology first," "bonus as the commander," and "material incentives." The handful of capitalist-roaders within the Mine Bureau have long followed the Chinese Khrushchev's reactionary plans to practice bourgeois dictatorship over the broad masses of workers, aiming to achieve their evil goal of restoring capitalism. In response to this situation, our Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team immediately went deep into the mines, organized workers to recall and compare, and exposed the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev's anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought activities. A revolutionary mass movement of great criticism quickly unfolded. At the same time, we followed Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forget class struggle" and mobilized the broad revolutionary masses to combine the great criticism with the cleansing of class ranks, exposing a handful of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist-roaders, and other counter-revolutionaries hidden within the revolutionary ranks, strengthening proletarian dictatorship, and purifying the revolutionary ranks.

Due to the widespread and thorough implementation of the great criticism, the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad revolutionary workers has been continuously raised, and a good situation has emerged in production, with the total coal production of the entire bureau exceeding the national production plan for the first half of the year by seven days ahead of schedule.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Class struggle has not ended. The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the class struggle between various political forces, the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological realm, will still be long-term, tortuous, and sometimes very intense." We deeply understand that the closer the revolution is to victory, the sharper and more complex the class struggle becomes. Although the bourgeois headquarters headed by the Chinese Khrushchev have been defeated by hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses, the class enemies are not reconciled to their failure and will continue to engage in sabotage and disruption in various ways. Therefore, we must remain sober-minded, carry out the great criticism more thoroughly and sustainably, closely unite with the masses, and accurately and resolutely strike at the handful of class enemies. We must firmly support and bravely defend the new revolutionary committees, remain forever loyal to the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and carry the political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes to the end!

    毛主席的《炮打司令部》的大字报，是马克思列宁主义的光辉文献，它彻底揭开了我们党内两条路线斗争的盖子，向全国人民发出了彻底摧毁以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部的伟大战斗号令。
    无产阶级文化大革命是无产阶级和资产阶级两个司令部的一场大决战。历史赋予我们无产阶级革命战士的根本任务，就是要誓死保卫以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，彻底摧毁以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，把党内一小撮死不改悔的走资派从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底斗倒斗臭，批深批透，扫进历史的垃圾堆。
    我们无产阶级革命战士，无限忠于以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部。我们深深懂得，深入持久地开展革命大批判，是保卫无产阶级司令部、彻底摧毁资产阶级司令部的伟大战略措施。过去，中国赫鲁晓夫曾亲自跑到峰峰煤矿来，大肆散布“剥削有功”论、“阶级斗争熄灭”论，大搞“技术第一”、“奖金挂帅”、“物质刺激”等反革命修正主义黑货。矿务局党内一小撮走资派，长期以来就是按照中国赫鲁晓夫一套反革命的方案，对广大工人实行资产阶级专政，以达到他们复辟资本主义的罪恶目的。针对这种情况，我们毛泽东思想宣传队立即深入到各矿区，组织工人回忆对比，大摆中国赫鲁晓夫反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的滔天罪行，一场革命大批判的革命群众运动迅速开展起来了。同时，我们又遵循毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，发动广大革命群众，把革命大批判同清理阶级队伍结合起来，揪出了隐藏在革命队伍内的一小撮叛徒、特务、死不改悔的走资派及其他反革命分子，加强了无产阶级专政，纯洁了革命队伍。
    由于广泛深入地开展了革命大批判，广大革命职工的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟不断提高，生产上出现了一片大好形势，全局原煤产量提前七天超额完成了上半年国家生产计划。
    毛主席教导我们：“阶级斗争并没有结束。无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争，各派政治力量之间的阶级斗争，无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的阶级斗争，还是长时期的，曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。”我们深深懂得，革命越是接近胜利，阶级斗争就越尖锐，越复杂。以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，虽然已被亿万革命群众打得落花流水了，但是阶级敌人是不甘心于他们的失败的，他们还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱。因此，我们一定要保持清醒的头脑，更加广泛深入持久地展开革命大批判，密切联系群众，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人，坚决支持、勇敢捍卫新生的革命委员会，永远忠于以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，把无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命进行到底！
