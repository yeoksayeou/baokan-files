	The Chinese Embassy in the Yemen Arab Republic issued a statement on July 31st in Sana'a, strongly condemning the serious anti-China crimes committed by the reactionary armed forces in Yemen, backed by U.S. imperialism, which brazenly shelled the residence of Chinese technical personnel working in Yemen and the textile factory built with Chinese aid. The full text of the statement is as follows:

	On July 25, 1968, the reactionary armed forces in Yemen, backed by U.S. imperialism, brazenly shelled the residence of Chinese technical personnel working in Yemen and the textile factory built with Chinese aid, injuring Chinese technical personnel and damaging the dormitories of the Chinese technical team, part of the factory equipment, and construction machinery. It must be pointed out that the reactionary armed forces in Yemen had already shelled the residence of Chinese technical personnel on May 5 this year.

	The Chinese Embassy strongly condemns this serious anti-China crime by U.S. imperialism and the reactionary forces in Yemen, which violates international norms. The Chinese and Yemeni peoples have forged a deep friendship in their long struggle against imperialism and colonialism. U.S. imperialism's attempt to sow discord and sabotage Sino-Yemeni friendship through its shameless atrocities is doomed to failure and will only backfire.

	The Chinese Embassy reaffirms: The Chinese people and government, starting from the interests of the peoples of China and Yemen, firmly support the just struggle of the Yemeni people and government to safeguard national independence and oppose U.S. imperialist aggression.

    新华社萨那三十一日电　中华人民共和国驻阿拉伯也门共和国大使馆三十一日在这里发表声明，强烈谴责在美帝国主义支持下的也门反动武装力量悍然炮击在也门工作的中国技术人员的驻地和中国援助也门建设的纺织厂的严重反华罪行。声明全文如下：
    一九六八年七月二十五日，在美帝国主义支持下的也门反动武装力量，悍然炮击在也门进行援助建设工作的中国技术人员的驻地和中国援助也门建设的纺织厂，炸伤中国技术人员，炸坏了中国技术工作组的宿舍和部分工厂设备以及施工机械。必须指出，也门反动武装早在今年五月五日就曾炮击中国技术工作人员的驻地。
    中国大使馆强烈谴责美帝国主义和也门反动势力这一破坏国际关系准则的严重反华罪行。中国人民和也门人民在长期反帝反殖斗争中结成了深厚的友谊。美帝国主义妄图通过制造无耻的暴行来挑拨和破坏中也友谊，这是徒劳的，只能搬起石头砸自己的脚。
    中国大使馆重申：中国人民和中国政府从中、也两国人民的利益出发，坚决支持也门人民和也门政府为维护民族独立、反对美帝国主义的侵略而进行的正义斗争。
