The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must learn to look at problems comprehensively, seeing not only the positive aspects but also the negative aspects." Under the enthusiastic assistance of the People's Liberation Army, the Revolutionary Committee of Huzhu Tu Autonomous County in Qinghai Province has striven to study and apply Chairman Mao's brilliant philosophical thought of "one divides into two." By applying this viewpoint to class struggle, production struggle, and other areas, they have reduced blindness and increased self-awareness, taking the initiative in all work. This has powerfully smashed the class enemy's evil plots to disrupt the revolution and production, greatly promoted the thought revolution of the leading cadre, and further consolidated and developed the great achievements of the Cultural Revolution.

Joy in Victory Should Not Make Us Forget the Enemy

"Whoever sees only the bright side and not the difficulties will not be able to fight well for the realization of the Party's tasks." Chairman Mao's great teaching has made the members of the Revolutionary Committee of Huzhu Tu Autonomous County always maintain a clear mind and be highly vigilant against the class enemy. They frequently conduct in-depth investigations and research, timely grasp the new trends, characteristics, and problems of class struggle, and take the initiative in class struggle.

In mid-November of last year, shortly after the establishment of the county Revolutionary Committee, some leading members began to feel complacent and relaxed. Some thought that after more than a year of life-and-death struggle, the Revolutionary Committee had been established, and it was time to relax. Others said that the county's revolutionary three-in-one combination was formed in battle and had a solid foundation, so there was no need to fear the class enemy's attempts to sow discord. In response to these situations, the county Revolutionary Committee and the supporting People's Liberation Army immediately organized a study class for all members of the Revolutionary Committee. They sharply raised the question, "Where is the Revolutionary Committee heading?"

In the study class, everyone studied Chairman Mao's series of teachings on the issue of power and his report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Through the study, all members of the Revolutionary Committee realized that the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee was "only the first step of the long march," and the road ahead was longer, the work was greater, and more arduous. Any sense of complacency or relaxation was wrong. In the study, the members of the Revolutionary Committee reviewed the history of the two classes and two-line struggles since the Cultural Revolution, clearly recognizing that the class enemy had not given up and was not asleep. They hid in dark corners, always watching for opportunities to strike. This sounded the alarm for the members of the Revolutionary Committee: "In times of victory, never forget class struggle." Then, everyone analyzed the new characteristics of class struggle since the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, namely, the class enemy's attempts to separate and destroy the new Revolutionary Committee and the masses' connections. They either spread a rightist reversal wind, attempting to confuse the class lines and shift the direction of struggle, or they fired sugar-coated bullets, attempting to deceive or corrupt our comrades, causing some members of the Revolutionary Committee to lose contact with the masses. Some members of the lower-level Revolutionary Committees, due to their lack of vigilance against the class enemy, were even lured away by the class enemy's sweet talk, money, and women. This made everyone further realize that the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee did not mean the end of class struggle and two-line struggle, but rather that in the new situation, this struggle became more hidden, sharper, and more complex. Therefore, the answer of all members of the Revolutionary Committee to the question of where the Revolutionary Committee is heading is: only by following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and firmly grasping class struggle! If we do not grasp class struggle, there is a danger that our power will be lost and regained.

The study class organized by the Revolutionary Committee of Huzhu Tu Autonomous County was a class for studying and applying Chairman Mao's brilliant philosophical thought of "one divides into two," a class for examining willpower and enemy situation. It greatly armed the thoughts of the members of the Revolutionary Committee and enhanced their willpower. After the study class, the members of the Revolutionary Committee immediately went deep into the grassroots and among the masses, and together with the masses, they launched a deep and sustained revolutionary criticism. They exposed the class enemy's crimes of firing sugar-coated bullets and destroying the Revolutionary Committee, criticized the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" by the Chinese Khrushchev, and opposed right opportunism, right splitism, and right capitulationism. They smashed the rightist reversal wind, making the class enemy's plots to destroy the Revolutionary Committee unsuccessful, and continuously consolidated the new Revolutionary Committee in the storms of class struggle. The comrades of the Revolutionary Committee of Huzhu Tu Autonomous County deeply felt: "Chairman Mao's brilliant philosophical thought of 'one divides into two' is the fundamental for us to hold power and use power well, and it is a powerful ideological weapon for us to defeat the class enemy."

In Praise, Do Not Forget Ideological Remolding

Chairman Mao teaches us that all things in the world can be divided into two. After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, how the three representatives correctly treat themselves in the spirit of "one divides into two," learning from others' strengths and making up for one's own weaknesses, is a major issue related to whether the Revolutionary Committee can achieve ideological unity and unity and consolidation. In this regard, the comrades of the Revolutionary Committee of Huzhu Tu Autonomous County have set an example.

Nearly half of the members of the Revolutionary Committee of Huzhu Tu Autonomous County are representatives of the revolutionary masses. They are all "August 18th soldiers" who have been tested in the Cultural Revolution. In the Cultural Revolution, they displayed the revolutionary spirit of daring to think, dare to do, and dare to break through, and rose up to rebel against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, making great contributions to the Cultural Revolution. After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, these "small people" who were originally not famous suddenly became leaders of the masses, and their status changed greatly. The leadership praised them, the masses supported them, and even the class enemy came out to flatter them. At this time, two paths were placed before them: one was to be satisfied with the status quo, thinking that they had contributed to the revolution and lying down to sleep on their "merits," gradually becoming detached from the masses; the other was to continue to display the revolutionary spirit of daring to think and dare to break through, set high standards for themselves, and continuously revolutionize and advance. Most of the mass representatives of this county's Revolutionary Committee correctly chose the latter path. In the midst of praise, they remembered Chairman Mao's teaching: "Even if our work has achieved extremely great results, there is no reason to be proud and arrogant. Humility makes one progress, and arrogance makes one fall behind. We should always remember this truth." Everyone strictly demanded of themselves. The deputy director of the Revolutionary Committee and the director of the county August 18th Federation, Comrade Zhang Huai Gong, worked in the industrial and commercial system, which followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment relatively well and often received praise from the county Revolutionary Committee. The masses were also satisfied. Comrade Zhang Huai Gong and other comrades of the August 18th Federation, on the one hand, took the praise as a spur to themselves, and on the other hand, also regarded it as a "danger signal." Every time they were praised by their superiors, they would consciously find their own gaps and do their work better. These mass representatives paid little attention to their past merits. They knew that merits could only represent one's past, not one's present and future. They always saw more of their own weaknesses, such as being young, having little fighting experience, and having a low policy level. They often learned from old revolutionary cadres and the People's Liberation Army. In their work, they never thought they were right, always respected the military representatives and revolutionary cadres, consulted before taking action, reported after taking action, and always used Chairman Mao's five criteria for successors to examine and demand of themselves. Although they were members of the Revolutionary Committee, they still lived and worked with the masses. They said: the position has changed, but the style of connecting with the masses cannot change; the status has changed, but the ordinary laborer's character cannot change; the work has changed, but the feelings with the proletariat and the working people cannot change.

Most of the revolutionary leading cadres of this county were sent to work in this county after the Four Cleanups movement. During the Cultural Revolution, they united and fought with the revolutionary masses. After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, they had relatively high prestige among the Revolutionary Committee and the masses. They did not become arrogant because of this. They remembered Chairman Mao's teaching, "Do not rely on past merits, but establish new merits," and strictly demanded of themselves, finding gaps and weaknesses. They felt that their revolutionary spirit was not as strong as that of the mass representatives, and politically, they were not as sensitive as the mass representatives. They held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasized proletarian politics, and grasped the "four firsts," but they were not as good as the People's Liberation Army. Therefore, they could put down their pride, humbly learn from the mass representatives and the People's Liberation Army. The director of the Revolutionary Committee, Comrade Liu Zhenhai, was recognized by everyone as a "good commander." In the various work of the Revolutionary Committee, he could actively come up with ideas and solutions, especially daring to cultivate new cadres. Many things were consciously let new cadres do. If new cadres made mistakes, he did not blame them too much but took the responsibility himself. In daily work and life, he always paid attention to setting an example, not enjoying special privileges in life, and maintaining the good style of hard work and plain living. After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, he was the first to carry his bedroll and go to the countryside to study, labor, and criticize and reform with the masses. In half a year, he visited all 22 communes in the county. The masses reflected: "In the past, cadres came down by car, and when they arrived at the commune, they sat in the house all day; now the director comes down to the countryside with his bedroll, laboring together on the mountain slopes, resting in the fields without stopping to sing the quotations." In this situation, Comrade Liu Zhenhai was not complacent but often convened meetings with the members of the Revolutionary Committee and poor and lower-middle peasants to actively solicit opinions on the work of the Revolutionary Committee and understand what the masses were thinking and how Chairman Mao's instructions were being implemented. Under his leadership, the Revolutionary Committee often launched the activity of "sending a valuable opinion" to voluntarily place the Revolutionary Committee under the supervision of the masses.

The supporting People's Liberation Army members, in the Cultural Revolution, held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly supported the broad leftist masses, firmly supported and defended the new-born Revolutionary Committee, and brought Mao Zedong Thought into the Revolutionary Committee. They thought what the masses thought and helped what the masses needed, playing the role of work teams, combat teams, and propaganda teams, and making new contributions to the Cultural Revolution. After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, they respected the leadership of the Revolutionary Committee and firmly implemented the resolutions of the Revolutionary Committee. They always humbly thought that they were not familiar with local work and needed to learn from revolutionary leading cadres and mass representatives. In Huzhu Tu Autonomous County, a true fish-water relationship was formed between the military and the people, and between the military and the government.

In this way, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the three representatives of the Revolutionary Committee of Huzhu Tu Autonomous County formed a revolutionary, united, and fighting command post, making the Revolutionary Committee always follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, unite in thought and action, and lead all ethnic groups in the county to achieve an overall victory in the Cultural Revolution.

At present, under the leadership of the Revolutionary Committee of Huzhu Tu Autonomous County, the situation of revolution and production in the whole county is excellent. The mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is unprecedentedly high, the revolutionary criticism is vigorous, and the momentum of learning from Dazhai is enthusiastic. Ninety-seven percent of the grassroots cadres and ninety percent of the department-level cadres have stood out. Nearly seventy percent of the production teams have implemented the Dazhai management system. The production tasks in the industrial front for the first half of the year were also completed relatively well. The prices in the financial and commercial front are stable, and the market supply is sufficient. All primary and secondary schools in the county have fully implemented the policy of "class suspended, revolution first."

    活学活用毛主席光辉哲学思想
    牢牢地掌握各项工作的主动权
    青海省互助土族自治县革委会应用一分为二的观点指导自己的实践取得很大成绩
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“我们必须学会全面地看问题，不但要看到事物的正面，也要看到它的反面。”青海省互助土族自治县革命委员会，在支左解放军的热情帮助下，努力活学活用毛主席一分为二的光辉哲学思想，把一分为二的观点，应用到阶级斗争、生产斗争等方面，减少了盲目性，提高了自觉性，取得了各项工作的主动权，有力地粉碎了阶级敌人破坏革命和生产的罪恶阴谋，大大促进了领导班子的思想革命化，进一步巩固和发展了无产阶级文化大革命的伟大成果。
    欢呼胜利时不要忘记还有敌人
    “谁要是只看见光明一面，不看见困难一面，谁就会不能很好地为实现党的任务而斗争。”毛主席的这一伟大教导，使互助土族自治县革命委员会的领导成员，随时保持清醒的头脑，随时保持对阶级敌人的高度警惕，经常进行深入的调查研究，及时掌握阶级斗争的新动向、新特点、新问题，在阶级斗争中打主动仗。
    去年十一月中旬，县革命委员会成立不久，在个别领导成员中产生了骄傲自满情绪和松劲麻痹思想。有的认为，经过一年多的生死搏斗，革命委员会成立了，可该松口气了！有的说，我们县的革命三结合，是在战斗中形成的，基础是牢固的，不怕阶级敌人挑拨离间。针对这些情况，县革命委员会和支左解放军立即组织了革命委员会全体成员的学习班，尖锐地提出了“革命委员会向何处去？”的问题。在学习班里，大家学习了毛主席关于政权问题的一系列教导，学习了毛主席《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》。通过学习，革命委员会的全体成员认识到，革命委员会的成立，“只是万里长征走完了第一步”，以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦，任何骄傲自满情绪、麻痹松劲思想都是错误的。在学习中，革命委员会的成员回顾了无产阶级文化大革命以来的两个阶级和两条路线斗争的历史，清楚地认识到，阶级敌人并没有死心，并没有睡觉，他们躲在阴暗的角落里，随时窥测方向，寻找时机，以求一逞。这给革命委员会的成员敲起了警钟：在胜利的时候，“千万不要忘记阶级斗争。”接着，大家分析了革命委员会成立以来阶级斗争的新特点，即阶级敌人千方百计地企图离间和破坏新生的革命委员会和群众的联系。他们或者大刮右倾翻案黑风，妄图扰乱阶级阵线，转移斗争大方向；或者施放糖衣炮弹，妄图欺骗或腐蚀我们的同志，使革命委员会某些成员脱离群众。个别基层革命委员会的成员，由于丧失了对阶级敌人的警惕，甚至被阶级敌人用甜言蜜语、金钱美女拉了过去。这使大家进一步认识到：革命委员会的成立，并不意味着阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的结束，而是在新形势下，这种斗争更加隐蔽、更加尖锐、更加复杂了。因此，革命委员会的全体成员对革命委员会向何处去的回答是：只有紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，狠抓阶级斗争！如果不抓阶级斗争，我们的政权就有得而复失的危险。
    互助土族自治县革命委员会举办的这一期学习班，是活学活用毛主席一分为二哲学思想的学习班，是查斗志、查敌情的学习班，大大武装了革命委员会成员的思想，提高了斗志。学习班结束以后，革命委员会的成员，立即深入基层，深入群众，和群众一起开展了深入持久的革命大批判，大揭阶级敌人施放糖衣炮弹、破坏革命委员会的罪行，大批中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论，大反右倾机会主义、右倾分裂主义、右倾投降主义，粉碎了右倾翻案妖风，使阶级敌人企图破坏革命委员会的各种阴谋未能得逞，使新生的革命委员会在阶级斗争的风浪中不断地巩固起来。互助土族自治县革命委员会的同志深有所感地说：“毛主席一分为二的光辉哲学思想，是我们掌好权、用好权的根本，是我们战胜阶级敌人的强大思想武器。”
  在赞扬声中不要忘记思想改造
    毛主席教导我们说，世界上的一切事物，都是可以一分为二的。革命委员会成立以后，三方面代表如何一分为二地正确对待自己，取人之长，补己之短，这是关系到革命委员会能否从思想上实行一元化的领导、从思想上团结和巩固的重大问题。在这方面，互助土族自治县革命委员会的同志作出了榜样。
    互助土族自治县革命委员会的成员，将近一半是革命群众代表，他们都是经过文化大革命斗争考验的八·一八战士。在文化大革命中，他们发扬敢想、敢干、敢闯的革命精神，起来造了党内一小撮走资派的反，造了资产阶级反动路线的反，为无产阶级文化大革命作出了巨大的贡献。革命委员会成立以后，这批本来不出名的“小人物”，一跃而成为群众的领导，他们的地位发生了很大的变化。领导上赞扬他们，群众拥护他们，甚至阶级敌人也出来捧场。这时，在他们面前摆着两条路：一条是满足现状，自以为对革命有功，躺在“功劳”上睡大觉，以致渐渐脱离群众；一条是继续发扬敢想敢闯的革命精神，高标准要求自己，不断革命，不断前进。这个县的革命委员会的群众代表，绝大多数都正确地选择了后一条路。在一片赞扬声中，他们牢记毛主席的教导：“即使我们的工作得到了极其伟大的成绩，也没有任何值得骄傲自大的理由。虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后，我们应当永远记住这个真理。”大家都严格要求自己。革命委员会副主任、县八·一八联委主任张怀功同志所在的工交系统，在紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署方面做得比较好，经常受到县革命委员会的表扬，群众也很满意。张怀功同志和八·一八联委的其他同志，一方面把表扬当作对自己的鞭策，一方面又把它看作“危险的信号”。每当上级表扬一次，他们就自觉地找一次差距，把各项工作做得好上加好。这些革命群众代表，很少去注意自己过去的功劳，他们懂得，功劳只能代表自己的过去，不能代表自己的现在和将来。他们总是较多地看到自己年纪轻，斗争经验少，政策水平差的弱点，经常注意向革命老干部学习，向解放军学习。在工作中，从不自以为是，处处尊重军队代表和革命干部，事前商量，事后汇报，事事用毛主席关于接班人的五条标准对照和要求自己。他们虽然是革委会成员，但仍然和群众生活、工作在一起。他们表示：职务变了，联系群众的作风不能变；地位变了，普通劳动者的本色不能变；工作变了，与无产阶级、劳动人民的感情不能变。
    这个县的革命领导干部，大部分是四清运动以后调到这个县来工作的，无产阶级文化大革命运动中，他们和无产阶级革命派团结在一起，战斗在一起。革命委员会成立以后，他们在革命委员会和广大群众中有较高的威信。他们没有因此飘飘然起来，他们牢记毛主席“不要吃老本，要立新功”的教导，严格要求自己，找差距，寻弱点，觉得自己的革命精神不如革命群众代表强，政治上不如革命群众代表敏感，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，狠抓“四个第一”等，则不如解放军，因而能放下架子，虚心向革命群众代表和解放军学习。革命委员会主任刘振海同志，是大家一致公认的“好班长”。在革命委员会的各项工作中，他能积极出主意，想办法，特别能大胆放手培养新干部，许多事情有意识地让新干部去干，新干部做错了，也不过多指责，首先自己主动承担责任。在日常的工作、生活中，他也处处注意以身作则，生活上不搞特殊化，保持艰苦朴素的优良作风。革命委员会成立后，他第一个背起行李卷，下乡和群众一起学习，一起劳动，一起斗私批修。半年来，跑遍了全县二十二个公社。群众反映说：“过去干部下来坐汽车，到社成天屋里坐；现在主任下乡背被窝，共同劳动在山坡，田头休息不停嘴，共同高唱语录歌。”刘振海同志在这种情况下并不自满，而是经常召集革命委员会成员和贫下中农座谈，主动征求对革命委员会工作的意见，了解群众在想些什么，毛主席指示执行得如何。在他的带动下，革命委员会经常发动群众开展“送一条宝贵意见”活动，把革命委员会自觉地置于群众的监督之下。
    解放军支左人员，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决支持左派广大群众，坚决支持和捍卫新生的革命委员会，把毛泽东思想带进了革委会。他们想群众之所想，帮群众之所需，发挥了工作队、战斗队、宣传队的作用，为无产阶级文化大革命立下了新的功劳。革命委员会成立以后，他们尊重革命委员会的领导，坚决贯彻革命委员会的决议，他们总是谦虚地认为，自己对地方工作不熟悉，要向革命领导干部和革命群众代表学习。在互助土族自治县，真正形成了军民、军政之间的鱼水关系。
    互助土族自治县革命委员会的三方代表，就这样在毛泽东思想的指引下，组成了一个革命的、团结的、战斗的指挥部，使革命委员会总是紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，统一思想，统一行动，率领全县各族人民去夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    目前，在互助土族自治县革命委员会的领导下，全县革命和生产一派大好形势。活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动空前高涨，革命大批判轰轰烈烈，学大寨的劲头热火朝天。全县有百分之九十七的基层干部和百分之九十的科部级干部站了出来。近百分之七十的生产队实行了大寨的经营管理制度。工业战线上半年生产任务完成得也比较好。财贸战线物价稳定，市场供应充足。全县中小学校全部实现了复课闹革命。
