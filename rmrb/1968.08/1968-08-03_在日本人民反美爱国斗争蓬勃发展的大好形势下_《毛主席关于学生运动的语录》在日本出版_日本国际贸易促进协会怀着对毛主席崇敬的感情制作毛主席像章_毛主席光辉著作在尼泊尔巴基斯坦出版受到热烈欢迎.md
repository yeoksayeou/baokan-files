In the midst of the flourishing patriotic anti-American struggle of the Japanese people, the great leader of the proletariat, Chairman Mao's brilliant quotations on student movements, have recently been compiled, translated, and published in Japanese by the East Bookstore in Japan. This is a great joy for the revolutionary youth and students in Japan who are fighting against the reactionary forces of the United States and Japan, the modern revisionism of the Soviet Union, and the revisionist group led by Komoto.

The cover page of "Chairman Mao's Quotations on Student Movements" features a photograph of the great leader Chairman Mao and the instructions of Vice Chairman Lin: "Read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions."

The preface of "Chairman Mao's Quotations on Student Movements" states: "Comrade Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Comrade Mao Zedong has brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, bringing it to a new stage. Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is advancing towards worldwide victory."
