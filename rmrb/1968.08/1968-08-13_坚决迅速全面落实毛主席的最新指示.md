Just as we and the people of the entire nation are joyously celebrating the second anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters" and the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China Concerning the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," just as we are celebrating the joyous day when Chairman Mao presented mangos to the workers and peasants Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams in the capital, our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin received us. What a great happiness! What a great honor! Tears of excitement welled up, and a red heart seemed ready to leap out. We shout a thousand times, sing ten thousand times, wishing Chairman Mao longevity! Longevity!

Beloved great leader Chairman Mao, you are the wise founder of our Party and our army. The proletarian headquarters led by you and Vice Chairman Lin is the sole leadership center for the entire Party, the entire army, the entire nation, and the broad revolutionary masses. This center concentrates the wisdom of humanity, creates the highest truth of the contemporary era, and represents the fundamental interests and revolutionary will of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses. By resolutely following the proletarian headquarters led by you and Vice Chairman Lin, we can defeat all enemies, overcome all difficulties, and achieve one victory after another. In the years of war, our Sixth Company resolutely executed your principles of political construction of the army, carried forward the spirit of "marching forward without fear," and made its due contributions in the battles to defend Yan'an, defend the Party Central Committee, and defend Chairman Mao, earning the honorable title of "Combat Exemplary Company."

In recent years, especially during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our Sixth Company, following the instructions of Vice Chairman Lin, has held high the great red banner of your thought, studied and applied your brilliant works, undergone the severe test of class struggle, and thoroughly smashed the reactionary bourgeois military line of China's Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionist element Luo Ruiqing, building itself into a company that is infinitely loyal to you and your revolutionary line.

Years of struggle have made us deeply understand a great truth: by following the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, our cause will definitely advance and definitely win. However, in the new situation of seizing the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a small handful of class enemies at their wits' end in society are using the reactionary "multi-center theory" to spread rumors and slander, stir up trouble, and interfere with Chairman Mao's strategic deployment, attempting to sabotage and shake the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, obstructing the implementation of the proletarian revolutionary line. We will not agree to this by a thousand times, by ten thousand times!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Communist Party of China is the leadership core of the entire Chinese people. Without such a core, the cause of socialism cannot be victorious." We are revolutionary fighters armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Defending the sole leadership position of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin is our sacred duty. We will resolutely fight against all plots to sabotage the leadership core of the revolutionary people of the entire nation! We must continuously raise our revolutionary organizational discipline, strengthen our revolutionary collective consciousness, under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, unify our will, unify our steps, and unify our actions. We will better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely, swiftly, and comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

　　坚决迅速全面落实毛主席的最新指示

    正当我们和全国人民一道热烈欢庆毛主席《炮打司令部》的大字报和《中国共产党中央委员会关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》发表两周年的时候，正当欢庆毛主席向首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队赠送芒果的大喜日子里，我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席接见了我们。这是多么大的幸福！多么大的光荣！激动的眼泪夺眶而出，一颗红心快要跳了出来。我们千遍欢呼，万遍歌唱，敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席啊，您是我党和我军的英明缔造者。以您为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，是全党、全军、全国和广大革命群众的唯一领导中心。这个中心集中了人类的智慧，创造了当代最高真理，代表了无产阶级和广大革命群众的根本利益和革命意志。坚决紧跟以您为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，我们就能够战胜一切敌人，克服一切困难，取得一个又一个的胜利。在战争年代里，我们六连坚决执行您的政治建军的原则，发扬了“一往无前的精神”，在保卫延安，保卫党中央，保卫毛主席的战斗中作出了自己应有的贡献，荣获“战斗模范连”的光荣称号。
    近几年来，特别在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们六连又根据林副主席指示，高举您的伟大思想红旗，活学活用您的光辉著作，经受了阶级斗争的严峻考验，彻底粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿的反动的资产阶级军事路线，把自己建设成一个无限忠于您和您的革命路线的连队。
    多少年的斗争实践使我们深刻认识到一个伟大的真理：紧跟以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，我们的事业就一定前进，一定胜利。可是，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的新形势下，社会上一小撮穷途末路的阶级敌人，利用反动的“多中心论”，造谣诬蔑，挑拨离间，干扰毛主席的战略部署，企图破坏和动摇以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，妨碍无产阶级革命路线的贯彻执行。我们一千个不答应，一万个不答应！
    毛主席教导我们说：“中国共产党是全中国人民的领导核心。没有这样一个核心，社会主义事业就不能胜利。”我们是毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士，捍卫以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部唯一的领导中心地位，是我们的神圣职责。我们坚决和一切企图破坏全中国革命人民的领导中心的阴谋作斗争！我们要不断提高革命的组织纪律性，加强革命的整体观念，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部领导下，统一意志，统一步伐，统一行动，更好地活学活用毛泽东思想，坚决、迅速、全面地落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
