The Revolutionary Committee of the Construction Engineering Bureau of Fuzhou District deeply mobilizes the masses and relies on the masses to combine the persistent and in-depth revolutionary criticism with the struggle, criticism, and reform in the unit. The broad revolutionary workers repeatedly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist enterprise management line of Liu Shaoqi, greatly promoting the thought revolution of the people and presenting a new situation.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, August 22 — The Revolutionary Committee of the Construction Engineering Bureau of Fuzhou District, Jiangxi Province, leads the broad revolutionary workers to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, combining the persistent and in-depth revolutionary criticism with the struggle, criticism, and reform in the unit, fighting, criticizing, and reforming simultaneously. This has enabled the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to occupy the construction engineering front, greatly promoting the thought revolution of the workers, gradually establishing many new systems, and making the revolution and production thrive.

After the Revolutionary Committee of the Construction Engineering Bureau of Fuzhou District was established in March this year, it followed Chairman Mao's teaching, "We are not only good at destroying an old world, but we will also be good at building a new world," leading the broad revolutionary workers to combine the revolutionary criticism with the struggle, criticism, and reform in the unit. At that time, some people did not have a clear understanding of the relationship between struggle, criticism, and reform, focusing on "criticism" while neglecting "reform," thinking that "reform" is a matter for later, and some advocated "criticizing" first and then "reforming" after the higher authorities had made a unified arrangement. In response to these active thoughts, the Revolutionary Committee actively organized broad revolutionary workers to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's relevant works and a series of latest instructions, correctly understanding the relationship between struggle, criticism, and reform. The study class also organized revolutionary workers to use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to thoroughly expose and criticize Liu Shaoqi and his agents in the unit who promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist enterprise management line. Through study and criticism, the workers greatly enhanced their class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness, deeply realizing that struggle, criticism, and reform are interrelated and interdependent. If one only struggles without criticizing, one cannot eliminate the poison of counter-revolutionary revisionism; if one only criticizes without reforming, one cannot consolidate the achievements of the revolutionary criticism and the Cultural Revolution. Seriously carrying out struggle, criticism, and reform is a major issue related to the comprehensive victory of the proletarian cultural revolution. After raising their awareness, all the revolutionary workers and revolutionary cadres in the engineering bureau closely combined the revolutionary criticism with the struggle, criticism, and reform in the unit, making the struggle, criticism, and reform in the unit thriving.

In leading the revolutionary masses to carry out the struggle, criticism, and reform in the unit, the Revolutionary Committee of the Construction Engineering Bureau of Fuzhou District particularly emphasized deeply exposing and criticizing the crimes of Liu Shaoqi in promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist enterprise management line, and reforming everything that does not adapt to the socialist economic base on the basis of deep criticism. The Revolutionary Committee believed that the fundamental purpose of carrying out struggle, criticism, and reform is to thoroughly smash the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of Liu Shaoqi, thoroughly establish Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and build a superstructure that shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought and adapts to the socialist economic base. This is a matter of great importance for a hundred years and ten thousand years. If the criticism of the old and rotten things is not deep enough, thorough reform cannot be carried out, and one may eat half-cooked food or even go back to the old ways. Only by exposing deeply and criticizing thoroughly can one reform thoroughly. The Revolutionary Committee, through organizing Mao Zedong Thought study classes, armed the workers with Chairman Mao's great teaching of "breaking first, and establishing is within it," fully mobilized and relied on the masses, and extensively used big-character posters, cartoons, criticism columns, and holding criticism meetings and struggle meetings, etc., to launch a high tide of revolutionary criticism. The broad revolutionary workers repeatedly criticized Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist enterprise management line and then promptly carried out reforms. For example, Liu Shaoqi and his agents in the engineering bureau had long used the revisionist "material incentive" to corrupt the workers. The workers, after studying Chairman Mao's teaching of "without correct political views, one is equal to having no soul," used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon and used a large number of facts of the harm they personally suffered to repeatedly criticize the crimes of Liu Shaoqi and his agents, listing their evil deeds and eliminating their poison. On the basis of enhancing class struggle consciousness, they abolished the old system of heavily promoting "material incentive" and established a new system that highlights proletarian politics and achieves the thought revolution of the people.

The Construction Engineering Bureau of Fuzhou District adopted the method of first easy and then difficult, step by step deepening in carrying out the struggle, criticism, and reform in the unit. For example, Liu Shaoqi and his agents had long been vigorously promoting "profit-first," "business-first," and other counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods in this unit, fiercely opposing the highlight of proletarian politics, causing long-term disharmony and lack of unity among different trades and workers. Revolutionary workers used Chairman Mao's great teaching of "political work is the lifeline of all economic work" to repeatedly criticize those counter-revolutionary black goods, thoroughly eliminating their poison, and establishing a new system of mutual care, support, and help among different trades. On the basis of criticizing and reforming relatively easy-to-reform old systems, the Revolutionary Committee led the broad revolutionary workers to deeply expose and criticize the relatively major and complex old systems in enterprise management and production, daring to carry out reforms. They also combined struggle, criticism, and reform with the completion of various production tasks. In production, when encountering old systems and old ideas that reflect the revisionist line, such as "crawling philosophy," "expert line," and "slavery," they immediately criticized and immediately reformed. In this way, the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad revolutionary workers continued to rise, and the revolutionary criticism was becoming better and better.

In carrying out the struggle, criticism, and reform in the unit, the members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Construction Engineering Bureau of Fuzhou District set an example for the workers. The broad workers praised, "The Revolutionary Committee has set an example for us, and we will definitely follow suit!"

The Construction Engineering Bureau of Fuzhou District combined the revolutionary criticism with the struggle, criticism, and reform in the unit, strongly promoting the revolution and production. The revolutionary tide surged forward, and production presented a new situation, with monthly over-fulfillment of the state plan. The total output value in the first half of this year increased by 156% compared to the same period last year. At the same time, the revolutionary workers of this bureau also completed 11 major technical innovation projects, some of which created a new page for the construction engineering of Jiangxi Province.

    抚州专区建筑工程处革委会深入发动群众依靠群众
    把革命大批判同本单位斗批改结合起来
    广大革命职工对中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义企业管理路线反复进行批判，大大促进了人的思想革命化，出现崭新局面
    据新华社南昌二十二日电　江西省抚州专区建筑工程处革委会带领广大革命职工，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，把持久深入的革命大批判同本单位的斗、批、改紧密结合起来，边斗边批边改，使战无不胜的毛泽东思想占领工程建筑阵地，极大地促进了职工思想革命化，逐步建立起许多崭新制度，革命和生产搞得轰轰烈烈。
    抚州专区建筑工程处革委会今年三月成立后，遵照毛主席“我们不但善于破坏一个旧世界，我们还将善于建设一个新世界”的教导，率领广大革命职工把革命大批判同本单位的斗、批、改结合起来。当时，有部分人对斗批改的关系认识不清，注意“批”，忽视“改”，认为“改”是以后的事，有的人主张先“批”，等上级有了统一部署再来“改”。针对这些活思想，革委会大办毛泽东思想学习班，积极带领广大革命职工反复学习毛主席的有关著作和一系列最新指示，正确认识斗、批、改的关系。学习班还组织革命职工以毛泽东思想为武器，狠揭狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其在本单位的代理人推行的反革命修正主义企业管理路线。通过学习和批判，职工们大大提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，深刻地认识到，斗、批、改是互相联系、互为因果的，如果只斗不批，不能肃清反革命修正主义的流毒，只批不改，不能巩固革命大批判和文化大革命的成果。认真搞好斗、批、改是关系到夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的重大问题。在提高认识后，全工程处的革命职工和革命干部紧密结合革命大批判，把本单位的斗、批、改搞得热火朝天。
    抚州专区建筑工程处革委会在领导革命群众进行本单位的斗、批、改中，特别强调对中国赫鲁晓夫推行反革命修正主义企业管理路线的罪行，揭深批深，在批深批透的基础上改革一切不适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑。革委会认为，搞斗，批、改的根本目的，就是要彻底摧毁中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，大立毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，建立起闪耀毛泽东思想光辉的适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑。这是百年大计，万年大计。对旧的腐朽的东西批判得不深，就不能进行彻底的改革，就会吃夹生饭，甚至走回头路。只有揭得深，批得透，才能改得彻底。革委会通过办毛泽东思想学习班，用毛主席的“破字当头，立也就在其中了”的伟大教导，武装职工群众，同时充分发动群众、依靠群众，广泛采用大字报、漫画、大批判专栏和召开批判会、斗争会等各种形式，掀起了革命大批判的高潮。广大革命职工对中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义企业管理路线，反复进行批判，然后抓紧改革。例如，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在工程处的代理人，多年来用修正主义的“物质刺激”腐蚀工人。职工群众学习了毛主席“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂”的教导，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，用自己亲身所受危害的大量事实，对中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的罪行反复进行批判，历数其罪恶，肃清其流毒。他们在提高阶级斗争觉悟基础上，废除了大搞“物质刺激”的旧制度，建立了突出无产阶级政治，实现人的思想革命化的崭新制度。
    抚州专区建筑工程处进行本单位的斗、批、改，采取了先易后难、步步深入的办法。例如，中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人过去在这个单位长期大肆推行“利润挂帅”、“业务第一”等反革命修正主义黑货，疯狂反对突出无产阶级政治，造成工种和工种、工人和工人间长期不协调、不团结。革命职工就用毛主席“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的伟大教导，反复批判了那些反革命黑货，彻底肃清其流毒，建立了工种间互相关心、互相支持、互相帮助的崭新制度。在对比较容易改革的旧制度进行批改的基础上，革委会又引导广大革命职工对企业管理和生产中比较重大的复杂的旧制度狠揭狠批，大胆进行改革。他们还把斗、批、改同完成各项生产任务结合起来，在生产中遇到那些反映修正主义路线的旧制度、旧思想，例如什么“爬行哲学”、“专家路线”、“奴隶主义”，就立即进行批判，立即进行改革。这样，广大革命职工的革命积极性不断高涨，革命大批判搞得越来越好。
    在进行本单位的斗、批、改中，抚州专区建筑工程处革委会成员以身作则，为职工群众树立榜样。广大职工群众称赞说：“革委会给我们做出了榜样，我们坚决跟着干！”
    抚州专区建筑工程处把革命大批判和本单位的斗、批、改紧密结合起来，强有力地推动了革命和生产。革命洪流滚滚向前，生产出现了崭新局面，月月超额完成了国家计划。今年上半年总产值比去年同期增长百分之一百五十六。在这同时，这个处的革命职工还完成了十一项重大的技术革新项目，其中有的革新为江西省的工程建筑开创了新的一页。
