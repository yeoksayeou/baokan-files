The entire nation's hundreds of millions of military and civilian personnel enthusiastically hail the second anniversary of Chairman Mao's great battle call: "You must care for state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" In the midst of the triumphant march to achieve a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and in the midst of the nation's joyous celebration of the second anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters" and the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China Concerning the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," as well as the second anniversary of the convening of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the hundreds of millions of military and civilian personnel across the nation, recalling the great victories achieved over the past two years under the inspiration of Chairman Mao's great battle call, have resolved to rally even more closely around the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, with Chairman Mao as the leader and Vice Chairman Lin as the deputy, to unify their will, steps, and actions, to thoroughly smash the reactionary bourgeois "theory of multiple centers," and to advance in victory under the orders of the proletarian headquarters in accordance with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment.

When the unprecedented flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution were just igniting, our great teacher and leader Chairman Mao, with the greatest genius and daring of a great proletarian revolutionary, foresaw the future and went among the masses to issue a great battle call of great historical significance. Under the inspiration of this great call by Chairman Mao, and under the guidance of Chairman Mao's series of wise decisions, hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses across the nation were fully mobilized. Even people in their sixties and seventies and children in their early teens cared about state affairs and actively participated in the movement, achieving a decisive victory in the first proletarian cultural revolution in human history. Today, in the great march to achieve a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao has presented the most precious gift to the capital's workers and peasants' propaganda teams for Mao Zedong Thought. People in various places excitedly say that the great leader Chairman Mao trusts the masses the most, relies on the masses the most, and is always heart to heart with the revolutionary masses. We will not disappoint Chairman Mao's great concern and sincere expectations. We must care more about state affairs, launch a new high tide of the revolutionary mass movement, and achieve new great victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Firmly follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and thoroughly smash the reactionary bourgeois "theory of multiple centers"

On the occasion of the second anniversary of Chairman Mao's great call, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers across the nation have resolutely declared that they must thoroughly criticize the reactionary bourgeois "theory of multiple centers," eliminate all interference, firmly follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and follow all the battle calls of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, advancing in victory.

The revolutionary workers of the Beijing No. 1 Rolling Mill, Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, Tianjin Sanjiaoshi Industrial District, Jilin Liaoyuan Mining Bureau, and the delegates of the Hohhot Workers' Congress have expressed the workers' class's boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao and the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao. They say, "We workers love Chairman Mao the most and listen to Chairman Mao's words the most. Under Chairman Mao's great call, over the past two years, we, together with the revolutionary people across the nation, have held high the revolutionary banner of 'It is reasonable to rebel against the reactionaries,' thoroughly smashed the bourgeois headquarters led by China's Khrushchev, and achieved a decisive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. At this crucial moment of achieving a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we workers must rally even more closely around the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, smash the reactionary 'theory of multiple centers,' resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and achieve a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

Jia Jincai, the chairman of the poor and lower-middle peasants' association of Dazhai Brigade in Xiangyang County, Shanxi Province, Yang Jianfa, deputy chairman of the Shenyang Revolutionary Committee and chairman of the Shenyang Farmers' Congress, Chen Xumeng, chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Dongfanghong Commune in Fengyang County, Anhui Province, and an old poor peasant, as well as the poor and lower-middle peasants of the Changgang area in Jiangxi Province, spoke for the hearts of the 500 million peasants across the nation. They said, "Under Chairman Mao's wise leadership, we poor and lower-middle peasants have united and overthrown the landlords and tyrants who rode on our heads, established mutual aid teams, advanced cooperatives, and people's communes, and embarked on the happy road of socialism. Long-term revolutionary struggle practice has made us deeply realize that firmly following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment is victory, and firmly following the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin is victory! Chairman Mao is our great savior, and the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin is our only leadership center. Whoever opposes the proletarian headquarters, we will resolutely fight to the death with them!"

The first-level combat hero of the People's Liberation Army Air Force, Zhang Jihui, the combat hero of a certain unit of the Navy Air Force, Shu Jicheng, the combat hero and former comrade-in-arms of Dong Cunrui, Zheng Shunyi, as well as the members of the "Support the Left and Love the People" model platoon and the unit where Men He was formerly stationed, said, "The great call issued by the great leader Chairman Mao two years ago is the highest mobilization order to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. The great victories achieved in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past two years are the result of the hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses resolutely responding to Chairman Mao's great call and resolutely executing all the battle calls of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao. We revolutionary soldiers have boundless love and loyalty for the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and we will resolutely carry out all its orders. Whoever opposes the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and persists in the reactionary 'theory of multiple centers,' we will resolutely overthrow them!"

The complete implementation of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions is the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The broad masses of military and civilian personnel across the nation have deeply felt from the two years of struggle practice that studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in earnest, especially studying and applying Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, turning Chairman Mao's great instructions into the conscious revolutionary actions of hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses, is the fundamental guarantee for achieving a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Knitting General Factory and Shanghai Valve Factory said, "Of all the important things, the most important is to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in earnest; of all the busy things, the most important is to grasp the fundamentals and not forget them. In the course of achieving a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we workers must take the lead in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in earnest, take the lead in carrying forward the revolutionary academic style of combining theory with practice advocated by Chairman Mao, implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions in our actions, and achieve new great victories according to the battle calls of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao.

Liu Yulan, a member of the Revolutionary Committee of Hebei Province and an active learner of Chairman Mao's works, said, "In our struggle practice, we have deeply felt that to firmly follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, we must carry forward the revolutionary academic style of combining theory with practice, study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in earnest, especially study and apply Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, study earnestly in the struggle, use them earnestly in the struggle, and implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions without the slightest deviation. The members of the unit where Liu Yingjun was formerly stationed in the Weihe Forestry Area of Heilongjiang Province said, "The practice of the past two years has made us realize that only by constantly arming ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought in class struggle and acting according to Chairman Mao's teachings, learning a little and using a little, can our people's army truly become a strong pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat. We are determined to firmly emphasize proletarian politics, insist on the Four Firsts, further do a good job in the Three Supports and Two Militaries, and together with the broad revolutionary masses, rally closely around the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and achieve a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

Inherit the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end

The revolutionary masses, the broad revolutionary masses, and the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army across the nation have reviewed Chairman Mao's great battle call issued two years ago, and their revolutionary spirit is more vigorous and their revolutionary will is more ardent. They have expressed that to carry the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, they must continue to carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat of "not being a hero until reaching the Great Wall," further strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, strengthen the struggle against the enemy, and carry out a sustained and in-depth revolutionary criticism, thoroughly eliminate the poisonous influence of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of China's Khrushchev.

The leaders of the Shenyang Workers' Congress and the Guiyang Railway Branch Revolutionary Committee have reviewed Chairman Mao's great call and recalled the course of the past two years of struggle. They said, "Chairman Mao's great call has given us boundless strength, inspiring us to achieve one victory after another. In the current new situation, we must remember Chairman Mao's great call even more, redouble our efforts, strive to be the best, and resolutely carry the revolution through to the end." The revolutionary workers of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau, with its glorious revolutionary tradition of "February 7th," have emphasized that they must further implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," and achieve new successes for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Longhua Brigade in Boluo County, Guangdong Province, have expressed that they will continue to carry out a sustained and in-depth revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticize and expose the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of China's Khrushchev, and let Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line take deep root in the hearts of the poor and lower-middle peasants. The sentinels guarding Tiananmen, the soldiers of the unit where Lei Feng was formerly stationed in Shenyang, the comrades of the People's Armed Department of Miji County, as well as the revolutionary masses and soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army in many places such as Nanjing, Hangzhou, Changsha, Xi'an, Lanzhou, and Nanchang, have all expressed that they must further raise their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, raise their revolutionary vigilance, resolutely smash all the tricks and schemes of a handful of class enemies who attempt to interfere with and sabotage Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and swear to carry the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, ensuring that our proletarian iron fortress remains red forever!
