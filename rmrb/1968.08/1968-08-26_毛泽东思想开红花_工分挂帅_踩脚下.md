The third brigade of the San Tangshan Production Brigade in Datangshan People's Commune has organized intensive study classes on Mao Zedong Thought, fiercely criticizing the "work points as the commander" fallacy of the Chinese Khrushchev, and promoting the spirit of public ownership among the proletariat. Last winter, the hay was not chopped completely. This spring, the commune members and cadres voluntarily used their time after work to chop three to four hundred thousand jin of hay without asking for work points. During the busy farming season, the commune members got up early to pull out the wheat and thresh it at noon. The brigade leader suggested recording more work points, but the commune members disagreed. Everyone said: "We have criticized 'work points as the commander,' so we must break with it completely and resolutely not engage in that practice." By emphasizing proletarian politics, everything else falls into place. Now, regardless of the work they do, the commune members are enthusiastic and proactive, without worrying about quotas or their own work points.

    毛泽东思想开红花
    “工分挂帅”踩脚下
    小汤山公社大汤山大队三队，大办毛泽东思想学习班，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫“工分挂帅”的谬论，无产阶级“公”字大发扬。头年冬季的饲草没铡完，今年春天，社员和干部们主动用收工后的时间，铡草三、四万斤，没有要记工分。“三夏”时节，社员起早拔麦子，晌午打麦子，队长提出要多记工分，社员们都不同意。大家说：“我们批判了‘工分挂帅’，就要和‘工分挂帅’一刀两断，坚决不搞那一套。”突出无产阶级政治，一通百通。现在，社员们不管干什么活，都积极主动，不问定额，不计较自己的工分。
