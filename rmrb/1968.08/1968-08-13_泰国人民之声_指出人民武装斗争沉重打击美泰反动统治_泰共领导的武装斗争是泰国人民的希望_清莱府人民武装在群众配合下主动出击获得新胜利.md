	"The Voice of the Thai People" radio station broadcasted an article on the 9th, pointing out that the U.S.-Thanom clique is making a desperate struggle, but they cannot escape their fate of failure.

	The article said, the Thai Communist Party leads the Thai people in revolutionary armed struggle. In the past three years, the brilliant victories achieved have greatly encouraged the Thai people, becoming the hope for the people to drive out U.S. imperialism and overthrow the Thanom-Babbo traitorous clique, and to struggle for national independence and people's democracy. The victories of the people's armed struggle have heavily struck the reactionary rule of the U.S.-Thanom clique. The article pointed out, the U.S.-Thanom clique is unwilling to accept failure, they will not voluntarily withdraw from the historical stage, they will continue to make trouble and struggle. As the great leader of the world revolutionary people, Chairman Mao Zedong pointed out: "Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until they are wiped out—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world in dealing with the people's cause. They will not violate this logic."

	The article further pointed out, recently, the U.S.-Thanom clique has intensified its savage suppression of the people's patriotic movement. Besides continuously sending troops to invade Thailand and directly suppressing the Thai people, U.S. imperialism has also provided the Thanom-Babbo clique with another 7.5 million U.S. dollars in "military aid," and provided a large amount of weapons to arm the Thai reactionary military and police.

	The article said, the Thai people's armed forces have repeatedly smashed the enemy's "encirclement and suppression," and rapidly developed and grown in the battles, becoming a force that no enemy can defeat. The U.S.-Thanom clique's attempt to extinguish the revolutionary flames of the Thai people is merely a fantasy. The patriotic struggle of the Thai people will continue to develop and grow.

	The article emphasized, the decisive factor in the victory or defeat of a war is not in weapons, but in people, in the broad masses with high political awareness. The revolutionary struggle of the Thai people is a just struggle, it is a people's war led by the Thai Communist Party under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. As long as the broad masses of the Thai people closely unite around the Thai Communist Party, grasp the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, they can defeat any enemy. The desperate struggle of the U.S.-Thanom clique can only accelerate their own doom.

	According to a broadcast by "The Voice of the Thai People" radio station on the 10th, the people's armed forces in Chiang Rai Province in northern Thailand, with the close cooperation of the people, have been continuously taking the initiative to strike the enemy and achieve new victories.

	The radio station said, according to incomplete statistics, from early July to August 4th, the people's armed forces in Chiang Rai Province attacked and ambushed enemy strongholds and engaged in battles with the enemy a total of sixteen times, annihilating a batch of the enemy's combat forces, damaging two enemy helicopters, and seizing a batch of weapons. The reactionary military and police of the Thanom-Babbo clique are very afraid of being attacked and ambushed by the people's armed forces, afraid of stepping on landmines and falling into traps, like startled birds, living in constant fear.

　　“泰国人民之声”指出人民武装斗争沉重打击美泰反动统治
　　泰共领导的武装斗争是泰国人民的希望
　　清莱府人民武装在群众配合下主动出击获得新胜利
    新华社十日讯　“泰国人民之声”电台九日广播的一篇文章指出，美国—他侬集团正在作疯狂挣扎，但是，它们绝不能摆脱失败的命运。
    文章说，泰国共产党领导泰国人民进行革命武装斗争，三年来所取得的辉煌胜利，极大地鼓舞了泰国人民，成为人民赶走美帝和推翻他侬卖国集团、争取民族独立和人民民主的希望。人民武装斗争的胜利，沉重地打击了美国—他侬集团的反动统治。文章指出，美国—他侬集团是不甘心失败的，它们决不会自动退出历史舞台，它们还要继续捣乱、挣扎。正如世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席所指出：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡—这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”
    文章接着指出，最近以来，美国—他侬集团加紧疯狂镇压人民爱国运动。美帝国主义除了陆续向泰国增派侵略军，直接镇压泰国人民外，还给他侬—巴博集团又提供七千五百万美元的“军事援助”，并且提供大量武器来武装泰国反动军警。
    文章说，泰国人民武装一次又一次地粉碎敌人的“围剿”，并且在战斗中迅速发展壮大，成为一支任何敌人都不能战胜的队伍。美国—他侬集团妄图扑灭泰国人民的革命烈火，这只不过是幻想。泰国人民的爱国斗争必将不断发展壮大。
    文章强调指出，战争胜负的决定因素不在于武器，而在于人，在于有高度政治觉悟的广大人民。泰国人民的革命斗争是正义的斗争，是在高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的泰国共产党领导下的人民战争。只要泰国广大人民紧密地团结在泰国共产党的周围，掌握战无不胜的毛泽东思想，就可以打败任何敌人。美国—他侬集团的疯狂挣扎，只能加速它们自己的灭亡。
    新华社十一日讯　据“泰国人民之声”电台十日广播：泰国北部清莱府人民武装，在人民群众的密切配合下，不断地主动打击敌人，获得新胜利。
    这家电台说，据不完全统计，从七月初到八月四日，清莱府人民武装袭击、伏击敌人据点以及同敌人战斗共十六次，歼灭了一批敌人的有生力量，打伤敌人直升飞机两架，缴获一批武器。他侬—巴博集团的反动军警，在人民武装的打击下，十分害怕遭到袭击和伏击，害怕触及地雷和掉进陷阱，犹如惊弓之鸟，惶惶不可终日。
