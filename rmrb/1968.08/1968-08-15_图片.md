The broad masses of soldiers and officers of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army are deeply carrying out revolutionary big character posters, severely criticizing the reactionary bourgeois "multi-center theory." Everyone unanimously expressed that they will resolutely and unconditionally implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, thoroughly criticize the reactionary bourgeois "multi-center theory," and forever remain loyal to the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. They will consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat and seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is the soldiers and officers combining the actual class struggle with Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a weapon, thoroughly criticizing the reactionary bourgeois "multi-center theory."
