Comrades, friends, and guests:

In the midst of the triumphant songs of our billion people and military in seizing the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Ministry of National Defense of our country is holding a banquet to enthusiastically celebrate the 41st anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army!

The glorious history of our army over the past 41 years is a history of the great victory of the great leader of our party, Chairman Mao, on the people's war and the people's army. It is a history of the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. It is a history of the great victory of Chairman Mao leading the billion people and military to seize power and consolidate power. We warmly celebrate the great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! We warmly celebrate the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line! We warmly celebrate the unprecedented consolidation and strengthening of our proletarian dictatorship! We warmly celebrate the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country!

The Chinese People's Liberation Army is a new-type revolutionary army nurtured and grown under the personal leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao and the direct command of Vice Chairman Lin Biao, and guided by the great Mao Zedong Thought. Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our army is completely for the liberation of the people, and it works thoroughly for the interests of the people." Over the past 41 years, under the wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, our army, together with the people of the whole country, has overthrown the three big mountains oppressing the Chinese people, defeated the domestic and foreign class enemies, and made immortal contributions to seizing power, establishing proletarian dictatorship, and defending and building our great socialist motherland. In the struggle against American imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and the Indian reactionaries, it has made tremendous contributions.

At present, the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country is excellent. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the scale and extent of the people's movement have surpassed any historical mass movement. The great and invincible Mao Zedong Thought has been widely popularized as never before, and the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought is surging across the country and the army. Under the great call of Chairman Mao to "bombard the headquarters," the broad revolutionary masses have been denouncing and attacking, relentlessly pursuing and striking, thoroughly smashing the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev, and exposing a handful of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist-roaders, and untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counterrevolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. At present, the revolutionary criticism is being carried out vigorously across the country, striking at a handful of class enemies accurately and forcefully. Revolutionary great alliances and revolutionary three-in-one combinations are expanding and consolidating. Revolutionary committees, which have been born in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have been generally established in most parts of the country. The work of reforming education, literature and art, state organs, and all superstructures that do not conform to the socialist economic base is being carried out in depth and has already achieved fruitful results. The struggle, criticism, and transformation in various units are also being carried out in depth. Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" is achieving brilliant victories, and the whole country is full of a thriving revolutionary scene.

In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our great leader Chairman Mao has issued the great call for the People's Liberation Army to be a great school and the battle order to support the broad leftist masses. He has entrusted our army with the glorious tasks of "three supports and two militaries." Vice Chairman Lin Biao has issued the great directive to "hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." This is the greatest concern and trust for our army, giving our army the greatest education and the best tempering. Under the command of our great leader Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, the Central Committee, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, the broad officers and soldiers of our army have fought bravely alongside the broad masses of workers, peasants, Red Guards, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals. They have courageously defended and resolutely executed Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, thoroughly criticized the capitalist reactionary line and military line advocated by the likes of China's Khrushchev, and settled their accounts. In the fierce class struggle, the class consciousness and line struggle consciousness of the broad officers and soldiers of our army have been raised to an unprecedented level. They are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, which has become the solemn oath and conscious action of all personnel in the army. This army of workers and peasants, unparalleled in the world, has never been as powerful as it is today. The relationship between the military and the people, and between the military and the government, has never been as close as it is today. Our national defense has never been as consolidated as it is today.

"The ship of the great ocean relies on the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." Our army has what it has today, the people have what they have today, and the country has what it has today, mainly because of Mao Zedong Thought. All our victories have been achieved under the leadership of Chairman Mao. Glory belongs to our great leader Chairman Mao, and glory belongs to the great Chinese people. Recently, Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao, and the leading comrades of the Central Committee and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, have received the representatives of the broad officers and soldiers of our army several times. This is the greatest glory for our army, the greatest concern, and the greatest encouragement. It has extremely profound significance for the revolutionary construction of our army. The Chinese People's Liberation Army will forever be loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, and we will defend Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin Biao, the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the death.

At present, the international situation is excellent. Our great leader Chairman Mao points out: "We are now in a new and great era of world revolution." Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought is spreading widely around the world, the awareness of the revolutionary people of various countries has been raised to an unprecedented level, and the national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are flourishing. Revolutionary storms are rising in Europe and North America. The political and economic crises of imperialism led by the United States are deepening rapidly, and modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist clique is disintegrating. The days of the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists are getting worse and worse. They are stepping up their counterrevolutionary global collusion. They have concocted the so-called "Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons" and attempt to push the already bankrupt policy of nuclear monopoly and nuclear blackmail. On the Vietnam issue, the U.S. imperialists, with the cooperation of the Soviet revisionists, are staging a peace talk farce, attempting to grab in negotiations what they cannot get on the battlefield. Recently, the Soviet revisionist clique has also signed consular agreements, air navigation agreements, and cultural agreements with the U.S. imperialists. The counterrevolutionary great betrayal of the Soviet revisionists has developed from the military to culture, from the ground to the sky. The traitorous face of the Soviet revisionists has been thoroughly exposed to the people of the world. The banditry of U.S. imperialism has aroused increasingly strong resistance from the people of the world. The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, firmly support the Vietnamese people in fighting to the end and achieving the final victory in the anti-U.S. national salvation war; firmly support the national democratic revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America; firmly support the anti-violence revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Europe and North America; and firmly support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries in the world. At present, the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and Indian reactionaries are stepping up efforts to form a counterrevolutionary encirclement aimed at the People's Republic of China, frequently violating our territorial waters and airspace, and creating border tensions. Their foolish and arrogant behavior is like striking a stone with an egg, seeking self-destruction. We solemnly warn the U.S. imperialists and their accomplices: if you dare to impose war on us, the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will definitely break your backs and completely, thoroughly, and cleanly annihilate your invading armies!

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "All our soldiers must always remember that we are the great People's Liberation Army, the army led by the great Communist Party of China. As long as we always follow the Party's instructions, we will definitely be victorious." At this crucial moment of seizing the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, all officers and soldiers of our army must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, further do well in the "three supports and two militaries" work, do well in the "support the government and love the people" work, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end with the broad revolutionary masses to achieve new merits for the people. We must further implement Vice Chairman Lin Biao's set of policies and principles on emphasizing proletarian politics, with Mao Zedong Thought as the banner, to carry out the ideological transformation of people, and build our army into a highly proletarianized and combat-ready people's army, and turn our army into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought. We must heighten vigilance, strengthen preparedness, and be ready at any time to smash the provocations and incursions of the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries, and be ready at any time to liberate the territory of our motherland—Taiwan!

Finally, on behalf of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Ministry of National Defense of our country, I would like to thank all comrades, friends, and guests for your attendance.

I propose a toast:

To the glorious victories achieved by the Chinese People's Liberation Army over the past 41 years,

To the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country,

To the great victories of the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries in the world,

To the friendship between the revolutionary peoples and revolutionary armies of various countries,

To the health of all the envoys, military attachés, comrades, friends, and guests present,

To the long life of the creator of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, our great leader Chairman Mao,

Cheers!

　　中国人民解放军永远忠于伟大领袖毛主席
　　决心把文化大革命进行到底为人民立新功
　　黄永胜总参谋长在庆祝中国人民解放军建军四十一周年招待会上的讲话
　　同志们，朋友们，来宾们：
    在我国亿万军民夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，我国国防部举行招待会，热烈庆祝中国人民解放军建军四十一周年！
    我军四十一年来的光辉历史，是我们党的伟大领袖毛主席关于人民战争和人民军队的伟大思想的胜利的历史，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的胜利史，是伟大统帅毛主席领导亿万军民夺取政权、巩固政权的胜利史。我们热烈欢呼战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！热烈欢呼毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利！热烈欢呼我国无产阶级专政的空前巩固和空前强大！热烈欢呼我国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利！
    中国人民解放军是我们的伟大统帅毛主席亲手缔造、亲自领导，林彪副主席直接指挥的，由伟大的毛泽东思想哺育成长起来的一支新型的革命军队。我们的伟大统帅毛主席教导我们：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”四十一年来，我军在伟大统帅毛主席的英明领导下，和全国人民一道，推翻了压在中国人民头上的三座大山，战胜了国内外的阶级敌人，为夺取政权，建立无产阶级专政，保卫和建设伟大的社会主义祖国，立下了不朽的功勋；在反对美帝国主义、苏联修正主义和印度反动派的斗争中，做出了巨大贡献。
    目前，我国无产阶级文化大革命形势一片大好。在毛主席无产阶级革命路线的指引下，人民群众发动的规模和程度，超过了历史上的任何群众运动。伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想空前大普及，活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动在全国、全军更加波澜壮阔。在毛主席“炮打司令部”的伟大召唤下，广大革命群众口诛笔伐，穷追猛打，彻底摧毁了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，揪出了一小撮叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派，以及没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子。目前，革命的大批判正在全国持续猛烈地开展，稳、准、狠地打击着一小撮阶级敌人。革命的大联合和革命的三结合越来越扩大、越巩固，在无产阶级文化大革命中新生的革命委员会，在全国绝大多数地区已经普遍地建立起来。改革教育，改革文艺，改革国家机构，改革一切不适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑的工作，正在深入地开展，并且已经取得了丰硕的成果。各单位的斗批改，也在深入地进行。毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，正在取得辉煌胜利，全国到处是一派蓬蓬勃勃的革命景象。
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们的伟大统帅毛主席发出了“人民解放军应该是一个大学校”的伟大号召，和“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的战斗号令，赋予我军“三支”“两军”的光荣任务，林彪副主席发出了“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功”的伟大指示，这是对我军最大的关怀和最大的信任，使我军受到了最大的教育和最好的锻炼。我军广大指战员在伟大统帅毛主席和林彪副主席、中央、中央文革的指挥下，与广大工人、农民群众、红卫兵小将、革命干部、革命知识分子一道，英勇战斗，奋不顾身，勇敢捍卫、坚决执行了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，彻底批判了中国赫鲁晓夫之流推行的资产阶级反动路线和资产阶级军事路线，清算了他们的罪行。在火热的阶级斗争中，我军广大指战员阶级觉悟和路线斗争觉悟空前提高，无限忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线，已成为全军人员的崇高誓言和自觉行动。我们这支举世无双的工农子弟兵，从来没有象今天这样的强大，军民之间、军政之间从来没有象今天这样的亲密无间，我们的国防从来没有象今天这样的巩固。
      “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”我们军队有今天，人民有今天，国家有今天，主要靠毛泽东思想。我们的一切胜利，都是在毛主席领导下取得的。光荣属于我们伟大领袖毛主席，光荣属于伟大的中国人民。最近，毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席、中央、中央文革的领导同志多次接见了我军广大指战员的代表，这是我军最大的光荣，这是对我军最大的关怀，最大的鼓舞，对我军革命化建设，具有极为深远的意义。我们中国人民解放军永远忠于伟大领袖毛主席，誓死保卫毛主席，保卫林副主席，保卫以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的党中央，保卫中央文革，保卫无产阶级文化大革命。
    目前，国际形势好得很。我们的伟大领袖毛主席指出：“我们现在正处于世界革命的一个新的伟大的时代。”马克思主义、列宁主义、毛泽东思想在全世界广泛传播，各国革命人民的觉悟空前提高，亚、非、拉民族解放运动正在蓬勃发展，欧洲、北美兴起了革命的大风暴。以美国为首的帝国主义的政治危机和经济危机急剧加深，以苏修叛徒集团为中心的现代修正主义日益分崩离析。美帝和苏修的日子越来越不好过，他们正在加紧进行反革命的全球大勾结。他们炮制了所谓“防止核扩散条约”，妄图推行早已破产的核垄断、核讹诈政策。在越南问题上，美帝在苏修的配合下，大搞和谈骗局，妄图在谈判桌上捞取在战场上得不到的东西。最近，苏修叛徒集团又和美帝签定了领事条约、通航协定和文化协定，苏修的反革命大叛卖，已经从军事发展到文化，从地面发展到天空。苏修的叛徒嘴脸，已经在全世界人民面前彻底暴露。美帝国主义的强盗行径，激起了全世界人民越来越强烈的反抗。用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民和中国人民解放军，坚决支持越南人民打到底，彻底取得抗美救国战争的最后胜利；坚决支持亚、非、拉人民的民族民主革命斗争；坚决支持欧洲、北美人民的抗暴革命斗争；坚决支持世界各国人民的革命斗争。当前，美帝、苏修和印度等反动派，正在加紧拼凑旨在反对中华人民共和国的反革命包围圈，频繁地侵犯我国领海、领空，制造边境紧张局势。他们这种愚蠢的狂妄行为，是以卵击石，自取灭亡。我们严正警告美帝国主义及其帮凶：如果你们胆敢把战争强加在我们头上，经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的中国人民和中国人民解放军，就一定打断你们的脊梁骨！把你们的侵略军坚决、彻底、干净、全部地消灭掉！
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“我全军将士必须时刻牢记，我们是伟大的人民解放军，是伟大的中国共产党领导的队伍。只要我们时刻遵守党的指示，我们就一定胜利。”在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的关键时刻，我全军指战员必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛泽东思想，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，进一步做好“三支”“两军”工作，做好“拥政爱民”工作，与广大革命群众一道，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，为人民立新功。必须进一步落实林副主席关于突出无产阶级政治的一整套方针、原则，用毛泽东思想挂帅，搞好人的思想革命化，把我军建设成为非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的人民军队，把我军办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。必须提高警惕，加强战备，随时准备粉碎帝、修、反的一切挑衅和窜犯，随时准备解放祖国的领土——台湾！
    最后，我代表中国人民解放军和我国国防部感谢各位同志，各位朋友，各位来宾的光临。
    我提议：
    为中国人民解放军四十一年来取得的辉煌胜利，
    为我国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，
    为世界各国人民革命斗争的伟大胜利，
    为各国革命人民和革命军队之间的友谊，
    为在座的各位使节，各位武官，各位同志，各位朋友和各位来宾的健康，
    为中国人民解放军的缔造者，我们的伟大统帅毛主席万寿无疆，
    干杯！
