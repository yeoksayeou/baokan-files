On the evening of August 5th at nine o'clock, workers from the Beijing Wool Textile Factory, who were stationed at Tsinghua University to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, had been working tirelessly all day to propagate Chairman Mao's latest directives. At this moment, they were about to rest. Suddenly, the radio broadcast a thrilling piece of news: our great leader Chairman Mao had sent mangos to the workers and peasants Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed at Tsinghua University! This news immediately caused the entire Tsinghua University to be in an uproar. The workers from the Beijing Wool Textile Factory, each and every one, were overjoyed and rushed out of their rooms, gathering together spontaneously, shouting in unison: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Wish Chairman Mao eternal life!" Their hearts were too excited to calm down. Someone suggested, "Chairman Mao truly cares about us workers. He has sent us the most precious gift—mangos. What should we use to welcome them?" This remark reminded everyone. The skilled female workers quickly proposed, "Let's make eight big red flowers and place the eight mangos inside the red flowers to bring them back. How about that?" Everyone heard this and happily said, "This is a good idea, this is a good idea." They decided to do it immediately. More than ten of the most skilled female workers took on this most glorious task. As they worked, they sang "Chairman Mao is with us" and "The Party's love is greater than the heavens and the earth." The more they made, the happier they felt, and the more they sang, the sweeter their hearts became.

In less than twenty minutes, the eight big red flowers were made. A worker happily said:

"Comrades, Chairman Mao has sent us the most precious gift. This is not only the greatest care and encouragement for our workers and peasants propaganda team, but also the greatest care and encouragement for the 700 million people of the entire country. I think we should add seven green leaves around each big red flower to represent the 700 million people, whose red hearts will forever be with Chairman Mao." Thus, each red flower was adorned with seven green leaves.

The eight red flowers were thus made. The moment of happiness arrived. The propaganda team members lined up in an orderly queue to go to the command center to receive the precious gift sent by Chairman Mao. They selected eight female workers, each holding a big red flower, to walk at the front of the queue.

The awarding ceremony began at eleven o'clock in the evening. When the eight female workers, holding eight bright red flowers with eight golden mangos, entered the venue, the entire venue immediately became a boiling ocean. Everyone looked at the golden mangos as if they saw Chairman Mao nodding and smiling affectionately; they touched the precious gift as if they were holding Chairman Mao's hand that steers the wheel of history. Cheers! Songs! Eyes fixed on the golden mangos, tears streaming down their cheeks. They blessed Chairman Mao a thousand times and ten thousand times, wishing him eternal life! Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Ten thousand words and a million songs cannot express our workers' boundless love for you, nor can they sing out our workers' boundless loyalty to you.

It was deep into the night, and the workers were too excited to sleep. Some leaned over the lamp to write in their diaries, recording this most happy and unforgettable moment; some leaned against the bed to write letters, hoping to quickly convey this great news to comrades and family; some stood by the table, writing pledges with a pen...

The workers said: "Chairman Mao did not send us mangos, but the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the mighty spiritual atomic bomb." They all expressed their determination to unite around the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and to fight to the end for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

　　八朵红花表忠心
　　黄元华
    八月五日晚上九时，住在清华大学宣传毛泽东思想的北京毛纺织厂的工人同志们，为了宣传好毛主席的最新指示，挥汗如雨地忙碌了一整天。此刻，他们正准备休息了。忽然，广播里播送了一个振奋人心的特大喜讯：我们伟大领袖毛主席给住在清华的首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队赠送了芒果！这一特大喜讯立刻使整个清华园沸腾了。北京毛纺织厂的工人同志，个个都兴高采烈地从房子里奔出来，不约而同地聚在一块，一遍又一遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“祝毛主席万寿无疆！”激动的心情无法平静。不知是哪位同志提出：“毛主席真关心咱们工人呀，他老人家把最珍贵的礼物——芒果送给咱们，咱们该拿什么去迎接呀？”这话提醒了大家。心灵手巧的女工们抢先提出她们的建议：“咱们就做八朵大红花，把八只芒果放在红花里捧回来。怎么样？”大家一听，都高兴地说：“这办法好，这办法好。”说干就干，十几位最善于做花的姑娘主动承担了这一最光荣的任务。大家一边做，一边高唱《毛主席和我们在一起》，《天大地大不如党的恩情大》。她们越做，心里越欢喜，越唱，心里越甜蜜。
    不到二十分钟，八朵大红花就做好了。一位工人同志高兴地说：
      “同志们，毛主席给咱们送来最珍贵的礼物，这不但是对咱们工农宣传队的最大关怀，最大鼓舞，而且是对全国七亿人民的最大关怀，最大鼓舞。我看，咱们再在每朵大红花周围添上七片绿叶，代表七亿人民，七亿人民红心永远向着毛主席。”于是每朵红花又添上了七片绿叶。
    八朵大红花，就这样做成了。幸福的时刻到来了。宣传队的同志排起整齐的队伍到指挥部去接回毛主席赠送的珍贵礼品。他们推选了八位女工同志，每人捧着一朵大红花，走在队伍的最前面。
    晚上十一时授礼大会开始了。当八位女工用八朵鲜艳的大红花托着八个金光闪闪的芒果走进会场时，会场里立刻成了沸腾的海洋。大家看一看那金色的芒果好象看到毛主席在亲切地点头微笑；摸一摸那珍贵的礼品，好象是握了握毛主席掌握历史舵轮的巨手。欢呼啊！歌唱啊！眼睛望着金色的芒果，腮边挂着泪珠。千遍万遍地祝福毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！毛主席啊，毛主席！千言万语，说不尽咱们工人对您的无限热爱，千歌万曲，唱不尽咱们工人对您的无限忠诚。
    夜深了，工人同志们激动得谁也无法入睡，他们有的伏在灯下写日记，记下这最幸福最难忘的时刻；有的靠在床边写信，希望尽快地把这特大喜讯告诉同志和亲人；有的站在桌旁，挥笔在写决心书……
    工人同志们说：“毛主席送给我们的不是芒果，而是战无不胜的毛泽东思想，是威力无比的精神原子弹。”他们纷纷表示要团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的周围，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利而战斗到底！
