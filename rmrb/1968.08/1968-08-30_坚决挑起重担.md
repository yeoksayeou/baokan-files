To the Editor,

Comrade,

Chairman Mao's latest directive has sounded the charge to carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end. It proclaims that the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools is gone forever, and a new era of workers and poor peasants leading and managing schools has begun!

Our great leader Chairman Mao has always attached great importance to the leadership role of the working class in schools. However, for a long time, the Chinese Khrushchev and his accomplices Peng Zhen, Lu Dingyi, and Zhou Yang have madly opposed Chairman Mao's great directives, creating "independent kingdoms" and actively promoting a whole set of counter-revolutionary revisionist educational lines. They used the excuse that "outsiders cannot lead insiders" and "workers and peasants do not understand education" to suppress and exclude the Party and the working class from leading schools, and to suppress and exclude students, teachers, and staff of worker and peasant origin. They implemented "expert-led schools" and "professor-led schools," allowing bourgeois intellectuals to rule our schools. For many years, they have worshipped foreign and ancient cultures, spreading a large amount of revisionist black goods such as "grades first" and "fame and fortune," attempting to turn schools into tools for cultivating bourgeois successors and into bases for restoring capitalism.

Who says the working class "does not understand education"? The working class understands proletarian education the best and cares the most about cultivating successors for the proletarian revolutionary cause! Only those bourgeois "scholars" and "authorities" do not understand proletarian education. They teach others to operate machines but cannot operate machines themselves; they teach others to write articles but cannot write articles themselves. They eat the grain grown by peasants and live in buildings constructed by workers, but they do not serve the workers and peasants. In such schools, if the working class does not take the lead, who will?

We, the working class, must closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's latest directives. We must be bold and shoulder the burden of the proletarian educational revolution, seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, and turn every one of our schools into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

    坚决挑起重担编辑同志：
    毛主席的最新指示，吹响了将无产阶级教育革命进行到底的进军号，宣告了资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，一去不复返了，由工人阶级和贫下中农领导和管理学校的崭新时代开始了！
    我们伟大领袖毛主席历来就非常重视工人阶级对学校的领导作用。但是，长期以来，中国赫鲁晓夫及其同伙彭真、陆定一、周扬之流，疯狂对抗毛主席的伟大指示，大搞“独立王国”，积极推行了一整套反革命修正主义教育路线。他们借口“外行不能领导内行”，“工人、农民不懂教育”，打击排斥党和工人阶级对学校的领导，打击排斥工农出身的学生、教师、职员，实行“专家治校”、“教授治校”，让资产阶级的知识分子统治了我们的学校。多少年来，他们崇洋拜古，大量散布“分数挂帅”、“成名成家”等修正主义的黑货，妄图把学校变成他们培养资产阶级接班人的工具，变成他们复辟资本主义的根据地。
    谁说“工人阶级不懂教育”？工人阶级最懂得无产阶级教育，最关心培养无产阶级革命事业接班人！只有那些资产阶级的“学者”“权威”才不懂无产阶级教育。他们教机器制造，自己却不会制造机器；他们教别人写文章，自己不会写文章。他们吃农民种的粮食，住工人盖的楼房，但却不为工人农民服务。在这样的学校，工人阶级不来领导，谁来领导？
    我们工人阶级一定要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚决落实毛主席的最新指示。我们要“敢”字当头，挑起无产阶级教育革命的重担，“认真搞好斗、批、改”，把我们的每个学校都办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
