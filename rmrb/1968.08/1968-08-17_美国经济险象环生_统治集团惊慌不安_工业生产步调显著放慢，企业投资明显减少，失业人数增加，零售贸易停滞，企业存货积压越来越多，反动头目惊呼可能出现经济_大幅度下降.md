The U.S. economy faces grave perils; the ruling class is in panic. Industrial production has significantly slowed, corporate investment has noticeably decreased, unemployment has risen, retail trade has stagnated, and corporate inventories are piling up. Reactionary leaders are warning of a possible "sharp economic decline."

According to Xinhua News Agency, as the heavy burden of the Vietnam War deepens the U.S. fiscal crisis, the U.S. economy is fraught with dangers, and a new production overcapacity crisis is looming. The U.S. ruling class is deeply concerned about this gloomy prospect.

The great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, has long pointed out: "The war boom in the United States is only a temporary phenomenon. Its strength is only superficial and temporary. The various irreconcilable contradictions within and outside the country are like a volcano, threatening American imperialism every day. American imperialism is sitting on this volcano." The current dire situation of American imperialism, both politically and economically, fully confirms Chairman Mao's profound judgment.

The U.S. ruling class decided in 1965 to escalate the Vietnam War, with one of its main goals being to quickly use hundreds of billions of dollars in military orders to give the then-struggling U.S. economy a "shot in the arm." However, the actual situation over the past few years has proven that the "shot in the arm" cannot cure the chronic diseases of the U.S. capitalist economy. The crisis in the U.S. economic sphere is becoming increasingly dense. First, industrial production has significantly slowed. Since the beginning of last year, a series of important industrial sectors have had to reduce production due to poor sales, and it was only because the U.S. ruling class frantically expanded military orders in the second half of the year that the annual industrial production managed to increase by one percent. This year, the growth rate of industrial production in the first five months was less than half of that in the last five months of last year; if the extra factor of steel users hoarding steel due to concerns about worker strikes is removed, the actual situation of U.S. industrial production in the first half of this year would be even worse. Second, corporate investment has noticeably decreased. The situation shows that the net investment by U.S. corporations for expanding production capacity began to decline significantly from the second quarter of last year, and compared to the same period in 1966, the net investment of corporations in the last three quarters of last year decreased by 3.9 percent, 13.5 percent, and 11.6 percent, respectively.

At the same time, unemployment has risen, retail trade has stagnated, and corporate inventories have increased. By early June, there were more than 1.63 million unsold new cars, a rare high in recent years, and the sales of cars directly affect the production of many important industrial sectors such as steel, glass, textiles, rubber, and oil. All of this not only indicates that the current U.S. economic situation is dire but also foreshadows further deterioration in industrial production.

What is particularly serious is that all these dangerous symptoms are occurring at a time when the U.S. fiscal crisis is deepening due to the ever-increasing expenditure of the Vietnam War, inflation is at an unprecedented level, and the most severe financial crisis in the capitalist world in forty years is heavily hitting the U.S., putting the dollar's position in a critical situation. This further increases the plight of the U.S. ruling class, facing the real danger of a convergence of financial and production overcapacity crises.

It is in this desperate situation that the flustered Johnson administration, regardless of the possible adverse effects on the economy, urged the U.S. Congress to pass a bill at the end of June to impose an additional 10 percent income tax surcharge, treating the tax increase as a lifeline to ease the fiscal crisis and save the dollar. However, some people in the U.S. ruling class have already admitted that this measure, which sacrifices one thing for another, is actually "drinking poison to quench thirst" and will bring fatal consequences to the U.S. economy, which is already under the shadow of a production overcapacity crisis. Soon after this bill was implemented, the New York Stock Market experienced a sharp decline, reflecting the serious concerns of Wall Street's monopoly giants about the future. Many U.S. bourgeois newspapers and capitalists are already worriedly predicting that in the coming months, the pace of U.S. industrial production will further slow down, unemployment will significantly increase, and another economic "recession" may come at the end of this year or the beginning of next year. U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Fowler also warned at a press conference on August 1 that the U.S. economy may experience a "sharp decline" in the second half of this year.

    美国经济险象环生　统治集团惊慌不安
    工业生产步调显著放慢，企业投资明显减少，失业人数增加，零售贸易停滞，企业存货积压越来越多，反动头目惊呼可能出现经济“大幅度下降”
    据新华社讯　在侵越战争的沉重负担引起美国财政危机不断加深的同时，美国经济领域内险象环生，一场新的生产过剩危机正在步步进逼。美国统治集团对这种阴暗的前景感到十分不安。
    世界革命人民的伟大导师毛主席早就深刻地指出：“美国的战争景气，仅仅是一时的现象。它的强大，只是表面的和暂时的。国内国外的各种不可调和的矛盾，就象一座火山，每天都在威胁美国帝国主义，美国帝国主义就是坐在这座火山上。”美帝国主义当前不仅在政治上而且在经济上也危机深重的狼狈处境，完全证实了毛主席的这一英明论断。
    美国统治集团在一九六五年悍然决定扩大侵越战争，其重要目的之一就是赶紧用成百亿美元的军火订货给当时已经困难重重的美国经济“打强心针”。但是几年来的实际情况证明，“强心针”根本治不了美国资本主义经济的痼疾。美国经济领域中的危机阴霾正变得越来越浓密。首先是工业生产的步调显著放慢。早自去年年初开始，就已经有一系列重要工业部门由于销路困难而被迫缩减生产，只是由于美国统治集团在下半年拚命扩大军事订货，才使全年工业生产勉强增长了百分之一。今年头五个月工业生产的增长幅度还不及去年最后五个月的一半；如果把钢铁用户由于担心工人罢工而大批囤购钢材这个刺激钢铁生产的额外因素除去，今年上半年美国工业生产的状况实际上还要糟得多。其次是企业投资明显减少。情况表明，美国企业用于扩大生产能力的纯投资额从去年第二季度开始明显下降，同一九六六年同期相比，去年后三个季度的企业纯投资额分别减少了百分之三点九、百分之十三点五和百分之十一点六。
    在这同时，失业人数增加、零售贸易停滞、企业存货增加。六月初，卖不掉的库存新汽车达到了一百六十三万余辆，是近年来少有的高峰，而汽车销路的好坏对许多重要工业部门，如钢铁、玻璃、纺织、橡胶、石油等工业的生产有着直接影响。这一切不但表明当前美国经济情况不妙，而且预示着工业生产还将进一步恶化。
    特别严重的是，所有这些危险症状是发生在侵越战争开支日益庞大引起美国财政危机不断加深、通货膨胀空前严重的时刻，是发生在资本主义世界四十年来最猛烈的金融危机沉重打击美帝，使美元地位处于千钧一发的危急关头，这就更增加美国统治集团处境的困窘。使美国面临着金融危机和生产过剩危机交集迸发的现实危险。
    正是在这种走投无路的绝望处境中，手忙脚乱的约翰逊政府不顾对经济可能产生的恶果，催促美国国会在六月底通过了一项加征所得税附加税百分之十的法案，把增税当成是可以帮它减缓财政危机、挽救美元危局的一根救命稻草。但是，美国统治集团中的一部分人已经承认，这种顾此失彼的措施实际上是“饮鸩止渴”，将会给早已处在生产过剩危机阴影下的美国经济带来致命的后果。在这个法案实行后不久，纽约股票市场接连出现猛跌，正是反映了华尔街垄断巨头们对前景的严重不安。不少美国资产阶级报刊和资本家已经在忧心忡忡地预言，今后几个月内，美国工业生产的步调还将进一步放慢，失业将大大增加，另一次经济“衰退”很可能将在今年底或明年初到来。美国财政部长福勒在八月一日的记者招待会上也惊呼美国今年下半年可能出现经济的“大幅度下降”。
