	Husain happily recalled that the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, had warmly received him and his entourage.

	He said that everywhere in China, people unanimously believe that Sino-Pakistani friendship is built on a solid foundation of mutual respect for sovereignty and cooperation in areas of common interest. He said that the Chinese people sympathize with the people of Jammu and Kashmir in their struggle to rid themselves of Indian colonial rule.

	Husain praised the comprehensive progress made by the Chinese people under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao. He also praised the self-reliant spirit of the Chinese people.

	Asad Husain and his entourage returned to Rawalpindi on Aug. 11.

	According to a report by the Pakistan News Agency on Aug. 4, Muhammad Musa, the governor of West Pakistan, condemned India's large-scale military buildup, which seriously threatens Pakistan's security.

	At a public gathering in the town of Quetta in West Pakistan, he said: If India invades again, the military and people of Pakistan will not hesitate to make any sacrifice for the motherland.

	According to a report by the Morning News, on the same day, Transport Minister Sabur Khan said at a public gathering in the town of Kurigram in East Pakistan that India's current military buildup not only threatens Pakistan's peace and security but will also destroy India itself.

	He said: The leaders of India only believe in gunboat diplomacy, creating tension to intimidate Pakistan. India's stubborn refusal to solve problems with neighboring countries has led to armed conflicts with neighboring countries China and Pakistan in the past few years.

	He said: The government and people of Pakistan are fully prepared to deal with India's challenges.

　　巴基斯坦外长赞扬中国人民的自力更生精神
　　中国人民在毛主席领导下取得全面进步
　　阿沙德·侯赛因部长表示对访问中国的结果非常满意
    新华社拉瓦尔品第十二日电　巴基斯坦外交部长阿沙德·侯赛因访问中国回国以后，十日在达卡机场对记者说，他的访问再一次肯定了和加强了两国的友谊。他表示对这次的访问结果非常满意，对中巴友好关系发展的前景充满信心。
    侯赛因高兴地谈到，中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席盛情地接见了他和他的随行人员。
    他说，在中国到处都一致认为中巴友谊是建立在互相尊重主权、在共同感兴趣的各方面进行合作的牢固基础之上的。他说，中国人民同情查谟和克什米尔人民为摆脱印度的殖民统治而进行的斗争。
    侯赛因赞扬了中国人民在伟大领袖毛主席的领导下所取得的全面进步。他还赞扬了中国人民的自力更生精神。
    阿沙德·侯赛因和他的随行人员已于十一日回到拉瓦尔品第。
    据新华社拉瓦尔品第电　据巴基斯坦报联社四日报道，西巴基斯坦省督穆罕默德·穆萨谴责印度大肆扩充军备，严重地威胁巴基斯坦的安全。
    他在西巴基斯坦的基达地方举行的一次公众集会上讲话时说：一旦再次发生印度的入侵，巴基斯坦军民就将毫不犹豫地为祖国作出任何牺牲。
    据《晨报》报道，交通部长萨布尔汗同一天在东巴基斯坦库尔纳地方的一次公众集会上讲话时说，印度现在发动的扩充军备运动，不仅威胁巴基斯坦的和平与安全，而且将毁掉印度本身。
    他说：印度的领导人只相信炮舰外交，制造紧张局势来恫吓巴基斯坦。印度拒绝同邻国解决问题的顽固态度，曾经在过去几年中造成同邻国中国和巴基斯坦的武装冲突。
    他说：巴基斯坦政府和人民已做好充分的准备来对付印度的挑战。
