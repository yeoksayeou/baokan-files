The Soviet Revisionist Group is a Ferocious Enemy of the People of Congo (Kinshasa)
Shamelessly Praising the American Imperialist Puppet Mobutu as an "Anti-Imperialist, Anti-Colonialist Hero," Whitewashing the Executioner

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on August 5th, recently, the Soviet revisionist clique has been vigorously praising the American imperialist puppet in Congo (Kinshasa), Mobutu, exonerating him of his crimes, and whitewashing him. They shamelessly portray this traitor as an "anti-imperialist, anti-colonialist hero." This once again brazenly exposes the Soviet revisionist clique's efforts to act as the number one henchman of American imperialism, betraying the interests of the African people.

A recent article in the Soviet revisionist publication "Tajik Communist" is a prime example of the Brezhnev-Kosygin clique's efforts to beautify the Mobutu puppet regime.

The world knows that the infamous Mobutu clique actively participated in the heinous crime of murdering the Congolese national hero Lumumba. This gang has the blood of the Congolese revolutionary people on their hands. However, the Soviet revisionist traitors blatantly propagate that the crime of "savagely killing Lumumba and his closest comrades, making the blood of Congolese patriots flow like rivers" has nothing to do with the Mobutu clique.

The Mobutu clique came to power with the support of American bayonets. This puppet regime has intensified the betrayal of national interests and is a die-hard traitor, the enemy of the Congolese people. However, the Soviet revisionist traitors openly shout that "General Mobutu has taken power" and "driven the most hated traitors from the political stage."

The Mobutu clique has transferred the rich resources of Congo (Kinshasa) from the hands of the old Belgian colonialists to the new American colonialists, allowing their American masters to plunder more freely. However, the Soviet revisionist traitors obsequiously shout that this is a "policy to restrict the rule of foreign monopolies," that "this victory was hard-won," and that "General Mobutu's regime has achieved some success in the struggle against foreign monopolies," and so on.

To maintain his fascist rule, Mobutu concocted a reactionary party last year. The Soviet revisionist traitors highly praised this, and using Mobutu's words, propagated that "the principles and basic goals of this party" are to follow the "positive path of nationalism."

The Mobutu puppet regime is an active servant of American imperialism, the agent of American imperialism in Congo (Kinshasa), and the executioner who suppresses the Congolese patriotic armed forces. However, the Soviet revisionist traitors shamelessly lie that the Mobutu clique is beginning to play a significant role in "anti-imperialist, anti-colonialist activities."

Under the instructions of their American masters, the Mobutu clique continually plays new tricks of deception, attempting to infiltrate the ranks of African nationalist states to sabotage the cause of African people's unity against imperialism. The evil deeds of the Mobutu clique, both domestically and internationally, have been strongly condemned by the African people and the people of the world, making them extremely embarrassed. However, the Soviet revisionist traitors boast that the "international status of the Mobutu clique has been strengthened" and shamelessly propagate that "the Mobutu government has restored diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union."

It is not surprising that the Soviet revisionist traitors are so crazy in their praise and beautification of the Mobutu clique. Since the Soviet revisionist leaders have acted as the number one henchman of American imperialism, they naturally regard the puppets supported by American imperialism and despised by the broad masses of people as their own kind. Since June 1960, when Congo (Kinshasa) declared independence, the Soviet revisionist leadership has been engaged in the evil deed of betraying the interests of the Congolese people.

The evil activities of the Soviet revisionist traitors have aroused the extreme indignation of the Congolese revolutionary people. They are increasingly aware that to oppose American imperialism and its puppets, they must also oppose the Soviet revisionist clique. The Political Committee of the Western Front of the Congolese Patriotic Armed Forces recently issued a statement pointing out: "Mobutu has not changed his nature as an American imperialist puppet. On the contrary, it is the Soviet revisionists who claim that Mobutu has changed, joining the ranks of the counter-revolution." "The Congolese people have no room for compromise with American imperialism and the Soviet revisionist clique. The Congolese people severely condemn the reactionary stance of the Soviet revisionist leaders."

### 苏修集团是刚果（金）人民的凶恶敌人　无耻吹捧美帝走狗蒙博托是反帝反殖“英雄”，为刽子手涂脂抹粉

　　苏修集团是刚果（金）人民的凶恶敌人
　　无耻吹捧美帝走狗蒙博托是反帝反殖“英雄”，为刽子手涂脂抹粉
    据新华社五日讯　近来，苏修叛徒集团大肆吹捧美帝在刚果（金）的走狗蒙博托，为他开脱罪责，涂脂抹粉，公然把这个卖国贼描绘成什么反对帝国主义和殖民主义的“英雄”。这就再一次十分露骨地暴露了苏修集团竭力充当美帝头号帮凶，出卖非洲人民利益的丑恶嘴脸。
    苏修《塔吉克共产党人》最近发表的一篇文章，就是勃列日涅夫、柯西金集团竭力美化蒙博托傀儡集团的一个例证。
    全世界人民都知道，臭名昭著的蒙博托集团曾积极参加了杀害刚果（金）民族英雄卢蒙巴的罪恶勾当，这伙匪帮双手沾满了刚果（金）革命人民的鲜血。但是，苏修叛徒却明目张胆地宣扬“野蛮地杀害了卢蒙巴及其最亲密的战友，使刚果的爱国者血流成河”的罪责，与蒙博托集团毫无关系。
    蒙博托集团是靠美国刺刀支持上台的，这个傀儡集团变本加厉地出卖民族利益，是死心塌地的卖国贼，是刚果（金）人民的死敌。但是，苏修叛徒却赤裸裸地叫嚷什么“蒙博托将军掌了权”，“把人民最憎恨的卖国者赶出了政治舞台”。
    蒙博托集团把刚果（金）的丰富资源，从比利时老殖民主义者手里转让给美国新殖民主义者，让他们的美国主子更加放手地进行掠夺。但是，苏修叛徒却肉麻地叫嚷什么这是“限制外国垄断组织统治的政策”，“这个胜利是来之不易的”，“蒙博托将军的政权在同外国垄断势力的斗争中取得了一定的成就”等等。
    蒙博托为维持其卖国集团的法西斯统治，去年炮制出一个反动政党。苏修叛徒对此大加赞扬，并且借蒙博托的话宣扬说，“这个党的原则和基本目的”是走“积极的民族主义的道路”。
    蒙博托傀儡集团是积极为美帝效劳的忠实走狗，是美帝在刚果（金）的代理人，是镇压刚果（金）爱国武装力量的刽子手。但是苏修叛徒却无耻地胡说什么蒙博托集团在“反帝国主义、反殖民主义的活动中开始起显著的作用”。
    蒙博托集团在其美国主子的授意下，不断玩弄新的欺骗花招，企图钻进非洲民族主义国家的队伍，来破坏非洲人民团结反帝事业。蒙博托集团在国内外的罪恶行径，受到非洲人民和全世界人民的强烈谴责，非常狼狈。但是，苏修叛徒却吹嘘什么蒙博托集团的“国际地位加强了”；并且无耻地宣扬“蒙博托政府同苏联恢复了外交关系”。
    苏修叛徒这样丧心病狂地吹捧和美化蒙博托集团并不奇怪。苏修叛徒既然充当美帝的头号帮凶，就必然把美帝所支持的、为广大人民所唾弃的走狗引为知己。自从一九六○年六月刚果（金）宣布独立以来，苏修领导集团就一直干着出卖刚果（金）人民利益的罪恶勾当。
    苏修叛徒的罪恶活动，激起刚果（金）革命人民的无比愤慨。他们日益清楚地认识到，要反对美帝国主义及其走狗，就必须反对苏修叛徒集团。刚果（金）爱国武装西线政治委员会最近曾发表声明指出：“蒙博托根本没有改变他的美帝走狗的本性。恰恰相反，正是硬说什么蒙博托已经改变了的苏修之流参加了反革命的行列。”“刚果人民同美帝国主义和苏修集团毫无妥协的余地，刚果人民严厉谴责苏修头目们的反动立场。”
