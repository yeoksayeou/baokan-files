Pakistani public opinion continues to expose the reactionary nature of Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's proposal to sign a "no-war pact" with Pakistan, and reveals that the Indian reactionary government is making military preparations against Pakistan.

Abdul Hamid Khan, Chairman of the Free Kashmir Government, said at a public meeting in Chirabundi on August 18 that Indira Gandhi's proposal is a deception. He said that without resolving major issues like Kashmir, such a pact cannot be signed between India and Pakistan.

The August 17 editorial of the *Mountain News* published in Rawalpindi said that the Indian government, while insisting on signing a "no-war pact" with Pakistan, does not touch the root causes of tension between the two countries. The tension in the Indian subcontinent is created by the Indian government. Now, while proposing to sign a "no-war pact," it is intensifying war preparations without eliminating the root causes of tension between the two countries, with the aim of deceiving the world's people.

According to a report in the August 17 *Dawn*, the Indian government has begun unusual military preparations along the 640-mile border with Pakistan in the Indian state of Rajasthan. Various reinforcement troops have been sent to the border area, and all military exercises in this region are strictly confidential.

The report said that at the same time, Indian government officials have recently intensified their provocative and aggressive speeches against Pakistan. Indian Defense Minister Swaran Singh, in a speech to Indian legislators, said that a large number of Indian troops have been deployed along the border. He boasted that India is militarily strong. He also said that India plans to purchase more weapons from abroad.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency in Rawalpindi on August 22, Pakistani public opinion continues to expose the hypocrisy of Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's proposal to conclude a "no-war pact" with Pakistan, and advocates vigilance against the expansionist policies of the Indian reactionary government.

The Free Kashmir Muslim Conference Working Committee recently passed a resolution at a meeting in Rawalpindi, pointing out that Indira Gandhi's proposal is a smokescreen to deceive world opinion.

The resolution expressed support for the Pakistani government's position that resolving the Kashmir issue is an indispensable condition for achieving lasting and genuine peace in the Indian subcontinent. If the Kashmir people are not given the right to self-determination, they will fight for their rights with their lives.

The August 19 editorial of the *Dawn* in Karachi pointed out that the Indian government's proposal is "a proposal by a robber who, after robbing someone's property, proposes to live in peace with the victim. This is a proposal by a chauvinistic great power that does not care about international morality, only seeking to preserve what it has gained, and dressing itself up as a peace warrior and a champion of justice, in order to realize its greater ambitions."

The August 20 editorial of the *Free Press* said that while the Indian government is busy building large numbers of military factories, and the Soviet Union and the United States are providing large quantities of weapons to India, the Indian government is deploying and increasing troops along the Indo-Pakistani and Indo-Chinese borders, and colluding with the United States to establish a new military alliance in the Far East, Indira Gandhi proposes to conclude a "no-war pact" with Pakistan. This is merely a pretense to cover up its war preparations.

### 巴基斯坦舆论揭穿印度“非战公约”的骗局  谴责印度一方面建议签订“非战公约”另一方面却在加紧进行战争准备

    巴基斯坦舆论揭穿印度“非战公约”的骗局
    谴责印度一方面建议签订“非战公约”另一方面却在加紧进行战争准备
    新华社拉瓦尔品第十九日电　巴基斯坦人士和报刊，继续揭穿印度反动政府总理英迪拉·甘地提出的同巴基斯坦签订“非战公约”的建议的反动本质，并且揭露印度反动政府正在进行反对巴基斯坦的军事准备。
    查谟和克什米尔自由政府主席阿卜杜勒·哈米德·汗十八日在契拉班迪举行的一次公众集会上说，英迪拉·甘地的建议是一个骗局。他说，不解决象克什米尔这样事关重大的问题，印巴之间决不能签订这种条约。
    拉瓦尔品第出版的《山岳报》八月十七日发表社论说，印度政府一方面坚持同巴基斯坦签订“非战公约”，另一方面却根本不触及两国之间紧张的根源。印巴次大陆的紧张局势就是印度政府制造的。现在它一方面建议签订一项“非战公约”，另一方面却在加紧进行战争准备，而不去消除两国之间紧张的根源，其目的是欺骗世界人民。
    据《黎明报》十七日报道，印度政府已开始在印度拉贾斯坦邦同巴基斯坦接壤的六百四十多英里长的边界，进行不寻常的军事准备。各种增援部队已运到边境地区，这个地区的一切军事演习都严格保密。
    报道说，同时，印度政府官员最近加紧发表反对巴基斯坦的咄咄逼人的挑衅性讲话。印度国防部长斯瓦兰·辛格向印度议员发表讲话时说，在边境一带已经部署了大批印度军队。他吹嘘说，印度在军事上是强大的。他还说，印度打算向国外购买更多的武器。
    据新华社拉瓦尔品第二十二日电　巴基斯坦舆论继续揭露印度总理英迪拉·甘地建议同巴基斯坦缔结“非战公约”的虚伪性，并主张对印度反动政府的扩张主义保持警惕。
    自由查谟和克什米尔穆斯林会议工作委员会最近在拉瓦尔品第举行的一次会议上通过一项决议，指出英迪拉·甘地的建议是欺骗世界舆论的烟幕。
    决议表示支持巴基斯坦政府的立场，即解决克什米尔问题是在印—巴次大陆实现持久的真正和平不可缺少的条件。如果不让克什米尔人民享有自决权，他们将用生命来换取他们的权利。
    卡拉奇《黎明报》八月十九日发表社论，指出印度政府的建议，“是强盗的建议，强盗抢劫了人家的财物之后，却建议同人家和平相处。这是一个沙文主义大国的建议，它不把国际道义放在眼里，只顾设法保住自己所获得的东西，把自己打扮成和平战士和主持公道的人，以实现其更大的野心”。
    《自由报》八月二十日的社论说，正当印度政府忙着兴建大批军需工厂、苏联和美国向印度提供大量武器、印度政府沿着印巴和印中边界集结和增派军队，并勾结美国在远东建立新的军事联盟的时候，英迪拉·甘地建议同巴基斯坦缔结“非战公约”。这只是一种做作，以掩盖其战争准备而已。
