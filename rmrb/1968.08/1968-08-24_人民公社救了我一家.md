The year 2018 marks the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the People's Commune and the year of the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

As the saying goes, "When one is happy, one feels spirited." Seeing the tremendous changes in Suanzhaoyu over the past ten years and the happy life of our family today, I have a thousand words and ten thousand feelings to express to Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! It is you who guided us onto the broad road of the People's Commune. It is the People's Commune that saved my family. We shout a thousand times, ten thousand times: Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!

In the old society, full of evil, our family, like countless other poor peasant families, lived a life worse than cattle and horses. Originally, our family had two rooms, at least a place to stay. But the wicked landlord had evil intentions, using deception and intimidation, forcibly seized our two rooms and incorporated them into his estate. In those days, the power was in the hands of the landlords, where could the poor find justice!

At that time, our family of eight people were guarding two mu of hillside land. One year, during the fifth lunar month, our family went for more than twenty days without eating a single grain of rice. Eight people gathered around a half pot of wild vegetable soup, crying to the heavens and the earth, but no one answered. The children, one by one, were skin and bones, lying horizontally and vertically on the kang. One day, my four-year-old son, Wutou, saw me approaching and, with big eyes, weakly said, "Mom, I want to eat some rice." I said, "Child, there is no rice!" Wutou lowered his head and said, "Give me some porridge to drink..." I helplessly told the child, "Our family doesn't even have a grain of rice, where can we get porridge?" With tears in my eyes, I pointed to the pot of wild vegetable soup and said, "Wutou, eat some wild vegetables." The child struggled and shook his head.

The next morning, I went to the mountains to dig wild vegetables. Around noon, I returned home. As soon as I entered the door, Wutou was already lying stiffly on the kang with his eyes closed. I was so anxious that I touched the child's chest, and it was already cold. I hugged Wutou, this bundle of dry sticks and bones, and cried until I almost died. I hated that old society that devoured people, and I hated that wicked landlord. Why did the deep courtyards and large mansions have a stench of wine and meat, while the poor children died without even a sip of porridge?

The East is red, the sun is rising, our great savior Mao Zedong led the people of the whole country to overthrow the "three big mountains," and we poor people took control of the power. Our family was allocated rooms and land, truly achieving political and economic liberation. However, a sudden flood washed away several mu of fertile land by the river, and our lives became difficult again. Every year, we relied on government relief. It was at this time that our great leader Mao Zedong timely guided us onto the path of mutual aid and cooperation. In 1958, the People's Commune was established. Over the past ten years, under the illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, amidst the storms of the two-line struggle, the People's Commune has grown and strengthened. Now, collective economy is greatly developed, and the living standards of the commune members have greatly improved. The commune has a solid foundation, and every household has enough food and clothing. The commune and every household have a lot of surplus grain and savings. In recent years, our family has built several large brick houses and purchased three bicycles. The road of socialism is becoming increasingly broad.

The People's Commune is also a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. Every day, we study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, and every day we criticize the bourgeoisie.

Chairman Mao said, "Only socialism can save China." The People's Commune is the lifeline of us poor and lower-middle peasants. We will forever walk the bright path of the People's Commune and forever follow Chairman Mao in revolution.

    人民公社救了我一家
    老贫农　马桂兰
    今年，是人民公社的十年大庆，也是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的一年。
    常言说得好：人逢喜事精神爽。看着酸枣峪这十年翻天覆地的变化，看着我们全家今天的幸福生活，我心里有千言万语要对毛主席讲。毛主席啊，毛主席！是您指引我们走上人民公社的康庄大道，是人民公社救了我的一家，让我们一千遍一万遍地高呼：毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！
    在万恶的旧社会，我们一家，和千千万万个穷苦农民的家一样，祖祖辈辈过着牛马不如的生活。早先，我家有两间房，总算有个藏身的地方。没想到，黑心的地主早就打了坏主意，连蒙带吓，硬把我们这两间房子霸占去，套进他的庄园里。那个世道，印把子攥在地主的手里，哪有穷人说理的地方！
    当时，我家八口人，守着二亩山坡地。有一年阴历五月，一家人二十多天没有吃到一粒粮食。一家八口人围着半锅野菜汤，叫天天不应，叫地地不语，几个孩子一个个皮包骨头，都横躺竖卧在炕上。一天，四岁的五头看我走近他，翻着大眼望着我，有气无力地说：“妈，我要吃点饭。”我说：“孩子，没有饭啊！”五头耷拉着脑袋又说：“给我点粥喝吧……”我无可奈何地对孩子说：“咱们家连粒粮食都没有，哪有粥喝啊！”我满眼泪水指着锅里的野菜汤说：“五头，你吃点野菜吧。”孩子挣扎着摇了摇头。
    第二天清早，我到山上挖野菜。快晌午时我回家来，一进屋门，五头已经闭着眼睛直挺挺地躺在炕上。我急得摸了摸孩子的胸口，早就冷了。我抱着五头这把干柴骨，哭得死去活来。我恨透了那吃人的旧社会，我恨透了那黑心的狗地主，为什么那深宅大院酒肉臭，为什么穷人的孩子临死喝不上一口粥？
    东方红，太阳升，我们受苦人的大救星毛主席，领导全国人民推倒了“三座大山”，我们穷人掌握了印把子。我家分了房分了地，真是政治、经济齐翻身。可是，一次山洪暴发，把我家河边上的几亩肥地冲得净光，生活上又开始困难起来，每年都靠政府救济。就在这个时候，我们伟大领袖毛主席及时引导我们走上了互助合作的道路。一九五八年，又成立了人民公社。十年来，人民公社在毛泽东思想光辉的照耀下，在两条路线斗争的风浪里，不断成长壮大。如今集体经济大发展，社员生活大改善，队里的底子厚，户里的衣食足，队里户里都有很多余粮和存款。这些年，我家一连盖了几间大瓦房，添置了三辆自行车，社会主义大道越走越宽广了。
    人民公社还是座毛泽东思想大学校。我们队天天都在活学活用毛泽东思想，天天批判资产阶级。
    毛主席说：“只有社会主义能够救中国。”人民公社是我们贫下中农的命根子。我们要永远走人民公社的阳关道，永远跟毛主席干革命。
