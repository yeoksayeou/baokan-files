	Chairman Mao's instructions inspire us to press on! Comrade editors:

	The stars in the sky turn towards the Big Dipper, and the sunflowers on the earth turn towards the sun!

	Chairman Mao has issued a new call to battle. He trusts the working class the most, cares for the working class the most, and supports the revolutionary pioneering spirit of the working class the most. Chairman Mao is in our hearts! In this unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution, the working class of the Guiyang Cotton Mill responded to Chairman Mao's great call to battle, seizing power from a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. Following this, in February and March of last year, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teaching that "everything should be subordinated to the needs of the front, and organizational tasks should be subordinated to political tasks," we used Mao Zedong Thought as the soul of revolutionary great unity. We smashed "selfishness" and established "selflessness," resolutely overcoming bourgeois factionalism and individualism, implementing the principle of "revolution knows no precedence, and organization knows no size," achieving revolutionary great unity throughout the factory from the bottom up by system.

	This is only a small part of what we should do, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, under the illumination of his brilliant thoughts, playing the role of the main force of the working class. Our great leader Chairman Mao discovered this new thing in a timely manner, giving us the highest honor and the greatest support, inspiring us to press on.

	Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions, the working class follows his great strategic deployment, achieving victory after victory in revolution and production. Revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination are constantly being consolidated and developed in the great storm of class struggle. All of this is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought! It is a great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

	The working class of the Guiyang Cotton Mill will not disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations, remembering his teachings, and with great enthusiasm, "fully playing the leading role of the working class in the cultural revolution and all work," at the same time, also regarding ourselves as the objects of revolution, "constantly raising our political consciousness in struggle," and swearing to carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end!

		All workers of the Guiyang Cotton Mill

    毛主席的指示鼓舞我们不断前进！编辑同志：
    天上的群星向北斗，地上的葵花朝太阳！
    毛主席向我们发出了新的战斗号召。他老人家最信任工人阶级，最关心工人阶级，也最支持工人阶级的革命首创精神，毛主席和我们心连心！在这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们贵阳棉纺厂的工人阶级响应毛主席的伟大战斗号召，夺了党内一小撮走资派的权。接着在去年二、三月份，遵照毛主席“一切为了前线的胜利，组织任务须服从于政治任务”的教导，用毛泽东思想作为革命大联合的灵魂，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，坚决克服资产阶级山头主义、个人主义，实行“革命不分先后，组织不分大小”的原则，实现了全厂自下而上的按系统的革命大联合。
    这仅仅是我们紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在他老人家光辉思想的照耀下，发挥工人阶级的主力军作用，做了一点我们应该做的工作。我们伟大领袖毛主席他老人家及时发现了这一新生事物，给予我们极高的荣誉和极大的支持，鼓舞我们不断前进。
    在毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，我们工人阶级紧跟他老人家的伟大战略部署，革命和生产取得一个又一个的胜利，革命的大联合和革命的三结合，在阶级斗争的大风浪中，不断得到巩固和发展。这一切都是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利！
    我们贵阳棉纺厂工人阶级决不辜负毛主席的期望，牢记他老人家的教导，鼓足干劲，“充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用”，同时，也把自己当作革命的对象，“在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟”，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
              贵阳棉纺厂全体工人
