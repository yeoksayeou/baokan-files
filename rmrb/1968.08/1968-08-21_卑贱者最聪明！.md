To the Editor:

Comrade Editor,

The great leader Chairman Mao recently gave us profound guidance: "Our country has 700 million people. The working class is the leading class. We must fully bring into play the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and all other work. The working class must also constantly raise its political consciousness in the course of struggle." Chairman Mao's instructions have expressed what is in our hearts and pointed out the direction for our study.

	Over the past few years, our work practice has made us deeply feel that intellectuals must humbly learn from the working class, be willing to be the working class's students, and unite with the broad masses of workers. This is the only way out.

	Several years ago, our factory, together with the relevant design units, decided to reform the existing rolling mill to meet production needs. After the news was announced, the workers happily said: "We will make a new rolling mill ourselves, great!" "Hmph! The imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries want to strangle us, that's just a pipe dream! With Chairman Mao leading us, we workers have spirit, we must definitely make the new rolling mill, make Chairman Mao proud, and bring glory to our motherland!" With boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and deep hatred for the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries, the workers, with high political enthusiasm and boundless revolutionary spirit, threw themselves into the intense battle. Whether it was the scorching summer or the cold winter, they persisted at their posts, working day and night. When the work was proceeding smoothly, suddenly difficulties arose in part of the design. If we followed the foreign materials and used screws to hold it in place, the force was not enough, and the operation was not convenient; if we did not follow the foreign methods, we had not yet found a way. "The wisest and most talented are those who have the most practical experience." The workers said: "Let's try the hydraulic method!" Following the workers' suggestions, we finally overcame the difficulty. At this moment, the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of Peng Zhen and Liu Ren's agents in our factory suddenly ordered us to dismantle all the experimental equipment and stop the experiment! At this critical moment, the workers stood up and engaged in a head-on struggle with the capitalist roaders, and the reform of the rolling mill was finally successful.

	"The lowly are the wisest! The noble are the most foolish," another new rolling mill equipment's main unit design in our factory also fully proves this great truth.

	When we were designing, someone brought in the design drawings of a certain "authority," which were as thick as fifteen centimeters! We turned them over and over, copied them over and over, but we just couldn't get out of the old framework set by the "authorities." Finally, we handed the design over to the worker comrades for discussion. Who would have thought that the worker comrades, after just one look, proposed many opinions, which were logical and convincing, making us willingly accept them. In this way, we followed the workers' suggestions and revised the design three times, finally coming up with a relatively satisfactory design plan. This design plan is more convenient to install and disassemble, and has fewer parts. The working class's daring to despise bourgeois technical "authorities," daring to revolutionize, and daring to innovate is truly worth learning from!

专栏：革命群众来信

    卑贱者最聪明！编辑同志：
    伟大领袖毛主席最近深刻地教导我们：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”毛主席的指示，说出了我们的心里话，给我们指明了学习的榜样。
    几年来的工作实践使我们深深感到：知识分子只有虚心地向工人阶级学习，甘当工人阶级的小学生，并且和广大工人群众结合在一起，才是唯一的出路。
    前几年，我厂和有关设计单位一起，为了适应生产需要，决心将原有的轧钢机加以改革。消息传出后，工人们高兴地说：“我们自己搞新的轧钢机，好哇！”“哼！帝修反想卡我们的脖子，那是白日作梦！有毛主席领导，我们工人有志气，一定要把新的轧钢机造出来，给毛主席争气，为祖国增光！”工人们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，对帝修反的无比仇恨，以高度的政治热情和冲天的革命干劲投入了紧张的战斗。不管是炎热的夏天，还是寒冷的冬天，他们都坚持在自己的工作岗位上，夜以继日地工作。工作正在顺利地进行的时候，忽然在部分设计上出现了困难，如果按照国外的资料，用螺丝顶住，力量不够，操作也不方便；如果不按国外的方法，我们还没有找到门路。“最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士”。工人们说：“用液压的方法，咱们试试看！”按照工人师傅的意见，终于闯过了难关。就在这时候，彭真、刘仁反革命修正主义集团在我厂的代理人，突然下令要我们把全部试验装置拆下去，停止试验！在这紧急关头，工人们挺身而出，与走资派进行了针锋相对的斗争，轧钢机的改装终于成功了。
      “卑贱者最聪明！高贵者最愚蠢”，我厂另一新轧钢设备的主机的设计，也充分证明这一伟大的真理。
    在我们设计的时候，有人搬来了某个“权威”设计的图纸，足足有十五公分那么厚！我们翻来翻去，抄来抄去，怎么也跳不出“权威”们设计的旧框框。最后，我们交给工人同志们讨论，哪知道工人师傅一看就提出了很多意见，说得有条有理，使我们心悦诚服。就这样，我们按照工人同志的意见一直改了三遍，终于搞出了一个比较圆满的设计方案。这个设计方案比“权威”们设计的装卸方便，零件也少。工人阶级敢于蔑视资产阶级技术“权威”，敢于革命，敢于创新的雄心壮志，是多么值得我们学习啊！
