	Welcoming the Great Wave of Struggle, Criticism, and Transformation
	—The Workers and Revolutionary People of the Capital Warmly Hail the Issuance of Chairman Mao's Latest Instructions

	Our great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "To achieve the proletarian educational revolution, it is necessary for the working class to take the lead, for the working class masses to participate, and to work together with the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army to unite with the students, teachers, and workers in schools who are determined to carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end in a revolutionary three-in-one combination. The worker propaganda teams must stay in the schools for a long time, participate in all the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and forever lead the schools. In rural areas, the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants—should manage the schools" were broadcast over the radio at 8:30 PM on August 25, spreading throughout Beijing and reaching the hearts of everyone. Everyone's face lit up with smiles, and everyone's heart was filled with sunshine! Chairman Mao, your latest instructions have pointed out the correct direction for achieving a complete victory in the proletarian cultural revolution!

	Beijing was in a festive mood, with drums and gongs echoing through the streets and alleys, and joyous crowds gathering everywhere. People cheered for Chairman Mao's latest instructions and for Comrade Yao Wenyuan's important article "The Working Class Must Lead Everything." There were so many heartfelt words that people wanted to say to Chairman Mao! People enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!" This is the strongest voice of the times, the voice of the working class and the broad masses of laboring people who are infinitely loyal to you. Chairman Mao, we will definitely advance bravely in the direction you have pointed out, welcoming the great wave of struggle, criticism, and transformation.

	Zhongnanhai is filled with joy

	The night in front of Zhongnanhai's west gate was filled with joy. Red flags fluttered, and cheers echoed through the sky. Dozens of extremely bright tungsten lamps gathered into a strong light of tens of thousands of candles, illuminating the night as if it were daytime. Double-barreled firecrackers continuously bloomed in the night sky, forming clusters of colorful stars. Firecracker sounds are a symbol of joy, a language of celebration. On this joyous day, the firecracker sounds expressed the people's love for Chairman Mao.

	Workers came, the People's Liberation Army came, students came, and the masses came, all to report the good news to Chairman Mao and express their infinite love for him. In front of the giant portrait of our great leader Chairman Mao, people continuously read aloud the joyous news with fervent enthusiasm, wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!

	Under the red flag of the National Printing Plant, two Red Guards, about seven or eight years old, respectfully held up Chairman Mao's portrait, attracting people's attention. It turned out that the female Red Guard Liu Jian was a worker's child. That night, she had just fallen asleep when she heard that the worker uncles were going to report the good news to Chairman Mao, and she couldn't sleep anymore. She quickly got up and said, "I want to report the good news to Chairman Mao and propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions!" People repeatedly persuaded her, "It's almost midnight, it's cold, stay here!" She firmly refused, and no one could stop her. She and the Red Guard Jiang Yanhu, holding up Chairman Mao's portrait, walked at the front of the procession. This procession walked from the suburbs to the city. Along the way, wherever there were people, they propagated there, reciting Chairman Mao's latest instructions to people. They didn't reach Zhongnanhai until 1 AM.

	Our beloved great leader Chairman Mao! Your latest instructions have inspired everyone. A worker from the Beijing Children's Clothing Factory heard Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the radio and quickly took notes. He found a metal plate to engrave characters, and his daughter also came to help. The father and daughter engraved and printed, and soon printed out Chairman Mao's latest instructions. This worker, along with the procession, came out to report the good news, distributing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, all the way to Zhongnanhai's west gate. He couldn't hold back the joy in his heart and told the lively story everywhere. Originally, before the parade, he went home and arranged for two children to sleep, only to see the children reciting Chairman Mao's latest instructions. He then said to them, "You sleep! Dad is going to report the good news to Chairman Mao." One said, "No, Dad, we won't sleep. We want to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions." The other said, "We've decided, we won't sleep until we memorize it." Look, our working class has such descendants who love Mao Zedong Thought, how proud we are!

	In the procession reporting the good news, revolutionary teachers and students had intimate conversations with workers. Many people decided to learn from the working class, to walk out of the maze of individualism, to walk out of the big and small "independent kingdoms," to wipe off the dust in the depths of their souls, and to unite with the workers, welcoming the great wave of struggle, criticism, and transformation.

	The east was lit up with fiery red clouds, and people spent a happy night.

	In Zhongnanhai, even more enthusiastic cheers and even louder drums and gongs formed a majestic morning song! The reporting of good news continued, and the celebration continued.

	Chairman Mao! Your latest instructions are the marching order of the proletariat, the guiding light of the revolution! Anyone who goes against your latest instructions will definitely be thrown into the garbage heap of history. Under your guidance, we will forever march from victory to victory!

    迎接伟大的斗、批、改高潮
    ——首都工人阶级和革命人民热烈欢呼毛主席最新指示的发表
    我们伟大领袖毛主席关于“实现无产阶级教育革命，必须有工人阶级领导，必须有工人群众参加，配合解放军战士，同学校的学生、教员、工人中决心把无产阶级教育革命进行到底的积极分子实行革命的三结合。工人宣传队要在学校中长期留下去，参加学校中全部斗、批、改任务，并且永远领导学校。在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校”的最新指示，在八月二十五日晚八时半，随着无线电波传遍北京城，落到每一个人的心坎上。人人脸上绽开笑容，个个心中充满阳光！毛主席啊！您的最新指示，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利，指出了准确的航向！
    北京城欢腾了，大街小巷，锣鼓喧天，到处聚集着欢乐的人群。人们欢呼毛主席的最新指示，欢呼姚文元同志的重要文章《工人阶级必须领导一切》的发表。人们有多少知心话要向毛主席说啊！人们纵情地欢呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”这是时代的最强音，这是无限忠于您的工人阶级和广大劳动人民的心声。毛主席啊！我们一定要按照您指引的方向奋勇前进，迎接伟大的斗、批、改高潮。
    中南海喜气盈门
    中南海西门前，整夜喜气盈盈。一面面红旗飞扬，一阵阵欢声震天。十几盏极亮的錪钨灯，聚集成强烈的上万烛光，把夜晚照耀得宛如白昼。双响的鞭炮连连在夜空开花，结成了彩色的星群。鞭炮声是喜庆的象征，是祝贺的语言。在这大喜的日子里，鞭炮声表达了人们热爱毛主席的心意。
    工人来了，解放军来了，学生来了，广大人民来了，都来向毛主席报喜，表示他们对毛主席的无限热爱。在我们伟大领袖毛主席的巨幅画像前，人们不断高声朗读热情洋溢的喜报，敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    在民族印刷厂的红旗下，两个七、八岁的红小兵，恭恭敬敬地共同捧着毛主席的画像，引起了人们的注意。原来，那个女红小兵刘健，是一个工人的孩子。晚上，她刚刚睡下，听说工人叔叔要去向毛主席报喜，再也睡不下去了，连忙爬了起来。她说：“我要去向毛主席报喜，宣传毛主席的最新指示！”人们再三劝她：“快半夜了，天凉，留下来吧！”她坚决不答应，谁也挡不住。她和红小兵姜燕虎，两人捧了毛主席画像，走在队伍最前面。这支队伍从郊区走到城里。一路上，哪里有人群，他们就在哪里宣传，把毛主席的最新指示念给人听。一直走到凌晨一时，他们才到了中南海。
    我们敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席啊！您的最新指示鼓舞了每一个人。北京童装厂一个职工，从收音机中听到了毛主席的最新指示，连忙记录下来。他找了钢板来刻字，他的女孩也跟着来帮忙。父女俩又刻又印，不一会，把毛主席的最新指示印了出来。这个职工随着队伍出来报喜，散发毛主席最新指示，一路走到中南海西门。他忍不住自己内心深处的喜悦，把生动的故事到处告诉给人。原来，他游行前回到家里，安排两个小孩子睡觉，只见孩子们正在那里背毛主席最新指示。他就对他们说：“你们睡吧！爸爸要去向毛主席报喜。”一个说：“不，爸爸，我们不睡。我们要学习毛主席最新指示。”一个说：“我们商量好了，背不上不睡觉。”看吧，我们工人阶级有这样热爱毛泽东思想的后代，是多么值得自豪！
    在报喜的队伍中，革命师生同工人亲切交谈。许多人决心要向工人阶级学习，走出个人主义的迷宫，走出大大小小的“独立王国”，拍掉自己灵魂深处的灰尘，同工人结合在一起，迎接伟大的斗、批、改高潮。
    东方升起火焰般的红霞，人们度过了幸福的一夜。
    在中南海，一阵阵更加热烈的欢呼，一声声更加响亮的锣鼓，组成了雄壮的晨光曲！报喜在继续，庆贺在继续。
    毛主席啊！您的最新指示，是无产阶级的进军号，是革命的指路明灯！不论什么人，要是违背您的最新指示，就一定会被抛到历史的垃圾堆里。在您的指引下，我们永远从胜利走向胜利！
