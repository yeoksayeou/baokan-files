Not long ago, the reporter visited the construction site of the Great Malësia Highway in the village of Karamendi, Skrapar District, Albania.

Karamendi village is located in the northernmost part of Albania. The residents are scattered, and transportation is inconvenient. Majestic and beautiful Alpine mountains stretch across the landscape, and steep cliffs that even the most agile goats find difficult to climb. Dense, primitive forests often cause travelers to lose their way. One morning in early spring of 1967, in this remote area, the clear bugle calls of the people's army and the sounds of explosions and pickaxes from the youth volunteers clearing the mountains echoed through the air. A highway from the border town of Han i Hotit to the northernmost residential area of Albania, the village of Vermosh, began construction. This area, due to its location in the rugged mountains, is called the Great Malësia region, meaning the great mountain region. The highway under construction is thus called the Great Malësia Highway. The highway is 70 kilometers long, like a ribbon winding through the majestic Alps. The lowest point of the highway is 900 meters above sea level, and the highest point reaches 1,400 meters. Its completion will be of great significance for the development of the fertile and beautiful Karamendi village and for strengthening national defense.

Command the Mountains to Bow, and the Forests to Make Way

On the morning of March 25 last year, the Alps were still covered in snow, but a detachment of the people's army arrived here with explosives, picks, shovels, tents, and rations for camping. They dug through more than two meters of snow to set up camp on the mountainside; they hacked through the undergrowth to build temporary shelters, a canteen, and a medical station for the youth volunteers; they broke the ice and blasted the rocks to bring spring water to the volunteer camp.

Half a month later, the Great Malësia Highway construction site, this school of volunteer labor, opened its doors. Batch after batch of young people from factories, mines, agricultural cooperatives, and schools across the country came to the construction site to work and study alongside the children of the people's army. The enthusiasm for signing up for volunteer labor was overwhelming. Some young people had never left their cities or parents, while others postponed their marriages. They rushed to the construction site. Even children and the elderly wanted to contribute to the highway's construction. A fourth-grader named Agim from Fier, only 12 years old, also signed up to work on the construction site. When people considered his age too young and did not allow him to come, he insisted repeatedly, and finally, he came to the construction site. Old man Saban had been a blaster for 32 years, participated in the national liberation war, and was exiled twice by German fascists. After liberation, he worked at the Skrapar cement factory and is now retired. As soon as he heard the news of the construction of the Great Malësia Highway, he immediately volunteered to participate in the volunteer labor. Now, he has been working as a blaster on the construction site for more than a year.

Building this highway requires leveling many small hills, moving many jagged boulders, and uprooting ancient trees that even several people cannot embrace. The work is difficult, but the Albanian youth, who have grown up under the guidance of the Labor Party and Comrade Enver Hoxha, dare to defy difficulties, overcome difficulties, and are determined to command the mountains to bow and the forests to make way. They tied ropes around themselves and hung from the cliffs to drill explosive holes. Rocks and trees, with the powerful blast, flew into the sky amidst the youth's triumphant laughter. Whether under the scorching sun or in the drizzle, the youth persisted in working. The shovel handles in their strong hands had calluses and blisters, but the youth continued to work. Sometimes, to create conditions for the next day's work, the youth, after a day of intense labor, would walk five or six hours to the foot of the mountain to carry explosives, preparing for the next day's battle.

A Great School of Communism

The Great Malësia Highway construction site is not an ordinary construction site; it is a great school of communism. Many Albanian youth, through their labor here, further promoted their ideological revolution.

Every day after work, the youth volunteers would engage in various political studies, youth league organizational life, and cultural activities. They studied the central committee's documents and Comrade Hoxha's works. Higher-level party and youth league organizations often sent people to the construction site to give political and international situation reports to the youth.

The youth volunteers, together with the soldiers of the people's army, participated in the revolutionary movement of the nearby agricultural cooperative, helping to build irrigation canals, bridges, and telephone poles, and conducting propaganda for cleanliness and hygiene. Under the guidance of the people's army, the youth volunteers often engaged in mountain climbing, marching, and shooting military training activities. They used their holidays to visit border defense posts, meet with border defense soldiers, and listen to border defense soldiers and old militia members from nearby villages recount their heroic deeds in fighting against imperialist and revisionist spies and defending the socialist motherland's borders.

Over the past year, batches of youth volunteers from all over Albania have come to the Great Malësia Highway construction site and left the site. So far, more than 12,000 young men and women have received a profound socialist and patriotic education in this great school. They have made great political and ideological gains and have also become physically stronger.

"Long Live the Albanian Labor Party!"

"Long Live Comrade Hoxha!"

Now, this 70-kilometer-long Great Malësia Highway has more than 60 kilometers of road open to traffic, with only a few kilometers left to connect. When the elderly farmers and herdsmen in the mountains saw for the first time in their lives trucks loaded with electrical equipment, tools, and fertilizers driving to their doorsteps, they were so moved that tears welled up in their eyes, shouting, "Long Live the Albanian Labor Party!" "May Comrade Hoxha live as long as the mountains of Karamendi!" An old woman from the Lepush Agricultural Cooperative even gave her hand-woven wool scarf to the first truck driver who drove to the village.

Recently, the youth volunteers unanimously proposed to exert their utmost efforts to ensure that the Great Malësia Highway is fully open to traffic as soon as possible. Their enthusiasm for work is soaring. Teams are competing in a heated socialist labor competition, and almost all teams are completing their plans ahead of schedule every day.

When the reporter left their camp, the distant sound of youth volunteers singing the song of the guerrillas going up the mountain to fight could still be heard:

"We climb the towering mountains,
Because there are guerrilla camps there..."

Looking back at the towering mountains, one can clearly see the large characters made of white stones by the youth volunteers:

"Long Live the Albanian Labor Party!"

"Long Live Comrade Hoxha!"

    山鹰的征途
    ——阿尔巴尼亚青年义务劳动者修建大马勒西亚公路纪实
    不久以前，记者访问了阿尔巴尼亚斯库台区卡尔门迪乡的大马勒西亚公路工地。
    卡尔门迪乡位于阿尔巴尼亚最北部，居民分散，交通闭塞。巍峨秀丽的阿尔卑斯山脉纵横交亘，一落千丈的悬崖峭壁连最灵巧的山羊也难于攀登，遮天蔽日的原始森林常常使行人迷路。一九六七年初春的一个早晨，就在这个交通闭塞的地区，响起了人民军嘹亮的军号声和青年义务劳动者开山劈岭的爆炸声和铁镐声。一条从靠近边境的汉尼伊霍蒂特镇起，沿着崎岖的山谷蜿蜒伸向阿尔巴尼亚最北方的一个居民区——凡尔莫希村的公路开工了。这个地区由于位于崇山峻岭之中，人们把它称作大马勒西亚地区，也就是大山地区的意思。这条正在建设中的公路也就被称作大马勒西亚公路。公路全长七十公里，象一条彩带围绕在雄伟壮丽的阿尔卑斯群山之间。公路最低点海拔为九百米，最高点达一千四百米。它的建成，将对发展富饶美丽的卡尔门迪乡和加强国防具有十分重要的意义。
      喝令高山低头，森林让路
    去年三月二十五日早晨，阿尔卑斯山还在积雪中沉睡，一支人民军带着开山的炸药、镐、锨、野营的帐篷和干粮来到这里。他们翻开两米多深的积雪，在山坡上扎营；披荆斩棘，用树枝为青年义务劳动者搭起了临时工棚、工地食堂和卫生所；破冰炸石，为义务劳动者营地引来了泉水。
    半个月以后，大马勒西亚公路工程这所义务劳动大学开学了。一批又一批来自全国各地工矿企业、农业合作社和学校的青年来到工地，同人民子弟兵一起劳动和学习。报名参加义务劳动的青年十分踊跃。有的青年从来没有离开过城市和父母，有的年轻人推迟了婚期，他们争先恐后地来到了工地。甚至小孩和老人也愿为公路的建设尽自己的力量。发罗拉市一位名叫阿吉姆的四年级小学生，今年才十二岁，也报名来工地参加义务劳动。当人们考虑到他的年龄太小，不让他来，他再三坚持，最后还是来到了工地。萨班老大爷当过三十二年的爆破工，曾经参加过民族解放战争，两次被德国法西斯流放国外，解放后，在斯库台水泥厂工作，目前退休在家。他一听到修建大马勒西亚公路的消息，就马上自动跑来参加义务劳动。现在，他在工地上已经又当了一年多的爆破工了。
    修建这条公路，必须削平许多小山岗，搬走许多嶙峋巨石，拔除几个人都合抱不了的千年大树。工作是困难的，但是在劳动党和霍查同志教导下成长起来的阿尔巴尼亚青年，敢于藐视困难，克服困难，决心喝令高山低头，森林让路。他们用绳子系在身上，悬在悬崖峭壁间去打炸药孔。岩石、大树，随着强大的爆炸气浪，在青年们一片胜利的欢笑声中，飞向天空。不管是烈日当头，还是细雨连绵，青年们始终坚持干活。铁锨柄握在强有力的双手中，把双手磨出了厚茧和血泡，但青年们仍然坚持干活。有时候，为了给明天的工作创造条件，青年们在一天紧张劳动之后，又步行五、六小时，到山下去背炸药，准备明天新的战斗。
      共产主义的大学校
    大马勒西亚公路工地，不是一个普通的工地，它是一所伟大的共产主义的大学校。许许多多阿尔巴尼亚青年，通过在这里的劳动，进一步促进了自己的思想革命化。
    每天劳动之余，青年义务劳动者都要进行各种政治学习、青年联盟的组织生活和各种文化活动。他们学习党中央文件和霍查同志的著作。上级党和青年联盟组织常常派人到工地来为青年们作政治和国际形势报告。
    青年义务劳动者还同人民军战士一起，参加附近农业社的革命化运动，帮助农业社修水渠、筑桥、架电线杆和进行清洁卫生的宣传工作。在人民军的指导下，青年义务劳动者还经常进行爬山、行军和射击等军训活动。他们利用假日参观边防军哨所，同边防军战士会见，听边防军和附近村子里的老民兵讲述同帝修特务斗争，保卫社会主义祖国边疆的英勇事迹。
    一年多来，阿尔巴尼亚全国各地的青年义务劳动者，一批批来到大马勒西亚公路工地、又一批批离开了工地。到目前为止，已有一万二千名男女青年在这所大学校里受到了一次深刻的社会主义和爱国主义教育。他们在政治思想上有了很大的收获，同时身体也锻炼得更结实了。
      “阿尔巴尼亚劳动党万岁！”
          “霍查同志万岁！”
    现在，这条长达七十公里的大马勒西亚公路已有六十多公里的路程通车了，只剩下几公里的地段还没有连接起来。当山区里的老农民和老牧民生平第一次看到满载着电工器材、农具和化肥的汽车开到自己家门口的时候，激动得热泪盈眶，高呼：“阿尔巴尼亚劳动党万岁！”“祝霍查同志象卡尔门迪的高山一样长寿！”勒普什农业社的一位老太太还把自己亲手织的羊毛围巾送给了第一个开车到这个村的汽车司机。
    最近，青年义务劳动者一致提出要以最大的努力保证大马勒西亚公路尽早全程通车。他们的劳动热情越来越高涨。队与队之间展开了热火朝天的社会主义劳动竞赛，几乎所有的队都是天天超额完成计划。
    当记者离开他们的营地时，远远还听到青年义务劳动者在唱着当年游击队上山战斗的歌曲：
    “我们攀登崇山峻岭，
    因为那里有游击队的军营，
        ……”
    回头环视巍峨耸立的大山，可以清楚地看到青年义务劳动者用白石嵌成的大字：
      “阿尔巴尼亚劳动党万岁！”
      “霍查同志万岁！”　新华社记者
