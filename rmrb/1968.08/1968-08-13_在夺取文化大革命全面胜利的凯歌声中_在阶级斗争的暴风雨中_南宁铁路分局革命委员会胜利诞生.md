In the triumphant song of seizing comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution, in the storm of class struggle, the Revolutionary Committee of Nanning Railway Bureau is born in victory.

The proletarian revolutionaries and the broad revolutionary workers of the Nanning Railway region, remembering Chairman Mao's teachings of "never forgetting class struggle," have smashed the plots of the class enemy to sabotage the Cultural Revolution and railway transportation. They have focused on the revolution and vigorously promoted production, ensuring that the trains on the more than 700 kilometers of railway lines under the bureau run smoothly day and night.

New China News Agency, Nanning, August 11 - Under the brilliant guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, amidst the triumphant song of the billion people nationwide seizing comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution, the Revolutionary Committee of Nanning Railway Bureau was born in victory amidst the storm of class struggle. This is a victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, a victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, class struggle in the Nanning Railway Bureau has been extremely sharp and complex. The Chinese Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, along with their agents in Guangxi and the railway system, colluded with the remnants of the Kuomintang and untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists to incite the masses to fight each other. They attempted to sabotage the Cultural Revolution in the Nanning Railway region and disrupt railway transportation. The proletarian revolutionaries and broad revolutionary workers of the Nanning Railway region, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, closely united with the People's Liberation Army, remembered Chairman Mao's teachings of "never forgetting class struggle," and resolutely implemented the spirit of the national railway and transportation conference, personally approved by the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao. They engaged in a head-on struggle with the class enemy, smashing the various plots of the class enemy to sabotage the Cultural Revolution and railway transportation. They focused on the revolution and vigorously promoted production. Under the guidance of the great, invincible proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao, and on the basis of the revolutionary workers and other revolutionary masses implementing revolutionary great unity, the handful of vicious class enemies were completely and shamefully defeated. So far, 75 units in the entire bureau have successively established revolutionary committees, revolutionary leading groups, or revolutionary and production leading groups. The few units that have not yet established revolutionary committees or revolutionary leading groups have now also reached agreements on implementing revolutionary three-in-one combinations. Since last year, on the more than 700 kilometers of railway lines from Pingxiang to Zhanjiang under this bureau, trains loaded with goods and passengers have run smoothly day and night, contributing to the development of the country's industrial and agricultural production and market supply, and supporting the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world.

On August 3, more than 5,000 revolutionary workers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the Nanning Railway Bureau, fighting on the Pingxiang to Zhanjiang railway line, celebrated the glorious birth of the Revolutionary Committee of Nanning Railway Bureau with great revolutionary enthusiasm in Nanning. At the celebration meeting, people repeatedly raised their arms and shouted, "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!" "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

At the meeting, Comrade Wu Hua, deputy commander of the Guangxi Military Region, spoke on behalf of the preparatory committee of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee, the Guangxi Military Region, and the Nanning garrison. Comrade Ma Wenchun, deputy chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Nanning Railway Bureau, Comrade Wu Zhuanguo, standing committee member of the Revolutionary Committee of Nanning, Comrade Zhang Xichen, deputy chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Liuzhou Railway Bureau, and representatives of revolutionary workers in the Nanning Railway region also spoke at the meeting. They expressed in their speeches that they would definitely further implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, resolutely carry out all the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasp the direction of the revolutionary struggle, deeply and persistently carry out revolutionary criticism, and thoroughly clean up the class ranks. They would launch a fierce attack on the class enemy, further strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, and continuously consolidate and develop the newly born revolutionary committees to seize comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution. They would better implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," quickly launch a new high tide of transportation and production, seize double victories in revolution and production, and make new contributions to better completing the task of aiding Vietnam and resisting America. They would further implement Chairman Mao's great call of "support the army and love the people," believe in and rely on the army, support and love the army, learn from and help the army, be vigilant against the class enemy's plots to sow discord between the army and the people, strengthen military-civilian unity, and resolutely defend the great iron wall of the People's Liberation Army.

The meeting, amidst extremely enthusiastic applause, passed a telegram of respect to the great leader Chairman Mao.

    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，南宁铁路分局的阶级斗争一直十分尖锐复杂。中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮最大的走资派及其在广西和铁路系统的代理人，网罗国民党的残渣余孽和没有改造好的地富反坏右分子，挑动群众斗群众，妄图破坏南宁铁路地区的无产阶级文化大革命，破坏铁路运输。用毛泽东思想武装起来的南宁铁路地区无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工，紧紧地和人民解放军团结在一起，牢记毛主席的“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，坚决贯彻伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席亲自批准召开的全国铁路、交通会议精神，同阶级敌人进行了针锋相对的斗争，粉碎了阶级敌人破坏文化大革命和铁路运输的种种阴谋诡计，狠抓革命，猛促生产。在伟大的、战无不胜的毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，在革命的工人阶级和其他广大革命群众实行革命大联合的基础上，一小撮狠毒的阶级敌人完全可耻地、狼狈不堪地失败了。到目前为止，全分局已有七十五个单位先后成立了三结合的革命委员会、革命领导小组或抓革命促生产领导小组，尚未建立革命委员会或革命领导小组的一小部分单位，现在也都达成了实现革命三结合的协议。从去年以来，在这个分局所属单位的凭祥至湛江的七百多公里的铁路线上，满载货物和旅客的列车日夜畅通无阻，为祖国工农业生产的发展和市场供应，为支援世界人民的革命斗争，作出了贡献。

    大会在极其热烈的掌声中，通过了给伟大领袖毛主席的致敬电。
