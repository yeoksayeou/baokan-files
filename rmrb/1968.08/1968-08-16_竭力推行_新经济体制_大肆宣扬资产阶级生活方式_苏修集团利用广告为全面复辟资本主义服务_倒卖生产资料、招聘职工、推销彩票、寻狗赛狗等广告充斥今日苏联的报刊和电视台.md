The Soviet revisionist clique has been using newspapers and television to promote a variety of advertisements, strenuously pushing the "new economic system" centered on capitalist profit principles, and promoting the decadent bourgeois lifestyle, poisoning the Soviet people.

The Soviet revisionist renegades' tactics are entirely plagiarized from the capitalist world. Today, the advertisements flooding Soviet newspapers are almost identical to those in Western newspapers. They are varied and bizarre, including the sale of production materials, recruitment of workers, promotion of lotteries, life insurance, family celebrations, divorce announcements, finding and racing dogs, and so on. Additionally, a so-called "Commercial Advertising Association" has been established.

Among the numerous advertisements in Soviet newspapers, it is particularly noteworthy that many factories, enterprises, and research institutions publish advertisements for the free buying, selling, and leasing of various production materials, houses, and offices. At the same time, Soviet revisionist newspapers continuously hype the "prosperity" of various factories and enterprises freely buying and selling machine tools, cranes, generators, instruments, seamless steel pipes, and the like, vigorously advocating the free trade of various production materials.

Among the various advertisements in Soviet revisionist newspapers, recruitment advertisements occupy a particularly prominent position. Due to the "new system" implemented by the Soviet revisionists, which grants enterprise leaders greater and more privileges, they have the power to hire and fire workers at will, artificially creating a massive unemployed workforce as an industrial reserve army. This has become an important means for the Soviet privileged class to intensify political persecution and economic exploitation of the working class. Meanwhile, various enterprises, in pursuit of high profits, poach from each other. In the recruitment advertisements for technical personnel published in newspapers, they all boast about the "preferential conditions" and material incentives of their units, using fame and fortune as bait.

The Soviet revisionist clique also spares no effort in using its television and newspapers to serve Western capitalists. At the end of last year, a major shoe company in Britain purchased airtime on Moscow Television for over seven hundred pounds per minute to advertise in the Soviet Union. The Soviet revisionist renegades willingly act as slaves to Western monopolistic capital, truly shameless.

Soviet revisionist higher education institutions also promote fame and fortune in their recruitment advertisements. The Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology boasted in an advertisement in the "Komsomolskaya Pravda" that the teachers in the institute are all "great scientists, experts, academicians," and so on. Some schools promise in their recruitment advertisements that graduates will be assigned to work in Moscow. Other schools宣扬 that students can earn a certain amount of stipend per month while studying and a certain amount of rubles per month after graduation.

The Soviet revisionist renegades extensively promote various commodities needed by the bourgeois privileged class and the bourgeois lifestyle. For example, the "Soviet Tatarstan" newspaper published a full-page advertisement for "beautiful gifts." A jewelry store shamelessly said in an advertisement, "If you want to bring joy to your beloved woman, please visit the jewelry store." The advertisement also featured a half-body image of a "modern" woman with a necklace and jewels around her neck. The Moscow Textile Company placed large advertisements promoting various expensive fabrics for "evening gowns" and "wedding gowns," as well as various strange and exotic clothing styles.

The Soviet revisionist renegades also extensively promote "lotteries" and "life insurance" to extort rubles and corrupt people's thoughts. The "Moscow Evening News" promoted lotteries in an advertisement, boasting, "Thirty, sixty, ninety kopecks can turn into cars, pianos, refrigerators, and other valuable items." The Soviet State Life Insurance Bureau published an advertisement under the title "Mothers and Fathers! Grandmothers and Grandfathers!" extensively promoting a newly opened insurance business for children under twelve years old.

Among the various advertisements in Soviet revisionist newspapers, there are many private advertisements for the sale and purchase of villas, gardens, foreign pianos, foreign postcards, and the like. Some advertisements say they want to sell a well-equipped two-story villa, some want to sell speedboats and boat engines, some want to sell gardens, and so on. In addition, there are many advertisements for private tutoring in foreign languages, tutoring for university students, private translation services, buying and selling of ancient medals, badges, and coins.

Soviet revisionist newspapers also frequently publish advertisements for dog racing and dog shows. The "Moscow Hunting Dog Club" placed large advertisements for continuous dog racing and dog shows, and the Soviet revisionists even broadcasted the live dog show on television, truly boring to the extreme!

The Soviet revisionist clique's imitation of the capitalist world to promote various bizarre advertisements is just a small episode in their comprehensive restoration of capitalism. However, even from this point, it can be seen how far Brezhnev and Kosygin have degenerated.

    竭力推行“新经济体制”　大肆宣扬资产阶级生活方式
    苏修集团利用广告为全面复辟资本主义服务
    倒卖生产资料、招聘职工、推销彩票、寻狗赛狗等广告充斥今日苏联的报刊和电视台
    新华社十五日讯　莫斯科消息：最近以来，苏修叛徒集团利用苏联报刊和电视大搞五花八门的广告，竭力推行以资本主义利润原则为核心的“新经济体制”，宣扬腐朽的资产阶级生活方式，毒害苏联人民。
    苏修叛徒所搞的这一套，完全是抄袭资本主义世界的。今天充斥苏联报刊的广告，和西方报刊的广告几乎一样。真是形形色色，无奇不有，什么倒卖生产资料、招聘职工、推销彩票、人身保险、家庭喜庆、离婚声明、寻狗赛狗，等等，等等。此外，还成立了一个所谓“商业广告联合会”。
    在苏联报刊上登载的大量广告中，特别值得注意的是，许多工厂、企业和科研单位刊登广告，自由买卖和租赁各种生产资料、房屋、办公处所等等。与此同时，苏修报刊还不断渲染各工厂企业自由买卖机床、起重机、发电机、仪器、无缝钢管等的“盛况”，竭力鼓吹各种生产资料的自由买卖。
    在苏修报刊登载的各种广告中，招聘人员的广告占相当突出的地位。由于苏修制定的“新体制”给予企业领导人更大和更多的特权，他们有权自行解雇和招收工人，这就人为地造成一个庞大的失业队伍作为产业后备军，成为苏联特权阶层加紧对工人阶级进行政治迫害和经济剥削的重要手段。同时，各企业为了追逐高额利润，互相挖墙脚，在报刊上登载的招聘技术人员的广告中，都极力吹嘘该单位有什么“优惠条件”，有多少物质刺激等等，用名利来作诱饵。
    苏修叛徒集团还不遗余力地利用其电视台和报刊为西方资本家服务。去年年底，英国一家最大的制鞋公司，就曾以一分钟七百多英磅的代价，向莫斯科电视台购得了放映时间，在苏联大作广告。苏修叛徒甘心情愿地充当西方垄断资本的奴仆，真是无耻之极。
    苏修的高等院校在招生广告中，也大搞名利刺激。莫斯科物理技术学院在《共青团真理报》刊登的招生广告中吹嘘在该院任教的都是“大科学家、专家、院士”等等。有的学校在招生广告中还许愿说毕业生都分配在莫斯科工作。有的学校则宣扬，在该校学习每月可以拿到多少助学金，毕业后每月可以拿到多少卢布的工资。
    苏修叛徒大肆宣扬资产阶级特权阶层所需要的种种商品和资产阶级生活方式。例如，《苏维埃鞑靼报》曾以整版篇幅刊登所谓
  “漂亮的礼物”的广告。有一家珠宝玉器商店在广告中不知羞耻地说，“如果您希望”“给您亲爱的女人带来愉快的话，请您光临珠宝商店”。广告上还画了一个“摩登”女人的半身像，脖子上挂着项链、宝石等等。莫斯科纺织品公司大登广告，宣扬什么“夜礼服”、“婚礼服”的贵重料子以及种种奇式怪样的服装。
    苏修叛徒大搞“彩票”、“人寿保险”之类的玩艺，来搜刮卢布和腐蚀人们的思想。《莫斯科晚报》在推销彩票的广告中鼓吹，“三十——六十——九十个戈比，就可以变成汽车、钢琴、冰箱和其它贵重物品”。苏修国家人寿保险局在《妈妈们和爸爸们！奶奶们和爷爷们：》的标题下刊登一则广告，大肆吹嘘新开办的一项为十二岁以下儿童保险的业务。
    在苏修报刊的各种广告中，有不少私人出售和购买别墅、花园、外国钢琴、外国明信片等等的启事。有的广告说要出售设备完善的二层楼房的别墅，有的要卖汽艇和船用发动机，有的要卖花园，等等。此外，私人教授外文、补习、为大学生答疑，私人招揽翻译，买古勋章、奖章和硬币的广告也很多。
    苏修报刊还经常刊登什么赛狗、狗展等广告。“莫斯科猎犬俱乐部”就大登连续举办赛狗、狗展的广告，苏修并且用电视演出狗展实况，真是无聊透顶！
    苏修叛徒集团模仿资本主义世界大搞无奇不有的广告，只不过是他们全面复辟资本主义的一个小小插曲。但是，就是从这一点也可以看出，勃列日涅夫和柯西金之流已经堕落到何等地步。
