At a time when the entire Party, the entire military, and the hundreds of millions of revolutionary people of the nation, under the leadership of the Proletarian Headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, are united as one, pressing forward to seize a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a handful of enemies of the proletariat, unwilling to face their doom, are once again using the reactionary "multi-center theory" to attempt to disperse the unity of the revolutionary ranks based on Mao Zedong Thought, obstructing the implementation of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. This evil wind blowing from the gutters is infiltrating the minds of a small number of people in our revolutionary ranks whose heads have swollen. Influenced by the reactionary "multi-center theory," they insist on their own "center." These people do not seriously study or apply Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's latest directives but instead act from the needs of their own small groups, taking a utilitarian attitude towards the highest directives. They do not firmly implement and thoroughly carry out the battle orders of the Proletarian Headquarters but instead implement those that suit their tastes and do not implement those that do not. They judge right and wrong not by Mao Zedong Thought, not by the orders of the Proletarian Headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, not by the fundamental interests of the proletariat, but by the narrow interests of their own cliques. They have joined the revolutionary great alliance and entered the revolutionary three-in-one combination, but they still cannot forget their own little hills. They often raise their hands in support of collective decisions in front but do not seriously implement them behind the scenes. Although these "centered on myself" people are a small number, their erroneous thoughts are very harmful. They are beneficial to the class enemies and not to the revolution. If allowed to develop, they will go down the wrong path of opposing the Proletarian Headquarters. We must give these people a resounding slap, making everyone alert, uniting as one, and waging a resolute struggle against the reactionary "multi-center theory."

Great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Communist Party of China is the core leadership of all the people of China. Without such a core, the cause of socialism cannot be victorious." The history of decades of revolutionary struggle tells us that every great victory achieved by the Chinese revolution is the result of the entire Party, the entire military, and the people of the entire nation, closely uniting around the leadership core of the Proletarian Headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, and waging a bitter struggle against all class enemies. Long-term revolutionary struggle practice has formed a belief in the hearts of the broad revolutionary masses: following Chairman Mao is victory, following Chairman Mao is happiness! The Proletarian Headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin represents the fundamental interests of the proletariat. It is the only leadership core for the entire Party, the entire military, the entire nation, and the broad revolutionary masses. The entire Party, the entire military, and the entire nation can only have such a core and cannot have a second core. Unlimited loyalty to this leadership core, resolute followership of this leadership core, and brave defense of this leadership core are the highest battle duties of every revolutionary fighter. Anyone who tries to shake and destroy this leadership core, we will resolutely struggle against them.

The so-called "multi-center theory" is purely a lie used by class enemies to deceive people. In the current fierce struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, if one is of the proletariat, one must necessarily take the Proletarian Headquarters as the center; if one is of the bourgeoisie, one must necessarily take the bourgeois headquarters as the center. Not belonging to this center necessarily means belonging to that center; not standing on this side necessarily means standing on that side. Those who advocate "centered on myself," the bourgeois headquarters is constantly beckoning to them. "Centered on myself" is essentially "centered on the self." If these people do not wake up soon and quickly turn back, they will slide into a dangerous pit. In the history of the proletarian revolution, there are many such lessons. Those who, with Marxism-Leninism, advocated independence and "centered on myself," and insisted on not changing, have not all become criminals of history?

The reactionary "multi-center theory" has always been a poisoned wine and sugar-coated cannonball used by the bourgeoisie to fight against the proletariat, a very vicious means to disintegrate and disperse the revolutionary ranks from within, a great enemy of the Party, the people, and the revolution. With the enemy in front, we must resolutely overthrow it! At this crucial moment of seizing a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must wage a resolute, uncompromising struggle against this reactionary thought, thoroughly overthrow it, and resolutely eliminate it, not allowing it any room to exist within our revolutionary ranks. At present, we must closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, deeply carry out the revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticize the revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the railway system, especially to criticize and expose the reactionary "multi-center theory" of the bourgeoisie, thoroughly smash their evil plot to sabotage the proletarian leadership core; at the same time, within our revolutionary ranks, carry out active ideological struggle, thoroughly overcome the tendencies of factionalism, sectarianism, individualism, and anarchism, reform the bourgeois worldview, strengthen ideological revolutionization, and prevent various bourgeois political dust from invading our healthy bodies. What is particularly important is to make every effort to study and apply Chairman Mao's works and Chairman Mao's series of latest directives, resolutely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, forever maintain unlimited loyalty to the Proletarian Headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, under the orders of the Proletarian Headquarters, unify wills, unify steps, unify actions, and seize a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

　　同反动的“多中心论”作针锋相对的斗争
　　吉林省长春铁路分局革命委员会
    正当全党、全军和全国亿万革命人民，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的领导下，团结一致，乘胜前进，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的关键时刻，一小撮无产阶级的敌人，不甘心他们的灭亡，又利用反动的“多中心论”，妄图涣散革命队伍在毛泽东思想基础上的团结，阻挠毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的贯彻执行。这股从阴沟里刮起来的歪风，侵袭着我们革命队伍中极少数头脑膨胀的人。他们受反动的“多中心论”的影响，坚持搞什么“以我为中心”。这些人，对毛泽东思想，对毛主席的最新指示，一不认真学，二不认真用，而是从自己小团体的需要出发，对最高指示采取实用主义的态度。他们对无产阶级司令部的战斗号令，不是坚决贯彻，彻底执行，而是符合自己口味的就执行，不符合自己口味的就不执行；他们判断是非不是以毛泽东思想，以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的号令，以无产阶级的根本利益为标准，而是以自己狭隘集团的私利为标准；他们参加了革命的大联合，进入了革命的三结合，还是念念不忘自己的小山头，对集体的决定，往往是当面举手拥护，背后又不认真执行。这种“以我为中心”的人虽然是极少数，但他们的错误思想的危害是很大的，它有利于阶级敌人，而不利于革命。如果听其发展下去，就会走到同无产阶级司令部相对抗的错误道路上去。我们必须对这些人击一猛掌，使大家都警觉起来，团结一致，向反动的“多中心论”作针锋相对的斗争。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“中国共产党是全中国人民的领导核心。没有这样一个核心，社会主义事业就不能胜利。”几十年革命斗争的历史告诉我们，中国革命所取得的每一个伟大胜利，都是由于全党、全军和全国人民，紧紧团结在以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部这个领导中心周围，和一切阶级敌人进行艰苦奋战的结果。长期的革命斗争实践，在广大革命人民心中形成了一个信念：紧跟毛主席就是胜利，紧跟毛主席就是幸福！以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，代表了无产阶级的根本利益，它是全党、全军、全国和广大革命人民群众唯一的领导中心。全党、全军、全国只能有这样一个中心，不能有第二个中心。无限忠于这个领导中心，坚决紧跟这个领导中心，勇敢保卫这个领导中心，是每个革命战士最高的战斗职责。谁想动摇和破坏这个领导中心，我们就和他坚决斗争。
    所谓“多中心论”，纯粹是阶级敌人用来骗人的鬼话。在当前两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈搏斗中，是无产阶级，就必然以无产阶级司令部为中心；是资产阶级，就必然以资产阶级司令部为中心。不属于这个中心，就必然属于那一个中心，不站在这一边，就站在那一边。搞“以我为中心”的人，资产阶级司令部在不断地向他招手。“以我为中心”，实质上是以“私”字为中心，这些人如果不及早猛醒，迅速回头，就会滑到危险的泥坑里去。在无产阶级革命的历史上，这样的教训是很多的。那些跟马克思列宁主义闹独立性，搞“以我为中心”，而又坚持不改的人，不是一个一个都成为历史的罪人了吗？
    反动的“多中心论”，历来就是资产阶级向无产阶级作斗争的鸩酒和糖衣炮弹，是从内部来瓦解和涣散革命队伍的一种极其恶毒的手段，是党的大敌，人民的大敌，革命的大敌。大敌当前，我们必须坚决打倒它！在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的关键时刻，我们对这种反动思想，尤其需要对它作针锋相对的、毫不妥协的斗争，把它彻底打倒，坚决肃清，不让它在我们革命队伍内部有存在的余地。当前，我们一定要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，深入开展革命大批判，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其在铁路系统的代理人所推行的修正主义路线，特别要批倒批臭资产阶级的反动的“多中心论”，彻底粉碎他们破坏无产阶级领导中心的罪恶阴谋；同时，在我们革命队伍内部展开积极的思想斗争，彻底克服山头主义、宗派主义、个人主义和无政府主义倾向，改造资产阶级世界观，加强思想革命化，防止各种资产阶级的政治灰尘侵蚀我们健康的肌体。特别重要的是，要百倍努力地活学活用毛主席著作和毛主席的一系列最新指示，坚决紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，永远保持对以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的无限忠诚，在无产阶级司令部的号令下，统一意志，统一步伐，统一行动，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
