The Thai people's armed forces have achieved major victories, actively propagating and mobilizing the masses, and launching campaigns to eliminate traitors and suppress tyrants, which have been warmly welcomed and supported by the people.

Xinhua News Agency, August 7th: According to "The Voice of the Thai People" radio, the people's armed forces led by the Communist Party of Thailand have, since July, actively carried out anti-enemy operations in many regions. They have also vigorously mobilized the peasant masses, achieving significant victories.

The people's armed forces have repeatedly attacked enemy strongholds and ambushed reactionary Thai and American military and police forces oppressing the people. They have actively propagated and mobilized the masses, launching campaigns to eliminate traitors and suppress tyrants, dealing a heavy blow to the reactionary Thai and American forces, and receiving warm welcome and support from the broad masses of the people.

According to the radio station, the people's armed forces in the northeastern region, who are currently engaged in anti-"encirclement" struggles, have become more active in the past month. They have deeply penetrated into the vast rural areas of Nakhon Phanom, Sakhon Nakhon, Loei, Kalasin, Udon Thani, and Ubon Ratchathani provinces, conducting extensive propaganda and mobilizing the masses. At the end of July, a unit of the people's armed forces entered the direct jurisdiction county of Udon Thani to conduct propaganda and mobilize the masses. They bravely defeated the reactionary military and police forces that came to suppress them.

According to reports, on July 26, the people's armed forces in Udon Thani bravely attacked the Udon Thani U.S. Air Force base, achieving a major victory. They destroyed several enemy aircraft and eliminated a batch of American invaders. Recently, the people's armed forces in Kalasin Province have engaged in two fierce battles with the enemy and, with the support of the masses, punished several enemy spies.

In July, the people's armed forces in Chiang Rai and Nan Provinces in northern Thailand engaged in more than ten fierce battles with the enemy, killing and wounding many enemy personnel. They also cleverly set up landmines and traps, causing more than a hundred enemy personnel to be killed by mines or fall into traps.

Recently, the people's armed forces in Phitsanulok Province in central Thailand sent an armed propaganda team to Korat County to propagate and organize the masses. The people's armed forces in Phetchabun Province also launched two successful attacks against the enemy.

In the past month, the people's armed forces in the southern provinces of Lopburi, Pattani, Surat Thani, and Yala have frequently taken the initiative, actively propagated to the masses, and punished a batch of enemy spies, receiving the welcome and support of the masses.
