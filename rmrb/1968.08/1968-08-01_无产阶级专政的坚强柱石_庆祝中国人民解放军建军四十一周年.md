At this moment of our complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the entire military and civilian population of the nation joyfully celebrates the 41st anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army, which was personally founded and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin Biao.

The glorious history of the People's Liberation Army is the history of the triumph of Chairman Mao's great thoughts on people's war and people's army, the history of the triumph of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and the history of establishing and consolidating the revolutionary regime under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party with Chairman Mao at its helm.

Over the past few decades, relying on this people's army, our Party has defeated powerful domestic and foreign enemies, established a great People's Republic of China, and defended the socialist mountains. Today, our proletariat is able to launch this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, successfully carrying out the great struggle to prevent the restoration of capitalism and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat. The most fundamental reason is that we have the great leader of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, whose prestige is unparalleled, and whose Mao Zedong Thought is invincible. We have billions of revolutionary people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. At the same time, we also have a People's Liberation Army that holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, is infinitely loyal to the Party, to the people, and to Chairman Mao. This great wall is an indispensable force.

Our great teacher Chairman Mao, in the great program for the construction of our Party and army—the Resolution of the Gutian Conference, taught us: "The Chinese Red Army is a armed group that carries out revolutionary political tasks. Especially now, the Red Army is not just about fighting. Besides fighting to annihilate the enemy's military force, it must also undertake major tasks such as propagating to the masses, organizing the masses, arming the masses, helping the masses to establish revolutionary regimes, and even building Communist Party organizations."

The fundamental issue of the revolution is the issue of power. Propagating to the masses, organizing the masses, arming the masses, and helping the masses to build revolutionary regimes, are Chairman Mao's consistent military thoughts, the fundamental tasks of the People's Liberation Army, and the glorious tradition of our army since the Jianxi-Shaanxi period.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao issued the great call: "The People's Liberation Army should support the broad masses of the left," pointing out that military representatives should participate in revolutionary committees at all levels. The People's Liberation Army supports the proletarian revolutionary factions in seizing power from a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. Military representatives directly participate in the revolutionary committees at all levels formed by the three-in-one combination. This is a great strategic measure to strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, an important development of Chairman Mao's proletarian military thought, an important component of Chairman Mao's great theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and a great contribution to Marxist-Leninist state theory.

Under the guidance of this brilliant thought of Chairman Mao, the People's Liberation Army has made new contributions to defending and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, establishing great merits and demonstrating the powerful force of the pillars of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

This army, with infinite loyalty to Chairman Mao, enthusiastically propagates Mao Zedong Thought, widely disseminates the call by Vice Chairman Lin Biao to study Chairman Mao's works actively and apply them to practice, emphasizing proletarian politics, and powerfully promotes the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought throughout the nation.

This army is highly vigilant and bravely fights, guarding our country's borders, seas, and skies, enabling our people to successfully carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution amidst the frenzied anti-China clamor of the imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries.

This army firmly supports the broad masses of the left, closely follows Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, and earnestly implements Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. It believes in the masses, relies on the masses, respects the masses' pioneering spirit, and always directs the struggle against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, represented by China's Khrushchev. It is willing to shed blood and sacrifice lives to protect the proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary masses, and steadfastly executes and defends Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Now, through the joint efforts of the entire military and civilian population, revolutionary committees have been established in most parts of the country. This is a great achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and an important sign of its decisive victory. Implementing the revolutionary committees formed by the three-in-one combination is a battle command center leading the broad revolutionary masses to achieve new victories. Consolidating and developing the revolutionary committees is in the fundamental interests of the entire people, is the overall situation of the revolution, and is a key issue in achieving the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is the common responsibility of the entire people and a major political task facing the People's Liberation Army.

The People's Liberation Army must take the path of supporting the government, firmly become the strong backing of the revolutionary committees at all levels. It must use its model actions to trust, respect, support, help, and protect the revolutionary committees, and guide the broad revolutionary masses to cherish and strengthen their proletarian power organs.

Establishing, consolidating, and developing the new revolutionary committees is a serious class struggle. The enemies of the proletariat will always try to sabotage the new revolutionary committees from the right or ultra-left, sabotage the unity between the revolutionary committees and the People's Liberation Army, sabotage the unity between the revolutionary committees and the broad revolutionary masses, and sabotage the unity within the revolutionary committees, attempting to salvage their doomed fate. The comrades of the People's Liberation Army must, together with the people, and together with the revolutionary cadres, keep their eyes open, closely watch the new moves of the class enemies, thoroughly expose and smash the various tricks and schemes of the class enemies, and consolidate and develop the revolutionary committees in the class struggle, defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

The most fundamental thing in consolidating and developing the revolutionary committees is to, as Chairman Mao teaches, "organize a revolutionary leadership corps that is connected with the masses." The People's Liberation Army, armed with Mao Zedong Thought and closely connected with the people, has a great responsibility in building such a leadership corps.

The glorious tradition of the People's Liberation Army is the glorious tradition of our Party and a precious asset of the entire people. The communist thoughts personally cultivated by Chairman Mao, the advanced institutions and fine styles of the proletariat personally created by Chairman Mao, many of which were first developed in the People's Liberation Army. The "three supports, two militaries" personnel and the military representatives in the revolutionary committees at all levels must bring Chairman Mao's proletarian military thought, the principles and policies proposed by Vice Chairman Lin Biao—actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, emphasizing proletarian politics, insisting on the four firsts, promoting the three-eighths style, developing the three democracies, and carrying out the four-good platoon movement—into the revolutionary committees, and apply them to the construction of power. Thoroughly criticize China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line on the issue of power, overcome the influence of old habits in people's minds, and help the revolutionary committees achieve thought revolutionization and organizational revolutionization.

The people are the source of power for the revolutionary regime. The People's Liberation Army must always maintain a close connection with the people, believe in and rely on the broad masses, and wholeheartedly serve the people as good sons and daughters of the people. It must do a good job in propaganda and education among the masses, put studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the first place in all work, universally establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes, strictly distinguish between the two types of contradictions, be ruthless to the enemy and lenient to ourselves, deeply and persistently carry out the great criticism of the revolution, always directing the spearhead against the handful of traitors, spies, diehard capitalist roaders, and unrepentant landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists represented by China's Khrushchev. It must do patient and meticulous ideological and political work among the mass organizations that have made mistakes, even serious mistakes, using Mao Zedong Thought, truly achieving "uniting the broad masses of the people, the more the better." Unite millions of revolutionary masses around the proletarian headquarters with Chairman Mao at the core and Vice Chairman Lin Biao as the deputy, and our proletarian regime will be an unbreakable iron wall.

The broad cadres and military representatives in the revolutionary committees on the "three supports, two militaries" front must better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and be models of revolutionary connection with the masses. They must be humble and prudent, guard against arrogance and impatience, adopt the Marxist dialectical analysis method towards their work, maintain a clear mind in the face of victory and praise, not relax their fighting will, not lose their political direction. They must correctly treat the masses, protect the broad masses of the people, especially pay attention to uniting those who have different opinions from themselves. They must continue to seriously learn from the working class and the broad revolutionary masses, always be students of the masses. They must insist on the mass line of from the masses to the masses, respect collective leadership, observe democratic centralism, and be models of executing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

The step-by-step victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country and the continuous strengthening of the dictatorship of the proletariat have dealt heavy blows to imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries. They will not be reconciled. All the cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army must strengthen their preparedness and be fully alert to the sabotage, subversion, and invasion of the class enemies abroad against our proletarian regime, and "spare no effort to annihilate the invading enemy."

The People's Liberation Army must complete the great historical mission entrusted by Chairman Mao. It must further strengthen the revolutionary construction of the army. "Without a people's army, there is nothing for the people." "The army is the main component of state power." The issue of the army's revolutionization not only determines the nature of the army itself but also directly relates to the fate of state power.

According to the new requirements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the People's Liberation Army must better implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in all aspects of army construction, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, earnestly implement Vice Chairman Lin Biao's principles and policies on political construction of the army, firmly take the path of emphasizing proletarian politics, carry forward glorious traditions, strengthen revolutionary organizational discipline, strengthen unity within the army, and further build the army into one that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and turn the army into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Vice Chairman Lin Biao pointed out: "The work of the troops is complex and varied. As long as we vigorously study and apply Chairman Mao's works, grasp the education of the struggle between the two lines, all problems can be solved." Emphasizing proletarian politics is to emphasize the struggle between Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, to study and apply Chairman Mao's works with the problem of the struggle between the two lines, to criticize and reform oneself, to change one's worldview, and to raise the awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines among the broad cadres and soldiers. Once the awareness of the struggle between the two lines is raised, there will be an intense hatred for the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, and an infinite loyalty to Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The direction will be correct, courage will be found, enthusiasm will be found, creativity will be found, organizational discipline will be found, and the revolutionary spirit of hard work will be found. Our troops will have the greatest combat effectiveness and will be able to create new merits in the struggle to consolidate national defense, defend the dictatorship of the proletariat, and achieve the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Through the great practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the people of the entire country have deepened their proletarian feelings for the People's Liberation Army. The people feel from the bottom of their hearts that with the People's Liberation Army, personally led by our great leader Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin Biao, holding the guns, our country's security is the most reliable guarantee.

The position and role of the People's Liberation Army in the dictatorship of the proletariat are very clear to a handful of class enemies. They want to sabotage the dictatorship of the proletariat and sabotage the new revolutionary committees, always directing their spears at the great People's Liberation Army. The attitude towards the People's Liberation Army is the attitude towards the dictatorship of the proletariat. The proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad masses of the people throughout the country must, at any time, believe in and rely on the People's Liberation Army, support and support the People's Liberation Army. They must further respond to Chairman Mao's great call, "Learn politics, military affairs, the four firsts, the three-eighths style, the three major disciplines and eight items for attention from the PLA, and strengthen organizational discipline." At any time, they must not forget that the People's Liberation Army is the people's own army, and cherish the People's Liberation Army, this great wall, as they cherish their own eyes.

The People's Liberation Army, tempered by the fiery trial of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, has become even stronger. The relationship between the military and the civilians and between the military and the government has never been as close as it is now. Our national defense has never been as solid as it is now.

Let us raise high the great banner of "supporting the army and loving the people," follow Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and strive forward courageously for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

We will definitely liberate Taiwan! We will definitely defeat all domestic and foreign reactionaries!

Victory is always ours!

Long live the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Long live Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

Long live the great People's Liberation Army of China!

Long live the great people of China!

Long live the great, glorious, and correct Chinese Communist Party!

Long live, long live, and ten thousand times long live the great leader Chairman Mao!

　　无产阶级专政的坚强柱石
　　——庆祝中国人民解放军建军四十一周年
　　《人民日报》《红旗》杂志《解放军报》社论
　　在我们夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的时刻，全国军民热烈庆祝伟大统帅毛主席亲自缔造、亲自领导，林彪副主席直接指挥的中国人民解放军建军四十一周年。
　　人民解放军光辉灿烂的历史，是毛主席关于人民战争、人民军队伟大思想胜利的历史，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线胜利的历史，是在伟大领袖毛主席为首的中国共产党领导下建立革命政权、巩固革命政权的历史。
　　几十年来，我们党依靠这支人民军队，打败了国内外的强大敌人，建立了一个伟大的中华人民共和国，保卫着社会主义的江山。今天，我国无产阶级能够发动这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，胜利地进行了防止资本主义复辟、巩固无产阶级专政的伟大斗争，最根本的，是有无产阶级的伟大领袖毛主席的崇高威望和毛泽东思想的无比威力，有用毛泽东思想武装起来的亿万革命人民，同时，也因为有一支高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的，无限忠于党、无限忠于人民、无限忠于毛主席的人民解放军，有这样一个伟大的长城。
　　伟大导师毛主席在我党我军建设的伟大纲领——古田会议决议中教导我们说：“中国的红军是一个执行革命的政治任务的武装集团。特别是现在，红军决不是单纯地打仗的，它除了打仗消灭敌人军事力量之外；还要负担宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众、帮助群众建立革命政权以至于建立共产党的组织等项重大的任务。”
　　革命的根本问题是政权问题。宣传、组织、武装群众，帮助群众建设革命政权，是毛主席一贯的建军思想，是人民解放军的根本任务，是我军从井冈山时期以来的光荣传统。
　　在无产阶级文化大革命中，毛主席发出伟大号召：“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”，指出了军队代表应参加各级革命委员会。人民解放军支持无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资派夺权，军队代表直接参加革命三结合的各级革命委员会，这是加强无产阶级专政的伟大战略措施，是毛主席无产阶级建军思想的重要发展，是毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续革命的伟大理论的重要组成部分，是对马克思列宁主义国家学说的巨大贡献。
　　在毛主席这一光辉思想指引下，中国人民解放军在无产阶级文化大革命中，为保卫无产阶级专政、巩固无产阶级专政作出了新的贡献，建立了丰功伟绩，发挥了无产阶级专政柱石的强大威力。
　　这个军队怀着对毛主席的无限忠诚，满腔热情地宣传毛泽东思想，广泛传播了林彪副主席提出的活学活用毛主席著作、突出无产阶级政治的号召，有力地推动了全国人民活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动。
　　这个军队百倍警惕，英勇作战，守卫着祖国的边防、海防和空防，使我国人民能够在帝、修、反疯狂反华的鼓噪声中，胜利地进行无产阶级文化大革命。
　　这个军队坚决支持左派广大群众，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，认真贯彻毛主席的一系列最新指示，相信群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神，始终把斗争矛头指向以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的党内最大的一小撮走资派，不惜用鲜血和生命保护无产阶级革命派和革命群众，坚定不移地执行和捍卫了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
　　现在，经过全国军民共同奋斗，革命委员会已在全国绝大部份地区建立起来。这是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大成果，是无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的重要标志。
　　实行革命三结合的革命委员会，是带领广大革命群众夺取新的胜利的战斗指挥部。巩固和发展革命委员会，是全国人民的根本利益所在，是革命的大局，是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的一个关键性问题。这是全国人民的共同责任，是人民解放军面临的一项重大政治任务。
　　人民解放军一定要走拥政的道路，坚定地做各级革命委员会的强大后盾。要用自己的模范行动，信任、尊重、支持、帮助、保卫革命委员会，并且引导广大革命群众爱护和加强自己的无产阶级权力机构。
　　建立、巩固和发展新生的革命委员会，是一场严重的阶级斗争。无产阶级的敌人总是千方百计地企图从右的或极“左”的方面破坏新生的革命委员会，破坏革命委员会和人民解放军的团结，破坏革命委员会和广大革命群众的团结，破坏革命委员会内部的团结，妄图挽救他们彻底失败的命运。人民解放军的同志们要和人民群众一起，要和革命干部在一起，擦亮眼睛，密切注视阶级敌人的新动向，彻底揭露和粉碎阶级敌人的种种阴谋诡计，在阶级斗争中巩固和发展革命委员会，保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
　　巩固和发展革命委员会，最根本的，就是要按照毛主席的教导，“组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子”。用毛泽东思想武装起来的、同人民群众血肉相联的中国人民解放军，对建设这样一个领导班子，负有重大的责任。
　　人民解放军的光荣传统，就是我党的光荣传统，是全国人民的宝贵财富。毛主席亲手培育的共产主义的思想，亲自创立的无产阶级的先进制度和优良作风，很多是在人民解放军中首先发展起来的。人民解放军的“三支”“两军”人员和各级革命委员会的军队代表，要把毛主席的无产阶级建军思想，把林彪副主席提出的活学活用毛主席著作，突出无产阶级政治，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风，发扬三大民主，开展四好连队运动等方针原则，带进革命委员会，运用到政权建设中去，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫在政权问题上的反革命修正主义路线，克服遗留在人们头脑中的旧习惯势力的影响，帮助革命委员会实现思想革命化和组织革命化。
　　人民群众是革命政权力量的源泉。人民解放军要始终同人民群众保持血肉的联系，相信和依靠广大群众，全心全意为人民服务，当好人民的子弟兵。要充分做好对群众的宣传教育工作，把活学活用毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位，普遍地办好毛泽东思想学习班，严格区别两类不同性质的矛盾，对敌狠，对己和，深入持久地开展革命大批判，始终把矛头对准以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的一小撮叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派、没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子。要对犯过错误甚至严重错误的群众组织，用毛泽东思想做好耐心细致的思想政治工作，真正做到“团结广大人民，团结得越多越好”。把千百万革命群众团结在以毛主席为首、林彪副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的周围，我们无产阶级的政权就是真正的牢不可破的铜墙铁壁。
　　战斗在“三支”“两军”前线的广大指战员和革命委员会的军队代表，要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，做革命化的联系群众的好样子。一定要谦虚谨慎，戒骄戒躁，对自己的工作采取马克思主义的辩证分析方法，在胜利面前，在赞扬声中，保持清醒的头脑，不松懈战斗意志，不迷失政治方向。一定要正确对待群众，保护广大人民群众，特别注意团结那些和自己有不同意见的人。一定要继续认真地向工人阶级和广大革命群众学习，永远当群众的小学生。一定要坚持从群众中来、到群众中去的群众路线，尊重集体领导，遵守民主集中制，做执行毛主席无产阶级革命路线的模范。
　　我国无产阶级文化大革命的节节胜利，我国无产阶级专政的不断加强，沉重地打击了帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派。他们是不会甘心的。人民解放军的全体指战员必须加强战备，充分警惕国外阶级敌人对我国无产阶级政权的破坏、颠覆和侵略，“全力以赴，务歼入侵之敌”。
　　人民解放军要完成毛主席交给自己的伟大历史使命，必须进一步加强军队的革命化建设。“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”“军队是国家政权的主要成份。”军队的革命化问题，不仅决定着军队本身的性质，而且直接关系到国家政权的命运。
　　根据无产阶级文化大革命新的要求，人民解放军要在军队建设的各个方面更好地贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，坚决执行毛主席的一系列最新指示，认真落实林彪副主席关于政治建军的方针原则，坚定地走突出无产阶级政治的道路，发扬光荣传统，加强革命的组织纪律性，加强军队内部的团结统一，进一步把我军建设成为无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的军队，把我军办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
　　林彪副主席指出：“部队工作千头万绪，只要大力活学活用毛主席著作，抓好两条路线斗争的教育，一切问题就可以迎刃而解。”突出无产阶级政治，就是要突出毛主席无产阶级革命路线对资产阶级反动路线的斗争，就是要带着路线斗争的问题活学活用毛主席著作，斗私、批修，改造世界观，提高广大指战员的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。两条路线斗争的觉悟提高了，对党内一小撮走资派和反革命修正主义路线无比仇恨，对毛主席和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线无限忠诚，方向对了，勇敢也有了，积极性也有了，创造性也有了，组织纪律性也有了，吃苦的革命精神也有了。我们的部队就有了最大的战斗力，就能够在巩固国防、保卫无产阶级专政、夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的斗争中，创立新的功勋。
　　通过无产阶级文化大革命的伟大实践，全国人民大大加深了对人民解放军的无产阶级感情。人民群众从内心里感到，有伟大领袖毛主席亲自领导的、林彪副主席直接指挥的人民解放军，枪杆子掌握在这样一支伟大的人民军队手里，是我们国家安全的最可靠的保障。
　　人民解放军在无产阶级专政中的地位和作用，一小撮阶级敌人是很清楚的。他们要破坏无产阶级专政，破坏新生的革命委员会，总是要把矛头指向伟大的人民解放军。对待人民解放军的态度，就是对待无产阶级专政的态度。全国无产阶级革命派和广大人民群众，任何时候都要相信和依靠人民解放军，拥护和支持人民解放军。要进一步响应毛主席的伟大号召，“向解放军学政治，学军事，学四个第一，学三八作风，学三大纪律八项注意，加强组织纪律性”。任何时候都不要忘记人民解放军是人民自己的军队，象爱护自己的眼睛一样，爱护人民解放军这个伟大的长城。
　　人民解放军经过无产阶级文化大革命烈火的锻炼，变得更加坚强。军民之间和军政之间从来没有象现在这样亲密无间。我们的国防从来没有象现在这样巩固。
　　让我们高举“拥军爱民”的伟大旗帜，沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，向着无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利奋勇前进！
　　我们一定要解放台湾！我们一定能战胜国内外一切反动派！
　　胜利永远是我们的！
　　无产阶级文化大革命胜利万岁！
　　毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！
　　伟大的中国人民解放军万岁！
　　伟大的中国人民万岁！
　　伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党万岁！
　　伟大统帅毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
