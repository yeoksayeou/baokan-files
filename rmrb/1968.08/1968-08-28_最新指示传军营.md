	Latest instructions reach the military camp,
	Qin Ge Dong's joyous news rides the east wind's breeze,
	The golden sun shines red on mountains and rivers,
	Chairman Mao's latest instructions reach the military camp,
	The hearts of the soldiers are especially joyful.

	Gathered under Chairman Mao's portrait,
	Words from the heart pour out of the mouth.
	The Cultural Revolution's victory song rings out,
	The great leader waves his hand,
	The working class leads the way,
	Battle songs echo like spring thunder.

	Chairman Mao's workers will take the lead,
	Striding forward swiftly on the revolutionary path!
	Soldiers joyfully cheer,
	Red hearts pounding, drums beating,
	Forever fighting alongside the workers,
	Steel guns and iron pens display their might.

	The educational revolution sings a new song,
	Throwing revisionism into the garbage heap!
	Each loyal heart faces the red sun,
	Bold oaths ring out clearly:
	Establish a great school of Mao Zedong Thought,
	Seven hundred million people in China all bask in the morning light.

	The soldiers' songs spread across the four seas:
	Long live Chairman Mao, ten thousand times ten thousand!
