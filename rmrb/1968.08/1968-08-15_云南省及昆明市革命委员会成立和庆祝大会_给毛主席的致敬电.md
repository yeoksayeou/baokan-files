Most beloved and respected Great Leader Chairman Mao:

The 23 million heroes of various ethnic groups in Yunnan, fighting on the frontlines of the southwest border of our motherland and supporting Vietnam against American aggression, are filled with revolutionary enthusiasm. We joyfully report to you, the eternal red sun in the hearts of the revolutionary people, that the Revolutionary Committees of Yunnan Province and Kunming City have been gloriously established!

This is another great victory for your brilliant thoughts!

This is another triumphant anthem for your proletarian revolutionary line, resounding through the heavens!

This is another heavy blow to the American imperialists and their modern revisionist accomplices, who are madly expanding their aggression in Southeast Asia, and to all class enemies at home and abroad!

The revolutionary sons and daughters of Yunnan, who are infinitely loyal to you, hold your red book close to their hearts, shouting and singing with boundless joy. In a thousand words and a thousand songs, we express our most beautiful wishes: We wish you, Chairman Mao, the red sun in our hearts, eternal life! Eternal life!

Dear Chairman Mao, on this grand occasion, we deeply miss you. How can we forget the arduous and glorious battles you led us through?

"In the dark night, the red sun does not set over the land of China. For a hundred years, the demons have danced wildly." In the old society, the iron hooves of imperialism, the chains of landlords, local tyrants, and tribal chiefs, and the whips of capitalists made the people of all ethnic groups suffer endless hardships. The waters of the Nu River flow day and night, but they cannot wash away our hatred for the exploiting classes!

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! It was you who showed us the path to liberation. It was you who, at the critical moment of the Chinese nation's life and death, criticized the erroneous leadership of opportunism within the Party and corrected the revolutionary course. It was you who led the Red Army on a long march to Yunnan, spreading the revolutionary fire far and wide, "arousing thousands and tens of thousands of workers and peasants." From then on, the people of Yunnan also took up their guns and spears, following you, marching forward to seek liberation!

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! It was you who, on Tiananmen Square, proclaimed the birth of New China. It was you who sent the Liberation Army to the southwest, shattering the chains that had bound us for a thousand years. Under your great teachings on class struggle and your brilliant national policies, and with the help of our comrades in the Liberation Army, the revolutionary people of all ethnic groups united to fight the enemy, build the border, and defend the motherland.

Dear Chairman Mao, it was you who showed boundless concern for the revolutionary sons and daughters of the border regions, guiding us toward socialism! It was you who, in your comments on the article "A Chaotic Cooperative Society in Western Yunnan Has Been Rectified," issued a great call to "establish cooperatives in backward villages." Your great teachings struck a heavy blow to the capitalist restoration schemes of the Chinese Khrushchev. Inspired by you, we raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and the banners of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, marching forward bravely!

Dear Chairman Mao, you taught us: "The enemy will not disappear on its own. Whether it is the Chinese reactionaries or the American imperialist aggression in China, they will not retreat from the historical stage on their own." The Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Yunnan, such as Yan Hongyan and Zhao Jianmin, a handful of traitors, spies, and unrepentant capitalist roaders, colluded with the remnants of the Kuomintang and the international imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries. Under the pretext of the border's "backwardness" and "special circumstances," they spread the theory of the extinction of class struggle, established independent kingdoms, and madly pushed the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, attempting to restore capitalism and plunge us back into the abyss of suffering.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! It was you who, with genius, summarized the historical experience of the international communist movement, comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism. You proposed the theory, line, principles, and policies of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. You ignited the blazing flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, opening a new era in the international communist movement!

"Bombard the Headquarters," your great order, like a thunderbolt shaking the world, proclaimed the inevitable doom of the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party! Yan Hongyan and Zhao Jianmin and their ilk, sensing their impending doom, openly blocked your great voice, madly pushing the bourgeois reactionary line, attempting to suppress the surging Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. But how can the wings of a few crows block the sun's rays! The revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres of all ethnic groups, infinitely loyal to you, raised high the revolutionary banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries," launching a fierce attack on the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Yunnan!

"All reactionary forces on the verge of extinction will make desperate struggles against the revolutionary forces." A handful of traitors, spies, counter-revolutionaries, and unrepentant capitalist roaders, in a desperate attempt to save their doomed fate, used every means to launch a counterattack against the revolutionary masses, trying to shake the proletarian headquarters led by you and Vice Chairman Lin, attempting to fundamentally negate and sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! In that fiery battle, on that rugged and winding road, how deeply we missed you! It was your invincible great thoughts that always guided our direction of struggle! It was your great teachings and a series of new instructions that made us timely expose the counter-revolutionary ugly faces of the class enemies, guiding us to smash the enemy's repeated arrogant counterattacks, marching from victory to victory!

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! It was you who, at the critical moment of the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, issued the great order: "The People's Liberation Army should support the broad leftist masses." The People's Liberation Army stationed in Yunnan, raising high the great red banner of your brilliant thoughts, firmly following your great strategic deployments, unyieldingly stood on the side of your proletarian revolutionary line. They resolutely supported the revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary cadres, making great contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Yunnan! When the class enemies tried to instigate and manipulate, destroying military-civilian unity, it was your great teachings of "supporting the army and loving the people" that made us timely expose their tricks, firmly defending the great wall!

Dear Chairman Mao, we resolutely follow your series of new instructions, resolutely fight, and finally thoroughly smash the various plots of the class enemies, achieving great unity and the three-in-one combination of revolution, establishing the Revolutionary Committee of Yunnan Province, pushing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Yunnan forward!

"Navigating the vast sea relies on the helmsman, making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." Dear Chairman Mao, reviewing this arduous and glorious battle course, every step forward was thanks to your guidance. We will definitely take Comrade Lin Biao, your close comrade-in-arms, as a shining example, being infinitely loyal to you, to your brilliant thoughts, and to your proletarian revolutionary line! We will definitely fully implement your series of new instructions, taking "criticizing selfishness and revisionism" as the key, running Mao Zedong Thought study classes well, better studying and applying your brilliant thoughts, carrying out ideological revolutionization, letting your brilliant thoughts guide everything, making Yunnan a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Dear Chairman Mao, we will definitely follow your great strategic deployments, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, preventing the class enemies from attempting to split, sabotage, and overthrow the Revolutionary Committee. "The Revolutionary Committee is good." We vow to defend the newly born Revolutionary Committee with our blood and lives, resolutely implementing your series of instructions on establishing the Revolutionary Committee, resolutely taking the path of streamlining administration and personnel, building the Revolutionary Committee into a highly revolutionary command center that forever raises your great red banner, highlights proletarian politics, and closely connects with the masses, letting the iron mountain of the proletariat never change color!

Dear Chairman Mao, you taught us: "Never forget class struggle." Yunnan is on the border, and class struggle is extremely sharp, intense, and complex. We will never forget class struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat, constantly consolidating and developing the great unity and the three-in-one combination of revolution, insisting on unity, insisting on progress, resolutely opposing right opportunism, right splitism, and right capitulationism, thoroughly smashing the rightist reversal wind. We will definitely eliminate interference from the right and ultra-left, achieving revolutionary great unity by system, industry, and class, running the struggle, criticism, and transformation well in our units, deeply and persistently carrying out the great criticism of revolution, thoroughly criticizing the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and their agents in Yunnan, such as Yan Hongyan and Zhao Jianmin, criticizing them deeply and exposing them thoroughly. We will do a good job in cleaning up the class ranks, accurately and resolutely striking a small handful of class enemies, digging out all the hidden traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries, sweeping them into the dustbin of history. We will definitely implement your teachings of "grasp revolution, promote production, work, and preparedness," rectify the Party's organization, strengthen Party building, and seize comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in terms of ideology, politics, economy, and organization!

"Without a people's army, there is nothing for the people." Dear Chairman Mao! We will definitely remember your teachings, even higher raising the great banner of "supporting the army and loving the people," more firmly believing in and relying on the People's Liberation Army, preventing the class enemies from splitting and sabotaging the great wall. Strengthening the awareness of the enemy, heightening revolutionary vigilance, and uniting heart to heart with the Liberation Army, building a solid political border, forging an iron wall. If the enemy dares to invade, we will resolutely, thoroughly, and completely annihilate it!

Dear Chairman Mao, you taught us: "The people who have already achieved revolutionary victory should aid the people who are still struggling for liberation." We will definitely follow your teachings, resolutely supporting the heroic Vietnamese people in their struggle against American aggression for national liberation to the end.

Most, most beloved Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! The 23 million revolutionary sons and daughters of various ethnic groups in Yunnan love you infinitely, believe in you infinitely, admire you infinitely, and are infinitely loyal to you! We wish you, the great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman, the red sun in our hearts, eternal life! Eternal life! Eternal life!

　　云南省及昆明市革命委员会成立和庆祝大会
　　给毛主席的致敬电
　　最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席：
    战斗在祖国西南边疆、援越抗美前哨的云南两千三百万各族英雄儿女，满怀革命豪情，向您，革命人民心中永远不落的红太阳，报告又一个振奋人心的喜讯：云南省和昆明市革命委员会光荣地诞生了！
    这是您光辉思想的又一伟大胜利！
    这是您的无产阶级革命路线的又一曲响彻云霄的凯歌！
    这是对正在东南亚疯狂扩大侵略战火的美帝国主义及其帮凶现代修正主义，以及国内外一切阶级敌人的又一沉重打击！
    无限忠于您的云南各族革命儿女，手捧您的红彤彤的宝书，尽情欢呼，纵情歌唱，千言万语，千歌万曲，凝成了最美好的祝愿：敬祝您，我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    敬爱的毛主席啊，在这盛大的节日里，我们多么深深地想念您啊，我们怎能忘记您率领我们跨过的艰难而伟大的战斗历程！
    “长夜难明赤县天，百年魔怪舞翩跹”。在旧社会里帝国主义的铁蹄，地主恶霸、土司头人的锁链，资本家的皮鞭，使各族人民受尽了多少苦难的熬煎。怒江水啊日夜奔流，流不尽我们对剥削阶级的仇与恨！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！是您指出了我们解放斗争的道路。是您，在中华民族生死存亡的关头，清算了党内“左”右倾机会主义的错误领导，拨正了革命的航向。是您，统率红军，万里长征到云南，革命火种播四方，“唤起工农千百万”。从此，云南人民也拿起了刀枪木弩，跟着您，前赴后继求解放！
      毛主席啊，毛主席！是您，在天安门上，宣告了新中国的诞生。是您，派出解放大军进西南，砸碎了我们身上的千年锁链。在您的阶级与阶级斗争的伟大学说和光辉的民族政策指引下，在亲人解放军的帮助下，各族革命人民团结对敌，建设边疆，保卫国防。
      敬爱的毛主席，是您无限关怀边疆的各族革命儿女，给我们指明了社会主义的方向！是您在云南西畴县《一个混乱的合作社整顿好了》一文的按语中，发出了伟大号召，在落后的乡村，“我们应当都去建立合作社”！您的伟大教导，迎头痛击了中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的妄想。我们在您的鼓舞下，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的征途上，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，高举党的社会主义建设总路线、大跃进、人民公社的旗帜，奋勇向前！
    敬爱的毛主席，您教导我们：“敌人是不会自行消灭的。无论是中国的反动派，或是美国帝国主义在中国的侵略势力，都不会自行退出历史舞台。”中国赫鲁晓夫及其在云南的代理人阎红彦、赵健民等一小撮叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派，迎合国际上帝、修、反的需要，长期勾结社会上国民党的残渣余孽，借口边疆“落后”、“特殊”，大肆散布“阶级斗争熄灭”论，大搞独立王国，疯狂地推行反革命修正主义路线，妄图复辟资本主义，把我们重新推下苦难的深渊。
      毛主席啊，毛主席！是您，天才地总结了国际共产主义运动的历史经验，全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，提出了在无产阶级专政条件下继续革命的理论、路线、方针、政策，把无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火点燃，开创了国际共产主义运动的新纪元！
    《炮打司令部》，您的伟大号令，有如万钧雷霆震寰宇，宣告了党内一小撮走资派的必然灭亡！阎红彦、赵健民之流预感到他们末日将临，公然封锁您的伟大声音，疯狂地推行资产阶级反动路线，妄图将轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命运动打下去。但是，几只乌鸦的翅膀，怎能遮住太阳的万丈光芒！无限忠于您的无产阶级革命派和各族革命群众，高举“对反动派造反有理”的革命大旗，向中国赫鲁晓夫及其在云南的代理人发起了猛烈进攻！
    “凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的”。一小撮叛徒、特务、反革命分子和死不悔改的走资派，为了挽救其灭亡的命运，拚命地进行垂死挣扎。他们千方百计向无产阶级革命派进行反攻倒算，妄图动摇以您为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，妄图从根本上否定和破坏无产阶级文化大革命，颠覆无产阶级专政。
      毛主席啊，毛主席！在那如火如荼的战斗里，在那崎岖坎坷的征途上，我们是多么深深地想念您啊！是您战无不胜的伟大思想，永远指引着我们战斗前进的方向！是您的“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续”的伟大教导和一系列最新指示，使我们及时识破了阶级敌人的反革命狰狞嘴脸，引导我们粉碎了敌人一次又一次猖狂反扑，从胜利走向胜利！
      毛主席啊，毛主席！是您，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的关键时刻，发出了“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号令。驻云南的中国人民解放军，高举您光辉思想的伟大红旗，紧跟您的伟大战略部署，坚定不移地站在您的无产阶级革命路线一边，坚决支持无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，在云南无产阶级文化大革命中立下了巨大的功勋！当阶级敌人进行挑拨操纵，破坏军民团结时，是您“拥军爱民”的伟大教导，使我们及时识破他们的鬼蜮伎俩，坚决保卫了伟大的长城！
    敬爱的毛主席，我们坚决遵循您的一系列最新指示，坚决战斗，终于彻底粉碎了阶级敌人的种种阴谋诡计，实现了革命的大联合和革命的三结合，建立了云南省革命委员会，把云南无产阶级文化大革命推向前进！
      “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”敬爱的毛主席，回顾这艰难而伟大的战斗历程，每一步前进都是靠了您的指引。我们一定以您的亲密战友林彪同志为光辉榜样，无限忠于您，忠于您的光辉思想，忠于您的无产阶级革命路线！我们一定要全面落实您的一系列最新指示，以“斗私，批修”为纲，办好毛泽东思想学习班，更好地活学活用您的光辉思想，搞好思想革命化，让您的光辉思想统帅一切，把云南办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校。
      敬爱的毛主席，我们一定紧跟您的伟大战略部署，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，严防阶级敌人妄图分裂、破坏和颠覆革命委员会。“革命委员会好”。我们誓用鲜血和生命保卫新生的革命委员会，坚决贯彻执行您关于建设革命委员会的一系列指示，坚决走精兵简政的道路，把革委会建成永远高举您光辉思想伟大红旗、突出无产阶级政治、密切联系群众的非常革命化的战斗指挥部，让无产阶级的铁打江山，永不变色！
    敬爱的毛主席，您教导我们：“千万不要忘记阶级斗争。”云南地处边疆，阶级斗争极其尖锐、激烈、复杂。我们一定念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，不断巩固和发展革命的大联合和革命的三结合，坚持团结，坚持进步，坚决反对右倾机会主义、右倾分裂主义、右倾投降主义，彻底粉碎右倾翻案妖风。我们一定要排除来自右的和极“左”方面的干扰，实现按系统、按行业、按班级的革命大联合，搞好本单位的斗、批、改，深入地、持久地开展革命的大批判，把党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在云南的代理人阎红彦、赵健民之流批深批透，批倒批臭。我们要做好清理阶级队伍的工作，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人，把暗藏的叛徒、特务、反革命分子，统统挖出来，扫进历史的垃圾堆。我们一定坚决贯彻执行您“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”的教导，整顿党的组织，加强党的建设，从思想上、政治上、经济上、组织上夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
    “没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”敬爱的毛主席！我们一定牢记您的教导，更高地举起“拥军爱民”的伟大旗帜，更加坚定不移地相信和依靠人民解放军，严防阶级敌人分裂和破坏伟大的长城。加强敌情观念，提高革命警惕，和解放军心连心，建立巩固的政治边防，筑起真正的铜墙铁壁。敌人胆敢进犯，就把它坚决、彻底、全部消灭干净！
    敬爱的毛主席，您教导我们：“已经获得革命胜利的人民，应该援助正在争取解放的人民的斗争”。我们一定遵循您的教导，坚决支援正在进行抗美救国斗争的英雄的越南人民战斗到底。
      最最敬爱的毛主席啊，毛主席！云南两千三百万各族革命儿女，对您无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚！我们最最衷心地祝愿您啊，伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手，我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
                云南省及昆明市革命委员会成立和庆祝大会
