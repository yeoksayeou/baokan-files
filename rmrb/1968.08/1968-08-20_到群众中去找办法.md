Seek Solutions Among the Masses

During the process of resuming classes and making revolution, some teachers and students of the Third Middle School in Zhuzhou City, Hunan Province, were influenced by anarchist tendencies and often did not come to school. The vice-chairman of the school revolutionary committee and mass representative, Zhou Zaifu, and other committee members held several meetings but could not come up with an effective solution. At this time, two revolutionary teachers posted a big-character poster suggesting: mobilize the revolutionary teachers and students who are in school to use various methods to widely propagate the great significance of resuming classes and making revolution to the students' parents, and urge the students who have left school to quickly return to school to resume classes and make revolution. Xiaozhou brought this suggestion to the revolutionary committee meeting for discussion, and everyone thought this suggestion was practical. Therefore, they organized the revolutionary teachers and students in school and the stationed PLA soldiers to go to nearby factories and villages to propagate to the students' parents. For students who live far from the school, they wrote letters to their families to urge them. Most of the students' parents listen to Chairman Mao's words and urged their children to return to school.

The students returned to school, but how would the revolutionary committee lead the resumption of classes and make revolution? With the help of the stationed PLA soldiers, the school revolutionary committee studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "In all the practical work of our Party, all correct leadership is necessarily 'from the masses, to the masses.'" Everyone realized that to do a good job in resuming classes and making revolution, they still needed to seek solutions among the masses. They mobilized all the revolutionary teachers and students in the school, and everyone engaged in a great debate. With more people, there were more discussions, and various suggestions were quickly put forward. Xiaozhou and other committee members brought the opinions of all the revolutionary teachers and students in the school to the revolutionary committee for research. According to Chairman Mao's instructions, they decided to accept the opinions of the majority of revolutionary teachers and students and start from the revolutionary criticism to carry out the resumption of classes and make revolution.

The revolutionary teachers and students raised their consciousness and united their hearts. They organized themselves, first conducted an in-depth and detailed investigation and research on the school's history of more than ten years, and then carried out a comprehensive and systematic revolutionary criticism. Through the revolutionary criticism, all the revolutionary teachers and students clarified major issues such as what banner to raise, what path to take, what kind of people to cultivate, and what kind of school to run. Through the revolutionary criticism, the initial plan for how to carry out the educational revolution was put forward. At the same time, many new things appeared in the school, such as inviting workers and peasants to teach, teachers and students preparing lessons together, etc., which were gradually implemented.

    到群众中去找办法
    湖南省株洲市第三中学在复课闹革命过程中，部分师生受无政府主义思潮的影响，常常不到校。校革委会副主任、群众代表周再服和其他委员开了几次委员会也想不出什么有效的办法来。这时，两位革命教师贴出了一张大字报，建议：发动在校的革命师生，采用各种方式向学生家长广泛宣传复课闹革命的伟大意义，动员离校学生迅速返校复课闹革命。小周把这个建议带到革委会的会议上讨论，大家都觉得这个建议切实可行。于是，他们就组织在校的革命师生和驻校解放军一起，分头到附近工厂农村去向学生的家长宣传。有的学生离学校较远，就给他家写信去动员。广大学生的家长最听毛主席的话，纷纷动员自己的子女返校。
    同学们到校了，革委会怎样领导复课闹革命？校革委会在驻校解放军的帮助下，学习了毛主席关于“在我党的一切实际工作中，凡属正确的领导，必须是从群众中来，到群众中去”的教导，大家认识到，要搞好复课闹革命，还得到群众中去找办法。他们向全校革命师生作了动员，大家展开了一场大辩论。人多议论多，各种建议很快提出来了。小周和其他委员把全校革命师生的意见带到革委会来，进行研究。根据毛主席的指示，决定接受大多数革命师生的意见，从革命大批判入手，开展复课闹革命。
    革命师生认识提高了，心齐了。师生们组织起来，首先对建校十多年来的历史作了深入细致的调查研究，然后开展了全面、系统的革命大批判。通过革命大批判，全校革命师生弄清了应该举什么旗，走什么路，培养什么人，办什么样的学校等重大问题。通过革命大批判，如何进行教育革命的初步方案提出来了。同时，学校出现了许多新鲜事物，如请工人农民来上课，教师、学生一同备课等等，都逐渐实行起来。
