Comrades of the Editorial Department:

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our country has 700 million people. The working class is the leading class. We must fully give play to the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in all work. The working class should also, in the course of struggle, constantly raise its political consciousness." Chairman Mao, standing at the highest point and looking the farthest, speaks words that strike at the very core of our hearts. In the work of supporting the left, we deeply feel that: relying on the great thought of Mao Zedong, fully giving play to the leading role of the working class, our work will be invincible.

Last June, we came to the Beijing Foodstuffs General Factory to carry out the task of supporting the left. After entering the factory, we followed the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching that "...the working class has the longest vision, is most selfless and public-spirited, and is most thorough in its revolutionary spirit. The entire history of revolution has proved that without the leadership of the working class, revolution will fail; with the leadership of the working class, revolution will win." We believed in the working class everywhere and relied on the working class at all times, mobilizing the working class to seize back all the power usurped by the class enemy. The workers listen most to Chairman Mao's words and follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments closely. After seizing power, we immediately organized large-scale classes to study the thought of Mao Zedong, carried out a revolutionary great criticism, quickly achieved revolutionary great unity and the three-in-one combination, and established a revolutionary committee.

The working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought not only can lead the great revolution in politics and ideology but also can lead the great revolution in production and technology. This factory imported an ice cream machine from abroad in 1966. Due to the control of the bourgeois reactionary technological "authorities," this machine slept for two whole years without being installed. After the revolutionary committee was established, the workers, with boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, were determined to make this machine serve the people. However, a handful of class enemies looked down upon the working class, saying, "Your workers have low skills," "You rough workers want to install foreign machines?" The workers were extremely indignant upon hearing this. They firmly believed: machines are created by the working class, and the working class must control their destiny. Without the bourgeois reactionary technological "authorities," the earth will still revolve. Five worker comrades bravely took on the task of installing this machine. They did not know foreign languages and could not read the drawings, so they studied Chairman Mao's teaching on "What is work? Work is struggle..." and matched the parts one by one. After only seven days of hard work, they made the ice cream machine, which had been in the hands of the bourgeois reactionary technological "authorities" for a year without success, run. It is these "rough workers" who completed twenty-seven major technological innovation tasks in just five months. They not only seized political power but also seized power in production and technology. The revolution is booming, and production is thriving, causing a small handful of class enemies to suffer a shameful defeat.

We deeply feel that the working class is most loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, listens to Chairman Mao's words the most, and implements Chairman Mao's instructions the most resolutely. They have the most leadership. We are determined to learn better from the working class and resolutely support them in seizing and using power well. We will win a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

### 工人阶级是技术革命的主人

专栏：革命群众来信

    工人阶级是技术革命的主人编辑同志：
    毛主席教导我们：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”毛主席他老人家站得最高，看得最远。他老人家的话句句说在我们的心窝里。在支左工作中，我们深深体会到：靠伟大的毛泽东思想，充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用，我们的工作就无往而不胜。
    去年六月，我们来到北京食品总厂执行支左任务。进厂后，我们遵循伟大领袖毛主席“……工人阶级最有远见，大公无私，最富于革命的彻底性。整个革命历史证明，没有工人阶级的领导，革命就要失败，有了工人阶级的领导，革命就胜利了”的教导，处处相信工人阶级，时时依靠工人阶级，发动工人阶级起来夺回了被阶级敌人窃取的一切大权。工人们最听毛主席的话，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。夺权以后，紧接着大办毛泽东思想学习班，开展革命大批判，很快实现了革命的大联合和三结合，成立了革命委员会。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级，不但能领导好政治思想上的大革命，而且能够领导好生产和技术上的大革命。这个厂在一九六六年从外国进口一台冰棍机，由于资产阶级反动技术“权威”的把持，使这台机器整整睡了两年没有安装。革委会成立后，工人们怀着对毛主席的无限忠诚，决心叫这台机器为人民服务。可是一小撮阶级敌人根本看不起工人阶级，说什么“你们工人水平不高”，“你们这大老粗，还想安装外国机器？”工人们听了无比愤怒，他们坚信：机器是工人阶级制造的，工人阶级一定能掌握它的命运。离了资产阶级反动技术“权威”，地球照样转动。有五位工人同志勇敢地承担了安装这台机器的任务。他们不识外国字，看不懂图纸，就学习毛主席“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争……”的教导，把零件一个个“对号入座”，只经过了七天的奋战，就使这台在资产阶级反动技术“权威”手里安装了一年尚未成功的冰棍机转动了。也就是这些“大老粗”，在短短五个月的时间内完成了二十七个大项目的技术革新任务。他们不但掌握了政治上的大权，而且掌握了生产和技术上的大权。革命搞得轰轰烈烈，生产蒸蒸日上，使一小撮阶级敌人遭到了可耻的失败。
    我们深深感到：工人阶级最忠于伟大领袖毛主席，最听毛主席的话，落实毛主席的指示最坚决，他们最有领导权。我们决心更好地向工人阶级学习，坚决支持他们掌好权，用好权。夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
