The PLA soldiers stationed at the Jiangxi Chemical Fiber Factory have actively assisted the factory's revolutionary committee in mobilizing the masses to take the initiative in the struggle against class enemies and in cleaning up class ranks. They have fully utilized the role of old workers and achieved good results.

After the revolutionary committee of the Jiangxi Chemical Fiber Factory was established, it followed Chairman Mao's teaching to "never forget class struggle" and mobilized the masses to take the initiative in the struggle against class enemies. They exposed a number of traitors, spies, stubborn anti-revolutionaries, and other counter-revolutionaries, achieving great success. At this point, some workers thought that those who needed to be exposed had been exposed, and those who needed to be struggled against had been struggled against, leaving little "oil" to be gained. In this situation, how to guide the masses to deepen the class struggle and further improve the work of cleaning up class ranks became an urgent problem for the revolutionary committee to solve. The PLA soldiers stationed at the factory helped the revolutionary committee to analyze the enemy situation and, in light of the specific circumstances of this factory with a history of more than twenty years, unanimously agreed that to thoroughly expose the cover of class struggle in the factory and dig out the deeply hidden class enemies, it was necessary to fully utilize the role of the old workers in the factory. They said that old workers have been in the factory for a long time and are most familiar with the class struggle situation in the factory. Old workers have suffered the most oppression and exploitation in the old society, hate class enemies the most, and are the most resolute in struggle.

After fully recognizing the important role of old workers in the struggle against the enemy and in cleaning up class ranks, the stationed PLA soldiers, together with the factory's revolutionary committee, organized more than one hundred old workers, both in-service and retired, and, following Chairman Mao's teaching that "holding study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes," established a study class with class struggle as the main content. The old workers were very moved that the revolutionary committee and the stationed PLA soldiers valued them so much. In the study class, they seriously studied Chairman Mao's great teachings: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and its led revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Through the study, they further clarified the great significance of this struggle. At the same time, they carried out activities to recall and compare the past, remembering bitterness and thinking of sweetness, further raising their awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. Some retired old workers said, "Although we have retired, our thoughts cannot retire, and the revolution cannot stop! We resolutely participate in the struggle against the enemy and, together with all revolutionary workers in the factory, dig out all class enemies!" The old workers unanimously expressed: Chairman Mao cares for us, the working class, the most and supports our revolutionary actions the most. We must fully play the role of the main force of the working class and achieve new victories in the struggle.

After the old workers' awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines was raised, they immediately went to various teams to recall bitterness and think of sweetness, using the class bitterness of the old society to arouse the revolutionary workers', especially the young workers', hatred towards class enemies. They also combined this with the criticism of the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" by the Chinese Khrushchev, helping the revolutionary workers to see clearly. Through one session after another of recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness and one session after another of revolutionary criticism, the workers' hatred towards the enemy was deeply aroused, and the atmosphere of struggling against the enemy was thick. Some young workers who originally thought there was little "oil" to be gained and had some slackening of spirit had their awareness of class struggle greatly raised. With a new fighting posture, they joined the old workers in launching the struggle against the enemy, further exposing the cover of class struggle in the factory, and digging out the deeply hidden class enemies one by one. This greatly boosted the morale of the proletariat and thoroughly crushed the arrogance of the class enemies.

Great leader Chairman Mao recently taught: "Our country has a population of seven hundred million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully play the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and in all work. The working class should also continuously raise its political awareness in the struggle." The stationed PLA soldiers and the comrades of the revolutionary committee of the Jiangxi Chemical Fiber Factory have seriously studied this teaching, summarized the experience of the previous stage of utilizing the role of old workers, and decided to press on with victory, further arming all the workers of the factory with Chairman Mao's brilliant instructions, better playing the role of the working class, launching a new high tide of struggle against the enemy, thoroughly doing a good job in cleaning up class ranks, earnestly carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, and seizing the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    江西化学纤维厂革委会在驻厂解放军帮助下
    组织老工人参加对敌斗争
    稳、准、狠地打击阶级敌人
    据新华社南昌二十三日电　驻江西化学纤维厂的解放军支左人员，在开展对敌斗争和清理阶级队伍的工作中，积极帮助厂革委会充分发挥老工人的作用，取得了很好的效果。
    江西化学纤维厂革委会成立后，遵照毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，发动群众向阶级敌人主动进攻，揪出了一些叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派和其他反革命分子，取得了很大的成绩。这时，有的工人认为该揪的都揪了，该斗的都斗了，没有多大
  “油水”了。在这种情况下，怎样引导群众深入开展阶级斗争，进一步搞好清理阶级队伍的工作，是摆在革委会面前急待解决的问题。驻厂解放军支左人员帮助厂革委会研究和分析了敌情，联系到这个有二十多年历史的厂子的具体情况，一致认为，要彻底揭开厂里阶级斗争的盖子，把隐藏很深的阶级敌人挖出来，必须充分发挥本厂老工人的作用。他们说，老工人在工厂时间长，对本厂阶级斗争情况最熟悉。老工人在旧社会受压迫、受剥削最深，对阶级敌人最恨，斗争最坚决。
    充分认识了老工人在对敌斗争和清理阶级队伍中的重要作用以后，驻厂支左人员同厂革委会一道，把一百多名在职和退休的老工人组织了起来，并且遵照毛主席“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的教导，开办了以阶级斗争为主要内容的毛泽东思想学习班。老工人对厂革委会和驻厂解放军支左人员这样重视他们，心情都很激动。他们在学习班里认真学习了毛主席的伟大教导：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”通过学习，他们进一步明确了这场斗争的伟大意义。在这同时，他们还进行了回忆对比、忆苦思甜的活动，进一步提高了阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟。一些退休的老工人说：“我们人退休了，思想不能退休，革命不能停息！我们坚决参加对敌斗争，同全厂革命职工一道，把阶级敌人统统挖出来！”老工人一致表示：毛主席最关心我们工人阶级，最支持我们工人阶级的革命行动，我们一定要充分发挥工人阶级主力军的作用，在斗争中立新功。
    老工人阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟提高以后，马上分赴各个班组去忆苦思甜，用旧社会的阶级苦去激发革命职工，特别是青年工人对阶级敌人的仇恨，并且结合批判中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论，擦亮革命职工的眼睛。通过一场场忆苦思甜大会和一场场革命大批判会，把工人们对敌人的仇恨搞得深深的，把对敌斗争的气氛搞得浓浓的，一些原来认为“油水”不大，有些松劲情绪的青年工人，阶级斗争觉悟大大提高，以新的战斗姿态，同老工人一起投入了对敌斗争，进一步揭开了本厂的阶级斗争盖子，把埋藏得很深的阶级敌人一个个揪了出来。大长了无产阶级的志气，大灭了阶级敌人的威风。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近教导说：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”江西化纤厂的驻厂支左人员和厂革委会的同志，认真学习了这一教导，总结了前一阶段发挥老工人作用的经验，决心乘胜前进，进一步用毛主席的光辉指示武装全厂工人，更好地发挥工人阶级的作用，掀起对敌斗争的新高潮，切实做好清理阶级队伍的工作，认真搞好斗批改，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
