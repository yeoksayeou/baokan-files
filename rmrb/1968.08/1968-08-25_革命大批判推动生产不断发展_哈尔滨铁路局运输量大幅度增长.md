Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," the revolutionary cadres and workers of the Harbin Railway Bureau have been deeply engaged in revolutionary criticism, driving transportation production to continuously develop. The entire bureau's transportation production has shown a thriving and prosperous scene.

Since this year, the various transportation production indicators of this bureau have been rising month by month. Especially after the national railway and transportation conference in May, transportation production has increased significantly. By August, the daily total number of cars loaded in the entire bureau has reached around 3,000, with the highest reaching 3,200. This is a significant increase from the 1,900 cars in January. The turnover time for freight cars has been reduced from 2.8 days in the first quarter to 1.86 days, exceeding the state's planned indicators. The order of train operations has been improving, and the punctuality rate for the departure and operation of passenger and freight trains has remained stable above 95%. On the 4,000-kilometer railway lines under the jurisdiction of the entire bureau, trains loaded with coal, timber, grain, and other key state materials flow ceaselessly, providing powerful support for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the country's socialist construction.

    革命大批判推动生产不断发展
    哈尔滨铁路局运输量大幅度增长
    在毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针指引下，哈尔滨铁路局广大革命职工深入开展革命大批判，推动运输生产不断发展，全局运输生产出现一片蒸蒸日上的大好局面。
    今年以来，这个局的各项运输生产指标逐月上升。特别是五月份全国铁路、交通会议以后，运输生产更是大幅度增长。进入八月份，全局每日总装车数已达三千辆左右，最高达到三千二百辆，比今年一月份的一千九百辆增加了很多。货车周转时间已由第一季度二点八天，压缩到一点八六天，超额完成了国家计划指标。列车运行秩序日益良好，客货车出发、运行正点率始终稳定在百分之九十五以上。在全局管辖的四千公里铁路线上，一列列满载煤炭、木材、粮食等国家重点物资的列车，川流不息，有力地支援了无产阶级文化大革命，支援了国家的社会主义建设。
