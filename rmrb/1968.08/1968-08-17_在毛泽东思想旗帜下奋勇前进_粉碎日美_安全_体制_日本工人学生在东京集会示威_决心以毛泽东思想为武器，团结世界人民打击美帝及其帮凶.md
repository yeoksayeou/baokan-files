Japanese workers and students hold rally and demonstration in Tokyo
Determined to use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, unite with the people of the world to strike at U.S. imperialism and its accomplices

	BEIJING, Aug. 16 (Xinhua) - According to a report from the East Asia News Agency, about 600 Japanese patriotic workers and students held a rally in Tokyo on August 15 to strongly oppose the war policies of U.S. imperialism and the reactionary Sato government, and to support the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries in the world.

	Representatives from the struggle against the expansion of U.S. military facilities in Japan, including those from Sanrizuka and Sunagawa, also participated in the meeting.

	This rally was held to commemorate the 23rd anniversary of Japan's unconditional surrender to the anti-fascist forces of the world.

	The stage of the meeting was adorned with a banner reading, "Marching forward under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought to smash the U.S.-Japan security system!" and a red flag with the words "Long live Mao Zedong Thought!"

	The meeting unanimously adopted a declaration stating: "Chairman Mao Zedong has elevated Marxism-Leninism to a new stage, the stage of Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is the ideological weapon that guarantees the victory of our struggle."

	The declaration said: "The root cause of war lies in imperialism. As long as imperialism exists, war will never disappear from the world. We must not harbor any illusions about U.S. imperialism and all its accomplices. We must use revolutionary violence to smash their counter-revolutionary violence and protect the interests of the people."

	The declaration said that the Japanese monopoly capitalist class, with the support of U.S. imperialism, has been plotting to launch another war of aggression. However, the development of history is contrary to their wishes. We must unite closely with the people of the world and take action to directly strike at U.S. imperialism and its accomplices.

	The declaration warmly praised the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, the great victory of the Vietnamese people's war against U.S. aggression for national salvation, and the courageous struggles of workers and students in France, the United States, and other European countries against their reactionary governments.

	Speakers at the meeting unanimously condemned U.S. imperialism's aggression in Asia and the modern revisionists' role in colluding with U.S. imperialism to invade Asia. They emphasized that to fight against imperialism, one must always arm oneself with Mao Zedong Thought.

	After the meeting, the participants, with a red flag reading "Long live Mao Zedong Thought!" leading the way, marched in a spirited demonstration.

	BEIJING, Aug. 16 (Xinhua) - According to a report from the East Asia News Agency, 500 young workers and students from Okinawa and various parts of Japan bravely held a demonstration in front of the U.S. air base in Kadena, Okinawa, on August 16. They shouted slogans such as, "We will not allow nuclear bases in Okinawa!" and "B-52 bombers, get out of Okinawa!"

	The U.S. military authorities, terrified by this spirited demonstration, sent troops to suppress the demonstrators. Japanese patriotic young workers and students fought fiercely with the U.S. military. The U.S. military arbitrarily arrested a number of demonstrators.

	The U.S. military authorities' direct use of troops to brutally suppress the Japanese people has aroused the extreme indignation of the broad masses of the Japanese people, who are determined to launch a more extensive anti-U.S. patriotic just struggle.

	On August 4, Japanese workers, youth, and students carried a portrait of Chairman Mao, singing "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," and went to participate in a celebration with the crew of a Chinese cargo ship.

    日本工人学生在东京集会示威
    决心以毛泽东思想为武器，团结世界人民打击美帝及其帮凶
    新华社十六日讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本爱国工人和学生约六百人十五日在东京集会，强烈反对美帝和佐藤反动政府的战争政策，支持世界各国人民的革命斗争。
    坚持反对美帝在日本扩建侵略性军事设施的三里塚和砂川农民的代表也参加了大会。
    这次集会是为了纪念日本帝国主义向全世界反法西斯力量无条件投降二十三周年而举行的。
    大会主席台上挂着“在毛泽东思想的旗帜下奋勇前进，粉碎日美安全体制！”的标语和一面写着“毛泽东思想万岁！”的红旗。
    会上一致通过的宣言指出：“毛泽东主席把马克思列宁主义提高到崭新的阶段，即毛泽东思想的阶段。毛泽东思想是保证我们的斗争取得胜利的思想武器。”
    宣言说：“战争的根源在于帝国主义。只要有帝国主义存在，战争就决不会从世界上消失。我们不应对美帝国主义及其一切帮凶抱有任何幻想，我们必须以革命的暴力来粉碎他们的反革命暴力，以保护人民的利益。”
    宣言说，日本垄断资产阶级在美帝的支持下，一直在阴谋再次进行侵略战争。然而历史的发展与他们的意愿背道而驰。我们必须与全世界人民紧紧团结起来，采取行动，给予美帝及其帮凶以直接的打击。
    宣言热烈赞扬中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，热烈赞扬越南人民抗美救国战争的巨大胜利以及法国、美国和欧洲其它国家的工人和学生反对本国反动政府的英勇斗争。
    在大会上讲话的代表们一致谴责美帝国主义在亚洲发动侵略战争，谴责现代修正主义者扮演与美帝勾结侵略亚洲的丑恶角色。他们强调指出，为了同帝国主义进行斗争，必须始终用毛泽东思想武装自己。
    会后，与会者以写着“毛泽东思想万岁！”的红旗为前导，斗志昂扬地举行了示威游行。
    新华社十六日讯　据东方通讯社报道：冲绳和来自日本各地的五百名青年工人和学生十六日在冲绳嘉手纳美国空军基地前面英勇地举行示威，他们高呼：“决不容许在冲绳建立核基地！”“B—52型飞机从冲绳滚出去！”
    美军当局对这次斗志昂扬的示威游行怕得要死，竟然出动军队镇压示威群众。日本爱国青年工人和学生同美军展开了激烈的搏斗。美军无理逮捕了一批示威群众。
    美军当局直接派军队大肆镇压日本人民的暴行，激起了广大日本人民的无比愤怒，他们决心掀起更大规模的反美爱国正义斗争。
