Border and coastal defense soldiers, who day and night guard the front lines to protect Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, to protect our great motherland, and to protect the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, are forever loyal to Chairman Mao. They stand on the front lines, their hearts turned towards Beijing, towards the red sun. On the vast borders of our motherland, they sing a grand song of loyalty with their deeds. The soldiers sing with all their hearts: "Our loyalty to Chairman Mao is like chopping down all the bamboo in the borderlands and dipping our brushes in the vast waters of the Eastern Sea, yet it still cannot be fully expressed or written down!"

Standing on the Snow-Capped Mountains of the Plateau, Forever the Good Sentinels of Chairman Mao

"Standing on the snow-capped mountains of the plateau, everyone's heart is turned towards Beijing. Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, the border defense soldiers miss you."

The soldiers guarding the Pamir Plateau spend years covered in snow and wind, dedicating their hearts to the people. They say: To guard the "Western Gate" of our motherland, we are willing to endure hardship for a lifetime; to guard Chairman Mao, we are willing to stand guard at the border posts of our motherland for a lifetime.

On the eve of National Day last year, just as the people of the entire nation were preparing to celebrate the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the soldiers were ordered to a snow-capped mountain to stand guard. The mountain was shrouded in wind and snow, with temperatures dropping to minus forty or fifty degrees. When the cold pierced their bones, they would lean back-to-back and recite Chairman Mao's teachings over and over again: "In times of difficulty, our comrades must see achievements, see the light, and raise our courage." They held study sessions on applying Chairman Mao's thoughts, discussing Mao Zedong Thought extensively on the snow-capped mountain. The soldiers said: Chairman Mao toils day and night for the people, enduring a little wind and snow on the mountain is nothing. Standing guard for Chairman Mao and for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is our duty; we border defense soldiers braving the wind and snow are the greatest honor. Everyone became more spirited and continued to patrol and stand guard in the heavy snow.

Most border defense soldiers have a special notebook. Whenever they see Chairman Mao's portrait or his latest instructions in newspapers and magazines, they cut them out and paste them in. With deep proletarian feelings, they say: "Seeing Chairman Mao's portrait, a red sun rises in our hearts; hearing Chairman Mao's words, we never lose our way on the path forward." Soldier Chen Guozhen, on a windy and snowy night, opened the door to find the path completely covered in snow. Just as he stepped out, a gust of wind and snow hit him, making him shiver. He thought: "It's so cold!" But then he remembered Chairman Mao's call to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism," immediately picked up his gun, and climbed towards the mountain outpost. He said: "If I take even one step back, it means 'selfishness' has won once, it means I am disloyal to Chairman Mao." He braved the wind and snow and successfully completed his duty.

"The ship sails with the helmsman, the revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." The soldiers of the red border defense units use great Mao Zedong Thought to guide their actions. Every soldier considers standing guard on the Pamir Plateau as the greatest honor of their life. When old soldiers are about to be discharged, before leaving, they consciously stand the last watch, hand over the last shift, attend the last class, and hold the last study session on applying Chairman Mao's works. They carefully inspect every fortification and every outpost. They repeatedly tell those left behind that when new comrades arrive, they must lead them to learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, and achieve merits for the people.

Heart with the Red Sun, Mountains and Rivers Are but Trifles

In the southwest borderlands, the mountains are high and the forests dense.

In a deep valley far from the inland of our motherland, the soldiers of the First Company of a certain unit of the Kunming Army have been patrolling and standing guard for years. This is a high-altitude cold region, with more than half the year covered in snow. The soldiers face all this fearlessly. They say: "Snow can cover the mountains, but it cannot cover our limitless love for Chairman Mao, it cannot cover our enthusiasm for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, it cannot cover our resolute hearts to carry out Chairman Mao's revolutionary line." For seven or eight years, they have persisted in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the borderlands, no matter how difficult the circumstances. Once, a small squad went on patrol, traveling for twelve days and hundreds of miles, finding no people along the way. When it rained heavily and they couldn't start a fire, they ate raw rice; when they couldn't find water, they ate fried rice; when the mountains were steep and they couldn't find a place to sleep, the comrades chopped down tree stumps and nailed them to the ground to block the wind. Everyone stepped on the tree stumps, under the firelight, and continued to study Chairman Mao's works. Sometimes, when they reached marshy areas and couldn't find a dry spot, they would spread out a piece of oilcloth on the wet ground, sit down, and hold a study session on applying Mao Zedong Thought, sharing their experiences of overcoming selfishness and establishing public spirit.

The soldiers not only establish Mao Zedong Thought firmly in their minds and take root and grow in the borderlands with Mao Zedong Thought, but they also, with deep proletarian feelings, enthusiastically help the local Dulong people turn the borderlands into a vast school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Wherever the soldiers go, they use Mao Zedong Thought to arm the masses and vigorously promote the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. Every time Naxi soldier He Lijia goes among the people, he studies Chairman Mao's works with them and teaches them everything he has learned; every time he sings with the people, he sings all the songs of Chairman Mao's quotations he knows. Lisu soldier Heipada spent three days teaching an old man to recognize the five shining golden characters "Serve the People."

Last October, the soldiers heard on the radio Chairman Mao's great call to hold extensive study classes, and they immediately sprang into action with the greatest enthusiasm, working with the Dulong people to hold extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Wherever there were villages and families, they held classes there. They even sent a Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team to help a family eight days' journey from the company's base to hold a Mao Zedong Thought study class.

The soldiers of the First Company vigorously spread Mao Zedong Thought in the borderlands, and the border people's love for the great leader Chairman Mao is even more boundless. The great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought flies high in the borderlands of our motherland! It will forever fly high!

The Mountains of Tanggula Connect, Soldiers' Hearts Connect with Chairman Mao

"The cypress trees are green again, the mountain songs sing in unison, the mountains of Tanggula connect, the soldiers' hearts connect with Chairman Mao."

The soldiers of a certain unit's Fifth Company, with boundless proletarian feelings of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, go south on duty. They encountered a great blizzard on Tanggula Mountain. The soldiers were stranded on the mountain top, where the air is thin and the wind howls, for twelve days and nights.

Tanggula Mountain is white with snow, the wind roars, and the snow still falls endlessly. The harsh natural conditions brought great difficulties to the comrades' lives, and the number of sick soldiers increased day by day.

Tanggula Mountain is white with snow, but the hearts of the revolutionary soldiers are red with fire. The soldiers of the Fifth Company, standing on the mountain top, turn their hearts towards Beijing. They enthusiastically say: "Standing on the mountain top looking towards Beijing, the more we look, the more we feel Chairman Mao's closeness. Struggling bravely on Tanggula, we temper our red hearts in the stormy waves." Under the leadership of the party branch, they held a Mao Zedong Thought study class on the mountain top. The comrades, with "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the guideline, and the three shining examples in the "Three Articles" as their models, facing Beijing, took an oath: Raise the iron pickaxes to dig the snow peaks, build a road to Beijing!

Thinking of Chairman Mao, we are full of strength. Soldier Xie Zhangxin had a severe headache, his hands and face were swollen, and he hadn't eaten for three days. But when he heard the entire company gathering in front of Chairman Mao's portrait taking an oath, he immediately tidied up his clothes and stood with the comrades to pay respects to Chairman Mao. Second Platoon Leader Chen Shengming was weak and sickly, but every night he volunteered to stand two watches. Soldiers Jing Changao, Wang Shirong, and Bai Shenghai, to ensure the comrades' lives, voluntarily went to break the ice and fetch water, fainting several times on the ground, but waking up and continuing the struggle until the comrades had water to drink, showing the revolutionary soldiers' tenacious revolutionary spirit.

In the midst of hard struggle, all the comrades more deeply felt: Studying Chairman Mao's works is more effective than medicine when sick, studying Chairman Mao's teachings is warmer than a fire when cold, and studying Mao Zedong Thought gives us boundless strength when facing difficulties.

Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the Fifth Company, after a hard struggle, finally successfully descended the mountain and continued their transportation mission. The comrades raised their arms and shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!" The resounding slogans echoed through the mountains and valleys.

### 毛主席啊，边防战士永远忠于您！

　　毛主席啊，边防战士永远忠于您！
    从风雪茫茫的边防哨所，到碧波万顷的海防前哨，日日夜夜为保卫毛主席的革命路线，为保卫伟大的祖国，为保卫无产阶级文化大革命站岗放哨的人民解放军边海防战士，无限忠于毛主席。他们人在边疆，心向北京，心向红太阳，在祖国绵延万里的边防线上，用无限忠于毛主席的实际行动，谱写出壮丽的“忠”字凯歌。战士们纵情地歌唱：“我们对毛主席的一片忠诚，就是伐尽边疆千棚竹，蘸尽东海万顷水，也写不完，书不尽！”
　　站在高原雪山顶永做毛主席的好哨兵
    “站在高原雪山顶，人人心向北京城，毛主席啊毛主席，边防战士想念您。”
    守卫在帕米尔高原的战士，成年累月身披风雪，掏尽红心为人民。他们说：为保卫祖国的“西大门”，愿吃一辈子苦；为保卫毛主席，愿在祖国边卡站一辈子岗。
    去年国庆节前夕，正当全国亿万人民准备热烈庆祝无产阶级文化大革命伟大胜利的时候，战士们奉命到一座雪山上执勤。山上风雪弥漫，气温在零下四五十度。冻得骨肉痛的时候，大伙便背靠背，一遍又一遍朗诵毛主席的教导：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”他们举行活学活用毛泽东思想讲用会，在雪山上大讲特讲毛泽东思想。战士们说：毛主席日夜为人民操劳，我们在雪山顶上冒一点风雪算不了啥。为毛主席站好岗，为无产阶级文化大革命站好岗，是我们的职责；我们边防战士吞风咽雪，是最大的光荣。大家更加斗志昂扬，继续在大风雪中巡逻站岗。
    边防战士大都有一本特备的笔记本，见到报刊上有毛主席像和毛主席的最新指示，就随时剪贴起来。大家怀着深厚的无产阶级感情说：“见到毛主席像，心中升起红太阳；听了毛主席的话，前进路上不迷向。”战士陈国贞，在一个风雪交加的夜晚去站岗，开门一看，道路全被大雪盖住了，刚迈步走出门口，迎面扑来一阵风雪，身上打了一个寒战，心想：好冷的天呀！一转念想起毛主席发出的“要斗私，批修”的号召，立即背好枪，朝着雪山的哨位爬去。他说：“如果有一步不坚定，就是让‘私’字占了一次上风，就是对毛主席的不忠。”他披风冒雪，圆满地完成了这次执勤任务。
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”红色边防队的战士们用伟大的毛泽东思想指挥自己的行动。每一个战士都把在帕米尔高原执勤看成是自己一生中的最大光荣。老战士要复员了，他们在离队前，都自觉地站好最后一班岗，交好最后一次班，听好最后一次课，开好最后一次活学活用毛主席著作讲用会，仔细地看看每一座工事、每一个哨位。他们一再告诉留下的同志，新同志来到的时候，要带领他们学好用好毛泽东思想，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，为人民立功勋。
　　心中升起红太阳  万水千山只等闲
    西南边陲，山高林密。
    在一个远离祖国内地的深山谷里，昆明部队某部一连的战士长年累月在这里巡逻执勤。这里是高寒山区，每年有半年以上是大雪封山季节。战士们面对这一切，无所畏惧。他们说：“大雪能封住高山，封不住我们对毛主席的无限热爱，封不住我们活学活用毛泽东思想的热情，封不住我们坚决执行毛主席革命路线的赤胆忠心。”七、八年来，他们在边疆，无论在任何艰难困苦的场合，都坚持活学活用毛泽东思想，做到雷打不动。有一次，一个小分队出去巡逻，活动十二天，行程数百里，所到之处没人烟。下大雨烧不着火，就吃生米；找不到水，就吃炒米；山陡，找不到睡的地方，同志们就砍来树桩钉在地上，把人挡住。大家脚蹬树桩，映着火光，仍然坚持学习毛主席著作。有时到了沼泽地带，找不到一块干的地方，大家就在湿地上垫块油布，坐下来开活学活用毛泽东思想讲用会，畅谈破私立公的体会。
    战士们不仅在自己的头脑里大立毛泽东思想，靠毛泽东思想在边疆扎根生长，而且满怀深厚的无产阶级感情，热情帮助驻地独龙族人民把边疆办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    战士们走到那里，就在那里用毛泽东思想武装群众，大力开展活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动。纳西族战士和立甲每逢到群众中去，和群众一起学习毛主席著作，总要把自己学过的统统教完；和群众一起唱歌，总要把他会唱的毛主席语录歌一首不留地唱完。傈僳族战士黑帕达，用了三天时间，教会一个老阿爸认识了“为人民服务”五个金光闪闪的大字。
    去年十月，战士们从广播里听到毛主席发出大办学习班的伟大号召，他们闻风而动，立即行动起来，以最大的热情，和独龙族人民一起大办毛泽东思想学习班。那里有村寨，那里有人家，就在那里办。就连离连队驻地有八天路程的一户人家，也派出毛泽东思想宣传队帮助她一家人办起了毛泽东思想学习班。
    一连战士在边疆大力传播毛泽东思想，边疆人民对伟大领袖毛主席更加无限热爱，毛泽东思想伟大红旗在祖国边疆高高飘扬！永远飘扬！
　　唐古拉山山连山　战士和毛主席心连心
    “松柏树儿青又青，山歌唱来声连声，唐古拉山山连山，战士和毛主席心连心。”
    长年奔驰在青藏高原的某部五连指战员，满怀对伟大领袖毛主席无限忠诚的无产阶级感情南下执勤。他们在唐古拉山遇到了大风雪。指战员们被困在空气稀薄、风雪怒吼的山顶上，整整十二个昼夜了。
    唐古拉山白雪皑皑，狂风呼啸，大雪还在不停地下着。恶劣的自然条件，给同志们的生活带来了很大的困难，病号一天天增多。
    唐古拉山雪白一片，革命战士心中火红一团。五连战士们，身在雪山顶，心向北京城。他们热情洋溢地说：“站在雪山望北京，越望越觉毛主席亲，艰苦奋战唐古拉，大风浪里炼红心。”他们在党支部的领导下，在雪山顶上办起了毛泽东思想学习班，同志们以“斗私，批修”为纲，以“老三篇”里的三个光辉形象为榜样，面向北京，立下誓言：扬起铁镐挖雪峰，修条公路通北京！
    想起毛主席，浑身是力量。战士谢张信，头痛剧烈，手和脸都肿了，整整三天没有吃饭，可是当他听到全连同志聚集在毛主席像前宣誓时，他立刻整好服装，和同志们一起向毛主席致敬。二排长陈盛明体弱有病，每晚他都抢着站两班岗。战士荆长熬、王世荣、白生海为了保障同志们的生活，主动去破冰打水，几次昏倒在地，醒来后坚持战斗，直到让同志们喝上水，表现了革命战士顽强的革命精神。
    在艰苦奋战中，全连同志更深切地体会到：患病时学习毛主席著作比灵药还灵，寒冷时学习毛主席教导比炉火更暖，困难时学习毛泽东思想浑身力量无穷。
    在毛泽东思想的指引下，五连经过一番艰苦奋斗，终于胜利地下了山，继续执行运输任务。同志们振臂高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”响亮的口号声震荡着千山万岭。
