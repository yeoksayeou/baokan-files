“Navigating the vast seas relies on the helmsman, making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought.” At this moment of achieving comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it is particularly important for us to unite closely around the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, earnestly study and implement the highest directives, and under the command of the proletarian headquarters, unify our understanding, steps, and actions. We must further carry forward Chairman Mao's long-standing advocacy of the unity of theory and practice, extensively study and apply Chairman Mao's philosophical ideas, learn to use the dialectical method of one divides into two, do thorough and detailed ideological work, correctly handle work, handle the masses, handle ourselves, analyze contradictions, and resolve contradictions. Only in this way can we remain humble and cautious, guard against arrogance and impatience, maintain a clear mind, strengthen our revolutionary fighting will, adhere to the correct political direction, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

For this purpose, our newspaper held a symposium, inviting some workers, cadres, and military representatives to discuss their experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's thought of one divides into two. The comrades who participated in the symposium unanimously agreed that Chairman Mao's dialectical method of one divides into two is the most powerful ideological weapon to ensure that we do everything well, and we must master and apply this weapon in revolutionary practice.

See Both the Positive and Negative Aspects

Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: “The law of the unity of opposites is the fundamental law of the universe.” “We must learn to look at problems comprehensively, not only seeing the positive side of things but also seeing their negative side. Under certain conditions, bad things can lead to good results, and good things can also lead to bad results.” To handle work dialectically means to see both the positive and negative aspects, achievements and shortcomings, and according to the law of the unity of opposites, promote the struggle and transformation of contradictions.

Comrade An Ke from the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of the General Logistics Department stationed in Beijing First Light Industry Bureau said: It is inevitable that some shortcomings and errors will occur in work. Having shortcomings and errors is not frightening; what is most frightening is having a metaphysical way of thinking in our minds, not following Chairman Mao's teaching of looking at work dialectically, but looking at problems in a static, isolated, and one-sided way. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our army, under the command of the great leader Chairman Mao and Vice Commander-in-Chief Lin Biao, carried out the tasks of “three supports and two militaries,” achieving great success. However, this is a new task, and it is inevitable that there will be shortcomings. If we do not see these shortcomings, are satisfied with the achievements we have made, become arrogant and complacent, and stop progressing, we will eventually fall behind. On the contrary, those who see both achievements and dare to face shortcomings have the momentum to advance and can continuously achieve new victories.

He compared the situations of two factories under the Beijing First Light Industry Bureau: One factory initially did well in its work. Later, the comrades supporting the left were afraid of making mistakes and losing honor, did not dare to advance, and did not see the backward aspects of the work, resulting in falling behind. In contrast, the Daily Chemical Factory initially had many problems and was relatively backward in its work. Later, the comrades supporting the left there strictly demanded of themselves. They turned shortcomings into a driving force for work, focused on studying Chairman Mao's works, and focused on cleaning up the class ranks. As a result, they later took the lead, and both revolution and production leaped to the forefront.

Comrade Liu Lanchang from the Military Training Team of the Iron and Steel Corps stationed at Beijing Shijingshan Middle School said: Our school has achieved some success in achieving revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination. Visitors to the school kept coming, and in the midst of praise, some comrades in the military training team became complacent, thinking that the great task was accomplished and that they could withdraw their troops and return to camp. The “self” turned into “arrogance” and emerged. The progress of work slowed down. Later, we used the method of one divides into two to examine our work. It turned out that there were still many problems in our work. Previously, we were blindly optimistic and almost lost our direction. Therefore, we sat down with revolutionary teachers and students to criticize and repudiate selfishness and revisionism. From then on, we learned from the lesson, and every time we heard praise, we examined our weak links. In this way, we were able to be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and continuously advance in our work.

Comrades pointed out: To handle work dialectically, we must first analyze the objective situation dialectically. At this moment of achieving comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the situation is very good and getting better. We are full of confidence and advance victoriously. At the same time, we must also see that class struggle is sharp and complex. A handful of class enemies who are unwilling to admit defeat will inevitably struggle desperately, and the old ideas, old styles, and old forces of the exploiting class will set up various obstacles on our path forward. We must maintain a clear mind, use the method of one divides into two to analyze contradictions, and only then can we advance victoriously. In this regard, comrades cited many facts.

Comrade Li Changsheng, a military representative from a certain unit of the Navy stationed at the Dongfanghong Shipbuilding Factory in Shanghai, said: After the revolutionary committee was established in the Dongfanghong Shipbuilding Factory in Shanghai last August, in the midst of the good revolutionary and production situation throughout the factory, we did not overlook the serious problems in some workshops. One workshop was not united internally, and production did not go up. The revolutionary committee and military control commission comrades went down to this workshop and, together with the masses, held Mao Zedong Thought study classes, analyzed the situation, and focused on class struggle, exposing the bad elements. Class struggle, once grasped, works. This workshop quickly became an advanced workshop.

Comrade Xu Jianzhong from the Left Support Office of a certain unit of the Air Force stationed in Xian County, Hebei Province, said: The Sandstone Valley Brigade in Xian County, Hebei Province, is famous for its “thousands of mountains and rivers for one mu of land, creating high yields on green stone slabs,” and is known as the “living Yugong” brigade. It also made great achievements in the Cultural Revolution. However, recently, a few commune members planted fruit tree seedlings in their private plots, causing disputes with the collective over water, fertilizer, and labor. The military comrades supporting agriculture and the brigade revolutionary committee together analyzed this situation and realized that although the Sandstone Valley Brigade is an advanced unit with great achievements, it cannot stand outside the fierce struggle between the two classes and the two roads. The dispute over water, fertilizer, and labor between private plots and the collective is a manifestation of this struggle. It is also the result of a few commune members being influenced by the “three selfs and one package” and “four freedoms” advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev, showing that the “self” in their minds is at work. This is a major issue of whether to follow the socialist road or the capitalist road, and it cannot be taken lightly. If not seriously resolved, it will definitely hinder collective production. Therefore, Mao Zedong Thought study classes were held, and a high tide of revolutionary criticism was launched, raising the commune members' awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, promoting the further development of production.

See the Essence and Grasp the Mainstream

One divides into two, seeing both the positive and negative aspects of things, but it does not mean treating these two aspects equally. Chairman Mao teaches us: “These comrades' method of looking at problems is wrong. They do not look at the essential and mainstream aspects of problems but emphasize non-essential and non-mainstream aspects. It should be pointed out: Non-essential and non-mainstream aspects should not be ignored and must be solved one by one. However, they should not be regarded as the essence and mainstream, leading to confusion in one's direction.” Only by firmly grasping the essence and mainstream of things can we not lose our political direction in a complex situation and keep up with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment.

Comrade Su Wenyan, the workshop instructor of the Beijing Knitting Factory, shared his experiences, lessons, and insights on this issue at the meeting.

He said that due to being poisoned by the revisionist ideas spread by the Chinese Khrushchev, he had many old frameworks in his mind. At the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he did not understand the broad masses of revolutionaries actively responding to Chairman Mao's great call, rising up to rebel against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party led by the Chinese Khrushchev, and rebelling against the capitalist reactionary line. He only saw the secondary aspects of the revolutionary mass organizations and the revolutionary masses, seeing this flaw and that error, not seeing their mainstream: the general direction is correct. During the movement, he was criticized by some people, always thinking that he came from a poor peasant family, loved Chairman Mao, and had always been diligent in his work, not seeing his own errors and shortcomings, and not using a one divides into two perspective to analyze himself. Therefore, the more he thought about it, the more he felt wronged, and he developed resentment.

After the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of the PLA entered the factory, they organized us, workshop cadres, to specially study Chairman Mao's brilliant work “Investigation on the Peasant Movement in Hunan.” We repeatedly compared our attitude towards the mass movement with Chairman Mao's teachings: “Are we leading them from the front? Or are we standing behind them, pointing fingers and criticizing them? Or are we standing against them, opposing them?” The PLA comrades also guided us to recall bitterness and changes, gradually making me realize that I had become more and more detached from the masses after becoming a cadre, and my proletarian class feelings had become weaker and weaker. If this continued, it would be very dangerous! In this way, I changed from feeling wronged to feeling convinced, examined my mistakes. The masses warmly welcomed my change and allowed me to participate in the revolutionary three-in-one leading cadre group.

Comrade Dan Kezhong, a military representative from a certain unit of the Navy stationed at the Sixth Machinery Department, said that Chairman Mao teaches us: “One-sidedness is absolutism in thinking, it is to view problems metaphysically. Our view of our work, affirming everything or negating everything, is one-sidedness.” In dealing with mass organizations, we must also use one divides into two, neither affirming everything because an organization has achieved some success nor negating everything because an organization has made some mistakes. We must not use whether it conforms to “my” views as a standard, favoring one faction, alienating another, supporting one faction, and suppressing another. We can only have one standard, that is, whether it conforms to Mao Zedong Thought. Whatever conforms to Mao Zedong Thought should be affirmed and supported; whatever goes against Mao Zedong Thought should be criticized and opposed. Only in this way can we uphold the principle of proletarian party nature. For example, there is a unit with two factions of mass organizations: one faction rebelled early and had good revolutionary spirit but later made some mistakes; the other faction rebelled late but fought very resolutely after emerging. If we only look at history and not reality, or only look at reality and not history, we may produce the one-sidedness of affirming everything or negating everything. We comprehensively examine history and reality, find the essence and mainstream of things, and also see their development and transformation. The latter faction emerged later, but their revolution is resolute; the former faction, although they made some mistakes, will quickly correct their mistakes as long as we help them recognize their mistakes. Therefore, both factions are revolutionary mass organizations. We helped them see that the mainstream of the other side is revolutionary, and each side made more self-criticism, and united on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought.

Comrade Zhang Xixian, the chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Caochangdi Middle School, said: In our school, there is a class with some bad tendencies and poor order. The teachers had a sense of difficulty. The PLA and the Revolutionary Committee helped this teacher conduct a survey and research, and after analysis, they saw that most of the students in this class were children of poor and lower-middle peasants, their essence was good, and they had many advantages and strengths. The problem was that we did not excavate, support, and encourage the positive factors in them, and did not mobilize their enthusiasm. Some students said: “In the past, we were regarded as a backward class, and no one listened to our opinions.” We changed our work style, did some thorough ideological work, paid attention to listening to their opinions, and did what they proposed as long as it was reasonable. At the same time, we also helped them criticize and overcome the influence of anarchist thoughts. In this way, this class quickly became a better class.

Both a Force for Revolution and an Object of Revolution

Comrades all talked about correctly treating oneself, which is to always remember Vice Chairman Lin's teaching, treating oneself as both a force for revolution and an object of revolution.

To correctly treat oneself, we must first solve the problem of where the achievements in our work come from and to whom the honor belongs. Comrades said: Achievements have countless reasons, all coming from the invincible Mao Zedong Thought; shortcomings of all kinds, the only reason is that we have not seriously studied and implemented Mao Zedong Thought, and in our work, we have deviated from or gone against Chairman Mao's teachings. Therefore, honor can only belong to the great leader Chairman Mao, to the great Mao Zedong Thought, to the Party, and to the people, and it absolutely cannot be taken by ourselves. Otherwise, we will carry a burden, become swollen-headed, and even become swollen all over, getting “edema.”

The military comrades who participated in the symposium all said: Now the prestige of the PLA is very high. In the midst of praise, we must follow the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao: “Humility makes one progress, arrogance makes one fall behind,” and maintain a clear mind.

Comrade Li Changsheng said: After we entered the factory, we did some work. Later, the masses came to the PLA for everything, and we also easily expressed our opinions everywhere, which easily led to problems, and the factory masses also had opinions. Why did this situation arise? It was because we attributed the achievements to ourselves, became arrogant and complacent, and wrongly thought of ourselves as “heroes” standing above the masses. We learned from this lesson and set rules for ourselves: to be good propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought, not judges; to be good fighters defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, not commanders; to first be good students of the masses, and then teachers of the masses.

Comrade Xu Jianzhong said: The comrades of the PLA Xian County Left Support Office humbly learned from the local area, and in the midst of praise, they made more self-criticism. Once, the masses posted two large slogans on the office wall: “Learn from the PLA! Pay tribute to the PLA!” The political commissar in charge of the left support work saw this, thought about it, and felt that this was not a small matter. He immediately called a meeting with the office comrades, and after discussion, replaced them with two other large slogans: “Navigating the vast seas relies on the helmsman, making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought,” and “Achieving new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.” When the masses asked them why they did this, they recited Chairman Mao's quotations: “We should be humble, cautious, guard against arrogance and impatience, and wholeheartedly serve the Chinese people.”

Comrade Chen Yunqi, a young worker and a member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Beijing New China Printing Factory, deeply felt that: Under the command of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, we charged out to rebel against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, to rebel against old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits, and achieved some success. However, we must also use one divides into two to treat ourselves. We must see that there are still many non-proletarian things and many shortcomings in us. Chairman Mao recently taught us: “Our country has 700 million people, and the working class is the leading class. We must fully play the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work. The working class should also continuously improve its political awareness in the struggle.” Achievements will not be lost if not mentioned, but shortcomings will not be changed if not mentioned. We must dare to rebel against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and also dare to rebel against the “self” in our minds. Only then can we be true proletarian revolutionaries.

He said: Revolution and conservatism, mainstream and secondary aspects, will all transform. After seizing power, the leaders of revolutionary mass organizations, if they think they are extraordinary, do not listen to different opinions, and even suppress different opinions, will detach from the masses and become conservative. They are active in responding to the calls of the proletarian headquarters and listening to Chairman Mao's words during the revolution; but if the “self” in their minds swells up, thinking of themselves as “resounding,” raising their tails to the sky, and even setting up factions, what they want is “with me as the center,” even the instructions of the proletarian headquarters are not listened to. Such people must make a firm decision to use Mao Zedong Thought to reform their bourgeois worldview. Otherwise, if erroneous thoughts are allowed to spread freely, they will develop and fall into the mire of detaching from or even opposing the proletarian headquarters.

    毛主席的一分为二的革命辩证法是做好一切工作的强大思想武器
    ——本报邀请部分工人、干部、解放军代表座谈纪要
      “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”。在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的时刻，特别需要我们紧紧地团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的周围，认真学习和贯彻最高指示，在无产阶级司令部的号令下，统一认识，统一步伐，统一行动。我们必须进一步发扬毛主席历来倡导的理论和实践一致的作风，大学大用毛主席的哲学思想，学会运用一分为二的辩证分析方法，做好深入细致的思想工作，正确地对待工作，对待群众，对待自己，分析矛盾，解决矛盾。只有这样，才能谦虚谨慎，戒骄戒躁，保持清醒的头脑，增强革命的战斗意志，坚持正确的政治方向，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    为此，本报召开座谈会，邀请部分工人、干部、解放军支左人员畅谈学习、运用毛主席一分为二思想的体会。参加座谈会的同志一致认为，毛主席的一分为二的革命辩证法，是保证我们做好一切工作的最强大的思想武器，我们一定要在革命实践中学会掌握运用这个武器。
      既要看到正面　又要看到反面
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“对立统一规律是宇宙的根本规律。”“我们必须学会全面地看问题，不但要看到事物的正面，也要看到它的反面。在一定的条件下，坏的东西可以引出好的结果，好的东西也可以引出坏的结果。”一分为二地对待工作，就是要看到事物的正面和反面、成绩和缺点。并且按照对立统一的规律，促使矛盾的斗争和转化。
    总后勤部驻北京第一轻工业局毛泽东思想宣传队安克同志说：工作中产生一些缺点错误是难免的，有缺点、有错误并不可怕，最可怕的是我们头脑中有形而上学思想方法，不能遵循毛主席所教导的一分为二地看待工作，而是静止地、孤立地、片面地看问题。我们解放军在无产阶级文化大革命中，在伟大统帅毛主席和林彪副统帅的指挥下，执行了“三支”“两军”的任务，取得了很大的成绩。但这是一项新工作，免不了存在缺点。如果我们看不到这些缺点，满足于已有的成绩，就会骄傲自满，裹足不前，最终掉队。相反，凡是既看到成绩，又敢于正视缺点，前进就有了动力，就能不断地立新功。
    他举了北京第一轻工业局所属两个工厂的情况作对比：有一个工厂，开始时工作搞得不错。后来支左的同志做工作总怕出漏子，“有失荣誉”，不敢前进，看不到工作中的落后面，结果掉了队。相反，有个日用品化工厂，开始时问题较多，工作比较落后。后来，在那里支左的同志严格要求自己。他们把缺点变为推动工作的动力，大抓学习毛主席著作，大抓清理阶级队伍。结果后来居上，革命和生产都跃居先进。
    铁道兵驻北京石景山中学军训团刘兰昌同志说：我们学校曾在实现革命大联合和革命三结合方面取得一点成绩。来校访问的人员不断，在一片赞扬声中，军训团有的同志产生了自满情绪，以为大功告成，可以收兵回营。“私”字化为“骄”字冒了出来。工作进展变得慢了。后来我们用一分为二的方法检查自己的工作。真是不查不知道，一查吓一跳。原来我们的工作中还存在不少问题。前一段却因为盲目乐观，几乎迷失了方向。于是我们就同革命师生坐在一起斗私批修。从此，我们接受了教训，以后每听一次赞扬，就查一次薄弱环节。这样，才做到无限忠于毛主席，工作上不断前进。
    同志们指出：要一分为二地对待工作，首先要一分为二地分析客观形势。在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的时刻，形势一片大好，越来越好。我们满怀信心，乘胜前进。同时，也要看到阶级斗争是尖锐复杂的。一小撮不甘心失败的阶级敌人必然要作垂死挣扎，剥削阶级的旧观念、旧作风以及旧的习惯势力还会在我们前进的道路上设置种种障碍。我们务必保持清醒的头脑，运用一分为二的方法，分析矛盾，才能胜利前进。在这方面，同志们举了许多事实。
    海军某部驻上海东方红造船厂军代表李长胜同志说：上海东方红造船厂在去年八月成立革命委员会后，在全厂革命生产形势一片大好声中，我们没有忽视个别车间中的严重问题。有一个车间，内部不团结，生产上不去，革委会和军管会同志下到这个车间，和群众一起办毛泽东思想学习班，分析形势，大抓阶级斗争，揪出了坏人。阶级斗争，一抓就灵。这个车间很快成为先进的车间。
    空军某部驻河北遵化县支左办公室徐建中同志说：河北遵化县沙石峪大队，“万水千山一亩田，青石板上创高产”，是著名的“活愚公”大队。在文化大革命运动中也作出了很大的成绩。但是，不久前，少数社员为在自留地里种果树苗，发生和集体争水、争肥、争劳力的现象。支农的解放军同志和大队革委会一起分析了这种情况，认识到沙石峪大队尽管是先进单位，成绩很大，但是它不能置身于两个阶级、两条道路的剧烈斗争之外。自留地和集体争水、争肥就是这一斗争的体现。也是少数社员头脑中“私”字作怪，受了中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“三自一包”、“四大自由”的流毒影响的结果。这是走社会主义道路还是走资本主义道路的大问题，决不能等闲视之，如不认真解决，一定会妨碍集体生产。于是就大办毛泽东思想学习班，掀起了革命大批判的高潮，提高了社员的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟，促进了生产的进一步大发展。
          看本质　抓主流
    一分为二，既要看到事物的正面，又要看到事物的反面，但决不是将这两方面并列起来，同等看待。毛主席教导我们：“这些同志看问题的方法不对。他们不去看问题的本质方面，主流方面，而是强调那些非本质方面、非主流方面的东西。应当指出：不能忽略非本质方面和非主流方面的问题，必须逐一地将它们解决。但是，不应当将这些看成为本质和主流，以致迷惑了自己的方向。”紧紧地把握事物的本质和主流，才能在错综复杂的情况中，不迷失政治方向，才能跟上毛主席的伟大战略部署。
    北京针织总厂车间指导员苏文元同志在会上畅谈了自己在这方面的经验教训和体会。
    他说，由于中了中国赫鲁晓夫散布的修正主义的毒，自己头脑中旧框框比较多。无产阶级文化大革命一开始，对广大革命群众积极响应毛主席的伟大号召，起来造以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派的反，造资产阶级反动路线的反，很不理解。对于革命的群众组织和革命群众，只是看到了他们的支流，看到这样缺点，那样错误，看不到他们的主流：大方向是正确的。运动中自己受到一些批判，就老是想到我出身贫下中农，是热爱毛主席的，工作中也一直是兢兢业业的，看不到自己的错误和缺点，不能用一分为二的观点来分析自己。因此，越想越不服气，产生了怨气。
    解放军毛泽东思想宣传队进厂以后，组织我们这些车间干部专门学习毛主席的《湖南农民运动考察报告》这篇光辉著作。我们反复对照自己对待群众运动的态度，是“站在他们的前头领导他们呢？还是站在他们的后头指手画脚地批评他们呢？还是站在他们的对面反对他们呢？”解放军同志还引导我们忆苦查变，使我逐渐认识到自己当了干部，越来越脱离群众，无产阶级的阶级感情越来越淡薄，要是再发展下去，非常危险！这样，我从不服气转为服气，检查了自己的错误。群众热情地欢迎我的转变，让我参加了革命三结合的领导班子。
    海军某部驻六机部军代表单可忠同志说，毛主席教导我们：“片面性就是思想上的绝对化，就是形而上学地看问题。对于我们的工作的看法，肯定一切或者否定一切，都是片面性的。”对待群众组织也要一分为二，既不能因为这个组织有过一点成绩而肯定一切，也不能因为那个组织犯过一些错误而否定一切。更不能以是否合“我”的观点为标准，而亲一派、疏一派，支一派、压一派。我们只能有一个标准，就是看你是不是符合毛泽东思想。凡是符合毛泽东思想的，就肯定，就支持；凡是违反毛泽东思想的，就批评，就反对。这样才能坚持无产阶级党性的原则。例如，有个单位存在两派群众组织：一派起来造反早，革命精神好，但是后来犯了一些错误；另一派造反虽迟，但杀出来以后，斗争非常坚决。对这两派如果只看历史，不看现实，或者只看现实，不看历史，就可能产生肯定一切或者否定一切的片面性。我们将历史和现实综合起来考察，找出事物的本质和主流，又看到它的发展和转化。后一派起来较迟，但他们革命是坚决的；前一派虽然犯了一些错误，但只要帮助他们认识错误，他们就会很快地改正错误。因此，这两派都是革命的群众组织。我们就帮助他们相互看到对方的主流是要革命的，各自多做自我批评，在毛泽东思想基础上联合起来。
    北京草场地中学革命委员会主任张希贤同志说：我们学校里有一个班，有些不良倾向，秩序不很好，老师有畏难情绪。解放军和革委会帮助这位老师进行了调查研究，经过分析，看到这一班的学生，大多是贫下中农子弟，本质是好的，他们有好多优点和长处，问题是我们对他们中的积极因素没有去发掘，支持和鼓励不够，没有调动他们的积极性。有些同学就说：“过去我们被人看成是落后的班，有意见也没有人听。”我们改变了工作作风，深入地做了一些思想工作，注意听取他们的意见，凡是他们提出的合理意见，都照着做了。同时，也帮助他们批判克服了无政府主义思想影响。这样，这个班很快地成为较好的班。
    既是革命的动力　又是革命的对象
    同志们都谈到，用一分为二正确地对待自己，这就是要时刻牢记林副主席的教导，把自己既看作是革命的一份力量，又看作是革命的对象。
    要正确地对待自己，首先要解决我们工作中取得的一点成绩从何而来，荣誉应该属于谁的问题。同志们说：成绩千条万条，条条都来自战无不胜的毛泽东思想；缺点这样那样，唯一的原因就是我们没有认真学习、认真贯彻毛泽东思想，工作中脱离或违背了毛主席的教导。所以，荣誉只能归于伟大领袖毛主席，归于伟大的毛泽东思想，归于党，归于人民，绝不能拉在自己身上。不然，就要背上包袱，头脑膨胀，甚至于全身膨胀，得“浮肿病”。
    参加座谈的解放军同志都说：现在解放军的威信很高很高。在一片赞扬声中，我们更要遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导：“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”，保持清醒的头脑。
    李长胜同志说，我们进厂以后，做了一些工作。以后群众事事都来找解放军，我们也就到处轻易表态，这样容易出问题，厂里群众也有意见。为什么会产生这种情况？就是因为把成绩记在自己的账上，产生骄傲自满情绪，错误地认为自己是高踞于群众之上的“英雄”。我们接受了这一教训，为自己规定了：当好毛泽东思想的宣传员，不当裁判员；当好捍卫毛主席革命路线的战斗员，不当司令员；先当好群众的学员，后当群众的教员。
    徐建中同志说：解放军遵化县支左办公室的同志虚心向地方学习，在赞扬声中，多作自我批评。一次，群众在办公室墙上贴了两条大标语：“向解放军学习！向解放军致敬！”负责支左工作的政委看到了，想来想去，觉得这不是一件小事情。连夜找办公室的同志开会，经过讨论，换上了另外两条大标语：“大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”，“在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功”。群众问他们为什么这样做。他们就背诵毛主席语录：“我们应该谦虚，谨慎，戒骄，戒躁，全心全意地为中国人民服务”。
    北京新华印刷厂革命委员会委员、青年工人陈运起同志深有体会地说：我们在以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部号令下冲杀出来，是为了造党内一小撮走资派的反，造旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯的反，做出了一些成绩。但是，我们对自己也要一分为二。要看到我们身上还存在不少非无产阶级的东西，还有不少缺点。毛主席最近教导我们：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”成绩不说丢不了，缺点不说却改不了。我们既要敢于造党内一小撮走资派的反，也要敢于造自己头脑中“私”字的反。这样才算得一个真正的无产阶级革命派。
    他说：革命和保守，主流和支流都会转化。革命群众组织的头头夺权以后，如果自以为了不起，听不进不同意见，甚至压制不同意见，就会脱离群众，走向保守。革命的时候是积极响应无产阶级司令部的号召，听毛主席的话的；但如果头脑里的“我”字膨胀起来，自以为是“响当当”的，把尾巴翘到天上，甚至立山头，搞宗派，什么都要“以我为中心”，连无产阶级司令部的指示也听不进去。这种人必须痛下决心，用毛泽东思想改造自己的资产阶级世界观。不然，让错误思想自由泛滥，发展下去，就会掉进脱离以至对抗无产阶级司令部的泥坑里去。
