	Chairman Mao's Quotations

	Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully bring into play the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in all other work. The working class should also constantly raise its political consciousness in the course of struggle.
