In celebrating the joyous occasion of the birth of the Revolutionary Committee of Yunnan Province and Kunming City, we have received the new battle call from our great leader Chairman Mao: “Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully exert the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in all work. The working class must also, in the course of struggle, constantly raise its political consciousness.” This is the greatest trust, support, encouragement, and spur that our great leader Chairman Mao has given to the working class. It is also the greatest glory and happiness for the working class. Today, the revolutionary workers of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory are filled with enthusiasm, their hearts beating fiercely, and their red hearts facing the red sun. We shout a thousand times, sing a thousand times, celebrating the issuance of the latest instructions from our great leader Chairman Mao, and we sincerely wish our great leader Chairman Mao a long life!

We deeply understand that everything we have comes from the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and from the wise leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. Without the wise leadership of the proletarian headquarters, we cannot talk about the leading role of the working class. The fundamental condition for the working class to play a leading role is to arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, to study and apply Chairman Mao’s works actively, and to truly achieve the unity of learning and application. We must continuously struggle against the reactionary bourgeois “multi-center” theory, overthrow factionalism, individualism, and sectarianism, overcome the bad habit of inconsistency between words and deeds, and oppose all forms of hypocrisy. We must further unite closely on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, unify our understanding, steps, and actions with Mao Zedong Thought. For every instruction from Chairman Mao, for every battle call from the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, we will resolutely execute them. We will execute what we understand and also execute what we do not understand for the time being, deepening our understanding in the process of execution.

Dear Chairman Mao, following your teachings on combining theory with practice, we walk the path you pointed out of “cultivating technical personnel from among the workers.” Under your brilliant guidance, in the fierce struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads, we have overcome the serious interference from the capitalist roaders and the reactionary technical “authorities” of the bourgeoisie, making the workers with practical experience the masters of science and technology. Today, you have shown us the direction and given us boundless strength. Your latest instructions have sentenced to death the counter-revolutionary fallacies of Liu Shaoqi and his agents who deny the working class as the leading class, and have given us the working class a great historical mission.

Chairman Mao’s latest instructions have set higher standards for the working class. We will definitely complete the great historical mission assigned to the working class by Chairman Mao. We will resolutely and unconditionally execute Chairman Mao’s brilliant instructions. In the struggle, we will actively study and apply Chairman Mao’s works, consciously transform our worldview, and constantly raise our political consciousness. We will more fully bring into play the revolutionary pioneering spirit of the working class and the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in all work.

We will, with our actual actions, be absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, absolutely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line, and absolutely loyal to the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. We will implement Chairman Mao’s latest instructions, and with Chairman Mao’s latest instructions as a powerful ideological weapon, we will learn from the People’s Liberation Army, learn from Beijing, find the gaps, catch up with the advanced, and strive to be models in executing the series of latest instructions from the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, models in actively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, models in “supporting the army and loving the people,” and models in “grasping revolution, promoting production, promoting work, and promoting preparedness for war.” We will complete the great historical mission assigned by Chairman Mao and will definitely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

    坚决完成毛主席交给我们的伟大历史使命
    上海机床厂革命委员会
    在欢庆云南省和昆明市革命委员会胜利诞生的大喜日子里，传来了伟大领袖毛主席向我们发出的新的战斗号令：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”这是伟大领袖毛主席对我们工人阶级的最大信任、最大支持、最大鼓舞、最大鞭策。这也是我们工人阶级的最大光荣，最大幸福。今天，我们上海机床厂广大革命职工群情激昂，颗颗红心在激烈地跳动，颗颗红心迎着红太阳。我们千遍欢呼，万遍歌唱，庆祝伟大领袖毛主席最新指示的发表，衷心敬祝我们伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！
    我们深深地懂得，我们一切的一切都来自战无不胜的毛泽东思想，来自以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的英明领导。离开了无产阶级司令部的英明领导，就谈不上发挥工人阶级的领导作用。发挥工人阶级领导作用的根本一条，就是要用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，活学活用毛主席著作，真正做到学用一致。要同反动的资产阶级的“多中心论”不断地展开斗争，打倒山头主义、个人主义和宗派主义，克服言行不一的坏作风，反对一切两面派行为。我们一定要在毛泽东思想的基础上，进一步紧密地团结起来，用毛泽东思想统一认识、统一步伐、统一行动。对毛主席的每一指示，对以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的每一个战斗号令，我们一定坚决执行，理解的要执行，暂时不理解的也要执行，在执行过程中逐步加深理解。
    敬爱的毛主席，我们遵循您关于理论联系实际的教导，走您指出的“从工人中培养技术人员的道路”，在您光辉思想的指引下，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈搏斗中，排除了走资派和资产阶级反动技术“权威”的严重干扰，使有实践经验的工人做了科学技术的主人。今天，您又为我们指明方向，给我们增添了无穷无尽的力量。您的最新指示，宣判了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人否定工人阶级是领导阶级的反革命谬论的死刑，赋予了我们工人阶级伟大的历史使命。
    毛主席的最新指示对我们工人阶级提出了更高要求，我们一定要完成毛主席交给我们工人阶级的伟大历史使命。坚决地不折不扣地执行毛主席的光辉指示，在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，自觉地改造世界观，不断提高政治觉悟。更充分地发挥工人阶级的革命首创精神，发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。
    我们一定以无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席的革命路线、无限忠于以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的实际行动，贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示，并且以毛主席最新指示为强大思想武器，大学解放军，大学北京，大找差距，大赶先进，争做忠实执行以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部一系列最新指示的模范，活学活用毛泽东思想的模范，争做“拥军爱民”的模范和“抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备”的模范，完成毛主席交给我们的伟大历史使命，誓将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
