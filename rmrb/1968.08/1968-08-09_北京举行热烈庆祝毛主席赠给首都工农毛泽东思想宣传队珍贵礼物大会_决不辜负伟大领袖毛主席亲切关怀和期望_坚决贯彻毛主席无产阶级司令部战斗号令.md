	We Will Not Let Down the Great Leader Chairman Mao's Warm Concern and Expectations

	Firmly Carry Out the Combat Orders of Chairman Mao's Proletarian Headquarters

The meeting enthusiastically praised and firmly supported the revolutionary action of the capital's workers and peasants Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams going to universities to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The meeting pointed out that this new-type, revolutionary, and combat-ready workers and peasants propaganda team, with the working class as its main body, is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They have fully demonstrated the role of the main force of the working class and the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the proletarian education revolution.

	New China News Agency, August 8th: On the joyous occasion of the second anniversary of the publication of the great leader Chairman Mao's "Bombard the Headquarters" big-character poster and the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," the capital's workers' congress, peasants' congress, higher education red guards' congress, and middle school red guards' congress, with deep proletarian feelings of infinite loyalty to Chairman Mao, held a "Grand Celebration for Chairman Mao's Precious Gift to the Capital's Workers and Peasants Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams." They joyously shouted that Chairman Mao's gift of precious items to the capital's workers and peasants Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams is the greatest concern, greatest trust, greatest support, and greatest encouragement for us! They firmly declared that they will not let down the great leader's great concern and sincere expectations, closely unite around the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, thoroughly criticize the reactionary bourgeois "multi-center theory," better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and firmly, swiftly, and comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

	Attending today's meeting were responsible comrades from the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee and the Beijing Garrison.

	The meeting was filled with a revolutionary atmosphere from beginning to end. When representatives of the capital's workers and peasants Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams carried a giant portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao and held in both hands the precious gifts sent by Chairman Mao, parading around the venue, the meeting erupted in thunderous applause and cheers. Over 14,000 representatives from various fronts in the capital waved red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and raised their arms, shouting, "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" "Wish Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!"

	At the celebration meeting, representatives from the Beijing Municipal Workers' Congress, Peasants' Congress, Higher Education Red Guards' Congress, and Middle School Red Guards' Congress made a joint speech. Representatives from the capital's workers and peasants Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, and the Beijing Garrison also spoke. They unanimously pointed out that the great leader Chairman Mao's gift of the most precious items to the capital's workers and peasants Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams is not only the greatest concern, greatest trust, and greatest support for the capital's workers and peasants Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, but also the greatest encouragement, greatest concern, greatest education, and greatest spur for the working class and the workers, peasants, and soldiers across the country, the revolutionary red guards, and revolutionary teachers and staff. Chairman Mao cares the most about the people, believes in the people the most, and supports the people's revolutionary actions the most. Chairman Mao is always with us and always with us heart to heart. Chairman Mao is our greatest teacher, most beloved leader, most outstanding commander, and most wise helmsman. They said, in our hearts, the whole Party, the whole army, and the whole country have only one leadership center, and that is the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. We workers, peasants, and soldiers, and revolutionary red guards love the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin the most. We must further strengthen the proletarian concept of unity, thoroughly criticize the reactionary bourgeois "multi-center theory," under the combat orders of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, unify our will, unify our steps, and unify our actions, launch a fierce attack on the handful of traitors, spies, diehard capitalist-roaders, and unrepentant landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists represented by China's Khrushchev, and seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

	The meeting enthusiastically praised and firmly supported the revolutionary action of the capital's workers and peasants Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams going to universities to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The meeting pointed out that this new-type, revolutionary, and combat-ready workers and peasants propaganda team, with the working class as its main body, is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They take the People's Liberation Army as an example, together with the revolutionary red guards and the broad revolutionary teachers and staff, earnestly propagate and implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, fully demonstrating the role of the main force of the working class and the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the proletarian education revolution. We must learn from them well.

	Representatives of the capital's workers and peasants Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams firmly declared at the meeting that they must turn Chairman Mao's greatest concern into boundless spiritual strength, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Chairman Mao's works earnestly, strengthen their own ideological revolutionization, use Mao Zedong Thought to guide every action, and forge themselves into a vanguard that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, follows Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment closely, and firmly implements Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. They will conduct more enthusiastic, detailed, patient, and persistent propaganda work, and fight shoulder to shoulder with the revolutionary red guards and revolutionary teachers and staff of Tsinghua University, earnestly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the education revolution, and turn Tsinghua University into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

	"The unity of the army and the people is as one, see who can match us?" The meeting called on the workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, red guards, and revolutionary teachers and students of the capital to firmly respond to Chairman Mao's great call, humbly and earnestly "learn politics, military affairs, the four firsts, the three-eighths spirit, the three major disciplines and eight points for attention from the People's Liberation Army," unite with the great People's Liberation Army of China, fight together, and win together to seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	The meeting passed a letter of congratulations to the great leader Chairman Mao. The meeting also read a telegram of congratulations from the revolutionary masses and revolutionary factions of Shanghai to the revolutionary factions of the capital and the capital's workers and peasants Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams.
