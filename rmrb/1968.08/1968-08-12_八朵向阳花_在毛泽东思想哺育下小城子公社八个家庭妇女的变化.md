The "Sixteen Articles" Boosted Their Courage

On August 8, 1966, the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Concerning the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution" was issued. It was like a thunderous spring thunder that reached Kangping County, Xiaochengzi Commune, Yaowu Brigade, Xixiang Production Team. The wife of the brigade leader, Zhao Fengge, Wang Shulan, could no longer remain calm. One evening, she gathered seven other household women and discussed the decision of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Everyone spoke enthusiastically, saying that women in the old society were oppressed and ruled by political power, clan power, divine power, and male power, and had suffered enough. After liberation, the Chinese Khrushchev and his ilk still did not regard women highly. Many women lived year after year in the small circle of the family, becoming people who did not care about the socialist revolution. The eight women all felt that the Cultural Revolution had come, and the time for thorough liberation had arrived. Chairman Mao supported us in rebelling against all old forces, and we should listen to Chairman Mao's words, "liberate ourselves." Everyone became more spirited and more excited as they talked. Wang Shulan suddenly stood up and said: "Chairman Mao said, 'The day women of the whole country rise up is the day of the victory of the Chinese revolution.' Chairman Mao values us so much, and we must make him proud. We must break out of the small circle of the family and go out into society to gain experience and carry out the unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution led and initiated by Chairman Mao to the end! As long as we follow Chairman Mao closely and master Mao Zedong Thought, we will fear nothing and overcome any difficulties, creating any miracle in the world!" Wang Shulan's words expressed the common voice of the eight women, giving them immense courage. Under Wang Shulan's initiative, the eight women organized themselves. Thus, the Xiaochengzi Commune, Yaowu Brigade, Xixiang Production Team's eight household women's Mao Zedong Thought study class was formally and bravely born that night.

As soon as the study class began, it marked the start of these eight women's social struggles.

The average age of these eight women was forty-one, with an average of only one year of schooling. Each person had four and a half children and was responsible for the household chores of seven and a half people. Being older, uneducated, having many children, and heavy household chores were already very difficult to overcome, let alone the class enemies who feared their study class would collapse and maliciously mocked and ridiculed them, attacking them spiritually and spreading rumors such as: "Women cannot fight on the battlefield, old women are just messing around with their studies." However, in the face of difficulties, they repeated Chairman Mao's teachings thousands of times: "This army has an indomitable spirit, it will trample all enemies and will never be subdued by the enemy. No matter how difficult and arduous the situation, as long as there is one person, that person must continue to fight." They had only one belief: "We must struggle, we must be liberated, we must advance! Follow Chairman Mao and carry the revolution to the end!" They united closely, worked together, overcame difficulties one by one, stood tall, and marched forward, finally persevering with the study class and making it better and better.

Learning Mao Zedong Thought is the Primary Need

The "Decision of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Concerning the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution" pointed out, "In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and implement proletarian political command. We must carry out the movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works among the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, cadres, and intellectuals, and take Mao Zedong Thought as the action guide for the cultural revolution." These words blew like a spring breeze into the hearts of these eight women. They set the first task of the study class to be mastering Mao Zedong Thought and defending it with their lives! During the Cultural Revolution, they always insisted on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, treating the study of Mao Zedong Thought as the first need in life. They truly carried Chairman Mao's works with them, studying wherever they went. They studied at home, in the class, in the fields, and on the battlefield of criticism and struggle, using Mao Zedong Thought to transform themselves, promote the revolutionization of their thoughts, and guide their thoughts and actions. They said: "Mao Zedong Thought is a revolutionary treasure, without studying it, one cannot live."

The study class leader, Wang Shulan, had many children and was responsible for the household chores of ten people. Although she had many difficulties, she studied the best and became an outstanding activist in studying Mao Zedong Thought. When she recited the brilliant work "In Memory of Norman Bethune," who could calculate how much effort she put in? After finishing a day's heavy household chores, she lay on the kang at night, which was her only good time to study. She called her third daughter to sleep by her side, and the daughter taught her word by word, and she learned word by word. Who knows how many nights she spent, finally reciting the brilliant work "In Memory of Norman Bethune."

The sixty-six-year-old widow, Li Dama, was old and uneducated, relying entirely on her memory to study. In the study class, she was very serious, not returning home if she did not learn something that day, not sleeping if she did not memorize it that night. One day, she learned a quotation from Chairman Mao in the study class and happily walked back home. But when she lay on the kang at night to review, she forgot it again. So she put on her clothes and got off the kang. Her children asked her what she was doing, and she said she had forgotten the quotation from Chairman Mao she learned that day and was going to ask. Her children advised her to ask the next day. She angrily said: "In the old society, our ancestors could not read books, and I am over sixty years old and still cannot recognize a single character. Today, Chairman Mao has given us the conditions to study, and if we do not study well, how can we repay him?" She hobbled with her cane to find her classmate Zhang Shucheng, learned the quotation from Chairman Mao, and then happily walked back home.

Propagating Mao Zedong Thought is the Primary Task

During the process of studying Mao Zedong Thought, these eight household women tasted its sweetness. To help more people master Mao Zedong Thought, the eight of them formed an amateur cultural and entertainment performance team to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. So far, they have rehearsed more than twenty short and powerful programs such as dialogues, singing, and quick-talk. They often perform in homes, fields, farmlands, and streets, closely combining with the current class struggle, and propagating the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. The mother of three children, Shan Shuqin, used to blush when she saw strangers and had rarely left the village in her thirty-one years. She joined the cultural and entertainment performance team and underwent a fierce struggle in her mind. When the performance team was just organized, she felt uncomfortable and unnatural, and always felt difficult when accepting tasks. But when she thought of the suffering her family endured in the old society, she felt that her attitude was wrong. She severely criticized her erroneous thoughts in the study class. From then on, she gradually became an active member of the propaganda performance team. In the fields and on the streets, she led everyone to sing revolutionary songs and dance revolutionary dances. All the programs rehearsed by the performance team, she mastered them all. Once, she accepted a task to perform a dialogue, with very little time, she was afraid of delaying the performance task, even cooking and comforting children while memorizing the lines. At night, after the children slept, she memorized until dawn. The fifty-nine-year-old old woman, Zhang Shuzhen, was a famous propagandist of Mao Zedong Thought. Although her front teeth had fallen out and she spoke with difficulty, she never forgot to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. The Hengdaozi Production Team had a lack of unity between the cadres and the masses, so she actively went to propagate Chairman Mao's latest directive, "Within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interests," and led the criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking a large area and protecting a small clique" by the Chinese Khrushchev. The old woman's high revolutionary will and enthusiasm strongly influenced the Hengdaozi Production Team, promoting unity between the cadres and the masses, and advancing the revolution and production of this production team.

Standing on the Front Line of Revolution and Production

These eight women were not only active in studying and propagating Mao Zedong Thought but also pioneers in following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment to seize the revolution and promote production. They said: "Without Chairman Mao's guidance, we are weak and lost; following Chairman Mao, we are clear-minded and always victorious!"

The mother of four children, Sun Yulan, although her husband went to work outside for a long time, she still managed to find time from her busy schedule to actively participate in the struggle against the enemy and the great criticism. Through investigation and research, she exposed a large number of crimes of a counter-revolutionary in her team who opposed Mao Zedong Thought, sabotaged the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and undermined the collective economy. At the criticism meeting, she said: "After liberation, for more than ten years, the black wind in the countryside has never stopped. This time, I understand that it was the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the countryside who did it. They want to restore the 'paradise' they have lost and dare to oppose our brightest red sun in our hearts. They are truly audacious and presumptuous. My brother and two younger brothers have all joined the People's Liberation Army, using their guns to defend our mountains and rivers. I will fight in the rear like them, picking up the weapon of great criticism and revolution, firing fiercely at the class enemies. Whoever dares to oppose Chairman Mao, dare to attack socialism, dare to be an enemy of the people, we, the revolutionary people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will definitely fight them down and make them stink for eternity, never allowing them to rise again."

The community member, Zhang Shucheng, used to not participate well in collective labor. After joining the study class, her thoughts changed, and she became a labor model in the production team. She said: Mao Zedong Thought teaches us: "To build a great socialist society, it is of great significance to mobilize the broad masses of women to participate in productive activities." We must listen to Chairman Mao's words, seize the revolution, promote production, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and bring glory to Chairman Mao. She said and did, actively going to work, never absent, and became a prominent representative of female labor, earning the title of "production pioneer." This spring, a big wind blew, and the one hundred and five mu of sorghum that the team had just planted had their ridges blown flat, and the seeds were blown out of the soil. Zhang Shucheng and her study class teacher—counselor Li Yan, took the lead in organizing more than twenty women, using human-powered plows, working for five consecutive days, and plowing the more than one hundred mu of sorghum fields, ensuring full germination. Zhang Shucheng's waist ached, and her shoulders were rubbed raw by the ropes, but she never complained.

The military family member, Li Dama, used to have the idea of "self-redness" and, in the study class, severely touched her soul and fought against the "self." In the past, she thought she was old and should rest, not participating in collective labor. In the past two years, she has also thrown herself into the fierce production struggle. This spring, from plowing to late planting, she followed the plow and sowed. She said: "Chairman Mao is so old, but he still works day and night for world revolution. How can we be afraid of hardship and fatigue?" Someone said to her: "Grandma, you are really careful with your planting!" She said: "Planting a good seed is a cannon shot at the Chinese Khrushchev! Planting is a battle, planting is not only an economic battle, but also a political battle. We can only win, not lose!"

The vivid deeds of these eight women in the Xixiang Production Team are just one example of the countless new people and new things that emerged during the Cultural Revolution.

　　八朵向阳花
　　——在毛泽东思想哺育下小城子公社八个家庭妇女的变化
    “十六条”鼓起她们的勇气
    一九六六年八月八日，《中国共产党中央委员会关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》发表了。它象一声惊天的春雷，传到康平县小城子公社要武大队西乡生产队。生产队队长赵凤阁的爱人王淑兰再也不能平静了。一天晚上，她把另外七名家庭妇女找在一块儿，议论起中共中央关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定来。大家你一言我一语，唠得从来没有这样热烈，都说妇女在旧社会受政权、族权、神权、夫权的压迫和统治，受够了罪。解放了，中国赫鲁晓夫之流，还是没把妇女瞧在眼窝子里。使很多妇女成年累月生活在家庭的小圈子里，成了不关心社会主义革命的人。八个人都觉得，文化大革命来了，彻底解放的时候到了。毛主席支持我们造一切旧势力的反，我们应该听毛主席的话，“自己解放自己”。大家越唠越精神，越唠越兴奋，王淑兰忽地站起来，说：“毛主席说‘全国妇女起来之日，就是中国革命胜利之时。’毛主席他老人家对咱们这样看重，咱们就要给他老人家争气。咱们要冲出家庭小圈子，到社会上去长见识，把毛主席领导和发动的这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！只要我们紧跟毛主席，把毛泽东思想学到手，我们就什么也不怕，什么困难都能克服，什么人间奇迹都能创造！”王淑兰的一席话，道出了八个人的共同心声，使大家增添了无比的勇气。在王淑兰的倡议下，八个人组织起来了。于是，西乡生产队八个家庭妇女毛泽东思想学习班便在这天晚上正式勇敢地宣告诞生了。
    学习班一开始，便是这八名妇女社会斗争生活的开始。
    这八名妇女平均年龄四十一岁，读书时间平均只有一年，平均每人带四个半孩子，每人负担七口半人的家务。年纪大，没文化，孩子多，家务重，克服这些困难已经是很不容易的了，何况阶级敌人唯恐她们的学习班不垮，恶毒地挖苦讽刺她们，从精神上向她们进攻，散布什么：“妇女打仗上不去阵，老娘们办学瞎胡混。”但是，在困难面前，她们千遍万遍地重复着毛主席的教导：“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。不论在任何艰难困苦的场合，只要还有一个人，这个人就要继续战斗下去。”她们心中唯有一个信念：“要斗争，要解放，要前进！跟毛主席走，把革命进行到底！”她们紧密团结，同心同德，把困难一个个踩在脚下，挺起腰杆，阔步前进，终于把学习班坚持下来，而且越办越好。
    学习毛泽东思想是第一需要
      《中国共产党中央委员会关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》中指出，“在无产阶级文化大革命中，要高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，实行无产阶级政治挂帅。要在广大工农兵、广大干部和广大知识分子中，开展活学活用毛主席著作的运动，把毛泽东思想作为文化革命的行动指南。”这些话象春风一样，吹到了这八位妇女的心坎上。她们规定学习班的第一个任务，就是要掌握毛泽东思想，誓死捍卫毛泽东思想！在文化大革命运动中，她们始终坚持活学活用毛主席著作，把学习毛泽东思想当作生活的第一需要。她们真正做到了毛主席著作随身带，走到那里就在那里学起来。她们在家庭学，在班上学，在田间学，在大批判战场上学，用毛泽东思想改造自己，促进思想革命化，指导自己的思想和行动。她们说：“毛泽东思想是革命的宝，一天不学活不了。”
    学习班组长王淑兰，孩子多，负担十口人的家务，她的困难虽然很多，但学习最好，成了一个优秀的学习毛泽东思想积极分子。在她背诵《为人民服务》这篇光辉著作的时候，谁能计算出她下了多大功夫？忙完了一天的繁重家务，晚上躺在炕上，这是她学习的唯一最好的时间。她把三女儿叫到自己身边睡，女儿一字一句地教，她一字一句地学。不知用了多少个夜晚，终于把《为人民服务》这篇光辉著作背诵下来了。
    六十六岁的烈属李大娘，年纪大，没文化，学习全靠脑子记。在学习班里，她很认真，当天学不会不回家，不背下来不过夜。一天在学习班里学会了一条毛主席语录，她高兴地走回家去。可是晚上躺在炕上温习的时候，又有些记不清了。于是她穿上衣服，下了地。孩子们问她做什么去，她说白天学的那段毛主席语录又忘了，去问一问。孩子们劝她明日再问。她生气地说：“旧社会咱们家祖祖辈辈念不起书，我活了六十多岁，斗大的字还认不得一口袋。今天毛主席给了咱们学习的条件，咱们不好好学，怎么能对得起他老人家？”她蹒跚地拄着拐杖找到同班的张淑清，学会了那段语录，这才高兴地走回家来。
    宣传毛泽东思想是第一任务
    这八位家庭妇女在学习毛泽东思想的过程中尝到了甜头。为了帮助更多的人掌握毛泽东思想，她们八个人成立了一支宣传毛泽东思想的业余文娱演出队。到目前为止，共排练了对口词、演唱、快板等二十多个短小精悍的节目。经常到各家、田间、地头、街道去演出，紧密配合当前的阶级斗争，宣传战无不胜的毛泽东思想。三个孩子的母亲单淑琴，过去是见了生人就脸红，活了三十一个年头很少走出过村头。她参加文娱演出队，思想上是经过一番激烈斗争的。演出队刚组织起来的时候，她觉得不习惯，不自然，接受任务时总感到很为难。但当她一想起旧社会一家人受的苦，就感到自己的这种态度不对了。她在学习班上狠狠地检查了自己的错误思想。从此以后，她渐渐成了宣传演出队的一个积极分子。在田间、在街上，她带头教大家唱革命歌，跳革命舞。演出队排练的所有节目，她个个精通。有一次接受了一个演出对口词的任务，时间很紧，她怕耽误演出任务，连做饭、哄孩子都在背台词。晚上孩子睡了，一背就是大天亮。五十九岁的老大娘张淑珍，是个有名的毛泽东思想宣传员。她虽然门牙都脱落了，说话很费力，但从未忘记宣传毛泽东思想。横道子生产队干群之间不团结，她就主动跑去宣传毛主席“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突”这条最新指示，带头批判中国赫鲁晓夫“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线。老人高昂的革命意志、饱满的革命热情，强烈地影响了横道子生产队，促进了这里干群之间的团结，推动了这个生产队的革命和生产。
    站在抓革命促生产的第一线
    这八名妇女不但是学习和宣传毛泽东思想的积极分子，而且是紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署抓革命促生产的闯将。她们说：“离开毛主席的教导，少气无力把路迷；紧跟毛主席，心明眼亮永胜利！”
    四个孩子的妈妈孙玉兰，尽管她爱人到外地出工长期不在家，但她想方设法从百忙中挤出时间，积极地参加了对敌斗争和革命大批判。通过调查研究，她揭发了本队一个反革命分子反对毛泽东思想、破坏无产阶级文化大革命、挖集体经济墙脚等大量罪行。在批判会上，她说：“解放以后十几年来，农村的黑风始终没有断，这回我明白了，就是中国赫鲁晓夫和他在农村的代理人搞的鬼。他们妄想恢复已失去的‘天堂’，竟胆敢反对我们心中最红最红的红太阳，真是狗胆包天，自不量力。我的哥哥和两个弟弟都参加了人民解放军，用枪杆子去保卫我们的江山，我在后方要象他们一样进行战斗，拿起革命大批判这个武器，向阶级敌人猛烈开火，谁胆敢反对毛主席，胆敢向社会主义进攻，胆敢与人民为敌，我们用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命人民，就一定把他斗倒斗臭，叫他永世不得翻身。”
    社员张淑清过去参加集体劳动不够好，参加了学习班以后，思想变了，一跃成了生产队的劳动能手。她说：毛主席教导我们：“为了建设伟大的社会主义社会，发动广大的妇女群众参加生产活动，具有极大的意义。”我们要听毛主席的话，抓好革命，促好生产，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，为毛主席他老人家争光。她说到就能做到，积极出工，从不缺勤，是妇女劳力中一个突出的代表，获得了“生产闯将”的称号。今春刮了一场大风，队里刚刚种上的一百零五亩高粱，垄台被风刮平了，种子给吹的露出了土面。张淑清和她们这个学习班的老师——辅导员李岩，带头组织了二十多名妇女，用人拉犁，一连干了五天，把这一百多亩高粱地全趟了一遍，保证了全苗。张淑清的腰累疼了，肩头被绳索磨肿了，可她从未叫过一声苦。
    军属李大娘，过去有自来红的思想，在学习班上，狠触了灵魂，猛斗了“私”字。过去，她认为自己年岁大了，该养养老了，不参加集体劳动，这两年她也投入了火热的生产斗争。今春从开犁到晚田种完，她始终跟犁播种。她说：“毛主席年岁那么大了，还日夜为世界革命大事操劳，咱怎能怕苦怕累呢？”有人跟她说：“大娘，你点种可真认真啊！”她说：“点好一粒种子，就是射向中国赫鲁晓夫的一发炮弹！种地就是战斗，种地不光是打的经济仗，更是打的政治仗，咱们只能打赢，不能打输！”
    西乡生产队这八位妇女的生动事迹，就是在文化大革命中涌现出的千千万万新人新事的一例。
