The PLA representatives in the Revolutionary Committee of Changwu County, Liaoning Province, have been actively helping the new and old cadres to emphasize proletarian politics and striving to build the Revolutionary Committee into a revolutionary and closely connected with the masses leadership group.

	Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 1. The PLA representatives in the Revolutionary Committee of Changwu County, Liaoning Province, have been enthusiastically helping the members of the Revolutionary Committee to emphasize proletarian politics, establish a new revolutionary style, and strive to build the Revolutionary Committee into a revolutionary and closely connected with the masses leadership group, following the direction indicated by Chairman Mao.

	Putting the Study and Application of Mao Zedong Thought First

	The Revolutionary Committee of Changwu County was established in March this year. The PLA representatives, in accordance with Chairman Mao's latest instruction that the Revolutionary Committee should "organize a revolutionary and closely connected with the masses leadership group," have from the very beginning taken it as their fundamental task to help the members of the Revolutionary Committee to emphasize proletarian politics and to insist on using Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle in all work. They said, the most fundamental, most important, and most glorious task of PLA representatives participating in the Revolutionary Committee is to arm themselves and the members of the Revolutionary Committee with Mao Zedong Thought, to lead the masses in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and to make the newly established Revolutionary Committee into a revolutionary and closely connected with the masses leadership group. At the suggestion of the PLA representatives, the first meeting of the County Revolutionary Committee was a study session of Chairman Mao's brilliant works and his latest instructions, and a study of Vice Chairman Lin's instruction that "Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all work of the Party, the army, and the country." Through the study, the committee members received a profound education. They said: "The first meeting was a meeting where the PLA comrades used Mao Zedong Thought to guide us, helping us to clarify the direction of our advance."

	From then on, under the leadership of the PLA representatives, the County Revolutionary Committee has always put the study and application of Chairman Mao's works and his latest instructions in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, earlier than everything, and more important than everything. Whenever Chairman Mao issues a new instruction or the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin issues a command, the Revolutionary Committee studies it seriously and promptly, deeply understands it, and implements it resolutely. On the night when Chairman Mao's latest instruction was issued, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is essentially a great political revolution under the condition of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and its led revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie," the PLA representatives suggested that the Revolutionary Committee hold an emergency meeting to study and implement it. When the command to confer the honorable title of "Gatekeeper" on Comrade Menhe was personally approved by the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin, the PLA representatives suggested that the members of the Revolutionary Committee study it seriously at night and decided to launch a campaign to learn from Comrade Menhe in the entire county, making the "three loyalties" campaign, which is loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, more widespread in the entire county. The committee members reflected: "With the PLA representatives who use Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle participating in the Revolutionary Committee, we will be invincible in the process of revolutionization!"

	Never Forget to Emphasize Proletarian Politics and Grasp Class Struggle

	After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, there were countless tasks to be done. What should be the main focus? The PLA representatives participating in the Revolutionary Committee, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teaching that "we must never forget class struggle," believed that the main focus should be on class struggle, to lead the masses to always direct the spearhead of struggle at the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, such as China's Khrushchev, and their agents, to carry out a thorough criticism and struggle, so that the Revolutionary Committee can be consolidated in the storm of class struggle and become a battle command center with proletarian revolutionary authority. They studied with the members of the Revolutionary Committee Chairman Mao's great teaching that "all revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power," analyzed the new situation, new trends, and new characteristics of class struggle together, and consciously rushed to the front line of class struggle, participated in the battle, and commanded the battle. The entire county quickly launched a new upsurge of mass struggle to expose, criticize, and fight against the enemy, digging out one by one the handful of hidden traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist roaders, and counter-revolutionaries.

	To better lead the struggle against the enemy, the PLA representatives in the Revolutionary Committee also suggested that the Revolutionary Committee promptly summarize and promote the advanced experience of the revolutionary masses. Soon after the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Wangjiadun Production Brigade in Sibuzi Commune took the initiative to launch an attack on the class enemies, and the PLA representatives immediately gave strong support, igniting the fire of struggle against the enemy throughout the county. The revolutionary rebels of Changwu County Agricultural Machinery Factory used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, strictly distinguished between the two different types of contradictions, firmly grasped the direction of the struggle, united all forces that could be united, and accurately and fiercely struck at the handful of class enemies, achieving good experience in the struggle against the enemy. The PLA representatives immediately worked with the members of the Revolutionary Committee to promptly summarize their experience and promote it throughout the county. The members of the Revolutionary Committee said: "Working with the PLA comrades, we can better implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, better grasp and execute policies, and correctly organize and lead the masses to fight against the enemy." The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants said: "The Revolutionary Committee is truly representative of the interests of the masses."

	Bringing the Party's Fine Tradition of Close Ties with the Masses into the Revolutionary Committee

	The PLA representatives participating in the Revolutionary Committee, in accordance with Chairman Mao's great teaching that "the reform of state organs, the most fundamental point, is to be closely connected with the masses," have, with their model actions, led the new and old cadres of the Revolutionary Committee to insist on the mass line. They actively suggested that the Revolutionary Committee mobilize the masses to break down the overlapping administrative organs and take the path of "streamlining and improving efficiency," and guided everyone to start from transforming their worldview, to establish the idea of being closely connected with the masses and serving the people wholeheartedly, so that the newly established Revolutionary Committee can take deep roots among the masses and prevent the growth of weeds of bureaucracy. In the Revolutionary Committee, the military representatives always appear in the role of ordinary laborers and never seek special treatment. They take the lead in speaking at the study and application sessions of Chairman Mao's works, take the lead in speaking at the criticism meetings, and take the lead in exposing their shortcomings and engaging in criticism and self-criticism at the life meetings. Every decision of the Revolutionary Committee and every revolutionary rule and regulation of the organ, they strictly execute them first. On a study day, a PLA representative returned from an out-of-town meeting late at night, but he insisted on participating in the study with his comrades at the organ despite his fatigue. They consciously go deep into the grassroots, maintain close ties with the masses, and do a good job in ideological and political work, humbly accepting the criticism and supervision of the masses. When they hear the masses' criticisms and opinions of the leadership of the Revolutionary Committee, they promptly convey them. In this way, in the Revolutionary Committee, the representatives of revolutionary cadres, mass representatives, and military representatives all take revolutionization and close ties with the masses as the fundamental direction of the construction of the Revolutionary Committee, learn from each other, help each other, and support each other. On the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, the three representatives are tightly united as one, further consolidating and strengthening the Revolutionary Committee.

　　按照毛泽东思想办事　树立崭新的革命作风
    辽宁彰武县革委会的解放军代表，积极帮助新老干部突出无产阶级政治，努力把革委会建设成为革命化的联系群众的领导班子
    新华社沈阳一日电　辽宁省彰武县革命委员会的解放军代表，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，积极热情地帮助革委会的新老干部突出无产阶级政治，树立崭新的革命作风，按照毛主席指引的方向，努力把革命委员会建设成为革命化的联系群众的领导班子。
    把活学活用毛泽东思想放在首位
    彰武县革命委员会今年三月成立。参加“三结合”的军队代表遵照毛主席革命委员会要“组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子”的最新指示，一开始就把帮助革委会成员突出无产阶级政治，坚持在一切工作中用毛泽东思想挂帅，作为自己的根本任务。他们说，解放军代表参加革委会，最根本、最重要、最光荣的任务就是用毛泽东思想武装自己，武装革委会成员，带领群众活学活用毛泽东思想，使新生的革委会成为革命化的密切联系群众的领导班子。在军队代表的提议下，县革委会成立后的第一次会议，就是学习毛主席的光辉著作和毛主席的一系列最新指示，学习林副主席关于“毛泽东思想是全党、全军和全国一切工作的指导方针”的指示。通过学习，使委员们受到了一次深刻的教育。他们说：“第一次会议，是解放军同志用毛泽东思想帮我们定向的会，帮助我们明确了前进的方向。”
    从此，在解放军代表的带动下，县革委会时时处处都把活学活用毛主席著作和毛主席的最新指示，放在高于一切，大于一切，先于一切，重于一切的地位。毛主席每发出一项最新指示，以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部每下达一个命令，革委会都及时认真学习，深刻领会，迅速落实，坚决照办。毛主席的最新指示“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续”发表的当天晚上，解放军代表就建议革委会连夜召开会议学习，研究贯彻。伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席亲自批准，授予门合同志光荣称号的命令一下达，解放军代表就建议革委会成员深夜进行了认真的学习，作出了在全县人民中开展学习门合同志活动的决定，使无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席革命路线的“三忠于”活动，在全县更广泛地开展起来。委员们反映说：“有用毛泽东思想挂帅的解放军代表参加革委会，我们就会在革命化的进程中无往而不胜！”
    念念不忘突出无产阶级政治，狠抓阶级斗争
    革委会成立后，工作千头万绪，主要应当抓什么？参加革委会的解放军代表按照毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，认为主要应当狠抓阶级斗争，要带领群众始终把斗争矛头指向中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮最大的走资派及其代理人，深入开展革命的大批判，使革委会在阶级斗争的风浪中不断巩固，成为有无产阶级革命权威的战斗指挥部。他们和革委会成员一起，学习毛主席关于“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权”的伟大教导，一起分析阶级斗争新形势、新动向、新特点，自觉地奔赴阶级斗争第一线，参加战斗，指挥战斗。全县迅速掀起了一个群众性的大揭发、大批判、大斗争的新高潮，把一小撮暗藏的叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派和反革命分子，一个个地挖了出来。
    为了更好地领导对敌斗争，革委会中的解放军代表，还建议革委会及时总结革命群众的先进经验，予以推广。革委会成立不久，四卜子公社王家店生产队的贫下中农主动向阶级敌人发起进攻，解放军代表立即给予有力支持，在全县点燃了对敌斗争的烈火。彰武县农机厂的无产阶级革命派以毛泽东思想为武器，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，团结一切可以团结的力量，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人，取得了对敌斗争的好经验，解放军代表立即协同革委会成员及时总结了他们的经验，并在全县推广。革委会成员说：“和解放军同志在一起，就能更好地贯彻毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，更好地掌握和执行政策，正确地组织和带领群众向敌人作斗争。”广大贫下中农说：“革委会是真正代表群众利益的。”
    把党的密切联系群众的优良作风带进革委会
    参加革委会的解放军代表遵照毛主席关于“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众”的伟大教导，以自己的模范行动，带动革委会新老干部坚持群众路线。他们积极建议革委会放手发动群众，打破重叠的行政机构，走“精兵简政”的道路，并且引导大家从改造世界观入手，树立密切联系群众，全心全意为人民服务的思想，使新生的革委会牢牢扎根于群众之中，防止官僚主义莠草的滋长。在革委会里，军队代表处处以普通劳动者的身份出现，决不搞特殊。他们在活学活用毛主席著作讲用会上带头讲用，在大批判会上带头发言，在生活会上带头亮私斗私，开展批评和自我批评。革委会的每项决定，机关的每项革命的规章制度，他们都是带头严格执行。在一个学习日里，一位解放军代表去外地开会回来，天色已经很晚，但他不顾疲劳，仍然坚持到机关和同志们一道参加学习。他们时时自觉地深入基层，密切联系群众，大力做好思想政治工作，虚心接受群众的批评监督。听到群众对革委会领导的批评和意见，就及时转达。这样，在革委会中，革命干部代表、群众代表、军队代表都把革命化和联系群众作为革委会建设的根本方向，互相学习，互相帮助，互相支持，在毛泽东思想的基础上，三方面代表拧成一股绳，团结得十分紧密，进一步巩固和加强了革委会。
