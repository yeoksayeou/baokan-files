The advanced collective of the Iron Railway Corps studying Chairman Mao's works, the 13th Company of a certain unit, actively responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production" during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In the task of constructing a technologically precise bridge, they emphasized proletarian politics, raised the class consciousness and two-line struggle consciousness of the officers and soldiers, broke away from old frameworks, mastered new technologies, and achieved double victories in revolutionary construction and construction tasks.

This company had never undertaken a bridge-building task before. This time, the bridge they were responsible for building consisted of more than 2,600 large and small components and 35,000 screws, all of which were assembled in high-altitude operations. The technical precision requirements were extremely strict, with each component and screw connection not allowed to deviate by more than two millimeters. According to the old regulations and the so-called construction experience of capitalist countries, there were a set of rules and regulations. Just for the screw-tightening operation, there were more than 20 regulations, such as only those with a fourth-level technical skill could work on the bridge, those with less than 50 kilograms of arm strength could not participate in the operation, and no technical personnel could supervise the operation, etc. Initially, under the slogan of "only those with technical skills can work on the bridge," only a few technical workers were allowed to work, and no officers or soldiers in the entire company could work on the bridge. They could only push carts, deliver materials, play supporting roles, and do odd jobs. The soldiers, seeing the slow progress of the project, all wanted to work on the bridge. They said, "Such a large bridge, if only a few people work on it coldly and silently, when can we complete the task given to us by Chairman Mao?" After research, the Party branch of the company believed that whether to work on the bridge or not was not a matter of work arrangement, but a big issue of whether to emphasize proletarian politics or technology. The struggle over whether to work on the bridge was essentially a reflection of the struggle between two military thoughts and two military lines on the issue of bridge construction.

Chairman Mao taught us: "The correct political and military lines are not produced and developed naturally and peacefully, but are produced and developed through struggle." The Party branch of this company followed Chairman Mao's teachings, organizing all officers and soldiers in the company to study Chairman Mao's teachings on political military construction and Vice Chairman Lin's instructions on emphasizing proletarian politics, with the question of whether they could work on the bridge. Through the study, everyone further realized that the more technically precise and demanding the task, the more proletarian politics and Mao Zedong Thought should be emphasized. To focus only on technical grades and ignore human factors is a bourgeois military viewpoint. Therefore, the Party branch decided to organize officers and soldiers to work on the bridge.

With the strong will to defend Chairman Mao's military line, all the comrades in the company broke free from the old frameworks and engaged in the technical operations of the bridge construction. In the construction, they placed the study and application of Chairman Mao's works and the thorough ideological transformation of people in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, earlier than everything, and more important than everything. They turned the bridge construction site into a large classroom for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and regarded the bridge-building process as a process of eliminating selfishness and establishing public spirit and transforming the worldview. All the comrades in the company studied, recited, lectured, and applied "Old Three Articles" extensively, consciously igniting a revolution in the depths of their souls, setting ambitious goals, and determining to overcome all difficulties and build the bridge well. Not knowing the technology, they followed Chairman Mao's teachings on learning from war, took old workers as teachers, and learned while working. Many comrades who did not know the component type codes used text to replace them; those who could not read the steel beam structure diagrams took the diagrams to the components and matched them one by one, memorizing them by heart. In just over a week, some soldiers could recite from memory the number of steel components, screws, and connecting plates needed for each of the 82 different types of nodes in the entire bridge without looking at the diagrams. Many old workers said in tears, "Even technical personnel could not do this, but our soldiers did it." After working on the bridge for ten days, they formed an independent working team; in less than a month, many soldiers could undertake work that usually required two years of apprenticeship, and they created an advanced method for the overall hoisting of the bridge, increasing work efficiency by four times. Thus, the construction progress increased from the original five days to build one steel beam to one day to build one steel beam. The screw-tightening operation required high technical standards, so the company selected active members of studying Chairman Mao's works to take on this task. Soldier Liang Xiaojin had never seen such a new technological bridge before, but he studied Chairman Mao's works diligently, had a firm ideology, and regarded participating in the screw-tightening work as a concrete manifestation of defending Chairman Mao's military line. Therefore, he took the work very seriously and meticulously. Once, when tightening a screw in a box-shaped component, the working surface was narrow, and the pneumatic wrench could not be used, so he had to use a socket wrench to tighten it bit by bit. He worked from noon to evening. He used Chairman Mao's teaching of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people as the standard to measure the tightness of the screws, determined to make no difference at all. He exerted all his strength, and when his arms ached, he pressed his body on the wrench and used force to tighten the screw bit by bit until it reached the specified torque.

In the triumphant song of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a new technological bridge designed, manufactured, and constructed by our country was completed. After being appraised by relevant departments, the quality from the foundation to the superstructure was excellent. Practice has proven that people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the bravest, the smartest, and have the greatest combat effectiveness. This company not only built this new technological bridge with Mao Zedong Thought but, more importantly, made all the officers and soldiers in the company more loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. That year, 66% of the new soldiers in the company were rated as five-good soldiers, and the company's political and spiritual outlook underwent a very profound change.

    突出无产阶级政治，建成一座新技术大桥
    铁道兵学习毛主席著作先进集体、某部十三连，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，积极响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，在担负修建一座技术精密度要求很高的大桥任务中，突出无产阶级政治，提高指战员阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟，打破旧框框，掌握新技术，使连队革命化建设和施工任务取得双胜利。
    这个连队从未担负过架桥任务。这次他们担负修建的这座大桥，是由两千六百多根大、小杆件和三万五千多颗螺丝连接组成的，拼装时全是高空作业。技术上的精密度要求非常严格，每根杆件、每颗螺栓连接的误差都不能超过两毫米。按照旧的规章和资本主义国家的所谓施工经验，就有一大套清规戒律和条条框框。仅拧螺栓作业一项，就有二十多条规定，什么没有四级工技术水平不能上桥作业啦，什么臂力不到五十公斤的不能参加作业啦，什么没有技术人员在场监督不能作业啦，等等。起初，在这种“有技术才能上桥”的论调下，只靠少数技术工人干，全连干部、战士没有一个能够上桥作业，只能推车，送料，当配角，打杂工。战士们看着工程进展很慢，纷纷要求上桥作业。他们说，这样大的一座桥，光靠少数人冷冷清清地干，毛主席交给我们的任务啥时才能完成？连党支部经过研究后认为，上桥作业还是打杂工，这不是什么工作安排问题，而是突出无产阶级政治，还是突出技术的大问题。上桥不上桥的斗争，实质上是两种军事思想和两条建军路线斗争在建桥问题上的反映。
    毛主席教导我们：“正确的政治的和军事的路线，不是自然地平安地产生和发展起来的，而是从斗争中产生和发展起来的。”这个连的党支部遵循毛主席的教导，组织全连干部、战士，带着能不能上桥作业的问题，反复学习毛主席有关政治建军的教导和林副主席关于突出无产阶级政治的指示。通过学习，使大家进一步认识到，越是技术精，要求严，越要突出无产阶级政治，突出毛泽东思想。只看技术等级，看不到人的因素，就是资产阶级的单纯军事观点。因此，党支部决定组织干部、战士上桥参加作业。
    全连同志带着捍卫毛主席建军路线的坚强意志，打破旧框框的束缚，投入了建桥工程的技术作业。在施工中，他们把活学活用毛主席著作、狠抓人的思想革命化放在高于一切、大于一切、先于一切、重于一切的位置，把建桥工地办成活学活用毛泽东思想的大课堂，把架桥的过程当作破私立公、改造世界观的过程。全连同志大学、大背、大讲、大用“老三篇”，自觉在灵魂深处爆发革命，树雄心，立壮志，决心战胜一切困难，架好大桥。不懂得技术，他们遵照毛主席关于从战争学习战争的教导，拜老工人为师，边干边学。许多同志不识杆件型号图记，就用文字代替；看不懂钢梁结构图，就把图纸拿到杆件旁一件一件对照，看懂了再用心记下来。只用了一个多星期，有些战士对全桥不同类型的八十二个结点，那个结点需要多少钢件、多少螺栓、多少连接板，不看图纸都能说出来。许多老工人感动地说：“连技术员都做不到的，而我们的战士做到了。”他们上桥十天后，就单独组成了作业工班；不到一个月的时间，许多战士就能担负过去一般需要经过两年学习的艺徒才能担负的工作，并且创造了搭桥整体吊装的先进方法，提高工效四倍。从而使工程进度由原来五天架一节钢梁上升到一天架一节钢梁。拧螺栓作业技术要求严，连里就挑选学习毛主席著作积极分子去担任这个工作。战士梁小金过去从未见过这种新技术大桥，但他刻苦学习毛主席著作，思想过得硬，他把参加拧螺栓的工作，当作捍卫毛主席的建军路线的具体表现。因而高度负责，一丝不苟。一次，拧一颗厢形杆件内的螺栓，工作面窄小，风动扳手施展不开，只好用套筒扳手一点一点地拧。他从中午一直拧到晚上。他以毛主席的“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的教导，作为衡量螺栓松紧程度的标准，决心做到一丝一毫也不差。他使出了全身的力气，手臂拧痛了，就把身子压在扳手上使劲地往下压，使螺栓一丝一毫地往前转动，终于把它拧到了规定的吨位。
    在无产阶级文化大革命的凯歌声中，由我国自己设计、自己制造、自己施工的一座新技术大桥建成了。经有关部门鉴定，从基础到上部建筑，质量优良。实践证明：用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，最勇敢，最聪明，具有最大的战斗力。这个连队，不仅靠毛泽东思想修起了这座新技术大桥，更重要的是使全连干部、战士更加忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席的革命路线。这一年，全连有百分之六十六的新战士被评为五好战士，连队的政治精神面貌发生了极其深刻的变化。
