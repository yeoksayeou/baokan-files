On the occasion of the second anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters" and the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China Concerning the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao presented the precious gift of mangoes, sent by foreign friends, to the Capital Workers and Peasants Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team at Tsinghua University. As soon as this great news spread, the entire Tsinghua Garden became lively. All the revolutionary fighters of our propaganda team enthusiastically cheered, sang joyfully, and were immersed in boundless happiness. Holding the precious gift from Chairman Mao in both hands, gazing at Chairman Mao's portrait, our hearts surged with emotion and tears flowed. Everyone waved the red revolutionary treasure, the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and shouted a thousand times, ten thousand times, "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live forever!"

Chairman Mao's gift to us is the greatest concern, the greatest support, and the greatest encouragement for the Capital Workers and Peasants Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team! This is the greatest concern, the greatest education, and the greatest encouragement for the hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, and soldiers across the country who are united and fighting under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin!

Our great leader Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, the greatest leader of the proletarian revolution. Chairman Mao trusts the masses the most, understands the masses the most, and respects the creative spirit of the revolutionary masses the most. He is always heart-to-heart with us, the working class, and the poor and lower-middle peasants. The Capital Workers and Peasants Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, fighting side by side with the revolutionary Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students at Tsinghua University, has just achieved some results in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Our great leader Chairman Mao presented us with precious gifts, which is the greatest support for us. We will never forget this great event in our lifetime! Indeed, the party's favor is greater than the heavens and the earth, and Chairman Mao is closer to us than our parents!

More than two years of practice in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have made us deeply understand that the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin most concentratedly represents the fundamental interests of the working class, poor and lower-middle peasants, and the broad revolutionary masses. We love the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin the most, and we hate the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev the most. Currently, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is in the midst of achieving comprehensive victory on its great march. The closer the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to comprehensive victory, the more complex and profound the class struggle becomes. A handful of class enemies, unwilling to face their doom, are still making desperate struggles. They use various tricks and conspiracies, trying every means to interfere with the great strategic deployment of our great leader Chairman Mao and to shake the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. The reactionary "multi-center theory" is a reactionary theory used by a handful of class enemies at their wits' end to interfere with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and obstruct the implementation of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize, and resolutely eliminate this reactionary fallacy of bourgeois factionalism and individualism!

In the hearts of the working class, poor and lower-middle peasants, and the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, there is only one leadership center for the entire party, army, and country, and that is the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. Every instruction from Chairman Mao and every battle order from the proletarian headquarters, we will carry out and execute resolutely. The practice of revolutionary struggle has made us understand that whenever we act according to Chairman Mao's instructions and follow the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, we are invincible; whenever we deviate from Chairman Mao's teachings and go against the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters, we are at a standstill and achieve nothing. At the time of celebrating Chairman Mao's gift to us, we are more determined than ever: In the great struggle to achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must further strengthen the proletarian sense of unity, strengthen revolutionary organizational discipline, closely unite around the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, timely expose all the tricks and conspiracies of the class enemies, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and advance victoriously!

Recently, Chairman Mao pointed out profoundly: "Universities should still be run, and I am mainly talking about universities of science and engineering. The system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, and proletarian politics should be in command, following the path of the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory in training technical personnel from workers. Students should be selected from workers and peasants with practical experience, study in school for a few years, and then return to production practice." Chairman Mao's latest instruction most profoundly, thoroughly, and succinctly points out the direction of the proletarian educational revolution, is the great program of the proletarian educational revolution, and is a long-term plan for preventing revisionism; Chairman Mao's latest instruction speaks the words in the hearts of the working class and poor and lower-middle peasants. The Capital Workers and Peasants Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team will definitely, together with the revolutionary Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and staff of Tsinghua University, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's series of great instructions on educational revolution, carry the proletarian educational revolution to the end, and truly turn Tsinghua University into a red Mao Zedong Thought university. Our goal must be achieved! With Chairman Mao's resolute support, our goal must be achieved!

"Navigating the great sea relies on the helmsman, making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, use Mao Zedong Thought to guide every action of ours, forge the Capital Workers and Peasants Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team into a vanguard that closely follows Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and implements Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and forge it into a strong, highly revolutionary, and highly combat-ready working-class propaganda team, to make greater contributions to achieving comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! We must actively and enthusiastically carry out more in-depth, detailed, patient, and persistent propaganda work, resolutely unite with the revolutionary Red Guards, revolutionary teachers, and staff of Tsinghua University, fight together, and win together, turn Tsinghua University into a new-type proletarian university, let the invincible great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought fly high and forever in the sky of Tsinghua Garden!

　　紧紧团结在毛主席的无产阶级司令部周围
　　夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利
　　首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队
    在纪念毛主席《炮打司令部》的大字报和《中国共产党中央委员会关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》发表两周年的大喜日子里，我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席把外国朋友赠送给他的珍贵礼物——芒果，转送给了我们在清华大学的首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队。这一特大喜讯一传开，清华园内顿时沸腾起来。我们宣传队的全体革命战士热烈欢呼，纵情歌唱，沉浸在无比幸福的欢乐中。我们双手捧着毛主席赠送的珍贵礼物，仰望着毛主席的画像，心潮澎湃热泪流，人人挥舞着红色革命宝书《毛主席语录》，千遍万遍地欢呼：“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    毛主席向我们赠送珍贵礼物，这是对我们首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队最大的关怀、最大的支持、最大的鞭策！这是对在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部领导下团结战斗的全国亿万工农兵群众最大的关怀，最大的教育，最大的鼓舞！
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席，是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，最伟大的无产阶级革命领袖。毛主席最相信群众，最了解群众，最尊重革命群众的首创精神，和我们工人阶级、贫下中农永远心连心。我们首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队，在清华大学同革命的红卫兵小将和革命师生并肩战斗，共同落实毛主席的最新指示，刚刚取得了一些成绩，伟大领袖毛主席就向我们赠送珍贵礼物，这是对我们的最大支持。我们一辈子也不会忘记这件大喜事！真是天大地大不如党的恩情大，爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲！
    两年多的无产阶级文化大革命的战斗实践，使我们深深地懂得：以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，最集中地代表了我们工人阶级、贫下中农和广大革命群众的根本利益。我们最热爱以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，最痛恨以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部。当前，无产阶级文化大革命正处于夺取全面胜利的伟大征途中，无产阶级文化大革命越接近全面胜利，阶级斗争越是复杂，越是深刻。一小撮阶级敌人不甘心于他们的灭亡，他们还在作垂死的挣扎。他们变换各种花招，施展各种阴谋诡计，总是千方百计地企图干扰伟大领袖毛主席的伟大战略部署，妄图动摇以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部。反动的“多中心论”，就是一小撮穷途末路的阶级敌人用以干扰毛主席的伟大战略部署，阻碍毛主席革命路线贯彻执行的反动理论。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底批判、坚决清除这种资产阶级山头主义、个人主义的反动谬论！
    在我们工人阶级、贫下中农和解放军指战员的心窝里，全党、全军、全国只有一个领导中心，这就是以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部。毛主席的每一个指示，无产阶级司令部的每一个战斗号令，我们都坚决照办，坚决执行。革命斗争的实践，使我们懂得，什么时候按照毛主席的指示办事，按照以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的战斗号令行动，就无往而不胜；什么时候离开了毛主席的教导，违背了无产阶级司令部的战斗号令，就寸步难行，一事无成。在欢庆毛主席向我们赠送珍贵礼物的时候，我们更加坚定了这个决心：在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大斗争中，我们一定要进一步加强无产阶级的整体观念，加强革命的组织纪律性，紧紧团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部周围，及时识破阶级敌人的一切阴谋诡计，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，乘胜前进！
    毛主席最近深刻地指出：“大学还是要办的，我这里主要说的是理工科大学还要办，但学制要缩短，教育要革命，要无产阶级政治挂帅，走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路。要从有实践经验的工人农民中间选拔学生，到学校学几年以后，又回到生产实践中去。”毛主席的这一最新指示，最深刻、最透彻、最精辟地指出了无产阶级教育革命的方向，是无产阶级教育革命的伟大纲领，是反修防修的百年大计；毛主席的这一最新指示，说出了我们工人阶级和贫下中农的心里话。我们首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队一定同清华大学革命的红卫兵小将和革命师生员工在一起，坚决贯彻执行毛主席关于教育革命的一系列伟大指示，把无产阶级教育革命进行到底，把清华大学真正办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。我们的目的一定要达到！有毛主席的坚决支持，我们的目的也一定能达到！
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更好地活学活用毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想统帅我们的每一个行动，把首都工农毛泽东思想宣传队锻炼成一支紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署、落实毛主席最新指示的先锋队，锻炼成一支非常革命化、非常战斗化的坚强的工人阶级宣传队，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利做出更大的贡献！我们一定要积极热情地进行更加深入细致的、耐心的、持久的宣传工作，坚决和清华大学的革命的红卫兵小将、革命的师生员工团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起，把清华大学办成无产阶级的新型的大学，让战无不胜的毛泽东思想伟大红旗在清华园的上空高高飘扬，永远飘扬！
