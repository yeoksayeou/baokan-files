Comrade Editor,

On the eve of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the *People's Daily* and the *Liberation Army Daily* published an editorial titled "Warmly Congratulate the Establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of Yunnan Province," which conveyed our great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Chairman Mao pointed out: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully give play to the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and in all work. The working class should also continuously raise its political awareness in the course of struggle." We Red Guards are filled with boundless excitement and joy, warmly hailing the issuance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions!

At the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we Red Guards eagerly responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "pay attention to state affairs and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end!" We took to the streets, smashing the Four Olds and establishing the Four News. Once, a few of us Red Guards went to the home of a notorious capitalist to smash the Four Olds. Two old workers, upon hearing this, warned us, "That guy is very reactionary. Before liberation, he oppressed workers terribly! You must be vigilant." As expected by the old workers, when this reactionary saw us enter his home, he went crazy, grabbed a weapon, and lunged at us. At this critical moment, an old worker fearlessly rushed forward, protecting the lives of us Red Guards.

This incident taught us a great lesson, making us deeply feel that: the working class is the most loyal to Chairman Mao, has the deepest proletarian feelings, the firmest class stance, and the clearest love and hate. They truly deserve to be our leading class and learning example.

The issuance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions further points out the direction for us. We must forever learn from the working class, strengthen our ideological transformation, promote ideological revolutionization, and forever be Red Guards who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

### 工人阶级爱憎最分明

    工人阶级爱憎最分明编辑同志：
    在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的前夕，《人民日报》《解放军报》在《热烈欢呼云南省革命委员会成立》的社论中，传达了我们伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示。毛主席指出：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”我们红卫兵小将以无比兴奋、无比激动的心情，热烈地欢呼毛主席最新指示的发表！
    在无产阶级文化大革命刚刚开始的时候，我们红卫兵小将积极响应毛主席“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”的伟大号召，冲上街头，大破四旧，大立四新。有一次，我们几个红卫兵要到一个一贯反动的资本家的家里去破四旧。有两个老工人知道后，就提醒我们说：“这家伙很反动，解放前压迫工人可狠啦！你们可要提高警惕。”果然不出老工人所料，当这个反动家伙看到我们进了他家的时候，就疯狂地拿起凶器，向我们扑了过来。正在危急的时刻，一个老工人奋不顾身地冲了上来，保护了我们红卫兵的生命安全。
    这件事对我们教育很大，使我们深深地体会到：工人阶级对毛主席最忠，无产阶级感情最深，阶级立场最坚定，爱憎最分明。他们不愧是我们的领导阶级和学习榜样。
    毛主席最新指示的发表，进一步给我们指出了方向，我们一定要永远向工人阶级学习，加强自己的思想改造，促进思想革命化，永远做一个无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的红卫兵。
