New China News Agency, August 7th: In the midst of the nation's joyous celebration of the second anniversary of Chairman Mao's "Bombard the Headquarters" big-character poster and the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," the news of our beloved great leader Chairman Mao gifting precious items to the capital workers and peasants Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams has greatly inspired the nationwide working class and millions of workers, peasants, and soldiers. From the capital to the border, from cities to rural areas, countless voices are spreading the same news, and countless red hearts are turning towards the red sun. Revolutionary masses across the country have unanimously cheered: Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Ten thousand years!

The news spread, and from the Yangtze River to the north, from the Great Wall to the border, in factories, mines, stations, docks, villages, fishing towns, sports fields, and barracks, everywhere was a scene of jubilation. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and revolutionary masses said, Chairman Mao gifting precious items to the capital workers and peasants Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams is the greatest concern, greatest inspiration, greatest education, and greatest encouragement for the working class of the capital and the revolutionary masses across the country!

In major cities like Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin, the working class and revolutionary masses celebrated today as if it were a grand festival, banging drums and gongs, parading in the streets, and posting big red announcements to warmly celebrate the great leader Chairman Mao's greatest concern. Workers from dozens of factories participating in the capital workers and peasants Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams were all immersed in boundless happiness. Workers, holding Chairman Mao's precious gifts with both hands, were moved to tears. They expressed their profound proletarian feelings of love for the great leader Chairman Mao, saying, Chairman Mao has given us the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the mighty spiritual atom bomb! Chairman Mao supports us, and we will forever make Chairman Mao proud! From early morning to late night, the streets of Shanghai were filled with joy. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers enthusiastically cheered, saying, the great leader Chairman Mao loves, believes in, and respects the revolutionary masses' pioneering spirit the most. We workers, peasants, and soldiers will not disappoint Chairman Mao's earnest expectations. We will definitely study and apply Mao Zedong Thought better, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, follow all battle orders of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, thoroughly criticize the reactionary bourgeois "multi-center theory," and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Revolutionary old workers in Tianjin's San Tiao Shi excitedly said, it is Chairman Mao who saved us from the old society of deep suffering. Chairman Mao is the reddest red sun in our hearts! Where Chairman Mao points, we will strike!

The great news spread to cities like Shenyang, Xi'an, Chengdu, Wuhan, and Guangzhou, where the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, who are advancing vigorously to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, became even more spirited and determined. In the Guangzhou area, workers and peasants Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams and the masses marched out, banging drums and gongs, setting off firecrackers, and enthusiastically cheering the great leader Chairman Mao's greatest concern for the hundreds of millions of revolutionary people across the country. "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Wish Chairman Mao eternal life!" The cheers echoed through the skies of the southern gate of the motherland. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers declared their determination to unite more closely around the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and build the Guangzhou area into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.

In the steel city of Anshan, the masses gathered in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, expressing their loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao one by one. Steelworkers excitedly said, the great leader Chairman Mao always cares for us, the working class. We, the working class, must always be loyal to Chairman Mao! We must turn Chairman Mao's great concern into a powerful force, grasp the revolution, promote production, and achieve new victories in the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

The news spread to the front lines of the ten thousand li sea defense and border defense, to various camps and sentry posts, to various naval docks, ships, and air force bases. The broad cadres and fighters, with their boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, repeatedly raised their fists and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" They resolutely declared that they would definitely stand guard and keep watch for the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, defend the great socialist motherland to the death, and be ready to "exert all efforts to annihilate the invading enemy" at any time. Cadres and fighters of a certain unit of the South China Fleet, who were holding a meeting to celebrate the second anniversary of Chairman Mao's "Bombard the Headquarters" big-character poster, and local revolutionary masses, upon hearing the news, repeatedly sang "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman."

They said, where the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao points, we will strike; what Chairman Mao says, we will do. Whoever dares to oppose the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and sabotage Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, we will definitely overthrow them! Some famous labor models and heroic fighters of the People's Liberation Army, with their boundless love for Chairman Mao and deep hatred for a handful of class enemies, pointed out deeply that the reactionary "multi-center theory" blown from the gutter is a poisoned arrow shot by a handful of desperate class enemies attempting to sabotage Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters. They want the bourgeois center, oppose the proletarian center; they want the bourgeois headquarters, oppose the proletarian headquarters; they think of the private interests of bourgeois factionalism and individualism, harm the interests of the revolution and the proletariat; they walk the road of capitalist restoration, oppose the socialist road. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers declared that they would definitely smash the reactionary "multi-center theory," forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever unite around Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and resolutely achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

They expressed their determination to definitely study and apply Mao Zedong Thought better, highlight proletarian politics, strengthen their own ideological revolutionization, and together with revolutionary Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and staff, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and educational revolution to the end, thoroughly ending the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools. Recently, comrades from nearly a hundred Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda teams composed of workers in Shanghai have been propagating Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin in some schools and factories. Upon hearing the news, they excitedly said, we will definitely not disappoint the great leader Chairman Mao's warm concern.

Students from the "May 7th Commune" Class 201 of Tongji University, who are learning from the experience of cultivating technical personnel from workers at the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, excitedly said upon hearing the news that they will definitely seriously learn from the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, resolutely walk the path of combining with workers and peasants, and advance bravely along the direction indicated by Chairman Mao. Many revolutionary Red Guards from the New Guiyang Medical College are ready to go to the countryside. They said, the path of combining with workers and peasants indicated by Chairman Mao is our only bright path, and we will definitely walk it for life. Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students from the "May 7th Agricultural Teachers" educational revolution exploration team of Henan Agricultural University said, the working class and broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers are not only the main force of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution but also the main force of the proletarian educational revolution. They have the deepest feelings for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, the deepest hatred for the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of Liu Shaoqi, the richest experience in class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, the greatest determination to carry out the proletarian educational revolution, and know best what to change and how to change. We must definitely follow the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, firmly walk the path of combining with workers and peasants, and carry the proletarian educational revolution to the end. Revolutionary Red Guards in the Lanzhou area were extremely excited and joyful upon hearing the news, celebrating with drums and gongs at night. They said, the working class and masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers are the most loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao and follow the strategic deployment of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin the most closely. We are determined to go to the countryside, to the border, to factories and mines, to the grassroots, and in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, temper ourselves into reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

The great news that Chairman Mao gifted precious items to the capital workers and peasants Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams spread, and soldiers from a certain unit of the Beijing Garrison felt boundless joy and excitement. They declared their determination to fight alongside the revolutionary masses of workers and peasants in the struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and resolutely achieve new victories for the people.
