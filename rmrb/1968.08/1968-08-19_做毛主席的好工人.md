	Being a Good Worker for Chairman Mao

	Editor Comrade:

	At this crucial moment when we are under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao to seize the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao's latest directive has been issued. This is the greatest concern, encouragement, education, and spur for us, the working class!

	The working class follows Chairman Mao in making revolution. Reflecting on the two years of battle in the Cultural Revolution, every victory we have achieved has shone with the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought!

	When Chairman Mao issued the directive: "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions," we workers spread the news. Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! You have spoken the words in our hearts. In the old society, we workers were like bitter gourds on the same vine, separated by the reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev. We follow Chairman Mao's teachings and the two factions jointly established Mao Zedong Thought study classes. At the beginning, the two factions were clearly divided, one side on one side, the other side on the other, truly going our separate ways. The struggle against selfishness began, and "machine guns" and "cannons" were always aimed at others, as if we were always "consistently correct" and "old revolutionaries." At this time, we focused on studying Chairman Mao's great teachings: each side should make more self-criticism. With the help of the leftist support and propaganda team of the People's Liberation Army guided by Mao Zedong Thought, we jointly recalled the bitterness of suffering under the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie and tasted the sweetness of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We actively made more self-criticism, and both sides found a common language. The seats that were originally "clearly divided" were also mixed up, and everyone sat in a circle. An old worker who was deceived said: "I must immediately return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Even a second's delay is disloyalty to Chairman Mao." To consolidate and develop the great unity of the revolution, some worker comrades, fearing ridicule and not minding hard work, actively did ideological work among the deceived masses. Although they encountered many difficulties, they never gave up. Everyone had only one belief: "Doing one more piece of work among the deceived masses is adding one more bit of strength to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line." Now the unity among the revolutionary workers of the entire factory is more solid than ever.

	Following Chairman Mao is victory, is the direction. The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has prepared the conditions for a new industrial revolution. Now the production situation of the entire factory is also very good. The revolutionary workers of the first workshop have created unprecedented high-quality and high-yield records in history. The scientific experiments of the entire factory have also achieved great success. Steel rolling equipment that has never been produced domestically before is now in production in our factory, and some are being test-run. We, the working class, have decided to present abundant fruits to the great National Day. We will not disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations. In the great storms of class struggle, we must "raise our political awareness" and promote the revolutionization of our thinking, forever being good workers who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

    做毛主席的好工人编辑同志：
    正当我们在以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的领导下，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的关键时刻，毛主席最新指示发表了。这是对我们工人阶级的最大关怀、最大鼓舞、最大教育、最大鞭策！
    工人阶级跟着毛主席闹革命。回忆文化大革命战斗的两年，我们所取得的每一个胜利，哪一个不闪烁着毛泽东思想的万丈光芒！
    当毛主席发出指示：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”我们工人奔走相告。毛主席啊，毛主席！您老人家说出了我们工人阶级的心里话。在旧社会我们工人兄弟是一根藤上的苦瓜，是中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线把我们分了家。我们遵循毛主席的教导，两派合办起了毛泽东思想学习班。一开始两派分得很清，这边一排，那边一排，真是大路朝天，各走半边。斗私开始了，“机关枪”、“大炮”老是朝着别人放，好象自己就是“一贯正确”“老造反”。这时，我们着重学习了毛主席的伟大教导：各自多做自我批评。在支左解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，我们共同回忆受资产阶级反动路线的苦，一同体会享毛主席革命路线的甜，主动多做自我批评，双方有了共同的语言。原来“阵营分明”的位子也打乱了，大家围成一个圆圈。一个受蒙蔽的老工人说：“我要立刻回到毛主席革命路线这一边，多一秒钟时间的拖延，就是对毛主席不忠。”为了巩固和发展革命的大联合，有的工人同志，不怕讽刺，不嫌劳累，主动作受蒙蔽群众的思想工作。虽然遇到很多困难，他们从不灰心，大家心里只有一个信念：“多做一个受蒙蔽群众的工作，就是给毛主席的革命路线增加一分力量。”现在全厂革命工人之间的团结，比任何时候都要巩固。
    紧跟毛主席就是胜利，就是方向。史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，为新的工业革命准备了条件。现在全厂的生产形势也是一片大好。第一车间的革命职工创造了历史上前所未有的优质高产。全厂科学实验也取得很大成绩，国内过去从未生产过的轧钢设备，现在我厂有的已投入生产，有的正在试车。我们工人阶级决定以丰硕成果，向伟大的国庆节献礼。我们决不辜负毛主席他老人家的期望，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中要“提高自己的政治觉悟”，促进思想革命化，永远做一个无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席革命路线的好工人。
