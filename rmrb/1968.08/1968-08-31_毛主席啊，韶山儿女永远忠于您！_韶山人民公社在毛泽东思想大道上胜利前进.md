The place where the brightest red sun in our hearts rose—Shaoshan People's Commune in Xiangtan County, Hunan Province—has seen its broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and commune members, filled with profound proletarian feelings of boundless love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, enthusiastically celebrate the tenth anniversary of the establishment of Shaoshan People's Commune.

Over the past decade, the poor and lower-middle peasants of this commune, nurtured by the great thought of Mao Zedong, have held high the great red banner of "People's Communes are good" and advanced courageously in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation. Shaoshan has undergone tremendous changes.

The People of Shaoshan Love Chairman Mao Deeply

Shaoshan is the hometown of our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, a revolutionary holy land that people all over China and the world yearn for. Here, the poor and lower-middle peasants live happily in the cradle of revolution, basking in the radiant sunlight of the great thought of Mao Zedong. From children a few years old to elderly people in their seventies and eighties, everyone has a heart that loves Chairman Mao deeply. In Shaoshan, every household hangs a portrait of Chairman Mao and posts quotations from Chairman Mao. The commune members all wear shining Mao badges. They never part from Chairman Mao's books and never stop reciting Chairman Mao's teachings. Fields and work sites are all classrooms for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. At every meeting of the production brigade and production team, they first wish Chairman Mao longevity and sing "The East Is Red" and read the highest directives. Many commune members have established the practice of "daily reading" of Chairman Mao's works at home. The "three loyalties" campaign—loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line—has been widely and deeply carried out. The people of Shaoshan say, "Father and mother are not as dear as Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao's kindness will be remembered for generations. Forever loyal to Chairman Mao is our greatest happiness."

Every mountain and river in Shaoshan shines with the brilliant light of Chairman Mao's revolutionary activities in the past; every blade of grass and tree is filled with Chairman Mao's boundless affection for the people. Some of the farmers who were members of the farmers' association, self-defense corps, and children's corps with Chairman Mao in the past, recalling the happy scenes of revolution with Chairman Mao, excitedly say, "The revolutionary flames of Shaoshan were personally ignited by Chairman Mao, and the party branch of Shaoshan was personally established by Chairman Mao." In 1925, Chairman Mao returned to Shaoshan to lead the poor farmers in their struggle for liberation. In a short time, red flags flew over Shaoshan, the farmers' association was established, the farmers' self-defense corps was organized, and the poor farmers took control, trampling the exploitative landlords and evil gentry underfoot. After the failure of the Great Revolution, the people of Shaoshan did not surrender to the white terror. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, they fought on, one after another.

Drinking water, never forgetting the well-digger; liberation, never forgetting Chairman Mao. Many revolutionary grassroots cadres, Communist Party members, and poor and lower-middle peasants often collectively visit Chairman Mao's former residence and exhibition hall to pay their respects, study, and make pledges. Many commune members, supporting the elderly and leading the young, visit Chairman Mao's former residence and exhibition hall to study time and time again. Li Shaochi, an 83-year-old old peasant from Songjiawan Production Brigade of Shaobei Production Team, has taken his grandchildren to visit the exhibition hall of Chairman Mao's former residence many times. This year, he came to the exhibition hall with a cane, respectfully saluted Chairman Mao's portrait, and carefully listened to the guide's introduction of the great revolutionary practice of the great leader Chairman Mao. He said, "Revolutionary people from home and abroad come thousands of miles to Chairman Mao's hometown to visit and study. We who were born in Shaoshan should think of Chairman Mao every moment and follow Chairman Mao closely." This 83-year-old old peasant has the red sun in his heart and grows younger every day. He often sings the song of Chairman Mao's quotations "Go and Strive for Victory," does some things within his ability for the collective, and expresses his loyalty to Chairman Mao.

The people of Shaoshan, with a glorious revolutionary tradition, have pushed the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought to new heights in the great proletarian cultural revolution. From the commune to the production team, from the fields and courtyards to the homes of the poor and lower-middle peasants, various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes have been set up everywhere. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, with "criticizing revisionism and repudiating the self" as the key link, have studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought with problems from class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. Their spiritual outlook has undergone tremendous changes.

Mao Zaixi, an old poor peasant from Shaoshan Production Team, is a typical representative of the people of Shaoshan who persist in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. As early as the Great Revolution period, the whole family of Mao Zaixi joined the farmers' association, and he himself was a member of the children's corps. Mao Zaixi remembers the glorious revolutionary tradition of the people of Shaoshan and has written beside Chairman Mao's portrait, "Four volumes of great writings are never put down, forever keeping the rivers and mountains red for generations." Under his organization, in recent years, his whole family has persisted in reading Chairman Mao's works every day. During festivals, he takes his family to eat bitter food, educating the whole family not to forget class bitterness, to be forever loyal to Chairman Mao, and to be forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought. He said, "Of all the rules, studying Chairman Mao's works is the first; of all the busyness, studying Chairman Mao's works cannot be forgotten!"

Never Let the Capitalist Black Wind Blow into the Revolutionary Holy Land

The poor and lower-middle peasants and commune members of Shaoshan People's Commune, who are infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, have firmly followed the course indicated by Chairman Mao in the past decade of commune construction, resolutely fought against the counter-revolutionary revisionist line pushed by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, and made the people's commune better and better.

Shaoshan People's Commune, like people's communes all over the country, showed strong vitality and unparalleled superiority as soon as it was established. The Chinese Khrushchev's agents in Hunan were terrified and hated it to death. They either came to Shaoshan in person or sent their trusted henchmen to peddle counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods such as "three autonomies and one contract" and "class struggle is extinguished," attempting to restore capitalism in Shaoshan. They also obstructed and sabotaged the construction of Chairman Mao's revolutionary memorial sites, attempting to resist the widespread dissemination of Mao Zedong Thought. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought stood firmly on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and fought a head-on battle with a handful of class enemies. They reviewed the brilliant course of revolutionary struggle under Chairman Mao's wise leadership over the past few decades, stood up to the black wind that attempted to restore capitalism, exposed and criticized the heinous crimes of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party who sabotaged the construction of Chairman Mao's revolutionary memorial sites. A handful of capitalist-roaders within the party hated them to death and cursed them as "good at resisting" and "not listening." The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants angrily said: "Capitalist things, we must resist; the black words of capitalist-roaders, we will not listen. We follow Chairman Mao in revolution, shed blood and sacrifice, and have fought for the socialist mountains and rivers, established people's communes. The class enemies want to change the color of our mountains and rivers and destroy the people's communes, which is a pipe dream!"

During the great proletarian cultural revolution, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and commune members followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, remembered Chairman Mao's great teaching that "one of our important tasks on the ideological front now is to carry out a criticism of revisionism," and launched a deep and sustained revolutionary criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line pushed by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents. In various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, in courtyards and fields, revolutionary criticism battlefields were set up everywhere. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants spoke out and wrote, each vying to be a critic. The Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, a handful of untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, fell into the vast ocean of mass struggle. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants said: "Before liberation, landlords and capitalists exploited us so that we had no roof over our heads and no land under our feet. The Chinese Khrushchev said they 'deserved to exploit,' which is a barefaced attempt to serve the exploiting classes and make us poor and lower-middle peasants go back on our way and suffer twice. We will never agree to that!"

Forty-three years ago, the great leader Chairman Mao personally established the earliest and strongest party branch in rural Hunan—the CPC Shaoshan Branch. Mao Fuxuan, the son of the first secretary of this branch and a Communist Party member, remembered Chairman Mao's teaching: "Tens of thousands of martyrs sacrificed their lives for the people's interests in front of us. Let us hold high their banner and march forward on their blood-stained path!" He actively led the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to carry out revolutionary criticism. He said: "We revolutionary successors must inherit and carry forward the glorious revolutionary tradition of the older generation and follow the great leader Chairman Mao in revolution. Our hearts will not change even if the rivers and mountains crumble!" Under the leadership of Comrade Mao Diqiu, the Shaoxi Production Brigade and various production teams carried out revolutionary criticism vigorously. Through deep and sustained criticism, the class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants was greatly enhanced, and socialist enthusiasm reached an unprecedented height, making the socialist positions in the countryside more and more consolidated!

Forever Following Chairman Mao from Victory to Greater Victory

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and commune members of Shaoshan People's Commune have firmly followed the great leader Chairman Mao for a decade, advancing on the bright path indicated by Chairman Mao of "People's Communes are good," and achieved brilliant victories.

In 1959, the great leader Chairman Mao returned to Shaoshan for the third time and wrote the brilliant poem "Seven-Character Quatrain: To Shaoshan," highly praising the revolutionary struggle of the people of Shaoshan and the people all over the country to overturn the old world and build socialism and their heroic spirit. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and commune members of Shaoshan People's Commune drew boundless strength from Chairman Mao's loving care. In the construction of people's communes, they responded enthusiastically to Chairman Mao's great call to "learn from Dazhai in agriculture," held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, stressed proletarian politics, carried forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat of "for the sake of sacrifice, many have great aspirations, daring to make the sun and moon change the sky," worked hard, relied on self-reliance, and relied on the unparalleled superiority of the people's communes' "big and public" nature to achieve great success in the struggle against nature.

Shaoshan People's Commune is crisscrossed with gullies, with more mountains than fields, and severe water and drought disasters. In the past, the yield was very low. At that time, there was a folk song: "Shaoshan Gorge, Shaoshan Gorge, nine out of ten households are poor." After liberation, the face of Shaoshan changed greatly. After the establishment of the people's commune, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants seriously studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, and their spiritual outlook changed, which drove the great development of production.

"See the waves of rice and millet, heroes everywhere at dusk." Since the establishment of the commune, they have built four reservoirs, repaired nearly eight hundred mountain ponds and more than sixty dams, and dug dozens of miles of irrigation channels, making more than 80% of the farmland in the entire commune drought and flood resistant. Before liberation, only one crop of rice was planted here, and now the double-crop rice area has accounted for more than 90% of the total area. Last year's grain yield per acre has increased from 500 catties before the establishment of the commune to 915 catties. This year, although the early rice suffered from a rare mountain flood disaster in decades, it still achieved a better harvest than last year.

Over the past decade, the socialist collective economy of Shaoshan People's Commune has developed and grown stronger. Now, the entire commune has more than twenty large tractors and hand-held tractors, and the area of mechanized farming is expanding. The entire commune has established ten electric irrigation stations, owning more than twenty irrigation machines. The processing of rice, cotton, and other agricultural and sideline products has all been mechanized and semi-mechanized. The commune and brigade enterprises have also developed greatly, establishing ten commune-run enterprises such as tea fields, orchards, fisheries, and forest farms. Each production brigade has agricultural and sideline product processing plants. Each level of the commune and brigade has reserve grain. Last year, after completing the grain procurement task, the entire commune voluntarily sold an additional 170,000 catties of surplus grain to the state.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, in the battle to conquer nature, think of the great leader Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's magnificent lines of "for the sake of sacrifice, many have great aspirations, daring to make the sun and moon change the sky," and are full of energy, redoubling their efforts, inspiring them to advance from victory to greater victory.

On the joyous day of celebrating the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the people's commune, the people of Shaoshan, reviewing the great achievements of the past decade, felt more deeply that following the great leader Chairman Mao is victory! They are determined to continue to advance on the course opened by Chairman Mao and make Shaoshan People's Commune a red school of Mao Zedong Thought!

    毛主席啊，韶山儿女永远忠于您！
    ——韶山人民公社在毛泽东思想大道上胜利前进
    我们心中最红最红的红太阳升起的地方——湖南省湘潭县韶山人民公社的广大贫下中农和社员群众，满怀对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚的深厚无产阶级感情，热烈欢庆韶山人民公社建立十周年。
    十年来，这个公社的贫下中农在伟大的毛泽东思想哺育下，高举“人民公社好”的伟大红旗，在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动中奋勇前进，使韶山发生了巨大变化。
      韶山儿女无限热爱毛主席
    韶山，是我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的家乡，是全国和全世界革命人民无比向往的革命圣地。这里的贫下中农幸福地生活在革命摇篮里，最先沐浴着伟大的毛泽东思想的灿烂阳光。从几岁的娃娃到七、八十岁的老人，都有一颗无限热爱毛主席的红心。在韶山，家家户户都挂着毛主席像，贴着毛主席语录，社员们的胸前都佩戴着金光闪闪的毛主席像章。他们身不离毛主席的书，口不离毛主席的教导，田头、工地到处都是活学活用毛主席著作的课堂。大队、生产队每次开会，首先敬祝毛主席万寿无疆，高唱《东方红》和朗读最高指示。许多社员的家里，都建立了“天天读”毛主席著作的制度。忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的“三忠于”活动，广泛深入地开展了起来。韶山人民说，爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲，毛主席的恩情千秋万代不能忘。永远忠于毛主席，就是我们韶山人民最大最大的幸福。
    韶山的一山一水，都闪耀着毛主席当年从事革命活动的灿烂光辉；韶山的一草一木，都饱含着毛主席对人民的无限深情。一些当年跟毛主席干革命的农民协会会员、自卫队员、儿童团员想起当年跟毛主席干革命的幸福情景，激动地说，韶山的革命烈火是毛主席亲自点燃的，韶山的党支部是毛主席亲手创建的。一九二五年，毛主席回韶山领导贫苦农民闹翻身求解放，在很短时间内，红旗漫卷韶山，建立了农民协会，组织起农民自卫队，使贫苦农民掌握了印把子，把吃人的土豪劣绅踩在了脚下。大革命失败后，韶山人民没有在白色恐怖下屈服，他们在毛主席和共产党的领导下，前赴后继，坚持斗争。
    饮水不忘掘井人，翻身不忘毛主席。许多革命的基层干部、共产党员和贫下中农，经常集体到毛主席旧居和毛主席旧居陈列馆瞻仰、学习、表决心。许多社员扶老携幼，一次又一次地到毛主席旧居和陈列馆学习。韶北大队宋家弯生产队八十三岁的老贫农李少池，曾经多次带领儿孙到毛主席旧居陈列馆参观。今年，他又扶着拐杖来陈列馆，恭恭敬敬地在毛主席像前敬了礼，仔细地听讲解员介绍伟大领袖毛主席的伟大革命实践。他说，国内外革命人民不远千里万里来毛主席家乡参观学习，我们生长在韶山，更应该时时刻刻想着毛主席，紧跟毛主席。这位八十三岁的老贫农心中有了红太阳，越活越年青。他常常唱着毛主席语录歌《去争取胜利》，为集体作些力所能及的事，表示对毛主席的一片忠心。
    富有光荣革命传统的韶山儿女，在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，把活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动不断推向新的高潮。从公社到生产队，从田头、屋场到贫下中农社员的家庭，普遍办起了不同类型的毛泽东思想学习班。广大贫下中农和革命干部，以“斗私，批修”为纲，带着阶级斗争和两条路线斗争中的问题，活学活用毛泽东思想，精神面貌发生了巨大的变化。
    韶山生产队老贫农社员毛再燧，是韶山人民坚持活学活用毛泽东思想的一个典型代表。早在大革命时期，毛再燧全家都参加了农会，他自己当时是儿童团员。毛再燧牢记韶山儿女的光荣革命传统，在毛主席像旁写下了“雄文四卷不离手，永保江山代代红”的誓言。在他的组织下，近年来他们全家坚持天天读毛主席著作。逢年过节，他带着一家人吃忆苦饭，教育全家不忘阶级苦，永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想。他说，千条万条，学习毛主席著作是第一条；千忙万忙，学习毛主席著作不能忘！
    决不让资本主义黑风吹进革命圣地
    无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的韶山公社贫下中农和社员群众，在十年来的公社建设中，始终坚定不移地沿着毛主席指引的航向奋勇前进，同中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人推行的反革命修正主义路线进行坚决的斗争，把人民公社越办越好。
    韶山人民公社和全国各地的人民公社一样，刚一建立就显示了强大的生命力和无比的优越性。中国赫鲁晓夫在湖南的代理人怕得要死，恨得要命，他们或亲自窜来韶山，或派来亲信爪牙，大肆贩卖“三自一包”、“阶级斗争熄灭”论等反革命修正主义黑货，妄图在韶山复辟资本主义。他们还阻挠和破坏毛主席革命纪念地的建设，妄图抵制毛泽东思想的广泛传播。用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大贫下中农和革命群众，坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，同一小撮阶级敌人进行了针锋相对的斗争。他们回顾在毛主席英明领导下几十年革命斗争的光辉历程，奋起顶住了妄图复辟资本主义的黑风，揭露和批判了党内一小撮走资派破坏毛主席革命纪念地建设的滔天罪行。党内一小撮走资派对他们恨得要死，骂他们“好顶”，“不听话”。广大贫下中农愤怒地说：“资本主义的东西，我们就是要顶；走资派的黑话，我们就是不听。我们紧跟毛主席干革命，流血牺牲，打出了社会主义江山，建立了人民公社，阶级敌人妄想使我们的江山变色，搞垮人民公社，是白日做梦！”
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，广大贫下中农和社员群众紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢记毛主席的“我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判”的伟大教导，对中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人推行的反革命修正主义路线，展开了深入持久的革命大批判。在各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班里，在屋场、田间，到处摆下了革命大批判的战场。广大贫下中农人人口诛笔伐，个个争当批判家。中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人，一小撮没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，陷入了群众斗争的汪洋大海。广大贫下中农说：“解放前，地主、资本家剥削得我们上无片瓦，下无寸土，中国赫鲁晓夫还说他们‘剥削有功’，这是明目张胆地为剥削阶级效劳，想让我们贫下中农走回头路，吃二遍苦，我们一万个不答应！”
    四十三年前，伟大领袖毛主席亲自创建了湖南农村最早最坚强的党支部——中共韶山支部。这个支部第一任支部书记毛福轩烈士的儿子、共产党员毛迪秋，牢记毛主席的教导：“成千成万的先烈，为着人民的利益，在我们的前头英勇地牺牲了，让我们高举起他们的旗帜，踏着他们的血迹前进吧！”积极带领广大贫下中农开展革命大批判。他说：“我们革命后代一定要继承、发扬老一辈的光荣革命传统，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席干革命，海枯石烂不变心！”在毛迪秋同志的带领下，他所在韶西大队和各生产队，革命大批判搞得轰轰烈烈。通过深入持久的大批判，广大贫下中农的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟大大提高，社会主义积极性空前高涨，农村的社会主义阵地越来越巩固了！
  永远跟着毛主席从胜利走向更大的胜利
    韶山公社广大贫下中农和社员群众，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，十年来坚定地沿着毛主席指引的“人民公社好”的光明大道前进，取得了辉煌的胜利。
    一九五九年，伟大领袖毛主席第三次回到韶山，写下了光辉壮丽的诗篇《七律·到韶山》，高度赞扬了韶山人民和全国人民翻天覆地的革命斗争和建设社会主义的英雄气概。韶山公社广大贫下中农和社员群众从毛主席的亲切关怀中得到了无穷无尽的力量。在人民公社的建设中，他们坚决响应毛主席“农业学大寨”的伟大号召，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大力突出无产阶级政治，发扬“为有牺牲多壮志，敢教日月换新天”的无产阶级的彻底革命精神，艰苦奋斗，自力更生，依靠人民公社一大二公的无比优越性，在同大自然的搏斗中取得了很大成就。
    韶山公社山冲纵横，山多田少，水旱灾害严重，过去产量很低。那时，流传着这样的歌谣：“韶山冲，韶山冲，十户人家九户穷。”解放以后，韶山的面貌发生了很大变化。人民公社建立后，广大贫下中农认真活学活用毛主席著作，精神面貌的改变，带动了生产的大发展。
      “喜看稻菽千重浪，遍地英雄下夕烟。”公社化以来，他们共兴建了四座水库，整修了近八百口山塘和六十多座坝，开了几十里排灌渠道，使全公社百分之八十以上的农田实现了旱涝保收。解放前，这里只种一季稻，现在双季稻面积已占总面积的百分之九十以上。去年粮食亩产量已由公社化前的五百斤提高到了九百一十五斤。今年早稻虽然遭受了几十年来少有的山洪灾害，还是取得了比去年还好的收成。
    十年来，韶山公社的社会主义集体经济得到了不断的发展壮大。现在，全公社已拥有二十多台大型拖拉机和手扶拖拉机，机耕面积不断扩大。全公社建立了十个电动排灌站，拥有排灌机械二十多台。打米、轧花等农副产品的加工，都实现了机械化和半机械化。社、队企业也有很大发展，先后建立了茶场、果园、渔场、林场等十处社办企业，各大队都有农副产品加工厂。社、队各级都有了储备粮。去年全公社在完成粮食征购任务以后，还主动地多卖给国家十七万多斤余粮。
    广大贫下中农在征服大自然的战斗中，一想起伟大领袖毛主席，一想起毛主席“为有牺牲多壮志，敢教日月换新天”的豪迈诗句，就浑身是劲，干劲倍增，鼓舞着他们从胜利走向更大的胜利。
    在欢庆人民公社成立十周年的大喜日子里，韶山人民回顾十年来取得的巨大成就，更加深切地体会到：紧跟伟大领袖毛主席就是胜利！他们决心沿着毛主席开辟的航道继续奋勇前进，把韶山公社办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校！　新华社记者
