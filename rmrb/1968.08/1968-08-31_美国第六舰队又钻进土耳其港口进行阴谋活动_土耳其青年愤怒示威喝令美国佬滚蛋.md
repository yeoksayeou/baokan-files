The U.S. Sixth Fleet Again Intrudes into Turkish Ports for Conspiracy Activities
Turkish Youth Angrily Protest, Ordering the Americans to Get Out

	NEW DELHI, Aug. 30 (Xinhua) — In the western Turkish port of Izmir, a protest against U.S. imperialism erupted on August 29. Approximately one thousand young students marched in the streets, strongly protesting the reappearance of the U.S. Sixth Fleet in the port of Izmir.

	The protesting students wrote slogans such as “The Sixth Fleet, get out!” on the streets. They also called on the residents of Izmir to boycott the more than four thousand American soldiers who came ashore.

	The U.S. Sixth Fleet had already sneaked into the Turkish ports of Istanbul and Izmir in July, triggering a nationwide anti-U.S. wave in Turkey. The protesters angrily shouted, “Damn American bastards, go back!” “The Sixth Fleet, get out!” The American soldiers who came ashore were beaten up like rats crossing the street. In Istanbul alone, dozens of American soldiers were injured by the angry crowd. Many U.S. aggression agencies in the Turkish capital Ankara, such as the “International Development Agency,” the U.S. Information Agency, Pan American Airlines, and the Turkish-American Bank, were also pelted with stones by the angry crowd. This left the U.S. imperialists in a very embarrassing situation, and they hastily withdrew their warships. However, just one month later, the U.S. warships shamelessly returned to the Turkish ports, attempting another so-called “friendly visit.”

	According to reports, to ensure the “success” of this activity by the U.S. warships, the U.S. imperialists ordered the Turkish authorities to take all necessary suppression measures to prevent another large-scale anti-U.S. protest like the one last month. On the day before the U.S. warships arrived, the mayor of Izmir even shamelessly publicly asked the citizens to be “friendly and polite” to the American soldiers. However, the Turkish people paid no attention to them and still held protests, ordering the unwelcome U.S. Sixth Fleet to get out.

    美国第六舰队又钻进土耳其港口进行阴谋活动
    土耳其青年愤怒示威喝令美国佬滚蛋
    新华社三十日讯　伊兹密尔消息：在土耳其西部港口伊兹密尔，二十九日爆发反对美帝的群众示威。大约一千名青年学生在大街上游行，强烈抗议美国第六舰队又开到伊兹密尔港活动。
    示威学生在街上涂写“第六舰队滚出去”等标语。他们还号召伊兹密尔居民对前去活动的四千多名美国兵进行抵制。
    美国第六舰队在七月间就曾溜到土耳其的伊斯坦布尔、伊兹密尔港口活动，触发了席卷土耳其全国的大规模反美浪潮，示威群众愤怒高呼：“讨厌的美国佬，滚回去！”“第六舰队，滚蛋！”上岸活动的美国兵都象过街老鼠一样，到处挨揍，仅在伊斯坦布尔一地就有几十个美国兵被愤怒的群众打伤。设在土耳其首都安卡拉的许多美国侵略机构，如“国际开发署”、美国新闻处、泛美航空公司、土美银行等，也都被愤怒的群众用石头给砸了。这弄得美帝国主义非常狼狈，终于慌忙地把他们的军舰开走了。但是，事情刚过一个月，美国军舰死皮赖脸地又开到土耳其港口，妄想再来一次所谓“友好访问”。
    据报道，为了保证美国军舰这次活动的“成功”，美帝国主义者命令土耳其当局采取一切镇压措施，防止再度发生象上个月那样的大规模反美示威。在美国军舰开到的前一天，伊兹密尔市长甚至无耻地公开要求市民要对美国兵表示“友好和有礼貌”。可是，土耳其人民根本不理他们那一套，照样举行示威，喝令不受欢迎的美国第六舰队滚蛋。
