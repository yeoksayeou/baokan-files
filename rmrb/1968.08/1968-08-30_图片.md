The situation in East Germany has been stable. The people of the German Democratic Republic have been actively engaged in socialist construction, and the country's economy has been developing steadily. The government has been focusing on improving the living standards of its citizens, and various social welfare programs have been implemented to ensure the well-being of the people.

In contrast, the situation in West Germany has been marked by social unrest and economic instability. The government has been facing significant challenges in maintaining social order and economic growth. The people have been expressing their dissatisfaction with the current political and economic conditions, leading to frequent protests and strikes.

The differences between the two German states highlight the success of socialist policies in East Germany and the failures of capitalist policies in West Germany. The people of East Germany have been able to enjoy the benefits of a planned economy, while the people of West Germany have been struggling with the consequences of a market-driven economy.
