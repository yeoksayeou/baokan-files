Members of the Qingyun Commune Revolutionary Committee in Zhejiang Province continuously struggle against old ideas and habits, living and working with the masses to maintain the character of the working people.

The Qingyun Commune Revolutionary Committee in Zhejiang Province, following the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching to "trust the masses, rely on the masses, and respect the masses' spirit of initiative," has taken "struggle against selfishness and revise revisionism" as the key link. They have resolutely overcome old habits and forces, continuously swept away the dust of being detached from the masses, fully trusted and relied on the masses, and insisted on the mass line, making the Revolutionary Committee deeply rooted among the masses.

Qingyun Commune is located in the Tianmu Mountain area of western Zhejiang. In March of last year, it was one of the first communes in Zhejiang's countryside to establish a Revolutionary Committee. Over the past year, the Qingyun Commune Revolutionary Committee has shown great power in leading the revolution and production. Mao Zedong Thought has been widely propagated throughout the commune, the revolution has been deepened, agricultural production has reached a historical high, the collective economy has been consolidated and strengthened, and everywhere is a prosperous and thriving scene.

From Commanding to Consulting with the Masses

After the establishment of the Qingyun Commune Revolutionary Committee, it was the busy spring planting season, and the new leading cadre faced its first test: how to lead spring planting? After the members of the Revolutionary Committee went deep into the production front lines, most of them insisted on the mass line, mobilized the masses, and focused on the revolution and production. Revolutionary cadre representative Cai Wenren, due to the influence of old habits, went to the teams to focus on seeds, seedlings, and fertilizer. In meetings, he talked about numbers, quotas, and progress, and did little ideological and political work among the masses.

The revolutionary mass representatives in the Revolutionary Committee discovered these situations and believed that this was a major issue related to the revolutionary nature of the newly born Revolutionary Committee and its close ties with the masses, which must be well solved. At their suggestion, the Revolutionary Committee seriously studied Chairman Mao's teachings on trusting and relying on the masses. Cai Wenren, through study and everyone's enthusiastic help, found his shortcomings: he had not yet rooted Chairman Mao's teachings on the masses in his mind. He said: Chairman Mao teaches us, "The masses are the real heroes," "The people have limitless creativity." But I often regard myself as a hero, as Zhuge Liang, which is actually naive and laughable. He expressed his determination to follow Chairman Mao's words, consult with the masses more on matters, and be a student of the masses.

Cai Wenren's awareness improved, and his style changed. The masses reflected that he went from commanding more to consulting with the masses more, from educating the masses more to learning from the masses more, from talking more to listening to the masses' opinions more, and from focusing on specific production more to doing more ideological and political work. In the Tanglong team, he fully mobilized and relied on the masses to further carry out the "Learn from Dazhai in Agriculture" movement and summarized the experience of learning the Dazhai-style work-point system, which was promoted in all 100-plus production teams in the commune.

The members of the Revolutionary Committee unified their thoughts and actions. Everyone regarded the masses as the real heroes and themselves as students, insisting on the mass line and doing ideological and political work. They mobilized the masses to hold various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They mobilized the masses to focus on class struggle and carry out thorough revolutionary criticism. They further carried out the "Learn from Dazhai in Agriculture" mass movement throughout the commune. All these greatly promoted the thought revolutionization of the people and pushed agricultural production to a great development. The members of the Revolutionary Committee deeply felt through more than a year of struggle practice that Chairman Mao's teaching that "the most intelligent and most talented are the soldiers with the most practical experience" is extremely wise and correct. They said: As long as we trust the masses and rely on the masses, and arm the masses with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, we can create any miracle in the world.

Are We United in Thought or Just in Form?

Revolutionary Committee member and revolutionary cadre representative Zhang Cailin has been stationed in the Biling team, studying Chairman Mao's works with poor and lower-middle peasants, carrying out revolutionary criticism together, eating, living, and working together with them. The masses praised him, and he gradually became complacent, thinking he had united with the masses. However, one day, some members of the Biling team had a water dispute with a neighboring team, and he rushed over without saying a word, scolding a poor peasant harshly. The poor peasant felt wronged and questioned him: "Are you a cadre of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party?" This question sparked a fierce struggle in Zhang Cailin's mind. He couldn't sleep that night, thinking: In the past, when I was a leading cadre of the commune, I was detached from the masses, and the masses naturally had complaints about me. Now, I have achieved "five unities" with the masses and united with them, why do the poor peasant members still raise such sharp criticisms against me? He brought this question to study Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao teaches: "No matter how high one's position is, one must appear among the people as an ordinary laborer. One must not allow oneself to be arrogant." Chairman Mao's great teachings illuminated Zhang Cailin's heart. He found that although he had achieved "five unities" with the masses in form, he had not truly united with the masses in thought, still had the air of a superior, and had not regarded himself as an ordinary laborer, so he could not treat people equally. He followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "correcting mistakes once they are found" and publicly criticized his shortcomings. Then, he organized the relevant members to study Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and the brilliant works of the "Three Old Articles," and through in-depth and detailed ideological and political work, quickly resolved the water dispute.

Since this incident, the members of the Qingyun Commune Revolutionary Committee have further strictly required themselves in thought, striving to overcome old ideas and styles such as "officialdom" and "arrogance" in the "five unities," and truly unite with the masses in thought. Deputy Director of the Revolutionary Committee and former Deputy Director of the Commune Wu Kezhen, while stationed in the Shangxu team, found that this team had many mountain fields and poor water sources, so he consulted with the masses to build a reservoir, dig canals, and irrigate with water. He "both acted as an official and as a commoner," leading the masses to build water conservancy projects, and braved the biting cold to lead the way in digging canals and building dams. In the summer, he worked with the masses to fight drought, working day and night for more than 20 days until the drought was overcome, and he was so tired that he fell ill. Because he always thought of the masses' interests and shared their hardships, the masses praised him as a good cadre who wholeheartedly serves the people, educated by Chairman Mao.

Among the 15 members of the Qingyun Commune Revolutionary Committee, 8 revolutionary mass representatives and 1 team revolutionary cadre representative did not leave their original units' production labor; 6 full-time commune cadres had 5 stationed in teams for a long time. They all strove to change their thoughts and maintain the character of the working people in the "five unities" with the masses. This made the Revolutionary Committee deeply rooted among the masses and maintained a close relationship with them.

Are the Masses Supervising the Cadres or Are the Cadres Supervising the Masses?

After the members of the Qingyun Commune Revolutionary Committee generally went deep among the masses, they encountered a problem: how to deal with the masses' criticisms. Should they welcome the masses' criticisms, actively accept the masses' supervision, and let the masses supervise the cadres, or should they reject the masses' criticisms, place themselves above the masses, and supervise the masses as cadres? Revolutionary Committee members and revolutionary mass representatives Zhang Yulin and Hu Xixiang could connect with the masses and often brought the masses' opinions to the Revolutionary Committee, but they had resistance to the masses' criticisms of themselves, thinking that not being a cadre meant "managing" others, but being a cadre meant being "managed" by others, working hard, and still facing a lot of complaints, feeling unhappy. Facing these active thoughts, the leading members of the Revolutionary Committee organized everyone to seriously study Chairman Mao's teachings: "All our cadres, regardless of their position, are servants of the people. Everything we do is for the people. What bad things do we have that we are reluctant to give up?" Through the study, everyone's awareness improved, and they unanimously believed that the newly born Revolutionary Committee must represent the masses' interests, continuously listen to the masses' opinions and demands, continuously accept the masses' criticisms and supervision, and continuously change their thoughts and improve their work. The Revolutionary Committee followed Chairman Mao's great teaching of "to lead the revolutionary movement to develop and complete better and faster, we must rectify it thoroughly in terms of ideology and organization" and established the system of regular open rectification.

Now, six open rectifications have been carried out. Each time, poor and lower-middle peasant representatives were invited to fully express their opinions. The broad poor and lower-middle peasant representatives, with the attitude of loving and supporting the Revolutionary Committee, put forward many valuable opinions, criticisms, and suggestions. The Revolutionary Committee studied them one by one. They followed the attitude of "if you are right, we will correct it. If your method is good for the people, we will do it your way" and accepted all the opinions raised by the masses that conformed to Mao Zedong Thought. This played a significant role in the thought revolutionization of the Revolutionary Committee members and the continuous improvement of their work. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Dongshe and Shegan teams, the farthest from the commune, said that the Revolutionary Committee members rarely came to their teams. Three comrades of the Revolutionary Committee carried their bedding, took Chairman Mao's works, climbed mountains and crossed ridges to these two teams. They helped these two teams hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, focused on class struggle, and were praised by the masses.

In addition to regular open rectifications, the Qingyun Commune Revolutionary Committee also often actively seeks opinions from the masses in daily life, and each member consciously places himself under the masses' supervision. Many members can take the attitude of loving the Revolutionary Committee, often actively proposing criticisms and suggestions.

Over the past year since its establishment, the Qingyun Commune Revolutionary Committee has insisted on arming the masses with Mao Zedong Thought and insisting on the mass line, which has greatly mobilized the broad masses to seize the revolution and promote production. Last year, they overcame a historical drought of 130 days and achieved a bumper harvest. This year's summer grain production exceeded any previous year. Collective reserves increased significantly, and the collective economy rapidly expanded.

    浙江省青云公社革委会成员不断同旧思想旧习惯作斗争
    和社员同吃同住同劳动保持劳动人民本色
    本报讯　浙江省临安县青云公社革命委员会，遵循伟大领袖毛主席“要信任群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神”的伟大教导，以“斗私，批修”为纲，坚决克服旧的习惯势力，不断扫除脱离群众的灰尘，充分相信和依靠群众，坚持走群众路线，使革委会深深扎根于群众之中。
    青云公社位于浙西天目山区，去年三月就成立了革命委员会，是浙江农村最早建立革委会的公社之一。一年多来，青云公社革委会在领导革命和生产中，显示出强大的威力。毛泽东思想在全社空前大普及，革命不断深入发展，农业生产水平创造了历史最高纪录，集体经济空前巩固和壮大，到处是一片欣欣向荣的兴旺景象。
      由指手划脚多变为和群众商量多
    青云公社革委会成立以后，正是春耕大忙季节，新的领导班子面临着第一个考验，就是怎样去领导春耕生产？公社革委会成员深入生产第一线以后，大多数能坚持群众路线，放手发动群众，狠抓革命，猛促生产。革命干部代表蔡文人由于旧的习惯势力作怪，下队只抓种子、秧苗、肥料，开会就讲数字、指标、进度，向群众做思想政治工作很少。
    公社革委会中的革命群众代表发现这些情况以后，认为这是关系到新生的革委会实现革命化和密切联系群众的大问题，必须很好地解决。在他们建议下，革委会认真学习了毛主席关于相信群众和依靠群众的教导。蔡文人经过学习和大家的热情帮助，找到了自己的缺点，是还没有把毛主席教导的群众观点在自己头脑里生根。他说：毛主席教导我们：“群众是真正的英雄”、“人民群众有无限的创造力”。而我却往往把自己当作英雄，当作诸葛亮，实际上自己却往往是幼稚可笑的。他表示坚决听毛主席的话，遇事多和群众商量，当群众的小学生。
    蔡文人认识提高了，作风也改变了。群众反映他由指手划脚多变为和群众商量多，由教育群众多变为向群众学习多，由自己讲得多变为听取群众意见多，由抓具体生产多变为做思想政治工作多。他在畈垄大队充分发动和依靠群众，进一步开展“农业学大寨”运动，并总结了学习大寨式记工的经验，在全公社一百多个生产队全面推广。
    公社革委会成员思想统一了，行动也一致了。大家都把群众当作真正的英雄，把自己当作小学生，坚持走群众路线，坚持做思想政治工作。他们放手发动群众，大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，全面落实毛主席的最新指示。他们放手发动群众，狠抓阶级斗争，深入开展革命大批判。他们在全公社进一步开展了
  “农业学大寨”的群众运动。所有这些，大大促进了人的思想革命化，推动了农业生产大发展。公社革委会成员从一年多的斗争实践中，深刻地体会到：毛主席关于“最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士”的教导，无比英明，无比正确。他们说：只要相信群众，依靠群众，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装群众，什么人间奇迹也能创造出来。
  是思想上打成一片还是形式上打成一片？
    公社革委会成员、革命干部代表张才林，一直在碧淙大队蹲点，和贫下中农一起学习毛主席著作，一起开展革命大批判，吃在一起，住在一起，劳动在一起，群众对他有好评。他自己就逐渐满足起来，以为和群众打成一片了。可是有一次，碧淙大队的一些社员和邻队发生了水利纠纷，他跑去二话没说，就对一位贫农狠狠批评了几句。那位贫农感到很委屈，就质问他：“你是不是毛主席、共产党的干部？”这句话引起了张才林激烈的思想斗争。他一夜没有睡着，心想：我过去当公社领导干部时，脱离群众，群众自然对我有意见。现在，我和群众“五同”了，和群众打成一片了，为什么贫农社员还对我提出那么尖锐的批评？他带着这个问题请教毛主席著作。毛主席教导说：“任何人不论官有多大，在人民中间都要以一个普通劳动者的姿态出现。决不许可摆架子。”毛主席的伟大教导，照亮了张才林的心。他发现自己虽然和群众形式上做到“五同”了，但是思想上还没有真正和群众打成一片，还有高人一等的官气，还没有把自己看成是一个普通劳动者，所以还不能平等待人。他遵循毛主席的“有了错误，定要改正”的教导，公开检讨了自己的缺点。接着，他组织有关社员学习毛主席的《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》和“老三篇”等光辉著作，通过做深入细致的思想政治工作，很快解决了水利纠纷问题。
    从这件事以后，青云公社革委会的成员都从思想上更加严格要求自己，在“五同”中努力克服“官气”、“架子”等旧思想、旧作风，在“五同”中改造世界观，真正和群众打成一片。公社革委会副主任、原公社副社长吴克振，在上徐大队蹲点，发现这个大队山田多，水源差，就和群众商量修水库，开渠道，引水灌溉。他“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”，既领导群众修水利，又冒着刺骨冰雪，带头下水修渠筑坝。夏天，他和群众一道冒着炎热抗旱，白天干晚上也干，坚持劳动了二十多天，直到抗旱胜利了，他也累得病倒了。由于他处处为群众利益着想，和群众同甘共苦，群众赞扬他是毛主席教育出来的全心全意为人民服务的好干部。
    青云公社革委会十五名成员中，八名革命群众代表和一名大队革命干部代表，不脱离原单位的生产劳动；六名公社脱产干部有五名在大队、生产队长期蹲点，他们都在和群众“五同”中，努力改造思想，保持劳动人民的本色。这就使革委会深深扎根于群众之中，和群众保持了鱼水关系。
      是群众管干部还是干部管群众？
    青云公社革委会成员普遍深入群众以后，曾经碰到一个问题，就是如何对待群众的批评。是欢迎群众批评，主动接受群众监督，让群众管干部呢，还是拒绝群众批评，把自己置于群众之上，以干部身份去管群众呢？革委会成员、革命群众代表章玉林、胡锡璋能够联系群众，经常把群众的意见带到革委会，但是群众对自己的批评却有抵触情绪，认为不当干部是“管”别人，当了干部被人“管”，工作得很累，意见还一大堆，心里不服气。针对这些活思想，公社革委会领导成员组织大家认真学习了毛主席的教导：“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员，我们所做的一切，都是为人民服务，我们有些什么不好的东西舍不得丢掉呢？”通过学习，大家认识提高了，一致认为新生的革委会要代表群众的利益，就要不断地听取群众的意见和要求，不断地接受群众的批评和监督，不断地改造思想，改进自己的工作。革委会便遵循毛主席“为要领导革命运动更好地发展，更快地完成，就必须从思想上组织上认真地整顿一番”的伟大教导，建立了经常开门整风的制度。
    现在，已经进行了六次开门整风。每次都邀请贫下中农代表参加，发动他们充分地提意见。广大贫下中农代表本着爱护、支持革委会的态度，提出了许多宝贵的意见、批评和建议。革委会都一一作了研究。他们本着“只要你说得对，我们就改正。你说的办法对人民有好处，我们就照你的办”的态度，对群众提的意见凡是符合毛泽东思想的，就坚决接受。这对革委会成员实现思想革命化，不断改进工作，起了很大作用。离公社最远的东社和射干大队的贫下中农说，革委会成员很少到他们大队去，革委会的三位同志就背起铺盖，带上毛主席著作，爬山越岭来到这两个大队。他们帮助这两个大队办了毛泽东思想学习班，狠抓阶级斗争，受到了群众的赞扬。
    青云公社革委会除了定期开门整风以外，平时也经常在群众中主动征求意见，每个成员都自觉地把自己放在群众监督之下。许多社员都能以爱护革委会的态度，经常地积极地提出批评和建议。
    青云公社革委会成立一年多来，坚持用毛泽东思想武装群众，坚持走群众路线，这就大大调动了广大群众抓革命、促生产的积极性。去年战胜了历史上从来没有过的一百三十天大旱，获得了大丰收。今年夏粮产量，超过历史上任何一年。集体储备粮显著增加，集体经济迅速壮大。
