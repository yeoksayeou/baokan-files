In the midst of the great situation of the Cultural Revolution of the Proletariat, news has come from Heilongjiang Province that the vast number of poor and lower-middle peasants have achieved a bumper harvest of spring wheat. At present, the harvesting of spring wheat in Heilongjiang Province has basically been completed, and many regions are concentrating their efforts on threshing and shelling, and have begun to deliver new wheat to the state.

Heilongjiang Province is one of the main production areas for spring wheat in our country. In the great struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution of the Proletariat, the vast number of poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary workers of state farms in Heilongjiang Province, following the great teachings of Chairman Mao Zedong to "grasp revolution, promote production" and "must seize grain production," have vigorously carried out the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads, resolutely smashed the plots of a handful of class enemies to sabotage production, developed a great revolutionary situation, and promoted continuous development in production.

This year, many regions have suffered from consecutive natural disasters, but the vast revolutionary masses, with a spirit of conquering nature, have bravely fought against the heavens and the earth, and finally achieved a bumper harvest. The harvest in the main wheat-producing areas in the eastern part of Heilongjiang Province is even better than the bumper harvest of last year. The vast revolutionary masses enthusiastically acclaim this as a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought and a great achievement of the Cultural Revolution of the Proletariat.

During the wheat harvest, members of the revolutionary committees at all levels went to the front lines and fought shoulder to shoulder with the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary workers, pushing the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought to new heights. Each production brigade and team held Mao Zedong Thought study classes in the fields, carried out revolutionary criticism, and severely criticized the crimes of Liu Shaoqi in promoting "self-reliance, self-management, and self-sufficiency," "material incentives," and attempting to restore capitalism, making the wheat harvest work done quickly and well.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 15th: In the midst of the victory songs of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution of the Proletariat, under the great banner of Chairman Mao Zedong's "grasp revolution, promote production," the poor and lower-middle peasants and community members in Guangdong Province have overcome one difficulty after another and achieved a bumper harvest of early rice. The early rice yield in many counties, communes, and production brigades has exceeded that of the bumper harvest year of 1967. At present, the early rice harvesting work in various parts of Guangdong has been fully completed, and the vast number of poor and lower-middle peasants and community members are hurriedly carrying out the transplanting of late rice and the sowing of various late autumn crops, striving for a comprehensive increase in agricultural production this year.

Guangdong Province's early rice bumper harvest this year is the result of the vast number of poor and lower-middle peasants and community members, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, overcoming multiple major natural disasters. This early spring, the weather in the entire province was abnormal, with continuous cold waves and low temperatures and rain for more than a month, causing many seedlings to be frozen or rotted. Various places carried out several replantings, ensuring that the entire province completed the transplanting task on time without delay. From the beginning of June to the beginning of July, which is the period of grain filling and ripening for early rice, large areas in the northern, central, and eastern parts of Guangdong Province experienced continuous heavy rains and major floods. The vast number of poor and lower-middle peasants, remembering Chairman Mao's great teachings of "making a firm decision, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory," under the strong leadership of the revolutionary committees at all levels and the great support of the People's Liberation Army, bravely engaged in flood control and rescue efforts, and achieved great victory in this struggle. Most of the large and medium-sized dikes in the areas threatened by floods did not suffer major disasters, and the loss of crops was minimal, ensuring the bumper harvest of early rice in the main grain-producing areas of the province this year.

The vast number of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in Guangdong Province, in the movement of the Cultural Revolution of the Proletariat, closely united around the Proletarian Headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, earnestly implemented Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, grasped revolution, and vigorously promoted production. Therefore, despite encountering consecutive natural disasters, they still generally managed to meticulously manage the fields, apply fertilizer reasonably, and strive to increase the yield per unit area.

    用毛泽东思想武装群众　战胜各种自然灾害
    黑龙江春小麦和广东早稻夺得丰收
    据新华社哈尔滨十五日电　在无产阶级文化大革命的一派大好形势下，传来了黑龙江省广大贫下中农夺得春小麦丰收的喜讯。目前，黑龙江省春小麦收割工作已经基本结束，许多地区正集中力量抓紧打场脱粒，并开始向国家交售新麦。
    黑龙江省是我国春小麦主要产区之一。在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大斗争中，黑龙江省广大贫下中农、革命干部和国营农场的广大革命职工，遵循伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”、“必须把粮食抓紧”的教导，狠抓两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，坚决粉碎一小撮阶级敌人破坏生产的阴谋，发展了大好的革命形势，促进了生产的不断发展。
    今年，许多地区曾连续遭受自然灾害，但是广大革命群众，发扬人定胜天的革命精神，英勇地战天斗地，终于夺得了丰收。黑龙江省东部主要产麦区的收成，比大丰收的去年还好。广大革命群众热烈欢呼这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大成果。
    在麦收期间，各级革命委员会领导成员深入第一线，和贫下中农、革命职工并肩战斗，把活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动推向了新高潮。各社、队在田间大办毛泽东思想学习班，开展革命大批判，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫推行“三自一包”、“物质刺激”，大搞资本主义复辟的罪行，使麦收工作做得又快又好。
    据新华社广州十五日电　在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，在伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针指引下，广东省各地贫下中农和社员群众战胜了一个个的困难，夺得了早稻丰收。很多县、社、队的早稻产量超过了大丰收的一九六七年的早稻产量。目前，广东各地的早稻收割工作已全部结束，广大贫下中农和社员群众正加紧进行晚稻插秧和各项晚秋作物的播种工作，力争今年农业生产的全面增产。
    广东省今年早稻获得丰收，是毛泽东思想武装起来的广大贫下中农和社员群众战胜了多次特大自然灾害以后取得的。今年早春时节，全省天气反常，不断出现寒流，连续一个多月低温阴雨，秧苗被冻死和沤坏很多，各地普遍进行了几次补播，使全省仍然不误农时地完成了插秧任务。六月上旬至七月初，正是早稻灌浆结实时期，广东省的北部、中部和东部的大片地区，连续暴雨，出现特大洪水。广大贫下中农牢记毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的伟大教导，在各级革命委员会的坚强领导和人民解放军的大力支援下，英勇地投入防洪抢险斗争，并且取得了这一斗争的伟大胜利。受洪水威胁地区的绝大多数大、中堤围都没有出大险，农作物损失很小，保证了全省主要粮产区今年的早稻丰收。
    广东省广大贫下中农和革命干部在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，紧紧团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部周围，认真落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，狠抓革命，猛促生产。因此，尽管连续遇到自然灾害，他们在田间管理方面，还普遍做到精工细管，合理施肥，努力提高单位面积产量。
