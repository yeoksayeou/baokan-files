Albanian collective farmers, with the strong support of the country's young volunteers, are vigorously reclaiming new land and expanding the area under cultivation. In the first two and a half years of the Fourth Five-Year Plan, Albanian collective farmers have reclaimed over 51,500 hectares of new land. This means that the amount of new land reclaimed in this period is more than the total amount reclaimed during the entire Third Five-Year Plan. This year, 25,000 hectares will be reclaimed. By the end of the first half of the year, 62 percent of this year's plan has already been completed.

During this Five-Year Plan period, new land is mainly reclaimed from degraded forests and pastures in hilly and mountainous areas. The members of agricultural production cooperatives in these regions, with the help of members from plain region agricultural production cooperatives and urban youth, are undertaking this massive task. Tens of thousands of young volunteers have enthusiastically responded to the call of the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labor of Albania, displayed revolutionary heroism, and thrown themselves into this glorious cause. They have gone deep into remote mountainous areas, worked enthusiastically and joyfully with the cooperative farmers to expand the cultivated area, and have been well tempered in the process of labor.

    阿集体农民大力开垦新地
    数以万计青年热烈响应党的号召到山区参加劳动
    据新华社地拉那电　据阿尔巴尼亚通讯社报道：阿尔巴尼亚集体农民在全国青年义务劳动者的有力支援下，大力开垦新地，扩大耕地面积。在第四个五年计划头两年半，阿尔巴尼亚集体农民，已经开垦了五万一千五百公顷以上的新地。这就是说，这一期间开垦的新地比整个第三个五年计划期间开垦的新地还多。今年将开垦二万五千公顷。在上半年已完成了今年计划的百分之六十二。
    在这个五年计划期间，新地主要是从丘陵地和山地退化的森林和牧场开垦出来的。这些地区的农业生产合作社社员在平原地区农业生产合作社社员和城市青年的大力帮助下，从事这一巨大的任务。数以万计的青年义务劳动者热烈响应劳动党第五次代表大会的号召，发扬革命英雄主义精神，投入了这一光荣的事业。他们深入到遥远山区，同合作社农民一起愉快热情地劳动，扩大耕地面积，并在劳动中受到很好的锻炼。
