Workers, peasants, and students in several Latin American countries have been continuously engaged in struggles, protesting against political oppression and economic exploitation by their ruling classes.

In Chile, 100 workers at the Panos de Tome textile factory in the city of Concepcion occupied the factory on the 27th, demanding a wage increase. Workers at this factory have been on strike for over 100 days. In the city of Los Angeles, 1,300 workers at the Toro hydroelectric plant went on strike, protesting the authorities' refusal to pay overdue wages. On the 28th, dozens of agricultural workers in the province of Coquimbo occupied a farm, protesting the farm owner's attempt to dismiss agricultural workers without compensation, and demanding a wage increase.

In the important industrial city of Sao Paulo, Brazil, more than 1,000 students defied the reactionary government's ban on demonstrations and held a protest march on the 28th, protesting the unjust arrest of students. The demonstrators overturned two government cars and burned one of them. On the 26th, when reactionary police stormed the University of Sao Paulo to arrest students, the students bravely resisted the police's search, capturing some police as hostages, demanding the release of arrested comrades, and burning a police car. Previously, in cities such as Niteroi, Belo Horizonte, and Salvador, students held demonstrations and rallies against the military dictatorship. The students' placards read: "Down with the dictatorial regime!" "Release the arrested students and workers!"

In Peru, more than 3,000 peasants and their families from the province of Cusco began a long march to the provincial capital on the 26th, protesting the authorities' indifference to the plight of the disaster-stricken people. This region has suffered severe drought, resulting in crop failure and extreme poverty for the peasants. The marching peasants received support from other regions along the way, with many peasants joining their ranks.

Recently, hundreds of workers at the state-owned cold storage plant in Uruguay held a protest march, protesting the management's order to close the plant. Previously, more than 1,500 cold storage workers had occupied the state-owned cold storage plant and the Casablanca cold storage plant.

On the 27th, students at the School of Architecture in the city of La Plata, Argentina, held another protest march, protesting the authorities' unjust expulsion of students.

Since July, Mexican students have held a series of large demonstrations to oppose American colonialism and protest the police's brutal suppression of students.
