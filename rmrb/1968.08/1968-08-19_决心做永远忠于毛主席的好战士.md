In the joyous day of commemorating the second anniversary of Chairman Mao's first inspection of the Red Guards, my heart surges with emotion, and my blood boils with excitement. I can hardly contain my boundless joy and infinite happiness. I will never forget that most fortunate day when, on Tiananmen Rostrum, I saw our most beloved leader, the red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, whom we long to see. I was also honored to shake hands with Chairman Mao three times and to have my picture taken with Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin three times. This is not only my personal honor and happiness but also the honor and happiness of all Red Guards across the nation. Every time I recall this happy moment, I am filled with passion, tears welling up in my eyes, and I repeatedly shout, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years! I wish our red sun in the heart, Chairman Mao, eternal life! Eternal life!"

Chairman Mao is our supreme commander. The proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin is our sole leadership center. We are Chairman Mao's little red soldiers, his loyal warriors. We love Chairman Mao the most, and Chairman Mao loves the little red soldiers the most. Looking back on the two-year battle journey, I deeply feel that following the great leader Chairman Mao is happiness, following the great commander Chairman Mao is victory! Following the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, we are invincible and triumphant wherever we go!

Chairman Mao instructs me to act accordingly, and Chairman Mao waves his hand, I march forward. In the early days of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I responded to Chairman Mao's call and joined the Long March team to conduct on-foot connections. Wherever I went, I propagated Chairman Mao's instructions and, together with the poor and lower-middle peasants there, fiercely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev, such as the "three freedoms and one contract," "exploitation is meritorious," and "class struggle is extinguished." Soon, Chairman Mao issued the great call to "resume classes and make revolution." I followed Chairman Mao's instructions and immediately returned to school to resume classes and make revolution. In the stormy days of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I responded to Chairman Mao's call and threw myself into the political revolution against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes. In the most arduous moments of struggle, it was Chairman Mao who dispelled the layers of mist for us and pointed out the direction. In the face of severe tests, Chairman Mao gave us boundless strength and wisdom, enabling us to withstand the evil winds and waves and forever advance along the direction pointed out by Chairman Mao. No matter what the situation, as long as I think of the affectionate reception by the great leader Chairman Mao, my mind becomes clear, my will becomes firm, my courage becomes great, and my fighting spirit soars. On how many nights have I stood before Chairman Mao's portrait to make a pledge: Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Your little red soldier will definitely read your books, listen to your words, and act according to your instructions. I will be your good soldier, fighting to realize your revolutionary line in life and dedicating my life to defend your revolutionary line in death.

In response to Chairman Mao's call, I joined the People's Liberation Army to follow the path of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers. Now, I have become an honorable revolutionary soldier and stepped onto the battlefield of directly defending Chairman Mao. In this great school of Mao Zedong Thought, the People's Liberation Army, I, together with my comrades, engage in "struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism" to constantly reform our worldview and gradually deeply understand the importance of my work. I link my work with defending Chairman Mao and defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, resolutely ensuring that Chairman Mao's instructions are followed and the orders of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin are executed. Every time news comes of Chairman Mao receiving PLA cadres and soldiers and other revolutionary soldiers, or of Chairman Mao issuing new instructions, I, together with my classmates, quickly form a propaganda team, prepare programs, and go to colleges, factories, and neighborhoods to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions, enabling the broad revolutionary masses to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and achieve comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution.

Two years ago, when the great leader Chairman Mao received me, the respected Comrade Jiang Qing gave me very warm care. Comrade Jiang Qing said earnestly, "You must carry on your father's will." I will not disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations for our young generation and will surely remember Comrade Jiang Qing's care. Like my father, I will temper myself into a good soldier forever loyal to Chairman Mao. Forever under the wise leadership of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, I will dedicate my life to the revolution. I will forever be loyal to the supreme commander Chairman Mao, forever loyal to the great Mao Zedong Thought, forever loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, forever loyal to the Party, and loyal to the people. In actual struggles, I will actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism, break down selfishness and establish public spirit, actively participate in the great criticism of the revolution, constantly raise my class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness, and in the struggle to achieve comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution, create new merits for the people!

    决心做永远忠于毛主席的好战士
    毛主席的好学生焦裕禄同志的女儿、空军某部新战士  焦守云
    在纪念毛主席首次检阅红卫兵两周年的大喜日子里，我心潮澎湃，热血沸腾，抑制不住内心的无比喜悦和无限幸福的激情。我永远也忘不了，那最幸福的一天，在天安门城楼上，我见到了时刻想念的我们最伟大的领袖、心中最红的红太阳毛主席，我还光荣地三次和毛主席他老人家握手，三次和毛主席、林副主席在一起照像。这不仅是我个人的光荣和幸福，也是全国红卫兵的光荣和幸福。每次当我想起这幸福的时刻，我都激情满怀，热泪盈眶，一遍又一遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”“敬祝我们心中最红的红太阳毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”
    毛主席是我们的最高统帅，以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部是我们唯一的领导中心，我们是毛主席的红小兵，是毛主席的忠诚战士，我们最热爱毛主席，毛主席也最爱红小兵。回顾两年来的战斗历程，我深刻地体会到，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席就是幸福，紧跟伟大统帅毛主席就是胜利！紧跟以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，就所向披靡，无往而不胜！
    毛主席指示我照办，毛主席挥手我前进。无产阶级文化大革命初期，我响应毛主席的号召，参加了长征队，进行徒步串连。走到那里，就把毛主席的指示宣传到那里，就和那里的贫下中农一起狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的“三自一包”、“剥削有功”、“阶级斗争熄灭”论等反革命修正主义谬论。不久，毛主席发出“复课闹革命”的伟大号召，我遵照毛主席的指示，立即回校复课闹革命。在无产阶级文化大革命的急风暴雨中，我响应毛主席的号召，投入了反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命。在斗争最艰苦的时刻，是毛主席给我们拨开层层迷雾，指明方向；在严峻的考验面前，毛主席给我们以无穷的力量和智慧，使我们顶住了妖风恶浪，永远沿着毛主席指引的方向不断前进。不论在任何情况下，只要一想起伟大领袖毛主席的亲切接见，我就心明眼亮意志坚，胆大劲足斗志昂。有多少个夜晚我站在毛主席像前表决心：毛主席啊，毛主席！您的红小兵，一定读您的书，听您的话，照您的指示办事，做您的好战士，生为实现您的革命路线战斗，死为捍卫您的革命路线献身。
    为了响应毛主席的号召，走同工农兵相结合的道路，我参加了人民解放军。现在，我已成了一名光荣的革命战士，走上了直接保卫毛主席的战斗岗位。在人民解放军这所毛泽东思想大学校里，我和同志们一起“斗私，批修”，不断改造世界观，逐步深刻地懂得了我所担任的工作的重要性。我把我的工作和保卫毛主席，保卫毛主席的革命路线紧紧联系起来，坚决做到：毛主席的指示坚决照办，以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的号令件件执行。每当传来毛主席接见解放军干部战士与其他革命战士的特大喜讯和毛主席发出了最新指示时，我就和班里的同志一起迅速成立宣传队，一起编节目，到大专院校和工厂、街道宣传毛主席的最新指示，使广大革命群众紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，夺取文化大革命的全面胜利。
    两年前，在伟大领袖毛主席接见我的时候，敬爱的江青同志给了我十分亲切的关怀。江青同志语重心长地说：“你要继承爸爸的遗志。”我一定不辜负毛主席对我们青年一代的期望，一定牢记江青同志的关怀，象我爸爸那样，把自己锻炼成为永远忠于毛主席的好战士。永远在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的英明领导下干一辈子革命。我要永远忠于最高统帅毛主席，永远忠于伟大的毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的革命路线，永远忠于党，忠于人民。在实际斗争中活学活用毛泽东思想，斗私批修，破私立公，积极参加革命的大批判，不断提高自己的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟，在夺取文化大革命全面胜利的斗争中，为人民立新功！
