The great proletarian cultural revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, has now reached a crucial moment for achieving comprehensive victory. This cultural revolution has ensured that the socialist state founded by Chairman Mao will remain unchanged for generations to come, and it has safeguarded the poor and lower-middle peasants from suffering a second round of hardships. With hearts filled with immense excitement and joy, we poor and lower-middle peasants shout: Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years of life to Chairman Mao!

Two years ago today, the great commander Chairman Mao issued his "Bombard the Headquarters" big-character poster. This powerful poster was a call to arms against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, led by China's Khrushchev, and it was a great call to action for the revolutionary masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers to rise up and seize power from these capitalist roaders!

Chairman Mao's words are the truth. Following Chairman Mao's words is victory. It was under Chairman Mao's wise leadership that we poor and lower-middle peasants united to fight against the local tyrants and divide the land, overthrowing the landlords and bullies who had oppressed us, and thus we stood up! Later, Chairman Mao led us to organize cooperatives and walk the socialist path to common prosperity. We poor and lower-middle peasants followed Chairman Mao, listened to his words, formed mutual aid teams and cooperatives, and established the "one big, two public" people's communes. It was Chairman Mao who supported us poor and lower-middle peasants, allowing us to seize the reins of power and achieve a thorough liberation in both politics and economics! However, China's Khrushchev, the biggest capitalist roader within the Party, and his agents in various places, waved the red flag to oppose the red flag, created counter-revolutionary public opinion, and did everything they could to dismantle the collective economy, attempting to restore capitalism in our rural areas, allowing the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists to return to power and oppress us poor and lower-middle peasants again, making us suffer twice. In response to the call of our great leader Chairman Mao, we poor and lower-middle peasants launched a decisive attack against China's Khrushchev and his agents in various places. After repeated struggles, we finally defeated these bad elements, seized back the party, government, financial, and cultural powers they had usurped, and established revolutionary committees at all levels composed of "three-in-one" combinations. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought! This is a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

Chairman Mao is our poor and lower-middle peasants' savior. Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline. We will resolutely carry out and implement Chairman Mao's instructions! We will resolutely carry out and implement the instructions of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin! All instructions from Chairman Mao and the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin represent the fundamental interests of the broad revolutionary masses. We will defend Chairman Mao to the death, defend Mao Zedong Thought to the death, defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to the death, and defend the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin to the death. We will definitely carry the great proletarian cultural revolution through to the end. We will definitely follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao to "grasp revolution, promote production." We will grasp the revolution firmly and promote production vigorously, continue to deeply and persistently carry out the great criticism, expose and criticize all the counter-revolutionary revisionist trash spread by China's Khrushchev and his agents in various places; at the same time, we will channel our boundless revolutionary enthusiasm into production, determined to achieve a bumper harvest this year, and make new contributions to the comprehensive victory of the great proletarian cultural revolution.

　　听毛主席的话就是胜利
　全国农业劳动模范、山东省贫下中农代表会筹委会负责人　张富贵
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，已经进入了夺取全面胜利的关键时刻。这次文化大革命，保住了毛主席奠基的社会主义江山千秋万代永不变色，保住了我们贫下中农不再遭受二茬罪。我们贫下中农怀着无比激动、无比兴奋的心情高呼：毛主席万岁！万万岁！
    两年前的今天，伟大统帅毛主席《炮打司令部》的大字报发表了。这张威力无比的大字报，是向以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派夺权的进军号，是号召我们无产阶级革命派和广大工农兵群众起来造党内一小撮走资派的反，夺他们权的伟大战斗动员令！
    毛主席的话是真理，听毛主席的话就是胜利。我们贫下中农就是在毛主席的英明领导之下，团结起来打土豪分田地，斗倒了骑在俺们头上的地主恶霸，从此翻了身！以后，毛主席又领导我们组织起来，走共同富裕的社会主义光明大道。我们贫下中农紧跟毛主席，听毛主席的话，办互助组、合作社，又办起了“一大二公”的人民公社。是毛主席给我们贫下中农撑腰，我们贫下中农才掌握了印把子，才在政治上、经济上彻底翻了身！可是，中国赫鲁晓夫这个党内最大的走资派及其在各地的代理人，却打着红旗反红旗，制造反革命舆论，千方百计拆集体经济的台，妄图在我国农村复辟资本主义，好让地富反坏右重新上台，骑到我们贫下中农的头上，叫我们再受二遍苦，重遭二茬罪。我们贫下中农坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召，向中国赫鲁晓夫及其在各地的代理人发起了总攻击。经过反复较量，终于把这一小撮坏蛋打翻在地，夺回了被他们篡夺了的那部分党政财文大权，建立了“三结合”的各级革命委员会，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利！
    毛主席是我们贫下中农的救命恩人，毛泽东思想是我们贫下中农的命根子。毛主席的指示，我们坚决照办，坚决执行！以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的指示，我们坚决照办，坚决执行！毛主席的一切指示，以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的一切指示，都代表了我们广大革命群众的根本利益。我们誓死保卫毛主席，誓死保卫毛泽东思想，誓死保卫毛主席的革命路线，誓死保卫以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，一定要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。我们一定遵照伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的教导，狠抓革命，猛促生产，继续深入持久地开展革命大批判，把中国赫鲁晓夫及其在各地代理人散布的一切反革命修正主义黑货，揭深揭透，批倒批臭；同时，把冲天的革命干劲用到生产上去，誓夺今年农业大丰收，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利立新功。
