The Guinean military delegation, led by Vice Chief of the General Staff of the Guinean National People's Army, Colonel Kamara Diaby, concluded their friendly visit to our country and departed by airplane this morning.

Representatives from various departments and branches of the People's Liberation Army, the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, and relevant departments, including Wang Xinting, Zhang Lingbin, and Ding Xilin, along with hundreds of soldiers and officers from the army, navy, and air force, as well as Beijing's militia and Red Guards, gathered at the airport to bid a warm farewell to the Guinean guests.

The welcoming crowd held high portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao and President Sekou Toure, along with large banners reading "Warmly send off the Guinean military delegation" and "Long live the friendship between the peoples of China and Guinea." At the Beijing airport, they enthusiastically welcomed their Guinean friends. Accompanied by Vice Chief of the General Staff of the People's Liberation Army Wang Xinting and others, the Guinean friends bid farewell to the welcoming crowd. The crowd beat drums and gongs, enthusiastically shouting slogans such as "Firmly support the just struggle of the Guinean people against imperialism and colonialism," "Firmly support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries," "Down with American imperialism," "Down with modern revisionism," and "Long live the great Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought!" Colonel Kamara Diaby waved the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to the welcoming crowd.

The Chargé d'Affaires of the Guinean Embassy in China, Kamara, as well as diplomats from several countries and military attachés from various embassies in China, also came to the airport to see them off.

During their stay in Beijing, the Guinean military delegation visited and toured the Beijing Military Region of the People's Liberation Army and the Beijing Cotton Mill No. 2, among other factories. Wherever the delegation went, they were warmly welcomed by the soldiers and revolutionary workers of the People's Liberation Army. After visiting the troops, Colonel Kamara Diaby said, "We have seen the new level you have reached through training with Mao Zedong Thought, and your high political awareness. You understand for whom you are fighting based on Mao Zedong Thought, which has left a deep impression on us." After visiting the Beijing Cotton Mill No. 2, he said, "We will follow Chairman Mao's teachings: 'Self-reliance, clothing and food in abundance,' and carry on the anti-imperialist struggle to the end." He said, "Through this visit, we have come to know each other better and strengthened the unity and friendship between our two peoples and armies in the struggle against our common enemy—imperialism led by the United States." He said, "I wish you greater achievements in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao, and long live Chairman Mao!"
