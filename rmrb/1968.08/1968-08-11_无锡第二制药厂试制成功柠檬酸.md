The revolutionary workers of Wuxi Second Pharmaceutical Factory in Jiangsu have broken free from the constraints of foreign dogma and outdated frameworks, successfully producing the new product citric acid in just a few months.

Citric acid is an essential raw material for both the pharmaceutical and food industries. Three years ago, the workers of Wuxi Second Pharmaceutical Factory repeatedly proposed to trial-produce citric acid. However, under the constraints of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line promoted by Khrushchev and his agents, and the obstruction of some reactionary "technical authorities" within the factory, the workers' enthusiasm was suppressed.

In the stormy winds of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionary faction of this factory seized the leadership from the hands of the walking capitalists and ousted the bourgeois reactionary "technical authorities" who controlled the factory's technical leadership. At this time, many workers and technical personnel promoted from among the workers, under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," once again proposed to trial-produce citric acid. As soon as this proposal was made, it received the firm support of the proletarian revolutionary faction throughout the factory. They established a citric acid trial production group composed of workers and cadres of worker origin and immediately began the trial production work. They followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "resolving to overcome all difficulties and win victory" and used jars and pots to replace foreign equipment, and held "Zhuge Liang meetings" with workers to collectively brainstorm solutions. In this way, after repeated trials, they finally successfully produced citric acid recently.

### 无锡第二制药厂试制成功柠檬酸

　　无锡第二制药厂试制成功柠檬酸
    江苏无锡第二制药厂革命职工冲破洋教条和旧框框的束缚，只用几个月时间就制成了新产品柠檬酸。
    柠檬酸是医药工业和食品工业所需要的重要原料。早在三年前，无锡第二制药厂的工人群众就多次提出要试制柠檬酸，但是在中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人推行的反革命修正主义路线的束缚下，在厂里的一些反动技术“权威”的阻挠下，工人的积极性被压下去了。
    在无产阶级文化大革命的急风暴雨中，这个厂的无产阶级革命派从走资派手中夺回了领导大权，并且把控制全厂技术领导权的资产阶级反动技术“权威”赶下了台。这时候，许多工人和从工人中提拔的技术人员，在伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针指引下，又重新提出了要试制柠檬酸。这件事一提出，就得到全厂无产阶级革命派的坚决支持。他们成立了由工人和工人出身的干部参加的柠檬酸试验小组，并且立即着手试制工作。他们遵照毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，没有洋设备就用坛坛罐罐代替，没有图纸就同工人一道召开“诸葛亮会”，群策群力，共同想办法。就这样，经过反复试验，终于在最近把柠檬酸成功地试制出来了。
