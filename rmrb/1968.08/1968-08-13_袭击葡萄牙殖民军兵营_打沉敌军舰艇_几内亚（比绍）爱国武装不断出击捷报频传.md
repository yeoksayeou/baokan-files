Guinea-Bissau patriotic armed forces have recently been continuously attacking Portuguese colonial army camps and sinking enemy warships on rivers, achieving many new victories.

According to a battle report issued by the Guinea-Bissau patriotic armed forces in Conakry, on June 19, the patriotic armed forces launched a powerful attack on the Portuguese colonial army's Mansoa camp, destroying part of the colonial army's command center in Mansoa camp and almost all the barracks that made up this stronghold. In this battle, more than 30 colonial soldiers were killed.

Before this, on June 8, a unit of the patriotic armed forces attacked the Portuguese army's Sitole camp, destroying three barracks in this camp and killing eight enemy soldiers, wounding several others. Another assault team attacked the colonial army's Bra camp on June 14, killing the guard.

On June 4, the patriotic armed forces attacked an enemy unit attempting to advance on the Bra-Ko road, killing three enemy soldiers, including a lieutenant. On June 10, near Mansaba, they ambushed an enemy column, killing four enemy soldiers and wounding nine. On the same day, the patriotic armed forces ambushed an enemy column twice as it attempted to advance between Olosato and Bisora, killing and wounding eight enemy soldiers. On June 11, the enemy landed by helicopter between Bra and Ko to carry out terrorist activities. The patriotic armed forces pursued the enemy into the jungle for two days, killing five enemy soldiers and wounding several others.

In recent times, the Guinea-Bissau patriotic armed forces have strengthened their attacks on colonial army warships and vessels in the northern and southern rivers, sinking and damaging fifteen colonial army ships of various types, including two gunboats and several speedboats. These victories not only caused the colonial army to suffer heavy losses in material and personnel but also further isolated some of the colonial army's important camps that mainly rely on river transport for supplies, making their supply situation increasingly difficult.

On June 14, an assault team of the patriotic armed forces attacked a river transport convoy supplying the Portuguese garrison on the Buda River, three kilometers from the Buda camp, sinking one speedboat, one motor barge, and one flat-bottomed barge. All personnel of the enemy transport convoy were annihilated, and the only surviving sailor was captured. On June 20, a unit of the patriotic armed forces ambushed an enemy transport convoy near Farim on the Kancolin River, sinking two enemy speedboats.

In April and May, the patriotic armed forces captured a total of 21 enemy soldiers.

　　袭击葡萄牙殖民军兵营　打沉敌军舰艇
　　几内亚（比绍）爱国武装不断出击捷报频传
    新华社科纳克里十二日电　几内亚（比绍）（编者注：前称“葡属”几内亚）爱国武装力量最近不断袭击葡萄牙殖民军的兵营，在河道上打沉敌军舰艇，取得了许多新胜利。
    据几内亚（比绍）爱国武装力量在科纳克里发表的战报宣布，六月十九日，爱国武装力量对葡萄牙殖民军的曼苏瓦军营发起强大袭击，摧毁了曼苏瓦军营的殖民军司令部的一部分和构成这个据点的防御体系的几乎所有的营房。在这次战斗中，打死殖民军三十多人。
    在这以前，爱国武装力量的一支部队在六月八日袭击了葡军锡托莱军营，摧毁了这个军营的三个营房，打死敌军八人，打伤数人。另一支突击队在六月十四日袭击了殖民军布拉兵营，打死了卫兵。
    六月四日爱国武装力量袭击一支企图在布拉—科公路上前进的敌军部队，打死敌军三人，其中有一名中尉。六月十日，在曼萨巴附近伏击敌军一个纵队，打死敌军四人，打伤九人。同一天，爱国武装力量两次伏击企图在奥洛萨托和比索拉之间前进的敌军一个纵队，打死打伤敌军八人。六月十一日，敌军乘直升飞机在布拉和科之间着陆进行恐怖活动，爱国武装力量追击钻入丛林的敌军达两天，打死敌军五人，打伤数人。
    几内亚（比绍）爱国武装力量，最近一个时期在北部和南部的河道上加强了对殖民军舰艇、船只的袭击，用火箭筒和重型武器击沉、击伤殖民军各型船只十五艘，其中包括两艘炮艇和几艘快艇。这些胜利不仅使殖民军在物质上和人员上遭受重大损失，而且进一步孤立了殖民军的一些主要靠河运补给的重要兵营，使这些兵营的给养日益困难。
    六月十四日，爱国武装力量一支突击队在布达河上距布达兵营三公里的地方袭击了一支向葡萄牙驻军运送给养的河上运输队，击沉快艇、机驳船和平底驳船各一艘。敌军运输队人员全部被歼灭，没有死的一名水手也被俘虏。六月二十日，爱国武装力量一支部队在康科林附近的法林河上伏击一支敌军运输队，击沉敌军快艇两艘。
    四月和五月，爱国武装力量共俘虏敌军二十一人。
