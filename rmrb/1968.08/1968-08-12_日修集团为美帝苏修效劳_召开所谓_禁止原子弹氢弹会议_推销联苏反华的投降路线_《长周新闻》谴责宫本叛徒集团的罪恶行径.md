The Japanese Revisionist Group Serves the U.S. Imperialists and Soviet Revisionists

Holds So-Called "Conference to Ban Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs" to Peddle the Line of Surrender and Collaboration with the Soviets Against China

*Long Week News* Condemns the Heinous Acts of the Traitorous Group Led by Miyamoto

	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 10th, Tokyo: The so-called "Conference to Ban Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs," controlled and manipulated by the Miyamoto revisionist group of the Japanese Communist Party, concluded on the 9th after holding an "International Preparatory Meeting," a "Tokyo General Meeting," and conferences in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

	During this ten-day conference, a small clique of Japanese Communist Party revisionists, as they did last year, used the banner of "comprehensive prohibition of nuclear weapons" to peddle the black goods of so-called "united action," making the conference continue to serve the line of surrender and betrayal of the Japanese revisionists in collaborating with the Soviets against China.

	This conference was held at a time when the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys, the Soviet revisionists, are facing internal and external difficulties and are further tightening their counter-revolutionary collusion on a global scale. The treacherous faces of the Miyamoto group, who pretend to be anti-American but are actually pro-Soviet, have been more thoroughly exposed. To steal the honor of the previous conferences to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs and to deceive the Japanese people, the Miyamoto group forcibly named this year's "Conference to Ban Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs," which they manipulated, as the "14th World Conference to Ban Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs." However, this is the Miyamoto group's third consecutive year, after 1966 and 1967, of disrupting the conference's anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist traditions and imposing their line of collaborating with the Soviets, flattering the Americans, and opposing China on the conference.

	On August 3, at the "Tokyo General Meeting," the head of the Japanese revisionists, Yoshio Nosaka, delivered a speech that is a revolutionary confession of the Japanese revisionists' line of collaborating with the Soviets, flattering the Americans, and opposing China. In his speech, Nosaka did not mention the Soviet revisionists' collusion with the U.S. imperialists and the splitting of the movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs but instead advocated for "united action" with the Soviet revisionists, who are the main accomplices of the U.S. imperialists in the Vietnam issue.

	The "General Report" presented by the representative of the "Japanese Conference to Ban Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs," Chokyu Sakuma, and the report by the leader of the Japanese delegation, Yoshitaro Hiran, both eagerly peddled the black goods of the so-called "united action" advocated by the Japanese revisionists, serving the line of the Japanese revisionists in collaborating with the Soviets, opposing China, and surrendering and betraying. They did not dare to expose and condemn the serious crimes of the U.S. imperialists in their mad "containment" of China, nor did they dare to expose and condemn the counter-revolutionary global collusion between the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionists in concocting the so-called "Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons," a great conspiracy and fraud. Instead, they actively served as the running dogs of the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionists in strengthening their alliance against China, against communism, against the people, and against revolution.

	In his report, Hiran parroted the Soviet revisionists' counter-revolutionary tune, frantically advocating so-called "unity" and viciously attacking socialist China, which upholds principles and raises the banner of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism. In his "General Report," Sakuma also maliciously attacked the foreign representatives and Japanese leftist representatives who, in 1966, maintained the conference's anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist traditions and were forced to withdraw from the conference, saying that their insistence on not including the Soviet revisionists and their lackeys in the "World Conference to Ban Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and International United Action" brought many obstacles and difficulties to the "unified development" of the movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs manipulated by the Japanese revisionists. This once again exposed the shameful face of the Japanese Communist Party revisionists who insist on being against the people, closely collude with the Soviet revisionists, and betray the revolutionary interests of the Japanese and world peoples.

	The Miyamoto group's despicable acts have been firmly opposed by the Japanese people. The progressive Japanese newspaper *Long Week News* recently published an article pointing out that the Miyamoto group, in the movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs, forced the so-called "independent and autonomous" counter-revolutionary and anti-people line into it, thereby destroying the traditions and achievements of the movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs that the Japanese people have established and gained through struggle over the past decade.

	*Long Week News* severely condemns the Miyamoto group's heinous acts of serving the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionists in the movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs.

　　日修集团为美帝苏修效劳
　　召开所谓“禁止原子弹氢弹会议”推销联苏反华的投降路线
    《长周新闻》谴责宫本叛徒集团的罪恶行径
    据新华社十日讯　东京消息：由日共宫本修正主义集团控制和操纵的所谓“禁止原子弹氢弹会议”，在举行了“国际预备会议”、“东京全体会议”和广岛、长崎大会后，已在九日收场。
    在这次为期十天的会议期间，操纵会议的一小撮日共修正主义分子，同去年一样，打着“全面禁止核武器”的招牌，推销所谓“联合行动”的黑货，使会议继续为日修的联苏反华、投降叛卖路线服务。
    这次会议是在美帝及其帮凶苏修面临着内外交困的窘境，进一步在全世界范围加紧反革命勾结；宫本集团的假反美、真联苏的反革命叛徒嘴脸更加大暴露的情况下举行的。宫本集团为了窃取历届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会的荣誉和欺骗日本人民，硬把它操纵的今年的“禁止原子弹氢弹会议”叫做“第十四届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会”。但是，这是宫本集团继一九六六和一九六七年之后又一次破坏大会的反帝、反修传统，把它的联苏媚美反华的路线强加给大会的分裂会议。
    日修头目野坂参三，八月三日在“东京全体会议”上的“致词”，是日修推行联苏媚美反华路线的一篇反革命自白书。野坂在“致词”中只字不提苏修勾结美帝、分裂禁止原子弹氢弹运动，却一味鼓吹在越南问题上同美帝的头号帮凶苏修搞“联合行动”。
    “日本禁止原子弹氢弹协议会”代表佐久间澄向会议提出的“总报告”和日本代表团团长平野义太郎在会上所作的“报告”，都竭力地推销日修鼓吹的所谓“联合行动”的黑货，为日修的联苏反华、投降叛卖路线服务。他们根本不敢揭露和谴责美帝疯狂地“遏制”中国的严重罪行，而且也根本不敢揭露和谴责美帝和苏修进行反革命全球勾结，合谋炮制所谓“防止核扩散条约”的大阴谋、大骗局，从而积极为美帝苏修加强反华、反共、反人民、反革命的联盟效犬马之劳。
    平野在“报告”中鹦鹉学舌似地操着苏修的反革命腔调，拚命地鼓吹所谓“团结”，并且疯狂地攻击坚持原则、高举反帝反修旗帜的社会主义中国。佐久间在他的“总报告”中还恶毒地攻击一九六六年为维护大会反帝反修传统，因而被迫退出大会的外国代表和日本左派代表，说他们坚持不把苏修及其帮凶“包括在世界禁止原子弹氢弹大会和国际统一行动中”，给日修操纵的禁止原子弹氢弹运动的“统一发展带来了不少障碍和困难”。这就再一次暴露了日共修正主义分子坚持与人民为敌，紧密勾结苏修，出卖日本和世界人民的革命利益的可耻面目。
    宫本集团的这些卑鄙行径，遭到了日本人民的坚决反对。日本进步报纸《长周新闻》最近发表文章指出，宫本集团在禁止原子弹氢弹运动中，把美其名为“独立自主”的反革命、反人民的路线硬塞进去，从而破坏了日本人民十几年来通过斗争建立起来的禁止原子弹氢弹运动的传统和所取得的成果。
    《长周新闻》严厉谴责宫本集团在禁止原子弹氢弹运动中极力为美帝苏修效劳的罪恶行径。
