In the midst of the nation's jubilant celebration of the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the People's Commune, we visited the Dazhai Brigade of Dazhai People's Commune in Xiyang County, Shanxi Province.

The Dazhai Brigade is a red flag raised by our great leader Chairman Mao. "Learn from Dazhai in agriculture" is Chairman Mao's great call. The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Dazhai told us that Dazhai's achievements today are not due to the heavens or the earth, but to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They said that in the great storms of class struggle, by studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions, they are invincible!

The red flag of Dazhai is raised with Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon in the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines.

Those who go to Dazhai first see the great changes in the village, land, and natural environment. Because they have treated the mountains and gullies and extensively processed the land, the average yield per mu has increased from about 200 jin during the individual farming period and over 400 jin during the cooperative period to over 900 jin today. In recent years, they have sold 200,000 to 300,000 jin of surplus grain to the state each year. Most community members, who used to live in dark and low mud houses, have gradually moved into spacious and bright new homes. The phenomenon of shortage of food and clothing has become a thing of the past. In short, what people see here is a new village, new houses, new land, and good production and construction. This is the result of Dazhai people's long-term struggle against nature.

How did the Dazhai Brigade ensure that it followed the socialist direction and achieved victory in the great struggle against nature? What is their fundamental experience?

The people of Dazhai said that their fundamental experience is to use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, to take the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines as the key, and to fight against people. They said that by grasping this point, they ensured the socialist direction and ensured the victory of production and construction.

The people of Dazhai fight against people by relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to fight against class enemies, to fight against the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, and to fight against the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes. Through struggle, they overthrow class enemies; in struggle, they transform the worldview of the broad masses of community members, and use Mao Zedong Thought to cultivate a new type of socialist-conscious peasants.

The Dazhai Brigade Party Branch believes that establishing this concept of "struggle" is very important. They say: Revolution is about class struggle. The proletarian revolution is to eliminate the exploiting class, to eliminate the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting class, and to use the new ideas, new culture, new customs, and new habits of the proletariat to change the spiritual face of the entire society. Chairman Mao teaches us: "All reactionary things, if you do not fight them, they will not fall. 'Without destruction, there can be no construction.' 'Correct things always develop in the struggle against incorrect things.' Therefore, revolution is about struggle, revolution is struggle. To think of making a revolution comfortably without struggle is false revolution. Against class enemies, only struggle can defeat them; against the ideas of the exploiting class, only struggle can eliminate them; against bad things, only struggle can turn them into good things. The dialectics of revolution is to make old things perish and new things emerge and develop through struggle. Against class enemies, against the old ideas of the exploiting class, not to struggle is to surrender to them, not to struggle is to be unable to fully liberate the creative power of the broad masses, unable to fully demonstrate the superiority of the socialist economy, and unable to complete the socialist revolution.

It is precisely because the Dazhai Brigade Party Branch has such a clear understanding under the brilliant light of the great Mao Zedong Thought that they lead the community members to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, build a new Dazhai with Mao Zedong Thought, and most prominently reflect this in the word "struggle": struggle against class enemies, struggle against the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, struggle against the old ideas and old habits of the exploiting class, and advance in struggle. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai say: New Dazhai is struggled out in the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines. The spirit of Dazhai is the spirit of continuously carrying out revolutionary struggle under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought.

Under the leadership of the Party Branch, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai Brigade firmly adhere to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, follow the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, and in the process of advancing, they have experienced severe class struggles.

The question of which road to take is the focus of the struggle.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the peasant masses, for thousands of years, it has been individual economy, with one family as one production unit. This scattered individual production is the economic foundation of feudal rule, which makes the peasants themselves fall into eternal poverty. The only way to overcome this situation is to gradually collectivize; and the only way to achieve collectivization, according to what Lenin said, is through cooperatives." "As for agriculture, the socialist road is the only road for Chinese agriculture." "People's communes are good." The poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai, from their own experience, have determined that the road indicated by Chairman Mao is the road to brightness. Under the leadership of the Dazhai Party Branch, they decided to advance in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao. However, they encountered suppression and attacks from a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party, who represented the interests of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the bourgeoisie, and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, led by the Chinese Khrushchev. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai, with Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, resolutely fought against this small clique of class enemies who attempted to promote capitalism, and advanced victoriously on the socialist road in the struggle.

In 1951, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai, following Chairman Mao's indication of the socialist direction, requested to establish an agricultural production cooperative on the basis of several years of mutual aid teams. At this time, the Chinese Khrushchev issued a black directive, slandering the poor and lower-middle peasants' request to establish a cooperative as "utopian agricultural socialism thought," as "wrong" and "dangerous." As a result, Dazhai's request to establish a cooperative was rejected. In the winter of 1952, they firmly requested to establish a cooperative again, but the capitalist-roaders within the Party struck them hard: a mutual aid team of 49 households was only allowed to establish a small cooperative of 30 households. This mutual aid team was led by Comrade Chen Yonggui to fight against the rich peasants and was initially only 9 households. Because it showed the superiority of organization, the number of poor and lower-middle peasants joining the team increased year by year, and every household wanted to join the cooperative. The "decision" to only allow a small cooperative of 30 households was neither in line with the direction indicated by Chairman Mao nor in line with the wishes of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants. The Dazhai Party Branch determined that it was wrong and resolutely resisted this decision, establishing a large cooperative of 49 households on their own, and the entire mutual aid team took the road of agricultural collectivization.

After establishing the cooperative, there was another struggle in the management direction. Landlords and rich peasants attempted to lead the cooperative astray, secretly spreading: "If you want to get rich quickly, add commerce to agriculture." Those influenced by this idea thought that the purpose of establishing a cooperative was to get rich, and to get rich, one should do whatever makes money. They wanted to make money by any means. The Dazhai Party Branch led the poor and lower-middle peasants to resolutely criticize this capitalist idea, pointing out that the poor and lower-middle peasants wanted socialism and could not adopt capitalist means to get rich and become wealthy. Taking the capitalist road would only make the poor and lower-middle peasants perpetually poor. At that time, the grain yield of Dazhai had increased significantly. In addition to completing the state's grain procurement task, there was still a lot of surplus grain. These surplus grains, if sold on the market, could bring in a lot of money. However, the Dazhai Party Branch stipulated that even if there was surplus grain, not a single grain could be sold on the market, and all of it should be sold to the state.

The struggle over which road to take was the most intense in the two to three years after 1960. At this time, the small clique of the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party, led by the Chinese Khrushchev, took advantage of the opportunity of consecutive natural disasters and temporary difficulties in the national economy to spread the evil wind of "three selfs and one contract," attempting to destroy the socialist collective economy and restore capitalism in one go. After 1961, for a period of time, the capitalist-roaders within the Xiyang County Committee even personally went to the Dazhai Commune to take charge, spreading the wind of individual farming and speculation, vigorously promoting the contract responsibility system to households, openly encouraging class enemies to engage in black-market trading and high-price business. At that time, the Dazhai Party Branch remembered Chairman Mao's teachings of "only socialism can save China" and "people's communes are good," leading the broad poor and lower-middle peasants to fight against class enemies in a head-on struggle. The leading members of the Party Branch used every platform to propagate socialism, criticize capitalism, and set an example for the poor and lower-middle peasants in action. At that time, this brigade of about 80 households had an annual grain procurement task of 80,000 jin. In the period when the national economy was temporarily difficult due to consecutive natural disasters, they, in the situation where their own grain rations were not very high, increased the amount of grain sold to the state from tens of thousands of jin in 1959 to 240,000 jin. They actively helped brother brigades develop socialist collective production and consolidate the collective economy by voluntarily giving their limited fertilizer to brother brigades. Class enemies and some people with spontaneous capitalist tendencies secretly raised the price of fodder to two or three jiao per jin, but the Dazhai Brigade sold it to brother brigades at a low price of five fen per jin. They resolutely opposed speculation and did not sell a single jin of high-priced grain, a single jin of high-priced grass, or any high-priced item. Their actions struck the enemy, educated the masses, and made people see what socialism is, what capitalism is, who is promoting socialism, and who is promoting capitalism. It played a great role in mobilizing the broad poor and lower-middle peasants of the entire commune and county to rise up and fight against the current of attempting to restore capitalism led by the Chinese Khrushchev.

The Dazhai Brigade Party Branch led the poor and lower-middle peasants to faithfully execute Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, firmly walk the socialist road indicated by Chairman Mao, and made a small clique of class enemies hate them to death. A small clique of class enemies fired openly and shot secretly, only wanting to cut down the red flag of Dazhai. In 1957, Dazhai and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements around Dazhai, taking advantage of the rightists' fierce attack on the Party, fiercely attacked Dazhai. The Dazhai Party Branch led the poor and lower-middle peasants to fight back resolutely and defeated the enemy's attack. In 1964, the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party, led by the Chinese Khrushchev, came to attack Dazhai again.

The Chinese Khrushchev, who attempted to restore capitalism, put forward the pseudo-leftist, rightist bourgeois reactionary line in 1964. The small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Shanxi Provincial Committee, Jinzhong Regional Committee, and Xiyang County Committee followed the baton of the Chinese Khrushchev, creating the fallacy of "the more advanced the place, the more it should be suspected." They sent a so-called "powerful" work team to attack Dazhai in the name of carrying out the "Four Clean-ups." Shortly after this work team arrived in Dazhai, they seized the leadership of the Dazhai Party Branch. The cadres of Dazhai did not engage in speculation or embezzlement, and they could not find any charges against them, so they distorted right and wrong, falsely accusing Dazhai of "self-determined policies," etc. The Dazhai Brigade Party Branch, which held high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, led the poor and lower-middle peasants to use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to fight resolutely against them, refuting the work team question by question. Comrade Chen Yonggui confronted the responsible person of the work team and asked: "Is your line correct, or is our line correct?" He asked him to the point of speechlessness. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, resisted this work team. The work team could not hold meetings or talks, and their activities could not proceed. Once the "Twenty-three Articles" drafted under the leadership of Chairman Mao were issued, this work team had to pack up and leave.

While leading the poor and lower-middle peasants to use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to smash the class enemies' attacks again and again, the Dazhai Brigade Party Branch also led the masses to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, using Mao Zedong Thought to transform the peasants' worldview and vigorously promote the ideological revolution of the people.

For a long time, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents also advocated building a "socialist new countryside." Their so-called "socialist new countryside" is good production and good life, having money and goods, in short, being rich. They used the trick of waving the red flag to oppose the red flag to advocate this set of ideas, aiming to make cadres and the masses forget class struggle, forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, forget socialism, and only focus on production, thinking of ways to make money, ultimately disarming them ideologically, making them lose their sense of smell and vision, and then it would be easy to restore capitalism.

The Dazhai Brigade Party Branch firmly remembered Chairman Mao's great teaching of "the serious problem is to educate the peasants," resolutely resisted the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies spread by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, and resolutely led the community members to learn from the People's Liberation Army and take the road of emphasizing proletarian politics, vigorously promoting the ideological revolution of the people, and using Mao Zedong Thought to cultivate a new generation of peasants with high socialist consciousness.

The Dazhai Brigade Party Branch led the community members to carry out ideological revolutionization by using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to fight against the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits cultivated by the exploiting class for thousands of years. They firmly grasped the fundamental task of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizing the word "use," using it to firmly grasp class struggle and to break private interests and establish public interests. The method is to continuously carry out class education, arouse the boundless love and loyalty of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants for Chairman Mao, learn with class feelings; cadres take the lead in learning and using; when encountering problems, first see what Chairman Mao instructs, and solve them according to Chairman Mao's teachings; use Mao Zedong Thought to occupy all positions, even changing the old content in aspects such as celebrating the New Year, festivals, singing, watching operas, and educating children. They especially regarded the exploitative class's "harmony is precious" rotten idea as a great enemy to be eliminated. In this way, whoever sees something not in line with Mao Zedong Thought will consciously fight against it, making the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting class hit a wall everywhere.

In our country, after the establishment of the socialist collective economy, there is a contradiction between the advanced socialist collective ownership economy and the bourgeois "self" in people's minds. In the face of this contradiction, the management of the socialist collective economy should be more and more conducive to eliminating the bourgeois "self" in people's minds and promoting the establishment of a public-spirited ideology that matches the public ownership economy. However, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Shanxi did the opposite. In order to restore capitalism, they used every means to stuff the revisionist black goods of "economic leadership" and "material incentives" into the management of the socialist collective economy, attempting to expand private thoughts and undermine the socialist collective economy.

The agents of the Chinese Khrushchev in Shanxi implemented a set of extremely cumbersome specific methods in the labor management of the people's commune collective economy. This set of labor management methods, which waved the red flag to oppose the red flag, stimulated people to calculate personal gains and losses, stimulated people to work for work points, "work points are the lifeline"; it induced people not to emphasize proletarian politics, to cheat and take advantage in labor, and not to pay attention to quality; it encouraged cadres to think from the bourgeois "self," as if the "self" is the driving force of the revolution, hurting the "self" is hurting the masses' enthusiasm; it made cadres spend all day in cumbersome management work, unable to participate in collective production labor, alienating them from the masses; it destroyed the unity between the masses and the masses, and between the masses and the cadres; it led people to only care about their own small affairs, forgetting the big affairs of class struggle.

Because a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party painted a layer of red color on this set of labor management methods, its reactionary essence was not easily exposed. The Dazhai Brigade also implemented this set of methods for a period of time. However, the more it was used, the more problems arose. The Dazhai Brigade Party Branch used Chairman Mao's teaching that "political work is the lifeline of all economic work" to measure, and found that this set of management methods did not conform to Mao Zedong Thought at all. Therefore, they mobilized the masses to use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to criticize this set of methods, and at the same time, they mobilized the masses to firmly fight against the bourgeois "self" in their minds. Since 1960, they simply smashed this set of cumbersome labor management methods and, after several years of continuous exploration, created the current management system of "working for the public, reporting and discussing work points." This system emphasizes proletarian politics, uses Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, and solves the contradiction between the socialist collective public ownership economy and the "self" in people's minds by overthrowing the bourgeois "self" and establishing the proletarian "public." It greatly promotes the consolidation and development of the socialist collective economy.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "People's social existence determines people's thoughts. And the correct thoughts representing the advanced class, once grasped by the masses, will become the material force to transform society and the world." The Dazhai Brigade has only about 130 labor forces, but because the people of Dazhai have armed their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, they rely on those hoes and shovels, without external aid, to build so many houses, repair so much land, build so many ditches, treat so many mountains, and gradually increase grain production. The people of Dazhai say: With Mao Zedong Thought in their minds, they have more enthusiasm, more methods, and more courage. Everyone thinks and works consciously, and this power is immeasurable.

The key to the people of Dazhai being able to use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, firmly grasp the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, and continuously win victories in the struggle is that the Dazhai Brigade Party Branch is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The Dazhai Brigade Party Branch, with infinite loyalty to Chairman Mao, uses Mao Zedong Thought to observe everything, discern everything, guide everything, and transform everything. When they lead the masses to use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to fight against class enemies and the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting class, they adopted the following methods:

(1) Cadres should take the lead in revolution. Comrade Chen Yonggui said: "To forge iron, one must first be hard oneself. Revolution must first revolutionize oneself." To "revolutionize oneself," the Dazhai Brigade Party Branch stipulated: Cadres are the organizers of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, but they must first be models of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. According to the Party Branch's regulations, the cadres of the Dazhai Brigade lead the masses to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, first applying Mao Zedong Thought to themselves. The cadres of Dazhai pay the most attention to class education, but first, they conduct class education on themselves. Through recalling bitterness and sweetness, they always remember the past bitterness, always remember today's sweetness, always remember their roots, always remember class struggle, always remember the dictatorship of the proletariat, and always walk the socialist road. The cadres of Dazhai believe that as revolutionary cadres, in personal matters, they should not have more of anything, but should have more Mao Zedong Thought, more awareness of executing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and more spirit of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people. Therefore, they serve as cadres without extra work points, work more than others, labor harder than others, and enjoy less than others. They engage in revolution with a clear direction, great enthusiasm, and when encountering things not in line with Mao Zedong Thought and not in line with Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, they consciously fight against them and resolutely fight against them.

(2) Fully mobilize the masses and organize a strong class force. Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Revolutionary war is the war of the masses. Only by mobilizing the masses can the war be carried out, and only by relying on the masses can the war be carried out." The Dazhai Brigade Party Branch believes that fully mobilizing the masses and organizing a strong class force is the need of class struggle. They criticized the reactionary fallacy of "relying on whoever has the ability" that does not follow the class line, armed the poor and lower-middle peasants with Mao Zedong Thought, and organized a class force with the poor and lower-middle peasant activists as the backbone under the leadership of the Party Branch. With this force, the instructions of Chairman Mao can be fully implemented, and the policies of the Party can be carried out; with this force, the masses can be mobilized, led, and united to fight against class enemies; with this force, there is strength in class struggle, and victory can be achieved.

(3) Follow Chairman Mao's teachings to correctly handle the two types of contradictions. The Dazhai Brigade Party Branch believes that in the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, class enemies must be overthrown; for some people's wrong thoughts that belong to the contradictions within the people, they must also be fought against. The purpose of the fight is to help the masses liberate themselves from the old thoughts long instilled by the exploiting class and unite on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought to jointly fight against the enemy. In fighting against the wrong thoughts within the masses, the Dazhai Brigade Party Branch strictly follows Chairman Mao's instructions of "unity - criticism and self-criticism - unity," focusing on presenting facts and reasoning, and conducting persuasive education. In Dazhai, reasoning mainly involves reasoning about class struggle, arousing the class consciousness of the masses. Reasoning is done by everyone, guiding the masses to educate themselves.

(4) In the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, raise the political consciousness of the community members. The Dazhai Brigade Party Branch believes that struggle is a school and a classroom. Through class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, promote the community members to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, raise the community members' understanding of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, which is better than any other class. Therefore, they do not consider the class enemies' attacks as absolutely bad things in class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, because they can raise the consciousness of the poor and lower-middle peasants from class struggle. The poor and lower-middle peasants of the Dazhai Brigade have the ability to firmly grasp class struggle, which is tempered in the practice of struggle.

The Dazhai Brigade of Dazhai People's Commune in Xiyang County, Shanxi Province, has a strong leadership team that is closely connected with the masses and revolutionized. Over the past ten years, they have firmly adhered to the socialist direction by relying on the poor and lower-middle peasants in the struggle to consolidate and develop the people's commune, fully carrying forward the revolutionary spirit of hard work and self-reliance, overcoming numerous difficulties, and making the collective economy more prosperous. They have become a shining flag on the agricultural front of our country. After being tempered by the fiery Cultural Revolution, the ideological revolutionization of the cadres of the Dazhai Brigade has reached a new height. They follow the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao and are determined to lead the heroic people of Dazhai to achieve new victories in the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution!

    狠抓阶级斗争，在社会主义道路上阔步前进！
    ——记大寨大队以毛泽东思想为武器坚持革命斗争的战斗经历
    在举国欢呼“人民公社好”，欢庆实现人民公社化十周年的大喜日子里，我们访问了山西省昔阳县大寨公社大寨大队。
    大寨大队是我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自树立起来的一面红旗，“农业学大寨”，是毛主席的伟大号召。大寨大队的贫下中农和革命干部告诉我们，大寨之所以有今天，不靠天，不靠地，靠的是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。他们说，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，坚持活学活用毛泽东思想，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，就无往不胜！
        大寨这面红旗是以毛泽东思想为
    武器，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条
    路线斗争中斗出来的
      到大寨去的人，首先看到的是大寨的村庄、土地、
  自然环境发生了巨大变化。因为治了山治了沟，大搞土地加工，粮食平均亩产量已由单干时的二百来斤、合作化时的四百多斤提高到现在的九百多斤，这几年每年都有二十多万斤到三十多万斤余粮交售给国家。过去世世代代只能住又矮又暗的破土窑的绝大多数社员，近几年已经陆续住上了宽敞明亮的新居，缺吃少穿的现象已经成为历史的陈迹。总之，人们在这里看到的是新村、新房、新土地，是生产建设搞得好。这是大寨人长期以来和天斗、和地斗的结果。
    大寨大队是怎样保证按照社会主义方向，在战天斗地的伟大斗争中不断获得胜利的呢？他们的根本经验是什么？
    大寨人说，他们的根本经验，是以毛泽东思想为武器，以两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争为纲，和人斗。他们说，抓住了这一条，就保证了社会主义方向，就保证了生产建设的胜利。
    大寨大队的和人斗，就是依靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，和阶级敌人斗，和中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线斗，和资产阶级以及一切剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯斗。通过斗争打倒阶级敌人；在斗争中改造广大社员的世界观，用毛泽东思想培育具有高度社会主义觉悟的新型农民。
    大寨大队党支部认为树立这个“斗”的观念很重要。他们说：革命就是搞阶级斗争。无产阶级革命就是要消灭剥削阶级，消灭剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，用无产阶级自己的新思想、新文化、新风俗、新习惯来改变整个社会的精神面貌。毛主席教导我们：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。”
  “不破不立。”“正确的东西总是在同错误的东西作斗争的过程中发展起来的。”所以，革命就是要斗，革命就是斗争，想舒舒服服，没有斗争地闹革命，那是假革命。对阶级敌人，只有斗，才能把他打倒；对剥削阶级思想，只有斗，才能把它消灭；对坏事，只有斗，才能变成好事。革命的辩证法就是通过斗争使旧的东西灭亡，使新的东西产生和发展。对阶级敌人，对剥削阶级的旧思想，不斗，就等于向他投降，不斗，就不可能充分解放广大群众的创造力，不可能充分发挥社会主义经济的优越性，就不能完成社会主义革命。
    正是由于大寨大队党支部在伟大的毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉照耀下有这样明确的认识，所以，他们带领社员活学活用毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想建设新大寨，最突出的是表现在一个“斗”字上：和阶级敌人斗，和中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义路线斗，和剥削阶级的旧思想、旧习惯斗，在斗争中前进。大寨的贫下中农说：新大寨就是在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争中斗出来的，大寨精神就是在毛泽东思想指导下永不停止地进行革命斗争的精神。
      坚持毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，
    在斗争中前进
    大寨大队的贫下中农在党支部的领导下，坚持毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，按照毛主席指引的方向，在前进的过程中，经历了严峻的阶级斗争。
    走什么道路的问题，是斗争的焦点。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“在农民群众方面，几千年来都是个体经济，一家一户就是一个生产单位，这种分散的个体生产，就是封建统治的经济基础，而使农民自己陷于永远的穷苦。克服这种状况的唯一办法，就是逐渐地集体化；而达到集体化的唯一道路，依据列宁所说，就是经过合作社。”“就农业来说，社会主义的道路是我国农业唯一的道路。”“人民公社好”。大寨的贫下中农，从自己的切身经历中，认定毛主席指引的道路是光明大道，他们在大寨党支部的领导下，决心按照毛主席指引的方向前进，但是，却遇到了代表国民党反动派、资产阶级和地、富、反、坏、右利益的以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派的压制和打击。大寨的贫下中农以毛泽东思想为武器，同这一小撮妄图大搞资本主义的阶级敌人进行了坚决的斗争，在斗争中沿着社会主义道路胜利前进。
      一九五一年，大寨的贫下中农遵照毛主席指出的
  社会主义方向，在办了几年互助组的基础上，要求办
  农业生产合作社。正在这时候，中国赫鲁晓夫却发来
  一道黑指示，诬蔑贫下中农要求办农业社是“空想的
  农业社会主义思想”，是“错误的”、“危险的”。结果，
  大寨贫下中农的办社要求被打回来了。一九五二年冬，
  他们又坚决要求办社，但党内走资派却向他们狠狠地
  砍来一刀：一个四十九户的大互助组，只准办成一个三十户的小社。这个互助组，是陈永贵同志领头和富裕中农作斗争办起来的，最初只有九户，因为它显示了组织起来的优越性，几年中入组的贫下中农越来越多，户户都要求转社。只准办三十户小社的这个“决定”，上不符毛主席指示的方向，下不合广大贫下中农的要求，大寨党支部认定它是错了，就坚决抵制了这个决定，自己办了个四十九户的大社，全互助组统统走上了农业合作化的道路。
      办了社，在经营方向上又经历了一场斗争。地、富分子妄图把合作社引上邪路，在暗地里散布：“要想发财快，庄稼加买卖。”受这种思想影响的人就认为，办社是为了富，要富，当然是那一行赚钱干那一行。他们想不择手段地搞赚钱的事。大寨党支部领导贫下中农坚决批判了这种资本主义思想，指出贫下中农要的是社会主义，不能采取资本主义的手段发财致富，走资本主义道路只会使贫下中农永远受穷。当时，大寨的粮食产量已经提高了很多，除了完成国家粮食征购任务以外，还有不少余粮，这些余粮只要拿到市场上出卖，就能得到大把大把的钱。但是，大寨党支部规定，有了余粮，一颗也不能上市场，统统卖给国家。
    走什么道路的斗争，在一九六○年以后的两、三年内最激烈。这个时候，以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮最大的走资派，趁连续遭受三年自然灾害，国民经济发生暂时困难的时机，大刮“三自一包”的妖风，想一下把社会主义集体经济摧垮，复辟资本主义。一九六一年以后一个时期，昔阳县委内的走资派竟亲自到大寨公社坐镇，大刮单干风和投机倒把风，拚命地推行包产到户，明目张胆地鼓励阶级敌人搞黑市买卖，做高价生意。当时，大寨党支部牢记毛主席的“只有社会主义能够救中国”和“人民公社好”的教导，领导广大贫下中农同阶级敌人进行了针锋相对的斗争。党支部的领导成员利用一切讲台，宣传社会主义，批判资本主义，并且在行动上给贫下中农做榜样。当时，这个八十来户的大队，一年粮食征购任务是八万斤，在由于连续遭受三年自然灾害国家经济暂时困难的时期，他们为了支援国家的社会主义建设，在自己口粮还不是很高的情况下，一下把交售给国家的粮食数量，从一九五九年的十几万斤提高到二十四万斤。他们为了帮助兄弟队发展社会主义集体生产，巩固集体经济，主动把自己不多的一点化肥让给兄弟队。阶级敌人和一些有资本主义自发倾向的人，当时暗地里把喂牲口的谷草价格哄抬到两三角钱一斤，大寨大队却以五分钱一斤的低价卖给兄弟队。他们坚决反对投机倒把，不卖一斤高价粮，不卖一斤高价草，不卖任何一样高价的东西。他们的行动，打击了敌人，教育了群众，使人们看清了什么是社会主义，什么是资本主义，谁在搞社会主义，谁在搞资本主义，对动员全公社、全县广大贫下中农起来和中国赫鲁晓夫掀起的妄图复辟资本主义的逆流作斗争，起了很大作用。
    大寨大队党支部领导贫下中农忠实地执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，坚定地走毛主席指引的社会主义道路，使一小撮阶级敌人恨得要死。一小撮阶级敌人放明枪，射暗箭，只想把大寨这面红旗砍倒。一九五七年，大寨和大寨周围的地富反坏分子，趁资产阶级右派向党猖狂进攻之际，大反大寨，大寨党支部领导贫下中农进行坚决的斗争，打垮了敌人的进攻。一九六四年，以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派又来砍大寨了。
    妄图复辟资本主义的中国赫鲁晓夫，在一九六四年抛出了形“左”实右的资产阶级反动路线。山西省委、晋中地委和昔阳县委内的一小撮走资派跟着中国赫鲁晓夫的指挥棒转，制造了所谓“越是先进的地方越要怀疑”的谬论，派一个号称“强大”的工作队，以搞“四清”为名去砍大寨。这个工作队来到大寨不久，就夺了大寨党支部的领导权。大寨的干部一不投机倒把，二不多吃多占，他们找不出什么罪名来，就颠倒黑白，硬说什么大寨的地亩不对，产量不实，无理指责大寨是“自定政策”，等等。高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的大寨大队党支部，领导贫下中农，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，坚决地和他们斗，一个问题一个问题把工作队驳倒。陈永贵同志面对面地质问工作队的负责人：“你们的路线对，还是我们的路线对？”把他问得张口结舌。用毛泽东思想武装起来的大寨贫下中农抵制这个工作队，工作队找人开会开不成，找人谈话谈不了，活动也活动不开。毛主席主持制定的“二十三条”一下达，这个工作队就只好背起行李走路了。
    大寨大队党支部在领导贫下中农，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，粉碎了阶级敌人一次又一次进攻的同时，还领导群众活学活用毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想改造农民的世界观，狠抓人的思想革命化。
      长期以来，中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人也鼓吹建设
  “社会主义新农村”，他们所谓的“社会主义新农村”，就是生产好、生活好，就是有钱、有物，一句话，就是富。他们用打着“红旗”反红旗的伎俩鼓吹的这一套，目的是为了使干部和群众忘记阶级斗争，忘记无产阶级专政，忘记社会主义，只是单纯抓生产，想方设法去弄钱，最后从思想上解除武装，变得鼻子不灵，眼睛不明，他们就好复辟资本主义了。
    大寨大队党支部牢记毛主席“严重的问题是教育农民”的伟大教导，坚决抵制了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人散布的那一套反革命修正主义谬论，坚决领导社员大学解放军，走突出无产阶级政治的道路，狠抓人的思想革命化，用毛泽东思想培育一代有高度社会主义觉悟的新型农民。
      大寨大队党支部领导社员搞思想革命化，就是以毛泽东思想为武器，和几千年来剥削阶级培植的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯斗。他们紧紧抓住活学活用毛泽东思想这个根本，突出一个“用”字，用在狠抓阶级斗争上，用在破私立公上。办法就是不断进行阶级教育，激发广大贫下中农对毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚的无产阶级感情，带着阶级感情学；干部带头学，带头用；碰到问题先看毛主席是怎么指示的，按照毛主席的教导去解决；用毛泽东思想占领一切阵地，连过年、过节、唱歌、看戏、教育孩子方面的旧内容也统统改了。他们特别是把剥削阶级的“和为贵”的腐朽思想当成一大敌人来加以消灭，这样，谁见了不符合毛泽东思想的事，就自觉起来斗，使剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯到处碰壁。
    在我国，社会主义集体经济建立起来以后，先进的社会主义集体公有制经济和人们头脑中的资产阶级
  “私”字之间存在着矛盾。在这个矛盾面前，社会主义集体经济的经营管理，应该是越来越有利于消灭人们头脑中的资产阶级“私”字，促进与公有制经济相适应的一心为公的思想的建立。但是，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在山西的代理人却与此相反，他们为了复辟资本主义，千方百计把“经济挂帅”、“物质刺激”那一套修正主义黑货塞进社会主义集体经济的经营管理中去，妄图借以扩大私有思想，瓦解社会主义集体经济。
    中国赫鲁晓夫在山西的代理人，在人民公社集体经济的劳动管理上就搞了一套极为烦琐的具体办法。这套打着“红旗”反红旗的劳动管理办法，刺激人斤斤计较个人得失，刺激人为工分而劳动，“工分就是命根子”；它引诱人不突出无产阶级政治，在劳动中投机取巧，不讲质量；它鼓励干部从资产阶级“私”字出发想问题，好象“私”字是革命的动力，伤害了“私”字，就是伤害了群众的积极性；它把干部成天陷在烦琐的管理工作中，不能参加集体生产劳动，脱离群众；它破坏群众和群众、群众和干部之间的团结；它引导人只顾眼前个人的小事，忘记阶级斗争的大事。
    因为党内一小撮走资派给这一套劳动管理办法涂上了一层红颜色，它的反动实质一下子不容易被人识破，大寨大队也实行过一段时间。但是越用，问题越多。大寨大队党支部用毛主席的“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的教导来衡量，发现那一套管理办法根本不符合毛泽东思想。于是，他们发动群众，以毛泽东思想为武器，对那套办法进行了批判，同时发动群众狠斗自己头脑中的资产阶级“私”字，从一九六○年起干脆砸烂了那一套烦琐的劳动管理办法，又经过几年不断摸索，创造出了现在实行的“一心为公劳动，自报公议工分”的管理制度。这套制度突出无产阶级政治，用毛泽东思想挂帅，以打倒资产阶级“私”字，树立无产阶级“公”字的办法，解决了社会主义集体公有制经济和人们头脑里的“私”字之间的矛盾，大大促进了社会主义集体经济的巩固和发展。
    毛主席教导我们：“人们的社会存在，决定人们的思想。而代表先进阶级的正确思想，一旦被群众掌握，就会变成改造社会、改造世界的物质力量。”大寨大队就那么一百三十多个劳动力，但是，由于大寨人用毛泽东思想武装了头脑，就靠那么些镢头、铁锹，不要外援，盖了那么多房，修了那么多地，闸了那么多沟，治了那么多山，粮食产量得到了步步提高。大寨人说：头脑里有了毛泽东思想，干劲也来了，办法也多了，胆子也大了，人人动脑筋，人人自觉干，这个威力估
  不透。
        大寨大队党支部是坚强的革命的
    战斗指挥部
    大寨人之所以能够以毛泽东思想为武器，狠抓两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，并在斗争中不断赢得胜利，关键是大寨大队党支部无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。大寨大队党支部怀着对毛主席的无限忠诚，用毛泽东思想去观察一切，鉴别一切，指导一切，改造一切。他们领导群众以毛泽东思想为武器向阶级敌人，向剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯展开斗争时，采取了以下一些做法：
      （一）干部要带头革命。陈永贵同志说：“打铁先得本身硬，革命先革自己的命。”为了“革自己的命”，大寨大队党支部规定：干部是活学活用毛泽东思想的组织者，但首先要做活学活用毛泽东思想的模范。按照党支部的规定，大寨大队的干部领导群众活学活用毛泽东思想，先把毛泽东思想用在自己身上。大寨的干部最重视阶级教育，但是首先是对自己进行阶级教育。他们通过忆苦思甜，使自己永远不忘过去的苦，永远不忘今日的甜，永远不忘本，永远不忘阶级斗争，永远不忘无产阶级专政，一心走社会主义道路。大寨的干部认为，当革命干部，在个人的事上什么也不应该多，只应该多一点毛泽东思想，多一点执行毛主席革命路线的自觉性，多一点“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的精神。因此，他们当干部，不要补贴工分，工作比别人多，劳动比别人累，享受比别人少。他们干革命，方向明，干劲大，遇到不符合毛泽东思想的事，不符合毛主席革命路线的事，就自觉地起来斗争，坚决地斗争。
      （二）充分发动群众，组织一支坚强的阶级队伍。伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”大寨大队党支部认为，充分发动群众，组织一支坚强的阶级队伍，是阶级斗争的需要。他们批判了“谁有本事就靠谁”的不讲阶级路线的反动谬论，用毛泽东思想武装贫下中农，组织起一支在党支部领导下的以贫下中农积极分子为骨干的阶级队伍。有了这支队伍，毛主席的指示就能全面落实，党的政策就能贯彻执行；有了这支队伍，就能发动群众、带动群众、团结群众向阶级敌人作斗争；有了这支队伍，在阶级斗争中就有力量，就能打胜仗。
      （三）遵照毛主席的教导，正确处理两类不同性质的矛盾。大寨大队党支部认为，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争中，对于阶级敌人，必须把他打倒；对于属于人民内部矛盾的一些人的错误思想，也要斗，斗的目的是帮助群众从剥削阶级长期灌输的旧思想中解放出来，在毛泽东思想的基础上团结起来，共同对敌。和群众中的错误思想作斗争，大寨大队党支部严格按照毛主席的“团结——批评和自我批评——团结”的指示办事，着重摆事实，讲道理，进行说服教育。在大寨，讲道理，主要是讲阶级斗争的道理，启发群众的无产阶级觉悟。讲道理，是大家讲，引导群众自己教育自己。
      （四）在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争中，提高社员的政治觉悟。大寨大队党支部认为，斗争是学校，是课堂。通过阶级斗争和两条路线斗争，促进社员活学活用毛泽东思想，提高社员对阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的认识，比上什么课都强。因此，他们在阶级斗争和两条路线斗争中，不是把阶级敌人斗倒就算完事，而是通过斗争提高社员的无产阶级政治觉悟。从这点来说，大寨大队党支部不把阶级敌人的进攻看成是绝对的坏事，因为可以从阶级斗争中来提高贫下中农的觉悟。大寨大队的贫下中农狠抓阶级斗争的本事，就是他们在斗争实践中锻炼出来的。
