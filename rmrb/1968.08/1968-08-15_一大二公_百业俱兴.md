The article titled "China's Khrushchev" claimed that the people's commune was established "too early" and "failed miserably." The Qi Licheng People's Commune has refuted this malicious slander with ironclad facts. Over the past ten years since its establishment, the commune has faced seven years of natural disasters, some of which were unprecedented. However, due to the advantages of the people's commune's "unity and public ownership" and the organizational power of the integration of political and communal affairs, the commune has overcome various natural disasters and class enemy sabotage. Production has greatly developed, and the yield per unit area of grain and cotton has increased several times compared to before the establishment of the commune. Commune-run industries and small factories in production brigades have sprouted like bamboo after a spring rain. Agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries have all developed comprehensively. Public accumulation has increased from thirty-some ten thousand yuan before the establishment of the commune to over seven hundred seventy ten thousand yuan. The living standards of the people have also improved significantly.

Before the establishment of the commune, the water conservancy issue in Qi Licheng was not well resolved from mutual aid teams to elementary cooperatives to advanced cooperatives. After the establishment of the commune, a labor force of three thousand people from the entire commune was immediately organized to open rivers, dig canals, and build water conservancy projects. In the third year, the entire commune achieved automatic irrigation through a network of canals. This year, Henan Province experienced a rare drought lasting over nine months, but the Qi Licheng People's Commune was not affected by the drought. The average yield per unit area of wheat was over two hundred sixty jin, setting a historical record. Early autumn, late autumn, and cotton crops all grew better than in previous years.

Before the establishment of the commune, the entire commune had only three tractors, and the area plowed by machines was only twenty-five percent. After the establishment of the commune, relying on the commune's accumulation, over one hundred tractors, seeders, internal combustion engines, and various machinery were purchased successively. The area plowed by machines increased to over eighty percent. With the improvement of mechanization, semi-mechanized tools also developed significantly. Before the establishment of the commune, the entire commune had only seventy-five horse-drawn carts, but now it has developed to over four hundred seventy. Flatbed carts and hand-pushed rubber-wheeled carts have been widely developed and used. Fertilizers and pesticides are universally applied. In more than half of the production brigades, such as Liuzhuang and Songzhuang, mechanized farming is used, and within three days, it is possible to simultaneously complete one round each of weeding, pest control, and fertilizer application, fully demonstrating the advantages of the people's commune and the power of mechanization. Before the establishment of the commune, only Qi Licheng had electric lighting. Now, power lines crisscross the entire commune's villages and fields like a spider web, not only expanding the lighting range but also using electricity for irrigation, ginning, milling, and oil pressing in all forty-three production brigades.

The improvement of the four modernizations in agriculture has not only greatly enhanced the people's commune's disaster resistance but also raised the commune's labor productivity to a new level.

The people's commune is not only an organizer of production but also an organizer of life. The Qi Licheng People's Commune's distribution principle is to first ensure the basic needs of the majority of the commune members. On the basis of continuous production development, the commune increases the communist factor. For those who have basic rations but still cannot be self-sufficient, such as martyrs, military personnel, workers, cadres, disabled veterans, and families with many children and financial difficulties, different care and subsidies are provided. For those who have completely lost the ability to work, such as widows, orphans, the elderly, and the disabled, the commune implements the "five guarantees" to ensure they have support from birth to death. The commune also takes care of women's special needs from all aspects, helping them get rid of household chores so that they can all participate in production and social activities. In addition, the entire commune has a hospital, a film projection team, and forty-nine primary and secondary schools, achieving universal primary education. The living standards and purchasing power of the commune members have also significantly improved.

The Qi Licheng People's Commune is a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought study classes are widespread in the commune, production brigades, production teams, and commune members' households. The Mao Zedong Thought study classes organize the broad revolutionary masses to carry out extensive and in-depth revolutionary criticism, using the brilliant achievements of the Qi Licheng People's Commune over the past ten years to criticize the various reactionary fallacies about the people's commune spread by China's Khrushchev and his agents, making them stink to high heaven.

The brilliant achievements of the Qi Licheng People's Commune over the past ten years have proven the unparalleled power of the people's commune's "unity and public ownership."

The broad poor and lower-middle peasants praise, "The people's commune is great! 'Individual farming is like a single plank bridge, shaky with every step; the people's commune is a golden bridge, leading to the road of communism.' We are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and strive to make the Qi Licheng People's Commune, which our great leader Chairman Mao personally inspected, even better!

　　一大二公　百业俱兴
    中国赫鲁晓夫说人民公社“办早了”，“办糟了”，七里营公社以铁的事实回击了这种恶毒的谰言。公社成立十年来，有七个年头遭受自然灾害，有些灾害是空前的。但由于人民公社发挥了“一大二公”的优越性和政社合一的组织威力，战胜了各种自然灾害和阶级敌人的破坏，生产力大发展，粮棉单产比公社化前成倍增长。社办工业和大队的小型工厂如雨后春笋，农、林、牧、副、渔全面发展，公共积累已由公社化前的三十几万元增加到七百七十多万元，群众的生活水平也有很大提高。
    七里营的水利问题，从互助组、初级社到高级社都没有很好解决。公社成立后，立即组织全公社三千人的劳动大军，开河挖渠，兴修水利。第三年全社就实现了灌溉自流河网化。今年，河南遇到历史上少有的、持续九个多月的干旱，但七里营人民公社却没有受到旱情的威胁，小麦平均单产二百六十多斤，创造了历史上最高的产量。早秋晚秋和棉花，比往年长得都好。
    公社化前，全社只有三台拖拉机，机耕面积只有百分之二十五；公社化后，依靠人民公社的积累，又陆续购买了拖拉机、播种机、内燃动力机和各种机具百余部，机耕面积提高到百分之八十以上。随着机械化程度的提高，半机械化工具也有很大发展。公社化前，全社只有七十五辆马车，现在已经发展到四百七十多辆。平车和手推胶轮车大量发展，并普遍应用化肥、农药。刘庄、宋庄等一半以上的大队，运用机械化耕作，三天内就可以同时进行中耕、治虫、追肥各一遍，充分显示出人民公社的优越性和机械化的威力。公社化前，只有七里营有电灯照明，现在电线象蛛网般纵横全社的村庄和田野，不仅照明范围扩大，而且，全社四十三个大队，在排灌、轧花、磨面、榨油等方面都用上了电。
    农业四化程度的提高，不仅大大加强了人民公社的抗灾能力，并且把公社的劳动生产率，提到一个新的高度。
    人民公社不仅是生产的组织者，也是生活的组织者。七里营人民公社的分配原则，首先是保证广大社员生活上的基本需要。在生产不断发展的基础上，增加共产主义因素。对有了基本口粮仍然不能自给的烈、军、工、干属，残废军人，多子女困难户，予以不同的照顾和补贴。对于完全丧失劳动能力的鳏寡孤独残废者，实行“五保”，使他们生老病死都有依靠。我们还从各方面照顾妇女的特殊需要，帮助她们摆脱家务劳动，使她们都能参加生产，参加社会活动。另外，全公社有医院、有电影放映队，有四十九所中、小学校，普及了小学教育。社员的生活水平和购买能力也大大提高了。
    七里营人民公社是一座毛泽东思想大学校，毛泽东思想学习班遍及公社、大队、生产队及社员的家庭。毛泽东思想学习班组织广大革命群众广泛深入地开展了革命的大批判，用七里营人民公社十年来所取得的辉煌成就，把中国赫鲁晓夫和他的代理人所散布的关于人民公社的种种反动谬论，批判得臭不可闻。
    我们七里营人民公社十年来的辉煌成就，证明了人民公社“一大二公”的无比威力。
    广大贫下中农赞颂道：“人民公社就是好！”“单干好比独木桥，走一步来摇三摇；人民公社是金桥，通向共产主义路一条。”我们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，努力把我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自视察过的七里营人民公社办得好上加好！
