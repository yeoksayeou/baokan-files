The revolutionary committee of the Tianjin Four New Cotton Mill has fully leveraged the "Revolution and Production Service Squads" created by the workers during the Cultural Revolution, relying on workers to manage the enterprise. This has made the service squads the basic power organs of the factory. Over 700 workers have been elected as members of the service squads. They are both production laborers and enterprise managers, demonstrating the leading role of the working class in promoting revolution and production. Workers say, "In the past, the capitalist roaders controlled us, but now the revolutionary committee relies on us." The entire factory is in the midst of a fervent revolution, and production has surged significantly.

The "Revolution and Production Service Squads" are a new creation by the working class to fully exercise their leadership. Since the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, a handful of class enemies within the Four New Cotton Mill, unwilling to accept their demise, have been spreading the poisonous winds of anarchism and counter-revolutionary economism, inciting workers to fight each other, and plotting to sabotage production to achieve their evil goal of disrupting the Cultural Revolution. Facing this situation, the PLA support team and the leaders of the mass organizations went to the spinning workshop of the first spinning room in November of last year to conduct in-depth investigations. They worked and studied with the workers, helping them organize evening classes to study Mao Zedong Thought. Through study, the workers raised their class struggle and line struggle consciousness, took the initiative to shoulder the responsibility of promoting revolution and production, and elected representatives to establish the "Revolution and Production Service Squads." They resolutely opposed anarchism and smashed the counter-revolutionary economism plot, quickly improving attendance rates, and transforming the revolutionary and production landscape.

In February of this year, after the establishment of the revolutionary committee of the Four New Cotton Mill, the advanced experience of the first spinning room's spinning workshop was promoted throughout the factory. Various workshops and teams quickly established service squads. The elected squad members were assigned different responsibilities: some led the revolutionary criticism and struggle against the enemy, some focused on production, and others managed logistics. They were the organizers and backbone of the Mao Zedong Thought study classes, active propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought, and vanguards leading the broad masses in launching a fierce attack on a handful of class enemies. At the same time, the squad members were also pioneers in promoting production and experts in enterprise management. They enthusiastically helped the masses achieve ideological transformation and cared for the lives of the masses, becoming the confidants of the masses.

During the intense revolutionary criticism, revolutionary workers held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, launching a thorough criticism and denunciation of the "expert management," "technology first," and "material incentives" lines promoted by China's Khrushchev and his agents. They smashed the management system set up by them to control workers. Workers said that the "Revolution and Production Service Squads" are indeed good. They fully rely on workers to participate in management, and we workers are fully capable of managing the enterprise well.

During the organizational reform, the factory revolutionary committee always remembered Chairman Mao's teaching: "As long as we rely on the people, firmly believe that the creative power of the masses is boundless, and thus trust the people and unite with them, we can overcome any difficulty." They summarized the advantages of the service squads in participating in enterprise management in a short period and believed that the service squads, with class struggle as the key link, highlighted proletarian politics. Establishing service squads is a revolution in enterprise management. It fundamentally changed the relationship between management personnel and workers, making it easier to fully exert the leading role of the working class in revolution and production. Based on the actual situation of the factory and the opinions of the revolutionary workers, the factory revolutionary committee decided to abolish the two-level management institutions of workshops and shift supervisors, making the service squads the basic power organs of the factory. The factory revolutionary committee directly led the service squads. After the organizational reform, the number of management personnel in the factory, including technical personnel, was reduced from the original 282 to 40, accounting for less than 1% of the total number of employees in the factory. The rest of the personnel were all sent to the production front line to participate in production. Some demoted cadres were also elected by the masses as members of the service squads, continuing to play their backbone role.

Under the leadership of the factory revolutionary committee, after the establishment of the service squads in various workshops and teams, they paid special attention to carrying out ideological and political work. Under their influence, the entire factory saw a strong atmosphere of revolutionary workers doing ideological and political work and fighting class struggle.

Chairman Mao taught: "The most intelligent and talented are those with the most practical experience." The members of the service squads in various workshops and teams are mostly workers with practical experience. They are deeply rooted among the masses, and when they encounter problems, they study and discuss them with the workers, asking everyone for advice and ideas. Many problems were solved quickly and well by fully absorbing the opinions of the masses, which was praised by the masses. The service squads are most familiar with and understand production, and they arrange production very appropriately.

The service squads are a good form of absorbing the masses to participate in democratic management and promoting production. The broad masses of workers have truly become the masters of the enterprise, with everyone caring about the revolution and production, and everyone contributing ideas for enterprise management, strengthening the sense of collective ownership. The more than 4,000 workers in the factory think and work together, forming an iron fist. Now, the entire factory, from one workshop to another, and from one team to another, practices mutual convenience and mutual assistance, and the spirit of communism is highly praised. When a workshop encounters a situation where workers are absent and production is affected, other workshops, upon hearing the news, actively send personnel to support them. The maintenance and repair departments also actively send personnel to support the production of the operating workshops while ensuring normal production. The service squad of the spinning workshop of the second spinning room decided to break the long-standing low production in the high-temperature season, increase the speed of the machines, and turn low production into high production. They actively invited the service members of the maintenance, spinning, and air conditioning departments to hold a joint meeting, asking veteran workers to help them solve some difficulties that inevitably arise due to the increased speed of the machines. With the strong support of the service squads of the brother workshops, they increased the speed of the machines by 25 revolutions per minute, increasing production by about 10%, creating a new high production record in the high-temperature season. Under the leadership of the spinning workers, the entire factory saw a new situation of mutual pursuit and promotion, pushing production forward significantly. The factory's production level in June created a new high in the factory's history. In July, they continued to advance, increasing production by 3.2% compared to June. In August, production continued to rise steadily.

    依靠工人管理企业　革命生产面貌一新
    天津四新纱厂革委会充分发挥工人创造的“抓革命促生产勤务小组”的作用
    据新华社天津二十三日电　天津四新纱厂革命委员会充分发挥工人群众在文化大革命中创造的“抓革命促生产勤务小组”的作用，依靠工人管理企业，使勤务小组成为工厂的基层权力机构。全厂有七百多工人被选为勤务小组成员，他们既是生产劳动者，又是企业管理者，显示出工人阶级在抓革命促生产中的领导作用。工人们说：“过去走资派是管我们，现在革委会是靠我们。”全厂革命搞得热火朝天，生产大幅度上升。
      “抓革命促生产勤务小组”，是工人阶级充分发挥自己的领导作用所创造的新事物。无产阶级文化大革命开始以后，四新纱厂内一小撮阶级敌人不甘心自己的灭亡，大肆煽动无政府主义和反革命经济主义妖风，挑动群众斗群众，阴谋破坏生产，从而达到破坏文化大革命的罪恶目的。面对这种情况，驻厂解放军支左人员和群众组织负责人在去年十一月深入一纺场细纱车间的甲班蹲点，和工人同劳动同学习，帮助工人举办业余毛泽东思想学习班。经过学习，工人提高了阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，主动挑起抓革命促生产的重担，自己推选出代表建立起“抓革命促生产勤务小组”，大反无政府主义，粉碎了反革命经济主义的阴谋，迅速提高了出勤率，革命和生产面貌焕然一新。
    今年二月，四新纱厂革命委员会成立后，在全厂推广了一纺场细纱车间甲班的先进经验，于是各班组纷纷建立起勤务小组。被大家选出的勤务员，有的分工负责领导革命大批判和对敌斗争，有的负责抓生产，有的管后勤。他们是大办毛泽东思想学习班的组织者和骨干，又是毛泽东思想的积极的宣传员，是带领广大群众向一小撮阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻的先锋；同时，勤务员还是促生产的闯将和企业管理的能手。他们热情帮助群众实现思想革命化，并且关心群众的生活，成为群众的知心人。
    在轰轰烈烈的革命大批判中，革命职工们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大批狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人所推行的“专家治厂”、“技术第一”、“物质刺激”的一整套反革命修正主义建厂路线，大破他们专为“管”工人而设置的管理制度。工人们说，如今的“抓革命促生产勤务小组”就是好。它充分依靠工人参加管理，我们工人完全有能力把企业管理好。
    厂革委会在改革机构的过程中，牢记毛主席“只要我们依靠人民，坚决地相信人民群众的创造力是无穷无尽的，因而信任人民，和人民打成一片，那就任何困难也能克服”的教导，总结了勤务小组在短短的时间内参加企业管理表现出来的好处，认为勤务小组以阶级斗争为纲，突出了无产阶级政治。建立勤务小组是企业管理上的一个革命，它从根本上改变了管理人员和工人的关系，便于充分发挥工人阶级在革命和生产中的领导作用。厂革委会根据本厂的实际情况和广大革命职工的意见，决定取消车间、值班长两级管理机构，以勤务小组作为工厂的基层权力机构。厂革命委员会一竿子扎到底，对勤务小组实行面对面的领导。机构改革后，全厂的管理干部包括技术干部由原来的二百八十二人减为四十人，仅占全厂职工总数的百分之一弱，其余干部全部充实生产第一线，参加生产劳动。有些下放干部还被群众选为勤务小组的成员，继续发挥其骨干作用。
    在工厂革委会的领导下，各班组勤务小组成立以后，特别注意开展思想政治工作。在他们的带动下，全厂出现了革命职工人人做思想政治工作，人人抓阶级斗争的浓厚的政治空气。
    毛主席教导说：“最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”各班组的勤务小组成员大都是有实践经验的工人，他们深深扎根于群众之中，遇到问题就同工人一起研究，请大家出主意想办法。许多问题都是充分吸取了群众的意见，然后才做出决定的，所以问题解决得又快又好，受到群众的赞扬。勤务小组对生产最熟悉最了解，他们把生产安排得很得当。
    勤务小组是吸收群众参加民主管理、促进生产的一种好形式，广大工人群众由过去的从属地位真正成了企业的主人，人人关心革命，人人关心生产，大家为企业管理献计献策，增强了整体观念。四千多职工心往一处想，劲往一处使，形成一个铁拳头。现在全厂上下工序之间、各班之间互让方便，互助协作的共产主义精神大发扬。一个车间出现因工人缺勤而将影响生产的情况时，其他车间闻讯后主动抽出人力去支援。保全、机修等后勤部门的工人发挥生产积极性，在保证正常生产的情况下，也抽出人来支援运转车间的生产。二纺场细纱车间乙班的勤务小组决心打破历年高温季节低产的常规，提高车速，变低产为高产。他们主动邀请保全、前纺、空调等部门的勤务员开联席会，请老工人协助他们解决由于车速加快而必然出现的一些困难。在兄弟车间勤务小组的大力支持下，他们将车速每分钟增加了二十五转，使产量提高了百分之十左右，创造了高温季节的高产新纪录，在细纱工人的带动下，全厂出现了你追我赶，互相促进的新气象，把生产大大向前推进了一步。这个厂六月份的生产水平创造了本厂历史上的最高纪录，七月份乘胜前进，比六月份又提高了百分之三点二，八月份生产稳步上升。
