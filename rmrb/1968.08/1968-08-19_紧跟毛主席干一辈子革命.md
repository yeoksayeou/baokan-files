		To the Editors:
			"The sea voyage relies on the helmsman, revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought."
		Looking back at our factory's two-year struggle in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we deeply feel that: following Chairman Mao means victory, firmly carrying out the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin is victory. Whenever we follow closely, understand deeply, and execute firmly, the revolutionary work advances, proceeds smoothly, and is invincible. Otherwise, words lack principles, actions lack support, progress lacks direction, and every step hits a wall.
		In the early stages of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, when our factory's working class was high-spirited, holding up the banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against the reactionaries" and advancing victoriously along the "Sixteen Points" personally drafted by Chairman Mao, the capitalist roaders and remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries within the factory, in order to achieve their evil goals of sabotaging the revolution and preserving themselves, created divisions among the mass organizations, seriously obstructing the normal development of the Cultural Revolution. At this critical moment, our great leader Chairman Mao issued the directive: "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest." This directive pointed out the correct direction for us. The revolutionary workers of our entire factory conducted night-long study and discussion. Led by the old workers, the revolutionary workers of the entire factory, with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," achieved revolutionary great unity in less than a day, and exposed the black hands behind the scenes obstructing the revolutionary great unity. Soon after, we established the revolutionary committee that the workers had been longing for day and night. From this struggle, we deeply felt that the working class must also continuously raise its political consciousness in the struggle, be both a pioneer in criticizing revisionism and a model in fighting selfishness, and follow Chairman Mao in everything, in order to fully play a leading role in all work.
		After the establishment of the revolutionary committee, due to the lingering poison of revisionism in the construction of political power by the Chinese Khrushchev, the organization was bloated, and there were too many people for too few jobs, which was not conducive to leading the revolutionary workers of the entire factory to build and fight. When we old workers were day and night thinking about how to help build the revolutionary committee, our great leader Chairman Mao issued the directive: "The revolutionary committee should implement unified leadership, break down overlapping administrative organs, streamline and downsize, and organize a revolutionary leadership team that is connected with the masses." Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! You are truly in our hearts! Now we see clearly and have found the fundamental direction for building the revolutionary committee. With the help of the People's Liberation Army, our factory's revolutionary committee resolutely took the path of streamlining and downsizing, achieving the revolutionization of the leadership team. The entire factory has seen a new high tide of grasping revolution and promoting production, with monthly production increasing and now exceeding the highest level since the factory was established.
		Chairman Mao teaches us in his latest directive: "The working class should also continuously raise its political consciousness in the struggle." We must study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the struggle, arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, and continuously reform our various non-proletarian thoughts to promote the revolutionization of our thinking. Only in this way can the working class fully play a leading role.

### 紧跟毛主席干一辈子革命

    紧跟毛主席干一辈子革命编辑同志：
      “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”
    回顾我厂两年来无产阶级文化大革命的战斗历程，我们深深体会到：紧跟毛主席就是胜利，坚决贯彻执行以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的战斗号令就是胜利。什么时候跟得紧，领会得深，执行得坚决，革命工作就前进，就顺利，就无往而不胜。否则，就会说话没有纲，办事没人帮，前进没方向，步步都碰墙。
    在无产阶级文化大革命运动初期，正当我厂工人阶级高举“对反动派造反有理”的大旗，沿着毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”胜利前进的时候，厂内的走资派及国民党反动派残渣余孽，为了达到他们破坏革命、保存自己的罪恶目的，在群众组织之间制造分裂，严重地阻碍了文化大革命运动的正常发展。就在这时，伟大领袖毛主席发出了“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突”的指示，为我们指明了大方向。我厂广大革命职工，连夜进行了学习讨论。在老工人的带动下，全厂广大革命职工以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，不到一天工夫，就实现了革命大联合，并且揪出了在幕后操纵阻碍革命大联合的黑手。不久，就成立了我们工人日夜盼望的革命委员会。从这段斗争实践中使我们深深地体会到：工人阶级也必须在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟，既当批修的闯将，又当斗私的模范，一切紧跟毛主席，才能充分发挥在一切工作中的领导作用。
    厂革委会成立后，由于中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面的修正主义毒害还没有彻底肃清，机构庞大，人浮于事，不利于率领全厂革命职工去建设、去战斗。当我们老工人正日夜考虑怎样帮助革委会建设的时候，伟大领袖毛主席发出了指示：“革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”毛主席啊，毛主席！您真是和我们心连心啊！这下我们心明眼亮，找到了革命委员会建设的根本方向。我厂革委会在解放军的帮助下，坚决走精兵简政的道路，实现领导班子革命化，全厂出现了抓革命促生产的新高潮，上半年生产月月上升，现在已超过建厂以来的最高水平。
    毛主席在最新指示中教导我们：“工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”我们一定要在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想来武装自己的头脑，不断改造自己的各种非无产阶级思想，促进思想革命化。只有这样，我们工人阶级才能充分发挥领导作用。
