The "Exhibition of Photographs of the People's Republic of China" currently being held in Fukuoka City, Japan, has received a warm welcome from people from various circles in Kyushu. In recent days, a large number of visitors have come to view the exhibition. Japanese revolutionary people highly praise the great teacher of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, and the great Mao Zedong Thought, and enthusiastically cheer the brilliant victories achieved by the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution.

During the visit, Japanese revolutionary people expressed their deep feelings of boundless love and boundless admiration for Chairman Mao, the red sun in the hearts of the people of the world, and declared their determination to strive to learn Mao Zedong Thought and follow the revolutionary road pointed out by Chairman Mao. In front of the giant portrait of Chairman Mao hanging in the exhibition hall, large crowds of visitors were attracted there and stayed for a long time, unwilling to leave. A 13-year-old boy named Matsumoto wrote enthusiastically in the guest book after the visit: "I really want to see Chairman Mao in person!" A visitor named Yamashita shouted after the visit: "Long live Mao Zedong!" Many people wrote enthusiastically in the guest book: "I greatly respect Chairman Mao." "Chairman Mao is great!" "Mao Zedong Thought is great!" Many visitors bought the red revolutionary treasure book "Quotations from Chairman Mao." Some visitors also bought the brilliant works of Chairman Mao, the "Three Articles."

In the exhibition hall, many visitors highly praised the brilliant victories achieved by the great proletarian cultural revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, and the great international significance of the Chinese cultural revolution.

Beraki Masakazu, chairman of the Fukuoka Prefecture (orthodox) branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association, said that after visiting the exhibition, I further understood that the brilliant victories of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution were achieved under the correct leadership of the great Chairman Mao Zedong, and were achieved by the Chinese people who armed their minds with Mao Zedong Thought and fought hard. Beraki said that the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution gave me boundless courage and great encouragement, making me more firmly believe that China is a strong bastion of the world revolution. Beraki also emphasized: "This photo exhibition is a school of Mao Zedong Thought."

Youth activist Shikamaru said that the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution has great international significance. It points out to the revolutionary people of the whole world the broad and smooth road for the proletariat to seize power and successfully advance from socialism to communism.

Shikamaru strongly condemned the heinous crimes of the Soviet revisionist clique and the Eastern European countries' revisionist clique in restoring capitalism, and also condemned the treacherous actions of the Japanese Communist Party's Miyamoto revisionist clique in betraying the revolution and spreading the illusions of "parliamentarism."

Shikamaru said that the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution greatly encouraged the revolutionary people of the whole world, especially the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America who are bravely fighting for liberation, and dealt a heavy blow to imperialism, revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries.

Shikamaru emphasized that the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution has widely spread Mao Zedong Thought to the world. He said that once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the revolutionary people, it will become a powerful material force and an invincible spiritual atomic bomb.

Shikamaru said that the Japanese people must complete the task of the Japanese revolution, and must take contemporary Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought—as the guiding ideology, and must follow the revolutionary road pointed out by Chairman Mao. Shikamaru said that the leading class of the Japanese revolution is the working class, and we must arm the minds of the Japanese working class with the great truth revealed by Chairman Mao and proven by the history of world revolutionary struggles—"political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." Whether or not one acknowledges that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" is the dividing line between Marxism-Leninism and revisionism.

A brave university student named Satoshi, who has thrown himself into the anti-American patriotic struggle of the Japanese people, highly praised the great leader Chairman Mao's brilliant, creative, and comprehensive inheritance, defense, and development of Marxism-Leninism, raising it to a new stage. He said that Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards world victory. The great proletarian cultural revolution led by Chairman Mao in China has opened a new era in human history. Satoshi emphasized that it is of great importance to widely propagate Mao Zedong Thought to the Japanese people today.

A union worker named Minichiro from Kitakyushu City said that I think the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution has clearly pointed out the road for the Japanese working class to follow.

Minichiro said that Chairman Mao is very great, and Chairman Mao's pointing out that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" has very profound significance. I firmly believe that with a people's army, there is everything for the people, and if there is no people's army, the Japanese people will not be liberated.

A university student named Suematsu, who has participated many times in the struggle against the U.S. military base in Hantima and the obstruction of the Japanese reactionaries in transporting ammunition for the U.S. empire, said that Chairman Mao pointed out: "The history of mankind is a history of constantly developing from the realm of necessity to the realm of freedom." The Chinese proletarian cultural revolution is reforming all the superstructures that do not conform to the socialist economic base, strengthening and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, and pointing out the bright road for mankind to advance towards a communist society.

Suematsu said that the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution is encouraging the Japanese people and the people of the whole world. He said that the most urgent task for the Japanese people at present is to smash the Japan-U.S. "security" system. Chairman Mao teaches us:

"The Japanese nation is a great nation. It will never allow American imperialism to ride on its head for long." The Japanese people will surely rise up and drive American imperialism out of Japan.

The "Exhibition of Photographs of the People's Republic of China" also displayed in the exhibition hall the Chinese clay sculpture "The Rent Collection Courtyard" and the clay model of the revolutionary modern ballet "The White-Haired Girl." These Chinese clay sculptures also received a warm welcome from the audience.

A friend of the Japan-China friendship movement in Hiroshima City, Kusunaga Yoshio, praised the Chinese clay sculpture "The Rent Collection Courtyard" for its strong political thought and high artistry; it is the result of Chinese revolutionary artists implementing Chairman Mao's instructions on literature and art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and a great victory of Chairman Mao's literary line.

The exhibition also screened Chinese films, which were warmly welcomed by the audience.

Japanese revolutionary people have boundless love for the great teacher of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. In the struggle against imperialism and revisionism, they hold high portraits of Chairman Mao and banners that say "Down with the reactionary and traitorous Sato government" and march in demonstrations.

    日本人民踊跃参观中国图片展览盛赞伟大的毛泽东思想
    毛主席把马列主义提高到一个崭新的阶段
    中国文化大革命大大鼓舞全世界革命人民
    新华社二十七日讯　东京消息：正在日本福冈市举行的“中华人民共和国图片展览会”受到九州一带的日本各界人士的热烈欢迎。连日来，有大批观众前往参观，日本革命人民高度赞扬全世界革命人民的伟大导师毛主席和伟大的毛泽东思想，热情欢呼中国无产阶级文化大革命所取得的辉煌胜利。
    在参观时，日本革命人民表达了他们对全世界人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席无限热爱、无限敬仰的深厚感情，表示了要努力学习毛泽东思想，走毛主席所指引的革命道路的决心。在展览会会场悬挂的毛主席巨幅照片的前面，大批观众被吸引在那里，久久地不愿离开。一位名叫松本的十三岁的少年，参观后在留言簿上热情地写道：“我很想亲眼见到毛主席！”一位名叫山下的观众，参观后高呼：“毛泽东万岁！”不少人在留言簿上热情地写道：“我非常尊敬毛主席。”“毛主席伟大！”“毛泽东思想伟大！”不少观众购买红彤彤的革命宝书《毛主席语录》。还有些观众购买了毛主席的光辉著作
  “老三篇”。
    在会场上，不少观众高度赞扬毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命所取得的辉煌胜利和中国文化大革命的伟大国际意义。
    日中友好协会福冈县（正统）总部理事长柏木正一说，参观了展览会以后，使我进一步了解到，中国无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌胜利是在伟大的毛泽东主席的正确领导下取得的，是中国人民用毛泽东思想武装了头脑、经过艰苦奋斗取得的。柏木说，中国无产阶级文化大革命给了我无限勇气和巨大鼓舞，使我更加坚定地相信，中国是世界革命的坚强堡垒。柏木还强调指出：“这一次图片展览会是一所毛泽东思想的学校。”
    青年活动家鹿毛说，中国无产阶级文化大革命具有伟大的国际意义。它给全世界革命人民指出了无产阶级在夺取政权后，胜利地从社会主义走向共产主义的康庄大道。
    鹿毛强烈谴责苏修叛徒集团和东欧国家的修正主义集团复辟资本主义的滔天罪行，并且谴责日共宫本修正主义集团背叛革命，散布“议会主义”幻想的罪恶行径。
    鹿毛说，中国无产阶级文化大革命大大地鼓舞了全世界革命人民，特别是鼓舞了正在为争取解放而英勇地进行武装斗争的亚非拉各国人民，沉重地打击了帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派。
    鹿毛强调指出，中国无产阶级文化大革命向全世界广泛地传播了毛泽东思想。他说，毛泽东思想一旦被革命人民所掌握，就会变成强大的物质力量，变成威力无比的精神原子弹。
    鹿毛说，日本人民要完成日本革命的任务，就必须以当代的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想为指导思想，必须走毛主席指出的革命道路。鹿毛说，日本革命的领导阶级是工人阶级，我们必须用毛主席揭示的而被世界革命斗争的历史已经证实了的伟大真理——“枪杆子里面出政权”的思想去武装日本工人阶级的头脑。承认不承认“枪杆子里面出政权”，是区别马克思列宁主义和修正主义的分水岭。
    一位勇敢地投身到日本人民的反美爱国斗争的大学生为贞，高度赞扬伟大领袖毛主席天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段。他说，毛泽东思想是在帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义。毛主席领导中国人民进行的无产阶级文化大革命给人类历史开辟了新纪元。为贞强调说，今天广泛地向日本人民宣传毛泽东思想具有极为重要的意义。
    北九州市的一位名叫南一郎的工会工作者说，我认为，中国无产阶级文化大革命，给我们日本工人阶级明确地指出了应走的道路。
    南一郎说，毛主席非常伟大，毛主席指出“枪杆子里面出政权”，具有非常深刻的意义。我深信，有了人民的军队，才有人民的一切，如果没有一支人民的军队，日本人民就不能获得解放。
    曾经多次地参加过反对美军板付基地和阻止日本反动派为美帝运送弹药的一位大学生末吉说，毛主席指出：“人类的历史，就是一个不断地从必然王国向自由王国发展的历史。”中国无产阶级文化大革命正在改革一切不适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑，加强和巩固了无产阶级专政，给人类走向共产主义社会，指出了光明大道。
    末吉说，中国无产阶级文化大革命正在鼓舞着日本人民和全世界人民。他说，日本人民当前最迫切的任务是粉碎日美“安全”体制。毛主席教导我们说：
  “日本民族是一个伟大的民族。它是绝不会让美帝国主义长期骑在自己头上的。”日本人民一定会奋起把美帝国主义从日本赶出去。
      “中华人民共和国图片展览会”，在会场上还展出了中国泥塑《收租院》、革命现代芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》的泥塑模型等。这些中国泥塑也受到观众的热烈欢迎。
    广岛市的一位日中友好运动的活动家玖村芳男称赞中国泥塑《收租院》政治思想性强，艺术性高；它是中国革命艺术工作者贯彻执行毛主席关于文学艺术为工农兵服务的教导的结果，是毛主席文艺路线的伟大胜利。
    展览会还放映中国影片，受到了广大观众的热烈欢迎。
