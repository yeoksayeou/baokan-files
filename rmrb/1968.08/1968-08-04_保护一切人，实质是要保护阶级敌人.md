Our great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "Whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between proletarian dictatorship and bourgeois dictatorship." Chairman Mao's latest directive profoundly exposes the counter-revolutionary nature of China's Khrushchev and the other top capitalist-roader within the Party in their frenzied pursuit of the bourgeois reactionary line.

The other top capitalist-roader within the Party, during the War of Resistance, distorted the Party's united front policy, deliberately blurring the line between revolution and counter-revolution, loudly proclaiming the need to "unite all Chinese people and protect all Chinese people." This is all deceitful talk.

In a class society, the so-called "all" people are divided into two opposing classes, strata, and social groups, engaged in a life-and-death struggle. The state is a product of class struggle, a tool for one class to oppress another. Throughout history, both in China and abroad, there has never been a class that protects all people, nor a state that protects all people. The bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes always impose their dictatorship on the proletariat and the working people. Proletarian dictatorship, in contrast to the dictatorship of all exploiting classes, protects only the broad masses of the people and never protects reactionary classes and all reactionaries.

The other top capitalist-roader within the Party advocates "uniting all Chinese people and protecting all Chinese people," which means wiping out the crimes of the reactionary classes and all reactionaries, blurring the fundamental differences between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental differences between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental differences between proletarian dictatorship and bourgeois dictatorship. This is to protect all counter-revolutionaries, allowing them to infiltrate the revolutionary ranks to engage in sabotage and destructive activities from within, suppressing the proletariat and the working people. During the War of Resistance, those he protected were Japanese imperialism, traitors, and pro-Japanese elements. During the War of Liberation, those he protected were American imperialism and its running dogs, namely the comprador bourgeoisie, the landlord class, and the Kuomintang reactionaries representing these classes. Under socialist conditions, those he protects are a handful of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist-roaders, and unremolded landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists.

Isn't this the case? In our factory, which is "supporting the left," before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a handful of class enemies, under the protection of China's Khrushchev and the other top capitalist-roader within the Party and their agents, not only were not suppressed and punished but were even promoted, seizing the Party, government, financial, and cultural powers of the factory, imposing bourgeois dictatorship on the broad masses of workers, and engaging in capitalist restoration.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary masses of the Capital Cement Factory, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, seized power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, exposed these bad elements, and imposed proletarian dictatorship on them, purifying the ranks of the working class. The brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought shines upon the Capital Cement Factory. The revolutionary and production situation within the factory has taken on a very good new look.

A large amount of exposed evidence shows that the so-called "uniting all Chinese people and protecting all Chinese people" is, in essence, to protect all class enemies, with the fundamental aim of subverting proletarian dictatorship and achieving the evil goal of restoring capitalism. We must never forget class struggle and never forget proletarian dictatorship, and carry the struggle against the enemy to the end.

    我们伟大领袖毛主席最近指出：“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别。”毛主席的这一最新指示，深刻地揭露了中国赫鲁晓夫和党内另一个最大的走资派疯狂推行资产阶级反动路线的反革命本质。
    党内另一个最大的走资派，在抗战时期就歪曲党的统一战线政策，故意抹煞革命和反革命的界限，大叫大嚷要“团结一切中国人，保护一切中国人”。这完全是欺人之谈。
    在阶级社会里面，所谓“一切”人是一分为二的，是划分为两个敌对的阶级、阶层和社会集团，彼此进行着你死我活的斗争。国家则是阶级斗争的产物，是阶级压迫阶级的工具。古今中外，从来没有一个阶级是保护一切人的阶级，也没有一个国家是保护一切人的国家。资产阶级和一切剥削阶级，总是对无产阶级和劳动人民实行专政。无产阶级专政和一切剥削阶级的专政相反，它只保护广大人民群众，绝不保护反动的阶级和一切反动派。
    党内另一个最大的走资派，鼓吹“团结一切中国人，保护一切中国人”，就是一笔勾销反动阶级和一切反动派的罪恶，抹煞共产党和国民党的根本区别，抹煞无产阶级和资产阶级的根本区别，抹煞无产阶级专政和资产阶级专政的根本区别，保护一切反革命派，以便让他们混进革命队伍里来，从内部进行捣乱和破坏活动，镇压无产阶级和劳动人民。在抗日战争时期，他所保护的就是日本帝国主义、汉奸、亲日派。在解放战争时期，他所保护的就是美帝国主义和它的走狗，即官僚资产阶级、地主阶级以及代表这些阶级的国民党反动派。在社会主义条件下，他所保护的，就是一小撮叛徒、特务和死不改悔的走资派和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子。
    事实不正是这样吗？在我们“支左”的首都水泥厂，在文化大革命以前，一小撮阶级敌人，在中国赫鲁晓夫和党内另一个最大的走资派及其代理人的保护下，不仅没有受到镇压和制裁，反而受到提拔，篡夺了工厂的党、政、财、文大权，对广大工人群众实行资产阶级专政，大搞资本主义复辟。
    在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，首都水泥厂的广大革命群众，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，夺了党内一小撮走资派的权，揪出了这些坏人，对他们实行了无产阶级专政，纯洁了工人阶级队伍。毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉照耀着首都水泥厂。厂内的革命和生产形势，出现了一派大好的新气象。
    从大量揭发出来的事实证明，什么“团结一切中国人，保护一切中国人”，说穿了就是要保护一切阶级敌人，其根本目的是颠覆无产阶级专政，达到复辟资本主义的罪恶目的。我们一定要念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，把对敌斗争进行到底。
