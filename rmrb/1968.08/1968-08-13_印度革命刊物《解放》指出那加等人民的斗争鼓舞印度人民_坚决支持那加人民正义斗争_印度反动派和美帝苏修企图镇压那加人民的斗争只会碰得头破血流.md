New Delhi, August 13 (New China News Agency) — The July issue of the ninth volume of the Indian revolutionary magazine "Liberation" published an article expressing full and unwavering support for the Naga, Mizo, and Kuki peoples' just struggle against the oppression of the Indian reactionaries.

The article points out that the Indian people fully recognize that the Naga, Mizo, and Kuki brothers are fighting for a noble and just cause. The fundamental interests of the Indian workers and peasants have no contradictions, and will never have any contradictions, with their fundamental interests. On the contrary, they are fighting against a common enemy—the imperialists and the reactionary Congress Party. The just national struggle of the Naga and other peoples greatly inspires the Indian people to strengthen their struggle against their common enemy. No force in the world can break the unity between the revolutionary movement of the Indian people and the just struggles of the various nationalities. The Congress Party reactionaries and their masters—the American imperialists and Soviet revisionists—attempt to suppress the just and glorious struggle of the Naga people, but they will only suffer a crushing defeat.

The article, in discussing the incident in June when the Indian reactionary army launched a surprise attack on the Naga people's armed forces near the town of Chozuba, close to the Naga capital of Kohima, points out that the Indian troops openly violated the ceasefire agreement, which prohibited them from patrolling within a thousand yards of their positions, and launched an unprovoked attack on the Naga armed forces. However, all the cunning and premeditated provocations of the Indian reactionaries could not save their mercenaries from suffering a heavy blow from the Naga armed forces.

The article states that the true significance of the Indian reactionaries' armed adventure, which suffered a heavy defeat in Chozuba, lies in the fact that the entire Indian army, which has expanded by several hundred thousand since 1962, has been reorganized, rearmed, and retrained under the guidance and direct help of the American imperialists and Soviet modern revisionists. Almost the entire army has received so-called "counter-guerrilla warfare" training under the active assistance of the American imperialists. This army has also received weapons from the Soviet modern revisionists and American imperialists, including rockets and napalm. The defeat in Chozuba is not only a failure of the mercenaries sent by the Congress Party rulers but, more importantly, a heavy defeat for the American imperialists and Soviet modern revisionists. It clearly shows that, despite their various attempts, the Americans and Soviets can never intimidate even the tens of thousands of Naga people, let alone the hundreds of millions of Indian workers and peasants.

The article also states that the Indian reactionaries are frantically preparing to launch a new attack on the heroic Naga people. However, launching an armed attack on the Naga people, engaging in a "scorched earth" policy, will only arouse their indignation and hatred towards the Indian reactionaries. Such an armed attack will only plunge the Indian mercenaries into the fierce storm of guerrilla warfare by the Naga people, from which they will never be able to escape.

　　印度革命刊物《解放》指出那加等人民的斗争鼓舞印度人民
　　坚决支持那加人民正义斗争
　　印度反动派和美帝苏修企图镇压那加人民的斗争只会碰得头破血流
    新华社讯　新德里消息：印度革命刊物《解放》月刊七月出版的第九期发表文章，表示全心全意地、坚定地支持那加、米佐、库基等人民反抗印度反动派压迫的正义斗争。
    文章指出，印度人民充分认识到，那加、米佐和库基的兄弟们是在为一个高尚而正义的事业进行战斗。印度工人和农民的根本利益同他们的根本利益之间没有、也永远不会有任何矛盾。相反，他们正在反对共同的敌人——帝国主义和国大党反动派。那加等人民的正义的民族斗争大大地鼓舞着印度人民加强他们反对他们的共同敌人的战斗。世界上没有任何力量能够打破印度人民的革命运动同各民族的正义斗争的团结。国大党反动派和他们的主子——美帝国主义者和苏联修正主义者——企图镇压那加人民的正义和光荣的斗争，只会碰得头破血流。
    文章在谈到今年六月间印度反动军队在那加邦首府科希马附近乔楚马地方偷袭那加人民武装的事件时指出，印度部队公开违反了禁止他们到他们的阵地一千码之外的地方巡逻的停火协定，对那加武装部队发动无端的攻击。然而，印度反动派的一切狡猾的和蓄谋的挑衅，都不能挽救他们的雇佣兵遭到那加武装部队的沉重打击。
    文章说，印度反动派的这次武装冒险遭受惨重失败的真实意义在于：一九六二年以后扩大了几十万人的整个印度军队，是在美帝国主义者和苏联现代修正主义者的咨询和直接帮助下重新改编、重新武装和训练的。几乎全部军队都在美帝国主义者的积极帮助之下受过所谓“反游击战争”训练。这支军队还进一步从苏联现代修正主义者和美帝国主义者那里接受了武器，其中包括火箭和凝固汽油弹等杀人武器。在乔楚马遭到的失败不仅是国大党统治者所派出的这些笨拙的雇佣军的失败，而且特别是美帝国主义者和苏联现代修正主义者所遭受的一个沉重失败。它清楚地证明了，尽管美帝和苏修作了种种尝试，他们甚至连几十万那加人也永远吓不倒，更不用说吓倒亿万印度工人和农民了。
    文章还说，印度反动派正在进行狂热的准备，以便对英雄的那加人民发动新的进攻。但是，对那加人民发动武装进攻，搞“杀光、烧光、毁光”，只能激起他们对印度反动派的义愤和仇恨。这样一次武装进攻只能使印度雇佣军陷入那加人民激烈的游击斗争风暴中，使他们永远不能脱身。
