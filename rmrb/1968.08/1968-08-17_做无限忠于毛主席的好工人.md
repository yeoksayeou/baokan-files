At a time when the revolutionary masses of the entire nation are filled with revolutionary fervor and are striving to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our great leader Chairman Mao has once again issued a great battle call to us: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully give play to the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in all work. The working class must also raise its political consciousness in the course of struggle." Chairman Mao's extremely important directive is the greatest concern, the greatest trust, the greatest support, and the greatest encouragement for us, the working class. We are Chairman Mao's revolutionary workers. Chairman Mao is supporting us, and we must make Chairman Mao proud. We will resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's latest directives and forever be good workers who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao.

The working class has the greatest foresight, is the most selfless, is the most thorough in revolutionary spirit, and is the most loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao. Wherever Chairman Mao points, we will go. Last March, the revolutionary workers of our factory, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, achieved revolutionary great alliance by system and by team, and established a revolutionary committee with "three-in-one combination." Our factory was the first in Shenyang to establish a revolutionary committee. Therefore, a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party are terrified and hate it to the core. They carried out frantic sabotage and disruption, opposing the newly born revolutionary committee and attempting to stage a comeback. We, the working class, are the leading class and the main force of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. To defend Chairman Mao, to defend the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and to defend the newly born revolutionary committee, we workers, with the strong support and help of the PLA propaganda team stationed in the factory, braved the dark winds and turbulent waves, repelled the enemy's repeated attacks, and thus consolidated the revolutionary committee.

Chairman Mao calls on us to "grasp revolution and promote production." We will definitely shoulder the double burden of grasping revolution and promoting production, overcome difficulties in every possible way, and strive to fulfill the state's tasks. When there were not enough people to operate the shifts, one person took on the work of three. Many old workers ate in the factory and slept by the furnace. When there were not enough raw materials, the workers used scrap materials and finally overfulfilled last year's production tasks. The revolutionary workers of Workshop One carried forward the fearless revolutionary spirit of the working class, broke the bourgeois technical "authorities'" long-held view that a certain production process could not be changed, and created a world-advanced level.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The people's democratic dictatorship needs the leadership of the working class. Because only the working class has the greatest foresight, is the most selfless, and is the most thorough in revolutionary spirit. The entire history of revolution proves that without the leadership of the working class, the revolution will fail, and with the leadership of the working class, the revolution will be victorious." We, the working class, are determined, under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's latest directives, to be even more infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, to closely unite around the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, to unify our thinking, steps, and actions, to study and apply Chairman Mao's thoughts, to implement Chairman Mao's series of latest directives, to thoroughly criticize the reactionary bourgeois theory of "multiple centers means no center," and to strive for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    做无限忠于毛主席的好工人
    沈阳冶炼厂革委会
    正当全国亿万革命人民满怀革命豪情，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的重要时刻，我们的伟大导师毛主席又一次向我们发出了伟大的战斗号令：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”毛主席这一极其重要的指示，是对我们工人阶级的最大关怀、最大信任、最大支持、最大鼓舞。我们是毛主席的革命工人，毛主席为我们撑腰，我们一定要为毛主席争气，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示，永远做无限忠于毛主席的好工人。
    工人阶级最有远见，最大公无私，最富于彻底革命精神，最忠于伟大领袖毛主席。毛主席指向那里，我们就奔向那里。去年三月，我们厂广大革命工人紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，按系统、按班组实现了革命大联合，成立了“三结合”的革命委员会。我们厂是沈阳最早成立革委会的单位，因此，党内一小撮走资派怕得要死，恨得要命。他们进行疯狂的破坏和捣乱，反对新生的革命委员会，妄图进行复辟。我们工人阶级是领导阶级，是文化大革命的主力军，为了保卫毛主席，保卫以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，保卫新生的革命委员会，我们工人在驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的大力支持和帮助下，顶黑风，战恶浪，打退了阶级敌人一次又一次的进攻，从而巩固了革命委员会。
    毛主席号召我们“抓革命，促生产”，我们就一定挑起抓革命、促生产两副重担，千方百计克服困难，努力完成国家任务。人员不足，倒不开班，就一人顶三人，许多老工人吃在工厂，睡在炉旁。原料不足，工人们就利用废料，终于超额完成了去年的生产任务。一车间革命工人发扬了工人阶级大无畏的革命精神，大破洋教条，改革了资产阶级技术“权威”长期认为不能改变的一种生产流程，创造了世界先进水平。
    毛主席教导我们说：“人民民主专政需要工人阶级的领导。因为只有工人阶级最有远见，大公无私，最富于革命的彻底性。整个革命历史证明，没有工人阶级的领导，革命就要失败，有了工人阶级的领导，革命就胜利了。”我们工人阶级决心在毛主席最新指示的光辉照耀下，更加无限忠于毛主席，紧紧团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的周围，统一认识，统一步伐，统一行动，活学活用毛泽东思想，落实毛主席一系列最新指示，彻底批判反动的资产阶级的“多中心即无中心论”，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利而奋斗！
