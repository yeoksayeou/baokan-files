"The Voice of the Thai People" radio station issued a commentary on July 30, warmly celebrating the glorious victory of the people of Udon Province and the people's armed forces in bravely attacking the U.S. air base in Udon. The commentary said that this victory has caused the U.S. imperialists and the Thanom-Praphas group to panic, while the Thai people are jubilant.

The commentary said that in recent times, the people's armed forces and people in various parts of Thailand, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, have more frequently and fiercely attacked the enemy, with victories coming one after another. At the same time, the patriotic struggle of urban youth students against U.S. imperialism and the Thanom-Praphas group has also developed to a new stage, dealing a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism and the Thanom-Praphas group, and powerfully supporting and assisting the armed struggle of the rural people.

The commentary pointed out that this attack on the U.S. air base in Udon directly struck at the U.S. imperialist aggressors. It reflected the hatred of the people of Udon Province and the entire nation towards the U.S. aggressors, and reflected the Thai people's resolute opposition to U.S. aggression against Thailand and their firm determination to drive out the U.S. aggressors. This is a severe punishment for the U.S. aggressors who have been wreaking havoc in Thailand.

The commentary said that this attack shows that no matter how many modern defensive weapons the U.S. imperialists have, or how many troops they have to guard it, the Thai people's armed forces, who dare to fight and dare to win, can attack it everywhere.

The commentary pointed out that the U.S. air base in Udon is one of the important military bases used by U.S. imperialism to bomb and invade Vietnam and Laos. Therefore, the people's armed forces in Udon Province attacking this base is a major support for the Vietnamese people and the Lao people in their struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation.

The commentary pointed out that after suffering this heavy blow, the enemy is frantically intensifying the suppression of the people of Udon Province. The people of Udon Province must heighten their vigilance, unite more closely, and widely assist and support the people's armed forces. With a revolutionary spirit, they must resolutely counter the suppression by U.S. imperialism and the Thanom-Praphas group. The people's armed forces in Udon Province must, strategically, despise the enemy, treating it as a paper tiger, but tactically, must take the enemy seriously, treating it as a real tiger. They must arm themselves with Chairman Mao Zedong's strategic and tactical thoughts on people's war to fight more effectively.

The commentary said that the people's armed forces in Udon Province deeply understand that "revolutionary war is the war of the masses; only by mobilizing the masses can war be waged, and only by relying on the masses can war be waged." They also realize that to wage a protracted struggle against the temporarily superior enemy and gradually defeat the enemy to achieve final victory, the people's armed forces must mobilize the peasant brothers and arm the peasant masses. Therefore, they have extensively and deeply carried out propaganda, mobilization, and arming of the peasant masses in various villages. Because the people's armed forces are one with the masses and have the full support of the masses, the people's armed forces are like fish in water, able to roam freely, gradually expanding their areas of activity, and creating more conditions to attack the enemy.

The commentary firmly believes that the people's armed forces in Udon Province, who are one with the people and rely on the people, will become even more developed and powerful. Together with the people's armed forces and people in various parts of the country, they will launch a protracted and fierce offensive against U.S. imperialism and the Thanom-Praphas traitorous clique, and will surely achieve even greater victories.

　　“泰国人民之声”热烈欢呼人民武装袭击乌隆美国空军基地的辉煌胜利
　　乌隆战斗沉重地打击美国侵略者
　　号召运用毛主席关于人民战争的思想更有力地打击敌人
    新华社讯　“泰国人民之声”电台七月三十日发表评论，热烈欢呼乌隆府人民和人民武装英勇袭击乌隆美国空军基地的辉煌胜利。评论说，这一胜利使美帝国主义和他侬—巴博集团恐慌万状，而泰国人民却感到欢欣鼓舞。
    评论说，最近以来，泰国各地人民武装和人民在泰国共产党的正确领导下，更加频繁、猛烈地进攻敌人，捷报频传。与此同时，城市青年学生反对美帝国主义和他侬—巴博集团的爱国斗争也发展到了一个新的阶段，沉重地打击了美帝国主义和他侬—巴博集团，有力地配合和支援了农村人民的武装斗争。
    评论指出，这次对美国乌隆空军基地的袭击，直接打击了美帝国主义侵略者。它反映了乌隆府人民和全国人民对美国侵略者的仇恨，反映了泰国人民坚决反对美帝侵略泰国和坚定赶走美国侵略者的决心。这是对在泰国为非作歹的美国侵略者的严厉惩罚。
    评论说，这次袭击表明，不管美帝国主义有什么现代化的防卫武器，也不管它有多少兵力严密防守，具有敢于斗争、敢于胜利精神的泰国人民武装，到处都能够攻打它。
    评论指出，乌隆美国空军基地，是美帝国主义用来轰炸、侵略越南和老挝的重要军事基地之一。因此，乌隆府人民武装袭击这个基地，是对越南人民和老挝人民进行抗美救国斗争的重大支援。
    评论指出，敌人遭到这次沉重的打击后，正在疯狂地加紧镇压乌隆府人民。乌隆府人民必须提高警惕，更加紧密地团结起来，广泛协助和支持人民武装，以革命的豪迈精神，坚决回击美帝国主义和他侬—巴博集团的镇压。乌隆府人民武装和人民在战略上要藐视敌人，把它看成是纸老虎，而在战术上必须重视敌人，把它看成是真老虎。要以毛泽东主席关于人民战争的战略战术思想武装自己，更有效地进行战斗。
    评论说，乌隆府人民武装深深地体会到“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”他们还认识到，为了同暂时占优势的敌人进行持久的斗争，逐步地战胜敌人，争取最后胜利，人民武装就必须动员农民兄弟，武装农民群众。因此，他们广泛深入地在各个村庄展开宣传、动员和武装农民群众的工作。由于人民武装同群众打成一片，得到群众的全力支持，所以人民武装如鱼得水，能够自由驰骋，活动地区逐渐扩大，并能够更多地创造进攻敌人的条件。
    评论坚信，同人民群众打成一片的、依靠人民群众的乌隆府人民武装必将更加发展壮大。他们在同全国各地人民武装和人民一起向美帝国主义和他侬—巴博卖国集团发动持久、猛烈进攻的战斗中，必将取得更加伟大的胜利。（附图片）
