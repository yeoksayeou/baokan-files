Japanese progressive students are bravely launching a struggle against the decayed education system imposed by U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, demanding the democratization of universities. Japanese universities are a typical example of where the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries are implementing their decayed education system. The chairman of the board of directors, Koda Jujirou, has close ties with Japanese Prime Minister Sato Eisaku and is a lackey of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries. For a long time, Koda, relying on the youth division of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and colluding with right-wing groups, has imposed fascist rule on students. He prohibits students from holding meetings on campus, strictly controls student speech and publications, and even student wall posters and notices for activities on campus must be reviewed by the school's "Student Affairs Office." The reactionary school authorities, led by Koda, regard this university as a mere tool for profit, cramming ten thousand students into narrow, dilapidated classrooms in a few locations near Kanda in Tokyo, forcing three or four hundred students to squeeze into a single lecture hall to listen to teachers using loudspeakers. Koda and his ilk shamelessly call this irresponsible teaching method "mass production education." Koda and the reactionary school authorities also squander and embezzle tuition fees extorted from students. They recently admitted to embezzling twenty billion yen in one go.

Where there is oppression, there is resistance. For many years, Japanese University, which has been controlled by U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and has hardly seen any student movements, has recently erupted in a struggle against the decayed bourgeois education system. Students distributed leaflets, held demonstrations, and began occupying the main building and department buildings from June 15, raising red flags on campus and continuing the struggle. Although the school is now on summer vacation, progressive students remain on campus, guarding their battle positions. To counter the reactionaries' suppression, students have set up barriers on campus and organized patrols, patrolling day and night. The reactionary school authorities, in collusion with right-wing groups and armed police, have repeatedly raided the campus and arbitrarily arrested 286 students. However, the reactionaries' suppression has not made the students yield; instead, the students have launched an even more courageous struggle.

Through their unyielding struggle, progressive students at Japanese University have begun to achieve partial victories. On August 12, the school's humanities department head was forced to sign a guarantee in the face of the students' fierce struggle. The guarantee stipulates that no exams will be held and no tuition will be collected until the disputed issues are resolved, and it acknowledges errors in the suppression of students.

During the struggle, some leaders of the student movement at Japanese University have begun studying the works of Chairman Mao, such as "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and "On Practice" and "On Contradiction." Additionally, they have raised the slogan of "self-managed education," inviting some anti-American, patriotic progressive professors and well-known figures to give lectures and reports on China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the excellent international situation where the East Wind prevails over the West Wind. Students write their study notes in new notebooks to mark the beginning of a new stage in their studies.

    反对腐朽的教育制度　要求大学民主化
    日本进步大学生英勇展开斗争
    新华社二十一日讯东京消息：日本大学的进步学生展开英勇斗争，反对美日反动派强加给他们的腐朽的教育制度，要求大学民主化。日本大学是美日反动派推行腐朽教育制度的一个典型大学。校董事长古田重二良同日本首相佐藤荣作关系密切，是美日反动派的走狗。长期以来，古田依靠执政的自由民主党的青年部，勾结右翼团体对学生实行法西斯统治。他禁止学生在校内集会，对学生的言论出版严加控制，学生的壁报稿甚至学生在校内张贴举行活动的通知都要经过校方“学生科”的检查。以古田为首的校方反动当局，还把这所大学完全看成他们手中的营利工具，在东京神田附近等地几所狭窄、简陋的校舍内就招了十万名学生，使三、四百学生不得不同时挤在一个讲堂里听教员用扩音机讲课。古田之流竟然厚颜无耻地把这种不负责任的讲课方式美其名曰“大生产方式的教育”。古田和校方反动当局，还恣意挥霍、盗用从学生身上搜刮来的学费，据他们最近承认，一次就贪污了二十亿日元。
    那里有压迫，那里就有反抗。多年来被美日反动派控制得几乎没有开展过学生运动的日本大学，最近爆发了反对腐朽的资产阶级教育制度的斗争。学生们散发传单，举行示威，并从六月十五日开始占领校部和各系的大楼，在校园里升起红旗，坚持斗争。目前，虽然学校已经放暑假，进步学生仍留在校内，严守战斗岗位。为了反击反动派的镇压，学生们在校内堆起障碍物，并组织了纠察队，整天巡逻。反动的学校当局，勾结右翼团体和武装警察几次到校袭击，并无理逮捕了二百八十六名学生。但是，反动派的镇压并不能使学生屈服，相反，学生们展开了更加英勇的斗争。
    日本大学的进步学生经过不屈不挠的斗争，已经开始取得局部胜利。八月十二日，人文系的校方负责人在学生的猛烈斗争面前被迫在一项保证书上签字。保证书规定在争执问题解决之前不举行考试，不收学费，并且对镇压学生的罪行承认错误。
    在斗争中，日本大学的学生运动的一些领导人开始学习《毛主席语录》和毛主席的《实践论》、《矛盾论》等光辉著作。此外，他们提出了实行“自主教育”的口号，自行邀请一些反美爱国的进步教授、知名人士到学校讲课和作报告，讲解中国无产阶级文化大革命和东风压倒西风的大好国际形势。学生们把学习心得写在新的笔记本上，用来标志他们学习的崭新阶段的开端。
