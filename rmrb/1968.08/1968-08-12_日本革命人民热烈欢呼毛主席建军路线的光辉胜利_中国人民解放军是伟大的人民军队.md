Tokyo, August 11 (Xinhua) — Japanese revolutionary people recently spoke to Chinese journalists, highly praising the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, on his brilliant ideas about establishing a people's army and "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." They also enthusiastically praised the People's Liberation Army of China, which was personally founded and led by Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin Biao.

Japanese revolutionary journalist Yoshizaki said, "At the Gutian Conference, Chairman Mao taught us: 'The Chinese Red Army is a revolutionary political task force. Especially now, the Red Army is not just about fighting; apart from fighting to annihilate the enemy's military forces, it also has the important tasks of propagating to the masses, organizing the masses, arming the masses, helping the masses to establish revolutionary power, and even building the organization of the Communist Party.' This is Chairman Mao's brilliant military line. The People's Liberation Army of China is indeed a great people's army that has implemented Chairman Mao's military line."

Yoshizaki, when talking about the great international significance of Chairman Mao's teachings on "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun," pointed out that today, the revolutionary people of many countries in Asia and other regions are following Chairman Mao's great teachings, establishing people's armies, and fighting to overthrow reactionary rule and seize power. He said, "The Japanese people must also apply Mao Zedong Thought to the revolutionary practice in Japan."

Transport worker Kakinawa said, "Chairman Mao's military thought has great significance. Especially today, when modern revisionist trends are rampant internationally, and imperialism and modern revisionism are colluding to attack the revolutionary people of various countries, Chairman Mao's brilliant military thought is of even greater importance to the development of the international communist movement."

Kakinawa said, "Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's military thought, the People's Liberation Army of China is a revolutionary political task force, truly serving the people, with the noble goal of liberating the oppressed people. This army is so powerful because it is armed with Mao Zedong Thought."

Kakinawa said, "The People's Liberation Army of China, in resisting the aggression of American imperialism and defending socialist China, has once again proven the great truth pointed out by Chairman Mao: 'Weapons are an important factor in war, but not the decisive factor; the decisive factor is people, not things.' Kakinawa also said, 'Chairman Mao profoundly pointed out: 'The ultimate source of the great power of war lies in the masses.' The People's Liberation Army of China is an army that comes from the people and serves the people."

Revolutionary journalist Goto said, "Vice Chairman Lin Biao's inscription for the Postal Department's issuance of the special stamp 'People's Liberation Army of China': 'The People's Liberation Army of China is a force armed with Mao Zedong Thought, a force that serves the people wholeheartedly, and therefore an invincible force,' expresses Chairman Mao's military thought and military line."

Goto pointed out, "The reason why the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China achieved great victories is that this great revolution was personally initiated and led by the great leader Chairman Mao, guided by the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, with hundreds of millions of revolutionary people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and because there is a strong pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat in China—the People's Liberation Army of China, which holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought."

Goto enthusiastically praised the great achievements of the People's Liberation Army of China in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He said, "The People's Liberation Army of China not only strives to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in practice but also widely spread Vice Chairman Lin Biao's call to study Chairman Mao's works in practice, powerfully promoting the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought throughout China."

Goto emphasized, "It is precisely because the People's Liberation Army of China studies and applies Mao Zedong Thought the best that a large number of heroes with communist ideals, such as Lei Feng, Wang Jie, and Meng He, have emerged from this people's army."

Union worker Matsumoto said, "The brilliant victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has made us deeply understand the greatness and importance of Chairman Mao's military line. Matsumoto said, 'Chairman Mao's great military line has smashed the bourgeois military line that denies the prominence of proletarian politics and advocates a purely military viewpoint.'

Matsumoto praised the People's Liberation Army of China for, under Chairman Mao's guidance, supporting the broad masses of the left in seizing power from a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and sending representatives to participate in revolutionary three-in-one committees at all levels, strengthening and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat in China.

Power worker Hiro and transport worker Shibahara said, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'The central task and highest form of revolution is to seize political power through armed struggle, to solve problems through war. This Marxist-Leninist revolutionary principle is universally correct, whether in China or abroad, it is always correct.' Hiro and Shibahara said, 'We must, through practical struggle, establish the idea of using revolutionary violence against counter-revolutionary violence among the Japanese working class. To this end, we must thoroughly eliminate the poison spread by the revisionist group led by Miyamoto of the Japanese Communist Party and the right-wing social democrats within the working class, which advocates 'legalism.'"

　　日本革命人民热烈欢呼毛主席建军路线的光辉胜利
　　中国人民解放军是伟大的人民军队
    新华社十一日讯　东京消息：日本革命人民最近向中国记者发表谈话，高度赞扬世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席关于建立人民军队、关于“枪杆子里面出政权”的光辉思想，并且热情赞扬毛主席亲自缔造、亲自领导，林彪副主席直接指挥的中国人民解放军。
    日本革命新闻工作者芳崎说，毛主席在古田会议的决议中教导说：“中国的红军是一个执行革命的政治任务的武装集团。特别是现在，红军决不是单纯地打仗的，它除了打仗消灭敌人军事力量之外，还要负担宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众、帮助群众建立革命政权以至于建立共产党的组织等项重大的任务。”这是毛主席关于建立人民解放军的光辉路线。中国人民解放军正是贯彻了毛主席这一建军路线的一支伟大的人民军队。
    芳崎在谈到毛主席关于“枪杆子里面出政权”的教导的伟大国际意义时指出，今天，亚洲以及其他地区的许多国家的革命人民正在遵循毛主席的伟大教导，建立了人民的军队，为推翻反动统治、夺取政权而战斗。他说，日本人民也必须把毛泽东思想运用到日本的革命实践中去。
    交通工人柿并说，毛主席的建军思想具有伟大意义。特别是在今天，国际上现代修正主义思潮泛滥，帝国主义与现代修正主义加紧勾结，并向各国革命人民进攻的时候，毛主席的光辉的建军思想对国际共产主义运动的发展更具有重大意义。
    柿并说，在毛主席建军思想指导下建立起来的中国人民解放军是一个执行革命的政治任务的武装集团，它是真正为人民服务的，是把解放被压迫人民为崇高目的的。这一支军队之所以有强大的力量，是因为它是用毛泽东思想武装起来的。
    柿并说，中国人民解放军在反对美帝国主义侵略，保卫社会主义中国方面，所立下的功勋，再一次证实了毛主席指出的伟大真理：“武器是战争的重要的因素，但不是决定的因素，决定的因素是人不是物。”柿并还说，毛主席精辟地指出：“战争的伟力之最深厚的根源，存在于民众之中。”中国人民解放军是一支来自人民并为人民服务的军队。
    革命新闻工作者后藤说，林彪副主席为邮电部发行《中国人民解放军》特种邮票的题词：“中国人民解放军是毛泽东思想武装起来的队伍，是全心全意为人民服务的队伍，因而是战无不胜的队伍。”表达了毛主席的建军思想和建军路线。
    后藤指出，中国无产阶级文化大革命所以取得伟大胜利，最根本的原因是：这个大革命是由伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的，是以战无不胜的毛泽东思想指导的，有用毛泽东思想武装起来的亿万革命人民，同时，也因为有一支高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的、中国无产阶级专政的坚强柱石——中国人民解放军。
    后藤热情赞扬中国人民解放军在中国无产阶级文化大革命中建立的丰功伟绩。他说，中国人民解放军不仅自己努力活学活用毛泽东思想，而且还广泛传播了林彪副主席提出的活学活用毛主席著作的号召，有力地推动了全中国人民活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动。
    后藤强调指出，正因为中国人民解放军活学活用毛泽东思想最好，所以从这一支人民军队中涌现出大批象雷锋、王杰、门合这样的具有共产主义思想的英雄人物。
    工会工作者松本说，中国无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌胜利，使我们更加深刻地认识了毛主席的建军路线的伟大及其重要性。松本说，毛主席的伟大建军路线，粉碎了否定突出无产阶级政治、主张单纯军事观点的资产阶级军事路线。
    松本赞扬中国人民解放军根据毛主席的教导，在无产阶级文化大革命中，支持左派广大群众向党内一小撮走资派夺权，并派代表参加革命三结合的各级革命委员会，加强和巩固了中国无产阶级专政。
    电力工人广中和交通工人芝原说，毛主席教导我们：“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。这个马克思列宁主义的革命原则是普遍地对的，不论在中国在外国，一概都是对的。”广中和芝原说，我们必须通过斗争实践在日本工人阶级当中，树立用革命的暴力反对反革命的暴力的思想。为此，就必须彻底肃清日共宫本修正主义集团和右翼社会民主主义者在工人阶级内部散布的“合法主义”的流毒。
