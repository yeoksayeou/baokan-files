	Closely Follow Chairman Mao's Great Strategic Deployment
	and Thoroughly Bury the Reactionary "Multi-Center Theory"

	Over the past two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have deeply felt that the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin is the sole leadership center for the entire Party, the entire army, the entire nation, and all revolutionary masses. To better unite around this leadership center, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the hearts of the broad revolutionary masses, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize the reactionary "multi-center theory," and expose the slanderous and divisive tricks of a handful of class enemies.

	Last September, when the broad revolutionary masses in our factory were following Chairman Mao's great teachings to "unite the revolutionary masses, overcome differences, and do not split into two opposing factions" and were preparing to implement revolutionary great unity and seize power from a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, a handful of class enemies jumped out. They appeared in an ultra-leftist guise, spreading the reactionary theory of "me as the center," attempting to disrupt and sabotage Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. They spread the idea in one faction that "the issue of unity is the core issue, no matter who we unite with, we must 'put me at the center.'" In another faction, they instigated that "unity must maintain its independence, otherwise, it will be swallowed up by others." In response to the class enemies' despicable tactics of sowing discord, we and the leftist support personnel from the People's Liberation Army seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions on revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination. We recognized that the reactionary theory of "me as the center" spread by the class enemies aimed to sabotage Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, achieving their evil goal of overthrowing the dictatorship of the proletariat and restoring capitalism. Therefore, on the one hand, we exposed the class enemies who disrupted revolutionary great unity and implemented the dictatorship of the masses over them; on the other hand, we enthusiastically helped those influenced by reactionary ideas to engage in "criticizing selfishness and revisionism," overcome bourgeois individualism and factionalism, and thus unite all workers in the factory under the command of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao. We swiftly seized the power of the Party, government, finance, and culture usurped by a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and quickly established a revolutionary committee with the three-in-one combination.

	In this fierce struggle between the two classes and the two lines, we also clearly saw that some people, due to not paying attention to transforming their bourgeois worldview, became arrogant, and bourgeois individualism and factionalism flared up. They did not study or seriously implement Chairman Mao's instructions and the commands of the proletarian headquarters. They were blinded by the bourgeois "self," eager to compete for "positions" and "quotas," wage "internal wars," and engage in "me as the center," relaxing the struggle against the enemy and giving the class enemies opportunities to carry out their sabotage activities.

	Chairman Mao taught us: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not readily accept their defeat. They will make their last struggles." After the establishment of the revolutionary committee, a handful of unrepentant capitalist roaders, traitors, and spies directed their arrows at the revolutionary committee, plotting to sabotage production and inciting some people to resist the instructions and orders issued by the proletarian headquarters to "grasp revolution, promote production." To thoroughly smash the class enemies' ferocious counterattacks, we resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's great call, carefully and thoroughly did the ideological and political work among the masses, making them firmly guard their production posts. At the same time, we mobilized the broad revolutionary masses to deeply and persistently carry out the great criticism, launching continuous attacks on the class enemies, finally exposing the class enemies hidden within the revolutionary ranks, greatly raising the awareness of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines among the broad revolutionary masses, and swiftly launching a high tide of grasping revolution and promoting production.

	We deeply felt that to truly follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and be forever loyal to the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, we must actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, especially learn and use Chairman Mao's latest instructions, thoroughly eliminate bourgeois individualism and factionalism, strengthen the proletarian collective consciousness, and under the command of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, deeply and persistently carry out the great criticism, thoroughly criticize and expose the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of China's Khrushchev, carry out the struggle-criticism-transformation, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

　　紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署
    彻底埋葬反动的“多中心论”
　　北京印染厂革命委员会
    两年来无产阶级文化大革命的斗争实践，使我们深深体会到：以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，是全党、全军、全国和广大革命群众唯一的领导中心。为了更好地团结在这个领导中心周围，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，把毛主席的一系列最新指示落实到广大革命群众的心坎里，我们必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底批判反动的“多中心论”，戳穿一小撮阶级敌人造谣诬蔑、挑拨离间的阴谋诡计。
    去年九月，正当我厂广大无产阶级革命派遵循毛主席的“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织”的伟大教导，准备实行革命的大联合，向党内一小撮走资派夺权的时候，一小撮阶级敌人却跳了出来，它们以极“左”的面目出现，大肆散布“以我为中心”的反动理论，妄图干扰和破坏毛主席的伟大战略部署。他们在一派群众组织中散布说：“联合问题就是核心问题，不管跟谁联合，都得‘以我为中心’。”而在另一派群众组织中又挑拨说：“联合必须坚持自己的独立性，不然要被人家吃掉的。”针对阶级敌人这种挑拨离间的卑鄙手段，我们和解放军支左人员一起认真学习了毛主席关于革命大联合和革命三结合的最新指示，认识到阶级敌人极力散布的“以我为中心”的反动理论，其目的就是要破坏毛主席的伟大战略部署，以达到他们颠覆无产阶级专政，复辟资本主义的罪恶目的。因此，我们一面揪出破坏革命大联合的阶级敌人，对他们实行群众专政；另一面，我们又热情地帮助那些受反动思想影响的人搞好“斗私，批修”，克服资产阶级个人主义和山头主义，从而使全厂职工在以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的号令下团结起来，一举夺取了被党内一小撮走资派篡夺了的党、政、财、文大权，迅速地成立了三结合的革命委员会。
    在这两个阶级、两条路线的激烈斗争中，我们也清醒地看到：有些人由于不重视改造自己的资产阶级世界观，头脑膨胀，资产阶级个人主义、山头主义大发作。他们对毛主席的指示，对毛主席的无产阶级司令部的命令，不好好学习，不认真贯彻执行。他们被资产阶级的“私”字迷住了心窍，热中于争“席位”，争“名额”，打“内战”，大搞“以我为中心”，放松了对敌斗争，给阶级敌人进行破坏活动以可乘之机。
    毛主席教导我们说：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”在革命委员会成立以后，一小撮死不改悔的走资派、叛徒、特务，疯狂地把矛头指向革命委员会，阴谋破坏生产，并煽惑一些人对抗无产阶级司令部发布的“抓革命，促生产”的指示和通令。为了彻底粉碎阶级敌人的猖狂反扑，我们坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，深入细致地做好群众的思想政治工作，使他们坚守生产岗位，同时，又发动广大革命群众深入持久地开展革命的大批判，向阶级敌人发动持续不断的进攻，终于揪出了隐藏在革命队伍内的阶级敌人，大大提高了广大革命群众阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的觉悟，迅速地掀起了一个抓革命促生产的高潮。
    我们深深体会到，要真正做到紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，永远忠于以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，就必须活学活用毛泽东思想，特别是要学好用好毛主席的一系列最新指示，彻底肃清资产阶级个人主义、山头主义，加强无产阶级整体观念，在以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的号令下，深入持久地开展革命的大批判，把中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线批倒批臭，批深批透，搞好斗批改，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
