	Zimbabwean freedom fighters recently achieved a stirring victory in their struggle against the racist regime of Smith in Southern Rhodesia by applying the sixteen-character strategy for guerrilla warfare formulated by the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao.

	A recent issue of the Zimbabwe African National Union's publication, "Zimbabwe News," prominently featured Chairman Mao's sixteen-character strategy: "The enemy advances, we retreat; the enemy halts, we harass; the enemy tires, we attack; the enemy retreats, we pursue." The issue also published an article by a Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army guerrilla, vividly describing how his unit applied the principle of "the enemy halts, we harass" to attack an enemy camp and annihilate more than twenty Southern Rhodesian colonial troops.

	The guerrilla wrote: In front of our camp in the dense forest, a few miles away, our advance unit reported via radio that they had discovered a Southern Rhodesian colonial military camp: three tents, four trucks, one military vehicle, and one camouflaged armored car. Throughout the night and the following day, we continued to receive intelligence about this camp.

	He wrote: The guerrillas held a meeting and decided to attack this enemy camp before reaching our predetermined destination. In the evening, around eight o'clock, we set out toward this camp. By eleven o'clock, we had positioned our combat formation forty yards from the enemy tents. The enemy was unprepared; more than ten colonial soldiers were gathered around a campfire, drinking beer and smoking...

	Our comrades threw a grenade into the campfire, instantly filling the air with smoke. Then our machine guns and automatic rifles opened fire. The commander shouted, "Charge!" We rushed out with bayonets fixed to our guns...

	We seized the enemy's weapons and ammunition and set fire to the tents and two jeeps.

　　运用毛主席游击战争十六字诀打胜仗
　　津巴布韦自由战士出敌不意英勇杀敌
    据新华社达累斯萨拉姆一日电  津巴布韦自由战士最近在反对南罗得西亚史密斯白人种族主义统治的斗争中，运用世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席制订的游击战争的十六字诀，夺取了令人振奋的胜利。
    津巴布韦非洲民族联盟最近出版的一期《津巴布韦新闻》在显著地位刊登了毛主席制订的“敌进我退，敌驻我扰，敌疲我打，敌退我追”的十六字诀。这一期还发表了津巴布韦非洲民族解放军一位游击战士写的一篇文章，生动地描述他所在游击队在一次战斗中运用“敌驻我扰”原则，袭击敌人兵营，歼灭二十多名南罗得西亚殖民军的英勇斗争故事。他写道：在我们在密林中的宿营地前面几英里处，是我们的先头部队，他们用无线电通知说，他们发现一个南罗得西亚殖民军的军营：有三个帐篷，四辆卡车，一辆军用车，一辆伪装的装甲车。我们在整个夜晚和第二天陆续收到有关这个兵营的情报。
    他写道：游击队员们开会作出决定：在他们到达原定目的地前，袭击敌人这个军营。晚上，八点钟左右，我们向这个军营进发。十一点我们在离敌人帐篷四十码的地方部署好战斗队形。敌人没有防备，十多个殖民军的士兵在围着篝火喝啤酒、抽烟……我们的战友向篝火掷去一枚手榴弹，顿时硝烟弥漫。接着我们的机枪和自动步枪也打响了，指挥员一声喊：“杀！”我们就端着上好刺刀的枪冲杀出去……我们夺取了敌人的枪支和弹药，放火烧了帐篷和两辆吉普车。
