Revolution is the locomotive of history. The train of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, carrying all our ethnic peoples, is racing at lightning speed on the shining tracks of Mao Zedong Thought.

This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, from its inception to now, has only been a little over two years, yet it has brought about earth-shaking changes in every corner of our motherland!

In the Qilian Mongol Autonomous County of Qinghai Province, at an altitude of 3,400 meters, there is a township called Zhihoumao, where more than 820 households of herdsmen reside. Let us take a look at this small township of Zhihoumao to see the dramatic changes that have taken place on the vast grasslands!

The green grasslands stretch to meet the blue sky, and the white flocks of sheep roll like clouds. The herdsmen ride their galloping steeds, full of vigor, singing their favorite songs:

Our grasslands have seen the rising of a red sun,
This is not the sun,
It is the great leader Chairman Mao,
Chairman Mao's radiance is brighter than the sun!

This folk song expresses the boundless love of the broad masses of impoverished herdsmen for the great leader Chairman Mao.

Zhihoumao Township is experiencing stormy years.

The Chinese Khrushchev, through his agents in Qinghai Province, once stretched out his black hands towards the grasslands of Zhihoumao Township. As early as the initial period of liberation, they implemented a counter-revolutionary revisionist line that surrendered to feudal and capitalist forces: they did not struggle against or classify the landlords who had been riding on the heads of the broad masses of herdsmen; they allowed landlords to hire workers, rent out livestock, and engage in usury. Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out the happy road of people's communes to the broad masses of herdsmen, but the agents of the Chinese Khrushchev in Qinghai Province stipulated that landlords should enter the communes and that the impoverished herdsmen should pay them "fixed interest" year by year.

Taking advantage of our country's temporary economic difficulties, the agents of the Chinese Khrushchev in Qinghai Province stirred up a counter-revolutionary gale to dismantle the socialist collective economy on the grasslands of Zhihoumao Township. "Three Selfs and One Contract," "Two Fixed and One Reward," "Four Freedoms" — like a rolling dark cloud, they swirled over the heads of more than 800 households of herdsmen. When the people's commune was established in 1958, the township had more than 85,000 head of various livestock. After the onslaught of the capitalist gale, by 1962, not only had they not developed, but they had actually decreased.

Under the impact of this gale, some production teams disintegrated.

Polarization began to reappear on the grasslands.

But clouds cannot block the sun forever. In 1966, a sudden thunderclap echoed, and our great leader Chairman Mao personally ignited the flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The entire Zhihoumao Township boiled over, and the once silent vast grasslands were galloping with the "August 18th" warriors wearing red armbands.

The revolutionary flames stirred the hearts of every impoverished herdsman.

The revolutionary criticism and struggle, in the township, in the commune, and in the gathering places of the Mongol yurts, surged like a storm. Everywhere, there were voices of indignation and passion: The revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev is a black sign blocking the bright road to socialism, and it must be smashed to pieces!

Now, the township has held more than 160 large-scale criticism meetings, of which more than 80 were special criticism meetings targeting the revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev in pastoral areas.

At the revolutionary criticism meetings in the township, one often sees an 87-year-old old man riding a cow, eagerly rushing to join. Every time he participates in a criticism meeting, he speaks. The first time, he rode a yak for 40 li to attend the criticism meeting. Without waiting for the meeting's organizer to arrange, he stepped onto the stage holding a bright red copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and angrily recounted the bitterness of the Chinese Khrushchev dismantling the collective economy in the pastoral areas. He said, "The 'Two Fixed and One Reward' policy of the Chinese Khrushchev is leading us down a dark path, while Chairman Mao is leading us down the bright path!" After speaking at the meeting, he still felt uncomfortable, so he went to the community leader who had made mistakes and earnestly said to him, "We are angry with you because you sat on the same bench as the Chinese Khrushchev. But you were deceived, and as long as you follow Chairman Mao's teachings and correct your ways, it will be fine."

This 87-year-old old man is an impoverished herdsman named Angje.

In the old society, Angje was so poor that he had nothing. Every day, he could only survive by catching "haras" (a type of ground squirrel) and eating them. "Haras" are animals that easily spread diseases, so on the grasslands, seeing someone catching "haras" was like seeing a flood or a beast. Men would avoid them from afar, and women would quickly hide in the tents. However, Angje endured the unbearable hardships and lived to see the new society. Under the leadership of the Party, he lived a good life, had cows and sheep, and had a Mongol yurt. On the road to the people's communes guided by the great leader Chairman Mao, although he was so old, his heart was as happy as a child's. When the Chinese Khrushchev vigorously promoted the revisionist goods of "Three Selfs and One Contract" and "Two Fixed and One Reward," this old man was somewhat confused and silent. He rarely left his Mongol yurt.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a welcome spring breeze for the broad masses of impoverished herdsmen. At first, Angje did not understand what proletarian revolutionary line and bourgeois reactionary line meant, but he knew that this movement was personally initiated and led by the great leader Chairman Mao, and it was to ensure that the socialist mountains and rivers would not change color. He thought: Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! With just one word from you, we impoverished herdsmen would dare to climb mountains of knives. He felt that he had suddenly become much younger, and he could no longer sit still in the Mongol yurt. Wherever the revolutionary criticism and struggle was carried out, he would go to participate. If the cadre leadership of collective production slackened, he would ride a yak to various work teams to supervise. If the class enemy set fire to the grasslands, he would lead the people to extinguish the fire and then lead them to struggle against the enemy. Wherever he went, he would tell the people: "Chairman Mao calls on us to rise up in revolution, and we impoverished herdsmen must firmly follow the great leader Chairman Mao and revolution to the end!"

The impoverished herdsmen of Zhihoumao Township thoroughly criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line that the Chinese Khrushchev promoted in the pastoral areas, further promoting production. The various types of livestock in the township, in just over two years, increased from more than 110,000 head to nearly 160,000 head. Now, the various livestock products they deliver to the state, both in quantity and quality, have exceeded the highest levels in history.

The broad masses of impoverished herdsmen, through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, saw clearly the evil face of the Chinese Khrushchev's attempt to restore capitalism, and in the contrast between the two lines, they further recognized that Mao Zedong Thought is their lifeline.

The great Mao Zedong Thought has brought the broad masses of impoverished herdsmen of Zhihoumao Township to a new realm.

On the grasslands, we see the herdsmen holding red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao." Entering every Mongol yurt, we see red books placed in front of Chairman Mao's portrait on the highest spot. The male and female herdsmen we have come into contact with can recite "The Three Constantly Read Articles" and dozens or even hundreds of quotations from Chairman Mao.

Dala is a 67-year-old old herdsman. Because of his age, the production team takes care of him and his wife as "five guarantees" beneficiaries. In the past, Dala did not think there was anything wrong with this. He thought that he had worked hard all his life, and now that he was in a socialist society, it was only natural for the production team to support him. However, after studying "The Three Constantly Read Articles," his thoughts underwent a fierce struggle. The bright images of Zhang Zide, White, and the Old Man of the Yellow River surged in his mind. He thought of Chairman Mao, who is also so old, but works day and night for all the poor people in China and the world, and his heart was filled with shame. He couldn't help but think of his past. Dala had worked for the landlords since he was a child. As he put it, at that time, he had no right to sleep at night and no right to eat during the day. Because he couldn't eat, he had to gnaw on bones that the landlord's dogs had chewed on. Later, when he lost a calf while herding for the landlord, the landlord took away all his cows and tents and drove him away. He suffered for decades in the old society, only to end up with empty hands. Looking at today, he lives in a warm tent, wears new leather clothes, eats milk, meat, and butter, and outside the tent are herds of cows and sheep. If it weren't for Chairman Mao, where would he be? He felt that it was shameful to be content with being a "five guarantees" beneficiary, forgetting Chairman Mao's teachings on serving the people. Forgetting Chairman Mao's teachings is forgetting one's roots! A red heart dedicated to revolution drove Dala to find the production team leader and request a job assignment. The team leader initially wanted to persuade him to rest comfortably in the Mongol yurt, but Dala was so insistent that the team leader had no choice but to hand over the team's herd of cows to him to herd.

Dala now herds 120 cows alone, going out early and returning late every day. He proudly tells people: It is Chairman Mao who has made me a useful person to the people again.

Guan Xuecai is a herdsman. After studying "The Three Constantly Read Articles," he firmly remembered that he should be a person who seeks no personal gain and dedicates himself to others. One day, three sheep from another place ran into his herd, and for a long time, the owner could not be found. Guan Xuecai took in the three sheep, on the one hand, looking everywhere for the owner, and on the other hand, taking care of them as if they were his own team's sheep. When it was time to shear, he bundled the wool from these three sheep separately. Later, he finally found out that two belonged to Sailong Township and one to Zeku County, so he led the sheep and carried the wool, traveling a long distance to return them to their owners.

The brilliant Mao Zedong Thought is nurturing countless communists. The entire grassland is a new and moving scene. Every time they move their yurts, they have someone in front carrying the portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao. In the past, sometimes disputes over grasslands would lead to fights, but now, if herdsmen encounter disputes over grasslands, both sides first place the red book of Chairman Mao on their heads and then sit down together to study and criticize themselves and others.

The impoverished herdsmen of Zhihoumao Township, to ensure that their grasslands would never change color on the socialist track, selected their best sons and daughters to enter the newly established revolutionary committee.

Wande, 29 years old, was previously the leader of a revolutionary mass organization and is now the deputy head of the township revolutionary committee.

When Wande first entered the township revolutionary committee, he had no work experience and did not know how to serve the people. However, he repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's works and gained wisdom from the treasure house of Mao Zedong Thought: The masses are the true heroes, and to do work well, one must sincerely go to the impoverished herdsmen to be a student.

After the revolutionary committee was established, it quickly organized a Mao Zedong Thought study class that included cadres and leaders of mass organizations. In the study class, a few cadres and leaders of mass organizations, because they were not selected into the three-in-one leading group, were not in a good mood and could not seriously criticize and repent. Wande was responsible for leading the study class. What should he do? He thought that these comrades put their personal reputation and status first because they forgot their class bitterness. He remembered that not far from the township revolutionary committee lived a blind old impoverished herdsman named Chenglie. Chenglie had been a long-term worker in the old society and suffered immense pain and oppression. In the early days of the people's communes, he had been a team leader. Later, because he was blind, he could no longer be a cadre, but he did not slack off in his revolutionary will. As long as it was beneficial to the collective, he would eagerly do it. He could not see to study Chairman Mao's works, so he had others read them to him. Wande then took the study class to this old impoverished herdsman's yurt, first introduced the situation in the study class to Chenglie, and asked for his opinions. Chenglie listened and said earnestly, "You have good horses to ride, good guns to carry, and good yurts to live in, but you must not forget your roots!" Then, he recalled his sufferings in the old society, lifted his fur coat to show everyone the scars from when the landlord beat him while herding horses, and educated everyone not to forget the bitterness of the old society and to remember the sweetness of the new society. He also said, "We become cadres for the revolution, not to be 'officials.' To be an 'official' is to be disloyal to Chairman Mao!" Chenglie's words deeply educated everyone. The leader of the mass organization who had been upset because he was not selected into the three-in-one group, Strong Boat, seeing Chenglie's scars, thought of his own hardships in childhood, and couldn't help but say with tears, "I used to have the thought of being an 'official' and did not have the thought of revolution to the end; now I want to reverse it and be a lifelong old yellow cow for the people." The cadres who had been upset because they were not selected into the three-in-one group also felt very ashamed and immediately expressed their determination to overcome their bourgeois thoughts, not to seek fame or gain, and to wholeheartedly follow Chairman Mao in the revolution.

The Amuhe Commune organized a Mao Zedong Thought study class to liberate cadres. Some commune members, although they knew in principle that these cadres should not be overthrown, because these cadres had some minor disputes with them, they were unwilling to wholeheartedly liberate them from the perspective of "self." The leader of the study class, Wande, thought of a few old impoverished herdsmen in the area, Angje, Xueluo, and Huakuan, who saw problems comprehensively and had prestige among the people, so he went to these old impoverished herdsmen's yurts to seek advice. The old people pointed out sharply, "Some opinions of the masses should be looked at to see what kind of opinions they are. If they come from the perspective of 'self,' the more they are mentioned, the farther they are from socialism; if they come from the perspective of 'public,' the more they are mentioned, the closer they are to socialism." The old people suggested that the study class first study Chairman Mao's latest instructions on each person doing more self-criticism, actively carry out self-criticism and criticism of revisionism. Wande listened and immediately implemented it, quickly raising everyone's awareness, eliminating personal prejudices, and liberating the cadres of this commune.

The broad masses of impoverished herdsmen of Zhihoumao Township saw a new generation growing up from Wande. They said, "With the great leader Chairman Mao leading the way from above and the good cadres trained by Chairman Mao leading the way from below, we will definitely march towards communism."

    千里草原奔腾急
    革命是历史的火车头。
    无产阶级文化大革命的列车，正载着我们各族人民在光辉的毛泽东思想的轨道上风驰电掣般地迅跑。
    这场无产阶级文化大革命从开始到现在仅仅两年多的时间，而它在祖国各个角落里，却引起了翻天覆地的变化！
    在青海省拔海三千四百米的河南蒙古族自治县的草原上，有一个居住着八百二十多户牧民的智后茂乡。让我们通过这个小小的智后茂乡，看看发生在三千里草原上的天翻地覆的变化吧！一
    碧绿的草原连接着蓝天，雪白的羊群象朵朵滚动着的浮云。牧民们骑在驰骋的骏马上，意气风发地唱着最心爱的歌：
    我们草原上升起了红太阳，
    这不是太阳，
    是伟大领袖毛主席，
    毛主席的光辉比太阳还亮！
    这首民歌唱出了广大贫苦牧民对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的心情。
    智后茂乡正经历着风雷激荡的岁月。
    中国赫鲁晓夫通过他在青海省的代理人，曾经向智后茂乡的草原伸出了黑手。还在解放初期，他们就在这里推行了一套向封建势力、资本主义势力投降的反革命修正主义路线：对原来骑在广大牧民头上的牧主不斗、不划分阶级；允许牧主雇工、出租牲畜和放高利贷。我们伟大领袖毛主席给广大牧民指出了人民公社化的幸福道路，而中国赫鲁晓夫在青海省的代理人，却规定让牧主入社，还要由贫苦牧民逐年付给他们“定息”。
    中国赫鲁晓夫在青海省的代理人趁着我国处在暂时经济困难时期，在智后茂乡的草原上刮起了一股拆散社会主义集体经济的反革命妖风。什么“三自一包”、“两定一奖”、“四大自由”，象一阵滚滚的乌云，在八百多户牧民的头上旋转。一九五八年成立人民公社时，全乡各类牲畜有八万五千多头，经过资本主义妖风的袭击，到一九六二年，不仅没有发展，反而有所减少。
    在这股妖风袭击下，有的生产队解体了。
    两极分化开始在草原上重演。
    但是，乌云毕竟不能遮住阳光。一九六六年，突然一声春雷，我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自点燃了无产阶级文化大革命的烈火。
    整个智后茂乡沸腾起来了，沉寂的大草原上驰骋着带红袖章的“八·一八”战士。二
    革命的烈火激荡着每个贫苦牧民的心。
    革命的大批判，在乡上，在公社，在一簇簇的蒙古包群中心的场地上，风起云涌地开展着。到处是愤怒激昂的声音：中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义路线是挡在社会主义光明大路上的黑牌子，一定要把它砸个稀巴烂！
    现在全乡已召开过一百六十次大型批判会，其中有八十多次，是对中国赫鲁晓夫在牧区工作上的修正主义路线的专题批判。
    在乡的革命大批判会场上，人们时常可以看到有一位八十七岁的老人骑在牛背上兴冲冲地赶来。他每次参加批判会，都要发言。第一次他骑牦牛跑了四十里路来开批判会，不等主持会的人安排，就举着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》走上讲台，怒气冲冲地诉起中国赫鲁晓夫拆散牧区集体经济的苦来。他说：“中国赫鲁晓夫推行‘两定一奖’，是拉着我们走黑路，毛主席领导我们走的是光明的路！”他在会上发过了言，心里还觉得不舒服，于是又跑到犯错误的公社社长跟前，语重心长地对他说：“我们对你就是有气，因为你和中国赫鲁晓夫坐在了一条凳子上。不过，你是上了当，以后只要按照毛主席的教导改了就行。”
    这位八十七岁的老人是贫苦牧民昂杰。
    昂杰在旧社会穷得一无所有，每天只是靠着抓“哈拉”（即旱獭）、吃“哈拉”维持生活。“哈拉”是一种最容易传播疫病的动物，因此草原上一见到抓“哈拉”的，就象见了洪水猛兽，男人们远远地避开，女人早就钻进了帐篷。然而，昂杰终于忍受着难以忍受的苦难活到了新社会。他在党的领导下过上了好日子，有了牛羊，有了蒙古包。在伟大领袖毛主席指引的人民公社化道路上，他虽然那么大年纪，心情快活得象个孩子。当中国赫鲁晓夫大肆推行“三自一包”和“两定一奖”等修正主义黑货时，这位老人有些迷惑不解了。他变得那么沉默寡言，很少再走出自己的蒙古包。
    无产阶级文化大革命对于广大贫苦牧民是一场可喜的春风。开始，昂杰并不懂得什么叫无产阶级革命路线和资产阶级反动路线，然而他知道：这个运动是伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的，是为了使社会主义江山不变颜色。他想：毛主席啊，毛主席！有您老人家一句话，我们贫苦牧民就是刀山也敢上。他觉得自己立刻年轻了许多岁，在蒙古包里再也坐不住了。哪里开展革命大批判，他就到哪里去参加。队上干部对集体生产领导放松了，他就骑上牦牛到各个作业组去督促。阶级敌人在草原上放火烧草场，他跑在前头带领人们去灭火，然后又带领着大家去斗争那个敌人。他走到哪里，就对哪里的人们说：“毛主席号召我们起来革命，我们贫苦牧民一定要紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，坚决革命到底！”
    智后茂乡的贫苦牧民，把中国赫鲁晓夫在牧区工作中推行的反革命修正主义路线批得体无完肤，进一步促进了生产，全乡的各类牲畜，仅仅两年多的时间，就由十一万多头发展到了近十六万头，现在它向国家交售的各种畜产品，无论数量和质量都超过了历史上的最高水平。三
    广大贫苦牧民在无产阶级文化大革命中看清了中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的罪恶面目，同时在两条路线的对比中也进一步认识了毛泽东思想是自己的命根子。
    伟大的毛泽东思想，把智后茂乡的广大贫苦牧民带到了一个崭新的境界。
    我们在草原上，看到放牧员手里捧的是红彤彤的《毛主席语录》。走进每一个蒙古包，看到正上方毛主席像前放的是一本一本的红宝书。我们接触过的男女牧民，很多都能背诵“老三篇”和几十条甚至上百条毛主席语录。
    达洛是一个六十七岁的老牧民，因为他年纪大了，生产队就把他和他的老伴作为“五保户”照顾。过去，达洛并不认为这有什么问题，他想，自己勤勤恳恳劳动了一生，现在到了社会主义，由生产队来抚养，也是理所当然的。但是他自从学习了“老三篇”，思想上就展开了激烈的斗争。张思德、白求恩和老愚公三个光辉的形象在他脑子里翻腾着，他再想想毛主席他老人家也已经是那么大年纪了，却不分昼夜地为着全中国、全世界的穷苦人们操劳，心里真是说不出的惭愧。他不由得想起了自己的过去。达洛从小就给牧主干活。按照他自己的说法，那时候是夜里没有权利睡，白天没有权利吃。因为吃不上饭，不得不去啃牧主的狗啃过的骨头。后来，他给牧主放牛时丢了一只小牛，牧主把他自己的牛和帐篷全部拿走，把他也赶了出来。他在旧社会受了几十年苦难，到头来只落了两手空空。再看看今天，他住的是暖和的帐篷，穿的是崭新的皮衣，吃的是奶、肉和酥油，帐篷外面是成群的牛羊。如果没有毛主席，哪里还有自己？他觉得甘心当“五保户”，就是忘记了毛主席为人民服务的教导。忘记了毛主席的教导就是忘了本！一颗为革命献身的红心，驱使着达洛去找生产队长要求分配工作。队长最初还想说服他安心地在蒙古包里休息，可是达洛却是那样的坚决，以致队长最后不得不把队上的牛群交给他来放牧。
    达洛现在一个人放着一百二十头牛，天天早出晚归。他自豪地对人们说：是毛主席他老人家又把我变成了一个有益于人民的人。
    官却才旦是一个放牧员，自从学习了“老三篇”，他牢牢地记住了要做一个毫不利己专门利人的人。一天，有三只羊从别处跑到他放牧的羊群里，很久都找不到失主。官却才旦把这三只羊收养下来，一方面到处打听失主，一方面象对待自己队上的羊一样精心放牧。到剪毛的时候，他把从这三只羊身上剪下的毛分别捆好。后来，他终于打听出有两只是赛尔龙乡的，一只是泽库县的，他便牵着羊，提了羊毛，跑了很远的路程送还给失主。
    光辉灿烂的毛泽东思想培育着无数的共产主义新人。整个草原上是一片激动人心的崭新的景象。每次搬圈搬家都是由专人走在前面捧着伟大领袖毛主席的画像。过去，有时因为草场纠纷而发生武斗，现在牧民们如果遇到草场争执，双方首先把毛主席的红宝书顶在头上，然后一起坐下来共同学习，互相斗私批修。四
    智后茂乡的贫苦牧民们，为了使自己的草原在社会主义轨道上永不变色，他们把自己最优秀的儿女选进了新生的革命委员会。
    二十九岁的完德，以前是一个革命群众组织的头头，现在是乡革命委员会副主任。
    完德开始走进乡革命委员会的时候，工作没有经验，究竟怎样去为人民服务？心里没有门路。但是他反复学习毛主席著作，从毛泽东思想的宝库里，他得到了智慧：群众是真正的英雄，要会做工作必须诚心诚意到贫苦牧民中去当小学生。
    革命委员会成立以后，很快举办了包括干部和群众组织头头参加的毛泽东思想学习班。在学习班里有个别干部和群众组织的头头因为自己没有被选进三结合的领导班子，心情不舒畅，不能认真地斗私批修。完德负责主持学习班的工作，他怎么办呢？他想这些同志所以把个人名誉地位放在了第一位，都是因为忘记了阶级苦。他想起离乡革委会不远的地方住着一个双目失明的老贫苦牧民成列。成列在旧社会当过十七年长工，受尽了痛苦和压迫。公社化初期，他曾当过生产队长，后来因为双目失明不能当干部了，但并没有因为不当干部而松懈了自己的革命意志，只要对集体有利的事情他就争着去干，学习毛主席著作他看不见，就叫别人念给他听。完德就带着学习班的人来到这个老贫苦牧民的蒙古包里，先向成列介绍了学习班里的思想情况，请他发表意见。成列听了语重心长地说：“你们好马骑上了，好枪背上了，好蒙古包住上了，可千万不能忘本啊！”接着，他忆起了自己在旧社会的苦，他撩起皮袄，让大家看他给牧主放马时被牧主打的伤疤，教育大家不要忘记旧社会的苦，牢记新社会的甜。他还说：“我们当干部是为革命，可不是为当‘官’。要当‘官’，这就是对毛主席不忠啊！”成列的一席话使大家受到深刻的教育，那个因为没有结合而有过情绪的群众组织头头强舟，看到成列的伤疤，联想到自己小时候的困苦生活，禁不住含着泪说：“我过去有当‘官’的思想，没有革命到底的思想；现在我要把它颠倒过来，当一辈子人民的老黄牛。”原来因没被结合而有情绪的干部也感到非常惭愧，他们当场表示要坚决克服自己的资产阶级思想，不为名，不为利，一心跟着毛主席干革命。
    阿木荷公社办起了解放干部的毛泽东思想学习班。有的社员虽然从道理上知道这些干部不应该打倒，但是因为这些干部同自己发生过一些小纠葛，所以从
  “私”字出发，不愿意痛痛快快地把他们解放出来。主持学习班的完德，想到当地有几位老贫苦牧民昂杰、却洛和花欠看问题全面，在群众中又有威信，于是他就到这些老贫苦牧民的蒙古包里去请教。老人们一针见血地指出：“有些群众的意见要看是什么样的意见。如果从‘私’字出发，越提离社会主义就越远；如果从‘公’字出发，越提离社会主义就越近。”老人们建议学习班首先学习毛主席关于各自多做自我批评的最新指示，积极开展斗私批修。完德听了回来就照办，很快地提高了大家的认识，消除了私人成见，解放了这个公社的干部。
    智后茂乡的广大贫苦牧民从完德身上看到了新的一代在成长。他们说：“上有伟大领袖毛主席为我们引路，下有毛主席教导出来的好干部为我们带头，我们就一定能奔向共产主义。”
