	The handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, with China's Khrushchev at their head, are desperately opposing our workers, peasants, and soldiers in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They say, "To find answers to every problem in Chairman Mao's works is dogmatism," and "It's just putting labels on things." They brandish "simplification," "vulgarization," and "formalism" as clubs to try to strike down our workers, peasants, and soldiers' enthusiasm for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. This is all a pipe dream! Our poor and lower-middle peasants have a deeper affection for Chairman Mao's works than the sea is deep. We must study Chairman Mao's works and we must apply them.

	I am sixty-eight years old this year. Looking back over these sixty-eight years, I have known both bitterness and sweetness; both heartache and joy. I hate the old society of horrors, and I love today's happy new society. I hate the landlords, rich peasants, and capitalists who are like wolves and dogs, and I love Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. The past was bitter, but today is sweet. It is Chairman Mao and the Communist Party who have saved us poor and lower-middle peasants from our misery and given us a new heaven and earth. When I think of the old society, I have a bellyful of bitterness to pour out and a heart full of hatred to burn out. It was those wolf-hearted, dog-livered landlords, rich peasants, and capitalists who drank our poor and lower-middle peasants' blood and ate our flesh, skinning us alive. It was the old society of horrors that ruined our families.

	My father was weak from birth and couldn't do heavy work, so my mother had to do needlework to support the family. Things were really tough! My elder brother and elder sister both fell ill and died because we had no money for doctors. My younger sister was only eleven when she was given away as a child bride. My mother, to keep the family alive, had to leave my younger brother, not yet half a year old, to go out and be a wet nurse. Poor little thing, he starved to death. When I was eight, I got a boil on my left side that rotted open to the intestines. I nearly died. After that, I followed my mother around begging for seven whole years, wearing nothing but a pair of patched and mended trousers, suffering endless insults and beatings from the landlords and rich peasants, enduring all the bitterness and hardship of this world. The cold of winter froze my left hand and leg. What kind of world was it for the poor in the old society! When I was fifteen, I had to drag my half-disabled body around to work for the landlords and capitalists, suffering their exploitation and oppression. Whenever I think of this bitter history, I can't hold back my tears of bitterness, and I can't forget the blood debt.

	In 1949, we overthrew the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang and, under Chairman Mao's leadership, fought against the landlords and rich peasants, and divided up the land and houses. That year, I proudly joined the Communist Party of China and was elected deputy village head. From then on, I, a poor peasant, finally emerged from the sea of bitterness and gained liberation. After liberation, Chairman Mao and the Communist Party led us poor and lower-middle peasants onto the broad road of socialism, with production increasing year by year and life getting better and better.

	Thinking of the bitterness of the past and the sweetness of today, how can I forget Chairman Mao? How can I forget the Communist Party? The Party's kindness is greater than the heavens and the earth; Chairman Mao is closer to us than our parents. Chairman Mao is our poor and lower-middle peasants' great savior. We poor and lower-middle peasants will forever follow Chairman Mao in making revolution!

	"The ship of the great sea needs a helmsman, and the revolution needs Mao Zedong Thought." During the Four Clean-ups movement, I began to study Chairman Mao's works. The difficulties were great! The biggest difficulty was that I couldn't read. But I thought of Chairman Mao and of the past class bitterness and blood debt, and I felt full of energy. I went to school and found a teacher to send a student to teach me to read and write and to read Chairman Mao's quotations. Studying the "Three Articles" was even harder because they were full of unfamiliar characters. It took days and countless repetitions for someone to teach me one character, and I still didn't remember it. But I thought of the spirit of the Old Man Moving Mountains, and my energy was even greater. I asked everyone I met, and I studied whenever I had a spare moment. I studied on the way out, on the way in, during the day, and at night. I studied while working and during breaks. I forgot to eat when I was hungry and didn't feel tired at midnight. After more than two years of effort and with the help of many comrades, I can now recite the "Three Articles" and read about a hundred quotations and the latest directives.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Regarding Marxist theory, one must master it and apply it. The purpose of mastery is entirely for application." Vice Chairman Lin says: "Studying Chairman Mao's works, one must study with problems in mind, apply actively, integrate study and use, learn what is urgently needed first, see immediate results, and work hard on the 'use'." Zhang Zedong, White Agnes, Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Li Wenzhong, Men He, and many other heroes are all infinitely loyal soldiers of Chairman Mao, all good examples of actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao's teachings, Vice Chairman Lin's instructions, and the heroes' actual deeds make me understand that studying Chairman Mao's works requires active application and integration of study and use. Loyalty to Chairman Mao is shown in whether one studies and applies. Whether one applies is shown in action. Studying without applying is disloyalty to Chairman Mao. I remember Chairman Mao's teachings and follow the heroes' examples. I do as Chairman Mao says and do as the heroes do.

	Chairman Mao teaches us to "completely" and "thoroughly" serve the people, so I moved to the livestock shed and devoted myself to socialism. Whenever I had free time, I voluntarily cleaned the animal pens, cleaned the toilets, picked up manure, swept the courtyard, filled the manure pits, and participated in digging ditches. In the summer heat, I voluntarily boiled water for the field workers and volunteer laborers and delivered it to them. I serve the poor and lower-middle peasants and do good deeds for socialism without asking for many work points.

	Chairman Mao teaches us to be "selfless and devoted to others" and to have "extreme enthusiasm" for comrades and the people. I donated eighty-plus yuan and seventy-plus jin of grain that I had saved to support the commune's poor households and help class brothers solve their difficulties.

	Chairman Mao teaches us to "criticize the bourgeoisie," so I actively participated in the revolutionary criticism, criticizing China's Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party's reactionary fallacies such as "exploitation is meritorious," "self-management, self-reliance, and self-sufficiency," "four freedoms," "work points in command," and "the theory of the extinction of class struggle."

	Studying Chairman Mao's quotations and the "Three Articles" made me understand how to live and how to make revolution. The more I read, the more I loved reading, the brighter my heart became, and the more revolutionary spirit I had.

	Why do China's Khrushchev and this group of traitors, spies, and capitalist-roaders oppose our workers, peasants, and soldiers studying Chairman Mao's works so desperately? Originally, they are all in cahoots with the landlords, rich peasants, and Chiang Kai-shek. They think of capitalism, speak of capitalism, and do capitalism. They are a group of enemies with stomachs full of teeth more vicious than wolves. Conspiracies fear exposure, ghosts fear the sun, and counter-revolutionary revisionists fear Mao Zedong Thought the most. Once our poor and lower-middle peasants master Mao Zedong Thought, all their conspiracies and tricks will be thoroughly ruined.

	Vice Chairman Lin says: "All our achievements and victories are gained under Chairman Mao's brilliant leadership and are the victories of Mao Zedong Thought." "Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all the work of the whole Party, the whole army, and the whole nation." Chairman Mao's books are the treasured books for our poor and lower-middle peasants and the world's laboring people to rise up and seek liberation. Chairman Mao's words are all spoken from the hearts of our poor and lower-middle peasants, and every sentence is the truth. We must study Chairman Mao's works well and work hard on the "use." With revolutionary actions that integrate study and use, we will criticize and expose the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of China's Khrushchev, criticize it deeply and thoroughly, and uproot this great calamity!

    活学活用毛主席著作，深入持久地开展革命大批判
    昌平县小汤山地区革命大批判文章选登
    谁反对毛泽东思想　谁就是我们的敌人
    大东流公社酸枣岭大队饲养员　郭友存
    以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派，拚命地反对我们工农兵活学活用毛主席著作，胡说“什么问题都到毛主席著作中去找答案，这是教条主义”，是“贴标签”。他们还挥舞着“简单化”、“庸俗化”、“形式主义”等几条棍子，妄想打击我们工农兵活学活用毛主席著作的积极性。这完全是白日做梦！我们贫下中农对毛主席著作的感情，比海还深。毛主席著作我们一定要学，一定要用。
    我今年六十八岁了。回想这六十八年，我又是苦，又是甜；又是心酸，又是喜欢。我恨那万恶的旧社会，我爱今天这幸福的新社会。我恨地主、富农、资本家那些吃人的狗豺狼，我热爱毛主席，热爱共产党。过去是苦，今天是甜，是毛主席、共产党把我们贫下中农从苦难中救了出来，换了新天。提起旧社会，我满肚子的苦水要往外倒，仇恨的怒火要往外烧。就是那些狼心狗肺的地主、富农、资本家喝了我们贫下中农的血，吃了我们贫下中农的肉，把我们贫下中农剥削得皮包骨。就是那万恶的旧社会害得我们家破人亡。
    我爹自小身子骨软，干不了力气活，家中就靠母亲做针线。实在没法过啊！大哥和大弟弟得病没钱瞧，眼睁睁地看着他们死去。妹妹才十一岁就给人家当童养媳。母亲为了一家人活下去，忍痛扔下不满半岁的小弟弟出去当奶妈，可怜的小弟弟就活活地被饿死了。我八岁那年，肚子左边长了个疮，疮口烂得瞅见肠子，险些送了命。以后我就跟着母亲去要饭，整整七年，只穿着一条破了补，补了破的单裤，受尽了地主、富农的污辱和打骂，吃尽了人间的辛酸苦，刺骨的寒天冻坏了我的左手和左腿。旧社会哪是穷人的世道啊！我十五岁以后，不得不拖着半个有残疾的身子，去给地主、资本家扛活、做工，受他们的剥削和欺压。一提这段苦难的家史，就止不住辛酸泪，忘不了血泪仇。
    一九四九年推翻了国民党反动统治，我们在毛主席的领导下，斗争了地主、富农，分田分地又分房。这年我光荣地参加了中国共产党，被选为副村长。从此，我这个贫农出身的受苦人，才跳出了苦海，翻身得解放。解放以后，毛主席、共产党又领着我们贫下中农走上社会主义的康庄大道，生产一年比一年提高，生活一年比一年好。
    想想过去的苦，看看今日的甜，我怎能忘了毛主席？怎能忘了共产党？天大地大不如党的恩情大，爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲。毛主席是我们贫下中农的大救星，我们贫下中农要永远跟着毛主席干革命！
      “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”四清运动中，我开始学毛主席著作。那时的困难可大啦！最大的困难是不识字。可是我想起了毛主席，想起了过去的阶级苦、血泪仇，我浑身都有使不完的劲。我就到学校找老师派个小学生教我识字，教我读毛主席的语录。学习“老三篇”，满篇都是生字，困难更大。一个字人家教我好几天、没数的遍，我还没记住。但是我一想到老愚公移山的精神，劲头就更大了。我见人就问，抓空就学。出门学，进门学，白天学，晚上学，干活打歇时也学。忘了做饭不觉着饿，深更半夜不觉着困。经过两年多的努力和许多同志的帮助，现在我能背“老三篇”，能念一百来条语录和最新指示。
    毛主席教导我们：“对于马克思主义的理论，要能够精通它、应用它，精通的目的全在于应用。”林副主席说：“学习毛主席著作，要带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影，在‘用’字上狠下功夫。”张思德、白求恩、雷锋、王杰、李文忠、门合好多英雄，他们都是无限忠于毛主席的好战士，都是活学活用毛主席著作的好榜样。毛主席的教导，林副主席的指示，英雄们的实际事，使我懂得学习毛主席著作要活学活用，学用结合。对毛主席忠不忠，得看学了用不用。用不用，看行动。学了不用就是对毛主席不忠。我牢记毛主席的教导，学英雄们的好榜样。毛主席咋说我咋办，英雄们咋做我咋做。
    毛主席教导我们要“完全”“彻底”地为人民服务，我就搬到饲养室住，一心扑在社会主义上。一有空闲时间，我就主动地起牲口圈、掏厕所、捡粪、打扫场院、填沤粪坑、参加挖渠。夏天天热，就主动地给下地的社员和义务劳动的工人兄弟烧开水，送开水。为贫下中农服务，为社会主义多作好事，不要多记工分。
    毛主席教导我们要“毫不利己专门利人”，对同志对人民要“极端的热忱”。我就把节省下来的八十多元钱和七十多斤粮食，支援队里的困难户，帮助阶级兄弟解决困难。
    毛主席教导我们要“批判资产阶级”，我就积极参加革命大批判，批判中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮最大的走资派的“剥削有功”、“三自一包”、“四大自由”、“工分挂帅”、“阶级斗争熄灭”论等反动谬论。
    学习毛主席语录和“老三篇”，使我懂得了怎样生活，怎样革命。我越读越爱读，越读心里越豁亮，越读革命劲头越足。
    中国赫鲁晓夫等这群叛徒、特务、走资派，为什么这样一个劲地反对我们工农兵学习毛主席的著作呢？原来，他们都是和地主、富农、蒋介石穿一条裤子。他们想的是资本主义，说的是资本主义，干的还是资本主义。他们是一群肚子长牙比狼还狠的敌人。阴谋怕揭露，鬼怪怕太阳，反革命修正主义分子最怕毛泽东思想。我们贫下中农掌握了毛泽东思想，他们的一切阴谋诡计就彻底完蛋了。
    林副主席说：“我们的一切成就，一切胜利，都是在毛主席的英明领导下取得的，都是毛泽东思想的胜利。”“毛泽东思想是全党、全军和全国一切工作的指导方针。”毛主席的书，是我们贫下中农和世界劳动人民翻身求解放的宝书。毛主席的话，字字说在我们贫下中农的心坎上，句句是真理。我们一定要学习好毛主席著作，在
  “用”字上狠下功夫，以学用一致的革命行动，把中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线批倒批臭，批深批透，除掉这个大祸根！
