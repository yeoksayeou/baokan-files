Thunderous explosions herald the new era, and a mighty east wind sweeps away the remnants of the clouds. Two years ago, our great leader Chairman Mao, with his great revolutionary spirit and extraordinary genius, wrote the epoch-making big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters," issuing the battle cry to attack the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev. Under the great call of Chairman Mao, and under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, the revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses of the whole country, with an irresistible momentum, launched a sustained and fierce attack on the counter-revolutionary bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev. They thoroughly exposed the counter-revolutionary face of China's Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, who represented the interests of the American imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and Kuomintang reactionaries, and smashed this counter-revolutionary bourgeois headquarters hidden within the proletarian dictatorship to smithereens. New revolutionary committees sprang up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain across the land of our motherland. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved great and decisive victories.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Communist Party of China is the core of leadership for the entire Chinese people. Without such a core, the cause of socialism cannot be victorious." In the two years of struggle through storms and waves, we have deeply felt that all our victories have been achieved under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao. At every critical moment in the revolutionary struggle, it is the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao that has pointed out the direction for us to advance, guiding us to brave the storms and waves, cross the rapids and shoals, and advance victoriously along the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao. Loyalty to Chairman Mao is victory, loyalty to the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin is victory.

Chairman Mao is the greatest genius of our time. Chairman Mao has gone through the longest, most complex, most intense, and most multifaceted struggles, and has brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism. Mao Zedong Thought is the science of revolution, the highest truth of the proletariat tested by long-term revolutionary struggles. Only by seriously understanding and resolutely implementing it can we achieve victory. The proletarian headquarters headed by our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin most concentratedly represents the revolutionary will and fundamental interests of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses; it is formed in long-term struggles and is the only correct leadership center tested by time. Our entire Party, army, and nation can have only one such center, not a second one. The class struggle consciousness, the two-line struggle consciousness, and the proletarian sense of unity of our proletarian revolutionary fighters are most fundamentally manifested in our unlimited loyalty to the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, in tightly uniting around this highest headquarters, and in resolutely defending this highest leadership center, bringing all our words and deeds into the revolutionary orbit of Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters. The experience of the Chinese revolution over several decades, especially the experience of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, tells us: resolutely implementing the orders of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao means invincibility and unassailable strength. Conversely, if we deviate even slightly from the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, think we know better, and replace the instructions of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao with our own assumptions, we will definitely take the wrong path, definitely make big mistakes, and cause losses to the revolution. Unlimited loyalty to the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao is the fundamental need of the proletariat and the fundamental guarantee of revolutionary victory.

The closer the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution gets to overall victory, the more complex and acute the class struggle becomes. A handful of class enemies, unwilling to see the victorious development of the Cultural Revolution, will always try every means to sabotage and disrupt, appearing in ultra-leftist or rightist disguises to oppose the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao. The so-called "multi-center theory" just happens to meet the needs of the class enemies.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must build a centralized and unified Party. All unprincipled factional struggles must be eliminated. We must make the steps of the whole Party uniform and consistent, and strive for one common goal. We must oppose individualism and sectarianism." Currently, some people, starting from bourgeois factionalism and the interests of small groups, disrupt the centralized unity under the leadership of Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters, and deal with issues not by the standard of Mao Zedong Thought, Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and the instructions of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, but by the needs of their personal or small group interests. They even defy the commands and instructions of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao. This is a kind of "multi-center theory." Those who advocate the so-called "multi-center theory" are not truly advocating "multiple centers," but rather want to be the center themselves, rather than the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, the only leadership center. The "multi-center theory" is a variant of the already discredited factionalism and sectarianism, a malignant expansion of bourgeois individualism, and a manifestation of the bourgeois egoist worldview. The so-called "multi-center theory" is a reactionary theory of bourgeois factionalism and individualism, and must be thoroughly criticized.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All comrades in the Party must unite around the Central Committee. Any behavior that disrupts unity is a crime." Our unity is unity centered on the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao. With this unity, we can defeat any enemy, overcome any difficulty, and create any miracle. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will definitely achieve overall victory. The "multi-center theory" disperses the unity of the revolutionary ranks on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought. If every department and unit wants to be the center, and there are many centers across the country, the result is no center. This is essentially rightist opportunism and splitism.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Discipline is the guarantee for implementing the line." Countless struggles have proven that to implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, we must strengthen revolutionary organizational discipline, resolutely follow the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, and resolutely implement the instructions of Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters. Chairman Mao has long pointed out deeply: "We must resolutely overcome the state of indiscipline or anarchism that exists in many places, that is, arbitrarily modifying the policies and strategies of the Central Committee or higher Party committees, and implementing extremely harmful policies and strategies that violate the unified will and unified discipline; ... This state of affairs causes enormous damage to revolutionary interests." Those who advocate the "multi-center theory" disrupt revolutionary organizational discipline. They do not seriously study Chairman Mao's instructions, do not seriously implement the commands of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, and even distort the highest instructions, interfering with and obstructing Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments. This greatly hinders the implementation of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

"Never forget class struggle." It is precisely by using some people in our ranks whose bourgeois worldviews have not been transformed that class enemies promote the idea of "I am the center" and the "multi-center theory." If this thought is allowed to develop unchecked and not corrected, it will inevitably lead to the path of separating from and even opposing the proletarian headquarters. We must use the mirror of Mao Zedong Thought to timely expose the conspiracies of class enemies who spread rumors and sow discord, and smash the desperate struggles of the dying handful of class enemies.

"Opportunists who try to stop the tide, though almost everywhere, cannot stop the tide." In the history of the Chinese revolution, those who opposed Chairman Mao's wise leadership and wanted to be the center themselves all collapsed and were punished by history. In the day when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has already achieved decisive victories, some people, with swollen heads, still want to promote what "I am the center" and the "multi-center theory." If these people do not resolutely decide to use Mao Zedong Thought to transform their bourgeois worldviews, they will definitely slide into a dangerous pit!

The situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is excellent and getting better. Our socialist motherland is thriving. Our proletarian dictatorship is stronger than ever. At the moment of seizing the overall victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it is especially necessary for us to be infinitely loyal to the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. We are determined to forever be loyal to our great leader Chairman Mao, forever loyal to the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, and tightly unite around this leadership center. For every new instruction from Chairman Mao, we will strive to study, resolutely carry out, and thoroughly implement it. We will implement what we understand and also implement what we temporarily do not understand, deepening our understanding in the process of implementation. Fully implementing Chairman Mao's new instructions is the overall victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must strive to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, especially to study and apply Chairman Mao's series of new instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must use what we learn and apply it, learning a little and using a little, focusing on the "use" aspect. Following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, we will unite our will, unite our steps, and unite our actions, and strive forward courageously to seize the overall victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

　　永远忠于以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部
　　空军直属机关　红群文
    千钧霹雳开新宇，万里东风扫残云。两年前，我们伟大领袖毛主席以他伟大的革命气魄和卓越的天才，写下了具有划时代意义的大字报《炮打司令部》，发出了炮打以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部的战斗号令。全国的无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，在毛主席的伟大号令下，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的领导下，以排山倒海之势，向以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的反革命的资产阶级司令部发动了持续的猛烈的进攻，彻底揭穿了中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派代表美帝、苏修、国民党反动派利益的反革命面目，把这个隐藏在无产阶级专政内部的反革命的资产阶级司令部打得落花流水。新生的革命委员会象雨后春笋般地在祖国的大地上联翩出现。无产阶级文化大革命取得了伟大的决定性的胜利。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“中国共产党是全中国人民的领导核心。没有这样一个核心，社会主义事业就不能胜利。”在这两年斗争的大风大浪中，我们最深刻地体会到，我们的一切胜利，都是在以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的领导下取得的。在革命斗争的每一个关键时刻，都是以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部给我们指明了前进的方向，指引我们战狂风、斗恶浪，越过激流险滩，沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利前进。忠于毛主席就是胜利，忠于以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部就是胜利。
    毛主席是当代最伟大的天才。毛主席经历了最长期、最复杂、最激烈、最多方面的斗争，天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义。毛泽东思想是革命的科学，是经过长期革命斗争考验的无产阶级的最高真理。只有认真领会，坚决贯彻，我们才能取得胜利。以伟大领袖毛主席为首和他的亲密战友林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，最集中地代表了无产阶级和广大革命人民群众的革命意志和根本利益；它是在长期斗争中形成的，是久经考验的唯一正确的领导中心。我们全党、全军、全国只能有这样一个中心，不能有第二个中心。我们无产阶级革命战士的阶级斗争觉悟，两条路线斗争觉悟，无产阶级的整体观念，最根本的是表现在无限忠于毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，紧紧地团结在这个最高司令部的周围，坚决保卫这个最高的领导中心，把我们的一言一行都纳入毛主席的无产阶级司令部的革命轨道。中国革命几十年的经验，特别是无产阶级文化大革命的经验告诉我们：坚决贯彻执行以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的号令，就战无不胜，攻无不克。反之，如果稍微背离了以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的领导，自以为是，以想当然代替毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的指示，就一定要走上邪路，一定要犯大错误，给革命造成损失。无限忠于以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，是无产阶级利益的根本需要，是革命胜利的根本保证。
    无产阶级文化大革命越是接近全面胜利，阶级斗争越是复杂，越是尖锐。一小撮阶级敌人不甘心文化大革命的胜利发展，他们总是要千方百计地进行破坏和捣乱，以极“左”的或右的面貌出现，来反对以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部。而所谓“多中心论”，正好适应了阶级敌人的需要。
      毛主席教导我们：“我们一定要建设一个集中的统一的党，一切无原则的派别斗争，都要清除干净。要使我们全党的步调整齐一致，为一个共同目标而奋斗，我们一定要反对个人主义和宗派主义。”当前，有的人从资产阶级派性、从小团体利益出发，破坏毛主席的无产阶级司令部领导下的集中统一，对待问题不是以毛泽东思想、毛主席的革命路线、以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的指示为标准，而是以他个人或小团体的需要为标准，甚至违抗以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的命令和指示，这就是一种“多中心论”。搞所谓“多中心论”的人，并不是真要搞“多中心”，而是要“以我为中心”，而不要以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部这个唯一的领导中心。“多中心论”是已经搞臭了的山头主义、宗派主义的变种，是资产阶级个人主义的恶性膨胀，是资产阶级唯我主义世界观的表现。所谓“多中心论”，是一种资产阶级山头主义、个人主义的反动理论，必须彻底批判。
      毛主席教导我们：“全党同志必须团结在中央的周围，任何破坏团结的行为都是罪恶”。我们的团结，是以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部为中心的团结。有了这个团结，就任何敌人都能战胜，任何困难都能克服，任何奇迹都能创造，无产阶级文化大革命就一定能取得全面胜利。“多中心论”，涣散革命队伍在毛泽东思想基础上的团结。如果各个部门、各个单位都要“以我为中心”，全国有许多个“中心”，结果是无中心。这实质上就是右倾分裂主义。
      毛主席教导我们：“纪律是执行路线的保证”。无数斗争经验证明，要贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就要加强革命的组织纪律性，坚决服从以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的领导，坚决贯彻毛主席的无产阶级司令部的指示。毛主席早就深刻地指出：“必须坚决地克服许多地方存在着的某些无纪律状态或无政府状态，即擅自修改中央的或上级党委的政策和策略，执行他们自以为是的违背统一意志和统一纪律的极端有害的政策和策略；……这种状态，给予革命利益的损害，极为巨大。”搞“多中心论”的人，破坏革命的组织纪律，他们不认真学习毛主席指示，不认真执行以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的命令，甚至歪曲最高指示，干扰和阻挠毛主席的伟大战略部署。这就极大地妨碍了毛主席革命路线的贯彻执行。
      “千万不要忘记阶级斗争。”阶级敌人正是利用我们队伍中的一些资产阶级世界观没有改造好的人搞“以我为中心”，搞“多中心论”，这种思想如果任其发展下去而不改正，就必然会走到脱离以至对抗无产阶级司令部的错误的道路上去。我们必须用毛泽东思想的照妖镜，及时识破阶级敌人造谣诬蔑、挑拨离间的阴谋，粉碎穷途末路的一小撮阶级敌人的垂死挣扎。
      “想要阻挡潮流的机会主义者虽然几乎到处都有，潮流总是阻挡不住的”。在中国革命的历史上，有的人对抗毛主席的英明领导，要以他们自己为中心，结果都垮台了，受到了历史的惩罚。在无产阶级文化大革命已经取得了决定性胜利的今天，有的人头脑膨胀，还想搞什么“以我为中心”、什么“多中心论”，这些人如果不痛下决心，用毛泽东思想改造自己的资产阶级世界观，必定要滑到危险的泥坑里去的！
    无产阶级文化大革命的形势一片大好，越来越好。我们的社会主义祖国欣欣向荣。我们的无产阶级专政空前巩固。在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的时刻，特别需要我们对以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的无限忠诚。我们决心永远忠于伟大领袖毛主席，永远忠于以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，紧紧团结在这个领导中心周围。对毛主席的每一个最新指示，都努力学习、坚决照办、彻底执行。理解的要执行，暂时不理解的也要执行，在执行过程中加深理解。全面落实毛主席的最新指示，就是无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。我们一定要努力活学活用毛泽东思想，特别是要学好用好毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的一系列最新指示，学了就要用，学一点用一点，在“用”字上狠下功夫。紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的领导下，统一意志，统一步伐，统一行动，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利而奋勇前进！
