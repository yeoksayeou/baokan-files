Shanghai Xuhui District Revolutionary Committee Summarizes and Reviews the Work of Reforming the Organs

The army must be streamlined and the bureaucracy simplified. The revolutionary committee of Shanghai's Xuhui District, in accordance with Chairman Mao's great teaching of "In this round of streamlining and simplifying, we must achieve the five goals of streamlining, unification, efficiency, economy, and combating bureaucracy," recently summarized and reviewed the work of streamlining and simplifying in the previous stage, and made further concrete and effective improvements. Through the summary and review, they severely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line that Liu Shaoqi (referred to as "Chinese Khrushchev" in the article) promoted in the construction of the political power, broke through the metaphysical and pedantic philosophy in the work of the organs, enabled the staff to break away from the circle of trivial matters, deeply entered the grassroots level and the frontline of class struggle, strengthened the close connection with the broad masses, and made the entire revolutionary committee more vigorous and full of vitality. It became a command center for propagating Mao Zedong Thought and leading the broad revolutionary masses to launch a fierce attack on the class enemies.

Shanghai's Xuhui District is a large district with a population of over 500,000. Soon after the establishment of the new district revolutionary committee in November last year, it followed Chairman Mao's great teaching of "streamlining and simplifying" and carried out a thorough reform of the old organizations. The new organs set up by the district revolutionary committee had more than 80% fewer staff than the old district committee and the old district people's committee, taking the first step towards "organizing a revolutionary and people-oriented leadership team." However, due to the lingering influence of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line that Liu Shaoqi promoted in the construction of the political power, after the streamlining of the organizations and personnel, some old metaphysical and pedantic work methods and styles were still retained. Unnecessary forms, documents, and paperwork hindered the staff from better highlighting proletarian politics and connecting with the masses. They spent a lot of time in meetings and buried themselves in paperwork, unable to go out. Some people, even if they went out, only "skated on the surface," listening to reports in the offices of the grassroots revolutionary committees and copying numbers. The masses had strong opinions about these phenomena and enthusiastically put forward criticisms and suggestions for improvement.

The district revolutionary committee summarized and reviewed the above situations and problems, re-studied Chairman Mao's series of teachings and latest instructions on streamlining and simplifying, and unanimously deeply realized that streamlining and simplifying were not just about merging organizations and reducing personnel. It was necessary to severely criticize Liu Shaoqi's revisionist line, quickly eliminate its influence, and eliminate the old ideas and styles of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes. Only in this way could Chairman Mao's great goal of "the reform of state organs, the most fundamental thing, is to connect with the masses" be truly achieved.

After raising their awareness, the Xuhui District Revolutionary Committee immediately launched a thorough criticism and struggle, mobilizing the revolutionary cadres and masses of the entire district, as well as the cadres of the organs, to jointly criticize the serious crimes of the handful of capitalist roaders within the party who turned the state power organs into bureaucratic offices. They listed a large number of facts through their personal experiences, exposing and denouncing the evil consequences of Liu Shaoqi's promotion of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the construction of the political power. On this basis, the district revolutionary committee mobilized the cadres of the organs to take "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key, and denounced the corruption and poisoning of the revisionist line of political construction on themselves. In the thorough criticism and struggle, the revolutionary committee members and the staff's class struggle awareness and two-line struggle awareness were greatly enhanced, and they became more determined and confident in taking the road of "streamlining and simplifying."

Through the thorough criticism and struggle, the Xuhui District Revolutionary Committee broke through the metaphysical and pedantic philosophy, better highlighted proletarian politics in their work, and firmly grasped the root of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. The district revolutionary committee established an unshakable system of studying Chairman Mao's works. They studied with problems from the struggle, applied the teachings actively, promoted the struggle and work of the entire district, and continuously promoted their own thought revolutionization. The district revolutionary committee regarded leading the revolutionary masses of the entire district to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought as the top priority. The leading cadres and staff, when going down to the grassroots, first understood the situation of the revolutionary masses studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, what experiences they had and what problems they encountered; at the same time, they firmly grasped the advanced examples, set up models, and promoted the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the entire district to continuously develop.

They followed the battle commands of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin more closely. Every time the proletarian headquarters issued a battle command, the Xuhui District Revolutionary Committee acted swiftly, transmitted it to the masses with the fastest speed and in a comprehensive and accurate manner, and implemented it with their own actions. In February this year, the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, required all districts and counties to quickly achieve the three-in-one combination of revolution. The Xuhui District Revolutionary Committee acted immediately, from the leading members to the staff, fearing no difficulties and no fatigue, fighting together with the revolutionary cadres of the entire district, thoroughly criticized bourgeois factionalism, and quickly helped all grassroots units in the district that had not established revolutionary committees to achieve the three-in-one combination, becoming the first district in the entire city to achieve a red area.

Through the thorough criticism and struggle, the Xuhui District Revolutionary Committee broke through the metaphysical and pedantic philosophy, and while streamlining the army, firmly grasped the simplification of the bureaucracy. They repeatedly discussed and practiced, greatly simplified documents, forms, and paperwork, reduced meetings, and abolished tedious work systems. The district revolutionary committee now, except for the written documents and forms that must be reported to the higher authorities, has canceled all the rest. For the grassroots level, except for a very small number of matters that need them to fill out forms and write reports, the rest have also been canceled. Many meetings are directly transmitted to the grassroots level, avoiding layer-by-layer transmission and layer-by-layer deployment. The leading members of the district revolutionary committee spend most of their time at the grassroots level, maintaining close contact with the masses, and directly grasping the first-hand materials. Because they understand the demands, emotions, and experiences of the masses, the system of layer-by-layer reporting has been abolished. Opening meetings and making reports no longer need secretaries to draft speeches. In the past, the old organizations often required the grassroots level to write reports and summaries. After the grassroots level sent the materials up, they would "travel" for a long time among the higher-level leaders and departments, bothering the grassroots level and fatiguing the masses. Now, when the grassroots level has problems that need to be solved or new creations that need to be promoted, the leading members and staff of the district revolutionary committee go directly to help solve the problems and summarize the experiences. Sometimes the district revolutionary committee directly holds an expanded meeting of the standing committee in the units that have created advanced experiences, quickly spreading the advanced experiences, and timely promoting the struggle of various units, fundamentally changing the previous phenomenon of the grassroots level serving the organs, rather than the organs serving the grassroots level. Now, in Xuhui District, more people go deep into the grassroots level, fewer people stay in the office; more people study and solve problems at the grassroots level, fewer people engage in "paper talk" at the top; more people enthusiastically receive the masses, fewer people are indifferent to the masses.

    上海徐汇区革命委员会总结检查机关改革工作
    精兵必须简政
    狠批中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面的反革命修正主义路线，大破机关工作中的形而上学和烦琐哲学，使办事人员跳出事务圈子，更好地活学活用毛主席著作，使革委会更加密切联系群众，更加朝气勃勃
      新华社上海电　上海市徐汇区革命委员会遵照毛主席“在这次精兵简政中，必须达到精简、统一、效能、节约和反对官僚主义五项目的”的伟大教导，最近对前一阶段的精兵简政工作进行了总结检查，并且进一步作了切实有效的改进。通过总结检查，他们狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面推行的反革命修正主义路线，大破机关工作中的形而上学和烦琐哲学，使办事人员摆脱了烦琐的事务圈子，深入基层，深入阶级斗争第一线，加强了同广大群众的密切联系，整个革委会的工作更加朝气勃勃，成为宣传毛泽东思想，带领广大革命群众不断向阶级敌人展开猛烈进攻的战斗指挥部。
    上海徐汇区是拥有五十多万人口的大区。去年十一月份新生的区革委会成立后不久，就遵照毛主席“精兵简政”的伟大教导，对旧机构进行了大刀阔斧的改革。区革委会设置的新机构，办事人员比旧区委、旧区人委的工作人员少百分之八十以上，朝着“组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子”的目标，迈出了第一步。但是，由于中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面所推行的反革命修正主义路线的流毒没有肃清，在机构和人员精简以后，仍然保留了一些旧的形而上学和烦琐哲学的工作方法与工作作风。不必要的报表、公文、文牍等等烦琐的事务，阻碍着办事人员更好地突出无产阶级政治，使他们不能更好地联系群众。他们把许多时间花在会议上，埋头在文牍中，出不去；有的人即使出去了，也是“蜻蜓点水”，到基层革委会办公室听听汇报，抄抄数字。群众对这些现象很有意见，热情地提出了批评和改进建议。
    区革委会总结检查了上面这些情况和问题，重温了毛主席关于精兵简政的一系列教导和最新指示，一致深刻认识到，精兵简政决不是并并机构和减减人员就万事大吉了。必须狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义路线，迅速消除其流毒，必须破除资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的旧观念、旧作风。只有这样，才能真正实现毛主席所教导的“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众”的伟大目标。
    认识提高以后，徐汇区革委会立即狠抓革命大批判，发动全区无产阶级革命派、革命群众和机关干部，一起来批判党内一小撮走资派把国家政权机构搞成官僚衙门的严重罪行。他们通过具体感受，并且列举了大量事实，控诉、揭露了中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设方面推行反革命修正主义路线所造成的恶果。在这个基础上，区革委会又发动机关干部以“斗私，批修”为纲，控诉了修正主义建政路线对自己的腐蚀和毒害。他们在革命大批判中把旧机构中修正主义的流毒，归结为“五大害”：一害：大搞庞杂机构，反对一元化领导，反对突出无产阶级政治。二害：人浮于事，用修正主义思想腐蚀干部，为资本主义复辟在组织上准备条件。三害：政出多门，疲劳群众，要基层为机关服务。四害：互相扯皮，遇事推来推去，不负责任，不解决群众提出的问题，不关心群众疾苦。五害：会议多，报表多，大搞文牍主义，严重脱离群众。
    通过这些活动，革委会成员和办事人员的阶级斗争觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟大大提高，更加坚定了走“精兵简政”道路的决心和信心。
    通过革命的大批判，徐汇区革委会大破了形而上学、烦琐哲学，在工作中更好地突出了无产阶级政治，狠抓了活学活用毛泽东思想这个根本。区革委会建立了雷打不动的学习毛主席著作的制度。他们带着斗争中的问题学，活学活用，推动全区的斗争和工作，不断促进自己思想革命化。区革委会把领导好全区革命群众活学活用毛泽东思想当作头等重要的大事。领导人员和办事人员下去，首先了解革命群众活学活用毛泽东思想的情况，有什么经验和存在什么问题；同时，狠抓先进典型，树立标兵，推动全区活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动不断向前发展。
    对以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的每一个战斗号令，跟得更紧了。无产阶级司令部每发出一个战斗号令，徐汇区革委会都雷厉风行，以最快的速度，全面准确地“一竿子插到底”，传达到群众，并且身体力行，带头贯彻，坚决照办。今年二月间，上海市革委会紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，要求各区、县迅速实现革命三结合。徐汇区革委会闻风而动，从领导成员到办事人员，不怕困难、不怕疲劳，同全区无产阶级革命派战斗在一起，彻底批判了资产阶级派性，很快帮助全区所有未建立革委会的基层单位全部实现了革命三结合，在全市十个区中第一个实现了一片红。
    徐汇区革委会通过革命大批判，破除了形而上学和烦琐哲学，在精兵的同时，狠抓了简政这一环节。他们经过反复讨论和实践，大大简化了公文、报表、文牍，精简了会议，取消了烦琐的工作制度。区革委会现在除了必须向上级报告的书面文件、报表以外，其余的全部砍掉。对于基层，除了极少量的事需要他们填报表、写报告以外，其他也都取消了。许多会议都是一竿子插到底，避免层层传达、层层布置。区革委会领导成员大部分时间在基层活动，和群众保持密切联系，直接掌握第一手材料。由于他们了解群众的要求、群众的情绪、群众的经验，因此，层层听汇报的制度，被废除了。开会做报告，根本不需要秘书起草讲话稿件。过去旧机构动不动要基层写报告、做总结，当基层把材料送上来以后，又在上面的领导人员之间和部门之间长期“旅行”，麻烦基层，疲劳群众。现在，基层有什么问题需要解决，有什么新的创造值得推广，区革委会领导成员和办事人员就直接到那里去帮助解决问题和总结经验。有时候区革委会就直接在创造先进经验的单位召开常委扩大会议，迅速把先进经验传播开去，及时推动各单位的斗争，从根本上改变了过去基层为机关服务，而不是机关为基层服务的本末倒置的现象。现在，徐汇区革委会深入基层的人多了，坐办公室的人少了；在基层研究解决问题的多了，坐在上面“纸上谈兵”的少了；热情接待群众的多了，对群众漠不关心的少了。
