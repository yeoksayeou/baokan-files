The night was already deep. In the Xiniqi area of the Greater Khingan Range in Inner Mongolia, 83-year-old Grandma Zhao was still studying one word at a time: "Those who have infiltrated the Party, the government, the army, and various cultural circles are a bunch of revisionist counter-revolutionaries. Once the time is ripe, they will seize power, turning proletarian dictatorship into bourgeois dictatorship."

In 1961, the Chinese Khrushchev personally came to this small mountain village to advocate for "money as the guiding principle" and "material incentives," turning the place into a mess. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the families of the workers in the village, with a heart dedicated to defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, launched a great exposure, struggle, and criticism against the bourgeois headquarters' reactionary line, achieving brilliant results. However, the few loyal followers of the Chinese Khrushchev who were exposed by the revolutionary masses have recently been visiting homes, spreading rumors, and even publicly crying injustice.

How did this rightist reversal wind start? In the study class for the families of the workers, Grandma Zhao said: "In my opinion, those bad guys are like grasshoppers in autumn, bound to jump around. This is one aspect. Another aspect is that our street criticism here doesn't focus on the criticism, can't hit their hearts, and thus can't criticize deeply." Grandma Zhao's words reminded everyone. Through in-depth study of Chairman Mao's theory, line, principles, and policies on continuing the revolution under proletarian dictatorship, they realized: to criticize them deeply and thoroughly, politically, ideologically, and theoretically, to overthrow and expose them, so they can never rise again.

Since that day, the families of the workers in the Xiniqi Forestry Farm, following the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "not fighting a battle without preparation," prepared in advance and held two criticism sessions per week. Today, while Grandma Zhao was preparing intensively, Guo's daughter-in-law was also teaching her, "False is false, and the disguise should be peeled off"; Tang's sister was feeding her child while reciting, "Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction is criticism, is revolution"; the elderly Wang in the nursing home couldn't calm down, "chack, chack" smoking a pipe, repeatedly pondering the profound meaning of the great teaching, "The rights obtained by the people must not be easily lost and must be defended with struggle." Every household in the village had lights on, and the families of the workers were studying Mao Zedong Thought intensively, preparing for tomorrow's street criticism meeting.

As soon as the sun set, the criticism armies of the families of the workers set out. From children to the elderly, they surrounded a small group of capitalist roaders in the street. Grandma Zhao pointed at them with her cane, gnashing her teeth, "You bunch of bad guys are cut from the same mold as the Chinese Khrushchev, opening your stinking mouths and talking about nothing but money. Money! Money! Money! You want me to think about money and forget about power, so you can secretly grab the seal. In the old society, I was a maid for the landlord at the age of ten. In the new society, I am over eighty and can still read Chairman Mao's revolutionary books. I know which path is good and which is bad. You want to take our power? Forget it!" Guo's mother-in-law exposed the old tricks of the class enemy pushing "profit as the guiding principle," saying, "You want our working class to go back on the old road, suffer twice, and endure twice the hardship, which is absolutely impossible." Tang's sister peeled off the class enemy's disguise of "material incentives," saying, "Using small 'sweets' to lead us to suffer great hardships, generation after generation serving you reactionaries as cattle and horses, is a vain hope!" The elderly Wang from the nursing home led everyone to shout over and over, "This case will never be overturned in ten thousand generations!"

The street criticism meetings of the families of the workers in the Xiniqi Forestry Farm became a large classroom for popularizing Mao Zedong Thought. The movement of learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought that arose during the criticism greatly changed people's spiritual outlook, with everyone spirited and full of fighting spirit, truly "the scenery here is unique."

    街头批判会
    夜，已经很深了。在内蒙古大兴安岭林区的西尼气，八十三岁的赵老大娘，还在一字一句地学着：“混进党里、政府里、军队里和各种文化界的资产阶级代表人物，是一批反革命的修正主义分子，一旦时机成熟，他们就会要夺取政权，由无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。”
    一九六一年，中国赫鲁晓夫亲自到这个小小的山村来鼓吹过“金钱挂帅”、“物质刺激”，把这里搞得乌烟瘴气。在无产阶级文化大革命中，屯上的职工家属们怀着誓死保卫毛主席无产阶级革命路线的一颗红心，对资产阶级司令部推行的资产阶级反动路线，展开了大揭发，大斗争，大批判，取得了辉煌战果。可是，被革命群众揪出来的中国赫鲁晓夫的一小撮忠实走卒，近来，又走东家，串西家，到处放风，甚至公开喊冤叫屈了。
    这阵右倾翻案风是怎么刮起来的？在职工家属学习班里，赵老大娘说：“依我看，那帮坏家伙是秋后蚂蚱，非蹦跶两下不可。这是一面。另外，还有一面，咱屯里的街头大批判，不在批判上下功夫，打不到他们的心窝，就批不深。”赵老大娘的一句话，提醒了大伙，他们通过深入学习毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的理论、路线、方针、政策，认识到：要从政治上、思想上、理论上把他们批深批透，批倒批臭，叫他们永世不得翻身。
    自从那天起，西尼气林场职工家属们遵循伟大领袖毛主席“不打无把握之仗”的伟大教导，事先做好准备，每周批判两次。今天，赵老大娘正在紧张准备的时候，郭大娘的媳妇也在教她学“假的就是假的，伪装应当剥去”；唐大嫂一边喂孩子，一边背诵“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命”；敬老院的王大爷心情怎么也平静不下来，他“叭嗒、叭嗒”抽着旱烟，反复地琢磨“人民得到的权利，绝不允许轻易丧失，必须用战斗来保卫”这一伟大教导的深刻意义。整个屯子里家家户户都亮着灯，职工家属们加紧学习毛泽东思想，准备迎接明天的街头批判会。
    太阳刚刚下山，职工家属区一支支批判大军出动了。从小孩到老人，把一小撮走资派团团包围在大街上。赵老大娘恨得咬牙切齿，用拐杖指着他们的鼻子说：“你们这帮坏蛋和中国赫鲁晓夫是一个模子刻出来的，张开臭嘴离不了一个钱字。钱！钱！钱！想让俺想着钱，忘了权，你们好偷偷摸摸地把大印抓过去。旧社会，我十岁就给地主当丫环。新社会，我八十多岁了，还能念上毛主席写的革命书。那条道好，那条道坏，俺心里有数。你们想夺俺们的权，就死了那条心吧！”郭大娘揭了阶级敌人推行“利润挂帅”的老底，她说：“想让俺工人阶级走回头路，吃二遍苦，受二茬罪，万万办不到。”唐大嫂剥了阶级敌人搞“物质刺激”的画皮，她说：“用小‘甜头’，引着我们吃大苦头，祖祖辈辈给你们这些反动派当牛当马，是妄想！”敬老院里的王大爷一遍又一遍地领着大家喊：“这个案，一万辈子也翻不了！”
    西尼气林场职工家属的街头大批判，成了普及毛泽东思想的大课堂。在大批判中兴起的活学活用毛泽东思想运动，极大地改变了人们的精神面貌，个个精神振奋，斗志昂扬，真是“风景这边独好”。
