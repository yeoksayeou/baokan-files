Vice Chairman Lin Biao has instructed us: "We must, through the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works, instill Mao Zedong Thought into workers and peasants, so as to change the spiritual outlook of the laboring people, and to transform spiritual strength into tremendous material force." The leadership of the West Old Spring Production Brigade in Comrade Public Commune, Licheng County, Shandong Province, with the help of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team from a certain unit of the Jinan Military Region, has led the masses in establishing Mao Zedong Thought Family Study Classes, organizing men, women, old, and young to actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and fully implement Chairman Mao's series of latest directives. People's spiritual outlook has undergone a profound change. Recently, we visited this brigade with excited and moved hearts to investigate and interview the masses about the situation of establishing Mao Zedong Thought Family Study Classes, combating selfishness and criticizing revisionism, and promoting the revolutionization of thought.

Establishing Mao Zedong Thought Family Study Classes to Occupy the Home Front

The Mao Zedong Thought Family Study Classes in the West Old Spring Production Brigade were established in the midst of the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads.

In March of this year, a cadre from a production team, due to some shortcomings and errors in his work, was criticized by the poor and lower-middle peasants. He felt that being a cadre was not worth the effort and declared that he would not serve anymore. Later, the brigade leadership educated him, and he acknowledged his mistake, expressing his willingness to serve the poor and lower-middle peasants well. However, upon returning home, his wife pulled him back. This incident affected his thoughts.

There was another incident: During a meeting held by the production brigade to criticize Liu Shaoqi and his agents, the militia company commander Zhang Rongfu led the way in exposing a bad element. This bad element, while appearing to confess his crimes during the meeting, continued to play tricks afterward, going to Zhang Rongfu's home and hypocritically saying to Zhang Rongfu's father, "We're fellow villagers, if there's anything that can't be resolved, just let Rongfu talk about it at home and that's it." Zhang Rongfu's father, after hearing the bad element's words, told his son, "In the future, you should mind your own business!"

The above incidents raised a sharp question for the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army and the brigade leadership: Why did that cadre change his mind after returning home? Why did that bad element dare to cause trouble in the militia company commander's home? With this question in mind, they repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's relevant teachings. Chairman Mao said: "If socialism does not occupy the rural areas, capitalism will inevitably occupy them." Through study, they realized: The family is a legacy from thousands of years of private ownership. Although it is now a socialist society, the poison of the old thoughts of the exploiting classes still runs deep in some families. If Mao Zedong Thought does not occupy this front, the family will become a shelter and a haven for the bourgeois "self," and will be used by class enemies to exploit loopholes. Therefore, this front must be occupied and transformed by Mao Zedong Thought. At the same time, organizing the masses to study Chairman Mao's works with the family as a unit is also conducive to organizing men, women, old, and young into the mass movement of actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and to better achieve the widespread promotion of Mao Zedong Thought. All of this deeply educated everyone: Mao Zedong Thought Family Study Classes must be established.

Establishing Mao Zedong Thought Family Study Classes Relies on Loyalty to Chairman Mao

Chairman Mao said: "The growth of any new thing is bound to be fraught with difficulties and twists and turns." The West Old Spring Production Brigade encountered obstacles from class enemies and old habits when establishing Mao Zedong Thought Family Study Classes. Class enemies were terrified and hated the masses' establishment of Mao Zedong Thought Family Study Classes, spreading rumors and slandering, saying things like, "During busy times, holding these classes is good; having some free time to rest is even better." They slandered the masses for actively establishing study classes as "trying to climb up to become cadres." Some masses, bound by old habits, also thought, "A family of several generations, with grandparents, daughters-in-law, uncles, and nieces sitting together to expose and criticize their selfishness, can't open their mouths"; others thought, "Establishing study classes is the cadres' job, with old people and young people in the family, how can it be done?" Facing this situation, the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army and the brigade leadership members repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle and class enemies, realizing: The broad poor and lower-middle peasants have limitless love for Chairman Mao. As long as Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle are used to arm the poor and lower-middle peasants, the class struggle consciousness of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants is raised high, proletarian feelings are deepened, and a firm "loyalty" to the great leader Chairman Mao is established in the hearts of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, all obstacles can be overcome, and Mao Zedong Thought Family Study Classes can be established.

The following is an introduction to the establishment and development of three family study classes, which shows that the recognition of the Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team and the brigade leadership is correct.

The third production team member Guo Deyuan's family has an elderly mother, wife, sister-in-law, and four children, totaling eight people. When they first established the family study class, they encountered many obstacles. Through reminiscing and comparing, they raised their consciousness, removed obstacles, and became one of the families in the production brigade where the Mao Zedong Thought Family Study Classes were established relatively well.

In March of this year, Guo Deyuan returned from the production brigade's Mao Zedong Thought Study Class and resolutely responded to the great leader Chairman Mao's call to actively establish family study classes. However, Guo's mother initially did not understand and said, "With so many old and young people, none of us can read a single character, what's the use of establishing a study class?" Guo Deyuan remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: "Class struggle, once grasped, is effective." He asked his mother to recount the bitter history of the family. When recalling the bitter old society, Guo's mother said with tears, "If we talk about the suffering of the poor in the past, three days and nights wouldn't be enough! Just take the year 1941, for example. That was a year of severe famine. Our family's meager six mu of land was seized by the landlord, forcing us seven family members to flee for our lives. You were just eleven years old then, leading your younger sister to flee for your lives. I pulled your second brother and carried your third brother, begging for food everywhere. Your grandfather was left at home, sick in bed, with no one to take care of him. That year, your grandfather and father starved to death, and I was forced to sell your third brother. Later, we were so poor that we couldn't open the pot, and we sent your seven-year-old sister to be a child bride..."

At this point, Guo's mother couldn't hold back her tears, and the whole family cried. Then, the whole family discussed the happy life after liberation, from fighting landlords and distributing land to walking the path of cooperation and people's communes, one by one, discussing and feeling more and more that the party's kindness was greater than the heavens and the earth, and more and more that parents' love was not as great as Chairman Mao's love. Guo's mother excitedly said, "With Chairman Mao, there is our family!" Guo Deyuan, seeing that his mother's thoughts had opened up, followed up, "Chairman Mao calls on us to establish study classes, we must quickly establish the family study class." Guo's mother replied, "What Chairman Mao says, we will definitely follow."

After Guo Deyuan's family established the study class, every evening the whole family gathered in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, studied Chairman Mao's works, and engaged in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism. The spiritual outlook of the whole family was renewed.

Under the large walnut tree at the village entrance, the first production team's poor peasant member Chen Qingying lives with his family. Chen Qingying is forty years old, with eight children in front of him, the eldest being nineteen and the youngest just two years old. This spring, the whole family of ten established a Mao Zedong Thought Study Class. From this family's study class, one can see how the members of the West Old Spring Brigade, with limitless loyalty to Chairman Mao, carry out self-criticism and criticism of revisionism in the Mao Zedong Thought Family Study Classes.

Chen Qingying's husband, Shang Heqing, is a cadre in the production team. In the family study class, he did not speak, and after participating in the brigade's study class for three whole days, he still did not speak. Chen Qingying noticed that her husband's expression was unusual and asked him what kind of meeting he had attended these days. He replied, "The brigade's study class is about criticizing selfishness, but I feel I have no selfishness to criticize." Did Shang Heqing really have no selfishness to criticize? Originally, Shang Heqing had a thought, carrying a burden. In 1962, the black wind of "three freedoms and one contract" blown by Liu Shaoqi reached West Old Spring. Shang Heqing, at that time, was poisoned by Liu Shaoqi's revisionist line and deceived by class enemies, doing some things that violated collective interests. In the study class, he, due to selfishness, was afraid of this and that, and did not dare to expose it.

One evening, the whole family gathered in front of Chairman Mao's portrait to study Chairman Mao's works and engage in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism. The third son, Guanghai, led the whole family in studying Chairman Mao's latest directive on "criticizing selfishness and revisionism." Chen Qingying then bluntly pointed out her husband's violation of collective interests. She said, "Chairman Mao teaches us to 'criticize selfishness and revisionism,' if you have selfishness and don't expose it, do you deserve Chairman Mao?" Guanghai followed up, "Father, if you don't clean up the selfishness and dirt on your body, carrying the 'self' character, you can't wholeheartedly follow Chairman Mao to revolutionize!" With the help of the whole family, Shang Heqing expressed his determination to go to the brigade's study class to thoroughly expose his selfishness.

The next evening after dinner, Shang Heqing had just left, and Chen Qingying followed him to the brigade's study class. She wanted to personally listen to how her husband exposed his selfishness. Unexpectedly, Shang Heqing's selfishness surfaced again at the critical moment, exposing half and leaving half. Chen Qingying, after listening, did not wait for the meeting to end and went back home angrily. Shang Heqing returned home after the meeting, and the family was studying Chairman Mao's works and engaging in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism. Chen Qingying greeted him and asked, "Have you exposed your selfishness?" Heqing said, "I have." Qingying pointed out sharply, "Father, Chairman Mao teaches us 'never forget class struggle,' you don't expose class enemies, and your own selfishness is only half-exposed, how can you revolutionize with selfishness?" Shang Heqing, blushing, said, "I was afraid of exposing too much and having no face to see people in the future." Guanghai also criticized sternly, "Father, we are poor and lower-middle peasants, we can't lie in front of Chairman Mao's portrait. Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Making mistakes is inevitable, as long as you correct them sincerely, it's fine.' Having selfishness and not exposing it is truly shameful, exposing and correcting it is not shameful. Liu Shaoqi, this big bad guy, wants to use a little benefit under his eyes to seduce us to take the capitalist road, making us poor and lower-middle peasants suffer twice and endure twice the hardships, you must not be fooled!"

Chairman Mao's teachings and the help of family members made Shang Heqing realize his mistake and stand up excitedly, saying, "I have forgotten my roots and am ungrateful to Chairman Mao. You are right, if I don't dig out my selfishness, I will fall for the bad guys and be pulled back to the old society's road by Liu Shaoqi. I must completely break with the 'self' character."

Shang Heqing in the brigade's study class mercilessly exposed the crimes of class enemies and thoroughly exposed his selfishness, receiving the welcome of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, who all said that the Mao Zedong Thought Family Study Classes are the solution to problems.

The Mao Zedong Thought Family Study Classes in the West Old Spring Production Brigade bloomed everywhere and became better and better. The spring breeze of Mao Zedong Thought blew into every family of the members, and every family underwent profound changes. The family of the fourth production team member Guo Dekuan is one of them.

When mentioning Guo Dekuan's family, the villagers clearly remember that a few years ago, because Guo Dekuan was the accountant of the production team, he went out early and returned late, and the family often had quarrels, to the point that Guo Dekuan did not want to be the accountant anymore. After the family study class was established, the first lesson was reminiscing about bitterness and sweetness. The second lesson was exposing and criticizing selfishness. That evening, Guo Dekuan led the whole family in studying Chairman Mao's latest directive on "criticizing selfishness and revisionism." His wife, Guo Fuku, followed up, saying, "In our family, only the two of us are sensible, you go to the fields to work, and I stay at home to cook for you, we don't lack food or clothing, isn't this good enough, what problems does our family have?" Guo Dekuan said, "What problems? The problems are not small. I feel that after I stopped being the accountant, I was tied down by the small family, caring more about family matters and less about the team's matters. Chairman Mao teaches us to serve the people wholeheartedly, I have let down his teachings." At this point, Guo Fuku couldn't sit still and said, "You can't just blame yourself, I was also poisoned by Liu Shaoqi's 'three freedoms and one contract,' only calculating my own small accounts, afraid of offending people by being a cadre, I forgot the past bitterness, forgot Chairman Mao's teachings, and shouldn't have pulled you back." Then, they fiercely criticized Liu Shaoqi's revisionist garbage and decided to follow Chairman Mao and resolutely take the socialist road. On the third evening, the whole family discussed in the study class how to follow Chairman Mao's teachings to seize the revolution and promote production, and implement Chairman Mao's directives with practical actions. At that time, it was the busy spring sowing season, and the production team lacked cadres to manage production. Guo Dekuan said, "Now the team needs people, we must think of a way, and can't let class enemies laugh at us." Guo Fuku thought for a moment and said, "The season doesn't wait for people, production cannot be delayed, you have been a cadre for more than ten years, you have experience in organizing production, I think you should organize the members to work tomorrow." The next morning, Guo Dekuan led the members to the fields. Once, when the team was transplanting seedlings, during the rest time, Guo Dekuan carefully checked the production quality. He found that some places had sparse and dense seedlings, and the weeds were not weeded clean, so he studied Chairman Mao's relevant teachings with everyone and organized everyone to check and criticize. All of this, Guo Fuku saw with her own eyes and remembered in her heart. In the family study class, she praised her husband and expressed that she would also think of the collective like her husband in the future. In the past, Guo Fuku rarely participated in the team's work, but now, although she has four children, she often goes to the fields to work. In the spring, she went to the fields to labor every day to plant corn, and at night, she and her husband took turns going to the fields to carry water to irrigate the land. The members praised them as a "red couple."

The Ten Benefits of Establishing Mao Zedong Thought Family Study Classes

Through the establishment of Mao Zedong Thought Study Classes, a revolution has been sparked in the homes of the West Old Spring Production Brigade. The sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought has illuminated the village, changing people, land, and mountains, and the whole village is a sea of red.

From this brigade, the establishment of Mao Zedong Thought Family Study Classes has ten benefits:

1. Everyone reads Chairman Mao's revolutionary treasure book. From white-haired old people to teenagers, from women with many children and heavy housework to illiterate old women, everyone has been organized through the family study class. Old poor peasant Shang Xuezhong is over seventy years old and illiterate, but he has a loyal heart to Chairman Mao. He asks others to read Chairman Mao's quotations to him one word at a time, and the more he studies, the more he loves to study, the more he studies, the more energetic he becomes, caring about collective production and wanting to be an "old fool."

2. Every family is a battlefield for revolutionary criticism, and everyone is a revolutionary critic. After establishing the family study class, men, women, old, and young all join in, and everyone wants to be a critic. They study one of Chairman Mao's quotations, criticize one of Liu Shaoqi's fallacies, closely combine it with the reality of class struggle, fiercely criticize a handful of class enemies; link it with their own active thoughts, and fiercely criticize selfishness. Through family criticism and individual criticism, even children know that Liu Shaoqi is a big bad guy, and children make a clay figure as Liu Shaoqi and criticize it.

3. Raised class awareness and promoted the struggle against enemies. In the past, the class enemies of the West Old Spring Brigade often used feudal clan relationships to carry out sabotage activities. Through the establishment of family study classes, they studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "never forgetting class struggle" and fiercely criticized Liu Shaoqi's theory of "class struggle extinction." The class struggle and two-line struggle awareness of the poor and lower-middle peasants has been greatly raised. Ten-year-old Shang Guanghai is very active in the struggle against enemies. Class enemies hate him to death and use clan relationships to play tricks, finding Shang Guanghai's grandmother and saying, "Our little grandson shouts 'down with me' as soon as he sees me, you don't say anything to him." Guanghai's grandmother firmly replied, "Our Guanghai is right, you have done so many bad things, you should be overthrown!" The family study class promoted the struggle against enemies in West Old Spring, and everyone competed to expose and criticize class enemies, struggling against class enemies in large meetings, small meetings, and in the fields, dragging them to the family study class to struggle, making the unrepentant landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements in the brigade stink and become rats that everyone wants to beat.

4. Heroic and model figures emerge continuously. In the West Old Spring Brigade, after this thorough proletarian cultural revolution, Mao Zedong Thought has been widely promoted, and heroic and model figures emerge in large numbers.

Poor peasant woman Shang He'e is illiterate, but she has a red heart that is loyal to Chairman Mao. To learn the "Three Constantly Read Articles," she found a cultured girl, working and sleeping together during the day and night. That girl often taught her to learn the "Three Constantly Read Articles" word by word and sentence by sentence, making the three shining images deeply imprinted in Shang He'e's mind. During the days of fighting drought and planting, she, in order to seize every minute and second to defeat the drought and complete the planting task on time, carried her own water jar to the fields. At night, she climbed over cliffs and mountains in the dark to carry water, filling the jar to the brim, and was praised as a "revolutionary old yellow cow." Not only is there a Shang He'e in the second team, but every team has a "Shang He'e." The whole brigade has evaluated twelve active learners and users of Mao Zedong Thought and seventy-five excellent learners.

5. Mao Zedong Thought nurtures a new generation. In the past, members raised children to prevent old age, but now they raise children for the revolution. In the past, they educated their children to study well, have culture, and abandon the hoe to "become an official"; now they educate their children to study Chairman Mao's works well and become new farmers with socialist awareness and culture, following Chairman Mao to revolutionize forever. The third team's poor peasant member Wang Xiubao's son, Wang Chunyuan, used to be naughty and playful. One day, little Chunyuan's mother was educating him at home. Wang Xiubao returned from the fields and saw this, threw down his hoe, and angrily said, "This child is useless, if you don't study well in the future, you will be like me, unable to avoid carrying a hoe and hiding in the cornstalks." After the family study class was established, Wang Xiubao thought about this incident, repeatedly pondering in his mind, "Is this way of educating my son correct?" Thus, he exposed this incident in the family study class and made a self-criticism using the three shining images in the "Three Constantly Read Articles." He said, "I was poisoned by Liu Shaoqi's poison, the 'self' character attacked my heart, and even educating children couldn't escape the 'I' character." Then, according to Chairman Mao's teachings, he educated little Chunyuan, and now little Chunyuan has become an active learner of Chairman Mao's works in the team.

6. Mao Zedong Thought is in charge, eliminating the remnants of patriarchy. In the past, some families in the West Old Spring Production Brigade followed the old habits of "a family of a thousand mouths, one person in charge" and "follow the father if there is a father, follow the elder brother if there is no father." After the establishment of the Mao Zedong Thought Family Study Classes, old family rules were broken, and new customs were established. No matter who in the family speaks words that conform to Mao Zedong Thought, everyone listens to them and acts according to them. Mao Zedong Thought truly took charge of the family.

Shang Xiguang's family has sixteen people. In the past, no matter what happened in the family, he was the one who decided. Since the establishment of the study class, everything has changed. The brigade leadership led the whole team to engage in the anti-drought struggle. When discussing this issue in the family study class, Shang Xiguang's twelve-year-old granddaughter Guangqin criticized him, saying, "Chairman Mao calls for 'seizing the revolution and promoting production,' grandfather doesn't let grandmother go to the fields to work, this does not conform to Mao Zedong Thought." Shang Xiguang immediately praised little Guangqin and also told his son, daughter-in-law, grandson, and granddaughter, "If my words and deeds deviate from Mao Zedong Thought, you should learn from Guangqin and rebel against me." The next day, he let his wife go to the fields with the members to fight the drought.

7. Changing customs. In June of this year, the member Shang Xilian's uncle passed away, and his four sisters heard the news and rushed over, each wanting to leave five yuan for the funeral. However, Shang Xilian firmly refused to accept it. That evening, he invited his sisters to participate in the family study class. He and his sisters together recalled his uncle's suffering in the old society and his leading role in joining the mutual aid group, cooperative, and people's commune after liberation, and his wholehearted love for the collective. Shang Xilian said earnestly, "The road Uncle took is the road we should take. We must always think of Chairman Mao's teachings and always think of socialism." The four sisters participated in this study class and received great education, all expressing that they would also establish Mao Zedong Thought Family Study Classes when they returned home.

Now, when a poor and lower-middle peasant in the West Old Spring Brigade dies, the production team holds a memorial service for the deceased, using this method to educate the masses to resolutely take the bright socialist road.

8. Farming for the revolution, production reaches a new high. The West Old Spring Production Brigade established family study classes, fiercely criticized Liu Shaoqi's revisionist fallacy of "work points in command," and promoted the spirit of farming for the revolution. In April of this year, the drought was severe, and the members, in order to plant corn, carried more than ten million loads of water, with an average of more than one hundred miles per person per day. A group of young male and female members often gathered together after the family study class ended at night and secretly went to the fields to work. When the blackboard newspaper praised them, they all erased their names, saying, "We are doing it for the revolution, not for fame and wealth."

9. The family has become a stronghold for anti-revisionism and preventing revisionism. Through the establishment of family study classes, the revolutionization of people's thoughts has been promoted, and a long city wall of proletarian "publicness" has been built. Men, women, old, and young use Mao Zedong Thought to analyze everything, criticize everything, resist the infiltration of feudalism, bourgeoisie, and revisionism, and cleanse the mud and dirt left over from the old society. The poor and lower-middle peasants say, "In the past, the family was a shelter and a haven for the bourgeois 'self' character and the 'revisionism' character, now it is the front line of criticizing selfishness, the battlefield of criticizing revisionism, and the classroom for promoting Mao Zedong Thought."

10. Blocked the capitalist evil path and resolutely took the broad and smooth socialist road. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants, with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, criticized selfishness and revisionism, drew a clear line between the proletarian and bourgeois classes, the socialist and capitalist roads, and the proletarian revolutionary and bourgeois reactionary lines, realizing that following Chairman Mao and insisting on taking the people's commune road is the golden bridge to communism. Liu Shaoqi's attempt to restore capitalism in the countryside is to push the poor and lower-middle peasants into the fire pit. The poor and lower-middle peasants in this brigade, with the proletarian "publicness" in mind, care for the collective, and the socialist roots are planted deeper and deeper, and the capitalist sprouts are uprooted as soon as they appear. They say, "Socialism is the broad and smooth road, we must follow Chairman Mao to revolutionize for life."

　　用毛泽东思想统帅一切　在家庭里爆发革命
　　——西老泉大队大办毛泽东思想家庭学习班，社员群众精神面貌大变化
    林彪副主席指示我们：“必须通过活学活用毛主席著作，把毛主席的思想灌输到工人、农民中去，才能改变劳动人民的精神面貌，才能使精神力量转化为巨大的物质力量。”山东省历城县仲宫公社西老泉大队的领导班子，在人民解放军济南部队某部毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，领导社员大办毛泽东思想家庭学习班，组织男女老少活学活用毛主席著作，全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，人们的精神面貌发生了翻天覆地的深刻变化。最近，我们怀着兴奋和激动的心情，到这个大队调查访问了社员大办毛泽东思想家庭学习班，斗私批修，促进思想革命化的情况。
    大办毛泽东思想家庭学习班让毛泽东思想占领家庭阵地
    西老泉生产大队毛泽东思想家庭学习班，是在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争中办起来的。
    今年三月，有个生产队干部，由于工作中有些缺点、错误，受到了贫下中农的批评，他自己就认为当干部吃力不讨好，提出不干了。后来生产大队领导班子对他进行了教育，使他认识了错误，他当场表示要好好为贫下中农办事；可是一回家，爱人却拖他的后腿，这个干部在思想上又受到影响。
    还有一件事：在生产大队召开的批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的大会上，民兵连长张荣福带头揪斗了一个坏分子。这个坏分子会上表面上低头认罪，可是会后，继续耍花招，跑到张荣福家里，向张荣福的父亲假惺惺地说：“咱爷们，乡里乡亲的，有些什么过不去的事，叫荣福到家讲讲就算了。”张荣福的父亲听了坏分子的话，便对儿子说：“以后你少管点闲事！”
    上述情况，给人民解放军某部毛泽东思想宣传队和生产大队的领导班子提出了这样一个尖锐的问题：为什么那个干部在生产大队思想搞通了，回到家里又变了卦？为什么那个坏分子竟然敢到民兵连长家里去捣鬼？他们带着这个问题，反复地学习了毛主席的有关教导。毛主席说：“对于农村的阵地，社会主义如果不去占领，资本主义就必然会去占领。”通过学习，他们认识到：家庭是从几千年私有制的基础上传下来的，现在虽然是社会主义社会，但是在一些社员的家庭里，剥削阶级的旧思想的流毒还很深。如果不用毛泽东思想去占领家庭这个阵地，家庭就会变成资产阶级“私”字的防空洞，避风港，就会被阶级敌人利用来钻空子。因此，对家庭这块阵地必须用毛泽东思想去占领、去改造。同时，组织社员以家庭为单位学习毛主席著作，也有利于把男女老少都组织到活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动中来，能够更好地实现毛泽东思想的大普及。这一切深刻地教育了大家：毛泽东思想家庭学习班非办不可。
    办好毛泽东思想家庭学习班全靠对毛主席的一片忠心
    毛主席说：“任何新生事物的成长都是要经过艰难曲折的。”西老泉生产大队办毛泽东思想家庭学习班，一开始就遇到了阶级敌人的破坏和旧的习惯势力的阻挠。阶级敌人对广大贫下中农举办毛泽东思想家庭学习班，怕得要死，恨得要命，到处煽阴风，点邪火，胡说什么“大忙时办这个，有空歇歇多好”。诬蔑社员积极办学习班是“想往上爬当干部”。有些社员受了旧的习惯势力的束缚，也认为“一家老小几辈，公公、媳妇、大伯哥、弟媳坐在一起亮私斗私，张不开嘴”；还有的认为“办学习班是干部的事，一家老的老，少的少，咋个办得起来？”针对这种情况，解放军某部毛泽东思想宣传队和生产大队的领导成员，反复学习了毛主席“阶级斗争，一抓就灵”的教导，认识到：广大贫下中农对毛主席是无限热爱的，只要用毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的学说武装贫下中农，把广大贫下中农的阶级斗争观念提得高高的，无产阶级感情搞得深深的，在广大贫下中农心里牢固树立一个对伟大领袖毛主席无限忠诚的“忠”字，就能排除一切障碍，把毛泽东思想家庭学习班办起来。
    事情正是这样发展的。从下面介绍的三个家庭学习班的举办到学习班在全大队普遍开花、结果，说明解放军毛泽东思想宣传队和大队领导班子的认识是正确的。
    第三生产队社员郭德元家有老母亲、爱人、弟媳和四个孩子，共八口人。刚办家庭学习班时，遇到不少阻力，经过回忆对比，提高了觉悟，排除了障碍，是全生产大队毛泽东思想家庭学习班办得比较好的一家。
    今年三月，郭德元从生产大队参加毛泽东思想学习班回来，坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召，积极举办家庭学习班。可是，郭大娘一时思想不通，说：“七老八小的，斗大的字不识一个，办啥学习班呀！”郭德元想起毛主席的教导：“阶级斗争，一抓就灵。”便要求母亲给全家拉拉苦难的家史。提起苦难的旧社会，郭大娘伤心地说：“要说过去咱穷人受的苦，三天三夜也说不完啊！就说一九四一年吧，那是个大荒年，咱家仅有的六分地，又被地主霸占了去，逼得咱一家七口四处逃荒。你那年刚满十一岁，就领着你妹妹逃生在外，我拉着你二弟，抱着你三弟，到处讨饭，家里留下你爷，病在床上，无人照管。就在这一年，你爷和你爹活活饿死，我被逼得走投无路，忍着痛把你三弟卖了。以后，咱一直穷得揭不开锅，又把你七岁的妹妹送给人家当童养媳……”，说到这里，郭大娘泣不成声，全家人都伤心得流下了眼泪。接着全家又谈了解放后的幸福生活，从斗地主分田地，到走上合作化、人民公社化的道路，一桩桩地摆，一件件地议，越摆越觉得天大地大不如党的恩情大，越议越觉得爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲。郭大娘激动地说：“有了毛主席，才有了咱们一家！”郭德元看母亲思想开了窍，就接上说：“毛主席号召咱大办学习班，咱要赶快把家庭学习班办起来。”郭大娘回答说：“毛主席他老人家说的，咱坚决照办。”
    郭德元家的学习班办起来以后，每天晚上全家围坐在毛主席像前，学习毛主席著作，进行斗私批修，全家人的精神面貌焕然一新。
    村头大核桃树下，住着第一生产队贫农社员陈庆英一家。陈庆英今年四十岁，跟前有八个孩子，大的十九岁，小的刚满两周岁。今年春上，全家十口人办起了毛泽东思想学习班，从这家学习班可以看出，西老泉大队的社员在毛泽东思想家庭学习班上，是怎样怀着对毛主席的无限忠诚，开展斗私批修的。
    陈庆英的丈夫商和庆，是生产队的一个干部，在家庭学习班里不吭声，参加大队学习班整整三天了，也一言不发。陈庆英发现老伴神色不对头，就问他这几天开的什么会。他回答说：“大队学习班叫斗私心，我觉着我没有什么私心可斗。”商和庆真没有私心可斗吗？原来商和庆有个活思想，背上了包袱。一九六二年，中国赫鲁晓夫刮起的“三自一包”的黑风吹到了西老泉。商和庆一时中了中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义路线的毒和受了阶级敌人的欺骗，做过一些违犯集体利益的事情。在学习班里，他由于私心作怪，怕这怕那，一直没敢亮出来。
    一天晚上，全家围坐在毛主席像前学习毛主席著作，斗私批修。三儿子广海首先领着全家学习了毛主席“要斗私，批修”的最新指示。接着陈庆英就开门见山，把老伴违犯集体利益的事全盘端了出来。她说：“毛主席教导咱‘要斗私，批修’，你有私心不亮，对得起毛主席吗？”广海又接上说：“爹，你身上的私心、脏气，如果不打扫干净，带着‘私’字就不能真心实意跟毛主席他老人家干革命！”在全家帮助下，商和庆表示决心，要到大队学习班里去彻底亮自己的私心。
    第二天晚饭后，商和庆前脚刚走，陈庆英后脚就跟到了大队学习班屋外，她要亲自听一听老伴怎么亮私心。没想到商和庆临阵私心又抬头，亮了一半，留了一半。陈庆英听了，没等会开完，就气呼呼地回去了。商和庆开完会回到家里，家里的人正在学习毛主席著作，斗私批修会开得正热乎。陈庆英迎上去劈头就问：“你的私心亮了吗？”和庆说：“亮啦。”庆英一针见血地指出：“广海爹，毛主席教导咱‘千万不要忘记阶级斗争’，你对阶级敌人不揭发，自己的私心又亮了个半截子，带着私心干革命怎么能行？”商和庆红着脸说：“我是怕亮多了，以后没脸见人。”广海也严肃批评：“爹，咱是贫下中农，在毛主席像前不能说假话。毛主席教导咱：‘犯错误是难免的，只要认真改了，就好了。’你有私心不亮才真丑，亮了改了就不丑了。中国赫鲁晓夫这个大坏蛋，就想用眼皮底下的一点小利，引诱我们走资本主义道路，叫咱贫下中农受二遍苦，遭二茬罪，你千万不要上当！”
    毛主席的教导，亲人的帮助，使商和庆觉悟过来了，站起来激动地说：“我忘了本，对不起毛主席他老人家。你们说的对，如果不把私心挖出来，就会上坏人的当，被中国赫鲁晓夫拉到旧社会的老路上去。我一定要和‘私’字一刀两断。”
    商和庆在大队学习班里无情地揭发了阶级敌人的罪行，彻底地亮出了自己的私心，受到了广大贫下中农的欢迎，都说毛泽东思想家庭学习班就是解决问题。
    西老泉生产大队毛泽东思想家庭学习班遍地开花，越办越好。毛泽东思想的春风吹进了每个社员的家庭，家家都发生了深刻的变化。第四生产队社员郭德宽家就是其中的一个。
    提起郭德宽家，村里的人都清楚地记得，前几年，因为郭德宽当生产队会计，早出晚归，家里的事顾不上，夫妻之间经常闹别扭，直闹得郭德宽会计也不当了。家庭学习班办起来以后，头一课是忆苦思甜。第二课是亮私斗私。这天晚上，郭德宽领着全家学习了毛主席“要斗私，批修”的最新指示。他爱人郭福芹接上说：“咱家懂事的就是咱们俩，你上地干活，我在家里给你做饭，不缺吃，不愁穿，这不是很好嘛，咱家有啥问题！”郭德宽说：“有啥问题？问题还不小哩。我觉着我不当会计以后，就被小家庭拴住了，关心家庭的事多了，考虑队里的事少了。毛主席教导我们要全心全意为人民服务，我辜负了他老人家的教导。”话说到这里，郭福芹坐不住了，说：“那不能光怨你，也怪我中了中国赫鲁晓夫‘三自一包’的流毒，光打个人的小算盘，又怕你当干部得罪人，我忘了过去的苦，忘了毛主席的教导，不该扯你的后腿。”接着，他们狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义黑货，决心跟着毛主席，坚决走社会主义道路。第三天晚上，全家在学习班里，认真讨论了怎样按照毛主席的教导，抓革命，促生产，以实际行动落实毛主席的指示。当时，正是春播大忙季节，生产队缺少干部抓生产。郭德宽说：“现在队里正需要人，我们得想个法子，不能让阶级敌人看笑话。”郭福芹想了想，说：“季节不等人，生产不能耽误，你当了十几年的干部，组织生产有经验，我看明日你先把社员组织起来干活吧。”第二天一大早，郭德宽就带领社员上了坡。一次队里间谷苗，休息的时候，郭德宽认真检查了生产质量，他发现有的地方谷苗稀的稀、密的密，草还没锄净，就和大家一块学习毛主席的有关教导，并组织大家对照检查。这一切，郭福芹看在眼里，记在心里，在家庭学习班上，对丈夫进行了表扬，并表示以后要象丈夫那样一心想着集体。过去，郭福芹对队里的活很少沾边，现在，她虽然有四个孩子，却经常上坡干活。春上抗旱播种玉米，她天天上坡劳动，晚上还和丈夫轮流上坡挑水浇地，社员们夸他们是夫妻“一对红”。
    办毛泽东思想家庭学习班的十大好处
    西老泉生产大队通过大办毛泽东思想学习班，在家庭里爆发了革命。毛泽东思想的阳光照亮了山村，人变、地变、山河变，全村一片红彤彤。
    从这个大队看，大办毛泽东思想家庭学习班有十大好处：
    一，人人读毛主席的革命宝书。从白发苍苍的老人，到十几岁的娃娃，从子女多、家务重的妇女，到不识字的老太太，都通过家庭学习班的形式组织起来了。老贫农商学忠七十多岁，不识字，但他对毛主席一片忠心，叫别人一字一句地读毛主席语录给他听，他越学越爱学，越学越有劲，关心集体生产，一心要做“老愚公”。
    二，家家是革命大批判的战场，人人都是革命大批判的战士。办起家庭学习班后，男女老少齐上阵，个个争当批判家。他们学习毛主席一条语录，批判中国赫鲁晓夫一个谬论，紧密结合阶级斗争实际，狠斗一小撮阶级敌人；联系自己的活思想，狠挖私心。通过家家批，人人批，几岁的娃娃也都知道中国赫鲁晓夫是个大坏蛋，孩子们做成个泥人，当作中国赫鲁晓夫，围起来批斗。
    三，提高了阶级觉悟，推动了对敌斗争。过去，西老泉大队的阶级敌人，常常利用封建宗族关系进行破坏活动。通过举办家庭学习班，大学毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论，贫下中农的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟大大提高。十岁的商广海对敌斗争很积极，阶级敌人恨得要命，利用宗族关系大耍诡计，找到商广海的奶奶说：“咱的小孙子一见面就喊打倒我，你也不说说他。”广海的奶奶坚定地回答：“俺广海做的对，你干尽了坏事，就该打倒你！”家庭学习班推动了西老泉的对敌斗争，大家争着揭发、批判阶级敌人，对阶级敌人大会斗，小会斗，地头斗，拉到家庭学习班里斗，把本队没有改造好的地、富、反、坏分子斗得臭臭的，成了过街老鼠，人人喊打。
    四，英雄模范人物不断涌现。在西老泉大队，经过这场天翻地覆的无产阶级文化大革命，毛泽东思想空前大普及，英雄模范层出不穷。
    贫农女社员商和娥是个文盲，但她有颗无限忠于毛主席的红心。为了学会“老三篇”，她找了一个有文化的姑娘，白天劳动在一起，晚上睡觉在一起。那个姑娘经常一字字、一句句地教她学“老三篇”，使三个光辉形象深深印在了商和娥的脑子里。在抗旱抢种的日子里，她为了争分夺秒战胜干旱，按时完成播种任务，把自己的水缸抬到地头，晚上摸着黑爬崖过岭担水，把缸灌得满满的，被誉为“革命的老黄牛”。不但二队有个商和娥，队队都有“商和娥”。全大队共评出活学活用毛泽东思想标兵十二名，五好学员七十五名。
    五，毛泽东思想哺育了新一代。社员们从前养儿育女为防老，现在养儿育女为革命。从前教育子女好好读书，有了文化，丢掉锄头去“当官”；现在教育子女，好好学习毛主席著作，做个有社会主义觉悟的有文化的新农民，跟着毛主席永远干革命。三队贫农社员王秀宝的孩子王春元，原来爱调皮贪玩。一天，小春元的妈妈正在家里教育他，王秀宝下地干活回家碰上此事，就把锄头一扔，生气地说：“这孩子就是没出息，你今后再不好好上学，将来和我一样，误不了拿着锄头钻高粱棵。”办起家庭学习班后，王秀宝想起此事，脑子里反复地琢磨着，“这样教育儿子对头吗？”于是，他在家庭学习班上把这件事亮了出来，用“老三篇”里三个光辉形象对照作了检查。他说：“我中了中国赫鲁晓夫的流毒，‘私’字攻了心，教育孩子也离不开‘我’字。”接着又按照毛主席的教导，对小春元进行了一番教育，现在小春元成了队里学习毛主席著作的积极分子。
    六，毛泽东思想当家，破除了家长制残余。西老泉生产大队过去有些家庭沿袭着“家有千口，主事一人”“有父从父，无父从兄”的旧习惯。举办毛泽东思想家庭学习班以后，破了旧家规，立了新风尚。一家人不论男女、长幼，谁说的话符合毛泽东思想就听谁的，就照谁的做，毛泽东思想真正当了家。
    商希贵家有十六口人。过去一家三代不论什么事情都是他说了算。他家自从办起了学习班，就大不一样了。生产大队领导全队投入抗旱斗争。在家庭学习班上讨论这个问题时，商希贵十二岁的孙女广琴批评他说：“毛主席号召‘抓革命，促生产’，爷爷不让奶奶上坡干活，这不符合毛泽东思想。”商希贵立即表扬了小广琴，他还对儿子、儿媳和孙子、孙女说：“我的一言一行要是离开毛泽东思想，你们就跟广琴学，造我的反。”第二天，他便让老伴上坡和社员们一起抗旱。
    七，移风易俗。今年六月，社员商希连的叔父病故，他的四个姐姐闻讯赶来，每人都要留下五块钱作丧礼，但商希连坚决不收。当天晚上，他请姐姐们参加家庭学习班。他和姐姐们共同回忆了叔父在旧社会受的苦和解放后叔父带头加入互助组、合作社、人民公社，一心热爱集体的事迹。商希连语重心长地说：“叔叔走的路，正是咱应该走的路。咱们一定要时刻想着毛主席的教导，时刻想着社会主义。”四个姐姐参加了这次学习班，受到很大的教育，都表示，回到家里，也要把毛泽东思想家庭学习班办起来。
    现在，西老泉大队那一家贫下中农死了人，生产队就为死者开追悼会，用这个方法，教育群众坚决走社会主义光明大路。
    八，为革命种田，生产掀高潮。西老泉生产大队办起家庭学习班，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫“工分挂帅”的修正主义谬论，为革命种田的精神大发扬。今年四月，干旱严重，社员们为了抢种玉米，担了十万多担水，平均每人每天担水走一百多里。有一群男女青年社员，常常在晚上家庭学习班结束后凑到一块，偷偷下地干活。黑板报上表扬他们时，他们都把自己的名字擦掉，说：“我们是为革命，不是为名利。”
    九，家庭变成了反修防修的阵地。通过举办家庭学习班，促进了人的思想革命化，筑起了无产阶级“公”字的长城。男女老小用毛泽东思想分析一切，批判一切，抵制封、资、修的侵袭，荡涤旧社会遗留下来的污泥浊水。贫下中农们说：“过去家庭是资产阶级‘私’字的防空洞，‘修’字的避风港，现在是斗私的前线，批修的战场，普及毛泽东思想的课堂。”
    十，堵死了资本主义的邪路，坚决走社会主义的康庄大道。广大贫下中农以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，斗私批修，划清了无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级、社会主义道路和资本主义道路两条道路、无产阶级革命路线和资产阶级反动路线两条路线的界限，认识到紧跟毛主席坚持走人民公社的道路，是通向共产主义的金桥，中国赫鲁晓夫企图在农村复辟资本主义，就是要把贫下中农推进火坑。这个大队的贫下中农，无产阶级的“公”字当头，心怀集体，社会主义的根子越扎越牢，资本主义的毒芽一露头就被连根拔掉。他们说：“社会主义是康庄大道，我们一定紧跟毛主席干一辈子革命。”
