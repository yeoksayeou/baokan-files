The revolutionary committees continue to consolidate and develop, and the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought has entered a new phase. The revolutionary and production situation in the entire county is getting better and better.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 19th: With the help of the PLA's leftist cadres, the Revolutionary Committee of Huizhou County, Guangdong Province, has promoted the revolutionary good learning style advocated by Chairman Mao, thoroughly criticized the bourgeois bad learning style of separating theory from practice, followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and fully implemented Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. This has enabled the broad revolutionary masses of the entire county to closely unite around the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, with Chairman Mao as the head and Vice Chairman Lin as the deputy, to achieve unity of thought, unity of action, and unity of action. They have criticized the reactionary bourgeois "multi-center theory," making the revolutionary and production situation in the entire county better and better.

	Raising Awareness of the Learning Style Issue, Establishing a Revolutionary Good Learning Style in the Struggle

The Revolutionary Committee of Huizhou County, established in January this year, took studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought as the fundamental task of all work and promoting the revolutionary good learning style advocated by Chairman Mao as an important measure to lead the broad revolutionary masses of the entire county to deeply carry out the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and to turn the entire county into a red Mao Zedong Thought school. The Mao Zedong Thought study classes held by various levels of revolutionary committees all took promoting the revolutionary good learning style as the first lesson of the study class. Therefore, the revolutionary good learning style of combining theory with practice advocated by Chairman Mao has been widely promoted among the revolutionary masses of the entire county, and the awareness of implementing Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions has been significantly improved.

However, when the Revolutionary Committee of Huizhou County led the masses to establish a revolutionary good learning style and implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, they initially faced a sharp and complex class struggle. The broad revolutionary masses firmly implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions. A handful of class enemies, however, fiercely attacked and slandered the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Within our revolutionary ranks, there were also some people who had been influenced by a very bad learning style. They studied Chairman Mao's works and latest instructions to defend the "private" character in their minds and to serve the interests of small groups. They spoke beautifully but acted differently. The PLA leftist cadres believed that this was a struggle between two learning styles: one of studying and using, and the other of studying but not using. It was also a serious class struggle over whether to be for "public" or "private," a fundamental issue of loyalty to Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Therefore, the leftist cadres suggested convening a full meeting of the Revolutionary Committee to decide to vigorously promote and seriously study the communiqu√© of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, study Chairman Mao's great leader's remarks on the learning style issue, and study Vice Chairman Lin's instructions on studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought: "Study with problems in mind, study actively and apply, combine study with use, study first what is urgently needed, see immediate results, and work hard on the 'use' aspect." Everyone deeply realized that the revolutionary good learning style advocated by Chairman Mao is fundamentally about combining theory with practice. Vice Chairman Lin's principles and methods for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought are a brilliant embodiment of combining theory with practice. Loyalty to Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line means studying and applying in unity, combining theory with practice. For Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the battle commands from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, with Chairman Mao as the head and Vice Chairman Lin as the deputy, we must study them diligently, understand them deeply, and implement them resolutely. We must implement what we understand and also implement what we do not yet understand, deepening our understanding in the process of implementation. Everyone expressed their determination to inherit and carry forward the revolutionary good learning style advocated by Chairman Mao, to study and apply, and to strive to become successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause who are forever loyal to Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must grasp the class struggle in the ideological field." With the help of the PLA leftist cadres, the Revolutionary Committee of Huizhou County has always firmly grasped the learning style issue in the process of fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, ensuring that Chairman Mao's latest instructions are fully implemented through learning, applying, and establishing a revolutionary good learning style in the struggle. They used the method of "one study, two expose, three calculate, four criticize, five establish" to thoroughly criticize the bourgeois bad learning style and establish Chairman Mao's revolutionary good learning style. Study means studying Chairman Mao's teachings on "the learning style issue is a matter of the thought method of leading organs, all cadres, and all Party members, a matter of our attitude towards Marxism-Leninism, and a matter of the work attitude of all Party comrades" and his brilliant works such as "Reform Our Study." Expose means exposing the various manifestations of the rotten bourgeois bad learning style. Calculate means accounting for the harm of the bourgeois bad learning style. Criticize means criticizing the rotten learning style advocated by the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, such as the Chinese Khrushchev. On this basis, we established Chairman Mao's revolutionary good learning style of combining theory with practice. Through study, exposure, calculation, criticism, and establishment, the broad revolutionary masses quickly raised their understanding of the learning style issue to the height of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, to the height of loyalty to Chairman Mao. They took studying, implementing, propagating, and defending Chairman Mao's latest instructions as their sacred duty. The entire county quickly launched a high tide of establishing and running Mao Zedong Thought study classes, which effectively promoted the widespread dissemination of Mao Zedong Thought in the entire county, ensured the full implementation of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, and ensured that revolutionary committees or leading groups were established in all counties, communes, and brigades by mid-March.

	Insisting on the Revolutionary Good Learning Style, Working Hard on the "Use" Aspect

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Regarding Marxist theory, one must be able to master it and apply it. The purpose of mastery is entirely for application." The PLA cadres stationed in Huizhou County followed Chairman Mao's teachings, helping the Revolutionary Committee to focus on the "use" aspect in the process of establishing a revolutionary good learning style, accurately, swiftly, and unconditionally implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

In implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "The revolutionary committee should implement unified leadership, break down overlapping administrative organs, streamline and downsize, and organize a revolutionary leadership team that is connected with the masses," the Revolutionary Committee initially faced a struggle over whether to use or not to use. This was due to the lingering influence of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line pushed by the Chinese Khrushchev in power-building, as well as the obstruction of the "private" character in people's minds and the interference of the bourgeois reactionary learning style. In this struggle, the PLA leftist cadres actively advocated for use, guided use, praised use, and firmly opposed the bourgeois bad learning style of studying but not using, ensuring the full implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The County Revolutionary Committee, through studying and applying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, implemented streamlining and downsizing, reducing the leadership team of the County Revolutionary Committee from over five hundred people in the old organization to ninety-plus people. After the experience of streamlining and downsizing in Lushan County, Henan, was published, they convened an expanded meeting of the County Revolutionary Committee with the help of the leftist cadres, further studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the construction of revolutionary committees, and conducting a strict, thorough, and comprehensive streamlining and downsizing again. The number of staff was reduced from the original ninety to thirty. The number of staff in the commune revolutionary committees was also universally reduced by fifty to sixty percent, leaving only three to four people in the office to handle daily affairs, with the rest all going deep into the grassroots for point work. The broad revolutionary masses praised the newly born revolutionary committees for establishing a revolutionary good learning style of studying and applying in unity. They said: "The revolutionary good learning style has brought about a good style of leadership, setting a good example for us to study and apply in unity."

At the same time, the leftist cadres and various levels of revolutionary committees also paid great attention to summarizing the advanced experience of the masses in studying and applying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, using methods such as organized visits, mobile lectures, and experience sharing to commend advanced units and individuals, making the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the entire county continuously reach new heights, studying and applying at new levels, and continuously consolidating and developing various levels of revolutionary committees in the process of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

	Continuously Promoting the Revolutionary Good Learning Style, Following Chairman Mao's Great Strategic Deployment

With the help of the PLA leftist cadres, the Revolutionary Committee of Huizhou County deeply realized through struggle practice that at the moment of seizing the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution, it is especially necessary to be infinitely loyal to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, with Chairman Mao as the head and Vice Chairman Lin as the deputy. The more we need to promote the revolutionary good learning style, the more we need to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment step by step. Over the past half year, the Revolutionary Committee of Huizhou County has followed every battle command from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, with Chairman Mao as the head and Vice Chairman Lin as the deputy, and implemented it swiftly and resolutely, ensuring that the good learning style of combining theory with practice is widely promoted.

In March this year, the Provincial Revolutionary Committee decided to carry out activities of big study, big propaganda, big summary, big comparison, and big inspection in the entire province to further implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions on inspecting North China, Central South, and East China, and convened a telephone conference for mobilization. When the telephone conference ended, it was already past ten o'clock in the evening, and some grassroots units in Huizhou County had already rested. Some members of the County Revolutionary Committee planned to convey and implement the spirit of the telephone conference the next day. The military representatives participating in the revolutionary three-in-one combination and the leftist PLA cadres believed that this slow and sluggish style was a reflection of the bourgeois bad learning style. They immediately proposed to quickly convey the spirit of the telephone conference to every organ, factory, mine, commune, and brigade. At the same time, they also organized the telephone conference records, printed them overnight, and the next morning, dispatched cadres to quickly deliver them to the communes, factories, enterprises, and institutions. The entire county immediately launched a new high tide of establishing and running Mao Zedong Thought study classes and studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, promoting the further implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

When Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a political revolution under the conditions of socialism, in which the proletariat opposes the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, and is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and its leadership and the broad revolutionary masses and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie" were issued, the Revolutionary Committee of Huizhou County immediately convened a meeting of leaders of various levels of revolutionary committees, established study classes, and further deepened the struggle against the enemy. The members of various levels of revolutionary committees studied and applied, deeply entering the brigades or production teams where class struggle was relatively complex to establish frontline study classes, further deepening the struggle against the enemy, achieving one victory after another, and ensuring that Chairman Mao's latest instructions were better implemented. This consolidated the great achievements of the Cultural Revolution organizationally, and further eliminated the influence of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line pushed by the Chinese Khrushchev in the political, ideological, and theoretical aspects, consolidating and developing the newly born revolutionary committees.

The broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary people, with a heart full of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, grasped the "use" aspect of the great Mao Zedong Thought, achieving unity of study and application, unity of words and deeds, and combining theory with practice. The entire county has emerged a large number of advanced units and individuals in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought has entered a new phase.
