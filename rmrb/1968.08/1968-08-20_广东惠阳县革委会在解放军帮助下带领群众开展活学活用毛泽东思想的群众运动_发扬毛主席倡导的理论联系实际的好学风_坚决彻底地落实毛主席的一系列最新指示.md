The Revolutionary Committee of Huizhou County, Guangdong, with the help of the PLA, leads the masses in carrying out the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. They promote the good learning style advocated by Chairman Mao of combining theory with practice and resolutely and thoroughly implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions.

The revolutionary committees continue to consolidate and develop, and the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought has entered a new phase. The revolutionary and production situation in the entire county is getting better and better.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 19th: With the help of the PLA's leftist cadres, the Revolutionary Committee of Huizhou County, Guangdong Province, has promoted the revolutionary good learning style advocated by Chairman Mao, thoroughly criticized the bourgeois bad learning style of separating theory from practice, followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and fully implemented Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. This has enabled the broad revolutionary masses of the entire county to closely unite around the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, with Chairman Mao as the head and Vice Chairman Lin as the deputy, to achieve unity of thought, unity of action, and unity of action. They have criticized the reactionary bourgeois "multi-center theory," making the revolutionary and production situation in the entire county better and better.

	Raising Awareness of the Learning Style Issue, Establishing a Revolutionary Good Learning Style in the Struggle

The Revolutionary Committee of Huizhou County, established in January this year, took studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought as the fundamental task of all work and promoting the revolutionary good learning style advocated by Chairman Mao as an important measure to lead the broad revolutionary masses of the entire county to deeply carry out the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and to turn the entire county into a red Mao Zedong Thought school. The Mao Zedong Thought study classes held by various levels of revolutionary committees all took promoting the revolutionary good learning style as the first lesson of the study class. Therefore, the revolutionary good learning style of combining theory with practice advocated by Chairman Mao has been widely promoted among the revolutionary masses of the entire county, and the awareness of implementing Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions has been significantly improved.

However, when the Revolutionary Committee of Huizhou County led the masses to establish a revolutionary good learning style and implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, they initially faced a sharp and complex class struggle. The broad revolutionary masses firmly implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions. A handful of class enemies, however, fiercely attacked and slandered the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Within our revolutionary ranks, there were also some people who had been influenced by a very bad learning style. They studied Chairman Mao's works and latest instructions to defend the "private" character in their minds and to serve the interests of small groups. They spoke beautifully but acted differently. The PLA leftist cadres believed that this was a struggle between two learning styles: one of studying and using, and the other of studying but not using. It was also a serious class struggle over whether to be for "public" or "private," a fundamental issue of loyalty to Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Therefore, the leftist cadres suggested convening a full meeting of the Revolutionary Committee to decide to vigorously promote and seriously study the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, study Chairman Mao's great leader's remarks on the learning style issue, and study Vice Chairman Lin's instructions on studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought: "Study with problems in mind, study actively and apply, combine study with use, study first what is urgently needed, see immediate results, and work hard on the 'use' aspect." Everyone deeply realized that the revolutionary good learning style advocated by Chairman Mao is fundamentally about combining theory with practice. Vice Chairman Lin's principles and methods for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought are a brilliant embodiment of combining theory with practice. Loyalty to Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line means studying and applying in unity, combining theory with practice. For Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the battle commands from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, with Chairman Mao as the head and Vice Chairman Lin as the deputy, we must study them diligently, understand them deeply, and implement them resolutely. We must implement what we understand and also implement what we do not yet understand, deepening our understanding in the process of implementation. Everyone expressed their determination to inherit and carry forward the revolutionary good learning style advocated by Chairman Mao, to study and apply, and to strive to become successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause who are forever loyal to Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must grasp the class struggle in the ideological field." With the help of the PLA leftist cadres, the Revolutionary Committee of Huizhou County has always firmly grasped the learning style issue in the process of fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, ensuring that Chairman Mao's latest instructions are fully implemented through learning, applying, and establishing a revolutionary good learning style in the struggle. They used the method of "one study, two expose, three calculate, four criticize, five establish" to thoroughly criticize the bourgeois bad learning style and establish Chairman Mao's revolutionary good learning style. Study means studying Chairman Mao's teachings on "the learning style issue is a matter of the thought method of leading organs, all cadres, and all Party members, a matter of our attitude towards Marxism-Leninism, and a matter of the work attitude of all Party comrades" and his brilliant works such as "Reform Our Study." Expose means exposing the various manifestations of the rotten bourgeois bad learning style. Calculate means accounting for the harm of the bourgeois bad learning style. Criticize means criticizing the rotten learning style advocated by the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, such as the Chinese Khrushchev. On this basis, we established Chairman Mao's revolutionary good learning style of combining theory with practice. Through study, exposure, calculation, criticism, and establishment, the broad revolutionary masses quickly raised their understanding of the learning style issue to the height of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, to the height of loyalty to Chairman Mao. They took studying, implementing, propagating, and defending Chairman Mao's latest instructions as their sacred duty. The entire county quickly launched a high tide of establishing and running Mao Zedong Thought study classes, which effectively promoted the widespread dissemination of Mao Zedong Thought in the entire county, ensured the full implementation of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, and ensured that revolutionary committees or leading groups were established in all counties, communes, and brigades by mid-March.

	Insisting on the Revolutionary Good Learning Style, Working Hard on the "Use" Aspect

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Regarding Marxist theory, one must be able to master it and apply it. The purpose of mastery is entirely for application." The PLA cadres stationed in Huizhou County followed Chairman Mao's teachings, helping the Revolutionary Committee to focus on the "use" aspect in the process of establishing a revolutionary good learning style, accurately, swiftly, and unconditionally implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

In implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "The revolutionary committee should implement unified leadership, break down overlapping administrative organs, streamline and downsize, and organize a revolutionary leadership team that is connected with the masses," the Revolutionary Committee initially faced a struggle over whether to use or not to use. This was due to the lingering influence of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line pushed by the Chinese Khrushchev in power-building, as well as the obstruction of the "private" character in people's minds and the interference of the bourgeois reactionary learning style. In this struggle, the PLA leftist cadres actively advocated for use, guided use, praised use, and firmly opposed the bourgeois bad learning style of studying but not using, ensuring the full implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The County Revolutionary Committee, through studying and applying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, implemented streamlining and downsizing, reducing the leadership team of the County Revolutionary Committee from over five hundred people in the old organization to ninety-plus people. After the experience of streamlining and downsizing in Lushan County, Henan, was published, they convened an expanded meeting of the County Revolutionary Committee with the help of the leftist cadres, further studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the construction of revolutionary committees, and conducting a strict, thorough, and comprehensive streamlining and downsizing again. The number of staff was reduced from the original ninety to thirty. The number of staff in the commune revolutionary committees was also universally reduced by fifty to sixty percent, leaving only three to four people in the office to handle daily affairs, with the rest all going deep into the grassroots for point work. The broad revolutionary masses praised the newly born revolutionary committees for establishing a revolutionary good learning style of studying and applying in unity. They said: "The revolutionary good learning style has brought about a good style of leadership, setting a good example for us to study and apply in unity."

At the same time, the leftist cadres and various levels of revolutionary committees also paid great attention to summarizing the advanced experience of the masses in studying and applying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, using methods such as organized visits, mobile lectures, and experience sharing to commend advanced units and individuals, making the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the entire county continuously reach new heights, studying and applying at new levels, and continuously consolidating and developing various levels of revolutionary committees in the process of implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

	Continuously Promoting the Revolutionary Good Learning Style, Following Chairman Mao's Great Strategic Deployment

With the help of the PLA leftist cadres, the Revolutionary Committee of Huizhou County deeply realized through struggle practice that at the moment of seizing the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution, it is especially necessary to be infinitely loyal to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, with Chairman Mao as the head and Vice Chairman Lin as the deputy. The more we need to promote the revolutionary good learning style, the more we need to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment step by step. Over the past half year, the Revolutionary Committee of Huizhou County has followed every battle command from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, with Chairman Mao as the head and Vice Chairman Lin as the deputy, and implemented it swiftly and resolutely, ensuring that the good learning style of combining theory with practice is widely promoted.

In March this year, the Provincial Revolutionary Committee decided to carry out activities of big study, big propaganda, big summary, big comparison, and big inspection in the entire province to further implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions on inspecting North China, Central South, and East China, and convened a telephone conference for mobilization. When the telephone conference ended, it was already past ten o'clock in the evening, and some grassroots units in Huizhou County had already rested. Some members of the County Revolutionary Committee planned to convey and implement the spirit of the telephone conference the next day. The military representatives participating in the revolutionary three-in-one combination and the leftist PLA cadres believed that this slow and sluggish style was a reflection of the bourgeois bad learning style. They immediately proposed to quickly convey the spirit of the telephone conference to every organ, factory, mine, commune, and brigade. At the same time, they also organized the telephone conference records, printed them overnight, and the next morning, dispatched cadres to quickly deliver them to the communes, factories, enterprises, and institutions. The entire county immediately launched a new high tide of establishing and running Mao Zedong Thought study classes and studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, promoting the further implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

When Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a political revolution under the conditions of socialism, in which the proletariat opposes the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, and is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and its leadership and the broad revolutionary masses and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie" were issued, the Revolutionary Committee of Huizhou County immediately convened a meeting of leaders of various levels of revolutionary committees, established study classes, and further deepened the struggle against the enemy. The members of various levels of revolutionary committees studied and applied, deeply entering the brigades or production teams where class struggle was relatively complex to establish frontline study classes, further deepening the struggle against the enemy, achieving one victory after another, and ensuring that Chairman Mao's latest instructions were better implemented. This consolidated the great achievements of the Cultural Revolution organizationally, and further eliminated the influence of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line pushed by the Chinese Khrushchev in the political, ideological, and theoretical aspects, consolidating and developing the newly born revolutionary committees.

The broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary people, with a heart full of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, grasped the "use" aspect of the great Mao Zedong Thought, achieving unity of study and application, unity of words and deeds, and combining theory with practice. The entire county has emerged a large number of advanced units and individuals in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought has entered a new phase.

    革命委员会不断巩固和发展，活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动出现新局面，全县的革命和生产形势越来越好
    据新华社广州十九日电　广东省惠阳县革命委员会在解放军支左人员帮助下，发扬毛主席亲自倡导的理论联系实际的革命好学风，彻底批判理论脱离实际的资产阶级坏学风，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，使全县广大革命群众紧紧团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的周围，统一认识、统一步伐、统一行动，批判反动的资产阶级的“多中心论”，使全县革命、生产形势越来越好。
      提高对学风问题的认识，在斗争
          中不断树立革命好学风
    惠阳县革命委员会在今年一月刚成立，就把活学活用毛泽东思想作为一切工作的根本，把发扬毛主席亲自倡导的革命好学风，作为带领全县广大革命群众深入开展活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动，把全县办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校的重要措施。各级革命委员会举办的毛泽东思想学习班，都把发扬革命好学风作为办好学习班的第一课。因而，毛主席亲自倡导的理论联系实际的革命好学风在全县革命群众中大发扬，落实毛主席一系列最新指示的自觉性大提高。
    但是，惠阳县革命委员会在带领广大群众树立革命好学风，落实毛主席一系列最新指示时，一开始就面临着一场尖锐复杂的阶级斗争。广大革命群众对毛主席的最新指示坚决照办，认真落实。一小撮阶级敌人却拚命攻击、污蔑活学活用毛主席最新指示的群众运动。在我们革命队伍内部也有一些人，沾染了一种极坏的学风，他们学习毛主席著作、毛主席的最新指示，是为自己头脑里的资产阶级“私”字辩护，为小团体的利益服务，口头上说得漂亮，行动上另是一样。解放军支左人员认为，这是一场学了就用，还是学了不用的两种学风的斗争，同时又是一场严肃的为“公”还是为“私”的阶级斗争，是对待毛主席、毛泽东思想、毛主席革命路线忠不忠的根本立场问题。于是，支左人员就建议召开革委会全体会议，决定在全县范围内大力宣传和认真学习党的八届十一中全会公报，学习伟大领袖毛主席关于学风问题的论述，学习林副主席关于活学活用毛泽东思想“要带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影，在‘用’字上狠下功夫”的指示。大家深刻认识到，毛主席亲自倡导的革命好学风，最根本的就是理论联系实际，林副主席关于活学活用毛泽东思想的方针、原则和方法，就是理论联系实际的光辉体现。忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的革命路线，就要学用一致，就要理论联系实际。对毛主席的最新指示，对以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的战斗号令，都要刻苦学习，深刻领会，认真执行，坚决照办，做到理解的坚决执行，暂时不理解的也坚决执行，在执行过程中加深理解。大家纷纷表示，一定要继承和发扬毛主席亲自倡导的革命好学风，学了就用，努力把自己锻炼成为永远忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席革命路线的无产阶级革命事业接班人。
    毛主席教导我们：“要抓意识形态领域里的阶级斗争。”惠阳县革委会在解放军支左人员的帮助下，在全面落实毛主席最新指示的过程中，始终坚定不移地狠抓学风问题，做到在斗争中学，在斗争中用，在斗争中树立革命好学风，保证毛主席的最新指示全面落实。他们运用“一学、二揭、三算、四批、五立”的方法，大破资产阶级的反动的腐朽学风，大立毛主席的革命好学风。学，就是学习毛主席关于“学风问题是领导机关、全体干部、全体党员的思想方法问题，是我们对待马克思列宁主义的态度问题，是全党同志的工作态度问题”的教导和《改造我们的学习》等光辉著作，联系思想，联系实际，对照检查。揭，就是揭露腐朽的资产阶级坏学风的种种表现。算，就是清算资产阶级坏学风的危害。批，就是批判中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派所鼓吹的资产阶级的腐朽学风。在此基础上，大立毛主席亲自倡导的理论联系实际的革命好学风。经过学、揭、算、批、立，广大革命群众把对学风问题的认识迅速提高到阶级斗争、两条路线斗争的高度，提到忠不忠于毛主席的大节的高度，把学习、执行、宣传、捍卫毛主席的最新指示作为自己的神圣职责。全县迅速掀起大办、办好毛泽东思想学习班的高潮，有力地促进了全县毛泽东思想的大普及，保证了毛主席一系列最新指示的全面落实，使全县在三月中旬从县、社各单位到大队都建立革命委员会、革命小组或领导班子。
        坚持革命好学风，
        在“用”字上狠下功夫
    毛主席教导我们：“对于马克思主义的理论，要能够精通它、应用它，精通的目的全在于应用。”人民解放军驻惠阳县支左人员遵循毛主席的教导，帮助革命委员会在树立革命好学风的过程中，狠抓一个“用”字，准确、迅速、不折不扣地落实毛主席的最新指示。
    县革委会在贯彻执行毛主席关于“革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子”的最新指示中，由于中国赫鲁晓夫在政权建设上推行的反革命修正主义路线的流毒没有肃清，加上人们头脑里“私”字的阻挠和资产阶级反动学风的干扰，经历了一场用还是不用的斗争。在这场斗争中，解放军支左人员积极提倡用，引导用，表扬用，坚决反对学了不用的资产阶级的坏学风，使毛主席的最新指示全面落实。县革委会经过活学活用毛主席最新指示，实行精兵简政，使县革委会的领导班子由旧机构的五百多人精简到九十多人。当河南灵宝县精兵简政的经验发表后，他们又在支左人员帮助下，召开县革委会常委扩大会议，进一步反复学习毛主席关于革命委员会建设的最新指示，再一次进行严格的、彻底的、全面的精兵简政，办事人员又由原有的九十人减到三十人。各公社革委会办事人员也普遍减少了百分之五十到六十，除留在机关处理日常事务的三到四人外，其余全部深入基层蹲点。广大革命群众称赞新生的革命委员会树立了学用一致的革命好学风。他们说：“革命的好学风，带来了领导班子的好作风，为我们树立了学了就用、学用结合的好榜样。”
    与此同时，支左人员和各级革委会还十分重视总结群众活学活用毛主席最新指示的先进经验，运用组织参观、巡回讲用、经验介绍等方法，表扬先进单位和个人，使全县活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动不断出现高潮，学出新水平，用出新水平，各级革命委员会在落实毛主席最新指示的过程中不断得到巩固和发展。
          不断发扬革命好学风，
      紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署
    惠阳县革委会在解放军支左人员的帮助下，从斗争实践中深刻认识到，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的时刻，特别需要对以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的无限忠诚，越是要发扬革命好学风，步步紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。半年多来，惠阳县革委会对毛主席一系列最新指示，对来自以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部每一项战斗号令，都是闻风而动，雷厉风行地贯彻执行，做到宣传毛主席的最新指示不过夜，贯彻毛主席的最新指示分秒必争，执行毛主席的最新指示坚定不移，使理论联系实际的好学风得到大发扬。
    今年三月，广东省革委会为了进一步落实毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区的最新指示，决定在全省范围内开展大学习、大宣传、大总结、大评比、大检查的活动，并召开电话会议进行动员。电话会议结束时，已是晚上十时多，惠阳县有些基层单位已经休息了。县革委会有的委员准备在第二天再进行传达、贯彻。参加革命三结合的军队代表和支左解放军认为，这种慢慢吞吞的作风，是资产阶级坏学风的一种反映。立即提出要把电话会议精神迅速传达到每一个机关、厂矿，以及每一个公社、大队中去。同时还将电话会议记录整理出来，连夜打印，第二天一早，派出干部迅速送给各公社、厂矿、企业、事业单位。全县立即掀起一个大办毛泽东思想学习班、大学毛主席最新指示的新高潮，推动了毛主席最新指示进一步落实。
    毛主席关于“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续”的最新指示一发表，惠阳县革命委员会立即召开各级革命委员会负责人会议，大办学习班，进一步深入开展对敌斗争。各级革委会成员学了就用，纷纷深入到阶级斗争比较复杂的大队或生产队去大办火线学习班，进一步深入开展对敌斗争，取得了一个又一个胜利，使毛主席的最新指示得到更好的落实，从组织上巩固了无产阶级文化大革命的伟大成果，并且进一步从政治上、思想上和理论上清除中国赫鲁晓夫推行的反革命修正主义路线的流毒，巩固和发展了新生的革命委员会。
    广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，对伟大领袖毛主席胸怀一个“忠”字，对伟大的毛泽东思想狠抓一个“用”字，做到学用一致、言行一致，理论联系实际，全县涌现出一大批活学活用毛泽东思想的先进单位和个人，活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动出现了新的局面。
