Albania's "Unity" newspaper published an editorial on August 11 denouncing the Soviet revisionist traitors for acting as faithful henchmen of U.S. imperialism, intensifying their collusion with Asian reactionaries, and suppressing the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggles of the Asian people.

The article states that under the banner of strengthening the Soviet-American alliance, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, on the one hand, is closely cooperating with U.S. imperialists in all fields, and on the other hand, is vigorously strengthening its ties and exchanges with reactionary forces in various countries. After establishing diplomatic relations with the reactionary clique in "Malaysia," Soviet revisionists have quickly moved to establish relations with other reactionary groups in Asia. Recently, the Soviet revisionist group sent a "tourist group" to the Philippines to engage in activities. At the same time, the reactionary government in Manila issued a visa to the head of the Soviet revisionist news agency in Singapore to visit the Philippines. It is reported that this visit is being conducted with the aim of establishing diplomatic relations between the Soviet revisionists and the Philippines. It should be noted that the Soviet revisionists took this step precisely when the reactionary government of the Philippines turned the Philippines into a base for U.S. imperialist aggression against Vietnam and sent more and more cannon fodder to Vietnam.

The article points out that the Soviet revisionists' establishment of diplomatic relations with some reactionary groups in Asia is precisely to demonstrate their eagerness to strengthen ties with Asian reactionary groups and, as faithful allies and henchmen of U.S. imperialism, to do everything possible to extinguish the revolutionary flames that have already been ignited in Asia. These facts convincingly show that both U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism are attempting, through collusion with Asian reactionaries, to implement their common counter-revolutionary global strategy and strengthen the "encirclement" of the great socialist power, the People's Republic of China, which is holding high the banner of revolution and anti-imperialist struggle.

The article points out that no matter what sinister plots the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists hatch to implement their strategy of world domination, their counter-revolutionary goals will never succeed.

　　阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》谴责苏修美帝在亚洲的反革命阴谋
　　美苏勾结反动派加紧拼凑反华包围圈
    据新华社地拉那十一日电　阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》十一日发表评论员文章，谴责苏修叛徒充当美帝忠实帮凶，加紧勾结亚洲反动派，镇压亚洲人民的反帝革命斗争的罪行。
    文章说，苏修叛徒集团在加强苏美联盟的宗旨下，一方面同美帝国主义者加紧在一切领域的合作，一方面竭力加强同各国反动派的联系和往来。苏联修正主义者在同“马来西亚”反动集团建立外交关系以后，又接二连三地同亚洲其它反动集团加速搭上关系。最近，苏修集团派遣了一个“观光团”到菲律宾活动。与此同时，马尼拉反动政府还发给苏修通讯社在新加坡的头子以访问菲律宾的签证。据报道，这次访问是在为建立苏修同菲律宾之间的外交关系的宗旨下进行的。应该指出，苏联修正主义者正是在菲律宾反动政府把菲律宾变成美帝国主义者侵略越南的基地并向越南派遣越来越多的炮灰的时候，跨出这一步的。
    文章指出，苏修同亚洲一些反动集团建立外交关系，正是为了表明他们十分热心于加强同亚洲反动集团的联系，并作为美帝忠实的盟友和帮凶，千方百计地企图扑灭已在亚洲燃起的革命斗争烈火。这些事实还令人信服地表明，美帝和苏修都企图通过勾结亚洲的反动派，以推行他们共同的反革命全球战略，加强对高举革命和反帝斗争旗帜的伟大的社会主义强国中华人民共和国的“火力包围圈”。
    文章指出，但是，不管美帝国主义者和苏联赫鲁晓夫修正主义者为推行他们主宰世界的反革命战略策划什么样的险恶阴谋，他们的反革命目的是永远也不会得逞的。
