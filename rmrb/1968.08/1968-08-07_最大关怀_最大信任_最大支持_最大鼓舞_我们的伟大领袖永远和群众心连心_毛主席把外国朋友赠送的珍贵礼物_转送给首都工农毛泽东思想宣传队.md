Maximum concern, maximum trust, maximum support, maximum inspiration. Our great leader is forever united with the masses in heart. Chairman Mao has transferred the precious gifts given by foreign friends to the Capital Workers and Peasants Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team.

On the joyous occasion of the second anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's "Bombard the Headquarters" big-character poster and the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," the great leader Chairman Mao personally gave mangoes. This great piece of news spread, and the masses' cheers of "Long live Chairman Mao!" echoed through the sky.

The broad revolutionary masses expressed their unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, and they will unite more closely around the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. They will unify their will, steps, and actions, firmly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, resolutely criticize the reactionary "multi-center theory," timely expose and smash the plots of a handful of class enemies who attempt to sabotage Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Xinhua News Agency, August 6th: Our great teacher and great leader Chairman Mao, on August 5th, transferred the precious gifts given by foreign friends to Chairman Mao—mangoes—to the Capital Workers and Peasants Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team.

This great piece of news spread, and the cheers of "Long live Chairman Mao!" echoed through Tsinghua Garden. The revolutionary warriors participating in the Capital Workers and Peasants Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team excitedly said, "The great leader Chairman Mao has always been united with us in heart. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, be unconditionally loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, closely unite around the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, under the command of the proletarian headquarters, unify our will, steps, and actions, firmly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, resolutely criticize the reactionary 'multi-center theory,' timely expose and smash the plots of a handful of class enemies who attempt to sabotage Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

On the joyous occasion of the second anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's "Bombard the Headquarters" big-character poster and the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," the great leader Chairman Mao personally gave mangoes. This is not only the greatest concern, trust, and support for the Capital Workers and Peasants Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, but also the greatest inspiration, concern, education, and encouragement for the working class and the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers across the country who are united and fighting under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin!

The Capital Workers and Peasants Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team is a new type of revolutionary and combat-ready team organized according to Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, with the working class as the main body. Since they came to Tsinghua University, they have, with deep proletarian feelings of being unconditionally loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, unconditionally loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and unconditionally loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, fought side by side with the revolutionary Red Guards and revolutionary faculty and staff of Tsinghua University. They have enthusiastically propagated and resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, achieving great success. Their revolutionary actions have prominently demonstrated the leading role of the working class and the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the proletarian education revolution.

On the afternoon of the 5th, when the great news of Chairman Mao giving mangoes to the Capital Workers and Peasants Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team reached Tsinghua Garden, people immediately gathered around the precious gifts given by the great leader Chairman Mao, cheering enthusiastically and singing joyfully. They were tearful, repeatedly and sincerely wishing our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao a long, long life! Long, long life! Long, long life! They called their respective units to spread this great piece of news and held various celebratory activities throughout the night, braving the rain to report the joy to Zhongnanhai and express their loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao.

The revolutionary warriors of the Capital Workers and Peasants Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team excitedly said, "The great leader Chairman Mao has given us gifts, also given us the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and given us the powerful spiritual atomic bomb. Chairman Mao supports us, and we must make Chairman Mao proud! We must not disappoint the great leader Chairman Mao's earnest expectations and, together with the broad revolutionary faculty and staff, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, fully implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, and turn the university into a red Mao Zedong Thought university! We must better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, accelerate the revolutionization of our thoughts, and forge the Capital Workers and Peasants Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team into a vanguard that follows Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and implements Chairman Mao's latest instructions. We must forge it into a strong, revolutionary, and combat-ready proletarian propaganda team and make greater contributions to achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" They expressed: We must carry out in-depth, detailed, patient, and persistent propaganda work, truly turning Mao Zedong Thought into the actual actions of the broad revolutionary masses. The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Knitting Factory solemnly declared that they must achieve: holding a flag in hand—the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought; having a guideline in mind—the guideline of class struggle; and having a line in heart—Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line! Four old workers from the Beijing New China Printing Factory composed and performed artistic programs overnight. They sang: Dear teacher Chairman Mao, we are forever loyal to you! Forever following you to make revolution, our hearts will never change even if the sea dries up and the stones decay!

The revolutionary Red Guards and revolutionary faculty and staff of Tsinghua University were immersed in unprecedented happiness. Many Red Guards excitedly said: Chairman Mao giving mangoes to the Capital Workers and Peasants Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team is also the greatest inspiration, education, and encouragement for us! Chairman Mao loves me, I love Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao supports me, I support Chairman Mao. We must resolutely support the revolutionary actions of the Capital Workers and Peasants Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, closely unite under the wise leadership of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, quickly and fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, unite to fight the enemy, direct the struggle at China's Khrushchev, at a handful of spies, traitors, and unrepentant capitalist roaders, carry out the struggle-criticism-transformation well in our school, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Tsinghua University to the end!
