The spring breeze of Mao Zedong Thought is sweeping across the land of our motherland. Under the decisive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the call of our great leader Chairman Mao to "grasp revolution and promote production," the poor and lower-middle peasants and the broad masses of our commune members have been full of enthusiasm and striving to be the best. This year, we have again achieved a bumper harvest of fruits and vegetables.

Now, as far as the eye can see, the commune is filled with fresh fruits and vegetables. The commune members are all full of energy, busy harvesting and transporting. Every day, from morning to night, carts loaded with fruits and vegetables are rushed to the city to supply the workers, cadres, teachers, students, and the broad masses of residents in the capital. Every time we see the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the capital getting better and better, see the fruits and vegetables we supply from the suburbs filling the shelves of the capital's stores and markets, and see the prosperous scene in the entire city, we commune members are always full of joy, truly indescribably happy.

The better the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, the better the life of the Chinese people, the more the Soviet revisionist clique fears and worries. The recent article published in the Soviet revisionist *Pravda* actually absurdly claims that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has disrupted production and "seriously worsened the material conditions of the Chinese working people." This is truly outrageous!

Our commune is just one of the tens of thousands of communes in China. But even the facts from our commune alone can completely refute the shameless lies spread by the Soviet revisionist clique.

In 1966, the first year of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the total production of commercial vegetables in our commune was 227,411,100 jin. In 1967, it reached 238,157,700 jin, an increase of 4.7% over 1966. This year, we are on track to achieve an even greater harvest. Take, for example, a production brigade in our commune that specializes in fresh fruits. Their planting area is only 100 mu. In 1965, they produced 45,000 jin of fresh fruits. In 1966, this increased to over 80,000 jin, and in 1967, it further increased to over 100,000 jin.

The continuous improvement in our commune's production is not due to favorable weather or geographical advantages, but because of the impetus of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the power of Mao Zedong Thought.

In 1967, we launched a vigorous revolutionary criticism campaign, fiercely criticizing the revisionist goods such as "material incentives," "work points as the key," "three freedoms and one contract," and "four freedoms" that the Chinese Khrushchev promoted in the countryside. The class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres has been greatly heightened. The entire commune launched a mass movement to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought has illuminated the hearts of us poor and lower-middle peasants. Through self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, we have established a new communist ethos of having a heart for the country, eyes on the world, wholeheartedly for the state, wholeheartedly for the collective, selflessly, and dedicated to farming for the revolution.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: material can turn into spirit, and spirit can turn into material. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a powerful spiritual force has turned into a great material force, which is why our commune's vegetables and fruits have had bumper harvests year after year. The Soviet *Pravda* can fabricate and slander as it pleases, but your lies can never suppress the facts of the bumper harvest or erase the prosperous scene in the capital's markets!

We Chinese farmers know very well what kind of people the Soviet revisionist clique are. You hang the sign of "socialism" but sell capitalist goods. You reverse course, engage in restoration, and have turned the red land of Soviet socialism into a mess, making the Soviet economy a shambles and causing the broad masses of Soviet workers to suffer twice.

We are farmers who produce vegetables and fruits, so let's take a look at the vegetable supply and people's lives in the Soviet Union today. On July 4 of this year, your *Moscow Pravda* published under the title "Price Reduction" the state prices of some vegetables and fruits: cucumbers 60 kopecks per kilogram (1 ruble = 100 kopecks, equivalent to 1.30 yuan), apricots 1 ruble 20 kopecks per kilogram. The prices in the free market are even higher: cucumbers 1 ruble per kilogram, apricots 2 rubles 50 kopecks, three tomatoes 50 kopecks, potatoes 2 rubles per kilogram. Such expensive vegetables and fruits, apart from a small handful of the bourgeois privileged class, how can the broad masses of workers afford them and be fully satisfied?

But what about the prices of our vegetables and fruits? Let's compare them with the retail prices in Beijing on the same day, July 4. Cucumbers are 6 to 11 fen per kilogram, tomatoes 6 to 10 fen per kilogram, potatoes 10 to 15 fen per kilogram, peaches 20 to 40 fen per kilogram. We don't have a free market here at all. State-run stores sell dozens of kinds of vegetables and fruits every day at unified prices, fully meeting the needs of the broad masses of people.

The Soviet revisionists might argue: the prices in Beijing and Moscow are different, how can they be compared? But the prices and the income of the working people can be compared, right! Here, the broad masses of working people can eat fresh, affordable, and high-quality vegetables and fruits all year round. There, even the most ordinary vegetables and fruits have become luxuries for workers and peasants. This stark contrast only shows that we are on different paths from the Soviet revisionist clique. We are a socialist state under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and both industry and agriculture serve the interests of the broad masses of people. Our workers and peasants are united, and the people of the entire country are united as one, striving under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao to build a socialist motherland. You are a revisionist state under the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, and all politics, economy, and culture serve a small privileged class. You few people only care about eating and taking more for yourselves, not caring about the suffering of the people. You are the ones who truly "seriously worsen the material conditions of the broad masses of working people."

Our great leader Chairman Mao personally presided over the formulation of the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," which points out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a powerful driving force for the development of social productive forces in our country." The double harvest of "grasp revolution and promote production" in our Siqing People's Commune fully proves this. The situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution across the country is excellent, and industry and agriculture are thriving and prosperous, which is a further proof of this. The slander of the Soviet revisionists is nothing but biting their own tongues!

    苏修叛徒自打嘴巴
    北京四季青人民公社　樊修农
    毛泽东思想的春风，吹遍了祖国的大地。在无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的大好形势下，在伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的号召下，咱们公社的贫下中农和广大社员，鼓足干劲，力争上游，今年又夺得了瓜果蔬菜的大丰收。
    现在，一眼望去，社里鲜果满园，蔬菜遍地。社员们个个劲头十足，正在忙着抢收抢运。每天从早到晚，一车车的瓜果蔬菜赶往城里，供应首都工人兄弟、机关干部、学校师生和广大居民。每当看到首都文化大革命的形势越来越好，看到咱们郊区农民供应的蔬菜鲜果堆满了首都商店菜市的货架，看到全城市场的一片繁荣景象，咱们社员的心里总是乐滋滋的，真有说不尽的高兴。
    中国文化大革命的形势越好，中国人民的日子过得越美，苏修叛徒集团就越害怕，越发愁。苏修《真理报》最近发表的一篇文章，竟然胡说什么中国的文化大革命破坏生产，“使中国劳动人民……的物质状况严重恶化”。这真是睁眼瞎说，你说气人不气人！
    我们公社，不过是中国成千上万个公社中的一个。但光是我们公社的事实，就完全可以驳倒苏修叛徒集团散布的无耻谎言。
    一九六六年，无产阶级文化大革命开始的一年，咱们社里商品蔬菜的总产量是二亿二千七百四十一万一千斤。一九六七年，达到二亿三千八百一十五万七千斤，比一九六六年增长了百分之四点七。今年，眼看又将获得更大的丰收。举一个具体的例子说，我们社里有一个专营鲜果的生产小队，种植面积不过一百亩。一九六五年，他们生产鲜果四万五千多斤，一九六六年，增加到八万多斤，一九六七年又提高到十万多斤。
    我们公社的生产节节提高，根本的原因不是天时地利，而是因为无产阶级文化大革命的推动，是毛泽东思想的威力。
    一九六七年，我们开展了轰轰烈烈的革命大批判，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫在农村所推行的“物质刺激”、“工分挂帅”、“三自一包”、“四大自由”等修正主义黑货，广大贫下中农和革命干部的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟大大提高。全公社掀起了活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，战无不胜的毛泽东思想照亮了咱们贫下中农的心。经过斗私批修，我们树立了胸怀祖国，放眼世界，一心为国家，一心为集体，毫不利己，专门利人，为革命种田的共产主义新风尚。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：物质可以变成精神，精神可以变成物质。在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，强大的精神力量变成了巨大的物质力量，所以才使我们公社的蔬菜和水果连年获得丰收。苏修《真理报》尽管可以随心所欲地造谣诬蔑，但是你们的谣言无论如何压不倒丰收的事实，抹不掉首都市场的繁荣景象！
    苏修叛徒集团是些什么家伙，我们中国农民心里是一清二楚的。你们挂的是“社会主义”招牌，卖的是资本主义货色。你们开倒车，搞复辟，把苏联社会主义的红色江山弄得一团漆黑，把苏联的经济搞得一塌糊涂，使苏联广大劳动人民又吃二遍苦。
    咱们是生产蔬菜水果的农民，那就来看看苏联今天的蔬菜供应和人民生活吧。今年七月四日，你们的《莫斯科真理报》以“降价”为题公布了部分蔬菜和水果的国营牌价：黄瓜每公斤六十戈比（一卢布为一百戈比，折合人民币一元三角），杏子每公斤一卢布二十戈比。自由市场的价格就更贵了，黄瓜每公斤一卢布，杏子每公斤二卢布五十戈比，三个西红柿要五十戈比，土豆每公斤两卢布。这样昂贵的蔬菜和水果，除了一小撮资产阶级特权阶层以外，广大劳动人民怎么能够经常买得起，得到充分满足呢？
    可是我们的蔬菜水果的价格又是怎么样呢？就拿今年七月四日同一天北京市场上的零售牌价来作对比吧：黄瓜每公斤人民币六分至一角一分，西红柿每公斤六分至一角，土豆每公斤一角至一角五分，桃子每公斤二角至四角。咱们这儿根本没有自由市场，国营商店每天都有几十种蔬菜水果按照统一的牌价出售，充分满足广大人民的需要。
    苏修叛徒们也许会辩解说：北京和莫斯科的物价不同，怎么能够相比呢？可是，物价和劳动人民的收入总是可以比较的吧！在我们这儿，广大劳动人民一年四季都能吃到供应充足、价廉物美的新鲜蔬菜和水果，而在你们那儿，就连最普通的蔬菜和水果也成了工人农民的奢侈品。这种鲜明的对比，只能说明我们同苏修叛徒集团走的不是一条道。我们是无产阶级专政的社会主义国家，工农业生产都是为广大人民的利益服务的。咱们工人农民一条心，全国人民拧成一股绳，在伟大领袖毛主席领导下为建设社会主义祖国而努力。你们是资产阶级专政的修正主义国家，一切政治、经济、文化都是为一小撮特权阶层服务的。你们一小撮人只顾自己多吃多占，那管人民受苦受难。你们才真正是使广大劳动人民的“物质状况严重恶化”。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的《中国共产党中央委员会关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》中指出：“无产阶级文化大革命是使我国社会生产力发展的一个强大的推动力。”我们四季青人民公社“抓革命，促生产”的双丰收，充分证明了这一点。全国无产阶级文化大革命形势大好，工农业生产蒸蒸日上，欣欣向荣，更是充分证明了这一点。苏修叛徒的诬蔑，只不过是自打嘴巴罢了！
