The Indian reactionary government's frenzied anti-China actions will meet a bad end. China's chargé d'affaires in India strongly protests the Indian government's new crime of creating "two Chinas."

New Delhi, August 19 (Xinhua) — The Indian reactionary government's actions of creating "two Chinas" have become increasingly rampant, openly and blatantly colluding with the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. This fully exposes the Indian reactionary government as acting according to the dictates of U.S. imperialism, as an anti-China running dog.

The tool of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, the United Nations, is currently holding a so-called "Asian Science and Technology Application Conference" in the Indian capital, New Delhi. The Indian reactionary government has allowed the Chiang Kai-shek bandits to send representatives to participate in this conference, sitting together with the representatives of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique and others to hold a meeting.

On August 9, Indian Minister of State for Education Bhagwat Jha Azad, when discussing the issue of Chiang bandit elements participating in this conference in parliament, openly used the reactionary phrases of U.S. imperialism, referring to the People's Republic of China as "Communist China," while referring to the enemy of the Chinese people, the Chiang bandits, as the "Republic of China." This is another blatant crime of the Indian reactionary government in creating "two Chinas."

On August 17, China's chargé d'affaires in India, Chen Zhaoyuan, strongly protested to the Indian Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding this incident, pointing out that the Indian government deliberately violated its repeated assurances to the Chinese government: to recognize only the People's Republic of China and to oppose the creation of "two Chinas." Chen Zhaoyuan also pointed out that the U.S. imperialists are currently stepping up the creation of "two Chinas," and the Indian government is also stepping up its anti-China actions in various ways.

The Indian reactionary government's evil deeds are not accidental. In September last year, Indian Vice Premier Desai, while in the United States, openly referred to the sacred territory of Taiwan, which is under the control of the Chiang bandits, as an "independent country." After this, the Indian reactionary government allowed 500 anti-China clowns to go to Taiwan to participate in the Chiang bandits' fake "national day" celebrations. At the same time, a gathering to celebrate the Chiang bandits' fake "national day" was openly held in the Indian capital, with members of the Indian Parliament and diplomats attending this reactionary gathering.

Since the beginning of this year, the Indian reactionary government has allowed the Chiang bandits to send representatives to India to participate in international conferences several times. In January, the Chiang bandits sent "representatives" to participate in an Asian yellow union conference held in New Delhi, and this Chiang bandit element was also invited to participate in the Indian national day celebrations. In March, Chiang bandit elements participated in the "United Nations Conference on Trade and Development" held in New Delhi. A small group of reactionary members of the Indian Parliament, who formed an anti-China committee called the "Committee Against China's Entry into the United Nations," also openly invited the Chiang bandit elements participating in this conference to attend its founding meeting. The Chiang bandit elements at the meeting shouted that they were "willing to cooperate with India."

The Indian reactionary government's actions have made the Chiang bandit elements arrogant. Recently, Taiwan's Chiang bandit newspapers have openly boasted that the Chiang bandits and the Indian reactionary government are on "the same front line," and that the two have "unconsciously become allies fighting side by side."

The Indian reactionary government has previously tried to pretend that it is "non-aligned" and does not want to get close to some of the U.S. imperialists' running dogs in Asia. The Indian reactionary government's domestic lackeys—the Indian revisionists—have also tried to propagate that the Indian reactionary government is not a running dog of the U.S. imperialists, and that its relationship with the U.S. is not a master-servant relationship but a so-called "cooperative relationship." However, the Indian reactionary government recently, following the orders of its American master, has become increasingly open in its collusion with the notorious Chiang Kai-shek bandits, revealing that they are of the same kind. The Indian reactionaries have fully exposed their true selves as slaves and running dogs of U.S. imperialism.

    印度反动政府疯狂反华绝无好下场
    我驻印临时代办强烈抗议印度政府制造“两个中国”的新罪行
    新华社十九日讯　新德里消息：印度反动政府制造“两个中国”的反华行径越来越猖獗，公然露骨地同蒋介石匪帮进行勾结。这充分暴露出印度反动政府是按照美帝国主义的意旨行事的反华走狗。
    美帝苏修的工具联合国目前正在印度首都新德里召开所谓“亚洲科学技术应用会议”。印度反动政府竟让蒋介石匪帮派人参加这次会议，同苏修叛徒集团等的代表坐在一起开会。
    八月九日，印度教育国务部长巴格瓦特·杰哈·阿扎德在议会谈到蒋匪帮分子参加这次会议的问题时，公然使用美帝国主义惯用的反动词句，把中华人民共和国称为“共产党中国”，而把中国人民的公敌蒋匪帮称作什么“中华民国”。这是印度反动政府明目张胆制造“两个中国”的又一个新的罪行。
    十七日，中国驻印度大使馆临时代办陈肇源就这一事件，向印度外交部提出了强烈抗议，指出印度政府故意违反它一再向中国政府作出的保证：只承认中华人民共和国，反对搞“两个中国”。陈肇源还指出，现在美帝国主义加紧制造“两个中国”，印度政府也在各方面加紧反华。
    印度反动政府的这种罪恶行径绝非偶然。去年九月间，印度反动政府副总理德赛在美国发表谈话，公然把蒋匪帮盘踞下的中国的神圣领土台湾说成是一个“独立国”。这以后，印度反动政府第一次允许五百名反华小丑到台湾去参加蒋匪帮的伪“国庆”。同时，在印度首都公然举行了蒋匪帮伪“国庆”的集会，印度国会议员和外交界人士出席了这个反动集会。
    今年以来，印度反动政府已经几次允许蒋匪帮派人到印度参加国际会议。一月，蒋匪帮派“代表”参加了在新德里举行的一次亚洲黄色工会会议，这个蒋匪帮分子还被邀请参加印度国庆的庆祝仪式。三月，蒋匪帮分子参加了在新德里举行的“联合国贸易和发展会议”，印度一小撮反动议员成立的一个所谓“反对中国进入联合国委员会”的反华团体，还公然邀请参加这个会议的蒋匪帮分子出席了它的成立会。蒋匪帮分子在会上叫嚷说，“很愿意同印度谋求合作”。
    印度反动政府的这些行径使蒋匪帮分子得意忘形。台湾蒋匪帮报纸最近曾露骨地叫嚷，蒋匪帮和印度反动政府是在“同一条战线上”，双方“无形中已成为并肩作战的盟友”。
    印度反动政府过去极力装模作样地表示，它是“不结盟”的，是不愿同美帝国主义在亚洲的一些走狗接近的。印度反动政府在国内的帮凶——印度修正主义分子，也极力宣传印度反动政府不是美帝走狗，它同美帝的关系不是主仆关系而是什么“合作关系”。但是，印度反动政府最近遵照美国主子的意旨，同臭名昭著的蒋介石匪帮越来越公开地勾结，表明它们只不过是一路货色。印度反动派充分暴露了它自己作为美帝的奴才和走狗的原形。
