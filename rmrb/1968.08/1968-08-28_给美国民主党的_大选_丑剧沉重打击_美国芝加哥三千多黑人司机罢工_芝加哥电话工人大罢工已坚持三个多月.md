	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 26th, Washington: The black public bus drivers in Chicago, Illinois, began a strike on the 25th, dealing another blow to the Democratic Party, a tool of American monopolistic capitalists, as they prepared to stage their "election" farce in the city's national convention.

	More than half of the 6,000 public bus drivers in Chicago are black. They have long suffered from the brutal exploitation and oppression of the monopolistic capitalists and have also been subjected to various forms of discrimination by the yellow union leaders. To protest this situation, the black bus drivers in Chicago broke through the obstruction of the yellow unions and went on strike on the 25th.

	Before the black public bus drivers went on strike, the telephone workers in Chicago had been on a large-scale strike since May 8th, which had lasted for more than three and a half months. On August 16th, the taxi drivers in Chicago also went on a large-scale strike, causing more than 80% of the taxis in the city to stop operating.

	These two strikes not only severely hit the rule of the monopolistic capitalists but also dealt a serious blow to the Democratic Party's upcoming national convention in Chicago, which is intended to stage the presidential election farce.

	Now, with the black public bus drivers in Chicago also on strike, American bourgeois news agencies are alarmed, saying this will "add difficulties" to the Democratic Party's national convention.

	The reactionary ruling clique in the United States, fearing that large-scale black anti-violence struggles and other people's struggles might erupt in Chicago during the Democratic Party's national convention, not only set up layers of barbed wire around the convention venue and mobilized 5,000 "National Guards" from Illinois to act as bodyguards but also, on the 25th, dispatched 7,500 fully armed soldiers, trained in "riot control," from domestic military bases, ready to move at any time to suppress the American people.

	However, the evil plot of the American reactionaries to suppress the American people has been met with resolute resistance from the black soldiers in the U.S. military. On the night of the 23rd, 60 black soldiers at Fort Hood in Texas refused to accept the order to be sent to Chicago to prepare to suppress the black anti-violence struggles and held an all-night demonstration in protest.

    给美国民主党的“大选”丑剧沉重打击
    美国芝加哥三千多黑人司机罢工
    芝加哥电话工人大罢工已坚持三个多月
    据新华社二十六日讯　华盛顿消息：美国伊利诺斯州芝加哥市的黑人公共汽车司机二十五日开始罢工，使美国垄断资产阶级的工具执政党民主党为上演“大选”丑剧而要在这个城市举行的全国代表大会，又受到一次新的打击。
    芝加哥市的六千余名公共汽车司机中，一半以上是黑人，他们不仅长期遭受垄断资产阶级的残酷剥削和压迫，而且还受到黄色工会头头的种种歧视。为了抗议这种情况，芝加哥市的黑人司机二十五日冲破黄色工会的阻挠举行罢工。
    在黑人公共汽车司机罢工之前，芝加哥市的电话工人从五月八日开始的大罢工已经坚持了三个半月以上。八月十六日芝加哥市的出租汽车司机又举行了大罢工，使全市百分之八十以上的出租汽车停驶。
    这两起罢工不仅严重地打击了垄断资产阶级的统治，而且对民主党为上演总统竞选丑剧而即将在芝加哥召开的全国代表大会，也是一个严重的打击。
    现在芝加哥市的黑人公共汽车司机又举行了罢工，美国资产阶级通讯社惊呼，这将给民主党全国代表大会“增加困难”。
    美国反动统治集团因为害怕在民主党全国代表大会开会期间芝加哥市可能爆发大规模的黑人抗暴斗争以及其他的人民斗争，不仅在代表大会的会场周围设置了层层铁丝网，动员了伊利诺斯州的五千名“国民警卫队”来作保镖，而且在二十五日还从国内军事基地调来了七千五百名全副武装的、经过“防暴”训练的陆军，准备随时出动镇压美国人民。
    但是美国反动派镇压美国人民的罪恶阴谋，受到了美国军队中黑人士兵的坚决抵抗。二十三日晚，得克萨斯州胡德堡的六十名黑人士兵拒绝接受派他们到芝加哥准备镇压黑人抗暴斗争的命令，并为此举行了通宵的示威。
