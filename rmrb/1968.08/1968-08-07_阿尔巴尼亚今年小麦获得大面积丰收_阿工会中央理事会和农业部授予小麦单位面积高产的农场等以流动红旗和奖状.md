Albania has achieved a large-scale harvest of wheat this year. The Central Council of the Albanian Trade Unions and the Ministry of Agriculture have awarded the units with high wheat yield per unit area with a red flag and certificates.

	NEW DELHI, August 3 — Many state farms and agricultural cooperatives in Albania have achieved a large-scale harvest of wheat this year, setting the highest production records in the history of these regions.

	The Mat district in central Albania has achieved an average yield of 31.5 hundredweight of wheat per hectare on one-third of the wheat sowing area; on the entire wheat sowing area, the average yield is 20 hundredweight per hectare, which is 5 hundredweight per hectare more than the planned target for 1970. This district has completed 71 percent more of the state's 1968 wheat production plan. In the Durres district, 28.7 percent of the wheat sowing area has achieved an average yield of 30.7 hundredweight per hectare; the average yield on the entire wheat sowing area is 19.6 hundredweight per hectare, exceeding the original state plan by 3.8 hundredweight; the entire district has completed 24 percent more of the state's 1968 wheat production plan. The Kruja district has achieved an average yield of 19.3 hundredweight per hectare on more than 6,000 hectares of wheat sowing this year, exceeding the original plan by 5.1 hundredweight per hectare; the total production is more than 10,000 hundredweight than the planned production for 1970.

	In particular, many state farms and agricultural cooperatives have made outstanding achievements in striving for a large-scale harvest this year. The state farm "November 8" in Sukth has achieved an average yield of 27 hundredweight per hectare on 1,400 hectares of wheat sowing. The agricultural cooperative "Soshaj-Bulgajeti" has achieved an average yield of 38 hundredweight per hectare on 50 percent of the wheat fields, setting a record of 29.2 hundredweight per hectare for the entire cooperative's wheat fields. The agricultural cooperative "Bat-Frankshi" has achieved an average yield of 30 hundredweight per hectare on 71 percent of the wheat fields.

	In addition, many newly established mountain agricultural cooperatives have also achieved a wheat harvest this year.

	In recent days, the party organizations and government agencies in the Mat, Durres, and Kruja districts have sent letters to their beloved leader, the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labor, Comrade Enver Hoxha, and the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Comrade Mehmet Shehu, reporting the good news of the wheat harvest and expressing their determination to continue to highlight proletarian politics, carry forward the revolutionary spirit, and push grain production forward.

	NEW DELHI, August 2 — The Central Council of the Albanian Trade Unions and the Ministry of Agriculture issued a communiqué on August 2, awarding the districts, state farms, and cooperatives with high wheat yield per unit area with socialist competition red flags and certificates.

	The communiqué pointed out that the broad masses of workers in state farms and members of agricultural cooperatives in Albania, in order to implement the resolutions of the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labor and the tasks set by the Fourth Plenum of the Party, have actively participated in the great leap forward that has swept the country, highlighted politics, and fought against difficulties caused by nature. They have done tremendous work in increasing the wheat yield per unit area and have achieved good results.

	The communiqué said that so far, many state farms and agricultural cooperatives have completed and overfulfilled the task of achieving 30 hundredweight per hectare on one-third of the wheat sowing area. In particular, many state farms and agricultural cooperatives in the Mat, Durres, and Kruja districts have achieved the best results. The Central Council of the Albanian Trade Unions and the Ministry of Agriculture decided to award the three districts and 12 agricultural units, including the state farm "November 8" in Sukth and the agricultural cooperative "Soshaj-Bulgajeti," with socialist competition red flags; and to award 21 agricultural units, including the state farm "Goshe" and the agricultural cooperative "Jube," with certificates.

	The communiqué called on all workers in state farms and members of agricultural cooperatives to work even harder, fully mobilize, complete the task of achieving 40 hundredweight per hectare on one-fourth of the corn sowing area, and produce more grain for the state.

	According to a report by the Albanian News Agency, the land irrigation area of agricultural cooperatives and state farms in Albania this year will increase by 100,000 hectares compared to 1960.

	The Albanian People's Government attaches great importance to the construction of water conservancy and irrigation projects and every year new projects are put into production. At present, the land irrigation area in the country accounts for about half of the total cultivated land. Some fertile plains, such as Ferri, Lushnje, Kavaja, etc., have all their land irrigated. This year, new projects that are being built or have been partially put into production include: the Cijeh Canal in the Debar district, the Erzen Canal and the Blari Canal in the Tirana district, the Pepel Reservoir and the Dovti Reservoir in the Gjirokastra district, and some electric water pumps installed in the districts of Berat, Durres, Gramsh, and Tepelena.
