Japanese workers, students, and women, along with friends from the trade sector, numbering over 300, held a grand gathering with the crew members of four Chinese cargo ships—"Truth," "Vanguard," "Huai'an," and "Chang'an"—currently docked in Kobe, to celebrate the fourth anniversary of Chinese ships sailing to Japan.

This gathering was organized by the Kansai, Tokai, and Hokuriku regions of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) and various organizations of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association. Overseas Chinese patriots from the Kansai region also participated in the gathering.

This gathering was held after the Japanese government authorities recently unreasonably obstructed the crew of the Chinese cargo ship "East Wind" from disembarking and disrupted the activities of Japanese friends celebrating the fourth anniversary of Chinese ships sailing to Japan, which was met with strong opposition and condemnation from various sectors of Japanese society. The Japanese people fought for and won the right to hold this gathering.

On the morning of the fourth, people arrived at the outdoor venue on the grasslands, full of joy and excitement.

In the center of the front of the venue stood a giant portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao.

The attendees held high the red revolutionary classic—*Quotations from Chairman Mao*—and repeatedly expressed their heartfelt wishes for the long life of the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao!

Rainomiya Reizo, the chairman of the Osaka Prefecture branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine), spoke at the gathering, saying, "The great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: 'At present, the world revolution has entered a great new era.' The sound of cannons from the great proletarian cultural revolution led by Chairman Mao, which has great historical significance, is shaking the entire world. Under the guidance of great Mao Zedong Thought, socialist China has become a strong bastion of the world revolution. We regard the brilliant achievements of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution as our own achievements and feel extremely happy."

Rainomiya spoke about the rapid development of the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic struggle and strongly condemned the Japanese reactionaries for following American imperialism, obstinately pursuing the Japan-U.S. "security system," reviving Japanese militarism, and brutally suppressing the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic just struggle. He also condemned their collusion with other American puppets and lackeys to form an anti-China encirclement.

Rainomiya mentioned the recent unreasonable obstruction by the Japanese government authorities of the crew of the Chinese cargo ship "East Wind" from disembarking, saying that this crime immediately met with strong opposition from the broad masses of the Japanese people.

Rainomiya said, "Today, we are able to successfully hold this gathering here, which is a victory for the combat friendship and unity of the peoples of China and Japan, and a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought."

Rainomiya said, "American imperialism, the Sato government of Japan, Soviet modern revisionism, and the Miyamoto clique are doing everything they can to try to sabotage the combat friendship between the peoples of China and Japan, but they will not have a good outcome. As Chairman Mao has pointed out: 'The enemy is rotting away day by day, while we are improving day by day.' This is the main trend of history today, which no force can stop."

Rainomiya finally emphasized that we must study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, further develop the combat friendship between the peoples of China and Japan, and strive for greater victories.

Yang Fengqing, the political commissar of the "Truth," spoke on behalf of the Chinese crew members, expressing heartfelt thanks to the Japanese friends for their enthusiastic and friendly reception and for the great help they have given to Chinese cargo ships sailing to Japan over the past four years.

Yang Fengqing emphasized that the peoples of China and Japan have united and fought together in the struggle against our common enemy, American imperialism. The peoples of China and Japan are true friends. The friendship between China and Japan is the common wish of the peoples of the two countries, and this is a historical trend that no force can stop.

Yang Fengqing said, "American imperialism and its lackeys are most afraid of the peoples of China and Japan uniting, trying to drive a wedge between our two peoples. The Japanese reactionaries have always followed the Americans in their hostility towards China, sabotaging the friendship between the peoples of China and Japan."

Yang Fengqing pointed out that the recent unreasonable obstruction by the Japanese reactionary authorities of Chinese crew members from disembarking is another new crime of the Japanese reactionary authorities in their hostility towards China and sabotage of the friendship between the peoples of China and Japan.

Yang Fengqing emphasized that whoever is hostile to China and sabotages the friendship between the peoples of China and Japan will not have a good outcome.

Yang Fengqing said, "We came to Japan and saw that the Japanese people love Chairman Mao very much, actively study Chairman Mao's works, and seek truth. We saw that the Japanese people are bravely fighting against American aggression and oppression."

Yang Fengqing said, "The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: 'The Japanese nation is a great nation. It will never allow American imperialism to ride roughshod over it for long.' 'The Chinese people have always, do now, and will in the future firmly support the Japanese people's patriotic just struggle.' He said, 'We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's great teachings, strengthen and develop the combat friendship between the peoples of China and Japan, and fight against our common enemy, American imperialism.'"

A representative of the young farmers from Sanrizuka, Chiba Prefecture, who are fighting against the construction of a new international airport by the American-Japanese reactionaries, attended the gathering and introduced their brave struggle.

At the gathering, Chinese crew members presented Mao badges to Japanese friends. The Japan International Trade Promotion Association presented Mao badges specially made for the fourth anniversary of Chinese ships sailing to Japan to the Chinese crew members.

The meeting also read congratulatory telegrams from the headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) and other organizations.

Later, Chinese crew members and Japanese friends had a friendly discussion.

At the gathering, a Mao Zedong Thought art troupe organized by Japanese friends and a Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team organized by Chinese crew members performed many revolutionary art programs, which were warmly welcomed by the attendees. The gathering ended in victory with everyone singing the "Internationale" in a grand voice.

　　加强中日人民战斗友谊反对共同敌人
　　日工人学生冲破重重阻碍同中国船员联欢庆祝我船舶航行日本四周年
　　日中友协（正统）和我船员代表发言指出帝修反破坏两国人民友好绝不会有好下场
    新华社五日讯　东京消息：日本京都、大阪、神户等地的工人、学生、妇女和友好贸易界人士三百多人，四日在神户的六甲山，同目前停泊在神户港的“真理”号、“先锋”号、“淮安”号和“长安”号等四艘中国货轮的船员们举行了盛大的联欢会，热烈庆祝中国船舶航行日本四周年。
    这次联欢会是关西地区、东海地区和北陆地区的日中友好协会（正统）组织和日本国际贸易促进协会的各个组织联合举办的。关西地区的旅日爱国华侨也参加了这次联欢会。
    这次联欢会是在日本政府当局不久前无理阻挠中国货轮“东风”号船员上岸、并破坏日本朋友举行庆祝中国船舶航行日本四周年的活动，因而遭到日本各界人士坚决反对和强烈谴责之后，由日本人民通过斗争争取得来的。
    四日上午，人们兴高采烈地陆续地来到设在野外草地上的会场。
    会场前方中央，耸立着伟大领袖毛主席的巨幅照片。
    与会者高举着红彤彤的革命宝书——《毛主席语录》，一再衷心祝愿世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！
    日中友好协会（正统）大阪府总部理事长雨宫礼三在联欢会上发表讲话说，伟大领袖毛主席英明地指出：“当前，世界革命进入了一个伟大的新时代。”毛主席亲自领导的具有伟大历史意义的中国无产阶级文化大革命走向全面胜利的炮声震撼着全世界。在伟大的毛泽东思想指引下，社会主义中国已经成为世界革命的坚强堡垒。我们把中国无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌成就，看作是自己的成就，因而感到无比高兴。
    雨宫谈到了日本人民的反美爱国斗争的迅速发展，并强烈谴责日本反动派追随美帝国主义，顽固地推行日美“安全体制”，复活日本军国主义，疯狂地镇压日本人民的反美爱国正义斗争，同美帝的其它傀儡和走狗加紧拼凑反华包围圈等一系列严重罪行。
    雨宫谈到最近日本政府当局无理阻挠中国货轮“东风”号船员上岸的反华罪行时说，这个罪行立即遭到了广大日本人民的坚决反对。
    雨宫说，今天我们能够在这里成功地举行这个联欢会，是日中两国人民的战斗友谊和团结的胜利，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    雨宫说，美帝国主义、日本佐藤政府、苏联现代修正主义和宫本集团千方百计地企图破坏日中两国人民的战斗友谊，但是他们绝不会有好下场。正如毛主席所指出：“敌人一天天烂下去，我们一天天好起来”。这是今天历史的主流，是任何力量也阻挡不了的。
    雨宫最后强调指出，我们必须活学活用毛泽东思想，进一步发展日中两国人民的战斗友谊，争取更大的胜利。
    “真理”轮的政治委员杨峰青代表中国船员讲话，他对日本朋友的热情友好的接待和四年来日本朋友为中国货轮航行日本所给予的大力帮助，表示衷心感谢。
    杨峰青强调指出，中日两国人民在反对共同敌人美帝国主义的斗争中，团结在一起，战斗在一起。中日两国人民是真正的朋友。中日两国人民的友好是两国人民的共同愿望，这是任何力量也不能阻挡的历史潮流。
    杨峰青说，美帝国主义及其走狗们最害怕中日两国人民团结起来，企图离间我们两国人民。日本反动派一贯追随美帝敌视中国，破坏中日两国人民的友谊。
    杨峰青指出，最近日本反动当局无理阻挠中国船员上岸，这是日本反动当局敌视中国和破坏中日两国人民的友好的又一新的罪行。
    杨峰青强调指出，谁敌视中国，谁破坏中日两国人民的友好，谁就绝不会有好下场。
    杨峰青说，我们来到日本，看到日本人民非常热爱毛主席，积极学习毛主席著作，寻求真理，看到日本人民反对美帝的侵略和压迫进行着英勇的斗争。
    杨峰青说，伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“日本民族是一个伟大的民族。它是绝不会让美帝国主义长期骑在自己头上的。”“中国人民过去、现在和将来都坚决支持日本人民的爱国正义斗争。”他说，我们一定遵循毛主席的伟大教导，为加强和发展中日两国人民的战斗友谊，为反对中日两国人民的共同敌人美帝国主义而斗争。
    正在为反对美日反动派修建新国际机场而进行斗争的千叶县三里塚的青年农民代表出席了联欢会，并向与会者介绍了他们英勇斗争的事迹。
    在会上，中国船员向日本朋友赠送了毛主席像章。日本国际贸易促进协会向中国船员赠送了他们为庆祝中国船舶航行日本四周年特制的毛主席像章。
    大会还宣读了日中友好协会（正统）总部等团体的贺电。
    随后，中国船员和日本朋友亲切地进行了座谈。
    会上，由日本朋友组织的毛泽东思想文艺演出队和中国船员们组织的毛泽东思想宣传队表演了许多革命文艺节目，受到人们的热烈欢迎。联欢会最后在全体高唱《国际歌》的雄伟声中胜利结束。
