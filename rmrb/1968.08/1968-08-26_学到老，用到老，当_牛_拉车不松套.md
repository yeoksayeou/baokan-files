	The Chinese Khrushchev says that without knowledge of "mathematics and physics textbooks," it is difficult to study Chairman Mao's thoughts. This is sheer nonsense. Chairman Mao's books are written for us workers and peasants. Chairman Mao's words are spoken for us workers and peasants. We not only understand Chairman Mao's works but also use them effectively. Even if there are immense difficulties, we can overcome them. The Chinese Khrushchev wants to scare us with the lack of textbook knowledge, preventing us from studying Chairman Mao's works. This is absolutely impossible, a thousand times impossible, ten thousand times impossible!

	In the old society, I had no house and no land. At the age of eight, I started working for the landlord's family, taking care of children. I never attended school and was illiterate. At first, when I started studying the "Three Articles," I faced many difficulties. But I thought, as long as we have the spirit of "resolving to overcome a thousand hardships and ten thousand obstacles to win victory," we can trample all difficulties underfoot.

	As soon as the Cultural Revolution began, I carried the "Three Articles" and the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" with me, studying whenever I had time and asking others whenever I had questions. I pondered over every sentence and memorized every word. After Chairman Mao issued the call to "hold study classes, which is a good method," our brigade set up many study classes. I also organized a study class with seven or eight old women, repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the brilliant works of the "Three Articles." A handful of class enemies in our village were terrified and set up a "Three Kingdoms Performance," using "Three Heroes and Five Gallants" and other trash to poison the youth, opposing our study classes. This was a struggle for the socialist front. We poor and lower-middle peasants immediately exposed them and gave them a thorough criticism and struggle. After that, our Mao Zedong Thought study classes became better and better, and our enthusiasm for studying Chairman Mao's works grew stronger. We used Mao Zedong Thought more effectively.

	Last autumn, when the rice in our brigade was almost ripe, everyone chose me to guard the rice fields. At first, I thought this job involved dealing with chickens, pigs, and sparrows all day, without rest, and might even cause illness. Should I do it or not? As soon as this selfish thought arose, I used Chairman Mao's teachings of "completely selfless and dedicated to others" and "having no selfishness at all" to dispel it. I made up my mind not only to do the job but to do it well. So, every day, I patrolled the rice fields like a soldier on guard duty, running east and west. I felt that just guarding the fields without loss was not "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, so I used every opportunity to contribute to the collective. Once, it rained, and the harvested rice that hadn't been taken away was left on the ridges, with some of the rice ears soaked in water. I went to the fields early in the morning and carried the rice to higher ground, trip after trip, until it was dark before I finished. I saw rice grains scattered on the ridges and carefully swept them up with a broom, sweeping seven baskets in one day, a total of more than twenty baskets. Recently, the brigade asked me to guard the potatoes. Every time I went to the fields, I carried a manure basket, picking up manure and pulling weeds. Basket after basket of manure and bundle after bundle of weeds were all handed over to the collective. I picked up more than three thousand pounds of manure alone. Once, the brigade's donkey gave birth to a foal, and peanut oil was needed for delivery. I brought a pound of peanut oil from home to the brigade. The production team wanted to return it to me, but I refused. I thought, in the old society, I couldn't even eat a drop of oil. If it weren't for Chairman Mao, how could I have today's happy life! Dr. Norman Bethune dedicated his life to the Chinese revolution. What is one pound of oil compared to that!

	Every line and sentence of Chairman Mao's brilliant work, the "Three Articles," shines with the spirit of "publicness." The more I study, the brighter my heart becomes, and the more I use it, the more I love Chairman Mao. The more the Chinese Khrushchev opposes our study of Chairman Mao's works, the more we must study them well. Study every day, use every day, study for life, use for life. Like Comrade Meng Qing, pull the revolutionary cart for life, be the people's "bull" for life. Be a "bull" to the end, pull the cart without loosening the harness.

    学到老，用到老，当“牛”拉车不松套
    上苑公社暴峪泉大队贫农老大娘　康福贵
    中国赫鲁晓夫胡说什么没有“数学、物理的书本”知识，“学习毛泽东思想就相当困难”。这完全是瞎说八道。毛主席的书，是为咱工农写的。毛主席的话，是为咱工农说的。毛主席的著作我们不仅学得懂，而且用得灵。即使有天大的困难，我们也能克服。中国赫鲁晓夫想用没有书本知识来吓唬我们，不让我们学习毛主席著作，一千个办不到，一万个办不到！
    我在旧社会，房无一间，地无一垄，八岁就给地主家带孩子，没进过学校门，是个“斗大的字不识半升”的受苦人。一开始学“老三篇”，困难真是不少。可是我想，只要有“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的精神，什么困难也能踩在脚下。
    文化大革命一开始，我就把“老三篇”和《毛主席语录》揣在怀里，抽空就学，见人就问，一句一句琢磨，一个字一个字地往脑子里记。毛主席发出“办学习班，是个好办法”的伟大号召之后，我们大队办起了很多学习班。我也和七、八个老大娘组织了一个老人学习班，一遍一遍地学习毛主席的最新指示和光辉著作“老三篇”。我们村的一小撮阶级敌人见了吓破了胆，办了个“三国演场”，用“三侠剑”、“七侠五义”等破烂货毒害青年，和我们的学习班唱对台戏。这是在和社会主义争夺阵地。我们贫下中农马上就把他们揪出来狠批狠斗。打那以后，我们的毛泽东思想学习班越办越好，学习毛主席著作的劲头更大，我们对毛泽东思想用得更活。
    去年秋天，队上水稻快熟了，大家选我去看稻地。一开始我想，这个活茬，整天和鸡、猪、麻雀打交道，没晌没夜这不算，弄不好还闹身毛病。我干不干？这个“私”字一冒头，我就用毛主席“毫不利己专门利人”，“毫无自私自利之心”的教导，把它打掉。我下定决心，不但要干，还要干好。这样，我每天就象战士站岗放哨一样，在稻地里东跑西颠。我觉得光看好不丢，还不算“完全”“彻底”为人民服务，就利用一切机会，多为集体出力气。有一次下雨，割下的稻子没来得及拉走，放在畦埂上的稻穗，有的泡在水里。我一大早就下地，一趟又一趟地把稻子背到地头高处，直到天黑才背完。我看到地头上有掉下的稻粒，就用笤帚认真细致地扫起来，一天扫了七麻袋，前后共扫了二十多麻袋。前些时，队里叫我看土豆，我每次下地，都背着粪筐，见粪就拾，见草就拔。满筐满筐的粪，大捆大捆的草，全部交给集体，光拾粪就拾了三千多斤。有一次队上的驴下驹，需要花生油助产。我从家里拿了一斤花生油给队上。生产队要还给我，我不要。我想，在旧社会，我连个油星都吃不上，要不是毛主席，我那有今天的幸福生活！白求恩同志为了中国革命，贡献了自己的生命，我为集体献一斤油又算什么！
    毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”，每一行、每一句都闪耀着一个“公”字，我越学心里越亮堂，越用就越热爱毛主席。中国赫鲁晓夫越是反对我们学习毛主席著作，我们越是要学好毛主席著作。天天学，天天用，学到老，用到老。象门合同志那样，拉一辈子革命车，当一辈子人民的“牛”。当“牛”当到底，拉车不松套。
