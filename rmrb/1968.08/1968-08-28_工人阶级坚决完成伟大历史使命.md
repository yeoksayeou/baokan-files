The working class is resolutely completing its great historical mission. The capital's workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team, Zhou Shixin

This August is an extraordinary month, the happiest and most unforgettable month for our working class. In August, Beijing became an ocean of happiness, with the shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao!" and "Wish Chairman Mao eternal life!" echoing through the skies.

During these days, the campus of Tsinghua University was adorned with red flags and filled with the sound of drums. The members of the capital's workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team were brimming with enthusiasm and their hearts were surging with emotion. On August 5th, Chairman Mao sent us the most precious gift—mangos. On August 15th, Chairman Mao received the capital's workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team and workers' representatives and issued his latest directive: "Our country has a population of 700 million. The working class is the leading class. We must fully bring into play the leading role of the working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in all work. The working class must also continuously raise its political consciousness in the course of struggle." This is Chairman Mao's greatest concern, support, encouragement, and exhortation to our working class.

These days are also the happiest days of my life. On August 5th, I personally received the precious gift from Chairman Mao. On August 15th, I, along with other worker comrades, was warmly received by our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin, and I even ascended the rostrum of the Great Hall of the People and shook hands with Chairman Mao.

Just as we were immersed in this glory and happiness, we received the latest directive from our beloved sun, Chairman Mao: "To carry out the proletarian educational revolution, it is necessary for the working class to take the lead, for the working class to participate, and for the PLA soldiers to cooperate with the students, teachers, and workers in the schools who are determined to carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end, to form a revolutionary tripartite alliance. The workers' propaganda teams should stay in the schools for a long time, participate in all the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and permanently lead the schools. In the countryside, the schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants." This is Chairman Mao's greatest trust and expectation of our working class.

Chairman Mao's latest directive points out the direction and path for the proletarian educational revolution, serving as a sharp weapon to thoroughly smash the bourgeois educational system and creating a new era of proletarian leadership in culture and education in human history.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! You are the closest and dearest person to our working class. Only you regard our working class so highly. In the dark old society, the capitalists treated us like cattle and horses, depriving us of the right to education. After liberation, we workers became masters of the country, but the Chinese Khrushchev attempted to restore capitalism and implemented the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, still excluding our working class from the educational front and plotting to turn the educational front into a stronghold for their restoration of capitalism. It is you who support us workers, allowing us to lead cultural education and lead everything, thus pronouncing the death sentence on the bourgeois intellectuals who have ruled our cultural and educational front for so long. The Tsinghua Garden, which has been ruled by bourgeois intellectuals for many years, has gained new life under the radiance of your brilliant thoughts.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Following your great teachings, the capital's workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team entered Tsinghua University. Although the time is short, we have undergone great tempering and have made great political progress. When we entered Tsinghua, a handful of class enemies hiding in the gutters deceived some of the masses and obstructed and threatened our workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team. We, the working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought, stood firm against this evil wind. As they adopted various means to disrupt our workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team from completing our glorious and great historical mission, we, with the help of the PLA and the enthusiastic support of the revolutionary students, teachers, and workers of Tsinghua University, foiled the plots of this handful of class enemies and created an unprecedentedly good situation for the proletarian cultural revolution at Tsinghua University.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! You support us workers, asking us to fully play our leading role and lead everything. We workers will surely make you proud. We are determined to strive to learn and apply your brilliant thoughts, resolutely learn, use, and propagate your series of latest directives, and ensure that there is only one center in our minds, which is the proletarian headquarters headed by you and Vice Chairman Lin. Let all the "multi-center theory" and "self-centered" ideas go to hell. In our hearts, there is only one thought, which is your brilliant thought; in our actions, there is only one line, which is your proletarian revolutionary line.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! The heavens and the earth are not as great as your kindness. Parents are not as dear as you. You care for us, trust us, and support us like this. We workers will forever be loyal to you. We will, under the command of the proletarian headquarters headed by you and Vice Chairman Lin, unify our understanding, steps, and actions, resolutely defend your latest directives, enthusiastically propagate your latest directives, and fully implement your latest directives. We must lead the schools well and carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end.

    工人阶级坚决完成伟大历史使命
    首都工人毛泽东思想宣传队　周世信
    今年的八月，是不平凡的一个月，是我们工人阶级最幸福最难忘的一个月。八月的北京，成了幸福的海洋，
  “毛主席万岁！”“祝毛主席万寿无疆！”的欢呼声，响彻云霄。
    在这些日子里，清华园内到处红旗招展，锣鼓震天，我们首都工人毛泽东思想宣传队的同志更是激情满怀，心潮澎湃。八月五日，毛主席他老人家给我们送来了最最珍贵的礼物——芒果；八月十五日，毛主席他老人家又接见了首都工人毛泽东思想宣传队和首都工人代表，并发出了最新指示：“我国有七亿人口，工人阶级是领导阶级。要充分发挥工人阶级在文化大革命中和一切工作中的领导作用。工人阶级也应当在斗争中不断提高自己的政治觉悟。”这是毛主席他老人家对我们工人阶级的最大关怀、最大支持、最大鼓舞、最大鞭策。
    这些日子，也是我一生中最幸福的日子。八月五日，我亲手接过毛主席给我们的珍贵礼物；八月十五日，我又和其他工人同志一道受到了我们伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席的亲切接见，还登上了人民大会堂的主席台，和毛主席他老人家握了手。
    正当我们沉浸在这光荣和幸福的时候，又传来了我们心中的红太阳毛主席的最新指示：“实现无产阶级教育革命，必须有工人阶级领导，必须有工人群众参加，配合解放军战士，同学校的学生、教员、工人中决心把无产阶级教育革命进行到底的积极分子实行革命的三结合。工人宣传队要在学校中长期留下去，参加学校中全部斗、批、改任务，并且永远领导学校。在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校。”这是毛主席他老人家对我们工人阶级的最大信任，最大期望。
    毛主席的最新指示，指出了无产阶级教育革命的方向和道路，是彻底摧毁资产阶级教育制度的锐利武器，在人类历史上开创了无产阶级领导文化教育的新纪元。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您是我们工人阶级最亲最亲的亲人，只有您，把我们工人阶级看得这样重，看得这样高。在黑暗的旧社会，资本家把我们当牛马，剥夺了我们受教育的权利。解放了，我们工人当家做了主人，可是中国赫鲁晓夫妄图复辟资本主义，推行反革命修正主义路线，仍然把我们工人阶级排斥在教育阵地之外，阴谋把文化教育阵地变成他们复辟资本主义的顽固堡垒。是您，给我们工人阶级撑腰，让我们工人阶级领导文化教育，领导一切，从而宣判了资产阶级知识分子统治我们文化教育战线的死刑。资产阶级知识分子统治多年的清华园，在您的光辉思想的照耀下，也从此获得了新生。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！我们首都工人毛泽东思想宣传队遵照您的伟大教导，进驻清华大学。虽然时间不长，但我们受到了很大的锻炼，在政治上有了很大提高。我们进驻清华时，一小撮躲在阴沟里的阶级敌人，蒙蔽部分群众，对我们工人毛泽东思想宣传队进行阻挠和威胁。我们用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级，顶住了这股妖风。随着他们又采取种种手法，妄图干扰我们工人毛泽东思想宣传队完成光荣的伟大历史使命。我们工人毛泽东思想宣传队，在解放军的帮助下，在清华大学的革命学生、教员、工人的热情支持下，粉碎了这一小撮阶级敌人的阴谋，创造了清华大学无产阶级文化大革命的空前大好形势。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您老人家给我们工人阶级撑腰，要我们充分发挥领导作用，领导一切，我们工人阶级一定给您老人家争气，我们决心努力活学活用您的光辉思想，坚决学好、用好、宣传好您的一系列最新指示，一定做到头脑中只有一个中心，就是以您为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，什么“多中心论”、“以我为中心”都统统见鬼去吧。我们心窝里只有一个思想，就是您的光辉思想；行动上只有一条路线，就是您的无产阶级革命路线。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！天大地大不如您的恩情大，爹亲娘亲不如您老人家亲。您这样关怀我们、信任我们、支持我们，我们工人阶级永远忠于您。我们一定在以您为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的号令下，统一认识、统一步伐、统一行动，坚决捍卫您的最新指示，热情宣传您的最新指示，全面落实您的最新指示，一定要把学校领导好，把无产阶级教育革命进行到底。
