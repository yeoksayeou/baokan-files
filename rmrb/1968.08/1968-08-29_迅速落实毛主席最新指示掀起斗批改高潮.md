In the new upsurge of the mass movement across the country to study, propagate, and implement the latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao, exciting news has come from the frontline of the struggle to aid Vietnam and resist America: the Revolutionary Committee of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has been born in glory amidst a great situation both domestically and internationally. The hundreds of millions of military and civilian personnel across the country enthusiastically acclaim the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and are determined to better follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, "fully play the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work," earnestly carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The news has spread, and the entire country is in a state of excitement. From the banks of the Heilongjiang to the shores of the Zhujiang, from the coasts of the East China Sea to the foothills of the Tian Shan Mountains, broad masses of revolutionaries are excitedly raising their arms and shouting: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" Revolutionary committees in various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have sent congratulatory telegrams to the Guangxi Revolutionary Committee, and many places have held celebratory rallies. People in various places are happy, saying that recently there have been many joyous events, and good news has been coming one after another. Chairman Mao has issued a series of latest instructions on fully playing the leading role of the working class. The provinces of Yunnan in the southwest of the motherland and Fujian on the coastal defense line have successively established revolutionary committees. Immediately after that, the Revolutionary Committee of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has been born in victory. In many places, the mighty army of industrial workers has marched into schools, and the situation of the proletarian Cultural Revolution across the country is unprecedentedly good and getting better. The hundreds of millions of military and civilian personnel have expressed that they will definitely, under the unified command of the proletarian headquarters with Chairman Mao as the commander-in-chief and Vice Chairman Lin as the deputy, fight a brilliant battle of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and carry the proletarian Cultural Revolution to victory.

Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "To achieve the proletarian educational revolution, it is necessary to have the leadership of the working class and the participation of the working masses, in conjunction with the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, to form a revolutionary tripartite alliance with the students, teachers, and workers in schools who are determined to carry the proletarian educational revolution to the end. The workers' propaganda teams should stay in the schools for a long time to participate in all tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and permanently lead the schools. In the countryside, the schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants." "Establish revolutionary committees with a tripartite alliance, carry out a great criticism, clean up the class ranks, rectify the party, streamline organizations, reform unreasonable regulations and systems, and transfer office personnel. The struggle, criticism, and transformation in factories generally go through these stages." Members of revolutionary committees at all levels across the country and the hundreds of millions of military and civilian personnel, while enthusiastically acclaiming the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, have once again seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions of great strategic significance. They unanimously pointed out that Chairman Mao's latest instructions are the new call to advance for achieving a comprehensive victory in the proletarian Cultural Revolution, the guiding light for completing the great historical task of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and the long-term plan for ensuring that the proletarian state of ours will never change color. They unanimously expressed that they will definitely, under the command of the proletarian headquarters with Chairman Mao as the commander-in-chief and Vice Chairman Lin as the deputy, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, fully and swiftly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and actively participate in the great upsurge of struggle, criticism, and transformation.

The broad masses of workers in major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin, as well as the provincial capitals and the capitals of autonomous regions, are jubilantly celebrating the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. Revolutionary masses in various places pointed out that the victorious birth of the Guangxi Revolutionary Committee once again proves that following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment is victory, fully implementing Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions is victory, and resolutely carrying out the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters with Chairman Mao as the commander-in-chief and Vice Chairman Lin as the deputy is victory. They expressed that they will definitely continue to select more outstanding workers to participate in the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in the educational front and all fields of the superstructure, and better shoulder the responsibility of combining revolution with production, and complete the great historical mission entrusted by Chairman Mao. Workers in the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams who have already entered colleges and universities in various cities were greatly inspired by the news of the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. They said with high spirits, "We, the working class, will not disappoint the great leader Chairman Mao's expectations for us and will definitely shoulder the responsibility of leading everything well!"

Members of revolutionary committees at all levels and the broad masses of revolutionaries in various places expressed that they will definitely implement Chairman Mao's various tasks, such as establishing revolutionary committees at all levels, carrying out great criticism, cleaning up the class ranks, rectifying the party, streamlining organizations, and educational revolution, etc., item by item, make plans, and carry them out in earnest, and both vigorously and solidly launch the upsurge of struggle, criticism, and transformation. The Shanghai Radio Factory No. 7 is about to send out the second batch of outstanding workers to participate in the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams. The factory's task of combining revolution with production is very heavy. Workers who remain in the factory expressed that they will definitely shoulder the heavy responsibility of combining revolution with production with tenfold revolutionary enthusiasm, and with more outstanding revolutionary and production achievements, repay the great leader Chairman Mao's trust and care for the working class. Revolutionary teachers and students of the Railway Signal Specialty Company of Lanzhou Railway Academy, who are conducting an educational revolution pilot project on the railway line from Baotou to Lanzhou, expressed that they will unswervingly advance along the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, and under the leadership of the working class, carry the proletarian educational revolution to the end.

The broad cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army fighting on the frontlines of "three supports and two militaries" in various places, as well as representatives participating in the Mao Zedong Thought study classes of the National Defense Office, firmly expressed that they will definitely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and resolutely support all revolutionary actions and pioneering spirit of the working class. They said, "The working class must lead everything, and the working class can lead everything. We will definitely closely unite with the working class and complete the great historical mission entrusted by Chairman Mao." Soldiers of the People's Liberation Army guarding the national border and coastal defense lines, and militia in various places regard the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region as a heavy blow to the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and reactionaries of all countries, and a major support for the Vietnamese people who are waging an anti-American, national salvation war. Soldiers of a certain air force unit who have achieved three victories in three battles in defending the national airspace in the Guangxi region said, "We will definitely remember Chairman Mao's great teaching of 'The rights obtained by the people must not be allowed to be easily lost and must be defended by struggle,' bravely defend the newly born revolutionary committees at all levels, and resolutely smash all sabotage activities of the class enemies both at home and abroad." Officers and soldiers of a certain border outpost in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region on the northern border of the motherland said, "We will definitely, like the brave Guangxi military and civilian personnel guarding the southern gate of the motherland, strengthen our preparedness, heighten our vigilance, and guard the northern gate of the motherland well." The Navy unit and the militia of Hainan Island, who are defending the southern border of the motherland side by side with the Guangxi military, expressed that they will definitely severely strike American, Soviet, British spies, and other spy elements, traitors, unrepentant capitalist roaders, and landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who have not been reformed, strictly guard the border and coastal defense, and resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilate all enemies who dare to invade!
