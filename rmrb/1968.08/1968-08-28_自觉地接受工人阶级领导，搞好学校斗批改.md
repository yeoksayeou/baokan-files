In the midst of a great situation across the country, our great teacher Chairman Mao has issued new instructions to us.

Chairman Mao wants the working class to lead the educational revolution and participate in the school's three-in-one leadership team. This is the greatest trust in the working class and an unprecedented great innovation in human history! The working class is the most wise and has the greatest ability to carry out the proletarian educational revolution to the end! The process of our Yanan Middle School carrying out the proletarian educational revolution is a process of learning from the working class and consciously accepting their leadership.

Last year, when our school recruited new students, we didn't know how to do it or which path to take. Everyone was uncertain. So, we went to the factories and countryside to seek the opinions of workers and poor and lower-middle peasants. The workers and poor and lower-middle peasants angrily denounced the heinous crimes of the old education system that excluded the children of workers and peasants from attending school. A daughter of a poor peasant, due to exam anxiety, was excluded from the school gates for several years in a row. The "cutoff score" had become a blockade line preventing the children of workers and peasants from attending school! Every time she failed to enter middle school, her father would say: Chairman Mao gave us the opportunity to study, why doesn't the school gate open for the poor and lower-middle peasants? After hearing the workers and poor and lower-middle peasants denounce the revisionist educational line, we decided to go to the factories and countryside to set up classes for this year's primary school graduates and investigate the recruitment targets. We broke through the old framework of past recruitment work, successfully completed the recruitment task, and received praise from the masses.

On the principle of which direction the school's gate should open, workers and poor and lower-middle peasants have the most say. On the critical issue of which ideology should occupy the school's position and how to educate students, they have even more say. When our school's educational revolution just began, everyone had a sense of difficulty about teaching reforms. How to reform? What should the reforms look like? The word "difficult" blocked the way. In this situation, we organized a teaching reform group to go to the factories and countryside to learn from the workers and poor and lower-middle peasants and seek their opinions. They pointed out bluntly: No matter how many reforms, the most crucial is to let Mao Zedong Thought occupy the school's position. Based on their opinions, we made Mao Zedong Thought the basic textbook for political and language courses, and established the "daily reading" and "speaking and using" sessions as unchangeable institutions. Many teachers and students achieved the goal of studying, criticizing, and comparing, that is, studying Chairman Mao's instructions, criticizing the heinous crimes of China's Khrushchev and his agents, comparing their own thoughts, finding problems, and eliminating toxins, greatly promoting the thought revolution of all teachers and students in the school. Students said: Our school has really changed!

In the graduation assignment work, we also continuously sought advice from workers and poor and lower-middle peasants. We invited them to recall bitterness and sweetness and explain the great significance of going to the mountains and countryside. Under the help of the working class, the broad revolutionary teachers and students made a big fuss about the educational revolution, actively signed up to go to the mountains and countryside, making the graduation assignment work both lively and solid. Many revolutionary little generals have already rushed to the front line of agriculture, and other students are also ready to go.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "To achieve the proletarian educational revolution, there must be leadership from the working class." We deeply feel that only the working class, which is most thorough in revolutionary spirit, can come to the school, participate in all aspects of the struggle, criticism, and reform, and lead the educational revolution. Only in this way can the rotten bourgeois education system be thoroughly smashed, and the proletarian educational revolution achieve thorough victory. All revolutionary teachers and students of Yanan Middle School will consciously accept the leadership of the working class, unite as one, and do a good job in the school's struggle, criticism, and reform!

### 自觉地接受工人阶级领导，搞好学校斗批改

    自觉地接受工人阶级领导，搞好学校斗批改编辑同志：
    在举国上下一片大好形势下，我们伟大导师毛主席又向我们发出了最新指示。
    毛主席要工人阶级领导教育革命，参加学校革命的三结合领导班子，这是对工人阶级的最大信任，是人类历史上前所未有的伟大创举！工人阶级最有智慧，最有能力把无产阶级教育革命进行到底！我们延安中学进行无产阶级教育革命的过程，就是向工人阶级学习，自觉地接受他们领导的过程。
    去年我校招收新生，怎么招法？应该走哪一条路子？大家心里没底。于是我们就到工厂、农村去征求工人和贫下中农的意见。工人和贫下中农愤怒控诉了旧教育制度排斥工农子女入学的滔天罪行。有个贫农的女儿，由于考试晕场，一连几年被排斥在学校大门之外。“分数线”简直成了阻挡工农子女上学的封锁线！每次她考不上中学时，她父亲总是说：毛主席给了咱们上学的机会，为什么学校大门不朝贫下中农开？听了工人和贫下中农对修正主义教育路线的控诉，我们就决定到工厂、农村去办应届小学毕业生学习班，并调查了解招生对象。打破了过去招生工作的旧框框，很好地完成了招生任务，受到群众好评。
    在学校的大门朝哪里开这个原则问题上，工人、贫下中农最有发言权。在用什么思想占领学校阵地、怎样教育学生这个关键问题上，他们就更有发言权。我们学校在教育革命刚开始的时候，大家对教学改革产生了畏难情绪，怎么改？改成什么样子？一个“难”字挡住了去路。在这种情况下，我们组织了教改小组，到工厂、农村向工人和贫下中农学习，征求意见。他们一针见血地指出：千改万改，让毛泽东思想占领学校阵地是最关键的改。我们根据他们的意见，把毛泽东思想作为政治课和语文课的基本教材，把
  “天天读”、“讲用会”定为雷打不动的制度。许多师生都做到了一学、二批、三对照，即学习毛主席的指示，批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的滔天罪行，对照自己的思想，然后找出问题，肃清流毒，大大促进了全校师生的思想革命化。同学们说：我们学校真的变了！
    在毕业分配工作中，我们也是不断向工人和贫下中农请教的。邀请他们忆苦思甜，讲解上山下乡的伟大意义。广大革命师生在工人阶级的帮助下，大闹教育革命，积极报名上山下乡，使毕业分配工作搞得既轰轰烈烈，又扎扎实实。有不少革命小将已奔赴农业第一线，其他同学也都整装待发。
    毛主席指出：“实现无产阶级教育革命，必须有工人阶级领导”。我们深深体会到：只有最富于彻底革命精神的工人阶级到学校来，参加学校中全部斗、批、改，领导教育革命，才能彻底砸烂腐朽的资产阶级教育制度，取得无产阶级教育革命的彻底胜利。我们延安中学全体革命师生一定自觉地接受工人阶级的领导，团结一致，搞好学校的斗、批、改！
