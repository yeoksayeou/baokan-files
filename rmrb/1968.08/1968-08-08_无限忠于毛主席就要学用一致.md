Over the past two years, the hundreds of millions of military personnel and civilians across the nation, under the radiant guidance of Chairman Mao's big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters," have resolutely carried out the great battle command of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. They have smashed the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev and achieved decisive victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and a great victory for the wise leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao.

In the course of the struggle, we have deeply felt that a revolutionary fighter who truly wants to be loyal to Chairman Mao must take the actual problems arising in the struggle, actively learn from and apply Mao Zedong Thought, and always follow Chairman Mao's instructions. For every instruction from Chairman Mao, first, we must study it seriously, and second, we must apply it; we must learn and apply in unison, carry it out resolutely, and implement it thoroughly. Only by repeatedly learning from and applying Mao Zedong Thought in revolutionary struggle can we increasingly deepen our understanding of Chairman Mao's greatness and the immense power of Mao Zedong Thought, and temper our red-hearted loyalty to Chairman Mao. Only by truly understanding and mastering Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in revolutionary practice, constantly raising our class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness, and transforming our worldview, can we firmly establish our proletarian feelings of unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao.

At this critical moment when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is nearing complete victory, a very small number of people have not seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, have not closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, and have not actively carried out the battle commands of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. Instead, they have engaged in "self-centered" activities, have become arrogant, and have distorted the latest instructions. Such people, whose words and deeds do not match and whose inner and outer selves do not match, are typical factionalists and individualists. To those who still cling to the erroneous "self-centered" ideology, we must shout loudly: You are wrong! The entire Party, the entire army, and the entire nation have only one leadership center, and that is the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. The entire Party, the entire army, the entire nation, and all revolutionary masses can only have this one center and cannot have a second center. If you do not resolutely decide to use Mao Zedong Thought to transform your bourgeois worldview and still cling to the erroneous "self-centered" ideology, you will inevitably drift away from and even oppose the proletarian headquarters, falling into the stinking mud of the bourgeoisie!

Vice Chairman Lin has instructed us: "The attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought is a very important issue. We must focus on the attitude towards Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought." At this moment when we are seizing complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it is especially necessary for us to be unconditionally loyal to the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. We must stand more firmly on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, strive to actively learn from and apply Mao Zedong Thought, learn and apply in unison, and ensure that our words and deeds are consistent. For every battle command from the proletarian headquarters, we will carry out those we understand and resolutely carry out those we do not yet understand, deepening our understanding in the process of carrying them out. We pledge to defend the proletarian headquarters, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, and strive for new achievements in seizing complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

　　无限忠于毛主席就要学用一致
　　南京路上好八连
    两年来，全国亿万军民在毛主席的大字报《炮打司令部》的光辉照耀下，坚决贯彻执行以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的伟大战斗号令，粉碎了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，夺取了无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利，是以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部英明领导的伟大胜利。
    在斗争实践中，我们深深体会到，一个革命战士要真正忠于毛主席，就要带着斗争中的实际问题活学活用毛泽东思想，事事听毛主席的话，时时照毛主席的指示办事。对毛主席的每一个指示，第一要认真学，第二要用；要学用一致，坚决照办，彻底贯彻。只有在革命斗争的实践中反复学习、反复运用毛泽东思想，才能越来越深刻地认识毛主席的英明、伟大和毛泽东思想的巨大威力，锤炼对毛主席的赤胆忠心。只有在革命实践中真正理解和掌握毛主席的革命路线，不断提高自己的阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，改造世界观，才能牢固地建立起无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级感情。
    在无产阶级文化大革命接近全面胜利的关键时刻，有极少数人竟然对毛主席的最新指示不认真学习，对毛主席的伟大战略部署不紧跟，对以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的战斗号令不积极贯彻执行，甚至搞什么“以我为中心”，头脑膨胀，歪曲最新指示。这种人言行不一，表里不一，是典型的山头主义、个人主义者。对那些至今还抱着“以我为中心”的错误思想不放的人，我们要大喝一声：你们错了！全党、全军、全国只有一个领导中心，这就是以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部。全党、全军、全国和广大革命群众只能有这样一个中心，不能有第二个中心。如果你们还不痛下决心，用毛泽东思想改造自己的资产阶级世界观，仍然抱着“以我为中心”的错误思想不放，必然会走到脱离以至对抗无产阶级司令部的危险道路上去，陷入资产阶级的臭泥坑！
    林副主席指示我们：“对毛泽东思想抱什么态度，是一个很重要的问题。我们就是要抓对毛主席的态度、对毛泽东思想的态度问题。”当前，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的时刻，特别需要我们对以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的无限忠诚。我们一定更加坚定地站在毛主席革命路线一边，努力活学活用毛泽东思想，学用一致，言行一致。对无产阶级司令部的每一个战斗号令，理解的执行，暂时不理解的也坚决执行，在执行过程中加深理解。我们誓死捍卫无产阶级司令部，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利立新功！　（新华社）
