Chairman Mao has recently pointed out: "Establish revolutionary committees with three-in-one combination, carry out a great criticism, purge the class ranks, rectify the Party, streamline organizations, reform unreasonable regulations, transfer office personnel, and in factories, go through the stages of struggle, criticism, and transformation. This is generally the process."

Chairman Mao's New Battle Order Greatly Boosts the Morale of the Working Class
Firmly Occupy the School Battlefield and Complete the Struggle, Criticism, and Transformation in the Superstructure

The people of our great motherland, from yesterday night to today, have been in a state of great excitement. Millions of workers, revolutionary masses, and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army have been celebrating all night, enthusiastically welcoming the publication of Chairman Mao's extremely important new directive and the important article "The Working Class Must Lead Everything" by Comrade Yao Wenyuan. The unprecedentedly inspiring atmosphere and revolutionary scenes across the country show that a great movement of struggle, criticism, and transformation led by the working class has triumphantly arrived in the midst of a great situation both internationally and domestically!

Chairman Mao has recently pointed out: "To realize the proletarian educational revolution, it is necessary to have the leadership of the working class and the participation of the working masses. They should work together with the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and the active elements among the students, teachers, and workers in the school who are determined to carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end. The worker-propaganda teams should stay in the schools for a long time to participate in all the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and to lead the schools permanently. In the countryside, the schools should be managed by the most reliable ally of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants." The important article by Comrade Yao Wenyuan, which conveys Chairman Mao's great directive, was broadcast last night. Workers, broad revolutionary masses, and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army across the country were all inspired and elated. They beat drums and set off firecrackers, marching through the streets at night, repeatedly shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand years!" Many places' revolutionary workers were so excited that they stayed up all night. They said, Chairman Mao's new directive is a great strategic decision to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and further consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat. It is a brilliant development of Marxism-Leninism. It greatly boosts the morale of the proletariat and smashes the arrogance of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, as well as the arrogance of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries. Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article deeply explains Chairman Mao's new directive, sounding the charge for the great task of struggle, criticism, and transformation under the leadership of the working class. The people of all regions have expressed their determination to rally more closely around the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, "fully play the leading role of the working class in the Cultural Revolution and all work," resolutely criticize the reactionary theory of "multiple centers is no center," thoroughly smash the hidden reactionaries, thoroughly smash all big and small bourgeois "independent kingdoms," and transform the world according to the image of the working class. Let the great thought of Mao Zedong forever occupy all positions, consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, and ensure that our proletarian iron mountain will never change color for thousands of years.

In Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Xi'an, Chengdu, and other major cities where the working class is concentrated, the broad masses of workers are in high spirits, with unprecedented fighting spirit, and are enthusiastically celebrating all night. They joyfully said, Chairman Mao's new directive most concentratedly expresses the will of the proletariat to carry the revolution through to the end, speaking the words in our hearts. We workers find it most heartwarming, most inspiring, and most empowering. Chairman Mao's new directive most profoundly and scientifically summarizes the important experience of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, pointing out the direction and path for achieving a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution, and is a great strategic deployment to prevent revisionism and ensure that the socialist mountain will never change color. It is a great plan for a hundred years and ten thousand years. We workers are determined to complete the great historical mission entrusted to us by Chairman Mao, resolutely occupy the educational battlefield that has been controlled by bourgeois intellectuals, and promote the struggle, criticism, and transformation in all domains of the superstructure.

Chairman Mao's new directive reached the steel city of Anshan, the birthplace of the workers' movement personally opened by Chairman Mao in Anyuan, Harbin, Changchun, Taiyuan, Lanzhou, Shijiazhuang, Baotou, Chongqing, Jinan, and other industrial cities. The broad masses of workers studied all night, had lively discussions, and widely propagated. The steelworkers of Anshan gathered in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, making ironclad vows to the great leader Chairman Mao: Chairman Mao, your new directive we will definitely carry out. With your invincible thought as a weapon, we will definitely lead everything, and wherever we go, we will make it red. The miners of Anyuan Coal Mine excitedly said, long-term revolutionary struggle practice tells us that as long as we are armed with Mao Zedong Thought, we workers will definitely be able to lead everything. "We are not only good at destroying an old world, we will also be good at building a new world," we will definitely create a red proletarian new world. Workers in Harbin, Changchun, Taiyuan, and other places proudly said, Chairman Mao's new directive is a great call to arms, calling on us to achieve new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution; Chairman Mao's new directive is a great mobilization order, mobilizing us to launch a fierce attack on all class enemies; Chairman Mao's new directive is a great march order, inspiring us to advance bravely towards the great goal of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Many places' old workers who suffered deep oppression and exploitation in the old society, after studying Chairman Mao's new directive and Comrade Yao Wenyuan's important article, were extremely moved. They said, Chairman Mao wants us workers to lead the struggle, criticism, and transformation in universities and to lead the schools permanently, thoroughly smashing the ancient reactionary fallacy of "those who labor with their minds rule over others, and those who labor with their strength are ruled by others," and turning over the history that has been turned upside down. This is truly a great innovation! They studied Chairman Mao's new directive, became fearless, and their fighting spirit doubled. Some old workers who had entered the universities proudly said, our country is a proletarian dictatorship, and we workers must lead everything. Who dares to oppose the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and the leadership of the working class, we will seize their power!

The leadership organs of the People's Liberation Army and the broad masses of soldiers in various places held solemn meetings, enthusiastically welcoming the publication of Chairman Mao's new directive. Many places' soldiers of the army, navy, and air force organized large teams of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to go deep into factories, mines, rural areas, and schools, widely propagating Chairman Mao's new directive. The active elements of the entire army in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, such as Feng Fusheng, Zhao Shunyi, and Nian Siuwang, pointed out that the working class is the leading class of the revolution, and the working class must lead everything, transforming the entire world according to the worldview of the working class and creating a new world of Mao Zedong Thought. The soldiers of the entire army's "Model Red Ninth Company," "Air Force Eagles Regiment," "Linfen Brigade," the company where Qiu Shaoyun was formerly stationed, and the unit where Men He was formerly stationed, as well as the soldiers who accompanied the worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to enter the schools, firmly expressed in discussions that the People's Liberation Army, personally founded and led by Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin, is the strong pillar of the proletarian dictatorship and the loyal sons and daughters of the workers and peasants. Chairman Mao instructs us to carry out, Chairman Mao waves his hand, and we advance. We firmly support the vast army of industrial workers entering schools and other units where the struggle, criticism, and transformation have not been well carried out, and we will complete the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation on the educational front and in various domains of the superstructure.

Chairman Mao's new directive reached various rural areas, and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants enthusiastically welcomed it, unanimously expressing their support for the working class leading everything. Chen Yonggui, deputy head of the Shanxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee and secretary of the Dazhai Brigade Party Branch, said, only by firmly grasping the power of the proletarian educational revolution and the leadership of the struggle, criticism, and transformation in the superstructure in the hands of the working class, can we ensure that our socialist mountain will never change color for thousands of years. Zhang Fugui, a national agricultural labor model and responsible person of the preparatory committee of the Shandong Provincial Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Representative Conference, said, Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the countryside, the schools should be managed by the most reliable ally of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants." We poor and lower-middle peasants will definitely manage the rural schools well under the leadership of the working class. Dong Quanzhong, deputy head of the Revolutionary Committee of Cunrui Commune, Huailai County, Hebei Province, and father of the hero Dong Cunrui, excitedly said, we poor and lower-middle peasants will definitely be the most reliable ally of the working class, shoulder the glorious mission entrusted to us by Chairman Mao, and swear to carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end. The responsible person of the poor and lower-middle peasants' representative conference in Lingbao County, Henan Province, expressed that they would definitely send the best representatives of the poor and lower-middle peasants to carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in rural schools according to Chairman Mao's educational line. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in the old revolutionary base areas of Jiangxi Province expressed that they would definitely support the worker elders leading everything under Chairman Mao's command, reforming the superstructure that does not adapt to the socialist economic base, and turning our country into a big school of Mao Zedong Thought.

In many places across the country, from last night to today, broad revolutionary teachers and students, and revolutionary Red Guards have been immersed in a sea of excitement. They studied and discussed all night, marched through the streets, and some held grand welcoming ceremonies for the worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to enter. In the schoolyards and on the streets, there were eye-catching large banners everywhere: "Learn from the working class!" "Salute to the working class!" "Warmly welcome the working class to lead the schools forever!" Many revolutionary teachers and students who had already entered the worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams in colleges and universities said, the worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams brought us Mao Zedong Thought, brought us the noble qualities of the proletariat, and brought us the mirror that reveals class enemies. The worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams are great, we will forever accept the leadership of the working class. Revolutionary teachers and students and revolutionary Red Guards in various places expressed that they would definitely respectfully learn from the working class, resolutely take the road of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers, thoroughly transform the non-proletarian worldview, complete the task of struggle, criticism, and transformation in schools entrusted by Chairman Mao, and carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end.

Revolutionary committees in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions acted swiftly and decisively, taking various measures to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's new directive. Some places' revolutionary committees issued study notices, some had already or were sending large teams of worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to enter schools, and some were holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes to train propaganda team members. Revolutionary committees in all places regarded studying, propagating, and implementing Chairman Mao's new directive as the most important political task at present, determined to use Mao Zedong Thought as the guideline, fully play the leading role of the working class, quickly launch a new high tide of great struggle, criticism, and transformation, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.
