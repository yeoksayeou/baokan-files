	Better Study and Apply Mao Zedong Thought
	Follow Chairman Mao's Great Strategic Deployment

	Beijing Knitting Factory Revolutionary Committee Deputy Director, Old Worker He Genlin

	Our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao's big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters" and a series of wise decisions have sentenced the capitalist headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev to death. This is our great battle program for continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. Over the past two years, hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses across the country, under the wise leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, have united as one, fought bravely, and launched a fierce attack on the capitalist headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev, achieving decisive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	However, we workers deeply understand that the closer the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution gets to complete victory, the more complex and profound class struggle becomes. The enemies of the proletariat always try in every way to interfere with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment from the right or the "ultra-left," attempting to shake the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. Therefore, we must closely unite around the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, further strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, and carry out a thorough and prolonged revolutionary criticism. We must politically, ideologically, and theoretically criticize and expose the clique of capitalist roaders within the Party headed by China's Khrushchev, and eliminate their influence. We must cherish the revolutionary committees born under Chairman Mao's wise decisions as we cherish our eyes, help them consolidate and develop, and ensure they grow healthily along the track of Mao Zedong Thought.

	I am an ordinary worker, elected by the revolutionary masses to lead the Revolutionary Committee. I deeply feel that Chairman Mao is the greatest leader of the working class and the revolutionary people of the entire nation. The proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin is the sole leadership center for the entire Party, the entire army, the entire nation, and the broad revolutionary masses. Whenever we act according to Chairman Mao's instructions and follow the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, we are invincible, and no difficulties are insurmountable; whenever we deviate from Chairman Mao's teachings and violate the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters, we find it hard to move a single step, achieve nothing, and may even slip into dangerous traps. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We must follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and carry out all the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters without the slightest deviation. In the great storms of class struggle and production struggle, we must seize power for the proletariat, use power for the proletariat, and achieve complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, ensuring that the socialist iron mountain will never change color.

　　更好地活学活用毛泽东思想
　　紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署
　　北京针织总厂革委会副主任、老工人　贺根林
    我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席《炮打司令部》的大字报和一系列英明决策，宣判了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部的死刑，是我们在无产阶级专政条件下继续进行革命的伟大战斗纲领。两年来，全国亿万革命群众在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的英明领导下，团结一致，英勇奋战，向以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部发起猛烈进攻，夺得了无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利。
    但是，我们工人阶级深深懂得，无产阶级文化大革命越是接近全面胜利，阶级斗争越是复杂，越是深刻。无产阶级的敌人总是千方百计地企图从右的或极
  “左”的方面干扰毛主席的伟大战略部署，妄图动摇以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部。因此，我们一定要紧紧团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的周围，进一步加强无产阶级专政，深入持久地开展革命的大批判，从政治上、思想上、理论上把中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派批倒批臭，肃清其流毒。我们一定要象爱护眼睛一样，爱护在毛主席的英明决策下诞生的各级革命委员会，帮助它巩固和发展，使它沿着毛泽东思想的轨道健康地成长。
    我是一个普通工人，被革命群众推选到革委会担任领导工作。我深深感到：毛主席是我们工人阶级和全国革命人民最伟大的领袖。以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，是全党、全军、全国和广大革命群众唯一的领导中心。什么时候按照毛主席的指示办事，按照以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的战斗号令行动，就无往而不胜，天大的困难也能克服；什么时候离开了毛主席的教导，违背了无产阶级司令部的战斗号令，就寸步难行，一事无成，甚至会滑到危险的泥坑里去。我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更好地活学活用毛主席著作，无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，不折不扣地执行无产阶级司令部的一切战斗号令，在阶级斗争和生产斗争的大风大浪中为无产阶级掌好权，用好权，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，保证社会主义的铁打江山永不变色。
