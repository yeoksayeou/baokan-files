Iraqi newspapers on August 4th published articles expressing support for the armed struggle of the Palestinian people.

The official government newspaper of Iraq, *Al-Jumhuriya*, in an article emphasized that the armed struggle led by nationalist organizations such as "Fatah" (Palestine Liberation Movement) is the only solution to the Palestinian problem.

The article stated that the Arab people unanimously believe that the Palestinian issue is an Arab issue, and they have rejected from the beginning the resolution on the Middle East issue passed by the United Nations Security Council in November of last year.

The article stressed: "We oppose any concessions or any attitude that would allow the enemy to reap the fruits of aggression."

In another article, *Al-Jumhuriya* also called on revolutionary public opinion to refute the imperialist propaganda that the Arab people cannot defeat Israel.

An article published in *Al-Ahdath* stated: "The Palestinian issue is the means by which we understand who our friends and enemies are—friends will stand by us in times of trouble, and enemies will come up with evil schemes to harm us. Moreover, the Palestinian issue is the standard by which we can judge people's political attitudes in many other aspects."

The article called for providing all kinds of support to the guerrillas who are waging armed struggle in the areas occupied by Israel. The article said: "Revolutionaries should spare no effort to expand the work of the strike forces to liberate the occupied regions. Revolutionaries must make it clear that as long as the Arab Palestinian flag does not fly again over the land of Arab Palestine, and as long as the Arab Palestinians, who have been made homeless by Zionism and imperialism, have not returned to their homes, they will never rest."

　　伊拉克报纸支持巴勒斯坦人民武装斗争
　　武装斗争是解决巴勒斯坦问题的唯一办法
    新华社巴格达四日电  伊拉克报纸四日纷纷发表文章，表示支持巴勒斯坦人民的武装斗争。
    伊拉克政府机关报《共和国报》在一篇文章中强调说，由“法塔赫”（巴勒斯坦解放运动）等民族主义组织领导的巴勒斯坦游击队发动的武装斗争，是解决巴勒斯坦问题的唯一办法。
    文章说，阿拉伯人民一致认为，巴勒斯坦问题是阿拉伯人民的问题，他们从一开始就拒绝联合国安理会去年十一月所通过的关于中东问题的决议。
    文章强调说：“我们反对任何让步或任何能使敌人得到侵略果实的态度。”
    《共和国报》在另一篇文章中，还要求革命的舆论驳斥帝国主义所散布的所谓阿拉伯人民不能打败以色列的谰言。
    《巴格达观察家报》发表的一篇文章说：“巴勒斯坦问题是我们据以了解谁是我们的朋友、谁是我们的敌人的手段——是朋友就会在患难的时刻站到我们方面来，是敌人就会出鬼主意害我们。不仅如此，巴勒斯坦问题也是我们可以判断人们在其他许多方面的政治态度的尺度。”
    文章要求给予正在以色列占领区开展武装斗争的游击队以各种支持。文章说：“革命者应当不遗余力地扩大突击队的工作来解放被（以色列）占领的地区。革命者要让人家知道，只要阿拉伯（巴勒斯坦）国土上空不重新飘扬阿拉伯巴勒斯坦的旗帜，只要被犹太复国主义和帝国主义弄得无家可归的阿拉伯巴勒斯坦人没有重返家园，他们就决不罢休。”
