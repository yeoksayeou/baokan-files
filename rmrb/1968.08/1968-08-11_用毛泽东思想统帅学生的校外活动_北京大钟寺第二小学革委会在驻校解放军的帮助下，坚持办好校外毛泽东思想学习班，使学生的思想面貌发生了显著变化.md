The revolutionary committee of Beijing's Dazhongsi Second Primary School, with the assistance of the stationed People's Liberation Army, has persistently run extracurricular Mao Zedong Thought study classes, leading to significant changes in the students' ideological outlook.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 10th, the revolutionary committee of Beijing's Dazhongsi Second Primary School, with the help of the stationed People's Liberation Army, has persistently run extracurricular Mao Zedong Thought study classes for students. By using Mao Zedong Thought to guide students' extracurricular activities, the students' ideological outlook has undergone significant changes.

This school has 670 students. Shortly after resuming classes and making revolution, they organized students living nearby into groups of three to five, forming over 160 extracurricular Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Whether during regular times or holidays, they insist on activities for two hours each day. Once the activity time arrives, the lively students gather at the study class, first wishing long life to the great leader Chairman Mao, singing "The East Is Red," and studying Chairman Mao's quotations. Then, according to each study class's plan, they engage in various activities. The content of the activities is rich and colorful. The extracurricular study classes are good classrooms for students to learn Mao Zedong Thought and good battlefields for carrying out revolutionary criticism.

Since the extracurricular study classes were established, they have, in conjunction with studying Chairman Mao's latest directives, launched a revolutionary criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line promoted by China's Khrushchev and his advocacy of the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" and other reactionary ideas. In conjunction with the revolutionary criticism, the extracurricular study classes have also carried out class education activities, inviting poor and lower-middle peasants to talk about their family and village histories, inviting revolutionary parents to recall past hardships and sweet memories, and some study classes even dig wild vegetables to make bitter meals.

Since the extracurricular study classes were established, the students' ideological outlook has undergone tremendous changes. They strive to be good children of Chairman Mao, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's directives. The students are united and friendly, helping each other, and good deeds are constantly emerging. The children often clean the public toilets, doors, corridors, and courtyards near the study classes. They also go to canteens, stores, and grain shops to participate in labor, serving as little service personnel, and are praised by the masses and parents.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To grasp ideological education is the key link in uniting the whole Party to wage great political struggles. If this task is not accomplished, all political tasks of the Party cannot be fulfilled." The process of consolidating and developing the extracurricular study classes in this school is a process of continuously carrying out ideological mobilization and strengthening organizational work. The school includes the extracurricular study classes as part of the overall teaching plan. Teachers listen to the reports from the study classes every day, conduct one inspection and guidance session per week, help students summarize experiences, and formulate plans for the next week's activities. Now, the extracurricular study classes in this school are getting better and better. After the summer vacation, the content of the activities has become even richer.

　　用毛泽东思想统帅学生的校外活动
    北京大钟寺第二小学革委会在驻校解放军的帮助下，坚持办好校外毛泽东思想学习班，使学生的思想面貌发生了显著变化
    据新华社十日讯　北京市大钟寺第二小学革命委员会在驻校解放军的帮助下，坚持办好学生校外毛泽东思想学习班，用毛泽东思想统帅学生的校外活动，使学生的思想面貌发生了显著变化。
    这所小学共有学生六百七十多人，今年复课闹革命不久，他们以排（即班级）为单位，把家庭居住靠近的三至五个学生组织在一起，共组成了一百六十多个校外毛泽东思想学习班，无论平时还是假期，每天坚持活动两个小时。活动时间一到，生龙活虎的同学们准时集合在学习班，第一件事是祝愿伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆，高唱《东方红》，学习毛主席语录。然后根据每个学习班的计划，进行各种活动。活动内容丰富多彩。校外学习班是学生们学习毛泽东思想的好课堂，也是开展革命大批判的好战场。
    这个学校的校外学习班开办以来，结合学习毛主席的最新指示，对中国赫鲁晓夫推行的反革命修正主义教育路线和他鼓吹的“阶级斗争熄灭”论等黑货，展开了革命大批判。结合革命大批判，校外学习班还开展了阶级教育活动，请贫下中农讲家史、村史，请革命家长忆苦思甜，有的学习班自己挖野菜做忆苦饭吃。
    自从校外学习班开办以来，学生们的思想面貌发生了巨大变化。他们争当毛主席的好孩子，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。同学们团结友爱，互相帮助，好人好事不断出现。孩子们经常把学习班附近的公共厕所、门窗、楼道、庭院打扫得干干净净。他们还到食堂、商店、粮店去参加劳动，当小服务员，受到广大群众和家长的好评。
    毛主席教导说：“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。如果这个任务不解决，党的一切政治任务是不能完成的。”这个学校校外学习班不断巩固和发展的过程，就是不断地进行思想发动和加强组织工作的过程。学校把办校外学习班列为整个教学计划的一个组成部分，教师每天听取学习班的汇报，每周去校外学习班进行一次检查和辅导，帮助学生总结经验，制订下一周活动的计划。现在，这个学校的校外学习班越办越好，放暑假以后，活动内容更加丰富了。
