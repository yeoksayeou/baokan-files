The Tianjin Agricultural Chemicals Factory Revolutionary Committee was born victorious in the storm of class struggle. How should one treat this new revolutionary government? The People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the factory paid particular attention to this issue. They adopted the correct attitude of being a pillar, not a crutch, protecting, supporting, and helping the Revolutionary Committee, ensuring that the new revolutionary government, under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, continuously consolidates and develops.

Being a Pillar, Not a Crutch

The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the factory, along with the factory's broad masses of revolutionary cadres, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary cadres, had fought side by side for over a year, forming a deep proletarian class sentiment and combat friendship. After the factory established the Revolutionary Committee, the revolutionary cadres and representatives of the revolutionary masses still sought the army's advice and decisions. The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, as before, always responded promptly and agreed to everything, believing this was supporting the Revolutionary Committee.

One day, a committee member of the factory Revolutionary Committee brought a report to be sent to the higher-level Revolutionary Committee, which included a section for "Approval by Stationed Army." This made the comrades of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team think: some committee members, when talking to them, often mentioned "consulting the army." When the Revolutionary Committee discussed issues and made resolutions, they also waited for the army's approval. What did these phenomena indicate? What kind of relationship should the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team establish with the Revolutionary Committee?

The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, with this question in mind, repeatedly studied the resolutions of the Gutian Conference and Mao Zedong's related statements and a series of latest instructions. They realized that the members of the Revolutionary Committee included representatives of the revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres, who were resolute in executing Mao Zedong's revolutionary line and were advanced figures supported by the broad masses. Therefore, the attitude towards the Revolutionary Committee, fundamentally, was an attitude towards Mao Zedong's revolutionary line and the masses. The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team should not act as a crutch for the Revolutionary Committee to lean on but should be a pillar, consciously helping and supporting the Revolutionary Committee in establishing proletarian authority in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation. Whether one could do this ultimately depended on one's worldview. If one believed in oneself more than in the masses and emphasized personal authority, one would inevitably take over and not correctly treat the Revolutionary Committee. Therefore, to thoroughly solve this problem, one must break down private interests and establish public interests, completely eliminating the erroneous thought of "personal authority" from the depths of one's soul.

How could one be a pillar and not a crutch? They summarized the following points through continuous learning from the revolutionary masses and repeated practice.

Being an Advisor, Not a Commander

The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team deeply felt from practice that to fully play the role of the Revolutionary Committee, the most fundamental task was to widely and deeply propagate Mao Zedong Thought, arming the broad revolutionary masses and members of the Revolutionary Committee with Mao Zedong Thought, not placing oneself in the position of a commander but in the position of an advisor, following Mao Zedong's teaching that "the Party committee system is an important Party institution for ensuring collective leadership and preventing individual despotism," fully playing the role of revolutionary cadres as the backbone and revolutionary mass representatives as the foundation.

The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team actively and enthusiastically helped the Revolutionary Committee hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, solving the dependency thoughts of revolutionary cadres and the slackening mood of revolutionary mass representatives, ensuring that they stood at the forefront of every crucial moment in the revolution, becoming the command center for hoisting the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought. Members of the Revolutionary Committee re-studied "The Three Constantly Read Articles" and "Report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China." Through study, they realized that the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee did not mean the end of class struggle but was only the first step of the long march, with a heavy responsibility and a long way to go. The thought of fearing to make mistakes again, depending on the army for everything, and "relaxing a bit" was disloyal to Chairman Mao. Everyone decided to revolutionize to the end, be lifelong servants of the people, dare to take on heavy responsibilities, and dare to fight against difficulties.

On this basis, the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team helped the Revolutionary Committee establish a system to ensure collective leadership. All major issues related to the revolution and production of the entire factory had to be discussed and decided by all committee members before execution. The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team strictly adhered to the principle of "discussing before the meeting, supporting during the meeting, and executing after the meeting," never deciding things on their own. After Mao Zedong's latest instructions and the central government's related policies were issued, the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, with the greatest enthusiasm and the fastest speed, first studied them with the members of the Revolutionary Committee to reach a consensus, and then had the chairman or vice-chairman of the Revolutionary Committee convey and mobilize the revolutionary masses, doing meticulous work to implement them. The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team supported revolutionary cadres going to the front lines of class struggle and production struggle to reform, improve, and temper themselves, establishing authority in the waves of class struggle, and fully playing the role of revolutionary cadres as "team leaders."

Under the enthusiastic support of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, the main members of the Revolutionary Committee fought vigorously on the front lines of class struggle and production struggle. A small handful of class enemies attempted to disrupt production to achieve their goal of overthrowing the new revolutionary government. Some team leaders failed to promptly expose the enemies' tricks. The chairman of the Revolutionary Committee then took two committee members to the workshop, working and chatting with the team leaders, discussing the reality of class struggle, helping them strengthen their class struggle consciousness, supporting them in boldly shouldering the responsibilities of revolution and production, and countering the anti-revolutionary economic wind. The vice-chairman of the Revolutionary Committee and the standing committee member in charge of production went to the first workshop and encountered a production accident. They led the way in wearing protective suits, jumping into a chemical reaction tank with high toxicity to eliminate the fault. Many workers also joined the battle to eliminate the fault, quickly solving the problem. The actual actions of the Revolutionary Committee members deeply moving and educating the broad revolutionary workers, smashing the class enemies' plot to disrupt production, and quickly putting the factory's production back on track.

Being a Student, Not a Referee

To be a good advisor, one must first have the spirit of being a humble student, sincerely learning from the members of the Revolutionary Committee and the broad revolutionary workers, and never pointing fingers or acting as a referee.

Since the factory began to clean up the class ranks, some workshops and teams were once only eager to expose bad people, neglecting revolutionary criticism. How could one use revolutionary criticism as a driving force to deeply carry out the struggle against the enemy? The Revolutionary Committee was temporarily unable to come up with a good solution. The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, on the one hand, suggested that the Revolutionary Committee members conduct in-depth investigations and research, and on the other hand, they themselves went to the third workshop, studying and summarizing with the masses how to combine revolutionary criticism with the cleaning up of class ranks. The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team discovered that the masses in the third workshop used the team as the starting point for revolutionary criticism, utilizing rest time to hold criticism meetings, combining the exposure of class enemies' crimes with the criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies of Chinese Khrushchev, achieving "criticizing while investigating (the enemy), investigating while criticizing, combining criticism and investigation," thereby fully mobilizing the masses and achieving good results. At the suggestion of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, the Revolutionary Committee held a field meeting in the third workshop, further promoting the deep and widespread development of revolutionary criticism and the cleaning up of class ranks throughout the factory.

When the Revolutionary Committee had disagreements on some principle issues, the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team never appeared as a referee, evaluating and commenting, but instead had the Revolutionary Committee hand over the contradictions to the masses, using the method of the mass line to solve them. In this way, they not only helped the Revolutionary Committee unify their thoughts and actions on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought but also helped the Revolutionary Committee further strengthen their ties with the masses. Soon after the Revolutionary Committee was established, the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team suggested that the Revolutionary Committee hold an open rectification meeting, allowing the revolutionary masses to help the Revolutionary Committee members get rid of old thoughts and styles, and establish new thoughts and styles. The broad revolutionary masses sincerely and sharply criticized the bureaucratic style of some Revolutionary Committee members who were detached from production and labor, high above the masses, educating the Revolutionary Committee members greatly. From then on, all members of the Revolutionary Committee actively participated in production labor. The Revolutionary Committee also frequently held meetings with old and new workers, placing the Revolutionary Committee under the supervision of the masses.

Being a Defender, Not an Observer

Just being an advisor and not a commander, does that mean one is always in the second line? No. The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team in this factory stood up clearly and unambiguously in major principles, firmly defending the Revolutionary Committee, and would never act as an observer.

Soon after the factory established the Revolutionary Committee, a small handful of class enemies, unwilling to die, stirred up a wave of anarchism, disrupting production, putting pressure on the new revolutionary government, and attempting to overthrow the Revolutionary Committee. Some workers saw through the class enemies' tricks, posting big-character posters saying "Maintain eight hours of production, revolution in spare time," countering the anarchist trend. The Revolutionary Committee supported the workers' demands, launching a campaign against anarchism. The revolutionary masses throughout the factory quickly mobilized. At this time, a small handful of class enemies played new tricks, spreading rumors that this was persecuting the masses, a new bourgeois reactionary line, etc. Some members of the Revolutionary Committee were temporarily unable to distinguish right from wrong. Just as they were hesitating whether to continue the campaign against anarchism, the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team immediately made it clear in the Revolutionary Committee that they firmly supported the Revolutionary Committee in leading all revolutionary workers to launch a campaign against anarchism. They clearly pointed out that in this struggle, one must firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, smash all the class enemies' tricks. With the support of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, the factory quickly achieved victory in the campaign against anarchism, further consolidating labor discipline, and ensuring the smooth progress of revolution, production, and work.

Chairman Mao said: "It is necessary to guide the petty-bourgeois ideology in our ranks to the revolutionary orbit of the proletariat. This is a key problem for the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." In January of this year, the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team discovered that some revolutionary mass organizations were actively preparing activities to celebrate the first anniversary of their seizure of power in the January revolutionary storm, and some of the leaders of this organization had been elected as vice-chairmen or committee members of the Revolutionary Committee. The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team believed that such activities were not conducive to consolidating the great alliance and the three-in-one combination, and would only cause the bourgeois factionalism to resurface. They immediately invited the leaders of this organization at all levels to talk, telling them why such activities should not be held. They accepted the advice of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, expressing that they would strictly require themselves in everything and everywhere in the future, firmly grasp power for Mao Zedong Thought, and never engage in bourgeois factional activities.

Because the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at this factory had properly handled the relationship with the Revolutionary Committee, the Revolutionary Committee of this factory established high authority in class struggle and production struggle, becoming a strong and powerful command center for all revolutionary workers in the factory. Revolution and production were getting better and better. Since April of this year, the total output value of the entire factory has exceeded the level of the same period in 1966 for three consecutive months.

　　用毛泽东思想挂帅爱护支持新生革命政权
　　——记人民解放军驻天津农药厂毛泽东思想宣传队帮助厂革委会建立革命权威
    天津农药厂革命委员会，在阶级斗争的风暴中胜利地诞生了。怎样对待新生的革命政权？人民解放军驻厂毛泽东思想宣传队十分注意这个问题。他们采取当好支柱，不当“拐棍”的正确态度，爱护、支持、帮助、捍卫革命委员会，使新生的革命政权，在毛泽东思想的哺育下，不断地巩固和发展。
    当好支柱，不当“拐棍”
    驻厂毛泽东思想宣传队同这个厂的广大无产阶级革命派、革命群众和革命干部，经过一年多的并肩战斗，结成了深厚的无产阶级阶级感情和战斗友谊。工厂成立革命委员会以后，革命领导干部和革命群众代表，仍然找解放军想办法，拿主意。毛泽东思想宣传队和过去一样，总是“有求必应，事事点头”，认为这样做就是支持了革委会。
    一天，厂革委会委员送来一份给上级革命委员会的报告，上面增加了一项“驻厂解放军批示”栏，使毛泽东思想宣传队的同志联想到：有的革委会委员同他们谈话时，也往往带上“向驻军请示”的字眼。革委会研究问题，作了决议，也要等着解放军点头。这些现象说明了什么？毛泽东思想宣传队同革委会应该建立一种什么样的关系呢？
    毛泽东思想宣传队带着这个问题，反复学习了古田会议的决议，以及毛主席的有关论述和一系列最新指示。大家认识到，参加革命委员会的成员有革命群众代表，有革命领导干部，他们是坚决执行毛主席的革命路线，为广大群众所拥护的先进人物。因此，对待革命委员会的态度，从根本上说来，就是对待毛主席革命路线的态度，对待群众的态度。毛泽东思想宣传队不应该把自己当成“拐棍”，让革委会拄着走，而应当当好支柱，自觉地帮助、支持革委会在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动中建立无产阶级权威。能不能这样做，归根结底还是一个世界观问题。如果相信自己超过相信群众，突出个人作用，就必然包办代替，不能正确对待革命委员会。因此，要彻底解决这个问题，必须破“私”立“公”，在灵魂深处彻底破除“个人权威”的错误思想。
    怎样才能作到当好支柱，不当“拐棍”呢？他们通过不断地向革命群众学习和反复实践，初步总结了以下几点经验。
　　当好“参谋”，不当“司令”
    毛泽东思想宣传队从实践中深深体会到，要充分发挥革命委员会的作用，最根本的任务是广泛、深入地宣传毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想武装广大革命群众和革委会成员，不把自己摆在“司令”的地位上，而是要放在“参谋”的地位上，按照毛主席“党委制是保证集体领导、防止个人包办的党的重要制度”的教导，充分发挥革命领导干部的骨干作用和革命群众代表的基础作用。
    毛泽东思想宣传队积极热情地帮助革命委员会举办了毛泽东思想学习班，解决革命领导干部的依赖思想和革命群众代表的松劲情绪，使他们在革命的每一个紧要关头，都站在斗争的第一线，成为高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的战斗指挥部。革委会成员在学习班重新学习了“老三篇”和《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》。通过学习，他们认识到，革命委员会的成立并不意味着阶级斗争的结束，而只是万里长征走完了第一步，任重而道远。怕再犯错误，事事依赖解放军和“松一口气”的思想，是对毛主席的不忠。大家决心革命到底，当一辈子人民的勤务员，勇于挑重担，勇于同困难作斗争。
    在这个基础上，毛泽东思想宣传队帮助革委会建立了保证集体领导的制度。凡属全厂性的有关革命和生产的重大问题，都要经全体委员讨论决议后才能执行。毛泽东思想宣传队严格遵守“会前商量，会上支持，会后执行”的原则，绝不自己“说了算”。毛主席的最新指示和中央的有关方针、政策下达后，毛泽东思想宣传队以最大的热情、最快的速度，首先和革命委员会成员一起学习，取得一致认识，然后由革委会主任或副主任向革命群众作传达和动员，作艰苦、细致的落实工作。毛泽东思想宣传队支持革命领导干部到阶级斗争和生产斗争的第一线去改造、去提高、去锻炼，在阶级斗争的风浪中建立威信，充分发挥革命领导干部的“班长”作用。
    在毛泽东思想宣传队的热情支持下，革委会的主要成员，斗志昂扬地战斗在阶级斗争和生产斗争的第一线。一小撮阶级敌人妄想从破坏生产入手，达到他们颠覆新生的革命政权的目的。有的班组长没能够及时识破敌人的诡计。革委会主任就带着两个委员深入车间，和班组长在一起劳动，一起谈心，摆阶级斗争的现实，帮助他们增强阶级斗争观念，支持他们大胆地挑起革命和生产的重担，反击反革命经济主义妖风。革委会副主任和分工抓生产的常委，深入第一车间后，正碰上一次生产事故，他们带头穿上防毒工作服，跳到一个有剧毒的化学反应罐中排除故障，许多工人也纷纷投入排除故障的战斗，很快就解决了故障问题。革委会成员深入第一线抓革命促生产的实际行动，深深地感动和教育了广大革命职工，粉碎了阶级敌人破坏生产的阴谋，使全厂生产很快走上正轨。
    当好学生，不当“裁判”
    要当好“参谋”，首先要有甘当小学生的精神，虚心地向革委会成员学习，向广大革命职工学习，绝不能指手划脚，充当“裁判”。
    这个厂清理阶级队伍以来，有的车间和班组一度只热衷于揪出坏人，忽视了革命大批判。怎样才能作到以革命大批判为动力，深入地开展对敌斗争呢？革委会一时拿不出好办法。毛泽东思想宣传队一方面建议革委会成员深入调查研究，同时自己也深入三车间，和群众一起研究总结怎样把革命大批判和清理阶级队伍结合起来的问题。毛泽东思想宣传队发现，三车间的群众以班组作为革命大批判的基点，利用休息时间开批判会，把揭露阶级敌人的罪恶同批判中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义谬论结合起来，作到了“以批带查（敌人），以查促批，批查结合”，因而充分发动了群众，收到了很好的效果。在毛泽东思想宣传队的建议下，革委会在三车间召开了现场会，进一步促进了全厂革命大批判和清理阶级队伍的工作深入、广泛地发展起来。
    当革委会在一些原则问题上产生分歧时，毛泽东思想宣传队从不以“裁判”身份出现，评张说李，而是要革委会把矛盾交给群众，用走群众路线的方法去解决。这样，既帮助革委会在毛泽东思想的基础上统一了思想，统一了行动，又帮助革委会进一步密切了和群众的联系。革委会成立不久，毛泽东思想宣传队建议革委会开门整风，让革命群众帮助革委会成员整掉旧思想、旧作风，树立新思想、新作风。广大革命群众对革委会某些成员脱离生产劳动、高高在上的官僚主义作风提出了诚恳而又尖锐的批评，使革委会成员受到很大教育。从此以后，革委会的所有成员都积极地参加了生产劳动。革委会还经常召开新老工人座谈会，把革委会置于群众的监督之下。
　　当好捍卫者，不做“观察员”
    只当“参谋”，不当“司令”，是不是就事事都处在第二线呢？不是。这个厂的毛泽东思想宣传队在大是大非的问题上，挺身而出，旗帜鲜明，毫不含糊地捍卫革命委员会，决不把自己当成“观察员”。
    工厂建立革命委员会不久，一小撮阶级敌人不甘心于死亡，煽起了一股无政府主义妖风，破坏生产，向新生的革命政权施加压力，妄图搞垮革委会。有的工人看穿了阶级敌人的阴谋诡计，写出“坚持八小时生产，业余闹革命”的大字报，对无政府主义思潮进行反击。革委会支持了工人群众的要求，开展了大反无政府主义的斗争，全厂革命群众很快发动起来。这时，一小撮阶级敌人又施展了新的花招，散布什么：这是整群众，是新的资产阶级反动路线，等等。革委会有的成员一时分辨不清是非，正当他们对是否继续大反无政府主义犹豫不定的时候，毛泽东思想宣传队立即在革委会明确表示态度，坚决支持革命委员会领导全体革命职工，大反无政府主义。并且明确指出，在这场斗争中，一定要狠抓阶级斗争，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，坚决粉碎阶级敌人的一切阴谋诡计。在毛泽东思想宣传队的支持下，全厂很快就取得了反无政府主义的胜利，进一步巩固了劳动纪律，保证了革命、生产和工作的顺利进行。
    毛主席说：“必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道，这是无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的一个关键问题。”今年一月，毛泽东思想宣传队发现有的革命群众组织积极筹备庆祝该组织在一月革命风暴中夺权一周年的活动，而这个组织的负责人中，有的已当选为革委会副主任或是革委会委员。毛泽东思想宣传队认为，这样的活动不利于巩固革命的大联合和三结合，只会使资产阶级派性死灰复燃。他们立即把这个组织的各级负责人请来，同他们谈心，告诉他们为什么不能搞这样的活动。他们接受了毛泽东思想宣传队的劝告，表示今后一定要事事、处处严格要求自己，为毛泽东思想掌好权，绝不搞资产阶级派性活动。
    由于驻这个厂的解放军毛泽东思想宣传队较好地摆正了同革委会的关系，这个厂的革命委员会，在阶级斗争和生产斗争中建立了很高的威信，成为全厂革命职工坚强有力的战斗指挥部，革命和生产搞得越来越好。今年四月份以来，全厂生产总产值，连续三个月超过了一九六六年同期水平。
