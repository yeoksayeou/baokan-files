In the strong leadership of the revolutionary committees (or revolutionary preparatory committees) at various levels and with the great support of the People's Liberation Army, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and rural grassroots cadres have powerfully struck and smashed the evil plots of a handful of class enemies who attempted to sabotage the revolution and production, overcome natural disasters, and achieved double victories in revolution and production.

Xinhua News Agency, August 18th: Under the encouragement and impetus of the great situation of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, following the bumper harvest of summer grain crops this year, China's early rice has also been harvested in abundance. This is another brilliant victory for the hundreds of millions of poor and lower-middle peasants and rural revolutionary cadres in China who resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," and is another clear sign that the situation in China's rural areas is getting better and better.

"Look at the waves of rice and millet, heroes return home at dusk." After the intense labor of July, now, the vast early rice producing areas of the Five Ridges, the Yangtze River, and the southeastern coast of China, the early rice has generally been harvested. Messages from various places indicate that the main early rice producing areas of Guangdong, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Shanghai have all had bumper harvests, and many communes and production brigades have emerged with significant increases in production. Some areas, which suffered from droughts and floods during the early rice growing period this year, have, due to the organization of the local masses to bravely and tenaciously fight against natural disasters, still achieved good harvests.

Throughout the entire production period of China's early rice this year, from sowing to harvesting, it was a critical period for China to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Hundreds of millions of poor and lower-middle peasants and rural revolutionary cadres, under the encouragement and impetus of the great situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution advancing forward, followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment with unprecedented enthusiasm, grasped the revolution firmly, and promoted production vigorously. The great leader Chairman Mao pointed out profoundly: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a political revolution under the conditions of socialism, where the proletariat opposes the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the revolutionary masses it leads and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in various places, following the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, have highly carried forward the spirit of continuous and thorough revolution, actively launched fierce attacks on the class enemies, powerfully struck and smashed the evil plots of a handful of class enemies who attempted to sabotage the revolution and production. At the same time, various places have vigorously opened various forms of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, studied and implemented Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, further deepened the revolutionary criticism, further purged the counter-revolutionary revisionism spread by China's Khrushchev and his agents in various places, and firmly established the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. After the broad masses of commune members and cadres have been tempered and tested through the struggles of the two classes and two lines, their class struggle consciousness and consciousness of the struggle between the two lines have been further heightened, and their socialist enthusiasm has soared to unprecedented heights. In this way, the various field management tasks of this year's early rice production, from seedling raising, transplanting to fertilizing, pest control, and weeding, have all been carried out better than in previous years, laying a solid foundation and creating good conditions for a bumper harvest.

The successive establishment of revolutionary committees at various levels and the great support of the People's Liberation Army's agricultural support troops have strengthened the leadership of the revolution and production, playing a very significant role in achieving this year's early rice bumper harvest. Some early rice producing areas in China this year have experienced droughts, low temperatures, and other unfavorable conditions; some early rice producing areas have also been affected by floods. However, under the strong leadership of the revolutionary committees (or revolutionary preparatory committees) at various levels and the great support of the People's Liberation Army, the peasant masses and revolutionary cadres in various places, with the revolutionary heroism of fearing neither heaven nor earth, have tenaciously fought against natural disasters, "determined to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory." In some areas of Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, and Anhui provinces, due to droughts and low temperatures, the seedling raising time was delayed. The commune members in these areas, under the leadership of the revolutionary committees at various levels, actively launched the mass movement of "learning from Dazhai in agriculture," carried forward the revolutionary spirit of Dazhai people daring to struggle and daring to win, relied on the collective strength and wisdom, used methods such as strengthening seedling field management, saving water, and advancing water diversion and field leveling to overcome the difficulties caused by droughts and low temperatures, and completed the transplanting task of early rice on time. In some riverine areas of Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangxi, and Hunan provinces, the early rice fields were invaded by floods during the grain filling and grain setting period. The local masses, with the great support of the People's Liberation Army, used the boundless enthusiasm unleashed in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and applied it to production, fighting day and night against the floods. Many areas, despite the severe invasion and disruption of floods, still ensured the overall increase in early rice production.

		Jiangxi Province Xingguo County Changgang Commune Changgang Production Brigade's broad masses of commune members, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, grasped the revolution firmly, promoted production vigorously. While carrying out revolutionary criticism, they worked hard in production, overcame water disasters, and achieved a bumper harvest of early rice. The commune members, with deep proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, said: "Harvest thinking of Chairman Mao, selling more surplus grain to show loyalty." This is the commune members joyfully delivering the grain to the state.

    亿万贫下中农和农村革命干部坚决执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针
    我国农村形势越来越好今年早稻又获丰收
    在各级革委会（或革筹小组）的坚强领导和解放军的大力支援下，广大贫下中农和农村基层干部有力地打击和粉碎了一小撮阶级敌人妄图破坏革命和生产的罪恶阴谋，战胜了自然灾害，夺得了革命生产双胜利
    新华社十八日讯　在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的大好形势鼓舞和推动下，继今年夏收粮食作物丰收之后，我国早稻又获得了丰收。这是我国亿万贫下中农和农村革命干部坚决执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针的又一辉煌胜利，是我国农村形势越来越好的又一鲜明标志。
      “喜看稻菽千重浪，遍地英雄下夕烟。”经过七月以来的紧张劳动，现在，我国五岭南北、长江两岸和东南沿海的广大早稻产区，早稻一般都已收割完毕。来自各地的消息表明，早稻主要产区广东、江西、浙江、湖南、湖北、安徽、江苏和上海等省、市普遍丰收，还涌现出一批显著增产的社、队。有些地区，今年在早稻生长时期受到旱涝等自然灾害的侵袭，由于当地群众组织起来向自然灾害展开了英勇顽强的斗争，仍然夺得了较好收成。
    今年我国早稻从播种到收获的整个生产期间，正是我国无产阶级文化大革命夺取全面胜利的关键时期。亿万贫下中农和农村革命干部，在无产阶级文化大革命的洪流滚滚向前的大好形势的鼓舞和推动下，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，以空前未有的热情，狠抓革命，猛促生产。伟大领袖毛主席极其深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”各地广大贫下中农和革命干部遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，高度发扬不断革命、彻底革命的精神，主动地向阶级敌人发起猛烈的进攻，有力地打击和粉碎了一小撮阶级敌人妄图破坏革命和生产的罪恶阴谋。在此同时，各地还大力开办各种形式的毛泽东思想学习班，学习和落实毛主席一系列的最新指示，更加深入地开展革命大批判，进一步肃清中国赫鲁晓夫及其在各地代理人所散布的反革命修正主义，大立战无不胜的毛泽东思想。广大社员和干部经过两个阶级和两条路线斗争的考验和锻炼，阶级斗争觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟得到更进一步的提高，社会主义积极性空前高涨。这样，就使今年早稻生产从育秧、栽插到追肥、治虫、除草等田间管理各项工作，都进行得比往年好，为丰收打下了坚实的基础和创造了良好的条件。
    各地各级革命委员会的相继建立，人民解放军支农部队的大力支援，使革命和生产的领导更为加强，对夺取今年早稻丰收起了极为重大的作用。今年我国有些早稻产区，曾出现干旱、低温等不利情况；还有一些早稻产区，曾发生洪水侵袭和干扰。但是，在各地各级革命委员会
  （或革筹小组）的坚强领导和人民解放军的大力支援下，各地农民群众和革命干部，以天不怕、地不怕的革命英雄主义气概，同自然灾害展开顽强搏斗，“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”江西、湖南、湖北、四川、安徽等省有一部分地区，因干旱和低温推迟了育秧时间。这些地区的社员在各级革命委员会的领导下，积极开展“农业学大寨”的群众运动，发扬大寨人敢于斗争、敢于胜利的革命精神，依靠集体的力量和智慧，用加强秧田管理、节约用水和提前引水整田等办法，战胜干旱、低温造成的困难，使早稻适时完成栽插任务。广东、福建、江西、湖南等省有些沿江河地区的早稻田，正当早稻灌浆、结粒期间，遇到了洪水侵袭。当地群众在人民解放军的大力支援下，把在文化大革命中焕发出来的冲天干劲用到生产中去，夜以继日地同洪水搏斗。很多地区在洪水的严重侵袭和干扰下，仍然保证了早稻的全面增产。
