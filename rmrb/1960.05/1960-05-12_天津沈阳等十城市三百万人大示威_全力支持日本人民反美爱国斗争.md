Tianjin, Shenyang, and Ten Other Cities Hold Massive Demonstrations with Three Million People
    Fully Support the Japanese People's Anti-American Patriotic Struggle
    (Our Newspaper News) Following the unprecedented demonstration and rally of over one million people from all walks of life in the capital on May 9th, on May 10th and 11th, nearly three million people in ten cities, including Tianjin, Shenyang, Xi'an, Changchun, Lüda, Chengdu, Nanchang, Jinan, Yinchuan, and Lhasa, held massive demonstrations and rallies, resolutely supporting the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.
    In Tianjin, 800,000 people participated in rallies held simultaneously in various districts. People warned the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries: Those who play with fire will perish by it!
    Thirty-five thousand people from all walks of life in Jilin Province and Changchun City participated in the Changchun City rally. Fifteen years ago, Japanese imperialism carried out cruel exploitation and enslavement of the people of Northeast China. The masses participating in the rally vividly remembered the heinous crimes of the Japanese fascists. They angrily shouted: Oppose the revival of Japanese militarism! Down with U.S. imperialism!
    Lüda City, which suffered forty years of enslavement by Japanese militarism, held a demonstration and rally with 160,000 people in the rain. They expressed deep sympathy for the current situation of the Japanese people and firm support for the anti-American patriotic struggle they are carrying out today.
    Twenty thousand people from Sichuan Province and Chengdu City gathered to pay tribute to the heroic Japanese people. Representatives from all walks of life unanimously stated in their speeches that they would stand with the Japanese people and resolutely support the Japanese people's struggle to the end.
    People from all walks of life in Lhasa City came out in full force, with 30,000 people gathering at the Lhasa Stadium for a grand rally. People of Tibetan, Han, and other ethnic groups resolutely opposed the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries' conspiracy to plot a new war and firmly supported the just struggle of the Japanese people. (Detailed reports of demonstrations and rallies in the above five cities have been published on page 5 of yesterday's newspaper)
    On the 10th and 11th, Shenyang with 700,000 people, Xi'an with 250,000 people, Jinan with 300,000 people, Nanchang with 120,000 people, and Yinchuan with over 40,000 people also held demonstrations and rallies respectively to support the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic struggle. The following are reports of demonstrations and rallies in these five cities.

    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 11th - In Shenyang, a city that suffered fourteen years of bloody rule by Japanese militarism after the "September 18th" Incident, 700,000 people braved the rain today to hold an unprecedented rally and demonstration, resolutely supporting the just struggle of the Japanese people against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, and resolutely opposing the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries' sinister conspiracy to plot a new war.
    At noon, groups of workers, farmers, officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, members of urban people's communes, students, and fully armed militiamen converged from all directions on the wide road from the People's Stadium to Zhongshan Square. People vividly remembered the heinous crimes of Japanese militarism in Shenyang fifteen years ago. At the site where the Japanese militarists created the "Liutiao Lake Incident," people inscribed the words "Aggressors are bound to perish" on a model of a cannon shell commemorating the "September 18th" Incident by the former Japanese invaders. Residents of "Liutiao Lake" and "Beidaying" came to participate in the rally and demonstration today, regardless of age or gender. People raised their arms in the rain and shouted: "Oppose the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty!" "Oppose the revival of Japanese militarism!" and other slogans.
    Li Huang, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Che Xiangchen and Wang Zimu, Vice Governors of Liaoning Province, Jiao Ruoyu, First Secretary of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and other provincial and municipal party and government leaders, as well as heads of various people's organizations and democratic parties, participated in the Shenyang City People's Support Japan People Anti-US Military Alliance Treaty Rally.
    Yamasaki Shunichi, Secretary-General of the Japan General Council of Trade Unions Delegation to China, and three others, as well as Singaporean guests visiting Shenyang, also attended the meeting. Soviet experts in Shenyang and students from the Soviet Union, North Korea, Vietnam, and other countries also participated in the conference.
    Jiao Ruoyu, Standing Committee Member of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and First Secretary of the Shenyang Municipal Committee, spoke first at the meeting. He said: "The heroic struggle of the Japanese people against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty has thoroughly exposed and isolated the Kishi Nobusuke reactionary group, powerfully disrupted the steps taken by the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries to prepare for a new war, disrupted the timetable of the Kishi Nobusuke reactionary faction attempting to force the Japanese Diet to pass the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, and made important contributions to defending Asian and world peace." He expressed great concern and firm support on behalf of the people of Shenyang to the increasingly high tide of the Japanese people's just struggle, and wished the Japanese people even more brilliant victories in the sixteenth national unified action struggle.
    Jiao Ruoyu said: "The conclusion of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty is a serious threat to all peace-loving countries and people in Asia and the world, and it is the beginning of all new disasters for the Japanese people. Because of this, the Japanese people can only avoid being dragged onto the road of war, death, and disaster by resolutely smashing the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty."
    Jiao Ruoyu pointed out that Japanese militarism had caused enormous sacrifices and disasters to the Chinese people. He said: "The Chinese people will never forget the brutal atrocities of Japanese militarism, especially the people of Shenyang City, who remember more clearly that the first cannonball of Japanese militarism's aggression against China in 1931 was fired at Shenyang. From then on, our lovely hometown became a hell on earth under the rule of Japanese militarism, causing countless of our people to experience fourteen years of tragic slave life." At this time, the anger of the masses participating in the conference burned, and their emotions were excited. They raised their fists and angrily shouted: "Oppose the revival of Japanese militarism!" "U.S. imperialism get out of Japan! Get out of our Taiwan!"
    Jiao Ruoyu reminded everyone: The U.S. and Japanese reactionaries are colluding with each other, dreaming of retracing the old road of aggression, and attempting to re-oppress and enslave our people. He resolutely said: "We will never allow Japanese militarism to revive, and we will never let the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries' conspiracy succeed!" He said: "Now a strong socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union has stood tall in the world, and socialist China has the strength to crush aggression. If U.S. imperialism and Japanese militarism dare to attack us, they will surely be crushed to pieces." As soon as he finished speaking, the slogan "The people of China and Japan unite! Down with U.S. imperialism!" resounded throughout the audience.
    Ning Wu, Chairman of the Liaoning Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, then spoke at the meeting. He said: "We have always regarded the Japanese people's struggle for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality as our own struggle, and the Japanese people's victory as our own victory." He also expressed his deep belief that as long as the Japanese people strengthen their unity, persist in their struggle, and with the support of peace-loving people all over the world, and with the support of 650 million Chinese people, the struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty will surely achieve final victory.
    The masses at the meeting welcomed Yamasaki Shunichi, Secretary-General of the Japan General Council of Trade Unions Delegation to China, to speak with warm applause. In his speech, he thanked the people of Shenyang for their support of the Japanese people's patriotic struggle and congratulated the unity between the Chinese and Japanese peoples. He said: "The Japanese working class has the firm determination to wage a resolute struggle against the enemy." He also said: "If Nobusuke Kishi ignores the Japanese people's desire for peace and forcibly passes this U.S.-Japan 'security treaty' in the Diet, then Nobusuke Kishi himself will be digging his own grave and will inevitably suffer the same fate as Syngman Rhee." His speech aroused lasting applause from the audience.
    Heads of various people's organizations and democratic parties in Liaoning Province and Shenyang City, as well as representatives from all walks of life, spoke at the meeting one after another. They unanimously expressed their determination to stand with the Japanese people, oppose the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, oppose the U.S. imperialist aggression conspiracy, and oppose the revival of Japanese militarism until final victory is achieved. Their speeches were often interrupted by the impassioned slogans of the entire audience.
    The conference passed a telegram to the Japanese people.
    After the conference, 700,000 people in the rally marched in several dozen routes. People marched on the streets of the city with large banners and huge cartoons, and they kept shouting slogans. The demonstration continued until dusk.

    10日和11日，沈阳七十万人、西安二十五万人、济南三十万人、南昌十二万人和银川四万多人也分别举行了示威和集会，支持日本人民反美爱国斗争。下面发表的是这五个城市示威和集会的报道。
    新华社沈阳11日电　在“九·一八”后曾经饱受日本军国主义十四年血腥统治的沈阳市，今天有七十万人冒雨举行空前规模的集会和示威，坚决支援日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的正义斗争，并且坚决反对美日反动派策划新战争的罪恶阴谋。
    中午，成群结队的工人、农民、解放军官兵、城市人民公社社员、学生和全副武装的民兵，冒着雨从四面八方汇集到人民体育场至中山广场的宽敞马路上。人们对十五年前日本军国主义在沈阳的滔天罪行记忆犹新。当年日本军国主义制造“柳条沟事件”的地方，人们在以前日本侵略者纪念“九·一八”的一具炮弹模型上刻上了“侵略者必取灭亡”的字样。“柳条沟”和“北大营”一带的居民，今天不论男女老少都前来参加了集会和示威游行。人们在雨中振臂高呼：“反对日美军事同盟条约！”“反对复活日本军国主义！”等口号。
    参加沈阳市各界人民支援日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约大会的，有中共辽宁省委书记处书记李荒，辽宁省副省长车向忱、王梓木和中共沈阳市委第一书记焦若愚等省、市党和政府领导人以及各人民团体、各民主党派的负责人。
    日本工会总评议会访华代表团事务局长山崎俊一等三人和在沈阳参观的新加坡外宾也出席了大会。参加大会的还有在沈阳的苏联专家和苏联、朝鲜、越南等国留学生。
    中共辽宁省常委、沈阳市委第一书记焦若愚在会上首先讲话。他说：“日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的英勇斗争，彻底地揭露了和孤立了岸信介反动集团，有力地打乱了日美反动派准备新战争的步骤，打乱了岸信介反动派企图迫使日本国会通过日美军事同盟条约的时间表，为保卫亚洲和世界和平作出了重要的贡献”。他代表沈阳市人民对日本人民越来越高涨的正义斗争，表示极大的关怀和坚决的支持，并且预祝日本人民在第十六次全国统一行动斗争中取得更加辉煌的胜利。
    焦若愚说：“日美军事同盟条约的缔结，对于亚洲和全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民是严重的威胁，对于日本人民是一切新的灾难的开始。正因为这样，日本人民只有坚决粉碎日美军事同盟条约，才能避免被拖上战争、死亡、灾难的道路。”
    焦若愚指出，日本军国主义曾经使中国人民遭受了巨大的牺牲和灾难。他说：“中国人民永远也不会忘记日本军国主义的残酷暴行，特别是沈阳市人民，更清楚地记得，日本军国主义在1931年侵略中国的第一颗炮弹就打在沈阳，从此，我们可爱的家乡变成了日本军国主义统治下的人间地狱，使我们的无数人民经历了十四年悲惨的奴隶生活。”这时，参加大会的群众怒火燃烧，情绪激动，他们高举拳头愤怒高呼：“反对复活日本军国主义！”“美帝国主义从日本滚出去！从我国台湾滚出去！”
    焦若愚提醒大家：美日反动派互相勾结，梦想重走以前的侵略老路，企图重新压迫和奴役我国人民。他坚决地说：“我们绝不允许日本军国主义复活，绝不让美日反动派的阴谋得逞！”他说：“现在世界上已经屹立着一个以苏联为首的强大的社会主义阵营，社会主义的中国有着足以粉碎侵略的力量。如果美帝国主义和日本军国主义胆敢向我们进攻，他们一定要碰得头破血流。”他的话音刚落，“中日两国人民团结起来！打倒美帝国主义！”的口号声就震撼全场。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会辽宁分会主席宁武接着在会上讲话，他说：“我们一向把日本人民争取独立、民主、和平、中立的斗争看作是自己的斗争，把日本人民的胜利，看作是自己的胜利。”他还表示深信，只要日本人民加强团结，坚持斗争，在全世界爱好和平人民的支持下，在六亿五千万中国人民的支持下，反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争就一定能取得最后胜利。
    集会群众以热烈掌声欢迎日本工会总评议会访华代表团事务局长山崎俊一讲话。他在讲话中感谢沈阳市人民对日本人民爱国斗争的支持，并且为中日两国人民的团结祝贺。他说：“日本工人阶级有坚强的决心与敌人进行坚决斗争。”他还说：“如果岸信介忽视日本人民对和平的愿望，而在国会中强行通过这个日美‘安全条约’的话，就是岸信介自己为自己掘坟墓，就必将遭到和李承晚一样的命运。”他的讲话激起了全场经久不息的掌声。
    辽宁省、沈阳市各人民团体、各民主党派负责人以及各界人民代表相继在会上讲话。他们一致表示坚决同日本人民站在一起，反对日美军事同盟条约，反对美帝国主义的侵略阴谋，反对复活日本军国主义，直到取得最后胜利。他们的讲话不时被全场的激昂口号声所打断。
    大会通过致日本人民的通电。
    大会结束以后，七十万集会群众分几十路进行示威游行。人们拿着大字标语和巨幅漫画行进在全市的各个街道，人们还不断高呼口号，示威游行直到傍晚还在进行。
