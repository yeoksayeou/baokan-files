    Revolutionary Flowers Bloom Red Across the City (Pingtan)
    Adapted and performed by the Shanghai Delegation Drama Team.

    [Recitation] In the first spring of the 1960s,
    The sparks of revolution spread red throughout the world.
    Spring thunder rumbles on the Huangpu River,
    Vast waves and magnificent scenes are everywhere.

    [Chorus] Magnificent Shanghai City,
    Soaring enthusiasm to make revolution,
    We are defenders of the General Line,
    We are heroes and vanguards of socialist
      construction,
    In order to rapidly change the old face
      of poverty and blankness,
    We must advance at high speed, seizing every
      second.

    [Recitation] Worker brothers rely on a soaring
    enthusiasm,
    Rely on a heart of fiery red,
    Rise up to make a great technical revolution,
    Even if empty-handed,
    We must achieve immediate success and win
      victory.
    Look!
    The Shanghai Zhicheng Xing Steel Products Factory relies on
    (First singer) A kitchen knife to make a revolution.

    Zhicheng Xing started from scratch,
    No matter how great the difficulties, (All white) We'll overcome them!
    (First singer) Attack the key and find the trick,
    Came up with a native method, (All white) Good!
    (First singer) Where there is a will, there is a way,
    A native crane has been built. (All white) Effective! Effective! Effective!
    (Sing) This first shot encourages us to move forward again.

    (First white) This native crane has only undergone a short
      few months and has completed its historical task, becoming an exhibit.

    (All white) Why?
    (First, all sing) Our foreign crane is built,
    Flying dragons and dancing phoenixes soar in the sky, now
    The carrying pole and ropes are all discarded, the
    thousand-pound steel plate is as light as a goose
    feather, and the workshop no longer hears the heave-ho,
    heave-ho, heave-ho sound, but only hears the electric bell,
    ding-a-ling, ding-a-ling, ding-a-ling, the
    red flag of the General Line is raised high, continue to leap
    forward, constantly revolutionize, and march towards complete electrification.

    (First white) Zhicheng Xing is a banner of starting from scratch and making a great technical
  revolution, which factory can catch up?
    (Second white) Yes, here it comes!
    (Second sing) We are the Linhua Strip Steel Factory, building
    socialism requires comparison, learning, catching up, and helping.
    Our slogan is loud and clear,
    (All white) Make a revolution every seven days!
    (Second sing) Confidence is stronger than steel, realize mechanization,
    Change the old look, create miracles and put
    manual operation out of business.
    (Chorus) Out of business.
    (All white) Are there any difficulties?
    (Second sing) Difficulties can't scare heroes,
    Our workers have strength, have strength.
    The workshop machines are rumbling, the
    red flag of revolution is flying in the wind.

    (Recitation) Wave after wave, waves ten thousand feet high,
    The Zhabei Strip Steel Factory comes from behind.
    (Chorus) Learn from Linhua, catch up with Linhua, surpass Linhua,
    The spring breeze blows out a garden of flowers.

    (Third sing) We must learn from the advanced and set lofty aspirations,
    Want to compete with the advanced,
    Fight hard day and night,
    Overcome the crane difficulty first,
    Everyone's confidence is further increased,
    Realized...
    (Chorus) Realized coal adding automation, steel rolling automation,
    Coming from behind and surpassing Linhua,
    Spring city is full of flying flowers,
    Spring flowers bloom in the morning glow.

    (Recitation) Worker brothers have shown soaring enthusiasm in the technical revolution,
    But the sisters' enthusiasm is also very amazing.
    The Huasheng Box Factory, with 70 percent of the workers being women,
    Fought hard for three days to make a revolution.

    (Fourth Chorus) Empty-handed to make revolution, make revolution.
    Throw away the bowls and brushes, manual operation must
    be liberated, be liberated, the millennia old tiles must be turned
    over.
    (Fourth sing) Set lofty aspirations, establish ambitions,
    Want to quickly catch up with Zhicheng Xing,
    Building socialism,
    (Chorus) No distinction between men and women,
    (Fourth sing) Implement the General Line,
    (Chorus) Everyone has a responsibility,
    (Fourth sing) With one heart and one mind to create miracles,
    Fight hard for three days to make a revolution,
    Realize mechanization empty-handed,
    The song of victory sings and sings non-stop.

    (Chorus) The song of victory sings non-stop.
    (Recitation) The song of victory is exciting,
    The technical revolution has become a national movement, these
    miracles are emerging because the spirit of the General Line
    illuminates our hearts.
    (Chorus) Our hearts, forever towards the sun,
    Our eyes, forever towards the front,
    Forward, forward, forward,
    Advance at high speed, advance at high speed.
    Plant the red flag on the highest peak of science and culture,
      the highest peak,
    For the 1960s, write...
    A brilliant and glorious new chapter.
