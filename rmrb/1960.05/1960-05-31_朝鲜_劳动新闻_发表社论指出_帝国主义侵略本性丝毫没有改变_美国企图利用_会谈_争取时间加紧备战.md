    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 29th. The Korean "Labor News" published an editorial today entitled "The Wolf Will Not Turn into a Sheep," pointing out that the U.S. imperialists' sinful actions of deliberately undermining the Four-Power Summit fully exposed their robber-like aggressive nature and their true face as a ferocious enemy of human peace before the people of the world.

    This event once again clearly proves that the nature of imperialism, whether in the past or now, has not changed at all.

    The editorial said: "The Korean people have directly experienced the aggressive nature of imperialism through a long history. The Korean people have suffered the pain of 36 years of Japanese colonial rule and have experienced that no matter what sign imperialism hangs out, its essence remains unchanged." The editorial then pointed out that all the facts after the U.S. imperialists replaced the Japanese imperialists and forcibly occupied South Korea can only illustrate that the aggressive nature of imperialism is the same.

    Imperialism is the source of war
    The editorial emphasized that imperialism is the source of war. "Whether it is the U.S. imperialists' robber-like behavior of answering the repeated proposals of our Republic's government for peaceful reunification of Korea by launching a barbaric war of aggression, or carrying out treacherous acts of aggression against the Soviet Union behind the scenes before the summit, there is no difference in essence." "All facts show that U.S. imperialism is the most shameless and most brutal aggressor."

    The editorial said that the imperialist's kept scholars, right-wing social democrats, and the modern revisionists of Yugoslavia, etc., the lackeys of imperialism, in order to "prove" that the nature of imperialism seems to have changed, and that imperialism no longer seems to be keen on war and aggression, they have carried out all kinds of sophistry. However, this incident of the U.S. spy plane invading Soviet airspace once again proved that no matter how they embellish it, imperialism is still imperialism in the end.

    Eisenhower is the ringleader of the aggressors
    The editorial said that Eisenhower sometimes disguised himself as a "defender of peace," but he himself confessed to the crime of instructing spy planes to invade Soviet airspace, and claimed that this was U.S. national policy, thus proving once again that he was, is, and will continue to be the most ferocious enemy of mankind and the ringleader of aggressors.

    The editorial said that there is no watershed change in the U.S. imperialist's policy of aggression and its robber-like acts of aggression. If there is any difference, it is only that the form is sometimes more open and sometimes more concealed.

    The editorial pointed out that in order to deceive the people, cover up its aggressive nature, buy time to step up arms expansion and war preparations, and look for opportunities to carry out aggressive actions, the U.S. imperialists engage in empty talk about "peace" and use "talks." They attempt to use this to recover their bankrupt military superiority and "position of strength policy," and to paralyze the increasingly high and large-scale anti-imperialist struggles of the people of colonial and semi-colonial countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and the struggle of the people of the world to defend peace.

    Peace can only be won through struggle
    The editorial emphasized that there must be no illusions about imperialism. "A wolf will never turn into a sheep." U.S. imperialism was, and still is, the ferocious enemy of the Korean people.

    The editorial said, "Through our own life experiences, we deeply understand that we cannot beg for peace, independence, and freedom from the imperialists. All of this can only be won through struggle."

    The editorial emphasized that it was only because the Korean people, with the unanimous support of the people of socialist countries and peace-loving people all over the world, carried out three years of heroic resistance war, and made unremitting efforts to consolidate peace after the war, that it was possible to sign the armistice agreement in Korea, and to continue to maintain the armistice. The editorial said, "In the future, in order to maintain peace in Korea and promote the peaceful settlement of the Korean question, it is not enough to rely on 'begging' or 'trusting' the enemy. The Korean people can only further strengthen the unbreakable unity with the socialist countries, maintain a high degree of vigilance, expose and crush all the enemy's conspiracies, strengthen preparedness, deal with any unexpected attacks, prevent the U.S. imperialists from daring to provoke war, and continue to carry out a tenacious struggle to make them withdraw from South Korea.

    Drive the American aggressors out of all places
    The editorial said: "As pointed out in the Declaration of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries in 1957: 'At present, the forces of peace have grown greatly and it is practically possible to prevent war.' However, this declaration also warned that as long as imperialism exists, there will be soil for aggressive war, 'The people of all countries must maintain the greatest vigilance against the danger of war caused by imperialism.' This is the situation, and historical experience proves that no class will automatically withdraw from the stage of history."

    The editorial concluded, "The oppressed people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America and the peace-loving people of the world must unite as one, and must drive the U.S. imperialist aggressors out of all places, and tie up their hands and feet in preparing for war."

### 朝鲜“劳动新闻”发表社论指出  帝国主义侵略本性丝毫没有改变  美国企图利用“会谈”争取时间加紧备战

    朝鲜“劳动新闻”发表社论指出
    帝国主义侵略本性丝毫没有改变
    美国企图利用“会谈”争取时间加紧备战
    新华社平壤29日电　朝鲜“劳动新闻”今天发表题为“狼不会变成羊”的社论指出，美帝国主义有计划地破坏四国首脑会议的罪恶行动，在全世界人民面前充分地暴露了它的强盗般的侵略本性和它作为人类和平的凶恶敌人的真面目。
    这一事件又一次清楚地证明，帝国主义的本性不论在过去或者现在，都丝毫也没有改变。
    社论说：“朝鲜人民通过长久的历史直接体验到了帝国主义的侵略本性。朝鲜人民经受了三十六年的日本殖民统治的痛苦，体验到帝国主义不论挂出什么招牌，其本质是不变的。”社论接着指出，美帝国主义者代替日本帝国主义者强占南朝鲜后的一切事实也只能说明帝国主义的侵略本性是一样的。
    帝国主义是战争的根源
    社论强调指出，帝国主义是战争的根源。“无论是美帝国主义者从挑起野蛮的侵略战争来回答了我们共和国政府一再提出的和平统一朝鲜的建议的强盗行为，还是在首脑会议以前，在背后进行反对苏联的背信弃义的侵略行为，在本质上没有丝毫区别。”“一切事实都说明，美帝国主义是最厚颜无耻的、最残暴的侵略者。”
    社论说，帝国主义的御用学者，右翼社会民主党和南斯拉夫的现代修正主义者等帝国主义的奴才，为了“证明”帝国主义的性质似乎有了变化，帝国主义似乎不再热衷于战争和侵略，他们进行了形形式式的诡辩。但是，这次美国间谍飞机侵犯苏联领空事件又一次证明了，无论它们怎样粉饰，帝国主义到头来还是帝国主义。
  艾森豪威尔是侵略者的头目
    社论说，艾森豪威尔有时把自己打扮成“和平的保卫者”，但他自己招认了他指使间谍飞机侵犯苏联领空的罪行，并声称这是美国的国策，从而又一次证明了他过去是，现在是，今后仍然是人类最凶恶的敌人和侵略者的头目。
    社论说，在美帝国主义的侵略政策和它的强盗般的侵略行为中并没有什么发生变化的分水岭。如果说有什么区别，只不过是在形式上有时公开一些，有时隐蔽一些而已。
    社论指出，美帝国主义者为了欺骗人民，掩盖它的侵略本质，争取时间加紧扩军备战，窥测机会进行侵略行动而空谈“和平”，利用“会谈”。它们企图以此来挽回破产了的军事优势和“实力地位政策”，并麻痹亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的殖民地、半殖民地国家人民掀起的日益高涨的、规模巨大的反对帝国主义的斗争和全世界人民保卫和平的斗争。
            只有通过斗争才能争取和平
    社论强调说，对帝国主义决不能有任何幻想。“狼决不会变成羊”。美帝国主义过去是，现在仍然是朝鲜人民的凶恶敌人。
    社论说，“我们通过我们自己的生活经验，深深体会到不能向帝国主义者乞求和平、独立和自由。只有通过斗争才能争取到这一切。”
    社论强调指出，只是由于朝鲜人民在社会主义阵营国家人民和全世界爱好和平人民的一致支持下，进行了三年的英勇抗战，和在战后为巩固和平进行不屈不挠的努力，才有可能在朝鲜签订了停战协定，并能够继续维持停战。社论说，“今后为了在朝鲜维护和平和促进朝鲜问题的和平解决。依靠向敌人‘乞求’或‘信托’是不行的。朝鲜人民只有进一步加强同社会主义阵营国家的牢不可破的团结，保持高度的警惕性，揭露和粉碎敌人的一切阴谋，加强戒备，对付任何意外的攻击，使美帝国主义者不敢挑起战争，并为使它从南朝鲜撤退而继续进行顽强的斗争。
            把美国侵略者从各地赶出去
    社论说：“正如1957年社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言中指出的一样：‘目前和平的力量已经大大成长，已经有实际可能来防止战争。’但是，这个宣言又警告说，只要帝国主义还存在，就有发生侵略战争的土壤，‘世界各国人民对于帝国主义所造成的战争危险，必须保持最大的警惕。’局势就是这样的，历史经验证明，没有任何一个阶级会自动地退出历史舞台。”
    社论最后说，“亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国被压迫人民和全世界爱好和平的人民一致团结起来，一定要把美帝国主义侵略者从各地赶出去，并束缚住它准备战争的手脚。”
