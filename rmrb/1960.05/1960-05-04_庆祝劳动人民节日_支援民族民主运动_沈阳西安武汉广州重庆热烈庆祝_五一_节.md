In their speeches, they also analyzed the current international and domestic situation, pointing out that the current international situation is one of rapid development of socialist forces, national independence movements, and other peace-loving forces, and that the struggle against imperialism is surging. They also expressed their firm support for the national democratic struggles in South Korea, Japan, Indochina, Turkey, and the countries of the African continent and Latin America, which are in full swing.

After the gatherings at various locations, the masses divided into dozens of teams for parades. The workers and members of the urban people's communes participating in the parade held charts showing the great leap forward in production and models of various new products. The charts held by the workers showed that the total industrial output value of Shenyang City by April 29th had completed 105% of the April plan, an increase of 11.6% over the same period last year. Leading the parade of the Red Flag People's Commune were the workers of the Seventh Comprehensive Factory of this commune. This factory was still a production group composed of only eleven housewives in 1958, but now has 460 workers. The workers of this factory constantly raised their arms and shouted, "Long live the Great Leap Forward!" "Long live Chairman Mao!"

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 1st - Today, 600,000 people in Xi'an held parades and gatherings in seven locations to enthusiastically celebrate International Labor Day.

Zhang Ce, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and First Secretary of the Xi'an Municipal Committee, extended festive greetings to everyone at the meeting and pointed out that the current international situation is developing in a direction favorable to socialism and world peace, the East Wind continues to prevail over the West Wind, the unity and cooperation of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is constantly strengthening, and the construction cause of socialist countries is developing rapidly. The movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America against imperialism and colonialism and for national independence continue to rise. The recent heroic struggle of the South Korean people against U.S. imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique has achieved initial victory, and the struggle of the Japanese people against the U.S.-Japan military alliance has also set off a new upsurge. The Chinese people firmly support the patriotic and just struggle of the South Korean people and the Japanese people, and firmly believe that their struggle will achieve greater victories. Zhang Ce then elaborated on the excellent leap forward situation in the country and called on the people of Xi'an to make persistent efforts, strive for greater achievements in industrial and agricultural production, and build our country into a great socialist power as soon as possible.

At other venues, workers, farmers, and students held rich and colorful celebration activities. Factories, government offices, schools, troops, and urban and rural people's communes throughout the city also held various forms of celebration activities in their respective units.

Soviet, German Democratic Republic, Czechoslovak, and Hungarian experts who are helping our country with construction in Xi'an, celebrated the festival with the workers in various factories today. Some experts participated in sports competitions, suburban outings, and other activities with the workers.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 1st - The working people of Wuhan held grand gatherings and parades today with great joy to enthusiastically celebrate the first "May Day" International Labor Day of the 1960s.

Wuhan today presented a scene of festive celebration everywhere. The Yangtze River Bridge and factories, shops, government offices, schools, and urban people's communes throughout the city were decorated with lanterns and colored banners, and huge slogans celebrating "May Day" were hung across the streets. People celebrating the festival beat gongs and drums, sang and danced, and carried various production success reports and slogans, holding parades by districts. Factories, schools, and government offices also held grand report meetings, celebration meetings, and report meetings. The builders of Wuhan Iron and Steel held a celebration parade in the Qingshan District. The charts they carried showed that in the movement to carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, 75% of the workshops in the production system have achieved full mechanization, and many operating procedures in the infrastructure construction system have been mechanized. When the workers throughout the city paraded, they also carried out propaganda activities related to the people's communes and the Great Leap Forward on the streets and in public places.

The members of the Pioneer People's Commune, the earliest urban people's commune established in Wuhan, gathered in Liberation Park, dressed in festive costumes, to celebrate the first "May Day" since the establishment of the commune.

In the evening, people held a grand garden party and fireworks display in Wuhan's largest Zhongshan Park. Leaders of the Party and government of Hubei Province and Wuhan City, along with foreign guests in Wuhan, participated in the party with the masses.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 1st - Today, all the streets and alleys of Guangzhou were hung with banners, red flags, and slogans celebrating "May Day" and praising the urban people's communes. Early in the morning, countless parade teams passed through the city, and 360,000 workers, farmers, cadres, students, and residents from across the city rushed to more than 200 venues scattered throughout the city to participate in the "May Day" celebration meeting and grand parade.

Also participating in the celebration meeting in the Cultural Park were 175 overseas Chinese who had recently returned from Indonesia, Japan, Singapore, and other places, as well as compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao.

Heads of various units and well-known advanced producers spoke at the celebration meetings. They pointed out that the current international situation is unprecedentedly favorable to peace forces and progressive forces, and unfavorable to war forces and reactionary forces. Through the unremitting struggle of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and peace-loving people all over the world, the international tensions created by imperialism have eased to a certain extent. Now is the great situation where the East Wind is constantly prevailing over the West Wind. The recent uprising of the South Korean people against the U.S.-Syngman Rhee clique drove the loyal dog of U.S. imperialism, Syngman Rhee, off the stage. This once again revealed the essence of imperialism and all reactionaries as outwardly strong but inwardly weak. They expressed their firm support for the patriotic and just struggle of the South Korean people, and their firm support for the struggle of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America for national independence and democratic freedom. Many advanced producers also expressed at the meeting that they would resolutely respond to the call of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China to work hard in May and June and strive to complete more than half of the annual output of major industrial products in the first half of the year.

Among the gatherings and parade teams, the workers and street residents' teams were the largest. The number of street residents participating in the parade was more than any previous year. In Qingping Street in the Central District, only three to five hundred residents participated in the parade in previous "May Day" celebrations, but this year the number of participants reached 1,400, most of whom were women who had been freed from household chores and participated in social labor.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 1st - More than 2.1 million people in Chongqing held gatherings, parades, and various activities today to enthusiastically celebrate International Labor Day.

The people of the city were dispersed in more than 140 locations to hold gatherings, parades, and various celebration activities. The scale of the activities was larger than in any previous year. In the urban area, more than 20,000 workers and commune members held gatherings and parades. The masses participating in the parade constantly raised their arms and shouted: "U.S. imperialism get out of South Korea! Get out of Japan! Get out of South Vietnam! Get out of Taiwan, our territory!" In the Labor People's Cultural Palace, more than 2,000 people held a city-wide celebration of the growing strength of the working class technical team. Li Tangbin, Secretary of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, said at the meeting: The current international situation is that the East Wind is further prevailing over the West Wind, and the general trend is more favorable to peace and socialism. However, U.S. imperialism is pretending to be peaceful in front of the people of the world, while at the same time frantically carrying out arms expansion and war preparations. We must work hard to strengthen ourselves, persist in the Great Leap Forward, develop socialist construction and science and technology at high speed, train a large number and quickly develop technical cadres, and establish our own scientific and technological team of the working class that is both red and expert.

Many factories, mines, and enterprises held parades and various celebration activities today. The members of the urban people's communes happily participated in various festive celebration activities today.

Today, Li Jingquan, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, First Secretary of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Party and government leaders of Chongqing City celebrated the festival with the broad masses of working people.
