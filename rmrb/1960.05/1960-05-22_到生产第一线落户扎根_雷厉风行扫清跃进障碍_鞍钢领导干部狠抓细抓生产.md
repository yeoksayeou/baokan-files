Taking Root in the Production Front Line, Sweeping Away Obstacles to the Great Leap Forward with Decisive Action
Anshan Iron and Steel Leaders Vigorously Grasp and Focus on Production

(Our dispatch from Anshan, May 21) Since the beginning of May, leaders at all levels of Anshan Iron and Steel have been taking root in the production front line, vigorously grasping and focusing on key factories and mines, important production links, and major critical issues. Throughout the company, there is a unified spirit of working together, acting decisively, being down-to-earth, and vigorously fighting for a new high tide in steel production in May and June.

The Standing Committee members of the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Anshan Iron and Steel Party Committee have all been assigned to go deep into key factories and mines, going all the way from mobilizing the masses to analyze key issues to solving them. Because the leaders are determined and the workers are enthusiastic, many key problems have been successfully resolved. Yuan Zhen, Secretary of the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and First Secretary of the Anshan Iron and Steel Party Committee, after arriving at the No. 3 Steelmaking Plant, talked to workers and held forums with workers and cadres. After he helped the workers of the No. 20 open-hearth furnace solve the problem of the mismatch between the expanded charging volume and the charging equipment, he greatly encouraged the steelmaking workers throughout the plant. The workers of the No. 20 open-hearth furnace took the lead in launching a "red character" performance competition, fiercely attacking charging and melting issues, which visibly shortened the melting time of each furnace of steel by 30 minutes. The average daily output level of the entire plant for the first twelve days of May increased sharply by about 15.8% compared to April.

Many factories and mines have already achieved the following: all important links are grasped by leading cadres, all major critical issues are grasped by leading cadres, production is grasped by leading cadres 24 hours a day, and the grasping is specific, meticulous, firm, and practical. Party secretaries, factory directors, and other leading cadres of various factories and mines have adopted a method of “contracting for key points, contracting for mobilizing and organizing workers, contracting for solving key production problems, and contracting for production to leap forward," so that many key production problems can be quickly resolved. The long furnace time and poor quality of the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant were a major obstacle to the leap forward in production. Factory Director Zeng Yangqing recently seized this issue firmly, organized the chief furnace masters of each furnace to study it together, and created a "high-temperature thin-layer circulation" furnace making method. He personally demonstrated it on the No. 1 open-hearth furnace, which not only ensured the quality of the furnace making, but also greatly shortened the furnace making time from more than eight hours to five hours and ten minutes.

After leading cadres went deep into the production front line, they also created some leadership experience for quickly solving key problems. In early May, the Large Rolling Mill experienced a contradiction between the shortage of hot steel billets and the need to speed up rolling. As soon as this problem arose, it was seized upon by the duty director, Tong Mingzhu. He immediately convened a meeting of the three steel heating workers on duty next to the soaking furnace to study. They immediately studied and successfully developed a steel heating method of frequent inspection, frequent contact, and frequent adjustment of gas. This shift heated sixty more billets than planned, creating a record for heating cold steel billets and meeting the requirements of the rolling mill. Tong Mingzhu's experience was summarized by the Party Committee of this factory as a "battlefield meeting," which was quickly used by the leading cadres of the entire factory. Many key production problems were solved on the same day or even on the same shift as they arose. In the first twelve days of May, this factory increased the production of heavy rails for the country by 428 tons.

The vigorous and meticulous efforts of leading cadres, combined with the hard work and ingenuity of the broad masses of workers, have formed an invincible force, promoting the continuous leap forward in steel production levels. Song Luyuan, Secretary of the Party Committee of the Ironmaking Plant, came to the No. 10 blast furnace and found that as iron production increased and the number of iron tapping increased, the furnace workers were too busy to pave the iron outlet well. He picked up a large crowbar and worked with the workers, studying and improving the operating techniques while working, eliminating the accidents that affected iron tapping and reduced production due to the poor paving of the iron outlet, and further improving the smelting intensity of the blast furnace. In early May, the production level of this "Blast Furnace King" increased by more than 15% compared to the first quarter; the average utilization coefficient of blast furnaces throughout the plant also reached a new height since the start of operation.

    到生产第一线落户扎根　雷厉风行扫清跃进障碍
    鞍钢领导干部狠抓细抓生产
    本报鞍山21日电　鞍钢各级领导干部5月上旬以来纷纷在生产第一线落户扎根，狠抓细抓重点厂矿、重要生产环节、重大关键问题。全公司出现了上下拧成一股绳，雷厉风行，踏踏实实，大战5、6月的钢铁生产新高潮。
    中共鞍山市委和鞍钢党委的常委委员都分工深入重点厂矿，从发动群众分析关键到解决关键，一抓到底。由于领导决心大，职工群众干劲足，许多关键问题顺利解决。中共鞍山市委书记、鞍钢党委第一书记袁振来到第三炼钢厂以后，就找工人谈话，召集工人和干部座谈。他帮助二十号平炉工人解决了由于扩大装入量带来的装料设备不相适应的问题以后，给予全厂炼钢工人很大鼓舞。二十号平炉工人带头展开“红字”表演赛，猛攻装料和熔化关，使每炉钢的熔炼时间立竿见影缩短了三十分钟，全厂5月头十二天的日产水平，平均比4月份猛增15.8％左右。
    许多厂矿都已经做到：所有重要环节都有领导干部抓，所有重大关键都有领导干部抓，昼夜二十四小时的生产都有领导干部抓，而且抓得具体，抓得细致，抓得狠，抓得实。各厂矿的党委书记、厂矿长等领导干部，这次都采取“包重点，包发动和组织工人，包解决生产关键问题，包生产跃上去”等一包到底的办法，使许多生产关键问题迅速解决。第一炼钢厂炼炉时间长、质量差，是阻碍生产跃进的一大难关。厂长曾扬清最近狠狠抓住这个问题，组织各炉总炉长一块研究，创造一种“高温薄铺循环”炼炉法，并且亲自在一号平炉上表演，不仅保证了炼炉的质量，而且大大缩短了炼炉时间，从原来的八个多小时缩短到五小时十分钟。
    领导干部深入生产第一线以后，还创造了一些迅速解决关键问题的领导经验。5月初，大型轧钢厂由于热钢坯供应不足，出现了烧钢赶不上轧钢的矛盾。这个问题一出现，就被值班主任佟明柱狠狠抓住了。他立即召集当班的三个烧钢工人在均热炉旁开会研究。他们当场研究成功一种勤检查、勤联系和勤调整煤气的烧钢方法，这一班比计划多烧六十块，创造了烧冷钢坯的最高纪录，满足了轧钢机的要求。佟明柱的这一经验，被这个厂的党委总结成为“战地会”，很快就被全厂领导干部运用起来，许多生产关键问题一出现，在当天甚至当班便解决了。这个厂在5月头十二天里，就为国家增产了四百二十八吨重轨。
    领导干部狠抓细抓，广大职工苦干巧干，结合成一种无坚不摧的力量，推动钢铁生产水平不断跃进。炼铁厂党委书记宋鲁源来到十号高炉上，就发现由于铁的产量增多，出铁次数增加以后，炉前工人忙不过来，出铁沟子铺得不好。他操起大撬棍，就和工人一块干，一边干一边研究，改进了操作技术，消灭了因为出铁沟子铺得不好，影响出铁时减风减产的事故，进一步提高了高炉冶炼强度。5月上旬，这座
  “高炉王”的生产水平比第一季度提高15％以上；全厂高炉的平均利用系数也达到开工以来的新高度。
