Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, 6th May: Premier Zhou Enlai delivered a speech at the state banquet held in his honor by the Royal Government of Cambodia today. The full text of the speech is as follows:

Your Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk,
Your Excellency Prime Minister Pho Proeung,
Ladies and Gentlemen:

Since we set foot on your beautiful land, we have been warmly welcomed and kindly received. Tonight, Your Excellency Prime Minister Pho Proeung, on behalf of the Royal Government of Cambodia, has held such a grand banquet for us. Please allow me, on behalf of myself and Vice Premier Chen Yi, to express our heartfelt gratitude to Your Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk, to Your Excellency Prime Minister Pho Proeung, and to the Royal Government and people of Cambodia. At the same time, I would also like to take this opportunity to convey the cordial greetings and best wishes of the Chinese people to the friends present and to all the Cambodian people.

Three and a half years have passed since our last visit. During this period, the traditional friendship between the Chinese and Cambodian peoples has developed in a very encouraging way. In 1958, our two countries established formal diplomatic relations, and soon after, Your Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk visited China for the second time. These are two major events in the history of Sino-Cambodian friendly relations. Our economic cooperation and cultural exchanges have been strengthened and expanded, the volume of trade has gradually increased, and mutual visits by various delegations have become more frequent. In every aspect, the friendly cooperation between our two countries is closer than before, and this is something we should celebrate. Now, as we look back with satisfaction on the friendly relations between our two countries, we are saddened by the fact that His Majesty King Suramarit, who made valuable contributions to Sino-Cambodian friendship, has departed from us forever. In order to express our condolences to the respected His Majesty King Suramarit, let us redouble our efforts to continuously strengthen and develop the friendly relations between our two countries.

After three and a half years, coming to your country again, my first impression is that you have made many achievements in various construction undertakings. In particular, your first five-year plan, which you began implementing this year, will further improve your industrial and agricultural production. We are very interested to note that Your Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk emphasizes self-reliance in economic construction and emphasizes the rapid establishment of economic independence in order to safeguard political independence. It is entirely correct and very wise to guide construction undertakings with this kind of thinking. Cambodia's construction undertakings possess many favorable conditions. Cambodia has abundant resources, most of which have not yet been developed and utilized. Preliminary exploration has already begun to expose the myth that Cambodia lacks resources. We believe that this myth will eventually be completely shattered. The Cambodian people are diligent and intelligent. We have no doubt that the Cambodian people, who once created cultural miracles like Angkor, will also be able to create miracles in the cause of building their own country. The Chinese people, who are concentrating on building their motherland, wish their Cambodian brothers continuous victories in the same great cause.

Shortly before visiting your country, Vice Premier Chen Yi and I visited Burma, India, and Nepal. What we saw and heard in these four friendly neighboring countries has made us even more firmly believe that the common desire of the people of Asian countries is to strengthen unity and cooperation and strive for a peaceful international environment in order to build up their own countries as soon as possible. The Chinese government's foreign policy has always been based on this desire of the Chinese people. The Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression signed between China and Burma, and the Treaty of Peace and Friendship signed between China and Nepal, fully express this common desire of the people of China, Burma, and Nepal. The policy of peace and neutrality consistently adhered to by Your Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk and the Royal Government of Cambodia is also fully in line with the same desire of the Cambodian people. However, imperialism is unwilling to see this desire of the people of Asian countries realized. They resort to all means to carry out subversive and assassination activities within Asian countries. They try to create divisions between Asian countries with aggressive military blocs. Recently, they have been focusing on exploiting some historically inherited problems existing between Asian countries to openly provoke discord. China has always believed that as long as the Asian countries concerned attach importance to unity and friendship, no matter how complicated the historically inherited problems are, they can certainly be resolved reasonably through peaceful consultation. We are pleased to see that the Kingdom of Cambodia has also adopted the same attitude in handling such issues with its neighbors. It is very clear that if such an attitude is not adopted, or even if imperialist views are inherited, the problem will not only not be solved, but will also become more complicated. As for the actions of a few people in certain Asian countries who serve the imperialist policy of creating division by inciting hatred movements, carrying out military threats, and deliberately expanding differences, they are even more reprehensible.

China and Cambodia have always adhered to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence in their mutual relations and have always supported each other and cooperated in a friendly manner in international affairs. Here, I would like to especially thank the Royal Government of Cambodia for its consistent just stand on issues related to China's international rights and interests. Both the construction undertakings of our two countries and the common cause of safeguarding world peace require that our two countries cooperate more closely than ever before and advance hand in hand forever. I sincerely hope that this visit of ours will be helpful in promoting friendly cooperation between the two countries. Finally, I propose a toast:

To the prosperity of the Kingdom of Cambodia and the happiness of the Cambodian people,
To the great friendship between the people of China and Cambodia,
To the unity of the people of Asian countries,
To world peace,
To the health of His Excellency Prime Minister Pho Proeung,
To the health of His Royal Highness Prince Monireth, Chairman of the Regency Council,
To the health of His Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk,
To the health of Her Majesty the Queen!
Cheers!

### 加强团结粉碎帝国主义的阴谋  周总理在柬埔寨王国政府的国宴上的讲话

    加强团结粉碎帝国主义的阴谋
    周总理在柬埔寨王国政府的国宴上的讲话
    新华社金边6日电　周恩来总理今天在柬埔寨王国政府为他举行的国宴上发表了讲话，讲话全文如下：尊敬的西哈努克亲王殿下，尊敬的福·波伦首相阁下，女士们，先生们：
    自从我们踏上了你们美丽的国土，我们一直受到你们的热情欢迎和亲切接待。今天晚上，福·波伦首相阁下又代表柬埔寨王国政府为我们举行了这样隆重的宴会。请允许我以我个人和陈毅副总理的名义，向西哈努克亲王殿下，向福·波伦首相阁下，向柬埔寨王国政府和人民，表示衷心的感谢。同时，我还愿意借这个机会向在座的朋友们和全体柬埔寨人民转达中国人民亲切的问候和最好的祝愿。
    从我们上一次的访问到现在，三年半的时间过去了。在这个期间，中柬两国人民的传统友谊有了令人十分鼓舞的发展。1958年，我们两国建立了正式的外交关系，接着不久，西哈努克亲王殿下第二次访问中国。这是中柬友好关系史上的两件大事。我们两国之间的经济合作和文化交流加强和扩大了，贸易额逐步增加了，各种代表团的相互访问日益频繁了。不论从那一方面来说，我们两国之间的友好合作都比以前更加密切，这是值得我们庆贺的。现在，当我们满意地回顾两国友好关系的时候，我们感到难过的是，对于中柬友好作出过宝贵贡献的苏拉玛里特国王陛下已经同我们永别了。为了对尊敬的苏拉玛里特国王陛下表示悼念，让我们加倍努力，使我们两国的友好关系不断地加强和发展。
    经过了三年半的时间以后再一次来到你们的国家，我首先得到的印象是，你们在各方面的建设事业中取得了很多的成就。特别是你们今年开始执行的第一个五年计划，将会使你们的工农业生产得到进一步的提高。我们很感兴趣地注意到，西哈努克亲王殿下强调在经济建设中的自力更生，强调迅速建立经济独立，以维护政治独立。用这种思想来指导建设事业，是完全正确的，是非常英明的。柬埔寨的建设事业具备了许多有利的条件。柬埔寨拥有丰富的资源，而且大多都还没有开发和利用。初步勘探的结果已经开始揭穿了关于柬埔寨缺乏资源的神话。我们相信，这个神话最后将完全破灭。柬埔寨人民是勤劳智慧的。我们毫不怀疑，曾经创造出像吴哥那样的文化奇迹的柬埔寨人民，一定也能够在建设自己祖国的事业中创造出奇迹。正在集中精力建设祖国的中国人民祝他们的柬埔寨兄弟在同样的伟大事业中不断地胜利前进。
    在访问你们的国家以前不久，我和陈毅副总理访问了缅甸、印度和尼泊尔。我们在这四个友好邻邦的所见所闻，使我们更加坚决地相信，亚洲各国人民的共同愿望是加强团结合作，争取一个和平的国际环境，以便尽快地把自己的国家建设起来。中国政府的外交政策从来就是以中国人民的这种愿望为基础的。中国同缅甸签订的友好和互不侵犯条约，中国同尼泊尔签订的和平友好条约，充分地表达了中、缅、尼三国人民的这种共同愿望。西哈努克亲王殿下和柬埔寨王国政府一贯坚持的和平中立政策，也完全符合柬埔寨人民同样的愿望。但是，帝国主义是不愿意看到亚洲各国人民的这种愿望得到实现的。他们不择手段地在亚洲各国内部进行颠覆和暗害的活动。他们力图用侵略性的军事集团在亚洲各国之间制造分裂。最近以来，他们更着重利用亚洲各国之间所存在着的一些历史上遗留下来的问题，露骨地进行挑拨离间。中国一向认为，只要有关的亚洲国家以团结和友谊为重，不管历史上遗留下来的问题是多么复杂，也一定能够通过和平协商，求得合理的解决。我们高兴地看到，柬埔寨王国在处理同邻国之间这一类问题的时候，也是采取同样的态度。事情很清楚，如果不采取这样的态度或者甚至承继帝国主义的观点，那么，问题不仅不可能解决，而且还会复杂化。至于某些亚洲国家的少数人为了替帝国主义制造分裂的政策服务。煽起仇恨运动，进行军事威胁，故意扩大分歧，那更是应该受到谴责的行为。
    中柬两国在相互关系中一向信守和平共处的五项原则，在国际事务中一向互相支持，友好合作。在这里，我要特别感谢柬埔寨王国政府在有关中国的国际权利和利益的问题上一贯采取的正义立场。不论是我们两国各自的建设事业，或者是维护世界和平的共同事业，都要求我们两国比过去任何时候更加紧密地合作，永远携手前进。我热诚地希望，我们这一次的访问对于促进两国的友好合作能够有所帮助。最后，我提议：
    为柬埔寨王国的繁荣和柬埔寨人民的幸福，
    为中柬两国人民的伟大友谊，
    为亚洲各国人民的团结，
    为世界和平，
    为福·波伦首相阁下的健康，
    为摄政委员会主席莫尼勒亲王殿下的健康，
    为西哈努克亲王殿下的健康，
    为王后陛下健康，
    干杯！
