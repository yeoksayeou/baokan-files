Xinhua News Agency, 11th Dispatch from Tokyo: Japanese newspapers are widely condemning the United States for its espionage activities against China and the Soviet Union using Japanese bases, and are unanimously demanding that the United States withdraw U-2 aircraft from Japan.

　　The "Mainichi Shimbun" published an editorial today stating that Japan must never allow US aircraft that violate Chinese and Soviet airspace and engage in espionage to use its bases.

　　The newspaper stated that the US authorities' statement did not address the Japanese people's doubts about these aircraft. The newspaper questioned why, if the US military authorities claim that the U-2 aircraft's mission is limited to meteorological observation, it has no national markings and its fuselage is coated with special radar-resistant paint?

　　The "Asahi Shimbun" published an editorial today, pointing out the fact that US U-2 aircraft have been using Japanese bases for espionage activities for quite some time. The editorial pointed out that this situation could involve Japan in international disputes and bring the flames of war to Japan. The editorial said: This is absolutely intolerable.

　　The "Asahi Shimbun" pointed out that this is a serious practical problem closely related to the new US-Japan "Security Treaty." Therefore, the Diet must seriously discuss the issue of US U-2 aircraft in Japan and investigate the truth.

　　The "Yomiuri Shimbun" published a short commentary today, pointing out that such dangerous aircraft should not be stationed in Japan.

Xinhua News Agency, 11th Dispatch from Tokyo: The Japanese news agency Kyodo News published a commentary on the 9th saying that although the US State Department announced that the U-2 aircraft is a "civilian aircraft," "it goes without saying that this type of aircraft is for collecting special military intelligence."

　　The commentary said that the US U-2 black jet was shot down over the Soviet Union. The United States has bases around the world surrounding the Soviet Union. It has been rumored for years that the United States has been sending special aircraft from these bases to collect intelligence on the Soviet Union. This incident of the aircraft being shot down has confirmed the above rumors.

　　The commentary pointed out that this aircraft "was forced to land at the Toyo Aviation Fujisawa Airport in September last year. According to eyewitnesses, the fuselage was painted with a thick, dark green, matte paint. The name 'black jet' is said to have originated from this."

　　The commentary also said, "Frankly speaking, it is not a good thing for this type of aircraft to be stationed at US military bases in Japan. Japan becoming a base for special aircraft aimed at collecting Soviet intelligence is not something that should be kept silent about. Japanese bases being used to collect Soviet intelligence is unacceptable."

Xinhua News Agency, 11th Dispatch from Tokyo: Japanese opposition party members continued to question the Kishi Nobusuke government in the Diet today regarding the issue of US U-2 aircraft conducting espionage activities against China and the Soviet Union, and demanded that the United States withdraw these aircraft from Japan.

　　Japanese Socialist Party member Kazuo Asukata revealed in the House of Representatives "Security Treaty" Special Committee that ever since the US U-2 jet aircraft was shot down over Soviet territory, Atsugi Naval Air Station has been conducting "special air defense training," and the U-2 spy planes in Japan have been using this air base all along. Asukata said that in this training, as soon as an alarm sounds, the American personnel there cover themselves with white sheets and "disappear within a minute or two." According to Asukata, Japanese employees at the base have not been notified about this special training, while in the two regular air defense training exercises in the past year, Japanese at the base were usually ordered to participate in the training.

　　After presenting these facts, Asukata said that this training must be conducted for some emergency purpose; he demanded that the government explain.

　　Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama did not dare to answer the question directly. He said something like, "There is no need to ask about the US military's air defense exercises one by one."

　　Fujiyama also arrogantly said in response to questions raised by Diet members Toshiko Matsuo and Daihachi Onuki that if the Soviet Union attacks US bases in Japan when U-2 aircraft invade Soviet airspace, Japan "will invoke Article 5 (of the new Security Treaty)." Article 5 of the new US-Japan "Security Treaty" stipulates that Japan and the United States will take joint military action.

　　Diet member Toshiko Matsuo demanded that the Japanese government make the United States withdraw U-2 aircraft from Japan. However, Fujiyama expressed his willingness to act as an accomplice to US aggression against China and the Soviet Union. He said: "Since the US military is stationed in Japan, it should naturally provide as much convenience as possible." Diet member Gentaro Takeya pointed out, "Allowing the US military to use bases is tantamount to giving up Japan's sovereignty."

Xinhua News Agency, 11th Dispatch from Tokyo: After the fact that US "U-2" aircraft used Japanese bases to carry out aggressive activities against China and the Soviet Union was revealed, Japanese Socialist Party member Isei Ide again revealed in the Diet on the 10th that the US military stationed in Japan is now also using the equipment of Japan Broadcasting Corporation (NHK) to conduct provocative broadcasts to China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

　　Japanese Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Haruhiko Uetake said vaguely in response: The US military "has recently changed to activities centered on propaganda activities."

### 日本报纸和在野党议员要求撤出进行间谍活动的Ｕ—2型飞机  揭露美国利用日本基地搜集中苏情报

    日本报纸和在野党议员要求撤出进行间谍活动的Ｕ—2型飞机   
    揭露美国利用日本基地搜集中苏情报
    新华社11日讯　东京消息：日本报纸纷纷谴责美国利用日本基地对中国和苏联进行谍报活动的罪行，并且一致要求美国从日本撤出Ｕ—2型飞机。
    “每日新闻”今天发表社论说，对于侵犯中苏、进行谍报行为的美国飞机，日本绝不能给它使用基地。
    这家报纸说，美国当局的声明并没有对日本人民对于这种飞机的怀疑作出答复。这家报纸反问道，美军当局说，Ｕ—2型飞机的任务只限于气象观测，但是如果是这样，那么为什么它没有国籍标志，并且在机身上涂上防止雷达的特殊涂料呢？
    “朝日新闻”今天发表社论，指出了美国Ｕ—2型飞机从相当长时期以来就利用日本基地进行谍报活动的事实。社论指出，这种情况有可能使日本被卷进国际纷争中，使战火燃到日本。社论说：这是绝对不能容忍的。
    “朝日新闻”指出，这是与新日美“安全条约”有着密切关系的严重的现实问题。因此国会必须认真讨论在日本的美国Ｕ—2型飞机问题，究明它的真相。
    “读卖新闻”今天发表短评指出，像这样危险的飞机不能让它驻在日本。
    新华社11日讯　东京消息：日本共同社9日发表评论说，虽然美国国务院宣布说Ｕ—2型飞机是“民用飞机”，但是，“这种飞机是为了搜集特殊军用情报，这是不用多说的”。
    评论说，美国的Ｕ—2型黑色喷气机在苏联上空被击落了。美国在苏联周围的世界各地拥有基地。早在几年以前就传说美国从这些基地派出特殊的飞机搜集着苏联的情报。这一次由于击落飞机的事件，上述传说得到了证实。
    评论指出，这种飞机“在去年9月曾被迫降落在东洋航空藤泽机场。据亲眼看到的人说，机身涂有很厚的深绿色的、没有光泽的涂料。黑色喷气机的名字，据说就是因此而起的。”
    评论还说，“坦率地说来，这种飞机被配置在驻日美军基地，并不是好事情。日本成为目的在于搜集苏联情报的特殊飞机的基地，这不是应该沉默的事情。日本的基地被用来搜集苏联的情报，是不可以的。”
    新华社11日讯　东京消息：日本在野党议员今天继续在国会里就美国Ｕ—2型飞机对中苏进行间谍活动问题向岸信介政府提出质询，并且要求美国把这种飞机撤出日本。
    日本社会党议员飞鸟田一雄在众议院“安全条约”特别委员会上揭露，自从美国Ｕ—2型喷气飞机在苏联境内被击落那天以来，厚木空军基地就进行着“特别防空训练”，而在日本的Ｕ—2型间谍飞机就一直在使用这个空军基地。飞鸟田一雄说，在这种训练中，一发警报那里的美国人员就用白被单把自己遮起来，“在一两分钟以内就不见踪影了”。据飞鸟田一雄说，基地里的日本雇员没有得到关于这种特别训练的通知，而在过去一年两次的正规防空训练中，基地内的日本人通常也被命令参加训练。
    飞鸟田一雄在提出这些事实后说，这种训练一定是根据某种紧急的目的进行的；他要求政府解释。
    日本外务相藤山爱一郎不敢正面回答这个问题。他说什么“对于美军的防空演习没有必要一次一次地问”。
    藤山还在答复议员松尾敏子和大贯大八所提问题时嚣张地说，如果苏联在Ｕ—2型飞机侵犯苏联领空时攻击美国在日本的基地，日本“就会援用（新安全条约）第五条”。新日美“安全条约”第五条规定日美两国将采取联合军事行动。
    议员松尾敏子要求日本政府使美国把Ｕ—2型飞机从日本撤走。但是，藤山却表示甘愿充当美国侵略中苏的帮凶。他说：“既然美军驻在日本，当然就要尽可能地给予方便”。议员竹谷源太郎指出，“允许美军使用基地就等于放弃日本的主权。”
    新华社11日讯　东京消息：在美国“Ｕ—2型”飞机利用日本基地对中苏进行侵略活动的事实被揭露以后，日本社会党议员井手以诚10日又在国会里揭露说，驻日美军现在还利用日本广播协会的设备，向中国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国进行挑衅性广播。
    日本邮政相植竹春彦在回答时，含糊其词地说：美军“最近已经改为以宣传活动为中心的活动”。
