The commune, under the guidance of the principle of "ensuring the main body and driving overall development," centrally organizes all forces within the city to support the great leap forward in coal production. Last year's coal output exceeded that of the extraordinary leap forward year of 1958; and the first quarter of this year set a new historical record for monthly output.

(By our reporters Han Zhifei, Wang Baoxin, and Ji Jingru) Hegang City, Heilongjiang Province, with its modern state-owned large-scale coal mines as its main body, has, since September 1958, formed a people's commune covering the entire city of 460,000 people, namely, "one city, one commune," according to the needs of the great leap forward in coal production.

Hegang City is an industrial city primarily based on coal production. The output value of the coal industry accounts for 82% of the city's total industrial output value. Coal mine workers and railway workers directly serving the mines, as well as their families, account for more than 80% of the city's population. All sectors of the city's national economy are linked to coal mines, even the shops, restaurants, and suburban non-staple food production serve the lives of the miners. However, Hegang City has long faced the contradiction of rapid development of modern coal mines while other aspects of work have lagged behind. At the time of the Northeast's liberation, Hegang Coal Mine produced 530,000 tons of raw coal annually. In the subsequent decade until 1957, this had reached 4.88 million tons, but the development of many undertakings serving the coal industry failed to keep up with the requirements of the main industry's development. The iron, steel, and machinery needed by this modern coal mine were mainly reliant on external support in the past. After the coal output needed to increase substantially in 1958, this situation became even less able to adapt to the needs of the great leap forward. In addition, the rapid development of coal production led to a sharp increase in the city's population. Hegang City grew from 30,000 people to 360,000 in 1957, and after the great leap forward, the population grew even faster to 460,000, urgently requiring a large supply of daily necessities and non-staple foods, and requiring more canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, and other public welfare services to be established. Urban construction such as housing, transportation, tap water, and cultural and recreational venues needed to keep up accordingly.

Hegang Coal Mine and the railway, the main industry and local industries, the city and the suburbs, originally only had general external collaboration relations, lacking unified planning and arrangements. Moreover, the coal mine and railway belonged to different systems. The construction of the coal mine itself had priorities, and every time a new coal mine was built, the railway department had to lay a new dedicated railway line, and the coal mine department had to add a set of electric locomotives. All of this indicated an urgent need for unification. At the same time, the great leap forward in coal production in Hegang City required an increase of several million tons of coal in a year, urgently requiring a large number of laborers. If this batch of laborers were recruited from other places, it could not be resolved in a short time, and the task was very urgent. However, there were more than 40,000 housewives and idle laborers in the city, who, after the rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle, had unprecedentedly raised their socialist awareness and also demanded to be organized to participate in production. According to the needs of the great leap forward in production and the demands of the masses, the Hegang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party established a city people's commune of one city, one commune, in September 1958.

The establishment of the "one city, one commune" urban people's commune in Hegang promoted the leap forward development of the main industry, coal production. Under the guidance of the principle of "ensuring the main body and driving overall development," the commune unified the organization and mobilization of all forces within the city to support the great leap forward in coal production. More than 50,000 people from local industries, suburban agriculture, state-owned farms, commerce, government organizations, and street residents in the city, some departments bringing their own machinery and equipment, bringing their own cars and tractors, built the Dongshan and Beidaling open-pit coal mines on a coalfield of more than 20 square kilometers in just 25 days. The amount of earthwork stripped reached more than 700,000 cubic meters, which is about twice the total amount of open-pit stripping by the Hegang Mining Bureau from 1952 to 1954. The commune also mobilized the city's forces to build 74 pairs of small coal mines in a very short time. Now, many of the newly built small coal mines in the entire mining area have been developed into medium-sized mines after rectification and improvement. In 1959, the annual output of these small mines reached 2.59 million tons, accounting for more than 20% of the total annual output of coal mines in Hegang City, laying a solid foundation for the continuous great leap forward in coal production. As a result of the support of the whole people, Hegang Coal Mine overfulfilled its production plan by 30% in the fourth quarter of 1958, when the production task was the most tense. In 1959, it reached more than 11.8 million tons, an increase of 51% over the extraordinary leap forward year of 1958. In the first quarter of this year, Hegang Coal Mine continued to make great leaps forward, overfulfilling its first quarter plan ten days ahead of schedule, creating a historical record of 1.33 million tons of monthly output. In early April, it continued to advance triumphantly, overfulfilling the plan for the first ten days of the month by 11.1%.

As a result of mobilizing the entire city's strength to "ensure the main body and drive overall development," the Hegang City urban people's commune promoted the great development of local industry and commune industry. In 1958, the output value of local industry and commune industry only accounted for 18% of the city's total industrial output value, but now it has risen to 31%. Hegang, a city that originally mainly produced coal, has rapidly developed into a comprehensive industrial city with 19 industries including steel, oil refining, machinery manufacturing, and various light industries and food industries.

This urban people's commune has also organized a large number of housewives and idle laborers to serve the lives of the miners. In the family dormitory areas of the workers, 574 public canteens, 260 nurseries and kindergartens, and a large number of life service stations have been established. These service outlets have also extended to the mine entrances, directly serving production. Now, many mines have established mine entrance canteens, stalls, barbershops, and mine entrance shops, of which there are more than 40 mine entrance canteens alone. These mine entrance canteens serve the miners around the clock. Miners can eat hot sesame cakes, oil tea, noodles, and a variety of homemade snacks before and after work. Many mine entrance service stations also prepare protective supplies for workers on time, so that workers do not have to run a long way to the coal mine management department to collect them before work. Some service personnel at the mine entrance service stations also conduct propaganda to the miners at any time according to the party's central work and political movements, combined with service work, so that the service stations also play a role in propaganda and mobilization, promoting production. After the commune organized people from production to life, the vast number of commune members have more time to study political theory and culture and technology. The city popularized central primary school education by the end of 1958, eliminating illiteracy among young adults. This year, in more than a month, it has established a full-time university, 22 amateur university classes, and more than 100 various amateur technical and cultural studies, forming an educational system from kindergartens, primary schools, middle schools to universities. More than 113,000 workers and masses have participated in the study of Marxism-Leninism centered on Chairman Mao's works.

The "one city, one commune" Hegang City urban people's commune combines industry and agriculture, connecting urban and rural areas into one, thus having the conditions to quickly change the situation in the past where the city's vegetables and non-staple foods mainly relied on external supply, achieving basic self-sufficiency in non-staple foods for the entire city, even though on average there were ten city dwellers to one suburban resident. Before the establishment of the commune, most of the non-staple foods such as pigs, chickens, fish, and vegetables needed by Hegang City relied on various parts of the province, and even needed to be purchased from Guangdong, Hebei, Shandong and other places. After the establishment of the commune, the commune mobilized the strength of 400,000 people in the entire commune, from factories and enterprises to street residents, from government schools to mass organizations, to raise pigs, chickens, grow vegetables, and vigorously develop non-staple food production. The suburbs also planned to establish a combination of large, medium and small livestock production bases. Due to the combination of actively developing suburban non-staple food production and vigorously developing non-staple food production by the whole people, Hegang City achieved basic self-sufficiency in vegetables in 1959, ending the situation of transporting vegetables from the south to the north for many years.

Now the vast masses of people in Hegang City have regarded supporting coal mines with all their strength and serving coal mine production as the most glorious duty. People say: In order to support coal mines, everything we can do, we must guarantee to do. Shi Shuqin, a female salesperson in the underground shop of the Xing'antai Coal Mine, saw that miners needed to bring lunch when they went down the mine, so she took the initiative to find ways to help cook and heat the food, and delivered the dishes and tea to the working face underground. When the workers' clothes were torn, she used the needle and thread she carried with her to carefully sew them stitch by stitch underground, which moved the miners very much. The miners praised Shi Shuqin and said: "One commodity, one heart, cooking and delivering water boosts morale, sewing clothes asks about warmth, the miners praise our 'housekeeper'."

    黑龙江鹤岗全市公社化
    公社在“保主体，带全面”的思想指导下，统一组织全市各方面的力量支援煤炭生产大跃进。去年的煤炭产量超过特大跃进的一九五八年；今年第一季度又创造了月产量的历史最高纪录。
    本报讯　记者韩之非、王宝馨、纪静如报道：以现代化国营大型煤矿为主体的黑龙江省鹤岗市，全市四十六万人从1958年9月开始，根据煤炭生产大跃进的需要，组成了一个城市人民公社，即“一市一社”。
    鹤岗市是以煤炭生产为主的工业城市，煤炭工业产值占全市工业总产值82％，煤矿职工和为它直接服务的铁路职工以及他们的家属，占城市人口的80％以上。这个城市国民经济各行各业都是和煤矿发生联系的，就连这里的商店、饭馆、郊区副食品生产也是为矿工生活服务的。但是，鹤岗市长期以来存在着现代化煤矿发展很快，而其他各方面工作跟不上的矛盾。东北解放当时鹤岗煤矿年产原煤五十三万吨，到1957年的十多年时间已达到四百八十八万吨，而其他为煤炭工业服务的许多事业的发展，却跟不上主体工业发展的要求。这个现代化的煤矿所需要为它服务的钢铁、机械，过去主要依靠外地支援。在1958年煤炭产量需要更大量增长以后，这种状况就更不能适应大跃进的需要。加上煤炭生产的飞速发展，城市人口急剧增加，鹤岗市由原来的三万人，在1957年发展到三十六万人，大跃进以后人口增长更快，又发展到四十六万人，迫切要求大量供应生活日用品和副食品，要求更多的举办食堂、托儿所、幼儿园等公共福利事业；要求住宅、交通运输、自来水、文化娱乐场所等城市建设，相适应地跟上去。
    鹤岗煤矿和铁路、主体工业和地方工业，城市和郊区，原来只有一般外部协作关系，缺乏统一的计划和安排。而且煤矿和铁路分属于不同的系统，煤矿本身的建设有先有后，每新建一个煤矿，铁路部门就得敷设一条新的铁路专用线，煤矿部门就得增加一套电气机车。这一切都说明迫切要求统一起来。同时，鹤岗市煤炭生产大跃进，一年当中要增加几百万吨煤炭，迫切需要大批的劳动力。这批劳动力若从外地招收，一时不能解决，任务又很急，而本市又有四万多名家庭妇女和闲散劳动力，经过整风和反右派斗争以后，社会主义觉悟空前提高，也要求组织起来参加生产。中共鹤岗市委根据生产大跃进的需要和群众的要求，在1958年9月就成立了一市一社的城市人民公社。
    鹤岗这个一市一社的城市人民公社一成立，就促进主体工业煤炭生产的飞跃发展。公社在“保主体，带全面”的思想指导下，统一组织和调动全市范围内各方面力量支援煤炭生产大跃进。全市的地方工业、郊区农业、国营农场、商业、机关团体和街道居民等五万多人，有的部门自带机械设备，自带汽车和拖拉机，在二十多平方公里的煤田上，仅用二十五天的时间，就建成了东山、北大岭两座露天煤矿，剥离的土方达七十多万立方米，约等于鹤岗矿务局1952年到1954年露天剥土量总和的一倍还多。公社还调动了全市的力量，在很短时间建成了七十四对小煤井。现在，整个矿区新建的小煤井，经过整顿提高，很多已发展成为中型矿井，1959年这些小矿井的年产量达到二百五十九万吨，占鹤岗全市煤矿年产量的20％以上，为煤炭生产连续大跃进，奠定了雄厚的基础。由于全民支援的结果，鹤岗煤矿在生产任务最紧张的1958年第四季度，超额30％完成生产计划。1959年又达到一千一百八十多万吨，比特大跃进的1958年增产51％。今年第一季度，鹤岗煤矿连续大跃进，提前十天超额完成首季计划，创造了月产一百三十三万吨的历史最高纪录。4月上旬，继续高歌猛进，超额11.1％完成上旬计划。
    鹤岗市城市人民公社，动员全市力量“保主体、带全面”的结果，促进了地方工业和公社工业的大发展，1958年地方工业和公社工业的产值还只占全市工业总产值的18％，现在已上升到31％。使鹤岗这个原来主要生产煤炭的城市，已迅速发展成为既大量生产煤炭，又有钢铁、炼油、机械制造，和各种轻工业、食品工业等十九个行业的综合性工业城市。
    这个城市人民公社，还把大批的家庭妇女和闲散劳动力，组织起来为矿工生活服务。在职工家属宿舍区，已经办起了五百七十四处公共食堂，二百六十处托儿所、幼儿园，和大批生活服务站。这些服务网点，还伸展到井口，直接为生产服务，现在很多矿井，已经建立起井口食堂、小卖部、理发所、井口商店，其中仅井口食堂就有四十多处。这些井口食堂昼夜不停地为矿工服务，矿工上班前和下班后，都可以吃到热腾腾的烧饼、油茶、面条，和多种自制的点心。很多井口服务站，还按时为职工准备保护用品，使职工在上班前，不必跑很远的路程到煤矿管理部门去领取，有些井口服务站的服务员，还根据党的中心工作和政治运动，结合服务工作随时向矿工进行宣传，使服务站同时起到宣传鼓动的作用，促进了生产。公社把人们从生产到生活组织起来以后，使广大社员有更多的学习政治理论和文化、技术的时间。全市在1958年底就普及了中心小学教育，扫除了青壮年中的文盲。今年在一个多月的时间，又办起了一所全日制大学，和二十二处业余大学班，和各种业余技术、文化学习一百多所，形成了从幼儿园、小学、中学到大学的教育体系。还有十一万三千多名职工群众，参加了以毛主席著作为中心的马克思列宁主义学习。
    一市一社的鹤岗市城市人民公社，使工农结合，城乡连成一片、因而有条件在平均十个城市人口，只有一个郊区人口的情况下，迅速改变过去这个城市蔬菜、副食品主要依靠外地供应的局面，达到全市副食品的基本自给。公社成立以前，鹤岗市所需要的猪、鸡、鱼、菜等副食品，大部分依靠省内各地，甚至需要从广东、河北、山东等地采购供应。建社以后，公社动员全社四十万人的力量，从工厂企业到街道居民，从机关学校到群众团体，都动手养猪、鸡，种蔬菜，大搞副食品生产。郊区还有计划的建立起大中小相结合的畜牧生产基地。由于积极发展郊区副食品生产，和大搞全民副食品生产相结合，鹤岗市在1959年就作到了蔬菜基本自给，结束了多年来南菜北运的局面。
    现在鹤岗市广大人民群众，已把全力支援煤矿，为煤矿生产服务，看成是最光荣的职责。人们说：为了支援煤矿，凡是自己能做的，一定保证做到，兴安台煤矿井下店的女售货员施淑芹，看到矿工下井的时候需要带午饭，她就主动设法帮助做饭、热饭，并且把菜肴、茶水一直送到井下的掌子面上；工人们的衣服破了，她就用带在身边的针线，在井下一针一线的细心缝补，使矿工非常感动，矿工赞扬施淑芹说：“一件商品一片心，做饭送水鼓干劲，缝补衣服问寒暖，矿工歌赞咱们的‘管家人’”。
