Xinhua News Agency, May 22nd, Jakarta Dispatch: Following the implementation of Presidential Decree No. 10, which prohibits foreign retailers from engaging in retail trade in areas below the regency capital, the Indonesian government has expanded its anti-Chinese measures to cities, prohibiting overseas Chinese from engaging in handicrafts, small-scale industries, and commerce, further打击华侨经济 (further striking at the overseas Chinese economy).

The Indonesian Minister of People's Industry, Mr. Suharto, issued a written statement on March 31st of this year, announcing that foreigners are not allowed to operate handicraft and small industrial enterprises. Suharto said: "This is the position of the Indonesian government."

  **Licenses of Overseas Chinese Operating Small Industries Such as Tofu and Soy Sauce Were Revoked by the Authorities**

According to reports, prior to this, the Industry Bureau of Jalaheng County in West Java, acting on instructions, had already revoked the licenses of 115 overseas Chinese industrial units in the county, prohibiting them from continuing to operate. The units whose licenses were revoked were mostly small industries and handicrafts that manufacture tofu, soy sauce, goldwork, dentures, and furniture.

The Gudus Tobacco Association of Pati Regency received a notice from the government in early February, instructing it to inform all overseas Chinese factories that all factories employing less than 100 workers should prepare to close down. Overseas Chinese manufacturers in the Samawang small business district of the Gedou Prefecture recently received a notice from the Industry Bureau, requiring them to return their licenses.

The local authorities of Bulucha Lake in Central Kalimantan have banned the operation of six overseas Chinese factories. In addition to prohibiting overseas Chinese from engaging in small businesses, the local authorities also prohibited 48 overseas Chinese households from working or farming locally. At present, hundreds of overseas Chinese in this area have lost their livelihoods and are in dire straits.

  **Overseas Chinese Engaging in the Purchase and Export of Native Products Prohibited by Government Orders**

Overseas Chinese engaged in commerce in some cities in Indonesia have also been subjected to various blows. According to Indonesian government orders, overseas Chinese merchants in southern Sumatran ports, including Palembang, Nanbang, and Bengkulu, have been prohibited from engaging in the trade of purchasing and exporting local products from April 1st of this year. On March 1st of this year, seven major Indonesian export products, namely rubber, coffee, pepper, coconut oil, copra, cocoa, and cinnamon, were already stipulated to be exported uniformly by Indonesian state-owned companies. Private exporters can only engage in the export trade of goods other than these seven major export products. Now, it has been further stipulated that overseas Chinese are not allowed to engage in any of these seven types of materials.

    **There are many pretexts for attacking overseas Chinese businessmen**
    **From fines and imprisonment to deportation**

In the new anti-Chinese activities, the Indonesian government has taken a series of measures. Under various pretexts such as "raising prices," "hoarding goods," "unclear accounts," and "no inventory invoices," overseas Chinese merchants are attacked. The shops and warehouses of overseas Chinese in some provinces, states, and municipalities have been searched and sealed, and some overseas Chinese businessmen have been arrested, fined, imprisoned, and sentenced to several months or even years. Many overseas Chinese businessmen have been ruined. In Jakarta, 100 overseas Chinese merchants were detained in two days, January 27th and 30th, and the value of the confiscated goods amounted to more than 10 million盾 (guilders). Overseas Chinese merchants in Bandung and Cirebon in West Java, Surabaya in East Java, and Palembang in southern Sumatra have also suffered the same persecution. In Bandung alone, 44 overseas Chinese merchants were prosecuted in just four days from February 1st to 4th, and the value of the confiscated goods was several million盾 (guilders).

Indonesian Attorney General Gunnawan also instructed all senior immigration officials in Indonesia in February of this year to punish overseas Chinese and then deport them on charges of "disrupting" the economy and public order.

In Manado, the local government even prohibits unemployed overseas Chinese from riding tricycles and driving horse-drawn carriages. This situation also occurs in some cities in Java.

    **Overseas Chinese Small Handicraft Workers and Small Businessmen are Tortured and Impoverished**

Some overseas Chinese small handicraft workers, small industrialists, and businessmen have lost their livelihoods and have been subjected to forced relocation torture, resulting in poverty and illness, and some have even committed suicide. Goldsmith Jiang Fengzhao committed suicide by taking poison on December 31st of last year when he was forced to relocate, but fortunately he was rescued and sent to the hospital. The family of seven of 70-year-old tailor Li Ruiji was persecuted by the authorities, resulting in family separation. Li Ruiji died of grief and anger on January 5th of this year.

Xinhua News Agency, May 22nd, Jakarta Dispatch: Amidst the increasingly fierce anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese activities instigated by powerful groups in Indonesia, overseas Chinese newspapers in Indonesia have also suffered severe devastation and face the threat of being completely stifled.

With the recent order to cease publication of the Jakarta "Life News," overseas Chinese in Indonesia have been deprived of their right to read the two largest-selling Chinese newspapers in Indonesia, "Life News" and "Xin Bao." The overseas Chinese "Xin Bao," founded in 1921, was forced to cease publication after the supply of newsprint was stopped.

The widely read Chinese newspaper "Xin Bao," founded in 1921, was forced to cease publication on March 1st due to the Indonesian authorities stopping the supply of newsprint.

Ignoring the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese, the Indonesian authorities issued a new regulation on February 8th of this year, canceling the licenses of overseas Chinese newspapers to purchase newsprint, which came into effect in February. It is reported that after the promulgation of this regulation, overseas Chinese newspapers requested the relevant authorities to buy paper at full price, without government paper price subsidies. However, this request was also rejected. The only reason given by the Indonesian government for canceling the licenses of overseas Chinese newspapers to purchase newsprint is to "save state expenditures." Newsprint is a controlled commodity controlled by the Indonesian government. Obviously, the implementation of this regulation will inevitably lead to the strangulation of all overseas Chinese newspapers. In fact, since the Indonesian government stopped supplying newsprint, in addition to the "Xin Bao" being forced to cease publication, other overseas Chinese newspapers have also been forced to reduce their size. These newspapers have limited paper in stock, and are currently in a very difficult situation, facing the threat of closure.

Overseas Chinese newspapers have played an active role in supporting the Indonesian people's anti-colonialist struggle and promoting understanding and friendship between the two peoples. More than 20 years ago, when President Sukarno was accused by Dutch colonialists of attempting to subvert the "Dutch East Indies regime" and prosecuted by the Bandung Court, overseas Chinese newspapers, regardless of the high pressure from the Dutch colonialists, translated and published the full text of Sukarno's speech in court, inspiring the overseas Chinese to have a warm sympathy for the Indonesian national independence movement. In 1945, when the Indonesian people were engaged in the Surabaya Defense War, the overseas Chinese newspaper "Life News," published in Jakarta under Dutch occupation, repeatedly published editorials calling on overseas Chinese to actively support the Indonesian people's struggle for independence, regardless of the persecution of the Dutch colonialists. In the Indonesian people's struggle to recover West Irian, overseas Chinese newspapers have consistently actively supported. Overseas Chinese newspapers have also extensively recommended the excellent culture of the Indonesian people, introduced the customs and habits of the Indonesian people, and promoted cultural exchanges and friendship between China and Indonesia.

    印度尼西亚排华活动日益猖狂
    下令禁止华侨在城市经营手工业、小工业和商业
    用停止供应新闻纸和莫须有的罪名扼杀华侨报纸
    新华社22日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚政府在实施禁止外国零售商在县首府以下的地区经营零售业的总统第十号法令之后，又把排华措施扩大到城市，禁止华侨经营手工业、小型工业和商业等，进一步打击华侨经济。
    印度尼西亚民间工业部长苏哈托于今年3月31日发表书面谈话，宣布外侨不准经营手工业和小工业企业。苏哈托说：“这是印度尼西亚政府的立场”。
  华侨经营豆腐、酱油等小
  型工业的执照被当局取消
    据报道，在这以前，西爪哇加拉横县的工业局根据指示就已将这个县的一百一十五个华侨工业单位的执照收回，不许他们继续营业。这些被取消执照的单位大部分为制造豆腐、酱油、打金、镶牙、家具之类的小型工业和手工业。
    巴帝州古都士烟草公会2月初接到政府通知，要它转告各华侨工厂，凡雇工在一百人以下的全部工厂做好停业的准备。格都州的三马望小商业地区华侨厂商最近接到工业局通知，要他们把执照交回。
    中加里曼丹布鲁查湖地方当局禁止了六家华侨工厂开工。地方当局除了禁止华侨经营小商业之外还禁止当地四十八户华侨做工或种田。目前这一地区数百名华侨生计断绝，陷于困境。
  华侨经营收购和输出土产
      遭到政府命令禁止
    在印度尼西亚一些城市中经营商业的华侨也遭到各种各样的打击。在苏门答腊南部港口，包括巨港、楠榜、明古连等地的侨商，根据印度尼西亚政府命令，从今年4月1日起，不得再经营收购土产与输出土产的贸易。今年3月1日，印度尼西亚七种主要的出口土产，即橡胶、咖啡、胡椒、椰油、椰干、可可及桂皮已经规定须由印度尼西亚国营公司统一输出。私人出口商只能经营此七种主要出口土产以外的出口贸易。现在又更进一步连这七种以外的物资也全不许华侨经营。
    打击华侨商人的名目繁多
    从罚款坐牢直到驱逐出境
    在新的排华活动中印度尼西亚政府采取了一系列的措施。在所谓
  “抬高物价”、“囤积货物”、“账簿不清”、“没有存货发票”等各种各样的名目下，打击华侨商人。有些省、州、市辖区的华侨商店、仓库被搜查、标封，有些侨商被拘捕、罚款、坐牢，判刑几个月甚至几年。不少华侨商人弄得倾家荡产。在1月27日和30日的两天内，雅加达就有一百名华侨商人被扣，被没收的货物价值达一千万盾以上。西爪哇的万隆、井里汶，东爪哇的泗水，苏门答腊南部的巨港等地的侨商也遭到同样的迫害。仅2月1日到4日的四天内，万隆一市就有四十四家侨商被控告，被没收的货物值数百万盾。
    印度尼西亚最高检察长贡纳万今年2月还训令印度尼西亚各地的所有移民厅高级官员，用“扰乱”经济和治安的罪名把华侨加以处罚后，驱逐出境。
    在万鸦老，地方政府甚至不准失业的华侨蹬三轮车和赶马车。这种情况在爪哇岛一些城市也同样发生。
    华侨小手工业者和小商人被折磨得贫病交迫
    一些华侨小手工业者和小工业者及商人在生活上丧失了生计，又遭受逼迁折磨，弄得贫病交加，有的甚至自杀。金匠江逢照于去年12月31日遭逼迁时服毒自杀，幸遇救送往医院。七十岁老裁缝李瑞基一家七口，因遭到当局迫害，弄得妻离子散，李瑞基于今年1月5日忧愤死去。
    据新华社22日讯　雅加达消息：在印度尼西亚有势力集团策动的日益凶恶的反华排华活动声中，印度尼西亚的华侨报纸也遭受严重摧残，并面临着被全部扼杀的威胁。
    随着雅加达“生活报”最近被勒令停刊，印度尼西亚华侨已被剥夺他们阅读印度尼西亚两家销数最大的华文报纸——“生活报”和“新报”——的权利。1921年创刊的华侨“新报”在
  停止供应新闻纸后被迫停刊
    拥有广泛读者的在1921年创刊的华文报纸“新报”，由于印度尼西亚当局停止供应新闻纸已在3月1日被迫停刊。
    不顾华侨的正当权益，印度尼西亚当局竟在今年2月8日颁布了取消华侨报纸购买新闻纸的许可证的新条例，从2月份开始实行。据悉，在这个条例颁布以后，华侨报纸曾向有关当局要求按全部价格买纸，不要政府的纸价补贴。但是，这一要求也遭到拒绝。而印度尼西亚政府取消华侨报纸购买新闻纸的许可证的唯一理由是“节省国家开支”。新闻纸是印度尼西亚政府控制的统制物资，很显然，实施这个条例的结果，所有华侨报纸势必都将被绞杀。实际上，自从印度尼西亚政府停止供应新闻纸以来，除“新报”被迫停刊外，其他华侨报刊也被迫缩少篇幅。这些报刊存纸有限，目前处境都非常困难，面临着停刊的威胁。
    华侨报纸在支持印度尼西亚人民的反殖民主义斗争、促进两国人民的了解和友谊方面，一直起着积极作用。早在二十多年以前，苏加诺总统被荷兰殖民主义者指控为企图颠复“荷印政权”，由万隆法院起诉，当时，华侨报纸不顾荷兰殖民者的高压，全文译载了苏加诺在法院上的发言，激发了华侨对印度尼西亚民族独立运动的热烈同情。1945年印度尼西亚人民在进行泗水保卫战的时候，在荷兰占领下的雅加达出版的华侨报纸“生活报”不顾荷兰殖民者的迫害，一再发表社论号召华侨积极支持印度尼西亚人民的独立斗争。在印度尼西亚人民收复西伊里安的斗争中，华侨报纸也一贯积极支持。华侨报纸还大量推荐印度尼西亚人民的优秀文化，介绍印度尼西亚人民的风土人情和风俗习惯，促进了中国和印度尼西亚两国的文化交流和人民之间的友谊。
