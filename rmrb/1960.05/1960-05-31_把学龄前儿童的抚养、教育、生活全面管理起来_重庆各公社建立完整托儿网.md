Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, May 30th: Since the vigorous establishment of urban people's communes in Chongqing, the collective welfare undertakings for children have developed rapidly. At present, the city's urban people's communes have established more than 2,800 nurseries, kindergartens, and infant rooms, nearly doubling the number before the vigorous establishment of urban people's communes. The number of children enrolled has increased by 1.7 times. Communes have also established a large number of factories and life service organizations and health organizations dedicated to serving children. Some communes have even established children's parks and various recreational venues for children.

In vigorously developing children's welfare undertakings, Chongqing's urban people's communes have given full play to the superiority of being organized, and have fully relied on the masses to overcome difficulties such as a shortage of manpower and materials. As soon as the Shimen People's Commune was established, the commune's Party committee made a unified plan for the development of childcare organizations. In addition to relying on factories, enterprises, and government organizations to establish childcare organizations and expand the enrollment of existing childcare organizations, the commune also fully relied on the masses, made use of existing facilities, and started from scratch to vigorously establish simple nurseries, kindergartens (stations) and other childcare organizations. The commune also systematically organized commune members and factory workers to form various service teams to repair houses, manufacture desks, chairs, and other equipment and daily necessities for nurseries and kindergartens. The commune also uniformly transferred a group of politically progressive and enthusiastic activists in childcare to serve as childcare workers. In this way, the commune's childcare organizations developed rapidly, and the number of children enrolled increased 33 times compared with before the establishment of the commune. Before the establishment of the Qixinggang People's Commune, there were only seven nurseries in the area. After the establishment of the commune, all commune members were mobilized to do good deeds for the nurseries, and the difficulties of lacking houses and equipment were quickly resolved, enabling the childcare organizations to develop to 102, with more than 10,000 children enrolled. The commune also established 36 toddler teams and four children's parks in a simple and practical manner, according to local conditions, so that 95% of the children received collective education.

Chongqing's urban people's communes have also established a complete childcare network around nurseries and kindergartens, including life service networks, health networks, education and guidance networks, and business guidance networks. Generally, communes have established a life service network centered on children's canteens, including children's non-staple food processing plants, children's clothing factories, children's shoe factories, toy factories, children's goods factories, barber shops, bathhouses, and laundry and sewing stations, implementing specialized management of children's life needs, which is centrally managed by nurseries and kindergartens. Communes have also established a health network centered on medical institutions, including children's sanatoriums and isolation rooms. Nurseries (kindergartens) also have full-time or part-time health workers who regularly examine the children's bodies. The education and guidance network established by the commune, centered on children's parks, regularly holds various educational activities for children, such as story meetings, singing, dancing, gymnastics performances, and game competitions. The commune has also established a business guidance network centered on larger nurseries (kindergartens) to help newly built nurseries (kindergartens) improve their professional level and improve management methods. After the establishment of these childcare networks, the upbringing, education, and life of preschool children have been comprehensively managed. After the Qixinggang People's Commune established eight children's canteens and 23 children's goods and non-staple food factories, children were able to eat various nutritious foods and buy suitable and beautiful clothes and various utensils according to their age and physical development needs. After the commune established a children's health network, it observed children's health every day and conducted regular examinations, making more than 95% of the nurseries (kindergartens) disease-free, and greatly reducing the incidence of childhood diseases.

    把学龄前儿童的抚养、教育、生活全面管理起来
    重庆各公社建立完整托儿网
    新华社重庆30日电　重庆市大办城市人民公社以来，儿童集体福利事业有了飞速发展。目前，全市各城市人民公社办的托儿所、幼儿园和婴儿室已经有二千八百多个，比大办城市人民公社前增长将近一倍；入托的儿童数增长了一点七倍。公社还大量举办了专为儿童服务的各种工厂和生活服务组织、保健组织，有的公社还为儿童建立了儿童乐园和各种游乐场所。
    重庆市各城市人民公社在大办儿童福利事业中，充分发挥了组织起来的优越性，并且充分依靠群众，克服了人力物力不足等困难。石门人民公社一成立，公社党委就统一作出了发展托儿组织的规划。这个公社除依靠工厂企业、机关兴办托儿组织和扩大原有托儿组织的收容额外，还充分依靠群众，因陋就简，白手起家，大力兴办简易托儿所、幼儿园（站）等托儿组织。公社还有计划地组织社员和工厂职工成立各种服务队，为托儿所、幼儿园修缮房屋、制造桌椅等设备和日常用具。这个公社还统一从各个岗位上抽调一批政治进步、热心托儿保育事业的积极分子来担任保育员。这样，全社的托儿组织就迅速发展起来，入托儿童比建社前增加了三十三倍。七星岗人民公社建社前，当地只有七个托儿所，公社建立后，发动全体社员为托儿所大办好事，很快解决了缺乏房屋、设备等困难，使托儿组织发展到一百零二个，有一万多个儿童入托；公社还因陋就简、因地制宜地建立了三十六个幼儿队和四个儿童乐园，使95％的儿童都受到了集体教育。
    重庆市的各城市人民公社还围绕托儿所、幼儿园等建立了一套包括生活服务网、保健网、教育辅导网、业务辅导网的完整的托儿网。一般的公社都建立了以儿童食堂为中心，包括儿童副食品加工厂、童装厂、童鞋厂、玩具厂、儿童用品厂和理发室、浴室、浆洗缝补站的生活服务网，对儿童生活方面的需要实行分工分业经营，又集中由托儿所、幼儿园统一进行管理。公社还以医疗机构为中心，建立了包括儿童休养所、隔离室等的保健网，托儿所（园）还设有专职或兼职的保健员，定期为孩子们检查身体。公社建立的以儿童乐园为中心的教育辅导网，经常为孩子们举行各种富有教育意义的活动，如举行故事会、歌舞和体操表演会、游戏比赛等。公社还以较大的托儿所（园）为中心建立了业务辅导网，帮助新建所（园）提高业务水平，改进管理方法。这些托儿网建立起来以后，把学龄前儿童的抚养、教育、生活全面地管理了起来。七星岗人民公社办起了八个儿童食堂和二十三个儿童用品和副食品工厂后，使儿童能够按照年龄的大小和身体发展的需要，吃到各种营养食品，买到合适美观的衣物和各种用具。这个公社建立儿童保健网后，对儿童健康天天观察，定期检查，使95％以上的托儿所（园）成了无病所（园），儿童的发病率大大降低。（附图片）
