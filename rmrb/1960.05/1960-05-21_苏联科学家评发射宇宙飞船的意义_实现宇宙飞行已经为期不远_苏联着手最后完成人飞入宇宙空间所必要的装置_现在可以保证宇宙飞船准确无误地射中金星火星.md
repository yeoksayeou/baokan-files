Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 17th. Soviet scientists continue to publish articles in newspapers and periodicals, discussing the significance of the Soviet Union's recent launch of spaceships and its impact on scientific development.

Academician Blagonravov of the Soviet Academy of Sciences said that achieving human spaceflight will have great significance for the development of science. The successful launch of the spaceship means that the realization of such human spaceflight is not far off.

Kroshkin wrote that in the process of launching the first Soviet spaceship, some problems are being solved, such as how to prevent humans from being harmed by external influences and ensuring safe launch and return from a technical perspective.

Academician Palin of the Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences said that the Soviet Union's launch of a spaceship is the most important preparation before humans enter the space surrounding the Earth. Soviet scientists have obtained a great deal of valuable material regarding the physiological reactions of humans in spaceflight. However, the materials currently available are not sufficient regarding how to avoid the effects of cosmic rays on space travelers. Palin also said that, according to space medicine judgments, astronauts should undergo a period of rigorous training before flying to adapt to the various special conditions of spaceflight. The problem of supplying food, water, and oxygen to astronauts for relatively short periods of spaceflight has been solved. However, for long-term interstellar astronauts, even if food can be replaced with highly concentrated products, the problem of oxygen supply still needs further research. However, the days of solving these problems are not far off.

Zabelin, Deputy Doctor of Geography of the Soviet Union, said that the spaceship experiment is important for the development of space botany, space geography, and space geology. When scholars study the geology, geography, and biosphere of other planets, an important issue at present is to overcome the obstruction of the Earth's atmosphere. Therefore, in order to further develop these three sciences, it is necessary to bring instruments outside the atmosphere for observation. In this way, many new phenomena will be discovered.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 18th. Soviet scientists have published articles and given talks, expressing their opinions on the significance of the Soviet satellite spaceship for human space travel and the first human space travel.

Professor Rozinberg wrote in Izvestia on the 18th that Soviet design scientists have begun the final completion of all the equipment necessary for humans to fly into space. The satellite spaceship is the first in a series of satellites designed to solve the problem of humans entering space. Its launch should promote the solution of a series of scientific and technological and scientific methodological problems.

The article said that future spaceships should become ecologically self-sufficient systems, that is, they can guarantee that people on the satellite enjoy all the conditions necessary for life activities in a small cabin.

He also pointed out that the accuracy of the Soviet rocket launched into the Pacific Ocean means that it is now possible to guarantee that spaceships accurately hit Venus or Mars.

Sisagyan, head of the Department of Biological Sciences of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, said that the first spaceship launched by the Soviet Union has the same equipment as a spaceship with a cosmonaut on board. Due to the successful launch of the Soviet spaceship, Soviet scientists have once again confirmed that their calculations are correct, and the assertions of some American scientists are unfounded. For example, American designers apparently cannot solve the problem of increasing the weight of satellites, so they comfort themselves by saying that weight and volume are meaningless. However, every sane person understands that only in a sufficiently spacious laboratory equipped with all the necessary equipment can people conduct investigations in space.

### 苏联科学家评发射宇宙飞船的意义  实现宇宙飞行已经为期不远  苏联着手最后完成人飞入宇宙空间所必要的装置  现在可以保证宇宙飞船准确无误地射中金星火星

   苏联科学家评发射宇宙飞船的意义
   实现宇宙飞行已经为期不远
   苏联着手最后完成人飞入宇宙空间所必要的装置
   现在可以保证宇宙飞船准确无误地射中金星火星
    据新华社莫斯科17日电　苏联科学家继续在报刊上发表文章，谈这次苏联发射宇宙飞船的意义和对于科学发展的影响。
    苏联科学院院士布拉冈拉沃夫说，实现人的宇宙飞行对于科学的发展将有巨大意义。而实现这样的宇宙飞行由于宇宙飞船的发射成功已经为期不远了。
    克罗什金写道，在第一艘苏联宇宙飞船发射的过程中正解决着部分使人避免受外界有害的影响和技术上保证安全发射及返回等问题。
    苏联医学科学院院士帕林说，苏联发射宇宙飞船，是人进入地球周围的宇宙空间前最重要的准备工作。苏联科学家关于人在宇宙飞行中的生理反应方面，已经取得了许多宝贵材料。但是，对于如何避免宇宙射线对于宇宙飞行者的影响问题，目前掌握的材料还不够充分。帕林还说，根据宇宙医学的判断，宇宙飞行员在飞行之前应当进行一个时期的严格训练，以适应宇宙飞行时的各种特殊条件。对于比较短时期的宇宙飞行，供给飞行员食物、饮水和氧气的问题目前已经解决。但是对于长期星际飞行员来说，即使食物能用高度浓缩品来代替，但氧气的供应问题还需要进一步研究。不过解决这些问题的日子不会很远了。
    苏联地理学副博士扎别林说，宇宙飞船的试验对于发展宇宙植物学、宇宙地理学和宇宙地质学有重要作用。在学者研究其他行星的地质、地理以及生物界问题时，目前一个重要的问题是要克服地球大气层的妨碍问题。因此为了进一步发展这三门科学，必需把仪器带到大气层之外进行观测。这样就会发现许多新的现象。
    据新华社莫斯科18日电　苏联科学家纷纷发表文章和谈话，就苏联卫星式飞船对人到宇宙中旅行的意义和第一批人到宇宙中去旅行的问题发表了意见。
    罗津别尔格教授18日在“消息报”上撰文说，苏联设计科学家开始了人飞入宇宙空间所必要的一切装置的最后完成工作。卫星式飞船是用来解决人进入宇宙的问题的一系列卫星中的第一个。它的发射应促进一系列科学技术和科学方法学问题的解决。
    文章说，未来的宇宙飞船应当成为一个在生态学上是自成体系的系统，即可以保证卫星上的人在容积不大的舱内享有生命活动所必要的一切条件。
    他还指出，苏联发射到太平洋的火箭的准确程度意味着，现在就已经可以保证宇宙飞船准确无误地射中金星或火星。
    苏联科学院生物学部领导人西萨基扬说，苏联发射的第一个宇宙飞船，具有像有一位宇宙航行家乘坐其中的宇宙飞船一样的装备。由于苏联宇宙飞船发射成功，苏联科学家再次证实了自己的计算是正确的，而美国某些科学家的断言是毫无根据的。例如，美国设计师们显然解决不了增大卫星重量的问题，因而自我安慰说，重量和体积没有什么意义。然而每一个头脑健康的人都懂得，只有在一个足够宽敞和装备有一切必要设备的实验室里，人才可能在宇宙中进行考察。
