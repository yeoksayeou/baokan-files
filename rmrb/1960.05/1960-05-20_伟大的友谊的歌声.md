    The performance of the Soviet Artists Troupe presented us with a magnificent picture: the excellent and ancient traditions of Soviet national arts have been unprecedentedly developed under the socialist system, truly like a spring garden, with hundreds of flowers blooming in riotous profusion.

    The repertoire of the young pianist Tamila Makhmutova eloquently illustrates this point. Khachaturian's "Toccata" inlaid folk melodies as beautiful as jewels and folk rhythms as strong as liquor in the classical form, reminding us of the vigorous figures and bold character of the Armenian people. Rachmaninoff's waltz took us to another realm—passionate and elegant. Gadjiev's two dances brought us back to the highlands of Azerbaijan, with their intoxicating melodies and steps. What is gratifying is that all of this is vividly portrayed by the pianist, whose performance is fluent and subtle, demonstrating the simple essence of the Russian school.

    Honored Soloist Alexander Yakovenko sang Russian and Ukrainian folk songs. We know that folk songs, with their every word a gem, are much more difficult to sing than those gorgeous and magnificent opera recitatives. There is no room for showing off skills here, but singers are required to have a high degree of skill—solid breath and sound, superb interpretation, and a true sense of music. Alexander Yakovenko accomplished this with his mature skills and rich experience. When he sang Dunayevsky's "Drinking Song," he vividly expressed the passionate and heroic emotions in the work of this master of popular songs.

    Gavril Azimov's tambourine solo is not unfamiliar to us. His previous visit to our country left us with a deep and unforgettable impression. He can express complex rhythms and emotional changes on this percussion instrument, which can sound like "golden drums beating and thousands of troops galloping" when high-pitched, and can also achieve a state of "weeping and complaining" when low-pitched. Alexander Lezhechkov's bayan (button accordion) solo truly deserves to be from the country of the bayan. The ancient instrument, which is popular in Russia, Ukraine... has a deep tradition, and its performance has been highly developed. The characteristic of Lezhechkov's performance is also to incorporate high skills into superb interpretation. Originally, the bayan is an instrument that can show off skills, but the soloist never abuses this method of expression, but proceeds from the content of the music, so as to achieve the effect of sometimes being as fiery as fire and sometimes as gentle as singing.

    Zafar Chabarbayev, the soloist from the Kyrgyz Republic, has a distinct national style in his singing. While maintaining the characteristics of national singing, he also draws on the Western European academic singing method, which can serve as an example for young singing students in our country. It seems that there are many nasal sounds in the Kyrgyz language. How to be faithful to the pronunciation and develop the expressiveness of the voice is a very difficult task, but the singer has achieved commendable success in this regard. Konstantin Mikheev's xylophone solo, whether it is Khachaturian's rough Sabre Dance or Liszt's magnificent Hungarian Rhapsody, he played them vividly and powerfully.

    Yuri Karkin, a soloist from the Moscow Grand Theater, sang Russian and Ukrainian folk songs and an aria from Rimsky-Korsakov's "The Snow Maiden." His majestic voice embodies the characteristics of the Russian school, unrestrained emotions and solid skills, all of which must be subordinate to the interpretation and re-creation of the musical content.

    I cannot describe those exquisite dance programs one by one. Lidia Krubinyina and Yuri Grevtsov are already our old friends. Their visit and performance at the Novosibirsk Opera and Ballet Theater still leaves a vivid impression. Their characteristics are amazing skills and unparalleled accuracy. While the solo dancers of the Ural State Folk Choir Dance Troupe, Larisa Brusnichina and Dmitry Kharkov, movingly expressed the style of folk dance, which cleverly combines enthusiasm, humor, and poetry. Klara Yushupova, a soloist from the Tashkent Opera and Ballet Theater, is a young master of folk dance. In the Uzbek dance and the Khorazm dance, she shows the amazing skills of traditional folk dance on the one hand, and appropriately introduces some expressive elements of ballet on the other hand, making the two combine seamlessly; this must be done on the premise of mastering all the skills of folk dance and ballet. Her own choreographed works convincingly show that this talented young master has achieved gratifying success.

    The climax of the concert was the moving scene of all the actors singing "Moscow-Beijing" together. The audience also cheered and applauded to the rhythm of this song praising the great friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union. Both on and off the stage were bathed in the noble, intoxicating feelings of great friendship!

    伟大的友谊的歌声
    赵沨
    苏联艺术家表演团的演出，在我们面前展示了一幅壮丽的图画：苏联各民族艺术的优秀而古老的传统在社会主义制度下得到了空前的发展，真像春天的花园，百花盛开，万紫千红。
    年青的钢琴家塔米拉·玛赫木托娃的曲目雄辩地说明了这一点。哈恰图良的“触奏曲”在古典的形式中镶嵌了美如宝玉的民间音调和浓如烈酒的民间节奏，使我们想起亚美尼亚人民的矫健的身影和豪放的性格。而拉赫玛尼诺夫的圆舞曲则把我们带到了另外的境界——热情而典雅。加治叶夫的两首舞曲又使我们回到阿塞拜疆的高原，那令人沉醉的音调和舞步，可喜的是这一切都生动地为钢琴家刻划出来了，她的演奏流利而含蓄，表现了俄罗斯学派质朴的本色。
    功勋独唱家亚历山大·雅科文卡演唱了俄罗斯、乌克兰的民歌。我们知道，字字珠玉的民歌是比那些华丽壮阔的歌剧诵叹调在演唱上要困难得很多很多，这里没有施展技巧的余地，但却又要求歌唱家具有高度的技巧——坚实的呼吸和声音、精湛的解释和真正的乐感。亚历山大·雅科文卡以她成熟的技巧和丰富的经验做到了这一点，当她演唱杜那也夫斯基的“饮酒歌”时，把这位群众歌曲的大师的作品中的热情豪迈的情感表现得淋漓尽致。
    加夫尔·阿齐莫夫的手鼓独奏对我们已经不是生疏的了，他过去访问我国时便给我们留下了深刻难忘的印象。在这件打击乐器上表现复杂的节奏和情绪的变化，高亢时真像“金鼓齐鸣，千军万马”，而低婉时也能达到“如泣如诉”的境界。亚历山大·列兹契科夫的巴扬琴（纽式手风琴）独奏，真正不愧是来自巴扬琴的国家的代表。流传于俄罗斯、乌克兰……的古老乐器有着深厚的传统，而在演奏上又得到高度的发展。列兹契科夫演奏的特点也是寓高度的技巧于精湛解释之中。本来，巴扬琴是大可炫耀技巧的乐器，但是，独奏家却从不滥用这种表现方法，而是一切从音乐的内容出发，因而才能达到时而热烈如火、时而婉转如歌的效果。
    吉尔吉斯共和国的独唱家扎法尔·恰巴尔达也夫的演唱具有鲜明的民族风格，他在一方面保持民族演唱特点，另一方面借鉴西欧学院唱法上可以作为我国青年歌唱学生的范例。看来，吉尔吉斯的语言中有不少的鼻音，怎样才能忠实于语音而又能发展声音的表现力，是十分艰难的课题，但歌唱家正是在这方面获得了难能可贵的成就。康斯坦丁·米赫叶夫的木琴独奏，无论是哈恰图良
  的粗犷的马刀舞曲还是李斯特的壮丽的匈牙利狂想曲，他都演奏得有声有色、有气有势。
    莫斯科大剧院的独唱家尤里·卡尔金演唱了俄罗斯和乌克兰的民歌和里姆斯基—柯萨可夫的“雪公主”中的咏叹调。他的雄壮的声音体现了俄罗斯学派的特点，奔放的情感和坚实的技巧，而这一切都必须服从于对音乐内容的解释和再创造。
    我不能一一叙述那些精美的舞蹈节目了。李吉娅·克鲁宾尼娜和尤里·格列夫佐夫已经是我们的老朋友了，他们在新西伯利亚歌舞剧院的访问演出中，至今仍然留下鲜明的印象。他们的特点是惊人的技巧和无比的准确。而乌拉尔国家民间合唱团舞蹈队独舞演员拉莉莎·勃鲁斯尼契娜和季米特里·哈尔科夫则动人地表现了民间舞蹈把热烈、幽默和诗意巧妙地揉合在一起的风格。塔什干歌舞剧院的独舞家克拉拉·尤舒波娃是民间舞的青年大师，她在乌兹别克舞和贺列兹姆斯基舞中，一方面表现了传统民间舞蹈的惊人技巧，另一方面又适当地引进了芭蕾的某些表现方法的因素，而使二者结合得天衣无缝；这必须要在精通民间舞和芭蕾的全部技巧的前提下才能做到，她自己编舞的作品令人信服地说明了这位才华洋溢的青年大师已经得到可喜的成功。
    音乐会的高潮是全体演员高歌“莫斯科—北京”的动人场面。全场也随着这歌颂中苏两国人民伟大友谊的歌曲的节拍而欢呼鼓掌，台上台下都沐浴于这种崇高、沉醉的伟大的友谊的感情之中！
