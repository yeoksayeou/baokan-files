	A New Book on the Xinhai Revolution
	Chen Xulu

	Recently, the People's University Press published "The Xinhai Revolution" written by Comrade Wu Yuzhang. This book is not very long, but it is rich in content. From the economic base to the superstructure, from the struggle in the political and ideological fields to the armed uprising, from the revolutionary masses to the activities of the leading figures, from the victorious development of the revolution to the compromise and failure, the book contains concise explanations. In particular, the book provides relatively profound analyses and incisive arguments on many key issues in the history of the Xinhai Revolution.

	The people are the creators of history. The book attaches great importance to the role of the people in the Xinhai Revolution. The author writes: During the Xinhai Revolution, "the revolutionaries had confidence in the revolution mainly because of the revolutionary fervor of the broad masses." This first reveals that the revolutionary fervor of the broad masses was the source of revolutionary power. The revolutionaries in China in the early twentieth century dared to stand up and overthrow the Qing Dynasty and the emperor, precisely because they relied on the support and promotion of this force, although the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois revolutionaries did not truly recognize this point.

	The social composition of those who participated in the Xinhai Revolution was very complex. Why was it so complex? The book explains it this way: At that time, "not only did many workers, peasants, and handicraftsmen rise up to resist, but also many more enlightened landlords showed unease and wanted to seek economic and political solutions. Where was the way out? At that time, feudalism had no way out. The only way out was to follow the bourgeoisie. Therefore, many of them were involved in bourgeois political activities, either becoming followers of Sun Yat-sen or becoming followers of Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao." From this, it can be seen that the unprecedented turmoil in Chinese society at that time and the intense changes in class relations, whether following Sun Yat-sen or Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao, were all about finding their own way out, the capitalist way out.

	The constitutionalists during the Xinhai Revolution opposed both the revolution and the Qing government's stubbornness. To which class did this group of people belong? What impact did they have on the Xinhai Revolution? This is an issue that the historical community has been debating. The book points out: "The constitutionalists, led by Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao, represented the right wing of the bourgeoisie and a portion of the landlord bureaucrats"; and the provincial assemblies and the national assembly, the venues for the constitutionalists' activities, "were organs similar to bourgeois parliaments." However, in the serious struggle of the revolutionaries to overthrow the Qing Dynasty, the constitutionalists' stance was not without change. The book states: "Although the vast majority of members of the provincial assemblies were reformists who did not approve of revolution, in the end they still became unconscious tools of the revolution." They did not become tools willingly, but were forced to by the Qing government; this change was even more pronounced in the two or three years from 1909. Because the Qing government delayed constitutionalism and borrowed foreign debt to build railways, etc., blocking their demands for a capitalist path, they came out to make trouble, and made trouble fiercely, making the Qing government even more isolated. At the same time, the revolutionary masses joined their struggle, pushing the struggle towards a revolutionary movement against the Qing Dynasty's rule. We know that the constitutionalists once stood in strict opposition to the revolutionaries in terms of political line. The reason they "ultimately became unconscious tools of the revolution" was because they also had the desire to take the capitalist road, which was their common ground with the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois revolutionaries. Later, the revolutionaries only saw this commonality, especially being deceived by the constitutionalists' expression of support for the republic when the Qing emperor abdicated, thus abandoning the struggle against them. The author says: The constitutionalists "never forgot their political differences with the revolutionaries, and were always on guard against the revolutionaries excluding them." This is an extremely profound analysis, and should be a warning to all revolutionaries.

	Therefore, the provincial assemblies controlled by the constitutionalists, "before the revolution, on the one hand, weakened the revolutionary forces; on the other hand, because they demanded political reform and exposed the Qing government's corruption and incompetence, they promoted the development of the revolutionary movement. After the revolution, although it tried its best to show that it was a supporter of the republican system, because it formed an alliance with the old forces to resist the revolutionaries, it actually hindered the development of the revolutionary movement." Here, the author not only dialectically demonstrates the relationship between the constitutionalists and the Xinhai Revolution, but also, in particular, dialectically demonstrates its reactionary influence on the Xinhai Revolution. This makes people even more vigilant that all reformists, even reformists like Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao, although the reform movements they advocated once produced a positive effect under China's special historical conditions, will ultimately become the opposite of the revolution and even corrupt the revolution.

	The political program of the revolutionary party is a pointer for revolutionary action and has important significance for the development of the revolution. The political program of the Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance) was: "Expel the Tartars, restore China, establish a republic, and equalize land ownership," which is known to everyone. The author does not narrate this program in parallel, but makes a scientific analysis of it, saying: "The program of the Tongmenghui was of a bourgeois nature, in addition to overthrowing the Qing government, it also advocated establishing a republic, and based on Sun Yat-sen's proposal, added a clause on equalizing land ownership." This makes it clear to readers at a glance that, of the Tongmenghui's program, only the overthrow of the Qing government was accepted by everyone and strived to be realized. Overthrowing the Qing Dynasty and establishing a republican government was the inevitable trend at that time, but some people also thought that as long as the Qing Dynasty was overthrown, it would not matter what kind of government was established. As for equalizing land ownership, it was almost only the program of Sun Yat-sen and other individual revolutionaries. Therefore, the propaganda of this program "gave the deepest impression on only two points: one is anti-Manchu; the other is the glorious tradition of the Han ancestors." This is indeed the case. Whether we open the Tongmenghui's newspaper "Min Bao" (People's Report) or books with the greatest propaganda power such as "Revolutionary Army," "Alarm Bell," and "Emperor Huang," propaganda on these two aspects is the most numerous. Although it stirred up a revolutionary storm, it had great weaknesses. Based on this fact, the book analyzes: "The slogan of anti-Manchu was too simple. It concentrated all hatred on the Manchu rulers, mixed with the racialist sentiment of the Han people, and did not truly raise the national consciousness of the entire people. As a result, it let go of a real national enemy—the foreign invaders. Similarly, the propaganda of the glorious tradition of the Han ancestors was also too simple. It did not criticize or oppose the Han feudalism that had ruled China for a long time, which let go of a major internal enemy, that is, the Han feudal forces that supported the Qing Dynasty's rule." China's bourgeois democratic revolution was to thoroughly oppose imperialism and feudalism, but the revolutionaries in the late Qing Dynasty concentrated the oppression of colonialism and feudalism into racial hatred, which greatly reduced the requirements of the democratic revolution and limited the development of the revolution. As a result, it only overthrew the Qing Dynasty and overthrew the emperor.

	The emperor at that time, although he was just a useless figure high above, he controlled the state machinery, had the support of the royalist party and the imperial power ideology that had poisoned people for two or three thousand years, and was not so easy to overthrow. The book writes: "In the past, the emperor called himself the Son of Heaven. If someone said that the emperor was a robber and could be overthrown, others would definitely regard him as a madman. Sun Yat-sen was once a person who was regarded as a madman. On the contrary, after the Xinhai Revolution, if someone wanted to be an emperor or support others to be emperors, they would definitely be regarded as madmen." This profound change in social concepts is precisely the achievement of the Xinhai Revolution. However, the Xinhai Revolution did not continue to develop forward, but stopped at overthrowing the Qing Dynasty. Why did the revolution stop? The reason is not only that the political program of the Tongmenghui, which served as the guiding ideology of the revolution, was not a thorough democratic revolutionary program, but even this program was not fully accepted by everyone, and "originally, the Tongmenghui envisioned that after the victory of the uprising, the first step would be to organize an army, and then fight all the way, and occupy wherever they fought, and finally occupy the whole of China. However, the situation after the Wuchang Uprising was very different from the original plan. Almost all places were determined by issuing proclamations." Here, there are two questions: Why was the Wuchang Uprising so different from the original plan? Why did so many places "issue proclamations" after the sound of the cannons in Wuchang? The reason for this, in addition to the revolutionaries' failure to foresee, wanting to earn cheap victories, and the collapse of the Qing Dynasty, is that the revolutionaries were afraid of launching a deep revolution of the masses and colluding with the constitutionalists and reactionary forces to seize the fruits of the revolution. The book points out: "It can be said that Sun Yat-sen's uprisings were not based on patient work among the masses." This is the fundamental reason why the Xinhai Revolution was bound to be abandoned halfway and lead to failure.

	After the Xinhai Revolution, the May Fourth Movement, which thoroughly opposed imperialism and feudalism, was launched. What relationship did the Xinhai Revolution have with the May Fourth Movement? Many historical works have not made this question clear. The author points out the historical relationship between the two in the conclusion of this book, believing that both the failure and victory of the Xinhai Revolution "made the May Fourth Movement of 1919 inevitable." This is because "after people experienced this failure and became aware, they demanded make-up lessons, believing that only by overthrowing imperialism and feudalism could China have a way out." Moreover, people "after experiencing such an earth-shattering change, gained considerable liberation spiritually and ideologically, dared to raise questions that they did not dare to raise before the Xinhai Revolution, and were more likely to accept new revolutionary theories." Precisely because of this inherent historical relationship, especially the gradual growth of the working class, the May Fourth Movement began China's new revolution under the influence of the October Revolution. Ignoring this inherent historical relationship, one cannot truly understand the significance of the Xinhai Revolution, nor can one comprehensively understand the background of the outbreak of the May Fourth Movement.

	This book provides a relatively concise, clear, and profound analysis and discussion of the major historical event of the Xinhai Revolution. Its characteristics are obvious. The entire book implements the principle of class analysis, permeating this principle into the discussion of every historical fact. Starting from this principle, it elucidates the objective laws of the victory and failure of the Xinhai Revolution, and demonstrates that the Chinese bourgeoisie, even during the Xinhai Revolution, could not undertake the task of leading the revolution. It closely combines typical historical facts with the analysis of these historical facts, achieving the unity of historical materials and viewpoints. Currently, there are two fairly prominent phenomena in China's historical community, that is: many papers only care about piling up historical materials, and do not put forward new viewpoints based on historical materials; many papers distort historical materials, forcing them to prove their own viewpoints. Comrade Wu Yuzhang's works are powerful in opposing these two phenomena. Of course, this book has not solved all the problems in the history of the Xinhai Revolution; however, it is an important impetus for us to further study the history of this period.

    一本关于辛亥革命的新著
    陈旭麓
    新近中国人民大学出版社出版了吴玉章同志撰写的“辛亥革命”一书。这本书的篇幅不大，但是内容丰富。从经济基础到上层建筑，从政治思想领域的斗争到武装起义，从革命群众到领导人物的活动，从革命的胜利发展到妥协失败，书中都有概括的阐述。特别是对于辛亥革命史中许多关键性的问题，书中都作了比较深刻的分析和精辟的论断。
    人民群众是历史的创造者。书中对于人民群众在辛亥革命中的作用给予了极大的重视，作者写道：在辛亥革命时期，“革命派所以对革命具有信心，主要是因为广大群众的革命化”。这首先就揭示了广大群众的革命化是革命力量的泉源。二十世纪初年中国的革命派，敢于站出来革清朝的命，革皇帝的命，正是有赖于这个力量的支持和推动，尽管资产阶级小资产阶级的革命派并没有真正地认识到这一点。
    参加辛亥革命的社会成分非常复杂。何以这样复杂？书中作了这样的说明：当时，“不仅许多工人、农民和手工业者起来反抗，而且也有不少比较开明的地主阶级分子表现不安，想寻求经济上和政治上的出路。出路在哪里呢？当时封建主义已经毫无出路了。要出路只能跟资产阶级跑。所以他们中间有很多人卷入了资产阶级的政治活动，不是变成孙中山的信徒，就是变成康有为和梁启超的信徒。”由此可以看出，当时中国社会的空前动荡，阶级关系的激烈变化，不论是跟孙中山跑，还是跟康有为和梁启超跑，他们都无非是想寻找自己的出路，资本主义的出路。
    辛亥革命时期的立宪派，既反对革命，也不满意清朝政府的死硬顽固。这批人到底属于哪个阶级？他们对辛亥革命有过什么影响？这是史学界一直聚讼的问题。书中指出：“以康有为和梁启超为首的立宪派代表资产阶级右翼和一部分地主官僚”；而作为立宪派活动场所的资政院和谘议局，“是一种类似资产阶级议会的机关”。但是，在革命派要推翻清朝统治的严重斗争中，立宪派的向背也不是没有变化的。书中这样说：“谘议局的议员们虽然极大多数只是一些改良主义者，并不赞成革命，可是最后他们还是做了革命的不自觉的工具。”工具并不是他们自己甘心情愿去做的，而是清朝政府逼使他们去做的；在1909年起的两三年中，这种变化更为显著。因为清朝政府拖延立宪、借外债筑铁路等等，挡住了他们要求资本主义的出路，所以他们就出来闹，闹得也很凶，使清朝政府更加孤立。同时，革命群众加入了他们的斗争，又把斗争推向反对清朝统治的革命运动。我们知道，立宪派在政治路线上曾经和革命派壁垒森严地对立着，他们所以“最后还是做了革命的不自觉的工具”，就是由于他们也有走资本主义道路的要求，这是他们和资产阶级小资产阶级革命派的同一性。后来，革命派只看到这点同一性，尤其是为立宪派在清帝退位时表示拥护共和所迷惑，从而放弃了对他们的斗争。作者说：立宪派却“始终不忘记他们同革命派在政治上的分歧，处处提防革命派排斥他们”。这是一个极为深刻的分析，是一切革命者应引为警惕的。
    因此，立宪派所把持的谘议局，“它在革命以前，一方面削弱了革命的力量；一方面因为要求政治改革，揭露了清朝政府的腐朽无能，反而促进了革命运动的发展。在革命以后，它虽然竭力表示是共和制度的拥护者，但是因为它和旧势力在一起形成了反抗革命派的联盟，在实际上阻碍了革命运动的发展。”在这里，作者不仅辩证地论证了立宪派和辛亥革命的关系，而且特别是辩证地论证了它对辛亥革命的反动影响。这就更使人警觉到，一切改良主义者，即使如康有为、梁启超这样的改良主义者，他们所倡导的维新改良运动，在中国特殊的历史条件下，虽然曾经产生过积极的作用，但是终究还是要成为革命的对立面以至腐蚀革命的。
    革命党的政治纲领，是革命行动的指针，对于革命的发展具有重要的意义。同盟会的政治纲领是：“驱逐鞑虏，恢复中华，建立民国，平均地权”，这是大家都知道的。作者不是对这个纲领平列地叙述，而是对它作了科学的分析，他说：“同盟会的纲领是资产阶级性质的，除了推翻清朝政府以外，还主张建立民国，并且根据孙中山的建议，增加了一条平均地权。”这就使读者一看了然，同盟会的纲领，只有其中推翻清朝政府一条，是为大家所接受而要努力促其实现的。推翻清朝建立共和政府，是那时必然的趋势，但是也有些人以为只要把清朝推翻了，就可以不管建立什么样的政府。至于平均地权，更几乎只是孙中山和其他个别革命党人的纲领。因此，这个纲领的宣传，“给人印象最深的只有两点：一是反满；一是汉族祖先的光荣传统。”事实正是这样，我们现在不管是翻开同盟会的机关报——“民报”来看也好，还是翻开宣传力最大的“革命军”、“猛回头”、“警世钟”和“黄帝魂”等书来看也好，这两方面的宣传文字是最多的。虽然它鼓起了革命风暴，但是它存在着很大的弱点。书中根据这一事实分析说：“反满这个口号太简单了，它把一切的仇恨集中在满族统治者身上，其中掺杂着汉族人民的种族主义情绪，而没有真正提高全国人民的民族意识。结果放过了一个真正的民族敌人——外国侵略者。同样，对于汉族祖先的光荣传统的宣传也太简单了，没有批判、反对那长时期统治中国的汉族的封建主义，这就又放过了一个内部的大敌人，也就是支持了清朝统治的汉族封建势力。”中国的资产阶级民主革命是要彻底地反帝反封建的，但是，清末的革命派把殖民主义和封建主义的压迫集中为种族仇恨，这就大大地降低了民主革命的要求，限制了革命的发展。结果就只是推翻清朝，打倒皇帝罢了。
    那时的皇帝，虽然他只是一个高高在上的大废物，但是他掌握着国家机器，有保皇党和流毒了两三千年的皇权思想的维护，也不是那么容易被打倒的。书中写道：“从前皇帝自称为天子，如果有人说皇帝是强盗，可以打倒，别人一定把他看做疯子。孙中山就曾经是一个被人家看做疯子的人。相反，在辛亥革命以后，如果有人想做皇帝或者拥护别人做皇帝，一定也被看做疯子。”这种社会观念的深刻变化，正是辛亥革命的功绩。但是，辛亥革命并没有继续向前发展，在推翻清朝皇帝中就停止了。革命为什么会停止？其原因不仅是作为革命指导思想的同盟会的政治纲领不是彻底的民主革命纲领，就是连这个纲领也没有完整地为大家所接受，而且是“本来同盟会设想在起义胜利以后首先是组织军队，然后一路打过去，打到什么地方，就占领什么地方，最后占领全中国。但是武昌起义以后的情形同设想的大不相同，差不多所有的地方都是传檄而定的”。在这里，有这样两个问题：为什么武昌起义和原来的设想大不相同？为什么武昌的炮声一响许多地方就“传檄而定”？究其原因，除了革命派没有预见、想赚取廉价的胜利和清朝的树倒猢狲散以外，就是革命派害怕发动群众的深入革命和立宪派勾结反动势力抢夺革命果实所造成的。书中指出：“孙中山的起义可以说都不是以在群众中耐心的工作为基础的。”这就是辛亥革命必然半途而废和遭致失败的根本原因。
    辛亥革命后，掀起了彻底地反帝反封建的五四运动。辛亥革命对于五四运动究竟有过什么关系？关于这个问题，许多历史论著都是没有弄明白的。作者在这本书的结尾中指出了两者的历史关系，认为辛亥革命的失败和胜利，都“使1919年的五四运动成为不可避免”。这是因为，“人们在经历了这次失败而有了觉悟以后，就要求补课，认为只有把帝国主义和封建主义打倒，中国才有出路。”并且，人们在“经过了这样一次天翻地复的变化以后，精神上和思想上获得了相当大的解放，敢于提出辛亥革命以前不敢提出的问题，并且比较容易地接受新的革命理论。”正因为这种历史的内在的关系，特别是工人阶级的逐步壮大，所以五四运动就在十月革命的影响下开始了中国的新的革命。忽视了这种历史的内在的关系，那就不能真正地认识辛亥革命的意义，也就不能全面地认识五四运动爆发的背景。
    这本书对于辛亥革命这一重大的历史事件，进行了比较扼要、清晰和深刻的分析和论述。它的特点是明显的。全书贯彻了阶级分析的原则，把这个原则渗透在对于每一史实的论述中。从这个原则出发，它阐明了辛亥革命的胜利和失败的客观规律，论证了中国资产阶级即使在辛亥革命时期也是不能担负起领导革命的任务的。它把典型的史实和对于这些史实的分析紧密地结合起来，做到了史料和观点的统一。目前我国历史界有两个相当突出的现象，这就是：许多论文只顾堆砌史料，并不根据史料提出新的观点；许多论文曲解史料，强迫它们来证明自己的观点。吴玉章同志的著作对于反对这两种现象，都是有力量的。当然，这本书并没有解决辛亥革命史的一切问题；但是，它对于我们进一步地研究这一时期的历史是一个重要的推动。
