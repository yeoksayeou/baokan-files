Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 5th: Our correspondent reports: As the people of South Korea are fearlessly waging a struggle against the US-Lee clique, the working people of northern Korea have launched a vibrant mass movement to produce one more ton of iron, one more ton of coal, one more meter of cloth, build one more house, and transplant one more bundle of seedlings to support the just struggle of their South Korean compatriots and promote the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

In recent days, workers and staff of factories and enterprises in northern Korea have held meetings one after another, proposing new production increase targets to support the struggle of the South Korean people. Workers at the Pyongyang Textile Factory passed a resolution at a meeting held on the 4th, stating that they would produce an additional 11 million meters of cloth (the length of which is 2.5 times the distance from Pyongyang to Busan), 2,500 tons of cotton yarn, 1.5 million pairs of socks, and 1.2 million sets of underwear this year. Han Fushun, a dyeing worker whose hometown is in South Korea, said at the meeting, "The people of my hometown have ignited the flames of struggle against the US-Lee clique, and I will use all my strength to support them. The workers of our dyeing factory will process an additional 24 million meters of cloth this year to realize our determination."

Workers of the Pyongyang Central District Construction Company expressed their determination at a meeting held on the 4th to build residential buildings for 1,720 more households than originally planned this year to support the struggle of their South Korean compatriots. To achieve this goal, every worker is striving to innovate technology and increase labor productivity. Plasterer Cui Yongzhe recently completely mechanized the plastering process, increasing efficiency by 2.5 times, enabling one person to plaster 30 square meters per shift.

In order to support the patriotic struggle of the South Korean people, the working enthusiasm of the working people in northern Korea is very high. The Park Bong-hak Youth Chollima Work Team of the Giyang Machinery Factory recently reduced the processing time of a major component of a tractor from 52 man-hours to 15.6 man-hours. The Kim Ki-tae tunneling work team of the Sinchang Youth Coal Mine completed twelve days' worth of tunneling in three days. Workers in the Lee Bong-nyeo work team of the fine spinning workshop of the Guseong Textile Factory increased the number of spindles each person tended to by 1,600 in April, reaching twice the number in March. They are determined to complete twice the annual production plan before the 15th anniversary of the liberation of Korea on August 15th.

In the vast fields of northern Korea, farmers are also actively producing with fiery labor enthusiasm, determined to increase grain production to support their South Korean compatriots. Members of the Janggyo Agricultural Cooperative in Gangnam County, South Pyongan Province, launched a movement to transplant 200 pyeong (equal to one Chinese mu) of rice seedlings per person per day under the conditions of reasonable close planting, striving to transplant the seedlings in a timely manner in May to ensure a greater increase in rice production throughout the year. They hope that the vast number of unemployed compatriots and starving farmers in South Korea will be able to eat the rice they grow and share the fruits of their labor with them.

    支援南部同胞爱国斗争促进祖国和平统一
    朝鲜北部人民展开增产运动
    新华社平壤5日电　本社记者报道：在南朝鲜人民奋不顾身地进行反对美李集团的斗争的同时，朝鲜北部劳动人民展开了热火朝天的多生产一吨铁、一吨煤、一米布，多盖一幢房子、多插一兜秧的群众运动，来支援他们的南朝鲜同胞的正义斗争，促进祖国的和平统一。
    连日以来，朝鲜北部各工厂企业的职工纷纷举行集会，为支援南朝鲜人民的斗争提出了新的增产目标。平壤纺织工厂工人在4日举行的大会上通过决议，要在今年内多生产一千一百万米布（这些布的长度等于平壤到釜山的距离二点五倍），二千五百吨棉纱，一百五十万双线袜和一百二十万套内衣。故乡在南朝鲜的印染工人韩福顺在会上讲话时说，我的故乡的人们燃起了反对美李集团的斗争烽火，我要用一切力量支援他们。我们印染厂的职工今年要多加工二千四百万米布来实现我们的决心。
    平壤市中区建设公司的职工们在4日举行的集会上，表示决心要在今年比原订计划多盖供一千七百二十户居住的住宅，来支援南朝鲜同胞的斗争。为了实现这个目标，每个工人正在努力革新技术，提高劳动生产率。抹灰工崔用哲最近把抹灰工序全盘机械化了，提高效率二点五倍，一人每班能够抹灰三十平方米。
    为了支援南朝鲜人民的爱国斗争，朝鲜北部劳动人民的劳动热情十分高涨。岐阳机械工厂朴奉学青年千里马作业班最近把一种拖拉机的主要部件的加工时间由五十二工时缩短到十五点六工时。新仓青年煤矿金基泰掘进作业班三天完成了十二天的掘进量。龟城纺织工厂细纱车间李凤女作业班的工人在4月份每人看管的纱锭数提高了一千六百锭，达到3月份的两倍。她们决心要在“八·一五”朝鲜解放十五周年前夕完成全年生产计划的两倍。
    在朝鲜北部广大的田野上，农民们也正以火一样的劳动热情积极生产，决心多增产粮食来支援南朝鲜同胞。平安南道江南郡长桥农业社社员们展开了在合理密植的情况下每人每天插秧二百坪（合一华亩）的运动，争取在5月份适时地插上秧，保证全年多增产大米。他们希望南朝鲜广大的失业同胞和绝粮农民能够吃上他们种的大米，同他们共享劳动的果实。
