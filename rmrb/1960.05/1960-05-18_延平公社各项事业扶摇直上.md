The Yanping People's Commune in Nanping City, Fujian Province, born in the Great Leap Forward of 1958, shines like the rising sun. It has demonstrated great vitality in rapidly developing urban production and construction, and organizing collective life.

The Yanping People's Commune has three management districts, including twenty neighborhood committees, one farm, and one livestock farm, with a total of more than 68,000 members (including cadres and workers of units directly under the Nanping Prefectural and Municipal Party Committees and their families). After the establishment of the commune, it relied on its own efforts, starting from scratch, and successively established 231 small factories. These factories produce a wide variety of products and serve a wide range of purposes. There are mechanical repair factories, building materials factories, forest chemical factories, and other types of processing factories serving large industries; there are farm implements, pesticide, and flatbed cart factories serving agriculture; and there are fragrant oil, embroidery, bamboo curtain, knitting, and sewing processing factories serving the people's livelihood and exports. Because the commune-run factories have flexible and diverse characteristics, they can widely utilize local resources and waste materials, playing a role of "picking up the scraps" in production and vigorously supporting production and construction. When the Jianxi Hydropower Station reservoir project fully commenced, a large number of pickaxe handles, hoe handles, and various iron nails were needed. At that time, the supply from other places could not keep up, so the commune-run factories took on this production task. They rushed to produce 120,000 pickaxe handles alone, ensuring the normal construction needs of the site. The commune-run mechanical repair factory actively produced various machine parts, castings, and forgings for the Second Machine Factory. Many commune-run factories also produced a large number of various daily necessities to supply the needs of residents. Last year, the daily-use commodities supplied to the market alone amounted to 1,392 types and 1.47 million pieces. According to commune statistics, the 62 factories established last year alone produced more than 3.13 million products in one year, with a total output value of 1.21 million yuan, an increase of 15 times compared to before the commune, equivalent to 2.4 times the total industrial output value of the city in 1952. This year, with the development of commune-run industry, industrial production has soared even higher. In the first quarter alone, the industrial output value reached 1.15 million yuan, an increase of 629% compared to the same period last year, approaching the total output value of last year. After the establishment of the commune's non-staple food production base, all 281 farming households in the commune, with the cooperation and support of commune staff and residents, vigorously carried out innovation and production. Last year, they produced 6.4 million catties of vegetables, raised more than 1,200 pigs and 175 dairy cows, produced more than 500 catties of milk per day, and planted more than 39,000 fruit trees and afforested more than 2,000 mu.

While organizing and developing production, the commune also organized resident members to vigorously develop collective welfare undertakings. Up to now, the commune has established 63 public canteens, enabling 98% of street residents to participate in the canteens. These canteens, based on the principles of "making do with what is available, adapting to local conditions, taking care of special needs, and facilitating the masses," achieve "three hots" (hot dishes, hot rice, hot soup) and "six haves" (rice with dry and thin options, dishes with meat and vegetables, soup, and boiled water), with a variety of options, taking care of the needs of workers on the production front and the needs of children eating in the canteens. In order to meet the needs of collective production, the commune also organized members to establish 42 nurseries and kindergartens, taking care of 1,520 children, and established 23 service stations, 17 canteen service departments, and 46 service groups. Social service projects roughly fall into four types: the first type is repair service groups, repairing clothes, shoes, and furniture; the second type is specialized service organizations, such as temporary nurseries and simple clinics; the third type is household labor service groups, mainly providing door-to-door services, washing clothes, carrying water, caring for patients, caring for postpartum women, and buying things for postpartum women; the fourth type of organization is business agency services, mainly selling stamps and newspapers, providing catering services, and handling household registration, etc.

After the establishment of the commune, with the development of production and service undertakings, the economic outlook of the streets and the spiritual outlook of the residents have undergone great changes. In the past, women were "doing three things from morning to night: washing clothes, cooking, and taking care of children; relying entirely on husbands and children for sewing, clothing, and pocket money," and had no status politically or economically. After participating in production and construction, their buried wisdom shone brightly. At the end of last year's evaluation, 535 advanced producers and advanced workers emerged from the entire commune. The income of the vast majority of residents has generally increased, and their lives have improved. Residents' savings increased by 100% last year compared to 1958. Purchasing power has also greatly increased. With the improvement of people's economic lives, the development of cultural, educational, and health undertakings has also been faster. Now the commune has established nine primary schools with 1,552 children enrolled, and established 34 spare-time cultural schools and three spare-time normal schools.

    延平公社各项事业扶摇直上   
    创建工厂两百多个，一季度产值接近去年全年产值
    居民精神面貌发生深刻变化，全社涌现五百多先进生产者
    本报讯　在1958年大跃进中诞生的福建省南平市延平人民公社，像初升的太阳一样光芒四射。它在迅速发展城市生产建设、组织集体生活等方面，都显示了伟大的生命力。
    延平人民公社有三个管理区，包括二十个居民委员会、一个农场和一个畜牧场，社员共六万八千多人（包括南平地市委直属单位干部、职工及其家属）。公社建立后，自力更生，白手起家，陆续办起两百三十一个小型工厂。这些工厂生产内容多种多样，服务范围极为广泛。有为大工业服务的机械修配厂、建筑材料厂、林产化工厂和其他各类加工厂；有为农业服务的农具、农药和板车厂；还有为人民生活及出口服务的芳香油、刺锈、竹帘、针织、缝纫等加工厂。由于社办工厂具有灵活多样的特点，能够广泛利用当地资源和废料旧料，在生产中发挥了“拾遗补缺”的作用，有力地支援了生产建设。建溪水电站水库工程全面动工时，需要大量的洋镐柄、锄头柄和各种铁钉，当时外地供应赶不上，社办工厂就担负起这项生产任务。单是洋镐柄就突击赶制出十二万根，保证了这个工地的正常施工需要。社办机械修配厂积极为第二机器厂生产各种机器配套零件、铸件和锻件。许多社办工厂还大量生产各种生活日用品，供应居民生活需要。去年光是已供应到市场的日用商品就有一千三百九十二种、一百四十七万件。据公社统计，单是去年办起的六十二个工厂，一年中就生产了三百一十三万多件产品，总产值达到一百二十一万元，比公社化前增长十五倍，相当于1952年全市工业总产值的二点四倍。今年随着社办工业的发展，工业生产更是扶摇直上，第一季度就完成工业产值一百一十五万元，比去年同期增长629％，接近于去年全年产值。公社副食品生产基地建立后，全社二百八十一个农户在公社职工和居民协作支援下，大闹革新，大搞生产，去年就生产了六百四十万斤蔬菜，饲养了一千二百多头猪、一百七十五头奶牛，日产牛奶五百多斤，并且种植果树三万九千多株，造林二千多亩。
    在组织发展生产的同时，公社又组织居民社员大办集体福利事业。到目前为止，全社已办起公共食堂六十三个，使98％的街道居民都参加了食堂。这些食堂根据“因陋就简、因地制宜、照顾特殊、便利群众”的原则，做到“三热”（菜热、饭热、汤热）、“六有”（饭有干有稀，菜有荤有素，有汤、有开水），品种多样，既照顾生产战线上职工的需要，又照顾在食堂吃饭的孩子们的需要。为适应集体生产的需要，这个公社还组织社员办起四十二个托儿所和幼儿园，收托了一千五百二十个儿童，并办起二十三个服务站，十七个食堂服务部和四十六个服务小组。社会服务项目大致有四种类型：第一种是修补服务组，补衣服、补鞋、修补家具用具；第二种是专业性服务组织，如临时托儿所、简易治疗所；第三种是家务劳动服务组，主要是上门服务、洗衣、挑水、照顾病人、照顾产妇、为产妇代买东西等；第四种组织是经营代办业务，主要是代售邮票、书报、代办伙食、代办户口等。
    公社建立以后，随着生产、服务事业的发展，街道经济面貌和居民精神面貌都起了很大的变化。过去妇女是“从早到晚三件事，洗衣煮饭抱孩子，针线花布零用钱，全靠丈夫和孩子”，政治上经济上都没有地位。参加生产建设后，她们被埋没的智慧放出了光彩。去年年底评比，全社就涌现出五百三十五名先进生产者和先进工作者。广大居民收入普遍增加，生活得到了改善。居民的储蓄去年比1958年增加一倍。购买力也有很大提高。随着人们经济生活的改善，文教卫生事业的发展也更快了。现在全社已办了九所小学，入学儿童达一千五百五十二人，并建立三十四所业余文化学校和三所业余师范。
