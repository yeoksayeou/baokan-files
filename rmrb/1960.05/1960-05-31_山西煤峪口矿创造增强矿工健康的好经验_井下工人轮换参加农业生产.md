Shanxi Meiyukou Mine Creates Good Experiences in Enhancing Miners' Health
    Underground Workers Rotate to Participate in Agricultural Production

    (Our report) Shanxi Datong Mining Bureau's Meiyukou Mine has implemented a combination of above-ground and underground work, and a combination of mining and agriculture, organizing weaker coal miners to participate in agricultural production, which has played a significant role in ensuring workers' health and increasing the production of non-staple foods.

    Since 1959, the Meiyukou Mine has implemented a system of rotating shifts between above-ground and underground work, and arranging personnel in poor health to participate in agricultural production. Last year alone, the mine transferred more than ninety strong laborers from above-ground construction and other departments to work underground, replacing more than sixty miners who were assigned to above-ground labor. For some miners who were not suitable for continuing underground labor but did not yet meet retirement conditions, they were arranged to work above ground as cleaners, sanitation workers, or warehouse keepers, performing light labor. For some miners suffering from occupational diseases or other chronic illnesses, they were mainly given treatment and rest, and participated in agricultural labor at the mine's non-staple food base, such as raising fish, growing vegetables, flowers, chickens, and pigs. This enabled them to quickly recover their health.

    The mine determined the form and duration of agricultural labor for each miner based on their specific situation, with good results. Last year, eighteen miners who had previously suffered from arthritis returned to the mine and resumed operating drilling machines after only ten months of recuperation and agricultural labor training.

    The Meiyukou Mine's organization of coal miners to participate in agricultural labor on a rotational basis not only solved the problem of placing sick workers and found a good way to quickly restore miners' health but also developed the entire mining area's non-staple food production and other welfare undertakings.

    The Meiyukou Mine's implementation of combining above-ground and underground work, mining and agriculture, and organizing miners to participate in agricultural labor on a rotational basis has received the attention of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee. The Provincial Party Committee believes that this method not only enhances the miners' health but is also one of the methods of implementing "both worker and farmer," which has far-reaching significance in shortening the differences between workers and farmers and strengthening the relationship between workers and farmers. Therefore, it has been decided to promote it widely in the province's coal mines, chemical systems, and mechanical forging and other production departments with high labor intensity and less favorable working conditions. The Shanxi Provincial Coal Mine Administration has instructed all state-owned coal mines in the province to establish contact with nearby people's communes and promote this experience within this year.

### 山西煤峪口矿创造增强矿工健康的好经验  井下工人轮换参加农业生产

    山西煤峪口矿创造增强矿工健康的好经验
    井下工人轮换参加农业生产
    本报讯　山西大同矿务局煤峪口矿实行井上井下结合、矿农结合，组织体弱的煤矿工人参加农业生产，对保障工人身体健康，增产副食品起了很大作用。
    从1959年起，煤峪口矿就实行了井上井下轮班生产和身体不够好的人员参加农业生产的办法。去年一年，这个矿从井上土建等部门抽调了九十多名壮工下井替换了六十多名矿工上井劳动。对于部分不适于继续下井劳动、但又不够退休条件的矿工，安排在井上担任清洁工、卫生工或看仓库等轻微劳动；对于部分患有职业病或其他慢性病的矿工，让他们以治疗、休养为主，参加本矿的副食品基地的农业劳动，如养鱼、种菜、种花、养鸡、养猪等。这样，就使他们能迅速恢复健康。
    这个矿根据每个矿工的具体情况，确定每人参加农业劳动的形式和劳动时间，效果很好。去年有十八名原来患关节炎的矿工，只经过了十个月的疗养和农业劳动锻炼，就回到了井下重新拿起了钻机。
    煤峪口矿组织煤矿工人轮换参加农业劳动，不仅解决了病员的安置问题，找到了使矿工迅速恢复健康的好办法，而且还发展了全矿区的副食品生产和其他福利事业。
    煤峪口矿实行井上井下结合，矿农结合，组织矿工轮换参加农业劳动，受到中共山西省委的重视。省委认为，这个办法不仅增强了矿工的身体健康，而且是实行亦工亦农的方法之一，具有缩短工农差别，密切工农关系等深远意义。因此，决定在全省煤矿、化工系统和机械锻造等劳动强度较大、劳动条件不太好的生产部门普遍推广。山西省煤矿管理局已指示全省所有国营煤矿，在今年内至少要有一个坑口同附近人民公社建立联系，推行这一经验。
