Xinhua News Agency, May 28th: Our reporter reports: In the past week, U.S. imperialism's warships have successively intruded into our country's territorial waters in the Dongyin and Haitan areas of Fujian Province three times, and U.S. military aircraft have successively intruded into our country's airspace in the Shantou, Shanwei, and Xisha Islands areas of Guangdong Province four times. In this week, the U.S. aggressors have also intensified war activities in the Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu areas. The U.S. imperialism's sinister face of being determined to be hostile to the Chinese people and undermining peace in Asia and the world has become even more clearly exposed.

On May 26th, U.S. imperialism "formally transferred" a batch of F-104 jet fighters to the Chiang Kai-shek air force at an air force base in central Taiwan. At the "transfer ceremony," Dou En, head of the U.S. military aid advisory group in Taiwan, spoke on behalf of the U.S. government, clamoring wildly that "the U.S. government's purpose in transferring F-104 fighters to its allies (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek clique) is to defeat Communist aggression." At the same time, propaganda materials about the performance of the F-104 aircraft, provided by the U.S. military to the Chiang gang's propaganda organs, also clamored that these U.S. aircraft, which "can carry atomic bombs," "with Taiwan as a base, can attack the southeastern half of the mainland," blatantly carrying out war intimidation against our people.

Chiang's navy "Commander-in-Chief" Li Yuxi announced on the 24th that the United States was about to hand over a batch of new amphibious tanks and landing craft to the Chiang army's Marine Corps. Cook, the former commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, who is carrying out war conspiracy activities in Taiwan, also inspected Chiang Kai-shek's navy and Marine Corps in southern Taiwan on the 24th. On the 27th, the U.S. aggressors also organized the Chiang army's naval forces to conduct military exercises in military port areas such as Zuoying and Keelung in Taiwan. According to "Pan Asia News Agency," under the planning of the U.S. aggressors, Chiang Kai-shek's army, navy, and air force will also hold "large-scale military offensive and defensive exercises." This news revealed that the planned exercises are "related to the recent tense situation in the Taiwan Strait" created by the United States.

The U.S. military command in Taiwan and the U.S. military aid advisory group in Taiwan have also recently instigated the Chiang army to conduct tense war preparations in Penghu, Kinmen, Matsu, and other places. According to Taiwan newspapers on the 23rd, the Chiang army units in Kinmen and Matsu "have entered a state of emergency preparedness." U.S. Army Transportation Agency Director Major General Bessen also rushed to Kinmen on the 24th, contacted American military advisers on the island, carried out conspiracy activities, and inspected the logistics and transportation facilities of the Chiang army on the island.

    美帝国主义决心与中国人民为敌
    又在台湾海峡地区加紧备战挑衅活动
    新华社28日讯　本社记者报道：最近一个星期，美帝国主义的军舰接连三次侵犯我国福建省东引、海坛地区的领海，美国军用飞机接连四次侵犯我国广东省汕头、汕尾和西沙群岛等地的领空。在这一星期，美国侵略者还在台、澎、金、马地区加紧进行战争活动。美帝国主义决心与中国人民为敌、破坏亚洲和世界和平的罪恶面目，更清楚地暴露出来。
    美帝国主义26日在台湾中部空军基地把一批F—104型喷气战斗机“正式移交”给蒋介石空军。在举行“移交典礼”时，美国驻台湾军事援助顾问团团长窦恩代表美国政府致词，他猖狂地叫嚣说，“美国政府把F—104型战斗机移交给盟邦（指蒋介石集团）的目的，是打败共产党的侵略”。在这同时，由美国军方供给蒋帮宣传机构发布的关于F—104型飞机性能的宣传材料上，还叫嚷说，这种“可以携带原子弹”的美国飞机，“以台湾作基地，大陆东南半壁皆在其攻击范围内”，公然对我国人民进行战争恫吓。
    蒋军海军“总司令”黎玉玺在24日宣布，美国即将把一批新式的水陆两用战车和登陆艇交给蒋军海军陆战队使用。正在台湾进行战争阴谋活动的前美国第七舰队司令库克，也在24日到台湾南部视察了蒋介石的海军和海军陆战队。27日，美国侵略者还在台湾左营和基隆等军港地区，组织蒋军海军部队举行了军事演习。据“泛亚社”消息，在美国侵略者的策划下，蒋介石的陆、海、空军部队还要举行“大规模的军事攻防演习”。这则消息透露，计划中的演习与配合美国制造“台湾海峡的最近紧张局势有关”。
    侵台美军司令部和美国驻台湾军事援助顾问团最近还指使蒋军在澎湖、金门、马祖等地进行紧张的备战活动。据台湾报纸23日消息，金门、马祖的蒋军部队“业已进入紧急备战状态”。美国陆军运输署长贝森少将也在24日赶往金门，与岛上的美国军事顾问人员接触，进行阴谋活动，并且视察了岛上蒋军的后勤和运输设施。
