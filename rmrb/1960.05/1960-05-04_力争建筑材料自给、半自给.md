    Strive for Self-Sufficiency and Semi-Self-Sufficiency in Building Materials
    With the development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, as well as production and construction, all sectors are increasing their demand for building materials. There may be two attitudes toward solving the building materials problem. One attitude is to go all out, aim high, and insist on implementing the policy of "self-reliance, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and vigorously developing diversified operations," actively increasing production and practicing economy, and comprehensively utilizing various building materials. This is a positive and revolutionary attitude. The other attitude is "shrinking back and worrying endlessly," not daring to boldly implement the policy of self-reliance and vigorously developing diversified operations. This is a new right-leaning conservative ideology of not daring to win and not daring to leap forward. They still have the idea of simply relying on state allocation of materials, not "finding rice to cook," but "waiting for rice to cook" - waiting for allocation, waiting for collaboration; always thinking that self-initiated raw material production is a distant water that cannot quench a present fire, and therefore, they are unwilling to take immediate action everywhere, mobilize the masses, and overcome difficulties; instead, they look upwards and even blame fate. In this way, they are bound to "miss the opportunity and regret being late." In order to achieve regional self-sufficiency, partial self-sufficiency, and semi-self-sufficiency in building materials, we must thoroughly criticize these right-leaning conservative ideas and resolutely move towards the path of developing comprehensive joint enterprises.

### 力争建筑材料自给、半自给

    力争建筑材料自给、半自给
    随着技术革新和技术革命运动以及生产建设的发展，各行各业都增加了对建筑材料的需求量。解决建筑材料问题可能有两种态度。一种态度是鼓足干劲、力争上游，坚持执行“自力更生，土洋并举，大搞多种经营”的方针，积极主动地增产节约和综合利用各种建筑材料。这是一种积极的革命的态度。另一种态度：就是“畏缩不前、无穷忧虑”，不敢大胆执行自力更生、大搞多种经营的方针。这是一种不敢胜利，不敢跃进的新的右倾保守思想。他们仍有单纯依赖国家调拨材料的想法，不是“找米下锅”，而是“等米下锅”——等调拨，等协作；总认为自搞原材料生产是远水不能救近火，因之处处不愿立即动手，发动群众，克服困难；而是眼睛向上，甚至怨天尤人。这样，势必造成“坐失良机，后悔来迟”。  为了达到建筑材料的地区自给、部分自给、半自给，必须反透这些右倾保守思想，必须坚定地走向综合性联合企业方向发展的道路。
