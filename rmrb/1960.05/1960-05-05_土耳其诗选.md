    Selection of Turkish Poems

    Hold On! by Melih Cevdet
    Look, the day has come again, a day is born anew, everything starts all over again.
    This is the sun, these are your hands, these are your boots, these are your clothes.
    Again, work and worries: everything starts again, you wake up still unemployed, you are hungry and crave bread...
    But, Melih, don't surrender, everything starts all over again.

    Future Days
    In the future we will show our skills,
    Happiness trembles in my heart.
    Soon, soon, it won't be long,
    The bright sun will shine all over the globe.

    Song of Happiness by Oktay Rıfat
    He asked me to sing for him.
    I sang him a song of poverty.
    He asked me to sing a song of pride, a song of victory.
    I sang him a song of poverty.
    He asked me to sing a happy song, a song of happiness.
    But I sang him the most beautiful song of poverty.

    Freedom by Adnan Teyenz
    The earth is not supported by a few pillars,
    But by the hands of us workers!
    The muscles on our arms,
    Grow stronger year by year.
    No one can stop this development.
    Long live freedom!
              [Translated by Lu Yong]
      (Editor's Note) These are some poems by contemporary Turkish poets. From these poems, we can feel the tragic lives of the Turkish people under the oppression of internal and external reactionaries, and their strong determination to resist oppression and fight for the future of their motherland.

    土耳其诗选
    顶住！梅里赫·哲夫岱特瞧，白天又来了，一个白天又诞生了，一切都从头开始了。这是太阳，这是你的双手，这是你的皮靴，这是你的衣服。又是工作和烦恼：一切都重新开始了，你醒来还是一个失业者，你忍饥挨饿，渴望着面包……但是，梅里赫，不投降，一切都从头开始了。
    未来的日子在未来我们将大显身手，快乐颤动在我的心头。快了，快了，要不了多久了，光明的太阳将照遍全球。
    幸福歌奥克泰·里发特他要求我为他歌唱。我为他唱了一支贫穷的歌。他要求我唱一支骄傲的歌，胜利的歌。我为他唱了一支贫穷的歌。他要求我唱一支快乐的歌，幸福的歌。我却为他唱了一支最美妙的贫穷的歌呵。
    自由阿德南·泰恩兹大地不是靠几个台柱子支撑，而是靠我们工人的双手！我们手臂上的筋肉，一年比一年壮实。这种发育谁也不能阻止。自由万岁！
              〔卢永译〕
      （编辑附记）这是土耳其当代诗人的一些诗篇。从这些诗篇里，我们可以感到土耳其人民在内外反动派压榨下所过的悲惨的生活，以及他们反抗压迫为祖国的未来而奋斗的坚强决心。
