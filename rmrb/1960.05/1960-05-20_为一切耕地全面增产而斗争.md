    Strive for Overall Increased Production on All Cultivated Land

    In agricultural production, organizing low-yield fields to catch up with high-yield fields, and high-yield fields to achieve even higher yields, will gradually lead to overall increased production between fields and regions on a large scale. This is of utmost importance for increasing the yield per unit area and the total output of all cultivated land.

    As everyone knows, in the development of agricultural production, within the same region, some rice fields can produce more than 1,000 jin per mu, while others only produce 300 to 400 jin per mu; some cotton fields can produce more than 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu, while others only produce 30 to 40 jin per mu; staple foods can yield more than 1,000 jin per mu, while coarse grains only yield 100 to 200 jin per mu. This phenomenon is detrimental to the high-speed growth of total agricultural output. In many areas, locally, the crops look good, and the yield per unit area is high, but when calculated as an average for the entire region, the average yield of the total area still does not increase much. The reason is that it has not been possible to achieve balanced increased production on a large scale. If we can enable the backward to catch up with the advanced, transform small-scale increased production into large-scale increased production, raise the output of backward areas to the average advanced level, and raise the output level of slower-growing coarse grains to the level of faster-growing staple foods, the situation will be greatly different, and the total agricultural output will increase rapidly.

    Some people believe that land varies in fertility, labor varies in quantity, fertilizer varies in sufficiency, land varies in proximity, and cadres vary in strength, so conditions are different everywhere, and therefore production cannot develop in a balanced way. This view is wrong. The differences in objective conditions such as land quality and labor availability can indeed lead to different results in production. However, we must look at the issue dialectically. All conditions are not fixed and immutable. And under certain circumstances, the subjective conditions of people play a decisive role. Comrade Mao Zedong often taught that the strength of the people is the greatest, the people are the creators of history, and as long as we rely on the people, we have no difficulties that we cannot overcome, and we can achieve victory in all aspects. Since liberation, especially since the Great Leap Forward, great achievements have been created on the agricultural front. Many areas that previously had very bad conditions and backward production have now become areas with very good conditions and advanced production. Zao yang County in Hubei Province used to be a barren land, where "a knife in sunny weather, a mess in rainy weather," and the grain yield per mu was only dozens or hundreds of jin. However, under the leadership of the Party, and through the hard struggle of the people of the county, the situation has rapidly changed, and the grain yield per mu has increased to several hundred jin. Zhangbei County in the Dam region of Hebei Province has historically had extremely low grain yields, and the people's lives have been very difficult. The people of the county have risen up to change the unfavorable natural conditions of the area, and last year the average yield per mu increased by 20% compared to the previous year. Such examples are endless throughout the country. This illustrates a truth: all unfavorable conditions can be turned into favorable conditions in the face of the people's struggle.

    Some people say: "Ten fingers can never be the same length. As you advance, others also advance, so it is never possible to achieve balanced increased production on a large scale." We believe that this sentence is only half right. The balanced development of production we are talking about is not asking for absolute balance, it is not asking for the yield of all regions, all fields, and all crops to be equal forever. In the development process of all things in the world, imbalance is constant and absolute, and balance is temporary and relative. The development of things from imbalance to balance, and then from balance to imbalance, is a repeated and continuous process. Each repetition indicates that things are developing to a new and higher stage. Our task is to correctly understand and apply this law, so that the backward can catch up with the advanced, and at the same time, make the advanced even more advanced, thereby promoting the faster development of the entire production. We hope that the production level of various regions and various types of fields will reach the average advanced level in a certain period of time, and strive to greatly increase the output of low-yield areas and low-yield fields, and eliminate as much as possible the serious imbalance in yield differences, so that the overall production level will be greatly improved. Of course, the approximate balance that has just been achieved will soon show new imbalances, some regions will be more advanced, and some regions will be relatively lagging behind. At that time, the relatively backward regions will be required to catch up with the advanced regions, and continue to work hard to achieve a new approximate balance, and our entire production will continue to develop to a higher level. Many facts prove that it is entirely possible to achieve balanced increased production on a large scale. In 1959, a large number of counties (cities) across the country had already achieved the targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program for the average yield per mu of grain and cotton. A prominent feature of these areas is that they have achieved balanced increased production on a large scale. Last year, Cenxi County in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region produced an average of 685 jin per mu of late rice on 270,000 mu, an increase of 66% compared to 1958. The largest increase in production was in large areas of low-yield fields, distant fields, and mountain-gully fields. The lowest yield per mu of the 100,000 mu of low-yield fields transformed throughout the county was 550 jin, and the highest reached 1,000 jin. Facts have also proved that not only can balanced increased production be achieved on a large scale under normal circumstances, but also in the event of severe natural disasters. In 1959, Hubei Province suffered a severe drought that had not been seen in more than 70 years. Ponds dried up and rivers stopped flowing. However, under the leadership of the Party, the people of Hubei Province exerted soaring enthusiasm, and not only did the entire province achieve a great agricultural harvest, but many areas still achieved increased production on a large scale. For example, the average yield per mu of the 24,000 mu of medium rice planted in Yingshan County was nearly 800 jin, the average yield per mu of the more than 90,000 mu of double-cropping rice in Hanyang County reached more than 1,150 jin, the average yield per mu of the more than 70,000 mu of cotton in Jiukou People's Commune in Zhongxiang County was more than 150 jin of ginned cotton, and the average yield per mu of the 1,140 mu of corn in Xingshan County was more than 800 jin. These are all good proofs.

    Of course, to achieve overall increased production on all cultivated land and achieve balanced increased production on a large scale is not easy. To achieve this goal, much hard and in-depth work must be done. Balanced increased production on a large scale is essentially a movement to promote advanced experience, and it is also a competition movement for the backward to catch up with the advanced. Therefore, the leadership must learn to use the leadership method of grasping both ends and bringing along the middle. On the one hand, it is necessary to continuously summarize and vigorously promote the advanced experience of advanced models, plant red flags on a large scale, establish pacesetters widely, and strive to turn advanced experience into the wealth of the whole people. On the other hand, it is necessary to thoroughly transform backward areas, launch a widespread mass movement to learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and surpass the advanced, and do everything possible to help backward areas catch up with advanced areas. Helping backward areas catch up with advanced areas is currently the most pressing issue in the movement for balanced production on a large scale. According to surveys in various places, each commune has a small number of backward production teams, and each production team has a small number of backward production sub-teams. The main reasons for the backwardness of these teams are weak leadership, organizations that have not been rectified, or a poor work style, and the enthusiasm of the masses has not been fully brought into play. Therefore, in the work of transforming backward areas, it is first necessary to strengthen the leadership of the Party. Within a certain period of time, the Party leadership should concentrate its efforts on helping the work in backward areas, including establishing work bases in backward areas, sending more capable cadres, deeply mobilizing the masses, rectifying organizations and the work style of cadres, and so on. In this work, it is necessary to rely closely on the masses, find out the situation in various backward areas, and prescribe the right medicine according to different situations to transform them. In this way, the work of transforming backward areas can be carried out quickly and well.

    The characteristic of agricultural production is that one link is linked to another, and the quality of each link will affect the entire production. In the movement for balanced increased production on a large scale, it is necessary to grasp every link. From the production process, it is necessary to focus on the basic links of production preparation, sowing, management, and harvesting. Each crop has its own different key links, such as rice's "density" (reasonable close planting), "strength" (strong seedlings, timely early sowing), "fertilizer," and "management," and cotton's "early" (timely early sowing, one-time full seedlings), "density," "fertilizer," "deep" (deep plowing), "management" (cultivation), and "water" (overcoming drought and flood), etc. These all require the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture to be implemented practically. Every link must be grasped tightly, ruthlessly, practically, and thoroughly, and a moment of relaxation will cause losses to production. Vigorously developing high-yield fields and cadres taking the lead in planting experimental fields has an important role in achieving balanced increased production on a large scale. Cadres should go to the most backward areas to vigorously develop experimental fields, experiment with the most backward crops, create high-yield fields, and closely combine the planting of high-yield experimental fields with large-scale increased production. This can set an example, create experience, and lead the masses to move forward rapidly. Balanced increased production on a large scale is a very complex task. It requires leaders at all levels to make comprehensive plans for their regions, so that they can catch up with the advanced quickly, systematically, and in a planned manner, and make the advanced even more advanced, so that the entire production can develop in a balanced way at a higher level.

    Now, the situation on the national agricultural production front is very good, and there are many favorable conditions for achieving overall increased production on all cultivated land. The power of the people's communes has become even stronger, the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture has become more deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and the experience of striving for a great leap forward in agricultural production is richer. With these favorable conditions, plus our practical efforts, we will definitely be able to achieve balanced increased production on a large scale and achieve better and more comprehensive continuous leap forward in agricultural production.

### 为一切耕地全面增产而斗争

    为一切耕地全面增产而斗争
    在农业生产中，组织低产田赶高产田，高产田更高产，在大面积土地上，逐步实现田与田、地区与地区间的全面增产。这对于提高全部耕地的单位面积产量和总产量有着极为重要的意义。
    大家知道，在农业生产的发展中，在同一地区内，有的水稻每亩能产一千多斤，而有的每亩只产三、四百斤；有的棉花每亩能产皮棉一百多斤，而有的每亩只产三、四十斤；主粮每亩产一千多斤，而杂粮每亩却只产一、二百斤。这种现象不利于农业总产量的高速度增长。有不少地区，从局部看，庄稼很好，单位面积产量很高，但如整个地区平均计算，总面积的平均产量仍然增长不大，原因就在于没有能够在大面积上实现平衡增产。如果能使落后赶上先进，使小面积增产变成大面积增产，把落后地区的产量提高到平均先进水平，把增长较慢的杂粮产量水平提高到增长较快的主粮产量水平，情况就大大不同了，农业总产量就会迅速提高。
    有人认为，土地有肥有瘦，劳力有多有少，肥料有足有缺，土地有近有远，干部有强有弱，各地条件不一样，因此，生产就不可能平衡发展。这种看法是错误的。土地好坏、劳力多少等等客观条件不同，的确可能给生产带来不同结果。但是，我们必须辩证地看问题。一切条件都不是固定不变的。而在一定情况下起决定作用的则是人的主观条件。毛泽东同志经常教导说，人民群众的力量是最伟大的，人民群众是历史的创造者，只要依靠人民群众，我们就没有克服不了的困难，我们就可以取得一切方面的胜利。解放以来，特别是大跃进以来，在农业战线上创造了伟大的成就。很多过去条件很坏、生产落后的地区，现在变成了条件很好，生产先进的地区了。湖北省枣阳县过去是“天晴一把刀，下雨一团糟”的岗地，每亩粮食产量不过几十斤、百把斤，但是，在党的领导下，经过全县人民的艰苦奋斗，面貌迅速改观，粮食亩产量提高到几百斤。河北省坝上的张北县，历来粮食产量极低，人民生活很苦。全县人民奋起改变当地不利的自然条件，去年每亩平均产量比前年提高了二成。这样的事例全国各地是层出不穷的。这就说明了一个真理：一切不利的条件在人民斗争面前，是可以走向它的反面，变为有利的条件的。
    有人说：“十个指头，永远不能一般长，你前进了，别人也前进，所以永远不能实现大面积平衡增产。”我们认为，这句话只说对了一半。我们所说的生产的平衡发展，并不是要求绝对的平衡，并不是要求一切地区、一切田、一切作物的产量都永远相等。世界上一切事物在发展过程中，不平衡是经常的、绝对的，平衡是暂时的、相对的。事物的发展由不平衡到平衡，再由平衡到不平衡，是一个反复不断的过程，每次反复，都表明事物发展到一个新的更高的阶段。我们的任务就在于正确地认识并运用这一规律，使落后赶上先进，同时使先进更先进，从而推动整个生产更快地发展。我们希望各个地区、各类田的生产水平在一定时期达到平均先进水平，努力使低产区和低产田的产量大大提高，尽可能消除产量相差悬殊的严重不平衡现象，这样总的生产水平就会大大提高一步。当然，刚刚达到的大体上的平衡，很快又会出现新的不平衡，有的地区更先进了，有的地区比较起来又落在后面了。那时又要求比较落后的地区赶上先进地区，继续努力去实现新的大体上的平衡，我们整个生产就是这样不断地向更高的水平发展。许多事实证明，实现大面积平衡增产是完全可能的。1959年全国已经有一大批县（市）的粮食和棉花平均亩产量达到了全国农业发展纲要规定的指标，这些地区的一个突出的特点，就是实现了大面积平衡增产。广西僮族自治区岑溪县二十七万亩晚稻，去年平均亩产六百八十五斤，比1958年增产66％。其中增产最多的是大面积的低产田、远田和山冲田。全县经过改造的十万亩低产田，最低的亩产五百五十斤，最高的达到一千斤。事实还证明，不仅在一般情况下可以实现大面积平衡增产，即是在严重的自然灾害的情况下，也可以实现大面积平衡增产。1959年湖北省遭受了七十多年来未有的大旱灾，堰塘干涸，河水断流，但是在党的领导下，湖北省人民发挥了冲天的干劲，不仅全省获得农业大丰收，而且很多地区仍然实现了大面积增产。例如英山县种的二万四千多亩中稻，平均亩产将近八百斤，汉阳县九万多亩双季稻，每亩平均产量达到了一千一百五十多斤，钟祥县旧口人民公社七万多亩棉花，平均每亩产皮棉一百五十多斤，兴山县有一千一百四十亩玉米，每亩平均产量八百多斤。这些都是很好的证明。
    当然，要使一切耕地都全面增产，做到大面积平衡增产，并不是轻易就能做到的，要达到这个目标，必须进行许多艰苦深入的工作。大面积平衡增产实质上是一个推广先进经验的运动，也是一个落后赶先进的竞赛运动。因此领导上必须学会运用抓两头带中间的领导方法。一方面要不断地总结和大力推广先进典型的先进经验，大插红旗，广树标兵，力求把先进经验变成全民的财富。另一方面，又要彻底改造落后地区，开展一个广泛的学先进赶先进超先进的群众运动，千方百计地帮助落后地区赶上先进地区。而帮助落后地区赶上先进地区正是当前大面积平衡生产运动中最迫切的问题。据各地调查，每个公社都有少数落后生产队，每个生产队都有少数落后生产小队，这些队落后的原因主要是领导薄弱，组织没有整顿或作风不好，广大群众的积极性没有充分发挥出来。因此，在改造落后地区的工作中，首先必须加强党的领导，在一定的时期内，党的领导应该集中力量帮助落后地区的工作，包括在落后地区建立工作基点，加派得力干部，深入发动群众，整顿组织和干部作风，等等。在这项工作中，必须紧紧依靠群众，摸清各种落后地区的情况，根据不同情况，对症下药，加以改造。这样就能使改造落后地区的工作进行得又快又好。
    农业生产的特点是一环扣一环，每一环节的好坏对整个生产都会产生影响。在大面积平衡增产运动中，必须抓住每一个环节。从生产过程来说，就是要抓好生产准备、播种、管理、收获这几个基本环节。每一种作物又有自己的不同的关键性环节，如水稻的“密”（合理密植）、“壮”（壮秧、适时早播）、“肥”、“管”，棉花的“早”（适时早播，一次全苗）、“密”、“肥”、“深”（深耕）、“管”（中耕）、“水”（战胜旱、涝）等等，这些都要求按照农业“八字宪法”切实地加以贯彻执行。对每个环节都必须抓紧、抓狠、抓实、抓到底，松一口气都会给生产造成损失。大搞丰产方和干部带头种试验田，对实现大面积平衡增产有重要的作用。干部应该到最落后的地区去大搞试验田，哪种作物最落后，就去试验哪种作物，创造高产田，并把种高产试验田与大面积增产紧密结合起来，这样可以树立榜样，创造经验，带领群众迅速前进。大面积平衡增产是一件十分复杂的工作，它要求各级领导对本地区作出全面规划，以便有计划、有步骤、迅速地使落后赶上先进，先进的更加先进，使整个生产在更高的水平上平衡发展。
    现在，全国农业生产战线上的形势很好，实现一切耕地都全面增产的有利条件很多。人民公社的威力已经更加强大，农业“八字宪法”已经更加深入人心，争取农业生产大跃进的经验更加丰富。有了这些有利条件，再加上我们的切实努力，就一定能够实现大面积平衡增产，实现农业生产更好更全面的持续跃进。
