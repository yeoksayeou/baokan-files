Post-Editing Notes:
Everyone Should Support Agricultural Production
"Everyone should support agricultural production!" This slogan is resonating enthusiastically in various industrial and mining enterprises and departments in many cities. This special page we have compiled today reflects some glimpses of this magnificent wave of support for agriculture. From the three "Party Secretary's Notes," you can see a vigorous movement of the whole party and the entire people to accelerate agricultural technological transformation is unfolding in all walks of life. So, urban readers, what are you prepared to use to support our farmer brothers?

    “大家都来支援农业生产！”这个口号，正在许多城市的各工矿企业，各个部门热烈地回响着。我们今天编的这个专页，就是反映这个波澜壮阔的支援农业浪潮的一些点滴。从三篇“党委书记手记”里，你能看出一个轰轰烈烈、全党全民动手加速农业技术改造的运动，正在各行各业展开。那么，城市的读者同志们，你准备用什么去支援我们的农民兄弟呢？
