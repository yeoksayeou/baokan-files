Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 16th May: The Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party held a meeting from May 11th to 13th to discuss the political situation. The meeting agreed with the policy direction taken by the party's leadership in the recent Italian cabinet crisis, adopted the report presented by General Secretary Togliatti at the meeting, and in the final resolution, determined the Italian Communist Party's position in the current situation.

In his report, Togliatti pointed out that the main tasks of the Italian Communists at present are: to fight for the overthrow of the Tambroni Christian Democratic government supported by the neo-fascist party, and to fight against war provocateurs and for the easing of the international situation and for peace.

When talking about the international situation, Togliatti strongly condemned the United States for its bandit-like and disgraceful act of invading Soviet airspace in direct preparation for war. Togliatti said, "This bandit act of the American plane and its destruction first discredited the American warmongers and militarist groups, and also proved that there are now people in the world who can give them the punishment they deserve."

Togliatti also mentioned other instances of the West obstructing the easing of the international situation, including the Western countries' lack of sincerity in disarmament negotiations, which resulted in no progress, the United States' announcement of the resumption of underground nuclear tests, and France's continued colonial war in Algeria. Adenauer was arrogant and self-important, and the North Atlantic Group made a decision in Istanbul that it was unwilling to reach an agreement on the Berlin and German issues. Togliatti pointed out that the workers and democratic people of the whole world must rise up and fight to prevent the process of international détente from stagnating.

Togliatti pointed out that the collapse of the Syngman Rhee terrorist regime was a heavy blow to the U.S. ruling system in South Korea, and the Turkish Menderes regime also suffered a heavy blow from the people's movement. "These huge people's movements are a new fact. These movements prove that discontent is universal in countries with reactionary regimes supported by the reactionary forces of the North Atlantic Group."

Togliatti finally pointed out that the Italian political crisis is an aspect of the struggle unfolding throughout the world between the leading groups of the big monopoly capital that supports reactionary policies and the Cold War, and the democratic people. In order to prevent reactionary conspiracies, it is necessary to vigorously develop mass movements on the basis of a program of economic and political innovation, so that all democratic forces can cooperate most broadly.

The final resolution adopted by the meeting called on the entire party to do its best to develop the working class's movement to achieve demands for rights and economic and political demands.

The resolution pointed out: The open provocative actions of the imperialist forces show that peace still faces extremely serious threats. To fight against this threat is the urgent task of the moment.

    陶里亚蒂在意共中央会议上作报告
    动员广大群众同帝国主义斗争
    谴责美机侵犯苏联及美国政府的战争政策
    据新华社16日讯　罗马消息：意大利共产党中央委员会5月11日至13日举行会议，讨论政治局势。会议同意党的领导机构在意大利最近的内阁危机中所采取的政策方针，通过了总书记陶里亚蒂在会上提出的报告，并在最后决议中确定了意大利共产党在当前形势中所采取的立场。
    陶里亚蒂在作报告时指出，意大利共产党人当前主要的任务是：为打倒由新法西斯党所支持的塔姆布罗尼的天主教民主党政府而斗争，为反对战争挑拨者和争取和缓国际局势和和平而斗争。
    陶里亚蒂在谈到国际形势时强烈谴责美国为实施战争的直接准备工作而侵犯苏联领空的这种强盗式的可耻行动。陶里亚蒂说，“美国飞机这种强盗勾当和它的毁灭，首先使美国战争贩子和军国主义集团威望扫地，同时也证明了现在世界上有人能够给予他们以应有的惩罚。”
    陶里亚蒂还谈到了西方其他阻挠国际局势缓和的事例，包括西方国家对裁军谈判毫无诚意从而使谈判没有取得成果，美国已经宣布恢复地下核试验，法国继续在阿尔及利亚进行殖民战争。阿登纳狂妄自大，北大西洋集团在伊斯坦布尔作出了不愿在柏林和德国问题取得协议的决定等。陶里亚蒂就此指出，全世界的工人群众和民主分子必须起来斗争，使国际和缓的进程不致停顿。
    陶里亚蒂指出，李承晚恐怖政权的倒台是美国统治体系在南朝鲜受到的一次沉重打击，土耳其曼德列斯政权也受到人民运动的沉重打击。“这些巨大的人民运动是一种新的事实。这些运动证明：在那些有北大西洋集团反动派所扶持的反动政权的国家里，不满情绪是普遍的”。
    陶里亚蒂最后指出，意大利政治危机是支持反动政策和冷战的大垄断资本的领导集团同民主的人民群众之间在全世界展开的斗争的一个方面。为了防止反动的阴谋，必须在经济和政治革新的纲领的基础上大力开展大规模的群众运动，使一切民主力量最广泛地合作。
    会议通过的最后决议号召全党竭尽全力发展工人阶级争取实现权利要求以及经济和政治要求的运动。
    决议指出：帝国主义势力的公开挑衅行动，表明了和平仍然面临着极其严重的威胁。同这种威胁进行斗争，是当前的迫切任务。
