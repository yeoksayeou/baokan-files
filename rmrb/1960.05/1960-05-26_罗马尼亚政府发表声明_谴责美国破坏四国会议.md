Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, May 25th: Newspapers here today published the Romanian government's statement regarding the US sabotage of the Four-Power Summit.

The statement said that the US government had sabotaged the holding of the highest-level meeting. Prior to the scheduled date of the meeting, US officials made remarks filled with the spirit of the Cold War and carried out the aggressive act of "U-2" type aircraft conducting provocative flights over the Soviet Union. The statements of the US President and other officials not only failed to condemn this act, which violated the most basic norms of international relations, failed to punish the criminals, and failed to guarantee that such actions would not be repeated in the future, but instead declared that violating the sovereignty of other countries was US national policy. The Romanian people and government fully support the Soviet government's solemn and resolute position, which is in line with the interests of defending and consolidating world peace.

The statement said that the activities of US aircraft conducting espionage flights over the Soviet Union have aroused the righteous anger of the Romanian people and other peace-loving people. They strongly condemn this action, which poses a particular danger to the cause of peace. The Romanian government believes that, in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter, the United Nations has a responsibility to take appropriate measures to end these aggressive actions by the United States.

    罗马尼亚政府发表声明
    谴责美国破坏四国会议
    新华社布加勒斯特25日电　这里的报纸今天刊登了罗马尼亚政府就美国破坏四国首脑会议发表的声明。
    声明说，美国政府破坏了最高级会议的举行。在预定的举行会议的日期以前，美国的官方人士就发表了充满冷战精神的言论，进行了“U—2”型飞机在苏联上空作挑衅飞行的侵略行动。美国总统和其他官方人士的声明不但没有谴责这种违反国际关系最起码的准则的行为，没有惩办罪犯，也没有保证将来不再重复这种行动，反而宣布侵犯别国主权是美国的国家政策。罗马尼亚人民和政府完全支持苏联政府符合保卫和巩固世界和平的利益的严正和坚决的立场。
    声明说，美国飞机在苏联上空进行间谍飞行的活动激起了罗马尼亚人民和其它爱好和平的人民的正当愤怒。他们严厉谴责这种对和平事业具有特别的危险性的行动。罗马尼亚政府认为，根据联合国宪章的原则，联合国有责任采取终止美国这种侵略行动的相应措施。
