Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, May 25th: In Yining City, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, our westernmost region bordering our great ally the Soviet Union, over 50,000 people held demonstrations and rallies on the 24th, resolutely supporting the Soviet Union's just stand against American imperialist aggression and angrily condemning the crimes of American imperialism in sabotaging the Four-Power Summit Conference.

Zhang Shigong, First Secretary of the CPC Yili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture Committee, Zhao Huaibi, Secretary of the Secretariat, Hasanov, Deputy Governor of the Autonomous Prefecture, Yusufov, Chief of Staff of the Yili Military Sub-district of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Bai Yunhai, First Secretary of the CPC Yining Municipal Committee, and other responsible persons from the Party, government, and army attended the meeting.

Sharunov, Consul of the Soviet Consulate in Yining, and consulate staff also attended the meeting.

Zhang Shigong spoke at the meeting first. He pointed out that the U.S. imperialism's dispatch of spy planes to invade Soviet airspace for military provocations and its brazen sabotage of the Four-Power Summit Conference were provocations against the entire socialist camp and against the 650 million Chinese people. The people of all ethnic groups in the Yili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, together with the autonomous region and the people of the whole country, resolutely support the Soviet government's solemn stand against the crimes of U.S. imperialism's provocations and firmly oppose U.S. imperialism's sabotage of the Four-Power Summit Conference. At present, U.S. imperialism is still stepping up its arms expansion and war preparations, intensifying international tensions, and plotting new wars of aggression. We must heighten our vigilance a hundredfold and resolutely fight to the end against U.S. imperialism's aggression and to defend world peace.

Sharunov, the Consul of the Soviet Consulate in Yining, also spoke at the meeting. He said: The bandit-like act of American military aircraft invading Soviet airspace has aroused the anger of the Soviet people, the Chinese people, and all peace-loving people of the world. This shameless act of aggression by U.S. imperialism is bound to be thoroughly defeated.

Yusufov, Chief of Staff of the Yili Military Sub-district, as well as the heads of the Autonomous Prefecture's Federation of Trade Unions, the Communist Youth League, the Women's Federation, and representatives of peasants and militiamen, also spoke at the meeting. They unanimously angrily condemned U.S. imperialism's aggression and provocations against the Soviet Union.

After the meeting, a demonstration was held.
