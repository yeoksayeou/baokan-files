It has only been five years since China started mountaineering. Thanks to your leadership and care under the Party and the state, and encouraged by the Party's General Line and the spirit of the Great Leap Forward, you have broken superstitions, liberated your minds, and continuously carried out arduous training and improved your climbing techniques. In the process of mountaineering, you have fully promoted the spirit of unity, mutual assistance, friendship, and collectivism, and therefore have been able to conquer this peak from the north in one fell swoop.

You have proved with your own actions that there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome in the face of the heroic Chinese people. Your victory fully demonstrates the wisdom and correctness of the Party's leadership, the superiority of the socialist system, and that the wisdom and strength of the collective are invincible. It also shows that China's mountaineering movement has achieved rapid development in just a few years under the leadership of the Party. After completely destroying the feudal serf system, the Tibetan people are working hard to develop production and mutual aid and cooperation movements under the leadership of the Party, and are gradually moving towards socialism. The solidarity, mutual assistance, heroic tenacity, determination to overcome difficulties, and collectivism shown in your mountaineering have greatly encouraged the people of Tibet. We hope that all comrades in the mountaineering team will further strengthen unity, work hard, persevere, and strive for more and greater honors for the motherland.
