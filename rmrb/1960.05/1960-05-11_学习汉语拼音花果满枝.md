Learning Chinese Pinyin Blossoms and Bears Fruit

    Everywhere, the Sound of Reading Can Be Heard

    From the Municipal Party Secretary to workers and peasants, the city of Houma is currently involved in a Pinyin learning movement.

    Zhang Yaoting, First Secretary of the Houma Municipal Party Committee, took the lead as an example, personally demonstrating and overseeing the effort. The Municipal People's Committee also issued notices and Pinyin learning schedules to all municipal organs, factories, mines, and schools, adopting various measures to make the advanced even more advanced, and the backward catch up with the advanced.

    Now, as soon as you enter Houma, you can see: slogans on the walls, plaques on the doors, meal tickets in the cafeterias, signs in the bookstores, all marked with Pinyin; the loudspeakers broadcast bpmf, and the projectors show aoei; cadres, workers, students' notebooks and commune members' work point record books are all annotated with Pinyin. In order to help everyone learn Pinyin well, Party committees at all levels have universally set up Pinyin stations in department stores, cinemas, village entrances, fields, canteens and other places to help the masses intensify their practice. A magnificent Pinyin learning upsurge is unfolding higher and higher in Houma.
  
    Vigorously Promote Teacher Training

    Dongfeng People's Commune in Xinding County, adopted the method of using points to lead the whole area, and combining points and the area, quickly set off a heat wave of the whole people learning Chinese Pinyin. In just two months, remarkable achievements have been made. According to the statistics of 4,307 farmer amateur red and expert school students, 2,267 have reached the level of recognizing, spelling, writing, using, and mastering syllables proficiently, and 1,562 can use the "four tones" to speak Mandarin.

    Their experiences are: ① Vigorously grasp teacher training. All 162 amateur teachers in the commune were given short-term intensive training for ten days and were able to teach proficiently. ② Extensive publicity, creating momentum, all signs, slogans, blackboards, propaganda boards, etc. in the commune were all annotated with Pinyin. ③ Unified arrangement, unified reporting, unified inspection; the learning organization is combined with the production organization, and the learning content is combined with the political and production center. ④ Strengthen teaching research to improve teaching quality. ⑤ Establish pacesetters in every profession, and each level has a key focus, and exchange experiences in a timely manner through on-site meetings, competitions, observations, and performances.

    Break Through the "Five Barriers" and Grasp the "Three Links"

    The Red and Expert School of Taiyuan Boiler Factory tightly grasped the "three links" and broke through the "five barriers," learning Chinese Pinyin, and achieved remarkable results.

    In February, according to the instructions from higher authorities, the factory Party committee put forward the call to "achieve Wanrong-ization by May 1st." Immediately, the whole factory set off a learning upsurge of "learning from Wanrong and catching up with Wanrong." The method they adopted was: break through the five barriers and grasp the three links. Breaking through the five barriers means: breaking through the pronunciation barrier, the letter arrangement barrier, the spelling barrier, the four tones barrier, and the rule barrier. Grasping the three links means: The first link is to grasp extensive reading. After the students master the Chinese Pinyin letters, they quickly let them read a large number of annotated textbooks and popular reading materials; the second link is to grasp extensive explanation. They combined similar lessons in the two volumes of Chinese language textbooks into four categories: poetry, stories, novels, and application writing, and then selected representative works from each category for key explanations; the third link is to grasp extensive writing. This is carried out simultaneously with the extensive explanation, mobilizing everyone to write, write every day, constantly consolidate and constantly improve.

    Because the method was correct, the workers' learning enthusiasm was very high, and the learning results were remarkable. As of April 5th, 85% of the workers had relatively proficiently mastered the Pinyin letters. The 316 students in the senior elementary class have been able to read a large number of annotated reading materials. Student Chen Rusheng, who initially read 630 characters in eight minutes, can now read 1,600 characters in eight minutes.

    The study of Chinese Pinyin has improved teaching quality, shortened teaching time, and promoted production development. In terms of teaching, the original plan was to spend 300 hours to complete the senior elementary Chinese language course, but after the promotion of Chinese Pinyin, it only took 100 hours to complete it. In terms of production, the degree of mechanization has also increased from 38.1% at the beginning of the year to 67.1%, and they won three consecutive victories, completing the first quarter production task in full 22 days ahead of schedule.

    A High Tide of Reading and Writing Sweeps Jinan Area

    Since this spring, the Chinese Pinyin learning movement in the Jinan area has swept the entire area. More than 1.46 million farmers, urban residents, workers, and cadres have participated in the study, and more than 700,000 have mastered the "Chinese Pinyin Scheme." With the mastery of Chinese Pinyin, a high tide of annotated reading and writing involving nearly one million people across the area is taking shape. The speed of the movement's development, the scope, the scale, and the magnitude of the achievements are unprecedented in the history of amateur education in the area.

    Recently, the CPC Jinan Prefectural Committee has made a decision: This year, Wanrong will achieve Qinggu-ization, and the entire area will achieve Qinggu-ization, and several Qinggu villages will emerge. The Prefectural Committee and the Commissioner's Office have also decided to conduct three major inspections and evaluations in the area before "October 1st."

    Learning Closely Integrated with Production

    More than 4,000 migrant workers at the Hengshan Reservoir construction site in Jiaocheng County, closely integrated with production, carried out the work of learning Chinese Pinyin and promoting Mandarin. From the construction site headquarters to the companies and battalions, Pinyin alphabet promotion and Mandarin promotion committees have been universally established, and full-time cadres have been transferred to carry out specific organization, leadership, and teaching work.

    The learning environment has been arranged everywhere on the construction site: all large and small slogans are annotated with Pinyin, literacy signs are established at intersections, and each migrant worker is required to practice speaking Mandarin while learning Chinese Pinyin.

    How do they teach? Teachers are trained by themselves, textbooks are compiled and printed by themselves, methods are explored by themselves, and learning time is based on the principle of close integration with production, with concentrated learning during less busy times, flexible learning during busy times, practice during breaks, and teaching during spare time. This fully guarantees teaching time.

    After just over a month of learning, the results of literacy among migrant workers have been effectively consolidated, thus setting off a high tide of reading and writing. Learning scenes are presented everywhere on the construction site.

    "Three Understandings" and "Three Accuracies"

    More than 1,000 faculty, staff, and students of Taiyuan Water Conservancy College have now all been involved in the heat wave of learning Chinese Pinyin. Everyone is full of confidence and high spirits, determined to master Chinese Pinyin and learn Mandarin in the shortest possible time.

    In order to strengthen leadership, under the leadership of the school Party committee, a "Chinese Pinyin Headquarters" was established, with the Party committee secretary serving as the commander-in-chief. Chinese language teachers and some teachers and students with a foundation in Mandarin formed a backbone group for learning and promoting Chinese Pinyin, and carried out special learning and training, adopting a method of combining learning and teaching, and self-study guidance, to carry out teaching activities. The school radio station conducts special broadcasts on Chinese Pinyin learning during breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day. All Chinese characters on bulletin boards and wall newspapers are also annotated with Pinyin, and Chinese Pinyin alphabet charts and slogans annotated with Chinese Pinyin are posted in classrooms, dormitories, and other corners. Everyone carries a small booklet of "Chinese Pinyin Alphabet Teaching Broadcast Lectures" with them, reading it in their spare time and practicing at any time. In order to learn quickly and well, each class has a supervision post, and everyone acts as a supervisor, conducting roadside tests anytime and anywhere, and no one is spared, from the principal to the family members of the workers. Units and individuals who are found to be not serious about learning or learning poorly are immediately sent gifts -- big-character posters and Chinese Pinyin alphabet charts.

    After two weeks of hard study and practice, all faculty, staff, and students have proficiently mastered the Pinyin alphabet and have achieved "three understandings" and "three accuracies." Three understandings: understand how to read, understand how to write, understand how to spell; three accuracies: accurate pronunciation, accurate spelling, and accurate four tones.

    On this basis, all faculty, staff, and students have mustered even greater efforts to continue to consolidate and improve the quality of Chinese Pinyin, and to advance toward Mandarin, to let "one branch blossom with two flowers."

    More Than a Thousand Qingshui Cadres Learn Pinyin

    More than 1,400 cadres in Qingshui County quickly achieved results in learning Chinese Pinyin and Mandarin. Before the start of the study, Li Dequan, the first secretary of the county party committee, gave a special mobilization report on "vigorously organizing the study of Chinese Pinyin and Mandarin," which greatly boosted the learning confidence of all cadres. All organs, factories, and mines then divided into ten classes according to their living conditions, with the heads of each department and bureau serving as class leaders, and organized learning groups by unit, electing group leaders and instructors; ten part-time teachers were also hired, using conference rooms and cultural remedial schools as school sites; and it was stipulated that learning would be conducted from 7:00 pm to 9:00 pm every day.

    Li Dequan, the first secretary of the county party committee, and Wang Jisheng, the secretary of the secretariat, took the lead in learning. All students adopted the method of package teaching and learning, mutual teaching and mutual learning after class, seizing the time for self-study. After seven days and nights of hard work, through testing, of the 1,240 cadres, 1,116 had learned the alphabet and spelling, and 993 had been able to speak Mandarin.

    学习汉语拼音花果满枝
    处处可闻读书声
    侯马市从市委书记到工农群众，目前都卷入了拼音学习运动。
    侯马市委第一书记张耀庭，以身作则，亲自出马带头示范，压阵督战。市人委亦向全市机关、厂矿、学校发出了学习拼音的通知和拼音学习排队表，采取各项措施，使先进者更先进，后进者赶上先进。
    现在，一走进侯马市，你就能看到：墙上的标语，门上的牌匾，食堂的饭票，书店的招牌，处处都标有拼音；广播筒里传播着bpmf，幻灯机上轮放着aoei；干部、职工、学生的笔记本和社员的记工手册上都注有拼音。各级党委为了使大家学好拼音，在门市部、电影院、村口、地头、食堂等场所，普遍设立了拼音台，帮助群众加紧练习。一个波澜壮阔的拼音学习高潮，正愈来愈高地在侯马市展开。
  大搞师资培训
    忻定县东风人民公社，采用以点带面，点面结合的办法，迅速掀起了全民学习汉语拼音的热潮。短短两个月中，已取得显著成绩。仅据四千三百零七名农民业余红专学校学员的统计，已有二千二百六十七人达到会认、会拼、会写、会用和熟练掌握音节，有一千五百六十二人能运用“四声”说普通话。
    他们取得的经验是：①大抓师资培训。全社一百六十二名业余教师，短期突击轮训了十天，就能熟练地代课了。②广泛宣传，大造声势，全社机关、学校招牌、标语、黑板报、鼓动牌等全部注音化。③统一安排，统一汇报，统一检查；学习组织与生产组织相结合，学习内容与政治、生产中心相结合。④加强教学研究，提高教学质量。⑤行行树标兵，层层有重点，通过现场会，评比、观摩、表演等形式，及时交流经验。
  破“五关”抓“三环”
    太原锅炉厂红专学校，紧抓“三环”、大破“五关”，学习汉语拼音，收到显著成绩。
    2月间，厂党委根据上级指示，提出“五一实现万荣化”的号召后，全厂立即掀起了“学万荣、赶万荣”学习高潮。他们采用的办法是：破五关、抓三环。破五关是：破发音关、字母搬家关、拼音关、四声关、规律关。抓三环是：第一环抓大阅读。在学员掌握了汉语拼音字母后，就很快让他们大量阅读注音课本和通俗读物；第二环抓大讲解，他们将两册语文的同类性的课，归并成诗歌、故事、小说、应用文四大类，再从各类中选出有代表性的作品，进行重点讲解；第三环抓大写作，这和大讲解同时进行，发动人人写、天天写，不断巩固、不断提高。
    由于方法对头，职工学习情绪很高，学习成绩显著。到4月5日止，已有85％的职工，较熟练地掌握了拼音字母。高小班的三百一十六名学员，已能大量阅读注音读物。学员陈如生，开始八分钟读六百三十个字，现在八分钟能读一千六百个字。
    汉语拼音的学习，提高了教学质量，缩短了教学时间，促进了生产发展。教学上原计划用三百个小时讲完高小语文，但在推广汉语拼音后，只用了一百个小时就讲完了。生产上，机械化程度亦由年初的38.1％上升到67.1％，并三战三捷，提前二十二天，全面完成了首季生产任务。
    读写高潮漫卷晋南区
    今春以来，晋南区汉语拼音学习运动漫卷全区，参加学习的农民、市民、职工、干部达一百四十六万多人，已有七十多万人掌握了“汉语拼音方案”。随着掌握汉语拼音，全区近百万人参加的注音读写高潮正在全区形成。运动发展之快，范围之广，规模之大，成绩之巨，在全区的业余教育史上是空前的。
    最近，中共晋南地委已做出决定：今年万荣实现青谷化，全区实现青谷化，并出现若干个青谷村。地委和专署还决定，在“十一”前，在全区内进行三次大检查、大评比。
  学习紧密结合生产
    交城县横山水库工地的四千多名民工，紧密结合生产，开展了学习汉语拼音和推广普通话的工作。从工地指挥部到连、营，普遍建立了推行拼音字母和推广普通话委员会，并抽调了专职干部，进行具体的组织领导和教学工作。
    工地到处布置了学习环境：大小标语全注音，路口建立识字牌，并要求每个民工在学习汉语拼音的同时，练习说普通话。
    他们是怎样教学的呢？教师由自己培训，教材由自己动手编印，方法自己摸索，学习时间，根据紧密结合生产的原则，小忙集中学，大忙机动学，休息时间练习，业余时间教学。这样就充分保证了教学时间。
    学习仅一个多月，已有效地巩固了民工的扫盲成果，从而掀起了读写高潮。工地上到处呈现出学习景象。
    “三会”“三准”
    太原水利专科学校的一千余名师生员工，目前已全部卷入了学习汉语拼音热潮。人人信心百倍，意气奋发，决心要在最短时间内，掌握汉语拼音，学好普通话。
    为了加强领导，在校党委的领导下，成立了“汉语拼音指挥部”，由党委书记担任总指挥。语文教师与一些普通话有基础的师生，组成学习与推广汉语拼音骨干小组，并进行了专门学习训练，采用边学边教，自学辅导相结合的办法，开展教学活动。学校广播室在每日早、午、晚饭时，都进行汉语拼音学习专题广播。板报、壁报上的汉字，也全部加上注音，教室、宿舍等各个角落，贴满了汉语拼音字母表和注有汉语拼音的标语。每人随身携带一本“汉语拼音字母教学广播讲座”小册子，抽空阅读，随时练习。为了学得快学得好，班班设有监督岗，人人都当监督员，随时随地进行拦路考试，上至校长，下至职工家属，都不放过，发现学习不认真或学得较差的单位与个人，立即送礼——大字报和汉语拼音字母表。
    经过两礼拜的苦学苦练，全校师生员工都已熟练掌握拼音字母，并做到了“三会”“三准确”。三会：会念、会写、会拼；三准确：发音准确，拼音准确，四声准确。
    在此基础上，全校师生员工鼓足更大干劲，要继续巩固提高汉语拼音质量，并向普通话进军，要让“一枝树开出两朵花”。
  沁水千余干部学会拼音
    沁水县一千四百余名机关干部，学习汉语拼音和普通话迅速取得成绩。学习开始前，县委第一书记李德全专门作了“关于大力组织学习汉语拼音和普通话”的动员报告，大大地鼓舞了全体干部的学习信心。各机关、厂矿随即按照居住情况划分了十个班，由各部、局长兼任班长，以单位编了学习小组，推选出小组长、辅导员；又聘请了十名兼职教师，利用会议室和文化补习学校作校址；规定每天下午七点至九点进行学习。
    县委第一书记李德全，书记处书记王冀升，首先带头学习。所有学员都在课后采取包教包学、互教互学的办法，抓紧时间进行自学。经过七昼夜的苦战，通过测验，一千二百四十名干部中，已有一千一百一十六人学会字母与拼音，九百九十三人已能说普通话。
