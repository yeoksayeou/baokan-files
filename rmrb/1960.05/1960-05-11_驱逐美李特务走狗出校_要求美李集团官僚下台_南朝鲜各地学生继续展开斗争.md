Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 10th—Seoul Dispatch: Students in various parts of South Korea are continuing their strike and demonstration struggles, demanding that American-Syngman Rhee special agents and puppet elements get out of the schools, and demanding the resignation of bureaucrats in the American-Syngman Rhee group's ruling institutions.

    According to South Korea's Hapdong News Agency, today, more than 4,000 students from Hanyang University in Seoul refused to attend classes from the first lesson, launching a strike. They demanded that the school's president, Kim Yeon-jun, and "puppet professor" get out of the school.
    According to Seoul Radio Station broadcasts, students from many universities in Seoul have launched struggles to drive out American-Syngman Rhee special agent "principals" and "puppet professors." When students at the College of Commerce of Seoul University failed to achieve their goal of removing "puppet professors" who trampled on freedom and democracy within the school, all students began a strike on the 7th. Students at the College of Music, the College of Science, and the College of Liberal Arts of Seoul University are also fighting to drive out American-Syngman Rhee special agents and puppet teachers.
    Students at Sungkyunkwan University in Seoul have warned the school's president, Lee Seon-geun, who once served as the "Minister of Education" in the Syngman Rhee puppet government, and Cho Dong-sik, the "Chairman of the School Foundation," telling them to get out of the school immediately, or the students will go on strike.
    In addition, students at Sookmyung Women's University, Hanyang Institute of Technology, and the College of Music in Seoul have also launched struggles demanding the resignation of the principals.
    According to Daegu Radio Station broadcasts, student representatives from Kyungpook University in Daegu City passed a resolution on the 9th stating that if their demands for the removal of American-Syngman Rhee special agent faculty and staff from the school are not met, the students will begin a strike on the 10th. On the morning of the 9th, students from the College of Medicine in Daegu City also walked out of the school to hold a strike to drive out "puppet professors" Lee Gyu-taek and Jung Chang-soo. The struggle of students in various parts of South Korea to drive out American-Syngman Rhee special agent elements from schools has now expanded from large cities to various localities. According to Donghwa News Agency, students at Jangheung Middle School in Jangheung County, Jeollanam-do, have also launched a struggle demanding the resignation of the school's special agent principal. At 11:00 a.m. on the 9th, they destroyed the principal's residence. A group of the principal's lackeys attempted to obstruct this struggle but were beaten away by the students. Later, this group of lackeys went into the police station, and the students destroyed the police station with stones. It is reported that in Wonju, Gangwon-do, 250 students held a demonstration on the 8th, demanding that the local branch prosecutor of the local procuratorate get out of the way immediately. The report said that this prosecutor had forced voters to vote for Syngman Rhee and Lee Ki-bung during the fake "presidential election" on March 15 this year.
    According to Toyo News Agency, the puppet "Minister of Education" of the new South Korean puppet government is embarrassed and at a loss under the attack of the increasingly high-spirited struggles of students in various places. He is trying to soften the students' fighting spirit with so-called "educational neutrality" and "school normalization." He also insulted the students' patriotic and just struggle, clamoring for "burying their heads in studying and tolerating everything." However, students in various parts of South Korea have completely seen through the deceptive tricks of American imperialism and its running dogs and have warned that if their demands are not met, they will hold strikes.
    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 10th—Seoul Dispatch: Today, in Seoul, which was heavily guarded by the Syngman Rhee puppet army and police, more than 300 unemployed people held a demonstration.
    It is reported that the demonstration began in Pagoda Park in Seoul. The demonstrators held up flags with slogans such as "Confiscate the property of the leaders of the Liberal Party" and demanded the punishment of corrupt officials of the Syngman Rhee group and the confiscation of bureaucratic property. Disregarding the strict guard of the Syngman Rhee puppet army and police, they marched on the streets of Seoul. Later, the South Korean puppet authorities dispatched troops equipped with carbines and bayonets to suppress the demonstration, and the demonstration dispersed.
    There are now about seven million unemployed people in South Korea. In the large-scale demonstrations of the South Korean people against the American-Syngman Rhee group, many unemployed people have bravely participated in demonstrations that destroyed and attacked the fascist ruling institutions of the American-Syngman Rhee group.

    驱逐美李特务走狗出校　要求美李集团官僚下台
    南朝鲜各地学生继续展开斗争
    新华社平壤10日电　汉城消息：南朝鲜各地的学生继续进行罢课和示威斗争，要求美李特务和御用分子从学校里滚出去，并且要求美李集团统治机构的官僚下台。
    据南朝鲜的合同通讯社报道，今天汉城市汉阳大学全校学生四千多人从第一堂课开始就拒绝上课，展开了罢课斗争。他们要求这个学校的校长金连俊和“御用教授”滚出学校去。
    据汉城广播电台广播，汉城许多大学的学生都展开了驱逐美李特务“校长”和“御用教授”的斗争。汉城大学的商科学院的学生在要求践踏学校内的自由和民主的“御用教授”出校没有达到目的时，全体学生从7日开始了罢课。汉城大学的音乐学院、理学院和文学院的学生们也在为驱逐美李特务和御用教员而斗争着。
    汉城成均馆大学的学生已经向这个学校校长、曾经作过李承晚傀儡政府“文教部长官”的李瑄根和“学校财团理事长”赵东植提出警告，叫他们立即滚出学校，不然学生们就要罢课。
    另外，汉城的淑明女子大学、汉阳工科大学和音乐大学的学生也都展开了要求校长下台的斗争。
    另据大丘广播电台广播，大丘市的庆北大学学生代表9日通过决议，如果他们提出的要求美李特务教职员出校的条件得不到实现的话，学生们将从10日开始罢课。大丘市的医科大学的学生在9日上午为了驱逐“御用教授”李奎泽、郑昌洙出校，也走出学校举行了罢课。南朝鲜各地学生驱逐美李特务分子出校的斗争现在已由大城市扩大到各个地方。据同和通讯社报道，全罗南道长兴郡长兴中学的学生们也展开了要求这个学校的特务校长下台的斗争，他们在9日上午十一时把这个校长的住宅捣毁了。有一批校长的狗腿子企图阻挠这一斗争，被学生们打跑了。后来这批狗腿子钻进了警察署，学生们用石块把这个警察署也捣毁了。据报道，江原道原州市在8日有二百五十名学生举行示威，要求当地的地方检察支厅的检事立即滚开。报道说，这个检事在今年3月15日进行伪“总统选举”时，曾经强迫选民投李承晚和李起鹏的票。
    据东洋通讯社报道，南朝鲜新傀儡政府的伪“文教部长官”在各地学生日益高涨的斗争打击下，已经狼狈不堪，正在设法用所谓“教育中立化”、“学校正常化”的甜言蜜语来软化学生们的斗争情绪。他还侮辱学生们的爱国正义斗争，叫嚷什么“埋头念书，容忍一切”。但是南朝鲜各地的学生们完全看穿了美帝国主义及其走狗的骗人把戏，并且提出警告说：如果他们的要求得不到满足，他们就举行罢课。
    新华社平壤10日电　汉城消息：今天，在李伪军警严密戒备中的汉城市，三百多名失业者举行了示威。
    据报道，示威是在汉城的宝塔公园开始的。示威的人们高举着写有“没收自由党领导人的财产”的口号的旗子，要求惩办李承晚集团的贪官污吏和没收官僚财产。他们不顾李伪军警岗哨森严，在汉城大街上前进。后来南朝鲜伪当局调派配备卡宾枪和刺刀的军队进行镇压，示威队伍才散开。
    现在南朝鲜约有七百万名失业者。在南朝鲜人民大规模的反对美李集团的示威斗争中，许多失业者曾经英勇地参加了捣毁和袭击美李集团法西斯统治机构的示威。
