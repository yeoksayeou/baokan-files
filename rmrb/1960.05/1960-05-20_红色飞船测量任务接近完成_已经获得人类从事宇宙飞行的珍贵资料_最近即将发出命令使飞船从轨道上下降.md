Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 19th: TASS reports that the Soviet satellite-type spaceship's scientific measurement program is proceeding smoothly according to the original plan and is nearing completion. Valuable data to determine the conditions for future human spaceflight has been obtained. The command to bring the satellite spaceship down from orbit will be issued from the ground soon.

By 20:00 Moscow time on the 18th (01:00 Beijing time on the 19th), the Soviet spaceship had orbited the Earth 59 times.

Telemetry information sent from the satellite spaceship indicates that the instruments and systems on the spaceship are working normally. The command radio circuit used to control the spaceship's equipment is functioning reliably. Telemetry receiving stations continue to constantly monitor the operation of the spaceship's equipment and its execution of commands sent from the ground. A large number of receiving stations are reliably receiving the radio signals from the spaceship's "Signal" transmitter. Chemical power sources and solar panels are ensuring a normal power supply to the spaceship's instruments.

    红色飞船测量任务接近完成
    已经获得人类从事宇宙飞行的珍贵资料
    最近即将发出命令使飞船从轨道上下降
    据新华社莫斯科19日讯　据塔斯社报道，苏联卫星式宇宙飞船的科学测量计划正在按照原来的规定顺利执行，并接近于完成。确定今后人在宇宙空间中飞行的条件的珍贵资料已经获得。使卫星式飞船从轨道上下降的命令，最近即将从地面发出。
    到莫斯科时间18日二十时（北京时间19日一时），苏联宇宙飞船围绕地球运行了五十九圈。
    卫星式飞船发来的遥测情报表明，装在飞船上的仪器和系统工作正常。用来控制飞船装备的指挥无线电路的功能是可靠的。遥测接收站继续对飞船装备的工作及其对于地面发去的命令的执行情况进行经常监视。大量的接收站正在有把握地接收飞船“信号”发射机的无线电讯号。化学电源和太阳能电池组保证着向飞船仪器正常供应电力。
