Xinhua News Agency, Casablanca, May 5th. Bai Ren, Ambassador of the People's Republic of China to Morocco, and Zhang Tingyu, Head of the Chinese Delegation to the Casablanca International Exposition, held a reception on the evening of the 4th to celebrate "China Pavilion Day" at the International Exposition. Among the approximately four hundred guests were Moroccan government officials, figures from the economic sector, diplomatic envoys, and other people from all walks of life.

The Chinese color folk dance film "Lotus Lantern" was shown at the reception and was warmly welcomed by the audience.

In the six days since the Casablanca International Exposition opened on April 28, more than 200,000 people have visited the China Pavilion. Visitors showed great interest in the rich and colorful exhibits in the China Pavilion, and even as late as 12:00 midnight, when the exposition was about to close, there were still visitors reluctant to leave the China Pavilion.

Some visitors wrote in the guestbook: "Here we have seen the achievements of the Great Leap Forward and the Chinese people," and "The achievements of China in the past ten years are astonishing and enough to prove the superiority of the socialist system." They wished "the Chinese people greater progress, because the progress of the Chinese people is for the peace of the world."

The booth in the Chinese Exhibition Hall selling Chinese goods and the cinema, which aroused great interest among the audience, were crowded with people every day.
