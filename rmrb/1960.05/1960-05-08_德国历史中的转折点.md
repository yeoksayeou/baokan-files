    A Turning Point in German History
    Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany
    Fifteen years ago, on May 8, 1945, a new era began in the history of the German people. Due to the anti-fascist Allied countries, with the glorious Soviet army as the main force, destroying the Hitler regime and eliminating the fascists, a turning point appeared in German history. The Soviet Union's victory over fascist German imperialism laid the cornerstone for the establishment of the peace-loving German Democratic Republic.
    The Soviet army not only liberated the German people from fascist rule but also made it possible for the German people to forever eliminate the imperialist forces that violated the interests of the people and the nation, and to embark on the road of democratic development in Germany. We, the German people, should deeply thank the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the heroic Soviet soldiers, and also deeply thank the countless heroes who carried out secret anti-fascist resistance struggles. The Soviet people suffered the greatest loss of life and material in the Great Patriotic War against German, Italian, and Japanese fascism. Especially in the struggle to destroy German fascism, the Soviet Union paid the greatest price. Since the people of the world's first socialist country brought freedom to the German people, the task before the German working class and the German anti-fascist democratic forces was: to establish their own system on German soil, on their own initiative.
    The Soviet people and the Soviet army always distinguished between the fascist reactionaries and the German people. After defeating Hitler's fascism, the Soviet people and the Soviet army immediately helped the German people to establish a new democratic life. In the Soviet-occupied zone, residents gained democratic freedoms, enabling them to completely eliminate fascism with their own strength, and to purge the remnants of fascist ideology and reactionary habits in the struggle to build a new democratic system. The merger of the German Communist Party and the German Social Democratic Party, the unity of the German working class, the establishment of the unified Free German Trade Union Federation and the Free German Youth League, and the alliance between the working class and the peasants, ensured that the working people could take their destiny into their own hands.
    Today, fifteen years after the defeat of Hitler's fascism, in a large part of Germany, in the German Democratic Republic, the ideas of peace, democracy, and socialism have triumphed. The German Democratic Republic has become a bulwark of peace and progress for the whole of Germany. As a united, peace-loving, democratic, and progressive country, the German Democratic Republic is fighting for peace and the national rebirth of Germany. The "People's Plan on the German Question" issued by our Party Central Committee points out the way to save our nation and prosper our nation. Workers, peasants, intellectuals, artisans, and industrialists and businessmen look back with pride on the achievements made under the leadership of the revolutionary party of the working class over the past fifteen years. It proves that after eradicating fascism and imperialism, after purging all kinds of racial hatred, and after purging the policy of aggression, the working people have established a socialist social system along the democratic path. At present, the world is in a stage of transition from capitalism to socialism, and we are completing the most humane task before our German people.
    The example of the German Democratic Republic makes it easier for the working class and peace-loving forces in West Germany to understand, fifteen years after the defeat of fascism, that the elimination of imperialism, the elimination of racial hatred, the cessation of territorial demands, and the elimination of militarism are tasks that are inextricably linked to the survival of our nation. The German Democratic Republic, the first worker-peasant state in Germany, provides an example to the entire German people that Germany can have a life of peace, freedom, and prosperity only by eliminating militarism, only by the whole of Germany abandoning revanchist aims and territorial demands, and only by persistently following democratic principles.
    Because the basic issues of the nation have been resolved in the German Democratic Republic, we have laid the foundation for peace, democracy, progress, and friendship among peoples for the whole of Germany. According to the laws of social development, after the German bourgeoisie twice led our motherland to the disaster of war, and when they attempted to embark on the road of war for the third time, the new and progressive class—the working class—took over the leadership. The German bourgeoisie has proven itself unable to lead our nation. Rebuilding a united, peace-loving, democratic Germany is the historical task of the working class and all peace-loving and democratic national forces. After the Hitler fascism that led Germany to disaster was isolated, West Germany is now being isolated again due to Adenauer's policy of re-militarization and atomic armament. Therefore, the self-liberation of the German people in the west of our country, under the rule of militarists, is a decisive contribution to the national rebirth of Germany and is in the fundamental interests of the broad masses of the German people.
    Based on an accurate assessment of the international situation and the development of the two Germanys, the Socialist Unity Party of Germany has formulated a constructive plan for the peaceful resolution of the German question in the "People's Plan on the German Question". May this plan help the working people of West Germany more consciously promote the forward development of society. In this "People's Plan on the German Question", there is a passage that elaborates on "great national reconciliation," which mentions the role of the German Democratic Republic:
    "...Within the scope of peaceful cooperation between the two Germanys, the two social systems compete with each other, and prove with facts which system can make the most contributions to the German people."
    It continues to mention:
    "We assure you that everything we do is for the benefit of the entire German people, that is, for the reunification of the German people. We are developing socialism in the German Democratic Republic in order to prove that when we abandon the policy of revanchism and militarism, when the great creative power of the German working class and all strata contribute to the peace and prosperity of the motherland, all of our German people will obtain a peaceful, prosperous, and happy life, and all of our German people will also achieve a respected position in the lives of all nations. The victory of socialism in the German Democratic Republic will also make it easier to achieve the great national reconciliation that we are striving for."
    The working people of the German Democratic Republic have become conscious historical creators in all aspects of social life. A new type of relationship of mutual assistance, cooperation, and respect has been fully formed among them. Cultivating highly cultured and well-rounded people, moving from "I" to "we", and organizing "socialist labor teams" in cities and villages—this is the most meaningful thing in our socialist democratic life.
    After completing the Seven-Year Plan, the consolidated alliance of the German working class and agricultural production cooperative peasants, intellectuals, and other laborers will prove the superiority of the socialist social system in all aspects. This will further strengthen the position of peace and socialism throughout Germany, thereby enabling the entire people to make the most important contribution in the great struggle to eliminate German imperialism, to reunify our motherland into a peace-loving, democratic, and progressive Germany, and to a Germany that lives in the friendship of all nations.

    德国历史中的转折点
    德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记  乌布利希
    十五年前，1945年5月8日，在德国人民的历史上开始一个新的时代，由于以光荣的苏联军队为主要力量组成的反法西斯同盟国家，摧毁了希特勒政权，消灭了法西斯分子，在德国历史上出现了一个转折点。苏联战胜法西斯德国帝国主义，为建立爱好和平的德意志民主共和国奠定了基石。
    苏联军队不仅把德国人民从法西斯统治下解放出来，同时也使德国人民有可能永远消除违反人民利益、违反民族利益的帝国主义势力，使德国走上民主发展的道路。我们德国人民应该深切地感谢苏联共产党和英勇的苏军战士，也深切地感谢秘密进行反法西斯抵抗斗争的无数英雄们。苏联人民在反对德国、意大利和日本法西斯主义的伟大卫国战争中，遭受了最大的生命牺牲和物质损失。尤其在摧毁德国法西斯主义的斗争中，苏联付出的代价是最大的。自从世界上第一个社会主义国家的人民给德国人民带来了自由以后，摆在德国工人阶级和德国的反法西斯民主力量面前的任务是：由自己做主，在德国的土地上建立自己的制度。
    苏联人民和苏联军队始终分清法西斯反动派和德国人民之间的区别，在击溃希特勒法西斯之后，苏联人民和苏联军队立即帮助德国人民，建立新的民主的生活。在前苏军占领区里，居民获得了民主自由，从而使他们能够用自己的力量，彻底消灭法西斯主义，使他们能够在为建设一个新的民主的制度的斗争中，肃清法西斯思想的残余和反动的习性。德国共产党和德国社会民主党的合并，德国工人阶级的团结，统一的自由德国工会联合会和自由德国青年联盟的建立以及工人阶级和农民的联盟，保证了劳动人民能够将命运掌握在自己的手中。
    在击溃希特勒法西斯主义的十五年后的今天，在德国的一大部分，在德意志民主共和国，和平、民主和社会主义的思想取得了胜利。德意志民主共和国已经成为整个德国和平和进步的堡垒。德意志民主共和国作为一个团结一致、爱好和平、民主和进步的国家，正在为争取和平和德国民族新生而斗争。我们党中央委员会发表的“人民关于德国问题的计划”，指出了拯救我们民族、繁荣我们民族的道路，工人、农民、脑力劳动者、手工业工人和工商业者们，都以自豪的心情，回顾十五年来在工人阶级革命政党的领导下所取得的成就。它证明了在铲除法西斯主义和帝国主义以后，在肃清形形色色的种族仇视现象以后，在肃清侵略政策以后，劳动人民沿着民主的途径，建立了社会主义的社会制度。目前世界正处在从资本主义向社会主义过渡的阶段，我们正完成摆在我们德国人民面前最人道的任务。
    德意志民主共和国的例子使西德的工人阶级和爱好和平力量，在击溃法西斯主义的十五年后，更易于理解到消灭帝国主义、消除种族的仇恨、制止领土要求、消灭军国主义是与我们民族生存休戚相关的任务。德意志民主共和国，德国第一个工人和农民的国家，给全德国人民提出了一个例证，只有消灭了军国主义，只有整个德国放弃复仇主义的目的和领土的要求，只有坚持不懈地遵循着民主的原则，德国才能有和平、自由和繁荣富强的生活。
    由于民族的基本问题在德意志民主共和国获得了解决，因而我们为整个德国奠定了和平、民主、进步和人民之间友好的基础。根据社会发展的规律，在德国资产阶级两次将我们的祖国引向战争的灾难之中以后，在他们企图第三次踏上战争的道路的时候，新的进步的阶级——工人阶级掌握了领导权。德国的资产阶级已经自己证明了他们不能领导我们的民族。重建一个团结一致、爱好和平、民主的德国，这是工人阶级和一切爱好和平和民主的民族力量的历史任务。把德国导向灾难的希特勒法西斯主义受到孤立以后，如今西德又由于阿登纳奉行重新军国主义化和原子军备的政策而再度被孤立了。因此，使德国人民在我们祖国的西方，在军国主义分子统治下自我解放出来，对德国民族新生是一个具有决定意义的贡献，是德国广大人民的根本利益。
    在对国际形势和两个德国的发展作了精确的估价的基础上，德国统一社会党在“人民关于德国问题的计划”中，为和平解决德国问题制订了一项建设性的计划。但愿这个计划有助于西德的劳动人民更自觉地促进社会的向前发展。在这份“人民关于德国问题的计划”中，有一段阐述了“伟大的民族谅解”，它提到了德意志民主共和国的作用：
    “……在两个德国的和平合作的范围内，两个社会制度互相竞赛，并且用事实来证明，哪一种制度能为德国人民作出最多的贡献。”
    下面继续提到：
    “我们向你们保证，我们所作的一切是为了全体德国人民的利益，也就是为了德国人民的重新统一。我们在德意志民主共和国发展社会主义，是为了证实当我们摒弃了复仇主义政策和军国主义，当德国工人阶级和各个阶层的巨大创造力量为祖国的和平和富强作出贡献的时候，我们全体德国人民就会获得一个和平、富强和幸福的生活，我们全体德国人民，也会在各国人民生活中取得一个受尊敬的地位。社会主义在德意志民主共和国的胜利，也将会促使我们所争取的伟大的民族谅解更加易于实现。”
    德意志民主共和国的劳动人民，在社会生活的各个方面已经成为自觉的历史缔造者。在他们之间完全形成了相互帮助，相互合作和相互尊重的新型关系。培养具有高度文化教养和全面发展的人，从“我”走向“我们”，以及在城市和农村中组织“社会主义劳动队”——这是我们社会主义民主生活中最具有意义的事情。
    完成七年计划以后，德国工人阶级和农业生产合作社农民、知识分子以及和其他劳动者的巩固的联盟，将证明社会主义社会制度在各个方面的优越性。这将更进一步加强和平和社会主义在整个德国的地位，从而使全国人民在为消灭德国帝国主义，为我们祖国重新统一成为一个爱好和平、民主和进步的德国，成为一个在各国人民友谊之中生活的德国的伟大斗争中，作出最重要的贡献。
