Xinhua News Agency, May 3rd: A grand rally of youth and people from all walks of life in the capital to support the patriotic and just struggle of the Turkish people will be held on the afternoon of May 4th. The Central People's Broadcasting Station will broadcast the proceedings live on its first program channel at 2:50 PM on May 4th. Beijing Television will also broadcast the event simultaneously.

Xinhua News Agency, May 1st: The All-China Students' Federation today sent a telegram to the International Student Union to forward to Turkish students, expressing the resolute support of all Chinese students for their heroic struggle against the Mandres dictatorial government, which is supported by U.S. imperialism, and expressing boundless anger and severe condemnation for the Turkish reactionary government's dispatch of military police to suppress students in a barbaric manner.

The telegram said that the Mandres government, acting on the orders of its U.S. imperialist masters, implemented a fascist dictatorial rule, plunging the Turkish people into an abyss of suffering, which the Turkish people and young students absolutely cannot tolerate. Countless facts have proven that any reactionary rule supported by U.S. imperialism will inevitably be strongly opposed by the people and completely overthrown. The massive struggle currently launched by the South Korean people has already forced the puppet Lee Seung-man, fostered by U.S. imperialism, to step down. The anti-American anger of the South Korean people is burning ever more fiercely. We firmly believe that in today's world, where the forces of peace and anti-imperialism of the people of the world have greatly surpassed the aggressive forces of imperialism, as long as we strengthen unity and persist in the struggle against imperialism and dictatorial rule, victory will surely belong to the Turkish people, youth, and students.

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, May 3rd: The World Federation of Democratic Youth, on May 2nd, in the name of its 87 million members, sent a telegram to Turkish Prime Minister Mandres, strongly protesting the Turkish government's heinous acts of barbarically suppressing students and youth in Istanbul and Ankara.

The telegram expressed support for the legitimate demands of Turkish youth for democracy and freedom. The telegram demanded that the Turkish government abolish martial law, release those arrested, and respect human rights.

On the same day, the World Federation of Democratic Youth sent telegrams to the student organizations of Istanbul University, Ankara University, and other universities in Turkey, expressing support for their struggle for democracy and freedom.

Xinhua News Agency, May 3rd: Istanbul dispatch: Students in Istanbul, Turkey's largest city, continued to hold demonstrations today against the fascist rule of the Mandres government. Hundreds of students participated in the demonstration, chanting slogans such as "Freedom."

After five consecutive days of large-scale anti-government demonstrations, the situation in Istanbul remains very tense today. The Mandres reactionary government is intensifying its efforts to suppress the people's just struggle with various brutal means.

Heavily armed forces were stationed around the Istanbul City Hall today. Six heavy tanks guarded the nearby streets. The foreign ministers of the member states of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc, who are meeting in Istanbul, had to be escorted by motorcycle convoys through layers of cordons on the streets to enter the city hall. The Mandres government also dispatched air force planes to intimidate the people over the city. On the ground, troops used to suppress the people patrolled the streets with small wireless telephones.

While carrying out military suppression, the Mandres government's "Emergency Command" also issued a communique requiring all citizens to carry identification cards and documents stating their places of work. It also banned all religious gatherings. At the same time, it further intensified the blockade of news. It is reported that seven daily and weekly newspapers have been ordered to close or suspend publication in the past few days.

The current anti-government demonstration in Turkey reflects the outbreak of pent-up resentment among the people against the long-term reactionary rule of the Mandres government. This demonstration began on April 21st with Ankara students protesting the Mandres government's forceful passage in parliament of a bill prohibiting all political activities. In recent days, it has rapidly developed into large-scale demonstrations involving thousands and tens of thousands of people. Flames of anger are burning in major Turkish cities such as Ankara, Istanbul, and Izmir. Demonstrators unanimously shouted slogans such as "Demand the resignation of the Mandres government" and "We want freedom." The participants in the demonstrations included students, youth, teachers, and legal workers.

The Mandres government has carried out frenzied massacres and arrests of demonstrators. Among the approximately one hundred legal workers who demonstrated on May 2nd, at least thirty were arrested.

Despite this, Western news agencies reported today that "there appears to be no indication that Turkey's domestic problems can be resolved soon."

    支持土耳其人民爱国正义斗争
    首都青年和各界人民今日举行盛大集会
    我全国学联、世界民主青联致电土耳其学生表示支持
    土耳其主要城市反独裁政府的斗争继续发展
    新华社3日讯　首都青年和各界人民支持土耳其人民爱国正义斗争大会将在5月4日下午举行，中央人民广播电台将在5月4日下午两点五十分，用第一套节目的频率，转播这次大会的实况，北京电视台也将同时转播。
    新华社1日讯　中华全国学生联合会今天致电国际学生联合会转土耳其学生，代表全中国学生坚决支持他们反对美帝国主义支持下的曼德列斯独裁政府的英勇斗争，并对土耳其反动政府出动军警镇压学生的野蛮暴行表示无比的愤怒和严厉的谴责。
    电报说，曼德列斯政府秉承美帝国主义主子的意旨，实行法西斯独裁统治，把土耳其人民投入痛苦的深渊，这是土耳其人民和青年学生所绝不能容忍的。无数事实说明，凡是美帝国主义所支持的反动统治，必将遭到人民强烈的反对和被完全打倒。目前南朝鲜人民所掀起的声势浩大的斗争，已经迫使美帝国主义所一手扶植的傀儡李承晚下台。南朝鲜人民反美怒火正愈烧愈旺。我们深信，在全世界人民的和平、反帝力量已经大大超过帝国主义侵略势力的今天，只要加强团结，坚持反对帝国主义、反对独裁统治的斗争，胜利一定属于土耳其人民和青年、学生。
    新华社布达佩斯3日电　世界民主青年联盟2日以它的八千七百万会员的名义致电土耳其总理曼德列斯，强烈抗议土耳其政府对伊斯坦布尔和安卡拉的学生和青年进行野蛮镇压的罪恶行为。
    电文对土耳其青年争取民主和自由的合法要求表示支持。电文要求土耳其政府废除戒严令、释放被逮捕的人和尊重人权。
    同一天，世界民主青年联盟致电伊斯坦布尔大学、安卡拉大学以及土耳其其他大学的学生组织，对它们争取民主和自由的斗争表示支持。
    新华社3日讯　伊斯坦布尔消息：土耳其最大城市伊斯坦布尔的学生今天继续举行了反对曼德列斯政府法西斯统治的示威。参加示威的有数百名学生，他们高呼“自由”等口号。
    在连续五天大规模的反政府示威之后，伊斯坦布尔今天的局势仍然十分紧张。曼德列斯反动政府正变本加厉地采取各种残暴手段加紧镇压人民的正义斗争。
    伊斯坦布尔市政厅周围今天派有重兵把守。六辆重型坦克守住附近的街道。正在伊斯坦布尔开会的北大西洋侵略集团成员国的外交部长们不得不分别由摩托车队护送着穿过街上层层的警戒线而进入市政厅的会场。曼德列斯政府还出动了空军的飞机在市区上空威吓人民。在地面上，用来镇压人民的军队带着小型无线电话机在街上巡逻。
    在军事镇压的同时，曼德列斯政府的“紧急状态司令部”还发表了一项公报，要所有市民必须携带身份证和注明他们工作地点的证明文件。它还禁止一切宗教集会。同时它进一步加紧封锁消息。据报道，过去几天之内，有七家日报和周报被勒令封闭或停刊。
    土耳其的这一次反政府大示威，反映了人民群众对曼德列斯政府长期反动统治所蕴积的愤恨情绪的爆发。这次示威以4月21日安卡拉学生抗议曼德列斯政府在议会强行通过禁止一切政治活动的议案为起点，近几天来迅速发展成为几千人和上万人的大示威，愤怒的火焰在安卡拉、伊斯坦布尔和伊兹密尔等土耳其的主要城市燃烧着。示威者一致喊出“要求曼德列斯政府辞职”，“要自由”的口号。参加示威的群众包括学生、青年、教员以及法律工作者。
    曼德列斯政府对示威进行疯狂地屠杀和逮捕。仅在5月2日举行示威的约一百名法律工作者中间就有至少三十人被捕。
    尽管如此，西方通讯社今天报道，看来目前仍然“没有任何迹象表明土耳其的国内问题可以早日解决”。
