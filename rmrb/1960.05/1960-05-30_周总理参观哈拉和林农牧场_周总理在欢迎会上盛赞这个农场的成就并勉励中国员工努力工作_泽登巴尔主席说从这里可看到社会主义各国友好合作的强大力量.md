Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, May 29th: Premier Zhou Enlai, accompanied by Chairman Tsedenbal, visited the Khara Khorin State Farm, the Khujirt Sanatorium, and the Livestock Machinery Station in the western grasslands of the People's Republic of Mongolia's Khangai Province today. He was warmly welcomed by local party and government leaders, as well as the vast number of workers and herdsmen.

Everywhere the Chinese guests went on the vast grasslands, there were huge portraits of Comrades Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Tsedenbal, and Sambuu. The national flags of China and Mongolia and colorful banners fluttered everywhere, with slogans like "Long live the unbreakable friendship between the people of Mongolia and China" displayed one after another. When Premier Zhou Enlai arrived at the farm, sanatorium, and livestock machinery station, crowds lined the streets to welcome him at each location. Z. Zhaodor, First Secretary of the Khangai Provincial Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, Vice Governor Oidoob, and other leaders joined the cheering crowds in warmly welcoming Premier Zhou. Many herdsmen traveled on horseback from the grasslands tens of miles away to offer their welcome.

The Khara Khorin State Farm held a grand rally to welcome Premier Zhou. More than two thousand people, including all the farm's employees, herdsmen and their families, Chinese employees working here, and Soviet and Hungarian experts, repeatedly cheered and paid tribute to Premier Zhou at the meeting.

Premier Zhou Enlai spoke amidst warm applause and cheers. He said that he would convey the friendship of the people of Khangai Province and the agricultural workers and herdsmen of the Khara Khorin State Farm to the Chinese people, and at the same time, convey the respect of the 650 million Chinese people to the Mongolian people attending the welcoming rally.

Premier Zhou said that the People's Republic of Mongolia has vast land and abundant underground resources, and now the hardworking and simple Mongolian people are engaged in socialist construction. To build, it is necessary to increase the population, develop resources, and settle herdsmen; it is necessary to develop agriculture, build water conservancy projects, develop industry, and expand the ranks of workers. Today, from our visit to the Khara Khorin State Farm, we have seen the thriving scene of the Mongolian people, under the leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, developing agriculture and industry mainly through self-reliance. This farm is a very good example. Premier Zhou warmly congratulated the farm on its achievements in developing agriculture, animal husbandry and industry.

Premier Zhou encouraged the Chinese employees working here to work hard, faster and better to build the Khara Khorin water conservancy and irrigation project well.

Premier Zhou once again thanked the hosts for their grand welcome. He said that today's grand welcoming meeting is a combination of Sino-Mongolian friendship, and the Khara Khorin State Farm is a combination of the labor of the Chinese and Mongolian people. He finally shouted "Long live Sino-Mongolian friendship and friendly mutual assistance and cooperation."

Chairman Tsedenbal then spoke at the welcoming rally. He said that we are very pleased to be able to welcome our closest friend, Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, in this ancient historical region.

He said that the working people of the People's Republic of Mongolia, with the help of the great allies of the Soviet Union and China, have developed the old site of this ancient city of "Khara Khorin" into a major agricultural production town. In 1959, the Khara Khorin State Farm planted more than 13,000 hectares of land and harvested an average of 13 quintals of grain from each hectare of non-irrigated land. From this, we can clearly see the great strength of mutual assistance and friendly cooperation between the people of socialist countries.

Chairman Tsedenbal said that in the Khara Khorin State Farm, more than 2,000 Chinese workers and technicians are building water conservancy and irrigation projects. After the completion of this project, it will create conditions for greater harvests. Chinese experts are also building a hydropower station with a capacity of more than 500 kilowatts for us. In addition, comrades from the Soviet Union and Hungary are helping with the construction. He expressed his heartfelt thanks to the Chinese, Soviet, and Hungarian comrades working here.

Chairman Tsedenbal wished all the employees of the farm greater success in their work, wished the Chinese people new achievements in the cause of building socialism and defending world peace, and wished the friendship between Mongolia and China continuous development and consolidation.

The speeches of Premier Zhou Enlai and Chairman Tsedenbal constantly aroused warm cheers and applause.

Z. Zhaodor, First Secretary of the Khangai Provincial Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, delivered a speech at the beginning of the welcoming rally. He warmly welcomed Premier Zhou Enlai to visit here on behalf of the party and government leading organs of the province and the people of the province. Darza, the leader of Mongolia's first agricultural "Socialist Labor Team," and Yuan Zijun, the representative of the Chinese employees working here, both gave excited speeches. Darza said that today is the happiest day for the farm, and everyone feels very honored by Premier Zhou's visit. He particularly talked about the deep friendship they have established with the Chinese employees. He said that China's help to this farm is a manifestation of the sincere friendship of the Chinese people to the Mongolian people. He said that all the agricultural workers will work harder in the future and use better results to thank Premier Zhou for his visit.

In his speech, Yuan Zijun reported to Premier Zhou Enlai and Chairman Tsedenbal on the construction of the Khara Khorin water conservancy project. On behalf of all Chinese employees, he proposed that they will never be arrogant or impatient, continue to forge ahead bravely, and guarantee the early and successful completion of this water conservancy project. Before the welcoming rally, Farm Director Purbu introduced the farm's situation to Premier Zhou. The Khara Khorin State Farm is an agricultural farm with more than 30,000 hectares of arable land, of which 15,000 hectares have been planted this year. Premier Zhou Enlai went by car to visit the water conservancy irrigation canals being built on the farm. Li Weizhi, a Chinese engineer helping with the construction here, reported the construction situation to Premier Zhou and Chairman Tsedenbal. This water conservancy project started in June last year and has now completed 70% of the entire project. Upon completion, it can irrigate 8,000 hectares of land.

Premier Zhou came to the head of the canal and visited the sluice gate and dam. He spoke with the Chinese technicians with concern about various issues such as river flow and dam depth. Premier Zhou also visited the construction base of the hydroelectric power station.

Premier Zhou visited Erdeni Zuu, an ancient temple built hundreds of years ago in the Khara Khorin grassland. Premier Zhou also wrote an inscription in the guestbook:

"This ancient castle and temple is the best historical textbook. That is to say, it can educate our descendants from the opposite side, so that they know how the rulers of the old era used religious superstition to enslave and oppress the working people of the time to serve these reactionary rulers. However, the reactionary rulers have long ceased to exist, while the labor achievements and artistic achievements of the working people will last forever."

Subsequently, Premier Zhou Enlai, Chairman Tsedenbal, and others traveled from the farm to Khujirt by plane to visit the sanatorium. More than two thousand herdsmen, patients, and others living here gathered at the airport to cheer for Premier Zhou.

Z. Zhaodor, First Secretary of the Party Committee of Khangai Province, hosted a luncheon at the sanatorium to entertain Premier Zhou and his entourage. Chairman Tsedenbal and others also attended the luncheon.

Premier Zhou visited various facilities of the sanatorium, such as the bathhouse and medical room. This is a mineral spring sanatorium, and there are now more than two hundred employees from all over the country recuperating here.

Premier Zhou also watched the song and dance performances of the sanatorium employees and patients. Premier Zhou Enlai also visited a nearby livestock machinery station to see tractors and other agricultural machinery. Premier Zhou talked with the person in charge of the machinery station, hoping that the machinery station would make full use of the machinery, keep the machinery running, and increase production even more.

At a little past six o'clock, Premier Zhou Enlai bid farewell to the people of Khujirt. People lined up to see him off at the sanatorium and airport, cheering for Premier Zhou again and again, wishing Premier Zhou a safe journey. Premier Zhou, Chairman Tsedenbal, and others returned to Ulaanbaatar at 7:30 in the afternoon.

Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, May 29th: Premier Zhou Enlai, accompanied by Chairman Tsedenbal, left Ulaanbaatar by special plane this morning to visit the Khara Khorin Farm in Khangai Province.

    新华社乌兰巴托29日电　周恩来总理由泽登巴尔主席陪同，今天到蒙古人民共和国西部草原参观访问了前杭爱省的哈拉和林国营农牧场、胡吉尔特疗养院和畜牧业机器站，受到了当地党政负责人和广大职工、牧民的热烈欢迎。
    在浩翰的草原上，中国贵宾所到的地方，到处可以看到毛泽东、刘少奇、周恩来、泽登巴尔、桑布等同志的巨幅画像。中蒙两国的国旗和彩旗四处飘扬，“蒙中两国人民牢不可破的友谊万岁”的大标语一幅接着一幅。周恩来总理到达农牧场、疗养院和畜牧业机器站的时候，每一个地方都有夹道欢迎的群众。蒙古人民革命党前杭爱省委员会第一书记佐奥多尔、副省长奥伊多布和其他负责人同夹道欢呼的群众一起，热烈欢迎周总理。很多牧民从几十里路以外的草原上骑马赶来欢迎。
    哈拉和林国营农牧场举行了盛大的集会欢迎周总理，全场职工、牧民和他们的家属，在这里工作的中国员工、苏联和匈牙利的专家们共两千多人，在大会上不断地向周总理欢呼致敬。
    周恩来总理在热烈的掌声和欢呼声中讲话。他表示要把前杭爱省人民、哈拉和林国营农牧场农业工人和牧民们的友谊转达给中国人民，同时，也把六亿五千万中国人民对蒙古人民的敬意转达给参加欢迎大会的蒙古主人。
    周总理说，蒙古人民共和国有广大的土地和丰富的地下资源，现在勤劳纯朴的蒙古人民正在进行社会主义建设。要建设，就需要增加人口，开发资源，把牧民定居下来；就需要发展农业，兴修水利，发展工业，壮大工人队伍。今天，我们从参观哈拉和林国营农牧场中，看到了蒙古人民在蒙古人民革命党领导下以自力更生为主地发展农牧业和工业的欣欣向荣的情景。这个农牧场是一个很好的典型。周总理热烈地祝贺这个农牧场发展农牧业和工业的成就。
    周总理勉励在这里工作的中国员工，要好好地努力工作，更快更好地把哈拉和林水利灌溉工程修建好。
    周总理再一次感谢主人们的盛大欢迎。他说，今天这个盛大的欢迎会就是中蒙友谊的结合，哈拉和林国营农牧场就是中蒙人民劳动的结合。他最后欢呼中蒙友谊和友好互助合作万岁。
    泽登巴尔主席接着在欢迎大会上讲了话。他说，我们非常高兴能在这个古老的历史地区欢迎我们最亲密的朋友、中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来同志。
    他说，蒙古人民共和国的劳动人民在伟大盟邦苏联和中国的帮助下，已经把这个古城“哈拉和林”的旧址，发展成为一个农业生产的主要市镇了。在1959年，哈拉和林国营农牧场播种了一万三千多公顷土地，并且从没有灌溉的每一公顷土地上平均收获了十三公担粮食。从这里可以明显地看到社会主义各国人民的互相帮助和友好合作的强大力量。
    泽登巴尔主席说，在哈拉和林国营农牧场中，有两千多名中国工人和技术人员正在建筑水利灌溉工程，这个工程完工以后，就为更大的丰收创造了条件。中国能手们还在为我们建立有五百多瓩发电能力的水电站。另外还有苏联和匈牙利的同志在帮助建设。他向在这里工作的中国、苏联和匈牙利的同志表示衷心的谢意。
    泽登巴尔主席祝农牧场的全体职工在工作中获得更大的成就，祝中国人民在建设社会主义和保卫世界和平的事业中取得新的成就，祝蒙中友谊不断发展和巩固。
    周恩来总理和泽登巴尔主席的讲话，不断地引起热烈的欢呼声和掌声。
    蒙古人民革命党前杭爱省委员会第一书记佐奥多尔在欢迎大会开始的时候致词。他代表全省党政领导机关和全省人民热烈欢迎周恩来总理到这里进行参观访问。蒙古第一个农牧业“社会主义劳动队”队长达尔扎和在这里工作的中国员工代表袁子钧都兴奋激动地讲了话。达尔扎说，今天是农牧场最高兴的一天，周总理的来访使大家感到非常光荣。他特别谈到他们同中国员工相处所建立的深厚友情。他说，中国对这个农牧场的帮助是中国人民对蒙古人民真诚友谊的表现。他表示，全场农业工人今后将加倍努力生产，以更好的成绩来答谢周总理的访问。
    袁子钧在讲话中向周恩来总理和泽登巴尔主席汇报了哈拉和林水利工程建设情况。他代表全体中国员工提出，永远不骄不躁，继续奋勇前进，保证提前胜利完成这个水利工程。欢迎大会举行以前，农牧场场长普尔布向周总理介绍了农牧场的情况。哈拉和林国营农牧场是一个以农业生产为主的农牧场，可耕土地达三万多公顷，今年已经播种了一万五千公顷。周恩来总理乘汽车前往参观农牧场正在修建中的水利灌溉渠道。在这里帮助建设的中国工程师李纬质向周总理和泽登巴尔主席汇报了修建情况。这个水利工程是去年6月开工的，现在已经完成全部工程的70％，修建完工可以灌溉八千公顷土地。
    周总理来到渠首，参观了水闸和水坝。关切地同中国技术人员谈到河水流量、水坝深度等各种问题。周总理还参观了水力发电站建设基地。
    周总理在哈拉和林草原上参观了几百年前修建的一座古庙——额尔登召。周总理并在留言簿上题词：
  “这个古堡大庙，是最好的历史教材，就是说，它可以从反面教育我们的后代，使他们知道旧时代的统治者，如何利用宗教迷信来奴役和压迫当时的劳动人民为这些反动统治者服务。但是，反动统治者早已不存在了，而劳动人民的劳动成果和艺术成就却永垂不朽。”
    随后，周恩来总理和泽登巴尔主席等从农牧场乘飞机到胡吉尔特参观疗养院。住在这里的两千多名牧民、疗养员等，齐集在飞机场向周总理欢呼。
    前杭爱省党委第一书记佐奥多尔在疗养院举行午宴招待周总理和他的随行人员。泽登巴尔主席等也出席了午宴。
    周总理参观了疗养院的浴室、医疗室等各种设备。这是一个矿泉疗养院，现在有来自全国各地的两百多名职工在这里疗养。
    周总理还观看了疗养院职工和疗养员们的歌舞演出。周恩来总理还到附近的一个畜牧业机器站参观了拖拉机和其他农业机器，周总理和机器站的负责人谈话，希望机器站充分利用机器，让机器经常转动，更多地增加生产。
    六点多钟，周恩来总理向胡吉尔特人民告别，人们分别在疗养院和飞机场列队欢送，一再向周总理欢呼，祝周总理一路平安。周总理和泽登巴尔主席等在下午七时半返回乌兰巴托。
