Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 29th. Hebei is actively planning mechanical cooperation for wheat harvesting to ensure that wheat is harvested and planted as it ripens, achieving high yields and bumper harvests.

This year, Hebei Province faces large summer harvest and planting tasks with a tight labor force. How to improve the mechanization and semi-mechanization of wheat harvesting and threshing is an important question. Because the wheat maturity periods differ between the northern and southern regions of Hebei Province, the two areas north of the Great Wall and the five areas south of the Great Wall have agreed on a method of mutually supporting large-scale wheat harvesting machinery: the number of machines participating in the cooperation will reach more than 180. According to statistics from relevant departments, through the cooperation and support of provinces both inside and outside the province, the area of ​​wheat mechanically harvested in Hebei Province this year will be many times larger than last year.

In order to give full play to the efficiency of the machinery, mechanical wheat harvesting headquarters have been successively established in various parts of Hebei Province, and agricultural, commercial, machinery manufacturing, transportation and other departments have jointly studied specific methods for a one-stop large-scale mechanical wheat harvesting collaboration, first doing a good job in machinery maintenance, personnel training and other work. As of May 20, 80% of the large-scale machinery in the province had been repaired, and a total of 7,500 combine operators, implement operators, and auxiliary personnel have been and are being trained.

Xinhua News Agency, 29th. A mobile harvesting team composed of fifty combine harvesters drawn from the Jiu San, Zhao Guang, Ke Shan and Er Long Shan four state farms in Heilongjiang Province has arrived in Wuhan to assist Hubei Province's wheat harvesting work. The mobile harvesting team includes 105 combine harvester operators from the four farms and 112 teachers and students from the Beijing Agricultural Mechanization Institute. This mobile harvesting team will assist Hubei, Henan, Hebei, Beijing and other provinces and cities in harvesting wheat in order from south to north along the Beijing-Hankou Railway.

The mobile harvesting team has been warmly welcomed in various parts of Hubei. Members of the Hengdian People's Commune in Huangpi County affectionately called the harvesting team members "people sent by Chairman Mao." In order to welcome the harvesting team, they quickly completed the work of repairing bridges and roads. Workers from the Jiang'an Vehicle Manufacturing Plant in Wuhan and the Hubei Tractor Manufacturing Plant enthusiastically assisted the harvesting team members in inspecting and repairing the machines, and the commercial departments in Wuhan specially cleared the warehouses to solve the need for some machine parts. With the cooperation and support of all parties, this batch of harvesting machinery has now been put into production.

In addition, 25 combine harvesters from Qinghai Province to support wheat harvesting in Shaanxi have also arrived at their destination. Of the 99 combine harvesters from Heilongjiang Province to support Hebei and Beijing, some are being shipped and some are en route.

This year, the scale of mechanical support for wheat harvesting in various places organized by the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Land Reclamation is very large. A total of 174 combine harvesters have been drawn from the Northeast and Northwest regions, in addition to 71 threshing machines. The areas receiving support include Shaanxi, Hubei, Henan, Hebei, Beijing and other provinces and cities.

    河北积极组织机械协作收麦
    黑龙江国营农场抽调大批机械支援湖北夏收
    新华社天津29日电　河北各地积极筹划机械收麦大协作，保证麦子随熟随收、随收随种、丰产丰收。
    今年河北省夏收、夏种任务大，劳力紧张，如何提高小麦收割、脱粒操作的机械化半机械化程度，是一个重要问题。由于河北省南北地区小麦成熟期不同，长城以北的两个地区和长城以南的五个地区，已协商好互相支援大型麦收机械的办法：参加协作的机械将达一百八十多台。据有关部门统计，通过省内和外省的协作支援，今年河北省麦子机械收割面积，将比去年扩大许多倍。
    为了充分发挥机械效能，河北省各地已相继成立了机械收麦指挥部，并由农业、商业、机械制造、运输等部门联合研究了机械收麦一条龙大协作的具体办法，首先做好机械检修、人员培训等工作。到5月20日为止，全省80％的大型机械已经检修完毕，已经和正在训练的康拜因手、农具手和辅助人员共达七千五百名。
    新华社29日讯　由黑龙江省九三、赵光、克山和二龙山四个国营农场抽调五十台联合收割机组成的流动收割队，已经到达武汉，协助湖北省的麦收工作。参加这个流动收割队的有四个农场的一百零五名联合收割机手，和北京农业机械化学院的一百一十二名师生。这个流动收割队将沿京汉铁路从南到北，依次协助湖北、河南、河北、北京等省市收麦。
    流动收割队在湖北各地受到热烈欢迎。黄陂县横店人民公社的社员亲切地把收割队员称作是“毛主席派来的人”。为了迎接收割队，他们很快地完成了修桥铺路的工作。武汉市江岸车辆修造厂和湖北拖拉机制造厂的工人热情地协助收割队员检验、修理机器，武汉市的商业部门专门清理了仓库，解决机器需要的一部分零件。在各方协作支援下，这批收割机械现在都已投入生产。
    此外，青海省支援陕西麦收的二十五台联合收割机也运抵目的地。黑龙江省支援河北和北京市的九十九台联合收割机有的正在启运，有的已在途中。
    今年由农业部和农垦部组织的机械支援各地收麦的工作规模很大。计从东北和西北地区抽调的联合收割机共达一百七十四台，另外还有七十一台脱粒机。受支援的地区包括陕西、湖北、河南、河北、北京等省市。
