Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Western European newspapers widely commented on the US plane's invasion of the Soviet Union, an act of aggression. The British "Daily Worker" emphasized that the United States carried out a provocative action on the eve of the summit conference, and it should call on people all over the world to pay attention to the conspiracies of the cold war supporters.

    The newspaper then pointed out that the new arrogant actions of the American militarists, who are irresponsible, have also caused strong unease among many officials in the United States and Britain. The newspaper called on all those who cherish peace to fight for the successful convening of the summit conference.

    The "Daily Worker" editorial on the 8th pointed out that after denial, evasion, and lying, the Americans finally had to admit that the plane shot down on May 1st (by the Soviet Union) was engaged in espionage activities. However, they shamelessly said that if the Soviet Union was not "excessively secretive," they would not have needed to engage in espionage. "This is like saying that if people don't insist on locking up their belongings, thieves don't need to come to steal them."

    The newspaper also pointed out that the United States, on the one hand, attempted to say that this flight was "not approved by the authorities," but on the other hand, it tried to say that this behavior was justified, talking a lot about the "necessity" of such provocative activities.

    The editorial in the French "l'Humanité" wrote, "It is quite certain that this incident clearly emphasizes how powerful and effective the Soviet Union's retaliation is when its territory is violated." The newspaper said that this also shows that the forces hostile to détente have not disarmed, so if people want peace to finally triumph over war, they must remain vigilant.

    "Libération" wrote, "The most important point of this incident is the United States' stubborn violation of the Soviet border, and the fact that other countries also participated in the conspiracy, thereby deliberately undermining the atmosphere of international détente."

    Italian newspapers have condemned the militaristic behavior of the United States. "l'Unità" believes that the US plane's violation of the Soviet border this time was "an outright provocation."

    "Avanti!" wrote that this violation "caused concern."

    Greek democratic newspapers believe that the warning issued by the Soviet Union regarding the provocative incident of the US plane's violation of the Soviet border has had a positive impact on the international situation and shows that all attempts to sharpen the international situation cannot but be met with a response from the socialist countries. "I Vradyni" pointed out that the US plane incident has caused "a bad impression" worldwide, even in the United States. "Avgi" pointed out that the US plane incident is a serious issue for Greece. The Greek government should pay great attention to the warning issued by the Soviet Union to certain countries that have US bases on their territory. "American bases are a magnet for death, and our country should get rid of this magnet as soon as possible."

    The Belgian "Le Drapeau Rouge" said that the US provocation is "a dangerous action against world peace." The newspaper condemned the US government for carrying out this extremely vile military provocation and demanded that the Belgian government withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization for the sake of national interests.

    西欧进步舆论谴责美国对苏联的挑衅
    世界人民必须警惕美国侵略阴谋
    据新华社讯　西欧报纸广泛评论美国飞机侵入苏联的侵略行为。英国“工人日报”强调指出，美国在最高级会议召开前夕进行了挑衅行动，应当号召全世界的人们注意到冷战拥护者的阴谋。
    这家报纸接着指出，美国军国主义者不负责的新的狂妄行动也引起了美英许多官方人士的强烈不安，报纸要求一切珍视和平的人为政府首脑会议的胜利召开进行斗争。
    “工人日报”8日的社论指出，美国人在否认、推诿和撒谎以后，最后不得不承认，在5月1日被（苏联）击落的飞机是去进行间谍活动的。但是，他们还厚颜无耻地说，如果苏联不是“过分的保密”的话，他们就没有必要进行间谍活动，“这等于说，如果人们不坚持把财物锁起来，贼就没有必要来偷东西”。
    这家报纸还指出，美国一方面企图说这架飞机的这次飞行是“没有经当局认可的”，但是另一方面又试图说这种行为是正当的，大谈“有必要”进行这样的挑衅活动。
    法国“人道报”的社论写道，“十分肯定，这件事件相当清楚地强调表明，苏联在其领土受到侵犯时进行的回击是多么有威力和有效”。报纸说，这件事还表明，敌视缓和的势力没有解除武装，所以如果人们希望和平最后战胜战争，就必须保持警惕。
    “解放报”写道，“这一事件最重要之点在于美国顽固地侵犯苏联边界，在于另外一些国家也参加了共谋，从而故意破坏国际缓和的气氛。”
    意大利报纸纷纷谴责了美国军国主义的行为。“团结报”认为美国飞机这次侵犯苏联国境是“道道地地的挑衅。”
    “前进报”写道，这一侵犯“引起了忧虑”。
    希腊民主报纸认为，苏联就美国飞机侵犯苏联国境的挑衅事件而提出的警告对国际局势起了良好的影响，并且表明了使国际局势尖锐化的一切企图不能不遭到社会主义国家的回击。“新闻报”指出，美国飞机侵犯苏联领土的飞行在全世界、甚至在美国也引起了“不良的印象”。“黎明日报”指出，美国飞机事件对希腊来说是一个严重的问题。希腊政府应当极大地注意苏联向某些在自己领土上设有美国基地的国家提出警告。“美国基地是一块死亡的磁铁，我国应当尽快摆脱这块磁铁”。
    比利时“红旗报”说，美国的挑衅是“反对世界和平的充满危险性的行动”。这家报纸谴责美国政府进行这种极为恶劣的军事挑衅，并且要求比利时政府为民族利益着想而退出北大西洋集团。
