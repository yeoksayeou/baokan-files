At the same time, 585 commune-run improved variety breeding farms and more than 8,000 management area improved variety farms (teams) have been built and expanded, an increase of about 30% compared to last year. In addition to breeding improved varieties of crops such as wheat and soybeans, many improved variety farms have also bred high-quality seeds for sugar beets, vegetables, and oil crops.
