Xinhua News Agency, New York, May 19th: The National Secretariat of the Communist Party USA issued a statement to the press condemning the provocative policies adopted by the U.S. government that undermined the four-power summit conference.

The statement said: The responsibility for the failure of the four-power summit should be borne by the stubborn Cold War supporters in the United States, because they have been manipulating and creating various conspiracies with the aim of undermining all serious negotiations on peace. This responsibility should be borne by the Eisenhower administration, because it is a participant in this double-dealing game.

The statement said: We cannot support or condone the current position taken by the Eisenhower administration, which brings shame to our country and leads to a situation in which the leader of any sovereign country cannot participate in talks.

The statement said: Cold War supporters are trying to use the current situation to clamor for expanding armaments, escalating international tensions, and inciting war hysteria. The American people should resist all such attempts and should express their desire for peace more loudly than ever.

The American weekly "National Guardian" published an editorial severely criticizing the U.S. government for sabotaging the four-power summit.

The "National Guardian" wrote that when Khrushchev made a statement at the preliminary meeting of the Paris summit, he had very good reason to be indignant. He was right to insist on an apology (from the U.S. government). The insult did not come from Khrushchev, as some newspapers insisted, but from the U.S. President. It is not Moscow, but Washington that is infringing on the sovereignty of other countries. Moreover, this act of infringing on the sovereignty of other countries did not begin on May 1 (when a U.S. military aircraft intruded into Soviet airspace), but is "the result of the U.S.'s consistent, established policy of provocation and threat over the past fifteen years."

    美共全国书记处斥美国政府破坏四国会议
    号召反击美国冷战势力
    据新华社20日讯　据塔斯社纽约19日讯：美国共产党全国书记处向报界发表了一项声明，谴责美国政府所采取的破坏了四国政府首脑会议的挑衅性政策。
    声明说：四国政府首脑会议失败的责任应当由美国顽固的冷战拥护者担负，因为他们一直抱着破坏一切有关和平的认真谈判的目的而玩弄手腕和制造种种阴谋。这方面的责任应当由艾森豪威尔政府担负，因为它是这个两面把戏的参加者。
    声明说：我们不能支持也不能原谅艾森豪威尔政府目前采取的立场，这种立场使我国遭到耻辱，并导致这样一种局势，在这种局势下，任何一个主权国家的领导人都是不能参加会谈的。
    声明说：冷战的拥护者企图利用当前的局势叫嚷扩充军备，加剧国际局势和掀起战争歇斯底里。美国人民应当对一切这样的企图给予反击，并且应当比任何时候都更加响亮地表达自己对和平的愿望。
    美国“国民前卫”周刊发表社论严厉抨击美国政府破坏四国首脑会议。
    “国民前卫”周刊写道，当赫鲁晓夫在巴黎首脑会议预备会议上发表声明时，他有非常充分的理由感到愤慨。他坚持要求（美国政府）道歉是正确的。侮辱不是像某些报纸硬说的那样来自赫鲁晓夫方面，而是来自美国总统方面。侵犯别国主权的也不是莫斯科，而是华盛顿。此外，这种侵犯他国主权的行动也不是5月1日（美国军用飞机侵入苏联领空）才开始的，而是“美国十五年来执行一贯的，既定的挑衅和威胁政策的结果”。
