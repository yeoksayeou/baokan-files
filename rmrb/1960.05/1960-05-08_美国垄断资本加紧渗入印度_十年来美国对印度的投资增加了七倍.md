Xinhua News Agency, 6th dispatch from New Delhi: American capital is intensifying its infiltration into India. American investment in Indian private industry has increased sevenfold in ten years.

It is reported that American private capital investment in India reached $164 million in 1959, compared to only $23.4 million in June 1948.

The pace of American investment currently tends to surpass that of Britain. For example, in 1957, American investment was $20.8 million, while British investment was only $12.6 million.

Sources say that the amount of American private capital investment will increase even more in the coming years due to a series of steps taken by India. The first of these steps is the exchange agreement signed between the Indian government and the US government, which stipulates that all profits earned by American investors in India can be freely converted into US dollars and repatriated to the United States. The second is the agreement on avoiding double taxation. This agreement was signed by the governments of India and the United States a few months ago. The third is an agreement recently signed by the Indian and US governments guaranteeing American investors against losses due to the Indian government taking over enterprises.

In addition, India has recently stipulated that new enterprises can be tax-free for the first five to ten years.

    美国垄断资本加紧渗入印度
    十年来美国对印度的投资增加了七倍
    由于印度采取的步骤　今后美国投资将增加更多
    新华社6日讯　新德里消息：美国资本正在加紧渗入印度。美国对印度私营工业的投资十年来增加了七倍。
    据报道，美国在印度的私人资本投资到1959年达一亿六千四百万美元，而1948年6月只有二千三百四十万美元。
    美国投资的速度目前有超过英国的趋向。例如1957年美国的投资是二千零八十万美元，而英国只有一千二百六十万美元。
    有消息说，由于印度采取了一系列的步骤，美国私人资本投资的数量在今后几年内将有更多的增加。这些步骤中的第一个是印度政府和美国政府签订了兑换协定，这项协定规定，美国投资者在印度赚到的一切利润可以自由兑换成美元汇回美国。第二是关于避免双重抽税的协定。这项协定是印度和美国两国政府在几个月前签订的。第三是印美两国政府最近签订的一项保证美国投资者不致于因为印度政府接管企业而遭到损失的协定。
    另外，印度最近还规定新企业在头五年到十年内可以免税。
