　　Light Cavalry on the Production Front
　　Zhang Ce, First Secretary of the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

    In the continuous Great Leap Forward of the past two years, more than 100,000 urban residents in Xi'an (most of whom are family members of workers) have enthusiastically participated in the production labor of state-owned industry, people-run industry, and the social service work of state-owned commerce and service industries. According to statistics from the Xincheng, Beilin, and Lianhu districts of Xi'an, 1,149 production and living service stations, production groups, and service groups have now been established. Other facilities such as public canteens for residents, kindergartens, nurseries, and consignment shops are also being established in various streets and alleys. In a very short period of time, a brand-new scene of scattered stars and blooming flowers has emerged.

    From the very beginning, production and living service stations have demonstrated their strong vitality and broad prospects for development. A large number of street industries and production groups have quickly established connections with state-owned industrial and commercial departments, processing and producing auxiliary materials, semi-finished products, or simple finished products according to the needs of factories and commercial departments. This newly formed production force not only creates social wealth for the country but is also increasingly becoming an important supplementary force and a strong assistant to state-owned industry. For example, when the Dahua Cotton Mill in Xi'an lacked sufficient hemp rope, the Golden Temple Street Production Service Cooperative used a large number of waste rope ends from the mill to process and produce 182 tons of good hemp rope, ensuring the mill's urgent needs. The Xianfeng Shoe Factory in Xi'an had insufficient shoe sole processing capacity, which often affected production. The Ziqiang Road Residents' Production Group took the initiative to undertake the shoe sole processing task, ensuring the completion of the factory's production tasks. These productions may seem simple, but they are important and indispensable. The masses, making do with whatever is available and starting from scratch, have quickly mobilized the production enthusiasm of the vast urban residents. Transforming the vast majority of urban consumers into an organized production force is undoubtedly a major victory in the process of transforming old cities and building new socialist cities. This production force can adapt to the time, adapt to the place, and adapt to the materials; fully utilize waste materials, turn useless things into useful things, and turn waste into treasure; it can carry out centralized production or decentralized production; it can carry out batch production or change products at any time, fill gaps, make up for deficiencies, and seize every opportunity. With the continuous improvement of the organization level and technical level of this production force, it will play an increasingly significant role in serving large-scale industry and serving the people's lives, becoming an indispensable and mobile production force in the city.

    While organizing residents to engage in production, the production and living service stations also actively organize public canteens, kindergartens, and nurseries, and widely undertake services such as dismantling, washing, sewing, and mending clothes and bedding, supplying boiled water, purchasing goods on behalf of residents, repairing doors, windows, and furniture, caring for patients, taking care of lying-in women, and handling savings on behalf of residents, becoming the "housekeepers" of the masses' lives. The socialization of housework has not only further liberated a large number of female laborers but also greatly reduced the housework burden for employed workers, enabling them to concentrate on better completing production and work tasks, and taking more time for political, professional, technical, and cultural learning. Now, a "everyone runs schools, everyone goes to school" learning movement is gradually being carried out in various streets and alleys. Residents of the Lianhu District have already established 37 amateur schools combining politics, professional skills, and culture, with an enrollment of more than 3,600 people. Some residents reflected: "Participating in the service station, jumping out of the housework circle, housework is not a burden, children are taken care of, busy with labor during the day, and reading books at night." This fully expresses the joyful and encouraging mood of the residents who are full of vigor and striving upward.

    With the rapid development of socialist construction, with the gradual socialization of housework and the gradual collectivization of life, the ideological outlook of urban residents is also undergoing profound changes. In the past, urban residents lived in individual households, and the scope of personal life was limited to the small world of their own families. This individual lifestyle restricted the liberation of people's minds and the development of the spirit of communist collaboration. Now, people participate in collective labor and live a collective life, and their minds have been greatly broadened. The past attitude of "everyone sweeps the snow in front of their own door" is being replaced by the collectivist thought of "everyone takes care of everyone's affairs, and everyone shares the difficulties of one family"; in the past, some neighbors were unfamiliar with each other, and even quarreled over some trivial matters in life, refusing to yield to each other, but now "streets become families, and passers-by become relatives," watching over doors, taking care of children, buying things on behalf of others, and helping each other. The new social custom of "working people are of one heart, helping each other is better than relatives" is being widely established. Moving deeds of respecting the old and loving the young, rescuing the sick and helping the wounded, putting others before oneself, and sacrificing oneself for others are also constantly emerging, fully demonstrating the spiritual outlook of the Chinese people living in the era of Mao Zedong.

    生产战线上的轻骑队
    中共西安市委第一书记　张策
    在两年的持续跃进中，西安市已有十多万城市居民（其中大部分是职工家属），踊跃参加了国营工业、民办工业的生产劳动和国营商业、服务事业的社会服务工作。据西安市新城、碑林、莲湖三个区的统计，现在已经建立起生产和生活服务站、生产小组和服务小组一千一百四十九个，其他如居民公共食堂、幼儿园、托儿所、代销店等也正在各个街巷普遍建立起来，在很短的时间内就出现了一个星罗棋布、繁花似锦的崭新局面。
    生产和生活服务站，一开始就显示了它的旺盛的活力和广阔的发展前景。大量的街巷工业和生产小组很快与国营工业和商业部门建立了联系，根据工厂和商业部门的需要，加工生产辅助材料、半成品或简单成品。这支新组成的生产队伍，不仅为国家创造了社会财富，而且日益成为国营工业的重要补充力量和有力的助手。例如西安大华纱厂麻绳供应不足，黄金庙街生产服务社就利用该厂大量的废绳头，加工制成一百八十二吨好麻绳，保证了该厂的急需。西安先锋制鞋厂本厂鞋底加工力量不足，常常影响生产，自强路居民生产小组主动承接了鞋底加工任务，就保证了该厂生产任务的完成。这些生产看起来很简单，然而却是重要的和不可缺少的。群众因陋就简，白手起家，迅速把广大城市居民的生产积极性调动起来。把绝大部分城市消费人口变成一支有组织的生产队伍，这无疑是改造旧城市、建设社会主义新城市过程中的一个重大的胜利。这支生产队伍可以因时制宜、因地制宜、因物制宜，充分利用废旧材料，化无用为有用，变废物为活宝；既可以集中生产，又可以分散生产；既可以成批生产，又可以随时变换产品，填空白，补缺门，见缝插针。随着这支生产队伍的组织程度和技术水平的不断提高，它在为大工业服务、为人民生活服务方面，必将日益发挥显著的作用，成为城市中一支不可缺少的、机动的生产力量。
    生产和生活服务站在组织居民进行生产的同时，还积极组织了公共食堂、幼儿园、托儿所，并广泛地承担了拆、洗、缝、补衣服被褥，供应开水，代购物品，修理门窗家具，护理病人，照顾产妇，代办储蓄等等服务工作，成为群众生活的“管家人”。由于家务劳动的社会化，不仅进一步解放了大批的妇女劳动力，而且给已经就业的职工大大减轻了家务负担，使他们能集中精力更好地完成生产和工作任务，抽出更多的时间进行政治、业务技术和文化学习。现在各街巷正在逐步开展一个“大家办学，大家入学”的学习运动。莲湖区的街巷居民已经自己办起了政治、业务、文化“三结合”业余学校三十七所，入学人数达三千六百多人，有的居民反映：“参加服务站，跳出家务圈，家务不拖累，孩子有人管，白天忙劳动，晚上把书念”。这充分表达了居民群众精神焕发、努力向上的欢欣鼓舞的心情。
    随着社会主义建设的飞跃发展，随着家务劳动的逐步社会化和生活的逐步集体化，城市居民的思想面貌也正在发生深刻的变化。过去城市居民都是一家一户地过日子，个人的生活范围局限在自己家庭的小天地里，这种个体生活方式束缚了人们的思想解放和共产主义协作精神的发扬。现在人们参加了集体劳动，过集体生活，胸襟大大地开扩了。过去的“各人自扫门前雪”的处世态度，正在被“大家的事情大家办，一家的困难大家担”的集体主义思想所代替；过去有些街坊邻里互不熟悉，甚至为一些生活小事发生争吵，互不相让，现在则“街道变家庭，路人变亲人”，代看门户，代管小孩，代买东西，互相帮助。“劳动人民心连心，互相帮助赛亲人”的新的社会风尚，正在广泛地树立起来。尊老爱幼、救病扶伤、先人后己、舍己为人的动人事迹，也在不断出现，充分表现了生活在毛泽东时代的我国人民的精神面貌。
