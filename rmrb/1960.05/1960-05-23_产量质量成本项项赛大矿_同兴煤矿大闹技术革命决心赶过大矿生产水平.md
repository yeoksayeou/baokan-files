Production, Quality, and Cost All Competing with Major Mines
Tongxing Coal Mine Launches a Technical Revolution to Surpass Production Levels of Major Mines

(Our Report) The Tongxing Coal Mine in Qijiang County, Sichuan Province, has set lofty goals, mustered great energy, and is competing with major mines. It is promoting the spirit of hard work and self-reliance, launching a vigorous technical revolution to transform and improve what was once a small, rudimentary mine without any coal mining faces, with combined mining and excavation, mining replacing excavation, entirely manual operations, and low and narrow underground roadways. Now it has become a small coal mine with regular mining and excavation faces, with underground and surface transportation basically semi-mechanized, and a well-connected transportation network.

Since August of last year, the mine’s production has continuously increased, with record-breaking output every month. Before August, the monthly production level was over 2,300 tons; in December, it surged to 117,493 tons, an increase of more than 39 times compared to August. It was awarded the honorary title of "Red Flag Coal Mine" by the municipal and county Party committees and received the "1959 First-Class Red Flag" award from the provincial Party committee and the "Large-Area High-Yield Red Flag" award from the Ministry of Coal Industry. This year, it continues to advance by leaps and bounds. In the first quarter, despite the transfer of 40% of the workforce to build roads, the raw coal production still exceeded the quarterly plan 15 days ahead of schedule. The total coal production in the quarter was equivalent to 70% of the total production for the entire last year; the average work efficiency of the entire mine reached over five tons, and the cost per ton of coal was 0.55 yuan.

Before August 1959, a few leading cadres in Tongxing Coal Mine had relatively serious right-leaning conservative ideas. They could not see the favorable conditions, could not see the strength of the masses, and exaggerated some temporary difficulties. Some believed that "small coal mines have insufficient equipment, and the increase in production is limited; a daily output of 250 tons cannot be exceeded," which hindered the leap in production. For example, the coal seam thickness in Mine No. 1 and Mine No. 2 was about the same, and the working face of Mine No. 1 was twice as large as that of Mine No. 2, and the number of production workers was also twice as large as that of Mine No. 2, but the output was less than one-third of that of Mine No. 2.

After combating right-leaning tendencies and boosting morale, the masses were mobilized to focus on the key to production and first concentrate on breaking through the coal mining method barrier. Regular roadways were laid out, coal mining faces were opened up, and coal mining tools were improved to make one tool serve multiple purposes. In terms of operational techniques, a complete set of operating methods was summarized, which not only improved safe production conditions but also increased production capacity and work efficiency. The output per working face increased from the original 20 tons per day to an average of about 600 tons per day, an increase of 29 times. Coal mining efficiency increased from 2 tons per worker to 12 tons, an increase of five times. This opened the first gate for high production.

With the continuous improvement of coal mining methods and operational techniques, work efficiency and output rapidly increased, and a new imbalance emerged where transportation could not keep up with production. To this end, the masses were mobilized to offer ideas and suggestions on how to improve transportation capacity. In terms of working face transportation, single-basket coal hauling was changed to train-style multi-basket coal hauling, and the daily coal transportation per worker increased from four tons to twelve tons, increasing work efficiency by two times. Although the transportation capacity increased, the volume of transportation still could not keep up with the needs of coal mining. The mine leadership adopted the suggestion made by hauler Zhang Zheng to use wooden chutes for coal transportation and gradually converted them into iron-wood combination chutes according to the conditions. This not only improved work efficiency by more than 50% compared to train-style basket coal hauling but also greatly reduced heavy manual labor, ensuring that the coal from the working face could be transported out in a timely manner. Then, the roadways were widened, the slopes were adjusted, and the originally used sledges were replaced with small mine cars on wooden rails; later, the single-track roadways were widened into double-track roadways. In this way, the underground transportation problem was completely solved, and as much as was mined was transported.

After solving the underground transportation problem, the problem of surface transportation not keeping up with the needs emerged again. What should be done? Therefore, they insisted on production while simultaneously transferring a large number of workers to rush to build roads. After more than two months of struggle, three kilometers of light-rail railway were built, and the ten-kilometer-long narrow wooden track was converted into a highway, which greatly improved the surface transportation capacity.

This year, the mine has extensively and deeply carried out technical innovation and technical revolution movements, continuing to carry out technical transformation, marching towards mechanization and semi-mechanization; further launching the large-area high-yield Red Flag competition, striving to comprehensively overfulfill the state plan. The workers firmly believe that although Tongxing Coal Mine is a small mine and its production technology is relatively backward, it is fully determined and confident to catch up with and surpass the production level of large mines. Their action slogan is: "Hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, set lofty goals, muster great energy, guarantee 3,000, strive for 5,000, compete with Zhongliangshan" (a large coal mine in Sichuan Province). The specific indicators are: 1. Output: This year's raw coal production plan is 74% higher than in 1959, and efforts will be made to complete the state plan seven months ahead of schedule. 2. Quality: The ash content is reduced to below 0.3%, a decrease of 40% compared to 1959. 3. Work Efficiency: The average overall work efficiency is five tons per worker. 4. Cost: The average cost per ton of coal is below 0.5 yuan. 5. Safety: Eliminate major casualty accidents, reduce the occurrence of minor injuries, and ensure safe production.

In order to complete the above tasks, they are seriously summing up and promoting advanced experiences, implementing the principle of mainly indigenous methods, combining indigenous and foreign methods, launching a vigorous technical revolution, changing manual operations to semi-mechanized operations, and gradually eliminating heavy manual labor. At the same time, comprehensively promote the advanced experiences of deep digging troughs, wide digging troughs, long stretching troughs, and hand-held drills, striving to always stay ahead of major mines.

    产量质量成本项项赛大矿
    同兴煤矿大闹技术革命决心赶过大矿生产水平
    本报讯　四川省綦江县同兴煤矿立大志，鼓大劲，赛大矿，发扬苦干、穷干的精神，大闹技术革命，使一个没有采煤工作面、采掘不分、以掘代采、全部手工操作、井下巷道又矮又窄的小土窑，改造提高成为有正规采、掘的工作面，井下和地面运输基本实现了半机械化，并形成四通八达运输网的小煤矿。
    去年8月以来，这个矿生产持续上升，月月高产。8月以前月产水平二千三百多吨，12月份就跃到一十一万七千四百九十三吨，比8月份增长了三十九倍多，获得市、县委“红旗煤矿”光荣称号，并获得省委“1959年度一级红旗”和煤炭工业部“大面积高产红旗”奖励。今年以来继续跃进，第一季度在抽调40％的职工修建公路的情况下，原煤产量仍提前十五天超额完成季度计划，全季产煤量相当于去年全年总产量的70％；全矿平均工效达到五吨以上，每吨煤的成本是零点五五元。
    1959年8月以前，同兴煤矿少数负责干部存在着比较严重的右倾保守思想，他们看不见有利条件，看不见群众的力量，夸大了某些暂时的困难，有的认为“小煤矿设备不足，增产有限，日产二百五十吨不能再多了”，结果妨碍了生产跃进。如一井和二井的煤层厚度差不多，一井的掌子面比二井多一倍，生产工人也比二井多一倍，产量反而不及二井的三分之一。
    经过反右倾、鼓干劲，发动群众针对生产关键，首先集中力量突破采煤方法关，正规布置巷道，开辟采煤工作面，并改进了采煤工具，作到一具多用。在操作技术上，总结出一套完整的操作方法，不但改善了安全生产条件，而且提高了生产能力和工效。工作面产量由原来日产二十吨，提高到平均日产六百吨左右，提高二十九倍，采煤工效由每工二吨，提高到十二吨，提高五倍。这就为高产打开了第一关。
    随着采煤方法和操作技术的不断改进，工效和产量迅速提高，出现了运输赶不上生产的新的不平衡。为此，又发动群众，围绕如何提高运输能力，出谋献计。在工作面运输方面，将单鸳箕拖煤改成列车式多鸳箕拖煤，每日每工运煤由四吨提高到十二吨，提高工效二倍。虽然运输能力增加了，但运量仍然跟不上采煤的需要。这个矿的领导上又采纳了拖工张正帮提出的改用木溜槽运煤的建议，并根据条件逐步改成铁木结合的溜槽。这样不但工效比列车式鸳箕运煤提高50％以上，而且大大减轻了笨重体力劳动，保证了工作面的煤能及时运出。接着又刷大了巷道，调整了坡度，把原来使用的拖子改成木轨小矿车运输；后来又把单轨巷道刷大成双轨巷道。这样，就彻底解决了井下运输问题，作到了采多少运多少。
    解决了井下运输之后，地面运输跟不上需要的问题又出来了。怎样办呢？于是，他们一方面坚持生产，一方面抽调大批职工突击修路。经过两个多月的战斗，修建了轻便铁路三公里，并将长十公里的小窄木轨道改为公路，这样，井上运输能力便大大提高了。
    今年来，这个矿又广泛深入地开展了技术革新和技术革命运动，继续进行技术改造，向机械化、半机械化进军；进一步开展大面积高产红旗竞赛，力争全面超额完成国家计划。职工们坚决地相信，同兴煤矿虽然是一个小矿，生产技术还比较落后，但完全有决心有信心赶上和超过大矿的生产水平。他们的行动口号是：“高举毛泽东思想红旗，立大志，鼓大劲，保三千，争五千，大赛中梁山”（四川省的大型煤矿）。具体指标是：一、产量：今年原煤生产计划比1959年提高74％，并力争提前七个月完成国家计划。二、质量：含?率降低到0.3％以下，比1959年降低40％。三、工效：平均全员工效五吨。四、成本：平均每吨煤零点五元以下。五、安全：消灭重大伤亡事故，减少轻伤事故的发生，确保安全生产。
    为了完成上述任务，他们正认真总结和推广先进经验，贯彻以土为主，土洋结合的原则，大闹技术革命，改手工操作为半机械化操作，逐步消灭笨重体力劳动。同时，全面推行深挖槽，挖宽槽，牵长槽，手搬钻等先进经验，力求做到经常赶在大矿的前面。
