Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 6th. Amidst the surging technical innovation and technical revolution movement, more than thirty small coal mines in Guangxi are rapidly transitioning to "small modern groups," transforming their appearance and boosting production.

Now, the underground working conditions of various small coal mines have been greatly improved. In terms of ventilation and drainage, simple equipment such as power machinery or self-made earthen blowers and earthen water pumps have replaced natural ventilation and manual drainage. The coal mines designated for renovation have also successively implemented "one network with five modernizations," including winch operation for inclined shaft hoisting, vehicle transportation on the surface, and wooden rail transportation in level tunnels. This has basically eliminated the heavy labor of carrying coal on people's backs and shoulders, thereby greatly increasing production efficiency. The region's small coal mines have already exceeded the 1 to 4 month coal production plan ahead of schedule. The first quarter's raw coal output is equal to 72.4% of the first half of last year's output, an increase of 20.2% over the same period last year, accounting for 70.2% of the autonomous region's total raw coal output in the first quarter of this year.

Most of Guangxi's small coal mines were established in 1958 using indigenous methods. Initially, the equipment was simple, and the operational technical level and production efficiency were not high. In order to change this situation, these coal mines have vigorously carried out renovations since the third quarter of last year. Many coal mines have replaced manual operations with simple machines in a short period, significantly improving production levels. Since the beginning of this year, these small coal mines have launched a technical innovation and technical revolution movement, achieving 120 relatively significant technical innovation projects in the first quarter alone. Adhering to the principle of "self-reliance, using local materials, and making do with whatever is available," they have adopted a combination of indigenous and modern methods to manufacture equipment, increasing the level of mechanization and semi-mechanization, and changing many backward coal mining methods. The Gonglou Coal Mine in Tianyang County manufactured foot-powered winches and hand-cranked/electric dual-purpose winches, and adopted ox-drawn trains, solving the contradiction between underground hoisting and transportation not being able to meet the needs of production, increasing daily output from more than 100 tons to more than 300 tons, and saving 46 workers.

People's Daily, Changsha, 6th. The Liangshitang People's Commune in Shaodong County, Hunan Province, has vigorously developed small indigenous coal mining groups, achieving remarkable results. Currently, the commune has five small coal mines with five pairs of coal shafts in production, four pairs of small modern coal shafts under construction, and 175 earthen coking furnaces. In the first quarter of this year, it produced more than 86,000 tons of bituminous coal, with an average daily output of more than 740 tons.

The commune's coal production developed after the establishment of the people's commune in August 1958. As soon as the commune was established, it actively organized the masses to vigorously mine coal while developing agricultural production. Subsequently, the commune vigorously engaged in small indigenous iron and steel production groups. The investment of hundreds of furnaces into production greatly promoted the development of coal production. More than 18,000 coal miners, under the leadership of the commune party committee, opened more than 500 pairs of small coal shafts in just ten days; by the end of the year, they had produced more than 36,000 tons of coking coal. Last spring, the small kilns were reorganized and improved, transforming the more than 500 pairs of small kilns into nine small coal mines, and extracting 5% of the commune's labor force, more than 1,700 people, to specialize in coal production. The commune party committee also selected 76 party member cadres who had mastered coal mining technology and assigned them to various work areas and work groups to eat, live, and labor with the workers, and to participate in and lead production. After this reorganization, the commune's coal and coke production entered a stage of planned development. In 1959, the commune's bituminous coal and coke production overfulfilled the annual plan 63 days ahead of schedule.

The Liangshitang People's Commune's vigorous development of coal and coke production has powerfully supported the iron and steel industry. Last year, in addition to the more than 50 tons of coke consumed by the commune's machinery factory, the rest was supplied to the Lianyuan Iron and Steel Plant, Zhuzhou Steel Plant, and the county's small modern iron plants.

This year, while doubling the output of bituminous coal and coal, the commune will also extract 180 people to engage in the construction of "small modern" coal shafts. This plan will be realized through technical innovation and technical revolution. After a series of technical innovations, earth-based mechanization has been achieved from underground hoisting to surface transportation. The workers' labor intensity has been greatly reduced, and production efficiency has increased from one to several dozen times compared to before. (Attached picture)

    发展和改造小煤矿  促进钢铁生产大跃进
    广西小煤矿快步向“小洋群”过渡
    湖南邵东县两市塘公社大搞采煤炼焦
    新华社南宁6日电　在轰轰烈烈的技术革新和技术革命运动中，广西各地三十多个小型煤矿快速向“小洋群”过渡，面貌为之一新，生产扶摇直上。
    现在，各小型煤矿井下劳动的条件大大改善了。在通风排水方面，以动力机械或自制的土鼓风机、土水泵等简易设备，代替了自然通风和人工排水。各定点改造的煤矿，还先后实现了斜井提升绞车化、地面运输车子化、平巷运输木轨化等“一网五化”，基本上消灭了用人背煤和肩挑煤的笨重劳动，生产效率因此大大提高。全区小型煤矿1至4月的产煤计划已提前超额完成，第一季的原煤产量等于去年上半年产量的72.4％，比去年同期提高20.2％，占自治区今年第一季度原煤总产量的70.2％。
    广西各地的小型煤矿大多数是在1958年以土法上马建设起来的。开始时设备简陋，操作技术水平和生产效率都不高。为了改变这种状况，这些煤矿从去年第三季度以来，就大力进行了改造，很多煤矿在短时期内就以简单的机器代替了手工操作，使生产水平有了显著提高。今年以来，这些小煤矿开展了技术革新和技术革命运动，在第一季度内就实现了较为重大的技术革新项目一百二十项。他们本着“自力更生、就地取材、因陋就简”的方针，采取土洋结合的办法自造设备，使机械化半机械化程度有了提高，许多落后的采煤方法有了改变。田阳县公篓煤矿，制造了脚踏绞车和手摇、电动两用绞车，并且采用牛拉列车，解决了井下提升、运输不能适应生产发展的矛盾，使日产量由一百多吨提高到三百多吨，并且节省了四十六个工人。
    本报长沙6日电　湖南邵东县两市塘人民公社大办煤炭小土群，收到了显著效果。现在这个公社有小型煤矿五个，生产煤井五对；正在进行基本建设的小洋群煤井四对；有土炼焦炉一百七十五个。今年一季度生产了烟煤八万六千余吨，平均日产量达七百四十多吨。
    这个公社的煤炭生产是在1958年8月建立人民公社之后发展起来的。公社一成立，就在发展农业生产的同时，积极组织群众大力采煤。接着公社大搞钢铁“小土群”，上百座炉子的投入生产，大大地促进了煤炭生产的发展。一万八千余名采煤大军，在公社党委的领导下仅仅十天的时间，就开了五百多对小煤井；到年底生产了三万六千多吨焦煤。去年春天，对小窑井进行了整顿和提高，把五百多对小窑井，整理成九个小型煤矿，抽出全社5％的劳动力一千七百多人专门从事煤炭生产。公社党委会还选拔了七十六名掌握了采煤技术的党员干部分配到各工区、垱头，与工人同吃、同住、同劳动，参加生产领导生产。经过这一整顿，全社的煤焦生产，就进入了有计划发展的阶段。1959年全社的烟煤和焦炭提前六十三天超额完成了年计划。
    两市塘人民公社大搞煤焦生产，有力地支援了钢铁工业。去年全公社生产的焦炭，除公社机械厂用去五十多吨以外，其余都供应了涟源钢铁厂、株洲钢厂等及本县的小洋群铁厂。
    今年，这个社在烟煤和煤炭产量比去年翻一番的情况下，还要抽出一百八十人搞“小洋群”煤井的建设。这个计划，将通过技术革新和技术革命来实现。经过一系列的技术革新，目前从井下提升到地面运输，已经实现了土机械化。工人的劳动强度是大大减轻了，生产效率比以前提高了一倍至几十倍。（附图片）
