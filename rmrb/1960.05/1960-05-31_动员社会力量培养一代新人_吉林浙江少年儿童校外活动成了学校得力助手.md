 Mobilizing Social Forces to Cultivate a New Generation
 Jilin and Zhejiang少年儿童校外活动成了学校得力助手

 This newspaper reports: Jilin Province's youth and children are participating in various extracurricular activities in an organized manner and are receiving good education. Currently, 600,000 youth and children in cities such as Changchun, Jilin, Siping, Tonghua, Baicheng, and Yanji are participating in various extracurricular activities in an organized manner and are achieving good results.

 Extracurricular activity venues for youth and children in various cities have been established with the help of many government offices, factories, enterprises, and the broad masses of workers, staff, and residents, based on the principles of adapting to local conditions and making use of existing materials and equipment. Currently, the entire city has established 139 "Children's Palaces," 420 children's clubs, 13 children's parks, and 12,267 Young Pioneer extracurricular detachments. Tens of thousands of children participate in various meaningful activities in these venues every day after school or on holidays. Most schools use cinemas, cultural centers, clubs of government offices and enterprises, and free time in private canteens to organize activities for young people. Middle and primary schools also organize students living near each other into Young Pioneer extracurricular detachments to carry out extracurricular activities in an organized manner. According to statistics from 14 cities and counties alone, there are more than 12,000 Young Pioneer extracurricular detachments. The activities of the detachments include reviewing lessons, doing homework, holding detachment meetings, reading groups, and various recreational and sports activities.

 Extracurricular activities for youth and children have become an effective classroom for schools to conduct communist education for children, effectively cooperating with schools in the education of youth and children. Through various meaningful extracurricular activities, the broad masses of youth and children love the Party, love socialism, love labor, and care for the collective. Class 2 of Grade 5 of Liu Malu Primary School in Siping City used to be a notorious class for not abiding by discipline in the whole school. After school education and organized extracurricular activities, it has become a model class for abiding by discipline.

 This newspaper reports: Young Pioneer organizations in various parts of Zhejiang Province have launched colorful extracurricular activities for youth and children.

 The most common and frequent activities are scientific experiments in planting and crop cultivation. Small farms for youth and children have been generally established throughout the province. According to statistics from 14 counties alone, there are more than 3,800. Children use washbasins to irrigate and combat drought in small farms, catch toads as fertilizer, and create "Red Scarf bumper harvest fields." The Young Pioneer Orchard in Huangyan County has planted longan from Fujian and apples from the north, calling for the "meeting of north and south fruits." Now, they are experimenting and cultivating a multi-variety tangerine tree that simultaneously grows golden kumquats, vermilion tangerines, and "local early tangerines."

 Jiaokou Primary School in Changhua County has established a Youth Academy of Sciences. Under the cultivation and education of the Party, they have set great ambitions at a young age and promoted the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act. Since this year, they have successfully experimented and cultivated 50 new varieties of various crops. Including the new varieties successfully tested in the past few years, the Youth Academy of Sciences has now successfully cultivated nearly 100 new varieties of various crops.

 This Youth Academy of Sciences has a total of 42 members, the oldest is 17 years old and the youngest is 8 years old.

 For more than six years since the establishment of the academy, they have been carrying out various cultivation experiments in agricultural experimental fields, cultivating sunflowers as big as washbasins; corn with 31 cobs, large rice with three grains connected to one inch and three points long, and "Jiaoxian" rice weighing one catty with less than 10,000 grains. In livestock farms, they raise various high-quality breeds of pigs, sheep, chickens, ducks, rabbits, and other livestock and poultry. Among them are large goats weighing 81 catties, produced by crossbreeding sheep and goats, and improved new fur rabbits. In the industrial department, there are small pesticide factories and forest product chemical plants, which have produced more than 30 kinds of local pesticides and many chemical raw materials. They also built a "Youth Meteorological Observatory" using indigenous methods to disseminate meteorological information to nearby agricultural production teams in a timely manner. Now, they are carrying out "thousand species" experiments, striving to cultivate 120 new varieties of rice and 80 new varieties of corn, breed large pigs and large goats, and manufacture more and better forestry chemical industrial products.

 The political consciousness and cultural knowledge of the members of the Youth Academy of Sciences have also improved rapidly. They are all "three good students" and Young Pioneers, and 13 of them have joined the Communist Youth League.

    动员社会力量培养一代新人
    吉林浙江少年儿童校外活动成了学校得力助手
    本报讯　吉林省少年儿童有组织地参加了各项校外活动，并受到良好教育。目前，长春、吉林、四平、通化、白城、延吉等市共有六十万少年儿童有组织地参加了各项校外活动，并且收到良好效果。
    各城市少年儿童校外活动场所，都是在许多机关、工厂企业和广大职工、居民群众的帮助下，本着因地制宜、因陋就简的原则，利用旧有器材和设备建立起来的。现在全城市已建立了“少年宫”一百三十九所，儿童俱乐部四百二十个，儿童公园十三个，少先队校外小队部一万二千二百六十七个。成千上万的儿童每天放学之后或假日就在这些场所开展各项有意义的活动。各学校大都利用电影院、文化馆、机关企业的俱乐部和民办食堂空闲时间组织少年进行活动。各个中、小学校还把住家相近的学生，组成校外少先队小队部，有组织地开展校外活动。仅据十四个市县的统计，共有少先队校外小队部一万二千多个。小队部的活动有复习功课、做作业、开小队生活会、读书会和各种文体活动。
    少年儿童的校外活动，已经成为学校对儿童进行共产主义教育的得力课堂，有效地配合了学校对少年儿童的教育。广大少年儿童通过校外各种有意义的活动，热爱党、热爱社会主义和热爱劳动，关心集体。四平市六马路小学五年级二班，过去是个全校有名的不守纪律的班，通过学校教育和有组织的校外活动之后，变成了守纪律的模范班。
    本报讯　浙江省各地少先队组织少年儿童开展了丰富多彩的校外活动。
    活动中最普遍和最经常的是种植和农作物栽培的科学试验。全省各地普遍建立了少年儿童小农场，仅据十四个县的统计就有三千八百多个。孩子们在小农场里用脸盆灌水抗旱，捉癞蛤蟆当肥料，创造“红领巾丰产田”。黄岩县县小的少年百果园里种了福建的桂圆和北方的苹果，叫南北水果“会师”。现在，他们正在试验、培育出一株同时长出金钱蜜桔、朱红桔和“本地早桔”的多品种桔树。
    昌化县交口小学办了一所少年科学院，在党的培养教育下，人小立大志，发扬了敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格，今年以来，试验和培育成功了五十种各种农作物新品种，加上过去几年中试验成功的新品种，现在，这个少年科学院已经培育成功近一百个各种农作物新品种。
    这个少年科学院一共有四十二个成员，年纪最大的十七岁，最小的八岁。
    建院六年多，他们在农业实验园地里进行着各种栽培试验，培育出了像脸盆一样大的向日葵；长三十一个棒的玉米，三粒谷接连起来就有一寸三分长的大稻谷，以及不到一万粒就有一斤重的“交籼”稻等。他们在畜牧场里，饲养着各种优良品种的猪、羊、鸡、鸭、兔等家畜家禽。其中有绵羊与山羊杂交而产生的重八十一斤的大山羊，有改良的新型皮用兔。在工业系里，办有小农药厂和林产化工厂，已经制成了三十多种土农药和不少化工原料。他们还土法上马办起了一个“少年气象台”，及时向附近农业生产队传布气象消息。现在，他们正在开展“千种”试验，争取培育一百二十种水稻新品种和八十种玉米新品种，培养大猪、大山羊，以及制造更多更好的林业化学工业产品。
    这个少年科学院成员的政治觉悟和文化知识也提高得很快，都是“三好学生”和少先队员，其中有十三个人已经加入了共青团。
