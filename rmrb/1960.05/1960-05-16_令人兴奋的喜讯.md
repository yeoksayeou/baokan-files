    Exciting Good News
    By Our Correspondent
    The exciting good news that the world's first spaceship satellite has flown into space has spread from Moscow all over the world yesterday. Soviet scientists and engineers successfully launched a 4,540-kilogram Earth spaceship satellite into its predetermined orbit, taking another giant step forward for mankind in its journey to achieve interstellar travel.

    The weight of this Earth spaceship satellite launched by the Soviet Union, not counting the last stage of the launch vehicle, is 4,540 kilograms. This is more than twice as heavy as the heaviest third Earth satellite previously launched by the Soviet Union, and five times heavier than the American "Pioneer VI" satellite. Such a heavy Earth satellite significantly demonstrates the unparalleled power of Soviet rocket thrust. Unlike ordinary Earth satellites, the huge volume of this Earth spaceship satellite enables it to carry complete equipment necessary for human flight. Undoubtedly, this launch laid the foundation for the complex work of manufacturing spaceships that can ensure the safe flight of humans in space, thus greatly bringing the day closer when humans can board spaceships.

    Two days before the Soviet spaceship successfully entered orbit, on May 13, the United States also launched a so-called "giant satellite." It is said that the United States originally planned to use this satellite to broadcast US President Eisenhower's speech at the summit conference. Unfortunately, contrary to expectations, this satellite disappeared after launch. The Soviet spaceship roams space, while the American "balloon satellite" has no way to go to heaven. This stark contrast once again shows that the Soviet Union is throwing the United States further and further behind in science and technology. The superiority of socialism is once again vividly presented to the people of the world.

    令人兴奋的喜讯
    本报评论员
    世界上第一个宇宙飞船卫星飞往宇宙的喜讯，昨天已经从莫斯科传遍了全世界。苏联科学家和工程技术人员把一个重达四千五百四十公斤的地球飞船卫星成功地送上了预定轨道，使人类在实现星际旅行的征途中又跨出了巨大的一步。
    苏联发射的这个地球飞船卫星的重量，不算运载火箭的最后一级，为四千五百四十公斤。这比苏联过去所发射的最重的第三个地球卫星还重两倍多，比美国的“先驱者”六号卫星重达五倍。这样重型的地球卫星，显著地表明了苏联火箭推力的无比强大。这个地球飞船卫星同一般的地球卫星不同，它的巨大的体积，使它已能带有为人的飞行所需的完善设备。无疑，这次发射奠定了制造保证人在宇宙中安全飞行的可能的宇宙飞船的复杂工作的开端，从而使人类登上宇宙飞船的日子大大临近了。
    在苏联宇宙飞船顺利地进入轨道的前两天，即5月13日，美国也发射过一枚所谓“巨型卫星”。据说，美国原准备用这个卫星来转播美国总统艾森豪威尔在最高级会议上的发言的。可惜事与愿违，这个卫星发射后就不知下落。苏联的宇宙飞船遨游太空，美国的“气球卫星”上天无路。这一鲜明的对比，又一次表明了苏联在科学技术方面把美国抛得越来越远了。社会主义的优越性，又一次生动地呈现在全世界人民面前。
