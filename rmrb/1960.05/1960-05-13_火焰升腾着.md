    Flames are rising,
    In Masan,
    Flames are rising,
    In the southern land.
    In the South,
    Hunger and rags spread through towns and villages,
    Life is withering and turning yellow.

    Flames are spreading,
    In Masan,
    Flames are spreading,
    In the southern land,
    In the South,
    The people have lost their rights and freedom,
    Only the smell of gunpowder permeates all around.

    Flames of hatred soaring to the sky,
    Flames burning away all sins,
    Blazingly rising,
    Roaring,
    Burning across the mountains and plains.

    Washing away all filth,
    Destroying all oppression,
    Flames are fiercely rising,
    Spreading,
    In the sinful southern land,
    In the ravaged land.

    Burn, expand,
    Flames,
    Burn away all injustice and tyranny,
    Burn away all ugliness and scum,
    The unified new day is coming!

    火焰升腾着
    〔朝鲜〕朴八阳火焰升腾着，在马山，火焰升腾着，在南方的土地上。在南方，饥饿和褴褛遍布城乡，生命在枯萎发黄。火焰扩展着，在马山，火焰扩展着，在南方的土地上，在南方，人民丧失权利、自由，只有火药味在弥漫四方。直冲九霄的仇恨的火焰，烧毁一切罪恶的火焰，熊熊地升腾着，呼啸着，烧遍了山野和平原。洗净一切污秽，摧毁一切压迫，火焰猛烈地升腾着，扩展着，在罪恶的南方土地上，在被蹂躏的土地上。燃烧吧，扩展吧，火焰啊，烧毁一切不义和横暴，烧毁一切丑恶和败类，统一的新日子到来了！
