Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, May 4th: The Cambodian government and people are preparing to warmly receive Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai and his entourage, who will arrive here tomorrow. The capital of the Kingdom of Cambodia has been adorned with new splendor. From Pochentong Airport to the Royal Palace, the roads are decorated with green archways and the national flags of China and Cambodia. Banners hanging in the streets read: "Welcome Premier Zhou Enlai," "Long Live Sino-Cambodian Friendship," "Long Live Peaceful Coexistence," and "Long Live World Peace." The trees and walls along the way have been painted white.

The Cambodian National Radio Station issued a call to residents this morning, saying: "Tomorrow, go to the airport enthusiastically to cheer and welcome our great friend and honored guest. The great People's Republic of China welcomed our Prince very solemnly when he visited Beijing. This is a great honor for our Prince and our country. In order to show that the Cambodian people are highly civilized and cherish friendship, let us solemnly welcome our honored guests!"

Since April 23rd, members of the Cambodian Royal Socialist Youth League have been rehearsing programs every afternoon to welcome the Chinese Premier.

The same enthusiasm prevails in all provinces. Workers at the Royal Textile Factory of Cambodia, built with Chinese assistance, are organizing a crash program to complete the basic construction and mechanical installation two months ahead of schedule and begin trial production to welcome the visit of the Chinese Premier.

Whether in Kampot Province or Siem Reap Province, the Cambodian people are working hard to receive the Chinese guests sincerely and warmly. Overseas Chinese have also actively participated in these efforts. They eagerly hope to see the leaders of their motherland.

According to local newspaper reports, all administrative organs will be almost closed tomorrow. Civil servants, especially members of the Cambodian Royal Socialist Youth League, will go to Pochentong Airport and along the route to be taken by the Chinese Premier to express their warm respect to the Chinese Premier.

Local newspapers have also published many articles and editorials to welcome the Chinese Premier.

"Cambodia Telegram" wrote today, "Cambodia is proud and eager to see once again those figures whose noble character and international prestige are beyond description, and who have very successfully exposed the myth of colonialism, enabling the Chinese people and many other nations to dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to do."

The newspaper also said that colonialists often slander oriental countries, portraying the people of oriental countries as barbaric and inferior races, saying that they "do not even deserve any pity." Our country will follow the example of great China, and under the wise leadership of Prince Sihanouk, be good at firmly fighting the very obvious sense of inferiority that so-called friends create in us psychologically.

Today's editorial in "Unity Daily" said, "Whenever Cambodia is threatened, the People's China always expresses sympathy to us. In the past three years, when the imperialists used force to attack Cambodia, China always encouraged us morally. Now that the imperialists are further threatening Cambodia, the Chinese friends have again brought friendship and encouragement to the Cambodian people. This has aroused the joy of the people and made the imperialists realize that Cambodia is not isolated and should not be underestimated."

The newspaper also said, "On the other hand, Premier Zhou Enlai's visit once again refutes the imperialist slander that communist China will annex small countries. On the contrary, this visit shows that China is a close friend, truly loves peace and justice, and is the pillar of independence and peace for the weak and small countries in Southeast Asia."

    金边披上美丽新装  到处洋溢友好气氛
    柬埔寨人民准备热烈欢迎周总理
    “统一报”说中国是一个真正爱好和平的亲密的朋友
    新华社金边4日电　柬埔寨政府和人民准备热烈地接待将于明天到达这里的中国总理周恩来和他的随行人员。柬埔寨王国的首都已经穿上了美丽的新装，从坡成东机场到王宫的道路上，装饰着绿色的牌楼和中柬两国国旗，街上挂的横幅标语上写着：“欢迎周恩来总理”，“中柬友好万岁”，“和平共处万岁”，“世界和平万岁”；沿路的树木和围墙都已涂成白色。
    柬埔寨国家电台今天上午向居民发出号召说：“明天热烈地到机场上去，向我们的伟大朋友和贵宾欢呼和表示欢迎。伟大的中华人民共和国在我们亲王访问北京时曾非常隆重地欢迎他，这是我们亲王的、也是我们国家的巨大荣誉。为了表示柬埔寨人民是高度文明的，和珍重友谊的，隆重地欢迎我们的贵宾吧！”
    从4月23日起，柬埔寨皇家社会主义青年联盟的成员们在每天下午都排演为欢迎中国总理而演出的节目。
    在各省，到处洋溢着同样的热情。中国援助建设的柬埔寨皇家纺织厂的工人正在组织一个突击运动以便提前两个月完成基本建设和机械安装工程，并开始进行试车生产，来欢迎中国总理的访问。
    无论是在唝吥省或暹粒省，柬埔寨人民正在为诚挚而热烈地接待中国贵宾们而紧张地工作着。华侨也积极地参加了这些工作。他们热望看到祖国的领导人。
    据这里报纸报道，明天所有的行政机关几乎都将放假，公务员特别是柬埔寨皇家社会主义青年联盟成员将到坡成东机场和中国总理所要经过的沿途去，热烈地向中国总理表示敬意。
    这里的报纸也发表了许多文章和社论来欢迎中国总理。
    “柬埔寨电讯报”今天写道，“柬埔寨对于它将再一次看见那些人物感到自豪和急切，他们非常高贵的人品和国际声望是无庸赘述的，他们非常成功地揭露了殖民主义的神话，使中国人民和许多其它国家人民能够敢想、敢说、敢做”。
    这家报纸还说，殖民主义者经常诽谤东方国家，把东方各国人民描写成野蛮的低劣种族，说他们“甚至不值得任何一点的怜悯”。我国将效仿伟大的中国，在西哈努克亲王的英明领导下，善于坚定地同所谓的朋友们使我们在心理上产生的非常明显的自卑感展开斗争。
    “统一报”今天的社论说，“每当柬埔寨受到威胁的时候，人民中国总是对我们表示同情，最近三年来，当帝国主义者用武力进攻柬埔寨的时候，中国总是在道义上给我们鼓励。现在帝国主义者正在进一步威胁着柬埔寨，中国朋友们又给柬埔寨人民带来了友谊和鼓励。这引起了人民的欢欣，使帝国主义者认识到，柬埔寨不是孤立的，不应当受到轻视。”
    这家报纸还说，“另一方面，周恩来总理的访问再一次驳斥了帝国主义者所谓共产党中国吞并小国的谰言，相反地，这次访问表明，中国是一个亲密朋友，真正爱好和平和正义，中国是东南亚各弱小国家的独立与和平的支柱。”
