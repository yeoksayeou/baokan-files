Xinhua News Agency, London, 23rd: 1,500 members of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament in London held a demonstration here on May 22nd, condemning the United States for sabotaging the four-power summit conference and demanding the withdrawal of American nuclear bases in Britain.

John Collins, chairman of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, who was unable to attend the march, pointed out in a letter that, in his view, "the Western powers' collusion before the four-power summit conference," the United States' shocking actions in the U-2 plane incident, and the United States' implementation of military alert before the start of the four-power summit conference, were all manifestations of a lack of sincerity.

The demonstrators carried signs that read: "No American hydrogen bomb bases, and no U-2 aircraft," "Is Britain a Pentagon puppet?" and "Disarm immediately!"

The annual meeting of the National Men's Cooperative Guild held in Birmingham over the weekend also unanimously condemned the United States for sending spy planes to invade the Soviet Union on the eve of the four-power summit as "completely irresponsible."

    不要美国的氢弹基地
    伦敦一千五百人游行示威
    新华社伦敦23日电　伦敦地区的争取裁减核军备运动的一千五百名成员5月22日在这里举行示威游行，谴责美国破坏四国政府首脑会议，要求撤消美国在英国的核基地。
    因事没有参加这次游行的争取裁减核军备运动主席约翰·柯林斯在一封信中指出，在他看来，“西方在四国政府首脑会议前的勾结”，美国在U—2机事件上的令人震惊的行动，以及美国在四国政府首脑会议开始前实行军事警戒的行动，这一切都是缺乏诚意的表现。
    示威者拿着标语牌，上面写道：“不要美国的氢弹基地，也不要U—2型飞机”，“英国是五角大楼的傀儡吗？”和“立刻裁军！”等字样。
    周末在伯明翰举行的全国男子合作公会年会也一致谴责美国在四国政府首脑会议前夕派间谍飞机入侵苏联是“完全不负责任”。
