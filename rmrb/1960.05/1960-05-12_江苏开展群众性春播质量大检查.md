Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing: Jiangsu Province is conducting a mass inspection and comparison campaign during the spring planting season to further improve the quality of spring planting and ensure full and robust seedlings on every mu planted. Currently, the planting of corn, sorghum, millet, and cotton has basically concluded throughout the province, and spring sweet potatoes, peanuts, soybeans, and early rice are being rushed into planting. Early-planted crops have generally emerged and are growing vigorously.

This year, the spring planting area in Jiangsu Province has expanded by more than 4 million mu compared to last year. At the same time, over 2.74 million mu of various crops have been planted using "ten-edge" vacant land. The specifications and quality of spring planting are better than in previous years.

After the sowing was completed, all localities organized inspection teams and specialized seedling inspection and replanting teams to go deep into the fields, inspecting each item, comparing while inspecting, and comparing with each other. Fengxian County organized seedling inspection and replanting teams in every commune and production team, implementing the practice of bringing fertilizer, pesticides, seeds, and water to the fields, inspecting, comparing, and replanting simultaneously. Seeds were replanted on 5,000 mu of spring-planted crops, ensuring sufficient seedlings per mu. Lianshui County launched a "five inspections and five replantings" campaign, mobilizing cadres and the masses to inspect the area and replant seeds, inspect specifications and replant ridges, inspect missing seedlings and replant seeds, inspect basal fertilizer and replant seedling fertilizer, and inspect pests and replant poisoned grain.

    江苏开展群众性春播质量大检查
    据新华社南京电　江苏省各地在春播中，开展了一个群众性的大查大比运动，进一步提高春播质量，保证所播作物亩亩苗全，棵棵苗壮，垅垅苗齐。目前，全省的玉米、高粱、谷子、棉花已基本播种结束，一部分春山芋、花生、大豆和早稻正在突击抢栽抢种。早播作物已普遍出苗，生长茁壮。
    今年，江苏省春播面积比去年扩大四百多万亩；同时，利用“十边”空隙地种植各种作物二百七十四万多亩。春播的规格质量都比往年好。
    各地在播种一结束，都组织了检查团和查苗补苗专业队，深入田间，项项过目，边查边比、互查互比。丰县社社队队组织查苗补苗队，实行带肥、带药、带种、带水下田，边查边比边补，有五千亩春播作物补足了种子，保证了每亩足苗。涟水县发动干部群众开展查面积、补播种，查规格、补畦田，查缺苗、补种子，查基肥、补施苗肥，查虫害、补施毒谷的“五查五补”运动。
