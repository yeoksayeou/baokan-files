    Strive for Overall Product Quality Improvement

    After winning the national championship for the intrinsic quality of daily-use enamel products, the Xi'an People's Enamel Factory continues to advance victoriously, proposing to make the quality of industrial enamel products catch up with and surpass Shanghai.

    Since 1957, the Xi'an People's Enamel Factory has consistently been at the forefront of the country in terms of the quality of daily-use enamel products. This year, the factory has also successfully trial-produced more than forty new products, many of which are the first of their kind in the national enamel industry, such as hexagonal flowerpots and imitation lacquer large vases. However, the quality of industrial enamel products still lags behind Shanghai. Recognizing this objective fact, they sent people to fraternal factories in Shanghai to learn advanced experience this year, and formulated a plan to learn from and catch up with Shanghai, determined to strive to catch up with or surpass Shanghai in the quality of industrial enamel products before "July 1st."

    产品质量全面争上游
    西安人民搪瓷厂夺得日用搪瓷制品内在质量全国冠军之后，继续乘胜前进，提出要让工业搪瓷制品质量赶上和超过上海。
    西安人民搪瓷厂自1957年以来，日用搪瓷产品质量一直居于全国先进行列。今年这个厂还试制成功了四十多种新产品，有不少品种是全国搪瓷工业第一次制作的产品，如六角花盆，仿漆大花瓶等。但是工业搪瓷产品质量还赶不上上海。他们看清了这一客观事实，今年曾连续派人到上海兄弟厂学习先进经验，并制订了学上海、赶上海的规划，决心在“七一”以前，力争工业搪瓷制品的质量赶上或超过上海。
