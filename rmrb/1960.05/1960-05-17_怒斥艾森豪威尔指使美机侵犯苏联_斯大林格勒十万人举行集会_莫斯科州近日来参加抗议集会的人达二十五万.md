    Denouncing Eisenhower's Direction of US Aircraft to Invade the Soviet Union
    100,000 People Rally in Stalingrad
    250,000 People in the Moscow Region Participate in Protest Rallies in Recent Days
    Xinhua News Agency report: On the 13th, 100,000 workers in Stalingrad held a rally in "Martyrs' Square," denouncing the US government and its head, Eisenhower, for directing US aircraft to invade Soviet airspace in a provocative act.
    The meeting took place amidst passionate anger. A large banner at the venue read: "Let all aggressors know that none can escape retribution, whether they are masterminds or accomplices, all will get what they deserve," fully expressing the anger and determination of the participants.
    Riga Lin, secretary of the Stalingrad Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Andreyev, secretary of the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, and representatives from all walks of life spoke at the meeting. In their speeches, they sternly condemned the invasion of US aircraft and enthusiastically supported the resolute actions taken by the Soviet government in response. They pointed out that this behavior of the US imperialism has aroused the condemnation of all the Soviet people and all progressive humanity.
    Steelworker and Socialist Labor Hero Xie Erkov from the "Red October" steel plant said in his speech: The steelworkers in our plant feel extremely indignant at the shameless invasion of our country by US aircraft. The hatred of the US reactionary group towards our country has reached the extreme. This behavior is not accidental. We fully and completely support taking resolute measures to stop the aggressors. We did not rebuild our beloved Stalingrad from the ruins for nothing. We will never allow Stalingrad to be turned into ruins for a second time!
    The conference unanimously passed a resolution stating that we denounce the attempt by the United States to re-escalate international tensions and undermine the summit meeting. We are indignant that this flight of the US aircraft was carried out under the orders of the US government and US President Eisenhower. Eisenhower even shamelessly justified this aggressive flight as "necessary" for collecting intelligence.
    The resolution said that we fully and completely support the resolute actions taken by our government in eliminating the American aerial bandits. Glory to the Soviet soldiers and officers who have excellently performed their military duties! We call on our troops to act with such firmness and strength in the future. If imperialism dares to invade, our armed forces will surely inflict a devastating blow, and imperialism will cease to exist.
    The resolution concluded by saying that we assure the Party and the Soviet government that we will consolidate the economic and defense strength of our country and the entire socialist camp with selfless labor. We must continue to raise our revolutionary vigilance and be ready at all times to defend peaceful labor, so that the army will always maintain a high level of combat readiness.
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 15th: In recent days, working people across the Soviet Union have continued to hold mass rallies, angrily protesting and denouncing the shameless crime of US aircraft invading Soviet airspace.
    In the past few days, more than 600 mass rallies have been held in the Moscow region, with 250,000 people participating in these rallies.
    At a rally at the Moscow Second Ball Bearing Factory, fitter Saljin said indignantly: We denounce the provocateurs. The Soviet people are invincible. No conspiracy of the warmongers can scare us.
    At a rally of employees at the "Lenin Forging Iron Factory" in Kiev, worker Shelny Shenko said that speaking hypocritically about peace while hiding a murderous weapon in their arms is the truth about the American reactionaries. Only enemies of peace would send spy planes to invade Soviet airspace before the summit meeting is about to be held. But they should not forget that the Soviet Union will mercilessly punish uninvited guests.
    Ramazanov, a worker at the Stalin Oil Refinery in Baku, said at a rally that it would be very beneficial for Eisenhower to personally listen to what the Baku workers are saying, and he will know how strong the anger of the Soviet people has been aroused by the provocative activities of the US military aircraft. He said that the Soviet Union is strong and invincible, and the truth is on our side. The shameless statements of the American ruling group can only increase their shame.
    Officers and soldiers of various combat units of the Soviet Union, who were angered by the American aggression, have also held rallies in recent days. At a rally of a unit of the Pacific Fleet, sailor Lomov said that the imperialists are continuing to wield their weapons, so we must continue to strengthen our combat readiness. Let the American invaders know that any act of robbery will be punished as it deserves.

    怒斥艾森豪威尔指使美机侵犯苏联
    斯大林格勒十万人举行集会
    莫斯科州近日来参加抗议集会的人达二十五万
    本报讯　13日，斯大林格勒十万劳动者在“烈士”广场上举行集会，痛斥美国政府及其首脑艾森豪威尔指使的美机侵犯苏联领空的挑衅行为。
    大会是在群情激愤的情况下进行的。会场上的大幅标语：“让所有的侵略者都知道，一个也逃避不了报应，主谋也好，仆从也好，都将各得其所”，充分表达了与会者的愤怒和决心。
    苏共斯大林格勒市委书记日加林，共青团市委书记安德列也夫以及各界代表都在会上讲了话。他们在发言中严正谴责了美机的侵犯行为，并热烈拥护苏联政府对此采取的坚决行动。他们指出美帝这种行为已引起全体苏联人民，及全进步人类的指责。
    “红十月”钢铁厂炼钢工人、社会主义劳动英雄谢尔科夫在发言中说道，我们厂的钢铁工人对美机对我国无耻的侵略行为感到极大的愤慨。美国反动集团对我国的仇恨已达到极端了。这次的行为不是偶然的。我们全力、充分支持采取坚决的措施，制止侵略者。我们并不是白白地把自己亲爱的斯大林格勒从废墟中重建起来的。决不容许斯大林格勒第二次再变成废墟！
    大会一致通过了一项决议，决议中说，我们痛斥美国想重新加剧国际紧张局势和破坏最高级会议的企图。我们感到愤怒的是，美机的这次飞行是遵照美国政府和美国总统艾森豪威尔的命令进行的。艾森豪威尔还恬不知耻地证明这种侵略飞行是搜集情报所“必需的”。
    决议说，我们完全、充分支持我国政府在消灭美国空中强盗上采取的坚决行动。光荣归于卓越地执行了自己军职的苏联士兵和军官！我们号召我们的军队，今后行动也要这样的坚决有力。帝国主义胆敢侵略，我国的武装力量，定会给予歼灭性的打击，而帝国主义也将不再存在。
    决议最后说，我们向党和苏联政府保证，我们将以忘我的劳动来巩固我国和整个社会主义阵营的经济和国防力量。我们今后仍要不断提高我们的革命警惕性，时刻准备着保卫和平的劳动，使军队永远保持战斗准备的高度水平。
    新华社莫斯科15日电　苏联各地劳动人民连日来继续举行群众集会，愤怒抗议和痛斥美国飞机侵犯苏联领空的无耻罪行。
    莫斯科州近几天来举行了六百次以上的群众集会，参加这些集会的人达二十五万之多。
    在莫斯科第二滚珠轴承制造厂的集会上，钳工萨尔金激愤地说，我们痛斥挑衅者，苏联人民是不可战胜的。战争贩子的任何阴谋诡计都吓不倒我们。
    在基辅的“列宁锻铁厂”的职工集会上，工人谢尔尼申科说，口是心非地谈和平，而怀里却藏着凶器，这就是美国反动派的真相。只有和平的敌人才会在最高级会议即将召开之前派遣间谍飞机侵犯苏联领空。但是他们不应该忘记，苏联是毫不留情地惩罚不速之客的。
    巴库的斯大林石油加工厂的工人拉马扎诺夫在集会上说，如果艾森豪威尔亲自听一听巴库工人在讲些什么，这是对他很有好处的，他将会知道美国军用飞机的挑衅活动，激起了苏联人民多么强烈的愤怒。他说，苏联是强大无敌的，真理在我们这一边。美国统治集团的无耻声明，只能更增加他们的耻辱。
    为美国的侵略行动所激怒的苏联各战斗部队的官兵连日来也纷纷举行集会。在太平洋舰队某部的集会上，水兵洛莫夫说，帝国主义者在继续挥动武器，因此我们要不断地加强战斗准备。要让美国侵略者知道，任何强盗行为都将受到应有的惩罚。
