    Ant Hill
    Yang Shuo
    When I first arrived in Ghana, I noticed some strange little hills in the wilderness, all made of very fine yellow earth. The tall ones were several yards high, with tops as sharp as cones. They looked very delicate. What on earth were these strange things? Bakao, the gatekeeper of the ambassador's hotel, told me: these are the famous ant hills of Black Africa.
    The ants in Africa look quite ordinary. They are just a little bigger, and they often use a section of a cut-off tree stump as a framework, carrying grains of soil little by little to build upwards. Day after day, month after month, season after season, year after year, millions upon millions of ants, with such amazing perseverance, labor tirelessly, and over the years, they finally build astonishing ant hills. In Bakao's words: it's simply the skyscraper of the ant world.
    Bakao was a very eye-catching character. In his forties, he had a row of medals jingling on his chest. With his chest puffed out, he was always tidying up his faded old uniform. He seemed full of energy. Every strand of his black hair was curly, so tightly curled that a half-pencil stuck in his temple wouldn't fall out. The first time he saw me, he looked at me with smiling eyes, as if he had something to say, but didn't want to speak first. One afternoon, during tea time, I came back from outside and noticed his kind gaze again, so I greeted him first, asking about those strange little hills.
    Bakao belonged to the type of person: straightforward and talkative, if you ask him one question, he will patiently tell you a hundred. He first told me what the ant hills were, then asked, "Are you from China?"
    I nodded, and he smiled, giving a thumbs up and saying repeatedly, "Good! Good!" Then he said, "During World War II, I followed the British army to Burma to fight against Japan, and I saw many Chinese people, some of whom were my friends."
    I said "Oh" and said, "No wonder you got so many medals."
    Bakao straightened the hem of his old uniform, puffed out his chest even higher, showing a proud look, then suddenly sighed and said, "I got a lot of medals, but unfortunately they can't be eaten. After the fight against Japan, I retired and became unemployed, wandering the streets, having to beg for food. At that time, I don't know how many unemployed veterans like me there were, extremely hungry, everyone gathered together, discussed it, and all shouted: Let's go find the British Governor! So we rushed to the Governor's mansion like a swarm of bees..."
    Just as he was talking about this, a car drove up and stopped in front of the ambassador's hotel. Bakao went up as usual, opened the car door, and respectfully stepped aside. A middle-aged man got out of the car, wearing a colorful floral shirt with many small wild animals printed on it, which looked very strange - I recognized him as an American journalist named Gitz. Gitz said softly, "Thank you," and slipped a shilling into Bakao's hand, and gently walked into the hotel. At this time, cars were coming and going in front of the hotel, and Bakao was busy greeting people here and there, and couldn't continue the conversation, so I went to the hotel's outdoor cafe to wait for a Black African friend.
    Gitz happened to be sitting opposite me. As soon as I arrived in Ghana, I paid special attention to every American. I couldn't help but pay attention, they were the main adversaries I was secretly fighting against. Please think, I brought the Chinese people's deep friendship, flew over high mountains and vast seas, to Accra, the capital of Ghana, to participate in the All-African People's Conference. Unexpectedly, among the flags hanging in the venue, two flags of the People's Republic of China were hung on the right, while on the left, two flags of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang were hung. The four flags faced each other from afar, clearly a deliberately arranged "two Chinas" conspiracy. Who was the enemy of the Chinese people? You can guess. It turned out that more than thirty Americans had come to the conference, all with glowing titles such as professors, scholars, and journalists, trying to secretly manipulate the conference. They bought off representatives everywhere in advance, vigorously promoted non-violent policies, and now they were staging the ugly drama of "two Chinas," intending nothing more than to undermine the unity of the African people, to undermine the unity of the Asian-African, especially the Sino-African people, so as to paralyze and divide the struggle of the African people. I refused to participate in the conference. I visited all the African friends I knew, explained China's solemn position, and exposed the enemy's conspiracy to undermine the friendship between the Chinese and African people. African friends woke up and immediately launched a fierce struggle against the American running dogs within the conference, demanding that the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's flags be torn down. Requesting the brotherly representatives of People's China to enter the venue. The struggle had been going on for two days, and the outcome was still undecided.
    Now sitting opposite me was one of the roles I was secretly fighting against. Gitz had very heavy sideburns, and his shaved cheeks were iron-blue; his eye sockets were also blue. A young waiter with a dark complexion walked over and asked him if he wanted tea or coffee. Gitz said with a warm air, "Thank you, I want a glass of iced mango juice."
    After a while, the waiter brought the mango juice on a tray. Gitz first looked at the waiter and chuckled for a while, then said softly, "Thank you, dear baby."
    Perhaps sensing that I was secretly paying attention to him, Gitz suddenly raised his face and smiled at me, greeting me very solicitously, "It's really a dark continent, and the weather makes it unbearably hot - don't you think so, sir?"
    I pretended not to hear and ignored him. That guy went further and said, "I studied witchcraft in the East, and if you don't mind, sir, I would like to tell you: I'm afraid you are facing something unpleasant?"
    I controlled my emotions and said with a smile, "I also studied witchcraft in the West, and if you don't mind, I would like to tell you, misfortune has already befallen your head."
    Gitz was startled and said, "Can you tell me what the misfortune is?"
    I said, "Whatever unfortunate seeds you sow, you will reap unfortunate fruits."
    That guy laughed, "Wonderful, this is truly Eastern wisdom. Forgive me, sir, I can't accompany you any longer." Then he stood up, bowed politely, and just as he turned around, I saw him making a face from the glass door.
    I couldn't wait for the African friend I had arranged to meet, a little anxious, I strolled back to the hotel. The gatekeeper Bakao was resting in the shade of the coconut trees, waving to me from afar. Why not take this opportunity to ask Bakao to continue talking about his story?
    Bakao naturally loved to talk, he picked up the previous topic and said, "Didn't I tell you we all went to the British Governor's mansion? The Governor's mansion is where the Ghanaian government is now located. Before we got to the gate, a group of British soldiers blocked our way. We wanted to see the Governor, but they let us see bayonets first. Everyone was extremely angry, shouting loudly: 'We want jobs! We want bread!' The British soldiers opened fire, killing two veterans. This aroused the anger of the Ghanaians. That night, a riot broke out in Accra, and all around you could hear shouting: Independence! Freedom! This was in 1948, and it was the first time the Ghanaians uttered the cry for freedom. Although the riot later subsided, the people's determination to demand independence became stronger and stronger. Until March 1957, the British saw that the situation was not right, and then changed their tricks, letting Ghana become independent. But what kind of independence is this? -"
    Bakao's words suddenly stopped, and he cried out in pain. It turned out that a pale hand had quietly reached to his temple, gently propping up the pencil inserted in his curly hair, causing his hair to ache. I turned around and saw: Gitz standing behind me, baring his teeth.
    Gitz put on a very solicitous air and said to Bakao, "Forgive me, my dear, can you help me call a car?"
    Bakao's face turned black-purple with anger, he took out his whistle and blew it a few times, and a car drove up to the hotel entrance. Gitz raised his foot to get into the car, and a few ants happened to be crawling on the road. I heard Gitz gritting his teeth and whispering, "A few black ants, can they stop my way!" Saying that, he stepped on the ants with the tip of his foot, crushed them all, and then climbed into the car.
    Bakao spat in the dust raised by the car, and said angrily to me, "Did you see that? The British and Americans are still riding on our heads, acting arrogantly, what kind of independence is this!"
    This reminded me of the words of a Ghanaian political figure. He said, "If Africa is not completely independent, Ghana will not get truly consolidated independence." This time, representatives from all over Africa gathered together precisely to determine a common path, to completely destroy the shackles of imperialism and colonialism, and to achieve the complete liberation of Africa. No matter if it is a jackal or a tiger, if it wants to block the path of the African people, it will only suffer its own consequences. If you don't believe it, look at the sensational story that happened that evening.
    When I went into the restaurant for dinner, I only heard a lot of discussions, and everywhere there was a rumor about a piece of news, saying that the conference was holding a secret meeting that day, and when the discussion reached the most heated point, a person guarding the basement ran over and said: there was a dark shadow hiding in the basement, from where the secret of the entire meeting could be clearly overheard. Two policemen immediately rushed to the basement, caught the man, and it turned out to be an American spy. Everyone said that the evening newspaper also had a photo of that spy.
    I hurriedly finished dinner and wanted to buy an evening newspaper. As soon as I got to the door, the gatekeeper Bakao rushed to me, holding a newspaper in his hand and saying, "Take a look, I didn't expect it to be him!"
    The newspaper published the photo of that Gitz, with an eye-catching headline below: Can he deny that he is not a spy?
    While I was still looking at the news, the African friend I had been waiting for suddenly appeared in front of me, patted me on the shoulder and smiled, "Come to the conference tomorrow. The conference has decided this afternoon to tear down Chiang Kai-shek's flags tonight."
    Before I entered the venue the next day, I first asked someone else to go in and take a look, only one flag had been taken down, and the other was still hanging. Thanks to Mrs. Robertson and Mrs. Du Bois, due to their righteous struggle, they had no choice but to tear down the other dirty flag under the eyes of everyone.
    I entered the venue, and many African friends shook hands with me and said, "This is your victory!"
    But I think this is even more of an outstanding victory for the African people against American imperialism. As long as the American pirates can control the venue and the destiny of the African people, Chiang Kai-shek's flags cannot be taken down. Looking at the impassioned emotions in the venue, who can not be deeply moved? This one ran onto the stage and shouted three times: "Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!" The entire venue was shaken. That one was carrying a big sign, stood on the stage, and the slogan written on the sign immediately became the voice of the crowd's uncontrollable anger: Imperialists get out of Africa! Suddenly someone sang in a tragic soprano: Africa, come back!
    For a time, inside the venue, outside the venue, there was a deafening chorus. I felt that this singing was not only inside and outside the venue, not only in Ghana, but was surging throughout the entire African continent. ...
    Since the All-African People's Conference in 1958, more than a year has passed in the blink of an eye. The African people's anti-colonial struggle is really in full swing, with wave after wave higher than the last. That American spy once scolded the African people as black ants, did you ever think that African ants can build ant hills and create amazing miracles! What's more, what the African people are currently creating is by no means an ant hill, but truly magnificent mountains. It is said that every time a volcano erupts, a new mountain is born. At present, throughout Africa, volcanoes are erupting everywhere, and the red-hot lava forms rivers of fire, burning everywhere. In the midst of this volcanic eruption, new peaks are being born one after another on the African continent.

    蚁山
    杨朔
    乍到加纳，我几次发觉旷野里有些奇奇怪怪的小山，都是极细的黄土堆成的。高的高到好几丈，顶儿像锥子一样尖。显得十分精巧。究竟这是些什么蹊跷玩艺儿？大使旅馆的守门人巴考告诉我说：这就是黑非洲有名的蚁山。
    非洲的蚂蚁模样儿也寻常。只是略微大点，时常借着一段砍剩的枯树桩子做梁架，一点一点衔着土粒往上垒。一天一月，一季一年，千千万万蚂蚁抱着那样惊人的毅力，无休止地劳动着，年深日久，终于垒成令人惊叹的蚁山。用巴考的话来说：这简直是蚂蚁世界的摩天大厦。
    巴考是个怪惹眼的人物。四十几岁，前胸挂着一排叮叮当当响的勋章。挺着胸脯，老是整理自己那身褪色的旧军装。显得满有精神。他的黑头发每根都鬈曲着，鬈的那样紧，鬓角插着半支铅笔，也不掉。头一次看见我，他就用含笑的眼睛望着我，似乎有话要说，又不好先开口。有一天午后，正是喝茶的时候，我从外头回来，又发觉他那好意的眼神，便先跟他打招呼，问起那些奇怪的小山。
    巴考属于那种性格：爽快而又多话，你问一句，他会不厌其烦地说一百句。他先告诉我蚁山是什么，接着问道：“是从中国来的么？”
    我点点头，他就满脸是笑，伸出大拇指头连声说：“好！好！”随后又说：“第二次世界大战，我随英国军队到缅甸跟日本打过仗，看见许多中国人，有的还是我的朋友呢。”
    我噢了一声说：“怪不得你得到这样多勋章啊。”
    巴考整理整理旧军装的下摆，胸脯挺得更高，露出得意的神气，忽然又舒口气说：“勋章是得了不少，可惜不能当饭吃啊。打完日本后，我退伍回来，就失了业，流落街头，得伸手向人要着吃。当时像我这样失业的退伍兵不知有多少，饿极了，大伙聚集一起，一商量，都叫：找英国总督去！我们就一窝蜂似的奔着总督府去了……”
    刚谈到这儿，一辆汽车开到大使旅馆门前停下，巴考照例走上去，打开车门，恭恭敬敬闪到旁边。车里走出个壮年汉子，穿着一件五颜六色的花衬衫，上头印着许多小野兽，怪里怪气的——我认得这是个叫吉茨的美国记者。吉茨柔声说了句：“谢谢，”往巴考手里塞个先令，轻轻走进旅馆去。这时旅馆门前车来车去，巴考忙着东招呼，西招呼，顾不得继续谈话，我就到旅馆的露天咖啡厅去等候一位黑非洲朋友。
    吉茨恰好坐在我的对面。我一到加纳，对每个美国人都特别留意。我不能不留意，他们是我正在暗中斗角的主要敌手。请想想，我带着中国人民海样深的情谊，飞越高山大海，到加纳的首都阿克拉来参加全非人民大会。不曾想在会场悬挂的旗子当中，右边挂着两面中华人民共和国的国旗，而在左边，竟吊着两面蒋匪帮的旗子。四面旗子遥遥相对，明明是故意布置好的“两个中国”的阴谋。是谁在跟中国人民为敌呢？猜也猜得着。原来有三十多个美国人来到大会，顶的都是教授、学者、记者一类发光的头衔，企图暗中操纵大会。他们事前到处收买代表，极力宣扬非暴力政策，现在又搬演“两个中国”的丑剧，用意无非要破坏非洲人民的团结，破坏亚非特别是中非人民的团结，这样来麻痹分割非洲人民的斗争。我拒绝参加大会。我遍访所有我认识的非洲朋友，说明中国的严正立场，揭露敌人损害中非人民友情的阴谋。非洲朋友醒悟了，立时在大会内部对美国走狗展开激烈的斗争，要求扯下蒋匪帮的旗子。请人民中国的兄弟代表进入会场。斗争已经持续两天，胜负未分。
    现在坐在我对面的正是跟我暗中角斗的角色之一。吉茨的连鬓胡子极重，刮的脸颊铁青；眼窝也是青的。一个脸色黑亮的年青侍役走过来，问他喝茶还是喝咖啡。吉兹透着一股亲热劲儿说：“谢谢你，我想要一杯冰浸芒果汁。”
    不一会儿，侍役用托盘送来芒果汁。吉茨先望着侍役嘿嘿嘿笑了一阵，然后柔声说：“谢谢你，亲爱的宝贝儿。”
    也许觉察到我在暗暗注意他，吉茨忽然抬起脸朝我一笑，怪殷勤地招呼说：“真是个黑暗大陆啊，天气也使人热的难受——你说是不是，先生？”
    我假装没听见，不睬他。那家伙进一步说：“我在东方学过巫术，如果你不见怪的话，先生，我想告诉你：恐怕你正面临着什么不愉快的事情吧？”
    我控制一下自己的感情，笑着说：“我在西方也学过巫术，如果你不见怪，我倒想告诉你，不幸已经降临到你的头上。”
    吉茨一惊说：“你能告诉我是什么不幸么？”
    我说：“你撒的什么不幸的种籽，就要收什么不幸的果实。”
    那家伙嘿嘿嘿笑起来：“妙啊，这真是东方的智慧。原谅我，先生，我不能再多陪伴你了。”便站起身，客客气气一鞠躬，刚转过身去，我从玻璃门里望见他扮了个鬼脸。
    我总等不到那位约好的非洲朋友，有点急，蹓蹓跶跶又转到旅馆。门口守门人巴考正坐在蔻蔻树荫凉里歇凉，老远便朝我招手。何不趁这个空请巴考继续谈谈他的故事呢？
    巴考自然爱谈，他拾起先前的话头说：“我不是告诉你我们都奔着英国总督府去了么？总督府就是现在加纳政府的所在地。不到大门口，一群英国兵迎头拦住我们的去路。我们要见总督，人家却让我们先见见刺刀。大伙气极了，高声叫着：‘我们要职业！我们要面包！’英国兵就开了枪，打死两个退伍兵。这一来，可激起加纳人的气愤。当天晚间，阿克拉全城都发生暴动，四处只听见喊：独立！自由！这是1948年的事，也是加纳人头一次发出自由的呼声。暴动虽说后来平静下去，人民要求独立的决心却越来越强。直到1957年3月，英国人看见势头不对，才改变花招，让加纳独立。可是这算什么样的独立呢？——”
    巴考的话突然停住，痛楚地叫了一声。原来有只苍白的手悄悄伸到他的鬓边，轻轻一撑插在他鬈发里的铅笔，撑得他的头发生痛。我回头一看：吉茨吡着牙立在我背后。
    吉茨做出一股怪殷勤的劲儿对巴考说：“原谅我，我的亲爱的，你能帮我喊一辆汽车么？”
    巴考的脸气得变成黑紫色，掏出哨子吹了几声，一辆汽车开到旅馆门前。吉茨抬脚要上汽车，几只蚂蚁正巧爬在当路上。只听见吉茨咬着牙小声说：“几只黑蚂蚁，还能挡住我的路啦！”说着用脚尖踏住蚂蚁，只那么一碾，把蚂蚁都碾死了，然后爬进汽车去。
    巴考冲着汽车扬起的尘土吐了口唾沫，气愤愤地对我说：“你看见没有？英国人和美国人还骑在我们头上，横行霸道，这算什么独立！”
    这使我记起一位加纳政界人物的话。他说：“如果非洲不全部独立，加纳就得不到真正巩固的独立。”这次全非洲的代表聚会一堂，正是要确定一条共同道路，连根摧毁帝国主义和殖民主义者的枷锁，取得非洲彻底的解放。任它是豺狼虎豹，如果想要挡住非洲人民前进道路，只有自讨苦吃。不信请看当天傍晚发生的一件哄动听闻的故事。
    吃晚饭的时候，我一进餐厅，只听见议论纷纷，到处哄传着一件新闻，说是当天大会正开秘密会议，讨论到最热烈的当儿，一个看守地下室的人跑来说：地下室里藏着个黑影，从那儿可以清清楚楚偷听到整个会议的秘密。两个警察立时赶到地下室，捉住那个人，竟是一个美国特务。都说晚报上还登着那个特务的照片呢。
    我匆匆忙忙吃完饭，想去买一份晚报。刚到门口，守门人巴考便冲到我面前，手里擎着张报纸说：“你看看吧，想不到是他啊！”
    报上登的正是那个吉茨的照片，下面还有一行醒目的标题：他能否认不是个特务么？
    我还在细看新闻，那位我一直等待着的非洲朋友突然出现在我眼前，拍拍我的肩膀笑道：“明天你来参加大会吧。大会今天下午已经作出决定，今晚上就扯掉蒋介石的旗子。”
    第二天我进会场以前，先请别人进去一看，只摘掉一面，还挂着另一面。感谢罗伯逊夫人和杜博依斯夫人，由于她们的正义的斗争，才不得不在万目睽睽之下，于是把另一面肮脏旗子也扯下来了。
    我进入会场，许多非洲朋友跟我握手说：“这是你们的胜利啊！”
    我却认为这更是非洲人民对美帝国主义所取得的一次出色的胜利。但凡美国海盗还能掌握会场，还能掌握非洲人民的命运，蒋匪帮的旗子是摘不下来的。看看会场上那种慷慨激昂的情绪，谁能不深受感动？这个跑上台去，连叫三声：“自由！自由！自由！”整个会场都震动起来。那个扛着块大牌子，往台上一立，牌子上所写的标语立时变成群众的怒不可遏的声音：帝国主义滚出非洲去！突然有人用悲壮的高音唱道：阿非利加，回来吧！
    一时会场里头，会场外头，满是一片震耳欲聋的歌声。我觉得，这歌声不止在会场里外，也不止在加纳，而是在整个非洲大陆上都汹涌起来。……
    自从1958年全非人民大会以来，转眼又是一年有余。非洲人民反殖民主义的斗争真是如火如荼，一浪高一浪。那个美国特务曾经骂非洲人民是黑蚂蚁，你想没想到非洲的蚂蚁能够垒起蚁山，创造出惊人的奇迹！何况非洲人民目前正在创造的决不是蚁山，却是真正雄伟的大山。据说，每次火山爆发，就要有新山诞生。现时在整个非洲，火山到处在喷火，通红的熔岩形成火的河流，到处都在燃烧。就在这一片火山爆发声中，新的山峰正在非洲大陆上一个接着一个诞生出来了。
