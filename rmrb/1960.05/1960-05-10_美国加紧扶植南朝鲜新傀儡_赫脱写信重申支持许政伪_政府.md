Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 8th: Seoul dispatch: U.S. "Ambassador" to South Korea, McConaughy, delivered a letter from U.S. Secretary of State Herter to Xu Zheng, the "acting president" of South Korea, on the 7th. The letter reiterated U.S. support for Xu Zheng's "government."

McConaughy held talks with Xu Zheng for nearly two hours. According to reports, they discussed accelerating the so-called "U.S. aid projects" as a step by the United States to support this unstable puppet group. In addition, they also discussed the relationship between Japan and the South Korean puppet government. The United States is attempting to woo them in order to realize its plan to piece together a Northeast Asian aggressive military alliance. According to news, the American "advisers" working in the police and propaganda agencies "Public Information Office" of the South Korean puppet government, who had been hiding at home for some time out of fear of the powerful struggle of the South Korean people against the heinous rule of the U.S.-Syngman Rhee group, have now returned to work.

According to an Associated Press report, the American "advisers" working in these two agencies stayed home longer than other "U.S. aid" officials, because "these agencies were closely related to the fraudulent elections of March 15."

According to the Associated Press, some Americans have suggested that the United States "conduct a large-scale training program" for the South Korean police.

The South Korean puppet government is unhesitatingly adopting fascist means to suppress the South Korean people and the opposition. When nearly a thousand students from Hanyang Industrial High School in Seoul held a demonstration on the 7th demanding the expulsion of the school's reactionary principal, the puppet government mobilized troops to suppress them. The troops fired tear gas several times, and one student was injured. These troops also charged at the demonstrating students and about two thousand people gathered around the students with bayonets, forcing them to disperse.

On the same day in Seoul, the puppet government also sent troops to disperse a gathering aimed at organizing a new political party. The military curfew authorities said their gathering was "prohibited." The curfew authorities also took the two initiators of the meeting away for "interrogation."

### 美国加紧扶植南朝鲜新傀儡  赫脱写信重申支持许政伪“政府”

    美国加紧扶植南朝鲜新傀儡
    赫脱写信重申支持许政伪“政府”
    新华社平壤8日电　汉城消息：美国驻南朝鲜“大使”麦克瑙吉7日向南朝鲜的“代理总统”许政递交了美国国务卿赫脱的一封信，信中重申美国支持许政的“政府”。
    麦克瑙吉同许政进行了将近两小时的谈话。据报道，他们商谈了加速进行所谓“美援工程”的问题，作为美国支撑这个不稳的傀儡集团的一个步骤。此外，他们还商谈了日本和南朝鲜傀儡政府的关系问题。美国正企图加以拉拢，以实现其拼凑东北亚侵略军事同盟的计划。消息说，在南朝鲜傀儡政府的警察机构和宣传机构“公报室”工作的美国“顾问”，前一个时候，由于害怕南朝鲜人民反对美国—李承晚集团罪恶统治的强有力的斗争，一直躲在家里，现在他们又回去工作了。
    据美联社消息透露，在这两个机构中工作的美国“顾问”比其他“美援”官员在家里躲风的时间更长，因为“这些机构同3月15日的欺诈选举有密切的关系”。
    据美联社说，有某些美国人士已经建议由美国对南朝鲜的警察“进行一个大规模的训练计划”。
    南朝鲜傀儡政府正在毫不踌躇地采取法西斯手段镇压南朝鲜人民和反对派。当汉城的汉阳工业高等学校学生近千人7日举行要求驱逐这个学校的反动校长的示威时，傀儡政府调动军队进行镇压。军队几次放射催泪弹，有一个学生受伤。这些军队还用刺刀向示威学生和聚集在学生周围的约二千名群众冲去，逼迫他们散开。
    同一天在汉城，傀儡政府还派遣军队驱散一个目的在于组织一个新的政党的集会。军事戒严当局说，他们的集会是“被禁止的”。戒严当局还把会议的两个发起者带走“讯问”。
