Xinhua News Agency, 18th. Vice Premier Chen Yi solemnly stated in Beijing today that we express our greatest respect for the heroic struggle of the Algerian people, and the Chinese people fully support the Algerian people. He also said that the visit of the Algerian Republic Provisional Government Delegation to China is a support for our China, and we express our gratitude.

Vice Premier Chen Yi made these remarks tonight at a reception held jointly by the Chinese-African People's Friendship Association and the Chinese Committee for Asian-African Solidarity to welcome all the distinguished guests of the Algerian Republic Provisional Government Delegation headed by Vice Premier Krim Belkacem.

Today's reception was a grand gathering demonstrating the friendly unity between the Chinese and Algerian peoples. Among those present at the reception were Vice Premier of the State Council and Chief of General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Luo Ruiqing, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ji Pengfei, President of the Chinese-African People's Friendship Association Liu Changsheng, and Chairman of the Chinese Committee for Asian-African Solidarity Liao Chengzhi, and others.

Vice Premier Chen Yi spoke at the reception. He said that today, African people are fighting against imperialism, Latin American people are fighting against imperialism, Asian people are fighting against imperialism, and the people of Japan, South Korea, and Turkey are fighting against imperialism. He emphasized that in such a huge anti-imperialist wave, the Algerian people have taken up arms to fight, and we express our greatest respect for the heroic struggle of the Algerian people, taking the Algerian people as an example in the struggle against imperialism. We Chinese people fully support you.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that we Chinese people had a painful experience in the eight-year war of resistance against Japanese imperialism, and waged a tenacious and long-term struggle against the Japanese invaders. In the subsequent struggle against Chiang Kai-shek, supported by US imperialism, we also faced great difficulties and waged a very tenacious struggle. Therefore, the Chinese people naturally sympathize with the fighting Algerian people and respect the Algerian people in their arduous struggle.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that we Chinese people will not forget that in the past years of battle, many villages were destroyed by the invading armies of imperialism, many outstanding sons and daughters shed blood and sacrificed themselves in battle, and many revolutionary martyrs were killed in prisons. Our past experiences are roughly the same as the current experiences of the Algerian people.

He said that the Chinese people, with a firm fighting will and flexible strategies and tactics, carried out a long and arduous struggle to create today's environment for peaceful construction. Today, our domestic environment is good, and the international environment is also favorable to us, but the enemy is not relaxing its grip on us. Japan and the United States have signed a military alliance treaty to deal with us, and US imperialism is creating tension in the Taiwan Strait, and some people are opposing us with dishonorable motives. Vice Premier Chen Yi pointed out that the visit of the Algerian Republic Provisional Government Delegation to China at this time is a support for our China, and we express our gratitude.

Finally, Vice Premier Chen Yi proposed a toast to the eternal friendship between the Chinese and Algerian people, to the victory of the Algerian people's struggle, to the health of Prime Minister Abbas, and to the health of all the distinguished guests of the Algerian Republic Provisional Government Delegation headed by Vice Premier Krim Belkacem.

Vice Premier Krim Belkacem spoke amidst warm applause. He said that since we set foot on the land of our friendly country, we have been received with extreme warmth everywhere. I would like to thank the Chinese-African People's Friendship Association and the Chinese Committee for Asian-African Solidarity and the chairmen of these two groups, as well as the respected members, for holding this fraternal meeting for us tonight.

He said that the representatives of fighting Algeria cherish the role played by your committee, and we accepted your invitation with excitement and pleasure. We know that we are only fulfilling our most basic obligations by speaking here, but we have come here mainly to listen to the speeches of our old fighting brothers, and to deeply study and research the rich experience accumulated by the great revolutionary Chinese people in twenty-two years of continuous struggle and war.

He emphasized that, especially five years ago, Arabs, Africans, and Asians gathered together at the historic Bandung Conference to jointly write the birth history of Asian-African people's liberation, and especially clearly pointed out to the Asian-African people that when people are faced with a greedy and irrational enemy, wishes and hopes are not permissible, let alone waiting passively.

Vice Premier Krim Belkacem said that not long ago, the head of the Algerian Republic Government, Ferhat Abbas, said in his speech to the participants of the All-African People's Conference: "The Bandung spirit continues to inspire Asian-African people to attack Western imperialism and their running dogs, thwarting many alliances, shattering many conspiracies, shaking off the shackles of generations of oppression, and opening up an era of rapid and genuine liberation for the majority of mankind.

　　From the edge of Asia to the heart of Africa, this broad liberation movement constitutes a decisive force sufficient to end the Western delusion of exercising hegemony over the entire globe."

He also said that, similarly, we were honored to hear Chairman Mao Zedong say very correctly yesterday evening: "The lifespan of colonialism and imperialism is not long."

He said, therefore, our solidarity is a genuine solidarity. I would like to cite the following facts as proof: the numerous parades and demonstrations held almost everywhere in Asia and Africa to support the people or a country struggling in one form or another for political, social, and economic liberation; the many meetings held by Africans and Asians to discuss issues in a friendly and frank manner in order to seek appropriate solutions through joint efforts.

He said that indeed, there are many days that mark the progress of our common history, including: February 22 – Cameroon Day, March 1 – Day Against Atomic Testing and its Disasters, July 11 – Mongolia Day, March 30 – Algeria Week; for nearly six years, Algeria, standing at the forefront of the African people, has taken up arms to fight against a powerful enemy supplied with arms by the North Atlantic Group, thereby contributing to the arrival of the era of true liberation spoken of by our Prime Minister Ferhat Abbas.

He said that the moving welcome we received in Vietnam and Korea also fully demonstrates the strong solidarity between the African and Asian people.

He said that the great Chinese people and their wise leaders, while selflessly building their country, have spared no effort to bravely support and assist the people who have stood up to completely eradicate all colonialism and its rule. This is also another proof of China's unwavering loyalty to the Bandung spirit.

He said that the Bandung spirit and its principles should become the guidelines for all political activities of all countries and the pointer for every African and every Asian in their struggle for liberation. This is also a lofty principle that we Africans and Asians attending tonight's reception should not violate, otherwise we cannot fulfill our respective responsibilities. Therefore, let us unite and continue to undertake our tasks with active and increasingly effective actions until we achieve the final victory. This is what history requires, and it is also what our dignity as human beings requires.

Finally, Vice Premier Krim Belkacem shouted: Long live the friendship between the Chinese and African people! Long live Asian-African solidarity! Long live the friendship between the Algerian and Chinese people! Long live national independence! Long live world peace! He also proposed a toast to the solidarity of the Asian-African people, to the friendship between the Chinese and Algerian people, to the health of Chairman Mao Zedong, and to the health of Vice Premier Krim Belkacem and the distinguished guests of the delegation and the African friends present.

Liu Changsheng spoke first at the beginning of the reception, paying high tribute to the heroic Algerian people, and expressed that the Chinese people will unswervingly stand with the Algerian people to fight to the end.

Liu Changsheng said that the tenacious and unyielding struggle of the Algerian people for national liberation has dealt a powerful blow to French and US imperialism. Under the call of the Algerian people's battle horn, the oppressed nations of Africa have launched a massive national liberation struggle, and the flames of national independence are burning all over Africa; the colonial system of imperialism in Africa is in the process of disintegration, and the dawn of independence, freedom, and light has already appeared in Africa. Although imperialism is still making desperate struggles and constantly using conspiracies, it cannot save its inevitable demise.

Liu Changsheng said that the national independence movement has become an important force in defending world peace. The heroic spirit and unyielding spirit shown by the Algerian people in the national liberation struggle have not only set a brilliant example for the people of Africa, Asia, and Latin America who are striving for national independence, but also inspired all peace-loving and democratic and freedom-loving people in the world, inspiring the will of the people of all countries in the world to fight against imperialism and colonialism and defend world peace.

Liu Changsheng said that the Chinese people cherish the unity and friendship with the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America very much. He spoke about the development of friendly relations between the Chinese and Algerian people. He said that we will closely join hands on the front line of striving for and maintaining national independence and opposing imperialism, and in the future, our two peoples will continue to support and encourage each other. The Chinese people will unswervingly stand with the Algerian people to fight to the end!

Liao Chengzhi said in his toast, let us express our high respect and firm support to the heroic Algerian people who are standing at the forefront of the anti-imperialist struggle. He proposed a toast to the friendly cooperation between the Chinese people and the Algerian people, to the unity of the Asian and African people, to world peace, and to the health of His Excellency Vice Premier Krim Belkacem and the distinguished guests of the delegation and the African friends present.

African friends who are visiting Beijing were invited to attend the reception.

Also present at the reception were Vice Chairmen of the Chinese Committee for Asian-African Solidarity Mao Dun, Li Dequan, and Bao Erhan, Vice Presidents of the Chinese-African People's Friendship Association Nan Hanchen and Zhang Tiesheng, Minister of Foreign Trade Ye Jizhuang, Deputy Director of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries Chu Tunan, senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, responsible persons of Beijing Municipality, and people from all walks of life in the capital.

    陈毅副总理在中非友协等欢迎阿尔及利亚政府代表团的招待会上说
    中国人民全力支持阿尔及利亚人民
    克里姆·贝勒卡塞姆副总理说，中国不遗余力地支持反殖民主义斗争的人民，是忠于万隆精神的又一证明
    新华社18日讯　陈毅副总理今天在北京庄严地表示，我们对阿尔及利亚人民的英勇斗争表示最大的敬意，中国人民全力支持阿尔及利亚人民。他还说，阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团访问中国，这是对我们中国的支持，我们表示感谢。
    陈毅副总理的这番话是今晚在为欢迎以克里姆·贝勒卡塞姆副总理为首的阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团全体贵宾的招待会上讲的。这个招待会是中国非洲人民友好协会和中国亚非团结委员会联合举行的。
    今天的招待会是一个显示中阿两国人民友好团结的盛会。出席招待会的，有国务院副总理、中国人民解放军总参谋长罗瑞卿，外交部副部长姬鹏飞，中国非洲人民友好协会会长刘长胜，中国亚非团结委员会主席廖承志等。
    陈毅副总理在招待会上讲了话。他说，今天非洲人民正在为反对帝国主义而战斗，拉丁美洲人民正在为反对帝国主义而战斗，亚洲人民正在为反对帝国主义而战斗，日本、南朝鲜和土耳其人民正在为反对帝国主义而战斗。他强调指出：在这样一个巨大的反帝浪潮中，阿尔及利亚人民拿起武器进行战斗，我们对阿尔及利亚人民的英勇斗争表示最大的敬意，把阿尔及利亚人民作为反对帝国主义斗争的榜样。我们中国人民全力支持你们。
    陈毅副总理说，我们中国人民在反对日本帝国主义的八年抗战中，曾经有过巨大的痛苦的遭遇，对日本侵略者进行了顽强的长期的斗争。在以后反对美帝国主义支持下的蒋介石的斗争中，也曾有过巨大的困难，也进行了十分顽强的斗争。因此，中国人民自然地同情战斗的阿尔及利亚人民，尊敬在艰苦战斗中的阿尔及利亚人民。
    陈毅副总理说，我们中国人民不会忘记，在过去的战斗年月里，许多村庄被帝国主义的侵略军队所毁坏，许多优秀的儿女在战斗中流血牺牲，许多革命烈士在牢狱中遭到杀害。我们过去的遭遇同阿尔及利亚人民现在的遭遇大致上是一样的。
    他说，中国人民以坚强的斗争意志，以灵活的战略战术，进行了长期艰巨的斗争，才创造了今天这个和平建设的环境。今天我们的国内环境是好的，国际环境对我们也是有利的，但是敌人并不放松我们，日美签订了军事同盟条约对付我们，美帝国主义在我国台湾海峡制造紧张局势，并且还有些人在用并不光彩的题目反对我们。陈毅副总理指出，这次阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团在这样的时候访问中国，这是对我们中国的支持，我们表示感谢。
    陈毅副总理最后提议，为中阿两国人民的永恒友谊，为阿尔及利亚人民战斗的胜利，为阿巴斯总理的健康，为以克里姆·贝勒卡塞姆副总理为首的阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团的全体贵宾们的健康，干杯。
    克里姆·贝勒卡塞姆副总理在热烈的掌声中讲了话。他说，自从我们踏上了我们友邦的土地以来，我们到处都受到极其热烈的接待。我谨感谢中国非洲人民友好协会和中国亚非团结委员会和这两个团体的主席以及尊敬的委员们在今天晚上为我们举行了这个兄弟般的会见。
    他说，战斗的阿尔及利亚的代表们珍视你们的委员会所起的作用，我们兴奋愉快地接受了你们的邀请。我们知道我们在这儿讲话只是尽了我们最起码的义务，但是我们来到这里主要是听取我们的战斗的老大哥的讲话，深入学习和研究伟大的革命的中国人民在二十二年连续的斗争和战争中积累起来的丰富经验。
    他强调指出，特别是五年以前，阿拉伯人，非洲人和亚洲人在具有历史意义的万隆会议上聚集一堂共同写下了亚非人民解放的诞生史，尤其是向亚非人民明确地指出了当人们面临着一个贪得无厌，而且毫无理性的敌人的时候，祝愿和祈望是不能容许的，更不用说一味等待了。
    克里姆·贝勒卡塞姆副总理说，不久前，阿尔及利亚共和国政府首脑费尔哈特·阿巴斯在向全非人民大会的与会者的谈话中说：“万隆精神继续激励亚非人民冲击西方帝国主义和他们的走狗，挫败了很多联盟，粉碎了很多阴谋，挣脱了世世代代的压迫的锁链，并且正在为人类的大多数开辟着一个迅速取得真正解放的纪元。
　　从亚洲的边缘到非洲的腹地，这个广泛的解放运动构成了一个决定性的力量，足以结束西方妄想在整个地球上行使的霸权。”
    他又说，同样地，我们荣幸地在昨天傍晚听到毛泽东主席十分正确地说：“殖民主义和帝国主义的寿命不长了。”
    他说，因此，我们的团结是一真正的团结。我只想举出下列事实作为证明：在亚非两洲，为了支持为争取政治、社会和经济解放而以这种或那种形式进行着斗争的某一国人民或某一个国家而几乎到处举行的为数众多的游行示威；非洲人和亚洲人为了友好和坦率地商讨问题，以便通过共同努力来寻求适宜的解决方法而举行的许多会议。
    他说，的确，有许多日子标志着我们共同历史的进程，其中有：2月22日——喀麦隆日，3月1日——反对原子试验及其灾害日，7月11日——蒙古日，3月30日——阿尔及利亚周；将近六年以来，站在非洲人民最前列的阿尔及利亚，拿起武器对由北大西洋集团供给军火的强大的敌军进行着斗争，从而对我国总理费尔哈特·阿巴斯所说的真正解放的纪元的到来作出了贡献。
    他说，我们在越南和朝鲜所受到的令人感动的欢迎也充分证明了非洲人民和亚洲人民之间的强有力的团结。
    他说，伟大的中国人民及其英明的领袖在忘我地建设他们国家的同时，不遗余力地和勇敢地支持和援助为彻底铲除一切殖民主义及其统治而站起来了的人民。这也是中国始终不渝地忠于万隆精神的又一证明。
    他说，万隆精神及其原则应当成为各国人民一切政治活动的准则并作为每一个非洲人和每一个亚洲人争取解放的指针，这也是出席今晚酒会的我们非洲人和亚洲人，所不应违背的崇高原则，否则我们就不能尽到我们各自的职责。因此，让我们团结一致，共同以积极的和日益有效的行动来继续担负起我们的任务，直到取得最后的胜利。这是历史所需要的，也是我们作为人的尊严所要求的。
    克里姆·贝勒卡塞姆副总理最后高呼：中国人民和非洲人民之间的友谊万岁！亚非团结万岁！阿尔及利亚人民和中国人民之间的友谊万岁！民族独立万岁！世界和平万岁！他并且提议，为亚非人民的团结，为阿中两国人民之间的友谊，为毛泽东主席的健康，干杯。
    刘长胜在招待会开始时首先讲话，向英雄的阿尔及利亚人民致以崇高的敬意，并且表示，中国人民将始终不渝地同阿尔及利亚人民站在一起斗争到底。
    刘长胜说，阿尔及利亚人民为争取民族解放而进行的顽强不屈的斗争，已经给了法、美帝国主义以有力的打击。在阿尔及利亚人民战斗号角号召之下，非洲被压迫的民族掀起了声势浩大的民族解放斗争，非洲遍地燃烧着民族独立的熊熊烈火；帝国主义在非洲的殖民体系，正处在土崩瓦解的过程中，独立、自由、光明的曙光，已经在非洲出现了。尽管帝国主义还在作绝望的挣扎，不断施展阴谋伎俩，但是挽救不了它必然死亡的命运。
    刘长胜说，民族独立运动已经成为保卫世界和平的重要力量。阿尔及利亚人民在民族解放斗争中所表现的英雄气魄和不屈不挠的精神，不仅为非洲、亚洲、拉丁美洲争取民族独立的各国人民树立了光辉的榜样，而且也鼓舞着全世界一切爱好和平和民主自由的人民，鼓舞着世界各国人民为反对帝国主义反对殖民主义，保卫世界和平的斗争意志。
    刘长胜说，中国人民非常珍视同亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民的团结和友谊。他讲到中国和阿尔及利亚人民之间的友好关系的发展。他说，在争取和维护民族独立、反对帝国主义的战线上紧密地携起手来，今后，我们两国人民也仍将相互支持、相互鼓励。中国人民将始终不渝地同阿尔及利亚人民站在一起斗争到底！
    廖承志在祝酒时说，让我们向站在反帝斗争最前线的英勇的阿尔及利亚人民表示崇高的敬意和坚决的支持。他提议，为中国人民和阿尔及利亚人民之间的友好合作，为亚非人民的团结，为世界和平，为克里姆·贝勒卡塞姆副总理阁下和代表团的贵宾们以及在座的非洲朋友们的健康，干杯。
    正在北京访问的非洲朋友们应邀出席了招待会。
    出席招待会的，还有中国亚非团结委员会副主席茅盾、李德全、包尔汉，中国非洲人民友好协会副会长南汉宸、张铁生，对外贸易部部长叶季壮，对外文化联络委员会副主任楚图南，中国人民解放军高级将领，北京市的负责人，以及首都各方面的人士。
