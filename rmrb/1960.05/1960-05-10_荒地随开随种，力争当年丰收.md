    Reclaim Wasteland and Plant Immediately, Strive for a Bumper Harvest in the Same Year
    In the vast wastelands of Northeast and Northwest China, on the numerous barren mountains of Southwest and Southeast China, and on the many desolate beaches near rivers, lakes, and seas, over the past winter and spring, thanks to the efforts of millions of people's commune members, state farm workers, and cadres at all levels, more than 50 million mu of new cultivated land have been reclaimed. In many places, the newly reclaimed land, averaged by the local population, amounts to one mu, two mu, or even more per person. In Qinghai Province, the total sown area last year was only over 7 million mu, but over the past winter and spring, 6.5 million mu of wasteland were reclaimed. Guangxi reclaimed 10 million mu of virgin wasteland in a few months. Anhui, with relatively little wasteland, also reclaimed over 7 million mu in a few months. Inspired by the great ambition to develop agricultural production at high speed, thousands upon thousands of reclaimers are striving to plant immediately after reclamation and to cultivate and manage well. This is a major change in the wasteland reclamation endeavor.
    In the past, for newly reclaimed land, many people often adopted two cultivation methods: one was to start cultivating a year after reclamation; the other was to sow in a crude manner, plant and then not manage it, and after several years of planting, when the land was exhausted, to abandon it and reclaim elsewhere.
    The former method was to allow the "raw soil" to weather and become "fertile soil" before planting crops, which has a certain rationale; however, the situation where "raw soil" cannot be sown is not absolutely unchangeable. We cannot only see the unfavorable factors of newly reclaimed land and ignore its favorable factors. For example, the fact that the nutrients contained in newly reclaimed land have not yet been utilized is a good condition. The unit yield of the first crops planted on newly reclaimed land is often not as high as that of cultivated land, but since it has been planted, there will always be some harvest. Moreover, as long as we improve the quality of cultivation, strengthen field management, and apply appropriate amounts of fertilizer, the unit yield of newly reclaimed land can also catch up with that of cultivated land. The only question is whether we recognize the urgent necessity of developing agricultural production at high speed, and whether we dare to fully utilize all the favorable conditions of the new era to break the "conventions" of the old era. In the past two years of the Great Leap Forward, examples of achieving a bumper harvest in the same year as wasteland reclamation have become increasingly numerous. Now, we have more experience, better conditions, especially the favorable conditions of launching mass movements, large-scale collaboration, and large-scale operations, and further support for agriculture from all sides. We will certainly be able to strive for a bumper harvest in the same year as reclamation on a large area.
    The latter approach was a "extensive planting and meager harvest" approach adopted under the condition of very low levels of productivity. People were restricted by the production relations and productive forces of the time, and it was impossible to fully exert their subjective initiative, increase the new favorable factors of newly reclaimed land, and strive for a greater harvest in the same year, and even more impossible to make long-term plans to strive for a bumper harvest every year on newly reclaimed land. The current conditions are very different. Relying on the strong strength of the communes and the multifaceted assistance of the state, we can not only fully utilize the favorable factors of newly reclaimed land, but also create many new favorable factors from aspects such as water conservancy development, soil improvement, fertilizer application, and selection of improved varieties. In this way, we can not only plant on the newly reclaimed land, but also achieve a bumper harvest in the same year and a bumper harvest year after year.
    Of course, with a large increase in newly reclaimed land, it is not easy to completely change "only reclaim but not plant" to "plant immediately after reclamation" and to thoroughly change "only plant but not manage" to "plant well and manage well." To achieve this goal, we need to greatly promote revolutionary vigor and the spirit of cooperation, and take the reclamation of wasteland and the striving for a bumper harvest on newly reclaimed land as a national revolutionary cause, and take a series of practical and effective organizational and technical measures. The Qinghai Provincial Party Committee issued a call to action to the people of all ethnic groups in the province to "reclaim one point, plant one point," requiring that all newly reclaimed wasteland be planted well. More than 2.8 million mu have already been planted in the wasteland newly reclaimed in the province during the past winter and spring. Minhe and other counties responded to the call of the Provincial Party Committee, organized various professional teams, and worked on different lines, combining the tasks of wasteland reclamation, land preparation, fertilizer production, and sowing in a流水作业manner, so that wasteland reclamation and sowing were carried out simultaneously. The Qianyang Special District in Hunan Province sowed more than 2.6 million mu of miscellaneous grains on the newly reclaimed large tracts of wasteland and young forest land this year, an increase of 70% over the same period last year. After the communes in Qianyang Special District concentrated their efforts to organize mountain-opening armies to reclaim a large amount of wasteland, they immediately organized forces from all sides to launch a surprise sowing campaign; after sowing, they immediately organized 130,000 laborers to carry out a cultivation and management campaign for miscellaneous grain crops with the focus on full, strong, and uniform seedlings. They adopted methods such as assigning the responsibility of each area to members of the commune Party committee, assigning the responsibility of each team to members of the brigade general branch committee, assigning the responsibility of each group to team cadres, assigning the responsibility of each plot to commune members, and determining leaders, determining labor, determining tasks, determining quality, and determining work points, so that each plot of newly reclaimed land was managed by a dedicated person. At the same time, a competition to turn raw wasteland into fertile soil was launched. The entire district mobilized 40,000 people to form professional teams to camp on the mountains and strengthen the regular management of newly reclaimed land. The soil on newly reclaimed land was not very good, so they applied topdressing fertilizer in stages to improve the soil; mountain areas were prone to natural disasters, so they paid special attention to flood prevention, animal prevention, and pest and disease control. In other areas, many communes have transformed newly reclaimed mountain land into neat terraces, built ring-mountain canals, and accumulated a large amount of fertilizer for newly reclaimed land. In many places, county party secretaries and leading cadres at all levels are growing experimental fields on newly reclaimed land, establishing "command hills." Some communes have also moved many pigs, cattle, and sheep to the mountains to establish livestock farms on the mountains, on the one hand, to save cultivated land at the foot of the mountains, and on the other hand, to increase fertilizer for mountain land. These organizational and technical measures are a strong guarantee for planting in the same year and achieving a bumper harvest on newly reclaimed land. All areas with a large amount of newly reclaimed land can adopt similar measures according to local conditions.
    Tens of millions of mu of newly reclaimed land, which were once barren mountains and wild ridges, barren grasslands, are now beginning to turn into grain mountains, oil mountains, vegetable mountains, wheat fields, cotton fields, sugar crop fields.... This is a new force on this year's agricultural production front. Many areas are still seizing agricultural slack to continue reclaiming wasteland. We should fully utilize all favorable conditions, do our best to overcome all difficulties, plant well for every mu reclaimed, manage well for every mu planted, and strive for newly reclaimed land to catch up with cultivated land, and strive for a bumper harvest in the same year on newly reclaimed land!

### 荒地随开随种，力争当年丰收

    荒地随开随种，力争当年丰收
    在东北、西北的许多荒原上，在西南、东南的许多荒山上，在江河湖海附近的许多荒滩上，去冬今春，经过千百万人民公社社员、国营农场职工和各级机关干部的努力，开垦了五千多万亩新耕地。在不少地方，新开垦的耕地，按当地人口平均，每人有一亩、两亩甚至更多。青海去年全省的播种面积才七百多万亩，去冬今春就开荒六百五十多万亩。广西几个月就开垦生荒地一千万亩。荒地较少的安徽，几个月期间也开荒七百多万亩。千千万万垦荒者在高速度发展农业生产的雄心大志鼓舞下，力求随开随种，并且种好管好。这是开荒事业的一个大变化。
    过去，对于新垦荒地，许多人常常采取两种耕种方法：一种是开垦以后，过一年才开始耕种；一种是采取粗放的方式播种，种上之后并不管理，种上几年，地力用尽了，就撂荒另开。
    前一种作法，为的是使“生土”经过风化变成“熟土”，然后再种植作物，这是有一定道理的；但是，“生土”不能播种的情况并不是绝对不可改变的。不能只看到新垦地的不利因素，忽略了它的有利因素。例如，新垦地含有的肥分还没有被利用过，就是一个好条件。第一次在新垦地上种植农作物，单位产量往往赶不上熟地，可是，既然种上了，总能有一定的收获。何况，只要提高耕作质量，加强田间管理，适当增施肥料，新垦地的单位产量也可以赶上熟地。问题只在于是不是认识到了高速度发展农业生产的迫切必要性，敢不敢充分运用新时代的一切有利条件去打破旧时代的“常规”。在过去的大跃进的两年，当年开荒当年丰收的事例已经越来越多地出现了。现在，我们有了更多的经验，更好的条件，特别是有了大搞群众运动、大协作、大兵团作战的有利条件，有了各方面对农业的进一步支援，一定能够在广大面积上争取当年开荒当年丰收。
    后一种做法，是在生产力发展水平很低的情况下所采取的“广种薄收”的做法。人们受着当时的生产关系和生产力的限制，既不可能充分发挥人的主观能动作用，增加新垦地的新的有利因素，争取当年有更多的收获，更不可能作长远打算，争取新垦地以后年年都能丰收。现在的条件大不相同了。依靠公社的强大力量和国家的多方援助，不但能够充分运用新垦地的有利因素，还能从开发水利、改良土壤、施用肥料、选用良种等方面，创造许多新的有利因素。这样，不仅能把新垦地种上，而且能够当年丰收、连年丰收。
    当然，在新垦地大量增加的情况下，要把“只开不种”完全改变为“随开随种”，把“只种不管”彻底改变为“种好管好”，并不是轻而易举的事情。要达到这个目的，需要大大发扬革命干劲和协作精神，把开垦荒地和争取新垦地上的丰收，作为全民性的一项革命事业，采取一系列切实有效的组织措施和技术措施。青海省委向全省各族人民提出“开一分，种一分”的行动号召，要求把新开荒地全都种好。全省在去冬今春新开垦的荒地中，已经种上了二百八十多万亩。民和等县响应省委的号召，组成了各种专业队，分线作战，把开荒、整地、造肥、播种各项工作，以流水作业的方式结合起来，作到一边开荒，一边播种。湖南黔阳专区今年在新开垦的大片荒地上和幼林地上播种了二百六十多万亩杂粮，比去年同期增加了70％。黔阳专区各公社集中力量组织开山大军开垦了大量荒地之后，立即组织各方面的力量突击播种；播种之后，紧接着又组织十三万劳动力，开展以苗全、苗壮、苗齐为中心的杂粮作物培育管理运动。他们采取了公社党委委员分工包片、大队总支委员分工包队、队干部包组、社员包块和定领导、定劳力、定任务、定质量、定工分等方法，做到每块新垦地都有专人负责管理。同时，开展了生荒赶熟土的竞赛。全区共动员四万人组成专业队上山安营扎寨，对新垦地加强经常管理。新垦地土壤不太好，他们就分期追肥，改良土壤；山地容易遭受自然灾害，他们就特别注意防洪、防兽、防治病虫害。在其他地区，也有许多公社把新垦山地整成了整整齐齐的梯地，修了环山渠道，并且为新垦地积下了大量的肥料。在不少地方，县委书记和各级领导干部都在新垦地上大种试验田，建立“指挥山”。有些公社还把许多猪、牛、羊搬到山上去，在山上建立畜牧场，一方面节约山下的耕地，一方面增加山地的肥料。这些组织措施和技术措施，是新垦地当年播种当年丰收的有力的保证。凡是有大量新垦地的地区，都可以因地制宜采取类似的措施。
    几千万亩新垦地，几个月以前还是荒山野岭、荒原草滩，现在开始变成粮食山、油料山、蔬菜山、麦子地、棉花地、糖料地……。这是今年农业生产战线上的一支新的生力军。许多地区还在抓紧农事空隙，继续开垦荒地。我们应该充分运用一切有利条件，尽力克服一切困难，开一亩就种好一亩，种一亩就管好一亩，力争新垦地赶上熟耕地，力争新垦地当年大丰收！
