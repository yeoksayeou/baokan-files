Children's Poems

The Party's kindness will never be forgotten
	My home's north side was a mass burial ground,
	Now a thermal power plant is built there.
	Before, we groped in the dark,
	Now the night shines brightly.
	Grandpa strokes his beard and smiles,
	"The Party's kindness will never be forgotten."
	(Zhang Riniu, Guangzhou Niao Shi Elementary School)

Young Pioneers cannot be separated from the Party
	Flowers cannot be separated from the soil,
	Fish cannot be separated from the ocean;
	Young Pioneers cannot be separated from the Party,
	The Party is our dear mother.
	(Gao Zhengyi, Guiyang Nanlu Elementary School)

Indigenous blast furnace
	Indigenous blast furnace,
	Emitting red light,
	Brightening every township and commune.
	Iron flows day and night,
	Too much to be contained by even the five lakes and four seas.
	(Jian Ping, Second Middle School of Hongqi Commune, Liuyang, Hunan)

Electric lights like the sun
	Electric lights, electric lights, like the sun,
	Shining brightly all over the mountains and fields,
	Stars peek out from the clouds to compare,
	Like a rooster comparing itself to a phoenix.
	(He Qisheng, Taihe First Middle School, Echeng, Hubei)

Grandpa and the new harbor
	A new harbor was opened at the head of Xingan Village,
	Grandpa came to look at it again and again,
	He stepped on the harbor bank to feel if it was hard or soft,
	And cupped his hands to taste the water to see if it was sweet or fragrant.
	People asked him why he kept coming to look,
	Grandpa said with tears in his eyes:
	"In the past, we burned incense and prayed to the Dragon God during droughts,
	Now the Water Dragon has really come to our village."
	(Liu Jiao, Tianbao Elementary School, Rugao, Jiangsu)

Buying a tractor
	The commune director went to the city,
	And bought a tractor.
	Men, women, old and young all came to see,
	Pushing and shoving.
	(Dong Zhengdong, Shacheng Junior Elementary School, Hebei)

Eliminating the four pests
	One mosquito flies in front,
	Ten children chase behind,
	With a slap,
	The mosquito kicked the bucket.
	(Zhou Xiaogang, First Central Elementary School, Xicheng District, Beijing)

Green Brigade
	Crossing mountains and ridges, the green brigade came,
	Not afraid of steep cliffs,
	Not afraid of hard stones.
	Hoes and picks fly together,
	Sweat pours like rain,
	For the trees in the mountains,
	They volunteer to plant on holidays.
	The whole people are in the Great Leap Forward,
	The mountain peaks are green,
	Want to ask who the soldiers are?
	The Young Pioneers!
	(Hu Yuxing, Dushi Road Elementary School, Guiyang)

Golden Mountain
	Golden grain, piled like mountains,
	Covering half the blue sky.
	My brother and I climb the mountain,
	Climb, climb, wow!
	It will take several days to climb to the top!
	(Yu Kebin, Huaihai Road Elementary School, Shanghai)

My hometown has changed
	My home is in Xiaonanwa,
	The mountain village is too remote.
	Since the establishment of the commune,
	Electric lights and telephones have been installed.
	The team has a radio,
	So we can listen to speeches sitting on the kang.
	Yesterday I passed Heilong Village,
	And discovered a railway runs to my home.
	(Fu Yu, Kangping, Liaoning)

    孩子的诗
    党的恩情永不忘我家北面乱葬岗，建起火力发电厂。从前黑夜摸着走，如今黑夜放光芒。爷爷摸着胡子笑，“党的恩情永不忘。”（广州鸟石小学张日牛）
  少先队员离不开党花儿离不开土壤，鱼儿离不开海洋；少先队员离不开党，党就是我们的亲娘。
  （贵阳市南路小学高正一）
    土高炉土高炉，放红光，乡乡社社明亮亮。昼夜不停流铁水，五湖四海也难装。（湖南浏阳红旗公社二中剑平）
    电灯像太阳电灯电灯像太阳，漫山遍野放光芒，星星钻出云来比，好比公鸡比凤凰。
  （湖北鄂城太和一中贺其胜）
    爷爷和新港村头新开了一条大港，爷爷三番五次跑来张望，他用脚踩踩港岸是硬是软，又用手捧起水尝尝是甜是香。人们问他为什么老是来张望，爷爷热泪满眶把话儿讲：从前遇上旱年就烧香祭龙，如今水龙真的来到我们村庄。
    （江苏如皋天堡小学流浇）
  买来一部拖拉机公社主任去城里，买来一部拖拉机，男女老少争来看，你挤我来我挤你。（河北沙城初小董正东）
      除四害一个蚊子前面飞，十个孩子后面追，拍的一声响，蚊子伸了腿。（北京西城区一中心小学周小刚）
     绿化兵翻山又越岭，来了绿化兵，不怕峭壁陡，不怕石头硬。锄镐齐飞舞，汗水如雨淋，为了山中树，假日来造林。全民大跃进，山峰绿茵茵，要问兵是谁？少年——红领巾。
  （贵阳都市路小学胡玉星）
      黄金山金黄谷，堆成山，遮掉蓝空半边天。我和弟弟爬上山，爬呀，爬呀，吓！爬到山顶要几天！（上海淮海路小学俞克斌）
  家乡变了样我家住在小南洼，山村可太偏僻啦。自从成立公社后，安完电灯安电话。队里有了广播机，坐在炕上听讲话。昨天黑龙村边过，原来是铁路通我家，（辽宁康平傅余）
