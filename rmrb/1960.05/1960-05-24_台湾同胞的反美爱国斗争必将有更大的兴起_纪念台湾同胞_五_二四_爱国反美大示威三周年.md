Three years ago, on May 24th, Taiwan compatriots launched a patriotic anti-American demonstration that shook the world. More than 30,000 enthusiastic Taipei citizens shouted the slogan "American troops get out of Taiwan!" and surrounded the US military headquarters in Taiwan, the US "Embassy" in Taiwan, and the US Information Service. People in other cities in Taiwan responded one after another. That demonstration showed the infinite hatred of Taiwan compatriots for American aggressors. For the past three years, Taiwan compatriots have been relentlessly fighting against American aggression and enslavement, one after another, continuously. There are profound reasons for the deep hatred and strong resistance of Taiwan compatriots to American aggressors.

The purpose of US imperialism in occupying Taiwan is to turn Taiwan into a military base for US imperialism to further invade mainland China and other Asian countries, and through a series of "treaties" and "agreements," to bind the Chiang Kai-shek clique to the US war chariot. Under the drive of the United States, more than 80% of Taiwan's so-called central budget each year is used for direct military expenditure. In order to make up for the financial deficit caused by the huge and ever-increasing military expenditure, the Chiang Kai-shek clique has adopted a policy of heavy tax exploitation and inflation. As early as 1957, Taiwan's tax revenue had already exceeded forty times that of 1949. By the end of 1958, the amount of currency issued had increased more than seventy times compared to June 1949, causing Taiwan's prices to soar eight times during the same period, and the living standards of the broad working people deteriorated sharply. At the same time, due to the aggressive policy of the United States, tens of thousands of young people in Taiwan are conscripted into the army every year to serve as tools of American war. Many Taiwan people are harmed, with wives and children separated, and entire families living in desperation. The American troops invading Taiwan also demarcate "restricted areas" everywhere, building airports, barracks, and bases, seizing large tracts of fertile land, and demolishing tens of thousands of houses of urban and rural residents, making thousands upon thousands of Taiwan compatriots landless, homeless, and displaced. The savage American troops in Taiwan are even more rampant, killing, robbing, raping women, smuggling drugs, and committing all kinds of evil.

In addition, American aggressors also squeeze out Taiwan's industry and agriculture, control the Taiwan market, and plunder huge profits through so-called "economic aid," private investment, and dumping of surplus agricultural and industrial products, making Taiwan's industrial and agricultural production increasingly萎缩, and further deepening the suffering of the Taiwan people. For many years, US imperialism has penetrated into all economic sectors of Taiwan under the guise of "economic aid." According to the Taiwan Kuomintang authorities, by the end of 1958, "US aid" had penetrated more than 230 million US dollars into Taiwan's economy. American capital annexed the Taiwan Shipbuilding Corporation and controlled many industrial enterprises in Taiwan such as electricity, transportation, petroleum, aluminum and fertilizers, turning these enterprises into important means for the United States to extract super-profits and plunder Taiwan's resources. Last year alone, the United States extracted nearly 20 million New Taiwan dollars in interest alone through the Taiwan Power Company, which it controls. In recent years, the total amount of so-called "loans" from the United States to Taiwan's private enterprises has also reached more than 55.6 million US dollars. These "loans" have extremely high interest rates, reaching 18% per annum, which is more than five times the general bank interest rate in the United States. At present, 68 large-scale factories that have accepted "loans" are unable to repay principal and interest under the high-interest exploitation of American aggressors, and are threatened by American annexation and auction of factory buildings and machinery. American monopoly capital directly sets up factories in Taiwan, using the cheap labor of Taiwan compatriots to further control Taiwan's economy, and the sinful activities of攫取超额利润 have also increased in recent years. The United States is also turning Taiwan into a market for transferring its economic crisis and dumping surplus materials. From 1950 to the end of 1958, the United States used "US aid" alone to dump more than 300 million US dollars of surplus agricultural products and more than 200 million US dollars of other materials to Taiwan.

Under the frenzied plunder of American monopoly capital and the flooding of American commodities, Taiwan's industrial and agricultural production has been greatly devastated, and the lives of the broad masses of people are in extremely miserable conditions. Last year alone, more than 30 machinery factories closed down, and the closure of the Western medicine and gauze industries was even more serious, with more than 100 closing down in November and December alone. Taiwan's agricultural production level has stagnated for many years. The withering of industry and the bankruptcy of agriculture have led to an unemployment population of as many as 1.3 million people in Taiwan. In Taipei City alone, more than 6,000 people regularly make a living by selling blood, and the phenomenon of food shortages and starvation among Taiwan farmers is also becoming increasingly serious. According to statistics from the Chiang Kai-shek clique's "Food Bureau," 60% of farm households in Taiwan, about 3.2 million people, do not have enough food and are starving. The tragic events of selling children and daughters, and forcing wives into prostitution are everywhere. Since the beginning of this year, prices in Taiwan have risen madly again, and life for the broad masses of people is becoming increasingly difficult.

Ten years of tragic life have made Taiwan compatriots increasingly aware that the aggression, enslavement, and exploitation of US imperialism are the root cause of all the suffering and disasters of Taiwan compatriots. The more cruelly the American aggressors exploit and enslave the Taiwan compatriots, the deeper the anger of the Taiwan compatriots accumulates, and the stronger their resistance will inevitably become. The "May 24th" patriotic anti-American demonstration proved this truth; the resolute struggle of Taiwan compatriots against American aggressors in the three years since "May 24th" has also proved this truth. More than 1,000 workers of the Taiwan Shipbuilding Corporation, which was annexed by US monopoly capital, have held many strikes and slow-downs due to dissatisfaction with American exploitation and abuse. The establishment of US Phi-Chi Pharmaceutical Factory, Fuller Milk Company, and the recent establishment of Tiansheng Textile Company in Taiwan by US monopoly capital have all been strongly opposed by Taiwan's business community. American aggressors have pressured the Taiwan Power Company to raise prices many times, stimulating rising prices in Taiwan, which has aroused the condemnation of the vast majority of Taiwan compatriots. On February 28th of this year, 30,000 people in Taipei City angrily stormed into the "restricted area" of "Yangming Park" to protest against the unreasonable occupation of the park by the US military in Taiwan. Taiwan compatriots hate the crimes of the rampant and domineering behavior and insults to women by the American aggressor troops to the bone. The hatred of Taiwan compatriots for American aggressors has never been as deep as it is today. They have tempered themselves and further raised their awareness in the struggle against US imperialism.

Now, in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, a storm of struggle against US imperialism is rising everywhere. The volcanoes under the feet of the United States are erupting one after another. As Chairman Mao said: "The life of imperialism will not be long, they have done all kinds of bad things, and all the oppressed people of the world will never spare them." We firmly believe that under the agitation and encouragement of the anti-American wave of the people of the world, and with the support of the people of the whole country, the struggle of Taiwan compatriots against US imperialism and striving to return to the embrace of the motherland will surely have a greater upsurge, and will surely be able to achieve final victory. The Chinese people will surely drive US imperialism back to its old home from Taiwan!

    台湾同胞的反美爱国斗争必将有更大的兴起
     ——纪念台湾同胞“五·二四”爱国反美大示威三周年
    台湾民主自治同盟秘书长　徐萌山
    三年前的5月24日，台湾同胞掀起了震动全世界的爱国反美大示威。三万多热血沸腾的台北市民，高呼“美军滚出台湾去！”的口号，包围了侵台美军司令部，美国驻台湾的“大使馆”和美国新闻处。台湾其他城市的人民也纷纷响应。那次大示威，表现了台湾同胞对于美国侵略者的无限仇恨。三年以来，台湾同胞为着反对美国侵略和奴役，坚持不懈地进行着斗争，此起彼伏，接连不断。台湾同胞对美国侵略者如此切齿痛恨和强烈的反抗，是有着深刻的原因的。
    美帝国主义霸占台湾的目的，就是要把台湾变成美国帝国主义进一步侵略我国大陆和亚洲其他国家的军事基地，并且通过一系列的“条约”和“协定”，把蒋介石集团缚上了美国的战车。在美国驱使下，台湾每年的所谓中央预算，80％以上用于直接的军事开支。蒋介石集团为了弥补由于庞大而又是逐年增长的军费所造成的财政赤字，采取了重税盘剥和通货膨胀的政策。早在1957年，台湾的税收，就已经超过了1949年的四十倍。1958年底通货发行额比1949年6月增加了七十多倍。使台湾的物价在同一期间猛涨了八倍，广大劳动人民的生活急剧地恶化了。同时，由于美国的侵略政策，台湾每年都有好几万青年被强征入伍，充当美国的战争工具。许多台湾人民被害得妻离子散，全家生活陷于绝境。侵台美军还到处划定“禁区”，建筑机场、兵营和基地，强占了大片良田，拆除了数以万计城乡居民的房屋，使得成千上万的台湾同胞无地可耕，无家可归，流离失所。美国的野兽军队在台湾更是横行霸道，杀人抢劫，强奸妇女，走私贩毒，无恶不作。
    此外，美国侵略者还通过所谓“经济援助”、私人投资、倾销剩余农产品和工业品等办法，排挤台湾的工农业，控制台湾市场，掠取暴利，使得台湾的工农业生产日益萎缩，更加加深了台湾人民的痛苦。多年以来，美帝国主义披着“经济援助”的外衣，打进了台湾的各个经济部门。据台湾国民党当局宣布，到1958年底，“美援”对台湾经济的渗透已经达到二亿三千多万美元。美国资本吞并了台湾造船公司，控制了台湾的电力、交通运输、石油、制铝和肥料等许多工业企业，把这些企业变成了美国榨取超额利润，掠夺台湾资源的重要手段。去年一年里，美国通过被它控制的台湾电力公司，仅是利息一项就榨取了将近两万万元新台币。近几年来，美国对台湾民营企业的所谓“贷款”总数也已经达到五千五百六十多万美元。这些“贷款”利息极高，达到年息18％，超过美国国内一般银行利率的五倍。目前，已经接受“贷款”的工厂，在美国侵略者的高利贷盘剥下，已有六十八家规模较大的工厂无法还本付息，受到美国并吞和拍卖厂房、机器的威胁。美国垄断资本直接到台湾设厂，利用台湾同胞的廉价劳动力，进一步控制台湾经济，攫取超额利润的罪恶活动，几年来也有增无已。美国并且把台湾变成它转嫁经济危机，倾销剩余物资的市场。从1950年到1958年底，美国仅利用“美援”，就向台湾倾销了三亿多美元的剩余农产品和二亿多美元其他物资。
    在美国垄断资本的疯狂掠夺和美国商品泛滥的情况下，台湾工农业生产遭到极大的摧残，广大人民的生活陷于极其悲惨的境地。去年一年里机器工厂倒闭的就有三十余家，西药、纱布两个行业的倒闭情况更加严重，仅在去年11、12两个月里就倒闭了一百多家。台湾的农业生产水平，许多年来一直停滞不前。工业雕敝，农业破产，使台湾的失业人口达到一百三十万人之多。台北市一地，经常有六千多人靠卖血为生，台湾农民缺粮挨饿的现象也日益严重。根据蒋介石集团“粮食局”的统计，台湾农村有60％的农户，约三百二十万人粮食不足，陷于饥饿。卖儿卖女，逼妻为娼等人间惨事到处都有。今年年初以来，台湾物价又疯狂上涨，广大人民的日子是越来越难过了。
    十年来的悲惨生活，使台湾同胞日益认识清楚，美帝国主义的侵略和奴役压榨是台湾同胞一切痛苦和灾难的根源。美国侵略者对台湾同胞的压榨和奴役越残酷，台湾同胞的愤怒也就蓄积越深，他们的反抗也就必然会越来越强烈。“五·二四”爱国反美大示威证明了这个真理；“五·二四”以后的三年来，台湾同胞对美国侵略者进行的坚决斗争，也证明了这个真理。被美国垄断资本并吞的台湾造船公司的一千多工人，由于不满美国的压榨和虐待，连续举行了多次怠工和罢工。美国飞筹药厂，福乐奶品公司到台湾设厂以及最近美国垄断资本在台湾设立天生纺织公司，都遭到台湾工商界的强烈反对。美国侵略者压迫台湾电力公司多次加价，刺激了台湾物价上涨，更引起了台湾广大同胞的同声谴责。今年2月28日，台北市又有三万群众为了抗议侵台美军无理霸占“阳明公园”，而愤怒地冲进了公园的“禁区”。台湾同胞对于美国侵略军的横行霸道，侮辱妇女等罪行恨之入骨。台湾同胞对于美国侵略者的仇恨从来没有像今天这样深沉。他们在和美帝国主义的斗争中锻炼了自己，进一步提高了觉悟。
    现在，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲，到处兴起了反对美帝国主义的斗争风暴。美国脚下的火山一个个相继爆发。正如毛主席所说：“帝国主义的寿命不会很长了，他们做尽了坏事，全世界一切受压迫的人民决不会饶恕他们。”我们坚信，在全世界人民反美浪潮的激荡和鼓舞下，在全国人民的支援下，台湾同胞反对美帝国主义，争取回到祖国怀抱的斗争必将有更大的兴起，而且一定能够取得最后胜利。中国人民一定会把美帝国主义从台湾赶回它的老家去！
