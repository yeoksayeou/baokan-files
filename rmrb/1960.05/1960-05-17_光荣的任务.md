    A Glorious Task
    The financial and trade departments and catering industry in Guangzhou's central district, adapting to the developing situation of urban people's communes, have adopted various methods to help the canteens of urban communes train more than 80 accountants and more than 1,000 cooks, making the commune canteens better and better.
    The urban people's commune is a newborn thing. The emergence, development, and growth of new things all require a certain process. Marxists should lead and support new things, so that they can develop rapidly and healthily. The attitude adopted by the financial and trade departments and the catering industry in Guangzhou's central district is precisely this kind of revolutionary attitude.
    Most of the staff in the collective welfare undertakings of the urban people's communes are housewives. After freeing themselves from household chores, their revolutionary enthusiasm is unleashed. However, due to historical conditions, most of them lack the skills of large-scale production. In the past, they were clever housekeepers, but after all, they were only housewives. After becoming social housewives, they are not familiar with large-scale cooking techniques, and they lack experience in running kindergartens and nurseries. This requires enthusiastic help and support from all aspects. Only by helping them quickly master these skills can we promote the continuous consolidation and development of urban people's communes. This is a major event that is beneficial to socialist construction and a glorious task. Yesterday, this newspaper reported the news of many large factories in Beijing helping commune members of urban communes learn production techniques; on May 13, it also reported the news of medical personnel in Foshan helping urban commune kindergartens, nurseries, etc. to establish and improve hygiene systems; today, it reports the vivid examples of the financial and trade departments and catering industry in Guangzhou's central district helping communes train accountants and cooks. These are all examples for us to learn from.

    光荣的任务
    广州中区的财贸部门和饮食行业，适应城市人民公社发展的形势，采取多种办法，帮助城市公社的食堂培训了八十多名会计和一千多名炊事员，使公社食堂越办越好。
    城市人民公社是一个新生的事物。新生事物的产生、发展和壮大，都需要一定的过程。马克思主义者对待新生事物应当领导它，扶持它，使其迅速地、健康地向前发展。广州中区财贸部门和饮食行业所采取的态度，正是这种革命者的态度。
    城市人民公社集体福利事业的工作人员，大部分是家庭妇女。她们摆脱家务琐事以后，革命的热情奔放。但由于历史条件的限制，她们大都缺乏大生产的本领，过去，她们都是管家的巧手，但毕竟只是一个家庭的主妇，成为社会主妇后，对大规模的烹调技术还不熟悉，对办幼儿园、托儿所都缺乏经验。这就需要各方面的热情帮助和支持。帮助她们很快掌握这些本领，才能够促使城市人民公社不断巩固发展。这是有利于社会主义建设的大事，是一件光荣的任务。昨天，本报曾报道了北京许多大工厂帮助城市公社社员学习生产技术的新闻；本月13日，还报道过佛山医务人员帮助城市公社的幼儿园、托儿所等建立和健全卫生制度的新闻；今天，又报道了广州中区财贸部门和饮食行业帮助公社培训会计和炊事员的生动事例。这些，都是我们学习的榜样。
