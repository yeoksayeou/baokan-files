Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, May 6th. The full text of Premier Zhou's speech at the opening ceremony of the Cambodian Royal Radio Station:

    Your Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk, Respected Friends:

    The Song Ren Zhi Radio Station is officially opened today. This is a congratulatory event in Cambodia's establishment of its own broadcasting industry, and it is also the first concrete manifestation of mutual cooperation between our two countries in construction undertakings. I am very honored to be able to personally participate in its opening ceremony. I would like to extend my warm congratulations to His Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk, the Royal Government of Cambodia, the Cambodian workers who participated in this construction project, and all the Cambodian people.

    The Chinese people have long suffered from imperialist aggression and deeply understand the pain of not having their own broadcasting industry. Therefore, we deeply sympathize with the Cambodian people's desire to develop their own broadcasting industry and are happy to be able to make some contributions to it.

    Cambodia is a country that loves peace, freedom, and independence, and its voice should be heard by the whole world. I sincerely hope that this radio station will become a powerful tool for spreading the voices of peace, freedom, and independence.

    I wish the Cambodian broadcasting industry a prosperous future!

    Long live the friendship between China and Cambodia!

    Long live His Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk!

    周总理在柬埔寨皇家电台开幕式上的讲话
    新华社金边6日电　周总理在柬埔寨皇家电台开幕典礼上的讲话全文：尊敬的西哈努克亲王殿下，尊敬的朋友们：
    宋仁枳电台今天正式开幕了。这是柬埔寨建立自己的广播事业中一件值得庆贺的事，同时也是我们两国在建设事业中互相合作的第一个具体表现。我能够亲自参加它的开幕典礼感到十分荣幸。我谨向西哈努克亲王殿下、向柬埔寨王国政府、向参加这项建设工程的柬埔寨职工们和全体柬埔寨人民表示热烈的祝贺。
    中国人民长期遭受帝国主义的侵略，深深体会到没有自己的广播事业的痛苦。因此，我们深切同情柬埔寨人民发展自己的广播事业的愿望，并且以能够对此作出一些贡献而高兴。
    柬埔寨是一个爱好和平、自由和独立的国家，它的声音应该为全世界所听到。我衷心地希望这座广播电台成为传播和平、自由和独立之声的有力工具。
    祝柬埔寨的广播事业日益繁荣！
    中柬友好万岁！
    西哈努克亲王殿下万岁！
