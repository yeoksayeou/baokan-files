Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 17th: Some Indian newspapers continue to smear the Soviet Union regarding the U.S. spy plane incident, going to great lengths to exonerate the U.S. and promoting the idea that this incident should not be taken too seriously.

The "Indian Nation" editorial on the 14th slandered Soviet leader Khrushchev, saying, "We do not know why Khrushchev is attaching so much importance to the plane incident, poisoning the atmosphere of sincere talks." On the other hand, this newspaper shamelessly whitewashed Eisenhower's forced admission of espionage flights over the Soviet Union, praising him for "expressing his reaction in a straightforward manner."

The "Tribune" published an editorial on the 14th absurdly claiming that the U.S. intrusion into Soviet airspace "has no significance or importance from the perspective of maintaining peace and eliminating fear and suspicion." It defended U.S. aggression, saying, "As long as countries continue to suffer from fear and suspicion, the recurrence of such things is inevitable."

The "Amrita Bazar Patrika" published an editorial on the 15th, slandering Khrushchev's just condemnation of the U.S. intrusion into Soviet airspace as a "severe threat" and said that it "greatly intensified the atmosphere." This newspaper supported the U.S., saying, "Undoubtedly, Eisenhower came forward to honestly admit it—although this was a humiliating thing for the U.S.—purely to salvage the summit conference."

The "Times of India" commented on the 16th, slandering the Soviet Union's participation in the summit conference as having "ulterior motives" and "hoping to gain huge benefits from the summit conference," thus claiming that there was no need to worry that the U.S. admission of spy flights would undermine the summit conference. "Thought Weekly" on the 14th, in order to defend the U.S. aggression, even spread a preposterous lie, accusing the Soviet Union of announcing to the world that the spy equipment was found in the downed U.S. plane as "a combination of fact and fiction," saying that Khrushchev revealed it to use the incident to achieve "various goals." This weekly complied with the U.S.'s robber logic, saying, "The history of international espionage is even longer than the history of international diplomacy. It is an activity that every country engages in without any qualms."

The Jana Sangh's organ, "The Organiser," complained on the 16th that the U.S.'s "series of admissions" about sending planes to intrude into the Soviet Union had given "Khrushchev's propaganda an excellent opportunity." This weekly maliciously fabricated rumors and slandered the Soviet Union, saying, "Since Russia can find cheaper and safer people to do espionage, why would it send planes?"

### 印度右翼报纸为美国开脱罪责  胡说美机侵苏不可避免　反诬苏联造成紧张气氛

    印度右翼报纸为美国开脱罪责
    胡说美机侵苏不可避免　反诬苏联造成紧张气氛
    新华社新德里17日电　印度一些报纸继续就美机侵犯苏联进行间谍活动事件诬蔑苏联，并且极力替美国开脱罪责，宣传说不要过分重视这一事件。
    “印度民族日报”14日的社论诬蔑苏联领导人赫鲁晓夫说，“我们不知道赫鲁晓夫为什么要这么重视飞机事件，毒化诚挚会谈的气氛。”另一方面，这家报纸却无耻地为艾森豪威尔被迫承认对苏联进行间谍飞行的丑态粉饰，称赞他“用直截了当的方式表达自己的反应”。
    “论坛报”在14日发表的一篇社论中竟说美机侵犯苏联领空事件“从维护和平和消除恐惧、怀疑的角度来看是没有什么意义或者重要性的”。它为美国侵略行为辩护说，“只要各国继续为恐惧和怀疑所苦，那么这种事情的再发就是不可避免的。”
    “甘露市场报”15日发表社论诬蔑赫鲁晓夫对美机侵犯苏联领空的正义谴责是“严厉威胁”，并说它“大大使气氛紧张了起来”。这家报纸为美国捧场说，“不容置疑，艾森豪威尔所以出面老实承认——尽管这对美国来说是一件屈辱的事情——完全只是为了挽救最高级会议。”
    “印度时报”在16日的评论中诬蔑苏联参加最高级会议有“暗图”、“希望从最高级会议中得到巨大好处”，因此说什么不必担心美国承认间谍飞行会破坏最高级会议。“思想周刊”14日为了为美国的侵略行为辩护，竟撒下弥天大谎，它居然诬蔑苏联向全世界宣布在被击落的美国飞机中发现了间谍用具“是事实和虚构的结合”，说赫鲁晓夫把它揭露出来是想利用这次事件来达到“各种目的”。这家周刊顺从美国的强盗逻辑说，“国际间谍活动的历史甚至比国际外交活动的历史还长。这是每个国家都放心无愧地从事的一种活动。”
    人民同盟的机关刊物“组织家报”16日埋怨美国对派飞机侵犯苏联一事的“一系列的承认”使“赫鲁晓夫的宣传得到了极好的机会”。这家周报极其恶毒地造谣诬蔑苏联说，“既然俄国能够找到更便宜、更安全的人做间谍，为什么它要派出飞机呢？”
