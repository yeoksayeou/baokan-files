Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 8th - Seoul dispatches: The South Korean people continue to struggle to completely abolish the fascist dark rule of the US-Lee group.

Because US imperialism and its lackeys are still strictly blockading all news from the Busan area, detailed information about the heroic struggle of the Busan people is still unknown. However, according to Tonghwa News Agency, Democratic Party member Lee Jong-nam, a "National Assembly" member who fled from Busan to Seoul, revealed on the 7th that there are struggles in the Busan area every day. He said that the slogans of the Busan demonstrators are not only "Dissolve the National Assembly," but also "Let us end our lives under the eaves of shacks!" Another news agency worriedly said, "It seems that the situation in Busan is critical."

It is reported that the US-Lee group's Busan "Martial Law Command Branch" once asked the executioner Song Yo-chan to send "capable intelligence officers" to Busan. After the pseudo "Minister of National Defense" Lee Jong-chan "consulted" with Heo Jeong, the head of the new puppet group, and the executioner Song Yo-chan, he rushed to Busan on the 6th, attempting to use the hackneyed tune of "Communist infiltration" as an excuse to massively arrest and bloodily suppress the Busan people who are persisting in heroic struggle.

According to the "Dong-A Ilbo" newspaper, 800 students from Dongqiu Women's Commercial High School in Seoul held a strike to oppose the corrupt school authorities and the school authorities' use of the school for reactionary political activities.

According to Dongyang News Agency, fishermen in the Busan area are also fighting to expel the US-Lee group's henchmen in the so-called "Korean Fishermen's Association" and various fishery organizations. These henchmen have always relied on the US-Lee group to exploit the fishermen. The news agency also revealed that the despicable henchmen of the fishery organizations had extorted hundreds of millions of hwan from the fishermen under the pretext of collecting "election funds."

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 8th - According to the Korean Central News Agency: The "Council for the Promotion of Peaceful Reunification," composed of South Korean political activists in North Korea, held a plenary meeting in Pyongyang today to support the patriotic and just struggle of the South Korean people, support the statement on the current situation in South Korea passed by the joint conference of political parties and social organizations in Korea, and called on South Korean politicians to actively implement this statement.

After Park Yeol, Standing Committee member of the Council and former chairman of the "Korean Residents Group in Japan," conveyed the joint statement of Korean political parties and social organizations, Kim Hyo-seok, former South Korean "Minister of Home Affairs," and Cho Heon-yeong, Kim Chil-seong, Kwon Tae-hee, former South Korean "National Assembly members," and Park Bo-ryeom, former Vice-Chairman of the South Korean Women's Nationalist Party, spoke at the meeting. They unanimously supported the South Korean people's struggle against the tyranny of the US-Lee group, demanding a new life, a new system, and new politics. They condemned Heo Jeong and his ilk for inheriting Lee Seung-man's fascist mantle and acting as US imperialist lackeys, betraying the country and the nation. They called on South Korean politicians of conscience not to be lackeys of US imperialism.

They unanimously pointed out that only by standing on the side of the people, and struggling to withdraw US troops from South Korea and completely abolish the fascist terrorist rule apparatus of the Lee Seung-man group, is the path of the nation and one's own path.

The speakers at the meeting also pointed out that the statement of Korean political parties and social organizations on the current situation in South Korea fully reflects the aspirations and urgent wishes of all Koreans, and it points out the proper way to deal with the current situation in South Korea. Therefore, all South Korean politicians and all conscientious people should strive for the implementation of this statement.

    在朝鲜北部的南朝鲜政治活动家支持南部同胞的斗争
    新华社平壤8日电　汉城消息：南朝鲜人民为全面废除美李集团法西斯黑暗统治继续斗争。
    因为美帝国主义及其走狗仍然严密封锁釜山地区一切消息，釜山人民坚持英勇斗争的详细情况人们至今还不知道。但是，据同和通讯社报道，从釜山跑到汉城的伪“国会”民主党议员李钟南7日透露，釜山地区天天都有斗争。他说，釜山示威群众的口号不仅是“解散国会”，还有“让我们结束窝棚屋檐下的生活！”等。另一家通讯社担心地说，“看来釜山局势是危急的”。
    据报道，美李集团的釜山“戒严司令部分部”曾经要求刽子手宋尧赞派“能干的情报官员”到釜山去。伪“国防部长官”李钟赞同新傀儡集团的头目许政、侩子手宋尧赞“会商”之后，已在6日那天匆匆忙忙地赶到釜山，企图借口“共产党渗入”的滥调，大肆逮捕和血腥镇压坚持英勇斗争的釜山人民。
    据“东亚日报”报道，汉城东丘女子商业高等学校的八百名学生曾经举行罢课，反对贪污腐化的学校当局，反对学校当局利用学校来进行反动的政治活动。
    据东洋通讯社报道，釜山地区的渔民也在为驱逐美李集团御用的所谓“大韩渔民会”和各个渔业机构的御用分子而进行斗争。这些御用分子以往一直依仗美李集团来剥削渔民。这家通讯社还透露，卑鄙的渔业机构的御用分子曾经在征收“选举资金”的借口下，向渔民勒索了数亿圜。
    新华社平壤8日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社消息：由在朝鲜北部的南朝鲜政治活动家组成的“促进和平统一协议会”今天在平壤举行全体会议，声援南朝鲜人民的爱国正义斗争，支持朝鲜各政党、社会团体联席会议通过的关于南朝鲜目前局势的声明，并且号召南朝鲜的政界人士积极实现这一声明。
    协议会常务委员、“留日韩国人居留民团”前团长朴烈在会上传达了朝鲜各政党、社会团体联合声明以后，前南朝鲜“内务部长官”金孝锡、前南朝鲜“国会议员”赵宪泳、金七星、权泰羲、前南朝鲜女子国民党副委员长朴宝濂等在会上发了言。他们一致声援南朝鲜人民反对美李集团的暴政、要求新生活、新制度、新政治的斗争。他们谴责许政之流继承李承晚法西斯衣钵充当美帝国主义的走狗的卖国和背叛民族的行为。他们号召南朝鲜的有良心的政界人士决不要当美帝国主义的走狗。
    他们一致指出，只有站到人民这一边来，为使美国军队撤出南朝鲜和全面废除李承晚集团法西斯恐怖统治机构进行斗争，才是民族的道路，自己的道路。
    在会上发言的人还指出，朝鲜各政党、社会团体关于南朝鲜目前局势的声明完全反映了一切朝鲜人的志向和迫切的愿望，它指出了收拾南朝鲜目前局势的正当途径。因此，南朝鲜所有的政界人士和一切有良心的人士应该为这一声明的实现而努力。
