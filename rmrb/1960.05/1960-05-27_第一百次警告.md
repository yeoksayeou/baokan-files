    The Hundredth Warning
    On May 25, American warships intruded into the sea area of Dongyin, Fujian Province, China. The spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs was instructed to issue another serious warning. This is the hundredth warning to the United States government. Since September 7, 1958, in the hundred serious warnings issued by the Chinese government regarding the crimes of the United States in侵犯 Chinese territorial waters and airspace, a total of 181 American warships of various types have intruded into Chinese territorial waters 88 times, and 242 American aircraft of various types have intruded into Chinese airspace 68 times, totaling 156 times. These American acts of aggression, recorded one by one, can never be washed away, even with the water of the Pacific Ocean, and will stink for ten thousand years.
    The armed forces of the United States have actually run more than 10,000 kilometers away from their own country, repeatedly, again and again, ...and to the point of 156 intrusions into China's territorial waters and airspace sovereignty, carrying out military provocations and war threats. Is there a more arrogant precedent in the history of international relations? Doesn't this fact alone sufficiently demonstrate that the United States is the most aggressive imperialist country?
    The apologists for American imperialism have said that the twelve nautical mile width of territorial waters declared by the Chinese government is "unacceptable" to the United States. According to this "reason," American warships "don't count" as intruding into Chinese territorial waters. This is a complete pirate's logic. Because: First, defining the scope of territorial waters is the sovereignty of each country. China is not the only country that has declared a twelve-nautical-mile territorial sea; there are also more than a dozen countries such as the Soviet Union, Indonesia, and the United Arab Republic. The United States has no reason not to recognize the territorial sovereignty of these countries, nor any reason to invade their territorial waters. Second, the scope of territorial waters stipulated by various countries in the world today varies, some are three nautical miles, some are six nautical miles, some are twelve nautical miles, and some are even more. According to the American "logic," then, can countries that advocate three nautical miles invade countries that advocate six nautical miles, and can countries that advocate six nautical miles invade countries that advocate twelve nautical miles? If all countries were like the United States, wouldn't the world be in chaos? Third, the United States has invaded China's territorial waters more than once, and the Chinese government has issued warnings more than once. Why does the United States repeatedly violate the warnings despite dozens of them? This can only be explained by the fact that the United States is deliberately engaging in aggression. Fourth, China and the United States are separated by the largest ocean on earth – the Pacific Ocean. It is truly a vast ocean, and there is no room for the "navigation" of American warships there? Why does the United States insist on sending them to the coast of China and continuously intruding into China's territorial waters? Is this because China declared twelve nautical miles as the width of its territorial waters? Of course not. The United States' refusal to recognize China's twelve-nautical-mile territorial sea absolutely cannot obliterate China's sovereignty, nor can it reduce its crime of aggression in the slightest. It only further exposes the face of the American aggressor in front of the whole world.
    Judging from the records of American intrusions themselves, any excuse that American imperialism attempts to use to cover up its crimes of aggression is completely untenable. In the 156 intrusion incidents, in addition to the 88 incidents of American warships intruding into Chinese territorial waters, there were also 68 incidents of American aircraft intruding into Chinese airspace. American aircraft not only intruded into the airspace above China's territorial waters, but also intruded into the airspace above China's coastal islands, from the Zhoushan Islands in the north to the Xisha Islands in the south; they also intruded not only into the airspace above China's coastal islands, but also into the airspace above China's coastal cities, including Shantou, Lufeng, and other places; they also intruded not only into the airspace above coastal cities, but also into the airspace above the vast inland areas of Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Guangdong, and other provinces, including three times by U-2 reconnaissance aircraft. American aircraft intruding into China were not limited to reconnaissance purposes. At most, there were as many as 28 at a time. Such large-scale intrusions were clearly military provocations and war threats against our country. The U.S. government cannot deny any of these acts of aggression with any sweet talk.
    The United States'侵犯 of China's territorial waters and airspace is only one aspect of its threatening China and creating tension in the Far East and Asia. In addition to this, the United States still occupies China's territory of Taiwan and regards it as an "unsinkable aircraft carrier" of the United States. The United States has also established hundreds of military bases and missile bases around China, in Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, South Vietnam, Thailand, and other countries participating in the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc. In particular, the United States is stepping up the rearmament of Japan and has concluded a military alliance with Japan that targets China, the Soviet Union, Korea, and Southeast Asian countries for aggression. The United States constantly holds large-scale military exercises in the Far East, some of which even openly declare that they are aimed at China. In the past sixteen months, the United States has conducted as many as 38 military exercises in the Far East, including 14 military exercises in the Taiwan area and the Taiwan Strait. In late April, Felt, commander-in-chief of the United States Pacific Armed Forces, openly said: "There is always a danger of all limited wars with Communist Chinese over the Taiwan issue." All this shows that American imperialism has always pursued a policy of aggression and war against China and has been preparing for war in the Far East. And it should be particularly pointed out that since this year, the number of American military provocations against China has increased. The sharp increase in the number of American planes and warships invading China's territorial waters and airspace is a clear sign. In 1959, the average number of incidents of American ships and planes intruding into our territorial waters and airspace was 3.3 times per month. From January to May 1960, the average was 6.2 times per month. This should arouse serious vigilance.
    China and the United States are not at war. China has always been committed to striving for peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, striving to ease international tensions, and preventing the outbreak of a world war. However, whether peaceful coexistence can be achieved does not depend solely on our side, but also on the side of American imperialism. There are no difficulties on our side, the difficulties come from the side of American imperialism. China has not sent a single soldier to occupy American territory, has not sent a single warship to intrude into American territorial waters, has not sent a single aircraft to intrude into American airspace, and has not established a single military base around the United States. China has held ambassadorial talks with the United States since August 1, 1955, first in Geneva and then in Warsaw, lasting four years and nine months, and holding ninety-seven meetings in total. Although the Chinese side has shown great patience in the talks, the American side has consistently refused to reach an agreement on the principle of non-aggression and non-interference in internal affairs to resolve disputes between the two countries without the use of force or the threat of force, insisting on occupying China's territory of Taiwan, insisting on interfering in China's internal affairs, and insisting on carrying out military provocations and war threats against China.
    Faced with American aggression and the threat of force, the Chinese people have fully realized from long-term personal experience that American imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the Chinese people and the most ferocious enemy of the people of the world. American imperialism is engaged in expansion and aggression throughout the world, establishing military bases and stationing troops in more than seventy countries and regions, trampling on the sovereignty of these countries, enslaving the people of these countries and regions, plundering the resources of these countries and regions, and also preparing for a war of aggression against the socialist camp. American imperialism will never give up its ambition to dominate the earth and enslave the people of the world unless it is crushed by the people of the world and suffers a complete defeat. The nature of American imperialism will never change. The aggressive and war policies of American imperialism have not only never changed in the slightest, have not been relaxed in the slightest, but are being carried out more intensely. The ice block of the Cold War created by American imperialism has never melted, as evidenced by its continuous aggressive acts against our territorial waters and airspace, as evidenced by its continuous aggressive acts against Soviet airspace, and as evidenced by its countless crimes of continuously侵犯 the territorial sovereignty of many countries. The Chinese people deeply know that they cannot have any unrealistic illusions about American imperialism. Only through thorough exposure and resolute struggle, and by continuously raising the awareness and vigilance of the people of the world, can we thwart the aggressive and war plans of the United States and safeguard world peace.
    Every invasion of China's territorial waters and airspace by American imperialism is a warning bell for the Chinese people. It reminds the Chinese people: American imperialism is threatening our great motherland. In September 1958, when American imperialism was conducting frequent military provocations and war threats against our country in the Taiwan Strait area, Chairman Mao said: "We need to seriously deal with the fact that the imperialists are bullying us so much." Every provocation and bullying act of American imperialism against our country must be recorded one by one, without any ambiguity. All the crimes of aggression committed by American imperialism against China will eventually be settled. Every invasion of China's territorial waters and airspace by the United States is a debt owed to the Chinese people. Every debt must be repaid. We have already issued warnings in advance. When the debt becomes too high, American imperialism can only blame itself! The Chinese people will never forgive it. As the Chinese saying goes: "Every debt has its debtor." American imperialism can never escape the just judgment and punishment of the Chinese people and the people of the world!

### 第一百次警告

专栏：社论

    第一百次警告
    5月25日，美国军舰侵入我国福建省东引地区海域，我国外交部发言人奉命又提出了严重警告。这是对美国政府的第一百次警告。从1958年9月7日以来，在我国政府对于美国侵犯我国领海领空罪行的一百次严重警告中，计有一百八十一艘各种类型的美国军舰侵入我国领海八十八次，二百四十二架各种类型的美国飞机侵入我国领空六十八次，共一百五十六次。一笔一笔记录在案的美国的这些侵略罪行，纵使倾太平洋之水，也永远洗刷不干净，遗臭万年。
    美国的武装部队竟跑到远离本国一万多公里之外，一而再，再而三，……而至一百五十六次侵犯中国的领海和领空的主权，进行军事挑衅和战争威胁，难道在国际关系史上还有比这更蛮横的先例吗？难道这个事实不就足够说明美国是最富有侵略性的帝国主义国家吗？
    美帝国主义的辩护士们曾经说过，中国政府宣布的十二海里宽度的领海，是美国“不能接受的”。根据这个“理由”，美国的军舰“不算”侵入中国领海。这是彻头彻尾的海盗的逻辑。因为：第一，规定领海范围是每个国家的主权。宣布以十二海里为领海宽度的，不仅仅是中国一国，还有苏联、印度尼西亚、阿联等十几个国家。美国没有任何理由不承认这些国家的领海主权，也没有任何理由侵犯这些国家的领海。第二，现在世界各国规定的领海范围，各有不同，有三海里的，有六海里的，有十二海里的，也还有更多的。根据美国的
  “逻辑”，那末，是不是主张三海里的国家可以去侵犯主张六海里的国家，主张六海里的国家可以侵犯主张十二海里的国家呢？如果各国都像美国这样，岂不是天下大乱？第三，美国侵犯中国领海不止一次，中国政府提出警告也不止一次，为什么美国偏偏不顾几十次警告而屡戒屡犯？这除了表明美国蓄意侵略以外，不能有任何其他别的解释。第四，中国同美国之间横隔着一个地球上最大海洋——太平洋，真是汪洋大海，那里容不下美国军舰的“航行”？为什么美国偏偏要把它们派到中国的沿海，接连不断地侵入中国的领海呢？这难道是因为中国宣布十二海里为领海宽度的结果吗？当然不是。美国不承认中国十二海里的领海宽度，绝对抹煞不了中国的主权，也绝对减轻不了它的侵略罪名，只是在全世界面前更加暴露了美国的侵略者的面目。
    从美国入侵的记录本身来看，美帝国主义企图用来掩盖它的侵略罪行的任何借口，也是完全站不住脚的。在一百五十六次的入侵事件中，除了八十八次美国军舰侵入中国领海事件外，还有六十八次美国飞机侵犯了中国的领空。美国飞机不只是侵入中国领海的上空，而且是侵入了我国沿海岛屿的上空，北至舟山群岛，南至西沙群岛；也不只是侵入了中国沿海岛屿上空，而且侵入了中国沿海城市上空，包括汕头、陆丰等地；也不只是侵入了沿海城市上空，而且侵入了浙江、福建、江西、广东等省的广大内陆地区上空，其中有三次是U—2型侦察机。美国飞机侵入中国，还不仅限于为了侦察的目的，最多的时候，一次达二十八架，这样大规模的侵入，显然是对我国进行军事挑衅和战争威胁。对于所有这些侵略罪行，美国政府的任何花言巧语都是抵赖不了的。
    美国侵犯中国的领海领空，还只是它威胁中国，在远东和亚洲制造紧张局势的一个方面。除此以外，美国迄今仍然霸占中国领土台湾，把那里当作美国的“不沉的航空母舰”。美国还在中国的周围，在日本，在南朝鲜，在菲律宾，在南越，在泰国，以及在别的参加东南亚侵略集团的国家里，建立了成百个的军事基地、导弹基地。特别是美国加紧重新武装日本，同日本缔结了以中国、苏联、朝鲜和东南亚国家为侵略对象的军事同盟。美国在远东地区，不断举行大规模的军事演习，有的演习甚至公然宣布是针对中国的。过去十六个月里，美国在远东举行的军事演习达三十八次之多，其中在台湾地区和台湾海峡的军事演习有十四次。美国太平洋地区武装部队总司令费耳特4月下旬公然说：“始终存在着在台湾问题上同共产党中国人发生一切有限战争的危险”。这一切表明，美帝国主义对中国一直推行着侵略政策和战争政策，在远东一直进行着备战活动。而且特别应当指出的是，今年以来，美国对中国的军事挑衅事件增加了。美国飞机和军舰侵犯中国次数的激增，就是一个明显的标志。1959年，美舰美机侵入我国领海、领空事件，平均每月三点三次，1960年1月到5月平均每月六点二次。这是应当引起严重警惕的。
    中国同美国并没有交战。中国一贯致力于争取不同社会制度的国家和平共处，争取国际紧张局势缓和，制止世界大战爆发。但是能否实现和平共处，并不仅仅决定于我们这方面，还取决于美帝国主义方面。在我们方面是没有什么困难的，困难来自美帝国主义方面。中国没有派遣过一兵一卒占领美国领土，没有派遣过一艘军舰侵入美国领海，没有派遣过一架飞机侵入美国领空，也没有在美国周围建立一个军事基地。中国从1955年8月1日起，就同美国举行大使级的会谈，先在日内瓦，后在华沙，历时四年又九个月，前后开了九十七次会，尽管中国方面在会谈中表现了极大的耐心，但是美国方面始终拒绝在互不侵犯、互不干涉内政的原则下达成不以武力或者武力威胁解决两国争端的协议，坚持霸占中国领土台湾，坚持干涉中国内政，坚持对中国进行军事挑衅和战争威胁。
    面对着美国的侵略和武力威胁，中国人民从长期的切身的经验中充分认识到，美帝国主义是中国人民的最凶恶的敌人，也是全世界人民的最凶恶的敌人。美帝国主义在全世界进行扩张和侵略，在七十多个国家和地区建立军事基地和驻扎军队，蹂躏这些国家的主权，奴役这些国家和地区的人民，掠夺这些国家和地区的资源，同时也准备着对社会主义阵营的侵略战争。不到黄河心不死，美帝国主义如果不遭到全世界人民的粉碎性的打击，如果不遭到彻底的失败，它是绝不会放弃它的称霸地球、奴役全世界人民的野心的。美帝国主义的本质是绝不会改变的。美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，不但从来没有丝毫的改变，没有丝毫的放松，而且是变本加厉地进行着。美帝国主义制造的冷战冰块从来没有融解过，这从它不断侵犯我国领海领空的罪恶行为得到证明，从它不断侵犯苏联领空的罪恶行为得到证明，从它不断侵犯许多国家的领土主权的无数罪行得到证明。中国人民深知，对于美帝国主义不能抱有任何不切实际的幻想，只有彻底的揭露和坚决的斗争，不断提高世界人民的觉悟和警惕，才能挫败美国的侵略计划和战争计划，才能维护世界和平。
    美帝国主义对中国领海、领空的每一次侵犯，对于中国人民来说都是一下警钟。它提醒中国人民：美帝国主义在威胁着我们伟大的祖国。在1958年9月间，正当美帝国主义在台湾海峡地区对我国进行频繁的军事挑衅和战争威胁的时候，毛主席就说过：“帝国主义者如此欺负我们，这是需要认真对付的。”美帝国主义对我国的每一次挑衅，每一次欺负，都必须一次不漏地、一笔一笔地记下来，丝毫不能含糊。美帝国主义对中国所犯下的一切侵略罪行，有朝一日终要清算的。美国对中国领海、领空的每一次侵犯，都是欠下中国人民的一笔债。每一笔债都是必须偿还的。我们已有警告在先，当债台高筑的时候，美帝国主义只能怪它自己了！中国人民是绝不会饶恕它的。中国俗话说得好：“冤有头，债有主”。美帝国主义绝不能逃脱中国人民和全世界人民的正义的审判和惩罚！
