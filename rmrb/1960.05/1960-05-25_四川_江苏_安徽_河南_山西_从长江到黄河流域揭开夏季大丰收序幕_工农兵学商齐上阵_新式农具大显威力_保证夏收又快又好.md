From the Yangtze River to the Yellow River Basin, a large-scale high tide of winter wheat harvesting is rapidly developing from south to north. The winter wheat in Yunnan, Sichuan, Jiangxi, Hunan, and other provinces will soon be harvested; in some areas of the Huai River Basin and the Yellow River Basin, winter wheat entered the yellow ripening stage in mid-May and can be harvested at the end of May; in most areas of the Yellow River Basin, winter wheat is currently flowering and filling, and will ripen in early June. Judging from the growth of winter wheat in various regions this year, the busy harvest season in the main winter wheat producing areas will be around "Grain in Ear" (芒种), which will be similar to previous years, except for a slight advance in a few arid areas.

To ensure high yields and bumper harvests, most wheat-producing areas have focused on tool reform ahead of time this year. The Taigu harvester in Shanxi has been basically finalized after repeated improvements and will be further promoted this year. This harvester is pulled by one animal and can harvest about 25 mu per day. It is now being rushed to be manufactured in North China, with more than 4,000 units already made in Shandong and more than 3,700 units made in Henan. Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces have selected 17 sets of summer harvest tools suitable for use in the mountainous areas of Southwest China. The harvesting efficiency of these tools is generally 12 to 16 times higher than manual labor. In addition, various localities have also created and promoted some new harvesting and threshing tools according to local conditions.

    (Reported by this newspaper) Sichuan is taking various measures in the summer harvest to ensure careful harvesting and threshing, striving for every grain to be stored in barns and a complete harvest of the bumper crop.

    This year, Sichuan has achieved a bumper harvest of over 50 million mu of spring crops. To fight the final battle and get all the fruits of the bumper harvest, all localities have further improved labor organization while strengthening education on cherishing grain. Many communes have formed specialized teams for harvesting, threshing, winnowing, transporting, and warehousing. The combination of specialized teams and mass efforts ensures that as each plot ripens, it is harvested.

    Various localities have also vigorously promoted improved agricultural tools and improved harvesting techniques, which not only improved efficiency but also improved the quality of harvesting and threshing. Many areas have changed from using barrel threshing to stone roller threshing.

    (Reported by this newspaper) Golden waves are rolling, and silver sickles are flying as the summer harvest begins on both sides of the Yangtze River in Jiangsu. Teams from all walks of life supporting the summer harvest are dispatched together, and the complete sets of summer harvest tools are showing great power. This is a new scene in Jiangsu's summer harvest this year.

    This year, the area of summer-ripening crops in Jiangsu has expanded by more than 30% compared with last year, and the crops are growing well, so the labor required for the summer harvest will be greater than in any previous year. To ensure high yields and bumper harvests, and to ensure careful harvesting and threshing, many areas are now collaborating in the summer harvest between workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and businessmen. Nantong City has mobilized all possible forces to support the summer harvest in rural areas, and more than 20,000 cadres, workers, and students from the city have gone to the suburbs to support the summer harvest. In Xuzhou Prefecture alone, more than 400,000 office cadres, soldiers, teachers, students and urban residents have recently gone to the fields to harvest wheat.

    The province has also invested more tools in the summer harvest than last year, and many of them are complete sets of new tools. This year, the region has newly produced more than 20 million pieces of medium-sized and small agricultural tools for summer harvesting and planting, an increase of two times compared with the same period last year, thus enabling this year's summer harvest progress in the province to exceed any previous year.

    (Reported by this newspaper) The prelude to the great summer harvest has been unveiled in Anhui Province. The vast number of commune members in the province have been harvesting with joy in recent days.

    Due to the universal adoption of the one-stop flow operation method of "harvesting, threshing, drying, and warehousing at the same time," the harvesting progress in Anhui has been greatly accelerated this year. At present, more than 2 million mu of rapeseed and more than 900,000 mu of barley have been harvested in the province, and the "March Yellow" wheat has also been harvested one after another. According to the harvesting situation, although the summer harvest crops in the province suffered from cold waves in the previous period, the output is still not low due to the strengthening of late management.

    The area of summer harvest crops in Anhui Province this year has expanded by more than 10 million mu compared with last year, of which large areas of high-yield fields account for 40%. The area of summer harvest crops is large, grows well, and is concentrated in contiguous plots. Based on these characteristics, all localities have carefully arranged the work of harvesting, transporting, threshing, and managing to ensure high yields and bumper harvests. Langxi County, Wuhu Prefecture, adopted the method of threshing in the fields, near the barns, and in centralized threshing grounds to improve harvesting efficiency. The county has built more than 3,000 threshing grounds, an average of one ground for every 200 mu of summer harvest crops. This centralized threshing allows for wind drying and cleaning on the spot, weighing and warehousing nearby, which increases harvesting efficiency by more than 30% and greatly reduces transportation labor.

    (Reported by this newspaper) Henan Province, one of the main wheat-producing areas in China, has 80 million mu of wheat, and everywhere is a golden scene. Whether in the mountains, plains, newly reclaimed Yellow River beaches, or historically low-lying waterlogged areas, the wheat waves are rolling everywhere, presenting a scene of bumper harvest.

    The 35 million mu of high-yield wheat plots in the province are even more delightful; the plots are connected to each other, the wheat plants are strong, the ears are large and the grains are full, like a shining yellow silk covering the earth. Yanshi County, the famous Henan Province wheat high-yield red flag county, has expanded its high-yield wheat plots from 10,000 mu last year to 300,000 mu this year, and every mu is expected to achieve high-yield production. Here, there is an 800-mu high-yield field cultivated by Liu Yingxiang, a wheat expert from a peasant background. The wheat plants are chest-high, each ear is three or four inches long, and each ear has fifty or sixty grains, all of which are full. According to the latest estimation, the commune members believe that at least 1,000 jin per mu can be harvested, and at least 800 jin. Now the people of the province are welcoming the unprecedented great wheat harvest with excitement.

    (Reported by this newspaper) Winter wheat in Shanxi is gradually maturing from south to north. Farmers in the southern counties of Ruicheng, Pinglu, Yuncheng, and Linyi began the prelude to this year's great wheat harvest ahead of schedule starting on the 18th.

    This year's winter wheat in Shanxi Province is generally growing with thick stems, lush leaves, tall plants, large ears, and plump grains, presenting a scene of great harvest everywhere. To ensure that the wheat is harvested plot by plot as it ripens, and that no grain is lost, and that a bumper harvest is achieved, the people's communes in various wheat-producing areas prepared sufficient harvesting and transportation tools as early as possible, organized specialized wheat harvesting teams, and immediately launched a rush harvest as soon as the wheat turned yellow. The counties in Jinnan Prefecture, a major wheat-producing area, in order to ensure that all 9.46 million mu of winter wheat in the area are harvested cleanly in seven days, the fields are clear in ten days, and threshing and warehousing are completed in half a month, extracted more than 1.2 million commune members, office cadres, students, workers, and health medical personnel to form a specialized assault team to rush harvest wheat. As the wheat gradually ripens, they have rushed to the fields with tools to engage in rush harvesting. In recent days, Ruicheng County has dispatched 100,000 commune members every day, and by the 21st, 25,000 mu of wheat have been rushed harvested.

    四川  江苏  安徽  河南  山西
    从长江到黄河流域揭开夏季大丰收序幕
    工农兵学商齐上阵　新式农具大显威力　保证夏收又快又好
    大规模的收获冬小麦高潮正在由南而北地迅速发展。云南、四川、江西、湖南等省的冬小麦很快就要收完；淮河流域和黄河流域的部分地区的冬小麦5月中旬进入黄熟期，5月底可以开镰；黄河流域大部地区的冬小麦目前已经扬花灌浆，到6月上旬黄熟。从今年各地冬小麦生长情况来看，主要冬小麦产区的收割大忙将在“芒种”前后，除少数干旱地区略有提早外，其他地区和往年相仿。
    为了保证丰产丰收，多数麦产区今年都提前狠抓工具改革。山西太谷号收割机经多次改进，已基本定型，今年将进一步推广。这种收割机由一畜牵引，一天能收二十五亩左右。现在华北各地正在大力赶制，山东已制成四千多部，河南制成三千七百多部。四川、云南、贵州三省评选出十七种适合西南山区使用的成套的夏收工具，这些工具收割工效比手工一般提高十二到十六倍。此外，各地还因地制宜地创造和推广了一些新的收割和脱粒工具。
    本报讯　四川各地在夏收中采取各种措施，精收细打，力争颗粒归仓，丰产全收。
    今年，四川五千多万亩小春作物大丰收。为打好最后一仗，将丰产果实全部拿到手，各地在加强爱粮教育的同时，都进一步做好了劳力组织工作。许多公社都组成收割、脱粒、风晒、运输、入库等专业队。专业队和群众突击相结合，熟一块，收一块。
    各地还大力推广改良农具，并改进收割技术，既提高了工效，又提高了收打质量。许多地区都将拌桶脱粒改为石磙脱粒。
    本报讯　金浪翻腾，银镰飞舞，江苏长江两岸的夏季大丰收开始了。各行各业支援夏收的队伍一齐出动，成龙配套的夏收利器大显威力，这是今年江苏夏收的新景象。
    江苏今年夏熟作物的面积比去年扩大30％多，长势又好，夏收用工将比以往任何一年更多。为了保证丰产丰收，精收细打，目前许多地区都是工农兵学商协作收麦。南通市动员一切可以动员的力量，支援农村夏收，全市到郊区支援夏收的干部、职工、学生等有两万多人。徐州专区仅是最近已下田收麦的机关干部、部队官兵、学校师生、城市居民就有四十多万人。
    这个省投入夏收的工具也比去年多，有许多是配套成龙的新工具。全区今年新制的夏收夏种的中小型农具有两千多万件，比去年同期增加了二倍，从而使今年全省的夏收进度超过了以往任何一年。
    本报讯　夏收作物大丰收的序幕已在安徽省揭开。全省广大社员连日来正以喜悦的心情开镰收割。
    由于普遍采取“边收、边打、边晒、边入库”的一条龙流水作业方法，今年，安徽各地的收割进度大大加快。目前，全省已收割油菜二百多万亩，大麦九十多万亩，三月黄小麦也已经陆续开镰。根据收打情况看来，全省夏收作物前一时期虽遭寒潮侵袭，但因加强了后期管理，产量仍然不低。
    安徽省今年夏收作物比去年扩大一千多万亩，其中大面积丰产田占40％。夏收作物面积大，长得好，集中连片。根据这些特点，各地都细致地安排了收、运、打、管工作，保证丰产丰收。芜湖专区郎溪县采取就田、就仓、集中打场的办法，提高收割工效，全县共做好打谷场三千多个，平均每二百亩夏收作物一个场。这样集中打场，就场风晒扬净，就近过秤入仓，使收割工效提高30％以上，并且大大减少了运输劳力。
    本报讯　我国主要麦产区之一的河南省，全省八千万亩小麦，到处一片金黄。不论山区、平原、新开垦的黄河滩和历年来低洼涝地，到处麦浪滚滚，呈现一片丰收景象。
    全省三千五百万亩小麦丰产方，更是令人喜爱；方方相连，麦株茁壮，穗大粒饱，像一匹闪闪发光的黄绫，复盖着大地。有名的河南省小麦丰产红旗县——偃师县，小麦丰产方由去年的一万亩扩大到今年的三十万亩，亩亩都要达到高额丰产。这里有农民出身的小麦专家刘应祥培植的一块八百亩高额丰产田，麦棵齐胸，每个穗子都有三、四寸长，每穗五、六十粒籽，粒粒饱满。根据最近一次估产，社员们认为起码每亩收一千斤，最少也不会低于八百斤。现在全省人民都怀着激动的心情，迎接空前未有的小麦大丰收。
    本报讯　山西冬小麦，由南而北渐渐成熟，南部地区的芮城、平陆、运城、临猗等县的农民，从18日起提前揭开了今年小麦大丰收的序幕。
    山西省今年的冬小麦，普遍长的秆粗叶茂，株高穗大，籽粒饱满，到处呈现着一片大丰收的景象。各产麦区的人民公社为了做到黄一块割一块，颗粒不丢，丰产丰收，都及早动手准备了充足的收割、运输等麦收工具，组织起麦收专业队伍，等小麦一黄熟，立即展开了抢收活动。盛产小麦的晋南专区各县，为了保证全区九百四十六万亩冬小麦七天地净，十天场光，半月脱粒归仓，抽出了一百二十多万名公社社员、机关干部、学生、工人、卫生医务人员组成一支抢收小麦专业突击队，随着小麦的渐渐黄熟，纷纷携带工具奔赴田间投入了抢收。连日来，芮城县每天出动十万名社员，到21日已经抢收小麦两万五千亩。
