Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 11th: Health and medical personnel in Foshan City, Guangdong Province, are adapting to the needs of the rapidly developing urban people's communes, and are vigorously helping collective welfare undertakings such as urban public canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens to do a good job in sanitation.

The number of public canteens in Foshan City has rapidly developed to 526, and the number of people eating in the canteens accounts for more than 91% of the city's population. With the assistance of health and medical personnel, more than 2,600 cooks in the city's public canteens have undergone physical examinations. All cooks are studying politics and food hygiene at the "Cook Red and Expert Schools" run by the street offices.

Preschool teachers and caregivers in Foshan City have generally undergone short-term childcare and healthcare training. Each nursery or kindergarten has one or two health workers. Children entering nurseries are given various vaccinations and injections according to the season. Most nurseries and kindergartens also have "health rooms" or "disease isolation rooms." Caregivers conduct "morning checks" for children every morning and pay close attention to children's food hygiene.

The sanitation work of collective welfare undertakings in Foshan City is being done well mainly because the municipal party committee attaches great importance to this work. After the new situation of large-scale collective welfare undertakings in the city emerged, the CPC Foshan Municipal Committee instructed party organizations at all levels and medical and health institutions throughout the city to make the sanitation work of canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens an important task in running urban people's communes well. All four street offices in the city have now opened "Cook Red and Expert Schools," with the party secretary personally teaching political classes and medical and health personnel teaching hygiene classes.

    办好城市公社的一项重要任务
    佛山大抓集体福利事业卫生工作
    据新华社广州11日电　广东省佛山市卫生医务人员，适应城市人民公社迅速发展的需要，大力帮助城市公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园等集体福利事业搞好卫生工作。
    佛山市的公共食堂已经迅速发展到五百二十六个，在食堂吃饭的人数占全市人口的91％多。在卫生医务人员的协助下，全市公共食堂的二千六百多名炊事员都进行了体格检查。所有炊事员都在街道办事处开办的“炊事员红专学校”学习政治和饮食卫生等知识。
    佛山市保教人员普遍经过短期保育、保健训练。每个托儿所或幼儿园都有一个或两个保健员。对入托的儿童按照季节给他们进行各种预防接种和注射。大多数托儿所、幼儿园还设置有“卫生室”或“疾病隔离室”，每天早上保育人员都为儿童进行“晨检”，对儿童的饮食卫生也十分注意。
    佛山市集体福利事业的卫生工作作得好，主要是市委对这项工作十分重视。全市大办集体福利事业的新形势出现后，中共佛山市委就指示各级党组织和全市医疗卫生机构，把做好食堂和托儿所、幼儿园的卫生工作，作为办好城市人民公社的一项重要任务。全市四个街道办事处现在都分别开办了“炊事员红专学校”，由党委书记亲自担任政治课，医疗卫生人员担任卫生课。
