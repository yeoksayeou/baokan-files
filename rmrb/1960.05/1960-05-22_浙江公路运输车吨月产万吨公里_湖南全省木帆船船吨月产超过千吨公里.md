Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou Dispatch: Zhejiang Province's highway transport system employees are vigorously engaged in competitions, striving to improve transportation efficiency. In April, the average vehicle ton-month production (the amount of transportation per ton of carrying capacity per month) reached over 10,100 ton-kilometers, nearly double that of the same period last year. Among them, the Hangzhou District Highway Transportation Bureau achieved a vehicle ton-month production of over 15,500 ton-kilometers, and nine transportation sections, including Lanxi and Ningbo, all achieved vehicle ton-month production of over 10,000 ton-kilometers.

In the "10,000 Ton-Kilometer" competition movement, the transportation workers of the province were highly motivated, striving for the top, and new records emerged constantly. After the Lishui Transportation Section pioneered a new record of a single vehicle towing four trailers carrying 38 tons of goods, highway transport workers throughout the province immediately launched a competition upsurge of "Learn from Lishui, Catch up with Lishui, Surpass Lishui." The driver of truck No. 1537 of the Hangzhou Transportation Section modified the parts and successfully towed ten trailers carrying a total of 117 tons of goods. The driver of truck No. 1511 of the Ningbo Section learned from the advanced experience of the Hangzhou Section and created a record of towing fourteen trailers carrying a total of 127 tons of goods. The driver of truck No. 1537 of the Hangzhou Section continued his efforts and created a new record of towing 131 tons of goods.

In order to achieve the goal of 10,000 ton-kilometers of vehicle ton-month production, Zhejiang highway transportation departments further strengthened labor organization and comprehensively launched day and night double-shift transportation. The Ningbo Transportation Section organized personnel who knew how to drive cars and divided them into day and night double-shift transportation, achieving "stopping people but not the vehicles, one vehicle doing the work of two," prompting the entire section's vehicles to create a record of over 16,000 ton-kilometers of vehicle ton-month production. In April, more than 63% of the province's vehicles were operating on double shifts.

Within the highway transportation departments, employees of vehicle teams, maintenance, road maintenance, and loading and unloading units all cooperated and worked together to ensure the realization of the "10,000 Ton-Kilometer" competition targets. Maintenance workers vigorously repaired old parts and prepared more spare parts to improve the vehicle integrity rate. Road maintenance workers also went on the road day and night to maintain the roads, creating conditions for accelerating the speed of cars.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha Dispatch: Hunan Province's 150,000 wooden sailboat water transport workers are fighting with high spirits and cleverly seizing high production. In April, the province's average ship ton-month production reached 1,318 ton-kilometers, achieving the goal of "Hunan Province becoming a province with 1,000 ton-kilometers of wooden sailboat ship ton-month production" ahead of schedule.

On the basis of the excellent results achieved in transportation in the first quarter, the wooden sailboat transportation workers of this province adhered to high efficiency and high speed, and in April launched a massive competition movement throughout the province to "Learn from Huarong, Catch up with Huarong, and be the same as Huarong." On the basis of consolidating and improving the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization of port loading, unloading, and handling, they vigorously promoted a series of advanced experiences and methods such as two boats helping each other, light and heavy cargo matching, boats towing rafts, rafts loading cargo, and one boat acting as multiple boats, so that transportation efficiency continued to improve. In April, the province's wooden sailboats completed a transport volume of 7.87 million tons and a turnover volume of 487.73 million ton-kilometers, both of which greatly exceeded the monthly plan and increased by two and a half times and more than four times respectively compared with the same period last year. Due to the improvement of transportation efficiency, a large amount of previously awaiting-transportation materials has now been transported.

In the competition movement of 1,000 ton-kilometers of wooden sailboat ship ton-month production, many regions in the province have created excellent results. In April, the Changde Special District's ship ton-month production reached 3,492 ton-kilometers; the Huarong County's ship ton-month production reached more than 7,900 ton-kilometers. The province also saw the emergence of a 10,000-ton-kilometer cooperative and two 8,000-ton-kilometer cooperatives. The Yang Changgen boat team of the Miluo Brigade in Xiangyin County adopted the method of helping each other to tow rafts and load cargo with two boats (a total of nine tons). On the 47-kilometer route from Yangsimiao to Leishi, they loaded 798 tons of cargo in one voyage, creating a high-yield record of "one boat acting as 88 boats," with a ship ton-day production of up to 4,412 ton-kilometers.

At present, the province's wooden sailboat workers are carrying out a major summary, major inspection, major evaluation, major promotion, and major improvement, fighting hard in May and June to ensure a full harvest in the entire quarter.

    浙江公路运输车吨月产破万吨公里
    湖南全省木帆船船吨月产超过千吨公里   
    新华社杭州电　浙江省公路运输系统职工大搞竞赛，努力提高运输效率，4月份平均车吨月产（每一个载重吨位一个月的运输量）达到一万零一百多吨公里，比去年同期提高近一倍。其中，杭州区公路运输局车吨月产达到一万五千五百多吨公里，兰溪、宁波等九个运输段，车吨月产都在万吨公里以上。
    这个省的运输职工在“万吨公里”竞赛运动中，干劲冲天，力争上游，新创造新纪录不断涌现。丽水运输段首创一车四挂拖运三十八吨货物的新纪录后，全省各地公路运输职工立即掀起了“学丽水、赶丽水、超丽水”的竞赛热潮。杭州运输段一五三七号货车驾驶员改装了机件，拖带十辆挂车共一百一十七吨货物成功。宁波段一五一一号货车驾驶员学习了杭州段的先进经验，创造了拖挂十四辆挂车共一百二十七吨货物的纪录。杭州段一五三七号货车驾驶员再接再厉，又创造了拖载一百三十一吨货物的新纪录。
    为了实现车吨月产万吨公里的目标，浙江公路运输部门进一步加强了劳动组织，全面开展了日夜双班运输。宁波运输段把会开汽车的人员组织起来，分成日夜双班运输，做到“停人不停车，一车顶两车”，促使全段车辆创造了车吨月产一万六千多吨公里的纪录。全省4月份开双班运输的车辆占全部车辆的63％以上。
    公路运输部门内部，车队、保修、养路、装卸等单位职工，也都协同一致，扭成一股绳，保证“万吨公里”竞赛指标的实现。保修工人大搞修复旧件和多制备品，提高车辆完好率。养路工人也日夜上路，把公路养护好，为加快汽车行驶速度创造了条件。
    新华社长沙电　湖南省十五万木帆船水运职工斗志昂扬，巧夺高产，4月份全省船吨月产平均达到一千三百一十八吨公里，提前实现了“木帆船船吨月产千吨省”的目标。
    这个省的木帆船运输职工在第一季度运输取得优异成绩的基础上，坚持高效率、高速度，4月份又在全省掀起了一个声势浩大的“学华容，赶华容，和华容一个样”的竞赛运动。他们在巩固和提高港口装卸搬运机械化、半机械化程度的基础上，大力推行两船相帮、轻重配载、船拖簰、簰装货、一船当多船等一系列先进经验和办法，使运输效率不断提高。4月份，全省木帆船完成运输量七百八十七万吨，周转量四亿八千七百七十三万吨公里，都大大超过了当月计划，比去年同期分别增长了二倍半和四倍多。由于运输效率的提高，大量过去待运的物资，现在已经运了出来。
    在木帆船船吨月产千吨公里的竞赛运动中，全省有不少地区创造了优异的成绩。常德专区4月份船吨月产已经达到三千四百九十二吨公里；华容县船吨月产已经达到七千九百多吨公里。全省还涌现出一个万吨公里社和两个八千吨公里社。湘阴县汨罗大队杨长根船组两只船（共九吨）采取相帮拖簰装货的办法，从杨泗庙至磊石共四十七公里的航线中，一个航次就装运七百九十八吨货，创造了“一船当八十八只船”的高产纪录，船吨日产量高达四千四百一十二吨公里。
    目前，全省木帆船职工正在大总结、大检查、大评比、大推广、大提高，大战5、6月，保证全季满堂红。
