Xinhua News Agency, May 13th: The All-China Women's Federation of the People's Republic of China today sent a telegram to the National Council Against Revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" in Japan, stating that for more than a year, the Japanese people and Japanese women have continuously launched more than ten large-scale struggles, wave after wave, forcing the Kishi Nobusuke government to postpone its attempt to forcibly pass the treaty in the House of Representatives, powerfully striking at the conspiracy of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries colluding to plot a new war, and making significant contributions to safeguarding the safety of the Japanese people and defending Asian and world peace.

The All-China Women's Federation expressed its heartfelt respect once again in the telegram to the Japanese people and Japanese women who are bravely and resolutely carrying out the unprecedented Sixteenth National Unified Action. The telegram said: "The signing of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty has more nakedly exposed the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism and the Kishi Nobusuke reactionary clique and their sinister conspiracy to plot a new war. The Japanese people and Japanese women, who have seen through their sinister conspiracy, will absolutely not allow this conspiracy of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries to succeed."

The telegram from the All-China Women's Federation pointed out that U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the people of the world. It is facing increasingly resolute opposition from the people of the world who uphold justice and love peace, and its days are becoming increasingly difficult. The telegram said: "In Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the struggle against imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism, is also unfolding vigorously. The will of the people is irresistible, and the fate of the people of all countries is not in the hands of imperialism and its lackeys, but in the hands of the people of all countries themselves. If U.S. imperialism dares to launch a war of aggression, it will surely be utterly destroyed."

The telegram said: "The anti-U.S. patriotic and just struggle of the Japanese people has the support of the people of the world. The Chinese people always stand on the side of the Japanese people, and in the struggle against our common enemies—U.S. imperialism and Japanese militarism—we have formed a close fighting friendship with the Japanese people. In order to oppose the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and support the Japanese people's anti-U.S. patriotic and just struggle, since May 9th, 5.7 million people in seventeen cities including the capital Beijing in our country have held grand mass rallies and demonstrations. Chinese women are greatly excited and encouraged by the staunch and unyielding struggle of the Japanese people and women. We firmly believe that the heroic Japanese people, with the support of the broad masses of the people of the world, will surely be able to shatter the U.S.-Japan military alliance, and the Japanese people's struggle for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality will surely achieve final victory."

Xinhua News Agency, May 13th: The Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs today sent a telegram to the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations and the "National Council Against Revision of the Security Treaty," supporting the anti-U.S. patriotic and just struggle of the Japanese people.

The telegram said, "The Japanese people's national unified action against the ratification of the new U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty has achieved significant victories time and again. This struggle has seriously struck at the conspiracy of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries to force the Japanese Diet to pass the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty' as soon as possible. Currently, the Japanese people have launched a magnificent and powerful Sixteenth National Unified Action. We extend our warmest congratulations to the victory of the Japanese people's anti-U.S. patriotic and just struggle and pay our highest respects to the heroic Japanese people.

"U.S. imperialism today is not only intensifying its military collusion with the Kishi Nobusuke reactionary clique in Japan, pursuing a policy of aggressive war in the Far East, but also establishing military bases in many countries around the world, acting as the world's police, and suppressing the struggle of people of all countries for freedom, democracy, and national liberation.

"However, the era of imperialism running rampant in the world is gone forever. Now the East Wind has further prevailed over the West Wind, the strength of the socialist camp, the strength of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against imperialism and colonialism, and the strength of peace-loving people all over the world have overwhelmed the war forces of imperialism, and imperialism and its puppet regimes in various countries are rotting day by day. At present, not only in Japan, but also in South Korea and Turkey, large-scale patriotic and just struggles against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys have been launched, which fully shows that wherever there is reactionary rule supported by the United States, there is a raging fire of people's struggle. The anti-U.S. patriotic and just struggle of the Japanese people, which has risen wave after wave in the past year, has powerfully supported the struggle of the people of Africa, Latin America, and the people of the world. We firmly believe that the heroic Japanese people, who are rich in struggle experience, as long as they strengthen unity, make persistent efforts, and persist in the struggle, will surely be able to completely defeat the conspiracy of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries to ratify the new U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty' and achieve final victory. Because the people are the decisive factor, relying on the unity and struggle of the people will surely defeat imperialism and their running dogs."

The telegram concluded by saying, "The 650 million Chinese people and all peace-loving people in the world firmly support you. We wish the historically significant Sixteenth National Unified Action greater victory. Let the people of China and Japan unite and overthrow our common enemy, U.S. imperialism."

    中国人民始终站在日本人民一边
    全国妇联、中国人民外交学会打电报支持日本人民的正义斗争
    新华社13日讯　中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会今天打电报给日本阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议说，一年多来日本人民和日本妇女再接再厉一浪高过一浪地连续十多次掀起了声势浩大的斗争，迫使岸信介政府推迟了企图在众议院强行通过这一条约的时间，有力地打击了美日反动派狼狈为奸策划新战争的阴谋，对保障日本人民的安全、保卫亚洲和世界和平作出了重大贡献。
    全国妇联在电报中对正在英勇顽强地展开规模空前的第十六次全国统一行动的日本人民和日本妇女再一次表示衷心的敬意。电报说：“日美军事同盟条约的签订，更加赤裸裸地暴露了美帝国主义和岸信介反动集团的侵略本性和它们策划新战争的罪恶阴谋。看穿了它们的罪恶阴谋的日本人民和日本妇女，是绝对不会让美日反动派的这一阴谋得逞的。”
    全国妇联的电报指出，美帝国主义是世界人民的公敌。它正在遭到全世界主张正义爱好和平的人民的越来越坚决的反对，它的日子已经越来越不好过。电报说：“在亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲反对帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义的斗争也在如火如荼地展开。人民的意志是不可抗拒的，掌握各国人民命运的不是帝国主义及其走卒，而是各国人民自己。美帝国主义如果胆敢发动侵略战争，遭到彻底毁灭的一定是它自己。”
    电报中说：“日本人民的反美爱国正义斗争有着全世界人民的支持。中国人民始终站在日本人民的一边，并且在反对我们共同的敌人——美帝国主义和日本军国主义的斗争中，已经和日本人民结成了紧密的战斗友谊。为了反对日美军事同盟条约，支援日本人民这一反美爱国正义斗争，从5月9日起，我国已有首都北京等十七个城市的五百七十万人民分别举行了盛大的群众性集会和示威。中国妇女为日本人民和妇女坚强不息的斗争感到极大的兴奋和鼓舞。我们坚决相信，英勇的日本人民，在全世界广大人民的支持下，一定能够粉碎日美军事同盟，日本人民争取独立、民主、和平、中立的斗争一定能够获得最后的胜利。”
    新华社13日讯　中国人民外交学会今天致电日本恢复日中邦交国民会议和“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”，支持日本人民的反美爱国正义斗争。
    电报说，“日本人民反对批准新的日美军事同盟条约的全国统一行动，一次又一次地取得了重大胜利。这一斗争严重地打击了美日反动派企图强使日本国会早日通过日美‘安全条约’的阴谋。目前，日本人民又掀起了波澜壮阔、气势磅礴的第十六次全国统一行动。我们谨以最大的热情为日本人民的反美爱国正义斗争的胜利而欢呼，并向英勇的日本人民致以崇高的敬意。
    “美帝国主义今天不仅在日本同岸信介反动集团加紧进行军事勾结，在远东推行侵略战争政策，而且在世界很多国家建立军事基地，以世界宪兵自居，镇压各国人民争取自由、民主、民族解放的斗争。
    “但是，帝国主义在世界横行霸道的时代已经一去不复返了。现在东风已经进一步压倒西风，社会主义阵营的力量，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲反对帝国主义和殖民主义的力量，以及全世界爱好和平人民的力量，已经压倒了帝国主义的战争势力，帝国主义及其在各国的傀儡政权正一天天烂下去。目前，不仅在日本，而且在南朝鲜和土耳其也都掀起了大规模的反对美帝国主义及其走狗的爱国正义斗争，这充分表明哪里有美国支持的反动统治，哪里就有人民斗争的怒火。一年来一浪高过一浪的日本人民反对美日反动派的爱国正义斗争，有力地支持了非洲、拉丁美洲人民以及全世界人民的斗争。我们坚信，富有斗争经验的英勇的日本人民，只要加强团结、再接再厉、坚持斗争下去，一定能够彻底挫败美日反动派批准新日美‘安全条约’的阴谋并取得最后的胜利。因为人民是决定的因素，依靠人民的团结和斗争必能战胜帝国主义和他们的走狗。”
    电报最后说，“中国六亿五千万人民和世界一切爱好和平的人民都坚决支持你们。祝具有历史意义的第十六次全国统一行动取得更大的胜利。让中日两国人民团结起来，打倒共同敌人美帝国主义。”
