Evidence of the US-Japan Reactionaries' Conspiracy to Invade the Soviet Union and China

Japanese Socialist Party Diet members reveal: American U-2 reconnaissance planes use Japan as a base to intrude into the territories of China and the Soviet Union to take military intelligence photos. The photos and maps published here are ironclad evidence of the US-Japan reactionaries' aggression.

The photo in the upper left corner is of the US Army Far East Map Bureau located in Jujo, Kita-ku, Tokyo. It is directly under the US Department of Defense and specializes in drawing maps for operations against China, the Soviet Union, and Vietnam. Approximately one thousand skilled Japanese cartographers, some formerly associated with the Japanese Army, work in the bureau.

The picture on the right is the Japan "Self-Defense Forces" aeronautical chart that Socialist Party member Asukata took out at the special committee on the "Security Treaty" in the Japanese House of Representatives on April 14. The lower left picture is another aeronautical chart that Socialist Party member Okada Haruo took out at the special committee on the "Security Treaty" in the House of Representatives. These two aeronautical charts were drawn by the Japanese "Defense Agency" based on maps provided by the US military. In the map in the lower left corner, you can see the flight range includes the Siberian region and Primorsky Krai of the Soviet Union, as well as the coastal area of our country (the Chinese place names on the map were added by the Japanese "Akahata" newspaper when it published the map). The map on the right is part of Guangdong Province in our country. The "Remarks" column below the map reads: "The place names on the aeronautical chart provided by the US military have been changed to Chinese characters."

Although the Air Staff Office of the Japanese "Defense Agency" tried its best to quibble in response to the questioning by Socialist Party members, it finally had to admit that the Japanese authorities have been drawing aeronautical charts of the Chinese and Soviet regions for a long time, and last year alone they drew 120 aeronautical charts including part of the Soviet Far East Primorsky Krai and the coastal area of our country. He also admitted that these aeronautical charts were made based on maps provided by the US military, plus Japanese data. (Attached pictures)

    美日反动派阴谋侵略苏联和中国的罪证
    日本社会党议员揭露：美国Ｕ—2型侦察机以日本为基地，侵入中国和苏联的领土，拍摄军事情报照片。这里发表的照片和地图就是美日反动派的侵略罪行的铁证。
    左上角的照片，是设在东京北区十条的美国陆军远东地图局。它直属美国国防部，专门负责绘制对中、苏和越南作战的地图。有一千名左右的熟练的与前日本陆军有关的日本制图人员在该局内工作。
    右图是4月14日社会党议员飞鸟田在日本众议院“安全条约”特别委员会上拿出来的日本“自卫队”航空图。左下图是社会党议员冈田春夫在众议院“安全条约”特别委员会上拿出来的另一幅航空图。这两幅航空图都是日本“防卫厅”根据美军提供的地图而绘制成的。在左下角的地图内，可以看到飞行范围包括苏联的西伯利亚地区和滨海省，以及我国沿海一带（图上的汉字我国地名系日本“赤旗报”刊登该图时所加）。右面的地图是我国广东省的一部分。图下的“备考”栏内写着：“由美军提供的航空图将地名改为汉字。”
    日本“防卫厅”航空幕僚监部在答复社会党议员的质询时虽然百般狡辩，但是却终于不得不承认日本当局长期以来就在绘制有中、苏地区的航空图，仅在去年一年就绘制了一百二十幅包括苏联远东滨海省一部和我国沿海地区在内的航空图。他还承认了这些航空图是以美军提供的地图为蓝本，加上日本方面的资料制作的。（附图片）
