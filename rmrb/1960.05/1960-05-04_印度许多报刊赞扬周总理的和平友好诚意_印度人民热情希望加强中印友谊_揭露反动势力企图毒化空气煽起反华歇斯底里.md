Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 3rd: Many Indian newspapers have praised Premier Zhou Enlai's friendly attitude displayed in India and his sincerity in peacefully resolving the Sino-Indian border dispute. They also exposed that some reactionaries in India and their newspapers are obstructing the settlement of the border dispute between China and India, and are attempting to continue using this dispute to achieve their ulterior motives.

An article in the May 1st issue of the "Delhi Times" weekly praised Premier Zhou's visit, believing that the visit left a very good impression on the Indian people. It said: "Those who attempt to poison the atmosphere and create hatred are already in an extremely embarrassing and uneasy situation."

The weekly's editorial on the same day said: "The Indian people are very satisfied to note that the Chinese delegation, especially their Premier, adopted a conciliatory attitude throughout the talks. Premier Zhou Enlai never departed from his consistent position of eternal friendship, and he gave this friendship from the Chinese side to India. There is no doubt that his profound insight into the everlasting friendship between the two countries has deeply impressed the Indian people."

The editorial said that India should unite on the common goals with China, which is that both need to alleviate the poverty of the people and ensure a peaceful living environment in order to carry out constructive efforts and promote their cultures. In this way, there is no conflict and there can be no conflict. The editorial said that peace, understanding, and friendship should be sought as much as possible, and talks should continue until complete success is achieved.

"India News Service" commented on the Sino-Indian Joint Communiqué on April 26, saying that Premier Zhou Enlai's visit "is an important step in breaking the border dispute." The commentary welcomed the decision of China and India to hold talks at the official level, and believed that the agreement between the two sides that both sides would do everything possible to avoid border friction and conflict during the official meetings was a positive development in the Sino-Indian Prime Ministers' talks. The commentary believed that Premier Zhou Enlai "put forward effective arguments" at the Delhi press conference, and praised the moderate attitude taken in the speech.

The editorial of "Free Press" on April 28 said that the Sino-Indian Prime Ministers' talks increased the understanding of each other's views. The editorial exposed the Indian reactionaries' attempt to spread frustration, create provocative actions, and create new obstacles. The editorial called on the Indian people to continue to be vigilant and take a positive attitude so that the reactionaries would fail.

The "People's Power" published an editorial on the 26th, pointing out that the monopoly capitalists' newspapers added ulterior motives to the joint communiqué, saying that it admitted that it was impossible to maintain friendly relations between India and China. This was only "a manifestation of the subjective ideas of the press tycoons who shamelessly dance to the tune of their foreign masters." The editorial pointed out that India's "monopoly capital newspapers and the forces supporting it do not want to resolve the Sino-Indian border dispute at all. On the contrary, these forces are using this dispute to incite anti-China hysteria among the people in order to serve their own purposes. They hope to use the tension in Sino-Indian relations to drag India into the anti-communist camp." The editorial said: "We should pay special attention to the remarks made by Premier Zhou Enlai when he set off for Kathmandu. Zhou Enlai said in his unique simple and warm manner that the clouds temporarily floating between China and India will be dispelled, and the friendship between the Chinese and Indian people will eventually shine brightly. Peace-loving people welcome Premier Zhou's statement. The peace-loving millions in India warmly and strongly resonate with this view. No matter what obstacles imperialism and their local agents create, the Sino-Indian border dispute will be resolved amicably through negotiations."

Some Indian newspapers pointed out the different attitudes of both sides when reporting and commenting on the Sino-Indian Prime Ministers' talks. A reporter from "The Hindu" pointed out that "the Chinese delegation came to India, their actions were very appropriate, normal, and even pleasant." "They talked about their reasons with firm conviction." "Zhou Enlai came here to explore whether it is possible to reach a comprehensive solution with India." "He would rather solve the entire border issue on the basis of mutual concessions, but India is not prepared to do so." When talking about Nehru's attitude, the newspaper pointed out that at the beginning of the talks, Nehru's position was still "unshakeable" and that he "did not expect the talks to produce any amazing results." The newspaper pointed out that there is a faction in India "who do not hate keeping an undecided border for several years." They believe that this "will help strengthen domestic unity," "may put the communists in the country in a passive position," and make "India's connection with Western democracies will gradually and inevitably tend to become closer."

    印度许多报刊赞扬周总理的和平友好诚意
    印度人民热情希望加强中印友谊
    揭露反动势力企图毒化空气煽起反华歇斯底里
    新华社新德里3日电　印度的许多报刊赞扬周恩来总理在印度所表现出的友好态度和和平解决中印边界争端的诚意，并且揭露印度国内的一些反动派和它们的报刊阻挠中印两国解决边境争端，并且妄图继续利用这种争端来达到它们的不可告人的目的。
    5月1日的“德里时代”周报的一篇报道赞扬周总理的访问，认为这次访问给印度人民留下的印象是非常好的。它说：“企图毒化空气和制造仇恨的人已经陷于极端狼狈和不安的境地。”
    这家周报同一天发表的社论说：“印度人民非常满意地注意到，中国代表团，特别是他们的总理，在整个会谈期间都采取了和好的态度。周恩来总理从来没有离开他一贯的永恒友谊的立场，他把中国方面的这种友谊给予了印度。毫无疑问，他所主张两国永远友好的真知灼见，已经使印度人民得到很深刻的印象。”
    社论说，印度应当在同中国的共同目标方面一致起来，它们都需要解除人民的贫困，保障和平的生活环境，以便进行建设性的努力和发扬它们的文化。这样，就没有也不可能发生冲突。社论说，应当尽可能地寻找和平、谅解和友谊，继续举行会谈，直到完全成功为止。
    “印度新闻社”4月26日就中印联合公报发表评论说，周恩来总理的访问“是打破边界争端方面的一个重要步骤”。评论欢迎中印双方决定在官员一级进行会谈，并且认为在双方协议在官员会晤期间双方将尽一切可能避免边境摩擦和冲突是中印总理会谈的一个积极发展。评论认为周恩来总理在德里记者招待会上“提出了有效的论点”，并且称赞这次讲话所持的温和态度。
    “自由报”4月28日的社论说，中印总理会谈增进了双方对对方观点的了解。社论揭露印度反动派企图散布沮丧情绪，制造挑衅行动，树立新的障碍。社论要求印度人民继续保持警惕，并且采取积极态度，这样反动派就会失败。
    “人民力量报”在26日发表社论指出垄断资本家的报纸对联合公报加上别有用心的标题，说它承认印度和中国之间不可能保持友好关系，这只是“无耻地跟着外国主子的调子跳舞的报界大亨的主观想法的表现。”社论指出，印度“垄断资本的报纸和支持它的势力都丝毫不想解决中印边界争端。相反地，这些势力利用这个争端在人民中间煽起反华歇斯底里，以便为他们自己的目的服务。他们希望利用中印关系的紧张状况把印度拖入反共的阵营。”社论说：“我们应当特别重视周恩来总理在启程前往加德满都时所发表的谈话。周恩来以他特有的朴素和热情态度说，暂时飘浮在中印两国之间的乌云将被驱散，中印两国人民的友谊终将放出灿烂的光辉。爱好和平的人们欢迎周总理的这种说法。印度的爱好和平的千百万人热情地强烈地同这种看法共鸣。不论帝国主义和它们在当地的代理人，进行任何阻挠，中印边境争端一定会通过谈判得到友好的解决。”
    有一些印度报刊在报道和评论中印总理这次会谈时指出双方不同的态度。“印度教徒报”记者指出，“中国代表团到印度来，他们的行动是很适当的、正常的，甚至是愉快的。”“他们深信不疑地谈到他们的理由。”“周恩来到这里来是为了探测是否有可能同印度取得全面解决”。“他宁愿在互让的基础上解决整个边界问题，但是印度不准备这样做。”这家报纸谈到尼赫鲁的态度时指出，在会谈开始时尼赫鲁的立场仍然是“不可改变的”，他“并没有指望会谈会产生什么惊人的结果”。这家报纸指出，印度有一派人“并不讨厌在若干年内保持一个未决的边界”。他们认为这样“会有助于加强国内团结”，“可能使这个国家内的共产党人处于被动的地位”，使“印度同西方民主国家的联系会逐渐地、然而也是不可避免地倾向于日益密切”。
