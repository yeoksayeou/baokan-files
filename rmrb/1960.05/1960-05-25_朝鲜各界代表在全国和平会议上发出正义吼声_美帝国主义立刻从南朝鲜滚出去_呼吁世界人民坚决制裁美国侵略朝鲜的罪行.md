Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 24th - Newspapers here today reported: As the tenth anniversary of the US imperialism launching the Korean War - "June 25th" - is approaching, the Korean National Peace Conference was held on the 23rd at the Moranbong Theater in Pyongyang. The meeting condemned US imperialism's crimes of aggression and division of Korea, supported the just struggle of the South Korean people, and adopted an appeal to peace-loving people around the world, calling on peace-loving people around the world to resolutely sanction US imperialism's crimes of aggression against Korea.
    Participants in the conference included: Korean Deputy Prime Minister Hong Myung-hee, World Peace Council member and Standing Committee member of the Korean National Committee for the Defense of Peace, Park Jung-ae, members of the Korean National Committee for the Defense of Peace and representatives of the working people, as well as people from the scientific and cultural circles. Han Seol-ya, member of the World Peace Council and Chairman of the Korean National Committee for the Defense of Peace, said in his speech that the history of US imperialism's occupation of South Korea for fifteen years is a record of its crimes as an enemy of peace, launching wars of aggression, dividing Korea, and carrying out colonial plunder. This crime of US imperialism is bound to be solemnly judged by all the Korean people and the people of the world.
    He said that due to the US imperialist policy of aggression and the traitorous actions of its lackeys, South Korea's politics, economy, and all aspects are in a deep crisis, and the South Korean people are rising up in a heroic struggle with blood to fight for freedom and the right to survive. The current situation in South Korea completely exposes the hypocrisy of the American-style "freedom" and "democracy," and reveals its robber face of occupying other countries with cannons, tanks, and knives under the pretext of "anti-communism."
    Han Seol-ya pointed out that US imperialism is the Korean people's irreconcilable national enemy. No matter what tricks it plays, it cannot cover up its aggressive behavior in Korea.
    Han Seol-ya emphasized that the master of Korea is the Korean people, and the fate of Korea should be decided by the Korean people themselves. The US aggressor troops must immediately get out with all the murderous weapons such as atomic weapons and missile weapons that they illegally brought in, and the troops of other countries who entered South Korea as employees of US imperialism must also return to their own countries.
    Han Seol-ya emphasized that the Korean people's patriotic struggle to make US imperialism withdraw from South Korea and peacefully reunify the motherland is directly linked to the struggle of the people of the world against imperialism and for freedom, independence, and peace. With the enthusiastic support and solidarity of the people of the world, the just struggle of the Korean people will surely achieve victory.
    In his speech, Han Seol-ya also severely condemned US imperialism's new crimes of sabotaging the four-power summit and forcibly "passing" the new US-Japan "Security Treaty" with the Kishi Nobusuke group, and expressed active support and solidarity with the just struggle of the Japanese people.
    Subsequently, representatives from all walks of life spoke at the conference. Park Sang-hong, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Vocational General League, spoke on behalf of the workers at the meeting, advocating the rapid convening of a joint conference of political parties and social organizations in North and South Korea to discuss countermeasures to relieve and stabilize the lives of the South Korean people. Gui Yingxiang, a representative of scientists and Chairman of the Korean Agricultural Science Committee, emphasized in his speech that US imperialism must immediately get out of South Korea. Hyun Joon-geuk, Deputy Editor-in-Chief of "Rodong Sinmun," who spoke on behalf of journalists at the meeting, called on South Korean journalists to rise up and demand genuine freedom of publication, assembly, and association.
    The conference finally adopted an appeal to peace-loving people around the world.
    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 24th - Newspapers here today published the appeal to peace-loving people around the world passed and issued by the Korean National Peace Conference, calling on peace-loving people of all countries to resolutely sanction the crimes of aggression committed by US imperialism in Korea.
    The appeal emphasized that for the peaceful reunification of Korea and the elimination of the source of war in Korea and the Far East, first of all, the US aggressor troops must get out of South Korea. The US government must transport all the murderous weapons such as atomic weapons and missile weapons illegally brought into South Korea back to the United States, and withdraw its troops from South Korea. The governments of other countries that followed US imperialism and sent troops to South Korea must also immediately withdraw their troops from South Korea. The United Nations must abolish all the shameful "resolutions" on the Korean issue illegally passed under the pressure of US imperialism for more than a decade, and should no longer allow US imperialism to steal the banner of the United Nations to carry out aggression against Korea. The "United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea," a tool of US imperialism, must be disbanded, and measures must be taken immediately to withdraw US troops from South Korea.
    The appeal stated that the fate of the Korean people themselves should be resolved by the Korean people themselves, and US imperialism is not allowed to interfere. In order to realize the demands of the South Korean people who are fighting a bloody battle, the Syngman Rhee fascist ruling institution must be completely abolished, all laws suppressing the people must be abolished, freedom of activity of all political parties and social organizations must be guaranteed, and the democratic rights of the people must be guaranteed. The appeal emphasized that the proposal we put forward to convene a joint conference of political parties and social organizations in North and South Korea has aroused a huge response among the South Korean people, and the time is even more ripe. To clean up the situation in South Korea as soon as possible and solve the life-and-death demands of the South Korean people, the only way out is for representatives from the North and the South to gather together for consultation.
    The appeal said that the tenth anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean War - "June 25th" - is coming soon, and seven years have passed since the Korean armistice, but Korea has not yet been reunified, the armistice has not yet led to consolidated peace, and the dark clouds of the danger of war still shrouded over the Korean people have not been eliminated.
    The appeal said that after the armistice, the political and economic situation in South Korea deteriorated further, and finally, a mass resistance and struggle of the people for freedom, democracy, and the right to survival broke out in South Korea. The appeal pointed out that the root cause of this serious situation in South Korea today is the colonial enslavement policy of US imperialism, and the US ruling group cannot escape this responsibility. The appeal said that the history of the US military's occupation of South Korea for fifteen years is full of the shameful record of US imperialism stifling freedom and democracy, carrying out aggression and plunder, and hindering the peaceful reunification of Korea. The appeal said: We accuse the US imperialism of the crimes it committed in South Korea to the conscientious people all over the world. The appeal severely condemned US imperialism for obstructing the peaceful reunification of Korea - violating the armistice agreement, aggravating the tense situation, and engaging in provocative conspiracies. The appeal said: US imperialism also completely rejected the just proposals repeatedly put forward by the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. The appeal emphasized: US imperialism must immediately get out of South Korea, Japan, South Vietnam, Taiwan, and other Asian, African, and Latin American regions! In order to oppose the imperialists, let us unite the strength and voices of our good people; in order to make the flowers of peace and friendship bloom all over the world, unite and carry out a resolute struggle! The organizations that jointly issued this appeal are: the Korean National Peace Committee, the Korean Committee for Solidarity with Asia and Africa, the Korean Vocational General League, the Korean Democratic Youth League, the Korean Democratic Women's League, and the Korean Student League.

    朝鲜各界代表在全国和平会议上发出正义吼声
    美帝国主义立刻从南朝鲜滚出去
    呼吁世界人民坚决制裁美国侵略朝鲜的罪行
    新华社平壤24日电　这里的报纸今天报道：在美帝国主义发动侵朝战争的日子——“六·二五”十周年即将到来的时候，朝鲜全国和平会议23日在平壤市牡丹峰剧场举行。会议谴责美帝国主义侵略和分裂朝鲜的罪行，支持南朝鲜人民的正义斗争，并且通过给全世界爱好和平人民的呼吁书，呼吁全世界爱好和平的人民坚决制裁美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的罪行。
    参加这次大会的人中有：朝鲜内阁副首相洪命熹，世界和平理事会理事、朝鲜拥护和平全国民族委员会常务委员朴正爱，朝鲜拥护和平全国民族委员会的委员们和劳动人民的代表，以及科学、文化界人士。世界和平理事会理事、朝鲜拥护和平全国民族委员会委员长韩雪野在会上讲话指出，美帝国主义强占南朝鲜十五年的历史，就是它作为和平的敌人、发动侵略战争、分裂朝鲜、实行殖民地掠夺的罪恶的纪录。美帝国主义的这种罪行必定要受到全体朝鲜人民和世界人民的庄严的审判。
    他说，由于美帝国主义的侵略政策和它的走狗的卖国行动，南朝鲜的政治、经济和各个方面都处于深刻的危机之中，南朝鲜人民正以鲜血为争取自由和生存权利起来进行英勇的斗争。目前南朝鲜的局势完全揭下了美国式的“自由”和“民主”的假面具，暴露了它在“反共”的借口下用大炮、坦克和刀枪强占其它国家的强盗面目。
    韩雪野指出，美帝国主义是朝鲜人民的不共戴天的民族敌人。它无论玩弄什么手法也无法掩盖它在朝鲜的侵略行为。
    韩雪野强调说，朝鲜的主人是朝鲜人，朝鲜的命运应由朝鲜人民自己来决定。美国侵略军必须带着它非法运入的原子武器和导弹武器等一切杀人武器立即滚出去，受美国帝国主义的雇佣进入南朝鲜的其他各国的军队也必须回他们的本国去。
    韩雪野强调指出，朝鲜人民为使美帝国主义撤出南朝鲜和和平统一祖国的救国斗争，是同全世界人民反对帝国主义，争取自由、独立和和平的斗争直接联结在一起的。在全世界人民的热烈支持声援下，朝鲜人民的正义斗争必定取得胜利。
    韩雪野在讲话中还严厉谴责美帝国主义破坏四国首脑会议，同岸信介集团强行“通过”新日美“安全条约”等新的罪行，并表示积极支持和声援日本人民的正义斗争。
    接着，各界人民代表在大会上讲了话。朝鲜职业总同盟中央委员会副委员长朴尚弘代表工人在会上讲话时，主张迅速召开南北朝鲜各政党、社会团体联席会议，讨论救济和安定南朝鲜人民生活的对策。科学家代表、朝鲜农业科学委员会委员长桂应祥在讲话当中，强调美帝国主义必须立即从南朝鲜滚出去。代表新闻工作者在会上讲话的“劳动新闻”副总编辑玄峻极讲话时号召南朝鲜新闻界人士起来要求真正的出版、集会、结社的自由。
    大会最后通过了给全世界爱好和平人民的呼吁书。
    据新华社平壤24日电　此间报纸今天刊载了朝鲜全国和平会议通过和发出的给全世界爱好和平人民的呼吁书，呼吁爱好和平的各国人民坚决制裁美帝国主义在朝鲜犯下的侵略罪行。
    呼吁书强调：为了朝鲜的和平统一，消除朝鲜和远东的战争策源地，首先美国侵略军必须从南朝鲜滚出去。美国政府必须把非法运入南朝鲜的原子武器、导弹武器等一切杀人武器运回美国，从南朝鲜撤回它的军队。追随美帝国主义派有军队在南朝鲜的其他国家的政府也必须立即从南朝鲜把它们的军队撤走。联合国必须取消十几年来在美帝国主义的压力下非法通过的一切关于朝鲜问题的可耻的“决议”，再不应让美帝国主义盗用联合国的旗帜进行侵略朝鲜的行动。必须解散美帝国主义的御用工具——“联合国朝鲜统一复兴委员会”，并立即采取使美军撤出南朝鲜的措施。
    呼吁书说：朝鲜人民自己的命运应由朝鲜人民自己来解决，不许美帝国主义干涉。为了实现进行浴血斗争的南朝鲜人民的要求，必须完全废除李承晚法西斯统治机构，废除一切镇压人民的法令，保证一切政党、社会团体的自由活动，保证人民的民主权利。呼吁书强调，我们提出的召开南北朝鲜各政党和社会团体联席会议的建议在南朝鲜人民中间引起了巨大的反应，时机更加成熟了。要早日收拾南朝鲜的局势，解决南朝鲜人民的生死攸关的要求，唯一的出路就是南北代表聚集在一起进行协商。
    呼吁书说：朝鲜战争爆发的日子——“六·二五”十周年就要到来了，朝鲜停战后已过了七年，但是朝鲜还没有统一，停战还未能导向巩固的和平，笼罩在朝鲜人民头上的战争危险的乌云还没有消除。
    呼吁书说：停战后，南朝鲜的政治、经济局面更加恶化了 ，并终于在南朝鲜爆发了人民争取自由、民主和生存权利的群众性的反抗和斗争。呼吁书指出，今天南朝鲜造成的这种严重局势的一切根源，就是美帝国主义的殖民地奴役政策，美国统治集团绝不能逃避这个责任。呼吁书说，美军强占南朝鲜十五年来的历史，充满了美帝国主义扼杀自由和民主、进行侵略和掠夺、阻挠朝鲜的和平统一的可耻的纪录。呼吁书说：我们向有良心的全世界人民控诉美帝国主义在南朝鲜犯下的罪行。呼吁书严厉谴责美帝国主义阻挠朝鲜的和平统一——违反停战协定、加剧紧张局势、进行挑衅阴谋的活动。呼吁书说：美帝国主义还全部拒绝了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府多次提出的关于和平解决朝鲜问题的公正的方案。呼吁书强调：美帝国主义必须立即从南朝鲜、日本、南越、台湾以及其他亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲地区滚出去！为了反对帝国主义者，把我们善良的人们的力量和呼声汇合起来；为了使和平友谊的花朵开遍全世界，团结起来进行坚决的斗争！联合发表这一呼吁书的团体是：朝鲜拥护和平全国民族委员会、朝鲜亚非团结委员会、朝鲜职业总同盟、朝鲜民主青年同盟、朝鲜民主妇女同盟、朝鲜学生同盟。
