Comrades, friends:
    To oppose the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, to oppose the occupation and enslavement by U.S. imperialism, to overthrow the traitorous reactionary Kishi Nobusuke government, and to strive for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality, the heroic Japanese people and Japanese youth have waged an unyielding struggle against the U.S.-Japan reactionaries. Today, a larger and more powerful unified action struggle is fiercely unfolding throughout Japan. The Chinese youth express the greatest respect and the most resolute support for the patriotic and just struggle of the Japanese people and Japanese youth.
    The U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty is a treaty in which the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries collude to prepare for a new war. U.S. imperialism, headed by Eisenhower, attempts to accelerate the revival of Japanese militarism through this treaty and realize its sinister plot of "Asians fighting Asians." The Japanese militaristic forces, represented by Kishi Nobusuke, attempt to rely on the United States through this treaty to realize their ambition of expansion into Asia. It is very clear that the establishment of the U.S.-Japan military alliance not only drags the Japanese people onto the path of war, death, and disaster, but also poses a serious threat to the security of China, the Soviet Union, Asian countries, and world peace. The Chinese people and Chinese youth, who have suffered deeply from the aggression of U.S. imperialism and Japanese militarism, cannot ignore this blatant provocation and cannot allow the revival of Japanese militaristic forces. The struggle against the common enemy, the U.S.-Japan reactionaries, has linked us and the Japanese people more closely. If the U.S.-Japan reactionaries insist on imposing war on the Chinese people and the people of Asian countries, then the Chinese people, who have long experience in victorious struggles, and the awakened Asian people know how to teach them a lesson.
    The signing of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty once again exposed the hideous face of U.S. imperialism, revealing its aggressive nature. It exposed U.S. imperialism as the culprit of disturbing world peace and the common enemy of the people of the world. Now, U.S. imperialism has become the target of public condemnation in front of the people of the world. It is like a rat running across the street; everyone shouts "kill it!". The Japanese people have risen up, the South Korean people have risen up, and the Turkish people have risen up. A national and democratic struggle sweeping across Asia, Africa, and Latin America is surging forward. The situation is extremely favorable. The days are not long before the final end of imperialism and its running dogs. No matter what tricks the enemy plays, whether soft or hard, they cannot save their doomed fate. The Chinese youth firmly believe that as long as we unite more closely, remain vigilant, make persistent efforts, and persevere in the struggle, victory will surely belong to us, to the Chinese people, to the Japanese people, and to the people of the world.
    Let us once again shout:
    Oppose the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty!
    Oppose the revival of Japanese militarism!
    Down with U.S. imperialism!
    U.S. imperialism get out of Japan! Get out of South Korea! Get out of South Vietnam! Get out of Turkey! Get out of Taiwan, our territory!

### 不许日本军国主义势力复活  共青团中央书记处书记罗毅的讲话

    不许日本军国主义势力复活
    共青团中央书记处书记罗毅的讲话同志们，朋友们：
    为了反对日美军事同盟条约，为了反对美帝国主义的占领和奴役，为了打倒卖国的岸信介反动政府，为了争取独立、民主、和平和中立，英勇的日本人民和日本青年，向日美反动派进行了不屈不挠的斗争。今天，一个规模更大、更强有力的统一行动的斗争，又在日本全国各地猛烈地开展起来了。中国青年对于日本人民和日本青年的爱国正义斗争，表示最大的敬意和最坚决的支持。
    日美军事同盟条约，是美日反动派狼狈为奸，准备发动新战争的条约。以艾森豪威尔为首的美帝国主义，企图通过这个条约，加紧复活日本军国主义，实现其“亚洲人打亚洲人”的罪恶阴谋；以岸信介为代表的日本军国主义势力，则企图通过这个条约，依附美国实现其向亚洲进行扩张的野心。十分明显，日美军事同盟的建立，不仅把日本人民拖上了战争、死亡、灾难的道路，而且对于中国、对于苏联，对于亚洲各国的安全和世界和平，也是很严重的威胁。曾经饱受美帝国主义和日本军国主义侵略祸害的中国人民和中国青年，决不能无视这一公然的挑衅，决不能容许日本军国主义势力的复活。反对共同敌人美日反动派的斗争，已经把我们和日本人民更紧密地联结起来。如果美日反动派硬要把战争强加在中国人民和亚洲各国人民的头上，那末，有着长久胜利斗争经验的中国人民和已经觉醒了的亚洲人民，是知道怎样教训他们的。
    日美军事同盟条约的签订，又一次暴露了美帝国主义侵略成性的狰狞面貌，暴露了美帝国主义是扰乱世界安宁的罪魁祸首，是全世界人民的公敌。现在，美帝国主义在全世界人民面前，已经是众矢之的，老鼠过街，人人喊打。日本人民已经起来了，南朝鲜人民起来了，土耳其人民起来了。一个席卷整个亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族、民主的斗争，正在风起云涌地向前发展着。形势极为有利，现在已经离最后结束帝国主义及其走狗们的寿命的时日不长久了。不管敌人还会玩弄一些什么样的花招，软的也罢，硬的也罢，都不能挽救它们注定了要死亡的命运。中国青年坚决相信，只要我们更加紧密的团结起来，保持警惕，再接再厉，坚持斗争，胜利一定是属于我们的，属于中国人民，属于日本人民，属于全世界人民的。
    让我们再一次高呼：
    反对日美军事同盟条约！
    反对复活日本军国主义！
    打倒美帝国主义！
    美帝国主义从日本滚出去！从南朝鲜滚出去！从南越滚出去！从土耳其滚出去！从我国领土台湾滚出去！
