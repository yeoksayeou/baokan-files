Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot: A scene of abundant harvest has appeared in Inner Mongolia's animal husbandry production. By the end of April, the region had delivered 6.8 million lambs and more than 320,000 head of large livestock offspring, an increase of 1.51 million and 270,000 respectively compared to the same period last year. In addition, more than 4 million head of female livestock are awaiting delivery.

This year, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region not only increased the number of newborn animals, but also improved the survival rate and quality of young animals. This is the result of the large-scale improvement of livestock and the development of the "100 Mothers, 100 Offspring" movement by the people's communes on the animal husbandry front. "Safe herds" with millions of adult livestock have appeared in various places, and the loss of various types of livestock has been greatly reduced. At present, 86 communes, brigades, teams, and 2,700 livestock groups in the region have achieved "100 Mothers, 100 Offspring." Due to the adoption of the method of "three combinations" of herdsmen, lambing attendants, and veterinary technicians, and the strengthening of the feeding and management of young animals, the survival rate of large and small livestock offspring has been increased to over 90%.

Among the various types of newborn animals currently delivered, there are 1.29 million improved lambs and 20,000 improved foals and calves, and the number of various improved breeds of young animals has greatly increased compared to the same period last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou: Gansu Province has achieved a great spring lamb harvest. As of April 25, more than 1.55 million lambs have been born from 3.37 million ewes in the province. The survival rate of lambs reached over 95%, an increase of about 20% compared to last year. The remaining pregnant ewes are giving birth successively.

The characteristics of this year's spring lamb harvest are: large areas of high and abundant production, large quantities, high survival rate, strong mothers, and fat lambs. Since the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a pig and sheep raising conference last winter, the people's communes in various agricultural and pastoral areas have firmly grasped the work of protecting livestock over the winter and preparing for protection of fetuses and lambing. Various places have sufficient forage reserves, which has basically changed the phenomenon of livestock being thin in winter and weak in spring. Before the arrival of the lambing season, various places built warm sheds, lambing rooms, heated kangs, and stoves for ewes and lambs. After Xihe People's Commune in Yongchang County implemented the system of zonal rotational grazing and strengthened feeding management, four groups of 1,000 mothers and 1,000 lambs, four groups of 100 mothers and over 100 lambs, and 100 mothers and 100 lambs appeared, with a survival rate of 99%. In the eighteen communes in Jingyuan County and Baiyin City, more than 1,900 ewes gave birth to twins this year.

This newspaper reports: Under the guidance of the principle of "taking pigs as the head, raising pigs and sheep simultaneously, and making all six animals prosper," Yunnan Province has achieved rapid development in sheep farming. The net increase of mountain and sheep in the province in four months is more than twice the total increase for the entire year last year.

Yunnan Province has good natural conditions for developing sheep farming at high speed. It has abundant natural pastures, a mild climate, and a long period of green grass, and many areas are suitable for grazing all year round. The Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed the principle of "taking pigs as the head, raising pigs and sheep simultaneously, and making all six animals prosper" for developing animal husbandry, in light of local conditions. According to this principle of the Provincial Party Committee, Party committees at all levels widely publicized the benefits of raising sheep among the masses as early as the end of last year. Party organizations at all levels quickly grasped the sheep raising business like they did with pig raising. Qujing Prefecture has greatly grasped the spring mating of sheep, breaking the superstition that "hot mating cannot raise them alive" and "only one lamb per litter per year," and vigorously promoting advanced experiences such as hot mating, re-mating, and artificial insemination. At present, the conception rate of ewes in the region has reached about 80%. Because many areas in the province have grasped the autumn mating last year, the reproduction rate has increased this spring, making the province break through the historical decline caused by excessive slaughtering for the first time, and won a new victory of a good start, just like on the pig raising front.

    仔畜产得多成活率高母壮儿肥   
    内蒙古甘肃春羔大丰收
    云南利用优越条件迅速发展养羊事业
    据新华社呼和浩特电　内蒙古畜牧业生产出现一片丰收景象。到4月底，全区已接羊羔六百八十万只，大家畜仔畜三十二万多头，比去年同期分别增加了一百五十一万只和二十七万多头。此外，还有四百多万头母畜待产。
    今年自治区畜牧业不仅增殖仔畜多，而且幼畜的成活率高、质量好。这是畜牧业战线上的各人民公社大规模改良牲畜，开展“百母百仔”运动的结果。各地出现了有数百万头成年牲畜的“安全群”，各类牲畜的损失大大减少。目前，全区已有八十六个公社、大队、小队和二千七百个畜群，实现了“百母百仔”。由于各族人民采取了放牧饲养员、接羔保育员和兽医技术员“三结合”的办法，加强了仔畜的饲养管理，使大、小牲畜的仔畜成活率都提高到90％以上。
    目前接产的各类仔畜中，有一百二十九万只改良羊羔和两万头改良马驹、牛犊，各种良种仔畜都比去年同期有很大增长。
    据新华社兰州电　甘肃省春季羊羔大丰收。截至4月25日，全省三百三十七万只适龄母羊，已产羔一百五十五万多只。羔羊成活率达95％以上，比去年提高了20％左右。其余的怀胎母羊，正在陆续产羔。
    今年春季羊羔丰收的特点是：高额丰产面积大，数量多，成活率高，母壮羔肥。去年冬季，中共甘肃省委召开养猪养羊会议以来，各农牧区人民公社都狠狠地抓了保畜过冬工作和保胎、接羔的准备工作。各地饲草贮备充足，基本上改变了过去牲畜冬瘦春乏的现象。产羔季节到来以前，各地都给母羊、羔羊修搭了暖棚、接羔室、热炕、火炉等。永昌县西河人民公社实行分区轮牧和加强饲养管理制度以后，出现了四个千母千羔群，四个百母超百羔群和百母百羔群，成活率达到99％。靖远县和白银市的十八个公社中，今年有一千九百多只母羊一胎双羔。
    本报讯　云南省在“以猪为首，猪羊并举，六畜兴旺”的方针指导下，养羊事业获得了迅速的发展。全省四个月净增加的山、绵羊，比去年全年增长的总数还多两倍多。
    云南省具有高速度发展养羊事业的良好自然条件。天然牧场丰富，气候温和，青草期长，许多地区四季都宜于放牧。中共云南省委因地制宜地提出了“以猪为首，猪羊并举，六畜兴旺”的发展畜牧业的方针。根据省委这一方针，各级党委早在去年底就在群众中广泛宣传养羊的好处。各级党组织很快把养羊事业像养猪那样抓了起来。曲靖专区大抓羊的春配，破除“热配养不活”“每年只能一胎一羔”等迷信思想，大力推广热配、复配、人工授精等先进经验。目前全区适龄母羊受胎率已达到80％左右。由于全省许多地区抓紧了去年的秋配，今年春季的繁殖率增加，使全省第一次突破了历来春季因宰杀多而带来的下降的状况，和养猪战线一样，夺得了开门红的新胜利。
