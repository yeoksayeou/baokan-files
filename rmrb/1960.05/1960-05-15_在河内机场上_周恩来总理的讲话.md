Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 14th: The full text of Premier Zhou Enlai's farewell speech at Hanoi Airport today is as follows:

Dear Comrade Premier Pham Van Dong, dear comrades and friends:

In a few minutes, we will be leaving you. Before leaving, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude once again to Chairman Ho Chi Minh for his kind care, and to Premier Pham Van Dong, the Vietnamese government, and the Vietnamese people for their warm reception and enthusiastic welcome. Since we arrived in your country five days ago, wherever we went, day or night, we were met with enthusiastic and friendly cheers. From the elderly to innocent children, everyone waved and smiled at us. Whether in the cities or in the countryside, everywhere was filled with sincere and moving brotherly affection. We felt from the bottom of our hearts that we have been living in a warm, internationalist family, and each of us felt very happy and delighted. I assure you that we will bring this brotherly affection of the Vietnamese people to the 650 million Chinese people.

Comrades and friends, it is exciting to visit you here. Your country, under the leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party, the Vietnamese government, and Chairman Ho Chi Minh, is developing rapidly. Today's Vietnam is very different from when we first visited. The scars left by the war are no longer visible. What we see are new factories, new farms, and a thriving scene. We are encouraged by the brilliant achievements made by the Vietnamese people in the great cause of building socialism. We will certainly convey the Vietnamese people's labor enthusiasm and construction achievements to the Chinese people, so that the people of our two brotherly countries can encourage each other, learn from each other, and advance hand in hand in the labor of creating their own better lives.

During this visit, we held talks with the leading comrades of the Vietnam Workers' Party and the Vietnamese government, and fully exchanged views on issues related to our two countries and international issues of common concern. And we reached a complete consensus. This is of great significance for further strengthening mutual assistance and cooperation between our two countries and close coordination in international affairs. At present, the domestic situation in our two countries is very good, and the overall international situation is also very favorable to us. Under this excellent situation, we will unite even more closely with all countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and unite with all peace-loving countries and people in the world, to make greater efforts for the noble cause of striving for human progress and maintaining world peace.

Long live the Democratic Republic of Vietnam!

Long live the eternal friendship between the Chinese and Vietnamese people!

Long live the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

Long live world peace!

    在河内机场上
    周恩来总理的讲话
    新华社河内14日电　周恩来总理今天在河内机场上发表的告别讲话全文如下：亲爱的范文同总理同志，亲爱的同志们，朋友们：
    再过几分钟我们就要离开你们了。临走之前，我愿意再一次向你们表示衷心的感谢，感谢胡志明主席对我们的亲切的照顾，感谢范文同总理、越南政府和越南人民对我们的热情的接待和热烈的欢迎。自从五天以前我们到达你们的国家以来，不论白天或夜晚，我们走到那里，那里就沸腾着热情友好的呼声。从年迈的老人到天真的儿童，都向我们招手欢笑；不论在城市或在农村，到处洋溢着真挚动人的兄弟感情。我们从心底里感觉到，我们一直是生活在国际主义的温暖的大家庭里，我们每个人都感到十分愉快和高兴。我向大家保证，我们一定把越南人民的这种亲如手足的情谊，带给六亿五千万中国人民。
    同志们，朋友们，在你们这里访问是令人感到兴奋的。你们的国家在越南劳动党、越南政府和胡志明主席的领导下，正在日新月异地向前发展。今天的越南已经同我们第一次访问时的情况大不相同。战争遗留下来的创伤看不到了，我们看到的是新的工厂，新的农庄和一片欣欣向荣的景象。越南人民在建设社会主义的伟大事业中所取得辉煌成就使我们感到欢欣鼓舞。我们一定把越南人民的劳动热情和建设成就转告中国人民，让我们两个兄弟国家的人民，在创造自己美好生活的劳动中相互鼓励，相互学习，携手前进。
    在这次访问期间，我们同越南劳动党、越南政府的领导同志进行了会谈，就有关两国的问题和共同关心的国际问题充分地交换了意见。并且取得了完全一致的看法。这对于进一步加强我们两国的互助合作和在国际事务中的密切配合具有重大的意义。现在，我们两国的国内形势都非常好，总的国际形势也对我们十分有利。在这个大好的形势之下，我们将更加紧密地同以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国团结在一起，同全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民团结在一起，为争取人类进步和维护世界和平的崇高事业作出更大的努力。
    越南民主共和国万岁！
    中越两国人民之间永恒的友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
