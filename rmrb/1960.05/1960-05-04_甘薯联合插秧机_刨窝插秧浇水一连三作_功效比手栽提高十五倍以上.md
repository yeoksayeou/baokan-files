Sweet Potato Combined Transplanter
Digs Holes, Transplants Seedlings, and Waters in One Operation
Efficiency Increased More Than Fifteen Times Compared to Manual Planting

    (Our report) The Tiemu United Factory of Linzi Commune in Linyi County, Shandong Province, recently created a sweet potato combined transplanter that can dig holes, transplant seedlings, and water in one continuous operation. This transplanter is operated by two people and one animal. It digs holes, transplants seedlings (including automatic seedling separation), and waters simultaneously. It can plant one mu of sweet potatoes per hour, increasing efficiency more than fifteen times compared to manual operation.
    The employees of the Tiemu United Factory of this commune, recognizing that the commune's sweet potato farming tools had all been reformed, except for the laborious transplanting tools, were determined to break through this bottleneck. Under the leadership and support of the commune's Party committee, they worked hard day and night and experimented repeatedly. The commune's Party Secretary, the Minister of Industry, the factory's Party Branch Secretary, and the factory director also conducted research and experiments with the workers. After more than a month of hard work and sixteen experiments, they finally succeeded in trial-manufacturing it.
    On April 15th, the Minister of the Industry Department of the Linyi County Party Committee, the Director of the County Science and Technology Commission, the Commune Party Secretary, and comrades from the Provincial Science and Technology Association, together with the factory's employees and some commune members, conducted on-site tests, and the results were good. Everyone agreed that this transplanter has the characteristics of simple operation, high work efficiency, good transplanting quality, and low cost. General commune industries can manufacture it (see the attached diagram for its structure). Promoting this tool will greatly increase sweet potato farming efficiency. (Attached picture)

    甘薯联合插秧机
    刨窝插秧浇水一连三作
    功效比手栽提高十五倍以上
    本报讯　山东临邑县林子公社铁木联合厂，最近创制了一部能够刨窝、插秧、浇水，一连三作的地瓜（即甘薯）联合插秧机。这部插秧机由两人和一头牲口操作，随刨窝、随插秧（包括自动分秧）、随浇水，一小时能栽地瓜一亩，比手工操作提高效率十五倍以上。
    这个公社的铁木联合厂的职工，鉴于本社地瓜耕作工具都有所改革，唯有费工比较多的插秧工具没有改革，就决心突破这一环。他们在公社党委的领导和支持下，昼夜苦钻，反复试验。公社的党委书记、工业部长、厂党支部书记、厂长，也和工人们一起进行研究试验。经过一个多月苦钻和十六次试验，终于试制成功。
    四月十五日，中共临邑县委工业部部长、县科学技术委员会主任、公社党委书记以及省科学技术协会的同志，会同这个厂的职工及公社的部分社员一起进行了现场试验，效果良好。大家一致认为这种插秧机具有操作简便、工效高、插秧质量好、造价低廉等特点，一般公社工业都可以制造（其构造参看附图）。推广这种工具，将大大提高地瓜耕作效率。（附图片）
