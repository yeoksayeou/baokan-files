Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch from Washington: The White House yesterday released a letter written by U.S. President Eisenhower to Syngman Rhee on the 5th. This letter exposes the U.S. rulers' efforts to maintain their enslavement of the South Korean people.

　　Eisenhower, in his letter, revealed his deep unease about the development of the South Korean people's patriotic struggle that forced Syngman Rhee to step down. He said, "No one has watched the development of events with more anxious sympathy than I." He also assured this dictator fostered by the United States that the United States would continue to support the puppet regime in order to intensify its control over South Korea. He said, "The United States will continue to feel a strong sympathetic connection to Korea under the leadership of your (Syngman Rhee's) successors."

　　Eisenhower lavishly praised Syngman Rhee's traitorous crimes, saying that his actions in colluding with the American invading army to massacre the Korean people had "won the admiration of the entire free world and the gratitude of all the Korean people," and described his crimes of ruthlessly exploiting the South Korean people on American orders as "great achievements."

　　News from Seoul said that Syngman Rhee, after receiving Eisenhower's letter, expressed that he was "very moved." He acknowledged that the attitude of the American rulers was "very important" to the South Korean puppet regime. He said, "President Eisenhower and the U.S. government will continue to be our primary reliance for our very survival for freedom."

　　On the same day that Eisenhower's letter of consolation to Syngman Rhee was released, White House spokesman Hagerty said that Eisenhower would visit Syngman Rhee during his visit to South Korea in June.

    美总统写信抚慰李承晚
    表示美国耍赖在南朝鲜
    新华社10日讯　华盛顿消息：白宫昨天公布了美国总统艾森豪威尔在5日写给李承晚的信。这封信暴露了美国统治者正在竭力保持对南朝鲜人民的奴役。
    艾森豪威尔在信里流露了他对迫使李承晚下台的南朝鲜人民爱国斗争的发展感到深切不安。他说：“没有人比我更多地怀着焦虑的同情注视着事态的发展。”他还向美国豢养的这个独夫保证：美国将继续扶持傀儡政权，以便加紧对南朝鲜的控制。他说：“美国将继续感到它对你（李承晚）的继任者领导下的朝鲜有着强烈的同情的联系。”
    艾森豪威尔对李承晚的卖国罪行赞扬备至，说他协同美国侵略军屠杀朝鲜人民的行为“博得了整个自由世界的钦佩和全体朝鲜人民的感激”，并且把他执行美国命令残酷压榨南朝鲜人民的罪行说成是“丰功伟绩”。
    来自汉城的消息说，李承晚接到艾森豪威尔的信后，表示“非常感动”。他承认，美国统治者的态度对南朝鲜傀儡政权是“非常重要”的。他说：“艾森豪威尔总统和美国政府将继续是我们争取自由生存本身的首要依靠”。
    在公布艾森豪威尔给李承晚的抚慰信的同一天，白宫发言人哈格蒂说，艾森豪威尔在6月间访问南朝鲜的时候，将去访问李承晚。
