Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 14th -- Nguyễn Xuân Thủy, Vice-Chairman of the Vietnam Asian-African People's Solidarity Committee, said in a report at the Vietnam Asian-African People's Solidarity Movement Congress held this afternoon, "The Asian and African people have a common enemy, which is imperialism and colonialism headed by U.S. imperialism. Without opposing them, there can be no independence, no freedom, no peace and no happiness."

    Nguyễn Xuân Thủy also pointed out that colonialism and imperialism will not perish on their own. The oppressed people and the people of the world must unite to eliminate them.

    This congress was convened by the Vietnam Asian-African People's Solidarity Committee to summarize its work over the past three years. Deputy Prime Minister Phan Kế Toại, Chairman of the Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace Lê Đình Thám, and others attended the congress.

    In his report, Nguyễn Xuân Thủy also said that the important reason for the great victories achieved by the national independence movement and the peace movement in the Asian and African regions in recent years is the strength of the socialist camp. Imperialism and colonialism can no longer easily threaten and suppress the Asian and African people as they did in the past, because the Asian and African people are always supported by sincere, heroic, and powerful friends such as the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries.

    Nguyễn Xuân Thủy condemned some pro-American elements in the Lao Kingdom government for slandering the Democratic Republic of Vietnam at the instigation of U.S. imperialism.

    Subsequently, Tôn Quang Phiệt, head of the Vietnamese delegation to the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, reported to the congress on the great achievements of the Conakry Conference and expressed his gratitude to the Asian and African people for their support of Vietnam's struggle for the reunification of the fatherland.

    The congress re-elected the leading body of the Vietnam Asian-African People's Solidarity Committee. Tôn Quang Phiệt was re-elected as Chairman. The Vice-Chairmen are: Nguyễn Xuân Thủy, Hoàng Minh Giám, Lê Minh Hiền (female), and Nguyễn Văn Hưởng.

    Many representatives from various groups and regions also spoke at today's congress.

    Xinhua News Agency, 13th -- The Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee today sent a telegram to the Vietnam Asian-African People's Solidarity Committee, warmly congratulating the opening of the Vietnam Asian-African Solidarity Movement National Congress.

    In its congratulatory telegram, the Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee extended brotherly and high respect to the Vietnamese people, who have made great achievements in socialist construction and have made important contributions to strengthening Asian-African solidarity and defending Indochina and world peace.

    The telegram said: "The struggle of the Asian-African people and the Latin American people against colonialism and imperialism, especially against U.S. imperialism, is developing vigorously. Recently, the people of South Korea, the people of Turkey, and the people of Japan have launched patriotic and just struggles against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs. The national democratic liberation movement of the oppressed people cannot be stopped or bound by any force. Recently, the successfully concluded Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference once again proved that the Asian and African people are determined to completely eradicate all colonialist and imperialist aggressive forces.

    "The Chinese people and the Vietnamese people are as close as brothers, and regard the struggle of the Vietnamese people as their own struggle. The Chinese people resolutely support the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression and obstruction of Vietnam's reunification. We firmly believe that the Vietnamese people's national aspiration for the reunification of their motherland will surely be realized."

    阮春水在越南亚非人民团结运动大会上说
    美帝国主义是亚非人民的公敌
    我国亚非团结委员会电贺大会召开
    新华社河内14日电　越南亚非人民团结委员会副主席阮春水在今天下午举行的越南亚非人民团结运动大会上作报告时说，“亚非人民有一个共同的敌人，就是以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义和殖民主义。不反对他们就不能有独立、自由，就没有和平和幸福。”
    阮春水还指出，殖民主义和帝国主义不会自行灭亡。被压迫的人民和全世界人民必须团结起来消灭它们。
    这个大会是越南亚非人民团结委员会为总结三年来的工作而召开的。潘继遂副总理、越南保卫世界和平委员会主席黎廷探等出席了大会。
    阮春水在报告中还说，几年来在亚非地区，民族独立运动以及和平运动取得巨大胜利的重要原因，是社会主义阵营的强大。帝国主义、殖民主义再也不能像过去那样轻易地威胁和镇压亚非人民了，因为亚非人民的身旁随时都站着苏联、中国和其他社会主义国家那样真诚的、豪迈的、强大的朋友。
    阮春水谴责了老挝王国政府中的一些亲美分子在美帝国主义的唆使下对越南民主共和国的诬蔑。
    接着，出席第二届亚非人民团结大会的越南代表团团长孙光阀向大会报告了科纳克里会议所取得的巨大成就，并表示感谢亚非人民对越南统一祖国斗争的支持。
    大会改选了越南亚非人民团结委员会的领导机构。孙光阀再次当选为主席。副主席有：阮春水、黄明鉴、黎明贤（女）、阮文享。
    在今天大会上发言的还有各团体、各地的代表多人。
    据新华社13日讯　中国亚非团结委员会今天打电报给越南亚非人民团结委员会，热烈祝贺越南亚非团结运动全国大会的召开。
    中国亚非团结委员会在贺电中向在社会主义建设中取得了巨大成就、在加强亚非团结、保卫印度支那及世界和平的事业中作出了重要贡献的越南人民，致兄弟般的崇高的敬意。
    贺电说：“亚非人民以及拉丁美洲人民反对殖民主义和帝国主义，特别是反对美帝国主义的斗争，正在日益蓬勃地发展。最近南朝鲜人民、土耳其人民和日本人民掀起了反对美帝国主义及其走狗的爱国正义斗争，被压迫人民的民族民主解放运动是任何力量阻挡不住，束缚不了的。最近，胜利召开的第二届亚非人民团结大会再次证明：亚非人民决心要把一切殖民主义和帝国主义的侵略势力彻底铲除掉。
    “中国人民和越南人民亲如手足，把越南人民的斗争看做自己的斗争。中国人民坚决支持越南人民反对美帝国主义侵略和阻挠越南统一的斗争。我们深信，越南人民统一祖国的民族愿望必定实现。”
