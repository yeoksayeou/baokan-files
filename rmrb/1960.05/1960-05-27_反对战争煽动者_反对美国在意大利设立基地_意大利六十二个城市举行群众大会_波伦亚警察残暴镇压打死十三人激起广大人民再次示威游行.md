Xinhua News Agency, May 25th, Rome dispatch: The Italian Communist Party organized mass rallies in sixty-two cities in Italy on the 22nd to oppose war instigators and oppose the establishment of American bases in Italy.

On the 21st, a mass rally with thousands of participants in Bologna was dispersed by the police. Police beat thirteen people to death with batons. Italian Communist Party parliamentarians Pajetta, Bottonelli, and nine citizens of Bologna who participated in the rally were arrested after the assembly was dispersed. They were accused of "contempt of government," "insulting foreign heads of state," and "opposing the authorities." Bottonelli was severely injured by the police and is currently hospitalized.

According to "Unità," the cases of Pajetta and others have been submitted to the court. This police attack aroused public indignation. On the 22nd, thirty-five demonstrations took place throughout Bologna to protest the police provocation.

"Unità" also reported that the police dispersed a rally organized by the Italian Communist Party in the city of Imola. At this rally, when a speaker, representing the working people of Imola, expressed support for the struggle of the people of Bologna, the rally was dispersed. However, after the police dispersed, the attendees reassembled in a theater and unanimously passed a resolution of protest, sharply condemning the actions of the police.

According to Italian newspapers, a group of parliamentarians from the Veneto region had raised questions in parliament about the two bases established by NATO in the Veneto region. These two bases had radio communication with American U-2 spy planes. The parliamentarians demanded that the government take measures to prevent Italian territory from being used to carry out actions similar to the American aggression against the Soviet Union on May 1st. They also demanded the removal of the American rocket bases that could bring great disaster to Italy.

    反对战争煽动者　反对美国在意大利设立基地
    意大利六十二个城市举行群众大会
    波伦亚警察残暴镇压打死十三人激起广大人民再次示威游行
    新华社25日讯　罗马消息：意大利共产党22日在意大利的六十二座城市里组织了反对战争煽动者和反对美国在意大利设立基地的群众大会。
    21日，在波伦亚举行的一次有几千人参加的群众大会被警察驱散了。警察用警棍打死了十三个人，参加这次集会的意大利共产党议员巴叶塔、波托内利和九名波伦亚的公民在大会被驱散以后被逮捕。他们被控告为“蔑视政府”、“侮辱外国首脑”和“反对当局”。波托内利被警察打伤，伤势严重，目前住在医院中。
    据“团结报”报道，巴叶塔等人的案件已被提交法庭。警察的这种袭击引起了群众的愤慨。22日，波伦亚全城举行了三十五次示威游行，抗议警察的挑衅。
    “团结报”还报道说，警察驱散了意大利共产党在伊莫拉城组织的一次大会，在这次大会上，当一位发言者代表伊莫拉的劳动人民表示支持波伦亚人民的斗争时，大会就被驱散了。但是，到会者在警察散开后，又在一家剧院中重新聚集起来，一致通过了抗议决议，尖锐地谴责了警察的行动。
    据意大利报纸报道，威尼托区的一批议员曾经就北大西洋公约组织在威尼托区建立的两个基地在议会提出质询。这两个基地和美国U—2间谍飞机保持过无线电联络。议员们要求政府采取措施，防止意大利领土被用来进行类似美国在5月1日对苏联所犯的侵略行动。他们还要求撤除可能给意大利带来极大灾难的美国火箭基地。
