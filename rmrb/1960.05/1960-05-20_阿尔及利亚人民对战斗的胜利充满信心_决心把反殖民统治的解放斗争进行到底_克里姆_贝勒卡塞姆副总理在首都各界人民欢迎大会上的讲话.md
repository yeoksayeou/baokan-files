Xinhua News Agency, 19th. Vice Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Krim Belkacem's speech at the mass rally: Mayor Peng Zhen, Your Excellencies, Marshal He Long, Marshal Chen Yi, Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends,
	The Algerian Government Delegation is particularly pleased to be able to meet solemnly with the friendly Chinese people. We would like to extend to the Chinese people, the Government of the People's Republic of China, and their brilliant leader, Chairman Mao Zedong, the deep sympathy and friendship of the Algerian people and government.
	Our delegation would also like to take this opportunity to once again express our warm and heartfelt gratitude to the esteemed Chinese people and the Government of the People's Republic of China for the warm and particularly friendly welcome they have extended to us during our visit to China.
	In every city our delegation has visited, whether in factories or in the countryside, we have been greeted everywhere with smiles and flowers. From ordinary people to leaders, from children to adults, we have felt the same deep sympathy and the same warm friendship.
	We know that this universally and powerfully expressed sympathy and friendship is not only sympathy and friendship for us ordinary people, but also sympathy and friendship for the heroic and suffering Algerian people. The Algerian people, who are 20,000 kilometers away from here, are bravely fighting for national independence and freedom.
	Although we are far apart, the struggle of the Algerian people resonates strongly in New China. This is by no means accidental, because the Chinese people themselves have waged more than a century of anti-colonialist struggle.
	China has also suffered imperialist occupation. But under the leadership of brilliant leaders, first the great Sun Yat-sen, and later the prestigious Mao Zedong, the Chinese people destroyed the backward feudal system and drove out the foreign invaders.
	Today, we are pleased to see in this hall the victory and vitality of the great People's Republic of China.
	During our visit to this country, we have seen a great and hardworking people who have demonstrated the heroic spirit in their economic construction that they showed not long ago in the struggle against the invaders. We have been deeply moved by the enthusiasm they have shown in their creative work. Therefore, it does not surprise us to see that New China, only ten years after its founding, is able to present to foreign visitors such magnificent achievements as this splendid building and the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation.
	China is changing its technologically backward face with giant strides and is moving towards a glorious goal. We have an obligation to confirm the effective efforts made by the great Chinese people in socialist construction, to confirm their desire for peace and their determination to deal with any aggressor.
	The Algerian people are proud of the sympathy and friendship of the people of such a country, who have demonstrated their courage and wisdom both in armed struggle and in peaceful construction.
	The destinies of our two countries are similar in many ways.
	Like China, Algeria was once the cradle of a glorious civilization. Like China, it was stained and invaded by European colonialism in the last century. After half a century, or rather, after a long period of armed resistance from 1830 to 1881, the Algerian people failed in the face of invaders who were superior in arms.
	But the flame of freedom and independence did not die out in the hearts of our people. Later, when conditions permitted, the Algerian people again took up arms and plunged into a decisive battle against French rule.
	For five and a half years, the Algerian people have been waging a surging struggle against an enemy who is superior in number and equipment. The French colonialists, with the political, financial, and material support of their Atlantic Pact allies, especially the American imperialist bloc, are waging a war of reconquest and genocide in Algeria. In retaliation for the heavy blows inflicted on them by the glorious National Liberation Army, the lawless French army has launched a frenzied offensive against unarmed civilians, against women, children, and the elderly.
	To date, nearly one million Algerian men and women have sacrificed themselves in this relentless battle against colonial rule.
	But although the struggle is arduous and sacrifices have been made, the morale of the Algerian people will not be diminished.
	Because of their rights and the correctness of their cause, the Algerian people are confident of a victorious outcome to the battle. They are determined to carry on the struggle to the end until they achieve national independence.
	In this struggle, the Algerian people are encouraged by the sympathy and support of all people who love justice and freedom.
	The fraternal Arab people give their full support to the struggle of the Algerian people.
	Similarly, the African people who are waging a struggle for liberation, as well as the Asian people who have recently been liberated from the colonial yoke and are fighting for the complete eradication of the remnants of colonial rule, firmly support the Algerian cause.
	Our people also know that the people of the socialist camp, like the people of Latin America and all democratic forces in the world, express their full solidarity with the Algerian people.
	Our people are proud of the sympathy and support given by the people of all countries on earth.
	The Algerian people are firmly opposed to French colonialism and the imperialist blocs that support it. However, the Algerian people understand that even in France, as in North America and other Western countries, there are forces of democracy, freedom, and justice that we should encourage.
	The policy of the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic is a policy of national liberation, a policy of peace and world cooperation. In short, our policy is the policy formulated at the historic Bandung Conference held in 1955.
	We believe that the solidarity of the Asian and African peoples is full of hope.
	If they are divided, they will become victims of imperialism; if they are united, they will be able to accelerate the liberation of the people of all countries still in chains and completely eradicate the remnants of foreign rule in Asia and Africa.
	The peoples of Asia and Africa are peoples with ancient cultures, but they are also young peoples. We believe that they will make great contributions to world peace and human civilization.
	The great People's Republic of China can be proud of its significant contribution to the Bandung Conference. Similarly, she can be proud of the outstanding example she has set in economic and social construction.
	The Algerian people, who are fighting for independence, particularly cherish the sympathy and support of the great and brave Chinese people.
	Our delegation will faithfully convey to the Algerian people the friendship gained during our visit to this hospitable country.
	We can say here that our people will thank their friends in times of difficulty tomorrow and express their gratitude to them.
	On behalf of fighting Algeria, on behalf of the Algerian people fighting for independence, please allow us to once again thank the great Chinese people for their warm reception and the sympathy they have shown for our cause.
	Long live the great People's Republic of China!

	Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Algerian people!

	Long live Asian-African solidarity!

	Long live world peace based on the independence of all nations!

    阿尔及利亚人民对战斗的胜利充满信心
    决心把反殖民统治的解放斗争进行到底
    克里姆·贝勒卡塞姆副总理在首都各界人民欢迎大会上的讲话
    新华社19日讯　克里姆·贝勒卡塞姆副总理兼外交部长在群众大会上的讲话彭真市长，阁下们，贺龙元帅、陈毅元帅，女士们，先生们，朋友们，
    阿尔及利亚政府代表团感到特别高兴能够和友好的中国人民隆重地会见。我们谨向中国人民，中华人民共和国政府和他们的英明领袖毛泽东主席转达阿尔及利亚人民和政府对他们的深厚同情和友谊。
    我们代表团还愿借此机会再一次向崇高的中国人民和中华人民共和国政府表示热忱的和衷心的谢意，感谢他们在我们访问中国期间所给予我们的热烈的和特别友好的欢迎。
    在我们代表团所访问过的各个城市中，无论是在工厂，还是在农村，人们到处都以微笑和鲜花来欢迎我们；无论是普通老百姓，还是领导人，无论是小孩，还是成年人，我们从他们身上感受到一种同样的深切的同情，和一种同样的热忱的友情。
    我们知道，这种普遍有力地表现出来的同情和友谊，不仅是对我们这些普通人的同情和友谊，而且是对英雄的和受难的阿尔及利亚人民的同情和友谊。阿尔及利亚人民距离这里有二万公里，他们正在为争取民族独立和自由而勇敢地进行斗争。
    虽然我们相距甚远，但是阿尔及利亚人民的斗争在新中国却有着强烈的反响。这纯粹不是偶然的。因为中国人民自己就进行过一百多年的反殖民主义的斗争。
    中国也曾经遭受过帝国主义的侵占。但是在英明的领袖，起先是伟大的孙中山，后来是享有威望的毛泽东的领导下，中国人民摧毁了落后的封建制度，并且赶走了外国侵略者。
    今天，我们在这个大厅里，高兴地看到伟大的中华人民共和国的胜利和它的生命力。
    当我们在这个国家访问期间，我们看到了一个伟大而勤劳的人民，他们在自己的经济建设中发扬了不久以前在反对侵略者的斗争中所表现的英雄气概。他们在创造性的劳动中所表现出来的热情使我们深受感动。所以，看到新中国在建国仅仅十年后的今天能够向外国访问者介绍诸如这个辉煌的大厦和武汉钢铁公司等宏伟的成就，并不使我们感到惊奇。
    中国以巨人的步伐改变着技术落后的面貌，并且朝着光荣的目标迈进。我们有义务来证实伟大的中国人民在社会主义建设中所付出的卓有成效的努力，证实他们的和平愿望以及他们对付任何侵略者的决心。
    阿尔及利亚人民为这样一个国家的人民的同情和友谊感到自豪。这个国家的人民，无论在武装斗争中、还是在和平建设中，都表现出他们的勇敢和智慧。
    我们两国的命运在很多方面都是很相似的。
    和中国一样，阿尔及利亚曾经是光辉的文明的摇篮。和中国一样，她在上一个世纪中曾经受到欧洲殖民主义的染指和侵略。经过了半个世纪，确切地说，经过了1830到1881年的长期的武装抵抗，阿尔及利亚人民在武装方面占优势的侵略者面前失败了。
    但是自由和独立的火焰并没有因此在我国人民的心中熄灭。以后，在条件许可的情况下，阿尔及利亚人民又拿起了武器，投入了一场反对法国统治的决定性的战斗。
    五年半以来，阿尔及利亚人民对在数量上和武器装备上占优势的敌人进行着汹涌澎湃的斗争。法国殖民主义者在其大西洋集团的同伙、尤其是美国帝国主义集团的政治、财政和物质的支持下，在阿尔及利亚进行着一场重新征服（阿尔及利亚）和灭绝人种的战争。为了对光荣的民族解放军所给予他们的严重打击进行报复，无法无天的法国军队向手无寸铁的平民、向妇女、儿童和老人展开了疯狂的进攻。
    迄今已有近一百万阿尔及利亚男女在这场反对殖民统治的无情的战斗中牺牲了。
    但是，尽管斗争是艰巨的，尽管作出了牺牲，阿尔及利亚人民的士气则是不会低落的。
    由于他们的权利和他们事业的正确性，阿尔及利亚人民对战斗的胜利结局是有信心的。他们决心把斗争进行到底，直到取得民族独立为止。
    在这场斗争中，一切爱好正义和自由的人民的同情和支持鼓舞着阿尔及利亚人民。
    兄弟般的阿拉伯人民给予阿尔及利亚人民的斗争以全力的支持。
    同样，正在进行解放斗争的非洲人民以及最近从殖民枷锁下解放出来并为彻底铲除殖民统治的残余而进行斗争的亚洲人民，都坚决地支持阿尔及利亚的事业。
    我国人民也知道，社会主义阵营各国人民，像拉丁美洲各国人民和全世界一切民主力量一样，表示完全声援阿尔及利亚人民。
    我国人民为地球上各国人民所给予的这种同情和支持而感到自豪。
    阿尔及利亚人民坚决反对法国殖民主义和支持法国殖民主义的帝国主义集团。然而阿尔及利亚人民懂得，即便在法国，也和在北美和其他西方国家一样，存在着我们应该予以鼓励的民主、自由和正义的力量。
    阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府的政策是一个民族解放的政策、一个和平的和世界合作的政策。简而言之，我国的政策就是在1955年举行的具有历史意义的万隆会议上制定的政策。
    我们相信亚非人民的团结是充满着希望的。
    如果他们四分五裂，他们就会成为帝国主义的牺牲者；如果他们团结一致，他们就将能够加速仍然处在枷锁下的各国人民的解放，和彻底铲除在亚洲和非洲的外国统治的残余。
    亚非各国人民是具有古老文化的人民，但是也是年青的人民。我们相信，他们将给世界和平和人类文明作出巨大的贡献。
    伟大的中华人民共和国可以为自己对万隆会议所作出的重大贡献而感到自豪。同样地，她也可以为自己在经济建设和社会建设中所作出的卓越的榜样而感到自豪。
    为争取独立而进行斗争的阿尔及利亚人民特别珍视伟大的和勇敢的中国人民的同情和支持。
    我们代表团将把在访问这个好客的国家期间所获得的友谊忠实地转达给阿尔及利亚人民。
    我们在这里可以这样说：我国人民将在明天感谢他们在艰难时期中的朋友，并且向他们表示谢意。
    请允许我们代表战斗的阿尔及利亚，代表为争取独立而斗争的阿尔及利亚人民，再一次感谢伟大的中国人民，感谢他们热情的接待和对我们事业所表示的同情。
    伟大的中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国人民和阿尔及利亚人民之间的友谊万岁！
    亚非团结万岁！
    在各国民族独立基础上的世界和平万岁！
