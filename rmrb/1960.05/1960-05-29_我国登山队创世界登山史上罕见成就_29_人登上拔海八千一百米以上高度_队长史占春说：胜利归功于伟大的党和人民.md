Xinhua News Agency, Everest, May 28th. Xinhua News Agency reporter Guo Chaoren reports from the Chinese Mountaineering Team's base camp at 5,120 meters below the summit of Mount Everest: During the ascent of the world's highest peak, Mount Everest, in addition to the three mountaineers who reached its summit, twenty-six other mountaineers have reached altitudes above 8,100 meters on Mount Everest on several occasions, creating a rare achievement in world mountaineering history.

Heights above 8,000 meters are considered by many experienced foreign mountaineers to be "extremely arduous and difficult tasks" due to the treacherous and unpredictable climate and extremely thin air. However, twenty-nine heroic Chinese mountaineers, along the north slope of Mount Everest, which foreign expeditions called "unclimbable," crossed the glacier zone stretching for more than ten kilometers, traversed the precipitous cliffs and rocks, braved the severe cold of minus 40 degrees Celsius and gales of force twelve or more, and endured the suffering of high-altitude hypoxia, victoriously climbing to altitudes above 8,100 meters. Among them, the longest mountaineering history is no more than five years, and the shortest participation in mountaineering activities is only a few months, but due to their diligence and hard work, they quickly mastered modern mountaineering techniques. During the ascent of Mount Everest, they were brave and tenacious, united and helpful, and finally became the victors in conquering heights above 8,000 meters.

Among these twenty-nine mountaineers, Wang Fuzhou, Gonbu (Tibetan), and Qu Yinhua reached the summit of Mount Everest at 8,882 meters above sea level, completing the feat of climbing the summit of Mount Everest from the north slope. The captain of the mountaineering team, Shi Zhanchun, and Wang Fengtong reached 8,600 meters above sea level during the third acclimatization march, finding a safe route for climbing the summit of Mount Everest. They did not participate in the fourth march to assault the main peak. Thirteen other mountaineers crossed the severely weathered and easily collapsing "Yellow Band," transporting supplies or establishing camps, reaching an altitude of 8,500 meters. These thirteen athletes are: Xu Jing, Liu Lianman, Duojia (Tibetan) (the above three were in the reserve group for assaulting the main peak, but due to weather changes, only reached 8,500 meters and did not participate in the assault on the main peak); Shi Jing, Laba Cairen (Tibetan), Wu Zongyue, Qunbei Jianzan (Tibetan), Sonam Dorje (Tibetan), Mima (Tibetan, soldier), Yundeng (Tibetan), Ciren (Tibetan), Mima Zhaxi (Tibetan), Quejia (Tibetan) (the above ten were responsible for transporting supplies).

A total of eleven people reached an altitude of 8,100 meters, namely: Zhang Junyan, Liu Dayi, Heng Hulin, Cheng Tianliang, Zhang Xiaolu, Ma Baochang, Dorje Bu (Tibetan), Xie Wucheng (Tibetan), Tamujun (Tibetan), Zhaxi (Tibetan), Mima (Tibetan, stonemason) (the above eleven were responsible for transporting supplies and establishing high-altitude camps).

Xinhua News Agency, Everest, May 28th. Xinhua News Agency reporter Guo Chaoren reports from the Chinese Mountaineering Team's base camp at 5,120 meters below the summit of Mount Everest:

The captain of the Chinese Mountaineering Team and mountaineering athlete, Shi Zhanchun, said today: The victory in climbing Mount Everest this time should first be attributed to the great Party and the great people of the motherland. The Party has given great encouragement and support to every step forward of this mountaineering team, and the people of the whole country, especially the people of Tibet, have given the mountaineering team direct assistance in many ways.

Shi Zhanchun said: Another important factor in achieving this victory is the mountaineers' brave, tenacious, and fearless will and the spirit of collectivism of unity and mutual assistance. Our mountaineers are full of confidence in the face of difficulties and are optimistic in the face of danger. Their slogans are: "Wherever the Party points, we will reach!" "We will never turn back until we reach the top of Mount Everest!"

In his speech, Shi Zhanchun focused on the great significance of this successful climb. He said: The significance of this climb cannot be summarized by the scope of sports. Following the Party's guiding principles for mountaineering, the mountaineering team conducted multi-faceted investigations and research on the natural conditions of the Mount Everest region during the mountaineering process.

Shi Zhanchun also said in his speech: This climb of Mount Everest is only the beginning of mountaineering activities for the young Chinese mountaineers. Our great motherland is a mountainous country, and most of the mountainous areas are still sparsely populated blank spots. The mountaineers must continue to work hard, plant the five-star red flag all over the peaks of the motherland, and contribute their strength to the construction of the motherland.

Shi Zhanchun finally said to the reporter: All the mountaineers dedicate this victory in climbing Mount Everest to all progressive and peace-loving people in the world, wishing that the strength of peace is as majestic and indestructible as Mount Everest, and wishing that the friendship between the people of the world is as pure and eternal as Mount Everest.

    我国登山队创世界登山史上罕见成就
    29人登上拔海八千一百米以上高度
    队长史占春说：胜利归功于伟大的党和人民
    新华社珠穆朗玛28日电　新华社记者郭超人自珠穆朗玛峰下拔海五千一百二十米的中国登山队大本营报道：在攀登世界第一高峰——珠穆朗玛峰的过程中，我国除了有三名登山运动员登到了它的顶峰外，还有二十六名登山运动员先后几次登上珠穆朗玛峰拔海八千一百米以上的高度，创造了在世界登山历史上罕见的成就。
    拔海八千米以上的高度，因为变幻无常的恶劣气候和极度稀薄的空气，许多有经验的外国登山家们都认为，攀登这个高度是“极其艰险和困难的任务”。但是，二十九名英雄的中国登山运动员们，却沿着被外国探险队称为“不可攀援”的珠穆朗玛峰北坡，越过绵延十几公里的冰川地带，跨过高悬万丈的陡壁巉岩，冒着摄氏零下四十度的严寒和十二级以上的暴风，忍受着高山缺氧的煎熬，胜利地攀上了拔海八千一百米以上的高度。他们当中，登山历史最长的不超过五年，最短的参加登山活动还只有几个月的时间，但由于他们的勤学苦练，很快就都掌握了现代化的登山技术。在攀登珠穆朗玛的过程中，他们勇敢顽强，团结互助，终于成为战胜拔海八千米以上高度的胜利者。
    在这二十九名登山运动员中，王富洲、贡布（藏族）、屈银花等三名运动员登上了拔海八千八百八十二米的珠穆朗玛峰顶峰，完成了从北坡攀登珠穆朗玛峰顶峰的创举。登山队队长史占春和王凤桐在第三次适应性行军时，到达了拔海八千六百米，为攀登珠穆朗玛顶峰找到了一条安全的路线。他们未参加第四次行军突击主峰。还有十三名登山运动员越过风化严重极易崩塌的“黄色地带”，运送物资或建立营地，达到了拔海八千五百米的高度。这十三名运动员是：许竞、刘连满、多加（藏族）（以上三人为突击主峰的预备组，但因天气变化，只到达八千五百米，未能参加突击主峰）；石竞、拉八才仁（藏族）邬宗岳、群贝坚赞（藏族）、索南多吉（藏族）、米马（藏族，战士）、云登（藏族）、茨仁（藏族）、米马扎西（藏族）、却加（藏族）（以上十人担任物资运输）。
    达到拔海八千一百米高度的共十一人，他们是：张俊岩、刘大义、衡虎林、成天亮、张小路、马保昌、多吉甫（藏族）、谢武成（藏族）、塔木君（藏族）、扎西（藏族）、米马（藏族，石匠）（以上十一人担任物资运输和建立高山营地）。
    据新华社珠穆朗玛28日电　新华社记者郭超人从珠穆朗玛峰下拔海五千一百二十米的中国登山队大本营报道：
    中国登山队队长、登山运动健将史占春今天说：取得这次攀登珠穆朗玛峰的胜利，首先应该归功于伟大的党和伟大的祖国人民。党对这支登山队前进的每一步，都给予了巨大的鼓舞和支持，全国人民特别是西藏人民更给予了登山队以多方面的直接的帮助。
    史占春说：取得这次胜利，另一个重要因素，是我们登山运动员们勇敢、顽强的大无畏意志和团结互助的集体主义精神。我们的登山运动员们在困难面前充满了自信，在危险面前照样乐观。他们的口号是：“党指向哪里，我们就到达哪里！”“不登上珠穆朗玛峰绝不回头！”
    史占春在谈话中着重谈到了这次登山成功的伟大意义。他说：这次登山意义决不是体育运动的范畴所能概括的。遵循着党对登山运动所指示的方针，在登山过程中，登山队对珠穆朗玛峰地区的自然情况进行了多方面的考察和研究。
    史占春在谈话中还说：这次攀登珠穆朗玛峰，对于年轻的中国登山运动员们来说，还只是他们登山活动的开始。我们伟大的祖国是一个多山的国家，大部分山区还是人迹罕见的空白点。登山运动员们要继续努力，把五星红旗插遍祖国的群峰，为祖国的建设事业贡献自己的力量。
    史占春最后向记者说：全体登山队员把这次攀登珠穆朗玛峰的胜利，献给世界一切进步和爱好和平的人们，愿和平的力量像珠穆朗玛峰一样雄伟坚强而不可摧毁，愿世界人民之间的友谊像珠穆朗玛峰一样纯洁和永世常存。（附图片）
