Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 1st: To celebrate International Labor Day, a grand military parade and mass march were held in Moscow's Red Square today.

Soviet party and state leaders Aristov, Brezhnev, Voroshilov, Ignatov, Kozlov, Mikoyan, Suslov, Furtseva, Khrushchev and others ascended the reviewing stand atop the Lenin Stalin Mausoleum, at which point the Red Square erupted in stormy applause. Also on the reviewing stand was the Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Grotewohl.

At exactly ten o'clock, Soviet Minister of Defense Marshal Malinovsky, accompanied by Parade Commander Marshal Moskalenko, inspected the armed forces arrayed on Red Square and the surrounding streets. Then, Malinovsky ascended the reviewing stand and delivered a holiday speech.

Malinovsky said that the Soviet people are celebrating May Day with pride in their motherland and with firm confidence in the correctness and ultimate victory of the great communist cause. He pointed out that the Soviet working people have made remarkable achievements in realizing the grand program of building communism. In the struggle for the victory of communism, the people of socialist countries and the Soviet people are advancing shoulder to shoulder. The world socialist system—an unbreakable fortress of peace and security—is growing stronger day by day.

Marshal Malinovsky said that hundreds of millions of people who were recently in the shackles of colonialism are now marching along the road of national revival!

Marshal Malinovsky emphasized: People all over the world are looking forward to the upcoming summit meeting to justly and quickly resolve the most pressing issues of the moment.

After pointing out the relaxation of the international situation, Malinovsky said that there are still some influential forces in some countries who are unwilling to accept this development of events, and they are frantically opposed to anything that helps to improve mutual understanding between the people of all countries and opposes the relaxation of tensions.

The Soviet Minister of Defense said that this "requires us to maintain a high degree of vigilance and maintain a high level of defense capabilities." He said that the Soviet people can rest assured that their armed forces are always ready to deliver a devastating rebuff to any aggressor who attempts to invade the great motherland.

Subsequently, the march-past began. Cadets from military academies and troops from various arms of the services marched past Red Square in succession.

The representatives of the newest armed force—the rocket forces—received a warm welcome as they passed through Red Square. Soviet-made rockets have ranges from tens of kilometers, hundreds of kilometers, to almost unlimited distances. At the forefront of the ranks were the famous "Katyushas" that once terrified the Hitlerite aggressors. The rockets passing through Red Square afterwards became larger and larger in caliber. Following the long-range rockets were automatic anti-aircraft rocket launchers, as well as rockets for striking targets deep in the enemy's rear, and ballistic rockets shaped like large cigars. At the end of the rocket forces were large long-range ballistic rockets.

After the military parade, the festive march of the working people began.

The festive parade lasted for more than two hours.

    莫斯科举行“五一”盛大阅兵和游行
    马利诺夫斯基说苏联武装部队准备给任何侵略者以毁灭性回击
    据新华社莫斯科1日电　为庆祝“五一”国际劳动节，莫斯科红场上今天举行了盛大的阅兵和群众游行。
    苏联党和国家的领导人阿里斯托夫、勃列日?夫、伏罗希洛夫、伊格纳托夫、科兹洛夫、米高扬、苏斯洛夫、福尔采娃、赫鲁晓夫等人登上列宁斯大林陵墓上的检阅台，这时红场上响起了暴风雨般的掌声。在检阅台上的还有德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥。
    十时整，苏联国防部长马利诺夫斯基元帅在阅兵总指挥莫斯卡连科元帅陪同下，检阅了排列在红场和附近街道上的武装部队。接着，马利诺夫斯基登上检阅台，发表了节日的演说。
    马利诺夫斯基说，苏联人民怀着对祖国的自豪感、怀着对伟大共产主义事业的正确性和最后胜利的坚定信心来庆祝“五一”节。他指出，苏联劳动人民在实现建设共产主义的宏伟纲领方面取得了卓越的成就。在争取共产主义胜利的斗争中，社会主义各国人民和苏联人民并肩前进。世界社会主义体系——和平与安全的牢不可破的堡垒——正在日益加强。
    马利诺夫斯基元帅说，不久前还处于殖民主义桎梏下的几亿人，现在正沿着民族复兴的道路前进！
    马利诺夫斯基元帅着重指出：全世界各国人民正在期待将要举行的最高级会议能够公正、迅速地解决当前最迫切的问题。
    马利诺夫斯基在指出国际局势出现缓和以后说，在一些国家中还有一些有影响的势力对事件的这种发展不甘心，他们疯狂地反对有助于改善各国人民的相互谅解、反对缓和紧张局势的一切因素。
    苏联国防部长说，这“就使得我们要保持高度的警惕，保持国防力量的高度水平”。他说，苏联人民可以安心的是，他们的武装部队时刻准备着给企图侵犯伟大祖国的任何侵略者以毁灭性的回击。
    随后，阅兵的分列式开始。军事学院的学员和各兵种部队相继列队通过红场。
    最新武装力量的代表——火箭部队在通过红场的时候，受到了人们的热烈欢迎。苏联制造的火箭射程从几十公里、几百公里一直到几乎无限远的距离。在队伍前列的是曾经使希特勒侵略者吓破肝胆的著名“卡秋莎”。随后通过红场的火箭口径越来越大。跟在射程很远的火箭后面的是自动高射火箭装置，以及用于击中敌人大后方目标的火箭、外形如像大雪茄烟一般的弹道火箭。火箭部队的最后是大型远程弹道火箭。
    阅兵完毕后，劳动人民的节日游行开始。
    节日游行历时两个多小时。
