On the 29th, crowds rejoiced on the vast grasslands of western Mongolia. Grassland herdsmen and farm workers welcomed Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to the grassland with immense joy. On this day, the Chinese guests lived among the enthusiastic grassland farmers and herdsmen as if they were in their own homes, feeling very亲切 and happy.

In the early morning, we followed Premier Zhou from Ulaanbaatar by plane to the Harahorin grassland in the Front Hangai Province of Mongolia. The plane flew over the Hangai Mountains, reaching the Harahorin grassland in just over an hour. Here was a large expanse of flat land, with the Orkhon River winding through the grassland like a swirling silver ribbon. Some large and small canals meandered through the cultivated land, these being the first irrigation canals currently under construction at the Harahorin farm, and in Mongolia as a whole.

The plane landed. The crowd erupted in cheers. Herdsmen who had ridden horses from dozens of miles away waved Chinese and Mongolian national flags and colorful flags in their hands. All the staff and their families of the farm, the Chinese employees working here, and the Soviet and Hungarian experts and their families came to welcome Premier Zhou. Almost all of the more than two thousand people living on the Harahorin grassland came out, holding red flags and freshly picked flowers from the mountains. Premier Zhou Enlai and Chairman Tsedenbal walked through the jubilant crowd, constantly waving to the welcoming people.

Farm Director Purbu warmly entertained Premier Zhou and introduced him to the farm's development. The farm is almost four years old since its establishment. The development over the past four years has been remarkable. Large tracts of land have been reclaimed and have yielded rich harvests. This year, 15,000 hectares of grain have been sown, more than four times the amount in 1957. The farm has almost completely achieved mechanized production, with more than seventy tractors, more than sixty combine harvesters, and more than twenty transport vehicles. The director said: "We have many Chinese experts working with us on our farm. They work very hard and help us a lot." Premier Zhou said: "Your farm is developing very quickly and your work is very good. I wish you new achievements."

Premier Zhou Enlai and Chairman Tsedenbal visited the newly built canal. Here, a dam more than 180 meters long has been built on the Orkhon River, along with an intake gate and a flushing gate.

The river water, with its rolling white waves, is drawn from the intake gate into the canal. The water stored in the canal will flow into the wide land,预传ing good news of even greater agricultural harvests.

Premier Zhou Enlai had a long and cordial conversation with Chinese engineers and Mongolian water conservancy representatives. Premier Zhou lingered at the sluice gate for a long time, asking with concern about the water flow rate, the depth of the canal, and other specific issues. Premier Zhou encouraged the more than two thousand Chinese employees working here to work hard and strive to complete this massive water conservancy project ahead of schedule, even better and faster.

Mongolian water conservancy representative Davaasuren told Premier Zhou that he had interned at the Yellow River irrigation canal in China and visited the Sanmenxia Dam and the Ming Tombs Reservoir. Chairman Tsedenbal asked the Chinese engineers: "Did our water conservancy representative complete his task? Did he help you?" The Chinese engineers immediately replied: "He helped a lot!" Chairman Tsedenbal then said: "You must help him learn the technology well!" The Chinese engineers replied: "We are learning from each other."

The Harahorin irrigation project, built with Chinese assistance, is located on the right bank of the Orkhon River and is 370 kilometers long. The main canal has three branch canals, twenty-nine bucket canals, and one hundred forty-eight farm canals. There is also a hydroelectric power station with a capacity of more than 500 kilowatts. Once completed, it can irrigate more than 8,000 hectares of farmland. Premier Zhou Enlai, Chairman Tsedenbal, and others stood on the dam and looked out over the entire project for a long time. Chairman Tsedenbal watched the Orkhon River water flowing in the newly built canal and couldn't help but give a thumbs up and say to the Chinese engineers in Chinese: "Very good, thank you!"

After visiting the hydroelectric power station under construction, Premier Zhou Enlai and Chairman Tsedenbal attended a grand welcoming meeting held by the farm.

This grand gathering used the vast grassland as its venue and the surrounding high mountains as its giant screen. The colorful costumes of the welcoming masses, the portraits of Zhou Enlai and Tsedenbal they held, and the waving flowers and colorful flags formed a bright and magnificent wreath, surrounding the newly built rostrum. When Premier Zhou Enlai and Chairman Tsedenbal ascended the rostrum, the sun shone brightly, complementing the colorful welcoming crowds, making for a beautiful and moving scene.

At this grand gathering, guests and hosts spoke one after another. From Chairman Tsedenbal to the provincial party secretary and the captain of the farm's famous "Socialist Labor Team," their speeches were filled with亲切 brotherly feelings. They called the Harahorin farm a farm that symbolizes Mongolian-Chinese friendship. Premier Zhou Enlai said that this grand welcoming meeting was a combination of Chinese-Mongolian friendship, and the Harahorin farm was a combination of the labor of the Chinese and Mongolian people. He raised his arm and shouted: Long live Chinese-Mongolian friendship and friendly mutual assistance and cooperation! These friendly words sparked waves of cheers, one after another. These waves shook the grassland, and the grassland was filled with joy.

The feeling of friendship not only flowed here. When Premier Zhou Enlai, accompanied by Chairman Tsedenbal, visited the Hujilt Sanatorium and the Animal Husbandry Machine Station, equally touching scenes appeared there. Thousands of herdsmen and sanatorium staff gathered at the airport to welcome Premier Zhou. As soon as Premier Zhou arrived, a wave of joy was set off.

The Hujilt Sanatorium uses natural mineral water to establish many bathrooms. According to legend, many years ago, this place was haunted by wild animals, and hunters often came to hunt. Once, an old hunter saw a wounded, limping deer by the mountain gully opposite the sanatorium, soaking its wound in the water ditch. The hunter refused to shoot it. Two days later, the hunter came to the mountain again, and the wounded deer leaped up and ran away. The old man suffered from rheumatism, and he also went to bathe in the water. Soon, he was cured. This news spread throughout the grassland, and herdsmen often went to bathe in this magical spring. Now, the Mongolian government has built a beautiful sanatorium in this scenic area, and thousands of workers come to recuperate every year.

On this day, Premier Zhou visited the sanatorium's bathrooms, medical rooms, and other facilities. Then, he came to a beautiful small auditorium to enjoy the song and dance performances of the sanatorium's staff and patients. A Chinese worker receiving treatment here sang a Mongolian folk song in Mongolian, and a Mongolian patient sang "The East is Red" in Chinese, which was especially unforgettable. Finally, Premier Zhou Enlai took the stage, thanked them for their performance, and presented Mao Zedong commemorative badges to each performer.

After Premier Zhou visited the Animal Husbandry Machine Station, it was already past six o'clock in the afternoon. When Premier Zhou was about to return to Ulaanbaatar by plane, the enthusiastic people once again gathered at the airport to cheer and see him off, repeatedly cheering for Premier Zhou.

The unrestrained enthusiasm and endless affection of the Mongolian grassland herdsmen will be forever remembered in the hearts of the Chinese guests!

    欢腾的草原
    新华社记者　彭逢烨　于民生
    29日，在蒙古西部辽阔的草原上，人群欢腾。草原牧民、农牧场职工以万分喜悦的心情，迎接周恩来总理来到草原参观访问。这一天，中国客人一直生活在热情洋溢的草原农牧民中间，就好像在自己的家里一样，感到十分亲切和愉快。
    清晨，我们跟随周总理从乌兰巴托乘飞机前往蒙古前杭爱省哈拉和林草原。飞机在杭爱山脉上空飞行，一个多钟头就到达哈拉和林草原上空。这里有一大片平整的土地，鄂尔浑河水，曲曲弯弯地盘行在草原中间，像一条回旋着的银带。一些大、小不等的渠道，在耕地中纵横蜿蜒，这就是哈拉和林农牧场正在兴修的、也是蒙古目前的第一个水利灌溉渠道。
    飞机着陆了。人群顿时欢腾起来。从几十里外骑马赶来的牧民们，在马上挥动着手里的中、蒙两国国旗和彩旗，农牧场全体职工和他们的家属、在这里建设的中国员工以及苏联、匈牙利的专家和他们的家属都来欢迎周总理。住在哈拉和林草原上的两千多人几乎全都出来了，人们举着红旗，拿着刚从山上采摘来的盛开的鲜花。周恩来总理和泽登巴尔主席从欢腾的人群夹道中走过，不断地向欢迎人群挥手致意。
    农牧场场长普尔布盛情招待周总理，他向周总理介绍了农牧场的发展情况。农牧场建场到现在快满四年了。四年来的发展是惊人的。大片土地被开垦出来了，而且获得了丰收。今年已经播种了一万五千公顷谷物，比1957年增加到四倍以上。农牧场几乎完全实现了机械生产，现有拖拉机七十多台，收割联合机六十多台，运输汽车二十多辆。厂长说：“在我们场里有许多中国专家和我们一起工作，他们工作很努力，对我们帮助很大。”周总理说：“你们的农牧场发展很快，工作很好，祝你们取得新的成就。”
    周恩来总理和泽登巴尔主席来到新建的渠道参观。就在这里，在鄂尔浑河上已经修筑了一个一百八十多米长的水坝，修建了进水闸和冲刷闸。
    河水翻滚着白浪，从进水闸引到渠道，蓄在渠道里的水将流到宽阔的土地里，为更大的农业丰收预传着喜讯。
    周恩来总理同中国工程师和蒙古水利代表作了长时间的亲切谈话。周总理在水闸上逗留了很久，关切地问到水的流速、渠道的深浅和其他具体问题。周总理勉励在这里工作的两千多名中国员工好好工作，争取更好更快地提前完成这个巨大的水利工程。
    蒙古水利代表达瓦苏伦告诉周总理，他曾经到中国的引黄灌渠实习、参观访问过三门峡水坝和十三陵水库。泽登巴尔主席问中国工程师：“我们的水利代表是否完成了任务，对你们有没有帮助？”中国工程师立刻回答说：“帮助很大！”泽登巴尔主席又说：“你们要帮助他学好技术！”中国工程师回答说：“我们是相互学习。”
    由中国帮助建设的哈拉和林水利灌溉工程位于鄂尔浑河右岸，全长三百七十公里。在总干渠下设三条支渠，二十九条斗渠，一百四十八条农渠，另设有一座五百多瓩的水力发电站，建成以后，可以灌溉八千多公顷农田。周恩来总理和泽登巴尔主席等站在水坝上长时间地凭栏眺望工程的全景。泽登巴尔主席看着鄂尔浑河水在新建的渠道中奔流，禁不住伸出大拇指用中国话对中国工程师说：“很好，感谢你们！”
    在参观了正在建设的水力发电站以后，周恩来总理、泽登巴尔主席一起出席农牧场举行的盛大欢迎会。
    这个盛会以广阔的草原为会场，以环抱的高山为巨屏，欢迎群众的多彩服装、他们举着的周恩来和泽登巴尔的画像、挥动着的鲜花和五颜六色的旗帜，组成了一个鲜艳瑰丽的大花环，环绕在新搭起的主席台四周。周恩来总理和泽登巴尔主席登上主席台的时候，太阳金光四射，同彩色缤纷的欢迎群众队伍交相辉映，绚丽动人。
    在这盛大的集会上，宾主一个个相继讲话。从泽登巴尔主席到省委书记和农牧场著名的“社会主义劳动队”队长，他们的讲话中充满了亲切的兄弟情谊，他们把哈拉和林农牧场称为象征蒙中友谊的农牧场。周恩来总理说，这个盛大的欢迎会是中蒙友谊的结合，哈拉和林农牧场就是中蒙人民劳动的结合。他振臂高呼：中蒙友谊和友好互助合作万岁！这些友谊的话语，引起了一阵高过一阵的欢呼声浪。这声浪震荡着草原，草原上一片欢乐。
    友谊的情感不仅在这里奔流，当周恩来总理由泽登巴尔主席陪同，到胡吉尔特疗养院和畜牧业机器站参观访问的时候，那里同样出现了极为感人的场面。几千名牧民和疗养人员齐集在机场欢迎周总理，周总理一到那里，那里就掀起了欢乐的浪潮。
    胡吉尔特疗养院利用天然的矿泉水建立了许多浴室。相传在很多年以前，这里是野兽出没的地方，猎人们常来打猎。有一位老猎人在一次打猎时，在疗养院对面的山沟旁，看到一只受伤的跛腿鹿，把伤口浸在水沟里，猎人不肯打它，过了两天，猎人再到山边来，受伤的鹿跃起逃跑了。老人患风湿病，他也到水里洗澡，不久，病就痊愈了。这消息传遍了草原，牧民们便常常到这神奇的泉水中洗浴。现在，蒙古政府在这个风景幽美的地区，修建了漂亮的疗养院，每年有几千名职工来疗养。
    这天，周总理参观了疗养院的浴室、医疗室等各种设备。然后来到一个美丽的小礼堂，欣赏疗养院职工和疗养员们的歌舞演出，在这里疗养的一位中国工人用蒙古语演唱的蒙古民歌和蒙古疗养员用中文演唱的“东方红”，特别使人难忘。最后，周恩来总理登上舞台，感谢他们的演出，并把毛泽东纪念章分别赠给每一个演员。
    周总理在参观了畜牧业机器站以后，已经是下午六点多钟了。当周总理要乘飞机返回乌兰巴托的时候，热情的人们又一次聚集在机场上夹道欢送，一再向周总理欢呼。
    蒙古草原牧民奔放的热情和绵绵无尽的情谊，将永记在中国客人的心头！
