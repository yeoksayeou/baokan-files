Xinhua News Agency, 7th Dispatch from Istanbul: The martial law command in Istanbul, Turkey's largest city, confiscated all morning newspapers in the city on the morning of May 6th. The authorities offered no reason for this action. However, several newspapers that had already been sold before the confiscation carried a communique from the Turkish Interior Ministry regarding a large-scale demonstration held in Ankara on the evening of May 5th.

    The communique stated that while the streets were crowded, "two or three hundred young students and idlers" staged a demonstration on Atatürk Avenue in the capital, and pre-arranged security forces stopped the demonstration.

    However, previous reports had stated that approximately four thousand students, office workers, and civil servants participated in the demonstration. They stopped Prime Minister Menderes' car three times, demanding his resignation.

    Hours after the newspapers were confiscated, a second edition was published, and in the place where the Interior Ministry's announcement had originally appeared, there was instead a news item stating that Turkish President Bayar and Prime Minister Menderes had been "welcomed" by the broad masses. This news item portrayed the several thousand demonstrators as "a handful of hostile elements."

Xinhua News Agency, 7th Dispatch from Ankara: Turkish Foreign Minister Zorlu admitted at a press conference in Ankara on May 6th that the Menderes fascist government had arrested approximately 1,500 people in recent days in the barbaric suppression of popular demonstrations. He also said that military tribunals would "sentence" these arrested individuals.

    Zorlu also admitted that many hotel workers had participated in anti-government demonstrations and had been arrested. Zorlu threatened to further intensify the repression.

    According to information from various sources, the number of arrests admitted by Zorlu is clearly greatly reduced. It is reported that thousands of people are on trial throughout Turkey.

    土耳其政府加紧镇压活动
    外交部长承认近几天来已逮捕一千多人
    伊斯坦布尔当局没收报纸封锁示威消息
    据新华社7日讯　伊斯坦布尔消息：土耳其最大城市伊斯坦布尔的戒严司令部6日上午没收了这个城市所有的晨报。官方没有提供采取这个行动的理由。但是在没收前已经卖出去的几份报纸上刊载了土耳其内政部关于5月5日晚上在安卡拉举行大规模示威的公报。
    这项公报说，当街上很拥挤的时候，“二三百名青年学生和闲人”在首都的阿塔图克大街上举行示威，事先设下的保安部队制止了这次示威。
    但是，前些时候所有的报道都说，大约有四千名学生、机关职员和公务人员参加了这次示威。他们三次制止了曼德列斯总理的汽车，要求他辞职。
    在报纸被没收的几小时以后，第二版又出版了，在原来登载内政部公告的地方居然出现了这样一则消息：土耳其总统拜亚尔和曼德列斯总理受到广大群众的“欢迎”。这则消息把好几千的示威者说成是“一小撮敌对分子”。
    据新华社7日讯　安卡拉消息：土耳其外交部长佐鲁6日在安卡拉举行的记者招待会上承认，近几天来曼德列斯法西斯政府在野蛮镇压人民示威中，逮捕了约有一千五百人。他还说，军事法庭要对这些被捕者“判刑”。
    佐鲁还承认，曾有许多旅馆业工人参加了反政府的示威，而且遭到逮捕。佐鲁威胁说还要进一步加紧镇压活动。
    据各方面透露的情况，佐鲁承认的逮捕人数显然是大大缩小了的。据报道：土耳其全国各地有几千人正在受审。
