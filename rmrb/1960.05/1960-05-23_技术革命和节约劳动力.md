Technical innovation and technical revolution's primary purpose is to effectively increase labor productivity, and effectively save living labor and materialized labor. The growth of labor productivity is the saving of living labor (labor force) and materialized labor (raw materials, machinery, and equipment). This is a theoretical issue in correctly implementing the general line of socialist construction. Comrade Mao Zedong once pointed out: “Any socialist economic undertaking must pay attention to making the fullest possible use of manpower and equipment, improving labor organization, improving business management, increasing labor productivity, and saving all possible manpower and material resources…” The technical revolution provides enormous possibilities for maximizing the saving of living labor. When Anhui Province formulated its increased production plan at the beginning of this year, some factories and mines requested increases in personnel. After the launch of the mass technical revolution movement, not only was there no increase in personnel in the first quarter, but the province also saved more than 120,000 workers. From increasing production requiring increased personnel to increasing production while decreasing personnel, this is a major change in labor organization brought about by the technical revolution.

The technical revolution has brought about a tremendous development of productive forces and will inevitably break through some links in the original relations of production. The task of leaders is to adjust these relations of production in a timely manner to adapt them to the needs of the productive forces and promote the development of the productive forces. Production departments of enterprises should promptly and appropriately adjust labor organization on the basis of technical innovations, proceeding from reality, and transferring surplus labor from work posts that are no longer needed. This matter is directly related to the consolidation of the innovation achievements of enterprises. What happened in Wuhu City, Anhui Province, best illustrates this point. Last year, some steel plants in Wuhu used crushers to replace manual ore crushing, but at that time, because the saved labor force was not transferred, once the crusher malfunctioned, manual operation was resumed. As a result, manpower was not saved, and the achievements of the technical revolution were not consolidated. This year, all factories accepted last year’s lessons, and based on the reform of equipment technology, immediately transferred more than 8,000 surplus workers. Once the machines malfunctioned, the workers immediately repaired them, greatly consolidating the achievements of the innovation. It can be seen that there is a relationship of mutual connection and mutual promotion between technical revolution and saving labor. We must be good at constantly and effectively combining technical revolution and the adjustment of production relations, and strive to "innovate, rectify, determine staffing levels, transfer, and arrange all at the same time." All labor that can be saved should be resolutely and promptly transferred, and a new production order should be established immediately to eliminate the possibility of "going backward." Emphasizing the timely adjustment of labor organization here does not mean that personnel should be transferred immediately after an innovation, but rather that attention should be paid to the adjustment of the labor force on the basis of rectification and consolidation. Otherwise, transferring people too early will also fail to stabilize the existing achievements of the technical revolution.

From the perspective of enterprise management, after the emergence and promotion of new production technologies, enterprises should adapt to the new situation of the technical revolution, improve staffing quotas, strive to reach the advanced national staffing level, and promote the development of the technical revolution. Of course, staffing quotas are not static. In the technical revolution, the staffing quotas of enterprises must not only be "fixed" but also "changed." Everything often changes within stability, and stabilizes within change, constantly improving with both stability and change. The staffing quotas we require are based on various labor-saving factors in a certain period to consider the number of employees, mobilize the masses to strive to reach advanced staffing standards, so as to carry out the technical revolution more deeply. We must use the spirit of revolution to formulate advanced staffing standards, and strive to break through these staffing standards and save more labor.

Saving labor does not mean that we have too much labor and cannot use it. On the contrary, due to the tremendous development of various construction undertakings, the existing labor force is not very abundant. In our country, every worker is precious, and the workers saved from factories and enterprises generally have a higher level of political awareness and a certain level of technical and cultural knowledge, so more attention should be paid to their rational use. The saved labor force should first be used to support the needs of newly built and expanded enterprises; secondly, it can be used to engage in diversified operations, run "satellite factories" and establish raw material bases, so that single-production enterprises can develop into comprehensive enterprises; a group of veteran skilled workers can also be transferred to form technical revolution shock brigades; and a group of skilled workers can be sent to the countryside to help rural areas set up small-scale indigenous and foreign enterprises, run training classes, impart technology, and support the technical transformation of people's communes. In addition, workers who meet the conditions should be selected to go to technical schools or technical training classes for further study. In short, the principle for using the labor force saved by the technical revolution should be to use it in places where people are most needed and where their enthusiasm can be best utilized.

### 技术革命和节约劳动力

    技术革命和节约劳动力
    技术革新和技术革命的主要目的，在于有效地提高劳动生产率，有效地节约活的劳动和物化劳动。劳动生产率的增长，也就是活的劳动（劳动力）和物化劳动（原材料、机器设备等）的节约。这是正确贯彻社会主义建设总路线的一个理论性问题。毛泽东同志曾经指出：“任何社会主义的经济事业，必须注意尽可能充分地利用人力和设备，尽可能改善劳动组织、改善经营管理和提高劳动生产率，节约一切可能节约的人力和物力……。”技术革命为最大限度地节约活的劳动提供了巨大的可能性。安徽省今年年初订增产计划时，一些厂矿纷纷提出增人的要求，当全民性的技术革命运动开展以后，第一季度不但没有增加人员，全省还节约劳动力十二万多人。从增产要增人，到增产又减人，这是技术革命在劳动组织方面引起的一大变化。
    技术革命带来了生产力的巨大发展，必然要突破原来的生产关系的某些环节，领导者的任务就在于及时调整这些生产关系使其适应于生产力的需要，并推动生产力的发展。企业生产部门在技术革新的基础上要及时地适当调整劳动组织，从实际出发，把多余的劳动力从不再需要的工作岗位上抽调出来，这一件事，直接关系到巩固企业的革新成果问题。安徽省芜湖市发生的事情最能说明这个问题。去年，芜湖有的钢铁厂曾经采用破碎机代替人力破碎矿石，但当时因为没有把节约的劳动力抽调出来，破碎机一有故障，便又恢复到手工操作，结果是人力没有节约，技术革命的成果也没有得到巩固。今年，各厂接受去年的教训，根据设备技术的改革情况，立即把节余的八千多人抽调出来。一旦机器发生故障，工人们就立即修理，结果是大大地巩固了革新成果。可见技术革命和节约劳动力之间，存在着相互关连、相互促进的关系。我们要善于把技术革命和调整生产关系经常地很好地结合起来，努力作到“边革新、边整顿、边定员、边抽调、边安排”。凡是确实可以节约出来的劳动力，就坚决地、及时地抽出来，并立即建立新的生产秩序，消除“走回头路”的可能。这里强调及时调整劳动组织，并不是说一有革新就立即调动人员，而是要在整顿巩固的基础上注意劳动力的调整。否则，过早地调出人来，同样也不能稳定已有的技术革命的成果。
    从企业管理来看，新的生产技术出现和推广以后，各企业应该适应技术革命的新形势，改进编制定员，争取达到全国先进的定员水平，促进技术革命的发展。当然，编制定员并不是一成不变的，在技术革命中，企业的编制定员不仅要“定”，而且要“变”。一切事情，常常是变中有定，定中有变，又定又变，不断提高的。我们所要求的编制定员，是依据一定时期各种节约人力的因素，来考虑定员人数，发动群众争取达到先进的定员标准，以便更深入地进行技术革命。我们要用革命的精神来制定先进的定员标准，并且力争突破这个定员标准，节约更多的劳动力。
    节约劳动力，并不是说我们的劳动力太多了，用不了了，恰恰相反，由于各项建设事业的巨大发展，现有的劳动力还并不是很充裕的。在我们国家里，每个劳动力都是宝贵的，而从工厂企业中节约出的劳动力，他们一般具有较高的政治觉悟，一定的技术文化水平，那就更应当注意合理使用。节约出的劳动力首先应当用来支援新建、扩建企业的需要；其次，可以用来搞多种经营办“卫星厂”和建立原料基地，使单一生产的企业向综合性企业发展；还可以抽调一部分老技术工人组成技术革命突击队；以及输送一批技术工人到农村，帮助农村兴办小土群、小洋群，开办训练班，传授技术，支援人民公社的技术改造。另外，选择条件适合的工人到技术学校或者到技术训练班去深造。总之，对于技术革命节约出来的劳动力的使用问题应该以用到那些最需要人，而又最能发挥他们的积极性的场所为原则。
