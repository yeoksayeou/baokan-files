Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 29th -- The "Fuan" ship, one of the fourth group of ships dispatched by the Chinese government to transport overseas Chinese back to the country, has passed through Jakarta and is en route to Bali to bring back overseas Chinese who are persecuted and impoverished there.

More than 250 persecuted overseas Chinese residing in the villages of Benkinihan, Kampung Sari, and Minjak in Wanli County, Bali, will board this ship to return to the country. All of these people are impoverished farmers who make a living by growing coffee. The land they cultivate was given to their ancestors by the local king in 1860 because they got along well with the local people and worked diligently. For over a hundred years, they have worked hard to reclaim the wasteland. In February 1958, these lands, renowned for coffee cultivation, were suddenly "reclaimed" unreasonably by the local authorities, depriving them of their only means of livelihood and leaving them in a state of poverty and illness.

At that time, the overseas Chinese residing in these coffee-growing villages requested the authorities to compensate them for the "reclaimed" land and to send them back to China. It was not until April 1958 that the local government verbally informed them that it agreed to immediately compensate those who were willing to return to China, and that the coffee planted that year would also be given to them. It also agreed that the compensation for those who were willing to stay would be paid in full within five years. Most of the overseas Chinese there prepared their passports to return to the country. However, the authorities have consistently failed to honor their promises and have taken away all the coffee they harvested in 1958 and 1959. Only after negotiations did the overseas Chinese receive an amount equivalent to 30% of the annual coffee production value. As a result, the overseas Chinese farmers there are on the verge of starvation. They have to rely on wild vegetables and coarse grains for sustenance. They live in extreme poverty.

Although they received some compensation in February of this year, the amount was meager and not even enough for them to buy tickets to return home. Just as they felt trapped in a desperate situation, they heard the news that their motherland had sent ships to bring them back home. They were all very excited, and the entire village decided to return to the country and dedicate their coffee-growing skills to serving the motherland. However, according to recent news arriving here, they have encountered new difficulties as they prepare to return home. The local tax collectors have imposed very strict restrictions on their meager belongings, preventing them from taking back their only possessions. The overseas Chinese there now demand that the authorities treat them reasonably and allow them to smoothly board the ships sent by their motherland to return home.

    巴厘岛华侨受到当局迫害处境困难
    我国已派轮船前往接运
    新华社雅加达29日电　中国政府派遣接运华侨回国的第四批船只之一“福安号”已经经由雅加达前往巴厘岛，以便把那里受到迫害的和贫困的华侨接运回国。
    居住在巴厘岛万利县本京尼汉、甘邦沙里和明贾克等村庄的二百五十多名受到迫害的华侨将搭乘这艘轮船回国。所有这些人都是靠种植咖啡为生的贫苦农民。他们所耕种的土地是当地国王在1860年给予他们的祖先的，他们获得这些土地是因为他们和当地人民相处得很好，并且进行了辛勤的劳动。在过去一百多年中，他们付出了艰巨的劳动开垦了荒地。在1958年2月，以种植咖啡而负有盛誉的这些土地突然被地方当局无理“收回”，这样就使他们丧失了唯一的谋生手段，并且使他们处于贫病交迫的境地。
    当时，居住在这些种植咖啡的村庄里的华侨要求当局对他们被“收回”的土地给予赔偿，并且遣送他们回国。直到1958年4月，当地政府才口头上通知他们说，它同意立即对那些愿意回中国的人进行赔偿，那一年所种的咖啡也将给他们。它还同意，那些愿意留在那里的人的赔偿费将在五年内付清。那里的大多数华侨准备了护照以便回国。但是，当局一直不履行诺言，并且还把他们1958年和1959年收割的咖啡全部拿走。只是在经过交涉以后，华侨才获得相当于全年咖啡产值30％的款项。因此，那里的华侨农民处于饥饿的边缘。他们不得不依靠野菜和粗谷为生。他们过着非常贫困的生活。
    虽然他们在今年2月得到了一些赔偿费，但是为数甚微，甚至不足以供他们购买船票回国。正当他们感到陷于绝境的时候，他们听到消息说，祖国已经派遣船只接运他们回国。他们都很激动，全体村民都决定回国，并且决定把他们种植咖啡的技能为祖国服务。但是，据最近到达这里的消息说，当他们作回国的准备的时候，他们遇到了新的困难。当地的税收官对他们少量的衣物作了非常严格的限制。这样他们就不能带回仅有的财物。那里的华侨现在要求当局合理地对待他们，让他们顺利地搭乘他们祖国政府派来的船只回国。
