Nazarian, director of the bank's planning and economics department, said at the meeting that the provocative actions of the American ruling group once again prove that they are not seeking a way to ease international tensions, but are using empty talk to confuse the people of the world.

　　Zeynalov, an oil worker in Azerbaijan, expressed his opinion in a newspaper on the 18th, saying that the Soviet government gave the anti-Soviet provocateurs the deserved counterattack, and our oil workers warmly support the government's policy of defending peace.
