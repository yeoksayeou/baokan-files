    Righteous Condemnation
    By Our Correspondent
    The Fifth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union was held in the Kremlin Conference Hall for three days. During these three days, while unanimously supporting and cheering the government's measures to further improve the people's living standards, all the representatives expressed righteous anger and stern condemnation of the US imperialism’s persistence in the Cold War and the arms race, and even its direct provocations against the Soviet Union.
    The scene of the representatives' indignation in the hall when Comrade Khrushchev exposed the US aircraft's violation of the Soviet Union was something this reporter had never encountered in the Supreme Soviet meetings over the years.
    When Comrade Khrushchev talked about the US aircraft's intrusion into Soviet airspace on May Day, he said that the Soviet government decided that, no matter what, the enemy plane must be shot down, "This task has been accomplished - the plane has been shot down!" At this time, the representatives were immediately excited, and thunderous applause resounded throughout the hall, with representatives shouting: "Well done!" "Correct!" "The invaders are shameless!"
    When Comrade Khrushchev mentioned that the plane was sent by the United States, a representative shouted angrily from below the stage: "How can this be linked to Eisenhower's hypocritical speeches? This is downright robbery!"
    After the report, at the afternoon meeting that day, the executive chairman of the meeting told the representatives that the conference had received telegrams from the working people across the Soviet Union, stating that the Soviet people unanimously supported the government's measures to severely punish the invaders and expressed extreme anger at the activities of the American aggressors. A veteran from Kiev said in a telegram: "Thank you, dear Party! For giving the warmongers the most timely blow! Hurrah!"
    What could be more infuriating than the shameless invasion of one's own country by imperialist bandits? During the three-day meeting, we saw every representative walk onto the podium with anger, denouncing the US imperialism's banditry in invading the Soviet Union. At the same time, we saw every representative express a firm determination to defend the security of the motherland and an unparalleled confidence in destroying all invaders.
    Listen to the speech of Soviet Marshal Grechko! He said that the US military aircraft's intrusion into the Soviet Union was a completely shameful and utter act of banditry. This fact once again exposed the imperialists as irreconcilable enemies of peace and security for the people of all countries. The US military aircraft's bandit-like intrusion into Soviet airspace was an attempt to reconnoiter the Soviet Union's defense capabilities, but the provocation finally went bankrupt. The Soviet Union's first missile shot down the US aircraft that intruded into the Soviet Union, letting those war adventurers and provocateurs know that the Soviet Union has sufficient arms to deal with the invaders. The Soviet army is vigilantly monitoring the actions of the aggressive forces and will never let go of any of their provocative actions.
    Representative Struyev raised the question, saying that the US military aircraft intruded into the Soviet Union when Eisenhower was about to visit the Soviet Union. The Soviet people do not understand, according to the rules of the United States, how should this be explained?
    Belarusian Representative Kiselev righteously questioned, "Did Eisenhower know about this invasion? Did the Pentagon, these unscrupulous adventurers, carry out this invasion without Eisenhower's consent?"
    Locomotive driver instructor Sorkin pointed out to people during the meeting break that this invasion shows what the American politicians are actually doing while constantly shouting for peace. Sorkin said, "My comrades are asking Comrade Khrushchev to directly tell Eisenhower when they meet, 'This is not acceptable!'"
    Comrade Khrushchev's concluding remarks at the Supreme Soviet meeting on the 7th made the representatives feel even more angry at the provocative actions of US imperialism. Everyone expressed condemnation and contempt for the shameless sophistry and all kinds of ugly behavior of imperialism. During Comrade Khrushchev's more than one-hour speech, the emotions of the representatives in the entire hall were high. The reporter seats and the diplomatic corps seats were packed. Comrade Khrushchev walked onto the podium with a roll of photos. He held up the first large photo, which was taken by the intruding US aircraft at an altitude of 20,000 meters over Soviet territory, clearly showing two rows of Soviet aircraft on the military airport. Another photo was also of a military airport and aircraft. Another photo was of gasoline depots and industrial buildings. These irrefutable material evidence showed how ridiculous the lies of US imperialism were. The representatives constantly applauded and roared with laughter, supporting the strike against the US aggressors and mocking the shameless denials of the US State Department. From the representatives' seats, there were bursts of shouts of "Shameful!" "Shameful!" and bursts of stormy applause.
    The people throughout the Soviet Union also expressed unrestrained anger at the despicable conspiracies and provocative actions of the US imperialists. "Bandits!" "Shameless!", strong voices of protest against the US imperialist air bandits' violation of the Soviet border came from all directions of the country.
    Engineer Mazurova of the Moscow "Dynamo" factory pointed out at a rally that if anyone dares to invade the sacred border of the Soviet Union, they will suffer the same fate as the American air bandits. Worker Aripov of the Stalinabad Shoe Factory said that we are rejoicing in the wonderful changes taking place in our country, but we cannot forget the imperialist forces that are trying to prevent our victorious advance toward communism. Let the gentlemen of the Pentagon remember that the Soviet people will use a strong fist to fight back against them. Officers and soldiers of the Soviet troops also expressed at the rallies that in order to counter the provocations of the Cold War elements, they must be better prepared for war and vigilantly defend the motherland.

    正义的谴责
    本报记者
    苏联最高苏维埃第五次会议在克里姆林宫会议大厅里举行了三天。三天里，全体代表在一致拥护和欢呼政府为进一步提高人民生活水平而采取的措施的同时，对美帝国主义坚持冷战和军备竞赛，甚至进行对苏联直接挑衅，表示了正义的愤怒和严正的谴责。
    当赫鲁晓夫同志揭露美国飞机侵犯苏联时，会场上代表们激愤的情景，是记者多年来在苏联最高苏维埃会议上从来没有遇到过的。
    赫鲁晓夫同志在谈到五一节美国飞机侵入苏联领空后说，当时苏联政府决定，无论如何一定要把敌机打下来，“这个任务完成了——飞机被打了下来！”这时候，代表们马上高兴得轰动起来，雷鸣般的掌声响彻全场，代表们高喊：“打得正确！”“正确！”“侵略者无耻！”
    当赫鲁晓夫同志谈到，这架飞机是美国派来的时候，有位代表在台下大声气愤地说：“这和艾森豪威尔的假仁慈的演说怎能联系呢？这是道地的强盗行为啊！”
    报告结束以后，在当天下午的会议上，会议执行主席向代表们说大会接到了苏联各地劳动人民打来的电报，苏联人民一致支持政府的严惩入侵者的措施，并对美国侵略者的活动表示极大的愤怒。基辅的一位退伍军人在电报里说：“谢谢你，亲爱的党！给战争贩子以最适时的打击！乌拉！”
    世界上还有什么事情比自己的祖国被帝国主义强盗无耻侵犯更为气愤的呢。在三天会议期间，我们看到每一个代表都是满怀愤怒的心情走上讲坛，痛斥美帝国主义侵犯苏联的强盗行径，同时也看到每一个代表都表示了保卫祖国安全的坚定决心和毁灭一切侵略者的无比信心。
    请听苏联元帅格列奇科的发言吧！他说，美国军用飞机侵犯苏联完全是可耻的十足的强盗行为，这一事实又一次暴露了帝国主义者是各国人民和平和安全的不共戴天的敌人，美国军用飞机这一强盗般的侵犯苏联领空是试图侦察苏联的国防能力，但是挑衅终于破产了，苏联的第一发火箭就击落了侵入苏联的美国飞机，让那些战争冒险家和挑衅者们知道，苏联是有足够的武装来对付侵犯者的，苏军警惕地监视着侵略势力的行动并且决不放过他们任何一个挑衅行动。
    斯特鲁耶夫代表提出疑问说，在艾森豪威尔即将访问苏联的时候，美国军用飞机侵入了苏联，苏联人不明白，按照美国的规矩，应该怎样解释呢？
    白俄罗斯代表基谢列夫理直气壮地责问说，“艾森豪威尔知道这次侵略活动吗？难道五角大楼，肆无忌惮的冒险家没有得到艾森豪威尔同意就能进行这次侵略活动的吗？”
    机车司机教练员索尔金在会议休息时对人们指出，从这次侵犯行动就可以看出美国政客们口口声声喊和平而实际上干的是什么，索尔金说，“我的同志们要求赫鲁晓夫同志在会见艾森豪威尔时直接了当地说‘这样干是不行的！’”
    赫鲁晓夫同志7日在最高苏维埃会议上发表的结束语使代表们对美帝国主义的挑衅行为更感到无比的愤怒。大家对帝国主义的无耻狡辩和百般丑态，一致表示了斥责和轻蔑的态度。在赫鲁晓夫一个多钟头的发言中，整个会场上代表们的情绪激昂。记者席上和外交使团席上都座无虚席。赫鲁晓夫同志带着一卷照片走上讲台，他高举着第一张大幅照片，这是侵入的美机在二万米的高空在苏联领土上拍摄的，上面清楚地现出军用机场上的两排苏联飞机。另一张照片同样是军用飞机场和飞机。另一张是汽油仓库和工业建筑物的照片。这些无可辩驳的物证说明了美帝国主义的谎言是多么可笑。代表们不断鼓掌和哄笑，支持对美国侵略者的打击，嘲笑美国国务院的无耻狡赖。从代表席上，发出一阵又一阵的“可耻”、“可耻”的喊声，一阵又一阵的暴风雨般的掌声。
    苏联各地人民对美帝国主义者的卑鄙阴谋和挑衅行动也表示了不可抑制的愤怒。“强盗！”“无耻！”，抗议美帝国主义空中强盗侵犯苏联疆界的强烈声音来自全国四面八方。
    莫斯科“狄纳莫”工厂工程师马祖洛娃在集会上指出，如果谁胆敢侵犯苏联的神圣疆界，那么他就将遭到和美国空中强盗同样的命运。斯大林纳巴德制鞋厂工人阿里波夫说，我们为我国生活中发生的美好变化而欢欣鼓舞，但是我们不能忘记极力阻挠我们向共产主义胜利前进的帝国主义势力。要让五角大楼的先生们记住，苏联人民将用强有力的拳头来回击他们。苏联各部队的官兵在集会上也都纷纷表示，为了回击冷战分子的挑衅行动，要更加作好战争准备，警惕地守卫祖国。
