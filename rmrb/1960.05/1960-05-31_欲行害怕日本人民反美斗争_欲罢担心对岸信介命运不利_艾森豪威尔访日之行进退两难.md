Xinhua News Agency, May 30th dispatch from Washington: There are various indications that the American ruling clique is increasingly uneasy about the scheduled "visit" of Eisenhower to Japan. Although the White House has repeatedly stated that Eisenhower will go to Tokyo on June 19 as scheduled, Senator J. William Fulbright, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said on the 29th that unless Eisenhower receives a "proper welcome," he does not think Eisenhower should visit Japan.

Fulbright's remarks clearly stem from the fact that the Japanese people, in their struggle against the American running dog Nobusuke Kishi's forcing the Japanese House of Representatives to pass the new Japan-U.S. military treaty, resolutely oppose the head of U.S. imperialism, Eisenhower, from going to Japan for a "visit."

A report from Tokyo by United Press International on the 28th said, "It is now certain that President Eisenhower's visit to Japan will put both sides in a difficult position. It is equally certain that canceling the visit would create even greater difficulties." The report maliciously stated that if Nobusuke Kishi, under pressure from the people, suggests canceling the visit, "it would be tantamount to admitting that this country can use the standards of mobs as a guide"; "if Eisenhower himself cancels the visit, it would cause the already tottering pro-Western government of Nobusuke Kishi to collapse."

The report said that the clouds surrounding Eisenhower's "visit" are "dark and dismal."

Another report from Tokyo by the same American news agency on the 27th said, "The visit will probably cause embarrassment on both sides of the Pacific." The report uneasily pointed out that in the Japanese people's recent angry struggle against the U.S.-Japan military treaty, "anti-American" slogans "appeared."

The "Mainichi Shimbun" of Tokyo published today a report from Washington by its special correspondent Omori, saying that the U.S. government was very embarrassed after receiving news of the Japanese people's opposition to Eisenhower's visit to Japan. Omori said that when Nobusuke Kishi went to Washington to sign the "security" treaty, he assured Eisenhower that the treaty would be smoothly passed by the Japanese Diet. At that time, Eisenhower believed Nobusuke Kishi. Omori also pointed out, "Eisenhower hoped to use overseas visits to Japan and (South) Korea to beautifully decorate the last part of his political life." Omori said, "But the recent developments in Japan caused by the 'security' treaty and Eisenhower's visit to Japan seem to have surprised Eisenhower."

### 欲行害怕日本人民反美斗争　欲罢担心对岸信介命运不利  艾森豪威尔访日之行进退两难

    欲行害怕日本人民反美斗争　欲罢担心对岸信介命运不利
    艾森豪威尔访日之行进退两难
    新华社30日讯　华盛顿消息：有种种迹象表明，美国统治集团对预定进行的艾森豪威尔对日本的“访问”越来越感到不安。尽管白宫已一再申明艾森豪威尔将如期在6月19日前往东京，但是美国参议院外交委员会主席富布赖特29日说，除非艾森豪威尔将受到“正当的欢迎”，否则他不认为艾森豪威尔应当访问日本。
    富布赖特的这一番话显然是从这一事实出发的：日本人民在反对美国走狗岸信介强使日本众议院通过新日美军事条约的斗争中，坚决反对美帝国主义的头子艾森豪威尔前往日本“访问”。
    合众国际社28日从东京发出的一则消息说，“现在可以肯定艾森豪威尔总统对日本的访问将会使双方都处于困境。同样可以肯定的是，取消这次访问会造成更大的困境”。这条消息恶意地说，要是岸信介在人民压力下建议取消这次访问，“这将等于承认这个国家可以用暴民的准则作为指针”；“要是艾森豪威尔自己取消这次访问，那会使已经摇摇欲坠的岸信介亲西方政府垮台”。
    消息说，笼罩着艾森豪威尔“访问的云是阴暗的和悲惨的”。
    这家美国通讯社27日从东京发出的另一则消息说，“这次访问大概会在太平洋两岸造成尴尬的处境”，消息不安地指出，在日本人民最近反对日美军事条约的愤怒斗争中，“出现了”反美口号。
    东京“每日新闻”今天刊登该报特派记者大森自华盛顿发出的消息说，美国政府在得到日本人民反对艾森豪威尔访问日本的消息后非常狼狈。大森说，岸信介到华盛顿去签订“安全”条约时曾向艾森豪威尔保证，这个条约将在日本国会顺利通过。当时艾森豪威尔相信了岸信介。大森还指出，“艾森豪威尔希望用到海外访问日本和（南）朝鲜来把他的政治生活的最后部分漂亮地装饰起来”。大森说，“但是‘安全’条约和艾森豪威尔访问日本所引起的日本最近的发展，似乎已经使得艾森豪威尔吃惊。”
