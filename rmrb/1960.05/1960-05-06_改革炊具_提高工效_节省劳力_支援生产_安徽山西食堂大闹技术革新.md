    Reform Cookware, Increase Efficiency, Save Labor, Support Production
    Anhui and Shanxi Dining Halls Stage Technical Innovation
    (Our report) A mass cookware reform movement has been launched in rural dining halls in Anhui Province. More than 1.15 million pieces of new and improved cookware have been produced. 61% of rural dining halls in the province have implemented cookware reform, and more than 48,900 dining halls have basically achieved complete sets of cookware, realizing semi-mechanization.
    Due to the large-scale cookware reform, efficiency has generally increased two to six or seven times compared to the original manual operation. The integrated vegetable cutting machine created by the Satellite Dining Hall of Guzhen Commune in Lingbi County can cut shreds, slices, and roots. One person can operate it to cut 3,000 to 3,500 catties of vegetables per hour, which is about 100 times more efficient than manual vegetable cutting. The quick steamed bread cutting machine created in Taihe County allows one person to cut 150 to 200 catties of steamed bread per hour. The use of advanced cookware has enabled the average dining hall in the province to provide meals for 50 people per cook. The number of cooks in rural dining halls across the province has been reduced from more than 840,000 to more than 570,000, saving a total of more than 267,000 laborers, which has strongly supported agricultural production.
    Dining halls that have achieved cookware improvement and semi-mechanization have not only improved the quality of food but also saved grain and firewood, which is welcomed by the broad masses of commune members. The more than 35,000 "one-dragon stoves" and "plum blossom stoves" promoted in Bengbu and Lu'an Special Zones can save more than 3.5 million catties of firewood and grass every day. The "one-dragon stove" created by Guzhen Commune in Lingbi County reduces the cost by 50% compared to the old-style stove and saves 80% of the grate bars.
    Because advanced cookware reduces the labor intensity of cooks and shortens working hours, cooks have ample time for production, building up the dining hall's assets, and engaging in political and cultural studies. At present, cooks in dining halls across the province are raising a total of 2,065,700 pigs, planting more than 4.8 million mu of vegetables, and raising a large number of chickens, ducks, geese, fish, sheep, etc. Some have also opened tofu workshops, pickled vegetable workshops, and flour mills.
    (Our report) A large-scale cookware reform movement is underway in rural areas of Shanxi Province. According to recent statistics, more than 400,000 pieces of cookware and grain processing tools suitable for dining halls have been modified, imitated, and created throughout the province. More than 40% of rural dining halls in the province have initially achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization of cooking operations and grain processing.
    The characteristics of cookware reform in Shanxi Province are starting with local methods, self-reliance, everyone participating, and large-scale collaboration. More than 37,000 power, water, and wind-powered grinding mills have emerged throughout the province, and newly improved thimble mills and roller mills powered by livestock have also been widely promoted. Many communes have created processing tools that allow one animal to pull multiple mills. Cookware reforms are readily available. Many dining halls use electric blowers and have created foot-operated blowers. Some have made their own porcelain pipes, bamboo pipes, tile pipes, wooden troughs, raised well platforms, or built water towers and installed "local tap water" in the dining halls. In the suburbs of Houma City in southern Shanxi and in many communes in Wanrong County, steam stoves have been built to use steam to boil water and cook meals.
    The great innovation and development of cookware have saved a large number of laborers who have been put into rural production. After more than 9,700 rural dining halls in the Jin Southeast Special Zone underwent major cookware reforms, the scale of these dining halls was larger than in the past, but the number of cooks was reduced from 96,000 to 60,000.
    With the innovation of cookware, the dining halls have been further consolidated and improved, and some advanced dining halls have gradually expanded the scope of services for the lives of commune members. The Yangtan Management Area Dining Hall of Qucun Commune in Houma City established a "local tap water tower," which, in addition to the dining hall's use, also set up water stations according to the residential points of commune members, solving the problem of domestic water for commune members. Dining halls in Qingxu and other counties have also established tea stoves to solve the problem of drinking water and water usage for commune members. In order to take care of local customs and facilitate the masses, many commune dining halls have democratically formulated care measures for commune members' weddings and funerals.

    改革炊具　提高工效　节省劳力　支援生产
    安徽山西食堂大闹技术革新
    本报讯　安徽省农村食堂掀起了群众性的炊具改革运动，新制和改制的先进炊具达一百一十五万多件，全省有61％的农村食堂实行了炊具改革，四万八千九百多个食堂已经基本达到炊具配套成龙，实现了半机械化。
    由于大规模的炊具改革，工效普遍比原来手工操作提高二倍到六、七倍。灵壁县固镇公社卫星食堂创制的综合切菜机，能切丝、切片、切根，一人操作每小时可切菜三千斤至三千五百斤，比原来手工切菜工效提高一百倍左右。太和县创制的快速切馍机，一人操作每小时可切面一百五十斤至二百斤。先进炊具的使用，使全省食堂平均达到每个炊事员可做五十人的饭菜。全省农村食堂炊事人员已由八十四万多人减少到五十七万多人，共节约出劳动力二十六万七千多人，有力地支援了农业生产。
    实现了炊具改良和半机械化的食堂，既提高了饭菜质量，还节约了粮食和烧柴，受到广大社员的欢迎。蚌埠、六安专区推广的三万五千多座“一条龙灶”、“梅花灶”，每天可节约三百五十多万斤柴、草。灵壁县固镇公社创制的“一条龙灶”比旧式灶减少造价50％，节约炉条80％。
    由于先进炊具减轻了炊事员的劳动强度，缩短了工作时间，使炊事员有充裕的时间生产，为食堂建立家底，还有时间从事政治文化学习。目前，全省食堂炊事员利用业余时间共养猪二百零六万五千七百头，种菜四百八十多万亩，还饲养了大量的鸡、鸭、鹅、鱼、羊等，有的还开办了豆腐坊、酱菜坊、粉坊等。
    本报讯　山西省农村大搞炊具改革运动。据最近统计，全省改制、仿制、创制适用于食堂的炊具和粮食加工工具已达四十多万件，占全省40％以上的农村食堂，已初步实现了炊事操作、粮食加工机械化和半机械化。
    山西省炊具改革的特点是土法上马，自力更生，人人动手，大搞协作。全省已出现了电力、水力、风力动力碾磨三万七千多盘（处），新改进的顶针磨和滚碾等畜力磨碾，也普遍推广使用。许多公社创造了一畜拉动多盘磨的加工工具，炊具改革更是应有尽有。许多食堂利用电力吹风，创造了脚踏吹风机；有的自制瓷管、竹管、瓦管、木槽、加高井台或建立水塔，在食堂安装了“土自来水”；晋南侯马市郊，万荣县许多公社食堂并建立了蒸气灶，利用蒸气烧水作饭。
    炊具大革新大发展，省出大批劳力投入了农村生产。晋东南专区九千七百多个农村食堂经过炊具大革新以后，这些食堂的规模比过去扩大了，而炊事人员却由过去的九万六千人，缩减至六万人。
    随着炊具革新，食堂得到进一步巩固提高，一些先进食堂逐步扩大了为社员生活的服务范围。侯马市曲村公社杨谈管理区食堂建立了“土自来水塔”，除食堂使用外，还按社员居住点设立了水站，解决了社员家庭用水。清徐等县食堂还建立了茶炉，解决了社员喝水、用水的问题。有许多公社食堂为了照顾当地风俗习惯，方便群众，民主制定了社员婚丧嫁娶照顾办法。
