Xinhua News Agency, 26th: Taipei Dispatch: The U.S. invading forces have repeatedly committed atrocities of insulting Taiwanese women in Taiwan, arousing widespread indignation among the Taiwanese people. In cities such as Kaohsiung and Keelung, people are demanding the expulsion of the American invaders.

According to Taiwan newspaper reports, in Kaohsiung City, there have been many recent incidents of American soldiers gathering in the streets to harass Taiwanese women, causing great resentment among the citizens of Kaohsiung. Many people have written letters to the Kaohsiung City Police Bureau of the Chiang Kai-shek Group, demanding that they promptly stop the atrocities of the American beasts. Many citizens strongly stated in their letters that if the police authorities did not dare to stop them, they would take more drastic measures to deal with the American beasts. Kaohsiung's "China Evening News" said that the Kaohsiung City Police Bureau of the Chiang Kai-shek Group, fearing a large-scale anti-American wave, recently submitted a document to the "Ministry of Foreign Affairs" of the Chiang Kai-shek Group, "requesting the U.S. military authorities to order U.S. military officers and soldiers not to be disgraceful on the streets." It stated that the Kaohsiung "citizens deeply resent the heinous acts of U.S. military officers and soldiers gathering in the streets to harass women, and councilors have been criticizing each other. If it is not stopped in time, it will surely provoke a civil uprising."

Taiwan newspapers said that the American beasts in Kaohsiung even broke into private homes with guns and weapons, committing murder and raping women. Not long ago, Wang Yueping, a woman living in Desheng Lane, Xinxing District, Kaohsiung City, was raped by an American soldier named Ham, who broke into her house with a gun. He also beat Wang Yueping's husband, Zhang Mintong, and smashed furniture and dishes before escaping. After the incident, the citizens of Kaohsiung were very angry and advocated severely punishing the murderer. Seeing that public anger was hard to offend, the U.S. military authorities in Taiwan hurriedly escorted this American beast Ham back to the United States.

Taiwan newspapers revealed that a shocking atrocity of three American soldiers gang-raping a thirteen-year-old girl recently occurred in Keelung City, Taiwan. The victim was named Huang Baozhu, who was forced to work as a child laborer in the Peacock Tea House in Keelung City due to poverty. On the evening of the 14th, three American beasts lured her to a remote location and raped her. After this inhuman crime occurred, it quickly spread throughout Keelung City, and everyone was very resentful. Anti-American slogans such as "Avenge Huang Baozhu" and "Drive Away American Beasts" appeared on the streets.

    反抗侵台美军污辱妇女暴行
    台湾人民要求赶走美国兵
    新华社26日讯　台北消息：美国侵略军在台湾屡次犯下侮辱台湾妇女的暴行，激起了台湾人民普遍的愤慨。在高雄、基隆等市，人们纷纷要求赶走美国侵略者。
    据台湾报纸消息，在高雄市，最近发生了许多次美国兵聚众当街调戏台湾妇女的事件，使高雄市民十分痛恨。许多人写信给蒋介石集团高雄市警察局，要求及时制止美国兽兵的暴行。许多市民在信中强烈声明，如果警察当局不敢制止，他们就要采取更加激烈的手段对付美国兽兵。高雄市“中国晚报”说，蒋介石集团高雄市警察局因害怕发生大规模的反美浪潮，最近已具文要求蒋介石集团“外交部”“转请美军当局饬令美军官兵，不要在街上出丑”。其中说，对美军官兵聚众当街调戏妇女的恶行，高雄“市民反感甚深，议员交相指责，若不及时制止，势将激起民变”。
    台湾报纸说，美国兽兵在高雄甚至持枪械侵入民宅，行凶强奸妇女。不久前，住在高雄市新兴区德生里的妇女王月萍，被美国兵韩姆持枪闯进屋内强奸，并且殴伤王月萍的丈夫张敏通，捣毁了家具碗碟后逃去。事件发生后，高雄市民十分愤慨，纷纷主张严惩凶手。侵台美军当局见众怒难犯，竟把这个美国兽兵韩姆赶紧护送回美国。
    台湾报纸透露，台湾基隆市最近还发生了三个美国兵轮奸一个十三岁女童的骇人听闻的暴行。受害的女童名叫黄宝珠，她因家贫被迫在基隆市孔雀茶室当童工，14日晚上，三个美国兽兵竟把她诱骗到偏僻地点行凶蹂躏。这件灭绝人性的凶案发生后，迅速传遍了基隆市，人人都非常痛恨，市面上出现了“为黄宝珠报仇”、“赶走美国野兽”等反美标语。
