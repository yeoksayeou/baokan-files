    Jilin Province's spring sowing is nearing completion. On the basis of ensuring a complete success in spring plowing and production, the people of the province are launching a summer hoeing and production upsurge centered on ensuring full and strong seedlings.

    As of May 16, the sown area in Jilin Province accounted for about 90% of the planned sown area. The sowing period was ten days to half a month earlier than in previous years. The quality of this year's spring plowing operations is very good.

    All parts of the province are now seizing the time to complete the final work of spring plowing and production. Cadres at all levels, together with the broad masses of commune members, are carrying out a major inspection and replenishment campaign, checking area, quality, seedling emergence, and the completion of state plans, and replenishing area, measures, and missing seedlings. Cadres at all levels in Dunhua County went deep into the fields to inspect and accept them plot by plot. 10% of the county's third-class fields (with poor sowing quality) had been processed and fertilized before seedling emergence, ensuring that each plot of farmland met standards. According to incomplete statistics from the four regions of Changchun, Tonghua, Jilin, and Yanbian, 450,000 mu of farmland with missing seedlings have been replanted. In the final stage of spring sowing, those areas that have not fully completed the state plan are seizing the opportunity to carry out a concentrated sowing to ensure the comprehensive and over-fulfillment of the state plan. The province has already reclaimed 3,430,000 mu of wasteland, and various localities plan to seize the gap between spring sowing and summer hoeing to reclaim more wasteland.

    While carrying out the final work of spring sowing, various localities are further reforming weeding tools. In the areas of Siping, Tonghua, and Changchun, more than 50,000 summer hoeing tools have been reformed, striving to achieve semi-mechanization in major operations such as cultivating, weeding, and topdressing. Various localities have also prepared a large amount of topdressing fertilizer to ensure that crops are adequately nourished. The province has universally formulated technical operating procedures for field management, requiring that general fields be shoveled and harrowed more than three times, and high-yield fields be shoveled and harrowed five times, to ensure full and strong seedlings on every plot of farmland.

    Party committees at all levels have further strengthened their leadership over summer hoeing and production, and continue to promote the system of six-level cadre field battles. Various localities have widely launched competition campaigns to mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members, striving to win greater victories in summer hoeing production on the basis of a complete success in spring plowing and production.

    Xinhua News Agency: Various parts of Shaanxi Province, based on the characteristics of this year's timely spring sowing of crops, concentrated sowing period, and sudden cold weather during the seedling stage, have taken measures such as early pest control, early thinning, and early cultivation to strengthen the early management of spring sown crop seedlings, ensuring full, uniform, and vigorous seedlings.

    At present, the province's 4,360,000 mu of cotton fields, mainly in the Guanzhong cotton-producing area, have generally been harrowed once to loosen the soil and increase ground temperature. Some areas have also applied large amounts of warm fertilizers such as plant ash and wall pit soil to the cotton fields, as well as ammonium sulfate and superphosphate. Cotton aphids and other pests that are spreading have been eliminated. Recently, 100,000 cotton farmers in Weinan County launched a seedling management competition campaign centered on no diseases and pests, loosening of soil crusting, removal of weeds, application of seedling fertilizer, early thinning, and early cultivation. The province has promptly replanted and transplanted seedlings on more than 778,000 mu of land with missing seedlings, eliminating phenomena such as broken rows and missed sowing, ensuring full seedlings. At present, the cotton fields throughout the province are growing very vigorously, and have generally grown two true leaves.

    Autumn grain and potato crops have received careful management as soon as they emerged. Counties in the Shaanan area, in response to climate changes, have taken measures such as deep watering when the temperature is low and timely drainage when the temperature is high to protect the seedlings. The Shaanbei area has also used methods such as burning firewood for smoking and applying quick-acting fertilizers to reduce frost damage losses.

    From the province, special district, and county to the commune, a large number of cadres have been transferred to the fields to strengthen the leadership of early seedling management. Various counties have also universally convened seedling protection professional meetings, on-site meetings, and field consultation meetings. Production teams in various communes have organized specialized teams for pest control, thinning, cultivation, and fertilization during seedling management.

    Xinhua News Agency, Jinan: After a tenacious struggle, the people of Shandong Province have achieved a great victory in the battle against drought and sowing spring cotton. As of the 11th, the province has sown more than 10,670,000 mu of spring cotton. Now, more than 70% of the cotton has emerged.

    Shandong Province is one of the main cotton-producing provinces in the country. Since the beginning of spring, the province has experienced a spring drought that has not occurred in nearly five years, causing serious difficulties for spring sowing. However, after dozens of days and nights of arduous struggle by leaders, cadres and the masses, they finally overcame the drought demon. This year, Shandong Province's cotton sowing is not only progressing rapidly, but also of good quality. The amount of base fertilizer applied is large and of high quality. Generally, about 5,000 jin of base fertilizer is applied per mu of ordinary field, and more than 8,000 jin or 10,000 jin is applied to high-yield fields. The area of ​​improved varieties is larger than in any previous year. The Dai character cotton covers the entire province, realizing the improvement of varieties. Cotton planting technology has also been greatly improved, generally making it possible to use seeds according to soil quality and fertility, and implementing standardized seedling retention; high-yield fields have developed from points and patches last year to contiguous patches, and more than 80% of cotton fields have realized gardenization and water conservancy.

    In order to achieve full seedlings per mu and vigorous plants, cotton-producing areas are now widely launching a seedling inspection and replanting campaign, inspecting and replenishing at the same time. In Liaocheng Prefecture, one of the key cotton-producing areas, all 4 million mu of cotton fields in the area have been verified and replenished plot by plot.

    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou: A new upsurge in seedling inspection and replanting and cotton field management in the Henan cotton area has rapidly formed. This year, cotton in Henan Province was generally sown about ten days earlier than last year. However, due to insufficient soil moisture in most areas, drought-resistant sowing, and especially the abnormal spring climate, which was suddenly cold and hot, the early-sown cotton seedlings were attacked by frost when they were germinating. Therefore, about 10% to 20% of the cotton fields had serious phenomena of missing seedlings and broken ridges. In order to pass the full seedling stage and ensure that not a single seedling is missing or weak, all localities have recently seized the good opportunity of rainfall to launch a major inspection and replenishment campaign to check area, check seedling emergence, replenish area, and replenish missing seedlings. More than 700,000 people in Xinxiang Prefecture were mobilized to inspect and replenish at the same time. After a seven-day battle, all 1.4 million mu of cotton fields with missing seedlings and broken ridges in the area were replanted. At present, most areas of the province have basically completed the seedling inspection and replanting work.

    In order to harvest more pre-summer peaches, various localities have also actively carried out seedling management work while inspecting and replanting seedlings. More than half of the cotton fields in Xinxiang, Nanyang, Kaifeng, Xuchang and other prefectures have been cultivated and loosened, and Nanyang Prefecture has also applied 250,000 mu of topdressing fertilizer in combination with cultivation, generally applying 2,000 to 3,000 jin of coarse fertilizer. Most areas of the province have begun thinning and fixing seedlings. Xinxiang Prefecture has launched a mass debate on close planting, determined the number of reasonable close planting plants, generally fixing 4,000 to 6,000 plants, and has currently thinned more than 500,000 mu.

    In addition, based on the principle of "comprehensive prevention and control, combining indigenous and foreign methods, comprehensive elimination, and focusing on clearing up," the pest control area in the province reached more than 8.6 million mu.

    吉林陕西加强春播作物管理
    山东河南力争棉花苗全苗壮
    本报讯　吉林省春耕播种即将结束，全省人民在保证春耕生产满堂红的基础上，开展以苗全苗壮为中心的夏锄生产高潮。
    截至5月16日止，吉林全省播种面积已占计划播种面积90％左右。播种期比往年提早十天至半月。今年春耕作业的质量都很好。
    全省各地正在抓紧春耕生产的扫尾工作。各级干部同广大社员一起，开展查面积、查质量、查出苗、查完成国家计划和补面积、补措施、补缺苗的大查大补运动。敦化县各级干部深入田间，逐块检查，逐块验收，全县有10％的三类田（播种质量差）已在出苗前进行了加工补肥，做到了块块农田合乎规格。据长春、通化、吉林、延边四个地区不完全统计，目前已补种缺苗农田四十五万亩。在春播扫尾中，尚未全面完成国家计划的部分地区，正在抓紧时机，突击播种，保证全面超额完成国家计划。全省已经开荒三百四十三万亩，各地计划抓紧春播和夏锄间的空隙，再开垦一部分荒地。
    在突击春播扫尾工作的同时，各地正在进一步大改革中耕除草工具。四平、通化、长春地区已改革夏锄工具五万多件，力争在中耕、除草和追肥等主要作业方面实现半机械化。各地还准备了大量追肥，以保证作物吃饱。全省普遍地制定了田间管理技术操作规程，要求今年要做到一般田铲趟三遍以上，高产田做到五铲五趟，保证块块农田苗全苗壮。
    各级党委都进一步加强对夏锄生产的领导，继续推行六级干部田间大会战的制度。各地广泛开展竞赛运动，调动广大社员的积极性，争取在春耕生产满堂红的基础上，赢得夏锄生产的更大胜利。
    本报讯　陕西省各地根据今年春播作物播种适时、播期集中和苗期气候突然变冷等特点，采取早治虫、早间苗、早中耕等措施，加强春播作物的幼苗早期管理，保证苗全、苗齐、苗旺。
    现在，以关中产棉区为主的全省四百三十六万亩棉田，都普遍耙耱了一遍，疏松了土壤，提高了地温。有的地区还给棉田施入了大量的草木灰、墙坑土等暖性肥料，以及硫铵、过磷酸钙等。扑灭了正在蔓延的棉蚜等病虫害。渭南县十万棉农最近开展了无病虫、松板结、拔杂草、追苗肥、早间苗、早中耕为中心的苗期管理竞赛运动。全省对七十七万八千多亩缺苗地块，及时进行了补种和移苗，消灭了断条、漏播等现象，保证了全苗。现在，全省棉田生长十分健壮，普遍已长出两个真叶。
    秋粮和薯类作物，一出苗就得到了细致管理。陕南地区各县针对气候变化的情况，采取了气温低时深灌水，气温高及时排水等办法，保护了秧苗。陕北地区还进行了煨火熏烟、施速效性肥料等办法，减轻了冻害损失。
    从省、专、县到公社，都抽调了大批干部深入到田间，加强了幼苗早期管理的领导。各县还普遍召开了保苗专业会、现场会、田间会诊会等。各公社的生产队都组织了苗期管理的防虫、间苗、中耕、施肥等专业队。
    据新华社济南电　山东省人民经过顽强奋斗，抗旱播种春棉的战役已经取得伟大胜利。全省到11日止，春种棉花已达一千零六十七万多亩。现在，70％以上的棉花出了苗。
    山东省是全国主要产棉省份之一。入春以来，这个省发生了近五年来没有的春旱，给春种造成严重困难。但是，各级党委领导广大干部和群众经过几十个日夜的艰苦奋战，终于战胜了旱魔。今年山东省的棉花播种不但进度快，而且质量好。所施底肥数量多，质量高，一般田每亩施底肥五千斤左右，丰产田达八千斤、万斤以上。良种面积比过去任何一年都大，岱字棉遍及全省，实现了良种化。棉花种植技术也有很大提高，一般作到了根据土质肥瘦用种，实行规格留苗；丰产方已经由去年的点片发展到连片，80％以上的棉田实现了园田化和水利化。
    为了作到亩亩全苗，棵棵健壮，各产棉区现在正广泛展开查苗补苗运动，边查边补。重点产棉区之一的聊城专区，全区四百万亩棉田，已经方方核实，块块查补。
    据新华社郑州电　河南棉区查苗补苗、棉田管理的新高潮已经迅速形成。河南省今年棉花一般比去年提前播种十天左右。但是，由于大部地区墒情不足，抗旱播种，特别是春季气候失常，忽冷忽热，早播棉苗在萌芽时受了霜冻侵袭，因此，大约有10％到20％左右的棉田缺苗断垅现象严重。为了过好全苗关，保证一棵不少，一棵不弱，各地最近都抓紧落雨的良好时机，掀起了查面积、查出苗、补面积、补缺苗的大查大补运动。新乡专区出动七十多万人，边查边补，大战七天，全区一百四十万亩有缺苗断垅现象的棉田，全部进行了补种。目前，全省大部地区，已基本上结束了查苗补苗工作。
    为了多结伏前桃，各地在查苗补苗同时，还积极开展了苗期管理工作。新乡、南阳、开封、许昌等专区一半以上的棉田已经中耕松土，南阳专区还结合中耕施追肥二十五万亩，一般追粗肥二千到三千斤。全省大部地区已经开始了间苗定苗工作，新乡专区开展全民性的密植大辩论，确定了合理密植株数，一般定苗四千到六千株，目前已间苗五十多万亩。
    此外，各地本着“全面防治，土洋结合，全面消灭，重点肃清”的方针，全省治虫面积达八千六百多亩。
