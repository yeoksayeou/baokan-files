　　Xinhua News Agency, May 28th, Tokyo Dispatch: Japanese Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke today, at a cabinet press conference he held, indicated that he would disregard the demands of the vast Japanese people, refuse to resign and dissolve the Diet, and would continue to rely on the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" as his future policy direction.

　　Kishi Nobusuke said at the press conference that using cabinet resignation and dissolution of the Diet to resolve the situation "should not be adopted." He admitted that "it is true that some people within the Liberal Democratic Party say that the Diet should be dissolved and the entire cabinet should resign to resolve the political situation," but he expressed "firm opposition to dissolving the Diet under the current circumstances," and described the demand for the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet to resign as "irresponsible thinking." He also said that if he were forced to dissolve the Diet now, "it would be tantamount to yielding to the power of demonstrations held by specific organized forces." In this way, he openly expressed his fascist stance of hostility and resistance to the patriotic demonstration struggles reflecting the will of the broad strata of the Japanese people.

　　Kishi Nobusuke attempted to defend the ruling party's act of forcibly "passing" the new "Security Treaty" in the House of Representatives with police violence. He pretentiously said, "I feel politically responsible for the chaotic political situation that occurred on the evening of the 19th regarding the forced extension of the Diet session and the voting on the Security Treaty." Then he said that this was not because he "did something bad." He insisted that taking measures to call the police into the Diet to force the House of Representatives to "pass" the new "Security Treaty" was "unavoidable."

　　Not only that, Kishi Nobusuke in turn accused the opposition parties of boycotting Diet meetings in protest against the fascist behavior of the Kishi Nobusuke group. He clamored that regarding the "abnormal" problem of the Diet, "the opposition parties should also reflect." He also attacked Japanese newspapers again for their reporting on this issue. He said that the recent news in the newspapers "lacked objectivity."

　　Kishi Nobusuke expressed his intention to have the House of Councillors "deliberate" on this new "Security Treaty" that was forcibly voted on in the House of Representatives, in order to complete the disgraceful process of forcing the Diet to "pass" this treaty that was spurned by the Japanese people. He clamored that his "future policy is to rely on the Security Treaty, stand on the position of liberalism, and seek Japan's prosperity through Japan-U.S. cooperation."

　　Kishi Nobusuke obsequiously expressed his hope that U.S. President Eisenhower would visit Japan on the originally scheduled date, and attacked the Socialist Party's legitimate demand to the U.S. Embassy to oppose Eisenhower's visit to Japan as "impolite behavior." He indicated to the United States that he would suppress the Japanese people's opposition to Eisenhower's visit. He said that the government would take full responsibility for handling "public order and other issues"; and also said, "There is absolutely no problem in protecting President Eisenhower."

    岸信介坚持与人民敌对到底
    公开蔑视舆论拒绝内阁总辞职和解散国会
    叫嚷要继续投靠美国加紧镇压日本人民反美爱国运动
    新华社28日讯　东京消息：日本首相岸信介今天在他举行的内阁记者招待会上，表明他将不顾日本广大人民的要求，拒绝辞职和解散国会，而且要把依靠新日美“安全条约”作为他今后的政策方针。
    岸信介在记者招待会上说，用内阁总辞职和解散国会的办法来收拾局面，“是不应当采取的”。他承认，“自由民主党内一部分人说应当解散国会，实行（内阁）全体辞职以收拾政局，这是真实情况”，但是他表示“坚决反对在目前情况下解散国会”，而把要岸信介内阁辞职的要求说成是“不负责任的想法”。他还说，如果现在被迫解散国会，“就等于对以特定的组织力量举行的示威力量表示屈服”。这样，他就公开表明了他敌视和顽抗反映日本广大阶层人民意志的爱国示威斗争的法西斯立场。
    岸信介企图为执政党用警察暴力在众议院强行“通过”新“安全条约”的行为辩解。他装模作样地说，“关于19日晚间发生的强行延长国会会期和表决安全条约（而引起的）这种政局混乱状态，我是感到政治上的责任的”。随后他就说，这并不是因为他“做了坏事”。他硬说采取把警察叫进国会来迫使众议院“通过”新“安全条约”的措施是“不得已的”。
    不仅如此，岸信介反过来指责为抗议岸信介集团这种法西斯行为而抵制国会会议的在野党。他叫嚷，关于国会“不正常”的问题，“在野党也应当反省”。他还再次攻击日本报纸对这个问题的报道。他说，报纸最近的消息“缺乏客观性”。
    岸信介表示要参议院“审议”这项在众议院强行表决的新“安全条约”，来完成他强迫国会“通过”这项为日本人民唾弃的条约的不体面的过程。他叫嚷，他“今后的方针是，依靠安全条约、站在自由主义的立场，通过日美合作，以期求得日本的繁荣”。
    岸信介奴颜婢膝地表示希望美国总统艾森豪威尔按原订日期访问日本，并且攻击社会党向美国大使馆提出反对艾森豪威尔访日的正当要求是“不礼貌的行为”。他向美国表示要镇压日本人民反对艾森豪威尔访问的行动。他说，政府将负起一切责任来处理“治安和其他问题”；还说，“保护艾森豪威尔总统的工作绝对没有问题”。
