Dear Comrades of the Chinese Mountaineering Team:

Amidst the excellent situation of the continuous leap forward in our country's socialist construction, and on the eve of the upcoming National Congress of Heroes of the Cultural and Educational Front, the news of your ascent to the world's highest peak—Mount Qomolangma—has arrived. This is extremely joyous news for the people of our country. You have won great honor for our great motherland and once again made a glorious contribution to the cause of socialist sports. I extend my warmest congratulations to you! Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao and illuminated by the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, you have displayed soaring revolutionary vigor, endured countless hardships, and overcome numerous difficulties, finally reaching the world's highest peak.

Comrades! Your victory fully demonstrates the fine qualities of diligence, bravery, and tenacity of the Chinese people, as well as the spirit of unity, love for the motherland's honor, collectivism, and communism. Your heroic deeds once again prove that there are no insurmountable natural barriers before the Chinese people, and no difficulties can stop our courageous advance! This is a victory for the Party's General Line! It is a victory for the incomparably superior socialist system! It is a victory for the unity of the Han and Tibetan peoples!

Dear Comrades! You have set a brilliant example for sports workers and athletes across the country. Your victory will greatly encourage and promote the further development of our country's sports cause, especially mass mountaineering activities. However, in our great motherland, there are more peaks waiting for you to climb, and more abundant natural wealth waiting for you to explore. I hope you will continue to advance, exert even greater efforts in conquering our motherland's high mountains and steep ranges, and better serve the high-speed development of socialist construction through mountaineering.
