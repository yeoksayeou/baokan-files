Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 5th. The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published a commentary today exposing the traitorous nature of the Huh Jung faction's so-called "caretaker cabinet," which inherited the mantle of the Syngman Rhee puppet regime. It also pointed out that the South Korean people can only realize their hopes and demands by immediately abolishing all the old institutions of the Syngman Rhee fascist reign of terror and establishing a temporary administrative body composed of representatives of workers, farmers, students, scientists, cultural figures, soldiers, entrepreneurs, and merchants.

The commentary stated that the new puppet government in South Korea, which has only changed its signboard, is, from any perspective, nothing more than a replica and continuation of the Syngman Rhee puppet regime. In particular, the so-called "government statement" issued by this "government" on May 3rd further exposed that they are not prepared to retreat one step from the Syngman Rhee fascist reign of terror system.

The commentary said that this so-called "government statement" first clamored that "the current government will more resolutely implement the anti-communist policy than in the past." Everyone remembers that all the fascist repressions and all the barbaric atrocities carried out by the traitor Syngman Rhee puppet government over the past twelve years were carried out under the banner of "anti-communism."

The commentary pointed out that the Huh Jung faction listed many pleasant-sounding deceptive words such as "political reform" in this so-called "government statement," but they did not touch a hair on the Syngman Rhee fascist reign of terror apparatus. Not only did they not punish Syngman Rhee, but they also invited him to be a "senior advisor" and even sent him guards; after Lee Ki-poong embarked on the shameful end of a traitor, they even wept and wailed and wanted to hold a "state funeral." The Huh Jung faction also stopped the struggle to eliminate the bullying bureaucrats who colluded with the Syngman Rhee group, which was launched by various schools and agencies in South Korea, and attempted to keep the Syngman Rhee fascist ruling structure intact.

The commentary said that the fifth item of this so-called "government statement" even more clearly exposed the traitorous nature of the Huh Jung faction as a faithful lackey of U.S. imperialism. They said something like "saying that the U.S. government interfered in internal affairs in this coup is an act of responding to North Korea's propaganda," and so on.

After pointing out that the people of the world all accuse the United States of interfering in Korean internal affairs, and even American newspapers admit this fact, the commentary said that the Huh Jung faction only knows how to flatter the American masters and suppress the people, and shamelessly and perversely howls.

The commentary said that when the traitor Syngman Rhee group, under the instructions of U.S. imperialism, opened fire on South Korean students and people, creating a bloody tragedy, the Huh Jung faction was obsequiously preparing to accept the puppet regime. Now, the Huh Jung traitors can no longer be allowed to defile the precious blood shed by the South Korean students.

The commentary pointed out that the so-called "caretaker cabinet" also inherited Syngman Rhee's so-called "immigration plan," and openly clamored on May 3rd to sell South Korean compatriots as slaves to foreign countries. This fact clearly shows that the so-called "caretaker cabinet" is a continuation of the Syngman Rhee puppet government.

The commentary said that it is very clear that although the traitor Syngman Rhee has stepped down, the Huh Jung faction and the South Korean ruling group surrounding him have stolen the price of the South Korean people's blood and are attempting to use it to satisfy their political ambitions. The South Korean people must not sit idly by and watch this situation. Now, they have ignited new flames of struggle even higher in Busan, Daegu, Seoul and other places.

### 朝鲜“劳动新闻”揭露许政集团的反动本质  南朝鲜人民决不许卖国贼横行

    朝鲜“劳动新闻”揭露许政集团的反动本质
    南朝鲜人民决不许卖国贼横行
    新华社平壤5日电　朝鲜“劳动新闻”今天发表评论，揭露继承李承晚伪政权的许政一派的所谓“看守内阁”的卖国奴本质。同时指出：南朝鲜人民只有立即废除李承晚法西斯恐怖统治的一切旧机构，成立包括工人、农民、青年学生、科学、文化界人士、士兵、企业家、商人的代表组成的临时行政机构，才能实现自己的希望和要求。
    评论说，只换上一块招牌的南朝鲜新的傀儡政府，不论从那一个角度看，也是丝毫未变的李承晚伪政权的翻版和继续。特别是5月3日这个“政府”发表的所谓“政府谈话”，更暴露了他们不准备由李承晚法西斯恐怖统治制度下后退一步。
    评论说，这个所谓“政府谈话”首先叫嚣“现政府要比过去更加坚决地推行反共政策”。谁都记得，卖国贼李承晚傀儡政府十二年来进行的一切法西斯镇压、一切野蛮暴政，正是在“反共”的招牌下进行的。
    评论指出，许政一派在这个所谓“政府谈话”中罗列了许多“政治改革”等好听的骗人词句，但是他们没有触动李承晚法西斯恐怖统治机构一根汗毛。他们不仅没有惩办李承晚，反而请他当“高级顾问”，甚至给他派去了警卫兵；李起鹏走上了卖国贼的可耻末路以后，他们还哭哭啼啼地要进行“国葬”。许政一派还制止南朝鲜各学校和机关展开的清除同李承晚集团相勾结的恶霸官僚的斗争，企图原封不动地保持李承晚的法西斯统治机构。
    评论说，这个所谓“政府谈话”第五项，更加不打自招地暴露了作为美帝国主义的忠实走狗的许政一派的卖国贼的本质。他们说什么“在这次政变中说美国政府干涉内政就是响应北朝鲜的宣传的行为”等等。
    评论在指出了全世界人民都指责美国干涉朝鲜内政、连美国报纸也承认这一事实后说，许政一派只知道阿谀美国主子和镇压人民，不顾羞耻、颠倒是非地狂叫。
    评论说，卖国贼李承晚集团在美帝国主义的指使下开枪射击南朝鲜青年学生和人民、制造流血惨剧的时候，许政一派正在奴颜婢膝地准备接受傀儡政权。现在再也不能允许许政卖国贼沾污南朝鲜青年学生们洒下的宝贵的鲜血了。
    评论指出，所谓的“看守内阁”还继承了李承晚的所谓“移民计划”，并且在5月3日公然叫嚣要把南朝鲜的同胞当作奴隶卖给外国，这一事实清楚地说明了所谓“看守内阁”就是李承晚傀儡政府的继续。
    评论说，很显然，卖国贼李承晚虽然下了台，但是许政一派和围绕着他的南朝鲜统治集团偷盗了南朝鲜人民血的代价，并且企图借此来满足他们的政治野心。南朝鲜人民决不能坐视这个情况。现在，他们已在釜山、大丘、汉城等地更高地燃起了新的斗争火焰。
