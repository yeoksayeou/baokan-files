Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 20th Dispatch: The Kishi Nobusuke group's fascist methods to forcibly "pass" the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" in the House of Representatives have aroused indignation among people from all walks of life in Japan, who have issued statements today to strongly condemn it.

早稲田 Waseda University Professor Masazane Yoshimura said in "Yomiuri Shimbun" that the Diet must be dissolved first to seek public opinion. He pointed out that Kishi Nobusuke's methods once again showed the face of him as a member of the Tojo Cabinet. Yoshimura pointed out that Kishi Nobusuke is an enemy of the Japanese people.

Meiji University Professor Hirotatsu Fujiwara said in "Mainichi Shimbun" that those who use "strength" to decide the major fate of the country will soon be resisted by the power of the people and ultimately suffer defeat.

Commentator Kenzo Nakajima angrily told the reporter of the "Japan News" weekly this morning that the Kishi Nobusuke group's approach is illegal, and the entire Japanese people will not accept this decision of the Diet. We must immediately overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet.

Kuroda Hisao, Socialist Party member of the "Security Treaty" Special Committee of the Japanese House of Representatives, announced, "The Socialist Party will use all possible means to concentrate its efforts to abolish the Security Treaty. Now our determination is even stronger than ever." According to newspaper reports, some Japanese monopoly capitalists are also worried about Kishi Nobusuke's tyrannical practices. Some capitalists believe that Kishi Nobusuke's practices are too radical and have left a stain on the history of parliamentary politics.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 20th Dispatch: Major bourgeois newspapers in Japan today published editorials condemning the Kishi Nobusuke group's fascist act of unilaterally forcing the House of Representatives to "pass" the new "Security Treaty."

"Asahi Shimbun" said that Kishi Nobusuke used this undue coercive means, which should be strongly condemned.

"Yomiuri Shimbun" said that this treaty was "passed" under the circumstance that the Japanese people have many doubts and anxieties about it, and there is nothing more unfortunate for the Japanese country and people than this matter.

"Tokyo Shimbun" said that this is an unprecedented atrocity in the history of the Japanese Diet and has left an inestimable stain on the history of the Diet.

"Mainichi Shimbun" condemned the Kishi Nobusuke group's practice as an "indisputable" tyranny. The only way to resolve this situation in the future is to dissolve the House of Representatives and hold a general election.
