Xinhua News Agency, May 26th—Premier Zhou Enlai hosted a banquet at the Banquet Hall of the Great Hall of the People this evening to welcome British Field Marshal Montgomery, who is visiting our country.

    Premier Zhou Enlai stated in his speech at the banquet that the Chinese people support Field Marshal Montgomery's efforts to ease international tensions and promote world peace. Premier Zhou also said that Field Marshal Montgomery's visit will certainly make a significant contribution to enhancing the friendship between the Chinese and British peoples and improving relations between the two countries. Field Marshal Montgomery stated in his speech that after returning to Britain, he would immediately and very clearly point out that "we should all be friendly to New China." He also said that his visit had enabled him to correct the common misconceptions about New China held in the Western world.

    Vice Premier of the State Council Marshal He Long, Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs Marshal Chen Yi, Vice Premier of the State Council and Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army General Luo Ruiqing, and Vice Premier of the State Council Xi Zhongxun attended the banquet.

    Premier Zhou spoke at the banquet. He said, we are hosting a banquet tonight for Field Marshal Montgomery, and I would like to take this opportunity to express our welcome to him on behalf of the Chinese people and the Chinese government. Premier Zhou said that Field Marshal Montgomery came to China with good wishes for a friendly visit. We had a good talk, and I believe his visit will definitely make a good contribution to enhancing the friendship between the Chinese and British peoples and improving relations between the two countries. Field Marshal Montgomery annihilated the Rommel fascist army in North Africa during World War II and enjoys a high reputation in the world. The Chinese people admire him very much.

    Premier Zhou said that now Field Marshal Montgomery is willing to make efforts to ease international tensions and promote world peace, and the Chinese people support his efforts. I would like to take this opportunity to raise a glass to the friendship between the Chinese and British peoples, to the health of Field Marshal Montgomery, and to the health of the British friends present.

    Field Marshal Montgomery said in his speech that he wanted to express his gratitude for the extremely gracious reception he had received in this country. The friendly welcome was more grand than he could have imagined before he came. It exceeded what he really expected. From the highest levels to the workers in the factories, everyone gave him a very friendly welcome. Even the pedestrians on the street seemed very happy to see him, thinking that he represented our country, which is a great honor.

    Field Marshal Montgomery said that it has been more than thirty years since I last came to China. That was the old China, which suffered from years of foreign aggression—perhaps Britain was not entirely blameless for this—and also suffered from domestic feudal oppression. That was a long time ago. Now a new China has been born. You have cleared away emperors, warlords, landlords, and foreign devils. All that is past. A new China has emerged under new leadership, determined to be the master of its own land and plan its own destiny in its own way without foreign interference. Based on what I have seen, I like the new China better than the old China.

    He said that the Western world has great misconceptions about New China. I see that the Chinese people are happy and cheerful; while in the Western world, people think that the Chinese people are very depressed and unhappy. I see that the Chinese people are very friendly and hope to get along well with all countries that are willing to be friendly to them. This is the situation of the Chinese people that I have seen; I want to say again: I very much like the situation of the new China that I have seen.

    He said that undoubtedly, New China faces huge tasks, which are long-term and difficult. There are huge problems in housing, industry, education, agriculture and many other aspects. But you have certain huge assets here in China—very strong people, who are very hardworking, both men and women, possibly the most hardworking people in the world; everyone has the same idea, working hard for the prosperity of New China under the leadership of its new leaders. I believe you will succeed in this huge task. If I personally can offer you anything to help New China, you only need to ask and it will be done.

    Field Marshal Montgomery added that this is a very short visit. But this visit is very worthwhile, it enables me to correct the common misconceptions about New China held in the Western world. I will definitely do this. I will return to Britain early next week, and I will immediately and very clearly state that we should all be friendly to New China.

    He said, I very much hope to extend a very warm invitation to Premier Zhou Enlai, asking him to visit my home in Britain as my personal guest, so that I can let him see my country, I very much hope he can come.

    He said, now I want to thank you again, Your Excellency, and everyone here, for your warm welcome tonight; I think it is a particularly friendly gesture to invite so many people I have met during my visit here tonight, female parachutists, soldiers and many others. I am very happy to be able to meet them again tonight. I am very grateful for inviting them here so that I can once again express my thanks to them for everything they have done for me. I would also like to express my gratitude for the very wonderful performance we saw here tonight; I hope to tell the artists and actors how much I appreciated their performance; I am convinced that everyone here appreciated it.

    Field Marshal Montgomery finally said, I usually do not drink alcohol, but tonight I will make a big exception and drink a toast to the prosperity of the People's Republic of China.

    Also attending the banquet were Li Siguang, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Zhang Zhizhong and Fu Zuoyi, Vice Chairmen of the National Defense Council, Zhang Hanfu and Luo Guibo, Vice Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Xiao Jingguang, Vice Minister of National Defense, Navy Senior General, Wang Shusheng Senior General, Li Da Senior General, Director of the China National Defense Sports Association, Rong Gaotang, Vice Chairman of the Sports Commission, Wan Li and Wu Han, Vice Mayors of Beijing, as well as heads of various people's organizations, and senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

    The heads of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the China Democratic League, the China National Democratic Construction Association, the China Association for Promoting Democracy, the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, the China Zhi Gong Party, the Jiusan Society, and the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League attended the banquet, including Shen Junru, Cai Tingkai, Nan Hanchen, Wang Shao'ao, Chen Qiyou, Xu Deheng, Xu Mengshan, and Xia Kangnong. Notables from all walks of life in the capital also attended the banquet.

    周总理表示支持他为缓和国际局势所作的努力
    蒙哥马利元帅在讲话中表示应该同新中国友好
    新华社26日讯　周恩来总理今天晚间在人民大会堂宴会厅举行宴会，欢迎来我国访问的英国蒙哥马利元帅。
    周恩来总理在宴会上讲话时表示，中国人民支持蒙哥马利元帅为缓和国际紧张局势和为世界和平所作的努力。周总理并且说，蒙哥马利元帅这次的访问，对增进中英两国人民的友好，对改进两国的关系！一定会有很好的贡献。蒙哥马利元帅在讲话中表示，他在返回英国后一定马上非常明确地指出，“对新中国，我们大家都应当同它友好”。他还说，他这次访问使他能够纠正西方世界普遍持有的对新中国的错误印象。
    国务院副总理贺龙元帅，国务院副总理兼外交部长陈毅元帅，国务院副总理、中国人民解放军总参谋长罗瑞卿大将，国务院副总理习仲勋，出席了宴会。
    周总理在宴会上讲话。他说，我们今天晚上设宴招待蒙哥马利元帅，我借此机会代表中国人民和中国政府对他表示欢迎。周总理说，蒙哥马利元帅带着很好的愿望到中国来进行友好访问，我们谈得很好，我相信他的访问对增进中英两国人民的友好，对改进两国的关系，一定会有很好的贡献。蒙哥马利元帅在第二次大战中，在北非消灭过隆美尔法西斯兵团，在世界上享有盛名，中国人民对他很敬佩。
    周总理说，现在蒙哥马利元帅又愿意为缓和国际紧张局势，为世界和平作出努力，中国人民支持他的这种努力。我借此机会举杯为中英两国人民的友好，为蒙哥马利元帅的健康，为在座的英国朋友们的健康干杯。
    蒙哥马利元帅在讲话中说，我要对我在这个国家所受到的极其殷勤的招待报以谢意。友好的欢迎比我来以前所可能想像到的都更为盛大。这超过了我真正预期的程度。从最高级直到工厂里的工人，所有的人都给了我非常友好的欢迎。甚至街头行人似乎都十分高兴看到我，认为我代表着我们国家，这是极大的荣幸。
    蒙哥马利元帅说，自从我上次来到中国以来，现在已经有三十多年了。那是旧中国，那个中国遭受了多年的外来的侵略——也许英国对此并不是毫无罪咎的，那个中国还遭受了国内的封建性质的压迫。那是在很久以前。现在一个新的中国已经诞生了。你们已经清除了帝王、军阀、地主和洋鬼子。一切都过去了。出现了新的领导下的新的中国，它决心要当自己土地上的主人，在毫无外来干涉的情况下按自己的方式规划自己的命运。根据我所看到的，我喜欢新中国甚于旧中国。
    他说，西方世界对新中国有很大的错误观念。我看到中国人民是高兴和快活的；而在西方世界，人们却认为中国人民是非常抑郁和不快的。我看到中国人民非常友好，希望同一切愿意对他们友好的国家友好相处。这就是我所看到的中国人民的情况；我要再说一遍：我非常喜欢我所看到的新中国的情况。
    他说，无疑，新中国的面前有着巨大的任务，这些任务是长期而困难的。存在着住房、工业、教育、农业和其他许多方面的各种巨大的
  问题。但是你们中国这里有某些巨大的资产——非常刚强的人民，他们是非常勤劳的，不论是男的和女的，可能是世界上最勤劳的民族；所有的人都怀有一致的想法，在它的新的领袖们的领导下为新中国的繁荣努力工作。我相信，你们在这项巨大的任务中一定会成功。如果我个人可以向你们提供什么东西来帮助新中国的话，你们只需要提出来就一定会办到。
    蒙哥马利元帅又说，这是一次为期很短的访问。但是这次访问是非常值得的，它使我能够纠正西方世界普遍持有的对新中国的错误印象。我一定会这样做。我将在下星期初返回英国，我一定马上非常明确地说明，对新中国，我们大家都应当同它友好。
    他说，我非常希望向周恩来总理发出非常热烈的邀请，请它作为我私人的客人亲临我在英国的家里来进行访问，这样我可以让他看看我的国家，我非常希望他能来。
    他说，现在我要再一次感谢阁下和在这里所有的人，感谢你们今晚的热烈欢迎；我认为，今晚邀请这么多我在这里访问期间遇到过的人，女跳伞员、军人和其他许多人到这里来，这是一种特别友好的表示。今晚能够再度同他们会见，感到非常高兴。我非常感谢邀请他们前来，使我能够再一次向他们表示我对他们为我所做的一切的谢意。我还要对我们今晚在这里看到的非常精彩的表演表示感激；我希望告诉艺术家和演员们，我是多么欣赏他们的演出；我深信，这里所有的人都很欣赏。
    蒙哥马利元帅最后说，我素不饮酒，但是今晚我将大大破例，为中华人民共和国的繁荣干杯。
    出席宴会的还有，政协全国委员会副主席李四光，国防委员会副主席张治中、傅作义，外交部副部长章汉夫、罗贵波，国防部副部长萧劲光，海军大将、王树声大将，中国人民国防体育协会主任李达上将，体育运动委员会副主任荣高棠，北京市副市长万里、吴晗，以及各人民团体的负责人，中国人民解放军高级将领。
