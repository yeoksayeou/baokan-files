Xinhua News Agency report: The spring planting plan for dryland grain crops in the Beijing suburbs has been completed for more than 90% of the area. Among them, the area planted with the three high-yield crops—corn, multispadix sorghum, and millet—accounts for more than 70% of the sown grain land, an increase of one-third compared to the same period last year. The high-yield demonstration plots established in Fangshan, Huairou, and Pinggu counties account for approximately 60% of the high-yield crop area.

While the basic planting of large areas of grain fields has been completed, the people's communes in the Beijing suburbs have launched a mass movement to make full use of idle land. According to statistics from eight counties (districts), nearly 500,000 mu of usable land edges, ditch banks, waste land, and barren slopes have been found, and more than 80,000 mu have been planted so far.

Currently, the people's communes in the suburbs are launching a production upsurge in planting sweet potatoes and rice. The planting area of these two high-yield crops will also be greatly expanded this year compared to last year.

    北京郊区旱地粮食作物基本种完
    据新华社讯　北京郊区旱地粮食作物的春播计划已经完成90％以上。其中玉米、多穗高粱、谷子三种高产作物的面积占到已播种粮田面积70％多，比去年同期增加了三分之一。房山、怀柔、平谷三县建立的丰产方，约占高产作物面积60％左右。
    在大面积粮田基本播完的同时，北京郊区各人民公社又掀起了充分利用空闲地的群众运动。据八个县（区）的统计，已经找到可以利用的地边、渠埂、废地、荒坡近五十万亩，目前已种上八万多亩。
    目前，郊区各人民公社正在掀起栽种白薯、水稻的生产高潮。今年这两种高产作物的种植面积也将比去年扩大很多。
