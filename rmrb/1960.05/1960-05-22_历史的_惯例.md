    The "Customs" of History
    Yú Jìng
    On May 18, Nobusuke Kishi, in the Special Committee on Security in the Diet, defended the United States' acts of aggression in every possible way, saying many shameless things. The most absurd and shameless was the statement that, in the current international situation, "collecting intelligence is a worldwide custom" and "a matter of course." Therefore, his "cooperation" with his master was also "irrelevant."
    The so-called "custom" that Nobusuke Kishi brought out is, of course, a far-fetched excuse. The purpose is undoubtedly to use this bandit logic to justify his master, cover up his own ugliness, and bite back at peace-loving countries. "I steal and you steal, we're even, it's the custom," Nobusuke Kishi used the mind of a thief to judge others, it's truly the extreme of rascality. However, Kishi's words are indeed a self-exposure of the true face of the aggressors. A dog cannot change its habit of eating dung, a weasel cannot stop stealing chickens, and a robber cannot stop stealing openly and secretly. The aggressive nature of imperialism and all reactionaries in destroying peace and launching wars is difficult to change. This is precisely the "custom" of all robbers that Nobusuke Kishi spoke of.
    In fact, the stuff that Nobusuke Kishi is peddling is nothing new; it is merely inheriting the old mantle of American imperialism. Look, Nobusuke Kishi's master, Eisenhower, outwardly plays the role of a "man of peace," but in reality, he has been plotting for a long time to sabotage the Four-Power Summit and implement a two-faced policy of false peace and genuine war preparation. This is also the "custom" of imperialists. The American government's acts of aggression have been severely condemned by the Soviet Union and the people of the world, and Eisenhower's mask of peace has been torn off. However, he insisted in a statement that this aggressive activity was a "necessary measure" "to ensure the security of the United States and the free world," and expressed his intention to continue provocative activities against the Soviet Union. Even after Eisenhower had achieved the evil purpose of sabotaging the Four-Power Summit, he still tried every means to cover up his crimes, colluding with his British and French imperialist accomplices to issue a statement, sanctimoniously saying that they "remain steadfast in their belief that all outstanding international issues" should be resolved through "peaceful methods." Eisenhower had one evil black hand caught, but used another hand, coated with white powder, to wave an olive branch twice. This is nothing but an act of self-deception. This arrogant and shameless rogue attitude completely exposes the true face of imperialism in consistently pursuing a policy of war and aggression, creating international tensions. The "custom" of imperialism, that is, the nature of imperialism, is to dominate the world, enslave the people of all countries, and use all kinds of clever words and absurd and shameless robber logic to cover up and justify this criminal activity. However, the people of the world see the aggressive nature of imperialism clearly. The negative teachers constantly provide new teaching materials, which can only greatly raise the people's awareness, further brighten the people's eyes, and strengthen the world's people's will to fight against imperialism.
    The master walks ahead, and the dog always follows behind. The Nobusuke Kishi clique, following the will of American imperialism, forcibly passed the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty by barbaric means, precisely in accordance with the "custom" of their aggressors, stubbornly to the end, and resolutely hostile to the people.
    Obviously, the nature of a robber is hard to change. American imperialism and its running dogs will always act according to their aggressive "customs." However, what is sad is that they have not seen another kind of "custom," that is, the custom of the people of the world, the inevitable law of historical development. In human history, countless facts have proved that the just and new forces will always defeat the reactionary and decadent forces, and the oppressed and invaded people will surely defeat the reactionaries who oppress and exploit the people. This is an eternal truth. The more frantic imperialism and all reactionaries become, the more they will arouse the anger and resistance of the masses of the people; the more bad things they do, the more the people will not let them go. "As long as imperialism launches a war of aggression, we and the people of the world must wipe them off the face of the earth!" This is the custom of the people of the world to deal with any aggressor. The fate of Hitler and Mussolini can testify to Eisenhower, and the fate of Batista and Syngman Rhee can also testify to Nobusuke Kishi and all the running dogs of imperialism. What awaits American imperialism and its running dogs must be death. This is the real inevitable law of historical development.

    历史的“惯例”
    于静
    5月18日，岸信介在国会安全特别委员会上，为美国的侵略行为百般进行辩护，说了许多恬不知耻的话。最荒谬无耻的是说，在目前国际形势下，“收集情报是全世界的惯例”，“是理所当然”，因此，他同主子“予以协作”，也是“毫无关系的”。
    岸信介搬出来的所谓“惯例”，自然是一种强辞夺理的借口，目的无疑是用这种强盗逻辑为主子辩解，替自己掩丑，对爱好和平的国家反咬一口。“我偷你也偷，彼此彼此，这是惯例”，岸信介以贼之心度人之心，真是无赖到了极点。不过，岸信介的话，对侵略者的真面目确也是一种自我揭露。狗改不了吃屎，黄鼠狼改不了偷鸡，强盗改不了明火暗窃，帝国主义和一切反动派破坏和平，发动战争的侵略本性难移。这正是岸信介所说的一切强盗们的“惯例”。
    其实，岸信介贩卖的这套货色，并不是什么新鲜玩艺儿，只不过是继承了美帝国主义的陈旧衣钵而已。请看，岸信介的主子艾森豪威尔表面上扮演“和平人士”的角色，实际上却蓄谋已久，破坏四国首脑会议，实行假和平、真备战的两面政策，也正是帝国主义者的“惯例”。美国政府的侵略行为遭到苏联和世界人民的严正谴责，艾森豪威尔的和平面具被揭破了，然而他却在声明中坚持说这种侵略活动是“为了保障美国和自由世界的安全”的“必要措施”，表示要继续对苏联进行挑衅活动。甚至，当艾森豪威尔已经达到了破坏四国首脑会议的罪恶目的以后，仍然千方百计地掩盖罪行，勾结他的英、法帝国主义帮凶发表声明，冠冕堂皇地说他们“仍然坚定不移地相信，一切悬而未决的国际问题”都应该通过“和平的方法”来解决。艾森豪威尔一只罪恶的黑手被捉住了，却用另一只涂着白粉的手把橄榄枝摇晃两下。这不过掩耳盗铃的伎俩，这种蛮横无耻的流氓态度，完全暴露了帝国主义一贯奉行战争政策和侵略政策，制造国际紧张局势的真正面目。帝国主义的“惯例”，也就是帝国主义的本性，就是要称霸全世界，奴役各国人民，用种种巧言花语和荒谬无耻的强盗逻辑为这种罪恶活动进行掩饰和辩护。但是，世界人民对帝国主义的侵略本性，是看得一清二楚的。反面教员们不断地提供新教材，只能大大提高人民的觉悟，更加擦亮人民的眼睛，增强世界人民反对帝国主义的斗争意志。
    主子前面走，狗总是尾随其后的。岸信介集团遵循美帝国主义的意志，用野蛮的手段强行通过日美军事同盟条约，也正是按照他们侵略者的“惯例”，顽固到底，坚决与人民为敌。
    显然，强盗的本性难移，美帝国主义和它的走狗们总是要按他们侵略成性的“惯例”行事的。然而，可悲的是，他们却没有看到另外一种“惯例”，就是世界人民的惯例，历史发展的必然规律。在人类历史上，无数的事实证明，正义的新生的力量总是要战胜反动的腐朽的力量，被压迫被侵略的人民一定战胜压迫剥削人民的反动派，这是一条千年不变的真理。帝国主义和一切反动派越是疯狂，就越加激起人民群众的愤怒和反抗；他们越是做坏事，人民就越加不会放过他们。“只要帝国主义发动侵略战争，我们和全世界人民就一定要将它们从地球上消灭干净！”世界人民对付任何侵略者的惯例就是这样。希特勒、墨索里尼的下场可以向艾森豪威尔作证、巴蒂斯塔和李承晚的下场也可以向岸信介和所有帝国主义的走狗作证。等待着美帝国主义和它的走狗的命运，必然是死亡，这才是真正的历史发展的必然规律。
