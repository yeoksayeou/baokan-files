　　Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 19th: TASS reported that Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko sent a telegram on the 19th to the President of the United Nations Security Council, Claude Corea, and the United Nations Secretary-General, Hammarskjöld. The telegram stated that the Soviet government urgently requests a meeting of the Security Council to discuss "the aggressive actions of US military aircraft against the Soviet Union that threaten universal peace."

　　The telegram said that US military aircraft have repeatedly violated Soviet airspace. The US government claims that this practice of violating the borders of other sovereign states is its national policy.

　　The Soviet government pointed out that according to the United Nations Charter, the Security Council bears the primary responsibility for maintaining world peace and security. Therefore, the Soviet government requests the Security Council to immediately discuss the above-mentioned issue and take necessary measures to end the provocative actions of the United States that endanger world peace.

　　Accompanying the telegram was a note. The note pointed out that the actions of US aircraft intruding into Soviet airspace with hostile intentions towards the Soviet Union are "incompatible with the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter."

　　The note said that such provocative actions by the United States pose a great danger to the cause of peace. "As everyone knows, with US bombers carrying atomic and hydrogen bombs frequently flying, including towards the Soviet border, there is no guarantee that US aircraft intruding into Soviet territory are not carrying such destructive materials. In this situation, the Soviet Union may naturally face the necessity of taking retaliatory measures to defend its own security and repel aggression, in which case the responsibility for the consequences will fall entirely on the government of the country that commits aggression against other countries."

　　The note said, "Irrefutable facts prove that the actions taken by the United States are premeditated and meticulously prepared." It can be seen from the statements of the US government that the provocative actions of US aircraft against the Soviet Union are the established policy of the US government, and the statement made by US President Eisenhower in Paris shows that the US government does not intend to change this policy.

　　The note said, "The Soviet government believes that it is the direct obligation of the Security Council to firmly condemn the actions of the United States that endanger the cause of peace and to demand that US Air Force aircraft cease violating the airspace of other countries. If such acts of rampage and provocation in international relations are not stopped, the United Nations will have failed to fulfill its obligations to the people of all countries."

　　The note finally emphasized, "Out of concern for maintaining universal peace, the Soviet government believes it has a responsibility to raise the issue of 'the aggressive actions of US military aircraft against the Soviet Union that threaten universal peace,' requesting the Security Council to discuss it immediately, and hoping that the Security Council will take measures without delay to stop the actions of the United States that endanger the cause of peace."

　　Xinhua News Agency, 20th: New York news: The United Nations Secretariat announced on the afternoon of the 19th that, at the request of the Soviet government, it has decided to hold a meeting of the United Nations Security Council on the afternoon of May 23 to discuss "the aggressive actions of US military aircraft against the Soviet Union that threaten universal peace."

### 苏联政府照会安理会  要求制止美国的侵略行动

    苏联政府照会安理会
    要求制止美国的侵略行动
    新华社20日讯　据塔斯社巴黎19日讯：苏联外交部长葛罗米柯19日打电报给联合国安全理事会主席克劳德·科里亚和联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德。电报说，苏联政府紧急要求召开安理会会议来讨论“关于美国军用飞机对苏联进行了对普遍和平造成威胁的侵略行动”的问题。
    电报说，美国军用飞机一再侵犯苏联领空。美国政府声称，这种侵犯其他主权国家边境的作法是它的国家政策。
    苏联政府指出，根据联合国宪章，安全理事会要对维护世界和平和安全负主要责任，所以苏联政府要求安全理事会立刻讨论上述问题和采取必要措施来结束危及世界和平的美国的挑衅行动。
    随同电报一起发出的还有一份照会。照会指出，美国飞机抱着敌视苏联的目的侵入苏联领空的作法是同“联合国宪章的原则和宗旨不相符的”。
    照会说，美国的这种挑衅行动对和平事业具有巨大的危险。“正如大家知道的，在载有原子弹和氢弹的美国轰炸机经常飞行、其中包括向苏联国境方向飞行的情况下，不能担保侵入苏联国境的美国飞机没有装载这种毁灭性的东西。在这种情况下，苏联自然可能面临这样的必要性：采取报复措施以保卫自己的安全和击退侵略，在这种情况下，后果的责任完全要由对其他国家进行侵略的国家的政府担负。”
    照会说，“无可辩驳的事实证明，美国所干的这种行动是预谋的、经过周密准备的。”从美国政府的声明中可以看出，美国飞机对苏联的挑衅行动是美国政府的既定政策，而且美国总统艾森豪威尔在巴黎发表的声明表明，美国政府不打算改变这种政策。
    照会说，“苏联政府认为，坚决谴责美国危及和平事业的行动，要求停止美国空军的飞机侵犯其他国家领空，是安全理事会的直接义务。如果不制止国际关系中的这种横行霸道和挑衅手段，联合国就没有履行它对各国人民的义务。”
    照会最后着重指出，“苏联政府出于对维护普遍和平的关怀，认为有责任提出‘关于美国军用飞机对苏联进行了对普遍和平造成威胁的侵略行动’的问题，请安全理事会立即讨论，并且希望安全理事会毫不拖延地采取措施来制止美国危及和平事业的行动”。
    新华社20日讯　纽约消息：联合国秘书处19日下午宣布，应苏联政府的要求，决定在5月23日下午举行联合国安全理事会会议，讨论“关于美国军用飞机对苏联进行了对普遍和平造成威胁的侵略行动”的问题。
