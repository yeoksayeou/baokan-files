Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 18th: The Fourth Plenary Session of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, which opened in Lhasa on April 22, successfully concluded on the 13th after twenty-two days.

Acting Chairman Panchen Erdeni delivered a closing speech, saying, "This meeting, which lasted for more than twenty days, was very good and successful. The meeting summarized the work of 1959, which was of great historical significance and achieved a decisive victory in democratic reform, arranged the work tasks for thoroughly completing democratic reform in 1960, reviewed and approved the final financial accounts of the Tibet region for 1959 and the financial budget for 1960, and listened to the political report of Zhang Guohua, Deputy Secretary of the Tibet Working Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Autonomous Region. The committee members and delegates attending the meeting conducted earnest and enthusiastic discussions on the above-mentioned reports, fully promoted democracy, spoke freely, and carried out criticism and self-criticism. The meeting was filled with an atmosphere of unity, progress, and revolution from beginning to end. The representatives of the working people happily expressed their joyful mood and revolutionary vigor after the liberation of millions of serfs."

Panchen Erdeni hoped that the committee members and delegates would bring the spirit of the resolutions of this conference to all regions and convey it to every corner and every person, transform it into the actual actions of all Tibetan people, and transform it into a huge force for building a new democratic and socialist Tibet.

The conference adopted the "Resolution on the Summary of Work of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region in 1959 and the Work Tasks for 1960," the "Resolution on the Final Financial Accounts of the Tibet Region for 1959 and the Financial Budget for 1960," and a message of sympathy to the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet.

In the "Resolution on the Summary of Work of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region in 1959 and the Work Tasks for 1960," it said: "The Fourth Plenary Session of the Committee unanimously agreed with the report made by Acting Chairman Panchen Erdeni on the summary of the work of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region in 1959 and the work tasks for 1960. The meeting believes that the changes that occurred in the Tibet region in 1959 were epoch-making and fundamental changes. This change once again proves that all reactionaries and exploiting classes are bound to perish. The working people and all progressive forces are bound to win. This is the law of historical development."

The resolution expressed satisfaction with the achievements made in various tasks and construction projects in Tibet under the new situation last year.

The resolution pointed out that the work in 1960, on the basis of the victory of the work in 1959, must continue to mobilize the masses in depth, thoroughly complete democratic reform, consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, develop agricultural and pastoral production, and ensure a bumper harvest this year. To this end, we must resolutely implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, we must achieve technological innovation and technological revolution, we must vigorously consolidate, develop and improve mutual aid teams, strengthen leadership over mutual aid teams, and launch a patriotic production increase movement centered on mutual aid and cooperation.

The resolution calls on all Tibetan people, under the wise and correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for building socialism, and inspired by the excellent situation in the country and Tibet, to adhere to putting politics in command and ideological leadership, unite as one, go all out, thoroughly complete democratic reform, and strive to build a new democratic and socialist Tibet. The conference also passed a resolution to remove the member of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, Mo Lin·Awang Quezha, a traitor, and supplement Zhou Renshan and Suo Nam Zhuoma as members of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region. Zhou Renshan was also appointed as a standing committee member. In addition, due to Mu Shengzhong's transfer from Tibet, the meeting decided to remove him from his position as a member of the Preparatory Committee.
