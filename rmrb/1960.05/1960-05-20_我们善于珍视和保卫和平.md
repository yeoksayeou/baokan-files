We Are Good at Cherishing and Defending Peace
(Soviet Union) A. Surkov

The anger in my heart is stronger than a strike!
My song, like an alarm bell, rings out!
Desperate hatred thickens the dirty clouds
Of that vile “cold war.”
This bandit, an uninvited guest, invades
The peaceful skies of our motherland.
A vulture spreads its wings,
A high-flying robber breaks in from foreign borders.
Our keen and vigilant sentries
Shoot down this ominous evil bird, smashing it to pieces!

That day in the Soviet Union, from border to border,
Red flags fluttered, songs echoed,
The people's ranks marched with strong strides,
Welcoming the sun of "May Day."
The labor guards advanced with chests held high,
The grand army of communism marched forward mightily,
No one can ever drive such people
Back to those shameful days that are gone forever.
We hold the fiery red flag high,
Who dares to drag us back into the hell of darkness!
Listen! The storm is roaring:
--Dog robbers, get out of our country!
This sound is like an earth-shattering bronze bell,
This sound comes from the lungs of all mankind.
Millions upon millions of mouths shout in unison!
        --Don't play with fire in this grave hour!
Our motherland is as solid as steel,
The people's hands are strong and powerful,
They defend the peaceful skies of the motherland,
From the invasion of uninvited guests.

  Lenin taught us to treat each other with friendship,
  We are good at cherishing and defending peace,
  But, if anyone comes with a knife and sword,
  We also have sharp swords inserted in our scabbards.

  The anger in my heart is stronger than a strike!
  My song, like an alarm bell, rings out!

    我们善于珍视和保卫和平
    （苏联）　阿·苏尔科夫心头的愤怒，比撞击更强烈！我的歌呵，像报警的钟声响起！绝望的仇恨又在加浓那肮脏的“冷战”阴云。这匪贼不速之客，侵犯我们祖国和平的天空。兀鹫展开了双翅，高飞的强盗由异国的边境闯进。我们敏锐而惊醒的哨岗，打得这不祥的恶鸟倒栽粉身！那天在苏联，从边疆到边疆，红旗飘飘，歌声荡漾，人民的队伍迈着雄健的步伐，迎着“五一节”的太阳。劳动近卫军挺胸向前，共产主义的大军浩浩荡荡地前进，任凭是谁永远不能把这样的人们，逐回那一去不返的可耻的岁月。我们把火红的旗帜高高举起，哪个胆敢再把我们拖入黑暗的地狱！听吧！风暴在呼啸：——狗强盗从我国滚出去！这声音犹如动地惊天的铜钟，这声音发自全人类的肺腑。千千万万张口齐声怒喊！
                ——不许在严峻的时刻把战火玩弄！我们祖国像钢铁的磐石一般坚固，人民的双手强壮而有力，他们保卫着祖国和平的天空，免遭不速之客的侵袭。
  列宁教导我们友好相待，
  我们善于珍视和保卫和平，
  但是，谁如果抱刀携剑而来，
  在我们鞘里也插着磨快了的
      利剑。
  心头的愤怒，比撞击更强烈！
  我的歌呵，像报警的钟声响
      起！（原载1960年5月7日苏联真理报）
