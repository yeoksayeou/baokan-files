Spring Thunder
    ——Dedicated to the Heroic People of Turkey

	Was it the roaring waves of the Han River that startled you awake, or was it the fire of anger in your hearts that could not be calmed? Turkish brothers, you have finally roared, like a spring thunder striking against the endless winter night! Beautiful Lake Van, I hear you weeping day and night, white-haired Mount Ararat, I hear you sighing all year round! A hundred military bases are like a hundred heavy chains, tightly binding your land, trampling it underfoot! How can these days of blood and tears continue? Rise up in struggle! Only struggle, only rise up! Drive away those Washington jackals embracing missiles, drive away that American running dog – Menderes! You shout "Freedom", raise the banner of fighting for freedom, let blood be spilled all over the streets, let the earth be filled with seeds, Turkish brothers, you will surely reap a spring, the earth will be covered with flame-like flowers, in thousands of reds and purples…

(Note) Lake Van is the largest lake in Turkey, and Mount Ararat is the highest mountain in Turkey.

    春雷
    ——献给英勇的土耳其人民
    程光锐是汉江上的狂涛把你们惊起，还是你们的胸中怒火不能平息？土耳其兄弟，你们终于怒吼了，像一阵春雷朝着无尽的冬夜冲击！美丽的凡湖呵，我听见你日夜哭泣，白发的阿拉拉特，我听见你终年叹息！百十个军事基地像百十条沉重的锁链，把你们的国土紧紧捆绑，踏在脚底！这血泪的日子怎能够再过下去？奋起斗争！只有斗争，只有奋起！赶走那些怀抱导弹的华盛顿豺狼，赶走那条美国走狗——曼德列斯！你们高呼“自由”，高举争自由的旗帜，让鲜血洒遍街头，让大地布满种籽，土耳其兄弟，你们一定会收获一个春天，大地上将开遍火焰般的鲜花，千红万紫……
    （注）凡湖是土耳其境内最大的湖，阿拉拉特山是土耳其境内最高的山。
