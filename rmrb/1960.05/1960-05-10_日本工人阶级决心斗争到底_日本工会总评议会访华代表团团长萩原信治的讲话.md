Dear Chinese friends!

On behalf of the Japanese working class, I would like to express my deep gratitude and working-class solidarity to you for holding such a grand and meaningful rally to support our Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance.

Comrades, brothers! As you all know, U.S. imperialism and Nobusuke Kishi not only do not reflect on their responsibility for the Second World War, but also concluded a military alliance that undermines world peace, attempting to drag the Japanese people into war.

The U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" signed by U.S. imperialism and Nobusuke Kishi is an aggressive military alliance hostile to the Chinese people, Asian countries, and all peace-loving people in the world.

This fact has been clearly demonstrated by Kishi Nobusuke himself in his replies in the Diet.

During the Second World War, the militarists made Japan commit many crimes against many countries, especially countless crimes against the Chinese people.

At the same time, the Japanese people themselves were forced to suffer many sacrifices. After suffering these many sacrifices, although the banner of democracy and peace was raised over the heads of the Japanese people, Kishi Nobusuke soon began to prepare for war again.

Kishi Nobusuke is one of the persons responsible for the Second World War and a war criminal. This war person responsible, Kishi Nobusuke, is a common enemy of the people of China and Japan, and a promoter of war policies in collusion with U.S. imperialism.

The Japanese working class is firmly determined to wage a resolute struggle against such vicious U.S. imperialism and the Kishi Nobusuke group.

The struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance is a struggle that determines the fate of the Japanese people, and we are doing our best to carry out this struggle. At the same time, this struggle is not only a struggle of the Japanese people, but also a struggle that must be crushed by the unified and united action of the people of the world, because this military alliance is hostile to the people of Asian countries and the world.

Why? Because imperialism is often supported not only by the reactionaries of one country, but also by the reactionaries parasitizing capitalist countries, with U.S. imperialism as the pivot.

Therefore, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan requests assistance from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea.

In response, the comrades in China and Korea gave our appeal warm support and issued a joint statement of historical significance.

This joint statement has received widespread support from more than a dozen countries in Asia and Africa and is developing towards international united action.

At present, the Japanese struggle against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" has entered an extremely important stage.

Kishi Nobusuke ignores the Japanese people's call for peace and the strong desire for peace of the Chinese people and Asian countries, and attempts to forcibly pass this U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" in the Japanese Diet.

However, if Kishi Nobusuke ignores the Japanese people's desire for peace and forcibly passes this U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" in the Diet, then Kishi Nobusuke himself is digging his own grave.

Friends:

The Japanese people firmly declare: they will never fight the Chinese people again.

However, the Japanese people will fight to the end against those who undermine peace, suppress workers, and trample on the people's lives.

Chinese brothers!

Please lodge a serious protest with the Kishi Nobusuke reactionary group, which is colluding with U.S. imperialism.

Furthermore, please give a serious warning to Kishi Nobusuke and Japanese monopoly capital based on the historical law that "war-mongers will be executed by the people."

Finally, I would like to express my gratitude once again for the strong support given by the Chinese people.

Long live the unity and unified action of the workers of China and Japan!

### 日本工人阶级决心斗争到底  日本工会总评议会访华代表团团长萩原信治的讲话

    日本工人阶级决心斗争到底
    日本工会总评议会访华代表团团长萩原信治的讲话亲爱的中国朋友们！
    我代表日本工人阶级，谨向你们为支援我们日本人民反对日美军事同盟的斗争，举行这样盛大的、有意义的集会，致以深深的谢意和工人阶级团结的敬意。
    同志们，兄弟们！大家知道，美帝国主义和岸信介不仅不反省它们对第二次世界大战应负的责任，而且又缔结破坏世界和平的军事同盟，企图把日本人民拖入战争中。
    美帝国主义和岸信介所签订的日美“安全条约”，是敌视中国人民、敌视亚洲各国和全世界爱好和平人民的侵略性的军事同盟。
    这一事实，已被岸信介自己在国会上的答辩证明得清清楚楚。
    在第二次世界大战中，军国主义者使日本对许多国家犯下了许许多多的罪恶，尤其是对中国人民犯下了无数的罪恶。
    同时也迫使日本人民自己遭到了许多牺牲。在遭到这许多牺牲之后，虽然在日本人民头上升起了民主与和平的旗帜，但不久，岸信介又开始准备战争了。
    岸信介是第二次世界大战的负责人之一，是个战犯。这个战争负责人岸信介，是日中两国人民的共同敌人，是与美帝国主义相勾结的战争政策的推行者。
    日本工人阶级有坚强的决心，与这样恶毒的美帝国主义和岸信介集团进行坚决的斗争。
    反对日美军事同盟的斗争是决定日本人民命运的斗争，我们正在全力以赴地进行着这一斗争。同时，这一斗争不仅是日本人民的斗争，而且因为这个军事同盟是敌视亚洲各国和全世界人民的，所以又是必须以全世界人民统一团结的行动来粉碎它的斗争。
    为什么？因为帝国主义往往不仅受一个国家的反动派的支持，而是以美帝国主义为枢纽，受着寄生在资本主义各国的反动派的支持。
    因此，日本总评要求中华全国总工会及朝鲜职业总同盟给予协助。
    对此，中国及朝鲜的同志们对我们的呼吁给予了热烈的支持，并发表了富有历史意义的联合声明。
    这个联合声明，已得到了亚非十几个国家的广泛的支持，正在向着国际的团结行动发展。
    目前，日本反对日美“安全条约”的斗争，已经进入了极为重要的阶段。
    岸信介忽视日本人民要求和平的呼声，并忽视中国人民及亚洲各国对和平的强烈愿望，企图在日本国会上强行通过这个日美“安全条约”。
    但是，如果岸信介忽视日本人民对和平的愿望而在国会中强行通过这个日美“安全条约”的话，就是岸信介自己为自己在掘坟墓。
    朋友们：
    日本人民坚决表示：决不再与中国人民作战。
    但是，日本人民要与破坏和平、镇压工人及蹂躏人民生活的人斗争到底。
    中国兄弟们！
    请你们向与美帝国主义相勾结的岸信介反动集团提出严重抗议。
    并且，请你们根据“战争贩子必将被人民所处决”的历史规律，向岸信介和日本垄断资本提出严重警告。
    最后，我对中国人民所给予的强有力的支援，再一次地表示感谢。
    日中两国工人的团结与统一行动万岁！
