    Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 15th. Today, more than 300,000 people in Hefei, Anhui Province, held a rally and demonstration, resolutely opposing the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and firmly supporting the Japanese people's just struggle against the U.S. and for patriotism.
    In the second year after the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, Hefei City was subjected to a brutal bombing by Japanese militarist planes. At that time, the most prosperous Anqing Road was bombed into rubble, and the fire burned for a whole day, with many people dying under the indiscriminate bombing. Yuan Tingliang, a slaughterhouse worker, had his third younger brother, Yuan Tinglong, killed by the bombing, and his fourth younger brother, Yuan Tingfeng, who had been married for only four months, was shot by the Japanese bandits, destroying a good family. Zhu Yanying, a 55-year-old woman from the Iron and Steel New Village Residents' Committee, had her leg blown off by a Japanese plane when she was 33 years old. She said: "I gnash my teeth with hatred at the mention of Japanese imperialism. We will never allow Japanese militarism to come and destroy our peaceful and happy life again." Today, she resolutely asked others to push her on a flatbed truck to participate in the rally and demonstration, and she kept waving her fist and shouting: "Oppose the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty!" "Oppose the revival of Japanese militarism!" Wu Yikai, an old worker from the Hefei Mining Machinery Factory who had suffered from Japanese imperialism, angrily denounced: "Japanese imperialism didn't treat the Chinese people as human beings. Once, the Japanese invading army forced me to eat the phlegm I spat on the ground." He then rolled up his trouser leg and pointed to the scar from being bitten by a Japanese wolfhound, saying: "I will never forget the hatred of Japanese imperialism's invasion of China. Now the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries are engaging in a military alliance in an attempt to invade China and destroy our peaceful and happy life. The Chinese people have stood up, and if the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries dare to invade again, we have a powerful force and will definitely beat them until they are battered and bloody."
    The conference today was originally expected to have 200,000 people participating, but by the time it started at 2:00 p.m., the number of participants had increased to 300,000. Some people who were passing through Hefei also actively participated in the rally and demonstration. The salespersons of various stores, the waiters of restaurants, the ticket sellers of buses, etc., all became propagandists for supporting the Japanese people's just struggle today, and the people in every corner of the city were thrown into the torrent of supporting the Japanese people's just struggle. People carried slogans and cartoon placards, shouted slogans, and sang songs such as "Unity is Strength," "Oppose Arming Japan," and "The Pacific Ocean Must Always Be Peaceful," and poured into the venue of the conference—the Sports Square—from the streets and alleys.
    Zeng Xisheng, First Secretary of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Huang Yan, Secretary of the Secretariat and Governor of the Province, and heads of various people's organizations and local organizations of various democratic parties, all attended the meeting.
    Wu Wenrui, member of the Standing Committee of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Minister of the Propaganda Department, spoke at the meeting. He said: The power of the people is powerful and invincible. No matter how ferocious the U.S. imperialism and Japanese reactionaries are, and no matter how they play tricks and schemes, they will inevitably suffer a shameful and miserable defeat in the face of the great power of the people.
    The conference finally passed a telegram from the people of Anhui Province and Hefei City supporting the Japanese people in opposing the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.

    Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, 15th. The people of Qingdao, Shandong Province, who had been ruled by German, Japanese, and American imperialists, held a rally and demonstration today with 150,000 people participating, resolutely supporting the Japanese people's just struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.
    Workers, farmers, students, members of urban communes, cadres of government offices, officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, and militiamen participated in the rally and demonstration.
    Song Xinglu, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Qingdao Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, said at the meeting that Japanese and American imperialism had successively occupied Qingdao, many compatriots were brutally killed, and people's lives were miserable. We will never forget these blood feuds. Today, we liberated people will never allow U.S. imperialism to support the resurgence of Japanese militarism.
    The conference finally passed a telegram.

    血海深仇誓不忘
    合肥青岛人民控诉美日反动派罪行
    据新华社合肥15日电　安徽省合肥市今天有三十多万人民举行集会和示威游行，坚决反对日美军事同盟条约，坚决支援日本人民反美爱国的正义斗争。
    合肥市在抗日战争爆发的第二年，遭到日本军国主义飞机的残酷轰炸，当时最繁华的安庆路被炸成一片瓦砾，大火整整烧了一天，很多人死于狂轰滥炸之下。屠宰工人袁廷梁的三弟袁廷龙被炸死，他的刚新婚四个月的四弟袁廷凤被日寇枪杀，好好的一个家庭就这样被拆毁。钢铁新村居民委员会五十五岁的老太太朱燕英，三十三岁时被日本飞机炸断了腿，她说：我一听到日本帝国主义，就恨得咬牙切齿，我们绝不再让日本军国主义再来破坏我们的和平幸福生活。今天，她坚决要求别人用平板车推着她参加了集会游行，她不时地挥着拳头高呼：“反对日美军事同盟条约！”、“反对复活日本军国主义！”。曾经遭受日本帝国主义残害的合肥矿山机械厂老工人吴怡恺，愤怒地控诉说：“日本帝国主义把中国人民不当人看待，有一次日本侵略军逼迫我把吐在地下的痰吃到肚里。”他又卷起裤腿指着被日本狼狗咬的伤疤说：“我永远不会忘记日本帝国主义侵略中国的仇恨，现在美日反动派又搞军事同盟企图侵略中国，想破坏我们和平幸福的生活，我们中国人民已经站起来了，美日反动派胆敢再来侵略，我们有强大的力量，一定把它打得头破血流”。
    今天的大会原来预计有二十万人参加，但到下午二时开会时，参加的人数已增至三十万人。一些因公路过合肥的人也都踊跃地参加了集会游行。全市各个商店的营业员、饭店的服务员、公共汽车的售票员等，今天都成了支援日本人民正义斗争的宣传员，全市各个角落的人民都投入支援日本人民正义斗争的洪流。人们抬着标语漫画牌，高呼着口号，唱着“团结就是力量”、“反对武装日本”、“太平洋要永远太平”等歌曲，从大街小巷拥向大会会场——体育广场。
    中共安徽省委第一书记曾希圣，书记处书记、省长黄岩等党政负责人，各人民团体和各民主党派地方组织的负责人，都出席了大会。
    中共安徽省委常委、宣传部部长吴文瑞在会上讲话。他说：人民的力量是强大无比的，是不可战胜的，不管美帝国主义和日本反动派怎样凶恶，怎样玩弄阴谋花样，都必将在人民的巨大力量面前遭到可耻的惨败。
    大会最后通过了安徽省和合肥市各界人民支援日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的通电。
    据新华社青岛15日电　曾经遭受过德、日、美等帝国主义统治的山东省青岛市人民，今天举行了有十五万人参加的集会和示威游行，坚决支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的正义斗争。
    参加集会和示威游行的有工人、农民、学生、城市公社社员、机关干部、解放军官兵和民兵等。
    中共青岛市委书记处书记宋星路在大会上说，日美帝国主义曾先后占领过青岛，许多同胞惨遭屠杀，人民生活苦不堪言。这些血海深仇，我们永远不会忘记。今天我们解放了的人民，决不容许美帝国主义扶植日本军国主义东山再起。
    大会最后通过了通电。
