Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou. Henan Province is seeing a widespread promotion of cast iron pot-type water lifting machine manufacturing by industrial departments at all levels, vigorously supporting agricultural technical transformation. The province plans to manufacture 200,000 cast iron pot-type water lifting machines with a total of 700,000 horsepower before the flood season; added to the existing and planned production of power machinery, this will enable Henan's rural areas to basically achieve mechanization of water conservancy irrigation and drainage.

The workers Zhou Tiechi, Fan Canzhang, Hu Baoshan, and all staff of the Xuchang Special District Machinery Factory, under the direct guidance and encouragement of the Xuchang District Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, synthesized the advantages of steam engines made in Fugou and Pingdingshan cities. Through hard work and perseverance, and after dozens of failures, they successfully trial-produced a 2.8-horsepower cast iron pot-type water lifting machine. This type of water lifting machine has many advantages: the manufacturing technology is simple, and any county or commune machinery factory with casting capabilities can manufacture it; the materials are easy to obtain, with each cast iron pot-type water lifting machine requiring only half a ton of pig iron; the fuel is widely available, and coal, wood, sorghum stalks, etc., can be burned in the boiler; the work efficiency is high, it can operate continuously, pumping 40 cubic meters of water per hour at a 10-meter head, and can irrigate 30 mu of land per day; it is easy to use, and can be operated by a semi-labor force; and its uses are wide, as it can not only pump water for irrigation but also be used as power machinery for milling flour, generating electricity, and processing agricultural and sideline products. Therefore, the production of the cast iron pot-type water lifting machine not only provides good conditions for the early realization of water conservancy irrigation and drainage mechanization but also opens up broad avenues for accelerating the realization of agricultural mechanization.

In order to rapidly promote the widespread use of cast iron pot-type water lifting machines throughout the province, the Henan Provincial People's Committee recently held an on-site meeting on cast iron pot-type water lifting machines in Xuchang City, summarizing the advantages of the machines, deciding to vigorously organize promotion throughout the province, and formulating a production plan for them. Currently, many counties and cities have established promotion committees and headquarters, strengthening specific leadership, organizing cadres to go deep into factories to provide concrete assistance in trial production, and extensively mobilizing the masses to study, promote, create, reform, and break through ideological, technical, material, and equipment barriers, thereby rapidly launching a mass campaign to manufacture cast iron pot-type water lifting machines throughout the province. The Xuchang Special District organized 216 county and commune machinery factories and 6,700 workers to engage in manufacturing work, producing 322 cast iron pot-type water lifting machines in just one month.

The large-scale promotion of cast iron pot-type water lifting machines has powerfully supported the current campaign to universally water wheat during the jointing stage. Yuxian and Baofeng counties use cast iron pot-type water lifting machines to drive waterwheels, irrigating 4.2 mu of land per hour, or 100 mu of land per day, increasing efficiency by more than 20 times compared to animal traction. Xihua, Yuxian, and other counties also use them to drive lathes, grind flour, cook food, and cut vegetables, greatly reducing the labor intensity of commune members and improving work efficiency.

    河南掀起大造铸铁锅驼机高潮
    全省计划在汛期前制造铸铁锅驼机二十万台共七十万马力
    据新华社郑州电　河南省各地工业部门正在普遍推广制造铸铁锅驼机，大力支援农业技术改造。全省计划在汛期前制造铸铁锅驼机二十万台共七十万马力；加上原有的和已安排生产的动力机械，这样就可以使河南农村基本实现水利排灌机械化。
    许昌专区机械厂工人周铁池、樊灿章、胡宝山等和全体职工，在中共许昌地委的直接指导和鼓励下，综合了扶沟、平顶山市制成的蒸汽机的优点，艰苦奋斗，不屈不挠，经过数十次失败，试制成功了二点八马力铸铁锅驼机。这种锅驼机具有很多优点：制造技术简单，只要能翻砂的县社机械厂就可以制造；材料容易解决，每个铸铁锅驼机，只需半吨生铁；燃料广，煤、木材、秫秸等都可烧锅炉；工效高，能连续运转，十米扬程每小时能抽水四十立方，每天可浇地三十亩；好使用，半劳力也可以操作；用途广，既能抽水浇地，又能用来作为磨面、发电、加工农副产品的动力机械。因此，铸铁锅驼机的制成，不仅为提前实现水利排灌机械化提供了良好的条件，而且为加速实现农业机械化开辟了广阔途径。
    为了使铸铁锅驼机迅速在全省普遍推广使用，河南省人民委员会最近在许昌市召开了铸铁锅驼机现场会议，总结了铸铁锅驼机的优点，决定在全省大力组织推广，并且制订了铸铁锅驼机生产规划。现在，许多县、市建立了推广委员会和指挥部，加强了具体领导，组织干部深入工厂具体帮助试制，并且广泛发动群众大学、大推、大创、大改，大破思想、技术、材料、设备关，从而在全省范围内迅速掀起了群众性的铸铁锅驼机制造高潮。许昌专区组织了二百一十六个县、社机械厂和六千七百名工人投入了制造工作，在短短的一个月时间内就生产了铸铁锅驼机三百二十二台。
    铸铁锅驼机的大量推广，有力地支持了目前小麦普浇拔节水运动。禹县、宝丰等县用铸铁锅驼机带动水车，每小时浇地四点二亩，一昼夜浇地一百亩，比牲口拉提高效率二十多倍。西华、禹县等县还用它带动车床、磨面、做饭、切菜，大大减轻了社员的劳动强度，提高了工作效率。
