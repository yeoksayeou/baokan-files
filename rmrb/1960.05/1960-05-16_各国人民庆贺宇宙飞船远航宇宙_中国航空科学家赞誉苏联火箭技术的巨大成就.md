Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 15th. The news of the successful launch of a satellite-spaceship by the Soviet Union spread here this morning, immediately arousing enthusiastic cheers from the broad masses of working people. They are all proud of this new achievement of Soviet science and technology.

    Timofeevich, Deputy Chairman of the Astronomical Committee of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, said that the launch of this satellite-spaceship is paving the way for the realization of human spaceflight. The fantasy of humans achieving spaceflight is about to become a reality. The Soviet Union's artificial satellites are all thoroughly prepared and are becoming more and more complex. The sealed cabin on the satellite-spaceship will detach from the satellite-spaceship according to ground commands, which is the central problem in solving human spaceflight. Because only when the problem of returning to Earth is solved can human spaceflight be realized.

    Karpov, a worker at the Likhachev Automobile Factory in Moscow, said that all the workers in their factory were very excited after hearing the news this morning. This worker said that the Soviet Union's launch of a satellite-spaceship once again shows the world the new achievements of Soviet science and technology. Karpov said that the Soviet people are engaged in peaceful labor, and Soviet scientists are also dedicated to studying the conquest of the universe. But if someone attempts to disrupt our peaceful labor, then the Soviet people will give the aggressors a fatal blow.

Xinhua News Agency, May 15th. Tokyo dispatch: After the news of the Soviet Union's successful launch of a spaceship-satellite reached Japan, newspapers, radio stations, and scientists praised the great achievements of Soviet science.

    Japanese newspapers all reported the startling news from TASS about the successful launch of the spaceship-satellite on the front pages of their evening editions with huge headlines.

    After reporting the news, Japanese radio stations also broadcast a statement by Takeo Hatanaka, a professor at Tokyo University and a famous physicist. Hatanaka said that he was amazed by the great weight of the Soviet spaceship-satellite. Hatanaka also believes that the day when humans realize space travel is getting closer.

Xinhua News Agency, May 15th. After the Soviet Union launched a satellite-spaceship, Chinese aviation scientists enthusiastically welcomed this great scientific achievement of the Soviet Union. The Beijing Institute of Aeronautics held a symposium that afternoon. Wu Guang, President of the Aviation Institute, Associate Professors Zhang Xisheng, Dong Shoushen, Wen Chuanyuan, He Qingzhi, Zhao Zhenyan and others participated in the symposium.

    Zhang Xisheng said that the Soviet Union's launch of a giant satellite-spaceship this time is to conquer nature and benefit mankind, while the United States uses U-2 type aircraft for war purposes. This is a sharp contrast between the two fundamentally different systems of socialism and capitalism. The Soviet Union's launch of a satellite-spaceship this time is exactly the second anniversary of the Soviet Union's launch of the third artificial satellite. In just two years, the thrust of Soviet rockets has increased more than threefold. This is the first thing that makes people feel encouraged by this launch.

    Secondly, this giant spaceship is controllable, which creates extremely important conditions for future manned flight back to Earth. It can be affirmed that the Soviet Union is creating extremely important conditions for the safe landing of the spaceship in a designated area.

    Thirdly, since the successful launch of the Soviet Union's first artificial Earth satellite on October 4, 1957, three satellites, three space rockets, two multi-stage ballistic rockets and even today's satellite-spaceship have all been carried out according to plan, each heavier than the other and more precise than the other, while the United States is just the opposite. Not only is the weight far inferior to that of the Soviet Union, but it has also failed many times. These two facts precisely show that the distance between the United States' science and the Soviet Union's is getting bigger and bigger. We believe that the success of this launch by the Soviet Union has created an important beginning for human spaceflight.

    Wen Chuanyuan said that the orbit of the satellite-spaceship launched by the Soviet Union this time is close to circular, which is an important achievement in control technology. The satellite-spaceship can descend according to ground instructions, which lays the foundation for the safe landing necessary for returning people to Earth.

    In addition, this flight will surely measure richer data for science. These data can more correctly identify the research results of scientists.

    Zhao Zhenyan believes that the success of the Soviet Union's launch of the satellite-spaceship this time is the inevitable result of the successful launch of the Pacific rocket last time. This time, 1,477 kilograms of instruments were installed on the spaceship, which exceeds the weight of instruments on past satellites or space rockets, and a "dummy" was also installed, so that more data can be measured than in the past, indicating that the era of humans entering spaceflight is not far away. The orbit of the satellite-spaceship is close to circular, which means that the control of the magnitude and direction of the speed must be quite accurate.

    Preliminary estimates are that the take-off thrust of the satellite-spaceship is about 1,000 tons. This is a major victory for Soviet rocket technology. Because such a large thrust places very high demands on the structure and materials of the rocket itself.

    The satellite-spaceship is controllable and can descend according to ground instructions. It is estimated that the spaceship is also equipped with controllable reverse thrust engines, and this is one of the important technical conditions for humans to make space flights. The Soviet Union's launch of the satellite-spaceship this time forms a sharp contrast with the failure of the United States to launch a "balloon satellite" on the 13th of this month. The United States' attempt to launch this satellite was to broadcast Eisenhower's speech, but it was still unsuccessful. The Soviet Union is creating conditions for humans to make space flights. This is a contrast between two completely different purposes; and in the contrast of rocket technology, it is simply incomparable who is superior and who is inferior.

    Dong Shoushen said that since the Soviet Union launched the first artificial Earth satellite on October 4, 1957, it has only been two and a half years, and the speed of the Soviet Union's progress in rocket technology is amazing. If the first-stage rocket engine this time is composed of four engines, then the thrust of each engine is about 250 tons. However, the maximum thrust of the American rocket engine is only about 75 tons. The Soviet Union has reached an extremely perfect level in rocket technology.

    各国人民庆贺宇宙飞船远航宇宙
    中国航空科学家赞誉苏联火箭技术的巨大成就
    新华社莫斯科15日电　苏联成功发射卫星式飞船的消息今天早晨在这里传开以后，马上引起了广大劳动人民的热烈欢呼。他们一致为这一苏联科学技术新的成就而骄傲。
    苏联科学院天文学委员会副主席季莫费耶维奇说，这一卫星式飞船的发射是为实现人类的宇宙飞行开辟道路。人类实现宇宙飞行的这件幻想即将变成现实。苏联放射人造卫星都是经过充分准备的，并且一个比一个复杂。卫星式飞船上的密封舱将按照地上的命令而脱离开卫星式飞船，这是解决人类宇宙飞行的中心问题。因为只有解决了返回地球的问题时，人类的宇宙飞行才能实现。
    莫斯科利哈乔夫汽车工厂工人卡尔波夫说，他们工厂全体工人今天早晨听到了这件消息以后都非常兴奋。这位工人说，苏联发射卫星式飞船再次向全世界表明了苏联科学技术的新成就。卡尔波夫说，苏联人民都在从事着和平劳动，苏联科学家也在致力于研究征服宇宙的问题。但是如果有人企图破坏我们的和平劳动，那么苏联人民将给予侵略者以致命的打击。
    新华社15日讯　东京消息：苏联宇宙飞船卫星发射成功的消息传到日本后，报纸、电台和科学家纷纷赞扬苏联科学的伟大成就。
    日本各家报纸都在今天晚刊上以头版的巨大篇幅报道了塔斯社关于宇宙飞船卫星发射成功的惊人消息。
    日本电台在报道这个消息后还发表了东京大学教授、著名物理学家畑中武夫的谈话。畑中说，他为苏联宇宙飞船卫星的重量之大而吃惊。畑中并且认为，人类实现宇宙旅行的日子更近了。
    新华社15日讯　苏联发射了卫星式飞船后，中国航空科学家们欢欣鼓舞地欢迎苏联这一巨大的科学成就。北京航空学院当天下午就举行了座谈会。航空学院院长武光、副教授张锡圣、董寿莘、文传源、何庆芝、赵震炎等参加了这个座谈会。      
    张锡圣说，苏联这次发射巨型卫星式飞船，是为了征服大自然造福于人类，而美国却用U—2型飞机来从事战争的目的。这是社会主义和资本主义两种根本不同制度的鲜明对比。苏联这次发射卫星式飞船正是苏联发射第三个人造卫星的两周年。在仅仅两年的时期内，苏联火箭的推力猛增了三倍以上。这是这次发射首先使人感到鼓舞的事情。
    其次，这个巨型飞船是可以控制的，这为今后载人飞行返回地球创造了一个极重要的条件。可以肯定，苏联正在为飞船安全地在指定区域降落创造着极其重要的条件。
    第三，从1957年10月4日苏联第一个人造地球卫星发射成功以来，三个卫星，三个宇宙火箭，两个多级弹道火箭以至今天的卫星式飞船，每个都是按计划进行，一个比一个重，一个比一个精确，而美国却恰恰相反，不但重量大大不如苏联，而且多次失败，这两者正好说明美国科学落后于苏联的距离越来越大。我们相信，苏联这次发射的成功，为人类作宇宙航行创造了重要的开端。
    文传源说，这次苏联发射的卫星式飞船的轨道接近于圆形，这是在控制技术上的重要成就。卫星式飞船可以根据地面的指令下降，这是为人返回地球所必需的安全降落，打下了基础。
    此外，这次飞行，还必将为科学测量出更为丰富的数据。这些数据可以更正确地鉴定科学家们的研究结果。
    赵震炎认为，苏联这次发射卫星式飞船成功，是上次发射太平洋火箭成功的必然结果。这次在飞船上装上了一千四百七十七公斤重的仪器，超过过去历次卫星或宇宙火箭的仪器重量很多，而且还装了一个“假人”，这样就可以测得比较过去多得多的数据，说明人要进入宇宙飞行的时代已经不远了。卫星式飞船的轨道接近圆形，那就必需在速度的大小和方向的控制上都要相当准确才行。
    初步估计，卫星式飞船的起飞推力约在一千吨左右。这是苏联火箭技术的重大胜利。因为，这样大的推力，对制造火箭本身的结构、材料的要求是非常高的。
    卫星式飞船的可以控制，能按照地面指令下降，估计在飞船上还装有可控制的反推力发动机，而这一点正是人作宇宙飞行的重要技术条件之一。苏联这次发射卫星式飞船正和美国本月13日发射“气球卫星”失败形成尖锐的对比。美国发射这卫星的企图是为了转播艾森豪威尔演说，结果还是没有成功。而苏联是为了人类作宇宙飞行创造条件。这是两个完全不同的目的上的对比；而在火箭技术上的对比，谁优谁劣根本就无法相提并论的。
    董寿莘说，从1957年10月4日苏联发射第一个人造地球卫星以来，到现在仅有两年半的时间，苏联在火箭技术上的进展速度是惊人的。如果这次第一级火箭发动机是由四个发动机组成，那么，每个发动机的推力约二百五十吨左右。而美国火箭发动机最大的推力还只有七十五吨左右。苏联在火箭技术上已经达到了极完善的程度。
