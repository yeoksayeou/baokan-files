Xinhua News Agency, May 15th: According to Ankara sources, despite the Turkish government's implementation of martial law and other harsh suppression measures, large-scale demonstrations erupted again in Ankara and Istanbul on the 14th, opposing the U.S.-backed Menderes regime.

    The demonstration in Ankara on the 14th occurred close to dusk. The demonstration began with about two thousand five hundred students marching to a square in the commercial district, singing anti-government songs such as "Can brothers kill brothers?" and "Smoke covers the mountaintop." They also shouted slogans such as: "Menderes, resign!" "We want freedom!" "Down with the dictator!"

    As they marched, more and more people joined the ranks of the march, and finally, more than ten thousand people gathered on Ataturk Avenue.

    Demonstrators scattered leaflets from the air, which said: "The youth and people of our country have decided to obtain democracy for the people of the whole country." Some of them tried to get to Ankara Radio, but were blocked by the army.

    Many people living in the apartment buildings on Ataturk Avenue leaned out of the windows and cheered the demonstrators outside.

    The panicked authorities dispatched one thousand police and cavalry troops, who used tear gas and cavalry charges to disperse the dense crowds. It is reported that approximately one hundred and fifty people were arrested. Many people were injured or killed.

    That night, the panicked authorities drove out all the people in the cinemas, restaurants and cafes on Ataturk Avenue. The cavalry troops, fully armed, and with rifles, blocked all roads leading to Ataturk Avenue. Heavy troops were stationed outside the headquarters of Menderes' Democratic Party for protection.

    According to a Reuters report from Istanbul: On the 14th, "five thousand students demonstrated against the Turkish government." The report said that students standing in front of the Kemal monument disregarded martial law and held up signs saying "We Want Freedom."

Xinhua News Agency, May 15th: Izmir News: In the Turkish port city of Izmir, where U.S. military bases are located, anti-government demonstrations broke out today shortly after the dictatorial government's Prime Minister Menderes arrived. It is reported that more than four thousand demonstrators shouted slogans such as "Freedom, Freedom" and "Menderes resign!" on the streets.

    The demonstrators were suppressed by a large contingent of military police and beaten by the ruling Democratic Party thugs.

    Menderes left Istanbul by boat yesterday for Izmir, starting his "Aegean region trip to save the political situation." Shortly after he boarded the ship yesterday, a massive demonstration of tens of thousands of people broke out in Istanbul.

    After arriving in Izmir, Menderes delivered a speech, revealing his conspiracy to further suppress the patriotic people of Turkey. He clamored that the government "is determined to stop" the demonstrations. While making threats, he also announced that a "general election" would be held. The elections for the Turkish National Assembly were originally scheduled to be held next year, but the Democratic Party reactionary government, which has been subjected to increasing condemnation, is worried that the later the election is held, the more unfavorable it will be for it, and therefore had long planned to hold it earlier this year.

    坚持反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争  
    土耳其人民再次爆发大示威
    安卡拉、伊斯坦布尔和伊兹密尔成千上万示威群众高呼“曼德列斯辞职”等口号
    新华社15日讯　据安卡拉消息，尽管土耳其政府实行了戒严法并采取了其他严酷的镇压措施，14日在安卡拉和伊斯坦布尔又爆发了大示威，反对美国扶植的曼德列斯政权。
    安卡拉14日的示威是在将近傍晚的时候发生的，示威开始的时候约有两千五百名学生游行到商业区的广场，唱着“兄弟岂能枪杀兄弟？”和“烟雾弥漫着山顶”等反对政府的歌曲。他们还高呼：“曼德列斯，辞职！”“我们要自由！”“该死的独裁者！”等口号。
    当他们游行的时候，愈来愈多的人参加了游行的队伍，到最后，聚集在阿塔图克大街的人达到一万人以上。
    示威者从空中撒了传单，这些传单说：“我国的青年和人民已决定为全国人民取得民主”。其中有些人想设法到安卡拉电台去，但是受到军队的阻止。
    住在阿塔图克大街上的公寓房子里许多人从窗户里伸出身子向外边的示威者欢呼。
    惊慌失措的当局开来了一千名警察和骑兵部队，他们用催泪弹和骑兵部队的横冲直撞来驱散密密层层的群众。据报道，接着大约有一百五十人被捕。有许多人伤亡。
    这天晚上，惊慌失措的当局赶走了阿塔图克大街上的所有电影院、饭店和咖啡馆中的人。骑兵部队全副武装，拿着步枪，封锁了通往阿塔图克大街的所有的路。曼德列斯的民主党总部的外面，设置重兵保护。
    据路透社伊斯坦布尔的消息说：14日“有五千名学生示威反对土耳其政府。”消息说，站在凯末尔纪念像前面的学生不顾戒严法，拿着“我们要自由”的标语牌。
    新华社15日讯　伊兹密尔消息：在设有美国军事基地的土耳其港口城市伊兹密尔，今天当独裁政府总理曼德列斯到达后不久就爆发了反政府的示威。据报道，有四千余名示威者在街上高呼“自由、自由”，“曼德列斯辞职”等口号。
    示威者遭到了大队军警的镇压和执政的民主党党徒们的殴打。
    曼德列斯是昨天乘船离开伊斯坦布尔前往伊兹密尔，开始他的“挽回政局的爱琴海地区旅行”。昨天他上船后不久，伊斯坦布尔就爆发了万人大示威。
    曼德列斯在到达伊兹密尔后发表演说，透露了他对土耳其的爱国人民进一步镇压的阴谋。他叫嚣说，政府“已下决心要制止”示威。在进行威胁的同时，他又宣布要举行“大选”。土耳其国民议会的选举原应在明年举行，但是遭受到越来越多谴责的民主党反动政府担心选举越迟举行对它越不利，因而早就计划提前在今年举行。
