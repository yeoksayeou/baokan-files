    A Batch of Workers in Tangshan Become Technical Cadres
    Under the long-term cultivation and education of the Party, the technical level of the broad masses of workers in Tangshan City has greatly improved.
    Recently, enterprises have promoted a number of outstanding workers to engineering and technical personnel. As of the end of April, the city had promoted a total of 1,790 engineering and technical cadres.
    Among the workers promoted this time are Wang Yiyuan, a nationally renowned steelmaking hero, Xu Xiumin, a textile expert, Zhao Lianzhong, an old hero from the Shanhaiguan Bridge Factory, and Zhao Xining, a daring and capable pioneer from Kailuan Zhaogezhuang Mine who has innovated more than 300 tools in nine years.

    Chongqing Rapidly Eliminates Hookworm Disease
    Chongqing City, where hookworm disease was once severely prevalent, has eliminated hookworm disease in 2.2 million rural people in the past year or so, restoring the health and enhancing the labor capacity of more than 20,000 severe hookworm patients who had completely lost their ability to work. The infection rate of hookworm disease in the city has been reduced from the original 80% to below 30%, increasing the equivalent of more than 100,000 agricultural laborers, which has played a significant role in promoting the development of agricultural production.

    Forty-Three Veteran Workers Graduate from University
    The first group of forty-three worker-students from Shanxi Jinxi Machine Factory graduated from the part-work, part-study university. These workers received higher education in their own factory through two and a half years of part-work, part-study.
    Now, this group of veteran worker-students has become a "key problem assault team" in the factory's technical innovation and technical revolution movement. The eight design projects they have chosen are all major technical bottlenecks in the factory. The "design barriers" of these eight projects have been completely overcome by them, and one of them has been successfully trial-produced and put into production.

    Harbin Children Exercise from an Early Age
    Harbin City has launched children's health and physical exercises such as air baths, sun baths, cold water baths, rubbing exercises, and gymnastics. As of the end of March this year, 523 nurseries and kindergartens in the city have carried out this work, with more than 30,000 children participating in the exercises. Children who have undergone exercise have shown good results in terms of growth and development, and enhanced physical fitness. For example, children in the Harbin Municipal People's Committee Kindergarten have been exercising for three years. 97.5% of the children in the kindergarten have sound development, and the incidence of disease has also been greatly reduced.

    Shandong's Cultural and Educational Front Supports Agricultural Production
    Various departments on Shandong Province's cultural and educational front are doing everything possible to support agricultural production. At present, all colleges and universities and secondary vocational schools have linked up with nearby counties and suburban people's communes, fixing support targets and taking full responsibility.
    Scientific and technical personnel are also actively serving agricultural production. They have applied radioactive isotopes (tracer atoms) to research on preventing wheat lodging, cotton boll shedding, rational close planting seeding rates, and the life history of armyworms, and have achieved certain results. Cultural and artistic departments often organize various cultural and artistic service groups to perform while working on water conservancy construction sites and drought resistance front lines, and film projection teams also show films in the fields.

    Farmer Expert Li Runchu Writes Scientific Papers
    Li Runchu, a farmer-born entomologist from Sinan County, Guizhou Province, has diligently studied entomology, mastered the life history of more than 100 kinds of insects, and formulated many highly effective native pesticides to prevent and control various insect pests. Not long ago, Li Runchu attended a scientific discussion meeting held by the Institute of Entomology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences as an entomology expert, and his paper was also read at the meeting.

    New Methods to Improve Urban Environmental Sanitation
    In the midst of vigorously promoting environmental sanitation, Chenzhou City, Hunan Province, has implemented harmless garbage disposal. The city has established 463 garbage incineration kilns, which incinerate garbage every day, not only eliminating breeding grounds for germs and mosquitoes and flies, but also accumulating a large amount of high-quality fertilizer. From January to the end of April this year, of the more than 290,000 dan of fertilizer that the city supported the countryside with, more than 120,000 dan were refined fertilizer from incinerated garbage.

    Capacitor Oil Successfully Trial-Produced
    The Xi'an Institute of Chemistry of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Department of Chemistry of Northwest University, and the Xi'an Power Capacitor Factory have jointly collaborated to successfully trial-produce capacitor oil using indigenous methods. After testing, it fully meets the requirements.
    Using this capacitor oil can increase the capacity of capacitors by more than half; the volume of capacitors can be greatly reduced, saving a large amount of steel and high-grade insulating paper; the chemical performance is stable, neither explosive nor easily oxidized, and can also extend the life of capacitors. Capacitors that could originally be used for five to six years can now be used for about twenty years.

    要闻快报
    唐山一批工人当了技术干部
    唐山市广大工人，在党的长期培养教育下，技术水平有很大提高。
    最近，各企业提拔了一批优秀的工人为工程技术人员。截至4月底，全市共提拔了一千七百九十名工程技术干部。
    这次提拔的工人中，有全国闻名的炼钢英雄王益元，纺织能手徐秀敏，有山海关桥梁厂老英雄赵连仲，还有敢想敢干九年革新三百多项工具的闯将——开滦赵各庄矿工人赵西宁。
    重庆高速消灭钩虫病
    原来钩虫病严重流行的重庆市，一年多来已在二百二十万农村人口中消灭了钩虫病，使两万多个原来完全丧失劳动能力的重钩虫病患者恢复了健康，增强了劳动能力。全市钩虫病的感染率由原来的80％降低到30％以下，增加了相当于十多万个农业劳动力，对促进农业生产的发展起了很大的作用。
    四十三名老工人大学毕业
    山西晋西机器厂第一批四十三名工人大学生在半工半读大学结业。这批工人在自己的工厂里，经过二年半工半读，受完高等教育。
    现在这一批老工人大学生，已成为全厂技术革新和技术革命运动中的“攻关突击队”。他们选择的八个设计项目都是厂里较大的技术关键。这八个项目的“设计关”已被他们全部攻破，其中有一项已经试制成功并投入生产。
    哈尔滨儿童从小锻炼身体
    哈尔滨市开展了空气浴、日光浴、冷水浴及摩擦、体操等项小儿卫生体育锻炼。截至今年3月末，全市已有五百二十三处托儿所、幼儿园开展了这一工作，参加锻炼的儿童有三万多人。经过锻炼的儿童，在生长发育、增强体质等方面，都收到良好效果。如哈尔滨市人委幼儿园儿童，锻炼了三年。全园97.5％的儿童发育健全，发病率也大为降低。
    山东文教战线支援农业生产
    山东省文教战线各部门千方百计地支援农业生产。目前，各高等院校和中等专业学校都已纷纷同附近县、郊区的人民公社挂上钩，固定支援对象，一包到底。
    科学技术部门人员也积极为农业生产服务，他们把放射性同位素（示踪原子）应用于研究预防小麦倒伏、棉花脱铃、合理密植用种量以及粘虫的生活史等方面，都获得一定成绩。文化艺术部门经常组织各种文艺服务团，在水利工地、抗旱前线边劳动边演出，电影放影队也到田间放映影片。
    农民专家黎润初作科学论文
    贵州省思南县农民出身的昆虫学家黎润初，刻苦钻研昆虫学，掌握了一百多种昆虫的生活史，配制成许多杀虫效率高的土农药，防治了多种虫害。不久前，黎润初以昆虫学专家的身份，出席了中国科学院昆虫研究所举办的科学讨论会，会上还宣读了他的论文。
    改善城市环境卫生的新办法
    湖南省郴州市在大搞环境卫生中，实行垃圾无害化处理，全市建立了四百六十三个垃圾焚化窑，每天焚化垃圾，不但消灭了病菌和蚊蝇孳生场所，而且积攒了大批优质肥料。从今年元月到4月底，市内支援农村的二十九万多担肥料中，就有十二万多担焚化垃圾精肥。
    电容器油试制成功
    中国科学院西安化学研究所、西北大学化学系和西安电力电容器厂共同协作，用土法试制成功了电容器油。经过鉴定，完全合乎要求。
    采用这种电容器油，电容器的容量可以提高一半以上；电容器的体积大大缩小，节省了大量钢材和高级绝缘纸；化学性能稳定，既不爆炸，又不易氧化，还可以延长电容器寿命，原来能使用五至六年的电容器，现在即可使用二十年左右。
