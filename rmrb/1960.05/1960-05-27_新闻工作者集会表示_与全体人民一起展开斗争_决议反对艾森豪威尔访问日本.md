    News Workers' Gathering Expresses:
    Fighting Together with All the People
    Resolution Opposes Eisenhower's Visit to Japan
    More than a thousand Japanese news workers and news agency employees held a general mobilization rally in Tokyo on the morning of the 26th. They unanimously passed a resolution demanding the immediate resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and the dissolution of the Diet.
    The resolution also firmly opposed US President Eisenhower's visit to Japan, and opposed the so-called "industrial rationalization" implemented by capitalists and the suppression of the Miike coal mine workers.
    The resolution stated that news workers will stand with all the people to launch a struggle.
    Ishikawa Shigeru, director of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan's Dispute Countermeasures Department, addressed the meeting, calling on news workers to launch a struggle to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke government.
    The conference decided to demand that the publishers of various newspapers protest Kishi Nobusuke's attitude of ignoring and slandering the media, and to demand that they maintain peace and democracy through fair and truthful reporting.
    After the conference, all participants went to the
                  streets to hold a demonstration.
