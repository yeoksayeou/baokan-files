(Dispatch from Changchun, May 11th) Jilin Province is carrying out a massive mass movement for the comprehensive utilization of resources. Since the launch of this movement in February, it has now expanded to industries such as chemical, light industry, forestry, petroleum, metallurgy, machinery, electricity, building materials, and transportation, becoming an important aspect of the nationwide technical innovation and technical revolution movement. The scope of comprehensive utilization ranges from major raw materials such as coal, wood, acids, and alkalis, and agricultural and sideline products, to waste gas, waste liquid, waste residue, and waste materials. This not only improves the utilization rate of raw materials and expands the application range of raw materials, but also opens up new sources of raw materials in terms of quantity and variety, powerfully supporting the "production doubling" movement that is vigorously unfolding throughout the province.

The comprehensive utilization of resources by enterprises in Jilin Province mainly involves three aspects: first, the comprehensive utilization of raw materials; second, the comprehensive utilization of "waste"; and third, the comprehensive utilization of equipment. These three aspects are interconnected and conditional on each other. Currently, the main focus of most enterprises is to drive the latter with the former two, with comprehensive utilization of raw materials being the key focus within the main focus. At present, the chemical, forestry, and light industries have achieved relatively significant results. By adopting new technologies, new formulas, improving processes, and improving equipment, they have achieved a "great renovation" of raw materials and a "great turnaround" of waste, achieving "turning small uses into big uses, turning single uses into multiple uses, and turning useless into useful."

In the chemical industry, the comprehensive utilization of waste gas, waste water, waste residue, and waste materials is particularly prominent. Jilin Chemical Industrial Company aims to achieve "three zeros" (no waste gas, no waste water, no waste residue). Currently, it has used waste to produce 27 kinds of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, dyes, as well as raw materials for papermaking and chemical industry, and also 10 kinds of cutting-edge and high-grade products. In the light industry, the comprehensive utilization of agricultural and sideline products is most prominent. They utilize four categories of materials: bran, skin, shells, and stalks from grain processing; heads, hooves, bones, hair, and internal organs of pigs, horses, cattle, and sheep; various wild plants; and waste liquid and waste materials. Currently, they have successfully tested and produced 130 kinds of products.

The movement for the comprehensive utilization of resources in Jilin Province is being carried out in conjunction with enterprises developing diversified operations. This not only enables the raw materials industrial departments to increase new products, but also enables the processing industrial departments to produce new raw materials, materials, and fuels. At present, a large number of chemical raw materials and chemical products used in the province come from specialized chemical plants, as well as grain processing plants, livestock product processing plants, oil and wine factories, sugar refineries, paper mills, and leather factories. The province's industrial production is developing in the direction of one person mastering multiple skills, one factory performing multiple functions, and one factory leading several factories, becoming more economical and more rational.

Currently, the following types of enterprise management suitable for large-scale comprehensive utilization have emerged in Jilin Province:

The first type is based on one major industry, with large factories leading small factories to form comprehensive joint enterprises. In order to recover and comprehensively utilize waste water and waste residue, Jilin Paper Mill will expand a chemical branch factory. In this way, the entire factory will form a joint enterprise centered on papermaking, while simultaneously producing alkali, lignin, turpentine, bakelite powder, and other chemical products.

The second type is to comprehensively utilize existing equipment to achieve multiple functions in one factory. Jilin Sugar Refinery and Xinzheng Sugar Refinery have successfully tested the use of sugar-making equipment to produce glucose, alcohol, soda ash, and other products, breaking the conventional pattern of the sugar industry of "half a year of production and half a year of idleness."

The third type is for large factories to branch out and grow leaves, and to vigorously establish affiliated factories. Longtan District of Jilin City and the three major chemical factories of Jilin Chemical Industrial Company (fertilizer, dye, and calcium carbide factories) are "aligned," and three small chemical factories have been established as auxiliary factories to the three major chemical factories, specializing in utilizing the waste water and waste residue of these three large factories for production.

The fourth type is to establish comprehensive factories based on the comprehensive utilization of resources in resource bases. For example, waste material processing plants and forest chemical plants have been established in the Changbai Mountains.

The fifth type is to set up waste product processing plants in cities, specializing in the comprehensive utilization of waste. Liaoyuan City established a waste product comprehensive processing plant in 1958 on the basis of a waste product collection team, specializing in processing waste. Currently, it has used waste to produce 125 kinds of products.

At present, the mass movement for the comprehensive utilization of resources in Jilin Province is being further deepened and broadened. A comprehensive utilization network based on industrial enterprises, with the chemical industry as the backbone, combining large, medium, and small enterprises, integrating urban and rural areas, and integrating factories and scientific research departments is gradually taking shape.

(Dispatch from Fuzhou by Xinhua News Agency) People's communes in the forest areas of Fujian Province are vigorously developing forest chemical production and comprehensive utilization of wood, and are launching a mass movement to establish 10,000 factories "starting with indigenous methods and focusing on small scale." So far, more than 8,000 various forest chemical plants have been established throughout the province. These chemical plants use discarded branches, twigs, root bark, wood chips, and other waste materials from the mountains to produce more than 3.1 million kilograms of more than 20 kinds of chemical products, such as fiberboard and tannin extract, in the past three months or so, increasing the wealth of the country by several million yuan.

People's communes in various localities have successively rebuilt and expanded more than 200 "small foreign groups" forest chemical plants on the basis of the original "small indigenous groups." Workers in the tannin extract workshop of the Liancheng County Comprehensive Chemical Plant carried out technical innovations, manufacturing a set of semi-indigenous and semi-foreign equipment, which increased the daily output of tannin extract from 8 kilograms to 600 kilograms, and increased the tannin content from 36% to 49%, catching up with the level of foreign production methods. Xudun Commune in Jian'ou County used local materials to make its own cutting machines, pulping machines, and other equipment, realizing the mechanization of fiberboard raw material processing, and increasing work efficiency by five to twenty times.

With the development of the movement to vigorously establish forest chemical plants and comprehensively utilize wood in various localities, the vast forest areas have gradually transformed from a single forestry production base into a comprehensive production base with forestry and industry going hand in hand, which has not only prospered the mountain economy, but also increased the production of a large number of industrial raw materials and chemical products for the country's socialist construction. According to preliminary plans by relevant departments, this year, forest areas in various localities will use waste materials such as branches, twigs, root bark, treetop, and sawdust to produce about 100,000 tons of forest chemical products such as fiberboard, tannin extract, and activated carbon, with an output value of 120 million yuan.

(Dispatch from Nanning by Xinhua News Agency) The people of all ethnic groups in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region are fully utilizing forest resources and vigorously developing the forest chemical industry, making the comprehensive utilization of forest by-products blossom everywhere.

Guangxi is located in the subtropics and has abundant forest resources. This year, in order to adapt to the new situation of national economic development, while mobilizing the masses to go to the mountains to collect wild plants and doing a good job in forest production, the autonomous region has decided to vigorously develop the forest chemical industry focusing on the manufacture of fiberboard, requiring counties, communes, and yards (timber storage yards, logging yards, forest farms) to build factories, and factories to have workshops. So far, the number of forest chemical plants built by the forestry system alone, combining indigenous and foreign methods, has reached 356, which is 2.7 times that of last year. These factories have already produced more than 2,000 tons of fiberboard, tannin extract, rosin, rosin, etc., providing a large amount of raw materials for the building materials industry and the light chemical industry. In Baise Prefecture, where ethnic minorities live in concentrated communities, forest chemical plants have been built in deep mountains and dense forests. Some commune members of the Zhuang, Miao, and Yao ethnic groups who have never seen machines have become forest chemical workers mastering new technologies.

    原材料“大翻新”　废物“大翻身”　一机多用　一厂多能
    吉林省综合利用资源形成热潮
    福建、广西发动群众大办林产化学工业
    本报长春11日电　吉林省正在开展一个声势浩大的综合利用资源的群众运动。这一运动从2月份开展以来，目前已扩展到化工、轻工、森工、石油、冶金、机械、电力、建筑材料以及交通运输等行业，成为全民性技术革新和技术革命运动的一个重要方面。综合利用的范围，由煤炭、木材、酸、碱等主要原料材料以及农副产品，直到废气、废液、废渣和废料；不仅提高了原材料的利用程度，扩大了原材料的应用范围，而且从数量上、品种上开辟了原材料的新来源，有力地支援了正在全省蓬勃开展的“生产翻番”运动。
    吉林省各企业综合利用资源的工作，主要有三个方面：一、综合利用原料材料；二、综合利用“废物”；三、综合利用设备。三者相互结合，互为条件。当前绝大多数企业的主攻方向是以前两个带动后一个；而综合利用原材料又是主攻中的重点。目前，成果比较显著的有化工、森林工业、轻工三个行业。它们通过采用新技术、新配方、改进工艺、改进设备等途径，使原料材料“大翻新”，废物“大翻身”，作到了“变小用为大用，变一用为多用，变无用为有用”。
    在化学工业方面，综合利用废气、废水、废渣、废料最为突出。吉林化学工业公司以实现“三无”（无废气、无废水、无废渣）为纲，目前已用废物制成化肥、农药、染料，以及造纸、化工原料二十七种，还有尖端产品和高级产品十种。轻工业方面，综合利用农副产品最为突出。他们利用粮米加工后的糠、皮、壳、秸、猪、马、牛、羊的头、蹄、骨、毛、内脏，各种野生植物以及废液、废物等四类物资，目前已试验成功和生产出一百三十种产品。
    吉林省综合利用资源的运动，是同企业开展多种经营结合进行的。这样不仅使原材料工业部门增加了新的产品，而且使加工工业部门也能生产出新的原料、材料和燃料。目前，全省所用的大批化工原料和化工产品，有来自专业化工厂的，也有从粮米加工厂、畜产品加工厂、油酒厂、制糖厂、造纸厂、皮革厂生产出来的。全省工业生产正向着一人多艺、一厂多能、一厂带数厂，更经济、更合理的方向发展。
    目前，吉林省已经出现了下列几种适应大搞综合利用的企业管理类型：
    第一种，以一个行业为主，大厂带小厂，组成综合性联合企业。吉林省造纸厂为了回收和综合利用废水、废渣，将扩建一个化工分厂。这样，全厂将形成以造纸为中心，同时生产碱、木质素、松节油、电木粉等多种化工产品的联合企业。
    第二种，综合利用现有设备，实现一厂多能。吉林省制糖厂和新中国制糖厂，试验成功用制糖设备生产葡萄糖、酒精、纯碱等产品，打破了制糖工业“半年生产半年闲”的常规。
    第三种，大厂分枝、生叶，大办附属工厂。吉林市龙潭区与吉林化学工业公司所属的肥料、染料、电石三大化工厂“对口”，办了三个小化工厂，作为三大化工厂的辅助厂，专门利用这三个大厂的废水、废渣进行生产。
    第四种，在资源基地，建立以综合利用为主的综合性工厂。例如，长白山区就建立了废材加工厂和林产化工厂。
    第五种，在城市里办废品加工厂，专搞废物综合利用。辽源市从1958年就在一个废品收购小组的基础上，办起一家废品综合加工厂，专门加工废品，目前已用废物生产了一百二十五种产品。
    目前，吉林省综合利用资源的群众运动正在进一步深入广泛地开展。一个以工业企业为主、化学工业为骨干、大中小相结合、城市和农村相结合、工厂和科学研究部门相结合的综合利用网正在逐步形成。
    据新华社福州电　福建省林区各人民公社大搞林产化工生产和木材综合利用，正在开展一个以“土法上马，小型为主”建立一万个工厂的群众运动。到目前为止，全省已经兴办起各种林产化工厂八千多座。这些化工厂利用原来抛弃山场的枝桠、根皮、木屑等废材，在最近三个多月中生产了纤维板、栲胶等二十多种化工产品共三百一十多万公斤，为国家增产了数百万元的财富。
    各地人民公社已在原有“小土群”的基础上先后改建和扩建了二百多个“小洋群”林产化工厂。连城县综合化工厂栲胶车间工人大闹技术革新，制造了一套半土半洋设备，使栲胶日产量由八公斤猛增到六百公斤，单宁含量由36％增加到49％，赶上了洋法生产水平。建瓯县徐墩公社利用土材料自制切料机、磨浆机等设备，实现了纤维板原料加工机械化，提高工效五倍到二十倍。
    随着各地大办林产化工厂、大搞木材综合利用运动的发展，已使广大林区由单一的林业生产，逐步变成为林业和工业同时并举的综合性生产基地，既繁荣了山区经济，又为国家社会主义建设增产了大量工业原料和化工产品。据有关部门初步规划，今年各地林区就将利用枝桠、根皮、梢头、锯末等废材，生产纤维板、栲胶、活性炭等林产化工产品十万吨左右，产值将达一亿二千万元。
    据新华社南宁电　广西僮族自治区各族人民，充分利用森林资源，大办林产化学工业，使林副产品的综合利用遍地开花。
    广西位于亚热带，森林资源丰富。今年，为了适应国民经济发展的新形势，在发动群众上山采集野生植物和搞好林木生产的同时，自治区决定因地制宜大力发展以制造纤维板为主的林产化学工业，要求县县、社社、场场（贮木场、采伐场、林场）建厂，厂厂有车间。到目前为止，仅林业系统建立的土洋结合的林产化学工厂即达三百五十六座，为去年的二点七倍。这些工厂已经生产出纤维板、栲胶、松脂、松香等二千多吨，为建筑材料工业、轻化工业提供了大量原材料。少数民族聚居的百色专区，在深山密林中建起了林化工厂，有些从未见过机器的僮、苗、瑶等各族社员，已经成了掌握新技术的林化工人。
