(Comprehensive report from this newspaper) Xinhua News Agency reported: According to a broadcast by Guinean radio on the 11th, three imperialist warships were active for five days in mid-April near the sea bordering Guinea's northwest. The radio said that this was a threat to Guinea and that this action was related to the imperialists' subversive activities against Guinea.

The Guinean government has recently uncovered a series of conspiracies instigated by imperialists aimed at subverting the Republic of Guinea.

Guinean President Sékou Touré announced at a Guinean Democratic Party meeting on the evening of the 9th that the Guinean government had uncovered another plot to subvert the Guinean government and had seized the subversive organization's weapons and ammunition.

At the same time, Touré announced the verdicts for those who participated in the first subversive conspiracy case instigated by imperialists. He announced this conspiracy on April 21.

When the Guinean government uncovered the previous conspiracy case, it seized weapons and ammunition supplied to the conspirators by imperialist countries such as the United States, France, and West Germany. An arms exhibition was held in Conakry, the capital of Guinea, clearly showing that the United States, France, and West Germany were the main countries supplying weapons and ammunition to the conspirators who attempted to subvert Guinea.

Among the weapons on display were twenty-one boxes of American-made hand grenades and incendiary bombs labeled "U.S. Ordnance. Net Weight One-Half Pound," ten boxes of French-made bullets, twenty boxes of West German-made Mauser rifles, and so on. The exhibition aroused great anger among the Guinean people against the imperialists. Navy Lieutenant Quayat Sangbang said during a visit, "The hypocritical face of the imperialists and their divisive conspiracies have now been exposed to the broad masses of our country."

    坚决打击帝国主义的破坏阴谋
    几内亚又破获一颠复案
    科纳克里展出美、法、西德供给颠复分子的武器
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：据几内亚电台11日广播，4月中旬有三艘帝国主义者的军舰在靠近几内亚西北部边界的海面上活动了五天。电台说，这是对几内亚的一种威胁。这个行动同帝国主义的针对几内亚所进行的颠复活动有关。
    几内亚政府最近连续破获由帝国主义者策动的目的在于颠复几内亚共和国的阴谋案。
    几内亚共和国总统塞古·杜尔9日晚上在一次几内亚民主党会议上宣布，几内亚政府已经破获了另一个企图颠复几内亚政府的阴谋，并且搜出了这个颠复组织的武器和弹药。
    同时，杜尔宣布了对参加第一起由帝国主义者策动的颠复阴谋案的人的判决。这个阴谋案是他在4月21日宣布的。
    几内亚政府在破获上一次阴谋案时，搜出了美国、法国和西德等帝国主义国家供给阴谋分子的武器和弹药。并在几内亚首都科纳克里举办了一个武器展览会，展览会清楚地表明，美国、法国、西德是供给那些企图颠复几内亚的阴谋分子以武器和弹药的主要国家。
    在展出的这些武器中，有二十一箱美国制造的手榴弹和上面写着“美国军械处。净重二分之一磅”的燃烧弹、十箱法国造的枪弹、二十箱西德造的毛瑟枪等等。展览会激起了几内亚人民对帝国主义者的极大愤怒。一位名叫夸亚特·桑格榜的海军上尉在参观时说，“帝国主义者的伪善面目及其挑拨离间的阴谋勾当现在已经为我国广大群众所识破”。
