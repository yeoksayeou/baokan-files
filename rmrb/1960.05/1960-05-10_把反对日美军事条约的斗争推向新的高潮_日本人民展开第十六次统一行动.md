    Bringing the Struggle Against the U.S.-Japan Military Treaty to a New Climax
    Japanese People Launch 16th Unified Action
    General Council of Trade Unions decides to mobilize 20 million people to petition the Diet, general strike to be held within days
    Kishi Nobusuke Group intensifies activities in an attempt to realize the conspiracy of forcibly approving the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" by the Diet
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 9th: The Japanese people are launching their 16th nationwide unified action starting today, resolutely opposing the Diet's approval of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and demanding the dissolution of the Diet and the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet.
    According to the action program adopted by the Japanese "National Council to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty," this unified action, which is larger in scale than in the past, will continue until May 26 – the date on which the Japanese Diet session should close. From May 9 to 15, 5,000 people will continuously petition the Diet every day, and May 14 is designated as "Concentrated Petition Day," with a large-scale petition of 100,000 people to the Diet. Then a national rally will be held against the ratification of the new "Security Treaty" and demanding the dissolution of the Diet.
    On May 13, the "National Council" will send representatives to protest to the U.S. Embassy in Japan, opposing the United States' conclusion of this aggressive military alliance treaty with Japan.
    The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan has decided to mobilize 20 million people to petition the Diet in this unified action. On May 12, trade unions will hold simultaneous strikes and workplace rallies across the country. The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, with 3.6 million members, has also decided that if the Kishi Nobusuke Group forcibly suspends the debate on the new "Security Treaty" in the Diet or extends the Diet session, it will hold a general strike nationwide.
    At the same time, the "National Council to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty," composed of more than 140 national organizations, will collect signatures nationwide against the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," with the goal of reaching 10 million signatories.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 9th: Regardless of the resolute opposition of the Japanese people and the people of all countries, Japanese Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke today specially convened a meeting of Diet members of the ruling party to instigate the acceleration of the Diet's approval of the aggressive U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. He convened this meeting under the guise of unifying the opinions of Liberal Democratic Party members regarding the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."
    Although the Diet has not yet discussed many issues related to the new "Security Treaty," as well as many subsidiary agreements and documents of the treaty, Kishi Nobusuke today fabricated at the ruling party's Diet members' meeting that: "The new treaty has been carefully deliberated." He clamored that "for the sake of Japan's interests," the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" should be passed in this Diet session.
    In this speech, Kishi Nobusuke once again exposed his attempt to forcibly deprive the opposition parties of the right to conduct more questioning on the new "Security Treaty," and conspired to force a vote at a time he deemed favorable. His excuse was: "No matter how long the discussion lasts, the basic ideas are different."
    Kishi Nobusuke asked the Liberal Democratic Party members to "unite as one" and follow him in "finding a way" to have the new "Security Treaty" passed in this Diet session.
    According to Kyodo News, only 150 of the more than 420 Liberal Democratic Party Diet members attended today's meeting. It is worth noting that the leaders of some factions within the ruling party, such as Kenzo Matsumura, Tanzan Ishibashi, Takeo Miki, Ichiro Kono, and Hayato Ikeda, did not attend the meeting.
    In order to realize the sinister conspiracy of forcibly approving the new "Security Treaty" in this Diet session, the Kishi Nobusuke Group has decided to not hesitate to have the ruling party "deliberate alone" and rely on its majority seats to "vote alone." However, some factions within the ruling party have expressed opposition to Kishi Nobusuke's approach. Kishi Nobusuke and his confidants have recently held frequent meetings with the leaders of various factions, asking them to "cooperate" with Kishi Nobusuke in order to gather enough votes to pass the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" in the Diet.

    把反对日美军事条约的斗争推向新的高潮
    日本人民展开第十六次统一行动
    总评决定动员两千万人向国会请愿，日内举行总罢工
    岸信介集团加紧活动企图实现强使国会批准日美“安全条约”的阴谋
    新华社9日讯　东京消息：日本人民从今天起展开第十六次全国性统一行动，坚决反对国会批准新日美“安全条约”，要求解散国会和岸信介内阁下台。
    根据日本“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”通过的行动纲领，这次规模比过去更加浩大的统一行动将持续到5月26日——日本国会会议应该闭幕的日子。从5月9日到15日，每天将有五千人川流不息地向国会进行请愿并规定5月14日为“集中请愿日”，向国会进行十万人的大规模请愿。然后举行反对批准新“安全条约”和要求解散国会的国民大会。
    5月13日，“国民会议”将派代表向美国驻日大使馆提出抗议，反对美国同日本缔结这项侵略性的军事同盟条约。
    日本工会总评议会决定在这次统一行动中动员两千万人向国会请愿。5月12日，各工会要在全国同时举行罢工和工作场所大会。拥有三百六十万会员的日本工会总评议会还决定，如果岸信介集团在国会强行停止关于新“安全条约”的辩论或者延长国会会期，它将在全国举行总罢工。
    同时，由一百四十多个全国性团体组成的“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”将在全国各地征集反对新日美“安全条约”的签名，目标是使签名者达到一千万人。
    新华社9日讯　东京消息：不顾日本人民和各国人民的坚决反对，日本首相岸信介今天特别召集执政党国会议员举行会议，策动加速使国会批准侵略性的日美军事同盟条约。他是以统一自由民主党议员对新日美“安全条约”的意见的名义召开这次会议的。
    尽管国会对新“安全条约”的很多问题以及条约的许多附属协定、文件还都没有讨论，岸信介今天却在执政党议员会议上捏造说：“对新条约已经慎重地进行了审议”。他叫嚷“为了日本的利益”，要在这次国会会议中通过新日美“安全条约”。
    岸信介在这次谈话中再次暴露了他企图强行剥夺在野党对新“安全条约”进行更多质询的权利，并阴谋在他认为有利的时机强行表决。他的借口是：“无论进行多么长时间的讨论，基本思想也是不同的”。
    岸信介要求自由民主党的议员们“团结一致”，跟随着他在这次国会中“设法”使新“安全条约”获得通过。
    据共同社报道，四百二十多名自由民主党国会议员中出席今天会议的只有一百五十名议员。值得注意的是，执政党内一些派系的首脑，如松村谦三、石桥湛山、三木武夫、河野一郎、池田勇人等都没有出席这次会议。
    为了实现在这次国会会议上强行批准新“安全条约”的罪恶阴谋，岸信介集团已经决定不惜要由执政党“单独审议”，并依仗多数议席“单独表决”。但是，执政党内一些派系表示反对岸信介的这种做法。岸信介和他的亲信最近几天频繁地同各派首脑会谈，要求他们同岸信介“合作”，以便凑足过半数的票数，使新日美“安全条约”获得国会的批准。（附图片）
