Change
Ji Xuepei

As soon as you arrive in Zaoyang County, Hubei Province, you can see this big character "Change" everywhere – in the streets and alleys, in the fields, on trees and walls, and even in shop windows. ...

The writing styles are of course also diverse. Some simply write a "Change" character the size of a bamboo basket; others add a line or a few lines of smaller characters below the "Change" character, such as: "Comrade, how have you changed?" or: "Do you want to change? Can you change? How to change?..." and so on.

Frankly, at first, I didn't pay much attention to this "Change" character. But once I ran around the countryside for a day, it immediately came alive in my heart.

Later, as I visited several communes, saw several places, and met some people, gradually, I discovered that it not only came alive in my heart, but also grew bigger and bigger, became taller and taller, emitting dazzling light, like a raging fire, making my heart surge and unable to control myself.

At this point, I began to think and try to figure out some reasons.

In Hubei Province, Zaoyang County is a famous county known for its soaring enthusiasm. In recent years, under the wise leadership of the Party, they have set high aspirations, made great ambitions, worked hard and cleverly, leaped again and again, and threw off the "low-yield hat" in one fell swoop, becoming a red flag of "transforming hilly land to catch up with plains." This is not without reason. It is said that Zaoyang County used to be a place that even the "imperial court" didn't want, with rolling hills and thin soil over thick rock. If it didn't rain for five days, the yellow clay would crack open, let alone any harvest. But in a short time, it has transformed into this scene: canals crisscrossing, ponds everywhere, and you are sure to find a large reservoir with vast waves and clear water nestled among the mountains and valleys within three to five li.

It is just April. If you look at the surrounding crops, you will be amazed. I am a northerner, but frankly speaking, I have never seen such good wheat. When I say it is good, I am not referring to ten or eight acres, or hundreds or thousands of acres, but tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of acres; when I say it is good, I am not referring to most of them being good, with a small part not so good, but every plot is good, every plant is good. But when you look out over the endless sea of green wheat, do not forget that you are standing on a hill, and that wheat forest as tall as the wall is also growing on a yellow soil ridge.

In another place, you will see such a scene: the mirror-like paddy fields, layered on top of each other, reaching the top of the mountain. The tender yellow seedling fields, interspersed among them, emit a soft golden yellow. The canals hang straight down from the mountains, glittering with silver light, like the ribbons of the immortals. A gust of wind blows on your face, cool and refreshing, with a rich fishy smell of water. At this moment, will you still remember that you are standing on the plateau of northwestern Hubei?

Of course, it is difficult to outline the entire picture of Zaoyang County today in this short space. For example, the factories with rows of chimneys, the Yangdang New Village known as "Little Shanghai," and the countless "residential points" of green brick and tile houses scattered in the fields, etc. I cannot describe them one by one.

But what do the phenomena mentioned above illustrate? If we want to summarize it in one word, it is a "overwhelming" big "Change" character.

Chairman Mao said well: "Poverty gives rise to the desire for change." "Change" means making revolution. The people of Zaoyang County are now making revolution against the sky, against the earth, and against nature.

This revolution is underway and is becoming more and more in-depth and intense. From the masses, cadres, and Party leaders I have come into contact with, I deeply feel this demand, this power, this enthusiasm, and that ambition, like the surging Yellow River and Yangtze River, rolling forward with unparalleled momentum.

Comrades in Zaoyang told me that, based on the current water storage capacity of reservoirs and ponds in the county, it is more than enough to irrigate all the land in the county, but there are still some mountain tops and ridges that cannot be watered. Therefore, their current outstanding task is to find every possible way to move the water to the top of the mountains.

To achieve this goal, you see, teams of water conservancy troops are rushing to the "front line"; the muffled thunder-like blasting sounds are heard one after another. They are determined to paint that "overwhelming" big "Change" character even bigger and more beautiful.

If you ask me what I have learned from this, I can only say that the reason why the people of Zaoyang County have such great enthusiasm and are doing such an excellent job today is because they deeply understand the meaning of this "Change" character. They understand: if you want to completely change your destiny, there is only one "Change." Not only must you "Change," but you must also be able to "Change," and you must constantly "Change"!

    变
    吉学霈
    一到湖北枣阳县，到处都能碰到这么个大“变”字——街头巷尾、地头田边、树上墙上，还有商店的橱窗里面。……
    写法当然也是多种多样的。有的是，单单写上一个竹篮大的“变”字；有的则在“变”字下面附上一行或几行小字，如：“同志，你变的怎样了？”或：“要不要变？能不能变？怎样变法？……”诸如此类。
    老实说，起初，我对这么个“变”字并没介意。但是一当我到乡下跑了一天以后，马上它就在我的心里活起来了。
    以后，随着我又访问了几个公社、看了几个地方、接触了一些人，逐渐地，我发现它不仅在我的心里活了，而且越来越大，越变越高，发出耀眼的光彩，像团熊熊的烈火，使我心情激荡、不能自己。
    至此，我才开始想，并且企图悟出一点道理来。
    在湖北省，枣阳县是个有名的干劲冲天的县份，几年来，他们在党的英明领导下，树雄心、立大志，实干加巧干，一跃再跃，一举扔掉了“低产帽子”，成为“岗地赶平原”的一面红旗，这不是没有原因的。据说，枣阳县过去是个连“朝廷老子”都不愿意要的地方，丘岗绵亘，石厚土薄，五天不下雨，黄胶土就炸得滚个开花，哪里还谈得到什么收成？但是曾几何时，就变成此番景象：渠道纵横，堰塘遍地，走不上三里五里，你准能在山谷丛岭之间，发现一座波涛万顷、碧波荡漾的大型水库。
    正是4月天。你要看下周围的庄稼，准叫你啧舌吃惊。我是北方人，但是老实说，我还从没有见到过这样好的麦子。说它好，不是指的十亩八亩、百亩千亩，而是万亩或几十万亩；说它好，也不是指的大多数都好，还有一少部分不好，而是指的块块都好，棵棵都好。但是当你举目展望那绿浪滚滚无边无垠的麦海时，切不要忘记你是站在岗上的，而那墙头高的麦林，也是长在黄土岗上的。
    到了另一处，你又会看到这样的景象：那明镜一样的水田，层层叠叠，直达山顶。嫩黄的秧田，间杂其中，发出一种柔和的金黄色。水渠直从山上挂下来，银光闪闪，犹如仙人们的飘带。扑脸吹来一阵风，凉浸浸的，有股浓郁的水腥味，此时此刻，你难道还会记起你是站在鄂西北的高原上面吗？
    当然，要在这短短的篇幅里，打算勾画出今日枣阳县的整个面貌那是困难的。比如，那烟囱林立的工厂，人称“小上海”的杨壋新村，还有那散布在田野之间的、数不尽的、青砖瓦舍的“居民点”等等。我就无法一一描述了。
    但是，仅就上面所提到的一些现象说明了什么呢。如果要用一个字来概括的话，那就是一个“铺天盖地”的大“变”字。
    毛主席说得好：“穷则思变”。“变”，就是闹革命。枣阳县的人民现在就正在革天的命，革地的命，革自然的命。
    这个革命正在进行，而且越来越深入，越来越激烈。从我接触到的一些群众、干部和党的领导同志身上，深深的感到这种要求、这种力量、这种热情和那种雄心壮志，就像汹涌奔腾的黄河长江，滚滚向前，其势无比。
    枣阳的同志们对我说，要从目前全县的水库、塘堰的蓄水量来说，灌溉全县所有的土地是绰绰有余的，但是还有一些山巅岗顶浇不到，因此，他们现在突出的任务，就是要把水想尽一切办法搬到山顶上去。
    为了做到这一点，你瞧，一路一路的水利大军正在奔赴“前线”；那闷雷一样的爆破声，此起彼伏，不断传来。他们立志要把那个“铺天盖地”的大“变”字描的更大、更美。
    如果要问我悟出什么道理来的话，我只能说，枣阳县的人民所以今天干劲这样大，干的这样出色，是因为他们深深懂得这个“变”字的意义。他们懂得：要想彻底改变自己的命运，只有一个“变”。不仅要“变”，而且能够“变”，还要不断地“变”！
