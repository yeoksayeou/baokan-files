Xinhua News Agency, 8th. The Ministry of Coal Industry, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, and the Ministry of Railways are strengthening cooperation to improve the transportation of coal, ore, and pig iron, and to ensure the needs of coal and steel production for raw materials and fuel.

Recently, factories and mining enterprises in various regions have proposed to complete half of the annual output of major products in the first half of the year. A new upsurge of high production in coal and steel is being launched across the country. Therefore, the demand for production raw materials, materials, and fuel has greatly increased. Strengthening the transportation of materials such as coal, ore, and pig iron is proposed to adapt to this new situation.

The Ministry of Coal Industry, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, and the Ministry of Railways have established a joint office in Beijing to inspect and handle issues in the transportation of coal, ore, and pig iron daily. Joint offices have been established at railway bureaus and stations where coal mines, iron mines, and steel plants are located. These organizations are being improved. Those that do not have such organizations are also being established.

Because coal supply is related to all sectors of industrial and agricultural production and accounts for about 40% of the total railway transportation volume, the Ministry of Railways has particularly strengthened coal transportation. Since mid-March, in addition to the coal trucks allocated daily according to plan, the Ministry of Railways has also specially equipped more than 600 spare vehicles for 14 major coal mines every day, to be kept on standby. In late April, the Ministry of Railways also held a meeting of leading cadres from ten railway bureaus with a large volume of coal transportation to review the coal transportation situation, and decided to increase the number of spare vehicles for major coal mines to more than 1,600, and expand the scope of spare vehicles to 18 coal mines. The Ministry of Railways has also recently selected more than 20 "one-stop" transportation lines for coal and ore as key points for regular inspection. The coal and ore on these lines are all transported to major steel plants, large power plants, and coal-deficient areas.

In order to improve the transportation efficiency of coal, ore, and pig iron, the Ministry of Coal Industry, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, and the Ministry of Railways cooperate with each other to vigorously build transportation and loading and unloading equipment for coal mines, iron mines, and steel plants. With the approval of the state, the metallurgical industry departments of various provinces will allocate a portion of the pig iron produced in various regions for the construction of small railway cast rails for small and medium-sized coal mines, iron mines, and steel enterprises. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has also decided that the light steel rails produced by various steel rolling plants for coal mines will be delivered in advance in order to accelerate the construction of small railways for coal mines. The construction of coal storage yards at loading points in many coal mines is also progressing rapidly. This type of coal storage yard can not only improve loading efficiency, but some mines have also achieved "no loading for three days, production as usual; no production for three days, loading as usual," promoting balanced production and transportation. The railway department is also retrofitting some vehicles into automated bottom-opening cars to implement streamlined coal unloading, which can increase unloading efficiency by several times.

    狠抓煤炭、矿石、生铁、运输
    煤炭、冶金、铁道部成立联合办公室每天检查处理问题
    新华社8日讯　煤炭工业部、冶金工业部和铁道部加强协作，提高煤炭、矿石、生铁的运输，保证煤炭、钢铁生产对原料、燃料的需要。
    最近，各地厂矿企业纷纷提出，要在上半年完成主要产品全年产量的一半，一个夺取煤炭、钢铁高产的生产新高潮，正在各地掀起。因此，各地对生产原料、材料和燃料的需要量大大增加了。加强煤炭、矿石、生铁等物资的运输，就是适应这一新的形势提出来的。
    煤炭工业部、冶金工业部和铁道部，已经在北京成立了联合办公室，每天检查和处理煤炭、矿石、生铁运输过程中的问题。在煤矿、铁矿、钢铁厂所在地的铁路局和车站，已经成立联合办公机构的，正在健全这种机构；还没有这种机构的也正在建立。
    因为煤炭供应关系到工农业生产各个部门，又在全国铁路运输量中占有40％左右的比重，因此，铁道部特别加强了煤炭的运输。从3月中旬起，铁道部除了每天按计划调配的运煤车辆外，每天还为十四个主要煤矿专门配备了六百多辆备用车辆，留矿待用。4月下旬，铁道部又召开了十个煤炭运量很大的铁路局的领导干部会议，检查了煤炭运输情况，决定把主要煤矿的备用车辆再增加到一千六百多辆，并把备用车的配备范围扩大到十八个煤矿。铁道部最近还选择了二十多条煤炭、矿石的“一条龙”运输线，作为重点，经常检查。这些线路上的煤炭、矿石，都是运往主要钢铁厂、大型发电站和缺煤地区的。
    为了提高煤炭、矿石、生铁的运输效率，煤炭工业部、冶金工业部和铁道部互相协作，大力建设煤矿、铁矿和钢铁厂的运输装卸设备。经过国家批准，各省冶金工业部门将从各地所产的生铁中拨出一部分作为中小型煤矿、铁矿和钢铁企业修建小铁路铸轨之用；冶金工业部也已经决定，各轧钢厂为煤矿生产的轻型钢轨，将提前交货，以便加速煤矿的小铁路建设。许多煤矿在装车点上建设储煤仓的工程，进展也很快。这种储煤仓不仅可以提高装车效率，有些矿还做到了“三天不装车，照常生产；三天不生产，照常装车。”促进了生产、运输均衡地进行。铁路部门也正在把一部分车辆改装为自动化底开门车，实行卸煤滑溜化，这样可以使卸车效率提高好几倍。（附图片）
