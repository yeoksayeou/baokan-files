The Chain Reaction of Anti-Imperialist Struggle
	
	Guo Moruo

The people of Asia have stood up! The people of Africa have stood up! The people of Latin America have stood up! Awakened people are shouting in unison: Imperialism, get out! American imperialism, get out! Look, the beacons of resistance to imperialism are lighting up the sky! A raging fire of anger has spread from Seoul to Busan, terrifying that American "great patriot." The "democratic showcase" of American imperialism has been completely shattered, and interestingly, the British have declared the bankruptcy of the American lies. Look, the Turkish people are also driving away the "freedom fighters," forcing that dictator to seek death as an escape from life! The fire of anger has spread from Istanbul to Izmir, to Ankara, and is about to spread throughout Turkey. It seems that American imperialism will welcome another distinguished guest, a second Syngman Rhee! American imperialism's third Syngman Rhee is in Tokyo, openly expressing "concern" about our territory of Taiwan! However, the Japanese people will give him a clear lesson: You should be concerned about the Ogasawara Islands! You should be concerned about Okinawa! Throw that traitorous "Security Treaty" into the center of the Pacific Ocean! Shameless reactionaries are always willing to recognize a thief as their father, especially the third Syngman Rhee, whose crimes are unforgivable! He was originally a Class A war criminal, in league with Hideki Tojo, who harmed the people of Asia. He still doesn't know how to repent and wants to be an imperialist butcher of East Asia once again! Who used atomic bombs to destroy Hiroshima and Nagasaki? Who has filled Japan with military bases? Who tightly controls Japan's politics, military, and economy...? Yet they open the door to let the thieves in, forming a so-called "husband and wife" relationship (note). It is truly shameless, shameless, the third one is still shameless! No wonder the Japanese people cannot tolerate it, with ten million signatures opposing it, and I think there are more than that. The Japanese people have decided to maintain the struggle at a continuous high tide, and the Japanese people have decided to completely abolish the "Security Treaty." A treaty that has not been approved by the people is just fuel for the fire! Once the irresistible force of the people is unleashed, the chain reaction of anti-imperialist struggle spreads in all directions. The setting sun of imperialism is destined to perish. If the running dogs of imperialism are willing to be buried with it, they will only add a few more Syngman Rhees to the stage in succession! Awakened people are shouting: American imperialism, get out! I believe that fair-minded American people will also agree. If imperialism gets out of America and gets out of the world, the American people can truly reach the people's century, and all the people of the world can truly become brothers and sisters! The bright dawn has already appeared before the eyes of mankind. We cheer, for this people's spring of the sixties! For this people's spring of resolutely resisting imperialism! For this people's spring of completely eliminating colonialism! For this people's spring of striving for the total liberation of all mankind!
                            May 6, 1960

(Note) An American ambassador to Japan, upon his arrival, said at a banquet at the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo: "The relationship between the United States and Japan is a husband and wife relationship. Japan is a weak wife of the United States, and the United States should especially show affection" and so on. Informed Japanese people regarded it as a great disgrace, while the reactionary pro-American faction accepted it shamelessly.

    反帝斗争的连锁反应
    郭沫若亚洲人民站起来了！非洲人民站起来了！拉丁美洲人民站起来了！觉醒了的人民都在同声叫喊：帝国主义滚蛋！美帝国主义滚蛋！看呵，这反抗帝国主义的烽燧连天！一片愤怒的烈火从汉城燃到了釜山，把那位美国的“伟大爱国者”骇破了胆。美帝国主义的“民主橱窗”完全粉碎了，有趣的是美国佬的谎言被英国佬宣告破产。看呵，土耳其人民也要轰走“自由战士”，逼得那位独裁者求生不得，只好求死！怒火已经从伊斯坦布尔燃到伊兹密尔，燃到安卡拉，还要燃遍整个土耳其，看来美帝又会迎接一个贵宾，李承晚第二！美帝国主义的第三号李承晚是在东京，他公然对于我国领土台湾表示“关心”！然而日本人民会给他一个明白的教训：你应该关心小笠原群岛！你应该关心冲绳！把那卖国的“安全条约”抛进太平洋的中心！无耻的反动派照例是认贼作父，尤其是第三号李承晚要算罪不容诛！他本来是首级战犯与东条英机为伍，害透了亚洲人民，依然不知道悔悟，还想再一次做帝国主义的东亚屠夫！是谁用原子弹毁灭了广岛和长崎？是谁在日本国内布满了军事基地？是谁死死地控制着日本的政治、军事、经济 ……？而却开门揖盗，和强盗结成所谓“夫妻”，（注）真真是无耻，无耻，第三个还是无耻！无怪乎日本人民是断断乎忍受不了，一千万人的签名反对，我看是有多没少。日本人民已经决定要把斗争连续保持高潮，日本人民已经决定要把“安全条约”彻底废掉。得不到人民批准的条约，只是引火的材料！不可抵抗的人民力量一经得到解放，反帝斗争的连锁反应传遍了四面八方。日落西山的帝国主义注定了要灭亡，帝国主义的走狗们如果甘心殉葬，那只是多添几号李承晚连续下场！觉醒的人民都在高呼：美帝国主义滚出去！有正义感的美国人民，我相信也会同意。帝国主义如果滚出了美国，滚出了大地，美国人民才能真正到达人民的世纪，全世界人民才能真正成为姊妹兄弟！灿烂的曙光已经出现在人类的眼前，我们欢呼，为这六十年代的人民的春天！为这坚决反抗帝国主义的人民的春天！为这彻底消灭殖民主义的人民的春天！为这全人类争取总解放的人民的春天！
                            1960年5月6日作
    （注）美国的一位驻日大使，初到任时，在东京帝国饭店宴会上讲话：“美日关系是夫妻关系。日本是美国的一房病弱的妻子，美国尤其要加以爱抚”云云，日本有识者视为奇耻，而反动的亲美派则恬然受之。
