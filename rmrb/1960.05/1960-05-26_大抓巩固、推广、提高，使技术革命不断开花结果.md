    Vigorously Grasp Consolidation, Promotion, and Improvement to Make the Technological Revolution Constantly Flourish and Bear Fruit
    Cao Diqiu, Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China
    Since the beginning of this year, a technological innovation and technological revolution movement centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation has rapidly unfolded in Shanghai. This movement has gained momentum, is of grand scale, rich in content, and remarkably effective. It fully demonstrates that the people of Shanghai, like the people of the whole country, possess a strong will and great enthusiasm to conquer technological backwardness, and inexhaustible wisdom and strength to rapidly develop science and technology.
    The entire movement is a process of step-by-step development, step-by-step deepening, and step-by-step improvement. Starting from fiercely attacking manual operations, reforming tools and equipment, and achieving mechanization and semi-mechanization, it has developed to marching towards automation and semi-automation, and further developed to reforming technological processes and operating methods, creating many new technologies, new techniques, new equipment, and new products; on this basis, it has further developed to a comprehensive improvement in production organization, labor organization, enterprise management, and industrial layout. Now, the city's industrial departments have achieved more than 28,000 units of single-machine automation and semi-automation (including combined machine tools), more than 1,400 automated and semi-automated production lines, and a number of automated and semi-automated factories, workshops, and sections have begun to emerge. According to incomplete statistics, more than 300 major new technologies and new processes have been adopted and promoted since the beginning of the year. Not only has the industrial sector extensively carried out technological revolution movements, but also basic construction, transportation, finance and trade, suburban agriculture, scientific research, culture and education, and even neighborhood committees and government agencies have been swept into the torrent of this movement. Through the extensive development of the movement, the spirit of communist collaboration has been greatly promoted, and the technological revolution has developed from the past individual efforts of a few people and a few units to the joint efforts of many people and many units; from the "three-way combination" of leading cadres, workers, and technicians within the enterprise, to the "three-way combination" of enterprise employees and teachers and students of universities and colleges, scientific research personnel, and even the large-scale collaboration of the entire society, forming a collaborative network including all walks of life.
    Because the movement is on a mass scale and has brought into play the initiative of the broad masses, it has achieved immediate results. In the movement, the broad masses of workers have broken superstitions, shattered feelings of inferiority, and vigorously engaged in indigenous methods, which have shown great power, not only achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, proving the truth that "the poorer one is, the more revolutionary one becomes" and "the lowly are the most intelligent," but also producing many unique creations in science and technology and developing scientific and technological theories. Practice has proved that by implementing the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods, with indigenous methods as the mainstay, we have found a path to extensively develop science and technology and a path to accelerate socialist construction.
    All these situations show that the current technological innovation and technological revolution movement has taken on the nature of comprehensive technological transformation; it is not only a great technological revolution, but also a great ideological revolution and a great cultural revolution. This movement is a continuation and development of the socialist revolution and the socialist construction mass movement at the present stage, and is a great revolutionary mass movement. It has far-reaching significance and impact, and will play an increasingly important role in promoting the continuous development of social productive forces and promoting sustained leaps in production.
    The achievements of Shanghai's technological innovation and technological revolution movement are enormous. However, this is only a good start, and in the future, the movement must continue to be carried out in depth, continuously consolidated, promoted, and improved, so that the technological revolution will continue to blossom and bear fruit.
    At present, the focus of leadership in the technological innovation and technological revolution movement must be placed on vigorously grasping the work of consolidation, promotion, and improvement. After a high tide of technological innovation and technological revolution movement has achieved a number of results, there needs to be a stage mainly focused on consolidating the achievements of the innovation. After the degree of mechanization, semi-mechanization, and automation, and semi-automation has been improved, and a large number of new technologies, new processes, new tools, and new equipment have appeared, if they are not consolidated and promoted, the results of the innovation cannot be fully demonstrated; if they are consolidated and promoted but not improved, the results of the innovation cannot be further developed, and the movement cannot continue to move forward better. Of course, vigorously grasping consolidation, promotion, and improvement does not mean stopping the movement, but rather preparing more thoroughly, planning more effectively, and advancing the technological innovation and technological revolution movement to a new and higher stage with a greater purpose. Therefore, it is necessary to oppose two erroneous ideas: one is to be satisfied with the existing innovation results and slacken efforts, unwilling to make further arduous efforts, causing the movement to stagnate; the other is to only be satisfied with the bustling and ever-changing atmosphere, without doing solid consolidation and promotion work, and not taking consolidation, promotion, and improvement as the center of the current stage of work. Both of these ideas are inconsistent with Chairman Mao's thoughts on the theory of continuous revolution and the theory of the stages of revolutionary development.
        Vigorously grasping consolidation, promotion, and improvement is to reflect the achievements of the technological revolution in production
    Why must we vigorously grasp consolidation, promotion, and improvement at present? It should also be viewed from the purpose of carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution movements. Because, our great efforts in technological innovation and technological revolution are ultimately to develop social productive forces at high speed and promote continuous leaps in production. Therefore, all the achievements of the technological revolution should be fully reflected in production, not only to blossom, but also to bear fruit. Only in this way can we create higher production levels and labor productivity. Since the beginning of this year, Shanghai's technological innovation and technological revolution movement has greatly promoted the development of production, the industrial production capacity has greatly increased, labor productivity has also greatly improved, and a great deal of labor has been saved. But it must also be seen that many achievements of the technological revolution have not been fully reflected in production. Why is this the case? From the objective situation, the movement has not been carried out for a very long time, and there is not much experience in leading this movement, which is one of the reasons. However, it must also be seen that some departments have not done enough in consolidating, promoting, and improving technological innovation and technological revolution, and have not seized the opportunity to summarize and make the experience complete; for the less perfect innovation projects, they have not been quickly improved; in the promotion, some are not used properly, some are not accustomed to the operation, and the technology is not skilled; some are affected by the force of habit and cannot accept new things for a while, so they cannot actively overcome difficulties and master new technologies. All these affect the fact that some innovation projects cannot fully play their role, some do not blossom and bear fruit, and some blossom a lot but bear little fruit. Therefore, these phenomena must be overcome in time so that the achievements of technological innovation can be reflected in the development of production and in the improvement of labor productivity more quickly and fully.
    Consolidation, promotion, and improvement are mutually reinforcing and interrelated. By summarizing advanced experiences, consolidating existing achievements, perfecting what is imperfect, and completing what is incomplete, favorable conditions are created for promoting these experiences and achievements on a larger scale and striving for a large-scale harvest. Therefore, consolidation work is particularly important. If the innovation achievements are not consolidated, they cannot be promoted or improved. On the other hand, the process of vigorously promoting advanced technologies and advanced experiences is also a process of continuing consolidation and further improvement. After a new technology and a new experience are promoted, they will be used by various different people under various different conditions, which will inevitably develop and enrich the original advanced technology and advanced experience, so that the original technology and experience can be consolidated, developed, and improved on a larger scale. The Shanghai Lianhua Steel Strip Factory achieved steel rolling automation in seven days, but there are still three processes, namely coal adding, steel shearing, and material transportation, that have not been automated and semi-automated. The Zhabei Steel Strip Factory learned from the advanced experience of the Lianhua Factory and further realized coal adding automation, developing the advanced experience of the Lianhua Factory. The Lianhua Factory, in turn, learned from the experience of the Zhabei Factory, improved the method of automatic coal powder adding in the Zhabei Factory according to its own specific conditions, and manufactured equipment for automatic coal lump adding, while at the same time realizing steel shearing and material transportation automation and semi-automation. This fact vividly proves that vigorously promoting advanced experiences and advanced technologies in the technological innovation and technological revolution movement can not only consolidate the original achievements of the technological revolution on a larger scale, but also provide conditions for further enriching and developing the technical experience already gained.
        Adhere to the policy of indigenous methods first, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and making indigenous methods the mainstay, and vigorously launch mass movements
    How can we do a good job in consolidation, promotion, and improvement? According to our experience in the movement, we must solve two aspects of the problem, that is, we must solve the problem of ideological understanding and the problem in practical work.
    The main problem of ideological understanding to be solved at present is the issue of adhering to the policy of indigenous methods first, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and making indigenous methods the mainstay in the process of consolidation, promotion, and improvement. Indigenous methods first, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and making indigenous methods the mainstay are the characteristics of Shanghai's technological revolution movement since this year. Indigenous methods are applied in a very wide range. Not only is it indigenous methods that increase the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization, but also it is indigenous methods that automation and semi-automation are showing great power. Not only are indigenous methods used to solve general technical problems, but also indigenous methods are the mainstay for high-precision, cutting-edge technology. All these show the correctness of adhering to the policy of making indigenous methods the mainstay in the technological revolution movement. However, some people have doubts about whether indigenous methods can be the mainstay in the process of consolidation, promotion, and improvement. They believe that indigenous methods are low-level and backward methods, a temporary method adopted before there is foreign equipment and foreign methods, so they are not so enthusiastic and active about indigenous methods, but rather wait and see, always wanting to replace indigenous methods with foreign methods. This is a superstition, a manifestation of Jia Gui-style slavish thinking. We must break this superstition. A large number of facts have now proved that indigenous methods come from the rich production practice of the masses, are native-born, and are original methods that are in line with the actual production, so they are often advanced, scientific, and have strong vitality, and some even exceed foreign methods, producing unexpected economic effects. We should have a path to rapidly develop science and technology that is suitable for our country's characteristics. By combining indigenous and foreign methods, with indigenous methods as the mainstay, we can create this path. In fact, we have already found this path. Indigenous methods are generally simpler, but if we therefore regard them as unscientific, low-level, and backward, it is a formalistic view and does not explain the essence of the problem. The criteria for dividing advanced and backward, high-level and low-level, scientific and unscientific should be based on the actual effect in production. Simple is not necessarily backward. Some machines with simplified structures are actually more advanced and higher-level in terms of effectiveness. Some are still imperfect for the time being, but after continuous consolidation and improvement, they can be gradually improved and play a role in production. Therefore, it is obviously wrong to rashly think that simple is backward without examining the actual effect and without looking at the problem from the perspective of development.
    The reason why we emphasize indigenous methods is that indigenous methods are the crystallization of the wisdom of the Chinese working people. Only by adopting indigenous methods can we maximize the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses and open up a broad path for giving full play to the creative power of the masses. Of course, we must conscientiously learn all the advanced scientific and technological achievements in the world, but when learning these methods, we must creatively apply and develop them according to China's conditions, and we cannot regard foreign methods as perfect and impeccable. In fact, the laws of science and technology exist objectively and can be recognized and applied through various channels. What others can discover and apply, we can also discover and apply; what others cannot discover and apply, we can also discover and apply. As long as our direction is correct and our methods are appropriate, it is entirely possible for us to discover it, recognize it, and apply it earlier.
    Combining indigenous and foreign methods, with indigenous methods as the mainstay, is a question of the mass line and a question of whether all positive factors for developing productive forces can be fully mobilized. Without indigenous methods, there is no self-reliance, and there is no way to implement technological revolution in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way, and accelerate the prosperity and development of science and technology in our country. Therefore, we must adhere to combining indigenous and foreign methods, with indigenous methods as the mainstay.
    In the process of consolidating, promoting, and improving the achievements of the technological revolution, the practical work problems to be solved are: all effective innovation projects must be ranked, and must be quickly promoted without missing a single one. All those with universal significance should be universally promoted within the corresponding scope. In the promotion process, for the new tools, new equipment, new processes, new technologies, new products, and new materials that have been successfully tested, it is necessary to organize forces for technical appraisal, selection, finalization, and complete sets, and to universally develop single technical innovations into complete sets of technical innovations, so that the technical innovations of various enterprises, various industries, and various departments cooperate with each other to form a system. If a factory has technical or equipment manufacturing difficulties, it is necessary to organize mutual cooperation and mutual support between factories. In the promotion process, if the effect is affected due to improper use, the reasons should be studied, measures should be taken, and it should be used correctly; for those who are not accustomed to the operation for a while, the advanced technology should be quickly and effectively mastered by the broad masses of workers through technical performances, technical lessons, comparing the new and old technologies, and implementing mutual inspection, mutual comparison, and mutual exchange of experience.
    Some innovation projects that are not yet perfect should be gradually improved. For those less perfect innovation projects, the "three-way combination" of leaders, technicians, and workers should be adopted to concentrate the wisdom of the broad masses of employees and actively improve them.
    In order to further improve on the basis of consolidation and promotion, it is also necessary to adopt a method of combining mass participation and professional institutions, and mobilize scientific research institutions, universities and colleges, and factory employees to summarize and improve the new tools, new equipment, new processes, new technologies, new products, and new materials that have emerged in the movement from a theoretical point of view, so that the broad masses of employees can quickly grasp the laws of technological development and further guide practice. In this way, the technological innovation and technological revolution movement can be continuously improved on the basis of popularization, and continue to be popularized under the guidance of improvement.
    In the process of consolidation, promotion, and improvement, whether it is to solve the problem of ideological understanding or to solve the problem of practical work, it is necessary to follow the mass line and adopt the method of vigorously launching mass movements. The mass line is the fundamental line of the Party. In any work, at any time, we must adhere to implementation and cannot have the slightest negligence or wavering. When we made great efforts in technological innovation and technological revolution, we mobilized the masses, set off a climax, and achieved great results. At present, in the process of consolidation, promotion, and improvement, we must adhere to the mass line even more. Because this stage of work is more arduous, meticulous, and complex than when we first mobilized the masses to make great efforts in the technological revolution, and if this work is done well, the technological innovation and technological revolution can achieve more fruitful results. Practice has proved that the consolidation, promotion, and improvement of the achievements of technological innovation and technological revolution can be carried out vigorously, quickly, and effectively through vigorously launching mass movements; otherwise, it will be deserted, the promotion will be slow, and the effect will not be significant. At the same time, there must be dedicated personnel responsible for grasping tightly, grasping ruthlessly, and strengthening specific leadership.
        Three fruitful results that the technological revolution should bear at present
    The purpose of vigorously grasping consolidation, promotion, and improvement is to make the technological revolution continue to blossom and bear fruitful results. What kind of fruit should be borne at present?
    First, on the basis of great development in production, we must achieve one person doing the work of several people, one material doing the work of several materials, one factory doing the work of several factories, and one product doing the work of several products, to ensure the comprehensive completion and strive for the over-fulfillment of this year's planned targets for output value, output, variety, quality, and cost. If the national plan is not fully completed in the implementation of various indicators, it shows that the fruit of the technological revolution has not been borne well, and it does not meet the requirements of national construction. Now, the phenomenon of individual units simply pursuing output value has emerged and must be effectively prevented and overcome.
    Second, mass produce new products and rapidly develop high-grade, precision, and cutting-edge products.
    The rapid development of Shanghai's technological revolution this year has greatly improved the technical level of industrial production, creating very favorable conditions for the mass production of new products, the rapid development of high-grade, precision, and cutting-edge products, and the acceleration of the reform of old products. The fact that Shanghai successfully trial-produced more than 5,600 new products and improved the design and formulas of more than 720 old products in the first quarter of this year is a powerful proof. But this is only the beginning, and we should make full use of this favorable situation to make greater achievements and strive to complete the target of trial-producing more than 15,000 new products this year.
    Whether this target can be completed depends on continuing to break superstitions, emancipate the mind, establish lofty ambitions, break the old "framework" that restricts the working people from displaying their talents, and break the inferiority complex that the old society binds the working people. The Hujiang Instrument Factory is a so-called "lane factory" with only dozens of workers, but the workers of this factory are full of lofty ambitions and the revolutionary heroic spirit of no peak that cannot be climbed. They said: "What others have, we must also have, and what others do not have, we will create." The workers of the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory said: "No matter how precise your product is, it is not more precise than our brains." The Huguang Scientific Instrument Factory successfully trial-produced more than 160 new products in a very short period of time this year through making great efforts in the technological revolution. Many facts in the technological revolution movement prove that as long as the masses are fully mobilized and the style of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to do is promoted, the broad masses of working people can create more "high, precise, and cutting-edge" products from accumulated experience. What others can do in a relatively long time, we can do in a relatively short time, and what others have not done, we can also do. Old products must also be boldly reformed and constantly innovated. Old products can be changed from large to small, from complex to simple, and some can be changed from small to large, from simple to complex. For example, many instruments and meters can simplify product structure and reduce volume, and some can gradually change from single control to comprehensive control and remote control; some machine tools can be gradually replaced with new designs, some can simplify the structure, and the general-purpose machine tools can be changed to special-purpose machine tools; and some can develop from special-purpose machine tools to combined machine tools.
    We must make every effort to develop "high, precise, and cutting-edge" products at high speed. Everything that the country needs and Shanghai has the conditions to produce should be striven to create; everything that the country needs but cannot be produced in large quantities at present should be produced in large quantities as soon as possible; everything that is still a technical blank must be striven to fill. While developing "high, precise, and cutting-edge" products at high speed and boldly reforming old products, we must strive for all products to reach the first-class level in quality. The so-called first-class is not static. What is first-class today will become second-class or even third-class tomorrow if we do not work hard. The first-class that we strive for is a continuously improving first-class.
    Third, make significant achievements in the comprehensive utilization of materials. The comprehensive utilization of materials is an inevitable requirement for the further development of the technological revolution movement and is also an important indicator for measuring the achievements of the technological revolution. After the previous stage of technological innovation and technological revolution movement, the comprehensive utilization of materials in Shanghai has begun to form a widespread mass movement. The slogans of "no waste gas in the air, no waste materials on the ground, and no waste liquid underground" and "turning useless into useful and turning one use into multiple uses" have begun to take root in people's hearts. Many factories and enterprises are no longer willing to release and abandon their waste gas, waste water, and waste materials for nothing, and the broad masses of employees are racking their brains and thinking of ways to carry out the comprehensive utilization of materials, and have realized from practice that all materials themselves contain endless potential. As long as they are good at using the conditions provided by the technological innovation and technological revolution movement, they can improve their ability to conquer nature and fully utilize many resources that were not utilized in the past. In this way, the scope of comprehensive utilization of materials can become wider and wider, and the paths can become more and more numerous.
    Comprehensive utilization is a comprehensive task, and it is necessary to strengthen leadership, unify planning, pay attention to summarizing and promoting advanced experiences, especially to mobilize the masses more widely, create momentum, and further launch a mass movement for comprehensive utilization. The widespread development of comprehensive utilization can not only solve some raw material problems, but also promote the deeper and higher development of the technological revolution movement, and on this basis, develop diversified operations, give full play to the production potential in all aspects, and achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results.
        With the development of the technological revolution, it is necessary to constantly adjust the relations of production, and to make great efforts in the cultural revolution and scientific research
    In order to make the fruits of the technological revolution more abundant, it is also necessary to solve two problems brought about by the technological revolution.
    First, improve enterprise management, adjust labor organization and production organization in a timely manner. With the in-depth development of the technological revolution, the comprehensive utilization of raw materials, and the development of diversified operations, some links in enterprise management, labor organization, and production organization can no longer fully adapt to the new situation. This is manifested in: new imbalances have emerged within enterprises and between enterprises, between industries, due to the different degrees of innovation, different effects, and different technical levels; the original working hour quotas, economic indicators, and systems such as technological operations and equipment maintenance in the enterprise cannot keep up with the requirements of the continuous improvement of production level and technical level; the number of raw materials required for production has increased, the use of new raw materials has become more widespread, and the requirements for the supply of raw materials are more timely, but the original raw material supply methods and internal and external transportation work cannot keep up with this requirement; after the comprehensive utilization of raw materials is greatly carried out, the original factory buildings, site arrangements, enterprise systems, and the requirements of diversified operations are not compatible; after the degree of mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation is improved and new technologies and new processes are gradually widely adopted, the original production organization and labor organization have been disrupted and cannot adapt to the needs of new production. All these new problems that constantly emerge in the movement, if not solved in time, will affect the further development of the technological revolution movement and even hinder the sustained leap in production. Therefore, in the process of consolidation, promotion, and improvement, we must be good at discovering problems, studying them in a timely manner, and taking them seriously. Now, under the leadership of the Municipal Party Committee, Shanghai's various factories and enterprises are focusing on weak links, rewarding the advanced, helping the backward to catch up with the advanced, and constantly organizing new balances at the advanced level. At the same time, starting from the requirements of being conducive to production and conducive to vigorously launching mass movements, labor organization and production organization are adjusted, and new management systems are revised and established, so that the new management systems can not only ensure the normal progress of production, but also effectively consolidate the achievements of the technological revolution in production by formulating new working hour quotas, economic indicators, and various new rules and regulations. We believe that as long as we adhere to the spirit of rectification and continuously adjust the contradictions between the relations of production and the productive forces, and between the superstructure and the economic base, we can continuously promote the development of the technological innovation and technological revolution movement.
    Second, we must make great efforts in the cultural revolution, vigorously carry out scientific research, and rapidly expand the scientific ranks of the working class. The development of technological innovation and technological revolution has enlightened the urgent demand of the broad masses of employees to study culture and master scientific and technological knowledge. The improvement of the degree of mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation requires more and more skilled labor; the continuous emergence of new processes and new technologies and the continuous progress of production technology increasingly require producers to have a higher cultural level. The broad masses of workers need to have certain modern scientific and cultural knowledge in order to further participate in production management and technical management. In particular, the advanced technologies and advanced experiences that have emerged in the technological revolution movement must be summarized theoretically in order to further guide practice with theory. This puts a major political task before us, that is, we must make great efforts in the cultural revolution, vigorously carry out scientific research, and rapidly expand the scientific ranks of the working class. In order to adapt to the needs of production development, Shanghai must establish more scientific research institutions, expand research projects, and extensively carry out mass scientific research activities. While continuing to strive to run all levels and types of full-time schools well, we must vigorously run vocational and technical education for employees. For vocational and technical schools for employees that have already been established, we are required to consolidate and improve them on the original basis, expand the number of places, and gradually organize all employees who have the conditions to study in the unit to study. For those who have the conditions to run vocational and technical schools independently but have not yet run them, we are required to run them quickly; those who do not have the conditions to run them independently are required to strengthen cooperation and run them jointly with other units. In terms of learning content, we must both learn culture and learn technology; in order to adapt to various different levels, we must run both primary schools and secondary schools, as well as specialized colleges and even universities; we must strive to completely eliminate illiteracy among employees in the shortest possible time, and further enrich the cultural and scientific knowledge of employees. We must truly make our factories both factories, schools, and scientific research institutes, and our workers both workers, students, and scientific researchers, and rapidly realize the intellectualization of the masses of workers.
    Through the practice of this period, we have found a path for the widespread development of technological revolution. But can we follow this path to push the movement forward, carry out technological revolution in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way, and continue to blossom and bear fruit? We must also strive to study Mao Zedong Thought, follow Chairman Mao's instructions, further establish lofty ambitions, strive to be strong, continuously revolutionize, continuously improve leadership level and leadership art, and guide the movement in a timely manner. Only in this way can we make the movement advance victoriously along the correct, scientific, and national track wave after wave.

    大抓巩固、推广、提高，使技术革命不断开花结果
    中共上海市委书记　曹荻秋
    今年年初以来，一个以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革新、技术革命运动，在上海迅速展开。这个运动来势迅猛，规模壮阔，内容丰富，效果十分显著。它充分说明了上海人民和全国人民一样，蕴藏着征服技术落后的坚强意志和巨大积极性，蕴藏着迅速发展科学技术的无穷无尽的智慧和力量。
    整个运动是一步步发展，一步步深入，一步步提高的过程。从猛攻手工操作，改革工具设备，实现机械化、半机械化开始，发展到向自动化、半自动化进军，进而发展到改革工艺过程和操作方法，创造了许多新工艺、新技术、新设备、新产品；在此基础上，又进一步发展到生产组织、劳动组织、企业管理和工业布局上的全面改进。现在上海全市工业部门实现了单机自动化、半自动化（包括组合机床）二万八千多台，自动化、半自动化生产线一千四百多条，还开始出现了一批自动化、半自动化工厂、车间、工段。据不完全统计，年初以来已经采用和推广的重大新工艺、新技术有三百多项。不仅工业部门广泛开展了技术革命运动，而且基本建设、交通运输、财政贸易、郊区农业、科学研究、文化教育等各条战线，以至里弄、机关，也都卷入了这个运动的洪流。通过运动的广泛开展，共产主义协作精神大大发扬，技术革命已经从过去的少数人、少数单位的各自搞，发展到许多人、许多单位协作起来搞；从企业内部领导干部、工人和技术人员的“三结合”，发展到企业职工和大专学校师生、科学研究人员的“三结合”乃至全社会的大协作，组成了包括各行各业的协作网。
    由于运动带有全民的规模，发挥了广大群众的首创精神，因而收到了立竿见影的效果。在运动中，广大工人群众破除了迷信，打破了自卑感，大搞土法上马，土办法大显威风，不仅做到了多快好省，证明了
  “愈穷愈革命”、“卑贱者最聪明”的真理；而且出现了很多科学技术上独特的创造，发展了科学技术理论。实践证明，由于贯彻了土洋结合，以土为主的方针，我们已经找到了一条广泛发展科学技术的道路，一条加速社会主义建设的道路。
    以上这些情况表明了当前的技术革新、技术革命运动已经带有全面技术改造的性质；已经不仅是一个技术大革命，同时也是一个思想大革命，文化大革命。这个运动是社会主义革命和社会主义建设群众运动在现阶段的继续和发展，是一个伟大的革命群众运动。它具有深远的意义和影响，对推动社会生产力的不断发展、促进生产持续跃进，将发挥愈来愈大的作用。
    上海技术革新和技术革命运动的成绩是巨大的。但是，这仅仅是一个良好的开端，今后还必须把运动继续深入开展下去，不断巩固、推广、提高，使技术革命不断开花，不断结果。
    当前对技术革新和技术革命运动的领导重点，必须放在大抓巩固、推广、提高工作方面，技术革新、技术革命运动，经过一个高潮取得一批成果之后，就需要有一个以巩固革新成果为主的阶段。在机械化、半机械化和自动化、半自动化程度得到提高，以及新技术、新工艺、新工具、新设备等大批出现以后，如果不加以巩固、推广，革新的成果便不能充分显示出来，如果巩固、推广了而不提高，革新的成果又得不到新的发展，运动就不能更好地继续前进。当然，大抓巩固、推广、提高，绝不意味着要把运动停下来，而是为了更有准备、更有计划、更有目的地把技术革新和技术革命运动推进到新的更高阶段。因此，必须反对两种错误思想，一种是满足于现有的革新成果而松劲，不愿再作艰苦的努力，使运动停顿下来；另一种是只满足于轰轰烈烈、日新夜异的气氛，不去作踏踏实实的巩固、推广工作，不把巩固、推广、提高作为现阶段工作的中心。这两种思想都是不符合于毛主席关于不断革命论和革命发展阶段论的思想的。
        大抓巩固、推广、提高，是为了把技术革命的成
    就反映到生产上来
    为什么当前必须大抓巩固、推广、提高？还应当从开展技术革新和技术革命运动的目的来看。因为，我们大闹技术革新和技术革命，归根结底是为了高速度地发展社会生产力，促使生产不断跃进。因此，技术革命的一切成果，都应当充分地在生产上反映出来，不仅要开花，而且要结果，只有这样，才能创造出更高的生产水平和劳动生产率。今年以来，上海的技术革新和技术革命运动，大大地推动了生产的发展，工业的生产能力有了很大增长，劳动生产率也有很大提高，劳动力有了很大节约。但也必须看到，不少技术革命的成就还没有充分反映到生产上来，为什么会有这种现象呢？从客观形势来看，运动开展的时间还不很长，领导这个运动的经验还不多，是其原因之一。但是，还必须看到，有些部门领导上对技术革新和技术革命的巩固、推广和提高工作还做得不够，没有抓紧总结，使经验成套；对不够完善的革新项目，没有迅速加以改进；在推广时，有些由于使用不恰当，有些由于操作不习惯，技术不熟练；有些由于受习惯势力的影响，对新鲜事物一时不能接受，因而不能积极克服困难，掌握新技术。所有这些都影响到有些革新项目还不能充分发挥它的作用，有的没有开花结果，有的只开花不结果，有的开花多结果少，所以必须及时克服这些现象，才能使技术革新的成就在发展生产上、在提高劳动生产率上，更快更充分地反映出来。
    巩固、推广、提高，三者是互相促进、互相联系的。通过总结先进经验，巩固既得成果，不完善的使之完善，不成套的使之成套，就为在更大范围内推广这些经验、成果，争取大面积丰收，创造有利的条件。所以，巩固工作就显得特别重要，不把革新成果巩固下来，就无法推广，无法提高。另一方面，大力推广先进技术、先进经验的过程，同时就是一个继续巩固和进一步提高的过程。一项新技术、新经验经过推广以后，将被各种不同的人运用在各种不同的条件下，必然就会发展和丰富原有的先进技术和先进经验，使得原有的技术经验，在更大的范围内得到巩固、发展和提高。上海联华带钢厂在七天内实现了轧钢自动化，但还有加煤、剪钢、运料等三道工序没有实现自动化和半自动化，闸北带钢厂学习了联华厂的先进经验，进一步实现了加煤自动化，发展了联华厂的先进经验。联华厂又反过来学习了闸北厂的经验，根据自己的具体条件，改进了闸北厂自动加煤粉的方法，制成了自动加煤块的设备，同时实现了剪钢和运料自动化和半自动化。这一事实生动地证明了，大力推广技术革新和技术革命运动中的先进经验、先进技术，不仅可以在更大范围内巩固原有技术革命的成果，而且还能为进一步丰富和发展已经取得的技术经验提供条件。
        坚持土法上马、土洋结合、以土为主的方针，大
    搞群众运动
    怎样才能把巩固、推广、提高的工作做好呢？根据我们在运动中的体会，必须解决两方面的问题，即既要解决思想认识问题，又要解决实际工作中的问题。
    当前要解决的思想认识问题，主要是在巩固、推广、提高过程中，关于坚持土法上马，土洋结合，以土为主的方针问题。土法上马，土洋结合，以土为主，是今年以来上海的技术革命运动的特色，土办法应用的范围非常广泛，不但提高机械化、半机械化程度是土法上马，而且实现自动化、半自动化，也是土办法大显威风，不仅解决一般技术问题用土办法，而且搞高精尖，也是以土为主。这些都说明了在技术革命运动中坚持以土为主方针的正确性。但有些人在巩固、推广、提高过程中，对能不能以土为主有着怀疑。他们认为土办法是低级的、落后的办法，是一种在没有洋设备、洋办法之前所暂时采用的办法，因而对土办法不是那么热心、积极，而是等待观望，总是想用洋办法来代替土办法，这是一种迷信，是贾桂式的奴才思想的表现。我们必须打破这种迷信。现在大量事实已经证明，土办法是从群众的丰富的生产实践中来的，是土生土长的，是切合生产实际的独创办法，因而它往往是先进的、科学的、有强大生命力的，有些甚至超过洋办法，产生意想不到的经济效果。我们应该有适合我国特点的迅速发展科学技术的道路。土洋结合，以土为主，我们就能够创造出这条道路。事实上，我们已经找到了这条道路。土办法一般比较简单，但如果因此而把它看作是不科学的、低级的、落后的，则是一种形式主义的看法，并不能说明问题的本质。先进与落后，高级与低级，科学与不科学，划分的标准应当看生产上的实际效果。简单的并不一定是落后的，有些结构简化了的机器，从效能上看，实际上是更先进、更高级的。有些虽然暂时还是不完善的，但经过不断巩固、提高，是可以逐步完善起来，在生产上发挥作用的。因此，不考察实际效果，不从发展上看问题，贸然认为简单就是落后，显然是错误的。
    我们所以强调土办法，是因为土办法是我国劳动人民的聪明智慧的结晶，只有采用土办法，才能最大限度地调动广大群众的积极性和创造性，打开充分发挥群众创造力量的广阔道路。我们固然要认真学习世界上一切先进的科学技术成就，但是学习这些办法，必须根据中国的条件加以创造性的运用和发展，不能把洋办法看做是尽善尽美的，一点也不能突破。其实，科学技术规律是客观存在的，是可以通过各种途径去认识和运用的。人家能发现、能运用的，我们也能发现、能运用；人家不能发现、不能运用的，我们也可以去发现、去运用。只要我们方向对头、方法恰当，就完全有可能更早地去发现它，认识它，运用它。
    土洋结合，以土为主，是一个群众路线问题，是能不能把发展生产力的一切积极因素充分调动起来的问题。没有土办法，就谈不到自力更生，就谈不到多快好省地实行技术革命，加速推动我国科学技术的繁荣和发展。因此，必须坚持土洋结合，以土为主。
    在巩固、推广、提高技术革命成果的过程中，要解决的实际工作问题是：凡是行之有效的革新项目都要进行排队，必须一条不漏地迅速推广，凡是有普遍意义的，都应在相应的范围内普遍推广。在推广过程中，对于已经试验成功的新工具、新设备、新工艺、新技术、新产品、新材料，要组织力量进行技术鉴定、选型、定型、配套成龙，要普遍地使单项的技术革新发展成为成套的技术革新，使各个企业、各个行业、各个部门的技术革新互相配合，形成系统，一个厂在技术上或在设备制造上有困难的，要组织厂与厂之间的相互协作，相互支持。在推广过程中，由于使用不恰当，影响到它的效果的，应该研究原因，采取措施，把它正确地使用起来；对于一时操作不习惯的，应该通过技术表演，上技术课，进行新旧技术对比算账，实行互查互比，互相交流经验，迅速有效地使先进技术为广大工人群众所掌握。
    有些革新项目还不完善的，要逐步使之完善。对于那些不够完善的革新项目要采取领导人员、技术人员和工人“三结合”的方式，集中广大职工群众的智慧，积极加以改进。
    要在巩固、推广的基础上进一步加以提高，还必须采取群众性与专业机关相结合的办法，动员科学研究机关、大专学校、工厂职工，把运动中涌现出来的新工具，新设备、新工艺、新技术、新产品、新材料，分门别类地从理论上加以总结提高，使广大职工群众迅速掌握技术发展的规律，进一步指导实践，这样，技术革新和技术革命运动就能在普及的基础上不断提高，在提高的指导下继续普及。
    在巩固、推广、提高过程中，无论解决思想认识问题，或是解决实际工作问题，都要走群众路线，采取大搞群众运动的办法。群众路线是党的根本路线。在任何工作中，任何时候，都必须坚持贯彻执行，不能有丝毫疏忽和动摇。我们在大闹技术革新和技术革命时，发动了群众，掀起了高潮，取得了很大成绩，目前在巩固、推广、提高过程中，更必须坚持群众路线。因为这一阶段的工作，比开始发动群众大闹技术革命时，更为艰巨、细致和复杂，而做好这个工作，技术革新和技术革命就能取得更为丰硕的果实。实践证明：技术革新和技术革命成果的巩固、推广和提高，通过大搞群众运动，就能搞得轰轰烈烈，迅速而有成效；否则，就是冷冷清清，推广不快，效果不显著。同时还必须有专人负责，抓紧，抓狠，加强具体领导。
        技术革命在目前应当结出的三个硕果
    大抓巩固、推广、提高的目的在于要使技术革命不断开花并结出丰硕的果实。在目前应该结什么果呢？
    第一，要在生产大发展的基础上，做到一个人顶几个人用，一份材料顶几份材料用，一个厂顶几个厂用，一件产品顶几件产品用，保证全面完成和争取超额完成今年的产值、产量、品种、质量和成本等计划指标。如果执行国家计划时，不能全面地完成各项指标，那就说明技术革命的果没有结好，也是不符合国家建设的要求的。现在个别单位单纯追求产值的现象已经露头，必须切实加以防止和克服。
    第二，大量试制新产品，高速度地发展高级、精密、尖端产品。
    今年上海技术革命的迅速发展，大大提高了工业生产的技术水平，为大量试制新产品，高速度发展高级、精密、尖端产品，以及加速改革老产品，创造了十分有利的条件。今年第一季度上海共试制成功新产品五千六百多种，老产品改进设计配方的有七百二十多种，就是有力的证明。但这也仅仅是个开始，我们应该充分运用这个有利形势，做出更大的成绩，争取完成今年试制新产品一万五千多种的指标。
    能否完成这个指标，关键在于继续破除迷信，解放思想，树立雄心壮志，打破限制劳动人民施展聪明才智的旧“框框”，打破旧社会束缚劳动人民的自卑感。沪江仪器厂是一个只有几十个工人的所谓“弄堂工厂”，但这个厂的工人充满着雄心壮志和无高不可攀的革命英雄气概，他们说：
  “人家有的，我们也要有，人家没有的，我们来创造”。上海机床厂工人说：“任你产品怎样精密，总没有我们的头脑更精密”。沪光科学仪器厂在今年通过大闹技术革命，在很短时间内就试制成功了一百六十多种新产品。技术革命运动中的许多事实证明了，只要充分发动群众，发扬敢想敢说敢做的风格，广大劳动群众完全可以从日积月累的经验中创造出更多的“高、精、尖”产品，别人用比较长的时间才能做到的事情，我们可以用比较短的时间做到，别人没有做到的事情，我们也可以做到。对老产品也必须大胆改革，不断推陈出新。老产品，可以由大到小，由繁到简，另有一些可以由小到大，由简到繁。例如，仪器仪表有许多可以简化产品结构、缩小体积，有些可以逐步由单一控制改为综合控制和遥远控制；机床有些可以逐步换成新型设计，有些可以简化结构，把通用机床改为专用机床；还有一些可以从专用机床向组合机床的方向发展。
    我们一定要尽最大努力高速度地发展“高、精、尖”产品、凡是国家需要而上海又有条件生产的，都应该努力把它创造出来；凡是国家需要而目前还未能大量生产的，要尽快地大量生产出来；凡是技术上还是空白的，一定要努力把它补上。在高速度发展“高、精、尖”产品、大胆改革老产品的同时，力争所有产品质量都达到第一流水平。所谓第一流，不是一成不变的，今天是第一流的，如果不努力，明天就会变成第二流甚至第三流了。我们所争取的第一流是不断提高的第一流。
    第三，在物资的综合利用上，做出显著成绩。物资的综合利用，是技术革命运动进一步发展的必然要求，也是衡量技术革命成果的重要标志之一。经过前一阶段的技术革新和技术革命运动，上海的物资综合利用已经开始形成为广泛的群众运动。“空中无废气、地上无废料、地下无废液”、“变无用为有用、变一用为多用”等口号开始深入人心。许多工厂企业都不肯再把本单位的废气、废水、废料白白放出去和抛弃了，广大职工都在动脑筋、想办法，进行物资的综合利用，并且从实践中认识到，一切物资本身都蕴藏着无穷无尽的潜力，只要善于运用技术革新和技术革命运动所提供的条件，就可以提高征服自然的本领，把许多过去没有被利用的资源都充分利用起来。这样，就可以使物资综合利用的范围愈来愈广，门路愈来愈多。
    综合利用是一项综合性的任务，必须加强领导、统一规划，注意总结和推广先进经验，特别是要更广泛地发动群众，造成声势，进一步掀起一个大搞综合利用的群众运动。综合利用的广泛开展，不仅可以解决某些原材料问题，而且可以促进技术革命运动的更加深入和更加提高，并在此基础上，发展多种经营，充分发挥各方面的生产潜力，做到更加多快好省。
        随着技术革命的发展，要不断调整生产关系，要
    大闹文化革命和科学研究
    为了使技术革命的果结得更加丰硕，还必须解决技术革命带来的两个问题。
    一、及时改进企业管理、调整劳动组织和生产组织；随着技术革命的深入发展，原材料的综合利用，多种经营的发展，企业管理、劳动组织和生产组织上的某些环节已经不能完全适应新的形势。这表现在：企业内部和企业与企业、行业与行业之间，由于革新程度不一，效果不一，技术水平不一，因而出现了新的不平衡；企业中原有的工时定额、经济指标和工艺操作、设备检修等制度，跟不上生产水平、技术水平不断提高的要求；生产上需要的原材料数量增加，新原料的采用更加广泛，对原材料的供应要求更加及时，而原来的原材料供应方法、厂内厂外运输工作跟不上这个要求；大搞原材料的综合利用以后，原有的厂房建筑、场地安排、企业体制和多种经营的要求不相适应；机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化的程度提高和新技术、新工艺逐步被广泛采用以后，原有的生产组织、劳动组织已经被打乱，不能适应新的生产的需要。所有这些在运动中不断地出现的新问题，如果不及时解决，就会影响技术革命运动的进一步发展，以致阻碍生产的持续跃进。因此，在巩固、推广、提高的过程中，都必须善于发现问题，及时研究，认真对待。现在，上海各工厂企业正在市委的领导下，大抓薄弱环节，奖励先进，帮助后进赶上先进，不断地在先进的水平上组织新的平衡。同时，从有利于生产、有利于大搞群众运动的要求出发，调整劳动组织和生产组织，修订和建立新的管理制度，使新的管理制度不仅能保证生产的正常进行，而且通过制定新的工时定额、经济指标及各种新的规章制度，使技术革命的成果切实在生产上巩固起来。我们认为，只要坚持整风精神，不断地调整生产关系和生产力之间、上层建筑和经济基础之间的矛盾，我们就能够持续不断地推动技术革新和技术革命运动的发展。
    二、必须大闹文化革命、大搞科学研究，迅速扩大工人阶级的科学队伍。技术革新和技术革命的开展，启发了广大职工学习文化、掌握科学技术知识的迫切要求。机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化程度的提高，对熟练劳动的需要愈来愈大；新工艺、新技术的不断出现，生产技术的不断进步，愈来愈要求生产者具有更高的文化水平。工人群众要进一步参加生产管理和技术管理，需要具备一定的现代科学文化知识。特别是对技术革命运动中出现的先进技术、先进经验，要从理论上加以总结，以便进一步用理论指导实践。这就在我们面前提出了一项重大政治任务，就是必须大闹文化革命，大搞科学研究，迅速扩大工人阶级的科学队伍。为了适应生产发展的需要，上海要建立更多的科学研究机构，扩大研究项目，并广泛开展群众性的科学研究活动。在继续努力办好各级各类全日制学校的同时，要大办职工业余教育。对于已经办起来的职工业余学校，要求在原有基础上加以巩固提高，并扩大名额，逐步做到把本单位有条件学习的职工统统组织起来学习。对于有条件单独举办的业余学校而还没有办起来的，要求迅速办起来；没有条件单独举办的，要求加强协作，和其他单位联合举办。在学习内容上，做到既学文化，又学技术；为适应各种不同程度，既办小学、中学，又办专科以至大学；力争在最短期间，彻底扫除职工中的文盲，并进一步丰富职工的文化科学知识。真正做到我们的工厂既是工厂、又是学校、又是科学研究所，我们的工人既是工人、又是学生、又是科学研究员，迅速实现工人群众的知识化。
    通过这个时期的实践，我们已经找到一条技术革命广泛发展的道路。但能否循着这条道路把运动推向前进，多快好省地开展技术革命，不断开花结果？还必须努力学习毛泽东思想，遵照毛主席的指示，进一步树立雄心大志，发奋图强，不断革命，不断提高领导水平和领导艺术，及时指导运动。只有这样，才能使运动一浪高一浪地沿着正确的科学的全民的轨道胜利前进。
