Xinhua News Agency, 9th May. The Czechoslovak Ambassador to China, Bušniak, held a grand reception at the Beijing Hotel this evening to warmly celebrate the 15th anniversary of the liberation of Czechoslovakia. Chinese Party and state leaders Zhu De, Lin Biao, Deng Xiaoping, Peng Zhen, He Long and others attended the reception.

Ambassador Bušniak spoke first at the reception, which was filled with a festive atmosphere. He said that in the fifteen years since liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Czechoslovak people have achieved the victory of socialism, the social system for which our workers and other laborers have long struggled.

The Ambassador spoke about the recent discussion of the new constitution by the Czechoslovak people. He said that this constitution will not only consolidate the achievements of the socialist transformation in our country, but will also become the cornerstone of our country's transition to communism. He said that the reason we have been able to achieve these successes is because our country is a strong link in the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

Speaking of the international situation, the Ambassador condemned US imperialism and other imperialists for creating international tensions, condemned US imperialism for occupying China's territory of Taiwan, and for supporting the revival of Japanese and German militarism. He said that the recent intrusion of a US military aircraft into Soviet airspace was a new provocation against the Soviet Union and all socialist countries. The people of the world must remain vigilant at all times.

Ambassador Bušniak warmly praised the great achievements made by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party in the general line of socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes. He said that the achievements made by the People's Republic of China in less than eleven years have attracted the attention of the people of the world. The people of all countries give high praise to the peace-loving foreign policy of the People's Republic of China.

In praising Czechoslovak-Chinese friendship, the Ambassador said that we are happy about the strong friendship between the fraternal Czechoslovak and Chinese peoples. Our friendship is based on the principles of proletarian internationalism and the principles of Marxism-Leninism, and it is firm and unbreakable.

Vice Premier He Long then spoke, celebrating the 15th anniversary of the liberation of Czechoslovakia. He said that the fraternal Czechoslovak people, with the help of the heroic Soviet army, have completely changed the face of their motherland in only fifteen years, and have built Czechoslovakia into a socialist power with a high level of industrialization. Last year, the Czechoslovak Communist Party put forward instructions for the Third Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy, showing the people of the whole country a more beautiful future. The Czechoslovak people will surely victoriously complete this glorious task.

Vice Premier He Long said that in the past fifteen years, Czechoslovakia has made many contributions to consolidating the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. Czechoslovakia firmly pursues a peaceful foreign policy, and it is carrying out an unremitting struggle against the aggressive and war policies of US imperialism, against the arms expansion and war preparations of West German militarism, and for easing international tensions and safeguarding peace in Europe and the world. All this makes Czechoslovakia play an increasingly important role in international affairs.

Vice Premier He Long said that under the brilliant light of Marxism-Leninism, the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries have been constantly developing. In the future, with the continuous progress of the socialist construction undertakings in our two countries, the fraternal friendship between our two countries will surely be further developed, and our mutual assistance and cooperation in the political, economic, cultural, scientific and technological fields will surely be closer.

After Ambassador Bušniak and Vice Premier He Long spoke, the band played the national anthems of China and Czechoslovakia respectively.

The head of the Czechoslovak Friendship Delegation, Josef Обavský, toasted at the reception. He proposed a toast to the consolidation of unity and cooperation between the people of China and Czechoslovakia.

Also invited to the reception were Vice Premiers of the State Council Luo Ruiqing and Xi Zhongxun, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Shen Junru, Chen Shutong, Cheng Qian, and Lin Feng, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Bao Erhan, Vice Ministers of Foreign Affairs Luo Guibo and Geng Biao, President of the Sino-Czechoslovak Friendship Association Xia Yan, etc. Also invited were heads of various departments of the government, various people's organizations, various democratic parties, senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, heads of Beijing Municipality, people from all walks of life in the capital, as well as diplomatic envoys and diplomatic officials of various countries stationed in China.

　　新华社9日讯　捷克斯洛伐克驻中国大使布希尼亚克，今晚在北京饭店举行盛大招待会，热烈庆祝捷克斯洛伐克解放十五周年。我国党和国家的领导人朱德、林彪、邓小平、彭真、贺龙等出席了招待会。
　　布希尼亚克大使在充满节日气氛的招待会上首先讲话。他说，在解放以来的十五年中，捷克斯洛伐克人民在共产党的领导下，取得了我国工人和其他劳动者长期为之奋斗的社会制度——社会主义的胜利。
    大使讲到捷克斯洛伐克人民最近对于新宪法的讨论。他说，这部宪法不仅将我国生活中社会主义变革的成果固定下来，并且将成为我国向共产主义过渡的基石。他说，我们所以能取得这些成就，是由于我国是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的坚强一环。
    讲到国际形势时，大使谴责美国帝国主义和其他帝国主义者制造国际紧张局势，谴责美帝国主义侵占中国的领土台湾，扶植日本和德国军国主义复活。他说，最近美国军事飞机侵入苏联领空，这是对苏联和所有社会主义国家的一个新的挑衅。全世界人民必须始终警惕。
    布希尼亚克大使热情地赞扬了中国人民在中国共产党领导下，在建设社会主义总路线、大跃进和人民公社方面所获得的伟大成就。他说，中华人民共和国成立不到十一年中取得的成就，吸引着全世界人民的注意力。各国人民给予中华人民共和国爱好和平的外交政策以崇高的评价。
    大使在称颂捷中友谊时说，兄弟般的捷中两国人民的坚强友谊，使我们感到幸福。我们的友谊是以无产阶级国际主义原则和马克思列宁主义原则为基础，它是牢固和不可动摇的。
    贺龙副总理接着讲话，庆祝捷克斯洛伐克解放十五周年。他说，兄弟的捷克斯洛伐克人民，在英勇的苏军帮助下获得解放以后，仅用了十五年的时间，便彻底地改变了自己祖国的面貌，把捷克斯洛伐克建设成为一个具有高度工业水平的社会主义强国。去年，捷克斯洛伐克共产党提出了第三个发展国民经济的五年计划指示，给全国人民展示了更加美好的前景。捷克斯洛伐克人民一定会胜利地完成这一光荣的任务。
    贺龙副总理说，十五年来，捷克斯洛伐克为巩固以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，作出了不少的贡献。捷克斯洛伐克坚定地奉行着和平外交政策，它为反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，反对西德军国主义的扩军备战，为缓和国际紧张局势，维护欧洲和世界和平进行着坚持不渝的斗争。这一切使得捷克斯洛伐克在国际事务中起着日益重要的作用。
    贺龙副总理说，在马克思列宁主义的光辉照耀下，我们两国的友好合作关系一直在不断发展。今后随着两国社会主义建设事业的不断前进，我们两国兄弟般的友谊，一定会得到进一步的发展，我们两国在政治、经济、文化和科学技术方面的互助合作关系也一定会更加紧密。
    布希尼亚克大使和贺龙副总理讲话后，乐队分别高奏中国和捷克斯洛伐克国歌。
    捷克斯洛伐克友好代表团团长约瑟夫·奥巴夫斯基在招待会上祝酒。他提议为捷中两国人民的巩固团结和合作干杯。
    应邀出席招待会的，还有国务院副总理罗瑞卿、习仲勋，人大常委会副委员长沈钧儒、陈叔通、程潜、林枫，政协全国委员会副主席包尔汉，外交部副部长罗贵波、耿飚，中捷友好协会会长夏衍等。应邀出席的，还有政府各部门、各人民团体、各民主党派的负责人，中国人民解放军高级将领，北京市的负责人，首都各方面的人士，以及各国驻中国的使节和外交官员。（附图片）
