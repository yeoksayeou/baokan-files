Xinhua News Agency, 18th: The person in charge of the Central Patriotic Health Campaign Committee recently told Xinhua News Agency reporters that all regions must continue to build momentum on the basis of the unprecedented scale and great achievements of the spring patriotic health campaign, conduct extensive publicity, eliminate the four pests, emphasize hygiene, engage in disease prevention and eradication, and deepen the summer patriotic health campaign in the direction of high-speed, high-standard, and large-area harvests. This is to protect the health of the people and, at the same time, lay a good foundation for the sustained leap forward in health work this year and in the next two years.

The person in charge said that, according to the current booming situation of collective production and collective life welfare undertakings, in terms of hygiene, the first priority should be to do a good job in the hygiene of collective life centered on public canteens, and strengthen the hygiene management of canteens and the catering industry. All catering industries, food processing industries, train dining cars, and ship dining rooms must have various equipment for preventing flies, dust, and spoilage, and must always maintain cleanliness during operation, implement tableware disinfection, and provide universal hygiene knowledge training for cooks and catering industry personnel. The sale and consumption of rotten and spoiled food must be strictly prohibited to prevent the occurrence of intestinal infectious diseases and food poisoning. In terms of environmental hygiene, the most important thing at present is to strengthen the management and harmless treatment of feces, garbage, and sewage, and drinking water sources must be strictly protected to avoid pollution from feces and sewage. In terms of occupational hygiene, labor protection and safety hygiene work in factories, mines, construction sites, and fields should be done well, measures to prevent heatstroke and cool down temperatures and prevent work-related injuries should be strengthened, and attention should be paid to the combination of work and rest to ensure sufficient sleep and rest time. In terms of personal hygiene, various measures should be taken to improve the public's level of hygiene knowledge, cultivate the public's good habits of loving cleanliness and paying attention to hygiene, and promote washing hands before meals and after using the toilet, not eating unclean food, not drinking raw water, using separate chopsticks and dishes, and using separate basins and towels for brushing teeth and gargling. Large and medium-sized cities should launch a campaign to dissuade people from spitting everywhere and eliminate the phenomenon of spitting everywhere. Both urban and rural areas should carry out extensive and diverse sports activities to enhance the people's physical fitness.

The person in charge pointed out that vigorously preventing summer and autumn infectious diseases and heatstroke poisoning is a central task of the summer patriotic health campaign. In addition to requiring all relevant departments and units to take effective measures to prevent heatstroke and food poisoning and work-related injuries, it is particularly important to prevent the occurrence and spread of diseases such as typhoid fever, paratyphoid fever, dysentery, infectious hepatitis, poliomyelitis, and epidemic encephalitis B. All medical and health personnel must be organized to go deep into factories, mines, workshops, construction sites, and fields to prevent disease in the absence of disease, and to treat diseases in a timely manner when they occur, so as to greatly reduce the incidence of these diseases and strive for the emergence of more units and regions without these infectious diseases.

The person in charge said that doing a good job in the summer patriotic health campaign is very important for ensuring the current production and construction and completing the task of eliminating pests and diseases as stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program. All regions must consolidate the achievements on the basis of the great achievements made in the spring mass health campaign, and further expand the results, so that the summer health campaign can be done better and achieve greater victories. To this end, patriotic health campaign committees and health administrative departments at all levels should, under the leadership of party committees at all levels, formulate specific plans and measures for the summer health campaign, and quickly implement the plans and measures at the grassroots level. Relevant departments and groups of the central government should continue to strengthen the leadership of the health work of their affiliated systems, and frequently check and supervise. Advanced regions and units should move towards higher standards with the spirit of continuous revolution. Health and medical workers should work harder to prepare for the elimination of pests and diseases in summer and autumn.

    中央爱国卫生运动委员会负责人发表谈话
    继续深入开展夏季爱国卫生运动
    以公共食堂为中心搞好卫生工作，把预防夏季传染病和中暑中毒作为中心任务
    据新华社18日讯　中央爱国卫生运动委员会负责人最近向新华社记者发表谈话说，各地必须在春季爱国卫生运动规模空前、成绩巨大的基础上，继续大造声势，大做宣传，大除四害，大讲卫生，大搞防病和灭病，向着高速度、高标准、大面积丰收的方向深入开展夏季爱国卫生运动，以保护人民的健康，同时，为今年和今后两年卫生工作的持续跃进打好基础。
    负责人说，根据当前集体生产和集体生活福利事业的蓬勃发展形势，在讲卫生方面，首先应搞好以公共食堂为中心的集体生活的卫生工作，加强食堂、饮食行业的卫生管理。各饮食行业、食品加工业、火车餐车、轮船餐间都要做到有防蝇、防尘、防腐蚀变质的各种设备，经常保持操作中的清洁卫生，实行食具消毒，炊事人员和饮食行业人员都要普遍进行卫生知识训练。要严加禁止销售与食用腐烂变质食物，以防止肠道传染病和食物中毒的发生。环境卫生，目前最重要的是加强粪便、垃圾、污水的管理和无害化处理工作，饮水源一定要严加保护，避免粪便污水污染。劳动卫生，要做好厂矿、工地、田间的劳动保护和安全卫生工作，加强防暑降温、预防工伤事故的措施，并切实注意劳逸结合，保证有足够的睡眠和休息时间。个人卫生，要采取各种措施提高群众的卫生知识水平，培养群众爱清洁、讲卫生的良好习惯，提倡饭前便后洗手、不吃不洁食物、不喝生水、分筷分食和分盆分巾刷牙漱口。大中城市要开展劝阻随地吐痰的运动，消灭随地吐痰的现象。无论城乡都要开展广泛的多样的体育活动，以增强人民的体质。
    负责人指出，大力预防夏秋季传染病和中暑中毒的工作，是夏季爱国卫生运动的一项中心任务。除了要求各有关部门、单位采取有效措施防止高温中暑和食物中毒、工伤事故外，当前要特别防止伤寒、副伤寒、痢疾、传染性肝炎、脊髓灰白质炎、流行性乙型脑炎等疾病的发生和流行，一切医药卫生人员要有组织地深入到厂矿、车间、工地、田间进行无病防病，有病及时治疗，做到大大降低这些疾病的发病率，争取出现更多的没有这些传染病的单位和地区。
    负责人说，搞好夏季爱国卫生运动，对保障当前的生产建设和完成全国农业发展纲要中所规定的除害灭病任务，都是十分重要的。各地一定要在春季群众卫生运动取得巨大成绩的基础上，巩固成绩，并进一步扩大战果，把夏季卫生运动搞得更好，取得更大的胜利。为此，各级爱国卫生运动委员会和卫生行政部门要在各级党委领导下，订出夏季卫生运动的具体规划和措施，迅速地将规划和措施落实到基层。中央各有关部门和团体要继续加强对所属系统卫生工作的领导，并经常检查督促。各先进地区和单位要以不断革命的精神向更高的标准前进。卫生医药工作者要更加努力作好夏秋季除害灭病的准备工作。
