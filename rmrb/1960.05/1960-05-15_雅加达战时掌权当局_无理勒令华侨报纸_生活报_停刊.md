Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 14th: Jakarta news: Lieutenant Edi, a spokesman for the Jakarta wartime authorities, announced on the 12th that the Commander of the Indonesian Fifth Military Region, in his capacity as the Jakarta wartime authority, had ordered the Jakarta Overseas Chinese newspaper "Life Daily" to cease publication from the 13th.

He said the reason for the closure was that the newspaper had published news with "extreme bias" on May 6th, 9th and 11th, and had "deliberately" published news contrary to the Indonesian Attorney General Gunawan's remarks regarding the Chinese ships sent to "transport Overseas Chinese back to China escaping Indonesian territorial waters." The spokesman groundlessly said that these news items "may disrupt security and public order."

"Life Daily" had published a statement issued by the Chinese Consulate General in Jakarta on May 3rd, which refuted the allegation made by the Indonesian Attorney General's Office that Chinese ships transporting repatriated Overseas Chinese had "escaped Indonesian territorial waters," pointing out that it was a complete fabrication. On the same day, the newspaper also published a report by Antara News Agency regarding Attorney General Gunawan's remarks.

Prior to the closure of this Overseas Chinese newspaper, the Indonesian authorities had already stopped supplying newsprint to Overseas Chinese newspapers, and some Overseas Chinese newspapers were forced to close down, while others were forced to reduce their size.

    雅加达战时掌权当局
    无理勒令华侨报纸“生活报”停刊
    新华社14日讯　雅加达消息：雅加达战时掌权当局发言人埃迪中尉12日宣布，印度尼西亚第五军区司令以雅加达战时掌权者身份已经勒令雅加达华侨报纸“生活报”从13日起停止出版。
    他说，勒令停刊的理由是这家报纸在5月6日、9日和11日刊载了具有“极大倾向性”的消息，并且“故意”刊载了同印度尼西亚最高检察长贡纳万关于中国所派遣的“接运华侨回国的船只逃出了印度尼西亚领海”的谈话相反的消息。这位发言人毫无根据地说，这些消息“可能扰乱安全和公共秩序”。
      “生活报”曾经在6日刊登了中国驻雅加达总领事馆5月3日发表的一篇声明，其中驳斥了印度尼西亚最高检察署发布的所谓中国接运归国华侨的船只“逃出了印度尼西亚领海”的说法，指出了那完全是捏造。这家报纸同一天也刊登了安塔拉通讯社有关最高检察长贡纳万的谈话的报道。
    在这家华侨报纸被勒令停刊以前，印度尼西亚当局已经停止向华侨报纸供应新闻纸，华侨报纸有的被迫停刊，有的被迫减小版面。
