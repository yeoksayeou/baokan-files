Offshore "Three-Purpose Machine" Saves Labor and Effort

    The employees of the Waihai (Outer Sea) Business Station of Fenghua Transportation Company have successfully created a "three-purpose machine." In the past, ships sailing offshore relied on manpower to raise anchors, pull sails, and lift booms, requiring twenty people per ship. After using this machine, raising anchors, pulling sails, and lifting booms can all be done by machine, and only seven people are needed per ship, increasing work efficiency by two times and greatly reducing labor intensity.

    外海“三用机”省人又省力
    奉化运输公司外海营业站的职工，创造成功了一种“三用机”。过去船只在外海航行中起锚、拔篷、吊杆都依靠人力，一只船需要二十个人。使用这台机器以后，起锚、拔篷、吊杆都可以用机器来代替，一只船只要七个人就够了，提高工效两倍，而且还大大减轻了劳动强度。
