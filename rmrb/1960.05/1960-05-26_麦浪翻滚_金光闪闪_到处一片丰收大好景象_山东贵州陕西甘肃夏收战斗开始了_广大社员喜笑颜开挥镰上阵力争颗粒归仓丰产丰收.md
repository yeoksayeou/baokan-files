    Wheat Fields Billow, Golden Light Shimmers, A Great Scene of Abundant Harvests Everywhere
    Summer Harvesting Battle Begins in Shandong, Guizhou, Shaanxi, and Gansu
    Broad Masses of Commune Members, Faces Full of Joy, Take Up Sickles and Go into Battle, Striving for Every Grain to Return to the Granary, High Yield and Bumper Harvest
    Jinan Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 25th – Shandong Province, one of China’s major wheat-producing regions, has already kicked off the prelude to a major summer harvest. In the early-maturing areas of the Yimeng Mountain region in central and southern Shandong, the vast plains of southwestern Shandong, and in areas like Jinan City, individual communes and teams have already started harvesting.
    This year, although Shandong Province has experienced very severe drought, wheat is growing well. Under the leadership of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the heroic people of Shandong launched a vigorous battle to combat drought, sow wheat, and protect wheat from drought, starting last autumn. They excavated groundwater, expanded water sources, and rationally utilized surface water, conquering the drought demon. The sown area increased by more than ten million mu compared to last year, and large-scale high-yielding wheat areas have developed to over thirty million mu. Whether in the vast plains of western Shandong irrigated by the Yellow River Weishan Irrigation Area, or in the undulating hills of the Jiaodong Peninsula, or in the rugged Yimeng Mountain region of central and southern Shandong, or in the newly reclaimed alkaline wasteland along the coast of the Bohai Sea, everywhere wheat fields are billowing, a golden expanse, presenting a scene of abundant harvest.
    In order to win the final battle for a major wheat harvest, in light of the large wheat planting area and good wheat ears this year, Shu Tong, First Secretary of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Pei Mengfei, Secretary of the Secretariat, personally took command. Party committees at the provincial, regional, and people's commune levels throughout the province universally established command posts, deciding to allocate more than 80% of the labor force to the battle. Threshing equipment, rapid harvesters, sickles, and small carts prepared by the industrial and commercial sectors are being continuously transported to the people's communes for use.
    Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 25th – As of the 15th, Guizhou Province has rushed to harvest more than 6.08 million mu of wheat, rapeseed, and miscellaneous grain crops, five times more than the same period last year.
    This year, the summer harvest area in Guizhou Province has expanded many times over, crops have matured uniformly, and the spring sowing tasks are heavy, resulting in a relatively tight labor situation. However, various localities have fully utilized the superiority of the people's commune being large in size and public in nature, and have extensively organized large-scale cooperation based on the principle of equal exchange, with the production team as the unit. They have adopted a flow-line operation method, closely linking the various links of harvesting, threshing, drying, transporting, and warehousing, thereby making the summer harvest proceed quickly and well.
    Many areas' government offices, schools, and military units have organized rush harvesting teams to assist the people's communes in crash harvesting.
    From Our Newspaper – According to the Shaanxi Daily: Shaanxi Province's first battle for a bumper harvest this year has begun. In the Ankang Special Zone, a 200,000-strong labor army, faces full of joy, have taken up sickles and gone into battle to harvest summer-ripening crops. As of the 18th, more than 30,000 mu of rapeseed, and more than 100,000 mu of barley, peas, broad beans, etc., and more than 20,000 mu of wheat have been harvested.
    Good news of bumper harvests from various places in the Ankang Special Zone indicate that this year's summer fields have achieved an all-round bumper harvest, with harvests better than last year for all types of crops. The Zhangtan Commune in Ankang County has already harvested 1.9 mu of barley with an average yield of over 1,300 jin per mu, breaking the Ankang Special Zone's high-yield record for barley. The Zhouyun Production Team of the Puxi Commune in Shiquan County has already harvested 99 mu of wheat with an average yield of 422 jin per mu, more than double last year's yield.
    In order to ensure a high yield and bumper harvest, leading cadres at all levels in the Ankang Special Zone have gone to the front lines of the summer harvest, working in the fields and laboring with the masses. Due to the in-depth and specific leadership of leading cadres at all levels at the forefront, this year's summer harvest has been quick, meticulous, and good from the very beginning.
    The Jinlian and other eight production teams of the Tongguan Commune in eastern Shaanxi Province, where summer field harvesting is earlier, began to harvest wheat with sickles on the 20th and 21st. In the past two days, more than 500 laborers have been mobilized, harvesting 417 mu of wheat, which has already been brought to the threshing ground.
    Lanzhou Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 25th – The summer harvest prelude in the winter wheat producing areas along the Bailong River in Gansu has already begun. Starting from May 20th, tens of thousands of farmers in Wen County, located on both sides of the Bailong River and Baishui River, joyfully began the harvest with sickles.
    This year, the winter wheat in Wen County generally has long ears and full grains, growing generally better than last year. In the harvesting, reports of large-scale bumper harvests are frequently received. The two mu of wheat demonstration field cultivated by the county committee in the Si Jiqing Production Team of the Chengguan Commune, after actual measurement, had an average yield of up to 568 jin per mu. The Jia Chang Production Team of the same commune has 8.9 mu of wheat, which, after being dried, winnowed, and weighed, had an average yield of 240 jin per mu, an increase of 20% compared to 1959, including 1.3 mu with an average yield of 428 jin per mu.
    In order to be prepared to fight the first battle for a bumper harvest this year, the Wen County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party made reasonable arrangements and preparations for the county's summer harvest work as early as the end of April. (Attached picture)

    麦浪翻滚　金光闪闪　到处一片丰收大好景象
    山东贵州陕西甘肃夏收战斗开始了
    广大社员喜笑颜开挥镰上阵力争颗粒归仓丰产丰收
    本报济南25日电　我国主要产麦区之一的山东省，已经揭开夏季大丰收的序幕。早熟地区的鲁中南沂蒙山区、鲁西南大平原和济南市等地区的个别社、队已经开镰收割。
    今年，山东省虽然旱情十分严重，小麦却生长良好。英雄的山东人民，在中共山东省委领导下，从去年秋季开始，就展开了轰轰烈烈的抗旱种麦和抗旱保麦大战，开挖地下水，广开水源，合理利用地上水，战胜旱魔。播种面积比去年增加了一千多万亩，小麦大面积丰产方发展到三千多万亩。不论黄河位山灌区的鲁西大平原，或者是丘陵起伏的胶东半岛，也不论是山石峥嵘的鲁中南沂蒙山区，或者是渤海之滨新开垦的碱荒地，到处麦浪滚滚，金黄一片，呈现一片丰收景象。
    为了夺得小麦大丰收的最后一关，根据今年小麦种植面积大、麦穗好的特点，中共山东省委第一书记舒同同志和书记处书记裴孟飞同志亲自挂帅，全省各地、县和人民公社三级党委，普遍成立了指挥部，决定拿出80％以上的劳动力投入战斗。工业和商业部门准备的脱粒机具、快速收割机和镰刀、小车，正源源运到各人民公社使用。
    新华社贵阳25日电　贵州省到15日止已抢收小麦、油菜和杂粮作物六百零八万多亩，比去年同期多五倍左右。
    今年贵州省夏收面积成倍扩大，作物成熟一致，加上春播任务重，劳力比较紧张。但是，各地充分发挥人民公社一大二公的优越性，根据等价交换原则，以生产队为单位广泛组织大协作，采取流水作业方法，使收割、脱粒、晒、运、入仓等各个环节紧密衔接，从而使夏收进行得又快又好。
    许多地区的机关、学校、部队组织抢收队，协助人民公社突击收割。
    本报讯　据陕西日报消息：陕西省今年第一个丰收的战斗开始了。安康专区二十万劳动大军，喜笑颜开，挥镰上阵，收割夏熟作物。截至18日已收割油菜三万多亩，大麦、豌豆、胡豆等十多万亩，小麦二万多亩。
    安康专区各地传来的丰收喜讯表明：今年的夏田全面大丰收，不论哪种作物的收成都比去年好。安康县张滩公社已收打的一亩九分大麦平均亩产一千三百多斤，打破了安康专区大麦高产纪录。石泉县蒲溪公社酎云生产队，已收打的九十九亩小麦，平均亩产四百二十二斤，比去年翻了一番还多。
    为了确保丰产丰收，安康专区各级领导干部，已纷纷走上夏收第一线，在田间办公，同群众一起劳动。由于各级领导干部深入第一线加强具体领导，今年夏收一开始就收得快，收得细，收得好。
    陕西省东部夏田收获较早的潼关公社金联等八个生产队，已于20、21日开始搭镰收割小麦，两天来，共出劳动力五百多名，收回小麦四百一十七亩，已经登场。
    本报兰州25日电　甘肃白龙江畔冬麦产区的夏收序幕已经揭开。从5月20日开始，位居白龙江、白水江两岸的文县数万农民，喜气洋洋，首先开镰收割。
    今年，文县冬小麦普遍穗长粒饱，长得普遍比去年好。在收打中，大面积丰产捷报频传。县委在城关公社四季青生产队培育的二亩小麦指挥田，经实打实测，平均每亩产量高达五百六十八斤。该社贾昌生产队有八亩九分小麦，经过晒干扬净过秤，平均亩产二百四十斤，比1959年增产二成，其中有一点三亩，平均亩产四百二十八斤。
    中共文县县委为了有准备地打好今年第一个丰收仗，早在4月底就对全县夏收工作作了合理部署和准备工作。（附图片）
