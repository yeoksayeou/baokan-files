(Our Correspondent Han Guoying reports) A comprehensive collaboration has been organized among factories, schools, and scientific research institutions in Shaanxi Province. Following the on-site conference on comprehensive collaboration among factories, schools, and scientific research institutions recently convened by the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, a wave of collaboration immediately swept across the province. In just three or four days, sixteen schools and scientific research institutions, including Xi'an Jiaotong University, Shaanxi Provincial Mechanical Manufacturing School, and the Applied Acoustics and Optics Research Institute of the Shaanxi Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, established new comprehensive collaborative relationships with seventy-five factories; thousands of factories, schools, and scientific research institutions have submitted requests for collaboration.

Currently, the scale of comprehensive collaboration in Shaanxi Province is growing, and the scope of collaboration is expanding. Not only has the principle of "one main, two auxiliary, and three combinations" been implemented within individual units, but mutual collaboration has also been implemented between factories, schools, and scientific research institutions. These three entities are not merely collaborating in one aspect but are engaging in comprehensive collaboration in the three areas of production, education, and scientific research. Xi'an Jiaotong University dispatched 2,700 faculty and students to assist 60 factories in the Shaanxi region in carrying out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, establishing comprehensive collaborative relationships with 48 factories and jointly tackling more than 100 key technical problems; the factories supplied various materials and equipment to Jiaotong University. The university also accepts workers for further study (either at the university or in training classes run in factories), and the factories also send people to teach students. In the collaboration, the communist style of giving convenience to others and keeping difficulties for oneself has become a social norm. In order to assist the Shaanxi Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in its scientific research, Northwest University accepted the request of the Science Branch to attach nine research institutes (or laboratories) to the university and lent a large number of houses, equipment, and materials to the institutes. They also conducted many research projects together with these institutes.

Collaboration has greatly promoted the mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation technical innovation and technical revolution movement. According to Xi'an City statistics alone, by the end of March, more than 600 automatic production lines and interconnected lines and more than 1,600 automated single machines had appeared, saving nearly 10,000 laborers. Now, the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization has been greatly improved. The state-owned machinery industry has basically realized mechanization and semi-mechanization in forging, casting, fitting, and in-factory transportation. Many of these innovation achievements are the result of comprehensive collaboration.

Comprehensive collaboration has powerfully promoted the in-depth development of the education revolution. Many schools have integrated their teaching tasks with the production tasks of factories, aligning their teaching plans with the production plans of the factories. Some schools have revised their teaching materials and actively sought to shorten class hours in order to train qualified construction personnel in the shortest possible time. After Northwest Polytechnic University comprehensively collaborated with factories such as Xi'an Instrument Factory and Xi'an Machine Manufacturing Factory, it discovered that some professional courses lacked the latest production technology content, and teachers promptly provided supplementary lessons to students. Since the Economics Department of Northwest University began comprehensively collaborating with the Xi'an Agricultural Machinery Factory, it has essentially rewritten the teaching materials once. Workers directly participated in the writing of the bulk of fifteen sets of teaching materials which were compiled in the factory.

Comprehensive collaboration has also enabled the scientific research cause in the Shaanxi region to experience a high-speed development. Xi'an Metallurgical Institute recently proposed more than 60 major research projects in areas such as smelting and steel, which were the result of summarizing and then improving upon the experiences of workers in collaboration.

Grasping new things and providing support, cultivation, and promotion is the primary experience of Shaanxi Province in carrying out comprehensive collaboration. In the movement for comprehensive collaboration, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China seized the typical example of comprehensive collaboration between Xi'an Jiaotong University and various factories, organized other units to visit and study, and held on-site conferences to summarize and promote it. In this way, comprehensive collaboration rapidly blossomed throughout the province. Secondly, the collaboration methods are flexible and diverse, including long-term collaboration and short-term collaboration, blitz collaboration and regular collaboration, collaboration between factories, schools, and institutes, and collaboration between departments, sections, offices, teams, groups, and workshops. Through these methods, the positive factors of all parties have been mobilized, achieving mutual initiative, mutual care, learning from each other's strengths, and common leaps forward. In order to ensure that both parties complete the collaborative tasks on time, various places have also universally adopted the method of signing contracts to be jointly observed and implemented. Third, under the leadership of the party organizations in their respective departments, a "six-combination" of leading cadres, workers, technicians, teachers, students, and researchers is implemented. Practice has proven that this organization promotes the high-speed development of production, education, and scientific research.

    陕西省组织工厂、学校、科学机关全面大协作
    生产、教育、科学研究高速度发展
    本报讯　记者韩国英报道：陕西省各工厂、学校、科学研究机关组织全面大协作。中共陕西省委最近召开工厂、学校、科学研究机关全面协作现场会议以后，协作的热潮立即风靡全省，三、四天时间，就有西安交通大学、陕西省机械制造学校、中国科学院陕西分院应用声学光学研究所等十六个学校、科学研究机关，和七十五个工厂建立了新的全面协作关系；提出要求协作的工厂、学校、科学研究机关数以千计。
    目前，陕西省全面协作的规模越来越大，协作的方面越来越广，不仅一个单位内部实行了“一主二辅三结合”，而且工厂、学校、科学研究机关之间也实行了相互协作。这三个单位不只是在一个方面实行协作，而是在生产、教育、科学研究三个方面实行了全面协作。西安交通大学抽调二千七百名师生，协助陕西地区六十个工厂开展技术革新和技术革命运动，同四十八个工厂建立了全面协作关系，和这些工厂一起攻下了一百多个技术关键；各工厂向交通大学供应了各种材料和设备。这个学校还接受工人到学校进修（或在工厂办训练班），工厂也派人给学生上课。在协作中，把方便让给别人、把困难留给自己的共产主义风格，已经蔚为社会风尚。西北大学为了协助中国科学院陕西分院搞好科学研究，接受了科学分院的要求，把九个研究所（室）附设在学校里，并把大批的房屋、设备、资料借给研究所。他们还同这些研究所一起进行了许多项目的研究。
    通过协作大大推动了机械化半机械化、自动化半自动化的技术革新和技术革命运动。仅据西安市统计，到3月底，已出现生产自动线、联动线六百多条，自动化单机一千六百多台，节约劳力将近一万个。现在，机械化、半机械化程度已提高很多。国营机械工业基本上实现了锻工、铸工、钳工、厂内运输机械化和半机械化。这些革新成果很多都是全面协作的产物。
    全面协作有力地促进了教育革命深入发展。许多学校已把教学任务与工厂的生产任务结合在一起，使教学计划与工厂的生产计划对上了口径。有的学校重新修改了教材，积极设法缩短学时，争取在最短时间内培养出合格的建设人材。西北工业大学与西安仪表厂、西安机器制造厂等工厂全面协作后，发现有些专业课程缺少最新的生产技术部分，教师就及时给学生补课。西北大学经济系与西安农械厂全面协作以来，已经把教材基本上重新编了一次，有十五门教材大部分是在工厂编的，工人们直接参加了这些教材的编写工作。
    全面协作也使陕西地区的科学研究事业出现了一个高速度发展的局面。西安冶金学院最近在冶炼、钢铁等方面提出了六十多个重大的研究项目，就是在协作中，总结了工人的经验，然后加以提高的结果。
    抓住新生事物加以扶植、培养和推广，这是陕西省开展全面协作的首要的经验。在全面协作的运动中，中共陕西省委抓住西安交通大学同各工厂全面协作的典型事例，组织其他单位参观、学习，并且召开现场会议进行总结和推广。这样，就使全面协作迅速在全省遍地开花。其次，协作方式灵活多样，有长期协作，也有短期协作；有突击性协作，也有经常性协作；有厂、校、所之间协作，也有系、科、室同班、组、车间之间协作。通过这些方式，把各方面的积极因素都调动起来，做到了双方主动、互相照顾、取长补短、共同跃进。为了使协作双方按时完成协作任务，各地还普遍采取了签订合同的办法，共同遵照执行。第三，在所在部门党组织的领导下，实行领导干部、工人、技术员、教师、学生、研究人员六结合。实践证明：这种组织促进了生产、教育、科学研究高速度发展。
