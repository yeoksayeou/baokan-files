Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 14th: People throughout the Soviet Union continue to hold mass rallies, denouncing the provocative activities of American aircraft invading Soviet airspace and the shameless remarks of American officials attempting to justify this banditry.

　　In the Moscow region, more than six hundred mass rallies have been held in recent days, with the participation of 250,000 people. At a mass rally at the "Maslovo" state farm in the Zaraisky district, worker Ulyanov said angrily:
　　"It is outrageous that U.S. President Eisenhower is trying so hard to defend American espionage. We respected him when he told Khrushchev that he would devote himself to the cause of peace. But now we understand that these were just empty words. How can President Eisenhower have the face to meet our people when he visits the Soviet Union?"
　　At a staff meeting at the "Dinamo" factory in Moscow, engineer Yablonsky, director of the third machine workshop, said that U.S. Secretary of State Herter had issued a brazen statement with the approval of the U.S. President, saying that the U.S. government considers such espionage by American aircraft to be normal and that it intends to continue such activities in the future. All Soviet people are outraged by this statement. We Soviet people denounce the provocateurs and the champions of the "Cold War." Assistant technician Tereknin of the "Three Mountains" textile factory in Moscow said at a staff meeting that the warmongers should know that any provocateur on our territory will suffer the same fate as the American aerial spy. The Soviet people are peace-loving, but they will inflict a devastating blow on anyone who dares to invade their sacred territory.
　　At a mass rally at the Kuibyshev Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant in Siberia, Scherbin, secretary of the Irkutsk Regional Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, said that the basic arguments of Herter's statement had been confirmed by Eisenhower himself at a press conference. This statement shows that these spy flights by American aircraft were not only directed by the U.S. government, but also constitute the essence of U.S. policy. This espionage shows that their hypocritical assurances of peace are false.
　　Thirty specialized colleges and scientific research institutions in Lviv held mass protest rallies.
　　One hundred thousand people held a protest rally in Stalingrad. The resolution adopted at the meeting said that we denounce the attempt by the United States to re-escalate international tensions and disrupt the summit meeting. We fully endorse the resolute actions taken by our government to eliminate the American aerial bandits, and our armed forces will continue to give the aggressors a fatal rebuff in the future.

    痛斥美国挑衅和无赖
    苏联各地人民继续集会
    据新华社莫斯科14日电　苏联各地人民继续举行群众集会，痛斥美国飞机侵犯苏联领空的挑衅活动以及美国官方人士力图为这一强盗行径辩解的无耻言论。
    莫斯科州近几天来举行了六百次以上的群众集会，参加这些集会的人达二十五万之多。在扎拉伊斯基区“马斯洛沃”国营农场的群众大会上，工人乌里扬诺夫愤慨地说：
  “美国总统艾森豪威尔极力为美国间谍行为辩护，真令人气愤。当他向赫鲁晓夫说，他将致力于和平事业的时候，我们尊敬过他。但是现在我们明白了，这不过是花言巧语。艾森豪威尔总统来苏联访问时，他怎么有脸见我们的人？”
    在莫斯科市“狄纳莫”工厂的职工大会上，第三机器车间主任雅勃隆斯基工程师说，美国国务卿赫脱发表了经美国总统同意的厚颜无耻的声明，他竟说美国政府认为美国飞机的这种间谍行为是正常现象，而且表示今后还要继续这种行为。全体苏联人听到这种言论都非常气愤。我们苏联人痛斥挑衅者、痛斥“冷战”卫士。莫斯科“三山”纺织工厂助理技师捷列克宁在职工大会上说，战争贩子应该知道，任何挑衅者在我们的领土上都将遭到和美国空中间谍同样的命运。苏联人民是爱好和平的，然而他们对胆敢侵犯他们神圣领土的人将给予毁灭性的打击。
    在西伯利亚的古比雪夫重型机器制造厂的群众大会上，苏共伊尔库次克州委书记舍尔宾说，赫脱的声明的基本论点已由艾森豪威尔本人在记者招待会上加以证实了。这个声明表明，美国飞机的这种间谍飞行不仅是美国政府指使的，而且构成了美国政策的实质。这种间谍活动表明了他们那种假仁假义的和平保证是虚伪的。
    利沃夫有三十个专门学院和科学研究机关举行了群众抗议大会。
    斯大林格勒十万人举行了抗议集会。大会所通过的决议中说，我们痛斥美国想重新加剧国际紧张局势和破坏最高级会议的企图。我们完全赞同我国政府所采取的消灭美国空中强盗的果断行动，我们的武装力量今后仍将给予侵略者以致命的回击。
