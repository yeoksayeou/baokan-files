Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 30th. Approximately eighty representatives from the Japanese "Osaka Prefecture Joint Struggle Conference to Prevent Revision of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty" went to the Osaka office of the U.S. Consul in Kobe today to protest the conclusion of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and oppose Eisenhower's visit to Japan.

　　They also demanded that the United States immediately withdraw U-2 aircraft from Japan, and demanded that U.S. Ambassador MacArthur II retract his statement slandering Socialist Party Chairman Inejiro Asanuma and the Socialist Party. The representatives were unable to meet with any officials from the consulate, as they all hid upon hearing the news of the representatives' arrival. However, the representatives stated that they would go to the office again until they met with a responsible official.

    大阪府代表到美国领事馆办事处示威
    新华社30日讯　东京消息：日本“阻止修改日美安全条约大阪府共同斗争会议”的大约八十名代表今天到美国驻神户领事的大阪办事处去，抗议缔结新日美“安全条约”和反对艾森豪威尔访问日本。
    他们还要求美国立刻从日本撤走U—2型飞机，要求美国大使麦克阿瑟第二收回诬蔑社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎和社会党的声明。代表们未能见到领事馆的任何官员，因为他们听见代表要来的消息都躲起来了。但是代表们表示将再次到办事处去，直到见到负责官员为止。
