    Urban People's Commune Members Celebrate the Holiday
    Harbin's Xiangfang Commune Rally and Parade by More Than 70,000 People
    Zhengzhou Red Flag Commune Celebrates May Day with Excellent Production Achievements
    (Our newspaper, Harbin, 1st dispatch) Today, the male and female members of the Xiangfang Urban People's Commune in Harbin happily celebrated International Labor Day on May 1st. Feng Jixin, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Li Rui, Standing Committee Member and Minister of the Organization Department of the Provincial Committee, Zhang Ruilin, Standing Committee Member and Minister of the United Front Work Department of the Provincial Committee, Zhang Shude, Secretary of the Harbin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Wang Huacheng, Standing Committee Member of the Municipal Committee and Deputy Mayor of Harbin, joined them in celebrating this national holiday.
    On the morning of May 1st, the streets and alleys of the Xiangfang People's Commune were exceptionally beautiful, decorated with palace lanterns and posters with slogans celebrating International Labor Day. Young girls in brightly colored costumes and workers beating gongs and drums enthusiastically walked towards the square next to the commune. Today, the Xiangfang People's Commune celebrated in separate districts, with more than 70,000 people participating in the rally. Except for the elderly and children, most of the commune members participated.
    In this year's parade, the teams of urban residents were no longer visible, because with the establishment of the commune, they have gone to the industrial and service fronts. Workers carrying signs of completed production plans and models of various new products marched forward in a mighty procession. Xiangfang, a rising industrial area, originally had only three state-owned factories and eighteen local state-owned factories, in addition to a few blacksmith shops, tailor shops, and handicraft cooperatives making tin products. Since the establishment of the urban commune centered on the Harbin Bearing Factory, a large state-owned factory, commune-run industries have sprung up like mushrooms after a rain, and now there are 350 small factories. The total industrial output value of the entire commune in the first four months of this year is equivalent to the whole year of 1958, and is 1.3 times higher than the same period in 1959. The most eye-catching team in this worker contingent was the commune's electrical appliance factory team. This electrical appliance factory, which was organized by two watchmakers and one engraver, has now grown to more than 500 people, with 16 kinds of products, selling far and wide to 17 provinces and cities across the country. The factory's red banner bearer, Liu Guiyuan, used to participate in parades as a street woman, but today she is celebrating her holiday as a member of the working class.
    In the cultural and educational contingent, the Young Pioneers held bouquets and shouted slogans. The middle school and university teams carried charts showing the great leap forward on the cultural and educational front. Before communization, there were only 15 middle and primary schools here. Now, the number of middle and primary schools has increased to 46, and a complete educational system and cultural and educational network from kindergarten, primary school, middle school to university is being formed here.
    The farmers' team driving tractors held up signs showing vegetable production, telling people that the Heping management area of this commune alone supplied the commune with 250,000 jin of vegetables before the holiday, an increase of seven times compared with the same day last year.
    The literary and artistic army at the rear of the parade performed dragon dances, lion dances, donkey rides and other programs, which were warmly praised by the people.
    This year's International Labor Day on May 1st was a colorful one for the members of the Xiangfang People's Commune. Before the festival, the service personnel of the living service station bought back rich festival materials. The nine staple and non-staple food processing stations and 356 public canteens have prepared rich festive meals and pastries for the members.

    (Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 1st dispatch) The employees of the Zhengzhou Red Flag People's Commune, who were housewives more than a year ago, are celebrating International Labor Day today with outstanding production achievements.
    This morning, members of the Red Flag People's Commune carried charts of production achievements and models of various new products to the square. Thousands of female employees showed a proud expression, indicating that they are members of the great socialist construction ranks. Model cook Du Xiuzhen excitedly told reporters that she joined the Communist Party on the eve of May Day, along with six other female employees. This housewife with three children has grown into an outstanding member of the working class vanguard in the soil of the urban people's commune.
    The members of the Red Flag People's Commune carried a chart of exceeding the production plan by 230% in April, presenting it as a gift to their holiday. In April, under the slogan of "One Gift per Person for May Day," all members launched a climax of technical innovation and technical revolution, put forward thousands of rationalization proposals in a few days, and realized hundreds of innovation projects, which increased production efficiency by four to five hundred times. The employees of the Red Flag Commune Motor Factory made a 10-kilowatt mechanical distillation generator on the eve of May Day and sent it to Beijing. A women's stamping group in this factory made a stamping machine last night, which solved the key production problem of the whole factory. When dawn was approaching, they took off their work clothes and put on festive costumes, and happily participated in the celebration activities. Jin Lanying, a female employee with three children in the yarn wrapping workshop of this factory, successfully trial-produced a "one-machine multi-knife reeling machine" before May Day, saving six full labor forces in two shifts a day and increasing work efficiency by 40 times. Today, she was invited to sit on the viewing platform. She told reporters: "Now, I am completely liberated." The May Day gift-giving campaign has raised the production level of the entire Red Flag Commune to a new stage.

    城市人民公社社员欢度佳节
    哈尔滨香坊公社七万多人集会游行
    郑州红旗公社以优异生产成绩庆五一
    本报哈尔滨1日电　今天哈尔滨市香坊城市人民公社的男女社员欢欢乐乐地度过了“五一”国际劳动节。中共黑龙江省委书记处书记冯纪新，省委常委、组织部长李瑞，省委常委、统战部长张瑞麟，中共哈尔滨市委书记张树德，市委常委、哈尔滨副市长王化成和他们一起欢度这个全民的节日。
    5月1日清晨，香坊人民公社的大街小巷，打扮得分外美丽，到处挂着宫灯，张贴着庆祝“五一”国际劳动节的标语口号。穿着鲜艳盛装的年青姑娘们，敲打着锣鼓的工人们，热热闹闹地向公社旁边的广场走去。今天，香坊人民公社分区庆祝，参加集会的人数达七万多人，除老人、小孩外，全公社大部分社员都参加了。
    今年的游行队伍中，已经看不到市民的队伍了，他们随着公社的成立，走上了工业战线和服务战线。工人们扛着完成生产计划的标语牌，拿着各种新产品的模型，浩浩荡荡地走过来了。香坊这个新兴工业区原来除三个国营工厂和十八个地方国营工厂外，只有几家铁匠炉、成衣铺和作洋铁活的手工业合作社，自从成立了以国营大厂哈尔滨轴承厂为中心的城市公社后，社办工业像雨后春笋一样地发展起来，现在已有三百五十个小工厂。今年全社头四个月的工业总产值相当于1958年全年，比1959年同期还提高一点三倍。在这个工人队伍中，最惹人注目的是公社电器厂的队伍，这个由两个钟表匠和一个刻字匠组织起来的电器厂，现在已发展到五百多人，产品已达十六种，远销全国十七个省市。站在队伍前面的厂红旗手刘桂元在过去是作为街道妇女参加游行，而今天她已作为工人阶级来庆祝自己的节日了。
    文教队伍中，少先队员们拿着花束，高呼着口号，中学、大学的队伍，打着文教战线大跃进的图表。公社化前这里只有十五所中、小学校，现在，中、小学校已发展到四十六所，而且这里正形成了从幼儿园、小学、中学到大学一整套完整的教育体系和文化教育网。
    开着拖拉机的农民队伍，高举着蔬菜产量的标语牌，上面告诉人们，仅这个公社的和平管理区在节日前夕，就供应公社二十五万斤蔬菜，比去年这一天增加了七倍。
    走在队伍后面的文艺大军，表演了龙灯舞、狮子舞，跑驴等各种节目，受到了人们的热烈赞扬。
    今年的“五一”国际劳动节，香坊人民公社的社员们，过得丰富多彩。在节日前夕，生活服务站的服务员们，就把丰富的节日物资买了回来。九处主副食品加工站和三百五十六处公共食堂，已为社员们准备了丰富的节日盛餐和糕点。

    据新华社郑州1日电　一年多以前还是家庭妇女的郑州市红旗人民公社的职工，今天以优异的生产成绩，庆祝“五一”国际劳动节。
    今日早晨红旗人民公社的社员们抬着生产成绩图表和各种新产品的模型朝广场进发。几千名女职工显出自豪的神情，说明她们是伟大的社会主义建设行列中的成员。模范炊事员杜秀珍兴奋地告诉记者，她在五一节前夕加入了共产党，和她一起批准入党的还有六名女职工。这位有着三个孩子的家庭妇女，在城市人民公社的土壤里，成长为优秀的工人阶级先锋队的一分子。
    红旗人民公社的社员们抬着4月份超额230％完成生产计划的图表，向自己的节日献礼。4月份全体社员在“一人一礼献五一”的口号下，掀起了技术革新和技术革命高潮，几天内提出了几千条合理化建议，并且实现了几百条革新项目，使生产效率提高四倍到五百倍。红旗公社电机厂的职工们，在五一节前夕制成了十瓩机械蒸馏发电机，送到北京。这个厂有一个妇女冲压小组，昨夜制成了冲压器，解决了全厂的关键性生产问题，天快亮时，她们脱下工作服换上节日的盛装，欢天喜地参加了庆祝活动。这个厂的包纱线车间有三个孩子的女职工金兰英，五一前夕试制成功“一机多拥刀丝机，一天两班节约六个整劳力，工效提高四十倍。今天她被邀请坐在观礼台上。她告诉记者：“现在，我才算彻底解放了”。“五一”节的献礼运动，使整个红旗公社生产水平，提高到一个新的阶段。
