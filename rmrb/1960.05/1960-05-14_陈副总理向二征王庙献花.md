Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 13th: Accompanied by Vietnamese Ambassador to China, Trần Tử Bình, and Chairman of the Hanoi Municipal Administrative Committee, Trần Duy Hưng, Vice Premier Chen Yi and Vice Minister Zhang Hanfu laid a wreath at the Temple of the Trung Sisters in Hanoi this morning.

　　The Temple of the Trung Sisters is dedicated to the two Vietnamese female national heroes, Trưng Trắc and Trưng Nhị. These two queens, who once unified Vietnam, heroically sacrificed themselves more than 1,900 years ago while fighting against the invading army of Ma Yuan of the Han Dynasty.

　　After laying the wreath, Vice Premier Chen Yi said to the female abbot of the temple: "We are here to pay our respects to the two heroines." He added: "The heroic deeds of the two heroines are worthy of respect by the Vietnamese people and also worthy of respect by the Chinese people. In resisting foreign aggression, the Vietnamese and Chinese people are united."
