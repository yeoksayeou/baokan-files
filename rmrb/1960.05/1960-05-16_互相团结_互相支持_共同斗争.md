    In the past week, a tremendous storm has swept across China. Over 12 million people in 33 cities including Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, Jinan, Nanchang, Xi'an, Changchun, Lüda, Chengdu, Yinchuan, Lhasa, Chongqing, Taiyuan, Fushun, Hangzhou, Nanning, Xining, Wuhan, Nanjing, Lanzhou, Kunming, Guangzhou, Harbin, Hohhot, Urumqi, Shanghai, Zhengzhou, Changsha, Hefei, Qingdao, Fuzhou, Guiyang, Xiamen, and 8 county towns in Shanxi Province, have successively held grand rallies and demonstrations to support the patriotic and just struggle of the Japanese people against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. From the capital to the frontier, across our vast and expansive land, the shouts of "Resolutely oppose the revival of Japanese militarism!" and "People of China and Japan unite, overthrow U.S. imperialism!" reverberated. This is not just the roar of over 12 million people, but the roar of all 650 million Chinese people! The roar of the Chinese people, echoing across the sea with the roar of millions of Japanese people in their 16th unified action against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, is like rolling spring thunder and surging spring tide.

    The war of aggression against China by Japanese imperialism caused countless Chinese families to be torn apart and destroyed! Today, the Chinese people, engaged in socialist construction on their liberated land, are unwilling to bring up this painful history again, but they have certainly not forgotten this blood debt! When they learned that the Japanese reactionaries had once again colluded with U.S. imperialism to conclude a military alliance treaty, pointing the spear of aggression at China once more, how could they suppress the anger in their hearts, how could they endure new hatred on top of old grievances! Just looking at the tens of thousands of people who turned out en masse in dozens of cities to participate in rallies, demonstrations, and marches, one can see how deep the Chinese people's hatred for U.S. and Japanese imperialism is, how great their anger is at their new schemes of aggression, and how firm their will is to oppose the revival of Japanese militarism and overthrow U.S. imperialism!

    Listen to the angry voices of the Chinese people who suffered the disasters of Japanese imperialist aggression! Qi Wenzhou, a farmer from Lugouqiao, a witness to the "July 7th" Incident, whose leg was blown off by a Japanese shell, wrote on his banner: "U.S. and Japanese imperialism, I tell you, the Chinese people have stood up today. If you dare to bully us again, we will smash your dog heads and chop off your devil claws!" Liu Lianren, a compatriot who was abducted to Japan by Japanese imperialism and lived a subhuman life there for thirteen years, said: "I will never forget the disasters that Japanese imperialism inflicted on the Chinese people! The Kishi Nobusuke government is colluding with U.S. imperialism and wants to take the old road of aggression against China. This is impossible!" Lu Renfu, who lost his mother and younger sister in the brutal seven-day and seven-night bombing of Chongqing by the Japanese fascists in 1939, said: "She hates Japanese militarists to death and will never allow the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries to trample on people who are living a happy life like her!" Cui Shengfu, who survived the Nanjing Massacre by Japanese invading forces in 1937, an event that shocked the world, after being hit by two bullets, said: "We Nanjing people will never forget the blood debt owed by the Japanese aggressors, and we must never let U.S. imperialism rearm Japan."... This is the angry roar of the Chinese people, this is the bloody tearful accusation of the Chinese people.

    The Chinese people do not have any "misunderstanding" of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, as Kishi Nobusuke falsely claims, but deeply understand its aggressive nature. According to this treaty, Japan will continue to expand its militarist forces, continue to provide military bases to the United States, and will conspire with U.S. imperialism to plan new wars of aggression. The Kishi Nobusuke clique has made no secret of saying that the scope of the treaty includes "areas around Japan such as the area north of the Philippines, the coastal areas of China, and the (Soviet) Maritime Provinces"; according to the treaty, U.S. forces can be dispatched to "the interior of China or the Soviet Union." Kishi Nobusuke, who was overwhelmed by the signing of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, recently even clamored that if the Chinese people want to liberate Taiwan, Japan "cannot remain indifferent!" The Chinese people have seen that, with the active support of U.S. imperialism, the Japanese militarists, who are being revived, want to impose new war disasters on the Chinese people! However, the liberated 650 million Chinese people are not afraid of any provocations by U.S. and Japanese imperialism. The current China is no longer the old China ruled by the traitorous government of non-resistance when Japanese imperialism launched the "September 18th" Incident in 1931; it is no longer the weak and disorganized old China when Japanese imperialism launched a full-scale war of aggression against China in 1937; nor is it the China shortly after the birth of the new China in 1950 when the United States launched the war of aggression against Korea, when everything was waiting to be done and it was too late to build its own modern national defense. Since the Chinese people were able to fight bloody battles for eight years in extremely difficult circumstances before liberation and defeat Japanese imperialism; since they were able to fight alongside the Korean people in difficult conditions in the early days of liberation and defeat U.S. imperialism's aggression against Korea and provocations against China; then, the Chinese people today, ten years after liberation, have full confidence and strength to smash any provocations by U.S. and Japanese imperialism against China! The great demonstrations of over 12 million people in major Chinese cities in support of the patriotic and just struggle of the Japanese people fully demonstrate the firm will and invincible strength of the Chinese people. Anyone who does not open their eyes to see the liberated great China and the Chinese people, anyone who wants to impose a new war on the Chinese people, will surely be smashed to pieces!

    The Japanese people, starting from May 9th, have begun their 16th unified action, pushing the struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty to a new high tide. The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan has decided to mobilize 20 million people to petition the Diet in this unified action; on May 12th, 4.6 million workers across Japan held a general strike; on May 14th, 100,000 people in Tokyo formed a massive procession to petition the Diet; in recent days, the Japanese people have gathered in meetings and demonstrations and gone to Tokyo to petition the Diet; at the same time, the number of people who have signed petitions against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty throughout Japan has reached 13.5 million. Currently, the Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty is rising wave after wave.

    The people of China and Japan have suffered the deepest from the aggression and oppression of Japanese imperialism and, after the war, of the United States, which replaced Japanese imperialism. Therefore, in their common experience, they have received the most profound education and recognized the common interests of the Chinese and Japanese people. The large-scale demonstrations held by people in various parts of China have strongly supported the just struggle of the Japanese people. Kenji Miyamoto, Secretary-General of the Japanese Communist Party, pointed out that the million-person demonstration in Beijing marks the further strengthening of the Chinese people's support for the Japanese people's struggle. It is also a large-scale demonstration of the Asian people's resolute opposition to the U.S. imperialism and Kishi Nobusuke's establishment of a military alliance. The Japanese people have received great encouragement from this. Hirozo Mizoguchi, the leader of the Japanese "National Council to Stop the Revision of the Security Treaty," said in a statement that with the strong support of Chinese friends, the Japanese people will intensify their struggle against the common enemy of the Japanese and Chinese people—U.S. imperialism and the Kishi Nobusuke clique. The patriotic and just struggle of the Japanese people has also given strong support to the Chinese people. It is extremely natural and extremely necessary for the people of China and Japan to unite and carry out a common struggle. It is an important guarantee for us to win the victory in the just struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, against wars of aggression, and for the defense of peace in Asia and the world.

    The struggle of the people of China and Japan against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty is a struggle to safeguard and consolidate the peace and security of the entire Asia. As everyone knows, during World War II, the war of aggression launched by Japanese imperialism caused unprecedentedly serious disasters in many Asian countries that were invaded. It not only caused the Chinese people to lose more than 10 million lives and at least 50 billion U.S. dollars in property; not only increased Japan's number of orphans by 2 million and widows by 1.83 million, but also caused more than 2 million Indonesian workers to die in labor service, and tens of thousands of soldiers were forced to serve as cannon fodder and thousands of patriots sacrificed in Japanese prisons; caused the Philippines to have more than 1.1 million deaths and losses of more than 5.5 billion U.S. dollars; caused Burma to lose more than 18 billion rupees of wealth; caused more than 2 million Vietnamese people to die of starvation; and caused India's grain imports to be cut off, starving more than 3.5 million people to death. Today, the signing of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, which is a tool for the United States to launch new wars of aggression in the Far East, has once again raised a cloud over the Asian continent and become a serious threat to Asian countries. Therefore, resolutely opposing the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty is a common struggle task of the Asian people.

    Chairman Mao Zedong pointed out on May 14th: "The new U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty' is an aggressive military alliance treaty aimed at oppressing the broad masses of the Japanese people, making enemies of China and the Soviet Union, and making enemies of the Asian people. It is a serious threat to peace in Asia and the world, and it will inevitably bring serious disasters to the Japanese people. The people of China and Japan, the people of Asia, and the peace-loving people of the world should all oppose the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty." Chairman Mao's words express the will of the 650 million Chinese people, and also express the will of the entire Asian people. The Chinese people firmly stand with the Japanese people and with the people of all Asian countries, and wage unremitting struggles against the aggressive U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, and for the peace and security of the entire Asia and the world.

    At present, on the Asian continent, not only have the Japanese people launched a high tide of struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, but the people of South Korea, South Vietnam, and Turkey have also launched struggles against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs. This shows that the storm of the struggle of the people of Asian countries against imperialism and its running dogs will rise even more. More than 12 million people in various parts of China held large-scale demonstrations to support the just struggle of the Japanese people, and Pyongyang, North Korea, also held a large-scale rally of 200,000 people to support the just struggle of the Japanese people; not long ago, people in various parts of China also held rallies and demonstrations to support the patriotic and just struggles of the people of South Korea and Turkey against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs. As Chairman Mao pointed out: "The just struggles of the people of all countries in the world support each other." The people of China and Japan unite, the peace-loving people of Asia and all countries in the world unite, support each other, and fight together. The struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and for the defense of peace in Asia and the world will surely achieve victory.

### 互相团结　互相支持　共同斗争

    互相团结　互相支持　共同斗争
    在过去的一个星期里，全中国兴起了一场巨大的风暴。北京、天津、沈阳、济南、南昌、西安、长春、旅大、成都、银川、拉萨、重庆、太原、抚顺、杭州、南宁、西宁、武汉、南京、兰州、昆明、广州、哈尔滨、呼和浩特、乌鲁木齐、上海、郑州、长沙、合肥、青岛、福州、贵阳、厦门等三十三个城市和山西省的八个县城共一千二百多万人，先后举行了盛大集会和示威游行，支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的爱国正义斗争。从首都到边疆，在我国辽阔广袤的土地上，响彻了“坚决反对日本军国主义复活！”“中日两国人民团结起来，打倒美帝国主义！”的吼声。这不只是一千二百多万人的吼声，而是六亿五千万全体中国人民的吼声！中国人民的吼声，同日本千百万人民反对日美军事同盟条约第十六次统一行动的吼声，隔着大海，遥相呼应，有如春雷滚动，春潮澎湃。
    日本帝国主义侵略中国的战争，曾使中国多少人妻离子散，家破人亡！今天，在解放了的国土上从事社会主义建设的中国人民，本来不愿再提起这一段惨痛的历史，可是他们也绝没有忘记这一血海深仇！当他们知道日本反动派又同美帝国主义勾结，缔结军事同盟条约，把侵略的矛头再度指向中国的时候，他们怎能够抑止住心头的怒火，怎能够忍受旧恨上再加新仇！只要看看在以上几十个城市中都是万人空巷地参加集会、示威和游行，就可以知道中国人民对于美日帝国主义的仇恨有多深，对它们的新的侵略阴谋的愤怒是多么大，而反对复活日本军国主义、打倒美帝国主义的意志又是多么坚强！
    请听听惨遭日本帝国主义侵略灾害的中国人民的愤怒呼声吧！“七七”事变的目击者——被日本炮弹炸断了腿的芦沟桥农民祁文周的旗子上写道：“美日帝国主义，我告诉你们，今天中国人民站起来了。如果你们再敢欺侮我们，我们就砸烂你的狗头，斩断你的魔爪！”曾被日本帝国主义劫往日本过了十三年非人生活的难胞刘连仁说：“我永远也忘不了日本帝国主义加给我们中国人民的灾难！岸信介政府勾结美帝国主义，要想走侵略中国的老路，这是办不到的！”曾在1939年日本法西斯在重庆进行的七天七夜残酷大轰炸中失去母亲和妹妹的卢仁福说：“她恨死了日本军国主义分子，决不容许美日反动派再来蹂躏像她一样过着幸福生活的人们！”曾在1937年震动世界的日本侵略军南京大屠杀事件中身中两弹死里逃生的崔省福说：“我们南京人再也忘不了日本侵略者欠下的血债，我们决不能再让美帝国主义把日本重新武装起来。”……这是中国人民愤怒的吼声，这是中国人民血泪的控诉。
    中国人民对于日美军事同盟条约，并不是像岸信介所胡说的有所“误解”，而是深知其侵略的性质。根据这个条约，日本将继续扩充它的军国主义力量，继续向美国提供军事基地，并将同美帝国主义一起，共同策划新的侵略战争。岸信介集团毫不讳言地说，条约适用的范围包括“菲律宾以北、中国的沿海、（苏联）滨海边区等日本周围地区”；根据条约美军可以出动到“中国的内地或苏联”。被日美军事同盟条约的签订冲昏头脑的岸信介最近甚至叫嚷，中国人民如果要解放台湾，日本将“不能无动于衷”！中国人民已经看到，在美帝国主义的积极扶持下，正在复活的日本军国主义者，又想把新的战争灾难加在中国人民的头上！然而，解放了的六亿五千万中国人民，决不害怕美日帝国主义的任何挑衅。现在的中国，已经不再是1931年日本帝国主义发动“九一八”事变那时为不抵抗主义的卖国政府所统治的旧中国了；已经不再是1937年日本帝国主义发动全面侵华战争那时软弱涣散的旧中国了；也已经不是1950年美国发动侵略朝鲜战争那时，新中国诞生不久，百废待举，还来不及建设起自己现代化国防的中国了。中国人民既然能在解放前极端艰苦的环境中，浴血抗战八年，打败日本帝国主义；既然能够在解放初期困难的条件下，同朝鲜人民并肩作战，打垮美帝国主义对朝鲜的侵略和对中国的挑衅；那末，中国人民在解放十年之后的今天、就完全有信心有力量粉碎美日帝国主义对中国的任何挑衅！中国各大城市一千二百多万人支持日本人民爱国正义斗争的大示威，就充分显示了中国人民的坚强意志和不可战胜的力量。谁要是不睁开眼睛看看解放了的伟大中国和中国人民，谁要把新的战争强加在中国人民头上，谁就一定会碰得头破血流！
    日本人民从5月9日起，已经开始了第十六次统一行动，把反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争推向一个新的高潮。日本工会总评议会已决定在这次统一行动中动员两千万人向国会请愿；5月12日，日本全国各地的四百六十万工人举行了大罢工；5月14日，东京十万人组成浩大的队伍向国会请愿；最近几天中，日本人民纷纷集会示威和前往东京向国会请愿；同时，在日本全国各地签名反对日美军事同盟条约的人数已达一千三百五十万人。目前，日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争正在一浪高过一浪。
    中日两国人民是同样受到日本帝国主义以及战后代替了日本帝国主义的美国的侵略和压迫最深的，因而在共同的经历中，受到同样最深刻的教育，认识了中日人民的共同利害关系。中国各地人民举行的大示威有力地支持了日本人民的正义斗争，日本共产党总书记宫本显治指出：北京一百万人大示威标志着中国人民进一步加强对日本人民斗争的支援，它同时是亚洲人民坚决反对美帝国主义和岸信介建立军事同盟的大示威，日本人民从这里得到很大的鼓舞。日本“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”的领导人水口宏三发表谈话说：日本人民在中国朋友的强大支援下，将加紧斗争，反对日本和中国人民的公敌——美帝国主义和岸信介集团。日本人民的爱国正义斗争，也给予了中国人民以有力的支持。中日两国人民团结起来，进行共同的斗争，是极其自然的，极其必要的，是我们为反对日美军事同盟条约，反对侵略战争，保卫亚洲和世界和平这一正义斗争能够取得胜利的重要保证。
    中日两国人民反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争，是维护和巩固整个亚洲的和平和安全的斗争。大家知道，在第二次世界大战期间，日本帝国主义发动的侵略战争，在亚洲许多被侵略的国家造成了空前严重的灾难。它不仅使中国人民损失了一千万以上的生命和最少五百亿美元以上的财产；不仅使日本增加了两百万孤儿和一百八十三万寡妇，而且使印度尼西亚二百万以上的劳动者死于劳役，十几万士兵被迫充当了炮灰和千百志士牺牲于日本的牢狱之中；使菲律宾死亡了一百一十多万人和损失了五十五亿美元以上；使缅甸损失一百八十多亿卢比的财富；使二百多万越南人民因饥饿而死亡；使印度粮食进口断绝，饿死了三百五十多万人。今天，作为美国在远东发动新侵略战争工具的日美军事同盟条约的签订，又在亚洲大地的上空浮起了一片乌云，成为对亚洲国家的严重威胁，因之，坚决反对日美军事同盟条约，已是亚洲人民共同的斗争任务。
    毛泽东主席在5月14日指出：“新的日美‘安全条约’是为了压迫日本广大人民，是以中苏为敌、以亚洲人民为敌的侵略性的军事同盟条约，它对亚洲和世界和平是严重的威胁，同时也必将把严重的灾难带来给日本人民。中日两国人民和亚洲人民以及全世界爱好和平的人民都应当反对日美军事同盟条约。”毛主席的话表达了中国六亿五千万人民的意志，也表达了整个亚洲人民的意志。中国人民坚决同日本人民站在一起，同亚洲各国人民站在一起，为反对侵略性的日美军事同盟条约，为争取整个亚洲和全世界的和平和安全而进行不懈的斗争。
    目前，在亚洲大地上，不仅日本人民掀起了反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争高潮，南朝鲜人民、南越人民和土耳其人民也掀起了反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争，这表明亚洲各国人民反对帝国主义及其走狗的斗争风暴还会有更大的兴起。中国各地一千二百多万人举行大示威，支持日本人民的正义斗争，朝鲜平壤市也举行了二十万人大集会支持日本人民的正义斗争；不久前，中国各地人民还举行了集会示威，支持了南朝鲜人民和土耳其人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的爱国正义斗争。正如毛主席所指出的：“全世界各国人民的正义斗争，都是互相支持的。”中日两国人民团结起来，亚洲和全世界各国爱好和平的人民团结起来，互相支持，共同斗争。反对美日军事同盟条约、保卫亚洲和全世界和平的斗争，一定能够获得胜利。
