Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 12th: The Secretariat of the "National Conference to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty" in Japan today wrote a letter to the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, expressing heartfelt gratitude for the one million Chinese people who held a rally in Beijing on the 9th to support the Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. The National Conference stated that it will resolutely fight the US imperialism and the Kishi Nobusuke government to the end with national unity.

The letter stated that the "National Conference to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty" has launched sixteen unified actions one after another from last year to now in order to prevent the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and the scale of the struggle is expanding unprecedentedly. We are convinced that this struggle will play a major role in striving for Japan's peace and independence, safeguarding democracy, and striving for the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China.

The letter pointed out that our struggle is currently facing the most important juncture, and the opportunity to give a decisive counterattack to the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and the US imperialists has arrived. We will fight to the end with the entire working class as the vanguard and based on national unity.

The letter emphasized that the strong support of the Chinese people has given us endless encouragement and confidence in victory.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 12th: Miyamoto Kenji, General Secretary of the Japanese Communist Party, issued a statement today calling on the Japanese people to establish a national democratic united front, concentrate all their strength, and fight to smash the conspiracy of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries until final victory is achieved.

Miyamoto Kenji pointed out that the one million-strong demonstration in Beijing marks a further strengthening of the Chinese people's support for the Japanese people's struggle. It is also a major demonstration by the Asian people resolutely opposing the establishment of a military alliance between U.S. imperialism and Kishi Nobusuke. The Japanese people have been greatly encouraged by this.

Miyamoto emphasized that in the face of the increasingly high tide of the Japanese people's struggle to smash the U.S.-Japan military alliance, the Japanese Communist Party will expose the essence of the two enemies of the Japanese people—U.S. imperialism and the Kishi Nobusuke government—to the Japanese people.

Tanaka Toshio, Chairman of the National Movement Committee of the Socialist Party, also pointed out that the Chinese people's large-scale demonstration gave the Japanese people infinite encouragement. At the same time, it proves that Asanuma Inejirō, chairman of the Socialist Party, was completely correct when he said in Beijing last spring that U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the Japanese and Chinese people. Tanaka emphasized that, up to now, more than six million Japanese people have submitted petitions to the Diet, which indicates that the Japanese people's struggle to prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty" has been unprecedentedly magnified.

Tanaka stated that the Socialist Party is continuing to work hard to expand the 16th unified action.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 12th: The Japanese Communist Party has decided to hold a large-scale "General Uprising Rally to Support the Struggle of the South Korean People, Prevent the Ratification of the New Security Treaty, Protest Against the U.S.-Japan Governments, and Demand the Dissolution of the Diet" in Tokyo on the 15th.

The Japanese Communist Party's newspaper, "Akahata," published an editorial today calling on all members of the Japanese Communist Party to fight with all their strength to win a victory in the general uprising rally. The editorial first pointed out the great political significance of this conference. It said that the heroic patriotic struggle of the South Korean people has finally overthrown Syngman Rhee and is currently developing towards the higher goals of striving for democracy, demanding the withdrawal of US troops from Korea, and peacefully unifying North and South Korea. The heroic struggle of the South Korean people has given great encouragement to the Japanese people who oppose the new "Security Treaty," further strengthening the Japanese people's confidence in victory. Moreover, this situation has dealt a blow to U.S. imperialism, the Kishi Nobusuke government, and the Liberal Democratic Party.

"Akahata" pointed out that in order to implement its policy of aggression around the world after the war, U.S. imperialism has occupied Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, South Vietnam, and other places, and turned these areas into military bases from which it launches aggression against socialist countries and independent countries in Asia. This is the greatest source of misfortune for the people of Asian countries and the threat to peace in Asia and the world.

"Akahata" emphasized that the struggle of the South Korean people and the struggle of the Japanese people against the new "Security Treaty" are struggles for national independence and democracy, and at the same time, they are common struggles against the common enemy of U.S. imperialism. This struggle has an indivisible close relationship with the struggle of the people of all countries to safeguard peace in Asia and the world.

The editorial pointed out that the struggle to prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty" is currently facing a more important stage. The Japanese people who oppose the new "Security Treaty" are becoming more and more widespread, the struggle is rising higher and higher, and the contradictions within the Liberal Democratic Party are also deepening further.

"Akahata" emphasized that at present, it is necessary to mobilize democratic forces, launch powerful unified actions centered on workers' strike struggles, force the dissolution of the Diet, prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty," and overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet.

"Akahata" called on the Japanese people to unite with the Korean people, strengthen their common struggle, and force US troops to withdraw from South Korea and Japan. "Akahata" pointed out that the just struggle of the Japanese and Korean people has the support of the people and public opinion around the world, and final victory will surely belong to the Japanese and Korean people.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 12th: Leaders from all walks of life in Japan have expressed their gratitude for the large-scale demonstration of one million people held by the Chinese people in Beijing on the 9th to support the just struggle of the Japanese people, and expressed their determination to strengthen the unity between the people of Japan and China and fight against the common enemy of U.S. imperialism and the Kishi Nobusuke reactionaries to the end.

Yasui Iku, director of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, pointed out that this unprecedented large-scale demonstration by the Chinese people, in coordination with the massive struggle currently launched by the Japanese people, dealt a heavy blow to the common enemies of the people of Japan and China: U.S. imperialism and the Kishi Nobusuke reactionaries.

Yasui pointed out that in order to live up to the expectations of the Chinese people, the Japanese people must further unite and fight to the end to break the U.S.-Japan military alliance that threatens peace in Asia.

Ota Kaoru, chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, pointed out that the news of the Chinese people's large-scale demonstration gave Japanese workers great encouragement. Such strong unity and joint struggle between the Japanese and Chinese people will eventually be able to smash the conspiracy of the common enemies of the Japanese and Chinese people: U.S. imperialism and the Kishi Nobusuke group.

Kushida Fuki, chairman of the Japan Federation of Women's Organizations, emphasized that the news of the one million-strong demonstration in Beijing gave us great encouragement. We must further expand the struggle to prevent the ratification of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and smash the U.S.-Japan military alliance.

She said that the Japan Federation of Women's Organizations will participate in the large-scale unified action on the 14th with all its strength, and is currently working hard for this.

Nakajima Kenzo of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" Criticism Association told Japanese reporters that the mass rally in Beijing protesting against the conclusion of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" once again illustrated how much the Chinese people value maintaining peace in Asia.

Nakajima Kenzo said: "Encouraged by the support of the Chinese people, I will concentrate my efforts on promoting the movement of intellectuals to prevent the revision of the treaty."

Kazami Akira, chairman of the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations, expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the Chinese people for supporting the Japanese people's struggle against the "Security Treaty." In his conversation with Japanese reporters, he pointed out that we must look back at the crimes Japan has committed against China in the past, and gain the determination to fight against this treaty (referring to the U.S.-Japan military alliance) from this kind of reflection.

Kazami Akira emphasized, "We Japanese people must rise up arm in arm with the people of China and other Asian and African countries and force imperialism to the point of desperation."

Yamahana Hideo, director of the Organization Bureau of the Japanese Socialist Party, said that the Socialist Party is very grateful for the Chinese people's support for the Japanese people's struggle.

    信中说，“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”为阻止修改日美“安全条约”从去年到现在先后展开了十六次统一行动，斗争规模正在空前扩大。我们确信，这个斗争在争取日本的和平与独立、维护民主、争取恢复日中邦交方面将起重大作用。
    信中指出，目前我们的斗争面临最重要的关头，对岸信介内阁和美帝国主义者给予决定性反击的机会已经到来。我们将以全体工人阶级为前锋，而以全民性团结为基础，斗争到底。
    信中强调说，中国人民强有力的支持，给了我们无尽的鼓舞和胜利的信心。
    据新华社12日讯　东京消息：日本共产党总书记宫本显治今天发表谈话，号召日本人民建立民族民主统一战线，集中全部力量，为粉碎美日反动派的阴谋而斗争，直到取得最后胜利。
    宫本显治指出，北京一百万人大示威标志着中国人民进一步加强对日本人民斗争的支援，它同时是亚洲人民坚决反对美帝国主义和岸信介建立军事同盟的大示威，日本人民从这里得到了很大鼓舞。
    宫本强调指出，在日本人民粉碎日美军事同盟的斗争日益高涨的情况下，日共将向日本人民揭露日本人民的两个敌人——美帝国主义和岸信介政府的本质。
    社会党国民运动委员长田中稔男也指出，中国人民的大示威给予日本人民无限的鼓舞，同时证明，去年春季社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎在北京所说的美帝国主义是日中两国人民的共同敌人这句话是完全正确的。田中强调指出，截至目前为止，已有六百万名以上的日本人民向国会提出了请愿书，这件事情表示着日本人民为阻止批准新“安全条约”的斗争已空前壮大。

      “赤旗报”指出，美帝国主义在战后为了实行它侵略全世界的政策，霸占了日本、南朝鲜、台湾、南越等地，并把这些地区变成了它对社会主义各国和亚洲独立国家发动侵略的军事基地。这是造成亚洲各国人民不幸和亚洲与世界和平威胁的最大根源。
      “赤旗报”强调指出，南朝鲜人民的斗争和日本人民反对新“安全条约”的斗争是为争取民族独立和民主的斗争，同时是对共同敌人美帝国主义的共同斗争，这个斗争同各国人民为维护亚洲与世界和平的斗争有着不可分割的密切关系。

    “赤旗报”强调指出，目前必须动员民主力量，发动以工人罢工斗争为中心的强有力的统一行动，迫使解散国会，阻止批准新“安全条约”，打倒岸信介内阁。
      “赤旗报”号召日本人民同朝鲜人民团结起来，加强共同斗争，迫使美军撤出南朝鲜和日本。“赤旗报”指出，日朝两国人民的正义斗争有全世界人民和舆论的支持，最后胜利一定属于日朝两国人民。

    安井指出，为了不辜负中国人民的期望，日本人民必须进一步团结起来，为打破威胁亚洲和平的日美军事同盟而斗争到底。
    日本工会总评议会议长太田熏指出，中国人民大示威的消息给予日本工人很大鼓舞。日中两国人民这样坚强的团结和联合斗争，最后必将能够粉碎日中两国人民共同敌人美帝国主义和岸信介集团的阴谋。
    日本妇女团体联合会会长栉田蕗强调说，北京一百万人大示威的消息给我们很大鼓舞，我们必须进一步扩展阻止批准新日美“安全条约”的斗争，粉碎日美军事同盟。
    她说，日本妇女团体联合会将以全副力量参加14日的大规模统一行动，目前正在为此作着努力。
    日美“安全条约”批判会的中岛健藏对日本记者说，北京抗议日美缔结新“安全条约”的群众大会，再次说明了中国人民多么重视维护亚洲的和平。
