The Chinese people do not regard the Japanese people's struggle against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" as someone else's business and remain aloof; on the contrary, they support it very seriously and wholeheartedly. When I saw this scene, I was deeply moved.

Recently, with the assistance of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the trade union organizations of the three countries—the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Korean Trade Union Federation, and the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan—issued a joint statement in Beijing on May 2, 1960, supporting the patriotic and just struggle of the South Korean people, the Japanese people's struggle against the "Security Treaty," and the struggle of the Japanese Miike coal miners. I would like to express my deep gratitude for this.

In the long history of the international workers' movement, there has never been an international joint action like this, where 30 million organized workers unite. Moreover, this joint action is not only for the patriotic and just struggle, but also directly struggles against the aggression of U.S. imperialism, to drive U.S. imperialism out of the Far East, thus having a clear anti-imperialist nature. In this sense, this action is particularly of great political significance. The workers of Asia believe that one day they must overthrow U.S. imperialism. Now this great opportunity has arrived.

The Japanese people's struggle against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" has lasted for more than a year. Regardless of the suppression and sabotage of U.S. imperialism and its running dog Nobusuke Kishi's clique, they are changing the balance of power day by day and constantly setting off climaxes of struggle. Currently, as the Japanese Diet deliberates the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" entering the final stage, which is also the most important period, the trade union organizations of the three countries issued a joint statement and immediately organized an international joint action led by millions of the working class.

The large-scale joint actions of Chinese workers to support the Japanese people's struggle against the "Security Treaty" are continuing to develop. What a great encouragement this should be for the struggle against the "Security Treaty," led by Japanese workers. What a heavy blow this concrete manifestation of Asian workers' solidarity should be to U.S. imperialism and its puppets. At the same time, the patriotic and just struggle of the South Korean people is in full swing. This struggle has quickly developed from demanding the resignation of Syngman Rhee and holding fair elections to a struggle for national independence, protesting against the interference and suppression of U.S. imperialism, demanding the withdrawal of American troops and the abolition of American military bases.

At this extraordinary moment, thirty million organized workers from China, Japan, and Korea support the patriotic and just struggle of the South Korean people and launch the inspiring joint action of the three countries' workers. This action fully embodies the desire of Asian workers to overthrow U.S. imperialism one day.

The joint statement of the three countries' trade unions is by no means an empty resolution. The mass activities launched by the Chinese working class and people from all walks of life to support the Japanese people's struggle against the "Security Treaty" will greatly encourage and inspire the anti-imperialist struggles that are already underway among the people in Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America.

Of course, our joint action is only the beginning. It is not enough to just express the desire for international solidarity and launch mass actions once or twice. Because this is a huge historical struggle that cannot be concluded just like that.

Last March, Inejiro Asanuma said in his speech during his visit to Beijing: "U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the Chinese and Japanese people." Mr. Guo Moruo also delivered a speech at the Stockholm Conference on Disarmament and International Cooperation, stating that "The root cause of world war lies in U.S. imperialism." We must review these words once again. We believe that in looking forward to this huge historical strategic action, the workers, peasants, and cultural figures of Asia work together to drive U.S. imperialism out of the Far East, clearly recognize the political urgency of winning complete national independence, and firmly grasp this point, adhere to the broad joint action shown in the joint statement of the three countries for a long time, and continue to move forward.

In the Japanese people's struggle against the "Security Treaty," some people emphasize the idea of achieving victory in one fell swoop. On the other hand, some people believe that the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" will be ratified by the Diet anyway, and it will be problematic to continue the struggle after ratification, so they have a slackening of effort. They are spreading this idea. There are also people who advocate that there is no need to rush into struggle in the era of peaceful coexistence and complete disarmament. They argue that instead of fighting the current enemy, we should accumulate strength.

Currently, the increasingly high-pitched and fierce struggle against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" prevents these various erroneous ideas from spreading. Since the establishment of the so-called "San Francisco Peace Treaty System," the worker brothers, based on the unbearable harm they have personally suffered from U.S. imperialism, have finally organized independent struggles and launched mass struggles in various places and workplaces. Mothers, holding their beloved children's hands, struggle in poor days. Based on their personal life experiences, they also express angry and hateful voices from the bottom of their hearts, saying "Kishi Nobusuke is a bad guy." The Japanese people's struggle against the "Security Treaty" is a struggle against U.S. imperialism. Participating in this struggle are not only organized workers, but also the grandfathers and mothers in the vast countryside, teachers and students. They all joyfully threw themselves into this struggle. They are also pursuing struggle policies guided by correct ideas. Their class consciousness and political awareness of fighting without fear of sacrifice are increasing day by day. Once they are aware, once they participate in the struggle, they will increase their awareness and accumulate experience more and more. In this case, new forms of propaganda and struggle emerge from the masses, and energetic activists are constantly increasing.

The experience of more than a year of struggle against the "Security Treaty" has taught us a lot. Whether in factories or in rural areas, action teams and "Anpo Ichiza" (theatrical troupe) against the "Security Treaty" were organized, centering on young workers and students, and carried out activities deep into the lives of the masses. 80% of university professors nationwide publicly stated their opposition to the "Security Treaty." Legal scholars, medical associations, women's federations, national mothers' federations, as well as Buddhist and Christian groups, have all taken the initiative to issue statements against the "Security Treaty" and began to organize mass gatherings and demonstrations within their respective scopes. Based on this initiative of the broad masses of people from all walks of life, we can expect the development of a national front against Kishi Nobusuke and against the "Security Treaty." Once there is such a broad popular force against the "Security Treaty," regardless of the Diet's deliberation of the new "Security Treaty," there must be no despair or abandonment of this struggle. On the contrary, the struggle against the new "Security Treaty" will be strengthened in the future. In the future, with the support of the Chinese people, we will tenaciously carry through the powerful struggle of the Asian people and the struggle to overthrow U.S. imperialism to the end.

In closing, I would like to express my gratitude to the Chinese people once again, and incidentally mention a few words that I often tell the factory workers:

"How much does the Chinese government and people care about the Japanese people's struggle against the 'Security Treaty'? No, how much do they regard it as their own struggle and support it as a strategic struggle to defend world peace? I will show you the evidence."

I took out a few "People's Daily" from my pocket, opened them and showed them to them. I said:

"Please see that the first, third, and fifth pages of this newspaper all have reports on the Japanese people's struggle against the 'Security Treaty.' Please see another one, the third and fifth pages, even the editorial is about the Japanese people's struggle against the 'Security Treaty.' Where else in the world is there a newspaper that reports the Japanese people's struggle against the 'Security Treaty' like this? Nowhere. The 'People's Daily' is full of news from various parts of Japan, such as Hokkaido, Osaka, Hiroshima, Omuta, etc. This fact provides evidence that the Chinese government and people regard the Japanese people's struggle against the 'Security Treaty' as their own business and are doing their best to fight together with the Japanese people."

I repeat: The Chinese government and people give strong and warm support to the patriotic and just struggle of the South Korean people and the Japanese people's struggle against the "Security Treaty," and fight together. I express my full respect for this and express our determination to fight bravely to the end. (Special contribution to this newspaper)

    新的反帝斗争的堡垒
    日本全国金属劳动组合副委员长　高野实
    中国人民不把日本人民反对日美“安全条约”的斗争当作别国的事情而置身局外，相反地是十分认真和尽心竭力地加以支援。当我看到这种情景时，我心里深深地受到感动。
    最近，在中华全国总工会的协助下，中华全国总工会、朝鲜职业总同盟和日本工会总评议会这三个国家的工会组织，于1960年5月2日在北京发表了联合声明，在支持南朝鲜人民爱国正义斗争的同时，支持了日本人民反对“安全条约”的斗争和日本三池煤矿工人的斗争。对此谨致以深厚的谢意。
    在国际工人运动的悠久历史上，还不曾有过像这次三千万有组织的工人团结起来结成国际联合行动的事情。而且这次的联合行动不仅是为了爱国正义斗争，而且直接地同美帝国主义的侵略进行斗争，要把美帝国主义从远东赶出去，因而具有鲜明的反帝斗争的性质。就这一点说来，这次行动尤其具有重大的政治意义。亚洲的工人们认为总有一天一定要打倒美帝国主义。现在这种大好的机会已经到来了。
    日本人民反对日美“安全条约”的斗争已经持续一年以上。他们不顾美帝国主义及其走狗岸信介集团的镇压和阴谋破坏，一天天地改变着力量对比关系，不断地掀起斗争的高潮。目前，正值日本国会审议新日美“安全条约”进入最后阶段因而也是最重要时期，三国工会组织发表联合声明，即时组织起以千百万工人阶级为首的国际联合行动。
    中国的工人为支持日本人民反对“安全条约”斗争而举行的大规模的联合行动，在继续发展中。这对于以日本工人为首的反对“安全条约”的斗争，该是多么大的鼓舞呵。这一亚洲工人团结的具体表现，对于美帝国主义及其傀儡，该是多么沉重的打击呵。与此同时，南朝鲜人民的爱国正义斗争方兴未艾。这一斗争已经从要求李承晚下台和举行公正的选举，很快地发展为抗议美帝国主义的干涉和镇压、要求撤走美国军队和取消美国军事基地的争取民族独立的斗争。
    在这不平凡的时刻，中国、日本和朝鲜三国有组织的三千万工人，支持南朝鲜人民的爱国正义斗争，发起三国工人的激动人心的联合行动。这一行动完全体现了亚洲工人总有一天一定要打倒美帝国主义的愿望。
    三国工会的联合声明，决不是空泛的决议书，中国工人阶级和其他各界人民为配合日本人民反对“安全条约”的斗争而展开群众性的活动，将大大地鼓舞和激励亚洲、中近东、非洲和拉丁美洲各地人民已经在进行的反帝斗争。
    当然，我们的联合行动还只是开始。仅仅一两次表达国际团结的愿望和发起群众行动还是不够的。因为这是一次不能就此完结的具有历史意义的巨大斗争。
    去年3月，浅沼稻次郎在访问北京时发表演说说：“美帝国主义是中日两国人民的共同敌人。”郭沫若先生也曾在斯德哥尔摩举行的裁军和国际合作大会上，发表了“世界战争的根源在于美帝国主义”的讲演。我们要再一次重温这些话。我们认为在展望这一巨大的具有历史意义的战略行动方面，亚洲的工人农民和文化界人士齐心协力，把美帝国主义赶出远东的天地，明确地认清赢得完全的民族独立在政治上的迫切意义，并且紧紧地抓住这一点，长期地坚持三国共同声明中所显示的广泛联合行动，不断地向前迈进。
    在日本人民反对“安全条约”的斗争中，有人强调一举而取得胜利的思想。另一方面也有人认为反正新的日美“安全条约”会在国会批准，批准以后再进行斗争就成问题了，因而有松劲思想。他们正在散布这种想法。还有人鼓吹在和平共处和全面裁军的时代不必急于进行斗争，他们主张，不同当前的敌人进行斗争而说什么应该积蓄力量。
    目前，日益高昂的反对日美“安全条约”的激烈斗争，使这些形形色色的错误思想不致泛滥。自从所谓“旧金山和约体制”确立以来，工人弟兄们根据切身受到的美帝国主义的不堪忍受的祸害，终于组织独自的斗争，在各个地方、各个工作场所掀起了群众性的斗争。母亲们握着心爱的孩子的手，在穷苦的日子中挣扎着。她们也基于切身的生活体验，从内心深处发出“岸信介是坏蛋”的恼怒和憎恶的声音。日本人民反对“安全条约”的斗争，是反对美帝国主义的斗争。参加这一斗争的不仅是有组织的工人，而且有广大农村的老爷爷和母亲、教师和学生。他们都欢欣鼓舞地投入了这个斗争。他们还在追求由正确思想所指导的斗争政策。他们不怕牺牲而进行斗争的阶级觉悟和政治觉悟一天天在提高。一旦有了觉悟，一旦参加了斗争，就会愈益提高觉悟和积累经验。在这种情况下，从群众当中就产生出新的宣传方式和斗争形式，而朝气勃勃的活动家也在不断地增加。
    一年多来反对“安全条约”斗争的经验，使我们领受了很多的教益。无论在工厂或是农村，以青年工人、学生为中心组织了反对“安全条约”行动队和“安保一座”（话剧团），深入群众的生活进行活动。全国有80％的大学教授公开表明反对“安全条约”。法律学者、医师会、妇女联合会、全国母亲联合会，以及佛教和基督教团体，都主动地发表反对“安全条约”的声明，开始组织各自范围的群众集会和示威游行。我们依据广大人民各阶层的这种主动性，就能够期待反对岸信介—反对“安全条约”国民战线的发展。一经有了这种意义的反对“安全条约”的广大人民力量，那就不论国会审议新“安全条约”的情况如何，也绝不能对于反对“安全条约”的斗争产生绝望情绪或者放弃这一斗争。恰恰相反，反对新“安全条约”的斗争，今后还要加强。今后，在中国人民的支援下，我们将顽强地把亚洲人民的强大斗争，打倒美帝国主义的斗争坚持到底。
    写到最后，我要以再一次向中国人民致谢的意思，附带提一下我经常跟工厂工人们述说的一番话：
    “中国的政府和人民对于日本人民反对‘安全条约’的斗争是怎样悬念，不，怎样作为自己的斗争加以重视、作为保卫世界和平的战略斗争给以支持呢？我给你们看一下证据。”
    我从口袋里掏出几张“人民日报”打开来给他们看。我说：
    “请看这张报纸上的第一版、三版、五版都有关于日本人民反对‘安全条约’斗争的报道。请再看另外一张，第三版、五版连社论都是关于日本人民反对‘安全条约’斗争的。世界上的其他地方哪里还有像这样报道日本人民反对‘安全条约’斗争的报纸呢？哪里也没有。在‘人民日报’上满载着北海道、大阪、广岛、大牟田等等日本各地方的消息。这一事实提供了中国政府和人民把日本人民反对‘安全条约’的斗争当作自己的事情而尽心竭力地同日本人民进行共同斗争的证据。”
    我再重复一遍：中国政府和人民对于南朝鲜人民的爱国正义斗争和日本人民反对“安全条约”的斗争给以强大而热烈的支援，并且共同进行斗争。对此谨表示满腔的敬意，并且表明我们勇敢地斗争到最后的决心。　　　　　　　　　　　　　（本报特约稿）
