A Happy Report of Continued Leap Forward in Agricultural Production
　　Guangdong -- A Good Harvest of Ten Million Mu of Winter Crops
　　Guangxi -- Overcoming Drought, Small Spring Crops Increase Production
　　Fujian -- Large Harvest Area and High Yield of Rapeseed
　　Guizhou -- A Great Harvest of More Than Six Million Mu of Rapeseed
　　Jiangxi -- Good News of Rapeseed Bumper Harvest Spreads Everywhere
　　Yunnan -- Dehong Dai Autonomous Prefecture Reports Success in Spring Planting

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 7th dispatch: Guangdong Province has basically completed the harvesting of more than 12 million mu of spring-harvested grain crops such as sweet potatoes, wheat, barley, peas, and potatoes. News from various places indicates that these crops have generally had a bumper harvest. The main spring-harvested crop—winter sweet potatoes—has grown particularly vigorously this year. The 1,500-plus mu of winter sweet potatoes in Miancheng Commune, Lufeng County, have achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, with the average yield per mu increasing by more than 70% compared to last year. Wheat yields have also generally increased compared to last year. The 509 mu of wheat in the Fengshou Brigade of Yuncheng Commune, Xinxing County, have increased their average yield by more than double compared to last year. The harvest of potatoes, peas, and broad beans has also been very good in various places.

The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has attached great importance to winter-planted and spring-harvested crops. As early as last year, it proposed that both main grain production and miscellaneous grain production should be grasped to increase production. Therefore, after the autumn harvest last year, various places deployed large labor forces and launched a high tide of rushing to plant winter crops, with the planting area increasing by more than double compared to the previous year. After planting, people's communes in various places organized professional teams to strengthen field management, so spring-harvested crops generally grew well.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 7th dispatch: Amid the chorus of reports of a bumper harvest of wheat and barley, Fujian Province has also received the good news of an unprecedented bumper harvest of spring-harvested rapeseed. More than 600,000 mu of rapeseed in the province are now ripe and entering the busy harvest season. As of the 4th, more than 420,000 mu have been harvested in the province. Guangze County, located in the Wuyi Mountains, has completely harvested more than 12,000 mu of rapeseed, with an average yield per mu increasing by more than 30% compared to last year. The 320 mu already harvested by the Shuinan Farm have an average yield of 199 jin per mu, an increase of 1.8 times compared to last year.

This year, the province's rapeseed planting area has expanded by more than two times compared to last year. Party committees at all levels have vigorously promoted high-yield command fields, promoting the high-yield rapeseed movement in various places. At the same time, in the process of planting, various places have carried out mass-based cultivation technology innovation movements according to different natural conditions and the growth characteristics of rapeseed, increasing yields.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 7th dispatch: Jiangxi has overcome the three major disasters of drought, flooding, and frost, and more than 3 million mu of rapeseed have generally had a bumper harvest. The broad masses of people's commune members are overjoyed, saying that this is the first piece of good news of the continuous great leap forward in agricultural production in 1960.

Jiangxi Province has harvested more than 2 million mu of rapeseed. Hukou, a province-wide "100 jin" rapeseed county, has reached a new peak of high yield this year with 65,000 mu of rapeseed, with a yield of more than 100 jin per mu. In Yichun Prefecture, the average yield per mu of rapeseed in Yichun, Pingxiang, Fengcheng, Shanggao, Fenyi and other counties has increased by several percent compared to last year. The 3.56 million "Rapeseed Kings" planted by various communes in Leping County using scattered land in front of and behind houses and along fields, each averaging more than three liang of rapeseed, which is more than double the yield of local rapeseed.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 7th dispatch: Guangxi's more than 6 million mu of spring-harvested crops have successively ripened, and are currently entering the busy harvest season.

This year, Guangxi's spring-harvested crops have generally had a bumper harvest. As of May 5, a total of 2.39 million mu of wheat, peas, buckwheat, winter sweet potatoes, and rapeseed have been harvested in the region, and the output of all types of crops has increased compared to last year. Bobai County has planted a total of 229,000 mu of spring-harvested crops this year, all of which have been harvested, with an average yield per mu increasing by 45% compared to last year. Cexi County has harvested more than 12,000 mu of its 13,000 mu of wheat, with the yield per mu nearly doubling compared to last year.

The bumper harvest of spring-harvested crops in Guangxi is a victory in the fight against drought.

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 7th dispatch: Guizhou has obtained a great harvest of rapeseed. Xingyi, Pingba and other counties have basically finished harvesting.

This year, the total rapeseed harvest area in Guizhou reached more than 6 million mu. Judging from the threshing situation in various places, the yield per unit area of rapeseed has generally increased compared to last year. The average yield per mu of the 92,541 mu of rapeseed that has already been threshed in Xingyi County has increased by more than 70% compared to last year. Among them, there are more than 40,000 mu of high-yield fields, with an average yield of 130 jin of rapeseed per mu. The 200 mu of rapeseed that has been harvested in Jiucang Management Area of Maoba Commune, Renhuai County, has an average yield of 427 jin.

The unprecedented bumper harvest of rapeseed on the Guizhou Plateau is a great victory for the Party's policy of combining multiple planting and multiple harvesting with high yield and multiple harvesting and the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture.

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 7th dispatch: The 190,000 mu of spring-planted crops in the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan Province, have generally had a bumper harvest. The 82,000-plus mu of wheat, broad beans, peas, and rapeseed that have now been harvested have an average yield per mu higher than in 1959. In the past, the ethnic minorities in this prefecture did not have the habit of planting spring-planted crops. It was not until 1958 that large-scale planting began, changing one crop per year to three crops per year. After the autumn harvest in 1959, the counties expanded the planting area of spring-planted crops to 190,000 mu. During the growth period of spring-planted crops, the people of all ethnic groups continued to fertilize, water, and cultivate the soil, and fought against various natural disasters, ensuring that all spring-planted crops achieved a bumper harvest. Currently, people of all ethnic groups are earnestly carrying out seed selection and seed preservation work, preparing seeds for the continued leap forward in spring production next year.

    农业生产继续跃进的一张喜报
    广东——一千万亩越冬作物丰收
  　广西——战胜干旱小春作物增产
    福建——油菜收获面积大产量高
  　贵州——六百多万亩油菜大丰收
    江西——油菜大丰收喜报到处传
    云南——德宏傣自治州小春报捷
    据新华社广州7日电　广东省一千二百多万亩甘薯、小麦、大麦、豌豆、马铃薯等春收粮食作物已经基本收完。各地传来的消息表明，这些作物普遍丰收。主要春收作物——越冬甘薯，今年长得特别旺盛。陆丰县棉城公社一千五百多亩冬薯获得空前丰收，平均亩产量比去年提高七成以上。小麦产量一般也比去年提高，新兴县云城公社丰收大队的五百零九亩小麦平均产量比去年增加一倍多。各地马铃薯、豌豆、蚕豆的收成也很好。
    中共广东省委十分重视冬种春收作物，早在去年就提出既要抓主粮生产，也要抓杂粮增产。因而，在去年秋收结束后各地就调配劳动大军，掀起了突击抢种越冬作物的生产高潮，种植面积比上一年增加二倍多。种下以后，各地人民公社都组织专业队，加强了田间管理，因而春收作物一般生长良好。
    据新华社福州7日电　福建省在大小麦普告大丰收的声浪中，又传来春收油菜空前大丰收的捷报。全省六十多万亩油菜现已黄熟进入收获大忙时期，到4日止，全省已收割四十二万多亩。处在武夷山岭上的光泽县一万二千多亩油菜已全部收割完毕，平均亩产比去年增长三成以上。水南农场已收获的三百二十亩，平均亩产一百九十九斤，比去年增产一点八倍。
    今年，全省油菜播种面积比去年扩大两倍多，各级党委都大搞丰产指挥田，推动了各地油菜丰产运动。同时各地在种植过程中都根据不同自然条件和油菜生长特点，开展了群众性的耕作技术革新运动，提高了产量。
    据新华社南昌7日电　江西战胜旱、涝、霜冻三大灾害，三百多万亩油菜普告大丰收。广大人民公社社员欢欣鼓舞，都说这是1960年农业生产持续大跃进的第一张喜报。
    江西省油菜已经收割二百多万亩。全省油菜百斤红旗县——湖口，今年全县六万五千亩油菜又攀高产高峰，亩产达到了一百斤以上。宜春专区的宜春、萍乡、丰城、上高、分宜等县今年油菜平均每亩产量都比去年增产几成。乐平县各公社利用屋前屋后、田边地角零星土地种植的三百五十六万株“油菜王”，每株平均收菜籽达三两以上，比当地油菜产量高一倍多。
    据新华社南宁7日电　广西六百多万亩春收作物相继黄熟，目前进入收割大忙。
    今年，广西春收作物普遍丰收。到5月5日止，全区已收割小麦、豌豆、荞麦、冬红薯、油菜籽等共二百三十九万亩，各类作物都比去年增产。博白县今年共种二十二万九千多亩春收作物，已全部收割完毕，平均亩产比去年增产45％。岑溪县一万三千多亩小麦，已收割一万二千多亩，亩产比去年将近翻一番。
    广西的春收作物的丰收，是与干旱斗争的胜利。
    据新华社贵阳7日电　贵州油菜籽获得大丰收。兴义、平坝等县已基本收完。
    贵州今年油菜籽收获面积共达六百多万亩。从各地已经收割脱粒的情况来看，菜籽单位产量普遍比去年提高。兴义县已经脱粒的九万二千五百四十一亩油菜，平均亩产量比去年增长七成多，其中有四万多亩丰产田，平均亩产菜籽一百三十斤。仁怀县茅坝公社九仓管理区已收的二百亩油菜，平均亩产四百二十斤七两。
    贵州高原油菜空前丰收，是党的多种多收和高产多收相结合的方针和农业“八字宪法”的伟大胜利。
    据新华社昆明7日电　云南省德宏傣族景颇族自治州十九万亩小春作物普遍大丰收。现在已经收完的八万二千多亩小麦、蚕豆、豌豆和油菜，平均亩产量比1959年增产。过去，这个州的少数民族没有种植小春作物的习惯，到1958年，才开始大面积种植，变一熟为三熟。在1959年秋收后，各县又将小春作物的栽种面积扩大到十九万亩。在小春作物成长期间，各族人民又不断地进行追肥浇水和中耕锄草工作，并且与各种自然灾害展开了斗争，保证各项小春作物都获得丰收。目前，各族人民正在认真进行选种、留种工作，为明年小春生产继续跃进作好种子准备。（附图片）
