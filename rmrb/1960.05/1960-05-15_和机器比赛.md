    The Nantung City People's Bank successfully trial-produced a money-counting machine. The leadership decided to let teller Zhang Jingxia use it first. When using the machine to count money for the first time, some minor problems are inevitable. However, Zhang Jingxia felt that the machine was ultimately not as good as her hands. She even vowed, "I will never use a machine in my life." Because of this, the Party organization decided to organize a competition between manual and machine money counting.
    There were four people participating in the manual money counting, and three people participating in the machine money counting. Before the competition, Zhang Jingxia of the manual money counting group practiced particularly hard. Before dawn, she would take a stack of banknotes and practice swishing them. She wanted to do everything possible to make manual money counting surpass the machine.
    One afternoon, the machine and manual competition began. The room was filled with onlookers. The whirring sound of the machine and the swishing sound of manual money counting intertwined. Zhang Jingxia's eyes constantly glanced at the money-counting machine, secretly comparing it with her own count. Before long, the manual money counters were sweating profusely, but the people using the machine were so relaxed and at ease, pressing the button, the banknotes flowed like a waterfall. Next to the money-counting machine, the more bundles of banknotes that were counted, the more the manual money counters fell behind. Despite using all their skills, it was still to no avail.
    The result of the competition was that the machine counted an average of 47,000 banknotes per hour without any errors; manual counting was only 16,000 banknotes per person, and there were two errors. This time, Zhang Jingxia was truly convinced. She said, "The machine is better after all."

    和机器比赛
    南通市人民银行的点钞机试制成功了。领导上决定先让点钞员张静侠使用。初用机器点钞，总不免会出些小毛病。可是张静侠觉得机器到底不如手好。她竟然发誓说：“一生一世也不用机器”。为了这件事，党组织决定组织一场手工和机器点钞比赛。
    参加这次手工点钞的有四个人，参加机器点钞的三个人。比赛之前，手工点钞这个组，张静侠练得特别起劲，天麻麻亮他就拿着一扎钞票刷刷地练起来。她要想尽一切办法，使手工点钞胜过机器。
    一个下午，机器和手工比赛开始了。屋里站满了参观的人。机器的呜呜声和手工点钞的刷刷声交织成一片。张静侠的目光不时地斜视着点钞机，暗暗地和自己的数目作比较。没有多久，手工点钞的人已经满头大汗，可是用机器点钞的人却那样悠闲自在地揿揿电钮，钞票就像瀑布一样流着。点钞机旁边，点捆的钞票越多，手工点钞也越来越赶不上了。尽管她们使出了全部本领，仍然无济于事。
    比赛结果，机器点钞平均每小时四万七千张，没有差错；手工点钞，每人只有一万六千张，还出了两次差错。这次张静侠真是心服口服。她说：“到底还是机器好”。
