Jinxi Machine Factory Vigorously Cultivates Intellectuals from the Working Class
Forty-Three Workers Graduate from University

This newspaper reports that forty-three workers from the Jinxi Machine Factory in Taiyuan, Shanxi, have completed their studies at the factory's part-work, part-study university after more than a year of learning, and have completed their graduation designs. On May 20th, the factory held a graduation ceremony, where Zhong Fuxiang, Vice Minister of the First Ministry of Machine Building, Xie Yutian, Deputy Director of the Culture and Education Department of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee, and Li Qi, First Secretary of the Taiyuan Municipal Party Committee of the CPC, awarded university graduation certificates.

The part-work, part-study university of Jinxi Machine Factory was established on July 1, 1958, and was named "Jinji Institute of Technology". The first phase established two classes, one in mechanical manufacturing and one in electrical engineering. The university first opened the door to veteran workers. Among the forty-three students in the first phase, thirty-five were veteran workers, with an average length of service of eleven years and an average technical grade of five. Their original education levels were very low, and ten of them were illiterate at the time of liberation. Thanks to the care and cultivation of the Party, they had all basically reached the cultural level of high school and secondary technical school before entering the university. The learning method of the university is part-work and part-study, with classes in the morning and work in the afternoon. Teachers are hired mainly on a part-time basis, with leading cadres and engineering technicians from the factory teaching courses, and a small number of full-time teachers are also assigned. The university also cooperates with some universities, asking them to help teach some of the more difficult courses. In order to strengthen the leadership of the school, the Party specially appointed Comrade Ma Bin, the factory director, as the president of the college, and a temporary Party and League branch was established in the school.

The school's curriculum is established according to the characteristics of production and students. Based on the curriculum and teaching materials of ordinary universities, its own curriculum and teaching materials have been rearranged. Political courses and basic courses must be systematically learned, while professional courses adopt the mass line method, with leaders, teachers, and students discussing, studying, and revising to determine them. The courses and teaching content that students already know are deleted, while some modern new technologies urgently needed in production and new achievements in domestic technical innovation and technical revolution are compiled into teaching materials and supplemented. In teaching, the college made full use of the factory's favorable conditions and promoted the advantages of part-work and part-study and the fact that all students understand technology. Wherever there are conditions for on-site teaching, classroom teaching and on-site teaching are combined, such as going to the steelmaking workshop when teaching steelmaking, and going to the motor workshop when teaching motors. In order to closely integrate theory and practice, the factory also continuously adjusts the work of students according to the progress of their studies. For example, after the students have completed a part of the basic courses and professional courses and have a certain amount of technical theoretical knowledge, the factory will transfer them to the technical department and use production tasks as the students' course design. In this process, students learn and use what they learn, and when they encounter problems in the process of use, they bring them back to the classroom for discussion and resolution. This greatly exercises the students' ability to comprehensively use various knowledge to solve practical problems, and also solves many problems for the factory. According to the statistics of the twenty-four students in the mechanical class, in the past year alone, they have helped the workshop complete seventy-six innovations, increasing production efficiency by two to one hundred times. In order to ensure the students' study time, the factory's Party committee strictly stipulates that any workshop that wants to draw students for overtime work must be approved by the factory director. The factory Party committee also stipulates that the spare time on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday afternoons and from 7:00 to 9:00 on Sunday mornings are for students' self-study and teachers' tutoring time, and no one is allowed to occupy them. The factory Party committee also specially designated three teachers to tutor a part of the students who have particular difficulty in learning, requiring them to ensure that they do not fall behind.

Due to the adoption of the above series of measures, they finally completed the courses that generally require 3,190 hours of study in ordinary universities in 1,549 hours. Before graduation, the students made eight graduation designs aimed at key problems in the factory's production, such as mechanized hot-packaging machines, automatic seam-closing machines, and automatic unloading machines. Some of the designs have already been successfully manufactured by them personally and put into production. For example, the automatic straightening and blanking machine, which the factory had tried to manufacture many times in the past, but had not been designed successfully because of its complex structure and too many parts. This time, the first graduates of the Institute of Technology finally designed and manufactured it successfully. This machine has already played a role in production, increasing production efficiency by forty-two times.

    晋西机器厂大力培养工人阶级知识分子
    四十三名工人大学毕业
    本报讯　山西太原晋西机器厂的四十三名工人，在该厂的半工半读大学经过一年多的学习，已全部完成了他们的学业，并作出了毕业设计。5月20日，该厂举行了毕业仪式，由第一机械工业部副部长钟夫翔、中共山西省委文教部副部长解玉田和中共太原市委第一书记李琦授予大学毕业证书。
    晋西机器厂的半工半读大学，在1958年7月1日诞生，全名叫做“晋机工学院”。第一期设了两个班，一个机械制造班，一个电机班。大学首先给老工人大开方便之门，第一期的四十三名学员中，就有三十五名是老工人，平均工龄是十一年，平均技术等级是五级。他们原来文化水平都很低，其中十个人解放时还是文盲。由于党的关怀和培养，他们在进入大学以前，都基本上达到高中和中等技术学校文化水平。大学的学习方式是半工半读，上午上课，下午工作。教师是根据以兼职为主的原则，一方面聘请该厂领导干部和工程技术人员任课，同时也配备少量专职教师，并和一些大学协作，请他们帮助教一些较难的课程。为了加强学校的领导，党特任命工厂厂长马斌同志担任学院院长，并在学校中建立了临时党团支部。
    学校的课程，是根据生产和学员的特点设立的。以普通大学的课程和教材为基础，重新安排了自己的课程和教材。政治课和基础课都必须系统地学好，专业课则采取群众路线的办法，由领导、教师和学员在一起讨论、研究修改确定。学员已经懂得的课程和教学内容，都予以删去，同时把一些生产中迫切需要的现代新技术和国内技术革新、技术革命中的新成就编成教材，补充进去。在教学上，学院充分利用了工厂的有利条件，发扬了半工半读、学员都懂技术的长处。凡是有条件进行现场教学的地方，就把课堂教学和现场教学结合起来进行，如讲炼钢就到炼钢车间，讲电机就到电机车间等。为了理论和实践紧密地结合，工厂还不断根据学习的进度调整学员的工作。如学员们学完了一部分基础课和专业课后，有了一定的技术理论知识，工厂就调他们到技术室，把生产任务作为学员的课程设计。学员在这个过程中，学了就用，用中间碰到了问题，再提到课堂上讨论解决。这样，大大锻炼了学员综合运用各种知识解决实际问题的能力，又给工厂解决了许多问题。据机械班二十四位学员的统计，仅去年一年的时间，他们就帮助车间完成了七十六项革新，分别提高生产效率两倍到一百倍。为了保证学员的学习时间，工厂党委严格规定任何车间要抽学员加班，必须经过厂长批准。工厂党委还规定每星期二、四、六下午的业余时间和星期日上午七至九时，为学员自习和教师辅导的时间，任何人不得占用。对学习特别吃力的一部分学员，工厂党委还专门指定了三名教师进行辅导，要求保证他们不掉队。
    由于采取上述一系列的措施，他们终于把一般大学需要学习三千一百九十个小时的课程，在一千五百四十九个小时内学成了。在结业前，学员们针对着工厂生产上的关键问题，作出了机械化热包机、自动结缝机、自动下线机等八项毕业设计，有的设计已经由他们亲自参加制造成功，并且投入了生产。例如自动校直下料机，工厂过去曾多次想制造，但是因为结构复杂，零件太多，一直没有设计成功。这次工学院第一届毕业生，终于设计出来，并制造成功。这台机器已经在生产中发挥了作用，使生产效率提高了四十二倍。
