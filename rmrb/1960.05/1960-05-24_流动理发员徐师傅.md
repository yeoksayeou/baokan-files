For several years in Karamay, there has often been a barber moving among the well teams, employee dormitories, and workshops, providing haircuts for the workers. This is Master Xu Fusheng, a barber from the mining area's service department.

In order to prevent workers from delaying production due to haircuts, Xu Fusheng often travels dozens of miles to reach various well sites; he hitches rides when available, and walks when not. He has been doing this consistently for several years.

Once, Karamay experienced a torrential rainstorm, and the area around Well 201 in Baijiantan was flooded. The entire team ate and lived at the well site, persevering with the drilling. For over a month, no one left the site, and some people's hair grew very long. After Xu Fusheng learned about this, he carried his barber tools and waded through the water to the well team to give haircuts. When he arrived at the well site, his feet were already numb from the cold water, but he only rubbed them briefly before heading to the tent to start cutting hair. In one day, he gave haircuts to all twenty-odd members of the team. The well team's instructor shook his hand and said, "Master Xu, thank you. We will not leave the well site until we complete this 3,000-meter deep well."

    流动理发员徐师傅
    几年来，在克拉玛依经常有一个理发师傅流动在井队、职工宿舍、车间，为职工们理发。这就是矿区服务部门的理发员徐福生师傅。
    徐福生为了使工人不因为理发耽误生产，他常常要跑几十里路，赶到各个井场去；走这么远的路，有车就搭车，没车就步行，几年来，一直没有间断过。
    有一次，克拉玛依下了一场暴雨，白碱累201井地区周围一片汪洋，全队同志都吃在井场，住在井场，坚持钻进。一个多月没有一个人离开井场，有的人头发长得老长。徐福生知道这件事情后，就背起一套理发工具，涉水到井队去理发。到井场时，两脚被冷水浸得已经有些麻木，但他只揉了揉脚，便走向帐篷开始理发。一天，他就给全队二十几个人全理了发。井队指导员握着他的手说：“徐师傅，谢谢您。我们不打完这口三千米的深井，决不离开井场。”
