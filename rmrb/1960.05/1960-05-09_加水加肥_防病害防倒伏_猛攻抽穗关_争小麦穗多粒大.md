    Vigorously Attack the Heading Stage, Strive for More Ears and Bigger Grains of Wheat
    Shandong:
    Expand Water Sources and Irrigate Wheat More
    (Xinhua News Agency) Various people's communes in Shandong are taking comprehensive measures to vigorously attack the wheat heading and flowering stage, striving for more ears, bigger ears, more grains, and heavier grains.
    After successfully crossing the greening and jointing stages, wheat growth in Shandong is good, with first-class seedlings increasing to over 46%, and 40% of third-class seedlings have been upgraded.
    Based on the continuous development of drought and the gradual reduction of water sources, various places are making every effort to expand water sources and increase the irrigated area of wheat fields. Of the 50 million mu of wheat threatened by drought in the province, 35.5 million mu have been irrigated for flowering and grain filling, and 32.2 million mu have been loosened to conserve soil moisture. Several mountainous communes in Zibo City recently dug out 11 mountain springs, intercepted 65 subsurface flows, and established 363 water storage ponds and pumping stations, meeting the water needs of third-class seedlings. For mountainous and hilly areas and "dead-end land" lacking water sources, various places have adopted methods such as diverting water up the mountains, raising canals, irrigating distant areas, and developing waterwheel groups and winch groups, with very good results.
    Based on the gradual warming of the weather and the ease with which various diseases and insect pests can grow and spread, various places are taking measures of checking and preventing simultaneously, and have already prevented and controlled rust on 3.16 million mu.
    Anhui:
    Vigorously Prevent and Control Wheat Rust
    (Xinhua News Agency) People's communes in various parts of Anhui Province are firmly grasping the work of rust prevention and control, striving for wheat without diseases and pests, increasing grain and weight, and ensuring a bumper harvest.
    The growth of more than 37 million mu of wheat in Anhui Province is good, and early wheat has begun to develop ears and head. However, due to more rainy days in April and the recent warming weather, rust has a tendency to spread. This situation has aroused the high attention of party committees at all levels. Relying on the superior conditions of the people's communes, various places have taken preemptive measures. From the province to the commune production team, rust prediction and forecasting institutions have been established at all levels, forming a close intelligence network, placing rust under the surveillance of the broad masses. Fuyang Prefecture mobilized more than 500,000 laborers, together with more than 13,000 rust prevention professional teams, to go deep into the fields to conduct surprise inspections of soil moisture, plants, and leaves, inspecting and treating simultaneously. The wheat fields sprayed and treated by rust prevention professional team members and the masses throughout the province have reached more than 5.7 million mu, exceeding the area of diseased wheat fields, and the spread of rust has been controlled.
    Qinghai:
    High Quality of Spring Wheat Management
    (Xinhua News Agency) The 500,000 mu of spring wheat in Qinghai Province generally have good emergence. The province is launching a spring wheat field management campaign with high quality, high work efficiency, and comprehensive technical measures.
    Due to the large-scale reclamation of wasteland last winter and this spring, the sown area has greatly increased, and a large-scale high-yield movement has been launched. This year's wheat field management in Qinghai Province faces the situation of large tasks and high quality requirements. According to the requirements of grasping early, grasping all, grasping carefully, and grasping skillfully, all communes and production teams have formulated field management plans and specific management plans for each link, checking seedlings and replanting, weeding, watering, topdressing, and preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests as early as possible.
    Many people's communes have carried out technical innovation and technical revolution, reforming field management tools and management techniques. Cadres, technicians, and members of the Mila Gou Commune in Minhe County jointly researched and created an animal-powered topdressing machine, which can topdress more than 100 mu per day, increasing work efficiency by 25 times compared with manual topdressing. Xunhua Salar Autonomous County has realized the mechanization of weeding, increasing work efficiency by six times compared with weeding with a shovel, greatly reducing the labor intensity of the members.

    加水加肥　防病害防倒伏
    猛攻抽穗关　争小麦穗多粒大
    山东：
    扩大水源多浇麦
    据新华社讯　山东各地人民公社采取综合措施，猛攻小麦抽穗扬花关，争取穗多穗大粒多粒重。
    在胜利跨过返青、拔节关以后，山东各地小麦生长良好，一类苗已增加到46％以上，三类苗中有40％升了级。
    各地根据旱情持续发展、水源逐渐减少的情况，千方百计地广开水源，扩大麦田浇水面积。全省受到干旱威胁的五千万亩小麦，有三千五百五十万亩已经浇了扬花灌浆水，有三千二百二十多万亩进行了松土保墒。淄博市几个山区公社最近挖出山泉十一处，截潜流六十五处，建立了蓄水池、扬水站三百六十三处。满足了三类苗的用水。对于山岭岗地和水源缺乏的“死角地”，各地采取了引水上山，加高渠道，并流远浇，大搞水车群、辘轳群等办法浇水，效果很好。
    各地根据天气渐暖，各种病虫害容易滋长蔓延的情况，采取边检查、边防治的办法，已防治锈病三百一十六万亩。
    安徽：
    大力防治麦锈病
    据新华社讯　安徽省各地人民公社狠抓锈病防治工作，力争小麦无病害，增粒增重保丰收。
    安徽省三千七百多万亩小麦生长情况良好，早麦已开始孕穗、抽穗。但由于4月份阴雨较多，最近天气又转暖，锈病有蔓延趋势。这种情况引起了各级党委的高度重视。各地依靠人民公社的优越条件，做到了先发制敌。从省到公社生产队，层层建立锈病预测预报机构，形成严密的情报网，把锈病置于广大群众的监视之下。阜阳专区发动五十多万个劳动力，同一万三千多个防锈病专业队一起，深入田间，突击查墒、查棵、查叶，边查边治。全省经过防锈病专业队队员和群众喷药防治的麦田已达五百七十多万亩，超过了发病麦田面积，已控制了锈病的扩展。
    青海：
    春麦管理质量高
    据新华社讯　青海省五十万亩春小麦，普遍出苗良好。全省正掀起高质量、高工效和全面抓技术措施的春麦田间管理运动。
    由于去冬今春大开荒，播种面积大大增加，又开展了大面积丰产运动，青海省今年麦田管理工作面临着任务大、质量要求高的形势。根据抓早、抓全、抓精、抓巧的要求，各公社、生产队都制订了田间管理规划和各个环节的具体管理计划，及早查苗补苗、除草、浇水、追肥、防治病虫害。
    许多人民公社开展技术革新和技术革命，改革了田间管理工具和管理技术。民和县米拉沟公社的干部、技术员和社员共同研究创造了畜力追肥机，每天可追肥一百多亩，比人工追肥提高工效二十五倍。循化撒拉族自治县实现了除草手锄化，比原来用铲子除草提高工效六倍，大大减轻了社员的劳动强度。
