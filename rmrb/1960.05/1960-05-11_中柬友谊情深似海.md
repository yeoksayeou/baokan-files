    Profound Sino-Cambodian Friendship
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Yu Minsheng, Shen Shouyuan
    As we take up our pens, the moving scenes of the Cambodian people welcoming Premier Zhou Enlai vividly appear before our eyes, one after another. The friendship between our two countries is so deeply rooted in the hearts of the people that it has become an indispensable part of their lives. This friendship is higher than the mountains and deeper than the sea.
    On the morning of May 7th, Premier Zhou Enlai arrived in Kampong Cham, the second largest city in Cambodia. This city has only over twenty thousand residents, but the number of people who came from all over Kampong Cham Province to welcome the Chinese Premier exceeded forty thousand. The Governor of Kampong Cham Province told us that in order to welcome the Chinese Premier, the authorities had declared a holiday for the entire province. Some people had come from all over the province to Kampong Cham the day before, waiting at the airport and along the roads that the Chinese Premier would pass before dawn. When Premier Zhou Enlai and Prince Sihanouk stepped off the plane, when they rode in a car to the Kampong Cham Textile Factory, built with Chinese aid, to attend the opening ceremony, tens of thousands of people happily shouted "Friendship" and cheerfully cheered "Long live!"
    After Premier Zhou Enlai cut the ribbon for the factory's opening ceremony, he, along with Prince Sihanouk, Prime Minister Pho Proeung, and Vice Premier Chen Yi, entered the factory to view each workshop. In the spacious workshops, the modern textile machines aided by China gleamed. Cambodian workers and Chinese experts standing next to the machines eagerly awaited the arrival of this moment of friendship. Premier Zhou Enlai, Prince Sihanouk, Prime Minister Pho Proeung, and Vice Premier Chen Yi walked to the machines and took turns pressing the buttons to start them. This was a moment of profound significance, and everyone present warmly applauded this friendly scene. After touring the factory for a week and taking a short break, Premier Zhou Enlai, Prince Sihanouk, and Vice Premier Chen Yi happily picked up their pens and wrote inscriptions on the guest book praising the friendship between the two countries.
    Premier Zhou Enlai wrote: "The people of China and Cambodia will forever be friends, forever cooperate, help each other, and learn from each other. Everything that industrially advanced countries in the world can do, the people of our two countries can certainly do as well. Long live Sino-Cambodian friendship! Long live the Kingdom of Cambodia! Long live His Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk!"
    This scene inspired Vice Premier Chen Yi's poetic inspiration, and he immediately composed a poem: "Visiting the Kampong Cham factory, the building is beautiful and new. Created by the Cambodian people, a symbol of Sino-Cambodian friendship. Cooperation between the Prince and the Premier, the two countries will always be close."
    Premier Zhou Enlai praised Vice Premier Chen Yi's quick poetic talent, and Prince Sihanouk could hardly restrain his hearty laughter.
    Next, Prince Sihanouk expressed his friendly feelings with a stroke of his pen. He wrote: "The Kampong Cham Textile Factory, for which Premier Zhou Enlai cut the ribbon, is now the most supreme symbol of Cambodian-Chinese friendship. China's unconditional aid to Cambodia has provided it with very good conditions for building the country. Cambodia's desire to achieve economic independence will soon be realized. This is a symbol of the unity of the Cambodian and Chinese peoples. The visits of Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi will be faithfully recorded in the history of Cambodia and the history of Kampong Cham. Long live Cambodian-Chinese friendship! Long live His Excellency Premier Zhou Enlai! Long live His Excellency Vice Premier Chen Yi! May the friendship between Cambodia and China last forever!"
    As Prince Sihanouk finished writing his inscription, Premier Zhou Enlai stepped forward, held his hand and said, "Your Royal Highness is too kind!" Sihanouk replied: "I am stating a fact."
    At two o'clock in the afternoon of May 7th, Premier Zhou Enlai arrived at Prince Sihanouk's villa in Kep, a coastal resort in southern Cambodia. When Premier Zhou Enlai's special plane landed at Kampong Trach Airport, more than twenty kilometers from Kep, although the scorching sun was high in the sky, and even the breeze blowing from the sea was burning hot, tens of thousands of people had been waiting in the scorching sun for seven or eight hours to welcome Premier Zhou Enlai. On the road from the airport to the villa in Kep, friendly slogans were posted in every village and town, and Chinese and Cambodian national flags and portraits of Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, and Chen Yi were displayed everywhere. Gray-haired old ladies, old men leaning on crutches, enthusiastic young men and women, and three or four-year-old children crowded along both sides of the road. Some people respectfully held up portraits of Chinese leaders pasted on wooden boards; some children waved Chinese flags, chanting slogans of friendship; some families came out to kneel by the roadside, with their hands clasped together, to express their most sincere wishes to the Chinese Premier.
    When Premier Zhou left Kep for the Long Por Reservoir, it was already late in the day. Unexpectedly, thousands of people from nearby villages, who had come to welcome Premier Zhou, gathered around the archway made of palm leaves at the reservoir. They had waited there from the hot noon until the chilly dusk to see the Premier. When the crowd saw Premier Zhou Enlai finally appear, their enthusiasm burst forth. They jumped up and down happily, cheered, and all rushed towards Premier Zhou Enlai. When the Chinese Premier opened the floodgates of the reservoir, and a stream of clear water flowed through the irrigation canals into the fields, thunderous applause and cheers erupted from the crowd. At this moment, people remembered Prince Sihanouk participating in voluntary labor at the construction site when the reservoir began to be built! Today, shortly after the reservoir was completed, Premier Zhou Enlai opened the floodgates of the reservoir here, allowing clear water to irrigate the fertile land. When a Cambodian friend talked about this incident, he linked the names of Prince Sihanouk and Premier Zhou Enlai together, and he said excitedly: "The Prince and the Premier cooperate in friendship, and the people of the two countries rejoice!"
    It was already pitch black, but the hearts of the people of the Kingdom were burning with enthusiasm. On the thirty-kilometer road from the Long Por Reservoir to Kampot City to attend the banquet held for him by the Governor of Kampot Province, enthusiastic people still stood in the darkness to welcome Premier Zhou.
    In Kampot City, the vast majority of residents came out to welcome Premier Zhou Enlai. The streets were packed with people, and every door was hung with five-pointed star lanterns specially made to welcome the Chinese Premier, illuminating the Chinese and Cambodian national flags hanging side by side. The Governor's banquet began at half past eight in the evening and did not end until eleven o'clock. The welcoming crowds had been waiting on both sides of the street. When Premier Zhou left this warm city, the night sky once again resounded with friendly cheers and thunderous applause.
    This is the deep friendship of the Cambodian people for the Chinese people. This friendship will forever remain in our memories. When Premier Zhou Enlai spoke at the dinner hosted by the Governor of Kampot Province, he repeatedly expressed his heartfelt thanks for the warm welcome of the Cambodian people. At the same time, Premier Zhou Enlai gave a high evaluation of the Cambodian people in that speech. He said: "What impressed me the most was seeing that all the Cambodian people are united around His Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk, with great discipline and order. Such people are strong, have strength, and are therefore invincible. Such people will surely defeat foreign aggression.” Premier Zhou also said: "This morning, we visited the textile factory in Kampong Cham. We saw new factories being built, and the workers and farmers there are very diligent. This proves that the Cambodian people have the strength to build their own country, they will surely be able to build Cambodia well, and Cambodia's plan for developing the national economy will surely be realized step by step!"
    Yes, the Cambodian people are diligent and brave. They are friendly to the Chinese people. May the people of the two countries work together, help each other, and learn from each other, to build their respective countries into even stronger nations. May the friendship between the Chinese and Cambodian peoples last forever!

    中柬友谊情深似海
    新华社记者　于民生　沈寿源
    当我们拿起笔来的时候，柬埔寨人民欢迎周恩来总理的动人场面一个一个生动地呈现在我们眼前。我们两国之间的友谊是如此深入人心，以致已经成了人民生活中不可缺少的一部分。这种友谊比山还高，比海还深。
    5月7日上午，周恩来总理到达柬埔寨第二大城市磅湛。这个城市只有两万多居民，但是从磅湛省各地来欢迎中国总理的人数超过四万。磅湛省省长对我们说，为了欢迎中国总理，当局宣布全省放假一天。有些人在前一天就从这个省的各地赶到磅湛，天亮以前就等在机场上和中国总理将要经过的道路两旁。当周恩来总理和西哈努克亲王从飞机上下来的时候，当他们乘车前往中国援助建设的磅湛纺织厂去参加开幕典礼的时候，成千上万的人民愉快地高呼“友谊”，并且兴高彩烈地欢呼万岁！
    周恩来总理在为工厂的开幕典礼剪彩后，同西哈努克亲王、福·波伦首相和陈毅副总理一起走进工厂去观看每一个车间。在宽敞的车间里，中国援助的现代化的纺织机闪闪发光。站在机器旁边的柬埔寨工人和中国专家都非常兴奋地等待这个友谊的时刻的到来。周恩来总理、西哈努克亲王、福·波伦首相和陈毅副总理走到机器旁边，轮流地按电钮使机器转动。这是有着深远意义的一个时刻，所有在场的人，都热烈地为这种友好的场面鼓掌。周恩来总理，西哈努克亲王，陈毅副总理在参观一周后稍事休息的时候，都愉快地拿起笔来在留言簿上写上颂扬两国友谊的题词。
    周恩来总理写道：“中柬两国人民永远友好，永远合作，互相帮助，互相学习。世界上工业上先进的国家所能做到的一切，我们两国的人民肯定也能做到。中柬友好万岁！柬埔寨王国万岁！西哈努克亲王殿下万岁！”
    这种情景激发了陈毅副总理的诗兴，他即席赋诗一首：“参观磅湛工厂，建筑美丽崭新。柬国人民创造，中柬友谊象征。亲王总理合作，两国永远相亲。”
    周恩来总理称赞陈毅副总理诗才敏捷，而西哈努克亲王几乎不能抑制他的爽朗的笑声。
    接着，西哈努克亲王挥笔表示友好的感情。他写道：“周恩来总理为之剪彩的磅湛纺织厂，现在是柬埔寨和中国友谊的最崇高的象征。中国对柬埔寨的无条件援助使它具备了建设国家的很好的条件。柬埔寨争取经济独立的愿望不久即将实现。这是中柬两国人民团结的象征。周恩来总理和陈毅副总理的访问将在柬埔寨的历史上和磅湛的历史上忠实地记录下来。柬中两国友好万岁！周恩来总理阁下万岁！陈毅副总理阁下万岁！愿柬中两国友谊万古长青！”
    当西哈努克亲王写完他的题词时，周恩来总理走上前去按住他的手说，“亲王殿下过奖了！”西哈努克回答说：“我说的是事实”。
    5月7日下午两点钟，周恩来总理来到了西哈努克亲王在柬埔寨南部沿海胜地白马的别墅。当周恩来总理的专机在离白马二十余公里的崩足卡机场着陆时，虽然炎日高照，甚至从海面上吹来的微风也热得炙人，但是，成千上万的人为了欢迎周恩来总理，已经在炎炎烈日下等了七、八个小时。在周恩来总理从机场前往在白马的别墅的路上，各个村镇都张贴着友好的标语，街上到处都展舞着中柬两国的国旗以及毛泽东、刘少奇、周恩来、朱德和陈毅的肖像。白发苍苍的老太太，拄着拐杖的老公公，热情洋溢的青年男女和三、四岁小孩都拥挤在道路的两旁。有些人很恭敬地举着贴在木牌上的中国领袖们的肖像；有些孩子舞动着中国的国旗，欢呼着友谊的口号；有的全家人都出来跪在道旁，双手合十，以表示对中国总理最诚挚的祝愿。
    当周总理离开白马前往龙波水库时，时已向晚，出乎我们意外的是，在水库上用棕榈树叶扎成的拱门周围聚集着数以千计的、从远近村庄前来欢迎周总理的人，他们为了见到总理，在那里从炎热的中午一直等到冷意袭人的黄昏。当群众看到周恩来总理终于出现时，热情顿时迸发。他们高兴地跳跃着，欢呼着，全都向周恩来总理拥来。当中国总理扳开水库的闸门，一股清水通过灌溉渠道流向田里时，人群中发出雷鸣般的掌声和欢呼声。这时人们想起了在水库开始建筑时，西哈努克亲王曾到建筑工地参加义务劳动的事！今天，在水库建成后不久，周恩来总理又在这里打开了水库的闸门，让清水流灌溉肥沃的土地。一位柬埔寨朋友谈到这件事的时候把西哈努克亲王和周恩来总理的名字联结在一起，他激动地说：“亲王和总理友好合作，两国人民欢欣愉快！”
    这已是伸手不见五指的夜间，但是王国人民的心里都燃烧着热情。在周恩来总理离开水库前往唝吥市参加唝吥省长为他举行的宴会的长达三十公里的公路两旁，热情的人民群众仍旧伫立在夜幕下欢迎周总理。
    在唝吥市，广大居民都出来欢迎周恩来总理。街道上人山人海，每家门口都挂着特别为欢迎中国总理而制作的五角星灯笼，映照着并排悬挂着的中柬两国国旗。省长的宴会在晚上八点半开始，直到十一点钟才结束。欢迎的群众一直在街道的两旁等待着。当周总理离开这个热情的城市时，夜空中又一次震荡起友好的欢呼声和雷鸣般的掌声。
    这就是柬埔寨人民对中国人民的深厚友谊。这种友谊将永远留在我们的记忆中。周恩来总理在唝吥省省长举行的晚宴上讲话的时候，曾一再对柬埔寨广大人民的热烈欢迎表示衷心的感谢，同时，周恩来总理在那次讲话中对柬埔寨人民给了很高的评价。他说：“给我印象最深的，就是看到全体柬埔寨人民都团结在西哈努克亲王殿下的周围，很有纪律，很有秩序。这样的人民是强大的，是有力量的，因而也是不可战胜的，这样的人民一定会战胜外来的侵犯。周总理又说：“今天上午，我们在磅湛参观了纺织厂。我们看到新的工厂建设起来了，那里的工人和农民都很勤劳。这证明了柬埔寨人民是有力量建设自己的国家的，他们一定能够把柬埔寨建设好，柬埔寨发展国民经济的计划一定能一步一步地实现！”
    是的，柬埔寨人民是勤劳和勇敢的。他们对中国人民是友好的。愿两国人民携手前进，彼此帮助彼此学习，把他们各自的国家建设成为更强大的国家。愿中国—柬埔寨两国人民的友谊万古长青！
