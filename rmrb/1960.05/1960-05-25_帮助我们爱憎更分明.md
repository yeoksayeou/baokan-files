    Helping Us to Love and Hate More Clearly

    After watching the film "Hero Island," I was very emotionally stirred. What deserves mentioning is the poetic narration in the film, which makes the entire film full of vividness and vitality. For example, when an American general from Taiwan arrives on the enemy island, the narration explains, "Here, there is no welcoming band, no flower-presenting girls, only a few military police standing like sticks on both sides." It also says, "The dregs of humanity, the garbage of life, are all gathered here today." "Look at this snake-like shadow, listen to this devilish laughter." These concise narrations not only expose the ugly face of the invaders but also portray the enemy's lonely and embarrassed inner state. In starkly contrasting scenes, the film also uses narration to enthusiastically praise the heroic Lotus Flower Island: "Here, it is not the cities of the rear, but the underground streets of Lotus Flower Island. Although the island surface is filled with artillery fire, everything here is still in good order."

    Because of the narration's vivid and powerful depiction, the audience hates the enemy even more and loves our great motherland even more. The entire film also figuratively tells us a truth, as the narration says: ... We believe that the enemy will surely rot away day by day, while our heroic Lotus Flower Island and our great motherland will get better and better day by day.

    帮助我们爱憎更分明

    看完影片“英雄岛”后，感情很激动，值得谈谈的是影片中诗一般的旁白，使得整个影片充满生动、活泼的气氛。例如：当敌岛上从台湾来了一位美国将军时，旁白解说，“这里既没有欢迎的乐队，也没有献花的女郎，只有几个宪兵像棍子一样戳在两边。”又说：“人类的渣滓，生活中的垃圾，今天都麕集在这里。”“看这蛇一样的阴影，听这魔鬼般的笑声”，这些简洁的旁白，既揭露了侵略者的丑恶面目，又刻划了敌人孤独狼狈的内心状态。在鲜明对照的镜头里，影片对英雄的荷花岛也利用旁白作了热情的歌颂，“这里，不是后方的城市，而是荷花岛的地下街道，虽然岛面上炮火连天，这里却依然井井有条。”
    由于旁白鲜明有力的描绘，使观众对敌人更加憎恨，对我们伟大的祖国更加热爱。整个影片也形象地告诉了我们一条真理，正如旁白所说的：……我们相信，敌人一定会一天天地烂下去，而我们英雄的荷花岛和我们伟大的祖国在一起，一定会一天天地好起来。
