Esteemed Prince Norodom Sihanouk,
Esteemed Deputy Prime Minister Nhiek Tioulong,
Respected Friends:

　　Today, we feel very honored and happy to be able to personally attend the opening ceremony of the Kampong Cham Textile Factory. The completion of the Kampong Cham Textile Factory is a joyous event for the Cambodian people. On behalf of Vice Premier Chen Yi and myself, I extend warm congratulations to you.

　　The completion of the Kampong Cham Textile Factory not only demonstrates the determination of the Cambodian people, under the leadership of Prince Sihanouk, to develop their own national industry, but also shows that the Cambodian people have the ability to develop their own national industry. In the past, both China and Cambodia suffered from colonial oppression and plunder for a long time, and both were economically poor and backward. It is not an easy task for us to eliminate the disasters caused by colonialism in a not-too-long period of time, establish our own national industry, and enable us to join the ranks of advanced countries. However, as long as we are determined, rely on our own diligent hands, and rely on the mutual assistance and cooperation of friendly countries, we will definitely be able to build our countries step by step. What Western countries can do, we Asian and African countries can certainly do.

　　Just now, His Excellency Deputy Prime Minister Nhiek Tioulong praised China's assistance to Cambodia in his speech, which we dare not accept. China has not yet completely gotten rid of its economic backwardness. Our assistance to Cambodia is still extremely limited. It only shows the Chinese people's goodwill towards the Cambodian people. The completion of the Kampong Cham Textile Factory mainly relies on the efforts of the Cambodian people themselves. During our visit in the past two days, we have seen that the Cambodian people have vigorous labor enthusiasm and have quickly mastered production technology. We are sincerely delighted to see that your experts and technicians are growing rapidly. We sincerely wish the Cambodian people greater and greater achievements in the cause of building their motherland under the leadership of Prince Sihanouk.

　　Long live the hardworking Cambodian people!
　　Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Cambodian people!
　　Long live His Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk!

### 周总理在皇家纺织厂开幕式上的讲话

    周总理在皇家纺织厂开幕式上的讲话尊敬的西哈努克亲王殿下，尊敬的刁隆副首相阁下，尊敬的朋友们：
    今天我们能够亲自参加磅湛纺织厂的开幕典礼，感到非常荣幸和高兴。磅湛纺织厂的建成是柬埔寨人民的一件喜事。我以陈毅副总理和我个人的名义向你们表示热烈的祝贺。
    磅湛纺织厂的建成，不仅说明柬埔寨人民在西哈努克亲王的领导下，有发展自己民族工业的决心，而且也说明了柬埔寨人民有发展自己民族工业的能力。我们中柬两国过去都长期遭受殖民主义的压迫和掠夺，经济上都比较贫困和落后，我们要在一个不太长的时间内清除殖民主义所造成的灾难，建立起自己的民族工业，使我们走进先进国家的行列，不是一件轻而易举的事，但是，只要我们有决心，依靠我们自己勤劳的双手，依靠友好国家的互助合作，我们一定能够一步一步地把我们的国家建设起来，西方国家能够做到的事，我们亚非国家也一定能够做到。
    刚才刁隆副首相阁下在讲话中赞扬了中国对于柬埔寨的帮助，这使我们不敢当，中国现在还没有完全摆脱经济上的落后状况，我们对柬埔寨的帮助还是极其有限的，它只是表明了中国人民对于柬埔寨人民的一点心意。磅湛纺织厂的建成主要是依靠柬埔寨人民自己的努力。我们在这两天的参观中，看到柬埔寨人民有着旺盛的劳动热情，并且很快的掌握了生产技术，我们看到你们的专家和技术人员正在迅速的成长起来，感到由衷的喜悦。我们真诚的祝愿柬埔寨人民在西哈努克亲王的领导下，在建设自己祖国的事业中取得越来越大的成就。
    勤劳的柬埔寨人民万岁！
    中柬两国人民的友谊万岁！
    西哈努克亲王殿下万岁！
