    Increase Production of High-Quality Paper

    Where should the cutting edge of the current technological innovation and technological revolution movement in the paper industry be directed? The answer is: improve paper quality, increase the production of high-quality paper, and achieve an all-round leap forward in paper production!

    The overall trend of paper quality in our country is getting better day by day. However, some enterprises have improved paper quality very quickly, while others have improved relatively slowly. Some enterprises' letterpress paper, offset paper, newsprint, and other cultural papers still have defects such as being dark, thick, and coarse. Although this is only a minor issue in the Great Leap Forward, it is a major matter that cannot be ignored. Paper industry enterprises must focus their technological innovation and technological revolution on quality issues, take effective measures to eliminate bad paper, and produce more good paper.

    Some people say: "As long as you give me enough good raw materials, I can produce high-quality paper." This statement is only partially true. Indeed, the quality of raw materials is an important factor determining product quality. But, can we say that with good raw materials, we can definitely produce good products? Not entirely. The paper industry has such situations: different enterprises with roughly the same equipment conditions, although using the same raw materials, have different product quality, some being superior and others inferior. Some enterprises even use better raw materials than others, but their product quality is worse. This illustrates a truth: what determines product quality, in addition to material and technical conditions, is also the subjective initiative of people. We must not only see the role of pulp, caustic soda, bleaching agents, etc., but also ignore the subjective efforts of people. To eliminate bad paper, the first step is to carry out ideological revolution, fully utilize people's subjective initiative, and, on the basis of ideological revolution, vigorously carry out technological revolution, strive to learn and promote advanced experiences, improve technical levels, improve operations, and strengthen management, thereby fully utilizing the material and technical role of existing raw materials and equipment. We will not only use good raw materials to produce excellent paper, but also try our best to use inferior raw materials and even various substitutes to produce good paper. We must also practice strict economy, oppose waste, and, while ensuring product quality, vigorously reduce the consumption of raw materials, striving to produce more and better paper with the same amount of raw materials.

    "What should we do if the supply of raw materials such as pulp, caustic soda, and bleaching agents cannot meet the needs of production?" This is indeed a problem. However, solving this problem is not too difficult. There is only one way out: self-reliance and diversified operations. This is an effective method that works on all fronts. If you don't believe it, please look at the examples of the Minfeng and Huafeng paper mills in Zhejiang Province. Since 1958, due to the great development of production, the supply of caustic soda and bleaching powder has been far from meeting the needs of production in these two factories. At that time, they were also in a passive state of "wanting everything but having nothing." However, because they resolutely implemented the policy of self-reliance and diversified operations, using indigenous methods, and running their own electrolytic salt factories, they can now basically produce the caustic soda and bleaching powder needed for paper production themselves. The paper quality of these two factories is very good, and their output is constantly increasing. "Wanting everything but having nothing" has become "having everything they want," and passivity has become initiative. The material and technical conditions of the Minfeng and Huafeng factories are not better than those of other modern paper mills. They can be self-reliant, implement diversified operations, run their own raw material factories, and produce high-quality paper. Of course, other factories can follow suit, and even do better. What is needed here is great revolutionary drive and a spirit of self-reliance. Every paper enterprise must regard the production of raw materials as its own task, strive for progress, produce whatever is lacking, and produce whatever is needed, instead of blindly relying on others and being a hand-raiser. To focus the cutting edge of technological innovation and technological revolution on improving paper quality means that every enterprise must, according to production needs, rely on the masses, use indigenous methods, and vigorously launch alkali, chlorine (bleaching agent), and pulp movements to quickly get raw material production up and running. This is the second effective measure to ensure the production of more high-quality paper. This measure is not a temporary or reluctant measure, but the direction of socialist enterprise development and a specific policy for implementing the general line. We must do this now, and we must do this in the future. "The early bird catches the worm," whoever does this earlier and more resolutely will gain the initiative earlier.

    We ask paper enterprises to focus the cutting edge of technological innovation and technological revolution on paper quality and strive to produce high-quality paper, of course, not to say that the growth of output can be ignored. On the contrary, due to the rapid development of cultural and educational undertakings in our country, increasing the quantity of paper is also an important goal for paper industry workers. We should not at any time put the improvement of product quality and the increase in quantity in opposition to each other, neither neglecting quality for the sake of increasing output, nor neglecting the increase in output when improving quality. Every enterprise must complete and over fulfill the state plan according to quality, quantity, and on schedule. If the quantity is insufficient, it must be produced in full; if the quality is not up to standard, it must not be released from the factory, and if it has left the factory due to lax inspection, it should be returned or replaced. In short, our slogan is: more, faster, better, and more economical, increase the production of high-quality paper.

    增产优质纸
    当前造纸工业技术革新、技术革命运动的锋芒，应当指向哪里？回答是：提高纸张质量，增产优质纸，实现纸张生产的全面跃进！
    我国的纸张质量，总的趋势是一天比一天好。但是，有些企业的纸张质量提高得很快，而另一些企业却提高得比较慢，有的企业生产的凸板纸、胶版纸、新闻纸等文化纸，仍然存在着黑、厚、粗的缺点。这虽然只不过是大跃进中的一个指头，但却是忽视不得的大事情。造纸工业企业必须把技术革新、技术革命的锋芒对准质量问题，采取有效措施，革掉坏纸的命，多生产好纸。
    有人说：只要给我足够的好原料，就能生产出优质纸张来。这句话只有一方面的道理。不错，原料的好坏，确实是决定产品质量的一个重要因素。但是，能不能说，有了好的原料，就一定能生产出好的产品来呢？不能完全这样说。造纸工业就有这样的情形：设备条件大致相同的不同企业，虽然用的原料材料相同，但是产品质量却有优劣高低之别。甚至有的企业用的原料材料比人家的好，而产品质量却比人家的差。这说明一个真理：决定产品质量的，除了物质技术条件以外，还有人的主观能动作用。我们决不能只看到纸浆、烧碱、漂白剂等的作用，而忽视人的主观努力。我们要革坏纸的命，第一条就是要进行思想革命，充分发挥人的主观能动作用，在思想革命的基础上大搞技术革命，努力学习和推广先进经验，提高技术水平，改进操作，加强管理，从而充分发挥现有原料、设备等物质技术的作用。我们不但做到用好的原料生产出优等的纸张来，而且要千方百计地用次等的原料以至各种代用原料来生产出好的纸张来。我们还要厉行节约，反对浪费，在保证产品质量的条件下，大力降低原料、材料的消耗量，力求用同样多的原料、材料，生产更多更好的纸张。
    “纸浆、烧碱、漂白剂等原料的供应满足不了生产的需要，怎么办呢？”这确实是一个问题。但是，要解决这个问题并不太困难。出路只有一条，就是自力更生，实行多种经营。这是各个战线上行之有效的好办法。谁不相信，就请看浙江省民丰、华丰两个造纸厂的例子。这两个工厂从1958年起，由于生产的大发展，烧碱和漂白粉的供应远不能满足生产的需要。他们当时也一度是“要啥没啥”，被动得很。但是，由于他们坚决地贯彻执行自力更生、多种经营的方针，土法上马，自办电解食盐厂，现在，生产纸张需要的烧碱和漂白粉基本上可以自给了。这两个厂的纸张质量很好，产量又不断增加。“要啥没啥”变成了“要啥有啥”，被动变成了主动。民丰、华丰两个厂的物质技术条件，并不比别的现代化造纸厂的好。他们能够自力更生，实行多种经营，自办原料工厂，并且生产出质量很好的纸来，别的工厂当然都可以仿照办理，甚至可以做得更好。在这里，需要有很大的革命干劲和自力更生精神。每一个造纸企业都要把原料的生产看做自己的任务，发奋图强，缺什么生产什么，需要什么生产什么，而不要一味依赖他人，做伸手派。要把技术革新和技术革命的锋芒对准提高纸张质量，就是要求每个企业都要根据生产的需要，依靠群众，土法上马，大搞碱、氯（漂白剂）、浆运动，迅速把原料生产搞起来。这就是保证多生产优质纸的第二条有效措施。这个措施，并不是临时的或不得已而为之的措施，而是社会主义企业发展的方向，是贯彻执行总路线的一个具体方针。现在要这样办，将来也必须这样办。“先下手为强”，谁越早越坚决这样办，谁就越早争得主动。
    我们要求造纸企业把技术革新、技术革命的锋芒对准纸张质量，为生产优质纸而奋斗，当然不是说，可以忽视产量的增长。恰恰相反，由于我国文化教育事业的飞速发展，增加纸张数量，同样也是造纸工业职工的一个重要的奋斗目标。我们不论在什么时候，都不应当把提高产品质量和增加数量对立起来，既不能为了增加产量而忽视质量，也不能在提高质量的时候而忽视产量的增加。每一个企业都要按质、按量、按期地完成和超额完成国家计划。数量不足的，要生产足；质量不合格的，不让出厂，由于检验不严而出了厂的，应该包退包换。总之，我们的口号是：多快好省，增产优质纸。
