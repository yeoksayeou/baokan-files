Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, 4th: According to TASS, the Soviet representative, Zorin, presented a statement from the Soviet government on May 3rd at the Soviet, American, and British conference on the cessation of nuclear weapons testing, regarding the joint communiqué issued by U.S. President Eisenhower and British Prime Minister Macmillan on March 29th, demanding an agreement be reached now on temporarily suspending underground nuclear tests.

    The statement said: "The Soviet government believes that the effective duration of a temporary suspension of underground nuclear tests is of great significance, because the fate of the entire agreement on the cessation of nuclear tests currently depends, to a large extent, on this issue." However, "The statement issued by the U.S. President and the British Prime Minister on March 29th this year made no mention of the duration of the temporary suspension of tests. The Soviet government expects the United States and the United Kingdom to provide a clear response to this issue in the near future."

    The Soviet statement pointed out that the American and British representatives at the meeting had indicated that the issue of temporarily suspending small-scale underground nuclear tests was closely related to the duration of the research program for improving the monitoring system. Considering this, the Soviet side had suggested specifying the duration of the temporary suspension of underground nuclear tests as four to five years. In any case, the duration of the temporary suspension of tests should not be less than the duration used to implement the joint research program.

    The statement said: "In order to seek an agreement, the Soviet government accepts the suggestion of the United States and the United Kingdom that the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom each issue separate statements, announcing the duration of the temporary suspension of tests."

    Speaking at the meeting, Zorin emphasized that the Soviet Union believes that reaching an agreement on the temporary suspension of tests is of particular significance; and believes that this agreement must be reached now, before the signing of the treaty. This agreement should be of a firm nature. The Soviet Union insists on its suggestion that, after the expiration of the temporary suspension of tests, the parties should not be automatically released from the obligation to temporarily suspend tests.

    Zorin said that the temporary cessation of nuclear explosions will be stipulated during the implementation of the joint research program. The implementation of this program may produce two situations: one situation is that an agreement is reached on measures to increase the effectiveness of monitoring small-scale underground nuclear explosions, at which time the issue of temporarily suspending tests will disappear on its own, because the unconditional prohibition of all underground nuclear explosions will be included in the treaty on the cessation of nuclear weapons tests. However, if, within the agreed period for the temporary suspension of tests, the joint research has not reached a consensus on measures to increase the effectiveness of monitoring small-scale underground nuclear tests, another situation may arise. In the latter case, this situation should be the object of discussion between the countries concerned, and should not lead to the automatic release of the obligation to temporarily suspend tests and the resumption of underground nuclear weapons tests.

    Zorin said that the Soviet Union agrees to the U.S. proposal that experts from the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom begin holding meetings on May 11, 1960 to formulate a plan for jointly studying the improvement of the monitoring system. He said that the Soviet Union believes that the research and experiments conducted to improve the monitoring system for underground nuclear explosions, as well as the organization of all materials derived from such experiments, should be jointly implemented by the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom according to a unified plan, rather than separately. He pointed out that conducting research jointly according to a unified joint plan is the most effective, and can avoid the difficulties of prolonged disputes over the judgment of materials that may be encountered in separate research.

### 就艾森豪威尔和麦克米伦的联合公报  苏联政府发表声明  要求现在就暂停地下核试验达成协议

    就艾森豪威尔和麦克米伦的联合公报
    苏联政府发表声明
    要求现在就暂停地下核试验达成协议
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦讯：苏联代表查拉普金3日在苏、美、英三国不继续核武器试验会议上，提出了苏联政府关于美国总统艾森豪威尔和英国首相麦克米伦3月29日发表的联合公报的一份声明，要求现在就暂时停止地下核试验达成协议。
    声明说：“苏联政府认为暂时停止地下核试验的有效期限具有很大的意义，因为关于停止核试验的整个协议的命运目前在很大的程度上取决于这个问题。”但是，“美国总统和英国首相在今年3月29日发表的声明中一点也没有提到有关暂时停止试验的期限。苏联政府期待美国和英国在不久的将来会对这个问题作出明确的答复。”
    苏联声明指出，美国和英国代表在会上曾经表示，暂时停止小型地下核试验的问题同改进监督系统的研究计划的期限是密切联系在一起的。出于这种考虑，苏联方面曾建议，把暂时停止地下核试验的期限规定为四—五年。无论如何，暂时停止试验的期限不应当少于用来实现联合研究计划的期限。
    声明说：“为谋求达成协议，苏联政府接受美国和英国的建议，即苏、美、英三国各自单独发表声明，宣布暂时停止试验的期限。”
    查拉普金在会议上发言时强调指出，苏联认为就暂时停止试验的问题达成协议具有特别重大的意义；并认为，必须在现在，即在签订条约之前达成这种协议。这一协议应当具有稳固的性质。苏联坚持建议，在暂时停止试验的期限过后，各方不应自动解除暂时停止试验的义务。
    查拉普金说，在执行联合研究计划期间将规定暂时停止核爆炸。实现这个计划可能产生两种情况：一种情况是就增加监督小型地下核爆炸的有效性的措施达成协议，那时，暂时停止试验的问题将自行消失，因为在停止核武器试验条约中将列入无条件禁止一切地下核爆炸的条款。但是，如果在暂时停止试验的商定期限内，联合研究还没有就增加监督小型地下核试验的有效性的一致同意的措施达成协议，这时可能产生另一种情况。在后一种情况下，这种情况应当成为有关国家之间讨论的对象，而不应当导致自动解除暂时停止试验的义务和恢复地下核武器试验。
    查拉普金说，苏联同意美国所提出的苏、美、英三国专家在1960年5月11日开始举行会议以制定联合研究改进监督系统的计划。他说，苏联认为，为改进对地下核爆炸的监督系统而进行的研究和试验，以及对这种试验所得出的全部材料的整理，都应当根据统一的计划由苏、美、英三国共同实现，而不是单独进行。他指出，根据统一的联合计划共同进行研究是最有效的，并且可以避免分别研究时可能遇到的在材料判断上引起长时间争论的困难。
