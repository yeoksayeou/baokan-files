Xinhua News Agency, 6th dispatch: British and West German bourgeois propaganda machines are lavishly praising Nehru's attacks on China and viciously provoking Sino-Indian relations.

The British bourgeois mouthpiece, *The Economist*, in its April 30th commentary, expressed relief at the attitude taken by Nehru in the Sino-Indian Prime Ministers' meeting, believing that Premier Zhou Enlai had "learned a lesson" in Delhi. It also expressed satisfaction with Nehru's remarks attacking China at the Delhi airport. It said that there was "no reason" to worry that the Sino-Indian Prime Ministers' meeting might reach some kind of agreement. It said that Premier Zhou Enlai "had hardly taken off for Kathmandu before Prime Minister Nehru rushed to explain." Regarding the provision in the Sino-Indian joint communiqué for officials of the two countries to continue talks, the publication happily pointed out, "Nehru has made it clear that he has little hope for the smooth progress of the negotiations."

The British Broadcasting Corporation, in a commentary the day after the conclusion of the Sino-Indian Prime Ministers' meeting, said: "Nehru adopted a tough approach from beginning to end. In the six days of talks, he did not yield an inch." The commentary particularly expressed satisfaction with Nehru's following approach: when Premier Zhou arrived in New Delhi, he issued "a cold statement, putting all the responsibility for the current situation on China," and when Premier Zhou left New Delhi, he immediately issued a statement saying "the tension [between China and India] still exists." The broadcasting company said, "Nehru has no intention of negotiating," and "Nehru has closed the door."

The British *New Statesman* on May 7th praised Nehru for "displaying exemplary firmness" in the Sino-Indian Prime Ministers' meeting. It advised those Indian parliamentarians who are "so ignorant of the situation" not to accuse Nehru of "cowardice" in the Indian Parliament.

An article in the April 30th issue of the same publication also viciously provoked relations between China and its neighbors such as India, Burma, and Nepal, frightening China's neighbors with the myth of so-called "China now has an expansionist sentiment." It also wants India to "recognize" the significance of prolonging the Sino-Indian border issue for a long time, as Nehru said, for "ten to forty years." *The Guardian* also praised Nehru for "not giving in at all" in its April 27th editorial. It also published an article on May 3rd, urging Nehru to take a "firm" attitude. It said that the moment to really believe in Nehru has not yet arrived, "unless he (Nehru) is careful, otherwise his prestige will fall like the tail of a comet." The West German bourgeois newspaper *Frankfurter Rundschau* also praised Nehru's position as being "much firmer than originally expected."

*Neue Rheinische Zeitung* provoked by saying that "the psychological impact" of Nehru's attitude "on anti-communist countries in Asia" "must not be underestimated."

    英国西德宣传机器挑拨中印关系
    对尼赫鲁攻击中国大加赞赏
    新华社6日讯　英国和西德的资产阶级宣传机器对尼赫鲁攻击中国备加赞扬，并恶毒挑拨中印关系。
    英国资产阶级喉舌“经济学家”4月30日的评论中对尼赫鲁在中印总理会谈中所采取的态度表示宽慰，认为周恩来总理在德里“上了一课”。他并且对尼赫鲁在德里机场上攻击中国的谈话表示满意。它说，担心中印总理会谈可能会达成某种协议“是没有理由的”。它说，周恩来总理“几乎还没有起飞前往加德满都，尼赫鲁总理就急忙地进行了解释”。对于中印联合公报中规定两国官员继续会谈，这家刊物满意地指出，“尼赫鲁已经说明，他对谈判顺利进行抱的希望很小”。
    英国广播公司在中印总理会谈结束的第二天发表评论说：“尼赫鲁自始至终都采取了强硬的方针，在六天的会谈中，他没有作寸步的退让。”评论特别对尼赫鲁下面的这种做法表示满意：当周总理到达新德里时他发表了“一篇冷冰冰的声明，把造成目前局势的责任统统推在中国头上”，而当周总理离开新德里以后，他立即发表声明说“（中印之间）紧张关系仍然存在”。这家广播公司说，“尼赫鲁无意谈判”，“尼赫鲁把这个门路关死了”。
    英国的“新政治家”5月7日称赞尼赫鲁在中印总理会谈中“表现了典范的坚定”，它劝告那些“对于局势竟然如此无知”的印度议员们，不该在印度议会上指责尼赫鲁“懦弱”。
    这家刊物4月30日的一期上刊载的一篇文章还恶毒挑拨中国同印度、缅甸、尼泊尔等邻国的关系，用所谓“中国现在有一种扩张主义情绪”的神话恫吓中国的邻国。它还要印度“认识到”把中印边界问题长时间拖延不决的意义，像尼赫鲁所说的那样，拖上“十年到四十年”。“卫报”在4月27日的社论中也赞扬尼赫鲁“一点也没有退让”。它在5月3日还刊载了一篇文章，要尼赫鲁采取“坚定”的态度。它说，当真相信尼赫鲁的时刻还没有来到，“除非他（尼赫鲁）当心点，要不然他的威信将和彗星尾巴一样地坠落下来”。西德资产阶级报纸“法兰克福评论报”也赞扬尼赫鲁的立场比原来预料的“更加坚定得多”。
    “新来因报”挑拨说，“决不能低估”尼赫鲁采取的态度“对亚洲反共国家的心理影响”。
