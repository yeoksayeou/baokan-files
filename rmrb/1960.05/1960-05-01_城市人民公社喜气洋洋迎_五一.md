Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 30th: On the eve of "May Day," the Shangxin Street People's Commune in Chongqing, which has achieved remarkable success in organizing the people's economic life, presents a joyful festive scene.

　　In the evening, commune members who had finished a day's work, brought their families, young and old, to the commune's stadium to participate in the garden party. Among them were workers from commune-run factories, well-known innovation experts, and outstanding nursery workers, cooks, and service personnel. The commune stadium, which served as the venue, was decorated with flowers, red flags fluttering everywhere, and brightly lit. Commune members celebrated the establishment of the People's Commune and the "May Day" International Labor Day with joy and excitement. There were singing competitions, fascinating acrobatics, and lion and dragon dances full of ethnic flavor. Everywhere, the audience was packed, and cheers thundered. More than a dozen female workers in their forties and fifties from the asbestos workshop of the "March 8th Comprehensive Factory," a commune-run factory, sang tunes such as "The People's Commune is really good, liberating women from household chores, spinning thousands of yards of asbestos, supporting the steel commander to ascend to the tent" and "Old ladies, all join the battle, wholeheartedly engage in innovation," which were warmly welcomed by the masses. One of the performers, Liang Zelin, is a mother of five. In previous "May Day" celebrations, only her eldest daughter and husband participated in the celebrations, while she had to stay at home to take care of the children and cook. Now, the nurseries, canteens, and service personnel share many of her housework responsibilities, allowing her to participate in work without any worries.
