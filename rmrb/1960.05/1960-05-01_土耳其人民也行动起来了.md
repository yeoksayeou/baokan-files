The Turkish People Also Take Action
Commentator of This Newspaper

The storm of South Korean people opposing the US-Syngman Rhee clique is in full swing, and in Turkey, another country at the western end of Asia, a large-scale anti-government struggle has also erupted. Following the massive demonstration by tens of thousands of students in Istanbul, student demonstrations have broken out continuously in the Turkish capital Ankara and the major western city of Izmir, opposing the dictatorial rule of the American puppet Menderes, demanding democracy and freedom, and demanding Menderes' resignation. Just as in South Korea, the American-backed Menderes reactionaries brutally used violence against the peacefully demonstrating masses, carrying out bloody suppression and causing serious casualties. The Chinese people express infinite sympathy for the just struggle of the Turkish people under the oppression of the United States and its lackeys, express extreme indignation at the bloody massacre by the US-Turkish reactionaries, and express strong protest.

South Korea and Turkey have always been regarded by the United States as its two most loyal "allies." South Korea has been called a "democratic showcase" of the "free world," while Turkey was once called a democratic "experimental field" by Eisenhower; Syngman Rhee was painted with the rouge of a "great patriot," and Menderes was also given the "good name" of a "freedom fighter." Now, in the words of the British newspapers, the "democratic showcase" has become a pile of broken glass, and the "great patriot" has proven to be a traitor abandoned by all; and that democratic "experimental field" has also become a slaughterhouse, and the "freedom fighter" is cursed by the people as a dictator. In this way, the so-called "democracy" and "freedom" lies that the United States has always boasted about have completely gone bankrupt. More importantly, the situations in South Korea and Turkey show that the United States' means of recruiting national scum in Asia and Latin America to enslave the people of various countries can no longer conceal its aggressive face. The South Korean people have risen up, and the Turkish people have risen up. The "free world" is full of volcanoes ready to erupt. The days of the American aggressors are getting worse and worse.

The situations in Turkey and South Korea seem like coincidences, but they are not. The United States has adopted the same enslavement policy towards South Korea and Turkey, and the same consequences will naturally occur. At the same time, as the struggle of the Turkish people shows, they have been encouraged by the heroic struggle and victory of the South Korean people. And the struggles of the South Korean and Turkish people will undoubtedly continue to inspire all other people oppressed by US imperialism and its lackeys, so that they will bravely rise up to fight for independence, democracy and freedom. No wonder US Senator Dorn worriedly said: "We are starting to lose track of who will be next." It is absolutely impossible for the United States to stop this tide like a spring flood. The heinous American imperialism will inevitably fall into a state of siege on all sides.

    土耳其人民也行动起来了
    本报评论员
    南朝鲜人民反对美李集团的风暴方兴未艾，在亚洲西端的另一个国家土耳其又爆发了大规模的反政府的斗争。继伊斯坦布尔成万学生举行大示威后，土耳其首都安卡拉和西部主要城市伊兹密尔都连续爆发了学生示威，反对美国傀儡曼德列斯的独裁统治，要求民主自由，要求曼德列斯下台。也像在南朝鲜所发生的情况一样，美国豢养的曼德列斯反动派野蛮地用暴力对付和平示威的人民群众，进行了血腥的镇压，造成严重的伤亡。中国人民对于在美国及其走狗压迫下土耳其人民的正义斗争无限同情，对于美土反动派的血腥屠杀无比愤怒，并表示强烈的抗议。
    南朝鲜和土耳其一向是被美国认为是它的两个最忠实的“盟国”的。南朝鲜被称作是“自由世界”的“民主橱窗”，土耳其则曾被艾森豪威尔称为民主的“试验场”；李承晚被搽上“伟大的爱国者”的脂粉，曼德列斯也被赠予“自由战士”的“美名”。现在，用英国报纸的话来说，“民主橱窗”已经成为一堆碎玻璃，“伟大的爱国者”证明是一个人所共弃的卖国贼；而那个民主“试验场”也变成了屠场，“自由战士”被人民唾骂为独裁者。这样，美国所一向吹嘘的所谓“民主”、“自由”的鬼话就完全破产了。更重要的是南朝鲜和土耳其的局势表明，美国在亚洲和拉丁美洲收罗民族败类来奴役各国人民的手段，再也掩盖不了它的侵略面目。南朝鲜人民起来了，土耳其人民起来了，“自由世界”到处是一触即发的火山。美国侵略者的日子是越来越不好过了。
    土耳其和南朝鲜的情况像是偶合，其实并不是偶合。美国对南朝鲜和土耳其采取了同样的奴役政策，自然会发生同样的后果。同时，正如土耳其人民的斗争所表明的，他们受到了南朝鲜人民的英勇斗争和胜利所鼓舞。而南朝鲜人民和土耳其人民的斗争，无疑的将会继续激励其他一切在美帝国主义及其走狗压迫下的人民，使他们勇敢地起来为争取独立、民主和自由而斗争。难怪美国议员多恩忧心忡忡地说：“我们开始搞不清楚下一个该轮到谁了。”美国要想阻止这股像春汛一般的浪潮，是绝对办不到的。万恶的美帝国主义必将陷于四面楚歌之中。
