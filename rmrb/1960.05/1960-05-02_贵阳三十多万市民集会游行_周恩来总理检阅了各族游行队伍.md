Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, May 1st. This year's International Labor Day, "May Day," was celebrated with extraordinary joy and enthusiasm by the people of Guiyang. Zhou Enlai, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Premier of the State Council, arrived in Guiyang yesterday from Kunming and spent the holiday with the working people of Guiyang today.

Today, over 300,000 citizens of Guiyang rallied and paraded to celebrate "May Day." From early morning, the entire city was in a state of excitement, with red flags flying everywhere and the sounds of gongs and drums filling the air, creating a festive and joyful atmosphere. Celebration rallies and parades were held in more than twenty venues.

At 9:50 AM, Premier Zhou Enlai, Comrade Deng Yingchao, and Zhou Lin, First Secretary of the Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and other leading comrades stepped onto the rostrum of the central venue - Nan Chang Square. At this time, the square was filled with colorful banners and flying colorful balloons and flowers. More than 60,000 workers, peasants, students, and citizens participating in the rally here burst into thunderous applause.

At 10:00 AM, Wu Jiamo, First Secretary of the Guiyang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, announced the start of the celebration rally. He said excitedly: "Premier Zhou Enlai is spending the holiday with us, giving us tremendous encouragement. We express our warmest welcome with the most sincere feelings." At this moment, the entire venue resounded with thunderous applause once again.

The grand review parade began. Leading the way was an honor guard composed of 1,500 outstanding workers from Guiyang's industrial and transportation front, who were full of energy and marched in neat steps. Following them, the Young Pioneers, waving colorful balloons and flowers, skipped and cheered as they approached the rostrum. Several Young Pioneers ran up to the rostrum and presented flowers to Premier Zhou Enlai. Subsequently, the mighty worker contingent arrived in front of the rostrum to report to Premier Zhou Enlai and the provincial and municipal party and government leaders on the great achievements made by Guiyang's industrial front. Next, the enthusiastic student contingent arrived in front of the rostrum. When Premier Zhou saw the students of Guizhou Normal College carrying a model of the newly compiled "History of Guizhou," he asked loudly: "Comrades, has the History of Guizhou been compiled?" The students answered in unison: "It has been compiled, and we will continue to work hard."

After the literary and artistic contingent, while walking, performed Guizhou local and ethnic dances as they passed through the rostrum, tens of thousands of Young Pioneers, waving flowers and colorful balloons, surged towards the rostrum.

    贵阳三十多万市民集会游行
    周恩来总理检阅了各族游行队伍
    据新华社贵阳1日电　今年的“五一”国际劳动节，贵阳市人民过得特别欢腾而热烈。中共中央副主席、国务院总理周恩来昨天从昆明来到贵阳，今天同贵阳市的劳动人民共度佳节。
    今天，贵阳有三十多万市民集会游行欢庆“五一”节。从清晨起，全城就沸腾起来，到处红旗飘扬，锣鼓喧天，一片节日的欢乐景象。庆祝集会和游行分别在二十多个场所举行。
    上午九时五十分，周恩来总理、邓颖超同志和中共贵州省委第一书记周林等领导同志一起步上中心会场——南厂广场的主席台。这时候，广场上锦旗招展，彩球、鲜花飞舞。在这里参加大会的六万多工人、农民、学生和市民，掌声雷动。
    十时整，中共贵阳市委第一书记伍嘉谟宣布庆祝大会开始。他兴奋地说：“周恩来总理同我们共度佳节，给我们以极大的鼓舞，我们以最诚挚的心情表示最热烈的欢迎。”这时，全场又一次响起雷鸣般的掌声。
    盛大的检阅游行开始了。走在最前边的是贵阳市工业交通战线一千五百名优秀工人组成的仪仗队，他们精神抖擞，步伐整齐。接着，少先队员的队伍挥舞着彩球鲜花，跳跃着、欢呼着，来到主席台前。几个少先队员跑上主席台，把鲜花献给周恩来总理。随后，浩浩荡荡的工人队伍来到主席台前，向周恩来总理和省市党政领导人汇报贵阳市工业战线取得的伟大成就。接着，热情洋溢的学生队伍来到了主席台前。周总理看到贵州师范学院学生抬着新编写的“贵州史”模型，高声问道：“同学们，贵州史编好了没有？”同学们齐声答道：“编好了，我们还要继续努力。”
    在文艺大军一边走，一边表演着贵州地方、民族舞蹈穿过主席台以后，成万名少先队员挥舞鲜花彩球，拥向主席台。周总理走到主席台两侧向欢乐的人群频频招手致意。这时，广场的欢乐气氛达到了最高潮。（附图片）
