During the visit, the Algerian Provisional Government delegation, headed by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Krim Belkacem, held talks with the government delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, headed by Deputy Prime Minister Vo Nguyen Giap, on the 4th. During the talks, both sides exchanged views on the current international situation, strengthening the unity and cooperation of Asian and African countries in the common struggle against colonialism and imperialism. The two sides also exchanged views on the situations in Algeria and Vietnam and emphasized the friendship and mutual support between the two countries.

On the afternoon of the same day, Krim Belkacem and other members of the delegation paid visits to President Ho Chi Minh and Premier Pham Van Dong.

Krim Belkacem then spoke at the banquet. He said that the people of Vietnam and Algeria are unwilling to be slaves of colonialism. The political experience of the two peoples has made them see that only by taking up arms and fighting can they defeat those blind colonialists who refuse to learn from their failures and accept warnings. He said that the Algerian people today gloriously believe that they are an important link in the noose that is being put around the neck of colonialism. He emphasized that "In the face of de Gaulle's plan, Algeria has only one path, which is to wage armed struggle like the Vietnamese people."
