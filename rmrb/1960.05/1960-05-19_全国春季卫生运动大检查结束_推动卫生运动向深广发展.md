Xinhua News Agency, May 18th:

    The national spring patriotic hygiene campaign inspection has concluded victoriously. This major inspection reviewed the progress of the movement, affirmed achievements, summarized and promoted experiences, and promptly put forward some suggestions for improvement to various regions. This has greatly promoted the hygiene movement to continue developing deeply and broadly at high speed and with high quality. At the same time, it has laid a favorable foundation for achieving greater success in the summer and year-round patriotic hygiene campaigns.
    This major inspection was jointly conducted by the Central Patriotic Hygiene Movement Committee, the Ministry of Health, and the Central Leading Group for Schistosomiasis Control (composed of nine people from the CCP Central Committee), together with relevant central departments and organizations such as the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Women's Federation, and the Communist Youth League. They formed seven inspection teams, inspecting many units in a total of 563 cities and counties (banners). Wherever they went, most areas presented a moving scene of people's physical and mental health and well-being, clean and beautiful environments, and thriving livestock breeding, with a completely new look.
    The reports from the inspection teams show that the biggest characteristic of this spring's patriotic hygiene campaign is that Party committees at all levels have strengthened their leadership over the hygiene movement. In many areas, the first secretary of the Party committee took the lead, arranging hygiene work in conjunction with the central task of production, grasping ideology, publicity, inspection, evaluation and competition, and summarizing experiences. Many Party committee secretaries also cultivated "hygiene experimental plots." Conducting the movement in a big way, creating momentum on a large scale, is the second characteristic of the movement. Various regions have used various forms to carry out hygiene publicity and education activities, and combined them with mass literacy education, running mass spare-time hygiene schools and training classes, etc., so that the great significance of the hygiene movement in changing customs and transforming the world has been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and the public's level of hygiene knowledge has been improved. The third characteristic is the vigorous promotion of technological innovation, which has improved the efficiency of eliminating the four pests and the quality of hygiene work. Many public canteens and food service industries have manufactured various mechanized and semi-mechanized equipment, which not only reduces physical labor and improves work efficiency, but also eliminates the chance of food contamination during the operation process.
    Inserting red flags, setting up models, and carrying out large-scale evaluation and competitions to create a upsurge of learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, surpassing the advanced, and helping the backward, promoting the hygiene movement to move towards higher standards, is the fourth characteristic of the spring patriotic hygiene movement. The advanced experiences of two red flags on the national hygiene front—the rural hygiene work in Jishan County, Shanxi Province, and the urban hygiene work in Foshan City, Guangdong Province—have been promoted in urban and rural areas across the country, greatly promoting the development of the urban and rural patriotic hygiene movement. A large number of advanced areas have emerged successively in various regions, and hygiene red flags and models have been established in their respective regions. The fifth characteristic of the movement is that the policy of expanding prevention with hospitals as the center has been implemented more deeply and comprehensively.
    From the reports of the inspection teams, it can be seen that the development of the patriotic hygiene movement is still uneven. A small number of areas still have weak links, and even advanced areas and units still have some areas where they are doing poorly. The work of completely eliminating mosquito and fly breeding grounds and harmless treatment of feces and garbage needs to be further strengthened. The technical guidance work cannot keep up with the in-depth development of the movement, and the work of summarizing and promoting the advanced experience of the masses is not done well enough. Some areas have not been able to effectively control and reduce some infectious diseases. When inspecting various places, the inspection teams also put forward realistic suggestions for improvement. At present, various regions are rapidly improving according to the opinions of the inspection teams.

    全国春季卫生运动大检查结束 
    推动卫生运动向深广发展
    春季卫生运动特点：
    各级党委加强了对运动的领导；大张旗鼓，大造声势，大搞技术革新，提高了除四害的效率和卫生工作质量；插红旗，树标兵，促进运动向高标准前进；以医院为中心扩大预防的方针，得到了更深入的全面的贯彻。
    据新华社18日讯　全国春季爱国卫生运动大检查已经胜利结束。这次大检查检阅了运动的进展情况，肯定了成绩，总结推广了经验，并且及时向各地提出一些改进的意见，从而大大促进了卫生运动继续以高速度、高质量向深广持续发展；同时，为夏季和全年爱国卫生运动取得更大的成绩奠定了有利基础。
    这次大检查，是由中央爱国卫生运动委员会、卫生部和中共中央防治血吸虫病九人小组，会同中央有关部门和工会、妇联、共青团等组织共同进行的。他们共组成了七个检查团，共检查了五百六十三个市、县（旗）的许多单位。所到之处，绝大部分地区呈现出群众身心健康舒畅，环境整洁美观，六畜繁殖兴旺，面貌焕然一新的动人景象。
    各检查团的汇报表明：今春爱国卫生运动的最大特点是各级党委都加强了对卫生运动的领导。许多地区都是党委第一书记挂帅，结合生产中心，布置卫生工作，抓思想、抓宣传、抓检查、抓评比竞赛、抓总结经验。许多党委书记还搞了“卫生试验田。”大张旗鼓，大造声势，是运动的第二个特点。各地利用各种形式展开卫生宣传教育活动。并且同群众业余教育扫盲运动、举办群众性业余卫生学校、训练班等结合起来，使卫生运动的移风易俗、改造世界的伟大意义深入人心，并且提高了群众的卫生知识水平。第三个特点是大搞技术革新，提高了除四害的效率和卫生工作的质量。许多公共食堂和饮食服务业制成各种机械化、半机械化的设备，不但减轻了体力劳动，提高了工作效率，而且杜绝了食品在操作过程中的污染机会。
    插红旗、树标兵、大搞评比竞赛，掀起学先进、赶先进、超先进、帮后进的热潮，促进卫生运动向着更高的标准前进，这是春季爱国卫生运动的第四个特色。全国卫生战线上的两面红旗——山西稷山县农村卫生工作和广东佛山市城市卫生工作的先进经验，已在各地城乡推广，大大推动了城市、农村爱国卫生运动的发展。各地先后涌现出了大批先进地区，树立起了本地区的卫生红旗和标兵。运动中的第五个特点，是以医院为中心扩大预防的方针得到了更深入的全面的贯彻。
    从各检查团的汇报中看出，目前爱国卫生运动的发展还是不平衡的。少数地区还有薄弱环节，即使是先进地区和单位也还有某些做得较差的地方。彻底消除蚊蝇孳生场所和粪便垃圾无害化处理的工作还有待进一步加强。技术指导工作还跟不上运动的深入发展，群众先进经验的总结和推广工作还做得不够。有些地区对有些传染病还没有能够有效地控制和缩小。各检查团在各地检查时，也实事求是地提出了改进的意见。目前，各地正根据检查团的意见迅速改进。
