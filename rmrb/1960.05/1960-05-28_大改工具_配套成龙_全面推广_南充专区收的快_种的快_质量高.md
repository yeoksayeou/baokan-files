    Vigorously Improve Tools, Form Complete Sets, and Promote Comprehensively:
    Nanchong Prefecture Reaps Quickly, Plants Quickly, and Achieves High Quality
    (Reported by this newspaper) Nanchong Prefecture, Sichuan Province, launched a mass campaign centered around agricultural "Ten Transformations" to vigorously develop semi-mechanized agricultural implements forming "Ten Production Lines," greatly accelerating the progress of summer harvesting and planting throughout the region. Currently, the harvesting of 2.86 million mu of rapeseed, barley, peas, and broad beans has been completed, and more than 60% of the 2.83 million mu of wheat has been harvested; 60% to 70% of the harvested crops have been threshed and stored. The transplanting of early rice and the sowing of cotton and peanuts have been completed throughout the prefecture, and 400,000 mu of mid-season rice, more than 50,000 mu of cotton, and more than 20,000 mu of sweet potatoes have been promptly planted, basically achieving simultaneous harvesting, plowing, and planting with good quality.
    The specific contents of the "Ten Transformations" and "Ten Production Lines" movement in Nanchong Prefecture, which involved industry supporting agriculture, are as follows: 1. Vehicle-ization and waterway transportation of transportation tools; 2. Mechanization and semi-mechanization of irrigation and drainage tools; 3. Improvement and semi-mechanization of tools for processing grain, feed, and other agricultural and sideline products; 4. Improvement and semi-mechanization of tilling tools; 5. Improvement and semi-mechanization of tools for field management and pest control; 6. Improvement and semi-mechanization of harvesting and threshing tools; 7. Improvement and semi-mechanization of basic construction tools; 8. Improvement, semi-mechanization, and mechanization of pig-raising tools; 9. Modernization and standardization of silkworm rearing tools; 10. Improvement and semi-mechanization of canteen tools.
    After the "Ten Transformations" and "Ten Production Lines" movement was launched, it immediately won the support of the broad masses of workers and the movement developed rapidly. Currently, Xichong County, Wusheng County, Yuechi County, and Yilong County have achieved improvement and semi-mechanization in various different aspects. These new-style tools and agricultural implements generally increase work efficiency by one to thirty times. According to incomplete statistics from Xichong County alone, more than 12 million labor days have been saved.
    In carrying out the "Ten Production Lines" movement, various localities have implemented the principle of prioritizing local methods and combining local and foreign methods. On the one hand, they vigorously develop improved tools, agricultural implements, and semi-mechanization; on the other hand, they also focus on manufacturing technically complex mechanized tools. For example, the Yilong County cotton production tool semi-mechanization production line has twenty-six kinds of tools that are all locally made. Among them, the cotton seeder is mainly made of wood and uses very little iron. One person can sow seven mu per day, which increases work efficiency sevenfold compared to manual sowing. These tools can be manufactured in district and commune factories, and are efficient, inexpensive, lightweight, and practical. Therefore, they were popularized throughout the county within two months, saving a total of more than 4.9 million labor days. In terms of power, various localities have also paid attention to making full use of hydraulic and animal power to replace human power. The prefecture promotes the use of animal-drawn tools in complete sets, such as animal-drawn trains, animal-drawn lathes, animal-drawn generators, and animal-drawn steel mills. In the manufacture of tools and agricultural implements, factories at the prefectural and county levels, which have better conditions, focus on producing foreign-style, mechanized, large and medium-sized tools, according to the policy of combining large, medium, and small enterprises; district and commune factories, which have poorer conditions, mainly produce local-style, semi-mechanized tools, while also focusing on trial manufacturing mechanized tools. This reasonable division of labor and mutual cooperation not only meets the needs of agricultural "Ten Transformations" to varying degrees but also equips district and commune factories.
    Establishing research and trial manufacturing institutions at all levels and establishing agricultural implement manufacturing plants is another key to the rapid and widespread promotion of the "Ten Production Lines" movement. Currently, agricultural implement manufacturing plants have been established at the prefectural, county, district, and commune levels. Each plant has also established workshops for trial manufacturing new-style agricultural implements and tools, forming a tool reform manufacturing network for vigorously developing semi-mechanized "Ten Production Lines." Any tools that are copied, improved, or invented by the masses are trial-manufactured in county, district, and commune tool and agricultural implement trial manufacturing workshops or groups. After successful trial production, they are then mass-produced and vigorously promoted after use appraisal and modification. In this way, the improvement and promotion of new agricultural implements and tools has a certain trial research base, which can better combine trial research work with promotion and use.
    In the movement, various localities paid attention to forming complete sets, comprehensive promotion, and continuous improvement. For example, the Xichong County sweet potato production and processing semi-mechanized production line of tools is a combination of the ridge-digging tool created by the masses in this county and the feed chopper manufactured in Peng'an County and the materials from Wusheng. Secondly, according to regional characteristics, tasks are assigned, focusing on studying the future reform direction of a certain production project or a complete set of tools, in order to concentrate the main forces and break through key points. For example, Wusheng County, which raises a lot of pigs, focuses on creating pig-raising tools; Yilong County, which grows a lot of cotton, focuses on studying the "one-stop" tool reform for cotton production from sowing to harvesting. In the promotion and use of agricultural implements, the method of using them while promoting them, constantly reforming them, and constantly improving them is adopted, so that some innovative agricultural implements can achieve multiple uses and comprehensive utilization.

    大改工具　配套成龙　全面推广
    南充专区收的快　种的快　质量高
    本报讯　四川南充专区围绕农业“十化”大搞农具半机械“十条龙”的群众运动，使全区夏收夏种进度大大加快。目前全区二百八十六万亩油菜、大麦、豌豆和胡豆已经收割结束，二百八十三万亩小麦，已收60％以上；已收回的作物，有60％至70％都脱粒入库。全区早稻栽插、棉花和花生播种已经结束，并及时抢栽了中稻四十万亩、五万多亩棉花和两万多亩红苕，基本上做到了边收边耕边种，质量良好。
    南充专区开展的工业支援农业的“十化”、“十条龙”的具体内容是：一、交通运输工具车子化、船运化；二、排灌工具机械化、半机械化；三、粮食、饲料及其他农副产品加工工具改良化、半机械化；四、耕作工具改良化、半机械化；五、田间管理、治虫工具改良化、半机械化；六、收割脱粒工具农具改良化、半机械化；七、基本建设工具改良化、半机械化；八、养猪工具改良化、半机械化、机械化；九、蚕房工具新式化、标准化；十、食堂工具改良化、半机械化。
    “十化”、“十条龙”运动提出后，立即获得广大职工群众的拥护，运动发展很快。现在西充县、武胜县、岳池县、仪陇县分别在各个不同的方面实现了改良化和半机械化。这些新式工具和农具一般都能提高工效一倍到三十倍。仅据西充县的不完全统计，已节约劳动力一千二百多万个。
    各地在开展“十条龙”运动中，贯彻了以土为主，土洋结合的原则。一方面大搞改良工具农具半机械化，另一方面也抓紧制造技术复杂的机械化工具。如仪陇县的棉花生产工具半机械化一条龙，有二十六种工具都是土的。其中棉花播种机主要用木料制成，用铁很少，一人一天可播种七亩，比手播提高工效七倍。这些工具在区、社工厂都能制造，而且效高价廉，轻便适用。因此，短短两个月内就普及全县，共可节约劳动力四百九十多万个。在动力方面，各地还注意充分利用水力畜力来代替人力。全区成套地推广牛拉工具，如牛拉列车、牛拉车床、牛拉发电机、牛拉钢磨等。制造工具、农具中，还根据大中小相结合的方针，条件较好的专、县工厂，着重生产洋的、机械化的、大中型的；条件较差的区、社工厂，主要生产土的、半机械化的，同时重点试制机械化的工具。这样合理分工，互相协作，既不同程度地满足了农业“十化”的需要，又装备了区社工厂。
    层层建立研究试制机构，成立农具制造厂，是“十条龙”运动能够迅速普遍推行的另一关键。目前专、县、区、公社都已建立了农具工具制造厂，每个厂还成立了试制新式农具和工具的车间，形成了大搞半机械化“十条龙”的工具改革制造网。凡是仿制、改制和群众创造发明的工具，在县、区、公社工具农具试制车间或小组试制成功后，经使用鉴定、修改，再成批生产，大力推广。这样，使改良和推广新农具工具，有一定试制研究基地，能更好地把试制研究工作和推广使用结合起来。
    各地在运动中，注意了配套成龙，全面推广，不断提高。如西充县的红苕生产和加工半机械化一条龙工具，是本县群众创造的和蓬安制造的刨厢器、武胜的切饲料机共同组合的。其次，根据地区特点，分配任务，着重研究某一生产项目或整套工具今后的改革方向，以便集中主要力量，突破重点。例如，武胜县养猪多，就着重创造养猪工具；仪陇棉花种得多，就着重研究棉花生产从播种到收的“一条龙”的工具改革。在农具的推广使用中，采取了边推广边使用，不断改革、不断提高的方法，使部分革新农具做到了一机多用、综合利用。（附图片）
