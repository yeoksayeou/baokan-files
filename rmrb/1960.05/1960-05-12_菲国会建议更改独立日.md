Xinhua News Agency, Manila, 7th: It is reported that the Philippine House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, in a bill on April 30, suggested changing the Philippines' Independence Day from July 4 to June 12.

The basis for this suggestion is that June 12, 1898, was the day that Philippine President General Emilio Aguinaldo declared independence from Spanish rule, while July 4 was the day the U.S. President stipulated and recognized Philippine independence.

The Foreign Affairs Committee's suggestion has received widespread support from Philippine public opinion, which has long demanded that June 12 be chosen as the official Independence Day in order to show that the United States did not grant the Philippines independence, but merely restored the independence that the Filipino people had gained from Spain.

    菲国会建议更改独立日
    据新华社7日讯　马尼拉消息：据报道，菲律宾众议院外交委员会4月30日在一项法案中建议把菲律宾的独立日由7月4日改为6月12日。
    这项建议的根据是，1898年6月12日是菲律宾总统埃米略·阿吉纳多将军宣布摆脱西班牙的统治而独立的日子，而7月4日是美国总统规定和承认菲律宾独立的日子。
    外交委员会的建议受到菲律宾舆论的广泛支持，长期以来舆论就一直要求挑择6月12日为正式独立日以便表明美国并没有给予菲律宾独立，而只不过是恢复了菲律宾人从西班牙那里取得的独立而已。
