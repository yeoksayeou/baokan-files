Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 5th: According to the Vietnam News Agency, Bui Ky, Chairman of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association, gave a statement to the Vietnam News Agency reporters on May 4th regarding Premier Zhou Enlai's upcoming visit to Vietnam. He said that Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Vietnam once again proves that Vietnam and China often care for and help each other, and it is also a great encouragement to the Vietnamese people.

He said that Vietnam and China have a special affection, and no Vietnamese people do not regard China as their friend and close brother who share weal and woe.

Bui Ky said that China made a significant contribution to the victory of the Bandung Conference, and the spirit of this conference has become increasingly widespread and deeply rooted in the hearts of the broad masses of oppressed peoples.

Bui Ky said that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are developing more broadly and becoming the basis for solving all international problems, and the agreements on the Sino-Burmese and Sino-Nepalese border issues are the most powerful evidence in this regard.
