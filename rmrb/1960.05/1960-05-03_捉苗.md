Title: Protecting Seedlings

    Protecting the emergence of seedlings, ensuring complete stands, and guaranteeing strong seedlings are all commonly referred to as "zhuō miáo" (捉苗, "protecting seedlings") by farmers in many places. Seedlings emerge, and are complete and strong, then it’s said that the "seedlings have been caught." This fully demonstrates the farmers' desire for complete and strong seedlings. In the past, when people had little understanding of natural laws, farming was truly like being blindfolded, with a considerable degree of blindness. Only when the seedlings emerged relatively uniformly and appeared to be growing well could people breathe a sigh of relief and say, "This time, we've caught you!"

    Under the leadership of the Party, people have further taken control of their own destiny, and consequently, have further taken control of the destiny of nature. People, using the highly organized strength of the People's Communes, under the conditions of fully preparing various tasks before sowing and improving sowing techniques, put forward a new battle cry: "One sowing, one complete stand of seedlings!" Even "Eliminate the third-class seedlings before sowing!" Now, it is no longer a person "catching" with their eyes covered, but a collective of people "catching" with bright eyes. How can they not be full of confidence!

    However, various natural phenomena are intricate and complex. Now, we have grasped their laws more than in the past, but it is not to say that we have completely grasped them. The degree of seed selection, land leveling, and appropriate water and fertilizer will always be subject to certain conditions; the climate changes and pest situations after sowing cannot be fully predicted in advance. Therefore, while striving for a complete stand of seedlings with one sowing, preparations should also be made for the possibility of not achieving a complete stand. When sowing cotton, many People's Communes in Shandong, in addition to appropriately increasing the sowing quantity, also plant "reserve seedlings," that is, planting an extra row every ten or so rows in preparation for transplanting when seedlings are missing. Some People's Communes in Gansu cultivate cotton seedlings in nutrient pots while sowing cotton, in preparation for replanting. Shaanxi Province requires that after completing the planned cotton planting area, additional cotton be planted as "insurance cotton fields." Doing so builds confidence on a more reliable foundation.

    The "ensuring a complete stand of seedlings" that we are talking about now has a higher standard than in the past, that is, the standard of rational close planting. This requires "catching" more seedlings, and that they be distributed more evenly in the ground and grow more vigorously.

    On the one hand, strive for a complete stand of seedlings with one sowing; on the other hand, prepare for the possibility of not achieving a complete stand. This seems contradictory, but is actually unified. The goal is only one: a complete stand of seedlings—not just a complete stand of seedlings according to the old standards, but according to the new standards. In striving for complete victory, one cannot be without "reserves"; in striving for a complete stand of seedlings, one cannot be without "reserve seedlings."

    On the one hand, work with the confidence and measures to strive for 100% success; on the other hand, prepare to deal with less favorable situations, so that even if we take a step back, we can still achieve 100% victory; if the situation is favorable, use the prepared forces to strive for even greater victory. This is also a working method worth emulating.

    捉　苗
    杨岭
    保出苗、保全苗、保壮苗，在很多地方农民把这些事情通称为“捉苗”。苗出来了，而且又全又壮，就叫做“捉住了苗”。这充分表现了农民盼望苗全苗壮的心情。在过去人对自然规律掌握得还很少的时代，种地也真像眼睛上蒙着手帕，有相当程度的盲目性，直到苗出得比较齐了，看来长得很好，才能松一口气说：“这次可把你们捉住了！”
    在党的领导下，人们进一步掌握了自己的命运，随着也就进一步地掌握了自然的命运。人们运用人民公社高度组织起来的力量，在充分做好播种的各种准备工作和提高播种技术的条件下，提出了新的战斗口号：“一次播种，一次全苗！”甚至“把三类苗消灭在播种之前！”现在已经不是一个人蒙着眼睛在“捉”，而是集体的人睁着明亮的眼在“捉”，这又怎能不信心百倍！
    可是，各种自然现象是错综复杂的，现在比过去是更多地掌握了它们的规律，但并不是说已经完完全全掌握了它们的规律。种子精选、土地平整和水肥适宜的程度，总还受着一定条件的限制；播种后的气候变化、虫情变化等等，也还不能事先完全预计到。因此，在力求一次出全苗的同时，还要作一次不能全苗的准备。山东许多人民公社在播种棉花的时候，除适当加大播种量以外，还种下了“预备苗”，也就是每隔十来行多播一行，以备缺苗的时候移栽。甘肃一些人民公社在播种棉花的同时，用营养钵培育棉苗，备作补苗之用。陕西省要求在按计划完成棉花播种面积之外，再多种若干棉花作为“保险棉田”。这样做，是把信心建立在更加可靠的基础上。
    我们现在所说的保全苗，比过去的保全苗有更高的标准，也就是合理密植的标准。这就要求“捉住”更多的苗，而且要它们在地里分布得更均匀，生长得更茁壮。
    一方面力求一次全苗；另方面又作一次不能全苗的准备。看起来是矛盾的，实际上是统一的。目的只有一个，就是全苗——不只是旧标准的全苗，而且是新标准的全苗。争全胜，不可没有“后备军”；争全苗，不可没有“预备苗”。
    一方面用力争百分之百成功的信心和措施去工作；另方面准备应付不那么顺利的情况，以求退一步仍能取得百分之百的胜利；如果情况顺利，就运用准备下的力量争取更大的胜利。这也是值得效法的一个工作方法。
