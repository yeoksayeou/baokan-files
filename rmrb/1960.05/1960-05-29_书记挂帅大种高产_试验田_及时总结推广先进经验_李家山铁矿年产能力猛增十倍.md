Chengdu, May 24th (Report from this newspaper) - The Li Jiashan Iron Mine in Leshan Prefecture, Sichuan Province, is vigorously carrying out a mechanization and semi-mechanization movement based on indigenous methods and combining indigenous and foreign techniques. It has comprehensively and systematically transformed various aspects of mining, tunneling, and transportation. In just over two months, the mine's annual production capacity has increased from over 100,000 tons to over 1 million tons. The ore output in the first quarter exceeded the total output for the entire previous year, and the ore output in April approached the total output of the first quarter. This not only guaranteed the needs of blast furnace production but also saved 28.5% of the mine's workforce, who were then deployed to support new construction projects.

The Li Jiashan Iron Mine has rugged terrain, scattered mining areas, and poor transportation conditions. Before the technical transformation, the entire production process was manual. This year, due to the rapid and sustained high production of the Leshan Iron and Steel Plant, which the iron mine supplies, increasing by nearly 50% on average each month, the demand for ore has increased exponentially. Therefore, manual operations could no longer meet the needs. To adapt to the rapid leap forward in iron smelting production, the iron mine party committee decided to carry out a comprehensive technical transformation of mining, tunneling, and transportation. They formulated a comprehensive plan to transform the mine, with the party committee secretary taking personal charge. A specialized leading body for mechanization and semi-mechanization was established, and 10% of the workforce was selected to form fifteen professional technical transformation teams. Party committee members and branch secretaries were assigned responsibility for specific areas. A combination of professional team transformation and mass movement was adopted to strengthen leadership at all levels and launch a large-scale, concentrated transformation campaign.

During the mass technical transformation movement, the iron mine party committee resolutely criticized the right-leaning and fearful thinking of some people who emphasized "no materials, no technology, and no tools." Closely integrating with current production, they adopted the approach of using foreign methods when possible, indigenous methods when necessary, and a combination of indigenous and foreign techniques. They mobilized the masses to work hard and cleverly, relying on their own efforts. For example, without ventilation equipment in the mines, they used natural ventilation and wooden blowers. Without hoists at the mine entrances, they built their own indigenous hoists. Without steel rails, they used iron-wood rails instead. Without steel cables, they wove bamboo ropes themselves. In mining, workers created methods such as foot-operated double hammers, hand-operated double techniques, and synchronized hammer blows, increasing efficiency by one to three times. For underground transportation, they created fire-starters, indigenous trains, and self-unloading ore cars, increasing efficiency by about five times. For ground transportation, they built about 20 kilometers of various transportation lines, mainly aerial tramways, and manufactured more than 900 vehicles, fully realizing the tooling of transportation. This rapidly increased the level of mechanization and semi-mechanization in the mine, and the output and transportation volume of ore increased month by month.

The fundamental reason why the Li Jiashan Iron Mine transformed quickly and well lies in the mine party committee's conscientious implementation of the spirit of continuous revolution and its consistent adherence to the leadership method of cultivating "experimental plots." At the beginning of this year, the mine party committee focused on the No. 3 working area and cultivated a high-yield "experimental plot" with three red flags. Using the method of dissecting a sparrow, they experimented, summarized, improved, and popularized simultaneously. Based on the characteristics of the mining area, with its high mountains, steep roads, and inconvenient transportation, the party committee's "experimental plot" first focused on a concentrated effort in transportation, focusing on the construction of aerial tramways, and using the tramways to drive other aspects. In less than a month, the length of aerial tramway lines in the entire mine more than doubled, greatly improving transportation efficiency. As the volume of ore transportation increased rapidly, a new problem emerged: production could not keep up with transportation. The party committee immediately shifted its main focus to vigorously advancing the mechanization of mining. After repeated research with the workers, they successively created mechanized tools and advanced experiences for tunneling, drilling, and blasting. After the high-yield barrier was broken through in early March, the transportation link lagged behind again. The party committee secretary then shifted the main force to the automation of aerial tramways, organizing workers to jointly research and successfully develop automatic loading, unloading, and braking devices, and promoted automobile loading platforms, accelerating the turnaround time of various transportation tools. In this way, one link tightly connected to another, promoting each other and enabling production to continuously develop forward in one high tide after another.

    书记挂帅大种高产“试验田”及时总结推广先进经验
    李家山铁矿年产能力猛增十倍
    本报成都24日电　四川省乐山专区李家山铁矿大力开展以土法为主，土洋结合的机械化、半机械化运动，对矿山开采、掘进、运输等各个环节进行全面系统的技术改造，在短短两个多月里，使矿山年产能力由十多万吨提高到一百多万吨。第一季度矿石产量超过了去年全年总产量，4月份矿石产量又接近了第一季度产量的总和，不仅保证了高炉生产的需要，同时，还节约了占全矿职工人数28.5％的劳动力去支援新建企业。
    李家山铁矿由于地势崎岖，矿区分散，交通条件很差。技术改造前，全部生产过程都是手工操作。今年以来，由于这个铁矿对口供应的乐山钢铁厂平均每月以递增将近50％的速度大幅度持续高产，要求供应的矿石成倍增加，因此矿山依靠手工操作已远远不能满足需要。为了适应炼铁生产飞速跃进的需要，铁矿党委决定对采矿、掘进、运输进行全面技术改造，并制订了全面改造矿山的规划，由党委书记亲自挂帅，成立了机械化、半机械化的专门领导机构，抽出10％的劳动力分别组成十五个专业技术改造队，由党委委员和支部书记分别包干，采取专业队改造和大搞群众运动相结合的方法，层层加强领导，展开了大规模的突击改造运动。
    在群众性的技术改造运动中，铁矿党委坚决批判了有的人强调“一无材料，二无技术，三无工具”等右倾畏难思想，紧密结合当前生产，采取能洋则洋、能土则土、土洋结合的办法，发动群众穷干巧干，自力更生。例如，井下没有通风设备，他们就利用自然通风和木质鼓风机鼓风；井口没有卷扬机，就自制土卷扬机；没有钢轨，就以铁木轨道代替；没有钢丝绳，就自己动手编竹索。在采矿方面，工人们创造了脚踏二锤、手摇二技、参锤一响等方法，分别提高工效一倍到三倍；井下运输创造了掀火器、土火车、自动卸渣矿车等，提高工效五倍左右。地面运输先后共建设了以索道为主的各种运输线路约二十公里，造车九百多部，全部实现了运输工具化。因此迅速提高了矿山机械化、半机械化程度，矿石产量和运输量月月“打滚加番”。
    李家山铁矿所以改造得快，改造得好，根本原因是在于矿山党委认真贯彻了不断革命精神，自始至终坚持了种“试验田”的领导方法。今年一开始，矿党委就以三工区为重点种了一个三面红旗高产“试验田”，用解剖麻雀的方法，边试验，边总结，边提高、边普及。根据矿区山高路险，运输不便的特点，党委“试验田”首先以突击运输为主攻方向，狠抓索道建设，并以索道带动其他。不到一个月，全矿索道线路就增加了一倍以上，运输效率大大提高。由于矿石运输量很快增加，又出现了生产供不上运输的新问题。党委又立即转变主攻方向，大力突击开采方面的机械化。经过与工人反复研究，先后创造了掘进、打眼、放炮等机械化工具和先进经验。3月初，矿山高产关突破后，运输环节又落后了，党委书记又把主力转向索道自动化方面，组织工人共同研究成功了自动装卸和自动刹车装置，推行了汽车装车台等，加速了各种运输工具周转时间。这样，就使一环紧扣一环，互相推动，使生产上一个高潮接一个高潮地不断向前发展。
