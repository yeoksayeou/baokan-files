    Shanxi Province Launches Seedling Inspection and Replenishment Campaign

    Shanxi Province is entering the final, intense stage of spring planting. Spring wheat, cotton, and some oil crops have been basically planted, while corn, sorghum, millet, and tuber crops are being planted in a concentrated effort. In order to lay a solid foundation for a bumper harvest of spring crops, all localities have launched a campaign of seedling inspection, replenishment, ensuring planting area, and ensuring full seedling emergence.

    Shanxi encountered a severe drought during the spring planting season this year. Therefore, many places prepared for seedling replenishment from the beginning of planting. In the Jinan Prefecture, cotton-producing counties universally established seedling cultivation bases in the fields and vigorously promoted nutrition pot seedling cultivation, replenishing seedlings wherever there were gaps. In the Jinbei area, some counties mobilized experienced farmers and technicians to contribute ideas before inspecting and replenishing seedlings, improving seedling inspection and replenishment techniques to ensure that every transplanted seedling survives.

      Jilin and Gansu Exceed Sweet Beet Planting Plan

    Jilin Province completed its sweet beet planting plan ahead of schedule. This year's sweet beet planting was about twenty days earlier than last year, and the planting quality was also significantly improved compared to previous years.

    Currently, various localities are strengthening field management of sweet beets, entering the hoeing stage centered on insect prevention and seedling protection, and preparing to topdress the sweet beets with fertilizer.

    By May 15, Gansu Province had exceeded its sweet beet planting plan, with a planting area expanded by more than 33% compared to last year. Gansu Province only began to develop sweet beet production in a planned way in 1958. Due to the large temperature difference between day and night, high potassium content in the soil, dry climate, and few black spot diseases, the area is suitable for sweet beet growth, and has achieved bumper harvests in the past two years.

        Jiangxi Launches a "Small Rice Transplanting" Campaign

    After completing early rice transplanting, various localities in Jiangxi Province launched a "small rice transplanting" campaign. As of May 11, the province's "small rice transplanting" planting area had exceeded the original plan by 800,000 mu. After the expansion work was completed, various localities adopted methods of segmenting, dividing areas, and assigning work quotas to strengthen field management of the expanded early rice planting.

          Zhejiang Uses New Tools to Harvest Spring Flowers

    Zhejiang Province universally promoted the use of various new tools in the comprehensive harvest of spring flower crops. The province has promoted more than 500,000 large sickles, 100,000 rapid harvesters, and more than 160,000 threshing machines. These new tools, which are highly efficient and easy to use, have played a great role in the harvest. As of the 10th, the province had harvested and threshed more than 2.7 million mu of spring flower crops.

      Henan "Sends Treasures" to the Countryside to Promote Technological Reform

    The Henan Province Tool Reform Office and eight other units formed a "treasure seeking and sending" team for irrigation, drainage, summer harvesting, and summer planting tools, and went to various parts of the province to "seek treasures and send treasures" to further promote the rural technical innovation and technical revolution movement.

    This "treasure seeking and sending" team, composed of more than 70 cadres, technicians, and local experts, brought a rich and colorful array of items to the countryside. They promoted many simple machines and advanced experiences, mainly including twelve items. Such as the nationally standardized Taigu harvester, wheat thresher, a simple car successfully trial-produced in Zhengzhou City, and the five-changes-six-use weeding hoe of the Daying People's Commune in Sanmenxia City. After hearing the "treasure seeking and sending" team introduce advanced experience and seeing their on-site demonstrations, cadres and commune members in Dengfeng County immediately drew 50 drawings of seeders, cotton thinners, vegetable cutters, and other equipment.

          Hubei Rapeseed Harvest Completed

    The rapeseed harvest in Hubei Province has been completed, most of it has been threshed, and some areas with faster threshing have completed the rapeseed purchase task ahead of schedule and exceeded the target.

    The rapeseed in Hubei Province grew very well this year, and it is a bumper year. Party committees at all levels paid close attention to the rapeseed purchase work early and specifically. As early as early April, various localities made specific arrangements, issued tasks, and established summer grain purchase command organizations. The rapeseed harvesting, threshing, delivery, and processing work in various localities have been carried out relatively quickly. Echeng County completed the harvesting and threshing of 32,000 mu of rapeseed in seven days, and completed more than half of the rapeseed purchase task.

    要闻快报
    山西省开展查苗补苗运动
    山西省春播进入了最后紧张阶段，春麦、棉花和部分油料作物已基本种完，玉米、高粱、谷子、薯类作物正在突击抢种。为了给春播作物丰收打好基础，各地都开展了查苗、补苗、保面积、保全苗运动。
    山西今年春播期间遇到严重的干旱，因此许多地方在播种开始的时候就作了补苗的准备。晋南专区各产棉县普遍在地头建立了育苗基地和大搞营养钵育苗，见缺即补。晋北地区有的县在查苗补苗之前，发动老农、技术员献计献策，提高了查苗补苗技术，做到移一株活一株。
      吉林甘肃超额完成甜菜播种计划
    吉林省提前完成了甜菜播种计划。今年甜菜播种比去年提早二十天左右，播种质量也比往年有显著提高。
    目前，各地正在加强甜菜的田间管理，进入以防虫保苗为中心的铲趟阶段，并准备为甜菜追肥。
    甘肃省至5月15日已超额完成甜菜种植计划，种植面积比去年扩大33％以上。甘肃省从1958年才开始有计划地发展甜菜生产，由于当地昼夜温差大，土壤含钾多，气候干燥，少黑斑病，适宜甜菜生长，两年来都获得了大丰收。
        江西开展“小插秧”运动
    江西省各地在完成早稻插秧以后掀起了一个“小插秧”运动。到5月11日止，全省“小插秧”播种面积已超过原订计划八十万亩。扩种工作结束后，各地采取了分段、分片、定工包干的办法，加强了扩种早稻的田间管理。
          浙江用新工具收割春花
    浙江省在全面收获春花作物中，普遍推广使用各种新工具。全省已推广大镰刀五十万多把、快速收割器十万部、打稻机十六万多台。这些工效高、使用方便的新工具在收获中发挥了很大的威力。全省到10日止，已收割和脱粒的春花作物达二百七十多万亩。
      河南“送宝”下乡促进技术改革
    河南省工具改革办公室等九个单位，组成排灌和夏收夏种工具“取经送宝”队分赴全省各地“取经送宝”，进一步促进农村技术革新和技术革命运动。
    这支由七十多名干部、技术员和土专家组成的“取经送宝”队，下乡送宝内容丰富多采。他们推广的简易机具和先进经验很多，主要的有十二项。如全国定型的太谷号收割机、小麦脱粒机、郑州市试制成功的简易汽车，三门峡市大营人民公社的五改六用耘锄等。登封县各人民公社的干部和社员，听了“取经送宝”队介绍先进经验，看到他们现场表演后，当场绘下播种机、棉花间苗器、切菜机等图样五十张。
          湖北油菜收割完毕
    湖北省油菜已收割完毕，大部分已经脱粒，脱粒快的一些地区已提前超额完成了油菜籽的收购任务。
    今年湖北省油菜长得很好，是丰收年景。各级党委对油菜籽的收购工作抓的早、抓的具体。早在4月上旬，各地就作了具体布置，下达了任务，还分别成立了夏粮收购指挥机构。各地油菜收割、打场、交售和加工工作都进行的比较快。鄂城县三万二千亩油菜七天就收打完毕了，并且完成油菜籽收购任务一半以上。
