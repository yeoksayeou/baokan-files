Xinhua News Agency, Kathmandu, 28th (Delayed Dispatch): Premier Zhou Enlai delivered a radio speech on Nepal Radio on April 28th. The full text is as follows:

Dear Nepalese friends:

Vice Premier Chen Yi, my other colleagues, and I will bid farewell to your country tomorrow after a three-day friendly visit. This visit has given us the opportunity to see your beautiful and prosperous country and your hardworking and brave people once again. We feel very honored and happy. From the moment we set foot on your beautiful land, whether in Kathmandu or Pokhara, we have been warmly welcomed and meticulously cared for by His Majesty the King of Nepal's government and people. These moving scenes vividly reflect the growing friendly relations between our two peoples. On the eve of our departure, we once again express our heartfelt thanks and best wishes to you, wishing your country prosperity and your people happiness.

Our two peoples have had a deep traditional friendship since ancient times. In recent times, the friendly relations between our two countries have developed rapidly. Now, I can report to you that during my visit to your country, after further talks between the leaders of the two governments, our two governments have decided to sign a treaty of peace and friendship. This is another major event in the friendly relations between our two countries, following the agreement on the border issue and the economic assistance agreement. The signing of this treaty and the implementation of the two agreements will bring the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries into a new stage, which is very encouraging.

This new development in the friendly relations between our two countries is not accidental. Our two peoples have a strong desire for mutual friendship and cooperation. Our two countries are economically and culturally backward. In order to build our respective countries, we both need a lasting international environment of peace. We have always adhered to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Spirit. The treaty and agreements signed between our two countries undoubtedly conform to the fundamental interests of our two peoples. I firmly believe that the trend of our two peoples demanding friendly cooperation is unstoppable, and Sino-Nepalese friendship will last forever like the lofty and pure Himalayas. The Himalayas will forever link the hearts of our two peoples together.

Dear Nepalese friends, we are returning full of your deep friendship, and we must convey this friendship to all the Chinese people. Finally, please allow me to express my deep gratitude to you once again.

Long live Sino-Nepalese friendship!

    周恩来总理在尼泊尔电台发表讲话
    中尼友好关系进入新阶段
    新华社加德满都28日电　（迟到）周恩来总理4月28日在尼泊尔电台发表了广播讲话，全文如下：亲爱的尼泊尔朋友们：
    我和陈毅副总理以及其他的同事们在你们的国家进行了三天的友好访问之后，明天就要向你们告别了。这次访问使我们有机会再一次见到你们美丽、富饶的国家，见到你们勤劳、勇敢的人民，我们感到十分荣幸和高兴。从我们一踏上你们美丽的国土，无论是在加德满都或者是博克拉，我们到处受到尼泊尔国王陛下政府和人民的热烈欢迎和无微不至的款待。这些令人感动的场面生动地体现了我们两国人民之间的日益发展的友好关系。在这临别的前夕，我们再一次向你们表示衷心的感谢和最良好的祝愿，祝你们国家繁荣，人民幸福。
    我们两国人民自古以来就有着深厚的传统友谊。最近一个时期，我们两国的友好关系更有了突飞猛进的发展。现在，我可以向大家报告，在我访问贵国期间，经过两国政府领导人进一步的会谈，我们两国政府已经决定签订和平友好条约。这是继两国关于边界问题协定和经济援助协定之后，在我们两国友好关系上的又一件大事。这个条约的签订和两个协定的实施将使我们两国的友好合作关系进入一个新的阶段，这是令人十分欢欣鼓舞的。
    我们两国友好关系的这种新的发展不是偶然的。我们两国人民有着互相友好合作的强烈愿望。我们两国的经济文化都很落后。为了建设我们各自的国家，我们都需要一个持久的国际和平环境。我们都一贯遵循和平共处的五项原则和万隆精神。我们两国签订的条约和协定，无疑是符合我们两国人民的根本利益的。我深信，我们两国人民要求友好合作的潮流是不可阻挡的，中尼友谊将像崇高纯洁的喜马拉雅山一样万古长存。喜马拉雅山将永远把我们两国人民的心连系在一起。
    亲爱的尼泊尔朋友们，我们满载了你们深厚的友谊回去，我们一定要把你们这种友谊传达给全体中国人民。最后，请允许我再一次向你们表示深深的谢意。
    中尼友好万岁！
