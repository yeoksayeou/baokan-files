Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 24th: In recent days, a "chaotic political struggle" has unfolded within the US ruling group, further exposing the failure of the US government's aggressive policies.

In this dispute, Democrats attacked the Republican government for committing "major errors," its foreign policy suffering "failures." The Democratic Advisory Council issued a statement on May 22nd, signed by many influential figures within the Democratic Party, harshly criticizing the Eisenhower administration for committing "a series of major mistakes" in its foreign policy.

The statement emphasized that the "series of errors" committed by the Eisenhower government this time were "not just some isolated major mistakes," but rather "a series of the biggest embarrassments" that the United States had suffered in its foreign policy in the past decade. The statement called for a public debate on the "series of errors" committed by the Eisenhower government. Among those who signed the statement were former US President Truman, prominent Democratic leader Stevenson, and Democratic Senators and presidential hopefuls Kennedy and Symington.

On May 20th, hours before Eisenhower returned to Washington from Paris, thirty-eight Democratic Congressmen issued a statement blaming Eisenhower for "damaging" the United States' "prestige in the world" and its so-called "leadership position." In their statement, they raised a series of questions, demanding that he answer them publicly. These questions included: "Why did the President, as the head of our country, announce in advance that he intended to return to Washington before the end of the conference, to be replaced by the Vice President? Why was the U-2 aircraft ordered to fly over Soviet airspace precisely before the summit meeting? When the U-2 aircraft incident was announced, why did government officials issue a series of contradictory and false statements, and who should be held responsible for this? Why, on the eve of the summit meeting, did the government order a worldwide military alert exercise from Paris? Why did the government initially state that, as a national policy, it would continue to fly over Russia, and then change its approach to say that it had ordered the cessation of such flights?" and so on.

The Democratic Party's attack on the Republican government was initiated by Stevenson, a prominent Democratic leader, in Chicago on May 19th. Stevenson again criticized the US government on May 21st.

After Stevenson delivered his speech on May 21st, the Republican Party retaliated that same day. The Republican National Committee issued a statement on May 21st attacking Stevenson for delivering a "damaging" and "reckless" speech "at a critical moment." Morton, chairman of the Republican National Committee, also accused Stevenson of "slandering the President" and "playing with fire politically" at a Republican rally in Maryland. Vice President Nixon also instructed his press secretary to express "great surprise" at Stevenson's speech.

Senate Democratic Leader Johnson recently expressed concern in a statement about this "chaos, discord, and frustration" within the ruling group. He emphasized "unity" and called on the two parties to stop arguing and "take action" to strengthen military power to deal with the Soviet Union.

    挑衅失败互相指责　谎言破产丑态毕露
    美国统治集团内部争吵不休
    民主党大骂共和党政府犯了“重大错误”使美国处境狼狈
    共和党指责民主党拆艾森豪威尔的台是“在政治上玩火”
    据新华社24日讯　华盛顿消息：最近几天来，在美国统治集团内部正展开被形容为“一场混乱的政治斗争”，这些争吵进一步暴露了美国政府侵略政策的失败。
    在这场争吵中，民主党攻击共和党政府犯了“重大错误”，它的外交政策遭受了“失败”。民主党谘询委员会22日发表了一项由民主党内许多有影响的人物签字的声明，大骂艾森豪威尔政府在外交政策中犯了“一系列大错”。
    声明强调艾森豪威尔政府这次所犯的“一系列错误”“并不只是一些孤立的大错”，而是美国十年来在外交政策上遭到“一系列最大的丢脸的大错”。声明要求对艾森豪威尔政府就这次所犯的“一系列错误”举行公开的辩论。在这项声明中签字的有美国前总统杜鲁门、民主党主要领袖之一史蒂文森、民主党参议员、总统候选人竞争者肯尼迪和薛明顿等人。
    20日，当艾森豪威尔从巴黎返抵华盛顿前几小时，三十八个民主党众议员发表了一项声明，责备艾森豪威尔使美国“在世界上的威信”和所谓“领导地位”“受到损害”。他们在声明中提出一连串的问题，要求他公开回答。这些问题包括：“为什么总统作为我们国家的首脑，事先宣布他打算在会议结束以前回到华盛顿，要由副总统来代替他？为什么恰好在最高级会议以前命令U—2型飞机飞越苏联上空？当U—2型飞机事件公布时，为什么政府官员发表了一系列自相矛盾的和虚假的声明，谁应对此负责？为什么在最高级会议前夕，政府要从巴黎下令举行一次世界规模的军事戒备演习？为什么政府起先表示，作为一个国策，它将继续在俄国上空的飞行，然后又改变它自己的作法说已经命令不继续这种飞行？”等等。
    民主党对共和党政府的攻讦是由民主党主要领袖之一的史蒂文森19日在芝加哥发难的。史蒂文森在21日再次指责美国政府。
    史蒂文森21日发表演说之后，共和党当天就向他还击。共和党全国委员会在21日发表的一篇声明中攻击史蒂文森“在紧要关头发表了一篇造成重大损失的”、“轻率的”演说。共和党全国委员会主席摩顿在马里兰州共和党一个集会上也指责史蒂文森“诽谤总统”，“在政治上玩火”。副总统尼克松也授意他的新闻秘书对史蒂文森的讲话表示“大为惊讶”。
    参议院民主党领袖约翰逊最近在一项声明中对统治集团内部这样一团“混乱、不和和沮丧”表示忧虑。他强调“团结”，要求两党停止争吵，“采取行动”加强军事力量以对付苏联。
