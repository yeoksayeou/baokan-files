Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 14th: The Soviet government lodged a strong protest with the Turkish and Pakistani governments on May 13th regarding the provision of bases by Turkey and Pakistan for US planes intruding into Soviet airspace. The note emphasized that if similar acts of aggression occur again, the Soviet government will have to take countermeasures; the governments of the aggressor countries and those of the accomplice countries will bear the consequences arising therefrom.

These two similar notes were delivered by Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko to the Turkish Chargé d'Affaires ad interim in the Soviet Union, Batu, and the Pakistani Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Aga Hilaly, respectively.

The note pointed out that the US plane that intruded into Soviet airspace on May 1st with hostile intent for military reconnaissance was based at Incirlik Air Base near Adana, Turkey, a joint US-Turkish air base. On April 27th, it flew from there to Peshawar Airport in Pakistan, and then took off from Peshawar Airport to intrude into Soviet territory. According to the confession of the captured American spy pilot Powers, he served in the US 10-10 unit, which is stationed in Turkey and engages in high-altitude military reconnaissance. He had flown along the Turkish-Soviet border more than once in order to reconnoiter the Soviet radar air defense network.

The note said that the Soviet government cannot ignore the role played by Turkey and Pakistan in preparing and carrying out this hostile action against the Soviet Union, because the intruding US plane was based on Turkish territory, passed through Pakistan, and prepared its flight there.

The Soviet government deems it necessary to declare to the governments of Turkey and Pakistan that by providing their territory to the United States for the establishment of military bases, allowing American planes to carry out aggressive actions against the Soviet Union, they have become accomplices in such actions and thus bear serious responsibility for the dangerous consequences that may arise from such behavior.

The Soviet government has repeatedly warned the governments of Turkey and Pakistan about the danger of their providing their territory to other countries as military bases. However, Turkey and Pakistan have not heeded these warnings from the Soviet Union, which were motivated by concern for maintaining peace and improving relations with these two countries.

The note concluded by emphasizing: "The Soviet Union possesses weapons that can completely eliminate military bases from which aggressive actions are carried out against the Soviet Union, if necessary. It goes without saying that not only the governments of those countries that commit aggression against other countries, but also the governments of countries that are accomplices in such aggression, should be responsible for the consequences."

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 14th: The Soviet government protested to the Norwegian government regarding Norway's provision of an airport for US military planes intruding into the Soviet border.

This note was delivered to the Norwegian Ambassador to Moscow, Gundersen, on May 13th by Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko.

The note pointed out that the American plane that violated the Soviet border and intruded into Soviet airspace on May 1st was headed towards Bodø Airport in Norway.

The note recalled that as early as January 1959, after receiving reliable reports about the deliberate flight of American military planes from Norway (precisely from Bodø Airport) to Soviet territory for military reconnaissance, the Soviet government had declared to the Norwegian government that such a situation was unacceptable.

The note said that now the intended landing point for the American plane that made a provocative flight over Soviet territory was still Bodø Airport in Norway, which irrefutably shows that the Norwegian government did not heed the warnings of the Soviet government. The note pointed out that Norway has in fact become a participant in the provocative activities carried out by the United States against Norway's neighbor, the Soviet Union.

The Soviet government warned that if similar provocations occur again from Norwegian territory, then the Soviet government will be forced to take appropriate countermeasures. The governments of countries that commit aggression against other countries, as well as the governments of countries that participate in such aggression, will be responsible for the consequences.

### 苏联抗议土耳其、巴基斯坦和挪威为侵苏美机提供基地  充当美国侵略同谋将承担严重后果

    苏联抗议土耳其、巴基斯坦和挪威为侵苏美机提供基地
    充当美国侵略同谋将承担严重后果
    新华社14日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科13日讯：苏联政府在13日分别照会土耳其和巴基斯坦政府，就土巴两国为侵犯苏联领空的美国飞机提供基地一事提出严重抗议。照会强调指出：如果类似的侵略行为再次发生，苏联政府将不得不采取对策；侵略国政府和那些同谋国政府都要承担由此而产生的后果。
    这两份内容相似的照会已由苏联外交部长葛罗米柯分别交给土耳其驻苏联临时代办巴图和巴基斯坦驻苏联大使阿加·希拉里。
    照会指出，5月1日抱有军事侦察的敌意目的侵入苏联领空的美国飞机是以土耳其亚达那市附近的美—土空军基地英季利克为基地，4月27日从那里飞到巴基斯坦的白沙瓦机场，然后由白沙瓦机场起飞侵入苏联国境。据被捕获的美国间谍飞行员鲍尔士供认，他在美国10—10部队供职，这支部队驻扎在土耳其，从事高空军事侦察，他不止一次地沿着土耳其—苏联边界飞行，以便侦察苏联的雷达防空网。
    照会说，苏联政府不能无视土耳其和巴基斯坦在准备和实现这一对苏联的敌对行动时所起的作用，因为进犯的美国飞机就是以土耳其的领土为基地，经过巴基斯坦并在那里准备它的飞行的。
    苏联政府认为有必要向土耳其和巴基斯坦两国政府声明：土耳其和巴基斯坦政府把自己的领土提供给美国设置军事基地，让美国飞机对苏联进行侵略行动，这样，它们就成为这种行动的同谋者，从而对这种行为可能发生的危险后果负有严重责任。
    苏联政府前曾多次就土耳其和巴基斯坦把自己的领土提供给别国作为军事基地这种情况的危险性警告过两国政府。但是，土耳其和巴基斯坦并没有注意到苏联出于对维护和平的关怀和改善同这两个国家的关系的愿望而提出的这些警告。
    照会最后强调说：“苏联拥有可以在必要时完全消灭对苏联进行侵略行动的军事基地的武器。不言而喻，不仅是侵略别国的那些国家的政府，而且这种侵略的同谋国家的政府都应该对所产生的后果负责。”
    新华社14日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科14日讯：苏联政府照会挪威政府就挪威为侵犯苏联国境的美国军用飞机提供机场一事提出抗议。
    这份照会是在13日由苏联外交部长葛罗米柯交给挪威驻莫斯科大使贡德森的。
    照会指出，5月1日侵犯苏联边界并侵入苏联领空的美国飞机的航向是挪威的布德机场。
    照会追述说，还在1959年1月，苏联政府在收到关于从挪威（也正是从布德机场）起飞的美国军用飞机蓄谋到苏联领土进行军事侦察的飞行的可靠的报告之后，就曾向挪威政府宣布，这种状况是不能容许的。
    照会说，而现在在苏联领土上空挑衅性飞行的美国飞机的预定着陆地点依然是挪威的布德机场，这就不可辩驳地说明，挪威政府没有听取苏联政府的警告。照会指出，实际上挪威成了美国对挪威的邻居——苏联进行的挑衅活动的参加者。
    苏联政府警告说，如果从挪威领土上再发生类似挑衅，那末，苏联政府将被迫采取应有的对策。对其他国家进行侵略的国家的政府以及参与这种侵略的国家的政府将为其后果承担责任。
