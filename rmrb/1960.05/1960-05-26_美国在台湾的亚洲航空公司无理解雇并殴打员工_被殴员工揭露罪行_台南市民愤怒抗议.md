Xinhua News Agency, May 25th, Taipei Dispatch: Recently, twenty-seven Taiwanese employees in Tainan City held a press conference, accusing the American aggressors' "Asia Airlines" in Taiwan of withholding owed wages, beating employees, and unjustifiably firing them. The exposure of these evil deeds by the Americans has aroused protests from the citizens of Tainan.

The Taiwan "China Evening News" reported that on April 25th, Asia Airlines employees Gao Deshuo and twenty-six others went to the residence of Vice Manager Weisi Ti (an American) to demand the payment of wages for the first half of April. Weisi Ti not only rudely refused but also acted like a gangster, arbitrarily insulting and assaulting them, resulting in injuries to employees Cai Jianhai and Zeng Binghui. At the same time, the company forced these employees to resign or take unpaid leave, and before formally dismissing them, they published a statement in the newspaper declaring that the airport passes of Gao Deshuo, Cai Jianhai, Zeng Binghui, and the other twenty-four were invalid, preventing them from entering the workplace. This incident aroused protests from other Taiwanese workers in the Tainan factory of "Asia Airlines" against the American aggressors. The struggle is still ongoing.

A Taipei dispatch says that the chairman of "Asia Airlines" is former U.S. Pacific Fleet Commander Admiral Stump. Many of the company's senior staff are thugs and villains from the United States. They are frequently engaged in smuggling, tax evasion, and drug trafficking in Taiwan and Southeast Asia, and cruelly exploit the Taiwanese workers in the company. (Attached picture)

    美国在台湾的亚洲航空公司无理解雇并殴打员工
    被殴员工揭露罪行　台南市民愤怒抗议
    新华社25日讯　台北消息：最近在台南市有二十七名台湾员工举行了一次记者招待会，指责美国侵略者在台湾开办的“亚洲航空公司”扣发积欠工资，殴打职工，并且无理解雇的罪行。美国人的这种恶行被揭露后，激起了台南市民的抗议。
    台湾“中国晚报”说，4月25日，亚洲航空公司员工高德硕等二十七人到公司副经理魏思梯（美国人）住所，要求发给4月份上半月工资，魏思梯不但蛮横拒绝，而且大耍流氓手段，肆意辱骂并且动手打人，员工蔡建海、曾炳辉因而受伤。同时，公司还强迫这些员工解雇或者自动请停薪假，并且在未正式解雇之前，就登报声明说高德硕、蔡建海、曾炳辉等二十七人的进入机场的通行证作废，迫使他们不能进入工作场所。这一事件引起了“亚洲航空公司”台南工场里其他台湾工人对美国侵略者的抗议。现在，斗争仍在继续进行。
    台北消息说，“亚洲航空公司”的董事长是前美国太平洋舰队总司令斯图普上将。公司里许多高级职员都是从美国来的流氓恶棍。在台湾和东南亚各地经常从事走私漏税，贩运毒品的勾当，并且对公司里的台湾工人进行着残酷的剥削。（附图片）
