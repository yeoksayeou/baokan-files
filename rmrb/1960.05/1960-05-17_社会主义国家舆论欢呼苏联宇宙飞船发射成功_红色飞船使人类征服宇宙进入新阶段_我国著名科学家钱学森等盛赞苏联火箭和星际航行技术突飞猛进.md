Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The news of the Soviet Union's launch of a satellite-type spaceship has excited scientific circles in China. Institutes such as the Institute of Mechanics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Geophysics, and the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics have held symposiums. Relevant scientists have given high praise to this great achievement of Soviet science.

    Mechanics expert Qian Xuesen said that the Soviet spaceship has gone into space, entering a nearly circular satellite orbit with an altitude of about 320 kilometers. The total weight of this spaceship is 4,540 kilograms, more than double that of the satellite two years ago. The previous satellite could not be controlled from the ground, while this spaceship can receive signals from the ground, detach a part of the ship—a 2.5-ton sealed cabin—from the rest of the ship, and, according to ground commands, use a braking small rocket with a thrust direction opposite to the direction of motion to reduce its flight speed, causing the sealed cabin to descend. These circumstances fully demonstrate that Soviet rocket technology and interstellar navigation technology have made leaps and bounds in the past two years. In contrast, the American imperialists are desperately increasing military appropriations, concentrating their efforts on rockets; but the weight of their largest successful satellite, "Discoverer," is less than one-thirty-third of the Soviet spaceship. This is a stark contrast.

    The significance of the Soviet launch of a giant spaceship is: this is the first rehearsal of a manned spaceship, a flight test of all the necessary equipment for a manned spaceship. The next stage will be to send people into satellite orbit, and then have people fly in orbit and safely land back on the surface of the Earth. Qian Xuesen said: Going to interstellar space means going to an environment completely different from what we humans are accustomed to; and not only we humans are unaccustomed to it, but all past and present life on Earth will also be unaccustomed to it, because none of them have been to interstellar space; therefore, interstellar space is unfamiliar to us humans and the entire biological world. To step out of the Earth's door, we must study the environment outside the door and the impact of this new environment on our human physiology. The series of high-altitude rocket probes, artificial Earth satellites, and spaceship launches that the Soviet Union has carried out for many years have all been for this purpose: to detect the gas composition, pressure, ion and electron concentration, cosmic ray intensity, and the density of meteors and micrometeors in the upper atmosphere and interstellar space, and used biological experiments, including dogs, to study the reaction of organisms in the new environment. All this is in preparation for humans to go to space.

    This time, although the Soviet Union's launch of a spaceship is not the manned test mentioned above, it is a rehearsal for manned testing, bringing us the great prospect of a new stage in satellite navigation!

    Geophysicist Zhao Jiuzhang said that the success of this Soviet spaceship launch shows that the work of conquering the universe has made great progress, and the time for humans to enter outer space is closer. For humans to fly into outer space, several important problems must be solved: first, the spaceship must have a certain large volume so that humans can survive during the journey; second, accurate measurement of orbital parameters, rapid calculation of orbital parameters, and precise orbital control must be achieved. Only by achieving this goal can humans accurately know their location on the spaceship and use automatic control and ground control to navigate and master the flight path; third, the problem of returning to Earth, there must be a deceleration device, such as a reverse jet device, so that the spaceship will not have too high a speed and generate high temperatures due to air friction when flying at low altitudes, causing the ship to burn up. According to the Soviet TASS communique, the Soviet Union has solved or is close to solving these three aspects. This flight is a test flight for humans to conquer outer space in the near future.

    Zhao Jiuzhang also said that it is worth noting the rapid development of Soviet rocket jet technology. The weight of the last stage of the previous Soviet space rockets and Pacific missiles was about 1.5 tons, but in less than half a year, the weight of the warhead has increased threefold. According to general calculations, to send such a heavy spacecraft, the thrust of the rocket must reach more than 4,000 tons. From this, it can be inferred that the Soviet Union has made outstanding new contributions in rocket fuel and engines.

    Automation expert Lu Yuanjiu, astronomer Cheng Maolan, Tsinghua University Department of Automatic Control Director and Professor Zhong Shimo, and Beijing Normal University Physics Department Astronomy Teaching and Research Section Lecturer Feng Kejia, all believe that the Soviet Union's successful launch of a satellite-type spaceship has made great contributions to the complex technology of humans flying into outer space and returning to Earth.

    Scientists in Shanghai hailed the Soviet Union's successful launch of a satellite-type spaceship. The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences held a symposium today for this purpose. Feng Depei, Vice President of the Branch and Director of the Institute of Physiology, said at the symposium: This time, the Soviet Union successfully launched a satellite-type spaceship weighing more than 4,500 kilograms, and it can descend according to human commands, which shows that the Soviet Union has made new great achievements in solving space flight technology.

    Zhang Xiangtong, member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wang Yinglai, Director of the Institute of Biochemistry, Xu Jinghua, Associate Researcher of the Institute of Physiology, and others emphasized the great significance of the Soviet Union's launch of a giant satellite-type spaceship.

    This newspaper’s comprehensive report, according to Xinhua News Agency: After the good news of the Soviet Union's successful launch of a satellite-type spacecraft spread, it aroused enthusiastic reactions from the people of various fraternal countries. They are proud of the new achievements of the Soviet elder brother in science and technology and enthusiastically cheer for the victory of our vibrant socialist system.

    Bai Nanyun, President of the Korean Academy of Sciences, extended warm congratulations to Soviet scientists and all the Soviet people for their new achievements in conquering the universe. He said that the Soviet Union is far ahead of the United States. This spaceship is the glorious result of the struggle of the Soviet people living under the socialist system. This clearly proves the superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system, and it also proves that the forces of peace and socialism greatly exceed the forces of imperialist war.

    Professor Popovich, Director of the Astrophysics and Artificial Satellite Department of the Bucharest Observatory in Romania, said that the first spaceship launched by the Soviet Union to prepare for manned spaceflight is so highly precise that it is truly remarkable. The weight of the satellite-type spaceship, the possibility of controlling the spaceship and the sealed cabin - these are new, unique factors and outstanding achievements.

    B. Fov, Corresponding Academician of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences and Director of the Sofia Observatory, said that this is a new victory for the genius of the Soviet people, who are achieving one victory after another in science. The launch of the spaceship vividly demonstrates the high achievements of Soviet science.

    On the 16th, newspapers and periodicals in Eastern European fraternal countries published articles praising the achievements of the Soviet Union in launching satellite-type spaceships. The Bulgarian "Workers' Cause" published a commentary entitled "Soviet Spaceship in the Universe." The Czechoslovak "Red Rights" prominently published the news and reactions to this major event. The Polish "People's Forum" reported the news in detail on the front page with the title "New Achievements of Soviet Scientists, the World is on the Eve of Human Flight to the Universe," and published a commentary. The German Democratic Republic's "New Germany" prominently published the news of the Soviet Union's launch of a spaceship and the reactions from all walks of life.

    社会主义国家舆论欢呼苏联宇宙飞船发射成功
    红色飞船使人类征服宇宙进入新阶段
    我国著名科学家钱学森等盛赞苏联火箭和星际航行技术突飞猛进
    新华社16日讯　苏联发射卫星式宇宙飞船的消息振奋了我国科学界。中国科学院力学研究所、地球物理研究所、北京航空学院等单位都举行了座谈会。有关的科学家对苏联科学的这一伟大成就都给予很高的评价。
    力学家钱学森说，苏联的宇宙飞船上了天，进入了高度约为三百二十公里接近圆形的卫星轨道。这次宇宙飞船总重量是四千五百四十公斤，比起两年前的卫星来，增加了两倍还多；那一次的卫星是不能从地面控制的，而这次的宇宙飞船可以接收地面上的信号，把船体的一部分——约两吨半重的密封舱与船体其它部分脱开，并根据地面上的命令，用推力方向与运动方向相反的制动小火箭减低飞行速度，使密封舱下降。这些情况充分说明了苏联的火箭技术和星际航行技术，两年来有了飞跃的进步。与这对比，美帝国主义者们拼命地增加军事拨款，集中力量搞火箭；但他们发射成功的最大卫星“发现者”的重量还不到苏联宇宙飞船的三十三分之一，这是多么鲜明的对比。
    苏联发射巨型宇宙飞船的意义是：这是第一次载人宇宙飞船的预演，是对于一切载人宇宙飞船必要装备的飞行检验；下一阶段将是人飞上卫星轨道，将是人在轨道上飞行之后又安全地降落到地球表面上来。钱学森说：人到星际空间去是到一个完全不同于我们人类所习惯的环境中去；而且不但我们人不习惯，一切地球上过去和现在的生物也不会习惯，因为它们都没有到过星际空间；因此星际空间对我们人类和整个生物界都是陌生的。要跨出地球的大门，我们必要研究大门外的环境和这个新环境对我们人体生理的影响。苏联多年以来所进行的一系列高空火箭探测、人造地球卫星以及宇宙火箭的发射都是为了这个目的：探测高层空间和星际空间的气体组成、压力、离子和电子浓度、宇宙射线强度、流星和微流星的密度等，并且用了包括狗在内的生物作实验，研究生物在新环境下的反应。这一切都是为了人能上天作准备。
    这一次苏联发射宇宙飞船，虽然还不是上面所说的载人试验，但它是载人试验的预演，它给我们带来了卫星航行新阶段的伟大前景！
    地球物理学家赵九章说，苏联这一次宇宙飞船发射的成功，表明征服宇宙的工作又得到巨大的进展，人类进入宇宙空间的时间也就更接近了一步；要人类飞往宇宙空间，必须解决几个重要问题：第一，是飞船必须有一定大的体积，这样才能使人类在航行中得以生存；第二，是精确的轨道参数测量，快速的轨道参数计算和精确的轨道控制，能够达到了这个目标，人类才能在宇宙飞船上准确地知道所在的位置，并通过自动控制及地面控制来导航以掌握飞行的航线；第三是重返大地问题，必须有减速装置，例如反方向的喷气的装置，这样才能够使宇宙飞船在飞到低空时，不致速度太高和空气摩擦产生高温而使飞船焚毁。根据苏联塔斯社的公报看来，苏联在这三个方面都已解决或接近于解决。这次飞行正是为不久的将来人类征服宇宙空间作的一次试飞。
    赵九章又说，值得注意的是苏联火箭喷气技术的突飞猛进。以前苏联所发射的几个宇宙火箭及太平洋导弹，最后一级的重量是一吨半左右，现在还不到半年的时间内，弹头的重量已飞增了三倍，按照一般的计算，送出这样重的飞船，火箭的推力要达到四千吨以上。从这些可以推算苏联在火箭燃料和发动机上，都有突出的新的贡献。
    自动化专家陆元九、天文学家程茂兰、清华大学自动控制系主任、教授钟士模同北京师范大学物理系天文教研室讲师冯克嘉等，都认为苏联成功地发射了卫星式宇宙飞船，对人类飞往宇宙空间和重返地球的复杂技术，做出了极大的贡献。
    上海市的科学家们同声欢呼苏联发射卫星式宇宙飞船上天。中国科学院上海分院今天为此举行了座谈会。分院副院长、生理研究所所长冯德培在座谈会上说：这次苏联成功地发射了卫星式宇宙飞船，重量达到四千五百多公斤，而且可以按人的指挥下降，这说明苏联在解决宇宙飞行技术上又有了新的伟大的成就。
    中国科学院学部委员张香桐、生物化学研究所所长王应睐、生理研究所副研究员徐京华等在讲话中强调指出苏联这次发射巨型卫星式宇宙飞船上天的重大意义。
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：当苏联成功发射卫星式飞船的喜讯传出后，引起各兄弟国家人民的热烈的反应。他们为苏联老大哥在科学技术上的新成就感到骄傲，为我们充满活力的社会主义制度的胜利热情欢呼。
    朝鲜科学院院长白南云对苏联科学家和全体苏联人民在征服宇宙中的新成就表示热烈的祝贺。他说，苏联正远远地在美国前面前进。这个飞船是生活在社会主义制度中的苏联人民斗争的光辉成果，这清楚地证明了社会主义对资本主义制度的优越性，同时也证明，和平和社会主义的力量大大超过了帝国主义战争的力量。
    罗马尼亚布加勒斯特天文台天体物理学和人造卫星部主任波波维奇教授说，苏联发射用来准备使人飞入宇宙空间的第一个宇宙飞船是这样的高度精确，是真正了不起的。卫星式飞船的重量、对飞船和密封舱进行控制的可能性——这都是新的、绝无仅有的因素和卓越的成就。
    保加利亚科学院通讯院士、索非亚天文台台长鲍?夫说，这是苏联人天才的新的胜利，苏联人在科学上获得了一个接一个的胜利。发射宇宙飞船鲜明地显示了苏联科学高度的成就。
    东欧各兄弟国家报刊16日纷纷发表文章赞誉苏联发射卫星式飞船的成就。保加利亚“工人事业报”以“苏联飞船在宇宙中”为题发表了评论。捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”以显著地位刊登了这一重大事件的消息和反应。波兰“人民论坛报”以“苏联科学家的新成就，世界处于人类飞往宇宙的前夕”为题在第一版详细报道了这一消息，并且发表了评论。德意志民主共和国“新德意志报”以重要地位刊登了苏联发射宇宙飞船的消息和各界反应。
