Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 20th: From this morning, people from all walks of life in Japan have launched a massive movement to smash the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet, and dissolve the Diet.

　　In Tokyo, a total of 100,000 people braved the torrential rain today to protest the Kishi Nobusuke group's fascist means of forcibly "passing" the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty in the House of Representatives.

　　Demonstrators submitted petitions to the Socialist Party and the Communist Party, declaring the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" "passed" by the House of Representatives invalid and demanding the dissolution of the Diet.

　　Workers, students, women, religious figures, and representatives from all over the country, holding umbrellas and red flags, flocked to the Diet building from early this morning. They shouted: "Stop the ratification of the new Security Treaty!" "Dissolve the Diet!" "Down with the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet!"
  "Down with war criminal Kishi Nobusuke!" "Down with Japan's Syngman Rhee!"

　　Many students also broke into Kishi Nobusuke's official residence today to protest to him. Some students climbed over the wall and fought with the police who were blocking them. According to reports, Kishi Nobusuke was so frightened that he secretly slipped away from the back door. Only the Chief Cabinet Secretary was left in the residence. According to statistics, eight students were arrested, and a total of 250 people were injured on both sides.

　　At 6 p.m., 15,000 people held a "National Assembly to Stop the Ratification of the Security Treaty, Demand the Resignation of the Kishi Cabinet, and Demand the Dissolution of the Diet" at the Hibiya Park Open-Air Concert Hall.

　　The assembly passed a resolution saying that they would launch a petition and signature campaign demanding the dissolution of the Diet until the Diet was dissolved. On May 26, assemblies and protests will be held, centered on the Joint Struggle Council of Anti-"Security Treaty" Regions across the country.

　　The resolution also said that protests should be lodged with Kishi Nobusuke every day by telegram, telephone, letter, and other means.

　　The assembly also issued a declaration stating that it would not recognize the illegal vote on the "Security Treaty."

　　The declaration said: The Kishi Nobusuke government and the Liberal Democratic Party introduced right-wing violent groups and police into the Diet at midnight on the 19th, forcibly extended the meeting period, and only a portion of the members voted on the Security Treaty. We will fight until the entire Kishi Nobusuke government, which has so undermined democracy, is forced to resign and the Diet is dissolved.

　　At the meeting, Socialist Party Chairman Inejiro Asanuma and Communist Party Central Committee Cadre Presidium member Sanzo Nosaka delivered speeches in sharp tones, saying, "We absolutely do not recognize the 'Security Treaty' revised by the Kishi Cabinet through violence."

　　Then, Socialist Party member Minoru Tanaka reported on the situation in the Diet and pointed out that as long as the Japan-U.S. security system remains in place and Japan's subordination to the United States is not eliminated, we must persist in the just struggle for national freedom and peace.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 20th: After learning that the Kishi Nobusuke group had forcibly "passed" the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" through violence, more than 10,000 angry people in Tokyo immediately held a sit-down demonstration on the roads around the Japanese Diet at 2 a.m. today to express their strong protest.

　　Japanese Communist Party Chairman Sanzo Nosaka issued a call to the demonstrators, saying, "Dear workers, you must now hold a large-scale political general strike to smash the revised 'Security Treaty.' This is a weapon that only workers can use, and the Liberal Democrats cannot use this weapon. From now on, we should concentrate our efforts on preparing for a general strike."

　　"Let us carry the struggle to the end. Let us make Kishi Nobusuke follow in the footsteps of Tojo and Syngman Rhee."

　　The crowd expressed warm support for his speech with thunderous applause and cheers.

　　Former Chairman of the Japanese Socialist Party, Mosaburo Suzuki, emphasized, "A large-scale struggle against the 'Security Treaty' must also be carried out." He emphasized, "Let us bring back the democracy that has been trampled on by the Liberal Democratic Party to our side."

　　Saburo Eda, Minoru Tanaka, Yoshio Shiga, and other leaders of the Socialist Party and the Communist Party all called on the people to immediately step up the struggle to overthrow Kishi Nobusuke.

　　Saburo Osawa, leader of the Tokyo Regional Council of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, said that the Japanese people will never regard the arbitrariness of the ruling party as having any value. He emphasized that massive petitions and political strikes by workers should be carried out with unprecedented strength.

　　The workers and students holding the sit-down demonstration shouted, "We will use a general strike to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke government." A group of national railway workers shouted, "We will not run trains today." The workers and students enthusiastically encouraged the railway workers.

　　Three thousand students held a wave-like demonstration, shouting: "Down with the Kishi Nobusuke government." (Attached picture)

    日本人民决不承认日美军事同盟
    东京十万人集会宣布条约无效
    工人学生在国会周围高呼打倒岸信介
    新华社20日讯　东京消息：日本各界人民从今天早晨开始展开了声势浩大的粉碎日美军事同盟条约、打倒岸信介内阁、解散国会的运动。
    在东京，今天共有十万人冒着倾盆大雨举行了抗议岸信介集团施用法西斯手段强使众议院“通过”日美军事同盟条约的暴行。
    示威群众向社会党和共产党提交了请愿书，宣布众议院“通过”的新日美“安全条约”无效，并要求解散国会。
    工人、学生、妇女、宗教界人士以及来自各地的代表，从今天早晨起打着雨伞，高举着红旗，络绎不绝地奔向国会大厦。他们高呼：“阻止批准新安全条约！”“解散国会！”“打倒岸信介内阁！”
  “打倒战犯岸信介！”“打倒日本的李承晚！”
    许多学生今天还闯入岸信介的官邸，向他提出抗议，一部分学生爬过墙同阻拦他们的警察殴打起来。有消息说，岸信介吓得已经偷偷地从后门蹓走。住宅里只剩下内阁官房长官一个人。据统计，有八名学生被捕，双方共有二百五十人受伤。
    下午六点，一万五千人在日比谷公园露天音乐堂举行了“阻止批准安全条约、要求岸内阁总辞职和要求解散国会国民大会”。
    大会通过了一项决议说，要展开要求解散国会的请愿和签名运动，一直到解散国会为止。在5月26日以全国各地的反对“安全条约”地区共同斗争会议为中心，举行集会和抗议斗争。
    决议还说，每天要用电报、电话、写信等方式向岸信介提出抗议。
    大会还发表宣言说，对于违法的“安全条约”的表决，不予以承认。
    宣言说：岸信介政府和自由民主党在19日午夜把右翼暴力团和警察引进国会，强行延长会议期间，仅由一部分议员表决了安全条约。我们要进行斗争，直到迫使如此破坏了民主的岸信介政府全体辞职并解散国会的时候为止。
    在会上社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎、共产党中央干部会委员龄木市藏以激烈的口吻致词说：“我们绝对不承认岸内阁用暴力进行修改的‘安全条约’。”
    接着，社会党议员田中稔男报告国会情况并致词指出，只要日美安全体制依然存在，日本从属于美国的关系不消除，就要坚持争取民族自由和和平的正义斗争。
    新华社20日讯　东京消息：在获悉岸信介集团用暴力强使众议院“通过”日美“安全条约”后，东京一万多名愤怒的群众在今天清晨两时立即在日本国会周围的大路上举行静坐示威表示强烈的抗议。
    日本共产党主席野坂参三向示威群众发出号召说，“亲爱的工人们，你们现在必须举行大规模的政治总罢工来粉碎修改了的‘安全条约’。这是只有工人们能够使用的武器，而自由民主党人不能使用这种武器。从现在起，我们应该集中力量来准备总罢工。”
    “让我们把斗争进行到底。让我们使岸信介蹈东条和李承晚的复辙吧。”
    群众用暴风雨般的掌声和欢呼声表示热烈支持他的讲话。
    日本社会党前委员长铃木茂三郎强调说，“还必须进行大规模的反对‘安全条约’的斗争。”他强调说，“让我们把被自由民主党蹂躏的民主挽回到我们这方面来吧。”
    江田三郎、田中稔男和志贺义雄等社会党和共产党的领导人都号召人民立即加紧打倒岸信介的斗争。
    日本工会总评议会东京地方评议会的领导人大泽三郎说，日本人民决不把执政党的专横行动看作是有任何价值的。他强调指出，应该以空前强大的力量来进行规模巨大的请愿以及工人的政治罢工。
    举行静坐示威的工人和学生高呼“我们要用总罢工来推翻岸信介政府”。一批国营铁道工人高呼“我们今天将不开火车”。工人们和学生们热烈鼓励铁道工人。
    三千名学生举行了波浪形示威游行，他们高呼：“打倒岸信介政府”。（附图片）
