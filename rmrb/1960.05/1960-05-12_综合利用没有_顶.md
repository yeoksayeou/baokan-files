Local Newspaper Commentary:

    Comprehensive Utilization Has No "Top"
    Some comrades believe that in the continuous Great Leap Forward of the past two years, great achievements have been made in comprehensive utilization, and there are not many things left that can be comprehensively utilized. This "reached the top" mentality is very unscientific and backward. In fact, we still have many materials that can be utilized but have not been. Fifteen tons of toluene chlorosulfonic acid are used as raw materials to produce only one ton of saccharin; several tons of raw materials such as coal and pig iron are used to refine one ton of steel. So, where did the other several tons of material go? According to the principle of "conservation of matter," these things will never vanish into thin air. With the development of science and technology, especially the chemical industry, the uses of many things are becoming wider and wider. Therefore, compared to the infinite resources of nature, our existing achievements in comprehensive utilization are not worth complacency at all. In comprehensive utilization, there is fundamentally no "top" to reach, let alone the idea that we have already "reached the top."
    To achieve greater success in the comprehensive utilization of raw materials, we must continue to implement the spirit of the General Line and establish the ambition to conquer nature. Nature will not give people "gifts." We must extract wealth from nature. Without people's hard work, seawater is just seawater, sludge is just sludge, and coal is at most used as fuel. Therefore, the key lies in giving full play to people's subjective initiative, constantly promoting the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, boldly experimenting, boldly creating, constantly exploring, and constantly opening up new avenues for comprehensive utilization. In philosophy, our law is: "There are only things that have not yet been recognized, and there are no unknowable things." In comprehensive utilization, we can also say: "There are only things that have not yet been utilized by people and things that people do not yet know how to utilize, and there are no things that cannot be utilized." Through people's continuous practice, nature will be more tamely controlled by people, and the prospect of using all natural things to serve mankind is infinitely broad.

### 综合利用没有“顶”

    综合利用没有“顶”
    有些同志认为在连续两年大跃进中，在综合利用方面已取得很大成绩，可以综合利用的东西已经不多了。这种“到顶”思想是非常不科学的，落后的。实际上，我们还有许许多多可以利用的物资没有利用。用甲苯氯磺酸十五吨的原料只能生产一吨糖精，用煤、生铁等好几吨的原材料，才炼出一吨钢，那么，其他几吨物质到哪里去了呢？根据“物质不灭”的原理，这些东西决不会化为乌有。随着科学技术的发展，特别是化学工业的发展，许多东西的用途越来越广。因此，比起自然界的无穷富源来说，我们在综合利用方面已有的成就丝毫不值得自满。在综合利用方面，根本无“顶”可到，更不要说现在已经“到顶”了。
    要使原材料的综合利用获得更大成绩，就必须继续贯彻总路线的精神，树立征服自然的雄心壮志。大自然不会给人们以“恩赐”。必须向大自然索取财富。不经过人们的辛勤劳动，海水只不过是海水，污泥只不过是污泥，煤炭至多也不过是作为燃料而已。因此，关键还在于发挥人的主观能动作用，不断地发扬敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格，大胆试验，大胆创造，不断摸索，不断开辟综合利用的新的途径。在哲学上，我们的定律是：“只有尚未被认识之物，没有不可知之物”，在综合利用上，也可以说：“只有尚未被人们利用之物和人们还不知道如何利用之物，而没有不可能利用之物”。通过人们不断的实践，自然界将更驯服地被人们所控制，利用一切自然物为人类服务的前途是无限广阔的。
