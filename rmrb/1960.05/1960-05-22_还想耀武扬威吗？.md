    According to a Tokyo dispatch, the Japanese militarist navy began a "long-distance navigation exercise" on May 18, traversing the Pacific Ocean for more than two months, a voyage of more than 14,000 nautical miles. Five warships, leased from the United States and built by Japan itself, participated in the exercise, with 1,200 Japanese naval personnel trained by the United States taking part. These Japanese militarist warships departed from Tokyo, passing through Hawaii, heading to the west coast of the United States, once again flaunting their military power in the Pacific.
    What the reappearance of Japanese militarist warships in the Pacific means to the people of Asian countries is not difficult to understand. The people of Asia have fresh memories of the devastating disaster brought about by the Japanese imperialist navy cooperating with the army in launching wars of aggression in Asia. Now, facing Japanese imperialist warships in the Pacific, they obviously cannot remain indifferent. Today, Japanese militarism has been revived under the support of US imperialism, and former Japanese fascist soldiers who participated in the massacres of the people of Southeast Asian countries have once again become the backbone of the Japanese army, navy, and air force. Take a look at Ishiguro Susumu, the commander of this Japanese fleet currently sailing in the Pacific. He was one of the advisors to Yamamoto Isoroku, the commander of the Japanese Combined Fleet during the Pacific War. The people of Asian countries can see very clearly that the so-called US-Japan military alliance is a thorough military aggression alliance that directly threatens the peace and security of Asian countries.
    But listen, as this fleet led by Japanese fascist militarists appears in the Pacific for the first time since World War II, the Pacific is filled with raging waves, and the people of Asian countries, especially the Japanese people, have launched a great storm of struggle. This storm will engulf all the aggressive gunboats of US-Japanese imperialism that dare to bombard the people of Asia, and will sweep away the running dog of US imperialism, Nobusuke Kishi, and his ilk without a trace!

### 还想耀武扬威吗？

    还想耀武扬威吗？
    据东京消息，日本军国主义的海军从5月18日开始进行横渡太平洋的为时两个多月航程达一万四千多浬的“远洋航行练习”。参加航行练习的有美国租借的和日本自己建造的共五艘军舰，美国训练出来的一千二百名日本海军兵员参加了这次“练习”。这些日本军国主义的军舰从东京出发途经夏威夷，前往美国西海岸，它们又在太平洋上耀武扬威了。
    日本军国主义的军舰再度在太平洋上出现，对于亚洲各国人民来说，意味着什么，这是不难理解的。亚洲人民对于当年日本帝国主义的海军配合陆军在亚洲发动侵略战争而带来的一场惨重浩劫记忆犹新，现在面对着太平洋上日本帝国主义的军舰，显然不能无动于衷。今天，日本军国主义已经在美帝国主义的扶植下复活起来，曾经参加对东南亚各国人民大屠杀的日本法西斯旧军人已经重新成为日本陆海空三军的骨干。请看正在太平洋上远航的这支日本舰队的司令官石黑进，也就是太平洋战争时期日本联合舰队司令官山本五十六的谋士之一。亚洲各国人民可以看得很清楚，所谓日美军事同盟，就是这样一个彻头彻尾的军事侵略联盟，它直接威胁着亚洲各国的和平与安全。
    但是，听吧，当这支由日本法西斯军国主义者率领的舰队在第二次世界大战以后第一次出现在太平洋时，太平洋上怒浪滔天，亚洲各国人民，特别是日本人民掀起了伟大的斗争风暴。这风暴，将要吞没一切胆敢轰击亚洲人民的美日帝国主义的侵略炮舰，将要把美帝国主义的走狗岸信介之流卷得无影无踪！
