Xinhua News Agency, Qomolangma, May 27th: Three members of the young Chinese mountaineering team—Wang Fuzhou, Gonbu (Tibetan), and Qu Yinhua—collectively and safely reached the summit of the world's highest peak, Mount Qomolangma, at 4:20 AM Beijing time on May 25th, thus completing the unprecedented feat in human history of ascending its summit from the north face.

The Chinese mountaineering team's ascent of Mount Qomolangma began on March 25th of this year. In just two months, they reached the summit from the north slope, which Western mountaineering circles had always considered "insurmountable."

This time, the Chinese mountaineering team, led by China's renowned mountaineer and master of mountaineering, Shi Zhanchun, began with three acclimatization marches from March 25th, and then launched a surprise assault on the main peak during the fourth march. Throughout the climbing process, under the leadership of the Party, the team members displayed soaring revolutionary zeal, overcame numerous difficulties such as extreme high-altitude hypoxia and frigid temperatures of around minus 40 degrees Celsius, and demonstrated the spirit of collectivism and patriotism, uniting and helping each other, finally achieving a glorious victory.

Xinhua News Agency, Qomolangma, May 27th: A Xinhua News Agency reporter reports from the Chinese mountaineering team's base camp at 5,120 meters above sea level at the foot of Mount Qomolangma:

At 0:30 AM Beijing time on the 27th, the reporter received the good news from the camp at 6,400 meters above sea level on the north slope of Mount Qomolangma via the mountaineering team's radio transceiver: Chinese mountaineering team members Wang Fuzhou, Gonbu (Tibetan), and Qu Yinhua safely reached the summit of Mount Qomolangma, 8,882 meters above sea level, at 4:20 AM Beijing time on the 25th, creating an unprecedented achievement in the history of world mountaineering by conquering Mount Qomolangma from the north slope for the first time. On the 26th, the mountaineers had all safely returned to the camp at 7,007 meters above sea level, and on the 27th, they could return to the camp at 6,400 meters above sea level.

The Chinese mountaineering team arrived at the foot of Mount Qomolangma on March 19th of this year. Starting from March 25th, the heroic mountaineers braved blizzards, traversed steep glacial areas, crossed dangerous icefall and avalanche zones, scaled sharp and towering rocky cliffs, and after three high-altitude acclimatization marches, successively established well-equipped low-mountain and high-mountain camps at altitudes of 5,400, 5,900, 6,400, 7,007, 7,600, 8,100, and 8,300 meters above sea level on Mount Qomolangma. On May 17th, the mountaineers began their fourth march to seize the main peak. They set off from the base camp at 5,120 meters above sea level at the foot of the mountain, and after a week of arduous marching, they built the last high-mountain camp—the "assault camp"—at an altitude of 8,500 meters above sea level on Mount Qomolangma. The three victorious Chinese mountaineering team members set off from this camp at 9:30 AM Beijing time on May 24th to assault the main peak.

The ice, snow, jagged rocks, and unpredictable climate of Mount Qomolangma hinder people from exploring its secrets. In some countries, it is mentioned alongside "Antarctica" and "the Arctic" and is called the "Third Pole" of the Earth. In particular, on the north slope of Mount Qomolangma, extreme cold, extremely high-altitude winds, massive icefalls, avalanches, and towering rock walls pose a great threat to mountaineers. Foreign mountaineering teams climbed Mount Qomolangma from the north slope seven times in the eighteen years from 1921 to 1938, and each time they failed. The Chinese mountaineering team, with only five years of mountaineering history, reached the summit of Mount Qomolangma from the north route in just two months. (Attached picture)

### 人类第一次战胜珠穆朗玛峰北坡天险  我登山队登上世界最高峰  冒漫天风雪，跨陡滑冰川，翻巉岩峭壁，踏上拔海八八八二米顶峰

    人类第一次战胜珠穆朗玛峰北坡天险
    我登山队登上世界最高峰
    冒漫天风雪，跨陡滑冰川，翻巉岩峭壁，踏上拔海八八八二米顶峰
    新华社珠穆朗玛27日电　年轻的中国登山队的三名队员——王富洲、贡布（藏族）、屈银华，5月25日清晨北京时间四时二十分集体安全地登上了世界最高峰——拔海八千八百八十二米的珠穆朗玛峰，从而完成了人类历史上从珠穆朗玛峰北路攀上它的顶峰的创举。
    中国登山队这次攀登珠穆朗玛峰的活动，是从今年3月25日开始的，他们只用了两个月的时间，就从西方登山界一直认为是“无法超越的”北坡登到了它的顶部。
    中国登山队这次由我国著名的登山家、登山运动健将史占春率领，从3月25日开始先后经过三次适应性行军，到第四次行军时突击主峰。在登山过程中，队员们在党的领导下，发挥了冲天的革命干劲，克服了高山极度缺氧和摄氏零下四十度左右的严寒等重重困难，发扬了集体主义和爱国主义的精神，团结互助，彼此支援，终于取得了辉煌的胜利。
    新华社珠穆朗玛27日电　新华社记者从珠穆朗玛峰下拔海五千一百二十米的中国登山队大本营报道：
    27日北京时间零时三十分，记者从登山队大本营的无线电收发报机里，收到了从珠穆朗玛峰北坡拔海六千四百米的营地传来的喜讯：中国登山队队员王富洲、贡布（藏族）、屈银华在25日黎明北京时间四点二十分安全地登上了拔海八千八百八十二米的珠穆朗玛峰顶峰，在世界登山史上第一次创造了从北坡征服珠穆朗玛峰的空前成就。26日，登山队员都已经安全返抵拔海七千零七米的营地，27日他们可以回到拔海六千四百米的营地。
    中国登山队是在今年3月19日抵达珠穆朗玛山下的。从3月25日开始，英雄的登山队员们冒着漫天的风雪，踏过陡滑的冰川地带，穿过危险的冰崩和雪崩区域，翻过尖削突兀的岩石峭壁，经过三次高山适应性行军，先后在珠穆朗玛峰拔海五千四百、五千九百、六千四百、七千零七、七千六百、八千一百和八千三百米的高度，建立起设备优良的低山和高山营地。5月17日，登山队员们开始了第四次行军夺取主峰的战斗。他们从山下拔海五千一百二十米的大本营出发，经过一周的艰苦行军，又在珠穆朗玛峰拔海八千五百米的高度建成了最后一个高山营地——“突击营地”。获得胜利的这三名中国登山队队员，是5月24日北京时间九点半从这座营地出发突击主峰的。
    珠穆朗玛峰的冰雪、巉岩和变化无常的气候，阻碍着人们探测它的秘密，在世界有些国家，人们把它同“南极”和“北极”并提，称为地球上的“第三极”。特别是珠穆朗玛峰的北坡上，极度的严寒，特大的高空风，巨大的冰崩、雪崩和峥嵘的岩壁，对登山家们存在着巨大的威胁。外国的登山队从1921年到1938年的十八年中，曾经从珠穆朗玛峰北坡攀登了七次，每次都遭到了失败。而只有五年登山历史的中国登山队，仅用了两个月的时间，就从北路登上了珠穆朗玛峰的顶峰。（附图片）
