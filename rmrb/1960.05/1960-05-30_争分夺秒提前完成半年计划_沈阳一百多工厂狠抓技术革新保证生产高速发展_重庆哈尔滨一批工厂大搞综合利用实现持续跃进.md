Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, May 29th: By May 27th, one hundred and five factories in Shenyang City had already fulfilled their half-year state plans ahead of schedule and with overfulfillment. These include factories of significant national importance such as the Shenyang Standard Parts Factory and the Shenyang Blower Factory.

Among these factories that have completed their half-year state plans ahead of schedule, many are units that have completed all aspects of their targets – output value, production volume, quality, cost, and profits delivered to the state – very well. For example, the Shenyang Pharmaceutical Glass Factory comprehensively completed its half-year plan ahead of schedule by May 15th. Among them, the output of major products has completed more than 50% of the annual plan, the total output value has completed 101% of the annual plan, and the profits delivered to the state have completed 64% of the annual plan. The cost and product quality of comparable products have also reached and exceeded the state plan targets. By May 15th, the Shenyang Insulating Materials Factory had completed 66% of the total annual state plan for output value and 73.2% of the annual plan for output. The quality improved by 0.2% compared to the plan requirements. Compared with the same period last year, the factory's output value increased by 118.6%, the output increased by 112.7%, and labor productivity increased by 161%.

These factories, which have already completed their half-year state plans ahead of schedule, have not only extensively and deeply carried out technological innovation movements this year, but have also particularly strengthened management. Many factories have not only paid attention to grasping current production but also to preparing for the next month's work; not only grasping output value but also grasping output, quality, cost, and labor productivity. The Party committee of the Shenyang Acid-Resistant Materials Factory often educates employees to have a comprehensive view of completing the plan. The factory's leading cadres also go deep into the front lines of production to inspect by shifts and comprehensively grasp progress. The factory's half-year plan has been fully completed.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, May 29th: Fourteen factories in the Chongqing chemical industry system have already completed half of their annual plan ahead of schedule. These factories are Tianyuan Chemical Plant, Chongqing Pharmaceutical Factory, Zhongnan Rubber Factory, Chongqing Tire Factory, Chongqing Paint Factory, Xinmin Plastics Factory, and Changjiang Chemical Plant.

Since the beginning of this year, the factories under the Chongqing Chemical Industry Bureau, in view of the characteristics of a high proportion of manual operations, low production efficiency, and heavy production tasks, have launched a mass movement to deeply carry out technological innovation and technological revolution centered on "four modernizations." The development of this movement has rapidly changed the backward production conditions of various factories and powerfully guaranteed the completion of the state plans of various factories. After the Zhongnan Rubber Factory carried out the technological innovation and technological revolution movement, the entire production process of rubber processing, from batching, mixing, molding, to vulcanization, basically achieved mechanized and semi-mechanized production, and work efficiency increased by one to sixty times respectively. The factory had completed 52.98% of the annual state plan by May 24th. After the Chongqing Pharmaceutical Factory vigorously engaged in the "four modernizations" movement, six workshops in the factory achieved semi-mechanization and mechanization respectively by the end of March, and labor productivity increased by 3.7 times compared with the same period last year. By May 24th, the factory had completed the half-year state plan ahead of schedule by more than thirty days with an overfulfillment of 15.6%.

The supply of raw materials is the key to the sustained leap forward in chemical production. Many factories have launched a movement to comprehensively utilize raw materials and have mobilized the masses to engage in raw material production through self-reliance. Employees of the Tianyuan Chemical Plant have used waste gas and waste liquid from their own factory's production process to produce sixteen new products, some of which have been supplied to Xinmin Plastics Factory, Changjiang Chemical Plant, and pesticide factories for production use. The Chongqing Mold Factory vigorously engaged in comprehensive utilization and set up six small processing factories, which also produced some tools and raw materials for their own factory.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, May 29th: Five factories in Harbin City, including the Local State-Owned Power Machinery Factory, Xiangtai Internal Combustion Engine Factory, Automobile Parts Factory, Chemical General Factory, and Songjiang Cannery, had respectively overfulfilled the half-year state plan by May 28th.

From the beginning of the year, these factories, in view of the weak links in production, fully mobilized the masses to vigorously engage in technological innovation and technological revolution movements. Entering May, various factories pushed the technological innovation and technological revolution movement to a new stage of consolidation, promotion, and improvement, powerfully promoting the completion of the production plan. The Harbin Automobile Parts Factory summarized and promoted the innovation suggestions put forward by the masses, realizing forty-four major innovation projects, which greatly improved labor productivity. The factory not only completed the output and quality plans but also added four new products such as oil-water separators and intermediate gears. The employees of the Power Machinery Factory grasped the weak link of the casting workshop, which has a large proportion of manual operations, and vigorously engaged in the mechanization of manual operations. In just one month, five automatic lines, such as molding sand processing and fan blade processing, appeared, increasing the factory's production efficiency by 3.18 times.

In the technological revolution movement, various factories vigorously engaged in comprehensive utilization and diversified operations around the completion of the production plan, which played a great role in solving the problem of insufficient supply of raw materials. After the Harbin Chemical General Factory vigorously engaged in diversified operations, it has now produced more than thirty products, such as baking soda and potassium carbonate, which have solved the raw material needs after the increase in production. By the 27th, the factory had completed 74.4% of the annual plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, May 27th: The Yumen Petroleum Administration Bureau Geological Exploration Company completed the first half year drilling footage plan 43 days ahead of schedule and over 9%. The average monthly efficiency of the drilling rig reached 814 meters, realizing a sustained leap forward. (Attached picture)

    争分夺秒提前完成半年计划
    沈阳一百多工厂狠抓技术革新保证生产高速发展
    重庆哈尔滨一批工厂大搞综合利用实现持续跃进
    新华社沈阳29日电　沈阳市到5月27日止，已有一百零五个工厂提前超额完成了上半年国家计划。其中包括在全国占有重要地位的沈阳标准件厂、沈阳鼓风机厂等工厂。
    在这批提前完成上半年国家计划的工厂中，有不少是产值、产量、质量、成本、上交利润等各方面指标都完成得很突出的单位。像沈阳市药用玻璃厂到5月15日就已全面提前完成了上半年计划。其中，主要产品产量已完成全年计划50％以上，总产值完成全年计划101％，上交利润完成全年计划64％，可比产品成本和产品质量，也都达到和超过了国家计划指标。沈阳市绝缘材料厂到5月15日止，总产值完成了全年国家年计划66％，产量完成年计划73.2％，质量比计划要求提高了0.2％。和去年同期比较，这个厂产值提高了118.6％，产量提高了112.7％，劳动生产率增长了161％。
    这些已经提前完成上半年国家计划的工厂，今年以来不但广泛深入地开展了技术革新运动，而且都特别加强了管理工作。很多工厂不仅注意了抓当前生产，还注意狠抓下个月的准备工作；不仅抓产值，而且也抓产量、质量、成本、劳动生产率。沈阳市耐酸材料厂党委，经常教育职工要有全面完成计划的观点，厂的领导干部也深入生产第一线按班检查，全面抓进度。这个工厂的上半年计划已全面完成。
    新华社重庆29日电　重庆市化学工业系统已有十四个工厂，提前完成全年计划的一半。这些工厂是天原化工厂、重庆制药厂、中南橡胶厂、重庆轮胎厂、重庆油漆厂、新民塑料厂、长江化工厂等。
    重庆市化学工业局所属工厂，今年以来针对手工操作比重大、生产效率低和生产任务重的特点，发动群众深入开展了以“四化”为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动。这一运动的开展，迅速改变了各厂的生产落后面貌，有力地保证了各厂国家计划的完成。中南橡胶厂开展技术革新和技术革命运动后，橡胶加工的全部生产流程从配料、炼胶、成型到硫化，基本上实现了机械化、半机械化生产，工效分别提高了一倍到六十倍。全厂到5月24日就已完成了全年国家计划的52.98％。重庆制药厂大搞“四化”运动后，3月底全厂就有六个车间分别实现了半机械化、机械化，劳动生产率比去年同期提高三点七倍。全厂到5月24日止，提前三十多天超额15.6％完成了上半年的国家计划。
    原料材料的供应问题，是化工生产持续跃进的关键。许多工厂都开展了综合利用原料材料的运动，并且发动群众自力更生大搞原料材料生产。天原化工厂职工，利用自己工厂生产过程中的废气废液，制成了十六种新产品，有的产品已供应了新民塑料厂、长江化工厂、农药厂生产用。重庆模具厂大搞综合利用，办起了六个小型加工厂，也为自己工厂生产了部分工具和原料材料。
    新华社哈尔滨29日电　哈尔滨市地方国营动力机厂、祥泰内燃机厂、汽车零件厂、化工总厂和松江罐头厂五个工厂，到5月28日止，已经分别超额完成上半年国家计划。
    这些工厂在年初一开始，就针对生产上的薄弱环节，充分发动群众，大搞技术革新和技术革命运动。进入5月，各厂又把技术革新和技术革命运动推向巩固、推广、提高发展的新阶段，有力地推动了生产计划的完成。哈尔滨汽车零件厂，把群众提出的革新建议，加以总结、推广，实现了四十四项重大革新项目，大大提高了劳动生产率，全厂不仅完成了产量、质量计划，还增加了油水分离器、过桥轮等四种新产品。动力机厂职工抓住手工操作比重较大的铸造车间这一薄弱环节，大搞手工操作机械化，仅一个月就出现了型砂处理、风叶加工等五条自动线，使全厂生产效率提高了三点一八倍。
    在技术革命运动中，各厂围绕完成生产计划大搞综合利用和多种经营，对于解决原料材料供应不足的问题，起了很大作用。哈尔滨化工总厂大搞多种经营以后，目前已经生产出小苏打、碳酸钾等三十多种产品，解决了生产提高后所需要的原料材料，到27日，全厂已经完成全年计划的74.4％。
    据新华社兰州27日电　玉门石油管理局地质勘探公司提前四十三天超额9％完成了上半年钻井进尺计划。钻机月效率平均达到八百一十四米，实现了持续跃进。（附图片）
