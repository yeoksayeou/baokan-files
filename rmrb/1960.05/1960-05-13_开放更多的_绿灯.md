    Open More "Green Lights"
    In the days of the great technical revolution, many moving deeds emerged in our country of large factories helping small factories and general factories helping key factories. Recently, a machine factory in Wuhan City proposed the slogan "Open Green Lights for Collaborative Parts for Technical Innovation."
    The story goes like this: One day, in order to rush-produce parts for a technical innovation project, I went to this machine factory. I was quite familiar with this factory and had been there before to get parts. I knew their method for handling temporary jobs: if the customer needed it urgently, the dispatcher would stamp a large red "Express Item" mark on the temporary work order.
    This time, although I repeatedly explained that the part was urgently needed and asked them to treat it as an express item, the dispatcher just hummed and hawed, stamping it with an ordinary stamp. I got anxious, thinking he hadn't heard clearly or couldn't handle it temporarily. So I repeatedly requested it. But he smiled and said, "Don't worry, this stamp will do the trick!"
    Sure enough, I only waited a short while and the part was ready. When I went to the workshop to pick it up, I saw a banner on the wall that said, "Open Green Lights for Collaborative Parts for Technical Innovation!" Then I understood that the part in my hand had been rushed out through a series of "green lights."
    Opening "green lights" for collaborative parts for technical innovation seems like a small thing, but it profoundly reflects the spirit of great collaboration in our era. When sixty-one class brothers in Pinglu County were poisoned, the boatmen on the Yellow River, where "no night crossing" had been a tradition, opened "green lights" to rescue the class brothers. When twenty-nine public security officers in Makou were burned, railway stations and warehouse workers also raised "green lights." Thus, many lives on the verge of death were saved!
    Thanks to the Party for opening the "green light" of great collaboration for us, guiding us to improve every day. (Wuhan Wen Wen)

### 开放更多的“绿灯”

    开放更多的“绿灯”
    在大闹技术革命的日子里，我们国家出现了许许多多大厂帮小厂、一般工厂帮助重点工厂的动人事迹。最近，在武汉市的一家机器厂里，又提出了“为技术革新协作件开放绿灯”的口号。
    事情的经过是这样的，一天，为了赶制技术革新项目中的零件，我曾到这家机器厂去了一趟。我和这个厂挺熟，过去也曾去配过零件。我知道他们处理临时活路的办法：如果订户要得急，调度员就在临时施工单上加盖个“特急件”的大红戳记。
    而这次，我虽然再三说明这个零件急等着用，要求他们也把它当作特急件办理。可是，调度员却只管唔唔地答应着，盖的还是普通戳子。我急了，以为他没有听清楚或者暂时办不到。于是又再三要求。可是他笑了，只说：“放心好了，这个戳子可顶事哩！”
    果然，我只坐等了一回儿，零件就到手了。当我到车间去提货时，见墙上有这样一幅标语“为技术革新协作件开放绿灯！”这时我明白了，原来我手中的零件是在一道道“绿灯”中赶出来的。
    为技术革命协作件开放“绿灯”，看起来是件小事，然而它却深刻地反映了我们时代大协作的精神面貌。平陆县六十一个阶级弟兄中毒了，自古不夜渡的黄河上的艄公们，为抢救阶级弟兄开放了“绿灯”；马口二十九位公安人员烧伤了，火车站和仓库工作人员也曾“绿灯”高悬。于是，许多垂危的生命就这样被救活了！
    感谢党，为我们打开了大协作的“绿灯”，指引着我们天天向上。　                                 　（武汉温文）
