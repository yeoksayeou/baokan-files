Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd: Over one million people in Nanjing held an unprecedentedly large rally and demonstration on the afternoon of the 22nd, supporting the Soviet Union's just stance against US imperialist aggression.

Over 200,000 people attended a mass rally in Xin Jiekou Square in the city center. The four wide roads leading to the square were filled with crowds holding flags and signs. Fully armed militiamen stood at the forefront of the crowd; People's Liberation Army soldiers also participated in the meeting.

Among those attending the mass rally in Xin Jiekou Square were party and government leaders of Jiangsu Province and Nanjing City, heads of various democratic parties and people's organizations, and leaders of the PLA units stationed in Nanjing. Soviet experts who are helping our country's construction in Nanjing, and foreign guests from the Soviet Union, Poland and other countries who came to Nanjing for visits were also invited to attend the meeting.

Liu Shunyuan, Secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke first at the meeting, severely condemning US imperialism, the number one enemy of the people of the world, for its provocation against the Soviet Union and its sabotage of the Four-Power Summit. He said: People all over the world must fully expose the aggressive and war policies of US imperialism and strengthen the struggle against it in order to ease international tensions and safeguard world peace. The more thorough the exposure and the more resolute the struggle, the more isolated US imperialism will become, and the more guaranteed the cause of safeguarding world peace will be. His speech aroused round after round of applause and slogans from the demonstrators.

Speaking at the meeting afterward were Wu Yifang, representative of various democratic parties in Jiangsu Province and Nanjing City, Guo Yingqiu, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial and Nanjing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, Xie Kexi, representative of various people's organizations in Jiangsu Province and Nanjing City, and Guo Shaojiang, industrial labor model.

At the same time, rallies and parades of more than 10,000 people were held at the Xiaguan Railway Station, Zijinshan Road, Pukou and Xuanwu Lake Park, Yuhuatai Square, Mochou Lake, and in the towns of Jiangning, Jiangpu, and Liuhe counties under the jurisdiction of Nanjing City. Various factories, schools, and government agencies also listened to live broadcasts of the mass rally in Xin Jiekou Square and held mass meetings separately.

The people who participated in the rallies and demonstrations felt great anger at the aggressive crimes of US imperialism. Rong Jiantang, an old worker at the Gulou Vehicle Factory, said indignantly at the mass rally: In 1946, I personally witnessed US imperialism playing the trick of mediation on the one hand, and transporting large quantities of military supplies to China to support the Kuomintang reactionaries in fighting the civil war on the other. Now, US imperialism is talking about peace on the one hand and sending planes to invade the airspace of the Soviet Union and sabotage the Four-Power Summit on the other. We must never tolerate the criminal behavior of US imperialism.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 23rd: Eight hundred thousand people from all walks of life in Changchun City, Jilin Province, held an unprecedented parade and rally on the afternoon of the 22nd, resolutely supporting the Soviet Union's just stance against US imperialist aggression and opposing US imperialism's sabotage of the Four-Power Summit.

The meeting was held simultaneously in twenty-nine venues. From noon onwards, workers, students, government cadres, People's Liberation Army soldiers, fully armed militiamen, and citizens who participated in the demonstration and rally poured into the city center. In the fields in the suburbs and on the construction sites of reservoirs, crowds also gathered to hold demonstrations and parades. The people who participated in the demonstration parade could not suppress the anger in their hearts. Wei Guangqin, a water supply worker at Changchun Railway Station, crossed the Yalu River in 1951 and fought the American aggressors. He said: US imperialism is a group of jackals. Only by severely attacking them can we defend world peace. Zhang Caihuan, a female commune member of Qinghe People's Commune and director of the neighborhood residents' committee, whose son is studying at the Moscow Power Engineering Institute in the Soviet Union, recently sent a letter to her family introducing the Soviet people's protest against the provocations of US imperialism. She said to everyone during the parade: "The people of China and the Soviet Union are as close as brothers. We will not allow the American bandits to touch a single hair of the Soviet Union." In the ranks of the demonstration, the peace's staunch defenders--the Chinese People's Liberation Army's contingent were particularly eye-catching. Captain Zhai Shichang said: The Soviet Air Force severely attacked the invading American planes. They did a good job and hit the mark. If US imperialism is not reconciled and wants to compete, then complete destruction awaits them.

Party and government leaders of Jilin Province and Changchun City, leaders of the Jilin Garrison of the People's Liberation Army, heads of various people's organizations and local organizations of various democratic parties, as well as people's representatives of Jilin Province and CPPCC members who were attending the meeting in Changchun, all participated in the central venue of the meeting. Soviet experts in Changchun, Hungarian experts, and the Korean Consul General in Changchun also attended the meeting.

After the meeting began, Wu De, First Secretary of the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke first. He represented the 14 million people of Jilin Province in expressing full support for the solemn position of the Soviet government, and resolutely opposed the US aggression against the Soviet Union and the sabotaging of the Four-Power Summit. He said that the Soviet government's exposure of the US imperialists' aggressive crimes is entirely correct. US imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of world peace, and world peace can only be defended by resolutely fighting against it. His speech was constantly interrupted by storms of applause and earth-shattering slogans.

Next, Vasilyev, a representative of Soviet experts in Changchun, spoke. He said that the Soviet people and the people of the whole world have enough strength not only to cool down the aggressors' feverish heads, but also to finally eliminate imperialism.

Also speaking at the meeting were the head of the Jilin Provincial Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, representatives of local organizations of various democratic parties, representatives of various people's organizations, and representatives of workers and peasants.

    参加集会和示威的人们，对美帝国主义的侵略罪行感到极大的愤怒。鼓楼车辆厂老工人戎建堂在群众集会上愤慨万分地说：1946年，我亲眼看到美帝国主义一面玩弄调停阴谋，一面将大批军火运来中国支持国民党反动派打内战。现在，美帝国主义又一面谈和平，一面派飞机侵略苏联的领空，破坏四国首脑会议，我们决不能容忍美帝国主义的犯罪行为。
