    Automatic Clothing Cutter
    Labor Leiming, a Communist Party member from the Guangzhou Li Yuxing Knitting Factory, has successfully created an automatic clothing cutter. Using the automatic clothing cutter, all you have to do is flip the power switch, and entire pieces of fabric are conveyed from one end of the machine like flowing water. The machine cuts the fabric into pieces of various shapes according to size and folds them neatly.
    In addition to the motor and ball bearings for the transmission belt system, the other components of this machine are made from waste materials. It can cut four sizes of undershirts, cutting one thousand four hundred and forty dozen a day, which is equivalent to the output of twenty-two clothing workers.

    自动裁衣机
    广州市李裕兴针织厂共产党员劳乐明，创造成功了自动裁衣机。用自动裁衣机裁衣，只要把电开关一搬，整幅的布匹就像流水似的从机台的一端传送过来，机器按照尺码和各种形状把布裁成一片一片的，并且折叠得整整齐齐。
    这种机器除了传动带系统的马达和滚珠轴承外，其他机件都是利用废料制造的。它能够裁四种尺码的汗衫，一天裁一千四百四十打，相当于二十二个裁衣工人的数量。
