Comrades:
    On behalf of all members of the Beijing Urban People's Commune, I firmly support the Japanese people's struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty and firmly support the Japanese people's heroic struggle for independence and democracy.
    U.S. imperialism is a warmonger and the number one enemy of the people of the world, supporting reactionaries everywhere to oppress the people. It signed the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty with the Nobusuke Kishi reactionary clique, preparing for a war of aggression and ordering the Japanese people to serve as cannon fodder. We Chinese people have suffered from Japanese imperialist aggression, and we will never allow the U.S.-Japan reactionaries to provoke war again. We will firmly stand with the Japanese people, the Asian people, and the people of the world to fight to the end to completely shatter the war conspiracies of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries and to defend peace in Asia and the world.
    The Japanese people have already waged one heroic struggle after another to oppose the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, and from today onwards, they will launch an even larger-scale struggle. We believe that the just struggle of the Japanese people will surely achieve final victory. The will and power of the people are irresistible, and the fate of the lackeys of imperialism will be the same as that of Syngman Rhee, who was smashed to pieces by the people!
    All members of our Beijing Urban People's Commune are determined to do a good job in production and work, and use our practical actions to support the struggle of the Japanese people.
    The people of China and Japan unite, the people of the world unite, and overthrow U.S. imperialism!

    人民的意志和力量是抗拒不了的
    天桥人民公社社员代表王玉蓉的讲话同志们：
    我代表北京城市人民公社全体社员，坚决支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争，坚决支持日本人民争取独立、民主的英勇斗争。
    美帝国主义是个战争贩子，是全世界人民的头号敌人，到处支持反动派欺压人民。它和岸信介反动集团签订日美军事同盟条约，准备侵略战争，叫日本人民给它当炮灰。我们中国人民遭受过日本帝国主义的侵略，我们绝不允许美日反动派重新挑起战争。我们坚决同日本人民、亚洲人民和全世界人民站在一起，为彻底粉碎美日反动派的战争阴谋、为保卫亚洲和世界和平斗争到底。
    日本人民为了反对日美军事同盟条约，已经进行了一次又一次的英勇斗争，从今天起又要开展一个规模更大的斗争。我们相信，日本人民的正义斗争，一定能够取得最后的胜利。人民的意志和力量是抗拒不了的，帝国主义奴才的下场，就会和李承晚一样，被人民打得粉身碎骨！
    我们北京城市人民公社的全体社员，决心搞好生产，搞好工作，用我们的实际行动支援日本人民的斗争。
    中日两国人民团结起来，全世界人民团结起来，打倒美帝国主义！
