Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 12th -- Chongqing, a city that suffered cruel bombing by Japanese militarism during the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, saw over 800,000 people hold a massive rally and demonstration today to oppose the US-Japan reactionaries' conspiracy to plot a new war, and to resolutely support the Japanese people's just struggle against the US-Japan military alliance treaty.

　　The mountain city of Chongqing was ignited with flames of anger today. Starting at noon, the mighty demonstration crowds surged towards various venues. At Datianwan Square in the city center, more than 50,000 people held a rally of people from all walks of life in the city to support the Japanese people's struggle against the US-Japan military alliance treaty. Li Tangbin and Xin Yizhi, Secretaries of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, along with many responsible cadres from the Chongqing Party and government, and the responsible persons of various democratic parties and people's organizations, attended the meeting. Liao Suhua, Standing Committee Member of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman of the Chongqing Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, delivered a speech at the meeting. He said: The 4.4 million people of Chongqing resolutely stand on the side of the Japanese people and firmly support their just struggle against the US-Japan military alliance treaty. Liao Suhua solemnly pointed out: It is not the US-Japan reactionaries who decide the fate of Japan, but the Japanese people themselves. No matter how rampant the US-Japan reactionaries are today, they are destined to suffer a shameful defeat. US imperialism, which runs rampant on Japanese territory, will surely be driven out by the heroic and unyielding Japanese people who persist in their struggle. During Liao Suhua's speech, the more than 50,000 people in the venue repeatedly raised flags and shouted angrily: "Oppose the US-Japan military alliance treaty!" "US imperialism get out of Japan! Get out of our territory of Taiwan!"

　　At the meeting, Ding Changhe, Chairman of the Chongqing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and the responsible persons of various democratic parties and people's organizations in Chongqing, as well as representatives of workers, peasants, students, and urban people's communes, all spoke. They firmly stated that the people of Chongqing, together with the people of the whole country, will always stand on the side of the Japanese people and resolutely oppose the US-Japan reactionaries' conspiracy to plot a new war. Xu Cuijuan, Deputy Director of the Qixinggang People's Commune, who wandered to Chongqing from her hometown of Zhejiang during the War of Resistance Against Japan, and whose entire property was bombed away by Japanese invading aircraft after arriving in Chongqing, had to give away her young siblings to others. She said at the meeting: I will never forget the Japanese imperialists' aggression against China and the atrocities they committed in China. Today, the wolf-hearted and dog-lunged US imperialism and Japanese militarism have colluded again to sign the US-Japan military alliance treaty. We resolutely will not allow the US-Japan reactionaries to provoke war again, and we will stand firmly with the Japanese people to thoroughly smash the US-Japan reactionaries' war conspiracy.

　　The meeting also adopted a telegram from people from all walks of life in Chongqing to support the Japanese people's opposition to the US-Japan military alliance treaty.

　　All districts of Chongqing and all factories, schools, urban and rural people's communes held rallies and demonstrations today. 800,000 people participated in today's rallies and demonstrations. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Chongqing suffered years of indiscriminate bombing by Japanese militarism. Entire streets were bombed and destroyed, and tens of thousands of people died in the bombing by Japanese militarism. Today, many workers, peasants, and urban people's commune members who personally suffered from the disasters of the Japanese militarist war of aggression participated in the rallies and demonstrations. More than 2,000 residents of the Jiaochangkou area, which was bombed into rubble and suffered heavy casualties by Japanese militarist aircraft during the War of Resistance Against Japan, held a demonstration today. Lu Renfu, a sewing worker from Xinglong Street, accused everyone in the parade: "In 1939, Japanese fascists carried out seven days and seven nights of inhuman bombing in Chongqing. The Xinglong Street where I lived was bombed into rubble, and my elderly mother and sixteen-year-old sister were both killed. I hate the Japanese militarists to death!" She said that she would never allow the US-Japan reactionaries to engage in military alliance treaties and plot new wars to ravage people like her who are living peaceful and happy lives. Chen Sufang, a 57-year-old woman, a member of the Qixinggang People's Commune, whose right leg was broken by Japanese invading aircraft in 1939, said with extreme indignation: Today, the US-Japan reactionaries want to collude to carry out war conspiracies again. I will never tolerate these war merchants destroying peace and slaughtering people again. The employees of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, who suffered multiple indiscriminate bombings by Japanese fascists, held a radio rally today. The employees were filled with righteous indignation. Zhang Yuxiang, a senior worker and advanced producer from the large rolling mill, said angrily: "We suffered a lot from the bullying of Japanese militarism in the past, and many things are still very clear in our memory today. When our factory was forced to move from Hanyang to Chongqing, the Japanese militarist aircraft followed the ships and bombed them, and also strafed with machine guns. Two machines were destroyed, and many worker brothers were killed. After the factory moved to Chongqing, it was bombed by Japanese militarist aircraft many times. Now the US-Japan reactionaries are engaged in military alliance treaties, conspiring to plan a new war of aggression. We the working class will never allow them to be so presumptuous. We firmly support the just struggle of the Japanese people."

    决不容许美帝国主义放肆
    八十万重庆人民集会反对美日反动派策划新战争
    新华社重庆12日电　在八年抗日战争中曾经遭到日本军国主义残酷轰炸的重庆市，今天有八十多万人民举行了规模巨大的集会和示威游行，反对美日反动派策划新战争的阴谋，坚决支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的正义斗争。
    山城重庆今天燃起了愤怒的火焰。从中午开始，浩浩荡荡的示威群众就涌向各个会场。在城区大田湾广场，下午有五万多人在这里举行了全市各界人民支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约大会。中共重庆市委书记李唐彬、辛易之和重庆市党和政府的许多负责干部，各民主党派、人民团体的负责人都出席了大会。中共重庆市委常委、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会重庆分会主席廖苏华在大会上发表了演说，他说：重庆四百四十万人民，坚决站在日本人民一边，坚决支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的正义斗争。廖苏华严正指出：决定日本命运的决不是美日反动派，而是日本人民自己。不管美日反动派今天多么猖獗，它们总是注定要遭到可耻失败的。在日本领土上横行霸道的美帝国主义，一定要被英勇不屈、坚持斗争的日本人民赶出去。在廖苏华讲话过程中，会场里五万多群众多次高举旗帜，愤怒高呼：“反对日美军事同盟条约！”“美帝国主义从日本滚出去！从我国领土台湾滚出去！”
    在大会上，市总工会主席丁长河，重庆市各民主党派、人民团体的负责人和工人、农民、学生、城市人民公社的代表都讲了话。他们坚决表示：重庆人民要和全国人民一起，始终站在日本人民一边，坚决反对美日反动派策划的新战争阴谋。七星岗人民公社副社长徐翠娟在抗日战争时远从家乡浙江流浪到重庆，到重庆后又被日本侵略飞机炸光了全部财产，不得不把年幼的弟妹都送给了别人。她在大会上说：我永远不会忘记日本帝国主义对中国发动侵略战争，在中国无恶不作的暴行，今天狼心狗肺的美帝国主义和日本军国主义又勾结起来，签订日美军事同盟条约，我们坚决不允许美日反动派重新挑起战争，坚决同日本人民站在一起，一定要彻底粉碎日美反动派的战争阴谋。
    大会上还通过了重庆市各界人民支援日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的通电。
    重庆全市各区和各工厂、学校、城市和农村人民公社今天都举行了集会和示威游行，参加今天集会和示威的有八十万人。在抗日战争中，重庆市连年遭受日本军国主义的狂轰滥炸，街道整条整条地被炸毁，成千上万的人死于日本军国主义的轰炸中。今天有许多亲身遭受日本军国主义侵略战争灾害的工人、农民和城市人民公社社员都参加了集会和示威游行。曾经在抗日战争时期被日本军国主义飞机轰炸得片瓦不存、死伤惨重的较场口地区的二千多居民今天举行了示威，兴隆街缝纫工人卢仁福在游行队伍里向大家控诉说：“1939年日本法西斯在重庆连续进行了七天七夜的惨无人道的轰炸，我居住的兴隆街被炸成一片瓦砾，我年老的母亲和十六岁的妹妹都惨遭炸死，我恨死了日本军国主义分子！”她说，她决不容许美日反动派又搞军事同盟条约、策划新战争的阴谋，再来蹂躏像她一样过着和平幸福生活的人们。七星岗人民公社社员、1939年被日本侵略飞机炸断右腿的五十七岁的老大娘陈素芳异常愤慨地说：今天美日反动派又想勾结起来搞战争阴谋活动，我决不能容忍这些战争贩子们再来破坏和平和屠杀人民。曾经遭受日本法西斯多次滥炸的重庆钢铁公司的职工，今天举行了广播大会，职工们群情激愤，大型轧钢厂老工人、先进生产者张玉祥愤怒地说：“我们过去饱受了日本军国主义的欺侮，很多事情今天还记得很清楚，我们工厂被迫从汉阳搬到重庆来的时候，日本军国主义的飞机跟着轮船轰炸，还用机关枪扫射，有二部机器被炸毁，有许多工人弟兄被炸死。工厂搬到重庆以后，又遭到日本军国主义飞机多次轰炸。现在美日反动派又在搞军事同盟条约，阴谋策划新的侵略战争，我们工人阶级决不容许他们这样放肆，我们坚决支持日本人民的正义斗争。”
