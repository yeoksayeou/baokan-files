Xinhua News Agency Report:

    Under the impetus of the nationwide technical revolution movement, national workers' spare-time education has witnessed a sustained leap forward of great development, great popularization, and great improvement since the beginning of this year. By the end of March, the number of workers participating in spare-time studies had reached over 22.2 million, an increase of 35% compared to the 16.8 million at the end of last year. In all aspects, including the scope and scale of schooling, teaching forms, content, and methods, the principle of "combining with production and teaching according to aptitude" has been further implemented, presenting an unprecedentedly prosperous scene in workers' education.

    In carrying out workers' spare-time education, various regions have implemented the spirit of "grasping both ends and bringing along the middle," vigorously developing spare-time higher education and secondary specialized education. By the end of the first quarter, the number of workers studying in spare-time universities nationwide had reached over 370,000, doubling the number at the end of last year. The number of students in secondary specialized schools and high schools also increased by 40% and 50% respectively compared to the end of last year. In Jiangsu, one-quarter of the counties have established universities and university classes, with Jiangyin County alone establishing 22 university classes. At the same time, significant achievements have been made in workers' literacy campaigns. Due to the great determination and enthusiasm of leaders at all levels, the number of illiterate workers who have been made literate in the first three months of this year reached 2 million, equivalent to the total number of people made literate last year. The vast majority of provinces and cities have already eliminated more than 40% of their total number of illiterate people. In provinces and cities such as Heilongjiang, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Shanxi, Liaoning, and Fujian, as well as systems such as the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry, railways, and posts and telecommunications, the proportion of non-illiterate workers accounts for more than 95% of the total number of workers. In the coal industry, where the proportion of illiterate people was previously the highest, accounting for 40% of the total number of workers, it has now dropped to around 20%, and the focus of literacy efforts is being further shifted to small coal mines in southern provinces. The literacy movement is not only large in scale but also diverse in methods, fast in speed, and high in quality. Shanxi Province's advanced experience in phonetic literacy is being vigorously promoted in various regions. This literacy method is fast and effective and can fundamentally eliminate the phenomenon of relapse into illiteracy. The advanced experience of rapid literacy through homophone word association and queueing, which originated in Sichuan Province, has been spread to Heilongjiang, Jilin, Hebei, Qinghai, and other places. Some enterprises in Qingdao City, Shandong Province, have also concentrated the advantages of these two advanced experiences, using Hanyu Pinyin to teach homophone literacy textbooks, eliminating illiteracy entirely ahead of schedule. Shanghai, Lushun-Dalian, Shijiazhuang, and other places have also launched "leak-checking" work. As various regions have universally achieved a close connection between literacy and the popularization of spare-time elementary education, the number of students studying at the higher primary level increased by 57% by the end of the first quarter compared to the 7.38 million at the end of last year.

    Since the beginning of this year, national workers' education has been further combined with production, effectively promoting the current technical revolution movement. In order to meet the urgent needs of production and workers, some units have organized teachers to go to workshops to teach, teaching what workers need and working together to tackle key problems. Some have held various short-term training courses and accelerated secondary and higher vocational schools to systematically impart professional knowledge. Many factories in Shanghai are sweeping away "scientific illiteracy," helping workers master urgently needed knowledge of ultrasonics, radio, chemistry, electricity, optics, and other fields in the shortest possible time during innovation. The Guangzhou Bada Rivet Factory held an automated operator training class to promote advanced technology, enabling the factory's two automated production lines to quickly begin normal production. In this way, the enthusiasm of the vast number of workers for learning is growing, and the past practice of "production is busy, learning stops" has been broken. Instead, "the more intense the production, the more active the learning," with the technical revolution and the cultural revolution flying side by side.

    In the short months of this year, the brilliant achievements of workers' education have been mainly due to the further development of mass movements under the leadership of the Party. Many provinces and cities have conducted major inspections, major publicity campaigns, major evaluations, and major promotions of workers' education. Various provinces and industrial systems have also universally convened on-site meetings, organized advanced experience promotion teams, with representatives of advanced collectives or individuals sharing their experiences in person, timely and widely disseminating advanced experience, helping the advanced to become more advanced, and the backward to catch up with the advanced. The "passing on of scriptures" and "seeking of treasures" among enterprises are even more endless, forming a situation where people learn wherever there is advancement, and people help wherever there is backwardness. The "Iron Workers' School" movement in Fujian Province, the "Red Flag Spare-Time School" movement in Suzhou City, and the "Red Flag Spare-Time School" movement in Jing'an District, Shanghai, are all new forms developed on this basis. Competitions based on regions have also begun to appear. Xianyang and Tongchuan cities in Shaanxi Province launched five comparisons (comparison of enrollment, comparison of attendance, comparison of homework, comparison of guaranteed time, comparison of teacher training) and mutual assistance in January of this year, becoming advanced cities in the province's workers' education.

    大办业余高等教育　大抓扫除文盲工作
    全国职工业余教育发展快成绩大
    头三个月扫除职工文盲达二百万人，参加业余学习的职工超过两千万
    据新华社讯　全国职工业余教育在全民性的技术革命运动的带动下，今年以来出现了大发展大普及大提高的持续跃进的局面。截至3月底，参加业余学习的职工已达到二千二百多万人，比去年年底的一千六百八十多万人增长了35％。在办学范围、规模，教学形式、内容和方法等各个方面，进一步贯彻了“结合生产，因材施教”的原则，使职工教育呈现一片空前繁荣的景象。
    各地开展职工业余教育中，贯彻了“抓两头带中间”的精神，大办业余高等教育和中等专业教育。到第一季度末，全国职工业余大学生已达到三十七万多人，比去年年底翻了一番，中等专业学校和高中的学员，也分别比去年年底增长四成和五成。江苏已有四分之一的县办起了大学和大学班，江阴县就办起大学班二十二个。同时，职工扫盲工作也获得了很大成绩。由于各级领导决心大，干劲足，今年头三个月全国扫除的职工文盲达二百万人，相当于去年全年扫除文盲的总和。绝大多数省市都已经扫除了文盲总数的40％以上。黑龙江、江苏、上海、山西、辽宁、福建等省市和第一机械工业、铁路、邮电等系统非文盲职工的比重，都占职工总数的95％以上。煤炭系统过去文盲比重最大，占职工总数的40％，现在已下降到20％左右，并且进一步把扫盲重点转向南方各省的小煤矿。扫盲运动不仅声势大，而且办法多，速度快，质量高。山西省拼音扫盲的先进经验，正在各地大力推广，这种扫盲方法又快又好，可以从根本上消灭回生复盲现象。同音字联词排队快速扫盲先进经验，从四川省传到黑龙江、吉林、河北、青海等地。山东青岛市有的企业又集中了这两种先进经验的优点，利用汉语拼音教同音扫盲课本，提前将文盲全部扫除。上海、旅大、石家庄等地还开展了“查漏”工作。由于各地普遍做到扫盲与普及业余初等教育紧紧衔接，高小在学学员到第一季度末就比去年年底的七百三十八万人增长五成七。
    今年以来，全国职工教育进一步结合生产，有力地促进了当前的技术革命运动。为了适应生产和工人的急切需要，有的单位组织教师下车间教学，工人需要什么教什么，一起动手攻关键；有的举办各种短期训练班以及速成中专、高专，比较系统地传授专业知识。上海许多工厂大扫“科学盲”，帮助工人在最短时间内掌握革新中急需的超声波、无线电、化学、电学、光学等知识。广州八达铆钉厂举办了自动化操纵手训练班，推广先进技术，使全厂两条自动生产线很快地进行正常生产。这样，广大职工学习劲头越来越大，过去那种“生产忙，学习停”的惯例已经打破，而是“生产越紧张，学习越积极”，技术革命与文化革命比翼高飞。
    在今年短短的几个月里，职工教育所以取得辉煌的成就，主要是在党的领导下，进一步开展了群众运动。许多省市，都进行了职工教育大检查、大宣传、大评比、大促进。各个省和产业系统还普遍召开了现场会议，组织了先进经验推广队，由先进集体代表或个人现身说法，及时广泛地传播先进经验，帮助先进的更先进，落后的赶上先进。企业之间的“传经”、“取宝”更是络绎不绝，形成那里先进就有人学，那里落后就有人帮。福建省的“铁工校”运动，苏州市的“红旗业余学校”运动，上海市静安区的“红旗业余学校”运动，都是在这个基础上发展起来的新形式。以地区为单位的竞赛也已经开始出现，陕西省咸阳和铜川两个市今年1月开展了职工教育五比（比入学、比出席、比作业、比保证时间、比教师培训）和互相协助等，成为这个省职工教育的先进城市。
