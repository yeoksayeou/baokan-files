    Latecomers Must Surpass Those Ahead
    By Our Correspondent He Changhua

    Since March 26, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has convened an industrial conference. This is a conference to vigorously oppose right-leaning tendencies, boost morale, and strive for the top, pushing the mass movement of "compare, learn, catch up, and help" on the city's industrial front to a new climax.

    For more than a month, a very gratifying scene has emerged: factories that were originally in a backward state, unwilling to lag behind, have vigorously caught up with the advanced, and have entered the ranks of the advanced, achieving "later surpassing." The units in the lead, seeing that others are learning fast and catching up fiercely, feel both that the situation is very good and that the pressure is very great, and dare not relax in the slightest. Those in the "middle reaches," who were originally unstable, feel even more that they cannot "muddle along" and have also caught up. As a result, more and more advanced units, advanced collectives, and advanced individuals have emerged.

    Advanced, intermediate, and backward units change positions several times a day, and the competition is very fierce. Such a race to catch up with each other is pushing our technological transformation and production and construction to a higher stage, and rapidly advancing our era!

    This is another distinct characteristic of the current excellent situation of the city's technical revolution movement.

    In this revolutionary competition of mutual striving for the top, many moving stories have been told:

    In the first early spring of the 1960s, a thunderclap resounded in a small steel rolling mill in Zhabei—the Lianhua Strip Steel Mill. They spent only seven days to get rid of heavy manual labor and achieve mechanization. This event shook Shanghai, and the slogan "Learn from Lianhua, catch up with Lianhua, surpass Lianhua" appeared everywhere. This event alarmed filmmakers, and they will co-produce a color feature film focusing on the heroic deeds of Lianhua's seven-day revolution: "The First Spring of the 1960s."

    Full of revolutionary passion, the filmmakers spent seven days collecting material and writing a story outline at the speed of Lianhua; seven days to write a literary script. The film was about to start shooting, but a problem was encountered: it was impossible to find shots of the backward state before the revolution in Lianhua.

    So, they found the nearby Shanghai Calendering Plant. The Calendering Plant was indeed similar to Lianhua before the revolution. It also rolled strip steel, and the technological revolution had not yet broken out. The workers were still using pliers to manipulate the fiery red steel bars in a smoggy environment. But no one expected that filming would cause a "disturbance," and a new comedy appeared in real life. This comedy profoundly depicts the new features of the era.

    The news of "filming" spread quickly among the masses of the Calendering Plant. Being on the screen is not always a pleasant thing, it depends on what role you play. The masses of the Calendering Plant were not happy to play this role, and they were full of resentment.

    "Don't let them film!"
    "We won't be a stand-in for the old Lianhua!"
    "If it is made into a movie and shown nationwide, everyone will know that our Calendering Plant is dragging down socialist construction, that would be terrible!"
    "Yes, find a way to change the face, then they won't be able to film it even if they come!"

    In those few days, the advance personnel of the film studio came to the Calendering Plant continuously. In their view, everything was as usual. But the storm did come, although a little late, the wind was very strong.

    The branch secretary, who came from an old worker background, drew his plan, which he had been conceiving for two or three years, on a piece of draft paper and discussed it with everyone. Materials were a big problem, and everyone from the factory director to the workers ran around to get them. Many gear disks were needed on the steel turning machine. Since they couldn't get them, they cut the steel plate into circles and filed them with files day and night, and they managed to file out one tooth after another on the steel plate. Before the small railway was finished, there were no steel rails, so they welded two flat steels together to replace them. Only one person knew how to do electric welding, and there was no time for that. Within three or four days, more than twenty people learned it, and they snatched the electric welding gun from each other. Originally, only four people could get on the lathe, but suddenly more than a dozen people could do it...

    After four days and four nights of fighting, many people's throats were hoarse and their eyes were red. But they were victorious: they achieved semi-automation. They said happily and proudly: Now, filming can begin.

    The story of the Calendering Plant is over, but the comedy is not over yet. In those days when the Calendering Plant turned over, the comrades from the film studio visited another small strip steel mill that was still in a backward state—the Xiangfeng Steel Rolling Mill—which aroused speculation among the workers there. At that time, the workers there did not know about the "disturbance" at the Calendering Plant.

    The branch secretary of Xiangfeng thought to himself: They must be making a movie about an advanced factory, and they came to us to find the background of backward operations. Originally, he felt that compared to Lianhua, of course, it was not as good, but compared to Xiangfeng Calendering Plant, it was better. At this time, he hurriedly ranked the backward factories in the same industry, and felt that they would not find us. Thinking this way, he felt more "comfortable" in his heart. Then, the industrial conference was held, and the city's situation developed very quickly, and he began to realize that he was behind the situation. Immediately afterward, news came that the Calendering Plant had turned over in four days, which shocked him even more. He criticized his right-leaning conservative thinking to the masses and vowed to catch up.

    Seeing that the leaders were determined, the masses were very excited and moved their bedding to the factory. Everyone was very enthusiastic and decided: to change the face in four days, not to be a stand-in for the Calendering Plant, and not to let the backward face appear on the screen. Sure enough, they realized their wish on April 2 as scheduled and achieved semi-automation. Another "later comes first."

    The rapid revolution of Xiangfeng Plant shocked another Hudong Tool Plant, which also produces strip steel. This factory had been rated as a middle-level factory for three consecutive times in the industry evaluation, especially in the third evaluation, it was almost rated as a backward factory. However, the idea of "more than enough compared to the bottom" made the leaders of Hudong Plant always feel that they were better than Xiangfeng Plant, which was rated as a backward factory. When the news that Xiangfeng Plant proposed to make a revolution in four days came, they saw that there was "no more than enough compared to the bottom," and deeply felt that "the middle reaches are not habitable." As for the workers, they had long been impatient. As soon as the leadership lit the fire, the fire of the technological revolution immediately burned fiercely. As a result, the revolution was made in two days, and semi-automation of strip steel production was realized.

    Lianhua (seven days)—Calendering (four days)—Xiangfeng (four days)—Hudong (two days), this is just an epitome of the city's competition to catch up with each other. There are many similar situations of "unwilling to lag behind and want to be in the top ranks" in real life. Huguang Scientific Instrument Factory is a bright red flag for the city's mass tackling of cutting-edge products. Wang Linhe in the factory is a famous innovation pioneer in trial-producing high-voltage bridges. In the same industry, there is a Shanghai River Instrument Factory, which has made slower progress in comparison. "Huguang" and "Hujiang" are similar in pronunciation in Shanghai dialect. This difference in one word has caused many jokes: some people mistakenly took Hujiang's products as Huguang's high-voltage bridges and cheered loudly. Young Pioneers made the wrong phone call and asked Hujiang for Uncle Wang Linhe. When Hujiang's sales staff went out, people also said: You are the red flag factory, we must vigorously assist you. These things made the staff of Hujiang feel like a thousand pounds of stones were pressing on their hearts, which was very uncomfortable. However, this uncomfortable feeling has also turned into a huge driving force to change the face. They said: People mistakenly think we are Huguang, we must truly become Huguang! So they chased and caught up, and successfully trial-produced 65 new products within five days. One day Huguang made more than 20 kinds, and they made 30 kinds the next night. The factory director participated in the industrial conference outside, and called back every half an hour to understand the situation. How urgently they were catching up!

    The "disturbance" caused by filming, and the change promoted by the difference of one word, seem to be accidental coincidences. In fact, this is not the case. There is inevitability in this, that is, no one wants to be content with backwardness, and everyone wants to strive for the top. These situations also illustrate a problem: things are developing and changing. Temporary backwardness is not terrible. As long as you work hard, you can transform into advanced in seven days, four days, or even two days. "Scholars should be viewed with new eyes after three days." It also tells advanced units: they must speed up their horses and not dismount, and go to the next level, otherwise others will catch up with you, and you will become relatively backward.

    Backwardness can be transformed into advancement, but it does not mean that those who are backward can naturally become advanced without effort. To turn possibility into reality, you must also go through subjective efforts. This subjective initiative is energy. The key to later coming first lies in whether there is great energy.

    A large number of things in real life have repeatedly proved this point. Shanghai Instrument Factory is a newly built modern factory. The five-story building has excellent equipment, strong technical force, and more than 1,000 people. However, because of insufficient energy of individual leaders, these favorable conditions could not be used well, and only 12 new products were made in three days. In the industry evaluation, it got the second to last place. Huguang Scientific Instrument Factory is a small factory in an alley, with only more than 100 people, and the conditions are certainly not as good as Shanghai Instrument Factory. However, due to the sufficient energy of the leaders and the full reliance on the masses to create conditions, more than 20 kinds of new products were made in one day. In the industry evaluation, it got the first place. This comparison brought out the energy of Shanghai Instrument Factory, mobilized the masses to catch up with Huguang, and made more than 200 kinds of new products in one day, many of which were high-level cutting-edge products. In addition, there is another small factory in the alley, Defeng Electric Meter Factory, with only more than 50 production workers, and most of them are new workers, without technicians. Originally, there were only two dilapidated lathes. However, they have high aspirations and great energy, and actively create various conditions. For example, if there is a lack of technical data and they do not know foreign languages, some employees find those intermittent Chinese sentences sandwiched between the words in Japanese books, and ponder, guess, and judge their meaning; they also find formulas in Russian books and circuit diagrams in English books, and finally overcome the difficulties. In a short period of time, this factory has continuously produced more than 100 kinds of new products, including cutting-edge products with international standards. It is really a phoenix flying out of a chicken coop. It can be seen from the above how much difference the size of people's energy can produce.

    The size of the energy depends on people's understanding, awareness, ambition, and style. For latecomers to surpass those ahead, the first step is to recognize their own backwardness and admit that they are backward. If you are in a backward state but not aware of it, but complacent about certain achievements; or if you see it and are content with backwardness, with little ambition, it is impossible to catch up with the advanced. The fact that the national small open-hearth furnace high-yield red flag has changed hands between the Shanghai Steel No. 3 Plant and the Shanghai Steel No. 1 Plant fully illustrates this point. For the past two years, the red flag has been planted on the open-hearth furnace of the No. 3 Plant. Originally, the conditions of the No. 1 Plant's open-hearth furnace were not worse than those of the No. 3 Plant, but they had been complaining that their objective conditions were not good, and thought: "Bare feet can't catch up with the No. 3 Plant's open-hearth furnace." After overturning the right-leaning fear of difficulties and establishing lofty ambitions, they won the national red flag from the No. 3 Plant in February and March. Since the No. 3 Plant's open-hearth furnace was planted with the red flag, a current of pride and complacency secretly grew in the hearts of some leading cadres and workers. Originally, they went out to learn from others' experience, but when they came back, they said "there is nothing" and even picked on others' faults. Pride and complacency made them relax their ideological work and fail to grasp the production plan tightly, and they lost their set of work experience. As a result, the red flag was also lost.

    Of course, losing the red flag cannot be said to be a good thing, but it can also be said to be a good thing. This was a big thunderbolt in a clear sky for the workers of the No. 3 Plant, and they suddenly woke up. From leading cadres to the masses of workers, many people shed tears of grief and were unable to speak. It was not that they were unhappy that the brother factory took the red flag; but they felt that they had failed the party's expectations, were sorry for the party, and felt ashamed and heartbroken. The general branch of the workshop party held eight virtual discussions in a row, compared the advantages of the No. 1 Plant's open-hearth furnace, ranked their own eight backward aspects, and found eight reasons for the backwardness. The leaders and the masses admitted from the bottom of their hearts that they were backward.

    The painful tears turned into a huge driving force. The workers sent more than 600 letters of determination to the party organization, and some workers even drew "heart" graphics on the letters of determination. Some party member workers used the determination of "swearing to the party for the second time" (the first oath was to join the party) to express their determination to win back the red flag. Groups of people went to the No. 1 Plant's open-hearth furnace to work and learn at the same time, and humbly learned a lot of advanced experience. Recently, the furnace was repaired, and they took this opportunity to make major reforms to the furnace, and the furnace output can be increased by about one time. Their slogan is: "Losing the red flag is not discouraged, determined to win back the red flag, united from top to bottom, not satisfied until the red flag returns!"

    The situation of the No. 1 and No. 3 plants competing for the national red flag is just as a poem warns: "There are green mountains beyond the mountains, and buildings beyond the buildings. Heroes and heroes compete for the top. Don't be proud of winning the top. There are still heroes ahead."

    We live in a socialist society, and any partner who is unwilling to lag behind will never feel isolated or helpless. They can get all possible help from all aspects. From the director of the Industrial Bureau, the secretary of the District Committee to the secretary of the Industry Party Committee, they went to the factory to focus on helping the backward to catch up with the advanced. When the workers of Shanghai Steel No. 3 Plant went to Shanghai Steel No. 1 Plant to learn advanced experience, the workers of the No. 1 Plant, who won the red flag of the open-hearth furnace, lined up at the entrance of the factory and welcomed them all the way to the workshop with firecrackers and applause, and warmly said to the brothers of the No. 3 Plant: "We hope you catch up and surpass us and jointly complete the national steelmaking plan!" Jiangnan Shipyard, Shanghai Steel No. 1, 2, 5 Plants and other units sent more than 1,000 people to support the No. 3 Plant in repairing the furnace. When these class brothers heard that the workers of the No. 3 Plant had lost the red flag and shed tears, they all said: We must help repair the furnace and win back the red flag. Many people automatically worked more than 12 hours a day. In the days when the Shanghai Calendering Plant was unwilling to appear on the screen with a backward face and made a revolution, not only many factories extended their warm hands to them, but even the comrades of the People's Bank of China helped them find a batch of materials with special specifications. Hearing that the Xiangfeng Steel Rolling Mill was going to make a revolution in four days, the neighborhood canteen mobilized many residents to make dumplings, zongzi, rice cakes..., and sent them to them with gongs and drums.

    "Latecomers must surpass those ahead!" In our era, how widely, enthusiastically, and warmly it is expected, concerned, supported, and congratulated by people!

    后来者定要居上
    本报记者　贺昌华
    从3月26日开始，中共上海市委召开了工业会议。这是一个大张旗鼓地反右倾，鼓干劲，争上游的会议，它把全市工业战线上的“比、学、赶、帮”群众运动推上了一个新的高潮。
    一个多月来，出现了一个十分可喜的景象：原来处于落后状态的工厂，不甘落后，猛赶先进，纷纷跃入先进行列，来了个“后来居上”。走在前头的单位，眼看人家学得快，追得猛，既感形势很好，又感压力很大，丝毫不敢松懈。居于“中游”状态的，本来就不稳定，这时越发感到“混”不下去，也纷纷赶了上来。于是，越来越多的先进单位、先进集体和先进人物涌现出来了。
    先进、中间和落后一日数易其位，争夺十分激烈。如此你追我赶，我赶你追，把我们的技术改造工作和生产建设事业推向了更高的阶段，把我们的时代飞速推向前进！
    这正是当前全市技术革命运动大好形势又一个鲜明的特色。
    在这场互争上游、百舸争流的革命竞赛中，传出了许许多多动人的故事：
    在六十年代第一个初春，闸北一家小型轧钢厂——联华带钢厂响起一声春雷。他们仅仅用七天的时间，就摆脱了繁重的体力劳动，实现了机械化。这件事震动了全上海，“学联华、赶联华、超联华”的口号到处出现。这件事惊动了电影工作者，他们以联华英雄七天革个命的事迹为中心，将合拍一部彩色故事片：“六十年代第一春”。
    电影工作者满怀革命激情，以联华的速度七天搜集素材，写好故事梗概；七天写好文学剧本。电影就要开拍了，但是碰到一个问题：在联华已经找不到革命前的落后状态的镜头。
    于是，他们找到了附近的上海压延厂。压延厂的确和革命前的联华相似，轧的也是带钢，技术革命还未大闹起来，工人们还是在烟雾迷漫中，用钳子拨弄着火红的钢条。可是谁也没有想到，拍电影引起了一场“风波”，现实生活中出现了新的喜剧。这幕喜剧正深刻地刻画了时代的新风貌。
    “拍电影”的消息，在压延厂的群众中飞快地传开了。上银幕并不尽是使人愉快的事，要看扮演什么角色。压延厂的群众并不乐于扮演这个角色，他们憋着一肚子气。
    “不能让他们拍！”
    “我们不作老联华的替身！”
    “拍成电影，全国放映，到处都知道我们压延厂在拖社会主义建设的后腿，那还得了！”
    “对，想办法改变面貌，那时叫他们来拍也拍不成！”
    那几天，电影厂的先遣人员曾连续来到压延厂。在他们看来，一切如常。但是，风暴确实来了，虽然迟了一些，风势却很猛。
    老工人出身的支部书记，把他构思了两、三年的方案，画在一张草纸上，和大家讨论。材料是个大问题，从厂长到工人四出奔走，分头去搞。翻钢机上需要不少牙齿盘，搞不到，他们就把钢板截成圆形，手执锉刀连日连夜地锉，硬是在钢板上锉出一颗颗的牙齿来。小铁路还未铺完，钢轨没有了，就把两根扁钢焊在一起来代替。只有一个人会烧电焊，那里来得及，三、四天之内就有二十几人学会了，电焊枪你抢我夺。本来只有四人能上车床，一下子就有十几人能干一手……
    四天四夜奋战下来，很多人嗓子沙哑了，眼睛发红了。但是，他们胜利了：实现了半自动化。他们愉快而自豪地说：现在，电影可以开拍了。
    压延厂的故事结束了，但喜剧还没有结束。就在压延厂翻身的那些日子，电影制片厂的同志到另一个还处于落后状态的小带钢厂——祥丰轧钢厂参观，又引起那里的工人猜测纷纭。当时，那里的工人还不知道压延厂的一场“风波”。
    祥丰厂支部书记暗自思忖：一定是要拍先进厂的电影，到我们这里来找落后操作的背景的。本来他就觉得比上，当然不及联华，但比下，比压延厂总还好一些，这时，他又急急忙忙把同业中的落后厂排了个队，感到不会找我们。这样一想，心里才比较“舒坦”。接着，工业会议召开了，全市形势发展很快，他开始意识到自己落在形势的后面了。紧接着，又传来了压延厂四天大翻身的消息，使他更是大为震惊，他向群众检讨了自己的右倾保守思想，发奋要赶上去。
    群众见到领导有决心，十分兴奋，纷纷把铺盖搬到厂里来。大家热情很高，决定：也要四天改变面貌，不做压延厂的替身，不让落后面貌上银幕。果然，他们在4月2日如期实现了愿望，实现了半自动化。又是一个“后来居上”。
    祥丰厂疾风骤雨般的革命，又震惊了另一个也生产带钢的沪东工具厂。这个厂在行业评比中，曾连续三次被评为中间厂，特别是第三次评比，差一点被评为落后厂。但“比下有余”的思想，使沪东厂领导总觉得自己比起被评为落后厂的祥丰厂还高明一着。当祥丰厂提出四天革个命的消息一传来，他们看到“比下已无余”了，深感“中游不可居”。至于工人群众，早已耐不住性子。领导一点火，技术革命的大火立刻熊熊燃烧起来。结果两天就革了命，实现了带钢生产半自动化。
    联华（七天）—压延（四天）—祥丰（四天）—沪东（两天），这只是全市你追我赶竞赛中的一个缩影。类似这样“不甘落后，要居上游”的情况，在现实生活中还有很多。沪光科学仪器厂是全市群众性攻尖端产品的一面鲜艳的红旗，厂内的王林鹤是试制高压电桥著名的革新闯将。而同行业中，有一个沪江仪器厂，相形之下进步慢些。“沪光”和“沪江”，上海话字音相近。这一字之差，曾闹出了许多笑话：有人错把沪江的产品，当成沪光的高压电桥而高声喝采。少先队员把电话打错，向沪江找王林鹤叔叔。沪江的供销人员出去，人家也说：你们是红旗厂，我们一定大力协助。这些事弄得沪江的职工心里像压了千斤石，很不是个滋味。但是，这个难受的滋味也变成了决心改变面貌的巨大动力。他们说：人家错把我们当沪光，我们就要真正成为沪光！于是他们紧追猛赶，在五天之内就试制成功了六十五种新产品。有一天夜里沪光制成二十几种，他们就在第二天夜里制成三十种。厂长在外面参加工业会议，每隔半小时就打一次电话回来了解情况。赶得真紧呵！
    拍电影引起的“风波”，一字之差促成的变化，看来是些偶然的巧合。实则不然，这中间有必然性，那就是谁也不愿自甘落后，谁也要争得上游。这些情况，还说明了一个问题：事物是在发展的，变化的。暂时落后并不可怕，只要发奋图强，七天、四天、甚至两天，就可以转化为先进。“士隔三日”，就得“刮目相看”。也告诫先进的单位：必须快马加鞭不下鞍，再上一层楼，否则人家赶过了你，你就相对地变成落后。
    落后能够转化为先进，但决不是说，落后者可以不经过努力，就能自然地成为先进。把可能变为现实，还必须经过主观的努力。这个主观能动性，就是干劲。后来居上的关键，就在于是否有一个很大的干劲。
    现实生活中的大量事物，反复证明了这一点。上海仪表厂是个新建的现代化工厂，五层楼的大厦，设备很好，技术力量强，有一千多人。但原来由于个别领导人干劲不足，就不能很好运用这些有利条件，三天只制成十二种新产品，行业评比中得倒数第二名。沪光科学仪器厂是个弄堂小厂，只有一百多人，条件当然不如上海仪表厂。但由于领导干劲足，充分依靠群众去创造条件，一天就制成二十几种新产品，行业评比中得第一名。这一比，比出了上海仪表厂的干劲，发动群众猛赶沪光，一天就制成二百多种新产品，其中很多是高级尖端产品。另外还有一个弄堂小厂，德丰电表厂，只有五十多个生产工人，而且大部分是新工人，没有技术人员，本来只有两台破烂不堪的车床。但是，他们志气高，干劲大，积极创造各种条件。如技术资料缺乏，又不会外文，有的职工从日文书上找那些夹在字里行间的断断续续的中国字句，琢磨、猜测、判断它的意思；又从俄文书上找公式，英文书上找线路图，终于克服了困难。在短期内，这个厂连续制成了一百多种新产品，其中有具有国际水平的尖端产品。真是鸡窝里飞出了凤凰。由上可见，人的干劲大小可以产生多大的差异。
    干劲的大小，决定于人们的认识、觉悟、志气和作风。后来者居上，首要一着是要认识到自己的落后，承认自己落后。处于落后状态而不自觉，反而为某些成绩而沾沾自喜；或者看到了，自甘落后，志气不大，都不可能赶上先进。全国小型平炉高产红旗，在上钢三厂和上钢一厂之间易手，充分说明了这一点。两年来，红旗一直插在三厂的平炉上。本来一厂平炉条件并不比三厂差，但他们一直埋怨自己客观条件不好，认为：“赤脚也赶不上三厂平炉”。反掉了右倾畏难情绪，立下了雄心大志，2、3月份就从三厂手里夺得了全国红旗。三厂平炉从插上红旗以后，一股骄傲、自满的潜流，暗地里在某些领导干部和职工的心底里滋长。本来是出去学习人家经验的，但回来却说“没有啥”，甚至还挑人家的毛病。骄傲自满使他们把思想工作放松了，生产计划抓不紧了，自己积累的一套工作经验丢了。结果，红旗也丢了。
    丢了红旗当然不能说是好事，但也可以说是好事。这对三厂职工真是晴天打了个大霹雳，猛然惊醒。从领导干部到工人群众，很多人沉痛地流下了眼泪，泣不成声。倒不是兄弟厂拿去红旗不高兴；而是觉得自己辜负了党的期望，对不起党，深感惭愧和痛心。车间党总支接连八次务虚，对比一厂平炉的优点，排了自己八个落后方面，找出八个造成落后的原因。领导和群众从内心承认自己是落后了。
    难受的眼泪，化成了巨大的动力。工人们纷纷向党组织送来了六百多份决心书，有些决心书上面工人自己还画上“心”的图形。有的党员工人以“向党第二次宣誓”的决心（第一次宣誓是入党），来表示要夺回红旗的决心。成批的人马开到一厂平炉去边劳动，边学习，虚心学回了很多先进经验。最近，炉子进行修理，他们趁此机会把炉子作了重大的改革，炉产量可以提高一倍左右。他们的口号是：“丢了红旗不灰心，夺回红旗有决心，上下团结一条心，红旗不回不甘心！”
    一、三厂争夺全国红旗的情况，恰如一首诗歌所告诫的：“山外青山楼外楼，英雄好汉争上游，争得上游莫骄傲，还有英雄在前头。”
    我们生活在社会主义社会，任何不甘落后的伙伴，永远不会感到孤立、无援，他们可以从各方面得到一切可能的帮助。从工业局局长、区委书记到行业党委书记，纷纷下厂重点帮助落后的赶上先进。上钢三厂职工到上钢一厂去学习先进经验，夺得平炉红旗的一厂职工在厂门口排好队，用鞭炮和掌声把他们一直欢迎到车间里，并且热情地对三厂弟兄说：“我们希望你们赶上来，超过我们，共同来完成国家的炼钢计划！”江南造船厂、上钢一、二、五厂等等单位，派了一千多人来支援三厂修炉。这些阶级弟兄们听说三厂工人丢了红旗、流了泪，都纷纷表示：一定帮助修好炉子，夺回红旗。许多人每天自动地工作十二小时以上。在上海压延厂不甘以落后面貌上银幕而闹革命的日子里，不仅许多厂向他们伸出了热情的手，连人民银行的同志也帮助他们找到了一批特殊规格的材料。听说祥丰轧钢厂要四天革个命，里弄食堂动员了很多居民做糰子、粽子、米糕……，敲锣打鼓地送给他们。
    “后来者一定要居上！”在我们的时代里，它受到人们多么广泛、热情的期待、关切、支持和祝贺呵！
