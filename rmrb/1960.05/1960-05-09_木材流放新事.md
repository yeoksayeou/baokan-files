New Developments in Timber Rafting

    Sail-Powered Rafting
    Workers at the Water Transport Team of the Lian County Forestry Bureau in Guangdong Province have successfully experimented with sail-powered rafting, based on the principle of wind power for sailing ships.
    Using sail-powered rafting can reduce the labor intensity of workers and shorten the timber transport time.
    According to the team's experiments, sail-powered rafting can shorten the transport time by half compared to the past.
    Machine-Made Rafts on the Dadu River
    When timber is transported in large rivers, it must first be bundled into rafts. For many years, the raft-bundling work has relied on heavy manual labor. Recently, employees of the Leshan Timber Storage and Transportation Branch in Sichuan have successfully created a raft-bundling machine. Using this raft-bundling machine can increase efficiency three times compared to manual operation. According to first-quarter statistics, the timber turnover in the Leshan area increased by 120.72% compared to the same period last year, and the turnover in the Yibin area increased by 113.51%.
    Now, many places are promoting the experience of mechanical raft-bundling.
    Rafts That Don't Require People to Release Them
    Have you ever seen rafts that don't require people to release them?
    Recently, a successful experiment was conducted in the Qiyang Forest Area of Hunan. The workers in this area installed homemade automatic guidance devices on the rafts, so that rafting could be done without any manual poling. As long as simple guidance facilities are set up along the stream, the rafts can flow by themselves. The efficiency is two to three times higher than manual rafting.
    The Qiyang Forest Area has more than 20 streams of various sizes, and more than 90% of the timber felled in the county must be transported to small rivers through these small streams. Because transportation is restricted by the season, in the past, during the dry season, only two shipments could be made per day using the method of damming water. With the automatic guidance device, it is possible to carry out day and night transportation, which can be increased to at least four times a day during the same dry season. If 50% of the timber produced in the county this year is transported by streams using automatic raft guidance devices, more than 30,000 workdays can be saved. Using automatic guidance devices for rafting can also avoid the work-related injuries that often occur during manual rafting. This type of homemade guide is a wooden pointed device that uses hydraulic power to control the direction when rafting.
    Foot-Operated Raft Release Machine Saves People and Effort
    In the past, when transporting bamboo and wooden rafts on the water, people always held the pole and moved forward with each push. This manual operation was both laborious and inefficient. In the movement of vigorously carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution, the method of raft release is also being innovated. The employees of the Wucheng Logging Area in Xiuning County, Anhui Province, have successfully created a foot-operated raft release machine. After the timber is collected and transported to the big river, it can be compiled into rafts and transported by the foot-operated raft release machine, which greatly reduces the labor intensity of the workers.
    Large Rafts Nesting Small Rafts
    The Longxi Banmian Forestry Station in Fujian Province has made great improvements in the method of raft bundling during water transport innovation. They created a method of nesting small rafts within large rafts and appropriately lengthening and widening rafts on relatively wide rivers, so that the raft surface increased from an average of 14 square meters to 24 square meters, increasing efficiency by more than 65%. This station can save about 80,000 labor days a year. (Attached picture)

    木材流放新事
    风帆放排
    广东省连县林业局水运中队职工，根据帆船利用风力行驶的原理，试验风帆放排获得成功。
    利用风帆放排可以减轻工人的劳动强度，缩短木材流送时间。
    据这个队的试验，风帆放排比过去的流送时间可缩短一半。
    大渡河上机器扎筏
    木材在大河中流送，要先扎成筏（木排），扎筏工作多少年来都是依靠笨重的手工操作。四川乐山木材储运分局的职工，最近创造成功了扎筏机。利用这种扎筏机扎筏，比手工操作提高工效三倍。据第一季度的统计，乐山地区的木材转运量比去年同期提高120.72％，宜宾地区的转运量提高113.51％。
    现在，很多地方都推广了机械扎筏的经验。
    不用人放的木排
    你看到过不用人放的木排么？
    最近在湖南祁阳林区试验成功了。这个区的职工把木排装上土制自动导向器，放排就完全可以不用人工撑篙，只要在沿溪设置简便的诱导设施，木排就可以自行流送。流送效率比人放排提高二倍到三倍。
    祁阳林区有大小溪流二十多条，全县砍伐的木材有90％以上要通过这些小溪流送到小河里。由于流送受到季节的限制，过去在枯水期，利用扎坝蓄水的办法，每天只能流送二次。有了自动导向器以后，就可实行昼夜流送，在同样的枯水期每天至少可以增加到四次。今年全县生产的木材，如果溪运50％使用木排自动导向器，就可节省三万多个劳动日。利用自动导向器放排，又可避免人工放排经常发生的工伤事故。这种土导向器是一种木制尖形设备，放排时利用水力来控制方向。
    脚踏放筏机省人又省力
    在水上放运竹排木筏，从来都是人扶着篙，撑一下前进一步。这种人工操作既费力，效率又不高。在大搞技术革新和技术革命运动中，放筏的方法也在革新。安徽休宁县吴城伐区的职工，创制成功了脚踏放筏机。木材集运到大河里以后，编成木筏就可利用脚踏放筏机放运出去，大大减轻了工人的劳动强度。
    大排套小排
    福建龙溪坂面林业站，在水运革新中，在扎木排的方法上有很大改进，他们创造一种以大排套小排和在比较宽的河上适当加长加宽木排的办法，使排面由过去平均十四平方米增加到二十四平方米，提高工效65％以上，这个站一年就可以节约劳动力八万个左右。（附图片）
