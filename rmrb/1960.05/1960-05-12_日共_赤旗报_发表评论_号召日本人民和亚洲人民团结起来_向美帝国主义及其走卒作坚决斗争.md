Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 11th: The Japanese Communist Party's organ "Akahata" published an editorial today, calling on the Japanese people to unite with the people of China and Korea and all the people of Asia to resolutely launch a struggle against the common enemy of all Asian people, US imperialism and its running dogs.

The editorial said that the massive rally of one million people from all walks of life in Beijing on the 9th, opposing the US-Japan military alliance and supporting the Japanese people's struggle, was a grand assembly of the Chinese people to encourage and support the Japanese people.

"Akahata" pointed out that the Japanese people are different from what they were before the war. Promoting friendship with China and striving for peace, independence, democracy, and neutrality are the wishes of the Japanese people. No force in the world can destroy the unity between the Japanese and Chinese people.

"Akahata" emphasized that the Japanese people's struggle to prevent the Diet from ratifying the new "Security Treaty" is a struggle against US imperialism and the traitorous, reactionary forces in Japan. The Japanese people must unremittingly develop this struggle. Only in this way can they unite with the great Chinese people, the heroic Korean people, and all the people of Asia to advance toward final victory together.

"Akahata" called on all JCP members to convey the situation and firm will of the Chinese people's rally to all Japanese people, and called on them to join hands with the people of China and Korea to launch a resolute struggle against the common enemy, US imperialism.
