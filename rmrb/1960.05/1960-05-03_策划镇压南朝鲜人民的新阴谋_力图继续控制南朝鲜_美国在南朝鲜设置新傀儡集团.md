Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 30th: Seoul dispatch: U.S. imperialism and the new puppet group it has just installed in South Korea to replace Syngman Rhee are stepping up their planning of new conspiracies to suppress the South Korean people and measures to ensure continued U.S. economic control and plunder of South Korea.

It is reported that U.S. Ambassador McConaughy held his first official meeting on the 29th with Huh Chung, the so-called "acting president" of South Korea, since the so-called "caretaker government" he organized came to power. After the meeting, the U.S. Ambassador told reporters that the new Huh Chung "government" should receive full U.S. support and is willing to accept (U.S.) support. He also revealed that the meeting discussed the so-called "responsibilities and status for defense and security" of the U.S. military commander in South Korea, Magruder. He did not elaborate on this, but it is believed to be related to the U.S. plan to intensify its military control over South Korea and use the U.S. invading forces to suppress the South Korean people.

A joint statement issued by both sides after the talks announced that the United States would immediately resume "aid" to the South Korean puppet group, which had been temporarily suspended since the beginning of this week after the Korean people launched a large-scale struggle. On the other hand, Huh Chung told the U.S. side that "he will instruct the new 'Minister of Reconstruction' to take measures to ensure the elimination of administrative obstacles to free competition in procurement," in order to facilitate the dumping of U.S. goods. Both sides also expressed their intention to "take measures to conduct closer integration and joint planning in terms of overall resources," that is, to allow the United States to further control South Korea's resources.

Thus, the so-called South Korean "caretaker government" headed by Huh Chung completely exposed itself as being exactly the same as Syngman Rhee, a proxy and lackey of U.S. imperialism.

On the one hand, the newly installed puppet group is stepping up its collusion with the United States. On the other hand, it is superficially taking some "reform" measures according to U.S. instructions, such as the establishment of a nine-member committee by the pseudo-"National Assembly" to draft amendments to the "constitution" in order to implement the so-called "cabinet system"; replacing the "governors" of nine provinces and some "police chiefs," in an attempt to deceive public opinion and soften and paralyze the struggle of the South Korean people.

But at the same time, Huh Chung clamored that "the government's most urgent task is to restore law and order." While abolishing the so-called "Special Intelligence Section," the South Korean police agency added a "Anti-Communist Section," attempting to strengthen the suppression of patriots.

The U.S. conspiracy to replace an old running dog with a new puppet is obvious. A spokesman for the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan in Tokyo said that the United States would try to "create another Syngman Rhee." He pointed out the "anti-American sentiment in people's hearts" reflected in the South Korean people's struggle, and exposed the U.S. conspiracy to use Syngman Rhee as a "scapegoat." The spokesman said that Syngman Rhee's resignation did not bring "any hope" for the unification of Korea.

### 策划镇压南朝鲜人民的新阴谋　力图继续控制南朝鲜  美国在南朝鲜设置新傀儡集团

    策划镇压南朝鲜人民的新阴谋　力图继续控制南朝鲜
    美国在南朝鲜设置新傀儡集团
    新华社平壤30日电　汉城消息：美帝国主义同它刚刚在南朝鲜设置的用来代替李承晚的新的傀儡集团，正在加紧策划镇压南朝鲜人民的新阴谋和保证美国在经济上继续控制和掠夺南朝鲜的措施。
    据报道，美国大使麦康瑙吉在29日同南朝鲜所谓“代理总统”许政举行了他组织的所谓“看守政府”上台以来第一次正式会议。美国大使在会后对新闻记者说，新的许政“政府”应受美国充分的支持，并且愿意接受（美国的）支持。他还透露，会议讨论了侵占南朝鲜的美军司令马格鲁德对南朝鲜的所谓“防御和安全所负的责任和地位”。他对此没有作详细说明，但这被认为同美国准备在军事上加紧控制南朝鲜、利用美国侵略军镇压南朝鲜人民的阴谋有关。
    会谈后双方发表的联合声明宣布，美国立即恢复在向朝鲜人民展开大规模斗争后从本星期初暂时停止的对南朝鲜傀儡集团的“援助”。另一方面，许政向美国方面表示，“他将指示新任‘复兴部长官’采取措施，保证取消诸如自由竞争的采购方面的行政障碍”，以利于美国商品的倾销。双方还表示要“采取措施在总的资源方面进行更密切的结合和共同规划”，也就是说让美国进一步掌握南朝鲜的资源。
    这样，以许政为首的所谓南朝鲜“看守政府”就彻底暴露了自己同李承晚一模一样，是美帝国主义的代理人和奴才。
    新上台的傀儡集团一方面加紧勾结美国，另一方面，按照美国的指示正在表面上采取一些“改革”措施，如由伪“国会”成立一个九人委员会起草修改“宪法”以便实行所谓“内阁制”；更调九个道的“道知事”和一些“警察局长”等，企图借以欺骗舆论，软化和麻痹南朝鲜人民的斗争。
    但是同时，许政叫嚣，“政府最紧迫的任务是恢复法律和秩序”。南朝鲜警察机构在撤销所谓“特殊情报科”的同时，添设了“反共科”，企图加强对爱国者的镇压。
    美国用一个新的傀儡来代替老的走狗的阴谋昭然若揭。东京的旅日朝鲜人总联合会的一个发言人说，美国会设法“制造另一个李承晚”。他指出在南朝鲜人民斗争中反应出来的“人们内心的反美情绪”，并揭露美国想把李承晚当作“替罪羊”的阴谋。这位发言人说，李承晚的辞职并没有为朝鲜的统一带来“什么希望”。
