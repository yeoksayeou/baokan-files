    Technical Innovation Has No End
    The Yangtze River, however deep, has a bottom;
    Breaking superstitions has no bottom;
    The sea, however wide, has a shore;
    Liberating thought has no shore;
    The mountain, however high, has a peak;
    The production leap forward has no peak;
    The river, however long, has a source;
    Technical innovation has no end.
    Worker of Shanghai Electric Motor Factory Chen Minqiang

    技术革新没尽头
    江再深，也有底，
    破除迷信没有底；海再宽，也有边，
    解放思想没有边；山再高，也有顶，
    生产跃进没有顶；河再长，也有头，
    技术革新没尽头。
    上海电机厂工人　　陈民强
