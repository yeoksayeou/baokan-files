Spring in the Nursing Home
　　A peach blossom branch planted in a vase,
　　Hoary hair reflecting a rosy face;
　　The people's commune has a beautiful spring,
　　Happy seniors with smiling faces.

　　Bees dance before the green window,
　　Wishing to gather sweet nectar from the peach blossoms;
　　How can flower nectar compare to the sweetness of the heart,
　　The heart flower is even more beautiful than the peach blossom.

　　Jiang Wenbin (painting) Lu Xiucan (poem) (with picture)

    敬老院之春一枝桃花瓶里栽，苍苍白发映红颜；人民公社春光好，幸福老人笑颜开。蜜蜂飞舞碧窗前，欲向桃花采蜜甜；花蜜何如心蜜好，心花更比桃花艳。蒋文彬画　卢秀灿诗（附图片）
