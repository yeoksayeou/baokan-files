High-Speed Steel Seizing Record

Our reporters Wang Wenliang and Zhao Yongxi

Before January of this year, the steelmaking area of Baotou Steel, apart from a few gray concrete pillars, was still an uneven wasteland. In what seemed like no time at all, it is now lined with factory buildings, and Baotou Steel's No. 1 giant open-hearth furnace, known as the "King of Open-Hearth Furnaces," has already produced steel.

Baotou Steel has produced steel, and in this moment of jubilation, one cannot help but recall the past battles.

Learn from Wuhan Steel, Compete with Wuhan Steel

January 28th was the Spring Festival of 1960. While people were celebrating the festival in warm and comfortable dormitories and in the newly decorated employee clubs, the Baotou Steel steelmaking area was filled with a vibrant scene of labor.

The workers of the No. 1 Engineering Team of the Baotou Steel Metal Structure Company, who had created five miracles in the construction of Baotou Steel's No. 1 blast furnace and were known as "Eagles," arrived at the open-hearth furnace construction site early in the morning. Sun Baoyuan, a famous advanced producer and Communist Party member, immediately said to the workers in his group: In the new year, we must learn from Wuhan Steel, catch up with Wuhan Steel, and surpass Wuhan Steel, and guarantee to complete the equipment and structure installation of No. 1 open-hearth furnace in one hundred and ninety-two hours. Before he finished speaking, Zheng Enchang, a master worker nearing fifty, and Wang Xuanyi, a young tiger general, immediately followed up, saying: No need for one hundred and ninety-two hours, we want to create high speed and only use one hundred and eighty hours.

The story was this: Before this, Wuhan Steel workers had built three large open-hearth furnaces and created many new records for rapid construction. For this reason, Baotou Steel workers were eager to try. At the beginning of the furnace construction, they set ambitious goals, determined to learn from Wuhan Steel workers and compete with them.

The competition between the two major steel plants in the North and South began. The large tower crane, more than seventy meters high, began to dance its iron arms, hoisting huge metal components and swinging them back and forth; in the sky, riveting guns clattered and electric welding burst into beautiful sparks; on the ground, the red flags directing the cranes waved non-stop, and from time to time, bursts of crisp whistles were heard. Look, the installation team of Yu Qinglong had a clear division of labor, each in charge of their own tasks, working closely together, and completing sixteen hours of work in the first four hours. Sun Baoyuan created a multi-hook lifting method, with one hook doing the work of five, increasing efficiency several times. The open-hearth furnace installation was progressing rapidly, and it looked like the 940-ton furnace body installation would be completed on schedule in another thirty-six hours. Suddenly, it was discovered that the flat steel supports were all leaning to the south, and the top plate being hoisted could not be riveted on; if this hurdle could not be overcome, the remaining two hundred tons of equipment could not be installed; the plan to learn from Wuhan Steel, catch up with Wuhan Steel, and surpass Wuhan Steel would fall through. How worrying! The Party branch immediately convened a three-in-one meeting. Time passed minute by minute, and the workers' hearts were churning. At this time, the old foreman Yu Huishen made a suggestion: "We want to compete with Wuhan Steel, and it will be too late to correct them one by one. My opinion is to correct the whole thing." What a bold suggestion! The open-hearth furnace body has a total of twenty-eight flat steel columns, connected by more than four hundred tons of steel components; what method can be used to move such a heavy thing? The workers were racking their brains, and a feasible method soon came out. The workers prepared tools overnight, and succeeded in correcting the whole thing at noon the next day. It took a total of only eight days and ten hours to complete the open-hearth furnace body installation, which was five days and two hours shorter than the fast installation record of Wuhan Steel's No. 3 open-hearth furnace.

Chimney Points Straight to the Sky

Before the open-hearth furnace installation project was completed, another strong force came up. In mid-February, the workers of the No. 4 Furnace Building Team of Baotou Steel wrote their bold words on the construction well frame of the 100-meter chimney site of No. 1 open-hearth furnace: "Surpass Wuhan Steel, Fight the Severe Cold, Winter Construction Beats Summer; Strive for Nine Days, Guarantee Ten Days, 100-Meter Chimney Reaches the Clouds!"

A 100-meter reinforced concrete chimney is not an ordinary project. It is a vertical high-altitude operation, with the diameter of the lowest part being only seven and a half meters, and it becomes thinner as it goes up, with the diameter of the top being only three and a half meters. The construction area is very small, and more than 460 cubic meters of concrete and more than 50 tons of steel bars need to be built up section by section. According to the old technical specifications, the electric heating method was used for winter construction, which also required eighty days. Now, the workers of the No. 4 Furnace Building Team want to complete it within ten days. How easy is that!

The workers of the No. 4 Furnace Building Team of Baotou Steel have lofty ambitions and must surpass Wuhan Steel. How to compete? First of all, they seriously studied the rapid construction experience of Wuhan Steel workers and decided to adopt the chain-type wooden formwork continuous pouring method created by Wuhan Steel workers. However, the climate in Baotou is cold, the old electric heating method is too slow, and the concrete "curing" speed cannot keep up. What to do? After studying it, they finally came up with a method and succeeded after testing. Then, around the new electric heating method, everyone came up with ideas and put together a complete winter construction plan. As soon as they said they would do it, they started doing it, tying steel bars, supporting formwork, making ash, tamping, connecting wires, and removing formwork. There were eight or nine layers of people working at the same time up and down, and the concrete pouring project was rising rapidly. The result of competing with Wuhan Steel was: it was completed in nine days and nineteen and a half hours, which was more than two days shorter than Wuhan Steel. The quality is excellent, and there has been no cracking phenomenon since the fire was lit and smoke was released.

Large-Scale Collaboration Creates High Speed

High speed requires large-scale collaboration. Moving examples of catching up with each other and helping each other are circulating everywhere on the construction site.

Late at night on January 4th of this year, the workers of an advanced concrete team of the Third Construction Site of the Second Engineering Company of Baotou Steel - Yao Fuming's team, walked through the snow in the severe winter, and came to the foundation pit of the open-hearth furnace in high spirits. A poem was circulating among them: "The Red Army is not afraid of the Long March, we are not afraid of the cold in Sai Bei, as long as the steel water flows on May Day, we would rather have our sweat float a boat." It seems that they are full of confidence in the battle of the "King of Open-Hearth Furnaces."

But when they came to the dense steel bars, they couldn't help but be stunned. It turned out that the blackboard newspaper announced the daytime results: their team's day shift was behind Ming Jianfeng's team. Although they only poured five cubic meters less, this is a competition! No, we have to catch up!

Speaking of Ming Jianfeng's team, it is also an advanced team of the Third Construction Site. From the time the first shovel of soil was dug for the Baotou Steel "King of Open-Hearth Furnaces" project, the two teams signed a competition contract. When matched rivals meet, of course, they will not give in to each other.

Yao Fuming looked north and saw that the night shift workers of Ming Jianfeng's team had also started working. So, he readjusted the labor organization and threw himself into the battle. Two hours passed, and Yao Fuming's team caught up with Ming Jianfeng's team again. But, strange! Through the dark night sky, under the illumination of the spotlights, the workers of Ming Jianfeng's team were working very happily. Why were they behind? Yao Fuming quietly walked over to take a look. It turned out that Ming Jianfeng's team had seven or eight fewer people today, and as the project progressed, the distance to transport the concrete was getting farther and farther. If they couldn't break through, it would not only affect the progress of the entire project, but also affect the quality of the project. A thought flashed through Yao Fuming's mind like lightning: The red flag of the competition was about to be won. For the red flag? Or for the progress of the entire project? He thought again: We will build the world's first-class large open-hearth furnace on this foundation. No! We must never sacrifice the quality of the project just for the red flag of one team. He turned around and returned to his team, immediately selected ten young and strong lads, removed three chutes from under his own funnel, and went to support Ming Jianfeng's team with people and tools. This time, although Yao Fuming's team did not create a new pouring record, the two teams jointly overfulfilled the daily plan by 20%, and the three-day foundation pouring task was completed in two days, and the project quality was excellent.

A Young Engineering Team

On the open-hearth furnace construction site, everyone knows that there is a young engineering team, which is the Third Engineering Team of the Furnace Building Company. It is said to be young because this team has only been established for a full year. Also, because more than 97% of the five hundred workers are young men who just came from the countryside a year ago. But it is this construction team with little experience that has continuously refreshed and created many new records in the construction of the main flue, branch flue, slag settling chamber, and regenerator chamber of the open-hearth furnace. Finally, they also used more than three days to complete the 650 tons of refractory bricks in the smelting chamber of the open-hearth furnace, which was two and a half days faster than the fastest construction record of Wuhan Steel workers.

How did they create miracles? Let's start from the beginning. This young furnace building team encountered difficulties when they first started preparing for the open-hearth furnace masonry project. For example, because the team was just established, there were not enough construction tools, and sometimes they even had to borrow a shovel from other units; there were not enough belt conveyors for transporting refractory bricks, and they had to hire horse-drawn carts to help transport bricks to the open-hearth furnace. At this time, the other several earlier established engineering teams of the Furnace Building Company, as if they had agreed in advance, came to support the Third Team with their respective rosters and material lists, beating gongs and drums. As soon as they came, they made a guarantee to this "little brother": As long as the open-hearth furnace project can go up, we will provide people and materials. The entire staff of the Third Furnace Building Team was deeply moved by this noble communist style. At that time, the civil construction of the open-hearth furnace had not yet ended. If the civil construction did not go up, the metal structure workers could not install the structure, and if the structure was not installed, the furnace building project could not begin. Therefore, on the one hand, with the help of brother teams, they actively processed refractory bricks, carried out pre-installation outside the furnace, and organized a general rehearsal before construction; on the other hand, they organized a group of workers to go into battle early, helping the civil construction workers to plaster the floor, dismantle the formwork, and clean up the site, creating conditions for the rapid construction of the entire steelmaking project. Some new workers with lower technical skills worked during the day and studied technology at night, diligently studying and practicing, determined to use outstanding achievements to answer the support of brother units. Sure enough, on the fifth day of the start of the flue project, they created a new record of completing 916 cubic meters of refractory bricks in four days and twenty-three hours. Then, they achieved successive victories in the construction of the slag settling chamber and regenerator chamber, and also used methods such as three fixings (fixing people, fixing teams, and fixing parts), pre-installation, and multi-layer simultaneous masonry to create a new national record for rapid masonry of large open-hearth furnace smelting chambers, and in the case that the masonry project of the furnace wall and furnace bottom had not yet started and the furnace top equipment was urgently needed to be installed in advance, they boldly reversed the construction sequence, first building the furnace top, supporting the metal structure company workers to complete the furnace top installation task in advance.

    高速度夺钢记
    本报记者　王文亮　赵永西
    今年1月份以前，包钢的炼钢区，除了几根灰色混凝土柱子外，还是一片坑洼不平的荒滩。曾几何时，如今，这里已是厂房林立，号称“平炉之王”的包钢一号巨型平炉已经出钢了。
    包钢出钢了，在这欢腾的时刻，不禁使人想起了战斗的过去。
    学武钢　赛武钢
    1月28日，是1960年的春节。当人们在温暖舒适的宿舍里，在修饰一新的职工俱乐部里欢度佳节的时候，在包钢炼钢区，却到处是一幅热气腾腾的劳动景象。
    修建包钢一号高炉曾经五次创造奇迹、被人们称为“雄鹰”的包钢金属结构公司第一工程队的工人们，一清早就来到平炉工地。著名的先进生产者、共产党员孙宝元一上阵，就冲着小组工人们说：在新的一年里，我们一定要学武钢、赶武钢、超武钢，保证用一百九十二个小时完成一号平炉的设备、结构安装任务。他的话还没落音，年近半百的郑恩昌老师傅、青年虎将王选义立即接上去说：不用一百九十二，我们要创造高速度，只用一百八十小时。
    事情原来是这样：在这以前，武钢职工先后建成了三座大平炉，并且创造了许多快速施工新纪录。为此，包钢职工跃跃欲试。建炉一开始，他们就立下了雄心壮志，一定要向武钢职工学习，并同他们比比高低。
    南北两大钢厂的对手赛开始了。身高七十多米的大塔吊开始舞动它的铁胳臂，吊起巨大的金属构件，颤悠悠地挥来挥去；天空中，铆枪哒哒作响，电焊爆出美丽的火花；地面上指挥吊车的红旗不停地摆动，不时传来一阵阵清脆的哨音。看吧，安装工于庆隆小队分工明确，各管一行，紧密协作，头四个小时就干完了十六个小时的工作量。孙宝元创造了一钩多吊法，一钩顶五钩，提高效率几倍。平炉安装在迅速进展着，眼看再有三十六个小时就要按计划完成重达九百四十吨的平炉炉体安装任务了。突然发现扁钢支柱都向南倾斜，吊起来的顶盘铆不上去；过不了这一关，其余二百多吨设备就安不上；学武钢、赶武钢、超武钢的计划就会落空，多么令人着急呀！党总支立即召开了三结合会议。时间在一分一秒地过去，工人们心里都在上下翻腾。这时候，老工长于会申提出了一个建议：“咱们要赛武钢，一根一根地找正来不及，我的意见是整体找正。”好一个大胆的建议！平炉炉体一共有二十八根扁钢柱子，连接的钢铁构件有四百多吨；用什么办法才能挪动这么重的家伙呢？工人们在动脑筋，可行的办法很快就出来了。工人们连夜准备工具，第二天中午十二点就一次找正成功。总共只用八天零十小时完成了平炉炉体安装任务，比武钢三号平炉快速安装纪录还缩短了五天零两小时。
    烟囱直指青天
    平炉安装工程还没有干完，另一支劲旅又上来了。2月中旬，包钢筑炉四队职工，在一号平炉百米烟囱工地的施工竖井架上，用斗大的字写下了他们的豪言壮语：“超武钢，战严寒，冬季施工胜夏天；争九天，保十天，百米烟囱入云端！”
    百米钢筋混凝土烟囱，这可不是一般工程。它是垂直的高空作业，最下部的直径只有七米五，越往上越细，到最顶上直径只有三米五，施工面积非常狭小，四百六十多立方米混凝土和五十多吨钢筋，要一节一节往上修。根据旧的技术规范，冬季施工采用电力加热法，也需要八十天。现在，筑炉四队的工人要在十天之内修完它，谈何容易！
    包钢筑炉四队工人壮志凌云，一定要赛过武钢。怎么赛呢？首先是认真学习了武钢职工的快速施工经验，决定采用武钢工人创造的节链式木模板连续浇灌法。可是，包头的气候寒冷，旧的电力加热法太慢，混凝土“养生”速度跟不上。怎么办？研究来，研究去，终于想出一个办法，经过试验，成功了。接着，围绕新的电力加热法，大家你一计，我一计，又配成了一套完整的冬季施工方案。说干就干，绑钢筋的、支模板的、打灰的、捣固的、接电线的、撤模板的，上上下下有八、九层人同时作业，混凝土浇灌工程迅速上升。赛武钢的结果是：九天零十九个半小时就完成了，比武钢缩短两天多。质量是优等的，点火通烟以来，一处裂纹现象也没有。
    大协作创造高速度
    高速度需要大协作。工地上到处都在传诵着你追我赶、既赛又帮的感人事例。
    今年1月4日深夜，包钢第二工程公司三工地的一个先进混凝土小队——姚福明小队的工人，踏着严冬的积雪，精神抖擞地来到平炉的基础坑里。他们中间流传着这样一首诗：“红军不怕远征难，我们不畏塞北寒，只要五一流钢水，宁愿汗水漂起船。”看来，他们对大战“平炉王”信心百倍。
    但他们一来到密密麻麻的钢筋前面，不由得心里一怔。原来，黑板报上公布了白天的战绩：他们队的白班拉在明建丰队的后面了。虽然只少浇灌了五立方米，但这是在竞赛啊！不行，得追上去！
    提起明建丰队来，也是三工地的一个先进小队。从包钢“平炉王”工程挖第一锹土起，两个小队就签订了竞赛合同。棋逢对手，将遇良才，当然各不相让。
    姚福明向北一看，明建丰队夜班工人也上班来了。于是，他重新调整了一下劳动组织，就投入了战斗。两个小时过去了，姚福明队又赶过了明建丰小队。但是，奇怪！透过漆黑的夜空，在聚光灯的照耀下，只见明建丰队的工人们干得很欢，他们为什么落后了呢？姚福明悄悄地走过去一看，原来明建丰队今天少了七、八个人，再加上随着工程的进展，混凝土的运距愈来愈远了。如果再突不上去，不但会影响整个工程进度，而且要影响工程质量。一个念头闪电似地通过姚福明的脑际：对手赛的红旗眼看就要拿到手了。为红旗呢？还是为整个工程进度？他又想：我们在这个基础上将建设世界上第一流的大平炉。不！绝不能只为了一个队的红旗，就不顾工程质量。他转身回到队里，立即选拔了十名年青力壮的小伙子，从自己的漏斗下面拆下三个串筒，连人带工具，一起支援明建丰小队去了。这次，姚福明小队虽然没有创造出新的浇灌纪录，但两个小队却共同超额20％完成了日计划，三天的基础浇灌任务两天就完成了，工程质量优良。
    一支年轻的工程队
    在平炉工地，人人都知道有一个年轻的工程队，这就是筑炉公司第三工程队。说它年轻，是因为这个队成立刚满一周年。还由于五百多名工人中，97％以上都是一年前刚从农村来的小伙子。但就是这支经验少的施工队伍，在平炉总烟道、支烟道、沉渣室、蓄热室的施工中，却连续刷新和创造了许多新纪录。最后，他们又以三天多时间，砌完了平炉熔炼室的六百五十吨耐火砖，比武钢职工最快的施工纪录还快两天半。
    他们是怎样创造奇迹的呢？话要从头说起。这支年轻的筑炉队伍，在平炉砌筑工程刚着手施工准备的时候，就遇到了困难。例如，因为队刚成立，施工工具不足，有时甚至用一把铁锹也得向外单位借；运耐火砖的皮带机不够用，得雇用马车帮着往平炉运砖才行。就在这时候，筑炉公司其他几个成立较早的工程队，好像事先约定好一样，都带着各自的花名册、材料单，敲锣打鼓，支援三队来了。他们一来，就向这个“小弟弟”提出保证：只要平炉工程能上去，要人有人，要材料有材料。筑炉三队全体职工被这种高贵的共产主义风格深深地感动了。那时，平炉土建工程还没有结束，土建工程上不去，金属结构工人就无法安装结构，结构安不上，筑炉工程就不能开始。于是，他们一方面在兄弟队的帮助下，积极加工耐火砖，进行炉外预安装，组织施工前的总演习；一方面，组织一批工人提前上阵，帮助土建工人抹地坪，拆模板，清理现场，为整个炼钢工程快速施工创造条件。一些技术较低的新工人，白天工作，晚上学习技术，勤学苦练，决心用出色的成就回答兄弟单位的支援。果然，在烟道工程开工的第五天，他们就创造了四天二十三小时砌完九百一十六立方米耐火砖的新纪录。接着，他们在沉渣室、蓄热室施工中又连战连捷，还用三定（定人、定小队、定部位）、预安装、多层同时砌筑等办法创造了全国大型平炉熔炼室快速砌筑新纪录，并且在炉墙、炉底的砌砖工程还没有动工而炉顶设备又急需提前安装的情况下，大胆颠倒工序，先砌炉顶，支援金属结构公司工人提前完成了炉顶安装任务。
