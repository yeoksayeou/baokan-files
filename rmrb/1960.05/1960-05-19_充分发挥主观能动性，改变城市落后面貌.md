Give Full Play to Subjective Initiative and Change the Backward Appearance of the City
Fang Zhenhua, Secretary of the Anqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China

Twenty-two years ago, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in "On Protracted War": Strategically, we must fight one against ten, fight the few against the many, and achieve more with less; but tactically, we must adhere to fighting ten against one, fighting the many against the few, and achieving more with more. This dialectical unity principle of combining strategy and tactics, put forward by Comrade Mao Zedong, has formed an extremely famous formula in China's long revolutionary struggle, that is: strategically, we must despise all enemies, and tactically, we must take all enemies seriously. Comrade Mao Zedong's brilliant thought has victoriously guided China's revolution and construction. It not only developed the Marxist-Leninist theory of class struggle, but also serves as a guide for all our production struggles and socialist construction.

To despise difficulties, we must first have a firm belief in the victory of the revolutionary and construction cause we are engaged in and a spirit of heroic fearlessness, that is, we must have revolutionary ambition and drive. Although Anqing City has a history of more than 700 years since its establishment, due to the long-term oppression and exploitation by the reactionary ruling class, industrial production was pitifully small at the time of liberation. Three small enterprises, with a total of less than 200 employees, had outdated equipment, backward technology, and an annual output value of only about 1.9 million yuan. The rural land was barren, and the grain yield per mu was only 200 to 300 catties. The entire city was scarred and the people's livelihood was declining. In response to such a dilapidated situation, at the beginning of the first five-year plan, some people complained about the poor geographical conditions, believing that it was not a key area for national and provincial construction, and felt that industrial development had no future, resulting in pessimism and disappointment. However, under the education of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the city's Party organizations, under the leadership of the provincial and prefectural Party committees, led the broad masses of people, established the grand ambition of thoroughly changing Anqing's backward appearance as a consumer city, formulated long-term and short-term development plans, and issued the call to "struggle to build Anqing City into a new industrial city." On the industrial front, the mysterious view of running industry was broken, and the slogan of self-reliance and mass participation in running local industries by the whole Party and the entire people was put forward; in agriculture, it was required to achieve “hundred” (hundred catties of cotton), “thousand” (thousand catties of grain), and “ten thousand” (ten thousand catties of sugarcane) per mu, with the goal of achieving the national agricultural development program ahead of schedule and exceeding the target. Through the concerted efforts and arduous struggle of the people of the city, we have finally realized the continuous Great Leap Forward since 1958. Hundreds of local industries and street-run industries sprang up like mushrooms; the total industrial output value in 1959 (excluding street industries) increased by more than 87 times compared with the time of liberation; thousands of light and heavy industrial products bloomed like flowers, vying for beauty. The unit area yield of grain and cotton exceeded the targets set by the National Agricultural Development Program ten years and eight years ahead of schedule, respectively. Not only was the rural area fully communized, but also the urban residents were all organized into urban people's communes. The face of urban construction is changing with each passing day, and the people's living standards have been significantly improved. Obviously, all these great achievements would have been unimaginable without the education and guidance of the Party's general line for socialist construction and without the lofty ambitions and indomitable spirit of the broad masses of people under the leadership of the Party to despise difficulties.

Whether or not to dare to despise difficulties depends on whether people dare to give full play to subjective initiative. Comrade Mao Zedong made the most incisive exposition of the subjective dynamic role of people in "On Protracted War." He said: "Conscious dynamism is a characteristic of human beings." He also said: "Those who direct the war cannot expect victory beyond the limits permitted by objective conditions, but they can and must actively strive for victory within the limits of objective conditions. The stage for the activities of war commanders must be built on the permission of objective conditions, but they can use this stage to direct many colorful, majestic and magnificent dramas." The attitude towards difficulties is the touchstone of heroes and cowards, and ultimately it is also the division between the proletarian dialectical materialist world outlook and the bourgeois idealist world outlook. In the process of vigorously developing local industries and organizing a great leap forward in production, conditionists complained that there was no funds, no equipment, no raw materials, and no technology, and sighed that "it is difficult for a clever woman to cook without rice." Some people often have right-leaning conservative ideas such as "potential has been exhausted" and "production increase has reached the top" in production. They are often intimidated by some local and temporary difficulties, and they are timid in the face of battle. In the eyes of dialectical materialists, the difficulties we encounter in the cause of transforming society and transforming nature are difficulties in progress and difficulties in development. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "There are difficulties, there are solutions, and there is hope." In our revolutionary and construction cause, favorable conditions are always the main ones, and difficulties are always one finger out of ten. Marxists-Leninists also believe that the favorable and unfavorable conditions, "difficulty" and "ease," are a dialectical relationship of unity of opposites. Under certain conditions, through people's subjective efforts, difficulties and unfavorable conditions can move towards their opposite. Comrade Mao Zedong clearly pointed out in "On Contradiction": "In some times of revolutionary struggle, difficult conditions exceed smooth conditions. At this time, difficulty is the main aspect of the contradiction, and smoothness is the secondary aspect. However, due to the efforts of revolutionaries, they can gradually overcome difficulties and develop a new situation of smoothness, and the difficult situation gives way to the smooth situation." The fact is also true, we have a very good opposite to illustrate the above issues. Anqing City Yarn Factory and Mercerized Dyeing and Weaving Factory are new factories established during the Great Leap Forward. The yarn factory is an enterprise built with state investment. Twenty-five machines were purchased from the old factory in Shanghai, and 27 technicians were also supported by Shanghai. The conditions are not bad. However, due to the serious fear of difficulties among some leaders, they believed that the machines were old and raw materials were difficult, and they stopped moving forward. Therefore, this factory failed to complete its plan month after month for more than a quarter in 1959 until the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Central Committee was implemented. The Mercerized Dyeing and Weaving Factory started as a subsidiary factory led by a cooperative factory. At the time of preparation, there was only a dilapidated temple-like house, five workers, and an old machine. Compared with the conditions of the yarn factory, it can be said that there is a world of difference. However, due to the towering ambitions of the proletariat of the leading cadres and all the workers of the factory, they relied on such a stage to give full play to "conscious dynamism," overcome obstacles, and start from scratch. Therefore, this factory built more than 6,000 square meters of factory buildings in more than a year, and made 66 iron and wooden machines by themselves, realizing a great leap forward in production. By the end of 1959, the number of employees had reached more than 200, and the production plan was overfulfilled every quarter. The products had developed from a single winding to weaving towels, bed sheets, and other more than 30 kinds, and four of them had been sold overseas. They really directed a colorful, majestic and magnificent drama, as Comrade Mao Zedong said.

Despising difficulties strategically and paying attention to difficulties tactically is the combination of subjective initiative and objective regularity, and the unity of revolutionary spirit and realistic spirit. To develop local industries and organize a sustained leap forward in production, from a strategic point of view, we must abandon the mysterious view of running industry, adhere to the leap forward indicators, and constantly stimulate the enthusiasm of the masses; but from a tactical point of view, that is, from the point of view of each specific issue, we must also take effective methods to do the work carefully bit by bit. Comrade Mao Zedong paid great attention to work methods. In "Concern for the Well-being of the Masses, Pay Attention to Work Methods," he wrote profoundly and vividly: "Our task is to cross the river, but we cannot cross without a bridge or a boat. If the problem of the bridge or the boat is not solved, crossing the river is just empty talk. Without solving the problem of methods, the task is just a blind talk." How to pay attention to work methods, value and overcome difficulties in organizing a great leap forward in industrial production? In studying Comrade Mao Zedong's works, we have the following preliminary experiences.

First of all, attach importance to investigation and research, constantly find out the laws of movement and development, prepare early, and take the initiative. In the Great Leap Forward, according to Comrade Mao Zedong's instruction of "three years to see the first year, the first year to see the previous winter," we paid attention to making early arrangements for production plans and production organization work, striving to take the initiative, grasping the current production and preparing for the next production. In the past, many departments or enterprises issued plans too late, and employees reflected that "there is no news at the beginning of the month, and people are anxious at the end of the month," resulting in the "old routine" of loose front and tight rear in production. In June 1959, the city held a five-level cadre meeting on industry and transportation and capital construction to emphasize this education, so that most enterprises could arrange production plans in advance and arrange production organization work early, thus completing the third quarter plan eight days ahead of schedule, completing the annual production plan twenty-three days ahead of schedule, and realizing a good start in 1960.

To do a good job of advance planning and preparation, we must not only grasp today with one hand and tomorrow with the other, but also check frequently during the execution of the plan, discover problems, and solve them in time. Only in this way can we "assess the situation and judge the time" and turn passivity into initiative.

Secondly, conscientiously implement the leadership method of combining leadership with the masses, go deep into reality, go from point to surface, and carry out meticulous organizational work. To value and overcome difficulties in production, we must also grasp the regularity of the development of objective things, so that people's subjective understanding is consistent with objective reality. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in "Strategic Issues in China's Revolutionary War": "No matter what you do, if you don't understand the situation of that thing, its nature, its connection with things outside it, you don't know the law of that thing, you don't know how to do it, and you can't do that thing well." In leading industrial production, we often organize leaders at all levels to go deep into the front line of production, follow the shift, plant experimental fields, and conscientiously implement the method of combining leaders, workers, and technicians to make economic work more and more meticulous. For example, in this year's technical revolution movement centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, the Grain Party Committee selected the manual tofu workshop and the highly mechanized oil and flour factory as experimental fields. The secretary went to the factory to help specifically, concentrated his efforts, and attacked the key points. Therefore, in just over 20 days, the degree of mechanization of the tofu workshop increased by 60%; the oil and flour factory fought for half a month and realized automated production in four workshops, and three of them realized continuous production. After these two experimental fields were made as examples, we also held on-site meetings in a timely manner, organized visits and studies, and rapidly pushed the technical revolution movement of the entire system to a climax, so that the degree of mechanization was improved by 16% compared with the end of 1959.

Countless facts have shown us such a truth: Mao Zedong Thought is a glorious banner of invincibility. Persisting in Comrade Mao Zedong's thought of strategically despising the enemy (difficulties) and tactically valuing the enemy (difficulties) in all work is an important guarantee for implementing the general line of socialist construction. We have not studied and researched Mao Zedong's works enough in the past, and we must further strengthen it in the future, and better implement and apply it in actual work, and constantly improve our ideological awareness and work level.

    充分发挥主观能动性，改变城市落后面貌
    中共安庆市委书记　方振华
    二十二年前，毛泽东同志在“论持久战”中指出：在战略上我们必须以一当十，以寡敌众，以少胜多；但是在战役战术上，我们必须坚持以十当一，以众敌寡，以多胜少。毛泽东同志提出的这个战略和战术相结合的辩证统一原则，在我国的长期革命斗争中，形成了一个极其著名的公式，这就是：在战略上我们要藐视一切敌人，在战术上我们要重视一切敌人。毛泽东同志这一光辉的思想，胜利地指导了中国的革命和建设。它不仅发展了马克思列宁主义阶级斗争的学说，而且也是我们进行一切生产斗争和社会主义建设的指南。
    要藐视困难，首先必须对我们所从事的革命和建设事业具有坚定的必胜信念和英勇无畏的精神，也就是要有革命的志气和干劲。安庆市建城虽有七百余年的历史，但由于反动统治阶级的长期压榨和剥削，解放时工业生产少得可怜。三个小型的企业，职工总数不满二百人，而且设备破旧，技术水平落后，年产值不过一百九十万元左右。农村土地贫瘠，粮食亩产只有二、三百斤。整个城市疮痍满目，民生雕敝。针对这样一个破烂摊子，在第一个五年计划开始时，有些人埋怨地理条件不好，认为它不是国家和全省建设的重点，感到工业发展没有前途，产生悲观失望情绪。但是在党的社会主义建设总路线的教育下，全市党的组织在省委和地委的领导下，带领广大人民群众，树立了彻底改变安庆消费城市落后面貌的宏伟志愿，制订了远景和近期的发展规划，并发出了“为把安庆市建设成为一个新的工业城市而斗争”的号召。在工业战线上，破除了办工业的神秘观点，提出了自力更生，全党全民大办地方工业的口号；在农业上，要求亩产达到百（百斤棉）、千（千斤粮）、万（万斤蔗），以提前超额实现农业发展纲要为目标。经过全市人民排除万难，艰苦奋斗，我们终于实现了1958年以来的持续大跃进。数以百计的地方工业和街道民办工业，如雨后春笋，遍地勃兴；1959年工业总产值（不包括街道工业）比解放时增长了八十七倍多；数以千计的轻、重工业产品，如百花怒放，万紫千红，满园争艳。粮食和棉花单位面积产量，分别提前十年和八年超额实现了全国农业发展纲要所规定的指标。不仅农村全部实现了公社化，而且城市居民也全部组成了城市人民公社。城市建设面貌日新月异，人民生活显著提高。很显然，这一切巨大的成就，如果没有党的社会主义建设总路线的教育和指引，没有在党领导下的广大人民群众藐视困难的雄心壮志和所向披靡的冲天干劲，那是根本不能想像的。
    敢不敢于藐视困难，取决于人们敢不敢于发挥主观能动性。毛泽东同志在“论持久战”中，对于人的主观能动作用作了最精辟的论述。他说：“自觉的能动性是人类的特点。”又说：“指导战争的人们不能超越客观条件许可的限度期求战争的胜利，然而可以而且必须在客观条件的限度之内，能动地争取战争的胜利。战争指挥员活动的舞台，必须建筑在客观条件的许可之上，然而他们凭借这个舞台，却可以导演出很多有声有色、威武雄壮的戏剧来。”对待困难的态度是英雄与懦夫的试金石，归根到底也是无产阶级辩证唯物论的世界观和资产阶级唯心论的世界观的分野。在大办地方工业和组织生产大跃进中，条件论者抱怨一无资金，二无设备，三无原料，四无技术，徒叹“巧妇难为无米之炊”。有的在生产中时时产生“潜力已经挖尽”，“增产已经到顶”的右倾保守思想。他们往往为一些局部的、暂时的困难所吓倒，临阵自馁。在辩证唯物主义者看来，我们在变革社会、改造自然的事业中所遇到的困难，是前进中的困难，发展中的困难。毛泽东同志说：“有困难，有办法，有希望”。在我们的革命和建设事业中，有利的条件总是主要的，困难总是十个指头中的一个指头。马克思列宁主义者还认为，条件的有利和不利，“难”和“易”，是对立统一的辩证关系。在一定的条件下，经过人的主观努力，困难和不利条件可以走向它的反面。毛泽东同志在“矛盾论”中就明确地指出：“革命斗争中的某些时候，困难条件超过顺利条件，在这种时候，困难是矛盾的主要方面，顺利是其次要方面。然而由于革命党人的努力，能够逐步地克服困难，开展顺利的新局面，困难的局面让位于顺利的局面。”事实也正是这样，我们有一个很好的对立面，可以说明以上问题。安庆市纱厂和丝光染织厂，都是在大跃进中建立起来的新厂。纱厂是国家投资兴建的企业，在上海的老厂购置了二十五台机器，工人中有二十七名技工也是上海支援的，条件不算坏。但是，由于部分领导人一度存在严重的畏难情绪，认为机器旧了，原料困难，裹足不前，所以这个厂在1959年连续有一个多季度月月完不成计划，直到贯彻八中全会决议后才有好转。丝光染织厂开始仅是一个合作化工厂带起的子厂，筹建时只有一座破庙似的民房、五名工人、一台旧机器，比之纱厂的条件可说有天壤之别。但是由于领导干部和全厂职工有无产阶级的凌云壮志，就凭借了这样一个舞台，充分发挥了“自觉的能动性”，披荆斩棘，白手起家，所以这个厂在一年多的时间内就修起了厂房六千多平方米，自制铁木机械六十六台，实现了生产大跃进。到1959年底，职工已达到二百余名，生产计划季季超额完成，产品由单一并线发展到织造毛巾、被单等三十余种，其中并已有四种远销国外。他们真像毛泽东同志所说的，演出了有声有色、威武雄壮的戏剧。
    在战略上藐视困难和在战术上重视困难，是主观能动性和客观规律性的结合，是革命精神和求实精神的统一。要发展地方工业，组织生产的持续跃进，在战略的观点上，必须抛弃办工业的神秘观点，坚持跃进指标，不断激发群众的干劲；但在战术的观点上，也即是从每一个具体问题上看来，还必须采取有效的方法，深入细致地将工作一点一点地做好。毛泽东同志十分注意工作方法，他在“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”中深刻而形象地写道：“我们的任务是过河、但是没有桥或没有船就不能过。不解决桥或船的问题，过河就是一句空话。不解决方法问题，任务也只是瞎说一顿。”如何在组织工业生产的大跃进中，注意工作方法，重视和克服困难？在学习毛泽东同志的著作中，我们有如下的初步体会。
    首先，重视调查研究，不断找出运动发展的规律，早作准备，打主动仗。大跃进中，我们根据毛泽东同志“三年看头年，头年看前冬”的指示，注意对生产计划和生产组织工作，早作安排，争取主动，既抓紧当前生产，又抓下一步生产的准备。以前很多部门或企业计划下达过迟，职工反映是：“月初无声息，月底急坏人”，造成生产上前松后紧的“老常规”。1959年6月，全市工交、基建五级干部大会着重对此进行了教育，使大部分企业做到生产计划提前布置，生产组织工作早作安排，因而提前八天完成了第三季度计划，提前二十三天完成了全年生产计划并实现了1960年的开门红。
    要做好事先的计划和准备，既要一手抓今天，一手抓明天；同时还必须在执行计划的过程中，勤加检查，发现问题，及时解决。只有这样，才能“审时度势”，变被动为主动。
    其次，认真贯彻领导与群众相结合的领导方法，深入实际，由点到面，进行细致的组织工作。要重视和战胜生产中的困难，还必须掌握客观事物发展的规律性，使人们的主观认识和客观实际相一致。毛泽东同志在“中国革命战争的战略问题”中指出：“不论做什么事，不懂得那件事的情形，它的性质，它和它以外的事情的关联，就不知道那件事的规律，就不知道如何去做，就不能做好那件事。”在领导工业生产中，我们经常组织各级领导干部，深入生产第一线，跟班劳动，种试验田，并认真实行领导、工人和技术人员三结合的方法，把经济工作越做越细致。例如，在今年以机械化、半机械化和自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革命运动中，粮食党委选择了手工操作的豆腐坊和机械化程度较高的油粉厂作试验田，书记下厂，具体帮助，集中力量，猛攻关键。因此，在短短二十多天中，豆腐作坊机械化程度就提高了60％；油粉厂大战半个月就使四个车间实现了自动化生产，其中并有三个车间实现了生产连续化。这两个试验田做出样子以后，我们又及时召开了现场会议，组织参观学习，把全系统的技术革命运动迅速推向了高潮，从而使机械化程度比1959年底提高了16％。
    无数的事实给我们说明了这样一个真理：毛泽东思想是战无不胜的光辉旗帜，在一切工作中坚持毛泽东同志关于在战略上藐视敌人（困难）和在战术上重视敌人（困难）的思想，是贯彻社会主义建设总路线的一个重要保证。我们过去对毛泽东著作的学习钻研还很不够，今后必须进一步加强，并在实际工作中更好地贯彻运用，不断地提高我们的思想觉悟和工作水平。
