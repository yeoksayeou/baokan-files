We Must Never Harbor Any Illusions About U.S. Imperialism
International Public Opinion Points Out Eisenhower's Speech Once Again Exposed His True Colors

(Dispatch by this newspaper) Public opinion from various countries has been criticizing Eisenhower's speech on May 25th, strongly condemning the aggressive crimes of U.S. imperialism.

Czechoslovakian "Red Right Newspaper" says
America's adventurous policy has not changed

A commentary in the Czechoslovakian "Red Right Newspaper" said that U.S. President Eisenhower's radio address first confirmed his responsibility for the U-2 aircraft provocation and for the full content of the policies it represented, showing that he is continuing to pursue a "position of strength" policy. The commentary pointed out that there is no indication that the U.S. government is changing its adventurous policies.

The commentary pointed out that Eisenhower's insistence on the "position of strength" policy stems from the ambitions of U.S. imperialists to dominate the world. Therefore, Washington is not prepared to "tie" itself down with any agreements.

The commentary continued that the era in which the United States could dominate the world ended with the failure of the Korean War in 1953. The crisis of aggressive treaties and military base systems is exacerbating the crisis of dictatorial systems.

Bulgarian "Agricultural Banner Newspaper" says U.S. imperialism insists on a policy of strength

A commentary in the Bulgarian "Agricultural Banner Newspaper" said: Eisenhower's speech once again proves that Khrushchev's statement in Paris exposing the provocateurs was correct. Eisenhower's speech shows that U.S. imperialists are unwilling to ease international tensions, that they are conspiring to undermine peaceful coexistence, and that they continue to act according to old methods and from the outdated "position of strength."

The Bulgarian "Labor Newspaper" published a commentary saying that Eisenhower's speech once again exposed his true face.

Lebanese "Call of the People" says
U.S. imperialism is the enemy of peace

The Lebanese "Call of the People" pointed out, "Eisenhower's speech is an open war cry, adding fuel to the fire of international tension"; "The U.S. President's speech once again exposes that U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of easing tensions, striving for peace, and defending the sovereignty of other countries, and is the greatest danger threatening the security and independence of all peoples."

The newspaper further pointed out that Eisenhower's speech will undoubtedly make people all over the world even more angry and vigilant towards U.S. imperialism.

Cuban "Hoy" says peace depends on the power of the people of all countries

The Cuban "Hoy" published an editorial saying that Eisenhower's speech is "the most concrete manifestation of using shamelessness as a criterion for (American) international policy."

The editorial pointed out that Eisenhower's statement once again proves that peace never depends on, nor can it depend on, the "good intentions" of the representatives of imperialism, but on the power of the people of all countries to force these people to accept peace. The editorial said, "One must not, as some commentators who have not deeply observed the essence of the issue have done, only pay attention to the 'peace' promises of the representatives of monopoly organizations."

The editorial emphasized that in order to win peace, one must first rely on the powerful mobilization of the majority of the world's people and the firm attitude of those great powers that sincerely demand peace.

British "Daily Worker" says
Eisenhower is brazen

The British "Daily Worker" published an editorial on the 27th pointing out that Eisenhower's speech was "the most outrageous speech ever delivered by a head of state."

The newspaper said: "The President shamelessly boasted about the U-2 aircraft flights. He not only generally defended these flights, but also said that this provocation carried out on the eve of the summit conference was correct."

The "Daily Worker" pointed out, "What a disgraceful attitude the U.S. President has taken! Defending military provocations, saying that it is justified to deceive on the issue of these provocations, abandoning lies only when the truth cannot be concealed, canceling these provocations only when their 'effectiveness' becomes a problem - this is a record of dishonesty, lack of principle, and hypocrisy, something that has not been seen since the era of Hitler."

    对美帝国主义决不能有任何幻想
    各国舆论指出艾森豪威尔的演说再次暴露了他的真面目
    本报综合报道　各国舆论纷纷抨击艾森豪威尔5月25日发表的演说，强烈谴责美帝国主义者的侵略罪行。
    捷“红色权利报”说
    美国的冒险政策没有改变
    捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”在一篇评论中说，美国总统艾森豪威尔的广播演说，首先证实了他对U—2型飞机挑衅事件的责任，证实了他对这一事件所表明的政策的全部内容的责任，表明他在继续奉行“实力地位”政策。评论指出，目前美国政府没有改变冒险政策的任何迹象。
    评论指出，艾森豪威尔坚持的“实力地位”政策是出自美国帝国主义者企图称霸世界的野心。因而华盛顿不准备用任何协定来“束缚”自己。
    评论接着说，美国能够在世界上称霸的时代，已随着1953年的朝鲜战争的失败而告终了。侵略性条约和军事基地体系的危机，在加剧着独裁制度的危机。
    保“农业旗帜报”说美帝国主义坚持实力政策
    保加利亚“农业旗帜报”的评论说：艾森豪威尔的演说又一次证明赫鲁晓夫在巴黎揭露挑衅分子的声明是正确的。艾森豪威尔的讲话表明，美帝国主义者并不愿意缓和国际紧张局势，他们阴谋破坏和平共处，继续在按照老办法和从过了时的“实力地位”出发行事。
    保加利亚“劳动报”发表评论说，艾森豪威尔的演说再一次暴露了他的真实面目。
    黎巴嫩“呼声报”说
  美帝国主义是和平的敌人
    黎巴嫩“呼声报”指出，“艾森豪威尔的演说是公开的战争叫嚣，给国际紧张局势火上加油”；“美国总统的演说再一次暴露了美帝国主义是缓和紧张局势、争取和平和保卫其他国家主权的最凶恶的敌人，是威胁各国人民的安全和独立的最大的危险”。
    这家报纸进一步指出，艾森豪威尔的演说毫无疑问地将使全世界人民对美帝国主义更加愤怒和警惕。
      古巴“今日报”说和平取决于各国人民的力量
    古巴“今日报”发表社论说，艾森豪威尔的这篇演说是“把厚颜无耻作为（美国）国际政策的准则来维护的最具体的表现”。
    社论指出，艾森豪威尔的声明又一次证明，和平决不取决于也不可能取决于帝国主义代表人物的“善良愿望”，而是取决于各国人民强迫这些人接受和平的力量。社论说，“不能像某些没有深入观察问题本质的评论家所做的那样，只注意垄断组织的代表的‘和平’诺言”。
    社论强调说，为了赢得和平，首先必须依靠世界上大多数人的有力动员和那些真诚地要求和平的大国的坚定态度。
    英国“工人日报”说
  艾森豪威尔厚颜无耻
    英国“工人日报”27日发表社论指出，艾森豪威尔的演说是“一个国家首脑曾经发表过的最不像话的演说”。
    这家报纸说：“这位总统以厚颜无耻的方式吹嘘U—2型飞机的飞行。他不仅一般地为这种飞行辩解，而且说在最高级会议前夕进行的这种挑衅是正确的。”
    “工人日报”指出，“美国总统采取了多么可耻的态度啊！为军事挑衅辩护，说在这种挑衅问题上进行欺骗是正当的，只是在瞒不住真相的时候才放弃谎言，只是由于挑衅的‘有效性’成了问题时才取消这种挑衅——这是不诚实、缺乏原则和虚伪的记录，这是希特勒时代以后所没有过的。”
