　　Daring to be the first means not being bound by convention, not sticking to the old ways, daring to walk roads that others have not walked, daring to climb peaks that others dare not climb. Currently, we are carrying out a great Marxist-Leninist economic and technological revolution movement in urban and rural areas. In this great mass movement, we need to greatly promote the communist style of daring to be the first.

　　To be the first, we must first have the communist ambition, break superstitions, liberate our minds, dare to take risks, and be fearless. Creating miracles is both difficult and not difficult. If people confine themselves, are timid, and always follow in the footsteps of others; if they dare not do what the ancients did not do; if they dare not do what foreigners have not done; if they dare not do what experts have not done; if they dare not do what is not written in books, then such people will inevitably find it extremely difficult to create miracles, as “difficult as ascending to heaven.” However, for revolutionaries who are determined to transform the old world and create a new world, creating miracles, although there are many difficulties, is by no means insurmountable. Because they have the great ideal of realizing communism, and a great ideal generates great power. This power can make people forge ahead, and all conventions and rules can be broken, and all miracles on earth can be created! Before liberation, Hefeng Textile Factory could only spin low-grade yarn for nearly half a century. Why can it now spin high-grade yarn when the equipment and raw materials have not changed? The reason is that under the leadership of the Party, people have changed, and people's thinking has changed!

    敢于首创
    首创就是不因循，不守旧，敢于走别人不曾走过的路，敢于攀别人不敢攀的高峰。目前，我们正在开展一个伟大的马克思列宁主义的城乡经济技术革命运动，在这个伟大的群众运动中，我们需要大大发扬敢于首创的共产主义风格。
    要首创，首先要有共产主义的雄心壮志，破除迷信，解放思想，敢冒风险，无所畏惧。创造奇迹，既难又不难。如果人们作茧自缚，畏首畏尾，老是踏着别人的脚印走路，古人没有做的，不敢做；外国人没有做的，不敢做；专家没有做的，不敢做；书上没有写的，不敢做。这样的人，对于创奇迹，必然感到千难万难，“难于上青天”。但是对于立志改造旧世界、创立新世界的革命者来说，创造奇迹，虽有千难万难，也决不是不可战胜的。因为他们有着实现共产主义的伟大理想，伟大的理想产生伟大的力量。这种力量可以使人勇往直前，一切陈规戒律都能冲破，一切人间奇迹都能创造！和丰纱厂解放前近半个世纪只能纺低级纱，为什么现在设备未变原料未变却能纺出高级纱呢？其原因就是：在党的领导下，人变了，人的思想变了！
