    On Combining Mining and Agriculture
    Yu Yang

    The Datong Mining Bureau's Meiyukou Mine in Shanxi Province has organized underground workers to rotate in participating in agricultural production labor, implementing a combination of mining and agriculture. This is a good way to improve workers' health and strengthen worker-peasant ties.

    Coal mine production, except for open-pit mines, mostly involves underground operations. Miners rarely see sunlight year after year, inevitably leading to occupational health effects to some degree. Implementing rotation to participate in agricultural production transforms year-round underground labor into intermittent underground labor. This undoubtedly greatly helps the health of miners. The most vivid proof is that eighteen miners at the Meiyukou Mine suffering from arthritis quickly recovered their health after a period of agricultural labor.

    Caring for workers' health and paying attention to the combination of work and rest are major issues in ensuring sustained leaps forward. We see that comrades who enjoy running or playing basketball have this experience: after a strenuous exercise, they need a good rest. The method of rest is also very important. If you lie down to rest immediately, not only will it take longer to recover from fatigue, but it will also result in aches all over. If you switch to a slow jog, doing some light activities, you will feel that you recover from fatigue quickly, and your body will feel very comfortable. The outstanding benefit of implementing the combination of mining and agriculture in coal enterprises lies in achieving the effect of active rest, ensuring that underground workers maintain a healthy physique and abundant energy for daily production and learning.

    There has always been a natural connection between workers and peasants in our country. Although some workers participate in factory production, their old homes are still in the countryside, or their brothers and parents are still engaged in agricultural production. Although some peasants are mainly engaged in agricultural production, they also temporarily participate in industrial labor when agricultural production is relatively idle. Therefore, in a certain period, in enterprises similar to coal mine production, adopting a rotation method to participate in agricultural production, while drawing some people from the countryside to work in factories, can both strengthen worker-peasant relations and reduce the differences between workers and peasants. Because workers going to the countryside can help agriculture with technological transformation, transforming the countryside with the face of the working class; peasants going to factories and mines can learn from the worker elder brothers, and train themselves to reach the level of workers in terms of political thought, culture, and technology, so that workers or peasants can gradually become both workers and peasants.

    Now, the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China wants to universally promote the experience of the Meiyukou Mine in the province's coal mines, chemical systems, and mechanical forging and other production departments with high labor intensity or poor labor conditions. This is a very correct approach. The combination of mining and agriculture is a good method, a good direction, and it will be even better to promote it more widely.

    谈矿农结合

    山西大同矿务局煤峪口矿组织井下工人轮换参加农业生产劳动，实行矿农结合，这是增进工人健康，加强工农联系的一个好办法。
    煤矿生产除了露天矿以外，大部分是井下作业，矿工们成年累月很少见到阳光，对健康总不免带来或多或少职业性的影响。实行轮换参加农业生产，这就把成年累月的地下劳动变成了间歇性的地下劳动。对矿工的健康无疑是有很大帮助的。煤峪口矿十八名患关节炎的矿工经过一段时间农业劳动，很快恢复了健康，就是最生动的证明。
    关心工人健康，注意劳逸结合，是保证持续跃进的重大问题。我们看到，喜欢跑步或打篮球的同志都有这种经验，一场剧烈运动之后，就要好好休息。休息的方法也大有讲究。如果立刻躺下来休息，不但恢复疲劳慢，而且会弄得一身疼痛。要是改为缓缓的小跑，作些轻微活动，会感到恢复疲劳很快，周身也很舒适。煤炭企业实行矿农结合的突出好处，在于收到了积极休息的效果，保证井下工人经常地保持健康的体质和充沛的精力从事日常生产和学习。
    我国工人和农民之间从来就有着天然的联系。有些工人虽然参加了工厂生产，他的老家却仍然在农村，或者他的兄弟和父母仍在从事农业生产。有些农民虽然主要从事农业生产，但在农村生产较闲的时候，也有临时参加工业劳动的。因此，在一定时期，在类似煤矿生产的企业里，采用轮换的办法参加农业生产，同时从农村抽换一些人到工厂工作。这就既可以密切工农关系，又可以缩小工农差别。因为工人到农村可以帮助农业进行技术改造，以工人阶级的面貌改造农村；农民到工矿可以向工人老大哥学习，锻炼自己在政治思想和文化技术等方面达到工人的水平，使工人或农民都可以逐步做到亦工亦农。
    现在，中共山西省委要在全省煤矿、化工系统和机械锻造等劳动强度高或劳动条件不太好的生产部门中普遍推行煤峪口矿的经验，这是很正确的做法。矿农结合，办法好，方向好，推而广之则更好。
