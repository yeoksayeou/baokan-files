Amidst Ice Peaks and Snow Pagodas

    At the foot of the mountain, beside rocks, in river valleys, and between peaks and ridges, stand towering forests of ice peaks and snow pagodas. Some resemble sharp pagodas, piercing the sky; some resemble swaying ancient trees, extending their branches; some resemble majestic palaces, distributed with neat pavilions and gates; some resemble turbulent waterfalls, cascading thousands of feet. But they are all as transparent as crystal, as white as silver, as shimmering as waves, and as colorful as jewels.

    This is the extraordinary ice and snow world of Mount Everest, formed over long ages.

    Here, you won't see the active Himalayan blue sheep herds running, nor will you hear the calls of the soaring skylarks. There are no trees, and even moss and wild grass clinging to the cracks in the rocks cannot be found. In the narrow valleys stretching for dozens of miles, you see nothing but vast ice and snow and unbearable cold.

    Today, Chinese mountaineers are supporting silver-gray tents on the ice slopes here, establishing neat tent "villages." Between two ice pillars, a bright red silk is tied to two tent poles, forming the arch of the tent village. Conspicuous slogans are pasted on huge rocks: "Welcome, mountaineering heroes!"

    Before the mountaineers even began their high-altitude acclimatization marches, the logistics staff at base camp worked tirelessly to establish many tent camps among the mountains and ridges of Mount Everest, stocking them with ample food and fuel, creating a comfortable resting environment for the mountaineers.

    The mountaineers gratefully called the camps "high-altitude hotels."

    Whenever the mountaineers trudged through snow and ice, completing a day's journey, people could light gasoline stoves in their tents and collect specially made dried rice, Chengdu egg noodles, Inner Mongolian condensed milk, Lhasa beef and mutton, Beijing eggs and pickles, and various canned foods and fruits from all over the country from the "warehouse." According to their preferences, they could make delicious Southern rice and Northern dumplings.

    Each high-altitude camp is equipped with dedicated management personnel. The mountaineers affectionately call them "managers."

    At the camp located at 5,900 meters above sea level, the "manager" is a vibrant young man, Ji Kecheng, a fourth-year student at Beijing Institute of Geology. With a love for the motherland's mountains and rivers, Ji Kecheng has accompanied mountaineers to many mountain ranges over the years, searching for treasures for the country. Now, he has "settled down" in Mount Everest, both serving the mountaineers and taking advantage of his free time to climb rocks and explore the secrets of this mountain peak.

    Now, Ji Kecheng's mountaineering backpack is filled with various rock and mineral specimens from the slopes of Mount Everest; his notebook beside his pillow records his observations and explorations of Mount Everest.

    Whether it is a clear morning or a snowy night, Ji Kecheng must live in this deep mountain's low tent, listening to the cracking of glaciers and the roaring of wind and snow. However, Ji Kecheng does not feel lonely or isolated. Although this valley is extraordinarily desolate, he is closely connected with the people of the motherland in a common cause.
      
      The Red First-Aid Kit

    On the boulder-strewn cliffs, in the boundless snowfields, in the perilous icefall zones, and beside the deep ice cracks, wherever the mountaineers go, the young doctor Wu Yongsheng follows with his red first-aid kit on his back.

    Wu Yongsheng is a teacher at a medical university in our country. His health is not very good, but to ensure the health of the mountaineers, for two years, he has carried the medicine bag, held his ice axe, and traveled with the mountaineers in the high mountain areas of the motherland. On each march, Wu Yongsheng would sometimes walk at the front of the team and sometimes stay at the back. While wiping the sweat from his face, he would gasp and treat the team members for their illnesses. Others asked him, "Tired, Lao Wu!" He always smiled modestly and said, "It's nothing! It's nothing!"

    When the team rested at the camp, while others were drinking tea and eating, Wu Yongsheng would carry his medicine bag out of one tent and into another. He would ask the team members about their reactions at high altitude, examine their internal organs, and measure their temperature and pulse one by one. Others asked him, "Hungry, Lao Wu!" He still smiled and said, "It's nothing!"

    Once, Wu Yongsheng followed the mountaineers to the top of the North Col ice slope, more than 7,000 meters above sea level, and encountered a rare blizzard. Due to prolonged high-altitude marching without adequate rest, Wu Yongsheng felt a severe headache and nausea. However, he still carried his medicine bag, stepped on the rope ladder, and climbed to the top of the 60-70 degree ice slope. The rope ladder swayed in the air, his eyes were blurred, his legs were weak and trembling, and his arms were numb and painful. Several times, he really wanted to stop, even if it was just to lie down on the ice slope. But when he saw the mountaineers advancing ahead of him against the wind and snow, he thought: I am a doctor, I must protect the health of my comrades, how can I abandon them? No! I must go up, go up! He finally reached the North Col with the mountaineers.

    Wu Yongsheng not only treats the mountaineers but also earnestly conducts high-altitude physiological and medical research, preparing to compile a relatively complete set of high-altitude physiological and medical experiences for the country's medical community. This hardworking and enduring young doctor is loved by all the mountaineers. No matter how steep the ice mountain or how bad the weather, as long as this red first-aid kit appears in the mountaineering team, people feel safe and strong.

        The Light of the Party

    This is the high-altitude camp at 7,600 meters above sea level on the north slope of Mount Everest.

    The night is deep, and the wind and snow are howling.

    The strong southwest wind swirls on the snow-covered slopes, and ice chips and granular snow swirl in the air like a rainstorm.

    The mountaineers arrived at this camp in the evening after more than ten hours of marching during the day. Extreme fatigue caused them to crawl into their tents and sleep long ago.

    However, the lights are bright in a high-altitude tent in the middle of the camp. The mountaineering team's Party Committee is holding a meeting.

    The meeting is chaired by Party Committee Secretary Shi Zhanchun, and sitting in the corners of the tent are Deputy Party Committee Secretary Wang Fengtong, Party Committee member Xu Jing, and other mountaineers who have been invited to attend.

    The central agenda of the meeting is to discuss and approve the transfer of mountaineer Zhang Junyan from probationary member to full member of the Party.

    Zhang Junyan is the transportation captain of the mountaineering team. In terms of his physical strength and high-altitude adaptation ability, he is fully capable of reaching the summit of Mount Everest. However, due to work needs, the Party Committee decided that he would lead the transportation team to deliver supplies to the main team members, undertaking a very important but unsung task. For two months, Zhang Junyan has led the transportation team through ice and snow, braving the bitter cold of minus 30 to 40 degrees Celsius, climbing among the mountains and ridges of Mount Everest. Headaches and other high-altitude reactions cannot stop Zhang Junyan from moving forward; he still walks at the forefront of the team. After several arduous marches, Zhang Junyan and the transportation team successfully transported all the high-altitude materials needed for the main peak assault to the designated high-altitude camp within the scheduled time, ensuring that the mountaineering team's battle to capture the main peak could be carried out victoriously.

    Today, Zhang Junyan's probationary period is just over, and the Party Committee decided to take time out of the tense and difficult march to discuss and approve his transfer to full membership of the Party, as a commendation for Comrade Zhang Junyan's exemplary behavior.

    Now, Zhang Junyan—this tall young man—is sitting in the middle of the tent, solemnly reporting to the Party organization on his thoughts and performance during the probationary period, and requesting the Party organization to review him.

    The sound of the wind in the night sky outside the tent is deafening, but inside the tent, Zhang Junyan's voice is excited, solemn, and loud.

    The people attending the meeting listened to Zhang Junyan's report and nodded repeatedly with satisfaction.

    Finally, after a vote, the Chinese Mountaineering Team Party Committee formally passed a resolution approving the timely transfer of Comrade Zhang Junyan from probationary member to full member of the Party. People shook hands with Zhang Junyan one by one, congratulating him. Zhang Junyan said excitedly: "I will definitely live up to the expectations of the Party, continue to work hard, dedicate my youth to the motherland's magnificent mountaineering cause, and plant the red flag all over the mountains of the motherland."

    The Party Committee meeting ended successfully. Another day dawns. The wind and snow are even more violent, and the roaring sound covers the hazy earth. However, under the Party's kind teachings and encouragement, the mountaineers are all preparing to set off in high spirits.

    珠穆朗玛山中的日日夜夜
    郭超人
    冰峰雪塔间
    山脚下，岩石旁，河谷里，峰岭间，到处是高耸的森林般的冰峰雪塔。有些像尖削的宝塔，高插天空；有些像婆娑的古树，伸展着枝桠；有些像巍峨的宫殿，分布着整齐的亭台门户；有些像汹猛的瀑布，一泻万丈。但它们都像水晶一样透明，像银子一样洁白，像波涛一样闪耀光辉，像宝石一样绚丽多彩。
    这是在漫长的年代形成的珠穆朗玛峰奇异的冰雪世界。
    在这里，你看不到那活跃奔跑的喜马拉雅野羊群，也听不到那高翔的云雀的鸣叫。没有树木，甚至连那紧贴在石缝里的藓苔和野草也找不到。长达数十里的狭谷里，除了茫茫的冰雪和令人难忍的严寒，看不到别的东西。
    今天，中国的登山运动员们就在这里的冰坡上，支撑起一座座银灰色的帐篷，建立了整整齐齐的帐篷“村落”。在两座冰柱中间，两根帐篷杆上系着鲜艳的红绸，构成了帐篷村落的彩门。巨大的岩石上，贴着醒目的标语：“欢迎你们，登山英雄们！”
    在登山运动员还没有开始进行高山适应性行军以前，大本营的后勤工作人员就不辞劳苦，在珠穆朗玛峰的丛山峻岭间，建立了许多座帐篷营地，储备着充足的食品和燃料，为登山运动员们创造了舒适的休息环境。
    登山运动员们感激地把营地称作“高山饭店”。
    每当登山队员们踏雪蹬冰，走完了一天的行程以后，人们就可以在帐篷里点起汽油火炉，从“仓库”里领到特制的干燥饭，成都的鸡蛋挂面，内蒙古的炼乳，拉萨的牛羊肉，北京的鸡蛋和酱菜，全国各地出产的各种食品罐头和水果罐头，凭各人的喜爱，做出美味的南方米饭和北方的水饺。
    在每座高山营地上，都设有专门的管理人员。登山队员们亲热地把他们叫作“经理”。
    在拔海五千九百米的营地上，担任“经理”的是一个朝气勃勃的青年人、北京地质学院四年级学生纪克诚。怀着对祖国山河的热爱，几年来，纪克诚同登山队员们一起到过许多座山岭，为国家找宝藏。现在，他又在珠穆朗玛山中“安家落户”，一方面为登山队员们服务，一方面利用空闲时间攀岩走壁，探测这座山峰的秘密。
    现在，在纪克诚的登山背包里，装满了珠穆朗玛山坡上多种多样的岩石和矿产标本；在他枕头边的笔记本上，记下了他对珠穆朗玛峰观测和考察的结果。
    无论是在晴朗的清晨，还是在风雪的深夜，纪克诚都要住在这深山的低矮帐篷里，听冰川的暴裂和风雪的咆哮。但是，纪克诚并不感到孤单，也不寂寞，虽然这山谷里异样的荒凉，但他正紧紧地与祖国人民生活在一个共同的事业里。
      红色救急包
    在滚石垒垒的峭壁上，在四顾无边的雪地里，在险陡的冰崩地带，在深邃的冰裂缝旁边，无论登山队员们走到哪里，青年医生吴永生就背着红色救急包跟到哪里。
    吴永生是我国一所医科大学里的教师，他的身体并不很好，但为了保证登山队员们的健康，两年来，他背着药包，扶着冰镐，与登山运动员们一道，出入在祖国高山地带。在每次行军途中，吴永生一会儿走到队伍的前列，一会儿又留在队伍的后边。他一面抹掉满脸的汗水，一面喘着气为队员们治病。别人问他：“累吗？老吴！”他总是谦和地笑着说：“没啥！没啥！”
    当队伍在营地休息下来，别人在喝茶吃饭的时候，吴永生却背着药包从这个帐篷出来，又走到那个帐篷里去。他挨个儿询问队员们在高山上的反应，为他们检查内脏、测量体温和脉搏。别人问他：“饿吗？老吴！”他仍然笑着说：“没啥！”
    有一次，吴永生跟随登山运动员们出发到拔海七千米以上的北坳冰坡顶部去，正遇着一场少有的大风雪。由于长时间的高山行军得不到很好的休息，吴永生感到剧烈的头疼和恶心，但是，他仍背着药包，踩着绳梯，往六、七十度的冰坡顶端攀去。绳梯在空中摇晃着，他的眼前朦胧一片，他的双腿软弱而颤抖，他的双臂麻木而疼痛。有好几次，他真想停下来，哪怕就在冰坡上躺一躺也好啊。但当他望见登山队员们正在他前面顶着风雪前进时，他想：我是医生，我要保护同志们的健康，我怎么能抛开他们不管？不！一定要上去，上去！他终于与登山队员们一道到达北坳。
    吴永生不仅为登山队员们治病，同时还认真地进行着高山生理和医疗的调查研究工作，准备为祖国医学界整理出一套比较完整的高山生理和医疗的经验。这个刻苦耐劳的青年医生，受到了全体登山队员们的爱戴。不管冰山多么险陡，也不管天气多么恶劣，只要这个红色的救急包出现在登山队员的行列中，人们就感到安全和力量。
        党的光芒
    这是在珠穆朗玛峰北坡拔海七千六百米的高山营地上。
    夜色深沉，风雪呼啸。
    强劲的西南风在积雪皑皑的小坡上旋转着，冰渣和粒雪像暴雨一样在空中翻荡。
    登山队员们经过白天十几个小时的行军，傍晚来到了这座营地，极度的疲劳使他们早就钻进了帐篷安睡了。
    但是，在营地中间的一座高山帐篷里却灯光明亮。登山队党委会正在举行会议。
    会议由党委书记史占春主持，坐在帐篷两角的还有党委副书记王凤桐，党委委员许竞和其他应邀参加的登山队员。
    会议的中心议题是讨论和批准登山队员张俊岩同志由预备党员转为正式党员。
    张俊岩是登山队的运输队长，就他的体力和高山适应的能力看，他完全可登上珠穆朗玛顶峰。但由于工作需要，党委会决定他带领运输队员为主力队员运送物资，担负起十分重要但却是默默无闻的任务。两个月来，张俊岩领导运输队员卧冰饮雪，冒着摄氏零下三、四十度的严寒，攀登在珠穆朗玛峰的丛山峻岭间。头痛等高山反应不能阻止张俊岩前进的脚步，他仍然走在队伍的最前列。经过几次艰苦的行军，张俊岩和运输队员们一道，在预定的时间里，把突击主峰需用的全部高山物资胜利地运送到预定的高山营地，保证了登山队夺取主峰的战斗能够胜利地进行。
    今天，刚好张俊岩同志的预备期满，党委会决定就在紧张而艰难的行军途中，挤出时间讨论和批准他转为正式党员，作为对张俊岩同志模范行为的表彰。
    现在，张俊岩——这个身材高大的青年人，坐在帐篷正中严肃地向党组织汇报他在预备期中的思想和表现，请求党组织对他进行审查。
    帐篷外的夜空中风声震耳，但帐篷内张俊岩的声音激动、庄严而宏亮。
    参加会议的人们一边听着张俊岩的汇报，一边满意地连连点头。
    最后，经过表决，中国登山队党委会正式通过了一项决议，批准张俊岩同志由预备党员按期转为正式党员。人们同张俊岩一一握手，向他表示祝贺。张俊岩激动地说：“我一定不辜负党的期望，继续努力，把自己的青春献给祖国壮丽的登山事业，把红旗插遍祖国的群峰。”
    党委会圆满地结束了。又是一天的黎明。风雪更加狂暴，吼啸声遮盖着朦胧的大地。但是，在党的亲切教导和鼓舞下，登山队员们却一个个精神抖擞地准备整装出发了。
