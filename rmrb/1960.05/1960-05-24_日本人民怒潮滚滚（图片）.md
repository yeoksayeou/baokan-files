Dear readers, what you see in these photos are some snapshots of the Japanese people's struggle against U.S. imperialism and its running dog, the Kishi Nobusuke clique. The Japanese people's massive and vigorous struggle against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries is like a rolling tide of anger, surging forward. Millions upon millions of Japanese people have taken to the streets, surrounding the Diet, petitioning and demonstrating, with songs and slogans shaking the heavens and the earth, demonstrating the invincible and immense power of the masses.

Touching scenes appear before the readers' eyes: workers, farmers, students, women, and children are all participating in the struggle. This is a scene of a people's struggle like a storm. The shouts against U.S. imperialism and against the Kishi Nobusuke traitorous government resound throughout Japan. No matter how ferocious U.S. imperialism is, no matter how despicable and shameless the Kishi Nobusuke clique is, they will ultimately be battered and bloodied in the face of the people's struggle! Their lifespan will not be long!

In the demonstration procession appeared a woman whose husband was a victim of World War II. She said: "I oppose the new Security Treaty. I do not want my children to die in a new war of aggression."

On May 15, the Japanese Communist Party held a demonstration rally in Hibiya Park, Tokyo, against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and in support of the South Korean people.

On May 12, three thousand workers and citizens came from western and northern Tokyo to submit their petitions against the "Security Treaty" to the Diet.

Chairman of the Socialist Party Inejiro Asanuma (second from the left) and other Socialist Party members of parliament receive petitions against the "Security Treaty" brought by representatives from various regions in the Diet.

On April 22, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party used violence in an attempt to force Communist and Socialist Party members to end their interpellation of the "Security Treaty." In the center of the picture is Ozawa, the chairman of the ruling party's Special Committee on the Security Treaty in the House of Representatives, protected by the police. Students bravely rushed into the ranks of the police to rescue a woman who had been beaten.

    日本人民怒潮滚滚
    亲爱的读者们，你们从这些照片里看到的，是日本人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗岸信介集团斗争的一些缩影。日本人民反对美日反动派的规模宏大的、轰轰烈烈的斗争，像滚滚的怒潮，汹涌澎湃。千千万万的日本人民走上街头，包围国会，请愿示威，歌声、口号声震天动地，表现了人民群众不可侮的无比强大的力量。
    一个个感人的镜头出现在读者的面前：工人、农民、学生、妇女、儿童都参加了斗争，这是一个狂风暴雨般的人民斗争的场面。反对美帝国主义，打倒岸信介卖国政府的吼声响遍了日本。不管美帝国主义怎样凶恶，不管岸信介集团怎样卑鄙无耻，终将在人民斗争的面前碰得头破血流！他们的寿命是不会很长了！
    示威队伍里出现一个妇女，她的丈夫是第二次世界大战中的牺牲者。她说：“我反对新安全条约。我不愿让我的孩子们在新的侵略战争中丧生。”
    5月15日，日本共产党在东京日比谷公园举行了反对日美军事同盟条约支持南朝鲜人民的示威大会。
    5月12日，从东京西、北部来了三千名工人和市民，向国会递交他们反对“安全条约”的请愿书。
    社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎（左起第二人）和其他社会党议员，在国会里接受各地代表带来的反对“安全条约”的请愿书。
    4月22日，执政的自由民主党曾经使用暴力，企图迫使共产党和社会党的议员结束对“安全条约”的质询。图中正中的是警察保护下的众议院安全条约特别小组委员会执政党委员长小泽。学生们勇敢地冲进警察的行列里，抢救出一个被殴伤了的妇女。
