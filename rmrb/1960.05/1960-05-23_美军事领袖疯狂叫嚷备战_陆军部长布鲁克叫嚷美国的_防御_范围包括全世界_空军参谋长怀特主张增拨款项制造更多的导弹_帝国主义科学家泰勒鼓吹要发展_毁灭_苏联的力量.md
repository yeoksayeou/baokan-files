Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 21st: Following U.S. President Eisenhower's blatant sabotage of the Four-Power Summit, U.S. military leaders and politicians have been making warmongering pronouncements for days, taking the opportunity to advocate for accelerated arms expansion and war preparations.

U.S. Secretary of the Army Brucker, at a banquet on the "Day of Celebrating U.S. Armed Forces" on the 20th, clamored that "the Paris events that shook the free world (referring to the U.S. sabotaging the summit) in the strongest possible way emphasized the extreme importance of our powerful Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force." He emphasized that it was "absolutely necessary" for the U.S. to concentrate its best scientists and engineers to develop "ultra-modern weapons," and said that he believed the U.S. must "strengthen its armed forces, and Congress must allocate sufficient funds to do so." Prior to this, Brucker had delivered warmongering speeches in Detroit and Cleveland on the 17th, clamoring that the U.S. "must strengthen its defense" to deal with the Soviet Union and China. He also blatantly revealed the U.S.'s ambition to occupy Okinawa, saying that "our (U.S.) defense range no longer stops at our own national borders, but extends from one pole to the other, including the entire world." In another speech, Brucker also revealed that the U.S. would increase troop deployments to South Korea to "strengthen the two U.S. Army divisions in (South) Korea."

U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff White, on the 19th, using the excuse that the failure of the summit had caused "a change in the situation," clamored that the U.S. must increase military spending and strengthen its "deterrent force." He requested that the Senate Appropriations Committee increase appropriations by $360 million to manufacture "more missiles" in order to build two more "Atlas" intercontinental ballistic missile battalions by 1963. White also requested an additional $285 million to resume the production of "B-70" bombers.

U.S. Strategic Air Command Commander Power, in a speech to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on the 19th, clamored that the U.S. "is both determined and prepared to fight."

U.S. Air Force Secretary Sharp, who is in the Far East urging U.S. vassal states to step up war preparations, openly threatened in Manila on the 17th that the U.S. and its "allies" in the Far East have their air forces "ready to go," and said that this "mixed force," which is "constantly on alert," is a "formidable deterrent" against the "Communists." Sharp also revealed that the Chiang Kai-shek clique's air force would be armed with new jet fighters, and threatened to supply the Philippines with "Sidewinder" missiles, plotting to intensify the tense situation in the Far East.

U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Twining, testifying before the U.S. Senate on the 18th, boasted that the world-scale war preparation exercises ordered by U.S. Secretary of Defense Gates a few hours before the scheduled opening of the summit, in order to sabotage the conference, were very successful. He said that after the summit collapsed, West Berlin "is the primary military problem," and said in a threatening tone: "Our (U.S.) troops are in good, prepared condition and ready to move." U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense Douglas, who testified in the Senate with Twining for military appropriations, requested increased appropriations in the military budget for "Bomarc-B" missiles and super aircraft carriers.

Imperialist scientist Teller, hailed as the "father of the hydrogen bomb" by the U.S., took advantage of the U.S.'s sabotage of the summit at a gathering on the 21st to solicit business for monopoly capitalists, clamoring that the U.S. must spare no expense, spending "tens of billions of dollars," to develop space weapons and nuclear weapons in order to possess the power to "destroy" the Soviet Union. Teller brazenly advocated that the U.S. immediately resume nuclear weapons testing. He said that resuming nuclear testing "is absolutely necessary for the U.S. to continue to develop nuclear weapons, especially small nuclear weapons."

Notorious U.S. Senator Bridges openly demanded in a robber-like tone that the U.S. government not only not stop U.S. aircraft from carrying out aggressive flights over the Soviet Union, but on the contrary, greatly expand the scale of such flights. Senator Goldwater also demanded in the U.S. Congress that the production of "B-70" bombers be resumed in order to use them to carry out "a revolution in the entire reconnaissance range." Goldwater wanted his "cold war" partners to believe that this bomber "can observe any part of the earth at will."

In the midst of the warmongering clamor stirred up by the U.S. ruling clique, the U.S. House Appropriations Committee passed a $73 million increase on the 20th to develop nuclear military aircraft. According to reports, the U.S. has spent more than $1 billion to research this type of aircraft, and will spend billions more in the next five to eight years. The members of the Appropriations Committee openly used the failure of the summit as an excuse to increase this military expenditure. Under these circumstances, the prices of U.S. arms industry stocks have soared sharply in recent days. The stocks of aircraft, electronics, missiles, and rocket fuel industries have risen particularly sharply. The day after the summit was sabotaged by the U.S. - the 18th - the trading volume on the U.S. stock market broke the highest record since October 1958. U.S. warmongers are taking the opportunity to make a fortune.

    空军参谋长怀特主张增拨款项制造更多的导弹
    帝国主义科学家泰勒鼓吹要发展“毁灭”苏联的力量
    新华社21日讯　华盛顿消息：在美国总统艾森豪威尔公然破坏四国首脑会议后，美国军事首领和政客连日来大发好战叫嚣，趁机鼓吹加紧扩军备战。
    美国陆军部长布鲁克20日在“庆祝美国武装部队日”的宴会上叫嚷说，“震动了自由世界的巴黎事件（指美国破坏首脑会议）以最强有力的方式着重指出我们强大的陆军、海军、海军陆战队和空军的极端重要性”。他强调美国“十分必要”集中最好的科学家和工程师去发展“超现代化的武器”，并说他认为美国必须“加强它的武装部队，而且国会必须拨给足够的经费以做到这一点。”在这以前布鲁克17日曾在底特律和克利夫兰发表好战的演说，叫嚣美国“必须加强它的国防”来对付苏联和中国。他还露骨地表明美国霸占琉球的野心说，“我们（美国）的防御范围已不再止于我们自己国家的边疆，而是从这一极地延伸到另一极地，包括了整个世界。”布鲁克在另一次讲话中还透露美国要增派军队到南朝鲜以“加强美国在（南）朝鲜的两个陆军师”。
    美国空军参谋长怀特19日借口首脑会议未能举行使“情况发生了变化”，叫嚷美国必须增加军费，加强“威慑力量”。他要求参议院拨款委员会增拨三亿六千万美元来制造“更多的导弹”，以便在1963年前增建两个“阿特拉斯”式洲际导弹营。怀特还要求再拨出二亿八千五百万美元，恢复制造“B—70”型轰炸机的工作。
    美国战略空军司令鲍威尔19日在向美国商会发表的演说中叫嚷美国“既有决心而且也准备作战”。
    正在远东督促美国的仆从国加紧备战活动的美国空军部长夏普17日在马尼拉公然威胁说，美国和它的“盟国”在远东的空军已经“准备就绪”，并说这支“一直处于戒备状态”的“混合部队是对付共产党”的
  “可畏的威慑力量”。夏普还透露以新式喷气战斗机武装蒋介石集团空军，并扬言准备把“响尾蛇”式导弹供给菲律宾，阴谋加剧远东紧张局势。
    美国参谋长联席会议主席特文宁18日在美国参议院作证时吹嘘美国国防部长盖茨在首脑会议预定开幕时间前几小时为了破坏会议而下令举行的世界规模的备战演习十分成功。他说，首脑会议垮台后，西柏林“是首要的军事问题”，并且以威胁的口吻说：“我们（美国）的部队正在良好的、作好准备的情况下，而且准备出动。”同特文宁一起在参议院为军事拨款作证的美国副国防部长道格拉斯要求在军事预算中增加“鲍马克—B”式导弹和超级航空母舰的拨款。
    被美国捧为“氢弹之父”的帝国主义科学家泰勒21日在一次集会中借美国破坏首脑会议的机会为垄断资本家拉生意，他鼓吹美国必须不惜花费“成几十亿的美元”来发展空间武器和核武器以便拥有“毁灭”苏联的力量。泰勒悍然主张美国立刻恢复核武器试验。他说，恢复核试验“对于美国继续发展核武器特别是小型核武器是十分必要的”。
    臭名昭彰的美国参议员布里奇斯以强盗的口吻公开要求美国政府不仅不要停止美国飞机在苏联上空的侵略飞行，相反地要大大扩大这种飞行的规模。参议员戈德华特也在美国国会中要求恢复制造“B—70型”轰炸机，以便利用它在“整个侦察范围内实行革命”。戈德华特要他的“冷战”伙伴相信：这种轰炸机“能够为所欲为地观察地球的任何一部分”。
    在美国统治集团煽起的一片好战叫嚣中，美国众议院拨款委员会20日通过增拨七千三百万美元来发展核军用飞机。据报道，为了研究这种飞机，美国已花了十亿以上美元，在今后五年到八年还要花成十亿的美元。拨款委员会的委员们公然以首脑会议未能举行作为他们增加这笔军费的借口。在这种情况下，美国军火工业股票的价格连日猛烈上涨。飞机、电子、导弹和火箭燃料工业的股票上涨得特别多。首脑会议被美国破坏后的第二天——18日，美国股票市场的交易额打破了1958年10月以来的最高纪录。美国战争贩子正在趁机大发横财。
