Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 15th: Four hundred thousand people from all walks of life in Changsha, the capital of Hunan Province, held a rally and demonstration this morning in the rain to oppose the U.S.-Japan reactionaries' conspiracy to plot a new war and resolutely support the Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.

The people of Changsha will never forget the towering crimes of Japanese militarism during its invasion of China. During the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, Japanese militarists carried out cruel burning, killing, rape, and looting against the people of Hunan. Changsha was bombed more than 100 times, and more than 500,000 people were killed or maimed in Changsha, Hengyang, and more than 20 other cities and counties. Today, the U.S.-Japan reactionaries are plotting a new war of aggression, which has aroused great anger and resolute opposition from the people of the entire city and province.

At 8 a.m., people carrying banners and shouting slogans flocked to various gathering places. Eighty thousand people gathered at the People's Hall. Those attending the meeting included Cheng Qian, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Commission, and Governor of Hunan Province; Tan Yuobao, Secretary of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China; Yan Fusheng, Political Commissar of the Hunan Military Region; other leaders of the provincial and municipal Party and government; heads of various people's organizations and democratic parties; and workers, residents, peasants, officers and soldiers of the armed forces, militiamen, and students. Soviet and Czechoslovak experts and Vietnamese interns working in Hunan also attended the meeting.

Tan Yuobao, Secretary of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke first at the meeting. He said: "The Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality has strengthened the unity of the Japanese people, isolated the Nobusuke Kishi reactionary clique, exposed the crimes of U.S. imperialism in reviving Japanese militarism and plotting a new war, and made an important contribution to defending peace in Asia and the world. The 37 million people of Hunan, together with the people of the whole country and the whole world, express our firm support and heartfelt respect for the Japanese people's indomitable and heroic struggle.

Tan Yuobao said: The people of China and Japan must unite closely to wage a resolute struggle against the U.S.-Japan reactionaries. His speech was constantly interrupted by angry slogans from the crowd.

Subsequently, the heads of various people's organizations and local organizations of democratic parties, as well as representatives of workers, peasants, members of urban people's communes, and students, spoke at the meeting.

The meeting adopted a telegram from all walks of life in Hunan Province supporting the Japanese people's opposition to the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. Afterwards, the masses held a powerful demonstration and march in three routes.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 15th: Two hundred and fifty thousand people from all walks of life in Henan Province and Zhengzhou City held rallies and demonstrations in six locations this morning to resolutely support the Japanese people's just struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.

The central venue of the meeting was located in the Henan Provincial Stadium. Shi Xiangheng, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Wang Lizhi, First Secretary of the Zhengzhou Municipal Committee, and other provincial and municipal party and government leaders, as well as leaders from all walks of life in the province and city, attended the meeting. Experts from the German Democratic Republic in Zhengzhou and Vietnamese students in Henan also participated in the meeting.

The angry crowd shouted slogans such as "Oppose the revival of Japanese militarism" and "Down with U.S. imperialism," and gathered from factories, schools, government offices, and suburban people's communes to various venues early in the morning, carrying huge banners and cartoon posters. Tens of thousands of fully armed militiamen formed a well-organized and powerful contingent at the six venues. The location of the first urban people's commune in Henan Province—the Red Flag People's Commune—was one of the areas in Zhengzhou that suffered the most serious harm from Japanese fascism during the War of Resistance Against Japan. Today, a female commune member surnamed Ma from this commune recounted how, when she was about to give birth, Japanese fascist bandits killed her husband in front of her, causing her to lose sight in one eye and become half-insane. Today, she denounced the towering crimes committed by Japanese fascist bandits in China and expressed her firm support for the Japanese people's just struggle.

Shi Xiangheng, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke at the meeting. He pointed out that the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty is a thoroughly aggressive treaty that seriously threatens the security of the people of China, the Soviet Union, Korea, Vietnam, and other Asian countries, and will inevitably bring serious disasters to the Japanese people. He said that now, the anti-imperialist storm is surging and surging among the oppressed people of the world, which is powerfully impacting the reactionary rule of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs.

Those who spoke at the meeting also included the heads of various people's organizations and local organizations of democratic parties in Henan Province, as well as representatives from cultural and educational circles, industrial and commercial circles, workers, peasants, and students.

The meeting finally adopted a telegram from all walks of life in Henan Province and Zhengzhou City supporting the Japanese people's opposition to the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.

    据新华社长沙15日电　湖南省省会长沙市各界人民四十万人，今天上午冒雨举行集会和游行示威，反对美日反动派策划新战争的阴谋，坚决支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争。
    长沙市人民对日本军国主义侵略中国期间的滔天罪行永远不会忘记。在八年抗战期间，日本军国主义者对湖南人民进行了残酷的烧、杀和奸淫、掠夺，长沙市遭到一百多次轰炸，长沙、衡阳等二十多个市、县被屠杀和被摧残致死的人民达五十万以上。今天，美日反动派又策划新的侵略战争阴谋，引起了全市、全省人民的极大愤怒和坚决的反对。
    上午八时，人们抬着标语牌，高呼着口号，涌向各个集会场所。在人民会场集会的有八万人，出席大会的有人大常委会副委员长、国防委员会副主席、湖南省省长程潜，中共湖南省委书记谭余保，湖南军区政治委员晏福生和省、市党和政府的其他负责人，各人民团体、各民主党派负责人以及工人、居民、农民、部队官兵、民兵、学生等。在湖南帮助工作的苏联、捷克斯洛伐克专家和越南实习生也出席了大会。     
    中共湖南省委书记谭余保在大会上首先讲话。他说：“日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约，争取独立、民主、和平、中立的爱国正义斗争，加强了日本人民的团结，孤立了岸信介反动集团，揭露了美帝国主义复活日本军国主义和策划新战争的罪恶阴谋，对保卫亚洲和世界和平作出了重要贡献。我们湖南三千七百万人民同全国、全世界人民一起，对日本人民这种不屈不挠的英勇斗争表示坚决的支持和衷心的敬意。
    谭余保说：中日两国人民必须紧密团结起来，向美日反动派作坚决的斗争。他的讲话，不断被群众愤怒的口号声所打断。
    接着，各人民团体和民主党派地方组织负责人以及工人、农民、城市人民公社社员、学生代表等在会上讲了话。
    大会通过了湖南省各界人民支援日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的通电。接着，群众分三路举行了强大的示威游行。
    据新华社郑州15日电　河南省和郑州市各界二十五万人民，今天上午分六处举行集会和示威游行，坚决支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的正义斗争。
    大会的中心会场设在河南省体育场。中共河南省委书记处书记史向生、郑州市委第一书记王黎之等省市党政领导人，和省市各界负责人参加了大会。参加大会的，还有德意志民主共和国在郑州的专家和越南在河南的留学生等。
    愤怒的人群高呼“反对复活日本军国主义”、“打倒美帝国主义”等口号，一清早就抬着巨幅标语、漫画牌，从工厂、学校、机关、郊区人民公社向各个会场汇集。上万名全付武装的民兵，在六个会场上组成了严整的强大队伍。河南省第一个城市人民公社——红旗人民公社所在地，是抗日战争期间郑州市遭受日本法西斯残害最严重的一个区。今天，这个公社有位姓马的女社员，日本法西斯强盗在她临产时，在她的面前杀死了她的丈夫，从那时起她哭瞎了一只眼睛，成了半疯子。今天她在会上控诉了日本法西斯强盗在中国犯下的滔天罪行，表示坚决支持日本人民的正义斗争。
    中共河南省委书记处书记史向生在大会上讲话。他指出，日美军事同盟条约是一个彻头彻尾的侵略性条约，它严重地威胁着中国、苏联、朝鲜、越南及其他亚洲各国人民的安全，同时也必将把严重的灾难带给日本人民。他说，现在，全世界受压迫的人民，反帝风暴汹涌澎湃，这有力地冲击着美帝国主义及其走狗的反动统治。
    在大会上讲话的，还有河南省各人民团体和各民主党派地方组织的负责人，以及文教界、工商界、工人、农民、学生的代表等。
    大会最后通过了河南省和郑州市各界人民支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的通电。
