Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 28th—In Dehui County, Jilin Province, the site of the "Wanbaoshan Incident" fabricated by Japanese imperialism twenty-nine years ago, a rally was held on the 25th. The people present unanimously and resolutely opposed U.S. imperialism's revival of Japanese militarism and expressed their full support for the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.

From January to July 1931, Japanese militarists provoked ethnic disputes here, seized farmland, and killed and injured thousands of Chinese people as a prelude to their invasion of Northeast China. The people of Wanbaoshan have fresh memories of this crime of Japanese militarism. When the members of the Wanbaoshan People's Commune heard that U.S. imperialism was attempting to revive Japanese militarism and directing the Kishi Nobusuke reactionary traitorous clique to forcibly pass the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty illegally through the Japanese Diet, they were extremely angry. Old man Wang Baoxi, who was brutally beaten by Japanese militarists and narrowly escaped death in the "Wanbaoshan Incident," said: Twenty-nine years ago, Japanese imperialists fabricated the "Wanbaoshan Incident" to massacre our compatriots. Now, U.S. imperialism wants to revive Japanese militarism and launch a new war of aggression. It is truly a combination of old and new hatreds, making people infinitely resentful. He said: We want to warn the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries: The Chinese people will resolutely stand with the Japanese people and fight to the end against the revival of Japanese militarism. Seventy-three-year-old Tao Yin Song, who participated in the Wanbaoshan town's 3,000-person rally against the Japanese imperialist-created incident, said: The U.S. and Japanese reactionaries should open their eyes and see that the strength of the Chinese people is growing stronger day by day, and we will never allow U.S. imperialism to support Japanese militarism to enslave and oppress the Chinese and Japanese people. Many elderly and middle-aged commune members who personally suffered persecution by Japanese imperialism also took to the stage to denounce the crimes of Japanese imperialism and support the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle. Wang Decai, secretary of the Wanbaoshan People's Commune Party Committee, said at the rally: We, the 32,000 people of Wanbaoshan, will never forget the incident created by the Japanese robbers twenty-nine years ago. Like the people of the whole country, we resolutely stand with the Japanese people and oppose the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. (Attached picture)

    吉林万宝山人民愤怒集会
    反对美帝国主义扶植日本军国主义
    新华社长春28日电　二十九年前日本帝国主义一手制造的“万宝山事件”发生地——吉林省德惠县，25日举行集会，到会人民一致坚决反对美帝国主义复活日本军国主义，表示全力支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的爱国正义斗争。
    1931年1至7月，日本军国主义者在这里挑起民族纠纷，霸占民田并打死打伤几千名中国人民，作为它侵入我国东三省的先声。万宝山人民对日本军国主义这一罪行，记忆犹新。当万宝山人民公社社员们听到美帝国主义企图复活日本军国主义，指使岸信介反动卖国集团用暴力强迫日本国会非法通过日美军事同盟条约的时候，异常愤怒。在“万宝山事件”中遭受日本军国主义者毒打、死里逃生的王宝喜老大爷说：二十九年前，日本帝国主义者为屠杀我们的同胞，制造了“万宝山事件”。现在，美帝国主义又要复活日本军国主义，重新发动新的侵略战争，真是旧恨新仇，叫人无限愤恨。他说：我们要警告美日反动派：中国人民将坚决和日本人民站在一起，为反对复活日本军国主义而斗争到底。当年参加过万宝山镇三千人集会，反对日本帝国主义制造事件的七十三岁陶荫松老大爷说：美日反动派要睁开眼睛看看，今天中国人民的力量日益强大，决不允许美帝国主义扶植日本军国主义，奴役、欺压中国人民和日本人民了。许多亲身遭受过日本帝国主义迫害的老年和中年社员们，也纷纷在会上控诉了日本帝国主义的罪行，支持日本人民的爱国正义斗争。中共万宝山人民公社党委书记王德才在集会上说：我们万宝山三万二千人民，对二十九年前日本强盗制造的事件永远不会忘记，我们和全国人民一样，坚决和日本人民站在一起，反对日美军事同盟条约。（附图片）
