A major innovation in inland water transport in Jiaxing Prefecture
More Barges, Fewer Rudders, One-Person Operation
In the crisscrossing rivers of Hangjiahu, one can see tugboats towing long lines of six barges with only three rudders, easily steered by one person. The Jiaxing Prefecture Navigation Company of Zhejiang Province already has 880 barges operating with the advanced method of "six barges, three rudders, one-person operation." This was successfully tested by Wang Chuangui, a young barge worker and member of the Communist Youth League, and his crew. Wang Chuangui also invented the use of diesel engines to control the rudders, freeing barge workers from the heavy manual operation of steering. In the past, three people were needed to manage one boat; now, one person can manage more boats.

Now, the method of "six barges, three rudders, one-person operation" has been rapidly promoted throughout the prefecture. The Heping and Jiaxing business stations have further developed Wang Chuangui's experience and created "twelve barges, six rudders, one-person operation." Vessels using the method of more barges, fewer rudders, and one-person operation are constantly sailing on more than 20 shipping routes from Huzhou to Shanghai, Huzhou to Hangzhou, and others.

Since Jiaxing Prefecture fully promoted the method of one-person long-distance operation with more barges and fewer rudders, the entire company has saved more than 600 laborers. Due to the reduction in rudders, the speed of the barges has increased by 13% compared to the past, and the tonnage of the boats has also increased by 7%. Barges are now safer during navigation than in the past, changing the previous situation of "many people, many rudders, many ideas, twisting and turning when crossing bridges." At the same time, it has promoted profound changes in enterprise management. In the past, each boat operated independently; now, it is a collective life of a fleet of six or even twelve boats. Dining halls have been widely established on the fleets, and the crew members also have ample time to study politics and culture.　　　(Cheng Min)

    嘉兴专区内河运输的重大革新
    多驳少舵一人操作
    在杭嘉湖纵横交错的大小河流里，到处可以看到拖轮后面拖着长长的六条驳船，只有三个舵，由一个人轻便地驾驶着。浙江省嘉兴专区航运公司已有八百八十条驳船实行了“六驳三舵一人操作”的先进操作法。这是青年驳船工人、共青团员王传贵和船员们试验成功的。王传贵还创造了用柴油机操纵船舵，使驳船工人摆脱了掌舵上笨重的手工操作。过去三个人管一只船，现在一个人可以管更多的船了。
    现在，六驳三舵一人操作的方法，已迅速在全专区推广。和平、嘉兴等营业站还进一步发展了王传贵的经验，创造了十二驳六舵一人操作。多驳少舵一人操作的船只，不断航行在湖州到上海、湖州到杭州等二十多条船航线上。
    嘉兴地区全面推广多驳少舵一人远距离操作的办法后，全公司已节约了六百多个劳动力。由于舵减少，驳船的航速比前加快13％，船的吨位也扩大了7％。驳船在航行中比过去更加安全，改变了过去“人多、舵多、主意多，转弯过桥扭秧歌”的情况。同时促使企业管理发生深刻的变化。过去是一条船单家独户的经营，现在是六条船甚至十二条船一个船队的集体生活，船队上还普遍办了食堂，船员们也有充分时间学习政治、文化了。　　　（程敏）
