    To Fight Against Heaven
    Chen Wenhe, Zhangzhou, Fujian
    "Heaven" hasn't produced a thorough rain for several months now, and many crops need water. Especially in the south, early rice transplanting is complete, and spring plowing is in full swing. What to do if the sky doesn't rain? The answer: "If Heaven won't rain, people will make it rain!"
    "Ancient legends say dragons make rain; we are the rain-making dragons." The rain-making dragons are our heroic people. In the past, under reactionary rule, people were slaves to nature; but now, people are the masters of nature. This is because we already have the leadership of the Party, and we have been organized into "commune giants." Furthermore, we have accumulated rich experience and explored the laws of fighting disasters, so we can do without heaven, and we will certainly overcome heaven! Last August and September, southern Fujian suffered severe attacks from unprecedented typhoons and storm tides, but such great disasters were repelled by us, and large areas achieved yields of thousands of catties. In the Longxi area alone, five late-season "thousand-catty communes" emerged. We can subdue "dragons," and we can certainly bind the "drought demon." The Chendai Commune in Yunxiao County overcame a "hundred-day drought," enabling more than 20,000 mu of winter crops to grow well, and irrigated nearly 10,000 mu of fields ahead of schedule. The Wujiang Commune in Zhangpu County adopted measures such as opening canals along mountains, digging springs, opening ponds, deep ditches and high embankments, damming rivers, diverting water to multiple channels, and raising and reinforcing reservoirs and mountain ponds, greatly increasing water storage. Recently, more than 30,000 people in Longxi and Haicheng counties "wielded swords to chop the Nine Dragons," damming the Jiulong River, which can irrigate more than 160,000 mu of farmland.
    The drought resistance army is already engaged in a decisive battle with the drought demon. "Resisting drought until the sky lowers its head, ensuring a bumper harvest even without rain," this is the firm will of our heroic working people. A folk song says: "I have a pair of hands, rough skin and thick flesh, today engaged in production, I will fight against heaven. Command the water up the mountain, and the water will obediently go. The yield per mu must be doubled, don't even think of less!" This further expresses the heroic spirit of the commune members.

    要与老天斗
    福建漳州　陈文和
    “老天”已好几个月没下过透雨了，许多作物都需要水。特别是南方早稻插秧已经完毕，春耕进入大忙。天不下雨怎么办呢？答曰：“天不行雨人行雨！”
    “自古传说龙行雨，我们就是行雨龙”。行雨龙，就是我们英雄的人民。在过去反动统治年代，人是自然的奴隶；但是，现在，人是自然的主人了。这是因为，我们已经有了党的领导，又已经组织起来，成为“公社巨人”，另外，我们还积累了丰富的经验，摸索了抗灾斗争的规律，因此我们可以不靠天，而且一定能胜天！去年8、9月，福建南部遭受到了几十年来未有的大台风、大潮水的严重袭击，可是这样大的灾害都被我们击退了，而且获得了大面积的千斤产量，仅在龙溪专区就出现了五个晚季“千斤公社”。我们能够制服住“蛟龙”，也一定能够缚住“旱魔”。云霄陈岱公社就战胜“百日大旱”，使二万多亩冬种作物生长良好，并提前灌田近万亩。漳浦浯江公社采取依山开渠、挖泉水、开池塘、深沟高垒、断河拦坝、多水分渠、加高加固水库、山塘等办法，大大增加了蓄水量。新近龙溪、海澄两县三万多人“挥剑斩九龙”，把九龙江水堵住，可灌溉十六万多亩田地。
    抗旱大军已和旱魔进行决战。“抗旱抗到天低头，无雨也要保丰收”，这是我们英雄的劳动人民的坚强意志。有一首歌谣说：“我有一双手，皮粗肉又厚，今日闹生产，要与老天斗，指挥水上山，水得乖乖走，亩产要双千，休想少一斗！”这更道出了公社社员们的英雄气概。
