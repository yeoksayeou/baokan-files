Xinhua News Agency, 3rd dispatch from Tokyo: Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi and Postal Minister Haruhiko Uetake admitted today under questioning from members of the Diet that Japanese government authorities had engaged in military "cooperation" with the Chiang Kai-shek clique, antagonizing China.

Socialist Party Diet member Haruo Okada revealed today at a meeting of the House of Representatives' Special Committee on the "Security Treaty" that the Japanese government's "Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corporation" had conducted microwave surveys in Taiwan. He said: "This survey was conducted to build communication equipment for transmitting orders and intelligence to Chiang Kai-shek's army, directly linking Kinmen and Matsu with Taiwan. This shows that the government and the 'Procurement Department' of the US Forces in Japan have exceeded the scope of the Security Treaty and the Administrative Agreement to engage in military cooperation with Taiwan."

Postal Minister Haruhiko Uetake replied that the contract for the microwave survey was signed between the Procurement Department of the US Forces in Japan and the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corporation on June 28, 1957. The contract amount was more than 26,000 US dollars. Okada then pointed out that this survey was conducted under the supervision of the US military advisory group stationed in Taiwan and according to the specific instructions of the Chiang Kai-shek clique's army.

Okada pointed out that this was an expression of the Nobusuke Kishi government's military collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek clique to support the "counter-attack on the mainland" operation, and a manifestation of its policy of antagonizing China.

Postal Minister Haruhiko Uetake was forced to admit that "only the army's things were investigated in this survey; this is the truth." As a result, "this survey became cooperation for military purposes."

Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi also said: "Looking at the results, the survey was conducted for equipment used for military purposes." However, he quibbled, saying that the survey was conducted for "commercial purposes." He also shamelessly denied that it was a manifestation of a policy of antagonizing China.

    岸政府敌视中国的新罪行
    竟同蒋介石集团进行军事勾结
    新华社3日讯　东京消息：日本首相岸信介和邮政相植竹春彦今天在国会议员的追问下承认，日本政府当局曾经同蒋介石集团进行军事“合作”，敌视中国。
    社会党国会议员冈田春夫今天在众议院“安全条约”特别委员会会议上揭露日本政府的“电信电话国营公司”曾经在台湾进行微波调查。他说：“这项调查是为了建造传达蒋介石军队的命令和情报联系的通讯设备而进行的，直接把金门马祖同台湾连结起来。这说明，政府同驻日美军的‘调达部’已经超过安全条约和行政协定的范围同台湾进行军事合作。”
    邮政相植竹春彦回答说：调查微波的合同是驻日美军采购部和电信电话国营公司在1957年6月28日签订的。合同金额是二万六千多美元。冈田接着指出，这次调查是在驻台湾的美国军事顾问团的监督之下根据蒋介石集团的军队的具体指示进行的。
    冈田指出这是岸信介政府同蒋介石集团实行军事勾结，支援“反攻大陆”的行动，是敌视中国的政策的表现。
    邮政相植竹春彦被迫承认说：在这次调查中“只调查了军队的东西，这是真相。”结果，“这次调查变成为军事目的的合作”。
    日本首相岸信介也说：“从结果来看，是为利用于军备的设备进行了调查的”。但是，他又诡辩说：这次调查是根据“商业上的目的”而进行的。他还无耻地抵赖那不是敌视中国政策的表现。
