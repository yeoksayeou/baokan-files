Baotou, May 2nd (From Our Newspaper) - Baotou Steel's No. 1 giant open hearth furnace received strong Soviet assistance during its construction.

As early as 1957, the Soviet State Design Institute sent the complete set of construction drawings for the open hearth furnace to the Baotou Steel construction site. In 1958, the Baotou Steel Design Institute made some modifications to adapt to the special conditions of the Baotou area. In order to do this work well, in July 1959, the Soviet Union sent expert Koshelev, the dean of the Ferrous Metallurgy Design Branch, and chief engineer Andreyev to Baotou Steel to carefully review the revised design and provide many valuable opinions on all aspects, from the layout of the open hearth furnace to the structure and model of the furnace body. Later, the Soviet Union sent design materials such as ingot casting, ingot stripping, and cranes from Leningrad to help Baotou Steel overcome design difficulties and smoothly start the construction of the open hearth furnace project.

After the open hearth furnace construction entered the equipment installation stage, workers from many machinery and electrical manufacturing plants in the Soviet Union, such as Moscow Dynamo, Leningrad, New Kramatorsk, and Kharkov, tried their best to rush-produce more than 1,200 tons of equipment for Baotou Steel and delivered them ahead of schedule. The 350-ton giant crane was originally planned to be delivered at the end of this year, but due to the Great Leap Forward in Baotou Steel's construction, the construction period of the open hearth furnace was repeatedly advanced, and it was required that the giant crane also be delivered ahead of schedule. After day and night rush production by relevant Soviet factories, all the crane equipment was shipped to Baotou Steel in February of this year, and soon the second set of spare parts was also shipped one after another.

Soviet experts, led by Soviet deputy expert group leader Kruklikov, frequently went to the construction site to guide construction during the construction of the open hearth furnace. Pipeline expert Sidorinko suggested adopting factory-based integrated installation in the installation of the open hearth furnace vaporization cooling system, which completed the project originally scheduled for more than ten days in fifty hours. In order to solve the problem of a large number of pipe bending, expert Sidorinko also created a pipe bending machine with the workers. Metal structure expert Kruklikov suggested using electric riveting to reinforce and overcome the defects of the flat columns of the open hearth furnace, so that all the original 280 tons of flat steel that could not be used were utilized. He also guided and helped workers overcome the new electroslag welding technology, and timely solved the problem of welding strength of large flat steel columns.

Baotou, May 2nd (From Our Newspaper) - More than 290 factories and enterprises across the country contributed to the No. 1 open hearth furnace system project of Baotou Steel. They produced more than 52,000 tons of building materials and equipment for the No. 1 open hearth furnace project of Baotou Steel, which played a huge role in ensuring that Baotou Steel's "Open Hearth Furnace King" was completed and produced steel one year ahead of schedule.

When producing these building materials and equipment, factories in various places displayed a high degree of communist collaboration spirit and initiative, and most of them were able to deliver goods ahead of schedule. When the Xi'an Mercury Rectifier Factory produced equipment such as moving rectifiers and heat exchangers for the No. 4 substation of Baotou Steel's No. 1 open hearth furnace, it was originally scheduled to deliver the goods at the end of the second quarter. When the workers of this factory heard that Baotou Steel was going to produce steel on "May 1st," they immediately started rushing to produce and shipped the equipment to the Baotou Steel construction site on April 3. When the Shanghai Electrical Machinery Factory produced electrical equipment for the 350-ton giant crane for Baotou Steel, it was a trial-produced product, and it was originally planned to deliver the goods at the end of the third quarter. After the factory received the news that Baotou Steel required early delivery, the factory director personally arranged the production plan and completed all the production in only twenty days, and the quality was qualified. Jinzhou Continental Machinery Factory, Shanghai Jiaodian Factory, Xiangtan Electric Machinery Factory, Shenyang Fan Factory, Wuhan Iron and Steel Company, Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, etc., also rushed to produce a lot of building materials and equipment for Baotou Steel ahead of schedule. Dalian Mining Vehicle Factory also sent experienced veteran workers to help Baotou Steel workers assemble.

The workers of Anshan Iron and Steel, the "steel capital" of the motherland, regarded supporting the construction of Baotou Steel as their glorious task. Almost all the steel and heavy rails used in the No. 1 open hearth furnace system project were supplied by Anshan Iron and Steel. Before the No. 1 open hearth furnace produced steel, there was an urgent need to lay eight kilometers of heavy rails. At that time, all the goods ordered by Baotou Steel from Anshan Iron and Steel had been shipped back and used up. After the workers of Anshan Iron and Steel learned that Baotou Steel urgently needed these heavy rails for steel production, they immediately allocated a part of their own heavy rails to ensure the urgent needs of Baotou Steel. The No. 1 open hearth furnace of Baotou Steel needed two 350-ton ingot casting cranes for steel production. After being shipped from abroad, one was short of electrical equipment, and it was too late to rush to produce it. After Anshan Iron and Steel learned of this news, it immediately shipped all the electrical equipment of a 270-ton crane that was on standby for production to Baotou Steel. In order to support the start-up production of the No. 1 open hearth furnace of Baotou Steel, various steelmaking plants of Anshan Iron and Steel also supported Baotou Steel with more than 280 steelmaking workers, and were responsible for training a large number of production workers for the Baotou Steel Steelmaking Plant.

The 2,000-meter pipeline installation project of the vaporization cooling system of Baotou Steel's No. 1 giant open hearth furnace was completed in fifty hours due to the adoption of the integrated installation proposal put forward by Soviet expert Sidorinko.

### 包钢平炉建设得到苏联大力支援  全国大批企业支援了包钢提前出钢

    包钢平炉建设得到苏联大力支援
    全国大批企业支援了包钢提前出钢
    本报包头2日电　包钢一号巨型平炉在建设过程中得到苏联大力援助。
    远在1957年，苏联国家设计院就把平炉施工的全套图纸送到了包钢工地。1958年，包钢设计院为适应包头地区的特殊情况，进行了某些修改；为了做好这一工作，1959年7月间，苏联又派黑色冶金设计分院院长柯希列夫专家、总工程师安德列耶夫来到包钢，详细地审查修改后的设计，从平炉布置、炉体结构型号等各方面，提供了许多宝贵意见。以后，苏联又将铸锭、脱锭、吊车等设计资料，从列宁格勒源源寄来，帮助包钢排除设计上的难关，使平炉工程顺利地开始了施工。
    平炉建设进入设备安装阶段以后，苏联莫斯科狄纳莫、列宁格勒、新克拉马托尔斯克、哈尔科夫等许多机械和电气制造厂的职工，千方百计为包钢赶制了一千二百多吨设备，并且提前交货。三百五十吨巨型吊车，原计划是今年年末交货，可是由于包钢建设大跃进，平炉工期一再提前，要求大吊车也得提前交货；经过苏联各有关工厂的昼夜赶制，在今年2月份就把吊车的设备全部运到了包钢，不久第二台备品也相继运到。
    以苏联代理专家组长克鲁克里柯夫为首的苏联专家们，在平炉施工过程中经常深入现场，指导施工。管道专家西多林柯在平炉汽化冷却系统安装中建议采用工厂化的整体安装，使原订工期为十多天的工程在五十个小时就干完了。西多林柯专家为了解决大量的煨管问题，还同工人一道创造了煨管机。金属结构专家克鲁克里柯夫建议用电铆加固，克服了平炉扁柱的缺陷，使原来不能用的二百八十吨扁钢全部利用上了。他还指导和帮助工人攻克了电渣焊新技术，及时解决了大型扁钢柱焊接强度问题。
    本报包头2日电　全国各地有二百九十多个工厂企业为包钢一号平炉系统的工程贡献了力量。它们为包钢一号平炉工程生产了五万两千多吨建筑材料和设备，对于保证包钢“平炉王”提前一年建成出钢，起了巨大作用。
    各地工厂在生产这些建筑材料和设备时，发扬了高度的共产主义协作精神和主动性，绝大部分都能提前交货。西安水银整流器厂为包钢一号平炉四号变电所生产移向器和热交换器等设备时，原订二季度末交货；当这个厂的职工听说包钢要“五一”出钢，立即着手赶制，4月3日就把设备运到包钢工地。上海机电厂为包钢生产三百五十吨巨型吊车的电器设备时，因为是试制产品，原计划三季度末才能交货；工厂得到包钢要求提前交货的消息以后，厂长亲自安排生产计划，只用二十天时间就全部生产出来，而且质量合格。锦州大陆机械厂、上海交电厂、湘潭电机厂、沈阳扇风机厂、武汉钢铁公司、石景山钢铁公司等，也都提前为包钢赶制了许多建筑材料和设备。大连工矿车辆厂还派来经验丰富的老工人，帮助包钢工人进行组装。
    祖国“钢都”——鞍钢的工人们，把支援包钢建设看成是自己的光荣任务。一号平炉系统工程所用的钢材、重轨，几乎全是由鞍钢供应的。一号平炉出钢前急需铺设八公里的重轨，当时，包钢向鞍钢订的货已全部运回用完；鞍钢职工知道包钢出钢急需这些重轨的情况以后，立即把自己的重轨拨出一部分，保证了包钢急需。包钢一号平炉出钢需要两台三百五十吨铸锭吊车，从国外运来后，有一台缺电器设备，赶制又来不及，鞍钢得知这一消息以后，立即把生产上备用的一台二百七十吨吊车的全部电器设备运到包钢。为了支援包钢一号平炉开炉生产，鞍钢各炼钢厂还支援了包钢二百八十多名炼钢工人，并且负责为包钢炼钢厂培训了大批生产工人。（附图片）
