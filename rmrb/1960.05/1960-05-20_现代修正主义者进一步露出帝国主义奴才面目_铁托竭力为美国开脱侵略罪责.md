Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, 18th Dispatch: Yugoslav President Tito, in a statement to Yugoslav News Agency reporters on the 17th, described the U.S. plane intrusion into Soviet airspace, which was being denounced by people all over the world, as not the "main event now." He also attacked the Soviet Union, saying that the U.S. plane intrusion into Soviet airspace "should not" become "a pretext for disputes of such magnitude."

In his statement, Tito tried every possible means to excuse and exonerate the United States from its crime of aggression. Although he said in his statement that he wanted to condemn the U.S. behavior, he only mentioned "U.S. planes flying into Soviet airspace" and "a huge event occurred between the United States and the Soviet Union." Throughout the statement, he did not dare to use the words "aggression" or "provocation" against the United States, and he tried his best to conceal the serious nature of the event.

Tito feigned "great worry and unease" about the breakdown of the Four-Power Summit, but he avoided talking about the U.S. act of aggression against the Soviet Union and its persistence in continuing this shameless act that ruined the Four-Power Summit and endangered world peace. Instead, he deliberately attacked the Soviet Union's exposure of the U.S. act of aggression. He said, "Indeed, a huge event occurred between the United States and the Soviet Union... Is this the main event now? Should it become a pretext for disputes of such magnitude? Of course, it doesn't need to and shouldn't be like this, even if it only restores the Cold War..."

Tito pretended to safeguard world peace, using this as an excuse to vehemently oppose the Soviet Union and the people of the world in exposing and condemning the shameless acts of the U.S. warmongers. This can be more clearly illustrated by the remarks of senior Yugoslav officials and its newspapers.

Yugoslav State Secretary for Foreign Affairs Popovic, in a speech to the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Yugoslav Federal National Assembly on the 13th, described the incident in which a U.S. plane intruding into Soviet airspace was shot down as "an unfortunate act." He also indiscriminately called on the Soviet Union and the United States to "work together" to eliminate the "negative consequences" caused by this incident.

The Yugoslav propaganda machine also tried its best to defend the U.S. imperialist crime of aggression. "Borba" openly slandered the Soviet Union and world public opinion's condemnation of the United States as "disturbing the international atmosphere." The newspaper's commentary on the 11th said: "Some people are talking in detail about Captain Powers flying over the Soviet Union. They are obviously most interested in disturbing the entire international atmosphere on the eve of the Paris conference in order to reduce the chances of reaching an agreement to a minimum." The newspaper also implied that continuing to expose U.S. crimes would be committing an "unforgivable mistake." "Politika's" commentary on the 15th even more desperately exonerated the U.S. plane's crime of intruding into Soviet airspace. The newspaper said plausibly: This provocative incident "should not darken the prospects of the (summit conference)"; and also said something like "There is no need to burn down the house to eliminate bedbugs." It also sarcastically condemned the Soviet Union for "not coming to Paris with good intentions and any hope."

### 现代修正主义者进一步露出帝国主义奴才面目  铁托竭力为美国开脱侵略罪责

    现代修正主义者进一步露出帝国主义奴才面目
    铁托竭力为美国开脱侵略罪责
    新华社18日讯　贝尔格莱德消息：南斯拉夫总统铁托17日向南斯拉夫通讯社记者发表谈话，把全世界人民同声怒斥的美机侵犯苏联领空事件说做并不是“现在的主要事件”。他并且攻击苏联说，美机侵犯苏联的事件“不应该”成为“具有这样规模的争执的借口”。
    铁托在谈话中千方百计替美国的侵略罪行掩饰和开脱。他在谈话中虽说要谴责美国的行为，但他只说
  “美国飞机飞入苏联领空”，“美国和苏联之间发生了巨大的事情”，通篇对美国不敢用“侵略”“挑衅”一词，竭力掩盖这一事件的严重性质。
    铁托假意装作对四国首脑会议的决裂“感到极大的担心和不安”，但他避而不谈美国的对苏联的侵略行为和坚持继续这种无耻行径破坏了四国首脑会议，危及世界和平的罪责，反而刻意攻击苏联对美国侵略行为的揭发。他说，“不错，在美国和苏联之间发生了巨大的事情……。这难道是现在的主要事件吗？它难道应该成为具有这样规模的争执的借口吗？当然它不需要而且不应该这样，即使这只是使冷战恢复……”
    铁托假装维护世界和平，借此竭力反对苏联和全世界人民揭露和谴责美国战争贩子的无耻行径，从南斯拉夫的高级官员和它的报刊的言论可以得到更清楚的说明。
    南斯拉夫外交国务秘书长波波维奇13日在南斯拉夫联邦国民议会外交委员会的讲话中，把由于美国飞机侵入苏联领空而遭到击落的事件，说成是“一个不幸的行动”。他并且不分皂白地要求苏联和美国“共同努力”来消除这一事件所引起的“消极后果”。
    南斯拉夫的宣传机器也竭力为美帝国主义的侵略罪行辩解，“战斗报”公然诬蔑苏联和世界舆论对美国的谴责是“扰乱国际气氛”。这家报纸11日的评论说：“有些人就在苏联上空飞行的事详细谈论鲍尔士上尉，他们显然在巴黎会议前夕对扰乱整个国际气氛最感兴趣，以便使达成协议的机会减少到最低限度”。这家报纸还暗示，如果继续揭发美国的罪行，就会犯
  “不可宽恕的错误”。“政治报”15日的评论则更是拼命为美机侵犯苏联领空的罪行开脱。这家报纸振振有词地说：这一挑衅事件“不应当使（政府首脑会议）前景阴暗”；还说什么“为了消灭臭虫，不必烧毁房屋”。它并且含沙射影地谴责苏联“不应该不怀着善良愿望和任何希望来到巴黎”。
