Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 10th. Premier Pham Van Dong's speech at Hanoi Airport in full is as follows: Respected Comrade Premier Zhou Enlai! Respected Comrade Vice-Premier Chen Yi! Comrades, friends!

    This morning, as the dawn was rising, our capital Hanoi had the honor and pleasure of welcoming our distinguished guests once again. On behalf of the Vietnamese people, the Central Committee of the Vietnam Labor Party, and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, I extend a warm welcome to Comrade Premier, Comrade Vice-Premier, and all the comrades accompanying them. This is your second visit to our country since the restoration of peace, bringing with you the profound friendship of the Chinese people. The Vietnamese people warmly welcome you, the beloved friends of the Vietnamese people, the envoys of peace and friendship.

    We welcome you and congratulate Comrade Premier on the excellent results achieved during your visit to several Asian countries. It has consolidated and developed the friendly and cooperative relations between Asian countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. This is a prominent and powerful manifestation of the peaceful and friendly foreign policy of the People's Republic of China, a peace-loving great power that is building its new life in Chinese history with unprecedented scale and speed and setting a brilliant example for the people of the world.

    Just as the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the peace-loving people of the world are striving to defend peace and promote the easing of international tensions, the aggressive US imperialism is still pursuing its so-called "policy of strength" and engaging in an arms race, deliberately creating tensions before the convening of the summit conference. In the Far East and Southeast Asia, we have clearly seen the US imperialists' warlike and aggressive ambitions in the Taiwan area, South Korea, South Vietnam, Laos, and other regions. The Vietnamese people deeply hate the fact that US imperialism and its lackeys are blatantly and unprecedentedly severely undermining the Geneva Accords, increasing the military personnel of the "US Military Assistance Advisory Group" stationed in South Vietnam.

    In order to oppose and defeat the aggressive and war-mongering conspiracies of US imperialism, to consolidate and safeguard peace, and to strive for and defend national independence, the people of the world should further strengthen unity and struggle, and constantly heighten their vigilance.

    Our era is one in which the forces of socialism far outweigh the imperialist bloc, in which the working people and oppressed nations have risen one after another to dominate their own destiny, an era of the collapse of colonialism and the decline of imperialism. Victory will surely belong to the people.

    Comrade Premier! Just as our people in the North are joyously electing representatives to the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Comrade Premier, Comrade Vice-Premier, and all the comrades accompanying them have come to visit our country. We express our sincere gratitude. We firmly believe that this friendly visit of yours will further strengthen the fraternal friendship between our two countries and strengthen the unbreakable unity of the socialist camp headed by the great Soviet Union. Your visit is a great encouragement to the Vietnamese people who are carrying out socialist construction in the North and struggling to unify their fatherland.

    I wish Comrade Premier and all other comrades good health.

    在河内机场上范文同总理的讲话
    新华社河内10日电　范文同总理在河内机场讲话全文如下：敬爱的周恩来总理同志！敬爱的陈毅副总理同志！同志们，朋友们！
    今天上午，当晨光正在升起的时候，我们首都河内又有机会荣幸地和愉快地迎接我们的贵宾。我谨代表越南人民、越南劳动党中央、越南民主共和国政府向总理同志、副总理同志及随行的全体同志表示热烈的欢迎。自从和平恢复以来，这是你第二次访问我们的国家，给我国人民带来了中国人民深厚的情谊。越南人民热烈欢迎你，越南人民敬爱的朋友，和平友谊的使者。
    我们欢迎你们，我们祝贺总理同志在亚洲一些国家的访问所取得的美好结果。它在和平共处五项原则的基础上巩固和发展了亚洲各国的友好合作关系。这是在中国历史上以空前未有的规模和速度建设自己的新生活，并为世界人民立下了光辉范例的世界上的一个和平强国——中华人民共和国和平友好的外交政策显著、有力的表现。
    正当以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和世界爱好和平人民一道竭力地捍卫和平，促使国际局势趋于缓和的时候，侵略成性的美帝国主义竞仍然继续实行所谓“实力政策”和进行军备竞赛，别有用心地在最高级会议召开之前制造紧张局势。在远东和东南亚地区，我们已经看透了美帝国主义在台湾地区，南朝鲜，南越，老挝及其他地区的好战和侵略的野心。越南人民深深痛恨美帝国主义及其走狗正在明目张胆地前所未有地严重破坏日内瓦协议，增加驻在越南南方的“美国军事援助顾问团”的军事人员。
    为反对和击败美帝国主义的侵略和战争阴谋，为巩固和维护和平，为争取与维护民族独立，世界人民应该进一步加强团结和斗争，不断地提高警惕。
    我们的时代是社会主义力量大大超过帝国主义集团，是劳动人民、各被压迫民族先后站起来主宰自己的命运的时代，是殖民主义瓦解的时代，是帝国主义衰退的时代，胜利一定属于人民。
    总理同志！正当我们北方人民在欢欣鼓舞的气氛中改选出越南民主共和国国会代表的时候，总理同志、副总理同志与随行的全体同志前来我国访问。我们表示真挚的感谢。我们深信你们这次的友好访问将进一步加强我们两国之间兄弟的亲谊，加强以伟大的苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国牢不可破的团结一致。你们的访问对于正在进行北方的社会主义建设和为争取统一自己祖国而斗争的越南人民是一种莫大的鼓舞。
    敬祝总理同志和其他同志身体健康。
