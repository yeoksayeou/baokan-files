    Everyone Praises "Panda" as Good,
    But "Taihu" Will Surpass "Panda"
    The workers of Wuxi Radio Factory unanimously stated at the factory-wide mobilization meeting for "Learning from Shanghai and Catching Up with Nanjing" that they are determined to make the quality of the Taihu brand radios produced by the factory catch up with the Panda brand radios produced by Nanjing Radio Factory within the year.
    Aiming at the advantages of Panda brand radios, such as sturdy and durable component structure, good electrical performance stability, high sensitivity, and beautiful appearance, all the workers of the factory analyzed and compared them with the Taihu brand produced by the factory, identified the key points in production, and immediately proposed improvement measures. In order to ensure that the quality of components and assemblies fully meets the standards, the workers strictly implement the process regulations. The design department immediately started designing various new and beautiful shells, and contacted the processing plant to ensure that the manufactured products were not distorted; the product and semi-finished product quality inspection system was also established and improved in the department management departments to ensure that each part is qualified.

    人人都称“熊猫”好
    “太湖”却要胜“熊猫”
    无锡无线电厂职工，在“学上海、赶南京”的全厂誓师行动大会上一致表示，决心要在年内使本厂生产的太湖牌收音机的质量赶上南京无线电厂熊猫牌收音机。
    全厂职工针对熊猫牌收音机的机件结构坚固耐用、电气性能稳定性好、灵敏度高、美观大方等优点，和本厂生产的太湖牌进行分析对比，找出生产上的关键，立即提出改进措施。工人们为了保证元件、组件质量完全符合标准，都严格执行工艺规程。设计部门立即动手设计多种新型美观的外壳，并且和加工厂联系，保证制造成品不走样；在科室管理部门也建立了和健全产品和半成品质量检验制度，保证零件个个合格。　（陈恂勤）
