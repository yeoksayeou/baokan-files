The United States single-handedly strangled the Four-Power Summit Conference, but attempted to shift the responsibility for the failure of the conference onto the Soviet Union. Aided by the Western propaganda machine, it tried its best to attack the Soviet Union for "unwillingness to negotiate" and "deliberately sabotaging the great power meeting." U.S. President Eisenhower openly slandered the Soviet Union on May 16, claiming the Soviet Union was "determined to wreck the Paris conference," while stating that "we Americans came here to sincerely consider the major issues facing this conference" and "promote a just peace."

Can this kind of black-and-white reversal fool anyone? It is universally recognized that the Four-Power Summit Conference was undermined because the United States insisted on its provocative policy toward the Soviet Union. Moreover, it is also very clear that the United States has never harbored good intentions towards the Four-Power Summit Conference. Facts, both past and present, prove that the United States is the culprit deliberately undermining the Four-Power Summit Conference.

As everyone knows, the United States has never been willing to hold summit conferences. Responsible officials of the U.S. government, such as Nixon, openly clamored against negotiating with the Soviet Union. For years, the Soviet Union's efforts to convene a summit conference of great powers have been constantly obstructed by the United States. As late as July of last year, Eisenhower declared: "Our attitude here has always been that it is not useful to convene or participate in a top-level meeting." In September last year, during the visit of Comrade Khrushchev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, to the United States, he once again put forward positive suggestions. Under the pressure of world public opinion, the United States had no choice but to agree to hold a summit conference. However, since then, responsible officials of the United States have continued to clamor that "it is necessary to maintain strong defenses" and "deal with the Soviet Union from a position of strength." U.S. President Eisenhower even declared that America's "deterrent power" was "an indispensable prerequisite" for "exploring the possibility of reaching an agreement" with the Soviet Union. At the same time, the United States did its best to spread an atmosphere of pessimism and failure about the summit conference. At the beginning of this year, United Press International also pointed out: "The Eisenhower administration, with the help of the French and West German governments, has begun a propaganda campaign to prepare the public for the failure of the May summit conference. State Department officials will deliver more speeches related to this warning in the next three months." Later facts fully confirmed this prediction by the American news agency.

On March 22, U.S. Secretary of State Herter openly described the summit conference as "a gamble" while testifying in the Senate, and indicated that the United States would participate in the Four-Power Summit Conference in a situation of "no purpose, no plan and no hope of success."

On April 4, Herter said in another speech: "If anyone expects to achieve remarkable achievements at the top-level meeting, he may be disappointed."

On April 20, U.S. Under Secretary of State Dillon clamored that "we must not be deceived by any superficial 'reconciliation' gestures." He openly declared: "In fact, the word 'coexistence' is both terrible and hateful," "Therefore, let us throw this temporary, unnatural idea of coexistence into the trash heap."

On May 2, Eisenhower said in a letter to the foreign ministers of the North Atlantic Group: "We have no reason to expect any rapid or remarkable results (from the Four-Power Summit Conference)."

These remarks by responsible U.S. officials were not without basis, because the United States had made full preparations to ensure that the Four-Power Summit Conference would achieve nothing. For months, the United States and its Western partners have conducted very frequent diplomatic activities. At the end of last year, the West successively held the North Atlantic Group Council and the summit conference of the United States, Britain, France and West Germany in Paris. At the meeting, in order to "completely eliminate" the "bad influence" of Comrade Khrushchev's visit to the United States ("Stars and Stripes"), the United States deliberately spread arguments that doubted and slandered the Soviet Union, clamoring that "the defense forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization alliance and further strengthening of these forces are still of fundamental importance." At the same time, the communique of the Western summit "reiterated" the "rigid position" of obstructing the solution of the West Berlin and German questions. In March of this year, the United States invited "Cold War knight" Adenauer to Washington. Afterwards, Eisenhower announced that "neither side has changed its policy," "We will never give up our rights in Berlin." Following this, British Prime Minister Macmillan and French President De Gaulle were also invited to the United States successively to discuss matters with Eisenhower. On the eve of the Four-Power Summit Conference, this kind of diplomatic activity became even more frequent: in mid-April, the United States, Britain, France and West Germany held a foreign ministers' meeting in Washington. At the beginning of May, the North Atlantic Group convened a council in Istanbul. Even a day or two before the Four-Power Summit Conference, the heads of the three Western countries conducted secret talks with Adenauer. This series of diplomatic activities by the United States was all in order to formulate their countermeasures at the Four-Power Summit Conference. What kind of "countermeasures" did the United States and its Western partners formulate? According to public disclosures by Western officials, the United States was prepared to: (1) continue to insist on so-called "effective international supervision" as a prerequisite for disarmament; (2) on the issue of stopping nuclear tests, only "agree to a short-term voluntary suspension of tests," and be unwilling to reach a comprehensive and permanent agreement with the Soviet Union to stop nuclear tests; (3) resolutely oppose the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, and insist on the long-outdated "free elections" as the "only practical way" to solve the German unification issue; (4) on the Berlin issue, "not accept any arrangement that may lead to the abandonment of West Berlin." As everyone knows, the Four-Power Summit Conference was preparing to discuss major international issues such as universal disarmament, the cessation of nuclear tests, the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the West Berlin issue, and East-West relations. Before the meeting, the United States was already confident and had formulated "countermeasures" to obstruct the solution of these problems, which was clearly intended to undermine the discussions of the Four-Power Summit Conference. Eisenhower even said that he was willing to "sincerely consider the major issues facing this conference," which is extremely hypocritical.

The United States apparently felt that this was not enough to wreck the Four-Power Summit Conference, so it frantically intensified the "Cold War" before the meeting and exacerbated international tensions, creating a bad atmosphere for the Four-Power Summit Conference. For months, the United States has not stopped its activities of expanding its military and preparing for war for a single day. It frantically expanded its military strength, focusing on the development of missile weapons, strengthened various military blocs, expanded missile bases, stepped up support for Japan and West Germany, the two sources of war, and actively carried out war deployments and military exercises in various places, while the war clamoring issued by American civil and military officials against the Soviet Union and other socialist countries was even more frequent. As the Four-Power Summit Conference approached, the United States' "Cold War" activities became even more rampant, even developing to the point of openly dispatching military aircraft to intrude into Soviet territory to carry out provocations, attempting to use force to threaten the Soviet Union. Not content with this, the U.S. ruling clique, on May 7, Eisenhower again ordered the resumption of underground nuclear tests, and even a few hours before the start of the Four-Power Summit Conference, U.S. Secretary of Defense Gates ordered a so-called "alert exercise" to be carried out in the U.S. and American armed forces around the world to create a war atmosphere. All this fully proves that the United States has no sincerity towards the Four-Power Summit Conference. Therefore, when the Soviet Union solemnly stated that it could not tolerate the aggressive acts of the United States and demanded that the U.S. government admit its mistake and apologize, the United States did not hesitate to undermine the Four-Power Summit Conference by rejecting the legitimate demands of the Soviet Union. As long as one notes the United States' consistent and deliberate acts to undermine the summit conference, one will not be surprised at all by the United States' blatant strangling of this conference. The United States' attempt to escape the guilt of undermining the Four-Power Summit Conference is absolutely impossible.

    美国罪责难逃
    林生
    美国一手扼杀了四国首脑会议，却企图把这次会议流产的责任推到苏联的身上，而且得到西方宣传机器的帮腔，竭力攻击苏联“不愿谈判”、“蓄意破坏大国会议”。美国总统艾森豪威尔在5月16日公然诬蔑苏联“决心破坏巴黎会议”。而说什么“我们美国人到这里来是为了真诚地考虑这次会议所面临的重大问题”，“促进正义的和平”的。
    这种颠倒黑白的手法能骗得了谁呢？四国首脑会议由于美国坚持它对苏联的挑衅政策而遭到破坏，这是人所共见的。而且人们也很清楚，美国对于四国首脑会议一直就不怀好意。不论过去和当前的事实，都证明了美国是蓄意破坏四国首脑会议的罪魁。
    大家知道，美国从来就是不愿意举行首脑会议的。美国政府的负责官员如尼克松之流公开叫嚣反对同苏联谈判。几年以来，苏联为争取召开大国首脑会议的努力都不断遭到美国阻拒。艾森豪威尔在去年7月还声言：“我们这里始终采取着这样的态度，那就是，召开或者参加一次最高级会议是没有益处的。”去年9月间，苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫同志访问美国，再一次提出积极的建议，在世界舆论的压力下，美国才不得不同意举行首脑会议。但是在那以后，美国的负责官员仍然不断叫嚷“必须在防御上保持强大”，“从实力出发同苏联打交道”。而美国总统艾森豪威尔甚至宣称，美国的“威慑力量”是同苏联“探索达成协议可能性”的“一个必不可少的前提”。在此同时，美国又竭力为首脑会议散布悲观和失败的空气。今年年初合众国际社也指出：“艾森豪威尔政府在法国和西德政府的帮助下，已经开始了一个使公众对5月的最高级会议有失败的准备的宣传运动。国务院官员们在今后三个月内将发表更多的有关这种警告的演说。”后来的事实完全证实了这个美国通讯社的预言。
    3月22日美国国务卿赫脱在参议院作证时公开把首脑会议说成是“一场赌博”，并且表示美国将在“没有目的、没有计划和没有成功希望”的情况下去参加四国首脑会议。
    4月4日赫脱在另一次演说中又说：“如果任何人期望在最高级会议上获得引人注目的成就，他可能会失望”。
    4月20日美国副国务卿狄龙叫嚷“我们决不能为任何表面上的‘和解’姿态所欺骗”。他公然宣称：“实际上，‘共处’这个字眼是既可怕又可恶的”，“因此让我们把这种暂时的、不自然的共处观念抛进垃圾堆。”
    5月2日艾森豪威尔在给北大西洋集团外长们的信中表示：“我们没有理由预期（四国首脑会议）会有任何迅速的或引人注目的结果。”
    美国负责官员的这些言论并不是没有根据的，因为美国为了使四国首脑会议毫无成就已进行了充分的准备。几个月来，美国同它的西方伙伴进行了十分频繁的外交活动。去年年底西方接连在巴黎举行了北大西洋集团理事会和美、英、法、西德四国首脑会议。在会上为了“完全消除”赫鲁晓夫同志访美的“坏影响”（美“明星晚报”），美国故意散布怀疑和诬蔑苏联的论调，叫嚷“北大西洋公约组织联盟的防御力量和进一步加强这种力量仍然具有根本的重要意义。”同时西方首脑会议的公报更“重申”了阻挠解决西柏林和德国问题的“僵硬立场”。今年3月美国请了“冷战骑士”阿登纳去华盛顿。事后艾森豪威尔宣布“双方中的任何一方都没有改变政策”，“我们决不放弃我们在柏林的权利”。跟着，英国首相麦克米伦和法国总统戴高乐也先后应邀赴美，分别同艾森豪威尔商谈。在四国首脑会议前夕，这种外交活动更形繁忙：4月中，美、英、法、西德在华盛顿举行了外长会议。5月初北大西洋集团又在伊斯坦布尔召开理事会。甚至在四国首脑会议前一两天，西方三国首脑还同阿登纳进行了密谈。美国的这一系列的外交活动，都是为了制定它们在四国首脑会议上的对策。美国和它的西方伙伴制定的是什么样的“对策”呢？根据西方官员公开透露的，美国准备：（一）继续坚持所谓“有效的国际监督”作为裁军的先决条件；（二）在停止核试验问题上，只“同意短期的自愿暂停试验的做法”，而不愿同苏联达成全面永远停止核试验的协议；（三）坚决反对缔结对德和约，坚持早已行不通的“自由选举”作为解决德国统一的“唯一切实可行的办法”；（四）在柏林问题上“不接受可能导向放弃西柏林的任何安排”。大家知道，四国首脑会议是准备讨论普遍裁军、停止核试验，缔结对德和约和西柏林问题、东西方关系等重大国际问题的。而在开会之前，美国已经胸有成竹，制定好了阻挠解决这些问题的“对策”，这明显地是要破坏四国首脑会议的讨论。艾森豪威尔居然还说什么愿意“真诚地考虑这次会议所面临的重大问题”，是何等的虚伪。
    美国显然认为这还不足以搞垮四国首脑会议，因此它在会议举行之前拼命加紧“冷战”，加剧国际紧张局势，为四国首脑会议创造恶劣的气氛。几个月来，美国一天也没有停止过扩军备战的活动。它疯狂地扩充以发展导弹武器为重点的军事力量，加强各种军事集团，扩建导弹基地，加紧扶植日本和西德这两个战争策源地，积极在各地进行战争部署和军事演习，而美国文武官员对苏联和其他社会主义国家发出的战争叫嚣，则更是无日无之。随着四国首脑会议的日益临近，美国的“冷战”活动更加猖狂，甚至发展到公然派遣军用飞机侵入苏联国境进行挑衅，企图用武力来威胁苏联。美国统治集团这样还以为未足，艾森豪威尔在5月7日又再下令恢复地下核试验，甚至在四国首脑会议开始之前几小时，美国国防部长盖茨还下令在美国和全世界的美国武装部队进行一次所谓“戒备演习”，以制造战争空气。所有这一切充分证明美国对于四国首脑会议是毫无诚意的。因此当苏联严正地表示不能忍受美国的侵略行为，要求美国政府认错和道歉，美国就毫不犹豫地以拒绝苏联的正当要求来破坏了四国首脑会议。只要注意到美国一贯蓄意破坏首脑会议的行径，对于美国悍然扼杀这次会议的做法就毫不觉得奇怪了。美国想逃脱破坏四国首脑会议的罪责，也是绝对办不到的。
