We need...
    With six hundred and fifty million pairs of enthusiastic hands, we extend our assistance to Asia, Africa, and Latin America, where the anti-imperialist struggle is raging like a storm! Brothers, go and seek justice and revenge, erupt like a volcano, cut off the cold currents, and overthrow and crush the imperialist running dogs. Never give up until complete liberation is achieved! We have tasted enough of your suffering, we have risen from the pool of blood, and we are even more spirited as we hold your hands. The sound of our heartbeats reverberates behind you. For the sake of building our happiness, for the sake of your carefree lives, please listen to the voice of great joy: "We need time, we need peace, we need friends!" (Note)
          (Note) Words of Chairman Mao

    我们需要……
    俯拾我们伸出六亿五千万双热手，援助反帝斗争风暴怒卷的亚、非、拉丁美洲……！弟兄们你们去伸冤报仇，你们去爆发火山，斩断寒流，你们去揪翻踏碎帝国主义走狗。得不到彻底解放誓不罢休！你们苦难的味道我们曾经尝够，我们已从血泊里站起来，挽着你们更加精神抖擞，我们心脏的跳声，震响到你们身后。为了建设我们的幸福，为了你们生活的无虑无忧，请听巨大欢悦的声音：“我们需要时间，需要和平，需要朋友！”（注）
          （注）毛主席话
