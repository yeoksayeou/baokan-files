    Your Struggle is Not Isolated!
    Ai Na
    Like a prairie fire, the struggles of oppressed people in Asian countries against imperialism and its running dogs are raging. The just and patriotic struggles of the people of South Korea and Turkey are in full swing; the struggle of the Japanese people against the US-Japan military alliance has reached a new peak. The volcanoes under the feet of US imperialism are erupting one after another like a chain reaction. A few days ago, the Chinese people held mass demonstrations to support the just struggles of the people of South Korea and Turkey. Yesterday, in front of the majestic Tiananmen Square, there was a powerful call to resolutely support the Japanese people's struggle against the US-Japan military alliance. The 650 million Chinese people stand completely on the same front with the Japanese people, the South Korean people, and the Turkish people. Our common enemy is the heinous US imperialism!
    The US and Japanese reactionaries collude with each other and act in collusion. US imperialism attempts to dominate the world, threaten socialist countries, and suppress national independence movements. It wants to use Japan as a base for aggression and use the Japanese people as cannon fodder for aggressive wars; the Kishi Nobusuke government attempts to rely on the power of US imperialism to suppress the patriotic democratic movement of the people at home, and to expand into Southeast Asia, reliving the old dream of the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." The US-Japan military alliance is a serious step by the US and Japanese reactionaries in preparing for a new war of aggression. It not only threatens peace in the Far East and the world, but also threatens the safety of the Japanese people. People remember that during the Korean War, the United States used Japan as a naval and air base and a supply base for the US military, and replenished cannon fodder from Japan. US imperialism wants to realize its conspiracy of "Asians fighting Asians" through the US-Japan military alliance. American generals have more than once openly declared: If a war breaks out, our American children do not have to shed blood, there are Japanese, Germans... to die for the United States.
    The people of Asian countries who have personally suffered from the scourge of Japanese militarist aggression clearly know what the revival of Japanese militarism and the formation of a military alliance between the United States and Japan mean. Japanese militarism was once the executioner of the Asian people. In the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, the Chinese people sacrificed more than 10 million people; in the Pacific War, 2 million people died in Indonesia, 1.1 million people died in the Philippines, and more than 2 million people died in Vietnam. The economic damage caused by the war to these countries, including Japan, is incalculable. Now, the US and Japanese reactionaries are actually trying to force the Japanese people onto the war chariot of the United States, which is of course intolerable to the people of Asian countries, and intolerable to the Japanese people.
    History will not repeat itself. If, in the past, when the strength of the people of various countries was not as strong as it is now, the invincible Japanese imperialism could not escape the fate of its demise, then today's situation is that the East wind prevails over the West wind. With the existence of the powerful Sino-Soviet alliance, under the increasingly strong impact of the anti-imperialist storm of the people of Asian countries, can the conspiracy of the US and Japanese reactionaries succeed?
    Imperialism and all reactionaries have always been the best negative teachers for the people of all countries. The more frantic and brutal imperialism and reactionaries are, the more they arouse strong resistance from the people of all countries. What imperialism considers reliable is always unreliable. The reactionaries of various countries are the abscesses of the people of various countries, but US imperialism regards them as treasures and tries every means to support and control them. Kishi Nobusuke, Syngman Rhee, and Menderes are such treasures. For the overall health, the people of all countries will always remove the abscesses sooner or later. Syngman Rhee has fallen from the throne of twelve years of fascist rule overnight. Menderes is also on the verge of collapse. As the "Akahata" said: "What Syngman Rhee is today is what Kishi Nobusuke will be tomorrow."
    The Japanese people's struggle against the US-Japan military alliance is completely a just struggle, and it will surely be supported by all peace-loving people in the world. Japanese people, your struggle is not isolated. Comrade Mao Zedong said that the storm of the struggle of the oppressed people of Asian countries against imperialism and its running dogs will rise even greater. We believe that as long as everyone unites and persists in the struggle, the storm that is rising even greater will sweep US imperialism and all reactionaries from the earth!

### 你们的斗争不是孤立的！

    你们的斗争不是孤立的！

    像烈火燎原，亚洲各国受压迫人民反对帝国主义及其走狗的斗争正在熊熊燃烧。南朝鲜人民和土耳其人民的正义爱国斗争方兴未艾；日本人民反对美日军事同盟的斗争又达到了新的高峰。美帝国主义脚下的火山像连锁反应似地一个接着一个爆发了。前几天，中国人民刚为支持南朝鲜人民、土耳其人民的正义斗争举行了群众大示威，昨天，在巍峨的天安门前，又响彻了坚决支持日本人民反对美日军事同盟斗争的强大呼声。六亿五千万的中国人民完全和日本人民、南朝鲜人民、土耳其人民站在一条战线上，我们的共同敌人就是穷凶极恶的美国帝国主义！
    美日反动派互相勾结，狼狈为奸。美帝国主义妄图独霸世界，威胁社会主义阵营国家和镇压民族独立运动，要利用日本作为侵略基地，利用日本人民充当侵略战争的炮灰；岸信介政府则妄图依仗美帝国主义势力，镇压国内人民爱国民主运动，并向东南亚地区扩张，重温“大东亚共荣圈”的旧梦。美日军事同盟是美日反动派准备新的侵略战争的一个严重步骤。它不但威胁着远东和世界的和平，也威胁着日本人民的安全。人们都记得，在侵略朝鲜战争中，美国正是利用日本作为美军的海空基地和军需供应基地，并且从日本补充炮灰的。美帝国主义想通过美日军事同盟来实现其“亚洲人打亚洲人”的阴谋。美国将军不止一次公然宣称：假如发动了战争，我们美国人的子弟不必去流血，那里有日本人、德国人……替美国去送死。
    亲身遭受过日本军国主义侵略祸害的亚洲各国人民清楚地知道，日本军国主义复活和美日结成军事同盟意味着什么。日本军国主义曾是亚洲人民的刽子手。在八年抗日战争中，中国人民牺牲了一千万人以上；在太平洋战争中，印度尼西亚人民死亡了二百万人，菲律宾人民死亡了一百一十万人，越南人民死亡了二百余万人，而战争给这些国家包括日本在内在经济上造成的损害，更是无法计算。现在，美日反动派居然又要强把日本人民缚在美国的战车上，这当然使亚洲各国人民不能容忍，日本人民也不能容忍。
    历史不会重演。如果说在当年各国人民力量还不如现在强大的情况下，不可一世的日本帝国主义尚不能免于复亡的命运，那么，今天的形势是东风压倒着西风，在强大的中苏同盟存在之下，在亚洲各国人民反帝风暴日益强烈的冲击之下，美日反动派的阴谋能够得逞吗？
    帝国主义和一切反动派，从来是各国人民最好的反面教员。帝国主义和反动派愈是疯狂、残暴，就愈是激起各国人民强烈的反抗。帝国主义认为可靠的总是不可靠的。各国反动派是各国人民的脓疱，美帝国主义却把他们当作宝贝，千方百计地加以扶植和控制。岸信介、李承晚和曼德列斯之流就是这种宝贝。各国人民为了整体的健康，总是迟早会把脓疱剜掉的。李承晚已经在一夜之间从十二年法西斯统治的宝座上跌下来。曼德列斯也已朝不保夕。正如“赤旗报”所说：“李承晚的今天，就是岸信介的明天”。
    日本人民反对美日军事同盟的斗争，完全是正义的斗争，它一定得到全世界一切爱好和平人民的支持。日本人民，你们的斗争不是孤立的。毛泽东同志说过，亚洲各国受压迫人民反对帝国主义及其走狗的斗争风暴将会有更大的兴起。我们相信，只要大家团结一致，坚持斗争，正在更大地兴起的风暴将会把美帝国主义和一切反动派从地球上刮掉！
