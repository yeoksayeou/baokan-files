Xinhua News Agency Report: Recent new achievements in the technical revolution and cultural revolution in Shanghai, Fujian, Qinghai, and Wuhan - A Group of Advanced Workers Promoted to Engineers

    Xinhua News Agency: The Shanghai Municipal People's Committee recently selected 138 outstanding workers to be engineers.

    This is the first time Shanghai has promoted a large number of engineers from among workers. They have high political awareness, are highly motivated, and have made great contributions to the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. They are the most outstanding members of the advanced workers. Among them, Wang Linhe, a young worker at the Huguang Scientific Instrument Factory, after successfully trial-producing the advanced product of a 10,000-volt high-voltage bridge, has recently produced a 50,000-volt high-voltage bridge. Others promoted to engineers this time include Li Fuxiang, a young worker who manufactured and improved 16 kinds of advanced drill bits; Wang Wanrong, an old worker who has continuously innovated 12 different types of milling cutters; Bao Xudong, an old worker who created the double-set extractor, an important piece of equipment for the pharmaceutical industry; Wang Nengxing, a steelmaking expert who boldly innovated technology to bring backward electric furnaces into the national advanced ranks; and Li Haipeng, a postal worker who was the first to make an automatic stamp vending machine.

    Many of the outstanding workers promoted to engineers this time are veteran workers with ten or twenty years of work experience. In the early days of liberation, most of them were illiterate or semi-illiterate. Under the education of the Party, and through diligent study, they are now studying in secondary or higher-level spare-time schools. Many people are studying in technical training schools run by industrial departments. Wang Linhe, who is studying at a spare-time university, can now read technical books in two foreign languages. Shou Kuifu, who was a sweeper at the time of liberation, is now also studying Russian and other courses at a spare-time university.

    This newspaper reports: Fujian Province's Department of Water and Electricity, Department of Light Industry, and other eight departments and bureaus, as well as Fuzhou City, recently promoted 181 workers and technicians to engineers and assistant engineers.

    This group of newly promoted engineers are vanguards in technical innovation. Xu Zi'an, an engineer from Fuzhou Paper Mill, who started as a worker, worked day and night with young workers to study technology in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. He created a local process pipeline, reduced pulp consumption, and improved quality, creating more than 2 million yuan of wealth for the country.

    This group of new engineers not only has rich production experience, but also, under the leadership of the Party, and through long-term diligent study, their political, cultural, and scientific and technical theoretical levels have been rapidly improved. They not only study diligently and constantly improve themselves, but also train a large number of technical personnel for the Party, unreservedly passing on their valuable experience to their apprentices. For example, Wu Tiemang, a new engineer from Fujian Agricultural Machinery Factory, has trained nearly 100 apprentices in recent years. He carefully guides young apprentices. Since 1959, under his guidance, 30 apprentices have been able to operate independently, and more than 20 apprentices have achieved more than 80 technical innovations, creating a lot of wealth for the country.

    Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 12th: With the deepening of the Great Leap Forward in production and the technical revolution and cultural revolution, the cultural, scientific, and technical levels of the broad masses of workers in Qinghai Province have rapidly improved, and a large number of cadres from worker backgrounds have emerged. According to statistics, there are currently more than 3,690 production leading cadres and engineering technical cadres in the province who have been promoted from among workers. Among them, 16 people have recently been hired as specially invited researchers by the Qinghai Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

    These production leading cadres and engineering technical cadres from worker backgrounds are all activists who have emerged in previous political movements, production movements, and the current technical innovation and technical revolution movement. They are loyal to the cause of the Party, work diligently, have a communist style of daring to think and act, can closely connect with the masses, and have rich practical production experience and certain scientific and cultural knowledge. Among them, there are more than 1,500 Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members, and more than 300 advanced producers and advanced workers. After being promoted to new positions, they can quickly become familiar with and be competent for new work tasks. He Mingxi, an engineer recently promoted from a worker by the Well Construction Company of the Qinghai Provincial Bureau of Fuel Industry, has always stood at the forefront of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, and has worked hard with the masses to study and has jointly achieved 22 major innovation projects.

    Party organizations at all levels in Qinghai Province have adopted a method that combines training in practical work with running various types of spare-time schools, relying on their own efforts to vigorously train technical cadres from among workers.

    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 12th: Since the beginning of this year, factories and mining enterprises in Wuhan City have promoted more than 500 outstanding workers to engineering and technical cadres.

    The vast majority of these engineering and technical cadres from worker backgrounds are veteran workers. They have a high degree of political awareness and rich production experience, are highly motivated and eager to learn, can closely connect with the masses, and have made outstanding achievements in production and construction. Shuai Wenhua, a newly promoted engineer from Wugang, was originally an eighth-grade welder. He has superb welding skills and has mastered the technology of producing welding rods through diligent study. Based on the urgent needs of Wugang's construction, he started making equipment and built a factory for producing welding rods from scratch last year. In this year's technical revolution movement, he gradually realized the mechanization and semi-mechanization of local equipment and manual operation, and later further developed it into mechanization and semi-automation. The annual production capacity of welding rods reached more than 300 tons, an increase of nearly seven times compared to the beginning, while the number of personnel was reduced from more than 30 to 16. Shuai Wenhua has provided overall leadership to the factory, leading well in everything from equipment manufacturing, product design, and production technology to conducting political and ideological work for workers.

    This group of newly promoted engineering and technical cadres did not have the opportunity to study before liberation, and many of them were originally illiterate. After liberation, they actively participated in learning in their spare time, and their political, technical, and cultural levels have improved rapidly.

    上海福建青海武汉技术革命文化革命的新果实
    一批先进工人被提拔为工程师
    据新华社讯　最近上海市人民委员会选拔了一百三十八名优秀工人为工程师。
    这是上海市第一次从工人中大批提拔工程师。他们政治觉悟高，干劲足，在技术革新和技术革命运动中贡献很大，是先进工人中最优秀的分子。其中，沪光科学仪器厂青年工人王林鹤在试制成功尖端产品一万伏高压电桥以后，最近又制成了五万伏高压电桥。这次提拔为工程师的，还有制造改进了十六种先进钻头的青年工人李福祥，连续革新了十二种不同类型铣刀的老工人王万荣，创造了医药工业上的重要设备双套式提取器的老工人鲍序栋，有大胆革新技术使落后电炉跨进全国先进行列的炼钢能手王能兴，第一个制成自动售邮票机的邮递员李海鹏等。
    这次被提拔为工程师的优秀工人中，有许多是具有十年、二十年以上工龄的老工人。他们在解放初期大多数是文盲、半文盲、在党的教育下，经过刻苦学习，现在都在中等以上业余学校学习，许多人正在工业部门举办的技术进修学校学习。在业余大学学习的王林鹤，现在已能阅读两种外国文字的技术书籍。解放时是扫地工的寿奎富，现在也在业余大学学习俄文等课程。
    本报讯　福建省水电厅、轻工业厅等八个厅局和福州市，最近提拔了一百八十一名工人和技术员为工程师和助理工程师。
    这批新提拔的工程师是技术革新的闯将。福州造纸厂工人出身的工程师许子安，在技术革新和技术革命运动中，夜以继日地和青年工人一起钻研技术，创造了土流程管道化，降低浆耗，提高质量，为国家创造了二百多万元的财富。
    这批新工程师，不但有丰富的生产经验，而且在党的领导下，经过长期的勤学苦练，政治文化和科学技术理论水平得到迅速提高。他们不但自己勤学苦练，不断提高自己，同时还为党培养了大批技术人员，毫无保留地把自己的宝贵经验传授给自己的学徒。如福建农械厂新工程师吴铁忙，几年来带了近百名学徒，他认真指导青年学徒。从1959年以来，在他指导下，就有三十名学徒能独立操作，二十多名学徒实现了八十多项技术革新，为国家创造了许多财富。
  据新华社西宁12日电　随着生产大跃进和技术革命文化革命的深入开展，青海省广大工人的文化科学技术水平迅速提高，涌现出了大批工人出身的干部。据统计，目前全省有三千六百九十多名生产领导干部和工程技术干部是从工人当中提拔的。其中有十六人在最近被中国科学院青海分院聘请为特约研究员。
    这些工人出身的生产领导干部和工程技术干部，都是在历次政治运动、生产运动以及当前技术革新和技术革命运动中涌现出来的积极分子。他们对党的事业忠心耿耿，工作勤勤恳恳，具有敢想敢干的共产主义风格，能密切联系群众，并有丰富的生产实践经验和一定的科学文化知识。其中，共产党员和共青团员有一千五百多名，先进生产者和先进工作者有三百多名。他们在被提拔到新的工作岗位以后，都能很快地熟悉和胜任新的工作任务。青海省燃料工业局建井公司新近由工人提拔的工程师贺明玺，始终站在技术革新和技术革命运动的最前列，同群众一起苦心钻研，共实现了二十二项重大革新项目。
    青海省各级党组织采取在实际工作中锻炼和大办各类业余学校相结合的办法，自力更生，大力从工人中培养技术干部。
    据新华社武汉12日电　武汉市各厂矿企业今年以来提拔了五百多名优秀工人为工程技术干部。
    这些工人出身的工程技术干部绝大部分是老工人，他们有较高的政治觉悟和丰富的生产经验，干劲大，钻劲足，能密切联系群众，在生产建设中作出了优异的成绩。武钢新提拔的工程师帅文华，原来是个八级电焊工。他电焊技艺高超，并通过勤钻苦学掌握了生产电焊条的技术。他根据武钢建设的迫切需要，从去年开始自制设备，白手起家，办起了生产电焊条的工厂。在今年技术革命运动中，他将土设备和手工操作逐步实现了机械化、半机械化，后来又进一步发展为机械化、半自动化，年产焊条能力达到三百多吨，比开始时增长了将近七倍，而人员由三十多人减少到十六人。帅文华对这个厂进行了全盘领导，从设备制造、产品设计、生产工艺一直到对工人作政治思想工作，都领导得很好。
    这批新提拔的工程技术干部，解放前没有读书的机会，有不少人原来是文盲。解放后，他们利用业余时间积极参加学习，政治、技术、文化水平都提高得很快。
