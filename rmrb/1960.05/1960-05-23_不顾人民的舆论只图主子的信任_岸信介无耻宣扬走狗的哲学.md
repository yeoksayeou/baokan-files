Xinhua News Agency, May 22nd. According to a report in the "Yomiuri Shimbun" on the evening of the 21st, Japanese traitorous Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke openly challenged Japanese public opinion today, saying arrogantly that he is not afraid of public opinion, "As time passes, people will forget everything."

According to this newspaper, Kishi Nobusuke made this remark when talking about the unanimous opposition across the country to his use of fascist violence to illegally force the House of Representatives to "pass" the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty.

Kishi Nobusuke made these remarks while talking with Oono Banboku, the vice president of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.

According to reports, Kishi Nobusuke, this American running dog, also said: "If the new treaty is not ratified, Japan's friends will lose trust in Japan, and Japan will be subjected to external military threats. Therefore, I firmly believe that my political path is just and correct."

According to the "Yomiuri Shimbun," Kishi Nobusuke even said shamelessly, "Thanks to God, I smoothly enabled the House of Representatives to approve the motion to extend the Diet session and the treaty itself."

    不顾人民的舆论只图主子的信任
    岸信介无耻宣扬走狗的哲学
    新华社22日讯　据“读卖新闻”21日晚上报道，日本卖国首相岸信介今天公然向日本舆论挑战，嚣张地说，他不怕舆论，“时间一过，人们将把一切都忘掉。”
    据这家报纸说，岸信介是在谈到他用法西斯暴力非法强使众议院“通过”日美军事同盟条约而遭到举国一致的反对时讲这番话的。
    岸信介是在同执政的自由民主党副总裁大野伴睦谈话时这样说的。
    据报道，岸信介这个美国走狗还说：“如果不批准新条约，日本的朋友们将对日本失掉信任，日本将受到外来的军事威胁。因此，我深信，我的政治道路是正义和正确的。”
    据“读卖新闻”说，岸信介甚至厚颜无耻地说，“托天之福，我顺利地使众议院批准了关于延长国会会期的动议和条约本身。”
