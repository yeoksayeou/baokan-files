Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, 12th: Fushun, the coal capital that once suffered long-term oppression by the Japanese invaders, transformed into a city of anger today. Four hundred thousand coal miners and people from all walks of life held an unprecedented large-scale demonstration, supporting the Japanese people's just struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty and opposing the crimes of the Japanese and U.S. reactionaries in persecuting and suppressing the Japanese Miike coal mine worker brothers. Fushun miners unanimously expressed their determination to be the backing of the Miike miners who stand at the forefront of the struggle.

Fushun miners still clearly remember the brutal massacres they suffered during the bloody rule of Japanese militarism fifteen years ago. They had sent a telegram to the Japanese Miike Coal Mine Workers' Union on April 6, which suffered brutal suppression by the Japanese and U.S. reactionary forces, expressing firm support for the just struggle of the Miike miners. At dawn today, countless miners and citizens, holding high the banners of "Oppose the Japanese and U.S. Reactionaries' Conspiracy to Plan a New War" and "Support the Struggle of the Japanese Miike Miners," gathered in the city center square to hold a mass rally to support the Japanese people's struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. The masses participating in the demonstration and rally crowded the five roads connecting the city center square. The miner militias armed with weapons seized from the Japanese invaders and the miner teams from the six major coal mines stood at the forefront of the crowd. Old miners Xia Tingze and Li Lianggui, who survived the Pingdingshan massacre of three thousand people by Japanese fascists in 1932, as well as old miners from the Hutaigou and Longfeng mines who had waged heroic struggles against the Japanese invaders, stood at the front of the demonstration, raising their fists and leading the masses in chanting slogans such as "Oppose the Revival of Japanese Militarism" and "Support the Struggle of the Japanese Miike Miners!"

At 9 a.m., the conference began in a solemn atmosphere. Shen Yue, First Secretary of the Fushun Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke first. He solemnly announced that the 1.5 million people of the coal capital Fushun resolutely support the patriotic and just struggle of the Japanese people and resolutely support the heroic and unyielding struggle of the Japanese Miike coal miners against persecution. He also expressed his sincere respect to the Miike coal miners who persevered in the struggle, regardless of the dangers and the suppression by the Kishi Nobusuke government and the monopoly capital groups, and warmly praised the great role they played in the Japanese people's anti-imperialist and patriotic struggle, and severely condemned the fascist atrocities of the Japanese reactionary forces in persecuting and killing workers.

Shen Yue said that the people of Fushun will never forget the inhumane atrocities of Japanese militarism in Northeast China. He said: "The Fushun workers and the people of the city who suffered fourteen years of bloody rule by Japanese militarism will never allow Japanese militarism to revive." He also expressed his firm belief that the Japanese people, with the support of the people of the world and the support of the 650 million Chinese people, will be able to completely smash the aggressive military alliance of the Japanese and U.S. reactionaries and finally drive the forces of U.S. imperialism out of Japan completely. His speech constantly aroused warm applause from the 400,000 masses. The slogan "The people of China and Japan unite, the people of the world unite, and overthrow U.S. imperialism!" resounded for a long time.

Zhao Jian, Vice Chairman of the Fushun Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, then spoke, pointing out that the struggle of the Japanese Miike miners is not isolated, and the anti-American patriotic struggle of the Japanese people is even less isolated. He said: "The people of Fushun who suffered fourteen years of bloody rule by Japanese militarism, like the people of the whole country, firmly stand with the Japanese people."

Kiichi Kinoshita, a representative of the delegation of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan visiting China, took the stage to speak amidst warm applause from the audience. He indignantly exposed to the people of Fushun the crimes of the Kishi Nobusuke government and the Japanese monopoly capital groups in using all power and violence to concentrate their attacks on the Miike miners who stand at the forefront of the anti-American patriotic struggle. He said, "No matter what form of attack the enemy takes, the long-term and strong fighting system of the Miike workers has not collapsed. Therefore, the vicious enemies used violent groups to break through the workers' defensive lines, injuring hundreds of comrades. On March 29, our comrade Kubo Kiyoshi was tragically sacrificed by the enemy's murderous blade." He said: We must cross the bodies of our comrades and resolutely carry out the struggle. We have sworn an oath: we must use the victory of the struggle to avenge our dead comrades. At this time, the emotions of more than 400,000 people in the audience were high, and they shouted with the Japanese friends: "U.S. imperialism get out of Asia!" "The people of China and Japan unite to overthrow U.S. imperialism!"

The 400,000 people who participated in the conference unanimously passed a telegram supporting the Miike Coal Mine workers in Omuta City, Kyushu, Japan.

Today, also attending the conference were experts from the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and the German Democratic Republic in Fushun, as well as Vietnamese students.

After the conference, 400,000 people held demonstrations in five routes. The masses participating in the demonstration sang songs such as "Unity is Strength" and "Oppose Arming Japan." Many old workers who had suffered persecution by Japanese fascists and who had waged heroic struggles against the Japanese invaders, in the ranks, accused the Japanese bandits of mass killings of workers in Fushun coal mines and the crimes of creating "pits of ten thousand people." Literary and art groups performed street plays depicting the ugly faces of the war criminal Kishi Nobusuke and living newspapers exposing the conspiracy of the Japanese and U.S. reactionaries to plan a new war. An old man from Pingdingshan who escaped from the bullets of the Japanese fascists angrily pointed to "Kishi Nobusuke" and "American war-mongers" in the living newspaper and said: "You don't have many days left!" Wherever the demonstration team went, they and the masses there shouted together: "Resolutely oppose the revival of Japanese militarism!" and other slogans. The demonstration lasted until the afternoon.

Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 12th: One hundred and fifty thousand people from all ethnic groups and all walks of life in Xining City, Qinghai Province, held a rally and demonstration this afternoon, resolutely supporting the Japanese people's just struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. A strong demonstration team composed of workers, farmers, cadres, students, citizens, and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, holding up signs, gathered at the "May 1st" Club Square. People shouted all the way: "Down with the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty!" "Oppose the revival of Japanese militarism!" "U.S. imperialism get out of Japan!"

After the conference began, Liu Zexi, Standing Committee Member of the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and First Secretary of the Xining Municipal Committee, spoke first. On behalf of the people of all ethnic groups and all walks of life in Qinghai Province, he expressed resolute support for the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle and expressed his lofty respect for the Japanese people who unswervingly persisted in the struggle. He pointed out: The signing of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty seriously threatens peace in Asia and the world. He said that if U.S. imperialism and Japanese militarism dare to risk the world's condemnation and launch a war of aggression, it will only accelerate their own destruction.

Sangre Gyatso, a member of the Qinghai Provincial Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, heads of the provincial and municipal local organizations of various democratic parties and various people's organizations, as well as representatives of workers, farmers, students, and members of urban people's communes, also spoke at the meeting one after another, angrily condemning U.S. imperialism for fostering Japanese militarism and threatening peace in Asia and the world, and expressed their firm support for the Japanese people's just struggle.

The conference finally passed a telegram. After the meeting, the 150,000 people who participated in the conference held a massive demonstration.

    坚决和日本人民站在一起
    抚顺西宁人民举行声势浩大的示威游行
    新华社抚顺12日电　曾经遭受日寇长期压榨的煤都抚顺，今天变成了一座愤怒的城。煤矿工人和各界人民有四十万人举行空前规模的大示威，支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的正义斗争，并且反对日美反动派迫害与镇压日本三池煤矿工人弟兄的罪行。抚顺矿工一致表示要做站在斗争前列的三池矿工的后盾。
    抚顺矿工至今还清楚记得十五年前日本军国主义血腥统治时期所受到的野蛮屠杀。他们曾在4月6日向遭受日美反动势力野蛮镇压的日本三池煤矿工会拍发电报，表示坚决支持三池矿工的正义斗争。今天拂晓，数不清的矿工和市民又高举“反对日美反动派策划新战争的阴谋”“支持日本三池矿工的斗争”的旗帜，聚集在市中心广场举行了支援日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约斗争的群众大会，参加示威和集会的群众挤满了连接市中心广场的五条马路。用缴获日寇的武器武装起来的矿工民兵和六大煤矿的矿工队伍站在人流的最前列。在1932年日本法西斯制造的平顶山三千人大惨案中死里逃生的老矿工夏廷泽、李连贵以及与日本侵略者进行过英勇斗争的老虎台矿、龙凤矿的老矿工都站在示威队伍的前头，他们高举拳头，领导群众高呼“反对复活日本军国主义”“支援日本三池矿工的斗争！”等口号。
    上午九时，大会在严肃的气氛中开始。中共抚顺市委第一书记沈越首先讲话，他庄严宣布：煤都抚顺一百五十万人民坚决支援日本人民的爱国正义斗争，坚决支援日本三池煤矿工人英勇不屈的反迫害斗争。他还对不畏艰险、不顾岸信介政府和垄断资本集团的镇压，坚持斗争的三池煤矿工人表示衷心的敬意，对他们在日本人民反帝爱国斗争中所发挥的巨大作用表示热烈赞扬，并且严厉谴责了日本反动势力迫害工人、残杀工人的法西斯暴行。
    沈越说，抚顺人民永远也不会忘记日本军国主义在东北的惨无人道的暴行。他说：“受到日本军国主义十四年血腥统治的抚顺工人和全市人民，决不允许日本军国主义复活。”他还表示坚信日本人民在全世界人民的支持下，在六亿五千万中国人民的支持下，一定能够彻底粉碎日美反动派的侵略性军事同盟，最后把美帝国主义势力，彻底地从日本驱逐出去。他的讲话不断激起四十万群众的热烈掌声，“中日两国人民团结起来，全世界人民团结起来，打倒美帝国主义！”的口号声经久不息。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会抚顺分会副主席赵健接着讲话，他指出，日本三池矿工的斗争不是孤立的，日本人民的反美爱国斗争更不是孤立的。他说：“曾经遭受日本军国主义十四年血腥统治的抚顺人民和全国人民一样，坚决和日本人民站在一起”。
    日本工会总评议会访华代表团代表木下行一在全场热烈的掌声中登台讲话。他十分愤慨地向抚顺人民揭露了岸信介政府和日本垄断资本集团施用一切权力和暴力，集中攻击站在反美爱国斗争最前列的三池矿工的罪行。他说“无论敌人采取什么样的攻击形式，三池工人长期而坚强的斗争体制没有瓦解。因此，穷凶恶极的敌人就用暴力团体突破工人的防御线，打伤了数百名同志。3月29日，我们的久保清同志，就是惨遭敌人凶刃的刺杀而牺牲了。”他说：我们一定越过同志的尸体，坚决地进行斗争。我们已经宣誓：一定要用斗争的胜利来为死去的同志报仇。这时全场四十多万人情绪激昂，他们与日本朋友们一起高呼：“美帝国主义从亚洲滚出去！”“中日两国人民团结起来，打倒美帝国主义！”
    参加大会的四十万人一致通过了支援日本九州大牟田市三池煤矿工人的通电。
    今天，参加大会的还有在抚顺的苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国的专家和越南留学生等。
    大会结束以后，四十万群众分五路举行游行示威。参加示威的群众高唱“团结就是力量”、“反对武装日本”等歌曲。许多遭受过日本法西斯迫害的和与日本侵略者进行过英勇斗争的老工人，在队伍里向群众控诉了日本强盗在抚顺煤矿成批枪杀工人和制造“万人坑”的罪行，各文艺团体在街头演出了描绘岸信介战争贩子丑恶嘴脸的街头剧和揭露日美反动派策划新战争阴谋的活报剧。来自平顶山从日本法西斯枪弹下逃生出来的老人气愤地指着活报剧里的“岸信介”和“美国战争贩子”说：“你们没有几天日子过了！”游行队伍走到那里，就与那里的群众一起高呼：“坚决反对复活日本军国主义！”等口号。示威游行一直持续到下午。
