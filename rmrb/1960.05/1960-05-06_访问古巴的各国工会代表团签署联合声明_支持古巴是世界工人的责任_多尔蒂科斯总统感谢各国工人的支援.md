Xinhua News Agency, Havana, May 4th: Trade union delegations from various countries that participated in the "May Day" International Labor Day celebrations in Cuba today signed a joint statement entitled "Defend the Cuban Revolution." The full text of the statement is as follows:

"We, the delegations from many countries, were invited by the Cuban Workers' Confederation to participate in the celebrations of 'May Day' in Havana. We had the opportunity to witness the extremely grand demonstration celebrating International Labor Day. This parade showed the close unity between the workers, the people, the revolutionary government, and its program.

We, the foreign trade union delegations who came here, have personally witnessed the profound changes that are taking place in the economic, social, and political spheres. In our direct contact with workers and the people, we felt the atmosphere of trade union freedom and democracy, and felt the government has the broadest support for the revolutionary goals.

We, the foreign trade union delegations, would like to express our most heartfelt gratitude to the Cuban Workers' Confederation for giving us the opportunity to visit this beautiful country, thereby strengthening friendly ties and mutual support among workers.

Trade union delegations from various countries, following the principles of international worker mutual support, believe that it is an unshirkable responsibility to most resolutely support the struggle of the Cuban working class and people against any infringement upon their independence and sovereignty. Because we recognize that all people in the world have the right to freely arrange their destiny and choose the government that best suits their interests.

On the basis of the universal principles of people's self-determination, political and economic independence, and freedom of trade, we support the goals of the Cuban Workers' Confederation workers and their government. Therefore, we strongly and firmly condemn any attempt to economically boycott or blockade the Cuban people who are struggling to continuously improve their living standards and improve their working conditions.

We, the foreign trade union delegations, see that the Cuban Revolution has the profound content of opposing the interests of imperialist monopoly organizations. It implements land reform, nationalizes some enterprises, lowers electricity and rents, etc.; those forces that have been harmed are today doing everything possible—from open military threats to economic sabotage and boycotts—to create various difficulties in order to hinder the consolidation of the Cuban Revolution.

Therefore, we believe that no worker in the world should be indifferent to these actions and threats of imperialism, and certainly should not contribute to such sinister goals, but rather, on the contrary, should express their fullest support for the Cuban workers, people, and government. In this sense, we are convinced that American workers will never agree to get involved in any boycott or sabotage activities against their Cuban worker brothers.

The organizations that signed this statement guarantee to carry out various support activities and widely publicize the reality of Cuba in order to smash the deceptive and slanderous propaganda carried out internationally against the Cuban people and the revolutionary government.

The organizations that signed this statement call on all workers, all patriots, and especially all trade union organizations around the world, to treat this statement as their own."

The following 29 trade union organizations and representatives of Spanish workers from countries and regions such as Argentina, Chile, Venezuela, Uruguay, Ecuador, Brazil, Mexico, Trinidad and Tobago, the Soviet Union, China, Poland, the German Democratic Republic, and the Federation of Mali signed this statement.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, May 4th: Cuban President Dorticos received the trade union delegations from various countries participating in the "May Day" International Labor Day celebrations in Cuba this afternoon. The delegations presented President Dorticos with the statement they signed today in support of the Cuban Revolution.

Luis Figueroa, Secretary General of the Chilean Unified Workers' Confederation, emphasized on behalf of the trade union delegations from various countries that this statement expressed the position of representatives from trade union organizations on all continents with various different thoughts, beliefs, and skin colors. He pointed out that the Cuban Revolution, which has won the enthusiastic support of people from all countries, has broken the links of the colonial system chain in Latin America, and all the links of this chain will also completely collapse.

Dorticos thanked the trade union delegations from various countries for their support of Cuba. He said: "We believe that this struggle launched by the Cuban Revolution against a powerful enemy will be victorious because we have the vitality of the Cuban people and the support of people from all countries in the world." He said that Cuba knows how to fulfill its guarantee to the people of all countries, and the people of all countries will help it do so.

Dorticos condemned the U.S.’s planned announcement of a boycott of Cuba by U.S. ports as a "new conspiracy against our homeland and our revolution." Dorticos expressed his belief that American workers, loyal to the interests of the proletariat, will not serve as tools to realize this conspiracy.

    访问古巴的各国工会代表团签署联合声明
    支持古巴是世界工人的责任
    多尔蒂科斯总统感谢各国工人的支援
    新华社哈瓦那4日电　在古巴参加了庆祝“五一”国际劳动节活动的各国工会代表团今天签署了一项题为“保卫古巴革命”的联合声明。声明全文如下：
    “我们许多国家的代表团应古巴工人联合会的邀请在哈瓦那参加了‘五一’的庆祝活动，我们有机会看到了极为盛大的庆祝国际劳动节的示威游行，这个游行显示了工人、人民同革命政府及其纲领的紧密无间的团结。
    我们来到此地的外国工会代表团亲眼看到了在经济、社会和政治方面正在发生的深刻变化。我们在同工人和人民的直接接触中，感到了工会自由和民主的气氛，感到政府得到对革命目标的最广泛的支持。
    我们外国工会代表团谨向古巴工人联合会表示我们最衷心的感谢，感谢它使我们有机会访问这个美丽的国家，从而密切和加强了友好联系和工人之间的相互支援。
    遵循国际工人相互支援原则的各国工会代表团认为，最坚决地支持古巴工人阶级和人民反对任何侵害他们的独立和主权的斗争，是义不容辞的责任。因为我们认识到，世界各国人民都有权自由安排他们的命运和选择最符合他们利益的政府。
    在人民自决、政治和经济独立以及贸易自由的普遍原则的基础上，我们支持古巴工人联合会的工人和他们的政府的目标。因此，我们强烈和坚决地谴责在经济上抵制或封锁为不断提高自己的生活水平和改善他们的劳动条件而斗争的古巴人民的任何企图。
    我们外国工会代表团看到，古巴革命具有反对帝国主义大垄断组织利益的深刻内容，它实行土地改革，把一些企业收归国有，降低电费和房租等等；那些受到损害的势力今天想尽各种办法——从公开的军事威胁到经济上的破坏和抵制——制造各种困难，以便阻挠古巴革命的巩固。
    因此，我们认为，世界上的任何工人都不应该对帝国主义的这些行动和威胁漠不关心，当然更不应该为这种罪恶的目的出力，而是恰恰相反，应该表示他们对古巴工人、人民和政府的最充分的支援。在这个意义上，我们确信，美国工人决不会答应卷入反对他们的古巴工人弟兄的任何抵制或破坏活动。
    签署这项声明的组织保证进行各种支援活动，广泛宣传古巴的现实情况，以便粉碎在国际范围内进行的反对古巴人民和革命政府的欺骗和诽谤宣传。
    签署这个声明的组织号召全世界所有的工人、所有的爱国者，特别是各个工会组织，把这项声明当作他们自己的声明。”
    签署这项声明的有阿根廷、智利、委内瑞拉、乌拉圭、厄瓜多尔、巴西、墨西哥、特立尼达和多巴哥、苏联、中国、波兰、德意志民主共和国、马里联邦等国家和地区的二十九个工会组织和西班牙工人的代表。
    新华社哈瓦那4日电　古巴总统多尔蒂科斯今天下午接见了在古巴参加“五一”国际劳动节庆祝活动的各国工会代表团。各国代表团把它们在今天签署的支持古巴革命的声明交给多尔蒂科斯总统。
    智利工人统一工会总书记路易斯·菲格罗亚以各国工会代表团的名义强调指出，这项声明表达了各洲工会组织的具有各种不同思想、信仰和肤色的代表们的立场。他指出，博得各国人民热烈支持的古巴革命打断了殖民制度锁链在拉丁美洲的环节，这条锁链的所有环节也将全部崩溃。
    多尔蒂科斯感谢各国工会代表团对古巴的支持。他说：“我们相信，古巴革命所展开的这个反对强大敌人的斗争将获得胜利，因为我们拥有古巴人民的活力和世界各国人民的支援。”他说，古巴知道如何去履行它向各国人民提出的保证，各国人民将帮助它这样做。
    多尔蒂科斯谴责美国正在策划的宣布美国港口抵制古巴的做法，是一个“反对我们祖国和我们革命的新阴谋”。多尔蒂科斯表示相信，忠于无产阶级利益的美国工人不会充当实现这种阴谋的工具。
