    More than one million people from all walks of life in the capital solemnly gathered today to oppose the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty and support the Japanese people's 16th National Unified Action against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. We express our heartfelt support and high respect for the Japanese people's persistent and unyielding struggle.
    U.S. imperialism, at the instigation of the reactionary Nobusuke Kishi government, disregarded the strong opposition of the Japanese people and the people of the world, and used all kinds of despicable means to impatiently pass the aggressive military alliance treaty, the spearhead of which is directed against the people of China, the Soviet Union, Korea, Vietnam, and Asian countries. Its purpose is to legitimize the long-term occupation of Japan by U.S. imperialism and the revival of Japanese militarism, turn Japan into a source of aggressive war in Asia, thereby dragging the Japanese people into the abyss of aggressive war again, and realize the U.S. plan of making Asians fight Asians and the expansionist ambitions of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries. The passage of this treaty will inevitably aggravate the threat to peace in Asia and the world.
    We Chinese people are pleased to see that after the Japanese people have achieved continuous victories in the struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, they have now launched a magnificent 16th National Unified Action to resolutely oppose the Kishi Nobusuke clique's forcible approval of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty in the Japanese Diet. This action once again demonstrates the Japanese people's firm will and powerful strength to oppose U.S. imperialism, oppose the Japan-U.S. military alliance, and demand to take the road of independence, peace, democracy, and neutrality. Of course, the Japanese people's struggle is arduous and even protracted, but we firmly believe that with the support of the people of the world, as long as they persist in the struggle with redoubled efforts, the Japanese people will surely achieve the final victory.
    The Chinese people have always supported the Japanese people's anti-U.S. patriotic and just struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance, and regard this struggle of the Japanese people as our own struggle. U.S. imperialism and Japanese militarism are the common enemies of the Chinese and Japanese people. The people of China and Japan must unite and fight to the end to shatter the conspiracy of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries to jointly create a new war and defend peace in Asia and the world.

    大会通电
    首都各界一百多万人民，今天隆重集会，反对日美军事同盟条约，支援日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约第十六次全国统一行动。我们对于日本人民再接再厉、不屈不挠的斗争，表示衷心的支持和崇高的敬意。
    美帝国主义指使反动的岸信介政府，不顾日本人民和世界人民的强烈反对，用尽各种卑鄙手段迫不及待地要通过矛头指向中国、苏联、朝鲜、越南和亚洲各国人民的侵略性军事同盟条约，其目的是要使美帝国主义长期占领日本和复活日本军国主义合法化，把日本变成亚洲的侵略战争策源地，从而把日本人民再次拖入侵略战争的火坑，实现美国以亚洲人打亚洲人的罪恶计划和美日反动派的扩张野心。这一条约的通过必将加重对亚洲和世界和平的威胁。
    我们中国人民高兴地看到，日本人民在反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争取得了不断的胜利之后，现在又展开了波澜壮阔的第十六次全国统一行动，坚决反对岸信介集团在日本国会强行批准日美军事同盟条约。这一行动再一次显示出日本人民反对美帝国主义、反对日美军事同盟和要求走独立、和平、民主、中立道路的坚强意志和强大威力。诚然，日本人民的斗争是艰苦的甚至是长期的，但是，我们坚信，在全世界人民的支持下，只要再接再厉坚持斗争，日本人民必定能取得最后的胜利。
    中国人民一贯支持日本人民的反对日美军事同盟的反美爱国正义斗争，并且把日本人民的这一斗争看作是我们自己的斗争。美帝国主义和日本军国主义是中国人民和日本人民的共同敌人。中日两国人民联合起来，为粉碎美日反动派共同勾结制造新战争的阴谋，保卫亚洲和世界和平而共同斗争到底。首都各界人民支援日本人
