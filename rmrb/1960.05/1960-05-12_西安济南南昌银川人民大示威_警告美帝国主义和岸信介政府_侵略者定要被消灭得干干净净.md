Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 11th - Two hundred and fifty thousand people from all walks of life in Xi'an City held a rally and demonstration this afternoon in the pouring rain, resolutely supporting the Japanese people's just struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.

From early morning, Xi'an City was experiencing heavy rain. However, mass formations composed of workers, farmers, students, militiamen, and People's Liberation Army soldiers began to surge onto the streets from noon. They held aloft various placards and large-scale cartoons, braving the rain, constantly waving their fists and flags, and shouting slogans. The shouts of hundreds of thousands of people resounded through the sky, drowning out the intermittent sounds of wind and rain.

The main venue of the rally was set in Xincheng Square. The entire Xincheng Square and the surrounding Nanxin Street, Dongxi Xincheng Street, Jiefang Road, Zhongshan Avenue, and Beida Street were filled with people. The roars of the people rose and fell, forming an ocean of anger.

Party and government leaders of Shaanxi Province and Xi'an City participated in the rally. Also participating were the heads of Soviet, German Democratic Republic, and Hungarian experts in Xi'an, as well as Vietnamese students.

Zhang Ce, Secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, spoke at the meeting. On behalf of the 18 million people of the province, he expressed firm support for the Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and paid high tribute to the Japanese people's indomitable and heroic fighting spirit. He pointed out that the heroic struggle of the Japanese people has disrupted the steps of U.S. imperialism in preparing for a new war and disrupted the timeline of the Nobusuke Kishi government's attempt to force the passage of the new "Security Treaty" through the Japanese Diet, making an important contribution to the cause of peace in Asia and the world. He warned U.S. imperialism and the Nobusuke Kishi government that if they dare to launch a war of aggression, the people of the world will never forgive them and will surely eliminate them completely. His speech constantly aroused warm applause and slogans from hundreds of thousands of people in the audience.

Jinan

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 11th - Three hundred thousand people from all walks of life in Jinan City, Shandong Province, held rallies and demonstrations at fourteen venues yesterday afternoon to support the Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.

Workers, farmers, students, industrialists and businessmen, people from the scientific and technological fields, militiamen, and demobilized and retired soldiers participating in the rally, carrying placards and propaganda paintings and shouting slogans, marched magnificently through various streets, forming a powerful demonstration contingent, converging on various rally venues.

Liu Jiping, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, attended the meeting at the central venue.

Liu Binglin, Standing Committee member of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, spoke at the meeting on behalf of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. After exposing the aggressive nature of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, he said indignantly: We cannot forget the "May 3rd" tragedy single-handedly created by Japanese imperialism in Jinan in 1928, nor can we forget the September 18th Incident and the July 7th Incident, and even more so we cannot forget the profound disasters that Japanese imperialism once inflicted on our people. During the eight-year anti-Japanese war of aggression, more than ten million of our compatriots were sacrificed under the guns and bayonets of the Japanese invaders, and the people of Shandong also suffered profound disasters. Liu Binglin, on behalf of the people of the province, expressed firm opposition to U.S. imperialism's support for the revival of Japanese militarism and firm support for the Japanese people's just struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. He expressed his belief that the Japanese people's struggle, with the support of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and all peace-loving countries and people in the world, will surely achieve final victory.

In his speech, Liu Binglin pointed out: Any provocation by U.S. imperialism against the great Soviet Union, we regard as a provocation against the entire socialist camp.

Also speaking at the meeting were Li Chengzhi, Vice Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, heads of the Shandong Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, and the Jinan Municipal Women's Federation, representatives of local organizations of various democratic parties, as well as representatives of workers, students, and urban people's communes.

Liu Lianren, a fellow countryman who was abducted to Japan by Japanese imperialism and lived an inhuman life for thirteen years and returned from Japan in the spring of 1958, also came from his hometown to participate in the rally. Liu Lianren is now a member of the Jinggou Commune in Gaomi County. He said: Whenever I think of the Nobusuke Kishi government, I feel very angry. This traitorous group has always colluded with U.S. imperialism and wants to take the old path of aggression against China, which is impossible. He said that the evil Japanese invaders once made me endure thirteen years of inhuman life, and I will never forget the disasters that Japanese imperialism inflicted on the Chinese people.

Nanchang

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 11th - One hundred and twenty thousand people from all walks of life in Nanchang City, Jiangxi Province, held a rally in "August 1st" Square yesterday afternoon to support the Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.

Party and government leaders such as Fang Zhichun, Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Wang Dongxing, Vice Governor of Jiangxi Province, participated in the rally.

Guo Guangzhou, Alternate Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, spoke at the meeting, representing the people of the province in expressing firm support for the Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and expressing high respect to the indomitable Japanese people. He pointed out that the continuous struggle of the Japanese people has heavily hit the U.S. imperialism's conspiracy to plot a new war and has powerfully disrupted the Nobusuke Kishi government's timeline for attempting to pass the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty in the Japanese Diet.

Guo Guangzhou pointed out that the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism has not changed, nor can it change. In order to achieve its arrogant attempt to dominate the world, it is still stepping up its arms expansion and war preparations, and it is doing its utmost to arm West Germany in the West and stepping up the revival of Japanese militarism in the East. The Japanese militarism represented by Nobusuke Kishi is dependent on U.S. imperialism, attempting to relive its old dream of the so-called "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." Guo Guangzhou said that the thoroughly aggressive U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty is aimed primarily at the Soviet Union, China, Korea, Vietnam, and other countries in Asia. It has already brought serious threats to peace in Asia and the world and cannot but arouse serious vigilance and resolute opposition from the people of Asia and the world.

Subsequently, representatives of people's organizations and local organizations of democratic parties in Jiangxi Province, representatives of workers, farmers, members of urban communes, and students spoke at the meeting. The meeting finally passed a telegram from the people of Nanchang City, Jiangxi Province, supporting the Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.

Yinchuan

Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, 11th - More than 40,000 people from all ethnic groups and all walks of life in Yinchuan City held a rally and demonstration in Nanmen Square this afternoon, resolutely supporting the Japanese people's just struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.

Responsible persons of the Party, government, army, and various democratic parties and people's organizations of the Autonomous Region and Yinchuan City all participated in the meeting. Ma Yuhuai, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, spoke at the meeting. He said that the signing of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty has once again dragged the Japanese people onto the path of war, death, and disaster, and seriously threatens the security of China, the Soviet Union, and other Asian countries and world peace, and cannot but arouse the resolute opposition of the Chinese people, the people of Asian countries, and all peace-loving people in the world. He said that the people of Ningxia resolutely support the struggle of the Japanese people against this aggressive military alliance treaty. He also pointed out that the Japanese people's struggle is not isolated. The Chinese people, who have suffered from Japanese militarist aggression, and all peace-loving people in the world stand with the Japanese people. He pointed out that U.S. imperialism is supporting the revival of Japanese militarism with one hand. U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of all oppressed nations and people in the world. It has done all kinds of bad things, and its lifespan will not be too long. The Japanese people's struggle against U.S. imperialism, against the U.S.-Japan military alliance, against the revival of Japanese militarism, and for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality has unlimited bright prospects. As long as the Japanese people strengthen unity, persist in struggle, and with the support of the Chinese people and the people of Asia and the world, they will surely achieve final victory, and U.S. imperialism will surely be driven out of its territory by the Japanese people.

Subsequently, heads of various people's organizations and democratic parties, representatives of workers, suburban farmers, members of urban people's communes, and students spoke at the meeting. In their speeches, they all expressed high respect to the Japanese people who are fighting heroically for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality, and expressed firm support for the Japanese people's just struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.
