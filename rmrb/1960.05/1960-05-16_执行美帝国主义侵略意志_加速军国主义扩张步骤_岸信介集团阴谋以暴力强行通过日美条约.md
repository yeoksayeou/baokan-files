Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 15th: To please its American masters and, relying on the Japan-U.S. military alliance, to intensify the realization of its militaristic expansionist ambitions, the Kishi Nobusuke group is once again plotting to use violence to force the Diet to ratify the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." According to Japan's "Sankei Shimbun," the Kishi Nobusuke group plans to rely on the ruling party's majority of seats around May 20th to pass the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." If the opposition parties resist, they will bring the police into the Diet, use violence, and force it through.

Kishi Nobusuke's confidant, Secretary-General of the Liberal Democratic Party Masajiro Kawashima, stated arrogantly and outrageously at a press conference yesterday that even if the Japanese people petition, the Diet will still ratify the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." He clamored that the people's petitions "will not affect the ratification of the new Security Treaty."

Kawashima also declared at the press conference that "the deliberation of the Security Treaty has reached the final stage, and the current issue is when to end the deliberation of the Security Treaty Special Committee meeting." He also said that the Liberal Democratic Party's executive department "hopes to unify opinions within the party so that the treaty can be passed in the House of Representatives during this Diet session."

The increasingly strong unified action of the Japanese people against the ratification of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" has twice disrupted the timetable of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries to force the Japanese Diet to ratify this treaty. The Kishi Nobusuke group's plans to pass this treaty in the House of Representatives on April 26th and May 10th respectively have both failed.

The situation that the Japanese reactionaries have been unable to force the Diet to pass the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" has caused "serious anxiety" in the United States. According to Kyodo News Agency of Japan on the 14th, quoting sources from the Liberal Democratic Party, the United States recently expressed "informally" to the Japanese government "its concern about the stagnation of the Diet's deliberation of the Security Treaty." The United States also urged the Japanese government, saying: "The U.S. Congress is preparing to end the deliberation work before the end of June. Can the Japanese Diet pass the new Security Treaty?"

Kyodo News Agency said: The policy of the Japanese and U.S. governments is to ratify this treaty and bring it into effect this year. This timetable is based on the premise that the deliberation of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" will be largely completed before May 26th.

Kyodo News Agency also said that the United States is worried that if the Japanese Diet can only ratify it by the end of June, then due to the shorter session of the U.S. Congress this year, "the worst situation may occur, and the U.S. Senate will have to postpone ratification until next year."

The news agency also said: According to the U.S. policy of "absolutely avoiding postponing the exchange of ratification documents between the two countries until next year," the executive body of the Japanese ruling party is currently preparing "to strive for passage in the House of Representatives around the 20th."

According to the "Asahi Shimbun," since the current session of the Japanese Diet will expire on May 26th, the Kishi Nobusuke group is also plotting to extend the Diet session by one month after the vote in the House of Representatives in order to complete the legal procedures for ratifying this aggressive military alliance treaty in the Senate.

In order to realize their sinister conspiracy, Kishi Nobusuke and his confidants have been frequently meeting with the leaders of various factions of the ruling party in recent days, asking them to "cooperate" and "unite." However, some factions within the ruling party still advocate "prudent deliberation" and oppose the ruling party's unilateral vote and the use of police violence to forcibly pass this treaty.

### 执行美帝国主义侵略意志　加速军国主义扩张步骤  岸信介集团阴谋以暴力强行通过日美条约

    执行美帝国主义侵略意志　加速军国主义扩张步骤
    岸信介集团阴谋以暴力强行通过日美条约
    新华社15日讯　东京消息：为了取悦于美国主子和依赖日美军事同盟加紧实现军国主义的扩张野心，岸信介集团又在阴谋用暴力强使国会批准新日美“安全条约”。据日本“产经新闻”透露，岸信介集团预定在5月20日左右依仗执政党的多数议席通过新日美“安全条约”。如果在野党进行抵抗，他们就要把警察引进国会，施用暴力，强行通过。
    岸信介的亲信、自由民主党干事长川岛正次郎昨天在记者招待会上发表谈话，公然狂妄地表示，即使日本人民进行请愿，也要使国会批准新日美“安全条约”。他叫嚣说，人民的请愿“不会对批准新安全条约发生影响”。
    川岛还在记者招待会上宣称，“安全条约的审议已经到了最后阶段，当前的问题是，何时结束安全条约特别委员会会议的审议。”他并且说，自由民主党的执行部“希望统一党内意见，以便在这次国会会期内使条约在众议院获得通过”。
    日本人民日益强大的反对批准新日美“安全条约”的统一行动已经两次打乱了美日反动派强使日本国会批准这个条约的时间表。岸信介集团先后企图在4月26日和5月10日在众议院通过这个条约的计划都遭到失败。
    日本反动派迟迟未能迫使国会通过新日美“安全条约”的情况引起了美国的“严重不安”。据日本共同社14日援引自由民主党人士的话说，美国日前曾经向日本政府“非正式地”表示了“它对日本国会审议安全条约工作停滞不前的状况的忧虑心情”。美国还催促日本政府说：“美国国会准备在6月底以前结束审议工作，日本国会能否通过新安全条约？”
    共同社说：日美两国政府的方针是，在今年内批准这项条约并使它生效。这个时间表是以日美新“安全条约”的审议工作大体会在5月26日以前完成为前提而订立的。
    共同社还说，美国方面担心，如果日本国会到6月底才能批准，那么由于美国今年国会会期较短，“可能造成最恶劣的情况，美国参议院要推迟到明年批准。”
    这家通讯社还说：日本执政党的执行机构根据美国的“要绝对避免推迟到明年互换两国批准书”的方针，目前正在进行准备，“争取在20日前后在众议院通过。”
    据“朝日新闻”报道，由于日本国会这次会议将在5月26日期满，岸信介集团还阴谋在众议院表决以后，延长国会会期一个月，以便在参议院完成批准这个侵略性军事同盟条约的法律手续。
    为了实现他们的罪恶阴谋，岸信介和他的亲信这几天频繁地同执政党各派首脑会谈，要求他们“合作”，“团结一致”。但是，执政党内部有一些派系仍然主张“慎重审议”，反对执政党单独表决和用警察暴力强行通过这项条约的做法。
