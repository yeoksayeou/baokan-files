New Situation and New Tasks of Technological Innovation and Technological Revolution
Gao Feng, First Secretary of the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee of the CPC

    Technological innovation and technological revolution are a great revolution and a historical task of strategic significance. We are Marxist proponents of continuous revolution and the theory of revolutionary development stages. The further development of the revolution requires that while continuing to complete the socialist revolution on the economic front and the political and ideological fronts, we must comprehensively carry out the technological revolution and the cultural revolution. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in the article "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation": "Only when China thoroughly completes the socialist transformation in terms of social and economic systems, and uses machines in all departments and places where machine operations can be used, can the entire social and economic landscape be changed." Comrade Liu Shaoqi also pointed out in his report to the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party: "The call for a technological revolution and a cultural revolution means that our continuously developing revolution now needs to advance to a new stage." Continuously carrying out technological and cultural revolutions and developing science and technology at high speed will further accelerate socialist construction and create conditions for the future transition to communism. The improvement of the cultural and technical level of the broad masses of working people, the change of working conditions, and the elimination of heavy physical labor and manual operations will gradually narrow the gap between manual and mental labor. Therefore, the technological revolution is not a temporary or short-term assault task, but a long-term revolutionary task; it is not only an economic task, but also a political task.

    To vigorously engage in technological innovation and technological revolution is not only an urgent need for the high-speed development of the construction cause, but also possesses extremely favorable conditions. The basic completion of the socialist revolution on the economic front, the continuous adjustment of socialist relations of production, and the increasingly consolidated and sound development of the people's communes have opened up broad paths for the leap-forward development of productive forces. The great victory of the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts has further strengthened the socialist orientation of the broad masses of working people, and "wholeheartedly for socialism" has become the common will and demand of the entire people. They are eager to change the "poverty and blankness" and quickly get rid of heavy physical labor and manual operations to achieve a "second liberation." The further deepening of the general line, the implementation and practice education of the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, have further overcome right-leaning thoughts, eliminated "backwardness theory," "inferiority complex," "conditionalism" and various superstitious ideas, and greatly changed people's mental outlook. The continuous two years of Great Leap Forward and the development of the technological innovation and technological revolution movement have significantly improved the technical level of Qinghai Province and enriched its material strength. The development of the cultural revolution has improved the cultural level of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and herdsmen, especially the further in-depth development of the nationwide movement to study and publicize Mao Zedong Thought, which has greatly improved the political and ideological awareness and socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses, inspired their vigor, and strengthened their strength. In the great Mao Zedong era, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and herdsmen are all heroes with a high degree of communist style. They have the pioneering spirit of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do; the heroic spirit of fearing neither heaven nor earth, and the more difficulties, the greater their enthusiasm; the tenacious will of not fearing setbacks, failures, and persevering; and the ambition to create miracles and climb the peaks of science and technology. In front of them, difficulties are not only not obstacles on the road to progress, but on the contrary, they are the driving force to encourage them to move forward. This is the main reason for the great achievements of the technological innovation and technological revolution movement, and it is also an important guarantee for further realizing mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, and for building our country into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern scientific culture.

    The technological innovation and technological revolution movement is both a production movement and an ideological revolutionary movement of mass self-transformation. To carry out the technological revolution, we must first carry out the ideological revolution. With the idea of continuous revolution, there can be a great technological revolution and a great leap forward in production. Ideological revolution is the driving force of technological revolution, and technological revolution promotes the continuous revolution of thought. The process of technological revolution is the process of continuous revolution in thought, and it is also the process of struggle between the two lines of more, faster, better, and more economical versus less, slower, worse, and more expensive. Objective things are developing rapidly, and people's understanding is also constantly developing. The more thoroughly right-leaning thoughts are criticized, the more thoroughly thought is liberated, the better technological innovation will be carried out; the continuous development of technological innovation will constantly liberate people's minds. Politics is always the soul and the commander. To vigorously engage in technological innovation and technological revolution, we must adhere to putting politics in command, carry out mass movements on a large scale, thoroughly implement the Party's general line for socialist construction, thoroughly criticize and overcome right-leaning conservative ideas that hinder the development of the movement, educate cadres to deeply understand the far-reaching economic and political significance of technological innovation and technological revolution, establish the firm idea of long-term large-scale technological innovation and technological revolution, and fully exert people's subjective initiative, and promote revolutionary drive. We are carrying out a revolutionary cause of great historical significance. Every cadre and Communist Party member participating in this movement and leading this movement should have great revolutionary spirit and high revolutionary enthusiasm, should have the idea of continuous revolution that is never satisfied with the status quo, should have the spirit of never being willing to lag behind, catching up with the advanced, striving for the upper reaches, and striving for self-improvement, should have the communist style of not being superstitious, not being inferior, daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to do, should have the ambition to not be afraid of difficulties and hardships, determined to overcome nature, and climb the peaks of science and technology, should have the perseverance and determination to not be afraid of setbacks and failures, and resolutely complete the task, should have clear distinctions between right and wrong, serious and firm principles, should have a scientific spirit of seeking truth from facts and concrete analysis, should have a working attitude of not being arrogant or impetuous, being humble and prudent, diligent and conscientious, and assiduously studying, and should have a thorough, meticulous, and solid working style.

    The technological revolution is a long-term revolutionary task that must be carried out every day, every year, continuously, and regularly. The road of technological revolution is very broad, development is endless, and the potential of equipment and technology can never be fully tapped. Whether it is industry, agriculture, large factories, small factories, modern enterprises or handicraft workshops, all should vigorously engage in technological innovation and technological revolution. The worse the technical conditions, the more necessary it is to improve technology, the more backward the equipment, the more necessary it is to tap potential; the greater the production task and the shortage of labor, the more necessary it is to vigorously engage in technological innovation and improve labor productivity. The Qinghai Provincial Agricultural Reclamation Department system and the factories and mines in the Xining area originally planned to increase 3,000 laborers this year. After vigorously engaging in technological innovation, not only can 12,000 laborers be reduced, but the production task can also be increased by 30%. It should be recognized that technological innovation, technological revolution, and the completion of current production tasks and work tasks are completely consistent. Only by doing a good job in technological innovation and technological revolution can production tasks and work tasks be better completed. Conversely, if it is believed that production is too busy to engage in innovation, and only production is grasped without innovation, production will inevitably not be done well.

    Comprehensive planning and strengthening leadership are also the correct guidelines for carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution movements. Now, a nationwide high tide of technological innovation and technological revolution has been formed. We must strike while the iron is hot, strengthen leadership, and push the movement to a new high. This is the key to further comprehensively, systematically, and deeply developing the technological innovation and technological revolution movement. The situation is developing rapidly, and leaders must keep up closely, frequently go deep into reality, investigate and study, so that their thinking adapts to the rapidly developing objective situation, so that they can always walk in front of the movement and guide the movement forward. We must fully value technological innovation and technological revolution, regard it as a regular and important political task, personally grasp it, grasp it tightly, grasp it firmly, grasp it deeply, grasp it thoroughly, and grasp it to the end. Grasp ideological education, grasp mass movements, grasp overall planning, grasp summing up experience and forming a complete set, grasp experimentation and promotion. There should be both a three-year plan as a goal of struggle, and annual, quarterly, and monthly plans as a basis for action; attention should be paid to highlighting key points and taking care of the overall situation, and weak links should be discovered in a timely manner, and efforts should be concentrated on solving the main contradictions. With full enthusiasm and the greatest determination, actively mobilize the masses and support the masses' innovation. Any innovative suggestion should be actively studied. If it is feasible, it should be immediately organized for trial implementation. If it has defects, it should be helped to modify and supplement it. If it is temporarily unfeasible, the masses should be actively encouraged and helped to continue research. The experience that has been successfully tried out must be consolidated one by one and promoted one by one, and no one is allowed to lose one. Single, sporadic innovations must be closely studied, summarized, improved, and made into a complete set, and organized for promotion. Every successful experience should be quickly promoted to the whole factory, the whole commune, the whole industry, and various regions to give full play to their role. We must thoroughly criticize and overcome the bias of some units that only pay attention to research and creation, but do not pay attention to promotion, and only trial-produce new products but do not organize production.

    We must adhere to the policy of "walking on two legs" and starting from scratch and relying on our own efforts. Adapt measures to local conditions, obtain materials locally, combine indigenous and foreign methods, using foreign methods when possible, and indigenous methods when necessary, relying on our own efforts and mutual cooperation, tapping all potential, overcoming all difficulties, and resolutely not becoming a "hand-raiser." Now some comrades, although they are willing to implement technological innovation and technological revolution, either are divorced from reality, greedy for the big and foreign, and look down on the small and indigenous; or they think that without materials, they cannot innovate, and as soon as they innovate, they reach out to the state for a large amount of materials and equipment. Failure to thoroughly overcome this kind of thinking will hinder the development of the technological innovation and technological revolution movement. We must learn the spirit of workers to humbly learn, study hard, and the noble communist style of "finding materials ourselves if there are no materials, doing it ourselves if there are no funds, drawing our own drawings if there are no drawings, making our own tools if there are no tools, and using substitutes if there is no steel." As long as we have this spirit, no difficulties can stop us from moving forward.

    Vigorously engage in mass movements, implement the "three-in-one combination" of internal and external forces, and conduct large-scale cooperation from top to bottom, left to right. In the technological revolution, we must effectively strengthen the leadership of the Party, vigorously engage in mass movements, fully pay attention to giving play to the role of scientific and technical personnel, and mobilize all positive factors. We must establish a firm mass viewpoint, believe that since the masses can liberate themselves politically under the leadership of the Party, they will certainly be able to continue to conquer scientific and technological fortresses and become masters of nature under the leadership of the Party. The wisdom of the masses is endless. As long as we break superstitions, liberate our minds, establish ambitions, and set high goals, we can not only innovate and create, but also attack the cutting edge and climb the peaks in science and technology. Therefore, we must thoroughly criticize and overcome the bourgeois viewpoints and superstitious and inferiority thoughts of relying only on a few people, not believing in the masses, thinking that the masses "have low cultural levels and cannot engage in inventions and creations" or "can only engage in general things, not high-level things." We must educate cadres to understand: "Greatness comes from the ordinary," and science and technology come from practice. The workers and peasants have accumulated rich experience in long-term practice. They understand the problems within their work scope more specifically and deeply than others. For them, science and technology are not mysterious, profound, or unattainable. As long as we truly believe in the masses, adopt the methods of explaining the situation, clarifying tasks, and conducting great debates, deeply mobilize the masses, and have everyone offer ideas and everyone think of solutions, the technological innovation and technological revolution movement will develop rapidly and extraordinarily, overcome all difficulties, and create amazing miracles. Since the Great Leap Forward, many cutting-edge technologies that many people used to think could only be done by experts and senior technicians have been mastered by some ordinary workers and peasants; things that people used to think were impossible to do have been done and done well by ordinary workers and peasants. Zhang Rujia, an ordinary worker in the Xining Railway Bureau, created valuable instruments by breaking superstitions, liberating his mind, and studying hard and diligently. The petroleum workers in Qaidam broke the superstition of experts and books, dared to think and dared to act, and found oil in the continental sedimentary zone, greatly enriching the theory of petroleum geology. At the same time, we must also pay attention to giving full play to the role of scientific and technical personnel, and continue to educate them to understand that only under the leadership of the Party, combined with workers and peasants, and taking the road of being both red and expert, can they play a greater role. An effective method is to implement the "three-in-one combination" of internal and external forces under the leadership of the Party, with workers as the foundation, that is, to implement the three-in-one combination of leaders, technical personnel, and the masses within the factory and commune, and to implement the three-in-one combination of production departments, scientific research departments, and universities and secondary technical schools outside the factory and commune, mobilize all positive factors, and support the technological revolution. Some factories and mines have adopted the method of organizing "three-in-one combination" teams of leaders, technical personnel, and worker activists to focus on key points, cooperating with the broad masses to put forward innovative suggestions, which is very good. It can quickly break through key points, overcome weak links, and develop comprehensively from points to areas.

    Large-scale cooperation is an important link in comprehensively carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution and building socialism at high speed. The socialist public ownership of the means of production determines the fraternal cooperative relations between various units. Cooperation is also an important manifestation of the superiority of the socialist economy. Through mutual cooperation, joint operations, mutual exchange of what one has for what another needs, mutual assistance, and exchange of experience, we can concentrate the main force, ensure the completion of key tasks, solve the key problems that exist in common, overcome the difficulties that a single unit's strength can hardly overcome, coordinate mutual relations, and promote the development of production. Since the Great Leap Forward, especially in the technological innovation and technological revolution movement, the communist spirit of large-scale cooperation among the broad masses of workers has been greatly promoted, and the noble communist style of "putting others before oneself, sacrificing oneself for others," and "leaving difficulties to oneself and making it convenient for others" has become a new social atmosphere and moral standard. In the future, we should continue to promote this spirit, criticize the bourgeois worldview that only cares about oneself and does not care about others, widely organize large-scale cooperation among various industries, regions, units, and between production, transportation, and sales, as well as between production units, scientific research departments, and universities and secondary technical schools, and gradually incorporate some fixed cooperative relations into the national plan and establish fixed cooperative organizations. The socialist economy is originally a huge, unified whole, like a chain, with each link closely connected. If a unit takes a slower step, many units will be affected. We should especially emphasize proactive cooperation, proactively supporting others, and making it convenient for others, rather than passively waiting for others to request cooperation, and even less should we drag others down. Only through mutual cooperation and mutual promotion can we jointly leap forward.

    The technological innovation and technological revolution movement is promoting the rapid development of productive forces. We must consciously and timely adjust the relations of production and the superstructure to adapt to the development of productive forces and promote the greater development of productive forces. Countless facts have proven that every achievement of technological innovation and technological revolution has greatly improved labor productivity. Things that originally required many people to do can now be done by a few people. Things that originally took several days to do can now be done in a few hours or even a few minutes. Therefore, the operating process, labor organization, wage system, and the relationship between workshops, types of work, and even units, as well as regulations and systems that are no longer adapted, should be changed accordingly. At the same time, with the development of the technological innovation and technological revolution movement, the old balance will inevitably be broken and new imbalances will appear. This is a good thing. We should study and grasp its laws with a positive attitude, adjust the relations of production and the superstructure, improve enterprise management, improve leadership methods, overcome weak links, and organize a new balance.

    The development of the technological innovation and technological revolution promoted the development of the cultural revolution; the development of the cultural revolution, in turn, further promoted the technological innovation and technological revolution movement. The technological revolution and the cultural revolution are complementary. With the development of technological innovation and technological revolution, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and herdsmen are eager to learn culture and master scientific and technological knowledge. The unit where the technological innovation and technological revolution movement is carried out well, the workers and masses of that unit also have the highest enthusiasm for learning culture and science and technology. In order to solve a technical problem, many workers often run through bookstores, search through libraries, and browse through dozens of reference books. Some units could not start spare-time schools in the past, but as soon as they started the technological revolution, not only did they start them, but the people who studied were particularly enthusiastic. To meet the needs of this objective situation, we should seize the opportunity to quickly launch a new upsurge of the cultural revolution, vigorously run spare-time education, and vigorously promote the popularization of science and technology. Every workshop and every production team must vigorously run spare-time cultural schools, and every factory and commune must vigorously run spare-time technical schools and spare-time scientific and technological research institutes (groups), and do everything possible to improve the cultural, scientific, and technological level of the masses, popularize scientific and technological knowledge, to adapt to and promote the great development of the technological revolution.

    In order to ensure the continuous development of the technological revolution, we must further push the movement to study and publicize Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works to a new high, and arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought creatively developed and enriched Marxism-Leninism. It is the great truth that guides us in carrying out class struggle, and it is also the great truth that guides us in fighting against nature. To carry out any work, we must put Mao Zedong Thought in command, and learn to use Comrade Mao Zedong's spirit of continuous revolution to guide our construction cause. We must conscientiously study Comrade Mao Zedong's theory on socialist revolution and socialist construction, and combine this movement to study Mao Zedong Thought with the technological innovation and technological revolution movement, and combine it with the current tasks, so that theory is linked to practice, learning and application go hand in hand. At the same time, we must also combine learning theory with transforming ideology, criticizing and overcoming the bourgeois worldview. Let us hold high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, and carry out the technological innovation and technological revolution movement more vigorously and solidly, and develop our country's socialist construction cause at high speed.

    技术革新和技术革命的新形势、新任务
    中共青海省委第一书记　高峰
    技术革新和技术革命，是一个伟大的革命，也是具有战略意义的历史任务。我们是马克思主义的不断革命论者和革命发展阶段论者，革命的进一步发展，要求我们在继续完成经济战线和政治、思想战线上社会主义革命的同时，必须全面开展技术革命和文化革命。毛泽东同志在“关于农业合作化问题”一文中指出：“中国只有在社会经济制度方面彻底地完成社会主义改造，又在技术方面，在一切能够使用机器操作的部门和地方，通通使用机器操作，才能使社会经济面貌全部改观。”刘少奇同志在党的“八大”二次会议的报告中也指出：“提出技术革命和文化革命的号召，这就是说，我们不断发展的革命，现在又需要前进到一个新的阶段。”持续地开展技术革命和文化革命，高速度地发展科学技术，必将进一步加速社会主义建设，为将来向共产主义过渡创造条件。广大劳动人民文化技术水平的提高，劳动条件的改变，笨重体力劳动和手工操作的被排除，也将逐步缩小体力劳动和脑力劳动的差别。所以，技术革命不是一个临时的或短期的突击任务，而是一个长远的革命任务；不仅是一个经济任务，而且是一个政治任务。
    大搞技术革新和技术革命，不但是建设事业高速度发展的迫切需要，而且也具备了极其有利的条件。经济战线上社会主义革命的基本完成，社会主义生产关系的不断调整，人民公社的日益巩固和健全发展，为生产力的飞跃发展开辟了广阔的道路。政治思想战线上社会主义革命的伟大胜利，使广大劳动人民进一步坚定了社会主义方向，“一心一意为社会主义”成为全体人民的共同意志和要求，他们迫切地要求改变“一穷二白”面貌，要求迅速地摆脱笨重的体力劳动和手工操作，实现“第二次解放”。总路线的进一步深入人心，党的八届八中全会精神的贯彻执行和大跃进的实践教育，进一步克服了右倾思想，扫除了“落后论”、“自卑感”、“唯条件论”和各种迷信思想，大大地改变了人们的精神面貌。连续两年的大跃进和技术革新、技术革命运动的开展，显著地提高了青海省的技术水平，充实了物质力量。文化革命的开展，提高了广大职工、农牧民群众的文化水平，特别是全民性的学习和宣传毛泽东思想运动的进一步深入开展，大大地提高了广大群众的政治思想觉悟和社会主义积极性，鼓舞了干劲，增强了力量。在伟大的毛泽东时代，广大职工和农牧民群众，都是具有高度共产主义风格的英雄。他们有着敢想、敢说、敢做的首创精神，有着天不怕、地不怕、困难越多、干劲越大的英雄气概，有着不怕挫折、失败、百折不挠的顽强意志，有着创造奇迹、攀登科学技术高峰的雄心壮志。在他们的面前，困难不仅不是前进道路上的障碍，相反地是激励他们前进的动力。这是技术革新、技术革命运动取得巨大成绩的主要原因，也是进一步实现机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化，把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义强国的重要保证。
    技术革新和技术革命运动，既是个生产运动，又是个群众自我改造的思想革命运动。要进行技术革命，首先必须进行思想革命。有了不断革命的思想，才能有技术的大革命和生产的大跃进。思想革命是技术革命的动力，技术革命又推动思想的不断革命。技术革命的过程，就是思想上不断革命的过程，也就是多快好省与少慢差费两条路线的斗争过程。客观事物在迅速地发展，人们的认识也在不断地发展。右倾思想反得越透，思想解放得越彻底，技术革新就搞得越好；技术革新的不断发展，又不断解放了人们的思想。政治永远是灵魂、是统帅，要大搞技术革新和技术革命，必须坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，深入地贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线，彻底地批判和克服阻碍运动发展的右倾保守思想，教育干部深刻地认识技术革新和技术革命的深远的经济意义和政治意义，树立坚定的长期大搞技术革新和技术革命思想，充分发挥人们的主观能动性，发扬冲天的革命干劲。我们正在进行一场具有伟大历史意义的革命事业，参加这一运动和领导这一运动的每一个干部和共产党员，应该具有伟大的革命气魄和高涨的革命热情，应该有永不满足现状的不断革命思想，应该有永不甘于落后、赶先进、争上游、发奋图强的精神，应该有不迷信、不自卑、敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格，应该有不畏困难艰苦、决心战胜自然、攀登科学技术高峰的雄心壮志，应该有不怕挫折失败、坚决完成任务的毅力和决心，应该有显明的是非界限、严肃坚定的原则性，应该有实事求是、具体分析的科学精神，应该有不骄不躁、谦虚谨慎、勤勤恳恳、刻苦钻研的工作态度，应该有深入、细致、扎扎实实的工作作风。
    技术革命是一个长远的革命的任务，必须天天搞，年年搞，连续搞，经常搞。技术革命的道路是十分广阔的，发展是永无止境的，设备、技术的潜力是永远挖不尽的，不论工业、农业、大厂、小厂，现代化企业或手工作坊，都应该大搞技术革新和技术革命。技术条件越差，越要提高技术，设备越落后，越要狠挖潜力；越是生产任务大、劳动力不足，越要大搞技术革新，提高劳动生产率。青海省农垦厅系统、西宁地区的厂矿，原来计划今年需要增加三千个劳动力，大搞技术革新后，不但可以减少一万二千个劳动力，生产任务还能增加30％。应该认识到，技术革新、技术革命和完成当前的生产任务、工作任务，完全是一致的。只有搞好技术革新和技术革命，才能更好地完成生产任务和工作任务。相反地，如果认为生产忙不能搞革新，只抓生产，不抓革新，生产势必搞不好。
    全面规划，加强领导，也是开展技术革新和技术革命运动的正确方针。现在，全民性的技术革新、技术革命高潮已经形成，我们要趁热打铁，加强领导，把运动推向新的高潮。这是技术革新和技术革命运动进一步全面系统深入地开展的关键。形势在迅速发展，领导必须紧紧跟上，经常深入实际、调查研究，使自己的思想和迅速发展的客观情况相适应，才能经常走在运动的前面，指导运动前进。要充分重视技术革新、技术革命，把它作为一项经常的、重要的政治任务，亲自抓起来，抓紧、抓狠、抓深、抓透、一抓到底。抓好思想教育，抓好群众运动，抓好全面规划，抓好总结经验配套成龙，抓好试验、推广。既要有三年规划，作为奋斗目标，又要有年度、季度和月度计划，作为行动依据；既要注意突出重点，又要照顾全面，及时发现薄弱环节，集中力量解决主要矛盾。要以满腔的热情、最大的决心，积极地发动群众和支持群众的革新。对任何一条革新建议，都要积极研究，可行的立即组织试行，有缺陷的要帮助修改、补充，暂时不行的要积极鼓励和帮助群众继续研究。已经试行成功的经验，要有一条巩固一条、推广一条，不许丢掉一条。对单项的零星的革新，要抓紧进行全面系统的研究、总结、提高，使其配套成龙，并且组织推广。要把每一项成功的经验，迅速推广到全厂、全社、全行业和各个地区，充分发挥它们的作用。要彻底批判和克服某些单位只注意研究、创造，而不注意推广，和只试制新产品而不组织生产的偏向。
    必须坚持“两条腿走路”和白手起家、自力更生的方针。因地制宜，就地取材，土洋结合，能洋就洋，能土就土，依靠自己的努力和相互协作，挖掘一切潜力，克服一切困难，坚决不当“伸手派”。现在有些同志，虽然愿意实行技术革新和技术革命，但是他们或者是脱离实际、贪大求洋，看不起小的、土的；或者是认为没有材料就不能革新，一搞革新就伸手向国家要大量材料、设备。不彻底克服这种思想，就会阻碍技术革新和技术革命运动的开展。要学习工人同志们虚心学习、刻苦钻研的精神，和“没有材料自己找，没有资金自己搞，没有图纸自己描，没有工具自己造，没有钢材用代料”的高尚的共产主义风格。只要有这种精神，任何困难也阻挡不了我们前进。
    大搞群众运动，实行“内外三结合”，上下左右大协作。在技术革命中，必须切实加强党的领导，大搞群众运动，充分注意发挥科学技术人员的作用，调动一切积极因素。要树立坚强的群众观点，相信群众既然能够在党的领导下，在政治上解放自己，也一定能够继续在党的领导下，攻克科学技术堡垒，作自然的主人。群众的智慧是无穷无尽的，只要破除迷信，解放思想，树雄心、立大志，就不但可以革新创造，而且也能够在科学技术方面攻尖端，攀高峰。因此，要彻底批判和克服只依靠少数人，不相信群众，认为群众“文化低，搞不了发明创造”或者“只能搞一般的，不能搞高级的”等等资产阶级观点和迷信、自卑思想。要教育干部懂得：“伟大出于平凡”，科学技术来之于实践。工农群众在长期的实践中积累了丰富的经验，对自己工作范围内的问题，比别人了解得更具体、更深刻，对于他们说来，科学技术并不神秘奥妙和高不可攀，只要真正相信群众，采取交代形势、讲清任务，大鸣大放大辩论的方法，深入发动群众，个个出主意，人人想办法，技术革新和技术革命运动就会迅猛异常地开展起来，就会克服一切困难，创造出惊人的奇迹。大跃进以来，过去许多人认为只有专家、高级技术人员才能搞的尖端技术，一些普通工人、农民竟然掌握了；过去人们认为根本不可能办到的事，普通工人、农民竟然办到了、办好了。西宁铁路局一个普通工人张汝家，由于破除迷信、解放思想，苦学、苦钻，就创造了很有价值的仪器。柴达木石油职工，破除了对专家和书本的迷信，敢想、敢干，在陆相沉积地带找到了石油，大大地丰富了石油地质理论。同时，也要注意充分地发挥科学技术人员的作用，并且继续教育他们懂得，只有在党的领导下，和工人、农民相结合，走又红又专的道路，才能发挥更大的作用。行之有效的办法是在党的领导下，以工人为基础，实行内外“三结合”，即在厂内、社内实行领导、技术人员和群众三结合，厂外、社外实行生产部门、科学研究部门和大专、中等技校三结合，调动一切积极因素，支援技术革命。有些厂矿采取领导、技术人员和工人积极分子组织“三结合”小组主攻关键，配合广大群众普遍提革新建议的办法很好，可以迅速突破重点，克服薄弱环节，由点到面，全面发展。
    大协作，是全面开展技术革新和技术革命、高速度地建设社会主义的一个重要环节。社会主义的生产资料公有制，决定了各个单位间兄弟般的协作关系。协作也是社会主义经济优越性的重要表现。通过互相协作，联合作战，互通有无，互相帮助，交流经验，可以集中主要力量，保证重点任务的完成，可以解决共同存在的关键问题，可以克服一个单位本身的力量难以克服的困难，可以协调相互关系，促进生产的发展。大跃进以来，特别是在技术革新、技术革命运动中，广大职工的共产主义大协作的精神大大地发扬，“先人后己，舍己为人”，“把困难留给自己，把方便让给别人”的高尚的共产主义风格，已经成为新的社会风气和道德标准。今后应当继续发扬这种精神，批判只顾自己，不顾别人的资产阶级世界观，广泛组织各行业、各地区、各单位和产运销之间，以及生产单位、科学研究部门、大专中等技术学校之间的大规模的协作，并且逐步地把一些固定的协作关系纳入国家计划，建立固定的协作组织。社会主义经济本来就是一个巨大的统一的整体，像一个链条一样，一环与一环紧密衔接，一个单位的步子踏慢一点，许多单位都会受影响。应该特别强调主动协作，主动支援别人，给别人方便，而不是消极地等待别人来要求协作，更不应该拉别人的后腿。只有这样相互协作、相互促进，才能共同跃进。
    技术革新和技术革命运动，正在推动生产力迅速发展，我们要自觉地及时地调整生产关系和上层建筑，使之适应生产力的发展，促进生产力的更大发展。无数事实证明，技术革新和技术革命的每一项成就，都大大地提高了劳动生产率，原来需要很多人做的事，现在少数人就可以做完了，原来需要几天做的事，现在几个钟头、甚至几十分钟就可以做完了。因此，操作过程、劳动组织、工资制度和车间、工种以至单位之间的关系和已经不适应的规章制度，都应该相应地改变。同时，随着技术革新、技术革命运动的发展，必然不断地打破旧的平衡，出现新的不平衡。这是好事，应该以积极的态度，研究和掌握它的规律，调整生产关系和上层建筑，改善企业管理，改进领导方法，克服薄弱环节，组织新的平衡。
    技术革新和技术革命的发展，促进了文化革命的发展；文化革命的开展，反过来又进一步推动了技术革新和技术革命运动。技术革命和文化革命是相辅相成的。随着技术革新和技术革命的开展，广大职工、农牧民迫切要求学习文化，掌握科学技术知识。那个单位的技术革新、技术革命运动开展得好，那个单位的职工群众学习文化和科学技术的热情也最高。许多职工为了解决一个技术上的疑难问题，往往跑遍书店，找遍图书馆，翻阅数十本参考书。有些单位过去搞不起来业余学校，但是一开展技术革命，不但搞起来了，而且学习的人特别踊跃。适应这一客观形势的需要，我们应该抓紧时机，迅速地掀起一个新的文化革命高潮，大办业余教育，大搞科学技术的普及工作。每个车间、每个生产队都要大办业余文化学校，厂厂、社社都要大办业余技术学校、业余科学技术研究所（组），千方百计地提高群众的文化、科学技术水平，普及科学技术知识，以适应并促进技术革命的大发展。
    为了保证技术革命的不断开展，必须进一步把学习和宣传马克思列宁主义和毛泽东著作的运动推向新的高潮，用毛泽东思想武装我们的头脑。毛泽东思想创造性地发展了和丰富了马克思列宁主义，是指导我们进行阶级斗争的伟大真理，也是指导我们向自然界作斗争的伟大真理。进行任何工作，都必须以毛泽东思想挂帅，学会用毛泽东同志的不断革命论的精神来指导我们的建设事业。要认真学习毛泽东同志关于社会主义革命和社会主义建设的理论，并且把这一学习毛泽东思想的运动同技术革新、技术革命运动结合起来，同当前各项工作结合起来，作到理论联系实际，边学、边用。同时也要把学习理论同改造思想结合起来，批判和克服资产阶级世界观。让我们高举毛泽东思想的红旗，把技术革新、技术革命运动，更加轰轰烈烈、扎扎实实地开展起来，高速度地发展我国的社会主义建设事业。　（摘自青海“红与专”1960年第五期）
