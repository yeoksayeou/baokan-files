Xinhua News Agency, Kathmandu, May 3rd: People from all walks of life in Nepal have highly praised the signing of the Sino-Nepalese Treaty of Peace and Friendship. They generally believe that this is a new chapter in the friendly relations between the two countries. People are talking about this treaty everywhere, and such comments can be heard everywhere: "We are indeed happy to sign such a treaty," "This is very satisfactory," "This brings us closer and closer," "This is exactly what we want." Many Nepalese youths, teachers, and students went to the residences of Chinese friends to congratulate them on the signing of the treaty, and their feelings for each other were even closer than before.
    Bahadur, Vice President of the Nepal-China Friendship Association, said that the signing of this treaty reflects the wishes of the Nepalese people. The Nepalese people are willing to maintain friendship with China. Siddhi Charan, Vice Chairman of the All-Nepal Peace Committee, said that the Nepalese people welcome this treaty and China's friendly attitude towards Nepal in resolving border issues. Respected old poet Chitradhar said that since the past eight generations, his ancestors have had trade and cultural exchanges with Tibet, China. He said that our two countries have friendly relations, and the people of the two countries are as close as brothers. He is very happy that this close relationship is further built on the basis of a new treaty.
    A young trade union member said that for thousands of years, we Nepalese have believed that Chinese people are peace-loving and kind people. Our strong trust in this has never wavered. He said that only imperialists intend to undermine this friendship. Now, the new treaty further strengthens this trust and friendly relationship.
    The signing of the Sino-Nepalese Treaty of Peace and Friendship has become the central topic of Nepalese newspapers. The Nepalese "Language Newspaper" published an editorial yesterday saying that China's signing of treaties of peace, friendship, and non-aggression with Burma, and the signing of a treaty of peace and friendship with Nepal, all undoubtedly prove China's sincere desire to live in peace and friendship with its neighbors. "China has given a just answer to those international conspirators who attempt to call China an 'aggressor' and 'expansionist' and create rifts between China and other Asian countries."
    The "Current Affairs News" editorial warmly congratulated the signing of the Sino-Nepalese Treaty of Peace and Friendship, and agreed with Premier Zhou Enlai's statement that the signing of this treaty marks a new stage in the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Nepal. The newspaper particularly believes that the treaty stipulates that all issues between the two countries will be resolved through friendly negotiations, which is of great significance.

    尼泊尔各界人士和报纸热烈欢迎中尼和平友好条约
    中国真诚希望和邻邦和平友好地相处
    谴责帝国主义和国际阴谋家企图破坏中国同亚洲各国的关系
    新华社加德满都3日电　尼泊尔各界人士盛赞中尼和平友好条约的签订。他们一般都认为这是两国之间友好关系的新的一章。人们到处都在谈论这项条约，在各处都可以听到这样的评语：“签订这样的条约我们的确感到高兴”，“这是十分令人满意的事情”，“这使得我们愈来愈接近”，“这正是我们所希望的东西”。很多尼泊尔青年、教师和学生前往中国朋友的住所，对签订这项条约表示祝贺，彼此的感情比过去更见亲密了。
    尼泊尔—中国友好协会副会长巴哈杜尔说，这项条约的签订反映了尼泊尔人民的愿望。尼泊尔人民愿意同中国保持友谊。全尼泊尔和平委员会副主席西迪·查兰说，尼泊尔人民欢迎这项条约以及中国在解决边界问题上对尼泊尔的友好态度。受人尊敬的老诗人契塔迪尔说，自从过去八代以来，他的祖先一直同中国的西藏有着贸易和文化上的往还。他说，我们两国有着友好的关系，两国人民情同手足。他对把这种密切的关系进一步建立在新的条约的基础上感到非常高兴。
    一位年青的工会会员说，几千年来我们尼泊尔人一直相信，中国人是热爱和平的善良的人。我们对这种强烈的信任从没有动摇过。他说，只有帝国主义者打算破坏这种友谊。现在，新的条约进一步加强了这种信任和友好关系。
    中尼和平友好条约的签订已经成为尼泊尔报纸的中心议题。尼泊尔“语言报”昨天发表社论说，中国同缅甸签订和平友好和互不侵犯条约，同尼泊尔签订和平友好条约，这一切都无疑地证明中国希望同它的邻邦和平和友好地相处的真诚愿望。“中国已经给国际上的那些阴谋家以正当的回答，这些阴谋家企图把中国称为‘侵略者’和‘扩张主义分子’，并且在中国和其他亚洲国家之间制造裂痕。”
    “时事报”的社论热烈祝贺中尼和平友好条约的签订，并且赞同周恩来总理所说的这项条约的签订标志着尼中两国的友好合作关系进入了一个新的阶段。这家报纸特别认为，条约规定两国之间的一切问题将通过友好的谈判来解决这一点是有重大意义的。
