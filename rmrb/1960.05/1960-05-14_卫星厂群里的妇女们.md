The People's Commune Through the Ages

    Here is a new industrial zone. A year and a half ago, when you came here, you could only see a solitary large factory. In the morning, thousands of family members of the workers would emerge from their respective dormitories, carrying baskets, some without time to wash or dress, some holding sleepy children, hurrying and bustling to squeeze into the grain stores and vegetable stalls to buy things. That tedious, bothersome, day-to-day life began like this...

    Now, a people's commune has been established here, and 95% of the family members have joined production. Around this large factory, commune-run factories are like satellites orbiting a planet. Commune-run welfare institutions have become the workers' warm home. In the morning, family members walk out of the canteen alongside their husbands, then enter their respective factories, and in the evening, they walk into the cultural and technical night schools side by side. For a difficult arithmetic problem, for a small technical innovation, how many couples have studied under the electric light until late at night!

    This people's commune, centered on the Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Factory, has 13,000 members, including three small local state-owned factories and a large agricultural brigade in the near suburbs. The establishment of the people's commune has enabled the family members of this large factory to step out of the small family circles they have long been confined to and participate in social labor. Hardware factories, alcohol factories, glass factories, refractory brick factories, wood factories, file factories, and washing and dyeing, sewing, and shoemaking factories, as well as twelve canteens, seven nurseries and kindergartens, and sixteen service stations have been established to serve the large factory. In those still relatively simple satellite factory buildings, the surging torrent of the Great Leap Forward echoes like spring thunder. The family members are all serious and earnestly sitting beside the machines or holding tools to produce. Last year alone, they produced more than 92,000 refractory bricks, more than 3,000 kilograms of alcohol, more than 26,000 files, and more than 230,000 various simple machine parts for the large factory. They repaired tens of thousands of times (carts) of handcarts for the large factory and supplied round nails that were extremely scarce on the market. They also undertook the washing, dyeing, sewing, and mending tasks for more than 5,000 employees of the entire factory, and solved most of the problems of sewing cloth clothes and cloth shoes. Also last year, they created 440,000 yuan of wealth with their own hands, increasing the monthly output value from the initial 1,000 yuan to the current 100,000-plus yuan.

    Last year, the production tasks of the Textile Machinery Factory suddenly increased several times. At this critical moment, the iron wire that had always been supplied from other places was cut off. The factory sent several purchasing agents to Shanghai, Qingdao and other places to purchase, and the raw materials were first transported from Zhengzhou to the above-mentioned processing locations and then the finished products were transported back to Zhengzhou. However, Shanghai and Qingdao were also in the midst of the Great Leap Forward. The purchasing agents spent a great deal of effort to bring back the iron wire, but the caliber was not correct, and the carding machine could not be installed. This matter aroused the attention of all the female employees (a few months ago they were still family members) of the commune's hardware factory. They held a meeting to discuss and decided to solve this problem. The Party committee of the Textile Machinery Factory heard that they wanted to solve this problem and immediately agreed to provide support in all aspects. At the beginning, the family members did not fully understand the great significance of their behavior, but they already realized that this was solving a big problem for the big factory, and, moreover, this problem was one that their husbands, fathers, and brothers, whom they had always respected, had not solved. A sense of pride and ownership surged up, and they became bolder. They used all their spare time on this invention. They didn't go home until late at night, wearing work clothes and concentrating on a pile of machine parts picked up from the waste pile of the big factory. Sometimes their husbands would find them with the children they had picked up from the nursery, and seeing their wives working so hard and attentively, they were moved and sent the children back to the temporary nursery and joined the research. In this way, after several days and nights, the "wire drawing machine" was born.

    The commune-run factory is like a docile workshop of the big factory. Whatever the big factory needs, as long as they say a word, the commune-run factory can do it immediately. If they can't do it, they try to innovate. Especially when the big factory has a sudden task and needs certain missing parts to keep up in a timely manner, the commune's factory goes all out. In order to rush to produce more than 20,000 files, they brought bedding and cold steamed buns to the workshop, eating and sleeping there. The leaders didn't allow it and told them to go back, but they refused, saying that they no longer had family chores to worry about and should be responsible for the factory like their husbands. At that time, there were only forty female employees in the file factory, and a file machine had just been installed and they didn't know how to use it. They were all operating by hand, but the bold Liu Suhua and He Aiying, under the guidance of the thought of "guaranteeing key tasks and everything for the big factory," sat beside the machine and insisted that the machine listen to their commands. As a result, they were actually able to operate it. In this way, after working hard for more than twenty days, they helped the big factory complete the production increase task in August and September of last year in a timely manner. This incident caused a sensation throughout the machinery factory, and the employees all re-examined their wives, who had won victory after victory, with admiring eyes.

    At the entrance of the hardware factory, we saw a large pile of scrap iron wire, some rusted, only half an inch long, some with many knots. These things can be said to be waste among waste. In the past, the Textile Machinery Factory had it everywhere and people stepped on it. Now it has become a treasure. The female employees carefully picked it up, untied the knots, and then straightened it with a hammer, and used the broken machine parts from the big factory to make a native method rocking machine to make round nails. The family members sacrificed a lot of spare time to pick up waste materials in every corner of the big factory. Even the palm-sized pieces of wood could be put together to make small tables and small benches. Not only that, but the fuel used in their forging workshop was also found in the coal slag pile of the big factory. Once, a female employee named Liu Ronghua was sitting in the coal slag picking up coal, and a responsible comrade in the factory was deeply moved, but he deliberately raised a negative question to her: "Liu Ronghua, are you going to do industry with such small hands and feet?" She confidently said: "If we save a piece of coal, the big factory will have one more piece of fuel, and one more point of power." They proposed: if there is no house, build it ourselves; if there is no machine, do it by hand; if there is no material, use broken material; if we don't know the technology, study hard. They braved the scorching sun, sacrificed all their rest time, and ran all over the factory area and nearby streets and alleys. They searched for broken bricks, old tiles and gravel, and personally built 36 factory buildings. They brought their own 35 sewing machines from home, and also brought pliers, files, iron buckets and pots as production tools. The alcohol factory originally only had seven or eight female employees. They started by making alcohol in an open space with a small tin bucket, producing five kilograms a day. Later, they used four large oil drums, which could produce 200 kilograms a day. They were still not satisfied, saying, "It's still 25,000 miles away from the ideal." With the help of the big factory, they personally worked as bricklayers to build a building, building three large rooms of three stories. The big factory sent them a master, and they found equipment in the waste pile of the big factory and built a distillation tower several feet high, as well as a boiler room, fermentation tank, and laboratory. Now, if you go to the People's Commune of the Textile Machinery Factory, the first thing you see is the alcohol factory building, which has gone from nothing to something, from native to modern. It produces a large amount of alcohol every day.

    Now, the technical revolution and the cultural revolution are proceeding simultaneously in various commune-run factories. In a very short period of time, more than 400 female employees have become literate, and 370 technical innovations have been realized in three months. In order to more favorably promote the cultural and technical revolution movement, the commune leaders also cleverly made arrangements: so that the family members of the fitters of the Textile Machinery Factory can also be fitters in the commune factory, the family members of the carpenters can also be carpenters, and the family members of the lathe operators can also be lathe operators, so that husbands and wives become teachers and apprentices, and families become classrooms. Thus, a climax of the cultural and technical revolution is being staged in hundreds and thousands of families.

    On the eve of this year's March 8th International Women's Day, when Hua Aiqing, a female employee of the Hardware Factory, dedicated a technical innovation that she had worked hard to develop and increased work efficiency by nine times, she excitedly blushed and said to her female companions: "This is what he helped me research for several nights." This "he" is Tan Huaiyu, a fitter at the Textile Machinery Factory and Hua Aiqing's husband. The two often study and research until late at night. With her husband's help, Hua Aiqing became literate, entered senior primary school, and is also a pioneer of innovation in the commune's Hardware Factory.

    In this commune, the story of a family member named Liu Ronghua is widely circulated. This woman came from a very poor background and suffered a lot. After liberation, she was very satisfied with her small family that "doesn't have to worry about eating or drinking." She tried her best to serve her husband and maintain this "harmonious" family, but she was also afraid that someone would destroy her family and broke off contact with all her neighbors. The great storms of social life never blew into her threshold. The establishment of the people's commune brought her in without her realizing it. When she received a salary of fourteen yuan (now twenty-five yuan) for the first time in the commune office, her legs were so weak that she couldn't stand at the door, and she thought a lot... From then on, her husband treated her even better, which she had never felt since she got married, because this was an equal relationship. She felt that the people's commune made her an independent person in front of others for the first time. Since then, she has changed. She now works in the commune's dairy farm, replacing a young man. Sometimes she suddenly wakes up in the middle of the night and runs to the dairy farm. Her husband said she was "crazy and confused." She said: "I have never been so smart as I am now. I am afraid that others will not feed them well in the middle of the night and affect the milk production in the morning." She gets up again at four o'clock in the morning, carrying disinfected milk buckets to various canteens. Her husband was afraid that such a day and night would affect her health, so he bought a clock and told her to go to work on time. She said: "No matter what the time is, the dairy farm is mine, and my heart is tied to it!"

    卫星厂群里的妇女们
    陈健　刘传勋
    这里是一个新的工业区。一年半以前，你到这里来的时候，只能看见一座孤零零的大工厂。早晨，几千名职工家属从各自的宿舍走了出来，提着篮子，有的来不及洗脸整装，有的抱着没有睡醒的孩子，匆忙忙，熙攘攘的在一些粮食店、蔬菜摊挤着买东西，那繁琐的令人苦恼的日复一日的生活就这样开始了……
    现在这里成立了人民公社，95％的家属参加了生产。在这个大厂的周围，社办工厂像卫星环绕着行星。社办福利机构成了工人们的温暖的家。早晨，家属们和自己的丈夫并肩从食堂里走出来，然后走进各自的工厂，晚上又并肩走进文化技术夜校。为了一道难演的算术题，为了一件小小的技术革新，有多少对夫妻在电灯下研究到深夜啊！
    这个以郑州纺织机械厂为中心成立的人民公社，有一万三千名社员，它包括三个小型的地方国营工厂和近郊一个农业大队。人民公社的建立，使这个大厂的家属走出长期以来固守着的家庭小圈子，参加社会劳动。成立了为大工厂服务的五金厂、酒精厂、玻璃厂、耐火砖厂、木工厂、锉刀厂及洗染、缝纫、制鞋等工厂和十二个食堂、七个托儿所幼儿园、十六个服务站。那些还比较简陋的卫星厂房里，传出春雷般的跃进激流，家属们个个严肃而又认真地坐在机器旁或手执工具在生产。去年一年，她们为这个大厂生产九万二千多块耐火砖，三千多公斤酒精，二万六千多把锉刀，各种简单机件二十三万多件，她们为大工厂补修了几万次（辆）架子车，供应了市场上极端缺乏的圆钉。她们还承担了全厂五千多名职工的洗、染、缝、补任务，解决了大部分布衣、布鞋的缝制问题。也是去年，她们用双手创造了四十四万元的财富，使每月的产值由最初的一千元提高到现在的十几万元。
    去年纺织机械厂，生产任务突增几倍，正在这紧要关头，一向靠外地供应的铁丝中断了。厂里派了几名采购员到上海、青岛等地采购，而且是把原料从郑州先运往上述加工地点之后再将成品运回郑州。可是上海、青岛也在大跃进，采购员费了九牛二虎之力才把铁丝弄回来，但是不对口径，梳棉机不能安装，这件事引起公社五金工厂全体女职工（几个月以前她们还是家属）的关注。她们在一起开会研究，决定解决这个问题。纺织机械厂党委听说她们要解决这个问题，马上答应从各方面给予支援。事情刚开始时，家属还没有完全理解她们这种行为的重大意义，但已经意识到这是为大工厂解决大问题，而且，这问题又是被她们一向尊重的丈夫、父兄没有解决的问题，自豪感和主人翁感一涌而上，胆子也大起来了，他们把所有业余时间都用在这项发明创造上。半夜三更都不回家，穿着工作服，全神贯注在一堆从大工厂废料堆中拣来的机件上。有时她们的丈夫抱着从托儿所接回的孩子去找，看见自己的妻子，那样刻苦专注地在工作，感动得把孩子又送回临时托儿所，也参加研究。就这样，几个昼夜，“拔丝机”诞生了。
    社办工厂就像大工厂的一个驯服的车间，大厂需要什么，只要说一句话，社办工厂能办的立即就办，办不到的设法搞创造发明。特别是当大厂有了突击任务，需要某些缺门机件及时跟上时，公社的工厂全力以赴。她们为了突击两万多把锉刀的生产任务，把铺盖卷、冷馒头带到车间，吃在那里，睡在那里，领导上不允许，叫她们回去，都不肯，还说，已经没有家务牵连了，应该和自己的丈夫一样，对工厂负责。那时锉刀厂只有四十个女职工，一部锉刀机刚安装好，还不会用，都是用手操作，但是大胆的刘素花、何爱英在“保证重点，一切为大厂”的思想支配下，坐在机器旁，硬叫机器听她的使唤，结果，居然能操作了。就这样苦干了二十几天，及时帮助大厂完成了去年8、9月的增产任务。这件事，轰动了整个机械厂，职工们都用敬慕的眼光，重新打量着自己的一次又一次取得胜利的妻子。
    我们在五金工厂门口，看见了一大堆废铁丝，有些上了锈，只有半寸长，有些挽了许多疙瘩，这些东西可以说是废料中的废料了。过去，纺织机械厂到处都有，被人们踩在脚底下，现在成了宝贝，女职工们细心的把它拣起来，把疙瘩解开，然后，用锤子打直，用大厂的破机件制成土法摇扳机，制成圆钉。家属牺牲了许多业余时间，在大厂的每个角落拾废料，即使那巴掌大的木块，也能凑起来做成小桌子、小板凳。不仅这些，她们锻工车间用的燃料，也都是在大工厂的煤渣堆中找来的。有一次一位叫刘荣花的女职工坐在煤渣中拣煤块，厂里一位负责同志深受感动，但他故意向她提出了反面问题：“刘荣花你就这样小手小脚搞工业吗？”她自信的说：“我们省一块煤，大工厂就多一块燃料，就多一分动力。”她们提出：没有房子自己建，没有机器手工干，没有材料用碎材，不会技术苦钻研。她们冒着酷热的太阳，牺牲所有休息时间，跑遍了厂区和附近大街小巷，她们搜找破砖旧瓦和碎石，亲自盖成三十六间厂房，她们从家里抬来了自己的三十五部缝纫机，也拿来钳子、锉刀、铁桶和盆盆罐罐作为生产工具。酒精厂原来只有七、八个女职工，开始用一个小洋铁桶在露天地里做酒精，一天生产五公斤，后来又用四个大油桶做，一天能生产二百公斤，她们还不满足说，“离理想还差两万五千里”，在大厂的帮助下自己又亲自当泥工盖楼房，盖了三层三大间。大厂给她们派来了师傅，她们又在大厂废料堆中找出设备，搞了一个几丈高的蒸馏塔，又搞了锅炉房、发酵池、化验室。现在，你到纺织机械厂人民公社去看一看，首先映入你眼前的就是那个由无到有，由土到洋的酒精厂大楼，它每天生产着大量的酒精。
    现在，技术革命和文化革命双管齐下，正在各个社办工厂展开，在很短的时间内，四百多名女职工脱了盲，三个月的时间内实现了三百七十条技术革新。为了更有利于促进文化技术革命运动，公社领导还巧妙的作了安排；使纺织机械厂钳工的家属在公社工厂也可当钳工，木工家属也当木工，车工家属也当车工，使夫妻成为师徒，家庭成为课堂，于是一场文化技术革命的高潮，就在成百上千个家庭中上演。
    今年三八节的前夕，当五金工厂的女职工华爱卿献出了自己的苦心钻研、提高工效九倍的一项技术革新时，她激动地红着脸向女伴们说：“这是他帮助我搞了几个半夜才研究出来的”。这个“他”就是华爱卿的丈夫纺织机械厂的钳工谭怀玉。夫妻两个经常学习研究到深夜。华爱卿在丈夫的帮助下，脱了盲，进了高小，也是公社五金厂的革新能手。
    在这个公社里，盛传着一位叫刘荣花的家属的故事。这个妇女出身相当贫困，受过许多罪。解放以后她对“一不愁吃，二不愁喝”的小家庭很自满。她百般侍奉丈夫，保持这个“和睦”的家，但又生怕什么人破坏她的家，和一切邻人断绝来往。社会生活的大风暴，几次都没有吹进她的门槛。人民公社一成立，使她不自觉的卷了进来。当她第一次在公社办公室领到十四元工资时（现在二十五元），感动的两腿发软立在门口走不动了，而且想了许多……。从此丈夫对她更好，是她结婚以来不曾感到过的，因为这是平等的关系，她感到人民公社使她第一次在别人面前是个独立的人。从此她变了，她现在在公社奶牛场工作，代替了一个小伙子。她有时半夜突然醒来，朝牛奶场就跑，丈夫说她“发疯糊涂了”。她说：“啥时候我也没有现在聪明，我怕半夜别人喂不好，影响早晨出奶”。早晨四点钟又起来了，挑着消过毒的牛奶桶送到各个食堂。她的丈夫怕她这样不分昼夜影响身体的健康，买了一个钟，叫她按时上班，她说：“管他钟点不钟点，奶场是我的，我的心就拴在那上头！”
