The Daye Steel Plant
　　Crude iron production completed half of the annual plan, an increase of 76.62% over the same period last year

　　Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, May 16th: By May 13th, the Daye Steel Plant had completed half of its annual crude iron plan forty-eight days ahead of schedule. Compared with the same period last year, the total output of crude iron increased by 76.62%, and the coke consumption per ton of crude iron decreased from 0.725 tons last year to 0.675 tons. The quality of crude iron was all up to standard.

　　In order to ensure the early completion of the semi-annual crude iron production plan, the iron smelting workers of the Daye Steel Plant have promoted a series of advanced experiences this year. Hot stove workers learned advanced experiences such as rapid combustion and intensified combustion from the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, and at the same time promoted the operation method of "frequent fire watching and frequent adjustment," which increased the wind temperature from 800 degrees to 900 degrees, with a maximum of 940 degrees. The furnace workers learned many advanced operating systems to strengthen furnace condition management, and improved the slag arrester, which quickly stabilized the furnace condition and increased production.

　　Now, the iron smelting workers of this plant have decided to continue to carry out the high-yield movement, speed up the construction of new blast furnaces, and ensure the early and over-fulfillment of the annual crude iron production plan.

　　Hebi Coal Mine
　　The semi-annual coal production plan was completed ahead of schedule, and the cost was reduced by nearly half compared to the plan

　　Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, May 16th: All the employees of the Hebi Coal Mine beat the war drums and advanced in high spirits, over-fulfilling the semi-annual national production plan fifty days ahead of schedule. As of the 11th, the cumulative output of raw coal in this coal mine this year has exceeded the national semi-annual plan by 17.5%; the tunneling footage has also completed more than half of the annual national plan. Other economic indicators have also achieved comprehensive success: the efficiency of all employees has increased by 9.2% compared with the plan, the consumption of pit wood per thousand tons has decreased by 18.6% compared with the plan, and the cost of raw coal per ton has decreased by 45.4% compared with the plan.

　　Since the beginning of this year, the Hebi Coal Mine has effectively mobilized the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses in completing the plan by carrying out large-scale innovation, selecting pacesetters, carrying out technical performance competitions, and holding production sports meetings. In the past few months, a total of 659 national, provincial, and municipal pacesetters have emerged in the mine, achieving red flags in all aspects and pacesetters in all types of work, thus ensuring that the production upsurge in the mine is higher than the previous one. In order to make coal production red every day, high every ten days, catch up every month, leap every quarter, and be red to the end of the year, the leading cadres of each mine have also gone to the front line to focus on the key to production together with the workers, further promoting the leap forward in production.

　　At present, the workers of the Hebi Coal Mine are continuing to fight hard in the great situation, striving to overproduce more coal for the country in the first half of the year.

　　Guangzhou Yuanhang Sail Sewing Factory
　　Focusing on both innovation and production, completing half a year's production tasks in four months

　　Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, May 16th: The Guangzhou Yuanhang Sail Sewing Factory adopted the working method of "grasping with both hands" and comprehensively completed all tasks. By the end of April, it had completed the semi-annual production tasks comprehensively and ahead of schedule by two months. Among them, the output value completed 55.75% of the annual plan, the output of sail tents completed 117.5% of the semi-annual plan, and the quality positive product rate reached 99.2%. Compared with the same period last year, labor productivity increased by 55%, costs decreased by 34.2%, and profits turned over increased by 19 times.

　　In order to do a good job in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, and to do a good job in the current production, this factory established a "Four Modernizations Movement Leading Group" and a "Production Command" respectively; the Party Branch Secretary focused on "Four Modernizations," and the factory director focused on production. They met every day to exchange information and progress, so that the technical innovation movement was closely linked to the needs of current production. For example, the thread core process was originally a weak link in the factory's production. The leadership mobilized the workers to work hard overnight and made a thread core machine, saving half of the labor force and increasing production efficiency by nine times, so that the thread core production closely followed the needs of the factory. They also adopted the method of innovating one item and putting it into production, innovating a batch and putting it into production. Within more than two months, they realized a semi-automated workshop, an automatic production line, two automated single machines, and seventeen mechanized machine tools, thus rapidly promoting the leap forward in production.

　　Another aspect of "grasping with both hands" is to grasp the current production on the one hand and prepare for production on the other. In terms of raw materials, they resolutely implemented the preparation for the next season and the next month in the previous season and the previous month, and the preparation for the next ten days in the previous ten days, and regularly ranked the main and auxiliary materials according to season, month, and ten days. If the insufficient part was found, they mobilized the workers to find ways to regenerate themselves. For example, if the main raw material, canvas, was insufficient, they sent salespersons to relevant units to purchase local canvas outside the national plan management, and also purchased waste cotton wadding, cotton, and rags to entrust the rural people's communes to process into local canvas, thus ensuring the monthly early completion of production tasks.

　　Grasping production on the one hand and life on the other is also a part of this factory's implementation of the "grasping with both hands" working method. They designated the trade union to be specifically responsible for doing a good job in the welfare of the workers, such as running nurseries and canteens, so that the workers could devote themselves more wholeheartedly to production and technical innovation.

    提前报捷音　乘胜多超产
    大冶钢厂  
    生铁产量完成全年计划一半比去年同期增长了76.62％
    新华社武汉16日电　大冶钢厂到5月13日止，已经提前四十八天完成了全年生铁计划的一半。与去年同期比较，生铁总产量增长了76.62％，每吨生铁的焦炭消耗量由去年的零点七二五吨降到零点六七五吨，生铁质量全部合格。
    为了保证提前完成上半年生铁生产计划，大冶钢厂炼铁职工今年以来推广了一系列先进经验。热风炉工人学习了石景山钢铁公司的快速燃烧和强化燃烧等先进经验，同时推广了“勤看火、勤调剂”的操作方法，使风温由八百度提高到九百度，最高达九百四十度。炉前工人学习了加强炉况管理的许多先进操作制度，并且改进了避渣器，使炉况很快稳定好转，产量上升。
    现在，这个厂的炼铁职工决定继续开展高产运动，加紧建设新高炉，确保提前超额完成全年生铁生产计划。
    鹤壁煤矿
    上半年产煤计划提前完成成本比计划降低将近一半
    新华社郑州16日电　鹤壁煤矿全体职工大擂战鼓，高歌猛进，提前五十天超额完成上半年国家生产计划。截至11日统计，这个煤矿今年原煤的累计产量，已经超过国家上半年计划17.5％；掘进进尺也完成了全年国家计划的一半以上。其他各项经济指标也都全面告捷：全员效率比计划提高9.2％，坑木千吨耗比计划下降18.6％，原煤成本每吨比计划下降45.4％。
    鹤壁煤矿今年以来通过大搞革新、选拔标兵、开展技术表演赛和举行生产运动会等形式，有效地调动了广大群众对完成计划的积极性和创造性。几个月来，全矿共涌现出全国、省、市级标兵六百五十九名，作到了各方面有红旗，各工种有标兵，因此保证了全矿生产热潮一浪高过一浪。为使煤炭生产日日红、旬旬高、月月赶、季季跃、全年红到底，各矿领导干部也都亲赴前线，同职工一起大抓生产关键，进一步推动了生产的跃进。
    目前，鹤壁煤矿职工正乘着大好形势继续奋战，力争在上半年为国家超产更多的煤炭。
    广州市远航帆缝厂
    一手抓革新　一手抓生产四个月完成半年生产任务
    新华社广州16日电　广州市远航帆缝厂采取“两手抓”的工作方法，全面做好各项工作，到4月底止已提前两个月全面超额完成了上半年的生产任务，其中产值完成了年计划的55.75％，帆帐篷产量完成了上半年计划的117.5％，质量正品率达到99.2％；与去年同期比较，劳动生产率提高55％，成本降低34.2％，上缴利润增长十九倍。
    这个厂为了做到一手抓好以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，一手抓好当前生产，分别成立了“四化运动领导小组”和
  “生产指挥部”；由党支部书记着重抓“四化”，厂长着重抓生产，每天碰头交换情况和进度，使技术革新运动紧紧结合当前生产上的需要来进行。比如打线芯工序原是全厂生产中的一个薄弱环节，领导方面便发动职工苦战一夜，制成一台打线芯机，节省劳动力一半，提高生产效率九倍，使线芯生产紧紧跟上了全厂的需要。他们还采取了革新一项，投入生产一项，革新一批，投入生产一批的办法，在两个多月内实现了半自动化车间一个、自动生产线一条、自动化单机两台、机械化机台十七台，因而迅速推动了生产的跃进。
    “两手抓”的另一个方面是，一手抓当前生产，一手抓生产准备工作。在原料材料方面，他们坚决贯彻实行上季上月为下季下月准备，上一旬为下一旬准备，并且按季、按月、按旬定期对主料和副料进行细致的排队，不足部分就发动职工想办法自力更生。如主要原料帆布不足，他们便派供销员到有关单位采购国家计划管理以外的土帆布，又收购废旧棉胎、棉花和碎布委托农村人民公社加工为土帆布，因而保证了生产任务的月月提前完成。
    一手抓生产、一手抓生活，也是这个厂贯彻“两手抓”工作方法的一个内容。他们指定工会专门负责做好职工的生活福利工作，如办好托儿所、食堂等，使职工们更加专心致志地投身到生产和技术革新中去。
