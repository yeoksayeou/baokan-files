To what extent can one freight truck replace several? What is the ultimate potential of a vehicle? The fact that Wang Tianxiang, a driver from the Xuchang Highway Transportation Company in Henan Province, increased his vehicle's monthly tonnage from several thousand ton-kilometers to 170,000 ton-kilometers within a year provides great inspiration.

With the acceleration of production and construction, freight volume must increase accordingly, and the number of transport vehicles must also increase. However, the increase in vehicles is ultimately limited. Therefore, the most practical and effective way to complete transportation tasks is to tap into the potential of transportation, allowing one vehicle to perform the work of two, or even more, to support the continued leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. The high-yield record of 170,000 ton-kilometers per month created by Wang Tianxiang's vehicle powerfully reveals the potential of automobile transportation. Some people believe that automobiles are simply transportation tools, and their carrying capacity is limited. Indeed, when people view automobiles merely as transportation tools, they are restricted by their designed load capacity. Wang Tianxiang's vehicle has a designed load capacity of four tons, but his actual towed load exceeds twenty tons. The reason Wang Tianxiang's vehicle can unleash such great potential is that he recognizes that automobiles are not only transportation tools but also traction tools. To maximize the role of a vehicle, its traction force must be fully utilized. In the technical innovation and revolution movement, people can not only maximize the use of the vehicle's traction force but also increase it through innovation. This is the reason why one vehicle can perform the work of several.

The fact that the same vehicle experienced such a dramatic change within a year—is this merely a change in the utilization of the automobile? No. The most fundamental change lies in people's mental state. A year ago, the monthly tonnage of Wang Tianxiang's vehicle was only several thousand ton-kilometers. At that time, based on his narrow experience, he felt that automobiles did not need innovation and were impossible to innovate. Based on this understanding, he could not possibly initiate technical innovations. When Wang Tianxiang, with the help of the Party organization and the masses, raised his political awareness and resolved to strive to be an advanced worker forever, he discovered that even foreign equipment had imperfections, and even advanced driving methods contained backward elements. Foreign machinery and equipment not only needed to be reformed but were also possible to reform. Why was Wang Tianxiang unable to recognize the law that all machinery and equipment needs innovation and is possible to innovate in the past, but now he does? There is only one reason: politics took command in his thinking. His mental state transformed from stagnation to continuous revolution, and his enthusiasm underwent a revolutionary change. We have always believed that laws exist objectively, but grasping the laws of things is not easy; it requires persistent struggle. Only those with advanced thinking, full of enthusiasm, focused dedication, and unwavering determination can recognize and master them in constant practice and fully utilize human subjective initiative according to objective laws. The thought of continuous revolution and soaring enthusiasm give people great fearlessness and also give people the ability to see clearly. Without this bold and meticulous spirit of innovation, it is impossible for one vehicle to perform the work of several.

The high-yield record created by Wang Tianxiang's vehicle has raised the national automobile transportation "safety, economy, monthly tonnage of ten thousand ton-kilometers" movement to a new level. Currently, the movement to catch up with Wang Tianxiang is flourishing everywhere. In Henan Province, a group of outstanding young drivers is closely following Wang Tianxiang, achieving high-yield results of 100,000 to 150,000 ton-kilometers per month. In the Qaidam Basin of Qinghai, the heroic automobile driver Liu Xinguo also broke through the 100,000-ton-kilometer mark. All workers on the automobile transportation front: Currently, the broad masses of workers on the industrial front are fighting with all their might to complete half of the year's plan in the first half of the year. They need you to transport more raw materials and materials, and the rural areas need you to transport more means of production and daily necessities. Transportation workers must transport more and faster to ensure high production, transporting as much cargo as possible. Wang Tianxiang's vehicle has already created the highest record of transporting more and faster with their actions. Let everyone race against Wang Tianxiang's automobile! Learn from Wang Tianxiang, catch up with Wang Tianxiang, and surpass Wang Tianxiang!

    同王天祥汽车赛跑
    一辆货运汽车能不能顶几辆用？一辆汽车的潜力到底有多大？河南省许昌公路运输公司王天祥驾驶的汽车一年之间车吨月产量由几千吨公里上升到十七万吨公里的事实，给了人们很大的启发。
    生产建设加快，货运量就要相应地增加，运输车辆也要随之增加。但是，车辆的增加毕竟是有限的。因此，完成运输任务最现实、最有效的办法，还是挖掘运输的潜力，让一辆车顶上两辆车，或者顶上更多辆车的效能，支援工农业生产的继续跃进。王天祥汽车创造的月产十七万吨公里的高产纪录，正有力地揭示了汽车运输的潜力。有人以为，汽车是一种载运工具，它的运量是有限的。不错，当人们仅仅把汽车看作载运工具时，它的确受到设计载重量的限制。王天祥驾驶的汽车设计载重量是四吨，而他的拖挂实载量却在二十吨以上。王天祥驾驶汽车所以能够发挥这样大的潜力，因为他认识到汽车不仅是一种载运的工具，也是一种牵引的工具，一部汽车要发挥更大的作用，就要充分利用其牵引力；在技术革新和技术革命运动中，人们不仅能够最大限度地利用汽车的牵引力，而且能够通过革新，增加汽车的牵引力。这就是一辆车能顶上几辆车用的道理所在。
    同样一辆汽车，一年前后却发生如此巨大的变化，难道这仅仅是汽车利用方面的变化么？不。发生变化的最本质的地方还是人们的精神状态。一年之前，王天祥汽车的车吨月产量不过几千吨公里。当时，他根据自己狭隘的经验，觉得汽车是不需要搞革新，也是不可能搞革新的。基于这个认识，他也就不可能动手去搞技术革新。当王天祥在党组织和群众的帮助下，提高了政治觉悟，下定了争取永远当先进的决心，他便发现了洋设备也有不完善的地方，先进的行车方法也包括着落后的因素，洋机器设备不仅需要改革，而且也是可能改革的。为什么王天祥过去认识不到一切机器设备都是需要革新又可能革新的规律，现在认识到了呢？道理只有一条：政治在他的思想中挂了帅。他的精神状态从停滞不前转变为不断革命，干劲也就发生了革命性的变化。我们从来认为规律是客观存在的，但是掌握事物的规律并不是轻而易举的，必须进行顽强的斗争。只有思想先进、干劲十足、专心致一、百折不挠的人，才能在不断实践中，认识它、掌握它，并能根据客观规律来充分发挥人的主观能动作用。不断革命的思想和冲天的干劲，给予人们大无畏的勇敢，也给予人们明察秋毫的本领。没有这种胆大又心细的革新气概，一辆车要发挥几辆车的作用，是不可能的。
    王天祥汽车创造的高产纪录，使全国汽车运输开展的“安全、节约、车吨月产万吨公里”运动，提高到一个新的水平。目前，各地追赶王天祥的运动正在蓬勃兴起，河南省已经有一批优秀的青年司机，紧紧地追赶在王天祥的后面，达到了车吨月产十万到十五万吨公里的高产成绩。在青海柴达木盆地，英雄的汽车司机刘新国也突破了十万吨公里大关。汽车运输战线上的全体职工们：现在，工业战线上的广大职工正在为上半年完成全年计划的一半而全力奋战。他们需要你们运送更多的原料和材料，农村需要你们运送更多的生产资料和日用品。运输职工要以多运快运保高产，有多少货物运多少。王天祥汽车已经用他们的行动创造了多运快运的最高纪录，大家都来同王天祥驾驶的汽车赛跑吧！学习王天祥，赶上王天祥，超过王天祥！
