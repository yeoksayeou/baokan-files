Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 24th. The Jakarta "East Star Daily" and "Dawn Daily" today expressed their support for the heroic struggle of the Japanese people against the Japanese reactionaries' conclusion of a military alliance treaty with US imperialism.

	The "East Star Daily's" editorial said that the struggle against the Kishi Nobusuke government, surging vigorously inside and outside the Japanese Diet, has already placed Kishi Nobusuke in an isolated position.

	The editorial pointed out that the military collusion between Kishi Nobusuke and US imperialism has placed Japan under the threat of war and turned Japan into a base for conducting military provocations. This is intolerable to the Japanese people.

	"Dawn Daily" said that the reason the Japanese people oppose the Japan-US military treaty is that they are unwilling to fight against China and the Soviet Union, and they are also unwilling to see the United States establish nuclear weapon bases and air force bases in Japan.

    雅加达“东星报”说
    日本人民斗争浪潮汹涌澎湃  岸信介集团已陷于孤立地位
    据新华社雅加达24日电　雅加达“东星报”和“黎明日报”今天表示支持日本人民反对日本反动派同美帝国主义缔结军事同盟条约的英勇斗争。
      “东星报”的社论说，在日本国会内外汹涌澎湃的反对岸信介政府的斗争，已经使岸信介处于孤立的地位。
    社论指出，岸信介和美帝国主义之间的军事勾结已经把日本置于战争威胁下，使日本变成进行军事挑衅的基地。这是日本人民所不能容忍的。
    “黎明日报”说，日本人民所以反对日美军事条约，是因为他们不愿意同中国和苏联作战，他们也不愿意看到美国在日本建立核武器基地和空军基地。
