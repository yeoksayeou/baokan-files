Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 14th: The remarks of a person in charge of the Japan Meteorological Agency prove that the US government's explanation that the U-2 aircraft stationed in Japan are used for meteorological work is a complete lie.

According to a report in the "Asahi Shimbun" today, Tada Hisao, Deputy Director of the Japan Meteorological Agency, told reporters from this newspaper yesterday that the Meteorological Agency has never received any meteorological information from U-2 aircraft. US government authorities have said that the work of the U-2 aircraft stationed in Japan is "limited to meteorological observation."

Tada pointed out that since the U-2 aircraft invaded the Soviet Union and caused problems, we now know that this type of aircraft has nothing to do with us (meteorological work).

"Asahi Shimbun" also reported today that the Japan Meteorological Society held a conference in Osaka on the 12th. Some members of the Kansai branch of this society jointly issued a statement at the meeting stating that, from the standpoint of meteorological workers, we do not believe that the US U-2 aircraft stationed in Japan are meteorological observation aircraft.

    日本气象厅次长揭穿美国政府谎言
    驻日U—2型飞机与气象工作不相干
    据新华社14日讯　东京消息：日本气象厅负责人的谈话证明，美国政府把美国派驻日本的U—2型飞机说成是用来进行气象工作的解释完全是谎话。
    据“朝日新闻”今天报道，日本气象厅次长多田寿夫昨天对这家报纸记者说，气象厅从来没有接到来自U—2型飞机的气象情报。美国政府当局曾经说，驻在日本的U—2型飞机的工作“只限于气象观测”。
    多田指出，由于U—2型飞机侵犯苏联惹起问题，现在我们知道了这一类飞机是与我们（气象工作）没有什么关系的。
    “朝日新闻”今天还报道，日本气象学会12日在大阪举行大会。这个学会关西分会的一部分会员在会上联合发表一项声明指出，从气象工作者立场来说，我们不认为驻在日本的美国U—2型飞机是气象观测飞机。
