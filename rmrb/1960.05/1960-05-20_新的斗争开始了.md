A New Struggle Begins
Commentator of this newspaper

Following the United States' unilateral destruction of the Four-Power Summit, the Japanese militarism represented by the Nobusuke Kishi group, in coordination with the US imperialists' criminal activities to intensify international tensions, disregarding the strong opposition of the vast majority of the Japanese people, the serious warnings from China and the Soviet Union, and the stern condemnation of world public opinion, on the 19th, brazenly mobilized police, the "Self-Defense Forces" and other fascist forces, expelling all members of the Japanese Socialist Party, Communist Party, and even the Democratic Socialist Party from the Diet, using the despicable means of a solo vote by the Liberal Democratic Party to forcibly "pass" the new US-Japan "Security Treaty" and a resolution to extend the Diet session by fifty days. According to the Japan Broadcasting Corporation, even during the Liberal Democratic Party's one-party vote, only a majority approved, indicating that there were still many patriotic people within the Liberal Democratic Party who disagreed with Nobusuke Kishi's unheard-of barbaric practices.

As of now, tens of thousands of Japanese people from all walks of life have stood in the rain outside the Japanese Diet, expressing their utmost indignation at Nobusuke Kishi's shameless ambush and this robber-like behavior, which has few precedents in the world, shouting "The Korean people overthrew Syngman Rhee, we will overthrow Nobusuke Kishi."

For more than a year, peace-loving Japanese people have persisted in their struggle to prevent the signing and ratification of the US-Japan military alliance treaty. Now, although Nobusuke Kishi has used the most shameless means to forcibly pass the new US-Japan "Security Treaty," the Japanese people's struggle will not be affected. On the contrary, the Japanese people's struggle against US imperialism and its running dogs will only develop further. In the past, it was the Japanese people's struggle to prevent the ratification of the new US-Japan "Security Treaty;" in the future, it will be the Japanese people's struggle to overthrow the US-Japan military alliance treaty. As Masuzo Akatsu, head of the Japan-China Friendship Association delegation currently visiting China, said, "The Japanese people, tempered by sixteen national unified action struggles, are no longer the Japanese people of the past." The Japanese people, who have launched a surging, nationwide storm of struggle, the Japanese people, who are determined to strive for an independent, peaceful, democratic, and neutral Japan, and the Japanese people, whose awareness is increasing day by day, will, after further recognizing the fascist militarist face of Nobusuke Kishi, continue to struggle with renewed vigor. We are deeply convinced of this. In the new struggle to overthrow the US-Japan military alliance treaty, the Japanese people will continue to receive the firm support of the Chinese people and the people of the world.

    新的斗争开始了
    本报评论员
    继美国一手破坏了四国首脑会议之后，以岸信介集团为代表的日本军国主义，策应美帝国主义加剧国际紧张局势的罪恶活动，甘冒天下之大不韪，竟不顾日本广大人民的强烈反对，不顾中国、苏联的严重警告以及世界公众舆论的严正谴责，19日悍然发动警察、“自卫队”等法西斯力量，将日本社会党、共产党、甚至于民主社会党的国会议员都全部驱逐出国会之外，以自由民主党单独表决的卑鄙手段强行“通过”新的日美“安全条约”和延长国会会期五十天的决议。根据日本广播电台透露，自由民主党一党表决的时候，也只是大多数赞成，可见得自由民主党内爱国有识之士也还有不少人是不同意岸信介的这一闻所未闻的野蛮做法的。
    截至现在为止，数以万计的日本各阶层群众冒雨伫立在日本国会外面，对于岸信介这样混水摸鱼的无耻的偷袭和世界上很少先例的这种强盗行径，表示万分愤慨，高呼“朝鲜人民推翻了李承晚，我们将推翻岸信介”。
    爱好和平的日本人民一年多来坚持进行了阻止签订和阻止批准日美军事同盟条约的斗争。现在尽管岸信介用最无耻的手段强行通过了新的日美“安全条约”，但是日本人民的斗争绝不会因此受到影响。相反的，日本人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争只会日益向前发展。过去，是日本人民阻止批准新的日美“安全条约”的斗争，今后，是日本人民推翻日美军事同盟条约的斗争。正在中国访问的日中友协代表团团长赤津益造说得好：“经过十六次全国统一行动斗争锻炼的日本人民再也不是过去的日本人民了。”掀起了汹涌澎湃、席卷全国的斗争风暴的日本人民，坚决争取独立、和平、民主、中立的日本人民，觉悟一天比一天提高的日本人民，在进一步认识清楚了岸信介的法西斯军国主义的面目之后，必将再接再厉地斗争下去。对此，我们是深信不疑的。日本人民在推翻日美军事同盟条约的新的斗争中，必将继续得到中国人民和全世界人民的坚决支持。
