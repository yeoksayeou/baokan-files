Xinhua News Agency, 15th Dispatch: As of today, over 12 million people in 33 cities and some county towns across the country have held unprecedented rallies and demonstrations to support the just struggle of the Japanese people against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. This unprecedented rally and demonstration fully expresses the firm determination of the 650 million Chinese people to oppose the U.S.-Japan reactionaries' conspiracy to plan a new war and to defend peace in Asia and the world. The thirty-three cities that held large-scale rallies and demonstrations are: Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Chongqing, Xi'an, Shenyang, Nanjing, Harbin, Changchun, Taiyuan, Chengdu, Hohhot, Urumqi, Lanzhou, Xining, Hefei, Zhengzhou, Hangzhou, Fuzhou, Changsha, Kunming, Guiyang, Jinan, Nanchang, Nanning, Lhasa, Yinchuan, Fushun, Luda, Qingdao, and Xiamen. After the capital held a large-scale demonstration of over one million people on the 9th, many factories, organizations, and schools also held rallies to support the just struggle of the Japanese people. Over 1.7 million people in Shanghai participated in demonstrations and rallies. In major cities such as Tianjin, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Chongqing, and Shenyang, the number of people participating in demonstrations and rallies all exceeded 600,000. The masses participating in the demonstrations included workers, farmers, women, intellectuals, militiamen, and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army from all ethnic groups in China, as well as people from all walks of life, including various democratic parties and religious circles. The vast number of Chinese people who had suffered from the atrocities of Japanese fascism, including farmers from Lugouqiao, survivors of the Nanjing Massacre, and victims who escaped from the piles of corpses in the "Ten Thousand People Pit," all flocked to participate in the demonstrations and rallies. They expressed that they would never allow U.S. imperialism to support the resurgence of Japanese militarism, and would never allow the U.S.-Japan reactionaries to subject the Chinese people to profound suffering again. They firmly opposed U.S. imperialism's revival of Japanese militarism and demanded that U.S. imperialism get out of Japan, get out of South Korea, get out of South Vietnam, get out of Turkey, get out of the Philippines, and get out of our territory of Taiwan. They called on the people of the world to unite and resolutely overthrow the common enemy of the people of the world, U.S. imperialism. The masses participating in the rallies and demonstrations in various places expressed deep sympathy and warm support for the Japanese people's opposition to the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty and their efforts to stop the U.S.-Japan reactionaries' conspiracy to plan a new war. They firmly believe that the Japanese people, the Chinese people, the people of socialist countries, and the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and all peace-loving people in the world are closely united and have the power to crush the war provocations of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries and drive U.S. imperialism back to its old home. The patriotic and just struggle of the Japanese people, the national democratic movements of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, will surely achieve final victory.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 15th Dispatch: The wave of Chinese people supporting the Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty is rising higher and higher. Today, in the heroic city of Shanghai, which has a glorious tradition of anti-imperialist struggle, more than 1.7 million people held a large-scale rally and demonstration. The slogans "Oppose the U.S.-Japan Military Alliance Treaty!" "Oppose the revival of Japanese militarism!" "U.S. Imperialism Get Out of Japan!" "The People of China and Japan Unite, the People of the World Unite, Down with U.S. Imperialism!" resounded throughout Shanghai.

Today, people from all walks of life in Shanghai held a massive rally centered on the People's Square in the city center, and factories, schools, organizations, and neighborhoods throughout the city also held rallies simultaneously. Starting at noon, powerful demonstration processions sang the song "Unity is Strength" and marched toward the square from all directions through Nanjing Road and Xizang Road. On Nanjing Road, red flags were like a forest, and shouts resounded like thunder. Thirty-five years ago, in May, Shanghai workers with bare hands shouted the slogan "Down with Imperialism" and engaged in bloody battles with imperialists here, setting off the world-shaking "May 30th" anti-imperialist struggle. The people of Shanghai, who have engaged in a long and heroic struggle against imperialism, are extremely angry at the U.S. imperialism's collusion with the Japanese reactionaries to plot a new war conspiracy, and express their full support for the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle. People issued firm voices: If imperialism dares to launch a war, we will send it to the grave early.

Today's People's Square has become an ocean of anger. Next to the towering rostrum, two huge banners, each 80 meters long, read "Oppose the Revival of Japanese Militarism" and "Oppose the U.S.-Japan Military Alliance Treaty," expressing the firm will of the people of Shanghai to fight against imperialism. The square and the surrounding roads were densely packed with demonstration crowds, and even the roads near the square and the stands of the stadium were filled with people. Armed militiamen, majestic and high-spirited, stood at the forefront of the crowd. In the square, tens of thousands of red flags fluttered in the wind, and people waved their fists, held up the placards in their hands, and shouted slogans continuously, like a surging and turbulent tide, one wave higher than another.

Ke Qingshi, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, First Secretary of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee, and Mayor of Shanghai, Cao Diqiu and Wei Wenbo, secretaries of the Secretariat of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee, Liu Shuzhou, alternate secretary of the Secretariat of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee and Deputy Mayor of Shanghai, Song Jiwen, Sheng Pihua, and Zhao Zukang, Deputy Mayors of Shanghai, Jin Zhonghua, Deputy Mayor of Shanghai and Chairman of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, Hu Juewen, Chen Wangdao, Shen Tilan, and Liu Jingji, Vice Chairmen of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPPCC, Lieutenant General Kang Zhiqiang and Major General Xiong Yingtang, leaders of the PLA garrison in Shanghai, responsible persons from various departments of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee and the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee, responsible persons from local organizations of various democratic parties and various people's organizations in Shanghai, as well as well-known figures from all walks of life, all attended today's conference.

All Japanese foreign guests in Shanghai participated in today's conference, including the Japanese-China Friendship Association delegation headed by Ekizo Akatsu, Takanosuke Minoru, vice chairman of the All-Japan Metal Workers' Union, and his wife, Japanese film director Kyogoku Takatoshi, and Japanese journalist Ito Takeo. Also attending the conference were foreign guests from more than 30 countries and regions currently visiting Shanghai, including: the Soviet Union, Albania, Bulgaria, the German Democratic Republic, Romania, Poland, Mongolia, Australia, Argentina, Algeria, the United Kingdom, Brazil, Burma, Ceylon, Chile, the Congo, Cyprus, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, France, Guinea, India, Italy, Cameroon, Morocco, Madagascar, the Mali Federation, New Zealand, Peru, Senegal, Somaliland, and Zanzibar. Consuls General and Consuls from various countries stationed in Shanghai also attended today's conference.

At 4 p.m., the Shanghai People's Conference to Support the Japanese People's Opposition to the U.S.-Japan Military Alliance Treaty began. The conference was presided over by Jin Zhonghua, Chairman of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace. In his speech, Jin Zhonghua expressed his firm support for the Japanese people's anti-imperialist patriotic struggle. He said: In order to enslave the Japanese people and the people of Asia, U.S. imperialism is using Japan as a base for aggression and a source of war, colluding with the traitorous Kishi Nobusuke government, and attempting to impose the disastrous U.S.-Japan military alliance on the Japanese people, which has aroused the unparalleled anger of the Japanese people, the Chinese people, the people of Asian countries, and the people of all countries in the world. We strongly condemn this sinister act of U.S. imperialism. He firmly stated: We regard the struggle of the Japanese people as our own struggle. In this struggle, the Chinese people stand entirely with the Japanese people. Let us unite closely and cooperate to completely smash the U.S.-Japan military alliance and overthrow our common enemy – U.S. imperialism.

Liu Shuzhou, alternate secretary of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee and Deputy Mayor of Shanghai, spoke amid warm applause. First, on behalf of the people of the city, he extended his heartfelt respect to the heroic, tenacious, and indomitable Japanese people who are resisting the U.S.-Japan reactionaries, and wished them greater victories in their struggle.

Liu Shuzhou said: The current development of the international situation is very favorable to the just struggle of the Japanese people. The East Wind has further prevailed over the West Wind. The imperialist colonial system is collapsing in large chunks. The entire imperialist camp is accelerating towards disintegration. U.S. imperialism is suffering extremely heavy blows everywhere. We believe that with the unanimous support of the people of the world, all patriotic forces of the Japanese people will unite more closely, persevere in their efforts, and persist in their struggle to the end, and will surely be able to defeat U.S. imperialism.

Liu Shuzhou's speech repeatedly aroused enthusiastic applause from hundreds of thousands of people in the square, and people raised their arms and shouted: "Down with U.S. Imperialism!" "U.S. Imperialism get out of Japan! Get out of South Korea! Get out of South Vietnam! Get out of Turkey ! Get out of the Phillipines! Get out of our territory Taiwan!" "People of the World, Unite!" At this time, the foreign guests participating in the conference, some used their native languages, and some used the Chinese language they had just learned, and shouted with the crowd.

People warmly applauded to welcome the speech of Japanese friends. Ekizo Akatsu, head of the visiting delegation of the Japan-China Friendship Association, expressed his gratitude for the Chinese people's support for their anti-imperialist patriotic and just struggle. Ekizo Akatsu said: Kishi Nobusuke was the culprit who launched the war of aggression against China and devastated Shanghai together with Tojo Hideki. Today, he shamelessly colludes with U.S. imperialism, as an accomplice in U.S. imperialism's war of aggression, and is frantically preparing to forcefully ratify the new "Security Treaty" in a conspiracy to launch a war of aggression against China, the Soviet Union, and Asian countries. However, the Japanese people of today have learned lessons from the disasters of imperialism and militarism they have suffered in the past. They are determined not to fight Asians again, and are determined to take courageous action to defend peace in Asia and the world.

Akatsu Ekizo said that the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and the Federation of Korean Trade Unions have issued a joint statement supporting the struggle of the people of Japan and South Korea, expressing their determination to drive U.S. imperialism out of the Western Pacific. We stand on the basis of the fraternal unity of the nations and people of Japan, China, Korea, and other Asian countries, and are determined to fight to the end to crush the U.S.-Japan military alliance.

Akatsu Ekizo finally shouted with the masses in the square: "Resolutely oppose the U.S.-Japan military alliance!" "U.S. imperialism get out of Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, and Asia!" "Long live the eternal friendship between the people of Japan and China!"

Subsequently, representatives of people's organizations and local organizations of democratic parties in Shanghai, as well as representatives of workers, farmers, students, and neighborhood residents, all spoke at the meeting.

Zhong Min, chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, said in his speech on behalf of all Shanghai workers that Shanghai workers in the past suffered deeply from the disasters caused by imperialist aggression. We have long recognized from our long revolutionary struggle that U.S. imperialism is the mortal enemy of the Chinese people and the people of the world. We cannot have any illusions about Eisenhower and U.S. imperialism. Only by resolutely rising up to fight can we maintain peace. We, the working class of Shanghai, firmly stand on the side of the Japanese working class and the Japanese people, on the side of the people of South Korea and Turkey, and on the side of the people all over the world who are fighting against U.S. imperialism.

The workers and farmers of Shanghai will never forget the bloody feud with Japanese militarism and U.S. imperialism. They know best that to strive for a peaceful and happy life, they must unite and carry out a resolute struggle to defeat U.S. imperialism. The elder sister and brother of Han Xinliang, a famous steel worker at Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3, were both killed by Japanese fascist bandits. His brother, in order to avenge them, once cut off the ear of a Japanese commander with an ax. Today he angrily said at the meeting: "We will never forgive the towering crimes of the imperialists." He said: "The struggle of the heroic Japanese workers is our struggle, U.S. imperialism is our common enemy, let us, the working classes of China and Japan, unite to smash the U.S.-Japan military alliance and fight to the end to defeat the U.S.-Japan reactionaries!"

Jin Dejun, deputy director of the Luodian People's Commune, said in his speech: "Whenever people mention Japanese militarism and U.S. imperialism, everyone will grit their teeth and think of the monstrous crimes they committed in China in the past." In Zhao Xiang Street, Luodian Town, Baoshan County, the hometown of this farmer, 70% of the houses were burned down during the "August 13th" incident in 1937, and sixty-eight farmers were brutally killed, and five families were killed. He angrily said at the meeting: "We will never forget the blood debts owed by Japanese militarism. Now U.S. imperialism is colluding with Japanese reactionaries and opposing our Chinese people, the Soviet people, and the people of the world, using the Japanese people as cannon fodder. This criminal act further proves that the American robbers are the most ferocious enemies of the people of the world. To deal with this kind of aggression, we must rely on the people of all countries to unite, thoroughly expose it, and resolutely carry out the struggle. We, the 650 million Chinese people, vow to be the backing of the Japanese people, and the struggle of the Japanese people will surely be victorious!"

Li Qitao, secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, Guo Jian, director of the Shanghai Women's Federation, Zhao Zukang, chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and representative of the democratic parties in Shanghai, and Sheng Pihua, chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce, all expressed their firm support for the Japanese people's anti-imperialist patriotic and just struggle in their speeches, strongly criticizing U.S. imperialism's conspiracy to collude with Japanese reactionaries to plot a new war, and expressing their determination to stand firmly with the Japanese people, the Asian people, and all the oppressed people of the world to resolutely fight to defend peace in Asia and the world.

Officers and soldiers of the Army, Navy, and Air Force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai also participated in today's rally and demonstration. Among the fully armed militiamen, one was Hao Lixiang, an old Red Guard member who participated in the Shanghai workers' three armed uprisings more than 30 years ago. He said that U.S. imperialism wants to revive Japanese militarism and vainly attempt to enslave the people of the world. We will never agree to it. We stand with the Japanese people and all the oppressed people of the world and will fight to the final victory.

The foreign guests from many countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America who participated in today's conference were very excited. They believed that this conference was not only a support for the Japanese people, but also a support for all the oppressed people in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Mudongbe Edward-Waranjin, head of the trade union delegation of the Congo, told reporters: Whether in Asia, Africa, or Latin America, the common will of the people is to defeat U.S. imperialism. Today's conference has added new strength to our struggle, and we will bring the warm support of the Chinese people back to the Congo. I am confident that one day the people of the world will rise up from all corners to defeat U.S. imperialism. Meng Antoana, head of the trade union delegation of Cameroon, said: Today's conference further confirms that the struggles of the working classes of all countries are not isolated. The powerful Chinese people are a powerful pillar of the anti-imperialist struggle of all oppressed nations. Imperialism has reached the verge of death. We have prepared coffins and dug graves for imperialism. Now we need to unite better, put the corpse of imperialism into the coffin, and bury it completely.

The conference ended in a burst of impassioned slogans. At this time, colorful balloons hung with huge banners rose into the sky above the square. Hundreds of thousands of people sang the song "Unity is Strength" in unison, one time after another. The foreign friends on the rostrum also clapped along with everyone, echoing. This song showed the determination and strength of the people of the world to unite and oppose imperialism. It was broadcast live to every corner of the city.

The conference finally adopted a telegram to the Osaka Prefectural People's Conference for Security Struggle in Osaka, Japan.

After the meeting, the masses, with great excitement, set off from the People's Square in more than a dozen routes and held a demonstration parade.

    据新华社上海15日电　中国人民支援日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争浪潮愈来愈高。今天，在具有反帝斗争光荣传统的英雄城市上海，有一百七十多万人举行了大规模的集会和示威游行。“反对日美军事同盟条约！”“反对复活日本军国主义！”“美帝国主义从日本滚出去！”“中日两国人民团结起来，全世界人民团结起来，打倒美帝国主义！”的口号声，震彻整个上海。
    今天，上海各界人民，以市中心的人民广场为中心举行声势浩大的集会，全市工厂、学校、机关、里弄也同时集会。从中午开始，强大的示威游行队伍高唱着“团结就是力量”的歌曲，通过南京路、西藏路一带，从四面八方向广场进发。南京路上，红旗如林，呼声雷动。三十五年前的5月，赤手空拳的上海工人就曾经喊出“打倒帝国主义”的口号，在这里和帝国主义者展开浴血搏斗，掀起了震撼世界的“五卅”反帝斗争。和帝国主义进行过长期英勇斗争的上海人民，对美帝国主义勾结日本反动派策划新战争阴谋，感到无比愤怒，对日本人民的爱国正义斗争表示全力支持。人们发出坚定的声音：帝国主义胆敢发动战争，我们就提早把它送进坟墓。
    今天的人民广场，成了一片愤怒的海洋。巍峨的主席台旁边，两幅各长八十米的巨幅标语上，写着“反对复活日本军国主义”、“反对日美军事同盟条约”二十个大字，表达了全上海市人民反帝斗争的坚强意志。广场和周围马路上，密密层层地排列着示威群众的队伍，连广场附近的马路上和体育馆看台上也站满了人群。武装的民兵，雄赳赳、气昂昂，站在群众队伍的最前列。广场上，千万面红旗迎风飘扬，人们挥着拳头，高举手中的标语牌，接连地呼着口号，像汹涌澎湃的怒潮，一浪高过一浪。
    中共中央政治局委员、中共上海市委第一书记、上海市市长柯庆施，中共上海市委书记处书记曹荻秋、魏文伯，中共上海市委书记处候补书记、上海市副市长刘述周，上海市副市长宋季文、盛丕华、赵祖康，上海市副市长、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会上海市分会主席金仲华，政协上海市委副主席胡厥文、陈望道、沈体兰、刘靖基，中国人民解放军驻上海部队首长康志强中将、熊应堂少将，中共上海市委和上海市人民委员会各部门的负责人，各民主党派上海地方组织和各人民团体的负责人，以及各界著名人士等，都出席了今天的大会。
    所有在上海的日本外宾都参加了今天的大会，他们当中有，以赤津益造为首的日本中国友好协会访华代表团，日本全国金属劳动组合副委员长高野实和夫人，日本电影编导京极高英，日本新闻界人士伊藤武雄等。参加大会的还有正在上海访问的三十多个国家和地区的外宾，他们是：苏联、阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、德意志民主共和国、罗马尼亚、波兰、蒙古、澳大利亚、阿根廷、阿尔及利亚、英国、巴西、缅甸、锡兰、智利、刚果、塞浦路斯、哥伦比亚、哥斯达黎加、厄瓜多尔、法国、几内亚、印度、意大利、喀麦隆、摩洛哥、马达加斯加、马里联邦、新西兰、秘鲁、塞内加尔、索马里兰、桑给巴尔等。出席今天大会的还有各国驻上海总领事和领事。
    下午四时，上海市各界人民支援日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约大会开始。大会由中国人民保卫世界和平委员会上海市分会主席金仲华主持。金仲华在讲话中表示坚决支持日本人民的反帝爱国斗争。他说：美帝国主义为了奴役日本人民和亚洲人民，把日本作为侵略基地和战争策源地，勾结岸信介卖国政府，企图把灾难性的日美军事同盟强加在日本人民身上，这已经激起了日本人民、中国人民、亚洲各国人民以及世界各国人民的无比愤怒。我们严厉谴责美帝国主义这种罪恶的勾当。他坚决表示：我们把日本人民的斗争，当作自己的斗争一样。在这一场斗争中，中国人民和日本人民完全站在一起。让我们紧密团结合作，彻底粉碎日美军事同盟，打倒我们共同的敌人——美帝国主义。
    中共上海市委书记处候补书记、上海市副市长刘述周在热烈的掌声中讲话，他首先代表全市人民向英勇顽强、不屈不挠地反抗美日反动派的日本人民致以衷心的敬意，并祝他们在斗争中取得更大的胜利。
    刘述周说：目前国际形势的发展，十分有利于日本人民的正义斗争。东风已经进一步压倒西风。帝国主义殖民体系正在一大块一大块地崩溃下去。整个帝国主义阵营正在加速地走向四分五裂。美帝国主义到处受到极其沉重的打击。我们相信，在全世界人民一致支持之下，日本人民的一切爱国力量更紧密地团结起来，再接再厉，坚持斗争到底，一定能够打倒美帝国主义。
    刘述周的讲话一次又一次地激起了广场上几十万群众热烈的掌声，人们振臂高呼：“打倒美帝国主义！”“美帝国主义从日本滚出去！从南朝鲜滚出去！从南越滚出去！从土耳其滚出去！从菲律宾滚出去！从我国领土台湾滚出去！”“全世界人民团结起来！”这时，参加大会的各国外宾，他们有的用本国语言，也有的用刚学会的中国话和群众一起高呼。
    人们热烈鼓掌欢迎日本友人讲话。日中友好协会访华代表团团长赤津益造在讲话中，表示感谢中国人民对他们反帝爱国正义斗争的支持。赤津益造说：岸信介是和东条英机一起发动侵华战争和蹂躏上海市的祸手。今天，他又无耻地勾结美帝国主义，作为美帝国主义侵略战争的帮凶，阴谋对中国、苏联以及亚洲各国发动侵略战争，正在疯狂地准备强行批准新“安全条约”。但是，今天的日本人民，已经从过去所受到的帝国主义和军国主义的灾难中吸取了教训，他们坚决不再和亚洲人作战，并决心为保卫亚洲和世界和平而勇敢地行动起来。
  赤津益造说，日本工会总评议会、中华全国总工会和朝鲜职业总同盟发表了联合声明，支持日本和南朝鲜人民的斗争，表示决心要把美帝国主义从西太平洋赶出去。我们站在日本、中国、朝鲜以及亚洲各国民族和人民的战友般的团结的基础上，决心为粉碎日美军事同盟而斗争到底。
    赤津益造最后和广场上的群众一起高呼：“坚决反对日美军事同盟！”“美帝国主义从日本、台湾、南朝鲜、亚洲滚出去！”“日中两国人民的永恒的友谊万岁！”
    接着，上海市的各人民团体、各民主党派地方组织的代表，以及工人、农民、学生、里弄居民的代表，都在大会上讲了话。
    上海市总工会主席钟民代表全上海职工在讲话中说，上海工人过去受尽了帝国主义侵略造成的深重灾难。我们从长期的革命斗争中，早就认清了美帝国主义是中国人民和全世界人民的死敌。对艾森豪威尔和美帝国主义不能存有任何幻想，只有坚决起来斗争，才能维护和平。我们上海工人阶级坚决站在日本工人阶级和日本人民一边，站在南朝鲜人民、土耳其人民一边，站在全世界同美帝国主义斗争的人民一边。
    上海的工人、农民永远忘不了同日本军国主义和美帝国主义结下的血海深仇，他们最懂得要争取和平幸福的生活，只有团结起来进行坚决的斗争，打倒美帝国主义。上钢三厂著名钢铁工人韩忻亮的姐姐、哥哥都是被日本法西斯强盗杀害的，哥哥为了报仇，曾用斧头砍了日本司令官的耳朵。今天他在会上愤怒地说：“我们决不会饶恕帝国主义者的滔天罪行。”他说：“英勇的日本工人的斗争就是我们的斗争，美帝国主义是我们共同的敌人，让我们中日两国工人阶级团结起来，为粉碎日美军事同盟，为打倒美日反动派而斗争到底！”
    罗店人民公社副主任金德俊在讲话中说：“一提起日本军国主义和美帝国主义，人人就会咬牙切齿地想到它过去在中国犯下的滔天罪行。”这个农民的家乡宝山县罗店镇赵巷街，在1937年“八一三”时，全街70％的房屋都被烧掉了，有六十八个农民惨遭杀害，有五户人家全家被杀害。他在会上愤怒地说：“日本军国主义欠下的血债，我们永远不会忘记。现在美帝国主义勾结日本反动派，同我们中国人民、苏联人民和全世界人民作对头，把日本人民充当炮灰，这种罪恶行为更加证明美国强盗是全世界人民最凶恶的敌人。对待这种侵略行为，就要靠各国人民联合起来，彻底揭穿它，坚决进行斗争。我们六亿五千万中国人民誓作日本人民的后盾，日本人民的斗争一定会胜利！”
    共青团上海市委书记李琦涛，上海市妇女联合会主任郭建，民革上海市委主任委员、上海市各民主党派代表赵祖康，上海市工商联主任委员盛丕华等，都在讲话中表示坚决支持日本人民的反帝爱国正义斗争，强烈指斥美帝国主义勾结日本反动派策划新战争的阴谋，表示坚决和日本人民、亚洲人民和全世界一切被压迫人民在一起，为保卫亚洲和世界和平而坚决斗争。
    中国人民解放军驻上海陆、海、空三军的官兵，也参加今天的集会示威。在全副武装的民兵队伍中，有一位是三十多年前参加上海工人三次武装起义的老赤卫队员郝立祥，他说，美帝国主义想复活日本军国主义，妄想奴役全世界人民，我们绝不答应。我们和日本人民和全世界一切被压迫人民站在一起，一直斗争到最后胜利。
    参加今天大会的亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲许多国家的外宾们，情绪非常激动，他们认为这个大会不仅是对日本人民的支持，也是对亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲一切被压迫人民的支持。刚果工会代表团团长穆东伯·爱德华—瓦郎丁对记者说：不论亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲，人民的共同意志是打倒美帝国主义。今天的大会给我们的斗争增加了新的力量，我们将把中国人民的热烈支援带回刚果去。我满怀信心地认为，总有一天世界人民会从各个角落起来把美帝国主义打倒。喀麦隆工会代表团团长蒙·安托阿纳说：今天的大会进一步证实了各国工人阶级的斗争都不是孤立的，强大的中国人民是一切被压迫民族反帝斗争的有力支柱。帝国主义已经到了垂死的边缘，我们已经为帝国主义做好棺材，挖好了墓坑，现在需要我们更好地团结起来，把帝国主义这具死尸装进棺材，彻底埋葬掉。
    大会在一片激昂的口号声中结束。这时，广场上空升起了挂着巨幅标语的彩色气球。几十万群众同声唱起了“团结就是力量”的歌曲，一遍接着一遍。主席台上的外国朋友们也和大家一起打起拍子，应声和着。这歌声显示了全世界人民团结一致反对帝国主义的决心和力量。它通过实况广播传到了全市每个角落。
    大会最后通过了致日本大阪市安保共斗大阪府民会议的通电。
    会后，群众以万分激奋的心情，分十几路由人民广场出发，举行了示威大游行。
