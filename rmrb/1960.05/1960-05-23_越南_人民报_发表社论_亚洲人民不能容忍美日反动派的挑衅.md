Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 22nd: Vietnam's "People's Daily" today published an editorial entitled "Resolutely Chop Off the Claws of American Imperialism and Japanese Militarism," severely condemning the Kishi Nobusuke group's action of using violence to force the Japanese House of Representatives to "pass" the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.

The editorial pointed out that the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty is an important part of the entire war and aggression plan of U.S. imperialism. The signing and "passage" of this treaty are inseparable from the war preparations of U.S. imperialism and are inseparable from the actions of U.S. imperialism in undermining the four-power summit conference.

The editorial said that the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty first and foremost seriously threatens the lives of 90 million Japanese people. The Japanese people were once victims of American atomic bombs, and the Japanese people will never allow U.S. imperialism to turn Japan into a battlefield for atomic war.

The editorial also pointed out that the new U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty threatens the peace and tranquility of Asia and the independence of Asian countries. This is a blatant act of provocation by the American imperialists and the Japanese militarist group against the people of Asian countries. The people of Asia will never allow such actions.

The editorial said that the Vietnamese people strongly condemn the new U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and resolutely stand side by side with the Japanese people and the people of the world, further launching the struggle to smash all the war conspiracies of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, thereby safeguarding peace in Asia and the world.

    亚洲人民不能容忍美日反动派的挑衅
    新华社河内22日电　越南“人民报”今天发表题为“坚决斩断美帝国主义和日本军国主义的魔掌”的社论，严厉谴责岸信介集团用暴力强使日本众议院“通过”日美军事同盟条约的行动。
    社论指出，日美军事同盟条约是美帝国主义全部战争和侵略计划中的重要部分。这个条约的签订和“通过”是同美帝国主义的备战行动分不开的，是同美帝国主义破坏四国首脑会议的行动分不开的。
    社论说，日美军事同盟条约首先严重威胁了九千万日本人民的生活。日本人民曾经是美国原子弹的受害者，日本人民决不会容许美帝国主义把日本变成原子战争的战场。
    社论还指出，新的日美军事同盟条约威胁亚洲的和平和安宁以及亚洲各国的独立，这是美帝国主义和日本军国主义集团对亚洲各国人民的明目张胆的挑衅行动。亚洲人民绝不容许这种行动。
    社论说，越南人民强烈谴责新的日美军事同盟条约，坚决同日本人民和世界人民并肩站在一起，进一步展开斗争，粉碎美帝国主义及其走狗的一切战争阴谋，从而保卫亚洲和世界和平。
