Xinhua News Agency, May 18th. TASS, Paris, May 17th: Agence France-Presse excerpted the speech given by French President De Gaulle on May 16th at the preliminary meeting of the Four-Power Heads of Government Conference in Paris.

    General De Gaulle, in speaking about the incident of the American plane conducting espionage flights over Soviet airspace, acknowledged that the international situation "is now more tense than ever due to the aforementioned incident." However, in reality, De Gaulle was actually urging the Soviet delegation to abandon its principled stance. De Gaulle demanded that people view the American act of aggression as a "purely local incident" and demanded that the meeting begin.

    President De Gaulle cited Eisenhower's vague promise to halt American reconnaissance flights.

Xinhua News Agency, May 18th. According to TASS, Paris, May 17th: British Prime Minister Macmillan, speaking at the preliminary meeting of the Four-Power Heads of Government Conference in Paris, said that he "fully understood" the "mood" caused by the American plane conducting espionage flights in Soviet airspace. He acknowledged "the weight of Mr. Khrushchev's arguments." However, the British Prime Minister evaded discussing the American act of aggression and, in effect, demanded that the Soviet delegation abandon its principled and frank stance, and advocated starting the meeting.
