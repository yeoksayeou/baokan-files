Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 21st - Two million people from all walks of life in Tianjin held a massive demonstration and rally today, resolutely supporting the Soviet Union's just stance and severely condemning US imperialism for undermining the Four-Power Summit.

During this city-wide demonstration, along the more than 100-li-long Hai River, from the Xingang Pier on the Bohai Bay to the suburban People's Communes, long lines formed countless demonstration teams, flocking to the central venue and other venues from all directions. They waved red flags, held high banners and cartoon signs, and constantly raised their arms and shouted slogans, the roars condemning US imperialism like the angry waves of the Bohai Sea. Qian Jiaguang, deputy director of the Tianjin Textile Machinery Factory, who had studied at the Tashkent Textile Machinery Factory in the Soviet Union, had been unable to suppress the anger in his heart for several days since hearing the news that US imperialism had used spy planes to invade the Soviet Union. When participating in the rally today, this worker-turned-deputy director said angrily: US imperialism should not miscalculate. The Chinese people will always stand on the side of the Soviet big brother. If imperialism is blinded by its ambitions, let it taste the iron fists of the Chinese and Soviet people. Chen Xitong, an elderly man in his sixties who has a flesh-and-blood relationship with the Soviet people, is a retired Chinese worker who participated in the October Revolution in the Soviet Union. He said angrily: If US imperialism dares to move an inch of Soviet soil, we will smash its dog head. Shi Bo, a demobilized soldier of the Volunteer Army, had personally witnessed the embarrassing appearance of groups of American invading troops being captured on the Korean battlefield. He said to the surrounding masses that US imperialism is a paper tiger that looks strong but is weak inside. If it does not learn from the lesson of its defeat in the war against Korea and dares to launch a war of aggression, its doomsday will come.

Leading members of the Hebei Provincial and Tianjin Municipal Party and government, responsible persons of local organizations of democratic parties and people's organizations all attended the mass rally at the central venue. More than 40,000 people gathered at the central venue.

Soviet experts and Polish staff working in Tianjin also participated in the mass rally at the central venue.

After the meeting began, Liu Zihou, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke first. He represented the 43 million people of Hebei Province, expressing his firm support for the Soviet government's solemn position on the Four-Power Summit and expressing great indignation at US imperialism's acts of aggression and provocation against the Soviet Union. He pointed out that US imperialism's undermining of the Four-Power Summit was by no means accidental. It is a continuation of the United States' long-standing pursuit of a policy of aggression and a policy of war. While feigning peace, US imperialism has never ceased its frantic arms expansion and war preparations. The Soviet Union's just struggle against American aggression and provocation is a heavy blow to US imperialism and inspires peace-loving people all over the world. Liu Zihou said that the inherently aggressive US imperialism will not automatically abandon its policy of aggression. We must heighten our vigilance, hold high the banner of anti-imperialism, exert greater efforts, accelerate socialist construction, strengthen the strength of the socialist camp, and strive to thoroughly defeat the war and aggression policies of US imperialism and win lasting world peace.

Subsequently, Yang Yizhou, representative of local organizations of democratic parties in Hebei Province, Zhang Guofan, vice chairman of the Tianjin Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, Yu Zhiyuan, representative of people's organizations in Hebei Province, and representatives of workers and farmers all spoke at the meeting. They unanimously and severely condemned the aggressive crimes of US imperialism and expressed that the Chinese people will always stand with the Soviet people and fight to the end to smash the war plots of US imperialism.

Their speeches repeatedly aroused enthusiastic applause and slogans from the demonstrating masses. From the central venue to other venues, from the demonstrating crowds along the way to the two million men, women, old and young who listened to the radio, everywhere shouted: "People of the world unite and overthrow US imperialism!"

    完全支持苏联反对美国侵略和挑衅的正义斗争
    谴责美帝国主义的吼声有如渤海怒涛
    天津二百万人集会示威
    新华社天津21日电　天津市各界人民二百万人今天举行声势浩大的示威和集会，坚决支持苏联的正义立场，严厉谴责美帝国主义破坏四国首脑会议。
    在这次倾城的示威游行中，沿着长达一百多里的海河两岸，从渤海湾上的新港码头直到边缘的城郊人民公社，长长的行列结成无数的示威队伍，从四面八方涌向中心会场和其他各个会场。他们沿途挥舞着红旗，高举着标语牌和漫画牌，不断振臂高呼口号，谴责美帝国主义的吼声有如渤海怒涛。曾在苏联塔什干纺织机械厂学习过的天津市纺织机械厂副厂长钱嘉光，自从听到美帝国主义用间谍飞机对苏联进行侵略的消息以后，几天以来一直压不住心头的怒火。今天参加集会的时候，这位工人出身的副厂长愤怒地说：美帝国主义不要打错算盘，中国人民永远是站在苏联老大哥这一边的，如果帝国主义冲昏头脑，就叫它尝尝中苏两国人民的铁拳。和苏联人民有着血肉关系的年过花甲的老人陈锡同，是参加过苏联十月革命的中国退休老工人，他愤怒地说：美帝国主义敢动苏联一寸土地，我们就砸碎它的狗头。志愿军复员军人史博，在朝鲜战场上曾亲眼看过成群结队的美国侵略军被俘后的狼狈像。他对周围的群众说，美帝国主义是个外强中干的纸老虎，如果它还不接受侵朝战争失败的教训，胆敢发动侵略战争，就是它的末日到了。
    河北省和天津市党政负责人，各民主党派地方组织、人民团体的负责人，都出席了中心会场的群众集会。在中心会场集会的群众共四万多人。
    在天津工作的苏联专家、波兰工作人员也都参加了中心会场的群众集会。
    大会开始后，中共河北省委书记处书记刘子厚首先讲话。他代表河北省四千三百万人民，表示坚决支持苏联政府对四国首脑会议采取的严正立场，对美帝国主义对苏联的侵略和挑衅行为表示极大的愤慨。他指出，美帝国主义破坏四国首脑会议绝不是偶然的，这是美国长期以来奉行侵略政策和战争政策的继续。美帝国主义伪装和平的同时，从来就没有停止过疯狂的扩军备战活动。苏联反对美国侵略和挑衅的正义斗争，对美帝国主义是一次沉重的打击，鼓舞了全世界爱好和平的人民。刘子厚说，侵略成性的美帝国主义不会自动放弃它的侵略政策，我们必须提高警惕，高举反对帝国主义旗帜，鼓足更大干劲，加速社会主义建设，加强社会主义阵营的力量，为彻底击败美帝国主义的战争和侵略政策、争取世界持久和平而奋斗到底。
    接着，各民主党派河北省地方组织代表杨亦周，中国人民保卫世界和平委员会天津市分会副主席张国藩，河北省人民团体代表于致远，和工人、农民代表等都在大会上讲了话。他们一致严厉谴责美帝国主义的侵略罪行，并表示中国人民永远和苏联人民一起，为粉碎美帝国主义的战争阴谋斗争到底。
    他们的讲话，都一再激起了示威群众的热烈掌声和口号声。从中心会场到其他各个会场，从沿途的示威人群到收听广播的二百万男女老少，到处高呼：“全世界人民团结起来，打倒美帝国主义！”
