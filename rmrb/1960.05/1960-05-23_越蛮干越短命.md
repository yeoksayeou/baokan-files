    The More Reckless You Are, the Shorter Your Life
    Yang Zijang
    Japanese traitor Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, disregarding the resolute opposition of the broad masses of Japanese people, disregarding the warnings of China, the Soviet Union, and peace-loving people all over the world, brazenly used police to drive away opposition party members and other violent methods to "pass" the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty in the House of Representatives. Such brutality is hard to describe even with the words "despicable and shameless"; such brutality is the greatest irony and a thorough exposure of the so-called "parliamentary democracy" of the bourgeoisie; such brutality is the most thorough exposure of the fascist face of the Kishi Nobusuke group. Perhaps Kishi Nobusuke thinks that this treaty has already been "passed," but the Japanese people will never let it pass. Even the right-wing Democratic Socialist Party believes that this kind of "passage" is invalid, and even more than thirty members of the ruling party are unwilling to let it "stain their hands." Kishi Nobusuke's shamelessness has made him an even more outstanding negative teacher for the Japanese people, better educating the people, making more people aware, and joining the struggle to overthrow Kishi Nobusuke and oppose the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, accelerating the demise of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries. The Japanese Communist Party is absolutely right in saying: "The struggle has only just begun." A new struggle, larger in scale than before, has already begun in Japan. Syngman Rhee used every fascist means in the election, and he thought he was elected, but what was the result? Bad things can always be turned into good things. The more recklessly the reactionaries act, the more intense the people's struggle will be, and the shorter their lifespan will be. This is an unshakable law. Kishi Nobusuke cannot escape this law either.

    越蛮干越短命
    杨子江
    日本卖国首相岸信介，不顾广大日本人民的坚决反对，不顾中国、苏联和全世界爱好和平人民的警告，悍然用警察赶走在野党议员的强暴手法，在众议院自己“通过”了日美军事同盟条约。这种暴行，即使用“卑鄙无耻”的字眼，也难以形容其万一；这种暴行，是对资产阶级所谓“议会民主”的最大讽刺和再一次彻底的暴露；这种暴行，是岸信介集团法西斯面目的最彻底的暴露。也许岸信介自以为这个条约已经“通过”了，可是日本人民是永远不会让它通过的，就连右翼政党民主社会党也认为这种
  “通过”无效，甚至连执政党内也有三十多位议员，不愿让它“沾污他们的手”。岸信介的无耻，使自己比过去更加出色地担任了日本人民的反面教员，更好地教育了人民，使更多的人觉悟过来，参加打倒岸信介，反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争，加速美日反动派的灭亡。日本共产党说得完全正确：“斗争现在还刚开始。”一个新的规模比前更壮阔的斗争已经在日本开始了。李承晚在选举中，就是用尽了法西斯手法的，他自以为当选了，然而结果如何呢？坏事总是可以变成好事的。反动派越是蛮干，越激起人民更剧烈的斗争，他们的寿命也就越短，这是不可动摇的规律。岸信介也逃不脱这条规律的。
