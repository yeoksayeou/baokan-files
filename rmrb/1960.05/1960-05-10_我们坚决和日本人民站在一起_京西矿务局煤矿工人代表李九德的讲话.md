Comrades:
    I am a coal miner, and I am very angry to hear that the US-Japanese reactionaries have concluded the US-Japan military alliance treaty and are plotting a new war. The Japanese people have launched a large-scale and heroic struggle against the US-Japan military alliance treaty. Japanese workers are at the forefront of this struggle. We Chinese workers firmly support their just struggle!
    Chinese workers are now the masters of their own house, but we will never forget how the imperialists oppressed and exploited us in the past, drinking our blood and eating our flesh. Today, US imperialism and Japanese reactionaries are colluding again, concluding a military alliance, wanting to repeat the old path, wanting to plunge the Japanese people, the Chinese people, and the Asian people back into the abyss. We will never allow it. Eisenhower and Kishi Nobusuke, you villains, are running amok everywhere, antagonizing the people. The iron fists of the people will surely smash you to pieces! We will never be satisfied until the US-Japanese reactionaries are overthrown!
    Brave Japanese people, your struggle is our struggle. You are not isolated. The 650 million Chinese people pledge to be your backing. We will always stand on your side. The US-Japanese reactionaries will surely fail, and the Japanese people will surely win!
    US imperialism get out of Japan! Get out of South Korea! Get out of South Vietnam! Get out of the Philippines! Get out of Turkey! Get out of our territory Taiwan!
    The people of China and Japan unite, the people of the world unite, and overthrow US imperialism!

    我们坚决和日本人民站在一起
    京西矿务局煤矿工人代表李九德的讲话同志们：
    我是一个煤矿工人，听到美日反动派缔结日美军事同盟条约，策划新战争的阴谋，非常气愤。日本人民展开了大规模的反对日美军事同盟条约的英勇斗争，日本工人站在这个斗争的最前线，我们中国工人坚决支持他们的正义斗争！
    中国工人现在当家做主了，但是，我们绝不忘记过去帝国主义压迫我们，剥削我们，他们喝我们的血，吃我们的肉。今天美帝国主义和日本反动派又勾结起来，订立军事同盟，想走过去的老路，想把日本人民、中国人民和亚洲人民重新推入火坑，我们绝不答应。艾森豪威尔、岸信介，你们这些坏蛋，到处横行霸道，与人民为敌，人民的铁拳一定要把你们打得粉碎！不把美日反动派打倒，我们绝不甘心！
    英勇的日本人民，你们的斗争就是我们的斗争，你们决不是孤立的，六亿五千万中国人民誓作你们的后盾，我们永远站在你们这一边。美日反动派，一定要失败，日本人民一定要胜利！
    美帝国主义从日本滚出去！从南朝鲜滚出去！从南越滚出去！从菲律宾滚出去！从土耳其滚出去！从我国领土台湾滚出去！
    中日两国人民团结起来，全世界人民团结起来，打倒美帝国主义！
