Notebook of the Party Secretary:

The Commune Party School Blossoms
Yang Yurong, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Linchuan County Committee, Jiangxi

The Commune Party Committee runs the Party School, effectively training cadres;
Combining study with labor, theory is closely linked to practice;
Delving into principles and policies, improving thought brings drive;
Thanks to the well-run Party School, heartfelt gratitude to the Party leadership.

This clapper rhyme speaks to the benefits of running a Party School in the commune, and also truly reflects the excitement of the broad masses of grassroots cadres after receiving improvement through study. Like other places in Linchuan County, various construction endeavors are developing by leaps and bounds. This requires the broad masses of grassroots cadres to rapidly improve their political and theoretical levels, as well as their cultural level, and the broad masses of grassroots cadres also have a strong desire for knowledge.

"When one flag is held high, ten thousand flags fly," in the first spring after the people's communes were established, commune-run Party Schools sprung up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. In the past year, all twenty-six communes in the county have successively run one hundred and eight Party Schools, training more than twelve thousand rural grassroots cadres and activists, achieving a bumper harvest in ideology, work, and production. If these cadres had to wait for the County Party School to train them, it would only happen once every five or six years.

At the beginning of the establishment of commune-run Party Schools, most communes had no teachers or full-time cadres, and no funds or equipment, with many difficulties. What to do? If there were no teachers, the Party Committee Secretary would take on the role; if there were no full-time cadres, a portion of full-time and part-time leading backbone members would be drawn from production brigades or organizations and enterprises for each term to participate in learning and lead the learning, being both students and staff members of the Party School; if there were no classrooms, they would squeeze in and use vacant houses and houses that could be vacated as classrooms; if there were no funds, they would find ways to solve the problem by adopting the method of part-work and part-study; if there was no experience, they would explore in practice.

"Once theory has gripped the masses, it immediately becomes a tremendous material force." This truth expounded by Marx has been most vividly confirmed in the work of our commune-run Party Schools. After studying at the Party School, cadres greatly improved their political consciousness and theoretical level, and improved their work style. Just as the students said:

Fifteen days of study at school, is better than a whole year of reading.

The commune Party School, based on the characteristics of various regions and the different situations of various periods, started from the Party's political movements and central tasks in various periods, flexibly and properly arranged the content of learning, and vigorously promoted production and various tasks. Students from Hunan Commune, through study, recognized the importance of increasing production and the theory of continuous revolution, and after returning, actively devoted themselves to the movement of accumulating and producing fertilizer. The Taiyang Commune Party School successively ran three training courses at the construction site, training 472 grassroots cadres and activists, vigorously promoting tool reform and high work efficiency movement, with an average increase in work efficiency of three times, becoming a red flag in water conservancy construction in the entire special district.

The Commune Party School is a product of the people's commune, and it has only been around for a year, but in this short year it has shown its great superiority. It is not only a classroom for learning theory and improving thought, but also a good place for exchanging work experience. This new type of red school is a good place for spreading Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works. In this red school all over the place, it has cultivated thousands of socialist construction talents, and has continuously provided a solid grassroots leadership backbone for continued leaps forward, and has supplied new blood for the hot socialist construction cause.

### 公社党校开红花

    公社党校开红花
    中共江西临川县委副书记　杨裕隆
    公社党委办党校，培养干部效果高；
    学习劳动齐结合，理论实践联系牢；
    钻研方针和政策，提高思想有干劲；
    多蒙党校办得好，衷心感谢党领导。
    这首快板，道出了公社办党校的好处，也真实地反映了广大基层干部经过学习获得提高后的激动心情。临川县和各地一样，各项建设事业都在突飞猛进地向前发展。这就要求广大基层干部必须迅速地提高政治理论水平和文化水平，而广大基层干部也都有着强烈的求知欲望。
    “一旗高举万旗飘”，在人民公社化后的第一个春天，社办党校像雨后春笋一般蓬勃发展起来。在去年一年中，全县二十六个公社先后开办了党校一百零八期，培训了农村基层干部和积极分子一万二千多名，取得思想、工作生产齐丰收。如果这些干部都等待县委党校来训练，要五、六年才能训练一次。
    社办党校在创办初期，大部分公社是一无教员和专职干部，二无经费和设备，困难重重。怎么办呢？没有教员，由党委书记兼；没有专职干部，每期从生产大队或机关企业，抽调一部分脱产、半脱产的领导骨干来参加学习，领导学习，既是学员，又是党校的工作人员；没有课堂，就挤，利用空闲房屋和可以腾出来的房屋作课堂；没有经费就找，采取勤工俭学的方法解决；没有经验，就在实践中摸索。
    “理论一经掌握了群众，便立即成为巨大的物质力量”马克思论证的这个真理，在我们社办党校的工作中，得到了最鲜明的印证。干部经过党校学习，大大提高了政治觉悟和理论水平，改进了工作作风。正像学员们说的：
    在校学习十五天，胜过读书一整年。
    公社党校根据各个地区的特点和各个时期的不同情况，从党的各个时期的政治运动和中心工作出发，灵活妥善地安排了学习内容，有力地推动了生产和各项工作。湖南公社学员，通过学习，认识了增产的重要性和不断革命论，回去后，积极投入了积肥造肥运动。太阳公社党校连续在工地上开办了三期训练班，培训了四百七十二名基层干部和积极分子，有力地推动了工具改革和高工效运动，平均工效提高三倍，成为全专区水利建设的一面红旗。
    公社党校是人民公社的产物，到现在只有一年的历史，在这短短一年中已显示它巨大的优越性。它既是学习理论提高思想的课堂，又是交流工作经验的好地方，这新型的红色的学校，是马克思列宁主义和毛泽东著作传播的好地方，在这遍布各个角落的红色学校里，培养了成千上万的社会主义建设人材，为持续跃进输送了坚实的基层领导骨干，为热火朝天的社会主义建设事业输送了新的血液。
