Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 15th: According to the German News Agency, the Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Forces in Germany, Yakubovsky, sent identical letters on May 15th to the commanders of the American, British, and French forces stationed in West Germany, protesting that on May 5th, 1960, an aircraft taking off from West Germany intruded into the airspace of the German Democratic Republic.

The letter stated that the aforementioned aircraft crossed the border of the German Democratic Republic at 17:22 on the 5th, 15 kilometers southwest of Boizenburg, at an altitude of 1,700 meters, and penetrated 90 kilometers into the territory of the German Democratic Republic.

The letter reminded that, according to the Warsaw Treaty, the Soviet troops stationed on the territory of the German Democratic Republic could have taken measures against the intruding aircraft to prevent it from flying with impunity over the territory of the German Democratic Republic. However, the Headquarters of the Soviet Forces in Germany considered it possible not to do so this time.

The letter stated: "I hope that my letter will be understood correctly, and that similar violations will not occur in the future. Furthermore, I should warn that if there are any further incidents of violations of the airspace of the German Democratic Republic from the territory of West Germany, the Soviet military command will have to take the most resolute measures to stop such violations."

In the note, the government of the German Democratic Republic pointed out that the illegal actions of the West Berlin police against railway property have recently increased. There were 47 incidents of this nature in January, while in April alone, there were 306 incidents. Most of these incidents were aimed at disrupting traffic safety and targeting the traffic police of the German Democratic Republic responsible for protecting railway property.

    抗议从西德起飞的飞机侵犯德国领空
    德国政府照会美英法抗议西柏林警察破坏交通安全
    据新华社柏林15日电　据德意志通讯社报道，驻德苏军部队总司令雅库鲍夫斯基于15日给美国、英国和法国驻西德部队司令各发了一封内容相同的信，抗议1960年5月5日一架从西德起飞的飞机侵入德意志民主共和国领空。
    信中说，上述飞机于5日十七时二十二分在波伊森堡西南十五公里的一千七百米的高空中越过德意志民主共和国国境，并深入德意志民主共和国领土九十公里。
    信件提醒说，根据华沙条约驻扎在德意志民主共和国领土上的苏联军队本来可以对入侵飞机采取使它不能在德意志民主共和国领土上空不受惩罚地飞行的措施。但是，驻德苏军部队司令部认为这一次可以不这样做。
    信中说：“我希望我给你的信将得到正确的理解，并希望类似侵犯事件今后不再发生。此外，我应该提出警告，如果今后仍有从西德领土侵犯德意志民主共和国领空的事件发生，那么，苏军司令部将不得不采取最坚决的措施来制止这种侵犯行为。”
    据新华社柏林14日电　德意志民主共和国政府把内容相同的照会送给了美国、英国和法国政府，抗议关于柏林市铁路的事件；同时它通知了苏联政府，并请求苏联政府采取步骤防止西柏林局势恶化。
    德意志民主共和国政府在照会中指出，西柏林警察对铁路财产的非法行动在最近有了增加。在1月份有这种性质的事件四十七起，而在4月一个月，就有三百零六起。其中大部分事件是旨在破坏交通安全，和针对负责保护铁路财产的德意志民主共和国交通警察的。
