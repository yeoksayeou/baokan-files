    Xinhua News Agency, Havana, dispatch: A Cuban government delegation headed by Dorticos departed Havana on the afternoon of the 22nd to visit six Latin American countries at the invitation of their governments.
    The delegation will visit Uruguay, Brazil, Peru, Venezuela, and Mexico after participating in the 150th anniversary celebrations of the May Revolution in Argentina.
    The delegation members include Foreign Minister Roa, Agriculture Minister Miret, and Chief of Staff of the Revolutionary Armed Forces Almeida, among others. "Hoy" (Today) newspaper pointed out in today's editorial that Dorticos's friendly visit is obviously of great significance at a time when imperialists and their lackeys are making every effort to isolate Cuba and win over the governments of South American countries for "collective" intervention in Cuba. Dorticos will bring the fraternal feelings of friendship of the Cuban people to the people of the countries he visits.
    Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, dispatch: The Cuban government delegation headed by Cuban President Dorticos, which is participating in the 150th anniversary celebrations of the May Revolution in Argentina, arrived in Argentina on the afternoon of the 23rd and was warmly welcomed by the Argentine people.
    Approximately two thousand Argentines held signs reading "Long Live the Cuban Revolution" and cheered and applauded the Cuban government delegation. They shouted slogans such as "Cuba, pay attention, the Americas are helping you," "We want Cuba, not the Yankees," "Yankees are the scourge of Latin America," and "Cuba, Cuba." The Argentine President and Foreign Minister, among others, welcomed the Cuban government delegation at the airport.

    应邀访问拉丁美洲六国
    古巴政府代表团到阿根廷
    据新华社哈瓦那电　以多尔蒂科斯为首的古巴政府代表团应拉丁美洲六国政府的邀请，22日下午从哈瓦那启程访问这些国家。
    代表团将在参加阿根廷五月革命一百五十周年纪念活动以后访问乌拉圭、巴西、秘鲁、委内瑞拉和墨西哥。
    代表团成员包括外交部长罗亚，农业部长米雷特和革命武装部队参谋长阿耳梅达等人。“今日报”在今天的社论中指出，在现在帝国主义分子及其走狗正在竭力企图孤立古巴和为对古巴进行“集体”干涉而争取南美各国政府的时候，多尔蒂科斯的友好访问显然具有重要意义。多尔蒂科斯将把古巴人民的兄弟般的友好感情带给他所访问的各国人民。
    新华社布宜诺斯艾利斯电　以古巴总统多尔蒂科斯为首的参加阿根廷五月革命一百五十周年庆祝活动的古巴政府代表团，23日下午到达阿根廷，受到阿根廷人民的热烈欢迎。
    大约有两千阿根廷人举着“古巴革命万岁”的标语牌向古巴政府代表团欢呼和鼓掌。他们高呼“古巴注意，美洲帮助你”、“要古巴，不要美国佬”、“美国佬是拉丁美洲的祸根”、“古巴、古巴”等口号。阿根廷总统和外交部长等人到机场欢迎了古巴政府代表团。
