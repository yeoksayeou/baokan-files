Lanzhou, May 21 (Reported by our newspaper) With the deepening development of the technical revolution movement, Lanzhou Refinery has timely adjusted its labor organization, comprehensively reformed the enterprise's operation and management, production management, and technical management, thereby promoting the further upsurge of production and construction and the deeper development of the technical revolution movement.

In the upsurge of the mass technical revolution movement, many automated pump rooms, automated devices, and automated sections have appeared in Lanzhou Refinery. Therefore, some of the original labor organization and production organization were no longer adapted to the high-speed development of production. Under this new situation, the factory leadership has taken the following measures:

First, mobilizing the masses, relying on the grassroots, and adopting the method of adjusting staffing along with innovation to timely adjust production posts and adopt new staffing, drawing out the surplus labor force to consolidate the achievements of technical innovation. In terms of labor organization, adjustments have also been made to ensure that employees have more time to study culture and technology.

Second, comprehensively reforming office work, carrying out a great revolution in calculation tools and business work. In just a few weeks, departments such as finance, planning, material supply, production management, and design have universally realized charting, manualization, mechanization, and electrification, innovatively creating many rapid calculation tools, and universally improving efficiency by one to forty times. In addition, duplicate calculations were eliminated, report formats were unified, and procedures were simplified, freeing enterprise management personnel from complex calculation work, administrative work, and account books, giving them more time to go deep into the workshops and among the masses.

Third, developing the system of "Two Participations, One Reform, Three Combinations," with workers moving from participating in general enterprise management to participating in scientific research, design, and the revision of process indicators. The factory also adopted a multi-level meeting system to widely absorb workers to participate in production management and technical management, so that enterprise management work can adapt to the needs of production development. With the development of the technical revolution movement and cadres going deep into the production front line to discover and solve problems, some old rules and regulations have been revised in a timely manner. Currently, dozens of process regulations and business management systems have been reformed. At the same time, the "Three Combinations" within the factory has developed into "Three Combinations" inside and outside the enterprise, and has been linked with scientific research institutions and universities to jointly tackle more than 80 major projects.

Fourth, improving leadership methods. First of all, strengthening the Party's leadership on all fronts, strengthening the Party's leadership core, and better implementing centralization on the basis of fully promoting democracy.

    兰州炼油厂适应革新形势改进企业管理
    及时调整劳动组织  系统改革科室工作  发展“两参一改三结合”
    本报兰州21日电　随着技术革命运动的深入发展，兰州炼油厂及时调整了劳动组织，对企业的经营管理、生产管理和技术管理进行了全面的改革，从而促进了生产建设进一步的高涨和技术革命运动更深入的开展。
    在群众性的技术革命运动高潮中，兰州炼油厂出现了许多自动化泵房、自动化装置和自动化工段。因此原来的劳动组织和生产组织有一些就同生产的高速度发展不相适应了。在这种新形势下，厂的领导上采取了以下几项措施：
    第一，发动群众，依靠基层，采取随革新随定员的方法，及时地调整生产岗位，采用新定员，把节余的劳动力抽调出来，以巩固技术革新成果。在劳动组织上，也进行了调整，保证职工有较多的学文化学技术的时间。
    第二，全面改革科室工作，进行计算工具和业务工作的大革命。在短短的几个星期里，财务、计划、材料供应、生产管理、设计等部门普遍实现了图表化、手册化、机械化、电气化，革新创造了许多快速计算工具，普遍提高效率一至四十倍。另外，还取消了重复计算，统一了报表格式，简化了手续，使企业管理人员从繁杂的计算工作、事务工作、账册报表中解放出来，有更多的时间深入车间，深入群众。
    第三，发展了“两参一改三结合”的制度，工人由参加一般的企业管理发展到参加科学研究、设计和工艺指标的修订等工作。这个厂还采用多级会议制度，广泛吸收工人参加生产管理和技术管理，使企业管理工作适应生产发展的需要。随着技术革命运动的发展和干部深入生产前线发现和解决问题，一些旧的规章制度已经及时加以修订。目前已有数十种工艺规程和经营管理制度进行了改革。同时，厂内“三结合”发展为企业内外“三结合”，已经和科学研究机关、大专院校挂了钩，共同猛攻八十多个重大项目。
    第四，改进了领导方法。首先在各个战线上加强了党的领导，增强了党的领导核心，在充分发扬民主的基础上，更好地实行了集中。
