Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan Telegram: The Taiyuan Chemical Plant, aiming for "no wastewater entering the ground, no waste gas rising to the sky, and no waste residue leaving the gate," is vigorously developing comprehensive waste utilization, and has already achieved "one factory equaling one and a half factories." Now, the products operated by this factory have increased from the thirteen listed in the national plan to sixty-nine.

The Taiyuan Chemical Plant is a modern comprehensive chemical factory, requiring many types and large quantities of raw materials for production, but the recovery rate was very low. Since the beginning of this year, in the technical innovation movement, the main workshops have implemented instrumentation, and three sections have achieved full automation. The increase in the degree of automation requires a rapid expansion of comprehensive resource utilization and the opening up of an increase in the quantity and variety of raw materials in order to multiply production. Therefore, the factory's Party committee proposed: "Marching towards waste gas, wastewater, and waste residue," turning harmful into beneficial, and turning useless into useful. Each workshop, with chemical production as the backbone, and with small indigenous groups as the mainstay, combined indigenous and foreign methods to fully utilize waste gas, wastewater, and waste residue for multi-variety production. Since the beginning of this year, twelve workshops have been transformed from single-product to multi-variety production workshops, and two "waste-free workshops" have emerged.

The Taiyuan Chemical Plant has adopted various forms for the comprehensive utilization of waste. For waste that can be recycled and processed locally, they mainly organize the recycling of waste with workshop contracting as the main method and factory-wide cooperation as a supplement. In order to make one thing multi-purpose, they also adopt the method of matching by-products and waste products, turning the "consumption workshops" that used to specialize in treating waste gas, etc., into production workshops. If relying solely on the factory's own waste is not enough to produce finished products or complex processes, they form comprehensive utilization workshops with the waste from brother factories to specialize in production. In addition, the factory also cooperates with street industries and school factories to establish "satellite factories," which process the factory's waste into semi-finished products, which are then processed into new products by the factory.

This newspaper, Nanjing, 11th: The Changzhou Puli Comprehensive Factory in Jiangsu Province, famous for its comprehensive utilization of local resources, is vigorously developing comprehensive utilization and creating new varieties with the spirit of continuous revolution. It not only uses one raw material to produce multiple products, but also uses one product to produce multiple raw materials.

The Puli Comprehensive Factory was originally an oil pressing factory. At the beginning, it could only use rice bran to extract oil. Later, it learned to use the bran cake and rice straw after oil extraction to brew wine, and use rice straw and distiller's grains to make paper, and use soybean skin and soybean cake to make various foods. When the Party branch of this factory saw that due to the great development of the chemical industry, the demand for alcohol was very high, and when there was not a single alcohol factory in Jiangsu Province, it proposed to the factory workers the new task of using white wine to produce alcohol. They sent people to Beijing to learn the experience of refining alcohol, and at the same time, they made a small alcohol distillation tower out of galvanized iron in the factory to conduct experiments using indigenous methods. After more than a month of continuous experimentation, they finally extracted alcohol from the white wine brewed in the factory, and created a kind of ceramic distillation tower with good effect, quickly established an alcohol workshop, and put it into production.

After the successful manufacture of alcohol, they used alcohol to manufacture important raw materials for chemical and pharmaceutical industries—glacial acetic acid. So, they sent people out to study while experimenting with glass flasks on small indigenous stoves, and as a result, they were successful again, and they designed a new set of equipment combining indigenous and foreign methods, which was put into production in just over a month. As soon as glacial acetic acid was "launched," they immediately used glacial acetic acid to produce advanced chemical raw materials such as acetic acid, ethyl acetate (pharmaceutical intermediate), pyrazolone, and naphthoic acid.

Due to the continuous opening up of new avenues for comprehensive utilization, the factory's output value has been growing continuously in the past two years, increasing nearly three times in 1959 compared with 1958, and this year's planned output value will increase six times compared with last year. The number of new products has surged from more than ten to more than thirty, some of which are more advanced pharmaceutical intermediates.

    无用变有用　副产超主产
    太原化工厂大搞综合利用产品增加五十六种
    常州溥利厂不断开辟综合利用门路产值激增
    据新华社太原电　太原化工厂以“废水不入地、废气不上天、废渣不出门”为目标，大搞废物综合利用，已经做到“一厂顶一个半厂”。现在，这个厂经营的产品已经由列入国家计划的十三种增加到六十九种。
    太原化工厂是现代化综合性化学工厂，生产需要的原材料种类多、数量大，但回收率很低。今年以来，这个厂在技术革新运动中，主要车间都实行了仪表化，三个工段实现了全盘自动化。自动化程度的提高，要求迅速扩大资源综合利用，开辟扩大原材料的数量和品种，才能使生产成倍增长。因此工厂党委提出：“向废气、废水、废渣进军”，变有害为有利，变无用为有用。各车间以化工生产为骨干，小土群为主、土洋结合的方针，充分利用废气、废水、废渣进行多品种生产。今年以来有十二个车间由单一产品变成了多品种生产的车间，并出现了两个“无废物车间”。
    太原化工厂对废物的综合利用，采取了多种多样的形式。对能就地回收、加工的废物，他们就以车间包干为主、全厂协作为辅，组织废物的循环使用。为使一物多用，他们还采取了副、废产品配套的办法，把过去专门处理废气等“消费车间”变为生产车间。只靠本厂废物还不能生产成品和工艺复杂的，就与兄弟厂的废物组成综合利用车间专门生产。另外，这个厂还同街道工业、学校工厂协作，成立“卫星厂”，由卫星厂把本厂的废物加工成半成品，然后本厂再加工成新产品。
    本报南京11日电　以综合利用地方资源闻名的江苏省常州市溥利综合工厂，以不断革命的精神，大搞综合利用，大造新品种。不但利用一种原料生产多种产品，而且以一种产品生产多种原料。
    溥利综合工厂原来是个榨油厂，开始时只能利用米糠榨油，此后又学会了利用榨油后的糠饼和稻草酿酒，利用稻草和酒糟造纸，利用大豆皮及豆饼制作各种食用品。当这个厂的党支部看到由于化学工业的大发展，对酒精的需要量很大，当江苏全省还没有一个酒精工厂的时候，就向全厂职工提出了利用白酒造酒精的新任务。他们一面派人到北京学习提炼酒精的经验，一面在厂内用白铁做了一个小型酒精蒸馏塔，先以土办法进行试验。经过一个多月的连续试验，终于从本厂酿造的白酒中炼出了酒精，并创造了一种效果良好的陶瓷蒸馏塔，迅速建立了酒精车间，投入了生产。
    酒精制造成功以后，他们又利用酒精制造化工和医药的重要原料——冰醋酸。于是又一面派人出外学习，一面用玻璃烧瓶在小土炉上进行试验，结果又获得了成功，并且自己设计了一套土洋结合的新设备，只用了一个多月就投入了生产。冰醋酸一“上马”，他们又马不停蹄利用冰醋酸生产了乙酸、乙酯（医药中间体）吡唑酮、荼工酸等高级化工原料。
    这个厂由于不断地开辟新的综合利用的门路，两年来产值不断增长，1959年比1958年增长将近三倍，今年的计划产值又将比去年增加六倍。新产品已由十多种激增到三十多种，其中有几种原料是较高级的医药中间体。
