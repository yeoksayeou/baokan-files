Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 16th. The industrial conference convened by the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party victoriously concluded on the 6th. Comrade Ke Qingshi, First Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, issued a battle call to all Shanghai workers and the people of the city at the closing of the conference, demanding further efforts to grasp consolidation, promotion, and improvement work, so that all technical innovation and technical revolution projects would universally blossom and bear fruit, and continue to create more, better, and more effective innovation projects, so that the technical revolution would continue to blossom, continue to bear fruit, and strive to achieve one person doing the work of several, one material being used for several, one factory doing the work of several, and one product doing the work of several, to struggle for the realization of a better and more comprehensive Great Leap Forward this year.

Ke Qingshi succinctly pointed out the new developments in the current technical innovation and technical revolution movement in Shanghai. He said: In the first four months of this year, the achievements in technical innovation and technical revolution have been enormous, and great progress has been made in mechanization and semi-mechanization, automation and semi-automation, as well as the adoption of new technologies, new techniques, and the creation of new products and new raw materials. What is particularly important is that we have found a broad and rapid road to carry out the technical revolution. He said: Although the achievements we have made are great, we must regard them as a good start, and we must never be complacent. Whoever is complacent will make mistakes. He said that the technical revolution is endless, and the road to further develop the technical revolution is exceptionally broad; at the same time, the new situation also requires us to achieve greater results in the technical revolution. With the continuous leap forward in socialist construction, Shanghai's task of supporting national construction is becoming increasingly heavy, and it is the glorious duty of the people of Shanghai to support national construction and people's lives with more and better machinery and equipment and various products. Therefore, we must carry forward the spirit of continuous revolution and achieve greater, more, and better results in the coming months, so that the development of the technical revolution movement exceeds spring in summer and the second half of the year exceeds the first half.

Regarding the current movement, Ke Qingshi emphasized: We must focus on consolidation, promotion, and improvement work, so that all effective innovation projects will universally blossom and bear great and substantial fruits; the phenomenon of only blossoming and not bearing fruit, or blossoming more and bearing less, must be improved in the short term. Some innovation projects should be universally promoted within the entire industry, and those innovation projects with universal significance should be universally promoted throughout the city. In this way, pushing the movement forward wave upon wave, each wave higher than the last, we can strive to achieve one person doing the work of several, one material being used for several, one factory doing the work of several, and one product doing the work of several.

In order to achieve greater achievements in the technical revolution movement in the future, Ke Qingshi pointed out that it is necessary to further mobilize the masses. In the previous period, although the development of the movement was very extensive, it was still uneven. It is necessary to fully mobilize more people to consciously engage in the technical revolution movement. At the same time, it is necessary to further improve the skills of the masses. The previous stage of the technical revolution movement should be well summarized, not only to summarize the laws of the mass movement, but also to summarize the laws of science and technology, in order to improve the Mao Zedong Thought level and the scientific and technological level of the vast number of cadres and the masses, and to further arm the masses. In this way, we can fully utilize the wisdom of the masses and create greater achievements. Comrade Ke Qingshi asked the leading cadres of enterprises to be more comprehensively concerned about the masses, maintain closer ties with the masses, and work with the masses to vigorously grasp consolidation, promotion, and improvement work, and make greater, more, and better achievements in the coming months.

Finally, Ke Qingshi asked leading cadres at all levels to organize production more systematically and more planned, strengthen the comprehensive transformation of enterprises, and make Shanghai's industrial layout more reasonable and more perfect.

The Shanghai Industrial Conference was convened on March 26. A total of 12,000 cadres from the city to the grassroots workshop branches on the city's industrial, capital construction, transportation, and science and technology fronts attended. The cadres attending the meeting, in accordance with the spirit of opposing right-leaning and encouraging hard work, conducted in-depth discussions; at the same time, they adopted a method combining internal and external meetings to vigorously carry out comparisons and experience exchanges, and formulate plans. The cadres attending the meeting enhanced their understanding, clarified the direction, and immediately implemented the spirit of the meeting in their respective units, mobilizing the masses to launch a new high tide of the movement. Therefore, during the meeting, a very good situation appeared in the city's industry and other fronts.

The mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution has been further developed on the basis of consolidation, promotion, and improvement. The content of innovation is becoming more and more abundant, and many new technologies, new techniques, new products, and new materials have been created. The idea of ​​starting with indigenous methods, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and giving priority to indigenous methods has become more deeply rooted in people's hearts, and the scope of application of indigenous methods is also becoming wider and wider. Many industries have undergone profound revolutions in technology due to the adoption and promotion of new technologies and new techniques, which has greatly changed the face of production. The degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization in the city has reached a considerable level, and new developments have been made in automation and semi-automation. The proportion of manual operation has decreased. In the industrial system alone, more than 200,000 people have been freed from manual operation, saving more than 100,000 labor forces.

The scope of comprehensive utilization of resources and the conservation and substitution of raw materials in the city is becoming wider and wider, not only including coal, wood and metal materials, but also widely utilizing waste water, waste gas, sewage, sludge, slag, agricultural and sideline products and wild plants, etc.

At the closing of the meeting on the 6th, Comrade Cao Diqiu, Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, made a report on further consolidating, promoting, and improving the achievements of technical innovation and technical revolution, and realizing a comprehensive leap forward in industrial production this year. He summarized and analyzed the excellent situation of the current technical innovation and technical revolution movement, and pointed out that the current central task is to closely combine technical revolution with production, and realize the double harvest of technical revolution and production.

Cao Diqiu said that vigorously grasping consolidation, promotion, and improvement does not mean stopping the movement, but to promote the technical innovation and technical revolution movement to a higher stage in a more prepared, more planned, and more purposeful manner. He pointed out that it is necessary to oppose being satisfied with the existing innovation achievements, interrupting the innovation movement, or being satisfied only with the bustling and rapidly changing atmosphere, and not doing solid consolidation and promotion work. Both of these ideas do not conform to Chairman Mao's ideas on continuous revolution and the stages of revolutionary development.

Cao Diqiu said that in the process of consolidation, promotion, and improvement, another ideological problem must be solved, that is, to correct the view of indigenous methods. Indigenous methods, as some people understand them, are not low-level and backward methods, but a method temporarily adopted before there are foreign equipment and foreign methods. The so-called indigenous method comes from the masses with rich production experience, and is an original method that meets the actual production situation and actual needs, so it is often advanced, scientific, and has strong vitality. Some even far exceed foreign methods and produce unexpected and huge economic effects. Combining indigenous and foreign methods, giving priority to indigenous methods, and constantly developing and improving indigenous methods, we can explore the laws of technological development and production development, find a faster, better, and more economical road for technological revolution, and find a road to rapidly develop science and technology that suits China's characteristics.

He pointed out that all effective innovation projects must be promoted quickly without omission. The promotion of technical innovation projects must vigorously carry out mass movements, and at the same time, there must be special personnel in charge, grasp tightly, grasp hard, and strengthen specific leadership. On the basis of consolidation and promotion, it is also necessary to adopt a method combining mass and professional institutions to mobilize scientific research institutions, universities, colleges, and technical personnel of factories to theoretically summarize and improve the new technologies, new techniques, new equipment, and new products that have emerged in the movement.

Cao Diqiu also talked about the need to actively develop high-end, sophisticated, and cutting-edge products, continuously improve product quality, strive for products to reach first-class levels, and comprehensively complete national plans. He said that this year, when we are grasping production, in addition to grasping output value, grasping high-end, sophisticated, and cutting-edge products, and grasping quality, we must also grasp output, product variety, labor productivity, raw material consumption quotas, and costs, in order to better and more comprehensively complete the national plan.

In order to achieve a double harvest of innovation and production, Cao Diqiu pointed out in the report that the following links related to industrial production should be quickly grasped: (1) Vigorously increase production, save and comprehensively utilize raw materials, and develop diversified operations. (2) Vigorously strengthen transportation work. (3) Improve enterprise management in a timely manner, and adjust labor organization and production organization. (4) Strengthen scientific research, vigorously engage in cultural revolution, and rapidly strengthen the technical team of the working class. (5) Actively support the development of rural and urban people's commune industry.

Finally, Cao Diqiu called on party organizations at all levels to strengthen the party's leadership and further carry out the movement to study Comrade Mao Zedong's works.

    让所有革新项目普遍开花结果  继续创造更大更多更好的革新成就
    技术革命运动定要夏季超春季
    柯庆施同志号召上海职工进一步大搞巩固、推广、提高的工作
    据新华社上海电　中共上海市委召开的工业会议，已于6日胜利结束。中共上海市委第一书记柯庆施同志在会议闭幕时，向上海全体职工和全市人民发出战斗号召，要求进一步大抓巩固、推广、提高工作，使所有的技术革新和技术革命项目普遍开花结果，并继续创造数量更多、效果更大的革新项目，使技术革命不断开花，不断结果，极力争取做到一个人顶几个人用，一份材料顶几份材料用，一个厂顶几个厂用，一件产品顶几件产品用，为实现今年更好更全面的大跃进而奋斗。
    柯庆施扼要地指出了当前上海技术革新和技术革命运动的新发展。他说：今年前四个月，技术革新和技术革命的成就是巨大的，在机械化半机械化、自动化半自动化，以及采用新工艺、新技术，创制新产品、新原材料等方面，都取得了很大的成绩。其中特别重要的，是我们找到了广泛迅速开展技术革命的大道。他说：我们取得的成绩虽然很大，但必须把它看做是一个良好的开始，我们决不应自满，谁自满谁就要犯错误。他说，技术革命是永无止境的，进一步开展技术革命的道路是异常宽广的；同时，新的形势也要求我们在技术革命上取得更大的成果，随着社会主义建设的持续跃进，上海工业支援国家建设的任务日益加重，以更多更好的机器设备和各种产品支援国家建设和人民生活的需要，是上海人民的光荣的职责。所以，必须发扬不断革命的精神，在今后几个月内，取得更大更多更好的成绩，务使技术革命运动的发展，夏季超过春季，下半年超过上半年。
    对当前运动，柯庆施强调指出：必须大抓巩固、推广、提高工作，使一切行之有效的革新项目普遍开花结果，结大果，结硕果；只开花不结果，或开花多结果少的现象，务必在短期内加以改进。有些革新项目应在全行业范围内普遍推广，那些有普遍意义的革新项目，更应在全市范围内普遍推广。这样，推动运动一浪推一浪、一浪高一浪地向前发展，就可以争取做到一个人顶几个人用，一份材料顶几份材料用，一个厂顶几个厂用，一件产品顶几件产品用。
    为了使技术革命运动在今后取得更大的成绩，柯庆施指出，必须进一步发动群众。在前一个时期，运动的发展虽然很广泛，但还是不平衡的，必须把更多的人充分动员起来，自觉地投入技术革命运动。同时，要进一步提高群众的本领，对前一段的技术革命运动，应很好地进行总结，不仅总结出群众运动的规律，而且总结出科学技术的规律，以提高广大干部和群众的毛泽东思想水平和科学技术的水平，把群众进一步武装起来。这样就可以充分发挥群众的智慧，创造更大的成绩。柯庆施同志要求企业的领导干部更加全面地关心群众，更密切地联系群众，和群众一起，大抓巩固、推广、提高工作，在今后几个月内做出更大更多更好的成绩。
    最后，柯庆施要求各级领导干部更有系统、更有计划地组织生产，加强对企业的全面改造，使上海的工业布局更加合理，更加完善。
    上海市工业会议是3月26日召开的，出席的有全市工业、基本建设、交通运输、科学技术等战线上从市到基层车间支部五级干部，共一万二千人。到会干部根据反右倾、鼓干劲的精神，进行了深入的讨论；同时采取了会内会外相结合的办法，大搞评比和经验交流，制订规划。出席会议的干部提高了认识，明确了方向，就立即在本单位贯彻会议精神，发动群众掀起新的运动高潮。因此，在会议期间，全市工业和其他各条战线都出现了一派大好形势。
    技术革新和技术革命的群众运动在巩固、推广、提高的基础上，有了进一步的发展，革新的内容愈来愈丰富，创造了许多新工艺、新技术、新产品、新材料。土法上马、土洋结合，以土为主的思想更加深入人心，土办法应用的范围也愈来愈广泛。许多行业由于采用、推广了新工艺、新技术，在工艺技术上引起了深刻的革命，使生产面貌发生了极大的变化，全市机械化、半机械化程度已达到相当高的程度，自动化半自动化有了新的发展，手工操作的比重下降了，仅工业系统就有二十多万人摆脱了手工操作，节约了十万多个劳动力。
    全市资源的综合利用和原材料的节约代用的范围愈来愈广，不仅包括煤炭、木材和金属材料，而且广泛利用废水、废气、污水、污泥、矿渣、农副产品和野生植物等等。
    在6日会议闭幕时，中共上海市委书记处书记曹荻秋同志就进一步巩固、推广、提高技术革新和技术革命成就，实现今年工业生产全面大跃进的问题作了报告。他总结分析了当前技术革新和技术革命运动的大好形势，指出当前的中心任务是必须把技术革命和生产紧密结合起来，实现技术革命和生产的双丰收。
    曹荻秋说，大抓巩固、推广、提高，绝不意味着把运动停下来，而是为了更有准备、更有计划、更有目的地把技术革新和技术革命运动推向一个更高的阶段。他指出，必须反对满足于现有的革新成果，把革新运动中断下来，或者是只满足于轰轰烈烈日新夜异的气氛，不作踏实的巩固推广工作。这两种思想都不符合毛主席关于不断革命论和革命发展的阶段论的思想。
    曹荻秋说，在巩固、推广、提高的过程中，还必须解决另一个思想问题，就是端正对土法的看法。土办法并不像某些人所理解的那样，是低级的、落后的办法，是一种在没有洋设备、洋办法之前而暂时采用的办法。所谓土法，是从有丰富的生产经验的群众中来的，是切合生产实际情况和实际需要的独创的办法，因而往往是先进的、科学的、有强大生命力的。有些甚至远远超过洋办法，产生意想不到的巨大经济效果。土洋结合，以土为主，并且不断发展、提高土办法，就可以从中摸索到技术发展和生产发展的规律，找到一条技术革命的多快好省的道路，找到一条适合我国特点的迅速发展科学技术的道路。
    他指出，凡是行之有效的革新项目，都必须一条不漏，迅速推广。技术革新项目的推广工作必须大搞群众运动，同时还必须有专人负责，抓紧、抓狠，加强具体领导。在巩固、推广的基础上，还要采取群众性与专业机关相结合的办法，动员科学研究机关、大专学校、工厂的技术人员，把运动中涌现出来的新工艺、新技术、新设备、新产品，分门别类地从理论上加以总结和提高。
    曹荻秋在报告中还谈到必须积极发展高、精、尖产品，不断提高产品质量，力争产品达到第一流水平，全面完成国家计划等问题。他说，今年我们在抓生产的时候，除了抓产值、抓高精尖产品、抓质量以外，还必须抓产量、产品品种、劳动生产率、原材料消耗定额和成本，以便更好更全面地完成国家计划。
    为了实现革新和生产双丰收，曹荻秋在报告中指出，当前应该迅速抓好有关工业生产的几个环节：（一）大力进行原材料的增产节约和综合利用，发展多种经营。（二）大力加强交通运输工作。（三）及时改进企业管理，调整劳动组织和生产组织。（四）加强科学研究，大闹文化革命，迅速壮大工人阶级的技术队伍。（五）积极支援城乡人民公社工业的发展。
    最后，曹荻秋号召各级党组织必须加强党的领导，进一步开展学习毛泽东同志著作的运动。
