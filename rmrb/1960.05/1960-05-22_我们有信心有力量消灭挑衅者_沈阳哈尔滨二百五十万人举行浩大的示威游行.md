    Xinhua News Agency, May 21st: Over 3.57 million people from all walks of life in Shenyang, Harbin, Anshan, and Andong held unprecedented rallies and demonstrations to support the Soviet Union's just stance against U.S. imperialism's aggression and to oppose U.S. imperialism's sabotage of the Four-Power Summit.

    In Shenyang today, over 1.5 million people gathered and marched. The vast expanse of the People's Stadium and surrounding streets were filled with an endless stream of people, including workers, farmers, members of urban people's communes, students, officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, and fully armed militia. They carried placards and various caricatures satirizing American warmongers, participating in the rally in neat rows. Thirty-odd venues in various districts of the city simultaneously held rallies today alongside the central venue, the People's Stadium.

    Leading figures from the Liaoning Province and Shenyang City Party and government, responsible persons from various democratic parties and people's organizations, and commanders of the PLA units stationed in Shenyang participated in the rally.

    Soviet experts working in Shenyang also attended the rally. Foreign friends visiting Shenyang and students and interns from the Soviet Union, North Korea, and Vietnam also participated in the rally.

    Amidst rousing slogans from the entire venue, Huang Huoqing, First Secretary of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, spoke first. He vehemently condemned the U.S. imperialist crime of sending spy planes to intrude into Soviet airspace on the eve of the Four-Power Summit. He pointed out that this incident was not accidental but a despicable act by U.S. imperialism to deliberately sabotage the Four-Power Summit, a war provocation against the Soviet Union, the socialist camp, and the peace-loving people of the world. He expressed warm support for the Soviet government's solemn stance against U.S. imperialist aggression. Huang Huoqing said: The era of imperialism running amok and acting arbitrarily is gone forever. The people of the world will never forgive the crimes of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. Imperialism is bound to perish, and the people are bound to win. Huang Huoqing's speech was repeatedly interrupted by slogans and applause from the masses.

    Finally, the masses at the city-wide demonstration rally shouted in unison: "U.S. imperialism get out of our Taiwan! Get out of Japan! Get out of South Korea! Get back to your old home from Asia, Africa, and Latin America!" African friends visiting here also led everyone in shouting "Down with U.S. imperialism!" from the rostrum.

    Zhang Jihui, the former volunteer air force hero who shot down four American saber jets and eliminated the American "ace" pilot Davis during the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, also participated in the demonstration march after passing through Shenyang today.

    One million people from all walks of life in Harbin held an unprecedented grand rally and demonstration today to support the just stance of the Soviet government and resolutely condemn U.S. imperialism's sabotage of the Four-Power Summit.

    This morning, large banners were hung high on the main buildings of Harbin's streets. Towards noon, the city's streets and alleys were crowded with workers, farmers, students, government cadres, officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, and fully armed militia. Holding up placards, they formed a mighty torrent, raising their arms and shouting: "Oppose U.S. imperialism's sabotage of the Four-Power Summit!" "Oppose U.S. imperialism's aggression and provocation against the Soviet Union!" "Long live the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!" "People of the world unite, down with U.S. imperialism!" and other slogans, surging towards the rally venue.

    Ouyang Qin, First Secretary of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Li Fanwu, Secretary of the Provincial Committee and Governor, and responsible persons from the provincial and municipal democratic parties and people's organizations, participated in today's rally.

    Soviet Consul General in Harbin, Kulikov, Vice-Consuls Osachi and Kubasov, and Soviet experts assisting in construction in Harbin also participated in the rally. Also participating in the rally were Schmidt, President of the German Democratic Republic's Issuing Bank, and the Swedish workers' delegation led by Stan Schoeber, Chairman of the Swedish Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Union, who were visiting Harbin.

    Overseas Chinese who returned from Cambodia, Indonesia, Peru, and Japan, as well as compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao, also participated in today's rally.

    Ouyang Qin, First Secretary of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, spoke at the rally. He represented the people of the entire province in resolutely supporting the just stance of the Soviet government and sternly condemned U.S. imperialism's sabotage of the Four-Power Summit. Ouyang Qin concluded by saying that the people of Heilongjiang Province, like the rest of the country, must further accelerate the pace of socialist construction, strengthen the power of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and wage a resolute struggle against imperialism and in defense of world peace.

    Also speaking at the rally were Li Yanlu, Chairman of the Heilongjiang Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, Huang Fanggang, representative of local organizations of various democratic parties, Chang Yibin, representative of various people's organizations, Su Guangming, industrial labor model, Hu Lianhai, agricultural labor model, and Kulikov, Soviet Consul General in Harbin.

    At 4 p.m. on the 21st, the people of Anshan poured out from blast furnaces, open-hearth furnaces, rolling mills, government offices, schools, troops, and shops, converging from all directions to the central venue – Victory Square. 150,000 people participated in the central venue, waving various flags, carrying huge banners and cartoons, constantly raising their arms and roaring: "Oppose U.S. imperialism's sabotage of the Four-Power Summit!" "Support the Soviet government's solemn stance against U.S. imperialism's crimes of aggression!" "People of the world unite, down with U.S. imperialism!" The angry slogans at the venue merged into a raging sea, wave after wave.

    At the same time, 650,000 people in Anshan held rallies and demonstrations in more than a dozen areas.

    At the beginning of the rally, Yang Shijie, First Secretary of the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Kabantchev, representative of Soviet experts working in Anshan, spoke at the meeting. Yang Shijie and Kabantchev's speeches aroused bursts of slogans and thunderous applause from the people in the square. In his speech, Yang Shijie first expressed the firm support of the 2.5 million people of Anshan for the just position of the Soviet Union and strongly condemned the United States for sabotaging the Four-Power Summit.

    Representatives of steelworkers said in their speeches that the employees of Angang fully support the Soviet Union's just stance against U.S. sabotage of the Four-Power Summit. Meng Tai, a national model worker and deputy director of Angang's ironmaking plant, said: "If U.S. imperialism insists on aggressive war, it is like hitting a stone with an egg. It is asking for death. Our steelworkers are determined to produce more high-quality steel to strengthen the power of the socialist camp. If U.S. imperialism dares to launch a war, we will smash their heads!"

    At the rally of 270,000 people in Andong City, Liaoning Province, Song Kenan, First Secretary of the Andong Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, firmly stated: The two million people of Andong City, who once stood at the forefront of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, fully support the solemn stance taken by the Soviet Union on the Four-Power Government Summit and resolutely support the Soviet Union's just struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression and provocation. They personally witnessed U.S. imperialism igniting the flames of aggression in our neighbor, Korea, and personally suffered the bombing of American planes. The people of Andong City, together with the people of the whole country and the people of Korea, waged a resolute struggle against U.S. imperialism, defeated U.S. imperialism, and defended world peace. The people of Andong City, who had suffered from the bombing of U.S. imperialist planes and had a bloody feud with U.S. imperialism, were aroused to strong anger by the U.S. imperialist crime of aggression against the Soviet Union. Youth Square became an ocean of anger.

    After the mass rallies were held in various places, large-scale demonstrations were held.
