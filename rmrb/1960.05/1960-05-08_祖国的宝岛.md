　　The Motherland's Treasure Island
　　Bai Miao
　　Hainan Island is the treasure island of the motherland. It not only has beautiful mountains and rivers, fertile fields, and abundant mineral resources, but also glorious revolutionary historical sites. Its area is more than 33,500 square kilometers, and its coastline is as long as 1,400 kilometers. Su Shi of the Song Dynasty, when he was exiled to Hainan Island, wrote the poem "All four seasons are summer, and a rain turns into autumn," which describes the characteristics of Hainan Island's climate.
　　Now, the total population of Hainan Island is more than 3.1 million, with industrious and brave ethnic groups such as Han, Li, Miao, Hui, and Dan people. They have a glorious revolutionary tradition. As early as the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, the story of Lin Tuyuan organizing militias to resist the Qing army and the story of Chen Jiyu, a peasant leader, leading a peasant uprising in 1915, are still widely circulated among the people, demonstrating the revolutionary spirit of the Hainan people. In 1925, the Communist Party of China established organizations on Hainan Island, led the people's revolutionary struggle, and established revolutionary base areas on the island. The revolutionary struggle persisted for twenty-three years, until it cooperated with the army to cross the sea and achieve a comprehensive victory.
　　After liberation, Hainan Island embarked on a new stage, and the cause of socialist construction flourished, rapidly changing the old face and becoming the treasure island of the motherland, radiating beautiful brilliance. Hainan Island is rich in mineral resources and is also a tropical resource area. Now iron, coal, copper, lead, phosphorus, graphite, pyrite and other minerals have been mined, with brilliant results; the development of tropical crops is also being carried out in an all-round way. This year is the first year of basically completing the development of Hainan's tropical resources in three years, and large-scale development using machinery is underway. In addition to state-owned farms, people's communes have also established specialized teams for development, and the development work is advancing by leaps and bounds. Under the correct leadership of the Party and with the strong support of the people of the whole country, and with the efforts of the people of the whole island, Hainan Island will soon become the most beautiful and rich treasure island of the motherland.

    祖国的宝岛
    白苗
    海南岛是祖国的宝岛。它不但有美丽的山川，肥沃的原野，丰富的矿藏，更有光辉的革命史迹。它的面积有三万三千五百多方公里，海岸线长达一千四百多公里。宋朝苏轼谪居海南岛时，曾有“四时皆是夏，一雨便成秋”的诗句，写出海南岛气候的特点。
    现在，海南岛的总人口达三百一十多万，有汉族、黎族、苗族、回族和蛋民等勤劳、勇敢的民族。他们有革命的光荣传统，早在明末清初，林土元组织民兵抵御清军的故事和1915年农民领袖陈继虞领导农民暴动的故事，至今还在民间广为流传，表现出海南人民的革命精神。1925年，中国共产党在海南岛建立组织，领导人民革命斗争，并在岛上建立革命根据地。革命斗争坚持二十三年，直至配合大军渡海，取得全面胜利。
    解放后，海南岛又跨上了崭新的阶段，社会主义建设事业蓬勃发展，迅速地改变了旧的面貌，成为祖国的宝岛，焕发着美丽的光彩。海南岛矿藏丰富，又是热带资源地区，现在铁、煤、铜、铅、磷、石墨、黄铁矿等矿，业已开采，成绩辉煌；热带作物的开发工作，也正全面开展。今年是三年基本完成开发海南热带资源的第一年，使用机械大规模开发正在进行，除了国营农场，人民公社也设立了开发的专业队伍，开发工作正在飞跃前进。在党的正确领导和在全国人民大力支持下，在全岛人民的努力下，不久海南岛就将成为祖国最美丽和富饶的宝岛。
