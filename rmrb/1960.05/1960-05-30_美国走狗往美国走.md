    American Running Dogs Go Back to America
    Poem by Chi Bei'ou, Cartoon by Fang Cheng
The South Korean "founding father" in the mouth of the American president, the American lackey in the eyes of the South Korean people. The "founding father's" homeland is on the other side of the Pacific, and the lackey naturally seeks refuge in the master's embrace. From where they came, roll back to where they came from, along with those American-style "freedom" and "democracy." Fearing the punishment and pursuit of the people, American running dogs are all going back to America. Syngman Rhee is not the first, Jiménez and others are already waiting there; Syngman Rhee is definitely not the last, to be followed by the likes of Ngo Dinh Diem and Nobusuke Kishi.

    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 29th: Seoul report: Recently, Syngman Rhee, the American imperialist running dog who was ousted by the South Korean people, secretly fled to the United States by plane this morning, fearing punishment by the people.

    According to reports, Syngman Rhee's escape was agreed upon during a secret meeting two days ago between the American ambassador to South Korea, McConaughy, and the new American puppet "Acting President" Heo Jeong. Heo Jeong went to the airport this morning to see Syngman Rhee off.

    The reason that prompted Syngman Rhee to leave by plane was obviously the increasingly strong demands of the South Korean people to completely abolish the fascist reign of terror and punish the Syngman Rhee group.

    美国走狗往美国走
    池北偶诗　方成画美国总统嘴里的南朝鲜“国父”，南朝鲜人民眼里的美国奴仆，“国父”的祖国本在太平洋彼岸，奴仆自然向主子怀里寻找归宿。从那儿来的滚回那儿去，连同那些美式“自由”和“民主”。害怕人民的惩罚和追究，美国走狗都往美国走。李承晚并不是头一名，希门尼斯等人已在那里恭候；李承晚也绝不是最后一个，跟着就到的将有吴庭艳、岸信介之流。
    据新华社平壤29日电　汉城消息：最近被南朝鲜人民赶下台的美帝国主义走狗李承晚，由于害怕人民的惩罚，今天上午秘密地乘飞机逃到美国去。
    据报道，李承晚的逃亡是由美国驻南朝鲜大使麦克瑙吉和美国新傀儡“代理总统”许政两天前举行秘密会议时协议的。许政今天上午到机场给李承晚送行。
    促使李承晚乘飞机出走的原因显然是南朝鲜人民愈来愈强烈地要求彻底废除法西斯恐怖统治和惩办李承晚集团。
