Who Exactly is Preparing a Surprise Attack?
Yiershan

The Washington authorities, in order to justify American aggression, insist that aerial espionage activities against the Soviet Union are for the purpose of preventing a “surprise attack” by the Soviet Union. Eisenhower claimed that because he "didn't want another Pearl Harbor," "we must know the military forces and preparations around the world, especially those countries capable of launching large-scale surprise attacks."

This statement is clearly a slander against the Soviet Union. As everyone knows, the Soviet Union is a socialist country, a peace-loving country, and will never launch a war. Therefore, in fact, there is no threat of a "surprise attack" on the United States at all. This is so clear that even US Vice President Nixon admitted in a speech on April 23 that the Soviet Union did not want war. A recent US official publication, "Army Information Digest," also stated that the Soviet Union "has not attempted to build an army sufficient to carry out a nuclear knockout surprise attack on the United States." The so-called threat of a "surprise attack" from the Soviet Union is purely a fabrication.

The opposite is true. The Soviet Union and other socialist countries, as well as some nationalist countries, are constantly under the threat of "surprise attacks," and this threat comes precisely from the United States.

Since the end of World War II, the United States has launched "surprise attacks" on other countries more than once to realize its aggressive plans. On June 25, 1950, the United States instigated its South Korean puppets to suddenly launch a "northward advance," attempting to annex the Democratic People's Republic of Korea at once and further invade China. This was a "surprise attack." In 1958, after the Iraqi people overthrew the Faisal dynasty, the United States suddenly marched into Lebanon on July 15, attempting to suppress the Lebanese national liberation movement and strangle the newborn Iraqi Republic. This was also a "surprise attack." Currently, the United States is actively planning to launch another "surprise attack" to subvert the Republic of Cuba. The notice recently exposed by Cuba from the US embassy regarding preparations for a war of aggression is solid proof. Due to the increasing awakening of people of all countries, American aggression everywhere will inevitably encounter stubborn resistance. American aggressors will inevitably have to rely more on "surprise attack" actions that catch the people of all countries off guard in order to achieve their aggressive goals.

As for the powerful socialist camp, the United States has always planned to launch a so-called "preemptive" war. The US efforts to organize military blocs and establish a network of military bases surrounding the Soviet Union and other socialist countries are all preparations for launching such a war. Since the United States lost its atomic monopoly, more people in the US military have advocated a nuclear blitzkrieg against the Soviet Union, destroying the Soviet military forces at once to avoid a devastating counterattack. Dulles' so-called "massive retaliation" policy is merely to cover up the aggressive nature of the "preemptive" nuclear blitzkrieg that the United States is preparing to launch. Former US Secretary of Defense McElroy publicly stated in April 1958 that he believed that a war against the Soviet Union would be a nuclear blitzkrieg. He said: "The attack may not exceed two or three times.... And all this happens in a fairly short period of time.... I think it happens within a few days." In recent years, although the United States has lost its military advantage, US military leaders have advocated even more the so-called "offense instead of defense" and have sought grounds for launching such a war of aggression. American famous military commentator Baldwin revealed last July when talking about the Pentagon's revised so-called "defense plan" that the US military authorities emphasized that "today's best defense is only one - offense." American Strategic Air Command Commander Power openly advocated launching a "preemptive war" against the Soviet Union in a book he wrote last year. He said, "Although our preemptive action may cause open war, this is still not a strategy of aggression, because the purpose of taking this action is for self-defense." The United States is currently stepping up the expansion of its military strength, especially frantically developing missile weapons, precisely to establish what they believe to be a force capable of destroying the Soviet Union's combat capabilities. Since the beginning of this year, the United States' strategic deployments have been adjusted particularly significantly for the purpose of attack. The United States has canceled the development of the "Bomarc B" long-range defensive missile program and reduced funding for the "Nike-Hercules" air defense missile, while concentrating its efforts on developing offensive strategic weapons such as the "Atlas" missile.

The repeated violations of Soviet and other socialist countries' airspace by US aircraft to collect military intelligence are precisely preparations for a "surprise attack" by the United States against the socialist camp. The aforementioned US Strategic Air Command Commander Power openly stated that the United States must obtain certain "information necessary for attack" in order to launch a war. After the failure of the recent US aircraft provocation against the Soviet Union, US military and political officials actually made such a remark, saying that the fact that US aircraft that intruded into Soviet airspace were not shot down at the border shows that the United States has the ability to carry out air strikes against the Soviet Union. Although this statement is unfounded, it exposes that these provocative activities by US aircraft, in addition to collecting intelligence, also have the purpose of testing the Soviet Union's defense against "surprise attacks."

However, US officials, including Eisenhower, are using the prevention of "surprise attacks" as an excuse for US espionage activities against the Soviet Union, and even based on this untenable excuse, announced that they will continue to carry out such aggressive activities. The American aggressive bloc is not only a thief crying "stop thief", but also openly declares that it will continue to be a thief after being caught, supposedly for the purpose of catching thieves. It is truly shameless and unreasonable to the extreme. The activities of US spy planes completely expose the US secret and active planning of surprise attacks against the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, educating the people of all countries and prompting them to be a hundred times more vigilant against US aggressive conspiracies. And the downing of US spy aircraft also fully proves that if the United States dares to launch a "surprise attack" against socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, it will inevitably suffer a devastating blow.

    究竟谁在准备突然袭击？
    伊尔山
    华盛顿当局为了要为美国的侵略行为辩解，硬说对苏联的空中间谍活动是为了防止遭受苏联的“突然袭击”。艾森豪威尔声称，因为“不希望再来一次珍珠港事件”所以“我们必须知道全世界的、特别是那些有能力发动大规模突袭的国家的军事部队和准备情况。”
    这种说法显然是对苏联的一种诬蔑。人所共知，苏联是社会主义国家，是爱好和平的国家，绝不会发动战争，所以事实上根本不存在什么对美国的“突然袭击”的威胁。这一点是如此明白，连美国的副总统尼克松在4月23日的演说中也承认苏联不要战争。最近一本美国官方刊物“陆军情报文摘”也说，苏联“并未试图建立足以对美国进行核子击倒性突袭的军队”。所谓来自苏联的“突然袭击”的威胁，完全是一种无中生有的捏造罢了。
    事实正好相反，倒是苏联和其他社会主义国家和一些民族主义国家时刻遭受着“突然袭击”的威胁，这种威胁正是来自美国。
    第二次世界大战结束以来，美国曾经不止一次的对别的国家发动“突然袭击”来实现它的侵略计划。1950年6月25日美国唆使它的南朝鲜走狗猝然发动“北进”，企图一下并吞朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，并进一步向中国进行侵略，就是一次“突然袭击”。1958年在伊拉克人民推翻了费萨尔王朝后，美国在7月15日突然进军黎巴嫩，企图镇压黎巴嫩的民族解放运动，并且扼死新生的伊拉克共和国，也是一次“突然袭击”。目前美国又正在积极策划发动一次“突然袭击”来颠复古巴共和国，古巴最近揭发的美国大使馆为侵略战争准备的告示就是铁证。由于各国人民的日益觉醒，美国在各处的侵略都不可避免地要遭到顽强的抵抗，美国侵略者就必然更加要依靠使各国人民措手不及的“突然袭击”的行动来达到它的侵略目的。
    至于对强大的社会主义阵营，美国从来就是计划要发动所谓“先发制人”的战争的。美国努力组织军事集团，建立包围苏联和其他社会主义国家的军事基地网，都是为了发动这种战争作准备。自从美国丧失了它的原子垄断以后，美国军方就有更多人主张对苏联进行原子闪电战，一下子摧毁苏联的军事力量，以避免遭到毁灭性的回击。杜勒斯提出的所谓“大规模报复”的政策，不过是掩盖美国准备发动的“先发制人”的原子闪电战的侵略性质而已。美国前国防部长麦克耳罗伊在1958年4月间就公开表示，他认为对苏联的战争将是原子闪电战，他说：“进攻可能不必超过两次或三次……。而这一切是在相当短的时间内发生的……我想是在几天之内发生的”。近年以来，虽然美国已经失去了军事优势，美国的军事领袖却更多的主张所谓“以进攻代替防御”，并且为发动这种侵略战争找寻根据。美国著名的军事评论家鲍德温去年7月在透露五角大楼修订所谓“国防计划”时说，美国军事当局强调“今天的最好防御办法只有一个——进攻”。美国战略空军司令鲍尔去年在他的一本著作中，公然鼓吹对苏联发动“先发制人的战争”，他说“虽然我们先发制人的行动可能引起公开的战争，但是，这仍然不是进攻的战略，因为采取这种行动的目的是为了自卫”。美国目前正在加紧扩充它的军力，特别是狂热地发展导弹武器，正是要建立他们认为能够摧毁苏联战斗能力的力量。今年以来，美国的战略部署特别显著地按照攻击的目的进行调整。美国取消了发展“鲍马克B式”远程防御性导弹计划，削减了“奈克—赫尔克里士式”防空导弹经费，而集中力量发展如“阿特拉斯式”导弹进攻性战略武器。
    美国飞机一再侵犯苏联和其他社会主义国家领空搜集军事情报，就正是为美国对社会主义阵营进行
  “突然袭击”作准备的。上面所提到的那位美国战略空军司令鲍尔就公开说过，美国要发动战争，就必须获得某些“必然要进攻的情报”。在美国飞机最近对苏联挑衅失败以后，美国的军政负责人竟然发表这样一种议论，他们说，侵入苏联领空的美国飞机没有在边境被击落，说明美国有能力对苏联进行空袭。尽管这种说法是没有根据的，但是却暴露了美国的这种飞机挑衅活动，除了收集情报之外，还抱有试探苏联防御“突然袭击”的力量的目的。
    但是美国的负责官员包括艾森豪威尔在内，却以防止“突然袭击”作为美国对苏联进行间谍活动的借口，甚至根据这种站不住脚的借口，宣布继续要进行这样的侵略活动，美国侵略集团不仅是贼喊捉贼，而且在被捉住以后，还公开声言要继续做贼，据说还是为的是捉贼。真是可谓无耻而又无理之极。美国间谍飞机的活动。完全暴露了美国暗中积极策划对苏联和别的社会主义国家的突然袭击，教育了各国人民，促使他们对美国的侵略阴谋百倍警惕。而美国间谍飞机的被击落，也充分证明，美国如果胆敢向以苏联为首的社会主义阵营发动“突然袭击”，它也必然要遭到毁灭性的打击。
