Xinhua News Agency, Havana, May 14th: The Cuba-China Friendship Association was solemnly established in Havana, the capital of Cuba, tonight.

Participating in the founding meeting were many outstanding leaders from Cuban political, social, and cultural circles, as well as hundreds of Cuban workers, students, militia, soldiers and officers of the Rebel Army, and representatives of overseas Chinese in Cuba. They warmly expressed the close friendship between the people of Cuba and China.

Major Fore Chomón, Secretary-General of the Cuban Revolutionary Directorate, said in his speech at the meeting, "Let us extend our arms to embrace the arms extended to us by the great Chinese people, so that our two peoples, who are fighting for liberation, independence, and happiness, can be closely united in a united embrace." He emphasized that U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the Chinese people, the Cuban people, the Latin American people, and the people of the whole world. It is the enemy of the justice of the majority of poor people, and it is the merchant of war and exploitation.

Today's founding meeting was held at the Cuban Press Association, its office building decorated with huge Cuban and People's Republic of China flags and the slogan "Long live the friendship between Cuba and China."

Baldomero Álvarez Ríos, President of the Cuban Press Association, pointed out in his speech that the establishment of the Cuba-China Friendship Association is to further strengthen the friendly ties between the two peoples.

More than 300 members of the Cuban Rebel Army Youth Federation marched in front of the building with a military band to participate in the meeting and warmly celebrate the establishment of the association.

The famous Cuban poet Nicolás Guillén said at the meeting that the friendship between the Chinese and Cuban peoples is eternal. Recalling the history of the fighting friendship between the Chinese and Cuban peoples, Guillén said that from the time the first Chinese was forced or deceived into being brought to Cuba and living as a slave, he was united with the poorest strata of the Cuban people. In the struggle for our country's independence led by Martí, the Chinese were active participants.

He emphasized that in our struggle against imperialism and the Batista tyranny, the Chinese people and government have always regarded our aspirations for freedom as their own. This is because China is also fighting against the same enemy. Today, China continues to provide this assistance, which is becoming increasingly stronger and more effective.

Guillén recited a poem dedicated to the Chinese people amidst warm applause.

When the congratulatory message from Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese Association for Friendship with Latin America, was read at the founding meeting, thunderous applause broke out. During the course of the meeting, people constantly shouted the names of Mao Zedong and Fidel Castro.

Li Zaiwen, head of the Chinese trade union delegation, was also invited to attend today's meeting. In his speech, he said that the friendship between the Chinese and Cuban peoples has deep roots. Since the Cuban people, under the leadership of Castro, overthrew the U.S. imperialism-backed Batista dictatorship, the Chinese people have been constantly watching the Cuban people's struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression, defending national independence, implementing land reform, and developing the national economy. He also said that the achievements of China's socialist revolution and socialist construction are inseparable from the support and encouragement of the people of the world, including the Cuban people. I assure you that in your just struggle, the 650 million Chinese people will always stand with you. Finally, he said that with the establishment of the Cuba-China Friendship Association, we believe that in the future our two countries' cultural and economic relations will be further developed. While you are bravely and tenaciously fighting against U.S. imperialist interference and aggression, the Chinese people are fighting to liberate Taiwan, our territory occupied by U.S. imperialism. Our struggle is against a common enemy: U.S. imperialism. The noose around the neck of the U.S. imperialists is held in the hands of the Cuban people, the Chinese people, and the peace-loving people of all countries who are fighting against aggression. All the conspiracies of U.S. imperialism will surely fail, and the struggle of the Cuban and Chinese people will surely achieve final victory. The friendship between our two countries will grow and consolidate.

Li Zaiwen presented gifts to the meeting, including portraits of Chairman Mao Zedong and Chairman Liu Shaoqi.

Violeta Casals, head of the Cuban women's delegation that recently visited China, said that although the Chinese and Cuban people are geographically far apart, they are united by a common desire for progress.

Rogelio Iglesias Patiño, Deputy Secretary of Foreign Relations of the Cuban Workers' Federation, who recently returned from a visit to China, emphasized that it is the same group of people who are now invading Cuba who are occupying Taiwan, which belongs to the Chinese people, and who are invading Soviet territory: U.S. imperialism. He described the foreign delegation's meeting with Chairman Mao Zedong, saying that he also saw the Chinese people's respect and love for the Cuban revolution. Finally, he said amidst enthusiastic cheers, "Chinese brothers, here, right next to the U.S. imperialists, the Cuban people support the struggle of the People's Republic of China."

Before the end of the meeting, a documentary about the establishment of the China-Latin America Friendship Association and a film about the Chinese People's Commune were shown.

    “让我们伸出臂膀拥抱伟大的中国人民伸给我们的臂膀”
    哈瓦那隆重举行古中友协成立大会
    肖蒙少校说：美帝国主义是中国人民、古巴人民和世界人民的共同敌人
    栗再温说：六亿五千万中国人民将永远同战斗中的古巴人民站在一起
    新华社哈瓦那14日电　古巴首都哈瓦那今晚庄严地举行了古巴—中国友好协会成立大会。
    参加成立大会的有许多古巴政治、社会和文化界的杰出领袖以及数以百计的古巴工人、学生、民兵、起义军的战士和军官以及在古巴的华侨代表。他们热烈地表明了古巴、中国两国人民之间的亲密友谊。
    古巴革命指导委员会总书记福雷·肖蒙少校在大会上发言说，“让我们伸出我们的臂膀拥抱伟大的中国人民伸给我们的臂膀，使我们两国正在为争取解放、独立和幸福而斗争的人民在团结的拥抱中紧紧地联合在一起。”他强调说，美帝国主义是中国人民、古巴人民、拉丁美洲人民以及全世界人民的共同敌人，它是占大多数的贫苦人民的正义的敌人，是从事战争和剥削的商贾。
    今天的成立大会是在古巴报业同业公会举行的，它的办公大楼装饰着巨幅的古巴和中华人民共和国的国旗和标语“古巴和中国的友谊万岁”。
    古巴报业同业公会会长巴耳多梅罗·阿尔瓦雷斯·里奥斯在发言中指出，古巴—中国友好协会的成立是为了更加密切和加强两国人民的友好联系。
    古巴起义军青年联合会三百多位会员在军乐队伴奏下从大楼的前面列队前来参加大会，热烈庆祝协会的成立。
    古巴著名诗人尼古拉斯·纪廉在会上说，中国人民和古巴人民的友谊是永恒的。纪廉在追述古中两国人民历史上的战斗友谊时说，从第一个中国人被强迫或被欺骗地带到古巴，并像奴隶一样生活的时候起，他就和古巴人民最贫苦的阶层团结在一起。在马蒂领导争取我国独立的斗争中，中国人是积极的参加者。
    他强调指出，在我们反对帝国主义和巴蒂斯塔暴政的斗争中，中国人民和政府一贯把我们争取自由的热望当作他们自己的一样。这是因为中国也是为反对同一敌人而斗争。今天中国仍然继续在提供这种援助，这种援助并且日益加强和更加卓有成效了。
    纪廉在热烈的掌声中朗读了献给中国人民的诗篇。
    当在成立大会上宣读中国拉丁美洲友好协会会长楚图南的贺电时，响起了巨大的掌声。在大会进程中，人们不断地高呼毛泽东和菲德尔·卡斯特罗的名字。
    中国工会代表团团长栗再温也应邀出席了今天的大会。他在发言中说，中国和古巴两国人民的友谊有深远的渊源，从古巴人民在卡斯特罗的领导下推翻了美帝国主义扶植的巴蒂斯塔独裁政权时起，中国人民就一天也不间断地注视着古巴人民反对美帝国主义侵略、保卫民族独立、实行土地改革和发展国民经济的斗争。他又说，中国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的成就是与世界人民包括古巴人民在内的支持和鼓舞分不开的。我向你们保证，在你们的正义斗争中，六亿五千万中国人民将永远同你们站在一起。最后他说，由于古巴—中国友好协会的成立，我们相信，今后我们两国文化和经济关系将获得进一步的发展。在你们为反对美帝国主义的干涉和侵略而英勇顽强地斗争的时候，中国人民正在为解放被美帝国主义霸占的我国领土台湾而斗争。我们的斗争是为了反对共同的敌人：美帝国主义。套在美帝国主义者脖子上的绞索握在古巴人民、中国人民和全世界爱好和平为反对侵略而斗争的各国人民的手里。美帝国主义的一切阴谋必将失败，古巴和中国人民的斗争必将取得最后的胜利。我们两国间的友谊将日益发展和巩固。
    栗再温向大会赠送了礼品，其中有毛泽东主席和刘少奇主席的肖像。
    不久以前访问过中国的古巴妇女代表团团长比奥莱塔·卡萨耳斯说，尽管中国人民和古巴人民在地理上相距遥远，他们由于渴望进步的共同意愿而团结在一起。
    最近访问中国回国的古巴工人联合会对外关系副书记罗赫略·伊格莱西亚斯·帕蒂尼奥强调说，现在侵略古巴的正是霸占属于中国人民的台湾的那伙人，也正是侵犯苏联领土的那伙人：美帝国主义。他描述了外国代表团会见毛泽东主席的情况，他说，他也看到中国人民对古巴革命的敬意和热爱。最后他在热烈的欢呼声中说，“中国的兄弟们，在这里，就在美帝国主义者的身旁，古巴人民支持中华人民共和国的斗争。”
    大会结束前，放映了成立中国—拉丁美洲友好协会的纪录片和一部关于中国人民公社的电影。
