Praising the "Mother-Child Well-being Paradise"
    Hua Ren

    In the warm family of the Daye People's Commune in Dengfeng, Henan, a happy garden has been arranged for thousands of mothers and children. Here, medical care, obstetrics, early childhood education, and maternal and child health are all linked together. Mothers do not have to worry from pregnancy, childbirth, all the way until the child enters school, and can participate in production with peace of mind. People have given this new thing a name, called "Mother-Child Well-being Paradise." This name is really good!

    Here, it is not only a paradise of welfare, but also a classroom for popularizing health knowledge and a school for conducting communist education. Ten days before giving birth, mothers can stay in the delivery room of the obstetrics department and receive health knowledge education. As soon as the child is born, they enjoy collective care and are nurtured by the brilliant sunshine of communism. Here, something that Engels envisioned is beginning to sprout: "With the transformation of the means of production into social property, the individual family will no longer be the economic unit of society. Private housework will be transformed into social industry. The care and education of children will become a public matter; society will equally care for all children..." ("The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State").

    During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, people's communes were successively established in vast rural areas of our country. The establishment of the people's communes enabled a large number of women to take up production posts, and kindergartens and nurseries were also developed accordingly. The responsibility for childcare and education began to be undertaken by society on a large scale. These childcare organizations play a significant role in liberating women's labor force and educating children. With the consolidation and development of the people's communes, the rural economy is developing vigorously, and people's ideological awareness is gradually improving. This has laid the ideological and material foundation for the birth of the "Mother-Child Well-being Paradise." The "Mother-Child Well-being Paradise" integrates maternity hospitals, nurseries, kindergartens... into a whole. The childcare and education work is entirely undertaken by society from the day of birth. This kind of one-stop childcare and education organization has many advantages. First, mothers can completely get rid of the burden of children and devote themselves to production with all their strength. Second, children receive good education from an early age, which is conducive to the all-round development of morality, intelligence, and physical fitness. Third, it avoids the overlapping phenomenon of childcare organizations and achieves centralized leadership and mutual coordination, which can save more labor. Such one-stop childcare organizations exist not only in Henan Province, but also in Zhejiang, Sichuan, Heilongjiang, and other provinces. With the development of socialist revolution and socialist construction, it is conceivable that this bright flower will bloom in more places!

    At present, there are approximately 150 million children under the age of seven in our country. These 150 million children are the successors to communist construction. We should give them correct education from the time they are young. Family education is still necessary at present, but social education should also be actively and gradually strengthened. While vigorously developing childcare organizations, it is absolutely necessary to connect maternal and child health care into a network and form a complete system in areas where conditions are mature, like the Daye People's Commune. Let us learn from the spirit of the Daye people and do a better job in our early childhood education, so that mothers can participate in production with more peace of mind, and children can live a happier, more joyful, and healthier life!

    赞“母子康福乐园”
    华仁
    在河南登封大冶人民公社的温暖大家庭里，给千百个母亲和孩子安排了一个幸福的园地。在这里，医疗、妇产、幼儿教养、妇幼卫生等，都连成了一条龙，母亲从怀孕、生产，一直到孩子入学，都不用担忧，可以安心参加生产。人们给这个新生的事物，起了个名字，叫“母子康福乐园”。这个名字真好！
    这里，不仅是生活福利的乐园，也是普及卫生保健知识的课堂，进行共产主义教育的学校。母亲临产前的十天，就可住在妇产部的待产室，接受卫生知识的教育。孩子一生下来，就享受着集体的关怀，受到共产主义灿烂阳光的哺育。在这里，开始萌芽了恩格斯所展示的那样一种远景：“随着生产资料转化为社会公有，个体家庭也不会再是社会的经济单位。私人的家务将变为社会的工业。孩子的照管和教养将成为公众的事情；社会将同等地关怀一切儿童……”（“家庭、私有制和国家的起源”）。
    1958年大跃进中，我国广大农村相继建立了人民公社。人民公社的成立，使大批妇女走上生产岗位，幼儿园、托儿所也相应地得到了发展，孩子照管和教养的责任，开始大规模地由社会担当起来。这些托儿组织，不论是在解放妇女劳动力或教育孩子方面，都起着极大的作用。随着人民公社的巩固和发展，农村经济发展蒸蒸日上，人们的思想觉悟逐步提高，这就给“母子康福乐园”的诞生，奠定了思想和物质基础。“母子康福乐园”使妇产院，托儿所，幼儿园……组成了一个整体，孩子的保育和教育工作，从降生那一天起，就由社会全部承担起来。这样一条龙的保教组织，有着许多优越性。第一，母亲可以完全摆脱孩子的牵累，全力投入生产；第二，孩子从小就受到良好的教育，便于德育、智育、体育全面发展；第三，避免保教组织的重叠现象，达到集中领导、互相衔接，这就可以节省更多的劳动力。像这样一条龙的保教工作组织，不但河南省有，在浙江，在四川，在黑龙江等省也有。随着社会主义革命和社会主义建设的发展，可以想像得到，这一鲜艳的花朵，将会在更多的地方开放！
    目前，我国七岁以下的儿童，约有一亿五千万。这一亿五千万个孩子，是共产主义建设的接班人。我们应当从孩子还是幼小的时候起，就对他们进行正确的教育。家庭教育在当前仍然是必需的，但也应当积极地逐步地加强社会教育。在大力发展托儿组织的同时，在条件成熟的地区，像大冶人民公社那样，把妇幼保健工作连成网，织成套，这是完全必要的。让我们一块学习大冶人民的精神，把我们的幼儿保教工作作得更好，让母亲们都能更安心地参加生产，让孩子们过着更幸福，更愉快，更健康的生活！
