Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 17th - Major newspapers here today published dispatches from their special correspondents in Paris, exposing how the United States deliberately scuttled the Four-Power Summit.

	The "Pravda" special correspondent's commentary stated that a serious obstacle had arisen on the path to the Four-Power Summit: the aggressive policy of the United States towards the Soviet Union. The recent provocative aggressive activities by U.S. military aircraft against the Soviet Union were a deliberate attempt to undermine normal relations between countries, intensify international tensions, and scuttle the Four-Power Summit.

	The commentary pointed out that today, people have a more accurate and profound understanding: for the Soviet Union, talks are not a tool for diplomatic maneuvering, but should adhere to a policy of openness and honesty. The commentary stated that conspiracies and acts of bad faith cannot build peace. If a person extends their right hand to shake hands with someone while concealing a weapon of assassination in their left, this is treachery and not a friendly handshake.

	The commentary stated that today, no one can intimidate the Soviet Union, and only those who have lost their senses would believe they can make the Soviet Union kneel. In order for peaceful coexistence to become a political reality, imperialists must abandon their predatory policy against the Soviet Union.

	The "Pravda" reporter believes: "The road to the Four-Power Summit exists, and the problem now lies with the U.S. government."

	The "Izvestia" special correspondent, in a commentary titled "American Aggressors Scuttled the Talks," wrote that American aggressive groups fear the relaxation of tensions, and they have done everything they can to undermine the Four-Power Summit. The article pointed out that American newspapers have recently been vigorously publicizing the bleak prospects for the Four-Power Summit. The article stated: "Now it is clear that the U.S. representatives went to Paris in an attempt to obstruct the improvement of the international situation," and Eisenhower's statement once again shows that he is unwilling to conduct high-level talks in a normal, healthy atmosphere, on an equal footing.

    苏联报纸揭露美国对苏侵略方针
    美国故意葬送四国首脑会议
    据新华社莫斯科17日电　此间各主要报纸今天都发表了自己的特派记者从巴黎发回的评述文章，揭露美国在故意葬送四国首脑会议。
      “真理报”特派记者的评述说，在四国政府首脑会谈的道路上已经产生了严重的障碍，这就是美国对苏联政策的侵略方针。美国军用飞机最近对苏联进行挑衅性的侵略活动，是故意要破坏国与国之间的正常关系，使国际紧张局势加剧，葬送四国首脑会议。
    评论指出，今天，人们已经更确切地、深刻地了解到：对苏联说来，会谈不是玩弄外交手腕的工具，而应该奉行开诚布公的政策。评论说，阴谋和背信弃义的行为不能建立和平，如果一个人伸出右手同人握手而在左手里却藏着暗害的武器，这就是背信弃义而不是友好的握手。
    评论说，今天，没有人能够吓倒苏联，只有那些丧失理智的人才会以为他们可以使苏联屈膝。为了要使和平共处成为政治现实，就必须要使帝国主义者放弃他们的反对苏联的强盗政策。
    “真理报”记者认为：“通向四国首脑会议的道路是存在的，现在问题在于美国政府。”
    “消息报”特派记者在题为“美国侵略者葬送了会谈”的评述中写道，美国侵略集团害怕缓和紧张局势，他们作出了他们所能作的一切来破坏四国首脑会谈。文章指出，美国报纸最近大肆宣传四国首脑会议前景暗淡。文章说：“现在事情很明显，美国代表去巴黎是企图阻挠改善国际局势的”，艾森豪威尔的声明又一次表明，他不愿意在正常、健康的气氛中，在平等的基础上进行高级会谈。
