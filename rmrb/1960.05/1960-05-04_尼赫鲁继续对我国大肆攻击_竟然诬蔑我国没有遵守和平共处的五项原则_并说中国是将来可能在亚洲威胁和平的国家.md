Xinhua News Agency, 3rd Dispatch. According to the Indian News Service, Indian Prime Minister Nehru, in answering questions at a press conference in London on May 2, openly attacked China for "not abiding by" the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

Nehru went to London to attend the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference.

In answering a provocative question from a reporter about whether China had violated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, Nehru actually said, "I would say they have not adhered to the Five Principles."

Nehru also slandered China as a country "creating a tremendously explosive situation" and one that may threaten peace in Asia in the future. When a reporter provocatively asked whether there was any threat to world peace in Asia coming from China, Nehru actually replied, "Potentially, it exists. Actually, it is difficult to say that it doesn't exist in the immediate future." He continued, "But in the future, the consequences of the rapid growth in industry and population—it could become a billion in twenty years or so—which is creating a tremendously explosive situation, will bring certain explosive factors."

In answering reporters' questions, Nehru denied that his policy was one of neutralism. He said that if it refers to a policy of not participating in military alliances, "we feel that this is a very sound policy. Not only are we right in pursuing this policy, but in the future we should, and I hope other countries should also, pursue this policy."

    尼赫鲁继续对我国大肆攻击
    竟然诬蔑我国没有遵守和平共处的五项原则
    并说中国是将来可能在亚洲威胁和平的国家
    新华社3日讯　据印度新闻处报道，印度总理尼赫鲁5月2日在伦敦举行的一次记者招待会上答复问题时，公然攻击中国“没有遵守”和平共处的五项原则。
    尼赫鲁是到伦敦去参加英联邦总理会议的。
    尼赫鲁在答复记者所提中国是否违反了和平共处的五项原则的挑衅性的问题时，竟说，“我愿说，他们没有遵守五项原则。”
    尼赫鲁还诬蔑中国是一个“正在造成具有巨大爆炸性的局势”而且将来可能在亚洲威胁和平的国家。一个记者挑拨性地问到在亚洲是否存在来自中国的对世界和平的任何威胁，尼赫鲁竟回答说，“从潜在来说，是存在的。实际上那很难说，在最近的未来不存在”。他接着说，“但是在将来，工业上和人口——它可能在二十年或二十年左右以后成为十亿——的迅速增长所正在造成的具有巨大爆炸性的局势的后果，将带来某些爆炸性的因素”。
    尼赫鲁在回答记者问题时否认他的政策是中立主义的政策。他说，如果指的是不参加军事同盟的政策，“我们感到这是非常健全的政策。不仅我们正在奉行这个政策是正确的，而且在将来我们应当，而且我希望其他国家也应当奉行这个政策”。
