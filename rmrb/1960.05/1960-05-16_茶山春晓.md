    Spring Dawn on the Tea Mountain
    Liu Cun  Woodcut
    Lu Xiangyao　Poetry:
    At daybreak, the tea mountain is thick with morning mist,
    Distant mountains and nearby mountains overlap.
    On the mountain path, the flow of people is long,
    Tea-picking girls tread on white clouds.
    The leading captain is young,
    A blue apron tied around her chest;
    Toes kicking away the mountain mist,
    Bud after bud of tender tea are picked into the basket.
    Passing through the high-yield garden, walking through the experimental field;
    Everywhere on the tea mountain, the spring scenery is beautiful,
    Carrying full baskets of tea into the tea factory.
    The girls in the back team descend the mountain early,
    The sun has just risen on the horizon.
    Mountain songs are sung, turning the slopes green,
    Tea flowers bloom, perfuming the mountains.
    The young captain runs happily,
    Her steps like the spring breeze;
    The young captain is truly beautiful,
    Holding a bunch of azaleas in front of her blue apron. (Attached image)

    茶山春晓
    柳村  木刻
    卢祥耀　诗天微明，茶山晨雾浓，远山近山叠重重，山径道上人流长，采茶姑娘踏白云。领头的队长年纪轻，胸前结一条蓝围裙；脚尖儿踢开山上雾，一芽芽嫩茶采篮中。穿过丰产园，走过试验场；茶山处处春光好，手提着满篮茶叶进茶厂。后队的姑娘早下山，天边刚刚出太阳。山歌唱得满坡绿，茶花开来遍山香。年轻的队长跑得欢，步子像春风；年轻的队长真漂亮，蓝围裙前捧一束映山红。（附图片）
