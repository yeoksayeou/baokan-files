Expanding Highland Irrigation Projects, Striving to Overcome Drought and Ensure a Bumper Harvest
Shanxi Highland Dry Land Irrigation Area Reaches Four Million Mu
Shandong Linyi Special District Water Conservancy Projects Demonstrate Drought Resistance Power
Yunnan Xuanwei Well Drilling for Drought Resistance Achieves Significant Results

    (Reported by this newspaper) Currently, in Shanxi Province, from the Taihang and Zhongtiao Mountains in the south to the northern Shanxi Plateau, the continuous anti-drought campaign is gaining momentum. According to recent statistics, the 517 completed water lifting and high irrigation projects have transformed nearly four million mu of high-lying dry land into irrigated land.
    Shanxi Province is located on the Loess Plateau, known as the "North China Terrace." Mountainous areas account for 76% of the province. Coupled with a complex climate, it has historically been "nine droughts in ten years." After liberation, the area of irrigated land in the province has expanded greatly, but the construction of water conservancy in mountainous areas has been relatively slow. Therefore, carrying out highland irrigation work is not only a major measure to realize water conservancy in mountainous areas, but also the key to water conservancy in the whole province.
    In Shanxi Province, from September of last year to the present, there has been no thorough rain for more than 200 days, and the drought is very serious. Many mountainous communes regard the development of highland irrigation as the main measure to overcome the current drought situation, so the highland irrigation work in various places has shown a good situation of immediate success from the beginning. Of the 510 highland irrigation projects started in Jinzhong Special District this year, 128 have been used for irrigation, irrigating 1.25 million mu of highland dry land. In Jinnan Special District, a total of 507 highland irrigation projects have been completed and are under construction, of which 248 projects have been installed with machinery. In order to develop highland irrigation, the Yudaohe Irrigation Area in Fenyang County unified the planning of water sources and adopted the method of using surface water to irrigate mountains and groundwater to irrigate plains. The canal water was diverted to the highlands through water lifting projects, and mechanized wells were built in the plains to turn them into well-irrigated areas.
    In the process of carrying out highland irrigation, people's communes in various places are simultaneously carrying out large and small projects, and are diverse and adapted to local conditions. Xishe People's Commune in Jishan County, a semi-mountainous dry area, according to the local characteristics of many mountains, slopes and gullies, adopted the method of digging springs in the mountains, lifting water from the gullies, and intercepting water at high places, planning, starting construction, and irrigating the land at the same time; so that the projects, machinery, and irrigation are three coordinated. Six large-scale water lifting and high irrigation projects, six small-scale water lifting and high irrigation projects, five mountain spring digging projects, five canal diversion and long-distance irrigation projects, and 45 irrigation well projects were arranged in a unified manner. After a hundred-day battle, the highland irrigation area was expanded to more than 43,600 mu, an increase of more than seven times compared with the original irrigated area. Bai Daoguan, a member of Yangyi Commune in Taigu County, has developed a power air pressure pump suitable for highland irrigation, which has 1.5 times higher pumping efficiency than ordinary power waterwheels, and has low cost and saves steel.
    (Reported by this newspaper) In the past two years, the large, medium and small-sized mountain and water management projects built by the Linyi Special District of Shandong Province relying on the strength of the people's communes have played a huge role in drought resistance, spring sowing and wheat irrigation. As of the 6th of this month, of the 7.3 million mu of wheat in the district, 5 million mu had been irrigated with reviving water, 2.8 million mu had been irrigated with jointing and heading water; 4.2 million mu had been sown with drought resistance, accounting for 52% of the spring sowing plan.
    Relying on the strength of the people's communes, Linyi Special District built six large reservoirs with an average water storage of more than 200 million cubic meters in 1958 and 1959, cutting off the Wenliang, Xun, Yuan Gong, West Jia, and Fu Ding Rivers, which can irrigate more than 2.9 million mu of farmland, turning 500,000 mu of riverbed beaches into fertile land. In the past winter and this spring, four large reservoirs, including Bashan, Antai, Qingfengling, and Tianzhuang, have been newly built, cutting off the Yi, Shu, and Wen Rivers in one fell swoop, with a water storage capacity of 1.7 billion cubic meters. Up to now, this area has formed a relatively complete water conservancy system of storage, irrigation, and drainage, with ten large reservoirs as the backbone, plus 19 medium-sized reservoirs, 11,872 small reservoirs, more than 6,000 river diversions, and more than 140,000 ponds and dams built in recent years. A total of 4 billion cubic meters of water is controlled and stored, and the irrigation area reaches 12.5 million mu, accounting for 75% of the total cultivated land area in the district.
    (Reported by this newspaper) Xuanwei County in Yunnan Province comprehensively utilizes surface water and vigorously develops groundwater for drought resistance, which has a great enlightenment and guiding significance for the drought resistance struggle in various parts of Yunnan. Now, more than 80,000 wells have been dug in the county, so that the irrigated area of the county's 500,000 mu of large-area, high-yield corn land has rapidly expanded from 16% to 50%.
    More than 4,000 cadres, headed by the first secretary of the county party committee, went deep into the grassroots to lead well drilling. Leading cadres and the masses combined to create many new methods for capturing groundwater, such as digging dragon pools and mine tunnels, and using riverbeds to drill sand wells. The secretary of the Longtan Commune Party Committee went deep into the driest Xinhe Management District, humbly consulted with old farmers, and found a dragon pool that had been buried by a mountain collapse decades ago. Everyone dug eleven feet deep and finally dug out a groundwater source that could irrigate 400 mu of land. Through in-depth visits by cadres and mass suggestions, turning over county chronicles, and checking history, the county also discovered many coal holes and mine tunnels that accumulated groundwater, and dug more than 1,000 "artificial dragon pools."
    The rich experience created by Xuanwei County in solving irrigated corn is now being promoted throughout Yunnan Province. The province plans to dig 2 million wells to ensure that 4 million mu of corn are irrigated.

    大兴高地灌溉工程　力争战胜干旱保丰收
    山西高塬旱地浇灌面积达四百万亩
    山东临沂专区水利工程发挥抗旱威力　云南宣威打井抗旱成效显著
    本报讯　目前，山西省南起太行、中条山，北至晋北高原，持续不息的抗旱运动，越来越高涨。到最近统计，全省已完成的五百一十七处提水高浇工程，已使近四百万亩高垣旱地变成了水浇地。
    山西省地处黄土高原，素称“华北台地”。全省山区面积占76％。加以气候复杂，历来是“十年九旱”。解放后，全省水浇地面积扩大很多，但山区水利建设仍然是比较缓慢。因之，开展高地灌溉工作，不仅是实现山区水利化的重大措施，同时也是全省水利化的关键所在。
    山西省从去年9月开始到目前为止，二百多天没有下透雨，干旱现象非常严重。许多山区公社把开展高地灌溉作为战胜当前旱象的主要措施，因此各地高地灌溉工作一开始就出现了旗开得胜的大好局面。晋中专区今年动工的五百一十处高灌工程，已有一百二十八处使用灌溉，使一百二十五万亩高垣旱地得到了灌溉。晋南专区已经完成和正在施工的高灌工程共五百零七处，其中二百四十八处工程安装上机械。为了发展高地灌溉，汾阳县峪道河灌区统一规划水源，采取地上水浇山，地下水浇川的办法，通过提水工程把渠水引向高地，在平川大搞机井，变成井浇区。
    各地人民公社在开展高地灌溉中，大、小工程，同时并举；因地制宜，多种多样。稷山县半山坡旱地区的西社人民公社，按照当地山多坡多沟多的特点，采取入山挖泉、下沟提水、高处截流的办法，边规划，边动工，边浇地；使工程、机具、灌溉三配套。把六处大型提水高浇工程、六处小型提水高浇工程、五处挖山泉工程、五处并渠远浇工程、四十五眼灌井工程，统筹作了安排，经过百天大战，使高地灌溉面积扩大到四万三千六百多亩，比原有水浇地面积增加了七倍多。太谷县阳邑公社社员白道冠等制成一种适于用高地灌溉的动力气压抽水机，抽水效率比一般动力水车高一倍半，而且成本低、省钢材。
    本报讯　山东临沂专区，两年来，依靠人民公社力量建成的大中小型治山治水工程，在抗旱春播和浇麦中发挥了巨大作用。到本月6日止，全区七百三十万亩小麦，已浇返青水五百万亩，浇拔节抽穗水二百八十万亩；抗旱播种四百二十万亩，占春播计划的52％。
    临沂专区凭借着人民公社的力量，在1958年和1959年建成了平均蓄水二亿方以上的六大水库，拦腰斩断了温凉、浚、浔、袁公、西泇、傅町等六大河流，可灌溉农田二百九十多万亩，使五十万亩河床沙滩变成良田。在去冬今春又新建成了跋山、岸堤、青峰岭、田庄等四座大水库，又一举斩断了沂、沭汶河，可蓄水十七亿方。至此，这个地区以十大水库为骨干，加上近年来建成的十九座中型水库，一万一千八百七十二座小型水库，六千多处引河，十四万多座塘坝，在全区已联结成一套较完整的蓄、灌、排的水利体系。共控制蓄水量四十亿方，灌溉面积达一千二百五十万方亩，占全区耕地总面积的75％。
    本报讯　云南省宣威县综合利用地上水和大力开发地下水进行抗旱，对于云南各地的抗旱斗争，有很大的启发和指导意义。现在，全县已打井八万多眼，使全县五十万亩大面积高额丰产包谷地中，水浇面积迅速从16％扩展到50％。
    以县委第一书记为首的四千多名干部，深入基层，领导打井。领导干部和群众结合起来，创造了挖龙潭和矿洞水，利用河床打沙井等许多夺取地下水的新办法。龙潭公社党委书记深入到最干旱的新河管理区，虚心向老农请教，找出一处几十年前被大山倒塌压没的龙潭。大家挖了十一丈深，终于挖出一股可灌四百亩地的地下水来。通过干部的深入访问和群众性的献计献策，翻县志，查历史，全县还发现了许多积蓄地下水的炭洞、矿洞，挖了一千多处“人造龙潭”。
    宣威县为解决水浇包谷创造的丰富的经验，现在在云南全省推广。全省计划打井两百万眼，保证四百万亩包谷得到水浇。（田良耕）
