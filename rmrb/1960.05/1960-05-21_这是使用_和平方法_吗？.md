    Is This Using "Peaceful Methods"?
    Luoding
    To cover up Eisenhower's guilt in sabotaging the Four-Power Summit, he actually colluded with the British and French governments to jointly issue a statement, hypocritically expressing "regret" that the meeting could not be held for discussion, and even saying that "they on their part remain firmly convinced that all outstanding international issues should not be resolved through the use of force or the threat of force; but should be resolved through peaceful methods of negotiation." How eloquent and high-sounding! According to this statement, it seems that the United States opposes the threat of force, advocates peaceful consultation, and hopes to hold a Four-Power Summit, and has nothing to do with the breakdown of this meeting.
    However, Eisenhower is ultimately a complete coward. In the US-British-French statement, just like a thief afraid to go to the place where he stole something, he did not dare to touch the facts of the US plane's invasion of the Soviet Union and his rejection of Khrushchev's statement. He thought that he could cover up the eyes and ears of the world with this most clumsy trick. But facts are always facts. It was Eisenhower himself who, on the eve of the summit, sent American planes to invade Soviet airspace and carry out rampant provocations. Does this not count as a threat of force, but as "firmly" using "peaceful methods"?
    Not only that, but the United States also openly announced that this action will continue to be the US national policy. With the support of Britain and France, they did not hesitate to sabotage the Four-Power Summit and stubbornly refused to condemn this blatant act of aggression. In this way, the sweet words of the US, Britain and France that "one should not use force or the threat of force" are just another exposure of their criminal methods of threatening world peace with force.
    In fact, although Eisenhower was once forced to agree to hold the Four-Power Summit, he had always held an olive branch in his left hand and nuclear weapons in his right. Eisenhower said in the "Mutual Security Program Report": "It is quite obvious that although all possibilities of reaching reliable agreements that will reduce the danger of war must be explored, it would be extremely foolish to abandon or weaken our common deterrent position, which is an indispensable prerequisite for exploring such possibilities." However, the United States has not done a single thing in "exploring" "reliable agreements to reduce the danger of war"; but the United States has done thousands upon thousands of things in strengthening "deterrent forces" and carrying out threats of force. Not to mention the distant past, even after the US plane's invasion of the Soviet Union was exposed and condemned by the people of the world, Eisenhower still announced the resumption of underground nuclear tests, Herter clamored that the West should not have "excessive hopes" for the Four-Power Summit and should be determined to "maintain a strong defense," US Undersecretary of State Merchant clamored that the United States would continue to oppose the "status quo in Eastern and Central Europe," and the US Department of Defense even ordered a world-scale "communications alert exercise" that is "very important" only in a "state of war preparedness," and the US strategic air force and air defense forces at home and abroad were also ordered to "strengthen alert." Are all these tense war preparations and threats of force activities by the United States a sincere expression of the United States' willingness to resolve international disputes without force and the threat of force?
    The Chinese people are very clear about the American imperialists' so-called nonsense of not using force and the threat of force. May I ask, if the United States is really "firmly" willing to use "peaceful methods," then why has the United States repeatedly rejected our country's proposal not to use force or the threat of force between China and the United States in the Sino-US talks? Why doesn't the US invading army immediately get out of China's Taiwan? Why does the United States repeatedly launch military provocations in the Taiwan Strait? Why does the United States continue to invade our territorial waters and airspace? Moreover, until the eve of the scheduled Four-Power Summit, the American imperialists' threat of force against our country has not diminished but increased. Recently, the United States conducted a "Blue Star" live ammunition exercise in the South China Sea, launching "Matador" missiles, and is strengthening the "defense shield" surrounding and attacking our country. US Pacific Armed Forces Commander Felt announced that the troops under his command are "in a state of combat" and clamored that he sees no "end to the struggle." Eisenhower even openly clamored to "defend Formosa (i.e., our country's territory of Taiwan)." Look at the extent to which these activities of using force and threatening force by the United States have reached! In the face of these facts, what else can the United States' so-called non-use of force and the threat of force be, if not to cover up its vicious aggression against the Chinese people?
    Like all reactionaries, American imperialism always turns to use what it opposes when the situation is unfavorable to it, confusing people's vision and attempting to achieve its sinister goals. It uses force to occupy our country's Taiwan and threatens our country with force, which has been resolutely countered by the people of our country, putting itself in a dilemma. It then raises the banner of "non-use of force" to confuse public opinion and vainly attempt to force our country to abandon the sacred task of liberating Taiwan, so that it can permanently occupy Taiwan. Now, after threatening with force and sabotaging the summit, it has actually changed its appearance and is plotting to use the lies of "non-use of force" and "peaceful negotiations" to escape the condemnation of the people of the world and cover up its accelerated arms expansion and war preparations. However, the people of the world have long had a taste of the ugly face of American imperialism. These increasingly clumsy methods can only show the enemy's cowardice and can only show that it is shameless to the extreme. (Attached picture)

    这是使用“和平方法”吗？
    洛丁
    艾森豪威尔为了掩盖他破坏四国首脑会议的罪责，居然勾结英、法政府共同发表了一个声明，假惺惺地对这个会议不能进行讨论表示“遗憾”，还说什么“他们方面仍然坚定不移地相信，一切悬而未决的国际问题都不应该通过使用武力或以武力相威胁来解决；而应该用通过谈判的和平方法来解决”。真是振振有词而又冠冕堂皇！按照这种说法，好像美国倒是反对武力威胁，主张和平协商，希望举行四国首脑会议，而与这次会议的破裂毫不相干的了。
    可是，艾森豪威尔毕竟是十足懦怯的，他在美英法声明中，就像小偷害怕到他偷过东西的地方一样，根本不敢碰一下美机侵犯苏联和他拒绝赫鲁晓夫声明的事实。他以为用这种最拙劣的骗术，就可以掩盖世人耳目。但是事实总是事实。不是别人，正是艾森豪威尔自己在首脑会议前夕，派遣美国飞机侵犯苏联领空，进行猖狂的挑衅，难道这不算武力威胁，而是“坚定不移地”使用“和平方法”吗？
    不仅如此，美国还公开宣布这种行动仍将是美国的国策。他们在英法支持下，不惜破坏四国首脑会议，并且顽固地拒绝谴责这种明目张胆的侵略行为。这样，美英法声言的“不应该通过使用武力或以武力相威胁”的甜言蜜语，不过是又一次暴露了他们以武力威胁世界和平的罪恶的手法而已。
    其实，艾森豪威尔虽然曾经被迫同意举行四国首脑会议，但是他一直就是左手拿橄榄枝，右手拿核武器的。艾森豪威尔在“共同安全计划报告”中说：“十分明显，虽然必须探索达成将减少战争危险的可靠协议的一切可能性，放弃或削弱我们的共同威慑力量地位将是极为愚蠢的，这种力量是探索这种可能性的一个必不可少的前提”。可是所谓“探索”“减少战争危险的可靠协议”，美国并没有做过一件；但加强“威慑力量”、进行武力威胁，美国则做了千件万件。远的不去说了，就在美机侵苏事件被揭露，受到世界人民谴责之后，艾森豪威尔仍宣布恢复地下核试验，赫脱叫嚣西方不应对四国首脑会议抱“过分希望”而应决心“保持强大的防御”，美国副国务卿麦钱特叫嚷美国将继续反对“东欧和中欧的现状”，美国国防部还下令举行世界规模的、在“战争准备状态中”才“非常重要”的“通讯戒备演习”，美国在国内外的战略空军和防空部队也奉命“加强戒备”。美国这一切紧张的备战活动和武力威胁活动，也是美国愿意不以武力和武力威胁解决国际争端的诚意表现吗？
    中国人民对于美帝国主义所谓不使用武力和武力威胁之类的鬼话，是最清楚不过的。请问，美国如果真是“坚定不移地”愿意使用“和平方法”，那么，为什么在中美会谈中，美国一再拒绝我国关于中美之间不使用武力或武力威胁的建议？为什么美国的侵略军队不立即滚出中国的台湾？为什么美国要在台湾海峡一再发动军事挑衅？为什么美国要不断侵犯我国领海领空？而且，直到四国首脑会议预定召开的前夕，美帝国主义对我国的武力威胁仍有加无已。最近美国在中国南海举行了“蓝星”实弹演习，发射“斗牛士”式导弹，并正在加强包围和进攻我国的“防御盾牌”。美国太平洋武装部队总司令费耳特宣布他统率的部队“处于战斗状态”，叫嚷他看不出“斗争有什么尽头”。艾森豪威尔还公开叫嚣要“保卫福摩萨（即我国的领土台湾）”。请看，美国这些使用武力和武力威胁的活动，到了何等猖狂的地步！在这些事实面前，美国所谓不使用武力和武力威胁，难道不是为了掩盖它对中国人民的凶恶的侵略活动，还能是什么呢？
    美帝国主义和一切反动派一样，总是在形势对它不妙的时候，转而利用它所反对的东西，混淆人们的视听，妄图达到它的阴谋目的。它使用武力霸占我国台湾，以武力威胁我国，遭到了我国人民的坚决反击，使它自己处于进退维谷的时候，就抬出“不使用武力”的幌子来迷惑舆论，并妄想迫使我国放弃解放台湾的神圣任务，使它得以永久霸占台湾。现在，当着它以武力威胁，破坏了首脑会议之后，居然摇身一变，阴谋利用“不使用武力”、“和平谈判”的谎言，来逃避世界人民的谴责，掩盖它加紧扩军备战。但是，全世界人民对于美帝国主义的丑恶面目是早有领教的。这些心劳日拙的手法，只能说明敌人的懦怯，只能说明它无耻到了极点。（附图片）
