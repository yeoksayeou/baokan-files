Shuangyashan Mine's Underground Transportation Efficiency Increases Threefold

In Shuangyashan City, Heilongjiang Province, a major reform of coal mine underground transportation has dramatically increased the transportation volume fourfold and improved transportation efficiency threefold. In accordance with the spirit of "more transportation ensures high production," the Shuangyashan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party launched a technical revolution upsurge to "eliminate horse and ox harnesses and realize the mechanization of underground transportation." The city concentrated more than 1,000 electromechanical workers to tackle the problem in stages. They adopted methods that were suitable to local conditions and combined indigenous and foreign methods, such as extending the original electric locomotive lines, repairing roadways, adjusting tracks, and replacing some animal power with small winches. They quickly replaced underground animal transportation with machinery, ensuring that whatever amount of coal was produced at the mining face could be transported out.

Liaoning Exploration Team Lightens and Automates Drilling Rig

Employees of Team 106 of the Liaoning Provincial Metallurgical Geological Exploration Company have achieved the lightening and automation of drilling rigs. They adopted a method where leaders propose topics, the masses propose solutions, the masses design, the masses create, the masses diagnose, and the masses use. They reduced the weight of the original Model 500 drilling rig from 2,900 kilograms to 1,900 kilograms. They also fully automated the main procedures such as guide rods, raising and lowering drill tools, and feeding using button operation and mechanical arm operation. At the same time, they adopted a mast-type drilling tower, using a wooden pole to replace the heavy and tall iron drilling tower that had been used for nearly a century. This has basically eliminated heavy manual labor in drilling production, realizing unmanned operation on the tower, making high-altitude operations safer.

Henan Manufactures Windless Automatic Grain Winnowing Machine

The grain department of Nanyang County, Henan Province, has successfully manufactured a windless automatic grain winnowing machine using indigenous methods. The characteristics of this machine are: high efficiency, capable of winnowing 36,000 jin of grain per hour, 18 times more efficient than manual labor; simple to manufacture, generally any commune-run factory can make it; low cost, easy to obtain materials, each machine only costs about 100 yuan; easy to operate and move; because it is equipped with wheels, it can be easily pushed and moved, suitable for winnowing in busy farming seasons, and also suitable for grain depot turning and sorting.

Jixi County Builds Raw Material Base for Silk Reeling Industry

Jixi County, Anhui Province, engages in large-scale cooperation between industry, agriculture, and commerce to systematically expand the mulberry garden base, enabling the silk reeling industry to obtain more and more raw materials, and the silk production has also increased year by year. It increased by more than one time in 1957 compared to 1956, again by one time in 1958 compared to 1957, and by 70% in 1959 compared to 1958. Because the silk reeling factory has solved the raw material problem locally, it has now developed from a small factory into a large-scale silk reeling factory and is moving towards a joint enterprise.

Shaanxi Indigenous Fertilizer Plants Can Produce More Than 200 Products

More than 2,000 county-run and commune-run small-scale indigenous fertilizer plants and chemical plants in Shaanxi Province are developing towards comprehensive utilization and multiple varieties. At present, the products of small-scale indigenous fertilizer plants have at least five varieties, and the most have reached more than 200 varieties. These include ammonium sulfate, calcium magnesium phosphate fertilizer, superphosphate, three acids, chlortetracycline, etc. These fertilizers, pesticides, and chemical raw materials produced using relatively simple indigenous methods have played a significant role in supporting industrial and agricultural production. When Hanzhong City was engaged in large-scale water conservancy construction last winter and this spring, it needed a large amount of explosives. The city's small-scale chemical plant produced more than 290 tons of fire nitrate in just two months, which, in addition to meeting the local water conservancy construction needs, also supported more than 90 tons to other areas.

Qianzhan People's Commune Chemical Plants Form Comprehensive Utilization Cooperation Network

The six commune-run small-scale chemical plants of the Qianzhan People's Commune in Changchun City have formed a comprehensive utilization cooperation network to recycle raw materials and make the most of everything. For example, after the Red Flag Chemical Plant extracts ammonia water from ammonium nitrate and lime, it hands over the waste liquid and waste residue to other factories to produce products such as ammonium chloride, sodium sulfate, potassium nitrate, and crystalline mirabilite. Other factories also hand over their used waste residue and remnants to relevant factories, so that the output value of each factory has generally increased.

Every Process Learns from Advanced Techniques and Catches Up with Famous Brands

The Changzhou Cotton Textile Factory organized a "three-way combination" group of leading cadres, workers, and technicians to go to the Shanghai Pacific and Cuizhong factories to learn advanced experiences in the production of bed sheets and towels. From the sizing process of raw yarn entering the factory, to design weaving, bleaching and dyeing, printing, ironing, and packaging, every process was patiently learned, and every process was resolutely surpassed. After five days and nights of hard work, by April 29, the product quality had been greatly improved, and some indicators had already caught up with famous brands such as "414" and "Pacific."

    要闻快报
    双鸭山矿井下运输效率猛增三倍
    黑龙江省双鸭山市狠抓煤矿井下运输大改革，使井下运输量翻了两番，运输效率提高三倍。中共双鸭山市委根据“多运保高产”精神，掀起了“消灭马、牛套子，实现井下运输机械化”的技术革命高潮。全市集中了一千多名机电工人分期分批围攻突击，他们采取延长原有电机车线路、整修巷道、调整轨道和以小型绞车代替部分畜力等因地制宜、土洋结合的办法，很快就用机械代替了井下畜力运输，做到了采煤场子产多少煤就能运出多少煤。
    辽宁一勘探队钻机轻便化自动化
    辽宁省冶金地质勘探公司一○六队职工实现了钻机轻便化、自动化。他们采取领导提课题，群众提方案、群众设计、群众创造、群众会诊、群众使用的方法，把原来重达二千九百公斤的500型钻机减轻到一千九百公斤，并使导杆、升降钻具、提行等主要工序全部实现了电钮操作和机械手操作。同时，他们又采用桅杆式钻塔，用一根木杆代替了沿袭近百年的笨重高大的铁钻塔。这样就基本上消除了钻探生产的笨重体力劳动，实现了塔上无人操作，高空作业就更安全了。
        河南制成无风自动扬粮机
    河南省南阳县粮食部门用土法制造成功无风自动扬粮机。这种机器的特点是：工效高，每小时能扬粮三万六千斤，比人工提高十八倍；制造简单，一般社办工厂都能制；造价低，取材容易，每部机器只需一百元左右；易操作，活动方便；因为装有轮子，可以随便推动转移，适用于农忙时扬场，也适用于粮仓翻晒整理。
      绩溪县建缫丝工业原料基地
    安徽省绩溪县工、农、商业大协作，有计划地扩建桑园基地，使缫丝工业得到越来越多的原料，丝的产量也逐年上升。1957年比1956年增长一倍多，1958年又比1957年增长一倍，1959年比1958年增长70％。缫丝厂因为就地解决了原料问题，现在已由一座小厂发展成大型的缫丝厂，并正向联合企业迈进。

    陕西省二千多个县办、社办的小型土化肥厂和化工厂，正在向综合利用和多品种方向发展。目前小型土化肥厂的产品最少有五种，最多的已达到二百多种。其中包括硫铵、钙镁磷肥、过磷酸钙、三酸、金霉素等。这些用比较简单的土办法生产出来的化肥、农药和化工原料等，对支援工农业生产起了很大的作用。汉中市去冬今春大搞水利建设时，需要大量的炸药，该市的小型化工厂只用了两个月的时间，就生产出二百九十多吨火硝，除满足本地水利建设需要外，还支援了外地九十多吨。
  站前公社化工厂组成综合利用协作网
    长春市站前人民公社的六个社办小型化工厂，组成综合利用协作网，循环利用原材料，作到物尽其用。如红旗化学厂用硝铵、石灰提取氨水以后，把废液、废渣交给其它厂使用，生产出氯化氨、硫酸钠、硝酸钾、结晶芒硝等产品。其它各厂也把自己用过的废渣残料交给有关厂使用，使各厂的产值普遍增加。
          道道工序学先进赶名牌
    常州棉纺织厂组织了领导干部、工人和技术人员的“三结合”小组，前往上海太平洋和萃中两厂学习生产被单、毛巾的先进经验。从原纱进厂的浆纱工序开始，到设计织造、漂染印花、烫平包装，道道工序耐心学，道道工序坚决超。经过五昼夜的奋战，到4月29日，产品质量就有很大提高，有些指标已经赶上了“四一四”和“太平洋”等名牌。
