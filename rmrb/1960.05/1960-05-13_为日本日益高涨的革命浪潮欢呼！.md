    Hail the Rising Tide of Revolution in Japan!
    By Tian Han

    In recent years, the Japanese people have waged a series of struggles against the oppression of US imperialism and the reactionary rule of its puppet, the Kishi Nobusuke government. These struggles have become increasingly revolutionary and mass-based. In particular, after the victorious revolution of the South Korean people who drove away Syngman Rhee and eliminated Lee Ki-poong, the Japanese people have gained more courage and confidence. They say, "Syngman Rhee is finished, you're next, Kishi Nobusuke!" What a powerful voice! The Japanese people's sixteenth unified struggle aims to prevent the ratification of the new US-Japan Security Treaty, dissolve the Diet, and remove Kishi Nobusuke from power. The ranks of the struggle will expand from hundreds of thousands and millions to more than 20 million. Their struggle has further raised the awareness of the Japanese people, strengthened the revolutionary momentum, strengthened the unity of the Japanese revolutionary forces, and won the support of progressive people around the world, especially the support of the Chinese people. We believe that the Japanese revolutionary people will achieve their goals.

    The Japanese people's anger against US imperialism and domestic reactionaries cannot be suppressed. We have heard that when Comrade Guo Moruo's "Qu Yuan" was performed by the Japanese Zenshinza Theater Company, Japanese audiences shouted "Murphy, get out!" when they saw the scene of Zhang Yi and the Queen of Chu conspiring to frame Qu Yuan. Murphy, this schemer, was then the US Ambassador to Japan. The audience saw Zhang Yi and thought of Murphy, who was conspiring with the Japanese reactionary government to frame Japanese progressives. Later, "Guan Hanqing" had a similar situation in Japan. Performers and audiences alike associated Guan Hanqing's opposition to the rulers' oppression of the people and destruction of progressive culture with the current situation of the Japanese people. Recently, when the color film "Lin Zexu," donated by China to Japanese peace organizations, was screened in Japan, the Japanese audience felt a strong sense of empathy for the Chinese working people's anti-British struggle a hundred years ago, because they are suffering from the oppression and exploitation of US imperialism. Like the anti-British struggle of the Cantonese people, they are erupting in a fierce anti-US imperialist struggle. They expressed infinite sympathy for Lin Zexu's dismissal, and they also shouted their own slogan "Yankees, get out!" while watching the film. But they firmly believe that their struggle will not repeat the fate of the Guangzhou Pingying Tuan and Lin Zexu, because their greatest happiness is having the leadership of the vanguard of the Japanese proletariat, the strong unity of the Japanese progressive forces, and the support of progressive people all over the world, especially their close neighbor—the 650 million Chinese people standing behind them.

    The Japanese people's movement against the ratification of the new US-Japan Security Treaty and the overthrow of the US imperialist lackey Kishi Nobusuke has been developing more and more widely and deeply to a higher stage. The edge of the movement is like a prairie fire, like a surging wave, impacting the imperialist reactionaries.

    Under this new revolutionary situation, it is impossible not to produce revolutionary literature and art. We have seen the progressive tendencies of the Japanese literary and art circles through the visiting performances of the "Zenshinza". We will see a more direct reflection of the Japanese people's struggle for liberation from the upcoming performances of the Japanese theater groups visiting China.

    As colleagues across the sea, I believe that Japanese writers and artists will rise up in unison, breathe and share the fate of the fighting Japanese people, use better works to welcome this great revolutionary wave and promote this revolutionary wave. The Japanese people's struggle for democracy, independence, and peace will achieve victory more quickly, and a new era will emerge in Japanese new literature and art.

    为日本日益高涨的革命浪潮欢呼！
    田汉
    几年来，日本人民为了反对美帝国主义的压迫和它的驯服走卒岸信介政府的反动统治，进行了一系列的斗争，这些斗争一次比一次带着革命性和广大群众性。特别是最近南朝鲜革命人民胜利地赶走了李承晚，消灭了李起鹏之后，更增加了日本人民的勇气和自信，他们说：“李承晚完蛋了，下一次就是你了，岸信介！”这是多么有力的声音！日本人民的十六次统一斗争，正是以不许批准美日新安全条约，解散国会，赶岸信介下台为目的。斗争的队伍将由几十万几百万扩大到两千多万。他们的斗争进一步提高了日本人民的觉醒，壮大了革命的声势，加强了日本革命力量的团结，获得全世界进步人类的支持，特别是中国人民的支持。我们相信，日本革命人民一定会达到他们的目的。
    日本人民反抗美帝和本国反动派的怒火是抑制不住的。我们听说过，当郭沫若同志的“屈原”由日本前进座剧团演出的时候，日本观众看到张仪与南后阴谋陷害屈原的场面时，曾高呼“墨菲滚回去！”墨菲这位阴谋家那时是美国驻日大使，观众看到张仪，却想起与日本反动政府阴谋陷害日本进步人士的墨菲。后来“关汉卿”在日本演出也有同样的情形，演出者与观众都把关汉卿反对统治者压迫人民、摧残进步文化跟日本人民今天的处境相联系。最近中国赠给日本和平机构的彩色影片“林则徐”在日本放映时，日本观众对百年前中国劳动人民的反英斗争也激起强烈的同感，因为他们正受着美帝国主义的压迫和剥削，他们和广东百姓的反英斗争一样爆发着如火如荼的反美帝的斗争，他们对林则徐的被黜寄以无限同情，他们在看这片子时也喊出了自己的口号“美国佬滚回去！”但他们深信自己的斗争不会重复广州平英团和林则徐的命运，因为他们最幸福的是有了日本无产阶级先锋队的领导，有日本进步力量的坚强团结和全世界进步人类的支援，首先是他们的紧邻——六亿五千万中国人民站在他们后面。
    日本人民反对批准日美新安全条约和打倒美帝走狗岸信介的运动，已经一天天广泛深入地向更高阶段发展，运动的锋芒像燎原的烈火，像澎湃的怒涛，向帝国主义反动派冲击。
    在这个革命的新形势下，不可能不产生革命的文艺。我们曾由“前进座”的访华演出，看出日本文艺界的进步倾向，我们将更由即将访华的日本话剧团体的演出看到日本人民解放自己的斗争的较直接的反映。
    作为海这一边的同行，我相信日本作家们艺术家们会一致奋起，与战斗的日本人民同呼吸共脉搏，用更好的作品来迎接这个巨大的革命浪潮并推动这一革命浪潮，日本人民为民主，独立，和平的斗争将更快地取得胜利，日本新文艺也将出现一个新时代。
