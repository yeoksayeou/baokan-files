Xinhua News Agency, 16th dispatch: Winter wheat in the Huanghuai area, China's major wheat-producing region, has entered the crucial period of heading, flowering, and grain filling. Encouraged by the slogan "Don't stop managing wheat fields until the harvest is in," various regions are increasing their efforts and implementing measures to break through the final stage of wheat field management, aiming for larger ears of wheat and fuller grains, to achieve a bumper wheat harvest.

This year, the winter wheat in the Huanghuai area has successfully passed the overwintering tillering, greening, and jointing stages due to good planting and meticulous management. According to reports from various regions, this year's wheat is growing better than in any previous year, with uniform and robust growth, promising a great harvest. Provinces such as Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu have timely proposed to break the mindset that harvest is predetermined during this final crucial stage of wheat growth. They are managing wheat until it is stored in the granary, organizing labor, and launching a new upsurge in late-stage processing and management of wheat fields, engaging in overproduction competitions. Henan, Hebei, and Shanxi are carrying out the "Five Catch-ups" and "Three Overshoot" movements, including mountainous areas catching up with plains, distant areas catching up with nearby areas, barren land catching up with fertile land, late-sown crops catching up with early-sown crops, and third-class seedlings catching up with first-class seedlings, as well as drive exceeding measures, measures exceeding targets, and actual output exceeding contracted output. In provinces like Henan, Hebei, and Shaanxi, Party secretaries from the provincial to county to commune and brigade levels are personally taking charge and commanding the late-stage management of wheat fields. First secretaries of local and county Party committees in Shaanxi Province are going deep into the fields or working in the fields, commanding the progress of late-stage wheat field management. In Hebei Province, 10,000 Party committee secretaries at all levels from the Handan, Shijiazhuang, and Tianjin special districts and cities are going deep into the front lines of production to lead wheat field management. Various regions have also further strengthened the labor force for wheat field management to aggressively tackle the late-stage management challenges.

In the late-stage management of wheat fields, all regions are focusing on the fact that wheat needs fertilizer and water most at this stage, and that wheat is prone to pests and diseases at this stage. They are vigorously pursuing topdressing, irrigation, pest and disease control, and eliminating third-class seedlings. Since last winter, there has been less rainfall in Henan, Shandong, Hebei, Shanxi, and other provinces, and most wheat fields are relatively dry. These provinces have launched a late-stage processing and management campaign centered on drought resistance, focusing on water and fertilizer to strive for larger ears and heavier grains of wheat. Henan Province organized more than 7.7 million laborers to resist drought, irrigate wheat, and apply topdressing. More than 11 million mu of wheat in the province have been irrigated with water for jointing and heading, more than 55 million mu have been topdressed, and more than 50 million mu have been cultivated. Hebei Province also organized more than 5 million people to join the battle to resist drought and protect wheat. By the 5th, more than 18 million mu of wheat in the province had been irrigated, more than 17 million mu had been topdressed, and more than 23 million mu had been cultivated.

Recently, wheat rust, scab, armyworms, wheat midges, wheat spider mites, and other pests and diseases have occurred in some areas of Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Shaanxi, Jiangsu, Anhui, and other provinces. Party organizations at all levels in these provinces are leading the masses to vigorously carry out pest and disease control work. Henan Province has established more than 10,000 pest and disease prediction and forecasting stations (points) and organized 34,000 professional teams, self-producing more than 100 million jin of various native pesticides. As soon as rust occurred, the entire province mobilized 5 million people to vigorously control it, and 16 million mu of rust-affected areas have been treated, basically one round of universal prevention and control, of which the Kaifeng Special District has universally treated the 2 million mu of diseased wheat fields twice. Shaanxi Province is vigorously carrying out rust detection and eradication campaigns. Rust has occurred in more than 2 million mu of wheat fields, and more than 5 million mu-times have been treated, effectively controlling the spread of rust.

Many areas are also vigorously eliminating third-class seedlings, besieging low-yielding fields, and striving for large-scale balanced increase in wheat production. Due to the measures taken to vigorously eliminate third-class seedlings in Anhui Province, the proportion of third-class wheat seedlings in the province has decreased from 11% in the previous stage to 5%. Tang County, Hebei Province, inspected third-class seedlings block by block, row by row, accepted them, set up markers, and processed and managed them carefully, upgrading most of the third-class seedlings. After irrigating the third-class wheat fields in Dongjiao Commune, Licheng County, Shandong Province, and applying 20 jin of ammonium sulfate per mu, the number of ears per plant and the number of grains per ear have significantly increased compared to before irrigation and topdressing.

### 麦子一日不收　管理一日不停  黄淮流域各省加强小麦后期管理力争实产超包产

    麦子一日不收　管理一日不停
    黄淮流域各省加强小麦后期管理力争实产超包产
    据新华社16日讯　我国主要产麦区的黄淮流域各省冬小麦已进入抽穗、扬花和灌浆的关键时期。各地在“麦子一日不收，管理一日不停”的口号鼓舞下，加干劲、加措施，决心攻破麦田管理最后一关，使麦穗长得更大，麦粒长得更饱满，争取小麦获得大丰收。
    今年，黄淮流域各地冬小麦由于种得好，管理精细，胜利渡过了越冬分蘖、返青和拔节关。据各地反映，今年小麦长得比过去任何一年都好，麦子生长的整齐健壮，大丰收的胜利在望。河北、山东、河南、陕西、山西、安徽、江苏等省，在小麦生长的最后这个关键时期，都及时地提出打破收成定局论，管麦管到麦入仓，并组织劳力，掀起一个麦田后期加工管理新高潮，大搞超产竞赛。河南、河北、山西开展了山区赶平原，远地赶近地，瘦地赶肥地，晚茬赶早茬，三类苗赶一类苗和干劲超措施，措施超指标，实产超包产的“五赶”、“三超”运动。河南、河北、陕西等省从省到县，到社队各级党委书记亲自挂帅，指挥麦田后期管理工作。陕西省各地委、县委的第一书记深入田间或是到田间办公，坐阵指挥麦田后期管理工作的进行。河北省邯郸、石家庄、天津三个专区、市有各级党委书记一万名，深入生产第一线，领导麦田管理工作。各地还都进一步加强了麦田管理的劳力，来猛攻后期管理关。
    各地在麦田后期管理中，都根据小麦后期最需要肥料和水分，以及小麦后期容易遭受病虫侵害的特点，大抓追肥、浇水、防治病虫害和消灭三类苗。河南、山东、河北、山西等省，去冬以来，落雨较少，大部分麦田比较干旱，这些省都开展了以抗旱为中心的麦田后期加工管理运动，攻水攻肥，争取小麦穗大，粒重。河南省组织七百七十多万劳力，抗旱浇麦、追肥，全省小麦已浇拔节抽穗水的有一千一百多万亩，追肥的有五千五百多万亩，中耕的有五千多万亩。河北省也组织了五百多万人投入抗旱保麦战斗，到5日止，全省小麦有一千八百多万亩已浇了水，追肥的有一千七百多万亩，中耕的有二千三百多万亩。
    最近，河南、河北、山东、陕西、江苏、安徽等省部分地区发生小麦锈病、赤霉病和粘虫、吸浆虫、麦蜘蛛等病虫为害。这些省的各级党组织，正领导群众大力进行防治病虫的工作。河南省建立病虫预测、预报站（点）一万多个，组织专业队三万四千个，自制各种土农药一亿多斤。锈病一发生，全省就出动五百万人大力防治，现已防治锈病一千六百多万亩，基本普遍防治了一遍，其中开封专区已把发病的二百多万亩麦田普遍防治了两遍。陕西省大力开展查锈病、灭锈病运动，麦田发生锈病的有二百多万亩，已防治五百多万亩次，有效地控制了锈病的蔓延。
    许多地区还大抓消灭三类苗，围攻低产田，力争小麦大面积平衡增产。安徽省由于采取措施大抓消灭三类苗，全省小麦三类苗已由前阶段的11％下降为5％。河北省唐县对三类苗块块检查，垅垅验收，树立标记，加工细管，使大部分的三类苗升了级。山东省历城县东郊公社给三类麦田浇了水，每亩追施了二十斤硫铵后，每株穗数和每穗的粒数，都比没有浇水追肥前有了显著的增加。
