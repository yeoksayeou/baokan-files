The incident of the American plane's intrusion into Soviet airspace not only exposed the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism once again, but also exposed the shameless, robber-like face of U.S. imperialism once again.

After Soviet Chairman Khrushchev revealed the American act of aggression on May 5th, the U.S. State Department issued a statement that same day, flatly denying it, saying that the American plane that violated Soviet airspace "might" have been a "civilian meteorological reconnaissance plane," and that "possibly the pilot lost consciousness due to the failure of oxygen equipment," which led to an "accidental intrusion into Soviet airspace." The Washington robbers apparently thought that since the plane was destroyed and the pilot dead, no one could prove them wrong, and they could simply deny it. Unexpectedly, the evidence was irrefutable, proving that the American plane had entered Soviet airspace for espionage activities. This put the American authorities in a very awkward position. After much deliberation, officials at the U.S. State Department issued another statement on May 7th, admitting on the one hand that the American plane had collected military intelligence over the Soviet Union, and on the other hand, offering new "reasons" to quibble, which this time seemed even more shameless than the last.

First, the U.S. State Department stated that this was an "unauthorized" flight. The American propaganda machine annotated this point: "Possibly the pilot acted on his own initiative." This sophistry by the American authorities is too clumsy. It should be known that the American plane that intruded into the Soviet Union this time was not an ordinary plane, but a special type of U-2 high-altitude plane specifically for military reconnaissance, which was directly controlled by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. The pilot who flew this plane was a CIA spy. He received orders and made thorough preparations to carry out this military reconnaissance mission. All of this was confessed by the captured American pilot. The American authorities' so-called "unauthorized" statement is like a murderer telling people: "It wasn't me who killed, it was my hands." Isn't this the most typical robber logic?

The U.S. State Department's statement, after admitting to espionage activities against the Soviet Union, even described this espionage activity as a "legitimate defense measure," and that due to the Soviet Union's "extremely excessive secrecy," the United States needed to increase this espionage activity. This statement not only completely exposes the so-called "unauthorized" claim as nonsense, because it is a "legitimate defense measure"; moreover, what is even more noteworthy is that the United States openly uses "defense" as an excuse to conduct espionage activities against other countries, infringe on other countries' airspace, without feeling ashamed, and even justifies itself. This arrogant and unreasonable attitude truly pales all the old-fashioned imperialists in comparison. But here it reveals a truth, which is that in the mouth of U.S. imperialism, all acts of aggression and expansion are called "defense," and its "defense" is aggression. Even sending planes to intrude into other countries' airspace can be called a "legitimate defense measure," then what American "defense" is not aggression? Moreover, according to the American statement, because the Soviet Union does a good job of keeping secrets, the United States is even more necessary to send planes to intrude into the Soviet Union for espionage activities, which is equivalent to saying that the American aggression is completely "legitimate." This is like a thief saying, "Because you have money, I must steal." Isn't this also robber logic?

What is even more shameless is that the American authorities even resorted to rogue tactics, saying that "all countries are engaged in intelligence gathering activities," and even counter-attacked, slandering the Soviet Union for "not lagging behind in this regard." When a rogue's true colors are revealed, the last resort is always to play this trick: "I am a bad guy, but you are not good people either." However, can playing this trick make the faces of the American aggressors any brighter? Everyone knows that the United States has been exposed countless times for conducting espionage and sabotage activities against other countries. Even officials at the U.S. State Department admit that in the past ten years, American planes have intruded into the Soviet Union at least thirteen times. But they cannot cite a single instance of the Soviet Union doing such a thing to the United States or other countries. Empty accusations only show that the United States is at a loss for words.

The two statements by the U.S. State Department have exposed the rogue face of U.S. imperialism without reservation. The first statement is a complete lie, and the second statement is shameless quibbling. It should be pointed out that this is not the first time the United States has used such rogue tactics, it has always been the case. Lying and quibbling are the true colors of U.S. imperialism. People remember that during the Korean War, the United States carried out bacteriological warfare against our country, which was verified by the actual investigation of international legal workers and scientists, but the American authorities still stubbornly refused to admit it. Again, more recently, American planes have been constantly bombing Cuban cities and towns, but the American authorities never admit their guilt. After a plane that intruded into Cuba to smuggle agents was caught, the United States even announced a so-called indictment by a federal grand jury, falsely claiming that this was "deliberately arranged" by the Cuban government. The American pilot Pope, who participated in the armed rebellion in Indonesia and bombed Indonesian cities, actually said that he was engaged in "good work to assist other countries in independence" and was "obeying the orders of his superiors to assist Indonesia, which was threatened by communism." Anyway, all kinds of aggressive acts are denied with all kinds of excuses. And the rogue attitude shown by the United States in this incident of invading Soviet airspace is even more naked. If anyone has not completely seen through the true face of U.S. imperialism, now they should understand that all the sweet words of the United States are not to be trusted at all, they are just a cover for its aggressive activities.

    强盗的嘴脸
    文湖
    美国飞机侵犯苏联领空的事件，不仅再一次暴露了美帝国主义的侵略本性，同时也再一次暴露了美帝国主义的无耻的强盗的嘴脸。
    在苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫同志于5月5日揭露了美国的侵略行动以后，美国国务院当天就发表了一个声明，矢口抵赖，说什么侵犯苏联领空的美国飞机“可能”是一架“民用气象侦察机”，“可能由于氧气设备的失灵使得这个驾驶员失去了知觉”，以致“偶然地侵犯了苏联领空”。华盛顿的强盗们显然以为反正机坠人毁，死无对症，完全可以就此赖过去。没想到人赃俱获，证实了美国飞机是进入苏联领空进行间谍活动的。这一下可把美国当局弄得狼狈万状，美国国务院的官员们经过一番苦思，于5月7日又发表了一个声明，一方面不得不承认了美国飞机在苏联上空搜集军事情报，另一方面则拿出新的“理由”来进行狡赖，而这次比上次显得更加无耻。
    首先，美国国务院声明，这是一次“没有授权”的飞行。美国的宣传机器对于这一点作了注解：“可能是这个驾驶员自己主动进行的”。美国当局的这种诡辩是太拙劣了。须知这次侵入苏联的美国飞机，不是普通飞机，而是特种类型的专供军事侦察用的Ｕ—2型高空飞机，是美国中央情报局直接掌握的。这次驾驶这架飞机的飞行员是美国中央情报局的间谍，他接受了命令，并且为了执行这次军事侦察任务，曾经作了周密的准备。这些都是那个落网的美国飞行员供认不讳的。美国当局的所谓“没有授权”的说法，等于一位杀人犯告诉人们：“杀人的不是我，是我的双手”。这不是最典型的强盗逻辑是什么？
    美国国务院的声明在承认了对苏联进行间谍活动之后，竟把这种间谍活动说成是“正当的国防措施”，而由于苏联“极为过份的保密作法”，美国有必要增加这种间谍活动。这种说法不但完全揭穿了所谓“没有授权”是鬼话，因为这是“正当的国防措施”；而且，更使得人们注意的是，美国公然以“国防”为借口，对别国进行间谍活动，侵犯别国的领空，而不以为耻，还振振有词，这种蛮横无理的态度，真是使一切老牌的帝国主义为之逊色。但是这里却揭示了一个真理，这就是在美帝国主义口中，一切侵略扩张活动都叫做“防御”，它的“防御”就是侵略。连派遣飞机侵犯别国领空都可以叫做“正当的国防措施”，那还有什么美国的“防御”不是侵略的呢？而且照美国的说法，由于苏联保密做得好，美国就更有必要派飞机侵入苏联进行间谍活动，那就等于说，美国的侵略活动是完全“正当”的了。这犹如一个贼说，“因为你有钱，所以我必需偷”。这不又是强盗的逻辑么？
    更无耻的是，美国当局甚至大耍无赖，说什么“所有的国家都在进行搜集情报的活动”，而且还反咬一口，诬蔑苏联“在这方面也是不落后的”。流氓在原形毕露的时候，最后就总是耍这么一招：“我是坏蛋，但是你们大家也不是好东西”。但是，耍了这一招就可以使美国侵略者的面子光彩一些吗？谁都知道，美国对其他国家进行间谍、破坏活动已经不知多少次被揭发过。连美国国务院的官员也承认，过去十年中，美国飞机至少有十三次侵犯苏联事件。但是他们却举不出一件苏联对美国或者其他国家所作的这种事情来。空口诬赖只表明美国的理屈词穷而已。
    美国国务院的两个声明，把美帝国主义一副流氓相暴露无遗。第一个声明是彻头彻尾的扯谎，第二个声明是无耻的耍赖。应当指出，美国耍这种流氓手段，这并不是第一次，一贯就是如此。扯谎和耍赖是美帝国主义的本色。人们记得，美国在侵朝战争期间，对我国进行了细菌战，是经过国际法律工作者和科学家的实际调查证实了的，但是美国当局还是死不认账。又再如最近以来，美国飞机不断轰炸古巴的城乡，但是美国当局却从不认罪。有一架侵入古巴偷运特务的飞机被捉住后，美国竟然还公布什么联邦大陪审团的起诉书，诬赖这是古巴政府“故意安排”的。参与印度尼西亚武装叛乱、轰炸印度尼西亚城市的美国飞行员波普，居然说什么他是从事“协助其他国家独立的良好工作”，是“遵守上峰的命令，援助已受共产主义威胁的印度尼西亚”。反正各种各样的侵略行为，用各种各样的借口来抵赖。而美国在这次侵犯苏联领空事件上所表现的流氓的态度就更是赤裸裸的了。假如有什么人曾经没有完全看穿美帝国主义的真面目的话，现在也应该明白，美国的一切花言巧语是毫不足信的，都不过是掩盖它进行侵略活动的幌子而已。（附图片）
