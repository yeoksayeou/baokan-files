Xinhua News Agency Dispatch—Communist parties in Western European countries have successively condemned the United States for provoking the Soviet Union and disrupting the Four-Power Summit.

The Central Committee of the German Communist Party issued a statement saying that the Four-Power Government Heads of State Conference did not take place, and this should be blamed on the advocates of the "Cold War" and the militarists in Washington and Bonn. Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers Khrushchev's position in Paris safeguarded the interests of the people of all countries.

The statement by the Central Committee of the German Communist Party was published in today's "Neues Deutschland" and has been broadcast by "German Free Radio 904."

The Central Committee of the German Communist Party pointed out, while exposing the West German ruling clique's aggressive policy, that their current attempt is to cancel the restrictions imposed on West Germany by the Paris Accords regarding the production of atomic, bacteriological, and chemical weapons, and to turn West Germany into an atomic rocket war arsenal. The statement pointed out that the residents of West Germany should strive for peace and the easing of tensions in the struggle against aggressive militarism.

The statement by the Central Committee of the German Communist Party emphasized that, thanks to the strength of the Soviet Union, the socialist camp, and the worldwide peace movement, the era of militarists and warmongers running rampant is gone forever. The forces of peace far outweigh the forces of warmongers. This is what the provocateurs in Washington and Bonn must remember.

Rome News: Italian Communist Party General Secretary Togliatti issued a statement on the 19th regarding the incident of the United States sending spy planes to invade the Soviet Union and deliberately sabotaging the Four-Power Government Heads of State Conference, emphasizing that the people of all countries in the world must always maintain a high degree of vigilance, continuously and resolutely carry out struggles, overwhelm the instigators of war, and defend world peace.

In an interview with a reporter from "National Evening News," Togliatti said that the US plane provocation incident showed: First, the United States deliberately violated Soviet airspace, which is to say, deliberately violated Soviet sovereignty. Second, the United States brazenly declared that they had the right to do so and intended to continue to use this so-called "right." However, this right does not exist and cannot exist. Respect for territory and sovereignty is the recognized starting point and necessary prerequisite for international relations for centuries.

The Italian Communist Party General Secretary then emphasized the fact that, just as the Paris Conference was about to be held, the United States conducted a world-scale exercise in preparation for war, which means that the United States had no serious intention of conducting peaceful negotiations. On the other hand, Eisenhower refused to publicly recognize the principle of national sovereignty. This attitude constitutes an insurmountable obstacle to the start and continuation of any negotiations.

Togliatti said: In the Western camp, especially in the United States, in the highest military and political institutions, there are groups whose habit and profession is war provocation. Everything the Soviet Union did in Paris exposed the activities of these groups, putting them in a position of being condemned by the world.

Togliatti concluded: "The world's march towards socialism has not stopped, and the strength of the socialist camp is so significant that even the most stubborn war instigators have to find it thorny. The peaceful aspirations of the people of all countries in the world can overwhelm them. Undoubtedly, this requires a high degree of constantly maintained vigilance and strong, continuous action, so that the entire masses are involved in the struggle for peace."

The Vienna Party Organization of the Austrian Communist Party held a grand rally in Vienna on the 20th to condemn the United States for disrupting the Four-Power Government Heads of State Conference. The Secretary of the Vienna Party Organization of the Austrian Communist Party, West, spoke at the meeting. He emphasized that the US imperialists should be held responsible for disrupting the summit meeting.

The Danish Communist Party organ "Land and People's Daily" refuted US Secretary of State Herter's slander at the North Atlantic Group Permanent Representatives Meeting on the 19th, accusing the Soviet Union of disrupting the Four-Power Government Heads of State Conference, pointing out that this "is purely a shameless and hypocritical statement."

The newspaper emphasized: "The United States has shown, both in words and deeds, that it is unwilling to ease tensions, unwilling to hold a summit meeting, and unwilling to coexist peacefully."

    西欧各国共产党怒斥美国挑衅
    德共中央发表声明谴责美国破坏四国会议
    陶里亚蒂强调提高警惕动员群众争取和平
    据新华社讯　西欧各国共产党纷纷谴责美国对苏联挑衅和破坏四国首脑会议的行为。
    德国共产党中央委员会发表声明说，四国政府首脑会议没有开成，这应当由“冷战”拥护者和华盛顿以及波恩的军国主义者负责。苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在巴黎采取的立场维护了各国人民的利益。
    德国共产党中央委员会的这个声明发表在今天的“新德意志报”上，并且已经由“德国九○四自由广播电台”广播。
    德国共产党中央委员会在揭露西德统治集团的侵略政策时指出，现在他们的企图就是要取消巴黎协定规定的在生产原子武器、细菌武器和化学武器方面对西德的限制，并且把西德变成原子火箭战争的军火库。声明指出，西德居民应当在反对侵略性的军国主义的斗争中争取和平和紧张局势缓和。
    德国共产党中央委员会的声明强调说，由于苏联、社会主义阵营和全世界争取和平运动的强大，军国主义者和战争贩子横行霸道的时代已经一去不复返了。和平的力量大大超过了战争贩子的力量。这是华盛顿和波恩的挑拨者必须记住的。
    罗马消息：意大利共产党总书记陶里亚蒂19日就美国派遣间谍飞机侵略苏联蓄意破坏四国政府首脑会议一事发表谈话，强调世界各国人民必须始终保持高度的警惕，持续不断地进行坚决的斗争，压倒战争挑衅者，保卫世界和平。
    陶里亚蒂向“国家晚报”记者发表谈话时说，美国飞机挑衅事件表明：第一、美国故意侵犯了苏联的领空，也就是故意侵犯了苏联的主权。第二、美国悍然宣称他们有权这样做，并且打算继续使用这种所谓“权利”。然而这种权利是不存在的，也是不能存在的。对领土和主权的尊重，这是好多世纪以来公认的国际关系的出发点和必需的前提。
    意共总书记接着强调指出这个事实：正当巴黎会议即将举行的时候，美国来了一次世界规模的备战演习，这就是说，美国毫无严肃认真地进行一次和平谈判的意愿。另一方面，艾森豪威尔拒绝公开承认国家主权的原则。这种态度构成了对开始和继续进行任何谈判的不可逾越的障碍。
    陶里亚蒂说：在西方阵营，特别是美国，在军事和政治的最高机构中，存在着以战争挑衅为习惯和职业的集团。苏联在巴黎所作的一切，使这些集团的活动被揭露了，使它们处于受到全世界谴责的境地。
    陶里亚蒂最后说：“世界向社会主义前进的步伐没有停止，社会主义阵营的力量是如此不可忽视，甚至最顽强的战争挑衅者也不得不感到棘手。世界各国人民的和平意愿能够压倒他们。毫无疑问，这就必须有高度的、始终保持的警惕和坚强的、持续不断的行动，从而使全体群众投入争取和平的斗争。”
    奥地利共产党维也纳党组织20日在维也纳举行盛大集会，谴责美国破坏四国政府首脑会议。奥地利共产党维也纳党组织书记韦斯特在会上讲了话。他强调指出，美帝国主义者应对破坏最高级会议负责。
    丹麦共产党机关报“国土与人民报”驳斥美国国务卿赫脱19日在北大西洋集团常任代表会议上诬蔑苏联破坏四国政府首脑会议时指出，这“纯粹是一种无耻的虚伪的说法。”
    这家报纸强调说：“美国不论是从言论方面还是行动方面都表明它是不愿意缓和，不愿意举行最高级会议，也不愿意和平共处。”
