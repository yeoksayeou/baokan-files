Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 17th: In the past four days, 600,000 people in various parts of northern Korea have held rallies and demonstrations to support the Japanese people's struggle against the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

　　Following the 200,000-person rally in Pyongyang on the 14th to support the Japanese people's struggle, more than 60,000 citizens of Kanggye City, Jagang Province, also held a demonstration. They shouted slogans such as "Abolish the U.S.-Japan Military Alliance Treaty!" and "U.S. imperialists, get out of South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and South Vietnam immediately!"

　　At a mass rally held before the demonstration, Jeong Seong-hyeop, chairman of the Jagang Province Committee of the General Federation of Korean Trade Unions, pointed out in his speech that if the Kishi Nobusuke group disregards the peaceful aspirations of the Japanese people and the people of all countries and forces the Diet to pass the U.S.-Japan Military Alliance Treaty, it will be digging its own grave. They will not escape the fate of figures like Tojo, Hitler, and Syngman Rhee.

Representatives from all walks of life expressed their firm support for the 16th National Unified Action of the Japanese people against the U.S.-Japan Military Alliance Treaty in their speeches at the rally, and emphasized that the Korean people will support the common struggle of the Japanese people against U.S. imperialism and Japanese militarism with new achievements in socialist construction.

    在示威以前举行的群众大会上，朝鲜职业总同盟慈江道委员会委员长郑圣侠讲话时指出，如果岸信介集团无视日本人民和世界各国人民的和平愿望而强使国会通过日美军事同盟条约，这是它自掘坟墓。它们将逃不脱东条、希特勒和李承晚之流的命运。
