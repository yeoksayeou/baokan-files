Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 21st. The Soviet "Naval Gazette" published a commentator's article on the 20th, exposing the US Chief of Naval Operations, Burke's, recent conspiratorial activities in the Baltic Sea region. The commentator pointed out that Burke's conspiratorial activities in the Baltic Sea region, which is close to the Soviet Union, actually embody the plundering plans of international reactionaries and imperialists, and embody their shameful plans to break into other people's homes.

The commentator pointed out that US Admiral Burke recently visited Denmark, Sweden, and Norway. His visit to Denmark was not only as a plenipotentiary representative of the Pentagon, but also as a representative of the Naval Command.

The commentator wrote that everyone knows that the leaders of the West German Navy have long attempted to put their noose around Denmark's neck, thereby seizing the Danish Navy. This plan was drafted in Bonn, approved by Washington, and finalized during Admiral Burke's recent visit to West Germany.

The commentator emphasized that it was precisely for this purpose that large-scale naval exercises were held in the northern Baltic Sea, under the command of West German naval generals, during Burke's visit to the Baltic Sea region.

    在接近苏联地区
    美国进行海军演习
    新华社21日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联“海军报”20日发表评论员文章，揭露美国海军作战参谋长伯克最近在波罗的海地区的阴谋活动。评论员指出，伯克在靠近苏联的波罗的海地区进行阴谋活动，实际体现了国际反动派和帝国主义者的掠夺计划，体现了他们企图闯进别人的大门的可耻计划。
    评论员指出，美国海军上将伯克最近曾经到过丹麦、瑞典和挪威。他到丹麦去的身份不仅是五角大楼的全权代表，而且还是海军司令部的委派人物。
    评论员写道，大家都知道，西德海军的领导人早已企图把他们的套索套在丹麦头上，从而把丹麦海军抓到自己手里。这一计划是在波恩起草、经华盛顿批准，并在海军上将伯克不久以前访问西德时最后定案的。
    评论员强调指出，正是由于这一目的，所以在伯克访问波罗的海地区时，在西德海军将领们的指挥下，在波罗的海北部举行了大规模的海军演习。
