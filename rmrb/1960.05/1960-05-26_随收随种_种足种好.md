Editorial: Harvest and Plant Simultaneously, Plant Sufficiently and Well

    Spring planting has victoriously concluded in most parts of the country, and the agricultural season is about to enter the busy stage of summer harvesting and summer planting. The current task of the agricultural front is to prepare diligently for summer harvesting and summer planting while doing a good job in wrapping up spring planting, so as to achieve harvesting as crops ripen, and planting immediately after harvesting, harvesting one plot as soon as it ripens, and planting one plot immediately after harvesting, ensuring timely sowing and sufficient and good planting of summer crops.

    This year, the area of various summer crops has generally been expanded compared to previous years, with the total planting area accounting for about a quarter of the year's total. Summer crops include grains, oilseeds, and many industrial raw material crops. Among them, the grain planting area accounts for about 30% of the year's total grain planting area, oilseeds account for more than one-third of the year's total oilseed crop area, and industrial raw material crops also account for a considerable proportion. Most summer grain crops are high-yield crops such as rice, corn, and sweet potatoes. Most summer oilseed crops are soybeans and sesame. Soybeans are not only an important export commodity for our country, but also an indispensable non-staple food and edible oil raw material in the lives of the broad masses of people in our country; sesame oil is one of the edible oils beloved by the Chinese people. Therefore, taking all kinds of effective measures to ensure timely sowing, sufficient and good planting of summer crops is of decisive significance for striving for a bumper harvest in autumn and realizing the continued leap forward in agriculture throughout the year.

    Striving for more planting is the primary requirement of this year's summer planting work.
  "It's hard to harvest one hundred *shi* if you don't plant one hundred *mu*," this saying aptly illustrates the close relationship between planting more and harvesting more. We must do everything possible to expand the summer planting area, improve the multiple cropping index, and plant as much as possible in areas where multiple planting is possible. This year, the planting area of overwintering crops has increased by more than 110 million *mu* compared to last year, and the early rice area has also increased compared to previous years, which provides favorable conditions for increasing the summer planting area this year. Up to now, a large amount of wasteland has been reclaimed throughout the country, and some areas are continuing to reclaim wasteland, which is another favorable condition for expanding the summer planting area. These newly reclaimed wastelands, which have not yet been planted in the spring planting, should be planted in the summer, striving to harvest in the same year that the wasteland is reclaimed. All localities should also continue to mobilize the masses to utilize various scattered plots of land, making use of every available space, and planting all usable land with grains, melons, vegetables, or other crops. In short, the potential for expanding the summer planting area is great, and as long as there is a great revolutionary spirit and ways are found to tap the potential, more planting and more harvesting can be achieved.

    Expanding the summer crop planting area must be closely combined with increasing the yield per unit area. Planting more and harvesting more must go hand in hand with high-yield and more harvesting in order to promote the continued leap forward in agricultural production. Under the guidance of this principle, the first priority is to strive for good planting. This mainly includes two aspects: timely sowing and improving the quality of sowing. Experience has shown over the years that timely sowing can greatly increase yields, which is an important measure for increasing summer crop production. When is the "timely" time to sow? Different places have different natural conditions, each with its own timely sowing period. But in general, many of those that were considered "timely" in the past were not actually timely, and most of them were too late. The sowing period of summer crops should be appropriately advanced, as early sowing can ensure that crops have sufficient growing periods, thus potentially increasing yields, and can also free up the stubble earlier, striving for timely sowing of winter wheat or early autumn plowing. Therefore, all areas with the conditions should try to achieve simultaneous harvesting and planting, harvesting one plot and planting one plot. Improving the quality of sowing means acting in accordance with the "Eight-Point Charter" for agricultural production, and better and more comprehensively implementing the "Eight-Point Charter" in summer planting. All summer crops this year should be applied with sufficient base fertilizer, selected with fine varieties, planted with reasonable close planting, and plowed and leveled the land, and so on. If all of these are achieved, it can be said that the goal of improving the quality of sowing has been achieved and the requirement of planting well has been fulfilled. Planting well is the first hurdle to increasing yield per unit area, and overcoming this hurdle lays a solid foundation for striving for a bumper harvest.

    Of course, there are certain difficulties in achieving timely sowing and sufficient and good planting, such as relatively tight labor, and insufficient seeds and fertilizers in some places, and so on. However, as long as the possible difficulties are foreseen and preparations are made in advance, the difficulties can be completely resolved and overcome. Chairman Mao raised a very famous slogan during the revolutionary war: "Fight no battle unprepared, fight no battle you are not sure of winning." We strictly followed this instruction and overcame the great difficulty of the enemy being strong and we being weak, and finally defeated the enemy. In his famous speech "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" in 1955, Chairman Mao mentioned this slogan again, asking us to apply this slogan "to the work of building socialism." Chairman Mao instructed at the time: "To be sure of winning, you must be prepared, and you must be fully prepared." We should conscientiously implement Chairman Mao's instruction and make all preparations before the summer planting. The summer planting period is a busy season for summer harvesting and summer hoeing, and coupled with the large summer planting area and high quality requirements this year, labor and animal power are tight, and the work is heavy. In addition to vigorously carrying out tool reform and rationally arranging labor, it is even more necessary to make summer planting preparations early before the busy season.

    This year's summer planting preparations are generally earlier and tighter than in previous years, and many areas made arrangements as early as before the spring planting. However, it cannot be said now that all areas have made sufficient preparations. It is understood that at present, some communes and production teams still have insufficient summer planting seeds and fertilizers. Therefore, all localities should immediately conduct a comprehensive inspection of the seeds, fertilizers, tools, etc. required for summer planting, to see if the existing preparations are commensurate with the summer planting tasks. Sufficient seeds and seedlings must be prepared. If there are insufficient seeds, they should be adjusted and solved as soon as possible. A small number of places that are still not enough after adjustments in this area will be given the necessary support from other places. If the fertilizer preparation is insufficient, a mass campaign of crash accumulation and fertilizer production should be launched in conjunction with the current production. Not only should sufficient fertilizer be prepared, but also strive for time to transport the fertilizer to the fields and borders as early and quickly as possible.

    There are many favorable conditions for successfully completing this year's summer planting task. The rural people's communes have become more consolidated and sound after rectification; the relationship between cadres and the masses has become closer; the continuous increase in farmland capital construction and the vigorous development of the tool reform movement have greatly improved the material and technical conditions; the state's support for agriculture is increasing; and especially, the prospect of a summer harvest has further encouraged the broad masses of commune members to strive for a bumper harvest this year with confidence and drive. As long as we make full use of these favorable conditions and make the preparations for summer planting more sufficient and more thorough, this year's summer planting will definitely be completed more, faster, and better.

    随收随种　种足种好
    春播在全国大部分地区已经胜利结束，农事季节即将进入夏收夏种的大忙阶段。当前农业战线的任务是，在做好春播扫尾工作的同时，努力做好夏收和夏种准备工作，以便作到随熟随收，随收随种，熟一块收一块，收一块种一块，保证夏种作物适时播种，种足种好。
    今年各种夏种作物一般都比往年有所扩大，总的播种面积要占全年播种面积四分之一左右。夏种作物中包括粮食、油料和很多种工业原料作物。其中粮食播种面积约占全年粮食播种面积30％左右，油料占全年油料作物面积三分之一以上，工业原料作物也占相当大的比重。夏种粮食作物大部分是水稻、玉米和甘薯等高产作物。夏种油料作物绝大部分是大豆和芝麻。大豆既是我国重要的出口物资，又是我国广大人民生活中不可缺少的副食品和食油原料；芝麻油更是我国人民所喜爱的食油之一。因此，采取各种有效措施，千方百计地保证夏种作物适时播种，种足种好，对于争取秋季大丰收，实现全年农业的继续跃进，具有决定的意义。
    力争多种，是今年夏种工作中第一位的要求。
  “不种百亩，难打百石”，这句农谚正说明了多种和多收的密切关系。我们一定要千方百计地扩大夏种面积，提高复种指数，凡是有条件多种的地区，都要尽量多种。今年越冬作物播种面积比去年扩大一亿一千多万亩，早稻面积也比往年有所扩大，这就给今年增加夏种面积提供了有利条件。到目前为止，全国已开垦了大量荒地，有的地区还在继续开荒，这是扩大夏种面积的另一个有利条件。这些新开垦的荒地，在春播中还没有播种的，都应当在夏季种上，争取当年开荒当年收。各地还应该继续发动群众利用各种零星土地，见缝插针，把一切可以利用的土地都种上粮食、瓜菜或其他作物。总之，扩大夏种面积的潜力很大，只要有一股很大的革命干劲，想方设法挖掘潜力，就能做到多种多收。
    扩大夏季作物播种面积和提高单位面积产量必须密切结合起来，多种多收和高产多收同时并举，才能促进农业生产的继续跃进。在这个方针指导下，首先要全力争取种好。这主要包括两个方面：适时播种和提高播种质量。各地多年来经验证明，适时播种能大大提高产量，这是夏种作物增产的一项重要措施。什么时候播种才算“适时”呢？各地自然条件不同，各有各的适时播种期。但一般说来，过去认为“适时”的，有许多是并非适时的，其中的多数又是偏晚的。夏种作物的播种期应该适当提早提前，早种可以保证作物有足够的生长期，因而可能提高产量，又可以早日腾出茬口，争取冬小麦适时播种或及早秋耕。所以，凡是有条件的地区，都应该尽量做到随收随种，收一块种一块。提高播种质量就是按照农业生产“八字宪法”办事，就是在夏种中更好更全面地贯彻“八字宪法”。今年的全部夏种作物，要施足底肥，要选用良种，要合理密植，要翻耕和平整土地，等等。这些都作到了，就可以说达到了提高播种质量的目的，实现了种好的要求。种好，是提高单位面积产量的第一关，这一关过好了，就为争取丰收打下了坚实的基础。
    要作到适时播种和种好种足，当然有一定的困难，比如劳力比较紧张，有些地方种子、肥料不足，等等。但是，只要预见到可能发生的困难，提早做好准备工作，困难是完全可以解决和克服的。毛主席在革命战争时期提过一个很著名的口号：“不打无准备的仗，不打无把握的仗。”我们严格按照这个指示办事，克服了敌强我弱这个对我们来说是极大的困难，最后战胜了敌人。1955年毛主席在“关于农业合作化问题”的著名讲话中，又提到了这个口号，要我们把这个口号“用到建设社会主义的工作中来”。毛主席当时指示说：“要有把握，就要有准备，而且要有充分的准备。”我们应该认真执行毛主席这个指示，在夏种之前做好一切准备工作。夏种期间正是夏收、夏锄的紧张季节，加上今年夏种面积大，质量要求高，劳力、畜力紧张，工作是繁重的。这除了大搞工具改革、合理安排劳动力以外，更需要把夏种准备工作提早在大忙季节之前做好。
    今年夏种准备工作，一般比往年抓得早、抓得紧，许多地区早在春播之前就作了安排。但是，现在还不能说，所有地区准备工作都已经做得很充分了。据了解，目前有一部分公社和生产队，夏种种子和肥料准备还不足。因此，各地应该立即对夏种所需要的种子、肥料、工具等，普遍进行一次检查，看现有的准备工作同夏种任务是否相适应。种子、秧苗必须备足。种子不足的，要及早调剂解决，经过本地区调剂还不够的少数地方，再由外地给以必要的支援。肥料准备不足的，要结合当前生产，开展群众性的突击积肥造肥运动。不仅要准备好足够的肥料，还要争取时间尽早尽快地把肥料运到地头、地边。
    胜利完成今年夏种任务的有利条件是很多的。农村人民公社经过整社更加巩固和健全了；干部和群众的关系更加密切了；农田基本建设的不断增加和工具改革运动的蓬勃开展，物质技术条件大大改善了；国家对农业的支援越来越多；特别是夏季丰收在望，更加鼓舞了广大社员争取今年大丰收的信心和干劲。只要我们充分运用这些有利条件，把夏种的准备工作做得更充分更周到，今年夏种一定能完成得又多又快又好。
