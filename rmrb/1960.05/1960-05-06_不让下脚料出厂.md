    No Scraps Allowed to Leave the Factory
    Workers at the Beijing Food Factory proposed that only raw materials should enter the factory, and no scraps should leave, so that the flesh, peel, core, and kernels of fruits could all be utilized.

    In the past, after making juice, the leftover peels and residue were transported out and discarded. After vigorously promoting comprehensive utilization, the workers tried every possible way to utilize even the pomelo peel, using the pomelo pith to make jam. This factory also utilizes tangerine peel to distill tangerine oil, and uses rotten tomatoes and rotten fruit to make alcohol; they also use grape skins to make natural pigments to replace the pigments often used in food.

    不让下脚料出厂
    北京市食品厂的职工提出只许原料进厂，不许下脚料出厂，把水果的肉、皮、核、仁全部利用起来。
    过去做完果汁之后，剩下来的皮和渣子，都运出去扔掉。大搞综合利用以后，职工千方百计想办法，已经把柚子皮也利用起来，用柚棉做成了果酱。这个厂还利用桔皮蒸桔油，用烂番茄、烂果子做酒精；还用葡萄皮制成天然色素，代替食品里经常使用的色素。
