Promoting Agricultural Production and Solving Labor Conflicts
Houzihe Commune's Commune-Run Industry Achieves Great Development
Last Year's Total Output Value Was 2.7 Times More Than Qinghai Province's Total Industrial Output Value Before Liberation

(By our newspaper) Qinghai Province, Xining City, Houzihe Commune's commune-run industry has exerted tremendous power in this year's spring plowing and sowing. At present, the commune's eighty-nine agricultural implements, ironware, and carpentry factories have formed a complete agricultural implement manufacturing and repair network.

Under the unified leadership of the commune's Party committee and adhering to the principle of serving agricultural production in every way, these factories have manufactured a large number of iron hoes, iron picks, plowshares, and various agricultural implements and transportation tools since December of last year, basically meeting the needs of spring plowing production; they have equipped each laborer in the commune with a wheelbarrow and each draft animal with a cart, achieving transportation vehicleization. At the same time, the commune's fifty-eight fertilizer plants have also produced 6.89 million jin of various types of local fertilizers such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.

These commune-run industries have played a significant role in supporting agricultural technical transformation. The commune's agricultural implement factory and iron and carpentry factories created and imitated forty-four kinds of improved agricultural implements last year, such as the three-purpose seeder (seeding, fertilizing, and watering), compactor, manure spreader, ridger, and deep plowing plow, increasing work efficiency by three to ten times. This year, they have created new agricultural implements such as vegetable seeders and broad bean seeders. At the same time, according to the requirements of high efficiency and good quality in spring plowing and sowing, all twelve horse-drawn seeders in the commune were modified. After the modification, the livestock used for traction was reduced from at least eight to two, and the manpower was reduced from three to two, while the sowing efficiency was increased by three-quarters. Currently, these factories are producing a batch of tools needed for field management such as weeding, while ensuring the needs of spring plowing production tools. The original fertilizer plants are preparing to expand into chemical fertilizer and pesticide plants and are actively trial-producing "666" pesticide powder.

Before the Great Leap Forward in 1958, Houzihe Agricultural Cooperative only had a few iron and carpentry groups, and production tools had to be purchased from other places; after the establishment of the People's Commune, the entire commune expanded and built 185 factories in just one year. Last year, the total output value of commune-run industry reached 4 million yuan, accounting for 30.9% of the commune's total income, an increase of 5.7 times compared to the advanced cooperative in 1958; it was 2.7 times more than the total industrial output value of Qinghai Province (excluding folk handicraft output value) of 1.07 million yuan during the reactionary rule of Ma Bufang before liberation.

    推动农业生产　解决劳力矛盾
    后子河公社社办工业大发展
    去年总产值比解放前青海省工业总产值多二点七倍
    本报讯　青海省西宁市后子河公社社办工业，在今年春耕播种中发挥了巨大威力。目前，全社的八十九个农具、铁工、木工厂，已经形成了完整的农具制造修配网。
    这些工厂在公社党委的统一领导下，本着一切为农业生产服务的原则，从去年12月以来，已制造了大量铁铣、铁镐、犁铧等各种农具和运输工具，基本上满足了春耕生产的需要；为全社每个劳动力配备一辆手推车，每头役畜配备有一辆大车，实现了运输车子化。同时，全社五十八个肥料厂还生产了氮、磷、钾等各种土化肥六百八十九万斤。
    这些社办工业在支援农业技术改造方面起了重大作用。公社的农具厂和铁、木工厂，去年创造和仿制了三用播种机（播种、施肥、浇水）、镇压器、撒粪机、打埂器、深翻犁等四十四种改良农具，提高工效三倍到十倍，今年又创造了蔬菜播种机、蚕豆播种机等新式农具。同时，还根据春耕播种工效高、质量好的要求，把全社所有的十二行马拉播种机全部改装。经过改装的播种机，牵引所用的牲口由原来最少八头减到两头，人力由原来的三人减到两人，播种效率却提高了四分之三。目前，这些工厂在保证春耕生产工具需要的基础上，又生产了一批除草等田间管理所需的工具。原有的肥料厂，准备扩建为化肥农药厂，正在积极试制“六六六”药粉。
    1958年大跃进以前，后子河农业社只有几个铁工、木工小组，生产工具都要从外地购买；人民公社建立以后，仅在一年的时间里，全公社就扩建和新建了一百八十五个工厂，去年一年社办工业总产值就达到四百万元，占全社总收入30.9％，比1958年高级社时增长了五点七倍；比解放前马步芳反动统治时期全青海省工业总产值一百零七万元（不包括民间手工业产值）还多二点七倍。
