Reported by our newspaper: After U.S. President Eisenhower sabotaged the Four-Power Summit, the heads of government of the United States and the United Kingdom have left Paris.

Eisenhower shamefacedly left France on the morning of the 19th to visit Portugal. According to Western news agencies, the atmosphere at the airport was cold, and most of those seeing Eisenhower off were Western journalists. In a statement released at the airport, Eisenhower self-consolingly said that he believed the "Western allies" were now standing together "more closely" than in the past. Eisenhower arrived in Lisbon that morning.

British Prime Minister Macmillan returned to London on the afternoon of the 19th.

On the afternoon of the 18th, the heads of state of the United States, Britain, and France held a meeting at the Élysée Palace. According to White House Press Secretary Hagerty, the three heads of state listened to a report from their foreign ministers on the situation of the meeting of the three foreign ministers.

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization Permanent Council held a meeting in Paris on the morning of the 19th. It was reported that U.S. Secretary of State Herter spoke at the meeting, admitting that the United States had been conducting espionage flights over the Soviet Union "for four years," emphatically emphasizing the "necessity" of this aggressive action, and slanderously accusing the Soviet Union of sabotaging the summit conference. After the meeting, the group issued a statement, echoing Herter's tune, and reversed black and white by insisting that "Khrushchev's position made negotiations in Paris impossible."

    艾森豪威尔黯然离法
    赫脱再次叫嚷间谍飞行有“必要性”
    本报综合报道　在美国总统艾森豪威尔破坏了四国首脑会议后，美国、英国政府首脑已经离开巴黎。
    艾森豪威尔在19日清晨灰溜溜地离开法国飞往葡萄牙访问。据西方通讯社报道，机场气氛冷落，为艾森豪威尔送行的大部分是西方记者。艾森豪威尔在机场发表的一个声明中自慰地说，他相信“西方盟国”目前比过去“更密切地”站在一起。艾森豪威尔当天上午到里斯本。
    英国首相麦克米伦已在19日下午回伦敦。
    在18日下午，美英法三国首脑曾在爱丽舍宫举行了一次会议。据白宫新闻秘书哈格蒂说，三国首脑在会上听取了他们的外长们关于三国外长会议的情况汇报。
    北大西洋集团常任理事会19日上午在巴黎举行了会议。据报道，美国国务卿赫脱在会上发言，承认美国对苏联的间谍飞行“已进行了四年”，极力强调这种侵略行动的“必要性”，并且诬蔑苏联破坏首脑会议。会后，这个集团发表了一项声明，随着赫脱的调子，颠倒黑白地硬说“由于赫鲁晓夫的立场使巴黎的谈判成为不可能”。
