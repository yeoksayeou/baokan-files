Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, 30th -- According to TASS, the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee held a meeting today. It is reported that the meeting discussed the issue of issuing a communique regarding the adjournment of the meeting until June 7th.

    The head of the Soviet delegation, Zorin, pointed out that the meeting failed to reach an agreement on the wording of the communique. The representatives of the Western countries disagreed with the inclusion in the communique of the point that there was a clear convergence of views on some of the issues discussed by the committee. They also disagreed with the point that the members of the committee believe that after the adjournment, it is necessary to continue negotiations in order to formulate the basic principles and plans for complete and thorough disarmament under effective international supervision, in accordance with the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly on November 20, 1959, regarding complete and thorough disarmament.
    The representatives of Britain, France, and Canada could not provide any tenable arguments to justify their rejection of the draft communique proposed by the delegations of socialist countries.
    The representatives of Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Bulgaria expressed regret at the Western representatives' refusal to accept the final communique summarizing the work of the committee over the past month and a half.
    The head of the Soviet delegation, Zorin, pointed out in his speech that the Western delegations' rejection of the communique on the adjournment of the committee meeting, as well as the objections they raised during the discussions, could only be seen as their desire to sharpen the situation to a certain extent. At the same time, this shows their attempt to avoid fulfilling the statements and proposals made by the Western representatives themselves during the committee meetings.
    Zorin, summarizing the work of the meeting, said that the Disarmament Committee had ample opportunity to immediately complete the task it was undertaking—to formulate feasible methods for achieving complete and thorough disarmament as quickly as possible, thereby realizing the resolution unanimously adopted by all member states of the United Nations at the Fourteenth General Assembly.
    However, from the very beginning, two different lines emerged in the committee's discussions. One was the line pursued by the delegations of the socialist countries, which was to implement the United Nations General Assembly's resolution on complete and thorough disarmament and to reach an agreement on a specific plan for complete and thorough disarmament. The other was the line adhered to by the delegations of the Western countries—members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization—which was very far from the goal of complete and thorough disarmament. In fact, this was a line that replaced disarmament with supervision and caused the disarmament negotiations to regress.
    Zorin pointed out that it was precisely the Soviet plan that possessed all the necessary elements for implementing the United Nations General Assembly resolution, stipulating the complete destruction of all material means of waging war.
    The starting point of the Soviet plan was that all measures for complete and thorough disarmament must be implemented under effective international supervision. At the same time, the scope and nature of the supervision must, in any case, be consistent with the scope and nature of the disarmament measures to prevent supervision without disarmament or disarmament without supervision.
    The Soviet delegation was willing to consider all revisions and supplements to the Soviet plan and expressed its agreement to place the measures for universal reduction of nuclear armaments in the first stage of the disarmament plan.
    The Western countries evaded detailed discussions of the Soviet plan, refused to begin drafting a treaty on complete and thorough disarmament, and put forward their own so-called "plan for complete and broad disarmament."
    Zorin said that the Western plan showed the Western countries' attempt to evade genuine disarmament, to emasculate the substance of the disarmament plan, and to reduce everything to the issue of supervision. This plan ran counter to the United Nations General Assembly's resolution on complete and thorough disarmament.
    Zorin pointed out that the Western delegations' attempt to use their plan of replacing disarmament with supervision to oppose the Soviet plan for complete and thorough disarmament had created serious difficulties for the work of the committee. Even so, in order to make progress in the negotiations, the delegations of the socialist countries suggested that, as the first step in formulating a plan for complete and thorough disarmament, an agreement should first be reached on the basic principles of such disarmament, and put forward corresponding proposals on April 8.
    However, the Western countries continued to adhere to their negative line and hurriedly issued statements expressing their opposition, even refusing to discuss the basic principles of complete and thorough disarmament. Zorin pointed out that the Western countries wanted to use their so-called "plan for complete and broad disarmament" to conceal from world public opinion their unwillingness to implement the United Nations General Assembly's resolution on complete and thorough disarmament. Zorin warned that the Western path would not work. Complete and thorough disarmament is not empty talk. All mankind is concerned about the successful implementation of complete and thorough disarmament.
    Zorin concluded by saying: We will resume our negotiations after the adjournment. He expressed that the Soviet Union will continue to work to ensure the success of the negotiations on a specific plan for complete and thorough disarmament.
    The French representative, Moch, made a brief final statement, saying that he believed that continuing negotiations on the current basis would be futile. He expressed the hope that the upcoming summit conference of heads of government might lay a new foundation for the continuation of negotiations.

### 东西方十国裁军委员会休会  佐林指责西方逃避真正的裁军

    东西方十国裁军委员会休会
    佐林指责西方逃避真正的裁军
    法国代表说在现有基础上继续谈判是无益的
    新华社30日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦29日讯：十国裁军委员会今天举行了会议，据透露，这次会议讨论了就会议休会到6月7日一事发表一项公报的问题。
    苏联代表团团长佐林指出，会议未能就公报的条文达成协议。西方国家代表团的代表们不同意在公报中列入这点：在委员会所讨论的某些问题上，双方观点有了明显的接近。他们也不同意这样一点：委员会各成员认为，在休会之后，有必要继续谈判，以便根据联合国大会1959年11月20日关于全面彻底裁军的决议，拟订在有效的国际监督下的全面彻底裁军的基本原则和计划。
    英国、法国和加拿大的代表拿不出任何站得住脚的论据来说明他们拒绝接受社会主义国家代表团提出的公报草案是有理由的。
    波兰、罗马尼亚、捷克斯洛伐克和保加利亚的代表对西方代表拒绝接受总结委员会过去一个半月来的工作的最后公报，表示遗憾。
    苏联代表团团长佐林在发言中指出，西方代表团拒绝委员会会议休会公报的作法以及他们在讨论过程中所发表的反对意见，只能被认为是他们希望使局势在一定程度上尖锐起来。同时，这表明他们企图避不履行西方代表自己在委员会会议过程中曾经发表的声明和提出的建议。
    佐林总结会议的工作说，裁军委员会有充分的可能立即完成它所担负的任务——尽速制订实现全面彻底裁军的切实可行的方法，从而实现联合国全体会员国在第十四届大会上一致通过的决议。
    但是，从一开始，在委员会的讨论中便出现了两条不同的路线。一条是社会主义国家的代表团所执行的路线，这是贯彻联合国大会关于全面彻底裁军的决议并且就全面彻底裁军的具体计划达成协议的路线。另一条就是西方国家——北大西洋公约组织成员国的代表团所坚持的路线，这条路线离全面彻底裁军的目标非常遥远。实际上，这是用监督来代替裁军并且使裁军谈判开倒车的路线。
    佐林指出，正是苏联的方案才具有实现联合国大会决议的一切必要因素，它规定完全消毁一切进行战争的物质手段。
    苏联方案的出发点是：全面彻底裁军的全部措施必须在有效的国际监督之下实现，同时，监督的范围和性质在任何情况下都必须符合裁军措施的范围和性质，以防止没有裁军的监督，或没有监督的裁军。
    苏联代表团愿意考虑对苏联方案提出的一切修改和补充，并表示同意把普遍裁减核军备的措施放到裁军计划的第一阶段。
    西方国家回避详细地讨论苏联的方案、拒绝着手拟订全面彻底裁军条约，并且提出了自己的所谓“全面和广泛裁军计划”。
    佐林说，西方的计划表明了西方国家企图逃避真正的裁军，阉割裁军计划的实质，把全部事情都缩小为监督问题。这个计划是同联合国大会关于全面彻底裁军的决议背道而驰的。
    佐林指出，西方代表团企图用自己的以监督代替裁军的计划来反对苏联的全面彻底裁军的计划，这就给委员会的工作造成了严重的困难。即使如此，为了使谈判能取得进展，社会主义国家代表团仍然建议，作为制定全面彻底裁军计划的第一个步骤，首先就这种裁军的基本原则取得协议，并在4月8日提出了相应的建议。
    但是，西方国家仍然坚持自己的消极路线，并匆忙地发表声明表示反对，甚至拒绝讨论全面彻底裁军的基本原则。佐林指出，西方国家想以它们的所谓“全面和广泛裁军计划”来在世界舆论面前掩盖它们不愿意执行联合国大会关于全面彻底裁军决议的真相。佐林警告说，西方的这条路是行不通的。全面彻底裁军不是句空话。全人类都关心全面彻底裁军的顺利实现。
    佐林最后说：在休会后我们将恢复我们的谈判。他表示，苏联将继续为使全面彻底裁军的具体计划的谈判取得成就而努力。
    法国代表莫克最后作了简短的发言，他说，他认为，在现有基础上继续进行谈判是无益的。他表示希望，即将举行的政府首脑会议可能为继续谈判制订新的基础。
