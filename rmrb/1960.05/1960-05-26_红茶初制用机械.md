Xinhua News Agency dispatch:

    The Fengqing County of Yunnan Province, the main producing area of "Dian Hong" tea, has vigorously carried out technological innovation, enabling the preliminary processing of black tea to utilize mechanical equipment.
    The county has now produced a large number of indigenous mechanical devices such as hydraulic tea kneading machines, drying machines, and lump breaking and sieving machines. All preliminary processing work has been converted to hydraulic power, eliminating manual tea making. Seven preliminary processing factories, including Xiangtang, Jiashan, and Pingcun, have also installed water turbines and generators, achieving semi-mechanization.
    Using mechanical equipment to make black tea increases work efficiency by more than four times compared to manual tea making. At the same time, it improves tea quality by one to two grades.

    红茶初制用机械
    “滇红”茶主要产区云南省凤庆县，大搞技术革新使红茶初制工作用上了机械。
    现在全县已造出大批水力揉茶机、烘干机、解块分筛机等土机械，全部初制工作都改用水力带动，消灭了手工制茶。象塘、夹山、平村等七个初制厂，还安装了水轮机和发电机，实现了半机械化。
    用机械制红茶，比手工制茶提高工效四倍多。同时提高茶叶品质一至两个等级。
