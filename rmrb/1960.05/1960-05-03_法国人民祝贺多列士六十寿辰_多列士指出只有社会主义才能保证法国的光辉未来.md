Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 28th. A mass rally celebrating the sixtieth birthday of Maurice Thorez, General Secretary of the French Communist Party, was held at the Palais des Sports here on the evening of the 27th.

Thousands of French working people packed the hall of the Palais des Sports, warmly congratulating Thorez and, through Thorez, congratulating the glorious French Communist Party, which has consistently fought for peace, social progress, and socialism.

Many prominent activists of the French Communist Party spoke at the meeting about Thorez's life and work.

French Communist Party Political Bureau member Duclos, who was unable to attend the meeting due to illness, pointed out in a written statement that "Maurice Thorez played a decisive role in the formation of our party's ideology and in the transition of our party into a new type of party that is forever faithful to the principles of Marxism-Leninism."

The conference announced that the Central Committee of the French Communist Party and Thorez had received congratulatory messages from forty-eight fraternal parties, including the Chinese Communist Party, on Thorez's sixtieth birthday.

In his speech, Thorez thanked the people for their congratulations and emphasized: "The Party has made my whole life meaningful, and the Party will always be my whole life."

Speaking of the tasks of the French Communist Party, Thorez emphasized: "The most important task of our Party has always been to integrate the principle of proletarian internationalism with the struggle to love the motherland and the people - the struggle to eliminate the capitalist exploiters who plunder France, oppress France and cause France to go bankrupt and decline, and to build a free, strong and happy France."

Thorez said that only socialism can guarantee a bright future for France and the young generation of France, a future of happiness, peace, and the brilliant development of all human talents. However, this happiness and this peace must be won through a long and unremitting struggle.

Thorez went on to say that at present, we must further develop the struggle to achieve peace in Algeria. We must fight for peace, for the relaxation of the international situation, against the prolongation of the Cold War, for the realization of complete and thorough disarmament under supervision, for the destruction of weapons, especially the highly destructive nuclear weapons.

Thorez finally emphasized: The great superiority of the socialist system is now unprecedentedly recognized internationally. This is the case all over the world, including Asia, Africa, the Americas, and in France, where our party has become an indisputable political force that even its worst enemies recognize. He said that despite all the difficulties and obstacles, the future belongs to the Communists.

    法国人民祝贺多列士六十寿辰
    多列士指出只有社会主义才能保证法国的光辉未来
    据新华社巴黎28日电　27日晚上此间体育宫举行了庆祝法国共产党总书记莫里斯·多列士六十寿辰的群众大会。
    数千名法国劳动人民挤满了体育宫的大厅，热烈地向多列士表示祝贺，并通过多列士对始终不渝地为争取和平、争取社会进步、争取社会主义而斗争的光荣的法国共产党表示祝贺。
    法国共产党的许多著名的活动家在会上讲述了多列士一生的活动。
    因病不能出席大会的法国共产党政治局委员杜克洛在书面讲话中指出，“在我们党的意识形态的形成方面，在我们党过渡成为一个新型的、永远忠实于马克思列宁主义各项原则的政党方面，莫里斯·多列士起了一分决定性的作用。”
    大会宣布，法国共产党中央委员会和多列士已收到四十八个兄弟党、包括中国共产党祝贺多列士六十寿辰的贺电。
    多列士在发言时感谢人们对他的祝贺，并且强调说：“党使得我的整个生活过得有意义，党永远是我的整个生命”。
    在谈到法国共产党的任务时，多列士强调指出：“我们党最重大的任务始终是把无产者的国际主义原则和爱祖国爱人民的战斗——为把掠夺法国、压迫法国并使法国破产衰亡的资本主义剥削者消灭掉，和建立起一个自由、强盛和幸福的法国而进行的战斗——水乳交融地结合在一起。”
    多列士说，只有社会主义才能够保证法国以及法国青年一代得到一个光辉的未来，一个幸福、和平以及人的一切才能能够灿烂地发挥的未来。然而，这种幸福，这种和平，必须通过长期不懈的斗争才能赢得。
    多列士接着说，在目前，我们必须进一步开展争取实现阿尔及利亚和平的斗争。必须为争取和平，争取国际局势缓和，反对拖延冷战、争取实现有监督的全面彻底裁军、争取销毁武器、首先是杀伤力巨大的核武器等任务而斗争。
    多列士最后强调指出：社会主义制度的强大优越性现在在国际上已经空前地得到承认。在全世界，包括亚洲、非洲、美洲以及在我们党已经成为一个无可争论的、甚至它的最坏的敌人也确认的政治力量的法国，情况都是如此。他说，尽管还会有各种困难和障碍，未来是属于共产党人的。
