    Windmill-Type Wooden Sailboat
    Can Sail Freely Both With and Against the Wind
    On the Yangtze River, a windmill-type wooden sailboat has recently appeared. With only one person at the helm, it can sail freely regardless of whether the wind is favorable or adverse. The emergence of this new type of sailboat has overcome the difficulty of "difficulty sailing against the wind" that wooden sailboats have faced for thousands of years, and the hard-working trackers are no longer seen.
    This is a major achievement made by the boatmen of Anhui Province in the technical innovation movement. This creation has been widely promoted in the Wuhu Special District, with 3,200 modified windmill-type wooden sailboats already in the district.
    This windmill-type wooden sailboat was created collectively by the staff of the Hanshan County Navigation Management Station. According to trials, a wooden sailboat with a load of five tons, equipped with this device, can reach a speed of seven li per hour in a three-level headwind and head current. The transport capacity is increased by about three times per ton-kilometer.

    风车式木帆船
    顺风逆风都能行驶自如
    长江江面上，最近出现了一种风车式木帆船，船上只要一个人掌舵，不管顺风或逆风，都能行驶自如。这种新式帆船的出现，使千百年来木帆船“顶风难开船”的困难克服了，辛劳的拉纤工也看不到了。
    这是安徽省船工们在技术革新运动中获得的一项重大成就。这项创造已经在芜湖专区普遍推广，全区改制的风车式木帆船已达三千二百只。
    这种风车式木帆船是由含山县航运管理站职工集体创造的。据试用，一只载重五吨的木帆船，安上这个装置，在三级逆风、逆水情况下，时速能达七华里，按吨公里计，运输能力提高三倍左右。
