Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, May 26th. One and a half million people in the cities of Wuxi, Xuzhou, Suzhou, Nantong, Xin Hailian, Changzhou, Zhenjiang and Yangzhou in Jiangsu Province have recently held demonstrations and rallies, supporting the Soviet Union's just stand against U.S. imperialist aggression and strongly condemning the U.S. imperialist crime of sabotaging the Four-Power Summit Conference.

At the central venues of the rallies in each city, the First Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee spoke at the meeting, representing the people of each city in unanimously expressing their firm support for the Soviet Union's just stand against U.S. imperialist aggression, and their determination to stand with the Soviet people to fight to the end to defend world peace. He Binghao, First Secretary of the Wuxi Municipal Party Committee, pointed out in his speech that U.S. imperialism's aggression and provocations against the Soviet Union are aggression and provocations against China and the entire socialist camp. The people of Wuxi stand completely with the Soviet people and are determined to fight to the end against the enemy of world peace – U.S. imperialism. Yu Qian, Secretary of the Nantong Prefectural Party Committee and First Secretary of the Nantong Municipal Party Committee, sternly warned U.S. imperialism at the mass rally held in Nantong: If anyone dares to provoke a socialist country, they will inevitably be met with a devastating counterattack. Leaders of various democratic parties and people's organizations, as well as representatives of workers and peasants, also spoke at the meeting.

The masses participating in the rallies and demonstrations in these cities were extremely angry about the U.S. imperialist aggression and provocations and its crime of sabotaging the Four-Power Summit Conference. Han Shiming, a national model worker from Xuzhou, said: From U.S. imperialism's consistent acts of aggression and war provocations, we fully realize that U.S. imperialism is the number one enemy of world peace, and we are determined to fight resolutely against U.S. imperialist aggression and war provocations and to defend world peace. Zhang Baifang, a veteran technician from the Yangzhou Prefectural Electricity Bureau, had his house destroyed, his young son and daughter killed, and his daughter-in-law and wife injured by planes supplied by U.S. imperialism to the Kuomintang reactionaries in 1949. He said angrily: "U.S. imperialism is worse than wolves." Yang Yucai, a first-class combat hero of the Volunteer Army and a hero of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea who participated in the battle to eliminate the White Tiger Regiment headquarters of the Li Chengwan "Capital" Division in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, said: "If U.S. imperialism forgets the lessons of the aggression against Korea and dares to launch a war, it will suffer an even greater defeat than it did during the aggression against Korea."

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 26th. In recent days, the Soviet working people have continued to express their anger at the aggressive and provocative actions of U.S. imperialism and demand that the United Nations Security Council resolutely condemn this provocative behavior by the United States by writing letters to newspapers or holding discussions.

Many readers of "Pravda" recently wrote to the newspaper after reading the book "Thoroughly Expose the Aggressors! A Record of U.S. Aircraft Provocatively Violating Soviet Airspace," which was published not long ago. Michurin, an assembler at the Moscow Small Automobile Factory, said in his letter that reading this book gave rise to two emotions: one was boundless anger at the gangster-like violation of Soviet airspace by U.S. spy planes, and the other was lofty pride in the Soviet armed forces, which are capable of stopping any aggressive conspiracy. Michurin said that the unprecedentedly shameless statements by Herter and Eisenhower collected in the book aroused the greatest indignation of all honest people in the world. He said that all of us Soviet people unanimously and warmly endorse Khrushchev's statement. The summit conference was sabotaged by the U.S. reactionary groups, and those who announced the gangster policy against the Soviet Union should be held responsible for this.

After reading the book, Fomina, a textile worker at the Moscow "Three Mountains" Textile Factory, wrote to "Pravda" saying, "All the workers of the 'Three Mountains' Textile Factory unanimously declare: 'We will never allow U.S. aerial gangsters to flaunt their power, and we will never allow them to fly over our peaceful country!'" Fomina said that the fact that U.S. state activists have declared espionage to be their national policy has aroused our immense anger.

In the various workshops of the Moscow "Goznak" printing plant, the workers immediately held discussions on the 24th during their lunch break after reading in the newspaper that the United Nations Security Council would be meeting at the request of the Soviet Union. Borisov, the captain of the "Communist Labor Team," said that Comrade Khrushchev's statement in Paris on the 16th expressed the common opinion of all the Soviet people, and we will never allow aggressors to freely invade our airspace. The Soviet government's move to demand that the Security Council discuss the unprecedented act of aggression against our country by the U.S. ruling circles is completely correct. Tsubukova, a waste product inspector, said that we women warmly endorse the Soviet government's Leninist policy of peaceful diplomacy. We hope that the United Nations Security Council will resolutely condemn the provocative actions of the U.S. imperialists and take all measures to prevent similar gangster behavior from happening again in the future. Bakharev, the foreman of the printing workshop, said that the shameless actions of the Pentagon warmongers and the shameless statements of some U.S. state activists have aroused our great indignation, and all the Soviet people have the right to demand that the Security Council condemn the rampant defenders of the "Cold War," which is also the demand of honest people all over the world.

    彻底粉碎美国的侵略阴谋
    江苏省一百五十万城乡人民举行大示威
    苏联人民要求安理会谴责美国挑衅行为
    新华社南京26日电　江苏省无锡、徐州、苏州、南通、新海连、常州、镇江、扬州八个市最近有一百五十万人举行示威游行和集会，支持苏联反对美帝国主义侵略的正义立场，严厉谴责美帝国主义破坏四国首脑会议罪行。
    在各市集会的中心会场上，中共市委第一书记都在会上讲了话，他们分别代表各市人民一致表示坚决支持苏联反对美帝国主义侵略的正义立场，坚决和苏联人民站在一起为保卫世界和平而斗争到底。中共无锡市委第一书记何冰皓在会上讲话指出，美帝国主义对苏联的侵略和挑衅，就是对中国和整个社会主义阵营的侵略和挑衅。无锡市人民完全和苏联人民站在一起，坚决为反对世界和平的敌人——美帝国主义而斗争到底。中共南通地委书记、南通市委第一书记郁谦，在南通市举行的群众大会上严正警告美帝国主义：如果谁敢于向社会主义国家挑衅，就一定要遭到毁灭性的还击。各民主党派、人民团体的负责人，和工人、农民的代表也在会上讲了话。
    参加这些城市集会和示威的群众，对美帝国主义的侵略和挑衅行为及其破坏四国首脑会议的罪行都极为愤怒。徐州市的全国工业劳动模范韩士铭说：我们从美帝国主义一贯进行侵略和战争挑衅的行为中，充分认识到美帝国主义是世界和平的第一号敌人，我们决心为反对美帝国主义的侵略和战争挑衅、为保卫世界和平而坚决斗争。扬州专署电业局老技师张柏芳，1949年曾被美帝国主义供给国民党反动派的飞机炸毁了房子，炸死了年幼的儿子和女儿，炸伤了媳妇、妻子。他愤怒地说：“美帝国主义比豺狼还不如。”曾经在抗美援朝战争中参加消灭李承晚“首都”师白虎团团部战斗的志愿军一级战斗英雄、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国英雄杨育才说：“如果美帝国主义忘记了侵略朝鲜的教训，敢于发动战争，它就会遭到比侵略朝鲜时更大的失败。
    新华社莫斯科26日电　苏联劳动人民几天来还在继续通过向报纸写信或举行座谈等方式，表达自己对美帝国主义侵略挑衅行动的愤怒，并要求联合国安全理事会坚决谴责美国的这种挑衅行为。
      “真理报”的许多读者最近在读了不久前出版的“彻底揭露侵略者！美国飞机挑衅性侵犯苏联领空记实”一书后，纷纷给报社写信。莫斯科小型汽车制造厂装配工米楚林在信中说，在读这本书时令人产生两种感情，一种是被美国间谍飞机强盗似地侵犯苏联领空的行为所引起的无比愤怒，另一种是为能够制止任何侵略阴谋的苏联武装力量感到崇高的自豪。米楚林说，这本书中所收集的赫脱和艾森豪威尔的空前无耻的声明，引起了世界上所有正直人们的最大愤慨。他说，我们全体苏联人一致热烈赞同赫鲁晓夫的声明。政府首脑会议是美国反动集团破坏的，那些宣布对苏联实行强盗政策的人对此应承担责任。
    莫斯科“三山”纺织厂纺织工弗米娜看了这本书后给“真理报”写信说，“三山”纺织厂全体职工一致声明：“决不允许美国空中强盗耀武扬威，决不允许他们在我们和平国家的上空飞行！”弗米娜说，美国国家活动家竟把间谍活动宣布成为自己的国家政策，这引起了我们无比的愤怒。
    在莫斯科“戈兹纳克”印刷厂的各个车间里，职工们24日在午间休息时从报纸上读到联合国安全理事会应苏联的要求开会的消息后，立即举行了座谈。“共产主义劳动队”队长波里索夫说，赫鲁晓夫同志16日在巴黎的声明表达了全体苏联人民的共同意见，我们决不允许侵略者逍遥自在地侵入我国领空。苏联政府要求安全理事会讨论美国统治集团对我国进行的罕见的侵略行为的作法，是完全正确的。废品检查员楚布科娃说，我们妇女热烈赞同苏联政府的列宁和平外交政策。我们希望联合国安全理事会坚决谴责美帝国主义者的挑衅行动，并采取一切措施，使类似的强盗行为今后不再发生。印刷车间的工长巴哈列夫说，五角大楼黩武主义者的无耻行动和美国某些国家活动家的无耻声明，引起了我们极大的愤慨，全体苏联人民有权要求安全理事会谴责猖狂的“冷战”捍卫者，而这也是全世界正直的人们的要求。
