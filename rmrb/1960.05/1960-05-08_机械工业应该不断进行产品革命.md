    The Chongqing Machine Tool Plant’s timely absorption of innovative experiences and suggestions from various user units during the technical innovation and technical revolution movement to reform the design of hobbing machines is a highly significant new event. It raises a series of new questions for us: In the mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution, how should the machinery industry treat product revolution? In what direction should product revolution develop? And what methods should be used to carry out product revolution?
    The purpose of technical innovation and technical revolution is to transform manual operations in all walks of life into mechanized and semi-mechanized production. For enterprises that already use machinery, the goal is to continue to improve the degree of mechanization and implement automated and semi-automated production in order to increase labor productivity. In the process of transforming manual operations into mechanized and semi-mechanized production, many enterprise employees have imitated or innovated existing mechanical equipment in similar enterprises, while some have created brand-new mechanical equipment. Workers and masses in various industries that already use mechanical production have made many significant reforms to the mechanical equipment they use. The reformed mechanical equipment has either increased the degree of mechanization and automation to better suit the requirements of organizing automated and linked production lines; or simplified the structure and reduced the weight; or changed the performance to better adapt to the requirements of multi-variety production; or improved the process and increased production efficiency, improving working conditions. In short, the reformed mechanical equipment is more advanced and more perfect than in the past. Compared with these innovated new mechanical equipment, some of the same type of products that are now being mass-produced or trial-produced in some factories have a sense of being outdated and have already become objects of technical revolution. The mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution promotes product revolution and the development of science and technology, which is an excellent and important thing. The machinery manufacturing sector must promptly grasp the situation of inventions and creations in all walks of life, innovate product designs, and meet the needs of users. If we turn a deaf ear to the inventions and creations of the masses and continue to produce outdated products, then the user units will have to modify these products before they can be used in production, which is a huge waste of human, material, and financial resources. This is not and should not be allowed for socialist enterprises. The workers put it well: "We cannot manufacture objects of technical revolution. To revolutionize, we must revolutionize ourselves first." There is no end to technological progress. There is only relative new technology, not absolute new technology. Today's new technology will inevitably become old technology after some time and will be replaced by newer technology. Any product will eventually be reformed and become the object of technical revolution. This is how people continuously develop science and technology. Therefore, we should not rest content with producing outdated products, but should treat product design with a spirit of continuous revolution. Especially in the current movement of technical innovation and technical revolution, we should of course continue to produce those old products that have not yet been reformed but are needed by the state, without waiting for new technology; but for those products that have been reformed, we should concentrate the inventions and creations of all walks of life and launch a high tide of product revolution to manufacture more advanced equipment for the country, and no longer produce outdated old products. "Cannot manufacture objects of technical revolution. To revolutionize, we must revolutionize ourselves first." This embodies the firm will of the working class for continuous revolution.
    The innovation of each part or component of mechanical equipment is only a quantitative change for the entire equipment and not a qualitative change, but for the reformed part, it is not only a quantitative change but also a qualitative leap. That is to say, quantitative change contains partial qualitative change. When the quantitative change develops to a certain degree, that is, when the partial qualitative change develops to a certain degree, the transformation of the entire equipment develops from quantitative change to a qualitative leap. The transformation of a machine is like this, and so is the transformation of a section, a workshop, a factory, a department, and even the entire national economy's production technology. People say that the current technical innovation and technical revolution is not "changing with each passing day" but "changing with each passing night." This means that in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, production technology is in a state of quantitative change and partial qualitative change day and night. In this movement, timely reforming product designs based on the inventions and creations of all walks of life is actually concentrating the advanced technical experiences created by the dispersed masses, analyzing, comparing, testing, finalizing, and improving them, and transforming them into systematic advanced technical experiences. Through the mass production of new products, the advanced technical experiences created by a few enterprises are promoted to the entire industry. In this way, product revolution plays the role of summarizing, improving, and promoting advanced technical experiences. The mass technical innovation and technical revolution movement promotes the product revolution of the machinery industry, and the product revolution of the machinery industry in turn promotes the development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. In this way, the cycle continues, spiraling upwards, and the technical level of the entire national economy will be rapidly improved. Some of the outdated and unreasonable structures of mechanical products left over from history may be quickly improved, and a whole set of new products adapted to China's specific conditions and with China's original style will be rapidly established, and on this basis, China's high-end, large-scale, precision, and advanced new products will be rapidly developed. Therefore, the product revolution of the machinery industry is by no means a simple problem of changing products in machinery manufacturing enterprises, but a major issue related to consolidating the achievements of technical revolution in all walks of life and accelerating the process of technical revolution in the entire national economy. The machinery industry should complete product revolution as an important task of technical revolution.
    With the in-depth development of technical revolution, the production of mechanical equipment must further adapt to the requirements of mechanized and automated production development. Therefore, simplifying unreasonable structures, reducing weight; improving and simplifying processes; increasing the degree of standardization, generalization, and serialization of parts, components, and products; and improving the degree of mechanization and automation of equipment, while paying attention to developing mechanized and automated equipment adapted to multi-variety production and comprehensive utilization; and vigorously developing simple and efficient equipment should become the main direction of product revolution. Here, a kind of erroneous view must be broken, that is, the belief that the more complex the structure of mechanical products, the larger the volume, the heavier the weight, the more expensive the materials, and the more difficult the products are to master, the more advanced they are; conversely, the more basic and backward they are. People who hold this view often look down on the inventions and creations of the masses and on indigenous methods. But the facts negate this view. Under the condition of guaranteeing the same performance and the same production efficiency, it is not the more complex the structure, the larger the volume, the heavier the weight, the more expensive the materials, and the more difficult it is to master, the more advanced it is, but just the opposite. A simple building-block-type combined machine tool created by the employees of Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory that can process seventeen processes is obviously superior and more advanced than an automated production line composed of seventeen machine tools. Under one condition, the development of mechanical equipment from simple to complex, from small to large, is progress; while under another condition, the development from complex to simple, from large to small, is also a trend of development and a technical revolution. We must recognize these two different development trends so as not to blindly pursue foreign complex things and reject indigenous simple things, and to correctly implement the policy of combining foreign and indigenous methods, using foreign methods when possible, and using indigenous methods when possible.
    Adopting the "three-in-one" method of reforming product design, that is, combining users, manufacturers, and designers to work together, is also a good method worth learning. Users deal with equipment every day and are most familiar with the performance and their advantages and disadvantages; based on their accumulated experience and the requirements of production development, they have continuously made many beneficial reforms and developments to the equipment; their opinions on product revolution have mostly been tested in practice and are the most reliable and valuable. Manufacturers, from long-term production practice, know best which products and parts are easy to manufacture and which are not; they are the best appraiser of the manufacturability of products and are also a positive force in improving product technology. Designers generally have more theoretical knowledge, and they have also accumulated a lot of valuable experience in long-term design work. The "three-in-one" method of users, manufacturers, and designers is a method of the mass line, and it is also a method of combining practice and theory, that is, coming from practice, rising to theory, and then going to practice. Therefore, this method is also a method of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results. The practice of Chongqing Machine Tool Plant proves that by using the "three-in-one" method of users, manufacturers, and designers, more advanced mechanical equipment that is more suitable for China's specific conditions can be designed.
    The vigorous development of the mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution centered on "four modernizations" has created an excellent situation and extremely favorable conditions for the great revolution of mechanical products. Machinery manufacturing enterprises should seize the current favorable opportunity and launch a high tide of great product revolution, and incorporate the achievements of technical revolution in all walks of life into product design. The National Technical Innovation and Technical Revolution On-Site Conference held in Chongqing at the end of March and the beginning of April once raised this issue. We believe that the employees of machinery manufacturing enterprises will definitely make outstanding achievements.

    机械工业应该不断进行产品革命
    重庆机床厂在技术革新、技术革命运动中，及时吸收各个使用单位的革新经验和建议，改革滚齿机的设计，是一个极有意义的新事件。它给我们提出了一系列的新问题：在技术革新和技术革命全民运动中，机械工业部门应该怎样对待产品革命？产品革命朝着什么方向发展？以及用什么方法进行产品革命？
    技术革新、技术革命的目的，是把各行各业的手工操作变为机械化、半机械化生产，对于已经使用机械的企业，则是继续提高机械化程度，实行自动化、半自动化生产，以便提高劳动生产效率。在变手工操作为机械化、半机械化生产的过程中，不少企业的职工仿制或者革新同类企业原有的机械设备，有些则创造了崭新的机械设备。在原来已经使用机械生产的各行各业的职工群众，对自己所使用的机械设备都做了很多很大的改革。经过改革的机械设备，或者提高了机械化、自动化程度，使之更能适合组织自动化、联动化生产线的要求；或者简化了结构，减轻了重量；或者改变了性能，使之更能适应多品种生产的要求；或者改进了工艺过程，提高了生产效率，改善了劳动条件。总之，改革以后的机械设备，比过去是更先进、更完善了。现在有些工厂正在大量生产或者试制生产的同类型产品，跟这些革新后的新的机械设备比较起来，大有明日黄花之感，已经变成技术革命的对象了。技术革新、技术革命的群众运动，推动产品革命，推动科学技术发展，这是极好的大事情。机械制造部门必须及时掌握各行各业创造发明的情况，革新产品设计，满足用户需要。如果对群众的创造发明不闻不问，继续生产已经过时的产品，那么，使用单位拿到了这些产品，还得进行一番改造才用于生产，这是人力、物力、财力的莫大浪费。对社会主义企业来说，这是不应该，也是不允许的。工人们说得好：“我们不能制造技术革命对象。要革命，我们自己先革。”技术的进步是没有止境的。世界上只有相对的新技术，没有绝对的新技术。现在的新技术，过一些时候一定会变为旧技术，一定会被更新的技术所代替。任何一种产品，总有一天被改革，成为技术革命的对象。人们就是这样不断地发展着科学技术。因此，我们就不应心安理得地生产过了时的产品，而要以不断革命的精神来对待产品设计。特别是在当前的技术革新、技术革命运动中，对那些还没有被改革、国家又需要的旧产品，当然应当继续生产，不要等待新技术；而对那些已被改革的产品，则要集中各行各业的创造发明，掀起一个产品革命的高潮，为国家制造更先进的设备，不要再生产过时的旧产品。“不能制造技术革命对象。要革命，我们自己先革。”这正体现了工人阶级不断革命的坚强意志。
    机械设备的每一个零件或部件的革新，对于整个设备来说，只是量的变化，还不是质的变化，但是对被改革的那一个局部来说，不但是量的变化，也是质的飞跃。也就是说，在量变中包含着部分的质变。量变发展到一定程度，即局部的质变发展到一定程度的时候，整个设备的变革，就从量变发展到质的飞跃。一台机器的变革是这样，一个工段、一个车间、一个工厂、一个部门，以至整个国民经济的生产技术的变革也是这样。人们说，现在的技术革新、技术革命不是“日新月异”而是“日新夜异”。意思是说，在技术革新、技术革命运动中，生产技术日日夜夜都处在量变和部分质变的发展中。在这个运动中，及时地根据各行各业的创造发明，改革产品设计，实际上是把分散的群众创造的先进技术经验集中起来，加以分析比较、试验、定型和提高，变为系统的先进技术经验，并通过新产品的成批生产，把少数企业创造的先进技术经验向全行业推广。这样，产品革命就起到了总结、提高和推广先进技术经验的作用。全民的技术革新、技术革命运动，促进了机械工业的产品革命，机械工业的产品革命又反过来推动技术革新、技术革命运动的发展。如此循环不已，螺旋式上升，整个国民经济的技术水平就会得到迅速的提高；历史上遗留下来的机械产品的某些过时的、不合理的结构，就有可能迅速得到改进，一整套适应我国具体条件的、具有我国独创风格的新产品将会迅速地建立起来，并且将在这个基础上，迅速发展我国高、大、精、尖新产品。因此，机械工业的产品革命，决不是机械制造企业简单的改换产品问题，而是关系到巩固各行各业技术革命成果，加速整个国民经济技术革命进程的大问题。机械工业应当把产品革命当做技术革命的一个重要课题来完成。
    技术革命深入发展，机械设备的生产，必须进一步适应机械化、自动化生产发展的要求。因此，简化不合理的结构，减轻重量；改进和简化工艺过程；提高零件、部件和产品的标准化、通用化、系列化的程度；提高设备的机械化、自动化程度，同时注意发展适应多品种生产和综合利用的机械化、自动化设备；大力发展简易的、高效率的设备应当成为产品革命的主要方向。在这里，有一种错误看法必须打破，这就是认为机械产品的结构越复杂、体积越大、重量越重、用料越贵重和越难掌握的产品就越高级，越先进；反之，就越低级，越落后。抱有这种看法的人，往往看不起群众的发明创造，看不起土办法。事实却否定了这种看法。在保证同样性能和同样生产效率的条件下，并不是结构越复杂、体积越大、重量越重、用料越贵重、越难掌握的，就越高级、越先进，而是恰恰相反。重庆建设机床厂职工创造的一台能加工十七道工序的简易积木式组合机床，显然要比十七台机床组成的自动生产线更优越，更高级。在一种条件下，机械设备由简单到复杂、由小到大，是进步；而在另一种条件下，由复杂到简单、由大到小，也是发展的趋势和技术上的革命。我们必须认识这两种不同的发展趋势，才不致于盲目地追求洋的复杂的东西，排斥土的简易的东西，才能正确地贯彻执行洋土并举，能洋则洋，能土则土的方针。
    改革产品设计采取三结合的方法，即使用者、制造者、设计者三方面结合一起，协同动作，也是值得学习的好方法。使用者天天跟设备打交道，最熟悉设备的性能和它们的优缺点；他们根据自己日积月累的经验和生产发展的要求，不断地对设备进行了许多有益的改革和发展；他们对产品革命提供的意见，大都经过了实践的检验，是最可靠、最宝贵的。制造者从长期的生产实践中，最清楚哪些产品和零件容易制造，哪些不易制造；他们是产品工艺性好坏的最好鉴定者，也是改进产品工艺的积极力量。设计者一般具有较多的理论知识，他们在长期设计工作中，也积累了很多宝贵的经验。使用者、制造者、设计者三结合的方法，是群众路线的方法，也是实践和理论相结合的方法，即从实践中来，上升为理论，再到实践中去的方法。所以，这个方法也是多快好省的方法。重庆机床厂的实践证明，运用使用者、制造者、设计者三结合的方法，就可以设计出更先进、更适合中国具体情况的机械设备来。
    以“四化”为中心的技术革新、技术革命全民运动的蓬勃发展，给机械产品大革命造就了大好的形势和极有利的条件。机械制造企业应当抓住当前有利时机，掀起一个产品大革命的高潮，把各行各业的技术革命成果纳入产品设计。3月底4月初在重庆召开的全国技术革新、技术革命现场会议，曾经提出这个问题。我们相信，机械制造企业的职工，一定会做出出色的成绩来。
