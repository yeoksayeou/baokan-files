Xinhua News Agency, 14th. Bash-Taqi, the organization secretary of the People's National Party of Sierra Leone, West Africa, who is currently visiting China, announced in Beijing today that the people of Sierra Leone are determined and confident to resolutely fight against imperialism and colonialism until they achieve true national independence and democracy.

In an exclusive interview with our reporter, Bash-Taqi spoke about the recent Sierra Leone Constitutional Conference held in London with the participation of the British authorities. The conference reached an agreement that Britain would grant Sierra Leone "independence" on April 27, 1961, but Britain would still retain privileges in Sierra Leone. The conference also stipulated that the country must sign a military treaty with Britain after "independence." Bash-Taqi said: "This conference is a deceptive trick. It is for the benefit of British colonialists, not for the benefit of the people of Sierra Leone. We must never form such an alliance with British imperialism. Britain wants to turn Sierra Leone into a capitalist country that continues to provide it with raw materials. We will never agree."

He said that he fully agreed with the attitude of Shaq Stevens, the deputy chairman of the People's National Party and a member of the Sierra Leone delegation, who refused to sign the London agreement.

Bash-Taqi also severely condemned U.S. imperialism for colluding with British imperialism to cruelly exploit the people of Sierra Leone. He said that U.S. imperialist investment accounts for 25% of the entire national economy of Sierra Leone. He also exposed the deceptive methods used by U.S. imperialism in an attempt to disguise itself as a "protector" of the interests of the people of Sierra Leone. He said: "We will never be fooled by U.S. imperialism."

Bash-Taqi is the first guest from Sierra Leone to visit China. He said excitedly: "This visit has left a deep impression on me! The visits in various parts of China have greatly encouraged me. The example of China shows that once the people are liberated, there is nothing they cannot do. The Chinese people are hardworking, and they have made great contributions to world peace. Here people are equal. I deeply believe that China will never exploit the people of other countries. Only such a country can carry out construction at such a high speed."

    巴什·达吉在北京发表谈话
    塞拉勒窝内人民有决心争取民族独立
    美英两国在塞拉勒窝内相互勾结进行残酷剥削
    新华社14日讯　正在我国访问的西非塞拉勒窝内人民民族党组织书记巴什·达吉今天在北京宣布：塞拉勒窝内人民有坚强的决心和充分的信心与帝国主义和殖民主义坚决斗争，直到获得真正的民族独立和民主。
    巴什·达吉在单独接见本社记者时，谈到了最近在伦敦召开的有英国当局参加的塞拉勒窝内制宪会议。会议达成协议决定，英国在1961年4月27日给予塞拉勒窝内以“独立”，但英国仍将在塞拉勒窝内保有特权。会议还规定，这个国家在“独立”后必须同英国签订军事条约。巴什·达吉说：“这个会议是骗人的把戏。它是为了英国殖民主义者的利益，而不是为了塞拉勒窝内人民的利益。我们决不能同英帝国主义结成这样的联盟。英国想把塞拉勒窝内变成继续为它提供原料的资本主义国家，我们决不同意。”
    他说，他完全赞成塞拉勒窝内代表团团员、人民民族党副主席沙克·斯蒂文斯拒绝在伦敦协议上签字的态度。
    巴什·达吉还严厉地谴责了美帝国主义勾结英帝国主义，对塞拉勒窝内人民进行残酷的剥削。他说，美帝国主义的投资占塞拉勒窝内整个国民经济的25％。他还揭露美帝国主义用种种欺骗手法，企图把自己打扮成塞拉勒窝内人民的利益的“保护者”。他说：“我们决不会上美帝国主义的当”。
  巴什·达吉是塞拉勒窝内第一个来到我国访问的客人。他兴奋地说：“这次访问给我的印象太深了！在中国各地的参观访问使我得到很大的鼓舞。中国的例子说明了：人民一旦得到解放，就没有什么办不到的事情。中国人民是勤奋的，他们对世界和平作出了很大的贡献。在这里人们是平等的。我深深地相信，中国根本不会去剥削他国人民。只有这样的国家，才能这样高速度地进行建设。”
