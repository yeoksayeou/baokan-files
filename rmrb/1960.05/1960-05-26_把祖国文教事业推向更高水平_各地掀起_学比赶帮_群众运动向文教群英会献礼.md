    Xinhua News Agency Report – To welcome the convocation of the National Cultural and Educational Front Heroes Conference, cultural and educational systems across the country have, since February, launched a surging mass movement and gift-offering campaign to learn from the advanced, compare with the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and help the backward.

    Under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, educational workers in various regions, taking the welcoming of the Heroes Conference as a driving force, have greatly boosted their energy, established models, and extensively and deeply carried out a mass movement centered on teaching reform, teaching aid innovation, and improving teaching quality. More than five million teachers and students in universities, middle schools, and primary schools in Hunan Province enthusiastically support teaching reform and strive to comprehensively improve education quality in every possible way, striving to catch up with the national level. All the teachers in Liaoyuan Commune created more than 4,000 teaching aids of various kinds in less than a month. Schools in Shanghai are actively learning from advanced schools in fraternal provinces and cities in carrying out teaching reform. For example, first-grade teachers at Nanshi District Central Primary School are determined to make their teaching achievements surpass those of Beiguan Primary School in Heishan County, Liaoning, and have adopted effective measures to implement large-scale collaboration among all subjects, combining classroom and extracurricular activities, and concentrating efforts on vigorously promoting literacy teaching. They have now achieved a result of recognizing 52 characters per class hour. Teachers and students in various schools have also given full play to their spirit of daring to think and daring to act, and have made considerable achievements in innovating teaching aids. Under the very poor technical and material conditions, the teachers and students of No. 1 Middle School in Changge County, Henan Province, boldly imagined, overcame difficulties, and carried out a teaching aid revolution. In two months, they realized broadcast teaching and electric teaching aids, saving teachers, improving teaching quality, and creating favorable conditions for thoroughly carrying out teaching reform.

    The good news of the convocation of the Cultural and Educational Front Heroes Conference has also greatly promoted amateur education work in various regions. Under the encouragement and promotion of the Heroes Conference, amateur education has blossomed everywhere in Anhui Province. For example, the evergreen civil schools in Anqing Prefecture only numbered more than 140 in early April, but have now grown to more than 800, with an enrollment of 20,000 people. Factories and enterprises in Hefei City are vigorously running amateur universities, which have now increased from the original 13 to 23, and the number of students has increased by 56% compared with March. According to statistics from 52 counties and cities in Shaanxi Province, 4.25 million young and middle-aged people have been completely freed from illiteracy, and 2.5 million of them have been promoted to study in amateur schools. Chifeng City in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region persisted in literacy work during the tense period of preparing for and carrying out spring plowing and production. Fifteen townships in the city completed the task of eliminating illiteracy in March and popularized amateur elementary schools.

    To welcome the Cultural and Educational Heroes Conference, universities and colleges across the country have launched enthusiastic scientific research gift-offering activities, and good news of the schools offering gifts to the conference has been reported one after another. For example, teachers and students from Shandong University, Shandong Normal College, and 16 other universities and colleges, in collaboration with scientific research institutions, have applied linear programming in operations research to industrial and agricultural production and transportation industries. Qufu Normal College alone has helped Jining Prefecture train 3,500 workers and dispatchers. After workers mastered linear programming, the actual carrying capacity of earth-carrying vehicles alone increased from 50% to 75% in the past. Teachers and students of Nanjing Institute of Technology completed 1,998 scientific research projects after more than two months of efforts, and trial-produced 287 new products and 202 cutting-edge products. Under the call of "Make greater achievements and offer gifts to the Heroes Conference," various departments of Gansu Agricultural University completed many major scientific research projects after a month of concentrated effort. For example, the "firewall electric greenhouse incubation" experiment can incubate 24,000 eggs each time, with a hatching rate of 87%, basically realizing the automation and mechanization of the egg incubation process.

    Employees in the health systems in various regions also launched a mass movement centered on technological innovation and eliminating pests and diseases to offer gifts to the conference. According to statistics from only eleven municipal hospitals in Beijing, as of April 23, more than 19,000 innovation projects had been proposed, and more than 8,100 had been completed. Artificial kidneys, artificial heart-lung machines, etc., which used to be imported from foreign countries, have been successfully trial-produced. Health units in Guiyang City pushed the gift-offering movement to a climax through martial arts competitions, competitions between people and people, departments and departments, and visits and studies, and the number of innovation projects increased again and again. According to statistics in March, 21 units had completed 11,070 technological innovation projects, including 636 major innovation projects and 495 scientific research papers. These innovation projects are of great significance for improving medical standards and work efficiency. Under the leadership of the Party committee, the employees of the hospitals in Changchun City, Jilin Province, launched a high tide of technological revolution and scientific research activities to "establish lofty ambitions, make great aspirations, tackle the cutting edge, and climb to the peak." Since the beginning of April, they have proposed 906 projects. Guangnan County in Yunnan Province launched a health model village movement of "learning from the sun (village name) and catching up with the sun, turning every village and stockade into the sun." In late February, there were only 19 "Sun Villages" in the county, but by March 9, they had developed into 63 "Sun Village"-style health model villages.

    The vast number of employees in the cultural, sports, and news systems in various regions have also created excellent results with extremely excited moods and full energy to offer gifts to the National Heroes Conference. (Picture attached)

    把祖国文教事业推向更高水平
    各地掀起“学比赶帮”群众运动向文教群英会献礼
    本报讯　为了迎接全国文教战线群英会的召开，各地文教系统从2月以来，掀起了汹涌澎湃的学先进、比先进、赶先进、帮后进的群众运动和献礼运动。
    各地教育工作者在各级党委的领导下，以迎接群英会为动力，大鼓干劲，大树标兵，广泛深入地开展了以教学改革、教具革新、提高教学质量为中心内容的群众运动。湖南省大、中、小学五百多万师生热烈拥护教学改革，并千方百计全面提高教育质量，力争赶上全国水平。燎原公社全体教师不到一个月时间就创制了各种教具四千余件。上海市各学校在进行教学改革中，积极向兄弟省、市先进学校看齐。如南市区中心小学一年级教师决心要使教学成绩超过辽宁黑山县北关小学，并采取了有效措施，实行各科大协作，课内外结合，集中力量大搞识字教学，现已取得了每课时识五十二个字的成绩。各地学校师生还充分发挥敢想敢干精神，在革新教具方面做出了不小的成绩。河南长葛县一中全体师生在技术条件、物质条件都很差的情况下，仍然大胆设想，克服困难，进行教具革命，在两个月的时间内就实现了播音教学和教具电动，节约了教师，提高了教学质量，为彻底进行教学改革创造了有利的条件。
    召开文教战线群英会的喜讯，对各地业余教育工作也起了很大推动作用。安徽全省在群英会鼓舞推动下，业余教育遍地开花。如安庆专区四季常青的民校，在4月上旬仅有一百四十多所，现在已发展到八百多所，入学人数已达两万人。合肥市区工厂、企业部门大办业余大学，现已由原来的十三所增加到二十三所，入学人数比3月份又增加了56％。据陕西省五十二个县、市的统计，已有四百二十五万青壮年全部脱盲，其中二百五十万人已升入业余学校学习。内蒙古自治区赤峰市，在紧张的备耕、春耕生产中坚持扫盲工作，全市十五个乡在3月份就完成了扫盲任务，并且普及了业余高小。
    各地高等学校为迎接文教群英会，掀起了热烈的科学研究的献礼活动，各校向大会献礼的捷报纷纷传来。如山东大学、山东师范学院等十八所高等学校师生协同科学研究机关，已将运筹学中的线性规划运用到工农业生产和交通运输业等方面。仅曲阜师范学院一校就帮助济宁专区培养了三千五百名工人和调度员。工人们掌握了线性规划后，光是地排车运输一项，实载力就由过去的50％提高到75％。南京工学院的师生经过二个多月的努力，完成的科学研究项目达一千九百九十八项，共试制新产品二百八十七种，尖端产品二百零二种。甘肃省农业大学各系在“做出更大成绩，向群英会献礼”的号召下，经过一个月的突击，完成了许多重大科学研究项目。如“火墙电气温室孵化”的试验，每次可孵卵二万四千枚，孵化率达87％，基本上实现了孵卵过程自动化、机械化。
    各地卫生系统职工也开展了以技术革新、除害灭病为中心向大会献礼的群众运动。北京市仅据十一个市属医院的统计，到4月23日止，就提出革新项目一万九千多项，已完成八千一百多项。过去需从外国进口的人工肾、人工心肺机等，都已试制成功。贵阳市卫生单位通过比武大会，人对人、科对科的竞赛和参观学习，把献礼运动推向高潮，革新项目一增再增。据3月份统计，二十一个单位就已完成技术革新一万一千零七十项，其中重大革新项目六百三十六项，科学研究论文四百九十五篇。这些革新项目对提高医疗水平和工作效率具有重大意义。吉林省长春市医院的职工，在党委领导下掀起了“树雄心、立壮志、攻尖端、攀高峰”的技术革命和科学研究活动高潮。4月初以来，他们提出的项目已达九百零六项。云南省广南县掀起了一个“学太阳（村名）赶太阳，村村寨寨变太阳”的卫生模范村运动。全县2月下旬仅有十九个“太阳村”，到3月9日已发展到六十三个“太阳村”式的卫生模范村。
    各地文化、体育、新闻系统的广大职工，也都以极其兴奋的心情和十足的干劲，创造出优异的成绩，向全国群英会献礼。（附图片）
