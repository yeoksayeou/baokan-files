Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, May 14th: Liu Lianren, who was abducted by Japanese imperialism and forced to live an inhuman life in the desolate mountains of Hokkaido, Japan for thirteen years, spoke to a Xinhua News Agency reporter in Jinan. He expressed his resolute opposition to the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and his firm support for the patriotic and just struggle of the Japanese people.

Liu Lianren is now the director of the Bacterial Fertilizer Factory of the Jinggou People's Commune in Gaomi County. He told the reporter indignantly: "When I saw the news in the newspaper that the United States and Japan had signed a military alliance treaty and were plotting a new war of aggression, I was extremely angry!"

Liu Lianren said: "I want to accuse Japanese imperialism of its crimes to the people of the world. In the autumn of 1944, I was abducted by Japanese bandits from my hometown of Gaomi County, Shandong Province, to Hokkaido, Japan. There, I was forced to work as a laborer in the mines, working like a beast of burden all day long. The Japanese fascists often whipped us. Later, I could no longer bear the abuse of these bandits. In June 1945, I escaped to the uninhabited Ishikari County in Hokkaido, where I endured hunger and cold in a mountain cave, living like a wild animal for thirteen years. I understand that these are all crimes committed by Japanese militarism. When Japan invaded China, so many of our elders, brothers, and sisters were innocently killed, so many houses were burned down. We Chinese people suffered enough from the Japanese invaders. Today, U.S. imperialism is reviving Japanese militarism and wants Japan to embark on the old path of fascism of foreign aggression again. I will resolutely not agree to this!"

Liu Lianren said: "Recently, the people in the capital and across the country have been holding rallies and demonstrations, resolutely opposing the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and firmly supporting the heroic struggle of the Japanese people. I traveled all the way from my hometown of Gaomi County to Jinan to participate in the 300,000-person rally here. At the meeting, I shouted: The U.S. and Japanese reactionaries are our enemies, and we will not allow the Japanese invaders to bully us again."

Liu Lianren said angrily to the reporter: "The Kishida Nobusuke government of Japan is reactionary and sinful. I hate it to the core. However, the Japanese people are kind and peace-loving. When I left Japan to return to my country, countless Japanese people came to the seaside to see me off. They gave me clothes, snacks, and a large number of letters of sympathy. They prayed that I would return to my motherland safely. At that time, we all expressed our hope that the Chinese and Japanese people would be forever friendly and never fight, and live together in peace and friendship. Although I am now in Shandong, far away from Japan, I am always concerned about and support the patriotic and just struggle of the Japanese people."

Liu Lianren finally warned the U.S. and Japanese imperialists: "China is no longer the old China it used to be. We oppose aggression and also have the power to eliminate the aggressors!"

    饱受日本强盗残害终于回到祖国的刘连仁说：
    不允许日本走法西斯老路
    新华社济南14日电　曾经被日本帝国主义掳去，被迫在日本北海道荒山里过了十三年非人生活的刘连仁，在济南向新华社记者发表谈话。他表示坚决反对日美军事同盟条约、坚决支持日本人民的爱国正义斗争。
    刘连仁现在是高密县井沟人民公社细菌肥料厂的厂长，他激愤地向记者说：“当我在报纸上看到日美签订军事同盟条约，策划新的侵略战争的阴谋的消息后，我气愤极了！”
    刘连仁说：“我要向全世界人民控诉日本帝国主义的罪行。1944年秋天，我被日本强盗从家乡山东高密县掳到日本北海道，在那里的矿山中被迫作劳工，成天像牛马一样地工作，日本法西斯分子还时常拿鞭子打我们，后来我实在再也受不了这些强盗的虐待，在1945年6月逃到荒无人烟的北海道石狩郡，在山洞里忍饥挨冻，过了十三年野兽一般的生活。我明白，这些都是日本军国主义犯下的罪。日本侵略中国时，我们多少父老姐妹被无辜杀害，多少房屋被烧光，我们中国人民受够了日本侵略者的苦，今天美帝国主义又在复活日本军国主义，又要使日本走上向外侵略的法西斯老路，我坚决不答应！”
    刘连仁说：“最近，首都和全国各地人民都在集会和举行示威游行，坚决反对日美军事同盟条约，坚决支持日本人民的英勇斗争。我从家乡高密县远道赶到济南，参加了这里三十万人的大会。我在会上高呼：美日反动派是我们的敌人，我们不允许日本侵略者再来欺负我们”。
    刘连仁气愤地向记者说：“日本岸信介政府是反动的、罪恶的，我恨透了它。但是，日本人民是善良的，爱好和平的。在我离开日本回国时，无数的日本人民到海边来欢送我，他们送给我衣服、点心和大批慰问信，他们祈祷我一路平安回到祖国。当时我们都表示希望中日两国人民永远友好、永远不打仗，和平友好相处。我现在虽然在远离日本的山东，但是我时刻关心着和支持日本人民的爱国正义斗争。”
    刘连仁最后警告日美帝国主义者：“中国不再是以前的旧中国了，我们反对侵略，也有力量消灭侵略者！”
