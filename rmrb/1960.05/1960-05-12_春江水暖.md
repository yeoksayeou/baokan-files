    Spring River Thawing

    "Factory buildings connected, chimneys facing each other, machine sounds audible, never interacting until old age and death." This is a depiction of the relationship between some factories in Harbin in the past. Neighboring factories that had been together for many years each had their own affiliations; you thought he was in light industry and unrelated to me, he thought you were a large heavy industry factory, "too big to ask for help"; therefore, you didn't ask me and I didn't ask you. For the sake of matching parts for a product, something that could have been resolved in a place so close by, they would rather go far away, thousands of miles, to Beijing or Shanghai for cooperation. Once, the neighboring Harbin Steel Rolling Plant and Harbin Brewery, because of borrowing tools from each other, affected their own production, and some workers complained, "The leaders are meddling in other people's business." That's how they previously limited their vision to the narrow world of their own unit.
    The establishment of urban people's communes has brought us an extraordinary spring! Old neighbors become new friends, and the flowers of communist cooperation bloom all over the land under the cultivation and illumination of fertile soil and warm sunshine. The toothed wheel of the brewery's saccharification pot suddenly broke, seriously affecting the completion of the production plan. Although the steel rolling plant's own production was also very tight, it did not hesitate and immediately provided support, working overnight to rush-produce a set of toothed wheels, and even made an extra set for backup. When a workshop director at the steel rolling plant brought the job of supporting the brewery and said to his factory's workers, "Put down your own work and do this first!" the workers initially didn't know it was for the brewery and said, "Wait a moment." The director said, "This is what our commune's brewery urgently needs!" The workers smiled and said, "Wouldn't it have been done if you had said that earlier?" They immediately put down their own factory's work and took it over. These two factories shared a power supply line. Due to insufficient power, the power department had to reduce the power supply time on this line every few days. Each time the power was cut, the steel rolling plant had to reduce production, and the steel rolling high-temperature furnace could even be burned due to lack of water supply, and might even explode. The brewery's Party committee decided that whenever the power supply was reduced, it would allocate all the power it generated, enough to supply three key production equipment, to support the steel rolling plant. The steel rolling plant's power supply problem was solved, but soon the steel rolling high-temperature furnace broke down again, urgently requiring gas welding repair. At that time, the brewery's gas welding team was working on a task that had to be completed within five days, but the gas welding team leader, Yu Yungong, said after hearing the news, "The steel rolling plant's production task is more important than ours, we must send people to support them."
    From not caring about "other people's business" to "we must send people to support them," is a huge and profound change. In capitalist society, the bourgeoisie, whose souls are infiltrated by money, only care about the profits of their own enterprises. As for other enterprises, they not only do not care about them at all, but also try to squeeze each other out and attempt to annex them! After liberation, our socialist enterprises are fundamentally different in nature from capitalist enterprises. The phenomenon of squeezing out and annexation has naturally lost its basis and can no longer occur. The spirit of communist cooperation has also been greatly promoted. However, that old ideology still remains, more or less, among many of our socialist enterprises, and that is the style of departmentalism. Although this style is not for the benefit of any individual, it still belongs to the narrow category of bourgeois thought. It is like dust, blinding people's eyes. The establishment of urban people's communes has brought new production relations and new organizational forms to our cities. Under the unified leadership of the commune, people's horizons have broadened, they have seen the surrounding things, understood each other's production situation, and the overall concept has been strengthened. If you have difficulties, I will support you, and if I have difficulties, you will help me. A close relationship has been established between neighbors. Therefore, the flowers of communist cooperation, in the new fertile soil, have been newly nourished and are flourishing.
    "Peach blossoms in twos and threes beyond the bamboo, the duck is the first to know when the spring river warms." This is Su Dongpo's poem describing the spring scenery. The close cooperation between the Harbin Steel Rolling Plant and the Brewery, from not interacting to close cooperation, are two of the countless flowers blooming in our spring. Only caring about oneself, only caring about one's own unit, these are all products left to us by capitalist society, they are ice blocks in the cold winter river. Now, the sun is shining, the spring river is thawing, dissolving all the ice blocks left over from the old society. These ice blocks, in the socialist spring, under the sunshine of the urban people's commune, will be eliminated without a trace!

    春江水暖

    “厂房相连，烟囱相望，机声相闻，老死不相往来。”这是哈尔滨有些工厂过去相互关系的写照。相处多年的邻厂，先前各有各的隶属关系，你认为他是轻工业，与我无关，他认为你是重工业大厂，“厂大难求”；于是，你不求我我不求你，为了一件产品的配套，原可以在咫尺之地求得解决的，然而宁可舍近求远，千里迢迢，到北京、上海去求协作。有一次，相邻的哈尔滨轧钢厂和哈尔滨啤酒厂因为相互借用工具，影响了自己的生产，有的工人便埋怨说：“领导多管闲事。”他们先前就是这样把自己的眼光局限在自己一个单位的狭小天地里。
    城市人民公社建立了，它为我们带来了不平凡的春天！旧邻成新友，共产主义协作之花，在肥沃的土壤、和煦的阳光培育、照耀下，开满大地。啤酒厂的糖化锅的牙轮突然坏了，严重地影响了生产计划的完成，轧钢厂虽然自己的生产也很紧，但毫不犹豫，立刻支援，连夜赶制出了一套牙轮，而且还多制了一套备用。当轧钢厂一位车间主任把支援啤酒厂的活拿来，向自己厂的工人说：“把自己的活卸下来，先干这个吧！”工人们开头不知道是啤酒厂的活，说道：“等一等。”主任说：“这是咱们公社啤酒厂急用的活！”工人们笑着说：“你早这样说不就完了吗。”他们马上放下自己厂的工作，把它接了过去。这两个厂是共同用一条供电线路的，由于电力不足，电业部门隔些日子就要在这条线路减少一些供电时间。每停一次电，轧钢厂就要减产，轧钢高温炉也有因为没有电送不进水而烧毁的可能，甚至会爆炸。啤酒厂党委会决定，每逢减少供电时，就把自己发出的能供三台生产关键设备使用的电力全部支援轧钢厂。轧钢厂的供电问题解决了，可是不久轧钢高温炉又坏了，急需气焊抢修，当时啤酒厂气焊小组正在突击一个五天内要完成的任务，可是气焊小组组长于云公听到消息后说：“轧钢厂的生产任务比我们重要，说啥也得派人支援他们。”
    从不管“闲事”到“说啥也得派人支援他们”，是一个巨大而深刻的变化。在资本主义社会里，被金钱渗透了灵魂的资产阶级，关心的就是自己企业的利润，至于别的企业，他们岂止毫不关心，而且还要互相倾轧，企图并吞哩！解放了，我们的社会主义企业，对资本主义企业来说，性质上是根本不同的，倾轧、并吞的现象固然失去了它的基础，因而不可能再发生，共产主义协作的精神也大大发扬了。然而，那种旧的思想意识，仍然或多或少地残存在我们不少社会主义企业之间，这就是本位主义的作风。尽管这种作风，如今并非为某一个人的利益，但它仍然是属于狭隘的资产阶级思想范畴的。它像灰尘一样，迷住人们的眼界。城市人民公社的建立，使我们的城市出现了新的生产关系和新的组织形式，人们在公社的统一领导下，眼界扩大了，看到了周围的事物，了解了彼此的生产情况，整体观念加强了，你有困难我支援，我有困难你帮助，近邻之间建立了亲切的关系；于是，共产主义协作之花，在新的肥沃的土壤里，得到了新的滋润，蓬蓬勃勃地开放出来。
    “竹外桃花三两枝，春江水暖鸭先知。”这是苏东坡描写春景的诗句。哈尔滨轧钢厂和啤酒厂之间由互不来往到密切协作，是我们这春天里开放出来无数鲜花中的两枝。只管自己、只管本单位，这一切都是资本主义社会遗留给我们的产物，它们是寒冬江水中的冰块。如今，阳光普照，春江水暖，溶解着旧社会遗留下来的一切冰块。这些冰块，在社会主义的春天里，受着城市人民公社阳光的照耀，将消灭得无影无踪！
