Xinhua News Agency, Jinan Electric Dispatch: In the movement of technical innovation and technical revolution, coal mine workers across the country have recently created more than twenty types of rock electric drills to replace pneumatic drills for tunneling. These machines have significant effects in achieving high-speed tunneling and improving workers' working conditions. The creation and widespread use of this type of machinery is a major revolution in China's coal industry.

Tunneling is the first process in coal production, so high-speed tunneling is a prerequisite for the continuous leap forward of coal production at high speed. At present, the main tool for tunneling in coal mines across the country is the pneumatic drill driven by an air compressor. As tunnels are extended day by day, the air power is often insufficient, and the tunneling speed is difficult to increase. Therefore, tunneling with pneumatic drills is no longer well adapted to the current situation of a series of innovations in coal mining methods and tools across the country.

In the vigorous movement of technical innovation and technical revolution, many coal mine workers and some scientific research units, under the leadership of the Party, adopted methods such as joint research by cadres, workers, and technicians, and the combination of scientific research personnel, teachers and students of universities and colleges with factories and mines. After countless repeated experiments, they created more than twenty different types of rock electric drills. Most of these electric drills share common characteristics: simple structure, lightweight and durable, easy to manufacture, and easy to operate. Moreover, the drilling speed is fast, and they can generally be used on rocks with a hardness coefficient of seven or less (the hardness coefficient of most rocks in China's coal mines is below seven). Xinwen, Hegang and other coal mines use electric drills for tunneling, which increases the tunneling speed by one to two times compared to using pneumatic drills. Using electric drills, there is no vibration or noise, and the flying rock dust is eliminated, greatly improving labor conditions and reducing the labor intensity of workers. The widespread adoption of electric drills can also free up the entire set of pneumatic equipment currently used in coal mines, and new mines can also save this type of equipment. This can save construction funds and speed up the construction of mines. After Xinwen Mining Bureau used electric drills instead of pneumatic drills, electricity consumption was also reduced by one-sixth.

Coal mine workers in various places have also created various powered rock loading machines. When this loading machine is used in conjunction with electric drills, it can eliminate heavy labor in tunneling work.

Recently, the Ministry of Coal Industry and the National Committee of the China Coal Mine Trade Union jointly held a national on-site conference at the Xinwen Mining Bureau in Shandong to exchange experiences in manufacturing and using rock electric drills and rock loading machines, in order to rapidly promote advanced experiences such as rock electric drills throughout the country.

### 煤矿巷道掘进大革命  电钻代风钻效率翻番

    煤矿巷道掘进大革命
    电钻代风钻效率翻番
    据新华社济南电　全国煤矿职工在技术革新和技术革命的运动中，最近创造出二十多种代替风钻掘进巷道的岩石电钻。这种机械在实现高速度掘进和改善工人劳动条件等方面，具有显著的效果。这种机械的创造和广泛地使用，是我国煤炭工业中一项重大的革命。
    掘进巷道是煤炭生产过程中的第一道工序，因此，高速度掘进巷道是煤炭生产高速度的持续跃进的前提条件。目前全国煤矿掘进巷道的工具主要是以压风机带动的风钻。由于巷道逐日延长，风力往往不足，掘进速度难以提高。因此，用风钻掘进，和当前全国采煤方法和采煤工具一系列革新的情况已不大相适应。
    在蓬勃的技术革新和技术革命的运动中，很多煤矿职工和一些科学研究单位，在党的领导下，采取干部、工人、技术人员共同研究，科学研究人员、高等院校的师生与厂矿结合等办法，经过无数次的反复试验，创造出二十多种不同类型的岩石电钻。这些电钻大部分的共同特点是结构简单，轻便耐用，制造容易，操作方便，并且钻进速度快，一般能在岩石硬度系数七级以下的岩石上使用（我国煤矿绝大部分岩石硬度系数都在七级以下）。新汶、鹤岗等煤矿使用电钻掘进，比用风钻掘进速度提高一倍到二倍。用电钻既没有什么震动和杂音，也消灭了飞扬的岩尘，大大地改善了劳动条件，减轻了工人的劳动强度。广泛地采用电钻，还可以把目前煤矿上使用一整套的风动设备腾出来，新建矿井也可以省掉这类设备。这样就可以节约建设资金、加快矿井的建设速度。新汶矿务局使用电钻代替风钻以后，电力的消耗也减少了六分之一。
    各地煤矿职工还创造了各种动力岩石扒装机。这种扒装机同电钻配套使用，就可以消灭掘进工作中的笨重劳动。
    最近，煤炭工业部和中国煤矿工会全国委员会在山东新汶矿务局联合召开了全国现场会议，交流制造和使用岩石电钻和岩石扒装机等方面的经验，以迅速在全国范围内普遍推广岩石电钻等先进经验。
