The youth of Jiujiang Special Zone, Jiangxi, planted 100,000 mu of rape experimental fields on high-yield fields, low-yield fields, and reclaimed wasteland. The average yield per mu was 54% higher than that of ordinary fields, and 1.4 times higher than the average yield last year. The yield of low-yield experimental fields also increased by 15% compared to last year's high-yield fields; the yield per mu of reclaimed wasteland reached 220 jin. The yields of these rape experimental fields have greatly broken the historical highest level of rape production in the region. These experimental fields not only established an archive system for the planting and management process, but also summarized the experience of high yields in a timely and systematic manner during harvesting.

    九江专区油菜试验田大丰收
    江西九江专区青年在高产田、低产田和开荒田上种植的十万亩油菜试验田，平均亩产比一般田高54％，比去年平均产量增加一点四倍。低产试验田的产量比去年的丰产田也增产15％；开荒田的亩产量达二百二十斤。这些油菜试验田的产量，大大地突破了本地区油菜产量的历史最高水平。这些试验田不仅建立了种植、管理过程中的档案制度，在收割时也及时系统地总结了丰产经验。
