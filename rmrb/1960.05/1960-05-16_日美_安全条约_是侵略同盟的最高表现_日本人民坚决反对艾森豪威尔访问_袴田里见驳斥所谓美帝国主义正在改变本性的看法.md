Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 14th: Hakamada Satomi, Secretary of the Central Secretariat of the Japanese Communist Party, pointed out that U.S. President Eisenhower's visit to Japan will not be welcomed by the Japanese people.

Hakamada Satomi made these remarks in response to questions from a reporter from the "Akahata" newspaper. Today's "Akahata" published Hakamada Satomi's comments.

Hakamada Satomi said, "How can we welcome President Eisenhower when we know that the U.S. government acts like a robber?"

He continued, "U.S. imperialism and the Kishi Nobusuke government both despise world peace. The newly signed U.S.-Japan Security Treaty is the highest manifestation of this aggressive alliance."

Hakamada Satomi warned, "According to the new treaty, U.S. troops stationed in Japan are very likely to take aggressive actions. Once this happens, Japan will become a target of immediate retaliation." He emphasized that the Japanese people must now draw a line between friends and enemies and resolutely oppose Eisenhower's visit to Japan.

Hakamada Satomi accused Eisenhower of instructing the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency to send spy jets into Soviet airspace, undermining the summit conference.

Hakamada Satomi refuted the view of some that U.S. imperialists are changing into a less aggressive force, saying that the U.S. government and Eisenhower himself have finally proven to be tools of aggressive U.S. monopoly capital.

Hakamada Satomi pointed out that Eisenhower was intent on undermining the summit conference, but he did not cancel his participation in the summit only because he feared being labeled a peace enemy.

Hakamada Satomi accused Eisenhower of attempting to undermine the summit from within, saying that the U.S.'s proposal of the infamous "Open Skies" plan to the summit was one manifestation of the gangster-like intentions of U.S. imperialism. He continued, saying that imposing the "Open Skies" proposal on the world is tantamount to demanding that the skies of the entire world be unilaterally opened to U.S. spy planes.

    日美“安全条约”是侵略同盟的最高表现

    袴田里见驳斥所谓美帝国主义正在改变本性的看法
    新华社14日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央书记局书记袴田里见指出，美国总统艾森豪威尔访问日本决不会受到日本人民的欢迎。
    袴田里见是在回答“赤旗报”记者提出的问题时说这番话的。今天的“赤旗报”刊载了袴田里见的谈话。
    袴田里见说，“当我们知道美国政府像强盗那样行事的时候，我们如何能够欢迎艾森豪威尔总统呢？”
    他继续说，“美帝国主义者和岸信介政府都蔑视世界和平。新签订的美日安全条约是这种侵略同盟的最高表现。”
    袴田里见警告说，“根据新的条约驻在日本的美国军队很有可能采取侵略行动。一旦这种事情发生，日本将成为立即受到回击的目标”。他强调说，日本人民现在必须在朋友和敌人之间划清界线，并且坚决反对艾森豪威尔访问日本。
    袴田里见指责艾森豪威尔指示美国中央情报局派遣间谍喷气机侵入苏联领空，破坏最高级会议。
    袴田里见驳斥某些人所谓美帝国主义者正在改变成为不那么具有侵略性的力量的看法，他说，美国政府和艾森豪威尔本人终于证明是侵略性的美国垄断资本的工具。
    袴田里见指出，艾森豪威尔一心想破坏最高级会议，但是他所以不取消参加最高级会议只是因为他害怕背上恰如其分的和平敌人的罪名。
    袴田里见指责艾森豪威尔企图从内部破坏最高级会议，他说，美国向最高级会议提出臭名昭彰的“开放天空”的计划是美帝国主义者强盗式意图的表现之一。他继续说，因为把“开放天空”建议强加于世界就等于要求全世界的天空都单方面地向美国的间谍飞机开放。
