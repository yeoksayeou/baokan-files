U.S. imperialism has reached the height of its wickedness. No matter how it struggles, it will inevitably die, and will certainly be resolutely, thoroughly and completely eliminated by the people like flies, bedbugs, rats, and mosquitoes.

Xinhua News Agency, 4th: Over 50,000 young people and people from all walks of life in the capital held a rally today to support the patriotic and just struggle of the Turkish people, and resolutely opposed the U.S. imperialism and its running dog, the Menderes reactionary ruling clique, for suppressing the Turkish patriotic people.

The conference issued a strong voice: "The 600 million Chinese people are a strong backing for the Turkish people's struggle!" "U.S. imperialism, get out of Turkey! Get out of Taiwan, our territory!"

Today is the 41st anniversary of the great historical "May Fourth" Movement. Forty-one years ago, Beijing students held a large demonstration in front of Tiananmen Square to oppose imperialist aggression and the traitorous crimes of the feudal warlords. The Beijing youth with a glorious revolutionary tradition have great sympathy for and firm support for the anti-imperialist patriotic struggle of the Turkish youth and the broad masses of the people. Many schools have held small-scale gatherings in the past few days. Today, they and the capital's workers, urban and suburban people's commune members, People's Liberation Army soldiers, militiamen, and government cadres, formed a mighty team, carrying red flags and various slogans, passed through Tiananmen Square, and surged to the square in front of the Hall of Supreme Harmony in the Forbidden City.

The conference was held at 3:00 p.m. Hu Yaobang, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, said at the meeting that the Chinese people have infinite sympathy for all oppressed nations, and supporting the just struggle of all oppressed nations is the lofty international duty of the Chinese people and youth, and the 600 million Chinese people are a strong backing for the Turkish people's struggle.

Lin Boqu and Peng Zhen, members of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Wang Jiaxiang, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee, Liu Lantao, alternate secretary, Luo Ruiqing, Vice Premier of the State Council, and Saifuddin and Lin Feng, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, attended the conference. Guo Moruo, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Fu Zuoyi, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council, Liu Ren, Second Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Wan Li, Vice Mayor of Beijing, and General Xiao Hua, Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army also attended the meeting.

Before the meeting began, the crowd on the square enthusiastically sang various revolutionary songs. Red flags were everywhere on the square, and huge banners were hung on the surrounding buildings: "Resolutely support the patriotic and just struggle of the Turkish people!" "Resolutely oppose U.S. imperialism and its running dogs enslaving and massacring Turkish patriotic people!" "Support the anti-imperialist and patriotic struggle of all oppressed nations!" "People of the world, Unite! Down with imperialism! Down with colonialism!" "U.S. imperialism, get out from Turkey! Get out of South Korea! Get out of South Vietnam! Get out of Japan! Get out of the Philippines! Get out of Taiwan, China!"

After Wang Zhaohua, First Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, announced the start of the conference, Hu Yaobang spoke first, expressing the greatest respect and firm support for the heroic Turkish people. He emphasized that the 650 million Chinese people will always be the most loyal and reliable friends of all oppressed nations. The struggle of all oppressed people for national independence, democratic freedom cannot be restrained. The law of human history cannot be changed by anyone. (Full text of the speech on page four)

Hu Yaobang's speech constantly aroused stormy and warm applause from the audience. Finally, he led more than 50,000 people in the audience to shout slogans. At this time, the shouts of "U.S. imperialism, get out of Turkey!" "Down with imperialism!" "Down with colonialism!" resounded through the sky.

The Turkish people will carry out the patriotic and just struggle to the end, and they will surely achieve the final victory

Xu Zhizhen, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, then spoke, expressing that the Chinese workers firmly support the patriotic and just struggle of the Turkish people. Xu Zhizhen said that Turkey is a base for the U.S. war of aggression in Asia. Under the enslavement of U.S. imperialism, workers and people live inhuman lives. Workers' wages are very low. They work more than 60 hours a week, and labor conditions are extremely bad. The enslaved Turkish people have reached the point where they can no longer tolerate such inhuman lives, they have to stand up and wage a resolute struggle against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs. The barbarous massacre by U.S. imperialism and the Turkish reactionaries has aroused even more fierce resistance from the Turkish people against U.S. imperialism. He emphasized that the flames of the struggle of the people of the world against U.S. imperialism are getting bigger and bigger. Imperialism and all reactionaries are bound to die.

Bao Erhan, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Asian-African Solidarity Committee and Director of the China Islamic Association, expressed his firm support and heartfelt respect to the brave Turkish youth and people on behalf of the Chinese People's Asian-African Solidarity Committee and the China Islamic Association in his speech.

Hu Naiqiu, Secretary of the Secretariat of the All-China Women's Federation, said at the meeting that the heroic struggle of the Turkish people once again proves that the people of all countries oppressed by U.S. imperialism and other imperialisms only have a way out through struggle, and only by defeating the imperialist forces can there be true independence and democracy. Hu Naiqiu expressed that Chinese women firmly support the struggles of the Turkish, South Korean and Japanese people, and resolutely support the struggles of all countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America against imperialism and colonialism. She said that as long as the Turkish people carry out the patriotic and just struggle to the end, they will surely achieve victory.

Cheng Qian, Vice Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, severely condemned U.S. imperialism at the meeting. He said that U.S. imperialism is the source of all disasters in the world today and the public enemy of the people of the world. Now, the days of U.S. imperialism, which is rampant everywhere and does all kinds of bad things, will not be long. There are volcanoes of people's uprisings everywhere under its feet. What is happening in South Korea, Japan and Turkey today may happen in South Vietnam, the Philippines and many Latin American countries tomorrow. He said that the fate of people like Menderes, Kishi Nobusuke, and Ngo Dinh Diem will never be better than the fate of Syngman Rhee. We firmly believe that the American aggressors and their running dogs will be burned to ashes in the raging fire of the struggles of the people of all countries.

Shi Liang, Vice Chairman of the China Democratic League, said that the fate of the oppressed people all over the world is the same. We have deep sympathy for the people of all countries who are carrying out patriotic and just struggles, and we express our infinite hatred for all imperialists and their running dog accomplices. She said, let the voice of our capital's people be heard in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. We will always stand by their side. She hopes that the people of the oppressed nations in these regions will persevere in their struggle and drive all reactionaries and their running dog accomplices, led by U.S. imperialism, out of their territories until the final victory.

Hu Zi'an, Vice Chairman of the China Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry & Commerce, expressed his deep sympathy and firm support for the Turkish people's patriotic and just struggle against the Menderes dictatorship on behalf of the CDNC and the All-China Federation of Industry & Commerce. He said that the Turkish people's patriotic and just struggle must achieve the final and complete victory.

The people of Asia, Africa and Latin America should unite closely and strengthen the anti-imperialist people's movement

Habbi, Chairman of the Democratic Union of French Somaliland in Africa and former Prime Minister, said at the meeting that the dark forces of American colonialism and imperialism are facing the victory of the Turkish people and have carried out brutal and terrorist activities in a frantic attempt to stop the irresistible trend of the people of Asia and Africa fighting for liberation. We request that all peace-loving people support the national liberation movement against imperialism and colonialism. Habbi emphasized that in this forward-moving world, people will no longer tolerate colonialism and imperialism for long. We call on all people in the world to take necessary measures to ensure the freedom, rights and dignity of the Turkish people. Finally, he shouted the slogan: "Down with imperialism and colonialism!"

Ali Shuker, head of the Iraqi Trade Union Delegation, emphasized that the reactionaries' prisons, gallows, terror, and guns cannot resist the will of the people of all countries. The Turkish people are bound to defeat imperialism and the reactionaries, and will get rid of the aggressive Central Treaty Organization. He said that Turkey's participation in the Central Treaty Organization seriously threatens us Iraqis. We believe that the member states of this treaty threaten the independence of our country. We are convinced that what the Turkish people demand is not a military alliance, but good-neighborliness and non-interference in other countries' internal affairs, and to realize democracy and freedom, and eliminate unemployment, hunger, ignorance and disease.

Ali Shuker pointed out that imperialism is stepping up the creation of international tension, adopting a cold war policy, establishing military bases for missiles, atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, organizing military groups, and interfering in other countries' internal affairs. However, the strength of the people of all countries is now stronger. The American paper tiger will inevitably be crushed by the struggle of the people of all countries.

Edmundo Polanco, a trade union representative from Chile in Latin America, expressed his support for the struggle of the Turkish people at the meeting, and wished the Turkish people to continue their struggle until they see their motherland get rid of domestic and foreign oppression. Polanco said that in Latin America, the anti-imperialist people's movement is on the rise. To strengthen the anti-imperialist people's movement, it is necessary to unite closely with the people of all countries who are fighting for the common goal of economic liberation and peace. It is for this reason that we support the struggle of the Turkish people. The blood of the Turkish youth and working class tells the tyrants and their masters that the struggle of the oppressed people for liberation is at any cost. He also said that we also stand with the heroic Cuban people. We regard their revolution as our own, because it has crossed the scope of an island and become a revolution of the entire Latin American continent.

A young friend from Africa, where the anti-colonialist movement is surging—Gbabou Dominique, National Chairman of the Youth League of the Congo National Movement Party, said at the meeting: The Congolese youth actively support the struggle of the Turkish people until the American robbers are eliminated. He said that oppressors never bestow independence on the oppressed people. In order to change that intolerable and miserable situation, the youth realize that their task is to eliminate the armed forces of imperialism. In his speech, he strongly condemned U.S. imperialism, which is hated by the African people. He said that it is U.S. imperialism that supports France's aggressive forces in Algeria, and it is U.S. imperialism that helps France explode destructive weapons in the Sahara. Dominique said that in the process of the Congolese revolution, the United States, proceeding from its desire to rule the people of Asia and Africa, helped Belgium fabricate a vague statement without the participation of the Congolese, in an attempt to prolong Belgium's exploitation policy in the Congo. This statement proposed "independence in stages" without even mentioning internal autonomy. The Belgian colonial government used various brutal means such as intimidation and arrests to weaken the will of the people, but it always ran into trouble in the face of the people's will.

Young students must become a heroic shock brigade in the anti-imperialist struggle

Liu Huizhang, a young blast furnace foreman of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, representing the young workers of the capital, said that our personal experience tells us that U.S. imperialism is the root of all disasters and pains. Wolves always eat people. Only by defeating them and completely eliminating them can the people have a peaceful and happy life. We believe that the days of U.S. imperialism, which is doing evil everywhere, are not far away.

Du Kewen, Secretary of the Communist Youth League Committee of the Lugouqiao People's Commune in Beijing, representing the young farmers of the capital, said that U.S. imperialism has reached the height of its wickedness. No matter how it struggles, it will inevitably die, and must be resolutely, thoroughly and completely eliminated by the people like flies, bedbugs, rats, and mosquitoes.

Pan Lihua, a student of Tsinghua University, said in her speech, on behalf of the students of the capital, she paid high tribute to the Turkish youth students who stood at the forefront of the anti-imperialist and patriotic struggle, and expressed her firm and full support for their just struggle. She said that the demonstrations of Turkish youth students were met with barbarous bloody massacres by the Menderes reactionaries fostered by U.S. imperialism. The bullets made in the United States took the lives of the youth, and the U.S.-made tanks rushed into the school gates. However, the brutal suppression of the people cannot save it from its doomed fate. Wherever there is imperialist rule, the people there will rise up to resist. Everywhere under the feet of the imperialists is a volcano that can be triggered at any moment. Finally, she called on all oppressed nations and all colonial and semi-colonial students to unite and act as the most heroic and active shock brigade in the great and glorious anti-imperialist struggle to overthrow imperialism.

The speeches at the conference were warmly welcomed by the people. Warm applause and deafening slogans resounded throughout the venue.

After the speeches at the conference, the "Message of the Capital Youth and People from All Walks of Life of the People's Republic of China Supporting the Patriotic and Just Struggle of the Turkish People" was read out.

After the telegram was read out, 2,000 young people in the capital sang in unison: "National Salvation March", "Guerrilla Song", "We Must Liberate Taiwan" and "Unity is Strength" and other revolutionary songs. As soon as the songs of 2,000 people fell, more than 50,000 people in the audience stood up in unison, and then sang "Unity is Strength" in unison. In the majestic singing, a batch of colored balloons rose into the air, carrying "Resolutely support the patriotic and just struggle of the Turkish people!" "Support the anti-imperialist and patriotic struggle of all oppressed nations!" "People of the world, unite! Down with imperialism! Down with colonialism!" and other huge banners.

The youths and students showed great enthusiasm today. Some came from more than 20 miles away to participate in the conference, and some compiled skits, wrote big-character posters and slogans, and carried out propaganda along the way. Many students from Tsinghua University held forums last night and this morning. Today, students, young teachers, and staff from this school also held a special conference and passed a resolution supporting the revolutionary struggle of Turkish youth students. Many foreign students also volunteered to participate in the conference. Some students from Turkey's neighboring countries—Cyprus, Iran, and Iraq—are very concerned about the development of the situation in Turkey and expressed their firm support for the revolution of the Turkish people. Zobos, a Cypriot student at Peking University, said that we are neighbors with Turkey. This dictatorial country is not a good neighbor, but the relationship between the people of our two countries is close. 25% of the people in Cyprus are Turkish. We oppose U.S. imperialism turning Turkey into a U.S. military base, and we firmly support the struggle of the Turkish people.

Also attending today's conference were heads of government departments, people's organizations, and democratic parties. Among them were Liao Chengzhi, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, Liu Ningyi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Luo Yi, Hu Keshi, Wang Wei, and Yang Haibo, Secretaries of the Communist Youth League Secretariat, Zeng Delin, Alternate Secretary, Zhang Chao, Vice Chairman of the All-China Youth Federation, Hu Qili, Chairman of the All-China Students Federation, Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, Wang Shao'ao, Vice Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, Ji Fang, Chairman of the Presidium of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party Central Committee, Chen Qiyou, Chairman of the China Zhi Gong Party, Xu Deheng, Chairman of the Jiusan Society, Xu Mengshan, Secretary-General of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, Wang Jiong, Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, Zhang Jinlin, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, presidents of Beijing universities and colleges, and people from all walks of life in the capital.

专栏：

    美帝国主义从土耳其滚出去！从南朝鲜滚出去！从南越滚出去！从日本滚出去！从菲律宾滚出去！从我国台湾滚出去！
    美帝国主义已经恶贯满盈了，不管它怎样挣扎，最后一定要死亡，一定要像苍蝇、臭虫、老鼠、蚊子一样被人民坚决、彻底、全部消灭掉。
    据新华社4日讯　首都青年和各界人民五万多人，今天举行支持土耳其人民爱国正义斗争大会，坚决反对美帝国主义及其走狗曼德列斯反动统治集团镇压土耳其爱国人民。
    大会发出强烈的声音：“六亿中国人民是土耳其人民斗争的强大后盾！”“美帝国主义从土耳其滚出去！从我国的领土台湾滚出去！”
    今天是具有伟大历史意义“五四”运动四十一周年纪念日。四十一年前，北京的学生为了反对帝国主义侵略、反对封建军阀的卖国罪行，在天安门前举行了大示威。有着光辉的革命传统的北京青年，对于土耳其的青年学生和广大人民的反帝爱国斗争，寄予极大的同情和坚决的支持，许多学校这几天都举行了小规模的集会。今天，他们同首都的工人、城市和郊区人民公社社员、解放军战士、民兵和机关干部等，结成浩浩荡荡的队伍，打着红旗和各式各样的标语牌，经过天安门广场，涌向故宫太和殿前的广场。
    大会在下午三时举行。共青团中央第一书记胡耀邦在会上说，中国人民对一切被压迫民族怀着无限的同情，支持一切被压迫民族的正义斗争，是中国人民和青年的崇高的国际义务，六亿中国人民是土耳其人民斗争的强大后盾。
    中共中央政治局委员林伯渠、彭真，中央书记处书记王稼祥，候补书记刘澜涛，国务院副总理罗瑞卿，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长赛福鼎、林枫等参加了大会。参加大会的还有政协全国委员会副主席郭沫若，国防委员会副主席傅作义，中共北京市委第二书记刘仁，北京市副市长万里，中国人民解放军总政治部副主任萧华上将。
    大会开始以前，广场上的人群激昂地唱着各种革命歌曲。广场上红旗林立，周围建筑物上高悬巨幅标语：“坚决支持土耳其人民的爱国正义斗争！”“坚决反对美帝国主义及其走狗奴役和屠杀土耳其爱国人民！”“支持一切被压迫民族的反帝爱国斗争！”“世界人民团结起来！打倒帝国主义！打倒殖民主义！”“美帝国主义从土耳其滚出去！从南朝鲜滚出去！从南越滚出去！从日本滚出去！从菲律宾滚出去！从我国台湾滚出去！”
    共青团北京市委第一书记王照华宣布大会开始以后，胡耀邦首先讲话，他对英勇斗争的土耳其人民，表示最大的敬意和坚决的支持。他强调说，六亿五千万中国人民，永远是一切被压迫民族最忠实、最可靠的朋友。一切被压迫人民争取民族独立、民主自由的斗争，都是束缚不住的。人类历史发展的规律，是任何人改变不了的。（讲话全文见第四版）
    胡耀邦的讲话，不断激起全场暴风雨般的热烈掌声。最后，他领导全场五万多人高呼口号，这时，“美帝国主义从土耳其滚出去！”“打倒帝国主义！”“打倒殖民主义！”的呼声响彻云霄。
    土耳其人民把爱国正义斗争进行到底，就一定能取得最后胜利
    中华全国总工会副主席许之桢接着讲话，他表示，中国工人坚决支持土耳其人民的爱国正义斗争。许之桢说，土耳其是美国在亚洲的侵略战争基地，在美帝国主义的奴役下，工人和人民过着非人的生活，工人工资十分低微，他们一周劳动六十小时以上，劳动条件极其恶劣，被奴役的土耳其人民到了再也不能忍受这种非人生活的时候，不能不起来同美帝国主义及其走狗作坚决的斗争。美帝国主义和土耳其反动派的野蛮屠杀，已激起了土耳其人民对美帝国主义的更加激烈的反抗。他强调说，全世界人民共同反对美帝国主义的斗争烈火越来越大。帝国主义和一切反动派必然要死亡。
    中国亚非团结委员会副主席、中国伊斯兰教协会主任包尔汉在讲话中，代表中国亚非团结委员会和中国伊斯兰教协会，向勇敢的土耳其青年和人民表示坚决的支持和衷心的敬意。
  （讲话全文见第四版）
    全国妇联书记处书记胡耐秋在会上说，土耳其人民的英勇斗争，再一次证明：在美帝国主义和其他帝国主义压迫下的各国人民，只有斗争才有出路，只有打垮帝国主义势力才有真正的独立和民主。胡耐秋表示，中国妇女坚决支持土耳其、南朝鲜和日本人民的斗争，坚决支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲所有反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义的各国人民的斗争。她说，只要土耳其人民把爱国正义斗争进行到底，他们就一定能够取得胜利。
    中国国民党革命委员会副主席程潜在会上严厉地谴责美帝国主义。他说，美帝国主义是今天世界上一切祸害的根源，是世界人民的公敌。现在，到处横行霸道、干尽坏事的美帝国主义的寿命不会很长了，在它的脚下处处都是人民起义的火山，今天在南朝鲜、日本和土耳其发生的事情，明天就可能在南越、菲律宾和拉丁美洲许多国家出现。他说，曼德列斯、岸信介、吴庭艳之流的命运，绝不会比李承晚的命运更好一些。我们坚决相信：美国侵略者和它的走狗们，必将在各国人民斗争的烈火中烧得一干二净。
    中国民主同盟副主席史良说，全世界被压迫人民的命运是一致的。我们对于进行着爱国正义斗争的各国人民寄以深厚的同情，对一切帝国主义者及其走狗帮凶们表示无比的愤恨。她说，让我们首都人民的声音，传到亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲去，我们永远站在他们一边。她希望这些地区被压迫民族的人民，把斗争坚持下去，把以美帝国主义为首的一切反动派及其走狗帮凶们，从自己的领土赶出去，直到最后胜利。
    中国民主建国会、中华全国工商业联合会副主任委员胡子昂代表民建、全国工商联，对土耳其人民反对曼德列斯独裁统治的爱国正义斗争，表示深切的同情和坚决支持。他说，土耳其人民的爱国正义斗争一定要取得最后的、彻底的胜利。
    亚非和拉丁美洲人民紧密团结起来，加强反帝国主义的人民运动
    法属非洲索马里兰民主联盟主席、前总理哈比在会上说，美国殖民主义和帝国主义的阴暗势力，面临着土耳其人民的胜利，疯狂地进行了残暴和恐怖的活动，企图阻止不可抗拒的亚非人民争取解放的潮流。我们请求一切爱好和平人民都支持反对帝国主义和殖民主义的民族解放运动。哈比强调说，在这个向前发展的世界上，人们不会再长期地忍受殖民主义和帝国主义了。我们号召全世界一切人民都采取必要的措施，以保障土耳其人民的自由权利和尊严。最后他高呼口号：“打倒帝国主义和殖民主义！”
    伊拉克工会代表团团长阿里·舒克尔强调说，反动派的监狱、绞架、恐怖和枪弹抵御不了各国人民的意志。土耳其人民势必战胜帝国主义和反动派，并将摆脱侵略的中央条约组织。他说，土耳其参加了中央条约组织，严重地威胁着我们伊拉克人，我们认为这一条约的成员国威胁着我们国家的独立。我们确信土耳其人民要求的不是军事同盟，而是要求睦邻亲善不干涉他国内政，要求实现民主自由，消灭失业、饥饿、无知与疾病。
    阿里·舒克尔指出，帝国主义加紧制造国际紧张局势，采取冷战政策，建立导弹、原子武器和氢武器等的军事基地，组织军事集团，干涉别国内政。但是，现在各国人民的力量更加壮大。美国纸老虎必然为各国人民的斗争所粉碎。
    来自拉丁美洲的智利工会代表爱得蒙多·波兰科，在会上表示支持土耳其人民的斗争，并预祝土耳其人民继续进行斗争，直到看到他们祖国摆脱了国内与外国的压迫为止。波兰科说，在拉丁美洲，反帝的人民运动正在高涨。要加强反帝的人民运动，必须同所有为经济解放和和平的共同目标而斗争的各国人民紧密团结起来。正是为了这个原因，我们支持土耳其人民的斗争。土耳其的青年和工人阶级的鲜血告诉了暴君和他们的主子，被压迫的人民争取解放的斗争是不惜任何牺牲的。他还说，我们也同英雄的古巴人民站在一起，我们把他们的革命当做我们自己的事情，因为它已越过了一个岛的范围而成为整个拉丁美洲大陆的革命。
    来自反殖民主义运动高涨的非洲青年朋友——刚果民族运动党青年联盟全国主席格巴布·多米尼克在会上表示：刚果青年积极支持土耳其人民的斗争，直到消灭美国强盗为止。他说，压迫者从来不会把独立赐予被压迫的人民。为了改变那种不可容忍的悲惨处境，青年们认识到他们的任务是消灭帝国主义武装力量。他在讲话中强烈地谴责非洲人民所痛恨的美帝国主义，他说，正是美帝国主义支持法国在阿尔及利亚的侵略势力，正是美帝国主义帮助法国在撒哈拉爆炸毁灭性武器。多米尼克说，在刚果革命过程中，美国从其统治亚非人民的欲望出发，帮助比利时在没有刚果人参加下制造出一篇含糊其词的声明，妄图延长比利时对刚果的剥削政策。这个声明提出“分阶段独立”，而连内部自治也避而不谈。比利时殖民政府为了削弱人民的意志，施用了种种恐吓、逮捕等残暴手段，但是，它总是在人民的意志面前碰得头破血流。
    青年同学要成为反帝斗争中的英勇的突击队
    首都青年工人代表、石景山钢铁公司青年高炉炉长刘惠章说，我们的切身经验告诉我们：美帝国主义是一切灾难痛苦的根源，狼总是要吃人的，只有打垮他们，彻底消灭他们，人民才有和平幸福的生活。我们相信，到处作恶的美帝国主义，最后灭亡的日子已经不远了。
    首都青年农民代表、北京市芦沟桥人民公社团委书记杜克文说，美帝国主义已经恶贯满盈了，不管它怎样挣扎，最后一定要死亡，一定要像苍蝇、臭虫、老鼠、蚊子一样被人民坚决、彻底、全部消灭掉。
    清华大学学生潘丽华在讲话中，代表首都青年学生向站在反帝爱国斗争最前列的土耳其青年学生致以崇高的敬意，表示坚决地、全力地支持他们的正义斗争。她说，土耳其青年学生的示威遭到美帝国主义豢养的曼德列斯反动派野蛮的血腥屠杀，是美国造的子弹夺去了青年的生命，是美制的坦克冲进学校的大门。但是，对人民的残酷镇压决不能挽救它死亡的命运，那里有帝国主义的统治，那里的人民就要起来反抗，帝国主义者的脚下到处是一触即发的火山。最后她要求一切被压迫民族，一切殖民地、半殖民地的同学们团结起来，在伟大光荣的反帝国主义斗争中充当最英勇、最积极的突击队，打倒帝国主义。
    大会上的讲话，受到人们热烈的欢迎，全场不断响起热烈的掌声，和震天动地的口号声。
    大会讲话结束以后，宣读了“中华人民共和国首都青年和各界人民支持土耳其人民爱国正义斗争大会通电”。
    宣读通电以后，首都两千名青年齐声高唱：“救亡进行曲”、“游击队之歌”、“我们一定要解放台湾”和“团结就是力量”等革命歌曲。两千人的歌声刚落，全场五万多人一致起立，接着齐声高唱“团结就是力量”。在雄壮的歌声中，一批彩色气球，腾空而起，气球带着“坚决支持土耳其人民的爱国正义斗争！”“支持一切被压迫民族的反帝爱国斗争！”
  “世界人民团结起来！打倒帝国主义！打倒殖民主义！”等巨幅标语。
    青年和学生们今天表现了极大的热情，有的从二十多里路以外赶来参加大会，有的编了活报剧、写了大字报和标语牌，沿途进行宣传。清华大学许多学生昨天晚上和今天早晨举行了座谈会。今天这个学校的学生和青年教师、职工们还专门召开了大会，通过了一份支持土耳其青年学生革命斗争的决议书。许多外国留学生也自愿参加了大会。一些来自土耳其的邻国——塞浦路斯、伊朗和伊拉克等国家的留学生，都非常关心土耳其局势的发展，表示坚决支持土耳其人民的革命。北京大学塞浦路斯的留学生佐波斯说，我们和土耳其是邻居，这个独裁统治的国家不是个好邻居，可是我们两国人民的关系是密切的，塞浦路斯有25％的人是土耳其族，我们反对美帝国主义把土耳其变成美国的军事基地，我们坚决支持土耳其人民的斗争。
    参加今天大会的还有政府各部门、各人民团体、各民主党派的负责人。他们当中有中国人民保卫世界和平委员会副主席廖承志，中华全国总工会主席刘宁一，共青团书记处书记罗毅、胡克实、王伟、杨海波，候补书记曾德林，全国青联副主席张超，全国学联主席胡启立，对外文化协会会长楚图南，中国民主促进会副主席王绍鏊，农工民主党中央主席团主席季方，中国致公党主席陈其尤，九三学社主席许德珩，台湾民主自治同盟秘书长徐萌山，北京市总工会主席王炯，共青团北京市委书记张进霖，北京高等学校的校长，和首都各方面的人士。
