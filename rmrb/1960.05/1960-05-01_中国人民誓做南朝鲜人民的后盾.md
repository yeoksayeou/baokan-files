　　Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 29th - Today, 100,000 people from all walks of life in Taiyuan City gathered for a rally and demonstration to support the South Korean people's patriotic and just struggle and to severely condemn the U.S. imperialists and their running dog, the Syngman Rhee reactionary clique, for their bloody massacre of the South Korean people.
　　Huang Zhigang, alternate secretary of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and head of the Shanxi Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, spoke at the meeting. He said that as long as the U.S. imperialists do not get out of South Korea, the South Korean people's suffering will not end. He pointed out that U.S. imperialism is not only the mortal enemy of the South Korean people but also the mortal enemy of the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and all peace-loving people. He concluded by saying: We believe that with the support of all justice-upholding and peace-loving people around the world, the South Korean people's patriotic and just struggle will surely be victorious. Heads of trade unions, women's federations, and the Communist Youth League, as well as representatives of workers, students, and urban people's communes, also spoke at the meeting. Finally, the congress unanimously passed a telegram supporting the South Korean people's patriotic and just struggle. A demonstration followed the meeting.
