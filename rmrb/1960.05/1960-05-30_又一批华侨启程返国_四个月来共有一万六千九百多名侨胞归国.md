Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 27th: The "Da Baokang," a ship sent by the Chinese government to Indonesia to transport overseas Chinese back to China, left Jakarta port today with a group of overseas Chinese.

The "Da Baokang" is making its fifth trip to transport overseas Chinese. Those returning to China on this voyage include overseas Chinese forcibly relocated from Cimahi in West Java, impoverished overseas Chinese from Bandung in West Java, and overseas Chinese from East Java and Central Java affected by Indonesian Presidential Decree No. 10, which prohibits foreign petty traders from operating in rural areas. About 200 of them are the first group of overseas Chinese from East Java to return on ships sent by the Chinese government.

Zhao Zhengyi, Counselor of the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia, Wu Zhizhi, the Chinese representative of the Sino-Indonesian Joint Committee for the Implementation of the Dual Nationality Treaty, consuls from the Chinese Consulate General in Jakarta, and staff members from the Chinese Embassy and Consulate General saw them off at the port of Jakarta.

Representatives from the Jakarta Chinese Association and 600 overseas Chinese also saw them off at the port.

As the ship set sail, the returning overseas Chinese gathered on the deck and shouted: "Let's meet in the motherland!", "Long live Chairman Mao!", "Long live the People's Republic of China!" The people seeing them off and the returning overseas Chinese sang songs of the motherland and waved to each other until the ship left the port. A banner given to the returning overseas Chinese to Surabaya by the Indonesian people hung on the side of the ship, reading "Long live the friendship between the Indonesian and Chinese people." Earlier, when the returning overseas Chinese were gathered in Jakarta waiting for the ship to return home, Ambassador Huang Zhen visited them at the reception center. Li Jusheng, the Chinese Consul General in Jakarta, held a reception to bid them farewell.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 28th: The "Fuan" ship, sent by the Chinese government, left Makassar on the morning of May 26th, carrying a group of overseas Chinese back to China. They are displaced overseas Chinese from South Sulawesi and Southeast Sulawesi who have been forcibly relocated and affected by Indonesian Presidential Decree No. 10, which prohibits foreign petty traders from operating in rural areas.

On May 21st, the Makassar branch of the Indonesia-China Friendship Association held a warm farewell party for this group of returning overseas Chinese. More than 1,000 people attended the farewell party. The displaced overseas Chinese and their Indonesian friends exchanged souvenirs at the meeting. The returning overseas Chinese presented a banner to the Makassar branch of the Indonesia-China Friendship Association. It read: "May the friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian people last forever." Sudiyo, Secretary-General of the Makassar branch of the Indonesia-China Friendship Association, said at the meeting that he hoped the friendship between the two peoples would continue to be strengthened.

From the end of January to the present, the Chinese government has sent a total of twenty-five ship voyages in five batches to Indonesia, transporting more than 16,900 displaced, unemployed, and fire-stricken overseas Chinese from nine provinces and cities in Indonesia back to China. Among them, more than 8,100 were displaced overseas Chinese who were forcibly relocated from West Java by the relevant Indonesian authorities. In addition, more than 14,700 overseas Chinese returned to their motherland on other ships during this period.

Many overseas Chinese affected by Indonesian Presidential Decree No. 10 are continuing to go through procedures for returning to China in various places. As forced relocation continues in some parts of West Java, as the Riau Islands authorities prematurely revoke the business licenses of foreign petty traders, and as foreigners are prohibited from engaging in small-scale handicrafts and industries, the number of displaced overseas Chinese is still increasing. They have been constantly requesting the Indonesian government to quickly send ships to repatriate them back to China, to simplify the procedures for overseas Chinese to return to China, to reduce and exempt taxes, and to allow them to bring back a small amount of funds so that they can end their miserable lives in Indonesia as soon as possible.

    又一批华侨启程返国
    四个月来共有一万六千九百多名侨胞归国
    新华社雅加达27日电　中国政府派来印度尼西亚接运华侨回国的轮船“大宝康号”今天载着一批华侨离开雅加达港。
    “大宝康号”已经是第五次来接运华侨。这次搭乘“大宝康号”回国的有从西爪哇的芝马墟被迫迁出的华侨、西爪哇万隆的贫苦华侨以及受到禁止外国小商贩在乡村地区营业的印度尼西亚第十号总统法令影响的东爪哇和中爪哇的华侨，其中约二百人是东爪哇华侨中第一批乘中国政府派遣的船回国的。
    在雅加达港口送行的有中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆参赞赵政一、为实施双重国籍问题条约的中国—印度尼西亚联合委员会的中国代表伍治之、中国驻雅加达总领事馆领事以及中国大使馆和总领事馆的工作人员。
    在港口送行的还有雅加达中华侨团总会的代表和华侨六百人。
    当轮船启碇时，归国华侨聚集在甲板上高呼：“让我们在祖国见面！”、“毛主席万岁！”、“中华人民共和国万岁！”送行的人和归国华侨唱着祖国的歌曲，互相招手，直到船开出港口为止。印度尼西亚人民送给泗水归国华侨的一幅横幅挂在船的一旁，上面写着“印度尼西亚人民和中国人民的友谊万岁”。早些时候，当归国华侨在雅加达集中等候船只回国的时候，黄镇大使曾到招待所访问了他们。中国驻雅加达总领事李菊生曾举行招待会欢送他们。
    新华社雅加达28日电　中国政府派遣的“福安号”轮船5月26日上午载运一批华侨离开望加锡回国。他们是在南苏拉威西和东南苏拉威西这两地区遭到迫迁和受到禁止外国小商贩在乡村地区营业的印度尼西亚第十号总统法令影响的流离失所的华侨。
    5月21日，印度尼西亚—中国友好协会望加锡分会为这批归国华侨举行了热烈的欢送会。出席欢送会的有一千多人。流离失所的华侨和他们的印度尼西亚朋友在会上互换了纪念品。即将归国的华侨赠送给印度尼西亚—中国友好协会望加锡分会一面锦旗。上面写着：“愿中国和印度尼西亚两国人民的友谊常青”。印度尼西亚—中国友好协会望加锡分会秘书长苏迪约在会上说，他希望两国人民的友谊将不断得到加强。
    从1月底到现在，中国政府已经分五批共派遣二十五艘次船只去印度尼西亚，把一万六千九百多名流离失所、丧失生计和遭遇火灾的华侨从印度尼西亚的九个省市接运回国。其中，有八千一百多人是被印度尼西亚有关当局迫迁离开西爪哇的流离失所的华侨。除此之外，在这期间乘其它船只返回祖国的华侨也有一万四千七百多人。
    受到印度尼西亚第十号总统法令影响的许多华侨目前继续在各地办理回国手续。由于迫迁仍旧在西爪哇的一些地方继续着，由于廖内岛当局提前收回外国小商贩的营业执照，由于禁止外国人经营小规模的手工业和工业，因此流离失所的华侨人数还在增加。他们一直在纷纷要求印度尼西亚政府迅速派遣船只遣送他们返回中国，要求简化华侨回国手续，减低和免除捐税，准许他们带回少量资金，以便使他们能够尽早结束在印度尼西亚的悲惨生活。
