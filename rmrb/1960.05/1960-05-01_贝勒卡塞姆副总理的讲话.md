Xinhua News Agency, 30th. Speech by Krim Belkacem, head of the delegation of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, at the capital airport.
    Your Excellency Deputy Prime Minister, dear friends:
    We have come to the territory of the People's Republic of China with pleasure and honor. Our two countries are far apart, but this is only a geographical distance. In fact, our two countries are very close. The common struggle against colonialism and reactionary forces of imperialism, the common demand for peace on the basis of independence and progress, and the sincere desire for cooperation on the basis of mutual respect all closely link our two countries and forge a strong friendship.
    On behalf of the delegation, I would like to thank the government of the People's Republic of China for the invitation. This gives us the opportunity to bring the respect of the fighting Algeria to the People's Republic of China, its people and its government.
    The war that our country is stubbornly waging is about to be six years old. The Algerian people, with their inferior equipment, are resisting the French colonial army supported by the Atlantic Group, especially the rulers of the United States.
    Colonialist bandits are frantically massacring civilians, women, the elderly and children.
    However, the Algerian people, who have sacrificed hundreds of thousands of their sons and daughters, are mobilizing all their forces to deal with the colonialists' attempt to reconquer Algeria. Our cause is just, and our people's determination is stronger than ever. We will continue to fight until we achieve national independence.
    In this struggle for liberation, the Algerian people are supported by the fraternal Arab people and all freedom-loving and progressive people.
    Our people also know that the great and heroic Chinese people are on our side.
    Our people will not forget that the People's Republic of China was one of the first countries to recognize the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria.
    We are paying close attention to the construction of New China under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and other leaders. Before us, three official delegations from our government had the honor of being received by this friendly country and witnessed the great achievements of the Chinese revolution.
    We are proud to accept the friendly invitation of the government of the People's Republic of China once again. We believe that this visit will further consolidate the friendly relations between our two peoples and strengthen our unity in the struggle against colonialism and imperialism.
    Once again, on behalf of the Algerian people and the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, I express my respect to the great and friendly Chinese people and the government of the People's Republic of China.
    Please allow me, on behalf of the delegation, to thank you for your warm welcome, which is also a welcome to the Algerian people who are fighting for independence through our delegation.
    Long live the friendship between the Algerian and Chinese peoples!
    Long live the struggle of the people of all countries for independence!
    Long live world peace!

    贝勒卡塞姆副总理的讲话
    新华社30日讯　阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团团长副总理兼外交部长克里姆·贝勒卡塞姆在首都机场上的讲话。副总理阁下：亲爱的朋友们：
    我们怀着愉快和荣幸的心情来到了中华人民共和国的国土。我们两国相距很远，但这只是地理上的距离。事实上我们两国是很接近的。反对殖民主义和帝国主义反动势力的共同斗争，在独立和进步基础上争取和平的共同要求，在相互尊重基础上进行合作的真诚愿望，这一切把我们两国紧密地联系在一起，结成了牢固的友谊。
    我谨以代表团的名义对中华人民共和国政府的邀请表示感谢。这使我们有机会把战斗的阿尔及利亚的敬意带给中华人民共和国，它的人民和它的政府。
    我国顽强地进行着的战争即将六年。阿尔及利亚人民以他们劣势的装备，抗击着由大西洋集团特别是美国统治者所支持的法国殖民军队。
    殖民主义强盗们疯狂地屠杀平民、妇女、老人和儿童。
    但是，已经牺牲了数十万儿女的阿尔及利亚人民，正在动员一切力量来对付殖民者重新征服阿尔及利亚的企图。我们的事业是正义的，我国人民的决心比过去任何时候更加坚定，我们将继续战斗，直至获得民族独立。
    在这场争取解放的斗争中，阿尔及利亚人民得到兄弟的阿拉伯人民和所有爱好自由和进步人民的支持。
    我国人民也知道，伟大的英勇的中国人民是站在我们这边的。
    我国人民不会忘记，中华人民共和国是首先承认阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府的国家之一。
    我们十分关切地注视着新中国在毛泽东主席及其他领导人的英明领导下所进行的建设。在我们之前，我国政府已有三个官方代表团荣幸地受到了这个友好国家的接待，并且看到了中国革命的伟大成就。
    我们怀着骄傲的心情，再一次接受了中华人民共和国政府的友好邀请。我们相信，这次访问将进一步巩固我们两国人民的友好关系，并将加强我们在反对殖民主义和帝国主义斗争中的团结。
    我再一次向伟大的友好的中国人民和中华人民共和国政府，表示阿尔及利亚人民和阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府的敬意。
    请允许我以代表团的名义感谢你们的热烈欢迎，这也是通过我们代表团向正在为独立而斗争的阿尔及利亚人民所表示的欢迎。
    阿尔及利亚中国两国人民之间的友好万岁！
    各国人民争取独立的斗争万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
