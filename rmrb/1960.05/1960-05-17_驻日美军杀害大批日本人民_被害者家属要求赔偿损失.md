Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 16th: The "National Association of Victims of the US Occupation Forces," composed of more than two thousand family members of innocent people killed by the US military in Japan, is demanding that the Diet enact a law providing compensation to the families of those killed by the US military.

Eighty representatives of this group submitted a petition to Ichiro Kiyose, Speaker of the House of Representatives of the Japanese Diet, on the 12th, putting forward these demands.

According to the "Akahata" newspaper, from August 1945 to April 1952, when the "San Francisco Peace Treaty" came into effect, ten thousand Japanese people were killed by the US military, and there were many more cases that were not reported. At that time, the Japanese government only paid so-called compensation of 10,000 to 70,000 yen per victim. Furthermore, when the "San Francisco Peace Treaty" was signed, the Japanese government also gave up the right to demand compensation from the US government.

Kawahara Hanshiro, Vice-Chairman of the "National Association of Victims of the US Occupation Forces," stated in an interview published in the "Akahata" newspaper that the Japanese government should compensate the victims rather than rush to ratify the new "Security Treaty."

One representative of this group pointed out that because Japan concluded the "San Francisco Peace Treaty" with the United States, we have fallen into such a tragic state as it is now, and we also have deep doubts about the conclusion of the new "Security Treaty."

    驻日美军杀害大批日本人民
    被害者家属要求赔偿损失
    新华社16日讯　东京消息：由被美军杀害的无辜者的家属二千多人组成的“日本全国驻留军受害者联合会”要求国会制订法律，规定给予被美军杀害者的家属以赔偿。
    这个团体的代表八十人，12日交给日本国会众议院议长清濑一郎一份请愿书，提出了这些要求。
    据“赤旗报”报道，从1945年8月起到1952年4月“旧金山和约”生效这一期间，被美军杀害的日本人民有一万人，还有很多没有提出报告的。当时日本政府只对牺牲者支付每人一万到七万日元的所谓赔偿。而且在签订“旧金山和约”时，日本政府还放弃了对美国政府要求赔偿的权利。
    “日本全国驻留军受害者联合会”副会长川浦半四郎在“赤旗报”上发表谈话指出，日本政府与其急于批准新“安全条约”，不如对受害者给与赔偿。
    这个团体的一位代表指出，由于日本同美国缔结“旧金山和约”，我们陷进了像目前这样悲惨的状态，我们对缔结新“安全条约”也有很深的疑问。
