Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, May 20th: Cambodian National Radio broadcast on the evening of the 19th a lengthy speech delivered by Prince Sihanouk on the 18th in Kampong Cham Province. In the speech, he condemned the United States and its lackeys for their hostility and threats towards Cambodia.

In his speech, Sihanouk pointed out that recently, approximately two hundred "Free Khmer Movement" members from South Vietnam entered Kratie Province and engaged in provocative propaganda. Last week, a large quantity of weapons was transported to Aranyaprathet on the Thai border, awaiting transport into Battambang Province in Cambodia for use in rebellion. Sihanouk pointed out that Son Ngoc Thanh had said that Cambodia, surrounded by Thailand, South Vietnam, and Laos, led by Phoumi Nosavan, these "free countries," would inevitably be eliminated.

Sihanouk said that Cambodia is not isolated and without friends in resisting aggression. He said that Chinese leaders, during their visit to Cambodia, expressed their support for the Cambodian people's struggle to defend national independence. Sihanouk added, "We are friends with China not because we believe in communism. We make friends because others treat us as enemies. The free world treats us as enemies, Thailand, South Vietnam, and Phoumi Nosavan treat us as enemies. In this situation, do we choose life or death?" He continued, "If Western countries treat us as enemies, how can we treat Eastern countries that have never invaded us as enemies? This is impossible."

Sihanouk said that in reality, the "free world" group is declining and losing face, and it is suffering defeats everywhere. The future of the communist world is brighter than Cambodia's. Cambodia has friends in the communist world, and it will become strong in the future. This is very realistic. Sihanouk said, now that the United States' lackeys are holding Cambodia by the neck, how can Cambodia be friends with the United States?

Sihanouk pointed out that in the event of an invasion of Cambodia, the most important issue is how to arm the Cambodian people. He said that all Cambodian people must learn to use weapons and other military knowledge in order to fight the invaders.

    西哈努克亲王发表讲话
    斥美国及其仆从威胁柬埔寨
    新华社金边20日电　柬埔寨国家电台19日晚上广播了西哈努克亲王18日在磅湛省发表的长篇讲话，讲话中谴责美国和它的仆从敌视和威胁柬埔寨。
    西哈努克在讲话中指出，最近大约有两百多名来自南越的“自由高棉运动”分子进入桔井省，并进行挑衅宣传。上星期，有大量武器被运到泰国的边境阿兰尼亚普拉特，等待运入柬埔寨的马德望省以供叛乱活动之用。西哈努克指出，山玉成曾说，柬埔寨受到泰国、南越和以富米·诺萨万为首的老挝这些“自由国家”的包围，必将遭到消灭。
    西哈努克说，柬埔寨在抵抗侵略的时候并不是孤立的和没有朋友的，他说，中国领袖们在访问柬埔寨时表示将支持柬埔寨人民保卫民族独立而进行的斗争。西哈努克又说，“我们同中国交朋友并不是因为我们信奉共产主义。我们交朋友是因为别人把我们当作敌人。自由世界把我们当作敌人，泰国、南越和富米·诺萨万把我们当作敌人。在这种情况下，我们选择生路呢还是选择死路？”他又说，“如果西方国家把我们当作敌人，我们怎能把从来没有侵犯过我们的东方国家当作敌人呢。这是不可能的。”
    西哈努克说，实际上，“自由世界”集团正在走下坡路，并失掉了面子，它还到处遭到失败。共产主义世界的前途比柬埔寨的光明。柬埔寨有共产主义世界的朋友，它在将来将会强大起来。这是很现实的。西哈努克说，现在正当美国的仆从者捏着柬埔寨的脖子的时候，柬埔寨怎能和美国做朋友呢。
    西哈努克指出，柬埔寨万一受到侵略时，最重要的问题是如何武装柬埔寨人民。他说，所有柬埔寨人民都必须学习运用武器和其它军事知识以便打击侵略者。
