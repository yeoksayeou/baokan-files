    On the Summer Harvesting Front

    Wenzhou Prefecture’s Spring Crops Ripen
    Harvesting Area Exceeds Half

    (Reported by our newspaper) In the Wenzhou area of Zhejiang, rapeseed, wheat, broad beans, and other spring crops are generally ripening. As of May 8th, the district had harvested 1.32 million mu of rapeseed, wheat, broad beans, and other crops, accounting for 55% of the total spring crop area.

    During the harvest, most areas have managed to gather everything cleanly, leaving nothing behind. A few areas where the initial harvest was not thorough immediately organized a second sweep to ensure every grain is brought in.

    Wusheng County Achieves Bumper Summer Grain Harvest, with Rapeseed Peak Yields Exceeding 1,000 Jin Per Mu

    (Reported by our newspaper) By the end of April, Wusheng County in Sichuan Province had completed harvesting over 160,000 mu of rapeseed, broad beans, peas, and barley. As of May 5th, the county had also harvested 95% of its 160,000 mu of wheat; rapeseed and barley have been completely harvested and threshed; over 80% of peas and broad beans have been threshed; and over 50% of the wheat has been threshed, all with meticulous harvesting and threshing to ensure every grain is stored. As early as May 3rd, the county had already overfulfilled its state purchase quota for rapeseed.

    This year, Wusheng County's spring crops have had another bumper harvest. The First Management Area of the Jiuxian Commune had 17 mu of wheat with an average yield of 996.6 jin per mu, with two mu yielding as much as 1,345 jin, more than doubling the yield from last year. The two mu of rapeseed cultivated by the Liemian District Committee achieved an average yield of 1,002 jin per mu, and two mu of peas yielded 1,032 jin per mu, setting the district's highest-ever yields for rapeseed and peas.

    Currently, the entire county is filled with joy, with everyone smiling and eager to share the good news of the bumper harvest.

    Xinhua County's Rapeseed All in Storage

    (Telegram from the Xinhua County Committee) As of May 7th, Xinhua County in Hunan Province had completely harvested, threshed, and stored all of its 51,000+ mu of rapeseed; and basically completed the harvesting and threshing of its 66,000+ mu of barley. The Xiaoyang Brigade of the Shengli Commune verified an average yield of 212 jin per mu for its 371 mu of rapeseed; and the Ninth Production Team of the Zhongxin Brigade of the Youjia Commune reported an average yield of 226 jin per mu for its 40 mu of barley.

    To combat the rainy weather, communes across the county prepared over 18,000 empty rooms and over 28,000 drying baskets for baking. Over 330,000 jin of barley that was rushed to harvest before the rain by the Shengli Commune has been completely spread out to dry, ensuring every grain is stored.

    Fengting and Majia Communes Double Wheat and Barley Production

    (Reported by our newspaper) Fengting Commune in Xianyou County and Majia Commune in Jinjiang County, Fujian Province, have doubled their wheat and barley production. Fengting Commune planted over 14,000 mu of wheat and barley, all of which has been harvested.

By early May, 80% of the early-harvested rapeseed in the county had been completely threshed and stored. This year, the county has focused on "speed" in its harvesting and threshing efforts. As soon as the rapeseed harvest was completed, the county organized an 80,000-strong threshing and drying team to rush to thresh and dry, ensuring that the harvest is threshed and dried and stored the same day.
