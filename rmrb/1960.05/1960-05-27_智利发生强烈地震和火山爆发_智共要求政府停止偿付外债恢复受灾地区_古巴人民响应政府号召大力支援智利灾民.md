    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：智利发生了强烈的地震，南部的一系列火山也爆发。
    这几次地震的强度超过了智利过去的历次地震，使智利处于历来最大的自然灾难中。
    根据已获得的资料，21日和22日的两次地震共有一百二十次震动，波及的地区达十五万平方公里。包括圣地亚哥以南的利纳雷斯、马乌莱、比奥比奥、公塞普森等十二个省。这个地区的居民占智利全国人口的三分之一。他们当中最少有65％的人无家可归，三百人死亡，二百人失踪，一千人受重伤。
    智利南部一系列火山发生了爆发，在里尼乌埃湖附近出现了两个新火山。24日，奥索尔诺等七座火山都在喷射岩浆。附近的居民已开始迁移。
    25日的地震一共震动了四次，其中一次最强，产生了巨大的破坏力。据智利政府内政部宣布，这一天有三百七十多人死亡，八百多人失踪，无家可归的达四十万人。
    在瓦尔的维亚附近的山中，由于地震而出现了两个新的湖泊。
    25日的地震引起的巨大海啸侵袭着智利南部海岸。海浪高达四点五米。济罗岛附近的一个小岛上的一百五十个居民已经全部失踪。
    据称，由于连日来的地震，智利的地形已经完全改观。
    据智利财政部宣称，自从21日开始发生地震以来，财产的损失至少已达三亿美元。
    智利25日发生新地震而引起的海啸，继续侵袭新西兰、日本、菲律宾、美国等国的海岸。以日本受到的损害最严重。据不完全统计，已有八百人死亡，十五万人无家可归。海岸交通遭到了巨大的损坏。夏威夷受到海啸的侵袭时，三十多人死亡，二百人受伤，二十多人失踪。

    同时，智利共产党政治委员会号召支持智利工人统一工会关于捐献半天工资来援助地震受害者的决议。
    据新华社哈瓦那电　古巴革命政府23日晚上向各国政府和人民，特别是拉丁美洲各国政府和人民发出紧急呼吁，倡议立即援助最近遭受巨大地震灾害的智利人民。这个呼吁是卡斯特罗总理在由外交部举行的记者招待会上发出的。
    古巴人民响应古巴政府的紧急号召，正积极动员起来援助遭受地震灾害的智利人民。
