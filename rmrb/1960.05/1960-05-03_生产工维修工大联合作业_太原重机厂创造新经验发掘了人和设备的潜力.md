Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan Electric Dispatch The Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant promotes the joint operation of production workers, maintenance workers, and auxiliary workers, greatly tapping the potential of people and equipment, and effectively promoting the improvement of production technology.

Since the beginning of this year, with the continuous improvement of the factory's mechanization and automation, new and higher requirements have been put forward for equipment maintenance and repair. Labor organization needs to be adjusted reasonably in a timely manner, and production management must catch up. In order to solve this contradiction, the workers of the hydraulic press workshop of this machinery factory, on the basis of a reasonable division of labor, organized production workers, maintenance workers, and auxiliary workers to implement large-scale collaboration. After the factory party committee discovered this experience, it attached great importance to it and quickly promoted this advanced experience throughout the factory, effectively promoting the improvement of workers' technical level and labor productivity. According to statistics from the forging, first metalworking, hydraulic press, and cast steel workshops alone, 206 workers were saved.

Practice has proved that large-scale joint operations have the following four major benefits: First, it effectively strengthens equipment maintenance, reduces equipment accidents, and improves equipment utilization. After the implementation of joint operations, maintenance workers participated in production, and production workers participated in equipment maintenance, which enabled everyone to further familiarize themselves with the performance and structure of the equipment, and further care for the equipment's maintenance. Therefore, major repairs became minor repairs, and complete repairs became component repairs, shortening the repair time and improving the quality of repairs. Second, the labor organization was rationally adjusted, which greatly saved labor. After the implementation of joint operations, labor can be uniformly allocated, and the "multi-skilled" movement of "being proficient in one skill and capable in many" has been promoted, improving workers' technical level and overcoming the uneven phenomenon of production workers being busy, maintenance workers being idle during peacetime, and maintenance workers being busy and production workers being idle once equipment fails, solving the difficulty of labor shortage. Third, it vigorously promoted the development of mechanization, automation, and comprehensive technical innovation. After the implementation of joint operations, production workers and maintenance workers became more familiar with the performance, structure, and operation of the equipment, which opened up ideas for improving equipment and realizing mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation. At the same time, because equipment accidents were greatly reduced and production proceeded smoothly, production workers and maintenance workers were able to free up more time and energy to engage in technical transformation. Fourth, it further strengthened the unity between workers and the cooperation between different types of work. After the implementation of joint operations, the complaints between some production workers and maintenance workers disappeared, and the buck-passing between various types of work was completely resolved. They worked together to improve production. The Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has promoted this advanced experience.

    生产工维修工大联合作业
    太原重机厂创造新经验发掘了人和设备的潜力
    据新华社太原电　太原重型机器厂推行生产工人、维修工人、辅助工人的大联合作业，大大发掘了人和设备的潜力，有效地促进了生产技术水平的提高。
    今年以来，随着工厂机械化、自动化程度的不断提高，对设备维护检修提出了新的更高的要求，劳动组织需要及时作合理的调整，生产管理也必须迎头赶上。这个机器厂水压机车间职工为了解决这个矛盾，在合理分工的基础上，组织生产工人、维修工人、辅助工人实行大协作。厂党委发现这个经验后，十分重视，迅速在全厂推行这项先进经验，有效地促进了工人技术水平和劳动生产率的提高。仅据锻压、一金工、水压机、铸钢四个车间统计，就节省劳动力二百零六人。
    实践证明，大联合作业有以下四大好处：首先是有效地加强了设备的维修保养，减少了设备事故，提高了设备利用率。实行联合作业以后，检修工参加生产，生产工参加设备维修，使大家进一步熟悉了设备的性能和结构，进一步关心对设备的爱护和保养，因而做到了化大修为小修，化整修为零修，缩短了检修时间，提高了检修质量。第二、合理地调整了劳动组织，大大节约了劳动力。实行联合作业以后，劳动力可以统一调配，并促进了“精一兼数”的“多面手”运动，提高了工人的技术水平，克服了过去平时生产工人紧张、检修工人空闲和一旦设备发生故障，检修工人紧张、生产工人窝工的忙闲不均现象，解决了劳动力不足的困难。第三、有力地推动了机械化、自动化和全面技术革新的开展。实行联合作业以后，生产工人和检修工人进一步熟悉了设备的性能、结构和运转情况，为改进设备，实现机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化打开了思路。同时，由于设备事故大大减少，生产顺利进行，还使生产工人和检修工人有可能抽出更多时间和精力来从事技术改造。第四、进一步密切了工人之间的团结和工种之间的协作。实行联合作业以后，有些生产工人和检修工人互相埋怨的情绪没有了，各工种之间的扯皮现象彻底解决了，他们同心协力，搞好生产。中共太原市委已推广了这项先进经验。
