    Japanese Friends Talk About the Patriotic Struggle of the Japanese People
    Editor's Note: The articles published here were written by Japanese friends who recently visited our country. Many articles introduce the basic situation of the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle. This will help our readers deepen their understanding of the Japanese people's struggle. Due to space limitations, only abstracts of these articles are published here. Several other articles will be published successively.
    The Consolidated Foundation of the Anti-American Patriotic Struggle
    Ōno Takeo, Chairman of the "Kochi Prefecture Joint Struggle Conference to Prevent Revision of the 'Security Treaty'"
    In October 1953, Ikeda Hayato, then a special envoy of the Japanese Prime Minister, and US Assistant Secretary of State Robertson held talks in Washington. During this meeting, the United States made very specific provisions for the revival of Japanese militarism, including militaristic education for young people. From that time on, Japanese education began to be led astray. The broad masses of Japanese teachers, recognizing the conspiracy of US imperialism, united to fight back. They encountered difficulties and suffered injuries and bloodshed in their struggle against the revival of militaristic education, but they continued to fight.
    After the first unified action against the revision of the US-Japan "Security Treaty," Kochi Prefecture launched a high tide of anti-American patriotic struggle. Even when there were no unified actions, the teachers of Kochi Prefecture continuously struggled in conjunction with the opposition to the "Performance Evaluation System." This March, teachers who actively opposed the "Performance Evaluation System" were transferred by the authorities to schools in the mountains. However, these transferred teachers continued to organize struggles, using the mountain schools as their base. The anti-American patriotic struggle of the people of Kochi Prefecture has been developing more and more deeply in this way, combined with concrete struggles around them. Because of this solid foundation, Kochi Prefecture was able to take the lead among various places in Japan in mobilizing one-half of the people of the entire prefecture to hold a peaceful march.

    日本友人谈日本人民的爱国斗争
    编者按：这里发表的几篇文章，都是最近刚刚访问过我国的日本朋友们撰写的。不少文章介绍了日本人民爱国正义斗争的基本情况。这有助于我国读者加深对日本人民斗争的了解。因为篇幅所限，这里发表的只是这些文章的摘要。还有几篇文章，将陆续发表。
    反美爱国斗争的巩固基础
    “高知县阻止修改‘安全条约’共同斗争会议”议长　大野武夫
    1953年10月，当时的日本首相特使池田勇人和美国助理国务卿罗伯逊在华盛顿举行了会谈。在这次会谈中美国对于复活日本军国主义作了非常具体的规定，其中包括对青少年进行军国主义教育。从那个时候起，日本的教育就开始被拖上歪路。认清了美帝国主义阴谋的广大日本教职员，一致起来反击。他们在反对复活军国主义教育的斗争中屡次遭到困难，他们负过伤，流过血，但是仍然继续进行斗争。
    在反对修改日美“安全条约”的第一次统一行动以后，高知县就掀起了反美爱国斗争的高潮。即使没有统一行动的时候，高知县的教员们也结合反对“勤务评定制度”不断地进行斗争。今年3月，积极反对“勤务评定制度”的教员被当局调到山里的学校去。但是，被调走的这些教员，以山里的学校为据点继续组织斗争。高知县人民的反美爱国斗争，就是这样同身边的具体斗争结合起来日益深入发展的。因为有了这样巩固的基础，所以高知县能够在最近日本各个地方当中率先动员全县人民的二分之一举行和平大游行。
