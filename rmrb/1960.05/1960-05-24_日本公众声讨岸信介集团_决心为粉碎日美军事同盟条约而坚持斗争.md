Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Japanese mass organizations continue to issue statements and pass resolutions, strongly condemning the Kishi Nobusuke group's criminal act of forcibly passing the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty illegally through violent means, and expressing their determination to fight resolutely to the end to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke traitorous government, dissolve the Diet, and smash this traitorous and aggressive treaty.

    The Japan Peace Committee issued a statement on the 21st, declaring the new "Security Treaty" forcibly "passed" by the Kishi Nobusuke group in the Lower House invalid, and demanding the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and the immediate dissolution of the Diet.

    The statement called on the Japanese people to hold rallies in various places to declare the new "Security Treaty" invalid, and to protest to the Diet, the Kishi Nobusuke government, and the U.S. Embassy in Japan. The statement also called on the people to launch a movement against Eisenhower's visit to Japan.

    The statement emphasized that the Japanese people's historically significant struggle against the new "Security Treaty" is expanding and strengthening daily, and that this struggle is closely related to the Asian people's struggle for national independence and unity, and has made a great contribution to the Asian people's common struggle against U.S. imperialism's rule.

    The statement emphasized the importance of strengthening the unity between the Japanese people and the Asian people, headed by the Chinese people.

    The statement emphasized that all Japanese people must strengthen their unity, resolutely launch a struggle, and pursue the traitorous and reactionary forces until final victory is achieved.

    The Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs issued a statement on the 22nd, saying that the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs does not recognize that the treaty has been "passed," because the treaty was "passed" only by some Liberal Democratic Party members with the help of police forces. The statement also demanded the immediate dissolution of the Diet, and expressed its determination to closely unite with the Asian people who oppose the establishment of foreign bases on the territory of Asian countries and fight to the final victory.

    The Japan Women's Association for the Defense of Human Rights, composed of more than 50 Japanese women's organizations, issued a statement on the 23rd, strongly protesting Kishi Nobusuke's fascist atrocities in the Diet and demanding the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet.

    The statement pointed out that the House of Representatives' vote on the new "Security Treaty" was completely invalid. The statement said that the news of Kishi Nobusuke's atrocities of trampling on democracy in the Diet has made our women very indignant. The statement demanded that the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet resign immediately and dissolve the Diet. And said that they will do their best to fight to the end to achieve this goal.

    The Japan Literary Artists Association's Freedom of Speech Committee issued a statement on the evening of May 20, saying that it is very clear that after the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" is "passed" in the House of Representatives with the help of police forces, this treaty will become a threat to freedom of expression and speech. This is the first time that the Japan Literary Artists Association has expressed its opinion on the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."
