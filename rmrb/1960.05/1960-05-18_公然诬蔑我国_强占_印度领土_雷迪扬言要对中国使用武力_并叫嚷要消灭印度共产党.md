Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 16th - According to the Indian Press Trust, Indian National Congress President Reddi, speaking at a public gathering in Calcutta on the 15th, slandered China for "seizing" Indian territory and threatened to use force against China.

Reddi stated that all peaceful means must be explored to resolve the Sino-Indian border issue. However, targeting China, he said that India must not forget that there was "aggression" on its land. He also said, "We may have to use force" to "recover the areas occupied by the Chinese."

According to "The Statesman," Reddi expressed "shock" in his speech that the Indian Communist Party candidate defeated the National Congress candidate in the by-election for the Indian People's Assembly in the Calcutta constituency and threatened to "eliminate the Indian Communist Party."
