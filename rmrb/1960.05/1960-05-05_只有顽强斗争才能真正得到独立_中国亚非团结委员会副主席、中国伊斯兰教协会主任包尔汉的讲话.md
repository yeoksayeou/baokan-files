Chairman, Comrades, Friends:

　　May 4th is a glorious festival for Chinese youth and the Chinese people, and also a great day for patriotism and anti-imperialism. As the flames of anger burn in South Korea and Japan, a patriotic and just struggle has also unfolded in Turkey. On behalf of the Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee and the China Islamic Association, I express my firm support and heartfelt respect to the brave Turkish youth and people.

　　Recently, the struggle against imperialism and colonialism in Asia, Africa, and Latin America has continuously reached new heights. This historical torrent cannot be stopped by imperialism and reactionary forces, nor can it be restrained by anyone. Comrades, we can also clearly see this excellent situation from the successful outcome of the recent Second Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference.

　　The Second Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference, held in Conakry, the capital of Guinea, from April 11th to 15th, was a grand gathering of unity against imperialism by the people of Asia and Africa. More than 300 representatives from over 60 Asian and African countries attended the conference. In particular, representatives from the non-independent regions of Africa participated in the meeting with unprecedented enthusiasm, and their anti-imperialist sentiment was very high. The more than 30 documents unanimously adopted by the conference were all permeated with a strong anti-imperialist spirit. The resolution explicitly declared that the existence of imperialism is incompatible with the current state of the world. The resolution called on the people of Asia and Africa to strengthen their unity and completely eradicate imperialism and colonialism. The conference announced that the struggle against imperialism is an inseparable and important part of the movement to defend world peace, and that there can be no genuine peaceful coexistence as long as imperialism exists. This is the common aspiration and fighting cry of the people of Asia and Africa. The Chinese people, who have always resolutely opposed imperialism and supported the national liberation movements of Asia and Africa, wholeheartedly support all the resolutions of the conference and warmly congratulate the great success of the conference. We would especially like to pay our highest respects to our African brothers who are fighting heroically.

　　Comrades, the Second Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference made it even clearer that American imperialism is the common and most vicious enemy of the people of Asian and African countries. Many representatives used a large number of facts in their speeches to sternly condemn and expose the various crimes committed by American imperialism in carrying out aggressive activities everywhere. They believe that the United States' intrusion into Africa in terms of politics, military affairs, economy, culture, and ideology is a typical manifestation of neo-colonialism. The conference passed a resolution supporting the Korean people, demanding that American troops withdraw from South Korea, and realizing peaceful reunification; and passed a resolution supporting the Japanese people, resolutely condemning the collusion between American imperialism and the Kishi Nobusuke group in Japan to sign a new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." It also specifically passed a resolution against the expansion of military bases and the formation of military blocs by imperialism headed by the United States in Asia and Africa. This is also a direct support for the patriotic and just struggle of the Turkish people. This clearly shows that the people of Asia and Africa stand firmly with the people of South Korea, Japan, and Turkey. At the same time, it further proves that the resolutions of the Conakry Conference are completely correct. We firmly believe that with the support of the powerful people of Asia and Africa and the people of the world, the struggle of the people of South Korea, Japan, and Turkey will surely achieve final victory.

　　The fighting atmosphere of the vigorous national liberation movement in Africa always filled the conference hall. The representatives of heroic Algeria received a particularly warm welcome from the conference. The conference's affirmation of Algeria's armed anti-imperialist struggle is a serious blow to those who advocate so-called non-violent resistance to imperialism among the people. Many representatives pointed out that the people of Asia and Africa love peace, but they are also the most valiant and skilled fighters in resisting the violent rule of imperialism. If American imperialism does not get out of Asia, Africa, and Latin America soon, the people will surely rise up and drive out all the American robbers!

　　Comrades, this Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference also emphasized calling on the people of Asia and Africa to be vigilant against the new conspiracies of imperialism and to abandon any illusions about imperialism. Only by relying on resolute struggle and self-reliance can we truly obtain and consolidate independence and peace. When the head of our delegation mentioned in his speech at the conference that "the experience of the Chinese people's years of struggle proves that in the struggle against imperialism, as long as the people are determined and persist in heroic struggle, they are invincible," he received warm applause from all the representatives.

　　The Chinese delegation received a universal, warm, and friendly welcome from the representatives of African countries. The imperialist elements' conspiracy to sabotage the conference and sow discord between China and Africa was completely shattered. The Chinese delegation fulfilled the entrustment of the Chinese people, held high the banner of opposing imperialism and colonialism, and made its due contribution to the success of the conference together with representatives from various countries. We also express our heartfelt gratitude to the African representatives for their support for restoring our country's legitimate seat in the United Nations, liberating Taiwan, and opposing the US imperialist conspiracy to create "two Chinas"! Let the people of Asia and Africa unite more closely, support each other, and advance victoriously. Let us work together to thoroughly implement the various resolutions of the Second Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference.

　　The Patriotic and Just Struggle of the Turkish People Will Surely Be Victorious!
　　Down with Imperialism and Colonialism!
　　Long Live the Great Unity of the People of the World!

    只有顽强斗争才能真正得到独立
    中国亚非团结委员会副主席、中国伊斯兰教协会主任包尔汉的讲话主席，同志们，朋友们：
    5月4日，是中国青年和中国人民的光荣节日，也是爱国反帝的伟大日子。随着南朝鲜和日本人民的怒火燃烧，爱国正义斗争又在土耳其展开了。我代表中国亚非团结委员会和中国伊斯兰教协会，向勇敢的土耳其青年和人民表示坚决的支持和衷心的敬意。
    最近以来，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲反对帝国主义、殖民主义的斗争，不断出现新高涨。这个历史巨流，是帝国主义和反动势力所阻挡不住的，也是任何人所约束不了的。同志们，我们从最近举行的第二届亚非人民团结大会的圆满结果，也可以清楚地看出这个大好形势来。
    4月11日到15日，在几内亚首都科纳克里举行的第二届亚非人民团结大会，是一次亚非人民反帝大团结的盛会。参加这次大会的有亚非六十多个国家的三百多名代表。特别是非洲未独立地区的代表，参加会议空前踊跃，他们的反帝情绪十分高涨。大会一致通过的三十多个文件，都贯穿着强烈的反帝精神。决议明确宣布，帝国主义的存在，同世界现状是不相容的。决议号召亚非人民加强团结，把帝国主义、殖民主义彻底铲除掉。大会宣布，反对帝国主义的斗争，是保卫世界和平运动不可分的重要部分，帝国主义存在一天，就不可能有真正的和平共处。这是亚非人民共同的愿望和战斗的呼声。一贯坚决反帝和支持亚非民族解放运动的中国人民，衷心拥护大会的全部决议，热烈祝贺大会的巨大成功。我们要特别向英勇斗争的非洲兄弟，致以崇高的敬意。
    同志们，第二届亚非人民团结大会更明确了：美帝国主义是亚非各国人民共同的、最凶恶的敌人。许多代表在发言中用大量事实，严正谴责和揭露了美帝国主义到处进行侵略活动的种种罪行。他们认为美国从政治、军事、经济、文化思想各方面侵入非洲，是新殖民主义的典型表现。大会通过了支持朝鲜人民、要求美国军队撤出南朝鲜，实现和平统一的决议；通过了支持日本人民、坚决谴责美帝国主义与日本岸信介集团相勾结签订的新的日美“安全条约”的决议。还特别通过了反对以美国为首的帝国主义在亚非各地扩建军事基地和拼凑军事集团的决议。这也就是对土耳其人民的爱国正义斗争的直接支持。这清楚地表明：亚非人民是坚决和南朝鲜、日本、土耳其人民站在一起的。同时，也更证明了科纳克里大会决议，是完全正确的。我们深信，在强大的亚非人民及世界人民的支援下，南朝鲜、日本、土耳其人民的斗争，一定会取得最后胜利的。
    非洲轰轰烈烈的民族解放运动的战斗气氛，始终充满了大会场。英勇的阿尔及利亚的代表受到大会特别热烈的欢迎。大会对阿尔及利亚武装反帝斗争的肯定，就是对在人民中鼓吹所谓不要用暴力反抗帝国主义的人们的严重打击。许多代表指出，亚非人民是热爱和平的，但为反抗帝国主义的暴力统治，他们也是最勇猛善战的人民。如果美帝国主义不早日从亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲滚出去，人民一定会起来把美国强盗通通赶出去！
    同志们，这次亚非人民团结大会还着重号召亚非人民警惕帝国主义的新阴谋，丢掉对帝国主义的任何幻想。只有依靠顽强斗争，依靠自力更生，才能真正得到和巩固独立、和平。当我国代表团团长在大会发言中提到：“中国人民多年的斗争经验证明，在反对帝国主义的斗争中，只要人民决心而且坚持英勇斗争，他们就是不可战胜的”时候，受到了全体代表的热烈欢呼。
    中国代表团受到非洲各国代表普遍、热烈、友好的欢迎。帝国主义分子破坏大会、挑拨中国和非洲友谊的阴谋，被彻底粉碎。中国代表团完成了中国人民的委托，高举了反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义的大旗，同各国代表一起，对大会的成功，作出了应有贡献。我们也对非洲代表支持恢复我国在联合国的合法地位、解放台湾、反对美帝国主义制造“两个中国”阴谋的斗争，表示衷心的感谢！让亚非人民更紧密团结起来，相互支持，胜利前进。为彻底实现第二届亚非人民团结大会的各项决议而共同奋斗。
    土耳其人民爱国正义斗争一定胜利！
    打倒帝国主义、殖民主义！
    全世界人民大团结万岁！
