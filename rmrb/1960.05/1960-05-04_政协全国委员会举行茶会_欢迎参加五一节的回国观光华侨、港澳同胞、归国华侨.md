Xinhua News Agency, 3rd - The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) held a tea party this afternoon in the CPPCC Auditorium to welcome overseas Chinese, Hong Kong and Macao compatriots, returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and returned overseas Chinese students who participated in the "May 1st" International Labor Day celebrations. Today, they gathered happily in the warm family of the motherland, expressing their feelings after a long absence and discussing their experiences of visiting factories, rural people's communes, and urban people's communes. They were inspired by the rapid development of the motherland and the selfless labor enthusiasm of the people in building socialism. Overseas Chinese and Hong Kong and Macao compatriots visiting the motherland expressed their intention to take back the cordial care of the people of the motherland.

He Xiangning, Vice-Chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, spoke at the meeting. On behalf of the CPPCC National Committee, she extended a warm welcome to the more than 800 overseas Chinese, Hong Kong and Macao compatriots, and returned overseas Chinese present. She said that in order to continue to enslave the Asian people and undermine world peace, the U.S. imperialists are using the reactionaries of certain Southeast Asian countries to stir up an anti-China and anti-Chinese movement. However, just like the anti-Chinese movement in Indonesia, it cannot harm us in the slightest. The anti-Chinese movement can only end up hurting themselves. The motherland is deeply concerned about the overseas Chinese, and the motherland government resolutely protects the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese. For those overseas Chinese in Indonesia who are displaced, unable to make a living, or unwilling to continue to reside there, ships are sent to take them back to the motherland. Twenty overseas Chinese farms are now being expanded and newly built, ready to resettle returned overseas Chinese. In the motherland, which continues to make great leaps forward, no matter how many people return, hundreds of thousands or even millions, there are sufficient conditions to resettle them, so that everyone has the opportunity to participate in the socialist construction of the motherland and live in peace and contentment. He Xiangning said that under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the people of all ethnic groups in our country,holding high the three red banners of the general line for socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward, and people’s communes, are advancing bravely and continuing to achieve a great leap forward in the national economy, and have completed the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule. This is a great victory for the people of our country, including the vast number of overseas Chinese, and a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought.

He Xiangning emphasized that in such an inspiring and great era, overseas Chinese should, regardless of whether they are advanced or backward, unite more closely to love the country, unite all who can be united, and work together for the welfare of overseas Chinese; unite more closely and be friendly with the local people; returned overseas Chinese compatriots should be more energetic and strive for progress in developing socialist construction; returned overseas Chinese students should study harder and, under the education of the Party, cultivate themselves into laborers with socialist consciousness and culture; we must, like our compatriots across the country, wholeheartedly make more and better contributions to the socialist construction of the motherland.

He Xiangning concluded by wishing everyone greater achievements and victories in expanding the work of uniting and loving the country, in strengthening friendly unity with the local people, in the struggle against U.S. imperialism and anti-Chinese movements, and in striving to participate in the socialist construction of the motherland.

After her speech, Vice-Chairman He Xiangning had cordial talks with many overseas Chinese compatriots, encouraging the overseas Chinese students and workers who had just returned from Indonesia to study hard and work hard. These overseas Chinese students and workers said, "Please rest assured, we will study hard and work hard."

Chen Shutong, Vice-Chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, also spoke at the meeting. He said that overseas compatriots have personally witnessed the great achievements made by the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, but U.S. imperialism has slandered these achievements. Everyone has seen that the rumors and slanders of U.S. imperialism have not caused the slightest damage to our great socialist construction. On the contrary, it shows that U.S. imperialism is afraid of our Great Leap Forward. Chen Shutong said that we not only achieved a Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959, but we will continue to have a Great Leap Forward this year. He hoped that overseas Chinese would take back the care of the people of the motherland for their overseas Chinese relatives, and take back the ever-changing development of the motherland.

Also present at the tea party were Liao Chengzhi, Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission; Fang Fang, head of the Overseas Chinese Group of the CPPCC National Committee and Vice-Chairman of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese; Zhuang Mingli, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese; members of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC National Committee and members in Beijing; and persons in charge of Beijing Municipality, etc.

    政协全国委员会举行茶会
    欢迎参加五一节的回国观光华侨、港澳同胞、归国华侨
    据新华社3日讯　中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会今天下午在政协礼堂举行茶会，欢迎参加“五一”国际劳动节庆祝活动的回国观光华侨、港澳同胞、归国华侨、侨眷和归国华侨学生。他们今天欢聚在祖国温暖的大家庭里，畅述久别归来的心情，纷纷谈论着参观了工厂、农村人民公社和城市人民公社的感受。他们被祖国一日千里飞跃发展的新形势所鼓舞，被祖国人民建设社会主义的忘我的劳动热情所鼓舞。回国观光华侨和港澳同胞表示，要把祖国人民的亲切关怀带回去。
    政协全国委员会副主席何香凝在会上讲了话。她代表中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会向到会的八百多名华侨、港澳同胞、归侨等，表示热烈欢迎。她说，美帝国主义者为了继续奴役亚洲人民和破坏世界和平，正在利用东南亚某些国家的反动派，掀起反华、排华的逆流。但是，正如印度尼西亚的反华一样，不能动我们一根毫毛，排华只能搬起石头打了他们自己的脚。祖国是深切地关怀侨胞的，祖国政府坚决保护华侨的正当权利和利益，对于在印度尼西亚流离失所、无法谋生或者不愿意继续居留的侨胞，派船接运回国，现在正在扩建和新建华侨农场二十个，准备安置归国华侨。在继续大跃进中的祖国，无论回来多少人，几十万乃至几百万人，都有充分的条件来安置，使人人有机会参加祖国的社会主义建设，安家乐业。何香凝说，我国各族人民，在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，高举着社会主义建设总路线、大跃进和人民公社的三面红旗，奋勇前进，继续实现了国民经济的大跃进，并且提前三年完成了第二个五年计划的主要指标。这是我国人民，包括广大华侨的伟大胜利，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    何香凝着重地说，在这样令人鼓舞的伟大时代里，国外侨胞应当不分先进与落后，更加团结爱国，团结一切可以团结的人们，共同为侨胞的福利事业工作；和当地人民更加团结友好；归侨同胞应当在发展社会主义建设中，更加鼓足干劲，力争上游，归国华侨学生应当更加努力学习，在党的教育下，把自己培养成为有社会主义觉悟、有文化的劳动者；我们要和全国同胞一样，一心一意为祖国的社会主义建设作出更多更好的贡献。
    何香凝最后祝大家在扩大团结爱国的工作中，在加强和当地人民友好团结的努力中，在反对美帝国主义和反排华的斗争中，在努力参加祖国的社会主义建设中，获得更大的成绩和胜利。
    何香凝副主席在讲话后，同许多华侨同胞进行了亲切的谈话，勉励刚从印度尼西亚归国的华侨学生和工人们，努力学习，好好工作。这些华侨学生和工人说，请你老人家放心，我们一定好好学习，好好工作。
    政协全国委员会副主席陈叔通也在会上讲了话。他说，海外同胞这次亲眼看到总路线、大跃进和人民公社所取得的伟大成就，但是美帝国主义却污蔑我们这些成就，大家都看到，美帝国主义的造谣污蔑，我们伟大的社会主义建设不仅没有受到丝毫损害，反而说明美帝国主义害怕我们的大跃进。陈叔通说，我们不仅在1958年1959年获得了大跃进，而且今年还要持续大跃进。他希望华侨把祖国人民对海外华侨亲人般的关怀带回去，把祖国日新月异的发展情况带回去。
    出席茶会的还有华侨事务委员会主任廖承志，政协全国委员会华侨组组长、中华全国归国华侨联合会副主席方方，中华全国归国华侨联合会副主席庄明理，政协全国委员会常委和在北京的委员，以及北京市负责人等。（附图片）
