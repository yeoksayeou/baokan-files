Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 20th. The National Council of the National Front of Democratic Germany held a mass rally of over 8,000 people in the "Werner Seelenbinder" hall in Berlin at 5 p.m. today to welcome Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev.

More than an hour before the meeting, tens of thousands of welcoming people gathered in the square in front of the hall.

Above the rostrum in the hall were huge banners such as "Stop Eisenhower and Adenauer's Provocations."

Those attending the meeting included Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, Prime Minister Otto Grotewahl, Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Chamber Johannes Dieckmann, Chairman of the National Council of the National Front Erich Correns, other party and state leaders, leaders of various democratic parties and people's organizations, as well as representatives from all walks of life in Berlin and from all over the Republic, including workers, members of agricultural production cooperatives, and intellectuals.

Also attending the meeting were Max Reimann, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Germany, Soviet Defense Minister Marshal Rodion Malinovsky, Soviet Ambassador to the German Democratic Republic Mikhail Pervukhin, Commander-in-Chief of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany Ivan Yakubovsky, as well as heads of diplomatic missions of various countries to the German Democratic Republic.

Khrushchev and Ulbricht spoke at the meeting successively.

Khrushchev said that the summit meeting did not take place because the provocations and aggressive activities of the U.S. ruling clique destroyed the meeting. Now, the whole world understands this. American diplomats and those with ulterior motives are trying to shift the responsibility for destroying the meeting onto others, but no matter what tricks they play, the truth will ultimately prevail!

The Soviet Union has been tirelessly preparing for the summit meeting and has made every effort to ensure that there are no complicating factors in the preparation for the meeting. We did not announce combat alerts and atomic exercises, nor did we send military spy planes to the United States. We prepared for the summit meeting with the most serious and benevolent intentions.

It seems that the reactionary forces in the United States, especially the Pentagon, were afraid that the meeting might have a good outcome and did everything possible to sabotage the meeting and obstruct the reaching of an agreement. They sent military reconnaissance planes to invade our country on April 9th. We decided not to protest at that time, so as not to make our enemies feel happy. It seems that they judged it this way: if you can't shoot down the plane, it means you don't have the ability to defend your skies from our invasion.

This is the pressure exerted on us. People in the Pentagon decided to carry out another act of aggression, and the second flight of the spy plane was timed exactly on May Day. The plane took off, but did not return to base. The plane was shot down, and now its wreckage is placed in a reliable "base" – the Moscow Exhibition, and the pilot is about to be tried.

Thus, the imperialist jackals became furious. Usually, the aggressor should apologize at this time, condemn this infringement, guarantee that such incidents will not happen again in the future, and punish the criminals. But this was not done; the aggressor was blinded by rage. They declared that planes had flown here in the past and will fly here in the future, because such actions are beneficial to the national policy of the United States.

This is an act of perfidy. I repeat this word many times because it is difficult to find another word to properly evaluate the arrogance and adventurism of the actions of American national activists.

Only shameless and arrogant people would think that when foreign planes appear in their skies, they can immediately send atomic bombers to retaliate, while their planes can invade the airspace of other countries. Obviously, when they invaded the skies of some countries, they slipped away safely. Therefore, they did it again and again. However, the skies of the Soviet state are not allowed to be invaded by the enemy. If the enemy dares to do so, he will find his grave here.

We condemned this act of aggression at the session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. All the people of our country condemned this action. Now, the Soviet Union has submitted this issue to the Security Council, and Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko has gone there.

Khrushchev said that even in the case of provocation against our country, we still decided to go to Paris, although we considered that doing so might not be necessary. It should be known that the Americans wanted to use the method of sending planes to put pressure on the Soviet Union, making it more compliant, and weakening the Soviet Union's position.

The reason why we came to Paris is that we are faithful to our policy of striving for peace and easing international tensions. We decided to meet with the heads of government and declare that the policy pursued by the United States is not leading to an agreement, but is causing sharp antagonisms and destroying possible agreements.

First, the Soviet government decided to raise such a question to the United States government: does it condemn its own crimes? If it condemns and admits the act of aggression against the Soviet Union, punishes the criminals, and apologizes to us, then we are ready to sit at the round table to work in order to reach the necessary agreements.

At the preparatory meeting of the four heads of government, we firmly and resolutely stated our position to French President Charles de Gaulle, British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, and U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower. Eisenhower, who was in an embarrassing situation in the face of conclusive evidence, adopted the method of hedging and half-acknowledgment. However, in such serious political events, neither perfunctory actions nor half-acknowledgments can change the situation.

If the Soviet Union agreed to hold a meeting under such conditions, then a precedent would be set, and the U.S. warmongers would become ecstatic, thinking that they could do whatever they wanted, thinking that they could speak to us in the language of strength. We cannot participate in the summit meeting under such conditions.

Comrades! All honest people can see, and if anyone doesn't understand this now, they will understand it in the future: the failure of the meeting is not the fault of the Soviet Union.

The Soviet government proposed to convene a summit meeting in six to eight months. If we cannot find a common language with the current U.S. leaders or the president who will succeed Eisenhower to resolve international disputes, then we will wait for the next president. However, we cannot wait for a long time for the settlement of the remnants of World War II, the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, and the solution of the West Berlin issue on this basis. If the Western countries are not prepared to do so, we will have to jointly find solutions to these problems with those countries that have a vital interest in strengthening European peace and are prepared to sign a peace treaty.

Khrushchev also said that now, when the Paris summit meeting has failed to take place due to the destruction by the United States, it is natural to ask what the policies of the Soviet Union and all the socialist countries participating in the Warsaw Pact will be in the next six to eight months. We should consult with the governments of friendly countries on this issue. We will not do anything that will aggravate the international situation and bring it back to the worst moments of the "Cold War." On the contrary, the Soviet government, as before, will make every necessary effort to improve the international situation and improve relations between countries.

We will continue to follow the Leninist line of peaceful coexistence between socialist countries and capitalist countries, striving to ease international tensions, disarmament, and peaceful settlement of disputes.

We had hoped that the summit meeting could promote the solution of extremely important international issues, including the issue of a peace treaty with Germany. But what about the current situation?

Of course, the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries now have full moral rights to resolve the above-mentioned issues without further delay, to sign a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic, thereby also solving the West Berlin issue.

The question is: Has the moment not come to conclude a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic now? It should be known that the United States has also done this, it concluded a unilateral peace treaty with Japan!

We have studied this issue. The following is the conclusion. We believe that although the summit meeting has been destroyed by reactionary forces, the increasingly broad struggle of peaceful forces to consolidate peace and resolve international disputes through negotiations will surely defeat the forces of war and aggression. We are willing to believe that the summit meeting can be held in six to eight months. In this case, there is reason to wait a little longer and try to find a way to solve the long-standing problem of signing a peace treaty with the two existing German states through the joint efforts of all four victorious countries. This matter will not run away from us. We will wait and let it mature further. Therefore, regarding the peace treaty with Germany and the West Berlin issue contained therein, it seems that the status quo must be maintained before the summit meeting, and it should be considered that the summit meeting will be held in six to eight months. The reason why we have come to the conclusion that the meeting may be convened at that time is not only because we ourselves have made such a suggestion, but also because the heads of the three Western countries actually agreed to this suggestion in the communiqué of May 18.

The Western countries—our counterparts at the summit meeting—should correctly understand our position. They should also follow such a principle—not to take any unilateral actions that may hinder the holding of the summit meeting in six to eight months. Only under such circumstances can truly good conditions be created for the future summit meeting and for the discussion of the mature issues that require resolution in order to consolidate world peace.

I think that all people who advocate the policy of peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems will correctly understand us. But at the same time, I want to warn our counterparts again: neither the Soviet Union nor the German Democratic Republic intends to sit on the beach indefinitely waiting for the weather to solve the issue of a peace treaty with Germany. Our long-term patience should not be abused. Peace-loving countries will not allow the occupation system of West Berlin to be permanent.

Khrushchev concluded by saying that we need peace. We will spare no effort to strive for the easing of international tensions, and we will persistently negotiate with Western countries with this purpose. However, we will not allow imperialists to talk to us from a position of strength. We must expose the conspiracies of the aggressors, raise the vigilance of the people of all countries, and make the ranks of fighters for the great and lofty cause of peace more united.

In his speech, Ulbricht said that the Paris events showed that the current governments of the United States and Bonn "have embarked on the road leading to war." Therefore, the cause of peace requires the Soviet government to express such clear and strong opinions in Paris.

The First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany emphasized that the consistent goal of the German Democratic Republic's policy is to eliminate the remnants of World War II. Ulbricht said that the German Democratic Republic agrees with Khrushchev's views on the issue of concluding a peace treaty and resolving the West Berlin issue.

Ulbricht emphasized that in Germany, there are almost daily provocations from Bonn and West Berlin, which is located in the center of the German Democratic Republic, and these actions are in line with the policy of violating Soviet airspace.

Ulbricht continued that the state security agencies of the German Democratic Republic have recently collected a large amount of material related to military espionage activities against the German Democratic Republic.

He pointed out that the government of the German Democratic Republic has sufficient material to prove that the U.S. aggressive bloc is preparing for war in Europe. He said: "Our state security agencies intercepted maps of the German Democratic Republic during unintentional encounters with U.S. officers. The maps marked important targets for military and economic espionage, as well as many places, settlements, etc., prepared for sabotage activities."

The U.S. intelligence agencies, in close collaboration with the intelligence agencies of the Federal Republic of Germany, are trying to establish a radio communications network in the German Democratic Republic in the event of an outbreak of war. Based on this situation, the State Security Department recently discovered a large number of complete sets of radio equipment, including seventeen sets with all the necessary accessories discovered in the last four weeks alone, and weapons equipped with ammunition were also discovered.

Ulbricht emphasized that due to the expansion of the influence of Bonn's militarists in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the danger of war in Europe is also increasing.

Ulbricht said that these facts and the frenzied arming of West Germany clearly show how necessary it is to finally eliminate the remnants of World War II and eliminate the hotbed of war in West Berlin.

    赫鲁晓夫在柏林群众大会上列举事实充分证明
    美国的侵略行动破坏了四国会议
    乌布利希谴责美国和西德对德意志民主共和国不断进行挑衅
    新华社柏林20日电　民主德国全国阵线全国委员会今天下午五时在柏林“魏纳·西兰宾德”大厅举行八千多人的群众大会，欢迎苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫。
    会前一个多小时，大厅前面的广场上聚集了成千上万的欢迎的人群。
    大厅里的主席台上面横挂着“制止艾森豪威尔和阿登纳的挑衅”等巨幅标语。
    参加大会的有德国统一社会党中央第一书记乌布利希、政府总理格罗提渥、人民议院主席团主席狄克曼、全国阵线全国委员会主席柯伦斯、党和国家其他领导人、各民主党派和人民团体领导人，以及柏林和来自共和国各地的工人、农业生产合作社社员、知识分子等各界代表。
    出席大会的还有德国共产党中央第一书记雷曼、苏联国防部长马利诺夫斯基元帅、苏联驻德意志民主共和国大使别尔乌辛和驻德苏军部队总司令雅库鲍夫斯基，以及各国驻德意志民主共和国外交机构负责人。
    赫鲁晓夫和乌布利希在大会上先后讲了话。
    赫鲁晓夫说，最高级会议没有开成，美国统治集团的挑衅和侵略活动破坏了会议。现在，全世界都了解这一点。美国外交家和那些不怀好意的人企图把破坏会议的责任推在别人身上，但是，不管他们玩弄怎样的伎俩，真理终将胜利！
    苏联为最高级会议不懈地进行了准备，并尽了一切努力，使得在准备会议时不出现复杂因素。我们没有宣布战斗警报和原子演习，没有向美国派遣军用间谍飞机。我们怀着最认真和最善良的意愿为最高级会议进行了准备。
    看来，美国反动势力，特别是五角大楼，害怕会议可能有良好的结局，竭尽全力破坏这次会晤，阻挠达成协议。他们派军用侦察机于4月9日侵入我国。我们当时决定不提出抗议，以免使我们的敌人感到畅快。看来，他们是这样来判断的：如果你们打不落飞机，那就意味着你们没有能力保卫自己的天空不受我们的侵犯。
    这就是对我们施加的压力。五角大楼的人士决定再来一次侵略行动，把间谍飞机的第二次飞行时间正好选在“五一”节。飞机起飞了，但是没有飞回基地。飞机被击落了，现在它的残骸放在可靠的“基地”——莫斯科展览会上，而飞行员即将受审。
    这样，帝国主义豺狼暴怒起来。通常，侵略者这时本应道歉，谴责这种侵犯活动，保证以后此类事件不再重演，并惩办罪犯。但是没有这样做，侵略者因盛怒而发昏了。他们宣称，飞机过去曾经飞到我们这里，今后还要飞来，因为这种行动有利于美国的国策。
    这是背信弃义的行为。我多次重复这个字眼，是因为很难找到别的字眼，来恰如其分地评价美国国家活动家的行动的狂妄性和冒险性。
    只有厚颜无耻和骄横傲慢的人才会认为，当他们的天空上出现别国飞机的时候，他们可以立即派原子轰炸机来回击，而他们的飞机却可以侵入别国领空。显然，当他们侵入某些国家的天空的时候，他们安然溜走了。因此他们便一次又一次地这样做。但是，苏维埃国家的天空是不许敌人侵犯的。如果敌人胆敢这样，他就会在这里找到坟墓。
    我们在苏联最高苏维埃会议上谴责了这一侵略行动。我国全体人民都谴责这一行动。现在，苏联已经把这个问题提交安全理事会，外交部长葛罗米柯同志已经去那里了。
    赫鲁晓夫说，甚至在对我国进行了挑衅的情况下，我们仍然决定去巴黎，虽然，我们考虑到，这样做也许没有必要。要知道，美国人想用派遣飞机的办法给苏联施加压力，使它比较顺从，想削弱苏联的立场。
    我们所以到巴黎来是因为我们忠于我们争取和平和和缓紧张局势的政策，我们决定同政府首脑会晤，并声明，美国所奉行的政策不是在导致协议，而是在引起尖锐化和破坏可能取得的协议。
    首先，苏联政府就决定向美国政府提出这样一个问题：它是否谴责自己的罪行？如果它谴责并承认对苏联的侵略行动，惩办罪犯并且向我们道歉，那么我们就准备坐到圆桌旁边进行工作，以便达成必要的协议。
    在四国政府首脑预备会议上我们坚定地、坚决地向法国总统戴高乐、英国首相麦克米伦和艾森豪威尔总统表明了我们的立场。在确凿的事实面前处于尴尬境地的艾森豪威尔采用了支吾搪塞和半承认的手法。但是，在这样的严肃政治事件中无论是敷衍还是半承认，都是不能改变状况的。
    如果苏联同意在这种条件下举行会议，那么就开了先例，美国黩武主义者就会得意忘形起来，满以为他们可以为所欲为，以为他们可以用实力的语言来同我们讲话。我们不能在这种条件下去参加政府首脑会议。
    同志们！所有正直的人们都看到，如果谁现在还不了解这点，那么将来一定会懂得：会议未能举行不是苏联的罪过。
    苏联政府建议在六个月至八个月以后召开政府首脑会议。如果我们同现今的美国领导人或者将接替艾森豪威尔的那位总统都找不到解决国际争端的共同语言的话，那时，我们将等待下一届总统。但是，关于消除第二次世界大战残迹、缔结对德和约和在这个基础上解决西柏林问题——关于这些问题的解决，我们将不能长期等待下去。如果西方国家不准备这样做的话，我们将不得不同那些跟加强欧洲和平有着切身利益关系和准备签订和约的国家共同寻找解决这些问题的办法。
    赫鲁晓夫又说，现在，当巴黎最高级会议由于美国的破坏而未能举行成的时候，很自然会问道，苏联和参加华沙条约的所有社会主义国家的政策在今后六个月至八个月内将是怎样的呢？我们应该就这个问题同友好国家的政府协商。我们不会做出任何使国际局势尖锐化，并使它回到“冷战”最坏时刻的事情。相反，苏联政府同从前一样，将尽一切必要的努力来使国际局势健康化和改善各国之间的关系。
    我们今后仍要遵循社会主义国家同资本主义国家和平共处的列宁主义路线，争取缓和国际紧张局势、裁军和和平解决争执问题。
    我们本来指望最高级会议能推动包括对德和约问题在内的极端重要的国际问题的解决。而在现在的形势下怎么办呢？
    当然，苏联和其他爱好和平的国家现在拥有充分的道义上的权利不再继续拖延地解决上述问题，同德意志民主共和国签订和约，从而也使西柏林问题得到解决。
    试问：现在就同德意志民主共和国缔结和约的时刻没有到来吗？要知道，美国也这样干过，它同日本缔结了单方面的和约！
    我们研究了这个问题。下面就是得出的结论。我们相信，尽管最高级会议被反动势力破坏了，但是，和平力量为巩固和平和通过谈判解决国际争端而进行的日益广泛的斗争，一定会战胜战争和侵略势力。我们愿意相信，最高级会议能在六—八个月后举行。在这种情况下，就有根据再稍等待一下，并试图通过所有四个战胜国的共同努力找到解决早已成熟了的同两个现存的德国签订和约的问题的办法。这件事不会从我们这里跑掉的。我们将等待，让它更加成熟。因此，关于对德和约和其中的西柏林问题，看来在政府首脑会晤之前得要保持现状，应该认为，政府首脑会议将在六—八个月后举行。我们之所以得出会议可能在那时召开的结论，不只是因为我们自己提出了这样的建议，而且还因为西方三国首脑在5月18日的公报中实际上也同意了这个建议。
    西方国家——我们的最高级会议的对方，应该正确理解我们的立场。它们方面也应当遵循这样的原则——不采取任何可能阻碍六个月到八个月以后举行政府首脑会议的单方面行动。只有在这种情况下，才能够为未来的政府首脑会晤，为讨论为了巩固全世界和平而要求解决的已经成熟的问题真正创造良好的条件。
    我想，所有主张执行不同社会制度的国家和平共处政策的人们都会正确地理解我们。但同时我要再次警告我们的对方：无论苏联或德意志民主共和国都绝不打算无限期地坐在海边等待解决对德和约问题的天气。不应该滥用我们的长期忍耐的态度。爱好和平的国家不允许西柏林占领制度永久化。
    赫鲁晓夫最后说，我们需要和平。我们将不惜一切努力来争取国际紧张局势的缓和，我们将抱着这样的目的坚持不懈地同西方国家进行谈判。但是，我们不允许帝国主义分子从实力地位同我们谈话。我们要揭露侵略者的阴谋，提高各国人民的警惕性，使争取伟大而崇高的和平事业的战士的队伍更加团结。
    乌布利希在讲话中说，巴黎事件表明，美国和波恩的现政府“已经走上了导致战争的道路”。因此，和平事业要求苏联政府在巴黎表示这样明确的、强烈的意见。
    德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记强调指出，德意志民主共和国的政策一贯的目的就是要消除第二次世界大战的残迹。乌布利希说，德意志民主共和国同意赫鲁晓夫关于缔结和约问题和解决西柏林问题的意见。
    乌布利希着重指出，在德国，差不多每天有人从波恩和位于德意志民主共和国中心的西柏林进行各种挑衅行动，这些行动与侵犯苏联领空的方针是同出一辙的。
    乌布利希接着说，德意志民主共和国的国家保安机关最近搜集了大量有关对德意志民主共和国进行军事间谍活动的材料。
    他指出，德意志民主共和国政府有足够的材料证明，美国侵略集团正在欧洲准备战争。他说：“我们的国家安全机关在同美国军官决非情愿地相遇时截获了德意志民主共和国的地图，地图上标有进行军事和经济间谍活动的重要目标，以及准备用来进行破坏活动的许多地方、居民点等等。”
    美国谍报机关同德意志联邦共和国谍报机关密切勾结，力图在一旦爆发战争时便在德意志民主共和国建立起无线电通讯网，根据这种情况，国家安全部最近发现了大批成套的无线电设备，其中仅在最近四个星期内发现的就有十七套带有一切必需附件的设备，并且发现了配备弹药的武器。
    乌布利希就此强调指出，由于波恩军国主义分子在北大西洋公约组织中的影响的扩大，欧洲战争的危险性也随着增长。
    乌布利希说，这些事实和狂热武装西德的做法很明显地表明了，最后消灭第二次世界大战残迹和消除西柏林战火策源地是多么的必要。
