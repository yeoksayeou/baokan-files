Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 6th: The first session of the Shanghai Catholic Representative Conference was held from April 23rd to 26th. The conference discussed and summarized the experiences of the Shanghai Catholic community in its struggle against American imperialism and its tool, the Vatican, and established the Shanghai Catholic Patriotic Association and independently elected a bishop.

    Attending the conference were 683 representatives of Catholic believers, priests, and nuns from various districts and counties in Shanghai. 172 people attended as observers. Pi Shushi, Archbishop and Chairman of the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association, Vice Chairmen Bishop Li Weiguang, Bishop Zhao Zhensheng, and 37 bishops, priests, and believers from Beijing, Hebei, Shandong, Anhui, Jiangsu, Hubei, Zhejiang, Fujian, and other provinces and cities were invited to attend the conference.

    This conference was convened under the circumstances of the great victory achieved by the Shanghai Catholic community in its anti-imperialist patriotic struggle. In recent years, under the leadership of the Party and with the support of people from all walks of life, Shanghai Catholics have persistently carried out the struggle against American imperialism and its tool, the Vatican, for using Catholicism to undermine New China, and have achieved great victories. In mid-March of this year, the Shanghai Intermediate People's Court's solemn judgment against the American spy Hua Lizhu and the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary treasonous group, who were hidden within the Chinese Catholic Church, was a heavy blow to the subversive activities of American imperialism and the Vatican using Catholicism. In group discussions and speeches at the conference, the representatives excitedly cheered the victory of the anti-imperialist patriotic struggle of the Catholic Church. Many Catholic representatives, priests, and nuns further exposed the facts of the collusion between American imperialism and the Vatican in using Catholicism to carry out subversive activities against our country. The representatives unanimously agreed that Shanghai Catholics, like Catholics throughout the country, must thoroughly and permanently break away from all control by the Vatican and take the road of independence and self-reliance in running the Church. They expressed that in the future they will more firmly support the leadership of the Party, follow the socialist road, deeply carry out the anti-imperialist patriotic movement under the brilliant illumination of the general line of socialist construction, and work together with the people of the whole country to contribute to the socialist construction of the motherland.

    The conference announced the establishment of the Shanghai Catholic Patriotic Association and elected Hu Wenyao as Director, and Yang Shida, Zhang Jiashu, Tang Lüdao, and Lu Weidu as Deputy Directors. The representatives present also unanimously elected Father Zhang Jiashu as Bishop of the Shanghai Diocese through democratic means. The resolution passed at the meeting pointed out that this is the victorious fruit of the Shanghai Catholics' continuous anti-imperialist patriotic movement under the leadership of the Party for the past ten years, and another heavy blow to the conspiracy of American imperialism and the Vatican to use Catholicism to carry out subversive activities against our country.

    新华社上海6日电  上海市天主教第一届第一次代表会议，在4月23日到26日举行。会议讨论和总结了上海天主教界同美帝国主义及其工具罗马教廷斗争的经验，成立了上海市天主教友爱国会，并自选了主教。
    出席这次会议的，有上海市各区、县教徒代表和神甫、修女代表六百八十三人。列席会议的有一百七十二人。中国天主教友爱国会主席皮漱石总主教、副主席李维光主教、赵振声主教和北京、河北、山东、安徽、江苏、湖北、浙江、福建等省市的主教、神甫、教徒三十七人应邀参加了会议。
    这次会议是在上海天主教界反帝爱国斗争取得很大胜利的形势下召开的。几年来上海市天主教徒在党的领导下和各界人民的支持下，坚持不懈地开展反对美帝国主义及其工具罗马教廷利用天主教破坏新中国的斗争，已经取得了很大胜利。今年3月中旬，上海市中级人民法院对隐藏在中国天主教中的美国间谍华理柱和龚品梅反革命叛国集团的严正判决，更是对美帝国主义和罗马教廷利用天主教进行颠覆活动的沉重打击。代表们在小组讨论和大会发言中，都兴奋地为天主教反帝爱国斗争的胜利欢呼。许多教徒代表和神甫、修女代表还进一步揭露了美帝国主义和罗马教廷共同勾结，利用天主教对我国进行颠覆活动的事实。代表们一致认为，上海天主教徒和全国天主教徒一样，必须彻底地永远地摆脱罗马教廷的一切控制，走独立自主、自办教会的道路。他们表示今后要更加坚定不移地拥护党的领导，走社会主义道路，在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，深入开展反帝爱国运动，并且和全国人民一道为祖国社会主义建设作出贡献。
    会议宣告成立了上海市天主教友爱国会，选出了胡文耀为主任，杨士达、张家树、汤履道、陆薇读为副主任。到会代表并且通过民主方式，一致选举了张家树神甫为上海教区主教。在会议通过的决议中指出，这是上海天主教徒十年来在党的领导下不断开展反帝爱国运动的胜利果实，是对美帝国主义和罗马教廷利用天主教对我国进行颠覆活动阴谋的又一沉重打击。
