Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 9th: The National Council of the All-Indonesia Central Trade Union has issued a statement calling on Indonesian workers to condemn the Dutch imperialists' military provocations in West Irian and demanding that the government take resolute measures to completely eradicate Dutch economic power in Indonesia.

The statement said that the purpose of the Dutch imperialists in strengthening their military forces and intensifying military provocations in West Irian is to strengthen their colonial rule there and to encourage their running dogs—the comprador class, the remnants of the Darul Islam terrorist gangs, the "Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia" and the "Charter of Overall Struggle Movement" and other counter-revolutionary rebel groups.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 10th: According to reports in the local press, hundreds of university students and young people in Bandung recently held demonstrations to protest the provocative military exercises conducted by the Dutch in West Irian.

They held up placards reading "Get the Dutch Out!" and submitted a statement opposing Dutch provocations to the Bandung City Council. The statement demanded the immediate severing of diplomatic relations with the Dutch and the confiscation of the Batavia Petroleum Company, a Dutch enterprise that has not yet been taken over.
