Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 23rd: Three hundred thousand people from all walks of life in Yunnan Province and Kunming City held an unprecedentedly massive demonstration rally on the 22nd to support the Soviet government's solemn stance against the aggressive crimes of U.S. imperialism and to angrily condemn U.S. imperialism for sabotaging the Four-Power Summit Conference.

At twelve noon, tens of thousands of angry people, holding large banners and shouting slogans, poured into Tuodong Stadium; vast numbers of workers and farmers from the suburbs also headed to more than a dozen other venues, with angry slogans echoing in every corner of the city.

Party and government leaders of Yunnan Province and Kunming City, military leaders stationed in the area, heads of various people's organizations, and responsible persons of local organizations of various democratic parties all participated in the rally. Soviet experts, Czechoslovak experts, personnel from the Vietnamese Consulate in Kunming, and Vietnamese interns in Kunming also participated in the conference.

Ma Jikong, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke amidst warm applause. He represented the 20 million people of all ethnic groups in Yunnan Province, expressing firm support for the Soviet Union's solemn stance on the Four-Power Summit Conference and firm opposition to the United States' aggression and provocation against the Soviet Union. He said: It is not surprising that U.S. imperialism sabotaged the Four-Power Summit Conference. Only under the pressure of the people of the world, U.S. imperialism was forced to feign peace and agree to hold the Four-Power Summit Conference. Now, U.S. imperialism has stripped off its peaceful disguise in front of the people of the world with its own bandit behavior, and once again exposed U.S. imperialism as the number one enemy of world peace. The people of our country and the people of the world have recognized that U.S. imperialism is the deadly enemy of peace, and Eisenhower is a bloodstained executioner and bandit chieftain. If U.S. imperialism dares to carry out military provocations and armed aggression against socialist countries, it will surely be subject to devastating blows.

Ma Jikong's speech aroused bursts of applause and slogans from the audience.

Subsequently, representatives of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and local organizations of various democratic parties, Cun Shusheng; representatives of the Yunnan Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and the Yunnan China-Soviet Friendship Association, Xu Jiarui; and representatives of workers and farmers all spoke at the conference.

After the meeting, 300,000 people of all ethnic groups held a large demonstration and parade, with angry roars shaking this frontier city.

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 23rd: Two hundred and fifty thousand people in Guiyang City held demonstrations and rallies at seven locations, including the Liuguangmen Stadium, on the 22nd to support the Soviet government's solemn stance against the aggressive crimes of U.S. imperialism and to angrily condemn U.S. imperialism for sabotaging the Four-Power Summit Conference.

From noon onwards, the main streets and small alleys in the urban area and the industrial and mining areas and villages in the suburbs gradually gathered crowds of demonstrators. They carried signs, cartoons, and shouted slogans, gathering at the meeting places. People raised flags and shouted slogans, making the mountain city of Guiyang boil.

Ten thousand people participated in the conference at Liuguangmen Stadium and nearby locations. At the same time, 150,000 people held demonstrations and rallies at six other gathering points.

Party and government leaders of Guizhou Province, responsible persons of various democratic parties, and various people's organizations all participated in the conference. Soviet experts helping with construction in Guiyang also attended the conference.

Zhang Haifeng, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, first spoke at the meeting. He said: The 17 million people of Guizhou Province all condemn the bandit behavior of U.S. imperialism in invading the Soviet Union with extremely angry hearts. His speech was interrupted time and time again by the storm-like applause and slogans of the masses. Subsequently, Tian Junliang, Vice Chairman of the Guizhou Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, Gu Guangzhong, representative of various democratic parties, Li Mingyuan, representative of various people's organizations, Zhang Jun, model worker of the Guizhou Automobile Parts Factory, and Fu Wanxing, agricultural labor model of the Qianling People's Commune, also spoke at the meeting. During their speeches, warm applause and passionate slogans were constantly heard from the crowd.

After the meeting, the masses held a demonstration parade. More than 500 workers from the Guizhou Automobile Manufacturing Factory traveled from the suburbs to participate in the rally and demonstration parade. Students from major universities and middle schools worked overnight to produce cartoons, slogans, and compile short plays to participate in the demonstration parade.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 23rd: Two hundred thousand people from all walks of life in Nanning City, the capital of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, held a large-scale demonstration and rally on the 22nd to resolutely support the Soviet government's solemn stance against the aggressive crimes of U.S. imperialism and to angrily condemn U.S. imperialism for sabotaging the Four-Power Summit Conference.

Workers, farmers, students, cadres, members of urban people's communes, and officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army of all ethnic groups participating in the demonstration rally continuously raised their arms and shouted: "Oppose U.S. imperialism's aggression and provocation against the Soviet Union!"
"People of the world, unite and overthrow U.S. imperialism!"

Wei Guoqing, Secretary of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman of the Autonomous Region, spoke at the conference. He represented the 20 million people of all ethnic groups in Guangxi, expressing firm support for the Soviet government's solemn stance against the aggressive crimes of U.S. imperialism. He said that in order to deceive the people of the world, U.S. imperialism, on the one hand, pretends to be peaceful, and on the other hand, actively expands its arms and prepares for war, creating international tension. This is its two-pronged approach to dealing with the people of the world. Now it openly sabotages the Four-Power Summit Conference, which fully exposes its aggressive nature in front of the people of the world, making the people of the world more clearly realize that the achievement of world peace ultimately depends on the unity and struggle of the people. Wei Guoqing's speech was constantly interrupted by the enthusiastic applause and slogans of the masses.

Representatives of workers and farmers then spoke at the conference, unanimously condemning U.S. imperialism's aggression and provocation against the Soviet Union, pointing out that U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the people of the world who have done all kinds of bad things. A farmer representative said in his speech that U.S. imperialism is a mad dog that bites everywhere. But peace-loving people will never allow this mad dog to run rampant.

People in Guilin, Wuzhou, and other cities also held rallies and parades. More than 50,000 people in Guilin held a mass rally in the heavy rain. There were 40,000 people gathered for a demonstration in Wuzhou. (Attached photo)

    中午十二点钟，成千上万愤怒的群众，举着大幅标语，高呼着口号，涌向拓东体育场；郊区的广大工人、农民也都走向另外十几个会场，愤怒的口号声响遍了全市每个角落。

    马继孔的讲话，激起了全场一阵又一阵的掌声和口号声。
    接着，政协云南省委员会和各民主党派地方组织代表寸树声、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会云南省分会和云南中苏友好协会代表徐嘉瑞，以及工人、农民的代表，都在大会上讲了话。

    从中午起，市区各大街小巷和市郊的工矿区、村寨，逐渐汇集起示威的人群。他们抬着标语牌、漫画，高呼口号，向集会地点集中。人们高举旗帜，振臂高呼口号，山城贵阳整个沸腾起来。

    工人、农民的代表等接着在大会上讲话，他们一致斥责美帝国主义对苏联的侵略和挑衅，指出美帝国主义是作尽了坏事的全世界人民最凶恶的敌人。农民代表在讲话中说，美帝国主义是一条疯狗，到处乱咬。但是爱好和平的人民决不允许这条疯狗横行。
