(Our newspaper's dispatch from Chengdu, May 30th) The Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant, by tapping the potential of its manpower, material resources, and equipment, and closely integrating with production needs, has launched satellite factories on a large scale and vigorously engaged in diversified operations. It has initially developed into a comprehensive joint enterprise encompassing the steel industry, chemical industry, and building materials industry.

After the Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant was fully completed and put into production in 1958, it reached its designed capacity in only six months. Currently, its production capacity has exceeded the designed level by more than four times. With the great leap forward in enterprise production and the increase in mechanization and automation, the demand for raw materials has increased, and the specifications have become more stringent. Some materials have become insufficient in supply. Faced with this situation, should they stagnate or continue to leap forward? Should they reach out to the state, or rely on their own efforts? The Party Committee of the Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant adopted the latter approach and organized employees to engage in debate and criticism, criticizing the ideology of passive waiting. Subsequently, they organized the labor force and machinery and equipment saved through the technological revolution and used the waste materials within the enterprise to launch satellite factories on a large scale and engage in the production of raw materials. In the past two years, the plant has built fourteen satellite factories, including steel, brick and tile, chemical, cement, and sawdust particleboard plants. In the steel sector, a small-scale steel complex with an annual output of 30,000 to 50,000 tons has been established, including workshops for ironmaking, steelmaking, steel rolling, and refractory materials. In the first quarter of this year alone, the steel plant produced 4,422 tons of steel and 1,400 tons of steel materials, including special specifications or special models of steel required for the production of measuring and cutting tools. Currently, one-third of the high-quality steel and medium carbon steel needed by the whole plant is produced and supplied by the plant itself.

A feature of the plant's diversified operations is that not only have comprehensive satellite factories been built for the entire plant, but also each branch plant, office, workshop, and even production team has launched satellite factories closely integrated with production needs. Some are specifically established to break through critical and weak links in production; some are self-manufacturing machinery and equipment to arm themselves; and some are established to complete collaborative tasks based on the production needs of the workshop.

"The large supporting the small, the small supporting the large; lacking what, supplement what; wanting what, do what." This is a successful experience of the plant in engaging in diversified operations and developing towards a comprehensive joint enterprise. Without cement, the basic construction department used blast furnace slag as raw material to build a cement plant; without bricks and tiles, they built kilns and dug soil to fire them themselves; lacking wood, they used sawdust shavings to process into man-made fiberboard; the production of measuring and cutting tools requires chemical raw materials such as potassium nitrate for quenching, and the supply department started from scratch, from small to large, from indigenous to modern methods, using local materials to build a chemical plant. The production of measuring and cutting tools requires a large number of grinding tools such as grinding wheels. The tool warehouse management personnel successfully manufactured ball mills, sand sifters, and automatic sand cloth lines and built a grinding wheel plant. Since last year, the plant has produced fourteen varieties, seventy-five specifications, and more than one million grinding wheels.

The Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant has vigorously engaged in diversified operations, produced a large number of raw materials, improved the technical level of workers, ensured the continuous leap forward in production, and completed the state plan more than a month ahead of schedule in the first quarter. At the same time, it has supported national construction and fraternal factories and mines. Since the beginning of this year, it has transferred more than 1,000 tons of high-quality steel.

    结合生产，大办钢铁、化工和建筑材料卫星厂
    成都量具刃具厂发展成综合性联合企业
    许多特殊钢材自己生产，今年已调出一千多吨优质钢材支援国家建设
    本报成都30日电　成都量具刃具厂挖掘企业人力、物力和设备的潜力，紧密结合生产需要，大办卫星厂，大搞多种经营，已初步发展成一个拥有钢铁工业、化学工业、建筑材料工业的综合性联合企业。
    成都量具刃具厂在1958年全部建成投入生产后，只用半年时间就达到了设计水平，目前的生产能力已超过设计水平四倍多。随着企业生产大跃进和机械化、自动化程度的提高，对原料材料的需要量就更大，规格要求更严。有的材料便显得供应不足。面对这种情况，是停滞不前，还是继续跃进？是伸手向国家要，还是自力更生？成都量具刃具厂党委采取了后一种办法，并组织职工通过鸣放辩论，批判了消极等待的思想。接着便组织技术革命中节约下来的劳动力、机具设备，利用企业内部的废弃物资，大办卫星厂，大搞原材料生产。两年来，这个厂兴建了钢铁、砖瓦、化工、水泥、锯末刨花板等十四个卫星工厂。钢铁方面，已经搞起了一座年产三至五万吨的小型钢铁联合企业；这个企业包括了炼铁、炼钢、轧钢、耐火材料等车间。仅今年第一季度，钢铁厂就生产了四千四百二十二吨钢，一千四百吨钢材，其中包括生产量具刃具需要的特殊规格或特殊型号的钢材。现在，全厂已有三分之一的优质钢材和中炭钢材，由本厂生产供应。
    这个厂大搞多种经营的一个特点是：不仅兴建了全厂性的卫星厂，而且各个分厂、办公室、车间，甚至生产小组，也都紧密结合生产需要大办卫星厂。有专门为突破生产关键和薄弱环节而办的；有自造机具设备武装自己的；有根据车间生产需要为完成协作任务而办的。
    “以大带小，以小援大；缺啥补啥，要啥干啥。”这是该厂大搞多种经营，向综合性联合企业方向发展的一条成功的经验。没有水泥，基本建设科就利用高炉矿渣为原料，建设水泥厂；没有砖瓦，就自己建窑挖土烧制；缺少木材，就用锯末刨花加工制成人造纤维板；产品淬火需要硝酸钾等化工原料，供应科就白手起家，由小到大，由土到洋，就地取材，建设化工厂。生产量具刃具，需要大量的砂轮等磨料工具，工具库管理人员自制成功了球磨机、筛砂机和砂布自动线等设备，建成了一座砂轮厂。这个厂从去年到现在，共生产了十四个品种、七十五个规格、一百多万件砂轮。
    成都量具刃具厂大搞多种经营，生产了大批原料材料，提高了工人的技术水平，保证了生产持续跃进，第一季度就提前一个多月完成了国家计划。同时支援了国家建设和兄弟厂矿。今年以来，就调出了优质钢材一千多吨。
