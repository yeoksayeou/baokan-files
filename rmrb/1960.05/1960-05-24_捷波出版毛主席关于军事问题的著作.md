Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Czechoslovakia's "Our Army Publishing House" has recently published a selection of Mao Zedong's works on military affairs. The book has a total of three hundred and eighty-three pages, divided into three main parts: the Second Chinese Revolutionary Civil War period, the Anti-Japanese War period, and the Third Revolutionary Civil War period.

The editorial department pointed out in the "Editor's Note" of the book that this selection includes the most important works of Comrade Mao Zedong, the outstanding leader of the Chinese Communist Party, a brilliant Marxist, and an expert on military issues, on the Chinese people's revolutionary war.

The Czechoslovak Ministry of National Defense's newspaper "People's Defense" published a book review for this purpose, writing that this selection is of great significance because Comrade Mao Zedong brilliantly applied Marxist doctrine to revolutionary war and military science based on China's conditions, and derived broad and truly effective conclusions through the analysis of facts. The review emphasized that Mao Zedong's works can be placed alongside the most important works of Engels and Lenin on issues of war and military science.

The Polish Ministry of National Defense Publishing House recently published a selection of Mao Zedong's military works. The selection includes works such as "Why Is It That Red Political Power Can Exist in China?", "The Struggle in Jinggang Mountains", "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire", "Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War", "On Protracted War", "On Coalition Government", and "The Present Situation and Our Tasks".

The editors of the selection said in the preface that Mao Zedong made a profound Marxist analysis of the various stages of the domestic revolutionary war in his works. "Mao Zedong's theory on the Chinese revolutionary war and the summary of the extremely rich experience of the Chinese people and their armed forces are a major contribution to the Marxist-Leninist science of war, the army, and military academics."
