He said: The working class and people of Shanghai deeply understand from their own experience that no matter how fierce imperialism may appear on the surface, because they have done all kinds of bad things and cannot gain the sympathy of the people, they will eventually be overthrown by the people.

In conclusion, Ke Qingshi proposed a toast to the unity of the working class and oppressed people of the world and to the ultimate victory of the anti-imperialist struggle of the people of the five continents.

    上海市总工会举行酒会招待各国工会代表团和代表
    据新华社上海16日电　上海市总工会15日晚上举行盛大酒会，招待前来上海访问的亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲、欧洲和澳洲的二十四个国家的工会代表团和工会代表。
    中共上海市委第一书记、上海市市长柯庆施，中共上海市委书记处候补书记、上海市副市长刘述周出席了酒会。
    柯庆施在酒会上讲了话。他代表上海人民热烈欢迎各国工会代表团和工会代表来上海访问。他说，上海人民过去深受帝国主义和反动派欺凌压迫的痛苦，对目前还在帝国主义压迫剥削下的亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲、欧洲和澳洲各国工人阶级和人民的处境，寄予深切的关怀和同情。他说：上海工人阶级和人民从自己的经历中深深懂得：帝国主义不管它们表面上如何凶狠，但因它们做尽了坏事，没法取得人民的同情，最后一定要被人民打倒。
    柯庆施最后提议为全世界工人阶级和被压迫人民的团结、为五大洲人民反帝国主义斗争取得最后的胜利而干杯。
