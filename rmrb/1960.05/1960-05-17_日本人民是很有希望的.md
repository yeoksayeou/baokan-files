The Japanese People Are Very Promising
By Our Commentator

Today, on page five of this newspaper, we published two letters to "Asahi Shimbun" from two Japanese soldiers, one old and one young, which are worth reading.

One of the letter writers is Saburo Endo, nearly seventy years old, who was once a senior general in the Japanese imperial army and a contemporary of Nobusuke Kishi. A former soldier like him, who has experienced the vicissitudes of life, has learned the lessons he should have learned from the history of the Japanese militarist war of aggression and reached the conclusion that history must not be repeated. The new "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty," which is hostile to China, the Soviet Union, and the people of Asia, is neither secure nor secure for Japan. Therefore, he advocates peaceful and friendly coexistence with neighboring countries.

The other is Kazumi Yamamoto, a 26-year-old member of the "Self-Defense Forces," a member of today's revived Japanese militarist armed forces. This young man was only a child under the age of eleven in 1945, when Japanese militarism was defeated. He has no personal experience of the war of aggression launched by Japanese militarists. However, today he has come to realize and understand that the conclusion of the aggressive U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, which is hostile to China and the Soviet Union, is a road to war. He is unwilling to sell his life for the aggressive war launched by the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries. He swears to the people: He will never fire a gun for a war of aggression!

The reason why these two letters have their special significance is that U.S. imperialism and Nobusuke Kishi are betting their rule over Japan and the launching of aggressive wars on the Japanese military. The U.S. and Japanese reactionaries have been trying their best to incite the revanchist sentiments of the old Japanese soldiers and have been doing their best to conduct militarist education among the youth, in an attempt to use them as sacrifices for the revival of Japanese militarism, rearmament, and the pursuit of aggression and expansion by U.S. imperialism in the Far East. However, the reactionary policy of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries to drag Japan onto the road of war is so obviously contrary to the interests of the Japanese people that some of the older generation of former soldiers have become aware of it and embarked on the road of patriotism and love of peace; some of the younger generation of new soldiers have also begun to see through the conspiracy of Nobusuke Kishi and his masters and are determined not to serve as cannon fodder for the aggressive war they launched. From these two letters, it can be seen that the writers are a former soldier and an active soldier who hold different political views, and they have all become aware of it. There will certainly be more and more people like this, which cannot but be a heavy blow to the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries.

Chairman Mao said on May 14: "The Japanese people are very promising." After we heard that 13.5 million people in Japan had signed to oppose the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty as of the 14th, and after we read these two letters, we felt even more cordial to what Chairman Mao said. Chairman Mao pointed out that "U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the Chinese and Japanese people, and the common enemy of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and the common enemy of all peace-loving people in the world. Imperialism cultivates its running dogs in many countries, and these running dogs are not liked by the people of their own countries. The Nobusuke Kishi government of Japan is such a government. Patriotic people of insight in the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party have also expressed their dissatisfaction with Nobusuke Kishi's reactionary policies. At present, the Japanese people are launching a large-scale struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. In the struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, the Japanese people are becoming more and more aware, and more and more people are becoming aware."

Isn't it? At present, the sea is turbulent in Japan, and the sixteenth unified action of the Japanese people against the ratification of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty is like a surging wave. The Japanese people, who are persisting in the anti-American patriotic just struggle, are united under the resounding call of opposing the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, their fighting spirit is becoming more and more firm, their actions are becoming more and more extensive, and the scale is becoming larger and larger. The number of people participating in the unified action is often in the tens of millions. The development of the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic just struggle vividly shows that the Japanese people are very promising. The peace-loving Japanese people, who are becoming more and more aware, have recognized and will further recognize that their enemy is U.S. imperialism and its running dog, Nobusuke Kishi, and that U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the Asian people. With increased awareness, the aware Japanese people should not harbor any illusions about U.S. imperialism. We have always believed that it is the Japanese people who decide Japan's destiny, not reactionaries like Nobusuke Kishi. The National Conference of Representatives of Joint Struggle Organizations Against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" held in Tokyo on May 14 issued an emergency declaration saying: "We cannot allow the Nobusuke Kishi government to continue to remain in office, because this government is trying to decide the fate of the country unilaterally." The declaration also said that it is necessary to prevent the Diet from ratifying the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." And solemnly called on the Japanese people to rise up and overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi government. One of the public leaders who participated in the conference, Inejiro Asanuma, chairman of the Japanese Socialist Party, said that the Japanese people do not trust the ruling party, and the conditions for dissolving the Diet have matured. Immediately the next day, the Japanese Socialist Party passed a resolution condemning the Nobusuke Kishi group's conspiracy to forcibly approve the new "Security Treaty" and demanding the immediate dissolution of the Diet and the resignation of the Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet. The resolution said: "On the issue of whether to approve the Security Treaty, the people are the highest judges." It is very clear that the increasingly awakened and united Japanese people are an invincible force. As Sanzo Nosaka, chairman of the Japanese Communist Party, pointed out, the Japanese people are different from fifteen years ago, their political awareness has greatly improved, and they currently have unprecedentedly powerful organizations and tactics, and are fighting to open up a new history for Japan. The two letters from Japanese soldiers published in this newspaper today are one of the powerful proofs that the Japanese people have generally awakened.

"The Japanese people are very promising" has become a huge source of encouragement for the Japanese people. At the mass rally held by the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party in Tokyo, the chairman of the meeting, Kenji Miyamoto, introduced Chairman Mao's speech on May 14, and all the participants applauded enthusiastically. Leaders from all walks of life in Japan have issued statements fully supporting Chairman Mao's remarks and expressing that they will continue to fight to the end against U.S. imperialism's policy of undermining peace.

Nobusuke Kishi's reactionary plot to remain incorrigible has aroused the vigilance and anger of the Japanese people. The National Conference of Representatives of Joint Struggle Organizations Against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" has decided to mobilize 5,000 people to petition the Diet every day from today to the 26th, and 10,000 to 20,000 people will be mobilized to participate in the petition action on the 19th. The 20th will reach the climax of the struggle. A time-limited strike or workplace meeting will be held nationwide. From 4:30 p.m. on the same day, joint struggle organizations in various parts of the country will simultaneously hold large-scale rallies and demonstrations. The Japanese people's determination to fight the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries to the end is a huge force to prevent the Diet from ratifying the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. The Japanese people are very promising!

    日本人民是很有希望的
    本报评论员
    今天本报第五版上，发表了两位日本军人，一老一少，给“朝日新闻”的两封信，很值得人们一读。
    写这两封信的，一位是年近古稀的远藤三郎，曾经是日本帝国主义军队中一个高级将领，是岸信介的同代人。像他这样一位曾经沧桑的旧军人，从过去日本军国主义侵略战争的历史中吸取了应有的教训，得出一个结论：历史不许重演，以中苏和亚洲人民为敌的新“日美安全保障条约”，对于日本说来是既不安也不保。因此，他主张同近邻国家和平友好相处。
    另一位是二十六岁的“自卫队”队员山本一三，他是今天复活了的日本军国主义武装部队的一个成员。这位青年在日本军国主义战败的1945年，还只是一个不满十一岁的儿童，他对于日本军国主义者发动的侵略战争根本没有切身的体验。但是，他今天却已认识和了解到，缔结以中苏为敌的侵略性日美军事同盟条约，是通往战争的道路，他不愿意为美日反动派发动侵略战争卖命，他向人民宣誓：绝不为侵略战争开枪！
    这两封信之所以有它的特别意义，是由于美帝国主义和岸信介是把它们统治日本、发动侵略战争的赌注押在日本军人身上的。美日反动派一直竭力煽动日本旧军人的复仇主义情绪，并百般地对青年进行军国主义的教育，企图利用它们来作为复活日本军国主义、重新武装和追随美帝国主义在远东实行侵略与扩张的牺牲品。但是，美日反动派把日本拖上战争道路的反动政策，是如此明显地违反日本人民的利益的，老一辈的旧军人中已经有人觉悟起来，走上了爱国、爱和平的道路；年青一代的新军人，也有人开始看透了岸信介及其主子的阴谋，决心不给他们发动的侵略战争充当炮灰。从这两封信中，可以看出写信的是持有不同政治观点的一个旧军人，一个现役军人，也都觉悟起来了。这样的人必定越来越多，这对于美日反动派，不能不是一个沉重的打击。
    毛主席在5月14日说：“日本人民是很有希望的。”对于毛主席说的话，在我们听到日本到14日为止签字反对日美军事同盟条约的人有一千三百五十万，和在我们读到这两封信件之后，更令人感觉到十分亲切。毛主席指出：“美帝国主义是中日两国人民的共同敌人，是亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民的共同敌人，是全世界爱好和平人民的共同敌人。帝国主义在许多国家培养它的走狗，这些走狗是本国人民所不喜欢的。日本的岸信介政府就是这样的政府。日本自由民主党的有识爱国人士，也对岸信介的反动政策表示不满。目前日本人民正在展开规模宏大的斗争，反对日美军事同盟条约。日本人民在反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争中，觉悟一天天提高，觉悟的人越来越多。”
    不是吗？目前，日本海上风聚云涌，日本人民反对批准日美军事同盟条约的第十六次统一行动，有如波涛汹涌。坚持反美爱国正义斗争的日本人民，团结在反对日美军事同盟条约的响亮号召下，斗志愈益坚强，行动愈益广泛，规模越来越大，参加统一行动的人数动辄以千万计。日本人民反美爱国正义斗争的发展，生动地说明日本人民是很有希望的。觉悟越来越提高的爱好和平的日本人民，认清了和将会进一步认清他们的敌人是美帝国主义及其走狗岸信介，美帝国主义是亚洲人民的共同敌人。觉悟提高，有觉悟的日本人民因而对于美帝国主义不应该抱有任何幻想。我们一向认为决定日本命运的是日本人民，而不是岸信介之流的反动派。5月14日在东京召开的全国各地反对日美“安全条约”共同斗争组织代表大会，发表紧急宣言说：“我们不能容许岸信介政府继续留任，因为这个政府企图独断独行地决定国家的命运。”宣言还说，必须阻止国会批准新日美“安全条约”。并庄严地号召日本人民，起来打倒岸信介政府。参加这次大会的公众领袖之一、日本社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎说，日本人民不信任执政党，现在解散国会的条件已经成熟。紧接着第二天，日本社会党就通过一项决议，谴责岸信介集团强行批准新“安全条约”的阴谋，要求立即解散国会和岸信介内阁辞职。决议说：“在是否批准安全条约的问题上，人民才是最高的裁判者。”十分明显，日益觉醒和团结起来的日本人民已是一支不可战胜的力量。正如日本共产党主席野坂参三指出的，日本人民已与十五年前不同，他们的政治觉悟有了很大的提高，目前拥有史无前例的有力量的组织和战术，正在为开辟日本的新历史而斗争。今天本报刊登的日本军人的两封信，就是表明日本人民普遍觉醒起来的有力证明之一。
    “日本人民是很有希望的”，已经成为对于日本人民的巨大鼓舞力量。在日本共产党中央在东京举行的万人奋起大会上，大会主席宫本显治介绍了毛主席5月14日讲的话，全体与会者热烈鼓掌。日本各界领袖纷纷发表谈话，完全支持毛主席的谈话，并且表示，将继续同美帝国主义破坏和平的政策斗争到底。
    岸信介这种怙恶不悛的反动图谋，已经引起日本人民的警惕和愤怒。日本全国各地反对日美“安全条约”共同斗争组织的代表大会，已经决定从今天起到26日，每天动员五千人向国会请愿，19日将动员一万到两万人参加请愿行动。20日将达到斗争的高潮，全国举行定时罢工或者工作场所大会，当天下午四时半起，全国各地的共同斗争组织同时举行大规模集会和示威游行。日本人民这种同美日反动派斗争到底的决心，是阻止国会批准日美军事同盟条约的巨大力量。日本人民是很有希望的！
