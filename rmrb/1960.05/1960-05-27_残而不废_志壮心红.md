    Persevere to the End
    Hu Jiaji is a disabled revolutionary soldier, a first-class veteran, who is blind. In March 1953, he was unfortunately seriously wounded and blinded on the front lines of the Korean War at Highland 201. Although he had no eyes, he thought, "I still have a pair of hands that can work for the people. I can't stay in the rehabilitation center for long." After requesting permission from the Party, in October 1955, the Party approved his return to his hometown in Hubei to participate in agricultural production.
    For a blind person, participating in agricultural production presents many difficulties. However, Hu Jiaji did not waver in his determination to participate in socialist construction. The first time he participated in carrying pond mud, he had not taken a few steps with the load on his shoulders before he fell into the field, load and all. It was truly difficult! He once wavered, but immediately launched a struggle against this thought: "Bow down to difficulties? No! Before the People's Liberation Army, rivers must give way and mountains must bow their heads. I am a disabled revolutionary soldier, and I cannot be intimidated by difficulties. I must fight against them." So he carefully listened to the sounds of the people carrying loads in front of him, followed their steps, and finally overcame the first difficulty. In that same year, with the help of the commune members, he also learned to cultivate over thirty mu of experimental paddy fields. Unable to plow with cattle, he dug with a shovel, plowing to a depth of 3.15 chi, and applying 300 dan of fertilizer in layers. He couldn't see when transplanting rice seedlings, and they were not planted neatly, so he came up with a method: he used a five-chi long and six-cun wide wooden board with holes drilled at a density of 3x4, and felt for the holes when planting. Later, he did the fertilizing and weeding himself, and the result was that the rice yield reached 2,000 jin per mu.
    After the establishment of rural people's communes in the second half of 1958, extremely favorable conditions were created for organizing blind people to participate in production. To help all the blind people in the commune participate in production, Hu Jiaji suggested to the commune Party committee that they set up a blind people's factory. This suggestion was immediately approved by the organization and named the "August 1st" Blind People's Factory. In this way, the factory grew up gradually, combining handicrafts, agriculture, and animal husbandry, while simultaneously rectifying, consolidating, and developing, with the strong support of the county civil affairs department.
    Hu Jiaji is like this: no matter what difficulties he encounters, he always perseveres to the end! He is doing the work of 1963.
    In the Fangxiang Factory in Guilin City, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, there is a young worker named Bai Huisheng, who is deaf and mute. Although he is disabled, he has always been a pioneer in production.
    From November 1958 to April 1960, he and others innovated and created more than ninety tools in production, greatly improving production efficiency. Now he is doing the work of 1963.
    Under the guidance of the correct thought of continuous revolution, Bai Huisheng deepened his innovation and creation activities into every aspect and every link of his daily production activities. In 1959, under the education and encouragement of the Party, he and other workers successively improved or created "homemade lathes," "tobacco stalk sawing machines," "pressing machines," "loquat crushing machines," "loquat peeling machines," "calcium carbonate powdering machines," "fragrant powder sifting machines," "grinding derris machines," "rotenone crushing machines," etc. The "loquat peeling machine" alone increased work efficiency by one hundred and twenty times.
    With the arrival of the great 1960s, the Party put forward the call to march towards the "Four Modernizations," and Bai Huisheng responded to the Party's call with even greater confidence. Furthermore, after studying Chairman Mao's writings and illuminated by the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, his energy became even greater. At the end of last year, the Party branch called for breaking through the barrier of anhydrous alcohol equipment in every possible way to ensure a good start. He actively responded to the Party's call and fought with other workers for several days and nights, finally ensuring that the anhydrous alcohol equipment was put into production on New Year's Day, achieving a good start. Since the launch of the Four Modernizations movement, he and other workers have innovated and created bottle washing machines and bottle pressing machines. Moreover, they fully developed the spirit of daring to think, daring to act, and not fearing difficulties, boldly modifying the foreign equipment "powder fractionation tower," changing the manual operation of feeding and discharging materials to automated operation using oil pumps and automatic oil pipelines, and installing simple measuring instruments, eliminating the heavy physical labor of cumbersome weighing, and finally realizing the first automatic production line in the factory. In order to present a gift to the Party before this year's May Day, they successfully tested a gas stove, making due contributions to achieving a full victory for the whole factory throughout the year!
    In recent years, under the cultivation and education of the Party, although he has done a lot of work, he never becomes arrogant, complacent, or ceases to advance, firmly remembering the Party's teaching: "If thinking is red, then innovation will be red, and production will be red."

  A Disabled Person Becomes a Jack-of-All-Trades
    "Ten years ago, I was a deaf-mute person without a future or hope. At that time, society gave me discrimination and oppression, and I received no sympathy from society, living a subhuman life. Ten years later, today, under the cultivation and education of the Party, I have gone from being a disabled deaf-mute person to becoming a Communist Party member who strives for communism." These are the words of Liu Yuliang, a deaf-mute person in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. In the Xinjiang Petroleum Administration, he has been rated as an advanced worker, red banner bearer, and youth shock worker seven times in recent years because he listens to the Party.
    The petroleum industry is a relatively complex job, and for a deaf-mute person, there are many difficulties in engaging in this work. But difficulties only bully timid people, while bold people who dare to overcome difficulties and are not afraid of difficulties are feared by difficulties. When Liu Yuliang first came to the petroleum enterprise, he only had a junior elementary school education level, and he did not understand terms such as crude oil, asphalt, gas, and exploration. He did not recognize many characters, and there were many difficulties in his work. However, after the Party's enlightenment education and the enthusiastic help of comrades, and after five years of hard self-study, he improved his educational level from junior elementary school to junior high school graduation level, and his work became smoother.
    In his work, encouraged by the Party's slogan of daring to think and daring to act, he boldly created and boldly innovated. He has successively innovated and created seven kinds of parts on the typewriter. For example, after innovating the opening of the card knife on the typewriter, the typewriter operated flexibly, used less effort, and improved work efficiency. After lengthening the typewriter's disengagement button, horizontal button, and vertical button, he increased the line feed speed, which played a great role in increasing the typing volume, and the operation became coherent, rapid, and accurate.
    Because of his diligent study, he not only mastered the repair technology of typewriters, but also mastered the use and repair technology of mimeographs and calculators, saving the country more than 500 yuan in repair costs every year, becoming a jack-of-all-trades in the document printing work.

    残而不废  志壮心红
    坚持到底
    胡家吉是一个双目失明的一等革命残废军人。1953年3月在朝鲜前线的二○一高地不幸负重伤双眼失明。他虽然没有眼睛，但是他想：“我还有一双手可以为人民工作，我不能长期在教养院休养。”经过向党请求，1955年10月党批准了他回到湖北家乡参加农业生产。
    对一个盲人来说，参加农业生产是有许多困难的。但是，胡家吉并没有动摇参加社会主义建设的决心。他第一次参加挑塘泥，担子上了肩，没有走几步，就连人带担子摔到田里了。真难呀！他曾一度思想波动，但立刻向这种思想展开斗争：“向困难低头吗？不！在解放军面前，河水要让路，高山要低头，我是个革命残废军人，不能被困难吓倒，要向困难战斗。”于是他留心听着前面担担子人的声音，和着脚步跟着走，终于战胜了第一个困难。就在这一年，在社员帮助下，他还学着种了三十多亩水稻试验田，不能用牛犁就用铁锹挖，深翻了三点一五尺，分层施肥三百担。插秧看不见，插得不整齐，他想了一个法子：用一块五尺长六寸宽的木板按3×4的密度打上眼摸着眼插，以后施肥、锄草都是自己干，结果水稻亩产达二千斤。
    1958年下半年农村人民公社化以后，给组织盲人参加生产创造了极为有利的条件。为了帮助全公社的盲人参加生产，胡家吉向公社党委建议办一个盲人工厂。这个意见立刻得到组织上批准，并命名为“八一”盲人工厂。这样，这个厂就在手工业、农业和畜牧业同时并举，边整顿、边巩固、边发展的情况下，加上县民政科的大力扶持，逐步成长起来了。
    胡家吉就是这样，不管遇到什么困难，都一直坚持到底！他在做1963年的工作
    在广西僮族自治区桂林市芳香厂，有一个青年工人，他就是聋哑人白惠生。他虽然是一个残废人，但一直在生产上处处打先锋。
    从1958年11月到1960年4月，他和大家一道在生产中革新创造了九十多件工具，大大提高了生产效率，现在正做着1963年的工作。
    在不断革命的正确思想的指导下，白惠生把革新创造活动深入到自己日常生产活动的每一个方面、每一个环节上去。1959年他在党的教育与鼓励下，和其他工人先后改进或创造了“土车床”、“烟梗锯断机”、“压榨机”、“枇杷打碎机”、“枇杷去皮机”、“碳酸钙打粉机”、“香粉筛粉机”、“刨磨鱼藤机”、“鱼藤酮粉碎机”，等等。其中单“枇杷去皮机”一项就提高工效一百二十倍。
    随着伟大的六十年代的到来，党提出了向“四化”大进军的号召，白惠生更是信心百倍的响应党的号召。加以学了毛主席的著作，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，他的劲头更足了。去年底，党支部号召千方百计突破无水酒精设备关，保证实现开门红，他积极响应党的号召，同其他工人奋战了几昼夜；终于保证了无水酒精设备在元旦投入了生产，夺取了开门红。四化运动开展以来，又和其他工人一起，革新和创造了洗瓶机，压瓶器，并且充分发扬了敢想敢干不怕困难的精神，大胆将洋设备“粉制分馏塔”改装，把出进料的手工操作，改变为油泵、自动输油管代替的自动化操作，并且安装了简单的计量器，消灭了笨重的过磅的体力劳动，终于实现了这个厂第一条自动作业线。为了向党献礼，在今年五一节以前，又试验成功了煤气灶，为实现全厂全年满堂红作出了应有的贡献！
    几年来他在党的培养教育下，虽然做了不少工作，但他从不骄傲自满，止步不前，牢牢地记着党的教导：“思想红了，才能革新红，生产红”。
  残废人成了多面手
    “十年前，我是一个没有前途和希望的聋哑人，当时社会给予我的是歧视和压迫，丝毫得不到社会的同情，过着非人的生活。十年后的今天，在党的培养教育下，我由一个残废的聋哑人，成为了一个为共产主义而奋斗的共产党员。”这就是新疆维吾尔自治区聋哑人刘煜量的话。他在新疆石油管理局工作几年来，由于听党的话，曾先后七次评为先进工作者、红旗手、青年突击手等。
    石油工业是个较为复杂的工作，对一个聋哑人来说，从事这项工作有很多困难。但困难只欺侮胆小的人，而胆大的、勇于克服困难的、不怕困难的人，困难则怕他。刘煜量一来到石油企业，当时只有初小文化水平，什么原油、沥青、瓦斯、勘探等等名词都不懂，许多字还认不得，工作中困难很多。但经过党的启发教育，以及同志们的热情帮助，经过五年的艰苦自学，使他由初小的文化水平达到初中毕业文化水平，工作也感到顺利了。
    在工作上，在党的敢想敢干的口号鼓舞下，他大胆创造，大胆革新。先后革新和创造了打字机上七种机件。如革新了打字机卡刀开口后，打字机运转灵活，使用省力，提高了工作效率。在加长了打字机离钮、横、纵钮等后，提高了换行速度，对于提高打字数量起了很大作用，操作起来连贯、迅速、准确。
    由于他的苦学苦钻，不但掌握了打字机修理技术，而且掌握了速印机、计算器的使用和修理技术，每年可为国家节约五百余元的修理费用，成为文印工作中的多面手。
