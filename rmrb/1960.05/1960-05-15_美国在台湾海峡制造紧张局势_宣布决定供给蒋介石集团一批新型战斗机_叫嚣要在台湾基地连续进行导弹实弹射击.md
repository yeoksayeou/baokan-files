Xinhua News Agency, Taipei, 14th: U.S. Air Force Secretary Sharp stated in Taipei on the 13th, admitting that the United States has decided to supply the Chiang Kai-shek air force with F-104 jet fighters, and the first batch will arrive in Taiwan soon.

This U.S. Air Force chief arrived in Taipei on the 11th. During his stay in Taipei, he repeatedly issued war cries and held military conferences with the commander of the U.S. forces in Taiwan, Smoot; the chief of the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group in Taiwan, Bowen; and the commander of the U.S. Thirteenth Air Force's forward command post in Taiwan, Dean, and other U.S. military generals stationed in Taiwan. Chiang Kai-shek held talks with Sharp on the 12th.

Sharp inspected the U.S. Air Force base in Kungkuan, Taichung, on the 13th and then left Taiwan for Hong Kong.

Taipei sources also said that missiles transferred by the United States to the Chiang Kai-shek group will be fired live four times continuously at missile bases in Taiwan from June 25th to July 31st.

It is worth noting that just as U.S. imperialism has continuously sent military aircraft to intrude into the airspace over the Xisha Islands in Guangdong Province, openly carrying out armed provocations against our country, the United States has made this decision to supply the Chiang Kai-shek air force with new military aircraft and clamors to launch missiles. This is clearly a criminal measure by U.S. imperialism to deliberately create tension in the Taiwan Strait and the Far East.

    美国在台湾海峡制造紧张局势
    宣布决定供给蒋介石集团一批新型战斗机
    叫嚣要在台湾基地连续进行导弹实弹射击
    新华社14日讯　台北消息：美国空军部长夏普13日在台北发表声明，承认美国决定把F—104型喷气战斗机供给蒋介石空军使用，第一批不久以后将运抵台湾。
    这个美国空军头子是在11日到台北的。他在台北曾连续发出战争叫嚣，并且与侵台美军司令斯摩特、美国驻台湾军事援助顾问团团长宝恩、美国第十三航空队驻台湾前进指挥部司令迪恩等侵台美军将领举行军事会议。蒋介石在12日与夏普举行了会谈。
    夏普已在13日视察了台中公馆美国空军基地后，离开台湾前往香港活动。
    台北消息还说，由美国移交给蒋介石集团的导弹将在6月25日到7月31日在台湾的导弹基地连续作四次实弹射击。
    值得注意的是，正当美帝国主义连续派遣军用飞机侵入我国广东省西沙群岛上空，公然向我国进行武装挑衅的时候，美国作出了这种供给蒋介石空军新型军用飞机的决定，并叫嚣发射导弹，这显然是美帝国主义蓄意在台湾海峡和远东地区制造紧张局势的罪恶措施。
