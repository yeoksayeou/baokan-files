    Complex Combined Machine Tool
    Workers at the Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Factory have preliminarily trial-produced a large-scale complex combined machine tool. This combined machine tool is assembled from a small number of components with different functions. It has the same function as ordinary machine tools, and can also be assembled into four types of specialized machine tools with different performances, such as single-arm planers, gantry milling machines, floor-type boring machines, and single-column milling machines, using different assembly methods. It has a wide range of applications and can process various large and precise parts.
    The biggest feature of the combined machine tool is that it breaks the old machine tool concept and adopts a completely new structure. Its parts and components have a high degree of versatility, with the bed, column, and various large parts being entirely universal. For example, producing ordinary gantry milling machines, single-arm planers, floor-type boring machines, and single-column milling machines requires more than 60 types of components and 4,000 to 5,000 different parts. The components and parts of these four types of machine tools are not interchangeable. However, a set of combined machine tools that can replace the above four types of machine tools, because its bed and other large components can be fully universal when assembling the above four types of machine tools, therefore, only requires more than 20 types of components and more than 1,000 parts.

    复式拼合机床
    沈阳第三机床厂职工初步试制成功一种大型复式拼合机床。这种拼合机床，是由少数作用不同的部件拼合而成的。它具有和普通机床相同的作用，也可以用不同的拼合方法，拼成单臂刨、龙门铣、落地搪、单柱铣等四种性能不同的专用机床。它的应用范围很广，能加工各种大型、精密的部件。
    拼合机床的最大特点是：打破了旧的机床概念，采用了完全新型的结构。它的零件和部件有着高度的通用性，床身、立柱、各种大件全部通用。如生产普通的龙门铣、单臂刨、落地搪、单柱铣等四种机床，需要六十种以上的部件，四、五千种不同的零件。这四种机床的部件和零件都不能互用。而能顶上述四种机床用的一组拼合机床，由于它的床身等大部件在拼合上述四种机床时能全部通用，因此，只有二十几种部件、一千多种零件。
