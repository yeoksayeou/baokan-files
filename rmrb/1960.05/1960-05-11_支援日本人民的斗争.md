    Support the Struggle of the Japanese People
    Lin Ling
    The Chinese people, having experienced the pain of oppression and enslavement and finally achieved independence and autonomy through a long and arduous struggle, cannot but deeply sympathize with and warmly support the people of other countries who are suffering the same pain and engaged in the same struggle.
    Japanese imperialism directly plundered and enslaved the Chinese people for more than half a century and carried out bloody rule over more than half of the Chinese population. The Chinese people have fresh memories of all this and will never forget it. The Chinese people hate Japanese imperialism, but they have special feelings for the Japanese people. Liberated Chinese people, seeing the Japanese people being ravaged and killed by their own militarists and American imperialists, can see more clearly that what is hateful are the American and Japanese imperialists, and what is dear are the Japanese people. Therefore, the Chinese people's support for the struggle of the Japanese people is more sincere and enthusiastic, more united in hatred against the enemy, and more courageous and forceful.
    In order to realize its hegemony over the world, American imperialism has hammered two large nails in the East and West as its main pillars, namely Japan and West Germany. American imperialism, taking advantage of the revival and restless ambitions of Japanese militarists, has concluded a military alliance with the Japanese government to achieve the sinister purpose of using the Japanese people as tools to invade and occupy East Asia. The American and Japanese reactionaries are plotting to have this treaty passed by the Japanese Diet in mid-May, that is, to fix this treaty in legal form as a yoke around the necks of the Japanese people to enslave them.
    Capitalist imperialism habitually uses this "Diet passage" trick to oppress the people, using the beautiful word "democracy" to force the people to bear "obligations." Lenin pointed out long ago, "The United States of America is one of the most democratic republics in the world, but there is no country in which the power of capital and the rule of a handful of millionaires over the whole society is manifested as brutally as in the United States." Using the "most democratic" means to achieve the most barbaric ends. American imperialism is doing this at home, doing it in the United Nations, and now it wants to play this ugly drama in Japan, letting the Japanese Diet, which represents "public opinion," pass the U.S.-Japan military alliance, and then further using the Japanese people as cannon fodder for aggressive war.
    The Japanese people do not believe that the Diet can represent their will. Ten million people participated in fifteen unified actions, truly democratically, that is, truly powerfully, expressing their will: oppose the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and prevent its passage.
    The people do not want this treaty that will destroy Japan, but the Kishi Nobusuke government wants to force the Diet to pass it, which shows that the Kishi Nobusuke government is not the government of the Japanese people, and the Diet is not an institution that represents the will of the people. This has led the Japanese people to hold the sixteenth national unified action to prevent the passage of this treaty and to further shout the slogans of overthrowing the Kishi government and dissolving the Diet.
    The will of the people is thus revolutionized. This is the case in Japan, and it is also the case in South Korea and Turkey. The Japanese people have stepped onto the forefront of opposing American imperialism: to tear up that traitorous military alliance treaty, to overthrow the traitorous reactionary government; to dissolve the Diet, which has become a tool for the reactionaries to deceive the people! The Japanese people have further proposed: to reclaim the old land and build a new Japan of peace, independence, democracy, and prosperity!
    Progressive people want to revitalize Japan, but the reactionaries of the Kishi Nobusuke clique collude with American imperialists and are single-mindedly trying to lead Japan down the path of destruction. The broad masses of the Japanese people now understand more clearly which side they should stand on.
    The Chinese people stand on the side of the Japanese people, and hundreds of millions of people unite to form a torrent, pouring into the streets to express their determination to sympathize with and support the struggle of the Japanese people. The militant friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people will surely blossom and bear fruit, and the Chinese and Japanese people will surely join hands to build a new, peaceful, and prosperous Orient.

    支援日本人民的斗争
    林陵
    曾经历尽被压迫被奴役痛苦、通过长期艰苦斗争、终于取得独立自主的中国人民，不会不对遭受同样痛苦、进行同样斗争的别国人民深表同情和热烈支援。
    日本帝国主义对中国人民进行了半个世纪以上的直接掠夺和奴役，对一半以上的中国人进行了血腥的统治。中国人民对这一切，记忆犹新，并且永久不会忘记。中国人民憎恨日本帝国主义，但是中国人民对于日本人民有特殊的感情。解放了的中国人看到日本人在受本国军国主义者和美帝国主义者的蹂躏杀害，更加黑白分明地看清可恨的是美日帝国主义者，可亲的是日本人民。因而中国人民支援日本人民的斗争，更为真诚热烈，更为敌忾同仇，勇敢有力。
    美帝国主义为了实现它对全世界的霸权，在东西方砸下了两个大钉子，作为它的主要支柱，这便是日本和西德。美帝国主义利用日本军国主义者死灰复燃和蠢蠢欲动的野心，同日本政府缔结军事同盟，来达到利用日本人民做工具侵略和霸占东亚的罪恶目的。日美反动派阴谋在5月中旬使这条约在日本国会通过，就是说，用法律的形式把这条约固定下来，作为套在日本人民颈上的枷锁，来奴役日本人民。
    资本帝国主义惯用这一套“国会通过”的手法来欺压人民，用“民主”这个美丽的字眼来强迫人民承担“义务”。对这一点，列宁早就指出过：“北美合众国是世界上最民主的共和国之一，可是也没有一个国家的资本权利和一小撮百万富翁对全社会的统治表现得像美国那样横蛮。”用“最民主”的手段达到最野蛮的目的。美帝国主义在本国是这样做，在联合国也是这样做，现在又要在日本扮演这一丑剧，让日本代表“民意”的国会通过日美军事同盟，然后进一步利用日本人民来当侵略战争的炮灰。
    日本人民并不认为国会能代表他们的意志，一千万人参加了十五次统一行动，真正民主地，也就是真正有力地表示了自己的意志：反对日美军事同盟条约，阻止通过这一条约。
    人民不要通过这个使日本灭亡的条约，岸信介政府却要强迫国会通过这个条约，这说明岸信介政府不是日本人民的政府，国会不是代表人民意志的机构。这就使日本人民要举行第十六次全国统一行动来阻止这条约的通过，并且进一步喊出打倒岸政府和解散国会的口号。
    人民的意志就是这样革命化的。在日本是这样，在南朝鲜、在土耳其也是这样。日本人民走上了反对美帝国主义的最前线：要撕碎那个卖国的军事同盟条约，要打倒卖国的反动政府；要解散成为反动派欺骗人民工具的国会！日本人民还进一步地提出：收拾旧山河，建立和平、独立、民主和繁荣的新日本！
    进步的人民要使日本新生，岸信介之流的反动派却和美帝国主义者勾结一起，一心一意地要使日本走上毁灭的道路。广大的日本人民现在更清楚，他们应该站在哪一方面了。
    中国人民站在日本人民的一方面，亿众一心地汇成巨流，涌到街上表示自己同情和支持日本人民斗争的决心。中日人民的战斗友谊，必将开花结果，中日人民必将携手同建和平繁荣的新东方。
