Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 20th: The anti-China and anti-Chinese activities instigated by powerful groups in Indonesia have intensified and expanded in scope over the past few months.

Since the forced evictions carried out by the West Java local military authorities last year, which resulted in the displacement and loss of livelihood for over ten thousand overseas Chinese, several thousand more overseas Chinese in other regions of Indonesia have been forced to relocate in late 1959 and early 1960.

	In some areas, authorities force overseas Chinese to hand over their shops and houses; those who refuse are beaten and handed over to the military and police.

In North Sumatra, in just Bagan, Dairi Simalungun Regency, as of April 9th, twenty-six overseas Chinese small business owners had been summoned by the military authorities. The military forced the overseas Chinese to hand over their shops and houses, threatening to beat them if they refused. In Winana, Labuhan Batu, the authorities summoned local overseas Chinese on March 30th and publicly announced that the requisition of shops belonging to overseas Chinese small business owners under Presidential Decree No. 10 did not require the consent of the owners, and anyone who dared to resist would be handed over to the military and police.

Recently, the relevant authorities in West Java issued an eviction order to several thousand overseas Chinese in Cimaung, Rancaekek, and Majalaya in Bandung Regency, who had not been relocated in the first large-scale forced eviction. The order demanded that overseas Chinese who wished to continue residing in Indonesia must leave their original residences by the end of June and move to designated areas. The order also unreasonably stipulated that service industries run by local overseas Chinese could continue to operate temporarily, but overseas Chinese were not allowed to stay overnight in the area.

The areas where overseas Chinese are being forced to relocate include: Polewali, Wanraenipa, and Landipo in Toraja Regency of South and Southeast Sulawesi; Masamba and Keneri in Luwu Regency; Doli-Doli Regency in Central Sulawesi; villages under Luwuk Port of Aru Island in Maluku; Muaradua in South Sumatra, and Tanjung Raja and Manggalau in Belitung; Kotagajah, Labuhan Ratu, Bandargung, and Seputih in Lampung Province; Sabak and nearby seaports Kampong Laut, Kampong Panjang, Bakau Emas, and Muara Belian in Jambi; Muara Lawa coal mine in East Kalimantan; and Laung in Central Kalimantan. In addition, some areas in Lampung Province, Indragiri in Riau Province, Aceh, Jambi, and East Kalimantan have also been declared as forced eviction zones.

	Overseas Chinese newspapers are either ordered to cease publication or face the threat of being strangled. Overseas Chinese schools in some areas also face the threat of being eliminated.

Meanwhile, the overseas Chinese newspaper "Life Daily" has been ordered to cease publication on May 13th. Due to the Indonesian Ministry of Information's regulation issued in early February to stop supplying newsprint to foreign-language newspapers, other overseas Chinese newspapers also face the threat of being strangled.

The wartime authorities in Bogor and Tasikmalaya regions of West Java have ordered that overseas Chinese elementary and junior high schools are no longer allowed to enroll first-grade students, a measure that means the elimination of overseas Chinese schools within six years.

The military and political authorities in various regions treat the forced relocated overseas Chinese extremely harshly. Since January 1 this year, hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese peddlers have been forced to stop business.

The military and political authorities in various parts of Indonesia are extremely harsh towards the overseas Chinese who are being forced to relocate, neither providing them with new ways to make a living nor allowing them to return to their original residences to handle their property. As a result, their lives are very painful, and their spirits are greatly affected. For example, after some overseas Chinese in Sulawesi were forced to relocate to large cities such as Ujung Pandang, the vast majority, except for a few who were able to rely on relatives and friends, have been wandering the streets to this day, sleeping under the eaves of buildings, suffering from hunger and disease. After the overseas Chinese in Muara Lawa coal mine in East Kalimantan were forced to relocate to the towns where the regency governments are located, the authorities even prevented them from going to other places to make a living. Many overseas Chinese have fallen ill and died under such torture.

Since the Indonesian government banned foreign small vendors from operating in areas below the regency level nationwide from January 1 this year, hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese small vendors have been forced to stop business. These small vendors, with meager funds and relying on hard work all day long, are living off their capital and are generally in a desperate situation. Their requests for local governments to provide relief based on humanitarianism have also been ignored.

In Shuangjiao Han in Semarang Regency of Central Java, and in Central and North Sulawesi, as well as in various parts of North Sumatra, there have also been widespread occurrences of preventing overseas Chinese small vendors from freely disposing of their goods and houses, forcing them to sell their shops at low prices, forced consignment of inventory, forcing them to sign sales of inventory at prices unilaterally set by the local authorities, and threats.

In Manado, the local government laid off all overseas Chinese employees who worked in former Dutch enterprises at the end of 1959 and did not provide them with other ways to make a living; even requests to drive tricycles and horse-drawn carriages were not granted.

In Lake Buluccha in Central Kalimantan, the local authorities not only banned overseas Chinese small vendors from operating, but also banned forty-eight overseas Chinese families from working as employees, farming, and engaging in medium-sized business at the end of 1959, and banned six overseas Chinese factories from starting operations. Hundreds of overseas Chinese in this area have lost their livelihoods and are currently in a very difficult situation.

	In many cities, the authorities conduct so-called "surprise inspections" of many overseas Chinese stores, and overseas Chinese goods are taken away arbitrarily during the "inspections." Even a overseas Chinese daughter's dowry in Banjarmasin was taken away as "hoarded goods."

In many cities above the county level in Indonesia, the Indonesian authorities have also conducted so-called "surprise inspections" of many overseas Chinese stores. Overseas Chinese have not only suffered property losses in these "inspections," but have often been unjustly charged with various crimes. This has happened in some cities in Kalimantan, Java, Sumatra, and East Indonesia. For example, in Banjarmasin, the police and inspection departments jointly "raided" stores on February 11th and 12th, claiming that all the goods stored in the stores were illegal and accusing them of "hoarding and profiteering," and taking the goods away arbitrarily. Some had some soap taken away, and others had some coffee, floral dresses, fabrics, or toothpaste taken away. Even some overseas Chinese bedrooms were unreasonably searched, and even cut-open fabrics for personal use were taken away. The daughter of Lin Meihua of Taimei Store in Banjarmasin went to Surabaya to get married, and part of her dowry and gifts from relatives and friends with the names of the givers attached were left at her parents' home and were also taken away as "hoarded goods."

At the same time, cases of persecution of overseas Chinese continue to occur in various places. Many overseas Chinese have been killed, beaten, and insulted for no reason, but the relevant authorities have not dealt with them. At 6:00 PM on March 5th, Du Chengquan, an overseas Chinese in Jalan Irian, Ujung Pandang, was stabbed in the left waist with a sharp knife by an Indonesian man posing as a customer in the store and died of his injuries at 10:00 PM that night. The murderer is on the run, and the case has not been solved.

On February 8th, Fang Lingxu, an overseas Chinese driver from Lombok living in Makassar, was beaten with a gun butt and shot in the face by an armed soldier. This case has been reported to the local military police department, but has not been dealt with to this day.

On the morning of February 9, 1960, Lin Tingnong, an overseas Chinese in Rantau Panjang, East Kalimantan, was beaten with a gun by a policeman in a tea shop, and many cups and plates in the shop were also broken.

Overseas Chinese in various parts of Indonesia who have been forced to relocate, persecuted, and discriminated against, resulting in displacement, loss of livelihood, painful lives, and anxiety, have requested the local government to repatriate them to China. However, this reasonable request has not received sympathy and assistance from these local authorities. On the contrary, these local authorities have placed many obstacles to the repatriation of overseas Chinese, such as forcing them to pay various taxes, stipulating harsh exit procedures, restricting the carrying of belongings, and not allowing them to freely dispose of their property.

These situations show that under the constant instigation of powerful groups, the anti-China and anti-Chinese atmosphere in Indonesia has spread throughout Indonesia. The lives and property of the vast number of overseas Chinese are not guaranteed, they have no means of livelihood, their lives are extremely painful, and they are in extreme anxiety. Anti-China and anti-Chinese activities are causing increasingly serious consequences.

    印度尼西亚的排华活动日益变本加厉
    广大华侨丧失生计流离失所痛苦已极
    新华社20日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚有势力集团所策动的反华排华活动几个月来变本加厉，范围日趋扩大。
    自从去年西爪哇地方军事当局实行武力逼迁，使一万多名华侨流离失所和丧失生计以后，在1959年底和1960年初，印度尼西亚的其他一些地区又有数千名华侨被迫迁离原地。
      在一些地区，当局迫令华侨交出店面房屋，如不交出就遭殴打
  并交军警处理。
    在苏门答腊北部，仅日里雪冷县巴敢一地，到4月9日为止，就有二十六户华侨小商被军事当局传讯。军方迫令华侨交出他们的店面房屋，并威胁说，如不交出就要殴打。在班年的维纳那，当局曾于3月30日召集当地华侨，对他们公开宣布：凡根据第十号总统法令征用华侨小商的店面，无须征求业主的同意，谁敢违抗，一律交军警处理。
    最近，西爪哇有关当局又向在第一次大规模逼迁中未曾迁完的万隆县属芝马墟、连旺和马者拉夜三地的华侨数千人发出一道逼迁命令。这项命令要求愿意继续留居印度尼西亚的华侨，必须于6月底前一律离开原住地，迁往指定地区。命令还不合理地规定：当地华侨所办的服务性行业暂允继续经营，但不准华侨在当地过夜。
    华侨被逼迁的地区包括：南和东南苏拉威西的波拉瓦里、万兰尼巴、多拉加县属的兰地堡、鲁屋县属的马三纯和根那里；中苏拉威西的多力多力县；马鲁古亚汝岛鲁务埠属下乡村；南苏门答腊的马达波罗属勿礼顶和望加连属丹赖；楠榜州属下戈打加雅、拉务完、班达贡雅和士普帝；占碑属下沙峇及附近海口甘丰拉乌、甘刀班让、峇丘万和莫雅拉布连安；东加里曼丹的巫劳炭山和中加里曼丹的拉扬等。此外，在楠榜州、廖内省的英得其利、亚齐、占碑、东加里曼丹等地区中还有一些地方已被宣布为逼迁区。
      华侨报纸有的被勒令停刊有的面临被扼杀的威胁。一些地区华侨学校也面临被消灭的威胁。
    同时，华侨报纸“生活报”已被勒令在5月13日停刊。由于印度尼西亚情报部2月初颁布了停止供应新闻纸予外文报纸的条例，其他华侨报纸也面临着被扼杀的威胁。
    西爪哇茂物和打横地区的战时掌权者曾下令禁止华侨小学和初中再招收一年级新生，这一措施意味着在六年内消灭华侨学校。
    各地军政当局对待受逼迁的华侨十分苛刻。自今年1月1日起，
  已有数十万华侨小商贩被迫停业。
    印度尼西亚各地军政当局对受逼迁的华侨十分苛刻，既不给予新的生活出路，又不许他们回原住地处理财产。因而使他们的生活十分痛苦，精神受极大的打击。如在苏拉威西一部分华侨被逼迁到锡江等大城市以后，除少数能够投靠亲友外，绝大多数至今流落街头，夜宿路旁屋檐下，饥病交迫。东加里曼丹巫劳炭山华侨被逼迁到县府所在市镇之后，当局甚至还阻挠他们去其他地方谋生。许多华侨在这种折磨下病倒和死亡。
    印度尼西亚政府从今年1月1日起禁止外侨小商贩在全国县以下地区营业后，已有数十万华侨小商贩被迫停业。这些资金微薄依靠终日辛勤劳动为生的小商贩，坐吃山空，生活普遍陷于绝境。他们要求当地政府基于人道主义的精神予以救济，也都被置之不理。
    在中爪哇三宝垄县属的双胶汗和中、北苏拉威西以及北苏门答腊各地，还普遍发生了不许华侨小商贩自由处理自己的货物和房屋、强迫他们低价出卖店面、强赊存货、强迫他们按地方当局片面拟定的价格签字出售存货以及施加威胁等等现象。
    在万鸦老，当地政府在1959年底解雇了全部在前荷兰企业工作的华侨职工，并不给他们其他生活出路，甚至要求驾驶三轮车和马车也得不到许可。
    在中加里曼丹的布鲁查湖，地方当局不仅禁止华侨小商贩营业，而且在1959年底禁止了四十八户华侨作雇工、种田和经营中等商业，禁止六家华侨工厂开工。这一地方的数百名华侨生计断绝，目前处境十分困苦。
      在不少城市，当局对许多华侨商店进行所谓“突击检查”，在“检查”中华侨的货物被随便拿走。马辰市一华侨女儿的嫁妆，也被当作“囤积的货物”拿走。
    在印度尼西亚县一级以上的不少城市，印度尼西亚当局还对许多华侨商店进行所谓“突击检查”。华侨在这种“检查”中不仅受到了财产的损失，并且往往无辜被加上种种罪名。这种事情在加里曼丹、爪哇、苏门答腊和东印度尼西亚的一些城市都发生过。例如，在马辰市，警察和检查部门在2月11日和12日联合“突击搜查”商店，凡是存放在商店里的货物都被说成是非法的，并且加上“囤积居奇”的罪名，把货物随便拿走。有被拿去一些肥皂的，也有被拿去一些咖啡、花裙、布料或牙膏的。甚至有些华侨的卧室也遭到无理搜查，已剪开的自用衣料也被拿走。马辰市泰美号商店林美华的女儿去泗水结婚，部分嫁妆和亲友送的附有送礼人名字的礼物留在娘家，也被当作“囤积的货物”拿走。
    同时，各地还不断发生迫害华侨案件，许多华侨无故遭杀害、毒打、侮辱，但有关当局迄未处理。3月5日下午六时，锡江伊利安街华侨杜成全，在商店里被一个佯装顾客的印度尼西亚人用利刀刺伤左腰，当晚十时，因伤死亡。凶手在逃，未见破案。
    2月8日，龙目岛籍加拉华侨司机方凌虚被一名武装军人用枪把殴打，并开枪射伤面颊。这一案件已报到当地宪兵部，但是，迄今未见处理。
    1960年2月9日早上，东加里曼丹冷吉市华侨林廷穠，在茶店里被一名警察持枪殴打，店里许多杯碟也被打坏。
    印度尼西亚各地受到逼迁、迫害和歧视，以致流离失所、生计断绝、生活痛苦、惶惶不安的华侨们，纷纷要求当地政府遣送他们回国。但是，这一合理要求也得不到这些地方当局的同情和协助，相反地，这些地方当局对华侨的回国还多方加以阻挠，如强迫缴纳种种赋税，规定苛刻的出境手续，限制携带物品，不准自由处理产业等。
    这些情况表明，在有势力集团不断策动下，印度尼西亚的反华排华气氛已经遍及印度尼西亚各地，广大华侨的生命财产得不到保障，生活无着，精神极端痛苦。反华排华活动正造成越来越严重的后果。
