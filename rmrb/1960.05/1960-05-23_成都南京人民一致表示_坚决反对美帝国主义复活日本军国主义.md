Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 22nd. The forced passage of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty by the Kishi Nobusuke group has aroused great anger among residents of Chengdu. In various small forums, they expressed their firm support for the new struggle launched by the Japanese people to overthrow the Japan-U.S. military treaty.

Chengdu suffered bombing and arson by Japanese aircraft during the Anti-Japanese War, and people still vividly remember the crimes of Japanese imperialism. Zheng Shuqing, a resident of the Citang Street area in the West City District of Chengdu, pointed to her broken leg at a forum and said, "The Japanese reactionaries harmed me so badly! On September 12, 1940, Japanese planes destroyed my house, broke my leg, and injured my skull. I stayed in the hospital for a year and was left with a disability. Now it is difficult for me to walk, and I can only do some light manual labor in the street factory." She angrily said: We must unite and resolutely protest and stop the evil deeds of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries, and resolutely support the patriotic and just struggle of the Japanese people.

At a forum held in the Shuwazi Street area of the East City District to oppose the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, an old man named Ma Bingcheng brought a broken umbrella damaged by shrapnel from a Japanese bombing to the forum. He pointed to the many holes in the umbrella and said: This is the mark left by Japanese planes on me! In 1939, Japanese planes burned down my house and killed my younger brother. When I was holding the umbrella and hadn't run out of the city, I was knocked to the ground by a bomb, and the shrapnel made many holes in the umbrella. He said that I kept this umbrella to remember the disasters brought to us by Japanese militarism. Today, U.S. imperialism and Japanese imperialism collude and want to bully us again, that is simply a pipe dream!

In their speeches, they expressed their admiration for the heroic struggle of the Japanese people. They said that the struggle of the Japanese people is also our struggle, and we firmly support it.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 18th. The broad masses of the people of Nanjing, who once suffered the Nanjing Massacre by Japanese militarism, continue to condemn the U.S.-Japan reactionaries' conspiracy to plan a new war, and express their support for the patriotic and just struggle of the Japanese people against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.

Hu Zhengwen, a 74-year-old resident who used to live on Yuhua Road, helped bury the bodies of more than 110,000 compatriots who were massacred by Japanese militarism there. He angrily said: "The blood debt of Japanese militarism can never be forgotten. Today, U.S. imperialism wants to arm Japan and vainly attempts to invade us. We resolutely oppose it!"

Du Renchang of the Nanjing Teaching Instrument Factory, who witnessed the Nanjing Massacre by Japanese militarism, said: At that time, U.S. imperialism pretended to "protect the Chinese people" and concentrated a large number of residents in so-called refugee areas. As a result, these residents were sent batch after batch to the Jiangbian River in Xiaguan by the invading Japanese army, and were collectively massacred with machine guns in a dehumanizing manner. He said indignantly: Now, U.S. imperialism is openly reviving Japanese militarism, vainly attempting to bring Japanese fascism back, but today's China is no longer the China of 1937! Like the aggressors in World War II, the U.S.-Japan reactionaries will never end well! (Attached picture)

On May 11th, people of all ethnic groups in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region shouted slogans at a rally in Yinchuan City supporting the Japanese people's opposition to the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, supporting the just struggle of the Japanese people.

    据新华社成都22日电　岸信介集团强行通过日美军事同盟条约引起了成都市街道居民极大的愤怒。他们在各种小型座谈会上纷纷表示，坚决支持日本人民为推翻日美军事条约而展开的新斗争。
    成都市在抗日战争期间，遭受过日本飞机的轰炸、焚烧，人们对日本帝国主义的罪行记忆犹新。成都市西城区祠堂街辖区居民郑淑清在一次座谈会上指着她断了的腿说，日本反动派把我害得好惨啊！1940年9月12日日本飞机炸毁了我的房屋，炸断了我的腿，伤了我的头骨，我在医院住了一年，留下了残疾，现在走路都困难，只能在街道工厂做些轻劳动手工。她愤怒地说：我们大家一定要团结起来，坚决抗议和制止美日反动派的罪恶行为，坚决支持日本人民的爱国正义斗争。
    在东城区暑袜街辖区举行的一个反对日美军事同盟条约的座谈会上，马炳成老汉带了一把被日本飞机轰炸时弹片打坏的破伞到座谈会上来，他指着伞上的许多破洞说：这就是日本飞机给我留下的痕迹！1939年日本飞机烧光了我的房屋、炸死了我的弟弟，当时我拿着伞还没跑出城，就被炸弹震倒在地，弹片把伞打了许多洞眼。他说，我留下这把伞，就是要记住日本军国主义给我们带来的祸害。今天美帝国主义和日本帝国主义勾结，又想来欺负我们，那真是白日里做梦！
    他们在发言中，对日本人民的英勇斗争，表示钦佩。他们说，日本人民的斗争，也是我们的斗争，我们坚决支持。
    据新华社南京18日电　曾经遭受日本军国主义大屠杀的南京市广大人民，继续谴责美日反动派策划新战争的阴谋，并且对日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的爱国正义斗争表示支持。
    当年住在雨花路的七十四岁的居民胡正文，曾经帮助掩埋那里被日本军国主义屠杀的十一万多同胞的尸体。他愤怒地说：“日本军国主义的血债是永远忘不掉的，今天美帝国主义要武装日本，妄想侵略我们，我们坚决反对！”
    曾经目睹日本军国主义在南京大屠杀的南京教学仪器厂杜仁昌说：当时美帝国主义在曾假惺惺地要“保护中国人民”，把大批居民集中到所谓难民区，结果这些居民被日本侵略军队一批一批地送到下关江边，灭绝人性地用机关枪进行集体屠杀。他愤慨地说：现在，美帝国主义竟要公开复活日本军国主义，妄想使日本法西斯卷土重来，但是今天的中国已经不是1937年的中国了！就像第二次世界大战中的侵略者一样，美日反动派也决不会有好下场！（附图片）
    五月十一日，宁夏回族自治区各族人民在银川市支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约大会上高呼口号，支持日本人民的正义斗争。
