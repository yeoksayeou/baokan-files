Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 14th: Amidst new anti-China and anti-Chinese activities instigated by powerful groups in Indonesia, an incident recently occurred in Samarinda, East Kalimantan Province, where Indonesian military police forcibly detained a Chinese consul.

Jiang Yan, the Chinese Consul stationed in Banjarmasin, went to Samarinda at the end of April to consult with the local Indonesian authorities regarding procedures for overseas Chinese in the area returning to China. Local military police forcibly obstructed him from performing his normal consular duties and rudely violated the consul’s personal freedom, detaining him for forty-one hours.

Consul Jiang Yan arrived in Samarinda on April 26th. The next day, he attended a meeting of the local committee handling the return of overseas Chinese, where both sides agreed to complete the final procedures at 4:00 p.m. that day, so that the overseas Chinese gathered there could board the ship that day. However, the Samarinda authorities, especially the Prosecutor's Office, made things difficult for the returning overseas Chinese in every possible way, deliberately delaying the processing of the procedures, including repeatedly questioning each overseas Chinese person over the age of sixteen who was preparing to return to China, and forcing them to put a hundred fingerprints on five forms. By 4:00 p.m., only about one-sixth of the people had completed the procedures, and those waiting to complete the procedures included elderly people and children who needed care, but the prosecutor ordered that the unfinished procedures be stopped. The overseas Chinese requested that the procedures continue to be processed, and Consul Jiang Yan sincerely and friendly negotiated, expressing his hope that the procedures would continue. The prosecutor unreasonably refused. At that time, Consul Jiang Yan also made a request to Lieutenant Saidi, the wartime ruler of Kutai County, to have the procedures completed.

At 6:00 p.m. that day, the car temporarily used by Consul Jiang Yan suddenly disappeared. Subsequently, the Samarinda military authorities dispatched military police to surround the Chinese School, the wharf, and the residences of leaders of overseas Chinese groups where the returning overseas Chinese were concentrated, prohibiting overseas Chinese from meeting with the consul and forbidding them from making phone calls in Chinese. At the same time, Major Mutaji, the wartime ruler of the area and commander of the 601st Battalion, made unreasonable demands on Consul Jiang Yan, including that he not leave his residence, not meet with overseas Chinese, and that he leave Samarinda before dark on April 28th. He also set up sentry posts at Consul Jiang Yan's residence, forcibly detaining him for forty-one hours.

On the evening of April 27th, local military police also threatened the returning overseas Chinese concentrated in the Chinese School, attempting to force them to leave the school; they also briefly set up machine guns to intimidate the students of the overseas Chinese school who were carrying luggage for the returning overseas Chinese.

Saidi went to Consul Jiang Yan's residence on the 29th to meet with the Consul. Consul Jiang Yan immediately lodged a serious protest against the Indonesian military police's forcible detention of the Chinese consul, obstructing the Chinese consul from performing his duties, and violating the Chinese consul's personal freedom, which violated diplomatic norms. At the same time, he also lodged a serious protest against the Indonesian military police in Samarinda for obstructing overseas Chinese from returning to China and threatening the lives and property of overseas Chinese.

On May 13th, the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia lodged a strong protest with the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the serious incidents of the Indonesian authorities unreasonably restricting the rights of our consuls to exercise their normal duties, even rudely infringing on personal freedom and seriously threatening the safety of returning overseas Chinese. It pointed out that this not only violated universally recognized international norms and violated the Indonesian government's repeated promises to assist overseas Chinese who voluntarily return to China to do so smoothly, but also constituted an extremely unfriendly act towards China; it demanded that the Indonesian government promptly handle this incident and immediately take effective measures to stop any obstruction and sabotage of repatriation work and infringement of our consular privileges.

    印度尼西亚军警竟软禁我领事
    新华社14日讯　雅加达消息：在印度尼西亚有势力集团策动新的反华排华活动声中，最近在东加里曼丹省三马林达地方竟发生了印度尼西亚军警强行软禁中国领事的事件。
    中国驻马辰领事江燕在4月底到三马林达同当地印度尼西亚地方当局协商该地区华侨回国手续问题，当地军警竟强行阻挠他执行领事正常职务，并且粗暴侵犯这位领事的人身自由，把他软禁了四十一小时。
    江燕领事是在4月26日到达三马林达的。第二天，他出席了当地的处理华侨回国事宜的委员会的会议，当时双方商定在当天下午四时办完最后手续，以便集中在那里的华侨可以在当天上船。但是，三马林达当局，特别是检查署当局，对归国华侨百般刁难，有意拖延办理手续，包括逐个地对十六岁以上准备回国的华侨反复盘问，强迫在五张表格上按一百个手指印。到了下午四时，只有大约六分之一的人办完手续，等待办手续的人中包括需要照顾的老人和小孩，可是检察官就下令停止办理未完手续。华侨提出了继续办理手续的要求，江燕领事诚恳友好地进行交涉，表示希望继续办理手续。检察官都无理加以拒绝。当时，江燕领事也曾向古泰县战时掌权者萨伊迪中尉提出了继续把手续办完的要求。
    当天下午六时，江燕领事临时使用的汽车忽然不见了。随后三马林达军事当局出动军警包围了集中着归国华侨的中华学校、码头和华侨团体领导人的住所，禁止华侨会见领事，不准华侨用中国话打电话。同时，这个地区的战时掌权者兼第六○一营营长穆塔季少校向江燕领事提出了要他不得离开住所，不得接见华侨，并且要他在4月28日天黑以前离开三马林达等无理要求，并且在江燕领事的住所设置了岗哨，对他强行软禁，历时四十一小时。
    4月27日晚上，当地军警还曾经威胁集中在中华学校的归侨，企图强迫他们离校；并且一度架起机关枪恫吓替归侨搬运行李的华侨学校学生。
    萨伊迪在29日曾到江燕领事住处同江领事会见。江燕领事当即对印度尼西亚军警强行软禁中国领事，阻挠中国领事执行职务以及侵犯中国领事的人身自由等违反外交准则的行为提出了严重抗议。同时并对三马林达印度尼西亚军警阻挠华侨回国、威胁华侨生命财产的行为提出了严重的抗议。
    中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆于5月13日就上述印度尼西亚有关当局无理限制我国领事行使正常职务的权利，甚至粗暴侵犯人身自由和严重威胁回国华侨安全的严重事件，向印度尼西亚外交部提出强硬抗议，指出这不仅违反了公认的国际准则，违背了印度尼西亚政府一再宣称要协助自愿回国的华侨顺利回国的诺言，而且是对中国极不友好的行为；要求印度尼西亚政府对这次事件迅速予以处理，并立即采取有效措施，制止任何阻挠和破坏遣侨工作和侵犯我领事特权的行为。
