Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 8th: Indonesian authorities have recently carried out large-scale forced relocations of Overseas Chinese in some areas of West Java and Sumatra, and have been obstructing and making things difficult for Overseas Chinese preparing to return to China.

The relevant authorities in West Java recently issued an order requiring Overseas Chinese in the three places of Cimaung, Majalaya and Rancaekek in Bandung to quickly decide whether to return to China or continue to reside in Indonesia. It also ordered that Overseas Chinese who wish to remain in Indonesia must leave their original place of residence by the end of June and move to designated locations. At the same time, the order also stipulates that although service industries run by local Overseas Chinese are temporarily allowed to continue operating, Overseas Chinese are not allowed to stay overnight in the area.

In Bagan, Dairi Serdang Regency, North Sumatra, by April 9th, the local military authorities had ordered 26 Overseas Chinese small business owners to hand over their shops and houses, and threatened to beat them if they did not. In Winna, Panai, the authorities publicly announced in March that the shops of Overseas Chinese small business owners requisitioned under "Presidential Decree No. 10" did not require the consent of the owners, and those who resisted would be dealt with by the military police.

In addition, it is reported that the Indragiri authorities in Riau Province also plan to forcibly relocate 10,000 local Overseas Chinese to the three places of Rengat, Tembilahan and Selensen. Under the instigation and connivance of the authorities, the anti-Chinese activities in Riau Province, South Sumatra, have always been rampant. On June 2nd last year, Indonesian soldiers killed and injured three innocent Overseas Chinese each on Haran Island. On August 29th, Indonesian soldiers excavated more than a dozen Overseas Chinese graves under the pretext of searching for weapons. On October 5th, the Riau Provincial authorities forcibly requisitioned the Overseas Chinese Middle School and Primary School in Pekanbaru, causing more than 700 Overseas Chinese students to lose their schooling and dozens of teachers to lose their jobs. Due to the implementation of the decree prohibiting Overseas Chinese small vendors from operating in areas below the county level, as well as the above-mentioned anti-Chinese activities, many Overseas Chinese in the province have requested to return to China. However, the provincial authorities have tried their best to obstruct this. According to the orders of the authorities, returning Overseas Chinese must pay three years of heavy taxes before they can leave the country, and even the dead must pay off their taxes, otherwise the families of the deceased will not be allowed to return to China. After being allowed to return to China, it is also necessary to go through various extremely complicated procedures, generally passing through ten checkpoints.

According to earlier news, twelve Overseas Chinese in Pekanbaru, the capital of Riau Province, Sumatra, Indonesia, completed their departure procedures on April 8th and prepared to leave the area and return to their motherland via Singapore. However, the local prosecutor Nasution Harahap did everything possible to obstruct their return to China, and threatened them with a fierce attitude, and unreasonably detained their property.

Harahap repeatedly checked the luggage of these Overseas Chinese and detained many of their personal belongings, including personal clothing and old bicycles. When these Overseas Chinese reasoned with him, he picked up a five-inch sharp knife and slammed it on the table, shouting fiercely: "You are not allowed to say more, if you say more, I will beat you!"

Overseas Chinese Chen Qing asked someone to take his two children back to the motherland. The prosecutor only allowed the two children to take three sets of clothes and a blanket. The rest of the clothes and blankets were detained. He said: "The two children are only allowed to share one blanket." The children's father reasoned with the prosecutor, saying that the journey was long, the ship was prone to wind and cold, and the clothes and blankets could not be taken less. Unexpectedly, the prosecutor actually said: "Let them die!"

The eight old skirts brought by female student Pan Xingyuan were all detained by the prosecutor. When she pulled the last skirt and asked to take it away, the prosecutor threatened her with a knife in his hand, saying: "You are not allowed to take it, otherwise I will stab you!" The female student, filled with anger, patted her chest and said: "I am a daughter of China, I am not afraid of your stabbing." The luggage of these Overseas Chinese that was detained was loaded onto a truck by the authorities and had not been returned by mid-April.

    印度尼西亚有关当局在西爪哇地区
    又对华侨进行大规模迫迁活动
    并对准备回国的华侨多方阻挠和威胁
    新华社8日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚有关当局最近又在西爪哇和苏门答腊的一些地区对华侨进行大规模迫迁，并且对准备回国的华侨多方阻挠和留难。
    西爪哇有关当局最近又发布命令要万隆的芝马圩、马者拉夜、连旺三个地方的华侨迅速决定回国还是继续留居印度尼西亚。它还命令愿意留在印度尼西亚的华侨必须在6月底以前一律离开原住地，迁往指定地点。同时这项命令还规定，当地华侨所办的服务性行业虽暂允继续营业，但不准华侨在当地过夜。
    在苏门答腊北部日里雪冷县的巴敢，到4月9日为止，当地军事当局已经命令二十六户华侨小商业者交出他们的店面房屋，并威胁说，如不交出就要殴打他们。在班年的维纳那，当局曾在3月间公开宣布，凡根据“第十号总统法令”征用华侨小商业者的店面，无须征求业主的同意，违抗者一律交军警处理。
    此外，据报道，廖内省英得其利当局也策划把当地一万名华侨迫迁至冷岳、淡味拉汉和直洛关丹三地。苏门答腊南部廖内省的排华活动在当局的主使和纵容下，一向很猖狂。去年6月2日，印度尼西亚军人在哈兰岛杀死和打伤了无辜华侨各三名。8月29日，印度尼西亚军人借口搜查武器，挖掘了十几个华侨的坟墓。10月5日，廖内省当局强行征用了北干巴鲁的华侨中学和小学，七百多名华侨学生因此失学，几十名教师失业。由于禁止县以下地区华侨小商贩经营的法令的实施以及上述种种排华活动，这个省的许多华侨纷纷要求回国。但省当局竭力加以阻挠。根据当局的命令，归侨必须缴纳三年的重税后才能离境，连死了的人也必须缴清税款，否则死者的家属不得回国。在获准回国后，还需要办理各种极其复杂的手续，一般要通过十个检查站。
    据早些时候收到的消息，印度尼西亚苏门答腊廖内省省会北干巴鲁有十二位华侨在4月8日办完离境手续后，准备离开当地，经由新加坡返回祖国。但是当地的检察长纳苏蒂温·哈拉哈普百般阻挠他们回国，并且采取凶恶的态度进行威胁，并无理扣留他们的财物。
    哈拉哈普三番五次地检查这些华侨的行李，把他们的许多私人财物，包括自用的衣服和旧脚踏车在内，都通通扣留下来。当这些华侨向他讲理的时候，他还拿起一把五寸长的尖刀，向桌上猛插，并穷凶极恶地厉声喊道：“不许你们多说，再说就打你们！”
    华侨陈清托人把他的两个孩子带回祖国，检察长只准这两个孩子带三套衣服和一条毯子，其余的衣服和毯子都被扣留。他说：“两个孩子只准合用一条毯子。”孩子的父亲以路途遥远，船上易受风寒，衣服和毯子不能带少，向检察长陈情说理。不料这位检察长竟说道：“让他们死了算啦！”
    女学生潘杏元所带的八条旧裙子，全部被这位检察长扣下。当她拉着最后一条裙子要求带走的时候，检察长执刀在手，向她威胁道：“不许你带，否则我就刺你！”这位女学生怒不可遏拍着胸膛说：“我是中华儿女，不怕你刺。”这些华侨的被扣行李，都由当局装车载走，直到4月中旬未见发还。
