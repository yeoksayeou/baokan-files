    Low Yields Transformed into High Yields, Grain Deficit Transformed into Surplus Grain
    Great Development of Production in the Puqian People's Commune

    (Our Dispatch) Like people's communes across the country, the Puqian People's Commune in Wenchang County, Hainan Island, has been advancing by leaps and bounds in all aspects of construction since its establishment more than a year ago, demonstrating the immense power of the people's commune.

    The Puqian People's Commune was historically a place plagued by "droughts nine years out of ten." Of the more than 34,000 mu of farmland in the commune, only more than 4,300 mu had water for irrigation; 88% of the cultivated land suffered from "minor droughts after three days without rain, and major droughts after half a month without rain." The soil conditions here were also very poor, with most of the farmland consisting of hard-bottom, sandy soil with a very shallow cultivation layer. Therefore, it has always been a well-known disaster area and low-yield area, with an average yield of only fifty or sixty jin per mu. In the first few years after liberation, people were still powerless in the face of nature. After cooperativization, relying on collective strength, some reservoirs and ponds were built, and with other measures to increase production, production continued to develop. In 1957, the total grain output reached 7,050,000 jin, an increase of more than 30% compared with the average annual output before liberation. In September 1958, the establishment of the Puqian People's Commune united the manpower, material resources, and financial resources of dozens of advanced cooperatives and the land within a radius of nearly a hundred li. The entire commune concentrated more than 5,000 laborers and launched a vigorous water conservancy construction campaign. In just four months of hard work, the entire commune built nineteen large, medium, and small-scale water conservancy projects and dug twenty-one large canals, with a total length of more than 27,000 meters, providing irrigation for more than 70% of the farmland, basically eliminating the threat of long-standing droughts. After basically solving the water problem, last year the commune concentrated more than 4,000 people and carried out a large-scale deep plowing campaign. In one month, more than 14,000 mu of farmland were deep plowed to a depth of more than one chi. In the first year after the establishment of the commune—1959—grain harvests were unprecedented. The total grain output increased by more than 20% compared with the Great Leap Forward year of 1958. The commune members said excitedly: "One year of the commune is better than ten years."

    The Puqian People's Commune, under unified leadership, engages in fishery production. Two large fishing boats with a carrying capacity of 100 dan were newly built, and the original medium and small fishing boats were repaired and expanded to double their carrying capacity. A large number of new fishing nets, such as red fishing trawls, were also added. This has played a huge role in promoting the simultaneous development of deep-sea, mid-sea, and shallow-sea operations and the large-scale development of marine fishery production. Over the past year, industry has not only provided more than 200,000 yuan in funds for agriculture, but also produced more than 17,000 tons of chemical fertilizers and more than 400 ox carts for agricultural production. It has also produced a large number of new-style plows, harrows, threshing machines, water pumping tools, etc. According to calculations by the Commune Party Committee Office, the chemical fertilizers, new-style farm implements, and water pumping equipment provided by industry for agriculture have improved labor efficiency, saving a total of 1.3 million labor days for agriculture. As a result, fishery production has achieved a bumper harvest. In 1959, the first year after the establishment of the commune, the total output of marine fisheries reached more than 49,590 dan, an increase of more than three times compared with 1957, before the establishment of the commune.

    Wenchang County originally had no industry. After the establishment of the commune, small factories sprang up like mushrooms after a spring rain. Now, the Puqian Commune has established more than a dozen small factories, including steel plants, power plants, shipyards, farm implement repair and manufacturing plants, fertilizer plants, brick and tile plants, lime plants, rice mills, wineries, milk factories, and confectionery factories. In 1959, the total industrial output value of the entire commune reached more than 910,000 yuan. The development of commune industry has played a huge role in promoting the development of agriculture.

    Animal husbandry, forestry, sideline occupations, and cultural and educational undertakings have also been developing rapidly, as if riding on a swift steed. Comparing 1959 with the year before the establishment of the commune, in terms of animal husbandry: the number of pigs increased by 11%; the number of cattle increased by 12%; the number of sheep increased by 18%; sideline income increased by 55%; and the afforestation area increased threefold. In terms of cultural and educational undertakings: the number of primary school students increased by 14%; the number of middle school students increased by 51%, and more than 95% of school-age children were enrolled in school.

    The great achievements after communization are inspiring people's ambition to strive for greater victories. They are determined to create even greater achievements in production. The commune plans to increase the total grain output this year by two times compared with 1959, and increase fishery output by 80%; industry, animal husbandry, forestry, sideline occupations, and tropical crops will also increase several times or even ten times. The large-scale tidal power station and three power stations will also begin construction. Here, all undertakings are riding on swift steeds.

### 低产变高产　缺粮变余粮  铺前人民公社生产大发展

    低产变高产　缺粮变余粮
    铺前人民公社生产大发展
    本报讯　海南岛文昌县铺前人民公社，和全国各地人民公社一样，建社一年多来，各项建设一日千里地向前飞奔，显示了人民公社的磅礴威力。
    铺前人民公社过去是个“十年九旱”的地方，全社原有三万四千多亩农田，只有四千三百多亩有水灌溉，88％的耕地“三天无雨小旱，半月无雨大旱”。这里的土质条件也很差，全社大部分农田是耕作层很浅的硬底泥沙土壤，所以，这里历来是有名的灾区、低产区，常年平均亩产量只有五、六十斤。解放后头几年，人们在大自然面前仍然是无能为力的。合作化后，依靠集体力量，修建了一些山塘、平塘等水利设备，加上其他增产措施，生产得到不断的发展，1957年粮食总产量达七百零五万斤，比解放前的常年总产量增产30％以上。1958年9月，铺前人民公社的成立，把几十个高级社的人力、物力、财力和方圆近百华里的土地联合了起来。全社集中五千多个劳动力，掀起了热火朝天的兴修水利运动，仅经过四个月的奋战，全社就建成了大、中、小型水利工程十九宗，修挖大型渠道二十一条，长达二万七千多米，使70％以上的农田得到了灌溉，长期遗留下来的旱灾的威胁基本解除了。在基本解决了水的问题后，去年，公社又集中四千多人进行了大规模的深翻土地运动，一个月时间，就把一万四千多亩农田深翻一尺以上。公社成立后第一年——1959年粮食获得了空前的大丰收。粮食总产量比大跃进的1958年还增产20％以上。社员们兴奋地说：“公社一年胜十年”。
    铺前人民公社在统一领导下，进行渔业生产。新造了二只载重量达一百市担的大渔船，并把原来的中、小渔船修造扩大载重量一倍以上，还增添了大量红渔拖网等各种新式捕捞网具。这对深海、中海、浅海作业同时并举，大规模的发展海洋渔业生产，起了巨大的促进作用。一年多来，工业不仅为农业提供了二十多万元资金，而且为农业生产了化学肥料一万七千多吨，牛车四百多部，还为农业生产了大量的新式犁、耙、打谷机、抽水工具等。据公社党委办公室计算，从工业为农业提供的化学肥料、新式农具、抽水设备提高劳动效率来看，共为农业节省了一百三十万个劳动日。因而渔业生产获得了特大丰收。1959年，公社成立后的第一年，海洋渔业总产量达到四万九千五百九十多担，比公社化前的1957年增产三倍多。
    文昌县原来没有工业，公社成立后，小型工厂像雨后春笋一样，迅速发展起来了。现在，铺前公社已办起了钢铁厂、发电厂、造船厂、农具修造厂、化肥厂、砖瓦厂、石灰厂、碾米厂、酿酒厂、牛奶厂、糖果厂等小型工厂十多间。1959年全社工业总产值达九十一万多元。公社工业的发展对农业的发展起了巨大的促进作用。
    畜牧业、林业、副业和文化教育事业也像骑上了千里骏马一样，得到了迅速的发展。以1959年和公社化前一年比较，畜牧业方面：猪增长了11％；牛增长了12％；羊增长了18％；副业收入增长了55％；造林面积增加了三倍。文化教育事业方面：小学生增加了14％；中学生增加了51％，有95％以上的适龄儿童都入了学。
    公社化后的伟大成就，鼓舞着人们争取更大胜利的雄心，他们决心在生产上创造更大的成就。公社计划今年粮食总产量要比1959年增产二倍，渔业产量要增长80％；工业、畜牧业、林业、副业和热带作物也要成倍、成十倍地增长，规模宏大的海潮发电站和三个动力发电站也将动工兴建。在这里，所有的事业都跨上了千里马。
