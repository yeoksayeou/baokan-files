Let Every Child of the Motherland Become a "Little Scientist"
    Liu Mengkai

Children are very keen in their attention and observation of natural phenomena. They often imitate the phenomena they encounter that arouse their interest. For example, a two-and-a-half-year-old child, accompanying an adult to the market to buy vegetables, sees the funnel used for dispensing soy sauce and, upon returning home, turns over the lid of a enamel teacup (which has a small hole on top) to use as a funnel, pouring tea water into it and letting the water flow out. Some slightly older children are very interested in the scales used in the market and have adults make one out of chopsticks, which they use to weigh things. Generally, people may not pay much attention to this phenomenon, but from the perspective of natural science education, a funnel is an essential instrument in a science laboratory, and a small scale, from a physics standpoint, utilizes the principles of levers, balance, and torque to determine the weight of an object; it is truly remarkable that these physical phenomena are noticed and applied by children as young as two or three years old.

Children not only pay attention to and observe phenomena, and imitate them, but they can also raise many scientific questions, asking adults for answers. For example, a four-and-a-half-year-old child can raise the question of whether the chicken came before the egg or the egg came before the chicken, which is a major issue in the origin of life. A five-year-old child can notice the phenomenon of people leaning backward when a trolleybus or car suddenly starts, and this phenomenon is the inertia phenomenon in physics, which is only briefly mentioned in junior high school physics textbooks and is described in more detail in high school and university physics textbooks.

Since children are so keen in their attention and observation of natural phenomena, and have a certain degree of understanding, then it is natural to ask this question: if children could have the opportunity to repeatedly experiment with these natural phenomena at any time, and adults could provide correct answers and guidance, inspiring more associations and raising more questions, and answers could be provided in a timely manner, how much natural science knowledge could children acquire?

We know that there are so-called child painters, child dancers, and child musicians, and their numbers are not small. Regardless of whether these children will pursue painting, dancing, or music as their field of study in the future, they have the conditions (generally, these children's parents have artistic skills in these areas, making it easier for the children to learn) to break through the age barrier and learn early. If we can prepare the conditions for recognizing and understanding natural phenomena—scientific experimental instruments and instructors—earlier, then why can't they break through the age barrier and become "little scientists" earlier?

In the ten years since liberation, the education of preschool children has made significant progress. However, due to limitations in the level of natural science knowledge and equipment in society, the instruction provided in families, nurseries, kindergartens, and radio programs for preschool children is still limited to language, arithmetic, and general social knowledge. In fact, in terms of children's learning effectiveness, recognizing and understanding natural phenomena (which is more intuitive) is probably easier and more interesting than learning language, arithmetic, and general social knowledge (which is more abstract). Because natural phenomena can be seen, heard, and touched, and are close to life, they are very interesting (we can also prepare more toy-like experimental instruments for children to broaden their horizons and expand their contact surfaces), that is to say, they can be recognized through sensation (and with prepared and systematic guidance, a certain degree of understanding—rational understanding—can also be obtained). Since preschool children can achieve certain results in learning language, arithmetic, and general social knowledge, how can it be impossible for them to learn a certain degree of natural science knowledge? Therefore, breaking through age restrictions and preparing various instruments and experiments for recognizing and understanding natural phenomena in nurseries and kindergartens, so that every child in the motherland becomes a "little scientist," is entirely possible.

Speaking of this, we may as well further raise two questions for discussion. Why are natural phenomena that preschool children can observe and understand only taught in junior high school or higher in capitalist education? Why have physical phenomena and problems that preschool children are very interested in become the most difficult courses for students in capitalist education? (Even at present, after several teaching reforms, physics courses from junior high school to university in our country are still relatively difficult to understand, and students from worker-peasant backgrounds who have undergone rapid training find them particularly difficult.)

If you want to answer these two questions, just recall the history of educational development in our country over the past few decades. No more than fifty years ago, China was still under the rule of a feudal dynasty, and the education system followed at that time was the imperial examination system. Children who went to school only learned things like the Hundred Family Surnames, the Three Character Classic, the Thousand Character Classic, the Four Books, and the Five Classics. Even after studying for ten years, they might not be able to write a letter, let alone anything about physics or chemistry. The education at that time was exclusively for the feudal landlord class. The feudal landlord class did not engage in production and lived a life of unearned income. They did not value scientific knowledge. After the Qing Dynasty was overthrown, a set of capitalist education systems was absorbed from the West; capitalist education was naturally more advanced than feudal education, but it served the bourgeoisie. The bourgeoisie also needs science, but the bourgeoisie certainly does not need every worker to become a scientist, so the above two questions—two unreasonable educational phenomena—arose in capitalist education and have persisted to this day.

Today's China has entered a new stage of socialist construction. We want to build China into a great socialist country with highly developed modern industry, modern agriculture, modern science and culture, and modern national defense in a not too long period of time. In order to achieve this goal, we must carry out a technological revolution and a cultural revolution, and we must popularize secondary education and higher education as soon as possible, and improve the cultural and scientific knowledge level of the people as soon as possible. Under such circumstances, it should be said that the time has come to thoroughly liquidate the unreasonable things left over from the capitalist education system and further carry out the reform of the school system.

At the Second Session of the Second National People's Congress, Vice Premier Lu Dingyi made a speech on "Teaching Must Be Reformed." He proposed that, starting from now, large-scale experiments should be carried out, and within ten to twenty years, the full-time primary and secondary school system should be reformed gradually in stages and batches, so that young people aged sixteen to seventeen who have received about ten years of education will have a knowledge level roughly equivalent to that of a current university freshman. This call is undoubtedly correct and timely, and we should strive for it.

If you want to enable children aged sixteen to seventeen to master the knowledge of a current university freshman after about ten years of education, what will you do in terms of natural science? One important method is: no matter what natural science knowledge is currently taught in universities, high schools, junior high schools, or primary schools, as long as conditions can be created to teach it in nurseries and kindergartens, it must be resolutely moved to nurseries and kindergartens. Similarly, no matter what natural science knowledge is currently taught in universities, high schools, or junior high schools, as long as conditions can be created to move it to primary schools, it must be resolutely advanced to primary schools. With these two steps of advanced teaching, the content currently taught in junior high school, high school, and university textbooks can be greatly reduced. If it is further divided into two steps for teaching, then the learning task can be completed before the age of sixteen or seventeen. Now let's take an example of general biology in universities that can be advanced to kindergartens to illustrate the point.

We know that every childcare worker will tell children to wash their hands before meals and after using the toilet. If you don't wash your hands, the bacteria on your hands will enter your mouth and you will get sick. If the children ask, what do bacteria look like? Are there bacteria on my hands? Why can't I see them? For these questions, if the childcare worker is patient and there are several enlarged charts of bacteria in the nursery or kindergarten, then the childcare worker will explain it to the children according to the chart. However, under such circumstances, it is also difficult for the children to understand. If the method is changed, starting from the experiment of actual phenomena, culturing the bacteria on their hands for them to see, and magnifying them under a microscope for them to see, then the children will not only no longer have any doubts, but also gain a lot of knowledge. Through the cultivation and observation of bacteria, children can not only recognize bacteria, know that the mass reproduction of bacteria and secretion of toxins can cause food to deteriorate, and pay attention to hygiene; but they will also understand the effects of body temperature, room temperature, air temperature, sunlight, air, and ultraviolet rays on bacteria, the application of microscopes, and scientific comparative experimental methods. Undoubtedly, the harvest is really too great. This bacterial experiment was done in the general biology experiment class in the first year of university, and now it can be moved to the kindergarten, isn't it a huge educational revolution! I am afraid that it can only be done in a socialist society!

Perhaps some people will say that it is good for children's natural science education to start with repeated experiments on natural phenomena, but it is difficult to find scientific experimental instruments and people who can master scientific instruments (teachers). Regarding this issue, my view is that if we are materialists and adopt a realistic attitude, the problem can be solved. If we still have a bit of a mysterious view of natural science and do not actively think of ways, the problem will of course not be easy to solve. For example, if there are no scientific instruments, can we mobilize children's toy factories to make children's toys scientific instruments? Can we mobilize scientific instrument factories to toyize scientific instruments? If we can do this, we can quickly obtain a batch of small scientific instruments that are as cheap as children's toys and are not afraid of falling or bumping. Now toy factories generally produce dolls, horses, dogs, cars, airplanes, drums, horns, etc. If you want to use these to complete the task of teaching natural science, it is obviously not enough. If we let them make a batch of small funnels, small scales, triangular prisms, concave mirrors, convex mirrors, cylindrical mirrors, magnifying glasses, concave lenses, telescopes, pinhole images, toys for experimenting with inertia, center of gravity and levers, toys for experimenting with the mutual changes of the three states of matter, toys for experimenting with floating and sinking, toys for experimenting with triboelectricity, negative electricity, positive electricity conductors and non-conductors, etc., they will definitely be able to do it (even if toy factories may have some difficulties at the beginning, they can quickly do it after cooperating with scientific instrument factories). Without these toys, it is difficult for even the greatest scientist to make children understand science; with these toys, even a childcare worker can help children understand natural science.

There are also many interesting toys that can play a great scientific education role for children as long as they are improved according to scientific requirements. For example, children like to play with "roly-poly toys," but they don't know why. If the roly-poly toy is changed to a wooden three-section structure, one section is the head, one section is the chest, and one section is the seat, and the three sections can be disassembled and assembled at will, it can become an excellent scientific instrument. For example, putting a lead ball into the lower section will make it a "roly-poly toy," moving the lead ball into the middle section will make it a "tipping toy," and moving the lead ball into the upper section will make it a "sleeping toy," how interesting! After letting the child play with it several times, he can draw his own conclusion: "The lower the center of gravity (lead ball), the more stable the object." And this physical principle, which can only be taught in junior high school, can now be mastered by children, which is so valuable!

Secondly, talking about finding people who master scientific instruments—teachers or childcare workers—of course, we cannot let every childcare worker go to high school or university, and even if they go to high school or university, it does not necessarily solve the problem all at once. In order to do things in a more, faster, better, and more economical way, we may as well first compile a set of children's natural science textbooks and teaching methods, and then train personnel according to the textbooks and teaching methods. Again, talking about the methods of compiling teaching materials and teaching methods is also very important. If it is compiled according to the order of junior high school physics, it will definitely not succeed. My preliminary opinion is to take the mass line, the line of coming from children and going to children, that is, first teach childcare workers how to observe and record the natural phenomena that children of different ages like to see and hear, the questions they often like to ask, and the toys they often like to play with. Summarize these records in half a year to a year. Then, based on the analysis and collation of these preliminary materials, compile textbooks and teaching methods of a certain level in age order. For example, two-and-a-half-year-old children can be taught to play with funnels, how to play, and what knowledge to gain. Three-and-a-half-year-old children can be taught to play with small scales, how to play, and what lever knowledge to gain. Of course, these record materials will increase every year and change every year; the compiled teaching materials and teaching methods will also change every year with the improvement of children's natural science education and new discoveries in nature, but this direction, method, and approach should be said to be correct. Taking this approach and method to train grassroots childcare workers can also be more, faster, better, and more economical. Taking this approach and method to compile the textbooks and teaching methods to explain to the children can also meet the actual needs of children of various ages.

Let every child of the motherland become a "little scientist," what a desirable thing! I believe that with the Party, with socialism, and with the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, it is entirely possible to do it within ten or twenty years.

    让祖国的儿童个个成为“小小科学家”
    刘梦凯
    孩子们对于自然现象的注意与观察是很锐敏的。他们对自己接触到的感觉兴趣的现象，经常加以模仿。例如一个二岁半的儿童，随大人到市场上去买菜，看到打酱油的漏斗，回家来便把洋瓷茶杯的盖子（顶上有一个小孔）翻过来当漏斗玩，把茶水倒进去，让水流出来。有些年纪稍大一点的孩子则对市场上用的秤很感兴趣，让大人用筷子照做了一个，拿来秤东西。对于这种现象，一般人也许不大注意，但从自然科学教育观点来分析，漏斗是科学实验室必备的一种仪器，小秤从物理学上讲是利用杠杆、平衡与力距原理以求物重的；这些物理现象竟被二、三岁的孩子注意到，并拿来应用，实在难能可贵。
    孩子们不仅对一些现象注意与观察，加以模仿，并且还能提出许多科学上的问题，要求大人解答。例如一个四岁半的儿童，就能提出先有鸡后有蛋还是先有蛋后有鸡的问题，而这是生物起源上的一个大问题。一个五岁的孩子，就能够注意到在乘无轨电车或汽车的时候，当车身猛一开动人向车后倾倒的现象，而这种现象是物理学上的惯性现象，在初中物理教本上仅只简单的提了几句，在高中与大学物理教本中才有比较详细的介绍。
    既然孩子们对自然现象的注意与观察很锐敏，并且有一定程度的理解能力，那么很自然的就会提出这样一个问题：如果能随时让孩子们有反复实验这种种自然现象的机会，并由大人给予正确的解答和开导，使孩子们产生更多的联想，产生更多的问题，并及时给予解答，那孩子们将能获得多少的自然科学知识呢？
    我们知道有所谓儿童画家、儿童舞蹈家与儿童音乐家，并且人数还不少。不管这些孩子将来是否拿绘画、舞蹈与音乐做为他们的学习专业，他们总算有条件（一般地这些孩子的父母都有这方面的艺能，孩子们学习着比较方便）冲破了年龄的限制而早学早会了。如果我们能够早一点把认识自然现象与理解自然现象的条件——科学实验仪器和指导教师都准备好，那么为什么他们就不可以冲破年龄的限制，早一点成为“小小科学家”呢？
    解放十年来，学龄前儿童的教育有着长足的进步。但是由于社会上自然科学知识水平以及设备条件的限制，不论在家庭、托儿所、幼儿园以及对学龄前儿童的广播中所讲授的还仅限于一些语文、算术和社会常识。事实上如果就儿童学习效果来说，认识与理解自然现象（较为直观）恐怕比学习语文、算术和社会常识（较为抽象）要容易得多，而且要有兴趣得多。因为自然现象是可以看得到、听得到、摸得到的，而且与生活接近，非常有趣（我们还可以给孩子多准备些玩具式的实验仪器以扩大孩子们的眼界、耳界，扩大他们的接触面），也就是说可以借感性来认识的（再加以有准备有系统的指导也是能获得一定程度的理解——理性认识）。既然学龄前儿童学习语文、算术和社会常识尚且能够获得一定的成绩，那么让他们学习一定程度的自然科学知识怎么就不可能呢？因此，突破年龄限制，在托儿所与幼儿园中就给孩子们准备好认识与理解自然现象的各种仪器与实验，使祖国的儿童个个成为“小小科学家”是完全能够办到的。
    说到这里，我们不妨进一步提出两个问题来探讨一下。为什么学龄前儿童所能观察并理解的自然现象，在资本主义教育中却要到初中以上的课程中才讲授呢？为什么学龄前儿童非常感兴趣的物理现象与问题，在资本主义教育中却成了学生最感困难的课程呢？（即使在目前经过几度教学改革之后，在我国从初中到大学的物理课仍是比较难懂的课程，速成的工农学生尤其感到困难。）
    如果想回答这两个问题，只须回忆一下数十年来我国教育发展的历史也就够了。距今不过五十年前，中国还是在封建王朝统治之下，那时奉行的教育制度是科举制度。儿童就学，所学不过百家姓、三字经、千字文、四书、五经之类，读书十年也未必会写一封信，至于物理化学那就连个影子都没有。那时的教育是专为封建地主阶级服务的。封建地主阶级不事生产，过着不劳而获的生活，他们不重视科学知识。清朝被推翻后从西洋吸收来一套资本主义的教育制度；资本主义教育自然比封建主义的教育要进步，但它是为资产阶级服务的。资产阶级也需要科学，但资产阶级决不需要每个工人都成为科学家，因此在资本主义教育中便产生了以上两个问题——两种不合理的教育现象，并一直存在到现在。
    今天的中国已进入了社会主义建设的新阶段。我们要在不太长的时间内把中国建成为一个具有高度发展的现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化和现代国防的伟大的社会主义国家。为了达到这个目的，就要进行技术革命和文化革命，就要尽快的普及中等教育和高等教育，尽快的提高人民的文化科学知识水平。在这种情况下，彻底清算资本主义教育制度所遗留下来的不合理的东西，进一步进行学制的改革应该说是时候了。
    在全国人民代表大会二届二次会议上，陆定一副总理作了“教学必须改革”的发言。他提出从现在起，进行规模较大的试验，在十至二十年的时间内，逐步分期分批地实现全日制中小学的学制改革，让十六至十七岁的青年受过十年左右的教育，都有大约相当于目前大学一年级的知识水平。这一号召无疑说是正确的及时的，我们应该为此而奋斗。
    如果想使十六至十七岁的孩子受了十年左右的教育，就能掌握目前大学一年级的知识，在自然科学方面将怎么办呢？其中一个重要的方法就是：不论目前在大学、高中、初中或小学所讲授的自然科学知识，只要创造条件能在托儿所、幼儿园讲懂的，就坚决移到托儿所、幼儿园来讲。同样不论目前在大学、高中或初中所讲授的自然科学知识，只要创造条件能够移到小学来讲授的，就坚决提前到小学来讲授。有了这两步提前讲授，目前初中、高中和大学教本上所讲的内容就可以大大减少。如果再把它分二步讲授，那就能在十六至十七岁以前完成学习任务。现在不妨让我们举一个大学中的普通生物学可以提前到幼儿园来讲授的例子，以明究竟。
    我们知道，每个保育员都会告诉孩子，饭前便后要洗手，如不洗手，手上细菌入口是要生病的。如果孩子们要问，细菌是什么样子？手上有细菌吗？怎么我看不见？对于这些问题，如果保育员还比较耐心，托儿所或幼儿园也有几张细菌放大挂图，那末，保育员就会按照挂图给孩子们讲一讲。但是，在这种情况下，孩子们也是很难弄懂的。如果改变一下方式方法，从实际现象的实验着手，把他们手上的细菌按种培养给他们看，用显微镜放大给他们看，这样孩子们不仅不会再有丝毫怀疑，而且会获得很多知识。孩子们通过对细菌的培养与观察，不仅可以认识细菌，知道细菌大量繁殖分泌毒素能使食物变质，注意卫生；而且还会同时懂得体温、室温、气温、日光、空气、紫外线对细菌的作用，显微镜的应用以及科学的对比实验方法。无疑的，这样做收获实在太大了。这种细菌实验过去是在大学一年级普通生物学实验课上做的，现在竟能够搬到幼儿园中来做，岂不是一个天大的教育革命吗！恐怕也只有在社会主义社会才能办到吧！
    也许有人会说，儿童的自然科学教育从自然现象的反复实验着手，好是好，就是很难找到科学实验仪器和掌握科学仪器的人（教师）。关于这个问题，我的看法是这样，如果我们是唯物主义者，采取实事求是的态度，问题是能够解决的。如果我们对自然科学还带点神秘观点，又不积极去想办法，问题当然不容易解决。譬如说，没有科学仪器，我们能不能发动儿童玩具厂把儿童玩具科学仪器化呢？我们能不能发动科学仪器厂把科学仪器玩具化呢？如果能够这样做，我们就能很快获得一批像儿童玩艺儿一样的不怕摔不怕碰而又非常廉价的小小科学仪器。现在玩具厂一般生产的是小人、小马、小狗、小汽车、小飞机、小鼓、小号等，如果想拿这些去完成讲授自然科学的任务，显然是不够的。如果我们让他们做一批小漏斗、小秤、三棱镜、凹面镜、凸面镜、柱面镜、放大镜、凹透镜、望远镜、针孔的像、实验惯性、重心及杠杆的玩艺儿，实验物体三态相互变化的玩艺儿，实验浮沉的浮沉子，实验摩擦生电、阴电、阳电导电体与非导体的玩艺几等等，他们一定也能办得到（即使玩具厂在初开始也许有点困难，只要同科学仪器厂合作之后也能很快办到）。没有这些玩艺儿，多么大的科学家也难使孩子们懂得科学；有了这些玩艺儿，即使一个保育员也能帮助孩子们认识自然科学。
    也还有许多有趣的玩具，只要根据科学的要求加以改进，那就能对儿童起很大的科学教育作用。譬如小孩子都喜欢玩“不倒翁”，但苦于不知其故。如果把不倒翁改成木制的三节，一节是头部，一节是胸部，一节是座，三节可任意拆装，即可成为一个极好的科学仪器。例如，把一铅丸放入下节即成一“不倒翁”，把铅丸移入中节即成一“倒翁”，把铅丸移入上节即成一“睡翁”，多么有趣！这样让孩子玩上几次即可自己做出结论：“重心（铅丸）越靠下物体越稳定。”而这一物理原理在初中才能讲到的，现在竟能让孩子掌握了，又是多么可贵！
    其次，谈到找掌握科学仪器的人——教师或保育员的问题，我们当然不能让每个保育员都上高中或大学，即使上了高中或大学也不见得一下子即能解决问题。为了多快好省地办事，我们不妨先编制一套儿童自然科学教材与教学法，再根据教材与教学法来培训人员。再次谈到编制教材与教法的方法也很重要，如果按初高中物理的顺序去编制，那准不会成功。我的初步意见是走群众路线，走从儿童中来到儿童中去的路线，即首先教会保育员如何按照儿童年龄观察并记录儿童所喜闻乐见的自然现象，所常爱提出的问题，所常爱玩的玩艺儿等等。在半年到一年内把这些记录汇总上来。再根据这些初步材料的分析整理，按照年龄顺序编制成一定水平的教材及教法。例如，二岁半的孩子可以教给他们玩漏斗，怎样玩，获得那些知识。三岁半的孩子可以教他们玩小秤，怎样玩，获得那些杠杆知识。当然这些记录材料每年都要增加，每年都有变化；所编教材与教法也随着儿童自然科学教育的提高及自然界的新发现而每年都有新的变化，但这一方向、方式、方法应该说是正确的。拿这一方式方法去培训基层保育人员，也能多快好省。拿这一方式方法所编制的教材及教法去向孩子们讲解，也能切合各种年龄的儿童的实际需要。
    让祖国的儿童个个成为“小小科学家”，这是多么让人向往的好事！我相信有了党，有了社会主义，有了总路线、大跃进及人民公社，在十年、二十年以内是完全能够办到的。
