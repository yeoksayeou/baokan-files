Xinhua News Agency, 2nd: Speech by Krim Belkacem, Deputy Prime Minister of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, at the welcoming banquet given by Vice Premier He Long.

Marshal Zhu De, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, Vice Premier Marshal He Long, Your Excellencies, dear friends, comrades,

Please allow me, on behalf of the delegation, to express our great pleasure in being able to gather with you all tonight. Our contact with the Chinese people and the sincere reception we have received have left a deep impression on us. This will forever be etched in our hearts.

We thank the Chinese people and the government of the People's Republic of China for the invitation, which has given us the honor of having a great opportunity to come here as envoys of fighting friendship, a friendship that closely links our two countries together.

We requested that this visit be arranged during the "May Day" festival, a common celebration for workers all over the world.

We are very happy to be able to spend this meaningful festival together with the Chinese people. The great Chinese people are hardworking and brave. They are building a new world on the ruins of imperialist rule, a world of progress, peace, and benefit for all people.

For more than a hundred years, the Algerian people, victims of colonial expansion, have been fighting to restore their independence. They are fighting against their enemies, who are also the common enemies of the Chinese people and the people of Asia and Africa, and fighting to realize common ideals.

The century-long struggle of the Algerian people has entered a decisive stage for five and a half years.

The Algerian people are determined to use weapons to achieve complete liberation from colonial rule. This is a revolutionary war that is integrated with the broad movement for national independence, a movement that has enabled many countries to achieve independence.

The Chinese revolution, which thoroughly defeated imperialism, strengthened the anti-colonialist camp. The Chinese revolution is a model that has made a historic contribution to the liberation of oppressed people.

The government of the People's Republic of China is one of the advocates of the Bandung Spirit, which has enabled the oppressed people of all countries to recognize their common destiny. It has promoted the unity of the people of Asia and Africa, and the Bandung Spirit has tolled the death knell of colonialism.

For five and a half years, the Algerian people have been experiencing severe trials.

French colonialists have launched a frantic war against the just cause of the Algerian people, using all the barbaric means of colonial conquerors.

The suffering and sacrifices of the Algerian people demonstrate what monstrous crimes dying colonialists will commit. Hundreds of thousands of Algerian civilians have been massacred, many of whom were tortured to death.

Hundreds of thousands more civilians, regardless of gender, age, or youth, groan in the prisons and concentration camps of the colonialists.

Millions of old people, women, and children have been driven out of their homes and have had to wander in foreign lands.

Although the colonialists have used these barbaric means, the Algerian people have not been intimidated, and they are waging an irreconcilable and tenacious struggle.

Our National Liberation Army, which has the best sons and daughters of Algeria, is frustrating the powerful colonial army.

We believe in our people. We believe in our National Liberation Army. We are determined to fight until we achieve our independence. We believe that we will surely win the final victory.

All previous French governments have mobilized all possible forces to deal with the Algerian people, but they have been unable to stop the progress of our revolution.

Today, without the help of the North Atlantic Imperialist Alliance, or more precisely, without the help of the American ruling clique, French colonialists would not be able to continue the Algerian war.

American imperialism and French colonialism are colluding with each other to defeat the Algerian revolution. They know that Algeria is the key to Africa. In fact, the liberation of Algeria will free the entire Africa from the control of imperialism and colonialism.

The de Gaulle government, like its predecessors, seeing that it cannot defeat us by force, gives false independence to some African countries, vainly attempting to undermine the natural solidarity that exists between our people and the people of African countries.

General de Gaulle, using such neo-colonialist strategies and duplicitous tactics, has proposed suggestions on self-determination that he is not actually willing to implement, in an attempt to deceive international public opinion. He knows that his political tricks cannot deceive us. De Gaulle has never believed in the principle of self-determination, and his purpose is to maintain French rule in our country.

He continues to wage a war of extermination against the Algerian people, regardless of the consequences.

A few days ago, French troops also bombed the territories of Tunisia and Morocco.

These events show that the Algerian war may further expand and even endanger international security and peace.

In addition, our country's territory is also being used as a site for French nuclear tests.

French militarists are increasingly regarding the Algerian war as a rehearsal for an atomic war.

On the eve of the summit conference, world public opinion should see what dangers the continuing colonial war in Algeria will bring.

The easing of the international situation and the consolidation of world peace are directly related to the independence of all countries.

As long as colonialism exists, and as long as the war continues in Algeria, world peace will remain threatened.

The Algerian people's struggle for independence helps to weaken imperialism and colonialism and to frustrate the forces of war.

The Algerian people basically rely on themselves to carry out the struggle for liberation. They have the support of the Arab people, the people of Africa and Asia, and all the people of the world who love justice and freedom.

The Algerian people are particularly proud of the friendship of the great Chinese people, who, under the leadership of their wise leader, have achieved one of the greatest revolutions in history. On behalf of the Algerian people and the Algerian government, I pay tribute to this friendship, which is a guarantee of effective cooperation between the people of our two sovereign states.

Finally, I am very happy to once again express my heartfelt thanks to you for the warm and sincere welcome from the government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people.

Long live the People's Republic of China!
Long live the friendship between the Chinese people and the Algerian people!
Long live the solidarity of Asia and Africa!
Long live peace based on the independence of all countries!

    克里姆·贝勒卡塞姆副总理的讲话
    新华社2日讯　阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府副总理克里姆·贝勒卡塞姆在贺龙副总理欢迎宴会上的讲话。中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员长朱德元帅阁下，贺龙元帅副总理阁下，诸位阁下，亲爱的朋友们，同志们，
    请允许我以代表团的名义，表达我们今晚能与各位欢聚一起所感到的十分愉快的心情。我们同中国人民的接触以及我们所受到的诚挚的接待，给我们留下了深刻的印象。这将永远铭刻在我们心里。
    我们感谢中国人民和中华人民共和国政府的邀请，使我们荣幸地得到一个很好的机会，作为战斗友谊的使者来到这里，这种友谊把我们两国紧密地联系在一起。
    我们要求把这次访问安排在全世界劳动者共同欢庆的节日——“五一”节。
    我们很高兴能和中国人民在一起度过这一有意义的节日。伟大的中国人民是勤劳勇敢的。他们正在帝国主义统治的废墟上建设着新的世界，一个进步的、和平的、造福全体人民的世界。
    一百多年来，阿尔及利亚人民，殖民扩张的受害者，一直进行着恢复独立的斗争。他们在为反对自己的敌人，也是中国人民和亚非人民共同的敌人而战斗，为实现共同的理想而斗争。
    阿尔及利亚人民所进行的百年斗争，五年半以来，已进入了决定性的阶段。
    阿尔及利亚人民决心用武器来争取从殖民统治下获得彻底解放。这是一场革命战争，它同争取民族独立的广泛运动融合在一起，这个运动已使许多国家取得了独立。
    彻底战胜了帝国主义的中国革命壮大了反殖民主义阵营。中国革命是一个典范，它给被压迫人民的解放作出了历史性的贡献。
    中华人民共和国政府是万隆精神的倡导者之一，万隆精神使各国被压迫人民认清了他们的共同命运。促进了亚非人民的团结，万隆精神敲起了殖民主义的丧钟。
    五年半以来，阿尔及利亚人民经历着严重的考验。
    法国殖民主义者对阿尔及利亚人民的正义事业展开了疯狂的战争，使用了殖民征服者的各种野蛮手段。
    阿尔及利亚人民遭受的苦难和牺牲说明了在作垂死挣扎的殖民主义者会犯什么样的滔天罪行。数十万阿尔及利亚平民已遭屠杀，其中有许多人是被折磨而死的。
    还有几十万平民，不分男女老少，呻吟在殖民主义者的监狱和集中营里。
    千百万老人，妇女和儿童被赶出了家园，不得不流落他乡。
    虽然殖民主义者施用了这些野蛮手段，但是阿尔及利亚人民并没有被吓倒，他们正在进行着不调和的顽强斗争。
    我们的民族解放军拥有阿尔及利亚最优秀的儿女，他们正在挫败强大的殖民军队。
    我们相信我国的人民。我们相信我国的民族解放军。我们决心战斗，直到获得我们的独立。我们相信，我们一定能够赢得最后的胜利。
    法国历届政府曾经动员了一切可能的力量来对付阿尔及利亚人民，但是，它们无法阻止我国革命向前发展。
    今天，如果没有北大西洋帝国主义联盟的帮助，更确切地说，如果没有美国统治集团的帮助，法国殖民者是不可能继续进行阿尔及利亚战争的。
    美帝国主义和法国殖民主义者正在互相勾结，要击败阿尔及利亚的革命。他们知道，阿尔及利亚是非洲的关键。事实上，阿尔及利亚的解放将使整个非洲摆脱帝国主义和殖民主义魔爪的控制。
    戴高乐政府和他以前的政府一样，在看到无法用武力战胜我们的时候，他们就给某些非洲国家假独立，妄想破坏我国人民和非洲各国人民之间自然存在的团结。
    戴高乐将军利用这样的新殖民主义的战略和口是心非的手法，提出了实际上并不愿意付诸实施的关于自决的建议，企图欺骗国际舆论。他知道，他的政治把戏是欺骗不了我们的。戴高乐从来就不相信自决的原则，他的目的是要维持法国在我国的统治。
    他不顾一切后果地对阿尔及利亚人民继续进行着一场绝灭人种的战争。
    几天以前，法国军队还轰炸了突尼斯和摩洛哥的国土。
    这些事件表明，阿尔及利亚战争可能进一步扩大，甚至会危害国际安全与和平。
    此外，我国国土还被用作为法国进行核试验的场所。
    法国军国主义者越来越把阿尔及利亚战争看作是一场原子战争的预演。
    在首脑会议的前夕，世界舆论应当看到，在阿尔及利亚继续进行着的殖民战争会带来什么危险。
    国际局势的缓和，世界和平的巩固，和各国人民的独立有着直接的联系。
    只要殖民主义还存在，只要战争还在阿尔及利亚继续进行，世界和平就仍然受到威胁。
    阿尔及利亚人民争取独立的斗争，有助于削弱帝国主义和殖民主义，和挫败战争力量。
    阿尔及利亚人民基本上依靠自己来进行争取解放的斗争。　　他得到阿拉伯人民、非洲和亚洲人民以及全世界爱好正义和自由人民的支持。
    阿尔及利亚人民特别为伟大的中国人民的友谊而感到骄傲，中国人民在他们英明领袖的领导下，已经实现了历史上最伟大的一次革命。我代表阿尔及利亚人民和阿尔及利亚政府向这种友谊表示敬意，这种友谊是我们两个主权国家的人民进行有效合作的保证。
    最后，我很高兴地再一次向你们表示衷心的感谢，感谢中华人民共和国政府和中国人民对我们热烈的和诚挚的欢迎。
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国人民和阿尔及利亚人民之间的友谊万岁！
    亚非团结万岁！
    在各国人民独立基础上的和平万岁！（附图片）
