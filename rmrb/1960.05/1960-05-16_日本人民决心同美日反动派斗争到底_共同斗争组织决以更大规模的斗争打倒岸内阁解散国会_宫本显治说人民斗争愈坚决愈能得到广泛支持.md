Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 15th: Following a large-scale petition to the Diet, 1,200 representatives from joint struggle organizations across Japan opposing the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" held a meeting in Tokyo last night. They resolved to crush the U.S.-Japan reactionaries' plot to forcibly pass the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" in the Diet with larger-scale struggles, and demanded the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet and the dissolution of the Diet.

    The current struggle guidelines adopted by the conference stipulate that from May 17th to 26th, 5,000 or even more people will be mobilized daily to petition the Diet. On the 19th, 10,000 to 20,000 people will be mobilized to participate in the petition.

    On the 20th, the Japanese people's struggle will reach its climax nationwide. On this day, all trade unions will hold timed strikes or workplace rallies. From 4:30 PM onwards, joint struggle organizations across the country will simultaneously hold large-scale rallies and demonstrations. In Tokyo, while trade union organizations carry out their struggles, efforts will also be made to mobilize the masses to petition the Diet.

    The guidelines also stipulate that after the 22nd, the Japanese people nationwide will establish an "emergency mobilization system" to wage a more acute struggle against the U.S.-Japan reactionaries' plot to forcibly ratify the new "Security Treaty."

    An emergency declaration issued by the conference stated, "We cannot allow the Kishi Nobusuke government to continue in office, because this government is attempting to decide the fate of the country unilaterally." The declaration said that it is necessary to prevent the ratification of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke government.

    The conference also adopted a letter of protest to the Kishi Nobusuke government, demanding: (1) Do not ratify the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty"; (2) The Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet should resign en masse and dissolve the Diet; (3) The United States should withdraw U-2 spy planes from Japan.

    Public leaders from all walks of life who participated in the conference expressed their determination to carry the struggle to prevent the ratification of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" to the end.

    Asanuma Inejirō, Chairman of the Japan Socialist Party, said that the Japanese people do not trust the ruling party. Now, the conditions for dissolving the Diet are ripe.

    Miyamoto Kenji, Secretary-General of the Japanese Communist Party, emphasized after mentioning the large-scale mass rallies held by the Chinese people nationwide against the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and in support of the Japanese people's anti-U.S. patriotic struggle: "We are fighting for a just cause. Therefore, the more unyielding our struggle, the wider the support we will receive. If Japanese workers successfully launch a nationwide strike and simultaneously hold grand mass rallies, then, certainly, we will be able to defeat the Kishi Nobusuke government's plot to have the Diet ratify the Security Treaty."

    Miyamoto continued: "The Japanese people's great struggle against the revision of the Security Treaty has been waged sixteen times, and it has repeatedly disrupted the plans of the Kishi Nobusuke government and the ruling party. As a result, a situation has been created where some factionalists do not dare to openly provide assistance to Kishi Nobusuke, and Kishi Nobusuke and his accomplices cannot completely control the situation within their party."

    Yanagimoto Yoshio, head of the Political Department of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, emphasized that the Japanese people's struggle against the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" will forever be a glorious page in Japanese history.

    Representatives from various parts of Japan also spoke at the meeting, expressing their determination to step up the struggle against the Diet's ratification of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" in their respective regions.

    The representative from Kanagawa Prefecture also said that the Kanagawa Prefecture "National Conference to Prevent the Revision of the Security Treaty" is fighting against the storage of U.S. U-2 spy planes at the Atsugi base in the prefecture.

    When the letters from China were read out at the conference, including a letter from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, a storm of applause erupted in the venue.

    日本人民决心同美日反动派斗争到底
    共同斗争组织决以更大规模的斗争打倒岸内阁解散国会
    宫本显治说人民斗争愈坚决愈能得到广泛支持
    据新华社15日讯　东京消息：在向国会进行了声势浩大的请愿以后，日本全国各地反对日美“安全条约”共同斗争组织的代表一千二百人昨天晚间又在东京举行大会，决定以更大规模的斗争来粉碎美日反动派企图强使国会批准新日美“安全条约”的阴谋，要求岸信介内阁总辞职和解散国会。
    大会通过的当前斗争方针中规定，从5月17日起到26日，每天要动员五千人，甚至更多的人向国会请愿，19日将动员一万至两万人参加请愿行动。
    20日，日本人民的斗争将在全国形成最高潮。这一天，所有工会要举行定时罢工或举行工作场所大会。下午四时半起，全国各地的共同斗争组织要同时举行大规模集会和示威游行。在东京，在工会组织进行斗争的同时，还要大力动员广大群众向国会请愿。
    方针还规定，在22日以后，日本全国人民将建立“紧急动员体制”，以便同美日反动派强行批准新“安全条约”的阴谋进行更尖锐的斗争。
    大会发表的一项紧急宣言说，“我们不能容许岸信介政府继续留任，因为这个政府企图独断独行地决定国家的命运。”宣言说，必须阻止批准新日美“安全条约”并打倒岸信介政府。
    大会并且通过了对岸信介政府的抗议书，要求：（一）不批准新日美“安全条约”；（二）岸信介内阁总辞职和解散国会；（三）美国从日本撤走U—2型间谍飞机。
    参加大会的各界公众领袖都表示决心要把阻止批准新日美“安全条约”的斗争进行到底。
    日本社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎说，日本人民不信任执政党。现在，解散国会的条件已经成熟。
    日本共产党总书记宫本显治在谈到中国人民在全国范围内举行的声势浩大的反对新日美“安全条约”、支持日本人民反美爱国斗争的群众大会以后强调说：“我们是为正义的事业而斗争。因此，我们的斗争愈是不屈不挠，我们得到的支持也就愈广泛。如果日本工人成功地发动了全国性罢工，同时举行盛大的群众集会，那么，肯定地，我们就能够打败岸信介政府企图使国会批准安全条约的阴谋。”
    宫本接着说：“日本人民反对修改安全条约的伟大斗争已经进行了十六次，它一再打乱了岸信介政府和执政党的计划。因此，造成了这样的局势，一些分裂主义者也不敢公开向岸信介提供帮助，岸信介和他的帮凶也不能完全控制他们党内的局面。”
    日本工会总评议会政治部负责人柳本美雄强调说，日本人民反对新日美“安全条约”的斗争将永远是日本历史上的光辉的一页。
    日本各地代表也在会上讲话，表示决心要加紧他们各自地区的反对国会批准新日美“安全条约”的斗争。
    神奈川县的代表还说，神奈川县“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”正在为反对在县内的厚木基地存放美国U—2型间谍飞机而斗争。
    当大会宣读中国的来信，其中包括中华全国总工会的来信时，会场上响起了暴风雨般的掌声。
