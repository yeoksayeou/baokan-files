Learning from the Advanced
A Transformation of an Agricultural Production Cooperative
By Our Correspondent Huang Zhensheng

　　On a spring day, when the light yellow forsythia was just blooming and the emerald green willow branches were just sprouting, we arrived at the Třšice Agricultural Cooperative in Nové Strašecí County, Central Czechoslovakia. Comrade Kliejs, a cadre who had been transferred from the county more than a year ago, and the chairman of the cooperative warmly received us.

　　The Třšice Cooperative members' determination to catch up with the advanced is filling the cooperative with enthusiasm. For example, an old stone warehouse is being converted into a pigsty that can house two hundred pigs, and it will be equipped with automatic feeding and watering devices. The cooperative members are doing it themselves, and the construction of this pigsty will only cost more than ten thousand crowns (Czech currency), which is much more economical than building a new one. An old, low, dilapidated warehouse is now being transformed by seventy-five-year-old member Reba and a group of young people into a clean, bright farm tool repair workshop during their rest time. Although the door has not yet been installed, the electric hammer, drill press, and forge that have been installed inside are already working with a clanging sound. Not far from the repair workshop, in a shed, is a strange machine that I can't name. It turns out that this is a machine for transporting feed, manure, and digging soil, pieced together from old tractor parts and other old machine parts, and processed and modified. The cooperative members said, "We don't have much money, so we have to find ways to do more with less."

　　The cooperative is also building a hop drying room. Because hops are a major product of the cooperative, but hops need to be dried quickly after they are picked to ensure quality. The first floor of this new three-story drying room has been built, and they are striving to complete it this year. In this way, they can strive to produce more first- and second-grade hops in the future, greatly improving product quality. In addition, a modern cowshed specially for raising calves is being built on a grassy hill. This cowshed, which can accommodate fifty-five calves, is built with prefabricated wall panels, and it only took twelve hours to install the house. Near the cowshed, two large pits that can store 5,000 quintals of silage feed have been built, and another similar feed pit is under construction. The cooperative is really building everywhere!

　　However, just over a year ago, in 1958, when Comrade Kliejs responded to the Party's call to work in backward cooperatives and came to the Třšice Cooperative, the situation here was quite bad. There were few farm tools, a lack of centralized livestock feeding places, and not enough feed. A work-day (excluding payment in kind) was only worth five crowns, while at that time the average work-day in the county was eighteen crowns. The Party organization within the cooperative had not been established, and there were some problems with the labor organization. Kliejs, who was determined to come to the backward cooperative to help change the situation, faithfully implemented the Party's instructions on relying on the Party organization, relying on the masses, believing in the masses, persuading the masses, and mobilizing the masses. After being transferred here, he resolutely implemented the CPC Central Committee's instructions on improving agricultural production, and at the same time established a Party grassroots organization in the cooperative. The Party organization united all Party members, leading the cooperative politically and ideologically, and often studied the cooperative's production problems and the situation of cadres. The Party organization educated Party members to believe in the masses and to be role models among the masses. This played a great role in the cooperative's work to catch up with the advanced. It can be said that the establishment of the Party organization was a turning point for the cooperative. Under the promotion of the Party organization, the labor organization was improved, and the cooperative members were organized into hop planting teams, plant crop planting teams, etc., according to their work, and competitions were also carried out between teams. Regarding the feeding of livestock, the old habit in the past was no fixed amount, feeding at will. Now, the livestock are concentrated separately, and a fixed amount of feeding system is implemented. For beef and pork cattle and pigs, the method of feeding more refined feed is adopted. For example, a cow is fed four kilograms of refined feed a day, and as a result, it gains an average of 1.32 kilograms of meat per day. In addition, according to the Party's instructions, they planted corn on a large scale and expanded the planting area of corn and other feed crops to solve the shortage of feed. Last year, twelve hectares of corn were planted, and this year it has been increased to forty-four hectares, which basically solves the feed problem. In pig raising, they learned from the experience of other advanced cooperatives and adopted the method of laying a one-meter-deep layer in the pigsty. In this way, it is not necessary to clean up the manure every day, but to clean it up thoroughly every three or four months. By adopting this method, one person can feed 350 pigs. In 1958, the average cost of one kilogram of meat was thirteen crowns. In 1959, due to the implementation of various measures, the average daily meat gain of a pig was 0.56 kilograms, and the cost of one kilogram of meat was reduced to 5.62 crowns. Responding to the Party's call for soil improvement, the cooperative also completed the drainage project of 360 hectares of land last year.

　　After mobilizing the masses to implement the Party's instructions, the cooperative's appearance has undergone significant changes in a short period of more than a year. In 1959, the total income of the cooperative reached 2,548,406 crowns, an increase of 84% compared with 1958. The rapid growth of production is very encouraging. For example, the yield of wheat was 1.4 tons per hectare in 1958, and it increased to 2.4 tons per hectare in 1959. The yield of hops was 0.63 tons per hectare in 1958 and 0.96 tons per hectare in 1959, reaching the national level; moreover, the hops in 1958 were mostly fourth and fifth grade, while in 1959 they were on average third grade, which increased the income from hops from 320,000 crowns to 838,000 crowns. The increase in pork is particularly large, from an average of 17 kilograms of meat per hectare of farmland in 1958 to 84.7 kilograms. Therefore, the income of cooperative members has also increased significantly. A work-day, excluding in-kind income, is worth twelve crowns, more than double that of 1958. Last year, the cooperative retained 10% of the public accumulation fund and bought six new tractors, a combine harvester, and a threshing machine. This year, it is also planning to buy a tractor and a truck. In terms of production, the cooperative has put forward an ambitious plan: to complete the tasks of the third Five-Year Plan (1961-1965) within four years; and to increase production by 15% this year.

　　In 1958, there were seven such backward cooperatives in Nové Strašecí County. The county Party committee resolutely implemented the Party Central Committee's instructions to transfer outstanding cadres to strengthen rural leadership, and transferred ten cadres with strong political and professional skills to these seven cooperatives. As a result, after a year of hard work, the production of six of the seven cooperatives increased by at least 30%, and even by 168%. Based on these practices, the CPC Central Committee has taken large-scale measures to transfer cadres to the countryside. In the first quarter of this year, 13,000 cadres and technicians have been transferred to state farms, agricultural cooperatives, and township people's committees to work, and it is expected that another 7,000 people will be transferred in the second quarter.

　　Kliejs is one of the cadres in the country who has been transferred to work in cooperatives. He is the son of a bricklayer, a Party member livestock expert, and has recently been elected as a member of the executive committee of the county Party committee. He is a vigorous and modest person. He speaks briefly about himself, but eloquently about his career, and is full of beautiful ideals for the future. He has won the love of the cooperative members, who said, "The Party sent him here to work for a year, and now we are all asking him to stay for another year."

    向先进者看齐
    一个农业生产合作社的转变
    本报记者　黄振声
    在一个初春的日子里，淡黄的迎春花刚刚开放，翠绿的柳条刚刚抽芽的时候，我们来到了捷克斯洛伐克中部诺瓦斯特拉谢赤县的特什尔采农业合作社。一年多以前从县里下放来的干部克里耶斯同志和合作社主席热情地接待了我们。
    特什尔采合作社社员决心赶上先进的气概，使社里到处洋溢着热气腾腾的干劲。比如说，一座石砌的旧仓库，正被改建为一座能容二百头猪的猪舍，而且还要安装上自动添饲料和自动饮水的设备。社员们亲自动手干，修建这个猪舍只花一万多克朗（捷币），要比一个新建的节约好多倍。过去的一间矮小的破仓库，如今正由七十五岁的老社员雷巴带领一帮小伙子用休息的时间，把它修成洁白明亮的农具修理车间。虽然门还没有安起来，但里面安装好的电动锤、台钻和锻炉已在叮叮当当地工作了。离修理车间不远的棚子里，摆着一架叫不出名字的奇怪的机器。原来这是一架用旧拖拉机部件加上其他旧机器零件拼凑起来，经过加工改装的一部运饲草、畜粪和挖土的机器。社员们说：“我们钱不多，就得想办法少花钱多办事。”
    合作社还正在修建啤酒花烘干室。因为啤酒花是合作社的一项主要产品，但啤酒花采下后需要迅速烘干来保证质量。这座新的三层楼的烘干房已修建了第一层，他们要争取今年把它建成。这样，今后就可以争取多出一级、二级品的啤酒花，大大提高产品质量。此外，在一个绿草如茵的山岗上，还在建造一座现代化的专门饲养小牛的牛舍，这座能容纳五十五头小牛的牛舍，是用预制墙板建造的，只花了十二个小时就把房子安装起来。牛舍的附近已修了两个能贮存五千公担青贮饲料的大坑，另一个同样的饲料坑正在建造中。合作社真是到处都在兴建啊！
    但是，仅仅在一年多以前，在1958年克里耶斯同志响应党的到落后合作社去工作的号召，来到特什尔采合作社时，这里的情况相当不好。农具少，缺乏集中喂养牲口的场所，饲料也不够。一个劳动日（除实物支付外）只有五个多克朗，而当时全县一个劳动日平均是十八克朗。合作社内党的组织也没有建立起来，劳动组织也有些问题。决心来落后合作社帮助改变状况的克利耶斯，忠实地执行了党关于依靠党组织，依靠群众，相信群众，说服群众和动员群众的指示。他下放到这里以后，一方面坚决贯彻捷共中央关于提高农业生产的各项指示，同时在合作社建立起了党的基层组织。党组织把全体党员团结起来，从政治思想上领导合作社，经常研究合作社的生产问题和干部情况。党组织教育党员相信群众，在群众中做榜样。这对合作社赶先进的工作起了很大作用。可以说，党组织的建立是合作社的一个转折。在党组织的推动下，改进了劳动组织，按工种把社员组织成啤酒花种植队、植物作物种植队等，队与队之间还开展了竞赛。对牲畜的喂养，过去老习惯是没有定量，随便喂。现在把牲畜分别集中起来，实行了定量喂养的制度。对供肉食用的牛、猪采用了精饲料多喂的方法。例如牛一天喂四公斤精饲料，结果平均每天长肉一点三二公斤。此外，他们根据党的指示，大种玉米，扩大玉米及其他饲料的播种面积，以解决饲料的不足。去年种了十二公顷玉米，今年增加到四十四公顷，这就基本解决了饲料问题。在养猪方面，他们学习了其他先进社的经验，采用了猪栏深铺达一米的方法。这样可以不必每天清除粪便，而是三、四个月大清理一次。由于采用了这个方法，一人可喂养三百五十头猪。1958年平均一公斤肉成本是十三克朗，1959年由于采取了各项措施，一头猪平均一日长肉零点五六公斤，一公斤肉的成本降低为五点六二克朗。响应党的土壤改良的号召，合作社去年还完成了三百六十公顷土地的排水工程。
    经过动员群众贯彻党的指示的一番努力，在短短的一年多时间里，合作社面貌已有了显著的改变。1959年全社总收入达二百五十四万八千四百零六克朗，比1958年提高了84％。生产迅速增长的情况是很使人振奋的。如小麦产量，1958年一公顷为十四公担，1959年提高到二十四公担。啤酒花1958年一公顷产六点三公担，1959年是九点六公担，达到了全国水平；而且1958年的啤酒花多为四、五级品，而1959年平均是三级品，使啤酒花的收入从三十二万克朗上升为八十三万八千克朗。猪肉增加尤其多，从1958年平均一公顷田地产肉十七公斤增加到八十四点七公斤。因此社员收入也大大增加，一个劳动日除实物外收入十二克朗，比1958年提高了一倍多。去年合作社留下了10％的公积金，买了六台新拖拉机、一台联合收割机和一台打麦机。今年还计划买一台拖拉机和一辆载重汽车。在生产方面合作社提出了豪迈的计划：要在四年内完成第三个五年计划（1961—1965年）的任务；今年要把生产提高15％。
    诺瓦斯特拉谢赤县在1958年有七个这样的落后合作社。县党委会坚决贯彻了党中央抽调优秀干部加强农村领导的指示，抽了十名政治和业务都强的干部下放到这七个社。结果，经过一年的苦战，七个社中有六个社的生产都至少提高了30％甚至提高了168％。捷共中央根据这些实践采取了大规模下放干部到农村的措施。今年的第一季度一万三千名干部和技术人员已下放到国营农场、农业合作社和乡人民委员会去工作，预计在第二季度还要下放七千人。
    克里耶斯是全国被下放到合作社来工作的干部中的一个。他是个泥瓦工的儿子，是个党员畜牧专家，最近已被选为县党委执行委员会委员。他是个朝气蓬勃而又谦逊的人，谈到自己时寥寥数语，谈到事业时滔滔不绝，对未来充满着美丽的理想。他博得了社员们的爱戴，社员们说：“党派他来这里工作一年，现在我们都请求要他再多留一年。”
