　　Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, May 15th. In the vast rural areas of Shanxi Province, from the old anti-Japanese base areas in the Taihang Mountains to the Pingxingguan area in northern Shanxi, rallies and parades have been held in recent days to support the just struggle of the Japanese people against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. In Changzhi, Pingshun, Huguan, Yuncheng and other eight counties and cities alone, more than 535,000 people participated in rallies and demonstrations.

　　During the rallies and parades, the broad masses of rural people angrily condemned the towering crimes of U.S. imperialism in supporting Japanese militarism and threatening peace in Asia and the world, and resolutely supported the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle against the U.S. Xu Shunhai, a representative attending the National Militia Representative Conference and a famous militia hero in the Taihang Mountains during the Anti-Japanese War, said that he would resolutely lead the militia of the entire commune to both do a good job in production and strengthen training. If the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries dare to launch a war, they will be resolutely eliminated. National model agricultural laborers Li Shunda, Shen Jilan, Wu Houli, Guo Yu'en and others stated that they firmly support the just struggle of the Japanese people against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty and demand that U.S. imperialism get out of Japan and get out of our territory of Taiwan.
