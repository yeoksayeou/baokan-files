    Chairman Ho Chi Minh
    ——The Most Beloved Leader of the Vietnamese People
    Comrade Ho Chi Minh, President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and Chairman and General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party, was born in Kim Lien Village, Nghe An Province, central Vietnam, on May 19, 1890. This year marks his seventieth birthday.
    Chairman Ho Chi Minh, originally named Nguyen Ai Quoc, is the founder and leader of the Vietnam Workers' Party, the most beloved leader of the Vietnamese people, and an outstanding fighter in the international communist movement. From his youth, he began to fight for the liberation of Vietnam.
    From 1913 to 1916, Ho Chi Minh worked as a worker and sailor on British and French merchant ships. In 1919, when the Peace Conference was held in Versailles, Ho Chi Minh, then residing in France, sent a memorandum to the representatives attending the conference, demanding the independence of the countries of Indochina. From that time on, his name became the banner of national salvation in Vietnam.
    In December 1921, he attended the French Socialist Party Congress in the name of representatives of the working people of French colonies. When the French Communist Party was founded, Ho Chi Minh joined the Communist Party.
    During his time in France, Ho Chi Minh carried out intense activities, publishing the "Le Paria" newspaper aimed at exposing French colonial policy; establishing the "Intercolonial Union"; working among the Vietnamese residing in France; and also making contact with Vietnam, sending various books and documents back to the country, calling on everyone to unite and save the country.
    In 1923, Ho Chi Minh went from France to the Soviet Union to study and research Marxism-Leninism and absorb revolutionary experience. He also participated in the Fifth Congress of the Communist International and other meetings.
    In 1924, Ho Chi Minh went from the Soviet Union to Guangzhou, China. In Guangzhou, he established a training class for Vietnamese youth to arm them with revolutionary theory. He also established the Vietnamese Revolutionary Youth League in Guangzhou, which was the main predecessor of the later Vietnamese communist party.
    In January 1930, under the leadership of Ho Chi Minh, three Vietnamese communist organizations were unified. The Indochinese Communist Party, now the Vietnam Workers' Party, was established.
    Shortly after the party was established, Ho Chi Minh was arrested in Hong Kong. After being released from prison, he had to change his name and continue his revolutionary activities. During the Chinese War of Resistance Against Japan, he went from the Soviet Union to Yan'an, the revolutionary holy land in China, and later to the Vietnamese border. In 1941, he returned to Vietnam.
    In 1941, under the leadership of Ho Chi Minh, Vietnamese communists convened a meeting of various political parties and patriotic organizations to establish a national united front to fight for Vietnam's independence, the "Vietnam Independence League" (Viet Minh). He was elected chairman.
    During the Japanese occupation of Indochina, the Party and Ho Chi Minh led the Vietnamese people to actively prepare for armed uprisings.
    In August 1945, the news of Japan's surrender reached Vietnam. The Vietnamese people launched an armed uprising, and on August 19, liberated the capital Hanoi, destroying the evil rule of Japanese fascism and its lackeys in Vietnam. On September 2 of the same year, Chairman Ho Chi Minh delivered the Declaration of Independence in Ba Dinh Square in Hanoi in the name of the provisional government, announcing the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
    On September 23, 1945, French colonialists, with the support of American and British imperialism, re-armed and invaded southern Vietnam. Under the leadership of the Party and government headed by Chairman Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese people launched a heroic resistance war.
    In March 1946, the first session of the Vietnamese National Assembly unanimously elected Ho Chi Minh as President and Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. In December 1946, French colonialists launched a full-scale war of aggression against Vietnam. Chairman Ho Chi Minh issued a solemn appeal:
    "We would rather die than be slaves!" "We will fight to the last drop of blood! ... Victory will surely belong to our nation!" The Vietnamese people responded to this sacred call and rose up throughout the country to carry out a long-term resistance war to strike at the invaders.
    In February 1951, the Party's Second National Congress was held in Viet Bac. The Congress decided to change the name to the Vietnam Workers' Party. Ho Chi Minh was elected Chairman of the Vietnam Workers' Party.
    Under the leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and Chairman Ho Chi Minh, the heroic Vietnamese people persisted in a nine-year war of resistance, inflicting severe blows on the French aggressors and shattering the US's interference and its attempt to expand the Vietnam War. In July 1954, the Geneva Conference reached an agreement on the restoration of peace in Indochina. This was a great victory for the Vietnamese people and a major victory for the world's peace forces.
    After the restoration of peace, under the leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party and Chairman Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese people began to restore the national economy and complete land reform. At the same time, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, headed by Chairman Ho Chi Minh, thoroughly implemented the policy of consolidating peace and implementing the Geneva Accords, and struggled to realize the reunification of Vietnam.
    In recent years, under the leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party and Chairman Ho Chi Minh, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has achieved great successes in socialist transformation and socialist economic and cultural construction.
    In the summer of 1955, Chairman Ho Chi Minh led a delegation from the Party and government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to visit China. In the autumn of 1959, Chairman Ho Chi Minh once again led a delegation from the Vietnamese Party and government to China to participate in the celebrations of the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
    Chairman Ho Chi Minh dedicated all his energy to the revolutionary cause. He is the most beloved leader of the Vietnamese people and also the closest friend of the Chinese people. On the occasion of his seventieth birthday, the Chinese people express their highest respect to him.

    胡志明主席
    ——越南人民最爱戴的领袖
    越南民主共和国主席、越南劳动党中央委员会主席兼总书记胡志明同志于1890年5月19日生于越南中部义安省的金莲乡。今年是他的七十大庆。
    胡志明主席原名阮爱国，是越南劳动党的创始者和领导者、越南人民最敬爱的领袖、国际共产主义运动杰出的战士。他从青年时代起，就开始为越南的解放事业而奋斗。
    在1913至1916年间，胡志明曾在英、法的商船上当过工人和水手。1919年，和平会议在凡尔赛召开，当时旅居法国的胡志明曾给出席和会的代表们一份备忘录，要求让印度支那各国独立。从那时起，他的名字在越南成为救国的旗帜。
    1921年12月，他以法属各国劳动人民代表的名义出席法国社会党代表大会。在法国共产党成立时，胡志明参加了共产党。
    胡志明在法国期间，展开了紧张的活动，出版了旨在揭露法国殖民政策的“穷苦人报”；成立“殖民地各民族联合会”；在旅居法国的越南人中进行工作；同时还同越南国内取得联系，把各种书刊文件送回国内，号召大家团结救国。
    1923年，胡志明由法国到苏联，进行马克思列宁主义的学习和研究，吸取革命经验。他还参加了第五次国际共产主义者代表大会和其他一些会议。
    1924年，胡志明从苏联到了中国的广州。他在广州举办一个越南青年的训练班，以革命理论来武装越南青年。他在广州还成立了越南革命青年同志会，这个组织是后来越南共产主义政党的主要前身。
    1930年1月，在胡志明的领导下，三个越南共产主义组织统一起来。印度支那共产党即现在的越南劳动党成立了。
    党成立后不久，胡志明在香港被捕，出狱后，他不得不改名换姓，继续进行革命活动。在中国抗日战争期间，他由苏联到中国革命圣地延安，后来又到越南边境。1941年他回到越南。
    1941年，在胡志明的领导下，越南共产党人召集各政党和爱国团体举行会议，成立一个为越南的独立而斗争的民族统一战线“越南独立同盟”（简称越盟）。他被选为主席。
    在日本占领印度支那期间，党和胡志明领导越南人民积极准备武装起义。
    1945年8月，日本投降的消息传到越南。越南人民发动武装起义，8月19日解放了首都河内，摧毁了日本法西斯和它的走狗在越南的罪恶统治。同年9月2日胡志明主席在河内巴亭广场以临时政府名义发表独立宣言。宣布越南民主共和国成立。
    1945年9月23日，法国殖民主义者在美、英帝国主义的支持下重新武装侵略越南南部，越南人民在以胡志明主席为首的党和政府的领导下，展开了英勇的抗战。
    1946年3月，越南国会第一次会议一致推选胡志明为越南民主共和国主席兼总理。1946年12月，法国殖民主义者全面发动了侵越战争。胡志明主席发出了庄严的号召：
  “宁死不愿作奴隶！”“我们要战斗到最后一滴血！……胜利一定属于我们民族！”越南人民响应这个神圣的召唤，在全国范围奋起进行打击侵略者的长期抗战。
    1951年2月，党的第二次代表大会在越北召开。大会决定改名为越南劳动党。胡志明被选为越南劳动党主席。
    在越南劳动党、越南民主共和国政府和胡志明主席的领导下，英雄的越南人民坚持了九年抗战，给予法国侵略者以严重的打击，粉碎了美国的干涉和企图扩大越南战争的阴谋。1954年7月，日内瓦会议就恢复印度支那和平问题达成了协议。这是越南人民的巨大胜利，也是世界和平力量的重大胜利。
    和平恢复以后，在越南劳动党和胡志明主席领导下，越南人民着手进行恢复国民经济和完成土地改革的工作。同时以胡志明主席为首的越南民主共和国政府，彻底执行巩固和平、实行日内瓦协议的政策，为实现越南的统一而斗争。
    最近几年，在越南劳动党和胡志明主席的领导下，越南民主共和国在社会主义改造和社会主义的经济建设和文化建设等方面获得巨大的成就。
    1955年夏天，胡志明主席率领了越南民主共和国党政代表团访问了中国。1959年秋天，胡志明主席又一次率领越南党政代表团到中国，参加了中华人民共和国建国十周年的庆典。
    胡志明主席把他全部精力贡献给革命事业。他是越南人民最爱戴的领袖，也是中国人民最亲密的朋友。在他的七十大庆的时候，中国人民向他表示崇高的敬意。
