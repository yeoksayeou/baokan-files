Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 27th: After the basic completion of rapeseed harvesting in various people's communes in Sichuan Province, a campaign is underway to rush the sale and storage of rapeseed. As of May 23, the rapeseed sold and stored by people's communes throughout the province reached 36.7% of the state's unified purchase task, an increase of 70% compared with the same period last year. Thirteen counties and cities, including Nanchong, Wusheng, Nanbu, Yilong, and Liangping, have already overfulfilled the unified purchase task for rapeseed.

Sichuan is one of the main rapeseed producing areas in China. This year, various localities have implemented the method of unified management and unified sales by the management area, ensuring that harvesting, threshing, drying, and selling are closely linked, and the progress of rapeseed storage is very rapid. In the acquisition process, various localities have conscientiously implemented the principle of pricing according to quality. Many areas have also set up medical stations and tea stations to facilitate the delivery and sale of rapeseed by the masses.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 27th: People's communes in various parts of Jiangxi Province are rapidly selling oil after the bumper harvest of rapeseed, which has greatly accelerated the progress of spring oil procurement throughout the province. Currently, eight counties and cities, including Nanfeng and Nancheng, have completed and exceeded their procurement tasks ahead of schedule.

This year, the rapeseed harvesting season in Jiangxi Province coincided with cloudy and rainy weather. People's communes in various localities generally rushed to harvest during cloudy days and turned over to dry during sunny days. They adopted methods such as harvesting, transporting, threshing, drying, roasting, and baking to ensure that the rapeseed was harvested quickly and the quality of the stored rapeseed was good, generally reaching dryness, fullness, and cleanliness, meeting the standards stipulated by the state.

The Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China made a decision in early March, requiring party committees at all levels to conscientiously implement the procurement policy, make comprehensive arrangements for production, procurement, distribution, and livelihood, and implement unified threshing, unified storage, unified sales, and unified distribution by production team to complete the procurement task in a faster, better, and more economical way. According to the decision of the Provincial Party Committee, party committees and relevant departments at all levels transferred a large number of cadres to strengthen leadership over this work and make preparations for various procurement tasks.

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 27th: People's communes in various parts of Guizhou Province are using the experience of rapid autumn grain storage last year to vigorously promote the "one-stop" process of harvesting, threshing, drying, transporting, and storing, to sell grain and oil to the state. As of May 14, the amount of wheat and rapeseed purchased had reached 25% and 31% of the state's assigned targets, respectively.

The sown area of wheat, rapeseed, and miscellaneous grains in Guizhou Province this year has been expanded compared with last year, and the planting is concentrated in pieces, and the maturity time is consistent. According to this characteristic, people's communes in various localities closely focus on the current production and organize various professional teams to form a "one-stop" process of harvesting, threshing, drying, transporting, and storing, linking each link closely, in one go. In order to adapt to the needs of the "one-stop" process, various localities have also innovated tools according to local conditions, such as popularizing the use of threshing machines, replacing wooden sticks with stone rollers for threshing, and using wooden rail flat cars for transportation, all of which have doubled the efficiency.

Various localities have given full play to the superiority of the people's communes, organizing cooperation and support between high mountain areas and plain dam areas, early-maturing areas and late-maturing areas, areas far from warehouses and areas near warehouses, greatly accelerating the progress of grain and oil storage. For example, Huishui County drew 30% to 50% of the labor force from the late-maturing areas to help the large-area mature areas rush to harvest and transport, and completed the wheat procurement task in only ten days.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 27th: After the general bumper harvest of wheat and barley in the Wen Zhou Special District, Zhejiang Province, people's communes have sold good grain to the state. As of May 17, the amount of wheat and barley purchased and stored in the entire special district was more than double that of the same period last year.

After the basic completion of summer harvesting and summer planting in various people's communes in the Wen Zhou Special District, they uniformly arranged labor and mobilized the masses to transport grain to the warehouse. Inspired by the bumper harvest, the broad masses of commune members competed to dry and winnow the wheat and select good grain to sell to the state. Huangtian Commune in Yongjia County organized commune members to harvest, thresh, dry, and sell to the warehouse at the same time, and overfulfilled the state's unified purchase task in two days.

In the procurement work, all counties have paid attention to taking into account the interests of the state, the collective, and the commune members, and have reserved enough food rations, seeds, and feed according to standards, which the commune members are very satisfied with. (Attached picture)

    喜庆夏粮丰收　踊跃交售粮油
    四川各地开展突击交售菜籽运动　江西八个县市完成油料征购任务
    贵州大搞收、打、晒、运、入库“一条龙”　温州专区各公社选好粮卖给国家
    据新华社成都27日电　四川省各人民公社在油菜基本收割完毕以后，正开展一个突击交售菜籽入库的运动。到5月23日止，全省各人民公社交售入库的油菜籽，达到了国家统购任务的36.7％，比去年同期增加70％；南充、武胜、南部、仪陇、梁平等十三个县、市，已经超额完成了油菜籽的统购任务。
    四川是我国油菜主要产区之一。今年，各地实行了以管理区为单位，统一掌握、统一交售的办法，做到收、打、晒、售环环扣紧，油菜籽入库进度很快。各地在收购中，都认真贯彻了依质论价的原则。许多地区还设了医药站，茶水站等，便利群众送售。
    据新华社南昌27日电　江西各地人民公社在油菜丰收以后迅速出售油料，使全省春季油料的征购进度比去年大大加快，目前已有南丰、南城等八个县、市提前和超额完成了征购任务。
    今年江西省油菜收割季节正值阴雨，各地人民公社普遍抢阴收割、抢晴翻晒、采取随收、随运、随打、随即晾、晒、烤、烘等办法，使油菜籽收获得快，入库菜籽的质量也好，普遍达到干、满、净，符合国家规定的标准。
    中共江西省委在3月初曾经作出决定，要求各地党委认真贯彻征购政策，要对生产、征购、分配、生活全面作出安排，以生产大队为单位，实行统一打晒、统一保管、统一交售、统一分配，多快好省地完成收购任务。根据省委决定，各级党委和有关部门抽调了大批干部，加强对这一工作的领导，作好各项征购准备工作。
    据新华社贵阳27日电　贵州省各地人民公社，运用去年秋粮快速入库的经验，大搞收、打、晒、运、入库“一条龙”，向国家交售粮油。到5月14日，小麦和油菜籽的征购数量，已经分别达到国家下达指标的25％和31％。
    贵州省今年的小麦、油菜、杂粮播种面积都比去年扩大，而且种植成片集中，成熟时间一致。根据这个特点，各地人民公社紧密围绕当前生产，组织各种专业队，使收、打、晒、运、入库形成“一条龙”，环环扣紧，一鼓作气，一气呵成。为适应“一条龙”的需要，各地还因地制宜地革新工具，如推广使用脱粒机，以石磙代替木棍打场，用木轨平车运输等，都使工效成倍地提高。
    各地充分发挥人民公社的优越性，组织高山区与平坝区、早熟区与晚熟区、离仓远的地区和离仓近的地区，相互协作支援，大大加快了粮油入库进度。如惠水县在晚熟区抽调了30％到50％的劳动力，帮助大面积成熟的地区抢收抢运，只十天时间就完成了小麦征购任务。
    据新华社杭州27日电　浙江省温州专区各人民公社在大、小麦普告大丰收后，纷纷把好粮卖给国家。到5月17日止，全专区已经征购入库的大小麦，比去年同期多一倍多。
    温州专区各地人民公社在夏收夏种基本结束以后，就统一安排劳力，发动群众运送粮食入库。广大社员在大丰收的鼓舞下，争先把麦子晒干扬净，选好粮卖给国家。永嘉县黄田公社组织社员边收、边打、边晒、边交售入库，在两天内就超额完成了国家统购任务。
    在征购工作中，各县都注意兼顾国家、集体、社员三方面的利益，按标准留足口粮、种子和饲料，社员群众非常满意。（附图片）
