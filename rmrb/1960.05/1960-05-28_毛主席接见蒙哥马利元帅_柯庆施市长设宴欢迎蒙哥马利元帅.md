Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 27th: Chairman Mao Zedong met with British Field Marshal Montgomery, who is currently visiting China, in Shanghai today and had dinner with him. Ke Qingshi, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Mayor of Shanghai, was present at the meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 27th: Shanghai Mayor Ke Qingshi hosted a banquet at noon today to welcome British Field Marshal Montgomery, who arrived in Shanghai for a visit this morning.

Mayor Ke Qingshi spoke first at the banquet. On behalf of the people of Shanghai, he welcomed Field Marshal Montgomery, who came for a friendly visit and is willing to make efforts to ease international tensions and for world peace. He said: It is a good thing that Field Marshal Montgomery came to China to see what our people are doing and thinking. The people of Shanghai, like the people of the whole country, are tirelessly struggling for a prosperous and beautiful life. However, U.S. imperialism still occupies our territory of Taiwan, actively reviving Japanese militarism, and has established many military bases around our country. At the same time, U.S. warships and aircraft constantly violate our territorial waters and airspace. Our peace-loving people will never be intimidated by such acts of aggression and war provocations. Every debt owed to us by U.S. imperialism must be repaid. Mayor Ke Qingshi concluded by saying that Field Marshal Montgomery's visit to China will surely make a good contribution to promoting friendship between the two peoples.

In his speech, Field Marshal Montgomery thanked Mayor Ke Qingshi for his welcome. He said that in Asia, a major issue is the Taiwan issue. As a rational soldier, I have always believed that there is only one China in the world, the Chinese government is in Beijing, and Taiwan is part of Chinese territory. This view is rational.

Montgomery said that he had been to Shanghai about thirty years ago. When he came to Shanghai again today, he personally saw that Shanghai today is very different from Shanghai at that time. Shanghai has undergone great changes. He wished Shanghai all success in its future construction and development. He also proposed a toast to the Mayor's health and the prosperity of Shanghai.

When Field Marshal Montgomery arrived in Shanghai by plane from Beijing this morning, he was welcomed at the airport by Cao Diqiu, Vice Mayor of Shanghai, and Xiong Yingtang, Deputy Commander of the Shanghai Garrison of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and Director of the Shanghai National Defense Sports Association. Lai Weide, Counselor of the British Chargé d'Affaires Office in China stationed in Shanghai, also came to the airport to welcome him.

In the afternoon, Field Marshal Montgomery visited the Maqiao People's Commune in the suburbs of Shanghai.

Xinhua News Agency, May 27th: British Field Marshal Montgomery left Beijing by plane this morning to visit Shanghai.

Accompanying him were General Li Da, Director of the China National Defense Sports Association, Rong Gaotang, Vice Chairman of the Sports Commission, Yu Peiwen, Director of the Protocol Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Song Zhiguang, Deputy Director of the Department of Western European Affairs.

Wang Shusheng, Vice Minister of National Defense, General Yang Yong, Commander of the Beijing-Tianjin Garrison of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Lin Haiyun, Vice Minister of Foreign Trade, Huang Zhong, Vice Chairman of the Sports Commission, and Wu Han, Vice Mayor of Beijing, saw him off at the airport.

    柯庆施市长设宴欢迎蒙哥马利元帅
    新华社上海27日电　毛泽东主席今天在上海接见了正在中国访问的英国蒙哥马利元帅并共进晚餐。陪同接见的有中共中央政治局委员、上海市市长柯庆施。
    新华社上海27日电　上海市市长柯庆施今天中午设宴欢迎上午到达上海访问的英国蒙哥马利元帅。
    柯庆施市长在宴会上首先讲话。他代表上海人民对前来作友好访问的、又愿意为缓和国际紧张局势、为世界和平作出努力的蒙哥马利元帅表示欢迎。他说：蒙哥马利元帅来中国访问，看看我们的人民在作什么，在想什么，这是很好的事情。上海人民和全国人民一样，都在为繁荣美好的生活进行着不倦的斗争。但是美帝国主义还霸占着我国的领土台湾，积极复活日本军国主义，在我国的周围建立了很多军事基地，同时美国军舰和飞机不断侵犯我国的领海领空。我们热爱和平的人民绝不会被这种侵略行为和战争挑衅所吓倒，美帝国主义欠我们的每一笔债都是必须要偿还的。柯庆施市长最后说，蒙哥马利元帅在中国的访问，对促进两国人民的友好一定会作出很好的贡献。
    蒙哥马利元帅在讲话中感谢柯庆施市长对他的欢迎，他说，在亚洲来讲，一个大问题就是台湾问题。作为一个有理智的军人，我一贯认为世界上只有一个中国，中国政府在北京，台湾是中国领土的一部分。这种看法是理智的。
    蒙哥马利说，大约三十年前他来过上海，今天又来到上海的时候，亲眼看到现在的上海和那个时候的上海有很大的不同。上海已经发生了很大的变化。他祝上海在今后的建设和发展中一切都获得成功。他还提议为市长的健康和上海的繁荣干杯。
    蒙哥马利元帅今天上午从北京乘飞机来到上海的时候，在机场上受到了上海市副市长曹荻秋，上海市国防体育协会主任、中国人民解放军上海警备区副司令员熊应堂少将等人的欢迎。到机场欢迎的还有英国驻中国代办处驻上海参赞赖伟德。
