　　 Oppressive Rule and Exploitation, Food Shortages and Starvation
　　 South Korean Peasants Struggle on the Brink of Death

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 13th: Seoul dispatch: Under the cruel oppression and exploitation of the US-Li group, the vast rural areas of South Korea have fallen into a deep abyss of severe economic bankruptcy, and hundreds of thousands of peasants are struggling on the brink of death.

According to a dispatch from Daegu by the South Korean World News Agency, the peasants of Ulleung Island on the east coast of South Korea are on the verge of starvation. More than 17,000 people now live on this isolated island, more than 260 kilometers from the mainland. Their crops have died, and their fishing boats and fishing gear were swept away by two typhoons last fall. As a result, they spent last winter eating grass roots and tree bark.

Due to the oppressive rule of the American imperialists and the traitorous Li Seung-man, the annual spring famine that plagues the South Korean countryside has arrived again this year as usual. In South Jeolla Province alone, more than 800,000 peasants ran out of food in January of this year.

However, the "caretaker cabinet" of the new American puppet Heo Jeong group, which replaced Li Seung-man, not only shows indifference to the plight of the vast rural areas of South Korea, but also engages in cruel and oppressive rule and exploitation, just like Li Seung-man.

    苛政压榨　断粮挨饿 
    南朝鲜千万农民挣扎在死亡线上
    据新华社平壤13日电　汉城消息：在美李集团残酷的压榨、盘剥下的南朝鲜广大农村，已陷于严重的经济破产的深渊，成千上万的农民挣扎在死亡线上。
    据南朝鲜世界通讯社自大丘发出的消息说，南朝鲜东海岸郁陵岛的农民们快要饿死了。现在有一万七千多人生活在这个离陆地二百六十多公里的孤岛上。他们的庄稼已经死掉，他们的渔船和捕鱼用具都在去年秋天被两次台风刮走。因而他们靠草根和树皮度过了去年冬天。
    由于美帝国主义和李承晚卖国贼的苛政，每年都使南朝鲜乡村遭殃的春荒今年照例又来了。单单在全罗南道，今年1月份就有八十多万农民断粮。
    但是，代替李承晚的美国新傀儡许政集团的“看守内阁”，对南朝鲜广大农村这种情况不仅漠不关心，并且和李承晚一样在虐行苛政和压榨。
