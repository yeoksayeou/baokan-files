Xinhua News Agency, 3rd May. The China-Iraq Friendship Association held a reception at the Beijing Hotel this evening to warmly welcome the Iraqi cultural delegation and the Iraqi trade union delegation who are visiting our country.

The reception was filled with a warm and friendly atmosphere. Guests and hosts frequently raised their glasses to toast the friendship between the peoples of China and Iraq. The Iraqi friends also enthusiastically shouted in Chinese: "Long live the consolidated friendship between the Chinese and Iraqi people!"

The entire Iraqi cultural delegation, led by Dr. Mahdi Mattsumi, and the entire Iraqi trade union delegation, led by Ali Shukr, attended today's reception.

Also present at the reception were the Iraqi Ambassador to China, Abdul Haq Fazil, and Iraqi students.

Liu Ningyi, President of the China-Iraq Friendship Association, spoke at the meeting. He first extended a warm welcome to the Iraqi friends who had come from afar. He said that although China and Iraq are thousands of miles apart, the common experiences and common struggle against imperialism have united the two peoples more closely. In the past two years, friendly exchanges between the two peoples have developed rapidly. Today, we can gather here with so many Iraqi friends like a family, which is the most eloquent proof.

Liu Ningyi said that the Chinese people have always held a deep sympathy and firm support for the heroic and just struggle of the Iraqi people. In the future, the Chinese people will stand firmly with the Iraqi people in the struggle against imperialist aggression and subversion plots, to safeguard national independence, and to defend world peace.

Mahdi Mattsumi, head of the Iraqi cultural delegation, said at the meeting that the Iraqi and Chinese peoples have a long history of friendship, and this friendship has been further strengthened after the liberation of the two countries. He said that the Iraqi people deeply thank the great Chinese people for their strong support for the Iraqi revolution.

Also present at the reception were Luo Jun, Vice President of the China-Iraq Friendship Association, Ding Xilin, Deputy Director of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, Liu Aifeng, Deputy Minister of Education, directors of the China-Iraq Friendship Association, and people from cultural, educational, and trade union circles in the capital, as well as people who have visited Iraq.
