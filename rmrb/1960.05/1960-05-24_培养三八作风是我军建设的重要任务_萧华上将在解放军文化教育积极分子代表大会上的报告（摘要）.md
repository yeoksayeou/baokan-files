Xinhua News Agency, 22nd: Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, General Xiao Hua, delivered a report at the All-Army Conference of Activists in Cultural and Educational Work, entitled "Cultivating the Three-Eight Style is an Important Task of Our Army Building." Here is a summary:

A vigorous campaign to cultivate the Three-Eight Style is underway throughout the army. This is a major event for our army at present and an important task in the modernization of our army. This conference should not only be a mobilization meeting to promote the continued great leap forward in our army's cultural and educational work, but also a mobilization meeting for carrying out the movement to cultivate the Three-Eight Style throughout the army. All the delegates should not only be the backbone of our army's cultural and educational work, but also active members in cultivating and promoting the Three-Eight Style. (I)

Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, our army has developed a fine traditional style in the long and arduous revolutionary struggle. Chairman Mao summarized this style into three sentences and eight characters. The three sentences are: a firm and correct political direction, a hard-working and simple work style, and flexible and mobile strategies and tactics; the eight characters are: unity, tension, seriousness, and liveliness. This fine style is an important component of Mao Zedong's military thought, a concentrated manifestation of the essence of the people's army, and an important factor in our army's ability to overcome powerful enemies at home and abroad and complete various tasks under extremely difficult conditions.

The three sentences and eight characters, although simple and unadorned, contain extremely rich and profound ideas. It clearly and completely summarizes the main content of our army's fine traditional style.

Every officer and soldier of our army must have a firm and correct political direction. Our army is an armed group absolutely led by the Chinese Communist Party to serve the Chinese people's revolution. The highest ideal of our army is to realize communism in China and the world. The Party and Chairman Mao correctly lead us towards this great and lofty goal. Therefore, every revolutionary soldier should have the ambition to fight to the end for the cause of communism; all should listen to the Party and Chairman Mao, advance bravely towards the direction indicated by the Party and Chairman Mao, and follow the Party's general line, step by step towards the ultimate goal. Chairman Mao often warned us that we must not forget our general goal and general line at any time. In order to realize our lofty ideals more quickly and better, and to adhere to the correct political direction consistently, all officers and soldiers must strive to study Marxism-Leninism, study Mao Zedong's works, establish a proletarian world view, and eliminate the influence of the bourgeois world view; must firmly stand on the proletarian stand; must establish the idea of continuous revolution; must have a high degree of hatred for the enemies of the revolution, and be heroic and unyielding in the struggle against the enemy; must wholeheartedly serve the people and contribute all their strength to the revolutionary cause; must resolutely implement the Party's political line, military line and various policies, and wage an irreconcilable struggle against all tendencies that violate the Party's line and policies. At the present stage, it is particularly important to hold high the three red banners of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and strive to thoroughly complete the socialist revolution, accelerate socialist construction, and gradually transition to communism! To fight against imperialism, against modern revisionism, to defend Marxism-Leninism, and to defend world peace!

All officers and soldiers of the army must also have a hard-working and simple work style. Hard work and simplicity are the true colors of our proletariat. In the years of war, it was precisely because we carried forward the fine tradition of hard work and simplicity that we overcame many unimaginable difficulties and moved from victory to victory; in the future, we must continue to carry forward this style, forge ahead courageously, overcome all difficulties on the road ahead, and strive for greater victories. To this end, all comrades in the army must have a realistic and scientific attitude in their work, conduct in-depth investigation and research, painstakingly study problems, proceed from reality, act in accordance with objective laws, and combine soaring drive with the spirit of scientific analysis. The hard-working and simple work style also requires us to practice strict economy, build the country industriously and thriftily, build the army industriously and thriftily, run all undertakings industriously and thriftily, and also to manage our households industriously and thriftily, live plainly, and share weal and woe with the people.

In the long revolutionary war, under the guidance of Mao Zedong's military thought, our army has formed a set of flexible and mobile strategies and tactics necessary for people's war. This is our army's treasure for defeating the enemy. Chairman Mao often emphasized that we must be good at applying the principles of strategy and tactics according to the changing specific conditions, fighting different battles against different enemies, fighting with whatever weapons we have, fighting under whatever conditions, using our strengths to attack the enemy's weaknesses, and giving full play to subjective initiative in war. To this end, we must establish the idea of actively annihilating the enemy; we must make specific analysis of objective situations; we must actively study Chairman Mao's strategic and tactical thinking, sum up our army's experience, and implement the strategic policies of the Central Military Commission.

Unity requires that all officers and soldiers, superiors and subordinates, departments, friendly neighbors, and the military and government should be politically consistent, ideologically consistent, and consistent in action. It requires mutual respect and mutual assistance, and close ties between our army and the people, local government agencies, and organizations. It is also necessary to strengthen the internationalist unity with the people and armies of fraternal countries. Unity is strength. Unity is the life of the Party and a basic principle of Marxism-Leninism. Unity must be, and can only be, unity around the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and must be, and can only be, based on Marxism-Leninism. Only when everyone resolutely implements the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's lines, policies, guidelines, and instructions can we work together with one heart and one mind. To achieve good unity, it is also necessary to promote the communist style of "taking on difficulties when they arise, giving way to honors when they arise, learning from the advanced when they arise, and helping the backward when they arise," and to promote the communist spirit of cooperation of "one person in trouble, ten thousand people helping, one place in difficulty, support from all directions." To achieve good unity, it is also necessary to establish a global perspective and take the overall situation into account. To achieve good unity, we must also have a humble attitude. To achieve good unity, it is also necessary to adhere to our army's democratic system, improve democratic life, and carry forward our army's glorious tradition of officers and soldiers eating, living, working, operating, and entertaining together.

Tension requires us to have soaring enthusiasm, act swiftly, be high-spirited, energetic, strive for the upstream, and strive for high speed. Working tensely and leaping forward at high speed have become our normal way of life. Time is a kind of power, and this is true in peacetime work and even more so in wartime. "Speed is of the essence in war." Therefore, we must particularly emphasize the concept of time and emphasize rapid action; we must develop the style of striving for the upstream and striving for high speed. Tension also requires attention to working methods, improving work efficiency, strengthening work planning, carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution movements, giving full play to the wisdom of the masses, and combining hard work with skillful work. There must also be a combination of work and rest, both shock work and necessary rest, so that various tasks can continue to leap forward rhythmically. We must also pay attention to the quality of work and never be shoddy. In short, things must be done more, faster, better, and more economically.

Seriousness requires every comrade to have a high degree of principle. Whether or not one has principle is an important standard for testing whether a Communist Party member and revolutionary fighter are politically firm and loyal to the Party. Officers and soldiers of our army should not only be resolute and brave on the front line to annihilate the enemy; but also should be resolute and brave in the political and ideological front to struggle against all erroneous ideological tendencies. Seriousness not only requires resolutely struggling against the erroneous ideas of others, but more importantly, every comrade must have a high degree of self-criticism and strict requirements for themselves. Seriousness also requires us to be conscientious and responsible, honest and diligent, hardworking and dedicated, and willing to bear hardships without complaint in our work. Seriousness also requires the troops to have strict discipline. In this way, our army can become the most principled and disciplined army with a high degree of political and ideological unity.

Liveliness requires the officers and soldiers of our army to be vigorous, energetic, and in high spirits. Liveliness also requires the officers and soldiers of our army to highly develop revolutionary creativity, always maintain vigorous political enthusiasm and enterprising spirit, and have unlimited confidence in the revolutionary cause and be full of optimism. This is a necessary condition for giving full play to all positive factors, improving work efficiency, and completing various tasks.

The Three-Eight Style is a concentrated expression of the essence of the people's army. Chairman Mao pointed out long ago that our army is an armed group that carries out revolutionary political tasks. "Standing closely with the Chinese people and serving the Chinese people wholeheartedly" is the only purpose of our army. This determines that our army must have a firm and correct political direction, a hard-working and simple work style, flexible and mobile strategies and tactics, as well as a style of unity, tension, seriousness, and liveliness. This style is the style of Marxism. The formation of this style is the result of Chairman Mao's thought on people's army and people's war being grasped by the broad masses of officers and soldiers of our army and cultivated through the practice of long-term revolutionary struggle. It is an important component of Mao Zedong's military thought. (II)

A fine style is an invisible but tremendous force. Cultivating the Three-Eight Style is a work of great strategic significance. Marshal Lin Biao said: In building our army, on the one hand, we must carry out construction materially, constantly improve our army's technical equipment, and enhance our army's combat effectiveness; on the other hand, we must also carry out spiritual construction. Once spiritual things are transformed into the conscious actions of the broad masses, they become a powerful material force. Marshal Lin Biao's words vividly and profoundly tell us that cultivating the fine style of the troops is an extremely important task in our army's construction.

With a fine style, the troops will be able to overwhelm all enemies in wartime, be invincible, unbreakable, sure to conquer, and sure to defend, and exchange small sacrifices for great victories. This truth can be best proved by the history of our army's heroic struggle over the past 30 years. In the world-renowned 25,000-li Long March, our army overcame countless unimaginable hardships, repelled the blocking and pursuit of hundreds of thousands of enemy troops, and achieved an unprecedented victory. In the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, the Chinese People's Volunteers fought one after another, unyielding and indomitable, continuously fought in the severe cold of minus 30 degrees Celsius and on the high mountains with snow several feet deep, and endured hunger and cold with a handful of fried noodles and a handful of snow, and finally defeated the most ferocious and armed-to-the-teeth US aggressors of the time. These earth-shattering deeds eloquently demonstrate that our army's fine style is an indestructible combat force.

With a fine style, the troops can mobilize all positive factors in peacetime, pool the wisdom and efforts of the masses, unite as one, overcome all difficulties, and complete various tasks more, faster, better, and more economically. Recently, although the movement to cultivate the Three-Eight Style in the troops has not been carried out for a long time, once our army's fine style is carried forward, the organs and companies will appear vigorous and lively, and vigorously promote the great leap forward in various tasks. As someone wrote in a poem: "The Three-Eight Style has a long source, shining brightly in revolutionary history, and now the flowers are even redder, and the wind blows thousands of miles, fragrant all over the land!"

A fine style also has an important educational role that subtly influences people. It is like a communist furnace that can quickly train new members into strong revolutionary fighters, so that old members can always maintain excellent qualities.

Carrying forward our army's fine style will also help to better cultivate and carry forward the communist style among the broad masses of the people. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have repeatedly advocated that the people's communes should implement "militarization of organization, combatization of action, collectivization of life, and democratization of management." This is to universally promote and carry forward among the broad masses of the people our fine military tradition cultivated through long-term revolutionary struggle. The experience of running militia divisions in a big way fully proves that the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao are completely correct. Carrying forward this fine tradition among the broad masses of the people has not only become a huge force for promoting production and construction; but is also having a far-reaching impact on changing customs and habits.

In summary, it can be seen that although the three sentences and eight characters are a few old words, they always radiate brilliant brilliance and always maintain combat power. Therefore, cultivating and carrying forward our army's Three-Eight Style has extremely far-reaching significance for our army's construction. (III)

The Three-Eight Style is our army's fine tradition. Carrying forward this fine style is of great significance whether in the past, at present, or in the future. But this style does not grow naturally, it must be cultivated consciously, regularly, and under leadership.

To cultivate the Three-Eight Style, we must first strengthen ideological education and ideological struggle. Ideology is the foundation of style. The Three-Eight Style is cultivated in the continuous struggle between the proletarian ideological style and various non-proletarian ideological styles. Therefore, to cultivate the Three-Eight Style, we must break down the old and establish the new, and promote the proletariat and eliminate the bourgeoisie. If we do not eliminate bad ideological styles, we cannot better cultivate and carry forward our army's fine style. To establish the Three-Eight Style in a big way, we must conscientiously study Chairman Mao's works. Only by earnestly studying Chairman Mao's works can we continuously improve the political consciousness and ideological level of all officers and soldiers, so as to lay a good ideological foundation for cultivating the Three-Eight Style. To cultivate and carry forward the Three-Eight Style, we must also always pay attention to commending and encouraging advanced units and advanced figures who maintain and carry forward our army's fine traditions, establish pacesetters, and promote the entire army.

To cultivate a fine style, we must also vigorously carry out mass movements. To make the three sentences and eight characters become the conscious actions of the broad masses of officers and soldiers. Everyone should talk about style, everyone should talk about style in everything, and everyone should manage style. We must advocate that everyone is responsible, everyone speaks, everyone criticizes, and everyone praises. Only through such mass movements can our army's fine style be carried forward more quickly and better.

Cultivating a fine style requires both large-scale mass movements in a certain period of time and long-term habit formation and practical exercise.

An important key to cultivating a fine style is the leadership of the Party committee and the leading role of cadres. Party committees at all levels must always pay attention to grasping the issue of style. Cadres setting an example and the exemplary actions of leaders have a very important role in cultivating the fine style of the troops.

Comrades! As long as the entire army actively takes action, it can be expected that our army's fine tradition - the Three-Eight Style, will surely be carried forward and developed; our army's construction cause will surely continue to leap forward better!

    培养三八作风是我军建设的重要任务
    萧华上将在解放军文化教育积极分子代表大会上的报告（摘要）
    新华社22日讯　中国人民解放军总政治部副主任萧华上将在全军文化教育积极分子代表大会上作了“培养三八作风是我军建设的重要任务”的报告，摘要如下：
    全军正在轰轰烈烈地开展培养三八作风的运动，这是我军当前的一件大事情，也是我军现代化建设的一项重要任务。这次大会，不仅是推动我军文化教育工作继续跃进的动员大会，而且也应当成为在全军开展培养三八作风运动的动员大会。全体代表同志，不仅是我军开展文化教育工作的骨干，而且应当成为培养和发扬三八作风的积极分子。（一）
    我军在党和毛主席的领导下，在长期的艰苦的革命斗争中，养成了一种优良的传统作风。毛主席把这种作风概括为三句话和八个字。三句话是：坚定正确的政治方向，艰苦朴素的工作作风，灵活机动的战略战术；八个字是：团结、紧张、严肃、活泼。这种优良作风，是毛泽东军事思想的重要组成部分，是人民军队本质的集中表现，也是我军能够在极端困难的条件下，战胜国内外强大敌人和完成各项工作任务的一个重要因素。
    三句话和八个字，语言虽然简单、朴素，但却包含了极其丰富、深刻的思想。它明确而完整地概括了我军优良传统作风的主要内容。
    我军每一个官兵，都要有坚定正确的政治方向。我军是中国共产党绝对领导的为中国人民革命服务的武装集团。我军的最高理想是在中国和全世界实现共产主义。正确地领导我们向着这个伟大而崇高的目标前进的，是党和毛主席。因此，我们每个革命军人，都应该有为共产主义事业奋斗到底的雄心大志；都应该听党的话，听毛主席的话，朝着党和毛主席指示的方向，遵循着党的总路线，一步一步地向最终目标奋勇前进。毛主席经常告诫我们，任何时候都不能忘记我们的总目标、总路线。为了更快更好地实现我们的崇高理想，为了始终如一地坚持正确的政治方向，全体官兵，必须努力学习马克思列宁主义，学习毛泽东著作，确立无产阶级世界观，清除资产阶级世界观的影响；必须坚定地站稳无产阶级立场；必须树立不断革命思想；必须对革命的敌人有高度仇恨，在对敌斗争中，英勇顽强，宁死不屈；必须全心全意为人民服务，为革命事业贡献出自己的一切力量；必须坚决执行党的政治路线、军事路线和各项政策，并且向一切违背党的路线、政策的倾向作不调和的斗争。在现阶段，特别要高举总路线、大跃进和人民公社三面红旗，为彻底完成社会主义革命，加速进行社会主义建设，逐步向共产主义过渡而斗争！为反对帝国主义，反对现代修正主义，保卫马克思列宁主义，保卫世界和平而斗争！
    全军官兵还要有艰苦朴素的工作作风。艰苦朴素是我们无产阶级的本色。在战争年代，正是由于我们发扬了艰苦朴素的优良传统，才克服了许多令人难以想像的艰难困苦，从胜利走向胜利；今后仍然必须发扬这种作风，勇往直前，战胜前进道路上的一切困难，争取更大的胜利。为此，全军同志必须在工作中有实事求是的科学态度，深入调查研究，刻苦钻研问题，从实际出发，按照客观规律办事，把冲天的干劲与科学分析精神结合起来。艰苦朴素的工作作风，还要求我们厉行节约，勤俭建国，勤俭建军，勤俭办一切事业，并且要勤俭持家，生活朴素，与人民群众同甘共苦。
    我军在长期革命战争中，在毛泽东军事思想的教导下，形成了一套人民战争所必需的灵活机动的战略战术。这是我军的克敌致胜之宝。毛主席经常强调，要善于按照变化着的具体条件，活用战略战术原则，对什么敌人打什么仗，有什么武器打什么仗，在什么条件下打什么仗，以我之长，攻敌之短，在战争中高度发挥主观能动性。为此，必须树立积极歼敌的思想；必须对客观情况做具体分析；必须积极学习毛主席的战略战术思想，总结我军经验，贯彻执行中央军委的战略方针。
    团结，就是要求我军官兵之间、上下之间、部门之间、友邻之间、军政之间，都要政治一致、思想一致、行动一致。要求我军与人民群众之间、与地方政府机关、团体之间，互相尊重，互相帮助，亲密无间。还要搞好和兄弟国家的人民与军队的国际主义团结。团结就是力量。团结是党的生命，是马克思列宁主义的基本原则。团结必须是也只能是团结在党中央和毛主席的周围，必须是也只能是以马克思列宁主义为基础。大家都坚决执行党中央和毛主席的路线、政策、方针、指示，才能同心协力团结一致。要搞好团结，还必须提倡“见困难就上，见荣誉就让，见先进就学，见后进就帮”的共产主义风格，发扬“一人有事，万人相助，一处困难，八方支援”的共产主义协作精神。要搞好团结，还要树立全局观点，顾大局识大体。要搞好团结，还要有谦虚态度。要搞好团结，还必须坚持我军的民主制度，健全民主生活，发扬我军官兵同吃、同住、同劳动、同操作、同娱乐的光荣传统。
    紧张，就是要求我们干劲冲天，雷厉风行，斗志昂扬，意气风发，力争上游，力争高速度。紧张地工作，高速度地跃进，已经成为我们生活的常规。时间是一种力量，平时工作如此，战时更是如此。“兵贵神速”。因此，我们特别要强调时间观念，强调行动迅速；要养成力争上游、力争高速度的作风。紧张，还要讲究工作方法，提高工作效率，加强工作计划性，开展技术革新和技术革命运动，充分发挥群众的智慧，把苦干与巧干结合起来。又要有劳有逸，有突击，也有必要的休整，使各项工作有节奏地持续跃进。还要注意工作质量，绝不粗制滥造。总之，事情要办得又多又快，又好又省。
    严肃，就是要求每一个同志具有高度的原则性。有没有原则性，是考验每个共产党员和革命战士政治是否坚定、对党是否忠诚的重要标准。我军官兵，不但在火线上要坚决勇敢，歼灭敌人；而且在政治思想战线上也应该坚决勇敢地对一切错误思想倾向进行斗争。严肃，不仅要对别人的错误思想坚决斗争，而且更重要的，是每一个同志都要有高度的自我批评精神，严格要求自己。严肃，还要求我们对待工作要认真负责，老老实实，兢兢业业，埋头苦干，任劳任怨。严肃，又要求部队有严格的纪律。这样，才能使我军成为最有原则、最有纪律，在政治思想上高度统一的部队。
    活泼，就是要求我军官兵生龙活虎，朝气勃勃，精神焕发，心情舒畅。活泼，还要求我军官兵，高度发扬革命的创造性，永远保持旺盛的政治热情和进取精神，对革命事业怀有无限信心，充满乐观主义精神。这是发挥一切积极因素，提高工作效率，完成各项任务的必要条件。
    三八作风是人民军队本质的集中表现。毛主席早就指出：我军是一个执行革命的政治任务的武装集团。“紧紧地和中国人民站在一起，全心全意地为中国人民服务”，是我军唯一的宗旨。这就决定了，我军必须具有坚定正确的政治方向，艰苦朴素的工作作风，灵活机动的战略战术，以及团结、紧张、严肃、活泼的作风。这种作风，是马克思主义的作风。这种作风的形成，是毛主席人民军队、人民战争的思想为我军广大官兵所掌握，并经过长期革命斗争的实践培养起来的。它是毛泽东军事思想的重要组成部分。（二）
    优良的作风是无形的巨大的力量。培养三八作风，是具有重要战略意义的工作。林彪元帅说：我们建军，一方面要在物质上进行建设，不断改善我军的技术装备，增强我军的战斗威力；另一方面，还要进行精神上的建设。精神的东西一旦变成广大群众自觉的行动，就成为强大的物质力量。林彪元帅的这些话，生动而又深刻地告诉了我们，培养部队的优良作风，是我军建设上一项极其重要的任务。
    部队有了优良作风，在战时就能够压倒一切敌人，打不垮，拖不烂，攻必克，守必坚，以小的代价换取大的胜利。这个真理，从我军三十多年来英勇斗争的历史上可以得到最好的证明。我军在举世闻名的二万五千里长征中，克服了无数令人难以想像的艰难困苦，杀退了数十万敌兵的拦阻、追击，取得了史无前例的胜利。中国人民志愿军，在抗美援朝战争中，前仆后继，顽强不屈，在零下三十度严寒中和积雪数尺的高山上连续作战，在一把炒面一把雪的情况下忍饥受冻，终于打败了当代最凶恶的、武装到牙齿的美国侵略者。这些惊天动地的事迹，雄辩地表明：我军的优良作风，是一种坚不可摧的战斗力量。
    部队有了优良的作风，在平时就能调动一切积极因素，群策群力，万众一心，克服一切困难，多快好省地完成各种工作任务。最近，部队培养三八作风的运动虽然开展不久，但我军的优良作风一经发扬起来，就使机关、连队出现朝气勃勃、生龙活虎的景象，有力地促进了各项工作的跃进。正如有人写诗所说：“三八作风源流长，革命史上放光芒，如今开花花更红，风吹万里遍地香！”
    优良的作风，还具有潜移默化的重要教育作用。它好比是一个共产主义的大熔炉，能把新的成员迅速锻炼成坚强的革命战士，使老的成员也能永远保持优良的品质。
    发扬我军的优良作风，还有助于在广大人民群众中，更好地培养和发扬共产主义的风格。党中央、毛主席曾经一再倡导人民公社要实行“组织军事化、行动战斗化、生活集体化、管理民主化”。这就是要把我们经过长期革命斗争培养起来的优良军事传统，在广大人民群众中普遍发扬光大。大办民兵师的经验充分证明，党中央、毛主席的指示，是完全正确的。在广大人民群众中发扬这种优良传统，不但已经成为推动生产建设的巨大力量；而且正在发生移风易俗的深远影响。
    综上所述，可以看到，三句话八个字虽然是几句老话，可是它永远放射着灿烂的光彩，始终保持着战斗的威力。因此，培养和发扬我军的三八作风，对我军建设具有极其深远的意义。（三）
    三八作风，是我军的优良传统。发扬这种优良作风，无论在过去、在当前、还是在今后，都有十分重大的意义。但是这种作风并不是自生自长起来的，必须自觉地、经常地、有领导地加以培养。
    培养三八作风，首先必须加强思想教育和思想斗争。思想是作风的基础。三八作风是无产阶级思想作风同各种非无产阶级思想作风不断进行斗争中培养起来的。因此，我们要培养三八作风，必须大破大立，兴无灭资。不破除坏的思想作风，就不能更好地培养和发扬我军的优良作风。要大立三八作风，必须认真学习毛主席的著作。只有认真的学习毛主席著作，才能不断提高全军官兵的政治觉悟和思想水平，从而为培养三八作风打好思想基础。要培养和发扬三八作风，还必须经常注意表扬和鼓励那些保持和发扬我军优良传统的先进单位和先进人物，树立标兵，推动全军。
    培养优良作风还必须大力开展群众运动。使三句话八个字变成全军广大官兵自觉的行动。要人人讲作风，事事讲作风，个个管作风。要提倡人人负责，人人开口，人人批评，人人表扬。只有通过这样的群众运动，才会更快更好地把我军的优良作风发扬起来。
    培养优良作风，既要在一定时期内大搞群众运动，又要靠长期的养成教育和实际锻炼。
    培养优良作风的一个重要关键，是党委领导，干部带头。各级党委必须经常注意抓作风问题。干部以身作则，领导者的模范行动，对培养部队的优良作风，具有十分重要的作用。
    同志们！只要全军上下都积极行动起来，可以预期，我军的优良传统——三八作风，一定能够发扬光大；我军的建设事业，一定能够更好地持续跃进！
