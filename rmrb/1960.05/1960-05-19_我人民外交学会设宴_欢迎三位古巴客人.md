Xinhua News Agency, 18th: The Vice President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, Hu Yuzhi, hosted a banquet on the evening of the 17th to warmly welcome three figures from the Cuban "July 26th Movement" who are currently visiting China. They are: Fernando López Muñío, Director of Secondary Education of the Cuban Ministry of Education; Fernando Luis, Mayor of Santiago de Cuba; and Manuel Luzardo, Finance Secretary of the "July 26th Movement."

In his speech at the banquet, Hu Yuzhi expressed his deep admiration for the heroic struggle of the Cuban people against U.S. imperialism. He said, "The Chinese people wholeheartedly support the struggle of the Cuban people. We regard the struggle of the Cuban people as our own struggle." He expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the Cuban people for their support of the Chinese people.

Hu Yuzhi firmly believes that the friendly visit of the three Cuban guests to China will further enhance mutual understanding between the people of China and Cuba and will help strengthen the friendship between the two peoples.

In his speech, Fernando López Muñío said enthusiastically: "The destinies of the Cuban people and the Chinese people are closely linked, although our skin color, language, habits, and the size of our countries are different, and although we are geographically so far apart. Like the path of the Chinese people's struggle, the Cuban people have long fought against dictators supported by imperialism, against the giants of Wall Street in the United States, the common enemy of the Cuban and Chinese people, and we have achieved victory. This makes the unity of our two peoples even closer."

During the banquet, the guests and hosts engaged in cordial conversations. People constantly toasted the victory of the heroic struggle of the Cuban people standing on the front lines against U.S. imperialism, and to the growing friendship between the Chinese and Cuban peoples.

    我人民外交学会设宴
    欢迎三位古巴客人
    据新华社18日讯　中国人民外交学会副会长胡愈之17日晚设宴热烈欢迎正在我国访问的三位古巴“7月26日运动”人士。他们是：古巴教育部中等教育司司长费尔南多·洛佩斯·穆尼奥，古巴圣地亚哥市市长费尔南多·路易斯，“7月26日运动”财务秘书曼努埃尔·苏萨耳迪。
    胡愈之在宴会上的致词中，对英勇的古巴人民反对美帝国主义的斗争表示深深的钦佩。他说：“中国人民十二分地热烈支持古巴人民的斗争。我们把古巴人民的斗争看作是我们自己的斗争。”他衷心地感谢古巴人民对中国人民的支持。
    胡愈之深信，三位古巴客人这次来我国进行的友好访问，将进一步增进中国和古巴两国人民之间的相互了解，将有助于加强两国人民的友谊。
    费尔南多·洛佩斯·穆尼奥在讲话中热情地说：“古巴人民和中国人民的命运是密切相连的，尽管我们之间的肤色、语言、习惯、国家的大、小都不相同，尽管我们在地理上相隔这样遥远。同中国人民的斗争道路一样，古巴人民长期以来进行了反对帝国主义支持的独裁者的斗争，反对古巴和中国人民共同的敌人美国华尔街的巨头们的斗争，我们取得了胜利。这就使我们两国人民的团结更加紧密。”
    席间，宾主亲切交谈。人们不断为站在反对美帝国主义最前线的古巴人民英勇斗争的胜利，为日益增长的中、古两国人民之间的友谊干杯。
