    Who First Extracted Aluminum?
    Yan Huo
    Aluminum is a relatively reactive metal, making it difficult to extract. Its history of familiarity to people is less than a hundred years. In 1886, French chemist Paul Héroult and American scientist Charles Martin Hall simultaneously invented the electrolytic method for extracting aluminum from sodium and aluminum chlorides, opening the door for large-scale industrial production and widespread application of aluminum.
    Who was the first person to smelt aluminum? In the past, it was generally believed to be Danish and German individuals in the 1830s. However, artifacts excavated in recent years indicate that this statement is incorrect. The history of aluminum extraction can be traced back to around the 3rd century AD, and this achievement should be attributed to the working people of the Jin Dynasty in China.
    In 1956, archaeologists excavated a garment belt from an ancient tomb in Yixing, Jiangsu – the pottery capital. The owner of this belt was the Jin Dynasty general Zhou Chu (died in battle in 297 AD). Zhou Chu is a famous figure in folk legends, the protagonist of the Peking Opera "Eliminating Three Evils." People discovered many metal ornaments on the belt of this General Zhou, and after testing, found that some of them were made of silver, while others were aluminum-copper alloys, containing 85% aluminum. At the time, some scientific workers were reluctant to believe this conclusion. However, after multiple tests over the past few years, it has undoubtedly proven this fact to be correct. It demonstrates the outstanding achievements of our working people in metallurgy.

    谁最早提炼出铝？
    言火
    铝是金属中比较活泼的元素，所以不易提炼。它为人们熟悉的历史还不到一百年。一八八六年法国化学家赫罗尔特和美国科学家豪尔同时发明了用电解法从钠、铝的氯化物中提炼铝，才给工业上大量生产铝与广泛应用铝打开了大门。
    谁是最早炼出铝的人呢？过去一般人认为是十九世纪三十年代的丹麦人和德国人。可是近几年从地下发掘的物品表明这个说法是不正确的。提炼铝的历史可以上溯到公元三世纪左右，而这个功绩应当归功于晋代的中国劳动人民。
    一九五六年考古工作者从陶都——江苏宜兴的古墓葬中发掘到一围衣带。这围衣带的主人是晋朝将军周处（二九七年战死）。周处是民间传说中有名的人物，也就是京剧“除三害”中的主角。人们从这位周将军的衣带上发现有很多块金属做的带饰，经过化验发现其中有些块是银做的，而有些块却是铝铜的合金，其中含铝百分之八十五。当时有些科学工作者不敢相信这个结论。可是经过这几年来的多次化验却无可怀疑地说明了这个事实是正确的。它显示出我国劳动人民在冶金方面的杰出成就。
