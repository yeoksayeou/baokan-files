Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa -- Spring planting work in Tibet has basically concluded. By the end of April, over 85% of Tibet's total cultivated land had been sown with crops such as highland barley, wheat, buckwheat, broad beans, and rapeseed. On the banks of the Yarlung Zangbo River and the Lhasa River, as well as in the lower reaches of the Lancang River, the seedlings of various crops are already growing very sturdily.

The spring planting work in most areas of Tibet started in full swing in late March, just after the land thawed, about half a month earlier than in previous years. Tibetan and Han leading cadres at all levels went deep into the fields and worked alongside Tibetan farmers. Several thousand mutual aid teams promoted the spirit of great collaboration, with later-planting areas supporting earlier-planting areas, and earlier-planting areas assisting later-planting areas, and launched a large-scale appraisal and competition. Farmers in various areas expanded the cultivated land area by more than 200,000 "ke" by opening up wasteland, eliminating fallow land, reducing the corners of fields, and utilizing roadside and house-side open spaces.

The land sown this spring was generally fertilized with 5,000 to 15,000 jin of base fertilizer, plowed three or four times, and cleared of stones and weeds, ensuring that the land was level. Most of the fields had interconnected water channels and were laid out in square plots suitable for irrigation. The backward state of extensive cultivation that had persisted for thousands of years has undergone great changes. In particular, the tens of thousands of "ke" of "high-yield fields" sown throughout the region are a major characteristic of agricultural production in Tibet this year.

Currently, agricultural production mutual aid teams in various areas are carrying out mass seedling inspection, replanting, and seedling protection activities, and have launched a surge in the large-scale accumulation of topdressing fertilizer, the large-scale manufacturing of intertillage farm tools and fertilizer application tools, determined to fight a beautiful battle in field management and strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture this year.

    西藏春播基本结束幼苗生长茁壮
    据新华社拉萨电　西藏春播工作基本结束。到4月底止，占西藏耕地总面积85％以上的土地已经种上了青稞、小麦、荞麦、蚕豆和油菜等农作物。雅鲁藏布江和拉萨河两岸以及澜沧江下游，各种农作物的幼苗已经长得十分茁壮。
    今年3月下旬土地刚一解冻，西藏大部分地区的春播工作就已全面展开，比往年提早了半个月左右。各地藏、汉族领导干部都深入田间，同藏族农民一起劳动。几千个互助组发扬大协作精神，由晚播区支援早播区，早播区协助晚播区，并且展开了大评比、大竞赛。各地农民用开垦荒地，取消休歇地，缩小地角田边，利用路旁宅旁空地等办法，共扩大了耕地面积二十多万克。
    今年春种的土地一般都施了五千到一万五千斤底肥，翻耕了三、四遍，清除了石块杂草，作到了土地平整。大部分田里水渠相通，打有方畦可以灌溉。千百年来耕作粗放的落后状况有了很大改变。尤其是全区播种的几万克“丰产田”，更是今年西藏农业生产上的大特色。
    目前，各地农业生产互助组都在开展群众性的查苗、补苗和护苗活动，并且掀起了大积追肥、大制中耕农具和施肥农具的热潮，决心在田间管理上打一个漂亮仗，争取今年农业大丰收。
