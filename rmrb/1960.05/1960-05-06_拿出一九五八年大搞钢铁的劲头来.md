	Bring out the Spirit of Making Steel in a Big Way Like in 1958
	To bring out the spirit and momentum of the Great Leap Forward in steel production like in 1958, to quickly set off a vigorous and solid new upsurge in steel production, and to take steel, iron, and coal as the center to drive the overall leap forward of the entire industrial front. This has become an extremely urgent task for the entire Party and all the people in our province.
	Developing steel production at the highest speed and ensuring the completion of the steel production tasks for the second quarter will not only elevate our province's steel industry to a new level but will also greatly promote and guarantee the development of the entire national economy. Because only by producing more iron, more steel, and more steel products can we better accelerate the technological transformation of agriculture, speed up capital construction, the manufacture of machinery and equipment, and accelerate the construction of local railways; only then can we guarantee the growing needs of national steel production and various construction undertakings. Winning time is victory. We must establish the idea of ​​catching up and not falling behind, grasp tightly, relentlessly, and carry it through to the end, and make the greatest effort to ensure the early and over-fulfillment of steel, iron, and coal production tasks.
	In the new upsurge of steel production, all enterprises must combine production with vigorous technological transformation, implement the spirit of self-reliance, the combination of indigenous and foreign methods, and mutual cooperation, and carry out comprehensive planning and phased concentrated efforts. Currently, we should focus on the blast furnace as the center, promoting the transformation of all aspects before, after, left, and right, such as ore, coking, and transportation. In order to develop steel production at high speed, all regions must also fully utilize the potential of existing equipment. Small blast furnaces that have been basically completed but not yet put into production, or those that have been put into production but have stopped production midway, should be immediately put into production and restored to production; in all places with coal and iron resource conditions and places where production capacity is insufficient, a new batch of blast furnaces should be added in a planned manner; places without these conditions should also actively create conditions or cooperate with other places to get things done, so that special districts, counties, and communes can all engage in steel production.
	In order to ensure the high-speed and continuous leap forward in steel production in the second quarter, it is necessary to focus on the key points in current production. What are the key points on the steel front at present? They are mainly in six aspects: coal, iron, ore, transportation, electricity, and machinery repair. Facts have proved that only by grasping these aspects and doing a good job can steel production develop faster, better, and more economically. First of all, we must strive to increase the production of coal coke and ore, accelerate the technological transformation of small coal mines, accelerate the construction of iron mines, implement graded mine construction, and continuously increase the yield per unit area and the efficiency of tunneling; carry out large-scale simple sintering and indigenous sintering and make full use of accumulated ore fines. Secondly, we must continue to strengthen the repair and maintenance of highway surfaces, implement bridge reinforcement, accelerate the construction of local railways, earnestly improve internal and external transportation and short-distance transportation, rapidly improve loading and unloading tools and equipment, strengthen road-factory cooperation, and improve the attendance rate and integrity rate of vehicles. Other aspects, such as saving electricity, actively expanding power sources, strengthening equipment maintenance and repair, and doing a good job in the supply of spare parts and components, must be given high priority.

### 拿出一九五八年大搞钢铁的劲头来

    拿出一九五八年大搞钢铁的劲头来
    拿出像1958年大闹钢铁那样的劲头和气势来，迅速掀起一个轰轰烈烈、扎扎实实的钢铁生产新高潮，并以钢、铁、煤为中心，带动整个工业战线全面跃进。这已成为当前我省全党全民一个万分迫切的任务了。
    用最高的速度发展钢铁生产，确保第二季度钢铁生产任务的完成，不仅将使我省钢铁工业跃上一个新的水平，而且将对整个国民经济的发展，起着极大的促进和保证作用。因为只有多产铁、多产钢和钢材，才能更好地加速农业技术改造，加快基本建设、机械设备制造以及加快地方铁路的兴建；才能保证国家炼钢生产和各项建设事业日益增长的需要。赢得时间就是胜利。我们必须树立赶前不赶后的思想，抓紧、抓狠、一抓到底，尽最大的努力确保钢、铁、煤生产任务提前超额完成。
    在钢铁生产的新高潮中，各个企业必须结合生产狠抓技术改造，贯彻自力更生、土洋结合、互相协作的精神，全面规划，分期分批地进行突击。当前应着重以高炉为中心，推动矿石、焦化、运输等前后左右各个环节的改造。为了高速度发展钢铁生产，各个地区还要充分发挥原有的设备潜力。已基本建成尚未投入生产，或者已投入生产而又中途停止生产的小高炉，应立即投入生产和恢复生产；在一切有煤铁资源条件的地方和生产能力不够的地方，都应有计划地增建一批新的高炉；没有这些条件的地方，也应该积极创造条件或与别地协作来搞，做到专区、县、公社都能搞起钢铁生产来。
    为了保证第二季度钢铁生产高速度持续跃进，必须狠抓当前生产中的关键。钢铁战线上当前的关键是什么呢？主要是煤、铁、矿、运、电、机修等六个方面。事实证明，只有这几方面抓住了，抓好了，钢铁生产才可能多快好省地向前发展。首先必须努力增产煤焦和矿石，加速小煤窑技术改造，加速铁矿建设，实行逐级建矿，不断地提高单位面积产量和掘进效率；大搞简易烧结和土法烧结。充分利用积存的粉矿。其次，必须继续加强公路路面整修和维护，实行桥梁加固，加速地方铁路的建设，认真改进厂内外运输和短途运输，迅速改进装卸工具设备，加强路厂协作，提高车辆的出勤率和完好率。其他如节约用电，积极扩大电源，加强设备维护检修，做好配品备件的供应工作等，都必须给以高度重视。　（摘自江西日报）
