    (Reported by this newspaper) On May 2nd at noon, at the agricultural tool repair factory of the Duoba People's Commune in Xining City. Workers from the Xining Agricultural and Pastoral Machinery Factory arrived early in the morning with various gifts to install an electric spring hammer with the workers of the commune's agricultural tool repair factory, ready for a demonstration.

    When the belt on the motor was installed and the switch turned on, as the motor roared, the double hammers of the electric spring hammer rose and fell together, powerfully forging the red-hot iron block placed on the anvil. The commune members watching around immediately burst into applause, warmly congratulating the achievement of this technical innovation.

    In order to reduce the heavy physical labor of the forging workers, the workers of the Xining Agricultural and Pastoral Machinery Factory had only recently made this first electric spring hammer. However, when they learned that the workers of the Duoba People's Commune agricultural tool repair factory were still using heavy iron hammers to forge various agricultural tools, they decided to give it to the commune as the most precious gift for the "May Day" holiday.

    工农友谊的珍贵礼物
    本报讯　5月2日中午，在西宁市哆吧人民公社农具修配厂后面的空地上。西宁农牧机械厂的工人们，一大早就带着各种礼物来到这里和公社农具修配厂的工人们一起，把电动弹簧锤安装起来，准备表演。
    当马达上的皮带装好，电门打开，随着马达的轰鸣，电动弹簧锤的双锤一起一落，有力地锻打着放在铁砧上的烧红的铁块时，在周围观看的社员们，立即响起了一片掌声，热烈祝贺这一技术革新的成就。
    西宁农牧机械厂为了减轻锻工笨重的体力劳动，职工们在不久以前，才制成了这个第一台电动弹簧锤。但是当他们知道哆吧人民公社农具修配厂的工人仍在使用笨重的铁锤打造各种农具时，便决定把它作为“五一”节的最珍贵的礼物赠给这个公社了。
