    Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 12th – The people of Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, who once suffered deeply under the iron heel of Japanese invaders, are today completely enraged by the US-Japan reactionaries’ plot for a new war. Today, 160,000 people from all walks of life held massive rallies and demonstrations in different districts this afternoon, firmly supporting the Japanese people’s just struggle against the US-Japan military alliance treaty.
    The banks of West Lake, Hubin Road and Nanshan Road, were filled with dense crowds. Slogans of "Oppose the US-Japan Military Alliance Treaty!" "Oppose the Revival of Japanese Militarism!" "Yankee Go Home from Japan!" and "Down with US Imperialism!" resounded continuously around West Lake. Among the thousands of fully armed and high-spirited militia members, at the forefront was Zheng Peiyuan, a delegate to the National Militia Congress and instructor of the militia company of the Grain Retail Department in Shangcheng District, Hangzhou. His father was stabbed by Japanese bayonets, his mother was raped, and his house was burned. Old and new hatreds intertwined, he gripped his gun tightly, angrily warning that if the US-Japan reactionaries dared to invade China again, the Chinese people, armed by the whole nation, would resolutely wipe them out completely. Huang Shuimiao, the leader of the Women's Militia Company of Hangzhou No. 9 Middle School, and also a delegate to the National Militia Congress, lost two older sisters who died while fleeing when the Japanese invaders entered. Today, she led her entire company of women militia members at the front of the demonstration, shouting loudly, "Down with US Imperialism!" In Gongshu District in the northwest corner of Hangzhou, which was set on fire by the Japanese invaders more than ten times, destroying nearly a thousand civilian houses, and causing many deaths, workers, students and members of the Gongshu Commune participated in the demonstration, angrily denouncing the monstrous crimes of the Japanese invaders in those years, and expressing their firm opposition to the US-Japan reactionaries’ plot for a new war. Yang Zhaodi, a female worker at the Hangzhou Silk United Factory, whose father was severely injured and died, denounced the murder of her father and expressed her determination to support the Japanese people's just struggle with practical actions.
    At 3 p.m., the rallies were held in different districts. The central venue was located at the People's Hall Square, with more than 40,000 people participating. Leaders from provincial and municipal Party and government organs, people's organizations, and universities attended the rally. Some international friends visiting Hangzhou also participated. Wang Pingyi, member of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee and secretary of the Secretariat of the Hangzhou Municipal Party Committee, spoke at the rally on behalf of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee and the Hangzhou Municipal Party Committee. He said that after 1937, vast areas of Zhejiang Province successively fell under the iron heel of Japanese invaders. They implemented bloody rule over the people of Zhejiang, bombing, massacring, raping, plundering, and inhumanely carrying out germ warfare against peaceful people, causing severe devastation to the lives and property of the people of Zhejiang. We will never forget the countless blood debts owed by Japanese militarism. Wang Pingyi, on behalf of the people of Zhejiang Province and Hangzhou City, expressed firm support for the just struggle of the Japanese people. He said that US imperialism is the common enemy of the people of China and Japan, and the people of the world. US imperialism is frantically engaged in arms expansion and war preparations, plotting new aggressive schemes everywhere, and even openly sending planes to the Soviet Union for espionage activities, fully proving that it is playing a despicable trick of feigning peace while truly preparing for war. Wang Pingyi's speech was constantly interrupted by applause and slogans from the crowd. Liu Dan, vice chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace, leaders of various people's organizations and democratic parties in Zhejiang Province, and representatives of workers, peasants, and students also spoke at the rally, all expressing their firm support for the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle against the United States.
    The rally finally adopted a telegram to the Japanese people.
    Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 12th – 150,000 people from all walks of life in Taiyuan City, Shanxi Province, held a grand rally and demonstration today, firmly supporting the Japanese people's just struggle against the US-Japan military alliance treaty. In the mighty demonstration, there were anti-Japanese heroes who had fought bloody battles with the Japanese invaders in the Taihang Mountains and the Lüliang Mountains, families of martyrs who had their loved ones taken away by Japanese fascist bandits, and people who had testified in military tribunals to try Japanese war criminals. Today, they all angrily waved their fists, shouting the slogan "Oppose the Revival of Japanese Militarism," and participated in the demonstration.
    Li Dechang, a special-class militia hero from the Taiyue area during the Anti-Japanese War, participated in the demonstration today. From the winter of 1942 to the spring of 1945, he led a militia team in the Yupi Gully in the Taiyue Mountains to conduct more than 100 battles of all sizes with the Japanese invading army, killing and wounding more than 300 invaders. He said: "Today, US imperialism is establishing military bases in Japan and forming a military alliance with Japanese reactionaries. This is a provocation to the Chinese people, and we absolutely cannot allow it." Zhen Rongdian, a famous "cannonball king" in the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region during the Anti-Japanese War, said: We were able to produce many cannonballs under such difficult conditions in the past to strike at the Japanese invaders, and today we are fully capable of safeguarding world peace.
    Shi Jiyan, member of the Standing Committee of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee and vice chairman of the Shanxi Provincial Branch of the Chinese Committee for the Defense of World Peace, addressed the demonstrating masses. He pointed out: We will never allow the revival of Japanese militarism. The people of Shanxi, together with the people of all of China, firmly support the Japanese people's just struggle against the US-Japan military alliance treaty.
    After the speech, 150,000 people held a massive parade despite the strong wind. The angry shouts of the people reverberated for a long time in this industrial city.
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 12th – Nanning City, Guangxi, which once suffered cruel bombing and plunder by Japanese militarists, today had more than 60,000 people braving the summer heat to hold demonstrations and mass rallies, firmly supporting the Japanese people's just struggle against the US-Japan military alliance treaty.
    More than 60,000 demonstrators gathered at the autonomous region's stadium this afternoon to hold a mass rally in support of the Japanese people's struggle against the US-Japan military alliance treaty. Qin Yingji, Secretary of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, attended today's meeting. Yan Guangcai, Secretary of the Nanning Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke at the meeting. He said: The US-Japan military alliance treaty signed by US imperialism and Japanese militarists seriously threatens the security of China, the Soviet Union, and Asian countries. But people clearly see that the era of imperialism's reckless behavior is gone forever. Final victory will surely belong to the Japanese people and the people of the world.
    Yan Guangcai's speech was constantly interrupted by slogans from the crowd. Tan Ruiqiong, a 62-year-old mother, excitedly shouted: "Yankee go home from Japan!" She said sadly to the people around her, "When I mention Japanese imperialism, the tragedy of my family is right before my eyes." She said that when Japanese imperialist planes bombed Nanning in 1939, they destroyed her home. Her family of thirteen had to leave their hometown and flee to a remote mountain gully. They drank sewage and ate wild vegetables there, and four of them died in a little over a year. She took eight children and wandered for more than three years before returning to Nanning. She said: "Today, the United States wants to revive Japanese militarism again. Our whole family will never allow this kind of sinful behavior. We wholeheartedly support the Japanese people's struggle against the US-Japan reactionaries' plot for a new war." Zhou Xueying, a female worker at the binding and processing factory of the Zhongshan People's Commune, recounted to the people the experience of her family being persecuted and scattered in Guilin by the Japanese invading army sixteen years ago. She said: I still don't know the whereabouts of one of my daughters, and US imperialism wants to revive the evil Japanese militarism. This is absolutely impossible! Her second daughter, Huang Runxia, whom she only found after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, was very angry today. She constantly raised her fist and shouted: "Oppose the US-Japan military alliance treaty!" "Down with US imperialism!"
    Mo Naiqun, vice chairman of the Guangxi Branch of the Chinese Committee for the Defense of World Peace, and the heads of the autonomous region's trade union, Communist Youth League, and women's federation also spoke at the meeting, all expressing their firm support for the Japanese people's struggle against US imperialism and the Kishi Nobusuke reactionary group.
    The meeting passed a telegram of support to the Japanese people amid warm applause.

    据新华社杭州12日电　曾经在日寇铁蹄下遭受过深重灾难的浙江省杭州市人民，今天完全被美日反动派策划新战争的阴谋激怒了。各界人民十六万人今天下午分区举行声势浩大的集会和示威游行，坚决支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的正义斗争。
    西湖畔的湖滨路和南山路，到处是密密的人群，“反对日美军事同盟条约！”“反对复活日本军国主义！”“美帝国主义从日本滚出去！”“打倒美帝国主义！”的口号声，不停地响彻在西湖一带。在上千名全副武装、雄赳赳气昂昂的民兵队伍里，走在最前面的是出席全国民兵代表大会的代表、杭州市上城区粮食门市部民兵连指导员郑培元。他的父亲被日寇用刺刀刺伤，母亲遭强奸，房子被烧，旧仇新恨交炽在一起，他紧握枪杆，愤怒地警告说，如果美日反动派再胆敢侵犯中国，全民武装了的中国人民就坚决把它消灭得干干净净。杭州第九中学女子民兵连连长黄水淼，也是出席全国民兵大会的代表，她的两个姐姐在日寇侵入时逃难死亡。今天，她率领着全连女子民兵，走在游行队伍的前列，高声怒吼：“打倒美帝国主义！”杭州西北角的拱墅区，曾被日寇放火十多次、烧毁民房近千间，死难的人很多。今天，这里的工人、学生和拱墅公社的社员们参加了示威游行，他们愤怒地控诉当年日寇的滔天罪行，表示坚决反对美日反动派策划新战争的阴谋。父亲被打重伤致死的杭州丝绸联合厂女工杨昭娣，在控诉了杀父之仇以后，表示坚决要用实际行动支援日本人民的正义斗争。
