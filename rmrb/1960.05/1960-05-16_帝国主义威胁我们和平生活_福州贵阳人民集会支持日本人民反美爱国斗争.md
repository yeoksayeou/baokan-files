Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, May 15th: One hundred and fifty thousand people from all walks of life in Fujian Province and Fuzhou City, on the front line of national defense, held massive rallies and demonstrations in different districts on the afternoon of the 14th, resolutely supporting the Japanese people's just struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty.

　　The people of Fuzhou City, who had suffered from the aggression of Japanese imperialism and the bombing by U.S.-made Chiang planes, wore slogan belts and held high cartoon slogan flags. The militiamen, fully armed, held demonstrations with high spirits. At 2:00 PM, a mass rally attended by more than 40,000 people was held at the Fuzhou City Stadium. Lin Yixin, Secretary of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and He Minxue, Deputy Governor, attended the rally. Xu Yuqing, a member of the Standing Committee of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke at the rally, saying: Under the support of U.S. imperialism, Japanese militarism is being revived, which not only seriously threatens the security of China, the Soviet Union, and Asian countries, but will also once again drag the Japanese nation into the abyss of war. This is absolutely intolerable to the Japanese people and the Asian people. Heads of democratic parties and people's organizations in Fujian Province, as well as representatives of workers and farmers, also spoke at the meeting. Taiwan compatriots and returned overseas Japanese who had lived under the long-term rule and enslavement of Japanese imperialism were even more furious at the war conspiracy of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries and resolutely supported the just struggle of the Japanese people.

　　The rally also issued a telegram from people of all walks of life in Fujian Province and Fuzhou City supporting the just struggle of the Japanese people and opposing the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, May 15th: One hundred thousand people from all ethnic groups in Guiyang City held a massive demonstration and rally on the afternoon of the 14th, resolutely supporting the Japanese people's struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty.

　　The people of Guiyang, who suffered cruel bombings by Japanese militarism during the War of Resistance Against Japan, cannot forget the tragic scene of rubble-strewn streets and the cries of children and mothers. Today, when they heard that the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries were colluding to try to replay the war of fifteen years ago in Asia, people were extremely angry. From noon, countless streams of enraged people, holding huge slogans such as "Oppose the Japan-U.S. Military Alliance Treaty" and "U.S. Imperialism Get Out of Japan," surged towards the venue. More than an hour before the meeting, the entire square and the wide Beijing Road outside the venue were filled with demonstrators, many of whom had suffered cruel persecution by Japanese fascists during the Japanese invasion of China or had bravely fought against the Japanese invading army and dealt heavy blows to the Japanese invaders.

　　Wang Xiaochuan, a member of the Standing Committee of the Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke at the rally on behalf of the Provincial Party Committee. He said that the serious damage caused by the Japanese invaders' bombing of Guiyang during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the disaster brought to the people by the "Southern Guizhou Incident" are unforgettable for all the people of Guizhou. We will never allow the revival of Japanese militarism.

　　Representatives of various organizations, as well as representatives of workers, farmers, citizens, and students, also spoke at the meeting, all expressing their resolute support for the Japanese people's just struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty.

　　The rally finally adopted a telegram supporting the Japanese people's struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. After the meeting, 100,000 people marched in three routes.

    中共贵州省委常委汪小川代表省委在大会上讲话。他说，抗日战争时期，日本侵略者用飞机轰炸贵阳所造成的严重损失，“黔南事变”给人民带来的灾难，是贵州全体人民永远不能忘记的。我们决不容许日本军国主义的复活。
