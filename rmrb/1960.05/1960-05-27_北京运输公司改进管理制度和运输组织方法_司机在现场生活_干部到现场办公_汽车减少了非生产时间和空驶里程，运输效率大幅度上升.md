Beijing Transportation Company Improves Management System and Transportation Organization Methods
Drivers Live On-Site, Cadres Work On-Site
Automobiles Reduce Non-Production Time and Empty Mileage, Transportation Efficiency Increases Significantly

(Our report) Beijing Transportation Company employees recently created a set of "Ten Moves" management system and transportation organization method, greatly changing the phenomenon of cars "running in the middle, stuck at both ends," causing the average daily transportation volume to surge from 120,000 tons to 150,000 tons.

Prior to April, many of the company's depots, regardless of the distance of the cargo location or the amount of cargo loaded and unloaded, would dispatch vehicles to the cargo location in the early morning, return to the depot for lunch at noon, and return to the depot to hand over shifts in the evening. This resulted in phenomena such as queuing to leave the depot for inspection, queuing to return to the depot for refueling, queuing in the cafeteria for meals, not being able to find the dispatcher for a road permit before leaving, and empty runs due to improper dispatching, wasting about a quarter of the daily production time. Based on this situation, the company's Party committee decided to launch a revolution in production organization. Soon, the Magongzhuang Motor Vehicle Depot, responsible for transportation tasks in the eastern suburbs, created a set of "Ten Moves" transportation organization method.

The specific content of the "Ten Moves" is: (1) Automobile "Move": Automobiles are parked on-site and do not return to the depot unless necessary; drivers' dormitories are also moved to the site; (2) Refueling "Move": Fuel is delivered to various transportation points on a regular basis, and cars do not return to the depot for refueling; (3) Shift handover "Move": Drivers hand over shifts at the loading site or designated location; (4) Dispatching "Move": Some dispatching personnel and authority are delegated to specialized transportation teams to better organize rational transportation; (5) Leading Cadres' Office "Move": Some follow the vehicles to participate in labor, and some work at the point; (6) Vehicle Maintenance "Move": Maintenance workers take turns going to the site to carry out vehicle maintenance and repair work; (7) Vehicle Inspection "Move": Each specialized transportation point has dedicated personnel to check the vehicle parts before leaving the depot to ensure safe driving; (8) Statistics "Move": Some statistical personnel go to the site to help workers calculate; (9) Eating "Move": Temporary canteens are opened on-site or meals are delivered to the site; (10) Cultural Learning and Recreational Activities "Move": Activities are carried out on-site using workers' rest time. When promoting this new transportation organization method, Beijing transportation departments adopted two forms: transportation points far from the depot with concentrated cargo sources fully implemented the "Ten Moves"; some transportation points close to the depot with dispersed cargo sources implemented shift handover "Move," eating "Move," etc., according to specific circumstances.

The implementation of the "Ten Moves" transportation organization method has four major benefits: First, it increases vehicle running time and reduces auxiliary time. According to statistics, in the past, each car spent two and a half to three hours each day on refueling, vehicle inspection, and other aspects. Now, it only takes half an hour. Second, due to the reduction of empty mileage and the vigorous promotion of fuel-saving campaigns, the entire company has saved more than 500,000 liters of gasoline and diesel in just over a month. Third, the convergence of staff from all aspects on-site has greatly improved the relationship between leaders and the masses, between drivers and maintenance personnel, and between functional departments and production departments. Fourth, it strengthens the relationship between transportation and shipping departments and promotes the "one-stop" movement of production, supply, sales, and transportation.

    北京运输公司改进管理制度和运输组织方法
    司机在现场生活　干部到现场办公
    汽车减少了非生产时间和空驶里程，运输效率大幅度上升
    本报讯　北京市运输公司职工最近创造了一套“十搬家”的管理制度和运输组织方法，大大改变了汽车“跑在中间，窝在两头”的现象，使平均日运量从十二万吨猛增到十五万吨。
    4月以前，这个公司的许多车场不管货运地点远近、装卸货物多少，都是清晨出车到货运地点，中午回车场吃饭，晚上回场交班。这样，就产生了出场排队等检验、回场排队等加油、食堂排队等吃饭、临走找不到调度员等路签、调度不当跑空车等现象，使每天四分之一左右的生产时间浪费掉了。根据这个情况，公司党委决定在生产组织方面来一次革命，在东郊担负运输任务的马公庄汽车场不久就创造了一套“十搬家”的运输组织方法。
    “十搬家”的具体内容是：（一）汽车“搬家”：汽车在现场停放，非必要时不回车场，司机宿舍也搬到现场；（二）加油“搬家”：定期往各运输点送油，汽车不回车场加油；（三）交接班“搬家”：司机在装货现场或指定的地点交接班；（四）调度“搬家”：把部分调度人员和权限下放到专业运输小队，以便更好地组织合理运输；
  （五）领导干部办公“搬家”：有的跟车参加劳动，有的住点办公；
  （六）保修车辆“搬家”：保修工人轮流下现场进行车辆保养和修理工作；（七）车辆检查“搬家”：各专业运输点都设有专人检查出场车辆的机件，确保安全行车；（八）统计“搬家”：部分统计人员下到现场，帮助工人算账；（九）吃饭“搬家”：在现场开设临时食堂或送饭到现场；（十）文化学习和文娱活动“搬家”：利用工人休息时间，在现场开展活动。北京运输部门在推广这种新的运输组织方法时，采取了两种形式：离车场较远、货源集中的运输点，全部实行“十搬家”；一些离车场较近、货源分散的运输点，根据具体情况，实行交接班“搬家”、吃饭“搬家”等。
    推行“十搬家”运输组织方法，有四大好处：一、增加了汽车运行时间，减少了辅助时间。据统计，以往每辆汽车每天花在加油、车辆检验等方面的时间，需要二个半到三个小时。现在，只需半小时就行了。二、由于减少了空驶里程和大搞节油运动，一个多月来，全公司总共节省汽油、柴油五十多万公升。三、各方面工作人员在现场会师，大大改善了领导和群众之间、司机和保养人员之间、职能部门和生产部门之间的关系。四、密切了运输和托运部门之间的关系，促进了产、供、销、运输“一条龙”运动。
