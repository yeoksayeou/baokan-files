Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 12th: Since the establishment of urban people's communes in Xi'an, more than 200,000 women have stepped out of their homes to participate in various forms of social labor. This figure accounts for about 80% of the total number of women in the city capable of working.

The urban people's communes in Xi'an have established more than 8,800 production units and collective welfare and social service organizations. Among them, more than 2,700 are production organizations, with housewives accounting for 73% of the employees. In the collective living welfare undertakings centered on public canteens, housewives account for more than 80%. Almost all of the staff in the city's more than 1,000 nurseries and kindergartens are housewives.

After participating in collective production and various social tasks, the broad masses of housewives have demonstrated soaring enthusiasm and boundless wisdom. For example, Li Xiuying and Liu Suzhen, housewives from Xi'er Road in the Xincheng District, started a small hardware fuse factory with a pair of scissors, a hammer, and a small iron anvil. They started with only four people, processing spectacle cases with scissors and hammers, with a total capital of only 150 yuan. Later, they gradually developed into processing copper wire and manufacturing fuses. Now, the factory has a total of 101 workers, and the output value for the first four months of this year reached 420,000 yuan. In the past year or so, they have produced more than 55,000 spools of fuses alone, supporting urban construction. From January this year, the factory also began producing blowers.

After participating in production, housewives have generally improved their technical, political, and cultural levels. Party organizations in various streets have held various technical training classes for housewives, and women have also organized many technical research groups, teaching and learning from each other. Now, some housewives are able to produce relatively complex products, including stylish and colorful plastic handbags, knitted curtains, high-end embroidery, and glass instruments. Some of the carpets exported from Xi'an last year were made by housewives. The vast majority of the more than 200,000 housewives who participate in production and work have shed their illiteracy, and many women have advanced to junior high school or higher levels of education. For example, among the more than 5,000 women who have become literate in the Zhongshanmen area, more than 2,000 have reached the level of junior high school and higher primary school. Many women have been promoted to leadership positions due to their increased awareness and working ability in collective labor. Several hundred women throughout the city serve as factory directors, deputy factory directors, or other important positions in commune-run factories.

In order to enable these housewives to break away from household chores and participate in collective production and work, the urban people's communes in Xi'an have established a large number of collective welfare undertakings. The people's communes have established 1,721 public canteens, serving more than 300,000 people; 1,716 nurseries and kindergartens, caring for nearly 100,000 children; and more than 2,700 various life service stations, with more than 20,000 service personnel, forming a residential life service network throughout the city, which is greatly welcomed by residents.

    城市公社给家庭妇女开辟了广阔天地
    西安二十万妇女参加社会劳动
    新华社西安12日电　西安市在建立城市人民公社以后，已经有二十多万妇女走出家庭，参加了各种社会劳动。这个数字占全市能够参加劳动的妇女总数的80％左右。
    西安市各城市人民公社举办的生产单位以及集体福利事业和社会服务组织共有八千八百多个，其中生产组织有二千七百多个，从业人员中家庭妇女占73％，以公共食堂为中心的集体生活福利事业中，家庭妇女占80％以上。全市一千多个托儿所、幼儿园组织的工作人员，几乎全部是家庭妇女。
    广大家庭妇女参加集体生产和各种社会工作以后，发挥了冲天干劲和无尽的智慧。如新城区西二路家庭妇女李秀英，刘素珍等，以一把裁刀、一个铁锤和小铁枕起家，办起了一个小五金保险丝工厂。她们开始只有四个人，用裁刀和铁锤加工眼镜盒，全部资金只有一百五十元，后来逐渐发展到加工铜丝和制造保险丝，现在这个工厂共有工人一百零一人，今年头四个月产值就达到四十二万元。一年多来，仅保险丝就生产了五万五千多盘，支援了城市建设。从今年1月起，这个工厂又开始生产鼓风机。
    家庭妇女们参加生产以后，技术水平和政治、文化水平已经普遍有了提高。各个街道党组织为家庭妇女们举办了各种技术训练班，妇女们也组织了许多技术研究小组，互教互学。现在，有些家庭妇女已经能够制作技术比较复杂的产品，包括式样美观、色泽鲜艳的塑料提包、针织窗帘、高级刺绣、玻璃仪器等。西安去年出口的一些地毯，就是由家庭妇女制造的。参加生产和工作的二十多万家庭妇女，绝大部分都摆脱了文盲状态，许多妇女已经进修到初中或高小以上文化水平。如中山门地区五千多名脱盲妇女中，有二千多名妇女已达到初中和高小程度。许多妇女由于在集体劳动中提高了觉悟和工作能力，已经被提拔担任领导工作，全市有数百名妇女担任着社办工厂的厂长、副厂长或其它重要职务。
    为了使这些家庭妇女能够摆脱家务牵累参加集体生产和工作，西安市的各城市人民公社举办了大量集体福利事业。各人民公社举办的公共食堂就有一千七百二十一个，就餐人数有三十多万人；托儿所、幼儿园一千七百一十六个，收托儿童近十万名；各种生活服务站二千七百多个，有两万多名服务人员，在全市形成了一个居民生活服务网，受到居民的极大欢迎。
