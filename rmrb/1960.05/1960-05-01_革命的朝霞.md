    Revolutionary Dawn
    Liu Baiyu
    The working people created their own festival through struggle. All those who fight for freedom and liberation are constantly enriching this festival with struggle, making it forever youthful and vibrant.
    Currently, the struggle against imperialism is surging and developing. The revolutionary struggle launched by the people of South Korea against American imperialism and the dictatorial rule of Syngman Rhee is extremely heroic and deeply moving. It is truly a storm, a violently surging ocean, writing a magnificent page in the history of people's revolutionary struggles.
    Look! What heroic, what lovable people! They do not stop when bullets hit their chests. They do not stop when blood flows on the ground. Sons disarm tanks with their bare hands, mothers jump on them and shout, "To Gyeongmudae!" What an inspiring cry! This cry will resonate around the earth forever! It will penetrate deeply into people's hearts and resonate forever. Now, it is no surprise that all workers, progressives, the oppressed, and people with a sense of justice around the world are paying their respects to the Korean people. Because the signal was sent by you. The signal of revolutionary struggle against brutal oppression once again shoots straight into the sky, illuminating the eyes of the people.
    This event occurred in the first spring of the 1960s. Is it merely a coincidental coincidence? No, it symbolizes the beginning of the end for American imperialism. People are inspired by the heroic actions of the South Korean people and feel that this great "spirit of rebellion" is the most sublime and magnificent. People will be eager to emulate these pioneers, find weapons around them, and hurl them at the oppressors in front of them. Therefore, this struggle is the first wave of the rising tide, and it will tremble and spread like sound waves in a chain reaction.
    The outstanding actions of the South Korean people remind us of Marx's praise for the Paris insurgents, expressed with all the passion of a proletarian fighter. He said:
    "What flexibility, what historical initiative, what a capacity for sacrifice these Parisians possess!… There is no parallel in history for such heroism!"
    This noble heroism has now once again appeared in South Korea, the forefront of American imperialist aggression, their powder keg, their underground fortress, here, fully armed, heavily guarded, here, where the ground is covered with bayonet tips, here, where the air is filled with the smell of explosives. But, not elsewhere, precisely in this place. This noble heroism has suddenly appeared like a red sun.
    Do you see this as a miraculous wonder? Syngman Rhee, the most stubborn, most die-hard, jackal fostered by the United States, the most frantically anti-people dictator's little court. Yesterday, it was still like an impregnable wall of bronze, but today, under a revolutionary storm, it has been swept away, collapsing and falling apart. What a majestic, what a great revolutionary spirit, revolutionary perseverance! It shows a truth: no matter what bullets, tear gas, water cannons, fire engines, tanks, missiles, plus "Eisenhower's visit" can do, the people's hands can strip them clean in an instant, sweeping them away like fallen leaves. And once the lid is lifted, the masses' resistance struggle will resonate like rivers and seas, with ten thousand horses galloping, unstoppable. The people, yes, the people. Everything proves that no matter how solid the old world's fortress is, it will ultimately be shattered by the people's own hands.
    The South Korean people's blood has not yet dried. The bright red thousands and tens of thousands of drops not only remain on the streets but also remain in people's hearts. They are sparks, they will surely shine. They will most eloquently call upon people to advance, and advance again; history advances, and advances again.
    Syngman Rhee has "resigned" under the impact of the heroic revolutionary storm, and is even "missing." However, people know very well where the bullets that shot the South Korean youth in the chest, the bullets that took the lives of the South Korean youth, the bullets that caused mothers to lose their own children came from. They are American bullets. American bullets directly hit the hearts of the Korean people, hurting the hearts of the Korean people. Faced with this fact, will people be deceived by the United States because Syngman Rhee is "missing"? The American imperialists are now playing this trick: sacrificing a Syngman Rhee to maintain American rule. The cunning man-eating beasts of Wall Street want to stir up trouble, divert the target, in order to keep the "situation" under their control. However, historical experience has long taught the people that at this juncture, reactionary ruling forces always adopt despicable methods of deception and intimidation simultaneously.
    The South Korean people's struggle against American imperialism is not an isolated event, but only the beginning of things. Now, the Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan military treaty is in full swing. And in Latin America, the flames of resistance to aggression are burning fiercely. No matter how imperialism suppresses and deceives, the crimes they have committed have been deeply imprinted in people's hearts and cannot be erased. Because the era of American bullets arbitrarily slaughtering people has been very long, but now that era is gone forever. The event that shook the first spring of the 1960s shows that this is the era of ringing the revolutionary dawn and tolling the death knell of imperialism. I would like to quote a sentence said by Engels, he said: "The flames that burned in the Tuileries Palace and the Royal Palace are the dawn of the proletariat." And today, are not the flames that burned in the Seoul "National Assembly" hall and Gyeongmudae the revolutionary dawn of crushing American imperialist aggression, surging and surging on a worldwide scale? Yes, it is the dawn, it is the beginning of a new day. Now, Syngman Rhee's statue has been smashed to the ground. Was this possible yesterday? Syngman Rhee's puppet police are fearfully taking off their black uniforms. Was this possible yesterday? But the revolution must develop towards tomorrow. The American army is still entrenched on Korean soil, pressing down on the heads of people in many countries around the world. Blood shines a light on the road ahead for people all over the world. This is a revolutionary road leading to the people's own liberation. At this time, the people who lit the dawn must make persistent efforts; the people who have seen the dawn will surely advance bravely. The ideal of the working people and all oppressed people creating a free and happy life will surely be realized throughout the earth!

    革命的朝霞
    刘白羽
    劳动人民从斗争中创造了自己的节日。一切争自由，争解放的人们，不断地以斗争丰富着这个节日。使这节日永远具有青春的活力。
    目前，反对帝国主义的斗争，正在汹涌澎湃发展着。南朝鲜人民所发动的反对美帝国主义、反对李承晚独裁统治的革命斗争，实在是英勇极了，动人极了。这简直是风暴，是猛烈冲激的海洋，它为人民革命斗争历史写下了非常壮丽的一页。
    看！这是何等英雄，何等可爱的人们，枪弹射在胸膛上，他们不停止。鲜血淌在地面上，他们不停止。儿子们用双手缴获了坦克，母亲们跳上去高呼：“到景武台去！”这是何等激动人心的喊声！这喊声将环绕着地球永久地震响下去！它将深入人心永久地震响下去。现在，一点也不奇怪，全世界所有的劳动者，进步分子，被压迫者，以及有正义感的人们，都在对朝鲜人民肃然致敬。因为信号是由你们发射的。反抗残暴压迫的革命斗争的信号，又一次直冲高空，照亮了人们的眼睛。
    这事件发生在六十年代的第一个春天，难道是偶然的巧合吗？不，它象征着美帝国主义的末日的开端。人们都为南朝鲜人民的英雄行为所鼓舞，都感到这种伟大的“叛逆精神”是最崇高、最壮丽的。人们将摩拳擦掌，效法这些先驱者，在自己身旁寻找武器，向面前的压迫者掷去。因此，这斗争是涨潮时的第一个浪花，它将像音波一样，连锁式地震颤开去。
    南朝鲜人民出色的行为，使人想起当年马克思用无产阶级战士全部热情对巴黎起义者的赞语，他说：
    “这些巴黎人是多么灵活、多么富于历史的主动性和多么勇于自我牺牲呵！……历史上从未有过这种英雄主义！”
    这种崇高的英雄主义，现在，又一次，在南朝鲜，这美帝国主义侵略阵地的最前哨，他们的火药库，他们的地下堡，在这儿，全副武装，戒备森严，在这儿，遍地密布着刺刀尖，在这儿，空气都含着炸药气。但，不是在旁处，正是在这地方。这种崇高的英雄主义像一轮红日矗然出现了。
    你看这不是神妙的奇迹吗？李承晚，这个最顽固，最死硬，由美国豢养出来的豺狼，最疯狂地反人民的独裁者的小朝廷。昨天还俨然是铜墙铁壁，而今天，在一阵革命的巨风之下，扫得已经土崩瓦解，一片狼籍了。这是多么雄壮，多么伟大的革命精神，革命毅力呀！这里显示了一个真理：任凭子弹、催泪弹、水龙、救火车、坦克、导弹，加上“艾森豪威尔的访问”，都可以给人民的双手在顷刻之间剥夺得干干净净，打扫得落花流水。而且盖子一经揭开，群众的反抗斗争，就将江海齐鸣、万马奔腾，不可遏止。人民，是的，人民。一切证明，不论多么坚固的旧世界堡垒，也总归会被人民亲手所粉碎。
    南朝鲜人民的鲜血未干。鲜红的千滴万点，不但留在街头上，而且留在人们的心里。它们是火花，它们必闪亮。它们将最雄辩地呼唤人们前进，再前进；历史前进，再前进。
    李承晚在英雄的革命风暴冲激之下“辞职”了，而且“下落不明”了。可是，人们清清楚楚地知道：射击在南朝鲜青年胸膛上的子弹，夺去南朝鲜青年生命的子弹，使得母亲失去亲生儿女的子弹，是从哪儿来的。这是美国子弹。是美国子弹，直接地击中了朝鲜人民的心，击痛了朝鲜人民的心。面对这一事实，难道人们会由于李承晚“下落不明”就会受美国的欺骗吗？而现在美帝国主义者正在玩弄这种欺骗：牺牲一个李承晚，来维护美国统治。华尔街狡猾的吃人的野兽，想要煽风点火，转移目标，以便把“形势”控制在他们掌握之中。但是，历史的经验早已教育了人民，在这种关头上，反动统治势力，总是采取欺骗与威慑同时并用的卑劣手法的。
    南朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义的斗争，不是一件孤立的事，而且只是事情的开始。现在，日本人民反对日美军事条约的斗争，正在势如怒潮。而在拉丁美洲，反抗侵略的火焰已在熊熊燃烧。不管帝国主义怎样一面镇压，一面欺诈，而他们自己造下的罪，已经深印人心，不可摩拭得掉了。因为美国子弹任意屠杀人民的年代已经很长久了，而现在那一个时代却已一去不复返了。震动了六十年代第一个春天的事件，说明这是敲起革命的晨钟，而响起帝国主义丧钟的年代。我想引用恩格斯所说过的一句话，他说：“在土伊勒里宫和皇家之宫燃起的火焰，是无产阶级的朝霞。”而今天，在汉城“国会”议事堂和景武台燃起的火焰，不正是在全世界范围内，风起云涌地粉碎美帝国主义侵略的革命的朝霞吗？不错，是朝霞，它是新的一天的开始。现在，李承晚的铜像已砸倒在地下，昨天这是可能的吗？李伪警察正恐惧地脱下了黑色制服，昨天这是可能的吗？但是革命必需向明天发展，美国军队还盘踞在朝鲜国土之上，压在全世界许多国家的人民的头上。血光照亮了全世界人民面前的道路。这是一条通向人民自己解放自己的革命道路。在这种时候，点燃了朝霞的人们，必需再接再厉；望见了朝霞的人们，必将奋勇前进。劳动人民及一切被压迫人民创造自由幸福生活的理想，一定会在整个地球上实现！
