    The Path of Struggle for the People of Gunma Prefecture
    By Jiaotian Yihe Numao, Chairman of the "Gunma Prefecture Association to Defend Democracy"
    Gunma Prefecture is located about one hundred kilometers north of Tokyo, with a population of about 1.6 million. For several years, the people of Gunma Prefecture have been waging a vigorous struggle against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," for Japan-China friendship, and for the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China. Several years ago, when the U.S. military wanted to build a base for mountain troops on Mount Myogi, the people of the entire prefecture launched a struggle against the U.S. military base. In the course of the struggle, the Japanese Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and other democratic groups formed a joint struggle organization. This struggle against the U.S. military base ended victoriously in January 1955, five years ago. In 1957, a poor peasant housewife named Sakai Naka in Gunma Prefecture, because of difficult living conditions, went to the U.S. military base training ground in Sōmagahara to pick up shell casings. As a result, she was shot and killed by an American soldier named Jerad as if it were a game. This incident ignited the people's anger. The struggle of the people of Gunma Prefecture to protest this incident, combined with the struggle against U.S. military bases within the prefecture, launched a high tide of anti-American struggle.
    In 1958, the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries, in order to prepare for a new war and revive militarist education, attempted to forcibly implement the so-called "performance evaluation system" for teachers. The 12,000 teachers and staff in elementary and middle schools in Gunma Prefecture are very progressive. They resolutely opposed the "performance evaluation system." They repeatedly took resistance measures, mainly in the form of "collective leave." Under the suppression of the reactionary authorities, more than 30 people were arrested, of whom 10 were prosecuted. In addition, more than 3,000 people were subjected to administrative sanctions such as suspension and salary reduction. Nevertheless, they persisted in their struggle unremittingly. While opposing the "performance evaluation system," the people of Gunma Prefecture also actively participated in the struggle against the Kishi Nobusuke government's revision of the "Police Duties Law." In this struggle, Gunma Prefecture produced a joint struggle organization against the "performance evaluation system" and against the revision of the "Police Duties Law," which further strengthened the democratic united front.
    Since the Kishi Nobusuke government plotted the conspiracy to revise the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" in the autumn of 1958, the struggle of the people of Gunma Prefecture against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" has been increasingly strengthened. Because it was anticipated that this struggle would be a long-term and arduous struggle to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and strive for Japan's complete independence and neutrality, we urgently felt the need to develop the joint struggle organization into a broad and lasting organization including all the people of the prefecture. On the premise of confirming the leading role of the Japanese Communist Party and the Socialist Party, the "Gunma Prefecture Association to Defend Democracy" was formed in November 1958. This organization adopts two ways of joining: through organizations and as individuals, striving to widely organize the people. Now, this organization already has nearly 200 grassroots organizations within the prefecture, and its development speed can be said to be one unit developed per day.
    On the basis of the rapid development of the joint struggle organization, the struggle of the people of Gunma Prefecture against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" continues to advance. The people of Gunma Prefecture not only actively participated in more than a dozen unified actions in 1959, but the struggle developed even further in 1960. From January 19, when Kishi Nobusuke signed the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty in Washington, to the present, the people of Gunma Prefecture, together with the people of the whole country, have been conducting a huge struggle against the National Diet's approval of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty in various ways such as collecting signatures, petitions, rallies, and demonstrations.

    群马县人民斗争的道路
    “群马县拥护民主县民会议”议长  角田仪平沼
    群马县位处东京以北大约一百公里，人口一百六十万左右。几年来，群马县人民一直为反对日美“安全条约”、争取日中友好和恢复日中邦交而进行了强有力的斗争。几年前，当美军要在妙义山建立山地部队的基地时，全县人民掀起了反对美军基地的斗争。在斗争过程中日本共产党、社会党及其他民主团体组成了共同斗争组织。这一反对美军基地的斗争在五年前的1955年1月以胜利告终。1957年群马县有一位叫坂井中的贫农家庭主妇，因为生活困难到相马原的美军基地演习场去拾弹壳，结果被一个叫哲腊德的美国大兵像儿戏一样开枪打死了。这个事件燃起了人民的怒火。群马县人民抗议这一事件的斗争同县内反对美军基地的斗争结合起来，掀起了反美斗争的高潮。
    1958年美日反动派为了准备新战争和复活军国主义教育而企图强迫实行所谓教职员的“勤务评定制度”。群马县的中小学校一万二千名教职员都是非常进步的。他们坚决反对“勤务评定制度”。他们一再采取以“全体请假”方式为主的斗争，进行了反抗。在反动当局的镇压下，有三十多人被捕，其中有十人被起诉。此外，受停职、减薪等行政处分的达三千多人。尽管如此，他们仍坚持不懈地进行斗争。在反对“勤务评定制度”的同时，群马县人民还积极投入了反对岸信介政府修改“警职法”的斗争。在这次斗争中，群马县产生了反对“勤务评定制度”和反对修改“警职法”的共同斗争组织，进一步加强了民主统一战线。
    自从1958年秋天岸信介政府策划修改日美“安全条约”阴谋以来，群马县人民反对日美“安全条约”的斗争就日益加强起来。因为预计到这一斗争是为了打倒岸信介内阁和争取日本完全独立与中立的长期艰巨斗争，所以我们迫切地感到有必要把共同斗争组织发展为包括全县人民在内的广泛而持久的组织。在确认日本共产党、社会党起领导作用的前提下，于1958年11月组成了“群马县拥护民主县民联合会”。这个组织采取团体和个人入会的两种方式，力求广泛地把人民组织起来。现在，这个组织在县内已经拥有近二百个基层组织，其发展速度之快，可以说是一天发展一个单位。
    在共同斗争组织迅速发展的基础上，群马县人民反对日美“安全条约”的斗争不断地前进。群马县人民不仅在1959年积极参加了十几次的统一行动，到了1960年斗争更加发展了。从1月19日岸信介在华盛顿签署日美军事同盟条约起到现在，群马县人民和全国人民一道以征集签名、请愿、集会和示威游行等各种方式为反对国会批准日美军事同盟条约而进行巨大的斗争。
