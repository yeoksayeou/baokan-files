    Large Stone Arch Bridge Erected on the Upper Reaches of the Yellow River
    The 50-meter Span Longwu Yellow River Bridge in Qinghai Province Opens to Traffic
    (This newspaper report) The Longwu Yellow River Bridge, built on the upper reaches of the Yellow River in the Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Qinghai Province, officially opened to traffic on May Day.
    This is a 50-meter large-span spandrel arch bridge, located in the middle section of the Qinghai Province Ping (Ping'an Yi) - He (Henan Mongol Autonomous County) highway. Its construction time took only five months, shortening the original plan by seven months. The bridge is 83.45 meters long, 14.7 meters high, and the bridge deck is 7 meters wide, allowing two large trucks to pass side by side. The completion of this bridge will not only promote the political, economic, and cultural development of the Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, but also enable a steady stream of timber, fur, and other products from the Huangnan area to be transported out, supporting the socialist construction of the entire province and the country.
    The bridge was mostly constructed using local stone materials, using only five tons of steel and more than 300 tons of cement. Compared with bridges of the same size built purely with steel and cement, it saved 150 tons of steel and 500 tons of cement, reducing the cost by more than 40%.
    The spandrel arch bridge is an excellent traditional architectural art in our country. It has many advantages, such as obtaining materials locally, saving steel and cement, having a large load capacity, being durable, and being majestic and magnificent. The world's first stone arch bridge of this type is the Anji Bridge in Zhao County, Hebei Province, built more than 1,350 years ago. Before the construction of the Longwu Yellow River Bridge, the Highway Bureau of the Qinghai Provincial Department of Transportation organized a group of engineering and technical personnel to visit the 60-meter large-span stone arch bridge in Huanghu Port, Hunan Province, and the large-span rubble arch bridge in Dean, Jiangxi Province, to educate them to overcome the incorrect idea of looking down on stone arch bridges, and also to enable them to learn bridge-building art. During the construction process, the bridge-building workers encountered many difficulties. The bridge construction required 3,200 cubic meters of stone, which was planned to be quarried by 300 stonemasons, but during material preparation, there were only three stonemasons. The large cranes and other mechanical equipment needed for bridge construction were also lacking. More difficult was that the more than 600 workers responsible for the bridge construction were building such a large-span stone arch bridge for the first time and lacked construction experience. Under the leadership of the Party, they put forward the heroic slogan of "If we don't have technicians, we will train them ourselves; if we don't have equipment, we will make it ourselves; if we don't have technology, we will study it ourselves; if we don't have materials, we will find them ourselves," working hard and cleverly to overcome all difficulties. In the short few months of bridge construction, they trained a total of 112 stonemasons, 15 carpenters, and 6 ironworkers, strengthening the technical force; and created 126 construction tools, which doubled the construction efficiency, thus accelerating the construction speed.

### 黄河上游架起大石拱桥  青海省五十米大跨径的隆务黄河大桥通车

    黄河上游架起大石拱桥
    青海省五十米大跨径的隆务黄河大桥通车
    本报讯  建设在青海省黄南藏族自治州境内黄河上游的隆务黄河大桥，已在“五一”节正式通车。
    这是一座五十米大跨径的空腹式石拱桥，位于青海省平（平安驿）河（河南蒙族自治县）公路的中段。它的建设时间只用了五个月，比原计划缩短了七个月。桥长八十三点四五米，高十四点七米，桥面宽七米，可以并排通行两辆大卡车。这座桥梁建成以后，不仅对黄南藏族自治州的政治、经济、文化的发展具有促进作用，而且可使黄南地区的木材、皮毛等物产源源运出，支援全省和全国的社会主义建设。
    这座桥梁大部分是用当地的石料建设的，只用了五吨钢材，三百多吨水泥；与纯用钢材、水泥建设的同样大小的桥梁比较，节约钢材一百五十吨，水泥五百吨，造价低40％以上。
    空腹式石拱桥是我国优秀的传统建筑艺术，它具有就地取财，节约钢筋、水泥，负荷量大，经久耐用，雄巍壮观等许多优点。世界上第一座这种形式的石拱桥是河北省赵县安济桥，建桥时间距今已有一千三百五十多年。在隆务黄河大桥修建之前，青海省交通厅公路局曾经组织一批工程技术人员，参观了湖南省黄虎港六十米大跨径石拱桥和江西省德安大跨径乱石拱桥，教育他们克服看不起石拱桥的不正确思想，同时也使他们学习了建桥艺术。在施工过程中，建桥职工碰到了重重困难。修桥需要三千二百立方米石料，按计划需要三百名石工开凿，但在备料的时候，只有三名石工；修桥需要的大型起重机等机械设备也没有。更困难的是，担任修桥任务的六百余名职工，都是第一次修筑这样大跨径的石拱桥，缺乏施工经验。他们在党的领导下，提出了“没有技工自己训，没有设备自己造，没有技术自己钻，没有材料自己找”的豪迈口号，苦干巧干，克服了所有的困难。在建桥的短短几个月里，他们共培养出石工一百一十二名，木工十五名，铁工六名，壮大了技术力量；创制出一百二十六件施工机具，使施工效率成倍地提高，因此加快了建设速度。
