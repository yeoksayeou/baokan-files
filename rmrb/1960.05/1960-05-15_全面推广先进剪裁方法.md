Fully Promote Advanced Tailoring Methods
*People's Daily* Commentator

The advanced tailoring method of tight nesting and rational use of cloth is a great creation of China's clothing industry in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. In the clothing industry, for many years, there has been a saying that "seven feet of cloth for trousers, eight feet for a jacket." This means that to make a set of clothes for a person of medium build, fifteen feet of cloth is essential. Some people are constrained by this saying, believing that it is impossible to save cloth by reforming tailoring methods, or at least that the "fat" is gone. Now, this saying has been broken by the advanced tailoring method of tight nesting and rational use of cloth. This method can be applied to tailoring all kinds of clothes. No matter what kind of clothes are tailored, it can meet the requirements of practicality and aesthetics in terms of size and quality, and also save materials. More than 100 sewing cooperative stores, four industrial clothing factories, and 22 service industry clothing factories in Beijing have widely adopted this tailoring method, and each set of clothing, with the same length and width, can use one to two feet less cloth. "Seven feet of cloth for trousers, eight feet for a jacket" has become "six feet of cloth for trousers, seven feet for a jacket." Saving one or two feet per set of clothes is a very significant matter. As the ancient saying goes, "Many a little makes a mickle." China has 650 million people, and if each person saves a little each year, the total will be an extremely considerable amount. Facts have proved that saving cloth by reforming tailoring methods is not only possible but also has great potential.

Over the past ten years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the output of cotton cloth has increased by about three times, which has greatly improved people's clothing problems. However, due to the high-speed development of socialist construction and the continuous improvement of people's living standards, the demand for cotton cloth is also increasing. To fully meet the clothing needs of the people across the country, we still need to make arduous efforts in many ways. Actively expanding raw material sources, making full use of various fibers, and increasing the production of various textiles are the main aspects. However, like increasing production, saving is also an important principle of socialist construction. Because saving, in the final analysis, is also for the purpose of increasing production. At any time, we must do everything possible to increase production, and at the same time, we must also do everything possible to save and rationally use raw materials, materials, and other resources. Whatever can be used less, we must never use more. Therefore, according to the demands of the masses, continuously improving clothing design, improving tailoring methods, and improving clothing quality, and using the same amount of materials to make more, better, and cheaper clothing should become the main content of the implementation of the general line of building socialism by all employees in the clothing industry. The employees of the clothing industry must exert their energy, study diligently, create boldly, and vigorously promote all effective advanced tailoring methods. At the same time, they should make full use of scraps, rags, and other leftovers to splice and sew children's clothing, schoolbags, and vests, and vigorously carry out dismantling, washing, sewing, mending, large to small alterations, and old to new renovations, opening up ways to increase production and save resources in many ways.

Tight nesting and rational use of cloth is an advanced experience that can both increase clothing production and reduce clothing costs, which is beneficial to the country and consumers. Now is the season for changing clothes in spring and summer. Under the leadership of the Party committees, local light industry departments and commercial departments should seize this favorable opportunity to quickly launch a high tide of promoting the advanced tailoring methods of tight nesting and rational use of cloth, and strive to make it blossom and bear fruit everywhere in the country in a relatively short period of time.

    全面推广先进剪裁方法
    本报评论员
    紧密排料、合理用布的先进剪裁方法，是我国服装行业在技术革新、技术革命运动中的一个伟大创造。在服装行业，多年来就有“七尺裤子八尺袄”的说法。意思是说，要做一套中等身材的衣服，没有十五尺布是不行的。有些人受这种说法的束缚，认为通过改革剪裁方法来节约用布是不可能的了，或者至少是“油水”不大了。现在，这种说法被紧密排料、合理用布的先进剪裁方法打破了。这种方法可以适用于剪裁各种衣服。不论是剪裁什么样的衣服，都能做到规格、质量符合实用、美观的要求，还可以节省材料。北京市一百多个缝纫社的门市部、四个工业服装厂和二十二个服务业的服装厂广泛采用这种剪裁方法，每做一套服装，长短肥瘦不变，可以少用布一尺到二尺左右。“七尺裤子八尺袄”，变成了“六尺裤子七尺袄”。每套衣服省一、二尺，是一件很了不起的大事情。古语有云：“集腋成裘”。我国有六亿五千万人，每人每年节约一点，加起来就是一个极其可观的数量。事实证明，通过改革剪裁方法来节约用布，不但是可为，而且是大有可为。
    建国十年来，我国的棉布产量增长了三倍左右，使人民的穿衣问题得到了很大的改善。但是，由于社会主义建设事业的高速度发展和人民生活水平的不断提高，棉布的需要量也越来越大，要充分满足全国人民的衣著需要，还需要我们从多方面进行艰苦的努力。积极扩大原料来源，充分利用各种纤维，增产各种纺织品，这是主要的方面。但是，跟增产一样，节约也是社会主义建设的一个重要的原则。因为节约，归根到底也是为了增产。无论在什么时候，我们都要千方百计地增加生产，同时也要千方百计地节约和合理使用原料、材料和其他资源。凡是可以少用的，我们决不要多用。因此，根据群众的要求，不断地改进服装设计，改进剪裁方法，提高服装质量，用同样多的材料，做出更多、更好、更便宜的服装来，应该成为服装行业全体职工贯彻执行建设社会主义总路线的主要内容。服装行业的职工一定要鼓足干劲，苦心钻研，大胆创造，大力推广一切行之有效的先进的剪裁方法，同时充分利用碎布、杂布等下脚料拼接缝制童装、书包、小背心，大力开展拆、洗、缝、补、大改小、旧翻新业务，从多方面开辟增产节约途径。
    紧密排料，合理用布，是一个既能增加服装生产，又能降低服装成本，既有利于国家，又有利于消费者的先进经验。现在正值春夏换衣季节，各地轻工业部门和商业部门，应当在党委的领导下，抓住这个有利时机，迅速掀起一个推广紧密排料、合理用布的先进剪裁方法的高潮，力争在比较短的时间内，使它在全国到处开花，到处结果。
