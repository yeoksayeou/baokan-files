    Talking About Coal
  　(Crosstalk) Zhang Lianjia
    [Performed by the Hebei Delegation]
    A: Seriously, what are you planning to talk about in this crosstalk today?
    B: I plan to talk to you about coal.
    A: Matchmaking? Matchmaking and pulling strings, that's what matchmakers in the old society did. In the new society, marriage is free!
    B: Hey, where are you going with this!
    A: Besides, I've been married for seven years, and my wife and I are living a happy life. Aren't you trying to ruin our family relationship?
    B: The "mei" I'm talking about is the coal you burn.
    A: Oh! So, you're very familiar with coal?
    B: Of course! It's my profession.
    A: Oh! You're a coal ball roller?
    B: My profession is working in a coal mine!
    A: Great! We're in the same profession.
    B: Oh, you also work in a coal mine.
    A: I work in a department store.
    B: This... we can't be in the same profession!
    A: I said I used to be in the same profession.
    B: Oh! You worked in a coal mine two years ago?
    A: Two years ago, I was in a food company.
    B: This... that's even more irrelevant!
    A: It's like this, I'm talking about before liberation, I worked in a coal mine. At that time, because I couldn't stand the oppression of the foreman, I escaped from the mine and wandered around. After liberation, I went to work in a food company, and last year I was transferred to a department store!
    B: Wow! What a detour!
    A: After all this talk, which coal mine do you work in?
    B: I work in the Kailuan Coal Mine in Tangshan.
    A: Tangshan Kailuan Coal Mine, that's great! I used to work there!
    B: Really!
    A: So, we're not only in the same profession but also in the same mine. Come, come, let's greet each other again!
        (Starts rhyming)
    B: Da da da tai! Are we starting a play?
    A: I'm so happy! Hey! How come I didn't see you?
    B: You can't see me! You're in a department store, and I'm in a coal mine. Where would you see me!
    A: No! I'm talking about when I went to Kailuan as part of a tour group recently. I didn't see you!
    B: Really! I didn't see you either!
    A: Oh! I understand! Probably we didn't run into each other. Because we didn't run into each other, I didn't see you. Because I didn't see you, you didn't see me either. If we had run into each other, I probably would have seen you! If I had seen you, you probably would have seen me!
    B: Isn't that too wordy?
    A: Speaking of this visit, looking at the present, and thinking about the past, it makes me feel infinitely emotional, infinitely excited, infinitely happy, infinitely pleased, infinitely delighted...
    B: Oh! You're getting carried away again!
    A: When I think back to the suffering I endured in Kailuan in the old society, how can I not be emotional! And looking at the soaring, rapidly advancing new Kailuan of the people in the past ten years since liberation, how can I not be delighted and encouraged?
    B: That's true. Hey! Could you talk to me about your personal experiences during this visit to Kailuan?
    A: Sure! Our tour group came to Kailuan and received a warm welcome from the leaders of the Party committee and the older worker brothers! The secretary of the Party committee shook my hand warmly and said: Old Zhang! Take a look at the huge changes in Kailuan over the past ten years! I was so excited! At that time, I looked into the crowd and saw him, him, and him in the welcoming team!
    B: Who are all these "hims"?
    A: They are all my old partners, Lao Zhao, Lao Li, and many other people. We were so happy to see each other! We shook hands warmly, embraced each other warmly, and didn't know what to say!
    B: Exciting!
    A: It took me a long time to say a word!
    B: What did you say?
    A: I said, I said... what did I say?
    B: How would I know!
    A: I said you guys are getting younger and younger!
    B: Hey! Can you say that! It's called getting more youthful as you live!
    A: Anyway, they're all over forty, but they all have rosy faces, just like young men in their twenties.
    B: People growing up in the Mao Zedong era are getting younger and younger!
    A: At that time, they all accompanied me on the tour. As we walked and talked, they said: All the employees of Kailuan are very motivated. In 1959, they completed the annual production tasks 19 days and two shifts ahead of schedule and were rated as a national red flag coal mine; this year, in the first quarter, another shift completed the quarterly production tasks seven days early, achieving a full house red in the first quarter.
    B: That's really good news.
    A: As we were talking, we arrived at the mine entrance, got into the cage, and with a swoosh, it felt like sitting in a helicopter...
    B: Wait a minute! This cage goes down, and a helicopter goes up. Your comparison is not appropriate.
    A: In my opinion, this comparison couldn't be more appropriate!
    B: How so?
    A: Let me ask you, what was the old mine like?
    B: It was hell on earth.
    A: Going down the mine was like going to hell. What is the current mine like?
    B: It's an underground paradise.
    A: That's right. Isn't it perfect to take a helicopter to paradise!
    B: He... Ugh! You're waiting for me here!
    A: We got out of the cage and happened to come across a coal car. I grabbed onto it with a whoosh!
    B: Why are you getting on the coal car!
    A: Everyone else said: What are you doing up there! I said that I'm completely familiar with this place. You don't have to worry about me. Don't we have to ride the coal car to visit the face? Everyone laughed!
    B: That's funny.
    A: They said: Now this coal car only hauls coal, it doesn't carry people! I asked what people ride. They said: Now people ride special cars! Come on! Let's get on the special car!
    B: That's right! Now everyone rides special cars!
    A: I didn't know! I got off the coal car and got on the special car. I took a look! ?! It's too luxurious! Everyone has a leather chair, sitting on it, swaying gently, it's so comfortable! These aren't miners! They're purely first-class soft-sleeper passengers!
    B: Why are you always swaying?
    A: Aren't I riding in a special car!
    B: I thought you had taken the wrong medicine!
    A: Who took the wrong medicine! We got out of the car, and came to the 5783 face...
    B: Hehe, I said, why are you still swaying after getting out of the car!
    A: I got out of the car, then I stopped swaying!
    B: Good!
    A: We came to the 5783 face and took a look! ?! ?! ??!
    B: What are you ?!?!ing about!
    A: It's all machines!
    B: Yes!
    A: They told me: Our mine has now been mechanized! Look! Coal cutting machines, coal loading machines, support machines, prop transport machines, and electric motors. Our miners just have to press the buttons and watch the machines!
    B: That's right; the workers have been liberated from heavy physical labor!
    A: Yes! Lao Li said: Due to vigorous technical innovation and continuous improvement of operating methods, coal mining on the face no longer requires manual labor! This is the unmanned working face.
    B: This is all the result of the Party's wise leadership.
    A: Seeing this, I couldn't help but feel a pang of sadness and shed tears.
    B: Hey! You should be happy to see these things! Why are you crying?
    A: It brought back my memories! Thinking back to when I was mining coal here before liberation, using the barbaric coal mining and collapse method, digging with a pickaxe one stroke at a time, carrying baskets one by one, I was so tired that my back ached, my legs hurt, my head was dizzy, and I was beaten by the foreman. Going down the mine was always life-threatening. Going down the coal mine was like going to the eighteenth level of hell: the capitalists only cared about making money, and didn't care about the lives of the workers. At that time, the death of a mule was worth forty yuan, and the death of a miner was only worth ten yuan! You're so cruel!
    B: Why are you coming at me!
    A: I'm too excited!
    B: Good! You scared me!
    A: They saw that I was sad and comforted me, and quickly led me to another face. When I got to this face, I took a look! ?! ?! ??!
    B: What are you ?!ing about again!
    A: I only saw: rolling waves, glittering silver light, a mountain torrent breaking out, a vast expanse of water. Seeing that the situation was not good, I felt flustered, trembling all over, my body like a sieve, I turned and ran, almost tripping and falling!
    B: Where did you get all these problems!
    A: Where's the water leak!
    B: That's not a water leak, that's hydraulic mining!
    A: Oh, this is hydraulic mining! How would I know! In the past, a water leak in the mine was the most terrible thing, but now they've turned the water hazard into water conservancy! Lao Zhao told me that hydraulic mining can improve efficiency dozens of times.
    B: Hydraulic mining is the most advanced experience!
    A: Going further, I looked up! ?!
    B: ?! ??!
    A: Why are you ?!ing too!
    B: I wouldn't ?! if you didn't ?!
    A: When I looked, they were going to fire!
    B: Fire what!
    A: There were a dozen or so flat-trajectory cannons set up!
    B: Those aren't flat-trajectory cannons, those are water guns for hydraulic mining!
    A: Oh! These are water guns! I saw a worker comrade holding a water gun! Aiming at the solid coal seam, shhh! ...
    B: Why are you coming at me again!
    A: And just like that he blew a hole through it! They told me that this method not only increased production but also eliminated rock dust. In addition, with the continuous improvement of ventilation equipment, silicosis, the most serious threat to workers' health, has been permanently eliminated. Now! You can't even get silicosis if you want to!
    B: That's right!
    A: I said, you weren't planning to get a little silicosis, were you?
    B: Ah! I didn't plan to!
    A: We were visiting when a health care vehicle came over from behind. Several cooks came down and took out health care meals from the carriage, one for each person. I reached out and got one for myself. I tasted the food, and it was fragrant, delicious, and hot.
    B: You! You can't forget eating wherever you go!
    A: I'm not greedy, it's just that when I used to go down the mine, I couldn't even get enough to eat with bean cakes. Today I'm tasting this health care meal to personally experience the happy life of miners in the new China!
    B: He always has something to say.
    A: That's why the miners are all so strong now! How can they not be strong eating this meal! You can't even get stomach problems eating this meal. I said, you weren't planning to get a little stomach problem, were you?
    B: Why are you always hoping I get sick!
    A: After we finished watching the mine, we returned to the surface and visited the various workshops. Guess what! The various workshops on the surface have also been mechanized, automated, and hydraulized...
    B: Wait a minute! The workshops have also been hydraulized!
    A: No! I'm talking about the bathhouse where the employees take showers. It's hydraulized!
    B: Ah! There's no such thing as a hydraulized bathhouse!
    A: What should the bathhouse be called then?
    B: In my opinion, the bathhouse should be called a reservoir!
    A: That's right! A reservoir... ah!
    B: Hey! I'm getting confused too!
    A: We also visited the workers' school. The miners now have culture and can all write poems to express their feelings and sing praises to the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune.
    B: That's right! The era of no culture is gone forever!
    A: We continued to move forward and visited the club and the gymnasium. The equipment is really complete.
    B: What equipment did you see in the gymnasium?
    A: There are basketballs, volleyballs, ping pong balls, soccer, tennis, badminton, as well as discus and shot put, high and low bars, parallel bars, champions emerge on the sports field, washbasins, steel woks, bananas, oranges, pineapples, soap, toilet soap, hygiene soap, fruit candy, big bread….
    B: Hey, what is this, a gymnasium!
    A: After I left the gymnasium, I went to our department store!
    B: Hey!

    们一边走一边谈，他们说：开滦
    的全体职工干劲可足啦，1959
    年提前十九天另两个班完成全
    年生产任务，被评为全国红旗
    煤矿；今年第一季度又提前七
    天另一个班，完成了全季生产
    任务，实现了首季满堂红。乙：真是捷报频传。甲：说着说着，我们就来到了井口，
    坐上了大罐，刷的一声，真像
    坐上直升飞机一样……乙：您先等等吧！这坐大罐是往下
    去，坐直升飞机是往上去，您
    这个比法不恰当。甲：要依我说这个比法，再恰当也
    没有啦！乙：怎么哪！甲：我问问你，过去的矿井！乙：那是人间地狱。甲：下矿井如同下地狱，如今的矿
    井哪！乙：是地下天堂。甲：还是的，上天堂坐直升飞机他
    不正好吗！乙：他……呕！在这儿等着我哪！甲：我们下了大罐，正赶上过来一
    趟煤斗车，我蹭一下子就抓上
    去啦！乙：你上煤斗车干嘛呀！甲：他们大伙也说：你上那上边干
    嘛去！我说到了这里边我完全
    内行，你们甭管我，咱们到礃
    上参观去不得坐煤斗车去吗？
    他们大伙这个乐呀！乙：是可乐。甲：他们说：现在这煤斗车光拉
    煤，他不坐人啦！我说人坐甚
    么呀！他们说：现在人都坐专
    车啦！来！咱们上专车吧！乙：对了！现在都坐专车啦！甲：我哪知道哇！我下了煤斗，上

    别提多舒服啦！这哪是矿工啊！
    纯粹是特快软席乘客！乙：我说你怎么老颤悠哇！甲：我这不是坐专车哪吗！乙：我当你吃错了药哪！甲：谁吃错了药啦！下了车，我们
    来到5783礃……乙：嘿嘿，我说您怎么下啦车还颤
    悠哇！甲：下车啦，下车那我就别颤悠啦！乙：好吗！甲：我们来到了5783礃上这么一看
    哪！?！?！??！乙：我说你??甚么呀！甲：那都是机器呀！乙：是呀！甲：他们跟我介绍说：现在咱们的
    矿井已经实现机械化啦！您看！
    割煤机、装煤机、支柱机、运柱
    机，还有电动机，咱们矿工只要
    按按电钮，看看机器就行啦！乙：对；工人们已然从笨重体力劳
    动中解放出来啦！甲：是呀！老李说：由于大搞技术
    革新，不断改进操作方法，礃
    上采煤，已经不用人工啦！
    这就是无人工作面。乙：这都是党英明领导的结果。甲：看到这儿，不由我一阵心酸掉
    下了眼泪。乙：哎！看到这些事儿，您应当高
    兴啊！怎么还掉眼泪呀！甲：勾起我的心事来啦！回想起解
    放前我在这儿挖煤的那时候，
    使用的是野蛮的采煤落垛法，
    用镐一下一下的刨，用筐一筐
    一筐的端，累得我腰酸腿疼，
    头昏眼花，受尽了把头的毒打，
    一进矿井时刻有性命的危险，
    下煤窑就如同下十八层地狱一
    样：资本家只顾赚钱，工人的
    死活不管，那个时候，死一匹
    骡子给四十块钱，死一个矿工
    只给十块钱！你们好狠哪！乙：我说你怎么冲我来啦！甲：我太激动啦！乙：好吗！吓我一跳！甲：他们看到我难过，直安慰我，赶
    紧把我领到另外一个礃上，到
    了这个礃上我这么一瞧啊！?！
    ?！??！乙：我说你怎么又??呀！甲：但只见：波浪滚滚，闪闪银光，
    山洪暴发，大水汪洋，见势不
    好，心里发慌、浑身乱抖，体
    似筛糠，拔腿就跑，差点来个
    蹦登呛！乙：你哪来这些毛病呀！甲：哪儿透水啦！乙：那不是透水，那是水力采煤！甲：噢，这就是水力采煤呀！我哪
    知道哇！过去井下一透水，那
    是最可怕的事情，可现在把水
    害变成水利啦！老赵跟我说，
    水力采煤能提高效率几十倍。乙：水力采煤是最先进的经验啦！甲：再往前走，我抬头一看哪！?！乙：?！??！甲：我说你怎么也??呀！乙：我不??你也??得呀！甲：我这么一看哪！这儿要开火儿！乙：开什么火儿呀！甲：那支着十几架平射炮哪！乙：那不是平射炮，那就是水力采
    煤用的水枪！甲：噢！这就是水枪啊！就瞧一位
    工人同志，拿着水枪！冲着坚
    固的煤层，哧！……乙：我说你怎么又冲我来啦！甲：一下子就穿了一个洞！他们跟
    我说，这种方法，不但提高了
    产量，而且消灭了岩尘，再加
    上不断改进通风设备，已经永
    远杜绝了危害工人健康最严重
    的矽肺病，这回呀！想得矽肺
    病都不成啦！乙：是呀！甲：我说您不是打算得点矽肺病吗！乙：啊！我没那个打算！甲：我们正参观着哪，从后边过来
    一趟保健车，下来几位炊事
    员，从车厢里端出了保健饭，
    是每人一份，当时我一伸手，
    也给我来了一份，我一尝这个
    饭菜又香又可口又热呼。乙：你呀！到哪儿也忘不了这吃！甲：我并不是馋，他是过去我下井
    那时候，吃豆饼都吃不饱，今
    天我尝尝这保健饭，为的是亲
    身体验一下新中国矿工的幸福
    生活！乙：他总有的说。甲：要不现在矿工身体都那么棒
    呢！吃这个饭哪能不棒啊！吃
    这个饭想得胃病都得不了，我
    说您不是打算得点胃病吗？乙：你怎么老盼着我得病啊！甲：我们看完了井下，又回到井上，
    参观了各个车间，您猜怎么着！
    井上的各个车间也都实现了机
    械化，自动化，水利化……乙：您先等等吧！车间也实现了水
    利化啦！甲：不是！我说的是职工洗澡的那
    个澡堂子它实现水利化啦！乙：啊！澡堂子也没有叫水利化的！甲：您说这澡堂子应该叫甚么化
    呢？乙：要依我说这澡堂子它应该叫水
    库化！甲：对！水库……啊！乙：嗐！我这也乱了！甲：我们还参观了工人业校，现在
    的矿工都有了文化，全能提笔
    写诗抒发胸怀，歌颂总路线、
    大跃进和人民公社。乙：是呀！没有文化的时代已然一
    去不复返啦！甲：我们继续往前走，参观了俱乐
    部，体育馆，这设备真叫齐
    全。乙：您在体育馆都看见什么设备啦！甲：有篮球、排球、乒乓球、足球网
    球、羽毛球，还有铁饼和铅球，
    高低栏，单双杠，运动场上出健
    将，洗脸盆、钢种锅、香蕉桔
    子大菠萝、香皂、肥皂、卫生
    皂、水果糖、大面包……。乙：哎，我说这是体育馆哪！甲：我出了体育馆，又绕到我们百
    货公司去啦！乙：嗐！
