Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin. Hebei Province adheres to the方針 of "walking on two legs", self-reliance, and high-speed development of the petroleum industry. While tapping the production potential of existing oil plants, it continues to vigorously develop "small foreign group" synthetic petroleum plants and engage in the comprehensive utilization of coal to increase crude oil production and support industrial and agricultural production and construction.

In 1960, Hebei Province's crude oil production target increased by more than six times compared to last year. To ensure the completion of the task, the provincial petroleum industry department, in addition to further strengthening technological transformation and increasing crude oil production at existing oil plants, decided to continue vigorously developing "small foreign group" synthetic petroleum plants. According to preliminary plans, the province will build dozens of small synthetic petroleum plants with an annual output of 300 to 3,000 tons of crude oil this year, adding more than double the crude oil production and processing capacity of existing oil plants. These new plants will all be built in areas with oil shale and small-kiln coal suitable for use as refining raw materials, ensuring an ample supply of raw materials. Currently, various localities are stepping up preparations for materials and civil construction. A batch of pile furnaces and square furnaces being built in Chengde, Tangshan, Tanggu and other regions are undergoing intensive civil construction. Complete sets of dry distillation and processing machinery and equipment allocated by the Provincial Chemical Petroleum Bureau for these plants have been transported to the construction sites. A large number of new oil plants across the province also started construction successively in mid-to-late April.

In terms of petroleum production, the comprehensive utilization of coal is very important. This year, in addition to building a batch of shale oil plants and coal-to-oil plants, Hebei Province will also vigorously engage in coking to recover oil, increasing crude oil production. Nearly 300 earthen coke ovens across the province have been equipped with tar recovery equipment, ensuring that oil is recovered whenever coking takes place. Since April, the average daily output of tar has increased by more than two times compared to the first quarter. Many coke plants have already used the recovered tar to process various petroleum products such as gasoline, diesel, carbon black, and anti-corrosion oil.

In order to develop the petroleum industry at high speed, Hebei Province recently held a petroleum industry conference to specifically deploy this year's crude oil production tasks, determining that supporting the continued leap forward in agriculture should be the general 方針, continuously expanding the scope of comprehensive utilization, strengthening equipment maintenance and repair, and improving production systems. Furthermore, the conference formally included the use of indigenous methods for coking and recovering crude oil into the production plan, requiring the employees of coke plants in various localities to rely on their own efforts, focusing on indigenous methods, and further engage in indigenous recovery methods.

Guangzhou, 10th. Guangdong Province is actively carrying out the work of using peat as raw material to establish small refineries for extracting petroleum.

Guangdong Province has abundant reserves of peat. According to preliminary estimates, the province's reserves exceed 31 million tons. Moreover, this resource is widely distributed, with almost every county having it. The oil content of peat in Guangdong Province is very high, averaging over 60%. Due to the shallow topsoil and thick mineral layers, mining is very convenient. In the past, people only knew that peat could be used as fertilizer. Extracting petroleum from it was a new discovery during the Great Leap Forward in 1958. Subsequently, various localities established fourteen experimental small refineries, producing 753 tons of oil last year.

Building small peat refineries has the characteristics of simple equipment, low investment, fast construction, easy operation, and not-too-complex technology. Therefore, rural people's communes in various localities can build factories on the spot using both "small indigenous groups" and "small foreign groups" methods. Judging from the small refineries that have already been built, a factory with an annual output of 300 tons of crude oil only needs an exhaust fan, a water pump, and an 18-horsepower power machine. The total investment is only about 10,000 yuan, and it can be built in twenty days. The light diesel oil produced by such a refinery can supply thirteen tractors for one year. In addition, it can also obtain 75 tons of heavy diesel, 15 tons of kerosene for lighting, 3 tons of gasoline, 24 tons of anti-corrosion materials, 15 tons of paraffin wax, 12 tons of light phenol, and 6 tons of ammonium sulfate; in addition, there are large amounts of gas and sewage used for fertilizing fields.

Although small refineries in Guangdong Province that use peat as raw material are currently still in the development and initial stage, the advantages it has shown in terms of agricultural technology transformation are already very obvious. Therefore, the relevant leading organs in Guangdong Province attach great importance to this work. They have already regarded peat refining as a key point for vigorously engaging in comprehensive utilization. In order to vigorously promote this matter, a site meeting was recently held in Zhongshan County. The meeting also decided that all people's communes with raw materials and conditions should establish one or two small refineries, striving to achieve "every county has an oil plant and every commune with conditions also runs an oil plant" in a short period of time. The preliminary plan is for the province to strive to establish 200 small refineries with an annual output of 300 tons of crude oil this year.

    河北广东大办石油“小洋群”
    河北一批小型炼油厂正在加紧施工　广东积极推行用坭炭提炼石油
    据新华社天津电　河北省坚持两条腿走路、自力更生、高速度发展石油工业的方针，在挖掘现有石油厂生产潜力的同时，继续大办“小洋群”人造石油厂和大搞煤炭综合利用，增产原油，支持工农业生产建设。
    1960年，河北省石油产量任务比去年增长六倍多。省石油工业部门为了保证完成任务，除对现有石油厂进一步加强技术改造、提高原油产量外，决定继续大办“小洋群”人造石油厂。按照初步规划，全省今年要新建几十座年产原油三百至三千吨的小型人造石油厂，新增原油生产和加工总能力为现有油厂的一倍多。这些新厂都将建设在有油母页岩和适用于作炼油原料的小窑煤产地，炼油原料有充分保证。目前，各地正在加紧筹备材料和进行土建施工；承德、唐山、塘沽等地区建设的一批成堆炉和方型炉，土建工程正加紧施工。省化工石油局为这些厂配备的成套干馏、加工机械设备，已经运到工地。全省还有一大批新建石油厂在4月中下旬陆续动工兴建。
    在石油生产方面，煤炭综合利用十分重要。今年河北省除了建设一批页岩油厂与煤炼油厂外，还将大搞炼焦收油，增产原油。现在全省已有将近三百座土焦窑安上了焦油回收设备，作到了炼焦必收油。4月份以来焦油平均日产量比第一季度提高了二倍多。许多焦厂已用回收的焦油加工制成汽油、柴油、炭黑、防腐油等多种石油产品。
    为了高速度地发展石油工业，河北省最近召开了石油工业会议，具体地部署了今年原油生产任务，确定以支援农业继续跃进为总的方针，不断扩大综合利用范围，加强设备维护检修和健全生产制度；并且把土法炼焦回收原油正式列入生产计划，要求各地焦厂职工自力更生、以土为主，进一步大搞土法回收。
    本报广州10日电　广东省利用坭炭作原料，建立小型炼油厂提炼石油的工作正在积极进行。
    广东坭炭蕴藏量丰富，据初步估计，全省藏量在三千一百万吨以上。而且这种资源分布面很广，差不多每个县都有。广东省的坭炭含油率很高，平均在60％以上。由于表土浅，矿层厚，开采十分方便。以往，人们只知道坭炭可以用作肥料。从中提炼石油，这是1958年大跃进当中的新发现。接着各地办起了试验性的小型炼油厂十四座，去年产油七百五十三吨。
    建造坭炭小型炼油厂，具有设备简单，投资少，建厂快，操作容易，技术不太复杂等特点。因此各地农村人民公社都可以用小土群和小洋群的办法就地办厂。从已经建成的小型炼油厂来看，一座年产三百吨原油的工厂，只要一部排风机，一台水泵，另加一部十八马力的动力机即可。全部投资不过一万元，二十天就可以建成。这样一座炼油厂出的轻柴油，可供十三台拖拉机用一年。此外，还可以得到七十五吨重柴油，十五吨点灯用的煤油，三吨汽油，二十四吨防腐用料，十五吨石蜡，十二吨轻酚，六吨硫铵；此外还有大量的煤气和用作肥田的污水等。
    广东省以坭炭为原料的小型炼油厂，目前虽然还处在发展和初创阶段，但它在农业技术改造方面所显示出来的优越性，已经十分明显。因此，广东省有关领导机关十分重视这项工作，他们已经把坭炭炼油作为大搞综合利用的重点。为了大力推广这件事情，最近还在中山县召开了现场会议。会上还决定凡是有原料和有条件的人民公社，都要举办一个或者两个小型炼油厂，力争在短时期内做到县县有油厂和有条件的公社也办油厂。初步规划今年全省争取建立年产三百吨原油的小型炼油厂二百个。
