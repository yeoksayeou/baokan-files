Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 20th Dispatch: The American ruling group expressed satisfaction with the ugly affair of the Kishi Nobusuke traitorous clique in Japan using police violence to force the Japanese House of Representatives to "pass" the US-Japan military alliance treaty, and revealed that the United States also intends to approve this treaty before Eisenhower goes to Japan in mid-June.

White, a spokesman for the US State Department, said at a press conference on the 19th that he was satisfied with the Kishi Nobusuke clique's approval of the treaty. The news said that the United States was "particularly satisfied" with this action taken by the Kishi Nobusuke clique after the United States sabotaged the summit conference.

These messages say that after the Kishi Nobusuke clique approves this treaty, the US State Department will also ask the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to take swift action, and this committee chairman Fulbright will "almost certainly fulfill the State Department's wishes."

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 21st Dispatch: Acting US Secretary of State Dillon greatly praised the running dog Kishi Nobusuke for using violent means to illegally force the "passage" of the US-Japan military alliance treaty on the 20th, saying that this was "the most satisfying thing" for the American ruling group.

Dillon said at a luncheon celebrating the so-called 100th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and Japan (actually, the United States used gunboat diplomacy to open the door of Japan a hundred years ago, forcing Japan to sign its first unequal treaty) that "implementing the new treaty of common cooperation and security, and making it an increasingly strong force for maintaining peace and security in the Far East" is a step in developing the "indestructible partnership" between the United States and Japan. Dillon said, "The House of Representatives of the Japanese Diet took a big step in this direction yesterday. Its approval of this treaty is the most satisfying thing for all of America's friends in Japan."

Dillon greatly touted the "partnership" and "intimacy" between the United States and Japan. He said that Kishi Nobusuke signed the new US-Japan military treaty in the White House at the beginning of this year, "laying a solid foundation for the next century."

Dillon made it clear that as the price for signing the new US-Japan military treaty, the United States will further support the expansion of Japanese monopoly capital into underdeveloped countries in Asia.

    加紧复活日本军国主义策划侵略战争
    美国急需提前批准日美条约
    狄龙对岸信介的暴行大为满意
    新华社20日讯　华盛顿消息：美国统治集团对日本岸信介卖国集团用警察暴力强使日本众议院“通过”日美军事同盟条约这件丑事表示满意，并且透露，美国也打算在艾森豪威尔6月中旬到日本去之前批准这个条约。
    美国国务院发言人怀特19日在记者招待会上说，对岸信介集团批准这个条约感到满意。消息说，美国对岸信介集团是在美国破坏首脑会议以后采取的这种行动“特别感到满意”。
    这些消息说，在岸信介集团批准这个条约后，美国国务院也将要求参议院外交委员会迅速采取行动，而这个委员会主席富布赖特“几乎一定会满足国务院的愿望”。
    据新华社21日讯　华盛顿消息：美国代理国务卿狄龙20日对走狗岸信介施用暴力手段非法强行“通过”日美军事同盟条约大为夸奖，表示这是美国统治集团“感到最满意的事”。
    狄龙在庆祝所谓美日建交一百周年（实际上是美国在一百年前用炮舰打开了日本的大门，迫使日本签订了第一个不平等条约）的午宴会上发表演说时说什么“贯彻新的共同合作和安全条约，并使它成为远东的一支日益增强的维护和平及安全的力量”是发展美日两国“不可破坏的伙伴关系”的步骤。狄龙说，“日本国会的众议院昨天朝这一方向走了一大步。它批准这个条约是日本在美国的所有的朋友感到最满意的事”。
    狄龙大事吹嘘美国和日本的“伙伴关系”和“亲密”。他说，岸信介今年年初在白宫签订了新美日军事条约，是“为今后一个世纪奠定了稳固的基础”。
    狄龙表明，作为签订新日美军事条约这一卖身契的代价，美国将更加支持日本垄断资本向亚洲不发达国家扩张。
