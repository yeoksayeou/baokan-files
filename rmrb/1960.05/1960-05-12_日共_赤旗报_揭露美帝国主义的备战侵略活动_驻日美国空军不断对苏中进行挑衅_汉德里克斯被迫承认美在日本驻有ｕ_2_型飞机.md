Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo:

    The Japanese Communist Party's "Akahata" recently published an article entitled "US Forces Stationed in Japan Attempting to Invade the Far East," exposing how the US is turning Japan into a source of war in Asia. The article states, "Using more than a dozen airfields in important locations throughout Japan as bases, the US forces stationed in Japan are conducting reconnaissance and enemy search operations day and night towards the Far East region, including the Korean Peninsula, the Soviet Union, and the Chinese coast, ready to engage in combat at any time. They are prepared to launch bombers carrying atomic and hydrogen bombs on a large scale once war breaks out, while also deploying nuclear-armed ground combat troops. To ensure this, Article 5 of the (US-Japan) Administrative Agreement specifically exempts American aircraft from the obligation to notify when entering and leaving Japanese airfields, and this privilege has been retained unchanged in the new agreement."

    The article says, "Relying on unrestricted entry rights and absolute base management rights, the US military can bring in atomic bombs, hydrogen bombs, and missiles without even the government knowing. The US military occupies fourteen airfields (including the US naval air bases in Atsugi and Iwakuni), covering an area of 18.34 million *ping* (one *ping* is approximately 3.3 square meters), flying back and forth in our skies as if they were in their own territory." The article states that the US Fifth Air Force "has already launched attacks in Vietnam." In addition, the training of air force personnel from South Korea, the Chiang Kai-shek clique, the Philippines, and Thailand is also conducted at bases in Japan. The article also states, "Japan's Air Self-Defense Force is also incorporated into this command system and is subject to the operational control of the US military commander."

    The article also says that the Third Bombardment Wing, the main offensive force of the US Fifth Air Force, flew tens of thousands of sorties from Johnson Air Base in Japan during the Korean War, "dropping 120,000 tons of bombs across the 38th parallel."

    The US Air Force reconnaissance units in Japan also provide intelligence for all US military bases in the Far East and Southwest Pacific, including Okinawa, South Korea, and Guam. Last year, they sent "black jets" without international markings to intrude into the airspace of the Soviet Union and China to conduct reconnaissance of weather conditions, radar bases, and missile bases. The article says that, not only that, but the ninety B-47 bombers of the two Strategic Air Force wings stationed in Guam are also "constantly maintained in wartime readiness, and the sight of these B-47s loaded with nuclear bombs can be seen at various bases in Japan."

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 11th: According to Kyodo News, US Forces Japan Chief of Staff Major General Hendricks was forced to admit on the 9th that US U-2 aircraft have been "stationed at (US) air and naval bases in Japan for three or four years."

    This American official revealed this to officials of the Japanese "Defense Agency." However, he attempted to deny the fact, revealed by the Japanese public, that US U-2 aircraft were conducting espionage activities against China and the Soviet Union. He claimed that "the mission of U-2 aircraft varies somewhat depending on the time and place," that "the aircraft stationed in Japan are exclusively for meteorological observation," and that there was no "secrecy."

    Even the Associated Press had to admit that this despicable denial by the United States could not fool anyone. In its dispatch from Tokyo on the 9th, the news agency said: "Although US Air Force authorities claim that the U-2 aircraft that made a forced landing last year was engaged in meteorological reconnaissance at the time, few Japanese believe these words."

    日共“赤旗报”揭露美帝国主义的备战侵略活动
    驻日美国空军不断对苏中进行挑衅
    汉德里克斯被迫承认美在日本驻有Ｕ—2型飞机
    据新华社讯　东京消息：日本“赤旗报”最近发表题为“企图侵略远东的驻日美军”的文章，揭露美国把日本变成亚洲的战争策源地的情况。文章说，“驻日美军以日本整个国土的各个重要地方的十多个飞机场为基地，不分昼夜地向包括朝鲜半岛、苏联和中国沿岸的远东地区采取着随时可以投入战斗的侦察、搜索敌人的行动，准备一旦燃起战火，就可大举出动载有原子弹、氢弹的轰炸机、同时把核武装起来的地面战斗部队投入战斗。为了保障这一点，（美日）行政协定第五条特别免除了美国飞机进出日本飞机场时需要通知的义务，在新协定中也原封不动地保留了这个特权。”
    文章说，“美军靠了没有限制的入国权利和绝对的基地管理权，即使运进了原子弹、氢弹、导弹，就连政府也是不能知道的。美军占据着十四个飞机场（包括厚木、岩国的美海军航空基地在内），面积达一千八百三十四万坪（一坪约合三·三平方米），在我国上空完全像在它自己的领空中一样地来回飞行。”文章说，美国第五航空队“已经出击过越南”。此外，南朝鲜、蒋介石集团、菲律宾、泰国的空军人员的训练也是在日本基地内进行的。文章还说，“日本的航空自卫队也编入这个指挥体系中，接受美军司令官的作战管理。”
    文章还说，美国第五航空队的进攻主力第三轰炸联队在朝鲜战争中曾经从日本的约翰逊基地出动过数万架次飞机，“它们越过三八线投下了十二万吨炸弹。”
    在日本的美国空军侦察部队还为冲绳、南朝鲜、关岛等远东、西南太平洋的全部美军基地提供情报。去年它们曾派没有国际标记的“黑色喷气机”侵入苏联、中国的领空，侦察气象情况、雷达基地和导弹基地。文章说，不仅如此，部署在关岛的战略空军两个联队的九十架Ｂ—47型轰炸机还“经常保持战时体制，装载着核弹的这些Ｂ—47的姿态在日本的各个基地都能看到。”
    据新华社11日讯　东京消息：据共同社报道，驻日美军司令部参谋长汉德里克斯少将9日被迫承认，美国的Ｕ—2型飞机“三四年以来就驻在（美国）驻日海空军基地”。
    这位美国官员是向日本“防卫厅”官员透露这件事的。但是，他却企图抵赖被日本公众揭露出来的美国Ｕ—2型飞机对中国和苏联进行特务活动的事实。他说什么“Ｕ—2型飞机的任务，因时因地会多少有些不同”，“驻在日本的这种飞机专作气象观测”，而且也没有“保密”。
    美国这种卑劣的抵赖伎俩甚至连美联社也不得不承认它骗不了人。这家通讯社在它9日从东京发出的电讯中说：“虽然美国空军当局声称去年迫降的那架Ｕ—2型飞机当时是从事侦察气象情况的活动，可是，很少日本人相信这些话”。
