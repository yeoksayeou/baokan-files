Xinhua News Agency, May 15th: The All-China Youth Federation and the All-China Students' Federation jointly sent a telegram on the 14th to the National Council to Prevent Revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" in Japan, representing 130 million youths and students across the country, resolutely supporting the Japanese people and youth in their 16th national unified action to completely smash the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.

The telegram said: "In the just struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, which is becoming more and more massive, the Japanese people and youth have fully demonstrated their powerful strength. The current magnificent 16th unified action is even more forcefully striking at the Nobusuke Kishi government's attempt to force the Japanese Diet to pass the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and the conspiracy of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries to plan a war of aggression. Chinese youth are enthusiastically cheering for the victories achieved by the Japanese people and youth in their patriotic and just anti-U.S. struggle.

"U.S. imperialism has done all kinds of bad things all over the world, and it is the most ferocious enemy of all oppressed nations and peace-loving people. The powder keg under the feet of U.S. imperialism is exploding one after another. In Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the flames of patriotic and just struggles against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs are burning everywhere. The days of U.S. imperialists are not far off. The fate of the Nobusuke Kishi reactionary clique, which betrays the interests of the Japanese nation, will be no better than that of Syngman Rhee. The just struggle of the Japanese people and youth has received widespread support from the people of the world. Chinese youth will always stand by your side and resolutely support your struggle to the end. The awakened Japanese people and youth must continuously strengthen unity, heighten vigilance, and persist in struggle. The U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty must be crushed, and the aggressive conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and the Nobusuke Kishi reactionary clique must be destroyed. Final victory will surely belong to the Japanese people and youth."
