    Yang Mao Xuan Has Changed Its Appearance
    By our reporter Jin Yuanming
    When people come to Minhe County in eastern Qinghai Province, they all want to see Yang Mao Xuan. Yang Mao Xuan is a production team under the Bazhou Commune in Minhe County. Like many mountainous areas on the Northwest Loess Plateau, it used to suffer from severe soil erosion. However, because the 187 Hui commune members of this production team resolutely listened to the Party's words, especially relying on the superiority of the "large-scale and public" people's commune, and vigorously launched a mass movement to control mountains and rivers, they finally changed the face of the mountainous area at an astonishing speed.
              Worthy of its Name
    From Minhe County, going upstream along the Bazhou River for more than 30 li, and climbing a mountain ridge to the east, one can see that Yang Mao Xuan is indeed worthy of its name. Terraced fields are densely distributed along the mountain's contours, and various soil and water conservation projects such as flood control dams and gully dams are built from the bottom of the gullies to the top. The large and small ponds set up on both sides of the field roads are connected by countless crisscrossing drainage ditches, which can intercept floods from all directions. Wild grass grows on the hillsides, and small trees are sprouting in the dense layers of crescent-shaped pits and contour ditches. It is through these projects, as well as planting trees and grass, that people are rapidly changing the natural appearance of Yang Mao Xuan. Now, out of the team's more than 46,000 mu of mountainous area, 40,000 mu have been brought under control. Because the fertile soil has been preserved and the moisture retained, although there was another spring drought this year, the soil in those terraced fields is moist and black, and will no longer be threatened by drought.
            Painful Past
    Yang Mao Xuan used to be a good place for grazing cattle and sheep, and people called it Yang Mao Quan (sheep wool pen). But during the years of rule by the reactionary classes, the forests were severely damaged, a large amount of soil was lost, and crop yields declined year after year, leaving the vast number of peasants struggling on the verge of death for a long time. According to a survey at the time of liberation in 1949, out of the 141 households in the village, excluding landlords, rich peasants, and some well-to-do middle peasants, 116 households were unable to get enough to eat and were poorly clothed. At that time, 65 households in the village left their homes and fled.
          Organized, Great Strength
    Rapidly changing the face of the mountainous area was a long-cherished desire of the people. Since the emergence of advanced agricultural cooperatives in Yang Mao Xuan, the curtain has finally been raised on a battle to conquer nature.
    In 1956, Ma Yongqing, the deputy director of the agricultural cooperative, returned from a soil and water conservation training class in the county and proposed to the cooperative to vigorously develop soil and water conservation. With the support of the Party organization, the agricultural cooperative selected 13 Party members, League members, and young activists to first build 13 ponds, 28 gully dams, and 240 mu of field ridges in Kongjia Gully, which had the most serious soil erosion, and planted millet, vegetables, and other crops, so that this harmful gully, which used to yield little even if planted, earned more than 110 yuan that year. The following year, there was a severe drought that had not been seen for many years, but the crops planted in this gully grew a foot taller than the crops in other fields. The average yield per mu of a piece of highland barley planted on the platform at the bottom of the gully was five times higher than that of ordinary fields, which further strengthened the confidence and determination of the cooperative members to transform the mountainous area. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the township Party committee, based on the urgent demands of the masses, organized a cooperative corps of 1,800 people throughout the township, who worked hard for more than 30 days and built many projects that the Yang Mao Xuan agricultural cooperative alone could not have built. As soon as the people's commune was established, the commune Party committee mobilized thousands of laborers from the entire commune to support the soil and water conservation project in Yang Mao Xuan. Under the strong leadership of the commune Party committee, they fought hard for seven days and nights and brought more than 10,000 mu of soil erosion area under control, accounting for more than a quarter of the total area controlled in recent years, and the quality was very good. In late July 1959, they encountered a heavy rain that had not been seen for many years, with 100 millimeters of rainfall in 25 minutes, but all the projects were safe and sound. At this time, ponds, contour ditches, and crescent-shaped pits were filled with rainwater all over the mountains and fields; at night, the accumulated water sparkled under the reflection of the starlight. The cooperative members deeply felt that: when organized, there is great strength, and people can conquer nature.
      Comprehensive Development of Various Productions
    The mass movement to vigorously control mountains and rivers has not only rapidly changed the natural appearance of the mountainous area, but also promoted the all-round leap-forward development of various productions in the whole team. In 1958, the total grain output of the whole team increased by 1.4 times compared with the time of liberation; in 1959, it increased by 15.7% compared with the Great Leap Forward in 1958, and the yield per unit area increased by 22% compared with 1958. In terms of forestry, the whole team has afforested more than 5,500 mu of various trees, including 2,000 mu of fruit trees such as walnuts, apricots, apples, and sand dates, with an average of 46 walnut trees and 743 apricot trees per household. Due to the abundance of water and grass, the total number of large livestock in the whole team increased by a net 11% compared with 1955 before the vigorous control of water and soil, sheep increased by more than doubled, and poultry and livestock such as chickens and rabbits increased by more than five times. The remarkable achievements gained from vigorously controlling mountains and rivers have also opened up broad avenues for sideline production. The total income from sideline occupations such as broom-making, digging medicinal materials, and twisting straw ropes in the whole team last year increased by more than six times compared with 1955. With the all-round development of various productions, the material and cultural life of the vast number of cooperative members has also been greatly improved. Last year, the average income per labor force in the whole team reached 225 yuan, and the average income per person was 92 yuan. At the same time, the team also established clubs, libraries, supply and marketing cooperatives, schools, and clinics, and all school-age children went to school. Before liberation, there was not a single literate person in the whole team, but now 131 young and middle-aged cooperative members have shaken off the label of illiteracy, and many people have reached the cultural level of junior high school. The saying that used to be popular among the masses, "There is no future on the mountains, the soil and water flow downward; if you want to turn over early, you should still go down the mountain," has now become a paean of "The mountains are beautiful, the mountains are full of treasures, the soil and water do not flow downward, and the land is green."
          Greater Ambition
    Although the soil and water conservation project in Yang Mao Xuan has achieved great success, they are not satisfied with this. They are determined to further realize the more beautiful ideal of "terraced fields of rice and grain, gullies of flowers and fruits, chickens, rabbits, ducks and fish full of mountain bays, and a new communist paradise."

    羊毛宣变了样
    本报记者　金元明
    来到青海省东部的民和县，人们都想着去看看羊毛宣。羊毛宣是民和县巴州公社的一个生产队。它和西北黄土高原上的许多山区一样，曾经是水土流失非常严重的地方。但由于这个生产队的一百八十七户回族社员，坚决听党的话，特别是依靠了人民公社“一大二公”的优越性，大搞治山治水的群众运动，终于以惊人的速度，一举改变了山区面貌。
              名不虚传
    从民和县城沿巴州河南上三十多里，登上东面的一道山岭，极目四望，羊毛宣果真名不虚传。层层梯田顺着山势密布，防洪坝、谷坊等各种拦蓄水土的工程，从沟底一直筑到沟顶。设置在田间道路两旁的大小涝池，被无数纵横交错的流水沟串连起来，可以拦蓄来自四面八方的洪水。山坡上野草丛生，在密密层层的月牙坑、水平沟里，一棵棵小树正在抽芽。人们就是通过这些工程以及种树、种草等措施，迅速改变着羊毛宣的自然面貌。现在，全队四万六千多亩山区面积，已经治理好四万亩。由于保存了肥土，含蓄了水分，今年虽然又遇到了春旱，但在那块块梯田里，土壤湿润发黑，再也受不到干旱的威胁了。
            苦难的过去
    羊毛宣本是个放牧牛羊的好地方，那时群众都叫它做羊毛圈。但在历代反动阶级统治的年代里，山林遭受到严重的破坏，泥土大量流失，农作物产量一年不如一年，广大农民长期挣扎在死亡的边缘上。据1949年解放时的调查，全村一百四十一户人家，除地主、富农和一部分富裕中农外，就有一百一十六户人家食不果腹，衣不蔽体。当时全村有六十五户人家离乡背井，逃亡外出。
          组织起来力量大
    迅速改变山区面貌，是人们长久酝酿着的愿望。自从羊毛宣出现了高级农业社，一场战胜自然的序幕终于揭开了。
    1956年，农业社副主任马永清从县上的水土保持训练班学习归来，向社里提出大搞水土保持的建议。在党组织的支持下，农业社抽调出十三名党员、团员和青年积极分子，首先在水土流失最严重的孔家沟，修起十三个涝池、二十八座谷坊、二百四十亩地埂，并种了糜谷、蔬菜等各种作物，使这个往年十种九不收的害沟，当年就收益一百一十多元。第二年，遇到了多年未有的大旱，但种在这条沟里的庄稼，却比其他地里的庄稼长得高出一尺。其中种在沟底台地上的一块青稞，平均亩产比一般田高五倍，这就更加坚定了社员们改造山区的信心和决心。1958年大跃进，当时的乡党委就根据群众的迫切要求，在全乡范围内组织了一千八百人的协作兵团，突击三十多天，修成了只靠羊毛宣一个农业社无法修成的许多工程。人民公社一成立，公社党委就在全社范围内抽调了成千名劳力，支援羊毛宣的水土保持工程。他们在公社党委的坚强领导下，奋战七个昼夜，就治理水土流失面积一万多亩，占几年来治理面积总和的四分之一以上，而且质量很好。1959年7月下旬，遇到了多年未有的暴雨，在二十五分钟内降雨一百毫米，但全部工程安然无恙。这时，满山遍野的涝池、水平沟、月牙坑都蓄满了雨水；到了晚上，积水在星光的反照下闪闪发光。社员们深深地感到：组织起来力量大，战胜自然人胜天。
      各项生产全面发展
    大搞治山治水的群众运动，不仅迅速改变着山区自然面貌，也促使全队各项生产有了全面飞跃的发展。1958年全队粮食总产量比解放时增长了一点四倍；1959年又比大跃进的1958年增长了15.7％，单位面积产量比1958年增长了22％。在林业方面，全队共营造各种林木五千五百多亩，其中核桃、杏子、苹果、沙枣等果树占二千亩，平均每户有核桃树四十六株、杏树七百四十三株。由于水草不缺，全队大家畜比大搞治水治山前的1955年净增11％，羊增加了一倍多，鸡、兔等家禽家畜增长五倍以上。大搞治山治水所获得的显著成效，也给副业生产打开了广阔的门路。全队去年扎扫帚、挖药材、拧草绳等项副业总收入，比1955年增加了六倍多。随着各项生产的全面发展，广大社员的物质文化生活也有了很大提高。全队去年每个劳力平均收入达到二百二十五元，平均每人收入九十二元。与此同时，队里还建立了俱乐部、图书室、供销部、学校和医务所，学龄儿童全部上了学。解放前，全队没有一个识字的人，现在已有一百三十一名青壮年社员摘掉了文盲帽子，有不少人达到初中文化水平。过去群众中流传着的“山上没奔头，水土往下流；要想早翻身，还是下山头”的说法，如今已变成了“山上就是美，满山是宝贝，水土不下流，遍地绿油油”的颂歌。
          更大的雄心
    羊毛宣的水土保持工程虽然取得了巨大成就，但他们并不以此为满足。他们决心为进一步实现“梯田米粮川，沟壑花果园，鸡兔鱼鸭满山湾，共产主义新乐园”的更加美好的理想而奋斗。
