Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 17th: Approximately six hundred leading figures from the Japanese cultural world participated in a rally held today by the "Security Treaty Criticism Group," expressing strong opposition to the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and resolutely demanding the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke government.

They held a demonstration after the meeting, submitting a petition to the Diet demanding that the Diet pass a resolution of no confidence in the Kishi Nobusuke government.

At the rally, representatives of writers, critics, scholars, stage actors, and religious figures took to the stage one after another, all expressing their determination to fight to prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty" and to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke government.

Nakajima Kenzo said: "The Kishi Nobusuke government, which subserviently obeys American instructions without listening to the voices of the Japanese people, can no longer be considered the government of Japan." A woman representing the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) said: "The YWCA has already collected more than 10,000 signatures against the Security Treaty, and these signatures have been submitted to the Diet. Today, we will bring more than 1,250 signatures collected since then to the Diet."

A Buddhist representative said indignantly, "Kishi Nobusuke is now blinded by his excessive greed for power." He said, "We cannot hand over our politics to madmen to manage."

Next, actress Yamamoto Yasue read a statement issued by thirty-four theater troupes, including Haiyuza and Zenshinza. The statement emphasized that Japanese actors and actresses cannot tolerate the Diet passing the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" because the new treaty is aimed at China, and Japan has not yet apologized to China for its crimes of aggression.

The participants in the rally unanimously passed a resolution demanding the abolition of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke government.

After the meeting, they held a demonstration. As they marched toward the Diet, the demonstrators sang "Peace to Asia," with lyrics by Tatsuzo Ishikawa, and the Buddhists beat drums.

Chairman of the Socialist Party Inejiro Asanuma received their petition at the Diet. He addressed the petitioners, saying that the majority of seats held by the Liberal Democratic Party in the Diet is inconsistent with the majority opinion of the people. Asanuma emphasized: "Therefore, the Diet should be dissolved immediately."

The petitioners then went to the Prime Minister's official residence, demanding to see Kishi Nobusuke himself. They held a sit-in demonstration in front of the Prime Minister's official residence. Finally, they received the promise that Kishi Nobusuke would meet with eleven representatives of the "Security Treaty Criticism Group" tomorrow.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 17th: Approximately forty university professors and other well-known figures from the cultural world in the Kansai area of Osaka City held a gathering on the evening of the 16th to express their opposition to the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

Among these people were Hiroshi Suekawa, President of Ritsumeikan University, and Kazue Nawa, Professor of Osaka City University.

After the meeting, they issued a statement expressing their determination to work with people from all other sectors of the country to do everything possible to prevent the Japanese Diet from ratifying the new Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty.

Eleven representatives, including Nawa, will travel to Tokyo on the 19th to submit a petition to the Diet opposing the treaty.

    日本文化界人士要岸信介下台
    中岛健藏说日本人民不能再承认岸信介卖国政府
    据新华社17日讯　东京消息：大约六百位日本文化界领袖今天参加了“安全条约批判会”举行的大会，表示强烈反对新日美“安全条约”，坚决要求岸信介政府下台。
    他们在会后举行了示威，到国会去递交请愿书，要求国会通过不信任岸信介政府的决议。
    在大会上，作家、评论家、学者、舞台演员和宗教界人士的代表一个一个地走上讲台发言，都表示为了阻止批准新“安全条约”和推翻岸信介政府而斗争的决心。
    中岛健藏说：“不听日本人民的呼声而卑贱地服从美国指示的岸信介政府，再也不能被认为是日本政府。”一位代表女青年会讲话的妇女说：“女青年会已经征集了一万多个反对安全条约的签名，这些签名已经交给国会。今天我们将带着在这以后征集的一千二百五十多个签名到国会去。”
    一位佛教徒代表愤恨地说：“岸信介现在由于过分地贪求权力而瞎了眼。”他说：“我们不能把我们的政治交给疯子来管。”
    接着，女演员山本安英宣读了俳优座和前进座等三十四个剧团发表的声明。声明强调说，日本的男女演员不能容忍国会通过新的日美“安全条约”，因为新条约是针对中国的，而日本还没有为它的侵略罪行对中国谢罪。
    大会参加者一致通过要求废除新日美“安全条约”和岸信介政府辞职的决议。
    会后，他们举行了游行示威。当他们向国会行进的时候，游行者唱石川达三作词的“给亚洲以和平”的歌曲，佛教徒们打着鼓。
    社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎在国会接受了他们的请愿书。他向请愿者发表讲话说，自由民主党在国会所占的多数议席，同人民的多数意见是不符合的。浅沼强调说：“因此，国会应当立即解散。”
    请愿者然后到首相官邸，要求见岸信介本人。他们在首相官邸前面举行静坐示威，最后他们得到了这个诺言：岸信介将在明天会见“安全条约批判会”的十一名代表。
    新华社17日讯　东京消息：大阪市关西区大约四十名大学教授和其他文化界知名人士16日晚上举行集会，表示反对新日美“安全条约”。
    这些人中间有立命馆大学校长末川博、大阪市立大学教授名和统一等。
    他们在会后发表声明，表示坚决同全国其他阶层的人民一道竭尽全力阻止日本国会批准新日美军事同盟条约。
    包括名和在内的十一位代表将在19日前往东京，向国会提出反对这项条约的请愿书。
