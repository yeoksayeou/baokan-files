    Expedition to the Desert Wilderness
    Our Correspondent in Xinjiang
    The fertile wasteland of Hotan County at the foot of the Kunlun Mountains is mostly scattered along the banks of the lower reaches of the Yurungkash River. For many years, Uyghur farmers have dreamed of establishing new pastoral lands and villages there... Since this spring, relying on the strength of the commune, they have reclaimed 250,000 mu of wasteland in one go, equivalent to more than 60% of the county's original cultivated land.

    The car drove towards the lower reaches of the Yurungkash River and quickly passed through an oasis fragrant with peach and plum blossoms. The continuous sand dunes in front of us squeezed the river valley into a narrow line. It was hard to imagine what the wasteland we were going to was like.

    Along the way, pedestrians, donkey carts, and large carts came one after another. The four-horse carriages were full of seeds and farm implements, wooden beds, bedding, and chickens and ducks, carrying the songs of Uyghur young men and women, flowing forward like water...

    The fertile wasteland of Hotan County at the foot of the Kunlun Mountains is mostly scattered along the banks of the lower reaches of the Yurungkash River, one or two hundred li away from the Hotan oasis, separated by the distant desert. For many years, Uyghur farmers have dreamed of establishing new pastoral lands and villages there, but it was not until this spring, with the further consolidation of the people's communes, that the seven people's communes in Hotan County were able to send more than 19,000 labor troops on a long-distance expedition to reclaim wasteland. In just a few months, more than 250,000 mu of wasteland have been reclaimed, and the county's cultivated land has been expanded by more than 60% in one go.

    The wasteland we were going to was located on the east bank of the Yurungkash River and was reclaimed by the Red Flag People's Commune. It is said that in the past, it was overgrown with thorns and weeds, and wild sheep, wild boars, and wild rabbits roamed all year round, the scenery was very desolate. But where we have now arrived, we can only see more than 20 square kilometers, which has been transformed into neat and uniform grid fields. The newly built branch canals, bucket canals, and farm canals interweave these neat fields, stretching all the way to the edge of the desert. Hundreds and thousands of young men and women are working enthusiastically, reclaiming wasteland, sowing seeds, and building houses. They sang happily: "Our wasteland is as beautiful as spring; our labor is for the sake of future generations. In the era of Mao Zedong, life is getting better and better. We want to build communism on the wasteland!..."

    Like all communes in Hotan County, the Red Flag Commune, in addition to reclaiming wasteland and building fields, is also engaged in animal husbandry, forestry, fishery, horticulture, and developing sideline occupations on the wasteland. Schools, nurseries, clubs... have already been built here.

    The Red Flag Commune only announced the wasteland reclamation plan to its members in mid-January this year. As soon as the plan was announced, two-thirds of the labor force signed up to participate, more than twice the actual need. They put forward the slogan: "Complete the annual task in one season." The vast majority of the first batch of more than 3,600 wasteland reclaimers were away from home for the first time. They carried their luggage on their backs and walked for two days before reaching the reclamation area. Before they left, their parents and wives repeatedly told them to reclaim and plant the wasteland well, and then bring their families to the reclamation area.

    Everything is hard at the beginning. The difficulty was not the wind, snow, and severe cold, because before they arrived, the commune's advance team had already built three or four hundred thatched huts and dugout shelters to shelter from the wind and snow; the difficulty was not the food problem, because the commune's canteen had already moved with the reclamation workers. The most difficult thing was the lack of wasteland surveying and design personnel, the lack of scientific instruments, and the lack of large-scale machinery and farm implements for wasteland reclamation, but people overcame all difficulties with their own brains and hands. They made their own soil levels and trained their own wasteland surveying technicians; lacking carrying poles and baskets, they used the red willow strips on the wasteland to weave carrying poles and baskets; not enough rope, they peeled wild hemp and twisted rope; without large-scale machinery and farm implements, they used earth clods to reclaim wasteland; the wild grass and thorns were thick and dense, and the earth clods could not be dug in, so they changed to using axes to chop, and finally increased the wasteland reclamation per person per day from more than two cents of land to five cents of land. In just over a month, they reclaimed more than 32,000 mu of wasteland, completing 80% of the annual plan, and received awards from the CCP Hotan County Committee.

    Maimaitiyimou, deputy secretary of the Red Flag Commune Party Committee, introduced us to this year's wasteland planting plan: 16,000 mu of corn, 4,000 mu of alfalfa, 3,000 mu of rice, 2,000 mu of hemp, 1,500 mu of cantaloupe, as well as green beans, sorghum, and oil crops. Because they started early, all the wasteland will be sown and harvested in the same year. He said: At present, most of the newly reclaimed land has been leveled, and the canal project has been basically completed, and all that remains is to divert snow water to irrigate the fields when the ice and snow melt on the Kunlun Mountains in the summer.

    "We also want to turn the wasteland into a more beautiful place than the Hotan oasis!" Many farmers told us with confidence. We visited the early spring crops that were sprouting neatly, visited the newly opened orchards and the future settlements, the settlements were already surrounded by square fences made of red willow strips, and tall arches were built at the entrances and exits of the fences. They burned wasteland grass into bricks and built houses.

    "Our people's communes in Hotan County also want to open up the wasteland leading to the Aksu oasis!" Abularouzi, deputy captain of the Second Brigade of the Tangbake Management Area of the Red Flag Commune, told us about the vision of changing the desert. He said: It takes thirteen days to walk from the Hotan oasis across the Taklamakan Desert to the Aksu oasis. This year, we have penetrated one or two hundred li into the desert. It seems that it will take a few more years to open it up. With such enthusiastic and energetic people, what reason is there not to believe that such a plan can be completed?

    远征沙荒
    本报驻新疆记者
    昆仑山下和田县肥沃的荒地，大部散布在玉龙喀什河下游两岸；多少年来，维吾尔族农民就梦想在那里建立新的田园和村庄……。今春以来，人们依靠公社的力量，一气开垦了二十五万亩荒地，相当全县原有耕地的60％以上。
    汽车驶向玉龙喀什河的下游，很快穿过了桃李芬芳的绿洲，眼前连绵不绝的沙丘，把河谷逼成窄窄的一线。简直想像不出我们要去的荒地是什么样子。
    沿途步行的、赶毛驴的、赶大车的人络绎不绝。那四套马车上面满载着籽种和农具，载着木床、被褥和鸡鸭，载着维吾尔族青年男女的歌声，流水一般向前赶去……。
    昆仑山下和田县肥沃的荒地大都散布在玉龙喀什河下游两岸，离和田绿洲一两百华里，中间是沙漠远阻重隔。多少年来，维吾尔族农民就梦想着在那里建立起新的田园和村庄，但直到今年春天，随着人民公社进一步巩固，和田县七个人民公社才有可能派出一万九千多名劳动大军远征开荒，短短几个月内，已开垦出了二十五万多亩荒地，全县耕地一气扩大了60％以上。
    我们要去的荒地位于玉龙喀什河东岸，是红旗人民公社开垦出来的。听说过去那里荆棘野草丛生，终年出没着野羊、野猪和野兔，景况十分荒凉。但是我们现在所到之处，只见纵横二十多平方公里，已经变成了整齐划一的格子田，新修的支渠、斗渠、农渠把这些整齐的田畦交织在一起，一直伸向沙漠的边缘。成百上千的青年男女在热情的劳动着，开荒的开荒，播种的播种，盖房的盖房。他们愉快地唱道：“我们的荒地，春天一样美丽；我们的劳动，为了子孙万代。在毛泽东的时代，生活越过越美。我们要在荒地上，建设共产主义！……。”
    像和田县所有公社一样，红旗公社除了开荒造田外，他们还在荒地上经营着畜牧业、林业、渔业、园艺，发展副业。这里已经建成了学校、托儿所、俱乐部……。
    红旗公社是今年1月中旬才向社员宣布开荒规划的。规划一宣布，当时就有三分之二的劳动力报名参加，超过了实际需要的两倍多。他们提出口号：“全年任务，一季完成”。第一批三千六百多名开荒者，绝大多数人是第一次远离家门，他们自己背上行李步行两天才赶到垦区；临别时，父母、妻子一再叮咛要把荒地开好种好，然后把家接到垦区去。
    万事开头难。这困难不是风雪严寒，因为在他们到达之前，公社先遣队已经修好了三四百间遮风避雪的茅屋和地窝子；这困难不是吃饭问题，因为公社食堂已经随垦荒者一起搬来了。最困难的是缺乏荒地勘测设计人员，缺乏科学仪器，缺乏开荒的大型机械和农具，但是人们用自己的脑和手战胜了一切困难。他们自造土水平仪，培养自己的荒地勘测技术人员；缺乏抬把挑筐，就用荒地上的红柳条编抬把、编挑筐；套绳不够，他们剥野麻，拧套绳；没有大型机械农具，他们就用砍土墁开荒；荒草荆棘又厚又密，砍土墁挖不进去，就改用斧头砍，终于使每人每天开荒从两分多地提高到五分地。短短一个多月，他们就开了三万二千多亩荒地，完成全年计划的80％，受到了中共和田县委的奖励。
    红旗公社党委副书记买买提伊亩向我们介绍了今年荒地播种计划：玉米一万六千亩，苜蓿四千亩，水稻三千亩，大麻二千亩，哈密瓜一千五百亩，此外还有绿豆、高粱和油料等作物。由于动手早，全部荒地当年播种，当年收获。他说：目前新垦土地大都平整就绪，渠道工程已基本竣工，只待夏天昆仑山上冰雪融化，就可以引雪水灌田了。
    “我们还要把荒地变成比和田绿洲更美丽的地方！”不少农民充满信心地对我们说。我们参观了出苗整齐的早春作物，参观了新辟的果园和未来的定居点，那定居点的四周已经用红柳林条围起了四四方方的篱笆，篱笆进出口修起了高大的拱门。他们用荒草烧成了砖，盖成了房。
    “我们和田县各人民公社还要打通通往阿克苏绿洲的荒地！”红旗公社唐巴克管理区第二大队副队长阿不拉肉孜向我们叙述了改变沙漠的远景。他说：和田绿洲横穿塔里木大沙漠到阿克苏绿洲步行需要十三天路程，今年我们已深入沙漠一两百华里，看来再有几年就可以打通了。有这样一些充满热情、干劲十足的人，完成这样的计划有什么理由不相信呢？
