In his early years, Comrade Lin Boqu participated in the Tongmenghui led by Sun Yat-sen. He joined the Communist Party of China in 1921.

After Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the revolution, he participated in the Nanchang Uprising on August 1, 1927. He served as the Minister of National Economy and Minister of Finance of the Central Government of the Workers' and Peasants' Democratic Republic in the Jiangxi Revolutionary Base Area.
