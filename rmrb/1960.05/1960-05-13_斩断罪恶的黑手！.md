Sever the Sinister Hand of Evil!
\tBy Our Commentator

On May 9, President Touré of the Republic of Guinea announced that the Guinean government had uncovered another subversion case plotted by imperialists. As you may recall, President Touré announced on April 21 the uncovering of another subversion conspiracy plotted by imperialists, aimed at inciting armed rebellion to overthrow the young republic's government. The Chinese people congratulate the people of Guinea on their victory in defending their national independence and security, and resolutely support the Guinean people's struggle against imperialist subversion.

Within a month, two imperialist subversion cases have occurred in Guinea, proving how much the imperialists hate the African people's achievement of true independence. From the very first day of the Republic of Guinea's establishment, French imperialists have conspired to strangle it, and have recently plotted despicable subversion conspiracies. In this sinister conspiracy of the French imperialists, the US imperialists are the main accomplices. Among the weapons seized from the rebels recently exhibited in Conakry, the capital of Guinea, were twenty-one cases of US-made grenades and incendiary bombs, bearing the mark of the "US Ordnance Department." These facts tell people that US imperialism and French imperialism are both mortal enemies of the Guinean people.

Despite the imperialists' resolute hostility towards the Republic of Guinea, the united and independent Guinean people have the power to crush all imperialist conspiracies to harm this newborn republic of Black Africa. The government of the Republic of Guinea has taken decisive measures against the anti-republican rebels, sentencing them to severe punishments, which is entirely just and correct. If imperialism dares to extend its sinister hand, it must be resolutely severed!

    斩断罪恶的黑手！
    本报评论员
    几内亚共和国总统杜尔在5月9日宣布，几内亚政府又破获了一宗由帝国主义者所策划的颠复案件。大家记得，杜尔总统在4月21日曾经宣布破获另一宗由帝国主义者策动的、目的在于煽起武装叛乱来推翻这个年青的共和国政府的颠复阴谋。中国人民对几内亚人民在保卫祖国独立和安全的事业中所取得的胜利表示祝贺，并坚决支持几内亚人民反对帝国主义颠复活动的斗争。
    在不到一个月时间内，几内亚连续发生了两起帝国主义颠复案，这证明了帝国主义是如何痛恨非洲人民取得真正的独立。法国帝国主义者从几内亚共和国成立的第一天起，就阴谋扼杀它；最近连续策划了可耻的颠复阴谋。在法国帝国主义者的这个罪恶阴谋中，美帝国主义者是主要的帮凶。最近在几内亚首都科纳克里展出的从叛乱分子缴获的武器中，就有二十一箱美国制造的手榴弹和燃烧弹，在这些武器上有着“美国军械处”的标志。这些事实告诉人们美帝国主义和法帝国主义，同样是几内亚人民的死敌。
    尽管帝国主义者坚决敌视几内亚共和国，但是，团结一致的、已经取得了独立的几内亚人民，有力量粉碎帝国主义危害这个黑非洲新生共和国的一切阴谋。几内亚共和国政府已经对反共和国的叛乱分子采取了果断措施，判处他们以重刑，这是完全正义的和正确的。帝国主义只要敢于把黑手伸进来，就必须坚决地斩断它！
