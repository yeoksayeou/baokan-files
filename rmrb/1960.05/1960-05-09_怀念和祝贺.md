    Remembrance and Congratulations
    Liu Zizhang, Director of Beijing Film Developing and Printing Factory
    Our Beijing Film Developing and Printing Factory—a flower of Sino-Czech friendship—has developed and printed nearly 50 million meters of film since it was completed and put into production four months ahead of schedule in September 1958. If calculated based on the output in March of this year, the annual output could reach or even exceed 60 million meters, exceeding the original designed production capacity by more than 50%.
    Whenever we achieve new production successes, we naturally think of the selfless labor of Czechoslovak experts in our factory from construction and installation to trial production. We often remember and happily talk about the proletarian internationalism and excellent work style of the experts. For example, Comrade Smantor, an electrical expert, never let go of any shortcomings in the complicated wiring. He said, "This factory is not for one or two years, but for fifty or a hundred years. Quality first." Comrade Holacek, an optical expert, not only had strict requirements for quality, but also paid attention to economy. He thought of many ways to use the cheapest substitutes without affecting the quality. Comrade Pusbulamski, a ventilation expert, was widely praised for his serious, conscientious, and enthusiastic working attitude. He often worked hard all day and still drafted operating procedures for the trial production of our factory in the evening; sometimes, he even continued to work on the air ducts while ill. During the installation of the air ducts, he worked hard with the Chinese workers, drilling into the small air ducts to check the quality and personally handling the water leakage problem of the washing tank.
    When dealing with an installation project or a process problem, Czechoslovak experts often put forward several different plans, study them with Chinese experts, and choose the best plan that best suits China's situation. What is moving is that they never held back anything when imparting technology to Chinese comrades. They not only left us the technical data they had accumulated personally, but also collected and sent us many materials after returning to their country.
    Czechoslovak experts expressed great concern and praise for China's Great Leap Forward. They did their best to help realize the unconventional suggestions put forward by Chinese technicians. For example, Dr. Kolian, a process expert and chief engineer of the Prague Film Developing and Printing Factory, gave many ideas to the suggestion made by Chinese comrades to change the 16mm printer to a 32mm printer (this modification can double the output), which played a good role in promoting the rapid success of this reform.
    In this way, during the construction of the factory, Czechoslovak experts and Chinese experts, technicians, and workers established a deep friendship.
    We have not seen the Czechoslovak experts for more than a year or even two years, but their appearance always lingers in our minds, making us miss them very much. On the occasion of the 15th anniversary of the liberation of Czechoslovakia, let us extend our heartfelt and warm congratulations to all the Czechoslovak experts who have worked in our factory and to our Czechoslovak friends, and at the same time pay them our high respect and gratitude.

    怀念和祝贺
    北京电影洗印厂厂长　刘子章
    我们北京电影洗印厂——中捷友谊之花，自从1958年9月提前四个月建成并投入生产到现在，已经洗印了将近五千万米电影影片。如果以今年3月份的产量推算，年产量就可以达到以至超过六千万米，即超过原设计生产能力的50％以上。
    每当我们获得了新的生产成就时，我们都很自然地想到捷克斯洛伐克专家在我厂从土建、安装到试生产当中的忘我劳动。我们时常记起并高兴地谈论着专家们的无产阶级国际主义精神和优良作风。如电气专家史曼铎同志对复杂的布线中所发生的任何缺点从不放过，他说：“这个厂不是使用一年、两年，而是要使用五十年、一百年，质量第一。”光学专家荷拉切克同志不仅对质量要求严格，同时还很注意节约，他想了很多办法，利用不影响质量但是最便宜的代用品。通风专家普斯布拉姆斯基同志的严肃认真而热情的工作态度，更是大家交口称赞的。他常常在白天紧张地工作了一整天之后，还在晚上为我厂试生产草拟操作规程；有时还带病继续在风管上坚持工作。在安装风管道时，他同中国工人一道苦干，钻到小风筒去检查质量，亲自动手处理水洗箱的漏水问题。
    捷克斯洛伐克专家对处理一项安装工程或是一项工艺问题，常常提出几个不同的方案，同中国专家一道研究，选择最好、最适合中国情况的方案。令人感动的是：他们在传授技术上对中国同志从不保留什么。不仅个人积累的技术资料留给我们，而且回国之后，还替我们搜集了许多资料寄来。
    捷克斯洛伐克专家对我国的大跃进表示了很大的关怀和赞扬。他们对我国技术人员所提出的打破常规的建议，都是尽力帮助实现。例如对中国同志提出把十六毫米印片机改为能够印三十二毫米的印片机的建议（这一改装可以提高产量一倍），工艺专家、布拉格洗印厂总工程师柯连博士就给出了很多主意，对促使这一改革很快取得成功，起了很好的作用。
    这样，在建厂中间，捷克斯洛伐克专家和中国的专家、技术人员和工人建立了深厚的友谊。
    我们和捷克斯洛伐克专家已经一年多甚至两年多没有见面了，但他们的风貌始终盘旋在我们的脑海里，使我们怀念不已。值此捷克斯洛伐克解放十五周年之际，让我们向所有在我厂工作过的捷克斯洛伐克专家以及我们的捷克斯洛伐克朋友致衷心热烈的祝贺，同时向他们致以崇高的敬意和感谢之忱。
