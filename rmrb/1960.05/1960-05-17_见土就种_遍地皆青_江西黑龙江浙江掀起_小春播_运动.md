Xinhua News Agency report: Jiangxi is adopting five methods – "reclaim, transform, change, yield, interplant" – to ensure the expansion of early rice planting area, while simultaneously expanding the planting area of cash crops and dryland miscellaneous grains. Currently, the province has planted over 3.9 million mu of cotton, flax, tobacco, tea, sugarcane, medicinal herbs, and fruit trees, an increase of more than 1.1 million mu compared to last year; the planting area of miscellaneous grain crops such as sorghum, corn, millet, and taro has reached over 1 million mu, an eightfold increase compared to last year. In areas where planting began earlier, field management has already started; areas that have not yet finished planting are racing against time to continue the "plant whenever there is soil, use every piece of land" expansion campaign.

The "reclaim, transform, change, yield, interplant" methods were proposed by local Party committees based on their specific local conditions. "Reclaim" refers to reclaiming wasteland and barren hills; "transform" refers to changing dry land into paddy fields; "change" refers to turning small hills into large hills, and scattered land into large plots; "yield" refers to moving miscellaneous grains and dry crops uphill to make way for rice, and ensuring that vegetable and fodder land do not encroach on grain fields; "interplant" refers to intercropping various dryland crops. In Ruijin County, thanks to the active reclamation of wasteland and barren hills, and the adoption of ten types of dryland crops such as sorghum and corn moving uphill, the area for miscellaneous grains expanded by more than 60,000 mu compared to last year, while simultaneously expanding early rice. Gao'an County expanded the early rice area by 30,000 mu by turning small hills into large hills and reclaiming wasteland to expand the planting of dryland crops; the area for tobacco, early soybeans, and mulberry trees also increased by more than 100,000 mu. In Jinxian, Xinfeng, and other counties, soybeans are interplanted between rows of wheat, sesame is interplanted in sweet potato fields, corn is interplanted in peanut fields, and sweet potatoes are interplanted between rows of cotton, expanding the planting area by more than 120,000 mu.

During the expansion campaign, various localities also fully utilized all kinds of idle land such as roadsides and ditch sides, with the province planting over 4.3 million mu of pumpkins and vegetables on idle land.

To achieve "plant one seedling, ensure one seedling, harvest one plant" and achieve multiple harvests with high yields, various localities have promptly launched field management campaigns centered on ensuring full and strong seedlings after the expansion of planting. In the Gannan area, communes dispatched members to form specialized teams to manage miscellaneous grain crops, and the 450,000 mu of miscellaneous grain crops in the entire area have generally undergone topdressing, soil cultivation, seedling inspection, and seedling replenishment. Thanks to early and good management, the new sugarcane seedlings in Nankang County, covering more than 32,000 mu, are now about three feet tall. In Pengze County, communes organized the masses to carry out seedling protection campaigns immediately after cotton sowing. The 95,000 mu of cotton in the county are showing vibrant green and growing well overall.

Xinhua News Agency report: Counties in Heilongjiang Province that have finished sowing on existing cultivated land have launched a "small spring plowing" campaign. So far, Bin County alone has reclaimed wasteland and utilized idle land gaps totaling 100,000 mu, accounting for 40% of the "small spring plowing" plan, of which 80,000 mu have been planted with soybeans, corn, and other crops. Hailun County has also reclaimed large areas of wasteland and utilized idle land gaps totaling more than 70,000 mu, half of which have been sown with seeds.

During the "small spring plowing" campaign, various localities generally conducted surveys of wasteland and usable idle land gaps and formed specialized teams to cultivate them. People's communes in Bin County conducted thorough surveys of wasteland, hillsides, plots, ditches, and households in management areas. The county identified a total of 190,000 mu of large and small wasteland areas suitable for reclamation and more than 39,000 mu of closed unnecessary roads, field edges, pond embankments, and usable gaps along ditches and in front of and behind houses. In total, the county can expand the cultivated land area by more than 250,000 mu, accounting for 30% of the existing cultivated land area. People's communes across the county mobilized over 45,000 strong laborers, 22 tractors, 3,200 double-wheeled double-share plows and single-share plows, and organized more than 1,600 specialized teams to rush to the wasteland and gap sites for plowing and planting. In Hailun County, the 220,000-strong spring plowing army was divided into inland and expeditionary routes, launching fierce attacks on wasteland and idle land gaps. According to Hailun County's plan, 375,000 mu of wasteland will be reclaimed and 50,000 mu of idle land gaps will be utilized before summer hoeing, accounting for 9.6% of the county's existing cultivated land area. The people's communes selected 52,000 strong laborers to form expeditionary teams and entered large areas of wasteland to begin reclamation. The 170,000 male and female commune members remaining in the communes, also adhering to the spirit of "every inch of land must be cultivated, making use of every gap," reclaimed and planted wasteland along field edges, roadsides, ditch sides, embankment edges, and gaps in forests.

Xinhua News Agency report: Various localities in Zhejiang Province are seizing the current favorable opportunity to fully utilize all idle land to plant oil crops such as castor beans and sunflowers. Wenzhou Prefecture launched an oil crop planting blitz week, and has currently planted more than 100,000 mu of castor beans. Aojiang Commune in Pingyang County mobilized members to blitz for one day, reclaiming 268 mu of idle land and wasteland, planting more than 500 jin of castor bean seeds in large areas. Mountainous and semi-mountainous areas in Jinhua, Ningbo, and other prefectures are also launching oil crop expansion blitzes. Jiande County adopted a combination of large-scale oil crops and small-scale oil crops, combining planned planting by each commune with the utilization of gaps by various government agencies, schools, factories, mines, and enterprises to plant oil crops on a large scale. The county has expanded the planting of oil tea and tung oil trees by more than 215,000 mu and sunflowers and castor beans by more than 800,000 plants.

Communist Youth League organizations in various localities have fully mobilized young people to plant oil crops on a large scale. Communist Youth League organizations in communes in Ningbo City mobilized young people to take action and plant oil crops on a large scale. Young people throughout the city have planted 9.2 million castor bean and sunflower plants. Young people in Shaoxing County put forward the resounding slogan "Turn idle land into treasure land, increase oil crop production for the motherland." The county organized 2,660 blitz teams (groups) to plant more than 12 million oil crop plants along houses, roads, ditches, rivers, and field edges and gravesides.

    见土就种　遍地皆青
    江西黑龙江浙江掀起“小春播”运动
    据新华社讯　江西各地采取“垦、改、变、让、套”五种办法，在保证扩大早稻种植面积的同时，扩大了经济作物和旱地杂粮作物的播种面积。现在，全省已种棉、麻、烟、茶、甘蔗、药材和果树等三百九十多万亩，比去年多种了一百一十多万亩；高粱、玉米、谷子、芋头等杂粮作物播种面积已达一百多万亩，比去年扩大了八倍。播种早的地区，已及时转入田间管理；还未结束播种的地区，正争分夺秒，继续开展“见土就用，有土就种”的扩种运动。
    “垦、改、变、让、套”的办法，是各地党委根据当地具体条件提出的。“垦”是开垦荒地、荒山；“改”是旱地改水田；“变”是小丘变大丘，零星地变为大块地；“让”是杂粮、旱作物上山，给水稻让地，蔬菜、饲料地不占粮田；“套”是在各种旱地作物中实行间种套种。瑞金县各公社由于积极开垦荒地、荒山和采取了高粱、玉米等十种旱地作物上山的办法，在早稻扩大的同时，杂粮作物的面积比去年扩大了六万多亩。高安县采取了小丘变大丘和开垦荒地扩种旱地作物等办法，早稻面积扩大了三万亩，烟叶、早大豆、桑树等作物也增加了十万多亩。进贤、信丰等县在小麦行间套种大豆，红薯地里套种芝麻，花生地里套种玉米，棉花行里套红薯，扩大播种面积达十二万多亩。
    各地在扩种运动中，还充分利用路边、渠旁等各种闲散地，全省在闲散土地上种植的南瓜、蔬菜达四百三十多万亩。
    为了做到“种一株、保一株、收一株”，实现多种高产多收，各地在扩种以后，都及时开展了以保证苗全苗壮为中心的田间管理运动。赣南地区各公社抽调社员组成专业队，专管杂粮作物，全区四十五万亩杂粮作物，已普遍进行了追肥、培土和查苗、补苗。南康县三万二千多亩新植蔗，由于管得早管得好，现在蔗苗已高达三尺左右。彭泽县各公社在棉花播种后，即组织群众开展了保苗运动，全县九万五千多亩棉花一片新绿，生长普遍良好。
    本报讯　黑龙江省已经结束现有耕地播种的县份，又展开了一个“小春耕”运动。到目前止，仅宾县就已开荒和利用闲田隙地十万亩，占“小春耕”计划的40％，其中有八万亩种上了大豆、苞米和其他作物；海伦县也开垦出大片荒地和利用闲田隙地七万多亩，已有一半播上了种子。
    各地在“小春耕”运动中，普遍进行了查荒原和可以利用的闲田隙地，并组成专业队来耕种。宾县各人民公社以管理区为单位，逐山、逐坡、逐地块、逐沟、逐户地清查荒原，全县共查出可垦的大片和小片荒地十九万亩，可以封闭的不必要的道路、地边、池埂和可以利用的沟边、房前房后等空隙地三万九千多亩。全县共计可以扩大耕地面积二十五万多亩，占现有耕地面积的30％。全县各人民公社抽调四万五千多个强壮劳动力、二十二台拖拉机、三千二百台双轮双铧犁和单铧犁等，组织了一千六百多个专业队，纷纷奔赴荒地和隙地现场抢耕抢种。海伦县全县二十二万春耕劳动大军，分内地和远征两路，向荒原和闲田隙地猛攻；按海伦全县规划，夏锄前垦荒三十七万五千亩，利用闲田隙地五万亩，共占全县现有耕地面积的9.6％。各人民公社选拔了五万二千个壮劳动力，组成了远征队，先后进入大片荒地开始了垦荒。留在社内的十七万男女社员，也本着“寸土必耕，见缝插针”的精神，在地头、道边、沟边、坞沿、林中隙地等闲田隙地里开荒播种。
    据新华社讯　浙江省各地抓住当前有利时机，充分利用一切空闲地种植蓖麻、向日葵等油料作物。温州专区开展种植油料突击周，目前已种蓖麻十万多亩。平阳县鳌江公社发动社员突击一天，就开垦了空闲地和荒地二百六十八亩，成片种下蓖麻籽五百多斤。金华、宁波等专区的山区半山区也在突击扩种油料。建德县采取大宗油料与小宗油料相结合，各公社按计划种植与各机关、学校、厂矿、企业利用空隙地相结合的方法大种油料，全县已扩种油茶、油桐二十一万五千多亩，向日葵、蓖麻八十多万株。
    各地共青团组织充分发动广大青少年大量种植油料作物。宁波市各公社共青团组织发动青少年人人动手，大种油料，全市青少年已种植了蓖麻、向日葵九百二十万株。绍兴县青少年提出“叫闲地变宝地，为祖国增产油料”的响亮口号，全县组织了二千六百六十个突击队（组）在宅旁、道旁、渠旁、河旁和地头、坟头种下了油料作物一千二百多万株。
