    Why Bother?
    The "New York Herald Tribune" revealed on May 11 that "due to the great failure of spy pilot Powers' flight over Russia on May 1, the CIA will dismiss a number of people."
    Why did the shooting down of an American plane suddenly prompt the US Central Intelligence Agency to decide to dismiss a group of its spies? It turns out that Powers did not comply with the "strict rules that all spies should abide by": "Destroy all evidence of his activities, and if necessary, destroy himself." The result was that "both the person and the evidence were captured," completely exposing American espionage activities. Therefore, the CIA authorities felt it necessary to purge their subordinates, entrusting "tasks that might involve national prestige only to those who would carry out instructions at any cost."
    Powers, employed by the CIA, not only failed to complete his mission but also failed to destroy the evidence. He not only failed to end his life with the poison pin but also confessed, making Washington look utterly foolish. No wonder the CIA chiefs are annoyed.
    However, since Eisenhower has already announced that collecting intelligence on the Soviet Union and other countries is US national policy, and openly admits that the United States will continue to carry out this kind of activity; since the US government has openly stated that it is not ashamed of engaging in espionage against other countries, then why should Allen Dulles make things difficult for his underlings by forcing them to make the "great ambition to die for inhumanity and sacrifice oneself for injustice" in order to cover up the crimes?

### 何必多此一举

    何必多此一举
    美国“纽约先驱论坛报”5月11日透露，“由于间谍飞行员鲍尔士5月1日在俄国上空飞行的大失败，中央情报局将解雇一批人。”
    美国飞机的被击落为什么竟促使美国的中央谍报机构突然决定要辞退它的一批间谍人员呢？原来是因为鲍尔士没有遵守“所有间谍人员应遵守的严格规则”：“销毁他干这种活动的一切证据，必要时毁灭自己”，结果是“人赃并获”，使美国的间谍活动完全败露。因此中央情报局的当局认为有必要对它的手下人员来一次清洗，把“可能涉及到国家威望的任务只交给不惜以任何代价执行指示的人。”
    受雇于中央情报局的鲍尔士不但没有完成任务，而且又没有消灭罪证，不但没有用那带毒药的别针结束自己的生命，还作了口供，使得华盛顿当局出尽了丑，这就难怪中央情报局的头目们恼火了。
    但是，既然艾森豪威尔已经宣布，对苏联和其他国家搜集情报是美国的国策，而且毫不掩饰美国将要继续进行这种活动；美国政府已经公开表明不以对其他国家进行间谍为耻，那末艾伦·杜勒斯又何必为了要掩藏罪迹而难为他手下的小喽罗，非要他们立下“杀身成不仁，舍身取不义”的大志不可呢？
