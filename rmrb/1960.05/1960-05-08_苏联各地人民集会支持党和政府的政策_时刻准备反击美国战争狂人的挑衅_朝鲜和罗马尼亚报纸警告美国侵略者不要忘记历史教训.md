Xinhua News Agency, 7th May. (TASS, 6th May) In cities and rural areas across the Soviet Union, mass meetings, rallies, and symposiums have been held in industrial enterprises, collective farms, organizations, and schools in recent days to discuss the report made by Chairman Khrushchev of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union at the session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.

Resolutions were passed at gatherings in various places, expressing full approval of the measures taken by the Communist Party and government of the Soviet Union aimed at raising the living standards of the people, and unanimously supporting the Soviet government's foreign policy of easing international tensions. In these resolutions, the working people expressed their indignation at the provocative behavior of the American warmongers against the Soviet Union. They believe that the United States is carrying out such provocations on the eve of the summit conference in an attempt to sow distrust among the people of all countries and undermine the consolidation of peace.

Abdullayev, a worker at the Tashkent Diesel Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Plant, said at a mass meeting at the plant: "Our response to the Party and government's concern for the welfare of the people is that we will work with greater enthusiasm." He said, "We know that our achievements inspire all good people in the world. But we must not forget that these achievements make the advocates of the 'cold war' uneasy. The workers in our factory were very happy to hear the news that the enemy plane that invaded Soviet airspace was shot down." He emphasized that anyone who dares to disrupt the peaceful labor of the Soviet people will suffer the same fate.

Chiaduneli, the captain of the "Communist Labor Team" at the Tbilisi Electrical Machinery Plant, said that the interests of our Party always coincide with the interests of all the Soviet people.

Spirin, a construction worker from Novosibirsk, recalled a conversation he had with U.S. Vice President Nixon during his visit to the Soviet Union last year. Nixon then promised to answer his question later: what have the American leaders done to permanently eliminate the threat of war. Spirin said that Mr. Nixon's answer was the piratical flight of American planes.

Spirin said that Khrushchev is right a thousand times over because he speaks for all the people – whoever attacks us with swords and guns will surely die by swords and guns. We will never let our enemies go.

Sergeant Rubtsov said that our strength and power support Khrushchev's just warning to the instigators of war. He emphasized: "We should be ready at all times from now on."

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 7th May. "Democratic Korea" published an editorial on the 7th, warmly welcoming the report made by Khrushchev at the session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, and warning the American aggressors not to forget the lessons of history.

The editorial said: "The Soviet Union's measure to abolish taxes for workers and staff concentrates demonstrates the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system, in which the tax burden on the working people is increasing." This measure is another great achievement made by the Soviet people in building communism.

The editorial said: "Since the Second World War, the Soviet Union and the entire socialist countries have been making unremitting efforts to implement the Potsdam Agreement, to prevent new sources of war from arising in Europe and Asia, and to defend world peace. However, American imperialism has revived German militarism in West Germany and Japanese imperialism in the East in order to use them as shock troops for a new war of aggression against the socialist camp; today, West Germany and Japan have become the most dangerous new sources of war."

The editorial emphasized that the American imperialist war policy and the military blocs it organizes and the military bases it establishes around the world are the main reasons that are seriously threatening peace and security and aggravating international tensions today. The editorial said: We must solemnly warn the American imperialist aggressors not to forget the historical lessons of the Second World War.

The editorial emphasized: The American imperialists and their followers must be stopped immediately from provoking new plots of aggression, the American aggressor troops must be withdrawn from South Korea and the Asian region without delay, the aggressive military blocs such as the U.S.-Japan military alliance must be abolished, and the American military bases must be removed.

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, 7th May. The Romanian newspaper "Scinteia" published an article on the 7th, welcoming the report made by Khrushchev at the session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.

The article described the brilliant achievements made by the Soviet Union in creating a happy life for the people.

The article then pointed out that it is very important that Khrushchev clearly put forward the Soviet Union's foreign policy in his report on the eve of the summit conference. The article said that while the Soviet Union is actively creating a favorable atmosphere for the summit conference, the other participating countries have not yet expressed their genuine willingness to seek acceptable and concrete solutions. The statements made by Nixon, Herter, Dillon, and others regarding the summit conference, as well as the resolution recently passed by the U.S. House of Representatives that runs counter to peaceful coexistence, are fundamentally out of step with the spirit of the times.

The article pointed out that what is more serious is that American planes have twice violated Soviet airspace in recent weeks. This is a provocative act, and it is particularly serious because it occurred before the summit conference.

The article added that it would be a dream if anyone thought that they could obtain some unilateral concessions from the Soviet Union through talks. Continuing to strengthen the socialist camp and vigorously launching the struggle for peace throughout the world will guarantee that those who create tensions will suffer new defeats.

### 苏联各地人民集会支持党和政府的政策  时刻准备反击美国战争狂人的挑衅  朝鲜和罗马尼亚报纸警告美国侵略者不要忘记历史教训

    苏联各地人民集会支持党和政府的政策
    时刻准备反击美国战争狂人的挑衅
    朝鲜和罗马尼亚报纸警告美国侵略者不要忘记历史教训
    新华社7日讯　据塔斯社6日讯：苏联的城市和农村，各地的工业企业、集体农庄、机关和学校，连日来都在举行群众大会、集会和座谈会，讨论苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在苏联最高苏维埃会议上所作的报告。
    各地的集会纷纷通过决议，表示完全赞同苏联共产党和政府所采取的旨在提高人民生活水平的措施，并一致支持苏联政府奉行的缓和国际紧张局势的外交政策。劳动人民在这些决议中对于美国战争狂人对苏联的挑衅行为表示愤慨，他们认为，美国在大国政府首脑会议开会前夕进行这种挑衅，是为了力图在各国人民之间散布不信任空气并破坏和平的巩固。
    塔什干内燃机车车辆修理厂工人阿卜杜拉耶夫在工厂的群众大会上说，我们对于党和政府关怀人民福利的回答是：我们将以更大的热情来工作。他说，我们知道，我国的成就鼓舞着世界上一切善良的人们。但是，我们也不能忘记，这些成就使得“冷战”的鼓吹者很不安。我们工厂的工人在听到了把侵入苏联领空的敌机击落的消息后，感到非常高兴。他强调说，每个胆敢破坏苏联人民的和平劳动的人都将遭到同样的命运。
    第比利斯电气机厂的“共产主义劳动队”队长恰杜涅利说，我们党的利益永远符合全体苏联人民的利益。
    新西伯利亚的建筑工作者斯皮林回忆起他在去年同访问苏联的美国副总统尼克松的一次谈话。尼克松当时答应稍后回答他提的这样一个问题：美国领导人为永久消除战争威胁做了些什么。斯皮林说，结果，尼克松先生的回答是美国飞机的强盗式的飞行。
    斯皮林说，赫鲁晓夫讲一千次也是对的，因为他讲的是全体人民的话——谁拿刀枪进攻我们，谁就必将死于刀枪之下。我们决不放过敌人。
    中士鲁布佐夫说，我们的力量和威力支持着赫鲁晓夫对战争挑拨者的严正警告。他强调指出：“我们今后应当时刻准备着。”
    新华社平壤7日电　“民主朝鲜报”7日发表社论，热烈欢迎赫鲁晓夫在苏联最高苏维埃会议上所作的报告，并警告美国侵略者不要忘记历史教训。
    社论说：“苏联取消工人和职员赋税的措施，集中地表现了社会主义制度比劳动人民纳税负担日益加重的资本主义制度具有无比的优越性。”这一措施是建设共产主义的苏联人民取得的又一个巨大的成就。
    社论说：“苏联和全体社会主义国家在第二次世界大战后，为了实现波茨坦协定，为了防止在欧洲和亚洲产生新的战争根源，为了保卫世界和平，一直在进行不懈的努力。但是，美帝国主义却在西德复活了德国军国主义，在东方复活了日本帝国主义，以便利用它们充当反对社会主义阵营的新的侵略战争的突击队；今天，西德和日本已成为新的最危险的战争策源地。
    社论强调说，美帝国主义的战争政策和它在世界各地组织的军事集团和设立的军事基地，成了今天严重威胁和平和安全、加剧国际紧张局势的主要原因。社论说：我们要严肃地警告美帝国主义侵略者，不要忘记第二次世界大战的历史教训。
    社论强调说：必须立即制止美帝国主义及其追随者挑起新的侵略战争的阴谋，美国侵略军必须毫不迟延地从南朝鲜和亚洲地区撤走，必须废除日美军事同盟等侵略性的军事集团，撤除美国军事基地。
    新华社布加勒斯特7日电　罗马尼亚“火花报”7日发表文章，欢迎赫鲁晓夫在苏联最高苏维埃会议上所作的报告。
    文章叙述了苏联在为人民创造幸福生活方面所取得的辉煌成就。
    文章接着指出，在最高级会议的前夕，赫鲁晓夫在报告中明确地提出了苏联的外交政策，这一事实是很重要的。文章说，当苏联在积极为最高级会议创造有利气氛的时候，其它参加国却至今未表示它们真正愿意寻求能被接受的和具体的解决办法。尼克松、赫脱、狄龙等发表的有关最高级会议的声明，以及美国众议院最近通过的与和平共处背道而驰的决议，是根本不符合时代精神的。
    文章指出，更严重的是最近几星期以来美国飞机已两次侵犯了苏联领空。这是一种挑衅行动，而且是发生在最高级会议召开之前，这就特别严重。
    文章又说，假使有人以为可以通过会谈从苏联方面取得某种单方面的让步，那是做梦。继续增强社会主义阵营，蓬勃开展世界各地争取和平的斗争，就能保证使制造紧张局势的人遭到新的失败。
