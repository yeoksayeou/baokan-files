Fifteen Years of Glorious Victory in Czechoslovakia

Today, May 9th, marks the fifteenth anniversary of the victory over Fascist Germany and the fifteenth anniversary of the liberation of Czechoslovakia. The mighty Soviet army crushed the aggressive forces of Fascist Germany in World War II, liberating Czechoslovakia and other Eastern European countries, making extremely great contributions to the noble cause of world peace and human progress. The Chinese people, along with all progressive humanity, pay the highest respect to the glorious Soviet army and extend warm congratulations on the liberation day of the fraternal Czechoslovak people!

Fifteen years ago today, the Soviet army liberated Prague, eliminating the German fascist bandits who had once run rampant on Czechoslovak soil. From then on, the Czechoslovak people gained freedom and began the most beautiful period in their history—a new era in which the people are the masters of their own affairs. In 1948, the Czechoslovak Communist Party led the people to crush the bourgeois reactionaries' conspiracy to restore capitalism, established the dictatorship of the proletariat, and then comprehensively launched socialist transformation and socialist construction, achieving brilliant achievements in just fifteen years. The 11th Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party in 1958 summarized the achievements of socialist construction, solemnly declared that Czechoslovakia had basically built the foundations of socialism, and further proposed a grand program for completing socialist construction. Now the Czechoslovak people are fighting with full confidence to realize this great program.

The fifteen years since the liberation of the Czechoslovak people have been fifteen years of unprecedented economic, political, and cultural development. After using a very short period to heal the enormous wounds suffered by the national economy during the war, they marched forward in great strides along the general line of socialist construction formulated by the Czechoslovak Communist Party, eliminated the unbalanced development and distribution of industrial sectors left over from the old system, established a strong heavy industrial base, and made industrial production advance at a speed never seen in capitalist countries. In 1959, industrial production reached 3.6 times the pre-war peak level; while in the formerly backward Slovak region, industrial production increased 7.6 times compared to pre-war levels. The per capita output of some major industrial products has exceeded or approached that of the most developed capitalist countries. Czechoslovakia has basically completed the socialist transformation of agriculture. The past 1.5 million scattered small-peasant economies have been united in 12,500 unified agricultural production cooperatives, and 85% of the country's agricultural land is now owned by the socialist economy, with agricultural production thriving. On the basis of vigorous production development, the material and cultural living standards of the people have also greatly improved. Moreover, the real wages of workers and staff have increased by about half compared to 1937. The great achievements gained by the Czechoslovak people in the past fifteen years once again vividly demonstrate the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system.

Based on the great achievements of the past fifteen years, Czechoslovakia has recently put forward a third five-year plan (1961-1965) for further high-speed development of the national economy. The goal of this new five-year plan is to complete socialist construction and create the prerequisites for a gradual transition to communism. The plan stipulates that industrial production will increase by at least half in five years, agricultural production will increase by 40% compared to 1957, and the total investment in the national economy will increase by about half compared to the second five-year plan. By 1965, Czechoslovakia will be able to produce the entire year's industrial products of pre-war 1937 in just sixty days, and will exceed the most developed capitalist countries in terms of per capita output of the most important industrial products. This great goal inspires the Czechoslovak people to devote themselves to the construction of their motherland.

Czechoslovakia has always unswervingly pursued a peaceful foreign policy, actively supporting all peaceful initiatives of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, and opposing the imperialist policies of aggression and war. As a neighbor of Germany and a country that suffered from the aggression of Fascist Germany, Czechoslovakia firmly advocates a peaceful settlement of the German question and opposes the United States' support for West German militarism. Czechoslovakia has always given active support to the struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against imperialism and colonialism and for national independence. All of these have made a positive contribution to Czechoslovakia's efforts to safeguard European security and world peace, gaining increasing international prestige.

The Czechoslovak Communist Party is the organizer and inspirer of all the brilliant achievements of the Czechoslovak people. It holds high the banner of Marxism-Leninism and leads the people to firmly advance along the road of socialism. It has always safeguarded the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and, together with the fraternal parties, has waged a resolute struggle against the modern revisionism of Yugoslavia.

Czechoslovakia and China have formed an unbreakable friendship on the ideological basis of Marxism-Leninism. Over the past decade, the cooperative relations between China and Czechoslovakia in political, economic, and cultural fields have achieved tremendous development and have been increasingly consolidated. Mutual visits by party and government leaders of the two countries have continuously enhanced our fraternal relations. The "Sino-Czechoslovak Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation" signed in 1957 has brought the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries to a new stage. Over the past decade, the people of China and Czechoslovakia have always supported each other and cooperated with each other in international struggles. In socialist construction, China and Czechoslovakia have also helped each other and cooperated with each other. Trade between China and Czechoslovakia has continued to develop, with the trade volume in 1960 increasing six and a half times compared to 1950; scientific and cultural cooperation and exchanges between the two countries have also been continuously strengthened. We believe that the unbreakable friendship between the people of China and Czechoslovakia will be increasingly strengthened and developed.

As we celebrate the glorious Czechoslovak Liberation Day, we see the Czechoslovak people striding forward along the road of socialism. Our people are delighted and encouraged by the brilliant achievements made by the fraternal Czechoslovak people in the past fifteen years, and firmly believe that they will achieve even greater victories in fulfilling the glorious task of completing socialist construction!

    捷克斯洛伐克光荣胜利的十五年
    今年5月9日，是战胜法西斯德国的十五周年，也是捷克斯洛伐克解放的十五周年。强大的苏联军队在第二次世界大战中打垮了法西斯德国的侵略势力，解放了捷克斯洛伐克和其他东欧国家，对世界和平和人类进步的崇高事业作出了极其伟大的贡献。中国人民和全体进步人类一起，向光荣的苏联军队致以崇高的敬意，并对兄弟般的捷克斯洛伐克人民的解放节日表示热烈的祝贺！
    十五年前的今天，苏联军队解放了布拉格，消灭了曾在捷克斯洛伐克土地上横行一时的德国法西斯匪帮。从此，捷克斯洛伐克人民获得了自由，开始了历史上最美好的时期——人民当家作主的新纪元。1948年，捷克斯洛伐克共产党领导人民粉碎了资产阶级反动派复辟的阴谋，确立了无产阶级专政，接着全面展开社会主义改造和社会主义建设，并在短短的十五年中取得了辉煌的成就。1958年捷克斯洛伐克共产党第十一次代表大会，总结了社会主义建设的成就，庄严地宣告捷克斯洛伐克基本上建成了社会主义的基础，并进一步提出完成社会主义建设的宏伟纲领。现在捷克斯洛伐克人民正在满怀信心地为实现这一伟大纲领而奋斗。
    捷克斯洛伐克人民解放后的十五年，是经济、政治和文化空前发展的十五年。他们在用了极短的时间医治好国民经济在战争期间遭到的巨大创伤以后，就沿着捷克斯洛伐克共产党所制定的社会主义建设总路线大踏步前进，消除了旧制度遗留下来的工业各部门发展和分布的不平衡状况，建立了强大的重工业基地，使工业生产以资本主义国家从未有过的速度向前发展。1959年工业生产已达到战前最高水平的三点六倍；而在原来落后的斯洛伐克地区，工业生产则比战前增长了七点六倍。一些主要工业品按人口平均计算的产量，已经超过或接近工业最发达的资本主义国家。捷克斯洛伐克已基本上完成了农业的社会主义改造。过去一百五十万户分散的小农经济，已经联合在一万二千五百个统一农业生产合作社里，全国农业用地的85％已为社会主义经济所有，农业生产蒸蒸日上。在生产蓬勃发展的基础上，人民的物质和文化生活水平也大大提高了。而且职工的实际工资约比1937年提高了一半。捷克斯洛伐克人民十五年来所获得的伟大成就，再一次生动地显示了社会主义制度对资本主义制度的无比优越性。
    在十五年来的伟大成就的基础上，捷克斯洛伐克最近又提出了进一步高速度发展国民经济的第三个五年计划（1961—1965年），这个新五年计划的目标是完成社会主义建设，为逐步向共产主义过渡创造前提。计划规定五年间工业生产至少增长一半，农业生产比1957年要增加40％，而国民经济的投资总额要比第二个五年计划大约增加一半以上。到1965年，捷克斯洛伐克只要用六十天的时间就能生产出战前1937年全年的工业产品，在最重要的工业产品按人口计算的产量方面将超过最发达的资本主义国家。这一伟大目标鼓舞着捷克斯洛伐克人民投身于祖国的建设事业中。
    捷克斯洛伐克始终不渝地执行着和平外交政策，积极支持苏联和其他社会主义国家的一切和平倡议，反对帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策。作为德国的邻国和身受法西斯德国侵略的国家，捷克斯洛伐克坚决主张德国问题的和平解决，反对美国扶植西德军国主义。捷克斯洛伐克对于亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义、争取民族独立的斗争，一向给予积极的支持。所有这些，都使捷克斯洛伐克对维护欧洲安全和世界和平作出了积极的贡献，获得日益增长的国际威信。
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党是捷克斯洛伐克人民取得所有这些光辉成就的组织者和鼓舞者，它高举马克思列宁主义的旗帜，领导人民坚定地沿着社会主义的道路前进。它一贯维护以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大团结，并同各兄弟党一道，对南斯拉夫的现代修正主义进行了坚决的斗争。
    捷克斯洛伐克同中国在马克思列宁主义的思想基础上，结成了牢不可破的友谊。十年来，中捷两国无论在政治、经济和文化方面的合作关系，都获得了巨大的发展，并且日益巩固。两国党政领导人的相互访问，不断增进着我们之间的兄弟关系。1957年签订的“中捷友好合作条约”，更使两国的友好合作关系进入了新的阶段。十年来，中捷两国人民在国际斗争中一向互相支持，彼此合作。在社会主义建设方面，中捷两国也互相援助，彼此协作。中捷两国贸易不断发展，1960年的贸易额已比1950年增加了六倍半；两国的科学和文化的合作和交流也在不断加强。我们相信，中捷两国人民牢不可破的友谊，将日益加强和发展。
    当我们欢庆光辉的捷克斯洛伐克解放日的时候，我们看到捷克斯洛伐克人民正沿着社会主义的道路阔步前进。我国人民为兄弟般的捷克斯洛伐克人民十五年来所取得的辉煌成就而欢欣鼓舞，并且坚决相信他们在实现完成社会主义建设的光荣任务中，将获得更加伟大的胜利！
