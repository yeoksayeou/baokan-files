Spring Hatching Has Many Benefits
Nong Zu

Spring has suitable temperatures, hens lay more eggs, and broodiness is strong, making it the best season for large-scale poultry hatching.

Spring hatching has many benefits. Chicks hatched in the spring can be slaughtered and eaten as cockerels by late autumn and early winter, and hens begin to lay eggs, providing more poultry and egg products to the market. At the same time, late spring and early summer are when natural feed is very abundant, which can effectively utilize wild feed and save breeding costs. More importantly, the annual poultry production plan must complete most of it during the peak egg production season in spring. Therefore, vigorously developing spring hatching is the key to ensuring the realization of the annual poultry farming plan.

To hatch hundreds of millions of poultry in just a few months and ensure that every single one survives, it is impossible to have no difficulties in the work. However, as long as we have great enthusiasm, first establish confidence in completing the spring hatching plan, despise difficulties, and then take practical and effective measures on various specific issues, we can overcome difficulties. For example, regarding the problem of hatching eggs, there are about four to five hundred million laying hens in the country. Calculating on the basis of each hen laying fifty eggs in the first half of the year, there would be 20 to 25 billion eggs. Although the amount of hatching eggs is not small, the problem can be solved as long as we seize the source of eggs, fully tap the existing potential, strengthen publicity and education to the masses, and organize purchases and adjustments, as the distribution is not very balanced and some areas may experience a shortage of hatching eggs.

Ensuring the survival of every chick is a crucial link in realizing the great development of poultry production. Binhai County, Jiangsu Province, mobilized hatchery workers to vigorously carry out technical reforms, studied the key to the survival of chicks, and created a method of combining "hatching, brooding, and feeding", so that chicks grow in a stable and suitable temperature, thereby increasing the survival rate of chicks to 95%. These examples fully demonstrate that as long as the leadership is good at relying on the masses and mobilizing everyone to come up with ideas and suggestions, we can greatly improve the survival rate of chicks.

Currently, we must seize the favorable opportunity of spring hatching, rapidly launch a mass spring hatching movement, and overfulfill the poultry spring hatching plan.

    春孵好处多
    农组
    春季气温适宜，母鸡产蛋多，抱窝性强，是大搞家禽孵化最好的季节。
    春孵的好处很多，春季孵出的小鸡到秋末冬初，公鸡可以宰杀食用，母鸡开始产蛋，能够提供给市场更多的禽、蛋产品；同时，春末夏初正是自然饲料非常丰富的时候，可以有效地利用野生饲料，节约饲养成本；更重要的，是全年家禽生产计划，必须趁春季产蛋旺季完成大半。因此大力开展春孵是保证实现全年养禽计划的关键。
    要在短短几个月内孵出数以亿计的家禽，还要保证只只成活，在工作中不可能没有一点困难。但是，只要我们有一个很大的干劲，首先在完成春孵计划上树立信心，藐视困难，然后在各个具体问题上采取切实有效的办法，就可以克服困难。例如种蛋问题，全国约有产蛋母禽四、五亿只，在上半年按每只母禽产蛋五十个计算，就有二百至二百五十亿个。种蛋量虽不算少，但是由于分布不十分平衡，某些地区可能出现种蛋不足的情况。只要抓紧蛋源，充分挖掘现有潜力，加强向群众的宣传教育，组织收购调剂，问题是可以解决的。
    保证雏鸡只只成活，更是实现家禽生产大发展的决定一环。江苏省滨海县发动孵房职工大闹技术改革，研究雏禽成活的关键，创造了“孵化、育雏、饲养”三结合的办法，使雏禽在稳定适宜的温度下生长，从而提高雏禽成活率达95％。这些事例充分说明，只要领导善于依靠群众，发动大家想办法、出主意，我们完全可以使雏鸡成活率大为提高。
    当前要抓紧春孵有利时机，迅速开展群众性的春孵运动，超额完成家禽春孵计划。
