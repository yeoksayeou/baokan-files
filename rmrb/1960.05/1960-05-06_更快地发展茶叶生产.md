    Faster Development of Tea Production

    Tea is a necessity in the lives of the Chinese people and an important export commodity. Since liberation, under the leadership of the Party, tea production has greatly developed, with output increasing by more than twofold. Tea trees are perennial crops, and it is a remarkable achievement to have achieved such great progress in such a short period of time. However, with the great development of the country's industrial and agricultural production, and with the improvement of people's living standards, the need for tea will continue to grow. In the future, not only is it necessary to produce more tea in terms of quantity, but also to gradually improve its quality. Therefore, faster and better development of tea production has become an important task for tea-producing areas.

    Based on the experience of the Great Leap Forward in tea production over the past two years, the first step to develop tea production at high speed is to thoroughly transform old tea gardens. Thoroughly changing the backward state of old tea gardens, which are aging, scattered, and sparsely planted, is an effective measure to increase production. Old tea gardens are the basic force of current tea production. At present, we have created a complete set of methods for large-scale transformation of old tea gardens, such as pruning and renewal, replanting missing seedlings, and transplanting and merging, which can increase production in the same year of transformation. Xiapu County in Fujian Province is a prominent county in the transformation of old tea gardens. In 1958, 80% of the old tea trees in the county were transformed, and production increased by 50% in the same year, and by more than 30% last year. This year, various places have a large task in transforming old tea gardens, and it is hoped that this task will be completed diligently.

    Vigorously developing new tea gardens is also an important aspect of developing tea production at high speed. New tea gardens adopt the method of concentrated planting in strips and close planting, and the yield per unit area is several times or even dozens of times higher than that of old tea gardens; at the same time, it is convenient for mechanical cultivation and fine management. Therefore, new tea gardens are not only a vital force for increasing production in large quantities, but also a pioneer in the modernization of tea production.

    Since 1958, various tea-producing areas have comprehensively promoted the advanced experience of multiple plucking and batch plucking, which has led to a rapid increase in the proportion of summer and autumn tea. In 1959, the proportion of autumn tea in the total annual output increased from 25% in 1957 to 40%. Many counties, communes, and teams in Zhejiang, Fujian, Hunan and other provinces have also seen examples of summer tea exceeding spring tea, autumn tea exceeding spring tea, and a bountiful harvest in every season. From the perspective of the biological characteristics of tea trees and the experience of the masses, tea only sprouts after being plucked. If spring tea is not plucked, summer tea will not sprout; if summer tea is not plucked, autumn tea will not sprout. Therefore, batch and multiple plucking is in line with the growth law of tea trees. Improving tea picking technology is an important link in increasing the yield per unit area of tea gardens, and all production units in tea areas must firmly grasp it starting from spring tea production.

    Vigorously carrying out technological innovation and realizing semi-mechanization and mechanized tea making is an important way to improve tea making efficiency and tea quality, and reduce costs. Tea production, from tea garden management to preliminary processing, requires a lot of manual labor. After the realization of people's communes, unprecedentedly favorable conditions have been created for realizing mechanized and semi-mechanized tea making. This year, more regions have adopted semi-mechanization and mechanization in tea primary processing. The leading departments in various tea-producing areas should vigorously summarize and promote experience in this area in the mass technological revolution and technological innovation movement.

    Further giving play to the superiority of the people's communes, boosting greater efforts, and conscientiously implementing various measures to increase tea production will definitely be able to further accelerate the development of tea production in our country.

### 更快地发展茶叶生产

    更快地发展茶叶生产
    茶叶是我国人民生活中的一种必需品，又是重要的出口物资。解放以来，在党的领导下，茶叶生产获得了很大的发展，产量增长了二倍多。茶树是多年生作物，在这短短几年内，能够获得这样大的成就，是一件了不起的事情。但是，随着国家工农业生产的大发展，随着人民生活水平的提高，对茶叶的需要还将不断的增长。今后不仅从数量上需要生产更多的茶叶，而且在质量上也要求逐步提高。因此，更快更好地发展茶叶生产，就成了茶叶产区的一项重要任务。
    根据两年来茶叶生产大跃进的经验，高速度地发展茶叶生产，首先是彻底改造旧茶园。彻底改变旧茶园衰老、分散和稀植的落后状态，是一项有效的增产措施。旧茶园是当前茶叶生产的基本力量，目前我们已经创造了一整套大面积改造旧茶园的方法，如修剪更新、补植缺株、移植归并等方法，当年改造当年就能增产。福建省霞浦县是改造旧茶园比较突出的一个县，1958年全县有80％的老茶树进行了改造，当年就增产了50％，去年又增产了30％以上。今年各地改造旧茶园任务很大，希望努力完成这项任务。
    大力发展新茶园，也是高速度发展茶叶生产的一个重要方面。新茶园采取成片集中、条栽密植的方法，单位产量比旧茶园高出几倍以至十几倍；同时便于机械耕作和精细管理。因此，新茶园不仅是大量增产的生力军，也是茶叶生产向现代化发展的先锋。
    1958年以来各茶区全面推行了多次采、分批采的先进经验，使夏秋茶比重有了迅速的增长。1959年秋茶占全年产量的比重已由1957年的25％上升到40％，浙江、福建、湖南等省不少县、社、队还出现了夏茶超春茶、秋茶超春茶、一季顶全年的季季丰产的事例。从茶树生物学特性和群众经验来看，茶叶是采了才发，春茶不采夏茶不发，夏茶不采秋茶不发，因此分批多次采摘是符合茶树的生长规律的。改进采茶技术是提高茶园单位产量的一个重要环节，茶区各生产单位一定要由春茶生产开始紧紧抓住它。
    大搞技术革新，实现半机械化和机械化制茶，是提高制茶效率和茶叶质量、降低成本的重要途径。茶叶生产从茶园管理到初制加工都需要较多的人工，实现人民公社化以后，为实现机械化半机械化制茶创造了空前有利的条件。今年有更多的地区在茶叶初制上采用了半机械化和机械化，各茶区领导部门，在全民性技术革命、技术革新运动中大力总结和推广这方面的经验。
    进一步发挥人民公社的优越性，鼓起更大的干劲，认真地贯彻执行各项增产茶叶的措施，就一定能够进一步加快我国茶叶生产的发展速度。
