    Cheer for the Giant Satellite Spaceship!
    Guo Moruo

It has laid the foundation for mankind's future spaceflight. Look, the Soviet Union has launched a giant satellite spaceship! The total weight of the ship is more than 4,540 kilograms, complete with all the equipment necessary for human spaceflight, and a load imitating a human weight inside. This is another amazing development of science and technology, ruthlessly leaving American imperialism far behind. The other day, the American imperialists also launched a small potato, which was said to be preparing to broadcast some speech by Eisenhower, so that people all over the world could hear it. Poor little potato, it didn't have the courage to fly into the sky, and lost its footing and fell into the deep abyss of the Pacific Ocean. This is good, so that people will not be deceived by Ike again, but clearly see through the ugly face of the American empire, which seems to have lost money at the Paris meeting. I think Ike's trip to Paris was not very decent: if he wanted to talk about deterrence, he lost the means to carry out deterrence; if he wanted to talk about peace, his mask had already been torn off; in his heart, he might be complaining to the black jet fighter, how could it be shot down by the Soviet Union on "May Day"? What's more, the "democratic window" in South Korea has been smashed to pieces, the anti-American movement of the Japanese people has turned the world upside down again, the Turkish people want to overthrow the Menderes regime, and the flames of Cuba are about to spread all over the Latin American backyard. It is truly "misfortunes never come singly," I am afraid he can't help but sigh. However, the logic of robbers still does not know how to turn around, perhaps saying that it was political propaganda before the Paris meeting, and it is not uncommon to have no real people on board! In short, they will not admit defeat. This is the habit of imperialism. The US military budget can be increased once again. Yes, a cornered dog can jump over a wall, so we must guard against any possible adventures. We should not be too optimistic about the robber's awareness. Only by strengthening the forces of peace can we stop disasters, and only by overwhelming imperialism can we guarantee safety. Here, I cheer for the Soviet Union's achievements a thousand times! The Soviet Union has demonstrated the incomparable advantages of socialism, and the Soviet Union has already climbed to the forefront of world science. Work hard, the East Wind must further prevail over the West Wind. We must work hard to learn from the Soviet Union, whip the horse and speed up! Go all out, aim high, and never allow any mistakes, waste, or delays!

    为巨型的卫星飞船欢呼！
    郭沫若为人类未来的宇宙飞行奠定了开端，看，苏联发射了一个巨型的卫星飞船！全船的重量是四千五百四十多公斤，人作宇宙飞行时必需的设备一切齐全，还有一个模仿人重的载荷装在里面。这又是一个惊人的科学技术的发展，无情地把美帝国主义远远抛在后边。前两天美帝也发射了一个小山药蛋，据说还准备转播艾森豪威尔的什么发言，让全世界的人都能够听见。可怜那个山药蛋没有胆量飞上天，自行失脚落水，掉进太平洋的深渊。这倒好，免得人们又受艾克的欺骗，而却明显地看穿了美帝的一副丑脸，在巴黎的会议上看来是折了本钱。我想艾克的巴黎之行实在不大体面：要讲威慑吧，失掉了进行威慑的手段，要讲和平吧，假面具又早已被人揭穿；内心里可能在向黑色喷气机埋怨，如何在“五一”偏偏被苏联打下平川？何况南朝鲜的“民主橱窗”打得稀烂，日本人民的反美运动又复地翻天，土耳其人民要推翻曼德列斯政权，古巴的烽火快燃遍拉丁美洲后院，真真是“祸不单行”呵，怕不免长吁短叹。然而强盗逻辑还不知道又如何转弯，或许会说那是巴黎会议前的政治宣传，没有装载真正的人并不算什么稀罕！总之，不会服输，这是帝国主义的习惯，美国的军事预算借此又可以增加一番。是的，狗急可以跳墙，要预防万一的冒险，对于强盗的觉悟，我们不好过于乐观。只有加强和平力量才能够制止灾难，只有压倒帝国主义才能够保证安全，在这里我为苏联的成就欢呼一千遍！苏联显示了社会主义的无比的优点，苏联已经攀登上世界科学的最尖端。努力呵，东风还必须进一步压倒西风，我们必须努力向苏联学习，快马加鞭！鼓足干劲，力争上游，决不容差费少慢！
