    U.S. Military Bases are Disasters
    Wǔ Sī
    Under the powerful exposure and attack by the Japanese people, the facts of the Kishi Nobusuke group's collusion with U.S. imperialism in carrying out espionage activities against the Soviet Union and China, and the aggressive nature of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, have been thoroughly exposed. The Kishi Nobusuke group, which is single-mindedly trying to force the military alliance treaty through the Diet, is in a state of chaos and unease.
    In addition to playing the trick of so-called "guarantees" provided by the United States that U-2 aircraft will not be used for intelligence gathering activities in order to deceive the people, the Kishi Nobusuke group not only refuses to accept the Japanese people's demand for U.S. U-2 aircraft to leave Japan, but also openly slanders the Soviet Union's serious warning to those countries providing bases for U.S. spy planes as so-called "intimidation" of Japan, and clamors that if Japanese bases are attacked, it will invoke Article 5 of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and take joint military action with the United States. This clamor of the Kishi Nobusuke group shows its determination to collude with U.S. imperialism, to make enemies of China and the Soviet Union, and to carry out aggressive activities, and vainly attempts to use this to intimidate the Soviet Union, but this threat cannot stop the Soviet Union from taking necessary self-defense actions. The Kishi Nobusuke group is actually single-mindedly trying to turn Japan into a war target. Foreign Minister Fujiyama also said that if U.S. U-2 aircraft are required to withdraw from Japan, that would be advocating for not having the "Security Treaty". This proves that the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" that the Kishi Nobusuke group is trying to get passed by the Japanese Diet will bring Japan not security, but serious war danger.
    However, the Japanese people will not allow Kishi Nobusuke to manipulate their fate. The Kishi Nobusuke government's disastrous policy of blindly relying on U.S. imperialism has been met with increasingly resolute resistance from the Japanese people. The Japanese people's opposition to the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and demand for the United States to withdraw U-2 aircraft have pointed out the direction for the people of all countries with U.S. military bases: In order to safeguard national independence and sovereignty, and to defend peace and the security of the people, it is necessary to resolutely struggle to abolish U.S. military bases and drive out U.S. imperialism.

    美军基地就是灾难
    武斯
    在日本人民的有力揭露和打击下，岸信介集团勾结美帝国主义对苏联和中国进行间谍活动的事实，日美军事同盟条约的侵略性质，都已彻底暴露。一心要在国会强行通过军事同盟条约的岸信介集团正陷于一片混乱和不安之中。
    岸信介集团除了玩弄所谓美国提供不把U—2型飞机用于收集情报活动的“保证”，以欺骗人民之外，不仅不接受日本人民要美国U—2型飞机离开日本的要求，而且公然诬蔑苏联对那些为美国间谍飞机提供基地的国家提出的严重警告，是所谓“威吓”日本，叫嚷如日本基地遭到反击时，将援引新日美“安全条约”第五条的规定，同美国采取联合军事行动。岸信介集团的这种叫嚣，表明了它决心勾结美帝国主义，以中苏为敌，进行侵略活动，并妄想以此来威吓苏联，但是这种威胁是阻止不了苏联采取必要的自卫行动的。岸信介集团实际上是一心要把日本变成为战争靶子而已。藤山外相还说，如果要求美国U—2型飞机撤离日本，那就是主张不要“安全条约”。这正好证明岸信介集团在力图使日本国会通过的日美“安全条约”将给日本带来的绝不是什么安全，而是严重的战争危险。
    但是，日本人民是不会听任岸信介摆布他们的命运的。岸信介政府一味投靠美帝国主义的祸国殃民的政策，已经遭到日本人民日益坚决的反抗。日本人民反对美日军事同盟条约，要求美国撤出U—2型飞机，已经为一切有美国军事基地的各国人民指出了方向：为了维护国家的独立和主权，保卫和平和人民的安全，就必须坚决的斗争，取消美国军事基地，赶走美帝国主义。
