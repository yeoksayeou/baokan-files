This newspaper comprehensively reports that the working people of socialist countries are greeting "May Day" International Labor Day with soaring labor enthusiasm and glorious production achievements.

    **Soviet Union**

    In the socialist labor emulation drive to greet "May Day," many economic regions in the Soviet Union have successively completed their production plans for the first four months of the year ahead of schedule. For example, industrial enterprises in Moscow completed their total output value plan for the first four months of this year ahead of schedule on the 27th, and decided to produce products worth several hundred million rubles above the plan by the end of April. The Leningrad economic region also completed the total industrial output value plan for the first four months ahead of schedule on the 27th, with the total output value of enterprises in the city increasing by more than 11% compared with the same period last year. The Kiev economic region, after completing the four-month production plan four days ahead of schedule, earned profits of 35 million rubles from reducing product costs above the plan. In the first four months of this year, enterprises in this economic region manufactured about 60 new types of machines and lathes, and more than 30 automated production lines and conveying devices were put into production.

    In the vast fields, agricultural workers are accelerating spring field work to greet "May Day." As of April 25, collective farms and state farms across the country had sown more than 28.5 million hectares of spring crops, one-third of which was completed in the five days after the 20th.

    **Bulgaria**

    Success stories are constantly coming from all parts of Bulgaria. The workers of industrial enterprises in the Ruse region, one of the country's famous industrial centers, completed their production plan for the first four months of this year on April 27 to welcome "May Day."

    The 6,000 workers of the "Georgi Dimitrov" shipbuilding and repair factory in Varna, a city on the Black Sea coast in eastern Bulgaria, launched a vigorous "May Day" competition. One production team at this factory completed an average of 237% of its production quota every day.

    **Hungary**

    Industrial and mining enterprises in Hungary have overfulfilled their production plans for the first quarter and April. The output of the metallurgical industry increased by 10% compared with the same period last year, the machinery manufacturing sector increased by 16%, and the food industry increased by 20%.

    The workers of the Lenin Metallurgical United Factory held a festival week to welcome "May Day," and each workshop put forward specific tasks as gifts. On the first day of the festival week, ironmaking workers over-smelted 162 tons of pig iron, and steelworkers increased production of 30 tons of high-quality steel. A construction team completed a new steelmaking furnace before "May Day."

    **Vietnam**

    As "May Day" International Labor Day approaches, the competition movement launched by the working people in the north of Vietnam to present gifts to the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the 70th birthday of President Ho Chi Minh is developing more vigorously.

    In order to realize their challenge to complete the three-year plan three months ahead of schedule, which was proposed to various enterprises, the workers of the Hanoi Machine Factory, the largest modern machine factory in northern Vietnam, have tried every means to carry out technological reforms and improve labor organization. In the first quarter, the factory put forward a total of 192 rationalization proposals. Now, after completing the first quarter plan 14 days ahead of schedule, they are determined to complete the second quarter production plan before May 9.

    The competition movement at the Hai Phong Cement Plant is being carried out more enthusiastically, extensively, and deeply than in previous years. This famous large enterprise broke the first-quarter record since the restoration of peace in the first quarter of this year, completing more than 26% of the annual plan. In the first 20 days of April, it produced an additional 1,600 tons of cement.

    The vigorous movement to fight drought, build water conservancy projects, apply fertilizer, and strengthen field management, which was launched in the vast rural areas of northern Vietnam to strive for an early rice harvest, has achieved great results. Hai Duong Province, which has achieved bumper harvests in previous years, has taken the lead in the movement and has become a red banner in water conservancy construction. The "Giant Thunder" movement on Highway 5, launched in the province in March, mobilized thousands of troops to fight day and night on the water conservancy front. In just ten days, it completed 744,000 cubic meters of earthwork. The amount of work in ten days was equal to the amount of work in the past three months.

    **Korea**

    The working people of northern Korea have launched an enthusiastic labor competition to welcome "May Day" Labor Day, using practical actions to increase production to support their compatriots in South Korea.

    The workers of the Kim Chaek Iron and Steel Works, who are planning to produce 70,000 tons more pig iron and 30,000 tons more steel than planned this year, further increased the temperature of the blast furnace in April, increasing the average daily output of pig iron by 300 tons compared to the first quarter. The workers of the Ki Yang Machinery Factory, which is cooperating with various machinery factories to produce 3,000 tractors this year to support agricultural mechanization, have recently further innovated technology, applying 36 rationalization proposals and innovation projects to production, further shortening the production time of each tractor by 90 man-hours. The workers of the Aoji Coal Mine, the largest bituminous coal mine in northern Korea, are determined to complete this year's annual coal mining plan four and a half months ahead of schedule before "August 15."

    **Mongolia**

    Mongolian workers are welcoming "May Day" International Labor Day with excellent labor achievements. The Mongolian Industrial United Factory has overfulfilled its production plan for two consecutive months. The shoe factory in this factory completed the production plan for April ten days ahead of schedule, and the workers also put forward many rationalization proposals.

    Rubasangpuurb, a driver at the motor transport station of the Mongolian Ministry of Construction and Building Materials Industry, created the glorious record of 500,000 kilometers of driving without major repairs on the eve of "May Day." At present, the workers of the transportation station have launched a surge of learning from the 500,000-kilometer driver and catching up with the 500,000-kilometer driver. The workers on the agricultural production front are determined to complete the spring plowing and sowing work in a short period of time on the basis of doing a good job in preparing for spring plowing.

    **Poland**

    The characteristic of this year's labor competition in Poland to welcome "May Day" is that many factories have launched labor competitions between factories. At the same time, the labor competition movement is combined with the technological innovation movement. The Dabar Metallurgical Factory in Rzeszów Province once issued a friendship challenge to fraternal factories across the country. The conditions of the challenge are: to complete the plan ahead of schedule every month, save a large amount of raw materials, and reduce defective products. The Chordakovski Artificial Fiber Factory once challenged the chemical factories in the Warsaw area with the condition of producing 8.33 million zlotys (Polish currency) worth of products before "May Day."

    The competition movement initiated by the workers of advanced factories was quickly responded to by many other factories. The workers of the Rzeszów Transportation Equipment Manufacturing Factory responded to the call of the Dabar Metallurgical Factory and decided to complete 101% of the original plan in April and greatly reduce the defective product rate.

    **Romania**

    Many factories in Romania have completed their production plans for April ahead of schedule. The Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej Clothing Factory in Bucharest and the drilling company in Craiova State began working for May on April 20. The first blast furnace workshop of the Hunedoara Metallurgical United Factory also completed its production plan for April four days ahead of schedule. Since the beginning of this year, this workshop has produced more than 7,000 tons of pig iron above the plan. The workers of the "May Day" Shipyard in Braila built a 1,000-ton oil tanker one month ahead of schedule, and they decided to build another 40-ton barge before "May Day" as a gift to the festival.

    The technological innovation movement on the Romanian industrial front is developing in depth. Since the beginning of the year, the workers of the Hunedoara Metallurgical United Enterprise have put forward more than 130 innovation proposals, of which more than 80 have been adopted, which can save more than 15 million lei (Romanian currency). The "Janos Herbak Shoe Factory" has mechanized the work of cutting shoe uppers, which not only reduces the labor of workers but also saves 300,000 lei per year. (Attached picture)

    劳动竞赛热火朝天　生产捷报纷至沓来
    兄弟国家人民用辉煌成就迎接“五一”
    本报综合报道　社会主义国家的劳动人民以高涨的劳动热情和辉煌的生产成就迎接“五一”国际劳动节。
    苏联
    苏联许多经济区在为迎接“五一”节展开的社会主义劳动竞赛中，已先后提前完成了四个月的生产计划。如莫斯科市各工业企业在27日就提前完成了今年头四个月的总产值计划，并决定要在4月底超计划生产价值几亿卢布的产品。列宁格勒经济区也在27日提前完成四个月的工业总产值计划，全市各企业今年头四个月的生产总值比去年同期增加了11％以上。基辅经济区提前四天完成四个月生产计划后，从超计划降低产品成本所获得的利润达三千五百万卢布。这个经济区的许多企业在今年头四个月中共制造了约六十种新型机器和车床，有三十多条自动化作业线和传送装置投入了生产。
    在辽阔的田野上，农业劳动者都在加速春季田间工作以迎接“五一”节，到4月25日为止，全国的集体农庄和国营农场已经播种了二千八百五十多万公顷的春播作物，其中三分之一的面积是在20日以后的五天中完成的。
    保加利亚
    保加利亚各地不断传来捷报。全国有名的工业中心之一鲁西州的工业企业的全体职工为迎接“五一”节，在4月27日完成了今年头四个月的生产计划。
    位于保东部黑海边的瓦尔纳市的“格奥尔基·季米特洛夫”建造和修理轮船工厂的六千名职工展开了热火朝天的“五一”竞赛。这个厂的一个生产队平均每天都完成生产定额的237％。
    匈牙利
    匈牙利各工矿企业都超额完成了第一季度和4月份的生产计划。冶金工业部门第一季度的生产比去年同时期提高10％，机器制造部门的生产提高16％，食品工业提高20％。
    列宁冶金联合厂的职工们为迎接“五一”节举行了节日周，各车间都提出了具体的献礼任务。炼铁职工在节日周的第一天就超额熔炼了一百六十二吨生铁，炼钢工人增产了三十吨优质钢。建筑工作队提前在“五一”节前建成了一座新的炼钢炉。
    越南
    在“五一”国际劳动节来临时，越南北方城乡劳动人民开展的向越南民主共和国成立十五周年献礼和向胡志明主席七十寿辰献礼的竞赛运动，更加汹涌澎湃地向前发展。
    越南北方最大的现代化河内机器厂的职工为了实现他们向各企业提出的提前三个月完成三年计划的挑战，千方百计地进行技术改革和改进劳动组织。第一季度全厂共提出了一百九十二项合理化建议。现在他们在提前十四天完成第一季度计划后，决心在5月9日以前完成第二季度生产计划。
    竞赛运动在海防水泥厂开展得比往年更加热烈、广泛、深入。这个著名的大企业今年第一季度打破和平恢复以来历年第一季度的纪录，完成了全年计划的26％还多。而在4月份的头二十天，又多生产了一千六百吨水泥。
    越南北方广大农村为争取早稻丰收掀起的热火朝天的抗旱、兴修水利、施肥、加强田间管理运动，目前已取得了巨大的成绩。历年都获得丰收的海阳省，在运动中一马当先，成为兴修水利的一面红旗。这个省在3月间开展的五号公路“巨雷”运动，动员了千军万马，日夜战斗在水利战线上，仅十天的时间就完成七十四万四千土方，十天的工作量等于过去三个月的工作量。
    朝鲜
    朝鲜北部劳动人民展开热烈的劳动竞赛，迎接“五一”劳动节，以增加生产的实际行动来支援南朝鲜同胞。
    今年要比计划多生产七万吨生铁和三万吨钢的金策制铁所的工人，在4月份进一步提高了高炉的温度，使生铁平均日产量比第一季度又提高了三百吨。今年为了支援农业机械化要同各机械厂实行协作生产三千台拖拉机的岐阳机械工厂的工人，最近进一步革新技术，把三十六件合理化建议和革新项目用于生产，使每台拖拉机的生产又缩短了九十个工时。朝鲜北部最大烟煤矿——阿吾地煤矿的工人决心要在今年“八·一五”前提前四个半月完成今年全年的采煤计划。
    蒙古
    蒙古职工以优良的劳动成绩迎接“五一”国际劳动节。蒙古工业联合工厂两个月来都超额完成了生产计划。这个工厂中的皮鞋厂提前十天超额完成了4月份的生产计划，职工们还提出许多合理化建议。
    蒙古建筑和建筑材料工业部汽车运输站司机鲁布桑普尔布在“五一”前夕创造了五十万公里行车无大修的光荣纪录。目前运输站的职工掀起了一个学习五十万司机赶五十万司机的热潮。在农业生产战线上的劳动者们决心在作好春耕准备工作的基础上，争取在短期内完成春耕播种工作。
    波兰
    今年波兰迎接“五一”节劳动竞赛的特点是，不少工厂发起了厂际之间的劳动竞赛，同时，劳动竞赛运动是同技术革新运动结合进行的。热舒夫省的达巴尔冶金工厂曾向全国的兄弟工厂提出了友谊挑战。挑战条件是：每月要提前完成计划，大量节约原材料和减少废品。乔达科夫斯基人造纤维工厂曾以在
  “五一”节前多生产八百三十三万兹罗提（波币名）的产品为条件，向华沙区的化学工厂挑战。
    先进工厂职工发起的竞赛运动很快得到了其他许多工厂的响应。热舒夫的交通器材制造厂的职工响应了达巴尔冶金工厂的号召，决定4月份完成原计划的101％，并且大大降低废品率。
    罗马尼亚
    罗马尼亚已有不少工厂提前完成了4月份生产计划。布加勒斯特的乔治乌—德治被服厂和克拉约发州的钻井公司都在4月20日就开始为5月份工作。洪尼多阿拉冶金联合工厂的第一高炉车间也提前四天完成了4月份的生产计划。这个车间从今年初到现在已经超计划生产了七千多吨生铁。布莱拉的“五一”造船厂的工人提前一个月造成了一艘一千吨的油船，他们决定在“五一”节前再造一艘四十吨的驳船向节日献礼。
    罗马尼亚工业战线上的技术革新运动正在深入发展。洪尼多阿拉冶金联合企业的工人们，从年初到现在已经提出了一百三十多项革新建议，其中被采用的八十多项可以节约一千五百多万列伊（罗币名）。“亚诺什·赫尔巴克制鞋厂已经使裁鞋面的工作机械化，这不但减轻了工人的劳动，并且每年能节约三十万列伊。（附图片）
