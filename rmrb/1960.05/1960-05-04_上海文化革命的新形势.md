The forty-first anniversary of the May Fourth Movement has passed.

The cultural revolution carried out during the May Fourth period, under the guidance of communist ideology, centered on thoroughly and uncompromisingly opposing imperialist culture and feudal culture, and prepared ideologically for the new democratic revolution. This cultural revolution movement had a tremendous impact on the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people and made great contributions. Since the May Fourth Movement, the Chinese people's cultural revolution movement has been developing continuously under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. It has played a significant role in mobilizing the broad masses of the Chinese people to carry out democratic revolution, socialist revolution, and socialist construction. Today, an even greater high tide of cultural revolution has emerged before us. The current high tide of cultural revolution in our country is the inevitable product of the victory of the Chinese people's revolution, especially the inevitable product of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes; it has completely new historical characteristics: Mao Zedong Thought, which combines the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution, is being popularized among the whole people; the education cause of cultivating talents for socialist construction in a faster, better, and more economical way and the comprehensive technical revolution movement are developing greatly; the policy of intellectualizing workers and peasants and laborizing intellectuals is being successfully implemented, and the desire of the working people to be masters of culture is becoming a reality; the socialist and national cultural and artistic undertakings are flourishing, and mass sports and health undertakings are rising widely. A cultural revolution movement with such rich content and broad scale is an important front in the general battle line of socialist revolution and socialist construction, an active force promoting and coordinating the continuous development of industrial and agricultural production, and a necessary condition for accelerating China's socialist construction and future transition to communism.

The people of Shanghai, like the people of the whole country, in the great technical innovation and technical revolution movement launched this spring, not only demonstrated their strong will, infinite wisdom and strength to conquer economic backwardness, but also demonstrated their urgent desire and great enthusiasm to conquer cultural backwardness. The vigorous technical revolution movement has not only promoted the continued leap forward of industrial and agricultural production, but also promoted the rapid development of the cultural revolution. Chairman Mao's scientific prediction on the eve of the birth of the People's Republic of China: "With the advent of the high tide of economic construction, a high tide of cultural construction will inevitably appear," is being realized. In Shanghai, a new and prosperous situation of great cultural development, great popularization, and great improvement has begun to emerge.

The broad masses of working people consciously launching a high tide of studying Chairman Mao's works is the most prominent feature of the current cultural revolution in our country. Cultural revolution is first and foremost an ideological revolution. As early as the period of democratic revolution, Chairman Mao clearly instructed: "As far as the policy of national culture is concerned, the guiding ideology is communism, and we should strive to propagate socialism and communism among the working class, and appropriately and step by step use socialism to educate the peasants and other masses." With the emergence of the new situation of the deepening of the socialist revolution and the rapid development of socialist construction in our country, the situation of the great popularization of Marxism-Leninism and the great popularization of Mao Zedong Thought, the greatest thought of our time, has also followed. In this great technical revolution movement, the Shanghai working class deeply felt that only by arming themselves with Mao Zedong Thought can they become ambitious people, all-powerful people, people who dare to think and dare to do, people who are not afraid of difficulties and conquer difficulties, and create miracles. The Shanghai workers' consciousness in studying Chairman Mao's works has been significantly improved, and a mass upsurge of studying theory, speaking theory, writing theory, and applying theory has been launched. Hundreds and thousands of workers, guided by Mao Zedong Thought, have written a number of theoretical articles, read them on the podium, published them in newspapers and magazines, and lectured in universities. The articles they wrote have distinctive features: firm position, clear arguments, and full of combat effectiveness; containing rich and vivid materialist dialectical ideas, and, moreover, substantial and targeted. This is a new initiative of Shanghai workers in the movement to study Mao Zedong Thought since this spring. This eloquent fact has further disintegrated the outdated concept that workers cannot learn theory, let alone use theory.

The broad masses of workers and cadres enthusiastically study Chairman Mao's works because of their urgent needs in the practice of revolutionary and construction struggles. They do not study for the sake of studying, but in order to better grasp the weapon of Mao Zedong Thought, to analyze the contradictions and existing difficulties in their work, to find ways to solve contradictions and overcome difficulties, so as to promote the rapid development of the revolutionary and construction cause. For example, cadres and workers of the Yong'an Printing and Dyeing Factory studied Chairman Mao's "On Contradiction," and based on the philosophical principle of the transformation of contradictions, created a new process that is completely opposite to the old process in the original printing and dyeing industry in this technical revolution, and greatly saved coal consumption under the premise of ensuring quality. Now, many cadres and workers have also begun to learn to systematically explain many new creations in the technical revolution theoretically according to Mao Zedong Thought. This is of far-reaching significance for educating cadres and workers to arm themselves with dialectical materialism, to further understand the laws of revolutionary mass movements and the development of science and technology.

Many workers in Shanghai love Chairman Mao's works and study Chairman Mao's works to such an extent that they keep the books with them, never let them out of their hands, read them early in the morning and late at night, and do not easily let go of even a few minutes of free time. As Marx said more than a hundred years ago: "Philosophy takes the proletariat as its material weapon, and the proletariat takes philosophy as its spiritual weapon." The great Mao Zedong Thought has such a flesh-and-blood connection with the Chinese working class.

The movement of studying Mao Zedong Thought by Shanghai cultural and educational workers is deepening. The broad masses of cultural and educational workers are actively using Mao Zedong Thought as a sharp weapon to transform their world outlook, and have begun to regard Mao Zedong Thought as the only correct guiding ideology for all cultural and educational work. We can see everywhere in universities and colleges that the broad masses of teachers and students are making such efforts to thoroughly destroy idealism, metaphysics, and bourgeois educational thought in various disciplines of philosophy, social sciences, and natural sciences, and firmly establish the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

Arming the broad masses of people with Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly carrying out ideological revolution, thoroughly liberating the broad masses of people from the shackles of bourgeois ideology, and raising the communist consciousness of the broad masses of people will inevitably further clear the way for the rapid development of social productive forces and scientific and cultural undertakings.

The socialist construction of our country is developing at a leap forward speed, and there is an urgent need to popularize the cultural knowledge of the whole people quickly, well, and economically, and to cultivate a theoretical team and a scientific and technological team of the working class. In developing the education cause, we have implemented the Party's "walking on two legs" schooling policy and achieved great victories.

Regarding the policy of "walking on two legs" for developing cultural and educational undertakings, as early as 1944, Chairman Mao gave principled instructions: "In education, there should not only be centralized formal primary and secondary schools, but also decentralized informal village schools, reading groups, and literacy groups." Under the leadership of the Party, Shanghai's full-time primary and secondary schools and industrial and agricultural spare-time education have been greatly developed, especially in the two consecutive years of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959 and the technical revolution movement since this spring, industrial and agricultural spare-time education has been even more developed. The following new situation has now emerged in Shanghai's industrial and agricultural spare-time education: the requirements of the Party, the requirements of the workers and peasants, and the requirements of the cadres have been tightly twisted into one rope, thus creating a thriving scene of the vigorous development of industrial and agricultural spare-time education.

At the beginning of this year, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward to the people of Shanghai the grand task of building Shanghai into one of China's manufacturing bases for high-grade, precision, and cutting-edge products and advanced scientific research, and to cultivate 700,000 scientific and technological cadres within eight years. To realize this task, it is obviously not enough to rely solely on the strength of full-time schools, and industrial and agricultural spare-time education must be carried out on a large scale. Recently, the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee decided to establish a spare-time industrial university; and promoted a number of workers with high political consciousness and mastery of certain cultural and scientific knowledge to be engineers, which is a great encouragement to the broad masses of workers and peasants, and created a very favorable situation for running spare-time education on a large scale.

Under the call of the Municipal Party Committee, the working people of Shanghai have become more eager to learn culture in the upsurge of technical innovation and technical revolution. This is the mass foundation for the rapid development of industrial and agricultural spare-time education. The broad masses of workers compare new technologies and new machines to thoroughbred horses, and believe that without cultural and scientific knowledge, "with a thoroughbred horse, no one can ride it, and even if you ride a thoroughbred horse, you can't run a thousand miles," so "going to work to engage in production, going to school to learn culture, and engaging in innovation after class" has become a trend. Some peasants in the suburbs also insist on learning culture during the busy farming season. In the city, 1.87 million workers and peasants have participated in various levels and types of spare-time school studies. The determination of the Municipal Party Committee and the urgent demands of the masses have greatly inspired the enthusiasm of party organizations and cadres at all levels to run schools. Running spare-time education on a large scale has become a conscious mass movement, and many industrial and agricultural spare-time schools have sprung up like mushrooms after a rain. Some factories have also opened special classes for old workers, recruiting old workers to leave production for several months or to participate in half-work and half-study, because old workers have high political consciousness, rich production experience, and a strong desire to learn, they can quickly cultivate a group of intermediate and senior technical talents, and strengthen the technical force of factories and enterprises. A new situation of factories as schools, schools as factories, and factories as scientific research institutes; and workers as students, students as workers, and workers as scientific researchers has emerged in many units. The method of combining production, education, and scientific research has been greatly developed. The Huguang Scientific Instrument Factory has only more than ninety employees, and also runs a spare-time primary school, a spare-time middle school, and some people participate in spare-time university studies. The workers in this factory have gradually improved their scientific and cultural level by participating in the studies of spare-time schools. In this technical revolution movement, they manufactured twenty-seven kinds of high-grade, precision, and cutting-edge products in more than two months. After spare-time study, young worker Wang Linhe has been able to read several foreign professional books and manufactured the cutting-edge product high-voltage bridge. Recently, many spare-time technical schools and short-term training courses have also been established in the rural areas of Shanghai suburbs. The important role of running industrial and agricultural spare-time education on a large scale in accelerating the growth of technical forces, developing production, and promoting technical revolution is now recognized by more and more cadres, and their original superstitions that there is a lack of time, a lack of teachers, and a lack of equipment, and therefore they dare not let go of running spare-time education on a large scale, have also been shattered.

Because the current spare-time education movement is closely combined with production, the training objectives are clear, the school systems and teaching materials are blooming, and the teaching methods are diverse, breaking through some unrealistic practices in the past industrial and agricultural spare-time education, this is an important factor in promoting the great prosperity of Shanghai's industrial and agricultural spare-time education. Many units have carried out some reforms in the school system, curriculum, teaching materials, and teaching methods, and created some better experiences. Some factories have compiled their own teaching materials by adopting the mass line method according to the needs of their own production. Many industrial and agricultural spare-time schools have tried various methods of combining cultural education and technical education, combining professional knowledge education and basic education, combining short-term shock and systematic study, and combining professional knowledge education first and then comprehensive knowledge education for different educational objects. These methods are more realistic, welcomed by the workers and peasants, and improve the enthusiasm of the workers and peasants to learn. It seems that this kind of spare-time education is not formal, but it is an effective way to accelerate and strengthen the working-class technical team and realize the intellectualization of the workers and peasants.

The Party's policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor is the fundamental policy of socialist education, and it is also the fundamental policy of realizing the laborization of intellectuals. In the past two years, with the implementation of this policy, productive labor has entered the schools, productive labor has become a regular course in the schools, effectively improving the ideological awareness of the broad masses of teachers and students, and promoting the improvement of the quality of education, and the education cause has been given a new look and is full of vitality. The correctness of this policy of the Party has been fully proved in practice. However, some people still have doubts about whether this policy will reduce the quality of education, especially whether it can improve the quality of education. The rich practice of the great technical revolution movement has pushed the implementation of the policy of combining education with productive labor to a new stage. In this movement, 16,000 teachers and students from Shanghai universities and colleges went to factories and rural areas to participate in the technical revolution movement. They integrated with the workers and peasants, further established flesh-and-blood ties, which greatly benefited the transformation of the world outlook of intellectuals. The heroic spirit of the working class in the technical revolution movement of despising all difficulties, daring to think and daring to do, and selfless labor gave the teachers and students an extremely profound education. Many students have also become "innovation fans" in the technical revolution, and in a short period of time, they have put forward more than 30,000 technical innovation proposals, of which more than 6,800 have been adopted. The broad masses of teachers and students plunged into the torrent of the technical revolution, encountered many technical innovation projects that needed to be explained theoretically, which prompted them to use the theory they learned to explain practical problems, and better combine theory and practice, learning and application, and the understanding of theory was also more profound. After returning to school, they immediately brought the communist spirit of daring to think and daring to do, self-reliance, and large-scale collaboration, as well as the practice of combining local and foreign methods, with local methods as the main focus, to the school, and became an extremely active force in scientific research and technical revolution. In just a few months, they have achieved great results in scientific research, updating teaching equipment, and carrying out electrical teaching on a large scale. Scientific and technological activities and electrical teaching in primary and secondary schools are also being widely carried out.

What is particularly important is that the broad masses of teachers and students of universities and colleges personally participated in this great technical revolution movement, not only learned many scientific knowledge that they had not learned in school in the past, but also deeply felt that there are still many outdated, cumbersome, and unrealistic places in the original teaching content of the school; deeply felt the necessity of further carrying out the education revolution, and actively participated in the teaching reform movement.

Teaching reform is the central content of the continued deepening of the current education revolution. In our school teaching, the phenomena of less, slow, poor, and expensive are still very serious. Although the primary and secondary education cause has developed rapidly in recent years, and the quality of teaching has also been greatly improved, the school system is too long, the level is low, the teaching methods are outdated, and the curriculum content also has the problems of repetition, cumbersomeness, and fragmentation. These are not adapted to the requirements of cultivating laborers with socialist consciousness and culture in a faster, better, and more economical way. The situation of sustained leap forward in socialist construction urgently requires changing this situation. Teachers and students of East China Normal University, together with some primary and secondary school educators, under the leadership of the Party, put forward a plan to reform the primary and secondary school system, curriculum content, and teaching methods; and compiled new teaching materials for the ten-year ordinary education system. The Shanghai education community is carrying out a heated discussion on teaching reform. Some kindergartens and primary and secondary schools are also actively carrying out experiments on teaching reform, especially teaching method reform. Comrade Lu Dingyi put forward: in full-time primary and secondary school education, appropriately shorten the years, appropriately improve the level, appropriately control the class hours, and appropriately increase the labor requirements, can be completely achieved through the mass teaching reform movement.

Teaching reform in universities and colleges is also being carried out enthusiastically. The science, engineering, medicine, and agriculture departments of universities and colleges are still unable to adapt to the needs of the development of our country's revolution and construction cause in terms of curriculum system, teaching content, and teaching methods, and cannot reflect the latest achievements of modern science and production technology; there are phenomena of cumbersomeness, complexity, and detachment from reality, wasting a lot of time and energy of teachers and students; and the bourgeois idealism and metaphysical views have not been completely eliminated. In the teaching reform movement, teachers and students of various schools have exposed a large number of problems in this regard, some have adopted the method of combining teachers and students, and have begun to formulate teaching reform plans for various majors, and some majors and departments are looking for and experimenting with ways to thoroughly reform the teaching system, teaching content, and teaching methods, and carry out the education revolution into all aspects of teaching work. Among the teachers and students of liberal arts in universities and colleges, a great debate is being launched on how to cultivate the working class's own red and expert theoretical propaganda workers. This debate raises fundamental issues such as the basic tasks, training objectives, training methods, and training methods of liberal arts. Fudan University put forward three fighting goals for the thorough reform of liberal arts teaching: First, to make the students cultivated by liberal arts truly become the Party's red scholars, become theoretical propaganda cadres who are relatively able to master Mao Zedong Thought, have been tempered by practical struggle, and have investigation, research, and writing abilities; Second, to build the liberal arts departments into a powerful assistant to the Party on the theoretical front, and build them into a combat team and research room for the Party in various fields of academic thought; Third, to establish a liberal arts education system guided by Mao Zedong Thought, compile a complete set of Marxist-Leninist textbooks that combine with the actual situation in China, and train a team of teachers who are both red and expert. This great debate has powerfully promoted the deepening and development of the liberal arts teaching reform movement.

Teaching reform is a profound ideological revolution for the broad masses of teachers and students. There is a struggle between proletarian educational thought and bourgeois educational thought, a struggle between the two methods of more, faster, better, and more economical and less, slower, poorer, and more expensive, and a struggle between advanced and backward, correct and erroneous. It is by no means an easy task to thoroughly eliminate the influence of bourgeois ideology in all fields of education work and break the outdated and stale concepts and old frameworks that have existed for many years. The Party's proposition of education reform has been warmly supported by the majority of teachers and students. Some educators have worked according to the old teaching system, the old teaching content, and the old teaching methods for many years, and it is not easy for them to make a revolutionary leap from bourgeois educational thought to communist educational thought, from old concepts to new concepts. In this teaching reform in Shanghai's schools, the school's party organization and advanced educators have adopted a warm and helping attitude towards them, and encouraged them to participate in the teaching reform together. We have begun to see results in doing so.

Chairman Mao said: "The cultural revolution reflects the political revolution and the economic revolution in the ideological form and serves them." Like the situation in education, the technical revolution movement has also had a profound impact on the development of Shanghai's cultural and artistic and health and sports undertakings. High speed and high standards are the slogans of Shanghai workers making a big noise in the technical revolution; now, this slogan has gradually become the common language of cultural and artistic workers for creation and performance. Many literary and art workers have gone deep into the boiling struggle, no longer as onlookers of the struggle, but as members of the struggle. Their world outlook and their feelings are changing. They demand that creation also be high speed and high standards, actively praise workers, peasants and soldiers, express workers, peasants and soldiers, and serve workers, peasants and soldiers. Since this spring, the creation and performance of songs praising the technical revolution have been greatly improved in terms of both quantity and quality, and some revolutionary literary and artistic works have appeared that conform to the "unity of politics and art, unity of content and form, unity of revolutionary political content and the most perfect artistic form" put forward by Chairman Mao. What is particularly important is that more workers, peasants and soldiers have participated in literary and artistic activities. They are both pioneers of the technical revolution and active literary and artistic fighters. Activities such as poetry contests, song contests, painting contests, play contests, and writing contests are extremely popular among the masses. This kind of activity can not only timely reflect and encourage the struggle of the masses of workers, peasants and soldiers, but also discover excellent works, gradually improve the level of mass literature and art, and promote professional literary and art workers to combine with the masses and draw nourishment from the masses, transform their own thoughts, and improve the level of creation. This kind of activity has become one of the important ways for the Party to lead mass literary and artistic activities. It can be said that holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, resolutely criticizing bourgeois literary and artistic thought, leading and actively developing mass literary and artistic activities, promoting professional literary and artistic workers to actively participate in actual struggle, combine with the masses, and strive to create practice, is the hope for producing great works of our great era, and also an important guarantee for the increasingly prosperous socialist national cultural and artistic undertakings in our country.

Shanghai's health and sports undertakings have entered a new stage with the technical revolution movement, the development of urban and rural people's communes, and the upsurge of widely organizing residents' economic life. Under the leadership of the Party, health work actively serves production and the collective life of residents, and carries out mass movements on a large scale. Significant achievements have been made in a short period of more than a month. Mass sports activities have also been developed, and many advanced units have emerged. Old customs and habits are being replaced by new customs and habits. The people of Shanghai are actively striving to transform Shanghai into a new socialist city where everyone is healthy and the environment is clean in a short period of time.

The cultural revolution of our era is unprecedented in the history of our country. Six hundred and fifty million people must become masters of culture and must build our country a powerful socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. This is a matter of great historical significance.

This great cultural revolution has made great achievements and is still developing. With its development, it will surely achieve even more brilliant achievements. The proletarian revolutionary culture has developed in the struggle against the bourgeois reactionary culture. In today's deepening socialist revolution, it is even more necessary to thoroughly smash the bourgeois culture. We now have a large cultural and educational army led by the Party, with constantly improving awareness, including professional and amateur cultural and educational workers. This army shoulders a glorious mission in the cultural revolution. Educators must be educated. The current excellent situation of the cultural revolution requires the broad masses of cultural and educational workers to more resolutely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, further carry forward the glorious tradition of communist intellectuals during the May Fourth period under the leadership of the Party, conscientiously transform their world outlook, implement the most thorough break with bourgeois ideology, integrate with the broad masses of workers, peasants and soldiers, learn the revolutionary spirit and excellent qualities of the workers, peasants and soldiers, break superstitions, dare to think and dare to do, and be a true proletarian revolutionary. Only in this way can we make greater contributions in realizing the magnificent historical task of laborizing intellectuals, intellectualizing workers and peasants, and building a socialist national new culture, in accelerating socialist construction, and in the great cause of realizing communism in the future.

    上海文化革命的新形势
    中共上海市委候补书记　石西民
    从五四运动到现在整整四十一周年了。
    五四时期所进行的文化革命，在共产主义思想的指导下，以彻底地不妥协地反对帝国主义文化和封建文化为中心，为新民主主义革命作了思想准备。这一文化革命运动给予了我国人民革命事业以巨大的影响，立下了伟大的功劳。五四以来，我国人民的文化革命运动在中国共产党的领导下，一直在不断发展。它在动员广大的中国人民进行民主革命、社会主义革命和社会主义建设中起了重大的作用。今天，又一个更加伟大的文化革命高潮在我们面前出现了。我国现阶段出现的文化革命高潮，是我国人民革命胜利的必然产物，特别是总路线、大跃进和人民公社的必然产物；它具有全新的历史特点：马克思列宁主义普遍真理同中国革命实践相结合的毛泽东思想正在向全民大普及；以多快好省的方法培养社会主义建设人材的教育事业和全面性的技术革命运动正在大发展；工农群众知识化、知识分子劳动化的方针正在胜利地贯彻，劳动人民一定要做文化的主人的愿望正在变为现实；社会主义的、民族的文化艺术事业正在蓬勃发展，群众性的体育卫生事业正在广泛兴起。具有如此丰富内容和广大规模的文化革命运动，是社会主义革命和社会主义建设总战线中的一条重要的战线，是推动和配合工农业生产不断地向前发展的积极力量，是加速我国社会主义建设和将来过渡到共产主义的必要条件。
    上海人民，和全国人民一样，在今年春天掀起的伟大的技术革新和技术革命运动中，不仅显示了征服经济落后的坚强意志、无穷无尽的智慧和力量，而且显示了征服文化落后的迫切愿望和巨大的积极性。蓬蓬勃勃的技术革命运动，既推动了工农业生产的继续跃进，又推动了文化革命的迅速发展。毛主席在中华人民共和国诞生的前夜所作的科学预言：“随着经济建设的高潮的到来，不可避免地将要出现一个文化建设的高潮”，正在实现。在上海，一个新的文化大发展、大普及、大提高的繁荣兴旺的局面，已经开始出现了。
    广大劳动人民自觉地掀起学习毛主席著作的热潮，是目前我国文化革命的最突出的特点。文化革命首先是思想革命。早在民主革命时期，毛主席就明确指示：“当作国民文化的方针来说，居于指导地位的是共产主义的思想，并且我们应当努力在工人阶级中宣传社会主义和共产主义，并适当地有步骤地用社会主义教育农民及其他群众。”随着我国社会主义革命日益深入、社会主义建设飞速发展的新形势的出现，马克思列宁主义大普及、我国当代最伟大的思想——毛泽东思想大普及的局面也就跟着出现。上海工人阶级在这次伟大的技术革命运动中，十分深切地感到，只有以毛泽东思想武装自己，才能成为一个具有雄心大志的人，才能成为一个神通广大的人，才能成为一个敢想敢做的人，才能成为一个不怕困难、征服困难的人，才能创造奇迹。上海广大工人学习毛主席著作的自觉性显著提高，并且掀起了一个群众性的大学理论、大讲理论、大写理论、大用理论的热潮。成百上千的工人以毛泽东思想作指导，写出一批理论文章，在讲坛上宣读，在报刊上发表，在大学里讲课。他们写出的文章具有鲜明的特色：立场坚定，论点鲜明，富有战斗性；包含着丰富而生动的唯物辩证法思想，而且，言之有物，有的放矢。这是上海工人今春以来在学习毛泽东思想运动中出现的新的创举。这一雄辩的事实，使得那些认为工人不能学理论，更不能用理论的陈腐观念进一步地土崩瓦解了。
    广大工人和干部热烈学习毛主席著作，是出于他们在革命和建设实践斗争中的迫切需要。他们不是为学习而学习，而是为了更好地掌握毛泽东思想的武器，来分析工作中的矛盾和存在的困难，找出解决矛盾、克服困难的办法，以推动革命和建设事业的迅速发展。如永安印染厂干部和工人学习了毛主席的“矛盾论”，根据矛盾转化的哲学原理，在这次技术革命中，创造出与原来印染工业中旧工艺截然相反的新工艺，在保证质量的前提下，大大节约了用煤。现在，不少干部和工人，对于技术革命中出现的许多新创造，也开始学会根据毛泽东思想，比较系统地从理论上加以阐明。这对于教育干部和工人用辩证唯物主义把自己武装起来，进一步认识革命群众运动和研究科学技术发展的规律，具有深远的意义。
    上海许多工人热爱毛主席著作，学习毛主席著作，已到了这样的程度：他们书不离身，手不释卷，起早看，落夜看，即使有几分钟的空隙也不轻易放过。正如马克思在一百多年前说的：“哲学把无产阶级当做自己的物质武器，同样地，无产阶级把哲学当做自己的精神武器。”伟大的毛泽东思想，同我国工人阶级就有着这样的血肉联系。
    上海文教工作者学习毛泽东思想运动正在走向深入。广大文教工作者积极地把毛泽东思想当作改造自己世界观的锐利武器，并且开始把毛泽东思想作为一切文教工作的唯一正确的指导思想。我们在高等学校中到处可以看到广大师生在作这样努力，要在哲学、社会科学和自然科学各门学科中，大破唯心主义、形而上学和资产阶级教育思想，牢固地树立毛泽东思想的红旗。
    用毛泽东思想武装广大人民群众，彻底地进行思想革命，彻底地把广大人民群众从资产阶级思想的束缚下解放出来，提高广大人民群众的共产主义觉悟，必将进一步为社会生产力和科学文化事业的迅速发展扫清道路。
    我国社会主义建设以大跃进的速度向前发展，迫切需要多快好省地普及全民的文化知识，培养一支工人阶级的理论队伍和科学技术队伍。在发展教育事业方面，我们贯彻执行了党的“两条腿走路”的办学方针，取得了巨大的胜利。
    关于发展文化教育事业的“两条腿走路”的方针，早在1944年，毛主席就作了原则性的指示：“在教育工作方面，不但要有集中的正规的小学、中学，而且要有分散的不正规的村学、读报组和识字组。”在党的领导下，上海全日制的大中小学和工农业余教育有了很大的发展，特别是1958年和1959年两年连续大跃进和今春以来的技术革命运动，工农业余教育有了更大的发展。上海工农业余教育现在已出现了这样的新形势：党的要求、工农群众的要求、干部的要求已经紧紧地拧成了一股绳，因而出现了工农业余教育蓬勃发展的万紫千红的局面。
    中共上海市委在今年年初向上海人民提出了要把上海建设成为我国制造高级、精密、尖端产品和先进的科学研究基地之一，要在八年内培养七十万科学技术干部的宏伟任务，实现这个任务，单靠全日制学校的力量，显然是不够的，必须大办工农业余教育。最近，上海市人民委员会决定成立业余工业大学；提拔了一批具有高度政治觉悟、掌握一定的文化科学知识的工人为工程师，这对于广大工农群众是一个极大的鼓舞，为大办业余教育创造了十分有利的形势。
    上海工农劳动人民在市委的号召下，在技术革新和技术革命的热潮中，学习文化的要求更加迫切了，这是工农业余教育得以迅速发展的群众基础。广大工人把新技术新机器比作千里马，认为没有文化科学知识是：“有了千里马，没有人能骑，骑上千里马，也跑不到一千里”，因此，“上班搞生产、下班学文化、课后搞革新”已成了风气。郊区一部分农民在农忙季节也坚持学文化。全市工农群众参加各级各类业余学校学习的，已达一百八十七万人。市委的决心，群众的迫切要求，大大激励了各级党组织和广大干部的办学积极性。大办业余教育，已经成了一个自觉的群众运动，许多工农业余学校像雨后春笋般办了起来。有些工厂还开办了老工人特别班，招收老工人脱产几个月或半工半读参加学习，由于老工人政治觉悟高，生产经验丰富，有强烈的学习愿望，可以很快地培养出一批中、高级技术人材，壮大工厂企业的技术力量。又是工厂、又是学校、又是科学研究所；又是工人、又是学生、又是科学研究员的新局面，在许多单位已经出现了。生产、教育和科学研究三结合的方式，有了很大的发展。沪光科学仪器厂只有九十多个职工，也办起了业余小学、中学，还有一部分人参加了业余大学学习，这个工厂的工人参加了业余学校的学习，科学文化水平逐渐提高。他们在这次技术革命运动中，在两个多月时间内，就制造了二十七种高级、精密、尖端产品，青年工人王林鹤经过业余学习，已经能够阅读几种外文专业书籍，制造了尖端产品高压电桥。最近，上海郊区农村也兴办了许多业余技术学校和短期训练班。大办工农业余教育对于加速技术力量的成长，对于发展生产和推动技术革命所起的重要作用，现在已为越来越多的干部所认识，他们原来认为缺少时间、缺少师资、缺少设备，因而不敢放手大办业余教育的种种迷信，也迎刃而破了。
    由于当前的业余教育运动密切结合生产，培养目标明确，学制教材百花齐放，教学方法多种多样，冲破了过去工农业余教育中一些不切实际的做法，这是促使上海工农业余教育大兴旺的重要因素。许多单位在学制、课程、教材和教学方法上，都进行了一些改革，创造了一些较好的经验。有些工厂结合本单位生产需要，采取群众路线的方法，自编教材。许多工农业余学校针对不同教育对象，试验了文化教育和技术教育相结合，专业知识教育和基础教育相结合，短期突击和系统学习相结合，以及先专业知识教育、后综合知识教育等等多种多样的方法。这些方法比较切合实际，受到工农群众的欢迎，提高了工农群众学习的积极性。看起来，这种业余教育好像不正规，其实它是加速和壮大工人阶级技术队伍、实现工农群众知识化的有效办法。
    党的教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合的方针是社会主义教育事业的根本方针，也是实现知识分子劳动化的根本方针。两年来，随着这个方针的贯彻，生产劳动进入了学校，生产劳动成了学校的正课，有效地提高了广大师生的思想觉悟，促进了教育质量的提高，教育事业因之面貌一新，生气勃勃。党的这个方针的正确性，已在实践中得到了充分的证明。但是，这个方针会不会降低教育质量，特别是能不能提高教育质量，有些人还是有怀疑的。伟大的技术革命运动的丰富实践，把教育与生产劳动相结合方针的贯彻推向一个新的阶段。在这个运动中，上海高等学校师生有一万六千人下厂下乡参加技术革命运动。他们和工人农民打成一片，进一步建立了血肉的联系，大大有利于知识分子世界观的改造。工人阶级在技术革命运动中表现出来的那种蔑视一切困难、敢想敢做的英雄气概和忘我的劳动精神，给了师生们极其深刻的教育。不少学生也成了技术革命中的“革新迷”，在短时间内，提出了三万多项技术革新的建议，其中已被采用的有六千八百多项。广大师生投入技术革命的洪流中，遇到了许多技术革新项目需要作理论上的解释，这就促使他们用学到的理论去解释实际问题，把理论和实际、学和用更好地结合起来，对于理论的理解也就更加深刻了。他们在回到学校后，立刻把工人阶级那种敢想敢做、自力更生和大协作的共产主义精神，以及土洋结合、以土为主的作法带到学校中来，成为科学研究和技术革命中的一支极为活跃的力量，在短短数月之内，已经在科学研究、更新教学设备和大搞电化教学等方面，取得了很大的成果。中小学的科学技术活动和电化教学也在广泛开展。
    特别重要的是，大中学校广大师生亲身参加了这个伟大的技术革命运动，不仅学到了许多过去在学校中不曾学到的科学知识，并且深切地感到原来学校中的教学内容还有不少陈旧、繁琐、脱离实际的地方；深切地感到进一步开展教育革命的必要性，积极地投入了教学改革运动。
    教学改革是当前教育革命继续深入的中心内容。在我们学校教学中，少慢差费的现象还十分严重。中小学教育事业，这几年来虽然有了很快的发展，教学质量也有很大的提高，但是学制太长，程度又低，教学方法陈旧，课程内容也存在着重复、繁琐和支离破碎的毛病，这些，都同多快好省地培养有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者的要求不相适应。社会主义建设持续跃进的形势，迫切要求改变这种状况。华东师范大学师生同一部分大中小学教育工作者一起，在党的领导下，提出了一个改革中小学学制、课程内容和教学方法的方案；编写了新的十年制普通教育的教材。上海教育界正在热烈展开教学改革的讨论。一部分幼儿园和中小学也在积极进行教学改革特别是教学方法改革的试验。陆定一同志提出来的：在全日制中小学教育中适当缩短年限、适当提高程度、适当控制学时、适当增加劳动的要求，经过群众性的教学改革运动，是完全可以做到的。
    高等学校的教学改革也在热烈进行。高等学校的理、工、医、农各科，在课程体系、教学内容、教学方法等方面还不能适应我国革命和建设事业发展的需要，不能反映现代科学和生产技术最新成就；存在着繁琐、庞杂和脱离实际的现象，浪费师生大量时间和精力；资产阶级的唯心主义和形而上学的观点还远未肃清。各校师生在教学改革运动中大量地揭发了这方面的问题，有的采取了师生结合的方法，开始制订各种专业的教学改革方案，有的专业和系科正在寻找和试验彻底改革教学体系、教学内容、教学方法的途径，把教育革命深入到教学工作的各个方面去。在高等学校文科的师生中正在展开一场如何培养工人阶级自己的又红又专的理论宣传工作者的大辩论，这场辩论提出了文科的基本任务、培养目标、培养途径和培养方法等根本性问题。复旦大学提出了三个彻底改革文科教学的奋斗目标：一、使文科培养出的学生真正成为党的红色秀才，成为比较能够掌握毛泽东思想，经过实践斗争锻炼，具有调查研究和写作能力的理论宣传干部；二、把文科各系办成党在理论战线上的有力助手，办成党在学术思想各个领域内的战斗队和研究室；三、建立一个以毛泽东思想为指导的文科教育体系，编写出成套马克思列宁主义的、结合中国实际的教材，训练出一支又红又专的教师队伍。这场大辩论，有力地促进了文科教学改革运动的深入和发展。
    教学改革对于广大师生来说，是一场深刻的思想革命。这里有无产阶级教育思想和资产阶级教育思想的斗争，有多快好省和少慢差费两种方法的斗争，有先进和落后、正确和谬误的斗争。要在教育工作的一切领域内彻底清除资产阶级思想的影响，打碎多年来长期存在的过时的陈腐观念和旧框框，决不是一件轻而易举的事情。党的教育改革的主张，已经受到了多数师生的热烈拥护。有一些教育工作者，他们按照旧的教学体系、旧的教学内容、旧的教学方法工作了许多年，要他们从资产阶级教育思想到共产主义教育思想、从旧观念到新观念来一个革命性的飞跃，是不容易的。这次上海各学校在教学改革中，学校的党组织和先进的教育工作者，对他们采取了热情帮助的态度，鼓励他们一道参加教学改革。我们这样做，已开始收到成效。
    毛主席说：“文化革命是在观念形态上反映政治革命和经济革命，并为它们服务的。”同教育方面的情形一样，技术革命运动也给了上海的文化艺术和卫生体育事业的发展以深刻的影响。高速度，高标准，是上海工人大闹技术革命的口号；现在，这个口号也逐渐成为文化艺术工作者进行创作和演出的共同语言。许多文艺工作者深入到沸腾的斗争中，已不再是斗争的旁观者，而是斗争中的一员。他们的世界观，他们的感情正在转变，他们要求创作也要高速度、高标准，积极地歌颂工农兵，表现工农兵，为工农兵服务。今春以来，歌颂技术革命的创作和演出，无论在数量和质量方面，都有不少的提高，出现了一些符合毛主席提出的“政治和艺术的统一，内容和形式的统一，革命的政治内容和尽可能完美的艺术形式的统一”的革命文艺作品。特别重要的是，更多的工农兵群众参加到文艺活动中来了。他们既是技术革命的闯将，又是活跃的文艺战士。赛诗、赛歌、赛画、赛戏、赛文的活动，在群众中极为流行。这种活动，既能及时反映和鼓舞工农兵群众的斗争，又能发现优秀的作品，逐步提高群众文艺的水平，还能促进专业文艺工作者和群众相结合、并从群众中汲取养料，改造自己的思想，提高创作的水平。这种活动已成了党领导群众文艺活动的重要方式之一。可以这样说，高举毛泽东文艺思想的红旗，坚决批判资产阶级文艺思想，有领导地、积极地发展群众文艺活动，促使专业文艺工作者积极参加实际斗争，同群众相结合，并且努力创作实践，这是产生我们这个伟大时代的伟大作品的希望所在，也是我国社会主义的民族的文化艺术事业日益兴旺的重要保证。
    上海的卫生体育事业，随着技术革命运动，随着城乡人民公社的发展以及广泛组织居民经济生活的高潮的到来，已走上了一个新阶段。卫生工作在党的领导下，积极地为生产服务、为居民的集体生活服务，大搞群众运动，已在短短一个多月的时间内，取得了显著的成绩。群众性的体育运动也有了发展，出现了许多先进单位。旧风俗旧习惯正在为新风俗新习惯所代替。上海人民正在积极努力，立志要在不长的时间内，把上海改造成为一个人人健康、环境清洁的社会主义新城市。
    我们时代的文化革命，是我国历史上从来没有过的。六亿五千万人民一定要成为文化的主人，一定要把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义强国，这是具有伟大历史意义的事情。
    这个伟大的文化革命，已经取得了巨大的成就，现在还在继续发展中，而随着它的发展必将取得更加辉煌的成就。无产阶级革命文化是在同资产阶级反动文化的斗争中发展起来的，在社会主义革命日益深入的今天，更必须彻底地粉碎资产阶级文化。我们现在已经有了一支党所领导的、觉悟不断提高的、包括专业和业余文教工作者在内的文化教育大军。这支大军在文化革命中肩负着光荣的使命。教育者必须受教育。当前文化革命的大好形势，要求广大的文教工作者更加坚决地遵循毛主席的教导，在党的领导下，进一步发扬五四时期共产主义知识分子的光荣传统，认真地改造自己的世界观，同资产阶级思想实行最彻底的决裂，同广大的工农兵群众打成一片，学习工农兵群众的革命精神和优秀品质，破除迷信，敢想敢做，做一个真正的无产阶级革命家。只有这样，才能在实现知识分子劳动化，工农群众知识化，以及建设社会主义民族的新文化的宏伟历史任务中，在加速社会主义建设和为将来实现共产主义的伟大事业中作出更大的贡献。
