Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 24th: More than 6,000 people demonstrated at the U.S. Embassy and Kishi Nobusuke's private residence this afternoon, demanding the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and the dissolution of the Diet, and opposing the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.

Among the demonstrators, there were approximately 3,000 Communist Party members and sympathizers, 1,000 Socialist Party members, and 2,000 students.

They departed from near the Diet at 4:00 PM and first demonstrated in front of the U.S. Embassy, then proceeded in batches to Kishi Nobusuke's residence.

The road in front of Kishi Nobusuke's residence was filled with demonstrators holding banners and chanting slogans. The demonstrators continued a wave-like demonstration there for four hours, shouting "Dissolve the Diet!" and "Kishi Nobusuke, you should resign immediately!" The demonstrators only began to disperse at 9:00 PM in the evening.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 24th: Two thousand five hundred Japanese scholars, cultural leaders, and many students held a demonstration march on the streets of Tokyo today, demanding the dissolution of the Diet and the collective resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, and opposing the ratification of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." The demonstrating masses submitted petitions to the Diet.

Fifty representatives of the demonstrators also explained the reasons for their demands to representatives of the Socialist Party, Communist Party, and Liberal Democratic Party at the Diet building.

Prior to this demonstration march, more than 2,500 university professors and cultural figures held a conference at the Kanda Education Hall in Tokyo this afternoon, demanding the collective resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and the dissolution of the Diet; and announced that Japanese cultural figures do not recognize the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" "passed" by the House of Representatives.

This was the largest gathering of its kind held by Japanese professors. Professors from twenty universities packed the conference hall, which usually only accommodates five hundred listeners. Many students also came to attend the gathering, but could not enter the conference hall, crowding in the corridors and next to the stairs outside.

Nakajima Kenzo told the audience that the urgent task of the Japanese people at present is to dissolve the Diet before the new "Security Treaty" "automatically comes into effect" thirty days after being forcibly "passed" in the House of Representatives. Nakajima Kenzo also pointed out that the current Japanese political situation is at a very serious stage.

Abe Tomoji, Kamei Katsuichiro, Sugimura Haruko, Uehara Seiroku, and Takizawa Osamu, among other famous cultural figures, also spoke at the gathering.

The famous painter Inoue Chozaburo, representing the artists, reported on the artists' unwavering struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. He announced a statement passed by the artists, stating that building "barricades in front of the Prime Minister's residence with taxpayers' money is an insult to the Japanese people. This shows that the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet regards the people as enemies."

Representatives of the Japan Musicians Association and the Music Critics Club also presented resolutions passed by their respective organizations opposing the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

Shiota, representing all professors and associate professors of Tokyo Metropolitan University, emphasized that cultural leaders must cooperate with workers to launch a struggle against the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

He pointed out that university professors should step out of their ivory towers and engage in various concrete activities, such as distributing leaflets or speaking to the public on the streets.

Shiota emphasized, "We must also raise our voices against President Eisenhower's scheduled visit to Japan."

The meeting passed a resolution condemning Kishi Nobusuke for forcing the Diet to "pass" the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," grossly trampling on the parliamentary system. The resolution said that anyone who helps Kishi Nobusuke should be considered as stifling democracy and should be condemned.

Xinhua News Agency, May 24th: The Japanese Communist Party's newspaper "Red Flag" published an editorial today, emphasizing the importance of the working class's political strike, pointing out that this is the most effective way to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and dissolve the Diet.

The editorial pointed out that the Kishi Nobusuke government, disregarding the public's unprecedentedly rising protests against his violent actions, is wholeheartedly trying to salvage the current chaotic situation in favor of the ruling party with the help of U.S. imperialism, without giving up power. They are attempting to convene a three-party leaders' meeting in order to force the opposition party to compromise, while allowing the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" to naturally take effect thirty days after its so-called "approval" by the House of Representatives.

The editorial said that the people now hope that the Socialist Party, Communist Party, and all other democratic forces in the Diet will oppose any compromise and resist any activity in the Diet, taking vigorous action to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke government and dissolve the Diet. They also hope that the working class will take decisive action to finally strike the now isolated Kishi Nobusuke group.

The editorial welcomed the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan's (Sohyo) decision that workers belonging to Sohyo will change their method of action from petitions to strikes in order to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke government and dissolve the Diet.

The editorial said that in addition to deciding to hold a thirty-minute strike on May 26th, Sohyo workers are also preparing to launch a one-hour strike at the beginning of next month. The editorial called on workers from the Federation of Independent Unions and workers belonging to the All-Japan Trade Union Conference, etc., to participate in this action.

The editorial expressed its belief that Sohyo's decision will be supported by all workers belonging to other trade union federations.

The editorial said that ordinary workers all hope to receive strike instructions from their trade union headquarters. This shows that the workers now firmly hope to carry out a strike to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and dissolve the Diet.

The editorial continued, the Japanese people are now outraged by Kishi Nobusuke and are determined to force the ruling class to accept their solution. If the workers resolutely carry out a large-scale strike at this stage, the broad masses of people will certainly support their strike. Workers are now able to encourage the people with a powerful strike. The editorial said that this political strike "will be the main pillar of all other forms of protest—such as petitions, signature campaigns, and street demonstrations, etc."

The editorial said that all party organizations and party institutions at all levels should now provide workers with all kinds of assistance so that they can carry out this great political strike. (Attached picture)

    坚决不承认非法“通过”的日美军事同盟条约
    东京人民继续示威要岸信介立即下台
    “赤旗报”指出政治罢工是当前斗争最有效的办法
    新华社24日讯　东京消息：今天下午有六千多人到美国大使馆和岸信介的私人住宅举行示威，要求岸信介内阁下台和解散国会，反对日美军事同盟条约。
    在示威者中，有共产党员和党的同情者约三千人、社会党员一千人和学生二千人。
    他们在下午四时从国会附近出发，先在美国大使馆前面举行示威，然后一批一批地到达岸信介的住宅。
    岸信介住宅前面的路上站满了高举横幅标语和高呼口号的示威者。示威者继续不断地在那里进行了四小时的波浪形示威，高呼“解散国会”、“岸信介，你应当立即辞职”。示威者直到晚间九时才开始散开。
    据新华社24日讯　东京消息：二千五百名日本学者、文化界领袖和许多学生今天在东京的大街上举行示威游行，要求解散国会和岸信介内阁总辞职，反对批准新日美“安全条约”。示威群众到国会递交了请愿书。
    示威者的五十名代表还在国会大厦对社会党、共产党和自由民主党的代表们叙述了他们提出这些要求的理由。
    在这次示威游行之前，二千五百多名大学教授和文化界人士下午在东京神田教育会馆举行大会，要求岸信介内阁总辞职，解散国会；并宣布日本文化界人士不承认众议院所“通过”的新日美“安全条约”。
    这是日本教授们所举行的规模最大的一次这种性质的集会。来自二十个大学的教授挤满了通常只能容纳五百名听众的会议厅。还有许多学生也来参加集会，但是无法进入会议厅，他们挤在外面的过道里和楼梯旁边。
    中岛健藏向听众说，日本人民当前的紧急任务是，在新“安全条约”在众议院被强行“通过”后三十天内“自动生效”以前，解散国会。中岛健藏并指出，目前日本政局处于十分严重的时期。
    在集会上讲话的还有阿部知二、龟井胜一郎、杉村春子、上原青禄和泷泽修等文化界著名人士。
    著名画家井上长三郎代表艺术家们报告了艺术家坚持不渝地为反对日美军事同盟条约而进行的斗争。他宣布了艺术家们所通过的一项声明，声明说，用纳税人的钱在首相官邸面前修建“街垒，是对日本人民的侮辱。这表明岸信介内阁把人民看作是敌人。”
    日本音乐家协会和音乐评论家俱乐部的代表们，也提出了各自的组织所通过的反对新日美“安全条约”的决议。
    盐田代表东京都立大学全体教授和副教授讲话时强调指出，文化界领袖们必须同工人合作展开反对新日美“安全条约”的斗争。
    他指出，大学教授们应该走出他们的象牙之塔而从事各种各样的具体活动，如散发传单或在街上向公众讲话。
    盐田强调说，“我们也必须发出我们的声音，反对艾森豪威尔总统预定访问日本之行”。
    会议通过决议，谴责岸信介强使国会“通过”新日美“安全条约”，粗暴地践踏了议会制度。决议说，凡是帮助岸信介的人，都应该被认为是扼杀民主而受到谴责。
    新华社24日讯　日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”今天发表社论，强调指出工人阶级政治罢工的重要性，指出这是当前推翻岸信介内阁和使国会解散的最有效的办法。
    社论指出，岸信介政府不顾公众对他的空前强暴行动迅速高涨的抗议，正在美帝国主义者的帮助下，一心一意地想要挽回目前的混乱局面，使之有利于执政党，而不放弃政权。他们企图召开三党领袖会议以便迫使反对党妥协，同时使新日美“安全条约”在众议院所谓“批准”三十天以后自然而然生效。
    社论说，现在人民群众希望社会党、共产党和其它所有国会民主力量反对任何妥协，并抵制国会的任何活动，采取有力的行动来推翻岸信介政府，使国会解散。他们还希望工人阶级采取决定性的行动，来最后打击现在已经陷入孤立的岸信介集团。
    社论欢迎日本工会总评议会（总评）关于“总评”所属的工人为了推翻岸信介政府和解散国会，将把他们的行动方式从请愿改变为罢工的决定。
    社论说，“总评”的工人除了决定在5月26日举行三十分钟罢工外，还准备在下月初发动一小时的罢工。社论号召独立工会联合会的工人和全日本工会会议所属的工人等都参加这一行动。
    社论表示相信，“总评”的决定将获得其他工会联合会所属全体工人的支持。
    社论说，一般工人都希望获得他们工会总部的罢工指示。这表明，工人现在坚决希望进行罢工来推翻岸信介内阁和解散国会。
    社论继续说，日本人民现在对岸信介感到愤慨，并且决心迫使统治阶级接受他们的解决办法。如果工人在这个阶段坚决地进行大规模罢工，广大群众将肯定会支持他们的罢工。工人现在能够以强有力的罢工来鼓励人民。社论说，这种政治罢工“将是一切其他形式的抗议——如请愿、征集签名运动和在街上示威等等——的主要支柱。”
    社论说，一切党组织和各级党机构现在应该向工人提供各种帮助以便能够进行这种伟大的政治罢工。（附图片）
