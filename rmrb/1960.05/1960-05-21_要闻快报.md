    Rural canteens in Guizhou vigorously develop family businesses
    While focusing on current summer harvesting and rice transplanting, rural people's communes in Guizhou are vigorously developing canteen family businesses. By early May, over 99% of the more than 100,000 rural canteens across the province had established vegetable production bases and planted vegetables. Canteens in various regions have also planted large quantities of chili peppers, soybeans, miscellaneous beans, melons, and feed on the edges of fields. Over 79% of the canteens in the province raise pigs, with the total number of pigs raised currently 54% higher than in early March. The number of chickens, ducks, and other poultry raised by canteens has also increased by 163% compared to early March. Many canteens have also established year-round or seasonal non-staple food processing organizations, using vegetables and wild plants to process starch, dried vegetables, pickles, and pickled vegetables to meet the needs of commune members.

    Aohan Banner sheep farm sets new record for sheep breeding
    Employees of the Aohan Banner Sheep Breeding Farm in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, this year, from the farm's four thousand eligible ewes, successfully raised five thousand four hundred and ninety-six lambs, achieving a breeding survival rate of 137.4%, breaking their record of 132.2% set last year.

    Jiangjin County comprehensively promotes earthen steam cooking
    Jiangjin County, Sichuan Province, is comprehensively promoting the use of earthen steam for cooking. Within ten days, over six thousand of the county's more than nine thousand rural public canteens had achieved earthen steam cooking. Using earthen steam for cooking can save fuel, labor, and time. For example, the sixty-one canteens of the Gaoya People's Commune originally used 14,000 catties of coal per day. After switching to earthen steam, the coal consumption was reduced to 6,900 catties. Originally, burning coal for cooking took over an hour per meal, but after switching to steam, it only takes fifty minutes. Using steam for cooking not only saves coal and a significant amount of labor for transporting coal, but also greatly reduces the workload of cooks.

    Xingnong Commune vigorously develops comprehensive utilization of agricultural products
    Xingnong People's Commune in Baiquan County, Heilongjiang Province, is vigorously developing comprehensive processing and utilization of agricultural and sideline products. The commune has now established 217 small factories for making wine, potash, starch, soy sauce, and vinegar. These factories use various agricultural by-products to produce large quantities of food, industrial raw materials, and livestock feed. For example, bran, corn cobs, and frozen potatoes are first used to make sugar or extract starch, then used to make wine and vinegar, and the remaining residue is good feed. This commune produces over fifty types of products, with a total output value of three million yuan in April.

      Extracting oil from rapeseed pods and stalks
    The Anshun City Oil Extraction Plant in Guizhou Province has successfully extracted oil from rapeseed pods and stalks, which can be used for edible, lighting, and industrial purposes. The remaining oilseed cake is also a good feed for pigs. Extracting oil from rapeseed pods and stalks was successfully tested by employees of the Anshun City Oil Extraction Plant with the help of the Industrial and Transportation Work Department of the CPC Anshun Prefectural Committee and the Anshun Prefectural Grain Bureau. The method of extracting oil is roughly the same as extracting oil from rapeseed, that is, chopping the pods and stalks finely, stir-frying them until dry, grinding them into powder, sieving them through a fine sieve, adding 50 to 70 catties of water per 100 catties, and steaming them in a large steamer. After steaming, immediately wrap the cake, press, and squeeze out the crude oil, which can be refined to obtain pure oil.

    Oil and fat factory has wide range of comprehensive utilization
    In the midst of the mass technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the oil and fat processing plants in Harbin have launched a new upsurge in the comprehensive utilization of by-products, achieving multiple uses for one thing and multiple functions for one factory. The Harbin Oil and Fat Plant uses sunflower seed shells, sunflower seed cake, and rice bran cake to make activated carbon, furfural, acetic acid, and over ten other chemical raw materials; it also makes soy sauce, maltose, soap, and white wine. The Acheng Oil Plant also extracts crude oil from soybean stalks; soybean stalk cake can also be processed to produce soy sauce or used as livestock feed.

    贵州农村食堂大搞家底生产
    贵州各地农村人民公社在抓紧当前夏收、栽秧等各项农活的同时，大搞食堂家底生产。到5月上旬，全省十万多个农村食堂，99％以上建立了蔬菜生产基地，并种上了蔬菜。各地食堂还在田边地角种植了大量的辣椒、黄豆、杂豆、瓜类和饲料。全省79％以上的食堂养了猪，目前养猪总数已比3月上旬增加54％；食堂养的鸡鸭等家禽也比3月上旬增加了163％。许多食堂还建立了常年或季节性的副食品加工组织，利用蔬菜和野生植物加工成淀粉、干菜、酱菜、泡菜等，满足社员生活需要。
    敖汉旗羊场创绵羊繁殖新纪录
    内蒙古自治区敖汉旗绵羊繁殖场职工，今年从全场四千只适龄母羊中，保育成活了五千四百九十六只羊羔，繁殖成活率高达137.4％，突破了他们去年创造的繁殖成活率132.2％的纪录。
    江津县全面推广土蒸汽做饭
    四川省江津县全面推广使用土蒸汽做饭，在十天时间内，全县九千多个农村公共食堂，就有六千多个实现了土蒸汽化。利用土蒸汽做饭，可以节省燃料、节省劳力和节省时间。如高牙人民公社的六十一个食堂，原来每天用煤一万四千斤，改用土蒸汽后，用煤量减少到六千九百斤。原来烧煤做饭，一顿饭要用一个多钟头，改用蒸汽后，只要五十分钟。用蒸汽做饭，不仅少用煤，可以节省大量运煤的人力，而且炊事员的劳动量也减少很多。
    兴农公社大搞农产品综合利用
    黑龙江省拜泉县兴农人民公社大搞农副产品综合加工综合利用。全社现已办起制酒、钾盐、淀粉、酱醋等小型工厂二百一十七处。这些工厂利用各种农业副产品，生产出大量的食品、工业原料和牲畜饲料。如用糠麸、玉米芯子和冻土豆等，先制糖或提取淀粉，再做酒和醋，剩下的渣子又是好饲料。这个公社生产出五十多种产品，四月份生产总值达三百万元。
      用油菜荚、秆榨油
    贵州省安顺市榨油厂利用油菜荚和油菜秆，榨出了可供食用、照明和工业用油；剩余的油饼还是养猪的好饲料。利用油菜荚、秆榨油，是安顺市榨油厂职工，在中共安顺地委工业交通工作部和安顺专署粮食局的帮助下，试验成功的。榨油的方法与用油菜籽榨油大体相同，即将荚、秆铡细炒干，碾成粉末，用细筛筛过，每百斤掺水五十斤至七十斤，放在大甑内蒸。蒸好后，立即包饼、压榨、榨出的毛油经过提炼就能取得净油。
