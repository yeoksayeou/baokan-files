    Yan Shuanzhu Has Exceeded the "Hundred Ewes, Hundred Lambs" Target for His Sheep Flock for Six Consecutive Years
    Inner Mongolia Daily Reporter Qi Xingbao
    Yan Shuanzhu, the livestock director of the Dukou Brigade of the Xingfu People's Commune in the suburban area of Bayangaole City, Bayannur League, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, has been diligently participating in and leading production for six years. Since 1955, the sheep flock he has been responsible for has exceeded the "Hundred Ewes, Hundred Lambs" high-yield record for six consecutive years. Over the six years, a total of 658 ewes of breeding age have produced 722 lambs, all of which have survived and are strong. Under his leadership, the brigade increased its livestock from 1,800 head in 1955 to 5,407 head in 1959 (during which period over 2,000 head were also sold), representing a total increase of more than threefold and a net increase of twofold in four years. He has become a red banner bearer on the livestock front in Inner Mongolia.
    Yan Shuanzhu is 42 years old this year. From the age of six, he herded sheep for landlords, enduring beatings and mistreatment, living a life worse than that of a beast of burden for decades. It was not until after liberation that he was emancipated and began to live a happy life. Therefore, he loves the new society, listens to the Party in everything, and works diligently. Due to his outstanding achievements in production, he has been successively named a labor model and advanced producer of the former Dengkou County, Bayannur League, and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region; in 1958, he gloriously joined the Communist Party of China.
                  Leaving Difficulties to Oneself
    In the winter of 1955, when the advanced agricultural cooperative (now Dukou Brigade) was established in Yan Shuanzhu's area, it had 1,800 head (or units) of livestock. At the time of the specific task assignment, some herders felt that there were many weak and thin sheep in their flocks and feared they would not be able to complete the task. Yan Shuanzhu thought, "As the captain, I should take on the difficulties." So, encouraged by the Party branch secretary, he bravely picked out all the 200 or so weak and thin sheep and formed another flock, which he was responsible for herding.
    As the cold winter approached, the flock of thin sheep under Yan Shuanzhu's care faced a severe test. In order to seize the opportunity to fatten the sheep as much as possible, during the day he drove this group of sheep, which were wobbling as they walked, to graze in sunny, sheltered areas where bitter bean grass and artemisia grew, spreading the sheep out to graze slowly and continuously. At midday, when they drank water, some old sheep were afraid of the cold and dared not stretch their mouths, so he rolled up his sleeves and put his arm into the icy trough to stir the water and encourage the sheep to drink. At night, he got up five or six times to feed the sheep extra hay. Some older sheep that were too thin refused to eat more at night, so he tried to drive them out of the pen to move around before feeding them fodder and grass. He also repaired and reinforced the sheepfolds overnight. In just fifty days, most of the sheep had gained weight. In order to ensure reproduction, he supplemented the ewes as soon as they began to gain weight, ensuring that all 129 ewes of breeding age became pregnant. The following year, 135 lambs were born, all of which survived. This created a new record of complete mating, complete pregnancy, complete birth, complete survival, and complete health for thin sheep.
    After the establishment of the commune in the autumn of 1958, Yan Shuanzhu became the livestock captain of the brigade. When re-organizing the flocks, he once again formed a flock of all the thin sheep and took charge of them. Now, this flock has become the one with the best condition and the most lambs in the entire brigade. Under the influence of his noble style, all the herders in the brigade are very motivated. Herders Wang Gaoxin, Chen Genggeng, Zhang Qizi, Zhou Tougao, Ma Surong, and others also carefully herded and improved their techniques, achieving "Hundred Ewes, Hundred Lambs."
                   Selflessness for the Public Good
    Regarding the commune as home and selflessness for the public good are other characteristics of Comrade Yan Shuanzhu. In the spring of 1957, Yan Shuanzhu's stomach ailment and arthritis, which he had contracted during his difficult life in the old society, relapsed. The leaders of the cooperative repeatedly urged him to seek treatment. At this time, the lambs developed an epidemic. Yan Shuanzhu believed that his illness was an old one and it would not matter if he saw a doctor a few days later, but the lambs could not be delayed. He dismissed the idea of going to the hospital and used the money he had saved for medicine to personally prepare medicine for the lambs, enduring his own pain to treat the lambs, finally curing them. Yan Shuanzhu, who is loyal to the cause of socialist construction and loves the commune like his home, has often used his own money to buy medicine for the cooperative's sheep and feed the lambs with his own cooking oil and flour over the years, without ever telling anyone.
    This spring, due to the large number of second-crop lambs, the brigade did not have enough fodder. Yan Shuanzhu quietly used his own 30 yuan to buy fodder. After everyone found out about this, they recently reimbursed him for the money.
    Humbly Learning, Daring to Think and Act
    Comrade Yan Shuanzhu has rich experience himself, and also often humbly learns from others, especially actively taking the lead in promoting some new technologies. In 1958, when he first heard about the benefits of improving sheep breeds at the League's Labor Model Conference, he resolved to promote the experience of sheep breed improvement. The Party branch actively supported his plan. He went to the sheep breeding station to invite inseminators and personally drove over the breeding rams. Some herders did not believe in artificial insemination, so Yan Shuanzhu did propaganda while inseminating more than 130 sheep in his own flock at once, thus dispelling the herders' concerns. That year, they improved more than 520 sheep.
    During the Great Leap Forward, Yan Shuanzhu actively responded to the Party's call, broke down superstitions, and emancipated his mind. He pondered, "Sheep can produce a litter of lambs in five months. Is it possible for them to have two litters a year? Someone at the Labor Model Conference said that blood mating could be done for cattle and horses, so why not sheep?" He first selected two ewes for experimentation, and it was indeed successful. Then, he used the facts to promote this to the herders. With the support of the Party branch, it was promoted throughout the brigade from the end of October 1959, and more than 700 sheep were blood-mated, finding a new way for the entire team to achieve "Hundred Ewes, Hundred Lambs."
               Rich Experience in Grazing Management
    Comrade Yan Shuanzhu has accumulated a whole set of experiences in grazing, feeding, pregnancy protection, and lamb protection. Someone once compiled his winter grazing experience into the following rhyme: "Leave the group at the red of the east, find shelter from the wind in the sun, scatter like stars across the sky, the herder is the vanguard; add more grass at night when it's cold, relieving hunger and resisting the cold, ensuring the condition of the ewe and fetus, and making it through the winter without danger."
    Comrade Yan Shuanzhu has rich grazing experience, can treat livestock diseases, and also has a set of methods for preventing livestock epidemics. His method for preventing sheep diseases is four observations and one check: observe their lying posture early in the morning, observe their gait when leaving the flock, observe changes in their feces and urine, observe their grazing while herding; after entering the pen, check for any signs of sheep lying in piles, discover the illness in time, and treat it as soon as possible.
    Because of his meticulous care for livestock, both large and small sheep are raised to be fat and strong.

### 阎拴柱连续六年超额完成羊群“百母百仔”

    阎拴柱连续六年超额完成羊群“百母百仔”
    内蒙古日报记者　齐星宝
    内蒙古自治区巴彦淖尔盟巴彦高勒市郊区幸福人民公社渡口大队牧业主任阎拴柱，参加生产领导生产，勤勤恳恳，六年如一日。他所包放的羊群，从1955年以来连续六年超额完成了“百母百仔”高产纪录。六年总计有适龄母羊六百五十八只，共产仔七百二十二只，羊羔只只全活全壮。他领导的这个大队，1955年有牲畜一千八百头，到1959年已增殖到五千四百零七头（这期间还出卖了二千多头），四年总增三倍多，纯增两倍。他成了内蒙古畜牧业战线上的一名红旗手。
    阎拴柱今年四十二岁。从六岁起，他就给地主放羊，挨打受气，度过几十年牛马不如的生活，直到解放后他才翻了身，过上幸福生活。因此他热爱新社会，事事听党的话，埋头苦干。由于他生产上成绩卓著，曾先后被评为原磴口县、巴彦淖尔盟和内蒙古自治区的劳动模范与先进生产者；1958年，他光荣地参加了中国共产党。
                  把困难留给自己
    1955年冬，阎拴柱所在的地方建成高级农业社时（即现在的渡口大队），入社牲畜一千八百头（只）。当时全社共分了八群羊，在具体分派任务时，有些放牧员觉得自己群里的瘦弱羊多，怕完不成任务。阎拴柱想：“自己是队长，应当把困难承担起来”。于是，在党支部书记的鼓励下，他勇敢的把所有的二百来只瘦弱羊都挑了出来，另编了一个群，由自己负责放牧。
    当寒冬将要来临的时候，阎拴柱包放的这群瘦羊，面临着一场严酷的考验。为了尽可能地抓紧时机让羊上膘，白天他赶着这群走路还打晃的羊，选择向阳避风和生长苦豆草、艾蒿草的地方放牧，把羊疏散开，一边慢慢走，一边不停地多吃些草。午间饮水时，有些老羊怕冷不敢伸嘴，他就挽起袖子把手臂伸入冰冷的水槽里搅动，引羊喝水。夜间他还起来五、六次，给羊贴喂夜草。有些过于瘦弱的老羊，夜间不肯多吃，他就想办法赶出圈外活动后，再给喂料喂草。他还连夜赶修加固棚圈。这样仅仅五十来天，大部分的羊都上膘了。为了确保繁殖，他见到那只母羊先上膘，就先给那只羊补配，使一百二十九只适龄母羊都怀了胎。隔年产羔一百三十五只，全部成活。创造了瘦羊全配、全怀、全生、全活、全壮的新纪录。
    1958年秋成立公社后，阎拴柱担任了大队的牧业队长。在重新编群时，他再一次把所有的瘦羊编成一群，由自己包放。如今这群羊又成了全大队膘情最好、产羔最多的一群。在他的这种高尚风格的影响下，全大队的放牧员个个干劲很足。放牧员王高信、陈耿耿、张七子、周头高、马素荣等十一人，也都精心放牧，提高技术，实现了“百母百仔”。
                   舍己为公
    以社为家，舍己为公，是阎拴柱同志的又一特点。1957年春天，阎拴柱在旧社会困苦生活中得的胃病和关节炎又犯了。社的领导同志再三劝他去治疗。恰在这个时候，羔羊发生了疫病。阎拴柱认为，自己的病是老病，迟看几天不要紧，这群羊羔可不能耽搁。他打消了去医院的主意，并把自己买药治病的钱拿出来，亲自配制了治羊羔的药，忍着自己的病痛，给羊羔治病，终于把羔羊治好了。对社会主义建设事业忠心耿耿，爱社如家的阎拴柱，几年来常常自己拿钱给社里的羊买药，用自己的食油、面粉喂养羔羊，从来也没向别人说过。
    今年入春后，由于二茬羔多，大队的饲草不够了。阎拴柱又不声不响地用自己的三十多元钱买了饲草。这事被大家知道后，最近补还了他这笔钱。虚心学习　敢想敢干
    阎拴柱同志自己有丰富的经验，还经常虚心地向别人学习，尤其是对一些新技术，更是积极带头推广。1958年，他在盟劳模大会上头一次听到改良绵羊的好处，就下决心要推广绵羊改良经验。党支部积极支持他的计划。他跑到绵羊改良配种站请来配种员，又亲自赶来种公羊。有些放牧员不相信人工配种，阎拴柱一边作宣传，一边在自己包放的羊群里一次就配了一百三十多只，因而打消了放牧员的顾虑。这年他们共改良五百二十多只羊。
    在大跃进中，阎拴柱积极响应党的号召，破除迷信，解放思想，他琢磨：“羊五个月就可下一茬羔，可不可以让它一年下两茬羔？劳模会上曾有人说过牛马可以进行血配，羊为什么不行？”他首先选择了两只母羊进行试验，果然成功。接着他就用事实向放牧员们宣传。在党支部的支持下，从1959年10月末在全大队推广，血配了七百多只，为全队牲畜实现“百母百仔”找到了新途径。
               放牧管理经验丰富
    阎拴柱同志已积累了一整套放牧、饲养、保胎、保羔的经验。有人曾把他冬季放牧的经验编成这样的顺口溜：“出群东方红，向阳找避风，散布满天星，牧工当先锋；夜寒多贴草，解饿又抗寒，膘胎保得住，过冬没危险。”
    阎拴柱同志有丰富的放牧经验，又会给牲畜治病，而且还有一套预防牲畜疫病的办法。他预防羊病的方法是四看一查：早起看卧，出群看走路，看粪尿变化，放牧看吃草；入圈后检查有无卧垛现象，及时发现病情及早治疗。
    由于他对牲畜这样细心照顾，所以无论大羊、小羊，个个都养得膘肥体壮。
