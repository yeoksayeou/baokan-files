Xinhua News Agency, 16th dispatch from Washington: The White House announced on the 14th that U.S. President Eisenhower had signed a bill extending the U.S. "Export Control Act," which was due to expire on June 30th of this year, for another two years. This act stipulates trade restrictions on the Soviet Union and Eastern European socialist countries and implements an "embargo" on China.

This action taken by the U.S. President on the eve of the Four-Power Summit Conference is regarded as another manifestation of the U.S.'s insistence on continuing to pursue the "Cold War" policy.

    美国坚持冷战政策又一罪证
    艾森豪威尔延长敌视社会主义国家的“出口控制法”
    新华社16日讯　华盛顿消息：白宫14日宣布，美国总统艾森豪威尔已经签署了把今年6月30日期满的美国“出口控制法”延长两年的法案。这个法案规定对苏联和东欧社会主义国家实行贸易限制，并对中国实行“禁运。”
    美国总统在四国政府首脑会议前夕采取的这一行动，被认为是美国坚持继续推行“冷战”政策的又一表现。
