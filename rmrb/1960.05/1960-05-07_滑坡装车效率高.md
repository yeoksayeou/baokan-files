    High Efficiency Slope Loading

    The imbalance between production and transportation, with more production than transportation, has long been a key problem at the Yingguan Coal Mine in Yangquan City. Recently, after diligently studying and researching and "learning from experience" elsewhere, they created a semi-walled slope loading method. This involves building a semi-walled slope coal bunker next to the railway. Usually, the coal is stored inside the bunker. When a train arrives beneath the bunker, the gate is pulled, and the stored coal automatically flows into the train cars. It only takes sixty people two minutes to fill thirty-seven cars. In the past, loading such a trainload of coal required at least four hundred and fifty people for three to four hours. As a result, vehicle turnaround has been greatly accelerated, production has been promoted, and the cost per ton of coal has been reduced by 43.7%.

    滑坡装车效率高
    产运不平衡，产得多，运得少，是阳泉市荫管煤矿长期存在的关键问题。最近他们苦钻苦研和到外地“取经”后创造了半壁式滑坡装车法。就是在铁路旁修建一座半壁滑坡式煤仓，平时把煤储在煤仓内，待列车开到煤仓下，把闸板一拉，存煤就自动流入车箱，只需六十人操作两分钟，就可装满三十七个车皮。过去装这样一列车煤，至少需四百五十人装三、四个小时。这样一来，大大加速了车辆周转，促进了生产的提高，并且使每吨煤的成本降低了43.7％。
