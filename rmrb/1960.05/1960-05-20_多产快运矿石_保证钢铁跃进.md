　　Produce More and Quickly Transport Ore to Guarantee a Leap Forward in Steel
Xinhua News Agency, Jinan Electric: The mine system of Shandong Province, which is rich in iron ore resources, has launched a new upsurge of technological transformation to ensure the fulfillment of the "Cultivate for Three Years, Surplus for One" requirement proposed by the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China. It aims to ensure that the ore output in the three months before the rainy season not only meets the needs of blast furnace smelting but also provides blast furnaces with a one-month reserve. By the end of April, the average iron production unit in the province had an ore reserve of 4.7 days. Since entering May, the ore reserves have continued to increase. Many blast furnaces have changed the past situation of "eating" ore as soon as it arrives and have begun to have reserves.
　　Since March, the scale of technological transformation in the mine system has been expanding step by step, and the effect has become increasingly significant. The national red flag unit, Yantai Xiangshan Iron Mine, has rapidly increased the degree of mechanization mainly through indigenous methods. At present, it has a considerable number of winches, iron and wooden mine cars, air compressors, and indigenous drilling machines, as well as overhead cableways, wooden tracks, and wind drills and wind picks. It has also fully realized hopper loading, landslide transportation, and automatic circular track transportation, thereby greatly changing the face of the enterprise. Most of the workers have put down heavy manual labor tools such as hand hammers. The mining work efficiency has increased from 0.7 tons to 2.8 tons, and the stripping work efficiency has increased from 3.05 cubic meters to 4.5 cubic meters. As a result, the production plans for the first quarter and April of this year were overfulfilled, the amount of ore mined back was increased to be sufficient for three months of mining, and 389 workers were saved.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu Electric: Sichuan Province is vigorously grasping the technological transformation of mines to increase the output of iron ore. The province's ore output in the first quarter increased by 30.8% compared with the same period last year, and the average daily output in April increased by 29.5% compared with the first quarter. Many iron smelting enterprises have already made it possible for blast furnaces to eat their fill, eat well, and have surplus grain.
　　At the beginning of this year, according to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, while vigorously improving the production level of blast furnaces, iron smelting enterprises at all levels organized forces to carry out mine transformation, carried out technological innovation and technological revolution centered on semi-mechanization and mechanization, and improved ore output. In the process of transforming mines, all localities adhered to the principle of relying mainly on indigenous methods, combining indigenous and foreign methods, adapting to local conditions, and relying on self-reliance to achieve low cost, rapid progress, and great results. More than 30% of the 100 key mines transformed in the first quarter have achieved soil mechanization and semi-mechanization in mining and excavation; more than 80% of the mines have eliminated human back and shoulder carrying in underground and ground transportation, thereby improving production efficiency.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang Electric: The staff and workers of iron mines in Jiangxi are carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution aimed at the weak links in ore production, so that ore production is rising steadily. The average daily output level in April increased by 16% compared with March, and the daily output level in early May increased by 10% compared with April, providing a steady supply for the needs of steel mills; the iron content of ore generally increased from 40% to over 45%.
　　Many mines in Jiangxi Province are manually mined and manually loaded and transported, which is both labor-intensive and inefficient. However, after carrying out the mass technological revolution movement, this situation has changed greatly. In terms of mining, the staff and workers of various mines have created a variety of indigenous and foreign drilling machines, such as gear-driven drilling machines, hand-pulled drilling machines, foot-operated drilling machines, and automatic rotating drill foot-operated spring impact drilling machines. The work efficiency is two to six times higher than that of manual drilling. Many specialized and county-level iron mines that did not have mineral processing equipment in the past have also created a variety of crushing and mineral processing machinery through technological innovation, which is both efficient and of good quality.
　　In terms of loading, unloading, and handling, various localities have created and innovated dozens of loading, unloading, and handling machinery. There are ore loading machines for loading ore, automatic ore unloading vehicles for unloading ore, and a wide variety of ore transportation tools. The staff and workers of Hexia Iron Mine created an automatic winch and an endless ropeway, which increased work efficiency by more than six times.

Our newspaper, Anshan, 19th: The vast number of staff and workers in the Anshan Iron and Steel Group's mine system launched a high tide of competition to increase the production of iron ore and iron concentrate in the battle of Red May, which brought about a new situation of high-speed leap forward in production. In the first half of May, the average daily output of iron ore and iron concentrate increased by 31.7% and 1.7% respectively compared with April, ensuring that blast furnaces were fed fully and well.
　　After the Anshan Iron and Steel Group's Party Committee issued a competition call to the mine staff and workers in late April, which included "Four Highs (high operating rate, high grade, high coefficient, high recovery rate) and Two Lows (low tailings, low moisture content)," the vast number of staff and workers enthusiastically launched collaborative competitions and opponent competitions between mines and mines, locomotives and locomotives, electric shovels and electric shovels, and teams and teams. The staff and workers of Gongchangling Iron Mine, which was previously known as a third-class mine, caught up in this competition and built more than 70 underground funnels, ore discharging sheds, and ore discharging platforms in just a few days, and modified and manufactured 10 pieces of equipment such as electric shovels, electric rakes, and slag loading machines. In the first half of May, the average daily output of ore from this mine increased by 38.5% compared with April, and it was finally rated as a first-class mine in the competition.
　　In order to bring the production level of iron ore and iron concentrate to a new level, various factories and mines promoted advanced technical operating experience through mutual study visits and the exchange of experiences to promote the rising tide of production.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan Electric: The staff and workers of the Daye Iron Mine of Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation vigorously increased the production of ore to ensure that the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation's blast furnaces were fed fully and well. In the first ten days of May, the output of iron concentrate, copper concentrate, and lump ore increased by 7.1%, 2.6%, and 21% respectively compared with the same period last month.
　　In late April, the Party Committee of Daye Iron Mine put forward the fighting slogan to all the mine staff and workers to fight hard in May and June and strive to complete 65% of the annual plan in the first half of the year. From the workshop to the team, the masses were mobilized at all levels, and a production upsurge of increasing ore production was quickly set off. Leading cadres at all levels generally went deep into the front line of production, implemented layer-by-layer contracting, and led the masses to attack the key to production. When attacking the key to perforation and blasting, the Party Committee led the cadres of the Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League, together with the cadres of the workshop, to guard the mountain and eat with the mountain, and sleep with the mountain, and promptly broke through the key that the perforation machine had many equipment accidents and low efficiency, so that the perforation efficiency increased from 80 meters per shift to more than 100 meters.
　　This mine also strengthened management work. The cadres of various departments organized comprehensive work groups around the key to production, went to the site to work, discovered and solved problems in a timely manner, and effectively promoted the leap forward in production.

Xinhua News Agency, Baotou Electric: Baogang's ore supply base, Baiyun Obo Iron Mine, and Baiyun Obo Station, vigorously carried out road-mine cooperation. In the first ten days of May, the daily output of ore increased by more than 30% compared with the average daily output from January to April, powerfully supporting Baogang and other metallurgical enterprises in Baotou and western Inner Mongolia, which are in the high tide of steel production. Under the unified leadership of the Party Committee of the mining area in May, Baiyun Obo Iron Mine and relevant departments such as Baiyun Obo Station established a joint transportation office and vigorously carried out the "one-stop" cooperation competition in ore transportation, which greatly accelerated the vehicle turnover time. Before April 15, it took 12 to 15 hours for a train transporting ore to travel from the station to be loaded with ore and return to the station. In the first five days of May, it was reduced to an average of less than 8 hours, and the shortest time was only 2 hours.
