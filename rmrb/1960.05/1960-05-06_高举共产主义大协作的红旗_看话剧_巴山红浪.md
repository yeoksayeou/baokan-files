    Hold High the Red Flag of Communist Collaboration
    ——Watching the Drama "Bashan Red Waves"
    Feng Zi
    In order to implement the Party's general line for socialist construction, the people of the whole country are advancing towards nature and science with high spirits and firm determination; the communist spirit of "taking on difficulties, giving way to honors, learning from the advanced, and helping the backward" has become a common practice. If any unit or department still has localism, even if it is extremely individual, it is a stumbling block to our leaping era. In order to leap forward better, we must remove this stumbling block. The drama "Bashan Red Waves," recently performed by the Beijing People's Art Theater, is a good play that sings the praises of the noble style of communist collaboration and criticizes localist ideas at the same time.
    "Bashan Red Waves" is a new work by Comrade Huang Ti. This play takes the Dabashan area of southern Shaanxi as its background and reflects the mass steelmaking movement of the Great Leap Forward in 1958. Through the portrayal of several Party leaders such as Xu Kang, the first secretary of the Lingnan County Party Committee, and Feng Hanzhang, the county head of Lingbei County, it shows how the activists who emerged from the workers and peasants, inspired and encouraged by the Party, brought their soaring enthusiasm into play. Due to the rapid development of the objective situation, the two counties separated by a mountain were merged into one county, and the two iron and steel plants were merged into a steel joint enterprise combining indigenous and foreign methods. Localists, who had once been a stumbling block on the road of the masses' progress, were thoroughly criticized and exposed. The script vividly and profoundly expresses our great era, in which the people of the whole country respond to the Party's call with one heart and mind and fight for steel. To build socialism in a more, faster, better, and more economical way, we must be of one mind and have only one stand: the proletarian stand. This is precisely the mainstream of our era. This theme is fully expressed in the play.
    The author of "Bashan Red Waves" focuses on portraying, and most successfully creates, the image of the Party's leaders. Xu Kang, the first secretary of the county party committee and a veteran Red Army soldier, is a Party leader we often come into contact with in our lives. He has rich experience in revolutionary struggle and full revolutionary enthusiasm. He not only understands the masses but also knows how to inspire them to work better for the revolution. Before the character even appears on stage, the author gives a good introduction. Through the introduction of Ding Dalu, the captain of the Lingnan Iron and Steel Plant, and others to He Zhuang, the furnace master of the Lingbei Iron and Steel Plant, and the dispute between Gu Caifeng and his wife over their elderly mother's insistence on participating in work, we have a general understanding of this old Red Army soldier of the Long March. The fact that he is surrounded by young people asking him to sing as he comes on stage vividly shows the spiritual outlook of this old youth. The success of the characterization mainly lies in the leadership of political thought. His criticism of Luo Xiang's mistakes combines the Party's policy spirit and points out the prospects for large-scale steelmaking. The specific arrangements for specific issues also embody the mass viewpoint and mass line of the old Red Army. He lives among the masses, is a confidant of the masses, and is also a leader of the masses. Although Xu Kang did not directly plunge into the struggle with Fan Qiguang, under his and County Head Feng's correct leadership, he enlightened Qin Guilan and educated He Zhuang, thereby enlightening and educating more young people, Party members, League members, and the masses of Lingnan and Lingbei, launched a criticism of localism, established the idea of viewing the whole country as a single chessboard, and held high the red flag of communist collaboration to a greater extent, making people excited to see the prospects and future of rural industrial development.
    Fan Qiguang, the director of the Lingbei Iron and Steel Plant under Comrade Huang Ti's pen, is a localist who disregards the overall situation and is indifferent to others. Fan Qiguang works very hard, but his hard work is more for himself than for his work. He reaches out to his superiors for things, takes from his subordinates, and pushes away others when they reach out to him for help. When it comes to completing tasks, the first thing he thinks about is the honor of his own factory, and when it comes to competitions, the first thing he thinks about is the face of his own unit... The author grasps the typical character of a localist, and the display and formation of this character is achieved through a series of dramatic details full of action, such as the use and perception of cadres, the attitude and approach to Lingnan's request for collaboration, the all-in-one management of Party, government, labor union, and youth league, and, more seriously, the hostile attitude towards the Party branch secretary and deputy director sent by the superiors... Through these details, people can see his style of work, and, more importantly, they can see the ideological essence hidden in Fan Qiguang's soul. The ideological logic of a localist is self-contained, and the language used to express localist ideas has nothing in common with the language of our era. Every action and even every word of Fan Qiguang may cause ridicule, and this is the reason.
    The success of "Bashan Red Waves" lies not only in the creation of two typical characters with very different thoughts and styles, Xu Kang and Fan Qiguang, but also in the author's artistic skill in summarizing life in terms of structure and plot arrangement. In addition to the main line of promoting and publicizing the spirit of communist collaboration and criticizing the struggle against localist ideas, the author also arranges a series of secondary contradictions, such as He Zhuang's male chauvinist feudal remnant ideas, the young technical personnel's yearning for large state-owned enterprises... etc., illustrating that life is complex and contradictions are multifaceted. The self-contradictions that exist in some characters may develop under certain conditions. The detailed descriptions of these characters are organically linked to the main line. Fan Qiguang's localism will fuel the development of some incorrect ideas, thereby further exposing the main contradiction and making it more conducive to the exposure of the main contradiction and the criticism of localist ideas. In the process of exposing and criticizing, the ideological problems of individual characters are also readily solved. It is just that some problems are not resolved clearly and meticulously enough, such as He Zhuang's male chauvinism, which shows that the author's writing skills are not yet fully proficient.
    There are also some problems in the description of Qin Guilan and He Zhuang, this pair of young lovers. Qin Guilan is a young Party leader standing at the forefront of ideological struggle, and the author makes Qin Guilan too entangled in her emotional entanglement with He Zhuang. He Zhuang's male chauvinist ideas bring difficulties to her work, and at the same time, a certain amount of space is used to write about her concern for He Zhuang. In addition, the struggle against Fan Qiguang does not give Qin Guilan more dramatic action. Even at the end, when she is about to expose Fan Qiguang, Qin Guilan still bravely takes the stage under the encouragement of County Head Feng. It is possible to write about Qin Guilan's growth, but the problem does not lie here. Qin Guilan's feelings are at odds with the character's identity introduced in the play, and the image of Qin Guilan appearing in the script and on the stage does not seem to have achieved the author's intention.
    Comrade Huang Ti has put in a lot of work in exploring dramatic techniques, and the hard work of the author can also be seen in "Bashan Red Waves." However, excessive use of it sometimes leaves artificial traces. For example, in the first scene, when Qin Guilan reports for duty, it feels unreasonable that Fan Qiguang repeatedly fails to notice that Qin is the branch secretary and deputy director sent by the county. In the third scene, the several misunderstandings between Qin Guilan and Gu Caifeng and his wife also feel a bit artificial. These places, where the techniques are not used appropriately, also somewhat damage the character of Qin Guilan.
    Comrade Huang Ti paid attention to the characteristics of the place when experiencing life and had some preferences for legendary character relationships. This is the origin of the reunion of Xu Kang and his son. This plot is dramatic, but the author's feelings were not conveyed to the audience during the performance. Why? The reasons still need to be explored. When you love this plot, you should consider how to deal with it when writing it, otherwise it is just for the sake of the plot, which is probably not the author's original intention.
    A good play also tends to be perfect in the process of continuous processing. The author made a lot of artistic processing for the Beijing People's Art Theater to rehearse this play, and with the concerted efforts of the directors and actors of the Beijing People's Art Theater, the performance was successful. If the author makes some more revisions, this work will surely become a repertoire with a high level of ideology and art.

    高举共产主义大协作的红旗
    ——看话剧“巴山红浪”
    凤子
    为了贯彻党的社会主义建设的总路线，全国人民意气风发、斗志昂扬地向自然进军，向科学进军；“见困难就上，见荣誉就让，见先进就学，见后进就帮”这种共产主义协作精神已蔚然成风，如果某单位某部门还有本位主义者，那怕是极其个别的，也是我们这个跃进时代的绊脚石。为了更好地跃进，我们必需搬开这块绊脚石。北京人民艺术剧院最近演出的话剧“巴山红浪”，就是歌颂共产主义大协作的崇高风格、同时批判本位主义思想的一出好戏。
    “巴山红浪”是黄悌同志的新作。这个戏以陕南大巴山区为背景，反映了大跃进的1958年群众性的大炼钢铁运动，通过岭南县县委第一书记许康和岭北县县长冯汉章等几位党的领导者形象描写，看到工农群众中涌现的积极分子在党的启发鼓舞下怎样发挥了冲天的干劲。由于客观形势的迅速发展，一山之隔的两个县并成了一个县，两个炼铁厂并成为土洋结合的钢铁联合企业。曾经是群众前进路上的绊脚石的本位主义者受到彻底的批判和揭露。剧本相当生动而又深刻地表现了我们的伟大时代，全国人民万众一心地响应着党的号召，为夺钢而战。要多快好省地建设社会主义，万众一心，只有一个立场：无产阶级立场。这正是我们时代的主流。这个主题，在戏里得到充分的表现。
    “巴山红浪”作者着力刻划，而且创造得最为成功的是党的领导者的形象。县委第一书记、老红军许康是我们在生活中经常接触到的党的领导工作者，他有着丰富的革命斗争经验，有着饱满的革命斗志，既了解群众，更懂得启发群众更好地为革命工作。在人物还未出场以前，作者就作了很好的介绍，通过岭南炼铁厂队长丁大禄等人向岭北炼铁厂炉师何壮的介绍，和顾彩凤夫妇为老母亲坚持要参加工作的争执，我们对这位长征老红军就有了一个概括的认识。他上场被青年们包围着要求唱歌，这样一个细小的动作，把这位老青年的精神面貌生动地展示了出来。人物刻划的成功主要是在政治思想的领导方面，他对罗祥的错误，结合了党的政策精神的批评，同时指出大炼钢铁的远景。就在具体问题的具体布置上，也体现了老红军的群众观点和群众路线。他生活在群众中间，是群众的知心朋友，更是群众的领路人。许康虽然没有直接地投进和范启光的斗争，可是在他和冯县长的正确领导下，启发了秦桂兰，教育了何壮，从而启发教育了更多的岭南岭北的青年们、党团员和群众们，展开了对本位主义的批判，树立了一盘棋思想，更高地举起了共产主义的大协作的红旗，使人们兴奋地看到农村工业发展的前途和远景。
    黄悌同志笔下的、岭北炼铁厂厂长范启光是一个不顾大局、对别人漠不关心的本位主义者。范启光工作得很辛苦，他的辛苦与其说是为了工作，毋宁说是为了自己，对上级伸手要，对下级是伸手拿，对别部别地别人向他伸手求援时是推。对完成任务首先想到的是本厂的荣誉，对竞赛最先想到的是本单位的面子……。作者抓住了本位主义者的典型性格，而性格的展示和形成却是通过一系列的富有动作力的戏剧性细节，例如，对干部的使用和看法，对岭南要求协作的态度和作法，党政工团一身包干，更严重的是对上级派来的党支书兼副厂长怀着敌对的情绪……。通过这些细节，不正是使人看到了他的工作作风，并且更重要的是使人看到隐藏在范启光灵魂深处的思想实质。本位主义者的思想逻辑是自成一套的，表达本位主义思想的语言和我们这个时代的语言也是没有共同之处的。范启光的每一行动，甚至每一句话都可能引起人们的讽笑，原因也在此。
    “巴山红浪”的成功，除了创造了许康、范启光这两个思想、作风回然不同的典型人物外，在结构上、情节安排上也看出作者概括生活的艺术工力。在围绕发扬和宣传共产主义大协作的风貌、批判本位主义思想斗争这个主线外，作者还安排了一连串的次要矛盾，如何壮的大男子主义的封建残余思想，青年技术人员对国营大企业的向往……等等，说明生活是复杂的、矛盾是多方面的，有些人物身上存在的自我矛盾，在一定的条件下可能发展起来，对这些人物的细节描写，和主线是有机地联系着的。范启光的本位主义会助长某些不正确思想的发展，从而也更进一步地暴露了主要矛盾，更有利于主要矛盾的揭露和对本位主义思想的批判。在揭露和批判的过程中，个别人物的思想问题也都迎刃而解了。只是有些问题解决的还不够清楚和细致，如何壮的大男子主义，看出作者的笔力还不是游刃有余的。
    对于秦桂兰和何壮这一对青年爱人的描写也还存在一些问题。秦桂兰是站在思想斗争前线的年青的党的领导者，作者过多地使秦桂兰纠缠在同何壮的感情纠葛中。何壮的大男子主义思想给她带来工作上的困难，同时又以一定篇幅来写她对何壮的关心，加上对范启光的斗争并未给秦桂兰更多的戏剧性的行动，甚至在最后要给范启光揭盖子了，秦桂兰也还是在冯县长的鼓励下才勇敢上阵的。可以写秦桂兰的成长，但是问题并不在这里。秦桂兰的感情和剧中介绍的人物身分是有距离的，剧本和舞台上出现的秦桂兰的形象似乎未能达到作者的意图。
    黄悌同志对戏剧技巧的探索是花过劳动的，“巴山红浪”中也看出作者的工力。但是运用得过多有时会遗留下人为的痕迹。如第一场秦桂兰报到，范启光一而再地未注意秦就是县里派来的支部书记兼副厂长，就感到不够合理。第三场秦桂兰和顾彩凤夫妇谈话，双方的几个误会也感到有点造作。这些地方，技巧运用的不够恰当，也多少损害了秦桂兰这个人物。
    黄悌同志在体验生活时注意到地方的特点，对于传奇性的人物关系有些偏爱。这是许康父子团圆这一情节的由来。这一情节是富有戏剧性的，但作者的感受演出时并未感染给观众。为什么呢？原因还需要探索。热爱这一情节，下笔时应考虑如何处理这一情节，否则是为情节而情节，恐怕绝不是作者的本意。
    一个好戏也是在不断的加工过程中更趋于完美的，作者为北京人民艺术剧院排演这个戏又作了不少艺术加工，在北京人艺导演演员通力合作下，演出是成功的。如果作者再作一些修改，这个作品必将成为思想上、艺术上具有较高水平的保留剧目。
