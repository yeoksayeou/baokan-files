    This paper reports that Wanrong County, Shanxi Province, in the upsurge of popularizing amateur primary education and vigorously running amateur secondary schools, continues to leverage the power of pinyin to expand the results of literacy at high speed through a mass-based reading and writing movement, rapidly developing farmers' amateur education from single-subject advancement to multi-subject teaching.
    After Wanrong County completed the task of literacy among young and middle-aged people at high speed last year using pinyin, it immediately launched an upsurge of vigorously running amateur primary schools and amateur secondary schools. By January of this year, the number of people participating in amateur primary school studies in the county reached more than 50,000, and 8,000 people were studying in amateur secondary schools. The number of students enrolled accounted for more than 87% of the total number of young and middle-aged people in the county.
    In order to consolidate and expand the results of literacy and create conditions for the comprehensive teaching of basic knowledge courses, the Wanrong County Party Committee, after repeated research, instructed all localities to continue to use pinyin to expand literacy while also conducting multi-subject teaching, including politics, arithmetic, technology, and language, in amateur primary schools and amateur secondary schools at the appropriate time. According to this instruction from the County Party Committee, all farmer amateur primary schools in the county launched a "Read and Write Extensively" movement again in January of this year. In these four months, Xinhua Bookstore supplied 400,000 copies of annotated reading materials to rural areas, which is equal to the total supply for the whole of last year. The vast rural libraries have also established mobile book stations to deliver books to the fields. The teachers of various amateur primary schools have become tutors for the masses in reading and writing, and the trend of reading has rapidly spread throughout the county. According to statistics from Sunji Commune from January to April, more than 3,900 people participated in reading activities, reading more than 67,200 books.
    In order to consolidate literacy achievements and enable farmers to quickly master Chinese characters, amateur primary schools throughout the county also launched an extensive writing movement while reading extensively. Commune members write about whatever they see. This not only practices writing but also consolidates the characters already known. In April alone, students from amateur primary schools and amateur secondary schools throughout the county wrote more than 661,000 poems or rhymes, more than 361,000 articles, and more than 31,000 diary entries.
    While the mass reading and writing movement was being carried out in farmer amateur primary schools and amateur secondary schools throughout the county, the county, communes, and management areas further improved the leading bodies for farmer amateur education. More than 100 full-time cadres were assigned throughout the county, more than 1,500 amateur school teachers were trained, and the work of compiling teaching materials was started from the bottom up. By March, many management areas, such as Sunji, Jiacun, and Qinggu, had compiled arithmetic, technology, and political teaching materials.
    Because students have mastered more Chinese characters, the teaching progress of other courses has also been greatly accelerated. For example, the arithmetic course in the amateur primary school of Sunji Management Area of Sunji Commune was originally scheduled to take 240 hours of instruction, but now it can be completed in 80 hours. In this way, all 50,000 farmers attending amateur senior primary schools in the county can be transferred to amateur secondary schools before the end of this year.

    万荣更上一层楼
    继续发挥拼音字母威力大办业余学校
    本报讯　山西省万荣县在普及业余小学教育和大办业余中学高潮中，继续发挥拼音字母的威力，通过全民性的大读大写运动，高速度地扩大了扫盲成果，使农民的业余教育迅速地由单科独进发展到多科教学。
    万荣县在去年运用拼音字母高速度完成了青壮年中的扫盲任务后，立即掀起了大办业余小学和业余中学的高潮，到今年1月，全县参加业余小学学习的人数达到五万人以上，有八千人在业余中学学习。入学人数占全县青壮年总数的87％以上。
    为了巩固和扩大扫盲成果，为全面进行基础知识课的教学创造条件，中共万荣县委经过反复研究后，指示各地在继续运用拼音字母扩大识字的同时，适时地在业余小学和业余中学中进行包括政治、算术、技术、语文在内的多科教学。根据县委这一指示，全县所有的农民业余小学从今年1月份又开展了“大读大写”运动。在这4个月中，新华书店向农村供应了四十万册注音读物，等于去年全年的供应量。广大农村图书室，也建立了流动图书站，把书籍送到田间。各业余小学的教师，成为群众读书写话的辅导员，读书之风迅速遍及全县。据孙吉公社从1月到4月份的统计，就有三千九百多人参加了读书活动，读书六万七千二百多本。
    为了巩固认字成绩，并使农民迅速掌握汉字，在大读书的同时，全县业余小学还开展了大写话运动。社员们见什么写什么。这样既练了笔，也巩固了已经认识的字。仅4月份，全县业余小学和业余中学的学生，就写出六十六万一千多首诗或顺口溜，三十六万一千多篇文章，三万一千多篇日记。
    在全县农民业余小学和业余中学开展大读大写运动的同时，县、公社、管理区，进一步健全了农民业余教育的领导机构，全县配备了一百多个专职干部，集训了一千五百多名业余学校的教师，并由下而上地开始了编写教材的工作。到3月份，全县已经有孙吉、贾村、青谷等许多管理区编出了算术、技术和政治教材。
    由于学员们掌握了更多的汉字，其它课程的教学进度也大大地加快了。如孙吉公社孙吉管理区的业余小学的算术课程，原订授课时间为二百四十个小时，现在，有八十个小时就可以学完。这样，全县五万个上业余高小的农民，今年年前就可以全部转入业余中学。
