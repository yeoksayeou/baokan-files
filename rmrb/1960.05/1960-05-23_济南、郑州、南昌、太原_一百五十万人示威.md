Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, May 22nd: A grand demonstration of 520,000 people was held in Jinan City on the 21st. The mighty crowd carried banners and posters, and waved flags, chanting slogans such as "Support the Soviet government's just stance on the U.S. imperialist aggression!" and "Oppose U.S. imperialism's sabotage of the Four-Power Summit!"

On the rostrum of the central venue were the party and government leaders of Shandong Province and Jinan City, leading officers of the local garrison, heads of various people's organizations, responsible persons of local organizations of various democratic parties, first secretaries and secretaries of the municipal and prefectural committees attending meetings in Jinan, and representatives of advanced producers on the industrial, agricultural, transportation, cultural, and educational fronts. Soviet experts who are assisting our country in construction in Jinan and Vietnamese students from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam studying in Jinan also attended today's meeting.

At 3 p.m., the meeting began amidst warm applause and slogans. Shu Tong, First Secretary of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke first. He solemnly declared on behalf of the 54 million people of Shandong that the people of Shandong, like the people of the whole country, resolutely support the just stance of the Soviet government and resolutely oppose U.S. imperialism's sabotage of the Four-Power Summit. After profoundly exposing the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism, Shu Tong emphasized: Only by strengthening the rock-solid unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, only by forming a broad united front with peace-loving people all over the world, and only by engaging in a resolute struggle with U.S. imperialism, can we stop the U.S. imperialist conspiracy to launch a new war. Shu Tong's speech was constantly interrupted by applause and slogans from the crowd.

Soviet expert S.A. Bauderles spoke at the meeting, pointing out that the people of the socialist camp love peace, but we are also prepared to give the American aggressors and their accomplices a fatal blow at any moment.

Zhang Weicen, head of local organizations of various democratic parties, Li Chengzhi, vice chairman of the Shandong Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, and Cheng Fangwu, president of the Shandong Branch of the China-Soviet Friendship Association, also spoke at the meeting. They expressed their firm support for the Soviet government's just stance and resolutely opposed U.S. imperialism's sabotage of the Four-Power Summit.

Also speaking at today's meeting were heads of various people's organizations, as well as representatives of workers, militiamen, members of people's communes, representatives attending the provincial cultural and educational heroes meeting, and student representatives.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, May 22nd: 350,000 people from all walks of life in Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan Province, held a massive demonstration and rally this morning to support the just stance of the Soviet Union and oppose U.S. imperialism's sabotage of the Four-Power Summit.

The meeting was held simultaneously in six locations; more than 50,000 farmers and large numbers of militiamen in the suburbs gathered in front of radios to listen to the live broadcast of the meeting. Experts from the German Democratic Republic in Zhengzhou and Vietnamese students in Henan also participated in the meeting.

In the early morning, railway workers, textile workers, students, cadres, citizens, garrison troops, and fully armed militiamen carried huge banners and cartoons, and marched in orderly ranks into various venues. The textile workers also held a masquerade parade: Eisenhower and a small group of reactionaries, clutching the wreckage of a downed plane, looked extremely embarrassed in front of the angry crowd.

Slogans such as "Oppose U.S. imperialist aggression and provocations against the Soviet Union!" and "People of the world unite, down with U.S. imperialism!" rose and fell like a storm.

Shi Xiangsheng, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke at the meeting. He said that the 50 million people of Henan Province resolutely support the solemn stance expressed by Premier Zhou Enlai and Comrade Deng Xiaoping on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the Chinese government. We strongly condemn the crimes of U.S. imperialism in invading the Soviet Union and sabotaging the Four-Power Summit with great anger, and fully support the solemn stance taken by the Soviet Union on the Four-Power Summit.

Du Mengmo, Chairman of the Henan Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, Ji Wenfu, Chairman of the Henan Provincial Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, Zhao Fengqi, Secretary of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, worker representative Liu Qunzhang, farmer representative Sun Shixun, and others spoke at the meeting. They unanimously supported the Soviet government's just stance and severely condemned U.S. imperialism's crimes of sabotaging the Four-Power Summit.

After the meeting, the masses held a demonstration parade in the streets and alleys of the city.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, May 22nd: 330,000 people in Nanchang City, Jiangxi Province, held a grand rally and demonstration yesterday to support the Soviet Union's just stance against U.S. imperialist aggression and oppose the U.S.'s sabotage of the Four-Power Summit.

The meeting was held in separate districts, with the central venue set up in "August 1st" Square.

Yang Shangkui, First Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke at the meeting. He said that in the current world situation, the East wind is prevailing over the West wind. The storm of revolution is getting stronger and stronger, and the lifespan of imperialism is not long. As long as the people of all countries are awakened and persist in the struggle, they will speed up the end of imperialism's life and achieve true and lasting peace. He said that all the people of Jiangxi Province, like the people of the whole country, firmly stand with the Soviet people, with the people of all countries in the socialist camp, and with the peace-loving people all over the world, and warn the U.S. government: it is impossible to treat us with an imperialist attitude. An infringement on the Soviet Union is an infringement on China, and an infringement on the entire socialist camp. This infringement will inevitably be met with a devastating counterattack.

Afterwards, Soviet expert representative Vralov spoke. Representatives of local organizations of various democratic parties, various people's organizations, as well as representatives of workers, farmers, and youth also spoke at the meeting. After the meeting, hundreds of thousands of people shouted earth-shattering slogans and held a large demonstration.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, May 22nd: 300,000 people from all walks of life in Taiyuan City held an unprecedented grand rally and parade on the afternoon of the 21st to support the Soviet government's just stance against U.S. imperialist aggression and angrily condemn U.S. imperialism's sabotage of the Four-Power Summit.

The central venue of the meeting was located in "May 1st" Square, where 150,000 people gathered. At the same time, rallies were also held in Xishan, Jiancaoping, Yijing and other places, with a total of 150,000 people participating. The people participating in the meeting held up huge cartoons and banners, waved their fists, and shouted earth-shattering roars: "Oppose U.S. imperialist aggression and provocations against the Soviet Union!"
"People of the world unite, down with U.S. imperialism!"

Party and government leaders of Shanxi Province and Taiyuan City, leading officers of the Shanxi garrison, heads of various democratic parties and people's organizations, and experts from the Soviet Union and other socialist countries who are helping to build Taiyuan all participated in the meeting.

Tao Lujia, First Secretary of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke at the meeting, and he solemnly declared on behalf of the 16 million people of Shanxi Province: We resolutely support the just stance of the Soviet government. He pointed out that the responsibility for sabotaging the Four-Power Summit lies entirely with the imperialist group headed by the United States, with the U.S. government headed by Eisenhower, and with Eisenhower himself. Now the imperialist group headed by the United States is everywhere in the world antagonizing the people, which by no means indicates the strength of imperialism, on the contrary, it only shows the original form of their increasingly declining paper tiger. One day, U.S. imperialism will roll back to its old home from Asia, Africa, and Latin America under the increasingly strong power of the struggle of the people all over the world. The arrival of this day will not be far away.

Afterwards, Shi Jiyan, Vice Chairman of the Shanxi Provincial Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, Wang Guixin, Chairman of the Shanxi Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, Guo Yu'en, National Agricultural Labor Model, representatives of local organizations of democratic parties, and student representatives also spoke at the meeting. After the meeting, a large demonstration and parade was held. Red flags were waving everywhere in the streets, alleys, factories, and mines throughout the city, and the roar of voices echoed in the sky. A storm against U.S. imperialism swept every corner of Taiyuan City.

    清晨，铁路工人、纺织工人、学生、干部、市民、驻军和全副武装的民兵抬着巨幅标语、漫画，排着整齐的行列分别涌进各个会场。纺织工人们还举行了化装游行：艾森豪威尔和一小撮反动派，夹着被击落的飞机的残骸，在愤怒的人群前面，显得狼狈异常。
