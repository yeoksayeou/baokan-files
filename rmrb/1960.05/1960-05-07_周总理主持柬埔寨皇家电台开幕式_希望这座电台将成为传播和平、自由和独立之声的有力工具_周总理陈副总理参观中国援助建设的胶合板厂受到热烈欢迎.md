Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, 6th. Premier Zhou Enlai presided over the opening ceremony of the Cambodian Royal Radio Station this morning at 10:00 AM (local time) in the company of Prince Sihanouk. This radio station was a gift from Premier Zhou Enlai to Prince Sihanouk during his last visit to Cambodia.

When Premier Zhou Enlai, Prince Sihanouk, Vice Premier Chen Yi, and Premier Zhou's other entourage members arrived at Song Renji, they were warmly welcomed by officials of the Royal Government and crowds gathered around. The radio station was beautifully decorated with the national flags of China and Cambodia today.

In his welcoming speech, Cambodian Minister of Information, Xiao Sang, expressed his gratitude to Premier Zhou Enlai on behalf of the Royal Government and tens of thousands of listeners. He emphasized that this gift "is an excellent proof of the sincere friendly relations between China and Cambodia. In fact, the friendly China unconditionally provided us with this powerful radio station, which means that it has provided us with the possibility of making people hear our neutral voice" and "the possibility of rejecting voices of hatred."

In his reply, Premier Zhou Enlai said: "Cambodia is a country that loves peace, freedom, and independence, and its voice should be heard by the world. I sincerely hope that this radio station will become a powerful tool for spreading the voices of peace, freedom, and independence."

Subsequently, Premier Zhou Enlai was invited to cut the ribbon. After the ribbon-cutting, Premier Zhou Enlai, accompanied by Prince Sihanouk, visited various parts of the radio station.

Prince Sihanouk laid the first foundation stone for this radio station in November 1958. With the excellent cooperation of Chinese experts and Cambodian technicians, the first phase of the radio station's construction project was completed in December last year. Today, the radio station was officially handed over for use.

Prince Sihanouk once said that through this radio station, Cambodia's voice of peace and friendship will cross plains, mountains, and oceans and be heard by other countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, 6th. Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi, accompanied by Prince Sihanouk, Cambodian Prime Minister Pho Proeung, First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Production Nhiek Tioulong, and Second Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Tep Phan, visited the Chinese-aided plywood factory in Jian Sui this morning.

When Premier Zhou arrived at the factory, he was warmly welcomed by the Cambodian workers and Chinese experts of the factory, as well as the crowds standing on both sides of the street outside the factory. They enthusiastically shouted: "Long live Premier Zhou Enlai!" "Long live Prince Sihanouk!" "Long live Sino-Cambodian friendship!"

The workers of this factory had long prepared to welcome the Chinese Premier. They paved the roads for the Chinese guests, decorated the buildings, and erected arches decorated with green leaves. Among the many banners hanging on the factory grounds, one banner read: "The people of China and Cambodia are as close as brothers."

Premier Zhou Enlai visited the factory, which is under construction. The construction of this factory began in April last year, and it is now installing equipment. After being completed and put into production, it will be able to produce 900,000 square meters of plywood annually.

During his visit, Premier Zhou Enlai talked with many Cambodian workers and inquired about their work, technical studies, and cooperation with Chinese technicians.

Cambodian First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Production Nhiek Tioulong told the Chinese Premier that this factory is like a school. He said that Chinese technicians worked tirelessly to help Cambodian workers master technology, and they worked together and cooperated very well.

At the end of the visit, Premier Zhou Enlai, Prince Sihanouk, and Vice Premier Chen Yi wrote inscriptions in the guestbook. Premier Zhou Enlai wrote: "The people of China and Cambodia support each other, learn from each other, and work hard to build their respective motherlands!" Prince Sihanouk wrote: "I am very happy to visit this plywood factory with Premier Zhou Enlai of the People's China. The friendly visit of Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi to Cambodia is a great honor for the Khmer nation. Thanks to the sincere assistance of the People's China, Cambodia's economy has begun to move along the path of progress and independence. We are very grateful to Your Excellency and the country you represent. Long live the great People's Republic of China! Long live Premier Zhou Enlai! Long live the friendly cooperation between Cambodia and China!" Vice Premier Chen Yi wrote: "May the friendship between China and Cambodia last forever!"

When Premier Zhou Enlai and Prince Sihanouk left the factory, the Cambodian workers and Chinese experts gathered at the gate, warmly cheering and applauding to bid farewell to the Chinese guests.

Along the 26-kilometer road from Phnom Penh to the factory, every town and village road was lined with crowds cheering him as Premier Zhou Enlai passed by.

    周恩来总理参观了这座正在建设中的工厂。这个工厂的修建工程是在去年4月开始的，现在已经在安装设备，在建成投入生产以后，每年能生产九十万平方米的胶合板。
    周恩来总理在各处参观的时候，同许多柬埔寨工人进行了交谈，并且询问了关于他们的工作、学习技术和同中国技术人员合作的情况。
    柬埔寨第一副首相兼生产大臣涅刁隆对中国总理说，这个工厂像一所学校。他说，中国技术人员不辞劳苦地帮助柬埔寨工人掌握技术，他们在一起工作，合作得非常好。
    在访问结束时，周恩来总理、西哈努克亲王和陈毅副总理在留言簿上题了辞。周恩来总理写道：“中柬两国人民互相支持，互相学习，为建设各自的祖国而努力工作！”西哈努克亲王写道：“我非常高兴同人民中国总理周恩来阁下一起来参观这个胶合板工厂。周恩来总理和陈毅副总理对柬埔寨进行的友好访问，使高棉民族感到非常荣幸。由于人民中国的真诚援助，柬埔寨的经济已经开始沿着进步和独立的道路前进。我们非常感谢阁下和您所代表的国家。伟大的中华人民共和国万岁！周恩来总理阁下万岁！柬埔寨和中国之间的友好合作万岁！”陈毅副总理写道：“愿中柬两国的友谊万古长青！”
    当周恩来总理和西哈努克亲王离开工厂时，那里的柬埔寨工人和中国专家们聚集在大门口，热烈地欢呼和鼓掌，来欢送中国贵宾们。
    在周恩来总理来往途中经过从金边到这个工厂的长达二十六公里的路上，每一个市镇和乡村道路两旁的群众都向他欢呼。
