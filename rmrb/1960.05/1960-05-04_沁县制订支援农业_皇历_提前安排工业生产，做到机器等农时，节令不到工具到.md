Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan Electric Dispatch: The local industry and commune industry departments in Qin County, Shanxi Province, closely center their work around the agricultural activities of each period, comprehensively arranging industrial production to ensure industrial support for agriculture precedes the farming season. Locals call this approach the industrial support for agriculture "almanac."

This industrial support for agriculture "almanac" was formulated by the Qin County Party Committee to better implement the policy of "facing the countryside and serving agricultural production" within the local industry and commune industry departments. In the past, industrial departments lacked a comprehensive and unified annual plan and arrangement, leading to late starts on the manufacturing of many machines. Often, they focused on manufacturing but neglected repairs, concentrated on large items but ignored small ones, failing to meet the seasonal needs of agricultural production. This year, the county party committee conducted a detailed survey of agriculture's demands on industry and the actual production capacity of each factory. They convened meetings with industrial, agricultural, commercial, machinery, and farm tool manufacturing units, as well as commune cadres, experienced farmers, and technicians for thorough research. Then, based on the characteristics of each farming season, they formulated the industrial support for agriculture "almanac."

The specific content of this "almanac" is: each industrial department, adhering to the spirit of "early support is valuable," closely centers its work around the production activities of each farming season, determining the focus of industrial support for agriculture. It makes specific arrangements regarding what agriculture needs, how much is needed, product specifications and quality, which unit is responsible for manufacturing, and completion times. Furthermore, based on the seasonal nature of agricultural production and the continuous nature of industrial production, the production of tools used year-round is organized through a combination of concentrated efforts and continuous production. For seasonal tools, production is organized one season, one month, or one solar term ahead of the agricultural production season. For example, the central focus of agricultural production activities in February is: before the Beginning of Spring and Rain Water solar terms in February, accumulate fertilizer and deliver it, tidy up fields and gardens, dig wells and canals, repair water conservancy, and comprehensively prepare for plowing without rest. The industrial department focuses on this a month in advance, determining the focus of industrial support for agriculture in January to be: produce transportation tools in large quantities, repair all kinds of vehicles, repair and replenish small farm tools, and fully prepare shovels, hoes, and baskets. In this way, the tools needed for agricultural production in February can be manufactured in January, achieving "tools prepared early, machines waiting for the farming season, and tools arriving before the solar terms."

Another characteristic of the industrial support for agriculture "almanac" is that it is formulated according to the spirit of combining large and small, emphasizing both manufacturing and repairing, integrating creation and improvement, combining key points and general aspects, and comprehensively supporting agricultural production and agricultural technology transformation. It comprehensively arranges the repair and replenishment of various small farm tools and the repair of machinery and production of mechanical parts, leaving nothing out. For example, the central task of industrial support for agriculture in May is to manufacture wheat harvesters, wheat threshers, and modify windmills, but it also arranges for the production of sickles and small threshing tools. This approach grasps the central task while also taking care of general needs, avoiding the phenomenon of focusing on one thing while neglecting others, focusing on large items while neglecting small ones, and emphasizing manufacturing over repair.

The industrial support for agriculture "almanac" makes specific provisions for the division of labor and collaboration among various farm tool and machinery manufacturing units. General small farm tools and machines with relatively simple technology are produced by the farm tool factories of each commune. Large and technologically complex machines are produced by the county machinery factory. This division of labor both regulates and balances the production of each factory and facilitates each commune to reform and create various new tools according to local conditions. County-run factories can concentrate their efforts on trial-producing and producing more precise machines, enabling industrial departments to better support agriculture.

With the conscientious implementation of the industrial support for agriculture "almanac," this year, the work of Qin County's industrial support for agriculture has preceded the farming season, fully meeting the needs of agricultural production. In February, according to the "almanac," in addition to manufacturing irrigation and drainage machinery and small farm tools, each factory also organized nineteen mobile repair teams to repair forty-nine irrigation and drainage machines, install twenty-three power pumps and waterwheels, and help each commune establish seventeen elevated irrigation stations, ensuring the smooth spring irrigation of wheat and overcoming the spring drought. After the development of water conservancy in the county expanded the rice planting area, the "almanac" stipulated that the county agricultural machinery factory, woodware factory, and the farm tool factories of Xin Dian and Chengguan communes, among others, would manufacture two hundred rice transplanters in May (Qin County has a cold climate, and rice transplanting takes place in June); as early as February, these factories sent technicians to Guangdong, Guangxi, Zhejiang, and other places to visit and study. After returning to the factory, they successfully trial-produced rice transplanters in mid-March and have now begun mass production. (Attached chart)

### 沁县制订支援农业“皇历”  提前安排工业生产，做到机器等农时，节令不到工具到

    沁县制订支援农业“皇历”
    提前安排工业生产，做到机器等农时，节令不到工具到
    据新华社太原电　山西省沁县地方工业和公社工业部门，紧紧围绕各个时期农事活动的中心，全面安排工业生产，使工业对农业的支援赶在农事季节的前面。当地人民把这种做法称为工业支援农业的“皇历”。
    这种工业支援农业的“皇历”，是中共沁县县委为了在地方工业和公社工业部门中，更好地贯彻“面向农村，为农业生产服务”的方针而制定的。过去，工业部门由于缺乏常年的全面统一的计划和安排，对不少机具的制造动手得晚，往往顾了制造，误了修配，抓了大的，丢了小的，不能适应农业生产季节性的需要。今年以来，县委详细调查了农业对工业的要求和各工厂的实际生产能力，分别召开了工业、农业、商业、机械、农具制造单位、公社干部、老农、技术人员等会议，进行细致的研究，然后，根据各个农事季节的特点，制订出了工业支援农业的“皇历”。
    这种“皇历”的具体内容是：各工业部门本着支援农业贵在早的精神，紧紧围绕着各个农事季节生产活动的中心，确定了工业支援农业的中心，对农业需要些什么，需要多少，产品规格质量，哪个单位负责制造、完成时间等都做了具体安排。并且根据农业生产季节性和工业生产连续性的特点，对常年使用和常年生产的机具，采取分段突击和常年生产相结合的办法组织生产；对季节性强的机具，都按照农业生产需用的季节分别提前一季、一月或一个节令组织生产。如2月农业生产活动的中心是：2月立春雨水前，积肥送肥整田园，打井开渠修水利，全面备耕不消闲。工业部门就提前一个月紧紧围绕这个中心，确定1月份工业支援农业的中心是：运输工具大量造，各种车辆要修好，整修添补小农具，锹镢箩头要备全。这样，就使农业生产上2月份需要的机具，在1月即可造好，做到“工具早准备，机器等农时，节令不到工具到”。
  工业支援农业“皇历”的另一个特点，是根据大与小结合，造与修并重，创与改同抓，重点和一般结合，全面支援农业生产和农业技术改造的精神制订的，对各种小农具的整修添补和机械的修理、机械配件的生产，做到了样样不漏，全面安排。如5月份工业支援农业的中心任务是制造割麦机、脱麦机和改制风车，但同时也安排镰刀和打场小农具的生产。这样既抓住了中心，又兼顾一般，避免了顾此失彼、顾大失小、重制造轻修理的现象。
    工业支援农业“皇历”，对各农具和机械制造单位的分工和协作作了具体规定。一般小农具和技术较简单的机具，由各公社农具厂生产；大型的、技术比较复杂的机具，由县机械厂生产。这样分工，既调剂和平衡了各厂的生产，又便于各公社因地制宜地改革和创造各种新工具，县营工厂可以集中力量试制和生产比较精密的机具，使工业部门更好地支援农业。
    随着工业支援农业“皇历”的认真推行，今年以来，沁县工业支援农业的工作赶在了农事季节的前面，充分满足了农业生产的需要。2月份各工厂根据“皇历”，除制造排灌机械和小农具以外，还组织了十九个流动检修队，检修排灌机械四十九部，安装动力抽水机和水车二十三部，帮助各公社建立高灌站十七处，保证了小麦春浇顺利进行，战胜了春旱。全县水利事业发展后，水稻播种面积扩大，“皇历”便规定县农业机械厂、木器厂和新店、城关公社农具厂等工厂要在5月份制造出水稻插秧机二百部，（沁县气候较冷，水稻插秧在6月份）；这些工厂早在2月份就派出技术工人到广东、广西、浙江等地参观学习，回厂后在3月中旬将水稻插秧机试制成功，现在已开始成批生产。（附图表）
