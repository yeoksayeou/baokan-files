A patriotic Nguyen Ai Quoc at the beginning of the century, now building a new Vietnam.
The Red River flows on forever, may you live another seventy years.
The other day I asked about your old residence in Nghi An, today a birthday banquet is set in Hanoi.
Of the old generation internationally, few remain, you are the leading figure in Southeast Asia.
Underground work was often arduous, guerrilla warfare overcame countless difficulties.
Serving the people with a heart of iron, the masses love and respect you like a sage.
China and Vietnam are as interdependent as lips and teeth, the rear and the front support each other.
A pillar in the south stands tall and strong, a hero's courage and longevity are complete.

May 13, 1960, in Hanoi

    胡志明主席七十大寿祝辞
    陈毅世纪之初阮爱国，而今建设新越南。红河流水永不绝，祝公再寿七十年。前日宜安问故居，今日河内摆寿筵。国际老辈今余几，风流人物首亚南。地下工作多艰苦，游击战争排万难。服务人民心如铁，群众爱戴似圣贤。中越相依如唇齿，后方前线互支援。一柱南天欣顽健，英雄肝胆福寿全。
   一九六○年五月十三日于河内
