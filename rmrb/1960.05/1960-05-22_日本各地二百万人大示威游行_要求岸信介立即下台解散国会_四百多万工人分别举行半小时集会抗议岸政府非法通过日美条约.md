Xinhua News Agency, May 21st -- According to a broadcast by Japan Shortwave Broadcasting Corporation at 11:30 on the 20th, two million people across Japan participated in demonstrations and marches to protest the Nobusuke Kishi group's violent and illegal "passage" of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, demanding the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and the dissolution of the Diet.

According to Tokyo sources, 4.6 million workers affiliated with the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) and the Federation of Independent Unions held 30-minute demonstrations and workplace protest rallies during working hours. Almost all workshop gatherings passed resolutions condemning the Liberal Democratic Party's policies and declaring that they would not accept the treaty "passed" by the Diet.

Two thousand "Joint Struggle Conferences to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty" across Japan launched countless rallies and signature campaigns.

In Gunma Prefecture, one thousand stores went on strike to protest the "passage" of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

Xinhua News Agency, May 21st -- Tokyo dispatch: About 30,000 angry people surrounded Nobusuke Kishi's private residence tonight, chanting enthusiastically: "The Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet should resign immediately!"

Representatives from various places, numbering 25,000, and 5,000 Tokyo workers held a rally in Shimizu Valley Park earlier today before marching towards Kishi Nobusuke's residence.

As the demonstrators advanced, they appealed to passers-by not to forgive the Kishi Nobusuke group for insulting the people.

When the demonstrators reached a point 50 meters away from Kishi Nobusuke's residence, the police arrived in trucks to prevent them from getting closer to the gate of Kishi Nobusuke's residence. However, at the same time, all the streets and alleys near Kishi Nobusuke's residence were quickly filled with angry people who flocked in. Within minutes, Kishi Nobusuke's residence was completely surrounded by a large number of demonstrators.

The demonstrators argued with 200 policemen who prevented them from passing through the gate of Kishi Nobusuke's residence. Finally, they succeeded in removing the police obstacles.

They held an emotionally charged demonstration in front of Kishi Nobusuke's residence for two consecutive hours, constantly chanting: "Resign immediately!", "Traitor!", "We do not agree with the new Security Treaty!".

Then, they held a demonstration march on the bustling weekend streets.

Xinhua News Agency, May 21st -- Tokyo dispatch: Two thousand Japanese workers, students, and ordinary citizens held a massive wave-like demonstration in front of the U.S. Embassy in Japan this afternoon. They chanted: "Oppose the Japan-U.S. military alliance!", "Oppose Eisenhower's visit to Japan!", "U.S. U-2 jet aircraft must immediately withdraw from Japan!", "Yankees go home!"

The demonstration was led by people gathered around the Diet and demonstrators from Kanagawa Prefecture who opposed U.S. spy planes. They broke through the police cordon that prevented them from approaching the U.S. Embassy. The gates of the U.S. Embassy were tightly closed, guarded by about two hundred policemen.

Demonstrators from Niigata and Mie prefectures also participated in the demonstration.

After a thirty-minute intense protest in front of the U.S. Embassy, the demonstrators began to march towards Shimizu Valley Park at 5:00 pm, where they joined more than 10,000 workers in a rally.

Earlier, when the Kanagawa Prefecture demonstration team, demanding the withdrawal of U.S. spy planes, arrived in Tokyo, citizens on both sides of the road cheered and applauded them.

These demonstrators held a rally in Shiba Park on their way to the Diet and passed a resolution. The resolution stated that they would resolutely struggle to crush the Kishi Nobusuke government's militarist policies. The resolution emphasized that, due to this policy, aggressive military bases had appeared on Japanese territory and become a dangerous source in Asia. (Attached photo)

    新华社21日讯　据日本短波广播公司20日十一时三十分广播，日本全国各地有两百万人参加示威游行，抗议岸信介集团用暴力强行非法“通过”日美军事同盟条约，要求岸信介内阁下台，解散国会。
    另据东京消息，日本工会总评议会和独立工会联合会所属的四百六十万工人，在上工时间内举行了三十分钟的示威和工作场所抗议集会。几乎所有的车间集会都通过了决议，谴责自由民主党的政策，并宣布不接受国会“通过”的条约。
    日本各地两千个“阻止修改安全条约共同斗争会议”发起了无数次集会和征集签名运动。
    在群马县，有一千家商店罢市，抗议“通过”新日美“安全条约”。
    新华社21日讯　东京消息：大约三万名愤怒的群众今天晚上包围了岸信介的私人住宅，斗志昂扬地高呼：“岸信介内阁立即总辞职！”
    来自各个地方的代表二万五千人和五千名东京工人在清水谷公园举行大会后，今天早一些时候开始向岸信介的住宅进发。
    示威者们一面前进，一面呼吁过路的人们决不要饶恕岸信介集团对人民的侮辱。
    当示威者到达离岸信介住宅五十米的地方的时候，警察开了卡车前来阻挠他们进一步接近岸信介住宅的大门。但是，与此同时，岸信介住宅附近所有的大街小巷都很快地被蜂拥而来的愤怒的群众挤满了。在几分钟之内，岸信介的住宅就被人数众多的示威者完全包围了起来。
    示威者同阻止他们通过岸信介住宅大门的二百名警察争吵起来。最后，他们终于成功地移开了警察的障碍物。
    他们在岸信介住宅前面连续两个小时举行了情绪激昂的示威，不断高呼：“马上辞职！”，“卖国贼！”，“我们不同意新安全条约！”。
    接着，他们又在周末的熙熙攘攘的街道上举行了游行示威。
    新华社21日讯　东京消息：两万名日本工人、学生和普通市民今天下午在美国驻日大使馆门前举行了声势浩大的波浪形示威游行。他们高呼：“反对日美军事同盟！”“反对艾森豪威尔访问日本！”“美国U—2型喷气机立即撤出日本！”“美国佬快滚蛋！”
    这次示威是由集合在国会周围的人们和从神奈川县到达东京的反对美国间谍飞机的示威者带头举行的。他们列队突破了阻止他们走近美国大使馆的警察封锁线。美国大使馆的大门紧闭着，大约有二百名警察守卫在那里。
    来自新潟和三重县的示威者也参加了这次示威。
    在美国大使馆前面进行了三十分钟的激烈抗议后，示威者在下午五时开始向清水谷公园进发，在那里同一万多工人会合举行了大会。
    早些时候，要求撤出美国间谍飞机的神奈川县示威队伍到达东京时，道路两旁的市民向他们欢呼和鼓掌。
    这些示威者在前往国会的途中，曾在芝公园举行了大会，并且通过了决议。决议说，他们将坚决斗争，来粉碎岸信介政府的军国主义政策。决议强调说，由于这一政策，日本领土上出现了侵略性的军事基地，并成为亚洲危险的根源。（附图片）
