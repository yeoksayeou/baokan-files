"Without revolutionary theory, there can be no revolutionary movement." "Once theory is grasped by the masses, it immediately becomes a material force." How intimate are these famous words of Marxism-Leninism to those who are currently struggling for world peace, national independence, democratic freedom, and the cause of socialism!

Recently, news of struggles has been constantly coming from all corners of the world. More and more people are seeing, or seeing more clearly, the true face of imperialism and reactionaries in various countries. The struggle against US imperialism and its running dogs is truly surging. Chairman Mao said, "Imperialism is most afraid of the awakening of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and afraid of the awakening of the people of all countries in the world." Now is the era of the increasing awakening of the people of the world. Marxism-Leninism believes that US imperialism and its running dogs will never change their nature. They are the most ferocious enemies of the cause of world peace and the most ferocious enemies of the people of all countries. Only by waging a resolute struggle against them can world peace be maintained. This truth of Marxism-Leninism is being grasped by more and more people and is rapidly becoming a powerful force impacting the positions of US imperialism and its running dogs.

The reason why the truth of Marxism-Leninism can attract an increasingly wider range of people and inspire their awakening and struggle is, on the one hand, due to the widespread dissemination by advanced people, and on the other hand, due to the negative education of the people by US imperialism and its running dogs. Positive education, in the beginning, is "doubtful" for many people. With positive education and negative education, people can compare and thus more easily accept the truth. Precisely for this reason, Comrade Mao Zedong has always emphasized that negative teachers play a special role in many situations that no one else can play.

In the history of revolutionary struggles of the people of various countries, there are countless examples of the special role of negative teachers. There are many vivid facts before our eyes, for example: it is precisely the traitorous, fascist, and reactionary rule of the like of Syngman Rhee, Menderes, and Nobusuke Kishi that has aroused the heroic struggles of the people of South Korea, Turkey, and Japan. Syngman Rhee and Menderes have fallen, and Nobusuke Kishi is also teetering. They are all negative teachers of the people.

The number one negative teacher in the world is US imperialism. Because it is carrying out aggression all over the world, infringing upon and trampling on the territorial sovereignty of many countries, and exploiting and plundering the people of many countries, it is truly running amok and doing all kinds of evil. This cannot but arouse the awakening of the people of various countries, forcing them to strengthen their struggle against US imperialism. Recently, the US government's dispatch of aircraft to violate Soviet airspace and sabotage the four-power summit has made many people see clearly the two-faced tactics of US imperialism, which superficially pretends to be peaceful but actually insists on preparing for war, and see clearly its aggressive nature, thereby arousing great indignation and resolute struggle among peace-loving people of all countries in the world. This negative teacher, US imperialism, has promoted the struggle of the people of the world for world peace and human progress with its crimes of aggression. This role is indispensable and irreplaceable.

Recently, the chief representative of US imperialism, Eisenhower, delivered another radio address, attempting to defend the crimes of the United States in sending aircraft to invade the Soviet Union and sabotage the four-power summit. However, for the American people and the people of all countries in the world, this speech is a very persuasive negative teaching material. Eisenhower, this negative teacher, has given a beneficial lesson to the people of all countries.

What did Eisenhower say in this speech? He said:

First, "Our (referring to the United States, the same below) policy has not changed." "We have not relaxed our vigilance or lowered our guard."

Second, the US sending aircraft into the Soviet Union to collect intelligence is "essential" and "useful." "I take full responsibility for approving all the various plans of our government to collect and assess military intelligence."

Third, the initial statements made by the US government regarding the U-2 aircraft's intrusion into the Soviet Union were to "cover up the mission of this aircraft." That is to say, those statements were lies.

Fourth, the United States rejected Khrushchev's request made at the Paris meeting on May 16.

Fifth, Macmillan and De Gaulle "stood firmly with the US delegation" at the Paris meeting.

Sixth, "We must maintain our strength, and maintain it for a long time." "The composition and size of our forces have never been based on or influenced by the sweet words of the Soviet Union at any time. The same will be true in the future."

Seventh, the United States will "continue" to make "peaceful efforts," "including participating in the current negotiations with the Soviet Union."

Eighth, "We must promote constructive plans to improve the lives of people in emerging countries around the world (should be read as plans to enslave underdeveloped countries)." "We must not relax our common security (should be read as strengthening aggressive military blocs and expanding arms race) efforts."

From this mixture of defense and confession by Eisenhower, people can clearly see how US imperialism is playing two-faced tactics. Before the four-power summit, the United States, on the one hand, agreed to hold the four-power summit, and on the other hand, sent aircraft to carry out the sinister plan of invading Soviet airspace in preparation for war, and conducted global "alert exercises," deliberately sabotaging the four-power summit. After sabotaging the four-power summit, Eisenhower, on the one hand, announced that the US's aggressive policy and arms expansion policy have not changed and will continue to be implemented in the future, and on the other hand, expressed his intention to make "peaceful efforts" and negotiate with the Soviet Union. Eisenhower, on the one hand, announced the continued strengthening of military blocs and arms expansion, and intensified its control over its vassal states under the guise of "common security"; on the other hand, it promoted the reality of aggression and enslavement of underdeveloped countries in the name of "improving the lives of people in emerging countries." In this way, Eisenhower completely exposed how the United States has played, is playing, and will continue to play two-faced tactics. Eisenhower once again showed that he is a very competent negative teacher.

Lenin once said, "All oppressing classes, in order to maintain their rule, need two social functions: one is the function of the executioner, and the other is the function of the priest." US imperialism is exactly like this. In order to promote its aggressive plans and war plans, US imperialism has consistently used two tactics, one is peaceful deception, and the other is military violence. Not everyone sees these two tactics and their essence very clearly at all times. The "peaceful" posture of US imperialism, especially Eisenhower, this disguised "peace person," did indeed deceive some people, making them harbor illusions, as if the US policy had "changed," and they could not see that US imperialism, this wolf disguised as a grandmother, was originally a man-eating beast. Now, Eisenhower, in order to hide his fangs, has revealed his tail. This cannot but be a good thing. Eisenhower announced to the world: the US's aggressive policy and war policy have never changed, and will not change in the future. It cannot be denied that Eisenhower, this negative teacher, has given a very beneficial lesson to the people of all countries. He helps people recognize the aggressive nature of US imperialism and abandon unrealistic illusions about US imperialism.

This kind of frank self-exposure, of course, does not stem from Eisenhower's own wishes, but is the result of the irreconcilable contradictions inherent in the two-faced tactics of US imperialism itself. Inconsistency between words and deeds is the fatal weakness of US imperialism and all reactionaries. Since US imperialism pursues a policy of aggression and war, even if it can use the guise of "peace" to deceive some people for a while, it will eventually have to expose its true face of opposing peace and opposing the people of all countries. The famous American President Lincoln said more than a hundred years ago: "You can fool all the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time." But it seems that the contemporary US president and his colleagues have not followed the legacy of their sages. Although Eisenhower's "peace" cloak has been torn to shreds by himself, he is still trying to play his deceptive trick, shouting loudly: "We will continue these peaceful efforts." If his clumsy trick did not deceive many people in the past, then who can he deceive today after the true face of US imperialism has been further exposed?

Originally, those who are good at observing the international situation from the perspective of class analysis understand that it is necessary to understand imperialism from its essence rather than from superficial phenomena. Whether the US ruling group expresses its willingness to ease tensions or advocates creating tensions, expresses its support for peaceful coexistence or clamors for "preemptive strikes," expresses its willingness to negotiate or blatantly sabotages negotiations, although its strategies may have such or such changes, its basic policy will not change. Different strategies only serve its aggressive purpose of seeking hegemony in the world and enslaving the people of all countries.

There is a Chinese saying: "Listen to what he says and watch what he does." This is a good experience to help people identify the true and the false. US imperialism always uses some beautiful words to decorate its policy of aggression and war. In his radio address, did Eisenhower not shamelessly say that the US's expansion of armaments "is only committed to the goals of deterrence, defense, and retaliation, and has no intention of threatening or aggressing against anyone"? But the fact is: under the guise of "preventing sudden attacks" and "ensuring national defense," the United States is carrying out blatant provocations and aggressions against the Soviet Union. Does the intrusion of US spy planes into the Soviet Union to collect military intelligence not constitute a threat and aggression against the Soviet Union? Does the establishment of military bases and war exercises by the United States all over the world to show its "deterrent" power not constitute a threat to socialist countries and an aggression against those US vassal states? In his radio address, Eisenhower also greatly publicized the US's "constructive plans to improve the lives of people in emerging countries around the world" in order to "strengthen freedom." But what people see is how the United States uses the guise of "aid" to gradually intensify its control over underdeveloped countries, making them in a miserable situation of poverty. Is not the current situation in Turkey, the country that receives the most "US aid," the biggest irony to the US's hyped-up "common security plan"? Is not the breaking of the "democratic showcase" of South Korea enough to illustrate what kind of stuff the "freedom" in the "free world" that the United States is trying to strengthen is? It can be seen that for US imperialism, people must never judge its policy from its words, but from its actions, not from some individual superficial phenomena, but from the essence of a large number of facts, based on the perspective of class analysis, and determine their own countermeasures accordingly. Only in this way can we avoid, as Lenin pointed out: "Opportunism means sacrificing the fundamental interests of the proletariat to secure temporary advantages or imaginary advantages, making temporary accommodations, adjusting to passing events, and paying attention to small political turns, forgetting the fundamental interests of the proletariat and forgetting the basic characteristics of the entire capitalist system and the entire capitalist evolution."

Since the aggressive nature of US imperialism will not change, and since US imperialism always plays the two-faced tactics of "false relaxation, real war preparation, false peace, real aggression," all peace-loving people must resolutely expose the "peace" conspiracies of US imperialism and mobilize the broad masses to rise up and struggle against the aggressive and war plots of US imperialism. In this regard, US imperialism and all reactionaries are negative teachers, and they can give us great help, because their inevitable self-exposure will constantly provide convincing negative teaching materials to the people of all countries. We must make full use of their role, more effectively raise the awareness of the masses of the people, and make them unite more closely to strengthen the struggle against imperialism headed by the United States, against imperialist war, and against imperialist aggression. We firmly believe that relying on the unity and struggle of all peace-loving people in the world, especially the people of socialist countries, we will surely be able to crush the aggressive plans and war plans of imperialism and achieve lasting world peace.

### 反面教员

专栏：社论

    反面教员
    “没有革命的理论，就不会有革命的运动。”“理论一旦掌握了群众，便立刻成为物质的力量。”这两句马克思列宁主义的名言，对于目前正在为世界和平、民族独立、民主自由和社会主义事业而斗争的人们，是多么亲切啊！
    最近一个时期，从全世界各个角落不断传来了斗争的信息。正有越来越多的人们看清了或者更加看清了帝国主义和各国反动派的真面目，反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争真是风起云涌。毛主席说，“帝国主义最怕的是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民觉悟，怕世界各国人民的觉悟。”现在正是全世界人民日益觉悟的时代。马克思列宁主义认为，美帝国主义及其走狗是永不会改变它们的本性的，它们是世界和平事业的最凶恶的敌人，是世界各国人民最凶恶的敌人。只有对它们进行坚决的斗争，才能维护世界和平。马克思列宁主义的这个真理，正为越来越多的人所掌握，迅速成为冲击美帝国主义及其走狗的阵地的强大的力量。
    马克思列宁主义的真理之所以能够吸引越来越广泛的人民群众，激发他们的觉悟和斗争，一方面固然有赖于先进的人们广为传播，另一方面还要借助于美帝国主义及其走狗从反面来教育人民群众。正面的教育，在开始的时候，对许多人来说是“将信将疑”的。有了正面的教育，又有了反面的教育，人们就可以比较，也就有可能较为容易地接受真理了。正因为这个原故，毛泽东同志一直强调指出，反面教员在许多情况下起着任何别人都起不了的特殊作用。
    在各国人民革命斗争的历史上，关于反面教员的特殊作用的事例不胜枚举。眼前就有许多活生生的事实，例如：正是李承晚、曼德列斯、岸信介之流的卖国的法西斯的反动统治，激起了南朝鲜人民、土耳其人民和日本人民的英勇斗争。李承晚和曼德列斯已经倒台，岸信介也摇摇欲坠。他们都是人民群众的反面教员。
    全世界天字第一号反面教员是美帝国主义。因为它在全世界到处进行侵略，侵犯和蹂躏许多国家的领土主权，剥削和掠夺许多国家的人民，真是横行霸道，无恶不作。这就不能不激发各国人民的觉悟，迫使他们不能不起来加强对美帝国主义的斗争。最近美国政府派遣飞机侵犯苏联领空和破坏四国首脑会议，使许多人看清了美帝国主义表面上伪装和平、实际上坚持备战的两面手法，看清了它的侵略本质，从而激起了世界各国爱好和平人民的极大的愤慨和坚决的斗争。美帝国主义这个反面教员，用它的侵略罪行促进了世界人民为世界和平和人类进步事业的斗争，这种作用是不可缺少而又无可代替的。
    最近，美帝国主义的首席代表艾森豪威尔又发表了一篇广播演说，企图为美国派遣飞机侵犯苏联和破坏四国首脑会议的罪行辩解。但是，对于美国人民和全世界各国人民来说，这篇演说却是非常有说服力的反面教材。艾森豪威尔这个反面教员，又给各国人民上了有益的一课。
    艾森豪威尔在这篇演说中说了些什么呢？他说：
    第一，“我们（指美国，下同）的政策也没有改变”。“我们并没有放松戒备或者放松警惕”。
    第二，美国派遣飞机侵入苏联去搜集情报是“必不可少的”，“有用的”。“我对批准我国政府进行的所有各种搜集和估计军事情报的计划担负完全的责任”。
    第三，美国政府最初就U—2型飞机侵入苏联发表的声明，为的是“掩饰这架飞机的使命”。也就是说，那些声明是撒谎的。
    第四，美国拒绝赫鲁晓夫5月16日在巴黎会议上提出的要求。
    第五，麦克米伦和戴高乐在巴黎会议上“都坚决同美国代表团站在一起”。
    第六，“我们必须保持我们的实力，并且长期保持下去”。“我们部队的组成和规模任何时候都没有以苏联的甜言蜜语为基础，或者受这种甜言蜜语的影响。以后也是如此”。
    第七，美国将“继续进行”“和平努力”，“包括参加目前同苏联进行的谈判”。
    第八，“我们必须在全世界推行改善新兴国家人民生活的建设性计划（应读作奴役不发达国家的计划）”。“我们决不能放松我们的共同安全（应读作加强侵略性军事集团和扩军备战）努力。”
    从艾森豪威尔这个辩护词和供状的混合物中，人们可以清楚地看到美帝国主义怎样玩弄两面手法。在四国首脑会议之前，美国一方面同意召开四国首脑会议，另一方面又派遣飞机执行为准备战争而侵入苏联领空的罪恶计划，并且进行全球性的“戒备演习”，蓄意破坏四国首脑会议。在破坏四国首脑会议以后，艾森豪威尔一方面宣布美国的侵略政策和扩军备战政策没有改变，以后也仍然继续推行，另一方面又表示要进行“和平努力”，同苏联谈判。艾森豪威尔一方面宣布继续加强军事集团和扩军备战，在“共同安全”的借口下加紧对其仆从国家的控制；另一方面又以“改善新兴国家人民生活”为名，推行侵略和奴役不发达国家之实。这样，艾森豪威尔就完全暴露了美国过去曾经、现在正在而且将来还要玩弄两面手法。艾森豪威尔又一次表明了他是一个十分称职的反面教员。　
    列宁曾经说过，“所有一切压迫阶级，为了维持自己的统治，都需要有两种社会职能：一种是刽子手的职能，一种是神甫的职能。”美帝国主义正是这样。美帝国主义为了推行它的侵略计划和战争计划，一贯地使用两种手法，一种是和平欺骗，一种是军事暴力。对于这两种手法和它们的实质，并不是所有的人在任何时候都看得很清楚的。美帝国主义的“和平”姿态，特别是艾森豪威尔这一个伪装的“和平人士”，的确曾经迷惑一些人，使他们抱有幻想，似乎美国的政策“改变了”，看不出美帝国主义这个作外婆打扮的豺狼原来是一只吃人的野兽。现在，艾森豪威尔为了掩藏自己的獠牙，却把尾巴露出来了。这不能不是一件好事。艾森豪威尔向全世界宣布：美国的侵略政策和战争政策从来没有改变，而且将来也不会改变。不能不认为，艾森豪威尔这位反面教员给各国人民上了很有益的一课。他帮助人们认识美帝国主义的侵略本性，抛掉对美帝国主义的不切实际的幻想。
    这种坦率的自我暴露，当然并不是出自艾森豪威尔的本愿，而是由于美帝国主义两面手法本身包含着不可克服的矛盾的结果。言行不符，这是美帝国主义和一切反动派的致命弱点。美帝国主义既然奉行的是侵略政策和战争政策，它即使能够用“和平”的伪装迷惑某些人于一时，终究不能不暴露出自己反对和平和反对各国人民的真面目。美国著名的总统林肯在一百多年前说得对：“你可以在一个时候欺骗所有的人，或者在所有的时候欺骗一些人，但是你不能在所有的时候欺骗所有的人”。但是看来当代的美国总统和他的同僚并没有遵循他们的先哲的遗训。虽然艾森豪威尔的“和平”外衣已经被自己扯破得不成样子了，但是他仍然企图玩弄他的骗人把戏，高声呼叫：“我们将继续进行这些和平的努力”。如果他的这套拙劣的把戏过去就没有能迷惑多少人，那么在今天美帝国主义的真面目又进一步暴露了以后，还能骗得过谁呢？
    本来，善于从阶级分析的观点来观察国际形势的人，是懂得必须从本质而不是从表面现象来认识帝国主义的。不论美国统治集团表示愿意和缓还是鼓吹制造紧张，表示赞成和平共处还是叫嚣“先发制人”，表示愿意谈判还是悍然破坏谈判，尽管它的策略会有这样或那样的变化，但是它的基本政策是不会改变的，不同的策略都只是服务于它称霸全世界、奴役各国人民的侵略目的。
    中国有一句格言：“听其言而观其行”。这是帮助人们识别真伪的一条好经验。美帝国主义总是用一些漂亮的词句来装璜它的侵略和战争政策的。艾森豪威尔在他的这次广播演说中，不是仍然大言不惭地说什么美国的扩充军备“只是致力于威慑的、防御的和报复的目标的，对任何人都没有威胁或侵略意图”的吗？但是事实却是：美国在“防止突袭”、“保障国防”之类的借口下，对苏联进行着明目张胆的挑衅和侵略。难道美国的间谍飞机侵入苏联收集军事情报，还不构成对苏联的威胁和侵略吗？美国在世界各地遍设军事基地、进行战争演习来显示它的“威慑”力量，难道不是对社会主义国家的威胁和对那些美国的仆从国家的侵略吗？艾森豪威尔在广播演说中也大事宣扬美国为了“加强自由”而“在全世界推行改善新兴国家人民生活的建设性计划”。但是人们看到的却是，美国如何利用“援助”的幌子步步加紧对不发达国家的控制，使它们处于民穷财尽的悲惨境地。接受“美援”最多的土耳其今天的状况不就是对美国吹的天花乱坠的“共同安全计划”最大的讽刺吗？南朝鲜这个“民主橱窗”的破碎难道还不足以说明美国所努力加强的“自由世界”中的“自由”是什么样的货色吗？可见，对于美帝国主义，人们绝对不能从它的言词，而要根据它的行动，不能从某些个别的表面现象，而要从大量的事实的本质，根据阶级分析的观点，来判断它的政策，并据以确定自己的对策。只有这样，才不致像列宁所指出的那样：“临时应付，迁就眼前事变，迁就细小政治变动，忘记无产阶级底根本利益，忘记整个资本主义制度，整个资本主义演变底基本特点，为谋暂时的实际利益或想像中的利益而牺牲无产阶级底根本利益”。
    既然美帝国主义的侵略本性是不会改变的，既然美帝国主义总是要玩弄“假和缓、真备战，假和平、真侵略”的两面手法，一切爱好和平的人们就必须坚决揭露美帝国主义的“和平”诡计，动员广大群众起来同美帝国主义的侵略和战争阴谋进行斗争。在这方面，美帝国主义和一切反动派都是反面教员，他们能够给我们很大的帮助，因为他们无可避免的自我暴露，会不断地对各国人民提供令人信服的反面教材。我们必须充分利用他们的这种作用，更有成效地提高人民群众的觉悟，使他们更加紧密地团结起来，加强反对以美国为首的帝国主义、反对帝国主义战争、反对帝国主义侵略的斗争。我们坚信，依靠全世界一切爱好和平人民、首先是社会主义各国人民的团结和斗争，就一定能够粉碎帝国主义的侵略计划和战争计划，取得世界的持久和平。
