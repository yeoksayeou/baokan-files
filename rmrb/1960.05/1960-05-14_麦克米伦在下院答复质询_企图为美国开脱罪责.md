Xinhua News Agency, London, May 12th - Amidst strong unease and indignation among the British public regarding the provocative incident of an American aircraft conducting espionage activities in Soviet airspace, the British government was compelled to address this issue during the foreign policy debate in the House of Commons today.

Following Khrushchev's warning to countries providing bases for American espionage flights, some Labour Party members questioned the government in the House of Commons on May 11th. Labour MP Hughes inquired about the extent of possible cooperation between the British and American air forces in reconnaissance of Soviet air force and military bases. Labour MP Swingler raised questions of a similar nature.

Macmillan addressed this matter very briefly at the conclusion of the House of Commons debate. He did not express any criticism of this heinous American activity, but instead attempted to exonerate the United States, stating that American "espionage is not the cause of suspicion and tension between great powers, but rather its consequence."

    麦克米伦在下院答复质询 
    企图为美国开脱罪责
    据新华社伦敦12日电　在英国公众对美国飞机在苏联领空进行间谍活动的挑衅事件强烈不安和愤慨的情绪下，英国政府今天在下院的外交政策辩论中被迫谈到这一问题。
    在赫鲁晓夫向提供基地给美国从事间谍飞行的国家提出警告以后，一些工党议员11日在下院向政府提出质询。工党议员休斯问道，英国和美国空军在侦察苏联空军和军事基地方面可能合作到什么程度。工党议员斯文格勒提出了同样性质的问题。
    麦克米伦在下院辩论结束时十分简短地谈到这件事。他对美国这种罪恶活动丝毫不加指责，却为美国开脱罪责，说什么美国“间谍活动不是大国之间猜疑和紧张关系的原因，而是它的后果。”
