Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 27th: The "National Council to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty," composed of 140 Japanese political parties and mass organizations, decided at today's meeting of its executive committee to concentrate its efforts on preparing for a general strike on June 4th. The general strike has two objectives: to overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet and to dissolve the Diet. According to the struggle plan adopted today, the various organizations affiliated with the "National Council to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty" will strengthen various forms of activities, such as distributing leaflets, holding street rallies, and launching a fundraising campaign for the struggle to prevent revision of the "Security Treaty." The plan emphasizes mobilizing large numbers of workers to conduct signature campaigns in the streets and through door-to-door visits.

The struggle plan points out that it is of great significance that cultural leaders speak at street rallies and that prominent figures issue statements supporting the workers' general strike.

According to the struggle plan, the National Council will mobilize at least 3,000 demonstrators daily to protest at Nobusuke Kishi's official residence, private home, and the Diet against Kishi's forcing the Diet to "pass" the new "Security Treaty."

The struggle plan also suggests holding a large-scale mass rally in Tokyo on June 2nd, demanding the resignation of the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet, the dissolution of the Diet, and the abolition of the new "Security Treaty." People from all walks of life will participate in this mass rally.

The "National Council to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty" issued a statement today saying that the 16th unified action against the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" held yesterday achieved an unprecedented victory.

The statement said, "The number of people participating in the demonstrations yesterday far exceeded the number expected by the National Council to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty. This once again proves how strong public opinion is demanding the abolition of the Security Treaty and the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet."

The statement said that in Tokyo, more than 200,000 people petitioned the Diet against the "Security Treaty" and held powerful demonstrations. This in itself is a great victory.

The statement pointed out, "One of the characteristics of yesterday's unified action was the voluntary participation of individual citizens in the demonstrations against the Security Treaty, which is a guarantee of the victory of our movement against the Japan-U.S. military treaty. On the other hand, this action dealt a heavy blow to the enemies of the people."

The statement protested against the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department's threat to arrest the leaders of yesterday's demonstration. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department had said that yesterday's demonstration was "illegal" because no application had been submitted to the police department regarding the demonstration beforehand.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 27th: The Central Executive Committee of the Japan Socialist Party decided this morning that, starting tomorrow, members of the Socialist Party's House of Representatives and House of Councillors will return to their respective constituencies to participate in the struggles of the people in various regions and prepare for the general strike to be held on June 4th.

The Socialist Party believes that the large-scale demonstration of 200,000 people surrounding the Diet yesterday was a great success.

The Socialist Party has decided that it will continue to refuse to participate in deliberations in the Diet and continue to carry out mass struggles outside the Diet in accordance with its established policy.

Ichiro Asanuma, Chairman of the Japan Socialist Party, spoke at a three-party leaders' symposium held by the Japan Broadcasting Corporation today, again demanding the resignation of the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet and the immediate dissolution of the Diet.

    日本“国民会议”全力准备总罢工
    社会党议员分赴全国各地动员群众参加斗争
    新华社27日讯　东京消息：日本一百四十个政党和群众团体组织成的“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”今天在干事会会议上决定集中力量，准备在6月4日举行总罢工，总罢工有两个目的——推翻岸信介内阁和解散国会。根据今天通过的斗争方针，“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”所属的各个组织将加强各种形式的活动，例如散发传单，举行街头集会和展开为阻止修改“安全条约”的斗争募款的运动等。方针强调要发动大批工人在街道上和通过挨户访问方式展开征集签名运动。
    斗争方针指出，文化界领袖在街头集会上讲话和著名人士发表声明支持工人的总罢工是有重大意义的。
    根据斗争方针，国民会议每天至少要动员三千名示威者到岸信介的官邸和私人住宅以及国会去抗议岸信介强使国会“通过”新“安全条约”。
    斗争方针还建议6月2日在东京举行大规模的群众集会，要求岸信介内阁总辞职，解散国会和废除新“安全条约”。参加这次群众大会的将有各阶层人民。
    “阻止修改安全条约国民会议”今天发表声明说，昨天举行的第十六次反对新日美“安全条约”统一行动取得了空前的胜利。
    声明说，“昨天参加示威的人数远远超过阻止修改安全条约国民会议所预期的人数。这再一次证明，要求废除安全条约以及要求解散国会和岸信介内阁辞职的舆论是多么强大。”
    声明说，在东京，有二十多万人向国会请愿反对“安全条约”，并举行了有力的示威。这个事情本身就是伟大的胜利。
    声明指出，“昨天统一行动的特点之一是市民个人自愿地参加反对安全条约的示威，这是我们反对日美军事条约的运动胜利的保证。另一方面，这个行动沉重地打击了人民的敌人。”
    声明对东京警视厅威胁要逮捕昨天的示威领导人，表示抗议。东京警视厅曾经说，昨天的示威是“非法的”，因为事前没有就示威的事情向警视厅提出申请。
    新华社27日讯　东京消息：日本社会党中央执行委员会今天上午决定，从明天起社会党众参两院的议员将回到各个选区去参加各地人民的斗争，并准备6月4日举行的总罢工。
    社会党认为，昨天包围国会的二十万人大示威获得了非常大的成功。
    社会党决定，今后它将按照既定方针，在国会内拒绝参加审议，在国会外继续展开群众斗争。
    日本社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎今天在日本广播协会举办的三党首脑座谈会上发表谈话，再次要求岸信介内阁总辞职和立即解散国会。
