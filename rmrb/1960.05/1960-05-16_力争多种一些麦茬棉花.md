Strive to Plant More Wheat Stubble Cotton
By People's Daily Commentator

The cotton planting work across the country has achieved great victories. However, to ensure the 100% completion and over-fulfillment of the planting plan, we must persevere and make significant efforts at the final moment.

To plant enough cotton, the first priority is to plant enough primary crop cotton. Currently, in the northern cotton-growing areas, it is still the season for planting primary crop cotton. Of course, the cotton in these areas is best planted before the Beginning of Summer (立夏); however, if restricted by various conditions and it is not possible to finish planting before the Beginning of Summer, we should still seize the last opportunity before Grain Full (小满) and strive to complete the primary crop cotton planting plan. In areas where the primary crop cotton has been planted according to plan, if there are conditions to plant more, we should plant more primary crop cotton beyond the plan for "insurance." For example, Shaanxi Province's proposal to plant an additional 50,000 mu of cotton beyond the plan is a very good approach. Only by planting enough primary crop cotton first can the completion of the total cotton production plan be most reliably guaranteed.

In the southern cotton-growing areas, where the primary crop cotton planting task has been completed, if conditions genuinely do not permit planting more primary crop cotton, we should, on the one hand, check and replant seedlings and strengthen cotton field management, and on the other hand, plant more wheat ridge cotton, wheat stubble cotton, and other second-crop cotton beyond the plan. In the northern cotton-growing areas, while striving to complete and over-fulfill the primary crop cotton planting plan, if conditions permit, we should also use strip planting or spot planting to plant more wheat ridge cotton beyond the plan. Although the unit yield of second-crop cotton is generally lower than that of primary crop cotton, after the primary crop cotton has been planted sufficiently, planting more second-crop cotton is still a force worth emphasizing to ensure the completion and over-fulfillment of the annual total cotton production plan. Moreover, with careful cultivation, the yield of second-crop cotton can also be greatly increased.

The only correct attitude towards second-crop cotton is this: on the one hand, we do not advocate using the method of planting more second-crop cotton to replace primary crop cotton; on the other hand, under the condition of striving to plant more primary crop cotton, we advocate planting as much second-crop cotton as possible. On the one hand, we must consider that the unit yield of second-crop cotton is relatively low; on the other hand, we must fully utilize the subjective initiative of people to make the unit yield of second-crop cotton catch up with that of primary crop cotton.

In our country, the area where cotton and other crops are rotated twice a year has always accounted for about 30% of the total cotton field area. The vast majority is distributed in the Yangtze River basin; in recent years, it has also developed in the Yellow River basin and local areas of northern Anhui. As a way to make full use of the land, as a supplement to over-fulfilling the cotton production task, and as an effort to actively strive to increase cotton production, planting more second-crop cotton is something that should be done. Of course, the same thing is another matter entirely if it is intended as a "stopgap" measure to replace the area of primary crop cotton. The most important point is what is the starting point: is it an active and enterprising revolutionary spirit? Or is it a passive and shrinking fear of difficulty? As long as we truly embrace an active and enterprising spirit to plant more second-crop cotton beyond the plan, we will not only be able to further expand the cotton planting area, but also be able to increase the cotton unit yield.

There are three ways to rotate cotton and other crops twice a year: the best strategy is seedling cultivation and transplanting; the middle strategy is intercropping; and the worst strategy is sowing after the harvest of the previous crop. Of course, we should strive for the best strategy. Nutrient bowl seedling cultivation and block seedling cultivation are both very good methods. It is still not too late to cultivate seedlings now. By adopting this method, cultivating good seedlings, and transplanting them in time after the harvest of barley, wheat, peas, rapeseed, etc., the unit yield of cotton can completely reach the level of primary crop cotton; in the past, some high-yield examples have already appeared in Zhejiang, Hubei, and other places, and even more cases have exceeded the national average cotton yield per mu. However, this method requires more labor. This problem can be largely solved by relying on technological innovation. Seedling cultivation can be carried out with large-scale technological innovation to promote strong and fast-growing cotton seedlings; seedling transplanting and planting can also be carried out with large-scale improvement of tools and semi-mechanized tools.

If restricted by conditions and it is indeed impossible to adopt the method of seedling cultivation and transplanting, we should strive for intercropping and plant more wheat ridge cotton. This method can be adopted wherever the wheat rows are wider. Time is of the essence, and we must start immediately, or it will be too late. By doing so, as long as we strengthen field management, irrigate and fertilize in a timely manner, we can ensure that the yield of wheat is not affected, and cotton also achieves a good harvest. There have also been many cases of intercropping cotton and obtaining higher yields in the past. Technological innovation can also be carried out on a large scale in the sowing and field management of intercropped cotton.

If restricted by conditions, there are no pre-cultivated seedlings, and there is no suitable land for intercropping, if local climate and other conditions permit, cotton can also be planted after the harvest of wheat, rapeseed, etc. In this case, we still need to adopt an active and enterprising spirit: select early-maturing varieties, improve seed treatment to achieve early emergence and early maturity, and strengthen field management after emergence to promote rapid growth. In short, on the one hand, we must strive for the best strategy; on the other hand, in any case, we must promote the revolutionary spirit and strive to transform unfavorable conditions into favorable conditions.

    力争多种一些麦茬棉花
    本报评论员
    全国各地的棉花播种工作，已经取得很大的胜利。但是，要确保百分之百地完成和超额完成播种计划，还须在最后关头坚持不懈地作重大的努力。
    棉花必须种足，首先是要把正茬棉花种足。目前，在北方棉区，还是正茬棉花播种季节。这些地区的棉花，当然最好是在立夏以前种完；可是，如果受种种条件限制，立夏前未能种完，还应该争取小满以前的最后时机，努力完成正茬棉花播种计划。在正茬棉花按计划已经种足的地方，如果还有条件多种，应该超计划再多种些正茬棉花，以求“保险”。例如陕西省提出在计划之外多种五万亩棉花，就是一个很好的办法，只有先把正茬棉花种足，棉花总产量计划的完成才有最可靠的保证。
    在南方棉区，正茬棉花播种任务已经完成的，如果的确条件不许可再多种正茬棉花，就应该一方面查苗补苗，加强棉田管理，另方面在计划之外多种麦垅花、麦茬花和其它回茬棉花。北方棉区在力求完成和超额完成正茬棉花播种计划的同时，如果条件许可，现在也应该用条播或点播的办法，超计划多种一些麦垅花。回茬棉花的单位产量虽然一般地说不如正茬棉花高，但是，在正茬棉花已经种足之后，再多种回茬棉花，对于确保完成和超额完成全年的棉花总产量计划仍然是一支值得重视的力量。何况，只要精心培育，回茬棉花也能大大提高产量。
    对于回茬棉花，只有采取这样的态度才是正确的：一方面，不提倡用多种回茬棉花的办法来顶替正茬棉花；另方面，在尽力多种正茬棉花的条件下，又提倡尽可能多种一些回茬棉花。一方面，要估计到回茬棉花单位产量较低；另方面，要充分发挥人的主观能动作用，使回茬棉花的单位产量向正茬棉花看齐。
    我国棉花和别的作物接茬一年两熟的面积，一向大约占棉田总面积的30％左右。绝大部分分布在长江流域；近几年在黄河流域和淮北局部地区也有所发展。作为充分利用土地的一项办法，作为超计划完成棉花生产任务的一个补充，作为积极争取增产更多棉花的一种努力，多种一些回茬棉花是应该的。当然，同样一件事情，如果是作为顶替正茬棉花面积的“凑数”的打算，那就是另外一回事了。最重要之点就在于出发点是什么：是积极进取的革命精神？是消极退缩的畏难情绪？只要真正是抱着积极进取的精神超计划地多种回茬棉花，那末，不但能够进一步扩大棉花种植面积，并且同样能够提高棉花单位产量。
    棉花和其它作物接茬一年两熟的办法有三种：上策是育苗移栽；中策是行间套种；下策是前茬收获之后再播种。当然应该力争上策。营养钵育苗、方块育苗都是很好的办法。现在育苗也还来得及。采取这种方法，育好了苗，等大麦、小麦、豌豆、油菜等收获之后及时移栽，棉花的单位产量完全可以达到正茬棉花的水平；过去，浙江、湖北等地已经出现过一些高额丰产事例，亩产超过全国棉花平均亩产量的就更多了。不过，采用这种办法要用比较多的劳动力。这个问题可以依靠技术革新来解决一大部分。育苗可以大搞技术革新，促使棉苗茁壮、生长迅速；移苗定植，也可以大搞改良工具和半机械化工具。
    如果受条件限制，的确不可能采用育苗移栽的办法，就要力求套种，多种麦垅花。凡是麦行较宽的地方，都可以采用这个办法。事不宜迟，现在就要马上动手，再迟就不行了。这样做，只要加强田间管理，适时灌溉追肥，可以做到对麦子的产量不发生影响，棉花也获得丰收。套种棉花而获得较高产的事例，过去也有不少。在套种棉花的播种和田间管理方面，同样也可以大搞技术革新。
    如果受条件限制，没有事先育苗，也没有适宜套种的地，如果当地气候等条件许可，还可以在麦子、油菜等等收获之后再播种棉花。在这种情况下，也还是要采取积极进取的精神：选用早熟品种，改进种子处理以求早出苗、早成熟，出苗之后加强田间管理促使快速成长。总之，一方面要力求上策；另方面，在任何情况下都要发扬革命精神，力求转化不利条件为有利条件。
