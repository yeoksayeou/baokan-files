Various Regions and Types of Farmland Must Comprehensively Increase Production
Hubei and Shaanxi Vigorously Implement Measures to Transform Low-Yield Areas and Low-Yield Farmland

(Our dispatch) Hubei Province's broad masses of cadres and people, during the spring plowing season, are vigorously transforming low-yield areas and low-yield crops, striving to achieve comprehensive and balanced agricultural production increases this year.

Currently, Hubei Province's mass movement to achieve large-scale balanced production increases has unfolded vigorously. In many areas, cadres and the masses are meeting in the fields, planning and acting simultaneously, rapidly launching an unprecedented upsurge in the competition of mountainous areas catching up with plains, low yields catching up with high yields, and coarse grains catching up with staple grains. Of Hubei Province's more than 60 million mu of cultivated land, low-yield farmland accounts for approximately 15 million mu, with yields generally 50% lower or more than those of high-yield farmland. The disparity in yields between various crops is also significant. Nearly a quarter of the province's rice yields are relatively low, with an average yield of only around 300 jin per mu. To change this situation, Party committees at all levels, following the spirit of the Provincial Party Committee's instructions, are planting red flags widely, establishing pacesetters, and mobilizing the backward to catch up with the advanced. The following measures are generally adopted in various regions: 1. Cadres and the masses go deep into the fields to find backwardness, investigate the causes, and formulate plans to eliminate backwardness within a set time limit; 2. Focus on all aspects of production, especially ensuring successful sowing, eliminating backward seedlings during the sowing period; 3. Strengthen leadership, implementing the "Five To The Field" system: leadership, labor, time, work points, and rewards and punishments; 4. Vigorously establish high-yield demonstration plots, high-yield demonstration zones, and high-yield demonstration rows; 5. Vigorously engage in basic construction of water, fertilizer, and soil; 6. Organize various forces to vigorously provide support.

Under the guidance of the policy of "taking grain as the key link and promoting all-round development," various regions, based on the phenomenon of unbalanced production increases in previous years, have proposed general targets for balanced production increases for various crops, including grain, cotton, oil, hemp, silk, tea, sugar, vegetables, tobacco, fruits, medicinal herbs, and miscellaneous crops, and have analyzed and criticized the erroneous thinking existing among some cadres and the masses. For example, some people in the Wuduhe Commune of Yichang originally believed that corn didn't bring much profit and cultivated it carelessly. After mobilizing the masses to criticize this thinking, the entire commune, with production teams as units, concentrated 2,000 cadres and 9,000 commune members, camped out, and fought a major battle against backward farmland. In a few days, they transformed 910 slopes and more than 1,100 ridges. The more than 8,900 mu of corn sown generally met the quality standards.

Through carrying out the large-scale balanced production increase movement, not only have all "theory of conditions" and "theory of backwardness" been swept away, enabling cadres and the masses in areas with relatively backward production to break superstitions, liberate their minds, and rapidly launch an upsurge in learning from the advanced and catching up with the advanced, but also many regions have adopted methods of section-by-section inspection and section-by-section ranking, so that the development of production moves from imbalance to balance, and from balance to a new imbalance, thereby pushing the production movement from one upsurge to another new upsurge.

The large-scale balanced production increase movement is a concrete application of the working method of "grasping the two ends and bringing along the middle." In this movement, various regions pay great attention to grasping advanced models, planting red flags widely, establishing pacesetters, and promptly summarizing and promoting advanced experiences. At the same time, based on past experience, various regions have also adopted the methods of sending cadres down and assigning responsibilities at each level to strengthen specific leadership over backward areas. Shishou County alone recently drew 5 county party committee members and more than 300 cadres to organize 43 work groups to strengthen leadership in production teams with a relatively poor work foundation. The secretary of the Hong'an County Party Committee personally led more than 400 cadres and the masses in a four-day battle to double the depth of the soil layer, which was originally only four inches deep, on more than 100 mu of land, and established a high-yield peanut demonstration row.

Due to the development of the large-scale balanced production increase movement, Hubei Province's spring sowing production has seen a great situation of horses galloping and a thousand miles a day, and the sowing of various crops is faster and better. The transplanting of early rice in the province has basically ended, and the sowing of mid-season rice has also basically ended, and seedling management is being strengthened. The sowing of coarse grains and cash crops is better than in any year in history. The planting of more than 8 million mu of cotton in the province has been completed.

(Our dispatch) Mountainous and high-yuan hilly areas of Shaanxi Province are vigorously reforming agricultural techniques and improving the quality of spring sowing, determined to transform low-yield areas and low-yield farmland into high-yield areas and high-yield farmland, and achieve comprehensive and balanced production increases in agriculture.

The spring sowing area in the Qinling and Bashan mountainous areas in southern Shaanxi and the high-yuan hilly areas in northern Shaanxi accounts for more than 70% of the province's spring-sown grain area, but the crop yields in these areas are generally low. Therefore, improving the production level in these areas is of great strategic significance. Currently, the people in the mountainous areas are vigorously carrying out a movement to reform and revolutionize cultivation techniques around spring sowing. Various regions have generally proposed that spring sowing should achieve "six reforms," namely, changing sowing on hard stubble to sowing after deep plowing and careful preparation; changing sowing on bare ground to sowing with base fertilizer; changing broadcasting to row sowing; changing mixed varieties to improved varieties; changing single-season crops to intercropping; and changing low-yield crops to high-yield crops. In order to comprehensively promote agricultural technology reform, various regions have trained a large number of agricultural technicians and local experts. Shangnan and Shangxian in the Qinling Mountains have trained a large number of tuber technicians, Zhen'an has trained corn technicians, and Yulin Prefecture has also held a potato yield increase on-site meeting to spread potato yield increase experience. As of May 6, spring sowing in mountainous and high-yuan areas had been completed on more than 8.21 million mu. This year, these areas have generally deep-plowed the land, generally deep-plowing about six inches, implementing meticulous land preparation and eliminating sowing on hard stubble; generally applying sufficient base fertilizer, generally applying about 3,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu in high mountain areas, and 10,000 to 15,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu in high-yield fields, thoroughly eliminating sowing bare seeds. This year, improved varieties account for about 90% in mountainous and high-yuan hilly areas. Various regions have also greatly expanded the area of high-yield crops, with tubers alone increasing by more than double compared to last year. The sowing method has also generally changed from broadcasting to row sowing, increasing the sowing amount by about 20% compared to previous years to achieve rational close planting.

In reforming agricultural techniques, various regions have created many new tools suitable for mountainous and high-yuan areas. To adapt to slope transportation, the masses in Zhen'an County created a soil cart with small front wheels and large rear wheels that is easy to climb slopes, which can transport fertilizer and crops. There is also an artificial rain sprinkler that irrigates evenly and avoids eroding the soil. This rain sprinkler only requires one person to operate and can irrigate four mu of slope land in one day. In order to solve the problem of fertilization in high mountain areas, counties in the Qinling Mountains have generally established local soil fertilizer plants, smoking fertilizer pits, and composting ponds to solve the difficulty of transporting fertilizer. The high-yuan areas in northern Shaanxi also generally adopt methods such as making fertilizer locally and moving pig pens and sheep pens to the mountains to solve the fertilizer problem.

Currently, a massive high-mountain catching up with shallow mountain, mountainous areas catching up with plain areas bumper harvest movement has already taken shape in mountainous and high-yuan areas. Various communes in mountainous and high-yuan hilly areas have generally established various high-yield fields. Each county in Jian'an Prefecture has established more than 2.11 million mu of high-yield fields. Party committees at all levels have strengthened leadership over high-yield fields, and special personnel are responsible for the management of various high-yield fields, and file systems have been established separately.

    各种地区各类田土都要全面增产
    湖北陕西狠抓措施大力改造低产区低产田
    本报讯　湖北省广大干部群众在春耕中，大力改造低产地区和低产作物，力争实现今年农业生产全面平衡增产。
    目前，湖北省为实现大面积平衡增产的群众运动，已经轰轰烈烈展开。许多地区的干部群众会师田间，边规划，边行动，迅速掀起了空前规模的山区赶平原、低产赶高产、杂粮赶主粮的竞赛热潮。湖北省六千多万亩耕地中，低产田约有一千五百万亩，产量一般比高产田低50％或者更多；各种作物之间产量悬殊也很大，全省有近四分之一的水稻产量较低，平均亩产只有三百斤左右。为了改变这种情况，各级党委根据省委指示精神，大插红旗，广树标兵，发动落后赶先进。各地一般采取了以下几项措施：一、干部群众深入田间，找落后，查原因，订出规划，限期消灭落后；二、抓好各个生产环节，特别要过好播种关，把落后苗消灭在播种期；三、加强领导，实现领导、劳力、时间、工分、奖惩、“五到田”；四、大办丰产畈、丰产片、丰产岗；五、大搞水、肥、土等基本建设；六、组织各方面的力量大力支援。
    各地在“以粮为纲，全面发展”的方针指导下，根据历年增产不平衡的现象，对粮、棉、油、麻、丝、茶、糖、菜、烟、果、药、杂各类作物，都分别提出了平衡增产的大体指标，并分析批判了在部分干部、群众中存在的错误思想。如宜昌雾渡河公社原来有些人认为苞谷油水不大，耕作粗放。经发动群众批判这种思想后，全社以生产队为单位，集中了两千干部和九千名社员，安营扎寨，大战落后田，几天时间就改造了九百一十个坡，一千一百多条岗，播下的八千九百多亩苞谷，一般都达到了质量标准。
    通过开展大面积平衡增产运动，不仅横扫了一切“唯条件论”、“落后论”，使生产比较落后地区的干部、群众，破除迷信、解放思想，迅速掀起学先进赶先进的热潮。同时，许多地区还采取段段检查，段段排队的方法，使生产的发展由不平衡到平衡，由平衡又到新的不平衡，从而把生产运动从一个高潮推向另一个新高潮。
    大面积平衡增产运动是“抓两头、带中间”这一工作方法的具体运用。在这个运动中，各地十分注意抓先进典型，大插红旗，广树标兵，及时总结和推广先进经验。同时，根据历年经验，各地还采取了下放干部、层层包干的办法，加强对落后地区的具体领导。仅石首县最近就抽调了五个县委委员，三百多名干部，组织了四十三个工作组，分别到工作基础较差的生产队加强领导。红安县委书记亲自带领四百多名干部群众，大战四天，把一百多亩土层原来只有四寸深的地加深了一倍，办起了花生丰产岗。
    由于大面积平衡增产运动的开展，湖北省今年的春播生产出现了万马奔腾、一日千里的大好形势，各类作物的播种又快又好。全省早稻插秧已经基本结束，中稻播种也已基本结束，正加强秧田管理。杂粮和经济作物的播种工作，更比历史上任何一年都抓得好。全省八百多万亩棉花已种完。
    本报讯　陕西省山区和高塬丘陵地区，大力革新农业技术，提高春播质量，决心变低产区、低产田为高产区、高产田，实现农业生产上的全面均衡增产。
    陕南秦岭、巴山山区和陕北高塬丘陵地区春播面积约占全省春播粮食面积的70％以上，但这些地区农作物产量一般较低，因此把这些地区的生产水平提高一步，具有重大的战略意义。目前，山区人民正围绕春播，大力开展耕作技术革新和技术革命运动。各地普遍提出春播要做到“六改”，即改硬茬下种为深翻细整后播种；改白地下种为施底肥播种；改撒种为条播；改混种为良种；改单季作物为套种；改低产作物为高产作物等。为了全面推广农业技术改革，各地都大量培训了农业技术员和土专家。秦岭山区的商南、商县都培训了大批薯类技术员，镇安培训了玉米技术员，榆林专区还召开全区的洋芋增产现场会议，传播洋芋增产经验。截至5月6日，山区和高塬地区春播已完成八百二十一万多亩。这些地区今年普遍深翻土地，一般都深翻六寸左右，实行精细整地，消灭了硬茬播种；普遍施足底肥，一般高山地每亩施底肥三千斤左右，丰产田每亩施底肥一万到一万五千斤左右，彻底消灭了白籽下种。今年山区和高塬丘陵地区良种约占90％左右。各地还大量扩大了高产作物面积，其中仅薯类就比去年扩大了一倍以上。在播种方法上也普遍地改撒播为条播，比往年增加了播种量20％左右，做到合理密植。
    各地在改革农业技术中，创造了很多适用于山区、高塬的新工具。镇安县群众为了适应坡地运输，创造了便于爬坡的前轮小后轮大的土火车，可以运送肥料和庄稼；还有浇地均匀、避免冲刷泥土的人工降雨器。这种降雨器只用一人操作，一天可浇坡地四亩。秦岭山区各县为了解决高山地区的施肥问题，普遍就地建立土化肥厂，熏肥坑，沤肥池等，来解决运输肥料的困难。陕北高塬也普遍采用就地造肥和把猪圈、羊圈搬上山等方法解决肥料问题。
    目前，一个声势浩大的高山赶浅山、山区赶平川的丰产运动，已经在山区和高塬地区形成。山区、高塬丘陵地区各公社都普遍建立了各种丰产田。建安专区各县已经建立了二百十一万多亩丰产田。各级党委都加强了对丰产田的领导，各类丰产田都有专人负责管理，并分别建立了档案制度。
