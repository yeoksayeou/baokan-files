Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 30th -- A vigorous summer harvest and planting upsurge is sweeping across Hunan Province, greatly accelerating the progress of the summer harvest and planting. The harvesting of spring-harvested crops such as rapeseed and wheat began in full swing in early May. As of now, more than seven million mu have been harvested. The planned spring and summer grain sowing tasks have been overfulfilled, with the area sown increasing by 3.2 times compared to the same period last year.

This year, Hunan Province has achieved a general bumper harvest of wheat, breaking the conservative thinking of some people who believed that "Hunan is not suitable for growing wheat, and even if it is grown, it cannot produce high yields." Since last winter, Party organizations at all levels in Hunan Province, in accordance with the principle of "combining the expansion of cultivated land area with increasing unit area yield," mobilized the vast number of cadres and the masses to seize the time and expand the planting of spring-harvested crops by more than 10 million mu. After sowing, various localities strengthened cultivation and management, and continuously overcame various natural disasters, thus achieving a bumper harvest. From the foot of the Five Ridges Mountains to the shores of Dongting Lake, from the plains to the high and cold mountainous areas, bumper yield plots and bumper yield hills emerged everywhere, with yields surpassing any previous year.

Before the rush harvest, all localities arranged labor organization, put forward quality requirements, and prepared the rush harvest tools. During the rush harvest, various localities adopted the "one-dragon" continuous operation method of cutting, transporting, drying, threshing, and storing, so as to achieve immediate cutting, transporting, drying, threshing, and storing. In order to overcome the overcast and rainy weather, various localities also adopted methods such as sun-drying, air-drying, wind-drying (using windmills to dry water vapor), and baking (setting up baking stoves to dry with fire), so that the harvested grain would not suffer any losses.

While vigorously rushing to harvest, various localities carried out the summer planting work centered on rushing to plant sweet potatoes, corn, and sorghum.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 30th -- Wheat in Anhui Province has matured successively from south to north. Now, everywhere is a golden scene of wheat waves rolling. Wheat harvesting has generally started on both banks of the Yangtze River. By the 26th, more than 400,000 mu had been harvested.

The characteristics of this year's bumper wheat harvest in Anhui Province are: large bumper yield plots, large ears, and heavy grains. In the Huaibei Plain, where the most wheat is planted, the wheat growth is generally better than last year. Wheat in many low-lying and poor lands is also growing tall and with large ears. For example, in Jilunzhai Commune in Guoyang County, where alkaline land and sandy loam soil account for half of the cultivated land, the wheat is growing particularly well this year. Old commune member Ji Shouchu said: "I am over sixty years old, and I have never seen such a spectacular wheat field. The wheat stalks are four feet deep, and one mu can yield several hundred jin." The Youth Team of Chengjiao Commune in Yingshang County, which achieved a large-scale bumper wheat harvest last year, is growing very well this year. Not only has the wheat area along both banks of the Yangtze River expanded a lot this year, but it is also generally growing well. The wheat planted on the newly reclaimed more than 200,000 mu of land in Wangjiang County has now become a boundless sea of wheat. The commune members praised: "The people's commune has great power, and good crops grow on the lake beach. Although the wheat was good last year, it is still worse than this year."

This year, the area of high-yield wheat fields in the province accounts for 40% of the total wheat area. The wheat in the high-yield fields is growing particularly well. The broad masses of commune members say, "High-yield plots are easy to manage, the area is large, and the wheat is even." The high-yield wheat plots in Shucheng County are large plots covering small plots, one plot connecting to another, accounting for 60% of the total wheat planting area. The red flag of wheat high yield in the province -- Paidong Commune in Liu'an County, had only 2,900 mu of large-scale high-yield fields last year, but this year it has expanded to 34,800 mu.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 29th -- Rapeseed harvesting is reaching a climax in various parts of Jiangsu. By the 27th, 1.2 million mu of rapeseed had been harvested throughout the province. The early-maturing local rapeseed has all been harvested.

Due to the conscientious implementation of the policy of taking grain as the key link and making comprehensive arrangements, the rapeseed harvesting area in Jiangsu Province this year has more than doubled compared to last year. The rapeseed planted by various localities using gaps such as the sides of houses, riverbanks, and roadsides has also yielded good harvests. At the time of sowing, various localities grasped the season, achieved deep plowing, close planting, and sufficient base fertilizer application. After sowing, they also continuously took measures such as topdressing, preventing waterlogging, preventing frost, and earthing up and weeding, and the rapeseed grew generally well.

In order to ensure a high yield and a bumper harvest, various localities organized labor to rush to harvest when the rapeseed was close to "90% maturity." The rapeseed in Jiangdu County began to be harvested on May 9th, and it was all harvested in only nine days. While harvesting, this county also arranged for more than 3,000 commune members to rush to thresh and sun-dry, so as to achieve simultaneous harvesting and threshing. Lianshui County, which harvested rapeseed on a large scale for the first time this year, used mat underlays when harvesting, and wrapped the rapeseed in bed sheets when transporting to avoid scattering the rapeseed, so as to achieve "a clean place after harvest, a clean road after transportation, a clean threshing ground, and a clean rapeseed stalk."

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 29th -- The suburbs of Shanghai, a famous high-yield rapeseed area, have begun to enter the busy rapeseed harvesting season.

This year, the rapeseed in the suburbs is generally growing with strong plants, many branches, thick pods, and heavy grains. On the east bank of the Huangpu River, a golden, dense rapeseed field stretches as far as the eye can see. Old people praised: such good rapeseed has never been seen before. In order to avoid the rapeseed pods from splitting and shedding grains, people get up early to harvest before the dew dries.

The rapeseed planting area in the suburbs of Shanghai this year is much larger than last year, and it is the most planted year in history. In addition to taking appropriate measures such as advancing the sowing period and strengthening field management to strive for a bumper rapeseed harvest, the people in the suburbs have also vigorously overcome various natural disasters. Commune members said: "This year the wind is not favorable and the rain is not smooth, and the rapeseed harvest depends on hard work."

The counties in the suburbs of Shanghai have made thorough preparations for tools, sites, and labor before the harvest. Many communes also organized cadres and experienced farmers to go deep into the fields to "step on the field, look at the green maturity, and set the time" to achieve harvesting one plot at a time. Because rapeseed pods are easy to dry and crack, losses are easily caused during harvesting and transportation. Commune members of Xinhang Commune in Nanhui County took out more than 1,000 bed sheets to wrap the rapeseed during harvesting. In order to support the communes in rushing to harvest and thresh rapeseed, the workers of the Pudong County Agricultural Machinery Factory worked hard for a week to rush to produce more than 50 all-purpose threshers. This machine not only increases the threshing efficiency by more than ten times compared to manual work, but also avoids losses due to incomplete manual threshing.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 29th -- Xupu County, Hunan, one of the nationally renowned high-yield rapeseed areas, has once again achieved an unprecedented large-scale bumper harvest of rapeseed this year. Whether it is an old producing area or a new producing area, whether it is a plain, a hilly area, or a high and cold mountainous area, high-yield good news has been reported. By May 25, more than 90,000 mu of rapeseed had been harvested throughout the county, some of which had been cleaned, dried, weighed, accepted, and stored. The average yield per mu increased by nearly 50% compared to 1959. Xupu County achieved a large-scale balanced increase in rapeseed production this year, which is the result of giving full play to the heroic spirit of "man will conquer nature" and overcoming several natural disasters and pests and diseases. In the later stage of rapeseed growth alone, the county launched three campaigns to prevent and eliminate diseases.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 27th -- Yichun County, Jiangxi Province, has achieved an extraordinarily large harvest of rapeseed. A contiguous high-yield field of 20,000 mu harvested a total of 3.15 million jin of rapeseed, of which 17,000 mu yielded 150 jin per mu, and 3,000 mu yielded 200 jin per mu.

These rapeseed in Yichun County, which achieved a bumper harvest, were all planted using paddy fields. It has made a meaningful experiment for promoting the three-crop-a-year cultivation system of early rice, late rice, and rapeseed in several southern provinces.

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 29th -- Qianxi County, located in the high and cold mountainous area of Guizhou, has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of rapeseed this year. The yield of many fields has increased by about two times compared to last year.

This year, the county's rapeseed land has increased by more than four times compared to 1958. In order to ensure high yield and multiple harvests under multiple planting conditions, leading cadres at the county, commune, and team levels have all conducted experimental fields in high-yield dams. After gaining experience in experimental fields and high-yield dams, they immediately promoted it to general fields, thereby ensuring the healthy growth of rapeseed throughout the county, with many pods and full seeds.

    千里沃野小麦油菜喜丰收
    湖南小麦产量胜过往年　安徽沿江两岸小麦普遍收割
    江苏和上海市郊抢收油菜进入高潮　溆浦、宜春、黔西油菜空前丰收
    据新华社长沙30日电　湖南省各地掀起轰轰烈烈的夏收夏种高潮，大大加快了夏收夏种的进度，全省油菜、麦子等春收作物收获工作，从5月上旬起全面开始收割，到目前已收割了七百多万亩；原计划播种的春夏粮任务已超额完成，面积比去年同期播种增加三点二倍。
    今年湖南省小麦普遍丰收，打破了某些人认为“湖南不宜种小麦，种了也不能高产”的保守思想。从去冬以来，湖南省各级党组织根据“扩大耕地面积与提高单位面积产量相结合”的方针，发动广大干部群众抢时间，扩种了春收作物一千多万亩。播种以后，各地又加强了培育管理，不断地战胜各种自然灾害，因而取得丰收。从五岭山下到洞庭湖滨，从平原到高寒山区，丰产片和丰产丘到处涌现，产量胜过以往任何一年。
    各地在抢收前都安排好劳动组织，提出质量要求，并作好抢收工具的准备工作。在抢收中，各地采取割、运、晒、打、藏“一条龙”流水作业方法，作到随割、随运、随晒、随打、随藏。为了战胜阴雨，各地还采取晒（干）、晾（干）、风（风车车干水气）、烘（设立烘灶，用火烘干）等办法，使收回的粮食，颗粒不受损失。
    在大力抢收的同时，各地开展了抢栽红薯、种包谷、高粱为中心的夏种工作。
    新华社合肥30日电　安徽省的小麦已从南到北相继成熟。现在到处是麦浪翻滚，一片金黄。沿长江两岸的小麦普遍开镰收割，到26日，已割下四十多万亩。
    安徽省今年小麦丰收的特点是：丰产片大，穗子大，粒子重。种植小麦最多的淮北平原，麦子长势普遍赛过去年，很多洼地、孬地的小麦也长得秆高穗大。如碱地、砂矼土就占耕地一半的涡阳县纪伦寨公社，今年小麦长得特别好，老社员纪守初说：“我老汉今年六十多，像这样排场的小麦还未见过，麦棵足有四尺深，一亩能打几百斤。”去年获得小麦大面积丰收的颍上县城郊公社青年队，今年种植的小麦都长得很出色。沿长江两岸今年不但小麦面积扩大了很多，而且也普遍长得好。望江县在新垦的二十多万亩地上种的小麦，现在变成一望无际的麦海，社员们歌颂道：“人民公社力量大，湖滩长出好庄稼，去年麦子虽然好，比起今年还算差。”
    今年全省小麦丰产田的面积占小麦总面积的40％。丰产田的麦子长得特别好，广大社员都说“丰产片，爱坏人，面积大，麦子匀”。舒城县小麦丰产片是大片套小片，一片连一片，占小麦种植总面积的60％。全省小麦丰产的红旗——六安县渒东公社，去年小麦大面积丰产田只有二千九百亩，今年已扩大到三万四千八百亩。
    新华社南京29日电　江苏各地抢收油菜进入高潮。到27日，全省丰收登场的油菜已有一百二十万亩。成熟较早的本地油菜已全部收割结束。
    江苏省由于认真贯彻以粮为纲全面安排的方针，今年的油菜收获面积比去年扩大一倍多。各地利用屋边、河边、路边等隙地种的油菜收成也都较好。在播种时，各地抓住了季节，做到了深耕、密植、施足基肥，播种后，又连续采取了追肥、防涝、防冻和壅根除草等措施，油菜长势普遍良好。
    为了保证丰产丰收，各地在油菜接近“九成熟”的时候，就组织了劳力抢收。江都县的油菜从5月9日开始收割，只九天时间就全部割完。这个县在收割的同时，又安排了三千多个社员突击脱粒和曝晒，做到了边收割、边脱粒。今年首次大面积收获油菜的涟水县，社员们在收割时用?子垫底，运输时用被单包、避免菜籽抛撒，做到了“收后地方净、运后路上净、打后场面净、油菜秸上净”。
    据新华社上海29日电　著名的油菜高产区上海市郊，已开始进入繁忙的油菜收获季节。
    今年市郊的油菜普遍长得株壮枝多，荚粗粒重，黄浦江东岸一片金黄茂密的油菜一望无际，老年人称赞道：这样好的油菜，过去从未见过。为了避免油菜裂荚落粒，人们都趁着露水未干前就起身收割。
    上海市郊今年油菜种植面积比去年扩大很多，是历史上种植最多的一年。市郊人民除了采取适当提早播种期，加强田间管理等措施争取油菜丰产外，还大力战胜了各种自然灾害。社员们说：“今年风不调、雨不顺，油菜丰收靠干劲。”
    上海市郊各县在收割前进行了周密的工具、场地、劳动力的准备。许多公社还组织干部和老农深入田间，“踏田头，看青熟，定时间”，做到熟一块，收一块。由于油菜荚容易燥裂，在收割、运输过程中容易造成损失。南汇县新港公社社员们在油菜收割时，拿出一千多条被单把油菜包起来。浦东县农具厂为了支援公社抢割脱粒油菜，工人们苦战一星期，赶制出五十多架万能脱粒机。这种机器不仅脱粒效率比人工提高十倍以上，还可避免因手工脱粒不净的损失。
    据新华社长沙29日电　全国闻名的油菜高产地区之一——湖南溆浦县，今年又获得了油菜空前未有的大面积丰收，不论是老产区，还是新产区，也不论是平原、丘陵，还是高寒山区，都传来了高产捷报。到5月25日，全县已收的九万多亩油菜，其中一部分经打净晒干，过秤验收入仓，每亩平均单产比1959年增加了近五成。溆浦县获得今年油菜大面积平衡增产，是发挥“人定胜天”的英雄气概，战胜了几次自然灾害和病虫害的结果。仅在油菜生长后期，全县就开展了三次防病灭病运动。
    据新华社南昌27日电　江西省宜春县油菜特大丰收。两万亩连片高额丰产田共收菜籽三百一十五万斤，其中一万七千亩亩产一百五十斤，三千亩亩产二百斤。
  宜春县获得大丰收的这些油菜，全都是利用稻田种植的。它为在南方几省推行早稻、晚稻、油菜一年三熟的耕作制度，作了有意义的试验。
    据新华社贵州29日电　地处贵州高寒山区的黔西县，今年油菜获得空前大丰收。许多田的产量比去年都增产了两倍左右。
    今年全县的油菜地比1958年增加了四倍多。为了保证在多种的情况下高产多收，县、社、队的各级领导干部，都在丰产坝里搞试验田，在试验田、丰产坝里取得经验后，立即推广到一般田，从而保证了全县油菜健壮成长，荚多籽饱。
