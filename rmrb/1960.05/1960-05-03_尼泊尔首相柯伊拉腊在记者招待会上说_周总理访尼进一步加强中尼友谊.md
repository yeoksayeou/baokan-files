Xinhua News Agency, Kathmandu, 30th April. Nepalese Prime Minister Koirala said at a press conference today that the Chinese Premier's visit has further strengthened the friendship between the two countries, and a treaty of peace and friendship has been signed. The differences on the border issue have been narrowed down to a very small extent.

Prime Minister Koirala announced that the high-level joint committee on the border issue between Nepal and China will be established within a week or ten days to deal with the border issue. Koirala also announced that the Chinese Embassy will be established here in June or July.

Many American and Indian journalists asked about the Mount Everest issue. Koirala said that during the talks between the two Premiers, the differences had been narrowed down to the minimum. He added, "We believe that many differences have been eliminated. We are studying the actual geographical location, and after studying it, I will write to Premier Zhou Enlai."

Prime Minister Koirala pointed out that China accepted Nepal's map of that part of Mount Everest in a spirit of friendship and respect. He said that his talks with the Chinese Premier were very friendly.

Koirala said that in the past, passports for expeditions to Mount Everest from the south were issued by the Nepalese government, and passports from the north were issued by the Chinese government within Tibet, and this is still continuing.

He denied that Nepal had rejected China's proposal to sign a non-aggression treaty. He said that this was not the case, China had not made such a proposal, and therefore there was no question of Nepal refusing.

Prime Minister Koirala mainly talked about the so-called Mount Everest issue at today's press conference, and the questions raised by American and Indian journalists also focused on this issue.

Koirala said that according to the map Nepal gave to China, the southern part of Mount Everest belongs to Nepal. He said that most of the northern part is actually within China's location, and the north slope of the mountain up to 17,000 feet where Rongbuk Monastery is located is under China's actual administrative control, and Nepal has never made any claims on Rongbuk. The current issue is the geographical location and the percentage of control of this mountain. He said that the Nepalese map did not show the geographical location, and in the past, the north was under the actual jurisdiction of China through the Tibetan government. The Tibetan government has always issued permits to explorers starting from the north, "We will maintain this state."

He said that the current difficulty is, if the north slope belongs to China and the south slope belongs to Nepal, then where will the summit be located, and who will give the permits to the expedition members. But he reiterated that Nepal agrees to the fact that China governs the north slope, and the difference is only a few yards of this mountain. He said that it takes time to study its geographical location.

He revealed that Chairman Mao Zedong suggested that Mount Everest could be renamed Sino-Nepalese Friendship Peak.

He said that the entire disputed area on the border between the two countries only involves one hundred square miles. He said that he has noted the statement made by the Chinese Premier at the press conference regarding China's attitude towards the resolution of these areas. He believes that this is a very friendly statement.

American journalists representing the American "Life" Weekly and "Time" Weekly asked the question that since China is "bargaining," will Nepal continue to "bargain" with China. Koirala said that in view of the new changes, this is not a question of bargaining. A "Life" Weekly journalist also said that now Nepal cannot say that Mount Everest belongs to Nepal. Koirala gave a negative answer. He said: No. But he said that since the atmosphere has become friendly, it will not be difficult to solve this problem.

Many Nepalese journalists were interested in the Chinese Premier's talk about establishing direct transportation links between the two countries, and they asked how possible it was. Koirala said that if this is economically necessary, Nepal will definitely consider this issue. But there is no such proposal yet.

He believes that due to the friendly relations between the two countries, the border committee will not have major difficulties in resolving the border issue.

Regarding the implementation of aid agreements, Koirala said that Nepal is formulating various plans, such as irrigation, hydropower, and agricultural development. Chinese experts here will conduct surveys for the construction of a cement plant, and Nepalese personnel will soon be sent to China for training.

    尼泊尔首相柯伊拉腊在记者招待会上说
    周总理访尼进一步加强中尼友谊
    会谈是非常友好的。两国签订了和平友好条约。关于边界问题的高级联合委员会即将成立。尼泊尔同意这一事实，中国管辖着珠穆朗玛峰的北坡，分歧只不过是山峰的几码地方，现在正在研究实际的地理位置。
    新华社加德满都30日电　尼泊尔首相柯伊拉腊今天在记者招待会上说，中国总理的访问，进一步加强了两国的友谊，而且签订了和平友好条约，关于边界问题的分歧已经缩小到很小的程度了。
    柯伊拉腊首相宣布，尼中两国关于边界问题的高级联合委员会将在一星期或十天之内成立，来处理边界问题。柯伊拉腊还宣布，中国大使馆将在6月或7月在这里成立。
    许多美国和印度记者问起珠穆朗玛峰的问题。柯伊拉腊说，在两国总理举行会谈时，分歧已经缩小到最小的程度。他又说，“我们认为，许多分歧已经消除了。我们正在研究实际的地理位置，在经过研究以后，我将给周恩来总理写信。”
    柯伊拉腊首相指出，中国本着友好和尊重的精神接受尼泊尔关于珠穆朗玛峰那部分的地图。他说，他同中国总理的会谈是非常友好的。
    柯伊拉腊说，在过去，从南方去珠穆朗玛峰的探险队的护照是由尼泊尔政府发给的，从北方去的护照是由西藏境内的中国政府发给的，即便现在还是继续这样做。
    他否认尼泊尔拒绝了同中国签订互不侵犯条约的建议。他说，情况并不如此，中国并没有提出这种建议，因此，也没有发生尼泊尔拒绝的问题。
    柯伊拉腊首相今天在记者招待会上主要谈到所谓的埃佛勒斯峰（即珠穆朗玛峰）问题，而美国和印度记者所提出的问题也集中在这个问题上。
    柯伊拉腊说，根据尼泊尔交给中国的地图，珠穆朗玛峰的南部属于尼泊尔。他说，北部的大部分实际上是在中国的位置内，这个山峰北坡直到绒布寺所在的一万七千英尺处是处在中国的实际行政控制下，而且尼泊尔从来没有对绒布提出要求，现在的问题是地理位置和控制这个山峰的百分比问题。他说，尼泊尔的地图并没有表明地理位置，在过去，北方是通过西藏政府处在中国的实际管辖之下的。西藏政府一向对从北方出发的探险人员签发许可证，“我们将保持这种状态。”
    他说，目前的困难是，如果北坡是属于中国的，南坡是属于尼泊尔的，那么顶峰的位置将在什么地方呢，谁来给远征人员的许可证呢。但是他重申，尼泊尔同意这一事实，中国管辖着北坡，分歧只不过是这个山峰的几码地方。他说，研究它的地理位置是需要时间的。
    他透露，毛泽东主席建议珠穆朗玛峰可以改名为尼中友好峰。
    他说，两国边界上整个争议地区只牵涉到一百平方英里。他说，他已经注意到中国总理在记者招待会上有关中国对这些地区的解决的态度的说法。他认为，这是很友好的说法。
    代表美国“生活”周刊和“时代”周刊的美国记者提出了这样的问题，既然中国是在“讨价还价”，尼泊尔是否将继续同中国“讨价还价”。柯伊拉腊说，鉴于新的变化，这不是讨价还价的问题。“生活”周刊记者还说，现在尼泊尔不能说埃佛勒斯峰是属于尼泊尔的了。柯伊拉腊作了否定的答复。他说：不。但是他说，由于气氛变得友好，解决这个问题是不会有困难了。
    许多尼泊尔记者对中国总理所说的应在两国之间建立直接的交通连系的谈话感到兴趣，他们问可能性如何。柯伊拉腊说，如果这在经济上是必要的，尼泊尔一定会考虑这个问题。但是现在还没有这种建议。
    他认为由于两国之间的友好关系，边界委员会在解决边界问题时不会有重大的困难。
    关于执行援助协定的问题，柯伊拉腊说，尼泊尔正在制定各种计划，如灌溉、水力发电和农业发展，这里的中国专家将为建造一个水泥厂进行勘测，尼泊尔的人员不久将派到中国去接受训练。
