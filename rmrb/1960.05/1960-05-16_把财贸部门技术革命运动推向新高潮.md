    Push the Technical Revolution Movement in Finance and Trade Departments to a New High Tide

    The finance and trade departments occupy an important position in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. The finance and trade departments have large business organizations and more than eight million employees, serving both production and the people's lives. Whether it is procurement, processing, transportation, warehousing, sales, tallying, statistics, accounting, or various aspects of life services, there are many time-consuming and laborious manual operations, and thus there is great potential for carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution. The facts of the past few months have proven that once the masses are mobilized to carry out a large-scale technical revolution movement in various industries and departments of the finance and trade system, labor efficiency will be multiplied, and the work of finance and trade will immediately take on a new look. Now, finance and trade departments across the country have selected their representatives, bringing rich and colorful technical revolution achievements, to participate in the National Finance and Trade Department Technical Innovation and Technical Revolution Operation Performance Conference, and through on-site operation performances, to exchange and summarize experiences. There is no doubt that this conference will further encourage the revolutionary spirit of the vast number of finance and trade workers and push the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the finance and trade departments to a new high tide.

    In the current situation where the technical revolution movement in the finance and trade departments is blossoming everywhere, how can we better consolidate and promote the achievements of the technical revolution and timely exert its effectiveness? The basic point is to summarize, identify, grasp the key points, and actively and quickly finalize and promote those innovative projects that can save a large amount of labor, raw materials, and fuel, are the simplest to manufacture, use the least materials, have the lowest costs, and are the easiest to promote. The key points mentioned here are divided into two aspects. On the one hand, there are the key innovations of the finance and trade departments themselves. For example, the finance and trade departments often keep hundreds of billions of yuan worth of goods, and hundreds of millions of tons of goods enter and leave warehouses every year. A large amount of labor is occupied in the links of handling, loading and unloading, stacking, and packaging. The processing departments are also departments with a large proportion of heavy physical labor and occupy the most labor. Quickly implementing mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation in these departments and links, and making them complete sets, can rapidly improve labor efficiency and save a lot of labor, so that the circulation and distribution work can better adapt to the objective situation of the overall leap forward in the national economy. On the other hand, since the finance and trade departments must participate in production and organize production, and also organize and guide the people's economic life, they must actively participate in and support the technical innovation and technical revolution movement of the production departments and other departments. The technical revolution movement in the finance and trade departments should not only focus on saving manpower and material resources in their own departments, but also on saving manpower and material resources for the entire society. For example, the promotion of cooking utensil reform, mechanization of washing and making shoe soles, and reform of pig-raising tools, which are vigorously promoted throughout the country, should be actively participated in and supported by the finance and trade departments. Although these technical innovation and technical revolution achievements may not all be reflected in the finance and trade departments, but in other aspects of society, this is a great good thing for the whole society, and the finance and trade departments should greatly promote the better implementation of these good things. At the same time, if the labor force is saved in society and production is developed, it will promote the continuous leap forward of finance and trade work. Therefore, the current technical revolution movement in the finance and trade departments should not only blossom everywhere, but also grasp the key points, and should not only focus on saving manpower and material resources in their own departments, but also on saving manpower and material resources for the entire society. Only in this way can the effect of the technical revolution be maximized, and can the continuous leap forward of the entire national economy be better promoted.

    Finance and trade work is extremely closely related to the economic life of the broad masses of the people. To continuously expand life service businesses and improve service quality, so as to better meet the economic life needs of the broad masses of the people, we must pay attention to gradually realizing mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation in life services and collective welfare undertakings. And in the case of the rural and urban people's communes and the socialization of housework, which is the organization of people's economic life, it is more possible and more necessary to gradually realize mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation. At present, there have been many innovations and creations in service industries such as cooking, washing, sewing, repairing, and photography. These innovations and creations not only improve labor efficiency and service quality, but more importantly, through the technical revolution, the lives of the broad masses of the people have become more convenient, which is also greatly conducive to the development of productive forces. It can be seen that technical innovation and technical revolution are not only important in production and construction departments, but also equally important in life service departments. The idea of ​​regarding the technical innovation and technical revolution of the life service industry as an insignificant trivial matter is incorrect. Vigorously carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution in the life service industry will greatly advance the socialization of housework from the material and technical aspects, will liberate a large amount of labor, and thus promote the improvement of the productive forces of the entire society.

    In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement of the finance and trade departments, we must also pay sufficient attention to improving the skill level of manual operation and developing traditional manual operation skills. Many types of work in the finance and trade system are manual operations. In the long run, most of the manual operations should be gradually mechanized and semi-mechanized. But at the same time, it should also be seen that, at present, manual operation still occupies a very important position in the finance and trade departments. For example, packaging general merchandise is a common and large amount of manual labor, but when comparing the labor efficiency and work quality of packaging the same kind of commodity, there is a big difference between skilled salespeople and unskilled salespeople. If advanced operating techniques are transformed into a common level, then the efficiency and service quality of sales in commercial departments across the country can be greatly improved. Moreover, many types of manual operations are traditional skills accumulated by the vast number of workers from long-term labor, which are rich and colorful and deeply praised by the broad masses of the people. These situations show that in the technical revolution movement, we must not only not neglect the currently necessary manual operations and traditional manual skills because of technical innovation, but on the contrary, we should further improve the skill level of the currently necessary manual operations, and inherit and develop traditional manual skills, so as to better serve the people's economic life.

    The technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the finance and trade departments has achieved great achievements, but the potential of the technical revolution is still very great. The vast number of employees on the finance and trade front should adhere to the spirit of putting politics in command and continuous revolution, vigorously carry out mass movements, further implement the policy of combining foreign and local methods, and implement the principle of self-reliance. On the basis of the achievements already made, they should quickly push the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the finance and trade departments to a new stage of continuous development, continuous consolidation, promotion, and improvement.

### 把财贸部门技术革命运动推向新高潮

    把财贸部门技术革命运动推向新高潮
    财贸部门在技术革新和技术革命运动中，占有重要的地位。财贸部门有很大的业务机构和八百多万职工，既为生产服务，又为人民生活服务。不论是收购、加工、调运、仓储、销售、点票、统计、核算以及生活服务等各行各业各个环节，都有着较多的费时费力的手工操作，因而可以大搞技术革新和技术革命。最近几个月的事实证明，财贸系统的各行各业各部门一经发动群众大搞技术革命运动，那里的劳动效率就有了成倍的提高，财贸工作就立即出现新的面貌。现在，全国各地财贸部门推选出自己的代表，带着丰富多彩的技术革命成果，参加全国财贸部门技术革新和技术革命操作表演大会，并通过实地操作表演，交流和总结经验。毫无疑问，这个大会必将进一步鼓舞广大财贸职工的革命干劲，并把财贸部门的技术革新和技术革命运动推向一个新的高潮。
    在当前财贸部门技术革命运动遍地开花的情况下，怎样才能更好地巩固推广技术革命的成果，并且及时地发挥它的效能呢？基本的一条是，通过总结、鉴定，抓住重点，积极地、尽快地定型推广那些能够大量节约劳动力和原材料、燃料，制造最简便，费料最少，成本最低，又最便于推广的革新项目。这里所说的重点，又分为两个方面，一方面是财贸部门本身的重点革新，例如，财贸部门经常保管着几百亿元的商品，一年有成亿吨的货物进出仓库，在搬运、装卸、码垛、包装等环节上都占用着大量的劳动力，加工部门也是笨重体力劳动比重很大、占用劳动力最多的部门；尽快地在这些部门和环节上实行机械化、半机械化，自动化、半自动化，并使它成龙配套，就可以迅速地提高劳动效率和节约大量劳动力，从而使流通和分配工作能够更好地适应国民经济全面跃进的客观形势。另一方面，由于财贸部门既要参与生产、组织生产，又要组织和指导人民经济生活；因此，还必须积极参与和支持生产部门及其它部门的技术革新和技术革命运动。财贸部门的技术革命运动不仅要从节约本部门的人力物力着眼，而且应当从节约整个社会的人力物力着眼。例如现在在全国大力推行的炊具改革、洗衣和纳鞋底机械化、养猪工具改革等重要的革新，财贸部门都应当积极参与和支持，尽管这些技术革新和技术革命成果不一定都表现在财贸部门，而表现在社会其它方面，但这是对全社会有益的大好事，财贸部门应当大大促进把这些好事办得更好。同时，社会上劳动力节约了，生产发展了，又会推动财贸工作不断跃进。因此，当前财贸部门的技术革命运动，既要遍地开花，又要抓住重点，既要着眼于本部门人力物力的节约，又要着眼于整个社会的人力物力的节约。只有这样，才能最大限度地发挥技术革命的效果，才能更好地推动整个国民经济的持续跃进。
    财贸工作和广大人民群众的经济生活有着极为密切的关系，要不断地扩大生活服务业务，提高服务质量，以便更好地满足广大人民的经济生活需要，就必须注意在生活服务和集体福利事业方面逐步实现机械化、半机械化，自动化、半自动化。而在城乡人民公社化，人民经济生活组织起来实现家务劳动社会化的情况下，逐步实现机械化、半机械化，自动化、半自动化就更有可能和更为必要了。目前在炊事、洗衣、缝纫、修配、照像等服务行业已有了许多革新和创造，这些革新和创造不仅提高了劳动效率和服务质量，更重要的是，通过技术革命，使广大人民生活更加方便了，因而也大大有利于生产力的发展。可见，技术革新和技术革命不仅在生产建设部门是重要的，而且在生活服务部门也是同样重要的。把生活服务行业的技术革新和技术革命，看成是一种微不足道的小事的思想是不正确的。大搞生活服务事业的技术革新和技术革命，将从物质技术方面把家务劳动社会化大大向前推进一步，将解放出大量的劳动力，从而也就促进了全社会生产力的提高。
    在财贸部门技术革新和技术革命运动中，还必须足够地重视提高手工操作熟练程度和发扬传统的手工操作技艺。财贸系统有许多工种是手工操作的。从长远来看，手工操作的大部分都应当逐步地实行机械化、半机械化。但同时也应当看到，在目前，手工操作在财贸部门仍然占有很重要的地位。例如包扎百货，这是普遍的、大量的手工劳动，但是，包扎同样一种商品，从劳动效率和工作质量上来比较，熟练的售货员和不熟练的售货员，就有很大的差别。如果把先进的操作技术变为普遍的水平，那么，全国商业部门售货的效率和服务质量就可大大提高一步，而且许多手工操作的工种又是广大职工从长期劳动中积累起来的传统技艺，丰富多彩，深受广大群众的称赞。这些情况说明，在技术革命运动中，我们不仅不能因为搞了技术革新而忽视目前还必要的手工操作和传统的手工技艺，相反的，应当进一步提高目前还必要的手工操作熟练程度，并且继承和发扬传统的手工技艺，以便更好地为人民经济生活服务。
    财贸部门的技术革新和技术革命运动已经取得了巨大的成就，但是技术革命的潜力仍然是很大的。广大财贸战线职工应当坚持政治挂帅和不断革命的精神，大搞群众运动，进一步贯彻洋土并举的方针和实行自力更生的原则，在已经取得成绩的基础上，迅速地把财贸部门的技术革新和技术革命运动推向一个继续发展和不断巩固、推广、提高的新阶段。
