Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch from Tokyo: According to today's "Akahata" report, the Okinawa Youth League Council recently issued a statement firmly opposing the United States' recruitment of young people on Okinawa Island to serve as American mercenaries. This statement was issued in response to Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi's speech in the Diet. Kishi Nobusuke once said: As in the Philippines, the United States has the right to recruit volunteers in Okinawa.

The Okinawa Youth League Council pointed out in its statement that the United States' continued rule over Okinawa Island based on the San Francisco unilateral treaty is against the will of the Japanese people. We, the Japanese people, will never serve as American mercenaries for aggression in the Far East.

Xinhua News Agency, 17th dispatch from Tokyo: 1,500 students in Okinawa passed a resolution on the 16th condemning the United States as colonialists and demanding academic freedom and the right to participate in political movements. The students' resolution was passed at a rally. It also demanded that students have the right to participate in political organizations demanding the immediate return of Okinawa to Japan; boycott free university journals provided by the U.S. occupation authorities; and ban police and military patrol vehicles from campus.

Xinhua News Agency, 11th dispatch from Naha: The Ryukyu Legislature unanimously passed a resolution on the 10th opposing the U.S. military's transportation of "Mace" missiles into Okinawa. The resolution stated that transporting "Mace" missiles, an offensive weapon, into Okinawa would not only exacerbate tensions in the Far East, but also threaten the safety of the people of Okinawa.

The Ryukyu Legislature decided to send this resolution to the President of the United States and the Speakers of both houses of Congress.

    冲绳岛上燃起反美火焰
    青年立志不当美国雇佣兵
    新华社10日讯　东京消息：据“赤旗报”今天报道，冲绳青年团协议会最近发表一项声明，坚决反对美国在冲绳岛征募青年充当美国雇佣兵。这个声明是针对日本首相岸信介在国会里的讲话发表的。岸信介曾经说：同在菲律宾一样，美国有权在冲绳征募志愿兵。
    冲绳青年团协议会在声明中指出，美国根据旧金山片面和约继续统治冲绳岛，这是违背日本人民意志的。我们日本人民无论如何绝不充当美国侵略远东的雇佣兵。
    新华社17日讯　东京消息：冲绳岛的一千五百名学生16日通过一项决议，谴责美国是殖民主义者，并且要求学术自由和参加政治运动的权利。学生们的决议是在一次集会上通过的。它还要求，学生有权参加要求美国立即把冲绳归还日本的政治性的组织；抵制美国占领当局免费给大学的期刊；校内禁止通行警察和军用巡逻车。
    新华社11日讯　那霸消息：琉球立法院在10日一致通过了关于反对美军把“马斯”式导弹运进冲绳的决议案。这项决议案说，把“马斯”式导弹这种攻击性武器运进冲绳，不仅加剧远东的紧张局势，而且也会威胁冲绳人民的安全。
    琉球立法院决定把这项决议案送给美国总统和国会两院的议长。
