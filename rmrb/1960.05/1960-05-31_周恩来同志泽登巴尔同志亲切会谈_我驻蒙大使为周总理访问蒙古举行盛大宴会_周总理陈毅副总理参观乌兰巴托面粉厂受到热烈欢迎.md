Those attending the banquet included: Tsedenbal, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Mongolia; Sambuu, Chairman of the Presidium of the Great People's Khural of Mongolia; and other Mongolian party and government leaders Tsende, Molomjamts, Dugersuren, Jagvaral, Lhamsuren, Maidar, and Foreign Minister Shagdarjav.
    Vice Premier Chen Yi and all the accompanying Chinese comrades attended the banquet.
    The grand banquet began at 8:00 PM. When Premier Zhou Enlai raised his glass to make a toast at the banquet, the entire venue applauded warmly for a long time. Premier Zhou said: "I would like to take this opportunity to propose a toast: to the consolidation and development of the brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Mongolian people, to the further strengthening of the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, to the victory of the struggle against the imperialist policies of war and aggression, to world peace, to the health of the leading comrades of the Mongolian People's Republic Party and Government headed by Comrade Tsedenbal, and to the health of the envoys of socialist countries to the Mongolian People's Republic and all Mongolian comrades attending the banquet!" After his speech, Premier Zhou went to each table to toast with everyone.
    Those attending the banquet warmly welcomed Chairman Tsedenbal's speech. He said that the friendly visit of Comrade Zhou Enlai, Comrade Chen Yi, and other Chinese comrades to our country, their meeting and cordial conversations with the working people, fully demonstrated that the friendship between the Mongolian and Chinese people is constantly being consolidated and developed.
    He said that the most sincere and friendly talks are being held between the two countries, and these talks are entirely for the purpose of further consolidating and deepening the fraternal friendship and cooperation between our two countries. China will provide new and great assistance to the development of Mongolia's industrial sector, water conservancy, and housing and bridge construction.
    Chairman Tsedenbal spoke of the brilliant construction achievements of the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries. He said that every achievement we have made in economic construction is a heavy blow to the imperialist aggressors and warmongers. Every victory we have achieved on the economic front is an important contribution to strengthening the world's peace-loving forces. The people of our country deeply understand this point and are therefore accelerating the pace of socialist construction in the motherland year by year.
    Chairman Tsedenbal said that Mongolia and China are fraternal neighbors. Our common goals and common ideas unite the people of our two countries like brothers connected by flesh and blood. We are delighted and encouraged by the great achievements of world historical significance made by the fraternal Chinese people under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China headed by Comrade Mao Zedong.
    Chairman Tsedenbal said that our two parties, together with the heroic Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the fraternal Communist Parties of other countries, have waged a resolute struggle to defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism against the important enemies of the international communist movement—revisionism.
    Chairman Tsedenbal said that the imperialist aggressive groups headed by the United States have been attempting to undermine the unity of the socialist camp and weaken its strength in recent years, but all kinds of conspiracies and tricks of the enemies of peace and socialism have suffered shameful bankruptcy. This has been the case in the past and present, and will meet with even more shameful endings and defeats in the future.
    Chairman Tsedenbal concluded by proposing a toast to the health of the leading comrades of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese government headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, and to the continuous new achievements of the people of the socialist camp in the cause of communism and socialist construction.
    Ambassador Xie Fusheng spoke at the beginning of the banquet, warmly welcoming Premier Zhou Enlai, Chairman Tsedenbal, Vice Premier Chen Yi, and all the guests. He said that Premier Zhou Enlai's visit comes at a time when the hardworking and brave Mongolian people are fighting with full confidence to complete the Three-Year Plan ahead of schedule and are continuously making great achievements. The great achievements made by the Mongolian people have greatly encouraged the Chinese people, who regard these achievements as their own and are proud of them.
    He also said that Premier Zhou's second visit to the Mongolian People's Republic, Vice Premier Chen's first visit to the Mongolian People's Republic, the fraternal and cordial talks held with Mongolian party and government leaders, and the results that these talks will achieve will become an important milestone in the development history of friendly cooperation between our two countries, and will make great contributions to further strengthening the friendly cooperation between our two peoples, promoting the socialist constructions of our two countries, consolidating the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and defending the world peace.
    The grand banquet proceeded in an extremely cordial and friendly atmosphere from beginning to end. Hosts and guests repeatedly stood up to toast, wishing the consolidation and development of Sino-Mongolian friendship, congratulating the unity of the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union, and wishing world peace.
    Also attending the banquet were envoys from various countries to the Mongolian People's Republic and prominent figures from all walks of life in the Mongolian People's Republic. A total of more than 400 people attended the banquet.
    Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, May 30th: Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi, accompanied by Chairman Tsedenbal and First Deputy Chairman Molomjamts, visited the Ulaanbaatar Flour Mill this morning.
    After the visit, Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi wrote in the guest book: "We are pleased to see the help of such a modern flour mill equipment from the Soviet Union to the Mongolian People's Republic. Long live the unity of the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union!"
    The workers of the Ulaanbaatar Flour Mill lined the road in front of the factory building to warmly welcome Premier Zhou Enlai. Many welcome slogans were hung on the factory buildings, and the national flags of China and Mongolia were flying.
    Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi ascended to the highest floor of the flour mill, which is sixty meters high, overlooking the scenery of Ulaanbaatar, and visited every workshop of the factory. During the visit, they cordially shook hands and talked with the Mongolian workers and the Soviet technicians working in the factory.
