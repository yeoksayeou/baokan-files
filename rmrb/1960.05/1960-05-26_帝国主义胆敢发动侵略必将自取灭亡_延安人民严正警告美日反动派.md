Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, May 25th: The fascist act of U.S. imperialism in instructing the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke clique to forcibly pass the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty has enraged the people of Yan'an, the old revolutionary base area. In recent days, the people of Yan'an have held meetings to support the Japanese people in carrying their patriotic and just anti-U.S. struggle through to the end.

Those participating in the meetings included veteran Red Army soldiers, veteran Red Guard members, cadres, workers, peasants, students, and residents of Yan'an City who had suffered from the frenzied bombing by Japanese planes.

Shi Haisheng, a veteran Red Guard captain, said at the meeting: "The Japanese people's just struggle has the support of the people of the world and will surely achieve victory." When Japanese planes bombed Yan'an in 1938, Old Man Feng Xin's only daughter was killed. Feng Xin said angrily at the meeting: "Today, when I see innocent and lively children, I remember this blood debt. I hate imperialist wars of aggression and resolutely oppose the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty." Kuang Chuan-sheng, a veteran Red Army soldier who participated in the Battle of Pingxingguan, said: "The scars left by the Japanese fascist bandits are still there, and the hidden pain is hard to eliminate. If anyone dares to invade again, we will wipe them out completely." Huang Mingcheng, a deputy regimental commander of the Eighth Route Army during the Anti-Japanese War, said: "In 1938, Japanese planes bombed Yan'an, but they did not frighten the Chinese people. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, we extinguished the flames of the Japanese invaders and defeated the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries, establishing the People's Republic of China. The Chinese people have stood up. If imperialism dares to ignite the flames of aggression again, we, the people of Yan'an, will crush all enemies who dare to invade our sacred territory, just as we痛击蒋胡匪帮进攻延安 in the past." Mr. Ma Boyuan, a democrat currently recuperating in Yan'an Hospital, immediately wrote a letter of protest after hearing the news that the Kishi Nobusuke clique had forcibly "passed" the new "Security Treaty" in the House of Representatives. It read: "The liberated Chinese people are no longer people who can be bullied by anyone. If the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries launch a war of aggression, it will be like an egg hitting a stone, digging their own graves." Imam Ma Junjie also said at the meeting that he firmly supported the Japanese people in carrying the struggle through to the end and was ready at any time to eliminate the imperialist aggressors.

    帝国主义胆敢发动侵略必将自取灭亡
    延安人民严正警告美日反动派
    据新华社西安25日电　美帝国主义指使日本岸信介集团强行通过日美军事同盟条约的法西斯行径，激怒了革命老根据地延安的人民。这几天以来，延安人民纷纷集会，支持日本人民把反美爱国正义斗争进行到底。
    参加集会的有老红军战士、老赤卫队员、干部、工人、农民、学生和曾经遭受日本飞机疯狂轰炸的延安市居民。
    老赤卫队长史海生在会上说：日本人民的正义斗争有着全世界人民的支持，一定能够取得胜利。1938年日本飞机轰炸延安时，冯心老汉唯一的女儿被炸死了。冯心在会上愤怒地说：“今天我一见到天真活泼的儿童，就记起了这笔血债。我恨透了帝国主义侵略战争，坚决反对日美军事同盟条约。”曾经参加过平型关战役的老红军战士况舩生说：“日本法西斯强盗给我留下的伤疤尚在，隐痛难消，谁敢再来侵略，我们就把他们彻底消灭掉。”抗日战争时期的八路军副团长黄明成说：1938年日本飞机轰炸延安，但是并没有吓倒中国人民，我们在共产党领导下，扑灭了日本侵略者的战火，并且打败了蒋介石反动派，建立了中华人民共和国。中国人民站起来了，如果帝国主义胆敢再燃起侵略战火，我们延安人民将和过去痛击蒋胡匪帮进攻延安一样，粉碎一切敢于侵犯我们神圣国土的敌人。正在延安医院休养的民主人士马伯援老先生，听到岸信介集团在众议院强行“通过”新“安全条约”的消息后，马上写了一份抗议书，上面说：“解放了的中国人民已经不是任人欺侮的人民了，美日反动派如果发动侵略战争，那就是鸡蛋碰石头，自找灭亡。”回民阿訇马俊杰也在会上表示，坚决支持日本人民把斗争进行到底，并随时准备消灭帝国主义侵略者。
