Xinhua News Agency, Xining, May 22nd: Two hundred thousand people from all ethnic groups and all walks of life in Xining City held rallies and demonstrations in different districts on the 21st to firmly support the Soviet government's just stand and angrily condemn the serious crimes of US imperialism in infringing upon Soviet sovereignty and sabotaging the Four-Power Summit Conference. At the same time, they resolutely opposed the Kishi Nobusuke government, a running dog of the United States, for forcibly passing the Japan-US military alliance treaty by force, and fully supported the patriotic and just struggle of the Japanese people.

　　At the central venue—the May 1st Club Square in Xining City—the demonstration ranks stood densely packed. Leading comrades of the Qinghai Provincial and Xining Municipal Party, government, and military, as well as responsible persons of democratic parties and mass organizations, attended this massive demonstration rally.

　　The conference officially began at 3:00 PM. Amidst thunderous applause and slogans, Zhu Xiafu, Secretary of the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee, spoke first. He said: US imperialism should know that today's era is no longer one in which they can arbitrarily run rampant. "Those who commit many unrighteous acts will destroy themselves," this is the inevitable end of all imperialism and all reactionaries. If US imperialism dares to openly launch a war of aggression, they will be completely wiped out by the Soviet people, the Chinese people, the people of socialist countries, and the people of the world.

　　Sangre Jiacuo (Tibetan), a member of the Qinghai Provincial Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, then spoke. He said: US imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the people of the world. It is constantly creating international tensions and threatening the peaceful lives of the people. We must redouble our vigilance, strengthen our struggle, and strive for lasting world peace.

　　Representatives of democratic parties, mass organizations, workers, peasants, students, and urban people's communes also spoke at the conference today.

　　Worker representative and national advanced producer Liu Zhicheng said: The Soviet people and the Chinese people have always been the closest comrades and brothers. The enemy of the Soviet people is our enemy, and provocation against the Soviet Union is provocation against us. We resolutely oppose US imperialist aggression and defend world peace. Peasant representative Wang Jinhu said: All the peasants in Xining City resolutely support the solemn statement of Chairman Khrushchev of the Soviet Council of Ministers and strive for lasting world peace.

　　After the meeting, people from all ethnic groups and all walks of life held a massive demonstration parade.

　　Early in the morning, the streets and alleys of Yinchuan City were filled with people participating in demonstrations and rallies. More than 50,000 Hui and Han workers, peasants, cadres, students, urban residents, militiamen, and PLA soldiers, holding aloft huge banners and cartoon placards denouncing US aggression, poured into the South Gate Square in the city to hold a rally. In the Xincheng industrial and mining area and the people's communes and state farms in the suburbs, more than 30,000 people held demonstrations and rallies simultaneously. Even some elderly Hui people who rarely went out on weekdays participated in the demonstration this time.

　　Responsible persons of the Party, government, and military of the Autonomous Region and Yinchuan City, as well as democratic parties and people's organizations, participated in the conference. Responsible cadres from counties and cities in the Autonomous Region who were attending meetings in Yinchuan City also participated in the conference.

　　Wang Feng, First Secretary of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke first at the meeting.

He said: As long as we unite and fight, we will surely win lasting world peace. If imperialism dares to provoke a new world war, the powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and peace-loving people all over the world will resolutely ensure that imperialism disappears from the face of the earth forever.
