Xinhua News Agency, May 22nd. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China sent a telegram on May 17th congratulating the Communist Party of Indonesia on its 40th anniversary. The full text of the congratulatory telegram is as follows: To the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Indonesia:

On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of Indonesia, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, on behalf of all its members and the Chinese people, extends warm and fraternal congratulations to all members of the Communist Party of Indonesia and the Indonesian working people.

For forty years, the Communist Party of Indonesia has gone through a long, tortuous, and glorious road of struggle. In order to oppose the cruel rule of Dutch colonialism and Indonesia's feudal forces, your party led the 1926 anti-Dutch people's armed revolutionary uprising. After that, your party persisted in underground struggle for twenty years under extremely difficult conditions. After the Japanese fascists occupied Indonesia in 1942, your party actively led the people to oppose the bloody rule of the Japanese fascists, always standing at the forefront of the anti-Japanese struggle. After Japan surrendered, your party united the domestic patriotic and democratic forces, actively participated in the August Revolution of 1945, shattered the dream of Dutch colonialists and imperialism headed by the United States to turn Indonesia back into a colony, and established the Republic of Indonesia. Your party's great achievements in the struggle for national independence, democracy, and progress in Indonesia are indelible.

Recently, under the leadership of the Central Committee headed by Comrade D.N. Aidit, your party has carried out a series of struggles and work to strive for the complete completion of the Indonesian national democratic revolution tasks, namely, to continue to thoroughly eliminate the forces of Dutch imperialism in Indonesia; resolutely oppose the criminal activities of American imperialism that endanger Indonesia's national independence; thoroughly eliminate the remaining forces of armed rebellion groups; resolutely safeguard the people's democratic freedoms; strive to improve the people's livelihood; closely unite with the peasants and other working people to strengthen the worker-peasant alliance; develop and consolidate the national democratic united front; strive to improve the Marxist-Leninist ideological level of party members and the level of awareness of the Indonesian people; resolutely oppose revisionism and chauvinism; further consolidate and develop the solidarity of the international proletariat; and carried out tremendous work and unremitting struggle to defend Asian and world peace. Your party has achieved remarkable achievements in these struggles and work. The history of your party's forty years of heroic struggle proves that your party is the true representative of the national interests and the people's interests of Indonesia, so your party's prestige and influence among the Indonesian people are growing day by day, and it is playing an increasingly important role on the Indonesian political stage.

The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people are very excited about all the achievements made by the Communist Party of Indonesia and the Indonesian people. We firmly believe that under the international situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind, the Communist Party of Indonesia, which is full of fighting spirit and closely linked to the masses, will surely achieve greater victories in the struggle for Indonesia's complete national independence, defending the people's democratic freedoms, opposing imperialism, and safeguarding Asian and world peace, and in the struggle to consolidate and unite the forces of the international communist movement.

    祝在争取完全的民族独立、保卫人民的民主自由、反对帝国主义的斗争中取得更大胜利
    新华社22日讯　中国共产党中央委员会在5月17日打电报祝贺印度尼西亚共产党建党四十周年。贺电全文如下：印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会：
    在印度尼西亚共产党成立四十周年之际，中国共产党中央委员会谨代表全体党员和中国人民，向印度尼西亚共产党全体党员和印度尼西亚劳动人民，致以热烈的兄弟般的祝贺。
    四十年来，印度尼西亚共产党经历了一条漫长的、曲折的和光荣的斗争道路。为了反对荷兰殖民主义和印度尼西亚的封建势力的残酷统治，你们党领导了1926年的反荷的人民武装革命起义。此后，你们党在极端艰苦的条件下，坚持了二十年的地下斗争。1942年日本法西斯占领印度尼西亚以后，你们党又积极地领导人民反对日本法西斯的血腥统治，始终站在反日斗争的最前列。在日本投降以后，你们党团结了国内的爱国民主力量，积极参加了1945年八月革命，粉碎了荷兰殖民主义者和以美国为首的帝国主义重新把印度尼西亚变为殖民地的梦想，建立了印度尼西亚共和国。你们党在印度尼西亚的民族独立、民主、进步的斗争中的伟大功绩是不可磨灭的。
    最近，你们党在以迪·努·艾地同志为首的中央委员会的领导下，为了争取印度尼西亚民族民主革命任务的彻底完成而进行了一系列的斗争和工作，即为继续彻底肃清荷兰帝国主义在印度尼西亚的势力；坚决反对美国帝国主义危害印度尼西亚民族独立的罪恶活动；彻底消灭武装叛乱集团残余力量；坚决维护人民的民主自由；争取改善人民的生活；密切同农民及其他劳动人民的团结以加强工农联盟；发展和巩固民族民主统一战线；努力提高党员的马克思列宁主义思想水平和印度尼西亚人民的觉悟水平；坚决反对修正主义和沙文主义；进一步巩固和发展国际无产阶级的团结；保卫亚洲和世界和平进行了巨大的工作和坚持不懈的斗争。你们党在这些斗争和工作中已取得了显著的成就。你们党四十年来的英勇斗争的历史，证明了你们党是印度尼西亚民族利益和人民利益的真正代表者，从而你们党在印度尼西亚人民中间的威信和影响就日益增长，并且在印度尼西亚的政治舞台上起着越来越重要的作用。
    中国共产党和中国人民对于印度尼西亚共产党和印度尼西亚人民所取得的一切成就感到十分兴奋。我们深信，在东风压倒西风的国际形势下，富有战斗精神和密切联系群众的印度尼西亚共产党，一定会在争取印度尼西亚的完全的民族独立、保卫人民的民主自由、反对帝国主义、维护亚洲和世界和平的斗争中，在巩固和团结国际共产主义运动力量的斗争中获得更大的胜利。
        中国共产党中央委员会
        一九六○年五月十七日
