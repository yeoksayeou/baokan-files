Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 19th: The National Committee of the National Front of Democratic Germany held a rally tonight to welcome Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev.

Participating in the gathering were members and alternate members of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party, members of the Presidium of the Council of Ministers, the Presidium of the People's Chamber, and the National Committee of the National Front, as well as representatives from various democratic parties and mass organizations.

The gathering was presided over by Ulbricht. Prime Minister Grotewohl delivered a welcoming speech, followed by speeches from representatives of various democratic parties and mass organizations. Khrushchev also spoke at the meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 19th: Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev made a speech at the airport upon his arrival in Berlin from Paris on the 19th.

He said that the Paris Four-Power Summit Conference was unable to be held due to the position of the United States government. The United States government carried out aggressive actions against the Soviet Union, making it impossible to discuss the issues scheduled to be studied and resolved at the Paris conference.

Khrushchev said that it seems that some people in the United States who are unwilling to ease international tensions and unwilling to eliminate the threat of a new war have once again gained the upper hand in determining policy.

He continued, "Now the whole world sees how dangerous and reckless a policy the American leaders who follow the militarists and revanchists are pursuing. They have wrecked the conference."

He said that in this situation, time is needed, and the efforts of the people and governments of all countries are needed, so that a summit meeting can be held in six to eight months. The governments of the countries that should be represented at this important meeting must act with wisdom, not with threats and ultimatums. The Soviet government will make every necessary effort to ensure that the meeting can be held and that it produces beneficial results.

Khrushchev said that the Soviet government, together with the governments of other socialist countries, will carefully study the current situation and draw the necessary conclusions. "We do not give up the struggle to ease international tensions; our policy remains one of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. Apart from peaceful coexistence, life has not created a better way to maintain peace, prevent new wars, and prevent new serious disasters for the people of all countries."

He said that the people of socialist countries, all peace-loving and upright people, should not relax their vigilance against the provocative activities of the American warmongers. The people of all countries, all upright people in the world, should redouble and double their efforts to ensure that every government sincerely follows the principle of peaceful coexistence, and any new attempts at provocation must be resolutely repulsed.

Khrushchev emphasized that the US government has wrecked the summit conference in which the people of all countries had placed great hopes. However, the issues that were to be discussed at this conference have by no means lost their significance. Among these issues are the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the resolution of the West Berlin issue on this basis. Considering the current situation, we need to consult with the leaders of the German Democratic Republic. The exchange of views that we will have will be beneficial to the cause of peace in Europe.

    德全国阵线全国委员会
    集会欢迎赫鲁晓夫
    新华社柏林19日电　民主德国全国阵线全国委员会今晚举行集会欢迎苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫。
    参加集会的有德国统一社会党中央政治局委员和候补委员，部长会议主席团、人民议院主席团和全国阵线全国委员会的委员们，以及各民主党派和群众团体的代表。
    集会由乌布利希主持。格罗提渥总理致欢迎词后，各民主党派和群众团体的代表先后发了言。赫鲁晓夫也在会上讲了话。
    新华社柏林19日电　苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫19日从巴黎抵达柏林时，在机场上发表了讲话。
    他说，巴黎四国政府首脑会议由于美国政府的立场而没有能够举行。美国政府对苏联进行了侵略行动，并使得讨论预定在巴黎会议上研究和解决的问题成为不可能。
    赫鲁晓夫说，看来，在美国一些不愿意缓和国际紧张局势、不愿意消除新战争威胁的人又一次在决定政策方面占了上风。
    他接着说，现在全世界都看到，跟军国主义分子和复仇主义分子走的美国领导人正在实行着多么危险和轻率的政策。他们破坏了会议。
    他说，在这种情况下，需要时间，需要各国人民和政府的努力，以便能够在六—八个月后举行最高级会议，必须使应该有代表出席这个重要会议的国家的政府要靠着明智精神，而不是靠威胁和最后通牒行事。为了会议得以举行，为了会议能产生有益的结果，苏联政府将尽一切必要的努力。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联政府将同其他社会主义国家政府一起仔细研究当前局势，并作出必要的结论。我们不放弃争取缓和国际紧张局势的斗争，我们的政策仍然是不同社会制度国家和平共处的政策。除了和平共处而外，生活没有创造出维护和平、防止新战争、不使各国人民遭致新的严重灾难的更好的办法。
    他说，但是，社会主义各国人民、所有爱好和平和正直的人们不应放松对美国黩武主义者的挑衅活动的警惕性。各国人民、世界上所有正直的人们应该加倍地、加两倍地努力，争取使每个政府都真诚地遵循和平共处的原则，而对于任何新的挑衅企图都必须给以坚决的回击。
    赫鲁晓夫强调说，美国政府破坏了各国人民曾寄予很大希望的最高级会议。但是，应该在这次会议上讨论的问题绝没有丧失它们的意义。在这些问题中包括缔结对德和约和在这个基础上解决西柏林问题。考虑到现在形成的局势，我们需要同德意志民主共和国领导人进行商讨。我们之间即将进行的交换意见，将有益于欧洲的和平事业。
