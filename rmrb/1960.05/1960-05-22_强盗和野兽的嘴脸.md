The progressive people of the whole world are mobilized to oppose the most brutal common enemy – the American imperialists. Three million people in Beijing took to the streets, using earth-shaking roars to express their determination to stand with the Soviet people, to stand with all people who oppose imperialist aggression and oppression, to support each other in fighting down the imperialist robbers and opposing the mad American aggressors.

American imperialism and all reactionaries are digging their own graves, heading for self-destruction, acting like a gang of mad robbers committing all kinds of evil wherever they can. The American imperialists’ running dogs in Japan forcing through the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty is just the latest in a countless list of bad deeds.

Robbers are accustomed to using the tricks of either openly robbing or secretly stealing. Where they cannot run rampant and be openly tyrannical, they secretly send airplanes to conduct espionage activities. American imperialism has adopted this method against China and the Soviet Union.

After Comrade Khrushchev exposed all the criminal activities of American planes invading Soviet airspace for espionage and reconnaissance, American President Eisenhower, Vice President Nixon, and Secretary of State Herter simply tore off their masks and said that reconnaissance is the established policy of the United States, that they have committed such crimes in the past, and that they will commit such crimes in the present and future. Their reasoning is: since your situation must be kept secret, I will forcibly uncover it. As the head of a country, to utter such shameless words, only robbers who commit robbery, murder and plunder would have such a face and such logic.

How could the leaders of the self-proclaimed “most civilized and democratic” United States have degenerated to the point of being more unreasonable than robbers? Analyzing it from the perspective of historical development and class, it is actually not surprising. Human society has developed to capitalism, which is already the last stage of the old world. Capitalism has developed to imperialism, which is already a decaying and dying stage. The capitalists and their rulers at this stage are already parasitic, rotten, walking corpses. On the surface, they put on a false appearance of "angels of peace," but in reality, they stubbornly act according to their robber logic. The faces of robbers have no shame to speak of, and the essence of decadent capitalist monopolies makes all imperialists disregard shame. As Lenin said, “Imperialism is also increasingly becoming vile and shameless, exposing themselves as a group of beasts and robbers.” Robbers always want to rob, all capitalist imperialists are birds of a feather, and the largest and strongest American imperialism is the most brutal and savage. In order to maintain their bloody rule and world hegemony, so as to continue their parasitic, debauched, and rotten lives, they will resort to any means. Robbers and beasts are their true colors; civilization, democracy, and peace are just their masks. When the American robbers are caught with evidence and stolen goods, they try every means to cover up and quibble; however, this time is different from the past. After the black hands of American imperialism were caught, they did not deny it, but openly admitted it and were determined to be tyrannical to the end. This further reveals the arrogant and shameless face of a robber, exposing the mad aggressive nature of the imperialists.

This time, the American imperialists' crazy performance is not a sign of their strength, but precisely a sign of their death throes. All progressive people in the world see very clearly that American imperialism is nothing more than a paper tiger that looks strong on the outside but is weak on the inside. The false peace that they peddle can no longer deceive anyone. To deal with the American imperialists' "cold war" policy, we must rise up and wage a resolute struggle. Now, millions of people in Asia, Europe, Africa, and Latin America are marching and demonstrating, to extinguish these imperialist robbers who harm the people and to overthrow the capitalist imperialist system maintained by these robbers; it is to liberate mankind from the decaying capitalist society, and it is to fight for the victory of the people.

When the 800 million and more Chinese and Soviet people and the progressive people of all countries who are struggling, that is, the majority of mankind, unite to drive out the scum of humanity, it shows that the human liberation movement has entered a new stage, the lives of the imperialist robbers and beasts who have done all kinds of evil are not long, and the victory of the world's people is not far away.

    强盗和野兽的嘴脸
    蔡云
    全世界进步的人类都行动起来反对最凶残的共同敌人——美帝国主义者了。北京三百万人走上街去，用震动天地的吼声，表示决心和苏联人民站在一起，和一切反对帝国主义侵略和压迫的人民站在一起，互相支援地为打倒帝国主义强盗、反对疯狂的美国侵略者而斗争。
    美帝国主义和一切反动派，正在自取灭亡，自寻坟墓，像一群疯狂的强盗一样在它能够去的一切地方为非作歹。美帝国主义在日本的走狗，强行通过日美军事同盟条约，就是无数坏事中最新的一件。
    强盗惯用的伎俩不是明抢就是暗窃，在他们无法明目张胆，横行霸道的地方，就偷偷摸摸地派飞机进行间谍活动。对中国、对苏联，美帝国主义就是采取这一手段。
    美国飞机侵入苏联领空进行间谍侦察的全部罪恶活动被赫鲁晓夫同志揭露后，美国总统艾森豪威尔、副总统尼克松和国务卿赫脱，索性拉破面皮，说侦察是美国的既定方针，他们过去犯了这样的罪行，现在和将来还要犯这样的罪行。理由是：你的情况既要保密，我就强行侦破。作为一国的元首，竟说出这样无耻的话，只有打家劫舍、杀人掠货的强盗才有这样的嘴脸，这样的逻辑。
    自称为世界“最文明最民主”的美国的首领们，怎么会堕落到比强盗还不讲理的地步呢？从历史发展和阶级观点来分析，其实并不奇怪。人类社会发展到资本主义，已经是旧世界的最后一个阶段，资本主义发展到帝国主义，已经是腐烂垂死的阶段，这个阶段的资本家及其执政者已经是寄生的腐烂的行尸走肉。他们在表面上摆出一种“和平天使”的假相，实际上却顽固不化地按照他们的强盗逻辑行事。强盗们的嘴脸，本来是没有什么羞耻可言的，腐朽的资本主义垄断的本质，使得一切帝国主义者根本不顾什么羞耻不羞耻。正如列宁所说的：“帝国主义也日益变得卑鄙无耻，暴露出他们是一群野兽和强盗。”强盗们总是要进行抢劫的，所有资本帝国主义都是一路货，而最大最强的美帝国主义则表现得最凶残最野蛮。他们为了保持自己的血腥统治和世界霸权，以便继续其寄生、荒淫、腐烂的生活就无所不用其极，强盗和野兽正是他们的本来面目；什么文明、民主、和平不过是他们的假面具而已。美国强盗在人证赃品都被捉住的时候，便百般掩饰和狡辩；然而这次和往次不同，美帝国主义的强盗黑手被抓住之后，不是抵赖，而是公开承认，要决心横行到底。这就更加显出了一副蛮横无耻的强盗嘴脸，暴露出了帝国主义者疯狂的侵略本性。
    美帝国主义者这一次的疯狂表现，并不是它强大有力的表现，而正是垂死挣扎的表现。世界一切进步的人类都看得很清楚，美帝国主义只不过是外强中干的纸老虎。他们贩卖的那套假和平的货色，更迷惑不了任何人。对付美帝国主义的“冷战”政策，只有起来进行坚决的斗争。现在，亚洲、欧洲、非洲、拉丁美洲千千万万的人游行示威，就是要来扑灭这些为害人群的帝国主义强盗，推翻这些强盗们所维持的资本帝国主义制度；就是为了使人类从腐朽的资本主义社会里挣拔出来，就是为了取得人民的胜利而斗争。
    当八亿以上的中苏人民和世界各国正在斗争的进步人民，即人类的大多数都一致行动起来驱除人群中的败类的时候，这说明人类解放运动已进入新的阶段，做尽坏事的帝国主义强盗和野兽们的寿命已经不长，世界人民的胜利已经不远了。
