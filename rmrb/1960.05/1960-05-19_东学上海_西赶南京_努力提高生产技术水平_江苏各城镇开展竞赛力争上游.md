Jiangsu Towns Launch Competition to Strive for the Top

(Our newspaper, Nanjing, 18th dispatch) A city-wide socialist competition movement initiated by Wuxi, Changzhou, and Suzhou in Jiangsu Province, which calls for “Learning from Shanghai in the East and Catching up with Nanjing in the West,” is sweeping across all industries in various towns throughout the province.

This competition was jointly initiated by the three cities of Wuxi, Changzhou, and Suzhou in mid-April. This is a continuation and new development of the city-wide socialist competition movement of the past two years. As early as the end of 1957, the competition among Wuxi, Changzhou, and Suzhou was in full swing. This year, with the vigorous development and further deepening of the mass technological revolution movement, many medium and small cities throughout the province are eager to try, determined to scale new heights, learn from Shanghai, the city with the highest industrial production level in the country, and vow to compete with Nanjing. Therefore, when the three cities initiated the “Learning from Shanghai in the East and Catching up with Nanjing in the West” competition, it spread like wildfire and was immediately met with enthusiastic responses from cities such as Xuzhou, Nantong, Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, Huaiyin, and Xin Hailian, as well as vast numbers of towns. Under the inspiring slogan of "Let's see who wins the championship for the whole year, and compete for the top in the second quarter," the people of all cities are vigorously increasing production and saving materials centered on steel, iron, and coal; continuing to vigorously attack the "four modernizations"; and fully supporting agriculture around the summer harvest and planting, forming a vigorous and magnificent new high tide of competition.

“Learning from Shanghai with hearts as hard as steel, catching up with Nanjing with wills as firm as iron," workers in some small factories in Suzhou said well: "Don't look down on our small factory, we have the courage of a dragon and the ambition of a tiger. Learning from Shanghai and catching up with Nanjing, the hero still depends on today!" The Changzhou Electronic Instrument Factory chose Shanghai Huguang Scientific Instrument Factory, a national red flag factory, as its competitor, and has now exceeded the competition target of trial-producing two new products per day on average. The mechanical industry workers in Wuxi City proposed to learn "high-precision, cutting-edge, and new" technologies from Shanghai, catch up with Nanjing in doubling production, and strive to make diesel engines, precision grinders, and general machinery among the first-class products in the country within the year.

This competition has added new impetus to the technological revolution movement that is currently developing in depth throughout the province. In order to better learn from Shanghai and catch up with Nanjing, many factories are continuing to vigorously promote the "four modernizations" movement and are combining their existing experience into a complete set and promoting it universally. The Jiangnan Steel Cable Factory in Changzhou fought for forty-eight hours to achieve full mechanization and semi-mechanization, achieving "one factory equals two factories, one person equals seven people," doubling the factory's production, and freeing up two-thirds of the manpower to build new workshops.

Suzhou launched a mass collective revolution movement throughout the city. From a collective revolution by system and by district, from the same industry and the same type of work, it has developed into a collective revolution across districts and industries, organizing communist cooperation on a larger scale. By adopting the "battle of strongholds" in various industries to vigorously attack weak links, a situation has emerged in which seven industries, thirteen types of work, and more than 14,000 people have all been freed from manual labor. Fifty-one factories in the city have achieved one factory equaling one and a half factories, forty-seven factories have achieved one factory equaling two factories, and more than thirty factories have achieved one factory equaling three or more factories. Changzhou City launched a movement to support agriculture with large-scale advances and over-fulfillment, and the city's main products to support agriculture, such as internal combustion engines and agricultural pumps, have been completed ahead of schedule and over-fulfilled.

Amidst the wave of catching up, the workers in Shanghai and Nanjing are also in high spirits. They have opened their communist minds, warmly extended the hand of friendship, and are determined to join hands with cities in Jiangsu Province to leap forward together and scale new heights. The Shanghai Textile Industry Department organized a delegation of more than 30 people, including leading cadres, engineering and technical personnel, and nationally famous fine yarn experts Huang Baomei and Li Sulan, and weaving experts Qian Fendi and Liu Lanying. On the first day of Red May, they specially rushed to Wuxi to deliver experience and offer treasures. They were divided into six groups, delving into various factories to impart and exchange production technology experience in spinning, weaving, silk, and wool, as well as experience in running sub-factories and carrying out comprehensive utilization. They boarded the cars to perform operational technical demonstrations. They also agreed to link up with advanced producers in these factories and help each other. The national model group of the textile industry, the Yi Shijuan group of Shanghai Guomian No. 2 Factory, and the national advanced collective, the Wang Lanying group of Suzhou Sulun Textile Factory, signed a competition contract. Yi Shijuan and Wang Lanying had exchanged experiences at the National Conference of Heroes. This time, when Wang Lanying led the skilled car operator Shi Jinxiu and the doffing skilled worker Zhang Huifen in her group to Shanghai to "learn from experience," Yi Shijuan selflessly introduced her group's management experience, and the group workers gave a live performance, helping Sulun Factory solve two major production key points on the spot. The people of Nanjing are also determined to learn from Shanghai and create miracles together with the fraternal cities of the province, and to join hands to go to Beijing, in the competition wave of helping, learning, and catching up.

At present, this mass competition movement is still developing, and it will cooperate with the "Su North boosts to catch up with Jiangnan, Jiangnan goes to the next level" competition movement that is vigorously developing in the rural areas of Jiangsu, forming two huge revolutionary torrents, to promote and guarantee the achievement of a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1960.

    东学上海　西赶南京　努力提高生产技术水平
    江苏各城镇开展竞赛力争上游
    本报南京18日电　江苏省无锡、常州、苏州三个市倡议“东学上海、西赶南京”的城市社会主义竞赛运动，正席卷全省各个城镇的各行各业。
    这个竞赛是无锡、常州、苏州三个市于4月中旬联合倡议的。这是两年来城市社会主义竞赛运动的继续和新发展。早在1957年年底开始，无锡、常州、苏州三市之间的竞赛就搞得热火朝天。今年来，在全民性的技术革命运动蓬勃开展并进一步向纵深发展的形势下，全省的许多中、小城市更是跃跃欲试，立志要攀高峰，要向全国工业生产水平最高的上海学习，誓与南京比高低。因此，当三个市发起开展
  “东学上海、西赶南京”的竞赛运动的倡议以后，犹如燎原之火，立刻得到徐州、南通、镇江、扬州、淮阴、新海连等市以及广大城镇的热烈响应。各市人民在“全年看谁夺冠军，二季度先来比个高低”的豪迈口号鼓舞下，大搞以钢、铁、煤炭为中心的原材料增产节约；继续猛攻“四化”；围绕夏收夏种全力支援农业，形成了一个龙腾虎跃的气势磅礴的竞赛新高潮。
    “学上海心似钢浇，赶南京志如铁坚”，苏州市一些小厂的工人们说得好：“别看我们厂子小，龙心虎胆志气高，学习上海赶南京，英雄还得看今朝！”常州市电子仪器厂选择了全国红旗厂——上海沪光科学仪器厂作为竞赛对手，现在已超过平均每天试制两个新产品的竞赛指标。无锡市的机械工业职工提出向上海学“高精尖新”，赶南京生产翻番，力争在年内使柴油机、精密磨床、通用机械等跃居全国第一流产品行列。
    这一场竞赛，又为目前正在全省深入发展的技术革命运动增添了新的动力，许多工厂为了更好地学上海、赶南京，一面继续大搞“四化”运动，一面把已有的经验配套成龙，普遍推广。常州市江南钢缆厂奋战四十八小时，就实现了全盘机械化、半机械化，达到“一厂顶二厂，一人顶七人”，全厂生产翻一番，还抽出三分之二的人力建设新车间。
    苏州在全市范围内开展了一个集体闹革命的运动。从按系统按区，同行业同工种集体闹革命发展到跨区跨行业的集体闹革命，在更大的范围内组织了共产主义大协作。采取各行各业“攻坚战”猛攻薄弱环节，全市出现了七个行业、十三个工种，一万四千多人一齐摆脱手工劳动的局面。全市已有五十一个工厂实现一厂顶一厂半，四十七个厂实现一厂顶二厂，三十多厂实现了一厂顶三厂以上。常州市开展了支援农业大提前大超额运动，这个市主要支援农业的产品如内燃机、农业用泵等均已提前和超额完成。
    在一片追赶声中的上海和南京市的工人们，也是情绪振奋，他们敞开了共产主义的胸怀，热情地伸出了友谊之手，决心与江苏省各城市携手跃进共攀高峰。上海纺织工业部门组织了一个三十多人的代表团，包括工厂的领导干部、工程技术人员和全国著名的细纱能手黄宝妹、李素兰，织布能手钱芬娣、刘兰英等在红五月的第一天，特地赶到无锡送经献宝。他们分成六个小组，深入各厂传授和交流纺、织、丝、毛等生产技术经验和大办子厂、大搞综合利用等经验，上车进行操作技术表演。并和这些厂的先进生产者相约挂钩，互相帮助。全国纺织工业模范小组、上海国棉二厂裔式娟小组和全国先进集体、苏州苏纶纺织厂汪兰英小组订立了竞赛合约。裔式娟和汪兰英曾在全国群英会上交流过经验。这次当汪兰英带领小组里的值车能手史金秀和落纱能手张惠芬前往上海“取经”时，裔式娟无私地介绍了小组管理工作经验，小组工人并进行现场表演，当场帮助苏纶厂解决了两个重大的生产关键。南京全市人民在边帮、边学、边赶的竞赛浪潮中，也决心和全省的兄弟城市一道，并肩学上海，共同创奇迹，携手上北京。
    目前，这个全民性的竞赛运动还在继续发展，它将与江苏农村中正在蓬勃开展的“苏北鼓劲赶江南，江南更上一层楼”的竞赛运动相配合，汇成两股巨大的革命洪流，为促进和保证实现1960年更大更好更全面的跃进立下丰功伟绩。
