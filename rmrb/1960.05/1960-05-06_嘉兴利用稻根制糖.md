Jiaxing utilizes rice roots to make sugar.

Taozhuang Commune in Jiaxing County, Zhejiang Province, has successfully utilized rice roots to produce maltose syrup. Every 100 jin of dried rice roots can produce 46.5 jin of maltose syrup. The concentration of the maltose syrup reaches 30 degrees, it has no bitter taste, and the glucose content is more than double that of maltose syrup made from rice bran, equaling 80% of maltose syrup made from broken rice. The wet sugar residue left over from sugar production is sweet and contains starch, making it a good pig feed. The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Agriculture has circulated this experience throughout the province, requesting that all localities trial production and promote it.

Currently, Taozhuang Commune has begun large-scale maltose syrup production from rice roots. The entire commune has organized more than 1,200 people to launch a crash campaign to dig up rice roots and has begun training technicians, preparing to set up maltose syrup processing factories in all production teams throughout the commune.

    嘉兴利用稻根制糖
    浙江省嘉兴县陶庄公社利用稻根制造饴糖成功。每百斤干燥的稻根可制出饴糖四十六斤半。饴糖的浓度达到三十度，没有苦味，葡萄糖含量超过糠制的饴糖二倍，等于碎米制的饴糖的80％。制糖剩下的湿糖渣，带甜味，含有淀粉，是喂猪的好饲料。浙江省农业厅已经把这个经验通报全省，要求各地试制和推广。
    目前陶庄公社已经开始大搞稻根制饴糖，全公社组织了一千二百多人突击掘稻根，并开始培养技术人员，准备在全公社所有生产队办起饴糖加工厂。
