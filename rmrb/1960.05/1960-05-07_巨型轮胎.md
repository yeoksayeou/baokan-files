Giant Tires
The Shanghai Zhengtai Rubber Factory has successfully trial-produced a giant tire. This tire is 2.1 meters in diameter, more than a person tall, and more than three times taller than tires used by ordinary trucks. It is intended for heavy-duty trucks used in construction projects, vehicles with a load capacity of 40 to 60 tons. Now, the factory's workers are working hard to put it into production as early as possible to meet the needs of construction sites.
