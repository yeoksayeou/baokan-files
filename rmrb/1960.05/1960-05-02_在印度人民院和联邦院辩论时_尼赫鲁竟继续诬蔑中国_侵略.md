Xinhua News Agency, May 1st. According to reports from the Indian Information Service, Indian Prime Minister Nehru continued to attack China for "aggression" on April 29 during debates in the Indian Parliament's Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha regarding the joint communiqué of the recent meeting between the Prime Ministers of China and India in New Delhi. He said in the Rajya Sabha, "The whole issue is that they have entered our territory, and therefore, in our view, it constitutes aggression. As to whether I have used the word 'aggression', I don't remember, but the entire gist of the debate is that aggression has occurred, and the aggression should be undone."

Although Premier Zhou Enlai expressed his deep regret at the press conference in Kathmandu on April 28 regarding Nehru's remarks attacking "Chinese government aggression" after the Chinese leaders left India, Nehru still repeated his April 26 accusation of Chinese "aggression." Nehru explained, "I don't know which section or those words he is referring to, and it is difficult for me to explain or comment on this." He expressed his disagreement with Premier Zhou Enlai's assertion at the press conference in New Delhi that neither side should present territorial claims as a precondition. He insisted that Chinese troops had occupied Indian territory. He said, "This inevitably concerns the question of that territory, and it would be strange to say that this is something unrelated to territorial claims." He also attacked China's construction of a highway in the Aksai Chin area of Chinese territory in the western sector of the Sino-Indian border as an "intrusion."

In his speeches to both houses of Parliament, Nehru reiterated his view of the meeting, stating that "although this meeting was of no help in solving the problem," it made both sides more clearly understand each other's thinking. He spoke of India's policy "will be to try to be friendly with China." He opposed abandoning the non-aligned policy, believing that "talk about non-alignment and alignment is also a reflection of the Cold War."

When Nehru spoke in the Rajya Sabha about the differing views of both sides on the jurisdiction of various sections of the border, he agreed that "the facts should be examined more thoroughly." He said, "We have not anticipated in the past and do not anticipate now that this examination of facts will produce some remarkable solution. But we believe that this process must be carried through to the end, and it may be helpful to some small extent."

    在印度人民院和联邦院辩论时
    尼赫鲁竟继续诬蔑中国“侵略”
    新华社1日讯　据印度新闻处报道，印度总理尼赫鲁4月29日在印度国会人民院和联邦院辩论中印两国总理最近在新德里举行的会谈的联合公报时继续攻击中国进行“侵略”。他在联邦院说，“整个问题是，他们进入了我们的领土，因此，根据我们的看法，就是进行了侵略。至于我是否用过‘侵略’这个字眼，我记不得了，但是争论的整个主旨就是，进行了侵略，应当取消侵略。”
    虽然周恩来总理4月28日在加德满都记者招待会上对尼赫鲁在中国领导人离开印度后攻击“中国政府侵略”的言论表示非常痛心，但尼赫鲁仍然重复他在4月26日诬蔑中国“侵略”的说法。尼赫鲁辩解说，“我不知道他所指的是那一段或者那些话，我很难加以解释或就此发表任何意见”。他表示不同意周恩来总理在新德里记者招待会上所说的双方不提出领土要求作为先决条件的主张。他硬说中国部队占领了印度的领土。他说，“这不可避免地是关于那块领土的问题，如果说这是同领土要求无关的某种事情，那会是奇怪的。”他还攻击中国在中印边界西段中国领土阿克塞钦地区修建公路是“侵入”。
    尼赫鲁在两院的讲话中重复说明了他对这次会晤的看法，他认为“这次会晤虽然对于解决问题毫无帮助”，但使双方更加清楚地了解了彼此的想法。他谈到印度的政策“将是设法同中国友好”。他反对放弃不结盟政策，认为“关于不结盟和结盟的谈论也是冷战的反映”。
    尼赫鲁在联邦院谈到双方对边界各段管辖情况的分歧看法时同意“应当更加透彻地审查事实”。他说，“我们过去和现在都没有预料对事实的这种审查会产生某种了不起的解决办法。可是我们认为，必须把这种过程进行到底，应当把这种过程进行到底，它在某种微小的程度上可能有所帮助。”
