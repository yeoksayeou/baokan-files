Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, April 30th. More than 12,000 Tibetan workers on various construction fronts in the Tibet region, together with Han workers, are using outstanding production achievements to greet "May Day."

    The repair group led by Tibetan worker Dawa from the Lhasa Automobile Repair Factory, who attended the National Congress of Heroes, overfulfilled the April task of repairing cars in mid-April. They also used their spare time to collect scrap iron and old materials to make fifty-eight pieces of farm tools to give to Tibetan farmer brothers nearby as a gift for the "May Day" International Labor Day. On the newly cultivated farms along the Yarlung Zangbo River, in the logging yards in the Himalayan mountains, and in the Tumengela Coal Mine in the northern Tibetan grasslands, Tibetan workers have made outstanding production achievements.

    A year ago, most of these Tibetan workers were serfs and slaves who had suffered oppression. After the armed rebellion launched by the upper-class reactionary clique in Tibet was quelled, they quickly became workers building a new Tibet under the leadership and help of the Party and rapidly mastered various production technologies. The Tibetan construction worker team at the Lhasa Construction Engineering Office has increased four and a half times compared to the past, and now more than 1,800 people have initially mastered seventeen construction technologies. Tibetan workers are progressing rapidly with the enthusiastic help of Han workers. Last year, 70% of the Tibetan workers in the Construction Engineering Office won the Leap Forward Award or were rated as advanced producers.

### 用优异生产成绩迎“五一”  西藏藏族工人迅速成长

    用优异生产成绩迎“五一”
    西藏藏族工人迅速成长
    新华社拉萨30日电　西藏地区各个建设战线上的一万二千多名藏族工人，正和汉族工人一起，用优异的生产成绩迎接“五一”。
    曾出席全国群英会的拉萨汽车修配厂藏族工人达娃所领导的修理小组，在4月中旬就超额完成了4月份修理汽车的任务。他们还利用工余时间收集废铁和旧料，制出五十八件农具送给附近的藏族农民兄弟，作为“五一”国际劳动节的礼物。在雅鲁藏布江边新开垦的农场上，在喜马拉雅山区的伐木场上，在藏北草原的土门格拉煤矿里，藏族工人们都作出了优异的生产成绩。
    一年以前，这些藏族工人大部分还是受尽压迫的农奴和奴隶，西藏上层反动集团发动的武装叛乱被平息后，他们在党的领导和帮助下，很快成为建设新西藏的工人，迅速掌握了各种生产技术。拉萨建筑工程处的藏族建筑工人队伍比过去增加了四倍半，现在已经有一千八百多人初步掌握了十七种建筑技术。藏族工人们在汉族工人热情的帮助下，进步很快。去年，建筑工程处有70％的藏族工人获得了跃进奖或被评为先进生产者。
