Xinhua News Agency, 28th: The Chinese People's Liberation Army recently held an all-army health work experience exchange conference to summarize the experiences of the spring patriotic health campaign. The conference called on all officers and soldiers to take immediate action and launch a new upsurge in the summer health campaign.

Participating in this conference were advanced units, model individuals, and health work cadres from across the army. At the meeting, it was unanimously agreed that the spring patriotic health campaign had achieved brilliant results. Many troops, in conjunction with the greening and beautification of their barracks, had fundamentally improved environmental sanitation, making the barracks a good place for training, work, study, and rest. With the in-depth development of the campaign to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene, the vast number of officers and soldiers gradually developed good hygiene habits, and a new trend of "everyone talks about hygiene, everywhere talks about hygiene" emerged.

In the pest eradication and disease elimination campaign, a large number of advanced units in eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene emerged throughout the army. For example, a certain unit stationed on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, which often performs duties and training in areas with overlapping peaks and dense forests, has basically eliminated diseases that endanger the health of the troops due to meticulous and in-depth sanitation work. The entire unit is strong and has maintained excellent training results over the years. The Second Company, guarding a certain island, fundamentally changed environmental sanitation in conjunction with the island's construction, making the island lush with trees, flowers everywhere, and turning sewage into lotus ponds, completely eliminating mosquito and fly breeding conditions. With the in-depth development of the pest eradication and disease elimination campaign, many technological innovations have also emerged in hygiene tools and facilities. For example, officers and soldiers created earth-made running water, foot-operated sealed hand washers, toilet flushers, bamboo spittoons, automatic washing machines, etc., which were simple to make, economical and practical, and were well received by the vast number of officers and soldiers.

After extensive discussion, the meeting adopted the "Three-Year Plan (Draft) for the Entire Army to Eliminate the Four Pests, Promote Hygiene, and Eliminate Diseases," revised the "Main Disease Prevention and Control Program," and put forward this year's goals. It requires all units in the army to achieve no rats, no bedbugs, and the vast majority of units to have no mosquitoes or flies and eliminate mosquito and fly breeding conditions, and to play a exemplary role among the people. In terms of hygiene, it requires all troops to vigorously promote hygiene education, enrich the vast number of officers and soldiers' hygiene knowledge, develop good hygiene habits, and truly achieve cleanliness in five aspects: personal, indoor, environmental, dietary, and toilet. In eliminating diseases, it is necessary to vigorously strengthen prevention and control work, adopt a comprehensive method of eliminating sources of infection and cutting off transmission routes, and gradually eliminate the main diseases that endanger the health of the troops. The meeting issued a proposal calling on the entire army to take immediate action, based on the achievements made in pest eradication and disease elimination in the spring, to take advantage of the situation, fight hard for June, July, and August, and lay a solid foundation for completing future pest eradication and disease elimination tasks.

During the meeting, General Yang Chengwu, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the PLA, Lieutenant General Qiu Huizuo, Minister of the General Logistics Department, and Lieutenant General Rao Zhengxi, Deputy Minister, attended the meeting and gave speeches.

    解放军卫生工作经验交流会议号召全军官兵
    立即掀起夏季卫生运动新高潮
    据新华社28日讯　中国人民解放军最近召开全军卫生工作经验交流会议，总结了春季爱国卫生运动的经验。会议号召全体官兵立即行动起来，掀起一个夏季卫生运动新高潮。
    参加这次会议的有全军卫生工作先进单位、模范人物和卫生工作干部。会上，一致认为春季爱国卫生运动成绩辉煌，不少部队结合营区的绿化、美化，从根本上改善了环境卫生，使营区成为训练、工作、学习和休息的良好场所。随着除四害、讲卫生运动的深入开展，广大官兵逐步养成了良好的卫生习惯，出现了“处处讲卫生，人人讲卫生”的新风尚。
    在除害灭病运动中，全军涌现出大批除四害、讲卫生的先进单位。如驻在云贵高原的某部，经常在峰峦重叠、森林密布的地区执勤、训练，由于卫生工作做得细致、深入，基本上消灭了危害部队健康的疾病，全部队兵强马壮，历年来训练成绩一直保持优良水平。守卫在某海岛的二连，结合海岛建设，从根本上改变了环境卫生，使岛上绿树成荫，鲜花遍地，污水变成了荷花池，彻底消灭了蚊蝇孳生条件。随着除害灭病运动的深入发展，在卫生工具和卫生设施方面，也出现了许多技术革新。如官兵们创制了土自来水、脚踏式密封洗手器、厕所抽水器、竹痰盂、自动洗衣机等，制作简单，经济实用，深受广大官兵欢迎。
    会议经过广泛讨论，通过了“全军除四害、讲卫生、消灭疾病的三规划（草案）”、修订了“主要疾病防治方案”，提出了今年的奋斗目标。要求全军所有单位作到无鼠、无臭虫，绝大多数单位无蚊、无蝇和消灭蚊蝇的孳生条件，并在人民群众中起模范作用。在讲卫生方面，要求各部队大搞卫生宣传教育，丰富广大官兵卫生知识，养成良好的卫生习惯，真正做到个人、室内、环境、饮食、厕所等五个方面的清洁。在消灭疾病中，要大力加强防治工作，采取消灭传染源和切断传染途的综合方法，逐步消灭危害部队健康的主要疾病。会议发出倡议书，号召全军立即行动起来，在春季除害灭病取得成绩的基础上，因势利导，大战6、7、8三个月，为完成今后除害灭病任务打下牢固的基础。
    会议期间，解放军总参谋部副总参谋长杨成武上将、总后勤部部长丘会作中将、副部长饶正锡中将等到会讲了话。
