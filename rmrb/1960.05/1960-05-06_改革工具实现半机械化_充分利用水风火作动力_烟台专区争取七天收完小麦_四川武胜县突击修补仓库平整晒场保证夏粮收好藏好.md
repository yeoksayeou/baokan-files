Reform Tools to Achieve Semi-Mechanization, Fully Utilize Water, Wind, and Fire for Power
Yantai Prefecture Strives to Finish Wheat Harvest in Seven Days
Wusheng County, Sichuan, Rushes to Repair Warehouses and Level Drying Grounds to Ensure a Good Harvest and Storage of Summer Grain

(By our dispatch) Shandong's Yantai Prefecture is focusing on technological innovation and tool matching on the one hand, and on the other, is seizing power – extracting power from nature – with the goal of basically achieving semi-mechanization in wheat harvesting, threshing, and transportation this year. They aim to complete the wheat harvest in seven days and threshing in ten days, doing a good job in the summer harvest and planting.

The more than 6.2 million mu of wheat in this prefecture are currently in the jointing and heading stages, growing better than in any previous year. This year, the wheat acreage has been expanded by nearly one million mu compared to last year, and the area for summer harvest and planting will increase by about 20% compared to last year. Furthermore, large areas of high-yield fields are formed in squares and pieces, all being of the same variety, maturing uniformly. Therefore, this year's summer harvest and planting tasks are heavier than any year, requiring more labor and a tighter schedule.

The Yantai Prefectural Party Committee analyzed these situations and made comprehensive arrangements as early as around the Spring Festival. Currently, the focus of tool reform by agricultural, industrial, and commercial sectors across the region has shifted to the summer harvest and planting aspects. Farm tool machinery manufacturing and repair plants in each county, commune, and team are all linked up and take on overall responsibility; the agricultural, industrial, and commercial sectors are also joining hands to carry out comprehensive collaboration, striving to match advanced tools in each process from harvesting, transportation, and threshing to warehousing, making everything handy. Currently, 240,000 pieces of various advanced machines and tools have been repaired and manufactured, and transportation tools have basically achieved rubber-tireization and ball-bearingization. The 8,000 technicians drawn from various factories have all gone to the countryside with red furnaces, heading to various places to impart technology and assist in production. The entire region requires that by the end of May, more than 100,000 sets (pieces) of various types of harvesters and threshers powered by electricity, manpower, or animals be produced, striving to have more than 50% of the wheat harvested using machinery and semi-mechanized tools, and more than 70% of the wheat threshed using machinery or semi-mechanized tools. After the above plans are realized, the wheat harvesting, transportation, and threshing in the entire region will be basically semi-mechanized, saving approximately 11.8 million labor days, allowing for the completion of wheat harvesting in seven days and threshing in ten days.

In order to better promote the realization of agricultural mechanization and save more labor, Yantai Prefecture is vigorously developing the comprehensive utilization of water, wind, and fire, trying every possible means to solve the power problem. Penglai County has also created a waterwheel that uses manpower, animal power, and wind power, and has established wind-powered waterwheel groups to realize wind-powered transport. Currently, more than 14,000 wind-powered waterwheels have been developed throughout the region. With the development of large-scale water conservancy construction, this prefecture has launched a mass movement of the entire people to build hydropower stations and hydroelectric power stations. Many communes and production teams can make their own indigenous generators. By the end of last month, 249 hydropower stations and 23 hydroelectric power stations had been put into production, which can drive more than 300 various steel mills and stone mills, grinding 350,000 jin of flour daily. They can also be used for crushing feed, sawing wood, lighting, irrigating, etc., saving a total of more than 10,000 laborers and more than 4,000 head of livestock. Since the vigorous promotion of comprehensive coal gas utilization and mass electricity generation, not only has the fuel difficulty of various machines been solved, but also a high degree of comprehensive utilization has been achieved. Wendeng County has a total of 235 power machines, and 185 of them are equipped with three to four agricultural machines each. In the past, they could not be used all year round due to a lack of fuel, but now they are all driven like a dragon.

(By our dispatch) Wusheng County, Sichuan, has basically prepared all kinds of summer harvest and planting materials, and the people's communes are repairing warehouses and leveling drying grounds to ensure good storage of summer grain.

This year, the area of summer harvest crops such as wheat in Wusheng County has expanded by 20% compared to last year, and the crops are generally growing well. According to surveys, the labor and production materials required for this year's summer harvest and planting have more than doubled compared to last year.

In terms of preparing summer harvest materials such as tools and fertilizers, the people's communes in Wusheng County generally conducted in-depth investigations in early this year, and then adopted a method combining professional production, sideline production, and mass shock tactics. Forty-seven ironware factories, 146 woodwork factories, 300 bamboo ware factories, and 95 palm ware factories have been established in the county's communes and management areas. More than 1,700 amateur factories have been opened to be responsible for producing the main agricultural tools. For tools with less technical requirements, such as hats and straw hats, the masses were organized to rush to produce them during the slack farming season. In this way, the county quickly produced more than 3 million pieces of major agricultural tools for summer harvest and planting, greatly exceeding the actual needs of the major agricultural tools for summer harvest and planting. At the same time, the communes in the county also built and renovated a large number of drying grounds, warehouses, and processing plants. The method of combining the three was promoted, building the drying ground, warehouse, and comprehensive grain processing plant together, so as to thresh, dry, store, and process locally, shortening the transportation distance and saving labor. The warehouses and processing plants built by the communes in the county are sufficient to store and process all summer harvest grain.

    改革工具实现半机械化　充分利用水风火作动力
    烟台专区争取七天收完小麦
    四川武胜县突击修补仓库平整晒场保证夏粮收好藏好
    本报讯　山东烟台专区一手抓技术革新、工具配套，一手抓动力——向自然界索取动力，要求今年小麦收割、脱粒、运输基本实现半机械化，做到七天收完麦，十天脱完粒，做好夏收夏种工作。
    这个专区的六百二十多万亩小麦正在拔节孕穗，生长情况比以往任何一年都好。今年小麦比去年扩大将近一百万亩，夏收夏播面积将比去年增加20％左右，而大面积丰产田又成方成片，都是一茬麦，成熟齐一。因此今年夏收夏种比任何一年任务重，用工多，时间紧。
    中共烟台地委分析了这些情况，早在春节前后就作了全面安排。现在全区农、工、商各部门大搞工具改革的重点，已转到夏收夏种方面来了。各县、社、队的农具机械制造修配厂，统统挂起钩来，全面包干；农、工、商各部门也携起手来，开展全面大协作，力求以收割、运输、脱粒直到入仓的各道工序中的先进工具配套成龙，做到样样得心应手。现在已修制各种先进机具二十四万件，运输工具已经基本实现胶轮化和滚珠轴承化。各工厂抽调的八千名技术工人，都纷纷带着红炉下乡，分头到各地传授技术，帮助生产。全区要求到5月下旬，生产出动力、手摇、马拉等各式收割机、脱粒机十万多台（件），争取有50％以上的小麦使用机械和半机械化工具收割，70％以上的小麦使用机械或半机械化工具脱粒。实现上述计划之后，将可使全区小麦收割、运输、脱粒基本实现半机械化，大约能节省一千一百八十万个劳动日，可做到七天割完麦，十天脱完粒。
    为了更好地推动农业机械化的实现，节约更多的劳力，烟台专区大搞水、风、火综合利用，千方百计解决动力问题。蓬莱县还创制了人力、畜力、风力三用水车，建立风力水车群，实现运输风篷化。现在全区已发展风力水车一万四千多部。这个专区随着大规模水利建设的发展，展开了一个全民大办水力站和水电站的群众运动，许多公社和生产队，都能自制土发电机。到上月底止，已投入生产的二百四十九处水力站和二十三处水电站，可带动各种钢磨、石磨三百多盘，每天可磨面三十五万斤，还可用来粉碎饲料、锯木、照明、浇地等，共可节约劳力一万多名，牲口四千多头。大力推广煤气综合利用和群众办电以来，不仅解决了各种机械的燃料困难，而且达到了高度的综合利用。文登县共有二百三十五台动力机，有一百八十五台每台配上了三至四部农业机械，过去因为燃料缺乏不能常年使用，现在都像一条龙一样全部带动起来了。
    本报讯　四川武胜县各种夏收夏种物资基本准备齐全，各人民公社正在修补仓库、平整晒坝，保证作好夏粮收藏工作。
    今年，武胜县小麦等夏收作物面积比去年扩大20％，普遍生长良好。根据调查，今年夏收夏种的需工量和生产资料需要量都比去年增加一倍以上。
    在工具、肥料等夏收物资准备方面，武胜县各人民公社普遍提前在今年年初就作了深入调查，然后采取专业生产、副业生产和群众性突击相结合的办法，全县各公社、管理区建立了四十七个铁器厂、一百四十六个木器厂、三百个竹器厂和九十五个棕器厂，并开办了一千七百多个业余工厂，负责生产主要农具，对斗笠、草帽等技术性不强的用具，则组织群众利用农闲突击生产。这样，全县迅速生产了夏收夏种主要农具三百多万件，大大超过夏收夏种主要农具的实际需要量。与此同时，全县各公社还大量新修和整修晒坝、仓库和加工厂。并推广三结合的办法，把晒坝、仓库和综合粮食加工厂建在一起，以便就地打、晒，就地储藏，就地加工，缩短运距，节约劳力。全县各公社已建成的仓库和加工厂足够收藏和加工全部夏收粮食。
