    Shanghai Primary and Secondary School Teaching Reform Gradually Deepens
    Teachers and Students Break the Old Teaching System and Create New Teaching Methods with Revolutionary Spirit

    (Our Report) Shanghai’s primary and secondary school teachers and students are actively engaged in teaching reform.
    The teaching reform in primary and secondary schools has developed on the basis of in-depth study of Mao Zedong Thought, driven by the upsurge of technological innovation and technological revolution on the industrial and agricultural fronts. The high-speed development of socialist construction has placed increasingly higher demands on improving education, making the phenomena of "less, slower, poorer, and more expensive" in teaching even more apparent. Everyone increasingly feels that if the "less, slower, poorer, and more expensive" phenomena in teaching are not quickly changed, they will lag far behind the development of the situation. At this time, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China convened the Leap Forward Conference on Cultural and Educational Work, followed by a city-wide mobilization meeting on teaching reform, further clarifying the direction of teaching reform. As a result, teaching reform quickly formed a surge throughout the city.
    This teaching reform, from the beginning, grasped the central link of the teaching content system. The curriculum reform committees of various subjects, composed of teachers from universities, middle schools, and primary schools, and working with East China Normal University, first exposed the "less, slower, poorer, and more expensive" phenomena such as the cyclical nature of curriculum settings and the outdated, repetitive, and cumbersome nature of teaching content, through investigation and research and extensive mobilization of the masses. For example, mathematics emphasizes that arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and trigonometry are separate systems, which separates shape and number and prevents them from being related to each other, so that students cannot comprehensively use the mathematical knowledge they learn. Middle school physics cannot reflect the new achievements of modern physical science. A middle school graduate who has studied physics for four years does not know what quantum mechanics and relativity are, nor does he understand the indivisibility of time, space, and material movement. Junior high school chemistry uses the 18th-century explanation of atomic structure, saying that atoms are indivisible, but this statement is overturned when entering high school, which brings unnecessary difficulties to teaching. In addition, much of the curriculum content is outdated, divorced from political struggle and production struggle, and is not compatible with current production and scientific and technological development.
    After analysis, many teachers realized that the root cause of these "less, slower, poorer, and more expensive" phenomena lies in being influenced by the old teaching system, which has not been fundamentally resolved for a long time. At present, preparations for thoroughly implementing reforms from the aspects of the school system and curriculum are actively underway. The Municipal Curriculum Reform Committee and East China Normal University are jointly formulating innovation plans for more than a dozen primary and secondary school courses such as Chinese, mathematics, physics, and chemistry, and have compiled dozens of new teaching materials based on these plans.
    Teachers have also exposed the formalism and subjectivism that exist in teaching methods, which are divorced from reality and do not proceed from effectiveness. For example, in the past, in teaching, regardless of the actual situation, the five links were used in a standardized way. Some primary schools used nine steps to teach a Chinese lesson, with small steps within large steps, and it took ten class hours to teach a text. In this teaching reform, teachers boldly created new teaching methods. The physics class at the City East Middle School, when teaching the second half of "The Nature of Light," originally had relatively isolated and scattered content, which was difficult for teachers to teach, and students did not like to listen, resulting in low teaching quality and requiring many class hours. Now, with the electromagnetic wave theory of light and the photon theory as the center, infrared rays, ultraviolet rays, "X" rays, etc., are unified in the electromagnetic spectrum in one class, so that students can obtain a complete concept of the nature of light, which improves quality and reduces class hours. After intensive lectures, there is extra time in classroom teaching, so students are organized as much as possible to do more exercises, more observations, and more experiments, so that students can draw their own conclusions. Much of the homework that was originally done outside of class in many subjects is now done in class. The vast majority have reached the level of understanding, consolidation, and proficiency. When improving teaching methods, teachers also fully estimated the subjective initiative of students and vigorously carried out the innovation of learning methods among students.
    After the teaching reform began, the majority of teachers realized that the development of the situation placed increasingly higher demands on them, and they urgently needed to improve themselves. They actively participated in the study of Mao Zedong Thought centered on the general line; and according to their professional needs, they participated in various advanced studies. The Municipal Education Institute and the Teachers' Red and Expert College have recently added various advanced study lectures for them. Some universities, middle schools, and primary schools have established cooperative relationships, with university teachers teaching middle school teachers and middle school teachers teaching primary school teachers. More often, they adopt the method of "those who are able are teachers" and self-reliance to improve the level of teachers. Many veteran teachers with relatively rich experience in their fields have also actively participated in learning, and a new atmosphere of catching up with each other, learning from each other, and helping each other has emerged.

### 上海中小学教学改革逐步深入  广大师生以革命精神打破旧的教学体系创造新的教学方法

    上海中小学教学改革逐步深入   
    广大师生以革命精神打破旧的教学体系创造新的教学方法
    本报讯　上海市中小学校的广大师生，积极进行教学改革。
    中小学的教学改革，是在深入学习毛泽东思想的基础上，工农业战线上技术革新、技术革命的大风暴推动下发展起来的。社会主义建设高速度的发展，对教育工作提高的要求越来越高，教学上少慢差费的情况就更加明显地暴露出来。大家越来越感觉到教学上少慢差费现象如果不迅速改变，就要大大落后于形势的发展。正在这个时候，中共上海市委召开了文教工作跃进大会，紧接着又召开了全市教学改革动员大会，进一步指明了教学改革的方向。于是，教学改革就迅速在全市形成了热潮。
    这次教学改革，一开始就抓住了教学内容体系这一中心环节。由大中小学的部分教师组成的各科课程革新委员会，和华东师范大学在一起，通过调查研究和广泛发动群众，首先揭发了课程设置循环，教学内容陈旧、重复、繁琐等少慢差费现象。如数学强调算术、代数、几何、三角四科各成体系之后，就使得形与数分家，互不联系，使学生学得的数学知识，不能综合运用。中学物理不能反映现代物理科学的新成就，一个中学毕业生学了四年物理，却不知道什么是量子力学和相对论，也不了解时间空间和物质运动的不可分割。初中化学对原子结构用十八世纪的讲法，说原子是不可分的，但是进入高中又推翻了这种讲法，给教学带来不应有的困难。此外有许多课程的内容陈旧，脱离政治斗争和生产斗争，同当前的生产、科学技术发展很不相适应。
    许多教师经过分析，认识到这些少慢差费现象的根本原因在于受到旧的教学体系的影响，长期来没有从根本上得到解决。目前，从学制课程等方面彻底实行改革的准备工作已在积极进行，市课程革新委员会和华东师范大学在一起制订了中小学语文、数学、物理、化学等十几门课程的革新方案，并且根据这些方案编写出几十种新的教材。
    教师们也揭发了教学方法上存在着的脱离实际和不从效果出发的形式主义、主观主义的做法。例如过去在教学中，不顾实际情况，千篇一律地搬用五个环节，有些小学教一篇语文，竟有九个步骤，大步骤中还有小步骤，一篇课文要用十个课时教完。在这次教学改革中，教师们大胆创造了新的教学方法。市东中学物理课，讲“光的本性”下半章，原来内容较为孤立分散，教师不易讲，学生不爱听，教学质量低，所需课时多。现在以光的电磁波学说和光子学说为中心，在一堂课中将红外线、紫外线、“X”射线等统一在电磁波谱中，使学生得到完整的光的本性概念，提高了质量，减少了课时。精讲以后，课堂教学的时间有了多余，就尽可能地组织学生多练习、多观察、多实验，让学生自己作结论。不少学科原来在课外做的作业，现在移在课内进行了。绝大部分达到了理解、巩固、熟练的程度。教师在改进教学方法时，还充分估计了学生的主观能动性，在学生中大搞学习方法革新。
    开始教学改革以后，广大教师认识到形势的发展对自己的要求越来越高，迫切要求提高自己，都积极地参加以总路线为中心的毛泽东思想学习；又根据各人业务上的需要，参加各种进修。市教育学院和教师红专学院最近为他们增设各种进修讲座。部分大中小学建立了挂钩协作关系，大学教师为中学教师上课，中学教师为小学教师上课。更多的是采取能者为师，自力更生的办法，来提高教师水平。许多业务上比较有经验的老教师也纷纷参加学习，出现了你追我赶、互学互帮的新气象。
