Xinhua News Agency, Havana, May 9th: Cuban Minister of Revolutionary Armed Forces, Raúl Castro, revealed this morning that the United States is conspiring to remove the dictator Trujillo from the Dominican Republic through the Organization of American States in order to create a false image of anti-dictatorship, thereby enhancing the "prestige" of the Organization of American States, and then use this precedent to interfere in Cuba.

Raúl Castro made these remarks at the final meeting of the Rural Women's and Havana Women's Congress held here today. More than one thousand representatives from across the country participated in the conference.

Raúl Castro pointed out that the dictatorial regimes of Latin America are puppets manipulated by U.S. imperialists. But the United States is prepared to sacrifice Trujillo in order to launch a collective aggression against Cuba under the pretext that the Cuban revolutionary government is a "red dictatorship."

In his speech, he also mentioned the revolutionary thought of the Cuban anti-imperialist fighter Antonio Guiteras. Yesterday was the anniversary of Guiteras' death. Guiteras said that without opposing U.S. imperialism, there could be no Cuban revolution. Raúl Castro emphasized, "That is why they killed him. But what he said is the truth."

Raúl Castro emphasized that today all the Cuban people are convinced of Guiteras' words. They shouted "No Yankees, Cuba yes" on May Day.

Raúl Castro pointed out that it is difficult to eliminate six million Cubans. The Cuban people have the support of two hundred million Latin American people, the support of six hundred million people in the distant lands, the support of billions of people even further away, and the support of billions of people in the nearby African continent. He said that these billions of people will make their voices heard all over the world, and they are helping us because the problems we face, our needs, and the threats we encounter are similar to theirs.

He exposed the lie that Cuba is preparing to invade Guatemala. He said that, in any case, the people of Guatemala will settle accounts with the Ydígoras regime themselves.

Raúl Castro finally emphasized that despite the pressure and threats from the imperialists, the Cuban revolution will continue to advance with the support of the people, until "it reaches where it should reach."

    不反对美帝国主义就不可能有古巴革命
    劳尔·卡斯特罗谴责美国干涉古巴
    新华社哈瓦那9日电　古巴革命武装部部长劳尔·卡斯特罗今天清晨揭露说，美国正阴谋通过美洲国家组织去掉多米尼加的独裁者特鲁希略以造成反独裁的假象，从而提高美洲国家组织的“威信”，然后再利用这个先例来干涉古巴。
    劳尔·卡斯特罗的这番话是在这里今天举行的农村妇女和哈瓦那妇女大会的最后一次会议上讲的。全国一千多名代表参加了这次会议。
    劳尔·卡斯特罗指出，拉丁美洲的独裁政权是美帝国主义者操纵的傀儡。但是美国准备牺牲特鲁希略，以便于在古巴革命政府是“红色独裁政权”的借口下，发动对古巴的集体侵略。
    他在讲话中还提到了古巴反帝战士安东尼奥·吉特拉斯的革命思想。昨天是吉特拉斯被害的周年纪念。吉特拉斯说过，不反对美帝国主义就不可能有古巴革命。劳尔·卡斯特罗强调说，“他们因此杀害了他。但他所说的是真理。”
    劳尔·卡斯特罗强调说，今天全体古巴人民都确信吉特拉斯的这些话。他们在五一节时高呼“不要美国佬，要古巴”。
    劳尔·卡斯特罗指出，要消灭六百万古巴人是困难的。古巴人民有二亿拉丁美洲人民的支持，有远方的六亿人民的支持，还有更远方的亿万人民的支持和较近些的非洲大陆亿万人民的支持。他说，这亿万人民将使他们的呼声响遍全世界，他们援助我们是因为我们面对的问题、我们的需要和所遭到的威胁是与他们相似的。
    他戳穿了古巴正在准备入侵危地马拉的谎言。他说，无论如何，危地马拉人民将自己来清算伊迪戈拉斯政权。
    劳尔·卡斯特罗最后调强说尽管帝国主义者施加压力和威胁，古巴革命在人民的支持下将继续前进，直到“它应该到达的地方为止”。
