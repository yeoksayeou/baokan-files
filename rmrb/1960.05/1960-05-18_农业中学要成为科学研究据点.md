Agricultural Middle Schools Should Become Scientific Research Strongholds
Commentator of this Newspaper

With the arrival of the upsurge in rural technical innovation and technical revolution, many agricultural science and technology problems urgently need to be solved. The teachers and students of agricultural middle schools are a very powerful intellectual force in the countryside, and they have the responsibility to take on this glorious and arduous task.

The scientific research activities carried out by agricultural middle schools should not be purely academic activities, but activities to further improve the level of local agricultural production. Therefore, the scientific research of agricultural middle schools must start from implementing the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" and focus on the problem of increasing the production of local major crops. Within the scope of the people's communes, soil and other conditions vary, and crops are also very complex. When agricultural middle schools carry out scientific research activities, they must conduct in-depth investigations and research on local conditions and carry out work according to local characteristics, conditions, and needs. Teachers and students of agricultural middle schools should establish lofty ambitions, strive to exceed the local unit area yield of crops, and set an example in the main aspects of agricultural technology transformation, so that agricultural middle schools can gradually become scientific research strongholds of the people's communes. In the past two years, many agricultural middle schools have carried out scientific experiments and established the red flag of high yields. Faced with the fruitful results, the masses no longer think that "agricultural middle schools only learn the work of peasants and have nothing to learn," but feel that there is much to learn. Today, under the leadership and support of the Party Committee of the People's Commune, agricultural middle schools widely carry out scientific research activities and will surely achieve greater achievements. In the future, rural scientific research will be more arduous and involve more aspects. Teachers and students of agricultural middle schools must not be satisfied with the existing achievements, but must carry forward the glorious tradition of hard struggle and humbly learn from the masses, and be primary school students of the masses. Only by learning from the masses can the scientific research of agricultural middle schools continuously improve and better complete the current new tasks. Some agricultural middle schools have not yet seriously carried out agricultural scientific research work, and these agricultural middle schools should quickly start this work.

Of course, under the current economic conditions, agricultural middle schools will encounter many difficulties in carrying out scientific research activities, such as a lack of instruments, equipment, funds, and technical personnel. What should be done in the face of these difficulties? In the past two years, the teachers and students of agricultural middle schools have overcome various difficulties, so that the new seedlings of agricultural middle schools have taken root in the countryside and become "treasures" and "gold" in the eyes of the masses. Now, tens of millions of energetic teachers and students have投入 a new battle, and under the leadership of the Party, they will surely be able to overcome the difficulties on the road ahead. The teachers and students of Chumaolu Agricultural Middle School in Lai'an County, Anhui Province, are carrying out scientific research with poor conditions and a lack of instruments and equipment. Instead of shaking their heads and sighing in the face of difficulties, they are not looking upwards and adopting the "hand-stretching" method, but are using their brains and using their own hands to make 土 instruments, and the research results are very good. In this way, they rely on their own efforts to create conditions for scientific research. We do not ignore the decisive role of objective conditions, but we believe that giving play to people's subjective initiative can often create conditions or turn unfavorable conditions into favorable conditions. We should observe all things from the perspective of dialectical materialism, and conditions are not immutable. With the rapid development of the national and people's commune economy, the scientific research conditions of agricultural middle schools will become better and better, and instruments and equipment will be gradually improved, which is beyond doubt. Our emphasis on self-reliance does not mean rejecting external assistance. We not only do not reject external assistance, but also want to further promote this communist spirit of cooperation. In the future, the task of rural scientific research will become increasingly heavy. On the basis of self-reliance, agricultural middle schools should better strive for the cooperation and assistance of relevant parties. Some problems that they cannot solve themselves can be solved with the assistance of the people's commune and county scientific research institutions, farms, etc. Recently, some agricultural middle schools have carried out scientific research activities, adopting methods such as combining with people's communes and experimental stations or linking with production teams to solve problems such as equipment and technical guidance. These practices are worth paying attention to.

Agricultural middle schools are half-day schools with half-day study and half-day production labor. Scientific research must be closely centered on production and combined with teaching, and its purpose is to improve teaching quality and promote the development of production. Through scientific research, students will have a deeper understanding of the knowledge in books, develop a strong interest in science, and at the same time, they can cultivate the confidence and determination of teachers and students to transform nature and build a new socialist and communist countryside. We believe that the three combinations of teaching, productive labor and scientific research in agricultural middle schools will greatly improve the level of agricultural middle schools.

This is the exchange of experience between teachers and students and commune members.

    农业中学要成为科学研究据点
    本报评论员
    随着农村技术革新和技术革命高潮的到来，许多农业科学技术问题迫待人们去解决。农业中学的师生是农村里一支力量很大的知识分子队伍，他们有责任把这副光荣的重担挑起来。
    农业中学开展科学研究活动，不应当是单纯的学术性活动，而是为了进一步提高当地的农业生产水平的活动。因此，农业中学的科学研究必须以贯彻农业“八字宪法”为出发点，要抓住当地主要农作物的增产问题进行研究。在人民公社的范围内，土壤等条件各不相同，农作物也十分复杂，农业中学在开展科学研究活动时，要深入调查研究当地的情况，根据当地的特点、条件、需要进行工作。农业中学的师生要树立雄心大志，力争农作物单位面积产量超过当地，并在农业技术改造的主要方面树立榜样，这样，才能使农业中学逐步成为人民公社的科学研究据点。在过去两年中，许多农业中学进行科学试验，树立了高额丰产的红旗，在累累硕果的面前，群众不再认为“农业中学不过学些庄稼汉的活，没有学头”，而是觉得大有可学了。今天，农业中学在人民公社党委的领导和支持下，广泛开展科学研究活动，一定会取得更大的成就。以后农村的科学研究将更加繁重，涉及的方面也将更广泛，农业中学的师生们决不能满足于已有的成绩，要发扬艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，虚心向群众学习，做群众的小学生，只有向群众学习，才能使农业中学的科学研究不断进步，才能更好地完成当前的新任务。有些农业中学还没有认真进行农业科学的研究工作，这些农业中学应当把把这一工作迅速开展起来。
    当然，在目前的经济条件下，农业中学开展科学研究活动还会遇到许多困难，如缺乏仪器、设备、经费和技术人员等。面对这些困难应当怎么办？农业中学的师生们，在过去的两年里，曾经克服了种种困难，使农业中学这枝新苗在农村扎下了根，成为群众心目中的“宝贝”、“金子”。现在，成千万朝气蓬勃的教师和学生又投入了一个新的战斗，他们在党的领导下，一定能够克服前进道路上的困难。安徽省来安县储茂农业中学的师生们开展科学研究，条件很差，缺乏仪器和设备，他们在困难面前不是摇头叹气，也不是眼睛朝上，采取“伸手派”的办法，而是开动脑筋，用自己的双手制作了土仪器，研究效果很好，他们就这样自力更生为自己创造了科学研究的条件。我们并不忽视客观条件的决定作用，但是，我们认为，发挥人的主观能动性往往能够创造条件，或者使不利条件改变为有利条件。我们应该以辩证唯物主义的观点去观察一切事物，条件不是一成不变的东西。随着国家和人民公社经济的飞跃发展，农业中学的科学研究条件将越来越好，仪器、设备将会逐步完善，这是不容怀疑的。我们强调自力更生并不等于排斥外力援助。我们不仅毫不排斥外力援助，而且要使这种共产主义的协作精神进一步得到发扬光大，今后农村的科学研究任务将日益繁重，农业中学在自力更生的基础上，要更好地争取有关方面的协作和帮助，有些自己不能解决的问题，可以请人民公社和县的科学研究机构、农场等协助解决。近来，有些农业中学开展科学研究活动，采取同人民公社和实验站合一或同生产队挂钩等办法，解决设备、技术指导等问题，这些作法值得重视。
    农业中学是半天学习半天生产劳动的半日制学校，开展科学研究必须紧紧围绕生产，结合教学，其目的是为了提高教学质量，促进生产的发展。学生们通过科学研究，将更深刻地理解书本中知识，对科学发生浓厚的兴趣，同时，还可以培养师生们对于改造自然、建设社会主义和共产主义新农村的信心和决心。我们相信，农业中学的教学、生产劳动和科学研究的三结合，将会使农业中学的水平大大提高一步。（附图片）
