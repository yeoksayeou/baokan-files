Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 17th: Progressive Indian public opinion refutes Indian Prime Minister Nehru's recent remarks at a press conference in London attacking China.

The Hindi "People's Century" weekly in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, in an editorial titled "Shameful Statement" published on May 8th, said, what kind of argument is Nehru's claim that China's population and industrial growth and development will lead to attacking other countries and undermining peace? "According to this argument, Asia and Africa should continue to remain backward and undeveloped, just as the imperialists have always done. We know that under British rule, the imperialists always said that our country was very large and that the growing population was the main cause of all our troubles. And Nehru is using a similar argument to insist that China is a danger to the world."

The editorial said that if this argument is correct, then India has also become a danger to world peace and other countries, because India's population is also growing rapidly, and with India's five-year plans, India is also developing industry.

The editorial said, "These arguments are shameful arguments, unfortunate arguments." "It is really strange that as soon as he (Nehru) arrived in London, he seemed to have forgotten that imperialism still exists. He forgot that American imperialists are encircling the world with their military bases—including nuclear weapons bases. He forgot that a million American armed forces are occupying the territories of other countries outside the United States. He forgot that in order to split Taiwan, an inseparable part of Chinese territory, the US Seventh Fleet is still encircling China's coast in the Pacific Ocean. He also forgot the colonies of the British imperialists and their fraudulent tricks. Nehru also forgot that the Dutch imperialists are still sending warships to maintain their control over West Irian in Indonesia. With the support of the United States, the fascist demons are reviving in West Germany, and not long ago, Hitler's swastika symbols appeared on the walls of buildings in different parts of the world on the same day, all of which he forgot." The editorial said that he also forgot that the fascist rulers of the United States and West Germany tried every means to sabotage the summit conference in Paris. He even forgot about India's Goa. The editorial said, "He breathes with the same nostrils as Masani of the Liberal Party, the Indian People's Alliance, and the People's Socialist Party, and even claims that the danger to world peace now does not come from the imperialists, but from socialist China."

The editorial pointed out that Nehru's statement is not only contrary to reality, but also inconsistent with what Nehru himself has told the Indian people in the past.

The editorial said, "Socialism has become a reality that actually exists, and has been for more than forty-three years. But as Nehru himself knows as a historian, no socialist country has ever occupied the territory of another country or invaded another country."

The editorial said, "By supporting imperialist propaganda and opposing socialist countries in this way, Nehru not only undermines people's belief in socialism, thereby harming the domestic socialist movement, but also shelters the imperialists and their activities to undermine and infringe upon world peace and freedom, and disarms the people against imperialism."

The editorial said, "The failure to resolve the border dispute between India and China is itself an unfortunate thing. And using such language to widen mutual differences and complicate the problem and make it difficult to resolve is in fact both unwise and dishonest."

The editorial, when talking about China's relations with countries such as Burma and Nepal, pointed out, "China has not swallowed them up, but has eliminated mutual differences with them and reached agreements on the basis of equality and on the basis of Panchsheel. If not today, then tomorrow, it will be the same with India. It must be so. Therefore, this kind of unreasonable and rude language, in addition to benefiting the imperialists, will not make anyone happy and will not benefit anyone."

The editorial said, "The Chinese also have their own self-esteem. The words 'expansionist', 'imperialist', etc., are a great slander against the Chinese people."

The Tamil "People's Power" weekly published an editorial on May 6th entitled "Nehru's Slander," saying, "From the press conference held in London, one can understand that slander is one of Nehru's weapons against China."

The editorial said, "Up to now, the imperialists, especially the American imperialists, have used all kinds of despicable slanders against the Communist Parties of various countries in the world. Nehru also uses the same tone to attack China. His voice comes from London, the camp of imperialism."

The editorial continued, "According to our Prime Minister, the rapid development of Chinese industry and the growth of the Chinese population will pose a threat to world peace. Doesn't this make people feel surprised?" "According to Nehru's words, if someone asks, will the growth of Indian industry and population seriously threaten neighboring countries such as Burma, Malaya, Pakistan, and Nepal, how will Nehru answer?"

The editorial pointed out, "The so-called statement that the growth of a country's industry and population determines whether it adopts a peaceful policy or an aggressive policy is either a lack of historical knowledge or a deliberate fabrication with historical knowledge."

The editorial said, "Nehru's improper slander against China is not the attitude that should be taken towards a friendly neighbor. China is a socialist country, and its economy is developing rapidly. This rapid development has surprised the whole world. This should normally be admired, but Nehru has taken a slanderous attitude, which is unfair."

The editorial said that India has taken the capitalist road to solve its own problems, but it has encountered unsolvable difficulties. The situation is just the opposite in China. An atmosphere of liking to follow the Chinese road has spread among the masses of our people. Is Nehru, who maintains the capitalist system, slandering in order to prevent the people from imitating China? Does he think that taking the attitude suggested by Rajagopalachari (leader of the Indian Liberal Party) can get assistance from Western imperialists?"

The editorial emphasized, "It should be pointed out that this is not the correct path; this is a path that violates our country's interests."

### 印度“人民世纪”周刊和“人民力量”周报指出    尼赫鲁诽谤中国只对帝国主义有利    按照他的论据亚非两洲就应该保持落后和不发达状态

    印度“人民世纪”周刊和“人民力量”周报指出
    尼赫鲁诽谤中国只对帝国主义有利
    按照他的论据亚非两洲就应该保持落后和不发达状态
    新华社新德里17日电　印度进步舆论驳斥印度总理尼赫鲁最近在伦敦举行的记者招待会上攻击中国的言论。
    北方邦勒克瑙的印地文“人民世纪”周刊在5月8日发表的以“可耻的声明”为题的社论说，尼赫鲁所谓中国的人口和工业的增长和发展，将导致攻击其它国家并破坏和平，这是什么论据？“照这种说法，亚非两洲应该继续保持落后和不发达状态，就像帝国主义者一直作的那样。我们知道，在英国统治下，帝国主义者总是说我国很大，日益增长的人口是我们的一切麻烦的主要原因。而尼赫鲁正是借助于类似的论据硬说中国是对世界的危险。”
    社论说，如果这个论据是正确的话，那么印度也成了对世界和平和其它国家的危险，因为印度的人口增长也很快，而且随着印度的五年计划，印度也在发展工业。
    社论说，“这些论据是可耻的论据，不幸的论据”。“实在奇怪的是，他（尼赫鲁）一到伦敦，好像就忘记了帝国主义还存在着。他忘记了美帝国主义者用自己的军事基地——包括核武器基地——包围全世界。他忘记了一百万美国武装部队在美国国外占领着其它国家的领土。他忘记了，为了分裂中国领土的不可分割的一部分台湾，美国第七舰队甚至现在还在太平洋包围中国的沿海地带。他也忘记了英帝国主义者的殖民地以及他们的诈骗伎俩。尼赫鲁还忘记了，荷兰帝国主义者还派遣军舰去保持他们对印度尼西亚的西伊里安的控制。在美国支持下，法西斯主义的恶魔正在西德复活，而且在前不久，希特勒的卍字标志同一天在世界不同地方的建筑物的墙上出现，以上这些他都忘记了。”社论说，他还忘记了，美国和西德的法西斯统治者想尽办法破坏在巴黎举行的最高级会议。他甚至忘记了印度的果阿。社论说，“他同自由党的马萨尼、同印度人民同盟、同人民社会党一鼻孔出气，而竟然声称：现在对世界和平的危险，不是来自帝国主义者，而是来自社会主义中国。”
    社论指出，尼赫鲁这样的声明不仅同现实背道而驰，而且也是同尼赫鲁自己在过去告诉印度人民的话不相符合的。
    社论说，“社会主义成为实际上存在的现实，现在已经有四十三年以上了。但是正如尼赫鲁自己作为历史家知道的那样，迄今没有一个社会主义国家占领过另一个国家的领土或侵犯另一个国家。”
    社论说，“尼赫鲁这样支持帝国主义宣传而反对社会主义国家，他不仅打击人民对社会主义的信念，从而损害国内的社会主义运动，而且是包庇帝国主义者以及他们破坏和侵犯世界和平和自由的活动，并解除人民反对帝国主义的武装。”
    社论说，“印度和中国之间的边界争端未能解决，这本身是一件不幸的事情。而用这类言词使相互之间的分歧扩大，并且使问题复杂化和难以解决，事实上这既是不明智的，也是不正直的。
    社论在谈到中国同缅甸、尼泊尔等国的关系时指出，“中国没有吞掉它们，而是同它们一道消除了相互之间的分歧，并在平等的基础上，在潘查希拉的基础上获致了协议。如果不是今天，那么在明天，同印度也将是这样。必须是这样。因此，这种无理的粗暴言词，除了有利于帝国主义者以外，不会使任何人高兴，不会对任何人有利。”
    社论说，“中国人也有自己的自尊心。‘扩张主义的’、
  ‘帝国主义的’等等字眼，是对中国人的莫大的污蔑。”
    泰米尔文“人民力量”周报5月6日发表的题为“尼赫鲁的诽谤”的社论说，“从在伦敦举行的记者招待会上，人们可以了解到，诽谤是尼赫鲁对付中国的武器之一。”
    社论说，“到现在为止，帝国主义者，特别是美帝国主义者对世界各国共产党使用了各种卑鄙的诽谤。尼赫鲁也用同样的口吻来攻击中国。他的声音是从帝国主义阵营的伦敦发出来的。”
    社论接着说，“据我国总理说，中国工业的迅速发展和中国人口的增长将造成对世界和平的威胁。这种话难道不会使人们感到惊奇吗？”“根据尼赫鲁的话，如果有人问，印度工业和人口的增长将严重地威胁着像缅甸、马来亚、巴基斯坦和尼泊尔这些邻国，尼赫鲁将怎么回答呢？”
    社论指出，“所谓国家的工业和人口的增长决定着它采取和平政策或者侵略政策的说法，或者是缺乏历史知识，或者是有历史知识而蓄意虚构。”
    社论说，“尼赫鲁对中国进行的不正当的诽谤不是对一个友好的邻国应有的态度。中国是社会主义国家，它的经济正在迅速发展。这种迅速的发展已经使全世界感到惊奇。这一点本应正常地受到钦佩，但是尼赫鲁却采取了诽谤的态度，这是不公道的。”
    社论说，印度采取了资本主义的道路来解决自己的问题，但是却遭到了无法解决的困难。这种情况同中国正好相反。喜欢走中国道路的气氛已经在我国人民群众中间传播开了。保持资本主义制度的尼赫鲁进行诽谤是不是为了阻止人民仿效中国呢？他是不是认为采取拉贾戈帕拉查里（印度自由党首领）建议的态度，可以从西方帝国主义者那里得到援助呢？”
    社论强调说，“应当指出，这不是正确的道路；这是违反我国利益的道路。”
