Xinhua News Agency, May 24th. After a grand performance, evaluation, and summary identification by over 5,000 innovation experts in the national financial and trade system, the national financial and trade departments have initially proposed promoting over 1,000 innovation projects. The National Financial and Trade Departments' Technical Innovation and Technical Revolution Performance Conference successfully concluded this afternoon after completing this major task.

Li Xiannian, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, Ma Mingfang, Minister of the CPC Central Committee's Financial and Trade Department, and heads of central financial and trade departments such as Yao Yilin, Ye Jizhuang, Niu Peicong, Sha Qianli, and Cao Juru attended today's closing ceremony. Li Xiannian delivered an important speech at the meeting. He said that this conference was very successful. Through the conference, the representatives learned from each other, improved together, and selected a number of projects for promotion. After this conference, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the financial and trade departments, centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation, will surely leap to a new stage, and the level of manual operation will also be greatly improved. He then gave a detailed report on the current situation, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the financial and trade departments, and the comprehensive utilization of resources. After Li Xiannian's report, Ma Mingfang, on behalf of the conference, awarded over 5,000 certificates to advanced collectives and individuals who had made outstanding achievements in the technical revolution movement.

During the conference, the representatives held medium-sized meetings by department, conducted tool operation performances and manual operation performances, exchanged experiences by specialty, and conducted evaluations and identifications. Finally, after discussions by each department, over 1,000 projects for promotion were initially proposed.

These projects broadly fall into two categories. One part consists of various innovative tools and advanced experiences created by the financial and trade departments to support industrial and agricultural production and collective welfare undertakings. The other part consists of sales, calculation, inspection, and storage tools and advanced experiences to improve the management level of the financial and trade departments themselves. These tools generally save a lot of labor, have significant economic effects, and can be made from local materials.

The commercial departments have initially proposed promoting over 540 innovative machines. In addition, there are 29 linked lines, 51 automatic lines, and 30 technical experiences. These innovative machines are divided into nine aspects: agricultural product procurement and processing, non-staple food processing, native and waste product processing, warehousing and transportation, and catering services. The more than 100 innovative tools promoted by departments such as agricultural product procurement and processing and production materials supply are of great significance for saving rural labor. For example, the cotton stalk peeling machine created in Beijing can peel 50 to 60 jin of cotton stalk skin per hour, which is 15 times more efficient than manual operation. If it is widely promoted nationwide, it can save more than 460,000 laborers per year. The all-purpose linked threshing machine created by the Boli County Commercial Bureau in Heilongjiang Province can thresh 3.5 tons of rice or 4.5 tons of wheat per hour, which is 15 times more efficient than manual labor. The projects promoted by department stores, textiles, and other industries have greatly helped to improve business management and service levels. For example, the all-purpose cloth-selling counter created by the Ximo Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Ruicheng County, Shanxi, can measure body size, release cloth, measure cloth, cut cloth, calculate prices, and make change with coins. It is also convenient for customers to choose colors and varieties, has high work efficiency, is simple to manufacture, and is suitable for rural stores and urban suburban stores.

The grain department plans to promote over 200 tools in the fields of grain and oil processing, warehousing and transportation, and comprehensive utilization of grain and oil by-products, as well as cooking tools and stoves used in rural public canteens. Among them are mobile small wind-powered suction conveyors for transporting grain, automatic cooling machines, automatic weighing machines, and baling machines for warehouses, safety belt hanging tools for grain processing plants, and small-mouth return air insulation stoves and all-purpose steam stoves for rural canteens. The small wind-powered suction conveyor created in Jiangsu does not require people to carry it on their backs or shoulders, and does not require sacks. As long as a thick pipe is installed with a blower, the grain can be sucked into the warehouse or carriage by using wind power. It can transport 10 tons of grain per hour. This suction conveyor can solve the problem of occupying a large amount of labor in grain loading, unloading, and transportation work. The small-mouth return air insulation stove created in Henan has a very ingenious structure and can make full use of thermal efficiency. One stove can cook food for 200 to 300 people, and each person uses an average of less than two liang of wheat straw. Its promotion in rural areas saves both labor and fuel.

The Foreign Trade Department has decided to promote a total of 144 tools and machines nationwide, of which five projects are also planned to be performed on tour in various places. These promotion projects include advanced experiences such as "seeking treasures from live poultry and livestock" to increase export sources, and advanced machines such as tobacco leaf flattening machines, hand-cranked walnut smashing machines, and foot-operated single-bucket all-purpose diverter screens to improve labor efficiency and save labor. "Seeking treasures from live poultry and livestock" is a major innovation in livestock product production methods. In the past, except for wool, cashmere, and horse mane and tail, bristles were generally extracted after slaughter. Employees of the livestock production department have created advanced experiences such as live pig bristle pulling, live goose, duck, and chicken feather pulling, live cattle, horse, mule, and donkey hair pulling, and goat beard trimming by using the law of natural molting of livestock and poultry in warm weather and the principle of metabolism. After the nationwide promotion of this innovation project, if calculated according to the existing livestock and poultry in the country, the annual increase in livestock products such as bristles, tails, feathers, and down can increase the income of the masses by 130 million yuan.

The Finance Department promotes more than 100 advanced experiences and various machines, including various financial accounting tools for enterprises, accounting tools for carrying out mass economic accounting movements, financial accounting tools for communes, and machines used by the finance department itself for calculating profits, taxes, planned targets, typing accounting, drawing tables, and printing. Among them, the rural people's commune economic accounting tools created in Heilongjiang Province have a total of six sets, which can account for indicators in six aspects: land, fertilizer, labor work points, production costs, seeds, and sideline businesses. After the communes adopt these simple accounting tools, efficiency can be increased by four to thirty times.

The banking system has initially determined to promote more than 150 machines and 38 advanced experiences in manual operation. They belong to various business links such as teller, accounting, savings, statistics, printing, typing, and printing in banks. These include electric and hand-cranked dual-purpose micro-accounting machines, electric bill counting machines, television-style interest calculation machines, and coin counting and packaging combined machines. These machines have the characteristics of high efficiency, convenient use, elimination of errors, and guaranteed quality.

In order to better promote these experiences, the conference has specially set up an exhibition hall to display various innovative tools, which is planned to be exhibited for three months, and financial and trade employees from all over the country will be organized to come to observe and learn in batches.

    财贸部门技术革命表演大会完成总结、评比任务
    千余技术革新项目将遍地开花
    新华社24日讯　经过全国财贸系统五千多位革新能手的大表演、大评比和总结鉴定，全国财贸部门初步提出推广一千多项革新项目。全国财贸部门技术革新和技术革命表演大会在完成这一重大任务后，今天下午胜利闭幕。
    中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理李先念、中共中央财贸部部长马明方和中央财贸各部门负责人姚依林、叶季壮、牛佩琮、沙千里、曹菊如等出席了今天的闭幕式。李先念在会上作了重要讲话。他说，这次会议开得很好。代表们通过会议互相学习、互相提高，并评选出了一批推广项目。这次大会以后，财贸部门以机械化、半机械化，自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革新、技术革命运动，一定会跃进到一个新的阶段，手工操作的水平也将大大提高。他接着就当前形势、财贸部门的技术革新、技术革命运动和资源的综合利用等问题，作了详细报告。李先念报告后，马明方代表大会把五千多面奖状授给在技术革命运动中创造了优异成绩的先进集体和先进个人。
    这次大会期间，代表们分别按部门举行了中型会议，进行了工具操作表演和手工操作表演，又按专业交流了经验，进行了评比、鉴定，最后经各部门讨论，初步提出了一千多项推广项目。
    这些项目大体上属于两个方面。一部分是财贸部门为支援工农业生产和集体生活福利事业而创制的各项革新工具和先进经验。一部分是提高财贸部门本身经营管理水平的销售、计算、检验、保管工具和先进经验。这些工具一般都能节省大量劳动力，经济效果显著，可以就地取材，就地制造。
    商业部门初步提出推广的革新机具有五百四十多项。另外，还有二十九条联动线、五十一条自动线和三十项技术经验。这些革新机具分为农产品采购加工、副食品加工、土产废品加工、仓储运输、饮食服务等九个方面。农产品采购加工、生产资料供应等部门推广的一百多项革新工具，对节约农村劳动力有重大意义。如北京市创制的剥棉秆皮机，每小时能剥棉秆皮五十到六十市斤，比手工操作提高效率十五倍。如果在全国普遍推广，每年可以节约劳动力四十六万多人。黑龙江省勃利县商业局创造的万能联动脱谷机，每小时可脱水稻三吨半或小麦四吨半，比手工提高效率十五倍。百货、纺织等行业推广的项目对改善经营管理、提高服务水平有很大作用。如山西芮城县西陌供销总店创造的万能售布柜，既能量体、放布、量布、剪布、计价找零硬币，又便于顾客挑选花色品种，工效高，制造简单，适合于农村商店和城市郊区商店使用。
    粮食部门计划推广的有粮油加工、仓储运输、粮油副产品综合利用等方面的工具，以及农村公共食堂使用的炊事工具，炉灶等二百多项。其中有运送粮食用的移动式小型风动吸运机，仓库用的自动降温机、自动过磅机、打包机，粮食加工厂用的安全挂皮带工具，农村食堂用的小口回风保温灶、万能蒸汽灶等。江苏创造的小型风动吸运机，不用人背肩扛，不用麻袋，只要一个粗管子，安上鼓风机，就可以利用风力把粮食吸到仓库或车厢里。每小时可以运送十吨粮食。这种吸运机可以解决粮食装卸运输工作中占用劳动力较多的问题。河南创造的小口回风保温灶的构造非常巧妙，可以充分利用热效能，一个灶可以烧二、三百人吃的饭菜，每人平均用不到二两麦秸，在农村推广既省劳动力又省燃料。
    对外贸易部门决定在全国推广的工具和机械共计一百四十四项，其中有五个项目还准备到各地巡回表演。这些推广项目中有增加出口货源的“向活禽、活畜要宝”等先进经验，有提高劳动效率节约劳动力的烟叶平摊机、手摇砸核桃机、脚踏单斗式万能分路筛等先进机具。“向活禽、活畜要宝”是目前畜产品生产方法的一个重大革新、过去除羊毛、羊绒、马鬃尾外，一般都是在屠宰后拔取鬃毛，畜产部门职工运用天暖畜禽自然脱毛的规律和新陈代谢的原理，创造了活猪拔鬃、活鹅鸭鸡拔羽毛、活牛、马、骡、驴拔毛、山羊剪胡子等先进经验。这一革新项目在全国推广以后，如按全国现有畜、禽估算，一年增产的鬃、尾、羽毛、绒毛等畜产品可以使群众增加一亿三千万元的收入。
    财政部门推广的先进经验和各种机具有一百多项，包括各种企业财务核算工具，开展群众性经济核算运动的核算工具，公社财务核算工具和财政部门本身计算利润、税收、计划指标、打字记账、绘表文印等方面所用的机具。其中黑龙江省创造的农村人民公社经济核算工具共有六套，能够核算土地、肥料、劳动工分、生产费用、种子、副业六个方面的指标。公社采用这些简易核算工具以后，可以提高效率四倍到三十倍。
    银行系统初步确定推广的项目有一百五十多件机具和手工操作的三十八项先进经验。它们分别属于银行的出纳、会计、储蓄、统计、印制、打字文印等各个业务环节。其中包括电动、手摇两用微型记账机，电动点钞机，电视式利息查算机，硬币清点包封联合机等。这些机具都具有效率高、使用方便、消灭差错、保证质量的特点。
    为了更好地推广这些经验，大会专门设立了陈列各种革新工具的展览馆，计划展出三个月，分批组织各地财贸职工前来观摩、学习。
