Running Dog of U.S. Imperialism, Public Enemy of the Japanese People
Traitor Nobusuke Kishi's Heinous Crimes
Kishi Nobusuke, disregarding the firm opposition of the Japanese people, employed fascist violence to forcibly "pass" the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty in the House of Representatives, thoroughly exposing Kishi Nobusuke's true colors as a militarist, and once again demonstrating that he is a running dog of U.S. imperialism and an enemy of the Japanese people.

Accomplice of Hideki Tojo, Launched War of Aggression
Kishi Nobusuke made his start with anti-communism and anti-people activities and is a Class A war criminal involved in launching the war of aggression. When he was studying at Tokyo Imperial University, he engaged in the criminal activity of persecuting progressive students. His classmate, Japan Socialist Party member Hyoei Hara, once described his face in the "Asahi Shimbun" as: "Kishi Nobusuke is full of the stench of fascism." After Kishi Nobusuke entered the political arena, he tried his best to serve the big capitalists and participated in the Japanese militarist aggression against China very early on. He served as the "Vice Minister of Industry" in charge of all economic power and the "Vice Minister of General Affairs" in charge of secrets in the puppet "Manchukuo," and was called the "Five Tigers" who manipulated the puppet "Manchukuo" together with the most aggressive Kwantung Army warlord Hideki Tojo, doing all the bad things to exploit and harm the Chinese people. He also served as the Minister of Commerce and Industry, Minister of State, and Vice Minister of Munitions in the war criminal Hideki Tojo's cabinet, assisting Hideki Tojo in launching the Pacific War of aggression against Asia. This war caused immeasurable disasters to the people of Asia and unprecedented disasters to the Japanese people.

War Criminal's Bloody Hands Not Yet Washed, Ascends to the Premiership Again
After Japan surrendered, Kishi Nobusuke and Hideki Tojo were imprisoned in Sugamo Prison as the first batch of Class A war criminals. However, U.S. imperialism took a fancy to this war criminal and released him soon after. In order to realize their conspiracy to accelerate the revival of Japanese militarism to serve their interests, U.S. imperialism and Japanese monopoly capital put Kishi Nobusuke, whose bloody hands were not yet washed, on the stage in February 1957 to serve as Prime Minister. After Kishi Nobusuke came to power, he pursued the most reactionary policies, making his cabinet the most reactionary cabinet in Japan after the war.

Disregarding National Interests, Sells Out to the United States
First of all, Kishi Nobusuke disregarded the Japanese people's demands for independence and peace, sold out national interests, and served the U.S. aggression and war policy. Kishi Nobusuke assured the United States of "eternal U.S.-Japan cooperation," and by signing the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, incorporated Japan's politics, economy, and military into the U.S. strategic system, further turning Japan into a U.S. atomic war base and Asia's main aggressive accomplice, blocking the path of Japan's peaceful development.

According to this aggressive policy of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries, Kishi Nobusuke frantically antagonized China, obstructed friendly exchanges between the peoples of Japan and China, tore up the Japan-China trade agreement, insulted the Chinese national flag, participated in the conspiracy to create "two Chinas," and supported the Chiang Kai-shek clique's "counterattack against the mainland," causing Japan-China relations to fall into a state of severance and still legally in a state of war. Kishi Nobusuke's reactionary policy not only violates the Japanese people's desire to restore diplomatic relations between Japan and China and develop economic and cultural exchanges between Japan and China, but also has caused serious adverse consequences for Japan in politics and economics.

Actively Expanding Armaments, Reviving Militarism
Second, Kishi Nobusuke has been more actively expanding armaments and reviving Japanese militarism than previous cabinets. Now, the military strength of Japanese militarism has exceeded that before the war. The Kishi Nobusuke government has also formulated a second long-term arms expansion plan, stepped up the implementation of nuclear armaments, and further expanded its military strength as a shield for U.S. aggression and Japanese militarist aggression policies. The degree of economic militarization in Japan is deepening, and the people's military expenditure burden is becoming heavier. According to the Kishi Nobusuke government's plan, by 1965, Japan's military expenditure will increase from more than 140 billion yen this year to 500 billion yen, and the average Japanese person will have to pay 5,500 yen for arms expansion and war preparation.

Pursuing Expansionist Policies, Reliving Old Dreams of Aggression
Third, relying on the United States to pursue expansionist policies, attempting to relive the old dream of the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." The Kishi Nobusuke cabinet formulated the "Southeast Asia Development Plan," using a large amount of tax money squeezed from the people as economic aggression funds for monopoly capital, and expanded to Southeast Asia, Latin America, and Africa through loans, shareholding, technical "cooperation," and other methods. In order to realize the imperialist aggressive ambitions of Japanese monopoly capital, Kishi Nobusuke wholeheartedly succumbed to the United States, not hesitating to sell out Japanese sovereignty, and willingly let the Japanese people serve as cannon fodder for U.S. wars of aggression, in exchange for U.S. support and "aid."

Suppressing the Democratic Movement, Strengthening Violent Rule
Fourth, Kishi Nobusuke frantically suppressed the democratic movement, deprived the Japanese people of some democratic rights they had gained through arduous struggles in the fifteen years after the war, and strengthened fascist rule. After Kishi Nobusuke came to power, he launched the most vicious attacks on the Communist Party and used fascist violence such as the police to carry out countless bloody suppressions of the working class's struggle. Kishi Nobusuke is restoring reactionary cultural and educational policies. He changed the education committee to an appointment system, implemented a textbook review system, restored the "moral education" that instilled militarist ideas, and implemented a fascist "performance evaluation" system for teachers. Kishi Nobusuke has also repeatedly attempted to have the Diet pass amendments to the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law" and formulate fascist laws such as the "Anti-Espionage Law," "Military Secrets Protection Law," and "Anti-Democratic Activities Suppression Law" to turn Japan into a complete police state. Kishi Nobusuke also attempted to amend the "Election Law" in order to seize more than two-thirds of the seats in the Diet and realize the criminal conspiracy to amend the constitution that prohibits Japan from waging war, so as to "legalize" future actions of Japanese militarists sending troops abroad and carrying out aggression.

Kishi Nobusuke's policies of betrayal, reaction, and aggression have caused deep disasters to the Japanese people, putting the vast majority of Japanese working people in dire straits. After the Kishi Nobusuke clique forcibly "passed" the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" in the House of Representatives, millions of Japanese people gathered and demonstrated in various places, issuing roars that shook the mountains and rivers: "Smash the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty!" "Down with the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet!" They can no longer tolerate Kishi Nobusuke, the representative of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries, continuing to control the fate of the country and pushing Japan into the abyss of aggressive war and the fascist system.

### 美帝国主义的走狗　日本人民的公敌  卖国贼岸信介罪大恶极

    美帝国主义的走狗　日本人民的公敌
    卖国贼岸信介罪大恶极
    岸信介不顾日本人民的坚决反对，施用法西斯暴力强使众议院非法“通过”日美军事同盟条约的横暴行为，更加彻底地暴露了岸信介的军国主义者的本来面目，又一次表明他是美帝国主义的走狗，是日本人民的公敌。
    充当东条帮凶　发动侵略战争
    岸信介以反共、反人民起家，是参与发动侵略战争的甲级战犯。他在东京帝国大学念书的时候，就从事迫害进步学生的罪恶活动。他的同学日本社会党议员原彪曾经在“朝日新闻”上描绘他的面目说：“岸信介浑身充满了法西斯的臭味”。岸信介混入政界以后，竭力为大资本家效劳，并且很早就参加了日本军国主义侵略中国的罪行。他在伪“满洲国”曾任掌握经济全权的“产业部次长”和总揽机要的“总务厅次长”，和日本最富有侵略色彩的关东军阀东条英机等一起被称为操纵伪“满洲国”的“五虎”，做尽了压榨和残害中国人民的坏事。他还担任过东条英机战犯内阁的商工大臣、国务大臣、军需次官，协助东条英机发动了侵略亚洲的太平洋战争。这次战争使亚洲人民遭受了难以计量的祸害，也给日本人民造成空前未有的灾难。
    战犯血手未干　上台又任首相
    日本投降后，岸信介和东条英机等作为第一批甲级战犯被关进巢鸭监狱。但是，美帝国主义看中了这个战犯，不久就把他放出来。美帝国主义和日本垄断资本为了实现他们加速复活日本军国主义来为它们的利益效劳的阴谋，在1957年2月把血手未干的岸信介捧上台，担任首相。岸信介上台后推行了最反动的政策，从而他的内阁成为日本战后最反动的内阁。
    不顾民族利益　卖身投靠美国
    首先，岸信介不顾日本人民争取独立和和平的要求，出卖民族利益，为美国的侵略和战争政策服务。岸信介向美国保证“美日永恒合作”，通过签订日美军事同盟条约，把日本的政治、经济和军事纳入美国的战略体系，把日本进一步变成美国的原子战争基地和亚洲的主要侵略帮凶，堵塞日本和平发展的道路。
    根据美日反动派的这种侵略政策，岸信介疯狂地敌视中国，阻挠日中两国人民的友好往来，撕毁日中贸易协定，侮辱中国国旗，参与制造“两个中国”的阴谋，支持蒋介石集团“反攻大陆”，使日中关系陷于断绝局面，仍然在法律上处于战争状态。岸信介这种反动政策不仅违背日本人民要求恢复日中邦交、发展日中经济文化交流的愿望，而且给日本在政治、经济等方面造成了严重的不利后果。
    积极扩充军备　复活军国主义
    第二，岸信介比过去的内阁更加积极地扩充军备，复活了日本军国主义。现在，日本军国主义的军事力量已经超过战前。岸信介政府还制定了第二个长期扩军计划，加紧实行核武装，进一步扩充军事实力，作为美国的侵略炮灰和日本军国主义侵略政策的后盾。日本的经济军事化程度日益加深，人民的军费负担日益沉重。按照岸信介政府的计划，到1965年日本的军费将从今年的一千四百多亿日元增为五千亿日元，日本平均每人要为扩军备战付出五千五百日元。
    推行扩张政策　重温侵略旧梦
    第三，依靠美国推行扩张政策，企图重温“大东亚共荣圈”的旧梦。岸信介内阁制定了“东南亚开发计划”，把从人民身上压榨的大量税款用作垄断资本的经济侵略资金，通过贷款、持股、技术“合作”等各种办法向东南亚、拉丁美洲和非洲扩张。为了实现日本垄断资本的帝国主义侵略野心，岸信介死心塌地地屈从美国，不惜出卖日本主权，甘愿让日本人民充当美国侵略战争的炮灰，来换取美国的支持和“援助”。
    镇压民主运动　加强暴力统治
    第四，岸信介疯狂镇压民主运动，剥夺日本人民在战后十五年来经过艰苦斗争取得的一些民主权利，加强法西斯统治。岸信介上台后对共产党进行最恶毒的攻击并利用警察等法西斯暴力对工人阶级的斗争进行了无数次的血腥镇压。岸信介正在恢复反动的文教政策。他把教育委员会改为任命制、实行教科书审定制度，恢复灌输军国主义思想的“道德教育”，对教员实行法西斯的“勤务评定”制度等。岸信介还一再企图使国会通过“警察官职务执行法”修改案，并制定“防谍法”、“军机保护法”、“反民主主义活动取缔法”等法西斯法律，把日本变成十足的警察国家。岸信介还企图修改“选举法”，以便攫取国会的三分之二以上的议席，实现修改禁止日本进行战争的宪法的罪恶阴谋，使以后日本军国主义派兵出国、进行侵略的行动“合法化”。
    岸信介的这些卖国的、反动的、侵略的政策，已经给日本人民造成了深重的灾难，使得日本广大劳动人民处于水深火热之中。在岸信介集团强行在众议院“通过”新日美“安全条约”以后，日本千百万群众在各地纷纷集会、示威，发出了震撼山河的怒吼：“粉碎日美安全条约！”“打倒岸信介内阁！”他们再也不能容忍美日反动派的代表岸信介继续掌握国家命运，把日本推向侵略战争和法西斯制度的深渊了。　（新华社）
