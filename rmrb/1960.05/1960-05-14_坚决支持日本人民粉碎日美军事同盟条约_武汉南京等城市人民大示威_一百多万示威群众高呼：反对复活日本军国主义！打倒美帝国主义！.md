Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Wuhan, Nanjing, Lanzhou, and Kunming, a total of more than 1.3 million people from all walks of life, held large-scale rallies and demonstrations on the 12th and 13th to resolutely support the Japanese people's just struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and resolutely oppose the heinous conspiracy of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries to plot a new war.

　　Yesterday, in Wuhan, over 700,000 people held large-scale rallies and demonstrations separately in the three towns. The central venue for the rally was the Wuhan Sports Center. The angry slogans of the demonstrators shook the entire stadium. Liao Chengzhi, member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman of the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity, and Wang Renzhong, First Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, attended the rally. Foreign guests from Japan, Cuba, Brazil, Argentina, Peru, Iran, Iraq, and other countries who were visiting Wuhan also attended the rally. Zeng Dun, member of the Standing Committee of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, pointed out in his speech at the rally: The Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty is a struggle that concerns the fate of 90 million Japanese people. As long as the Japanese people, with the strong support of the people of the world, carry the struggle through to the end, they will surely drive U.S. imperialism out of Japan! The rally participants warmly welcomed the speeches by Masuzo Akatsu, head of the delegation of the Japan-China Friendship Association, and Shinji Hagiwara, head of the delegation of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan. Akatsu said that although the future of the Japanese people's struggle will go through tortuous roads, under the situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind, if they persevere to the end, Nobusuke Kishi will surely suffer the same fate as Syngman Rhee, and victory belongs to the Japanese people. After the rally, the demonstrators marched in a mighty procession from the central venue and dozens of assembly points to the streets and alleys of the three towns of Wuhan. The people of Wuhan will never forget the towering crimes of rape, arson, and murder committed by Japanese militarism during its occupation of Wuhan. More than 700,000 angry people, carrying cartoons and banners, waving flags, shouted slogans such as "Oppose the revival of Japanese militarism!" "The people of China and Japan unite to overthrow U.S. imperialism!"

　　When Japanese imperialism occupied Nanjing at the end of 1937, the Japanese fascist army carried out a brutal massacre of Nanjing residents, killing more than 300,000 people. The people of Nanjing, who have a sea of ​​blood feud with Japanese fascism, held a city-wide demonstration on the 13th. The New Street Entrance Square in the city center was crowded with angry people, holding countless banners, waving their fists, and shouting slogans such as "Oppose the revival of Japanese militarism!" "The people of China and Japan unite to overthrow U.S. imperialism!" The members of the Zijinshan People's Commune in the suburbs, standing in the peasant ranks on the east side of the square, will never forget the heinous crimes committed by the U.S.-Japan aggressors in their hometown. Twenty-three years ago, in the winter, the brutal Japanese fascist army had engaged in a "killing contest" here on Zijin Mountain. Twelve years ago, in the summer, the American bandits also drowned three young peasants innocently here, creating the famous "Zhonghe Bridge" incident. When they heard that the U.S.-Japan reactionaries are now colluding to plot a new war, people's anger reached its peak. Mass rallies were also held in many other areas of Nanjing. A total of 400,000 people participated in the rallies and demonstrations throughout the city.

　　On the afternoon of the 12th, more than 200,000 people from all ethnic groups and all walks of life in Lanzhou, Gansu Province, held a large-scale rally and demonstration. The demonstration teams, carrying large cartoons and banners and shouting slogans, marched mightily towards the Central Square. Chen Baofu, a former volunteer soldier who had severely beaten the American bandits on the Korean battlefield, stood at the forefront of the militia ranks and kept shouting slogans with other militiamen. He said: "U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of peace-loving people all over the world. During the Korean War, I personally witnessed the towering crimes of the American bandits massacring the Korean people. Today, it is trying to revive Japanese militarism. We believe that the Japanese people will surely be able to drive U.S. imperialism out of Japan!"

　　On the 12th, 70,000 people in Kunming held rallies and demonstrations. People flocked to the streets in groups to demonstrate. In the demonstration ranks, there were workers, peasants, members of urban people's communes, militiamen, and students from Kunming, as well as Dai workers from the Nujiang and Lancang rivers, Jingpo farmers from Gaoligong Mountain, and Tibetan herdsmen from the Diqing Plateau. On September 30, 1940, Japanese planes bombed Kunming, leaving many people without their relatives and homeless. Xin Huixian, a resident, had six of her seven family members killed in that bombing, and her own legs were amputated due to injuries. Speaking of this bloody feud, she said angrily: "The U.S. imperialism and Kishi Nobusuke signed a military alliance treaty, which is to allow Japanese militarism to come again and take away more people's parents, brothers, and I resolutely oppose it."

    坚决支持日本人民粉碎日美军事同盟条约 
    武汉南京等城市人民大示威
    一百多万示威群众高呼：反对复活日本军国主义！打倒美帝国主义！
    本报讯　据新华社消息：武汉、南京、兰州、昆明四个城市共一百三十多万各界人民，于12日和13日举行大规模集会和示威游行，坚决支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的正义斗争，坚决反对美日反动派策划新战争的罪恶阴谋。
    武汉三镇昨天有七十多万人分别举行大规模的集会和示威游行。大会的中心会场是武汉体育场。示威群众愤怒的口号声震撼着全场。中共中央委员、中国亚非团结委员会主席廖承志和中共湖北省委第一书记王任重等参加了大会。参加大会的还有正在武汉访问的日本、古巴、巴西、阿根廷、秘鲁、伊朗、伊拉克等国的外宾。中共湖北省委常委、和大湖北省分会主席曾惇在大会的讲话指出：日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争是关系九千万日本人民命运的斗争，只要日本人民在全世界人民的坚强支持下，把斗争进行到底，就一定能把美帝国主义赶出日本去！集会群众热烈欢迎日中友协代表团团长赤津益造、日本工会总评议会代表团团长萩原信治的讲话。赤津益造说，日本人民的斗争前途，尽管要经历曲折的道路，但是，在东风压倒西风的形势下，坚持到底，岸信介必将遭到和李承晚一样的命运，胜利是属于日本人民的。大会结束后，示威群众从中心会场和几十个集会场所，浩浩荡荡地走向武汉三镇的大街小巷进行了倾城大示威。武汉人民永远也忘不了日本军国主义侵占武汉期间犯下的奸淫烧杀的滔天罪行。七十多万愤怒的群众，抬着漫画和标语牌，挥动旗帜，高呼“反对复活日本军国主义！”“中日两国人民团结起来，打倒美帝国主义！”等口号。
    1937年底日本帝国主义侵占南京时，日本法西斯军队对南京居民进行了灭绝人性的大屠杀，遭杀害的在三十万人以上。对日本法西斯有着血海深仇的南京市人民，13日举行了倾城大示威。在市中心的新街口广场上挤满了愤怒的群众，人们举着数不清的标语，挥舞着拳头高呼“反对复活日本军国主义！”“中日两国人民团结起来，打倒美帝国主义！”等口号。站在广场东面农民队伍里的郊区紫金山人民公社的社员们，对日美侵略者在他们的家乡犯下的滔天罪行是永远不会忘记的。二十三年前的冬天，惨无人道的日本法西斯军队曾在这里的紫金山上干过“杀人比赛”。十二年前的夏天，美国强盗也曾在这里无辜淹死了三个青年农民，制造了有名的“中和桥”事件。当他们听到美日反动派现在又勾结起来阴谋发动新的战争时，人们的愤怒情绪达到了极点。南京市的其他许多地区也举行了群众大会。全市参加集会和示威的共四十万人。
    甘肃省兰州市各族各界二十多万人12日下午举行了大规模的集会和示威游行。示威队伍抬着大幅漫画和标语牌，高呼着口号，浩浩荡荡地向中央广场汇集。曾经在朝鲜战场上痛击过美国强盗的原志愿军战士陈保福，站在民兵队伍的最前面，和其他民兵一起不断地高呼口号。他说：“美帝国主义是全世界爱好和平人民的最凶恶的敌人。在朝鲜战争期间，我亲眼看到过美国强盗屠杀朝鲜人民的滔天罪行，今天它又妄想复活日本军国主义，我们相信日本人民一定能够把美帝国主义从日本赶出去！”
    昆明市12日有七万人举行集会和示威游行。人们成群结队地涌向街头游行示威。在示威的行列里，有昆明市的工人、农民、城市人民公社的社员、民兵和学生，还有来自怒江、澜沧江边的傣族工人、高黎贡山的景颇族农民、迪庆高原上的藏族牧民。1940年9月30日，日寇飞机轰炸昆明，有许多人失去亲人，无家可归。居民辛惠仙一家七口人，有六口人在那次轰炸中被炸死，她自己的两条腿也因受伤被全部锯掉。提起这血海深仇，她愤怒地说：“美帝国主义同岸信介签订军事同盟条约，就是要日本军国主义再来夺去更多人的父母兄弟，我坚决反对。”
