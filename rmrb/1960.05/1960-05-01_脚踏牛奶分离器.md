    Foot-Operated Milk Separator

    The Qumalai County in the Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Qinghai Province has created an economical, practical, and easily manufactured foot-operated milk separator.

    For many years, herdsmen have been using heavy wooden sticks to churn butter, which is not only inefficient but also requires a great deal of labor. It takes three to four thousand strokes with a wooden stick to churn butter from a bucket of milk. With the foot-operated milk separator, work efficiency can be increased by fifteen times.

    脚踏牛奶分离器
    青海玉树藏族自治州曲麻莱县创造出一种经济适用、制造简便的脚踏牛奶分离器。
    多少年来，牧民打酥油都是用笨重的木棍，不仅效率低，劳动强度还很高，一桶牛奶需要用木棍打三、四千下，才能打成酥油。有了脚踏牛奶分离器，工作效率可提高十五倍。
