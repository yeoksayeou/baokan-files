　　This newspaper Zhengzhou, 3rd. Henan Province has sown more than 12 million mu of cotton as of recently, and the sowing work is still continuing. In Xinxiang Prefecture, more than 97% of the 1.5 million mu of cotton that has been sown has achieved full seedling emergence.

　　During the sowing process, various regions have fully utilized the superiority of the People's Communes, organizing large-scale campaigns for concentrated efforts. Commune members in Sui County were organized into specialized teams for soaking seeds, sowing, and acceptance inspection. They adopted methods such as prioritizing high-yield plots, then general fields, planting shallowly when the soil moisture is high, and deeply when the soil moisture is low. This allowed them to complete the sowing of 180,000 mu of cotton fifteen days earlier than last year, and the quality was also greatly improved compared to last year. The 1,900-plus specialized teams in Qingfeng County also successfully completed the sowing of 210,000 mu of cotton after seven days of concentrated effort and five days of final touches, and all of it was planted on high ridges.

　　People's Communes in drought-stricken and water-deficient areas have launched movements to combat drought and seize the opportunity for planting.

　　Currently, areas that have finished cotton sowing have shifted to activities such as checking seedlings and replanting. Yongcheng County, under the slogan of "Replant every missing seedling," mobilized more than 1,400 laborers and replanted all 37,000-plus mu of cotton fields with missing seedlings. Many communes also cultivated reserve cotton seedlings in preparation for transplanting them into cotton fields with missing seedlings or broken ridges.

　　This newspaper Jinan dispatch, Shandong's drought-resistant cotton sowing is basically completed, and seedling stage management is fully underway. Shandong has overcome drought, and cotton sowing has ended successively. As of the 25th, more than 9,620,000 mu have been sown, accounting for 90.4% of the province's sowing plan. Various regions, in the spirit of "linking each link tightly and taking the initiative in every step," have fully launched a campaign to check seedlings, replant, and protect seedlings.

　　Shandong's cotton sowing is earlier, faster, and of better quality than any other year. The characteristics of this year's cotton planting are: (1) Concentrated and contiguous areas, establishing large areas of high-yield plots. Over 80% of the cotton fields in the province have achieved garden-style management and water conservancy, establishing 5,930,000 mu of large areas of high-yield fields. (2) Achieving improved varieties, and more than 90% have achieved drug-mixed seed smothering, generally achieving warm water seed soaking. (3) Sufficient base fertilizer has been universally applied, generally around 5,000 jin for general fields, around 8,000 jin for high-yield fields, and up to 30,000 jin for higher ones. (4) Rational close planting has been achieved, with a sowing amount of 18 to 20 jin per mu. (5) Improved cotton planting technology, determining row spacing according to soil quality, fertility, and lean, wide and narrow row planting, unified specifications. Many high-yield fields have also implemented nutrient pot seedling cultivation, which lays the foundation for striving for a bumper cotton harvest in 1960.

　　This newspaper, Xi'an, 3rd. Shaanxi Province is vigorously grasping the final stages of cotton sowing, organizing the broad masses of cadres and people to go deep into the fields and carry out a large-scale inspection and replanting movement to check area, check quality, check germination, and check seedling emergence, so that the cotton field sowing area is repeatedly expanded and the sowing quality is repeatedly improved.

　　As of April 24, the province had already sown more than 4 million mu of cotton, accounting for more than 94% of the pre-reserved main-crop cotton field area. People in parts of northern Shaanxi and other areas with later sowing seasons are still actively sowing.

　　The mass inspection and replanting movement has promoted the repeated expansion of the cotton field sowing area. In the main cotton-producing area of Weinan County's Gushi People's Commune, due to the expansion of the area of grain crops, the planned sowing of more than 170,000 mu of cotton this year originally only involved sowing more than 110,000 mu of main-crop cotton, with the remainder to be replanted after the summer harvest. Cadres and the masses went deep into the fields for large-scale inspection and replanting, and discovered that many scattered plots of land could be used. They immediately launched a movement to search for land and rotate crops, planting oil crops, vegetables, and other crops on the scattered plots of land found along ditches, roadsides, and house sides, freeing up whole plots of land for cotton planting, and re-implementing rational crop rotation for various crops, changing some early autumn crops to late autumn crops. As a result, the entire commune planted more than 63,000 mu of main-crop cotton, exceeding the original planned area with main-crop cotton fields alone. This year, the province is striving to reach 4.6 million mu of cotton field sowing area.

　　Through the large-scale inspection and replanting movement, the quality of cotton sowing has also been further improved. Weinan, Dali, Pucheng and other counties in the eastern part of Guanzhong, where sowing began earlier, have universally organized specialized personnel to inspect cotton germination and seedling emergence, adopting the method of checking and replanting before cotton seedling emergence to overcome the phenomenon of uneven and weak cotton seedlings caused by late replanting in previous years.

　　This newspaper Nanchang, 3rd. Jiangxi has overcome the continuous rain and cold snap attacks, and has sown 1.4 million mu of cotton, with another 400,000 mu being sown urgently.

　　Jiangxi Province, which has historically planted less cotton due to soil and climate conditions, has increased 200,000 mu of new cotton fields this year under the guidance of the idea of taking grain as the key link and developing in an all-round way. In order to complete the cotton sowing task in a timely manner, Party committees at all levels, based on the unfavorable conditions of continuous spring rains and cold snaps, implemented three concentrations of leadership, labor, and farming cattle and implements, and adopted the method of large-scale campaigns for concentrated efforts, seizing sunny days and rushing to sow. Various regions have also adopted methods such as having experienced farmers lead new farmers and running short-term training classes to train a large number of cotton planting experts, and have vigorously engaged in cotton planting tool reform, creating and transforming a large number of highly efficient new tools.

　　In order to ensure the completion and over-completion of this year's cotton production task, various cotton-growing areas in the province have launched a high-yield movement centered on field management after basically completing the sowing task, carrying out seedling inspection and replanting, thinning, and setting seedlings. Some areas where sowing started earlier have already begun cultivating and weeding cotton fields, preventing insects, and applying fertilizer.

　　This newspaper, Taiyuan, 3rd. People's communes in cotton-producing areas of Shanxi Province actively reform cotton field sowing techniques, do everything possible to combat drought and sow, and strive for full and vigorous seedlings. At present, more than 3.2 million mu of cotton fields in the province have been sown, with sowing time advanced by five to ten days compared with previous years, and sowing quality greatly exceeding previous years.

　　Shanxi generally had little rain last winter and this spring, and members of the People's Communes in various cotton-producing areas actively carried out drought-resistant moisture conservation sowing. The People's Communes in Yicheng County promptly organized more than 570 cotton planting experts to visit, learn, and promote the set of advanced experiences in drought-resistant sowing created by Wu Chun'an, a nationally renowned cotton planting model. The county completed planting all 131,400 mu of cotton fields in ten days.

　　In terms of sowing technology, various regions have universally implemented timely early planting, north-south row planting, wide and narrow row planting, and rational close planting. In Jinan, the largest cotton-producing area in the province, 90% of the 1.5 million mu of cotton fields that have been planted have implemented north-south row planting, with even and reasonable seed dispersal; more than 80% of the paddy fields have implemented wide and narrow row planting; the row spacing of dry and lean land has been reduced from the previous one foot five or six inches to one foot two inches.

　　This newspaper Urumqi dispatch, 3rd. The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps' sixty-plus military reclamation cotton-growing farms are sowing cotton twice as fast as in the same period last year. The corps plans to sow 1 million mu of cotton, which is also more than 440,000 mu larger than last year.

　　Vigorously reforming cotton planting machinery and giving full play to the power of various cotton planting machinery are the main measures for the Production and Construction Corps to complete the cotton sowing plan this year. According to past experience, the early spring climate in Xinjiang is fickle, and sowing must be completed during the most suitable sowing period to ensure normal cotton development and win a bumper cotton harvest. In order to achieve timely sowing, the farms vigorously reformed cotton planting machinery and grasped the matching of cotton planting machinery before sowing, which greatly exerted the tillage efficiency of various machinery and accelerated the sowing speed.

　　In order to further accelerate the sowing speed and improve the sowing quality, the farms have also universally added lighting equipment to tractors and promoted a three-shift cultivation system, tilling the land at night to preserve moisture and rushing to sow during the day, so that many tractors can complete more than one to two times the quota of daily work, and there have been many high-record tractor groups that sow more than 1,000 mu of cotton per day. As of April 28, the entire corps had sown more than 280,000 mu of cotton, which is more than twice as fast as in the same period last year. All farms have universally promoted horizontal seedling removal and implemented square hole planting, making the middle tillage management of cotton fields more convenient for the use of machinery, reducing manpower, and improving the quality of middle tillage.

    豫鲁陕赣狠抓种棉收尾工作
    山西抗旱播种三百万亩棉花力争苗全苗壮
    新疆六十多个军垦农场种棉比去年快一倍
    本报郑州3日电　河南省到最近为止已播种棉花一千二百多万亩，播种工作还在继续进行。新乡专区已播种的一百五十多万亩棉花，达到全苗的占97％以上。
    在播种中，各地充分发挥人民公社的优越性，组织大兵团作战，突击进行。睢县参加棉花播种的社员，分别组成了浸种、播种、验收等专业队，采取先丰产方、后一般田，墒大种浅，墒小种深等办法，比去年提前十五天完成了十八万亩的棉花播种任务，质量也大大超过去年。清丰县的一千九百多个专业队，经过七天突击，五天扫尾，也顺利完成了二十一万亩的棉花播种任务，并且全部实现了高垅种植。
    处在干旱缺墒地区各人民公社，都开展了抗旱抢种运动。
    目前，已经结束棉花播种的地区已转入查苗补苗活动。永城县在“缺一棵、补一棵”的口号下，出动一千四百多名劳力，已将三万七千多亩缺苗棉田全部补齐。许多公社还培育了棉花预备苗，准备往缺苗断垅的棉田里移栽。
    本报济南电　山东抗旱播种棉花基本结束，苗期管理全面展开，山东各地战胜干旱，棉花播种陆续结束，到25日止，已播种九百六十二万多亩，占省播种计划90.4％。各地本着“环环扣紧，步步主动”的精神，全面展开了查苗补苗保苗运动。
    山东棉花播种早，进度快，质量好是任何一年所没有的。今年植棉的特点是：（1）集中连片，建立了大面积丰产方，全省80％以上的棉田实现了园田化和水利化，建立了大面积丰产田五百九十三万亩。（2）实现了良种化，并且有90％以上做到了药剂拌闷种，一般都做到了温汤浸种。（3）普遍施足了底肥，一般田五千斤左右，丰产田八千斤左右，高者达三万斤。（4）实现了合理密植，每亩施种量均在18至20斤；（5）改进了植棉技术，根据土质肥、瘦定行距，宽窄行种植，规格统一。不少的丰产田还实行营养钵育苗，这为争取1960年棉花大丰收打下基础。
    本报西安3日电　陕西省大抓棉花播种收尾工作，组织广大干部、群众深入田间，开展查面积、查质量、查发芽、查出苗的大查大补运动，使棉田播种面积一再扩大，播种质量一再提高。
    截至4月24日，全省已经播种棉花四百多万亩，占预留正茬棉田面积的94％以上。陕北等部分播种季节较迟地区的群众，还在积极播种。
    群众性的大查大补运动，促进棉田播种面积一再扩大。主要产棉区的渭南县固市人民公社，由于粮食作物面积扩大，今年计划播种的十七万多亩棉花，原来仅播种正茬棉花十一万多亩，其余都等夏收作物收获后进行复种。干部和群众深入田间大查大补，发现有许多零星土地可以利用，立即开展了搜地倒茬运动，把寻找出来的渠边、路边、宅边零星土地种植油料、蔬菜等作物，腾出整块地种棉花，并重新对各种作物进行合理倒茬，把一部分早秋作物改为晚秋作物。结果全公社又种了六万三千多亩正茬棉花，仅正茬棉田就超额完成了原计划面积。今年全省的棉田播种面积争取达到四百六十万亩。
    经过大查大补运动，棉花的播种质量也更加提高了。播种较早的关中东部地区的渭南、大荔、蒲城等县，已经普遍组织了检查棉花发芽和出苗情况的专业人员，采取棉花出苗前就进行查补的办法，克服往年由于补栽迟而发生棉苗不齐不壮的现象。
    本报南昌3日电　江西各地战胜连绵阴雨和寒潮的侵袭，已经播种棉花一百四十万亩，还有四十万亩正在加紧播种。
    历来因土质和气候等条件限制种植棉花较少的江西省，今年在以粮为纲、全面发展的思想指导下，通过合理安排，增加了二十万亩新棉田。为了及时完成棉花播种任务，各级党委都根据春雨连绵、寒潮侵袭的不利情况，实行领导、劳力、耕牛农具三集中，采用大兵团突击作战的办法，抓住晴天，突击播种。各地还采取以老带新和开办短期训练班等办法，培训大批植棉能手，又大搞植棉工具改革，创制和改造了大量工效很高的新工具。
    为了保证完成和超额完成今年棉花生产任务，全省各植棉区在基本完成播种任务后，已经开展了以田间管理为中心的丰产运动，进行查苗补苗和间苗、定苗工作。有些播种较早的地区，已开始给棉田中耕锄草、防虫和施肥料。
    本报太原3日电　山西省各产棉区人民公社积极改革棉田播种技术，千方百计抗旱播种，力争苗全苗旺。目前，全省已有三百二十多万亩棉田下种，播种时间比往年提前五天到十天，播种质量大大超过了往年。
    去冬今春山西普遍少雨，各产棉区人民公社社员积极进行抗旱保墒播种。翼城县各人民公社及时组织五百七十多名植棉能手，参观学习和推广全国著名植棉模范吴春安创造的一套抗旱播种的先进经验，全县十天之内就把十三万一千四百亩棉田全部种完。
    在播种技术方面，各地普遍实行了适时早种、南北行种植、宽窄行种植和合理密植。全省最大的产棉区，晋南地区已种的一百五十万亩棉田，有90％实行了南北行种植，撒籽均匀合理；有80％以上的水地实行了宽窄行种植；旱薄地的行距，都由过去的一尺五、六寸缩小到一尺二寸。
    本报乌鲁木齐3日电　新疆生产建设兵团六十多个军垦植棉农场播种棉花速度比去年同期快一倍以上。这个兵团计划播种棉花一百万亩，也比去年扩大四十四万多亩。
    大力改革植棉机具，充分发挥各种植棉机具的威力，是生产建设兵团今年完成棉花播种计划的主要措施。根据往年的经验，新疆早春气候变化无常，必须争取在最适宜的播种期播种完毕，才能保证棉花的正常发育，夺取棉花丰收。为了做到适时播种，各农场在播种前就大力改革植棉机具，大抓棉花播种机具配套，这样，就大大发挥了各种机具的耕作效率，加快了播种速度。
    为了进一步加快播种速度，提高播种质量，各农场还普遍在拖拉机上增加了照明设备，并且推行三班耕作制度，晚上整地保墒，白天突击播种，这样就使很多拖拉机每日完成的工作量，超过定额的一倍到两倍以上，并且出现了不少日播一千多亩棉花的高纪录拖拉机组。到4月28日止，全兵团已经播种棉花二十八万多亩，速度比去年同期快一倍以上。各农场由于全面推行横向铲苗，实行方形穴植，使棉田的中耕管理更便于使用机械，减少人力，并提高中耕质量。
