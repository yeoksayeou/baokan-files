Xinhua News Agency, 29th dispatch from Tokyo: The massive national struggle of the Japanese people against Eisenhower's visit to Japan has greatly shocked the Japanese and American reactionaries.

According to a report this morning by Kyushu Asahi Broadcasting Corporation Radio, Japanese police authorities are concerned about Eisenhower's visit to Japan under the current circumstances. They believe that "in the current atmosphere, even if police forces are mobilized, it cannot be guaranteed that accidents will not occur."

The radio station said that the National Police Agency is currently studying the "security plan" for President Eisenhower's visit to Japan, but "more and more people hold the opinion that the strength of the opposition to the new security treaty should not be underestimated, especially after the (Liberal Democratic Party) forcibly passed the (new "security treaty") single-handedly on the 19th." The police authorities are worried that, especially on the stretch of road where Eisenhower travels by car from Haneda Airport to the Imperial Palace, the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and the National Council to Prevent Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" will hold large-scale demonstrations, possibly angrily "surging towards the car carrying His Majesty the Emperor and President Eisenhower."

The radio station also reported that a "New York Times" reporter believes that Eisenhower's visit to Japan under the current circumstances "is not a good strategy for the United States."

    美国总统未成行　日本当局先心惊
    担心动员警察也难阻止人民反对艾森豪威尔访日
    新华社29日讯　东京消息：日本人民反对艾森豪威尔访日的声势浩大的全国性斗争，已经使日美反动派大为震惊。
    据九州朝日广播公司电台今晨报道，日本警察当局对艾森豪威尔在目前情况下访问日本表示担心。它认为，“在目前的气氛中，尽管动员警察力量，也不能保证绝对不会发生事故”。
    这家电台说，警察厅目前正在研究艾森豪威尔总统访日期间的“警备计划”，但是，“持有这样意见的人越来越多，即不应该过低估计反对新安全条约的力量，尤其是在19日（自由民主党）单独强行表决
  （新“安全条约”）以后”。警察当局担心，特别在艾森豪威尔坐汽车从羽田机场到皇宫这一段路程上，社会党、共产党、阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议等将举行大规模的示威，可能愤怒地“拥往天皇陛下和艾森豪威尔总统所坐的车子”。
    这家电台还报道，“纽约时报”的记者认为艾森豪威尔在目前情况下访日，“对美国来说不是上策”。
