Turkey Under the Reactionary Rule of Menderes

Since coming to power in May 1950, the Turkish Menderes government has increasingly tied Turkey to the American war chariot over the past decade, turning Turkey into a semi-colony. Domestically, it has implemented an extremely brutal fascist rule, plunging the people into misery. Menderes' domestic and foreign policies, which harmed the interests of the Turkish people, have aroused increasingly fierce opposition from the broad masses of the Turkish people.

Since taking office, the Menderes government has joined the imperialist aggressive bloc - the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Baghdad Pact Organization, later renamed the Central Treaty Organization, accepted the "Eisenhower Doctrine," and signed bilateral military agreements with the United States, effectively turning Turkish territory into a large American military base. There are more than 110 American air force bases, 10 naval and land bases, and countless small radar stations throughout the country. Currently, the establishment of American rocket launch sites in Turkey is being accelerated, and atomic weapons are being shipped in. The Turkish army has effectively become a mercenary of the United States, completely under American control. Most of the military expenses are provided by the United States, and American military personnel have penetrated into the grassroots level of the Turkish army. Under American orders, the Turkish army participated in the American-launched war of aggression against Korea, acting as cannon fodder for the United States. It has also repeatedly played with fire for the United States, threatening the borders of Arab countries and carrying out subversive activities against Arab countries, which has been condemned by the people of the Arab world.

Due to following the United States in expanding its military and preparing for war, Turkey's economic situation has deteriorated, and the people's lives have become increasingly difficult. According to materials revealed by the Turkish opposition party, at least 24 million out of Turkey's 27 million people are experiencing economic difficulties. At the congress of the Turkish Wool and Carpet Workers' Union, a representative pointed out, "The livestock are now fed more than the workers earn."

What is even more intolerable for the Turkish people is that, in order to implement its traitorous policies, the Menderes government brutally suppresses the people's dissatisfaction and resistance, almost depriving the people of their basic democratic rights. It prohibits the activities of the Communist Party and all democratic organizations, and prohibits workers from striking. In 1954 and 1956, it forced the National Assembly to pass a series of reactionary laws depriving freedom of speech, such as the Press Restriction Law, the Amendment to the Press Law, and the Regulations for Press Employees. In 1957, it further restricted the press's right to report parliamentary news and the rights that members of parliament should enjoy in parliament. In November 1958, it formulated a law absolutely prohibiting any political gatherings, press conferences, and the publication of political statements.

In order to stifle the people's cries of discontent, the Menderes government particularly brutally suppressed freedom of speech. Many newspapers were closed down under absurd pretexts. Between 1950 and 1958 alone, more than 800 newspaper editors were thrown into prison. From January 15 to February 15, 1959, Menderes' "Special Press Court" tried nine cases of persecuting journalists. Even a sixteen-year-old boy was arrested simply for shouting "The newspaper says sugar is going to rise in price" while selling newspapers.

As the date of the National Assembly election approaches (originally scheduled for next year, but it is reported that the Menderes government, which is facing increasing condemnation, is worried that the later the election is held, the more unfavorable it will be for it, and is therefore planning to hold it earlier this year), the Menderes government is taking even more insane fascist measures to suppress the opposition party and the opposition of the broad masses of the people. In April, it made the National Assembly pass a resolution to establish a "Investigation Committee" with great power to "investigate" the activities of the opposition party and the attitude of pro-opposition newspapers. This committee also has the power to order the suspension of all political activities. Subsequently, this committee announced the suspension of political activities for three months. It was this new ban that ignited the accumulated resentment of the Turkish people for ten years, triggering large-scale demonstrations.

    曼德列斯反动统治下的土耳其
    土耳其曼德列斯政府自从1950年5月上台，十年以来，把土耳其越来越紧地绑在美国战车上，使土耳其沦为半殖民地，对内则实行极端残暴的法西斯统治，把人民推进水深火热之中。曼德列斯损害土耳其人民利益的对内对外政策激起土耳其广大人民越来越激烈的反对。
    曼德列斯政府执政以来，加入了帝国主义的侵略集团——北大西洋公约组织和后来改名为中央条约组织的巴格达条约组织，接受了“艾森豪威尔主义”，同美国签订了双边军事协定，实际上把土耳其国土变成美国的一个大军事基地。全国共有一百一十多个美国空军基地，十个海陆军基地，无数小雷达站，目前并正加紧在土耳其设立美国火箭发射场，运入原子武器。土耳其军队实际上变为美国的雇佣军，完全在美国控制之下，大部分军费由美国提供，美国军事人员深入到土耳其军队基层。在美国命令之下，土耳其军队曾经参加美国发动的侵朝战争，充当美国的炮灰。它还一再为美国火中取栗，陈兵威胁阿拉伯国家边境，对阿拉伯国家进行颠覆活动，受到阿拉伯世界人民的谴责。
    由于追随美国扩军备战，土耳其经济情况日益恶化，人民生活也愈益困苦。据土耳其反对党揭露的材料，在土耳其二千七百万人口中，至少有二千四百万人经受着经济困难。在土耳其羊毛和地毯工人工会代表大会上一位代表曾经指出，“现在喂牲畜的东西也比工人劳动所得的多”。
    更加使土耳其人民不可忍受的是，曼德列斯政府为了执行卖国政策，残暴镇压人民的不满和反抗，几乎剥夺了人民的起码的民主权利。它禁止共产党和一切民主组织活动，禁止工人罢工。1954年和1956年就强使国民议会通过新闻限制法、新闻法修正案和新闻从业员条例等一系列剥夺言论自由的反动法律。到了1957年更实行限制报界报道议会消息的权利，限制议员在议会中所应享有的权利，并在1958年11月制订了绝对禁止举行任何政治性集会、记者招待会和发表政治声明的法律。
    曼德列斯政府为了窒息人民的不满呼声，特别残暴地摧残言论自由。许多报纸在荒谬借口下被封闭，仅在1950年至1958年期间，就有八百多名报刊编辑被投进监狱；1959年1月15日至2月15日，曼德列斯的“特别新闻法庭”就审判了九起迫害新闻工作者的案件。甚至一个十六岁少年只是在卖报时喊“报纸说糖要涨价了”，也被逮捕了。
    随着国民议会选举日期的接近（原应在明年举行，但据报道，遭受越来越多谴责的曼德列斯政府担心选举越迟举行对它越不利，因而正计划提前在今年举行），曼德列斯政府正更加疯狂地采取法西斯手段，镇压反对党和广大人民的反对。它在4月间使国民议会通过成立一个权力极大的“调查委员会”，“调查”反对党的活动和亲反对党的报纸的态度，这个委员会并有权下令停止一切政治活动。接着，这个委员会就宣布停止政治活动三个月。也就是这个新的禁令，把土耳其人民十年来蕴积的愤恨情绪点燃起来，爆发了大示威。
