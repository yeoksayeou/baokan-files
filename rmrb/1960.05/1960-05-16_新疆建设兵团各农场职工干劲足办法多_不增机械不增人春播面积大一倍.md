Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps Farms: Workers are Highly Motivated and Have Many Methods
Spring Sowing Area Doubles Without Increasing Machinery or Personnel

    (Our report) The more than 130 military reclamation farms of the Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps are making significant changes to spring plowing machinery, farming methods, and cropping systems during spring plowing and sowing. They are fully tapping the potential of machinery, striving to complete the spring plowing and sowing tasks without increasing machinery or labor.

    This year, the spring sowing area of the farms has increased by nearly 100% compared to last year. The farms are not only refraining from increasing machinery and labor, but also plan to allocate 30% of the labor force and some machinery to continue reclaiming wasteland. This has made the labor force and sowing machinery particularly strained.

    To address these difficulties, the farms launched a technical innovation movement centered on reforming spring plowing machinery during the preparatory period. In just over a month, they created and modified 35 types of important machinery for sowing, tilling, and fertilizing. These machines not only save a significant amount of labor but also enable the mechanization and semi-mechanization of more than ten previously manual farming operations. Among them, the efficiency of 24 new machines is several times to dozens of times higher than manual operation.

    In the past, potato sowing required a large amount of labor. This year, the farms have mechanized the sowing work by creating potato planters. A potato planter that can simultaneously open ditches, sow, cultivate soil, and compact the soil increases efficiency 80 times compared to manual sowing. Farms in the Usu Reclamation Area, which have larger planting areas for cotton and corn, have converted cotton and corn row planters into spot planters this year. This can save half of the seeds and reduce the labor for seedling setting by more than two-thirds.

    This year, the farms are also making significant changes to farming methods, universally converting single-task tractor operations into combined operations, greatly speeding up the sowing process. Now, a tractor can carry three to five different agricultural implements at a time, with each implement carrying only two to three parts. These are connected as a whole, allowing four or five processes such as plowing, harrowing, sowing, ridging, and compacting to be completed in one go. This reduces the number of cultivation layers and shortens the distance between plowing and sowing, making one tractor do the work of two or three.

    Reforming the cropping system is one of the important measures taken by the Production and Construction Corps this year to strive to complete the spring plowing and sowing plan. The experience of the farms in recent years has proven that early spring crops can not only be sown over winter but also improve the disease resistance of the crops, allowing them to mature earlier and yield higher. Therefore, this year, the farms have advanced the sowing season for more than two million mu of spring-sown crops.

    To ensure the completion of the spring sowing plan with quality and quantity, the Party committees of the farms are closely monitoring the organization and leadership of machinery and labor. They are adopting a combination of large-scale concentration and small-scale dispersion, using the main mechanical power, labor force, and animal power to sow early spring crops. At the same time, they are sending machinery cadres at all levels down to the tractor teams to study and improve farming methods together with the tractor drivers. The repair factories and workshops of the farms have also organized field repair teams to go deep into the fields and repair machinery in a timely manner. The farms have also organized quality inspection teams, jointly formed by the mechanized farming teams and production teams, to inspect the quality of cultivation, ensuring that each plot is inspected and accepted after sowing.

    新疆建设兵团各农场职工干劲足办法多
    不增机械不增人春播面积大一倍
    本报讯　新疆军区生产建设兵团一百三十多个军垦农场在春耕春播中，大改春耕机具，大改耕作方法和耕作制度，充分挖掘机械潜力，力争在不增加机具和劳力的情况下，完成春耕播种任务。
    今年，各农场的春播面积比去年增加了将近一倍。各农场不仅不增加机具和劳力，并且还要抽出30％的劳力和部分机具继续开垦荒地。这样，就使劳力和播种的机具显得十分紧张。
    为了解决这方面的困难，各农场在备耕的同时就掀起了以改革春耕机具为中心的技术革新运动。在一个多月内，就创制和改制各种播种、整地、施肥等重要机具三十五种。这些机具不仅能节省大量劳力，而且使十多种原来靠手工操作的耕作项目实现了机械化和半机械化，其中有二十四种新机具的工效比人工操作提高几倍到几十倍。
    往年要投入大量劳力的马铃薯播种工作，今年各农场由于创制了马铃薯播种机，使播种工作实现了机械化。一架能同时开沟、播种、培土、镇压的马铃薯播种机，比人工播种提高工效八十倍。棉花和玉米播种面积较大的乌苏垦区各农场，今年将棉花和玉米条播机改为点播机，能节省一半种子，还能使定苗的人工减少三分之二以上。
    今年，各农场还大改耕作方法，把拖拉机单项作业普遍改为复式作业，大大加快了播种速度。现在一台拖拉机一次就带三种到五种不同的农具，每一种农具只带两件到三件，并且串连成一个整体，使耕、耙、播、筑埂、镇压等四、五道工序一次作完。这样就减少了耕作层次，缩短了从耕到播之间的距离，一台拖拉机顶两三台用。
    改革耕作制度是今年生产建设兵团争取完成春耕播种计划的重要措施之一。各农场近年来的经验证明，早春作物不仅可以越冬播种，而且可以提高作物的抗病能力，成熟早，产量高。因此，今年各农场有二百多万亩春播作物都提早了播种季节。
    为了保证按质按量地完成春播计划，各农场党委都抓紧机具和劳力的组织领导工作，采取大集中小分散相结合的办法，把主要的机力、劳力、畜力用来播种早春作物，同时将各级机务干部下放到拖拉机组内，和拖拉机手一起研究和改进耕作方法。各农场的修理厂和车间也组织田间修理小组，深入田间，及时检修机具。各农场还组织了质量检查组，由机耕队和生产队共同检查耕作质量，做到播一块检查一块验收一块。
