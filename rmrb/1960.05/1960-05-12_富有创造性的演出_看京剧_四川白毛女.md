    A Creative Performance
    ——Seeing the Peking Opera "Sichuan White-Haired Girl"
    Yan Changke
    "The old society turned people into ghosts, the new society turns ghosts back into people." We are already very familiar with the story of "The White-Haired Girl" Xi'er. This is legend, but it is also fact. The "White-Haired Girl" of Yibin, Sichuan, is also a historical witness. This White-Haired Girl, Luo Changxiu, is still alive today, happily working and living under the Party's kind care.

    Some time ago, in the modern-themed opera performance, the Peking Opera "Sichuan White-Haired Girl," performed by the Experimental Peking Opera Troupe of the China National Academy of Chinese Theatre Arts, was adapted from the Sichuan Opera "Sichuan White-Haired Girl" and the story of Luo Changxiu. He Changxiu (the Sichuan White-Haired Girl in the artistic work), the daughter of a poor peasant, has a similarly tragic experience to Xi'er; however, the content of the two plays does not feel repetitive.

    The story of this play takes place in the mountainous areas of Sichuan before liberation. The reactionary landlord class was even more lawless in this remote and closed-off place. People like He Xizhang, written in the play, local despots who dominate the area, truly commit all kinds of evil. He Xizhang is the "regimental chief" whose thugs follow him around. In the clan, their word is law when it comes to any right or wrong. They have money, guns, and the power of "ancestors." He Xizhang uses clan ties with He Changxiu's father, but when he turns his back, he is completely ruthless; the tortures he uses, such as hanging and "drowning in the pool," are precisely the characteristics of patriarchal rule. This kind of person kills, sets fires, and oppresses the villagers; their cruelty and barbarity have a particularly strong feudal nature. He Xizhang, in order to plot two acres of "Fish Dragon Land," "wants to move the ancestral grave there, so that every generation is guaranteed to produce two county magistrates," forcing He Changxiu's family to ruin. However, under this feudal oppression, the peasants' fighting spirit is also particularly strong. When He Changbao can no longer endure it, he sets fire to take revenge; He Changxiu is able to live strongly in the mountains for twelve years. Both demonstrate the indomitable fighting will of the working people. Although this play reflects the struggle against feudal landlords, it is a profound and vivid class education lesson for today's audiences, especially the younger generation.

    The play's performance is very moving. The scenes after He Changxiu is forced up the mountain are even more so. Years come and go, and life in the deep mountains is long and arduous. In order to survive, she has to climb mountains and ridges, gather wild fruits and roots, and fight for her life with tigers and wolves. What power is supporting her? It is class hatred, the determination for revenge, and the deep feelings for her suffering mother down the mountain. The scene of "Missing Her Family" concentrates on expressing this feeling. It uses a long section of Erhuang aria, absorbing the tunes of Bangzi and Gao Bozi, and integrating the singing styles of Laosheng and Hualian. The high-pitched, passionate, and profound singing fully vents Changxiu's deep feelings of love and hate, remembrance, and grief. The lyrics are also written vividly, with rich emotions, and the harmonious rhyme enhances the language's appeal. We are particularly moved by Changxiu, who, remembering her mother's difficult life down the mountain in the freezing wind, sends her a little firewood. When she sees that the land beside the house is also barren, she picks up a hoe and loosens the soil. The daughter misses her mother, but she thinks about her current appearance and situation: "Oh, mother, even if you are brave and strong, and you are not afraid or hide when you see your daughter, it will be more heartbreaking than not seeing her, and the separation will be even more devastating. If a bad person sees her, it will bring disaster to my mother." The mother also misses her daughter, but where can she find her in the vast mountains? Inside and outside the door, it is a short distance, yet it feels like the ends of the earth. Changxiu cries out the word "Mom," but has to swallow it back. Who has forced them to this point? Seeing this, I cannot help but think of the scene in the opera "The White-Haired Girl" where Yang Bailao braids Xi'er's hair. Both of these scenes depict the love between parents and children of the working people, but the situations are different. In "The White-Haired Girl," joy is filled with heartbreaking tears; here, there are no tears, no crying, but in sorrow, there is a strong accusation! Finally, the scene where the People's Liberation Army helps the mother and daughter reunite is also a moving scene.

    The Experimental Peking Opera Troupe of the China National Academy of Chinese Theatre Arts chose "Sichuan White-Haired Girl" as a creative theme, also intentionally exploring experience for Peking Opera to reflect real life. Judging from the performance, they have achieved certain success. The plot of the script is coherent, the contradictions develop quickly, and the minor scenes are written concisely and briskly, but when it comes to the peak of the conflict, it can concentrate on the ink and give full play to the characteristics of Peking Opera's singing, acting, reciting, and fighting, providing a solid foundation for the performance. Like the scenes of "Missing Family," "Sending Firewood," and "Meeting" mentioned earlier. This makes the characterization more vivid, and the theme is also expressed more prominently. In terms of directing and performance, there are many creative attempts to resolve the contradiction between new content and traditional forms. The image shaping uses the original roles, but there are bold breakthroughs. The actors' recitations learn from the characteristics of "rhyme recitation" and "Peking recitation" in the tradition, refining and poeticizing the everyday language. The emphasis on pronunciation and rhyme is all for better expressing the characters and emotions. The traditional performance routines are also boldly adopted, but the rigid application and the accumulation of techniques are avoided.

    The entire performance of the play is very neat. It can be seen that the actors have a strong sense of collectivism, but each actor has an outstanding creation. This shows the vigorous spirit of this young troupe. Their performances of "The Legend of the White Snake," "Felling Zidu," and other plays have won praise from audiences across the country; this performance of "Sichuan White-Haired Girl" is an important step forward on the road of creating modern plays, and the achievement is even more valuable. Because of it, it once again powerfully proves that Peking Opera can not only fully express modern themes, but also has broader prospects than some local operas.

### 富有创造性的演出——看京剧“四川白毛女”

    富有创造性的演出
    ——看京剧“四川白毛女”
    颜长珂
    “旧社会把人变成鬼，新社会把鬼变成人。”我们已经非常熟悉“白毛女”喜儿的故事了。这是传说，也是事实。四川宜宾的“白毛女”也是历史的一个见证。这位白毛女罗昌秀现在还活着，在党的亲切关怀下幸福地劳动、生活。
    前些时在现代题材戏曲观摩演出中，中国戏曲学校实验京剧团演出的京剧“四川白毛女”就是根据川剧“四川白毛女”和罗昌秀的故事改编的。何长秀（艺术作品中的四川白毛女），这个贫农的女儿，她有着一段和喜儿一样悲惨的经历；但是，两出戏的内容也并不使人感到雷同。
    这个戏的故事发生在解放前四川山区。反动的地主阶级在这偏僻闭塞的地方，更加无法无天。像戏中所写的何锡章这种霸占地方的土豪劣绅，真是无恶不作的。何锡章就是身为“团总”，屁股后面还跟得有打手的人物。在宗族里面，有什么是是非非，也要他们说了才能算。他们有钱、有枪，还有“祖宗”的权力。何锡章对何长秀的父亲，又拉同宗关系，翻过脸来，却是六亲不认；他采用的吊打、“沉潭”那些虐刑，正是宗法统治的特点。这种人物，杀人放火，鱼肉乡里，其残酷野蛮，有特别浓厚的封建性。何锡章为了图谋二亩“鱼龙地”，“把祖坟起那儿去，辈辈准能出两个县长。”逼得何长秀家破人亡。然而在这种封建重压下，农民的斗争性也特别强烈。何长保在忍无可忍的时候，便会放火报仇；何长秀在山里，能够坚强地生活十二年。都表现出了劳动人民不屈的斗争意志。这出戏虽是反映反对封建地主的斗争，但对今天的观众，尤其是青年一代，是一堂深刻、生动的阶级教育课。
    戏的演出非常动人。何长秀被逼上山以后的几场戏，更是如此。寒来暑往，深山里的岁月是漫长而又艰苦的。她为了活下去，要攀山越岭，采集野果、草根，要与虎狼争命。是什么力量在支持着她？是阶级的仇恨、复仇的决心，是对于山下受苦受难的老母的深厚感情。“思亲”一场，便集中地抒发了这种感情。这里采用了大段二黄唱腔，吸收了梆子、高拨子的曲调，溶合了老生、花脸的唱法。高亢激越、沉厚，把长秀爱与憎、思念和悲愤交织的深情，一泄无余。这段唱词也写得形象、生动，感情充沛，和谐的韵律更增强了语言的感染力。特别让我们感动的是长秀从寒风凛冽，想起了老母在山下度日艰难，便送去了一点干柴。她见到房侧的地也荒了，便拿起镢头松土。女儿想念母亲，但是，她想到自己今天的模样和处境：“哎呀母亲哪，你纵然胆儿壮、性儿刚，见了儿不畏惧，不躲藏，定比不见更心伤，分别还会更断肠。若被歹人来窥见，反为母亲添祸殃。”母亲也想念女儿，然而，茫茫群山，哪里去找？门内门外，咫尺天涯。长秀把“妈”字叫出声来，又不得不咽下去了。是谁把她们逼到了这种地步？看到这儿，我不禁联想到歌剧“白毛女”中，杨白劳为喜儿扎头绳的情节。这两段戏，都是写的劳动人民的亲子之情，但情境不同。“白毛女”中，欢乐中饱含着心酸的眼泪；这里，没有眼泪，没有啼哭，却是在凄怆中蕴蓄着强烈的控诉！最后，解放军帮助了她们母女见面，也是一场震撼人心的好戏。
    中国戏曲学校实验京剧团选择了“四川白毛女”作为创作题材，也是有意为京剧反映现实生活摸索经验。从演出看来，他们是取得了一定成绩的。剧本的情节连贯，矛盾发展很快，次要场子写得简洁、明快，但到了冲突的顶端，又能集中笔墨，尽量发挥了戏曲唱做念打的特长，为表演提供了充实的基础。像前面谈到的“思亲”、“送柴”、“见面”等场便是。这就使得性格刻划更加鲜明，主题思想也表达得更突出。在导演和表演方面，对于怎样解决新内容与传统形式的矛盾，更有许多创造性的尝试。形象塑造采用了原有行当，但又有大胆的突破。演员的念白学习了传统中“韵白”“京白”的特点，把生活语言加以提炼、诗化。对字音、韵味的讲求，都是为了更好地表达人物和情绪。对于传统的表演程式，也是大胆采用，却又避免了生搬硬套，技术堆砌。
    整个戏的演出是非常齐整的。看得出来，演员们很有集体主义精神，但每个演员又都有出色的创造。显示了这个年轻剧团朝气蓬勃的精神。他们演出的“白蛇传”“伐子都”等戏曾经获得了全国广大观众的赞誉；这次演出的“四川白毛女”则是在现代戏创作道路上迈出了重要的一步，成就更是可贵。由于它，再一次有力地证明了京剧表现现代题材不仅完全可能，而且有着比一些地方戏更为广阔的前途。
