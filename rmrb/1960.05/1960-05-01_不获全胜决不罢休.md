Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 30th -- 200,000 people from all walks of life in Jinan held a rally on the 29th to support the patriotic and just struggle of the South Korean people.

Liu Binglin, member of the Standing Committee of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke at the meeting on behalf of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, expressing utmost indignation at the bloody crimes of the U.S. imperialists and the Syngman Rhee puppet clique in massacring and suppressing the South Korean people, and expressing deep sympathy and active support for the South Korean people who are fighting heroically for democratic freedom and the right to survival. He pointed out that the current struggle of the South Korean people against the U.S. imperialists and the Syngman Rhee puppet clique is the total eruption of the anger suppressed in the hearts of the South Korean people for fifteen years under the reactionary rule of the U.S. and Rhee. He said that the South Korean people deeply understand from their own painful experience that the U.S. imperialist policy of aggression and colonial rule is the root cause of all the suffering and disasters of the South Korean people, and the flames of the South Korean people's struggle will burn ever more fiercely. The struggle will never stop until U.S. imperialism gets out of South Korea.

The meeting finally adopted a telegram supporting the patriotic and just struggle of the South Korean people. After the meeting, a grand demonstration was also held.
