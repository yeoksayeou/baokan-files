Xinhua News Agency, May 20th: Japanese political parties and organizations issued statements on the 20th, angrily protesting the crime of the Nobusuke Kishi clique for illegally and forcibly passing the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty through violent means.

The statement of the Japanese "National Council Against Revision of the Security Treaty" said that Nobusuke Kishi brought a large number of thugs into the Diet building last night, and then brought in police forces. With their help, the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and the proposal to extend the Diet session were forcibly "passed" in the Diet. This violent action is not only a challenge to public opinion, opposition parties, and the anti-treaty movement, but also a challenge to the anti-mainstream factions within the ruling party. We protest with extreme indignation the improper measures taken by the government and the ruling party.

Now Nobusuke Kishi has exposed his true nature: he is the Japanese equivalent of the already overthrown Syngman Rhee. We demand the immediate collective resignation of the Nobusuke Kishi government.

The "National Council Against Revision of the Security Treaty" announced that it will rapidly strengthen the united people's movement against the "Security Treaty" and will do its utmost to prepare for a large-scale general strike by workers. It will exert all efforts to launch a nationwide protest movement and mobilize a large number of people to go to the Diet.

The statement of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party called on all Japanese people to strengthen the struggle until the Nobusuke Kishi government is overthrown, the Diet is dissolved, and the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" is smashed.

The statement pointed out that the actions taken by Nobusuke Kishi are the same in nature as those taken by Syngman Rhee before he was overthrown.

The statement said, "Nobusuke Kishi has now exposed himself as the most loyal agent of U.S. imperialism." The statement pointed out that Nobusuke Kishi's brutal actions will certainly accelerate his own destruction. The statement said, "Under the present circumstances, if the Japanese people strengthen their common struggle, they may be able to dissolve the Diet and smash the revised Security Treaty."

The statement said, "The real struggle has just begun. Let us support the unified action against the 'Security Treaty' with a large-scale workers' strike, so as to make the movement victorious."

The statement of the Japanese Socialist Party said: "Now, the authority of the Diet has been fundamentally trampled upon. We deny all decisions of the Liberal Democratic Party. We oppose their dictatorial politics, we want to overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet, and we demand the immediate dissolution of the Diet."

The statement said: The Socialist Party "does not recognize that the new U.S.-Japan Security Treaty has been passed and will reject it forever." The statement said: "We guarantee that we will fight until the final victory."

The Central Executive Committee of the Japanese Socialist Party decided today to fight with all its strength to overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet, force the dissolution of the Diet, and not to recognize the House of Representatives' "passage" of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. The Socialist Party also decided to widely "call on labor unions, farmers' organizations, small and medium-sized enterprise organizations, etc., to cooperate and launch a national movement aimed at overthrowing the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet and dissolving the Diet.

The Socialist Party believes that the bills for extending the Diet session and the new "Security Treaty" that the Nobusuke Kishi government voted on with the introduction of the police are not valid.

The Socialist Party also decided to not participate in any deliberations in the Diet from today and demanded that Kiyose Ichiro, the Speaker of the House of Representatives who brought the police into the Diet, resign.

The Japanese Democratic Socialist Party also issued a statement early this morning, saying that because the Liberal Democratic Party brought the police into the Diet hall, and because the majority party used violence, the parliamentary system was trampled upon.

The statement said: We refuse to cooperate with the violent and illegal Diet procedures. We demand the immediate dissolution of the House of Representatives and the holding of a general election.

The meeting of all members of the Democratic Socialist Party held this morning decided that the House of Representatives' "passage" of the new "Security Treaty" and the resolution to extend the Diet session are invalid.

This afternoon, the Democratic Socialist Party also held a Diet Countermeasures Committee meeting, deciding to demand the resignation of Kiyose Ichiro, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and firmly demanding that the Speaker of the House of Councillors not extend the Diet session.

Due to the firm resistance of the opposition parties, the Japanese Diet did not meet today.

Iwai Akira, Secretary-General of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, issued a statement saying: "The lawless behavior of the Nobusuke Kishi government last night and early this morning exposed what consequences the revised U.S.-Japan Security Treaty will bring about."

The statement said, "We can never recognize the actions just taken by the Nobusuke Kishi government and Kiyose Ichiro, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, who has neglected parliamentary procedures."

The statement said: "We will unite the broadest public to continue to oppose this treaty. We will mobilize large numbers of people to repeatedly conduct large-scale petitions and hold large-scale strikes in order to overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi government and dissolve the House of Representatives of the Diet."

The "Security Treaty Criticism Group" composed of Japanese cultural figures issued a statement saying: "We will never recognize the result of this atrocity as a legitimate decision of the Diet. The Japanese people must now act to overthrow the Kishi government and smash the government's conspiracies." The statement pointed out: "The Kishi government and the ruling party have trampled on all the norms of parliament, and they are afraid of the increasingly high tide of public anger against the new U.S.-Japan Security Treaty. Their use of rampant violence shows that they themselves lack confidence in persuading the people."

    日本各政党团体号召打倒岸信介卖国政府
    社会党不承认条约已获通过，日共声明说真正的斗争现在刚开始
    “国民会议”将全力掀起抗议运动，总评组织推翻政府的大罢工
    本报综合报道　据新华社20日讯：日本各政党团体20日纷纷发表声明，愤怒抗议岸信介集团施用暴力手段非法强行通过日美军事同盟条约的罪行。
    日本“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”的声明说，岸信介昨天晚上把大批打手引进国会大厦，接着又引进警察部队，在他们的帮助下强行在国会“通过”了日美“安全条约”以及延长国会会期的提案。这种强暴的行动不仅是对舆论、反对党和反对条约的运动的挑战，而且是对执政党中反主流派的挑战。我们极为愤慨地抗议政府和执政党采取的不当措施。
    现在岸信介暴露了他的本质：他是日本的相当于已经倒台的李承晚的人物。我们要求岸信介政府立即集体辞职。
    “阻止修改安全条约国民会议”宣布，它将以很快的速度加强人民反对“安全条约”的统一运动，并将竭尽全力为工人举行大规模的总罢工作好准备。它将竭尽全力掀起全国范围的抗议运动，并动员大量群众前往国会。
    日本共产党中央委员会干部会的声明要求全体日本人民加强斗争，直到推翻岸信介政府、解散国会和粉碎日美“安全条约”为止。
    声明指出，岸信介采取的行动和李承晚在被打倒以前所采取的行动在性质上是一样的。
    声明说，“岸信介现在已经暴露他是美帝国主义者最忠实的代理人。”声明指出，岸信介的这种残暴的行动将肯定加速他自己的毁灭。声明说，“在目前的情况下，如果日本人民加强他们的共同的斗争，那么他们有可能使国会解散并且粉碎已经修改了的安全条约。”
    声明说，“真正的斗争现在还刚开始。让我们用工人大规模罢工的办法来支持反对‘安全条约’的统一行动，从而使运动取得胜利。”
    日本社会党的声明说：“现在，国会的权威已经从根本上遭到了蹂躏。我们否认自由民主党的一切决定。我们反对他们的独裁政治，我们要打倒岸信介内阁，我们要求立即解散国会”。
    声明说：社会党“不承认新日美安全条约已经获得通过，要永远加以拒绝”。声明说：“我们保证我们将一直斗争到获得最后胜利为止。”
    日本社会党中央执行委员会今天决定：要以全力进行斗争，打倒岸信介内阁，迫使解散国会；并且不承认众议院“通过”日美军事同盟条约。社会党并且决定广泛“呼吁工会、农民团体、中小企业团体等进行合作，展开以打倒岸信介内阁和解散国会为目标的国民运动。
    社会党认为，岸信介政府在引进警察的情况下表决的延长国会会期和新“安全条约”的议案并没有成立。
    社会党还决定从今天起不参加国会的一切审议工作，并且要求把警察引进国会的众议院议长清濑一郎辞职。
    日本民主社会党今天清晨也发表声明说，由于自由民主党把警察引进了国会会场，由于多数党使用了暴力，议会制度被蹂躏。
    声明说：我们拒绝同强暴的、非法的国会程序合作。我们要求立即解散众议院、举行大选。
    民主社会党今天早晨举行的全体议员会议决定，众议院“通过”的新“安全条约”和延长国会会期的决议是无效的。
  今天下午，民主社会党还举行国会对策委员会会议，决定要求众议院议长清濑一郎辞职，并且坚决要求参议院议长不要延长国会会期。
    由于在野党的坚决抵制，日本国会今天没有开会。
    日本工会总评议会事务局长岩井章发表声明说：“岸信介政府昨天晚上和今天清晨的无法无天的行为暴露出经过修改的日美安全条约将造成什么样的后果。”
    声明说，“我们决不能承认岸信介政府和玩忽议会程序的众议院议长清濑一郎刚刚采取的行动。”
    声明说：“我们将团结最广泛的公众继续反对这个条约。我们将动员众多的人民反复地进行大规模的请愿和举行大规模的罢工，以便推翻岸信介政府和使国会众议院解散。”
    日本文化界人士组成的“安全条约批判会”发表声明说：“我们决不承认这种暴行的结果是国会的合法决定。日本人民现在必须行动起来，推翻岸政府和粉碎政府的阴谋诡计。”声明指出：“岸政府和执政党践踏了议会的一切准则，他们害怕公众的日益高涨的反对新日美安全条约的愤怒的爆发。他们使用猖狂的暴力的做法说明他们本身对说服人民缺乏信心。”
