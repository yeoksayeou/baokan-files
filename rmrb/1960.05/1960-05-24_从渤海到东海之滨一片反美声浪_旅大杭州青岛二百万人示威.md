From the Bohai Sea to the coast of the East China Sea, an anti-American wave is sweeping across the land.

Two Million People Demonstrate in Lushun-Dalian, Hangzhou, and Qingdao

Lushun-Dalian

According to Xinhua News Agency, Dalian, May 23rd: 1.12 million people from all walks of life in Lushun-Dalian held an unprecedented rally and demonstration on the 22nd to support the Soviet Union's stern stance against the U.S. imperialist aggression and to angrily condemn U.S. imperialism for sabotaging the Four-Power Summit Conference.

The people of Lushun-Dalian lived forty years of darkness under the rule of Japanese imperialism. In 1945, the Soviet army defeated the Japanese fascists and liberated the people of Lushun-Dalian from enslavement. The people of Lushun-Dalian have a deep friendship with the Soviet people, so they are particularly angry at the U.S. imperialist aggression against the Soviet Union. Yesterday morning, the vast number of people in urban and rural areas, including workers, farmers, students, militiamen, citizens, and People's Liberation Army soldiers, flocked to the various meeting places from all directions. In the largest square in the city center—Stalin Square—180,000 people gathered, including Su Hua, a girl who was saved by the Soviet army, family members of volunteer army martyrs, and volunteer army veterans who fought against the U.S. invading army on the Korean battlefield. They unanimously expressed their determination to stand firmly with the great Soviet people and to wage an unremitting struggle to completely smash the U.S. imperialist policy of aggression and war. On the hundred-kilometer-long beach, hundreds of thousands of farmers and fishermen held rallies in the fields and work areas. Along the hundreds of kilometers of railway line from the city to Wafangdian, all town residents also held demonstrations and rallies.

Leaders of the Lushun-Dalian Party and government, responsible persons of the CPPCC, local organizations of democratic parties, and various people's organizations participated in the meeting. Also participating in the meeting were generals from the army, navy, and air force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Lushun-Dalian. The entire staff of the Soviet Trade Representative Office in China, the Dalian resident of the Trade Department of the Korean Embassy in China, all Soviet experts working in Dalian, and the heads of Vietnamese students and interns also participated in the meeting.

Hu Ming, Secretary of the Lushun-Dalian Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Mayor of Lushun-Dalian, spoke first at the meeting. He said that today, the imperialists headed by the United States are opposed by the people everywhere in the world, and they are already trapped in the encirclement of the people of the world. We are determined to unite closely with the people of socialist countries and with all oppressed people in the world to fight to the end against the U.S. imperialist policy of aggression and war and for lasting world peace. Hu Ming's speech was repeatedly interrupted by enthusiastic applause and slogans from the crowd in the square.

Warm applause rang out in the square to welcome Yu.A. Fadeev, the representative of the Dalian office of the Soviet Trade Representative Office in China, to speak. He said that in history, there has never been a case like the shameless and arrogant transformation of espionage into an official and open policy as the United States is doing today. The shamelessness of the U.S. ruling clique is now fully exposed in the eyes of the people of the world, and this "Cold War" instigator will inevitably suffer a shameful end.

Subsequently, speeches were given at the meeting by Shen Tao, Vice Chairman of the Lushun-Dalian Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, representatives of various people's organizations, representatives of local organizations of democratic parties, and representatives of workers and farmers.

After the meeting, the masses who participated in the meeting poured into the streets to hold demonstrations.

Hangzhou

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, May 23rd: 500,000 people from all walks of life in Zhejiang Province and Hangzhou City held an unprecedented rally and demonstration on the afternoon of the 22nd to support the Soviet government's stern position on the U.S. imperialist aggression and to oppose U.S. imperialism's sabotage of the Four-Power Summit Conference.

Yesterday, the entire city of Hangzhou was in a state of excitement. In the mighty demonstration procession, workers, farmers, students, residents, and fully armed militiamen, holding high red flags, carrying huge banners and cartoons, converged into a vast ocean of people. U.S. imperialism's aggression and provocation against the Soviet Union aroused the infinite anger of the people of Zhejiang Province. Liu Laiwan, an advanced producer in the national industrial system and a worker at the Zhejiang Fengshan Steel Plant, said, "We have long seen the ugly face of U.S. imperialism's false peace and real war preparations. We have never had any illusions about imperialism, because a thief is always a thief, and a robber is always a robber." Ying Yungen, a returned volunteer soldier who fought against the U.S. invading army on the Korean battlefield and a student at Zhejiang Medical University, said, "On the Korean battlefield, the U.S. aggressors were our defeated soldiers. If they dare to launch a war, we will resolutely smash them to pieces."

Party and government leaders of Zhejiang Province and Hangzhou City, military leaders stationed in the area, responsible persons of various democratic parties and people's organizations, and Soviet and other fraternal countries' experts and foreign guests in Hangzhou participated in the meeting.

Chen Weida, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke first at the meeting. He pointed out that U.S. imperialism's sabotage of the Four-Power Summit Conference was premeditated. The facts of its provocation against the Soviet Union and its sabotage of the Four-Power Summit Conference once again prove a truth to the people of the world: there can be no unrealistic illusions about U.S. imperialism and Eisenhower. Now the people of the world have a clearer understanding of the essence of U.S. imperialism, will unite more closely, and will carry out an indomitable struggle against the U.S.-led imperialist war forces to defend world peace.

Also speaking at the meeting were Liu Dan, Vice Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, representatives of provincial and municipal people's organizations, representatives of local organizations of various democratic parties at the provincial and municipal levels, and representatives of workers and farmers.

Yesterday, the entire city of Qingdao was in a state of excitement. Workers, farmers, students, government cadres, officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, and fully armed militiamen, holding various banners, marched towards various meeting venues. Towns in the outer suburbs also held rallies and demonstrations.

Party and government leaders of Qingdao City, leaders of the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Qingdao, Soviet experts in Qingdao, and others participated in the meeting held at the Workers' Stadium.

Qu Wen, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Qingdao Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke at the meeting. He said that the people of Qingdao, like the people of the whole country, resolutely oppose U.S. imperialist aggression and provocation against the Soviet Union and fully support the Soviet Union's stern position on the Four-Power Summit Conference.

    旅大市人民曾经在日本帝国主义统治下过了四十年暗无天日的生活，1945年苏联军队击溃了日本法西斯，把旅大人民从奴役中解放出来。旅大人民和苏联人民有着深厚情谊，因此他们对美帝国主义侵略苏联的罪行特别感到愤怒。昨天一清早，广大城乡人民，包括工人、农民、学生、民兵、市民和人民解放军战士，就从四面八方涌向各个集会场所。在市中心最大的广场——斯大林广场上，汇集了十八万人，其中有被苏军救活的女孩子苏华，有志愿军烈士家属，也有在朝鲜战场上同美国侵略军较量过的志愿军复员军人们。他们一致表示坚决同伟大的苏联人民站在一起，为彻底粉碎美帝国主义的侵略和战争政策而进行坚持不懈的斗争。在绵延百十公里的海滩上，成千上万的农民和渔民在田头和作业区分别举行了集会。在从市区到瓦房店之间数百公里长的铁路沿线，所有城镇居民也都普遍举行示威集会。

    广场上响起了热烈的掌声，欢迎苏联驻华商务代表处驻大连机关的代表尤·阿·法捷耶夫讲话。他说，在历史上还没有过像美国今天所干出那样厚颜无耻，蛮横地把间谍活动变成官方的一种公开政策的事情。美国统治集团的无耻，今天在全世界人民的眼里暴露无遗，这个“冷战”的挑拨者必将遭到可耻的下场。
