Comrades! Friends!

The signing of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty is the greatest scourge for the Asian people and a grave threat to world peace. Its spearhead is aimed at China and the Soviet Union, and it directly threatens the security of the people of Southeast Asian countries first and foremost. It will bring endless disasters to the Japanese people. We Chinese people, as well as all peace-loving people around the world, must resolutely support the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and against the revival of Japanese militarism.

Now is the 1960s of the 20th century. The East wind has prevailed over the West wind and will continue to prevail over the West wind. The strength of the socialist camp, the strength of the national democratic movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and the strength of the world peace movement have far surpassed the imperialist forces of war and aggression. In today's era of increasing popular awareness, no reactionary force can stop the angry tide of the people against domestic and foreign reactionaries. The volcanoes under the feet of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs have erupted one after another. The U.S. imperialism and the Nobusuke Kishi reactionary clique are determined to be enemies of the Japanese people, enemies of the Chinese people, and enemies of all peace-loving people in the world. They will inevitably perish, be crushed to pieces under the wheels of history, and suffer a more shameful end than German fascists and Tojo.

We, the entire membership of the China Democratic National Construction Association, like all the Chinese people, are full of confidence in the Japanese people's just struggle. We Chinese people have always been friendly to the Japanese people. We are determined to work closely with the Japanese people and the peace-loving people of Asia and the world to smash the war and aggression conspiracies of the U.S.-Japanese reactionary group and defend Asian and world peace. The Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty is a just struggle, and no force can stop the victorious advance of the Japanese people.

Let us shout:

Resolutely support the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle!

U.S. imperialism get out of Japan! Get out of South Korea, South Vietnam, Turkey, and the Philippines! Get out of our territory of Taiwan!

Down with the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries!

People of the world, unite and fight to the end against imperialist aggression and to defend world peace!

    美日反动派必将自取灭亡
    中国民主建国会主任委员黄炎培的讲话同志们！朋友们！
    日美军事同盟条约的签订，是亚洲人民的最大祸根，也是世界和平的严重威胁。它的矛头针对着中国和苏联，而且首先直接威胁到东南亚各国人民的安全，对于日本人民更将带来无穷的灾害。我们中国人民以及全世界爱好和平的人民，必须坚决支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约，反对复活日本军国主义的爱国正义斗争。
    现在是二十世纪的六十年代，东风已经压倒西风，并将继续压倒西风。社会主义阵营的力量，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲民族民主运动的力量和世界和平运动的力量，已经大大超过帝国主义的战争侵略势力。在今天人民日益觉醒的时代，任何反动势力都阻止不了人民反对国内外反动派的怒潮。美帝国主义及其走狗脚下的火山，已经一座又一座地爆发起来了。美帝国主义和岸信介反动集团决心同日本人民为敌，同中国人民和全世界爱好和平人民为敌，一定会自取灭亡，在历史的巨轮下粉身碎骨，一定会遭到比德国法西斯和东条更为可耻的下场。
    我们中国民主建国会全体成员，和全中国人民一样，对于日本人民的正义斗争充满着信心。我们中国人民向来对日本人民是友好的。我们决心和日本人民和亚洲及全世界爱好和平的人民一起，紧密携手，为粉碎美日反动集团的战争侵略阴谋，保卫亚洲和世界和平而共同奋斗。日本人民反对美日军事同盟条约的斗争是正义的斗争，任何力量都阻挡不了日本人民的胜利前进。
    让我们高呼：
    坚决支持日本人民的爱国正义斗争！
    美帝国主义从日本滚出去！从南朝鲜、南越、土耳其、菲律宾滚出去！从我国领土台湾滚出去！
    打倒美日反动派！
    全世界人民团结起来，为反对帝国主义侵略、保卫世界和平而奋斗到底！
