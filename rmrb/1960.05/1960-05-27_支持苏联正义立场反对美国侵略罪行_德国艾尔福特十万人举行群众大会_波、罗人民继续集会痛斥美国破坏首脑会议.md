Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 25th: In Erfurt, the famous flower-producing city of the German Democratic Republic, 100,000 working people held a mass rally this afternoon. In a resolution, they strongly condemned the American provocation against the Soviet Union and supported the position taken by Soviet Premier Khrushchev in Paris.

Gerhard Schenkel, First Secretary of the Erfurt City Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, emphasized in his speech that the forces of peace, led by the Soviet Union, are now stronger than the American provocateurs.

The Free German Trade Union Youth Committee, which met in Magdeburg on the 24th, received many telegrams from youth work teams in factories condemning the American policy of aggression. The young people pledged to redouble their efforts to strive for disarmament and the conclusion of a peace treaty with the two Germanys, and to complete production plans on time to ensure quantity, quality, and variety of products.

The principals of universities and colleges in the German Democratic Republic issued a statement today condemning the United States for sabotaging the Four-Power Summit Conference.

Hans Loch, Chairman of the German Free Democratic Party, wrote in today's "Morning Post": "The attempt by the American ruling clique to cover up their aggressive policies with false peace rhetoric in Paris has failed. The exposure of American policy has helped peace-loving people in Western countries and encouraged them to take new action. It has clearly shown many people where the danger lies, who represents peace, and who is instigating war."

Many local newspapers published a large number of reader letters, which unanimously condemned the United States for sabotaging the Four-Power Summit Conference and supported the Soviet Union's position.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, May 25th: The Polish working people continue to hold rallies in support of the just position of the Soviet government.

The Presidium and Executive Committee of the Central Council of Polish Trade Unions held a joint meeting on the 24th, presided over by Loga-Sowiński, Chairman of the Central Council, and adopted a resolution supporting the Soviet Union. The resolution stated that when the US government provocatively violated Soviet airspace and declared America's aggressive espionage activities as state policy, the holding of the summit conference was in fact futile and impossible. American militaristic aggression and the "Cold War" bloc should bear full responsibility for sabotaging the summit conference.

In the name of millions of Polish working people, the Presidium and Executive Committee of the Central Council of Polish Trade Unions expressed their firm support for the Soviet Union's position in exposing the current US policy and its support for the Soviet Union's counterattack against the most enthusiastic implementers of US imperialism and aggressive policies—the West German militarist revanchists.

The resolution concluded by saying that relying on the growing strength of the masses of the people and the forces of peace, the international labor movement has the power to stop the aggressors.

In recent days, many factories in Lodz and Białystok have held open party meetings to condemn the US for sabotaging the summit conference and to support the Soviet Union's position. Many workers spoke indignantly at the meetings.

The Liebknecht factory in Lodz held a rally on the 22nd and passed a resolution saying: "We condemn Eisenhower and other American leaders for their double-dealing tactics, for which they are responsible for the breakdown of the summit conference."

The masses of the Lodz textile factory said in a resolution passed on the 21st: "We condemn the actions of the US government, which sabotaged the summit conference with provocative and aggressive acts."

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, May 25th: Some factories in the Romanian capital and other cities such as Bacău and Reșița held rallies today to protest against the crimes of US imperialism in sabotaging the Four-Power Summit Conference.

The "Mao Zedong" Machine Manufacturing Plant in Bucharest held a protest rally on the afternoon of the 25th, with more than two thousand employees participating. At the meeting, turner Nicolae said that the US government and the reactionary group of American militarists sabotaged the summit conference. Before the meeting even started, they launched a propaganda campaign to sabotage the conference. American leaders made various hostile statements and organized sabotage activities, the most blatant of which was sending spy planes to invade Soviet airspace. He said that the Soviet Union sternly exposed the US "Cold War" policy and its conspiracy to deceive the people of the world. The US government should bear full responsibility for sabotaging the Four-Power Summit Conference.

Electric welder Gheorghe also said angrily at the meeting: "After the American aggressive actions were exposed by the Soviet Union, the US Secretary of Defense instead announced a general exercise, which proves that the United States stubbornly continues to implement the Cold War policy. In the name of all the workers in the factory, I warn the imperialists not to play with fire. The imperialists should know that the Romanian people demand peace and know how to give the enemies of peace the deserved response."

The workers of the "Mao Zedong" Machine Manufacturing Plant also unanimously adopted a resolution at the protest rally. The resolution stated: "We fully support the firm position of the Soviet Union and are determined to raise our vigilance and answer the provocations of imperialism by strengthening the forces for peace."

Workers in the cities of Bacău and Reșița also held protest rallies on the 25th.

According to Xinhua News Agency on the 23rd: The Romanian working people continue to condemn with great indignation the crimes of the United States in sending spy planes to invade Soviet airspace and sabotaging the Four-Power Summit Conference, and fully support the solemn position taken by Khrushchev in his statement in Paris on the 16th.

Răţiu, Vice-Chairman of the Central Council of the Romanian Coal Miners' Union, wrote in "Labor Newspaper" that the Romanian miners, together with the working people of the whole country, wholeheartedly support the position of the Soviet Union. He pointed out that the representatives of the US aggressive policy carried out actions that violated the interests of peace and even sent spy planes to invade the Soviet Union. These aggressive actions by the American militarists only expose more clearly to the whole world that they are the enemies of peace and international detente.
