    The Fate of "Black Camps" is Only Extinction
    Yuan Ying
    More than three years ago, when we visited some cities and villages in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, we heard many stories about the crimes of the French colonialists and their "Foreign Legion." We walked through villages that had been burned and looted, and had not fully recovered even two years after the ceasefire. The fathers, elders, brothers and sisters of Vietnam all spoke with unparalleled indignation and contempt about these inhuman two-legged jackals. They said that in the face of innocent people, they were bloodthirsty beasts; but in the face of the heroic Vietnamese People's Army, they became cowards who scurried away at the first sound of gunfire. In a guerrilla base in Thai Binh province, we visited some veteran guerrillas and saw the underground trenches and bamboo spikes that had once terrified the enemy. The heroic Vietnamese people proved to the world with their own actions that only by using an iron fist to deal with the barbaric imperialists and colonialists can they be made to honestly lower their heads.
    The new Czechoslovak film "Black Camp" reminded me of the concentration camps in the Hong Gai mining area, the large bunkers on the banks of the Red River and along the roads, and the "scorched earth" areas destroyed by the colonialists, leaving only three betel nut trees... Aren't these all the deeds of the butchers of "Black Camp"? Look, at the sound of machine guns, groups of kind people fell; the elderly didn't have time to say a word, and the children didn't understand what was happening before they fell under the butchers' strafing fire. How beautiful the girl was, before she died, she still had her necklace snatched away by the beasts. Was it put around her neck by her mother since she was a child, or was it a souvenir from her lover?
    The film "Black Camp" uses startling strokes to depict the essence of this dirty war, and uses eloquent facts to point out the truth that imperialist colonial wars are bound to fail. Because of this, the film's dissection of the internal workings of this colonial army is very convincing. The officers are engaged in infighting, spending their days drinking and gambling; the soldiers are demoralized, selling their lives to the French invaders for a few coins. The "Foreign Legion" is full of ruffians, hooligans, thieves, stormtroopers of Hitler and young people who have been deceived and trapped.
    Among these unfortunate young people who have been caught in the "Foreign Legion" are Vaclav from Czechoslovakia, Peter, Gerhard from West Germany, and Tadeusz from Poland, who all share the same feeling of disgust for the dirty colonial war and want to leave the "Black Camp."
    Some of them are actively trying to escape to the Vietnamese army, but the cowardly Vaclav doesn't dare to risk his life. He is first happy to be a servant for the officer Wolff, because this way he doesn't have to fight, but when he learns that this Wolff is the fascist executioner who shot his father and sister, when he thinks of the many kind residents of his hometown who were killed by the Wolffs, the fire of hatred burns in his chest, and he wants revenge. In the next battle, he and Wolff go to the forest to scout the terrain, and neither of them ever return. The strengthened Czechoslovak youth dies together with the fascist bandit.
    Vaclav's image is that of an ordinary soldier in the colonial army. He is unwilling to give his life for the invading army for nothing, and unwilling to slaughter unarmed residents. He is distressed and wandering, unable to find a way out. In this young man, the filmmakers and actors fully reveal the injustice of the colonial war and how unpopular it is. From Vaclav's experience, we can also clearly see how the colonial army is disintegrating and in a mess. This film helps us to vividly recognize the ugly face of the colonialists and encourages the people to oppose imperialism. All oppressed and enslaved people, the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, will, like the Vietnamese people, use unyielding struggles to force the imperialists riding on their heads to bow their heads and drive them into the sea. Nothing can save the doomed fate of the extinction of all "black camps" of all imperialists and colonialists.

    “黑营”的命运只有复灭
    袁鹰
    三年多以前，当我们访问越南民主共和国的一些城市和村庄的时候，我们曾经听到过许多有关法国殖民者和它们的“外籍军团”的罪行，我们走过那些曾经被烧光、抢光的村落，在停战两年之后，还没有完全恢复。越南的父老兄弟姐妹们，人人以无比愤慨和蔑视的语调，谈到这些没有人性的两脚豺狼。说他们在无辜的人民面前，是杀人不眨眼的野兽；在英雄的越南人民军面前，却成了一听见枪声就抱头鼠窜的虫豸。在太平省的一个游击根据地，我们访问了一些老游击队员，看到了那些曾经使敌人心惊胆战的地下战壕和竹蒺藜。英雄的越南人民用自己的行动向全世界证明：只有用铁拳对付野蛮的帝国主义者、殖民主义者，才能使它们老实地低下头。
    捷克斯洛伐克的新影片“黑营”，使我想起了鸿基矿区的集中营，想起红河岸上和公路两旁的大碉堡，想起了被殖民者毁灭得只剩下三棵槟榔树的“烧区”……这一切，不都是“黑营”的屠夫们干的勾当么？你看，机枪响处，一群群善良的老百姓倒下去了，老年人没有来得及说一句话，孩子们还没有懂得这是怎么一回事，就在屠夫们的扫射下倒下了。多么美丽的姑娘，在临死以前，还被野兽们抢走她的项链。——是妈妈从小就替她挂在颈子上的，还是情人的纪念品？
    电影“黑营”用使人惊心怵目的笔触，描绘出这场肮脏战争的本质，用雄辩的事实，指出帝国主义的殖民战争必然失败的真理。也因为这样，影片对这批殖民军队内部所作的解剖，已是十分令人信服的了。军官们勾心斗角，整天就是喝酒打牌；士兵们军心涣散，为了几个钱替法国侵略者卖命。“外籍军团”里，尽是一些兵痞、流氓、盗犯、希特勒的冲锋队员和被欺骗落入圈套的青年。
    在这些不幸而陷身“外籍军团”的青年人中，有捷克斯洛伐克人瓦茨拉夫，彼得，西德青年格尔哈尔特和波兰人塔杰乌什，他们都怀着同样的心情，对肮脏的殖民战争充满了厌恶，想离开“黑营”。
    他们之中，有的人在积极地想办法逃到越南军去，但胆怯的瓦茨拉夫却不敢去冒生命的危险。他先是为跟军官沃尔夫当勤务兵而高兴，因为这样可以不去打仗，但当他知道这个沃尔夫就是当年枪杀他父亲和姐姐的法西斯刽子手的时候，当他想到他的家乡许多善良的居民被沃尔夫们杀害的时候，仇恨的烈火在他胸中燃烧，他要报仇。在下一次战斗中，他跟着沃尔夫两个人到森林里侦察地形，从此两个人都没有回来。坚强起来的捷克斯洛伐克青年同法西斯匪徒同归于尽。
    瓦茨拉夫的形象，是殖民军队中一个普通士兵的形象。他不愿意白白替侵略军送命，不愿意屠杀手无寸铁的居民，他苦闷徬徨，找不到出路。在这个青年人身上，电影制作者和演员充分地揭示出殖民战争的非正义性，它是怎样地不得人心。从瓦茨拉夫的经历中，我们也可以清清楚楚地看到：殖民军队的内部，是怎样地分崩离析，一团糟。这个电影帮助我们形象地认识到殖民主义者的嘴脸，鼓舞人民反对帝国主义的决心，一切受压迫、受奴役的人民，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲国家的人们，都会像越南人民一样，用不屈不挠的斗争，来迫使骑在他们头上的帝国主义者低头，把它们赶下大海。什么都挽救不了所有帝国主义、殖民主义者一切“黑营”的复灭命运。
