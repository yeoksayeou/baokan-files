    Teachers and students in many schools across the country have actively engaged in the mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution, reforming and creating teaching tools and equipment. This is a significant undertaking.
    In recent years, especially since the Great Leap Forward, the demand for teaching tools has increased tenfold or a hundredfold along with the great development of education. As the teaching reform deepens, schools at all levels and of all types have increased teaching materials reflecting modern science and technology, which requires schools to modify and add new teaching tools and experimental equipment to meet actual needs. Currently, many regions are vigorously running full-time and part-time universities, and various industrial and mining enterprises, government organizations, and people's communes are establishing spare-time universities. How can we solve the difficulties of insufficient teachers and inadequate equipment? One solution is to implement educational technology. To achieve this, we must combine indigenous and foreign methods to produce educational technology equipment. In addition, due to the development of the mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution, both teaching content and experimental equipment should adapt to the continuous development of modern science and technology and catch up with the advanced world level. This requires a substantial increase in modern teaching aids and experimental equipment. Using teaching aids such as slides, films, and models to assist teaching, and conducting experiments with modern instruments, meters, reagents, and equipment, makes it possible to explain and learn advanced science and technology deeply and thoroughly. Therefore, the major reform of teaching aids and equipment has become one of the necessary material conditions for improving teaching quality and learning modern culture and science.
    To carry out a major reform and creation of teaching tools and equipment, we must adhere to putting politics in command, launch mass movements on a large scale, fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of teachers, students, and staff, combine it with the technical innovation and technical revolution movements of factories and people's communes outside the school, and launch a technical innovation and technical revolution movement for teaching tools, instruments, and equipment. Under the guidance of the Party's educational policy of combining education with productive labor, the broad masses of teachers and students have accumulated experience in production practice and gradually become able to both use their brains and work with their hands. This is a very favorable condition for carrying out technical revolution. In Shanghai, Beijing, Harbin, and many other universities, secondary schools, and even primary schools across the country, thousands upon thousands of new teaching aids, new instruments, and new experimental equipment have been modified and invented. We must seize this excellent situation and continue to mobilize the masses. Implement the policy of moving from small to large, from simple to complex, making use of what is available, and combining indigenous and foreign methods, and implement mutual collaboration between schools and between factories and schools. Party organizations in schools should strengthen leadership, guide teachers and students to concentrate their efforts on solving one or two major problems within a certain period of time, gradually complete the reform of complete sets of teaching equipment, and move towards creating high-level, sophisticated, and advanced modern teaching tools and experimental equipment.
    At present, the development speed of education is extremely fast, and the aspects of teaching reform are extremely broad. Educational technology equipment, new experimental instruments, meters, reagents, and various other equipment are urgently needed for production. Schools should adhere to the principle of self-reliance as the primary focus, vigorously run factories, and produce large quantities of various teaching tools and teaching equipment such as instruments and models for teaching purposes. The production of these tools and instruments should be under unified planning, with factories built according to specialization, and combined with factories and scientific research institutions to give full play to their strengths and vigorously produce.
    Introducing technical innovation and technical revolution into schools, and making major reforms in the school’s teaching tools and experimental equipment is an inseparable and important part of the current educational revolution. It will further improve the political, cultural, and scientific level of teachers and students, and further develop China's education undertakings with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

    大力改革和制造教学工具
    全国许多学校师生，积极地投入了技术革新和技术革命的全民运动，革新和创制了教学工具和教学设备，这是一件大事。
    几年来，特别是大跃进以来，在教育事业大发展的同时，教学工具的需要也在成十倍成百倍地增长。教学改革的深入开展，各级各类学校都增加了反映现代科学技术知识的教材，这就要求学校改制和增加新的教学工具和实验仪器设备，以适应实际的需要。现在，许多地区都大办全日制半日制的高等学校，各个工矿企业、机关、人民公社要办业余的高等学校。怎样解决师资不足、设备不够的困难呢？办法之一是实行电化教育。而要作到这一点，就必须土洋结合，制作电化教学的设备。此外，由于全民的技术革新和技术革命运动的发展，无论是教学内容、实验设备都应当适应现代科学技术的不断发展，赶上世界先进水平。这就必须大量增加现代化教学用具和实验设备。利用幻灯、电影、模型等教具来辅助教学，用现代仪器、仪表、试剂、设备来进行实验，就有可能把先进的科学技术讲深讲透、学深学透。所以教具和设备的大改革已经成为提高教学质量，学习现代文化科学所必需的物质条件之一。
    进行教学用具、设备的大改革和创制，必须坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，充分发挥广大师生员工的积极性和创造性，与校外的工厂、人民公社的技术革新和技术革命运动相结合，开展一个教学工具、仪器设备的技术革新和技术革命运动。广大师生在党的教育和生产劳动相结合的教育方针指导下，都已经积累了生产实践的经验，逐步做到既能动脑、又能动手了。这是大搞技术革命的十分有利的条件。上海、北京、哈尔滨以及全国许许多多的高等学校、中等学校以至小学已经有成千成万项新教具、新仪器、新实验设备被改制和发明创造出来。我们要抓住这一大好形势，继续发动群众。贯彻由小到大、由简到繁、因陋就简、土洋结合的方针，实行校际之间、厂校之间互相协作。学校党组织要加强领导，引导教师学生集中精力在一定时期内解决一两项主要问题，逐步完成成套的教学设备的改革，并向创制高大精尖的现代化教学工具和实验设备的方向前进。
    目前，教育事业发展速度极快，教学改革的方面又极广，电化教学用具、新的实验用的仪器、仪表、试剂以及其他种种设备亟待投入生产。学校应当坚持以自力更生为主的原则，大办工厂，大量生产各种教学用具和供教学用的仪器、模型等教学设备。这些用具和仪器的生产要在统一规划下，分工建厂，并和工厂、科学研究机关相结合、发挥所长，大力生产。
    把技术革新和技术革命引进学校，使学校的教学用具、实验设备大革新是当前教育革命不可分割的一个重要部分。它将进一步提高教师、学生的政治的和文化科学的水平，进一步多快好省地发展我国教育事业。
