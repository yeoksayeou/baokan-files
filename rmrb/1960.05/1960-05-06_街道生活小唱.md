Street Life Serenade
    He Bo

    The spring night organizes the canteen, the stars in the sky are sparkling, and the locust trees filter the moonlight; in this gentle spring night, the whole courtyard is filled with joyful voices. How many beautiful imaginations, how much passion from the bottom of the heart, fly out of everyone's mouth, accompanied by hearty laughter. We are organizing the canteen, calculating the firewood, rice, oil, and salt; the cooking utensils are ready, and the personnel are properly determined. A happy courtyard, harmonious neighbors, united as a family, will embark on a new schedule. Everyone has a job, and everyone has a bright future; thinking of the beautiful future, we will never forget the kindness of the Party. The stars in the sky are sparkling, and the whole courtyard is filled with joyful voices; we embrace a common ideal and welcome the birth of the courtyard canteen.

    The First Meal
    I love my factory, I love the canteen in the courtyard; the factory has given me a glorious post, and the canteen has completely liberated me. I came back from the electric appliance factory after work, and went to the canteen to eat the first meal; my heart was as excited as the sea, and as happy as a bird flying. I, a housewife, have now joined the production, become a worker, and contribute to the motherland. I, a housewife, have gotten rid of the entanglement of housework; I dedicate my youth to the motherland and no longer revolve around my personal stove. When I pick up my bowl and chopsticks and eat the hot dishes and rice, my heart is as excited as the sea, and as happy as a bird flying. As I eat, I think to myself: How should I do my job well? With the hands of all of us, we will finally realize the communist ideal.

    街道生活小唱
    禾波
    春夜组织食堂天上星光晶莹，槐树筛着月影；在这柔和的春夜，满院人声欢腾。多少美丽的想像，多少心底的激情，从每个人口中飞出，伴着爽朗的笑声。我们在组织食堂，计算着柴米油盐；炊具已经备好，人员妥善决定。幸福的大院，和睦的邻居，团结如一家人，将走向新的日程。人人有了工作，个个前途似锦；想着未来美景，难忘党的恩情。天上星光晶莹，满院人声欢腾；我们抱着共同理想，迎接大院食堂诞生。
    第一顿饭我爱我的工厂，我爱院里的食堂；工厂哪，给了我光荣的岗位，食堂哪，使我彻底解放。我从电器厂下班回来，到食堂去吃第一顿饭；心情像海水激动，又像鸟儿快活飞翔。我啊，一个家庭妇女，如今参加了生产，变成一个工人，为祖国贡献力量。我啊，一个家庭妇女，摆脱了家务纠缠；把青春献给祖国，再不围绕个人锅台打转。当我拿起碗筷，吃着热腾腾的菜饭，心情像海水激动，又像鸟儿快活飞翔。我吃着饭，低头想：应该怎样做好工作？用我们大家的双手，最后实现共产主义的理想。
