Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, May 5th: Thakin Kodaw Hmaing, Chairman of the Burmese Peace Committee and renowned writer, said here today that the Sino-Nepalese Treaty of Peace and Friendship, signed after the Sino-Burmese agreement on border issues and the Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression, once again demonstrates that the Chinese government consistently adheres to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, thus placing the imperialists who are accustomed to spreading rumors and slander in a difficult position once again. He told Xinhua reporters that the Bandung Spirit and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence have great vitality.

Regarding the Sino-Indian border issue, Thakin Kodaw Hmaing said he was saddened to hear that there was no agreement on the Sino-Indian border issue. Thakin Kodaw Hmaing said that Premier Zhou Enlai went to India with sincerity, and his talks in India received great praise from peace-loving people around the world.

Thakin Kodaw Hmaing emphasized that in the face of ruthless and cunning imperialism, the most important task for the people of Asia is to unite, care for each other, and help each other. Only in this way can we completely shatter the imperialist conspiracy to incite and enslave Asian countries, and only in this way can we achieve and safeguard national independence, and use our strength for the peaceful construction of our countries in order to change the economic and cultural backwardness caused by imperialist and colonialist aggression. He said that the signing of the Sino-Nepalese border agreement and the Treaty of Peace and Friendship correctly reflects the desire of the Asian and African people for unity, cooperation, and peaceful coexistence.

    新华社仰光5日电　缅甸保卫世界和平委员会主席、著名作家德钦哥都迈今天在这里说，继中缅关于边界问题的协定以及友好和互不侵犯条约之后签订的中尼和平友好条约再一次说明，中国政府一贯遵守和平共处五项原则，从而使惯于造谣诽谤的帝国主义者再一次处于困境。他对新华社记者说，万隆精神和和平共处五项原则有着伟大的生命力。
    德钦哥都迈在谈到中印边界问题时说，他听到说中印边界问题没有协议时感到难过。德钦哥都迈说，周恩来总理是带着一片诚意到印度去的，他在印度发表的谈话受到世界爱好和平人民的极大赞扬。
    德钦哥都迈强调说，在冷酷无情的、狡猾的帝国主义面前，亚洲人民最重要的任务是团结，互相关心和帮助。这样，我们才能够彻底粉碎帝国主义煽动和奴役亚洲国家的阴谋，我们才能够取得和保卫民族独立，把我们的力量用于我国的和平建设，以便改变帝国主义和殖民主义侵略造成的经济和文化上的落后状态。他说，中尼边界协定以及和平友好条约的签订，正确地反映了亚非人民要求团结、合作和和平共处的愿望。
