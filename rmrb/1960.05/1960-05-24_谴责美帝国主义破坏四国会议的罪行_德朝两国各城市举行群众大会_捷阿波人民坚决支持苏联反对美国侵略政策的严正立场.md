Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 22nd - Mass rallies were held in major cities of the German Democratic Republic on the 21st to support the Soviet Union's firm stance in exposing the United States' sabotage of the Four-Power Summit Conference and to condemn the provocative behavior of U.S. imperialism.

　　In Halle, a city with revolutionary traditions and the center of the republic's chemical industry, a mass rally of 200,000 people was held. Ben Knoener, member of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and First Secretary of the Halle District Committee, spoke at the rally. He emphasized that, due to the situation created by U.S. imperialist provocations, the Four-Power Summit Conference could not be held; otherwise, it would be deceiving the people.

　　In Karl-Marx-Stadt, a center of the machinery industry, a mass rally of 40,000 people was held on the 21st. Weiss, alternate member of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and First Secretary of the Karl-Marx-Stadt District Committee, spoke at the meeting.

　　In Cottbus, one of the main lignite producing areas, ten thousand people held a rally with placards reading "Phooey! Eisenhower! Phooey! Adenauer!" and "Shame on the U.S. War Provocations!" Willmann, Secretary General of the German Peace Council, spoke at the rally.

U.S. Imperialism is the Instigator of a New War

　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 23rd - A total of 125,000 people in the North Korean cities of Wonsan, Hyesan, and Sinuiju held rallies today to support the solemn position of the Soviet government and condemn the U.S. imperialist crime of sabotaging the Four-Power Summit Conference.

　　At the mass rally of more than 65,000 people in Sinuiju City, Son Ja-ryong, Chairman of the Sinuiju City Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, and representatives of workers, youth, and students spoke. They pointed out that the U.S. imperialist crime of sabotaging the Four-Power Summit Conference clearly exposed it as a disruptor of world peace and an instigator of a new war. They unanimously expressed their firm demand that U.S. imperialism, the mortal enemy of the Korean people, must immediately get out of South Korea, Japan, South Vietnam, and other Asian regions.

　　Wonsan City, which earned the title of Hero Port for its heroic resistance against the U.S. imperialist invading forces, held a mass rally today with 35,000 participants. Han Chang-soon, Chairman of the Wonsan City Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, and responsible persons of mass organizations in Kangwon Province spoke at the meeting. They unanimously stated that the U.S. imperialist sabotage of the summit conference, and its attempt to legalize this behavior, is exactly the same as its gangster tactics of violating the armistice agreement in Korea and bringing various weapons into South Korea while shifting the responsibility to the Republic. The Korean people, together with the peace-loving people of the world led by the Soviet Union, will fight to the end for the final crushing of the U.S. imperialist war policy and for lasting world peace. Hyesan City, a mountain town on the southern bank of the Yalu River, also held a mass rally today with 25,000 people to condemn the U.S. imperialist crime of sabotaging the Four-Power Summit Conference. On the 22nd, mass rallies were also held in Kaesong, Chongjin City, and Kanggye City. Representatives of workers and students who spoke at the meetings condemned the U.S. imperialist sabotage of the Four-Power Summit Conference and expressed their firm support for the Soviet Union's just position.

Eisenhower's Attitude Exposes the Hypocrisy of the U.S. Government

　　Xinhua News Agency, Prague - People from all walks of life in Czechoslovakia firmly support Comrade Khrushchev's steadfast position on the issue of holding a Four-Power Summit Conference and angrily condemn the U.S. imperialist behavior of sabotaging the summit conference.

　　The Central Council of Trade Unions of Czechoslovakia, the Writers' Union, the Youth League, the Red Cross, and other mass organizations have sent telegrams to the Soviet Embassy in Czechoslovakia, supporting the Soviet Union's solemn position.

　　In a resolution passed by the workers of the Brno Ball Bearing and Tractor Factory, it was stated that Eisenhower's attitude towards the government summit conference exposed the hypocrisy of U.S. policy.

　　Hans, a worker at the Bratislava Railway Station, pointed out that the U.S. dispatch of spy planes to violate Soviet airspace and Eisenhower's refusal to guarantee that similar acts of aggression would not occur in the future clearly demonstrate the anti-peace conspiracy of the U.S. ruling clique. The bellicose groups in the United States and other imperialist countries should realize that their attempts to provoke a world war will end with the demise of the entire capitalist system.

　　Many industrial and agricultural workers in Czechoslovakia have expressed their determination to work harder to strengthen the socialist camp and strengthen the forces defending peace. Agronomist Burnak said, "We will respond to any imperialist provocation with better work achievements and with practical actions of unremitting struggle."

Provocation and Deceit are the Foundation of Imperialist Policy

　　Xinhua News Agency, 22nd - In Albania, Socialist Labor Hero Ikonomi said at a workers' rally at the Stalin Textile Factory, "We believe that the U.S. imperialist stance on the summit conference shows the world that it does not want peace." Worker Konomi said, "We will be even more vigilant, tirelessly exposing the imperialist provocateurs and their servants, the Belgrade revisionists." Putro, chairman of the Vodica Agricultural Cooperative in the Berat District, said, "The U.S. imperialist despicable act of sabotaging the Paris conference once again illustrates that imperialism is the enemy of peace, and that provocation and deceit are the foundation of imperialist policy."

　　Rilia, a port worker in Durres, said, "Today, all simple people clearly recognize that the American robber gang is talking about 'peace' on one hand, while hiding an ax in its coat." The workers of the Trzotoki state-owned penicillin enterprise near Prague said in a letter of protest, "Today we are all very clear. U.S. President Eisenhower is determined to oppose the interests of the American people and the people of the whole world who yearn for lasting peace."

　　Dorezhar, a lathe operator at the Jan Sverma factory in Brno, said: "It is not possible to talk about peace while holding an ax behind your back, as is the policy pursued by the United States."

　　Xinhua News Agency - In Warsaw, the capital of Poland, and in many factories in Poznan and Opole, party organizations held party meetings with mass participation. The meetings discussed the international situation after the U.S. government's sabotage of the Four-Power Summit Conference and unanimously supported the position of the Soviet government.
