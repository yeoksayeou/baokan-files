Xinhua News Agency, Rabat, 16th. The 16th Casablanca International Exposition closed on the evening of the 15th. After the exposition closed, King Mohammed V of Morocco received the delegations from various countries participating in the exposition at his Rabat Palace. Zhang Tingyu, head of the Chinese delegation, and four other members of the delegation were received.

    Since the opening of this exposition on April 28th, the Chinese Pavilion has been a particularly popular attraction. Crowds of visitors have been coming and going until late at night. During the eighteen days of the exhibition, it was visited by one million people. Some people visited four or five times, and some even more than twenty times.

    During the exhibition, visitors wrote down 7,000 comments in the guestbook with enthusiastic language, praising the Chinese Pavilion and the great achievements made by the Chinese people in socialist construction. One visitor wrote: "The achievements made by China in ten years are amazing. China has changed from an industrially backward country into an industrially developed country." Another visitor wrote in the guestbook: "China is the vanguard of the people of Asia and Africa and a model for all underdeveloped countries." Many visitors pointed out that the reason why China has achieved such great achievements in such a short period of time is due to the superiority of the socialist system and the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong. Some visitors wrote enthusiastically in the guestbook: "Long live the achievements of the Chinese people in all fields!" "Long live Mao Zedong, the outstanding and great teacher of the Chinese people!"

    Some visitors, who had previously been deceived by the slanderous propaganda of imperialism, had always believed that China was a backward and poor country. After visiting the Chinese Pavilion, they said that they would never believe any slanderous propaganda about China from imperialism again. One visitor said in the guestbook: "I think China is a very civilized country. No matter how colonialism propagates, China is still a great country. I wish China will always move forward!"

    Many visitors expressed their gratitude in the guestbook for China's assistance to Morocco in planting tea, for China's aid to the victims of the Agadir earthquake, and for the Chinese people's support for the Algerian people's national independence war. Some visitors left phrases in the guestbook that warmly praised the friendship between the people of China and Morocco and the friendship between the people of China and Algeria.

    During this period, approximately 100,000 people watched the films shown in the Chinese Pavilion. Every film was fully seated, and even the entrance to the film hall was crowded with people. The films "Celebrating Ten Years", "Long Live Youth", and "Lotus Lantern" were particularly popular. After each film screening, many viewers warmly shook hands with the Chinese staff, and some viewers even requested a re-screening.

    The sales department of the Chinese Pavilion was also one of the most popular places, and it was crowded with people every day choosing their favorite goods. They praised the Chinese goods for being inexpensive and of good quality, and praised the beautiful life and wisdom of the Chinese people.

    卡萨布兰卡国际博览会闭幕
    一百万人次参观了中国馆
    观众热情赞扬我国建设成就歌颂中摩人民友谊
    新华社拉巴特16日电　第十六届卡萨布兰卡国际博览会在15日晚上闭幕。摩洛哥国王穆罕默德五世在博览会闭幕以后，在他的拉巴特宫接见了参加博览会的各国代表团。中国代表团团长张廷禹和其它四名团员受到接见。
    自本届博览会4月28日开幕以来，中国馆一直是特别受人欢迎的一个馆。每天观众挤进挤出直到深夜。在展出的十八天中，前往参观的达一百万人次。有些人参观了四、五次，有的竟达二十多次。
    在展出期间，观众用热情的语言在留言簿上写下了七千条意见，赞扬中国馆和中国人民在社会主义建设中所获得的巨大成就。有一位观众留下的意见说：“中国在十年中获得的成就是惊人的，中国从一个工业落后的国家变成了一个工业发达的国家。”另一位观众在留言簿上写道：“中国是亚非各国人民的先锋，是一切不发达国家的榜样。”许多观众指出，中国所以在短短的时间内获得如此巨大成就是由于社会主义制度优越和中国共产党和毛泽东主席领导的英明。有的观众在留言簿上热情地写道：“中国人民在各方面的成就万岁！”、“中国人民卓越的、伟大的导师毛泽东万岁！”
    有些观众过去受帝国主义诽谤宣传的欺骗，一直认为中国是一个落后、贫困的国家。在参观中国馆以后，他们表示将永远不再相信帝国主义对中国的任何诽谤宣传。有一位观众在留言簿上这样说：“我认为，中国是一个非常文明的国家，不论殖民主义怎样宣传，中国仍然是一个伟大的国家，祝中国永远向前迈进！”
    许多观众在留言簿上表示感谢中国帮助摩洛哥种茶，感谢中国对阿加迪地震灾民的援助，感谢中国人民对阿尔及利亚人民民族独立战争的支持。有些观众在留言簿上留下了对中国和摩洛哥两国人民的友谊和中国和阿尔及利亚两国人民的友谊热情颂扬的词句。
    在此期间，大约有十万人观看了中国馆放映的电影。每场电影都是座无虚席，就连放映电影的大厅门口也挤满了人。特别受到欢迎的是“欢庆十年”、“青春万岁”、
  “宝莲灯”等几部影片。每场电影放映结束以后，许多观众热烈地同中国工作人员握手，有些观众还要求重新放映一次。
    中国馆的售货处也是最受欢迎的场所之一，每天都挤满了选择他们所喜爱的商品的人群，他们赞美中国商品价廉物美，称赞中国人民的美好的生活和中国人民的智慧。
