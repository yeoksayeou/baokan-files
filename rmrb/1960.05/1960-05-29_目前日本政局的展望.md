Editorial

    The development of things often goes against what the reactionaries wish. U.S. imperialism and its running dog, Nobusuke Kishi, are finding themselves increasingly isolated and in increasingly difficult circumstances as the national democratic movements of the Japanese and Asian peoples continue to advance victoriously. To escape this situation, they are eager to conclude a U.S.-Japan military alliance, preparing conditions for launching a new large-scale war of aggression in Asia. Therefore, they first launched a vicious attack on the Japanese people, not hesitating to completely tear off the mask of bourgeois democracy, illegally forcing the "passage" of the aggressive U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and unilaterally deciding to extend the Diet session by fifty days. However, the situation in the past week or so shows that the U.S.-Japan reactionaries have not only failed to improve their situation in the slightest, but, on the contrary, their perverse actions have put themselves in a more isolated and difficult position. The Associated Press also had to admit: "The passage of the treaty has put Nobusuke Kishi in the trickiest position of his political career." Following the overthrow of the reactionary rule of Syngman Rhee by the people of South Korea and the overthrow of the traitorous government of Adnan Menderes in Turkey, the Japanese people's struggle to overthrow the reactionary rule of Nobusuke Kishi is developing vigorously.
    The fascist atrocities of the Kishi Nobusuke group in illegally forcing the "passage" of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty have served to educate the Japanese people from the opposite side. It has not only greatly raised the awareness of the Japanese people, but has also created a nationwide surge of anger in Japan against U.S. imperialism and its running dog, Nobusuke Kishi. Since May 20, the Japanese people's struggle has clearly had the following significant characteristics.
    First, because the U.S.-Japan reactionaries have given the Japanese people a vivid lesson in this incident, the Japanese people's struggle to abolish the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, demand Nobusuke Kishi's resignation, and dissolve the Diet is becoming increasingly closely linked with the Japanese people's struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression, against U.S. President Eisenhower's visit to Japan, and demanding that U.S. troops get out of Japan. As the Japanese Communist Party's organ "Akahata" said in an editorial on the 26th denouncing U.S. Ambassador to Japan Douglas MacArthur II for interfering in Japan's internal affairs: "We are convinced that the people's struggle demanding the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke government and the dissolution of the Diet will develop into a huge struggle against U.S. imperialism." This is exactly the case. The nationwide demonstration of two million people in Japan on the 26th, especially the large demonstration of 200,000 people in Tokyo, openly raised slogans against U.S. imperialism. 90,000 workers rushed to the U.S. Embassy, chanting slogans such as "Eisenhower, don't come to Japan," "U.S. soldiers get out," and "Return Okinawa." While opposing the fascist atrocities of the Kishi Nobusuke group, a massive nationwide struggle by the Japanese people against Eisenhower's visit to Japan is rapidly rising.
    Secondly, the result of Kishi Nobusuke once again serving as a negative teacher for the Japanese people has made the fighting spirit of the Japanese patriotic and democratic united front even more vigorous, its steps more unified, and its ranks even larger. On the first day after the incident, Japanese political parties and organizations issued strong statements, resolutely protesting the crimes of the Kishi Nobusuke group. The Japanese "National Council to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty," composed of 140 political parties and organizations, including the Japanese Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, announced that it would rapidly strengthen the united action of the people against the "Security Treaty" and would do its utmost to prepare for a large-scale general strike by workers. The Japanese Communist Party called on all Japanese people to strengthen the struggle until the Kishi Nobusuke government is overthrown, the Diet is dissolved, and the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" is smashed; and pointed out that the real struggle has only just begun. The Japanese Socialist Party's statement said that we do not recognize that the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" has been passed and will reject it forever; we guarantee to fight until final victory. Even the Democratic Socialist Party once issued a statement saying that the House of Representatives' "passage" of the new "Security Treaty" and the resolution to extend the Diet session are invalid. This shows that the atrocities of the Kishi Nobusuke group have added fuel to the fire of the Japanese people's anger, greatly increasing their will and confidence in the struggle.
    In this struggle, it is also very clear that the Japanese people's steps are more consistent and their ranks are more expanded. Various Japanese trade unions have formed a united front in this struggle to overthrow the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." On the 23rd, the Japan Federation of Industrial Organizations, which had previously adopted a passive attitude of not joining the Socialist Party and Sohyo in a joint struggle against the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," decided to focus on demanding Kishi Nobusuke's resignation and the dissolution of the Diet, and opposing Eisenhower's visit to Japan, and to launch a joint struggle with the Socialist Party, the Democratic Socialist Party, Sohyo, the All-Japan Trade Union Congress, and the Federation of Neutral Trade Unions. On the 25th, the grass-roots members of various trade unions affiliated with the All-Japan Trade Union Congress, which had refused to accept Sohyo's proposal to take joint action against the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," took noteworthy action to support joint struggles with Sohyo; 800,000 workers held workplace rallies across the country demanding the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke government and the dissolution of the Diet. On the other hand, an increasing number of strata are participating in the struggle. The Japanese Christians against the ratification of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" issued a statement on the 21st, refusing to recognize the new "Security Treaty" forcibly "passed" by the Kishi Nobusuke group, and demanding the resignation en masse of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet and the dissolution of the Diet. On the 24th, 1,500 professors from 20 universities including Tokyo, Waseda, Hosei, and Meiji, scholars from 10 research organizations such as the Atomic Nucleus Research Institute, and cultural figures held a demonstration in the streets of Tokyo and issued a statement pledging to make every effort to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke government, dissolve the Diet, and prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty." This action was the largest demonstration of university professors against the new "Security Treaty." The next day, 15,000 women in Tokyo held a demonstration, chanting: "Don't let our children, husbands, and relatives be thrown into war again!" "Down with the Kishi Nobusuke government!" "Abolish the Security Treaty!" On the 26th, 300 farmers from various prefectures in Japan demonstrated at the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo, opposing Eisenhower's visit to Japan and submitting a letter of protest. Many shops in Gunma Prefecture also held a half-day strike on the 26th to protest the Kishi Nobusuke government's illegal forced "passage" of the new "Security Treaty." The above are all unusual phenomena, indicating that after this incident, the Japanese people's patriotic and democratic united front has been further consolidated and expanded. This will be the most important source of strength for the Japanese people to overthrow the traitorous Kishi Nobusuke government.
    Finally, in a situation where the whole nation is united in opposing the fascist atrocities of the Kishi Nobusuke group, Japanese public opinion, including newspapers representing the Japanese big bourgeoisie, is also unanimously condemning Kishi Nobusuke's atrocities. Japan's three major bourgeois newspapers all published editorials on the 20th. "Asahi Shimbun" said that Kishi Nobusuke's use of such undue coercive measures should be strongly condemned. "Yomiuri Shimbun" said that the treaty was passed at a time when the Japanese people had many doubts and anxieties about it, and there could be nothing more unfortunate for the Japanese nation and people. "Mainichi Shimbun" condemned the Kishi Nobusuke group's actions as indisputable tyranny. Japan's "Asahi Shimbun," "Mainichi Shimbun," "Yomiuri Shimbun," and "Tokyo Shimbun" and other major bourgeois newspapers also published commentaries on the 21st unanimously strongly demanding the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet and the dissolution of the Diet. In order to refute Kishi Nobusuke's absurd remarks on the 21st that newspapers and radio cannot represent public opinion, "Asahi Shimbun" published a special feature on the 26th entitled "Isn't This Public Opinion?", pointing out that according to the statistics of the Japan Newspaper Publishers & Editors Association, from the 21st to the 23rd, 49 local newspapers published editorials, of which 33 strongly demanded the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke government and the dissolution of the Diet. In addition to editorials, various newspapers also published special news and letters from readers, criticizing Kishi Nobusuke's atrocities. Not a single newspaper expressed agreement with the chaotic state of the Diet.
    As the Japanese people's anti-U.S. and anti-Kishi Nobusuke struggle further rises, the Japanese ruling group and the U.S.-Japan reactionaries have also undergone important changes. First, the tide of opposition to Kishi Nobusuke within the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party is rapidly developing. According to a report in the "Asahi Shimbun" on the 19th, representatives of six of the ruling party's eight factions held a meeting on the evening of the 18th to jointly discuss how to remove Kishi Nobusuke from power. The six factions are: the Miki-Matsumura faction, the Ishibashi faction, the Ishii faction, the Kono faction, the Ohno faction, and the Ikeda Faction. The only factions that did not attend this meeting were the Kishi Nobusuke faction and the Sato faction, headed by Kishi Nobusuke's younger brother Eisaku Sato. After the incident on the 19th, many people within the Liberal Democratic Party criticized Kishi Nobusuke. Former Japanese Prime Minister Tanzan Ishibashi issued a statement on the 20th demanding Kishi Nobusuke's resignation. He expressed "great dissatisfaction" with Kishi Nobusuke's introduction of police into the Diet to force the House of Representatives to pass the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. People in the Miki-Matsumura faction also expressed "severe criticism" of Kishi Nobusuke's tyrannical behavior. The Kono faction held a meeting on the afternoon of the 20th, and some people strongly demanded Kishi Nobusuke's resignation. On the evening of the 26th, these six factions met again, and many people believed that Kishi Nobusuke should resign in order to clean up the situation, otherwise the Liberal Democratic Party would lose its election base. Kishi Nobusuke's own isolation is one of the conditions for accelerating his downfall. Of course, there are two situations in the anti-Kishi movement within the Japanese ruling party. One situation shows that enlightened people within the Liberal Democratic Party are deeply dissatisfied with the Kishi government from the standpoint of opposing Kishi Nobusuke's one-sided alignment with the United States; another situation shows that some people are trying to take advantage of the Japanese people's dissatisfaction with Kishi Nobusuke to seize power, but no matter what their respective plans are, they are united in the matter of overthrowing Kishi Nobusuke.
    Secondly, the continuous rise of the Japanese people's struggle has caused serious concern and anxiety among U.S. imperialism and Japanese monopoly capital, and part of Japanese monopoly capital is considering using Kishi Nobusuke as a sacrifice to exchange for the establishment of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and to ease the dissatisfaction of the Japanese people. After U.S. Ambassador to Japan Douglas MacArthur II issued an arrogant statement on the 24th interfering in Japan's internal affairs, the U.S. State Department quickly stated, "Ambassador MacArthur did not have time to contact Washington before issuing the statement." U.S. President's Press Secretary Hagerty also said at a press conference held on the 24th that Eisenhower is scheduled to visit Japan on June 19, but this date may be changed, leaving a way out for Eisenhower to possibly postpone his visit to Japan. According to Japan Broadcasting Corporation's radio news, U.S. government officials issued a statement on the 26th, raising the issue of Eisenhower's visit to Japan, saying that if the Japanese government cannot guarantee security, it may be postponed, causing panic in the Kishi Nobusuke group. Kishi Nobusuke held an emergency meeting after the cabinet meeting on the 27th to discuss the issue of Eisenhower's visit to Japan, and on the same day Fujiyama gave a statement to reporters, requesting that Eisenhower visit Japan as scheduled. These show that the U.S.-Japan reactionaries are outwardly strong but inwardly weak in the face of the powerful people. Japan Shortwave Broadcasting Company's radio broadcast on the 26th: "Regarding the question of how to overcome the difficult situation in the chaotic political situation, the attitude of the financial and business circles is almost unanimous, that is, with the approval of the new Security Treaty as a prerequisite, they demand that Prime Minister Kishi step down." It also said: "The anxiety of the financial and business circles seems to be that even if a general election is held now, it cannot be said with certainty that the Liberal Democratic Party will definitely win." This tone reveals the serious anxiety of Japanese monopoly capital about the current Japanese political situation. Therefore, the tactics currently adopted by U.S. imperialism and Japanese monopoly capital are to defend the two lines of avoiding the dissolution of the Diet and the establishment of the U.S.-Japan military alliance with all means after retreating from the front line of replacing Kishi Nobusuke. The current struggle being waged by the Japanese people is constantly opening up gaps in the U.S.-Japan reactionaries' defense line.
    Finally, the Kishi Nobusuke group continues to make frantic struggles, attempting to continue to maintain its rule by using both soft and hard tactics, and is unwilling to automatically withdraw from the political stage. However, the facts of the past week or so show that this struggle of the Kishi Nobusuke group has not had any effect. After the 20th, because the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and even the Democratic Socialist Party members boycotted the Diet and did not attend any meetings, the Diet was in an extremely abnormal so-called "blank state." In order to save this situation, the Kishi Nobusuke group basely used the recent tsunami disaster in Japan as an excuse to demand that the opposition parties participate in the Diet meetings. The opposition parties exposed this conspiracy and resolutely refused it. Finally, the Kishi Nobusuke group once again used fascist means to forcibly and illegally "pass" the resolution to extend the Diet session by fifty days in the absence of Socialist Party, Communist Party, Democratic Socialist Party, and non-partisan members. The ferocious face of the Kishi Nobusuke group was once again exposed to the Japanese people. Now the Socialist Party has decided to let its members return to the electoral districts to launch a mass movement demanding Kishi Nobusuke's resignation and the dissolution of the Diet, and at the same time stated that it will ultimately not hesitate to force the dissolution of the Diet by resigning all its members. The Kishi Nobusuke group has so far pretended to be calm and repeatedly stated that it will never yield to the people. Kishi Nobusuke said at a cabinet meeting on the 24th: "We must never yield to the forces that are preventing the revision of the Security Treaty," and "We intend to clean up the situation without dissolving the Diet and without a general resignation." Kishi Nobusuke is now making his final struggle.
    Based on the above, the rapid changes in the Japanese political situation in the past week or so show that the Kishi Nobusuke group's forcing the House of Representatives to illegally "pass" the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty is in fact digging its own grave and accelerating its own demise. On the 23rd, "Asahi Shimbun" and other major newspapers estimated that Kishi Nobusuke's downfall is currently only a matter of time. Kishi Nobusuke is entirely likely to follow in the footsteps of Syngman Rhee and Adnan Menderes and head towards a disgraceful path of failure under the contempt of the Japanese people.
    Contrary to the embarrassing situation of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries, the excellent situation for the Japanese people's struggle for independence and peace is coming. The U.S.-Japan reactionaries have repeatedly educated the Japanese people from the opposite side, constantly deepening the Japanese people's understanding of their real enemies—U.S. imperialism and its running dogs—thereby playing a role in mobilizing the vast Japanese people to constantly join the struggle against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs in Japan. Of course, the U.S.-Japan reactionaries will never be reconciled to defeat, and U.S. imperialism will never easily withdraw from Japan, because Japan is the basic strategic base established by U.S. imperialism in the Far East in order to seize world hegemony, and the Japanese reactionaries also urgently need to collude with U.S. imperialism in order to solve the current serious contradiction between production and sales markets and rejoin the struggle of world imperialism for markets and raw material producing areas; therefore, the collusion between the U.S. and Japan reactionaries is closely related to their current vital interests, and the U.S.-Japan military alliance is the embodiment of this spirit. They will never easily give up the U.S.-Japan military alliance, and the Japanese people's struggle will be a long-term, arduous, and constantly repeated struggle. However, the Japanese people's struggle is moving from one victory to another, and gaps in the U.S.-Japan reactionaries' front have been opened. Now the Japanese people are concentrating their efforts to force Kishi Nobusuke to step down, strive to dissolve the Diet, and force the U.S.-Japan reactionaries to make the conspiracy to illegally establish the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty a failure. We firmly believe that in the extremely favorable situation of the nationwide anti-U.S. and anti-Kishi struggle in Japan and the extremely favorable situation of the world people's struggle against U.S. imperialism, as long as the Japanese people continue to make persistent efforts and fight resolutely, the Japanese people will achieve the struggle goal of overthrowing the traitorous government of Kishi Nobusuke and crushing the U.S.-Japan military alliance.

    目前日本政局的展望
    事物的发展往往走向反动派所愿望的反面。美帝国主义及其走狗岸信介，在日本人民和亚洲人民的民族民主运动不断胜利向前发展的情况下，感到自己的处境越来越孤立，越来越困难。为了摆脱这一局面，它们急于缔结日美军事同盟，为在亚洲发动新的大规模的侵略战争准备条件。因此，它们首先向日本人民发动凶恶的进攻，不惜彻底撕毁资产阶级民主的假面具，非法地强行“通过”侵略性的日美军事同盟条约，并单独决定延长国会会期五十天。可是一周多来的情况说明，美日反动派的处境不仅没有丝毫改善，相反的，它们倒行逆施的结果，已使自己处于更孤立、更困难的地位。美联社也不得不承认：“条约的通过，已使岸信介处于他的政治生涯中最棘手的处境。”继南朝鲜人民推翻李承晚反动统治和土耳其曼德列斯卖国政府被推翻以后，日本人民推翻岸信介反动统治的斗争，正在猛烈地向前开展。
    岸信介集团非法强行“通过”日美军事同盟条约的法西斯暴行，起了从反面教育日本人民的作用。它不仅大大提高了日本人民的觉悟，而且使日本出现了一个反对美帝国主义及其走狗岸信介的举国一致的怒潮。5月20日以来，日本人民的斗争显然具有以下显著的特色。
    首先，由于美日反动派在这次事件中使日本人民上了生动的一课，日本人民要求废除日美军事同盟条约、要求岸信介下台和解散国会的斗争，正和日本人民反对美帝国主义侵略、反对美国总统艾森豪威尔访问日本和要求美国军队滚出日本的斗争日益紧密地结合在一起。正如日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”26日在谴责美国驻日大使麦克阿瑟第二干涉日本内政的一篇社论中所说的：“我们确信，要求岸信介政府辞职和解散国会的人民斗争，将发展成为反对美帝国主义的巨大斗争。”事实也正是这样。日本全国二百万群众在26日举行的大示威，尤其是东京二十万人的大示威，公开提出反对美帝国主义的口号。九万工人冲到美国大使馆，高呼“艾森豪威尔，不要到日本来”“美国兵滚回去”“收回冲绳”等口号。在反对岸信介集团法西斯暴行的同时，一个声势浩大的日本人民反对艾森豪威尔访日的全国性的斗争，正在迅速高涨中。
    其次，岸信介再一次充当日本人民的反面教员的结果，使日本爱国民主阵线的斗志更加昂扬，步伐更加一致，队伍更加扩大。在事件发生后的第一天，日本各政党、团体即纷纷发表强硬的声明，坚决抗议岸信介集团的罪行。由日本共产党、社会党、日本工会总评议会等一百四十个政党、团体组成的日本“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”宣布，它将以很快的速度加强人民反对“安全条约”的统一行动，并将竭尽全力为工人举行大规模的总罢工做好准备。日本共产党号召全体日本人民加强斗争，直到推翻岸信介政府、解散国会和粉碎日美“安全条约”为止；并指出，真正的斗争现在还刚开始。日本社会党的声明说，我们不承认新日美“安全条约”已获得通过，并要永远加以拒绝，我们保证将一直斗争到获得最后胜利为止。甚至于民主社会党也曾一度发表声明说，众议院“通过”的新“安全条约”和延长国会会期的决议是无效的。这说明岸信介集团的暴行，使日本人民的怒火有如火上添油，大大地提高了日本人民斗争的意志和信心。
    在这次斗争中，日本人民的步伐更为一致、队伍更为扩大，也是十分明显的。日本各派工会已在这次推翻新日美“安全条约”的斗争中结成统一战线。23日，曾经在反对新日美“安全条约”方面采取不和社会党、总评进行联合斗争的消极态度的日本全国产业别工会会议，决定以要求岸信介辞职和解散国会、反对艾森豪威尔访日这两点为中心，同社会党、民主社会党、总评、全日本工会会议以及中立工会联合会等展开联合斗争。25日，曾经拒绝接受总评提出的为了反对新日美“安全条约”而采取联合行动的建议的全日本工会会议所属各个工会的基层会员，采取了值得注意的行动，来支持同总评进行联合斗争；八十万工人在全国各地举行工作场所大会，要求岸信介政府辞职和解散国会。另一方面，参加斗争的阶层越来越广。日本基督教徒反对批准日美“安全条约”在21日发表声明，不承认岸信介集团强行“通过”的新“安全条约”，并且要求岸信介内阁总辞职和解散国会。24日，日本东京、早稻田、法政、明治等二十个大学的教授和原子核研究所等十个研究团体的学者以及文化界人士等一千五百人，在东京街头举行游行示威，并发表声明，要为打倒岸信介政府、解散国会和阻止批准新“安全条约”而尽一切努力。这次行动，是大学教授们所举行的反对新“安全条约”的规模最大的一次。第二天，东京一万五千名妇女举行游行示威，她们高呼：“不许再把我们的孩子、丈夫和亲人投入战争！”“打倒岸信介政府！”“废除安全条约！”26日，又有来自日本各县的三百名农民，到东京的美国大使馆举行示威，反对艾森豪威尔访问日本，并提交抗议信。群马县的许多商店26日还举行了半天的罢市，抗议岸信介政府非法强行“通过”新“安全条约”。以上列举的都是不寻常的现象，说明了经过这次事件以后，日本人民的爱国民主统一战线取得了进一步的巩固和扩大。这将是日本人民打倒卖国的岸信介政府的最主要的力量源泉。
    最后，在全国人民一致反对岸信介集团法西斯暴行的情况下，包括代表日本大资产阶级的报刊在内的日本舆论界，也同声指责岸信介的暴行。日本著名的三大资产阶级报刊，都在20日发表社论。“朝日新闻”说，岸信介使用了这种不应有的强制手段，是应该受到强烈指责的。“读卖新闻”说，这项条约在日本人民对它怀有许多疑问和不安的情况下被通过，对于日本国家和人民来说，没有比这件事更不幸的了。“每日新闻”谴责岸信介集团的做法是不容争辩的横暴行为。日本的“朝日新闻”、“每日新闻”、“读卖新闻”、“东京新闻”等资产阶级大报，21日还发表评论一致强烈要求岸信介内阁下台和解散国会。为了驳斥岸信介在21日所说的，新闻和广播不能代表舆论的荒谬言论，“朝日新闻”在26日以“难道这不是舆论吗？”为题发表特辑，指出根据日本新闻协会的统计，从21日到23日，有四十九家地方报纸发表社论，其中三十三家报纸强烈要求岸信介政府下台和解散国会。除了社论以外，各家报纸还发表了特辑消息和读者来信，抨击岸信介的暴行。对于国会的混乱状态，连一家表示同意的报纸都没有。
    随着日本人民反美、反岸信介的斗争进一步高涨，日本统治集团和美日反动派内部也发生了重要的变化。首先，日本自由民主党内部反对岸信介的浪潮正在迅速发展。据19日“朝日新闻”报道，在执政党的八个派系中有六个派系的代表18日晚上举行集会，共同商讨如何把岸信介赶下台的问题。这六个派系是三木—松村派、石桥派、石井派、河野派、大野派和池田派。没有参加这次会议的只有岸信介派和以岸信介的胞弟佐藤荣作为首的佐藤派。19日的事件发生以后，自由民主党内部的不少人士，对岸信介进行了指责。日本前首相石桥湛山在20日发表谈话，要求岸信介辞职。他表示对岸信介把警察引进国会，强使众议院通过日美军事同盟条约“非常不满”。三木—松村派的人对岸信介的横暴做法也表示“严厉的批评”。河野派在20日下午开会，有一部分人强烈要求岸信介下台。26日晚上，这六派又再次集会，很多人认为为了收拾局面，应该让岸信介辞职，不然自由民主党将失去选举的地盘。岸信介本身的众叛亲离，是加速岸信介倒台的条件之一。当然，在日本执政党内部的倒岸运动中，存在着两种情况。一种情况说明自由民主党内部的有识之士，从反对岸信介对美国一边倒的立场上对岸政府深怀不满；另一种情况说明有些人企图利用日本人民对岸信介的不满乘机取而代之，但是不论他们各自有什么打算，在打倒岸信介的问题上则是彼此一致的。
    其次，日本人民斗争的不断高涨，使美帝国主义及日本垄断资本对日本的政局产生了严重的忧虑和不安，日本垄断资本的一部分正在考虑以岸信介作为牺牲，来换取日美军事同盟条约的成立和缓和日本人民的不满。24日美国驻日本大使麦克阿瑟第二发表了干涉日本内政的骄横声明以后，美国国务院赶紧表示，“麦克阿瑟大使没有来得及和华盛顿联系就发表了声明。”美国总统新闻秘书哈格蒂，也在24日举行的记者招待会上说，艾森豪威尔预定在6月19日访问日本，但是这个日期也许会有些变动，为艾森豪威尔可能推迟访问日本留下了退路。又据日本广播协会电台消息，美国政府人士在26日发表谈话，提出关于艾森豪威尔访问日本的问题说，如果得不到日本政府关于安全的保证，也许会推迟，引起岸信介集团惊惶失措。岸信介在27日内阁会议结束后曾召开紧急会议，讨论艾森豪威尔访日问题，并在当天由藤山向记者发表谈话，要求艾森豪威尔如期访问日本。这些说明美日反动派在强大的人民面前是外强中干的。日本短波广播公司电台26日广播说：“关于如何渡过处于混乱状态的政局这一难关问题，金融实业界的态度几乎是一致的，这就是以批准新安全条约为前提，要求岸首相下台。”它还说：“金融实业界的不安似乎是，现在即使举行大选，也不能肯定地说，自由民主党一定能够获胜。”这一口吻，流露了日本垄断资本对目前日本政局的严重不安。因此，目前美帝国主义及日本垄断资本采取的战术，就是准备从撤换岸信介这条战线上退却下来以后，以一切手段守住避免解散国会和成立日美军事同盟两条战线。当前日本人民进行的斗争，正在不断打开着美日反动派的防线的缺口。
    最后，岸信介集团继续进行疯狂的挣扎，企图利用软硬并施的办法继续维持自身的统治，不甘心自动退出政治舞台。但是，一周多来的事实说明，岸信介集团这一挣扎并没有什么效果。20日以后，由于社会党、共产党，甚至民主社会党议员抵制国会，不出席任何会议，就使国会处于极不正常的所谓“空白状态”。岸信介集团为了挽救这一局面，卑鄙地利用最近日本遭受的一次海啸灾害为借口，要求在野党参加国会会议。在野党揭露了这一阴谋，并坚决予以拒绝。最后岸信介集团在社会党、共产党、民主社会党和无党派议员未出席的情况下，再一次施用法西斯手段强使参议院非法地“通过”了延长国会会期五十天的决议。岸信介集团的凶恶嘴脸再一次暴露于日本人民之前。现在社会党已决定让议员回到选举区去，展开要求岸信介下台和解散国会的群众运动，同时表示，最后将不惜以全体议员辞职的办法来迫使国会解散。岸信介集团迄今强作镇静，一再表示决不向人民屈服。岸信介在24日内阁会议上说：“对于阻止修改安全条约的力量，绝对不能屈服”，“打算在不解散国会和不实行总辞职的情况下收拾局面。”现在岸信介正在作最后的挣扎。
    根据以上所述，这一周多来日本政局的急剧变化，说明岸信介集团强使众议院非法地“通过”日美军事同盟条约，事实上是自掘坟墓，加速了本身的灭亡。23日“朝日新闻”等各大报纸估计，岸信介的下台目前只是一个时间问题。岸信介完全有可能继李承晚和曼德列斯之后在日本人民的唾弃下走向可耻的失败道路。
    和美日反动派的狼狈处境相反，日本人民争取独立、和平斗争的大好形势正在到来。美日反动派一次又一次地从反面对日本人民进行教育，使日本人民不断地加深对于他们真正的敌人——美帝国主义及其走狗的认识，从而起了动员日本广大人民不断地投入反对美帝国主义及其在日本的走狗的斗争的作用。当然美日反动派决不甘心失败，美帝国主义决不会轻易退出日本，因为日本是美帝国主义为了夺取世界霸权而在远东建立的基本战略基地，日本反动派为了解决目前生产和销售市场间的严重矛盾，也迫切需要同美帝国主义勾结起来，重新加入世界帝国主义争夺市场和原料产地的斗争；因此，美日反动派的勾结是和它们目前的切身利益密切关联着的，日美军事同盟就是这一精神的体现。它们决不会轻易放弃日美军事同盟，日本人民的斗争将是长期的、艰巨的、不断反复的斗争。但是日本人民的斗争正在由一个胜利走向另一个胜利，美日反动派的阵线缺口已经被打开。现在日本人民正在集中力量迫使岸信介倒台，争取解散国会，迫使美日反动派将日美军事同盟条约非法成立的阴谋归于失败。我们坚决相信，在日本全国反美反岸斗争形势十分有利，全世界人民反对美帝国主义的斗争形势十分有利的情况下，日本人民只要再接再厉、坚决斗争下去，日本人民打倒岸信介卖国政府，粉碎日美军事同盟的斗争目标是
  能够实现的。
