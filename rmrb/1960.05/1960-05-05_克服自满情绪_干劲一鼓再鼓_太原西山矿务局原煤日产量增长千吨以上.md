Taiyuan, May 4th (From our newspaper) The workers of the Taiyuan Xishan Mining Bureau have recently criticized and overcome the complacent and relaxed mood of some cadres, and launched a vigorous high-yield campaign, increasing the average daily coal output by more than 1,000 tons compared to the previous level.

The Taiyuan Xishan Mining Bureau had overfulfilled the state's coal production plan for the first quarter by eleven days ahead of schedule. However, in early April, the daily coal output suddenly decreased. After discovering this situation, the Mining Bureau's Party Committee immediately analyzed the reasons for the decline in output. It turned out that some cadres had become complacent and relaxed after overfulfilling the production tasks for the first quarter. The Party Committee believed that to maintain continuous leaps forward, it was necessary to establish a concept of continuous revolution among all employees. To ensure a "red throughout the year" and "red to the end" this year, they proposed the slogan "Strive for April to surpass March, and greet the 'May Day' festival with outstanding achievements" to all employees. At the same time, they launched a mass airing of views, mass debates, and big-character posters among all employees to summarize the experience of overfulfilling the first quarter's plan and identify the reasons for the decline in production. Within two or three days, the movement reached a climax. Workers rushed to write big-character posters before and after work. On the 22nd alone, employees across the bureau posted 5,894 big-character posters, criticizing various forms of complacency and relaxed attitudes. Each mine established rectification groups to address the issues raised by employees, adopting a method of rectifying and correcting simultaneously, so that the problems could be quickly resolved. Within three days, the Ximing Mine summarized 4,457 big-character posters into 457 issues and had already addressed more than 80% of them. The Party Committee secretaries, mine directors, and department personnel of each mine all perked up and went down to the mine to focus on production and participate in labor. The enthusiasm of workers and grassroots management personnel also increased greatly. Pei Yingfu, the production shift director of the Jiaozigou pit, immediately went down to the mine to hold a forum and studied ways to improve production with the workers, which rapidly increased coal output, after examining his own relaxed mood.

In the mass movement of criticizing complacency, relaxing attitudes, and continuing to boost morale, the Xishan Mining Bureau also conducted a profound criticism of erroneous ideas such as technological innovation not being integrated with production, emphasizing self-creation, and not making efforts to promote the experiences of others. After the employees further clarified the purpose of technological innovation, they adopted various methods to summarize and promote the various experiences created in the technological innovation and technological revolution movements, so that more than a dozen innovation projects that had been delayed, such as "excavation coal loaders," "six-zero props," and "four-no work faces," quickly flourished in various mines. The Baijiazhuang No. 2 Well established an innovation task force, reversing the phenomenon of the masses taking action without anyone being specifically responsible. In about a week, it completely installed a hydraulic coal mining face and put it into production. The Guandi Mine used the method of technical competitions to promote non-timbered working faces. In just three days, three coal mining teams and one tunneling team achieved non-timbered working faces, solving the problem of insufficient pit timber, and coal output increased from 2,482 tons to 3,019 tons. The entire Mining Bureau finally overfulfilled the state plan for raw coal production in April and also exceeded the output in March.

### 克服自满情绪　干劲一鼓再鼓  太原西山矿务局原煤日产量增长千吨以上

    克服自满情绪　干劲一鼓再鼓
    太原西山矿务局原煤日产量增长千吨以上
    本报太原4日电　太原西山矿务局所属各矿职工，最近批判和克服了部分干部的自满松劲情绪，大闹高产运动，煤的平均日产量比原来提高了一千吨以上。
    太原西山矿务局曾提前十一天超额完成了首季国家产煤计划。但是，4月上旬煤的日产量突然下降。矿务局党委发现这一情况后，立即分析了产量下降的原因。原来部分干部在超额完成了第一季度生产任务后，产生了自满松劲情绪。党委认为：要持续跃进，必须在全矿职工中树立不断革命的思想。为了保证今年满堂红、红到底，向全体职工提出了“力争4月超3月，用出色的成绩迎接‘五一’节”的口号，同时发动全局职工大鸣大放大辩论，总结超额完成第一季度计划的经验，并找出生产下降的原因来。两三天内，运动就形成了高潮。工人在上班前、下班后，都抢着写大字报。仅在22日一天，全局职工就贴出了五千八百九十四张大字报，批判了各种各样的自满松劲情绪。各矿都成立了整改小组，对职工提出来的问题，采取了边整边改的办法，使问题迅速得到了解决。西铭矿在三天之内，把四千四百五十七张大字报归纳成了四百五十七个问题，并已处理了80％以上。各矿的党委书记、矿长和科室人员都打起精神，到井下抓生产，参加劳动。工人和基层管理人员也干劲倍增。茭子沟坑口生产值班主任裴英芙，检查了自己的松劲情绪以后，马上到井下召开座谈会，和工人一起研究提高生产的办法，使煤产量迅速上升。
    西山矿务局在批判自满松劲情绪、继续鼓干劲的群众运动中，对技术革新不结合生产，强调自己创造，不努力推广别人经验等错误思想也进行了深刻的批判。职工们进一步明确认识了技术革新的目的以后，采取各种办法总结和推广技术革新和技术革命运动中创造的各项经验，使“掘进装煤机”、“六零支柱”、“四无工作面”等十几项迟迟未能实现的革新项目，在各矿迅速开花结果。白家庄二号井成立了革新攻关小组，扭转了群众动手无人负专责的现象后，一个星期左右，把一个水力采煤工作面，完全安装好并且投入生产。官地矿用技术大比武的办法推广无坑木工作面，仅仅三天，就有三个采煤组和一个掘进组实现了无坑木工作面，解决了坑木不足的问题，煤的产量由二千四百八十二吨，提高到了三千零十九吨。全矿务局4月份原煤产量终于超额完成了国家计划，同时超过了3月份的产量。
