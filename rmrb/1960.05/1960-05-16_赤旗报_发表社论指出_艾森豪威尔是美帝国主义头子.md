"Akahata" Publishes Editorial Pointing Out Eisenhower is Head of US Imperialism
　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 13th: The Japanese Communist Party's organ, "Akahata," today published an editorial condemning U.S. President Eisenhower's statement defending U.S. espionage activities. It stated, "It is very clear that President Eisenhower himself is the head of the U.S. imperialists, and he is not an embodiment of peace."
　　The editorial pointed out that the Kishi Nobusuke government is preparing to welcome Eisenhower on a large scale, attempting to use so-called "Japan-U.S. friendship" to deceive the Japanese people in order to forcefully pass the aggressive treaty through the Diet. The editorial called out, "The Japanese people must resolutely oppose Eisenhower's visit to Japan, because this visit is an insult to the Japanese people."
　　"Akahata" then condemned the Kishi Nobusuke government for supporting the U.S. government's robber-like attitude. It said that Japanese Foreign Minister Fujiyama Aiichiro's recent speech indicated that the Kishi Nobusuke government is prepared, in the spirit of the aggressive military treaty, to voluntarily cooperate with the U.S.'s criminal activities. "Akahata" called on the people who oppose the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" to strongly protest the shameless behavior of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries.

    “赤旗报”发表社论指出
    艾森豪威尔是美帝国主义头子
    据新华社13日讯  东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”今天发表社论谴责美国总统艾森豪威尔为美国间谍活动辩解的声明。它说，“很明显艾森豪威尔总统本人是美帝国主义者的头子，他不是和平的化身”。
    社论指出，岸信介政府正在准备大规模地欢迎艾森豪威尔，妄图利用所谓“日美友谊”来欺骗日本人民，以便达到强使国会通过侵略性的条约的目的。社论号召：“日本人民必须坚决地反对艾森豪威尔到日本访问，因为这次访问是对日本人民的侮辱”。
    “赤旗报”接着谴责岸信介政府支持美国政府的强盗态度。它说，日本外务相藤山爱一郎在最近的讲话中表明，岸信介政府准备本着侵略性的军事条约的精神，同美国的犯罪活动进行自愿的合作。“赤旗报”号召反对新日美“安全条约”的人民强烈抗议美日反动派的无耻行为。
