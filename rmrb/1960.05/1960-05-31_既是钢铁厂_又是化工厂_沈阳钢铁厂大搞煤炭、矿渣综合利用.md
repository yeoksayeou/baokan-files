The Shenyang Steel Plant is vigorously developing comprehensive utilization, focusing on coal, producing both steel and chemical raw materials, chemical fertilizers, and building materials. In just over a month, they extracted twenty-eight kinds of chemical raw materials such as light benzene and toluene from coal tar. They also produced more than 800 tons of chemical fertilizer and 140 tons of cement from slag, powerfully supporting the sustained Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production.

This plant began to vigorously engage in diversified operations in April of this year. They first started with the comprehensive utilization of coal tar, launching a coal tar "treasure hunt" campaign. In one month, they extracted middle oil, heavy oil, wash oil, anthracene oil, and light oil from coal tar. After refining these oils, they further extracted chemical raw materials such as light benzene, toluene, diesel, refined benzene, power benzene, phenol, naphthalene, and carbon black. During the campaign, they closely integrated trial production with actual production, immediately putting successful trials into production using indigenous methods. Now, many indigenous kilns and equipment have appeared around the workshops. A newly installed indigenous distillation unit next to the coking workshop can produce five products—middle oil, heavy oil, wash oil, anthracene oil, and light oil—on one set of equipment by heating the coal tar to different boiling points. A square-shaped indigenous muffle kiln can manufacture the raw material for rayon, "sublimed naphthalene," and another long, horizontal kiln can produce hard carbon black, an important raw material for the rubber industry.

    既是钢铁厂　又是化工厂
    沈阳钢铁厂大搞煤炭、矿渣综合利用
    本报讯　沈阳市钢铁厂大力开展以煤炭为重点的综合利用，既生产钢铁，又生产化工原料、化学肥料和建筑材料。一个多月内，从焦油中提取出轻苯、甲苯等二十八种化工原料；用炉渣生产出八百多吨化学肥料和一百四十多吨水泥，有力地支援了工农业生产的持续大跃进。
    这个厂是从今年4月开始大搞多种经营的。他们首先从煤焦油综合利用入手，大搞焦油探宝运动。一个月中，他们从焦油中提取了中油、重油、洗油、轻油、蒽油。把这些油精制以后，又提取了轻苯、甲苯、柴油、精苯、动力苯、酚、萘、炭黑等化工原料。在运动中，他们把试制和生产紧密结合起来，试制成的立刻采取土法上马投入生产。现在，各个车间周围出现了很多土窑、土设备。在焦化车间旁边新装起的一套土蒸馏设备，把焦油加热到不同沸点时，就可在一套设备上，生产出中油、重油、洗油、蒽油、轻油五种产品。一座方型的土闷窑，可以制造人造纤维原料“升华萘”，另一座长型卧式窑，可以生产橡胶工业重要原料硬质炭黑。
