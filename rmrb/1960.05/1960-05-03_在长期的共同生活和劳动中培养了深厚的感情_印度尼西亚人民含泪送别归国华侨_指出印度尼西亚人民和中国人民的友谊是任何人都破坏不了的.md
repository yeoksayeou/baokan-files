Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 30th—According to news received here from Medan, when displaced and impoverished Overseas Chinese from various parts of North Sumatra were preparing to return to their homeland, the local Indonesian people came to bid them farewell with great sorrow, demonstrating the profound friendship between the broad masses of Indonesian people and the Overseas Chinese.

Many displaced and impoverished Overseas Chinese were previously sent to North Sumatra as collateral. They made tremendous contributions to the development of North Sumatra. Today, many thriving plantations there were opened up by them through hardship, bloodshed, and sweat. Many vegetable gardens and fields were cultivated and irrigated by them. Now, they are either dismissed not because of old age or weakness but because they are prohibited from engaging in petty business, thus losing their livelihoods. For a long time, they have lived and worked with the Indonesian people. The Indonesian people expressed great sympathy for their plight. When they gathered in Medan waiting for ships sent by the Chinese government to transport them back to China, many Indonesian farmers and workers went to help them pack their luggage and gave them refreshments. In some places, meetings were held to see them off. In Siantar, Binjai, and other places, the Indonesia-China Friendship Association and Indonesian farmers and workers warmly sent them off. In Gunung Bayu Village, Indonesian plantation workers held a gathering to bid farewell to unemployed Overseas Chinese workers who were about to return to China. At the meeting, Indonesian workers spoke one after another, expressing their gratitude for the contributions made by the Overseas Chinese workers to the prosperity of Indonesia.

A foreman named Sukiran, holding the hand of an Overseas Chinese worker, said, "We have been together for a long time, and many young Indonesian workers are your apprentices. We really don't want to be separated from you." When the unemployed Overseas Chinese workers were about to get on the bus, Sukiran hugged a worker named A Wang, shedding tears. Some people hugged the Overseas Chinese workers and sobbed silently.

The Indonesia-China Friendship Association in Binjai sent eight representatives to see off the Overseas Chinese who were about to return to China. Anwar Nurdin, a representative of the association, said that the Indonesian and Chinese people have always gotten along very well. The departure of Chinese friends made them very sad, and they felt as if they had lost their right and left hands. He hoped that when the Overseas Chinese returned to China, they would always remember this friendship.

The Indonesia-China Friendship Association in Medan and Siantar, and women in Medan, visited the Overseas Chinese gathered in Medan waiting to return home. Salleh Umar, chairman of the Indonesia-China Friendship Association in Medan, led a delegation with gifts to visit the Overseas Chinese living in the reception center. He said to the Overseas Chinese waiting for the ship that the deep friendship between the Indonesian and Chinese people could not be undermined by anyone.

Umbas Subroto, chairman of the Indonesia-China Friendship Association in Siantar, his wife, and the vice-chairman rushed from Siantar to Medan on April 18 to visit the displaced and impoverished Overseas Chinese waiting for ships in Medan, and brought them fruits such as bananas and oranges.

Subroto and his party said that the Overseas Chinese have made tremendous contributions to the development of Indonesia and its struggle for national independence. The broad masses of Indonesian people are friendly to them. They sincerely hope that they have a safe journey.

On the 24th, six Indonesian women representatives from Medan visited the Overseas Chinese reception center to visit the Overseas Chinese waiting for ships to return home. A woman representative named Rumiati said that the Indonesian people have lived with the Overseas Chinese for a long time, and there is a deep friendship between them, so they are saddened by the forced departure of the Overseas Chinese. They expressed their belief that when the Overseas Chinese return to their liberated homeland, they will actively participate in socialist construction, and the achievements of socialist countries will also benefit Indonesia. Her words were warmly welcomed. The displaced and impoverished Overseas Chinese shouted "Long live the friendship between Indonesia and China" in Chinese and Indonesian.

    在长期的共同生活和劳动中培养了深厚的感情
    印度尼西亚人民含泪送别归国华侨
    指出印度尼西亚人民和中国人民的友谊是任何人都破坏不了的
    新华社雅加达30日电　据这里得到的棉兰消息说，北苏门答腊各地流离失所和贫困的华侨在准备动身回国的时候，当地的印度尼西亚人民伤心地前来同他们告别，这表明了广大印度尼西亚人民和华侨之间深厚的友谊。
    许多流离失所和贫困的华侨过去是被作为抵押品送到北苏门答腊去的。他们对北苏门答腊的发展作出了巨大的贡献。今天那里许多欣欣向荣的种植场是他们过去经历千辛万苦、流血流汗开辟出来的。不少菜园和田地是他们耕种和灌溉过的。而现在，他们不是由于年老体弱而遭解雇就是由于被禁止做小生意而丧失了生计。长期以来，他们一直同印度尼西亚人民一起生活和劳动。印度尼西亚人民对于他们的遭遇表示很大的同情。当他们聚集在棉兰等候中国政府派来的船只载运他们回国的时候，许多印度尼西亚农民和工人前往帮助他们捆行李，赠送他们茶点；在一些地方，还举行会议给他们送行。在先达、民礼等地，印度尼西亚—中国友好协会和印度尼西亚农民和工人热情地给他们送行。在古农巴尤尔村，印度尼西亚种植场工人集会，给将要回国的失业华侨工人饯行。在会上，印度尼西亚工人一个接一个地发言，表示感激华侨工人对印度尼西亚的繁荣昌盛所作出的贡献。
    一个名叫苏基兰的领班紧握着一个华侨工人的手说，“我们相处一起的时间很长了，许多年青的印度尼西亚工人是你的学徒。我们的确不愿意同你分离”。在失业的华侨工人即将上车的时候，苏基兰拥抱了一个名叫阿王的工人，流下了眼泪，有些人同华侨工人拥抱和无声地啜泣。
    在民礼地方的印度尼西亚—中国友好协会派了八位代表给即将回中国的华侨送行。协会代表安瓦尔·努丁讲话说，印度尼西亚人民和中国人民一直非常友好地相处。中国朋友的离开使他们非常难过，他们觉得仿佛失去了左右手。他希望，华侨们在回到中国时将永远记得这种友谊。
    棉兰和先达的印度尼西亚—中国友好协会和棉兰的妇女访问了聚集在棉兰候船返国的华侨。棉兰的印度尼西亚—中国友好协会主席萨勒·乌马尔率领代表团带着礼物，访问了住在接待站的华侨。他对候船的华侨说，印度尼西亚人民和中国人民之间的深厚友谊是任何人都破坏不了的。
    先达的印度尼西亚—中国友好协会主席温巴斯·苏布罗托同他的妻子以及副主席4月18日匆匆从先达赶到棉兰访问在棉兰候船的流离失所的和贫困的华侨，并且带给他们香蕉、橘子等水果。
    苏布罗托和他的一行人说，华侨对印度尼西亚的发展和它争取民族独立的斗争作出了巨大的贡献。印度尼西亚广大人民是同他们友好的。他们真诚希望他们一路平安。
    24日，棉兰的六位印度尼西亚妇女代表来到华侨接待站访问那里等候船只回国的华侨，一个名叫鲁米亚提的妇女代表说，印度尼西亚人民长期以来一直同华侨生活在一起，他们之间有深厚的友谊，因此他们对于华侨被迫离开感到难过。她们表示相信，华侨回到解放了的祖国的时候，将积极参加社会主义建设，社会主义国家的成就也将对印度尼西亚有利。她的话受到了热烈欢迎。流离失所和贫困的华侨用中国话和印度尼西亚话高呼“印度尼西亚和中国的友谊万岁”。
