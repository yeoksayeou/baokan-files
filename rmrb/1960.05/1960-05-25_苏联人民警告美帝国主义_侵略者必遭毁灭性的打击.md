Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 24th: Laboring people and armed forces throughout the Soviet Union have recently held rallies to support the Soviet government's firm stance against the United States' provocative policies and to angrily denounce the U.S. imperialists' criminal acts.

    At a meeting of representatives from all walks of life in Kiev, construction worker Yagola expressed the Ukrainian workers' anger at the U.S. imperialists' provocative and aggressive policies. He said, "We workers are extremely indignant at the U.S. war-mongers' vile and shameless acts of aggression. We warn the U.S. imperialists: you should immediately stop playing with fire!" Yagola said that the Soviet people unanimously support the Soviet government's foreign policy and believe that the United Nations Security Council should make a just resolution on the U.S. imperialists' acts of aggression. He said that the Ukrainian working people will do everything possible to consolidate the motherland's national defense.
    Kiev railway worker Klavzov said at the meeting that the people of the world will never forgive Eisenhower, Herter, and others for their crimes of aggression against the Soviet Union and sabotaging the Four-Power Summit Conference. The Soviet people will spare no effort to contribute everything to consolidating the motherland's economy and national defense.
    Ukrainian writer Kotyuk also said at the meeting that the true face of U.S. imperialism has been exposed before the people of the world. The people of the world should be vigilant against the U.S. imperialists' conspiracies to create war and further strengthen the struggle to defend peace.
    Workers at the Tbilisi Machine Factory in Georgia also held a rally. Worker Kovalenko of this factory said that the Soviet people will not allow anyone to invade Soviet territory. Let the U.S. aggressors remember that on Soviet soil, they can only receive severe punishment and nothing else.
    Officers and soldiers of an air force unit in the Transcaucasian Military District angrily condemned the provocative actions of the reactionary forces headed by U.S. imperialism at a rally. Captain Belozorov said that the U.S. imperialists' dirty provocative actions can only arouse people's hatred. They cannot scare us in the slightest. We have never forgotten that the imperialists can do anything despicable. We have not relaxed our vigilance, but are constantly paying attention to strengthening combat readiness. In the resolution of the rally, the officers and soldiers expressed their warm support for Khrushchev's statement in Paris and guaranteed to continuously master modern military technology and resolutely strike back at the invading enemy at any time.
    At a rally held on the 23rd by officers and sailors of a destroyer of the Red Banner Baltic Fleet, sailor Yevtushok pointed out that the U.S. imperialists had long been engaged in sabotaging the Four-Power Summit Conference. Reconnaissance aircraft invading Soviet airspace are just one of the crimes of the U.S. war-mongers. The organizers of this crime must be punished as they deserve. Sailor Guniaviyi said that we wholeheartedly support the Soviet government's policy, and those who want to invade our borders and sabotage peace should remember that they cannot escape the punishment they deserve.
    Many workers, farmers, staff, and students have also written letters to newspaper editorial departments, expressing their support for the Soviet government's firm stance and denouncing the U.S. imperialists' provocative activities.
    An engineer named Filippov wrote a letter to the "Moscow Evening News" saying that the U.S. reactionary forces have committed despicable provocative acts and even dare to announce that their planes will continue to invade Soviet airspace in the future. This is not allowed. We will never allow the enemy to invade Soviet skies. Anyone who dares to invade again will be courting death.
    A casting tool worker said that the policy of the U.S. aggressors can only arouse people's anger and condemnation. We have struck the "uninvited guests," and we will continue to strike them in the future.
Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 24th: The central Soviet newspapers today continued to publish editorials condemning the U.S. imperialists for sabotaging the Four-Power Summit Conference, calling on the Soviet people and the people of all countries to heighten their vigilance and strengthen the struggle against U.S. imperialism.

    "Pravda" published an editorial saying: The Soviet people should be prepared to give the aggressors a devastating blow at any time. The Soviet people must heighten their revolutionary vigilance to deal with the provocations of the enemies of peace and socialism.
    The editorial said that at mass rallies held in large cities and villages across the country, the Soviet people unanimously approved the Soviet government's position taken in Paris. The Soviet people strongly condemned the American aggressors who sabotaged the summit conference.
    "Red Star" said in an editorial that the faces of the American aggressors have been exposed. The myth about Washington's "love of peace" has been shattered, and the lie that the U.S. military bases in foreign territories are defensive bases has also gone bankrupt. The people of the world now clearly see how great a threat U.S. imperialism and its troops and bases pose to the people of the world.
    The editorial said that the people of the world cannot but pay attention to the current military hysteria in the United States. This behavior cannot intimidate the Soviet Union, but should increase vigilance. The task of the Soviet army is to further consolidate the Soviet Union's national defense capabilities and improve combat technology.
    "Labor Daily's" editorial pointed out that in recent days, the working people in every corner of the world have angrily condemned the provocative actions of the U.S. ruling circles that sabotaged the summit conference.
    The editorial said that the mask of the "Cold War" guardians of philanthropists has been torn off. The people of the world firmly believe that the forces of peace will surely defeat the forces of war.

    外高加索军区某空军部队官兵在集会上愤怒谴责以美帝国主义为首的反动势力的挑衅行动。上尉别洛兹罗夫说，美帝国主义者肮脏的挑衅行动只能引起人们的憎恶。他们丝毫也吓不了我们，我们从来也没有忘记帝国主义者会干出一切卑鄙的勾当。我们没有放松自己的警惕，而是时刻都在注意加强战斗准备。官兵们在集会的决议中表示热烈支持赫鲁晓夫在巴黎所发表的声明，并保证不断地掌握现代军事技术，随时给予来犯的敌人以坚决的回击。
