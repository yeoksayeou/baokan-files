    U.S. imperialism's continuous and unbridled aggression and provocations against our country thoroughly expose its evil face of being an enemy of the Chinese people and undermining world peace. The U.S. ruling clique must bear all the consequences.
    Xinhua News Agency, May 26th: At 20:22 to 23:15 on the 25th, a U.S. warship intruded into the sea area of ​​Dongyin, Fujian Province. Regarding this military provocation by the U.S. warship, the spokesperson of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs was ordered to issue the one hundredth serious warning.
    Xinhua News Agency, May 26th: Our reporter reports: On the 25th, U.S. imperialism again sent warships to intrude into our country's territorial waters. The spokesperson of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs was ordered to issue another serious warning to the U.S. government. This is the one hundredth warning issued by our government in one year and eight months. These one hundred serious warnings all refer to the U.S. imperialist aggression of infringing upon our country's sovereignty by openly dispatching aircraft and warships to intrude into our country's airspace and territorial waters, and carrying out military provocations against the 650 million Chinese people. The evidence is complete and undeniable.
    Since September 7, 1958, when four U.S. warships intruded into the inland sea area within 12 nautical miles of Jinmen and Xiamen in Fujian Province, leading the spokesperson of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs to issue the first serious warning, during the one year and eight months until now, American bandits have sent warships to intrude into our country's territorial waters 88 times, with a total of 181 invading warships. During the same period, American bandit aircraft intruded into our country's airspace a total of 68 batches and 242 sorties.
    It can be seen from this that the number of intrusions by U.S. ships and aircraft is far greater than the number of warnings issued by our government. Secondly, the U.S. imperialists' unscrupulous and evil activities of infringing upon our country's territorial waters and airspace are extremely infuriating. The notorious U-2 U.S. strategic reconnaissance aircraft has repeatedly invaded our country's airspace to carry out espionage and reconnaissance activities. For example, on December 6, 1958, a U.S. U-2 strategic reconnaissance aircraft took off from Okinawa and invaded the airspace over our country's coastal areas, then sneaked through Zhejiang and into the airspace over Nanchang and Zhangshu in Jiangxi Province, penetrating as far as more than 730 kilometers into our country's inland airspace. In recent intrusions into our Xisha Islands, U.S. bandit aircraft sometimes flew so low that they were only two or three hundred meters above the ground. The peaceful residents on the island could even see the American pilots in the aircraft with their naked eyes.
    Despite the continuous warnings from our government, the American bandits have not only shown no restraint, but have also publicly clamored to continue their bandit behavior. On April 3, Smott, commander of the U.S. forces in Taiwan, openly clamored that "the U.S. Seventh Fleet has ordered not to change patrol routes because of warnings from people in Peiping (referring to the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China)." This means that they will continue to infringe upon our territorial waters and continue to carry out military provocations and threats against our people.
    U.S. imperialism's continuous and unbridled acts of aggression and provocation by infringing upon our country's territorial waters and airspace, as well as their policy of continuing such aggression and provocation, thoroughly expose U.S. imperialism's determination to be an enemy of the Chinese people and to undermine peace in Asia and the world. The Chinese people are keeping a record of these crimes of U.S. imperialism, one by one. Now it has reached one hundred times. The U.S. imperialists must be warned that the Chinese people cannot be bullied, and every debt must be repaid. The longer it is delayed, the heavier the repayment will be. The U.S. ruling clique must bear all the consequences caused by its aggression and provocation against the Chinese people.

    我对美帝国主义提出第一百次警告
    中国人民是不可欺侮的  美国侵略罪行定要清算
    美帝国主义连续不断地肆无忌惮地对我国的侵略和挑衅，彻底暴露了它与中国人民为敌、破坏世界和平的罪恶面目，美国统治集团必须承担一切后果。
    新华社26日讯　25日二十时二十二分至二十三时十五分，美国军舰一艘侵入我福建省东引地区海域。对于美国军舰的这种军事挑衅，我外交部发言人奉命提出第一百次严重警告。
    新华社26日讯　本社记者报道：美帝国主义25日又派遣军舰侵入我国领海，我外交部发言人奉命对美国政府又一次提出严重警告，这次是一年零八个多月以来我国政府提出的第一百次警告。这一百次严重警告，指的都是美国帝国主义侵犯我国主权公然派遣飞机、军舰侵入我国的领空、领海，对六亿五千万中国人民进行军事挑衅的侵略行为，罪证俱在，无可抵赖。
    自从1958年9月7日因美国军舰四艘侵入我国福建省金门、厦门内海地区十二浬以内，受到我外交部发言人提出第一次严重警告起，到现在的一年零八个月的期间，美国强盗派军舰侵入我国领海八十八次，入侵的军舰达一百八十一艘。同一期间，美国强盗飞机共有六十八批、二百四十二架次侵入我国领空。
    由此可见，美舰美机入侵的次数远比我国政府提出警告的次数为多。其次，美帝国主义侵犯我国领海、领空的肆无忌惮的罪恶活动，是极端令人愤慨的。臭名远扬的U—2型美国战略侦察飞机，曾多次侵犯我国领空进行间谍侦察活动。如在1958年12月6日，美国一架U—2型战略侦察飞机从冲绳岛起飞侵入我国沿海地区上空后，还经过浙江窜入我国江西省南昌、樟树一带上空，深入我国内陆上空竟达七百三十多公里。又如最近几次侵入我国西沙群岛的美国强盗飞机竟有时低飞到离地面只有二、三百米的低空，岛上的和平居民甚至用肉眼也能看到飞机上的美国驾驶员。
    尽管我国政府不断提出警告，但是美国强盗不仅毫无收敛，而且还公开扬言要继续他们的强盗行为。4月3日，侵台美军司令斯摩特就公开叫嚣“美国第七舰队下令不要因为北平人（指中华人民共和国外交部发言人）警告而改变巡逻路线。”这就是说他们要继续侵犯我国领海，继续向我国人民进行军事挑衅和威胁。
    美帝国主义连续不断地肆无忌惮地侵犯我国领海领空的侵略和挑衅行为以及他们要继续进行这种侵略和挑衅的政策，彻底地暴露了美帝国主义决心与中国人民为敌、破坏亚洲和世界和平的罪恶面目。中国人民把美帝国主义的这些罪行一笔一笔记在账上。现在已经到了一百次了。必须警告美帝国主义者，中国人民是不可欺侮的，每一笔账都是要偿还的，拖欠愈久，偿还愈重，美国统治集团必须承担它对中国人民进行侵略和挑衅所引起的一切后果。
