Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 15th: The Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party today issued a message to all Korean people in celebration of the 15th anniversary of Korea's liberation on August 15th, calling on all Korean people to struggle more actively for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland and the immediate withdrawal of the American imperialist aggressor troops.

The message points out that Korea, which was still a colonial and semi-feudal society fifteen years ago, has today firmly established an advanced socialist system that the people yearn for and strive for. The industrial output value accounts for 70% of the total industrial and agricultural output value. Under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party, the great Chollima Movement launched by all the people of northern Korea has brought a great upsurge in socialist construction.

The message states that the great achievements of socialist construction in northern Korea have become a powerful force to encourage the people of southern Korea to fight against the colonial rule of American imperialism and illuminate the path of the people of southern Korea.

The message states that the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party warmly supports and supports the people of southern Korea who are engaged in a heroic struggle against the colonial rule of American imperialism. The struggle of the people of southern Korea is a struggle for new politics, a new society, and a new life. It is a just struggle for survival, freedom, and democratic rights. It is a patriotic struggle. The struggle of the people of southern Korea declares to the people of the world that the colonial rule imposed on the people of southern Korea by the American imperialists has gone bankrupt, and it makes the enemy tremble with fear. The traitor Syngman Rhee has been driven off the stage.

The message points out that the great victory achieved in the struggle of the people of southern Korea is only the first step, and the struggle has just begun. The American imperialists continue to occupy southern Korea, and the puppet ruling structure continues to exist. The aggressive foundation of American imperialism - the landlords and comprador capitalists - has not been hit. The "caretaker cabinet" created by American imperialism is only a continuation and remake of the Syngman Rhee puppet regime.

The message says that despite the American imperialists' cunning conspiracies, they will never be able to maintain their crumbling colonial rule. The political and economic crisis in southern Korea is becoming more acute, and the chaotic situation is intensifying. The dissatisfaction of the broad masses of people in southern Korea, including workers, peasants, young students, people in science and culture, entrepreneurs, and merchants, with the American imperialists and their lackeys is growing. As long as American imperialism continues to occupy southern Korea and continues to implement colonial rule, the struggle of the people of southern Korea will continue to strengthen and rise day by day.

The message says that the conditions for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland that all Korean people desire are maturing, and light is already in sight. The message calls on the working people of northern Korea to produce more, build more, accelerate the pace of Chollima, launch labor competitions, continue to move forward, and continue to innovate in order to reunite with their brothers in southern Korea as soon as possible.

The message also calls on the people of southern Korea to shatter the enemy's deceptive methods and not give the enemy a chance to breathe. The message points out that as long as they unite and fight bravely, victory belongs to the people.

The message, after pointing out the specific tasks of the workers, peasants, women, soldiers, and people from all walks of life in southern Korea, says that it is necessary to dismantle the wall across North and South Korea and realize the free movement and economic and cultural exchanges between North and South Korea. It is necessary to form a North-South Joint Economic Committee composed of representatives of the economic circles of North and South Korea and take measures as soon as possible to restore the economy of South Korea and stabilize the lives of the people of South Korea.

The message calls on all the people of southern Korea to unite all their strength, strive to immediately convene a North-South Korean joint conference, formulate a plan for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland as soon as possible, and actively fight for the implementation of free North-South Korean general elections without foreign interference, the establishment of a unified government, and the peaceful reunification of the fatherland.

    朝鲜劳动党为迎接朝鲜解放十五周年发表文告
    号召人民奋起赶走美国侵略军
    朝鲜北部社会主义建设的巨大成就照亮了南朝鲜人民的前进道路。南朝鲜人民的斗争是要求新政治、新社会、新生活的斗争，这个斗争所取得的巨大胜利，还不过是第一步的胜利，斗争还刚刚开始。美帝国主义还继续强占着南朝鲜，傀儡统治机构还继续存在。但是，南朝鲜人民的斗争将继续加强并日益高涨。全体朝鲜人民渴望的和平统一祖国的条件正在成熟，光明已经在望。
    新华社平壤15日电　朝鲜劳动党中央委员会为迎接“八一五”朝鲜解放十五周年，今天发表告全体朝鲜人民书，号召全体朝鲜人民为了祖国的和平统一和使美帝d国主义侵略军立即撤走更加积极地进行斗争。
    告人民书指出，在十五年以前还是一个殖民地半封建社会的朝鲜，今天已经牢固地建立起人民热望并为之奋斗的先进的社会主义制度。在工农业总产值中工业产值已占70％。在朝鲜劳动党领导下，全体朝鲜北部人民掀起的伟大的千里马运动，为社会主义建设带来了大高潮。
    告人民书说，朝鲜北部社会主义建设的巨大成就成为鼓舞南朝鲜人民进行反对美帝国主义殖民统治的斗争的强有力的力量，并且照亮了南朝鲜人民的前进道路。
    告人民书说，朝鲜劳动党中央委员会热烈地支持和声援为反对美帝国主义殖民统治而进行英勇斗争的南朝鲜人民。南朝鲜人民的斗争是要求新政治、新社会、新生活的斗争，是争生存、争自由和民主权利的正义斗争，是爱国的斗争。南朝鲜人民的斗争向全世界人民宣告，美帝国主义者强加在南朝鲜人民身上的殖民统治制度已经破产，并且使敌人心惊胆战。卖国贼李承晚被赶下台了。
    告人民书指出，南朝鲜人民的斗争所取得的巨大胜利，还不过是第一步的胜利，斗争还刚刚开始。美帝国主义者还继续强占着南朝鲜，傀儡统治机构还继续存在，美帝国主义的侵略基础——地主、买办资本家还没有受到打击。美帝国主义制造的“看守内阁”只不过是李承晚傀儡政权的继续和翻版。
    告人民书说，但是，尽管美帝国主义玩弄奸诈的阴谋，也绝无法维持它的摇摇欲坠的殖民统治制度。南朝鲜的政治、经济危机正更加尖锐化，混乱情况也日益加剧。工人、农民、青年学生、科学文化界人士、企业家、商人等南朝鲜广大阶层的人民对美帝国主义者及其走狗的不满在日益增长，只要美帝国主义继续强占着南朝鲜、继续实行殖民统治，南朝鲜人民的斗争就将继续加强并日益高涨。
    告人民书说，全体朝鲜人民渴望的和平统一祖国的条件正在成熟，光明已经在望。告人民书号召朝鲜北部劳动人民为了早日同南朝鲜兄弟欢聚一堂，更多地生产、更多地建设，加快千里马的步伐，展开劳动竞赛，继续前进，继续革新。
    告人民书还号召南朝鲜人民要粉碎敌人的欺骗手法，不要给敌人以喘息的机会。告人民书指出，只要团结起来勇敢斗争，胜利就是人民的。
    告人民书在向南朝鲜的工人、农民、妇女、军人等各界人民指出他们各自的具体任务后说，必须拆除横断南北朝鲜的墙壁，实现南北朝鲜之间的自由来往和经济、文化交流。要求组成由南北朝鲜经济界代表构成的南北联合经济委员会，早日为恢复南朝鲜的经济和安定南朝鲜人民的生活采取措施。
    告人民书号召全体南朝鲜人民把一切力量团结起来，争取立即召开南北朝鲜联席会议，早日制订和平统一祖国的方案，为实施没有外国干涉下的自由的南北朝鲜总选举、成立统一的政府，为争取和平统一祖国而积极斗争。
