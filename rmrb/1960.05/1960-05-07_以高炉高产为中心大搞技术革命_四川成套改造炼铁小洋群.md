Focusing on high blast furnace output, Sichuan is carrying out a technical revolution to completely modernize its small-scale iron smelting clusters.

More than 60% of iron smelting enterprises have basically achieved complete sets of smelting, coal coking, and mining equipment, and formed transportation networks.

Chengdu, May 6th (This newspaper) —Sichuan's iron smelting enterprises, focusing on high output from blast furnaces, are prioritizing the strengthening of mining, coal coking, and transportation links, completely modernizing and comprehensively improving small-scale clusters, leading the iron smelting front's small-scale clusters into a new stage of complete development. Currently, more than 60% of the province's iron smelting enterprises have basically achieved complete sets of smelting, coal coking, and mining small-scale clusters, with transportation networks formed between the three clusters. The degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization has been greatly improved, and production has increased substantially, extensively, and continuously. Since April, the daily output levels in major pig iron producing areas such as Leshan, Mianyang, Daxian Prefecture, and Chongqing have reached and maintained above one thousand or two thousand tons, propelling the province's pig iron production forward at a high speed of over six hundred tons per day, breaking the ten-thousand-ton mark.

Sichuan's small-scale iron smelting clusters are responsible for over 90% of the province's pig iron production. Rapidly and comprehensively improving the production level of small-scale clusters is a major strategic measure to ensure the overall leap forward in the province's national economy. At the beginning of this year, the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee issued a call to the vast number of workers on the iron smelting front, requiring all localities to conduct comprehensive and systematic technical transformation of the production and transportation of blast furnaces, mines, and coal coking, so that each link would adapt to each other, fully tap the production potential of small-scale clusters, and strive to achieve the "four-one" targets in the production of all iron smelting small-scale clusters in the province within the first half of the year (i.e., the utilization coefficient of blast furnaces reaches above one, the sulfur content of pig iron drops below 0.1%, the coke ratio does not exceed one, and the average labor force used for smelting one ton of iron does not exceed one hundred people). According to the existing iron smelting small-scale cluster enterprises in Sichuan Province, if all reach the "four-one" targets, the province can increase pig iron production by at least one thousand tons per day, save about 30% of the labor force, and greatly improve the quality of pig iron and reduce production costs. Responding to the call of the Provincial Party Committee, at the beginning of this year, Party committees at all levels mobilized the vast number of cadres and workers to demonstrate the spirit of running iron and steel in a big way in 1958, establish typical examples at all levels, summarize experience, hold on-site meetings, and leading cadres at all levels took the lead in going deep into the blast furnace, mining, coal mining, coking, and transportation fronts to extensively cultivate "experimental fields," eating, living, and working with the masses, and rapidly guiding the mass movement to a new upsurge. By April, more than 60% of the province's iron smelting enterprises had achieved "complete sets of three clusters and transportation networks," with pig iron production increasing by about 50% compared with the same period last year, and more than 200,000 laborers were transferred from the iron smelting front back to the countryside to strengthen agricultural production. Recently, the average utilization coefficient of blast furnaces in the province exceeded one, and more than one hundred blast furnaces exceeded two.

In the complete technical transformation of Sichuan's small-scale iron smelting clusters, the principle of "using modern methods where possible, using indigenous methods where possible, combining indigenous and modern methods, and gradually improving" was firmly implemented. For the thirty key iron producing counties and eighty-five key iron plants that account for about 70% of the province's modern blast furnace volume, in addition to a batch of blast furnace and mining equipment being rushed out by the mechanical industry departments, various localities adopted the method of combining indigenous and modern methods to carry out technical transformation, and most of them have been completed and put into production. Most enterprises, adhering to the spirit of relying on the masses and self-reliance, combined learning from foreign experience with summarizing mass creativity, and used indigenous methods to vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution. The Emei Lijia Mountain Mining Area, relying on the masses, used local materials to vigorously develop indigenous machinery and equipment, and, adapting to local conditions, vigorously developed wood tracks, aerial cableways, chutes, and trolley roads and other transportation equipment. In just over two months, it achieved semi-mechanization and indigenous automation of ore production and transportation, increasing the average daily output of ore from more than 800 tons to more than 2,600 tons, the daily transportation volume from more than 200 tons to more than 1,300 tons, and saving 28.5% of the total number of employees in the factory.

In order to better integrate the complete modernization of small-scale clusters with production, various localities started with the weakest links that have the greatest impact on current production, driving one link after another, repeatedly transforming, constantly developing, and constantly improving. The Leshan Steel Plant first thoroughly transformed the air supply system and the management of raw materials and fuels to address the key issues of small air volume and low air temperature, realizing high air volume, high temperature, strong pressure, and precise material operation, which rapidly increased the plant's pig iron production. Subsequently, the entire plant experienced shortages of ore and coke, and the plant's Party committee immediately organized forces to carry out a series of transformations and construction in the mining, coal coking, and transportation links, realizing the main shaft of the mine, comprehensively promoting stepped mining and pneumatic drill operation, and constructing a main highway connecting the mine to the furnace clusters and an internal transportation network within the factory, vigorously developing mechanization of ore crushing, forging, and screening, so that the supply of ore and coke met the needs of blast furnace production. Recently, the plant further transformed the blast furnace air supply system, increased the air volume, increased the air temperature, and improved the furnace type and technical management, increasing the average utilization coefficient of blast furnaces in the plant from 1.26 in January to 2.97 in April.

The continuous development of small-scale iron smelting clusters has placed new demands on machine repair capabilities and building materials. In order to ensure the maintenance and repair of "three sets and one network," to ensure the needs of the basic construction of small-scale clusters, and to more fully and rationally utilize national resources, many small-scale cluster enterprises that have already achieved "three clusters complete and transportation network formed" are now further engaging in comprehensive utilization and diversified operations, gradually developing towards the direction of "six clusters complete" (blast furnace, mine, coal coking, machine repair, slag cement, tar chemical industry).

    以高炉高产为中心大搞技术革命
    四川成套改造炼铁小洋群
    百分之六十以上炼铁企业基本实现冶炼、煤焦、矿山成套，运输成网
    本报成都6日电　四川炼铁企业以高炉高产为中心，重点加强矿山、煤焦、运输等环节，成套改造和全面提高小洋群，使炼铁战线小洋群进入了一个成套发展的新阶段。目前，全省60％以上的炼铁企业基本上实现冶炼、煤焦、矿山小洋群三群成套，三群之间运输成网，机械化半机械化程度大大提高，生产大幅度大面积持续上升。4月份以来，乐山、绵阳、达县专区和重庆市等主要生铁产区日产水平都达到并保持在一千吨或二千吨以上，使全省生铁产量以日增六百多吨的高速度向前跃进，并一举突破了万吨大关。
    四川炼铁小洋群担负着全省90％以上的生铁生产任务，迅速全面提高小洋群生产水平，是保证实现全省国民经济全面跃进的一项主要战略措施。今年一开始，四川省委就向炼铁战线的广大职工发出号召，要求各地对高炉、矿山、煤焦的生产和运输进行全面系统的技术改造，使各个环节互相适应，充分挖掘小洋群的生产潜力，力争在上半年内全省所有炼铁小洋群生产都要达到“四一”指标（即高炉利用系数达到一以上，生铁硫分降到0.1％以下，焦比不超过一，炼一吨铁使用劳动力平均不超过一百人）。根据四川省现有炼铁小洋群企业计算，全部达到“四一”指标后，全省每天至少可以增产一千多吨生铁，节约劳动力30％左右，并将大大提高生铁质量，降低生产成本。各级党委响应省委号召，今年一开始就动员广大干部和职工拿出1958年大办钢铁的劲头，层层树立典型，总结经验，召开现场会，各级领导干部带头深入高炉、矿山、采煤、炼焦、运输各条战线广种“试验田”，与群众同吃同住同劳动，把群众运动迅速引向新高潮。到4月份为止，全省炼铁企业中，已有60％以上炼铁、煤焦、矿山小洋群实现了“三群成套，运输成网”，生铁产量比去年同期增长50％左右，并从炼铁战线抽调了二十多万个劳动力回农村加强农业生产。最近全省高炉平均利用系数超过了一，一百多座高炉超过了二。
    四川炼铁小洋群在成套地进行技术改造中，坚决贯彻了能洋则洋，能土则土，土洋结合，逐步提高的方针。对于占全省洋高炉容积70％左右的三十个重点产铁县和八十五个重点铁厂，除已由机械工业部门赶制出一批高炉、矿山等装备以外，各地采取土洋结合的办法，进行技术改造，大部分都已完工投入生产。多数企业则本着依靠群众，自力更生的精神，学习外地经验与总结群众创造相结合，用土办法大闹技术革新与技术革命。峨眉李家山采矿场依靠群众，就地取材，大搞土机械、土设备，并因地制宜，大力发展木轨道、架空索道、溜槽、架车路等运输机具，在短短两个多月之内，就实现了矿石生产、运输半机械化和土自动化，使矿石的平均日产量由八百多吨提高到二千六百多吨，日运量由二百多吨提高到一千三百多吨，并节约了占全厂职工总数28.5％的劳动力。
    为了使小洋群的成套改造与生产结合得更好，各地从影响当前生产最大的薄弱环节着手，一环带动一环，反复改造，不断发展、不断提高。乐山钢铁厂首先针对风量小、风温低的关键彻底改造了送风系统和原料燃料管理，实现了大风、高温、强压、精料操作，使全厂生铁产量迅速上升。接着，全厂出现了矿石、焦炭供应不上的现象，厂党委又立即组织力量对矿山、煤焦、运输等环节进行了一系列的改造和建设，实现了矿山主井化，全面推行了阶梯开采和炮眼机操作，同时修建了矿山连接炉群的公路干线和厂内运输网，大搞碎矿、锻矿、筛矿机械化，使矿石、焦炭的供应满足了高炉生产的需要。最近，这个厂又进一步改造了高炉送风系统，加大了风量，提高了风温，并改进了炉型和技术管理，使全厂高炉平均利用系数由1月份的一点二六提高到4月份的二点九七。
    炼铁小洋群的不断发展，对机修力量、建筑材料等提出了新的要求。为了保证“三套一网”的维护检修，保证小洋群基本建设的需要，并且更充分更合理地利用国家资源，许多已经实现“三群成套，运输成网”的小洋群企业，现在又进一步大搞综合利用，大搞多种经营，逐步向“六群成套”（高炉、矿山、煤焦、机修、矿渣水泥、焦油化工）的方向发展。
