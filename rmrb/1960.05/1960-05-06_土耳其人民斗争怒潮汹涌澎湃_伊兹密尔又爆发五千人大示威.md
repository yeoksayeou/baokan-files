Xinhua News Agency, May 5th—Izmir dispatch: A large-scale demonstration erupted on May 4th in Izmir, a Turkish port city on the Aegean Sea. Five thousand students and residents from other social strata shouted slogans: "Resign! Resign!" (referring to the Menderes government) and "Freedom! Freedom!" This was the first time demonstrators in Izmir had shouted such slogans.

　　This demonstration took place on the eve of the scheduled visit to Izmir by representatives of certain NATO aggressive bloc countries. The city is the location of NATO's Southeast European headquarters.

　　Several hundred students from Aegean University initiated the demonstration. They gathered in the square outside the local governor's office, and many bystanders, including young women, immediately joined their ranks. The demonstrators shouted slogans and sang the national anthem. They resisted attacks by troops wielding batons and bayonets for nearly an hour. Some demonstrators were arrested.

　　In Konya, an ancient Turkish city more than two hundred kilometers south of the capital, Ankara, students from the normal college also prepared to hold a demonstration on May 4th, but they were immediately suppressed by the police. It is reported that the situation in Ankara and Istanbul remains volatile, although the Turkish authorities have imposed martial law there and reinforced their heavy troop deployments.

　　The Istanbul martial law commander ordered the local "New Dawn" newspaper to cease publication for ten days on May 4th because the newspaper prominently published a photograph of professors demonstrating in Seoul, South Korea, against the US-Syngman Rhee clique. This is the eighth publication to be ordered to cease publication by the authorities since the people of Istanbul held demonstrations against the US-backed Menderes regime.

　　In Ankara, seventeen opposition party members of parliament submitted a motion requesting that parliament investigate the government's bloody suppression of demonstrations in Istanbul and Ankara. In a telegram to Menderes, they said, "Your completely unconstitutional regime has forced the people to become angry."

　　Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, May 4th: The Secretariat of the World Federation of Democratic Youth issued a statement on May 4th, firmly supporting the struggle of Turkish youth and students for freedom, democracy, and national independence. The statement said that the reactionary rulers of the Turkish government, with the support of NATO countries, especially US imperialism, have turned Turkey into a large prison. The World Federation of Democratic Youth expresses its indignation at the recent attacks launched by the Turkish reactionaries, with the support of US imperialism, against the youth who are fighting for freedom and democracy. The statement strongly protests this barbaric behavior and demands that the Turkish government immediately release those arrested, respect democratic rights, and abolish martial law.

　　The World Federation of Democratic Youth calls on youth and student organizations in all countries to support the just struggle of Turkish youth and students.

    土耳其人民斗争怒潮汹涌澎湃
    伊兹密尔又爆发五千人大示威
    世界民主青联号召各国青年学生支持土耳其学生的斗争
    新华社5日讯　伊兹密尔消息：爱琴海畔的土耳其港口城市伊兹密尔4日爆发了大规模的示威，五千名学生和其他阶层的居民高呼口号：“辞职！辞职！”（指曼德列斯政府）和“自由！自由！”，伊兹密尔的示威者是第一次呼喊这样的口号。
    这次示威发生在某些北大西洋公约侵略集团国家的代表预定将要访问伊兹密尔的前夕，这个城市是北大西洋公约组织东南欧总部所在地。
    爱琴大学的几百个学生首先开始示威，他们聚集在地方长官公署外边的广场上，许多旁观者，其中包括青年姑娘，马上参加了他们的队伍。示威者高呼口号和高唱国歌。他们抵抗挥动短棍和刺刀的军队的攻击将近一小时之久。有一些示威者被逮捕。
    在位于首都安卡拉南面二百多公里的土耳其古城科尼亚，师范学院的学生们在4日也曾经准备举行示威游行，但是他们立即遭到警察的镇压。据报道，安卡拉和伊斯坦布尔的形势仍然是一触即发的，虽然土耳其当局在那里实施了戒严并且增援重兵把守。
    伊斯坦布尔戒严司令4日命令当地的“新晨报”停刊十天，因为报纸以显著地位刊载了南朝鲜汉城教授示威反对美国—李承晚集团的一张照片。这是自从伊斯坦布尔人民举行反对美国扶植的曼德列斯政权的示威以来被当局勒令停刊的第八个刊物。
    在安卡拉，十七个反对党议员提出动议，要求议会对政府血腥镇压伊斯坦布尔和安卡拉示威的事件进行调查。他们在给曼德列斯的电报中说，“你的完全不合乎宪法的政权迫使人民愤怒起来了。”
    新华社布达佩斯4日电　世界民主青年联盟书记处4日发表声明，坚决支持土耳其青年和学生为争取自由、民主和民族独立的斗争。声明说，土耳其政府的反动统治者在北大西洋集团国家，特别是美帝国主义的支持下，已经把土耳其变成了一个大监狱。世界民主青年联盟对最近土耳其反动势力在美帝国主义支持下，向为争取自由和民主的青年所发动的进攻表示愤慨。声明强烈抗议这种野蛮的行为，并要求土耳其政府立即释放被捕者，尊重民主权利和废除戒严令。
    世界民主青年联盟号召各国的青年和学生组织支持土耳其青年和学生的正义斗争。
