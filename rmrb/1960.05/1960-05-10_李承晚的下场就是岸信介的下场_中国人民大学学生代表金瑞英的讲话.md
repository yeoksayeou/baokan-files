    The flames of the Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance are raging. We, the young students, fully support the heroic struggle of the Japanese people until we drive U.S. imperialism out of Japan and out of Asia.
    In the past, the Chinese people suffered long-term oppression and enslavement by imperialism. U.S. imperialism and Japanese imperialism ran rampant on Chinese soil, committing heinous crimes of rape, arson, and murder, bringing countless disasters to the Chinese people. How many parents were slaughtered! How many sisters were ravished! How many young people were destroyed! The bloody hatred is still fresh in the memory of the Chinese people, and we will never forget it! The Chinese youth, who have stood up, are determined, together with the people of the whole country, not to allow imperialism to invade our land by an inch or touch a single hair on our heads.
    Now, Eisenhower has again colluded with Kishi Nobusuke to conclude the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, revive Japanese militarism, and direct the spearhead of aggression at China, the Soviet Union, and the peace-loving people of Asian countries, dragging the Japanese people back into the abyss of disaster. This once again proves with iron facts that U.S. imperialism is the mortal enemy of the Chinese people, the mortal enemy of the Japanese people, the mortal enemy of all people who demand national independence, and the mortal enemy of all peace-loving people in Asia and the world. To win national independence, to win true and lasting peace, there is only one way: to overthrow U.S. imperialism. There is only one way out, and only one method. Now, the oppressed nations are increasingly recognizing the true face of U.S. imperialism, and the volcanoes under the feet of imperialism are erupting one after another. The people of South Korea and Turkey have ignited the flames of anti-imperialist and patriotic struggle, and the Japanese people have launched a magnificent and unstoppable wave of struggle. Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. Batons, tear gas, bullets, shells, tanks, and all kinds of deceptive tricks cannot save them from their doomed fate. Imperialism will be smashed to pieces by the iron fists of the people's revolution. Syngman Rhee's fate will be the fate of Kishi Nobusuke and all reactionaries. The people are the masters of history, and final victory will surely belong to the people of Japan and the world!
    Oppose the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty!
    Oppose the revival of Japanese militarism!
    Yankee Get out of Japan!
    Get out of South Korea! Get out of South Vietnam Get out of Turkey!
    Get out of Philippines! Get out of our territory Taiwan!
    Down with U.S. imperialism!

### 李承晚的下场就是岸信介的下场  中国人民大学学生代表金瑞英的讲话

    李承晚的下场就是岸信介的下场
    中国人民大学学生代表金瑞英的讲话同志们：
    日本人民反对日美军事同盟的斗争烈火燃烧起来了。我们青年学生全力支持日本人民的英勇斗争，一直到把美帝国主义从日本赶出去，从亚洲赶出去。
    中国人民过去长期遭受帝国主义的压迫和奴役，美帝国主义、日本帝国主义都曾在中国的土地上横行霸道，奸淫烧杀，犯下了滔天的罪行，给中国人民带来了无数的灾难。有多少父母被屠杀！有多少姐妹被蹂躏！有多少青年被摧残！血海深仇，中国人民记忆犹新，我们永远不会忘记！站起来的中国青年，坚决和全国人民一道，不准帝国主义再侵犯我们一寸土地，触动我们一根毫毛。
    现在，艾森豪威尔又勾结岸信介订立日美军事同盟条约，复活日本军国主义，把侵略矛头指向中国、苏联和亚洲各国爱好和平的人民，把日本人民重新拖入灾难的深渊。这就再一次用铁的事实证明了美帝国主义是中国人民的死敌，是日本人民的死敌，是一切要求民族独立的人民的死敌，也是亚洲和全世界一切爱好和平的人民的死敌。为了争取民族独立，为了争取真正的、持久的和平，就只有打倒美帝国主义。出路只有这一条，办法只有这一个。现在，各被压迫民族已经愈来愈认清楚了美帝国主义的真面目，帝国主义脚下的火山一个接着一个地爆发了。南朝鲜人民、土耳其人民燃起了反帝爱国斗争的烈火，日本人民又掀起了一个波澜壮阔、势不可当的斗争浪潮。帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎，警棒、催泪弹、枪弹、炮弹、坦克以及各种欺骗手腕，都挽救不了它灭亡的命运，帝国主义一定会被人民革命的铁拳砸得粉身碎骨。李承晚的下场就是岸信介和一切反动派的下场。人民是历史的主人，最后的胜利一定属于日本和全世界的人民！
    反对日美军事同盟条约！
    反对复活日本军国主义！
    美帝国主义从日本滚出去！
    从南朝鲜滚出去！从南越滚出去！从土耳其滚出去！从菲律宾滚出去！从我国领土台湾滚出去！
    打倒美帝国主义！
