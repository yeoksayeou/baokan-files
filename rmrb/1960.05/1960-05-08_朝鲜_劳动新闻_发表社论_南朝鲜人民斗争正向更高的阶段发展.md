Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 7th - The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published an editorial today stating that the South Korean people's struggle is developing towards a new and higher stage. After overthrowing the Syngman Rhee puppet government, the people's struggle has developed into a struggle demanding the complete abolition of the fascist ruling apparatus. The editorial emphasized that the American aggressor troops must immediately withdraw from South Korea, and the end of American imperialism's colonial rule in South Korea is inevitable.

The editorial stated that the South Korean people's heroic struggle for freedom, democracy, and the right to survive has continued for nearly two months. The prestige of the United States has once again been swept away. The Korean people defeated American imperialism for the first time in history during the Korean War. This time, the South Korean people's struggle has shaken the colonial rule of American imperialism.

The editorial said that the South Korean people's struggle is now developing towards a new and higher stage, as evidenced by the recent demonstrations in Busan and other places under slogans such as "Corrupt National Assembly, step down!", "The Liberal Party and the Democratic Party are no good!", and "Politicians, get out!". In addition, in Busan and Incheon, workers have also launched new struggles demanding democratic rights. Thus, the South Korean people's struggle cannot but develop into a struggle to eradicate the roots of political enslavement, hunger, and poverty.

The editorial stated that in order to save its colonial policy which is in crisis, American imperialism is reorganizing its forces in South Korea and suppressing the people. In order to maintain Syngman Rhee's fascist terror regime, they have brought out the likes of Heo Jeong, who is called "Syngman Rhee the Second."

The editorial pointed out that Heo Jeong and his ilk, under the manipulation of American imperialism, have put up the signboard of a so-called "caretaker cabinet," and they deceptively clamor about "renovating the national administration" and "political reform," as if everything can be solved by implementing a "responsible cabinet system," "revising the constitution," and "re-elections." The editorial emphasized that as long as the fascist ruling apparatus remains intact, and as long as American imperialism continues to occupy South Korea, even if a "responsible cabinet system" is implemented, it will not change the essence of the puppet regime in the slightest.

The editorial said: American imperialism says that it wants to conduct "elections" under "United Nations supervision," which clearly shows what they are clamoring for in "re-elections." The infamous fraudulent "elections" held on March 15 this year were conducted under so-called "United Nations supervision." Now, the people of the world have recognized that the so-called "elections" under "United Nations supervision" are nothing more than a farce directed by American imperialism in order to carry out colonial rule in South Korea and create a puppet fascist regime.

The editorial said that Heo Jeong and his ilk have promoted the police "chiefs" and "section chiefs" who directly commanded or directly suppressed and massacred the South Korean people to the positions of police "bureau chiefs" in various provinces, or transferred them elsewhere. This is the essence of what Heo Jeong and his ilk call "national administration renovation" and "reform."

The editorial said that the fact that Heo Jeong and his ilk have revived Syngman Rhee's broken old "anti-communist" trumpet further confirms that the so-called "caretaker cabinet" is a replica of the Syngman Rhee fascist regime.

The editorial said that no deception or suppression by American imperialism and its lackeys can stop the struggle of the South Korean people. The South Korean people have already grasped the key to settling accounts with the dark colonial rule of American imperialism and realizing the transformation of a new politics, a new system, and a new life. The South Korean people will continue to ignite the flames of struggle until their demands are met.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 7th - Seoul News: The flames of South Korean workers' strike struggles are burning across South Korea.

According to the South Korean "Dong-A Ilbo," more than 400 female workers at the Dongbang Silk Reeling Factory in Chuncheon, Gangwon Province, near the armistice line, went on strike, demanding that their wages be doubled. Their wages are less than one-third of the minimum cost of living.

According to reports, more than 300 workers at the Seoul Railway Bureau have launched a struggle against mass layoffs. They submitted a letter of protest to the pseudo-"Ministry of Transportation," demanding that the decision to lay them off be rescinded immediately. The Railway Bureau laid them off at the beginning of last month on the pretext of lack of funds.

According to the "Busan Ilbo," 73 children in an orphanage in Gyeongsangnam-do recently escaped in protest against the vicious "director." The report said that the "director" had embezzled some of the orphans' rations. In early November last year, the children in this orphanage went on a hunger strike to protest against the abuse of them by the "director."

### 朝鲜“劳动新闻”发表社论  南朝鲜人民斗争正向更高的阶段发展

    朝鲜“劳动新闻”发表社论
    南朝鲜人民斗争正向更高的阶段发展
    美帝国主义在南朝鲜的殖民统治的结束是不可避免的
    新华社平壤7日电　朝鲜“劳动新闻”今天发表社论说，南朝鲜人民的斗争正向着新的更高的阶段发展。在打倒了李承晚傀儡政府以后，人民的斗争发展成为要求完全废除法西斯统治机构的斗争。社论强调说，美国侵略军必须立即从南朝鲜撤走，美帝国主义在南朝鲜的殖民统治的结束是不可避免的。
    社论说，南朝鲜人民为争取自由民主和生存权利而进行的英勇斗争已持续近两个月了。美国的威信又一次扫地了。朝鲜人民在朝鲜战争中使美帝国主义在历史上第一次吃了败仗。这次南朝鲜人民的斗争又动摇了美帝国主义的殖民统治。
    社论说，南朝鲜人民的斗争现在正向新的更高的阶段发展着，就如同最近釜山等地人民在“腐败的国会滚下台来”、“自由党、民主党都不是好东西”、“政客们滚开”等口号下进行的示威斗争所证明的一样。另外，在釜山和仁川，工人们还展开了要求民主权利的新的斗争。这样，南朝鲜人民的斗争不能不发展成为拔除政治上的奴役以及饥饿、贫穷的根源的斗争。
    社论说，美帝国主义为了挽救它的陷入危机的殖民政策，正在南朝鲜整顿力量，并且对人民进行镇压。为了维持李承晚法西斯恐怖统治机构，它们搬出了被叫做“李承晚第二”的许政之流。
    社论指出，许政之流在美帝国主义的操纵下挂起所谓“看守内阁”的牌子，他们欺骗性地叫嚷什么“刷新国政”，“政治改革”，好像只要实行什么“责任内阁制”、“修改宪法”、“重新选举”就能解决一切问题。社论强调指出，只要法西斯统治机构原封未动，只要美帝国主义还强占着南朝鲜，即便实行“责任内阁制”也不会使傀儡政权的本质有丝毫的改变。
    社论说：美帝国主义说什么要在“联合国监督”下进行“选举”，这就清清楚楚地说明他们所叫嚷的“重新选举”将是什么东西。今年3月15日进行的臭名远扬的骗人“选举”就是在所谓“联合国监督”下进行的。现在全世界人民都认清了所谓在“联合国监督”下的“选举”，只不过是美帝国主义为了在南朝鲜进行殖民统治、制造傀儡法西斯政权而导演的一出丑剧。
    社论说，许政之流把直接指挥或直接镇压和屠杀南朝鲜人民的警察“署长”和“科长”提升为各道的警察“局长”，或调到别处去了，这就是许政之流叫嚷的什么“国政刷新”、什么“改革”的本质。
    社论说，许政之流重新吹起李承晚的破旧的“反共”喇叭这一事实更加证实了所谓“看守内阁”，就是李承晚法西斯政权的翻版。
    社论说，美帝国主义及其走狗任何欺骗和镇压也阻止不了南朝鲜人民的斗争。南朝鲜人民已经自己掌握了清算美帝国主义的黑暗的殖民统治以及实现新政治、新制度、新生活的变革的钥匙，南朝鲜人民将继续燃起斗争的火焰，直到达到他们的要求为止。
    据新华社平壤7日电　汉城消息：南朝鲜工人罢工斗争的烽火正在南朝鲜各地燃烧。
    据南朝鲜“东亚日报”报道，靠近停战线的江原道春川东邦缫丝厂的四百多名女工举行罢工，要求把工资提高一倍。她们的工资还不到最低生活费用的三分之一。
    据报道，汉城铁路局的三百多名工人展开了反对集体解雇的斗争。他们向伪“交通部”提交了一份抗议书，要求立即取消解雇他们的决定。铁路局在上月初借口缺乏资金把他们解雇了。
    另据“釜山日报”报道，庆尚南道孤儿院里的七十三名儿童为反对恶毒的“院长”，最近全部逃走了。报道说，这个“院长”曾经私吞了某些孤儿的口粮。去年11月初，这个孤儿院的儿童就曾经举行过绝食，反对虐待他们的“院长”。
