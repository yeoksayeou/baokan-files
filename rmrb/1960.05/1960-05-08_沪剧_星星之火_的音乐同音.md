　　The Music of the Shanghai Opera "A Single Spark"

　　Barren fields, scattered in all directions,
　　Seeing the girls off to the yarn factory,
　　Girls entering the factory are like flowers,
　　Girls leaving the factory are like ghosts.

　　Anyone who has seen the Shanghai Opera "A Single Spark" cannot help but be moved by the following scene: Yang Guiei, a hardworking rural woman, has no choice but to bring her son to Shanghai after enduring untold hardships in search of her daughter, Xiao Zhenzi, who is, as the lyrics above describe, a "bonded laborer" who has pledged her body to a contractor. Yang Guiei finally finds Xiao Zhenzi's residence, but the wicked contractor prevents them from seeing each other. When Xiao Zhenzi returns from the factory after work, Yang Guiei is dragged away by the contractor as soon as she sees her daughter, who has been tortured to the point of being skin and bones, forcibly separating the mother and daughter by a wall. Inside and outside the wall, they pour out their hearts to each other, and the moving duets and ensembles tightly grip the hearts of the audience.

　　Those familiar with Shanghai Opera cannot help but worry: can the Shanghai Opera's singing style, known for its beautiful and gentle Jiangnan style, be competent to express such a major revolutionary historical subject matter? Yes, this is precisely a challenge facing Shanghai Opera music. How can traditional Shanghai Opera tunes portray the image of female worker Yang Guiei, and how can it shape the image of underground Party worker Liu Ying? This is not without its difficulties. However, after watching the entire play, we feel that the actors sang very well and it sounded very comfortable. Or, it could be said that the reason we were able to be moved and excited while watching the play was, in large part, due to the feelings given to us by the singing, in addition to the moving plot and the delicate stage performance.

　　Let's look at a few key points in the development process of Yang Guiei's character: when this country woman first comes to Shanghai to find her daughter and is bullied by the contractor Zhuang Laosi, the singing used to portray the character's emotions is basically still mournful and lingering. But when Xiao Zhenzi is murdered, Yang Guiei goes out at midnight, holding scissors to find the thief to avenge her, the fast-paced and slow singing is very different in style from before. At this time, Yang Guiei is not yet a conscious worker, but we can feel from the singing that the fire of struggle has begun to burn within her. Thanks to Liu Ying's enlightenment and education, she relies on the trade union and throws herself into the struggle of the entire class. She gradually grows up, firmly insists on the strike struggle, and sharply exposes the rumors and sabotage of the labor traitors. But this is not yet the severe test. She is kidnapped by the running dogs of the Japanese capitalists, the gangster foremen, who threaten her with daggers and try to buy her off with money, trying to use her to slander the Communist Party and exonerate the Japanese murderers. In this dangerous struggle, she not only demonstrates her firm class stand, but also demonstrates her wit in this struggle where the forces are so disparate. She uses the Japanese's check to publicly expose the truth about Xiao Zhenzi's tragic death and the enemy's conspiracy at a press conference. The long passage of narrative singing she sings is truly exciting, one sentence after another, like the raging waves of the Huangpu River. This fascinating singing makes the character of Yang Guiei even more vivid.

　　Shanghai Opera is one of the earliest opera forms to attempt to depict modern life. From "The White-Haired Girl" and "Copper Coins" in the early days of liberation to the current "A Single Spark", this series of practices has not only accumulated many positive experiences, but also promoted the development of Shanghai Opera music itself. For example, the use of foreign forms such as the ensemble, which we mentioned earlier, has had relatively successful experiences in Shanghai Opera. This application not only needs to solve the contradiction between foreign forms and tradition, but more importantly, it must be applied appropriately, so that this form of expression can best exert its emotional and artistic effects in the drama. The reason why the ensemble in "A Single Spark" is so moving is also because it is used appropriately. This form of expression undoubtedly enriches the expressiveness of Shanghai Opera music and will gradually form a new traditional form. Furthermore, the singing used to portray the character of Liu Ying in the play is much more difficult to handle than the singing of Yang Guiei. On the one hand, it is because this is the image of a Party leader, and on the other hand, traditional Shanghai Opera lacks majestic and passionate tunes. Therefore, it can be seen from the several main tunes sung by Liu Ying (such as the passage "The moonlight is dark, the stars are dim, full of resentment" when she hears the news of Comrade Gu Zhenghong's sacrifice, and the passage in the final mass demonstration scene) that there is a conscious absorption of certain factors of the tunes of other opera forms and revolutionary music to strengthen the expression of passion and grandeur, in order to make up for the shortcomings of traditional Shanghai Opera music. Of course, the creation of this part of the tune is not mature enough. The absorption and combination are also inevitably stiff, but this intention must be affirmed, and after continuous polishing, they will definitely be more perfect.

　　Generally speaking, the music of the Shanghai Opera "A Single Spark" moved the audience. Of course, it also has its shortcomings. Some viewers felt that the keynote of the first act was too low and bleak. The combination of the dim picture on the stage and the desolate and mournful music makes this feeling even more prominent, making people feel depressed. Naturally, this dim and oppressive atmosphere has a certain degree of realistic significance in that dark and miserable era. However, as an artistic embodiment, we should also see and reflect the truth of a higher meaning. What is this higher truth? That is, the leadership of the Party has already appeared, and the masses of workers are no longer helpless exploited people, but have a strong trade union as their backing. Precisely because of this point, the performance of music should not be limited to the truth of a certain aspect, but should focus on a higher perspective, and make a more prominent expression of this new factor (a factor with decisive significance) in real life, and evoke a more distinct feeling in the hearts of the audience.

　　In addition, the entire orchestra music part, this performance particularly focused on following the tradition of opera, and did not render it much, appearing very simple, and also tried to use percussion instruments that Shanghai Opera is not good at, which are all good. But it is also unsatisfying, especially in places where music is needed to set off the atmosphere, the music seems very thin. For example, Xiao Zhenzi's tragic death, Yang Guiei's revenge with scissors in the dark night, the news of Comrade Gu Zhenghong's sacrifice, and the parade and demonstration, etc., the existing music has failed to achieve the role of setting off the mood and rendering the atmosphere. On the entire opera stage, the orchestra is of course an auxiliary means of expression, but the dramatic expressiveness of this means cannot be replaced by other means, especially when the dramatic mood develops to a certain degree and music must be used to render the atmosphere, the role of the orchestra is particularly prominent. In this regard, the development of Shanghai Opera music in the past ten years has had many positive experiences that can be inherited and applied. In the development of orchestra music, we oppose the tendency to be big and foreign, and insist on inheriting the national tradition, but this does not mean rejecting the positive achievements of the past and beneficial experiences from abroad. In this play "A Single Spark", if this point can be resolved well, it will further strengthen the brilliance of its theme.

    沪剧“星星之火”的音乐
    同音
    田园荒、奔四方，
    相送姑娘进纱厂，
    姑娘进厂像朵花，
    姑娘出厂像鬼样。
    凡是看过沪剧《星星之火》的人，都不免要为这样的场面所感动：杨桂英，一个勤劳的农村妇女，她因为在家乡活不下去，不得不带着儿子历尽千辛万苦，跑到上海来寻找她的女儿小珍子，小珍子，正像上面这首歌词所描述的那样，是一个将人身抵押给包工头的一个
  “包身工”。杨桂英好不容易才找到小珍子的住处，然而，万恶的包工头却不让她们母女相见。当小珍子从工厂放工回来，杨桂英刚一见到被折磨得骨瘦如柴的女儿，就立即被包工头拖开，强使母女俩相隔一堵墙。墙里墙外，各自倾诉衷肠，那一段段动人的对唱和重唱，紧紧扣住了观众的心弦。
    熟悉沪剧的人都不免担心：以优美委婉的江南风格见长的沪剧唱腔，对表现这样重大的革命历史题材怎么能够胜任？是的，这正是摆在沪剧音乐面前的一个难题。传统的沪剧曲调如何刻划女工杨桂英的形象，如何塑造党的地下工作者刘英的形象，这并不是没有困难的。然而，看完整个戏之后，我们觉得演员都唱得很好，听起来很舒服。或者可以这样说：我们在看戏的时候之所以能受感染、被激动，除了由于动人的故事情节和细腻的舞台表演之外，有相当大的成份是因为唱腔所给予我们的感受。
    我们且看杨桂英这个人物性格成长过程的几个关键吧：当这个乡下女人初来上海寻找女儿，受到包工头庄老四的欺凌，这时用以刻划人物感情的唱腔基本上还是哀怨、缠绵的。但当小珍子被残杀，杨桂英夜半出门，手持剪刀寻贼报仇，那段悲愤的快板慢唱，在格调上就和前面大不相同了，这时的杨桂英虽还算不上一个有觉悟的工人，但我们从唱腔里体会到，斗争的怒火已在她身上燃烧起来了。由于刘英的启发教育，她依靠了工会，投入了整个阶级的斗争，她逐渐成长起来了，她坚定地坚持罢工斗争，尖锐地揭穿工贼的造谣破坏。但这还不是严酷的考验。她被日本资本家的走狗流氓工头绑架，用匕首威吓她，用金钱收买她，想利用她来诬蔑共产党，为日本凶手开脱。在这场凶险的斗争中，她一方面表现了坚定不移的阶级立场，一方面又在这众寡悬殊的斗争中表现了她的机智，她利用了日本人的支票在记者招待会上公开揭露小珍子惨死事件的真相和敌人的阴谋。她唱的那大段赋子板，真是激动人心，一句紧接一句，恰似黄浦怒涛。这一段引人入胜的唱腔，使杨桂英这一人物形象更为鲜明了。
    沪剧是最早尝试表现现代生活的剧种之一。从解放初期的《白毛女》、《罗汉钱》到现在的《星星之火》，这一系列的实践，一方面积累了很多积极的经验，一方面也推动了沪剧音乐本身的发展。例如说，我们在前面提到的重唱这种外来形式，在沪剧里的运用就有着比较成功的经验，这种运用，不但要解决外来形式与传统之间的矛盾，更重要的是要运用得恰当，要使这种表现形式在戏剧中能最好地发挥它情感上、艺术上的效果。《星星之火》这一场的重唱之所以能那样动人，也由于它运用得恰到好处。这种表现形式无疑地丰富了沪剧音乐的表现力，并将逐渐形成为一种新的传统形式。再如，剧中刻划刘英这一人物形象的唱腔，处理起来要比杨桂英的唱腔困难得多。一方面是由于这是党的领导者的形象，一方面是传统的沪剧缺少雄伟激昂的调子。因此，从刘英所唱的几个主要曲调（如：听到顾正红同志牺牲的消息时所唱的“月色暗，星斗浑，满腔愤恨”那一段，和最后群众示威游行场面的一段）里，可以看出是在有意识地吸收其它剧种的音调和革命音乐的音调的某些因素，来加强激昂、雄壮这一方面的表现，以弥补传统沪剧音乐的不足。当然，这部分曲调创作得还不够成熟。吸收、结合也还难免有生硬的感觉，但这种意图却是必须肯定的，并且，经过不断地琢磨加工，它们一定会更完美的。
    总的说来，沪剧《星星之火》的音乐是感动了观众的。当然它也有不足的地方。有的观众感到第一场的基调太低沉、凄凉。舞台上昏暗的画面，和那凄凉哀怨的音乐相结合，这种感觉就更为突出，使人在心情上感到压抑。自然，这种昏暗、压抑的气氛在当时那黑暗而苦难的时代说来，是具有某一方面的真实意义的。但是，作为一种艺术体现，还应该看到并且反映出更高意义的真实。这更高的真实是什么？那就是已经出现了党的领导，工人群众已不再是无依无靠的被剥削者，他们有坚强的工会作后盾。正是由于这一点，音乐的表现就不能拘泥于某一方面的真实，而应该从更高的角度上着眼，把现实生活中这一新的因素（具有决定意义的因素）作更突出的表现，在观众的心灵上唤起更鲜明的感受。
    此外，整个乐队音乐部分，这次演出特别着力于遵循戏曲的传统，并不大事渲染，显得很朴素，并且也尝试着运用沪剧并不擅长的打击乐，这都是好的。但它同时也令人不满足，特别是在需要音乐烘托气氛的地方，音乐就显得很单薄。例如小珍子惨死，杨桂英黑夜持剪刀去报仇、传来顾正红同志牺牲的消息，以及游行示威等等的场面，现有的音乐都未能达到其烘托情绪、渲染气氛的作用。在整个戏曲舞台上，乐队当然是一种辅助的表现手段，但是，这种手段的戏剧性的表现力，却是它种手段所不能代替的，特别是当戏剧情绪发展到一定的程度必须音乐来渲染气氛时，乐队的这种作用就特别突出。在这方面，沪剧音乐十年来的发展原是有许多积极的经验可以继承运用的。在乐队音乐的发展上，我们反对要大要洋的倾向，而坚持继承民族传统，但这决不意味着拒绝以往的积极成果和外来的有益经验。在《星星之火》这出戏里，如果这一点能解决得好，将更会加强其主题思想的光辉。
