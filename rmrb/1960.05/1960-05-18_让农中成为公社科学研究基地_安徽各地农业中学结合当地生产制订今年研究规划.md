    Turn Agricultural Middle Schools into Scientific Research Bases for Communes
    Agricultural Middle Schools in Various Parts of Anhui Province Develop This Year's Research Plans in Combination with Local Production
    (Our newspaper's dispatch) The Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is focusing on the scientific research work of agricultural middle schools, with the goal of cultivating all agricultural middle schools in the province into bases for agricultural scientific research for the people's communes.
    Currently, 812 agricultural middle schools across the province are carrying out extensive scientific research activities in conjunction with local current production. According to the needs of spring production, the Chumao Commune Agricultural Middle School in Lai'an County carried out scientific research on rice, wheat, corn, soil, and fertilizer in advance, and has achieved preliminary results. In response to the occurrence of white leaf blight in rice last year, the school used a microscope to check the rice seeds and found spotted germs on them. They adopted salt water disinfection and found a way to kill the germs attached to the seeds. In the soil test, it was found that more than 160 mu of paddy fields planted by the school were weakly acidic soil, which was not conducive to rice growth. After experiments, it was successful to improve the soil by using 15 jin of lime, 4 dan of cattle manure and 30 dan of green manure per mu, and the weakly acidic soil has become neutral soil. The Puji Commune Agricultural Middle School in He County planted "Liushizi" rice on dog liver soil that local farmers were unwilling to plant last year by taking measures such as applying rice seedlings with warm cattle manure and increasing pond mud. The yield per mu reached 1,250 jin, which was 50% higher than the local rice yield per mu; at the same time, the yellow mud soil was improved and cotton was planted, with a yield of 300 jin of ginned cotton per mu. The Huangkou Commune Agricultural Middle School in Xiao County researched and manufactured bacterial fertilizers such as nitrogen-fixing bacteria and phosphorus bacteria. More than 60 teachers and students mastered the complete set of manufacturing technology and established a comprehensive local chemical fertilizer factory with a daily output of 30,000 jin of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, grass ash potassium sulfate, phosphamide, and local potassium, which guaranteed the fertilizer supply for 150,000 mu of crops.
    The achievements of agricultural middle schools in various parts of Anhui show that agricultural middle schools can not only undertake the task of serving agricultural production and preparing primary cadres for improving rural culture and technology, but are also suitable as agricultural scientific research bases for communes to promote mass technological innovation movements.
    Agricultural middle schools in various parts of Anhui have formulated plans for scientific research to be carried out this year in light of local agricultural production conditions, and focus on the following key points for research: First, research on comprehensive measures to increase the production of grain, cotton, and oil crops, according to the spirit of the three reforms of agricultural production proposed by the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, so that grain, cotton, and oil production can be increased quickly, greatly, with less money and less effort. Second, focus on research on the measures for rapid growth and high yield of pigs and on excellent breeds and epidemic prevention. Third, conduct research on the comprehensive utilization of agricultural and sideline products and wild plants to achieve multiple uses for one thing and make the best use of everything. Fourth, carry out research on biogas. Fifth, take the "Eight-Character Charter for Agriculture" as the guideline and focus on single-item research and experiments focusing on seeds, fertilizers, soil, and protection. In addition, tool reforms and meteorological research will also be carried out.
    Party committees at all levels in Anhui attach great importance to the work of cultivating agricultural middle schools as scientific research bases for communes, and actively support them in terms of manpower and material resources. The principals of agricultural middle schools are personally concurrently served by the heads of the commune party committees. The commune allocated land for experiments, equipped teachers, and added necessary equipment.

    让农中成为公社科学研究基地
    安徽各地农业中学结合当地生产制订今年研究规划
    本报讯　中共安徽省委大抓农业中学的科学研究工作，要把全省的农业中学，培养成为人民公社农业科学研究的基地。
    目前全省八百一十二所农业中学结合当地当前生产，开展了广泛的科学研究活动。来安县储茂公社农业中学根据春季生产的需要，提前进行了水稻、小麦、玉米、土壤、肥料等的科学研究，并且已取得了初步成果。该校根据当地去年水稻发生白叶死的情况，用显微镜对稻种进行了检查，发现稻种上有斑点病菌，采用盐水消毒，找到了杀死附在种子上的病菌的办法。在土壤化验中，发现学校种的水田有一百六十多亩是弱酸性土壤，不利于水稻的生长，经过试验，每亩用十五斤石灰、四担牛粪和三十担绿肥来改良土壤，已获得成功，弱酸性土壤已变成中性土壤。和县濮集公社农业中学，在去年当地农民不愿种的狗肝土上，采取下秧草施暖性牛粪及增施塘泥等办法，种上“六十子”水稻，亩产达一千二百五十斤，比当地水稻亩产提高50％；同时改良了黄泥土，种上棉花，亩产皮棉三百斤。肖县黄口公社农业中学研究制成了固氮菌、磷细菌等细菌肥料，六十多名师生掌握了全套制造技术，并且建立了日产三万斤的氮磷钾、草木灰硫酸钾、磷胺、土制钾等综合性的土化肥厂，保证了十五万亩农作物的肥料供应。
    安徽各地农业中学所取得的成就，说明农业中学不但可以承担起为农业生产服务，为提高农村文化和技术准备初级干部的任务，而且作为公社科学研究基地，推动群众性的技术革新运动，也是合适的。
    安徽各地农业中学都结合当地农业生产情况，制订出了今年要着手进行科学研究的规划，并且抓住以下几个重点进行研究：一、粮、棉、油料作物的增产综合性措施的研究，根据中共安徽省委提出的农业生产三项改革精神，使粮、棉、油增产快、增产大、花钱少、花力少。二、抓紧猪的速生多产措施和优良品种、防疫的研究。三、进行对农副产品和野生植物的综合利用的研究，做到一物多用，物尽其用。四、进行沼气的研究工作。五、以“农业八字宪法”为纲，以种、肥、土、保为重点进行单项研究试验。此外还要进行工具改革和气象的研究。
    安徽各地党委对培养农业中学为公社科学研究的基地这一工作，十分重视，积极从人力、物力上进行支持。农业中学的校长都是公社党委负责人亲自兼任的，公社划给试验的土地，配备师资，增添必要的设备。
