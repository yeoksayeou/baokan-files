Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, May 21st: The Albanian government issued a statement on the 20th, fully supporting the Soviet government's position on the Four-Power Summit and condemning American imperialism for undermining the summit.

The statement said that the Albanian government fully supports the statement made by Chairman Khrushchev of the Soviet Council of Ministers at the preparatory meeting of the summit and the actions taken. The Soviet government's position on this issue has powerfully defended the supreme interests of the Soviet Union and peace, as well as the fundamental principles on which sovereign states and international relations are based, while exposing the true face of American imperialist aggressive policies, making a valuable contribution to the defense of peace.

The statement pointed out that the American imperialist leadership group has recently tried its best to escalate international tensions and the "Cold War" and undermine the summit. Recently, it even sent spy planes to violate Soviet airspace and claimed this as an established American national policy. In this way, American imperialism has completely and consciously undermined the summit with these predetermined acts of aggression, thereby bearing a very serious responsibility. At the same time, this also exposes the true face of American imperialism.

The statement said that Khrushchev's statement at the preparatory meeting of the Paris Four-Power Summit was a powerful warning to the aggressors and an extraordinarily great help to all countries defending independence, territorial integrity, and national sovereignty.

The statement concluded that the Albanian government is determined to fight together with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries to ease international tensions. At the same time, it will redouble its vigilance against the conspiracies of imperialism and its lackeys.

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, May 21st: According to the Bulgarian News Agency, the government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria issued a statement today regarding the failure of the Four-Power Summit, stating that the responsibility rests entirely with the United States.

The statement pointed out that while the Soviet Union was making every effort to ease international tensions and create a favorable environment for the summit, the United States was continuing to pursue a policy that had nothing in common with creating conditions for effective negotiations. American leaders declared with unprecedented shamelessness that these provocative acts are American national policy and that they will continue to implement this policy in the future. With this unprecedented behavior, the American rulers have shown that they do not respect any norms of international relations, nor the sovereignty of other countries; they have shown that the foundation of American foreign policy remains bandit-like flights, espionage, provocations, and aggression.

The statement continued, it is clear that under these conditions the Soviet Union could not sit at the same table with the American government to negotiate.

The statement concluded by emphasizing that the Bulgarian government and the people of the whole country unconditionally support the statement of the Soviet government, and warmly welcome the firm position taken by the Soviet delegation and the head of the Soviet government, Khrushchev.

    阿尔巴尼亚和保加利亚政府发表声明
    支持苏联严正立场反对美国挑衅
    谴责美国领导集团加剧国际紧张局势破坏四国会议
    新华社地拉那21日电　阿尔巴尼亚政府20日发表声明，完全支持苏联政府对四国政府首脑会议采取的立场，并谴责美帝国主义破坏首脑会议。
    声明说，阿尔巴尼亚政府完全支持苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在首脑会议预备会议上发表的声明和所采取的行动。苏联政府在这一问题上所持的立场有力地保卫了苏联和和平的最高利益，以及各主权国家和国际关系中所依据的基本原则，同时揭露了美帝国主义侵略政策的真面目，对保卫和平作出了有价值贡献。
    声明指出，美帝国主义领导集团最近时期竭力企图加剧国际紧张局势和“冷战”并破坏首脑会议。最近，它甚至派遣间谍飞机侵犯苏联领空，并声称这是美国的既定国策。这样，美帝国主义就以它的这些预定的侵略行动完全有意识地破坏了首脑会议，从而为此承担了非常严重的责任。同时，这也暴露了美帝国主义的真面目。
    声明说，赫鲁晓夫在巴黎四国首脑会议预备会上的声明对侵略者是一个强有力的警告，同时，对所有保卫独立、领土完整和民族主权的国家是一个异常巨大的帮助。
    声明最后说，阿尔巴尼亚政府决心和苏联以及其他社会主义国家一起为争取缓和国际紧张局势而斗争。同时，它将几倍地提高对帝国主义和它的走狗的阴谋的警惕性。
    新华社索非亚21日电　据保加利亚通讯社报道，保加利亚人民共和国政府今天就四国首脑会议没有能够举行发表声明说，这一责任完全应该由美国来承担。
    声明指出，当苏联尽一切努力来缓和国际紧张局势，并为首脑会议创造良好环境的时候，美国却在继续执行同有效的谈判创造条件毫无共同之处的政策。美国领导人以空前的无耻态度声明这些挑衅行为就是美国的国家政策，并且他们今后还将继续执行这种政策。美国统治者以这种前所未有的行为表明，他们不尊重任何国际关系的准则，不尊重其它国家的主权；表明美国对外政策的基础仍然是强盗式的飞行、间谍活动、挑衅和侵略。
    声明接着说，很明显，在这种条件下苏联不能同美国政府坐在一张桌子旁边谈判。
    声明最后强调说，保加利亚政府和全国人民无条件地支持苏联政府的声明，对苏联代表团和苏联政府首脑赫鲁晓夫所采取的坚定立场表示热烈的欢迎。
