Hold High the Banner of Mao Zedong Thought and Continue to Leap Forward
Lin Liming, Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and First Secretary of the Hainan Regional Committee

May 1st is International Labor Day, and also the tenth anniversary of the liberation of Hainan Island, Guangdong Province. "Spirits are high when celebrating a happy occasion." On such a doubly festive day, the people of Hainan are filled with indescribable excitement, singing praises of the great festival and the great victories of the past decade. At the same time, they are filled with firm confidence, holding high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and continuing to advance along the path of the socialist construction's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes.

Since 1927, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the people of Hainan have persisted in a long-term, arduous, and successive struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in order to achieve their own liberation. They established worker-peasant democratic governments, organized people's revolutionary armed forces, and built revolutionary base areas, persisting in the struggle on the isolated island for more than twenty years. On the eve of the May Day holiday in 1950, the heroic People's Liberation Army, after unifying the mainland of the country, conquered the turbulent Qiongzhou Strait with overwhelming momentum, eliminating the Kuomintang reactionary bandit gangs entrenched on the island. Since then, Hainan has entered a new historical period.

In the past ten years, like all other parts of the country, Hainan has undergone tremendous and profound changes. Under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and under the correct leadership of the Guangdong Provincial Committee, the island's three million people of all ethnic groups and the People's Liberation Army officers and soldiers guarding Hainan Island have quickly swept away the mire and filth left by the reactionary government, healed the wounds of war, carried out socialist transformation and socialist construction, and achieved decisive victories in the socialist revolution on the political, economic, and ideological fronts. In particular, after the continuous Great Leap Forward of 1958-1959, all aspects of work have developed rapidly. Hainan Island has fundamentally changed its appearance in just ten short years.

The transformation of the ownership of the means of production, the elimination of feudalism and capitalism's exploitative production relations, and the establishment of socialist production relations are the most fundamental changes of the past decade. Like all other parts of the country, we carried out land reform, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and various democratic reform movements, followed by the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce. Before the land reform, landlords, who accounted for only 3.6% of the island's population, owned more than 30% of the island's cultivated land; they also possessed a large number of draught animals and agricultural implements, cruelly exploiting the labor of the peasants. After the land reform, the island's 1.6 million landless and land-poor peasants, farm laborers, and lower-middle peasants were allocated an average of 1.7 mu of land per person, as well as a large number of draught animals, agricultural implements, and other means of production. Subsequently, the scattered individual agricultural and handicraft economies were transformed into socialist collective economies, enabling peasants and small producers to forever escape poverty and exploitation; private industrial and commercial enterprises were transformed into socialist enterprises. In this way, diverse economies were transformed into a single socialist economy, achieving a decisive victory in the socialist revolution on the economic front. In 1958, inspired by the General Line and the Great Leap Forward, the scale of production continued to expand, and the original agricultural producers' cooperatives could no longer adapt to the needs of the situation. People's communes were rapidly established in the countryside. The island's 2,380 advanced cooperatives were merged to establish 142 people's communes.

The change of the old production relations and the establishment of new socialist production relations have liberated the productive forces and promoted the rapid development of the productive forces. During this period, the Party and the government took various measures to restore and develop the productive forces, and invested large amounts of capital and equipment in basic construction. From 1952 to 1959, the state's investment in basic construction in Hainan reached 700 million yuan, and the investment in state-owned farms reached 280 million yuan. Before liberation, due to feudal rule and exploitation, natural disasters and man-made calamities, agricultural productive forces were greatly damaged, and ethnic minority areas, which accounted for half of the island's area, were still in the primitive farming stage of "slash-and-burn" cultivation, treading the fields with cattle, and twisting rice by hand. With the completion of land reform, the development of mutual aid and cooperation movements and the communization movement, coupled with state support, agricultural productive forces have been greatly developed. In addition to actively restoring and developing draught animals, the Party and the government have vigorously promoted new agricultural implements, carried out tool reforms, promoted new cultivation techniques, and implemented the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture. Over the past decade, 320,000 new-style plows, 30,000 double-shared plows, 1 million ox carts and handcarts, and a large number of cultivators, threshers, seeders, and other agricultural machines have been promoted. At present, state-owned farms and tractor stations have a total of 1,100 standard tractors and 7,600 horsepower of mechanized irrigation and drainage equipment. This is the foundation for achieving agricultural mechanization.

Before liberation, there was almost no foundation for water conservancy projects on the island, and soil erosion was extremely serious. Although there was a lot of rainfall, it was often threatened by severe drought. Over the past decade, especially since the Great Leap Forward, the people of the island, with the heroic spirit of "making high mountains bow their heads and rivers give way," have carried out water conservancy construction work, completing more than 120,000 large and small water conservancy projects, irrigating an area of 2.18 million mu. In particular, under the leadership and support of the Central Committee and the Provincial Committee, one of Hainan's three major water conservancy projects – the Songtao Reservoir – has begun construction, and the other two major reservoirs – Jiaxingling and Jiaza – will also be built successively. In the near future, the island's water conservancy and power grids will be established due to the completion of the three major reservoirs.

Hainan is a rare tropical region in China and should vigorously develop various tropical cash crops to meet the needs of the country's socialist construction. Over the past decade, with the strong support of the Central Committee and the Provincial Committee, agricultural reclamation has made great progress, and state-owned farms are dotted everywhere. In recent years, millions of mu of wasteland have been reclaimed. At present, the planting area of tropical crops on the island has expanded about twenty times compared with before liberation. Among them, oil palm, known as the "world's oil king," has increased by 10,000 times compared with before liberation, coffee has increased by 100 times, and spice crops have increased by 300 times.

Before liberation, there was almost no modern industry in Hainan. Now, there are not only light industry, food industry, and tropical crop processing industry, but also industries such as iron and steel, machinery manufacturing, cement, coal mining, timber, and oil refining. As a result of vigorously carrying out technological revolution and technological innovation, production capacity has been continuously improved and a large number of new products have been trial-produced. A total of 147 new modern factories have been built. The iron and steel joint enterprise centered on the Shilu Iron Mine is being gradually constructed, and the cement plant with an annual output of 60,000 tons has been put into production. As for commune industries, they are blooming everywhere.

In terms of transportation, more than 6,000 kilometers of highways have been repaired and newly built on the island, with an average of one kilometer of highway per five square kilometers, equivalent to seven times that before liberation. At present, the island's ring road and the north-south and east-west highways have been opened, forming a highway network throughout the region. The island's ring railway has also been built in phases, of which the Yulin-Yinggehai section has been opened to traffic.

With the change of production relations and the liberation of productive forces, Hainan's industrial and agricultural production level has been continuously improved. In 1949, the total industrial and agricultural output value of the island was only 184.46 million yuan, of which the industrial proportion accounted for only 12.3%; by the end of the first Five-Year Plan period, the total industrial and agricultural output value rose to 399.22 million yuan. After the Great Leap Forward, the total industrial and agricultural output value in 1959 jumped to 764.29 million yuan, of which the industrial proportion reached 50%. Under the guidance of the policy of taking grain as the center and combining grain with diversified operations, grain production has been greatly developed. In 1952, the total grain output reached 1.19 billion jin. During the first Five-Year Plan period, it increased at an average annual rate of 7.88%, reaching 1.75 billion jin in 1957. During the continuous Great Leap Forward in 1958-1959, grain output increased at an average annual rate of 26%, reaching an annual output of 2.78 billion jin. In ten years, grain production increased 2.4 times, thus changing the historical situation in Hainan where grain could not be self-sufficient. At the same time, various cash crops, animal husbandry, and aquaculture have also grown rapidly: peanut production increased by two times, sugarcane increased by fifteen times, sesame increased by three times, jute increased by seven times, cattle increased by 80%, pigs increased by nearly one time, and aquatic products increased by three times.

With the development of production, the unemployment phenomenon of the old society has been eliminated, and the people's material and cultural life has been improving year by year. The average wage of employees in factories and mines has increased by about 50%, and the average income of farmers has increased by more than one and a half times compared with before the land reform. A total of 600,000 young people on the island have been freed from illiteracy, and more than 96% of school-age children have enrolled in school. The number of primary school students has increased from 160,000 to 400,000, the number of middle school students has increased from 7,000 to 65,000, and five universities and colleges have been established. A health care network has been established in the vast rural areas.

The great achievements of Hainan's construction over the past decade have irrefutably proved the enormous superiority of the socialist system, the correctness of the General Line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, the great achievements of the Great Leap Forward, and the enormous power of the People’s Communes. In the past ten years, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee headed

    高举毛泽东思想旗帜继续跃进
    中共广东省委书记兼海南区党委第一书记　林李明
    5月1日是国际劳动节，又是广东省海南岛解放十周年的纪念日。“人逢喜事精神爽”，在这样一个有双重喜庆的节日里，海南人民怀着难以形容的兴奋心情，歌颂伟大的节日，歌颂十年伟大的胜利；同时，满怀着坚定的信心，高举着毛泽东思想旗帜，沿着社会主义建设总路线、大跃进、人民公社的道路继续迈进。
    从1927年起，海南人民为争取自己的解放，在中国共产党的领导下，曾经坚持了长期的、艰苦的、前仆后继的反帝反封建反官僚资本主义的斗争，曾经成立了工农民主政权，组织了人民革命武装，建立了革命根据地，在孤岛上坚持了二十多年的斗争。1950年五一节的前夕，英雄的人民解放军，在统一全国大陆后，又以排山倒海的雄姿，征服了波涛汹涌的琼州海峡，消灭了盘据在岛上的国民党反动匪帮。从此，海南进入了一个新的历史时期。
    十年来，同全国各地一样，海南经历了巨大的深刻的变化。在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，在广东省委的正确领导下，全岛三百万各族人民和守卫海南岛的人民解放军官兵，迅速地荡涤反动政府留下来的污泥浊水，治好战争的创伤，进行了社会主义改造和社会主义建设，取得了政治战线、经济战线和思想战线上社会主义革命的决定性胜利，特别是经过1958—1959年的连续大跃进，各项工作都有了飞跃的发展。海南岛在短短的十年内，已经根本改变了面貌。
    生产资料所有制的变革，消灭了封建主义和资本主义的人剥削人的生产关系，建立了社会主义的生产关系，这是十年来最根本的变化。我们和全国各地一样，开展了土地改革、镇压反革命和各项民主改革运动，接着又进行了对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。土地改革前，仅占全岛人口3.6％的地主，占有全岛耕地30％以上；还占有大量的耕畜农具，残酷地剥削农民的劳动。土改后，全岛一百六十万无地和少地的贫、雇农和下中农，每人平均分得一亩七分地，并分得大批耕畜农具等生产资料。接着对分散的农业、手工业个体经济进行了改造，改变为社会主义集体经济，使农民和小生产者永远摆脱了贫困和剥削；将私营的工商业改造为社会主义企业。这样，就把多种经济改变为单一的社会主义经济，取得了经济战线上社会主义革命的决定性胜利。1958年在总路线和大跃进的鼓舞下，生产的规模不断扩大，原来的农业生产合作社已经不能适应形势的需要，迅速在农村实现了人民公社化。全岛二千三百八十个高级社合并建立了一百四十二个人民公社。
    旧的生产关系的改变，新的社会主义生产关系的建立，解放了生产力，促进了生产力的迅速发展。在这期间，党和政府采取了各种措施恢复和发展生产力，投放大量的基本建设资金和设备。从1952年到1959年，国家对海南的基本建设投资达七亿元，国营农场的投资达二亿八千万元，解放前，由于封建统治剥削，天灾人祸，农业生产力受到很大的破坏，而占全岛面积一半的少数民族地区，还处在“刀耕火种”、牛踩田手捻稻的原始耕作阶段。随着土地改革的完成，互助合作运动和公社化运动的开展，加上国家的支持，农业生产力得到巨大的发展。党和政府除积极恢复、发展耕畜外，还大力推广新式农具，进行工具改革，推广新的耕作技术，贯彻农业八字宪法。十年来，推广新式犁三十二万部，双铧犁三万部，牛车、手推车一百万部和大批中耕器、打谷机、播种机等。现在国营农场和拖拉机站共有拖拉机一千一百标准台，机械排灌七千六百马力。这是实现农业机械化的基础。
    解放前，全岛几乎没有什么水利工程基础，水土流失极为严重，雨量虽多而常遭严重干旱威胁。十年来，特别是大跃进以来，全岛人民以“要高山低头，河水让路”的英雄气概，开展水利建设工作，共完成大小水利工程十二万余宗，灌溉面积达二百一十八万亩，特别是在中央和省委的领导和支持下，海南的三大水利工程之一——松涛水库已开工修建，其余两大水库——加兴岭和佳?也将陆续兴建。不久的将来，全岛的水利网、电力网将因三大水库的建成而建立起来。
    海南是我国罕有的热带地区，应该大力发展各种热带经济作物以适应国家社会主义建设的需要。十年来，在中央和省委的大力支持下，农垦事业有很大的进展，国营农场星罗棋布。几年来，开垦荒地数百万亩。现在全岛热带作物的种植面积比解放前扩大二十倍左右。其中被称为“世界油王”的油棕，种植面积比解放前扩大一万倍，咖啡扩大一百倍，香料作物扩大三百倍。
    解放前，海南几乎没有什么现代工业。现在，不但有轻工业、食品工业、热带作物加工业，而且有了钢铁、机械制造、水泥、采煤、木材、炼油等工业。由于大搞技术革命和技术革新的结果，生产能力不断提高，新产品大量试制出来。新建的现代化的工厂共有一百四十七个。以石碌铁矿为中心的钢铁联合企业正在逐步建设，目前年产六万吨的水泥厂已投入生产。至于公社工业则更是遍地开花。
    在交通运输方面，全岛已修复和新建公路六千余公里，平均每五平方公里有一公里的公路，相当于解放前的七倍。现在环岛公路和纵贯南北、东西的公路已修通，构成全区的公路网。环岛铁路亦已分期修建，其中榆（林）英（歌海）段已经通车。
    随着生产关系的改变，生产力的解放，海南的工农业生产水平已获得不断提高。1949年，全岛工农业总产值只有一亿八千四百四十六万元，其中工业比重只占12.3％；到第一个五年计划期末，工农业总产值上升为三亿九千九百二十二万元，经过大跃进，1959年的工农业总产值跃升为七亿六千四百二十九万元，其中工业比重已达50％。在以粮食为中心，粮食和多种经营并举的方针指导下，粮食生产有极大的发展，1952年粮食总产量已达到十一亿九千万斤，在第一个五年计划期间，平均每年以递增7.88％的速度，1957年达到十七亿五千万斤。1958—1959年连续两年大跃进，粮食产量又以平均每年递增26％的速度，达到年产二十七亿八千万斤。十年间，粮食增长二点四倍，这样改变了海南历史上粮食不能自给的状况。在此同时，各种经济作物、畜牧业、水产业也有很快的增长：花生增长两倍，甘蔗增长十五倍，芝麻增长三倍，黄麻增长七倍，牛增长80％，生猪增长近一倍，水产增长三倍。
    随着生产的发展，旧社会的失业现象消灭了，人民的物质和文化生活在逐年提高。厂矿企业职工平均工资增长50％左右，农民的平均收入比土地改革前增长一倍半以上。全岛已有六十万青年脱离文盲状态，96％以上的适龄儿童都入了学，小学生从十六万人增到四十万，中学生由七千人增加到六万五千人，还建立了五所大专学校。广大的农村已建立了卫生保健网。
    十年来，海南建设的伟大成就无可辩驳地证明了社会主义制度的巨大优越性，证明了鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的正确性、大跃进的伟大成绩和人民公社的巨大威力。在这十年里，我们在以毛主席为首的党中央英明的领导下，在省委的直接领导下，取得了极丰富的经验，主要的是坚决贯彻执行党的路线、方针、政策，运用总路线、人民公社、大跃进三大法宝不断加强党的领导，开展两条路线的斗争，这是我们取得胜利的根本保证；事事都依靠群众，放手发动群众，大搞群众运动和改进干部领导作风和工作方法，这也是我们取得胜利的源泉和力量。
    今后，我们将要继续高举毛泽东思想的旗帜，坚决地热烈地响应八届八中全会的号召，要在未来的十年内把海南变成祖国热带作物的宝库和美丽富饶的热带花园与热带油料、原料、用料、香料、饮料的基地；要在三年左右的时间基本完成全岛开垦定植任务；要在今年内完成过去十年的工作量，热带作物种植面积翻一番，这是我们全岛各族人民在欢庆海南解放十周年的宏伟愿望。
