Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 28th: Soviet newspapers commemorated the 42nd anniversary of the founding of the border guards today. Articles published here pointed out that border guards should redouble their vigilance, defend the motherland's borders, and be ready to strike at invading enemies at any time.

    An article in "Red Star" said that the Soviet state, like other socialist countries, still faces the danger of aggression from imperialist countries. As long as imperialist military bases exist around the Soviet border, we must do our best to ensure that the motherland's land is not violated. The recent American aggression against the Soviet Union once again proves the importance of this task. The article also exposed the fact that American-Turkish armed spies appeared on the southern border of the Soviet Union not long ago.

    The article said that during the years of socialist peaceful construction, more than a dozen border guard units and hundreds of border guards were awarded medals for their outstanding performance in defending the motherland's borders, and eighteen border guards were awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union.

    An article in "Soviet Naval News" pointed out that the bellicose American imperialism also surrounds the Soviet Union and other socialist countries with military bases. They have schools for training spies in many capitalist countries, and American imperialism has made espionage its national policy. The American aggressive bloc intensified its espionage activities on the eve of the Four-Power Summit. The Pentagon and the CIA, with the consent of the US President and Secretary of State, did everything they could to sabotage the summit.

    The article said that in recent years, the Soviet Union has greatly surpassed the United States in decisive scientific and technological sectors. Therefore, the American ruling group frantically attempts to obtain various materials about Soviet industry and armed forces. However, all the conspiracies of foreign spies have failed, and the Soviet border guards vigilantly guard the border.

    An article in "Soviet Air Force News" said that these days, when all the Soviet people are aroused with boundless anger by the shameless espionage activities of the American war provocateurs, the glorious Soviet border guards have tenfold increased their vigilance and are working harder to improve their combat training.

    A short article in "Pravda" said that Soviet border guards are completing the task of defending the border in close cooperation with the working people in the border areas. Now, in many border villages in the Soviet Union, people's volunteer patrols have been established, and they assist the border guards in jointly defending the border. Maintaining close ties with the people is the source of strength of the border troops.

    苏联报纸纪念边防军成立四十二周年
    苏联军人加倍警惕保卫祖国
    当好战的美帝国主义用军事基地包围社会主义国家、在许多国家设有间谍学校，还把间谍活动作为国策的时候，苏联边防军十倍地提高了警惕性。
    新华社莫斯科28日电　今天是苏联边防军成立四十二周年纪念日。这里的报纸就此发表的文章指出，边防军人应该加倍提高警惕，保卫祖国边疆，随时准备打击来犯的敌人。
      “红星报”发表的一篇文章说，苏维埃国家同其他社会主义国家一样还存在着来自帝国主义国家侵犯的危险。当苏联国境周围还存在着帝国主义军事基地的时候，我们必须尽力保证祖国土地不受侵犯。最近美国对苏联的侵略行动，又一次证明这一任务的重要性。文章还揭露了不久前在苏联南部国境线上出现美国—土耳其武装间谍的事实。
    文章说，在社会主义和平建设年代里，有十多个边防部队和成百名边防战士因出色地完成了保卫祖国边境的任务获得了奖章，有十八名边防战士获得了苏联英雄称号。
      “苏联海军报”的文章指出，好战的美帝国主义还用军事基地包围着苏联和其他社会主义国家，他们在许多资本主义国家设有训练间谍的学校，美帝国主义还把间谍活动作为自己的国策，美国侵略集团在四国政府首脑会议前夕加紧了间谍活动，五角大楼和美国中央情报局在美国总统和国务卿同意下为了破坏首脑会议作了一切能作的事情。
    文章说，近年来，苏联在有决定意义的科学技术部门大大超过了美国，因此美国统治集团疯狂地企图获得苏联工业和武装力量的各种材料。然而，外国间谍分子的一切阴谋都失败了，苏联边防军警惕地守卫着国境。
    “苏联空军报”的一篇文章说，这几天，当全苏人民被美国战争挑拨者的无耻间谍活动激起无比愤怒的时候，光荣的苏联边防军十倍地提高了自己的警惕性，正在以更大的努力完善自己的战斗训练。
    “真理报”在一篇短文中说，苏联边防战士是在同边防地区劳动人民紧密合作下完成保卫国境的任务的。现在苏联许多国境线上的村子里，已经成立了人民志愿纠察队，他们协助边防军共同保卫国境。同人民保持紧密的联系，是边防部队的力量所在。
