Xinhua News Agency, May 26th dispatch from New York (TASS): Many Americans continue to express indignation at the aggressive policies of the US government. Numerous letters to the editor published in various newspapers testify to this.

    The "Des Moines Register" published a letter from Larsen, a reader in Iowa, entitled "Khrushchev Has the Right to Demand an Apology." The letter stated, "Khrushchev has every right to demand an apology from the United States for this kind of behavior (violating Soviet airspace), because this behavior can only be justified by quoting Hitler's 'Mein Kampf'. Eisenhower should not only apologize to the Soviet Union, but also to the whole world and the American people."

    Detroit resident Kirby, in a letter published in the "News," condemned "the clumsy explanations of government spokesmen defending the flight of American spy planes." Kirby said, "Our president shamelessly defends this behavior, saying it is necessary to prevent a surprise attack. In doing so, he completely ignores the resolution on disarmament recently adopted by the United Nations General Assembly."

    Connell of Chicago wrote in the "Chicago Tribune," "Any objective person would consider the spy incident an act of aggression, and the most foolish act of aggression."

    The "Washington Post" published a letter from reader Washburn, who, in talking about the "welcome" Eisenhower received upon returning to Washington, wrote, "I was embarrassed by the appearance of the Washington fire engine parked at the corner of 14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, with a large banner hanging on the fire engine's ladder that read: 'Thank you, Mr. President.' Thank you for what? Since when do fire departments thank people who play with fire and are caught red-handed while doing so?"

    Many Americans, in letters to their state and district congressmen and senators, expressed extreme dissatisfaction with the US government's sabotage of the summit conference. Senator Muskie stated in Congress that he receives many such letters every day. One letter from Maine stated that it was the US government that "sabotaged the summit conference," and that "Eisenhower has no right to subject the United States to such shame. The whole incident makes me angry."

    美国公众谴责政府挑衅政策
    指出艾森豪威尔是当场被捉的放火犯
    新华社26日讯　据塔斯社纽约25日讯：许多美国人对美国政府的侵略政策继续表示愤慨。各报登载的许多读者来信就证明了这点。
    “得梅因纪事报”以“赫鲁晓夫有权要求道歉”为题发表了衣阿华州一位读者拉森的信。信中写道，“赫鲁晓夫有充分权利要求美国对这种（侵犯苏联领空的）行为道歉，因为，这种行为只能引用希特勒的
  ‘我的奋斗’一书来进行辩护。艾森豪威尔不仅应当在苏联面前道歉，而且应当在全世界和美国人民面前道歉”。
    底特律的居民克尔比在“新闻报”上发表的一封信中谴责“政府发言人为美国间谍飞机飞行辩护的拙劣的解释”。克尔比说，“我们的总统竟厚颜无耻地为这种行为辩护，说这是防止突然袭击所必需的。他这样做，完全忽视不久前联合国大会所通过的关于裁军问题的决议”。
    芝加哥的康奈尔在“芝加哥论坛报”上写道，“任何一个客观的人都会认为，间谍活动事件是侵略的行为，并且是最愚蠢的侵略行为。”
      “华盛顿邮报”刊登了读者沃希伯恩的来信，信中在谈到艾森豪威尔回到华盛顿那天的“欢迎”情况时写道，“停在第十四街和宾夕法尼亚大街拐角处的华盛顿救火车的外貌使我怪难为情，在救火车的梯子上还挂着一幅大标语，上面写着：‘谢谢，总统先生’。谢什么呢？从什么时候开始消防队要向玩火的人而且是在放火时被当场捉住的人表示感谢的呢？”
    许多美国人在给本州和本区的众议员和参议员的信中，对美国政府破坏首脑会议表示极为不满。参议员马斯基在国会中发言说，他每天都收到许多这类信件。缅因州有一封来信写道，正是美国政府“破坏了首脑会议”，“艾森豪威尔没有任何权利使美国蒙受这样的耻辱。这整个事件都使我感到愤怒。”
