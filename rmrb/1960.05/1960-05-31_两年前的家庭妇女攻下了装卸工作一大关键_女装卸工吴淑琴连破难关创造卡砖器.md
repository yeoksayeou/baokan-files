    Two Years Ago, a Housewife Conquered a Key Aspect of Loading and Unloading Work
    Female Stevedore Wu Shuqin Overcame Obstacles and Created a Brick-Clamping Device
    (By Our Newspaper) Beijing, Haidian District female stevedore Wu Shuqin, after thirteen revisions and more than one hundred trials, successfully created a simple structure, easy to use, and low-cost brick loading and unloading tool – the brick-clamping device.
    For a long time, stevedores have been using a simple brick clamp, carrying bricks by hand to load and unload them. This tool could only clamp four bricks at a time. To load a truck, it required 375 trips. During this mass movement for loading and unloading mechanization, transportation workers created many kinds of brick loading and unloading tools, but none of them were widely used due to excessive steel consumption, high cost, and the tendency to break bricks. Wu Shuqin's brick-clamping device can be made with only about 40 kilograms of flat iron, costing only 38 yuan including labor and materials. It can lift more than 300 bricks onto a truck at once. With it, stevedores only need to do light work like hooking and unhooking, increasing loading and unloading efficiency by 40% and saving workers half the labor.
    Wu Shuqin, the creator of the brick-clamping device, is a housewife who recently shed her illiteracy, a former child bride. She left her cooking pot and took up a labor post during the Great Leap Forward in 1958.
    At the beginning of this year, with the increase in basic construction tasks, the freight volume of bricks increased sharply. Manual brick transportation was exhausting and still couldn't keep up with demand. Wu Shuqin thought, "When will they invent a brick loading tool so that bricks can be lifted by a crane?" When the city-wide upsurge of technical innovation and technical revolution arrived, Wu Shuqin, disregarding her recent liberation from illiteracy, only knowing addition, subtraction, and multiplication in arithmetic, not division, and being technically ignorant, was determined to create a brick loading tool. She became obsessed with it. Whether working, eating, walking, or sleeping, she was always thinking about the brick loading tool. For three consecutive nights, she got up in the middle of the night to draw designs and make models. Finally, she produced an immature draft. When the leadership learned about this, they immediately transferred her to the Haidian District Loading and Unloading Machinery Technical Revolution Group and assigned stevedore Zheng Wenming to help her with trial production.
    During the trial production, the equipment used was only a baking oven, a few sledgehammers, and four iron bars. Whether cutting iron, joining lengths, or drilling holes, it was all done according to the methods of a small blacksmith shop. The brick-clamping device they initially made could clamp a maximum of 128 bricks at a time, still far from the requirement of "not being excessive for a ton." An old worker in the group suggested that they change the brick-clamping device from clamping on two sides to clamping on four sides, which could load hundreds more bricks. After it was made, it was tested dozens of times, but the bricks in the middle always sagged like the bottom of a pot. At this time, some people made sarcastic remarks: "What technical revolution is this? It's purely a waste of materials. They're ruining the little material we have." Hearing these words, Zheng Wenming lost his temper, threw down his hammer, and refused to continue. The Party gave Wu Shuqin great support. The branch secretary of the Transportation Business Office encouraged her, saying, "If you want to make revolution, you must have a rubber head and not be afraid of bumps."
    With everyone's help, Wu Shuqin went through ten consecutive failures. Some people made sarcastic remarks about Wu Shuqin. Master Zhang, who was working with Wu Shuqin on the trial production, also began to lose confidence. At this time, the director of the Technical Revolution Office of the Transportation Command of the Haidian District Party Committee immediately assigned three technicians to form a special research group with her. After a week of hard work and three more revisions, they finally successfully trial-produced this brick-clamping device.
    The birth of the brick-clamping device once again proves the truth that "the lowliest are the most intelligent," and at the same time powerfully breaks the prejudice against women left over from the old society. As long as millions of people like Wu Shuqin dare to break superstitions, liberate their minds, and have tenacious revolutionary drive, they will surely create miracles. (Attached picture)

    两年前的家庭妇女攻下了装卸工作一大关键
    女装卸工吴淑琴连破难关创造卡砖器
    本报讯　北京海淀区女装卸工吴淑琴，经过十三次修改、一百多次试验，创造成功一种结构简单、使用方便、成本低廉的装卸砖工具——卡砖器。
    长期以来，装卸工人都是用一种简单的砖卡子，用手提着装砖卸砖。这种工具每次只能卡四块砖。装满一卡车，需要搬运三百七十五次。在这次大搞装卸机械化运动中，交通运输战线的职工们曾经创造了许多种装卸砖工具，但都因钢材消耗太多、成本太贵、容易碎砖等原因，一直没有推广使用。吴淑琴创造的卡砖器，只要四十公斤左右的扁铁就能做成一套，连工带料只花三十八元钱。它一下就能把三百多块砖吊到汽车上，装卸工人用它装卸砖，只需做一些挂钩、摘钩等轻便劳动，装卸效率提高40％，工人节省一半。
    创造卡砖器的吴淑琴，是个刚刚摘掉文盲帽子、昔日做过童养媳的家庭妇女，1958年大跃进的时候，刚刚离开锅台走上劳动岗位。
    今年年初，随着基本建设任务的增加，砖的货运量骤然猛增。人工运砖，累得满头大汗，还是赶不上需要。吴淑琴想：“什么时候发明一种装砖工具，用起重机吊砖就好了。”当全市技术革新、技术革命高潮到来时，吴淑琴不顾自己刚刚摘掉文盲帽子，算术只会加、减、乘，不会除，技术一窍不通等困难，下定决心要创造一种装砖工具。她像着了迷一样，不论是干活、吃饭、走路或是睡觉，心里都在琢磨装砖工具。一连三个晚上，她都是半夜起床，画样子，作模型。最后，终于画成一份不成熟的草图。领导上知道这件事情，立刻把她调到海淀区装卸机具技术革命组，并且派装卸工人郑文明帮助她进行试制。
    试制当中，所用的设备，只有一盘烘炉、几把大锤和四根铁棍，不论截铁、接长、打眼，都是按照小铁匠铺的办法进行。他们起初制成的卡砖器，一次最多能卡一百二十八块砖，距离“吨不过分”的要求仍然很远。组里的一位老工人建议他们把两面夹的卡砖器改成四面夹的，可以多装几百块砖。制成以后，试验了几十次，结果都是四面的砖吊起来了，中间的砖总是像锅底似的下沉。这时有人说闲话了：“这叫什么技术革命，纯粹是浪费材料。好容易找到点料，都让他们糟塌了。”听了这些话，郑文明沉不住气，摔下铁锤不干了。党给了吴淑琴很大的支持。运输营业所的支部书记鼓励她说：“要想闹革命，就得长个橡皮脑袋，不怕磕碰。”
    在大家的帮助下，吴淑琴连续经过十次失败。有的人说吴淑琴的风凉话了；和吴淑琴一起进行试制的张师傅也有些失去信心。这时，中共海淀区委运输指挥部技术革命办公室主任立即指定三个技工和她一起组成专门研究小组。经过一周苦战，又修改了三次，终于把这套卡砖器试制成功了。
    卡砖器诞生的事实，再次证明了“卑贱者最聪明”的真理，同时有力地破除了旧社会遗留下来的歧视妇女的偏见。千千万万像吴淑琴这样的人，只要她们敢于破除迷信，解放思想，具有顽强的革命干劲，她们就一定能创造出奇迹。（附图片）
