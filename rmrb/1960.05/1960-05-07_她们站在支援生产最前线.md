They Stand on the Forefront of Supporting Production
Xu Haiqing, First Secretary of the CCP Liangping County Committee, Sichuan

	It was ten o'clock at night. The comrades of the Lirang Women's Distribution Store had been busy all day. They had closed the books and were concentrating on studying. Outside the door, it was raining heavily, suddenly turning into a thunderstorm, with strong winds rising and lightning flashing across the earth, making everything visible. The wheat in the fields, still in bud and sprouting, was swaying precariously in the wind. The girls all automatically stopped studying, looking at the sky and the earth, their heads raised, their feet stamping, their faces full of anxiety. "Will the wheat be damaged? How can we salvage it? What should we do?" This series of questions quickly jumped into the hearts of each of the girls. The situation was so urgent, and at that moment, no one suggested what to do. They were temporarily silent for a few minutes. The manager was the first to shout out: "Comrades! We must immediately send rain gear to the commune members and help all the commune members to rescue the wheat...!"

	All the comrades in the store responded in unison and immediately took action. Li Fangbi and Hua Yongxian rushed out of the door first, waking up workers and small vendors along the street, convening an emergency mobilization meeting, and organizing a temporary support team; Yang Huayu from the means of production sales department was counting bamboo hats; Mao Shixian was taking out straw raincoats, carrying baskets, and taking carrying poles..., each one was incessantly tying, bundling, and loading the goods. In an instant, arrangements were made, and more than five thousand pieces of rain gear were divided into five detachments and set off for the vast wheat fields.

	The thunder stopped, and the lightning also stopped, but the wind and rain continued to roar. And the road was particularly slippery! How dark the night was at this time! They carried the goods, moving forward step by step, occasionally hearing the sound of "plop, plop" as people fell to the ground, and the faint sound of "Get up and walk quickly!" They were advancing urgently, they did not take a breath, their clothes were all wet, but how hot their hearts were! Their wish was to deliver the rain gear to the district teams as soon as possible and participate in rescuing the wheat with the commune members! The rain gear was delivered to the commune members one by one, and the commune members were delighted!

	At about one o'clock, the wind gradually subsided, and the rain was still falling. At this time, the fields were brilliantly lit, and the noise of tens of thousands of people and the sound of bamboo poles being inserted were mixed together, resounding throughout the hills. They were working selflessly, wholeheartedly to rescue the lodged wheat. All the comrades of the distribution store participated in the work of rescuing the wheat. Li Fangbi worked even more happily in the central district team. She single-handedly supported more than one mu of wheat and humorously encouraged the commune members, saying: "This plot of wheat will yield 800 catties per mu this year. Because it has also experienced wind and rain, it has lived through the battle!" This made everyone laugh heartily. At the same time, they also mended fifteen torn straw raincoats for the commune members, protecting their health.

	The Lirang Women's Distribution Store has a system: everyone who goes to the countryside to deliver goods brings a dustpan and manure hoe to collect dog manure for the district team and send it to the fields.

	In spring, when hundreds of flowers are in full bloom, the warm sunshine makes people particularly energetic. Mao Shixian from the distribution store rolled up her sleeves and trousers, walked barefoot, carrying a load of goods on her back and a dustpan in her hand, heading towards the Qihe district team. She picked up manure as she walked, and in less than half a day, she had filled a large dustpan.

	In front of Zhangjia Courtyard in the Qihe district team, a large crowd of people were gathered, feverishly shoveling sod and digging mud to accumulate fertilizer and make fertilizer. The female commune member Liu Fangxu saw Mao Shixian walking towards them with a large basket of heavy things from afar. They all thought she was delivering goods. The commune members shouted and asked, wanting to buy this and that, and the children from the nursery also gathered around, preparing to buy their favorite things. Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be a dustpan full of dog manure, and they all burst into laughter. The commune members jokingly said, "Does the distribution store also sell dog manure?" Mao Shixian replied, "No! We picked it up and brought it along the way while delivering goods to the countryside." Before they finished speaking, Comrade Mao Shixian put down the goods on her back, rolled up her trouser legs to her thighs, and waded into the paddy field with a rustling sound. She poured the dog manure into the manure pit, and then she held the new-style plow in her hands, plowing the field, then harrowing the field, and then building the field ridges. She was truly capable in everything, just like a male comrade.

	It was getting dark, and Mao Shixian came out of the field. Commune member Liu Longguo had already prepared tea for her and specially made a bowl of buckwheat cake for her to eat. Mao Shixian took advantage of the time when work was over to open the package of goods and started doing business. The commune members unanimously composed a folk rhyme, with lyrics that said:

	The east wind sends warmth and the rapeseed flowers are fragrant,
	Everyone is busy for production;
	The girl delivers goods and accumulates fertilizer,
	Supporting agricultural production.
	Thanks to the good leadership of the Party,
	Thanks to the commerce for the help;
	The granaries are full, celebrating a bumper year,
	Happy days will be endless.

                    *

	The lack of farm tools and pig iron in the spring plowing and production was a major concern for the comrades of the Lirang Women's Distribution Store day and night. Manager Yang Yubo considered it even more, almost forgetting to eat and sleep. They mobilized the workers to find solutions and launched a campaign of "one person, one idea, ten people, a hundred ideas," providing thousands of rationalization proposals.

	One noon, Yang Huayu thought for a long time in her bedroom. She suddenly thought: "The earth furnace group had a lot of high-sulfur sub-iron and unseparated pig iron slag left over. How wonderful it would be if they could be used in large quantities!" She figured it out, rushed out of the door, and told the workers her opinion.

	They used the steel-making furnace to "re-smelt" high-sulfur sub-iron and slag iron. The first time, due to the low furnace temperature, the iron produced was oxidized, and the sulfur and slag content were still very high. They tried a second time, increasing the wind speed and reducing the pressure, and the firepower soared to 1,100 degrees. Suddenly, the furnace body ruptured, and sparks shot out, almost burning the workers in front of the furnace and the bellows workers. Look: how resourceful and brave they were, each one rushed forward, tying the furnace body with iron wire, pasting the furnace body with salt mud, guarding the fire door, and they continued to work as usual.

	"We must get good iron out of the steel-making furnace!" "Everything is for producing more farm tools!" This was the wish of all the girls. Comrade Jia Chenghai, the secretary of the local supply and marketing cooperative branch, also supported this idea and encouraged them to try again and again! However, day after day passed, and night after night passed, the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth times all passed, but good iron still did not come out. The workers were somewhat disappointed and suggested not continuing. Finally, they insisted on a seventh experiment. They considered: boldly using "gang charcoal" as fuel, changing a single bellows to a double bellows, increasing the air volume, and the furnace temperature rose all the way to 1,500 degrees and 1,600 degrees. At this time, the first furnace of iron that met the quality standards flowed out, and they all jumped up.

	In this way, the Lirang Women's Distribution Store used discarded high-sulfur sub-iron and slag iron to refine good pig iron. During the current spring plowing and production, they refined more than 50,000 catties of iron in total, produced more than 30,000 pieces of iron farm tools of twenty-eight types, meeting the needs of the vast number of commune members.

    她们站在支援生产最前线
    中共四川梁平县委第一书记　徐海清
    夜十点了，礼让女子分销店全体同志忙碌了一天，扎好账，正在集中学习。门外下着大雨，突然转为雷雨交加，狂风四起，电光闪映着大地，什么都看得清楚，田里含苞吐穗的小麦，被狂风吹得摇摇欲坠。姑娘们都自动停止了学习，看望着天空，眺望着大地，一个个昂首顿足，脸上充满了焦急。“小麦会不会损失？怎么挽救？我们又该做些什么？”这一连串的问题很快地就在每个姑娘们的心坎上跳动了。情况这么紧迫，在那一刹那，又没有人提出来该怎么办才好，她们暂时静默了几分钟。经理第一个喊了出来：“同志们！我们要立即送去雨具给社员，帮助所有社员都来抢救……！”
    全店同志齐声答应，马上行动起来。李芳碧和华永贤抢先跨出了大门，沿街逐户叫醒了工人和小商贩，召开了紧急动员会议，组织临时支援大队；生产资料门市部的杨华玉在清点斗笠；毛世先在取蓑衣，拿皮箩，取扁担……，一个个脚不停手不住地在捆帮，装成了货担。霎时，安排就绪，五千多件雨具，分成五个支队，向那辽阔的麦田出发了。
    雷声停了，闪电也停了，但是风雨仍然在继续咆哮。而路是格外的滑！夜，这时是多么黑啊！她们担着货，一步步地往前行进，一会儿只听得“扑通、扑通”跌人下地的声音，和那低微的“快起来走！”的声音，她们在急促地前进，她们没有喘过一口气，她们的衣服全部都打湿了，她们的心是多么的热啊！她们的心愿是快一点将雨具送到区队，同社员共同参加抢救小麦！雨具一个个地都送到社员手中了，社员们乐欢了！
    下一点钟左右，风渐渐地小了，雨还在下着，这时的田野，一片灯光辉煌，数以万计的人们喧哗声和那扦竹竿声混在一起，响彻了整个山岗，他们在忘我地劳动，一心一意地为了抢救倒伏的小麦。分销店全体同志都参加了抢救小麦的工作，李芳碧在中心区队劳动得更欢，她一人一气扶起了小麦一亩多，还风趣地鼓励着社员说：“这块小麦今年要亩产八百斤。因为它也是经过了风吹雨打，是在战斗中生活过来的啊！”逗引得大家哈哈大笑起来。同时她们还为社员们缝补了烂蓑衣十五件，保护了他们的身体健康。
    礼让女子分销店有一种制度：凡是下乡送货的都带上一个撮箕、屎锄，为区队拣狗屎、送狗屎下田。
    春天，百花盛开，和暖的阳光照得人们格外起劲，分销店的毛世先捞衣卷裤，滑着赤脚，背着货担，手提撮箕向齐合区队走去，她一路走，一路拣，不到半天时间，就拣满了一大提撮箕。
    齐合区队张家院门前，正簇拥着一大堆人群，他们正在热火朝天地铲草皮，挖脚泥，忙着积肥造肥，女社员刘芳绪远远地看见毛世先手提着一大提篮沉甸甸的东西，迎面走来，他们都认为是送货来的，社员们喊的喊，问的问，要买这买那，托儿所的小朋友们也都相继围拢来，准备买上他们自己心爱的东西。临近一看，原来是满满一撮箕狗屎，他们都乐开了，社员们发趣的说：“分销店还经卖狗屎吗？”毛世先回答说：“不！这是我们送货下乡顺便拣起送来的。”他们的话还没有讲完，毛世先同志就放下背上的货物，把裤脚卷到大腿，哗啦哗啦地往水田里走着。她把狗屎倒入了粪坑，接着就手扶着新式犁在犁田，一会又在耙田，一会又在打田坎，真是样样都行，也能干，硬像一个男同志。
    天快要黑了，毛世先从田里走出来，社员刘隆国早已为她准备了茶水，还特地为她作了一碗荞粑给她吃。毛世先趁收工的时候，还将货包打开，做起了生意。社员们不约而同地编出一个顺口溜，歌词道：
    东风送暖菜花香，
    人人都为生产忙；
    姑娘送货又积肥，
    支援农业大生产。
    多谢党的好领导，
    多谢商业来帮忙；
    五谷满仓庆丰年，
    幸福日子永无疆。
                    *
    春耕大生产缺乏农具，缺乏毛铁。这是礼让女子分销店同志们日夜担心的一件大事。经理杨玉伯考虑得更多，几乎废寝忘餐。她们发动了工人想办法，开展了一人一条计，十人百条计的运动，提供了数以千计的合理化建议。
    一天中午，杨华玉在寝室里想了老半天，她忽然想着了：“土高炉群曾剩下很多高硫次铁和铁渣不分的生铁，要是能大量利用的话，是多么好啊！”她想开了，她猛地出门，向工人们说出了自己的意见。
    她们用炼土钢的炉子在“回锅”高硫次铁和渣铁。第一次由于炉温低的关系，出的铁是氧化的，含硫量和含渣量仍很大，她们又试第二次，加快了风速压量，火力猛升一千一百度，忽然炉身爆裂，火花迸射，险些将炉前工和风箱工人烧着了。你看：她们多么机智勇敢，一个个都抢上前去，用铁丝捆着炉身，用盐泥糊着炉身，看守着火门，她们照旧地工作着。
    “要从炼钢炉里拿出好铁来！”“一切为了多生产农具！”这是全体姑娘们的心愿。当场供销社支部书记贾成波同志也支持了这个意见，并鼓励她们再试再试！可是，一天天地过去了，一夜夜地过去了，第三次、四次、五次、六次都过去了，好铁仍没有出来。工人们都有些失望了，提议不再搞下去，终于她们坚持了第七次的试验。她们考虑着：大胆地用了“杠炭”做燃料，改单风箱为双风箱，风量加大了，炉温一直升到一千五百度，一千六百度，这时，第一炉符合质量的铁流了出来，她们都跳了起来。
    礼让女子分销店就这样利用了废弃的高硫次铁和渣铁炼出了好的毛铁。她们在当前春耕大生产时共炼出铁五万多斤，制出铁器农具二十八种，三万多件，满足了广大社员的需要。
