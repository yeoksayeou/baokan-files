The Wengan Jiashan Coal Mine has successfully trial-produced seventy-two kinds of products from the original coal tar, coke oven wastewater discharged from coking kilns, and other waste materials.

In February, the Jiashan Coal Mine formed a chemical engineering team to vigorously promote the comprehensive utilization of coal and extract artificial petroleum. After more than twenty days of research, they extracted products such as gasoline, kerosene, light and heavy diesel oil from the original coal tar. Subsequently, they extracted liquid fuels such as crude benzene, crude toluene, crude xylene, and solvent oil from the primary distilled gasoline. They also used waste acid and waste alkali solutions to extract twelve new products, including phenolic compounds and lubricating grease. Recently, they also used coke oven wastewater discharged from coking kilns, zinc skins from discarded batteries, manganese powder, battery copper caps, and lime to trial-produce fifty-two products, including chemical fertilizers and chemical and pharmaceutical raw materials.

    从焦水中提取化工原料
    瓮安夹山煤厂，从原焦油及炼焦窑排除的焦水和其他废物中，试制成功七十二种产品。
    夹山煤厂在2月份就组成了化工小组，大搞煤炭综合利用，提炼人造石油。他们经过二十多天的钻研，从原焦油中提炼出了汽油、煤油、轻重柴油等产品。接着又从初馏汽油中提出了初苯、初甲苯、初二甲苯、溶剂油等液体燃料；并利用废酸废碱液等，提出酚类化合物、润滑脂等十二种新产品。不久前他们又利用炼焦窑排除的焦水、废电池的锌皮、锰粉、电池铜帽和石灰，试制出化肥和化工、医药原料等五十二种产品。
