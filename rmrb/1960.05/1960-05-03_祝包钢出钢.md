Congratulations on Baogang's Steel Production

Baotou Iron and Steel Company, our country's third large-scale modern iron and steel base, has completed its first large open-hearth furnace a year ahead of schedule and produced steel before May Day. This open-hearth furnace is comparable in scale to the "Open-Hearth Furnace King" of Anshan Iron and Steel and Wuhan Iron and Steel, and it is one of the largest automated open-hearth furnaces that has been put into production in our country. The steel production of Baogang's No. 1 open-hearth furnace means that our country's iron and steel front has added a strong new force. The construction of the Baotou Iron and Steel Industrial Base will accelerate on the basis of both iron and steel production. Baotou Iron and Steel Company is the first large-scale modern metallurgical enterprise built in our country in a minority area. Baogang's ability to rise from the ground in a short period of time, producing both iron and steel, is a new victory for the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong's ethnic policies.

Baotou Iron and Steel Company and Wuhan Iron and Steel Company are the two largest iron and steel joint enterprises that our country is currently vigorously constructing with the assistance of the Soviet Union. Wuhan Iron and Steel started construction earlier and is an advanced unit in the construction of large-scale metallurgical enterprises. Under the leadership of the Party, the support of the people of the whole country, and the help of Soviet experts, the workers of Baotou Iron and Steel Company are determined to learn from Wuhan Iron and Steel, catch up with Wuhan Iron and Steel, and surpass Wuhan Iron and Steel. They tenaciously overcame the severe cold of minus twenty degrees Celsius and built a large-scale open-hearth furnace with complex technology and fifteen large auxiliary workshops in only five months and five days. They didn't just pour steel a few days or weeks ahead of schedule, but a whole year early, and the quality of the project was excellent. The construction speed of many major individual projects has broken the construction records of Wuhan Iron and Steel. This is truly a case of you chasing me and one surpassing the other. The construction of Wuhan Iron and Steel and Baogang is so fast and so good, which most eloquently shows that, under the brilliant light of the General Line and under the ideological guidance of putting politics in command and launching mass movements in a big way, the Chinese people can not only achieve high speed in building small and medium-sized enterprises with relatively small scale and relatively simple technology, but also can fully achieve high speed in building large-scale enterprises with relatively large scale and relatively complex technology. This kind of high speed is something that capitalist countries could not even dream of, no matter which aspect you look at.

The fact that Baogang's large open-hearth furnace and fifteen huge auxiliary workshops were completed a year ahead of schedule shows that to achieve the high speed of the Great Leap Forward in the construction of large-scale enterprises, just like the construction of small and medium-sized enterprises, the central issue is to have the great ambition of Marxism-Leninism, dare to mobilize the masses to implement technological innovation and technological revolution on the correct, scientific, and nationwide track, dare to abandon outdated old conventions, and create new construction conventions according to the needs of the actual situation. The people who built Baogang were not intimidated by the "bigness" and "foreignness" of modern large-scale enterprises. In the technological innovation and technological revolution movement, they carried forward the communist style and the spirit of daring to think and act. They widely adopted advanced installation methods such as overall grouping (comprehensive cross-parallel operation) and overall assembly to replace the old installation methods, which enabled installation tasks that used to take dozens of days to complete to be completed in a few days. In the chimney project, they creatively applied new technologies such as changing electrode configuration, rapid heating, live operation, and multi-layer operation, creating the miracle of building a 100-meter-high chimney in just over nine days in the severe cold of minus twenty degrees Celsius. The open-hearth furnace was completed, but the ingot mold workshop was not yet completed. According to the conventional practice, they would have to close the furnace and wait. However, they exceptionally used the cold ingot depot for demolding. The magnetic raw material yard project was not completed, so they used the scrap steel processing yard instead. As a result, they gained time and speed.

The ambition of the workers of Baotou Iron and Steel Company is also reflected in their vigorous efforts to overcome difficulties, not acting as beggars, and resolutely implementing the Party Central Committee's directive to engage in diversified operations and self-reliance in a big way. Some people think that large enterprises like Baogang, because of the heavy construction tasks, can only rely on national support. If they simultaneously engage in diversified operations and implement self-reliance as much as possible, it will disperse their strength, hinder the progress of the project, and lose sight of the big picture for the sake of small gains, which is not cost-effective. This view has been proven wrong by facts. It is true that the construction of large enterprises like Baogang requires national support, and it is not possible to rely solely on the strength of one enterprise or even one region. However, this does not mean that one cannot be self-reliant in many aspects and implement diversified operations. The larger the "family" and the "business," the greater the potential for financial, material, and human resources, and the more conducive it is to self-reliance and the implementation of diversified operations. The practice of Baotou Iron and Steel Company is the most powerful proof. Since the beginning of last year, the machinery repair and manufacturing plant they have established has produced more than 1,000 sets of various machine tools and tools, and more than 1,000 electric motors. Last year, about 40% of all non-standard equipment installed by Baogang was manufactured by itself. The wet-ground slag concrete produced by their self-run cement plant can meet more than two-thirds of the needs of engineering construction. The comprehensive utilization wood factory they established used sawdust and waste materials from the construction site to make a large number of building materials such as shavings and wood chips, and used local hemp stalks and sorghum stalks to make templates to replace wooden templates, saving a lot of wood. The small steel pilot plant they established played a significant role in supplementing the shortage of steel during construction. In the near future, Baogang's need for small steel can also be self-sufficient. Self-reliance and engaging in diversified operations in a big way not only did not hinder the progress of the project, but also greatly accelerated the speed of construction and saved construction funds and transportation capacity for the country. This is an important guideline for implementing the General Line in industrial construction and a powerful guarantee for achieving high speed.

Baogang is for the whole country, and the whole country is for Baogang. The Baotou Iron and Steel Industrial Base, which is vigorously supported by many parts of the country, is growing at a high speed and is beginning to play an active role in supporting the whole country. However, it will take several more years of effort to fully complete this huge new steel base. The people of all ethnic groups in our country should continue to implement the central policy of simultaneously developing central industry and local industry, large enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises. While running steel "small foreign groups" and "small indigenous groups" in a big way, they should continue to vigorously support the construction of modern large-scale enterprises such as Baogang. All builders of Baogang should, under the leadership of the Party, hold the banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, exert even greater effort, continue to carry forward the spirit of daring to think and act, and make greater contributions to accelerating the completion of the Baotou Industrial Base.

    祝包钢出钢
    我国第三个大型的现代钢铁基地——包头钢铁公司第一座大平炉，已经提前一年建成并在五一前夕出钢了。这座平炉和鞍钢、武钢的“平炉之王”规模相当，是我国已经投入生产的自动化操作的最大平炉之一。包钢一号平炉出钢，我国钢铁战线上从此又增加了一支强大的生力军，包头钢铁工业基地的建设将在出铁又出钢的基础上加快步伐前进。包头钢铁公司是我国在少数民族地区兴建的第一个现代化大型冶金企业。包钢能够在短短的时间内平地起家，出铁又出钢，这是党中央和毛泽东同志民族政策的新胜利。
    包头钢铁公司和武汉钢铁公司，是我国在苏联的援助下，目前正在大力兴建的两个最大的钢铁联合企业。武钢的建设开始得早一些，是大型冶金企业建设中的一个先进单位，包头钢铁公司职工在党的领导、全国人民的支援以及苏联专家的帮助下，立志学武钢、赶武钢、超武钢。他们顽强地战胜了零下二十度的严寒，只用五个月零五天的时间，就建成了一座技术复杂的大型平炉和十五个大型的辅助车间，不是提前几天、几个星期，而是提前一年流出钢水，而且工程质量都是优等的。许多重大的单项工程的建设速度，都刷新了武钢的建设纪录。这真是你追我赶，一个赛过一个。武钢和包钢的建设这样快，这样好，最雄辩地说明了，在总路线的光芒照耀下，在政治挂帅和大搞群众运动的思想指导下，我国人民不但在建设规模比较小的、技术比较简单的中小型企业中能够实现高速度，而且在建设规模比较大、技术比较复杂的大型企业中，也完全能够实现高速度。这种高速度，无论就哪一方面来说，都是资本主义国家连做梦也想不到的。
    包钢这座大型平炉和十五个巨大的辅助车间提前一年建成的事实表明，建设大型企业跟建设中小型企业一样，要实现大跃进的高速度，中心的问题是要有马克思列宁主义的雄心大志，敢于发动群众在正确的、科学的、全民的轨道上实行技术革新和技术革命，敢于抛弃过时了的旧常规，按照实际情况的需要，创造新的建设常规。建设包钢的人们，没有被现代大型企业的“大”和“洋”所吓倒。他们在技术革新、技术革命运动中，发扬了共产主义的风格和敢想敢干的精神。他们广泛采用了总体组立（综合交叉平行作业）、总体拼装的先进安装方法代替旧的安装方法，使过去需要几十天才能完成的安装任务在几天之内完成了。他们在烟囱工程上创造性地运用了改变电极配置、快速升温、带电操作和多层作业等新技术，创造了在零下二十度的严寒下，用九天多一点的时间建成一座百米高的烟囱的奇迹。平炉建成了，钢锭模车间还没建成，按照常规只好闭上炉子等待，而他们却破格地利用了冷锭库进行脱模。磁性原料场工程还没完工，他们就拿废钢处理场来代替。结果赢得了时间，赢得了速度。
    包头钢铁公司的职工们的雄心大志，还表现在鼓足干劲，顽强地克服困难，不作伸手派，坚决贯彻执行党中央指示的大搞多种经营、自力更生的方针上面。有人以为，像包钢这样的大型企业，由于建设任务重，只能靠全国支援，如果同时大搞多种经营，尽可能地实行自力更生，那就会分散力量，妨碍工程的建设进度，因小失大，是不合算的。这种看法已经被事实证明是不对的。不错，像包钢这样的大型企业的建设，需要全国支援，只靠一个企业、甚至一个地区的力量是不行的。但是，这不等于不能在许多方面自力更生，实行多种经营。“家大业大”，企业越大，财力、物力、人力的潜力就越大，越有利于自力更生和实行多种经营。包头钢铁公司的实践就是最有力的证明。从去年年初以来，他们自办的机械修造厂共生产了各类机床、机具一千多件，电动机一千多台。去年包钢安装的全部非标准设备中，有40％左右是自己制造的。他们自办的水泥厂所生产的湿碾矿渣混凝土，可以满足工程建设需要的三分之二以上。他们自办的综合利用木材工厂，利用工地上的锯末、废料制成了大量的刨花板、木屑板等建筑材料，并利用当地的麻秆和高粱秸制成模板，代替木模板，节约了大量的木材。他们自办的小型钢铁试验厂，对于补充施工中钢材的不足起了很大的作用。不久的将来，包钢建设所需要的小型钢材，也可以自给。自力更生，大搞多种经营，不但没有妨碍工程的建设进度，而且大大加速了建设的速度，并为国家节约了建设资金，节约了运输力量。这是工业建设中贯彻执行总路线的一条重要方针，是实现高速度的有力保证。
    包钢为全国，全国为包钢。全国许多地方大力支援的包头钢铁工业基地，正在高速度地成长着，并且开始发挥支援全国的积极作用。但是，要把这个规模巨大的新钢铁基地全部建成，还需要再作几年的努力。我国各族人民应当继续执行中央工业与地方工业、大型企业与中小型企业同时并举的方针，在大办钢铁“小洋群”“小土群”的同时，继续大力支援包钢等现代大型企业的建设。包钢的全体建设者，应当在党的领导下，更高地举起毛泽东思想旗帜，鼓足更大的干劲，继续发扬敢想敢干的精神，为加速建成包头工业基地作出更大的贡献。
