Indonesian Prosecutors Make Things Difficult for Returning Overseas Chinese

Xinhua News Agency, May 30th, Jakarta News: After the lie of "the 'Da Baokang' ship leaving Indonesia without permission" was exposed, Indonesian prosecutors and others became enraged, further creating excuses in various places to make things difficult for Overseas Chinese and retaliate against them, obstructing their return to China.

According to reports, recently in Makassar, incidents occurred where personnel from the Prosecutor's Office forced Overseas Chinese preparing to return to China to go through various complicated procedures. They unreasonably limited Overseas Chinese to responding to their demands within 24 hours, otherwise they would not be able to return to China. After the Overseas Chinese were forced to agree to go through complicated procedures such as fingerprinting, the local prosecutor created new excuses, saying that the contents of the Overseas Chinese's luggage did not match the registration and "needed careful inspection," in order to delay the date of their return to China.

According to "Indonesian News" on the 24th, an Indonesian "senior official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs" said with ulterior motives that "some of the Overseas Chinese who recently returned to China transferred some of their property, such as gold and easily portable valuables, to their own country," and also said that "Selat Panjang has become a base for Overseas Chinese to transfer these things." He completely disregarded the fact that the 702 Overseas Chinese who returned to China on the "Da Baokang" on April 27th carried a total of only 360 pieces of luggage, averaging less than one piece of luggage per person. He also clamored that the Indonesian government "will take further measures to supervise the actions of returning Overseas Chinese." News said that Selat Panjang has already seen Overseas Chinese being forced to complete all return procedures in advance, and the relevant Indonesian authorities are attempting to complicate the procedures for Overseas Chinese returning to China to make things difficult and obstruct their return.

In Pekanbaru, Prosecutor-General Harahap has intensified his retaliation and persecution of Overseas Chinese. Ni Qingxiang, an Overseas Chinese who was brutally beaten by officials from the local Prosecutor's Office on May 7th, was unreasonably detained by the Prosecutor's Office on the 11th. He was subjected to abuse and insult by Harahap there. Harahap fiercely grabbed Ni Qingxiang's hair with one hand, pulling him back and forth, and used a military iron-clad belt to intimidate him while interrogating him. After failing to obtain any confession at all, he threw Ni Qingxiang into prison on the 14th, falsely accusing Ni Qingxiang of being a political prisoner and threatening to exile him.

This cruel and unreasonable Prosecutor-General Harahap of Pekanbaru, who has close ties with American oil companies, once ordered the hijacking of the "Da Baokang," which was carrying Overseas Chinese returning to China, threatened the returning Overseas Chinese with a knife, and detained a large number of returning Overseas Chinese's daily necessities. According to Indonesian news agencies, Indonesian Attorney General Gunawan praised Harahap at a West Java prosecutor's business meeting on May 21st, saying that he "adopted a firm position" and "adhered to the various instructions issued by his superiors." Gunawan also asked other prosecutors to emulate Harahap.

News from Banjarmasin said that the Banjarmasin Prosecutor's Office has recently required Overseas Chinese preparing to return to China to first complete a form from the Prosecutor's Office, requiring adults to fill out numerous forms and affix 72 fingerprints; then submit it to the "Committee for Handling the Return of Overseas Chinese" for review, and only after approval can they complete other departure procedures. This practice is more complicated than the usual procedures for Overseas Chinese returning to China.

### 印度尼西亚检察机关百般刁难归国华侨

    “大宝康号”事件的谎言被揭穿后恼羞成怒
    印度尼西亚检察机关百般刁难归国华侨
    望加锡检察署人员逼迫归国华侨办理各种复杂手续，经常节外生枝地制造新的借口，拖延华侨回国日期。
    北干巴鲁检察长竟凶殴并无理扣押华侨倪庆祥。
    新华社30日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚检察机关等在诬蔑“‘大宝康号’轮船未经允许逃离印度尼西亚”的谎言被揭穿后恼羞成怒，进一步在各地制造借口，对华侨百般刁难和打击报复，阻挠他们回国。
    据报道，最近在望加锡发生了检察署人员逼迫准备回国的华侨办理各种复杂的手续的事件。他们无理限定华侨在二十四小时内答复他们的要求，否则就不能回国。在华侨被迫同意办理盖指印等繁杂手续后，当地检察官又节外生枝制造新的借口，说华侨的行李内容和登记的不符，“需要仔细检查”，以拖延华侨回国的日期。
    据“印度尼西亚新闻”24日报道，印度尼西亚“外交部的一位高级官员”别有用心地说，最近回国的华侨中“有些人把他们的一部分财产如黄金和便于携带的贵重东西转移到他们自己的国家去”，还说，“石叻班让已成为华侨转移这些东西的基地”。他完全无视4月27日乘“大宝康号”轮回国的七百零二名华侨总共仅携带三百六十件行李，平均每人还不到一件行李的事实。他还叫嚷，印度尼西亚政府“将采取进一步的措施来监督回国华侨的行动”。有消息说，石叻班让已经发生逼迫华侨提前办理一切回国手续的事情，印度尼西亚有关当局企图使华侨回国手续更加复杂化来刁难阻挠华侨回国。
    在北干巴鲁，检察长哈拉哈变本加厉地对华侨进行报复和迫害。5月7日被当地检察署官员凶殴的华侨倪庆祥已在11日被检察署无理扣押。他在那里受到了哈拉哈的谩骂和侮辱。哈拉哈凶狠地一手抓住倪庆祥的头发拉来推去，一手拿着军用包铁皮带进行恐吓，并且加以审问。在根本问不出什么口供后，在14日把倪庆祥投入监狱，诬指倪庆祥是政治犯，并扬言要加以流放。
    这个凶残无理的、和美国石油公司来往密切的北干巴鲁检察长哈拉哈，曾经下令劫持过载运华侨回国的“大宝康号”，拔刀威胁归国华侨，扣留了大批归国华侨的日用衣物。据印度尼西亚的通讯社报道，印度尼西亚最高检察长古纳宛5月21日在西爪哇检察官业务会议上居然称赞哈拉哈“采取了坚定的立场”，“恪守了他的上级领导所发布的各种有关指示”。古纳宛还要其他检察官仿效哈拉哈。
    从马辰来的消息说，马辰检察机关近来要求准备回国的华侨先办理检察署的表格，要求成人先填无数表格和盖七十二个指印；然后再交“处理华侨回国委员会”审查，批准后才能办其他离境手续。这一做法比通常华侨回国的手续更加复杂了。
