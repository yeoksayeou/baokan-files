One Stove, Multiple Pots: Saving Coal and Labor, Cooking and Boiling Water, Simultaneously Smokes Fertilizer
    Linshui County Promotes the Kunshan Chimney All-Purpose Stove

    (Our report) A Kunshan chimney all-purpose stove, which has more and greater advantages than the "ox-tail stove," has been created in the canteens under the command of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Linshui County Committee. This stove was successfully researched, improved, and tested by Comrade Sheng Yongtang, the First Secretary of the CCP Linshui County Committee, when he went to the canteen to work as a cook and worked with the commune members.

    The Kunshan chimney all-purpose stove is a new type of coal-burning stove with multiple pots and a chimney lying horizontally upwards. It consists of a true furnace and multiple false furnaces (sloping shape) connected together. By using the force of the flames, each pot has sufficient firepower, making it easy to cook rice, prepare dishes, and boil water. At the same time, from the smoke throat of the last pot of the stove, a greenhouse and a fertilizer smoking stove are set up, fully utilizing the heat energy and coal smoke to serve agricultural production and the lives of the commune members. After the successful trial of this stove, the commune members called the fertilizer smoking kiln behind the stove a "fertilizer depot" that is "never extinguished for a thousand years, never stopped for ten thousand years," and called this stove a "treasure box" and an "all-purpose stove." Specifically, this stove has nine major advantages: First, it saves labor, speeds up cooking, and reduces the labor intensity of the cooks. For example, in a public canteen serving 300 people, the old stove required five people to carry coal every day, but now only two people are needed. At the same time, when cooking, one pot is used for rice, the second pot for dishes, and the third and fourth pots for boiling water. Each meal is cooked with one stove, reducing the time by more than half and greatly reducing the labor intensity of the cooks. Second, it saves fuel. The old stove burned more than 300 jin of coal every day, while the new stove only burns 100 to 160 jin of coal per day. Third, it is clean and hygienic. The new stove has no dust in front of the stove, no dust in the middle, and no coal smoke in the back. Fourth, it utilizes coal smoke to accumulate fertilizer, which is simply inexhaustible. One stove can smoke 600,000 jin of high-quality fertilizer per month (longer chimneys smoke even more). Fifth, the greenhouse installed with the residual heat of the flame can dry 20,000 jin of wet millet per day according to the existing scale; it can dry 15,000 to 20,000 jin of feed and sweet potato slices; at the same time, idle residual smoke can also be used to kill grain pests. Sixth, the greenhouse that absorbs residual heat is a good hotbed for various crops; under any low-temperature conditions, it can ensure the normal germination of crop seeds and advance the sowing and planting period. Seventh, it can be used to hatch chickens and ducks in the greenhouse, hatching 3,000 to 4,000 eggs each time. Eighth, it further improves the living conditions of the commune members. Whether in winter or summer, the commune members have boiling water to drink and hot water to use. Ninth, the bathroom and barbershop attached to the canteen can have hot water available regularly without having to start a fire.

    The Linshui County Committee has decided to first promote this all-purpose stove in Chengnan Commune. This commune has built 42 stoves in half a month. After the harvest of the spring crops, the stove will be widely promoted throughout the county. (Attached picture)

### 一灶多锅　省煤省工　做饭烧水　同时熏肥  邻水县推广困山烟囱万能灶

    一灶多锅　省煤省工　做饭烧水　同时熏肥
    邻水县推广困山烟囱万能灶
    本报讯　一种比牛尾灶有更多更大优越性的困山烟囱万能灶，已经在中共四川邻水县委指挥的食堂里诞生。这种灶是中共邻水县委第一书记盛永堂同志下食堂当炊事员，和社员们多次研究改进试验成功的。
    困山烟囱万能灶，是一种一灶多锅、烟囱横卧向上的新型烧煤灶。它由一个真炉膛和多个假炉膛（斜坡形）连接构成，借着火焰的冲力，使每口锅都有充足的火力，便于煮饭、作菜、烧水；同时，从灶的最后一锅烟喉处起，又设置了温室和熏肥灶，充分利用了火的热能和煤烟，为农业生产和社员们的生活服务。这种灶试验成功以后，社员们称灶后的熏肥窑是“千年不熄火、万年不停窑”的“肥库”，称这种灶是“百宝箱”、“万能灶”。具体说来，这种灶有九大好处：一、节省劳动力，加快煮饭速度，减轻炊事员的劳动强度。例如，一个三百人吃饭的公共食堂，原来用旧灶煮饭每天要五个人挑炭，现在两个人挑炭就行了；同时，煮饭时一锅煮饭，二锅作菜，三锅四锅烧水，每顿饭一灶熟，时间减少了一半多，炊事员的劳动强度大大减轻；二、节省燃料。旧灶每天烧煤三百多斤，新灶每天只烧煤一百斤到一百六十斤；三、又清洁，又卫生。新灶灶前无灰尘，中间无扬尘，后面无煤烟；四、利用煤烟熏积肥料，简直是取之不尽，用之不竭。一个灶每月可熏优质肥料六十万斤（烟囱长还熏得更多）；五、利用火焰余热装置的温室，按现有规模每天可炕湿谷子二万斤；炕饲料、苕片一万五千至两万斤；同时，也可以利用闲散余烟熏杀粮食虫害；六、吸收余热的温室，是各种作物良好的温床；在任何低温条件下，都可以保证作物种子正常发芽，提早播种、栽插期；七、利用温室孵鸡鸭，每次可孵卵三四千个；八、进一步改善了社员生活条件。无论冬天夏天，社员有开水喝、热水用；九、食堂附设的浴室和理发室，不需生火也能经常有热水用。
    邻水县委已决定先在城南公社推广这种万能灶，这个公社在半月内已建成四十二个灶。小春作物收割后，全县将普遍推广。（附图片）
