Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 3rd May: The workers of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's various rolling mills, after completing the April steel production plan three days ahead of schedule, continued to fight hard in the Red May campaign. From May 1st to 4pm on May 3rd, they overproduced by more than 1,000 tons of high-quality steel beyond the planned target. The average daily production level during these days increased by 16.7% compared to April.

In late April, the workers of various rolling mills made preparations for production, technology, and ideology in May, determined to make May's production exceed that of April. As soon as May arrived, a bustling joint technical performance competition, head-to-head competition, and cooperation competition immediately unfolded from the primary rolling mill to various section steel mills. The workers of the rolling plate mill launched challenge and response activities between shifts and teams. On May 1st, each shift overfulfilled the production plan, creating a new record since operations began. From the 1st to the first shift of the 3rd, the average daily production level increased by 30% compared to April, producing a batch of high-quality steel plates for the country. Zhao Zhongshan, a steel rolling expert at the First Medium Plate Mill, made full use of the advanced experience that emerged during the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, improved steel rolling methods, reduced the number of rolling passes, and accelerated the steel rolling speed. His advanced experience was quickly promoted in other shifts, and as a result, all shifts in the factory overfulfilled the plan. In the first two days alone, they overproduced 475 tons of high-quality steel plates. The Large Rolling Mill also overproduced for three consecutive days, increasing the production of high-quality steel rails by 418 tons. (Attached picture)

In order to generally improve production levels, Anshan Iron and Steel's various units promoted new technologies through mobile performance teams, new technology promotion groups, and advanced experience summary and promotion groups.

    鞍钢各轧钢厂纷传超产捷报
    新华社鞍山3日电　鞍山钢铁公司各轧钢厂的职工，在提前三天完成4月份钢材生产计划以后，继续大战红五月，从5月1日到3日十六时为止，又在完成计划以外，为国家增产了一千多吨优质钢材，这几天的平均日产水平比4月份提高16.7％。
    各轧钢厂职工在4月下旬就作好了5月份生产、技术和思想的准备工作，决心使5月份的生产超过4月。刚一跨进5月，从初轧厂到各型钢厂，立即掀起了热火朝天的联合技术表演赛、对手赛、协作赛。轧板厂的工人们展开了班与班组与组之间的挑战应战活动，5月1日每班都超额完成了生产计划，创造了开工以来的最高新纪录，从1日到3日第一班为止，平均日产水平比4月增加了30％，为国家增产了一批优质钢板。第一中板厂的轧钢能手赵忠山，充分运用技术革新、技术革命运动中出现的先进经验，改进轧钢方法，减少了轧制道次，加快了轧钢速度。他的先进经验很快在其他各班推广，结果全厂班班超额完成了计划，仅头两天就超产四百七十五吨优质钢板。大型轧钢厂也接连三天超产，共增产了优质钢轨四百一十八吨。（附图片）
