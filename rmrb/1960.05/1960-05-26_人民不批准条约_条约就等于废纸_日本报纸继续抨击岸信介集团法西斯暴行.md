Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 25th: Japanese newspapers continue to demand the resignation of Kishi Nobusuke and the dissolution of the Diet.

　　Today's "Tokyo Shimbun" published a commentary by its editorial board member, Motoji Tomishima, stating that Kishi Nobusuke should resign immediately and dissolve the Diet in order to hold new elections and listen to the people's opinions on the new "Security Treaty."

　　He said that it is both pathetic and laughable to see Kishi Nobusuke, surrounded by enemies on all sides, so reluctant to leave his position and desperately trying to continue as Prime Minister.

　　The political commentator also said that even if Kishi Nobusuke uses obvious violence to forcibly "approve" the new treaty, not a single Japanese person will approve this new treaty. "A treaty not approved by the people is nothing more than a piece of waste paper."

　　The local major newspaper, "Hokkaido Shimbun," also said in its May 22nd editorial that there is no other way to resolve the current political situation except to dissolve the Diet.

　　The newspaper pointed out that even if the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet resigns, even if those who have not dirtied their hands form another government, the new "Security Treaty" will "automatically take effect" if the Diet is not dissolved. It then emphasized that the most important thing now is to force the government to dissolve the Diet to prevent the new treaty from "automatically taking effect."

    人民不批准条约　条约就等于废纸
    日本报纸继续抨击岸信介集团法西斯暴行
    新华社25日讯　东京消息：日本报纸继续要求岸信介下台和解散国会。
    今天的“东京新闻”发表这个报社的社论委员长唐岛基智三的评论说，岸信介应当立即辞职，解散国会，以便举行新的选举，听取人民对新“安全条约”的意见。
    他说，看到四面楚歌的岸信介对他的职位非常留恋不舍，竭力想继续当首相，真是可怜又可笑。
    这个政治评论员又说，即便岸信介使用了明显的暴力强行“批准”新条约，但是没有一个日本人民会批准这个新条约。“人民不批准的条约，不过是一张废纸”。
    地方大报“北海道新闻”22日的社论也说，除了解散国会以外，没有别的办法能够解决目前的政治局势。
    这家报纸指出，即使岸信介内阁辞职，即使那些没有弄脏自己手的人另组政府，但是如果不解散国会的话，新“安全条约”也将“自动生效”。接着，它强调说，现在最重要的事情，是迫使政府解散国会，来阻止新条约“自动生效”。
