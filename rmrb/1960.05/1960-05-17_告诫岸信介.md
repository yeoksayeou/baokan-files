    Admonition to Kishi Nobusuke
    Mr. Kishi Nobusuke, I wonder what you think of the South Korean people's anti-"government" movement this time? It seems that the authorities have issued martial law and used the power of the army to suppress it somehow; but doesn't the principle of equal pressure and counter-pressure also apply to human society? You are now trying to forcibly approve the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" in the Diet, and you must not see the South Korean incident as someone else's problem.
    You explain that "the new Security Treaty is defensive." Even if it is "defensive" in policy, it is offensive in military terms, especially in strategy and tactics, which you are well aware of. You also said, "Because there is a guarantee of prior consultation, U.S. troops stationed in Japan will not take operational actions that violate the intentions of the Japanese government." However, in the past, the Japanese government could not even restrain the arbitrary actions of its own troops. You haven't forgotten these facts, have you? Since the Japanese government has no command or control over the U.S. military, how can the actions of the U.S. military be restrained? Furthermore, in today's age of advanced rockets, in terms of the nature of war, it is unimaginable that there would be a leisurely situation of prior consultation.
    Mr. Kishi Nobusuke, as you know, I am a person who has been engaged in national defense work for a long time. However, I am fully confident that in today's age of advanced offensive weapons, national defense cannot be guaranteed by military force. In order to truly guarantee national defense, the first and foremost point is not to make enemies. From past experiences and reflections, I have realized that: "True victory does not lie in defeating the opponent with force, but in treating each other with virtue and being friends with each other."
    Shortly after the end of the war, I once quoted the ancient saying "He who conquers others with virtue prospers, he who conquers others with force perishes" and made a statement to the effect that "Japan's disarmament is something to be blessed for the future of Japan and the world." Newspapers across the country published this statement, you must still remember it. When I was living with you in Sugamo Prison (war criminal prison), seeing what Bei Xin'er said, "Those who live by the sword die by the sword," further strengthened my above belief.
    A few years ago, I met you before I set off to visit China. At that time, what I said about the need to enhance friendly relations between Japan and China was also for the sake of Japan's future. Although it is not bad to be on good terms with the United States, it is absolutely impossible to protect Japan's national defense by making enemies of China and the Soviet Union.

    告诫岸信介
    日本埼玉县旧军人　远藤三郎（六十七岁）
    岸信介先生，不知你对这次南朝鲜人民的反“政府”运动作何看法？看来，当局发布戒严令，使用军队的力量好歹算是镇压住了；但是压力和反压力相等的物理原则，不也是适用于人间社会吗？你现在正企图在国会强行批准新日美“安全条约”，决不可把南朝鲜的事件看成他人瓦上霜。
    你解释说，“新安全条约是防卫性的”。即使在政策上是“防卫的”，但是在军事上，特别是战略战术上是进攻的，这一点你是清楚的。你还说：“因为有事先协商的保证，驻日美军不会采取违反日本政府意图的作战行动。”但是，过去日本政府连本国军队的独断专行都约束不了。这些事实你还没有忘记吧。既然日本政府对美国军队没有指挥权和管理权，美军的行动怎能够牵制得了呢？再说，在火箭发达的今天，从战争的性质来说，可以想像决不会有事先协商那种悠然自得的情况。
    岸信介先生，正如你所知道的，我是一个曾经长期从事国防工作的人。但是，我完全有把握说，在进攻武器发达的今天，国防是不能靠武力保障的。为了真正地保障国防，首要的一点就是不树敌。我从过去的体验和反省中觉悟到：“真正的胜利，不是用强力把对方打垮，而在于以德相处，同对方为友。”
    在战争刚结束后不久，我曾经引用“以德胜人者荣，以力胜人者亡”的古语，发表谈话，大意说：“日本解除武装，是应该为日本和世界的将来祝福的事情”。全国的报纸发表了这次谈话，你总还记得吧。和你一起住巢鸭监狱（战犯监狱）时，看到贝信尔所说“以剑兴者亡于剑”的话，就越发坚定了我上述的信念。
    几年前，我在动身去中国访问之前曾经见过你，那时我所说有必要增进日中友好关系的话，也是为日本的将来着想的。虽然同美国交好也不坏，但是以中苏为敌，就绝对保不住日本的国防。　（摘译自4月25日“朝日新闻”）
