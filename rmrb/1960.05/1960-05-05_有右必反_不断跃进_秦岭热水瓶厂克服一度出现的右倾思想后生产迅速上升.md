(Our newspaper, Xi'an, 4th dispatch) The Qinling Thermos Factory in Xi'an City, upholding the spirit of opposing rightism, criticized and overcame new right-leaning thoughts that emerged after technological innovation. Leading cadres rushed to the front lines of production, focusing on daily plans and weak links in production, and quickly reversed the downward trend in production that occurred in the first half of April. On April 23rd, they set a new record since the establishment of the factory by producing 6,200 thermos bottles in a single day. The daily production level has now stabilized at around 5,100, which is about 10% higher than the original plan of 4,600 thermos bottles per day.

From October of last year to the first quarter of this year, this factory continuously carried out a technological innovation and technological revolution movement centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, and continuous production, and achieved great results. They successively imitated and created more than 20 types of indigenous and foreign equipment such as bottle blowing machines, sealing machines, silvering machines, rapid thermal change testing machines, and semi-automatic bottle setting machines, which initially realized mechanization, semi-mechanization, and gasification of the main production processes, doubling the production capacity. However, the leaders of this factory were satisfied with the existing achievements and neglected the weak links that still existed in the production process, becoming blindly optimistic. They thought that with successful technological innovation, production was guaranteed to increase. Therefore, after making general arrangements for the production plan, they lacked inspection, and leading cadres did not go to the workshops as often as before. When problems arose in production, they could not be studied and solved in a timely manner, which hindered the entire production. For example, the glass kiln in Workshop No. 1 had an abnormal furnace temperature that fluctuated greatly, which greatly affected production. Workshop cadres reported that this was caused by poor coal quality and that the problem was difficult to solve. Some workers disagreed with this view, saying: If the coal quality is poor, why is the furnace temperature sometimes high and sometimes low? We should find the cause. In principle, since it is a key issue and there are different opinions, the leadership should go deep into the workshop, organize the masses to get to the bottom of the problem, prescribe the right medicine, overcome difficulties, and ensure the continuous leap forward in production. However, because they had a complacent and relaxed attitude, they did not do so, only instructing the workshop cadres to "find a way to solve" the problem. The workshop cadres still attributed the problem to objective conditions – poor coal quality – so the problem could not be solved. Because of the impact of these weak links, production declined in April, which directly affected the workers' morale, and even the labor competition could not be carried out. As a result, with sufficient raw materials, only 31% of the monthly plan was completed in the first half of April, and the daily production level dropped from more than 4,000 to more than 2,000.

This situation aroused the attention of the Xi'an Municipal Party Committee and the factory's superior leadership, who immediately sounded the alarm and asked them to examine and criticize the new right-leaning thoughts that emerged after technological innovation, and quickly reverse the production situation. After receiving instructions from the higher authorities, the factory's Party branch held an emergency general branch enlarged meeting that evening, deeply examined the right-leaning thought of being satisfied with the status quo. Through the examination, everyone clearly realized that although the achievements of technological innovation were great, it did not mean that all problems in production had been solved. On the contrary, as long as there is a weak link, it will affect the overall situation and hinder the smooth progress of production. Then, the factory director made a self-criticism at the workers' mobilization meeting, and leaders at all levels also carried out self-criticism. On the basis of improving ideological understanding, it was immediately decided to transfer 90% of the cadres, divided into day and night shifts, led by the secretary and the factory director respectively, to go deep into the workshops, work sections, and groups to participate in production and lead production. After the leading cadres went deep into the workshops, they immediately concentrated their efforts to organize shock teams to attack weak links. They implemented "two deployments and two inspections" for production, that is, deployment in the morning for the day shift and inspection at noon; deployment in the evening for the night shift and inspection at twelve o'clock. Problems were reported and studied and solved at any time. At the same time, the key problems in production were classified and lined up, handed over to the masses, and organized for discussion and suggestions. The general branch secretary, factory director, chairman of the trade union, and secretary of the Communist Youth League divided up the responsibilities, each taking charge of a key area and making breakthroughs.

Because the leading cadres went to the front lines of production and grasped the problems specifically and studied them carefully, many key production problems were quickly solved. For example, the abnormal furnace temperature in Workshop No. 1, which had the greatest impact on production, was found by the factory director and the production section chief, who conducted detailed observations while working with the workers, to be caused by the amount of coal added being sometimes too much and sometimes too little, the interval between coal additions being sometimes too long and sometimes too short, and the improper matching of good and bad coal. Based on the record data obtained from observation and the practical experience of the workers, they formulated operating procedures for adding coal and a ratio for matching good and bad coal, which solved the problem that some people had previously considered difficult to solve. With the furnace temperature normalized, the daily output of blanks rose sharply, producing more than 5,000 sets on April 18th and more than 9,000 sets on the 20th. Another problem that affected the factory's overall output, the lack of ovens, was also solved with the personal participation of the secretary in the research, finding a set of solutions such as adding coal on time, increasing the combustion temperature of coal gas, and appropriately shortening the bottle baking time.

The practical actions of leading cadres going deep into the front lines of production and solving problems specifically greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the workers, and the labor competition of catching up with each other immediately appeared in a new climax. With the efforts of all the factory's employees, the output of finished products increased step by step.

    有右必反　不断跃进
    秦岭热水瓶厂克服一度出现的右倾思想后生产迅速上升
    本报西安4日电　西安市秦岭热水瓶制造厂坚持有右必反的精神，批判和克服了革新技术后出现的新的右倾思想，领导干部齐奔生产第一线，狠抓日计划和生产薄弱环节，迅速扭转了4月上半月生产一度下降的趋势，生产迅速上升。4月23日创造了日产热水瓶六千二百个的建厂以来的新纪录。现在日产水平已稳定在五千一百个上下，比原订日产四千六百个热水瓶的计划高出10％左右。
    这个厂从去年10月份起到今年一季度连续开展了以机械化、半机械化、生产连续化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，取得了很大成绩。他们先后仿制和创制成功了吹瓶机、封口机、镀银机、耐热急变检验机、半自动套瓶机等二十多种土洋设备，使主要生产工艺过程初步实现了机械化、半机械化和煤气化，生产能力提高了一倍多。可是，这个厂的领导人员满足了已有的成果，忽略了生产过程中仍然存在的薄弱环节，而盲目乐观起来。他们满以为：技术革新搞得好，生产保险能上去。因此，生产计划作了一般布置以后，缺乏检查，领导干部也不像以前那样经常下车间了。生产中出现了问题，不能及时研究解决，使整个生产受到了拖累。例如一车间的玻璃窑，炉温忽高忽低，很不正常，影响生产很大。车间干部反映说，是煤质不好造成的，问题难解决。有些工人不同意这个看法，他们说：既然是煤质不好，为什么炉温有时高，有时低？应该好好找找原因。按理说，既是关键问题，又有不同看法，领导方面就应该深入车间组织群众追根究底，对症下药，克服困难，保证生产持续跃进。可是，由于他们存在着自满松劲情绪，便没有这样做，只有责成车间干部去“设法解决”。而车间干部仍然把问题归咎于客观条件——煤质不好，所以问题得不到解决，正因为受这些薄弱环节的影响，进入4月份后，生产日趋下降，这也直接影响了工人的情绪，连劳动竞赛也搞不起来了。结果在原材料充足的情况下，4月上半月仅完成月计划的31％，日产水平由四千多个下降到二千多个。
    这种情况，引起了中共西安市委和这个厂的上级领导部门的重视，立即向他们敲起了警钟，要求他们检查批判在革新技术后出现的新的右倾思想，迅速扭转生产局面。这个厂的党总支在接到上级指示后，当晚召开了紧急总支扩大会议，深入检查了满足现状的右倾思想，通过检查使大家明确认识到：虽然技术革新成果很大，但不等于生产上一切问题都解决了。相反地只要有一个薄弱环节存在，就会牵动全局，影响生产顺利进展。接着，厂长在职工动员大会上作了自我检查，各级领导也层层开展了自我批评。在思想认识提高的基础上，当即决定抽调90％的干部，分成日夜两班，由书记、厂长分别率领深入车间、工段、小组，参加生产，领导生产。领导干部深入车间以后，马上集中力量组织突击队，猛攻薄弱环节。对生产实行“两布置两检查”，即白班早晨布置，中午检查；夜班晚上布置，十二点检查，有了问题随时汇报，随时研究解决。同时，还把生产中的关键问题分类排队，交给群众，组织讨论，献计献策；又由总支书记、厂长、工会主席、团委书记分工把口、突破重点。
    由于领导干部奔向生产前线，问题抓得具体，研究得细致，很多生产关键问题都迅速获得解决。如一车间影响生产最大的炉温不正常问题，经厂长和生产股长在同工人一起劳动中进行了详细的观察，发现炉温忽高忽低的根本原因是，加煤量忽多忽少，加煤间隔时间忽长忽短，好坏煤搭配不当。他们根据观察得来的纪录资料和工人的实践经验，制定了加煤的操作规程和好坏煤搭配比例，结果就使这个原来一些人认为很难解决的问题迎刃而解。炉温正常了，料坯日产量直线上升，4月18日产五千多套，20日便生产出九千多套。另一个影响全厂产量的烘箱不足的问题，也在书记亲自参与研究下，找到了按时加煤、提高煤气燃烧温度、适当缩短瓶子烘烤时间等一套解决办法。
    领导干部深入生产第一线，具体解决问题的实际行动，大大鼓舞了工人群众的干劲，你追我赶的劳动竞赛马上又出现了新的高潮。在全厂职工努力下，成品产量步步上升。
