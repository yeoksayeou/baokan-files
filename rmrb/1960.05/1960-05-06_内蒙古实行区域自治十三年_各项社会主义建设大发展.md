    Thirteen Years of Regional Autonomy in Inner Mongolia:
    Great Development in Various Socialist Constructions
  Industrial Production Increases More Than 32 Times
  Grain Output Increases by 7.5 Billion Jin
  Livestock Production Ranks First in the Country
    (Our Dispatch) With great development in various socialist constructions after thirteen years of implementing ethnic regional autonomy, Inner Mongolia has entered a new stage of socialist construction.
    The more than ten million people of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, holding high the banner of Mao Zedong, are steadfastly implementing the Party's General Line and the policy of ethnic regional autonomy. On the road of socialist construction, they are striving to build the Autonomous Region into a modern iron and steel, agriculture, animal husbandry, and forestry base of the motherland as quickly as possible, and are bravely advancing to catch up with the level of advanced fraternal nationalities.
    Since its establishment on May 1, 1947, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has undergone tremendous changes after thirteen years of socialist construction. The formerly backward and desolate Inner Mongolia has been replaced by iron and steel, agriculture, animal husbandry, and forestry, which are initially taking shape with modernization. Currently, with the Baotou iron and steel industrial base as the center, 1,884 new large, medium, and small blast furnaces and various types of large and small factories and mines for non-ferrous metals, chemicals, and other industries have been established throughout the region (excluding handicrafts and commune industries). In particular, after the continuous Great Leap Forward of 1958 and 1959, by the end of last year, the total industrial output value of the region had increased from 9.4% of the total value of industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry in the early days of liberation to 48%. The proportion of heavy industry output value in the total industrial output value also rose from 18.4% to over 63%. In the past two years, the region also produced more than 330,000 tons of iron, more than 80,000 tons of steel, and more than 10,000 tons of steel products.
    With the great development of the metallurgical industry, a fairly large-scale machinery manufacturing and repair network has emerged in the autonomous region's metal processing industry. The formation of the machinery manufacturing and repair network has not only changed the situation before liberation, where even simple tools such as iron shovels, hoes, and sickles had to be supplied from other places, but it can also produce hundreds of large and precise products such as 80-cubic-meter blast furnaces, 6-ton converters, 500/300 rolling mills, generators, 32,000-ton cement equipment, 300,000-ton coal washing equipment, 100,000-ton coking equipment, and daily processing of 50-ton copper mining and beneficiation equipment. Some high, large, sophisticated, and cutting-edge new products have also been successfully trial-produced, making the proportion of the autonomous region's metal processing industry in the entire industry rise from 4.1% in 1952 to 19.8% last year, laying the foundation for the mechanization and semi-mechanization of agricultural and animal husbandry production in the future. The production of coal, transportation, postal and telecommunications, and light industry has also increased several times due to the impetus of the iron and steel and machinery industries. By 1959, the proportion of the total industrial output value of the region increased by 32.8 times compared with 1947. Inner Mongolia is an agricultural product base of the motherland, with boundless fertile farmland. However, when the Autonomous Region was established in 1947, it only produced more than 3.5 billion jin of grain. Last year, grain output reached 11 billion jin, with an average of more than 1,030 jin of grain per person in the region. Thirteen years ago, the Autonomous Region had only more than 8.28 million head of livestock of various kinds, and now it has increased to more than 28 million head, ranking first in the country. More than half of the nomadic herdsmen who have lived by moving with water and grass for thousands of years have now settled down. The single pastoral economy on the grasslands has become a socialist diversified economy with animal husbandry as the main focus and combining agriculture and animal husbandry. The Autonomous Region's forestry industry has also developed by leaps and bounds, shifting from seasonal production in the past to year-round operations. In 1959, the year-round operation coefficient increased to 36.4%. The total output of logs in the region has reached 3.73 million cubic meters, an increase of 56.4 times compared with the 60,000 cubic meters of wood produced in the entire region in 1947.
    The great development of industrial, agricultural, and animal husbandry production has rapidly changed the cultural landscape of the Autonomous Region. A relatively complete education system, including pre-school education to higher education, has been formed. The total number of students in large, middle, and primary schools in the region has reached more than 1.51 million, an increase of 5.8 times compared with the time of the Autonomous Region's establishment. Inner Mongolia, which had never had a university in history, has now developed to 18 universities, with 8,250 students of various ethnic groups enrolled. In recent years, these institutions of higher learning have trained more than 2,000 construction talents for the Autonomous Region. The number of various types of secondary schools has also increased from 29 in 1947 to 449, and primary education has been basically universalized throughout the region. Health services are also thriving. In the thirteen years, the Mongolian population has increased by more than 340,000, and minority ethnic groups such as the Daur, Ewenki, and Oroqen have also achieved "longevity and abundance," completely changing the tragic situation of continuous population decline in history.
    In the socialist construction that is changing the backward face of the Autonomous Region, the state allocates huge amounts of funds and manpower every year to invest in large-scale construction in the Autonomous Region. The more than ten million people of all ethnic groups in the region use their hard-earned labor results every year to support the socialist economic construction of the motherland. In the thirteen years, they have transferred 15.78 million cubic meters of timber, more than 11.2 billion jin of grain, and more than 7.58 million head of livestock, becoming an important base for timber, grain, and livestock products of the motherland.

    内蒙古实行区域自治十三年
    各项社会主义建设大发展
  工业生产增长三十二倍多
  粮食产量增长七十五亿斤
  牧业生产跃居全国第一位
    本报讯　实行民族区域自治十三年各项社会主义建设大发展，内蒙古跨入社会主义建设新阶段。
    内蒙古自治区一千余万各族人民，正高举着毛泽东的旗帜，坚定不移地贯彻执行着党的总路线和民族区域自治政策，在社会主义建设道路上，要把自治区尽快建设成为祖国的现代化的钢铁、农业、畜牧业和林业的基地，为迅速赶上先进兄弟民族的水平而奋勇前进。
    内蒙古自治区从1947年5月1日成立到现在，经过十三年的社会主义建设，已经发生了巨大的变化。昔日落后荒凉的内蒙古，已被初具现代化雏型的钢铁、农业、畜牧业和林业所代替。现在全区以包头钢铁工业基地为中心，新建立起了大中小型高炉和有色金属、化学等各类大小厂矿一千八百八十四座（不包括手工业和公社工业）。特别是经过1958年和1959年的连续大跃进，到去年底，全区工业总产值，由解放初期占工农牧业总产值的9.4％，增长到了48％，重工业产值占工业总产值的比重，也由18.4％上升到63％以上。两年中，全区还生产了三十三万多吨铁，八万多吨钢，和一万多吨钢材。
    随着冶金工业的大发展，自治区的金属加工工业出现了一个相当规模的机械制造修配网。机械制造修配网的形成，不仅改变了解放前连铁锹、镐头和镰刀等简单工具都要靠外地供应的局面，而且自己能够生产八十立方米高炉、六吨重的转炉、500／300轧钢机、发电机、三万二千吨水泥设备、三十万吨洗炭设备、年产十万吨焦化设备和日处理五十吨铜采选设备等几百种大型精密产品，并试制成功了一些高、大、精、尖的新产品，使自治区金属加工工业，在整个工业中的比重，由1952年的4.1％，至去年上升到19.8％，为今后农牧业生产机械化和半机械化奠定了基础。在煤炭、交通邮电和轻工业的生产上，由于在钢铁和机械工业的带动下，也得到了成倍的增长。到1959年全区工业总产值的比重比1947年增长了三十二点八倍。内蒙古是祖国的一个农产品基地，这里有一望无际的肥沃农田，但在1947年自治区成立时，还只产三十五亿多斤粮食。去年，粮食产量达到一百一十亿斤，全区每人平均达到一千零三十多斤粮食。十三年前自治区的各种牲畜只有八百二十八万多头，现在已经增长到二千八百多万头，跃居全国第一位。千百年来逐水草而居的游牧区牧民，现在一半以上实现了定居，草原上单一的牧业经济，已经变为以牧为主、农牧结合的社会主义多种经济。自治区的森林工业也得到了飞跃发展，由过去的季节性生产转向了常年作业，1959年常年作业系数提高到36.4％，全区原木产量已达到三百七十三万立米，比1947年全区生产六万多立米木材增长五十六点四倍。
    工农牧业生产的大发展，迅速改变了自治区的文化面貌。一个包括学前教育到高等教育较完整的教育体系已经形成，全区大中小学学生总人数已达到了一百五十一万多人，比自治区成立时增加了五点八倍。历史上从没有过一所大学的内蒙古，现在已发展到十八所，在校的各民族学生达到八千二百五十人。几年来，这些高等院校，已为自治区培养了两千多名各种建设人才。各类中等学校，也由1947年的二十九所发展到四百四十九所，全区已基本普及初等教育。卫生事业也是欣欣向荣，十三年间蒙古族人民增加了三十四万多人，达斡尔、鄂温克和鄂伦春等少数民族也都实现了“人寿年丰”，彻底改变了历史上人口连年下降的悲惨局面。
    在改变自治区落后面貌的社会主义建设中，国家每年都拨出巨额的资金和人力，投入自治区的大规模建设。全区一千多万各族人民，每年用他们的辛勤的劳动果实，支持祖国社会主义经济建设，十三年间，就调拨了一千五百七十八万立米木材，一百一十二亿多斤粮食和七百五十八万多头牲畜，成了祖国木材、粮食和畜产品的一个重要基地。
