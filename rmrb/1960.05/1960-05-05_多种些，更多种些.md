Planting more is the first step in increasing crop yields. Planting more leads to greater harvests. This year, the planting area in most regions has been expanded compared to previous years. This is a great thing. Now, we should seize the opportunity and advance victoriously to plant even more.

Is it necessary to plant more? Absolutely. Our socialist construction is advancing rapidly. Industrial production is leaping forward in the movement of technical innovation and technical revolution, and agricultural production must increase grain and industrial raw materials at a higher speed. To make the speed of agricultural development adapt to the speed of industrial development and fully utilize the role of agriculture in the development of the national economy, it is necessary to accelerate the speed, strive to plant more while striving to increase yield per unit area, and not one-sidedly pursue high yield with less planting or extensive planting with low yield. Only by planting a lot, and striving for high yield on the basis of planting more, can the total output grow the most and the fastest. "Planting more" and "high yield" should be carried out simultaneously, which is the current policy for the high-speed development of agricultural production in our country. It is wrong to oppose "high yield" under the pretext of "planting more," or to oppose "planting more" under the pretext of "high yield." This is true for any crop. The planting area of any crop, such as grain, cotton, oil, hemp, tobacco, sugar, vegetables, etc., is always the more the better. For all kinds of crops, not only must the planting plan for this year be 100% completed, but also strive to over fulfill it.

Is it possible to plant more? Absolutely possible. Some people think that to plant more, one cannot achieve high yield, or that to achieve high yield, one cannot plant more, as if "planting more" and "high yield" are like "fish and bear's paw, one cannot have both." With the experience of the Great Leap Forward for the past two years and the consolidation and development of the people's communes, this view is obviously incorrect. The planting more we are advocating now is very different from the past's "extensive planting with low yield." In the past, "extensive planting with low yield" prevailed in some areas, which was a last resort. At that time, people were unable to universally improve unit yields, so they had to rely on "extensive planting" to hope for more harvests. The planting more we are advocating now is planting more while simultaneously pursuing high yield. The people's communes can organize manpower better, utilize land better, have newer agricultural tools, and have more advanced technologies, so they can take large-area, high-yield fields as the center and drive the general large fields forward together.

To plant more, what if there is not enough arable land? As long as the masses are mobilized to think of more ways, many arable lands can be found all over the country. For example, Laiyang County, Shandong Province, originally had more than 2.8 million mu of arable land; according to this year's national plan, in addition to planting enough food crops, it also needs to plant 740,000 mu of industrial raw material crops, an increase of 330,000 mu compared with last year; in addition, large-scale water conservancy construction, road construction, afforestation, etc. have also occupied more than 30,000 mu of land. From this point of view, the county's grain field area this year will be reduced by 365,000 mu compared with last year, and the increase in total grain output seems to have encountered difficulties. What to do? The county party committee led the communes, from inside the party to outside the party, from cadres to the masses, to summarize the experience of the Great Leap Forward, discuss the situation and tasks, and everyone encouraged hard work and offered suggestions; as a result, intercropping was adopted, and scattered vacant land such as the edges of houses, river banks, ditch ridges, and roadsides were used, and wasteland was reclaimed. These methods expanded the planting area by 600,000 mu, ensuring both the area of food crops and the area of industrial raw material crops. Another example is Suihua County, Heilongjiang, which has relatively little wasteland in Heilongjiang. However, they adopted several methods to expand the arable land area: reclaiming wasteland, using idle land and gaps, picking up abandoned land, closing unnecessary field roads, arching the head of the fields, and fully utilizing existing arable land. The county increased the planting area by more than 500,000 mu, accounting for more than one-tenth of the original arable land area. Another example is Liuyang County, Hunan Province, which originally had no wasteland. However, this spring, the masses were mobilized to carry out two rounds of utilizing the "ten edges" (field edges, slope edges, road edges, canal edges, river edges, mountain edges, pond edges, house edges, ditch edges, reservoir edges) "two tops" (low mountains, hills) "two flatlands" (soil drying flatlands, house yard flatlands), etc., to plant various crops on 53,000 mu, which is almost equal to 5% of the county's arable land area. These methods do not seem novel, but in the past, due to various restrictions on production conditions, it was impossible to promote them on a large scale; now, the strength of the people's communes is growing, and in terms of organization, technology, manpower, and material resources, there are favorable conditions for universally promoting these methods on a large scale. As long as we fully recognize the necessity of doing so and fully utilize the favorable subjective and objective conditions, we can expand the planting area. All places that do this are warmly supported by the broad masses. Therefore, the policy of simultaneously carrying out planting more and harvesting more and high yield and harvesting more represents the urgent desire and common requirements of the people.

Each region and each commune should check one by one to see how the spring planting plan for various crops has been completed. Those who have not completed the plan, or those who have completed the plan but can still plant more according to the conditions of land and labor, should continue to strive to plant more. Before spring planting and at the beginning of spring planting, it is of course necessary to advocate appropriate early planting; however, if some crops in some places have not been fully planted early due to various conditions, it is always better to plant them now than not to plant them or to plant less; and as long as management is strengthened, more can still be harvested. Some crops, such as sweet potatoes, buckwheat, and some other short-growing crops, can still be planted for several months in most areas. In many areas in the south, three or four seasons can be planted in a year. After the major spring plowing, there can be another minor spring plowing, after the first spring plowing, there can be a second spring plowing, after spring planting, there can be summer planting, summer planting can also be carried out many times, and then there is autumn planting and winter planting. Our country has very good natural conditions for expanding the multiple cropping area, plus fully giving play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the people, mastering the laws of nature, and it can be done in many areas to plant more and harvest more.

Planting more and harvesting more is a strategic measure for the high-speed development of agricultural production. Our slogan is: Plant more, plant even more!

### 多种些，更多种些

    多种些，更多种些
    多种，是增加农作物产量的第一道关。多种可以多收。今年大部分地区播种面积都比往年扩大。这是一件大好事。现在应该抓紧时机，乘胜前进，种得更多一些。
    需要不需要种得更多？十分需要。我国社会主义建设事业正在迅速跃进。工业生产正在技术革新和技术革命运动中飞跃前进，农业生产必须以更高的速度增产粮食和工业原料。要使农业发展的速度同工业发展的速度相适应，充分发挥农业在国民经济发展中的作用，就必须加快速度，在力争提高单位面积产量的同时力争多种，而不能片面地高产少种或者广种薄收。只有多多地种，在多种的基础上力争高产，总产量才可能最多最快地增长。“多种”和“高产”同时并举，这是当前我国高速度发展农业生产的方针。以“多种”为借口反对“高产”，以“高产”为借口反对“多种”，都是不对的。无论哪一种作物都是如此。粮、棉、油、麻、烟、糖、菜等等，任何一种作物的播种面积都是多多益善。各种作物，不但要保证今年播种计划百分之百地完成，还要力争超额完成。
    能不能种得更多？完全可能。有人认为要多种就不能高产，或者认为要高产就不能多种，似乎“多种”和“高产”是“鱼与熊掌，不可兼得”。在我们已经有了两年的大跃进的经验和人民公社已经巩固和发展的条件下，这种看法显然是不对的。我们现在提倡的多种，同过去的“广种薄收”大不相同。过去，在一些地区盛行“广种薄收”，那是不得已的事情。在那个时候，人们无力普遍提高单位产量，只好靠“广种”的办法，希图能有较多的收获。我们现在提倡的多种，是和高产同时并举的多种。人民公社能够把人力组织得更好，把土地利用得更好，有更新式的农具，有更进步的技术，因之能够做到以大面积高额丰产田为中心，带动一般大田一同前进。
    为了多种，耕地不够怎么办？只要发动群众多想办法，全国各地都能够找出许许多多的可耕地。例如山东莱阳县，原有二百八十多万亩耕地；根据今年的国家计划，除了种足粮食作物以外，还要种工业原料作物七十四万亩，比去年增加三十三万亩；此外，大搞水利建设、修路、造林等还占用了土地三万多亩。这样来看，这个县今年的粮田面积就要比去年减少三十六万五千亩，粮食总产量的增加似乎是发生了困难。怎么办？这个县的县委领导各公社，从党内到党外，从干部到群众，总结跃进经验，讨论形势任务，大家鼓干劲、献计谋；结果，采取间作，利用屋边、河岸、渠埂、路边等零星空闲土地，开垦荒地，采取这些办法，共扩大播种面积六十万亩，粮食作物的面积和工业原料作物的面积都有了可靠的保证。又如黑龙江绥化县在黑龙江是荒地比较少的县份。可是，他们在扩大耕地面积方面采取开荒、利用闲田隙地、拣撂荒地、封闭不必要的田间道路、拱地头和充分利用现有耕地的几项办法，全县增加播种面积五十多万亩，占原有耕地面积的十分之一以上。又如湖南浏阳县，本来已经没有什么荒地。可是，今春发动群众开展了两次利用“十边”（田边、坡边、路边、圳边、河边、山边、塘边、屋边、渠边、水库边）“两上”（矮山上、土丘上）“两坪”（土晒坪、屋场坪）等等，多种各种作物五万三千多亩，差不多等于全县耕地面积的5％。这些办法，看起来并不新奇，可是，在过去，受着生产条件的种种限制，不可能大规模地普遍推行；现在，人民公社的力量越来越大，从组织上、技术上、人力上、物力上来说，已经有了在广大范围内普遍推行这些办法的有利条件。只要充分认识这样做的必要性，充分运用主观客观的有利条件，就能够扩大播种面积。凡是这样做的地方，无不受到广大群众的热烈支持。因此，多种多收和高产多收同时并举的方针代表着人民的迫切愿望和共同要求。
    每个地区、每个公社都要逐块逐项，查一查各种作物的春播计划完成的情况究竟如何。还没有完成计划的，或者已经完成计划而按照土地和劳动力等条件还可以多种的，都要继续力争多种。在春播以前和春播之初，当然要提倡适当早种；可是，有的地方某些作物如果限于种种条件未能全部早种，现在再来种，总比不种、少种要好得多；而且只要加强管理，仍然可以多收。有些作物，像甘薯、荞麦和其他一些生长期较短的农作物，在大部分地区，都还有几个月的时间可以种。在南方有许多地区，一年三季、四季都可以播种。大春耕之后可以再来个小春耕，第一次春耕之后可以再来个第二次春耕，春播之后可以继之以夏播，夏播也可以多次进行，然后还有秋播、冬播。我国有扩大复种面积的很好的自然条件，再加上充分发挥人民群众的积极性和创造性，掌握自然规律，在很多地区都可以做到更多种一些，更多收一些。
    多种多收，这是高速度发展农业生产的战略性的措施。我们的口号是，多种些，更多种些！
