Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, May 5th: Baotou Iron and Steel Company solemnly held a celebration meeting this morning for early steel production. Ulanhu, Vice Premier of the State Council and First Secretary of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Party Committee, attended the meeting and cut the ribbon for Baotou Steel's steel production.

Attending the celebration meeting were Su Qianyi and Kui Bi, secretaries of the Inner Mongolia Party Committee and vice chairmen of the Autonomous Region, alternate secretary Quan Xingyuan, Liu Huaxiang, deputy commander of the Inner Mongolia Military Region, as well as the Party and government leaders of Baotou City and Baotou Steel. Industrial secretaries of the League (City) committees and League (City) heads of the Autonomous Region, as well as commanders of military sub-districts, were also invited to attend the meeting.

Also invited to attend the celebration meeting were all the Soviet experts, led by Kruklykov, who are assisting in the construction of Baotou Steel.

Before the celebration meeting began, at around 9:00 a.m., Ulanhu, amidst the warm welcome of Mongolian and Han steelworkers, arrived at the No. 1 open hearth furnace workshop of Baotou Steel and cut the ribbon for Baotou Steel's steel production. Amidst music and firecrackers, Alatanbagen, a Mongolian steelworker and furnace chief of the No. 1 open hearth furnace, and his partners successfully produced another furnace of molten steel. After the steel was produced, Ulanhu met with the steel plant workers and shook hands cordially with the Mongolian and Han steelworkers one by one.

On this day, Baotou Steel employees were beaming with joy, and red flags fluttered and drums and gongs resounded in the steelmaking area and Kundulun district streets. At the center of the celebration meeting rostrum set up in the Baotou Steel Stadium hung a huge portrait of Chairman Mao, with huge slogans on both sides reading "Hold High the Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought and Advance Courageously" and "Strive to Build the Baotou Iron and Steel Industrial Base at High Speed." More than 20,000 Baotou Steel employees gathered in front of the stage.

The celebration meeting began at 10:30 a.m. After Chen Shouchong, Secretary of the Baotou Steel Party Committee, delivered the opening remarks, Ulanhu spoke at the meeting.

He first, on behalf of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Committee, extended warm congratulations and respect to all Baotou Steel employees who have demonstrated a high degree of initiative and creativity in construction, to all units inside and outside the region that have supported the construction of Baotou Steel, and to the Soviet experts who have enthusiastically helped in the construction of Baotou Steel.

Ulanhu then said that the completion and commissioning of Baotou Steel's No. 1 open hearth furnace is another new victory achieved in the construction of the Autonomous Region under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, under the encouragement of the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, following the iron production of No. 1 blast furnace. It is one of the major achievements of continuing the Great Leap Forward in 1960 and carrying out in-depth technical innovation and technical revolution movements. The completion and commissioning of Baotou Steel's No. 1 open hearth furnace has greatly improved the steelmaking capacity and technical level of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. With the acceleration of Baotou Steel's construction, a large number of pig iron, steel ingots, and steel will be produced in the future to meet the needs of national and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's production and construction. It has greatly promoted the construction of the Baotou industrial base and plays an important role in changing the face of the Autonomous Region and enabling the economic and cultural development level of the Mongolian and other ethnic groups in the Autonomous Region to catch up with the advanced level of the country as soon as possible.

Ulanhu pointed out that the Baotou industrial base has already entered the stage of simultaneous basic construction and industrial production. Therefore, he requested Baotou Steel to continue to strengthen leadership, strive to complete the basic construction tasks of Baotou Steel ahead of schedule in a relatively short period of time, and ensure that all projects are completed and put into production as soon as possible in accordance with quality and quantity standards. At the same time, it must also do a good job in the current steel production, increase the utilization coefficient of blast furnaces and open hearth furnaces as soon as possible, increase steel production, improve steel quality, and reduce costs, so that Baotou Steel can play a greater role in socialist economic construction.

Ulanhu also emphasized that the Baotou industrial base has reached a certain scale. To give play to the role of the Baotou industrial base, while completing its own production tasks, it is necessary to vigorously support the various constructions of the Autonomous Region, support the newly built factories and mines, and support agricultural and pastoral production in terms of technical equipment, material strength, and technical management and management personnel.

Su Qianyi, Secretary of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Party Committee and First Secretary of the Baotou Municipal Party Committee, also spoke at the meeting. He called on Baotou Steel employees to advance victoriously and accelerate the construction of major engineering systems such as the No. 2 large blast furnace, the third large coke oven, the primary rolling, and the ore dressing and sintering. He also called on the steelmaking plant and the ironmaking plant to carry out great collaboration and competition, help each other, promote each other, and strive to complete the steel production task, and first strive to overfulfill the production task for the second quarter ahead of schedule.

Kruklykov, the acting leader of the Soviet experts who helped in the construction of Baotou Steel, spoke at the meeting. He praised the heroic labor of Baotou Steel employees and extended sincere congratulations to the builders of Baotou Steel.

Finally, Lu Likun, Secretary of the Baotou Steel Steelmaking Zone Working Committee, and Liu Yaozong, Secretary of the Party Committee and Director of the Steelmaking Plant, said in their speeches: resolutely respond to the call of the Party, guarantee the early completion of the production and construction tasks assigned by the state, achieve high output and high quality, and continue the Great Leap Forward.

At the celebration meeting, the person in charge of Baotou Steel read out letters of thanks to the Soviet experts and the provinces, cities, and brother factories and mines across the country that supported the construction of Baotou Steel.

On the evening of the 5th, Baotou Steel held a grand celebration banquet and evening party. (Attached picture)

    数万职工喜气洋洋欢呼高速度的胜利
    包钢举行提前出钢庆祝大会
    乌兰夫副总理到会祝贺，号召加快基本建设和提高钢铁产量质量
    据新华社包头5日电　包头钢铁公司于5日上午隆重举行了提前出钢庆祝大会。国务院副总理、中共内蒙古自治区委员会第一书记乌兰夫出席了大会，并为包钢出钢剪彩。
    出席庆祝大会的，有内蒙古党委书记、自治区副主席苏谦益、奎璧，候补书记权星垣，内蒙古军区副司令员刘华香，以及包头市和包钢的党政领导人。自治区各盟（市）委工业书记和盟（市）长，军分区司令员也应邀出席了大会。
    应邀出席庆祝大会的，还有帮助包钢建设的以克鲁克里柯夫为首的全体苏联专家。
    庆祝大会开始以前，上午九时许，乌兰夫在蒙汉族炼钢工人热烈欢迎下，来到包钢一号平炉车间，为包钢出钢剪彩。在奏乐和鞭炮声中，蒙古族炼钢工人、一号平炉炉长阿拉坦巴根和他的伙伴们，又成功地炼出了一炉钢水。出钢以后，乌兰夫接见了炼钢厂职工，和蒙汉族炼钢工人一一亲切地握手。
    这天，包钢职工喜气洋洋，炼钢区和昆都仑区街道上红旗招展，锣鼓喧天。设在包钢体育场的庆祝大会主席台中央悬挂着毛主席巨幅画像，台两旁高悬“高举毛泽东思想红旗奋勇前进”和“为高速度地建设包头钢铁工业基地而奋斗”等巨幅标语。台前欢聚着两万多名包钢职工。
    庆祝大会在上午十时半开始。包钢党委书记陈守中致开幕词以后，乌兰夫在大会上讲了话。
    他首先代表中共内蒙古自治区委员会和内蒙古自治区人民委员会，向在建设中发挥了高度积极性和创造性的全体包钢职工，向区内区外各支援包钢建设的单位，向热情帮助包钢建设的苏联专家们，致以热烈的祝贺和敬意。
    乌兰夫接着说，包钢一号平炉建成并投入生产，是继一号高炉出铁之后，在毛泽东思想的旗帜下，在总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的鼓舞下，在自治区建设中所取得的又一次新的胜利，是1960年继续跃进和深入开展技术革新、技术革命运动所取得的重大成就之一。包钢一号平炉的建成和投入生产，大大提高了内蒙古自治区炼钢生产能力和技术水平。随着包钢建设的加快，今后将生产出大批生铁、钢锭和钢材，供应国家和内蒙古自治区各项生产建设的需要。它使包头工业基地的建设又大大向前推进了一步，对改变自治区的面貌，使自治区蒙古族和其他各族人民经济、文化的发展水平尽快赶上全国先进的水平，起着重要作用。
    乌兰夫指出：包头工业基地已经跨入了基本建设和工业生产同时并进的阶段。因此，他要求包钢在继续加强领导，争取在较短的时间内提前完成包钢基本建设任务，保证全部工程尽早按质按量建成投入生产的同时，还必须搞好当前的钢铁生产，尽快地提高高炉、平炉的利用系数，增加钢铁产量，提高钢铁质量，降低成本，使包钢在社会主义经济建设中发挥更大的作用。
    乌兰夫还着重指出：包头工业基地已经具有一定规模，要发挥包头工业基地的作用，在完成本身生产任务的同时，要从技术设备、物质力量和技术管理、管理人材等方面，大力支援自治区各项建设，支援新建厂矿，支援农牧业生产。
    内蒙古自治区党委书记、中共包头市委第一书记苏谦益，也在大会上讲了话。他号召包钢职工乘胜前进，加速二号大高炉、第三座大焦炉、初轧、选矿烧结等重大工程系统的建设。他还号召炼钢厂与炼铁厂开展大协作，大竞赛，互相帮助，互相促进，努力完成钢铁生产任务，首先争取提前超额完成第二季度的生产任务。
    帮助包钢建设的苏联专家代理组长克鲁克里柯夫在会上讲了话。他盛赞包钢职工的英勇劳动，并对包钢建设者致以衷心的祝贺。
    最后，包钢炼钢区工委书记鲁立昆和炼钢厂党委书记兼厂长刘耀宗，在讲话中表示：坚决响应党的号召，保证提前完成国家交给的生产建设任务，作到高产优质，继续大跃进。
    在庆祝大会上，包钢负责人宣读了给苏联专家和支援包钢建设的全国各省市、各兄弟厂矿的感谢信。
    5日晚间，包钢举行了盛大的庆祝宴会和晚会。（附图片）
