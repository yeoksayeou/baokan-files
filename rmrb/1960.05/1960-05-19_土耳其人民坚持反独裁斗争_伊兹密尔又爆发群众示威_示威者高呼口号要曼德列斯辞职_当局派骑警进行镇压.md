Xinhua News Agency, 18th Dispatch from Izmir: About five hundred people held a demonstration in the Aegean port city of Izmir, Turkey, on the evening of the 17th. Most of the demonstrators were students, and they shouted slogans such as "Freedom" and "Menderes Resign!"

The demonstrating masses marched towards the local government office building, singing the Turkish national anthem. At this time, mounted police charged into the demonstration. It is reported that five demonstrators were arrested.

Public sentiment in Izmir against the U.S.-backed Menderes reactionary regime is running high, especially during Menderes' current "visit" to the city. When the Turkish Prime Minister arrived in Izmir from Istanbul on the 15th, approximately four thousand people held a demonstration demanding his resignation.

    新华社18日讯　伊兹密尔消息：在土耳其爱琴海港口城市伊兹密尔，17日傍晚有五百人举行了示威。示威者中大多数是学生，他们高呼“自由”和“曼德列斯辞职”等口号。
    示威群众向当地政府办公厅前进，并高唱土耳其国歌。这时，骑警冲入示威队伍。据报道，有五名示威者被捕。
    伊兹密尔公众反对美国扶植的曼德列斯反动政权的情绪，在目前曼德列斯到这个城市“访问”之际更见高涨。当土耳其总理15日从伊斯坦布尔到达伊兹密尔时，大约有四千人举行了示威，要求他辞职。
