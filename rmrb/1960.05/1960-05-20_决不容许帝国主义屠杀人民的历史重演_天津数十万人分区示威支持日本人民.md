Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, May 19th: People from all walks of life in Tianjin continue to hold widespread and in-depth activities, severely condemning the crimes of US imperialism in supporting Japanese militarism and threatening peace in Asia and the world, and resolutely supporting the just struggle of the Japanese people against the US-Japan military alliance treaty.
　　
In recent days, workers, farmers, cadres, and students in various districts have continued to hold demonstrations. On May 15th, the Heping, Hedong, Hongqiao, Nankai, Hebei and other districts mobilized demonstration teams composed of hundreds of thousands of people. Many militiamen in Hedong District participated in the parade carrying guns seized from the Japanese invaders more than a decade ago. Zhang Sen, a demobilized soldier who participated in the War of Resistance Against Japan, said: "Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. As long as the oppressed people unite, they will definitely be able to completely eliminate them." Jiang Zhifang, an employee of the Hongqiao District Pastry Company, after denouncing the atrocities of the Japanese devils who killed his father and uncle at a company meeting, angrily said: "The history of imperialist massacres of the people must never be allowed to repeat itself. We resolutely support the Japanese people's struggle to the end, overthrow US imperialism, and eradicate the root cause of launching aggressive wars."

Nearly 10,000 employees and family members of the Tianjin Dongya Wool and Linen Textile Factory have held rallies and demonstrations in recent days against US imperialism's revival of Japanese militarism. During the Japanese fascist invasion of China, this factory was forced to produce military sacks for Japanese militarism, and the workers carried out heroic resistance at that time. Now, when the workers of this factory heard that the US-Japan reactionaries were plotting new war conspiracies, they were all very indignant. At a rally, old worker Liu Tongxu angrily said: "The Chinese people who have stood up are not to be trifled with. If US imperialism dares to rearm Japan, it will surely be battered and bruised."

    决不容许帝国主义屠杀人民的历史重演
    天津数十万人分区示威支持日本人民
    据新华社天津19日电　天津市各界人民继续广泛深入地举行各种活动，严厉谴责美帝国主义扶植日本军国主义威胁亚洲和世界和平的罪行，坚决支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的正义斗争。
    连日以来，各区工人、农民、干部、学生，继续举行游行示威。15日，和平、河东、红桥、南开、河北等区出动了几十万人组成的示威队伍。河东区的许多民兵，举着十几年前从日本侵略者手里缴获的枪支参加游行。其中一位曾经参加过抗日战争的复员军人张森说：“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎，只要被压迫的人民团结起来，一定能彻底消灭它们”。红桥区糕点公司的职工蒋志芳，在公司举行的集会上控诉了日寇杀死他的父亲、叔父的暴行以后，愤怒地说：“决不许帝国主义屠杀人民的历史重演。我们坚决支持日本人民斗争到底，打倒美帝国主义，铲除发动侵略战争的祸根。”
    天津市东亚毛麻纺织厂近万名职工和家属连日来举行了反对美帝国主义复活日本军国主义的集会和示威游行。这个工厂在日本法西斯侵略中国期间曾被迫为日本军国主义生产军用麻袋，当时工人们进行了英勇的反抗。现在，这个厂的工人们听说美日反动派又在策划新的战争阴谋时，都非常愤慨。在一次集会上，老工人刘同叙愤怒地说：“站立起来的中国人民不是好惹的，美帝国主义胆敢重新武装日本，他一定会碰得头破血流。”
