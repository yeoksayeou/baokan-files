Yunnan
    Earth Railways Open to Traffic, Transforming Transportation
    Scaling New Heights, Building More
    (Xinhua News Agency, Kunming) People of all ethnic groups in Yunnan Province are self-reliantly building earth railways. Currently, 180 kilometers have been completed and opened to traffic, and another 186 kilometers are under intensive construction.
    The construction of earth railways has improved transportation conditions in some areas of Yunnan Province. For example, workers at the Kunming City Transportation Company worked hard for two months to build three earth railways totaling ten kilometers in length, closely connecting the Zhuan Tang Wharf on Dianchi Lake with the railway station and relevant warehouses, factories, and other material transportation units, realizing short-distance transportation by train and increasing transportation efficiency by more than twofold. Transportation workers sing about the earth railways: "For thousands of years, transportation relied on people carrying, one shoulder pole bending our backs. Now we've built ten thousand meters of earth railway, discarding shoulder poles and ropes together. Flatbed carts sleep while trains run, transportation efficiency increases step by step."
Xinjiang
    Establish Small-Scale Railway Headquarters
    Self-Manufacturing Rails, Locomotives, and Sleepers
    (Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi) The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, with its vast territory, is self-reliantly engaging in large-scale construction of local small-scale railways. To date, the region has completed more than 220 kilometers of roadbed engineering. A small-scale railway stretching 54 kilometers from the Urumqi South Station of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway to Liushugou has been completed and opened to traffic.
    This year, in addition to building earth railways on a large scale (nearly 300 kilometers have already been built), the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is also building small-scale railways between several major industrial and mining areas. According to plan, the region will complete fourteen small-scale railways, totaling more than 500 kilometers in length, by the end of the year. In the Urumqi area alone, more than ten small-scale railways will be built this year, with the Xishan marshalling station of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway as the center, connecting various important factories, mines, warehouses, and raw material bases, linking these major factories and mines with their raw materials, materials, and fuel bases.
    All the rails, locomotives, and sleepers for the small-scale railways built in the autonomous region this year are manufactured locally. In order to strengthen leadership in local railway construction work, the Autonomous Region Party Committee specially established the Small-Scale Railway Headquarters and Office last year, and instructed the Urumqi Railway Bureau to establish a Local Railway Management Office, responsible for the survey and design, technical guidance, and specific management of small-scale railway construction. For the manufacture of various equipment and materials such as rails, locomotives, carriages, and sleepers, relevant industrial and mining units are organized to engage in large-scale cooperation for production according to different circumstances.
Shaoyang Prefecture
    Earth Trains Operate Successively on Nine Lines
    Large Quantities of Ore and Coal Flowing into Steel Plants
    (Xinhua News Agency, Changsha) Shaoyang Prefecture, Hunan Province, is using indigenous methods and materials to build small-scale earth railways on a large scale. Of the twenty-six small-scale earth railways, totaling 181.5 kilometers in length, built throughout the prefecture last winter and this spring, nine have officially opened to traffic.
    In order to meet the needs of the rapid development of steel and coking coal production for transportation, the prefecture decided last winter to build twenty-six small-scale earth railways leading to forty-three larger factories, iron plants, coal mines, and iron ore mines, in order to ensure the continued leap forward in steel and coking coal production this year.
    The earth railways that have been completed and opened to traffic have demonstrated great power in transporting raw materials and fuels to factories and mines. In the past, Shaodong Iron Plant in Shaodong County needed six trucks and eight hundred flatbed carts, occupying more than one thousand laborers, to transport ore from the Dashiqiao mining area more than ten kilometers away, and the ore often could not be supplied in time. Now, with the construction of a small-scale earth railway, only two hundred people are needed for transportation, and more than five hundred tons of ore can be transported back every day, not only ensuring that the small blast furnace is well-fed, but also having reserves.

    保证钢铁小洋群运输畅通
    云南
    土铁路通车运输改观
    更上一层楼再建一批
    据新华社昆明电　云南省各族人民自力更生兴建土铁路。目前完工通车的已有一百八十公里，还有一百八十六公里正在加紧施工。
    土铁路的建设，改善了云南省部分地区的交通状况。如昆明市搬运公司职工奋战两个月，建成三条长达十公里的土铁路，把滇池边的篆塘码头与火车站及有关仓库、工厂等物资运输单位紧密连结起来，实现了短途运输列车化，提高运输效率两倍多。搬运工人们歌唱土铁路道：“千年搬运靠人挑，一根扁担压弯腰，修起万米土铁路，杠子绳子一起抛，板车睡觉列车跑，运输效率步步高。”
    新疆
    成立小洋铁路指挥部
    自造路轨机车和枕木
    据新华社乌鲁木齐电　地区辽阔的新疆维吾尔自治区，正在自力更生大办地方小洋铁路。到目前为止，全区已经完成路基工程二百二十多公里。从兰新铁路乌鲁木齐南站至柳树沟的一条长达五十四公里的小洋铁路，已经建成通车。
    今年，新疆维吾尔自治区除大办土铁路（目前已修成近三百公里）以外，在几个主要工矿区之间，还大建小洋铁路。按照计划，全区年底以前将建成总长五百多公里的小洋铁路十四条。仅乌鲁木齐地区，今年就要以兰新铁路西山编组站为中心，修建通向各重要工厂、矿山、仓库和原料基地的小洋铁路十多条，使这些主要厂矿同原料、材料和燃料基地连结起来。
    自治区今年修建的小洋铁路，全部钢轨、机车、枕木都是本区制造的。为了加强地方铁路建设工作的领导，自治区党委去年就专门成立了小洋铁路指挥部和办公室，并且责成乌鲁木齐铁路局成立了地方铁路管理处，负责小洋铁路建设的勘查设计、技术指导和具体管理工作。对于钢轨、机车、车厢、枕木等各项设备、材料的制造，则根据不同情况，组织有关工矿单位大搞协作进行生产。
    邵阳专区
    在九条线路上先后行驶土火车
    大批矿石煤炭源源涌进钢铁厂
    据新华社长沙电　湖南省邵阳专区用土办法、土材料，大办小土铁路。全区在去冬今春兴建的二十六条共长一百八十一点五公里的小土铁路，已有九条正式通车。
    这个专区为了满足钢铁煤焦生产迅速发展对运输的需要，去冬决定修筑通往四十三个较大的工厂、铁厂、煤矿、铁矿的二十六条小土铁路，以保证今年钢铁煤焦生产继续跃进。
    已经建成通车的土铁路，在给工厂、矿山运输原料、燃料等方面，显示了巨大的威力。邵东县邵东铁厂过去到相距十多公里的大石桥矿区运矿砂，要用六辆汽车，八百部板车，占用劳力一千多人，矿砂还往往不能及时供应；现在修通了一条小土铁路，只要二百个人搞运输，每天能运回矿砂五百多吨，不但保证了小高炉吃得饱，而且还有储备。
