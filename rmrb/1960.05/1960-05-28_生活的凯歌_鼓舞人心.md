    "Song of Life's Triumph" is Inspiring
    Zhang Geng
    "Song of Life's Triumph," recently performed by the China Pingju Theatre, is a good play reflecting the Great Leap Forward in commercial work.

    The play vividly presents the new face of commercial work to the audience. The new commerce that appears on the stage is not the old-fashioned, profit-seeking commerce, but commerce that promotes production, improves production, and serves the masses. Under the leadership of the Party, many people who work selflessly for the welfare of the masses, especially young people, have emerged, and there is a new relationship between salespeople and customers, as close as family.

    It not only shows the new face of commercial work, but also the great revolution in our urban life, the activities of preparing to establish people's communes. Here we see an unfolding panorama of life, with all kinds of characters: old and young activists, who work excitedly and tirelessly for the cause of the commune. There are also many women who have been liberated from the small circles of their families, working happily and diligently, living a pleasant new life they have never experienced before. Many of them have gone through a struggle to win this new life.

    The play also shows the enthusiastic support of the new commercial workers for the establishment of street people's communes. This not only brings the commercial workers and residents closer together, but also promotes the need for commercial work to change old methods and accelerate the Great Leap Forward. In the meantime, those who look at problems with an old perspective fall behind, and unconsciously become obstacles to the road forward, becoming objects of anxiety and persuasion for the people.

    Although this play has such rich content and so many characters, the whole play has a unified face, that is, the rich and inspiring atmosphere of the Great Leap Forward. This atmosphere runs through every aspect of the play: from the script, music, direction, performance to the stage art, they are closely combined into an artistic whole, serving well to express this exciting theme, embodying this theme in front of the audience in all aspects, making the audience excited, their hearts beating with the pulse of the play, that is, the pulse of this era.

    But this play is not only vivid and inspiring. It also prominently portrays the characters, such as young cadres like Zheng Xuehong and Liu Chunsheng, grassroots Party leaders like Gao Xia and Wang Yongxiang, street activists like Director Sun and Grandpa Zhao, and even Old Lady Chen, as well as managers like Liu Baozhong, who are responsible for their work but have short-sightedness and lack the idea of continuous revolution, and his old partner with a closed mind, as well as old owners from the exploiting class and those who live off rent, such as Pan Youcai and Fu Guixiang. Although many of these characters are not depicted much, they can give people a certain impression. In particular, Zhao Daye played by Chen Shaofang, Chen Laotaitai played by Hong Yunxia, and Sun Zhuren played by Xi Cailian left a deeper impression.

    The main characters are of course portrayed in the several cadres and the ideological struggle between them. This contradiction is well written. This is not a simple ideological contradiction, but an ideological struggle reflecting two roads. Manager Liu did not realize that the establishment of urban people's communes was a earth-shattering event, so he casually sent Pan Youcai, a petty owner who had not been well reformed, to participate in the work team. He completely did not realize that this kind of person still has that stubborn class inferiority. However, young Secretary Gao Xia is in sharp contrast to Manager Liu. She not only carefully studies and understands the instructions of the higher Party committee and has a keen sense of new things, but also has a sharp class sense of smell. Although Union Chairman Wang Yongxiang and Manager Liu have been together since childhood, with the same background and experience, he is a firm figure in implementing the Party's policies and supporting the reforms of the young people. He always stands on the Party's position to fight against Manager Liu's conservative ideas. When Manager Liu was shocked to discover the terrible consequences of his mistakes, when he was deeply moved by the selfless communist labor enthusiasm of the young people, and when he saw the achievements of the masses' revolutionary enthusiasm, he finally figured it out with the help of the Party. Around this struggle, the images of these characters also stand up. But I also feel that in this play, some prominent figures among the masses, such as Grandpa Zhao, Old Lady Chen, and Director Sun, are more impressive than the prominent figures among the cadres. Of course, the cadres in this play are more difficult to play, with more ideological contradictions and struggles, but precisely because of this, actors need to analyze the characters more deeply, understand them more carefully, and feel them more sincerely. This requires actors to put more effort into art, and even more attention to the exercise of thoughts and feelings and self-transformation in peacetime.

    Many dances are used in the play, such as the dance at the opening and the folk dance in the last scene, which are used very well, greatly increasing the lively atmosphere of the play, and are also very harmonious with the artistic style of the whole play.

    In terms of music, Manager Liu's singing in expressing his inner struggle until his thought is completely clear is well expressed, and Manager Liu's wife's tune is also very good. Comrade Zhang Junqing also has her own characteristics in singing, especially the passage in the mica factory is very able to express the character's feelings. These several old actors have played very well in singing.

    The stage art of this play is very successful. Concise, vivid, and cheerful, with a folk style, but also with a new style, it has done its best to render the atmosphere, set off the theme, and strengthen the infection. The background uses Beijing's new buildings, which also helps to strengthen the atmosphere of the Great Leap Forward.

    Finally, it must be mentioned that the creation of this play is closely linked with the creators of the new life praised in the play, and was jointly created by amateur authors from the Beijing Municipal Commercial Department under the direct concern of the Finance and Trade Department of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee. This is the fundamental reason for ensuring the ideological and artistic success of this play.

    “生活的凯歌”鼓舞人心
    张庚
    最近中国评剧院演出的“生活的凯歌”是一出反映商业工作大跃进的好戏。
    这出戏很形象地把崭新的商业工作的面貌展示在观众的面前。在舞台上新出现的商业完全不是那种旧式孳孳为利的商业，而是促进生产，提高生产，为群众服务的商业。这里在党的领导下出现了许多为了群众的福利而忘我地工作着的人们，特别是青年人，也出现了售货员与顾客的全新的关系，亲如一家人的关系。
    这里不仅仅表现了商业工作的新面貌，还表现了我们城市生活的大革命，筹备建立人民公社的活动。我们在这里看见了一幅展开的生活图景，其中有各种各样的人物：年老的、年青的积极分子，他们为了公社的事业兴奋地、不知疲倦地工作着。这里还有许多从家庭小圈子里解放出来的妇女，她们欢欣鼓舞地，但又十分辛勤地劳动着，过着她们从来没有过过的愉快的新生活。她们中间的许多人为了争取这种新生活是经过了一番斗争的。
    戏里还表现了新的商业工作者热情地支援了街道人民公社的成立。这一面使得商业工作者和居民的关系更加密切，一面也促使着商业工作必须改变老办法，加速地向前跃进。而在这中间，用老眼光看问题的人就落后了，就不自觉地成了前进道路上的障碍，成了人们为他焦急，向他进行说服教育的对象。
    这个戏虽然有如此丰富的内容，出场的人物虽然也很多，但是整个戏却是具有统一的面貌，那就是充沛的、鼓舞人心的大跃进的气氛。这种气氛贯串到戏的每一个方面：从剧本、音乐、导演、表演到舞台美术，它们紧密地结合起来成为一个艺术整体，很好地为了表现这个激动人心的主题服务，从各方面把这个主题形象化在观众面前，使观众兴奋不已，他们的心随着戏的脉搏，也就是这个时代的脉搏一同跳动起来。
    但这个戏却又不止于鲜明触目和有鼓舞性。它还突出地刻划了人物，像郑学红、刘春生这样的青年干部，像高霞、王永祥这样的党的基层领导，像孙主任、赵大爷以至于陈老太太这些街道的积极分子，此外也有刘保忠这样对工作虽负责、但眼光短浅没有不断革命思想的经理和他那脑筋闭塞的老伴，还有那原来属于剥削阶级的旧业主和吃房租的人如潘有才、傅桂香。这许多人物形象，有的虽然描绘不多，却都能给人一定的印象。特别像陈少舫演的赵大爷、红云霞演的陈老太太和喜彩莲演的孙主任给人的印象较深。
    主要的人物描绘当然还是在几个干部和他们之间的思想斗争。这个矛盾是写得较好的。这不是一个简单的思想矛盾，这是一场反映了两条道路的思想斗争。刘经理没有认识到建立城市人民公社是一件翻天复地的大事情，就随便派潘有才这样的没有改造好的小业主去参加工作组。他完全没有认识到这种人还存在着那种顽强的阶级劣根性。而年轻支书高霞却恰恰和刘经理成为一个对比，她不但认真研究和体会上级党的指示，对新鲜事物有着敏锐的感觉，而且还有着尖锐的阶级嗅觉；工会主任王永祥和刘经理虽然是从小在一起，出身和遭遇都相同，但是在执行党的政策和支持青年们的改革上却是一个坚定的人物，他在任何时候都是站在党的立场上来和刘经理的保守思想作斗争的。当刘经理大吃一惊地发现了自己的错误行为所产生的糟糕后果的时候，当他被青年们废寝忘食的共产主义劳动热情所深深感动的时候，当他看见群众革命热情得到了成绩的时候，他终于在党的帮助之下想通了。围绕着这个斗争，这几个人物的形象也就立起来了。但我也觉得在这个戏里，似乎一些群众中间的突出人物如赵大爷、陈老太太、孙主任等比之干部中间的突出人物给人的印象更加深刻一些。当然，这个戏里的干部是比较难演，有着较多的思想矛盾和斗争，不过也正因为这样，就需要演员对人物分析得更深刻一些，体会得更细致一些，感受得更真切一些。这一方面是要求演员在艺术上多下点工夫，另一面却更要求演员平日在思想感情的锻炼上，在自我改造上有更多的注意。
    戏里用了许多舞蹈，如开场时的舞蹈和最后一场的民间舞蹈都用得很好，大大增加戏的热烈气氛，也和整个戏的艺术风格很调和。
    音乐方面，刘经理的唱腔在表现他内心的斗争一直到他思想完全明朗这个发展过程表现得很好，刘妻的腔也很好，张筠青同志在演唱方面也确有特色，尤其在云母工厂的一段唱是很能表达人物感情的。这好几位老演员在唱的方面都发挥得很好。
    这个戏的舞台美术很成功。简练、鲜明、开朗，有着民间的风格，但又有新的气派，尽到了渲染气氛，烘托主题、加强感染的任务。背景用了北京的新建筑也很帮助加强了跃进的气氛。
    最后还必须提起这个戏的创作是紧密地和戏里所歌颂的新生活的创造者们直接结合起来，在中共北京市委财贸部直接关怀下和北京市商业部门业余作者共同创作出来的。这是保证这个戏得到思想上和艺术上成功的根本原因。
