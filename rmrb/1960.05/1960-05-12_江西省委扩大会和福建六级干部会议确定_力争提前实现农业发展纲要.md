    The Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China held its Ninth Plenary (Enlarged) Session of the Fifth Committee from March 28th to April 10th. The meeting called on the entire party and the people of the province to strive to complete and overfulfill the 1960 national economic plan, to achieve a sustained great leap forward in socialist construction, and to achieve the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule. Yang Shangkui, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, delivered a report at the meeting.

    The meeting analyzed the current situation. On the agricultural front, water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation and manufacturing, afforestation, bamboo and wood felling, etc., this year have greatly exceeded the original plan, and overwintering crops are also growing well, with a new high tide of spring plowing and production already formed. On the industrial front, victories have been achieved in the first quarter, with a good start and an overall success. Great achievements have also been made in transportation, capital construction, finance and trade, science and culture, education and health. A technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation is rapidly unfolding throughout the province's industrial and mining enterprises, people's communes, and various fronts. This has created extremely favorable conditions for comprehensively completing and overfulfilling the various planned tasks for 1960 and for achieving the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule.

    In order to strive to achieve the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule, we must first concentrate our efforts to resolutely fight this battle of spring plowing and production this year. Continue to implement the policy of combining multiple planting with high yields. On the one hand, actively reclaim wasteland, expand cultivated land area, increase the multiple cropping index, and ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the sowing plans for various spring-sown crops; make full use of wasteland, field ridges, and all available scattered land to increase the production of potatoes, melons, and other miscellaneous grains. On the other hand, comprehensively promote agricultural production increase measures centered on the "Eight-Character Charter," resolutely overcome natural disasters such as waterlogging, drought, pests, and diseases, and universally increase yield per unit area. Strive for an all-round bumper harvest of grains, cotton, oil, hemp, silk, tea, sugar, vegetables, tobacco, fruits, medicines, and miscellaneous crops, and an all-round great leap forward in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries.

    In the industrial sector, we should focus on the key links of steel, iron, and coal. Further develop the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation.

    The meeting pointed out that accelerating the technical transformation of agriculture first requires strengthening industrial support for agriculture. The industrial front must arm agriculture with more agricultural farming machinery, irrigation and drainage machinery, processing machinery, transportation tools, feeding tools, fishing tools, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and science and technology. To achieve this goal, provincial, special district, and county enterprises should, as far as possible, undertake the task of arming commune enterprises.

    The meeting believes that the main task in the work of the people's communes at present is to fully tap potential, accelerate technical transformation, comprehensively develop production, and vigorously increase income. On this basis, actively increase the proportion of collectively owned economy and strive to help "poor" teams catch up with "rich" teams.

    After discussing the active development and consolidation of urban people's communes, the meeting called for a serious summing up of the experience of the established urban people's communes and gradually realizing the communization of cities.

    The meeting believes that in order to carry out socialist construction at high speed, cadres at all levels must work hard to study Comrade Mao Zedong's works.

    Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, April 5th. The Fujian Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a Six-Level Cadre Meeting from March 25th to April 5th to discuss how to mobilize and concentrate all forces to achieve a great leap forward in production and further consolidate and develop the people's communes. The meeting called on the entire party and all the people to strive for a better and more comprehensive leap forward in 1960 and to achieve the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule. Ye Fei, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, delivered a report.

    The meeting analyzed the current situation in Fujian Province. The province's total industrial output value in the first quarter exceeded the state plan by 22%, an increase of 34% over the fourth quarter of last year. Agricultural production also achieved a good start, with an unprecedented bumper harvest of four million mu of wheat and barley across the province. The average yield per mu of harvested wheat and barley has increased by more than 50% compared with last year. Some teams have created the miracle of spring wheat exceeding early rice, removing the label of low yield of spring wheat in Fujian's history. With the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production, the spring of this year has seen a vigorous and sustained great leap forward on the fronts of finance and trade, culture and education, health, politics and law, and coastal anti-enemy struggle.

    The meeting pointed out that further consolidating and developing the people's communes will powerfully promote the sustained great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. Although Fujian Province suffered several typhoons of level 12 or above and exceptionally heavy floods last year, the production of the entire rural people's communes still achieved an all-round great leap forward. Last year, the province's total agricultural output value increased by 29% compared with 1958, 93.6% of commune members increased their income, and one-third of the poor teams caught up with the rich teams. The collectively owned economy has also developed greatly, especially in the development of "Wanbaoshan," the people's communes have demonstrated unparalleled superiority.

    The meeting pointed out that the people's communes should currently strengthen leadership over the production teams and develop the economy of the production teams, so that the economies of both the communes and the production teams can be rapidly developed.

    The meeting pointed out that to achieve a better and more comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production this year, it is necessary to vigorously launch a mass movement for spring harvesting and spring planting, resolutely implement the policy of multiple planting, high yield, and multiple harvests, and make every effort to complete the task of expanding early rice planting to nine million mu without losing a single mu, and strive to exceed it.

    In order to ensure the accelerated development of agricultural production, the meeting emphasized vigorously carrying out agricultural tool reform, actively promoting rice transplanters, harvesting and threshing tools, and requiring all localities to comprehensively care for the masses' lives and run collective living welfare undertakings centered on canteens.

    The meeting also studied industrial production and requested that coal and iron production in the second quarter be doubled compared with the first quarter.

    In order to ensure the completion of various tasks, the meeting emphasized that it is necessary to further improve working methods and working styles, requiring leading cadres and office cadres at all levels to go out of their offices, go deep into the grassroots, participate in production, and lead production.

    江西省委扩大会和福建六级干部会议确定
    力争提前实现农业发展纲要
    本报讯　中共江西省委于3月28日至4月10日召开了五届九次全体（扩大）会议。会议号召全党和全省人民，为完成和超额完成1960年的国民经济计划，为实现社会主义建设的持续大跃进，为提前实现全国农业发展纲要而奋斗。省委第一书记杨尚奎在会上作了报告。
    会议分析了当前的形势。在农业战线上，今年兴修水利、积肥造肥、植树造林、竹木砍伐等大大超过原来计划，越冬作物也生长良好，春耕生产的新高潮已经形成。在工业战线上，取得了首季开门红、满堂红的胜利。交通运输、基本建设、财政贸易、科学文化、教育卫生等方面，都取得了很大成绩。一个以机械化、半机械化和自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，正在迅速地向全省工矿企业、人民公社和各个战线展开。为全面完成和超额完成1960年的各项计划任务，为提前实现全国农业发展纲要创造了极其良好的条件。
    为了力争提前实现全国农业发展纲要，当前应当首先集中力量，坚决打好今年春耕生产这一仗。继续贯彻执行多种多收和高产多收相结合的方针。一方面，积极开垦荒地，扩大耕地面积，提高复种指数，保证完成和超额完成各种春播作物的播种计划；充分利用荒地、田塍和一切可以利用的零星土地，增加薯类、瓜类和其他杂粮作物的生产。另一方面，全面推广以“八字宪法”为中心的农业增产措施，坚决战胜水、旱、虫、病等自然灾害，普遍提高单位面积产量。力争粮、棉、油、麻、丝、茶、糖、菜、烟、果、药、杂的全面大丰收，农、林、牧、副、渔各业的全面大跃进。
    在工业方面，应该大抓钢、铁、煤的主要环节。进一步开展以机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动。
    会议指出，加速农业的技术改造，首先是加强工业对农业的支援。工业战线上必须用更多的农业耕作机械、排灌机械、加工机械、运输工具、饲养工具、捕捞工具、化肥、农药和科学技术来武装农业。为了达到这个目的，省、专、县企业，都应尽可能地担负武装公社企业的任务。
    会议认为，目前在人民公社工作中的主要任务，是充分挖掘潜力，加速技术改造，全面发展生产，大力增加收入。在这个基础上，积极提高社有经济的比重，努力帮助“穷”队赶上“富”队。
    会议讨论了积极发展和巩固城市人民公社的工作以后，要求认真总结已办的城市人民公社的经验，逐步实现城市人民公社化。
    会议认为，为了高速度地进行社会主义建设，各级干部一定要下苦功学习毛泽东同志的著作。
    本报讯　中共福建省委于3月25日到4月5日召开了六级干部会议，讨论了如何动员和集中一切力量实现生产大跃进和进一步巩固发展人民公社等问题。会议号召全党全民为实现1960年更好更全面的跃进和提前实现全国农业发展纲要而奋斗。省委第一书记叶飞作了报告。
    会议分析了福建省当前的形势。全省第一季度工业总产值超额22％完成了国家计划，比去年第四季度增长34％。农业生产也实现了开门红，全省四百万亩大小麦获得了空前未有的大丰收，目前已收割的大小麦、单产平均比去年增加50％多，有若干队创造了春麦超早稻的奇迹，摘掉了福建历史上春麦低产的帽子。随着工农业生产的飞跃发展，财政贸易、文教、卫生、政法以及沿海对敌斗争等战线，今年春季都出现了蓬蓬勃勃的持续大跃进的局面。
    会议指出，进一步巩固和发展人民公社将有力地促进工农业生产持续大跃进。福建全省去年虽然连续遭受数次十二级以上的台风和特大的洪水灾害，但整个农村人民公社的生产仍然取得了全面大跃进。去年全省农业总产值比1958年增加29％，有93.6％的社员增加了收入，并有三分之一的穷队赶上了富队，社有经济也有很大发展，特别是在开发“万宝山”中，人民公社显示了无比优越性。
    会议指出，人民公社目前应加强对生产队的领导，发展生产队的经济，使公社、生产队的经济都得到迅速的发展。
    会议指出，要实现今年农业生产更好更全面的跃进，当前要大搞春收春种的群众运动，坚决贯彻多种、高产、多收的方针，千方百计地一亩不少地完成九百万亩早稻扩种任务，并力争超过。
    为了保证加速发展农业生产，会议强调大搞农具改革，积极推广插秧机，收割、脱粒工具，并要求各地全面关心群众生活，办好以食堂为中心的集体生活福利事业。
    会议对工业生产也作了研究，要求第二季度煤铁产量比第一季度有成倍的增长。
    为了保证各项任务的完成，会议强调指出，必须进一步改进工作方法和工作作风，要求各级领导干部和机关干部，走出办公室深入基层，参加生产，领导生产。
