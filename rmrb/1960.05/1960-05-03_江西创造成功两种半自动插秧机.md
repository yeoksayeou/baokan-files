Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang -- Jiangxi Province has successfully created two types of semi-automatic rice transplanters. Recently, the Jiangxi Provincial People's Committee and the Jiangxi Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences jointly held an identification and naming ceremony, naming the two rice transplanters "Jiangxi 60-1" and "Jiangxi 60-2." The Jiangxi Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences issued a certificate of identification, and they are pre-approved for promotion.

These two types of rice transplanters are a step forward compared to the "Jiangxi 59 Type" rice transplanter. With only one person pulling it, it can automatically transplant rice seedlings row by row. Using the "Jiangxi 60-1" rice transplanter, one person with one machine can transplant 16 to 20 mu of rice in one day (ten hours), which is two to three times more efficient than the "Jiangxi 59 Type" rice transplanter and ten to twelve times more efficient than manual transplanting. Moreover, the transplanting is straight and stable, and the speed, row spacing, and plant spacing are always consistent, fully meeting the requirements of close planting. In addition, the seedling box can be automatically adjusted up and down, so it is highly adaptable and can transplant early rice, late rice, water seedlings, dry seedlings, old seedlings, and tender seedlings. Using the "Jiangxi 60-2" rice transplanter, one person with one machine can transplant 18 to 20 mu of rice in one day (ten hours), with an efficiency eleven to twelve times higher than manual transplanting. Because these two types of rice transplanters are not limited by technology during operation, general labor can use them.

The creators of the "Jiangxi 60-1" rice transplanter are Liu Jianzhong, a watchmaker from Yiyang County, and Yu Zixin and Zhang Zixin, carpenters. The creator of the "Jiangxi 60-2" rice transplanter is Wang Tongrong, a worker at the Gao'an County Machinery Factory.

The creation of these two types of rice transplanters has received strong support from Party organizations. During the creation of the "Jiangxi 60-1" rice transplanter, the Yiyang County Party Committee, headed by the County Party Secretary, formed a research group to do everything possible to help solve difficulties in raw materials, equipment, and technology. When Wang Tongrong was creating the "Jiangxi 60-2" rice transplanter, the factory Party branch proposed: "Supply whatever is needed, and help solve whatever difficulties arise," and organized eight technical researchers to participate in the trial production, ensuring the smooth progress of the creation work. The entire creation time was only more than two months. The Yiyang County Party Committee also organized extensive cooperation between hardware factories, machinery factories, woodworking factories, and commercial departments, and mobilized technical workers and farmers to participate in mass research activities, so that problems such as the heavy body, unbalanced power, and malfunctioning seedling box movement were continuously resolved.

    江西创造成功两种半自动插秧机
    据新华社南昌讯　江西省创造成功两种半自动化插秧机。最近，江西省人民委员会、中国科学院江西分院联合举行鉴定命名仪式、命名这两种插秧机为“江西60—1号”、“江西60—2号”，并由中国科学院江西分院签发鉴定书，预定型准推广。
    这两种插秧机比“江西五九型”插秧机又前进了一步，只要一个人拖着走，就能自动地把秧苗一行行插好。使用“江西60—1号”插秧机，一人一机一天（十小时）可插秧十六到二十亩，比“江西五九型”插秧机的工效高两倍到三倍，比手工插秧高十倍到十二倍。而且插得直，插得稳，快慢和行距株距始终一致，完全符合密植要求。另外，秧箱能够上下自动调节，因此适应性强，无论早稻、晚稻，水秧、旱秧、老秧、嫩秧都可以插。使用“江西60—2号”插秧机，一人一机一天（十小时）可以插秧十八到二十亩，工效比手工插秧高十一倍到十二倍。这两种插秧机因为在操作时不受技术限制，一般劳动力都会使用。
    “江西60—1号”插秧机的创造者是弋阳县钟表匠刘建中、木工余自新和张自新。“江西60—2号”插秧机的创造者是高安县机械厂工人汪同荣。
    这两种插秧机的创制，都得到了党组织的大力支持。在“江西60—1号”插秧机的创制过程中，中共弋阳县委曾以县委书记为首组成研究小组，千方百计地帮助解决原材、设备、技术方面的困难。汪同荣在创制“江西60—2号”插秧机时，工厂党支部提出：“要什么供应什么，有什么困难帮助解决什么困难”，并且组织八名技术研究员参加试制，保证了创制工作的顺利进行，全部创制时间只两个多月。中共弋阳县委还组织五金厂、机械厂、木工厂和商业部门的广泛协作，吸收技术工人、农民参加，开展“人人献计，个个出力”的群众性研究活动，使得原来机身重、动力不平衡、秧箱移动失灵等问题不断得到解决。（附图片）
