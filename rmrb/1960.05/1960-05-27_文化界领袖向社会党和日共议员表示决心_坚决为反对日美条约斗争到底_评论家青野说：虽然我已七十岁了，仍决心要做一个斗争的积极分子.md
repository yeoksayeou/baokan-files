Approximately fifty university professor representatives and cultural leaders met with Socialist and Communist Party congressmen on the evening of the 24th at the Japanese Diet Building, handing them a resolution passed a few hours earlier at a gathering of cultural figures in Kanda opposing the new "Security Treaty."

Uehara Nagaro, Aono Suekichi, Uno Jukichi, Shimizu Ikutaro, and Tsurumi Kazuko, representing professors and artists, first expressed to the Socialist Party congressmen their determination to persist in the struggle against the new "Security Treaty" to the end.

Uehara Nagaro, a professor at Hitotsubashi University, demanded in his speech that Socialist Party members live up to the people's expectations and conduct an uncompromising struggle against Nobusuke Kishi. Shimizu Ikutaro, a professor at Gakushuin University, said that the Japanese people would never forget the atrocities committed by the Nobusuke Kishi group of the Liberal Democratic Party on May 19th and 20th. He praised the Socialist Party's persistent struggle in the Diet, and said that those outside the Diet would never relax their struggle until the Diet was dissolved and the new "Security Treaty" was abolished.

The famous stage actor Uno Jukichi told the Socialist Party congressmen that the people support their struggle against the new "Security Treaty."

The famous commentator Aono emphasized that the people should not expect Nobusuke Kishi to have any conscience. He said, "Although I am already seventy years old, I am still determined to be an active participant in the struggle against the new 'Security Treaty,' and fight to the end." He said that Japan's fate depends on this struggle.

The commentator Tsurumi told the Socialist Party congressmen that letters from friends in the United States recently gave him great encouragement. He said that these letters told him that there are many friends of peace in the United States. This shows that the Japanese people's struggle against the new "Security Treaty" is supported by the people of all countries in the world. Inajiro Asanuma, Chairman of the Japan Socialist Party, held talks with university professors and cultural leaders.

After the meeting with the Socialist Party congressmen ended, the professors and cultural leaders visited Sanzo Nosaka, Chairman of the Japanese Communist Party, and Goro Sudo, a member of the House of Councillors, and handed them their resolution.

Subsequently, they held a sit-in demonstration outside Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi's official residence, demanding a meeting with Nobusuke Kishi. However, Nobusuke Kishi refused to meet with them.

    文化界领袖向社会党和日共议员表示决心
    坚决为反对日美条约斗争到底
    评论家青野说：虽然我已七十岁了，仍决心要做一个斗争的积极分子
    大约五十名大学教授代表和文化界领袖24日晚在日本国会大厦会见了社会党和共产党的国会议员，交给他们一份几小时以前在神田举行的文化界人士反对新“安全条约”大会上通过的决议。
    上原长禄、青野季吉、宇野重吉、清水几太郎和鹤见和子代表教授和艺术家先向社会党国会议员表示了他们决心要把反对新“安全条约”的斗争坚持到底。
    一桥大学教授上原长禄在讲话中要求社会党党员能符合人民的希望，同岸信介进行毫不妥协的斗争。学习院大学教授清水几太郎说，日本人民决不会忘记自由民主党岸信介集团在5月19日和20日的暴行。他赞扬社会党在国会中坚持不懈的斗争，并说，那些在国会外面的人将绝不放松斗争，直到解散国会和废除新“安全条约”为止。
    著名的舞台演员宇野重吉告诉社会党议员，人民支持他们的反对新“安全条约”的斗争。
    著名的评论家青野强调指出，人民不应当指望岸信介还有一点良知。他说，“虽然我已经七十岁了，但是我仍然决心要做一个反对新‘安全条约’斗争的积极分子，斗争到最后。”他说日本的命运取决于这场斗争。
    评论家鹤见告诉社会党国会议员说，最近在美国的朋友的来信给了他很大鼓舞。他说，这些信告诉他：在美国，有许多和平朋友。这表明，日本人民反对新“安全条约”的斗争得到世界上各国人民的支持。日本社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎同大学教授和文化界领袖们进行了谈话。
    同社会党国会议员举行的集会结束以后，这些教授和文化界的领袖们拜访了日本共产党主席野坂参三和参议院议员须藤五郎，并把他们的决议交给他们。
    随后，他们到岸信介首相官邸外面举行了静坐示威，要求会见岸信介。但岸信介拒绝会见他们。
