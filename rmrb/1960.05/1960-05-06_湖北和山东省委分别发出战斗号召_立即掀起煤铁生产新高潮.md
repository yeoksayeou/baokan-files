    Hubei and Shandong Provincial Committees Issue Battle Calls
    To Immediately Launch a New Upsurge in Coal and Iron Production

　　(Our newspaper reports) The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently convened a conference of the province's four major steel plants and key coal mining areas, issuing a call to the province's workers to fight hard in May and June, organize a steel battle centered on coal, iron, ore, and transportation, drive everything forward, and complete approximately 50% of the state plan in the first half of the year.
    At these two meetings, Zhang Tixue, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Governor of the province, delivered speeches. He called on leaders at all levels and the vast number of workers to hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, adhere to putting politics in command, persist in continuous revolution, implement the spirit of rectification, have leading cadres go to the front lines, extensively and deeply mobilize the masses, vigorously promote technical innovation and technical revolution, organize key project battles, launch a vigorous upsurge in coal and iron production, drive other departments forward, and complete approximately 50% of the annual plan (major product output plan) in the first half of the year.
    The Provincial Committee requires that the industrial secretaries of local, municipal, and county committees focus on coal and iron production, and organize capable cadres to go deep into the field to help solve problems. Leaders of various departments and enterprises should implement the spirit of rectification, hold fewer or no meetings during this period, do more practical work, go to the forefront of production, personally be present at the furnace and construction sites, organize production, carry forward a resolute and vigorous work style, accurately grasp one task, and take various measures to grasp it firmly, relentlessly, and thoroughly.
    The Provincial Committee pointed out that vigorously promoting technical innovation and technical revolution is an important guarantee for achieving victory in the steel battle centered on coal, iron, ore, and transportation. The spearhead of the technical revolution must be directed at the key to production, focusing on the key to coal and iron production, such as reducing the coke ratio and using local coal for coking, organize key project battles to quickly achieve breakthroughs. In the technical revolution movement, it is necessary to adopt a fighting posture, take active measures, and carry out technical transformation of small blast furnaces and small coal kilns. Local coal and iron production units should also vigorously develop diversified operations and comprehensive utilization. Departments such as materials, transportation, machinery, and electricity should vigorously serve the steel battle while actively supporting agriculture. The transportation front must transport efficiently to ensure coal and iron; the electricity department must ensure safe power supply. In the steel battle organized in May and June, leaders at all levels must closely care about the lives of the masses, ensuring that workers eat well, sleep well, and work well, achieving a combination of work and rest. At the same time, measures for preventing heatstroke and cooling down should be taken in advance to ensure safe production.
    The units participating in the meeting enthusiastically supported the call of the meeting and were determined to fight hard in May and June to ensure the victory of the steel battle, laying a solid material foundation for completing this year's national economic plan.

    (Our newspaper reports) The Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a telephone conference on April 29, calling on workers throughout the province to fight hard in the Red May and strive to increase the daily output of pig iron, coke, ore, and coal.
    At the meeting, Deng Chenxi, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Provincial Committee, conveyed the decision of the Provincial Committee and put forward specific requirements. In order to rapidly increase the daily output of pig iron, the Provincial Committee requires all localities to immediately take strong measures: First, grasp the technical transformation and construction of large and small blast furnaces, vigorously develop artificial rich ore, and rapidly increase the grade of ore entering the furnace to more than 50% through vigorously developing ore powder washing, selection, sintering, and ore roasting. Second, in order to increase the daily output of coke, it is necessary to conscientiously learn and promote advanced experiences, strengthen management, and speed up the construction of coke ovens. All coke plants should reduce coal consumption rates, use less coal, and produce more coke. Third, mines should vigorously carry out technical revolution, carry forward the spirit of self-reliance, and accelerate transformation; machinery manufacturing and other departments should actively manufacture equipment for mines; all mines should strengthen equipment maintenance, train technicians, give full play to equipment efficiency, and improve labor efficiency. It is also necessary to strengthen transportation management and material yard management to reduce ore consumption. Fourth, coal production should carry out 100-meter and 10,000-ton competition movements, that is, the monthly progress of each working face should reach 100 meters, and the monthly output should reach 10,000 tons. At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen development and tunneling work to ensure a double harvest of mining and tunneling, and achieve large-scale high yields. It is also necessary to effectively improve coal quality, ensure safe production, and vigorously save and substitute pit props. Fifth, transportation is the most prominent weak link at present, so efforts must be concentrated to solve it. On the one hand, it is necessary to fully tap the potential of existing transportation tools, and on the other hand, it is necessary to vigorously develop local railways and light railways, with dedicated personnel responsible for completing them within a time limit; it is also necessary to arrange for the manufacture of locomotives and vehicles as soon as possible so that local railways and light railways can quickly play their role after completion. Sixth, the power industry should improve equipment output and ensure safe power supply.
    Regarding steel and steel production, the Provincial Committee proposed that local small-scale iron and steel complexes should be established quickly. It is necessary to promote the advanced experience of converter steelmaking and steel rolling within a time limit to improve the output and quality of steel and steel products.
    Comrade Deng Chenxi emphasized that in order to rapidly improve the daily production level of pig iron, it is necessary to launch a vigorous mass movement and better mobilize the masses. The right-leaning conservative ideas of some cadres must be overcome immediately, and greater revolutionary drive must be exerted. It is necessary to oppose bureaucratic work styles and further improve the relationship between leaders and the masses. At the same time, it is necessary to continue to carry out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on the "four modernizations."
