Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 3rd: A Japanese academic delegation for the study of Chinese character reform, consisting of ten members, returned to Tokyo by plane on the 3rd.

    At a press conference held in the waiting room, the head of the delegation, Toki Zemmaro, said that Japan could only achieve independence by abolishing the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." Furthermore, the abolition of the "Security Treaty" is inextricably linked to the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations and Sino-Japanese cultural exchange.

    Toki said that through this visit to China, he realized that the Chinese people sincerely desire to have friendly relations with the Japanese people. He also said that China would never invade Japan.

    Toki pointed out that the root cause of the lack of restored diplomatic relations between Japan and China lies in the policies implemented by the Nobusuke Kishi government.

    Toki also reported on the findings of the study of Chinese character reform, saying that this study has many benefits for the reform of Japanese writing.
