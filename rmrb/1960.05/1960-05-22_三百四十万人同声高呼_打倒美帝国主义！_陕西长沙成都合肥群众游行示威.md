In the past, we have made unremitting efforts to strive for world peace, and we will continue to persist in the struggle in the future.

Today, we must not sit down to negotiate with U.S. imperialism, which hides a knife in its heart, but must carry out a resolute struggle against it to achieve victory." Grandma Liang Yongzhen, who is more than sixty years old, led her grandma choir and angrily sang her newly composed song today: "U.S. imperialism is so hateful, creating war to harm the people. You sabotaged the Four-Power Conference and blamed others for it. No matter how you change your tricks, the people have long seen through your ugly face. If we don't overthrow you one day, we will never stop fighting!"
