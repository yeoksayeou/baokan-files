    Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 12th: Anshan Iron and Steel Company (Angang) workers are carrying out a large-scale joint technical performance competition week. From blast furnaces to open-hearth furnaces, from mines to rolling mills, the competition is reaching a fever pitch. In the three days since the 8th, the output of steel, pig iron, steel products, steel billets, and coke has increased day by day. Among them, the average daily output of pig iron, steel products, and steel billets has increased by more than 3% to 5% compared with the previous seven days.
    In the joint technical performance competition, each factory and mine checked the production situation in the previous stage, identified the key to production, and launched a tackling-key-problems performance. After the workers of No. 10 Blast Furnace of the Ironmaking Plant identified the two key production points of slag discharge and iron tapping, they promoted the new slag discharge experience of "frequent discharge and frequent plugging" created by young worker Chen Guixiu throughout the furnace. In three days, they produced 150 tons more pig iron than planned.
    
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 12th: Shanghai's iron and steel industry workers launched a steel production battle in May and achieved new results. As of the 10th, according to statistics from the Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant, Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, and Shanghai No. 5 Steel Plant under the Municipal Metallurgical Bureau, the first-class product rate of converter steel reached 87%, exceeding the average level of the entire bureau in April; the consumption of pig iron per ton of steel was universally reduced to below 1,300 kg.
    After entering May, Shanghai's steel plants further intensified technological transformation, so that the effective advanced experience quickly blossomed and bore fruit in production, thereby further shortening the smelting time and increasing the daily output of steel. On the 10th, the output of open-hearth steel in the Municipal Metallurgical Bureau system created the highest daily output record since this year.
    
    Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 12th: Chongqing Iron and Steel Company workers carried out technical innovation and technical revolution targeting key production issues in the Great Battle of Red May, so that the output of steel and steel products increased steadily. In the last five days of early May, steel increased by 9.06% and steel products increased by 45.82% compared to the first five days.
    Since May, the company has focused on improving the utilization coefficient of metallurgical equipment. First, it carried out technical transformation of the pig iron furnaces, changing the original hot-blast alkaline pig iron furnaces into new-type pig iron furnaces, ensuring the supply of molten iron to the converters and improving the output and quality of converter steel.
    In terms of open-hearth steelmaking, the workers broke through many key production issues, and the steel output in the last five days of early May increased by 36% compared to the first five days.
    
    Xinhua News Agency, Fuxin, 12th: Fuxin Coal Mine workers produced more than 133,000 tons of coal for the country in early May, and the average daily output increased by 4% compared to April. Open-pit stripping and mine tunneling also overfulfilled the state plan for early May.
    In May, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in various mines were closely integrated with current production and achieved new developments. The No. 99 Communist Youth League electric shovel of Haizhou Mine completed 91,000 cubic meters of stripping in early May due to the implementation of more than a dozen innovation proposals, creating the highest ten-day output record in history.
    
    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 12th: Kailuan Coal Mine workers overfulfilled the raw coal production plan for early May. In ten days, the entire mine produced an average of 2,642 tons of coal more per day than the average in late April, and tunneling also overfulfilled the footage plan for early May.
    More than 1,400 production teams in Kailuan Coal Mine formulated leap forward plans in the Great Battle of Red May and put forward specific and reliable measures. In the high-yield competition, 90% of the teams overfulfilled the leap forward plan.
    
    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 12th: Jiaozuo Mining Bureau workers fought hard in Red May and overfulfilled the raw coal production plan for the first ten days of the month by 17.53%. The average daily output increased by 16.19% compared with the previous month; during the same period, the entire mining bureau completed more than 4,190 meters of tunneling, and the daily progress increased by 2.54% compared with the plan.

    红五月里定要日日红旬旬红全月红
    鞍钢
    找出关键进行表演钢铁产量逐日提高
    据新华社鞍山12日电　鞍钢职工正在开展一次大联合技术表演竞赛周。从高炉到平炉，从矿山到轧钢机，竞赛高潮热浪滔滔。从8日开始的三天以来，钢、生铁、钢材、钢坯、焦炭产量逐日提高，其中生铁、钢材、钢坯分别比前七天的平均日产量提高3％到5％以上。
    在联合技术表演竞赛中，各厂矿都通过检查前一阶段生产情况，找出生产关键，展开了攻关表演。炼铁厂十号高炉职工在找出了放好渣、出好铁两大生产关键后，全炉推广了青年工人陈贵修创造的“勤放、勤堵”的新放渣经验，三天中比计划多产生铁一百五十吨。
    上钢
    狠抓推广先进经验质量提高铁耗下降
    据新华社上海12日电　上海钢铁工业战线职工5月份开展夺钢大战，取得了新的成果。到10日止，据市冶金局所属上钢一厂、上钢三厂、上钢五厂三个大厂的统计，转炉钢的一级品率达到87％，超过了4月份全局的平均水平；每吨钢的生铁消耗量普遍降低到一千三百公斤以下。
    上海各钢厂进入5月份后，各钢厂进一步抓紧技术改造，使已经行之有效的先进经验迅速在生产中开花结果，因此进一步缩短了冶炼时间和提高了钢的日产量。10日这一天，市冶金局系统的平炉钢产量，创造了今年以来日产量的最高纪录。
