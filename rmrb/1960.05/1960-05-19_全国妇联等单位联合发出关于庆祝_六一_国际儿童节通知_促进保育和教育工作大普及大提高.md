Xinhua News Agency, 18th. A joint notice on celebrating this year's "June 1st" International Children's Day issued by the All-China Women's Federation, All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China, National Committee of the China Association for Science and Technology, China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, National Committee for the Defence of Children of the Chinese People, Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, and Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China, is as follows:

This year's celebration of "June 1st" International Children's Day comes at a time when China's socialist construction is experiencing a sustained great leap forward and the people's communes in urban and rural areas are universally developing and continuously improving. Since 1958, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people, holding high the three red banners of the general line of socialist construction, the great leap forward, and the people's communes, have achieved unprecedentedly great victories on all fronts of socialist construction and socialist revolution. With the comprehensive great leap forward in China's socialist construction, a high tide of increasing and improving collective living welfare undertakings such as public canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens has been set off in both urban and rural areas. Primary schools run by the state and communes, as well as extracurricular children's education institutions, have developed accordingly, and childcare and education work has achieved unprecedented great achievements, entering a new historical stage. This is particularly evident in that preschool childcare work has become a large-scale social undertaking. Tens of millions of children have entered nursing rooms, nurseries, and kindergartens. Comprehensive organizations for preschool children's health and education, based on childcare organizations, are developing into networks, linking prenatal check-ups and education for pregnant women, maternal health care, infant rearing, and early childhood education, protecting the fetus and ensuring that children receive collective upbringing from an early age. In childcare organizations, children are provided with suitable diets according to their age development, good habits are cultivated, and they receive the knowledge they can accept, especially starting from an early age to receive socialist and communist education, so that children can develop more healthily in all aspects. This shows the superiority of social collective upbringing. The principle of giving priority to social education for preschool children has become increasingly popular.

The number of children entering primary school in 1959 reached more than 90 million, an increase of more than 20 million compared to 1957. This increase is equal to the total number of children enrolled in the highest year before liberation. The number of Young Pioneers has grown to 50 million, an increase of more than 20 million compared to 1957. State-run children's libraries, children's palaces, children's science and technology guidance stations, and mass-run extracurricular education institutions have been universally established, and a large number of children's publications have been published. It is particularly worth pointing out that the policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor has been universally implemented, and teaching reforms in middle and primary schools are being carried out on a large scale, and the remaining poison of bourgeois education thought is being further eliminated.

The ranks of children's workers have expanded significantly. The number of childcare and education workers in urban and rural nurseries and kindergartens has reached more than 6 million, and the number of primary school teachers, Young Pioneer instructors, children's medical and health workers, and cultural and art workers has also greatly increased. Their ideological awareness and professional level have been significantly improved, and the spirit of communist initiative, cooperation, and diligence in running undertakings has been greatly promoted. A huge team of children's workers who are both red and expert is being formed.

All this vividly shows that China's children's education work has embarked on a new stage. At the same time, we have not only achieved extremely significant achievements in the work of training communist successors, but also played an extremely significant role in more universally liberating women's labor force, more fully mobilizing the labor enthusiasm of parents, promoting the current vigorous technical innovation and technical revolution movement, more universally developing and continuously improving the people's communes in urban and rural areas, and improving the socialist and communist consciousness of the masses. It has also prepared the conditions for promoting teaching reforms in middle and primary schools. All this is the result of the great care given by the Party and the state to children's childcare and education work.

At present, the broad masses of the people urgently demand the universalization and improvement of preschool childcare work, demand further elimination of bourgeois ideas in children's childcare and education work, and demand actively and on a larger scale to try out teaching reforms. Therefore, when celebrating "June 1st" International Children's Day this year, the various levels of organizations of our several groups and departments should vigorously publicize the important significance of preschool children's education and upbringing to all aspects of society. Currently, family education is still necessary, but we should actively and gradually implement the principle of giving priority to social education, publicize the superiority of collective upbringing of children through practical examples, and encourage relevant aspects of society and the broad masses of the people to vigorously promote the more rapid development and improvement of childcare organizations. Vigorously training childcare workers is particularly urgent at present. We must implement the policy of walking on two legs, both actively developing normal schools for early childhood education and nursing schools, and at the same time holding a large number of short-term and spare-time training courses to actively train qualified kindergarten teachers and childcare workers. Gradually enable the education and upbringing of preschool children to be undertaken by more trained nurses and kindergarten teachers. In early childhood education and children's education in primary and secondary schools, we should continue to implement the policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor, further criticize bourgeois education thought, actively try out teaching reforms, and greatly improve the quality of education. We should also encourage children's workers to deeply recognize that children's work is a glorious and lofty work position, to love children more, strive to improve their communist ideology and professional level, further carry out teaching reforms and technical innovation and technical revolution movements in children's childcare work, exchange experiences in children's work, learn from each other, further widely and deeply carry out the learn from, compare with, catch up with, and help each other movement, continue to promote the universalization and improvement of children's childcare and education work, and promote the all-round development of children's moral, intellectual, and physical education. We should also properly arrange children's rest, care about their health, and conscientiously achieve a combination of work and rest, so that the vast number of children in our country can become three-good students with good health, good studies, and good work.

On the eve of this year's celebration of "June 1st" International Children's Day, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, the All-China Women's Federation, and the National Committee for the Defence of Children of the Chinese People have jointly decided to jointly award 10,000 advanced collectives and advanced children's workers (including advanced collectives in various aspects of children's work, advanced childcare workers, educators, primary school teachers, Young Pioneer instructors, medical staff related to children, exemplary cadres, teachers and students in normal schools for early childhood education and nursing schools, and advanced workers in children's literature, art, sports, and other aspects of children's work), and award them the honorary titles of "Advanced Children's Work Collective" and "Advanced Children's Worker." The conditions for advanced collectives and advanced workers are: (1) Red in thought, full of drive, and love for children's work; (2) In the position of children's work, can adhere to the principles of socialist and communist education, and diligently study and have innovative creations; (3) Strive to learn cultural theory and childcare scientific knowledge, and have significant achievements in improving the quality of work; (4) In children's work, be good at uniting the masses and promoting the communist spirit of cooperation. All those who have one of the above conditions and have made outstanding achievements in their work can be selected as advanced children's work collectives or advanced children's workers. The method of selection should be democratic and should be both careful and simple. Specific methods shall be decided by the organizations of our groups in provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, and by relevant units through consultation.

All localities should use various methods to conduct socialist and communist education for children, especially focusing on educating children about Chairman Mao's revolutionary struggle deeds, combining with current domestic and international events, and inspiring children to love the Party, love the leader, love the motherland, love socialism, love the people's communes, love the people, love labor, love science, and cherish public property through vivid and concrete examples. At the same time, children should understand the happy lives of children in socialist countries; understand the poor, painful, and uneducated miserable lives of workers' children in capitalist imperialist countries and children in colonial and semi-colonial countries; and make them understand that this is the result of the oppression, exploitation, and aggression of imperialism and colonialism against the working people and the people of colonial and semi-colonial countries; thereby cultivating their sympathy for the oppressed people and their sense of justice for the patriotic struggle of the oppressed nations. In particular, it is necessary to educate children to understand that US imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the people of the world and must be overthrown.

In order to facilitate children's workers, parents, and more children to participate in commemorative activities, all cities, counties, and grass-roots units (factories, mines, enterprises, people's communes, troops, streets, organs, childcare organizations, schools, etc.) can carry out commemorative activities, and specific methods can be stipulated by themselves. In principle, it should be both grand and save manpower. The arrangement of celebration activities for children themselves should be both enthusiastic and diverse, and should not make children tired. All regions and organizations with foreign children should invite them to participate in the commemorative activities together, so that all children can have a happier and more joyful holiday.

    全国妇联等单位联合发出关于庆祝“六一”国际儿童节通知
    促进保育和教育工作大普及大提高
    新华社18日讯　中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会、中华全国总工会、中国共产主义青年团中央委员会、中华人民共和国科学技术协会全国委员会、中国文学艺术界联合会、中国人民保卫儿童全国委员会、中华人民共和国教育部、中华人民共和国卫生部八个单位关于庆祝今年“六一”国际儿童节的联合通知，全文如下：
    今年庆祝“六一”国际儿童节，正处在我国社会主义建设持续大跃进和城乡人民公社普遍发展和不断提高的大好形势下。从1958年以来，我国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东主席领导下，高举社会主义建设总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗，在社会主义建设和社会主义革命的各个战线上取得了空前伟大的胜利。随着我国社会主义建设事业的全面大跃进，不论在城市或农村，都掀起了增办和提高公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园等集体生活福利事业的高潮。国家举办、公社举办的小学以及校外儿童教育机关都有了相应的发展，儿童保育和教育工作取得了从来未有的巨大成就，进入了新的历史阶段。特别明显地表现在：学龄前儿童保育工作已经成为大规模的社会事业。几千万儿童进了哺乳室、托儿所、幼儿园。以托儿组织为基础的学前儿童保健、教育的综合性组织，正在成网成套地发展起来，把孕妇的检查教育、产妇的保健、婴儿养育及幼儿教育连成一套，使胎儿得到了保护，使儿童从小受到集体的教养，在托儿组织里，根据儿童年龄的发展，供给适合的饮食，培养良好的习惯，得到他们可能接受的知识，特别是从小就开始受到社会主义、共产主义教育，使儿童的各方面得到比较健康的发展。这就显示了社会集体教养的优越性。对学龄前儿童也应以社会教育为主的方针，已经越来越深入人心。
    入小学的儿童，1959年已达九千多万人；比1957年增加二千多万人，这个增加的数字等于解放前全国入学儿童最高年份的总数。少年先锋队队员已发展到五千万人，比1957年也增加二千多万人。国家举办的少年图书馆、少年宫、少年科技指导站，以及群众举办的校外教育机构普遍设立，少年儿童读物大量出版。特别值得指出的是，教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，已经普遍贯彻实行，中、小学教学改革正在大规模地进行试验，资产阶级教育思想遗毒正在进一步被清除。
    儿童工作者的队伍显著扩大，城乡托儿所、幼儿园的保教人员已达六百多万人，小学教师、少先队辅导员，儿童医务、保健、文化艺术工作者等也大大增加；他们的思想觉悟和业务水平都有了显著的提高，共产主义首创精神、协作精神和勤俭办事业的作风大大发扬。正在形成一支巨大的又红又专的儿童工作者的队伍。
    这一切鲜明地表现了我国儿童教育工作已经走上了新阶段。同时我们不仅在培养共产主义接班人的工作方面，取得了极显著的成绩；而且对更普遍地解放妇女劳动力，更充分地发挥父母的劳动积极性，促进当前声势浩大的技术革新和技术革命运动；对更加普遍地发展和不断提高城乡人民公社；对提高人民群众的社会主义、共产主义觉悟，都起了极为显著的作用。也为促进中、小学的教学改革准备了条件。所有这一切都是党和国家对于儿童保育和教育工作，给予了极大关怀的结果。
    当前广大人民群众迫切要求学前儿童保育工作大普及和大提高，要求进一步清除儿童保育和教育工作中的资产阶级思想，要求积极地更大规模地试行教学改革。因此在今年庆祝“六一”国际儿童节的时候，我们几个团体、部门的各级组织，要大力向社会各方面宣传学前儿童教养工作的重要的意义。当前家庭教育仍然是必要的，但应积极地逐步地贯彻执行以社会教育为主的方针，通过实际的事例宣传集体教养儿童的优越性；鼓舞社会有关方面及广大人民群众大力促进托儿组织的更加迅速地发展和提高。而大力培训保教人员尤是当前的急务，要贯彻执行两条腿走路的方针，既应积极发展幼儿师范和保育护士学校，同时要大量举办短期和业余训练，积极培养合格的幼儿教师和保育人员。逐步使学前儿童的教养工作，能够有更多受过训练的保育护士和幼儿教师负担。在幼儿教育和中小学的儿童教育工作中，均应继续贯彻教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，进一步批判资产阶级教育思想，积极试行教学改革，大大提高教育的质量。我们还应鼓舞儿童工作者深刻认识儿童工作是一个光荣的、崇高的工作岗位，要更加热爱儿童，努力提高共产主义思想和业务水平，进一步开展儿童保教工作中的教学改革和技术革新、技术革命运动，交流儿童工作的经验，互相学习，进一步广泛深入地开展学、比、赶、帮运动，继续促进儿童保育和教育工作的大普及、大提高，促进儿童德育、智育、体育的全面发展。还要适当安排儿童的休息，关心他们的健康，认真作到劳逸结合，使我国广大儿童成为身体好，学习好，工作好的三好学生。
    在今年庆祝“六一”国际儿童节的前夕，全国总工会、共青团中央、全国妇联、中国人民保卫儿童全国委员会四个团体共同决定联名奖励一万名儿童工作先进集体和先进儿童工作者（包括各个方面儿童工作的先进集体，先进的保育员、教养员、小学教师、少先队辅导员，有关儿童的医护人员，在幼儿师范、保育护士学校的模范干部、教师和学生，以及儿童文学、艺术、体育和其他各方面做儿童工作的先进工作者），分别授予“先进儿童工作集体”、“先进儿童工作者”的奖状。先进集体和先进工作者的条件是：（1）思想红，干劲足，热爱儿童工作；（2）在儿童工作的岗位上，能坚持社会主义、共产主义教育原则，并刻苦钻研，有革新创造；（3）努力学习文化理论和保教科学知识，提高工作质量有显著成绩；（4）在儿童工作中善于团结群众，发扬共产主义协作精神。凡具有上述条件之一的，并在工作中做出突出成绩的，都可选为先进儿童工作集体或先进儿童工作者。产生的办法，应民主推选，以既慎重又简便为好。具体办法由我们各团体的省、市、自治区的组织及各有关单位协商决定。
    各地应运用各种方式，向儿童进行社会主义、共产主义教育，特别着重在儿童中进行毛主席革命斗争事迹的教育，结合当前国内外大事，通过生动具体的事例，启发儿童更加热爱党、热爱领袖、热爱祖国、热爱社会主义、热爱人民公社、热爱人民、热爱劳动、热爱科学和爱护公共财物。同时，使儿童了解社会主义国家的儿童的幸福生活；了解资本帝国主义国家的劳动者的儿童和殖民地半殖民地国家的儿童贫穷痛苦和失学的悲惨生活；并使他们懂得这是帝国主义、殖民主义对劳动人民、殖民地半殖民地人民的压迫、剥削和侵略的结果；从而培养他们对被压迫人民的同情心和对被压迫民族人民的爱国斗争的正义感。特别要教育儿童懂得美帝国主义是全世界人民最凶恶的敌人，必须打倒美帝国主义。
    为了便于儿童工作者、父母及更多的儿童能参加纪念活动，各城市、各县及各基层单位
  （各厂矿、企业、人民公社、部队、街道、机关、托儿组织、学校等）均可进行纪念活动，具体办法可各自规定。原则上既要有声势，又要节约人力。对儿童本身的庆祝活动的安排，既要热烈多样，又不要使儿童疲劳。凡有外国儿童所在的地区和组织，均应邀请他们共同参加纪念活动；使全体儿童都能在自己的节日过得更加快乐，更加高兴。
