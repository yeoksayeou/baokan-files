    Small Mines Competing with Large Mines
    Wang Pu
    "Set lofty aspirations, exert great efforts, compete with large mines!" What a resounding and heroic slogan. Under the encouragement of this slogan, the workers of Tongxing Coal Mine in Qijiang have created remarkable achievements. The average daily coal production per worker in the entire mine has leaped from below one ton before August of last year to over five tons in the first quarter of this year, and even exceeded eight tons in April. The cost per ton of coal has been reduced to 55 cents, indeed catching up with and even surpassing the level of some modern large mines.
    It is truly a miracle that a small mine with poor material and technical conditions can outperform large mines with much better conditions. Where does this miracle come from? The experience of Tongxing Coal Mine in Qijiang has a particularly valuable aspect, which is the combination of proactive, positive balancing thought and conscious, continuous revolution thought.
    Some enterprises also organize active balancing, but often they do so only to complete the planned tasks. When it is estimated that the state plan can be completed and overfulfilled, although there are contradictions between advanced and backward links in production, they do not immediately organize active balancing. In short, their organization of active balancing is not very conscious, giving people a feeling that they only move when pushed (referring to production tasks), and don't move unless pushed.
    Tongxing Coal Mine in Qijiang is different. They first concentrated their efforts on reforming coal mining methods and improving operating techniques. After the coal production increased rapidly, they found a new contradiction that underground transportation could not keep up with production. They immediately mobilized the masses to reform transportation tools and changed single-track roadways to double-track roadways. After the underground transportation was solved, the contradiction that ground transportation could not keep up with the needs emerged again. They immediately organized forces to rush-build light railways, changed small narrow wooden tracks to highways, and expanded transportation capacity. From this, we can see that they do not organize active balancing only when they fail to complete the planned tasks, but are guided by a highly conscious continuous revolution thought. As soon as an imbalance appears, they proactively organize active balancing, and constantly guide the masses towards new goals. In production, the situation of failing to complete planned tasks may not always exist, but the situation of production imbalance occurs frequently. Enterprise leaders who grasp this law, guided by continuous revolution thought, can proactively and timely organize active balancing, and timely improve the unsuitable parts of the production relations and the superstructure according to the new conditions, so that they adapt to the development of the productive forces and the economic base, and promote the leap-forward development of the productive forces.
    Tongxing Coal Mine in Qijiang is a "large-area, high-yield red flag" in China's coal industry. As stated in the approval comments of the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee on the experience of this mine: their experience is not only suitable for small coal mines, but also worthy of serious study by large and medium-sized coal mines and other industrial enterprises. Especially now, when a new high tide of production is rising with a focus on vigorously grasping coal, iron, ore and transportation, and vigorously making steel, it is even more meaningful to learn their ambition and drive to "compete with large mines," and to learn their conscious continuous revolution thought and proactive, positive balancing spirit.

### 小矿赛大矿

    小矿赛大矿
    王朴
    “立大志，鼓大劲，赛大矿！”多么响亮、多么豪迈的口号。綦江同兴煤矿的职工们在这个口号的鼓舞下，创造了很出色的成绩。全矿工人平均每人每日采煤量，由去年8月份以前的一吨以下飞跃到今年第一季度的五吨以上，4月份更超过了八吨，每吨煤的成本降到五角五分，果然赶上甚至超过了某些现代化大矿的水平。
    一个物质技术条件很差的小矿的生产水平赛过物质技术条件比它好得多的大矿，真是奇迹。奇迹从哪里来？綦江同兴煤矿的经验中，有一条特别宝贵，那就是主动的积极平衡思想和自觉的不断革命思想相结合。
    有些企业也组织积极的平衡，可是，往往是为了完成规定的计划任务才这样做。当估计国家计划能够完成和超额完成的时候，虽然生产中也存在着先进环节和落后环节的矛盾，他们却不立即组织积极的平衡。总之，他们组织积极的平衡不是很自觉的，多少给人有点逼（指生产任务）一逼动一动，不逼就不动的感觉。
    綦江同兴煤矿可不同。他们首先集中力量改革采煤方法，改进操作技术。采煤量迅速提高以后，他们发现井下运输赶不上生产的新矛盾，马上又发动群众，改革运输工具，改单轨巷道为双轨巷道。井下运输解决以后，地面运输跟不上需要的矛盾又冒出来，他们马上组织力量，突击修建轻便铁路，把小窄木轨道改为公路，扩大运输能力。从这里可以看到，他们并不是在完不成规定的计划任务的时候才组织积极的平衡，而是以高度自觉的不断革命思想作指导，一出现不平衡，就主动地组织积极的平衡，不停顿地引导群众奔向新的目标。在生产中，完不成计划任务的情况，不可能经常存在，但是生产不平衡的情况却经常出现。企业领导人员掌握了这个规律，以不断革命思想为指导，就能主动地及时地组织积极的平衡，并及时地根据新的条件改进生产关系、改进上层建筑的不合适部分，使它们跟生产力、经济基础的发展相适应，推动生产力的飞跃发展。
    綦江同兴煤矿是我国煤炭工业中的一面“大面积高产红旗”。像中共四川省委关于这个矿的经验的批语里所说的：他们的经验不仅适合于小煤窑，而且也值得大中型煤矿和其他工业企业认真学习。特别是现在，一个以大抓煤、铁、矿石和运输，大力炼钢为中心的生产新高潮正在兴起的时候，学习他们那种“赛大矿”的雄心大志和干劲，学习他们那种自觉的不断革命思想和主动的积极平衡精神，就更有意义。
