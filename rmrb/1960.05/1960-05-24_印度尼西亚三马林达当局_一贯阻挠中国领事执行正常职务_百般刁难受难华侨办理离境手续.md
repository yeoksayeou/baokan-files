Xinhua News Agency, 23rd dispatch from Jakarta: Prior to the incident on April 27th, when the Indonesian Samarinda military authorities forcibly placed the Chinese Consul in Ma-ch'en, Jiang Yan, under house arrest, the Samarinda military and procuratorial authorities had been obstructing Chinese consuls from performing their normal duties for some time, and were making things difficult for Overseas Chinese wishing to return to China.

As early as March this year, when Consul Jiang Yan traveled from Ma-ch'en to East Kalimantan, the Kalimantan Inter-Regional Liaison Command repeatedly obstructed him. The Liaison Command once used the excuse that "consular inspections must be approved by the Indonesian Republic's Ministry of Foreign Affairs" to obstruct the Chinese consul from performing his normal duties. However, the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs had already notified that consuls do not need to obtain the consent of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to travel within their consular district.

When Consul Jiang Yan arrived in Balikpapan on March 11th, the local military authorities, after failing in their conspiracy to threaten and obstruct Consul Jiang Yan from going to Samarinda, immediately made an unreasonable request that he not meet with more than five Overseas Chinese there, and ordered him to return to Balikpapan before the 14th.

In order to assist in the repatriation of displaced and impoverished Overseas Chinese, Consul Jiang Yan traveled back and forth between Balikpapan and Samarinda several times. However, the local military authorities did not arrange accommodation for him on three occasions. When he stayed in the homes of Overseas Chinese, they sent armed personnel to monitor him. On several occasions, soldiers even broke directly into Consul Jiang Yan's residence to drive away Overseas Chinese who were meeting with the consul.

Despite the local military and procuratorial authorities' obstruction of Consul Jiang Yan in every possible way, Consul Jiang Yan had been fully cooperating with the relevant local authorities in a friendly manner while performing his duties. For example, in Samarinda, when handling the departure procedures for the first group of distressed Overseas Chinese on the "Fu'an" ship, the distressed Overseas Chinese expressed legitimate dissatisfaction with the unreasonable departure procedures. Despite this, Consul Jiang Yan still persuaded the Overseas Chinese to complete the procedures in accordance with the Indonesian authorities' "regulations." When the Indonesian local authorities emphasized that there were no ships and could not go to Wu-lao Tanjung and other places to pick up the Overseas Chinese who had been forced to relocate to Samarinda for concentration, Consul Jiang Yan tried to mobilize local Overseas Chinese ships to solve this difficulty.

This series of facts shows that the incident in which the Samarinda military authorities forcibly placed the Chinese consul under house arrest was by no means accidental. However, Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Suwito's statement on May 14th insisted that the Samarinda military authorities had to "take such security measures" against Consul Jiang Yan because Consul Jiang Yan had "insulted" Indonesian officials, and based on this fabricated lie, described the act of placing the Chinese consul under house arrest as an attempt to "calm the atmosphere."

While the Indonesian Army authorities took various restrictive measures against Consul Jiang Yan, the Samarinda Procuratorate made all kinds of difficulties for the work of China repatriating distressed Overseas Chinese. For example, in the Overseas Chinese departure procedures, initially every Overseas Chinese person over the age of sixteen had to complete seven types of forms, submit thirty photos, take one hundred and sixty fingerprints, and also conduct individual "interrogations" of the Overseas Chinese behind closed doors. The local procuratorial official, Mahar, even molested and insulted Overseas Chinese women under the pretext of "handling procedures." In the Chinese school in Samarinda, Mahar "interrogated" two young Overseas Chinese women from Wu-lao Coal Mine behind closed doors, and molested them, saying, "Stay and marry us." The authorities also used "personal inspections" as an excuse to lock up Overseas Chinese in newly built houses like small wooden cages for livestock, ordering them to take off their clothes for "full body checks." When checking luggage, the inspectors deliberately made things difficult, cutting the soap open with knives, disassembling bicycles, and pouring out all the cocoa powder to rub it with their hands. Even if a kapok seed was found in the mattress, the entire mattress would be cut open. These extremely unreasonable measures taken by the relevant Indonesian authorities, which deliberately made things difficult and obstructed the Overseas Chinese, have aroused great indignation among the Overseas Chinese.

    印度尼西亚三马林达当局
    一贯阻挠中国领事执行正常职务
    百般刁难受难华侨办理离境手续
    新华社23日讯　雅加达消息：在4月27日印度尼西亚三马林达军事当局强行软禁中国驻马辰领事江燕事件发生以前的一个时期内，三马林达军事当局和检察当局一直在阻挠中国领事执行正常职务，百般刁难希望回国的华侨。
    早在今年3月间，江燕领事自马辰前往东加里曼丹时，加里曼丹区际联络司令部屡次加以阻难。联络司令部曾经以“领事出巡须经印度尼西亚共和国外交部的准许”为借口，阻挠中国领事执行正常职务。但是，印度尼西亚外交部早已通知过，领事在其领区内出巡无需得到外交部的同意。
    当江燕领事在3月11日到达巴里巴板时，当地军方在威胁阻挠江燕领事去三马林达的阴谋失败后，就立即向江燕领事提出不得在那里接见五名以上华侨的无理要求，并且限令他在14日前必须返回巴里巴板。
    为了协助遣返流离失所和贫困的华侨，江燕领事曾数度奔走于巴里巴板和三马林达之间。但是当地军方有三次不给他安排住宿。当他在华侨家中住下时，又派武装人员监视，有几次军人竟然直接闯进江燕领事的住所，驱赶在那里会见领事的华侨。
    尽管当地军事和检察当局对江燕领事百般阻难，江燕领事在执行职务期间一直以友好态度同当地有关当局进行充分的合作。如在三马林达，在办理第一批乘“福安号”的难侨的离境手续时，难侨对办理离境的不合理手续表示正当的不满，尽管如此，江燕领事仍然说服华侨遵照印度尼西亚当局的“规定”办完手续；在印度尼西亚地方当局强调没有船只，不能去巫劳丹绒等地接运遭到逼迁的华侨到三马林达集中时，江燕领事就设法动员当地华侨船只，解决这一困难。
    这一系列事实说明三马林达军事当局强行软禁中国领事事件绝不是偶然的。但是，印度尼西亚外交部发言人苏维托5月14日发表的谈话却硬说，三马林达军事当局所以要对江燕领事“采取这种安全措施”，是由于江燕领事“侮辱”了印度尼西亚的官员，并且从这个捏造的谎言出发，而把软禁中国领事的行为说成是为了“平息气氛”。
    在印度尼西亚陆军当局对江燕领事采取种种限制的同时，三马林达的检察署对中国遣返难侨的工作进行了种种刁难。如在华侨离境手续上，起初要每一个年满十六岁的华侨办理七种表格、缴三十张照片、打一百六十个指印，还要关着门对华侨进行个别“讯问”。当地检察官员马哈尔还竟以“办理手续”为名调戏侮辱华侨妇女。马哈尔在三马林达的中华学校里，闭门“讯问”从巫劳炭山来的两个华侨女青年，并且调戏她们说，“留下来和我们结婚吧”。当局还借“人身检查”为名把华侨关到临时造好的像圈牲口的小木笼一样的房子里，要他们脱去衣服，进行“全身检查”。在检查行李时，检查人员故意刁难，把肥皂用刀切开，把自行车拆卸开，把可可粉全倒出来用手搓捻。甚至在褥垫里摸到一粒木棉籽，就把整个褥子剪开。印度尼西亚有关当局这些有意刁难、阻难华侨的极不合理的措施，已经引起华侨极大的愤慨。
