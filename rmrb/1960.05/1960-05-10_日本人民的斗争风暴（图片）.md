The Storm of Struggle of the Japanese People
    On April 26th, the Japanese people launched a massive movement against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, sending 15,000 representatives from all over the country to petition the Diet. The picture shows a part of the delegation. The signs read "Oppose the Security Treaty! Down with the Kishi Government! Dissolve the Diet!"
    Workers delivered their petitions against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty to the Japanese Communist Party Diet members. In the picture, the person in the center is Japanese Communist Party leader Sanzo Nosaka.
    On April 24th, under the call of the Japanese Communist Party, 4,000 people came to the Diet to express their determination to oppose the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."
    The Japanese reactionaries carried out bloody suppression of the Japanese people's legitimate patriotic actions. The picture shows the police brutally attacking the student demonstrators on April 26th.
    Japanese monks also joined the ranks of the patriotic and righteous struggle. On April 26th, monks demonstrated in front of the Diet. The signs read: "We support those who are fasting for peace, we oppose the revision of the Security Treaty."
