Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 24th: The laboring people of Jakarta held a grand rally on the evening of the 23rd to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the Indonesian Communist Party, which enjoys the highest prestige among the Indonesian people.

The atmosphere inside and outside the venue was filled with enthusiasm. Attending the conference were labor representatives, activists from the party and mass organizations numbering in the thousands, as well as prominent Indonesian scholars, artists, and leaders from other political parties and mass organizations. Suwirjo and Ali from the Indonesian Nationalist Party, Arifin from the Islamic Teachers Association, Abbas from the Perti Islamic Party, and Xiao Yu Can from the National Consultative Assembly all attended to express their congratulations.

The Mayor and Deputy Mayor of Jakarta, several former cabinet ministers and deputy ministers also attended the conference. Many workers and students stood outside the venue, cheering and welcoming the leaders of the Indonesian Communist Party and other guests as they entered. Diplomatic envoys from the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries stationed in Indonesia also attended the conference.

The leaders of the Indonesian Communist Party, including Aidit, Lukman, Njoto, and Sudisman, sat on the stage, which was adorned with flowers presented by people from all walks of life.

At the beginning of the conference, several hundred children wearing red scarves—members of the Indonesian Communist Party-led children's organization "Dawn of Hope"—went on stage to present flowers to the party leaders, recite poems, and sing songs, enthusiastically praising the Indonesian Communist Party.

The chairman of the conference then read out congratulatory messages from fraternal parties in twenty-five countries, including the Soviet Union and China, amidst warm applause. The conference also read out congratulatory messages and letters from laboring people and social organizations from all over Indonesia. These congratulatory messages and letters expressed fervent hope and deep trust in the Indonesian Communist Party.

The Chairman of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party, Aidit, delivered a long speech at the conference entitled "Basic Conclusions on the Indonesian Communist Party's Struggle for National Independence and Peace." In his speech, Aidit summarized the basic experiences gained in the struggles of the Indonesian Communist Party over the past forty years since its founding, and criticized the deceptive talk of so-called "Indonesian-style socialism" currently popular in Indonesia. Aidit also spoke about the current political situation in Indonesia, exposed the anti-communist and anti-democratic nature of the "Democratic League," and pointed out that the policies of this organization were in line with the policies of American and Dutch imperialism.

Aidit also criticized the conspiracy of certain political adventurers to abolish existing political parties in Indonesia.
