Actively Develop Livestock, Vigorously Promote Feed Production
Jilin Province's Large-Scale Operation of "Three Farms" Leads to Rapid Livestock Development; Hunan Province Mobilizes All Sectors' Enthusiasm for Pig Raising;
Ningxia Constructs Feed Bases and Renews and Cultivates Grasslands; Wusheng County Utilizes Spring Crop By-products as Feed

(This report) Our newspaper reports that livestock production in Jilin Province is developing at a high speed. Not only is the quantity increasing rapidly, but the quality is also constantly improving. Last year, the number of large livestock in Jilin Province increased by 7.4% compared to 1958; as of mid-April this year, the province has already produced more than 48,000 foals, calves, and donkey and mule offspring, an increase of 135.6% over the same period last year. Improved livestock accounted for 44% of the newborn offspring.

One of the important methods for achieving high-speed development of large livestock in Jilin Province is the establishment of livestock "three farms" at all levels—prefecture, county, commune, and production team—including breeding farms, maternal animal breeding farms, and young animal rearing farms. A large professional team has been established for livestock breeding, pregnancy maintenance, delivery, grazing, feeding, disease prevention, and feed planting. This has gradually changed the subsidiary position of livestock production and begun to move towards a path where animal husbandry and crop cultivation are equally emphasized, continuously improving the level of scientific management, thereby ensuring the continuous leap forward in livestock production.

Operating livestock "three farms" on a large scale can not only give full play to the role of excellent breeding stock, but also increase the pregnancy rate of maternal animals; it can not only accelerate the improvement of livestock quality, but also improve the survival rate of young animals. Furthermore, under the current conditions of insufficient excellent breeding stock, it can achieve self-breeding and self-rearing, continuously increasing the subsequent breeding stock of excellent varieties suitable for local natural conditions. In recent years, various parts of the province have used a small number of breeding stock imported from other places to breed more than 50,000 improved breeding horses and breeding cattle. Due to the large increase in excellent breeding sires, more than 3,800 breeding stations and artificial insemination points have been established throughout the province, forming a densely distributed breeding network with interconnected stations and points. More than 80% of the maternal animals bred in the province have been bred with improved breeding stock. This spring, due to the centralized management of maternal animals, it is also convenient to do a good job in pregnancy maintenance. Thanks to the establishment of young animal rearing farms, scientific feeding and breeding are adopted for young animals, thereby enabling them to grow strong and greatly reducing their mortality.

Because operating livestock "three farms" on a large scale concentrates livestock operations, it is convenient to rationally utilize grasslands and water sources, to achieve mechanization and semi-mechanization in feeding management, and to improve the level of scientific management and strengthen livestock disease prevention. In the past, livestock epidemics would occur on the grasslands of the Baicheng area every spring, but now the occurrence of various epidemics has been basically controlled, reducing the livestock mortality rate to about 1% this spring.

(This report) Our newspaper reports that Hunan Province is fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of all sectors for pig raising in pig production, ensuring the high-speed development of pig raising throughout the province. The number of pigs in stock at the end of 1959 increased by 9.5% compared to 1958; in January and February of this year, the province increased by another 170,000 head compared to the end of December last year, and the number of pigs in stock increased by 34.3% compared to the same period last year.

The main tasks for achieving the high-speed development of pig raising in Hunan Province are: First, vigorously build collective pig farms. To date, there are 200,000 collective pig farms in the province. Second, vigorously promote feed production. Currently, 4 million mu of land has been planted with feed crops throughout the province. While vigorously promoting feed land, the masses in various places have also stored more than 27 billion jin of silage feed and concentrated feed. Third, raise more sows and strengthen breeding work. From October last year to February this year, the number of sows in the province doubled, increasing from 2.1 million to 4.3 million. Currently, all sows that should be bred in the province have been bred. Fourth, strengthen leadership. Party committees at all levels have designated special personnel to lead pig production, rectified the ranks of feeders, and strengthened epidemic prevention work.

While vigorously promoting collective pig raising by communes and production teams, the Provincial Party Committee has also closely focused on pig raising in rural public canteens. Developing canteen pig raising can make full use of rice soup, swill, vegetable leaves, and rice processing bran as feed, and can also use part of the auxiliary labor force to feed pigs. In 1959, the more than 400,000 rural public canteens in the province raised pigs accounting for 38% of the total number of pigs in the province.

(This report) Our newspaper reports that in order to adapt to the requirements of the high-speed development of livestock production, the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has recently been vigorously carrying out the construction of feed and fodder bases, while carrying out grassland renewal and cultivation work. In order to ensure that each large livestock has an average of half a mu of feed and fodder base and each sheep has two fen of feed and fodder base, various places have recently decided to double the area planted with various feed and fodder crops compared to last year. This year, the fallow land, which used to account for one-third of the cultivated land in the mountainous counties in the southern region, will also be used to plant feed crops. In some arid and water-deficient grasslands, people are effectively solving the difficulties of drinking water for humans and livestock by combining the construction of large reservoirs with small-scale water conservancy projects, and expanding the area of grassland irrigation.

In terms of grassland infrastructure construction, the three semi-mechanized grassland base work stations newly established in the autonomous region plan to reclaim 27,000 mu of land this year as a base for planting excellent pasture grasses, and also plan to replant wild grasses on pastures with poor pasture growth.

(This report) Our newspaper reports that Wusheng County, Sichuan Province, is seizing the opportunity during the spring harvest season to fully utilize the spring crop by-products that can be used as pig feed, preparing sufficient feed for the great development of pigs.

According to preliminary calculations, if all the stalks, branches, pods, leaves, and wheat husks of the county's 250,000 mu of spring crops such as peas, broad beans, and rapeseed are fully utilized, there will be a total of more than 62 million jin of fine and coarse dry feed, which can supply the county's existing 425,000 pigs for more than two months. It can be seen that fully utilizing agricultural crop by-products is an extremely important method for tapping the potential of feed production. The county party committee adopted four methods to ensure that all spring crop by-products are fully utilized.

First, widely publicize the benefits of using spring crop by-products as feed to cadres and the masses, overcome the erroneous ideas of underestimating by-products and thinking that collecting by-products is too troublesome, so that everyone cherishes all by-products and ensures that no branch, pod, or leaf is wasted.

Second, estimate the yield piece by piece in the fields before harvest, and according to the amount of by-products, the production team arranges the processing and storage locations and prepares for various treatment of by-products.

Third, establish a responsibility system with dedicated personnel in charge. Party committees at all levels are responsible for this work by the secretary in charge of pigs. Each production team designates special personnel to manage, and the work groups contract out by sections, combining the collection, storage, beating, and drying of spring crops to harvest by-products well.

Fourth, make full use of various processing forces to do a good job in feed processing. First, organize work groups to combine with the collection and beating of spring crops, adopt a one-time cleaning method, contract out the preliminary processing of by-products, and separate the stalks and branches of pea and broad bean coarse feed from the leaves and pod fine bran; then, professional personnel such as feeders and feed planters use various processing tools according to coarse and fine by-products, and organize and mobilize commune members to use small mills and small grinders to further process. In this way, all by-products can be made into various fine and coarse feeds, without affecting the rush to harvest and plant. (Attached picture)

    积极发展家畜　大抓饲料生产
    吉林省大办“三场”牲畜发展极快　湖南省调动各方面养猪积极性
    宁夏建设饲料基地更新培育草原　武胜县利用小春副产物作饲料
    本报讯　吉林省畜牧业生产高速度发展。不仅数量增加快，质量也不断提高。去年，吉林省大家畜比1958年净增7.4％；今年截至4月中旬，全省已接下马驹、牛犊和驴骡仔畜达四万八千多头，比去年同期增加135.6％，新生的仔畜中改良畜占44％。
    吉林省的大牲畜所以获得高速度的发展，重要办法之一，是几年来从专区、县、公社和生产队，各级普遍建立了牲畜“三场”——种畜繁育场、母畜繁殖场和幼驹培育场，在牲畜的配种、保胎、接产、放牧、饲养、疫病防治和饲料种植等方面，已建立起一支庞大的专业队伍，这就逐渐地改变了畜牧业生产的副业地位，开始走上畜牧业与种植业并重的道路，使科学管理水平不断提高，从而保证了畜牧业生产持续跃进。
    大办畜牧“三场”，既能发挥优良种畜的作用，又能提高母畜怀胎率；既能加速改良牲畜品质，又能提高幼驹成活率；并能在当前优良种畜不足的条件下，作到自繁、自育，不断增加适合当地自然条件的优良品种的后续种畜。几年来，全省各地已用外地引进的少量种畜繁育出五万多头改良种马和种牛。由于优良种公畜的大量增加，全省已建立起配种站和输精点三千八百多处，形成一个星罗棋布的站站相通，点点相连的配种网。全省已配种的母畜，用改良种畜配种的占80％以上。今年春季由于母畜集中管理，也便于作好保胎工作。由于建立起幼驹培育场，对幼驹采取科学饲养培育，从而使幼驹健壮的成长和大大的减少了幼驹的死亡。
    由于大办畜牧“三场”，把牲畜集中经营起来，就便于合理利用草原、水源，便于在饲养管理上实现机械化、半机械化；也便于提高科学管理水平和加强牲畜疫病防治。过去在白城地区草原上每到春季，就要发生畜疫，现在基本控制住了各种疫病的发生，使今春牲畜死亡率降到1％左右。
    本报讯　湖南省在养猪生产中充分调动各方面养猪的积极因素，保证了全省养猪高速度发展。1959年年底存栏数比1958年增长了9.5％；今年1至2月份全省又比去年12月底净增了十七万头，存栏量比去年同期增长34.3％。
    湖南省养猪事业所以获得高速度发展，主要抓了这几项工作：第一，大建集体养猪场。到目前止，全省共有集体养猪场二十万个。第二，大抓饲料。目前全省已种上了饲料四百万亩。在大抓饲料地的同时，各地群众又贮备了二百七十多亿斤青贮饲料和精饲料。第三，多养母猪和加强配种工作。从去年10月到今年2月，全省母猪发展了一倍，由二百一十万头增加到四百三十万头。目前，全省应配种的母猪都配上了种。第四，加强领导。各级党委确定了专人领导养猪生产。整顿了饲养员队伍，加强了防疫工作。
    在大抓社、队集体养猪的同时，省委又紧紧地抓住了农村公共食堂的养猪工作。发展食堂养猪可以充分利用米汤、潲水、菜叶、食米加工的糠作饲料，并可利用一部分辅助劳动力喂猪。全省四十多万个农村公共食堂1959年养猪达到全省养猪总数的38％。
    本报讯　宁夏回族自治区为了适应畜牧业生产高速度发展的要求，最近一面大力进行饲草、饲料的基地建设，一面开展草原更新培育工作。各地为了使每头大家畜平均有半亩、每只羊有二分地的饲草饲料基地，最近已决定把种植各种饲草饲料的面积比去年扩大一倍。南部山区各县过去占耕地三分之一的歇闲地，今年也将普遍利用种饲料。在一些干旱缺水的草原上，人们以建设大型水库与小型水利工程相结合的办法，有效地解决人畜饮水的困难，扩大了草原灌溉的面积。
    在草原基本建设方面，自治区新建立的三个半机械化草原基地工作站，今年除计划开荒二万七千亩地作为种植优良牧草的基地外，还计划在牧草生长较差的草场上补植野草。　　　　　　　　　　（李鹏歧）
    本报讯　四川省武胜县，抓紧在小春收获时期，把能够作猪饲料的小春副产物全部利用起来，为猪只大发展准备好充足的饲料。
    据初步计算，如果把全县二十五万多亩豌豆、胡豆、油菜等小春作物的秆枝、荚、叶和小麦壳等全部利用起来，共有精、粗干饲料六千二百多万斤，可以供给全县现有四十二万五千多头猪吃两月以上。可见，充分利用农作物的副产品，是挖掘饲料生产潜力的一个极其重要的办法。县委采取了四条办法，保证把小春副产物全部利用起来。
    第一，向干部和群众广泛宣传利用小春副产物作饲料的好处，克服轻视副产物和认为收集副产物太麻烦的错误思想，使每一个人都珍惜所有的副产物，做到不浪费一枝、一荚、一叶。
    第二，收获前在田间逐块估产量，根据副产物产量多少，由生产队安排好加工储藏地址，作好各项处理副产物的准备工作。
    第三，建立责任制度，专人包干管理。各级党委都由管猪只的书记负责这项工作。各生产队确定专人保管，作业组分片包干，结合小春的收、藏、打、晒，收获好副产物。
    第四，充分运用各种加工力量，做好饲料加工。首先，组织作业组结合收打小春作物，采取一道清的办法，包干副产物的初步加工，做到豌豆胡豆的秆、枝粗料与叶、荚细糠分开；再由饲养员、饲料种植员等专业人员按照粗、细副产物，利用各种加工工具，并且组织和发动社员利用小碾小磨，进一步加工。这样，既能把副产物全部制成各种精、粗饲料，又不影响抢收抢种。（附图片）
