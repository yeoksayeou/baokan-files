Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd dispatch: The National Council Against Revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" in Japan decided today to launch a signature campaign on May 7th demanding the dissolution of the Diet and a vote of no confidence in the Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet.

　　This signature campaign will be an important part of the 16th National United Action against the ratification of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," scheduled to begin on May 9th.

　　At the same time, the various member organizations of the National Council Against Revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" are actively preparing to hold the 16th United Action against the ratification of the new "Security Treaty."

　　The Socialist Party has already printed three million signature sheets, which have been distributed to its local organizations throughout the country.

　　Secretary-General Eda Saburo of the Socialist Party announced on April 30th that the Socialist Party will mobilize 200,000 people in Tokyo to petition the Diet against the ratification of the new "Security Treaty" when the Kishi Nobusuke group attempts to force the Diet to end discussions on the new "Security Treaty" from May 10th to 15th. At the same time, Yamamoto Koichi, chairman of the Socialist Party's Diet Policy Committee, said today that the Socialist Party will submit a motion of no confidence in the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet and a proposal to dissolve the Diet at an appropriate time. He also stated that if the ruling party forcibly ends the discussion on the new "Security Treaty," the Socialist Party will resist.

　　The National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations has begun preparing to organize a series of car demonstrations, which will be held in Tokyo on May 11th or 12th. More than fifty cars will participate in the demonstration. This car demonstration will publicize the necessity of restoring diplomatic and trade relations with China and call on the people to take action against the ratification of the new "Security Treaty."

　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd dispatch: The Japanese Communist Party's newspaper "Akahata" published an editorial today, calling on all party members and the Japanese people to unleash a climax of struggle in May to prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty."

　　The editorial said that the policy recently decided by the National Council Against Revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" stipulates that in May, the forces of all the Japanese people will be concentrated to launch a powerful struggle to prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty," demand the dissolution of the Diet, and overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet. The editorial said that this "May Struggle" officially began yesterday with the largest "May Day" Labor Day celebration in Japan since the war. We must muster courage and firm confidence to strive for the victory of the "May Struggle."

　　"Akahata" condemned the Kishi Nobusuke government and the Liberal Democratic Party for relying on its majority seats in the Diet to undermine Diet democracy and for plotting to force the Diet to pass the new "Security Treaty" before U.S. President Eisenhower's visit to Japan.

　　The editorial also exposed that the Kishi Nobusuke government and the Liberal Democratic Party are attempting to revise the "Criminal Law" and the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law" as well as labor laws, preparing to rebuild Japan into a police state.

　　"Akahata" emphasized that Syngman Rhee finally collapsed in the face of the Korean people's raging anger. The South Korean people's struggle tells us that Syngman Rhee's today is Nobusuke Kishi's tomorrow.

　　"Akahata" also emphasized that in the current situation, in order to develop the struggle to prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty," it is necessary to simultaneously launch a large-scale movement demanding the dissolution of the Diet and the overthrow of the Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet, and it is necessary to strive to collect 10 million signatures to petition the Diet and 3 million signatures to protest against the Kishi Nobusuke government and the U.S. government.

　　"Akahata" called for organizing a wider range of masses to participate in the struggle to prevent the Diet from ratifying the new "Security Treaty," and called for organizing more workers to hold strikes in May. (Attached photo)
