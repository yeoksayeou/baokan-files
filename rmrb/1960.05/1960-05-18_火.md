Fire
Zhou Hongzhu

A head full of fire, the American devils are panicking! Syngman Rhee is finished, Nobusuke Kishi is shaking, Chiang Kai-shek is collapsing, Ngo Dinh Diem is anxious, Turkey's angry tides are rolling, Cuba's fists are like steel, Africa's black giants are rising, Latin America is closely following. The power of the people is like the Pacific Ocean, rolling up monstrous waves, devouring the American devils' shrimp soldiers and crab generals! Colonialism is withering and decaying, aggression against others leads to self-destruction. Gentlemen in the White House, the Cold War cannot extinguish the lava from the volcano!

    火
    周鸿铸满头大火，美国佬发慌！李承晚完蛋，岸信介摇晃，蒋介石倒台，吴庭艳着忙，土耳其怒涛滚滚，古巴的拳头似钢，非洲站起黑色巨人，拉丁美洲紧紧跟上。人民的力量，就像太平洋，卷起滚滚巨浪，吞噬美国佬的虾兵蟹将！殖民主义摧枯拉朽，侵略别人自取灭亡。白宫里的先生们，冷战浇不熄火山口的岩浆！
