Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 17th: According to a broadcast by the Mokpo Radio Station in South Korea, more than 500 dockworkers in Mokpo Port, after struggling, forced the capitalists to pay all the wages they had been in arrears. It is reported that on May 10th, more than 500 workers went to the "Mokpo Branch of Korea Transportation Company," condemned the capitalists' exploitation of workers, and resolutely demanded immediate payment of more than 10 million won in arrears of wages. The capitalists attempted to continue to delay the workers' wages, using the excuse that "there is no cash available, let's talk about it in a few days." The workers launched a sit-in demonstration, and finally, the capitalists had to pay all the arrears of wages to the workers.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 17th: Seoul Dispatch: Several student demonstrations and worker strikes have occurred again in Seoul and other places in South Korea.

More than 30 students from the Faculty of Law of Seoul National University went to the home of Oh Wi-young, a pseudo-"National Assembly" member of the Democratic Party, on the 17th to hold a sit-in demonstration to protest his violence in detaining and beating students.

According to South Korean news agencies, on the evening of the 15th, two university students were passing by Oh Wi-young's house and said to each other, "If the Democratic Party also implements high-pressure politics like the Liberal Party, it should be condemned by the people." After Oh Wi-young overheard this, he actually ordered his henchmen to seize the two students, beat them severely, and detain them in his own home.

Upon hearing this news, the university students angrily ran to Oh Wi-young's home to protest and held a sit-in demonstration. They condemned Oh Wi-young, saying, "Democratic Party members also arbitrarily beat and detain people. What difference is there between this world and the rule of Syngman Rhee's Liberal Party!"

It is reported that students at the Seoul University of Foreign Studies held a strike on the afternoon of the 17th, demanding that the president of the university resign immediately.

On the same day, all the students of a middle school in Mokpo took to the streets to hold a demonstration, demanding that those teachers who oppressed students and supported the Syngman Rhee clique resign immediately.

In Busan, taxi and bus drivers went on strike, demanding increased wages and one day off per week.
