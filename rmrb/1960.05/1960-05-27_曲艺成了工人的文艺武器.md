	Folk Arts Became Workers' Literary Weapon
	Tao Dun
	Of all the programs in the National Workers' Literary and Art Performance, folk arts account for eighty-six, with almost every province and city having several folk art programs. We observed these programs and received great inspiration and education, learning many things. Based on the incomplete materials we have seen, let us talk about our understanding and experience:

	The folk art programs in the performance, like other forms of literary and art programs, closely cooperate with political movements and vigorously serve production. While some professional literary and art workers are still clamoring or doubting that cooperating with movements and serving production cannot produce highly artistic works, our workers have answered them with their own works and performances. For example, technical innovation and technical revolution are the current great movements, and the people of the whole country are exerting their soaring energy of painstaking research for technical innovation and technical revolution. In this workers' literary and art performance, there are seventy-eight programs reflecting the technical revolution. Folk arts account for a considerable number of these. Workers are working day and night in factories to carry out the technical revolution, writing about what they do, and works reflecting the current great movement have emerged. Their creation and performance, on the one hand, is for entertainment, and more importantly, for propaganda and education, to improve production and accelerate the socialist construction of the motherland, so they can grasp the important link in reality.

	Judging from the actors participating in the performance, their artistic talents are also surprising to the audience. Many of these actors are production experts and advanced producers. For example, Han Zhiren, the performer of Shandong Quick Talk "Beating the Running Dog," is an advanced producer. The audience believes that this young actor has talent; his talent is not only reflected in folk art performance, but also in production. Other actors in music, dance creation and performance have many advanced producers. This shows that physical labor and literary and artistic activities are not separated to be done well; on the contrary, they are better combined. They themselves are laborers, and what they perform is what they themselves labor at. What they say are the words refined from labor; their performance movements are the movements developed from labor. So it makes the audience look real and kind, without any traces of falsehood.

	The worker masses have mastered the form of folk arts, and when using it, they have developed and created many forms of folk arts according to actual needs. The "Ode to the Great Hall of the People" performed by the Beijing delegation can be taken as an example. The Great Hall of the People is the most magnificent building in the capital, completed in ten months to welcome the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, and it is a symbol of the Great Leap Forward. How inappropriate it would be to sing praises with a simple "Pai Zi Qu"! The workers absorbed the experience of the "Ode to the Monument to the People's Heroes" and the "Three Cheers," these several linked songs, and created the "Ode to the Great Hall of the People," a linked "Pai Zi Qu." There are new creations in music arrangement and performance form. Actors singing various folk arts sing together in a linked song, and the tones cannot be completely coordinated; but the tones of the "Ode to the Great Hall of the People," because of unified study and unified rehearsal, have a brand-new linked song. Here, let's take "Tianjin Kuaiban" as an example: this song form was recently created; Wang Jiajun, a dyeing and weaving worker, heard a "Yuanyang Tune" counting board at the labor site of digging the Haihe River, and he modified and supplemented it into "Tianjin Kuaiban," which is flexible in form, easy to change, in line with the nature of language, and can sing praises and also satirize. After the performance, it immediately became popular in Tianjin.

	There are also many creations in the performance art of folk arts. The most difficult problem for professional folk art workers to perform works with the life of workers, peasants and soldiers as the content is that they are not familiar with the life of workers, peasants and soldiers. It is incompatible to describe new things with old performance routines. How can workers themselves perform their own daily labor life, express the deeds of their partners or themselves and not be experts? Their performance is refined based on actual labor, and the movements are powerful and the postures are beautiful. In the long-term labor process, workers have developed labor movements into the most labor-saving and convenient, and they have also become the most beautiful forms; how can people who do not labor imitate them? The characters they express are around them, and their words and deeds have been heard and seen for a long time, so how can they not be alike? They don't need to experience the feelings of the workers, it is enough to express their own feelings. For example, Xue Chuanxun (a cook at Yucun Coal Mine of Xinwen Mining Bureau in Jinan City), who sang "The More I Sing, the Happier I Feel," is singing his own affairs. "I have lived for half my life and still don't know which Xue is my surname." This is such a simple and vivid sentence. Although the tune is simple, the appeal is very deep. It is difficult to achieve such achievements by breaking away from reality and engaging in artistic creation from gorgeous costumes, complex scenery, and profound tunes.

	The song types with the largest proportion in this performance are Kuaiban, Kuaisu and Xiang Sheng. These forms have become popular throughout the country. Especially Kuaiban, not only has solo Kuaiban, dialogue Kuaiban and Kuaiban group, but it also combines with other art forms with its lively characteristics, showing its vitality. In the programs of the vast majority of provincial and municipal delegations, Kuaiban is added to the music of the chorus, and Kuaiban is also inserted into the dance. Workers like to use Kuaiban to explain things on the stage. Judging from the above-mentioned most popular forms, the song types that are easy to understand and easy to master in art develop first. In addition, Er Ren Zhuan in Northeast China, Er Ren Tai in Northwest China, and Che Deng and Hua Gu in Southwest China are also mastered by the broad masses of people, because these forms have a broad foundation among the masses. But we cannot say that workers do not like or cannot master song types with strong musicality. They can still master them. For example, Sichuan Qingyin and Shandong Qinshu have strong musicality, and they are still mastered by workers. The accompaniment bands of each delegation can illustrate that they are all versatile and can accompany various forms, and they have very high musical talents.

	This workers' literary and art performance has given great enlightenment and promotion to various literary and art departments, and folk arts are no exception. From these performances, we can more clearly see the infinitely brilliant beauty and infinitely abundant vitality of socialist folk art!

### 曲艺成了工人的文艺武器

专栏：全国职工文艺会演

    曲艺成了工人的文艺武器
    陶钝
    在全国职工文艺会演的全部节目中，曲艺占了八十六个，几乎每一个省市都有几个曲艺节目。这些节目的曲种都是当地最流行、工人喜闻乐见的。我们观摩了这些节目，受到了很大的启发和教育，学习了很多的东西。根据所见到的不完全的材料，谈一谈我们的认识和体会：
    会演中的曲艺节目和其他文艺形式的节目一样，是密切地配合政治运动，大力地服务生产的。当有一些专业文艺工作者还在叫嚷或怀疑配合运动、服务生产写不出艺术性高的作品来的时候，我们工人就以自己的作品和演出回答了他们。例如技术革新和技术革命这是当前的伟大的运动，全国人民都在为了技术革新和技术革命发挥刻苦钻研的冲天干劲。这次工人文艺会演中反映技术革命的就有七十八个节目。其中曲艺也占了相当的数量。工人们在厂里日日夜夜地闹技术革命，作着什么就写什么，出现了反映当前这一伟大运动的作品。他们的创作和演出，一方面是为了娱乐，更重要的一方面是为了宣传教育，要把生产提高，要使祖国的社会主义建设加快，所以能抓住现实中重要的一环。
    从参加会演的演员来看，他们的艺术才能也是使观众惊奇的。这些演员很多是生产能手和先进生产者。例如山东快书“打走狗”表演者韩志仁就是先进生产者。观众都认为这个青年演员有才能；他的才能不仅表现在曲艺表演方面，也表现在生产方面。其他如音乐、舞蹈创作表演的演员都有很多的先进生产者。这说明了体力劳动和文艺活动不是分离开才能搞得好，相反地结合起来才搞得更好。他们自己就是劳动者，他们所表演的，也是他们自己所劳动的。他们说的话是劳动中洗炼出来的话；他们的表演动作是劳动中锻炼出来的动作。所以使观众看起来真实亲切，没有虚假的痕迹。
    工人群众掌握了曲艺形式，在使用的时候，他们根据实际的需要，发展创造了很多曲艺形式。北京市代表团演出的“人民大会堂颂”可以作为一例。人民大会堂是首都最壮丽的建筑，十个月建成迎接十年国庆，它是大跃进的标志。若是用简单的牌子曲来歌颂是多么不相称！工人们吸收“歌颂人民英雄纪念碑”和“三呼万岁”这几个联唱的经验，创造了“人民大会堂颂”的牌子曲联唱。音乐配制和表演形式都有新的创造。演唱各种曲艺的演员一同联唱，音调是不能完全协合的；而“人民大会堂颂”的音调，因为统一学习，统一排练，就出现了焕然一新的联唱。在这里再举“天津快板”为例：这曲种是最近创造的；染织工人王家骏在挖海河的劳动现场里，听到有唱“鸳鸯调”的数板，他就加以修改补充成了“天津快板”，形式灵活，容易变化，合乎语言的自然，能歌颂，也能讽刺。演唱以后马上在天津风行起来。
    在曲艺的表演艺术方面也有很多的创造。职业曲艺工作者表演以工农兵生活为内容的作品，最困难的问题是不熟悉工农兵生活。用旧的表演程式来形容新事物，是格格不入的。工人自己表演自己的日常的劳动生活，表现自己的伙伴或者本身的事迹，怎么会不内行呢？他们表演是以实际的劳动为基础提炼出来的，动作是有力的，姿态是优美的。工人在长期的劳动过程中，把劳动的动作锻炼成最省力、最便捷的，也就成了最优美的形态；不会劳动的人怎能摹拟得来呢？他们表现的人物就在自己身边，言语举动经过长期的耳闻目睹，怎么会不像呢？他们不用去体会工人的感情，把他们自己的感情抒发出来就够了。例如演唱“越唱心里越快活”的薛传训（济南市新汶矿务局禹村煤矿的炊事员），就是自己演唱自己的事情，“半辈子还不知俺姓哪个薛”这是多么朴素，又多么生动的句子。尽管曲调简单，但是感染力却是深厚得很。脱离开实际，要从服装华丽，布景复杂，曲调高深来搞艺术创造，那是难以获得这样的成绩的。
    这次会演节目中占比重最大的曲种是快板、快书和相声这几类，这几种形式已经在全国范围内流行了。特别是快板，不仅有单人快板、对口快板和快板群，它还以生动活泼的特点和其他艺术形式相结合，显示了它的生命力。绝大多数的省市代表团的节目中，大合唱的音乐中加上了快板，舞蹈中也插入了快板。工人在舞台上最喜欢用快板来说明事物。从上述的最流行的形式来看，通俗易懂，在艺术上容易掌握的曲种最先发达。此外如东北的二人转，西北的二人台，西南的车灯、花鼓等，也为广大群众所掌握，这是因为这些形式在群众中早有广泛基础的缘故。但我们不能说工人就不喜欢或者不能掌握音乐性强的曲种，他们还是能掌握的，如四川的清音和山东琴书等音乐性是较强的，还是为工人所掌握。各代表团的伴奏乐队就可以说明：他们都是多面手，能伴奏各种形式，他们是有很高的音乐才能的。
    这次职工文艺会演，给各种文艺部门很大的启示和推动，曲艺也不例外。我们从这些会演里，更加明显地看到社会主义曲艺艺术的无限灿烂的美景和无限充沛的生命力！
