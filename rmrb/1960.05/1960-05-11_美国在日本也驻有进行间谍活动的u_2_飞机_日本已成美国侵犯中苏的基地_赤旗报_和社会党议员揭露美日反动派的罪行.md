Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 10th: The Japanese Communist Party's central organ newspaper, "Akahata," published an editorial today regarding the Soviet Union's downing of a U.S. U-2 type aircraft that violated Soviet airspace, stating that due to the Soviet Union's resolute action, the ugly conspiracy of U.S. imperialism to intensify the "Cold War" and create tension, as well as its war and aggression policies, have been further exposed.

"Akahata" revealed that as early as three years ago, the United States stationed three U-2 type black jet aircraft in Japan, which took off daily from Atsugi base, a fact well known to local residents. "Akahata" pointed out that these facts prove that Japan has become an important base for U.S. imperialism's aggression against the Soviet Union and China, and the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet is an active accomplice of U.S. imperialism. The purpose of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" is to maintain this state for a long time.

"Akahata" emphasized that the issue of U.S. black jet aircraft taking off daily from Japan must be thoroughly investigated in the Diet, and this fact must be exposed to the broad masses of the people, calling on all people to participate in the struggle to prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty" in order to safeguard Japan's sovereignty, reputation, and strive for peace and independence.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 10th: Following the exposure of the U.S. U-2 type aircraft's intrusion into Soviet airspace for espionage activities, Japanese Socialist Party Diet members revealed in the Diet that the United States also has such aircraft in Japan specifically gathering intelligence on China and the Soviet Union.

Socialist Party Diet member Asukata Ichio revealed yesterday at the House of Representatives' "Security Treaty" Special Committee meeting that the United States has three U-2 type unmarked black aircraft at the Atsugi base in Japan. He said that because the U.S. U-2 type aircraft was shot down in Soviet airspace, the mission of this type of plane has been exposed and "they are obviously not used for 'meteorological observation', but for taking photos and collecting intelligence in China and Siberia."

Asukata demanded that the Kishi Nobusuke government prohibit U.S. U-2 type aircraft from using bases in Japan, and reserve Japan's right to investigate the use of U.S. military bases in order to prevent the U.S. military from using U-2 type aircraft to intrude into Chinese and Soviet airspace for espionage activities.

Under strong questioning from Socialist Party Diet members, Kishi Nobusuke, Japanese Foreign Minister Fujiyama Aiichiro, and Japanese "Defense Agency" Director General Akagi Munenori had to admit that there were indeed U.S. U-2 type aircraft at Atsugi base in Japan. However, they vaguely cited the words of the "U.S. military," saying that although they are the same U-2 type, "their usage will vary somewhat depending on the time and place," and that "those stationed in Japan are only used for meteorological observation."

Asukata pointed out: It is ridiculous for the Kishi Nobusuke government to say that the use of this type of aircraft is different in Japan.

Socialist Party Diet member Okada Haruo demanded that the Kishi Nobusuke government lodge a strong protest with the United States regarding the U-2 type aircraft issue.

The fact that U.S. U-2 type aircraft are engaged in espionage activities in Japan has caused serious anxiety among the Japanese public. Japanese opposition parties are demanding that the government take measures to ensure that all U.S. U-2 type jet aircraft immediately leave Japan.

Socialist Party's Nishimura Rikiya, during a Diet interpellation today, asked Kishi Nobusuke to pay attention to the speech delivered by Soviet Chairman Khrushchev on May 9th. Khrushchev said that if U.S. spy planes intrude into Soviet airspace again, the Soviet Union will take retaliatory measures against the countries that provide bases for U.S. reconnaissance flights.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 10th: The Japanese Mainichi Broadcasting System's commentary on May 9th regarding the U.S. U-2 type aircraft's intrusion into the Soviet border for espionage activities revealed that Japan also has this type of U.S. aircraft engaged in espionage flight activities "in and around Japanese airspace."

The radio station said, "This type of aircraft has been active in and around Japan for the past three or four years." Although the United States has tried its best to claim afterward that the U-2 type in Japan "has not engaged in espionage activities," there is nothing to guarantee that aircraft that have done espionage work in other countries will not do espionage work in Japan, especially since the United States regards the Soviet Union and China, Japan's two neighbors, as "thorns in its side." The radio station also pointed out that the Japanese Defense Agency has also compiled maps of China and the Soviet Union, and "their sources seem to be American."

The radio station continued: "If one considers how the United States recently compiled the maps of the Soviet Union and China, there will be cause for concern. Because in this incident, the Soviet Union has already lodged serious protests with the country from which the plane took off, Turkey, and the country where it was scheduled to land, Norway, etc. In other words, Japan may also become an accomplice in espionage activities."

The commentary pointed out that the U.S. aircraft's intrusion into Soviet airspace for espionage activities exposed the U.S.'s two-faced tactics of talking about peace while preparing for war.

The commentary said: "The United States, which has always talked about peace and used fairness as its signboard, has admitted that it is still engaging in insidious military espionage activities behind the scenes."

The commentary said, "The United States, on the one hand, agreed to hold top-level talks to discuss peace, and on the other hand, engaged in espionage activities, adopting an attitude of being ready for war at any time."

    美国在日本也驻有进行间谍活动的U—2飞机
    日本已成美国侵犯中苏的基地
    “赤旗报”和社会党议员揭露美日反动派的罪行
    据新华社10日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央机关报“赤旗报”今天就苏联击落侵犯苏联领空的美国U—2型飞机一事发表社论说，由于苏联的坚决行为，美帝国主义加剧“冷战”和紧张局势的丑恶阴谋以及它的战争与侵略政策被进一步揭露了。
    “赤旗报”揭露，早在三年以前，美国就在日本驻留三架U—2型黑色喷气式飞机，这种飞机每天从厚木基地起飞，这是当地居民人所周知的事实。“赤旗报”指出，这些事实证明，日本已经变成了美帝国主义侵犯苏联和中国的重要基地，同时岸信介内阁是美帝国主义的积极共谋犯。新日美“安全条约”的目的在于长期保持这种状态。
    “赤旗报”强调指出，必须在国会内彻底追究美国黑色喷气式飞机每天从日本起飞的问题，同时向广大人民揭露这个事实，呼吁全体人民参加阻止批准新“安全条约”的斗争，以便维护日本的主权、声誉和争取和平与独立。
    新华社10日讯　东京消息：美国U—2型飞机侵入苏联领空进行间谍活动的事件暴露于世以后，日本社会党议员在国会里揭露美国在日本也有这种飞机专门搜集中国和苏联的情报。
    社会党国会议员飞鸟田一雄昨天在众议院“安全条约”特别委员会会议上揭露，美国在日本的厚木基地上有着三架U—2型没有标记的黑色飞机。他说，由于美国U—2型飞机在苏联领空被击落，这种飞机的任务已经被揭穿，显然它们不是用来“观测气象”，“而是到中国和西伯利亚去拍照和搜集情报的。”
    飞鸟田要求岸信介政府禁止美国U—2型飞机在日本使用基地，并保留日本调查美军基地用途的权利，以便防止美军使用U—2型飞机侵入中苏领空进行间谍活动。
    在社会党议员强烈追究下，岸信介、日本外务相藤山爱一郎和日本“防卫厅”长官赤城宗德不得不承认在日本厚木基地上的确有美国U—2型飞机。但是他们又含糊其词地引用“美军”的话说，虽然同样是U—2型“其使用方法也会因时因地而多少有所不同”，“驻在日本的只是用于气象观测”。
    飞鸟田指出：岸信介政府说这种飞机在日本的使用方法不一样，这是可笑的。
    社会党议员冈田春夫要求岸信介政府就U—2型飞机问题向美国提出强烈的抗议。
    美国U—2型飞机在日本从事特务活动的事实引起日本公众严重的不安。日本各反对党要求政府采取措施使美国的U—2型喷气式飞机立即全部离开日本。
    社会党的西村力弥今天在国会质询时要求岸信介注意苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在5月9日发表的讲话。赫鲁晓夫说，如果再有美国间谍飞机侵犯苏联领空的话，苏联将对为美国的侦察飞行提供基地的国家采取报复性措施。
    据新华社10日讯　东京消息：日本每日广播电台9日在就美国U—2型飞机侵犯苏联国境从事间谍活动一事发表的评论中揭露，在日本也有美国这种类型的飞机“在日本上空和其周围”从事间谍飞行活动。
    电台说，“这种飞机自从三、四年以前就在日本及其周围活动”。虽然美国方面事后竭力声称在日本的U—2型“没有进行间谍活动”，但是没有任何东西能保证在其他国家做过间谍工作的飞机不会在日本做间谍工作，特别是美国把苏联和中国这两个日本的邻国当作“眼中钉”。电台并且指出：日本防卫厅还编制了中国和苏联的地图，而且“其来源好像是美国的”。
    这家电台接着说：“如果考虑到美国最近是以什么方法编制了苏联和中国的地图时，就会产生令人担心的事。因为在这次事件上，苏联早已对起飞的基地、土耳其以及预定降落的挪威等国家提出了严重的抗议。也就是说，日本也很可能成为间谍行为的共谋国。”
    评论指出，美国飞机侵犯苏联领空进行间谍活动事件暴露了美国一面谈和平一面准备战争的两面手法。
    评论说：“一向谈论和平并以公正为招牌的美国已经承认了它在背后还是在搞阴险的军事间谍活动。”
    评论说，“美国一方面答应举行最高级会议，谈论和平，另一方面又进行间谍活动，采取随时进行战争的态度。”
