	Drive Away This Devil
	—Thoughts After Re-reading "The Devil in Our Hearts"
	Jiang Dong

	Exactly twenty years ago, in 1940, on the eve of World War II, Turkish progressive writer Sabahattin Ali published his novel "The Devil in Our Hearts." Formally, it is a psychological novel depicting the love story of a young couple in Istanbul; however, since its publication, it has aroused the hatred of all dark and reactionary forces in the country, and the author has been constantly intimidated, accused, and persecuted. Four years after the novel was published, it finally met the inevitable fate in the environment at the time—it was burned in a square in Ankara, the capital of Turkey, along with many other world classic literary masterpieces and progressive literary works. Four years later, in 1948, the author himself was also assassinated with bayonets by secret agents in a despicable manner.

	Why would such a book be so violently hated by the Turkish reactionary ruling group? The reason is that Turkey, before and during World War II, while ostensibly maintaining neutrality, secretly supported the fascist German aggression, colluded with the Hitler bandits, and engaged in the heinous crime of anti-Soviet and anti-communist activities. Domestically, it frantically suppressed progressive activities, implemented militaristic and racist fascist ideological education to poison, corrupt, and anesthetize the youth, and took advantage of the weakness of some of them and their inability to take active action, so that they could be arbitrarily controlled and used at will. Sabahattin Ali vividly referred to this reactionary ideology and the poison it spread among the people as "the devil in our hearts," exposed its ugly essence in his novel, stripped away its disguise used to confuse people, and pointed out the choice facing intellectuals—either be with the people or against the people, there is no middle ground. Although the author adopted a more veiled form and wording under the conditions of censorship, its enormous power of exposure still could not but frighten the rulers, and therefore they spared no despicable means to persecute the author and his novel.

	The atrocities of the reactionaries, as one character in the book said, fully demonstrated their state of mind of hating the people and fearing the people, and demonstrated their weakness rather than strength. The author revealed the ugly face of the fascists and their essentially strong exterior but weak interior, telling the reader, "This is the philosophy of those classes who feel that they are bound to perish. They shout wildly, and if they can seize temporary power through violence, they will try their best to use this power to do the most barbaric things. But in the end they will still perish, crushed by the eternal laws of life and history." The collapse of fascist Germany is an example. But the reactionary groups will not and cannot learn any lessons from it. After World War II, the American imperialist devil inherited Hitler's mantle, intensified the establishment of military bases everywhere on the territory of other countries, attempted to ignite new wars, and stepped up the support of local reactionary regimes to enslave their own people. We have seen that in the ten years after the war, the ruling class in Turkey has actively followed the imperialist policies of aggression and war, betrayed national interests, and joined the "North Atlantic Treaty Organization" and the "Central Treaty Organization" aggressive groups; under the control of American imperialism, Turkey has in fact become a large barracks of the United States, becoming a forward base for American imperialism to prepare to attack socialist countries. The fact that the American air force plane that intruded into Soviet airspace for espionage activities and was shot down recently took off from Turkey fully illustrates the reactionary government's crime of betraying the country and harming the people by willingly acting as an accomplice of imperialism. Therefore, it is no wonder that in the years after the war when the United States enslaved Turkey, Sabahattin Ali's book was still called a "rebellious" work, removed from libraries, and forbidden to be read.

	If, when the author wrote this book, he was limited by the specific social conditions and objective conditions at the time, and mostly expressed that some intellectuals lacked a clear worldview and goals and could not take active action; then twenty years later, in today's world situation that has changed, the vast number of people and youth in Turkey will no longer be willing to endure it. They erupted like a volcano, and the demonstrations against the Menderes traitorous dictatorship put forward the slogan of ending the reactionary policy of continuing to act as a running dog of American imperialism. What Sabahattin Ali predicted in those years, "Perhaps there are very few such people, but they exist... those people who live and work in various places and conditions in our country today will become a force after they unite tomorrow, and they will hold the most powerful weapon in the world—truth!" Hasn't it become a reality?

	Now, the Turkish people, like all oppressed nations in the world, recognize that American imperialism is their most ferocious enemy and have ignited the fire of anti-imperialist struggle; their just struggle, converged into an irresistible torrent, will eventually send the imperialist devil and its running dogs into the grave.

    赶走这个魔鬼
    ——重读“我们心里的魔鬼”有感
    江东
    整整二十年以前，1940年，正是处在第二次世界大战的前夕，土耳其进步作家萨巴哈钦·阿里发表了他的长篇小说“我们心里的魔鬼”。从形式上看，这是一部心理小说，描写了伊斯坦布尔一对青年男女悲欢离合的爱情故事；然而自它问世以来，就引起了国内一切黑暗反动势力的仇视，作者也不断被恫吓、控告，受尽迫害。小说出版四年之后，它终于遭到了在当时环境下不可避免的厄运——和其他许多世界古典文学名著与进步文学作品一起在土耳其首都安卡拉的一个广场上被焚毁。又过了四年，即1948年，作者本人也被特务分子卑鄙地用刺刀暗杀了。
    这样一本书，为什么会受到土耳其反动统治集团如此狂暴地憎恨呢？原来土耳其在二次大战前和大战期间，虽然表面上保持中立，暗中却支持着法西斯德国的侵略行为，跟希特勒匪徒狼狈为奸，进行反苏反共的罪恶勾当。而在国内则疯狂地镇压进步活动，实施军国主义和种族主义的法西斯思想教育，以此来毒害、腐化和麻醉青年，并利用他们中间某些人软弱和无力积极行动的弱点，得以任意支配他们，供自己驱使。萨巴哈钦·阿里就是形象地把这种反动的思想以及它在人们当中散布的毒素称之为“我们心里的魔鬼”，在自己的小说里揭露了它的丑恶的本质，赤裸裸地剥去了它用来迷惑人的伪装，指出知识分子所面临的抉择——要么和人民在一起，要么反对人民，中间路线是没有的。尽管作者在书报检查的条件下，采用了较为隐讳的形式和词句，但是它那巨大的揭发力仍然不能不使统治者感到恐慌，因之不惜使尽一切无耻的手段对作者及他的小说进行迫害。
    反动派的暴行，诚如书中一个人物说的，十足表现了他们憎恨人民而又害怕人民的心理状态，表现了他们的软弱而不是强大。作者揭示了法西斯分子的丑陋的面貌以及他们外强中干的实质，告诉读者“这是感到自己必然遭到灭亡的那些阶级的哲学。他们狂呼叫喊，如果他们能够通过暴力取得一时的政权，他们就会尽量想办法利用这个政权来干最野蛮的事情。可是最终他们还是灭亡，被生活和历史的永恒法则所粉碎。”法西斯德国的崩溃便是一个例证。但是反动集团是不会也不可能从中吸取什么教训的。二次世界大战以后，美帝国主义这个魔鬼继承了希特勒的衣钵，变本加厉地在别国的领土上到处建立军事基地，企图煽起新的战火，并加紧扶植当地的反动政权，奴役本国人民。我们看到，土耳其在战后十余年来，统治阶级积极地追随帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，出卖民族利益，加入了“北大西洋公约”和“中央条约组织”侵略集团；在美帝国主义的控制下，土耳其实际上已变成了美国的一座大兵营，成为美帝国主义准备进攻社会主义国家的前哨。最近侵入苏联领空进行间谍活动被击落的美国空军飞机是从土耳其起飞的这一事实，就充分说明了反动政府这种甘为帝国主义帮凶的祸国殃民的罪行。因此，也就无怪乎在战后美国奴役土耳其的年代里，萨巴哈钦·阿里的这本著作仍被称为“叛逆的”作品，被清除出图书馆，禁止人们阅读。
    如果说，在作者写这本书的时候，限于当时具体的社会情况和客观条件，较多地表现了一部分知识分子缺乏明确的世界观和目标，不能积极行动；那么二十年后，在世界形势业已改观了的今天，土耳其广大的人民和青年再也不甘忍受下去，他们像火山一样爆发了，反对曼德列斯卖国独裁统治的示威斗争，提出了结束继续充当美帝国主义走狗的反动政策的口号。萨巴哈钦·阿里当年所预言的，“也许这样的人很少，但是他们是存在的……那些今天在我们国家各个地方，各种条件下生活和工作的人们，明天团结起来以后，就会成为一支力量，并且他们将握有世界上最强有力的武器——真理！”不是已经成为现实了么？
    现在，土耳其人民和全世界各被压迫民族一样，认识到美帝国主义是自己最凶恶的敌人，燃起了反帝斗争的怒火；他们这一正义的斗争，汇成一股势不可挡的巨潮，最终必将把帝国主义这个魔鬼及其走狗送进坟墓。
