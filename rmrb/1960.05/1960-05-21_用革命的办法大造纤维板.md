    Make Fiberboard in a Revolutionary Way
    Tang County, Hebei Province, using revolutionary methods to run the fiberboard manufacturing industry, within less than two months, every people's commune had its own fiberboard factory, and the county leaped from not producing an inch of fiberboard to producing 2,000 tons of fiberboard annually, equivalent to having a logging area with an annual output of 11,000 cubic meters of timber. This is a remarkable achievement, and it has opened up a very broad world for the rapid, high-quality, and economical increase of board production in China's vast small and medium-sized cities and rural areas.
    The increasing need for raw materials is a new problem in the high-speed development of socialist construction. How should we deal with this new problem? Should we slow down the pace of construction and wait for raw materials, or should we maintain high-speed development and actively adopt new and revolutionary methods to solve the raw material problem? The path taken by the people of Tang County to solve the problem of wood shortage is the latter path. This county is located in central Hebei, and besides some small shrubs, there are no large forests at all. Last year, the timber that could be provided to them from other places was only half of their actual needs, and this year's supply is far from meeting their needs. Under these circumstances, they were determined to take the revolutionary road and build fiberboard themselves. They used a large amount of wood chips and scrap wood to build fiberboard factories in the towns, and used various weeds, stalks, and peels to build fiberboard factories in the countryside. As a result, in two months, they built eleven factories and produced more than 300 tons of fiberboard, replacing more than 1,000 cubic meters of timber, which not only met the county's timber needs but also supported the use of wood in cities such as Baoding and Tianjin.
    The great significance of Tang County's large-scale fiberboard factory construction lies not only in the fact that it has solved the problem of its own required board materials, but its great significance lies first and foremost in that it starts from reality and realizes a revolution in resource utilization in fiberboard manufacturing. Fiberboard production is an emerging industry, and China's production of fiberboard began in the Great Leap Forward of 1958. At that time, it mainly used wood chips and other materials to manufacture fiberboard. This type of production is difficult to carry out on a large scale in places other than forest areas and wood processing plants. The people of Tang County widely use wild plants and agricultural and sideline product stalks such as mountain grass, reeds, wheat straw, rice straw, cotton stalks, shrubs, and distiller's grains after sorghum stalks are used to make wine to manufacture fiberboard, which breaks the past limitations of the fiberboard industry's use of single raw materials and opens up a path for the large-scale development of the fiberboard industry. According to Tang County's estimates, if only 5% of the wild grass, shrubs, and crop stalks on the county's barren hills and fields are utilized, fiberboard equivalent to more than 600,000 cubic meters of timber can be produced in a year. By analogy, it is not difficult to set up fiberboard factories in places where there are woody or herbaceous plants. If areas lacking timber, such as North China and Northwest China, can imitate Tang County's methods, rely on their own efforts and solve their own problems, they can not only meet their own needs, but also save a large amount of natural timber for use in important aspects such as industrial and urban production and construction.
    Creating a complete set of our own technical routes and methods for producing fiberboard based on existing production methods is another revolutionary aspect of Tang County's large-scale fiberboard industry construction. According to the usual methods, the production of fiberboard requires foreign equipment such as hot presses. However, under China's existing conditions, it is impossible to use these modern equipment everywhere for production. Is there any other better way? Yes, that is to make a big revolution, combine the "existing" technical experience of production with China's actual conditions, and create a set of simple and scientific methods. Being poor requires revolution, and revolution will surely find all kinds of poor methods. People's enthusiasm and creativity are endless, so there are endless ways to overcome difficulties. The people of Tang County are following such a path to victory.
    Timber is one of the important raw materials. In order to ensure the completion of half of the annual plan in the first half of the year, and to meet the needs of the mass technological revolution movement, the fiberboard industry must quickly catch up to adapt to the new situation of the continued comprehensive leap forward in the national economy this year. The people's communes in various places have the material foundation for commune-run industries, and they also have Tang County's complete set of indigenous production experience. As long as they strengthen leadership, mobilize the masses, and immediately launch a mass movement to "learn from Tang County, catch up with Tang County, and surpass Tang County" to build fiberboard on a large scale, then the new thing of indigenous fiberboard production will spread throughout the country in the shortest possible time.

### 用革命的办法大造纤维板

    用革命的办法大造纤维板
    河北省唐县用革命的办法大办纤维板制造工业，在不到两个月的时间内，每个人民公社都有了自己的纤维板工厂，全县由不生产一寸纤维板，一跃而为年产纤维板二千吨，相当于全县有了一个年产一万一千立方米木材的伐木场。这是一件了不起的大事，它为我国广大中小城镇和农村多快好省地增产板材，开拓了十分广阔的天地。
    对原材料的需要量日益增加，是社会主义建设事业高速度发展中的一个新问题。怎样对待这个新问题？是放慢建设速度，等待原材料；还是保持高速度发展，积极采取新的、革命的办法，解决原材料问题？唐县人民解决缺乏木材问题所走的道路，就是后面一条道路。这个县位处河北中部，除了有些小灌木丛外，根本没有成林的大树。去年外地能够提供给他们的木材，只及实际需要量的一半，今年供应量也远远不能满足需要。在这种情况下，他们决心走革命的道路，自己动手大造纤维板。在城镇里利用大量的木屑、碎木办纤维板厂，在农村则利用各种杂草秆皮，大办纤维板厂。结果，两个月的时间，办起了十一座工厂，生产出三百多吨纤维板，代替了一千多立方米木材，不仅满足了本县木材的需要，还支援了保定、天津等市用材。
    唐县大办纤维板工厂的重大意义，不仅仅在于它解决了自己需要的板材问题，它的重大意义首先在于从实际出发，实现了制造纤维板资源利用方面的革命。纤维板生产是一项新兴的工业，我国生产纤维板是从1958年大跃进中开始的。当时，主要还是用木材碎屑等物制造纤维板。这种生产除了林区和木材加工厂以外，其它地方就很难大办纤维板工业。唐县人民广泛利用山草、芦苇、麦秸、稻草、棉花秆、灌木以及高粱秆制酒以后的酒糟等野生植物和农副产品的秸秆等制造纤维板，就打破了过去纤维板工业采用单一原料的限制，为大量发展纤维板工业开辟了道路。据唐县估算，全县荒山野岭上的野草、灌木和农作物秸秆，只要利用5％，一年就可以生产相当于六十多万立方米木材的纤维板。以此类推，凡是有木本或草本植物的地方，都不难兴办纤维板厂。像华北、西北等缺少木材的地区如果都能仿照唐县的办法，自力更生，自己解决，不仅可以满足自己的需要，而且可以节约出大量的天然木材，用到工业和城市生产建设等重要方面去。
    在参考已有的各种生产方法的基础上，创造出一整套我们自己的生产纤维板的技术路线和方法，是唐县大办纤维板工业具有革命意义的又一个方面，按照通常的办法，生产纤维板是少不了要用热压机等洋设备的。但是，在我国的现有条件下，到处都用这些现代化的设备来生产还是办不到的。有没有其它更好的道路呢？有的，这就是大闹革命，把“已有的”生产的技术经验和我国的实际情况结合起来，创造一套简易的科学的办法。穷，就要革命，革命就一定能够找到各式各样的穷办法。人的积极性和创造性是无穷无尽的，因而战胜困难的办法也是无穷无尽的。唐县人民正是沿着这样一条道路走向胜利的。
    木材是重要的原材料之一，为了保证上半年完成全年计划的一半，为了适应全民性的技术革命运动的需要，纤维板工业必须迅速地跟上去，以适应今年国民经济继续全面跃进的新形势。各地人民公社有了社办工业的物质基础，又有了唐县一整套的土法生产经验，只要加强领导，发动群众，立即掀起一个“学唐县，赶唐县，超唐县”大造纤维板的群众运动，那末，土法生产纤维板的新生事物，就会在最短的时间内遍布全国。
