    Belgrade Propagandists Make Fools of Themselves Again
    Zhi Dan

    The U.S. plane's invasion of the Soviet Union, with its glaring crimes, has been condemned by just world opinion. Just as U.S. imperialism was in a terrible state, the Belgrade newspaper "Borba" published a commentary on May 11, expressing dissatisfaction with the world opinion condemning the United States. The commentary wrote: "Despite the gamble flight of the spy plane and the crisis caused by it, it is necessary to seek wisdom with statesmanlike demeanor and do everything conducive to peace." The commentary went on to say that "some people talk in detail about Captain Powers flying over the Soviet Union, and they are clearly most interested in disrupting the entire atmosphere before the Paris conference." The newspaper also implied that continuing to expose U.S. crimes would be an "unforgivable mistake." Belgrade's other newspaper, "Politika," even tried to excuse the U.S. government by saying that the U.S. plane incident was caused by "some irresponsible commander."

    Look, what a magnificent guise: "Do everything conducive to peace"; what touching words: to have "wisdom with statesmanlike demeanor"! Is the U.S. plane's invasion of the Soviet Union conducive to peace, is it "wisdom with statesmanlike demeanor"? Is condemning this act of aggression and demanding a halt to this military provocation not conducive to peace, is it not having "wisdom with statesmanlike demeanor"? Where have the Yugoslav modern revisionists degenerated to, they are simply defending criminals. Who is "disrupting the entire atmosphere" before the Paris conference and committing an "unforgivable mistake," is it the United States that sent the plane to invade the Soviet Union, or is it the Soviet Union and just world opinion that condemned the U.S. aggression? Should the Soviet Union and the people of the world remain silent in the face of U.S. imperialism's aggression? Look at how much the Tito clique's propagandist is like a pastor bribed by a murderer, spreading the "gospel" to the victim that in order to have happiness in the afterlife, they must tolerate all humiliation and disaster, even "talking" about the robber's crime is committing God's "unforgivable mistake"!

    Belgrade's propagandists are clearly the accompanists of the U.S. anti-Soviet march. After listening, the "New York Times" declared: "Washington's hope is that the Soviet Premier... will let this dispute be put aside at least temporarily... so that the summit conference can take place in a fairly atmosphere." The "New York Daily News" clamored to "wreck the summit conference" "unless Khrushchev... expresses his apology." It seems that the authors of the "Borba" and "Politika" commentaries should be satisfied with the role they are playing.

    However, the protagonist is still acting out his own play. Just as Belgrade's propagandists were talking about "some irresponsible commander," U.S. President Eisenhower bluntly admitted at a press conference: "Since I began my term of office, I have issued instructions to gather necessary intelligence by all practical means." This put the Belgrade supporting actors in a very embarrassing position. It turns out that "some irresponsible commander" is Eisenhower himself.

    Generally speaking, it is not easy to be a supporting actor in a play. Overzealousness can backfire, and a little carelessness can result in a slap in the face when the protagonist improvises. Belgrade's propagandists have made fools of themselves again this time.

    贝尔格莱德的宣传家又出丑了
    之丹
    美机侵犯苏联，罪迹昭彰，遭到了全世界公正舆论的谴责。正当美帝国主义处于狼狈不堪的时候，贝尔格莱德的“战斗报”5月11日发表一篇评论，对于世界舆论谴责美国表示不满。这篇评论写道：“尽管间谍飞机的赌博飞行以及因之而引起的危机，有必要寻求具有政治家风度的明智，并且做一切有利于和平的事”。评论接着说，“有些人就在苏联上空飞行的事详细谈论鲍尔士上尉，他们显然对在巴黎会议前夕扰乱整个气氛最感兴趣”。这家报纸并且还暗示，如果继续揭发美国罪行，就会犯“不可宽恕的错误”。贝尔格莱德的另一家报纸“政治报”还竟然为美国政府开脱说：美机事件是“某个不负责的指挥员”造成的。
    瞧，多么堂皇的幌子：“做一切有利于和平的事”；多么动听的词句：要有“政治家风度的明智”！难道美国飞机侵犯苏联，就是有利于和平，就是“政治家风度的明智”么？谴责这种侵略行为，要求制止这种军事挑衅，就是不利于和平，就是没有“政治家风度的明智”么？南斯拉夫现代修正主义者堕落到那里去了，他们简直在替罪犯辩护了。在巴黎会议前夕“扰乱了整个气氛”，犯了“不可宽恕的错误”的，究竟是派遣飞机侵入苏联的美国呢，还是谴责美国侵略罪行的苏联和全世界公正舆论呢？难道在美帝国主义的侵略面前，苏联和世界人民应该默尔而息么？请看铁托集团的宣传家多么像一个受了杀人犯贿赂的牧师，他向受害者传播为了来世幸福要容忍一切屈辱和灾祸的“福音”，甚至连“谈论”一下强盗的罪过就是犯了上帝“不可宽恕的错误”！
    贝尔格莱德的宣传家们显然是美国的反苏进行曲的伴唱者。听罢，“纽约时报”扬言：“华盛顿的希望是，苏联总理……会让这场争端至少暂时搁下……以使最高级会议有可能在相当气氛下”进行。“纽约每日新闻”叫嚷“搞垮最高级会议”“除非赫鲁晓夫……表示道歉”。看来，“战斗报”和“政治报”的评论作者对自己担任的配角应该是满意了。
    但是，主角还是演他自己的戏。就在贝尔格莱德的宣传家大谈其“某个不负责的指挥员”的同时，美国总统艾森豪威尔在记者招待会上直认不讳地说：“自从我开始执政以来，我就曾发出指示，用一切实际可行的办法搜集必需的情报”。这就把贝尔格莱德的配角们推到一个十分尴尬的地位。原来“某个不负责任的指挥员”就是艾森豪威尔自己。
    一般说来，一场戏中的配角是不好当的，过分热心就会帮了倒忙，而稍不留神，当主角随机应变的时候，就会挨一记耳光。贝尔格莱德的宣传家们这次又出丑了。
