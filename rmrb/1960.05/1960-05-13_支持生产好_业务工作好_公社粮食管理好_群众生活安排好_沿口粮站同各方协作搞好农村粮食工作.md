    Support Production Well, Business Work Well, Commune Grain Management Well, People's Lives Arranged Well
    Yangkou Grain Station Cooperates with All Parties to Do a Good Job in Rural Grain Work
    (Our dispatch) The staff of Yangkou Grain Station in Wusheng County, Sichuan Province, closely centering around the Party's central work, launching mass movements on a large scale from the starting point of supporting production, and cooperating with all parties, have not only done a good job in the state's grain work, but also managed the commune's grain work well, and helped the commune arrange the lives of its members, promoting a leap forward in production.
    Manages Both State Grain Business
    And Commune Grain Work
    In 1959, the grain station's various business tasks achieved "across-the-board success." The grain procurement, transfer, and processing all completed the annual plan ahead of schedule and exceeded the target. All grain depots achieved "seven-zeros," and the profits turned over by the grain processing industry increased by 68% compared with the previous year. Furthermore, they achieved "six managements": managing both state grain and commune grain; managing both state grain business and commune grain distribution; managing both commune planned grain use and public canteens, and arranging the lives of the masses. A vibrant and completely new situation emerged in the station's work. Currently, under the leadership of the local Party committee, the staff of Yangkou Grain Station are enthusiastically carrying out the "Support Production Well, Business Work Well, Commune Grain Management Well, People's Lives Arranged Well" four-good red flag competition, striving for even greater leaps forward in the work of 1960.
    In addition to being responsible for the grain supply of Yangkou Town and the receiving, transferring, and storage of grain, Yangkou Grain Station is also responsible for the grain work of Yangkou People's Commune. Since last year, especially after the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the grain station cadres began to clarify the direction of the leap forward in grain work, which must start from production, closely center around the Party's central task, and not only do a good job in the state's grain business, but also do a good job in the commune's grain work. Therefore, they educated the staff to change the past "three-managements and three-no-managements," that is, managing state grain but not commune grain, managing procurement but not sales, and managing "four-zero" grain depots but not the lives of the masses, and to improve their work with managing commune grain and helping the commune run canteens well as the center.
    Helping the Commune Harvest Grain Well
    Manage Strictly and Use Rationally
    First, they helped the commune do a good job in the receiving, management, and use of grain. During the autumn harvest last year, under the unified leadership of the commune Party committee, they sent twenty-five staff members to various management areas to help organize careful harvesting and threshing, and improve tools, so that all of the more than two thousand grain threshing containers in the commune were equipped with covers and grain receiving troughs to prevent loss and waste, achieving careful harvesting and threshing, ensuring that every grain returned home. In this way, they not only achieved a bumper harvest, but also thoroughly clarified grain production, laying a favorable foundation for planned use of grain and arranging the lives of the masses. After helping the commune achieve "harvesting well," they then focused on the work of "managing well." The grain station helped each management area establish twenty-two warehouses, and equipped each warehouse with a director and an accountant, trained full-time custodians, improved the storage system, strengthened grain storage management, and achieved "seven-zero" grain depots. In addition, they helped the commune and management areas establish grain revenue and expenditure, inspection, and inventory systems, so that grain was managed uniformly by the management area, and after completing the state procurement task, seeds, rations, feed, and reserve grain were stored separately; at the end of each season, the grain station helped conduct an inventory, ensuring that grain accounts matched and procedures were clear. In terms of "using well," they helped the commune achieve separate revenue and expenditure lines. Grain leaving the warehouse had to be approved by the management area, and the administrator delivered grain according to the grain allocation slip; at the time of sowing, the seeds needed by the production team were received from the warehouse with the grain allocation slip from the management area, and all the remaining seeds were returned; rations and feed were allocated to the canteen and farm by the management area according to the prescribed standards, achieving planned consumption; reserve grain was stored in special warehouses and required the approval of the commune before being used. Because Yangkou Grain Station did a lot of work in the commune's grain receiving, management, and use, the commune's grain was harvested carefully, managed strictly, and used rationally, and the broad masses of commune members were satisfied. Implementing "Five Grasps" and "Two Participations"
    Helping the Commune Run Canteens Well
    All the staff of Yangkou Grain Station deeply realized that public canteens are the central place for rural political, economic, and cultural activities, and doing a good job in canteen work has a very important role in consolidating the people's communes. Therefore, when the Wusheng County Party Committee issued the call last year to "make all grassroots cadres take the canteen as their home" and "everyone runs the canteen, everyone plants the canteen experimental field," they immediately responded enthusiastically, drawing a group of cadres to the commune canteen to eat, live, and labor with the commune members, and using the eight canteens of the Second Management Area as "experimental fields," summarized the experience of "five grasps and two participations," and then, under the leadership of the commune Party committee, convened eighteen on-site meetings to promote these experiences, quickly setting off a high tide of everyone running the canteen.
    The "five grasps" they summarized are: First, grasp planned grain use. They assisted each management area in combining the rural socialist education movement, organizing commune members to discuss, so that the policy of "overall consideration, comprehensive arrangement, looking ahead and behind, making up for deficiencies with surpluses, a steady stream, leaving room for maneuver" was grasped by the commune members; then, in conjunction with the commune's final settlement and distribution, they further verified the production, calculated the grain revenue and expenditure accounts, inventoried the inventory, carefully planned rationally, ensured that the commune members ate their fill, ate well, and ate sparingly, and improved their enthusiasm for production. Second, grasp planting vegetables and raising pigs. They first piloted in the Second Management Area, helping to formulate vegetable development plans, and then set off a high tide of building pumpkin hills, loofah bends, cucumber dams, and string bean roads, and set up sixteen indigenous hotbeds for raising seedlings, ensuring that vegetables were planted early and well. Now, the commune has planted more than 1,700 mu of vegetables, and each person can eat two or three catties of fresh vegetables every day. In helping the commune develop pig raising, in addition to processing 2.25 million catties of bran and supplying a portion of refined feed, they also assisted the commune in establishing 175 hydraulic and animal-powered feed processing plants, producing 100,500 catties of feed per day, and promoted the experience of feed fermentation and preparation. Now, the commune has raised more than 24,500 pigs, an average of one pig per person. In addition to ensuring that the live pig transfer plan is completed ahead of schedule and exceeded the target, each commune member can also eat twelve taels to one catty of pork per month. Third, grasp the promotion of advanced cooking methods and increase the variety of dishes. They helped the canteen make more than 20 kinds of foods, such as grain flour and rice tofu, which the commune members were very satisfied with. Fourth, grasp democratic management. The grain station selected outstanding cadres to take charge of the canteen management work, established a cook team with poor peasants as the backbone, helped establish systems for grain, cash, meal exchanges, and transfer of grain relations, and, under the leadership of the commune Party committee, opened a red and expert school for cooks, which has now trained 208 cooks. Fifth, grasp the reform of cooking utensils. In order to reduce the labor intensity of the cooks, free up more time to improve cooking skills, and save labor to support production, the staff of the grain station helped the canteen install indigenous tap water, and trial-produced eleven kinds of machines, such as slicing, shredding, dicing, washing vegetables, and washing sweet potatoes, which greatly improved work efficiency and were warmly welcomed by the masses. The so-called "two participations" are: First, grain station cadres participate in the work of the canteen, discover problems, solve them in time, and summarize and promote experiences in time. Second, commune members participate in the management of the canteen. Each canteen has established a canteen management committee, which regularly listens to the opinions of the masses, improves the work, and settles accounts and publishes the accounts every month, implementing democratic management.
    In addition, the staff of Yangkou Grain Station also actively participated in agricultural and sideline production, and made many achievements in supporting sowing, accumulating fertilizer, raising pigs, developing diversified economy, and helping poor teams catch up with rich teams.
    Not long ago, at the on-site meeting on arranging rural life in twelve provinces and cities held by the Ministry of Grain in Nanchong County, Sichuan Province, it was pointed out that the work of Yangkou Grain Station is the direction of rural grain station work, and called on the staff of the national grain system to quickly launch a mass movement of "learning from Yangkou and catching up with Yangkou" to push rural grain work to a new stage.

    支持生产好　业务工作好　公社粮食管理好　群众生活安排好
    沿口粮站同各方协作搞好农村粮食工作
    本报讯　四川省武胜县沿口粮站职工紧紧围绕着党的中心工作，从支持生产出发，大搞群众运动，协作各方，既做好了国家的粮食工作，也管好了公社的粮食工作，并且帮助公社安排好社员生活，促进了生产跃进。
    既管国家粮食业务
    又管公社粮食工作
    1959年，粮站的各项业务工作都实现了“满堂红”。粮食征购、外调、加工都提前超额完成了年度计划，全部粮仓实现了“七无”，粮食加工工业的上交利润比上年增长68％。并且做到了“六管”，既管国家粮食，又管公社粮食；既管国家粮食业务，又管公社粮食分配；既管公社计划用粮，又管公共食堂和安排群众生活。全站的工作出现了生气勃勃的崭新局面。现在，沿口粮站的职工正在当地党委的领导下，热火朝天地开展“支持生产好、业务工作好、公社粮食管理好、群众生活安排好”的四好红旗竞赛运动，争取1960年的工作得到更大的跃进。
    沿口粮站除了负责沿口镇的粮食供应和粮食的接转、调运、保管任务以外，还负责沿口人民公社的粮食工作。从去年起，特别是党的八届八中全会以后，粮站干部开始明确了粮食工作跃进的方向，必须从生产出发，紧密围绕党的中心，不仅要做好国家粮食业务，而且要做好公社的粮食工作，于是教育职工改变过去那种“三管三不管”，即管国家粮食不管公社粮食，管购不管销，管“四无”粮仓不管群众生活的思想，以管好公社粮食和帮助公社办好食堂为中心，改进工作。
    帮助公社收好粮食
    管得严密用得合理
    他们首先帮助公社做好粮食的收、管、用。在去年秋收时，他们在公社党委统一领导下，派了二十五个职工到各管理区帮助组织细收细打，改进工具，使全社两千多个拌禾桶都加了盖和接谷槽，防止丢撒浪费，做到了精收细打，颗粒还家。这样，不仅做到了丰产丰收，而且彻底地弄清了粮食产量，为有计划地使用粮食，安排好群众生活，打下了有利的基础。在帮助公社做到“收好”以后，接着就抓“管好”的工作。粮站共帮助各管理区建立了二十二个仓库，并为每个仓库配备了主任和会计，训练了专职保管员，健全了保管制度，加强了储粮保管，实现了“七无”粮仓。另外，帮助公社和管理区建立了粮食收支、检查、清仓等制度，做到粮食由管理区统一管理，在完成国家征购任务后，种子、口粮、饲料、储备粮分开储存；每季结束，粮站帮助进行一次清仓盘点，做到粮账相符，手续清楚。在“用好”方面，他们帮助公社做到了收、支两条线。粮食出仓要经过管理区批准，管理员按拨粮单付粮食；在播种时，生产队需要的种子，凭管理区的拨粮单到仓库领取，结余的全部交回；口粮和饲料，由管理区按规定标准，分月拨给食堂和饲养场，做到有计划地食用；储备粮有专仓储存，动用时要经过公社批准。由于沿口粮站对公社粮食收、管、用方面做了许多工作，因而这个公社的粮食做到了收得精细，管得严密，用得合理，广大社员满意。实行“五抓”“两参”
    帮助公社办好食堂
    沿口粮站的全体职工，深深地认识到：公共食堂是农村政治、经济、文化活动的中心场所，做好食堂工作，对巩固人民公社有极重要的作用。因此，当去年武胜县委发出“所有基层干部以食堂为家”“人人办食堂，个个种食堂试验田”的号召以后，他们立即热烈响应，抽出一部分干部到公社食堂，与社员同吃、同住、同劳动，并以第二管理区的八个食堂作为“试验田”，总结出了“五抓、两参”的经验，然后在公社党委领导下，分别召开了十八次现场会议推广这些经验，迅速掀起了一个全民办食堂的高潮。
    他们总结的“五抓”：一是抓计划用粮。他们协助各管理区结合农村社会主义教育运动，组织社员讨论，使得“统筹兼顾，全面安排、瞻前顾后、以丰补歉、细水长流、留有余地”的方针，为社员们所掌握；接着结合公社决算分配，进一步查实产量，算清了粮食收支账，盘点了库存，精打细算地合理安排，保证了社员吃饱、吃好、吃省，提高了生产积极性。二是抓种菜养猪。他们先在第二管理区试点，帮助制订蔬菜发展规划，接着掀起大搞南瓜山、丝瓜弯、黄瓜坝、四季豆路的高潮，并搞起土法温床育苗十六处，保证蔬菜种早、种好。现在全社已种菜一千七百多亩，每人每天可以吃到二、三斤新鲜蔬菜。在帮助公社发展养猪方面，除加工二百二十五万斤统糠，供应一部分精饲料以外，还协助公社建立水力、畜力饲料加工厂一百七十五个，日产饲料十万零五百斤，推广了饲料的发酵、配制经验。现在，全社已养猪二万四千五百多头，平均每人一头猪，除了保证生猪外调计划提前超额完成以外，每个社员每月还可以吃到十二两到一斤猪肉。三是抓推广先进做饭方法，增加饭菜品种。他们帮助食堂做出了谷粉、米豆腐等二十多种食品，社员们很满意。四是抓民主管理。粮站选派优秀干部担任食堂管理工作，建立了以贫农为骨干的炊事员队伍，帮助建立了粮食、现金、客饭往来、转移粮食关系等制度，并在公社党委领导下，开办了炊事员红专学校，现在已训练了炊事员二百零八人。五是抓炊具改革。为了减轻炊事员的劳动强度，腾出更多时间提高烹饪技术，并节约劳动力支援生产，粮站职工帮助食堂普遍安上了土自来水，试制出切片、切丝、切块、洗菜、洗苕等十一种机具，大大提高了工作效率，受到了广大群众的热烈欢迎。所谓“两参”，一是粮站干部参加食堂工作，发现问题，及时解决，总结经验，及时推广。二是社员参加食堂管理，每个食堂都成立了食堂管理委员会，经常听取群众意见，改进工作，一月一结账，公布账目，实行民主管理。
    此外，沿口粮站的职工还积极参加了农业和副业生产，在支援播种、积肥、养猪、发展多种经济、帮助穷队赶上富队等方面，也做出了许多成绩。
    不久以前，粮食部在四川省南充县召开的十二个省市安排农村生活现场会议上，指出沿口粮站的工作是农村粮站工作的方向，号召全国粮食系统的职工迅速开展一个“学沿口、赶沿口”的群众运动，把农村粮食工作推向一个新的阶段。
