National Worker's Art Performance

    Cook Self-Directs and Performs
    At the evening party of the Shandong Province delegation to the National Worker's Art Performance, a solo willow lute performance deeply moved the audience. The performer, Xue Chuanxun, is already forty-four years old. He used to be a miner and is now a cook in the canteen of the Huafeng Coal Mine in Shandong Province. He used to be illiterate and only shed his illiteracy this January.
    The piece he self-composed and performed, "The More I Sing, the Happier I Feel," depicts in a simple and touching way the ambition of a worker who could not afford to study in the old society but is now, under the guidance of the Party and Chairman Mao, marching towards culture. The language of this passage is vivid, and the emotions are sincere. It is a heartfelt song from thousands of workers like Lao Xue, and it is also a loud bugle call for the advancement of this cultural army!

    炊事员自编自演
    在全国职工文艺会演山东省代表团演出的晚会上，有一个单人柳琴演唱节目，深深地感动了在座的观众。演唱者薛传训已经是四十四岁的人了，过去是矿工，现在是山东省华丰煤矿食堂的炊事员。他原来是个文盲，今年1月才摘掉文盲帽子。
    他自编自演的“越唱心里越快活”，质朴而感人地描绘了一个在旧社会念不起书，到了新社会、在党和毛主席的指引下，向文化进军的工人的雄心。这个段子的语言生动，感情真切，是千万个像老薛这样的工人出自内心的歌声，也是这一支文化大军前进的、响亮的号角声！
