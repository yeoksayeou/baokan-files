Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 30th: Seoul News: The South Korean people, who are continuing to ignite the flames of struggle against the US-Syngman Rhee clique, warmly support the Turkish people's struggle against the dictatorial government.

According to reports: Men, women, old and young in Seoul are vying to read the news and facsimile photos of the Turkish people's opposition to the dictatorial government, which are published in prominent positions in various newspapers. The report stated that the South Korean youth and students who first launched the demonstration struggle against the US-Syngman Rhee group invariably expressed, "Hope that the Turkish students will also achieve victory."

South Korean "parliamentarians" want Turkish Prime Minister Menderes to remember Syngman Rhee's fate. One "parliamentarian" said: "Any government that practices dictatorship in the name of false democracy will collapse sooner or later."
