Xinhua News Agency, 16th. The spokesman of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People’s Republic of China issued a statement today on exchanging reporters between China and the United States. The full text is as follows:

    Recently, U.S. officials have repeatedly issued statements and talks, trying hard to conceal the U.S. government's unreasonable attitude against and obstruction of mutual visits by Chinese and American reporters, and maliciously distorting the Chinese government's reasonable proposition for exchanging reporters between China and the United States on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. The spokesperson of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that it is necessary to refute it in order to set the record straight.

    First of all, it should be pointed out that although the U.S. government has always adopted a policy of hostility towards China and has tried its best to block reports about new China from the American people, the Chinese government has always adopted a reasonable attitude towards the requirements of Chinese and American journalists to go to each other's countries for news coverage in order to promote mutual understanding between the people of China and the United States. The failure to realize mutual visits by Chinese and American reporters so far is entirely caused by the U.S. government's deliberate obstruction and sabotage.

    As early as the autumn of 1956 to the spring of 1957, the Chinese government successively approved 39 American journalists to come to China for news coverage. The Chinese government did not propose at that time to have Chinese journalists visit the United States as a prerequisite, because the principle of equality and mutual benefit is a generally accepted principle in international exchanges, which goes without saying, and the U.S. government should abide by it. However, on August 7, 1956, the U.S. State Department issued a statement prohibiting American journalists from visiting China, and then more arrogantly threatened that if the Chinese government could release the American prisoners who were arrested and imprisoned for committing crimes in China, the United States could consider allowing American journalists to visit China. Therefore, except for three American journalists who came to China for interviews regardless of the ban, the rest of the American journalists who were approved by the Chinese government to enter the country failed to make the trip; even these three American journalists had their passports revoked after returning to their country.

    Later, under the pressure of the American people and world public opinion, the U.S. government was forced to change its approach. On the one hand, it approved some selected American journalists to come to China to collect intelligence; on the other hand, it openly stated that "the United States will not give reciprocal visas to Chinese holding passports issued by the Chinese Communist regime," refusing Chinese journalists to visit the United States. On August 27, 1957, the then U.S. Secretary of State Dulles further stated: "We cannot recognize that the Chinese Communist side has the right to make reciprocal demands, and we think it is best to make this clear in advance." Obviously, the U.S. government adopts this extremely arrogant imperialist attitude of refusing equality and mutual benefit and attempting to impose the U.S. government's unilateral decisions on others, its purpose is to continue to obstruct mutual visits by Chinese and American journalists, which is of course absolutely intolerable to the Chinese government and people. In order to make the U.S. government understand and abide by the minimum code of conduct in international exchanges and correct their imperialist attitude, the Chinese government believes that it is necessary to first reach a formal agreement with the United States to ensure that mutual visits by Chinese and American journalists can be carried out fairly. Therefore, on September 12, 1957, the Chinese side put forward a draft agreement statement on allowing journalists from both China and the United States to enter each other's countries for news coverage on the basis of equality and mutual benefit at the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks. However, such a reasonable proposal was resolutely rejected by the United States on the pretext that the law could not guarantee reciprocal treatment to China.

    In the past two years or more since then, the U.S. government has exhausted all kinds of tricks to deceive the public. On April 23, 1959, the U.S. State Department issued a statement refusing to reach an agreement of equality and mutual benefit with the Chinese government, and then pretended to be mysterious, saying that if there were "real" Chinese journalists applying for visas, the State Department was "prepared" to "consider" and "suggest" that the Attorney General make concessions in law. Anyone can see that this American statement, issued after Dulles' death, despite changing some wording, in essence still adheres to the unreasonable position of refusing the principle of equality and mutual benefit, and continues to oppose and obstruct mutual visits by Chinese and American journalists.

    In order to get rid of the predicament in the issue of exchanging reporters between China and the United States, the U.S. State Department continued to spread smoke in its statement on April 20, 1960, attempting to shift the responsibility for the failure of China and the United States to exchange reporters onto China. However, all sophistry cannot withstand refutation.

    The U.S. State Department’s statement stated that "According to the law, there are sufficient provisions to allow journalists to visit countries ‘equally and reciprocally’," attempting to use such an ambiguous statement to cover up the U.S. government’s unreasonable position of refusing to implement the principle of equality and mutual benefit and refusing to reach a formal agreement, thereby obstructing mutual visits by Chinese and American journalists. This is absolutely impossible. People have not forgotten that, as mentioned above, Dulles once clearly stated in 1957 that "this is something we cannot do according to the law." The recent statement by the U.S. State Department not only cannot absolve the United States of its responsibility, but also further exposes the inconsistency and insincerity of the United States. Because, if people believe Dulles’ past statements, then the recent statement by the U.S. State Department is clearly a deception; conversely, if you believe the recent statement by the U.S. State Department, then Dulles was obviously talking nonsense in the past. This situation can only further prove that for such a capricious and untrustworthy government, it is absolutely necessary for the Chinese government to insist on first reaching a formal agreement based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit.

    This statement also said that China has no formal agreements with some countries, but China has reporters stationed there, which shows that China also believes that it is not necessary to conclude such an agreement. It should be pointed out that whether China must first reach an agreement to exchange reporters with other countries is entirely a matter for the Chinese government to decide according to its needs, and the United States has no right to interfere. As for the United States, since it is so arrogant towards the 650 million Chinese people who have stood up that it despises international codes of conduct and refuses to implement equality and mutual benefit, isn't it completely legitimate for the Chinese people to insist that it recognize the principle of equality and mutual benefit and accept the constraints of international agreements?

    This statement also said that no Chinese journalists have applied to visit the United States so far, which shows that China has no real interest in exchanging reporters. This is completely sophistry. Since the U.S. government has repeatedly and publicly announced its refusal to grant Chinese journalists equal and reciprocal rights, and since the U.S. has so far refused to reach a formal agreement with China on exchanging reporters, it is only natural that no Chinese journalists have filed applications to visit the United States. The Chinese government’s position on the issue of exchanging reporters between China and the United States is consistent, clear and beyond reproach. Recently, Premier Zhou Enlai reiterated China’s solemn position at a press conference in Kathmandu. That is: "We insist on the principle of reciprocity. The two governments must sign an agreement on exchanging journalists with each other."

    Whether mutual visits by Chinese and American journalists can be realized is not a matter for the Chinese side, but for the American side. If the U.S. government sincerely hopes to promote mutual visits by journalists from the two countries, then it must abandon its extremely arrogant imperialist attitude and honestly reach an agreement with China on exchanging journalists.

    我外交部新闻司就中美两国互换记者问题发表声明
    中国政府坚持根据平等互惠原则达成协议
    美国政府蓄意阻挠破坏两国记者实现互访
    如美国政府有意促进记者互访必须放弃极端狂妄的帝国主义态度
    新华社16日讯　中华人民共和国外交部新闻司发言人今天就中美两国互换记者问题发表声明，全文如下：
    最近一个时期以来，美国官方屡次发表声明和谈话，竭力掩饰美国政府反对和阻挠中美记者互访的无理态度，恶意歪曲中国政府对于中美两国在平等互惠的基础上互换记者的合理主张。外交部新闻司发言人认为有必要给予驳斥，以正视听。
    首先应该指出，尽管美国政府一贯采取敌视中国的政策，竭力对美国人民封锁关于新中国的报道，中国政府为了促进中美两国人民之间的相互了解，对于中美两国记者前往对方国家进行新闻采访的要求，仍然始终采取合情合理的态度。中美两国记者互访至今未能实现，完全是美国政府蓄意阻挠和破坏所造成的。
    早在1956年秋季至1957年春季，中国政府就曾先后批准了三十九名美国记者前来中国采访新闻。中国政府当时并未提出以中国记者去美国采访作为先决条件，因为平等互惠原则是国际交往中早已公认的一般准则，不言而喻，美国政府理应遵守。但是，1956年8月7日美国国务院却发表声明禁止美国记者访华，随后更狂妄地要挟说，如果中国政府能够释放由于在中国犯罪而被逮捕监禁的美国犯人，美国才可以考虑允许美国记者访华的问题。因而，除了三名美国记者不顾禁令来到中国采访之外，其余被中国政府批准入境的美国记者均未能成行；即使这三名美国记者也在回国以后被吊销了护照。
    后来，慑于美国人民和世界舆论的压力，美国政府被迫改变做法。它一方面批准某些经过挑选的美国记者前来中国搜集情报；另方面则公然声称“美国不会给持有中国共产党政权发给的护照的中国人以互惠的签证”，拒绝中国记者访美。1957年8月27日，美国故国务卿杜勒斯更进一步声明：“我们不能承认中国共产党方面有权提出互惠的要求，我们认为最好事先就把这点交代清楚。”显而易见，美国政府之所以采取这种拒绝平等互惠，企图将美国政府的片面决定强加于人的极端狂妄的帝国主义态度，其目的就是为了继续阻挠中美两国记者互相访问，这当然是中国政府和人民绝对不能容忍的。为了使美国政府懂得并遵守国际交往中起码的行为准则，纠正他们的帝国主义态度，中国政府认为有必要首先同美国达成一个正式协议，以保证中美记者互访能够公正地进行。于是中国方面乃在1957年9月12日中美大使级会谈中提出了关于中美两国在平等互惠的基础上准许对方记者入境采访新闻的协议声明草案。但是，这样一个合情合理的方案又被美国以法律不能保证给予中国互惠待遇为借口断然拒绝。
    此后两年多来，美国政府耍尽种种手法，蒙混视听。1959年4月23日美国国务院发表声明，拒绝同中国政府达成平等互惠的协议，而又故弄玄虚地说什么，如果有“真正的”中国记者申请签证，国务院“准备”“考虑”“建议”司法部长在法律上予以通融。谁都可以看出，这个在杜勒斯死后发表的美国声明，尽管改变了某些说法，实质上仍然坚持拒绝平等互惠原则的无理立场，继续反对和阻挠中美记者互访。
    为了摆脱在中美互换记者问题上的困境，美国国务院在1960年4月20日的声明中继续散布烟幕，企图把中美不能互换记者的责任推到中国的身上。但是，一切诡辩都是经不起一驳的。
    美国国务院的声明表示，“根据法律，已有充分的规定允许记者可以‘平等互惠地’访问各国”，企图以这样一句闪烁其词的话来掩盖美国政府拒绝实行平等互惠的原则，拒绝达成正式的协议，从而阻挠中美记者互访的无理立场，那是绝对办不到的。人们没有忘记，如前所述，杜勒斯在1957年曾经明确表示，“这种事情是我们根据法律所不能做的”。美国国务院最近的声明不仅不能为美国开脱责任，反而更加暴露了美国的前后矛盾和没有诚意。因为，如果人们相信杜勒斯过去的说法，那么最近美国国务院的声明显然是一种欺骗；反之，如果相信最近美国国务院的声明，那么，杜勒斯过去显然是在胡说八道。这种情况只能进一步证明，对于这样一个反复无常、说话不算数的政府，中国政府坚持必须首先达成以平等互惠原则为基础的正式协议，是完全必要的。
    这个声明又说，中国同某些国家没有正式协议，但是中国却在那里派有记者，可见中国也认为没有必要缔结这种协议。应该指出，中国同别的国家交换记者，是否必须首先达成协议，这完全是中国政府根据情况需要来决定的事情，美国无权过问。至于说到美国，既然它对站起来的六亿五千万中国人民竟狂妄到蔑视国际行为准则，拒绝实行平等互惠，那么，中国人民坚持要求它承认平等互惠的原则，接受国际协议的约束，不是完全正当的吗？
    这个声明还说，至今没有任何中国记者申请访美，足见中国对交换记者没有真正的兴趣。这完全是强词夺理。既然美国政府一再公开宣布拒绝给中国记者以平等互惠的权利，既然美国至今拒绝同中国达成关于互换记者的正式协议，那么没有一个中国记者提出访美的申请，自是理所当然的。中国政府在中美互换记者问题上的立场是一贯的、明确的和无可非议的。最近周恩来总理在加德满都的记者招待会上再次重申了中国的严正立场。那就是：“我们坚持对等原则，两国政府必须签订一个互相交换新闻记者的协议。”
    能否实现中美记者互访，问题不在中国方面，而是在美国方面。如果美国政府真诚希望促进两国记者互访，那么它就必须放弃它那极端狂妄的帝国主义态度，老老实实地同中国达成互换记者的协议。
