	Remembering the Martyrs, High Spirits
	——On the Pingju Opera "Ode to the Eight Women"
	Zhesheng

	During the Anti-Japanese War, the glorious deeds of the eight female martyrs of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army, who threw themselves into the river, will forever live in the hearts of the people. In the Northeast, especially in Heilongjiang Province, when many people encounter difficulties in production or work, the revolutionary spirit of the eight martyrs, with their infinite loyalty to the Party and the people, their fearlessness of any difficulties, and their courage to sacrifice themselves, will always inspire them to overcome difficulties and establish meritorious services. The film "Daughters of China," which depicts this revolutionary story, has been frequently screened from the early days of liberation to the present and is a well-received and excellent film. Recently, comrades from the Qiqihar Pingju Opera Troupe have also brought the heroic images of the eight women to the stage of traditional opera. The efforts of the Pingju writers to re-process this subject matter from different ideological perspectives are commendable.

	It can be seen that the comrades of the Qiqihar Pingju Opera Troupe have conducted a serious and careful study, realizing that today, when people remember the martyrs, the most profound inspiration and education comes from their noble qualities of unwavering loyalty to the Party and the revolutionary cause, as well as their communist worldview of always believing in the inevitable victory of the revolutionary cause in the face of any difficulties. In the second scene of "Ode to the Eight Women," the dramatic conflict unfolds in depth. Instructor Leng Yun leads the female soldiers down the mountain, preparing to sneak into Liujiatun to seize the river-crossing boats, in order to prepare for the Anti-Japanese United Army's westward expedition across the river. However, Hu Xiuzhi, the director of the Liujiatun Salvation Association, risked being pursued by the enemy to deliver a terrible message: the Japanese devils were adopting the vicious tactic of consolidating villages and households throughout the area, attempting to isolate the Anti-Japanese United Army and eliminate them on the east bank of the river. The difficulties appeared so suddenly, but the heroines were very determined and full of confidence in successfully completing the mission, demonstrating their heroic spirit of courageously advancing in the face of severe struggle. The drama ends with the eight women relying on the masses to seize the boats, covering the team's completion of the river-crossing mission, while they themselves, in order to contain the enemy forces suddenly rushing to the river-crossing location, are surrounded on the riverbank, running out of ammunition and food. Leng Yun expresses the common will of the eight women:
	"For national liberation, for the communist tomorrow, smash the guns, throw ourselves into the river, and preserve our strength for the revolution as much as possible." They sing loudly: "Maintain the integrity of a Communist Party member, maintain the glory of a revolutionary soldier, for the sake of liberation, never retreat, willing to emulate the petrel flying over the Mudan River," and walk towards the waves. In the face of severe tests, the eight women do not consider personal life at all, filled with confidence in striving for the revolutionary cause.

	Adapting to the characteristics of the opera form, this play focuses on the main events and main characters. Around the main thread of Hu Xiuzhi and Aunt An infiltrating the enemy's heart, Lou Shan Town, to mobilize the masses to seize boats, it showcases a sharp and arduous struggle between the eight women and the enemy. Among them, the scenes where Hu Xiuzhi is caught by Liu Heilian at the trench-digging construction site, and Hu Xiuzhi cleverly seizes Liu Heilian's secret of betraying three Japanese devils, coercing this sinister and vicious traitor, making him dare not report to the Japanese; and the scene where Hu Xiuzhi is arrested and brought to the enemy's headquarters for setting a fire to welcome the troops into the town, and Liu Heilian again plays the role of interrogating her, and she learns from Liu Heilian's mouth the enemy's plan to raid the river-crossing location, are very compact in plot, and at the same time, to a certain extent, reflect the complexity of the struggle situation. Through this main thread, it shows the development process of Hu Xiuzhi from an active anti-Japanese member of the masses, after undergoing struggle training, becoming a strong Communist Party member. In this play, the characters of Hu Xiuzhi, Instructor Leng Yun, and Aunt An, who has rich experience in mass work, are quite clear. "Ode to the Eight Women" is a good play that inspires people to continuously move forward ideologically and has a relatively fresh artistic style.

	We also feel that there are some aspects of this play that are not satisfactory. Many events and details only promote the development of the plot and fail to reveal the complex situation of the struggle between the Anti-Japanese United Army and the Japanese devils at that time through the development of the plot, and fail to reveal the thoughts and emotions of people from all walks of life in the national liberation struggle. Although the Japanese devils in the play are vicious and terrifying, and the landlord traitors are sinister and extremely evil, their ideological dynamics are not specific, and their characters lack depth. The depiction of the era background of the eight women's struggle, the opponents in the struggle, and the masses they relied on during the struggle are not profound and distinct enough, which also affects the portrayal of the eight women's characters.

	Some very important events in the play that have a great impact on promoting the plot, such as Hu Xiuzhi's arrest, the enemy's dispatch of troops to raid Liujiatun, and Hu Xiuzhi's return to the mountain to report the news being chased by the enemy, are not explained clearly enough. And these places are precisely the important background of the moving actions of the heroic characters in the play. If they are not explained clearly, it will weaken the moving power of the heroic characters' heroic actions on us. The plot of Hu Xiuzhi and Aunt An coming to Lou Shan Town to test Granny Guo is not true. According to the relationship between the characters, this event is impossible. This actually devalues the role of Hu Xiuzhi and Aunt An, and damages the relationship between the heroic characters and the masses.

	Thank you to the Qiqihar Pingju Opera Troupe for letting us see the good play "Ode to the Eight Women." We believe that in the process of continuous performance, continuous revision, and processing, the play "Ode to the Eight Women" will become an excellent Pingju modern drama.

    缅怀先烈　斗志昂扬
    ——谈评剧“八女颂”　
    哲生
    抗日战争期间，东北抗联的革命先烈八女投江的光辉事迹，永远活在人们的心上。在东北，特别是黑龙江省，当许多人在生产或工作上遇到了困难的时候，八位先烈对党、对人民的无限忠诚、不怕任何困难、勇于自我牺牲的革命精神，随时都会鼓舞着他们去克服困难，去建立功勋。描写这个革命故事的电影“中华女儿”从解放初期到现在一直经常放映，受到人们的喜爱，是一部优秀的影片。最近，齐齐哈尔市评剧团的同志们又把八女的英雄形象搬上了戏曲舞台。评剧的作者们从不同的思想角度来重新处理这个题材，这种努力是值得称赞的。
    可以看出，齐齐哈尔评剧团的同志们进行过一番认真仔细的研究，体会到今天人们缅怀先烈，受到启发和教育最深的，是她们对党和革命事业忠忠耿耿的高贵品质，以及在任何困难面前永远确信革命事业必然取得胜利的共产主义世界观。在“八女颂”第二场里，戏剧冲突深入地展开，指导员冷云率领女战士们下山，准备潜入刘家屯掌握渡江船只，为抗联渡江西征作好准备工作。偏偏刘家屯救国会主任胡秀芝冒着敌人追击的危险，送来一个可怕的消息：日本鬼子在整个地区采取集家并屯的毒辣手段，企图把抗联孤立起来消灭在江东岸。困难出现得这样突然，但是女英雄们意志非常坚定，对于胜利完成任务充满了信心，在严重的斗争中，表现出勇往直前的英雄气概。戏剧结束在八女依靠群众夺取到船只，掩护了队伍完成渡江任务，而她们自己却为牵制突然向渡江地点奔袭的敌军，被包围在江边，处于弹尽粮绝的地步。冷云表达了八女的共同意志：
  “为了民族解放，为了共产主义的明天，把枪砸碎，投江而渡，尽可能为革命保存力量。”她们高唱着：“保持共产党员的气节，保持革命战士的光辉，为求解放，决不后退，愿效海燕在牡丹江上飞”，迎着波涛走去。在严峻的考验前，八女毫不考虑个人生命，充满着为革命事业奋斗的信心。
    适应戏曲形式的特点，这个戏集中地描写了主要事件和主要人物。围绕着胡秀芝和安大姐打进敌人心脏娄山镇发动群众夺取船只的主要线索，展示了八女和敌人进行的一场尖锐、艰苦的斗争。其中，胡秀芝在修壕工地上被刘黑脸撞见，胡秀芝机智地抓住了刘黑脸出卖过三个日本鬼子的隐私，胁制了这个阴险毒辣的汉奸，使他不敢向日本人告发；以及胡秀芝为放火迎接部队进镇被抓进敌军司令部，刘黑脸又担任了审讯她的角色，她从刘黑脸嘴中探听到敌军奔袭渡江地点的计划这两场戏，情节非常紧凑，同时又在一定程度上反映出斗争形势的复杂性。透过这一主要线索，表现了胡秀芝从一个积极的抗日群众经过斗争锻炼，成为一个坚强的共产党员的发展过程。在这个戏里，胡秀芝、指导员冷云和具有丰富群众工作经验的安大姐，这三个人物的性格是相当清晰的。“八女颂”是一出在思想上启发人们不断前进，艺术风格比较清新的好戏。
    我们也还感到这个戏有些不能令人满足的地方。许多事件和细节，仅仅只是推动了情节的发展，没有能够透过情节的发展，显示出那时抗联和日本鬼子斗争的复杂形势，显示出在民族解放斗争中各阶层人物的思想和情绪。戏里面的日本鬼子虽然毒辣、狰狞可怕，地主汉奸虽然阴险、穷凶极恶，但是他们的思想动态是不具体的，性格缺乏深度。八女斗争的时代背景、斗争的对手、斗争时依靠的群众的描写还不够深刻鲜明，也就影响到八女性格的刻划。
    戏中有些非常重要、对于推动戏剧情节产生很大作用的事件，比如胡秀芝的被捕，敌人派兵奔袭刘家屯，以及胡秀芝回山报信被敌人追击，都是交代得不够清楚的。而这些地方也正是剧中英雄人物动人的行动的重要背景，交代不清，也就减弱了英雄人物英雄行为对我们的感动力量。胡秀芝和安大姐来到娄山镇试探郭大娘的情节不真实，按照人物之间的关系，这件事情是不可能发生的。这实际上产生了贬低胡秀芝和安大姐的作用，损害了英雄人物和群众的关系。
    感谢齐齐哈尔市评剧团让我们看到了“八女颂”这出好戏。我们相信在不断演出、不断修改加工的过程中，“八女颂”这个戏，将会成为一个优秀的评剧现代剧目。
