    Adjust Labor Organization and Leverage the Effectiveness of New Tools
    The Ningbo Special District establishes pumping stations at the commune level and establishes sowing tool stations, deep plowing stations, rice transplanter stations, and shepherd teams at the production team level to ensure the matching of labor, cattle, and tools organizationally, giving full play to the power of new tools.
    (Reported by this newspaper) After a large number of complete sets of new tools have been popularized, how should labor organization be improved accordingly to give full play to the effectiveness of the new tools? The Ningbo Special District of Zhejiang Province has gained preliminary experience, which is to establish an organizational form of "four stations and one team" in communes and production teams.
    "Four stations and one team" means establishing pumping stations at the commune level, and establishing sowing tool stations, deep plowing stations, rice transplanter stations, and shepherd teams at the production team level; and establishing specialized operation groups at the production sub-team level. "Four stations and one team" implement "three unifications and three divisions". "Three unifications" means unified leadership, unified planning, and unified measures; "Three divisions" means hierarchical management, division of labor and cooperation, and division of responsibilities. The heads of the sowing tool stations, deep plowing stations, and rice transplanter stations of the production teams are generally concurrently held by the secretary or deputy secretary of the Party branch or the captain or deputy captain, and skilled new tool operators are selected as deputy heads; the shepherd team is generally headed concurrently by the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch. The basic tasks of each station are: to comprehensively arrange and allocate labor, cattle, and tools according to the production plans of the commune and production team; to be responsible for cultivating technical forces and providing technical guidance; to be responsible for the storage and repair of new tools; and to formulate and inspect labor quotas for new tools.
    After the establishment of the "four stations and one team," it has played a significant role in this year's spring plowing production. First, it organizationally ensures that new tools are promoted and used in full, making it easy to use, manage, and achieve high efficiency. Each station has established many specialized operation groups and trained technical forces, forming a huge team using new tools. Since each station has assigned special personnel as operators, implementing machine (plow) assignment to individuals, ensuring that there are people for each machine (plow), this makes it easy for each new tool to be used and managed by special personnel, and to be fully put into production when the season arrives. At the same time, the implementation of professional assignment has changed the past situation in some places where new tools were operated by only a few people, resulting in lack of proficiency in everything and low efficiency. The deep plowing stations of the production teams of Zhangzhen Commune in Shangyu County not only put all 700-plus double-wheeled double-share plows and deep plows into spring plowing, but also generally achieved high quality and high efficiency, generally plowing seven or eight inches deep, with double-wheeled double-share plows averaging seven or eight mu per day.
    Secondly, because the "four stations and one team" facilitate the matching of labor, cattle, and tools for assembly line operation, they greatly promote labor efficiency. In the past, communes and production teams in the Ningbo Special District generally only divided labor according to the five industries of agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry, sideline occupations, and fishery, and implemented comprehensive utilization of labor for many processes in agricultural production, with little professional division of labor. This division of labor is no longer suitable after the widespread promotion of new tools. Now, the "four stations and one team" are equipped with labor and animal power according to the needs of the tools, and the processes of sowing and raising seedlings, deep plowing and harrowing, pumping and irrigation, pulling and transplanting seedlings, and raising cattle are divided and cooperated, connected with each other, and mutually guaranteed, each showing its ability, so that all kinds of agricultural work are twisted into one rope. At the same time, labor is organized mainly by one station according to the different seasons of each production. For example, during the spring sowing period, the sowing tool station is the main organizer, organizing enough labor to specialize in sowing and raising seedlings, while other labor is invested in accumulating fertilizer, repairing water conservancy, and cultivating spring flowers; during the spring plowing period, the operation group of the deep plowing station and the plowing hands are fully engaged in plowing, the pumping station is responsible for pumping water for irrigation, and the labor of the rice transplanter station participates in ridge cutting and land preparation; when the transplanting season arrives, the rice transplanter station is the center, organizing the rice transplanter operation group and all operators to transplant rice, while the labor of the sowing tool station and the deep plowing station are invested in seedling protection, seedling pulling, and seedling delivery. The advantage of doing this is that it makes labor both fixed and flexible, both divided and cooperative, both professional and multi-skilled. According to typical surveys, this can increase work efficiency by 20% to 30%.

### 调整劳动组织　发挥新工具效能

    调整劳动组织　发挥新工具效能
    宁波专区以公社为单位建抽水机站，以生产队为单位建播种工具站、深耕犁站、插秧机站和牧童队，从组织上保证劳力、耕牛和工具配套，充分发挥新工具的威力。
    本报讯　在大批成套的新式工具推广以后，如何相适应地改进劳动组织，使新工具充分发挥效能？浙江省宁波专区已取得初步经验，这就是在公社、生产队建立“四站一队”的组织形式。
    “四站一队”就是以公社为单位建立抽水机站，以生产队为单位建立播种工具站、深耕犁站、插秧机站和牧童队；以生产小队为单位建立专业操作小组。“四站一队”实行“三统三分”，“三统”就是统一领导、统一规划、统一措施；“三分”是分级管理、分线协作、分工负责。生产队的播种工具站、深耕犁站和插秧机站，一般都由党支部正副书记或正副队长兼任站长，另选配技术熟练的新工具手为副站长；牧童队一般由团支部书记兼队长。各站的基本任务是：根据公社和生产队的生产规划，全面安排和调配劳力、耕牛、工具；负责培养技术力量，进行技术辅导；负责新工具的保管和修理；制订和检查新工具的劳动定额。
      “四站一队”建立以后，在今年春耕生产中已经发挥了显著的作用。首先，从组织上保证了新式工具推广一部、使用一部，便于做到用好、管好、工效高。各站都成立了许多专业操作小组，培训了技术力量，形成了一支庞大的使用新工具队伍。由于各站固定了专人当操作手，实行定机（犁）到人、有机（犁）有人，这就使每一部新工具都有专人使用和保管，便于季节到来时全部投入生产。同时实行专业定人后，改变了过去有些地方新工具由少数人操作，结果样样不精、工效不高的情况。上虞县章镇公社各生产队的深耕犁站不仅使全社七百多部双轮双铧犁、深耕犁全部投入春耕，而且普遍达到质量高、工效高，一般深耕七、八寸，双轮双铧犁平均日耕七、八亩。
    其次，由于“四站一队”便于实行劳力、耕牛、工具配套，进行流水作业，促使劳动工效大大提高。宁波专区各公社、生产队过去一般只按农牧林副渔五业分工，而对农业生产的许多工序实行劳动力综合利用，很少进行专业分工，在普遍推广新式工具以后，这种分工就不相适应了。现在，“四站一队”按工具需要配上劳力、畜力，把播种育秧、深耕细耙、抽水灌溉、拔秧插秧、养好耕牛等工序进行分工协作，相互衔接，相互保证，各显其能，使各种农活扭成一股绳。同时，按照每个生产不同季节，以一个站为主组织劳力进行生产。如春播期间，就以播种工具站为主组织足够劳力专职播种育秧，其它劳力投入积肥、修水利和培育春花；春耕期间，深耕犁站的操作组、耕耙手全力投入翻耕，抽水机站负责打水灌溉，而插秧机站的劳力便参加削畦、整地等工作；到了插秧季节，又以插秧机站为中心组织插秧机操作组、操作手全部插秧，播种工具站和深耕犁站的劳力投入护秧、拔秧和送秧等工作。这样做的好处是使劳力既固定又灵活，既分工又合作，既专业又做多面手。据典型调查，这样可提高工效20％到30％。
