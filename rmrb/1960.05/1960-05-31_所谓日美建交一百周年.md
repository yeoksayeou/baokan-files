    The So-Called Centennial of Sino-Japanese Diplomatic Relations
    Wu Han
    Japanese traitor Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, using violence to pass the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, facing nationwide opposition, deserted by his followers, and on the verge of collapse, shamelessly promoted his running-dog philosophy, saying: "If the new treaty is not ratified, Japan's friends will lose trust in Japan, and Japan will be subject to external military threats. Therefore, I firmly believe that my political path is just and correct."

    Tying Japan's national fortune to the chariot wheels of American war maniacs is called justice and correctness! Selling out the country and betraying the people to win the favor of the master is called justice and correctness! What a running-dog's face!

    His master, U.S. Under Secretary of State Dillon, at a luncheon celebrating the so-called centennial of U.S.-Japan diplomatic relations, praised his running dog: "The Japanese House of Representatives' approval of this treaty is the most satisfying thing to all of Japan's friends in the United States." At the same time, Eisenhower and Nixon both telegraphed and wrote letters to the Japanese delegation celebrating the centennial of U.S.-Japan diplomatic relations, talking about their U.S.-Japan friendship.

    The "friendship" in the mouths of American imperialists has a history to be examined. One hundred years ago, the Japanese envoy headed by Shinmi Masaoki arrived in Washington. At that time, Japan was in the late Tokugawa shogunate, and the Japanese people's anti-feudal and anti-aggression struggles were intense.

    In the same period, the people of China and Japan experienced the common suffering of being invaded and oppressed by imperialism. After the Opium War, in 1845, the U.S. Congress authorized the President to invade Japan, and shamelessly pointed out that the United States needed a naval base at sea near China, attempting to use Japan as a springboard to attack China.

    On July 8, 1853, U.S. Navy Commodore Perry led a fleet into Uraga Bay in Japan - the location of the Tokugawa shogunate near Edo. The ships were equipped with cannons, the muzzles pointing towards the shore. He left a letter demanding a reply. The fleet then sailed away. In February of the following year, Perry led a strengthened fleet of nine warships into Uraga Bay again. Under the threat of cannons, Japan negotiated for six weeks, and on March 31, it was finally forced to sign the first U.S.-Japan treaty, opening the ports of Shimoda and Hakodate. American capitalism used violence to open the first gap in the Tokugawa shogunate's 250-year isolation policy.

    Thus, the United States opened Japan's door with cannons. The U.S. government calls this act of robbery "friendship"!

    In 1858, the first U.S. Consul General Harris arrived in Shimoda. This capitalist threatened Japan that if American merchants were not given privileges, he would resort to force. As a result, Japan was forced to sign a new treaty with the United States and other countries, stipulating that foreigners be given trade rights and extraterritoriality; and that Nagasaki, Kanagawa (Yokohama), and Hyogo (Kobe) ports be opened. Foreigners were allowed to reside in Edo and Osaka; and tariffs were set at 5% for Japanese exports and 5% to 35% for imported goods.

    Thus, under American political pressure, Japan was forced to sign a typical unequal treaty, falling into a semi-colonial status. The U.S. government calls this a profound "friendship" with Japan!

    Due to the massive influx of foreign goods into Japan, Japanese farmers' domestic industries, handicrafts, and handicraft workshops suffered serious blows, and farmers became even poorer. Due to foreign capitalists extracting gold from Japan and importing silver into Japan (at that time, the gold-silver ratio in Japan was one to five, while in Europe and America it was one to fifteen), the result was a Japanese financial crisis, rising prices, and farmers' bankruptcy.

    Thus, under American economic aggression, American capitalists made a fortune, while the Japanese people suffered hardship. The U.S. government calls this a historical "friendship" with Japan.

    In 1860, Japan was forced to send envoys to the United States. This is the origin of the centennial of U.S.-Japan diplomatic relations. At this time, the United States was busy with its civil war and could not take care of aggression in the East. England replaced the United States.

    In 1864, the British, French, Dutch, and American fleets bombarded the Shimonoseki forts in Japan, and Japan was again forced to revise tariff rates and allow Britain and France to station troops in Japan.

    From the above history, it can be seen that since 1853, the United States has been the vanguard of aggression against Japan and the most ferocious enemy of the Japanese people. Especially in the fifteen years since the end of World War II, the blood debts of American imperialism to the Japanese people, such as the atomic bomb over Hiroshima, the countless crimes committed by U.S. troops stationed in Japan, the threat of U-2 aircraft, etc., are well known to you and need not be elaborated. From this, we can conclude that the definition of "friendship" of American imperialism is gunboat diplomacy, bombing, slaughter, aggression, and oppression. It can also be concluded that the American imperialists who use this set of bandit logic are unadulterated robbers. The reactionary government of Japan does not even know what shame is, sending former Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida to lead a delegation to the United States to participate in the robber's celebration, not hesitating to sell out the country and the people, and forcibly passing the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, seeking to gain the trust of the robber.

    Dillon also announced that Eisenhower will visit Japan in mid-June to celebrate this so-called centennial anniversary. Old debts plus new debts, Japanese friends, you have a tradition of heroic struggle, and your memory is fresh. You will definitely know how to receive this distinguished guest who brings such "friendship."

    We have experience in dealing with running dogs, with only one word: Strike!

    We also have experience in dealing with robbers, also with only one word: Strike!

    American imperialism also used to talk about its "friendship" with the Chinese people. Our memory is very good. We clearly remember every blood debt of American imperialism to the Chinese people. After a long and arduous struggle, in the face of the united and powerful strength of the Chinese people, American imperialism finally rolled out of mainland China. Imperialism is a paper tiger. If it doesn't roll, strike it. This experience can be used as a reference for you.

    The two words "Strike down" are used together. As long as you strike, it will definitely fall. Whether it is imperialism or the running dogs of imperialism, strike them all down. What you are fighting for is not the robber's trust in the running dog, but the support of peace-loving people all over the world. Victory will surely belong to the Japanese people!

### 所谓日美建交一百周年

    所谓日美建交一百周年
    吴晗
    日本卖国首相岸信介在用暴力通过美日军事同盟条约、遭到举国一致反对、众叛亲离、摇摇欲坠的情况下，还无耻地宣扬他的走狗哲学说：“如果不批准新条约，日本的朋友们将对日本失掉信任，日本将受到外来的军事威胁。因此，我深信，我的政治道路是正义和正确的。”
    把日本的国运拴在美国战争狂人的车轮上，叫作正义和正确！为了取得主子的欢心，不惜出卖国家，出卖人民，叫作正义和正确！好一副走狗嘴脸！
    他的主子呢，美国副国务卿狄龙在庆祝所谓美日建交一百周年的午宴会上，果然夸奖了他的走狗：“日本众议院批准这个条约，是日本在美国的所有朋友感到最满意的事。”与此同时，艾森豪威尔和尼克松都打电报写信给庆祝日美建交的日本代表团大谈其日美友谊。
    美帝国主义口中的“友谊”，是有历史可查的。一百年前，日本新见正兴的使团到了华盛顿。当时，日本正处在德川幕府的末期，日本人民反封建反侵略斗争正激烈的时候。
    在同一时期，中日两国人民经历着被帝国主义侵略压迫的共同遭遇。在鸦片战争之后，1845年，美国国会授权总统侵略日本，并且无耻地指出，美国在靠近中国的海上，要有一个海军根据地。企图以日本为跳板，向中国进攻。
    1853年7月8日美国海军少将柏利率领舰队开进了日本的浦贺湾——江户附近的德川幕府所在地，舰上装有大炮，炮口对着岸上。留下一封信，要求答复。舰队随即开走了。第二年2月柏利又率领加强了的由九艘军舰组成的舰队开进浦贺湾。日本在大炮威胁下，谈判了六个星期，3月31日终于被迫签订了第一个美日条约，开放下田和函馆两个港口。美国资本主义用暴力打开了德川幕府二百五十年来锁国政策的第一个缺口。
    这样，美国用大炮打开了日本大门。美国政府叫这种强盗行径为“友谊”！
    1858年美国第一任总领事哈利斯到了下田，这个资本家恫吓日本，如不给美国商人以特权，就要动武，结果日本又被迫签订了对美国和其他各国的新约，条约规定给外国人以贸易权利和治外法权；加开长崎、神奈川（横滨）、兵库（神户）等口岸；外国人被允许有权居住在江户和大阪；关税规定由日本输出值百抽五，入口货税率由5％到35％。
    这样，在美国的政治压力之下，日本被迫签订了典型的不平等条约，陷于半殖民地的地位，美国政府却称之为对日本深厚的“友谊”！
    由于外国货大量流入日本，给日本农民的家庭工业，手工业和手工工场以严重的打击，农民更加贫困了。由于外国资本家从日本榨取黄金，向日本输入白银（当时日本的金银比价为一比五，在欧美则为一比十五），结果造成了日本的金融危机，物价上涨，农民破产。
    这样，在美国的经济侵略下，美国资本家发了大财，日本人民则受尽苦难，美国政府却称之为对日本的历史上的“友谊”。
    1860年，日本被迫派遣驻美的使节，这就是日美建交一百周年的来历。这时候，美国忙于内战，顾不到侵略东方了，替代美国的是英国。
    1864年，英、法、荷、美四国舰队炮轰日本下关炮台，日本又被迫修改关税税率，允许英法在日本驻扎军队。
    从上面的历史，可以看出从1853年起，美国就是侵略日本的先锋，是日本人民最凶恶的敌人。特别是第二次世界大战结束以来的十五年中，美帝国主义对日本人民的血债，如广岛上空的原子弹，驻日美军所犯的数不清的罪行，U—2型飞机的威胁等等，你们知道得最清楚，不必细说了。由此可以得出结论，美帝国主义的“友谊”的定义就是炮舰政策，就是轰炸，就是屠杀，就是侵略，就是压迫。也由此可以得出结论，运用这一套强盗逻辑的美帝国主义者是不折不扣的强盗。日本的反动政府呢，更不知羞耻为何物，派遣前首相吉田茂率领使团到美国去参加强盗的庆祝，不惜出卖国家和人民，强行通过美日军事同盟条约，企求取得强盗的信任。
    狄龙还宣布，艾森豪威尔要在6月中访问日本，庆祝这个所谓一百周年纪念。旧债加新债，日本朋友们，你们是有英勇斗争传统的，记忆犹新，你们一定会懂得如何去接待这位带来这样“友谊”的贵宾的。
    对付走狗的办法，我们有经验，只有一个字：打！
    对付强盗的办法，我们也有经验，也只有一个字：打！
    美帝国主义在过去也曾经向中国人民大谈其“友谊”，我们的记性很好，我们清清楚楚记得美帝国主义对中国人民的每笔血债，经过长期的艰苦的斗争，在团结一致的中国人民强大力量面前，美帝国主义终于滚出了中国大陆。帝国主义是纸老虎，不滚就打，这条经验是可以供你们参考的。
    打倒两个字是连用的，只要打一定倒。无论是帝国主义也罢，帝国主义的走狗也罢，统统打倒。你们所进行的斗争，失去的只是强盗对走狗的信任，得到的却是全世界爱好和平人民的支持，胜利一定属于日本人民！
