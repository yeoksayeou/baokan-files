Enterprise Management Work Must Catch Up with the New Situation of the Technological Revolution
Liangjiang Machine Factory Improves Group Management Work
Jiangbei Machinery Factory Adjusts Labor Organization to Give Full Play to New Equipment
(Our Newspaper) Chongqing, The Liangjiang Machine Factory in Chongqing has actively strengthened and improved group management work during the technical innovation and revolution movement, adapting to the needs of further development of the productive forces.

After the Liangjiang Machine Factory launched the technical innovation and revolution movement, most of the workshops in the factory realized multi-machine tool management and automation. Many groups were reduced from dozens of people to a dozen or so, and management methods and systems needed to be changed in a timely manner. The factory leadership comprehensively strengthened and improved group management work from the aspects of organization, system, and business management level.

The factory, proceeding from the principle of facilitating management and adapting to production needs, strived for various methods to comprehensively adjust the group organization. Several groups with a high degree of "four modernizations" (mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, semi-automation) and similar types of work were combined into one group; those with similar types of work but different production times were re-divided according to production time; those who had already achieved automatic production lines established specialized automatic line management groups; and some sections with few people but complex products established comprehensive management groups. At the same time, the factory re-adjusted the worker administrators in the groups, combining those that could be combined (such as technicians and quality controllers combined into technical quality controllers), and those that could be concurrently held were concurrently held (such as the group leader concurrently holding the position of planning dispatcher). Education officers, mobile personnel, and support-agriculture-production personnel were added according to the new needs. Various production groups also established some necessary management systems to ensure the further implementation of the "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" and to ensure the continuous development of production. The continuous improvement of the degree of "four modernizations" requires workers to have a higher level of management. The factory seized the important link of improving the management level of workers. In addition to transferring more than 170 experienced worker administrators to supplement the groups with less management experience, the factory also successively opened 37 professional training courses, training more than 1,300 group business administrators from among the workers. The factory also systematically held various lectures on enterprise management knowledge and organized experience exchanges in group work. Various business departments also assisted various workshops in formulating regular learning systems and organized worker administrators to learn management knowledge.

Actively strengthening the political and ideological work of the groups and establishing the leadership core of the production groups is an important link in improving the management level of the groups. Party groups and core groups have been established in all production groups in the factory; some groups with particularly weak leadership were helped by sending cadres to participate in the group's work.

Due to the active strengthening of group work in the factory, most of the newly established groups have established normal order, ensuring that everything is managed and everything is arranged. The factory's production level has risen rapidly.

(Our Newspaper) Chongqing, In the technical revolution movement, the Jiangbei Machinery Factory in Chongqing timely adjusted its labor organization, creating favorable conditions for solving the contradiction between mechanization and automation and multi-variety production, so that many mechanized and automated equipment that emerged in the movement could give full play to its role.

In the "Four Modernizations" movement, the broad masses of workers in the factory transformed many machine tools into automatic machine tools and automatic production lines. These equipments often can only adapt to the processing characteristics of a certain part or several processes. When the part or process is changed, the automation device cannot be fully applied. According to the production tasks undertaken by the factory, it is necessary to carry out multi-variety production. In order to solve this contradiction and promote the further development of the technical revolution movement, the Jiangbei Machinery Factory, on the one hand, tried to gradually improve the versatility of automated equipment, and on the other hand, actively adjusted the labor organization.

The Jiangbei Machinery Factory adjusted the labor organization, using the method of "product classification, process alignment, section closure, and group openness." They first improved the product design to try to merge parts with similar sizes and adopted a large number of standard parts. For example, there were more than 400 types of screws and nuts, which were reduced to more than 200 after the merger. At the same time, according to the shape, size, and processing technology of the parts, the same types of parts were adjusted together, and "closed" sections were set up, so that this type of parts could be basically processed in this section. In the "closed" section, the same types of machine tools are divided according to the nature of the process. Keyways are concentrated in milling keyways, and planes are concentrated in turning planes. The labor organization is also adjusted according to such production organization. After the adjustment, not only the mechanical and automated equipment adapted to multi-variety production, but also avoided the excessive circulation of parts, ensuring the timely matching of finished products.

They also concentrated some small quantities of products that were not easy to classify together, and organized some groups specializing in the production of these products. Although the product varieties and processing technologies were more complicated in these groups, they greatly simplified the product varieties of automated equipment and automatic production lines, so that these equipments could give full play to their role. It also saved labor equivalent to more than 20% of the factory's workers.

In the process of adjusting the labor organization, the Jiangbei Machinery Factory also set up adjustment workers according to the number of machine tools, the number of processing varieties, and the complexity of the machine tool structure and process equipment. Generally, each section has one person, and the more has two to three people. The main responsibilities of the adjustment workers are: to prepare for production for the producers, to adjust the machine tools when changing processing parts, and to repair temporary equipment failures.

    企业管理工作要赶上技术革命的新形势
    两江机器厂改进小组管理工作
    江北机械厂调整劳动组织　新设备充分发挥作用
    本报讯　重庆市两江机器厂在技术革新和技术革命运动中，积极加强和改进小组管理工作，适应了生产力进一步发展的需要。
    两江机器厂开展技术革新和技术革命运动以后，全厂大部分车间都实现了多机床管理和自动化，许多小组由原来的几十人减少到十几人，管理方法和制度需要及时改变。工厂领导方面便从组织上、制度上和业务管理水平方面全面地加强和改进了小组管理工作。
    全厂从方便管理、适应生产需要的原则出发，争取多种方式，全面地调整了小组组织。把“四化”（机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化）程度较高而工种又相近的几组合成一组；工种虽相近但生产时间不同的，就按生产时间重新划分；已经实现了生产自动线的，就专门成立自动线专业管理小组；有的工段人不多但产品复杂，就成立综合管理小组。同时，重新调整了小组里的工人管理员，能合就合（如技术员、质量员合成技术质量员），能兼的就兼（如组长兼计划调度员），根据新的需要增设了教育员、机动员和支援农业生产员。各生产小组还建立了一些必要的管理制度，保证“两参一改三结合”的进一步贯彻，保证生产不断发展。“四化”程度的不断提高，要求职工有更高的管理水平。这个厂便紧紧抓住提高工人管理水平这一重要环节，全厂除抽调了一百七十多名有经验的工人管理员补充到各个管理经验少的小组去以外，还先后开办了三十七个专业训练班，从工人中培训了一千三百多名小组业务管理员。全厂还有计划地举办了各种企业管理知识讲座，组织了小组工作经验交流等。各业务部门也协助各车间订了经常性的学习制度，组织工人管理员学习管理知识。
    积极加强小组的政治思想工作，建立生产小组的领导核心，是提高小组管理水平的重要一环。这个厂的各个生产小组都建立了党小组和核心小组；对一些领导力量特别弱的组，就采取派干部参加小组工作等办法进行帮助。
    这个厂由于积极加强了小组工作，绝大部分新成立的小组都已建立了正常秩序，做到了事事有人管，样样有安排。全厂生产水平迅速上升。
    本报讯　重庆市江北机械厂在技术革命运动中，及时调整了劳动组织，为解决机械化自动化与多品种生产的矛盾创造了有利条件，使运动中出现的许多机械化自动化设备充分地发挥了作用。
    在“四化”运动中，全厂广大职工把许多机床改装为自动化机床和自动生产线。这些设备，往往只能适应某一零件或某几道工序的加工特点，当零件或工序变更以后，自动化装置就不能完全适用；而根据工厂承担的生产任务，又必须进行多品种生产。为了解决这一矛盾，促使技术革命运动进一步发展，江北机械厂一方面设法逐步提高自动化设备的万能性，一方面积极地调整了劳动组织。
    江北机械厂调整劳动组织，采用了“产品归类、工艺对口，工段封闭，小组开放”的办法。他们首先通过改进产品设计，尽量把尺寸相近的零件加以合并，并大量采用了标准件，如螺钉、螺帽原有四百多种，合并后减少为二百多种。同时，依照零件形状、尺寸和加工工艺，把同类型的零件调整在一起，设立“封闭式”的工段，使这一类零件在这个工段内基本加工完毕。在“封闭式”工段内按工艺性质划分同类型的机床。铣键槽的集中铣键槽，车平面的集中车平面。劳动组织也就按照这样的生产组织进行调整。经过调整以后，不仅使机械化自动化设备适应了多品种生产，而且避免了零件过多地流转，保证了成品及时配套。
    他们还把一些数量小又不容易归类的产品集中到一起，组织了一些专门生产这些产品的小组。虽然在这些小组中，产品品种和加工工艺都比较复杂，但它们却大大简化了自动化设备和自动生产线的产品品种，使这些设备充分地发挥了作用。还节约了占全厂工人20％以上的劳动力。
    江北机械厂在调整劳动组织过程中，还根据机床台数，加工品种的多少，机床结构和工艺装置复杂程度，设立了调整工。一般每个工段设一人，多则二至三人，调整工的主要职责是：为生产者作好生产准备工作，在加工零件变换时调整机床，对设备临时故障进行检修等。
