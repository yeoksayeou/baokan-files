The "June 1st" International Children's Day is approaching. As we warmly celebrate this year's "June 1st" International Children's Day, the situation in our great motherland is infinitely bright. As our socialist construction enters a new stage, our country's children's education and childcare have also achieved great accomplishments. The number of children entering school has grown rapidly. According to 1959 statistics, there were 90 million primary school students nationwide, 2.7 times more than at the beginning of liberation. The Young Pioneers have grown to 50 million members, an increase of more than 20 million since 1957. Extracurricular educational institutions for children and teenagers are also developing rapidly.

Preschool childcare has become a large-scale social undertaking in our country. With the strengthening and consolidation of rural people's communes and the general development of urban people's communes, various types of childcare organizations have rapidly developed, consolidated, and improved. Preschool children throughout the urban and rural areas are receiving collective life education, further implementing the principle of combining social education and family education, with an emphasis on social education. At the same time, many advanced working experiences have been created in various places. For example, the "Mother and Child Well-being Paradise" that appeared in Henan, Sichuan, Hebei, Shandong, etc., integrates maternity hospitals, nurseries, and kindergartens into a whole, undertaking all the work of maternal and child health care and preschool children's education, making childcare institutions networked and complete. This is a form of maternal and child health organization that is suitable for the current development needs of production and life, and it is also a very good educational organization for preschool children.

Teaching reforms in children's work have also been widely carried out. The policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor has been universally implemented. Middle and primary school teaching reforms are being tested on a large scale, and some schools have already achieved successful experiences.

With the rapid development of children's childcare and education, the ranks of children's workers are growing. According to incomplete statistics, there are more than 6 million childcare workers in urban and rural nurseries and kindergartens. The number of primary school teachers, Young Pioneer instructors, children's medical and healthcare personnel, and children's literary and art workers has also greatly increased compared to the past. The political consciousness and professional level of the vast number of children's workers are also increasing.

The achievements in the above aspects fully reflect that our country's children's education and childcare work has entered a new stage.

Currently, a large number of advanced banners and pacesetters in children's work have emerged in various places. Today, the All-China Women’s Federation, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, and the National Committee for the Defense of Children of China jointly commended and rewarded 10,000 advanced collectives and advanced children's workers. These advanced banners and pacesetters all possess noble communist styles and have a strong sense of honor and responsibility for cultivating successors to the communist cause.

Therefore, we put forward the following expectations for children's workers on all fronts:

I. Firmly establish a sense of honor and responsibility for children's work, and further recognize that children's education and childcare is a noble cause.

Children's education and childcare work serves production, serves the masses, and serves the cultivation of successors to the communist cause. It is an indispensable undertaking in socialist construction. The facts of many years, especially the facts since the Great Leap Forward, have fully proved this point. Running preschool children's education and childcare quickly, well, economically, and efficiently can liberate a large amount of female labor to participate in production; and enable the vast masses participating in production to concentrate their efforts on doing a good job in production, work, and study. At the same time, it will increase people's love for the collective and socialism, which is conducive to raising people's socialist and communist consciousness. Therefore, children's childcare and education work is an indispensable and important task in consolidating and developing people's communes, promoting the continuous leap forward of production, and promoting the cultural revolution. What is particularly important is that this work is related to the reserve labor force, the continuation of the nation, and the growth of the new generation of communism. Doing this work well will enable our descendants to receive reasonable education from an early age, receive socialist and communist education, and make children become communist new people with all-round development in morality, intelligence, and physical education.

II. In children's work, we must continue to implement the principle of combining social education and family education, with social education as the main focus.

Collective childcare has incomparable superiority. It can create better conditions in children's lives and education, so that our descendants will not be restricted by the narrow individual family circle from an early age, but will strengthen their physique, increase their knowledge, broaden their horizons, and cultivate excellent communist qualities in collective life.

In all aspects of the development of children's education and childcare organizations, the content and methods of education, we must establish the proletarian viewpoint and methods, and destroy the bourgeois viewpoint and methods. This is a struggle between two roads and two ideologies in children's education and childcare. We must adhere to educating children with communist ideology and implement the principle of giving priority to social education. At present, family education is certainly still necessary, but we must run various social organizations for educating children well, do our work well, and give full play to the superiority of social education.

III. The current childcare work for preschool children must continue to develop and continuously consolidate and improve.

In terms of development, consolidation and improvement, we must first try our best to meet the requirements of those who actively demand to participate in labor and urgently demand to send their children to nurseries. In terms of organizational form and charging standards, we must adapt to different situations and different requirements, focusing on solving the difficulties of working women who most urgently need to send their children to nurseries. We must adhere to the principle of "actively running well and voluntarily participating." While actively developing, we will rectify and consolidate existing organizations, improve the political and ideological awareness of childcare workers, purify the ranks of childcare workers, and improve the professional level of education; give greater play to the superiority of social education, so as to attract more people to voluntarily send their children to kindergartens and nurseries.

In running various preschool children's childcare work, we have always implemented the spirit of diligence and frugality. Many of them started from scratch, made do with whatever was available, and developed from small to large, from low to high.

IV. Resolutely implement the central government's instructions on combining work and rest.

Chairman Mao put forward the instruction to students to be "good in health, good in study, and good in work." We must not only implement this instruction among children and teenagers, but also implement it in preschool children according to the spirit of this instruction, and make increasing children's physical health as the first important task. It is our important responsibility to properly arrange children's learning, games and other activities and children's rest and sleep. We must ensure that children can be cultivated and exercised in collective life, but also have appropriate free activity time and sufficient sleep time, so that they can truly achieve the goal of healthy physical and mental development.

The arrangement of work and rest for childcare workers is also a very important issue.

At present, children's childcare organizations in various places are carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution in their work in full swing. Doing this work well can improve the work efficiency of childcare organizations, not only expand the number of admissions and improve the quality of service, but also better implement the spirit of combining work and rest.

Comrades! To do a good job in children's education and childcare, the most fundamental issue is to implement political command, absolutely obey the leadership of the Party, and, under the leadership of the Party, mobilize the masses and rely on the masses. Children's childcare work is related to every family, every household, and every parent, and has a very broad mass base. It is one of the important tasks for the consolidation and development of people's communes, and it is a cause of the whole party and the whole people. To do this work well, the Women's Federation must, under the unified leadership of the Party Committee of the People's Commune, be closely integrated with other work of the People's Commune, do a good job in cooperation, combine the vigorous mass movement with solid, in-depth and meticulous work, and be a promoter of children's work.

Comrades! Let us hold higher the banner of Mao Zedong Thought and make more outstanding achievements in cultivating successors to the communist cause.

    高举毛泽东思想的红旗，培养共产主义接班人
    全国妇联副主席李德全为庆祝“六一”国际儿童节的广播讲话（摘要）
    “六一”国际儿童节就要来到了。当我们热烈庆祝今年“六一”国际儿童节的时候，我们伟大祖国的形势无限美好。随着我国社会主义建设进入新的阶段，我国的儿童教育和保育事业也取得了伟大的成就。入学儿童的数量迅速增长，据1959年统计，全国有小学生九千万人，比解放初增长了二点七倍。少先队员已发展到五千万人，比1957年增长了两千多万人。少年儿童的校外教育机构也在迅速发展。
    学龄前儿童的保教事业已经成为我国大规模的社会事业。随着农村人民公社的健全巩固和城市人民公社的普遍发展，各种类型的托儿组织迅速地有了发展、巩固和提高。全国城乡广大学前儿童受到了集体生活的教养，进一步贯彻了社会教养和家庭教养相结合而以社会教养为主的原则。与此同时，各地还创造了不少先进工作经验。如河南、四川、河北、山东等地出现的“母子康福乐园”，即把妇产院、托儿所、幼儿园组成一个整体，把妇幼保健、学龄前儿童的教养工作全部担当起来，使保教机构成网成套，这是适合当前生产和生活发展需要的一种妇幼保健组织形式，也是一种很好的学龄前儿童的教育组织。
    儿童工作中的教学改革也已普遍开展起来。教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，已经普遍贯彻执行。中、小学教学改革正在大规模地进行试验，有些学校已经取得了成功的经验。
    随着儿童保育、教育事业的飞跃发展，儿童工作者的队伍日益壮大。据不完全统计，城乡托儿所、幼儿园的保教人员已达六百多万人，小学教师，少先队辅导员，儿童医务、保健人员、儿童文学艺术工作者，也比过去大大增加了。广大儿童工作者的政治觉悟和业务水平也在日益提高。
    以上各个方面的成就，充分反映了我国儿童教育与保育工作已经进入了一个新的阶段。
    目前各地大量涌现出了儿童工作方面的先进旗帜和标兵。今天全国妇联和全国总工会、共青团中央、中国人民保卫儿童全国委员会四个团体联合表扬奖励了一万名儿童工作的先进集体和先进儿童工作者。这些先进旗帜和标兵，都具有崇高的共产主义风格，对培养共产主义接班人有着强烈的光荣感和责任感。
    因此，我们对各个战线上的儿童工作者，提出以下几点希望：
    一、巩固地树立儿童工作的光荣感和责任感，进一步认识儿童教育和保育工作是崇高的事业。
    儿童的教育和保育工作，是为生产服务、为群众服务，为培养共产主义接班人服务的，是社会主义建设中不可缺少的一项事业。多年来的事实，特别是大跃进以来的事实更充分地证明了这一点。多、快、好、省地办好学龄前儿童的教育和保育事业，就能解放大量的妇女劳动力参加生产；并使参加生产的广大群众，更能集中力量，搞好生产，搞好工作和学习。同时又使人们增进热爱集体、热爱社会主义观念，有利于提高人们的社会主义、共产主义觉悟。所以儿童的保育和教育工作，是巩固发展人民公社，促进生产持续跃进，促进文化革命中的一项不可缺少的重要工作。特别重要的是这项工作，关系到劳动力的后备、民族的延续和共产主义新的一代的成长问题。做好这项工作，就能使我们的后代从小受到合理的教养，受到社会主义、共产主义教育，使儿童成为德育、智育、体育全面发展的共产主义新人。
    二、在儿童工作中要继续贯彻执行社会教养和家庭教养相结合，而以社会教养为主的原则。
    集体教养儿童，具有无比的优越性。它可以在儿童生活、教育等方面创造更好的条件，使我们的后代从小就不受狭小的个体家庭圈子的限制，而在集体生活中增强体质、增长知识，扩大眼界，培养共产主义优秀品质。
    在儿童教育、保育组织的发展，教养的内容和方法等各方面，都要大立无产阶级的观点和方法、大破资产阶级的观点和方法，这是儿童教育和保育工作中两条道路、两种思想的斗争。我们必须坚持以共产主义思想教育儿童，必须贯彻执行以社会教养为主的原则。在当前，家庭教育固然还是必要的，但是我们一定要把各种社会教养儿童的组织办好，把工作做好，充分发挥社会教养的优越性。
    三、当前学龄前儿童的保育工作要继续发展和不断地巩固提高。
    在发展与巩固提高方面，首先要尽量满足那些积极要求参加劳动、迫切要求送孩子入托的人的要求。从组织形式上和收费标准上，要适应不同情况、不同的要求，着重解决最迫切需要送孩子入托的劳动妇女的困难。我们必须坚持贯彻“积极办好，自愿参加”的原则，在积极发展中整顿巩固现有的组织，提高保教人员的政治思想觉悟，纯洁保教人员的队伍，提高教养业务水平；更大地发挥社会教养的优越性，以吸引更多的群众自愿送孩子入园入所。
    我们举办各种学龄前儿童保育工作，历年来都贯彻执行了勤俭的精神，有许多都是白手起家，因陋就简，由小到大，由低到高。
    四、坚决贯彻执行中央关于劳逸结合的指示。
    毛主席对学生提出“身体好、学习好、工作好”的指示，我们不仅在少年儿童中要贯彻执行这个指示，在学龄前儿童方面，也要根据这个指示的精神，把增进儿童身体健康作为第一个重要的任务。妥善地安排儿童的学习、游戏等活动和儿童的休息、睡眠是我们重要的责任。要做到既能使儿童在集体生活中培养锻炼，又要使他们有适当的自由活动的时间和充分的睡眠时间，这样才能真正达到使儿童身心健康发展的目的。
    对于保教人员的劳逸安排，也是十分重要的问题。
    目前各地儿童保育组织都在热火朝天地进行工作上的技术革新和技术革命，做好这个工作能提高托幼组织的工作效率，不仅能扩大收托名额，提高服务质量，而且能更好地贯彻执行劳逸结合的精神。
    同志们！我们要做好儿童的教育和保育工作，最根本的问题是实行政治挂帅，绝对服从党的领导，并在党的领导下，发动群众，依靠群众。儿童保育工作关系到每家、每户、每个父母，具有极广泛的群众基础。是人民公社巩固发展的重要工作之一，是全党全民的一项事业。妇联要做好这项工作，必须在人民公社党委的统一领导之下，和人民公社的其他工作紧紧结合起来，搞好协作，把轰轰烈烈的群众运动同扎扎实实深入细致的工作结合起来，当好儿童工作的促进派。
    同志们！让我们更高地举起毛泽东思想的旗帜，为培养共产主义接班人做出更出色的成就。
