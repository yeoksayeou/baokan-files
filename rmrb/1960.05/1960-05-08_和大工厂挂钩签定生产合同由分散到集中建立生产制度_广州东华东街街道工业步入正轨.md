Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 3rd. The Party organization and relevant departments of Donghuadong Street, Dong District, Guangzhou, are leading the rectification and improvement of this year's newly established street industry. By organizing street factories to cooperate with large factories, vigorously developing waste product utilization, and carrying out comprehensive utilization of raw materials, they have gradually established some production systems, enabling the eighty-eight street factories (sites, groups) newly established in this street this year to quickly embark on a path of healthy development. Among them, 95% of the factories are operating normally, labor productivity has greatly increased, the variety of products has increased from eighteen in early February to forty-five, and the output value in early April was sixteen times that of early February.

Since February this year, driven by the upsurge of comprehensively organizing the people's economic life, the street industry in Donghuadong Street has developed rapidly. As of early April, the street had newly established eighty-eight factories (sites, groups), with more than 1,100 residents participating in production. Due to the rapid development and short time, a small number of newly established factories have problems such as limited production avenues, insufficient normal operation, and unsound systems. How to quickly consolidate this batch of newly established industries and achieve normal production is an urgent problem to be solved.

In order to increase production tasks for street factories, the street's party and government leaders mobilized the masses to actively connect with large state-owned factories, sign contracts, and undertake the processing tasks of some semi-finished products and parts for state-owned factories, serving large-scale industries. By early April, this batch of newly established factories had established cooperative relationships with fifty state-owned enterprises, of which seven factories had signed long-term contracts with relevant state-owned factories and enterprises, becoming affiliated processing plants of these factories and enterprises. The wax pill shell processing plant, which was newly established in February this year, was not operating normally at the beginning. After signing a processing contract with Guangzhou Baozitang United Pharmaceutical Factory, it processed wax pill shells for the pharmaceutical factory, and the production task was guaranteed. At the same time, it also received support from the pharmaceutical factory in terms of technology and equipment. Therefore, the production scale continued to expand, and the output and quality rapidly improved. The number of employees increased from six at the beginning to more than thirty. Secondly, street factory workers were mobilized to vigorously grasp waste recycling and comprehensive utilization to expand production avenues. They used the purchased waste materials and the scraps from state-owned factories to make various products, such as using old iron sheets and broken iron sheets to make shoe sizes, hairpins, and book staples; using scrap cloth to make cloth shoes; and making glue from broken rubber shoes. After taking the above measures, this batch of newly established factories quickly achieved normal production in a short period of time, and some factories even faced a new situation where production tasks were greater than production capacity.

In addition to opening up production avenues, the leaders of Donghuadong Street also organized street factories to gradually implement centralized production based on the needs of the masses and specific conditions. Due to the limitation of production sites, most of this batch of newly established street factories were initially produced in a decentralized manner; later, the masses felt that decentralized production was inconvenient, running back and forth several times a day to receive and deliver tasks, their minds were not focused, and labor efficiency was low. Many people went to visit the more than twenty old factories that had been established before this year. After comparing with the old factories, they unanimously believed that the centralized production of the old factories had many advantages: first, it was convenient for management; second, it was conducive to exchanging experiences and carrying out technological innovation; third, it could concentrate efforts on production, which was conducive to improving production efficiency. Therefore, they successively put forward the demand for centralized production to the leaders. Considering that centralized production required sufficient production sites in addition to the voluntary participation of the masses, the street leaders mobilized the masses to find ways to solve the problem of production sites, and those with the conditions were first concentrated for production. Now, more than 70% of the newly established factories in the street have implemented centralized production, and have already achieved good results in improving production efficiency and product quality. For example, Chen Xingping, a member of the sewing group of the Eighth Residents Committee, used to take tasks home to do when she was producing in a decentralized manner. However, visits from relatives and friends and other trivial matters made it impossible for her to concentrate on her work. It took her two or three days to sew a set of clothes, and she was always unable to complete the production tasks on time. Now that she is working with everyone, she is no longer disturbed by other things, and she has been sewing two sets of clothes every day since April.

In order to enable the newly established street factories to quickly get on the right track, Donghuadong Street conducted "three fixes" for the newly established street factories, namely, fixing leaders, fixing production systems, and fixing production targets. Now, all factories have generally established attendance systems, financial management systems, product registration systems, quality inspection systems, learning systems, meeting systems, and accumulation and distribution systems. The establishment of these systems has guaranteed the development of production. For example, after the establishment of the management system in the wax pill shell processing plant, the waste product rate of the entire plant reached 17% in February, and no waste products were produced in early April; the production efficiency in early April was seven times higher than in early February.

### 和大工厂挂钩签定生产合同由分散到集中建立生产制度  广州东华东街街道工业步入正轨

    和大工厂挂钩签定生产合同由分散到集中建立生产制度
    广州东华东街街道工业步入正轨
    新华社广州3日电　广州市东区东华东街党组织和有关部门，领导今年新办的街道工业整顿、提高。他们通过组织街道工厂和大工厂挂钩协作，大搞废品利用和开展原料综合利用，逐步建立一些生产制度，使这条街今年以来新办的八十八间街道工厂（场、组），迅速走上健康发展的道路，其中生产正常的工厂达到95％，劳动生产率大大提高，产品品种从2月初的十八种增加到四十五种，4月上旬的产值等于2月上旬的十六倍。
    今年2月以来，在全面组织人民经济生活的高潮推动下，东华东街的街道工业迅速发展，到4月上旬为止，全街新办了工厂（场、组）八十八间，参加生产的居民达一千一百多人。由于发展快、时间短，因此，有一小部分新办的工厂存在生产门路不多，开工不够正常，制度不够健全等现象。如何使这批新办的工业迅速巩固下来，实现正常生产，是当前急需解决的问题。
    这条街的党政领导为了使街道工厂增加生产任务，便发动群众主动向国营大工厂挂钩，签订合同，承担国营工厂的部分半成品和零件加工任务，为大工业服务。到4月上旬，这批新办工厂已与五十个国营企业建立了协作关系，其中有七间工厂与有关国营工厂企业签订了长期合同，成为这些工厂企业的附属加工场，今年2月份新办起来的腊丸壳加工厂，开始时生产不够正常，自从与广州市宝滋堂联合制药厂签订加工合同以后，为制药厂加工腊丸壳，生产任务有了保证，同时还得到制药厂在技术、设备方面的支援，因此生产规模不断扩大，产量和质量迅速提高，职工人数从初办时的六个人增加到了三十多人。其次，发动街道工厂职工大抓废品回收和综合利用，扩大生产门路。他们利用收购的废料和国营工厂的边角料，制成各种产品，如利用旧铁皮、碎铁皮制鞋码、发夹、装书钉，利用碎布料做布鞋，把烂胶鞋制胶水等。经过采取以上措施，这批新办的工厂在短期内迅速做到了正常生产，有些工厂还出现了生产任务大于生产能力的新情况。
    除了开辟生产门路以外，东华东街领导上还根据群众要求和具体条件，组织街道工厂逐步实行集中生产。这批新办的街道工厂因为生产场地的限制，开始时大部分是分散生产的；后来群众感到分散生产不方便，一天几次跑来跑去领任务交任务，精神不集中，劳动效率低。许多人就到今年以前办的二十多间老厂去参观，经过与老厂对比，一致认为老厂集中生产的好处很多：第一，便于管理；第二，有利于交流经验，进行技术革新；第三，可以集中精力生产，有利于提高生产效率；因此纷纷向领导上提出集中生产的要求。街道领导上考虑到要实行集中生产，除了群众自愿以外，还需要有足够的生产场地，于是发动群众自己想办法解决生产场地问题，条件具备的先集中起来生产。现在，全街已有70％以上的新办工厂实行集中生产，并且已经收到了生产效率和产品质量提高的良好效果。如第八居民委员会车缝组的组员陈杏萍，在分散生产时，每天把任务领回家做，但是亲戚朋友来串门和其他零零碎碎的事情，使她不能集中精神干活，两三天才缝一套衣服，老是不能按时完成生产任务。现在她和大伙在一起干活，再没有别的事情打扰了，从4月份以来每天缝两套衣服。
    为了使新办的街道工厂迅速走上正轨，东华东街对新办的街道工厂进行了“三定”，即定领导人员，定生产制度，定生产指标。现在，所有工厂都普遍建立起考勤制度、财务管理制度、产品登记制度、质量检查制度、学习制度、会议制度以及积累和分配制度等等。这些制度的建立，保证了生产的发展。例如，腊丸壳加工厂建立管理制度以后，2月份全厂废品率达到17％，4月上旬没有出过一件废品；4月上旬的生产效率比2月上旬提高七倍。
