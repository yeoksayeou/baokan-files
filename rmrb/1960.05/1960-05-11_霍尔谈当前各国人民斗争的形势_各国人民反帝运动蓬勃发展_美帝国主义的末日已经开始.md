Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 9th: According to a report in the New York "Worker's Weekly" on May 8th, Gus Hall, General Secretary of the Communist Party USA, addressed a party organization in New York City last week, analyzing the anti-imperialist and patriotic movements and the struggles for democratic rights that are currently flourishing among the people of many countries around the world. He pointed out that these struggles are the "beginning of the end" for U.S. imperialism.

Hall said, "The successful uprising of the South Korean people and the defeat of Syngman Rhee, the Turkish student riots, the heroic actions of South African blacks to fight for freedom, the victorious revolution of the Cuban people against the butcher Batista, the growing mass movement in Japan, the rising fighting spirit appearing in South Vietnam and Thailand, the noise from the Philippine Islands, the developments in Panama, Venezuela and other Latin American countries, and the heroic struggles and strikes of black students in the American South," all of these are interconnected and integrated.

Hall then pointed out that the common point of these struggles is not only that they all demonstrate a new upsurge of fighting spirit (among the people of various countries), nor only that they are all struggles for more democratic and equal rights, but that these struggles and other aspects of the struggles "have a more fundamental and significant consistency. That is, the root of their problems is the same. The root of their problems all comes from Wall Street." He said, "These are uprisings and actions against the economic and political situations determined by monopoly capitalism, by the large trusts concentrated in Wall Street. These are uprisings and movements against Dulles' 'Cold War' policy."

Hall pointed out that "after the end of World War II, the old slave empires of Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, and France began to collapse." The current uprisings are the "beginning of the end of imperialism" for the Wall Street group wearing beautiful coats. "This is a just action against Wall Street enslavement, against those puppets who execute Wall Street's orders by cunning and terror means."

He said, "While the big Wall Street trusts are plundering and exploiting in these countries, U.S. government officials are fostering puppets there, using our (American people's) tax dollars to buy these people and fill their pockets, and lure them into military alliances. Now everyone can see clearly where the millions of dollars in military aid and foreign aid go every year. Now, people can understand the concept of 'Yankee Go Home' more easily."

He continued, "We, the American people, who are ourselves exploited by this group of companies and monopoly capital organizations, should not only welcome this action, but also see the unity and consistency of this action with ourselves, with our own interests. There are some people in the world who have been deceived for a time by a propaganda that says their country is a necessary bastion and outpost of the free world. But now they are turning their country into such an outpost, and they are driving away those ruling puppets and robbers labeled 'Made in America'."

Hall said, "This is a just action to fight for freedom and independence."

    霍尔谈当前各国人民斗争的形势
    各国人民反帝运动蓬勃发展
    美帝国主义的末日已经开始
    新华社日内瓦9日电　据纽约“工人周报”5月8日报道，美国共产党总书记霍尔上星期向纽约市的一个党组织发表讲话，分析了目前正在世界上许多国家人民中间蓬勃发展的反帝爱国运动和争取民主权利的斗争。他指出这些斗争是美帝国主义“末日的开始”。
    霍尔说，“南朝鲜人民成功的起义和李承晚的失败，土耳其学生的暴动，南非黑人争取自由的英勇的行动，古巴人民反对刽子手巴蒂斯塔的胜利的革命，日本日益壮大的群众运动，南越和泰国所出现的日益高涨的斗争精神，菲律宾岛屿的吵闹声，巴拿马、委内瑞拉和其他拉丁美洲国家的事态发展，以及美国南部黑人学生的英勇的斗争和罢课”，这一切都是互相联系和互为一体的。
    霍尔接着指出，这些斗争的共同点不仅在于它们都表明了（各国人民）战斗精神的新的高涨，也不仅在于它们都是争取更多的民主和平等权利的斗争，而在于这些斗争以及其他方面的斗争“有着更基本的和重大的一致性。那就是，它们的问题根源是同样的。它们的问题的根源都来自华尔街”。他说，“这些是反对由垄断资本主义、由集中在华尔街的大托辣斯决定经济和政治情况的起义和行动。这些是反对杜勒斯的‘冷战’政策的起义和运动。”
    霍尔指出，“在第二次世界大战结束以后，英国、意大利、荷兰和法国的老牌奴隶帝国开始崩溃”，目前的起义是披着漂亮外衣的华尔街集团的“帝国主义末日的开始。这是反对华尔街奴役，反对那些用狡猾的和恐怖的手段执行华尔街命令的傀儡的正义行动。”
    他说，“当华尔街的大托辣斯在这些国家掠夺和剥削的时候，美国政府官员就在那里扶植傀儡，拿我们（美国人民）纳税的美元来收买这些人和填满这些人的口袋，勾引他们参加军事同盟。现在大家都看得很清楚，每年数以百万美元计的军事援助和外援用到什么地方去了。现在，人们对于‘讨厌的美国人’这个概念是比较容易理解了。”
    他接着说：“我们这些自身也受这批公司和垄断资本组织剥削的美国人民，对这种行动不仅应当表示欢迎，而且还应当看到这种行动同我们自己，同我们自己的利益的统一和一致性。世界上有一些人被这样一种宣传欺骗了一个时候，这种宣传说：他们的国家是自由世界必要的堡垒和前哨。可是现在他们正在把自己的国家变成这样的前哨，他们正在赶走那些贴着‘美国制’商标的执政的傀儡和强盗。”
    霍尔说：“这是争取自由和独立的正当行动”。
