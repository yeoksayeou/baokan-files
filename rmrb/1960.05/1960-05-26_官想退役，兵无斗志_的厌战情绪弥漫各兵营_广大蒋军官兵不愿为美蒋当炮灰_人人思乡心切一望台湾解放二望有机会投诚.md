Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, May 24th: Chiang Kai-shek's officers and soldiers captured by the People's Liberation Army and those who defected to the People's Liberation Army revealed that the broad masses of officers and soldiers in Chiang Kai-shek's army are unwilling to be cannon fodder for the U.S.-Chiang clique. A pessimistic and anti-war sentiment of "officers want to retire, soldiers lack fighting spirit" pervades the barracks.

    Soldiers on the Chiang army gunboat "Expedition 517," who were recently captured, said that for more than ten years, they have witnessed the U.S. imperialists intensify their control over Chiang Kai-shek's army day by day. Many soldiers and lower-ranking officers are increasingly aware that fighting the People's Liberation Army means shedding blood and selling their lives for the Americans. They spoke of many instances of the U.S. Military Advisory Group's domineering behavior in Chiang's army. Once, they were digging fortifications and doing hard labor on the Penghu Islands, exhausted to the point of death. An American "advisor," wearing his hat askew, swaggered over and scolded them for doing a poor job here and digging poorly there. They were punished by these Americans. He Yechen, a sergeant squad leader of the Chiang army's 27th Division, said after defecting that American soldiers were like "supreme emperors." A U.S. Army Staff Sergeant advisor often inspected his regiment. Each time, the regimental commander and other regimental-level officers followed behind him, answering his questions at any time. After the inspection, the regimental commander, battalion commander, and company commander had to stand before him and listen to his "instructions." Many soldiers angrily cursed, "What are American devils!"

    Many Chiang army soldiers and officers, in order to avoid being oppressed and humiliated by the Americans and to avoid being cannon fodder for the U.S.-Chiang clique, are increasingly deserting and demanding retirement. Thirteen of the fifteen soldiers on the Chiang army gunboat "Expedition 517" repeatedly requested to retire. During the Spring Festival this year, more than seventy navigation and engine personnel from the Chiang army's "First Detachment of the Maritime Assault Brigade" collectively submitted a request to their superiors stating that they "no longer wanted to be soldiers." Ke Wan, a lieutenant communications officer in the Chiang Navy's Third Boat Team, after being denied retirement, deliberately beat clerks, damaged communications equipment, and openly sold kerosene privately three times, hoping to leave the Chiang army unit by "violating military discipline." The Chiang Kai-shek clique, fearing soldiers' desertion, stipulated that soldiers were not allowed to leave the ranks alone to relieve themselves during marches and were not allowed to leave the camp area casually when staying in barracks. However, the number of escapees is increasing daily, and there are constant incidents of collective escape in some units. Among the ten people captured on the "Expedition 517" gunboat, two had deserted before. After being caught and detained for three months, they were reassigned to the unit. After being captured, each of them smiled and said, "We have escaped the sea of suffering from now on!"

    Chiang army officers and soldiers, unwilling to be cannon fodder for the U.S.-Chiang clique, are constantly shrouded in a mood of homesickness, war-weariness, pain, and desolation. Many people often sing mournfully: "In the blink of an eye, my hair turns white, who will bury me when I die?" "I am a bachelor, can I find a companion in the underworld?" and other dejected and despairing tunes. Zhang Deshun, a cook in his fifties, often said before being captured: "I can still move now and cook a bowl of rice for others. When I can't work, who will pour me a glass of water!" Living a life of dependence and subservience, Chiang's officers and soldiers generally use a small monthly salary to buy wine and drink wildly to relieve their sorrows. Some take the opportunity to sleep soundly during the day, moaning without illness; some pick fights for no reason to relieve their anxieties. Still others, although they do not believe in gods, burn incense and worship Buddha, seeking witch divinations to comfort their desolate hearts.

    Captured and defected Chiang army soldiers said that Chiang army soldiers from the mainland have a particularly strong sense of homesickness and war-weariness. They are filled with grief whenever they mention their hometowns. Due to the strict secret service rule in Chiang's army, no one dares to write letters to their families, and letters from their families are also withheld by the secret service, and they cannot see them themselves. When many people miss their families, they secretly look at the places where their parents, wives, and children live on the map. Some take the opportunity to face the mainland of the motherland and silently miss them in the quiet of the night. Zhu Yongfa, a Chiang army navy officer who was recently captured, said: Soldiers from the mainland generally have two wishes. The first is the early peaceful liberation of Taiwan, so that they can return to the mainland and joyfully reunite with their families. If the first wish is not fulfilled, the second wish is to be transferred to coastal islands such as Kinmen and Matsu, so that they can find opportunities to escape back to the mainland.

### “官想退役，兵无斗志”的厌战情绪弥漫各兵营  广大蒋军官兵不愿为美蒋当炮灰  人人思乡心切一望台湾解放二望有机会投诚

    “官想退役，兵无斗志”的厌战情绪弥漫各兵营
    广大蒋军官兵不愿为美蒋当炮灰
    人人思乡心切一望台湾解放二望有机会投诚
    新华社福建前线24日电　被人民解放军俘获和向人民解放军投诚的蒋军官兵揭露：蒋介石军队中的广大官兵不愿为美蒋当炮灰，“官想退役，兵无斗志”的悲观厌战情绪笼罩各个兵营。
    不久前被俘的蒋军“远征517号”炮艇上的士兵说，十多年来，他们亲眼看到美帝国主义一天天地在加紧控制蒋介石的军队，许多士兵和下级军官越来越清楚地认识到同人民解放军作战是为美国佬流血卖命。他们谈了许多美国军事顾问团在蒋军中横行霸道的情形。有一次，他们在澎湖列岛上挖工事，做苦工，累得死去活来，美国“顾问”歪戴着帽子，大摇大摆地来了，大骂这里做得不成，那里挖得不好，他们受到了这些美国佬的处罚。蒋军二十七师中士班长贺业臣投诚过来时说，美国兵真像“太上皇”，一个美军上士顾问，经常到他所在的团视察，每次团长和别的团级军官都跟在他屁股后面，解答他随时提出的问题。视察以后，团长、营长和连长还得站到他眼前听他“训话”。许多士兵气愤得骂道：“美国鬼子算什么东西！”
    许多蒋军士兵和军官，为了不受美国的欺压凌辱，不给美蒋当炮灰，开小差、闹退役的人越来越多。蒋军“远征517号”炮艇上的十五个士兵，有十三个人数次要求退伍。今年春节期间，蒋军“第一总队海上突击支队”有七十多个航海、轮机人员集体向他们的上司提出“不当兵了”。蒋海军第三艇队中尉通讯官柯万，在申请退役不准以后，三次故意殴打文书、捣坏通讯器材，公开私卖煤油，想以“违犯军纪”达到脱离蒋军部队的目的。蒋介石集团害怕士兵开小差，规定行军时不准士兵单独出队大小便，住营房时不准随便出营区。但是逃亡人数在逐日递增，有的部队还不断出现集体逃跑的事件。在“远征517号”炮艇上被俘的十个人当中，就有两个人开过小差，他们被抓回来以后关押三个月又补到了部队。他们被俘以后，个个笑逐颜开，说：“从今逃脱苦海了！”
    不愿为美蒋当炮灰的蒋军官兵，整天笼罩在思乡厌战，痛苦凄凉的情绪中。许多人经常悲惨地唱道：“转眼间须发苍白，吾死谁来掩埋”、“我是个光棍汉，黄泉下能不能找个伴”等颓丧绝望的调子。五十多岁的“伙伕”张德顺被俘以前经常说：“我现在还能动弹，可以给别人煮碗饭，当我不能工作的时候，谁会给我端碗水喝！”在这种寄人篱下，仰人鼻息中生活的蒋军官兵，普遍地用每月一点微薄薪金沽酒狂饮，消愁解闷。有的人一有机会在大白天就蒙头大睡，无病呻吟；有的人无故寻衅打架，图解心愁。还有些人虽然不信神，但也是烧香拜佛，求巫占卜，借以安慰凄凉的心境。
    被俘和投诚的蒋军士兵说，大陆籍的蒋军士兵思乡厌战情绪尤甚，他们一提起家乡都悲痛万分。由于蒋军中有严密的特务统治，每个人都不敢给家人写信，家人写来的信也被特务扣去，本人看不到。许多人想家时，翻开地图偷偷地看看父母妻儿居住的地方，有的人在夜静更深乘机面对祖国大陆默默思念。不久前被俘的蒋军海军人员朱永法说：大陆籍士兵普遍有两个愿望。第一个是早日和平解放台湾，好回大陆和亲人欢欢喜喜地团聚，第一个愿望不成，第二个愿望是希望调往金门、马祖等沿海岛屿，便于找机会逃回大陆。
