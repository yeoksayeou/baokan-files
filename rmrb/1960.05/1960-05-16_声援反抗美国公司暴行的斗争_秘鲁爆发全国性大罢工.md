Xinhua News Agency, Lima, May 13th: A twenty-four-hour general strike broke out in Peru today, with factories, workshops, shops, transportation, banks, and service industries all ceasing work. This general strike is to express solidarity with the peasants and workers who were recently massacred for resisting the land grabs by the American Cerro de Pasco Copper Corporation and the intensified exploitation by the American-owned Paramonga Sugar Estate.

The general strike was called by the Peruvian Workers' Confederation, a unified trade union composed of workers, employees, and peasants.

On the eve of the general strike, a rally of five thousand workers and students was held in Cusco, in the south of the country, to protest the atrocities of imperialist companies and oppose the Peruvian government's forceful implementation of a university law that deprives university students of their rights.

The Peruvian Communist Party issued a statement calling on the people to mobilize to stop provocations. The statement demanded that the culprits of the massacre be brought to justice, that the police forces stationed at the Paria farm and the Paramonga sugar estate be immediately withdrawn, that the demands of the workers and peasants of the aforementioned farms and estates be met, that the land reform law be approved and the land be given to the peasants, and the statement also condemned the government for not abolishing the "La Brea-Pariñas" award, which gives privileges to the American International Petroleum Company.

    声援反抗美国公司暴行的斗争
    秘鲁爆发全国性大罢工
    新华社利马13日电　秘鲁今天爆发二十四小时总罢工，工厂、车间、商店、交通、银行和服务业都停止了工作。这次总罢工是为了声援最近因反抗美国塞罗德帕斯科铜公司的夺地行为和美资帕拉蒙加糖业庄园的加强剥削而惨遭屠杀的农民和工人。
    总罢工是在由工人、职员和农民组成的统一工会——秘鲁工人联合会的号召下举行的。
    在总罢工前夕，在南部的库斯科举行了由五千名工人和学生参加的大会，抗议帝国主义公司的暴行，并且反对秘鲁政府强力推行剥夺大学生权利的大学法。
    秘鲁共产党发表声明，号召人民动员起来制止挑衅。声明要求审讯进行屠杀的罪魁，立即撤退驻在帕里亚农场和帕拉蒙加糖业庄园的警察部队，满足上述农场和庄园的工人、农民的要求，批准土地改革法，把土地交给农民，声明还谴责政府不废除给美国国际石油公司以特权的“拉布雷亚—帕里纳斯”判定书。
