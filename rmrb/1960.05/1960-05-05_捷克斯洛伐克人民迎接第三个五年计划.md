    Czechoslovak People Welcome the Third Five-Year Plan
    Czechoslovakia Yang Černohorský
    On May 9, 1945, the Soviet army liberated Czechoslovakia, creating the possibility of establishing a people's democratic state for Czechs and Slovaks. At this time, reactionaries at home and abroad immediately began to spread the idea that socialism was absolutely unsuitable for economically highly developed countries such as Czechoslovakia. However, the great achievements made by the Czechoslovak people after 1945 completely overturned the bourgeois "theory" that socialism is not suitable for industrially developed countries.
    In the extremely short period of fifteen years, Czechoslovakia has gone through the transition from capitalism to socialism, and is currently implementing the task of building socialism as stipulated by the 11th Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party (June 1958).
    Now, Czechoslovakia's economy is already a socialist economy. Socialist components account for 95% of the production of social products, and the remainder belongs to the individual peasant economy that still exists. Industrial production, which occupies the most important position in the Czechoslovak national economy, has increased nearly threefold compared with the pre-war level. Therefore, the Czechoslovak Republic has entered the ranks of the world's most industrially developed countries. At the same time, the structure of industry has also undergone fundamental changes, with the production of the means of production accounting for 64% of all industrial products. The machine manufacturing industry has become the most important sector, with its output accounting for approximately 30% of the total industrial output.
    The most illustrative comparison is to compare the post-war industrial development of the Czechoslovak Republic with that of France, a relatively developed capitalist country. If the output of 1937 is taken as 100, then the development of the two countries in recent years is as follows:
    1937 1950 1953 1955 1958
    Czechoslovakia 100 143 210 243 326
    France 100 112 125 146 184
    Such development has enabled Czechoslovakia to catch up with and surpass France in terms of per capita output. The situation of major products in 1958 is as follows:
         Coal (converted to hard coal)  Electricity
    Czechoslovakia 4449 kg 1456 kWh
    France 1330 kg 1317 kWh
         Steel Cement
    Czechoslovakia 409 kg 305 kg
    France 328 kg 301 kg
    The development of industry has provided the possibility for the development of all sectors of the national economy, and has greatly promoted the economic cooperation between Czechoslovakia and socialist countries. Of the 300 sets of complete factory equipment exported by Czechoslovakia in the past fifteen years, the vast majority have been shipped to socialist countries. From 1950 to 1959, the trade volume between Czechoslovakia and the People's Republic of China increased by six and a half times.
    As a result of economic development, the material and cultural living standards of the entire people have continuously improved. Full employment, increased wages, and lower prices have continuously increased the real income of residents. The real wage in 1959 increased by 46% compared with 1937. This means that workers and staff can purchase almost 50% more goods than in 1937. In addition, no capitalist country can compare with Czechoslovakia in terms of free education and free medical care, as well as guarantees for workers' illnesses, old age, and vacations. In 1959, state appropriations for culture and social health care increased tenfold per capita compared with 1937.
    At present, based on the achievements already made, the Czechoslovak people are preparing to complete the magnificent tasks of the Third Five-Year Plan (1961-1965) according to the program for building socialism formulated by the 11th Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party. During the Third Five-Year Plan, while completing the task of building socialism, the Czechoslovak people will create the material and cultural prerequisites for a gradual transition to communism.
    First, efforts will be made to further strengthen the industrial nature of the Czechoslovak state. Of the total investment of 312 billion crowns (Czech currency) (54% more than the Second Five-Year Plan), industrial investment accounts for 120 billion. Industrial production will increase by 50%, five times more than before the war, accounting for 70% of the national economy. The most important sector is still the machine manufacturing industry. By 1965, the monthly output will exceed the annual output of 1937! The development of the machine manufacturing industry is also a key issue because the completion of all tasks in the Third Five-Year Plan depends on greatly improving labor productivity (which will increase by 40% in industry). It is unimaginable to achieve this without new technologies and the comprehensive mechanization and automation of production processes.
    The steel output in 1959 was 6.1 million tons, and it will increase to 10.5 million tons in 1965, or 739 kg per capita, which is much higher than the average production level in the United States in recent years. The construction of giant power stations with a capacity of 200,000 kilowatts for certain generator equipment will increase electricity production from 21.9 billion kWh in 1959 to 38 billion kWh in 1965.
    The chemical industry will develop the fastest in all sectors of the national economy. Although the production of the chemical industry has doubled in the past ten years, it still cannot meet the needs of the national economy. The newly built large-scale chemical plants will promote the production of plastics and artificial fertilizers, and master the production of synthetic rubber, synthetic alcohol, and fertilizers. Soviet oil will be the main raw material for the development of my country's chemical industry. In order to transport oil to Czechoslovakia, the construction of oil pipelines has begun.
    In agriculture, attention will first be paid to consolidating internally and further developing the agricultural cooperatives and the state farm economy, and creating prerequisites for making the intensity of agricultural production reach the level of advanced countries. The decisive task is to strengthen the care for the soil, especially as this will relate to the widespread implementation of soil improvement measures and doubling the average amount of mineral fertilizers applied compared with now. In terms of the supply of mechanized agricultural implements, by 1965, according to the plan, there will be one tractor for every 36 hectares of arable land, one combine harvester for every 158 hectares of grain crops, and one silage combine harvester for every 13 hectares of silage feed land. In general, from 1959 to 1965, agriculture will receive a total of more than 124,000 tractors. The total investment in agriculture will reach 40 billion crowns, and the agricultural output in 1965 will increase by at least 21% compared with 1960.
    The scale of development in eastern my country - Slovakia is the most magnificent in the Third Five-Year Plan, while in the capitalist period, it was only an agricultural appendage to the industrially developed Czech Republic. Now, in addition to the dozens of modern factories that have been built and have completely changed the face of Slovakia, large-scale industrial joint ventures will also be built. By 1965, Slovakia's industrial production will increase nearly sixteen times compared with 1937, and will reach the average industrial production level of the entire Czechoslovakia in 1948. By then, Slovakia will reach the general level sufficient to represent an industrially developed country. Eliminating the differences between Slovakia and the Czech Republic in terms of economic and cultural levels is an example of resolving national issues according to Lenin's principles and is of great international significance.
    Czechoslovakia is developing as an integral part of the world socialist system. Therefore, when implementing the tasks of the Third Five-Year Plan, it must fully rely on the international socialist division of labor. Trade with the Soviet Union is of great significance to the stability of the planned development of the Czechoslovak national economy. According to existing agreements, by 1965, the total trade volume between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union will account for 40% of Czechoslovakia's total foreign trade. Czechoslovakia will also further strengthen cooperation with other socialist countries, especially within the framework of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance. Czechoslovakia will also strive to develop trade relations with non-socialist countries, thereby promoting cooperation between countries with different social systems.
    The purpose of the Third Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy is primarily to further improve the people's living standards. Personal consumption will increase by 30% during this period. At the same time, special attention will be paid to improving the living standards of families with many children. During the Third Five-Year Plan, the people will receive 480,000 well-equipped houses, the living conditions will be fundamentally improved, and the possibility will be provided to complete the task put forward by the 11th Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party - ensuring that every household has a suitable house before 1970. By 1965, there will be nineteen medical stations for every 10,000 residents. The basic compulsory education in schools will be extended from the current eight years to nine years.
    Czechoslovakia's Third Five-Year Plan is an economic plan for developing an advanced socialist society and is of great significance both domestically and internationally.
    The Third Five-Year Plan will create the material prerequisites for realizing the grand goals of building socialism and gradually transitioning to communism formulated by the Party's 11th Congress. (Attached picture)

    捷克斯洛伐克人民迎接第三个五年计划
    捷克斯洛伐克  扬·契尔诺戈尔斯基
    1945年5月9日苏军解放了捷克斯洛伐克，为建立捷克人和斯洛伐克人的人民民主国家创造了可能性。这时，国内外的反动派马上就开始宣传一种论调，说什么社会主义对于经济上高度发达的国家，如捷克斯洛伐克，是绝对不适用的。然而，捷克斯洛伐克人民在1945年以后所取得的巨大成就，彻底推翻了所谓社会主义不适于工业发达的国家的资产阶级“理论”。
    在这历史上极为短促的十五年里，捷克斯洛伐克经过了从资本主义向社会主义的过渡阶段，而目前正在执行捷克斯洛伐克共产党第十一次代表大会（1958年6月）所规定的建成社会主义的任务。
    现在，捷克斯洛伐克的经济已经是社会主义的经济了。在社会产品的生产中，社会主义成分已占95％，其余部分属于至今还存在的个体农民经济。在捷克斯洛伐克国民经济中占最重要地位的工业生产，比战前水平提高了近三倍，因此，捷克斯洛伐克共和国进入了世界工业最发达的国家的行列。同时，工业的结构也起了根本变化，生产资料的生产占全部工业产品的64％。机器制造业成为最重要的部门，其产量大约占工业总产量的30％。
    最能说明问题的，是把捷克斯洛伐克共和国战后的工业发展同资本主义相当发达的国家法国相比。如果以1937年的产量为一百，那么两国近几年来的发展情况如下：
    1937 1950 1953 1955 1958捷　100  143  210  243  326法　100  112  125  146  184
    这样的发展使捷克斯洛伐克在按人口平均产量方面赶上和超过法国。1958年主要产品的情况如下：
          煤（折成硬煤计算）    电力捷    　4449公斤            　1456度法　    1330公斤　            1317度
          钢　                  水泥捷　     409公斤　            305公斤法　     328公斤　            301公斤
  工业的发展提供了发展国民经济一切部门的可能，并且大大地促进了捷克斯洛伐克同社会主义国家的经济合作。十五年来由捷克斯洛伐克出国的三百套工厂的成套设备中，绝大部分都是运往社会主义国家的。从1950年至1959年，捷克斯洛伐克同中华人民共和国的贸易额增长了六倍半。
    经济发展的结果，使全体人民的物质文化生活水平不断提高。全民就业，提高工资和降低物价，使居民的实际收入不断增加。1959年的实际工资比1937年增长了46％。这就是说，工人和职员比1937年能够多购买差不多50％的商品。此外，在免费教育和免费医疗方面，在劳动者疾病和老年以及假期的保障方面，任何一个资本主义国家都无法同捷克斯洛伐克相比。1959年国家用于文化和社会保健方面的拨款，按人口平均计算，比1937年增加了十倍。
    目前，捷克斯洛伐克人民，在已经取得的成就的基础上，根据捷克斯洛伐克共产党第十一次代表大会所制定的建成社会主义的纲领，准备完成第三个五年计划（1961—1965年）的宏伟任务。在第三个五年计划期间，捷克斯洛伐克人民在完成建成社会主义的任务的同时，将为逐步过渡到共产主义创造物质的和文化的前提。
    首先，将努力进一步加强捷克斯洛伐克国家的工业性质。在三千一百二十亿克朗（捷币）的总投资额（比第二个五年计划多54％）中，工业投资占一千二百亿。工业生产将增长50％，比战前增长五倍，占国民经济的70％。最重要的部门仍旧是机器制造业，到1965年，一个月的产量将超过1937年全年的产量！发展机器制造业之所以是一个关键性的问题，还因为第三个五年计划中的一切任务的完成都有赖于劳动生产率大大提高（在工业中将提高40％）。而作到这一点，如果没有新的技术和生产过程的全盘机械化和自动化，是不可想像的。
    1959年的钢产量为六百一十万吨，1965年将增加到一千零五十万吨，或每人平均七百三十九公斤，也就是大大超过美国近年来的平均生产水平。某些发电机的设备能力将达到二十万瓩的巨型发电站的建设，将使电力生产由1959年的二百十九亿度增加到1965年的三百八十亿度。
    化学工业在国民经济各部门中将发展得最快。虽然十年来化学工业的生产已增加了两倍，但还不能满足国民经济的需要。新建的大型的化学工厂将促进塑料、人造肥料的生产，并掌握合成橡胶、合成酒精和肥料等的生产。苏联的石油将是发展我国化学工业的主要原料，为了把石油运往捷克斯洛伐克，已经开始铺设输油管道。
    在农业方面，首先将注意从内部巩固和进一步发展农业合作社和国营农场经济，并为使农业生产的集约化程度达到先进国家的水平创造前提。具有决定意义的任务是加强对于土壤的关心，特别是这将关系到广泛实现土壤改良措施和把所施矿物肥的平均量比现在提高一倍。在机械化农具的供应方面，到1965年按计划每三十六公顷耕地将有一台拖拉机，每一百五十八公顷的谷物作物地有一台谷物联合收割机，每十三公顷的青贮饲料地有一台青贮饲料联合收割机。总的说来，从1959年到1965年，农业总共将得到十二万四千多台拖拉机。农业方面的投资总额将达四百亿克朗，而1965年的农业产量，至少比1960年增加21％。
    我国东部——斯洛伐克的发展规模，在第三个五年计划中是最宏伟的，而它在资本主义时期，只不过是工业发达的捷克的农业附属品。现在，除去已经建成的完全改变了斯洛伐克面貌的数十座现代化工厂外，还将建设大型的工业联合企业。到1965年，斯洛伐克的工业生产将比1937年增长将近十六倍，并将达到1948年全捷克斯洛伐克的平均工业生产水平。到那时，斯洛伐克将达到足以代表工业发达的国家的一般水平。消灭斯洛伐克和捷克之间在经济和文化水平方面的差别，是按着列宁的原则解决民族问题的榜样，是具有巨大的国际意义的。
    捷克斯洛伐克是作为世界社会主义体系不可分割的一部分发展着，因此，在执行第三个五年计划的任务时，它还要完全依靠国际的社会主义分工。同苏联进行贸易，对于捷克斯洛伐克国民经济有计划发展的稳定性，具有重大意义。根据已有的协议，到1965年捷苏贸易总额将占捷克斯洛伐克对外贸易总额的40％。捷克斯洛伐克还将进一步加强同其他社会主义国家的合作，特别是在经济互助委员会范围内的合作。捷克斯洛伐克还将努力发展同非社会主义国家的贸易关系，从而促进不同社会制度的国家间的合作。
    发展国民经济的第三个五年计划的目的，首先在于进一步提高人民的生活水平。个人的消费量在此期间将增长30％。同时，将特别注意提高多子女家庭的生活水平。在第三个五年计划期间，人民将得到四十八万所设备完善的住宅，居住的情况将得到根本的改善，并将为完成捷共第十一次代表大会所提出的任务——在1970年以前保证每户有一所适当的住宅——提供可能性。到1965年每一万个居民将有十九个医疗站。学校的基本义务教育将由现在的八年延长到九年。
    捷克斯洛伐克的第三个五年计划，是发展先进的社会主义社会的经济计划，在国内和国际上都具有很大的意义。
    第三个五年计划将为实现党第十一次代表大会所制定的建成社会主义和逐步过渡到共产主义的宏大目标创造物质前提。（附图片）
