Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 27th: Seoul Dispatch: People from all walks of life in South Korea continue to wage an unyielding struggle against fascist rule and against the cruel system of exploitation.

According to a report by the Hapdong News Agency, all workers of the "Jayu Minbo" newspaper in Busan, which belongs to the Syngman Rhee group, began a strike on the 26th, demanding higher wages, strict adherence by the management to pay dates, and a guarantee of at least three days of rest per month for workers. Due to the workers' strike, the "Jayu Minbo" was unable to publish on the 26th.

According to a report by the Hapdong News Agency, on the 26th, more than forty student representatives from Chosun University, who had traveled a long distance from Gwangju to Seoul, staged a sit-in demonstration in the corridor in front of the office of the puppet "Minister of Education," resolutely demanding the resignation of Chosun University President Park Cheol-woong. Students at this school have been waging a struggle since May 2nd to drive out Park Cheol-woong, who colludes with the Syngman Rhee group and interferes with student freedom. Because Park Cheol-woong is still clinging to his position, the students sent representatives to Seoul to continue their struggle.

It is reported that peasants in various parts of South Korea are continuing to expose the atrocities of the Syngman Rhee group in massacring innocent people. On the morning of the 26th, thirty-one family members of those killed in Seokbong-ri, Sanbuk-myeon, Mungyeong-gun, Gyeongsangbuk-do, demanded the immediate punishment of the masterminds and murderers of the massacre that took place there on December 24, 1949. According to these family members, the Syngman Rhee group killed eighty-six innocent people in the area at that time, including forty-one women, eleven elementary school students, and twelve children under the age of twelve.

According to a report by the Hapdong News Agency, more than five hundred merchants from Nam Moon Market and Central Market in Jeonju held a demonstration again at 11:00 a.m. on the 26th. They stormed into the office of the Jeonju "Tax Office" and continued their struggle until 4:00 p.m. They demanded the punishment of bad tax collectors and the abolition of the "poll tax."

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 27th: According to a report by the Korean Central News Agency on the 25th, citing news from Seoul, the United States and the Syngman Rhee group massacred more than one million innocent South Korean people in the approximately fourteen months after the United States launched the war of aggression in Korea on June 25, 1950.

Since the massacre crimes committed by the United States and the Syngman Rhee group in Geochang, Hamyang, Sancheong, Tongyeong, Chungmu, Suncheon, and Imsil were exposed, large-scale massacre incidents have been revealed one after another in various parts of South Korea.

The news said that when the Korean War broke out, the United States and the Syngman Rhee group massacred 8,644 people in Daejeon, Chungcheongnam-do, and 4,000 people each in Jeonju, Jeollabuk-do, and Gwangju, Jeollanam-do.

In other parts of South Korea, the United States and the Syngman Rhee group massacred many patriots and innocent people under the charge of being "communists" or "communist sympathizers." In Dalseong, Gyeongsangbuk-do alone, six hundred citizens were killed as "communists."

The news said that in January 1951, more than four hundred residents of Yeochi-myeon, Jangheung-gun, Jeollanam-do, were killed for disobeying police orders, and more than 2,700 houses there were burned down.

A person who lost his family revealed on the 24th that in the past two and a half years, in Yeongdeok-gun, Gyeongsangbuk-do, more than forty residents were beaten to death or shot by puppet police on charges of being "communists" or "communist sympathizers."

The news said that in many parts of South Korea, the calls for punishing murderers are rising day by day. Representatives of residents from Geochang-gun and Hamyang-gun went to Seoul on May 23rd, strongly demanding that the puppet National Assembly arrest and punish the main perpetrators of the massacre of innocent residents of South Korea.

    新华社平壤27日电　汉城消息：南朝鲜各界人民继续不屈不挠地展开反对法西斯统治、反对残酷的剥削制度的斗争。
    据合同通讯社报道，釜山市李承晚集团的“自由民报”报社的全体工人从26日开始罢工，要求提高工资，要求资方严格遵守发工资的日期，并保证工人每月有三天以上的休息日等。由于工人们的罢工，26日这一天“自由民报”未能出版。
    据合同通讯社报道，26日这天，从光州远途跋涉来到汉城的四十多名朝鲜大学的学生代表，在傀儡“文教部长官”的办公室前的走廊上进行静坐示威，坚决要求朝鲜大学的校长朴哲雄下台。这个学校的学生从5月2日就展开了驱逐同李承晚集团勾结、干涉学生自由的朴哲雄出校的斗争。由于朴哲雄至今仍赖在学校里不走，学生们又派代表到汉城继续进行斗争。
    据报道，南朝鲜各地的农民仍在继续揭露李承晚集团屠杀无辜人民的暴行。庆尚北道闻庆郡山北面石凤里三十一名被杀害者的家属，在26日上午要求立即惩办1949年12月24日在那里进行大屠杀的主谋者和杀人凶手。据这些死者家属们揭露，当时，李承晚集团曾在当地杀害了八十六名无辜人民。其中包括四十一名妇女、十一名上小学的学生、十二名不到十二岁的儿童。
    据合同通讯社报道，全州市南门市场和中央市场的五百多名商人，在26日上午十一时又举行示威。他们冲进了全州“税务署”的办公室，一直到下午四时还在进行斗争。他们提出了惩办坏蛋收税员、废除“人头税”等要求。
    新华社平壤27日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社25日援引汉城的消息报道，在美国1950年6月25日在朝鲜发动侵略战争以后的大约十四个月中，美国和李承晚集团屠杀了一百多万无辜的南朝鲜人民。
    自美国和李承晚集团在居昌、咸阳、山清、统营、忠武、顺川和任实等地进行的屠杀罪行被揭露以后，大规模屠杀的事件接二连三地在南朝鲜各地被揭露了出来。
    消息说，在朝鲜战争爆发的时候，美国和李承晚集团就在忠清南道的大田屠杀了八千六百四十四个人，在全罗北道的全州和全罗南道的光州分别屠杀了四千个人。
    在南朝鲜的其他地方，美国和李承晚集团以“共产党”或“共产党同情者”的罪名屠杀了很多爱国者和无辜人民。单是在庆尚北道的达成，就有六百个公民被当作“共产党人”而杀死。
    消息说，在1951年1月，全罗南道长兴郡余致面的四百多个居民由于没有服从警察的命令而被杀死，那里的二千七百多幢房屋被烧毁。
    一个失去家庭的人24日揭露，在过去两年半中间，在庆尚北道荣德郡，有四十多个居民被傀儡警察以“共产党”或“共产党同情者”的罪名给打死或枪杀。
    消息说，在南朝鲜的很多地方，人民要求惩办杀人犯的呼声正在日益高涨。居昌郡和咸阳郡的居民代表曾在5月23日到汉城去，强烈要求傀儡国会逮捕和惩办屠杀南朝鲜无辜居民的主犯。
