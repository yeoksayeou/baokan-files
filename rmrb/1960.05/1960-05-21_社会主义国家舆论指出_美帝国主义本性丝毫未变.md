Xinhua News Agency, May 20th—Socialist countries' newspapers continued to publish commentaries on the 18th and 19th, resolutely supporting the statement made by Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers Khrushchev at the preparatory meeting of the four-power summit, and unanimously condemning the United States for sabotaging the summit conference.

    The Albanian "People's Voice" said on the 18th that Khrushchev's statement completely exposed the anti-Soviet robber policy of the American ruling clique. Time has shown that the sweet talk of the American ruling clique about peace is hypocritical, and its purpose is to deceive the people and numb their vigilance.
    The Bulgarian "Workers' Cause" said on the 19th that the Washington government's recent perfidious actions once again exposed the true face of the U.S. imperialist elements and their aggressive policies.
    "Fatherland Front" pointed out that the most responsible national leaders of the United States not only defended their unscrupulous robbery, but also openly regarded this behavior as the official national policy of the United States. This cannot but arouse the vigilance of the people of all countries, and they can no longer remain silent and compromising! The truth that has been repeated many times in history is that silence and compromise with aggressive behavior will only make the aggressor more ambitious.
    The East German "Neues Deutschland" said in its editorial on the 19th that the Soviet Union's demands were not only necessary for the Soviet Union's self-esteem and to ensure the integrity of Soviet sovereignty, but also absolutely indispensable for maintaining the security of all countries. The Soviet Union's demands mean that socialist countries must defend international law and protect it from destruction by international bandits.
    The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" said in an editorial entitled "The Responsibility for Sabotaging the Summit Conference Lies Entirely with the U.S. Imperialists": "Due to the U.S. imperialists' ferocious aggressive acts, the Paris Four-Power Summit Conference was aborted before it even began. The U.S. imperialists not only did not apologize for the aggressive act of their special military aircraft intruding into Soviet airspace, but also actively sought to justify this gangster behavior.
    The editorial believes that these facts prove that the nature of U.S. imperialism has not changed in the slightest. It also proves that the more U.S. imperialism is thwarted everywhere in the world, the more frantically it struggles as it approaches its demise. At the same time, it tells all people that they must not have any illusions about U.S. imperialism and must further heighten their vigilance."
    The Mongolian "Truth" newspaper said in its editorial on the 19th that holding a summit conference in an atmosphere already poisoned by the United States would be deceiving the people.

### 社会主义国家舆论指出  美帝国主义本性丝毫未变

    社会主义国家舆论指出
    美帝国主义本性丝毫未变
    据新华社20日讯　社会主义国家的报纸在18、19两日继续发表评论，坚决支持苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在四国首脑会议预备会议上所发表的声明，并一致谴责美国破坏首脑会议的罪行。
    阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”18日说，赫鲁晓夫的声明完全揭穿了美国统治集团的反对苏联的强盗政策。时间说明了美国统治集团所说的关于和平的好听的话都是虚伪的，其目的在于欺骗人民和麻痹人民的警惕性。
    保加利亚“工人事业报”19日说，华盛顿政府的最近的背信弃义行动再次暴露了美帝国主义分子的真面目及其侵略政策。
    “祖国阵线报”指出，美国最负责的国家领导人不仅为肆无忌惮的强盗行为辩解，而且公然把这种行为作为美国的正式国家政策。这确实不能不引起各国人民的戒备，使他们不能再保持沉默和调和了，不能！历史上多次重复的真理是：对侵略行为的沉默和妥协只能使侵略者野心更大。
    德意志民主共和国“新德意志报”在19日的社论中说，苏联的要求不仅对于苏联的自尊和保证苏联的主权完整说来是必要的，而且对于维持各国的安全来说也是绝对不可缺少的。苏联的要求意味着，社会主义国家要保卫国际法，使之不受国际强盗的破坏。
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”在题为“破坏首脑会议的责任完全在于美帝国主义者”的社论中说：“由于美帝国主义者的凶恶的侵略行为，巴黎四国首脑会议没有开会就流产。美帝国主义者不仅不对它的特别军用飞机侵入苏联领空的侵略行为谢罪，反而积极地要把这一强盗行为正当化起来。
    社论认为这些事实证明了美帝国主义的本性丝毫没有改变。也证明了在世界到处碰壁的美帝国主义越临近灭亡，就越发疯狂挣扎。同时也告诉一切人们，对美帝国主义不能有任何幻想，必须进一步提高警惕。”
    蒙古“真理报”19日的社论指出，如果在已经被美国毒化了的气氛中举行首脑会议，就是欺骗人民。
