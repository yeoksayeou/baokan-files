Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 14th: Seoul News: On May 13th, slogans opposing the Heo Jeong group's collusion with Japan appeared on the streets of Seoul. This reflects the strong sentiment of the South Korean people, who suffered under the iron heel of Japanese imperialism for forty years, against the Heo Jeong group colluding with Japanese militarism under the direction of American imperialism.

It is reported that the slogans read: "We don't want Japanese goods imported!" "It's too early to establish relations with Japan!" These slogans, written in red ink, were signed by the "Patriotic Student League."

After Heo Jeong replaced Syngman Rhee on April 27th, the United States has been trying to rope Japan into a relationship with this puppet group it supports in South Korea, in order to realize the American plan to piece together a Northeast Asian aggressive military alliance.

It is also reported that the hypocrisy of the so-called "constitutional amendment" drafted by the Heo Jeong group under American direction to deceive the South Korean people has also been exposed and criticized by some South Korean newspapers. The "Hankook Ilbo" said in an editorial on the 12th, "Will South Korean citizens and student organizations approve a constitutional amendment that can restrict the people's various freedoms (including freedom of learning...)?". The "Segye Ilbo" said on the same day that according to the proposed "constitutional amendment", "non-communist, non-conservative parties are likely to be persecuted."

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 14th: Seoul News: After the farmers of Sinwon Township, Geochang County, Gyeongsangnam-do Province, angrily executed Park Young-bo, the henchman of the "Geochang Massacre," they continued to unite in resistance to the suppression by the South Korean puppet authorities.

After more than seventy family members of the victims of the "Geochang Massacre" executed Park Young-bo on the evening of the 11th, the South Korean puppet authorities sent a large number of military police to suppress them, arresting more than thirty family members of the victims in Daehyeon-ri, Sinwon Township, and subjecting them to "severe torture" to track down the "masterminds" behind the execution of Park Young-bo.

The puppet authorities' suppression further aroused the anger of the local residents, who unanimously declared that the execution of Park Young-bo was "an outburst of public sentiment." Everyone said they were the "mastermind." According to the World News Agency, the anti-government sentiment of the local residents is very high. The puppet police sent to the area said that if a few people were "punished," more than a thousand family members of the victims of the "Geochang Massacre" might rise up in demonstrations and riots.

This newspaper comprehensively reports: According to Xinhua News Agency, the struggle launched by students in various parts of South Korea to expel American-Syngman Rhee special agents and pro-government elements from schools and to strive for democracy and freedom is still continuing.

According to statistics from the South Korean puppet authorities' "Ministry of Education," quoted by the World News Agency, since the Seoul people held a demonstration of more than 40,000 people on April 19th, up to May 13th, students from 116 colleges (excluding comprehensive universities) and middle schools have held demonstrations and strikes, demanding that principals, supervisors, and pro-government elements who act as American-Syngman Rhee special agents get out of schools. As of now, students from 35 colleges and middle schools are continuing to persist in their strikes.

The World News Agency also reported that 200 students held a demonstration in Daegu City today. They were students who commuted between Yeongcheon and Daegu by train. They demanded improvements to the facilities on the train. However, the puppet authorities dispatched military police to suppress the students.

    南朝鲜人民再接再厉坚持斗争
    汉城出现大量反对新傀儡许政的标语　居昌郡农民团结一致
    反抗军警镇压  各地学生坚决驱逐美李特务分子出校
    新华社平壤14日电　汉城消息：汉城的街道上13日出现了反对许政集团同日本勾结的标语。这反映了曾经遭受日本帝国主义四十年铁蹄蹂躏的南朝鲜人民强烈反对许政集团在美帝国主义指使下同日本军国主义勾结的情绪。
    据报道，标语上写着“我们不要日本货进口！”“同日本建立关系还嫌太早！”等口号。这些用红墨水书写的标语是由“爱国学生同盟”署名的。
    在许政4月27日代替李承晚上台后，美国就竭力拉拢日本同它在南朝鲜扶植的这个傀儡集团之间的关系，以便实现美国拼凑东北亚侵略军事同盟的计划。
    另悉，许政集团在美国指使下为欺骗南朝鲜人民而拟订的所谓“宪法修正案”的虚伪性也遭到某些南朝鲜报纸的揭露和抨击。“韩国日报”12日在社论里说，南朝鲜的“公民和学生会赞成将能够限制人民的种种自由（包括学习自由……）的宪法修正案吗？”“世界日报”同一天说，根据拟议中的“宪法修正案”，“非共产党的非保守派政党大概都要受迫害”。
    新华社平壤14日电　汉城消息：南朝鲜庆尚南道居昌郡新院面的农民愤怒地亲手惩办了制造“居昌惨案”的帮凶伪面长朴英甫以后，继续团结一致反抗南朝鲜傀儡当局的镇压。
    在11日晚上“居昌惨案”遭惨杀者的家属七十多名处死了朴英甫以后，南朝鲜傀儡当局派了大批军警前往镇压，把新院面大岘里的三十多名被惨杀者的家属逮捕起来，进行“严刑拷问”，要追查处死朴英甫的“主谋者”。
    傀儡当局的镇压更使当地居民群情激愤，他们一致宣称，处死朴英甫是“公众感情的爆发”。大家都说自己是“主谋者”。据世界通讯社报道，当地居民反抗的情绪十分高涨，派到当地去的伪警察说，如果“处罚”几个人的话，“居昌惨案”被惨杀者的家属一千多人可能都起来示威和暴动。
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯　南朝鲜各地学生展开的驱逐美李特务和御用分子出校、争取民主和自由的斗争，仍在继续进行。
    据世界通讯社引用南朝鲜傀儡当局“文教部”的统计材料说，自4月19日汉城人民举行四万多人的示威斗争以来，到5月13日为止，仅高等学校（不包括综合性大学）和中学就有一百一十六所学校的学生举行示威、罢课斗争，要充当美李特务的校长、校监和御用分子滚出学校。到目前为止，还有三十五所高等学校和中学的学生在继续坚持罢课。
    世界通讯社还报道，今天大丘市有二百名学生举行示威。他们是在永川—大丘之间乘火车走读的学生。他们要求改善列车上的设备。但是，傀儡当局竟出动宪兵镇压学生。
