    Xinhua News Agency, 8th: Washington Dispatch: Under the weight of irrefutable evidence, the U.S. State Department was forced to issue a statement on the evening of the 7th, admitting that the U.S. plane's intrusion into Soviet territory was for espionage activities.
    The statement said: "It appears that in an effort to obtain information currently hidden behind the Iron Curtain, an unarmed U-2 aircraft may have flown over Soviet territory."
    However, the statement denied that the U.S. government was aware, stating, "As far as the authorities in Washington are concerned, no authorization was given for the kind of flight that Khrushchev spoke of."
    Since the crime of aggression is inescapable, the U.S. State Department is shamelessly adopting a rogue attitude, clamoring brazenly that "due to the current world situation, all countries are engaged in intelligence-gathering activities." It even turned around and accused the Soviet Union of "being no laggard" in this regard.
    The U.S. State Department also used robber logic to insist that this act of aggression was a "legitimate defense measure." It even cited an unprecedented reason, saying it was because the Soviet Union was "excessively secretive."
    The statement said that the necessity for "such activities as legitimate defense measures is increased by the extreme secrecy practiced by the Soviet Union compared to the free world."
    The U.S. State Department also sophistically portrayed the U.S. act of aggression as being for the purpose of defending against "sudden attacks," stating shamelessly that because the Soviet Union did not agree to the U.S. plan to open Soviet airspace under the pretext of defending against sudden attacks, but actually for the purpose of collecting intelligence, the U.S. sent planes to invade the Soviet Union for espionage activities.
    After Soviet Premier Khrushchev presented further conclusive evidence at the Soviet Supreme Soviet meeting on the 7th regarding the U.S. Air Force's intrusion into Soviet airspace for espionage activities, the U.S. authorities were caught off guard and extremely embarrassed. Upon receiving the news, White House Press Secretary Hagerty immediately flew to Gettysburg to report to U.S. President Eisenhower, who was on vacation. Secretary of State Herter immediately convened a day-long meeting with Under Secretary Dillon, Merchant, Special Advisor on Soviet Affairs Bohlen, Assistant Secretary of State Kohler, and other senior officials, after which the State Department issued the aforementioned statement.
    White, the State Department's press officer who read out the statement, contradicted himself repeatedly and became red-faced and embarrassed when answering reporters' questions. White dared not answer whether U.S. military aircraft had crossed the Soviet border in the past four years, as well as many other questions raised by reporters.

### 罪证确凿  无法抵赖  美国务院承认收集情报

    罪证确凿  无法抵赖
    美国务院承认收集情报
    据新华社8日讯　华盛顿消息：在人赃俱获无可抵赖的情况下，美国国务院7日晚被迫发表声明，承认美国飞机侵入苏联国境是进行间谍活动。
    声明说：“看来为了竭力获得目前藏在铁幕后的情报，一架没有武装的U—2型飞机大概曾飞越苏联领土”。
    但是声明抵赖美国政府并不知情，它说，“就华盛顿当局来说，并没有授权进行赫鲁晓夫所说的那种飞行”。
    由于侵略罪行无可逃脱，美国国务院竟然大耍流氓态度，无耻地叫嚷，“由于目前世界的情况，所有的国家都在进行搜集情报的活动”。它还反咬一口，说苏联“也不落后”。
    美国国务院还根据强盗逻辑硬说这种侵略行为是“正当的国防措施”。它还举出旷古未闻的理由，说这是因为苏联“过分保密”。
    声明说，美国“这种活动作为正当的国防措施的必要性由于苏联的同自由世界比起来极为过分的保密作法而有所增加”。
    美国国务院还强词夺理地把美国的侵略行为说做是为了防御“突然袭击”，声明并无耻地提出，因为苏联不同意美国借口防御突然袭击、实际是为了收集情报而提出的开放苏联领空的计划，所以美国就派飞机侵入苏联进行间谍活动。
    苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫7日在苏联最高苏维埃会议上进一步举出美国空军侵入苏联进行间谍活动的确凿证据后，美国当局手忙脚乱、狼狈万分。白宫新闻秘书哈格蒂在接到这消息后立即乘飞机到葛底斯堡向正在休假的美国总统艾森豪威尔报告。国务卿赫脱马上召集副国务卿狄龙、麦钱特、苏联事务特别顾问波伦、助理国务卿科勒以及其他一些高级官员开了一整天的会议，会后由国务院发表了上述声明。
    宣读这份声明的国务院新闻发布官怀特在回答记者问题时矛盾百出，面红耳赤，狼狈不堪。怀特不敢回答美国军用飞机过去四年曾否越过苏联边境以及记者们提出的其他许多问题。
