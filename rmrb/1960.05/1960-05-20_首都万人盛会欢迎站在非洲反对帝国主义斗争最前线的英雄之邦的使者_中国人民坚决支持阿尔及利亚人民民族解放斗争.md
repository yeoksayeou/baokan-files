Xinhua News Agency, May 19th: Beijing held a grand rally of over ten thousand people from all walks of life this afternoon at the Great Hall of the People to warmly welcome the heroic envoys from the heroic nation—the delegation of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria headed by Vice Premier Belkacem Krim.

Peng Zhen, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Mayor of Beijing, expressed the firm support of the entire Chinese people for the Algerian people's struggle on behalf of all the Chinese people at the meeting. He also presented a red banner with golden characters to Vice Premier Krim Belkacem on behalf of the people of the capital. The banner read: "We, all 650 million people of China, fully sympathize with and support the heroic struggle of the Algerian people against imperialism, against colonialism, and for national independence. We wish the Algerian national liberation struggle victory!"

At 3:25 PM, Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Krim Belkacem, accompanied by Vice Premier He Long, Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi, Peng Zhen, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Mayor of Beijing, Liu Changsheng, President of the Chinese-African People's Friendship Association, Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee, and others, stepped onto the rostrum. At this moment, thunderous applause and welcoming music resounded in the Great Hall of the People, warmly welcoming the distinguished Algerian guests. A group of children from the capital went on stage to present flowers to the distinguished guests.

The rally began with the band playing the national anthems of Algeria and China. Peng Zhen, Mayor of Beijing, delivered a welcome speech first.

In his welcome speech, Peng Zhen said that the people of China and the people of Algeria support and encourage each other in the common struggle against imperialist aggression. The Chinese people care about and support the struggle of their Algerian brothers and sisters who are striving for liberation, just as they care about their own cause. We regard the victory of the Algerian people as our own victory, and we are sincerely happy for every progress made by the Algerian people in their struggle.

He emphasized that the heroic, united, and unified Algerian people will surely achieve final and complete victory after a long period of struggle.

These remarks by Peng Zhen aroused warm applause from the audience.

In his speech, Peng Zhen also severely condemned US imperialism for undermining the Four-Power Summit. He said that the Four-Power Government Summit was buried by US imperialists just as it was about to be held. This once again exposed the true face of US imperialism as actively preparing for a war of aggression, and also exposed that Eisenhower is by no means a "peace envoy," but a thorough and utter war-monger.

He said that we must not have any unrealistic illusions about imperialism, especially US imperialism. The imperialists, headed by the United States, will never change their nature.

Peng Zhen emphasized that the Chinese people fully support the series of solemn measures taken by the Soviet government in recent times against the provocative crimes of US imperialism. The Chinese people are determined to contribute all their strength, together with the socialist camp countries and all peace-loving people in the world, to wage unremitting struggle for the sacred cause of defending peace and opposing the forces of imperialist war.

Peng Zhen expressed his belief that the people of all countries in the world will further unite, form a broad united front against US imperialism, and carry out a heroic struggle.

In his speech, Peng Zhen warmly praised the heroic Algerian people for their five years of tenacious liberation war, and praised the surging storm of struggle against imperialism that has risen everywhere in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. He said that relying on the unity and struggle of the people, imperialism and their lackeys can certainly be defeated, and lasting world peace can be achieved.

Finally, amidst thunderous applause, he shouted: "Long live the militant friendship between the Chinese and Algerian people!" "Long live the national democratic revolutionary movements of Asia, Africa, and Latin America!"

Vice Premier Krim Belkacem spoke amidst prolonged and enthusiastic applause. In his speech, he expressed the deep friendship of the Algerian people towards the Chinese government, the Chinese people, and the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong.

He said that the Algerian people are 20,000 kilometers away from here, but their courageous struggle for national independence and freedom has resonated strongly in New China. The Algerian people are proud to have the sympathy and friendship of the people of a country that is determined to deal with any aggressor.

Speaking of the Algerian people's armed struggle against French colonialism, he said that for five and a half years, the Algerian people have been waging a turbulent struggle against an enemy that is superior in numbers and equipment. He strongly condemned the North Atlantic Group, especially US imperialism, for supporting the French colonialists in all aspects of their war of aggression in Algeria, and he denounced the French colonialists for launching a frenzied offensive against unarmed civilians, women, children, and the elderly. He said that the Algerian people resolutely oppose the French colonialists and the imperialist groups that support them.

Vice Premier Belkacem said that although the Algerian people have sacrificed one million people in their struggle against the colonialists, and although the struggle is arduous, the Algerian people are confident in the victorious outcome of the battle because of the correctness of their rights and cause, and they are determined to carry the struggle through to the end until they achieve national independence.

As soon as he finished speaking, the entire audience burst into thunderous applause.

The Vice Premier said that in this struggle, the sympathy and support of all justice-loving and freedom-loving people encourages the Algerian people. He said that the Algerian people especially cherish the sympathy and support of the Chinese people. He said that they will faithfully convey the friendship gained from their visit to China to the Algerian people.

After the speech, Mayor Peng Zhen presented a flag and gifts to Vice Premier Krim Belkacem on behalf of the people of the capital. When Vice Premier Krim Belkacem took the red banner with golden characters from Mayor Peng Zhen, he shook hands warmly with Mayor Peng Zhen. At this moment, everyone stood up, and the applause in the hall was thunderous and lasting.

Also present at the meeting were Vice Ministers of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, Luo Guibo, and Ji Pengfei, Vice Presidents of the Chinese-African People's Friendship Association Nan Hanchen and Zhang Tiesheng, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee Li Dequan, Second Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CPC Liu Ren, Vice Mayors of Beijing Wan Li, Feng Jiping, Wu Han, Jia Tingsan, Le Songsheng, and heads of various departments in Beijing.

African guests currently visiting Beijing and African students in China were also invited to attend today's meeting.

After the meeting, artists from the capital performed wonderful art programs.

    克里姆·贝勒卡塞姆副总理说，阿尔及利亚人民特别珍视中国人民的支持，决心把反殖民主义斗争进行到底
    新华社19日讯　北京各界一万多人今天下午在人民大会堂举行盛大集会，热烈欢迎来自英雄之邦的英雄使者——以贝勒卡塞姆副总理为首的阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团。
    中共中央政治局委员、北京市市长彭真在会上以全中国人民的名义，表示坚决支持阿尔及利亚人民的斗争。他并代表首都人民将一面红色金字的锦旗赠送给克里姆·贝勒卡塞姆副总理，锦旗上写着：“我们全中国六亿五千万人民完全同情和支持阿尔及利亚人民反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义、争取民族独立的英勇斗争，祝阿尔及利亚民族解放斗争胜利！”
    三点二十五分，克里姆·贝勒卡塞姆副总理兼外交部长，由贺龙副总理，陈毅副总理兼外交部长，中共中央政治局委员、北京市市长彭真，中国非洲人民友好协会会长刘长胜，中国亚非团结委员会主席廖承志等陪同步上主席台。这时，人民大会堂里响起了暴风雨般的掌声和欢迎的乐曲，热烈欢迎阿尔及利亚的贵宾们。首都一群少年儿童登台向贵宾们献了鲜花。
    大会在乐队高奏阿尔及利亚、中国两国国歌声中开始。北京市市长彭真首先致欢迎词。
    彭真在致欢迎词时说，我国人民和阿尔及利亚人民，在反对帝国主义侵略的共同斗争中，是互相支持、互相鼓舞的。中国人民像关心自己的事业一样，关心和支持正在争取解放的阿尔及利亚兄弟姊妹们的斗争。我们把阿尔及利亚人民的胜利作为自己的胜利，为阿尔及利亚人民在斗争中所取得的每一个进展感到衷心的喜悦。
    他强调，英雄的全国团结一致的阿尔及利亚人民，经过长期的斗争以后，一定能够取得最后的彻底的胜利。
    彭真的这些讲话，激起全场热烈的掌声。
    彭真在讲话中还严厉谴责了美帝国主义破坏四国首脑会议。他说，四国政府首脑会议在即将举行的时候，就被美帝国主义者葬送了。这再一次暴露了美帝国主义积极准备侵略战争的真面目，也暴露了艾森豪威尔决不是什么“和平使者”，而是地地道道的战争贩子。
    他说，我们对帝国主义特别是美帝国主义绝不能抱有任何不切实际的幻想。以美国为首的帝国主义者决不会改变它的本性。
    彭真强调说，中国人民完全支持苏联政府在最近时期对美帝国主义的挑衅罪行所采取的一系列的严正措施。中国人民决心贡献自己的一切力量，同社会主义阵营各国一起，同全世界所有爱好和平的人民一起，为了保卫和平、反对帝国主义战争势力的神圣事业，进行不懈的斗争。
    彭真表示相信：全世界各国人民一定会进一步团结起来，结成广泛的反对美帝国主义的统一战线，进行英勇的斗争。
    彭真在讲话中热烈地赞扬了英雄的阿尔及利亚人民顽强地坚持了五年的解放战争，赞扬了亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲到处兴起的反对帝国主义的汹涌澎湃斗争风暴。他说，依靠人民的团结和斗争，一定能够战胜帝国主义和它们的走狗，取得世界的持久和平。
    他最后在暴风雨般的掌声中高呼：“中国和阿尔及利亚人民的战斗友谊万岁！”“亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族民主革命运动万岁！”
    克里姆·贝勒卡塞姆副总理在长时间的热烈掌声中讲话。他在讲话中表达了阿尔及利亚人民对中国政府、中国人民和中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席的深厚友谊。
    他说，阿尔及利亚人民距离这里有二万公里，但是他们为争取民族独立和自由而勇敢进行的斗争，在新中国却有着强烈的反响。中国人民有着对付任何侵略者的决心，阿尔及利亚人民为有这样一个国家的人民的同情和友谊感到自豪。
    讲到阿尔及利亚人民对法国殖民主义者进行的武装斗争时，他说，五年半以来，阿尔及利亚人民同在数量上和武器装备上占优势的敌人进行着汹涌澎湃的斗争。他强烈谴责北大西洋集团尤其是美帝国主义，在各方面支持法国殖民主义者在阿尔及利亚进行侵略战争，他斥责法国殖民主义者向手无寸铁的平民、妇女、儿童和老人展开疯狂的进攻。他说，阿尔及利亚人民坚决反对法国殖民主义者和支持它的帝国主义集团。
    贝勒卡塞姆副总理说，尽管阿尔及利亚人民为反对殖民主义者已牺牲了一百万人，尽管斗争是艰巨的，但是由于他们的权利和事业的正确性，阿尔及利亚人民对战斗的胜利结局是有信心的，他们决心把斗争进行到底，直到取得民族独立为止。
    他的这些话音刚落，全场立即响起了暴风骤雨般的掌声。
    这位副总理说，在这场斗争中，一切爱好正义和自由人民的同情和支持，鼓舞着阿尔及利亚人民。他说，阿尔及利亚人民特别珍视中国人民的同情和支持。他表示他们将把访问中国获得的友谊，忠实地转达给阿尔及利亚人民。
    讲话以后，彭真市长代表首都人民向克里姆·贝勒卡塞姆副总理赠旗和赠礼。当克里姆·贝勒卡塞姆副总理从彭真市长手中接过红底金字的锦旗后，和彭真市长热烈握手。这时，全体起立，大厅里掌声雷动，经久不息。
    出席大会的还有外交部副部长章汉夫、罗贵波、姬鹏飞，中国非洲人民友好协会副会长南汉宸、张铁生，中国亚非团结委员会副主席李德全，中共北京市委第二书记刘仁，北京市副市长万里、冯基平、吴晗、贾庭三、乐松生和北京市各方面的负责人等。
    正在北京访问的非洲外宾和非洲各国在我国的留学生也应邀出席了今天的大会。
