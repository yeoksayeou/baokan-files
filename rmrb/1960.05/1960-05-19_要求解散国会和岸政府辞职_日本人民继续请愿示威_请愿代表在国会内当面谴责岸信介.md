Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 18th: The nationwide mass movement of the Japanese people submitting petitions to the Diet, expressing opposition to the Diet passing the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, is in full swing. Today, people from all walks of life continued to submit petitions to the Diet, demanding that the Diet not ratify the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," and also demanding the dissolution of the Diet and the passage of a resolution of no confidence in the Nobusuke Kishi government.

Members of the Japan Teachers Union and approximately two thousand government employees held a rally on the grounds behind the Diet Building before submitting their petitions to the Diet today. Tanaka Toshio, Chairman of the National Movement Committee of the Socialist Party, and Iwama Masao, Communist Party Senator, both emphasized at the rally the importance of petitioning in the tense situation surrounding the "Security Treaty" issue.

Tanaka Toshio said that the situation, both domestically and internationally, is increasingly unfavorable to the Nobusuke Kishi group. The anti-mainstream faction within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party is also very wavering. They have two paths before them: either support the "Security Treaty," thereby proving themselves to be servants of the United States; or oppose the "Security Treaty," thereby becoming patriots.

Referring to the situation in Paris, Tanaka Toshio said that the United States was the one that sabotaged the scheduled summit talks because its planes were conducting intelligence-gathering flights over the Soviet Union. Tanaka Toshio emphasized, "This foreshadows the disaster that the new (Japan-U.S. Security) Treaty will bring." We must immediately withdraw all U-2 jets from Japan.

Iwama Masao revealed that the Japanese government is attempting to send a large number of police officers into the Diet Building to facilitate the passage of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" in the Diet and forcibly extend the current Diet session. Iwama called on workers to rise up more resolutely at this critical juncture and stand at the forefront of the struggle of the entire Japanese people.

At the same time, one hundred and fifty representatives from Gunma Prefecture submitted twenty thousand petitions to the Japanese Diet.

Today, shortly after 1:00 PM, eleven representatives of the Japanese "Security Treaty Criticism Association," including Aono Suekichi, Matsuoka Yoko, and Sata Ineko, went to the Diet Minister's Office to reason with Nobusuke Kishi, demanding the abolition of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." During the meeting, Matsuoka Yoko condemned Nobusuke Kishi for "not having the enthusiasm to open a path to peace."

Aono Suekichi said to Nobusuke Kishi that the Japanese people's discussions have greatly developed. Therefore, he hoped to immediately halt the Diet's ratification of the "Security Treaty," which is the opinion of the entire nation.

These eleven representatives also met with the Speaker of the Japanese House of Representatives, Kiyose Ichiro, demanding that the authorities not act recklessly and requesting that they stop ratifying the "Security Treaty."

The Human Loving Association, composed of followers of the Japanese Omoto religion (a branch of Japanese Shinto), held a national congress in Tokyo today. Eighty representatives from all over Japan who participated in the congress also went to the Diet to submit one hundred thousand petitions collected last week.

Tonight, fifty activists of the Buddhist Peace Association in Japan held a gathering in Tokyo to oppose the Diet's passage of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." They decided to step up their activities to enable as many Buddhists as possible to participate in the movement against this treaty.

The resolution passed at today's meeting emphasized that Buddhists cannot remain silent when those whose hands are stained with the blood of the aggressive war against China forcibly revise the "Security Treaty." Six hundred young and elderly women gathered in Takamatsu City, Kagawa Prefecture, on May 14th to oppose the Diet's ratification of the "Security Treaty." This was the first time that a mass rally against the "Security Treaty" composed entirely of women was held in this prefecture.

    要求解散国会和岸政府辞职 
    日本人民继续请愿示威
    请愿代表在国会内当面谴责岸信介
    据新华社18日讯　东京消息：日本人民向国会递交请愿书、表示反对国会通过日美军事同盟条约的全民性群众运动正方兴未艾。今天各阶层人士继续向国会递交请愿书，要求国会不要批准新日美“安全条约”，并且要求解散国会和通过不信任岸信介政府的决议。
    日本教职员工会的会员和约二千名政府机关雇员等今天到国会递交请愿书之前，在国会大厦后面的场地上举行了大会。社会党国民运动委员会委员长田中稔男和共产党参议员岩间正男在大会上都强调指出在环绕着“安全条约”问题的紧张局势中举行请愿的重要意义。
    田中稔男说，日本国内外的形势对岸信介集团日益不利。执政的自由民主党内部的反主流派也十分游移。他们面前有两条路：要么支持“安全条约”从而证明自己是美国的奴仆；要么反对“安全条约”从而成为爱国者。
    田中稔男在谈到巴黎所发生的情况时说，破坏预定举行的最高级会谈的是美国，因为它的飞机在苏联上空进行收集谍报的飞行。田中稔男强调指出，“这预示新（日美安全）条约将带来的灾难”。我们必须立即使所有的U—2型喷气机撤出日本。
    岩间正男揭露，日本政府企图派大批警察到国会大厦中来促使新日美“安全条约”在国会通过和强行延长目前国会的会期。岩间号召工人在这个关头要更坚决地奋起，站在日本全体人民斗争的前列。
    与此同时，群马县的一百五十名代表向日本国会递交了两万份请愿书。
    今天下午一点多钟，日本“安全条约批判会”的代表青野季吉、松冈洋子、佐多稻子等十一人到国会大臣室，找岸信介讲理，要求废除新日美“安全条约”。双方会见时，松冈洋子谴责岸信介“没有打开通往和平道路的热情”。
      青野季吉对岸信介说，日本国民的议论，有了很大的发展。因此，希望即刻停止国会对“安全条约”的批准，这是全体国民的意见。
    这十一位代表还会见了日本众议院议长清濑一郎，要求当局不要蛮干，要求停止批准“安全条约”。
    由日本大本教（日本神道教的一派）的信徒组成的人类爱善会今天在东京举行全国大会时，参加大会的来自日本全国各地的八十名代表，也到国会去递交了在上星期收集的十万份请愿书。
    今天晚间，日本属于佛教徒和平协议会的佛教徒五十位积极分子，在东京举行集会反对国会通过新日美“安全条约”。他们决定加紧活动，以使尽可能多的佛教徒参加反对这个条约的运动。
    在今天的会上通过的决议强调指出：当双手沾满对中国发动的侵略战争的血迹的人们强行修改“安全条约”的时候，佛教徒不能保持缄默。六百名青年妇女和老年妇女5月14日在香川县的高松市集会，反对国会批准“安全条约”。完全由妇女参加的反对“安全条约”的群众集会在这个县举行还是第一次。
