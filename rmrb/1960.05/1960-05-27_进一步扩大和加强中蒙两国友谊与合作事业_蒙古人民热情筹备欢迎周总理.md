Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, May 26th: The Mongolian people are preparing a warm welcome for Premier Zhou Enlai's friendly visit to Mongolia. The Mongolian newspapers "Unen" and "Medee" have published articles and special editions to welcome the Chinese guests' visit.

Today, Chinese and Mongolian national flags are flying on several main streets in Ulaanbaatar, and huge red welcome slogans are hanging, reading "Long Live the Fraternal, Unbreakable, and Eternal Friendship Between the Mongolian and Chinese People" and "A Heartfelt Salute to the Great and Heroic Chinese People Building Socialism at Great Leap Forward Speed."

In recent days, the people of the Mongolian capital have been cleaning streets and courtyards, planting trees and flowers, and beautifying Ulaanbaatar. They want to decorate their capital more beautifully to welcome the distinguished Chinese guests.

Many factory and enterprise workers have launched production campaigns to complete their May production plans ahead of schedule to welcome Premier Zhou Enlai's visit. In mid-May, the Mongolian Wool Textile Factory proposed completing its May production plan five days ahead of schedule and launched a vigorous production campaign throughout the factory. By the 23rd of this month, the factory had completed 103.6% of its May production plan, and the workers had also produced several new products. Workers at the Ulaanbaatar Flour Mill are working with great enthusiasm to welcome Premier Zhou. They are completing their May production tasks better than in any previous month. The Khara-Khorin Livestock Farm completed its spring plowing and sowing tasks ahead of schedule this year. Farm Director Purbu told reporters that all employees of the farm expressed their desire to welcome the distinguished Chinese guests with even better production achievements.

Miner Chagki of the Nalaikh Coal Mine said, "Every month I complete 110% to 113% of my production target. To welcome Comrade Zhou Enlai's visit, I guarantee to complete more than 150% of each shift's production task. I am very happy to look forward to Comrade Zhou Enlai's arrival because this is a visit from the envoy of the fraternal Chinese people. There is no doubt that this visit will make a great contribution to further expanding and strengthening the cause of friendship and cooperation between our two countries."

Today, the Mongolian newspaper "Unen" reported on China's socialist construction achievements. The newspaper published a special article titled "The Benefits Brought by the Three Magic Weapons" in the "People's Republic of China in the Great Leap Forward" section, praising the great achievements of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes in China's socialist construction. The article stated that as a result of China's implementation of the Communist Party of China's general line for socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, it completed the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy three years ahead of schedule, achieved good results, and on this basis, made 1960 the beginning of a leap forward development for the entire 1960s.

The article pointed out that another important force promoting China's leap forward development is that the people's communes established in the vast rural areas have been generally consolidated and have begun to be established on a large scale in cities.

The article said that the amazing achievements of the Chinese people in building socialism make his friends happy and arouse the hatred of hostile elements at the same time. However, in the face of the vivid facts of China's socialist construction achievements, the slanders of the enemies of socialism have failed.

"Medee" published a special edition to welcome Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Mongolia. The newspaper published a photo and resume of Premier Zhou on the first page. The second and third pages of the newspaper, under the banner headline "Fraternal Assistance of the Great Chinese People," reported in detail on China's assistance in the construction of industrial enterprises in Mongolia.

    进一步扩大和加强中蒙两国友谊与合作事业
    蒙古人民热情筹备欢迎周总理
    新华社乌兰巴托26日电　蒙古人民准备热烈欢迎周恩来总理到蒙古进行友好访问。蒙古“真理报”和“消息报”发表文章和出专刊，欢迎中国客人的访问。
    今天，乌兰巴托市的几条大街上，飘扬着中蒙两国国旗，悬挂着写有“蒙中人民兄弟般的牢不可破的永恒友谊万岁”、“向以大跃进速度建设社会主义的伟大的英雄中国人民致以衷心的敬礼”的红色巨幅欢迎标语。
    蒙古首都人民近日来把街道庭院打扫得干干净净，栽树种花，美化乌兰巴托。他们要把自己的首都装饰得更加漂亮，来迎接中国贵宾。
    许多工厂企业的职工开展生产竞赛争取提前完成5月份的生产计划来迎接周恩来总理访问。蒙古毛纺织厂在5月中旬提出提前五天完成5月份生产计划，并在全厂开展了轰轰烈烈的生产竞赛。到本月23日，这个工厂就完成5月份生产计划的103.6％，工人们还生产了几种新产品。乌兰巴托面粉厂职工为欢迎周总理而热情高涨地劳动着。他们在5月份的生产任务比以往任何一个月都完成得好。哈拉和林农牧场今年提前完成了春耕播种任务。场长普尔布向记者说，全场职工都表示要以更好的生产成绩来迎接中国贵宾。
    那来河煤矿矿工恰基说：“每月我完成生产指标110％—113％，为了欢迎周恩来同志的访问，我保证完成每班生产任务的150％以上。我十分高兴地期待周恩来同志的到来，因为这是兄弟的中国人民的使者的访问。毫无疑问，这次访问将对进一步扩大和加强我们两国的友谊与合作的事业作出极大的贡献”。
    今天，蒙古“真理报”报道了中国的社会主义建设成就。报纸在“跃进中的中华人民共和国”的专栏里刊登了题为“三件法宝所带来的好处”的专文，赞扬中国建设社会主义的总路线、大跃进和人民公社三个法宝取得巨大成就。文章说，由于中国实现了中国共产党的社会主义建设的总路线、大跃进和人民公社的结果，提前三年完成了发展国民经济第二个五年计划的主要指标，取得了良好成就，并在此基础上使1960年成为整个六十年代跃进发展的开端。
    文章指出，促进中国跃进发展的另外一个重要力量是广大农村建立的人民公社普遍得到巩固，并开始在城市大规模的建立人民公社。
    文章说，中国人民建设社会主义取得的惊人成就使他的朋友感到高兴，同时引起敌对分子的憎恨。但是，在中国社会主义建设成就的生动事实面前，社会主义敌人的诽谤遭到了失败。
    “消息报”出专刊欢迎周恩来总理访问蒙古。这家报纸在第一版上刊登了周总理的相片和简历。报纸的第二、三版，在“伟大的中国人民兄弟的援助”的通栏标题下面，详细报道了中国帮助蒙古建设工业企业的情况。
