Xinhua News Agency, May 24th – Tidiane Baidy Ly, Secretary-General of the West African-Asian Solidarity Committee and Central Committee Member of the African Independence Party, who is currently visiting China, told our reporter in Beijing on the 22nd that he strongly condemned U.S. imperialism for sabotaging the Four-Power Summit. He said: "This fact has once again exposed to the people of the world that U.S. imperialism does not want peace. It turns out that they had no desire to conduct peaceful negotiations at all!"

This person from the Republic of Senegal in the Mali Federation of West Africa pointed out: "The head of imperialism, U.S. imperialism, is the source of all disasters and bad things." He pointed out that the great struggles of the Japanese people, the South Korean people, and the Turkish people against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs "clearly illustrate how irreconcilable the contradictions between U.S. imperialism and the people of all countries are."

Tidiane said that he saw the Chinese workers, peasants, and people from all walks of life, regardless of gender or age, at the huge mass rallies in various parts of China supporting the just struggles of the Japanese, South Korean, and Turkish people, were so enthusiastic and angry. "This shows that the united Chinese people love world peace, and they unconditionally support the people of all countries striving for national independence. The Chinese people are making great contributions to the establishment of genuine world peace. Such rallies are a great encouragement to us, the people of all countries who are fighting for national independence, and further strengthen our belief in struggle, because we see that we are not isolated."

He angrily condemned U.S. imperialism for supporting French colonialists in their bloody suppression of African people demanding independence, as well as the neo-colonialism that French imperialism is pursuing in Africa under the strong pressure of the African people's struggle. He pointed out that this kind of attempt to deceive the people with fake independence will not last long.

Tidiane talked about the agreement between France and the authorities of the Mali Federation, under which the Mali Federation will declare its independence in June this year, but will remain within the "French Community." He said: "According to the agreement, French colonialists will still retain military bases in the Mali Federation. This means that they will continue to use these bases to wage colonial wars against Algeria and threaten the independence of Guinea. Foreign policy will still be based on French policy, and currency, important resources, higher education, foreign trade, and telecommunications will all be controlled by France."

He said: "Can this be true independence? We must continue to struggle in every way until we achieve complete independence, that is, true independence in politics and economy."

Talking about his visit to China, Tidiane said: "The situation in China shows what miracles a truly independent country and a truly liberated people can create." He said that after returning, he must tell the people of Africa everything he personally saw in China, and tell them how shameful it is for imperialist and reactionary newspapers to spread rumors and distort the situation in New China.

    西非亚非团结委员会秘书长指出
    美帝国主义是万恶之源
    美国破坏四国首脑会议再次暴露它不要和平
    中国人民的集会鼓舞各国人民争取独立斗争
    新华社24日讯　正在我国访问的西非亚非团结委员会秘书长、非洲独立党中央委员提迪安·巴依迪·黎22日在北京接见本社记者时，严厉谴责美帝国主义破坏四国首脑会议。他说：“这一事实在全世界人民面前再一次揭露了美帝国主义是不要和平的。原来他们根本就没有进行和平谈判的愿望！”
    这位来自西非马里联邦塞内加尔共和国的人士指出：“帝国主义的头子美帝国主义是一切灾祸和坏事的渊源。”他指出，日本人民、南朝鲜人民、土耳其人民风起云涌的反对美帝国主义及其走狗的伟大斗争，“清晰地说明了美帝国主义同各国人民的矛盾是多么不可调和。”
    提迪安说，他在我国各地支持日本人民、南朝鲜人民和土耳其人民正义斗争的巨大群众集会上，看到中国的工人、农民、各行各业的人民，不分男女老少，都是那样热情和愤怒。“这说明团结一致的中国人民热爱世界和平，他们无条件地支持一切争取民族独立的国家的人民。中国人民在为建立真正的世界和平作出巨大的贡献。这样的集会，对我们这些正在进行争取民族独立斗争的各国人民是莫大的鼓舞，进一步加强了我们的斗争信念，因为我们看到了我们不是孤立的。”
    他愤怒地谴责美帝国主义支持法国殖民主义者对要求独立的非洲人民进行血腥镇压，以及法帝国主义在非洲人民斗争的强大压力下正在非洲推行的新殖民主义。他指出，这种用假独立企图欺骗人民，是长久不了的。
    提迪安谈到根据法国与马里联邦当局的协议，马里联邦将在今年6月宣布独立，仍留在“法兰西共同体”内。他说：“根据协议，法国殖民主义者仍将在马里联邦保有军事基地。这意味着，他们将继续利用这些基地向阿尔及利亚进行殖民战争，并威胁几内亚的独立。外交政策仍以法国的政策为转移，货币、重要资源、高等教育、对外贸易、电讯交通等都将由法国控制。”
    他说：“这能是真正的独立吗？我们要用一切方式继续进行斗争，直到获得完全的独立，即在政治上、经济上的真正独立。”
    谈到在中国的参观访问时，提迪安说：“中国的情况说明，一个真正独立了的国家和真正解放了的人民是能够创造怎样的奇迹。”他表示回去后一定要把亲身看到的中国的一切真实情况告诉非洲的人民，并且告诉他们，帝国主义和反动报刊造谣歪曲新中国的情况是何等的可耻。
