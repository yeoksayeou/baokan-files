Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, May 30th: Tibetan children in Lhasa are carrying out various activities to welcome the "June 1st" International Children's Day.

    Middle school, primary school, and dozens of private primary school students in Lhasa have actively responded to the call of the Communist Youth League Lhasa Municipal Committee to "do a good deed for everyone" before the "June 1st" festival. Children have formed hairdressing groups, papermaking groups, glue-making groups, and planting experimental garden teams, and have universally carried out production increase and economy and patriotic health movements. To date, students have collected more than 29,000 jin of scrap iron and copper and more than 10,000 jin of firewood. They have also eliminated many mosquitoes and flies and cleared a large amount of garbage. Students are also planting flowers and trees on campus, repairing lawns, and beautifying the campus.

    A dance team composed of hundreds of children is currently rehearsing rich and varied song and dance programs such as "Striving for a Great Agricultural Harvest," "Working Hard to Learn Culture," and "Down with U.S. Imperialism" in connection with local people's production, study, and support for the just struggle of the Japanese people. They are preparing to perform for workers, peasants, and People's Liberation Army uncles during the festival. At the Lhasa People's Stadium, nearly a thousand young athletes are holding the first Tibet Youth Games to welcome their festival.

    Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, May 30th: More than 30,000 children in Yinchuan City, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, have recently launched a "Ten Thousand Good Deeds" campaign throughout the city centered on supporting agriculture and vigorously promoting the patriotic health movement to welcome "June 1st". At present, young children have done more than 12,000 good deeds in this activity.

    The vast number of young children in Yinchuan City actively participated in activities to support urban and rural people's communes. The Young Pioneers of the fifth grade of Experimental Primary School organized a service team to help the urban people's commune service station deliver letters, draw water, buy coal, and transport grain for the masses in their spare time. The children of the Third Primary School linked up with five public canteens and kindergartens and nurseries, cleaning the canteens, teaching the children of kindergartens and nurseries to dance, sing, and tell stories, and also helping the Honghua Commune production team weed and deliver fertilizer. The teachers and students of Fengdeng Primary School of Xincheng Commune reclaimed more than ten mu of wasteland, established a small farm, and formulated production targets of 1,000 jin of oil and 10,000 jin of vegetables, and proposed to the city's young children to plant sunflowers and castor beans on a large scale, increase oil production, and send a "Red Scarf" brand tractor to the commune. This proposal was immediately warmly responded to by the children of the city.

    In order to welcome their festival cleanly, the city's young children have once again set off a climax of the patriotic health movement. The Fourth Primary School established a health supervision post and a health inspection team, which regularly go out to check hygiene and publicize patriotic health knowledge to the masses.

    Technical innovation and technical revolution activities have greatly inspired young children's interest in scientific research. The Young Pioneers of Yinchuan No. 2 Middle School established a Red Scarf weather station, rain or shine, and report the weather to the whole school on time; the Young Pioneers of the pig farm overcame various difficulties, increasing the number of piglets from more than a dozen to more than fifty in three months, and also learned the technology of treating pigs.

    In recent days, while studying hard and striving for excellent academic results, the city's young children have also actively carried out cultural and sports activities, preparing to participate in the citywide "June 1st" Children's Art Performance and Children's Athletics Games.

    银川市广大少年儿童积极参加了支援城乡人民公社的活动。实验小学五年级的少先队员们组织了服务小组，在业余时间帮助城市人民公社服务站为群众送信、拉水、买炭和运粮。第三小学的孩子们与五个公共食堂及幼儿园、托儿所挂了勾，为食堂搞卫生，教幼儿园、托儿所的孩子们跳舞、唱歌、讲故事，还帮助红花公社生产队锄草、送肥。新城公社丰登小学师生开荒十多亩，建立了小农场，制订千斤油料和万斤蔬菜的生产指标，并向全市少年儿童提出大种向日葵、蓖麻，增产油料，为公社送一台“红领巾”牌拖拉机的倡议。这个倡议立刻得到全市小朋友们的热烈响应。
