    Who is it...
    Fang Zihang, worker at Beijing Golden Star Pen Factory

    Who is it that builds spiderweb-like military bases on foreign soil?
    Who is it that uses countless missiles to suffocate hundreds of millions of people?
    Who is it that points black gun barrels at the ridges of China and the Soviet Union?
    Who is it that sends piratical airplanes into Soviet airspace?
    Who is it that painstakingly sabotages the Four-Power Summit Conference?
    Who is it that makes the people of the world face a new war crisis…
    It is the honey-mouthed, dagger-hearted Eisenhower!
    It is the inherently aggressive American imperialism!
    The devil's hands are stained with blood,
    The butcher's body is filled with stench!
    Peace depends on the people of all countries strengthening their struggle,
    Not on kowtowing and begging the aggressors.
    As long as imperialism still exists,
    Not a minute of vigilance can be relaxed!

    是谁……
    北京金星笔厂工人　方孜行是谁在别国领土上，建起蛛网般的军事基地？是谁用无数枚导弹，压得亿万人民喘不过气？是谁把黑色炮口，指着中苏两国的屋脊？是谁向苏联领空，开进了海盗式的飞机？是谁煞费苦心地，破坏了四国首脑会议？是谁使世界人民，面临着新战争的危机……是口蜜腹剑的艾森豪威尔！是侵略成性的美帝国主义！魔鬼的两手血迹斑斑，屠夫的身上充满腥气！和平靠各国人民加强斗争，不能向侵略者们磕头求乞。只要是帝国主义仍然存在，一分钟也不允许放松警惕！
