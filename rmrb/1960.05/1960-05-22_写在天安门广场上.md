    Written on Tiananmen Square
    Zou Difan
    On Tiananmen Square, three million people sing for the Soviet Union. Sing of your just stance, sing of your fight against the wild jackals. The east wind is strong, the red flag shines bright, the crowds surge like waves, the demonstration队伍人人strong, we are the iron wall and copper wall defending peace. Moscow, the Seven-Year Plan is busy at work, Ukraine, building the granary of communism, Stalingrad, machines bloom and emit fragrance... Suddenly, the sound of invading enemy planes fills the sky, you come out of factories, farms, and classrooms: Oppose war provocations! Let the invaders perish! You come out, we come out, singing here, applauding there, shouting here, singing in chorus there, from Tiananmen Square, we seem to be holding your arms. Let us march to the streets together, let us sing resistance together, let us grab the American imperialists by the ears and speak to them, let us slap the invaders in the face together. Provoking the Soviet Union is provoking us. The Soviet Union is our elder brother, how can we forget our flesh and blood ties! The October Revolution's cannon fire gave us revolutionary thought to arm ourselves, ten years of construction have brought help, the friendship and kindness are as long as the Yangtze River... Riding together on the socialist ironclad train, who dares to block the road? The whistle blows, the red flag waves, the paper tiger blocking the road is doomed to destruction. The Chinese and Soviet people raise the flag of justice, the flag waves and illuminates the sun and moon, the people of the world unite, the whole world becomes a great meeting place, the people decide the affairs of the world, the people are the masters of their own house.

    写在天安门广场上
    邹荻帆在天安门广场上，三百万人为苏联歌唱。歌唱你们正义的立场，歌唱你们打击野豺狼。东风浩荡红旗亮，人群滚滚卷波浪，示威的队伍人人壮，我们就是保卫和平的铁壁和铜墙。莫斯科啊，七年计划工作忙，乌克兰啊，建设共产主义的米粮仓，斯大林格勒啊，机器开花吐芳香……猛听得侵略敌机天空响，你们走出工厂田庄和课堂：反对战争挑衅！要侵略者灭亡！你们走出来，我们走出来，这边唱歌，那边鼓掌，这边呼喊，那边合唱，从天安门的广场上，我们仿佛挽着你们的臂膀。一齐来走上大街，一齐来高唱反抗，一齐抓着美帝的耳朵把话讲，一齐给侵略者一耳光。向苏联挑衅，就是向我们挑衅。苏联是我们老大哥，骨肉之亲怎能忘！十月革命炮声响，给我们革命思想以武装，十年建设得帮助，友谊恩情江水长……共乘社会主义铁甲车，谁敢扑面把路挡？汽笛鸣叫红旗动，拦路纸老虎自取灭亡。中苏人民打起正义的旗，旗帜卷动日月光，全世界人民大团结，全世界变成大会场，人民决定天下事，人民作主把家当。
