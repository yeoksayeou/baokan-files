    Acoustics on Wood
    He Zi
    From the oracle bone inscriptions unearthed in Yin Ruins, it can be seen that the character "乐" (music) is composed of silk strings added to wood, indicating that our ancestors knew and utilized acoustics on wood a long time ago.
    Which musical instrument can do without wood? The wooden fish, wooden clapper, and xylophone are purely wooden solo performances.
    In ancient times, Boya's flowing water and knowing sound were plucked from the guqin; without wood, how could a qin be made?
    Speaking of the guqin, one cannot help but think of the anecdote of the famous guqin of the Han Dynasty - the Jiao Wei Qin (Burnt Tail Qin).
    One day, Cai Yong accidentally heard the cracking sound of burning parasol wood, and "heard the sound as if seeing the person". He knew that this was a good material for musical instruments, so he asked someone to cut it into a qin, and the sound was indeed very beautiful. Because the tail of the wood was burnt, it was named Jiao Wei Qin.
    Pianos and violins cannot be made without wood. Which tree's wood sings the best? Is it the oak, the king of the forest, or the gentle birch and poplar, or the beautiful maple, or the majestic cedar? None of them, only spruce is the best resonance material for pianos; violins, on the other hand, favor the wood of maple trees.
    Musical instrument factories often store such round logs. Like fine wine, they must be preserved for several years before they become the soul of musical instruments.
    Why must wood be used to make musical instruments?
    We know that wood is composed of tubular fibers and has the characteristics of sound amplification and resonance.
    Spruce, maple, and other woods have dense and uniform annual rings, which can well transmit high-frequency sounds without changing the tone; the structure of the surrounding wood and the wood near the heart of the tree is not different, and the sound resonance intensity is also uniform. This guarantees that pianists and violinists can create a wonderful sound atmosphere.
    Generally speaking, wood is a very good sound runway. Research has confirmed that sound runs only 330.7 meters per second on the air runway, 3,900 meters on copper, 5,000 meters on straight-grained pine, 5,000 meters on iron, and 5,100 to 6,000 meters on glass.
    Oh! No wonder mechanics in machinery factories use one end of a wooden stick tightly against the engine and the other end against their ears, like doctors using a stethoscope, to check the secrets of the engine's heart.
    After the 18th-century German music master Beethoven became deaf, he relied on wooden sticks to listen to piano performances. One end of the stick touched the piano, and the other end was bitten by his teeth. The vibrations of the steel strings were transmitted to the stick, and then from the teeth bones to the inner ear.
    Many people whose eardrums are damaged but whose internal auditory organs are still intact are able to dance the waltz gracefully to the melody of the music because the sound is transmitted to the auditory organs through the floor and their own bones.
    The sound transmission of wood is a headache for architects.
    In the seventeenth century, the German scientist Guericke conducted an interesting experiment. He placed a clock in a glass cover connected to a vacuum pump, and then gradually extracted the air from the cover. The ticking sound of the pendulum gradually weakened and eventually became almost inaudible. If air is returned at this time, the ticking sound will be strengthened again.
    The experiment tells us that air can transmit sound.
    80% of the pores in wood become hotels for air; the air living in thousands of hotels constantly probes for sound information, and once discovered, quickly transmits it from the east room to the west room. Architects have calculated that if the air sound transmission coefficient is one, then the sound transmission coefficient of a 2.4 cm thick wooden wall is 0.63, while the sound transmission coefficient of a 2.5 cm thick concrete wall is only 0.11.
    Therefore, when building houses with wood, especially telephone rooms, telegraph rooms, and theaters, it is necessary to solve the problem of sound insulation.

### 木材上的声学

    木材上的声学
    禾子
    从殷墟所发掘出来的甲骨文中看到，乐字是由丝弦加在木头上组成的（?），可见我国祖先早就知道并利用木材上的声学。
    哪一样乐器能少得了木材。木鱼、木梆、木琴，纯粹是木材唱的独角戏。
    古代的伯牙的流水知音，是在古琴上拨弄出来的；没有木头，何以成琴？
    说到古琴，不禁使人想起汉朝有名的古琴——焦尾琴的轶事来。
    有一天，蔡邕偶而听到梧桐木材焚烧时所发出的爆裂声音，“闻声如见其人”，他知道这是很好的乐器用材，于是请人裁制成琴，果然音色很美。由于木材尾部已被烧焦，所以，取名为焦尾琴。
    钢琴，提琴，离开木材，同样无法成琴。哪种树的木材唱得最好听呢？是森林之王的橡树，或是温柔的白桦白杨，或是美丽的丹枫，还是雄强的雪松？都不是，只有枞树（云杉）是钢琴上最好的共鸣材料；提琴呢，则看中槭类树木的木材。
    乐器厂里经常贮藏着这类的圆木。它们同美酒一样，必须保存几年之后，才会成为乐器的灵魂。
    为什么必须用木材来制作乐器？
    我们知道，木材是由管状纤维组成的，具有扩音和共振的特征。
    云杉、槭类等木材，年轮致密均匀，能很好传播高频率的声音而不变调；周围部分木材和靠近树心部分木材的结构，没有差异，声音共震强度，也无强弱之分。保证了钢琴家、提琴家创造出美妙的音响气氛。
    拿所有的木材来说，它是声音很好的跑道。据研究证实，声音在空气跑道上，每秒只跑三百三十点七米，在铜上跑三千九百米，在顺纹松木上跑五千米，在铁上跑五千米，在玻璃上跑五千一百到六千米。
    哦！怪不得机械厂技工用木棍的一端紧贴发动机，另一端靠住耳朵，好像大夫用听诊器似的，来检查发动机心脏的秘密。
    十八世纪的德国音乐大师贝多芬耳聋之后，就是靠木棒来谛听钢琴演奏的。棒的一端接触钢琴，另一端用牙齿咬住，钢弦上的震动，就传到棒上，再由齿骨传到内耳。
    许多因耳朵鼓膜破坏，而内部听觉器官尚完好的人，他们之所以能够随着乐曲的旋律，翩翩地跳起华尔兹来，也正是声音经过地板和本人的骨胳传到听觉器官的关系。
    木材的透音问题，是使建筑家伤脑筋的一桩事。
    十七世纪，德国科学家葛利克做了一个有趣的实验。他把钟放在接有抽气机的玻璃罩内，然后把罩内的空气逐渐抽出，钟摆的滴搭声逐渐减弱，最后几乎听不到。这时如果又放回空气，滴搭声又会加强起来。
    实验告诉我们，空气是会传播声音的。
    木材身上有80％的孔隙，都成为空气的旅馆；住在千千万万个旅馆里的空气，时时刻刻刺探声音的情报，一旦发现，很快地从东房传到西房。建筑家计算过：假定空气透音系数是一，那么，二点四厘米厚的木墙的透音系数则是零点六三，而二点五厘米厚的混凝土墙的透音系数，只有零点一一。
    因此，用木材建造房子，尤其是电话室、电报室、影剧院，就需要解决隔音问题。
