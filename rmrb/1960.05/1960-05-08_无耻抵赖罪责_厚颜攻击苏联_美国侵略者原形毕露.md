    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 7th: Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev’s solemn condemnation of the provocative act of American military aircraft intruding into the Soviet Union has put the United States in a very awkward position. American authorities and bourgeois newspapers are doing their utmost to quibble about this act of aggression, and are using the shameful incident of the American plane being shot down to bite back and stir up calls for attacks on the Soviet Union.
    The U.S. State Department issued a statement on the 5th denying that the aircraft that intruded into Soviet airspace was an American "civilian" "U-2 weather reconnaissance plane," saying that the plane "may have lost consciousness due to the failure of the oxygen equipment, causing the pilot to continue flying for a considerable distance on autopilot, accidentally violating Soviet airspace." The U.S. government also sent a note to the Soviet government on the 6th, demanding that the Soviet Union provide all the facts about the aircraft and the whereabouts of the pilot. A spokesman for the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration also held a special press conference on the 5th, publicizing that the plane was only responsible for the "peaceful mission" of studying high-altitude weather conditions. However, the spokesman was unable to answer the question raised by reporters at the time as to why the United States was so interested in the weather conditions on the Soviet border. He was also forced to admit that the "missing" American plane strangely had no American markings and carried high-altitude photography equipment.
    U.S. congressmen took the opportunity to make "Cold War" noises. Senate Democratic Leader Johnson tried his best to promote the untenable idea that the American plane that intruded into Soviet airspace was "peaceful" and "lost its way," while biting back, attacking the Soviet Union for using the incident "as a means to achieve its goals at the upcoming summit meeting." Senator Mansfield of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee attacked the Soviet Union, turning black into white, saying, "They are the ones who provoked, and they are the ones who are undermining the prospects for peace." Senator Bridges even openly asked Eisenhower not to attend the East-West summit and not to visit the Soviet Union.
    The American bourgeois propaganda machine has also started up, trying its best to cover up the American military provocation, while viciously attacking the Soviet Union, threatening to undermine the summit meeting.
    The "New York Herald Tribune" attacked the Soviet Union's righteous act of self-defense in shooting down the American invading plane in an editorial on the 6th, and shouted, "Any prospect of improving the international situation now seems so remote that attending the summit conference seems to be nothing more than a futile trip."
    The "New York Daily News" threatened to "smash the summit conference and sink it without a trace."
    However, some American bourgeois newspaper commentators had to admit that the United States was in the wrong, and expressed uneasiness about this American military provocation. For example, Reston, a commentator for the "New York Times" in Washington, wrote, "It is not others, but the United States that has army and air force bases on the borders adjacent to the Soviet Union and China, not the Soviet Union and China that have military bases on the borders of the United States." He also said, "It is not clear why planes were sent to collect weather information in the days before the summit meeting with Khrushchev, and to study wind direction on the Soviet-Turkish border." Reston also said that what happened on the "southern border of the Soviet Union is no child's play. Many countries and individuals should ask themselves, if they were in their shoes, what would they think."

### 无耻抵赖罪责　厚颜攻击苏联  美国侵略者原形毕露

    无耻抵赖罪责　厚颜攻击苏联
    美国侵略者原形毕露
    新华社7日讯　华盛顿消息：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫对美国军用飞机侵入苏联的挑衅行动的严正谴责使美国十分狼狈。美国当局和资产阶级报刊极力为这种侵略行为进行狡辩，并且利用美国飞机被击落这一可耻事件反咬一口，掀起攻击苏联的叫嚷。
    美国国务院5日发表声明抵赖说，侵入苏联领空的是一架美国“民用”的“U—2式气象侦察飞机”，这架飞机“完全可能由于氧气设备的失灵使得这个驾驶员失去了知觉，以致这架飞机自动驾驶又继续飞行了相当长的一段距离，偶然地侵犯了苏联领空。”美国政府还在6日照会苏联政府，反而要苏联提出有关这架飞机的全部事实和飞机上飞行员的下落。美国国家航空和宇宙航行局发言人也在5日特别举行了记者招待会，宣传这架飞机只负有研究高空气象条件的“和平的使命”。但是这个发言人当时无法回答记者所提出的美国为什么对苏联边境的气象条件这样有兴趣这个问题。他还被迫承认美国这架“失踪的”飞机很奇怪地没有美国的标记，并且携有高空照相设备。
    美国国会议员乘机大发“冷战”叫嚣，参议院民主党领袖约翰逊一方面极力宣传侵入苏联领空的美国飞机是“和平的”、“迷失方向的”这种站不住脚的说法，同时反咬一口，攻击苏联利用这个事件“作为在即将举行的最高级会议上达到目的的手段”。参议院外交委员会委员曼斯菲尔德颠倒黑白地攻击苏联说，“挑衅的是他们，破坏和平前景的也是他们。”参议员布里奇斯甚至公然要艾森豪威尔不要参加东西方最高级会议和不到苏联去访问。
    美国资产阶级的宣传机器也纷纷开动起来，竭力掩饰美国的军事挑衅行动，同时恶毒地攻击苏联，以破坏最高级会议来要挟。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”6日在社论中攻击苏联击落美国入侵飞机这一正义的自卫行动，并叫喊，“任何改善国际局势的前景现在似乎是如此的遥远，以致去参加最高级会议看来只不过是徒劳往返而已。”
    “纽约每日新闻”威胁要“搞垮最高级会议，把它沉没得无影无踪”。
    但是，某些美国资产阶级报刊评论员也不得不承认美国理亏，并且对美国这种军事挑衅行动表示不安。例如“纽约时报”驻华盛顿评论员赖斯顿写道，“不是别人，正是美国在同苏联和中国接壤的边境上设有陆军和空军基地，而不是苏联和中国在美国的边境上设有军事基地”。他还说，“不明白为什么在同赫鲁晓夫举行最高级会议的前几天要派飞机去收集气象情报，和在苏联—土耳其边境上研究风向。”赖斯顿还说，发生在“苏联南部边境的事件不是任何儿戏。许多国家和个别的人应当扪心自问，如果他们设身处地，将会有何感想”。
