Xinhua News Agency, 13th Dispatch: The Japanese Diet held a public hearing today on the issue of the new "Security Treaty."  Witnesses from the Socialist Party, former Hosei University President Hyooe Ouchi and commentator Yoko Matsuoka, expressed their opposition to the newly signed U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" at the hearing today.

Hyooe Ouchi emphasized that the newly signed U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" is inconsistent with the Japanese Constitution. He said that the Japanese people feel uneasy about this treaty, and the surge in petition movements demonstrates this sentiment.  It is only natural that China and Southeast Asian countries, which were invaded by Japanese militarism in the past, say that the new treaty is aggressive.

Hyooe Ouchi expressed opposition to the Diet approving this treaty in violation of the Constitution.

When talking about Japan's past acts of aggression, Ouchi emphasized that the entire Japanese people should be ashamed of the role Japan played in World War II. He said, "Therefore, Japan should formally apologize to China and Southeast Asian countries for the damage Japan caused to these countries during the last war." Ouchi said, "In particular, Japan's recognition of the Chiang Kai-shek clique is completely unreasonable," because the Chiang Kai-shek clique "does not represent the 650 million Chinese people."

Hyooe Ouchi said: The new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" should be abolished, and diplomatic relations should be restored with China.

Yoko Matsuoka said that the Nobusuke Kishi government, on the one hand, pretends to desire Japan's independence, but on the other hand, takes actions to undermine Japan's independence.

Matsuoka further criticized the government for not protesting to the United States regarding the issue of the U-2 type jet planes using Japanese bases. Matsuoka said, "Everyone knows that a country where foreign troops are stationed should be considered not much different from a colony."

She said that those who are launching opposition to the approval of the new "Security Treaty" will never yield to the reactionaries.

She emphasized that the efforts to strive for peace will surely receive the support of the people of the world and produce positive results. She finally said, "The Japanese people know this based on their own personal experience."

In response to questions raised by Liberal Democratic Party members Ryosaku Kaji and Tokuji Tokonami, Professor Hyooe Ouchi pointed out that Japan is becoming a militaristic country, allied with the United States, the world's largest militaristic country. However, Japan should adhere to the spirit of the Constitution. Japan must not rely on armaments.

He continued, "Japan should not pursue the current policy of concluding military alliances, but should adopt a policy of peaceful neutrality and have foreign military bases withdrawn from its territory. Japan should also pay reparations to China."

Witness Yoko Matsuoka, in response to questions raised by Democratic Socialist Party members Tsuruyo Tsutsumi and Riko Tobari, said, "I have participated in many meetings and conferences against the Security Treaty held by the Security Treaty Criticism Association, the Security Treaty Research Association, the YWCA, and various local small women's groups. In all these occasions, I was very moved by the fact that all the women attending these conferences were seriously concerned about the dangers of revising the Security Treaty.

She warned: "If the government and the ruling party dare to rely on the strength of their number of members in the Diet, and forcibly pass this treaty in the Diet with the help of police violence, I am certain that the people's righteous indignation will erupt."

    日本人民决不向反动派屈服
    公众代表在国会公听会上抨击美日反动派侵略政策
    坚决主张取消日美军事同盟条约并同中国恢复邦交
    据新华社13日讯　日本国会今天就新“安全条约”问题举行公听会。社会党的作证人、前法政大学校长大内兵卫和评论家松冈洋子今天在会上表示反对新签订的日美“安全条约”。
    大内兵卫强调说，新签订的日美“安全条约”是不符合日本宪法的。他说，日本国民对这个条约感到不安，请愿运动的高涨就表现了这种情绪。过去遭到日本军国主义侵略的中国和东南亚国家说新条约是侵略性的，这是理所当然的。
    大内兵卫表示反对国会违反宪法批准这个条约。
    大内在谈到日本过去的侵略行动时强调，日本全体人民应当对日本在第二次世界大战中所扮演的角色引以为耻。他说“因此，日本应当为日本在上次战争期间对中国和东南亚国家所造成的损害，正式向这些国家道歉。”大内说，“特别是，日本承认蒋介石集团是十分不合理的”，因为蒋介石集团“并不代表六亿五千万中国人民”。
    大内兵卫说：应当取消新日美“安全条约”，同中国恢复邦交。
    松冈洋子说，岸信介政府一方面假装想望日本的独立，另一方面却采取行动破坏日本的独立。
    松冈进一步抨击政府没有就议论中的U—2型喷气式飞机使用日本基地的问题向美国提出抗议。松冈说，“大家知道，应该认为有外国军队驻扎的国家和殖民地是没有多大区别的。”
    她说，正在展开反对批准新“安全条约”的人决不会向反动派屈服。
    她强调指出，争取和平的努力必将得到世界人民的支持和产生积极的结果。她最后说，“日本人民根据自己的切身经验知道这一点。”
    在答复自由民主党议员锻冶良作和床次德二所提出的问题后，大内兵卫教授指出，日本正在变成一个军国主义国家，同美国——世界上最大的军国主义国家结成同盟。但是，日本应当坚持宪法的精神。日本必须不依靠军备。
    他继续说，“日本现在不应当奉行目前缔结军事同盟的政策，而应当采取和平中立政策，并且使外国军事基地撤出它的领土。日本还应当向中国支付赔偿。”
    作证人松冈洋子在答复民主社会党议员堤鹤与户叶里子所提出的问题时说，“我参加过安全条约批判会，安全条约问题研究会，女青年会和各地方小妇女团体所举行的许多反对安全条约的会议和大会。在所有这些场合中，出席这些大会的所有妇女都严重关心修改安全条约的危险，这使我非常感动。
    她警告说：“如果政府和执政党敢于依靠他们在国会之内的议员人数的力量、借助于警察的暴力，强行在国会中通过这个条约，我确信人民的义愤将爆发起来”。
