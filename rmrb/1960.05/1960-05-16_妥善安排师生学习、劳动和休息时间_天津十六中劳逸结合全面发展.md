This Newspaper reports Tianjin No. 16 Middle School comprehensively and appropriately arranges the learning, work, and rest time for teachers and students, enabling them to have both work and rest, further improving teaching quality, and ensuring the physical health of teachers and students.

    The school's Party branch pays close attention to the issue of combining work and rest for teachers and students. It adopts a unified management and separate arrangement method to ensure that teachers have time for lesson preparation, students have time for self-study, and both teachers and students have sufficient sleep and time for supplementary activities. School-wide teacher and student activities are uniformly arranged by the Party branch. Regular political, teaching, sports, and labor activities are scheduled on fixed dates. Temporary social activities and public service labor outside the school are arranged once a week and included in the school's weekly plan. Extracurricular activities for students in each grade and school-wide exams are uniformly arranged by the school. Under normal circumstances, students' extracurricular activity time does not exceed six to seven hours per week, ensuring that high school students have eight hours of sleep per day and junior high school students have nine hours of sleep per day. The school also vigorously streamlines meetings, improves meeting quality, and ensures that there are no meetings in the evening, guaranteeing teachers twenty-four hours per week for lesson preparation and grading homework, and seven to eight hours of sleep per day.

    The school has strengthened the leadership of students' classroom self-study, with teachers going into the classroom to provide guidance and help students solve difficult problems. For students who cannot study in school, the school conducts home visits and holds parent meetings to ask parents to help the school supervise students' review of their lessons and rest. The school also helps students summarize and promote good study methods, improve the learning environment, and adjust the height of desks and chairs and the intensity of lighting. Most of the classroom lighting in the school has been changed to sunlight lamps. The school's Party branch also attaches great importance to students' physical health, regularly conducts physical examinations for students, conducts hygiene education, and continuously improves sanitary conditions.

    Since the school has achieved comprehensive arrangements and a combination of work and rest in students' learning, life, and work, students have achieved all-round development in their thinking, learning, and health. The mathematics and physics learning achievements of students in the first and second grades of high school were not very good in the past. Recently, in the two unified examinations of all middle schools in the district, the total average score reached more than 80 points, and the learning achievement ranked first in the district. In terms of physical exercise, many female students in the past could not persist in running 400 meters. Recently, they all participated in the long-distance running competition in the school sports meeting and successfully ran 400 meters. The average time for male students in the 100-meter sprint has improved from 14.8 seconds to 13.8 seconds.

    妥善安排师生学习、劳动和休息时间 
    天津十六中劳逸结合全面发展
    本报讯　天津市十六中学全面地妥善地安排教师、学生的学习、劳动、休息时间，使师生有劳有逸，进一步提高了教学质量，保证了师生身体健康。
    这个学校党支部非常注意师生的劳逸结合问题，采取统一归口，分别安排的办法，保证了教师有备课时间、学生有自习时间、师生有充足的睡眠时间、补课活动时间。全校性的师生活动，由党支部统一安排，经常性的政治、教学、文体、劳动活动规定固定的日期，校外临时性的社会活动和公益劳动，每周进行一次安排，纳入学校的周计划，各年级学生课外活动和各班考试统一由学校安排。各班学生活动由班主任计划安排。在一般情况下，学生每周课外活动时间不超过六至七小时，保证高中学生每天有八小时睡眠时间，初中学生有九小时睡眠时间。学校还大力精简会议，提高会议质量，作到晚上不开会，保证教师每周有二十四小时进行备课和批改作业，每天有七至八小时睡眠时间。
    学校加强了对学生课堂自习的领导，由教师深入课堂辅导，帮助学生解决疑难问题；对不能在校自习的学生，学校就通过家庭访问，召开家长座谈会，请家长帮助学校督促学生复习功课和休息。学校还帮助学生总结推广好的学习方法，改善学习环境，调整了桌椅和灯光的度数，全校课室灯光大都改为太阳灯。学校党支部对学生身体健康情况也十分重视，定期为学生作体格检查，进行卫生常识的教育和不断改善卫生条件。
    这个学校学生学习、生活、劳动作到全面安排、有劳有逸以后，学生的思想、学习、健康方面都获得了全面发展。高中一年级和高中二年级学生的数、理学习成绩过去有些不大好，最近在全区中等学校两次统一考试中，总平均分数达八十分以上，学习成绩居全区第一名。在体育锻炼方面，过去很多女学生跑四百米坚持不下来，最近她们都参加了全校运动会中的长跑比赛，顺利地跑下了四百米。男学生的百米短跑平均由十四秒八提高到十三秒八。
