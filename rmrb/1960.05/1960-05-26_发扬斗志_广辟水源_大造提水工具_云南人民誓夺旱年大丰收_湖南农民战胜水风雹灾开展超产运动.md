The situation in Yunnan Province is currently hot and dry, often experiencing force three to five winds, and the river flow has significantly reduced, even the Yulong River, which has never dried up in the driest years, dried up a month ago. This drought seriously threatens this year's agricultural production. But the heroic people of Yunnan bravely confront the difficulties and are determined to win a great harvest in a drought year. Since March, the entire province, including workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and merchants, have responded to the call and united as one in the fight against drought. Under the slogan of "The Drier the Year, the Greater the Harvest Must Be," various regions have implemented rational water use and given full play to the benefits of water conservancy projects; reformed farming techniques and launched a technical innovation and revolution movement centered on drought resistance, and greatly produced water-lifting tools, doing everything possible to tap groundwater. According to recent incomplete statistics, the province has opened more than 1.3 million trenches, wells, ponds, and sealed gullies. The number of water-lifting tools mobilized has reached more than 990,000 pieces. As a result, the spring plowing and planting in the province is still progressing at a Great Leap Forward pace despite the severe drought. The province has already planted more than 5 million mu of rice through drought resistance. More than 15 million mu of corn and sweet potatoes have also been planted, exceeding the planting progress of previous years. Although the drought has brought enormous difficulties to production, the high temperatures it has caused can promote the early harvesting of minor spring crops and advance deep plowing. Experience has shown that if drought can be overcome and planting is done early in a drought year, each mu of land can yield an additional 100 to 300 jin of grain. Therefore, taking advantage of the favorable conditions of high ground temperature before the rainy season arrives, planting through drought resistance is the key to achieving high yields this year. To this end, the Provincial Party Committee has formulated three lines of defense for this year's grain production: First, expand the originally planned 10 million mu of large-area high-yield fields to 20 million mu, so that all crops that can be planted with water before the rainy season can achieve high yields. This is the decisive battle to win a bumper harvest this year, and also the central issue of drought resistance. Through this battle, two-thirds of the annual grain can be obtained in the condition of six months without rain. Second, make all preparations to seize the opportunity to replant 20 million mu of general farmland once it rains, to achieve more planting and more harvesting. Third, plant late autumn crops on a large scale. After this battle plan was implemented in the vast rural areas, it immediately became a huge force mobilizing the enthusiasm of millions of people.

In the long struggle against drought, the people of Yunnan not only have great enthusiasm and high confidence in drought resistance, but also have many special methods and measures that are grasped skillfully and firmly. In terms of rational water management and water conservation, thanks to the application of ten years of rich experience and the wisdom of the masses, miracles have appeared in various special districts throughout the province where one reservoir is used as two or three, and the water used to irrigate one mu of land is used to irrigate two or three mu of land, giving full play to the benefits of water conservancy projects in a manner that is fast, efficient, good, and economical. In order to support water use in neighboring communes, the Maohe Village, Chengguan, and Songcun communes of the Baicang system in Shiping County implemented unified management, tried their best to tap water storage potential, and jointly saved 1.8 million cubic meters of water to support the Baoxiu and Taocun communes. In the fight against drought, there are examples everywhere of providing convenience to others and leaving difficulties to oneself.

In terms of doing everything possible to tap water sources and expand irrigation areas, cadres and the masses in various regions have also displayed a high degree of creativity, and many clever methods with less labor and greater benefits have emerged. The province has dug more than 400,000 wells, built more than 860,000 ditches, dams, ponds, and sealed gullies, and obtained a large amount of water sources.

The vigorous technical innovation and technical revolution movement has also pushed the drought resistance movement forward. The industrial departments in various regions actively rushed to manufacture and create various types of water-lifting tools for drought resistance. The drainage and irrigation capacity of water pumps and internal combustion water pumps manufactured in the province exceeds the total increase in the past ten years. Shi Qingyun, the party branch secretary of the Dawaguan Tile Management District in Tianxing Commune, Daguan County, and other comrades created a water-powered automatic hoist, which can lift water 35 meters using the river's force, and its work efficiency is more than 80 times higher than that of manual water lifting.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, May 25th. Hunan farmers are fighting with a great fearless spirit against the natural disasters such as water, wind and hail that have recently occurred.

In early May, some communes and brigades in fourteen counties including Linxiang, Nanxian, Yueyang, and Guzhang in Hunan suffered relatively serious disasters such as wind and hail. Thanks to the kind care of the Party and the government, the cooperative support of the people in non-disaster areas, especially the people in the disaster areas who stood up bravely and struggled valiantly, they finally overcame various difficulties and reduced the destructive power of natural disasters to a minimum.

When natural disasters came, leaders at all levels always stood at the forefront of the battle. After mountain floods occurred in the Hengyang Special District, more than 98,000 cadres and more than 800,000 people, under the strong leadership of party organizations at all levels, actively carried out prevention and control. They seized the opportunity to reinforce and protect water conservancy projects on the one hand, and seized the opportunity to drain ditches on the other. This allowed one hundred and seventy-two large and small reservoirs, more than one thousand two hundred mountain ponds, and one hundred and ninety-four river dams with problems to avoid the threat of mountain floods, and also allowed more than 600,000 mu of rice fields affected by floods to drain stagnant water in a timely manner, ensuring the normal growth of seedlings.

On the evening of May 17, strong winds of level eight to nine, and gusts even reaching level eleven, occurred in some parts of the province. Party committees at all levels took emergency measures before and after the wind disaster to carry out defense and rescue. After receiving the disaster report, the Linxiang County Party Committee immediately convened a telephone meeting of commune party secretaries and brigade general branch secretaries, organizing 100,000 cadres and the masses, divided into four groups, one group to inspect, reinforce, or relocate housing and livestock pens to ensure the safety of people and livestock; the second group to protect water conservancy projects; the third group to harvest ripened rapeseed wheat, and protect spring harvest and spring planting crops; the fourth group to prevent floods and protect seedlings. When the strong winds struck, leaders at all levels courageously rescued people. When Tang Jigui, secretary of the Linxiang County Party Committee, was directing operations at the Jiangnan Brigade in the Jiangnan Commune, the roof of the brigade headquarters was blown off by the wind, and he stood in the raging wind and rain to direct the masses to prop up the houses and rescue grain in the national warehouse. The roof pillar of a kindergarten in Zhongtong Brigade, Changhou Commune, Nanxian County, was blown at an angle by the wind and was about to collapse. Hu Changgeng, deputy secretary of the commune party committee, led three cadres and used their bodies to prop up the roof beam, so that more than 70 children who did not have time to evacuate were quickly transferred to a safe area.

The Party and the government expressed boundless concern for the people in the disaster areas. The Hunan Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee promptly sent letters of condolence to the people in the disaster areas, instructed the provincial civil affairs department to issue relief funds, and dispatched a large number of capable cadres to the disaster areas to lead the restoration of production and handle post-disaster relief work. The Caowei Commune in Yuanjiang County replanted the more than 30,000 mu of seedlings that were flooded, and more than 20,000 mu of seedlings were topdressed with an average of 30 dan of fire soil ash and straw ash per mu. Other flooded economic crops and summer harvest crops were also treated. Now, all crops are thriving, a number of houses have been repaired in a timely manner, and many melons, vegetables and other crops have been replanted. The traces brought by the storm quickly disappeared.

Currently, a vigorous agricultural super-production movement is being carried out throughout the province. (Attached photo)
Yunnan Province has not had a thorough rain for more than six consecutive months, and the drought situation is severe. Under the leadership of the Party, the people of the province are working together to devote themselves to the drought-resistant planting campaign. As of May 14, the province had planted more than 20 million mu of various major spring crops through drought resistance. This is a scene where members of the Xicheng Commune in Tonghai County organized a drought-fighting army to draw water and irrigate fields to ensure water for rice transplanting.

    发扬斗志　广辟水源　大造提水工具
    云南人民誓夺旱年大丰收
    湖南农民战胜水风雹灾开展超产运动
    本报讯　目前，云南高原气候炎热，时常有三至五级大风，江河流量显著减少，甚至最干旱的年份都未断流的玉龙河水，在一个月前已经干涸。这样的干旱，严重威胁着今年的农业生产。但是英雄的云南人民，迎头战胜困难，坚决旱年夺取大丰收。从3月份起，全省工农兵学商在抗旱中一呼百应、众志成城，在“越旱越要大丰收”的口号下，各地都实行合理用水，充分地发挥了水利工程的效益；改革耕作技术，展开以抗旱为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，大造提水工具，千方百计挖掘地下水。据最近不完全统计，全省已经开沟、打井、挖塘和封沟断流一百三十多万处。出动的各种提水工具达九十九万多件。使全省春耕栽种在大旱中仍然以大跃进的步伐前进。全省已经抗旱适时栽插稻谷五百多万亩。包谷和红薯也已种下一千五百多万亩，超过了历年的栽种进度。干旱虽然给生产带来了巨大的困难，但由于干旱带来的高气温，可以促进小春作物提早收割，提前深翻。历年经验证明，如果旱年能够战胜干旱提早栽种下去，每亩田就能多收一百斤至三百斤粮食。所以，在雨季到来以前，利用天旱地温高的有利时机，抗旱栽种下去，是今年夺取高产的关键。为此，省委制定了今年粮食生产的三道防线：一、把原来计划的一千万亩大面积高产田改为两千万亩，使所有能在雨季之前有水栽种的作物都能达到高产，这是今年夺取丰收的决定性战役，也是抗旱的中心问题，通过这一战役，就能在半年无雨的条件下夺取全年粮食的三分之二。二、做好一切准备，一旦下了雨，再抢栽二千万亩一般农田，实现多种多收；三、大种晚秋作物。这个战斗部署贯彻到广大农村后，立即成为调动千百万群众积极性的巨大力量。
    在长期的抗旱斗争中，云南人民不仅在抗旱中劲头大，信心高，而且办法也特别多，措施也抓得巧，抓得硬。在合理管水和节约用水方面，由于运用了十年来的丰富经验，发挥了群众的智慧，全省各专区都出现了一个水库顶两个、三个水库用，灌一亩田的水灌两亩、三亩田的奇迹，多快好省地发挥了水利工程的效益。石屏县白仓系的帽合村、城关和松村三个公社为了支援邻社用水，实行了统一管理，尽量挖掘蓄水潜力，共同节约出一百八十万立方米水来支援宝秀、陶村两个公社。在抗旱中，这种把方便让给别人，把困难留给自己的事例到处都有。
    在千方百计挖掘水源扩大灌溉面积方面，各地干部群众也发挥了高度的创造性，出现了许多费工少、效益大的巧办法。全省已打井四十多万眼，修筑沟渠、坝塘和封沟断流八十六万多处，获得了大量水源。
    轰轰烈烈的技术革新和技术革命运动，也把抗旱运动向前推进了一步。各地工业部门积极为抗旱赶制和创造了各式各样的提水工具。全省制造的抽水机和内燃水泵等，排灌能力超过了十年来增加的总和。大关县天星公社打瓦管理区党支部书记石清云等同志，创造了水力自动天车，利用河水冲力可以提水三十五米，工效比人力车水提高八十多倍。
    本报讯　湖南农民正以大无畏的精神，与近来发生的水、风、雹等自然灾害，展开了顽强的斗争。
    5月初旬，湖南临湘、南县、岳阳、古丈等十四个县的一部分公社和大队，受了较严重的风、冰雹等灾害。由于党和政府的亲切关怀，非灾区人民的协作支援，特别是受灾地区人民挺起胸膛，奋勇斗争，终于战胜了各种困难，把自然灾害的破坏力压缩到最小程度。
    当自然灾害来到的时候，各级领导干部一直是站在战斗的最前列。衡阳专区发生山洪后，九万八千多名干部和八十多万群众，在各级党组织坚强领导下，积极进行防治。他们一面抓住加固和防护水利工程；一面抓住抽沟排水。这样就使有问题的一百七十二座大小水库、一千二百多口山塘、一百九十四座河坝避免山洪威胁，而且使六十多万亩受洪水冲击的稻田及时排干渍水，保证了禾苗正常生长。
    5月17日晚，全省部分地方发生了八到九级的大风暴，阵风还达到十一级左右。各级党委在风灾前后都采取了紧急措施，进行防御和抢救。中共临湘县委在接到灾情报告后，立即召开了公社党委书记和大队总支书记电话会议，组织十万干部群众，兵分四路，一路检查、加固或转移住房、畜栏，保证人畜安全；二路防护水利工程；三路抢收已黄熟的油菜小麦，防护春收春播作物；四路防洪保苗。大风袭来时，各级领导干部都奋不顾身，英勇抢救。中共临湘县委书记汤吉桂在江南公社江南大队指挥作战时，大队部的房顶被风吹掉了，他就站在狂风暴雨中指挥群众加撑房屋，抢救国家仓库粮食。南县长厚公社众同大队一个幼儿园的屋柱被风吹斜，马上要倒塌了，公社党委副书记胡长庚带领三个干部，用身体顶住屋梁，使七十多个来不及转移的小孩迅速转移到了安全区。
    党和政府对受灾地区的人民表示了无限的关怀。中共湖南省委和省人民委员会及时向灾区人民发出了慰问信，指示省民政部门发放救济款，同时派出大批得力干部深入灾区领导恢复生产和处理受灾善后工作。沅江县草尾公社对三万多亩被淹的禾苗进行了补蔸，其中有二万多亩禾苗平均每亩追施了火土灰和草木灰三十担。对其他被淹的经济作物和夏收作物也进行了处理。现在，各项作物欣欣向荣，还及时修好一批房屋，抢种了许多瓜菜等作物。暴风雨带来的形迹很快消失。
    目前，一个轰轰烈烈的农业超产运动正在全省各地开展。（附图片）
    云南省连续六个多月没有下过一场透雨，旱象严重。全省人民在党的领导下，同心协力投入抗旱栽种运动，到5月14日，全省已抗旱栽种了各种大春作物两千多万亩。这是通海县西城公社社员组织了抗旱大军，车水灌田，保证插秧用水
