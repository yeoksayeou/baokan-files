Heilongjiang Province's Rural Technical Revolution Enters a New Stage
Ten Types of Work Tools Form Complete Sets

(Our dispatch) In the technical innovation movement, Heilongjiang Province has initially assembled ten sets of high-efficiency tools, combining mechanization, semi-mechanization, and improved farm implements, covering ten aspects such as field operations and non-field operations. In terms of field operations, these include dryland farming, paddy field operations, and vegetable cultivation. In terms of non-field operations, these include water conservancy construction, irrigation and drainage, animal husbandry, grain and rice processing, agricultural transportation, fertilizer processing, and kitchen utensils. In each aspect, the most efficient combination of mechanized, semi-mechanized, and improved farm implements has been selected according to the type of work and production processes, creating a streamlined workflow. This ensures that each link in production is coordinated, greatly increasing efficiency. For example, in Heilongjiang Province's dryland operations, mechanized and semi-mechanized farm implements are used for sowing on half of the cultivated land, but old-fashioned hoes and sickles are still heavily used in the环节 of cultivating, weeding, and harvesting. Now, with various improved tools for the dryland operation line, the various procedures can be adapted to each other. Harvest tools have always been a weak link in the past, but now, not only has the problem of harvesting tools for general crops been solved, but even root crops and tall-stalk crops, which people consider more difficult to handle, now have harvesters. For example, a root crop harvester can complete three procedures—topping, lifting, and stacking—in one operation; one person with two horses can harvest thirty mu of land per day. A tall-stalk crop harvester can harvest corn and sorghum, harvesting about eight mu per hour. In the past, people used to pick up wheat ears by hand in the fields, but now there are also wheat-picking machines, with one person and two horses able to pick forty-five mu per day. In terms of animal husbandry, a series of processes such as feed crushing, steaming, mixing, transporting feed, feeding, watering, and removing manure have all been equipped with mechanized and semi-mechanized tools. More than eighty automated and linked production lines for pig and chicken raising have emerged, increasing the number of pigs raised by one breeder from over thirty in the past to over two thousand, and the number of chickens raised from about six hundred in the past to over five thousand.
Most of the various improved tools for the ten types of operations in rural Heilongjiang Province are relatively easy to manufacture and convenient to use, so they are being widely promoted throughout the province. This year's spring plowing in Heilongjiang Province will see most of the cultivated land sown with these high-efficiency improved tools. In Mishan County, on average, there is a set of improved sowing tools for every four hundred and fifty mu of dryland, which will greatly shorten the sowing period compared to previous years. This year, spring plowing and sowing in the four counties of the Harbin suburban area, thanks to the availability of complete sets of sowing tools, can save two million one hundred thousand man-days and thirty-six thousand horse-days.

In the agricultural technology transformation movement in Heilongjiang Province, all localities, based on the principle of focusing on field operations, simultaneously promoting the mechanization of field operations and non-field operations, and combining machines, horses, and cattle, have launched mass movements on a large scale. From the beginning of this year to early April, the province has reformed and manufactured more than 640,000 tools, accounting for 75% of last year's tool reforms. In particular, the development in the mechanization of non-field operations has been even faster. Since last winter, all localities have seized the opportunity of winter and spring plowing preparation to vigorously promote the mechanization of non-field operations. At present, the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization of non-field operations in the province is developing rapidly. Counties such as Mishan, Boli, Baiquan, Fujin, Wuchang, Yian, and Tailai have largely achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization in threshing, agricultural and sideline product processing, and feed crushing.

    黑龙江省农村技术革命运动进入新阶段
    十项作业工具配套成龙
    本报讯　黑龙江省农村在技术革新运动中，使田间作业、非田间作业等十个方面，初步配成了十套机械化、半机械化和改良农具相结合的高工效工具。在田间作业方面，包括旱田作业、水田作业、蔬菜耕作；在非田间作业方面，包括水利施工、排灌、畜牧饲养、粮米加工、农业运输、肥料加工、食堂炊具等。在每个方面都按照作业种类和生产工序，从机械化、半机械化和改良农具中，选出工效最高的配套成线。这就使生产的各个环节相适应，工效大大提高。比如黑龙江省的旱田作业，采用机械化、半机械化农具播种面积占耕地的一半，但是在中耕锄草收割等环节上，大量使用的却是旧式的锄头、镰刀。如今有了旱田作业线的各种改良工具，就可以使各项工序相互适应了。秋收工具过去一直是个薄弱环节，现在不仅解决了一般作物的收割工具问题，就连人们认为比较难解决的块根作物和高秆作物也有了收获机。比如块根收割机一次可以完成削缨、起获、集堆三个工序，一个人两匹马，一天可收获三十亩地；高秆作物收割机能收割玉米、高粱，每小时可收割八亩左右；过去一直用手拾地里的小麦穗，现在也有了拣麦机，一个人两匹马，一天可拣四十五亩。在畜牧饲养方面，如饲料粉碎、蒸煮、搅拌、运食、给食到饮水、清除粪便等一系列过程，也都配上了机械化、半机械化的工具，并且出现了八十多条养猪、养鸡生产自动线和联动线，使一个饲养员养猪由过去的三十几头提高到二千多头，养鸡由过去的六百来只提高到五千多只。
    黑龙江省农村十项作业的各种改良工具，大部分制造比较容易，使用方便，因此全省各地正在普遍推广。今年春耕，黑龙江省的大部分耕地将由这些工效高的改良工具进行播种。密山县平均每四百五十亩旱田，就有一套改良播种工具，播种期将比往年大大缩短。哈尔滨市郊区四个县今年春耕播种，由于有了整套的播种工具，可以节省二百一十万个人工，三万六千个马工。
    黑龙江省在农业技术改造运动中，各地都根据以田间作业为主，田间作业机械化和非田间作业机械化同时并举，机、马、牛结合的方针，大搞群众运动。从今年年初到4月上旬，全省就改革、制造了六十四万多件工具，占去年工具改革的75％。特别是在非田间作业机械化方面发展的更快，去冬以来，各地抓紧了冬春备耕的时机，大搞非田间作业机械化，现在全省非田间作业机械化、半机械化程度发展很快。密山、勃利、拜泉、富锦、五常、依安、泰来等县，已在脱谷、农副产品加工、饲料粉碎等方面，大部实现了机械化、半机械化。
