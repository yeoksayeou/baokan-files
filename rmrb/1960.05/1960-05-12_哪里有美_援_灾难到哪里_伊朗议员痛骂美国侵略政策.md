Wherever There is US "Aid," There is Disaster
Iranian Parliamentarian Vigorously Condemns US Aggression Policy

Xinhua News Agency, Karachi Dispatch: "Dawn" newspaper published a dispatch from Tehran saying that an Iranian parliamentarian recently sharply criticized the US imperialists for exploiting Iran and interfering in its internal affairs. The newspaper believes that such a public condemnation of the United States in Iran, which is under strict US control, is an "unexpected development."

According to "Dawn," Iranian parliamentarian Khalatbari, in a recent speech, fiercely criticized the US policy in Iran and the Middle East, and demanded that the Iranian government "reconsider its foreign policy." Khalatbari questioned the US imperialists, saying, "What kind of aid have you given us? Which of your aid programs has helped our agriculture and industry?"

Khalatbari said, "They (referring to the United States) give us loans, but every loan is attached to hundreds of conditions."

Khalatbari exposed the so-called US "aid" to Iran, saying, "Half of our income goes back into the pockets of the United States." He pointed out that Iran gives 40% of its oil revenue to the United States. When Iran had oil disputes with Britain, the United States sided with Britain.

"Dawn" said that Khalatbari's speech "aroused great interest and comments in Tehran's diplomatic and press circles" and "aroused" "great attention" among Tehran's "parliamentary figures."

The newspaper also reported that in parliament, only Sarumi, a parliamentarian from Prime Minister Eghbal's National Party, gave a dry and short speech, feebly defending US policy.

    哪里有美“援”  灾难到哪里
    伊朗议员痛骂美国侵略政策
    据新华社讯　卡拉奇电“黎明报”刊载的德黑兰消息说，伊朗议会一位议员最近尖锐地抨击美帝国主义者剥削伊朗和干涉伊朗内政。这家报纸认为，在美国严格控制下的伊朗，发生这样对美国的公开抨击，是“意想不到的发展”。
    据“黎明报”报道，伊朗议会议员哈拉特巴里在最近的一次发言中，激烈地抨击美国在伊朗和中东的政策，并要求伊朗政府“重新考虑它的外交政策”。哈拉特巴里质问美国帝国主义者说：“你们究竟给了我们什么援助，你们的哪一项援助曾有助于我国的农业和工业？”
    哈拉特巴里说，“他们（指美国）给我们贷款，可是每一笔贷款都附加了成百个条件。”
    哈拉特巴里揭露所谓美国给伊朗的“援助”说，“我国收入的一半回到美国的口袋中去了”。他指出，伊朗把它的40％的石油收入给了美国。当伊朗同英国发生石油争执时，美国是站在英国一边的。
    “黎明报”说，哈拉特巴里的发言“引起德黑兰外交界和报界很大的兴趣和评论”，并“引起”德黑兰“议会人士很大的注意”。
    报纸还报道，在议会中，只有首相埃格巴尔的国家党的一个议员萨罗米发表了干巴巴的短短的发言，无力地为美国政策辩解。
