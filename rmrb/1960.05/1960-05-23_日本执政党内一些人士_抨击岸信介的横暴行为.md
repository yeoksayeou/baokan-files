Xinhua News Agency dispatch: According to Xinhua News Agency reports, two anti-Kishi faction leaders within Japan's ruling party, Tanzan Ishibashi and Kenzō Matsumura, published articles in the May 20th "Asahi Shimbun Evening Edition," strongly condemning the tyrannical measures taken by Nobusuke Kishi and other leaders of the ruling party when they forcibly "passed" the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" in the House of Representatives.

    Ishibashi accused Nobusuke Kishi and his subordinates of relying on police power and forcibly "passing" the new "Security Treaty" in the House of Representatives in the absence of opposition party members. Ishibashi said that this is by no means the attitude that a political leader who supports the parliamentary system should take.

    Ishibashi demanded Nobusuke Kishi's resignation and suggested that he be replaced by a politician who is not as fond of monopolizing power as Nobusuke Kishi.

    Ishibashi said, "In order to adjust opinions on this issue, I will meet with Kenzō Matsumura, Ichirō Kōno, and Takeo Miki."

    After criticizing House of Representatives Speaker Ichirō Kiyose for bringing the police into the Diet building, Tanzan Ishibashi pointed out that the Nobusuke Kishi group cannot shirk responsibility to others. Ishibashi accused Nobusuke Kishi of not even revealing the conspiracy to the members of the Liberal Democratic Party before carrying out the plot to pass the treaty.

    Ishibashi warned that Nobusuke Kishi had assumed too many obligations to one of the two camps, "Such one-sided reliance on the United States is extremely dangerous."

    Kenzō Matsumura said in the article that Nobusuke Kishi forcibly passed the treaty using undemocratic methods, thereby completely trampling on parliamentary democracy.

    Kenzō Matsumura said that the events that occurred in the Diet on the evening of May 19th and the morning of the 20th set a very bad example for Japanese politics.

    He said, "Passing it in a midnight meeting without sufficient deliberation is not the way a treaty should be treated. If a treaty can be passed in this way, it will not be conducive to the purpose of this treaty, which is said to promote friendship between the United States and Japan. I shudder at the thought that this treaty was passed when the majority of the people were opposing it."

    Matsumura emphasized, "We live in an era when policies based on coercion are bound to go bankrupt. Syngman Rhee is an example of this." He believes that "Now is the time for Japan to drastically change its national policy and establish moderate parliamentary democracy. In the future, all major issues concerning domestic and foreign policies should be discussed with the people."

    In addition, two members of the ruling party who did not attend the House of Representatives meeting on May 19th where the new "Security Treaty" was forcibly "passed," Masakatsu Nohara and Saburō Hirano, also spoke at a gathering of representatives from forty-two organizations in Tokyo on the 21st, criticizing the illegal actions of the Nobusuke Kishi group.

    Masakatsu Nohara said: It is not surprising that the Japanese people are angry at the Kishi government's action of forcibly "passing" the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" in the House of Representatives. He expressed that he was equally angry at the actions of the Nobusuke Kishi group and would resolutely fight against the Nobusuke Kishi government. When talking about Nobusuke Kishi's policy towards China, he said: "We cannot tolerate Nobusuke Kishi's hostile attitude towards China. We cannot entrust the Japanese government to Nobusuke Kishi and his cronies."

    Saburō Hirano stated at the meeting his determination to fight for the removal of Nobusuke Kishi from the post of president of the Liberal Democratic Party. He said that Japan should form a new government that will strive to break the deadlock in Japan-China relations.

### 日本执政党内一些人士  抨击岸信介的横暴行为

    日本执政党内一些人士
    抨击岸信介的横暴行为
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：日本执政党两个反岸派的领袖石桥湛山和松村谦三在5月20日“朝日新闻晚刊”上发表文章，强烈指责岸信介和执政党其他领导人在众议院强行“通过”新日美“安全条约”时所采取的横暴措施。
    石桥指责岸信介和他的手下人借助警察力量、在反对党议员不在场的情况下在众议院强行“通过”新“安全条约”。石桥说，这决不是支持议会制度的政治领袖应采取的态度。
    石桥要求岸信介辞职并建议由不像岸信介那么爱独揽大权的政治家来接替他。
    石桥说，“为了调整对这个问题的意见，我将会晤松村谦三、河野一郎、三木武夫。”
    石桥湛山在抨击众议院议长清濑一郎把警察引进国会大厦以后指出，岸信介集团不能把责任推卸给别人。石桥指责岸信介在执行通过条约的阴谋以前，甚至对自由民主党的议员也不透露这项阴谋。
    石桥警告说，岸信介对两个阵营中的一个承担了过多的义务，“这样片面倚赖美国是极为危险的”。
    松村谦三在文章中说，岸信介用不民主的办法强行通过条约，从而完全践踏了议会民主。
    松村谦三说，5月19日晚和20日晨在国会发生的事件给日本的政治树立了非常不好的榜样。
    他说，“不经充分审议就在午夜会议中通过，这不是对条约应当采取的办法。如果条约可以用这种办法通过，它也不会有利于据称是促进美日友谊的这个条约的目的。我一想到这个条约是在大多数人民正在反对的时候通过的，就感到不寒而栗。”
    松村着重说，“我们生活在一个建立在强制基础上的政策要破产的时代。李承晚就是这方面的一个例子。”他认为，“现在是日本急剧改变国家方针、建立适度的议会民主的时候。今后有关国内外政策的一切重大问题都应当同人民商量。”
    此外，执政党的两个没有出席5月19日强行“通过”新“安全条约”的众议院会议的国会议员野原正胜和平野三郎，在21日东京四十二团体代表的集会上也发言抨击岸信介集团的非法行为。
    野原正胜说：日本人民对于岸政府在众议院强行
  “通过”新日美“安全条约”的行动感到愤怒是毫不奇怪的。他表示他对岸信介集团的行为同样感到愤怒，并且将坚决同岸信介政府作斗争。在谈到岸信介的对华政策时，他说：“我们不能容忍岸信介对中国的敌视态度。我们不能把日本政府交托给岸信介和他的党羽。”
    平野三郎在会上表示决心为撤换岸信介的自由民主党总裁的职务而斗争。他说日本应该组成将为打破日中关系的僵局而努力的新政府。
