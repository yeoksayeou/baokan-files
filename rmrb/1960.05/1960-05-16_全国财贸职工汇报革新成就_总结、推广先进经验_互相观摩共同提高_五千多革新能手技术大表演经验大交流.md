Xinhua News Agency, May 15th: The grand National Finance and Trade Department Technical Innovation and Technical Revolution Demonstration Conference opened solemnly in the Great Hall of the People this morning.

5,127 technical innovation experts from the finance and trade front participated in today's conference with fruitful innovation achievements.

Li Xiannian, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, Ma Mingfang, Minister of the Central Finance and Trade Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, and leading comrades from central finance and trade departments and people's organizations such as Yao Yilin, Sha Qianli, Ye Jizhuang, Xu Deheng, Jin Ming, Chen Xiyu, Xu Zhizhen, Zhang Yun, and Liang Buting, as well as Cheng Hongyi, Vice Mayor of Beijing, attended today's conference and were warmly welcomed by all the representatives.

Zeng Chuanliu, Director of the Conference Preparatory Committee, delivered the opening speech first. He said that this conference is to report the achievements of technical innovation and technical revolution in the finance and trade departments to the Party and the state; to summarize, appraise, promote, and improve advanced experiences; and to promote the continued leap forward of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the finance and trade departments. The convening of this conference marks that the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the finance and trade departments has achieved initial victory and has begun to enter a new stage of continued leap forward, summary appraisal, finalization and promotion, and continuous improvement. He called on the representatives attending the conference to earnestly exchange experiences, carefully visit, learn modestly, learn from each other's strengths and make up for their weaknesses, and improve together.

Ma Mingfang, Minister of the Central Finance and Trade Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, then delivered a report to the conference. After summarizing the situation and achievements of the technical revolution movement in the national finance and trade departments in the previous stage, Ma Mingfang emphatically pointed out the future development direction of the technical revolution movement in the finance and trade departments. He said that there are two aspects to the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the finance and trade departments: on the one hand, actively supporting the technical transformation of agriculture, supporting the technical innovation and technical revolution of industry, promoting the technical innovation and technical revolution of collective welfare undertakings and life service undertakings in the whole society, and promoting the nationwide social saving movement; on the other hand, vigorously carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution in various units, enterprises, and business links within the finance and trade departments. It is necessary to do a good job in the technical innovation and technical revolution of the finance and trade departments themselves, and also to promote the technical innovation and technical revolution of the whole society, and to closely combine the two aspects, promote each other, and complement each other.

Ma Mingfang emphasized that in the movement to increase production and practice economy centered on technical innovation and technical revolution, the finance and trade departments should pay special attention to actively supporting the technical transformation of agriculture. The finance and trade departments should do everything possible to support the mechanization, water conservancy, and electrification of agriculture from the aspects of participating in planning, participating in production, providing technology, raising funds, supplying materials, and doing a good job in maintenance and repair; they should promote the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery through the establishment of commodity bases, through the movement of agricultural product procurement, through the "small summer harvest" and "small autumn harvest" movements, and through the agricultural and sideline product processing movement, and assist in arranging the production layout of various crops such as grain, cotton, oil, hemp, silk, tea, sugar, vegetables, tobacco, fruits, medicine, and miscellaneous crops; they should vigorously support the rapid development of rural people's communes' industries, help commune-run industries break through the raw material barrier, equipment barrier, and technical barrier, participate in and promote the implementation of economic accounting and improved management in commune-run industries, and strengthen the equipment of agriculture by equipping commune-run industries.

Ma Mingfang also pointed out that in the movement to consolidate and develop rural people's communes and establish urban people's communes, the finance and trade departments should become a strong assistant to the Party committees at all levels in comprehensively organizing people's lives, and should actively help the people in cities and villages to carry out technical innovation and technical revolution in collective welfare undertakings and life service undertakings, in order to save a lot of social living labor and materialized labor, and promote the socialization of housework and the collectivization of life. The finance and trade departments should also actively participate in and promote the nationwide social saving movement of saving grain, saving coal, and saving cotton cloth, in order to save a lot of material wealth for society.

In the last part of his report, Ma Mingfang pointed out six issues that should be emphasized in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement of the finance and trade departments:

First, under the leadership of the Party, continue to adhere to putting politics in command and vigorously carry out mass movements. The technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the finance and trade departments should be closely integrated with the central tasks of the Party in various periods and serve the central work.

Second, summarizing and appraising, finalizing and coordinating, grasping the key points, and comprehensively promoting are important links for the further development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the finance and trade departments at present. In popularizing and promoting, it is necessary to grasp the key points. The so-called key points are those projects that can save the maximum amount of living labor and materialized labor, are the simplest to manufacture, use the least materials, have the lowest cost, and are the easiest to learn and promote. Closely combine the key points with the general, use the key points to drive the general, have both points and areas, and promote each other.

Third, adhere to the idea of ​​constant revolution, constantly innovating and constantly improving. The law of technical innovation and technical revolution is: popularization, improvement, re-popularization, re-improvement, repeated cycles, and endless, constantly developing to a higher stage. Mastering this idea can guide the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the finance and trade departments to move forward continuously in wave after wave.

Fourth, the policy of combining foreign and indigenous methods should continue to be implemented. The finance and trade departments have many institutions, are widely distributed, and generally have a relatively low technical level. It is very important to adopt the method of starting with indigenous methods and gradually improving. Starting with indigenous methods, equipment can be simple and easy to create, and raw materials are also easy to solve. As long as you use your brain to think of ways, you can do it everywhere. We must resolutely implement the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods, which is the best way to fully mobilize all positive factors and carry out technical innovation and technical revolution in a faster, better, and more economical way.

Fifth, adhere to the principle of self-reliance.

Sixth, widely launch a mass movement to study Chairman Mao's works and study cultural science and technology.

Finally, Ma Mingfang hoped that the representatives participating in this technical demonstration conference would learn modestly, study diligently, guard against arrogance and impetuosity, learn from each other's strengths and make up for their weaknesses, improve together, give full play to their leading role, backbone role, and bridge role, become a shock force for further launching a climax of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the finance and trade departments, and work with the national finance and trade workers to make the advanced seeds of the conference bloom and bear fruit in every corner of the country.

    全国财贸职工汇报革新成就　总结、推广先进经验　互相观摩共同提高
    五千多革新能手技术大表演经验大交流
    据新华社15日讯　规模盛大的全国财贸部门技术革新和技术革命表演大会，今天上午在人民大会堂隆重开幕。
    五千一百二十七名来自财贸战线上的技术革新能手，带着丰硕的革新成果，参加了今天的大会。
    中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理李先念，中共中央财政贸易工作部部长马明方和中央财贸各部门、各人民团体负责人姚依林、沙千里、叶季壮、许德珩、金明、陈希愈、许之桢、章蕴、梁步庭和北京市副市长程宏毅等负责同志出席了今天的大会，受到全体代表的热烈欢迎。
    大会筹委会主任曾传六首先致开幕词。他说，这次大会是向党和国家汇报财贸各部门技术革新和技术革命成就；总结、鉴定、推广和提高先进经验；推动财贸各部门的技术革新和技术革命运动继续跃进。这次大会的召开，标志着财贸各部门的技术革新和技术革命运动已经取得初步胜利，开始进入一个继续跃进、总结鉴定、定型推广和不断提高的新阶段。他号召参加大会的代表认真交流经验、细致参观、虚心学习，取长补短，共同提高。
    中共中央财政贸易工作部部长马明方接着向大会做了报告。马明方在综述了全国财贸部门前一阶段技术革命运动的形势和成就后，着重指出了今后财贸部门技术革命运动的发展方向。他说，财贸部门的技术革新和技术革命运动有两个方面：一方面是积极支援农业的技术改造，支援工业的技术革新和技术革命，促进全社会的集体福利事业和生活服务事业的技术革新和技术革命，促进全民性的社会节约运动；另一个方面是大力开展财贸部门内部各单位、各企业、各业务环节上的技术革新和技术革命。既要搞好财贸部门本身的技术革新和技术革命，又要促进全社会的技术革新和技术革命，并且把两个方面密切地结合起来，互相推动，相辅相成。
    马明方强调说，在以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动中，财贸部门要特别注意积极支援农业的技术改造。财贸部门应当千方百计地从参与规划、参与生产、提供技术、筹集资金、供应物资、搞好修配方面，支援农业的机械化、水利化、电气化；应当通过建立商品基地的工作，通过农产品收购运动，通过“小夏收”、“小秋收”运动，通过农副产品加工运动，促进农、林、牧、副、渔的全面发展，协助安排粮、棉、油、麻、丝、茶、糖、菜、烟、果、药、杂等各种农作物的生产布局，应当大力支援农村人民公社的工业的迅速发展，帮助社办工业突破原料关、设备关、技术关，参与和促进社办工业实行经济核算、改善经营管理，通过装备社办工业的办法来加强装备农业。
    马明方又指出，在巩固发展农村人民公社和建立城市人民公社的运动中，财贸部门应当成为各级党委全面组织人民生活的有力助手，应当积极帮助城市和农村的人民开展集体福利事业和生活服务事业的技术革新和技术革命，以节约大量的社会活劳动和物化劳动，促进家务劳动社会化、生活集体化。财贸部门还应当积极参与和促进节约粮食、节约煤炭、节约棉布等全民性的社会节约运动，为社会节约大量的物质财富。
    马明方在报告最后一部分指出了财贸部门的技术革新和技术革命运动中，应当重视的六个问题：
    第一、在党的领导下，继续坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动。财贸部门的技术革新和技术革命运动，应当与各个时期党的中心任务密切结合，为中心工作服务。
    第二、总结鉴定，定型配套，抓住重点，全面推广，这是当前财贸部门技术革新和技术革命运动进一步发展的重要环节。在普及推广中，要抓住重点。所谓重点，就是能够最大限度地节约活劳动和物化劳动、制造最简便、用料最少、成本最低、最便于学习推广的项目。把重点和一般密切地结合起来，以重点带动一般，有点有面，互相促进。
    第三、坚持不断革命的思想，不断革新、不断提高。技术革新和技术革命的规律是：普及、提高，再普及、再提高，循环往复，以至无穷，不断地向更高的阶段发展。掌握这一思想，就能够指导财贸部门的技术革新和技术革命运动，一浪推一浪地不断前进。
    第四、应当继续贯彻洋土并举的方针。财贸部门机构多、分布广，技术水平一般比较低，采用土法上马，逐步提高的办法，是很重要的。土法上马，设备可以因陋就简，比较容易创制，原料材料也容易解决，只要动脑筋想办法，到处都能搞。我们必须坚决贯彻土洋并举互相结合的方针，这是充分调动一切积极因素，多快好省地开展技术革新和技术革命的最好途径。
    第五、坚持自力更生为主的原则。
    第六、广泛地掀起一个学习毛主席著作和学习文化科学技术的群众运动。
    马明方最后希望参加这次技术表演大会的代表虚心学习、刻苦钻研、戒骄戒躁、取长补短、共同提高，充分发挥带头作用、骨干作用和桥梁作用，成为进一步掀起财贸部门技术革新和技术革命运动高潮的突击队，和全国财贸职工一道，使大会的先进种子在全国各个角落开花结果。
