    Beijing Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Goes All Out in Teaching Equipment Innovation
    The basic course teaching and research departments of Beijing Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics have achieved more than 30 technical innovations in various teaching aids and equipment.
    The teachers of the Mathematics Teaching and Research Department actively looked for ways to find materials, learning by doing, overcoming many difficulties, and finally made electrical teaching aids for explaining the concept of "limit", and a "universal teaching aid" for explaining analytic geometry. This "universal teaching aid" can replace the various bulky teaching aids used in the past for teaching "single-sheet hyperboloid" and "vertical cone surface". Since ancient times, teachers have had to eat chalk dust. This time, they trial-produced "automatic circulating erasable blackboard" and "native blackboard erasers", which can not only avoid chalk dust flying around, but also save effort and time.

    北京航空学院大闹教具革新
    北京航空学院基础课各教研室，实现了三十多项各种教具和设备的技术革新。
    数学教研室的教师们，积极想办法找材料，边做边学，克服了很多困难，终于制成讲解“极限”概念用的电化教具，和讲解解析几何用的“万能教具”。这种“万能教具”可以代替过去讲“单叶双曲面”“对顶锥面”等用的多种笨重的教具。做教师自古以来要吃粉笔灰，这次他们试制成“循环自动擦式黑板”和“土板擦”，既可避免粉笔灰飞扬，又可以省力省时间。
