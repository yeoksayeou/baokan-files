Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, May 21st: Cambodian Prince Sihanouk published an "Open Letter to Imperialists" in the "Nationalist" weekly magazine on May 21st, condemning imperialist attacks on Cambodia.

The letter stated that imperialist elements are frantically attacking neutral Cambodia, claiming that Cambodia has no democracy, unlike South Korea, Thailand, Pakistan, South Vietnam, and Taiwan. He also said that an article by Tillman Durdin published in the American "New York Times" attacked Cambodia, saying that Sihanouk's neutralism "is not popular among some people, and therefore violent incidents against his regime occur from time to time."

Sihanouk said in the letter that the ill-intentioned words in the "New York Times" article are not the first imperialist attacks on Cambodia. In fact, Cambodia often sees this kind of argument in the imperialist newspapers, in the newspapers of the imperialists' lackeys (such as in Thai newspapers), and in Khmer leaflets distributed by traitors like Sam Sary and Son Ngoc Thanh who receive wages from the imperialists. The letter condemned the imperialists, saying, "In order to spread this malicious argument that you are accustomed to, you fully utilize your financial means, you hire a group of reporters and writers to compile a set of works that serve you, such as ‘Cambodia and its People, Society and Culture,’ to distribute widely to those who want to understand the situation and attitude of Cambodia. In addition, your supporters also distributed a work about Cambodia written by a diplomat named Martin Herz, the sole purpose of which is to slander me personally, distort our country's neutrality, and praise Son Ngoc Thanh." The letter stated that neither the Khmer nation nor I myself can agree to openly compare Cambodia with the most loyal servants of the imperialists. The letter said, "Our policy of neutrality is not our personal will, but the will of 4.5 million Cambodians, that is to say, the will of the entire Khmer people except for a small group of those who act as your servants."

The letter also stated that imperialists are trying everything possible to make people believe that some people in Cambodia are dissatisfied with the country's neutral and friendly policy with socialist countries. It said, "In fact, you know better than anyone else that these dissatisfied people are not the Khmer people, but those who have been bought by imperialism with money. The Khmer people, with disgust and anger, have resolutely kicked these people out of the national family."

The letter, after pointing out that imperialists have already suffered "indecent failures" in various parts of Asia, said that the United States should understand that the primary source of its failures "should be found in its own blind policies, actions, articles, and speeches, in a word, should be found in the malice of the imperialists."

### 西哈努克亲王发表公开信  谴责帝国主义分子攻击柬埔寨  并揭露“纽约时报”散布存心不良的论调

    西哈努克亲王发表公开信
    谴责帝国主义分子攻击柬埔寨
    并揭露“纽约时报”散布存心不良的论调
    新华社金边21日电　柬埔寨西哈努克亲王21日在“民族主义者”周刊上发表“致帝国主义分子的公开信”，谴责帝国主义者对柬埔寨的攻击。
    信中说，帝国主义分子们疯狂地攻击中立的柬埔寨，说什么柬埔寨毫无民主，不像南朝鲜、泰国、巴基斯坦、南越、台湾那样。他还说：美国“纽约时报”发表的蒂尔曼·窦丁的文章攻击柬埔寨说，西哈努克的中立主义“在某些人士中间并不受欢迎，因此不时发生反对他的政权的暴力事件”。
    西哈努克在信中说，“纽约时报”的文章中存心不良的字句并不是帝国主义分子第一次对柬埔寨的攻击。事实上柬埔寨在帝国主义者的报纸上，在帝国主义者的仆从者的报纸上（例如在泰国的报纸上），以及在向帝国主义者领饷的像桑萨里、山玉成之流的卖国贼所散发的高棉文的传单上，经常看到这种论调。这封信谴责帝国主义者说，“为了传播你们习以为常的这种恶意论调，你们充分利用你们的财政手段，你们雇佣了一批记者和作家来编出一套为你们服务的作品，如
  ‘柬埔寨及其人民、社会和文化’，向那些想了解柬埔寨情况和态度的人广为散发。此外，你们的支持者还散发了一篇由一位名叫马丁·赫茨的外交官所写的关于柬埔寨的作品，这篇作品的唯一目的是诬蔑我个人，歪曲我国的中立，颂扬山玉成。”信中说：无论是高棉民族或我本人，我们都不能同意人们公然把柬埔寨同帝国主义者最忠实的奴仆相比拟。信中说，“我们的中立政策并不是我们的个人意愿，而是四百五十万柬埔寨人的意愿，即是说除掉一小撮充当你们仆从的那些人而外的全体高棉人民的意愿。”
    这封信还说，帝国主义者想尽一切办法使人们相信：柬埔寨有一些人不满这个国家的中立和同社会主义国家友好的政策。它说，“事实上，你们比谁都清楚地知道，这些不满的人并非高棉的人民，而是被帝国主义用金钱所收买的那些人。高棉人民怀着厌恶和愤怒的心情，已经毅然把这些人踢出了民族大家庭之外。”
    这封信在指出帝国主义者已经在亚洲各地遭到“不体面的失败”之后说：美国应该了解，其所以遭到失败，“首要的根源应该从它们自己所奉行的盲目的政策、行为、文章和言论中去找，一句话，应该从帝国主义者的恶意中去找。”
