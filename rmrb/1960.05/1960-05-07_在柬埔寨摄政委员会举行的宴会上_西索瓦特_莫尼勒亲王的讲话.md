Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, May 5th. The full text of the speech by Prince Sisowath Monireth, Chairman of the Cambodian Regency Council, at the banquet welcoming Premier Zhou Enlai, is as follows:

    Mr. Premier,

    I am pleased to welcome you, a distinguished representative of a great friendly nation, on behalf of the Regency Council, and to express to you our delight at having you and Marshal Chen Yi, and the distinguished persons accompanying you, with us tonight.

    Your visit to Cambodia in the course of a peace mission, the full significance of which we understand, is proof of a most precious friendship, to which we on our part are resolutely faithful.

    At this moment, as Chairman of the Regency Council, I must express to you how grateful we—Her Majesty the Queen, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the Royal Family, myself, and the entire Cambodian people—are for the moving condolences you so sincerely expressed a few hours ago to our late and venerable King.

    We have no doubt that this most solemn and great gesture will further enhance the prestige you have already won among us through your amiable character and the courteous attitude shown in every one of your actions, and will help to increase the respect and esteem you have long enjoyed among our people.

    Mr. Premier, I need hardly say how grateful we are for the unwavering friendship that you and the Chinese people have consistently shown us over the years, a friendship that has been beneficial to our country.

    The position your government has taken with us has been of inestimable help in our constant struggle, often in very difficult circumstances, to defend our national independence and to ensure respect for our policy of neutrality.

    Like the People's Republic of China, Cambodia has always firmly believed that peace can be saved through goodwill between nations, direct contact between statesmen, and strict adherence to the principles proclaimed at Bandung.

    Therefore, for us, we can only applaud any effort aimed at promoting a relaxation of the international situation, and any effort aimed at facilitating the holding of talks that are beneficial to the future of our people.

    May we in the near future see the establishment of friendship between the peoples of Asia and the world, because the peoples of Asia and the world, like our people, hope to promote the happiness and welfare of mankind in understanding and sincere cooperation.

    It is with this fervent hope that I ask Your Highnesses, Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,

    To the health of His Excellency Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the People's Republic of China,

    To the health of His Excellency Mao Zedong, the liberator of Chinese territory and Chairman of the Communist Party of China,

    To the health of His Excellency Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China,

    To the health of Marshal Chen Yi and all members of the Chinese delegation present,

    Cheers!

    Long live the People's Republic of China!

    Long live the eternal friendship between China and Cambodia!

    在柬埔寨摄政委员会举行的宴会上
    西索瓦特·莫尼勒亲王的讲话
    新华社金边5日电　柬埔寨摄政委员会主席西索瓦特·莫尼勒亲王在欢迎周恩来总理的宴会上的讲话，全文如下：总理先生，
    我高兴地以摄政委员会的名义欢迎您——一个伟大的友好国家的杰出的代表，并向您表达我们由于今晚能有您和陈毅元帅先生以及陪同您的著名人士的光临而感到的高兴。
    您在执行我们了解其全部意义的和平使命的过程中来到柬埔寨，是极其宝贵的友谊的证明，我们这一方面是坚决地忠实于这种友谊的。
    在这个时刻，我作为摄政委员会主席，应该向您表示我们——王后陛下、诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王、王室和我本人以及柬埔寨全国人民对于您在几小时以前十分恳切地向我们已故的尊严的国王陛下所表达的令人感动的吊唁，是多么感激。
    我们毫不怀疑，这种极其庄严和伟大的举动，将进一步提高您已经由于您的和蔼可亲的性格以及您的每一个举动所表现出的彬彬有礼的态度而在我们中间赢得的威信，而且将有助于增加您很早以前就在我国人民中享有的尊敬和尊重。
    总理先生，我用不着说，我们感激您和中国人民几年来不断对我们表示的忠诚的友谊，这种友谊对我们的国家是有利的。
    您的政府对我们所采取的这种立场，对于我们往往不得不在十分困难的情况下为保卫我们的民族独立、并使我国的中立政策受到尊重而不断进行的斗争，是无可估量的帮助。
    像中华人民共和国一样，柬埔寨始终深信，和平可以通过各国相互之间的良好意愿、各国政治家之间的直接接触和严格遵循在万隆宣布的那些原则而得到挽救。
    因此，对我们来说，我们只能鼓掌欢迎一切旨在促成国际局势开始缓和的任何努力，以及旨在促成举行对我国人民前途有利的会谈的任何努力。
    但愿我们在不久的将来，就能看到在亚洲和世界各国人民之间建立起友谊，因为亚洲和世界各国人民，像我国人民一样，希望在谅解和真诚合作之中来促进人类的幸福和福利。
    我就是怀着这种热烈的希望，敬请殿下、各位阁下、诸位先生们，
    为中华人民共和国主席刘少奇阁下的健康，
    为中国领土的解放者、中国共产党主席毛泽东阁下的健康，
    为中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来阁下的健康，
    为陈毅元帅阁下以及在座的中国代表团的所有成员的健康，
    干杯。
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中柬两国的永恒友谊万岁！
