Xinhua News Agency, May 13th - The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China today issued a statement regarding the intrusion of U.S. military aircraft into our airspace, as follows:

    Following the 95th serious warning issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China on May 11th regarding the intrusion of a U.S. Navy patrol aircraft into the airspace over Yongxing Island in the Xisha Islands of Guangdong Province, the U.S. government immediately defended its military provocation of invading our airspace. U.S. State Department spokesman White stated that the U.S. government had not learned whether a U.S. Navy aircraft had indeed intruded into the airspace over the island. At the same time, White blatantly declared that the Xisha Islands are not Chinese territory. Other U.S. officials also stated that the U.S. Seventh Fleet has the responsibility to protect the security of the South China Sea. Following May 11th, a U.S. Navy patrol aircraft again intruded into the airspace over our Xisha Islands on May 13th. This is a blatant expression of U.S. imperialism continuing to be hostile to the Chinese people and deliberately intensifying the tension in the Far East.

    The Xisha Islands are Chinese territory. The Chinese government has issued solemn statements on this matter on several occasions. Of the 96 serious warnings we have issued to the United States, 19 were issued due to U.S. aircraft intruding into the airspace over our Xisha Islands. Therefore, no matter how the U.S. government's spokesperson attempts to confuse the public, it cannot conceal the fact that the U.S. has invaded Chinese airspace. U.S. officials claim that invading China's territorial sovereignty is its "responsibility to protect the security of the South China Sea," which fully exposes the shameless aggressive face of U.S. imperialism. The intrusion of U.S. military aircraft into Chinese airspace, no matter how it is justified, cannot be denied.

    It should be pointed out that the repeated intrusions of U.S. imperialist military aircraft into Chinese airspace are serious provocations against the Chinese people. It has long aroused great anger among the Chinese people. These provocative activities by the U.S. government fully demonstrate that the aggressive and bellicose nature of the U.S. government has not and will not change. The Chinese people must heighten their vigilance a hundredfold and, together with peace-loving people all over the world, resolutely oppose this military provocation by U.S. imperialism.

    Xinhua News Agency, May 13th, Washington Dispatch: U.S. State Department spokesperson White attempted to deny the fact that a U.S. Navy patrol aircraft intruded into Chinese airspace over the Xisha Islands on May 11th and blatantly attempted to obliterate China's sacred sovereignty over the Xisha Islands.

    At a press conference, White prevaricated when discussing the serious warning issued by the Chinese government regarding this blatant act of military provocation by the United States, claiming that they had not learned whether a U.S. Navy aircraft had indeed flown over the island. He even argued that the Xisha Islands are not Chinese territory, nonsensically claiming that these islands have not been permanently occupied by any country, "therefore, I don't quite understand how this can be considered an infringement on the territory of the Chinese Communists." On the same day that White was making excuses for invading Chinese airspace, other U.S. officials in Washington issued frantic aggressive calls in response to China's stern warning to the United States. They said that the U.S. Seventh Fleet has the "responsibility to protect the security of the South China Sea" and is conducting so-called "normal patrols" in the area.

    我外交部发言人就美机侵犯我领空问题发表谈话   
    坚决反对美帝国主义军事挑衅
    美机屡犯西沙群岛蓄意与中国人民为敌并加剧远东紧张局势充分说明美国政府的侵略和好战本质完全没有也不会有改变
    新华社13日讯　中华人民共和国外交部发言人今天就美国军用飞机侵犯我国领空问题发表谈话如下：
    中华人民共和国外交部5月11日就美国海军巡逻飞机侵入我广东省西沙群岛的永兴岛上空提出第九十五次严重警告后，美国政府立即对它侵犯我国领空的这种军事挑衅行为进行辩解。美国国务院发言人怀特声明说，美国政府没有获悉究竟美国海军飞机是否确实侵犯了这个岛屿的上空。同时，怀特竟公然宣称，西沙群岛不是我国的领土。美国其他的官员还说什么美国第七舰队负有保卫南中国海安全的责任。继5月11日之后，美国海军巡逻飞机又在5月13日侵犯我国西沙群岛上空。这是美帝国主义继续同中国人民为敌并蓄意加剧远东紧张局势的露骨表示。
    西沙群岛是中国的领土。中国政府对此曾先后数次发表庄严的声明。在我国对美国的  九十六次严重警告中，有十九次是由于美国飞机侵犯我西沙群岛上空后提出的。因此，无论美国政府的发言人如何企图混淆视听，丝毫也不能掩盖美国侵犯中国领空的这一事实。美国的官员把侵犯中国的领土主权说成是它“有保卫南中国海安全的责任”，这就充分暴露了美帝国主义无耻的侵略面目。美国军用飞机对中国领空的侵犯行为，不管它怎样狡辩，那是抵赖不了的。
    应该指出，美帝国主义的军用飞机对中国领空的一再侵犯，是对中国人民的严重的挑衅。它早已引起了中国人民的极大愤怒。美国政府的这些挑衅活动，也充分说明，美国政府的侵略和好战的本质完全没有也不会有改变。中国人民必须百倍地提高警惕，同全世界爱好和平的人民一道，坚决反对美帝国主义的这种军事挑衅。
    新华社13日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院发言人怀特11日力图抵赖美国海军巡逻机11日侵入中国西沙群岛上空的事实，并且公然企图抹杀中国对西沙群岛的神圣主权。
    怀特在记者招待会上在谈到中国政府对美国这个明目张胆的军事挑衅行动提出严重警告时推诿说，他们没有获悉究竟一架美国海军飞机是否确实飞越这个岛屿。他竟然认为西沙群岛不是中国的领土，胡说什么这些岛屿并没有被任何国家永久占领，“因此我不很了解，这怎么能算是对中国共产党领土的侵犯”。在怀特狡赖侵犯中国领空的同一天，华盛顿的其他美国官员针对中国对美国的严正警告发出猖狂的侵略叫嚣。他们说，美国的第七舰队负有“保卫南中国海安全的责任”，并且正在这个地区进行所谓“正常的巡逻”。
