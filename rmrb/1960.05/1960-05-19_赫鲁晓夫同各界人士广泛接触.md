Xinhua News Agency, May 18th dispatch: TASS, Paris dispatch: Soviet Premier Khrushchev held a brief conversation on the morning of the 17th with reporters who were almost constantly stationed outside the Soviet Embassy.

Answering questions from reporters at an impromptu press conference on the narrow Rue de Grenelle, Khrushchev reiterated that the Soviet Union would only participate in the summit under these circumstances: The United States acknowledges that it sent military reconnaissance aircraft to Soviet airspace to carry out espionage missions, thus committing aggression, publicly apologizes, condemns its actions, and declares that such incidents will not happen again. Khrushchev said that otherwise, we will go home.

He also said that we may fly away tomorrow, and on the way, we will stop in Berlin, where I want to visit our friends Walter Ulbricht, Otto Grotewohl, and others.

Khrushchev also told reporters that he would not leave Paris without saying goodbye to them at a press conference.

Shortly after this conversation, an announcement was made to reporters: Khrushchev and Malinovsky intended to visit the village of Pleurs near Sézanne, where Malinovsky had been from March to August 1919, when he was a soldier of the 20th Regiment of the 1st Brigade of the Russian Expeditionary Force, fighting with the French against the German army on the Western Front.

Visiting the village of Pleurs with Marshal Malinovsky

Xinhua News Agency, May 18th dispatch: TASS, Paris, May 17th dispatch: Khrushchev and Marshal Malinovsky visited this morning a village near the city of Sézanne, one hundred and twenty kilometers from Paris—Pleurs. Marshal Malinovsky lived in this village in 1919 as an ordinary soldier in the Russian Expeditionary Force. A large number of reporters accompanied Khrushchev on the visit.

Khrushchev traveled in an open car. He was immediately recognized, and welcomed everywhere as if he were a good friend. Before they even reached the city of Sézanne, the car stopped, and many workers felling trees by the roadside welcomed them. Khrushchev got out of the car and greeted them. A worker warmly shook Khrushchev's hand. He said, my name is Caroza, and I recognized you immediately. Khrushchev jokingly asked him: "Is your axe easy to use?" Then Khrushchev picked up the axe and chopped branches off a tree. Caroza happily shouted: "Look, there's a worker here!" Khrushchev then spoke with an ordinary woman standing by the roadside, asking about her family situation.

Khrushchev's appearance in the village of Pleurs caused a sensation throughout the village. The news "Khrushchev is here!" spread immediately, and people surrounded the car Khrushchev was riding in. Khrushchev said in French: "Long live peace!" This sentence was approved by everyone. The visit of Khrushchev and his party lasted for more than an hour. The people of the whole village diligently accompanied the distinguished guests. When returning to their residence, many people stood on the roadside and cheered Khrushchev.

    他还说，我们可能明天乘飞机离开，途中我们将在柏林停留，在那里我想探望我们的朋友瓦尔特·乌布利希、奥托·格罗提渥等人。
    赫鲁晓夫还对记者们说，不在记者招待会上同他们告别，他将不会离开巴黎。
