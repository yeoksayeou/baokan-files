	Nanjing's Light Industry and Textile System Strives for Products to Rank Among the National Advanced
	The mass movement of "comparing with famous brands, catching up with famous brands, surpassing famous brands, and creating famous brands" in Nanjing's light industry and textile industry systems has achieved new successes. Since the first quarter, more than 340 new products have been trial-produced. Among them, 49 kinds of products have caught up with or surpassed domestic famous brands, such as Nanjing brand batteries, Peony brand pomade, Harvest brand thermos bottles, Red Flower brand high-grade glassware, Rose brand wool yarn, Worker-Peasant-Soldier brand underwear, etc. Newly created high-grade and precision new products with distinctive styles include Jinling brand sweet beer, Nanjing brand 59-type Panlong gold pen, Red Flower brand colored decal set cups, famous dish canned food, double-sided yarn-dyed khaki drill, double-thread mercerized bed sheets, gold thread velvet, and brocade opera costumes, totaling 37 kinds.
	Since the beginning of this year, with the rapid development of the magnificent technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the spirit of communism of daring to think and daring to act among the vast number of workers and staff in Nanjing's light industry and textile industry has been further promoted. They bravely took Shanghai, which has the best foundation in the national light industry and textile industry, as the object of their pursuit. Although Zhengming Battery Factory has only been producing batteries for a few years, they are determined to learn and catch up with the Shanghai famous brand "Da Wu Wei" (Fearless) battery, which has a history of 40 years.
	In carrying out this movement, the workers and staff of Nanjing's light industry and textile industry have received selfless assistance from similar enterprises in Shanghai. Many factories in Shanghai have enthusiastically provided support in terms of technology, equipment, and raw materials. For example, Shanghai Yifeng Enamel Factory often provides Nanjing Zijinshan Enamel Factory with the latest pattern designs, so that the enamel basins produced by Zijinshan Factory quickly caught up with the domestic advanced level in several main indicators.

### 敢比　敢赶　敢超　敢创造  南京轻工和纺织系统力争产品跃居全国先进行列

    敢比　敢赶　敢超　敢创造
    南京轻工和纺织系统力争产品跃居全国先进行列
    南京市轻工业和纺织工业系统的“比名牌、赶名牌、超名牌、创名牌”的群众运动，又取得新成就。第一季度以来，试制成新产品三百四十多种。其中赶上或超过国内名牌产品的有南京牌电池、牡丹牌香脂、丰收牌保温瓶、红花牌高级玻璃器皿、玫瑰牌绒线、工农兵牌内衣等四十九种。新创造的别具风格的高级、精密的新产品有金陵牌甜啤酒、南京牌五九型蟠龙金笔、红花牌色素贴花套料杯、名菜罐头、双面纱卡、双线丝光被单、金线绒、云锦戏衣等三十七种。
    今年以来，随着波澜壮阔的技术革新和技术革命运动的迅速发展，南京市轻工业和纺织工业广大职工敢想敢干的共产主义风格进一步发扬，勇敢地把全国轻工、纺织工业基础最好的上海作为追赶的对象。正明电池厂生产电池虽然只有几年历史，但他们下决心学习，赶上有四十年历史的上海名牌产品“大无畏”电池。
    南京轻工、纺织工业职工在开展这项运动中，得到了上海同类企业的无私援助。上海许多工厂都从技术、设备、原料等方面热情地给予支持。例如上海益丰搪瓷厂经常为南京紫金山搪瓷厂提供最新的花色设计，从而使紫金山厂生产的搪瓷面盆在几个主要指标方面，很快赶上了国内先进水平。
