    The summit conference of the heads of state of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France begins today in Paris. The task facing this conference is to seek ways to resolve current major international issues (such as disarmament, the prohibition of nuclear testing, the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the West Berlin issue, and the improvement of East-West relations). Undoubtedly, the resolution of these issues will be of great significance for easing international tensions and maintaining world peace. It is entirely understandable that people all over the world are looking forward to this conference. The Chinese people, like the people of all countries, have consistently supported the convening of the four-power summit. Chairman Mao Zedong said on May 14:
    “We support the convening of the summit conference, regardless of whether such a conference achieves anything or how much it achieves.” This is our attitude.
    The convening of the four-power summit is a victory for the struggle of the people of the world to ease international tensions and maintain world peace. As everyone knows, the US government, headed by Eisenhower, has always been unwilling to hold a four-power summit. When the Soviet Union proposed holding a four-power summit in 1957, the US government used various excuses to oppose it. At the Geneva Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference from May to August last year, the United States still used unreasonable preconditions such as the Foreign Ministers' Conference "must make progress" and "the rights of West Berlin must not be abandoned" to obstruct the convening of the four-power summit. Even Eisenhower himself did not agree to hold a summit conference until September 10 last year. Later, only under the pressure of world public opinion, the US government was forced to accept the Soviet proposal and agreed to hold a four-power summit.
    However, people cannot fail to see that after reluctantly agreeing to hold a four-power summit, the US government continues to obstruct the resolution of major international issues. US officials have repeatedly stated that they "will not abandon their rights in Berlin" and insist that holding so-called "free elections" is the "only practical way" to solve the German problem. At the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee meeting and the US-UK-Soviet Union talks on the cessation of nuclear weapon tests, the United States also insisted on its stubborn position and obstructed the reaching of an agreement. Senior US government officials such as Secretary of State Herter are also doing their best to spread pessimism, urging people of all countries not to "have excessive hopes" for the four-power summit. On the eve of the four-power summit, the US government even sent aircraft to invade Soviet airspace to carry out provocations. It is very clear that the United States harbors ill intentions towards the four-power summit. The people of the world must remain vigilant against the US's sabotage conspiracy, must continue to expose the US's policy of aggression and war, and must strengthen the struggle to ease international tensions.
    Contrary to the attitude of the United States, the Soviet government has consistently worked to convene a four-power summit. It is precisely because of the efforts of peace-loving people all over the world, especially the unremitting efforts of the Soviet Union, that the four-power summit can be held today. Moreover, the Soviet Union has also made great efforts to reach an agreement at the four-power summit. Even after US aircraft invaded Soviet airspace and carried out blatant provocations, the Soviet government still expressed its willingness to work to ensure the success of the four-power summit. The Soviet government's efforts to convene a great power conference have always been actively supported by China and other socialist countries. Now that the four-power summit has begun, the Chinese people firmly support the Soviet government's positive attitude in striving to ease international tensions and resolve major international issues. The Chinese people, like the people of the world, although we do not harbor any unrealistic illusions about imperialism headed by the United States, we still sincerely hope that through the four-power summit, beneficial contributions can be made in exposing the US war policy and promoting world peace.

### 欢迎四国首脑会议的召开

    欢迎四国首脑会议的召开
    苏、美、英、法四国首脑会议今天开始在巴黎举行。寻求解决当前重大国际问题（例如裁军问题、禁止核试验问题、缔结对德和约和西柏林问题以及改善东西方关系问题等）的途径是这次会议面临的任务。毫无疑问，这些问题的解决，将对于和缓国际紧张局势和维护世界和平有着重大的意义。全世界人民期待这次会议的召开，是完全可以理解的。中国人民同世界各国人民一样，一贯支持四国首脑会议的召开。毛泽东主席5月14日说：
  “我们支持首脑会议的召开，不管这种会议有无成就和成就的大小”。这就是我们的态度。
    四国首脑会议的召开，是全世界人民争取缓和国际紧张局势和维护世界和平斗争的一个胜利。大家知道，以艾森豪威尔为首的美国政府本来一直是不愿意举行四国首脑会议的。当1957年苏联提出召开四国首脑会议建议的时候，美国政府就曾用各种借口来加以反对。去年5月到8月在日内瓦四国外长会议上，美国仍然以外长会议
  “必须取得进展”、“西柏林权利不得放弃”等无理的先决条件来阻挠四国首脑会议的召开。甚至艾森豪威尔本人直到去年9月10日还不同意召开首脑会议。后来，只是在全世界舆论的压力下，美国政府才被迫接受了苏联的建议，同意举行四国首脑会议。
    但是，人们不能不看到，美国政府在勉强同意了举行四国首脑会议之后，仍然继续阻挠重大的国际问题的解决。美国的负责官员一再表示“不放弃在柏林的权利”，坚持举行所谓“自由选举”是解决德国问题的“唯一切实可行的办法”。在十国裁军委员会会议和美英苏三国不继续试验核武器会上，美国也同样坚持它的顽固立场，阻挠达成协议。美国的政府高级官员如国务卿赫脱并且竭力散布悲观空气，要各国人民不要对四国首脑会议“抱有过分的希望”。而在四国首脑会议的前夕，美国政府甚至派遣飞机侵犯苏联领空进行挑衅。美国对四国首脑会议不怀好意，是十分明显的。全世界人民必须对美国的破坏阴谋保持警惕，必须继续揭露美国的侵略政策和战争政策，必须为争取缓和国际紧张局势而加强斗争。
    同美国的态度相反，苏联政府一贯为召开四国首脑会议而努力。正是由于全世界爱好和平人民的努力，特别是苏联的不懈的努力，四国首脑会议今天才能够举行。而且为了争取四国首脑会议达成协议，苏联也尽了很大的努力。就在美国飞机侵入苏联领空，进行明目张胆的挑衅之后，苏联政府仍然表示愿意努力促使四国首脑会议取得成功。苏联政府为召开大国会议而进行的努力，一向得到中国和其他社会主义国家的积极支持。现在四国首脑会议开始举行了，中国人民坚决支持苏联政府为争取缓和国际紧张局势、争取解决重大国际问题的积极态度。中国人民和全世界人民一样，尽管我们对于以美国为首的帝国主义不抱任何不切实际的幻想，但是我们仍然衷心地希望通过四国首脑会议，在揭露美国战争政策和促进世界和平方面，作出有益的贡献。
