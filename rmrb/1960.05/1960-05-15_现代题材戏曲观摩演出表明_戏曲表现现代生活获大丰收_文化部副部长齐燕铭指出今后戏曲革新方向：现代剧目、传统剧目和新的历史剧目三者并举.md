Xinhua News Agency, 13th: In conjunction with the tour performances of local opera troupes in Beijing, the Ministry of Culture recently held a modern theme opera performance. Participating in the performance were ten repertoires, including Henan Opera, Shanghai Opera, Ping Opera, Beijing Opera, Henan Bangzi Opera, and Lu Opera. This performance demonstrated the tremendous achievements in the art of opera's depiction of modern life in the two years since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, marking further development in opera reform.

During the performance, the ten opera troupes participating in the performance, representatives from various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, and opera workers in the capital exchanged creative experiences and discussed various issues regarding opera performances of modern life themes. Famous playwrights and musicians such as Tian Han, Zhang Geng, Ma Shaobo, Yan Yong, and Ma Ke all spoke at the conference. Famous Beijing Opera actors such as Mei Lanfang, as well as famous opera actors from various regions who were in Beijing, such as Yu Zhenfei, Yuan Xuefen, Ma Shizeng, Hong Xiannu, Chen Bohua, and Ding Shi'e, also participated in the observation and discussion. Finally, Vice Minister of Culture Qi Yanming made a summary speech.

After the performance, the Ministry of Culture convened more than 80 people from the capital's opera circles, famous actors from various regions studying or working in Beijing, as well as representatives from various regions and troupe representatives who participated in this performance, to discuss issues related to opera script creation, artistic reform, and music. Zhou Yang, Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke at the meeting.

In his summary speech on the performance, Vice Minister of Culture Qi Yanming pointed out that in order to sing the praises of the Great Leap Forward and recall the history of the revolution, many excellent modern repertoires have been created in the field of opera in the past two years. These repertoires not only powerfully reflected the heroic wisdom and soaring energy of the Chinese people in political and production struggles, and educated and inspired the people with revolutionary spirit and communist ideology, but also greatly advanced the entire opera reform.

Qi Yanming spoke about the future direction of opera reform, saying: In order to further implement the literary and artistic policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new" and to better serve socialism with opera art, future opera work must vigorously develop modern repertoires; actively sort out, adapt, and stage excellent traditional repertoires; and advocate the creation of new historical repertoires from the perspective of historical materialism. These three should be developed simultaneously. Which of the three should be the focus can vary depending on the type of opera, the troupe, and the conditions of the actors, and should not be forced to be uniform. He pointed out that the main obstacle on the current road of opera reform is conservative thinking, but while opposing conservatism, it is also necessary to prevent crudeness. He called on the opera circles to vigorously cultivate new forces who are both red and expert; strengthen opera research work; strive for the assistance of more literature, drama, music, and art workers; establish lofty ambitions; and make socialist opera art make greater contributions to the world's theatrical treasure house.

    戏曲表现现代生活获大丰收
    文化部副部长齐燕铭指出今后戏曲革新方向：现代剧目、传统剧目和新的历史剧目三者并举
    新华社13日讯　结合各地戏曲剧团来京巡回演出，文化部最近举行了现代题材戏曲观摩演出。参加演出的，有豫剧、沪剧、评剧、京剧、曲剧和庐剧等十个剧目。这次观摩演出，显示了自1958年大跃进以来的两年中戏曲艺术表现现代生活方面的巨大成就，标志着戏曲革新有了进一步的发展。
    观摩演出期间，参加演出的十个戏曲团体和各省、市、自治区的观摩代表及首都戏曲工作者，交流了创作经验，讨论了关于戏曲表演现代生活题材的各种问题。著名戏剧家和音乐家田汉、张庚、马少波、晏甬、马可等都在大会上发了言。京剧界著名演员梅兰芳等和正在北京的各地著名戏曲演员俞振飞、袁雪芬、马师曾、红线女、陈伯华、丁是娥等也参加了观摩座谈。最后，由文化部副部长齐燕铭作了总结发言。
    观摩演出结束后，文化部又召集首都戏曲界人士、在京学习或工作的各地著名演员以及参加这次观摩演出的各地观摩代表和剧团代表八十多人，座谈有关戏曲的剧本创作、艺术革新和音乐等方面的问题。中共中央宣传部副部长周扬在会上讲了话。
    文化部副部长齐燕铭在观摩演出总结发言中指出：为了歌颂大跃进、回忆革命史，两年来戏曲方面创作了许多优秀的现代剧目，不仅有力地反映了我国人民在政治斗争和生产斗争中的英勇智慧和冲天干劲，以革命精神和共产主义思想教育和鼓舞了人民，而且把整个戏曲的革新大大向前推进了一步。
    齐燕铭谈到戏曲革新今后的方向时说：为了进一步贯彻“百花齐放、推陈出新”的文艺方针，使戏曲艺术更好地为社会主义服务，今后戏曲工作必须大力发展现代剧目；积极整理、改编和上演优秀的传统剧目；提倡用历史唯物主义观点创作新的历史剧目，三者并举。三者之中应当以什么为重点，可以因剧种、剧团和演员的条件而有所不同，不必强求一律。他指出，在当前戏曲革新的道路上主要的障碍是保守思想，但是在反保守的同时也必须注意防止粗暴。他要求戏曲界大力培养又红又专的新生力量；加强戏曲研究工作，争取更多的文学、戏剧、音乐和艺术工作者的协助，树雄心、立大志，使社会主义的戏曲艺术，对世界戏剧宝库做出更大的贡献。
