    From Eighty-Three to Toddlers – Scattered Notes on the Jiangsu Yancheng Area's "Catch Up with Jiangnan" Movement
    Written by the Collective of Correspondents of Our Newspaper's Yancheng Special District
    Entering the Yancheng Special District, everything you hear and see revolves around the three words "Catch Up with Jiangnan." In the past, they could only paste spring couplets on their doors saying "Apricot blossoms, spring rain, Jiangnan is number one," treating Jiangnan as a blessed land that was beyond reach. Now, people are using their own hands to turn it into reality before their eyes. Whether it's gray-haired old people, innocent and lively children, energetic young people, or intelligent and capable women, everyone harbors a heroic aspiration in their hearts. They say: The Great Wall was built by people, the Grand Canal was dug by people, Jiangnan wasn't naturally good, its conditions were created by people. Break the shackles of thousands of years of superstition, and heroes will surely surpass Jiangnan!

    Zhang Wenfu, an old farmer from Longgang Commune in Yancheng County, told us: Before liberation, he followed his father to Jiangnan to escape famine every year. Seeing a type of small red rice grown in Jiangnan that yielded five or six hundred catties per mu, he wholeheartedly wanted to bring some back home to plant. His father scolded him, "Boy, do you want to die? Bringing Jiangnan rice seeds to our poor place, can we rely on it to yield a harvest? If we don't get a harvest for one season, the landlord will skin you alive. Stop dreaming!" Zhang Wenfu said: Back then, even if we wanted to learn from Jiangnan, how could we? Now, the Party is leading us to "Jump out of Yancheng and catch up with Jiangnan," this is truly a great joy in our hearts.
              "Little Jiangnans" Like Stars in the Sky
    On April 18th, we arrived at Zhenghong Commune in Binhai County, the hometown of martyr Gu Zhenghong of the "May 30th" Movement. It was a day of great joy for the commune – Chen Zonglie, the First Secretary of the Yancheng Prefectural Committee, and more than 1,000 representatives from various communes in Binhai County, held a grand inspection and acceptance meeting here, officially naming the Erdu Brigade of this commune as the first "Grade A Little Jiangnan" in the entire district. Amidst the cheers of the people, a golden plaque with the words "Little Jiangnan" was hung on the colorful archway of "Kuajiang Gate."

    Stepping through "Kuajiang Gate," the flat "Kuajiang Road" stretches straight into the distance. Symmetrically on both sides of the road are two irrigation canals. The farmland on both sides of the canals is like it has been cut with a knife, small plots of fifteen mu each, and twenty small plots making up one large plot, numbered in order, with responsibility signs inserted. The early rice seedling fields are a tender green, and squares of paddy fields have already been plowed for the fourth time. Behind this row of neat farmland are pig farms, cattle sheds, and threshing grounds, and further behind is the residential area. It is clear that everything here has been rearranged by the hands of the people.

    Before the Spring Festival, these four thousand mu of land were like a tattered Bagua robe. When the commune members heard that they were going to create a "Little Jiangnan" here, they were determined to completely renovate everything old and achieve high-standard river network development and square land plots. Zou Village, a small village of thirteen households, was right on the canal line, and thirty-six houses had to be demolished entirely. On this day, Commune Secretary Lu Yi came to Zou Village, and the people surrounded him. This Party Secretary, who grew up in this local area, opened his mouth in a lively tone: "Everyone sees the commune's kiln firing bricks, right? What are we firing bricks for? It's to build new houses for you. Look, the signs for the new residential area have already been put up. We'll build a batch after the summer harvest, and another batch after the autumn harvest. By that time, Little Jiangnan will be all new houses with blue bricks and red tiles, hahaha..." The secretary's cheerful laughter enlivened the atmosphere. His voice was drowned out by the cheers of the crowd. Grandma Zou, who was seventy years old, held the secretary's hand with a smiling face and said, "Let me, the oldest one, be the first to move, to bring good fortune and longevity to our Little Jiangnan."

    In just seven days, people filled in the original one hundred and twenty-nine small ditches and ports, and twenty-one abandoned ponds, newly dug thirty-one standard irrigation canals, and built twenty-eight wide roads along the canals; flattened seven hundred and twenty-five large and small field boundaries, and built two hundred and seven new field boundaries.

    The sweet water from the Subei Irrigation Main Canal flowed into this past saline-alkali land. The gurgling water filled the leveled land, square by square, like countless large square mirrors embedded in the earth, reflecting the blue sky and white clouds clearly. The masses watched the miracle created by their own hands, and couldn't help singing: In the past, going to Jiangnan meant escaping famine; now, creating Jiangnan means completely transforming ourselves; in the future, when the door is opened, Jiangnan will be everywhere; the more we think about it, the happier we become, joy rises from our hearts.

    The Little Jiangnan of Zhenghong Commune is just one of thousands of Little Jiangnans. All levels of Party organizations in the Yancheng area have their own Little Jiangnans. The Prefectural Committee and the County Committees have ten-thousand-mu Little Jiangnan areas, the communes have two hundred and thirty-eight Little Jiangnan brigades, the brigades have four thousand nine hundred and ninety Little Jiangnan production teams, and each production team has about one hundred mu of Little Jiangnan fields. The entire area has a total of more than two million four hundred thousand mu of Little Jiangnan fields, forming a Little Jiangnan base network scattered like stars. The optimistic and proactive attitude of the commune members of Zhenghong Commune in creating Little Jiangnan represents the revolutionary spirit of the four million eight hundred thousand people in the entire area to catch up with Jiangnan. They say: Brick by brick builds a wall, small rivers converge into a big river, creating thousands of Little Jiangnans, we will surely make Yancheng surpass Suzhou and Hangzhou.

    Now, not only are various communes, brigades, and production teams creating Little Jiangnans, but even the students of Caomiao Elementary School in Dagang Commune, Yancheng County, are learning from the standards of Little Jiangnan wheat fields and have created three mu of "Young Pioneer Little Jiangnan fields." Thirty-six children are responsible for different tasks, the older children manage the furrows, topdressing, and pest control, while the younger ones shovel sod and collect manure. One day, the children sent five representatives to see Shi Xuezhong, the Party Secretary of the commune, insisting that he inspect their Little Jiangnan fields. The Party Secretary followed them to the edge of the field and was shocked. The Little Jiangnan fields created by the children were practically no different from those of the adults. He repeatedly praised them, saying, "Good, qualified! Qualified!"
        Overcoming Nature, Allowing Rice Seeds to Sprout Early
    "In April, Jiangnan is full of new green," but April in Yancheng is filled with the chill of early spring. In the past, the paddy field areas here were still a white expanse during the Qingming Festival; this year, the early rice has been generally sown half a month earlier than in previous years. Patches of tender green seedling fields interspersed among the oily black wheat fields appear particularly bright and dazzling.

    In Longgang Commune, eighteen li from Yancheng, we saw a seedling field from afar, with a firewood windbreak surrounding the northwest corner of the field, and two tall chimneys standing there – truly novel! Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be a specially made charcoal stove. Two large iron pots were connected to bamboo tubes running into the horizontal ditches in the seedling field, and the bamboo tubes in the horizontal ditches were connected to long bamboo tubes with many holes, leading to the seedling ditches, some of which were not bamboo tubes, but canvas belts from fire engines. This special equipment for heating with hot water was truly a sight we had never seen before. The seedling bed was surrounded by a foot-high frame, with rolls of straw mats placed at one end. The faint sunlight shone on the seedling bed, and the lush green was refreshing to the eye. In particular, the seedlings in the oil paper nursery area were already four or five inches high. On the cold coast of the Yellow Sea in early spring, this fresh and tender green, full of vitality, filled people's hearts with sunshine and hope.

    However, all of this was also created through the hard work of people fighting against nature.

    According to the old almanac, in Yancheng, soaking seeds during Qingming was considered the work of an impatient person. This year's first spring sowing in the "Catch Up with Jiangnan" movement was a major revolution, with "early" as the key to rice cultivation. Dong Shu, the County Party Secretary, took the lead, personally cultivating early seedlings here.

    Heaven seemed to be intentionally testing people. In the half month after the early rice was sown, the red sun was not seen, clouds and fog filled the sky, there was wind and rain, and even an annoying spring snow. There were only forty-two hours of sunshine in eighteen days. Such harsh climatic conditions were undoubtedly a fatal blow to the seedlings. But with the Secretary taking the lead, and the "three-way combination" of technicians, old farmers, and cadres, no difficulty could show off its power. The people determined to catch up with Jiangnan had long vowed to compete with Heaven.

    One stormy night, everyone gathered in a thatched hut in the fields, surrounding a dimly lit kerosene lamp, planning new actions. The County Party Secretary said: We must not only protect the seeds from freezing to death, but also make them sprout and grow early. Everyone boldly imagined and debated enthusiastically, and decided to raise the ground temperature by heating with hot water. The daring and proactive people did what they said. Technician Lü Suobao rowed a boat overnight to Yancheng to buy iron pots, some people were busy transporting bricks and mud, and started building stoves, and some people were installing hot water pipes in the seedling ditches. After the charcoal stove was built and lit, a stream of warm water flowed from the bamboo tubes into the fields, raising the temperature of the seedling bed from seven degrees to nine and a half degrees. The soaring enthusiasm and wisdom of the people changed the microclimate of the seedling bed and conquered nature.

    After the seedlings sprouted, people became even more conscientious, like raising a three-day-old infant. They busily removed the straw mats before sunrise. Some seedlings were weak, so they immediately applied fertilizer. How to apply fertilizer to seedlings less than an inch tall? They soaked soybean cake in water, filtered out the residue, and sprayed it on the seedling bed with a sprayer. They carefully picked up any fallen leaves on the covered straw mats. They immediately removed any weeds they saw. They carved and polished with care, as if tending to delicate potted plants.

    After more than a month of hard work, the seedlings successfully overcame the difficulties of seven strong winds, three low temperatures, five frosts, and continuous rainy weather, and grew vigorously.

    This was the earliest seedling field cultivated in the entire special district this year. Their successful news immediately caused a sensation throughout the entire special district, and more than 10,000 people came from all directions to visit and learn. Some old farmers gave a thumbs up to everyone they met and said: To catch up with Jiangnan with rice, raising seedlings is the first hurdle, and the Secretary led us to overcome it!
        Mass Fertilizer Accumulation, Muddy Ditches Spread Throughout the Area
    Following the Yanhai Highway west, we arrived at Jianhu County. At a glance, we saw muddy ditches along the rivers and ditches, one after another, the ditch mouths and ditch walls smooth and round, like a string of black and shiny necklaces hung on the rivers and ditches.

    Jianhu County is a water network area, with rivers and canals crisscrossing, and natural conditions similar to those of Jiangnan. When County Party Secretary Cao Xun visited Jiangnan, he found that muddy ditches were a "treasure." After returning, he personally made a demonstration at the commune secretary meeting; then, each cadre in the county made a standard ditch, and in four days, the entire county completed the layout of ditch digging.

    Why are the people of Yancheng so interested in muddy ditches? It can be clearly understood from the article "Summary of Suzhou's Experience" written by Chen Zonglie, Secretary of the Yancheng Prefectural Committee. He said: Some people believe that Jiangnan has more fertilizer, so the yield is high. After seeing Suzhou this time, Suzhou's fertilizer is indeed abundant, but the source of fertilizer is mainly muddy ditch, river mud, rice straw, pig ash, and green manure mixed together, a good load, or two or three poor loads can be equivalent to a load of pig manure. We also have these raw materials, the problem is that Suzhou has actually done it, and we have not done it well. To learn from Jiangnan, to catch up with Jiangnan, we must learn from Suzhou's experience in accumulating fertilizer. After returning from Suzhou, he immediately launched a mass movement to build muddy ditches throughout the entire area. The Prefectural Committee specially printed the specifications of Suzhou's muddy ditches, distributing them to the production teams and farmers' canteens, and organizing the broad masses of commune members to study and discuss them. The secretaries of the Party committees at all levels personally set an example in Little Jiangnan, both demonstrating and training troops. In just two months, like heavenly maidens scattering flowers, three million eight hundred thousand muddy ditches spread across the land of Yancheng. People say: Phoenixes don't land on barren land, high yields come from fertile fields, now phoenixes are landing everywhere, and muddy ditches are everywhere. With muddy ditches, we are not afraid of catching up with Jiangnan.
        Former Course of the Yellow River, Today's Five Industries Prosper
    From the coast of the Yellow Sea to the shores of Dazong Lake, from along the Tongyu Highway to the banks of the Irrigation Main Canal, we not only saw the many moving deeds of the people of Yancheng humbly learning from Jiangnan and boldly catching up with Jiangnan, but we also saw many "large articles" with a communist spirit emerging on this once poor and barren land.

    Look, in Binhai County, the former course of the abandoned Yellow River, which used to be filled with sand, has now been built into a "Hundred-Li Orchard" two li wide and more than one hundred and forty li long. Along the orchard roads, peach, apricot, pear, date, apple, and other trees are lined up one after another. Along the thirty-seven li, there are also seven gardens, the largest of which is the Moon Palace Garden, covering an area of one hundred mu.

    The originally barren land on both sides of the Tongyu Highway has also been given a new look. A section within Dafeng County has eliminated the abandoned pits dug during road construction, and fish ponds of two or three mu each stretch for dozens of li. From Funing to Binhai, a hundred-li mulberry orchard has been built along the road. The dikes of the Subei's famous Irrigation Main Canal and drainage canals, which used to be overgrown with weeds, now have a hundred-li poultry farm basically completed on this long dike. There are already more than 60,000 chickens, geese, and ducks, and a large-scale spring hatching movement is underway. By the end of this year, it will develop into a million-poultry farm.

    The heroic people of Yancheng are using a brush dipped in colorful ink to draw the newest and most beautiful pictures on a blank sheet of paper. People who came to visit from "Paradise" Suzhou, seeing this magnificent scene and the fearless revolutionary spirit of the people of Yancheng, also praised their competition opponents, saying: "The latecomers will surely surpass the former, and you will definitely catch up with and surpass us in less than two or three years."
                          ×　×　×
    In the "Catch Up with Jiangnan" movement, people from all walks of life in the Yancheng Special District compared themselves to the logistics soldiers of the "Crossing the Yangtze River Campaign" and fully devoted themselves to the battle to support "Catch Up with Jiangnan."

    The employees of the commercial departments waded through thousands of waters and crossed ten thousand mountains, reaching as far as Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Fujian, and other places, personally entering deep mountains and forests to cut bamboo and transport timber, preparing "weapons" for agricultural production. The two hundred and seventy factories run by the special district and counties have all been linked to communes and brigades. In the past three months, they have repaired agricultural machinery and tools for farmers for two million five hundred and eighty thousand pieces, and produced nine hundred thousand pieces of agricultural tools and seven hundred and eighty sets of agricultural machinery. Now, in the vast towns and cities, whether it is in front of movie theaters, in store windows, or even on factory machines and hospital medicine cabinets, there are resolutions and big-character posters to support "Catch Up with Jiangnan." People, regardless of profession, gender, age, or young, are all singing their own voices in this magnificent and broad chorus of "Catch Up with Jiangnan."

    A commune member in Jianhu County made an extremely vivid and powerful summary of all this, which is: From eighty-three to toddlers, everyone talks about Jiangnan, and everyone is catching up with Jiangnan.

    上至八十三下至手里搀
    ——江苏盐城地区赶江南散记
    本报盐城专区通讯员集体采写
    进入盐城专区境内，你所听到的，看到的，都离不开“赶江南”这三个字。过去，他们只能在门上贴起“杏花春雨，江南第一”的春联，把江南当作一个可望而不可即的福地。如今，人们却正在用自己的双手把它变成眼前的现实。不论是苍颜白发的老人，天真活泼的孩子，精力充沛的青年，聪明能干的妇女，每个人心里都蕴藏着一个豪迈的志愿，他们说：万里长城是人造，千里运河是人挑，江南不是天生好，条件本是人创造，打碎千年迷信锁，英雄定把江南超！
    盐城县龙岗公社老农张文福告诉我们：解放前，他年年跟着父亲到江南逃荒，看到江南长的一种小红稻，一亩打五、六百斤，满心想带点回家来种，他父亲劈口就骂了他几句：“孩子你不想活命啦，江南的稻种弄到我们的穷地方，能靠得住收吗？一季收不上，地主会连皮都剥了你的，趁早别做这个梦了。”张文福说：那时虽有心学江南，那能如愿呢！如今党领着我们“跳出盐城赶江南”，这真是心窝里的一件大喜事。
              “小江南”星罗棋布
    4月18日，我们来到了“五卅”烈士顾正洪的家乡——滨海县正洪公社。这一天，恰逢公社的大喜日——盐城地委第一书记陈宗烈同志和滨海县各公社的代表一千多人，在这儿举行了一个隆重的检查验收大会，正式命名这个公社的二渡大队是全区第一个“甲级小江南”。在人们欢呼声中，一块写着“小江南”的金字大匾挂上了“夸江门”的彩楼。
    踏进“夸江门”，平坦的“夸江路”笔直地伸向远方，马路两边对称地是两道灌溉支渠，支渠两边的农田像刀切的一般，十五亩一小块，二十小块一大?，挨次编了号，插有责任牌。早稻秧田一片嫩绿，一方方水田已经在耕第四遍。这一排整齐的农田后面是猪场、牛屋和打谷场，再后面是住宅区。看得出来，这里的一切，都是经过人们的双手重新作了安排的。
    春节之前，这里的四千多亩土地，还像是一件褴褛不堪的八卦衣。社员们听说要在这里创造“小江南”，决心要把旧的一切全部翻新，实现高标准河网化，土地方正化。邹庄，这个十三户人家的小庄子，正好在渠道线上，三十六间房子得全部拆掉。这天，公社书记鲁毅同志来到邹庄，人们把他围了起来。这位当地土生土长的党委书记，用快活的声调开了腔：“大家看到公社的窑场在烧砖头吗？烧砖头干什么，就是要替你们盖新房子的。你们看，新住宅区的牌子已经插好了，夏收以后盖一批，秋收以后再盖一批，到那时候，小江南就全换上青砖红瓦的新房子啦，哈哈哈……”。书记开朗的笑声使空气变得活跃起来。他的声音被大伙儿的欢声盖住了，七十岁的邹老奶奶满面含笑地拉着书记的手说：“让我年纪大的第一个搬，给我们小江南添福添寿。”
    短短的七天时间，人们填掉了原有的一百二十九条小沟小港，二十一个废塘，新挖了三十一条上规格的灌溉渠道，沿渠筑起了二十八条宽敞的公路；平掉了大小田界七百二十五条，新建田界二百零七条。
    从苏北灌溉总渠来的甜水流进这一片过去的盐碱薄地。哗哗的流水灌满了平整过的土地，一方方、一块块，像无数面大方镜子嵌满大地，蓝天和白云，清晰地映在上面，群众眼看着自己双手创造出来的这个奇迹，情不自禁地歌唱道：过去上江南，逃荒去讨饭；现在创江南，彻底把身翻；将来门一开，处处是江南；越想越高兴，喜从心上来。
    正洪公社的小江南，只不过是千百个小江南中的一个，盐城全区各级党组织都有自己的小江南，地委和各县县委有万亩小江南片，公社有二百三十八个小江南大队，大队有四千九百九十个小江南生产队，每个生产队有百亩左右小江南田。全区共有二百四十多万亩小江南田，形成了一个星罗棋布的小江南基地网。正洪公社社员们在创造小江南中的乐观积极的情绪，正代表了全区四百八十万人民赶江南的革命气概。他们说：“一块块砖头砌成墙，一条条小河汇大江，创造千万个小江南，定叫盐城赛苏杭。”
    现在，不但各个公社，各个大队，各个生产队在创造小江南，连盐城县大冈公社曹庙小学的学生，也学着小江南麦田的规格，搞了三亩“红领巾小江南田”。三十六个孩子分工负责，大孩子整理墒沟、追肥、治虫，年龄小的铲草皮，拾粪。一天，孩子们派了五个代表去找公社党委书记施学忠，一定要请他去验收他们的小江南田。党委书记跟着他们到田边一看，大吃一惊，孩子们创造的小江南田，简直和大人的没有二样。连声夸赞说：“好，合格！合格！”。
        战胜自然，让稻种提前披青立苗
    “四月江南新绿满”，四月的盐城却充满着早春的寒意。往年，这里的水田地区，到清明时节还是一片白；今年清明，早稻已经比往年提早半个月普遍落谷。一片片嫩绿的小秧田夹在乌油油的麦海中，显得特别鲜亮耀眼。
    在离盐城十八里路的龙岗公社，老远就看到有一块秧田，秧田西北角围着一道柴编的防风障，还有两座高烟囱竖在那儿哩，真新鲜！走近一看，原来是座特制的炭灶。两口大铁锅上两根粗粗的竹筒通到秧田横沟里的竹筒上，横沟里的竹筒上又接有一根根戳了许多洞眼的长长的竹筒，通向一道道秧沟，有的不是竹筒，而是救火车上的帆布带。这种烧热水加温的特种设备，真是头一回看见。秧板四周都搭有尺把高的架子，一条条草廉卷放在一头。淡淡的阳光照在秧板上，绿汪汪一目清新。特别是油纸育秧的一块秧苗已有四、五寸高。在春寒料峭的黄海之滨，这满含生意的鲜嫩的绿色，使人心里充满了阳光，充满了希望。
    然而，这一切，也是人们在与自然斗争中辛勤创造出来的。
    按照老皇历说话，盐城这个地方从来是清明浸种算是急性子的。今年赶江南的第一个春播，来了个大革命，水稻栽培“早”字当头。县委书记董曙同志带头冲锋陷阵，亲自在这里培育早秧。
    天公似乎有意考验人们，早稻落谷后的半个月中，红日不见，云雾漫天，又是风，又是雨，更加上一场恼人的春雪，十八天中日照只有四十二小时，这样恶劣的气候条件，对于小秧来说无疑是致命的打击。但是书记挂了帅，技术员、老农、干部“三结合”，任何困难也逞不了威风，决心赶江南的人们早就发誓欲与天公比高低。
    一个风雨交加的夜晚，大家在田头草屋里，围着忽明忽暗的煤油灯，计划新的行动。县委书记说：我们不仅要保护种子不让冻死，还要叫它提前出苗生长。大家大胆地设想，热烈地争论，决定用通热水加温的办法提高地温。敢想敢做的人们，说干就干。技术员吕锁宝荡起双浆连夜摇船上盐城买铁锅，有些人忙着运砖运泥，动手砌灶，有些人在秧沟里安装热水管。炭灶砌好了，生火加温后，一股股暖流从竹筒中流向田间，秧池温度从七度提高到九点五度。人们的冲天干劲和智慧改变了秧池的小气候，征服了大自然。
    小秧披青立苗后，人们更是兢兢业业，如育三朝婴儿。日出之前忙把草帘掀掉。有些秧苗瘦弱，马上追肥。幼苗不到一寸，怎么追肥呢？他们用豆饼泡成水，滤清渣滓后用喷雾器喷在秧板上。加盖的草帘上落下一点枯叶，用手轻轻拣起。看到一根杂草，随即拔去。精雕细刻，有如侍候娇贵的盆景。
    经过一个多月的辛勤培育，小秧胜利地闯过了七次大风、三次低温、五次霜冻和连绵阴雨的重重难关，茁壮地生长起来了。
    这是全专区今年培育的最早的一块秧田。他们成功的消息，顿时轰动了全专区，有一万多人从四面八方赶去参观学习。有些老农，逢人就竖起大拇指说：水稻赶江南，育秧第一关，书记带着我们闯过关啦！
        全民积肥，草泥塘撒遍全区
    沿着盐湖公路向西，我们又到了建湖县。一眼望去，只见沿河、沿沟，草泥塘一个紧挨一个，塘口、塘壁光滑滑，圆滚滚，像是给河塘挂上了一串乌黑发亮的项链。
    建湖县是个水网地区，河网交错，自然条件和江南相仿。县委书记曹洵在江南参观时，发现草泥塘是个“宝”，回来以后亲自动手在公社书记会上做样子；接着，全县每个干部一人搞了一个标准塘，四天时间，全县就完成了开塘的布局。
    为什么盐城人民对草泥塘这样感兴趣呢？从盐城地委书记陈宗烈同志写的“苏州取经纪要”一文中就可以知道得很清楚。他说：有人认为江南肥料多，所以产量高。这次到苏州一看，苏州的肥料的确多，但肥料来源主要是草塘泥、河泥加稻草、猪灰和绿肥沤在一起，好的一担，差的两三担就可抵一担猪肥。这些原料我们也有，问题是苏州切切实实地干起来了，我们没有好好干。要学江南、要赶江南，就一定要学习苏州积肥的经验。他从苏州回来以后，就立即在全区开展了一个全民性大搞草泥塘的突击运动，地委专门印发了苏州草泥塘的规格图样，一直发到生产队和农民食堂，组织广大社员学习讨论。各级党委的书记们亲自在小江南做样子，一方面示范，一方面练兵。短短两个月时间，就像天女散花一般，三百八十万个草泥塘撒遍盐城地区的大地。人们说：凤凰不落无宝地，高产出在肥田里，如今是遍地落凤凰，处处是肥塘，一个肥塘一个稻草囤子，有了草泥塘，赶江南心不慌。
        昔日黄河故道，今天五业繁荣
    从黄海之滨到大纵湖畔，从通榆公路沿线到灌溉总渠两岸，我们不仅看到盐城人民虚心学江南，大胆赶江南的许多动人事迹，我们还看到这一块昔日又穷又白的土地上，如今出现了许多具有共产主义气派的“大块文章”。
    看吧，在滨海县，过去黄沙弥漫的废黄河故道，如今建成了一个阔二华里、长一百四十多华里的“百里果园”。果园公路两旁，桃、杏、梨、枣、苹果等树，一排紧靠一排。在沿途三十七华里内，还有七个花园，最大的月宫花园，面积百亩。
    通榆公路两侧，原来有大批荒废的土地，现在也换上了新装。大丰县境内的一段，筑路挖下的废坑不见了，鱼塘二亩一个、三亩一个，连绵数十里。从阜宁到滨海，沿路建起了百里桑园。苏北有名的灌溉总渠和排水渠的堤堰，一直是野草丛生的地方，现在这条长堤上，一个百里家禽场已基本建成。现在已有鸡、鹅、鸭六万多只，一个大规模的春孵运动正在进行着。今年年底，这里将发展成为百万只家禽场。
    英雄的盐城人民用饱蘸彩墨的大笔，在一张白纸上画出了最新最美的图画。从“天堂”的苏州来参观的人们，看到这一派气魄宏伟的景象，看到盐城人民大无畏的革命干劲，也赞不绝口地向他们的竞赛对手说：“后来者一定居上，你们用不到两三年，一定可以赶上并且超过我们。”
                          ×　×　×
    在赶江南运动中，盐城专区各行各业的人们把自己比做“渡江战役”的后勤兵，全力投入了支援赶江南的战斗。
    商业部门的职工，涉千水，过万山，远至浙江、江西、福建等地，亲入深山茂林，伐毛竹、运木材，为农业生产备“武装”。专区和县营的二百七十个工厂都已和公社、大队挂了钩，三个月来，就为农民抢修农机、农具二百五十八万件，生产农具九十万件、农机七百八十台。现在，在广大城镇里，无论电影院门口，商店的橱窗，甚至连工厂的机器上，医院的药橱上，到处都是支援赶江南的决心书、大字报。人们不分职业、不分男女老幼，在赶江南这支雄浑而壮阔的大合唱中，都唱出了自己的声音。
    对于这一切，建湖县有个社员作了一个极为生动而有力的概括，这就是：上自八十三、下至手里搀、人人谈江南、个个赶江南。
