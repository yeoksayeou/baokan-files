Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, May 25th: The Communication Battalion of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army Guangzhou Military Region is using the Pinyin alphabet as a tool to promote Mandarin and eliminate illiteracy among soldiers from Guangdong and Guangxi, achieving remarkable results. Using this method, a newly enlisted soldier can generally learn Mandarin and overcome illiteracy in just three to four months.

　　This communication battalion has many soldiers from Guangdong and Guangxi. Their dialects are complex, and most of them could not understand Mandarin when they enlisted. Communication even relied on small notes and translation assistance. This situation affected the smooth progress of work and study. To quickly change this situation, the battalion launched a large-scale campaign to teach Mandarin using the Pinyin alphabet from top to bottom, finding a shortcut to rapidly eliminate illiteracy and promote Mandarin. This communication battalion began using the Pinyin alphabet for literacy and Mandarin promotion in 1958. In the past two years, the battalion headquarters has used the Pinyin alphabet to teach new soldiers Mandarin and literacy for fifty to sixty hours upon enlistment. In teaching, they first created and promoted the "lively tongue" demonstration method (using red paper to cut out various "tongues" according to the shape of the tongue tip's movement in the oral cavity when pronouncing each letter, and attaching them to an oral cavity diagram to show the pronunciation position and method of each letter) based on the characteristics and rules of the dialects of soldiers from various regions, solving the soldiers' pronunciation difficulties. Afterwards, they adopted a multi-faceted approach combining learning and application, literacy, and Mandarin promotion, to further promote the movement of learning Mandarin. When teaching the Pinyin alphabet, they taught initials, simple vowels, compound vowels, and vowels with tones step by step, while also combining military terms and daily life vocabulary as much as possible to spell out Chinese characters.

　　In addition, they fully mobilized the masses, closely integrated with daily life, and vigorously carried out extracurricular teaching and mutual assistance activities, forming a surge of everyone, everywhere, constantly, and in all matters learning Pinyin and speaking Mandarin. They practiced taking Pinyin notes in class and when listening to reports; used Mandarin to ask and answer each other during breaks; played "Pinyin Poker" during games; held "Military Term Relay Races" in sports activities; and took turns reading newspapers or copying news records in Mandarin at night, and so on.

　　Using the Pinyin alphabet to eliminate illiteracy and promote Mandarin has immediate and rapid effects. Newly enlisted soldiers from Guangdong and Guangxi learned Mandarin within three months. Vocational studies for radio operators were shortened from one year to half a year, and the speed of forwarding messages increased fivefold. The time for eliminating illiteracy was also greatly shortened. Seven illiterate people in a certain company eliminated their illiteracy in three months using the Pinyin alphabet. Soldiers said that learning Chinese characters in combination with the Hanyu Pinyin alphabet is truly a breakthrough in one point, resulting in an all-round harvest. After learning the alphabet Pinyin and the four tones, one can recognize a string of characters by flipping through the Pinyin dictionary. After learning Hanyu Pinyin, many soldiers' reading interest has greatly increased. They are scrambling to read phonetic books and newspapers, and their writing and listening skills have also been greatly strengthened. Some soldiers wrote poems praising: Hanyu Pinyin is a treasure, needed by local troops; Illiteracy hats are all removed, Southern and Northern accents are unified; The people of the whole country are united, building our motherland together.

    解放军广州某部人人处处时时事事学拼音字母
    扫除文盲推广普通话双丰收
    新华社广州25日电　中国人民解放军广州部队某部通讯营，利用拼音字母作工具，在广东、广西战士中推广普通话和进行扫盲，取得了显著成绩。用这种办法，一般只要三、四个月的时间，一个新入伍的战士，就能够学会普通话和摆脱文盲状态。
  这个通讯营两广战士很多。他们中方言繁杂，多数人入伍时听不懂普通话，互相交谈甚至要靠小纸条和翻译的帮助。这种状况，对工作、学习的顺利进行都有影响，为了迅速改变这种状况，这个营从上而下，大张旗鼓地开展了用拼音字母教普通话的活动，找到了一条高速度扫盲和推广普通话的捷径。这个通讯营从1958年开始用拼音字母扫盲和推广普通话，近两年来，每个新战士入伍时，营部就要以五十到六十小时用拼音字母给他教普通话和扫盲，在教学中，他们首先根据各地战士方言的特点和规律，创制和推广了“活舌头”示教法（按照各个字母发音时舌尖在口腔中动作的形态，用红纸剪成各种各样的“舌头”安在口腔图上，用来显示各个字母发音的部位和方法），解决战士发音的难点。以后又采取学用结合，扫盲和推广普通话结合等多边结合方法，进一步推动学习普通话的运动。在教拼音字母时，他们一面按步骤教学声母，单韵母、复韵母、带声韵母等，一面又尽可能结合军事术语、日常生活用语拼注汉字。
    此外，他们还充分发动群众，紧密结合日常生活，大力开展课外的教学互助活动，形成一个人人处处时时事事学拼音、讲普通话的热潮。他们上课、听报告时，练习记拼音笔记；课余用普通话互问互答；游戏时玩“拼音扑克”；体育运动中，举行“军语接力赛跑”；晚上，又轮流用普通话读报或抄收记录新闻等等。
    用拼音字母扫盲和推广普通话，立竿见影，收效极快。新入伍的两广战士在三个月内就学会了普通话。无线电兵业务学习由一年缩短为半年，转发话稿速度提高了五倍。扫盲时间也大大缩短。某连七个文盲，用拼音字母扫盲，三个月摘掉了文盲帽子。战士说，结合汉语拼音字母学习汉字，真是一点突破，全面丰收。学会字母拼音和四声，把拼音字典一翻，就能认识一串字。许多战士学了汉语拼音后，阅读兴趣大大提高，争着看注音书报，书写、听记能力也大大加强了，有的战士写诗称赞说：汉语拼音是个宝，地方军队都需要；文盲帽子一齐摘，南腔北调统一了；全国人民心连心，共把祖国建设好。
