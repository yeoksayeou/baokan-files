    In recent times, the construction and installation enterprises across the country, like other industries, have launched an unprecedented and extensive technological innovation and technological revolution movement. Many construction enterprises have basically achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization, and have established a large number of production lines and automatic lines. The backward technological appearance of construction is rapidly changing. The construction enterprises of Andong City, Liaoning Province, are among the more outstanding.
    The example of Andong City proves that the construction industry, like other industries, can achieve mechanization and semi-mechanization at high speed, and can also engage in automation and semi-automation on a large scale. The notion that the construction industry is technologically backward, with poor equipment conditions and high mobility, and that there are no conditions for automation and semi-automation before the realization of factory construction, is completely wrong.
    The objective material and technical conditions of the construction departments in Andong City are similar to those of other medium-sized cities, but they have achieved remarkable success in the technological revolution movement. The reason is that they not only see the objective conditions but also attach great importance to developing the subjective conditions’ active role. This is to implement the Party's General Line under the leadership of the higher Party committee; to adhere to the correct policy of putting politics in command and boldly mobilizing the masses; and in particular, to firmly implement the Party's "walking on two legs" policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods. Mechanization and semi-mechanization are carried out using a combination of indigenous and foreign methods; automation and semi-automation are also carried out using a combination of indigenous and foreign methods. Earnestly implementing this policy is an extremely important subjective condition. The construction industry is one of the industries with the highest proportion of manual labor in our country. In order to complete the basic construction tasks at high speed and ensure the sustained leap forward of the national economy, the construction industry needs to revolutionize its technology at high speed. However, relying solely on foreign methods will not quickly change the backward technological appearance of construction and installation enterprises. Equipping the construction companies in the Ministry of Construction Engineering system with machinery alone requires nearly ten thousand large machines and hundreds of thousands of medium and small machines. If we do not mobilize the masses to use indigenous and foreign methods to manufacture them ourselves, but only rely on professional factories to manufacture foreign machinery, how can we quickly meet this need? With the subjective condition that the vast number of workers are determined to arm themselves with indigenous methods, the objective conditions can be greatly promoted to change in a favorable direction. Haven't many construction machines created with indigenous methods greatly enhanced the role of objective material technology?
    The Ministry of Construction Engineering recently convened a national on-site meeting on technological innovation and technological revolution in the construction industry. The technological innovation and technological revolution movement in the construction industry is entering a new stage of large-scale popularization and improvement. A very important task at this stage is to summarize, consolidate, and promote the results of technological innovation. The construction departments of Andong City are doing this work, and other construction and installation enterprises are also doing this work. Last year, the construction industry created the experience of the "one-dragon" movement in technological innovation. This is to systematically summarize the innovation of individual machines and the innovation of various scattered operating methods, match them into sets according to work types and procedures, promote them in sets, and correspondingly reform construction technology, labor organization, and enterprise management to make them mutually adaptable and comprehensively improved. This is a good way to summarize, consolidate, and promote innovation results. After several months of vigorous development, the technological revolution movement in the construction industry urgently needs to carry out a "one-dragon" movement in a concentrated manner to systematically summarize it and comprehensively promote it.
    The success of inventions and creations is like breaking through a gap in an offensive battle. Immediately afterward, it is necessary to develop in depth and expand the results in a timely manner to achieve a great victory. An important reason why Andong City has achieved relatively rapid mechanization and semi-mechanization in construction is that they can quickly promote the innovative creations of various groups and various construction sites throughout the city. Some major advanced experiences with universal significance, such as automatic lifting platforms that replace scaffolding, should be promoted in a timely and serious manner by construction and installation enterprises in various places. Some experiences in various regions and units that are suitable for their respective characteristics should also be vigorously promoted within a certain range. Some innovative creations, even if they are not perfect for the time being, should also be actively and enthusiastically supported, promoted, and promoted in many ways. Because any new thing can only be improved in the process of experimentation and use. Whether or not advanced experience is seriously supported and promoted is essentially a question of attitude towards new things. As long as the leaders enthusiastically support the innovation and creation of the workers, summarize and improve them in a timely manner, and earnestly promote them, various effective experiences will surely blossom and bear fruit universally, and the technological appearance of the construction industry will surely be changed more rapidly.

    建筑业技术革命的一个榜样
    最近一个时期，全国建筑安装企业和其它行业一样，开展了规模空前壮阔、内容空前丰富的技术革新和技术革命运动。不少建筑企业基本实现了机械化和半机械化，并且建立了大批的生产联动线和自动线，建筑施工中落后的技术面貌正在迅速改变。辽宁省安东市建筑企业，就是其中较出色的一个。
    安东市的事例证明了：建筑业和其他行业一样，完全可以高速度地实现机械化、半机械化；也能大搞自动化、半自动化。那种认为建筑业技术落后、设备条件差、流动性大，在实现工厂化施工以前，没有条件搞自动化、半自动化的说法是完全错误的。
    安东市建筑施工部门的客观物质技术条件和其它中等城市差不多，但是他们在技术革命运动中取得了出色的成就。原因就是他们既看到客观条件，又十分重视发扬主观条件的能动作用。这就是在上级党委领导下，贯彻执行了党的总路线；坚持了政治挂帅、放手发动群众的正确方针；特别是坚定不移地贯彻执行党的土洋结合的“两条腿走路”的方针。闹机械化、半机械化，采取的是土洋结合的办法；闹自动化、半自动化，同样采取的是土洋结合的办法。认真贯彻这个方针是一个极其重要的主观条件。建筑业是我国手工劳动比重最大的行业之一，为了高速度地完成基本建设任务，保证国民经济持续跃进，建筑业需要高速度革新技术。但是，单纯依靠洋办法，就不可能迅速改变建筑安装企业落后的技术面貌。仅是把建筑工程部系统的建筑公司用机械装备起来，就需要近万台大型机械和几十万吨中小型机械。如果不发动群众自己动手用土洋结合的办法去制造，而只是依靠专业工厂制造洋机械，怎么能迅速满足这一需要呢？有了广大职工坚决用土办法武装自己的这个主观条件，就能够极大地促进客观条件向着有利的方面发生变化。许许多多用土办法创造出的建筑机械，不是大大增强了客观的物质技术的作用吗？
    最近建筑工程部召开了全国建筑业技术革新和技术革命的现场会议，建筑业的技术革新和技术革命运动，正进入一个大普及大提高的新阶段。这一阶段的一项十分重要的工作，是总结、巩固和推广技术革新成果。安东市建筑施工部门正在作这项工作，其他建筑安装企业也正在作这项工作。建筑业去年在技术革新中创造了“一条龙”运动的经验。这就是把单项机具的革新和各种零散的操作方法的革新加以系统总结，按工种、工序配搭成套，成套推广，并且相应地改革施工工艺、劳动组织和企业管理，使之互相适应，全面提高。这是总结、巩固和推广革新成果的一种好方式。建筑业的技术革命运动经过最近几个月的蓬勃发展，亟需集中地开展一次“一条龙”运动，加以系统总结，全面推广。
    发明创造的成功，犹如攻坚战中突破了缺口，紧接着就要向纵深发展，及时扩大战果，才能大获全胜。安东市施工机械化、半机械化实现比较快的一个重要原因，就是因为他们能够把各个小组、各个工地的革新创造迅速在全市推广。具有普遍意义的一些重大的先进经验，如代替脚手架的自动升降工作台等，各地建筑安装企业都要及时认真推广；各个地区、各个单位一些适合各自特点的经验，也要在一定范围内大力推广。有的革新创造，即使暂时还不完善，也要积极热情地去扶持它，多方面地促进它和推广它。因为任何新生事物只有在试验和使用过程中，才能完善起来。是不是认真支持和推广先进经验，实质上是一个对待新生事物的态度问题。只要领导人员对职工的革新创造满腔热情地去扶持，及时地加以总结和提高，并且认真地推广，各种行之有效的经验一定会普遍开花结果，建筑业的技术面貌也一定会更加迅速地得到改变。
