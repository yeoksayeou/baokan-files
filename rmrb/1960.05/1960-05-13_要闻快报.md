    Shaanxi Province Vigorously Grasps Late-Stage Wheat Management
    Shaanxi Province has resolutely broken with complacent sentiments such as the "wheat harvest is a foregone conclusion" theory and the "processing is ineffective" theory, concentrating all efforts on vigorously grasping late-stage wheat management. In early May, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued instructions to Party committees at all levels, requiring first secretaries of Party organizations at all levels to immediately abandon trivial matters and go down to the lower levels, to work in the fields, and mobilize more than 80% of cadres from county-level and below to go to production teams to lead the people of the province in continuing to add water, fertilizer, and measures to wheat, striving to increase the per-mu yield by 20% compared to last year. Currently, a high tide in the late-stage wheat management movement, centered on irrigation, fertilization, eliminating the three categories of fields (inferior, average, and good), and preventing insects, rust, and lodging, has been universally formed throughout the province.

    Fujian Manufactures Bamboo Weaving Machine
    After realizing the mechanization of sawing bamboo, breaking bamboo, and splitting bamboo, workers at the Cangshan Bamboo Ware Factory in Fuzhou have created 84 indigenously-made weaving machines combining local and foreign methods, such as electric thermos bottle mesh shell machines and mesh basket machines, and have begun to realize weaving mechanization. This weaving machine is both lightweight and dexterous. With the flick of a switch, thin bamboo strips are woven around the main bamboo of the basket, creating hexagonal-eyed, herringbone-shaped and other patterns. It can produce 100 bamboo baskets a day, increasing work efficiency by 13 times compared to manual weaving.
