Comprehensive report from our newspaper: Newspapers from socialist countries have successively published editorials and commentaries, welcoming Khrushchev's report at the session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.

Albanian "Voice of the People" says:
	American Aircraft's Intrusion into the Soviet Union is Part of a Plan to Revive the Cold War
	Albania's "Voice of the People" and "Unity" respectively published editorials on the 7th regarding the session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and Khrushchev's report. Both newspapers praised the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy expounded by Khrushchev at the conference, and exposed the West's conspiracy to continue poisoning the international situation.
	The "Voice of the People" editorial said that before the upcoming summit conference, the position and activities of certain ruling groups in the West, especially the United States, showed that they were not working to achieve beneficial results from the Paris talks. The position and speeches recently displayed by major American politicians such as Herter, Nixon, Dillon, and other figures praised by US President Eisenhower, as well as the dangerous activities carried out on peace issues, all illustrate this point.
	The editorial said that the intrusion of American aircraft into Soviet airspace is part of a plan to poison the international atmosphere and revive the "Cold War." The newspaper pointed out that this policy is doomed to failure.

Bulgarian "Workers' Cause" says:
	Western Aggressive Bloc Tries Its Best to Hinder the Rational Resolution of International Problems
	A commentary published in the Bulgarian "Workers' Cause" on the 6th emphasized that the Western aggressive bloc is doing everything possible to complicate the international situation, hinder the rational resolution of mature international problems, and repeat the dangerous path of the "Cold War." The commentary said that those who implement this policy should deeply consider the warning raised by Khrushchev at the session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.

Vietnamese "People's Daily" says:
	Imperialist Countries are Still Continuing to Prepare for War
	A commentary published in the Vietnamese "People's Daily" on the 8th said that the Soviet Union's foreign policy, starting from the interests of the Soviet people, completely conforms to the interests of defending the cause of world peace.
	The commentary said that the interests of the Soviet people and the people of the world require comprehensive and thorough disarmament, the immediate conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, and on this basis, the transformation of West Berlin into a free city.
	The commentary pointed out that facing the strength of the Soviet Union and the socialist camp, under the pressure of the struggle of the people of the world, the bellicose forces of the imperialist countries have to flaunt "peace" and "consultation," but in every corner of the world they can tread, they are still continuing to prepare for war. In particular, many famous figures in the American ruling groups are constantly spreading malicious arguments in an attempt to arouse fear among the people of various countries and lose confidence in peace. Referring to the recent incidents in which American aircraft intruded into Soviet airspace twice, the commentary pointed out that this was a provocative act against the Soviet Union. The commentary pointed out that the Soviet Union has invincible strength, and the Soviet Union will never yield to any threat from the imperialist warmongers.

Korean "Rodong Sinmun" says:
	The Aggressive Nature of US Imperialism is Thoroughly Exposed
	The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published a commentary on the 9th regarding the intrusion of American aircraft into Soviet airspace, saying that the Korean people warmly support the deadly blow given by the Soviet government to the adventurous actions of the US imperialist aggressors.
	The commentary condemned the United States for carrying out this aggressive action against the Soviet Union before the summit conference of great powers. The commentary pointed out that this incident thoroughly exposed the insidious aggressive nature of the US imperialists and their shamelessness and unparalleled cunning before the people of the whole world.
	The commentary said: "Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union Khrushchev's explanation of this incident at the session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union fully demonstrates that US imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of peace and the irreconcilable enemy of the people of the world." The commentary said that facts have proved that the US imperialists are a group of the most hideous dregs of humanity in the world, "whose profession is to carry out aggression against other countries and prepare for war."
	The commentary pointed out: "If the US imperialist aggressors dare to carry out any provocation against the Soviet Union and other socialist camp countries in the future, they will inevitably suffer the same fatal blow."

Polish "People's Tribune" says:
	The West is Intensifying Actions to Undermine the Possibility of Reaching an Agreement between East and West
	The Polish "People's Tribune" said in a commentary on the 7th that Khrushchev made a valuable analysis of the international situation and the fundamental issues of the present time on the eve of the upcoming summit conference. It is very regrettable that the West has strengthened actions aimed at undermining the possibility of reaching an agreement between East and West.
	The commentary pointed out that Khrushchev resolutely took active action against the Cold War group, and warned them against their attempts to poison the international atmosphere, and against the policies of their three Western countries, especially the US government's attempt to exert pressure.

Czechoslovak "Red Right Newspaper" says:
	It is Necessary to Conclude a Peace Treaty with Germany to Stop a New World War
	The Czechoslovak "Red Right Newspaper" published a commentary saying that in order to prevent the reappearance of Hitlerites from launching a war, it is necessary to eliminate the vestiges of World War II, and first of all to conclude a peace treaty with Germany.

	"Neues Deutschland," "Berliner Zeitung," and the Hungarian Budapest "Evening News" also exposed and condemned the provocative act of American aircraft intruding into Soviet airspace.

    兄弟国家报纸支持苏联维护和平的严正立场
    社会主义阵营坚决反击美国战争挑衅
    本报综合报道　社会主义国家的报纸纷纷发表社论和评论，欢迎赫鲁晓夫在苏联最高苏维埃会议上的报告。
    阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”说
    美机侵犯苏联是复活冷战计划的一部分
    阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”和“团结报”7日分别就苏联最高苏维埃会议和赫鲁晓夫的报告发表了社论。这两家报纸都赞颂了赫鲁晓夫在大会上所阐述的苏联的和平外交政策和揭露西方继续在毒化国际局势的阴谋。
    “人民之声报”社论说，在即将召开的最高级会议前夕，西方某些统治集团，首先是美国所持的立场和进行的活动，都表明了它们不是在使巴黎会谈达到有益的效果。美国主要的政治活动家们像赫脱、尼克松、狄龙等美国总统艾森豪威尔所赞扬的人物，最近表现出的立场和演说以及对和平问题所进行的危险活动都说明了这一点。
    社论说，美国飞机侵犯苏联领空是毒化国际气氛与复活“冷战”计划的一部分。报纸指出，这种政策是注定要失败的。
    保加利亚“工人事业报”说
    西方侵略集团竭力阻碍合理解决国际问题
    保加利亚“工人事业报”6日发表的评论中强调指出，西方侵略集团在尽一切可能，使国际局势复杂化，阻碍已经成熟的国际问题的合理解决，重复“冷战”的危险道路。评论说，实行这种政策的人应当深思赫鲁晓夫在苏联最高苏维埃会议上所提出的警告。

    帝国主义国家仍在继续准备战争

    评论说，苏联人民和世界人民的利益，要求全面彻底裁军，立即缔结对德和约，并在这个基础上，把西柏林变成一个自由城市。
    评论指出，面对着苏联和社会主义阵营的力量，在世界人民斗争的压力下，帝国主义国家的好战势力不得不标榜“和平”和“协商”，但是，在它们可以踏上的世界各个角落，它们仍在继续准备着战争。特别是美国统治集团的许多有名人物不断地散播恶毒的论调，以期引起各国人民的恐惧心理和失去对和平的信心。评论在谈到最近美国飞机曾经两次侵犯苏联领空的事件时指出，这是对苏联的挑衅行为。评论指出，苏联具有无敌的力量，苏联绝不会向帝国主义好战分子的任何威胁让步。
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”说
    美帝国主义的侵略本质彻底暴露
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”9日就美国飞机侵犯苏联领空发表评论说，朝鲜人民热烈支持苏联政府对美帝国主义侵略者这次冒险行动所给予的致命打击。
    评论谴责美国在大国首脑会议以前所进行的这种对苏联的侵略行动。评论指出，这个事件在全世界人民面前彻底暴露了美帝国主义者的阴险的侵略本质和它的厚颜无耻和无比狡猾。
    评论说：“苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在苏联最高苏维埃会议上对这一事件的阐述充分说明美帝国主义是全世界人民不共戴天的、和平的最凶恶的敌人。”评论说，事实证明，美帝国主义者是世界上最丑恶的人类渣滓的集团，“它们的职业就是对别国进行侵略和准备战争。”
    评论指出：“如果美帝国主义侵略者今后胆敢对苏联和其他社会主义阵营国家进行任何规模的挑衅，也免不了将受到同样的致命打击。”
    波兰“人民论坛报”说
    西方加紧破坏东西方达成协议的可能性
    波兰“人民论坛报”在7日的一篇评论中说，赫鲁晓夫在即将召开的最高级会议前夕对国际局势和当前根本问题作了有价值的分析。十分遗憾的是：西方加强了目的在于破坏东西方达成协议可能性的行动。
    评论指出，赫鲁晓夫坚决地对冷战集团采取积极行动，对他们毒化国际气氛的企图，对他们的三个西方国家的政策，特别是美国政府企图施加压力的政策提出了警告。
    捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”说
    必须缔结对德和约制止新的世界战争
    捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”发表评论说，要使重新出现的希特勒分子不至于发动起战争，就必须消除第二次世界大战的遗迹，首先要缔结对德和约。
