“Angel of Peace” Descends to Earth
	Hua Junwu (Painter), Chi Beiou (Poet)

	Originally war mongers, draped in beautiful cloaks,
	With smiles plastered on their faces, posing as "Angels of Peace,"
	Flying east and flying west.
	Here they talk about "peace," there they discuss "friendship,"
	Distributing sugar-coated bullets, playing deceptive tricks,
	Performing them time and time again.
	Mouths full of morality and righteousness, bellies full of aggressive schemes.
	Ordering the collection of intelligence, preparing for sudden attacks,
	Saying nice things while doing bad deeds.
	Before even entering the main gate, they hit a wall,
	Trying to steal a chicken but losing rice instead.
	Red rockets soaring into the sky, spy planes falling to the ground,
	Cracking their heads and exposing their true nature.

    “和平天使”下凡
    华君武画　池北偶诗本是战争贩子，披上漂亮外衣，脸上装出笑容，扮作“和平天使”，飞到东来飞到西。这里讲讲“和平”，那里说说“友谊”，分赠糖衣炮弹，玩弄骗人把戏，演完一次又一次。满嘴道德仁义，满肚侵略诡计，下令收集情报，准备突然袭击，说尽好话干坏事。未入头门碰壁，偷鸡不着蚀米，红色火箭上天，间谍飞机落地，碰破了头露了底。
