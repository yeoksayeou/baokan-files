Combined reports from our newspaper:

The North Atlantic Group Council held a meeting in Istanbul, Turkey, from May 2nd to 4th. This meeting took place while the Turkish people were launching a struggle against the Menderes dictatorial regime's reliance on the United States and the North Atlantic Group. Mass demonstrations have been continuously occurring in Istanbul in recent days. Therefore, a large number of military police and tanks were deployed around the venue as if facing a formidable enemy. Turkish Prime Minister Menderes, overwhelmed by the demonstrations of the Turkish people, did not attend the meeting.

According to reports, the main topic of this meeting was to discuss the West's strategies for the upcoming East-West summit conference. During the meeting, US President Eisenhower sent a letter to the attending foreign ministers. In the letter, Eisenhower urged the United States' partners not to relax their arms expansion and war preparations because of the East-West negotiations. He emphasized that "there is no reason to expect any rapid or remarkable results (from the summit conference)."

At the meeting, US Secretary of State Herter also emphasized that "the United States is conducting a large-scale study of its policies for the next ten years." He requested that the North Atlantic Group "allies" devote all their resources to the task that the United States is planning. These remarks by the US President and Secretary of State greatly strengthened the "Cold War" color of this meeting.

The communiqué issued after the meeting "expressed full agreement" with the "common attitude determined" by the United States, Britain, and France towards the summit conference. Although the communiqué expressed a "welcome" to the prospect of negotiations with the Soviet Union, it immediately insisted on the Western countries' unreasonable position on the issue of disarmament. The so-called nine-point disarmament plan that British Foreign Secretary Lloyd will present on behalf of the West at the summit conference still emphasizes supervision without actual disarmament measures. The communiqué also reiterated the Western countries' position of obstructing the signing of a German peace treaty and normalizing the situation in West Berlin. In addition, in their speeches at the meeting, the Western countries' foreign ministers, in the name of East-West relations, attempted to use the guise of so-called "non-interference in internal affairs" to blackmail and restrain the Soviet Union's efforts to strive for peace.

    讨论西方对最高级会议的策略
    北大西洋集团理事会开会
    美国总统写信要求成员国不放松扩军备战
    会议公报表示将阻挠解决裁军和德国问题
    本报综合报道　北大西洋集团理事会2日到4日在土耳其伊斯坦布尔举行会议。这个会议举行的时候，土耳其人民展开了反对投靠美国和北大西洋集团的曼德列斯独裁政权的斗争，连日来伊斯坦布尔都不断发生群众示威，因此会场四周如临大敌地布置着大批军警和坦克。土耳其总理曼德列斯由于被土耳其人民的示威弄得焦头烂额，没有出席会议。
    据报道，这次会议主要讨论西方对即将举行的东西方最高级会议的策略。在会议期间，美国总统艾森豪威尔给到会外长们一封信。艾森豪威尔在信中要美国的伙伴们不要因为东西方谈判而放松扩军备战。他强调“没有理由预料（最高级会议）会有任何迅速的或引人注目的结果”。
    在会上，美国国务卿赫脱也强调“美国正在大规模研究在今后十年中的政策。”他要求北大西洋集团“盟国”把它们的全部资源用于美国正在计划的这个任务。美国总统和国务卿的这些言论，大大加强了这次会议的“冷战”色彩。
    会议闭幕后发表的公报“表示完全同意”美英法三国对最高级会议“确定的共同态度”。公报虽然表示“欢迎”同苏联谈判的前景，但紧接着又坚持西方国家在裁军问题上的无理立场，英国外交大臣劳埃德将代表西方在最高级会议上提出的所谓裁军九点计划仍是只强调监督而没有实际裁军措施。公报还重申西方国家阻挠签订对德和约和使西柏林局势正常化的立场。此外，西方国家外长们在会上在发言中还在东西方关系名义下，企图以所谓“不干涉他国内政”的幌子来讹诈和束缚苏联为争取和平所作的努力。
