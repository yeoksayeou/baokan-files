    Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 8th - A joint communiqué between the Soviet Union and Cuba regarding the resumption of diplomatic relations was released here.

    In the communiqué, the two governments declared that they have restored diplomatic relations at the ambassadorial level between the two countries.

    The communiqué stated that the two governments noted that the Soviet government's action in recognizing the revolutionary government of the Republic of Cuba in January 1959 effectively restored this relationship. The subsequent visit of Soviet First Deputy Premier of the Council of Ministers, Mikoyan, to Cuba was further proof of this.

    As a result of this visit, on February 13, 1960, the two sides signed a trade and payments agreement and an agreement to provide credit, which meant that normal trade relations between the two countries were restored from that time on.

    Furthermore, Soviet Ambassador to Mexico, Vladimir Bazikin, arrived in Havana this afternoon in order to exchange the instruments of ratification of the trade agreement signed by the two countries during Mikoyan's visit to Cuba.
