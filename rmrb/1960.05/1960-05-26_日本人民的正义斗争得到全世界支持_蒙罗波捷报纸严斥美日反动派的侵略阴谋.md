Xinhua News Agency, May 25th – Newspapers in Mongolia, Romania, Poland, and Czechoslovakia have published commentaries resolutely condemning the Kishi Nobusuke group for forcing the Diet to pass the US-Japan military alliance treaty, and warmly supporting the just struggle of the Japanese people.

	The Mongolian "Unen" published a commentary on the 25th stating that the just struggle of the Japanese people will surely be victorious, and US imperialism must get out of Japan. The commentary said that the Kishi Nobusuke group, representing Japanese militarists and fostered by a small handful of reactionary groups in the United States, forcing the Diet to pass the US-Japan military alliance treaty shows that the Kishi Nobusuke reactionary group is a faithful servant of US imperialism.

	The commentary pointed out that the flames of struggle of the Japanese people have become even more turbulent. All upright people in the world fully support the just struggle of the Japanese people and believe that their struggle for independence, peace, democracy, and neutrality will surely be victorious. The Mongolian people stand firmly on the side of the just Japanese working people.

	The Romanian "Apărătorul Patriei" published an article on the 25th saying that a few days after the US aggressive bloc undermined the four-power government summit, the reactionary forces in Japan hastily forced the Diet to pass the US-Japan military alliance treaty, which is another new step by the imperialist aggressive bloc against peace and the easing of the situation. This is primarily against the Soviet Union and other socialist countries in the Far East. The article also pointed out that the struggle of the Japanese people against the illegal passage of the US-Japan military alliance treaty by the Kishi Nobusuke group is unfolding in a magnificent way. In this struggle, the Japanese people have received the sympathy and support of people all over the world.

	The Polish "Tribuna Ludu" published an article on the 25th pointing out that the US military bloc has designated Japan to play the role of West Germany in the Far East, while Kishi Nobusuke is playing the role of Adenauer in the Far East. The Japanese people have not passively treated the anti-peace policy of the Kishi Nobusuke group, but have actively launched an increasingly large-scale struggle against this policy.

	The Czechoslovakian "Rudé Právo" published a commentary on the 24th stating that the signing of the US-Japan military alliance treaty exposed the true colors of the Japanese reactionaries and their ambition to militarize Japan, disregarding the interests of the country and the world.

	The commentary said that the Kishi Nobusuke group, disregarding the wishes of the Japanese people, plotted a deceptive and violent conspiracy to have the US-Japan military alliance treaty approved in the Diet under unprecedented circumstances. The commentary also pointed out that the United States has vast military bases in Japan, and the US ruling group is responsible for the tension in the international situation.
