When U.S. imperialism and its faithful lackey – the reactionary traitorous Kishi Nobusuke clique – colluded and forcibly passed the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty through the Japanese Diet, the Japanese people roared. Millions of people have waged one struggle after another against the reactionary factions of the United States and Japan. The scale is becoming wider and wider, and the anger is becoming more and more intense. This fully reflects the Japanese people's determination and confidence in resolutely opposing the enslavement of U.S. imperialism and demanding independence, democracy, peace and neutrality. We Chinese industrialists and businessmen, like all Chinese people, express our deep sympathy and respect for the Japanese people's strong and unyielding will and actions in this struggle!

The signing of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty nakedly exposes that U.S. imperialism, in the face of opposition from people all over the world, is creating tense situations and instigating new wars everywhere; it exposes that the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke reactionary clique and militarists still want to repeat the old dream of the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" and push the Japanese people into the abyss of war. Under the manipulation and instigation of U.S. imperialism, Kishi Nobusuke recently colluded with Adenauer and openly carried out activities to restore the German-Japanese axis of aggression, preparing to turn West Germany and Japan back into hotbeds of war. These perverse and sinful actions of the U.S. and Japanese reactionary factions once again prove that they are determined to be reactionary to the end, openly hostile to the Japanese people, hostile to the Chinese people, and hostile to the people of Asia and the world. This is something that we Chinese people, the people of Asia, and all peace-loving people of the world can never tolerate.

We Chinese people have always loved peace and opposed wars of aggression. We must unite with the Japanese people, unite with the people of Asia and all peace-loving people of the world, and thoroughly crush the U.S. imperialist conspiracy to launch wars of aggression and dominate the world, to shatter the Kishi Nobusuke reactionary clique's dream of reviving Japanese militarism and preparing to make a comeback, to oppose aggression, and to defend peace in the Far East and the world, and wage a resolute struggle!

Resolutely support the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle!
The Chinese people, the Japanese people, the Asian people, and all peace-loving people of the world, unite!
Oppose the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty!
Oppose the revival of Japanese militarism!
Down with the reactionary factions of the United States and Japan!

    向美日反动派作坚决的斗争
    中华全国工商业联合会主任委员陈叔通的讲话
    当美帝国主义和它的忠实走狗——岸信介反动卖国集团狼狈为奸，签订并强使日本国会通过日美军事同盟条约的时候，日本人民怒吼了。千百万人对美日反动派进行了一次又一次的斗争。规模越来越广泛了，怒火越来越猛烈了。这充分反映了日本人民坚决反对美帝国主义的奴役，要求独立、民主、和平中立的信心和决心。我们中国工商业者和全中国人民一样，对于日本人民这种坚强不屈的斗争意志和行动，表示深切的同情和敬意！
    日美军事同盟条约的签订，赤裸裸地暴露了美帝国主义在全世界人民反对之下，到处制造紧张局势，策动新的战争；暴露了日本岸信介反动集团和军国主义分子，还想重演“大东亚共荣圈”的旧梦，把日本人民推向战争灾难的深渊。岸信介在美帝国主义操纵指使之下，最近还和阿登纳相勾结，公然进行恢复德日侵略轴心的活动，准备把西德和日本重新变成战争的策源地。美日反动派这些倒行逆施的罪恶行动，又一次证明他们决心反动到底，公开与日本人民为敌，与中国人民为敌，与亚洲和全世界人民为敌。这是我们中国人民、亚洲人民以及全世界爱好和平人民所决不能容忍的。
    我们中国人民从来都是爱好和平、反对侵略战争的，我们一定要和日本人民团结在一起，和亚洲人民以及全世界爱好和平人民团结在一起，为彻底粉碎美帝国主义发动侵略战争、独霸世界的阴谋，为击破岸信介反动集团复活日本军国主义、准备卷土重来的迷梦，为反对侵略，为保卫远东和世界和平，作坚决斗争！
    坚决支持日本人民的爱国正义斗争！
    中国人民、日本人民、亚洲人民和全世界爱好和平的人民团结起来！
    反对日美军事同盟条约！
    反对复活日本军国主义！
    打倒美日反动派！
