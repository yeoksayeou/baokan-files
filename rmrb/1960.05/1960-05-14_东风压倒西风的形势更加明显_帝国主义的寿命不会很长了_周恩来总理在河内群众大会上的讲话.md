Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 13th. Premier Zhou's full speech at the Hanoi mass rally this morning: Respected Chairman Ho Chi Minh, dear Comrade Prime Minister Pham Van Dong, dear Comrade Tran Duy Hung, Chairman of the Hanoi Municipal Administrative Committee, dear comrades and friends:

We are very happy to be able to meet again with representatives from all walks of life in the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, after a separation of three and a half years. What is particularly gratifying is that our meeting this time comes at a time when the Vietnamese people are experiencing one joyous event after another. Not long ago, you celebrated the glorious 30th anniversary of the founding of the Vietnam Workers' Party and victoriously conducted the election of deputies to the Second National Assembly. Soon after, you will celebrate the 70th birthday of Chairman Ho Chi Minh, the leader deeply loved by the Vietnamese people, and the 15th anniversary of the founding of the great Democratic Republic of Vietnam. At such a moment, we feel very honored to share your joy. On behalf of the Chinese people, I would like to extend the warmest congratulations to all the Vietnamese people.

Three and a half years is a very short period of time, but during this period, what brilliant achievements have the Vietnamese people made! What tremendous changes have taken place in the face of your country! You have rapidly healed the wounds of war, and since 1958 you have entered a new period of socialist revolution and socialist construction, victoriously implementing the three-year plan for developing, transforming the national economy and developing cultural undertakings. The socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce is about to be basically completed. The output value of industry and handicrafts has been growing at a leaping rate of nearly 30% per year on average, and state-owned industrial enterprises have sprung up like mushrooms after a rain. Industrial products that have never been manufactured in the past are now being produced in batches. In agriculture, thanks to a series of production increase measures, especially due to the construction of water conservancy projects, output has increased significantly. 1959 was a year in which northern Vietnam suffered from particularly severe natural disasters, but the Vietnamese people, who began to organize, transformed it into a year of unprecedented bumper harvest in history, with the total output of rice increasing by more than double the highest pre-war annual output, reaching 5,194,000 tons. Now, whether calculated per hectare or per capita, the rice production of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has taken the first place in Southeast Asia. The hardworking, intelligent and thrifty Vietnamese people have every reason to be proud of such great achievements. The Chinese people and the people of all countries in the entire socialist camp cheer for your great achievements.

In contrast to the thriving situation in northern Vietnam, southern Vietnam is a scene of misery. Southern Vietnam, known as the "granary," had a pre-war rice production that exceeded the output of northern Vietnam by about double, but in 1959 it was almost only equal to half of the output of northern Vietnam. The light industry in southern Vietnam, under the attack of foreign goods, especially the so-called "aid" materials from the United States, has also fallen into a predicament of production shrinking. The bankruptcy of the countryside and the decline of industry have caused serious unemployment and famine, and the broad masses of people in southern Vietnam are living in dire straits. The sharp contrast shows how great the creativity of the people who control their own destiny in northern Vietnam is, illustrates the correct leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party headed by Chairman Ho Chi Minh, and illustrates the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. As time goes by, more and more South Vietnamese people will draw the conclusions they should draw in the struggle for national independence, democratic freedom. This will have a profound impact on promoting the peaceful reunification of your motherland.

In the past three years, the Chinese people have also achieved relatively significant achievements in the cause socialist revolution and socialist construction.

Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, relying on the three magic weapons of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, the Chinese people have already completed the targets of the main products in the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule in 1959. At present, in order to fulfill and overfulfill the national economic plan for 1960, our people are launching a vigorous campaign to increase production and practice economy centered on technological innovation and technological revolution. While consolidating and developing the rural people's communes, we have also begun to establish people's communes in cities. The Chinese people are determined to catch up with and surpass the United Kingdom in the output of major industrial products in less than ten years and basically establish a complete economic system; determined to realize the National Agricultural Development Program for 1956-1967 ahead of schedule and basically realize agricultural mechanization, water conservancy, and a considerable degree of electrification; determined to continue to carry out cultural revolution, basically popularize primary and secondary school education and spare-time education, and complete the Scientific and Technological Development Plan for 1956-1967 ahead of schedule. We firmly believe that as long as we continue to hold high the three red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, we will be able to build our country into a socialist country with highly developed modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture relatively quickly.

In the past three and a half years, not only has the domestic situation in our two countries gotten better day by day, but the world situation has also become more and more favorable to socialism and world peace. The socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is stronger and more united. The construction speed of socialist countries has generally accelerated. The peace efforts of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries are increasingly gaining popularity. At the same time, the national democratic movement in Asia, Africa, and Latin America and the struggle of the people in capitalist countries for democracy and socialism have also made new and greater developments. The internal contradictions of the imperialist camp continue to expand, and their situation is becoming increasingly difficult and isolated. The situation of the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind, as pointed out by Chairman Mao Zedong more than two years ago, is becoming more and more obvious day by day. The life of imperialism will not be too long.

In the situation where the balance of power in the world is becoming increasingly unfavorable to imperialism and war forces, imperialists, especially American imperialists, in order to promote their war policies and aggression policies, are trying to adopt more cunning and more deceptive tactics. They spread a "peace smokescreen," attempting to create the illusion that imperialism also loves peace, in order to paralyze the people of the world and disintegrate the struggle of the people of various countries for revolution and world peace. At the same time, they continue to obstruct the solution of major international issues, continue to expand armaments and prepare for war, expand overseas military bases, strengthen aggressive military blocs, and are impatiently supporting the militaristic forces of West Germany and Japan, making them the hotbeds of new wars. Recently, on the eve of the upcoming East-West summit conference, American imperialism has repeatedly sent planes to violate Soviet airspace and carried out blatant military provocations against the Soviet Union, deliberately creating international tensions. This thoroughly exposed the ferocious nature of American imperialism. We firmly support the resolute attitude taken by the Soviet government in dealing with this serious provocation incident. Provocation against the Soviet Union is a provocation against the entire socialist camp; we firmly demand that the United States stop this provocative behavior against the entire socialist camp and all peace-loving people in the world. No matter how much it is disguised, the nature of imperialism cannot be changed. The people of China and Vietnam understand this very clearly based on their own experience. It is American imperialism that still occupies China's territory of Taiwan. It is also American imperialism that constantly sends military personnel into South Vietnam and tries its best to obstruct the peaceful reunification of Vietnam. The Chinese people must liberate Taiwan, and at the same time resolutely support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people for the peaceful reunification of their motherland. Puppet regimes that rely on the breath of imperialism and violate the will of their own people cannot last long, even under the support of the bayonets of foreign masters. The shameful end of Syngman Rhee in South Korea is a vivid example. Vietnam is a unified country from Lang Son to Ca Mau. The Vietnamese people are a heroic people with a long tradition of anti-imperialist struggle. We believe that with the strong support of the powerful socialist camp and all peace-loving people and countries, the just cause of the Vietnamese people to strive for the peaceful reunification of their motherland will surely achieve final victory.

Our two countries, China and Vietnam, are neighbors as closely related as lips and teeth, and the people of our two countries are brothers who share weal and woe. We are both socialist countries, and our unity has been formed and developed under the great banner of Marxism-Leninism, and is therefore unbreakable. The people of our two countries have long sympathized with and supported each other in the struggle for national liberation and against imperialism, and have forged a fighting friendship. After our two countries embarked on the common socialist road, we united in the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union. Our two countries support each other, assist each other, cooperate with each other, and coordinate with each other to promote the common upsurge of the socialist construction of the two countries. Our two countries are engaged in a common struggle in international affairs, opposing imperialism, supporting the revolutionary movement and national liberation movement of the people of all countries, and striving for world peace. Our construction achievements are great. The overall international situation is favorable to us. Our future is infinitely bright. Let us unite more closely, work hard, persevere in struggle, and no matter how imperialism struggles, the noble cause of socialism and world peace must ultimately win victory.

Long live the Democratic Republic of Vietnam!
Long live the unbreakable brotherly friendship between the people of China and Vietnam!
Long live the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!
Long live the Vietnam Workers' Party!
Long live Chairman Ho Chi Minh!

    东风压倒西风的形势更加明显
    帝国主义的寿命不会很长了
    周恩来总理在河内群众大会上的讲话
    新华社河内13日电　周总理今天早晨在河内群众大会上的讲话全文：敬爱的胡志明主席，亲爱的范文同总理同志，亲爱的河内市行政委员会主席陈维兴同志，亲爱的同志们，朋友们：
    我们非常高兴在分别了三年半以后，能够再一次同越南民主共和国首都各界人民的代表们会面。令人特别高兴的是，我们这次会面是在越南人民的几件大喜事一个接着一个到来的时候。不久以前，你们庆祝过光荣的越南劳动党建党三十周年，胜利地进行了第二届国会代表的选举。不久以后，你们将要庆祝越南人民衷心爱戴的领袖胡志明主席的七十大寿和伟大的越南民主共和国建国十五周年。在这样的时刻，我们能够分享你们的欢乐，感到十分荣幸。我谨代表中国人民向全体越南人民表示最热烈的祝贺。
    三年半是一个很短暂的时间，但是，在这个期间，越南人民取得了多么辉煌的成就！你们国家的面貌发生了多么巨大的变化！你们迅速地医治了战争的创伤，从1958年起你们跨进了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的新时期，胜利地执行着关于发展、改造国民经济和发展文化事业的三年计划。农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，即将基本完成。工业和手工业的产值每年平均以将近30％的速度飞跃地增长，国营工业企业像雨后春笋一样地兴建起来，过去从来没有制造过的工业产品现在成批地生产出来了。在农业方面，由于一系列的增产措施，特别是由于兴修水利，产量有了显著的增长。1959年是越南北方遭受特大自然灾害的一年，但是，开始组织起来的越南人民把它变成为历史上空前大丰收的一年，稻谷的总产量比战前最高的年产量增加一倍以上，达到五百十九万四千吨。现在，不论是按公顷或者是按人口平均计算，越南民主共和国的稻谷产量都已经在东南亚跃居第一位。勤劳、智慧和俭朴的越南人民完全有理由对于这样伟大的成绩感到自豪。中国人民和整个社会主义阵营的各国人民都为你们的巨大成就而欢呼。
    同越南北方欣欣向荣的情况相反，越南的南方却是一片悲惨的景象。越南南方素有“谷仓”之称，战前的稻谷产量超过越南北方的产量一倍左右，但是在1959年却几乎只等于越南北方产量的一半。越南南方的轻工业，在外国货特别是美国的所谓“援助”物资的打击下，也陷于生产萎缩的困境。农村破产和工业雕敝造成了严重的失业和饥饿现象，越南南方的广大人民生活在水深火热之中。鲜明的对比说明了在越南北方掌握了自己命运的人民具有何等伟大的创造力，说明了以胡志明主席为首的越南劳动党的正确领导，说明了社会主义制度的无比优越性。随着时间的推移，越来越多的南越人民会在为民族独立、民主自由的斗争中得出应有的结论。这对于促进你们祖国的和平统一将产生深远的影响。
    三年多以来，中国人民在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的事业中也取得了比较显著的成就。
    中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，依靠总路线、大跃进和人民公社三件法宝已经在1959年提前三年完成了第二个五年计划中主要产品的指标。目前为了完成和超额完成1960年的国民经济计划，我国人民正在展开一个轰轰烈烈的以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动。我们在巩固和发展农村人民公社的同时，在城市中也开始建立人民公社。中国人民决心要在不到十年的时间内在主要工业产品的产量方面赶上和超过英国，基本上建立起一个完整的经济体系；决心要提前实现1956—1967年全国农业发展纲要，基本上实现农业机械化、水利化和相当程度的电气化；决心要继续进行文化革命，基本上普及中小学教育和业余教育，提前完成1956—1967年的科学技术发展远景规划。我们坚信，只要我们继续高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗，我们一定能够比较快地把我国建设成为一个具有高度发展的现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义国家。
    三年半以来，不仅我们两国的国内形势一天比一天好，世界形势也越来越有利于社会主义和世界和平。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营更加强大，更加团结。社会主义各国的建设速度普遍加快。苏联和其他社会主义国家的和平努力日益深入人心。同时，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族民主运动和资本主义各国人民争取民主和社会主义的斗争也有了新的更大的发展。帝国主义阵营的内部矛盾继续扩大，它们的处境日见困难和孤立。毛泽东主席两年多以前所指出的东风压倒西风的形势，一天比一天更加明显。帝国主义的寿命不会太久了。
    在世界上的力量对比越来越不利于帝国主义和战争势力的形势下，帝国主义者特别是美帝国主义者，为了推行他们的战争政策和侵略政策，力图采取更加狡猾、更具有欺骗性的策略。他们散布“和平的烟幕”，企图造成帝国主义也爱好和平的假象，以便麻痹世界人民，瓦解各国人民革命和争取世界和平的斗争。与此同时，他们都像过去一样，继续阻挠重大国际问题的解决，继续扩军备战、扩大海外军事基地，加强侵略性的军事集团，并且迫不及待地扶植西德和日本的军国主义势力，使它们成为新战争的策源地。最近，在东西方最高级会议即将举行的前夕，美帝国主义竟一再派出飞机侵犯苏联的领空，对苏联进行露骨的军事挑衅，蓄意制造国际紧张局势。这就彻底暴露了美帝国主义穷凶极恶的真面目。我们坚决支持苏联政府对待这一严重挑衅事件采取的坚决态度。对于苏联的挑衅，就是对于整个社会主义阵营的挑衅；我们坚决要求美国停止这种对整个社会主义阵营和全世界爱好和平人民的挑衅行为。不管怎样粉饰，帝国主义的本性是不可能改变的。对于这一点，中越两国人民根据自己的经验，了解得非常清楚。至今侵占着中国的领土台湾的，正是美帝国主义。不断派遣军事人员进入南越、竭力阻挠越南和平统一的，也正是美帝国主义。中国人民一定要解放台湾，同时也坚决支持越南人民和平统一祖国的正义斗争。仰承帝国主义的鼻息、违反本国人民意志的傀儡政权，即使是在外国主子的刺刀支撑之下，也是维持不了多久的。南朝鲜李承晚的可耻下场，就是一个生动的事例。越南是一个从谅山到金瓯的统一的国家。越南人民是有长期反帝斗争传统的英雄人民。我们相信，在强大的社会主义阵营和一切爱好和平的人民和国家的大力支援下，越南人民争取和平统一祖国的正义事业一定能够获得最后的胜利。
    我们中越两国是唇齿相依的邻居，我们两国人民是休戚与共的兄弟。我们都是社会主义国家，我们的团结是在伟大的马克思列宁主义的旗帜下形成和发展起来的，因而是牢不可破的。我们两国人民早在争取民族解放、反对帝国主义的斗争中，就互相同情、互相支持，结成了战斗的友谊。我们两国走上了共同的社会主义道路以后，又团结在以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭里。我们两国互相支持、互相援助、互相配合、互相协作，以促进两国社会主义建设事业的共同高涨。我们两国在国际事务中进行着共同的斗争，反对帝国主义，支持各国人民的革命运动和民族解放运动，争取世界和平。我们建设的成就是伟大的。总的国际形势对我们是有利的。我们的前途无限光明。让我们更加紧密地团结起来，努力工作，坚持斗争，不管帝国主义怎样挣扎，社会主义和世界和平的崇高事业最后一定要取得胜利。
    越南民主共和国万岁！
    中越两国人民牢不可破的兄弟友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大团结万岁！
    越南劳动党万岁！
    胡志明主席万岁！
