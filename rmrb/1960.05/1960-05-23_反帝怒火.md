    Anti-Imperialist Rage
    The black jail of Sha Bai cannot confine, the iron chains cannot lock, tanks and bayonets cannot suppress, rockets and poison gas cannot intimidate. It is a volcano, about to erupt, it is a raging fire, about to burn, it is a running dog, give it a head-on blow, it is a venomous snake, aim at its vital point and strike hard! Fight for national rights abroad, punish national traitors at home, walk out of factories, walk out of schools, the banner of righteousness flutters in the streets of Seoul, the angry tide surges in Istanbul. At the top of Mount Fuji, flames burst forth, the oasis of stability, is swaying in the wind and rain... From the backyard to the outpost, the anti-imperialist rage burns across the sky! Burns across the sky, burns across the sky, the east wind is strong, the west wind falls, the fire takes advantage of the wind, the wind helps the fire's power, burning half the globe red!

    反帝怒火
    沙白黑牢监，关不住，铁链子，锁不牢，坦克、刺刀压不了，火箭、毒气吓不倒。是火山，就要爆发，是烈火，就要燃烧，是走狗，给它当头一棒，是毒蛇，对准七寸子狠狠敲！外争国权，内惩国贼，走出工厂，走出学校，汉城大街义旗飘飘，伊斯坦布尔怒潮滔滔。富士山顶，烈焰迸射，安定的绿洲，风雨飘摇……从后院，到前哨，反帝怒火漫天烧！漫天烧，漫天烧，东风猛，西风倒，火乘风势，风助火威，把半个地球烧红了！
