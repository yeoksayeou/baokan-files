    Inner Mongolia Pastoral Areas Grow Various Grains and Fodder
    The vast pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia are striving to achieve self-sufficiency in grain and fodder within the next one to two years, and to realize ahead of schedule the requirements of the National Program for Agricultural Development regarding the gradual establishment of fodder bases in pastoral areas. This was determined at the recent Inner Mongolia Pastoral Area Grain and Fodder Base On-Site Conference.
    The planting of grain, fodder, and vegetables in pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia has developed to 1.2 million mu last year and will be expanded to more than 2.7 million mu this year, more than double that of last year. The establishment and rapid development of grain, fodder, and vegetable bases in vast pastoral areas will transform the single-economy pastoral areas into new pastoral areas with thriving livestock, abundant grains, and a combination of agriculture and animal husbandry. This is of great significance to the economic and cultural life of the people in pastoral areas.

Cadres and the masses have gone deep into the fields to find shortcomings, investigate causes, formulate transformation plans, carry out large-scale basic construction such as water, fertilizer, and soil, and organize forces from all aspects to provide strong support, transforming low-yield fields into high-yield fields.
