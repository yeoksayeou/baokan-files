Xinhua News Agency, Paris, May 17th, TASS dispatch: Soviet Premier Khrushchev, on May 16th at the preliminary meeting of the government heads attended by French President de Gaulle, British Prime Minister Macmillan, US President Eisenhower, and Soviet Premier Khrushchev and their entourages, made the following statement:

Statement by Soviet Premier Khrushchev to French President de Gaulle, British Prime Minister Macmillan, and US President Eisenhower, May 16, 1960

President de Gaulle! Prime Minister Macmillan! President Eisenhower!

Allow me to make the following statement to you:

As everyone knows, a recent provocative action against the Soviet Union was carried out by the U.S. Air Force. This action was manifested in the intrusion of a U.S. military reconnaissance plane into the Soviet border on May 1 this year, to carry out espionage missions to collect intelligence about military and industrial targets on Soviet territory. After the aggressive purpose of this aircraft's flight was exposed, the aircraft was shot down by Soviet missile forces. Unfortunately, this is not the only incident of aggressive and espionage actions carried out against the Soviet Union by the U.S. Air Force. The Soviet government naturally had to give a corresponding assessment of this action and point out the perfidious nature of this action, which is inconsistent with the minimum requirements for maintaining normal international relations in peacetime, not to mention that this action grossly violated the task of easing international tensions and creating the necessary conditions for the effective work of the summit meeting. This point has already been discussed in my speech at the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and in a special protest note to the US government.

Initially, the US State Department prevaricated, saying that the intrusion of the American plane into Soviet territory was accidental and did not involve any espionage or sabotage missions. However, after the falsity of this statement was exposed based on irrefutable facts, the US State Department on May 7, and later the US Secretary of State on May 9, declared in the name of the US government that the American plane had intruded into Soviet territory for military espionage purposes according to a plan approved by the US government and the President himself. Two days later, President Eisenhower himself confirmed that the flight of American planes in Soviet airspace was, and would continue to be, a policy relied upon by the United States.

The US government also stated this in a note to the Soviet government on May 12, thus the US government has grossly trampled on universally recognized norms of international law and the lofty principles of the United Nations Charter, which the United States also signed.

The Soviet government and the entire Soviet people were outraged by this statement from the US national leaders, and every honest person in the world who cares about the fate of peace is equally outraged.

Now, when the leaders of the four major powers have come to Paris to attend the meeting, the following question arises: when the US government and the President himself have not only not condemned the provocative actions of the US military aircraft infringing upon Soviet territory, but have even claimed that such actions will continue to be the US's national policy towards the Soviet Union, how can there be fruitful talks and discussions on the issues facing the meeting? When the government of a major power openly states that it is its policy to intrude into the territory of another major power for espionage and sabotage purposes, thereby intensifying international tensions, how can agreements be reached on this or that issue to be resolved, in order to ease international tensions and eliminate suspicion and distrust between countries? Obviously, announcing a policy that can only be pursued under conditions of war between countries is to doom the summit meeting to utter failure in advance.

Of course, we have taken note of this policy announced by the US government and have stated that if US planes intrude into Soviet territory again, we will shoot them down.

The Soviet government reserves the right in all these circumstances to take appropriate countermeasures against those who violate Soviet national sovereignty and engage in such espionage and sabotage activities against the Soviet Union. The Soviet government reiterates that appropriate measures will also be taken against those countries that provide their territory to the United States as military bases, becoming accomplices in aggressive actions against the Soviet Union, up to and including striking these bases.

Here, one cannot help but draw attention to President Eisenhower's statement that he could not attend the summit meeting under the threat of concluding a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic, although his so-called threat was only the Soviet government's declared firm determination to clear away the remnants of the war in Europe, conclude a peace treaty, and thereby bring the situation, especially the situation in West Berlin, into line with the needs of life and with the interests of safeguarding peace and security for the peoples of Europe. How can the Soviet government participate in negotiations when the US government claims that it will continue to violate Soviet borders, that US planes have flown and will continue to fly over Soviet airspace, when it makes this real threat? In this way, the US government is expressing its intention to continue to take unprecedented actions aimed against the sovereignty of the Soviet state, which is a sacred and inviolable principle in international relations.

From all this, it can be concluded that in order for the meeting to be successful, the governments of all participating countries must pursue an open and honest policy and solemnly declare that they will no longer take any actions that undermine national sovereignty. That is to say, if the US government truly intends to cooperate with the governments of other major powers to maintain peace and strengthen trust between countries, then it should: first, condemn the unacceptable provocative actions of the US Air Force against the Soviet Union; second, no longer take such actions against the Soviet Union in the future and pursue such policies. It goes without saying that in this case, the US government cannot but severely punish those criminals who were directly involved in the pre-planned American aircraft intrusion into Soviet territory.

Until the US government does this, the Soviet government does not see the possibility of conducting fruitful negotiations with the US government at the summit meeting. It cannot be among the participants in negotiations that are obviously doomed to failure, one of whom bases perfidy towards the Soviet Union on its policy.

If the Soviet government were to participate in negotiations that are clearly doomed to failure under the current circumstances, it would become an accomplice in deceiving the peoples of all countries, but it does not want to become such an accomplice.

It goes without saying that if the US government declares that it will no longer violate the borders of the Soviet Union with its planes, condemns the provocative actions that have been committed in the past, and punishes the direct perpetrators of these actions, this would ensure that the Soviet Union has equal conditions with other countries, then I, as the head of the Soviet government, am willing to participate in the meeting and do everything possible to make the meeting a success.

The provocative flight of American military aircraft, and mainly the declaration that such provocative flights will be carried out in the future as the US national policy against socialist countries, have created a new situation in international relations.

Of course, we cannot hold a meeting under these circumstances; we cannot hold a meeting because we see from what position people want to deal with us—that is, they wish to deal with us under the threat of aggressive reconnaissance flights. As everyone knows, espionage flights are carried out with reconnaissance purposes aimed at launching a war. Therefore, we reject the conditions created for us by the United States. We cannot participate in any negotiations, and we cannot participate in solving those problems that have even matured, because we see that the United States has no desire to reach an agreement.

The United States is regarded as the leader in Western countries. Therefore, the current meeting will be a waste of time and a deception of public opinion in all countries. I repeat, under the current circumstances, we cannot participate in negotiations.

We are only willing to participate in negotiations on an equal footing, under conditions where both sides have equal possibilities.

We believe it is necessary for the people and public opinion of all countries to correctly understand us. The Soviet Union does not give up efforts to strive for reaching an agreement, and we believe that a wise agreement can be reached, but obviously not now, but at another time.

However, to do this, first the United States must declare that it condemns the policy of provocation—which it calls the policy of "free" flights in our airspace—declare that it abandons this policy, acknowledges that it has committed aggression, and expresses regret for it.

The Soviet government firmly believes that if this US government does not understand, then the next US government will understand, and if the next US government does not understand, then the one after that will understand that there is no other way out besides the peaceful coexistence of the capitalist system and the socialist system, either peaceful coexistence or war, and war will bring great disasters to those who are pursuing aggressive policies.

Therefore, we believe that there must be a period of time to clarify the issues that have arisen, so that those who are responsible for deciding the direction of national policy can analyze what responsibility they should bear for declaring an aggressive course in relations with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. So we believe that there is no better way than to postpone the summit meeting by about six to eight months.

The Soviet side will not relax its efforts to strive for an agreement. I think that public opinion will correctly understand our position, will understand that we are deprived of the possibility of participating in this negotiation.

But we firmly believe that we must coexist peacefully, because losing faith in peaceful coexistence means plunging mankind into war, which means agreeing to the inevitability of war; and as everyone knows, under the current conditions, war will bring disaster to the peoples of all countries.

I would like to say a few words to the American people. I have been to the United States and met with people from all walks of life, and I deeply believe that people from all walks of life in the United States do not want war. Only a small, arrogant group in the Pentagon and the militarists who support this group are the exception, because these people live off the arms race and make huge profits from it, disregarding the interests of the American people and completely disregarding the interests of the peoples of all countries, pursuing an adventurous policy.

We express our gratitude to President de Gaulle for his warm hospitality and for providing the possibility of meeting in the French capital, Paris. We also attach great importance to the efforts made by the British government and Prime Minister Macmillan himself.

It is regrettable that this meeting was sabotaged by the American reactionaries through the provocative flight of American military aircraft in Soviet airspace.

We regret that this meeting did not lead to the results that the peoples of the world expected the meeting to bring.

Those who have announced a robber policy against the Soviet Union should be held responsible for this; they are disgraceful.

As everyone knows, Mr. US President Eisenhower and I agreed to visit each other. I made this visit to the United States last September. We were very satisfied with this visit, very satisfied with the meetings and talks held in the United States, for which I have expressed my gratitude.

The US President was supposed to make a return visit to our country. We originally agreed that he would come to our country on June 10, and we had also prepared to receive the distinguished guest well.

Unfortunately, due to the provocative act of aggression against the Soviet Union, a situation has now been formed in which we have been deprived of the possibility of receiving the President with the kind of warmth that the Soviet people should have when they receive their welcomed guests. Now we cannot express such warm feelings to the US President, because the provocative flight of American military aircraft with reconnaissance purposes has formed conditions that are clearly unfavorable for this visit. The Soviet people do not play tricks, nor do they want to play tricks.

Therefore, we believe that the date of the US President's visit to the Soviet Union must now be postponed, and the date of the visit will be discussed again when the conditions for the visit are ripe. At that time, the Soviet people will show due hospitality to the distinguished guest representing a major power with which we sincerely hope to live in peace and friendship.

I think that Mr. Eisenhower and the American people will correctly understand me.

The Soviet government declares that it, for its part, will continue to do everything possible in the future to promote the easing of international tensions and the resolution of the problems that still separate us today; in this regard, we will follow the interests of strengthening the great cause of peace based on the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems.

Xinhua News Agency, Paris: Today, newspaper reporters asked Khrushchev a question: "What are your views on the statement made by White House Press Secretary Hagerty on behalf of US President Eisenhower that today's four-power summit meeting scheduled to be held at the Élysée Palace will be the beginning of the summit meeting?"

Khrushchev gave the following answer to this question: "I am willing to participate in a meeting with French President de Gaulle, British Prime Minister Macmillan, and US President Eisenhower to exchange views on the question of whether the conditions for starting the summit meeting have been formed.

If the United States truly decides to condemn the perfidious act of American military aircraft invading Soviet airspace, publicly express regret for this intrusion, punish the criminals, and guarantee that such intrusions will not be repeated in the future, then we will be willing to participate in the summit meeting after receiving such guarantees."

    赫鲁晓夫谴责美国坚持侵略政策破坏四国会议
    美国政府如不谴责飞机挑衅行动，宣布放弃这种政策，惩办直接罪犯，苏联就不能参加会议——为了有一段时间澄清出现的问题，苏联认为四国会议应推迟六至八个月的时间——由于美机造成的形势，必须推迟艾森豪威尔访苏日期
    新华社17日讯　塔斯社巴黎16日讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫5月16日在有法国总统戴高乐、英国首相麦克米伦、美国总统艾森豪威尔、苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫以及他们的随行人员参加的政府首脑会议预备会议上发表了如下的声明：
    苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫向法国总统戴高乐、英国首相
    麦克米伦、美国总统艾森豪威尔发表的声明　1960年5月16日戴高乐总统先生！麦克米伦首相先生！艾森豪威尔总统先生！
    请允许我向你们发表声明如下：
    大家知道，最近发生了美国空军对苏联的挑衅行动。这种行动表现在：今年5月1日美国军用侦察机侵入苏联国境，进行一定的搜集有关苏联领土上的军事目标和工业目标的情报的间谍任务。当这架飞机飞行的侵略目的暴露以后，这架飞机就被苏联火箭部队击落了。遗憾的是，这并不是美国空军对苏联进行的唯一的侵略和间谍行动事件。苏联政府自然不得不对这种行动给予相应的估计，并指出这种行动同保持和平时期正常的国际关系的起码要求不相符合的背信弃义的性质，更不用说，这种行动粗暴地违背了缓和国际紧张局势和为最高级会议有效地进行工作创造必要条件的任务。这一点，在我在苏联最高苏维埃会议上的发言中以及在致美国政府的特别抗议照会中已经谈到了。
    起初，美国国务院胡说一气，说什么美国飞机侵入苏联国境是偶然的，不抱有任何间谍和破坏任务。而当在无可辩驳的事实的基础上揭露了这种说法的虚伪性以后，美国国务院在5月7日，而后来美国国务卿在5月9日以美国政府的名义声明，美国飞机是按照美国政府和总统本人批准的计划抱着军事间谍目的侵入苏联国境的。两天以后，艾森豪威尔总统本人证实，美国飞机在苏联领空的飞行过去是、将来仍然是美国所指靠的政策。
    美国政府在5月12日给苏联政府的照会中也声明了这一点，这样，美国政府就粗暴地践踏了公认的国际法准则和美国也签了字的联合国宪章的崇高原则。
    苏联政府和全体苏联人民得知美国国家领导人的这种声明后感到愤慨，世界上每一个关心和平命运的正直的人也同样感到愤慨。
    现在，当四大国政府领导人来到巴黎参加会议的时候，就出现了这样一个问题：当美国政府和总统本人不仅没有谴责美国军用飞机侵犯苏联国境的挑衅行动，反而声称，这种行动将来仍然是美国对苏联的国策的时候，如何能够有成效地进行会谈和讨论会议所面临的问题？当一个大国政府公然说，抱着间谍破坏目的侵入另一个大国的国境，从而也就是加紧国际紧张局势是它的政策的时候，怎能就这种或那种有待于解决的问题达成协议，以缓和国际紧张局势和消除国与国之间的怀疑和不信任呢？显然，宣布那种只有在各国处于战争状态条件下才能奉行的政策，事先就使最高级会议注定要彻底失败。
    当然，我们注意到了美国政府宣布的这种政策，并且表明，如果美国飞机再侵入苏联国境，我们就要把这些飞机击落。
    苏联政府保留在这一切情况下对那些侵犯苏联国家主权、对苏联进行这类间谍和破坏活动的人采取相应反击措施的权利。苏联政府再次声明，对于那些把自己的领土提供给美国做军事基地，成为对苏联进行侵略行动的帮凶的国家，也将采取应有的措施，直到对这些基地进行打击。
    这里，不能不提醒注意艾森豪威尔总统这样一种说法：他说，在有同德意志民主共和国缔结和约的威胁下，他不能参加最高级会议，虽然他所谓的威胁，只不过是苏联政府声明坚决地下决心要扫清欧洲战争的残迹、缔结和约，从而使局势、特别是西柏林的局势符合生活的要求、符合保障欧洲各国人民的和平和安全的利益而已。当美国政府声称它今后将继续侵犯苏联国境，美国飞机过去而且将来仍要在苏联领空飞行，当它作出这种真正威胁的时候，苏联政府怎么能够参加谈判呢？这样，美国政府就是表示它打算继续采取旨在反对苏维埃国家的主权的闻所未闻的史无前例的行动，而主权是国际关系中神圣的、不可动摇的原则。
    从所有这一切可以得出结论，为了使会议获得成功，所有与会国政府必须奉行开诚布公的诚实的政策，并郑重地宣布，它们彼此不再采取任何破坏国家主权的行动。这就是说，如果美国政府真正打算同其他大国政府合作，以维护和平和加强各国的信任，那么，它就应该：第一，谴责美国空军对苏联进行的不能容许的挑衅行动；第二，今后不再对苏联采取这种行动和奉行这种政策。不言而喻，美国政府在这种情况下不能不严惩那些直接参与预先计划好的美国飞机侵犯苏联国境事件的罪犯。
    在美国政府没有做到这一点之前，苏联政府看不到有同美国政府在最高级会议上进行有成就的谈判的可能性。它不能置身于这样一些谈判参加者之列：他们中间有一个参加者把背信弃义作为对苏联的政策的基础。
    如果苏联政府在目前情况下参加显然注定要失败的谈判，那么，它就成了欺骗各国人民的同谋者，然而，它不想成为这种同谋者。
    不言而喻，如果美国政府声明，它今后将不再以自己的飞机侵犯苏联的国境，谴责过去所干的挑衅行动，并惩办这种行动的直接罪犯。这样做就可保证苏联能有跟其他国家平等的条件，那么我作为苏联政府的首脑，愿意参加会议，并尽一切努力来促使会议成功。
    由于美国军用飞机的挑衅性飞行，而主要是由于宣布把将来进行这种挑衅性飞行作为美国对付社会主义国家的国策，就在国际关系中造成了新的情况。
    当然，在这种情况下，我们不能举行会议；之所以不能举行，是因为我们看到，人们想从什么立场来同我们打交道——即是想在用侵略性的侦察飞行进行威胁的情况下同我们打交道。大家知道，间谍飞行是抱着旨在发动战争的侦察目的而进行的。所以我们拒绝美国为我们造成的条件。我们不能参加任何谈判，不能参加解决那些即使已经成熟了的问题，我们之所以不能参加，是因为我们看到美国没有达成协议的愿望。
    美国在西方国家中被当作领袖。因而，目前的会议将会是白白地浪费时间，是欺骗各国舆论。我再重复一遍，在目前的情况下，我们不能参加谈判。
    我们只愿意在平等的基础上，在双方的可能性相等的情况下参加谈判。
    我们认为有必要使世界各国的人民和舆论都正确地理解我们。苏联不放弃努力来争取达成协议，我们相信，明智的协议是可以达成的，但是，显然不是在现在，而是在另外的时候。
    但是，要做到这一点，首先美国必须宣布，它对挑衅政策——它把这叫做在我国领空“自由”飞行的政策——加以谴责，宣布放弃这种政策，承认进行了侵略，并且对此表示遗憾。
    苏联政府深信，如果这一届美国政府不理解，那么下一届美国政府将会理解，如果下一届美国政府不理解，那么再下一届美国政府将会理解，除了资本主义制度和社会主义制度这两个制度的和平共处以外，再无别的出路，要么是和平共处，要么是战争，而战争将给那些正在奉行侵略政策的人带来巨大灾难。
    因此我们认为，必须有一段时间来澄清出现的问题，使那些负责决定国家政策方针的人分析一下，他们宣布在同苏联和其他社会主义国家关系中奉行侵略方针，应该负什么样的责任。所以我们认为，除了把政府首脑会议大约推迟六个月到八个月的时间之外，再没有更好的办法。
    苏联方面不会放松它为争取达成协议而作的努力。我想，舆论会正确地理解我们的立场，会理解，我们被剥夺了参加这种谈判的可能性。
    但是我们坚信必须和平共处，因为失去对和平共处的信念，就意味着使人类卷入战争，就意味着同意战争的不可避免性；而大家都知道，在目前条件下，战争会给世界各国人民带来怎样的灾难。
    我愿意向美国人民说几句话。我到过美国，在那里会见过各阶层美国人民，我深深相信，各阶层美国人民都不愿意战争。只有五角大楼的一小撮狂妄的集团和支持这一集团的军国主义分子例外，因为这些人靠军备竞赛过活，从中谋取暴利，他们无视美国人民的利益，也根本无视各国人民的利益，奉行着冒险政策。
    我们向戴高乐总统表示感谢，感谢他的殷切款待和提供在法国首都——巴黎会晤的可能性。我们也很重视英国政府和麦克米伦首相本人所作的努力。
    感到遗憾的是，这次会议被美国反动派通过美国军用飞机在苏联领空的挑衅性飞行破坏了。
    我们感到遗憾的是，这次会议没有导致世界各国人民期望会议会带来的结果。
    那些对苏联宣布强盗式政策的人应对此负责，他们是可耻的。
    大家知道，我同美国总统艾森豪威尔先生曾约定相互访问。我去年9月在美国进行了这种访问。我们很满意这次访问，很满意在美国进行的会晤和会谈，对此我已表示感谢。
    美国总统本应到我国进行回访。我们原来商定，他将在6月10日到我国来，我们也曾经准备好好地接待贵宾。
    很遗憾，由于对苏联的挑衅性侵略行动，现在形成了这样一种情况，即我们被剥夺了用苏联人接待他们所欢迎的客人时应有的那种殷切心情来接待总统的可能性。现在我们不可能对美国总统表示这样的殷切感情了，因为由于抱有侦察目的的美国军用飞机的挑衅飞行形成了对这种访问显然不利的条件。苏联人不会玩弄诡计，也不愿意玩弄诡计。
    因此，我们认为，现在必须推迟美国总统访问苏联的日期，当访问条件成熟时，再商定访问日期。那时苏联人民会对代表一个我们真诚希望与之和平友好相处的大国的贵宾表示应有的殷勤款待。
    我想，艾森豪威尔先生和美国人民将会正确地理解我。
    苏联政府声明，它这一方面今后将继续尽一切可能来促进国际紧张局势的缓和，促进那些今天还把我们分开的问题的解决；在这方面，我们将遵循加强以社会制度不同的各国和平共处为基础的和平这一伟大事业的利益。
    新华社17日讯　塔斯社巴黎讯：今天，报纸记者向赫鲁晓夫提出一个问题：“您对于白宫新闻秘书哈格蒂代表美国总统艾森豪威尔发表的关于今天预定在爱丽舍宫举行的四国首脑会见将是最高级会议的开始的声明有什么意见。”
    赫鲁晓夫对这个问题作了以下的回答：“我愿意参加为了就是否已经形成了开始举行最高级会议的条件的问题交换意见而同法国总统戴高乐、英国首相麦克米伦和美国总统艾森豪威尔举行的会议。
    如果美国真正决定谴责美国军用飞机入侵苏联领空的背信弃义的行为，对这次入侵公开表示遗憾，惩办罪犯，并保证今后这种入侵行为不再重演的话，那么，我们在得到这种保证后将愿意参加最高级会议”。
