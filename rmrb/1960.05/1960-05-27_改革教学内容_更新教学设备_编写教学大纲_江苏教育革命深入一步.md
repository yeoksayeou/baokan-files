    Reforming Teaching Content  Updating Teaching Equipment  Compiling Teaching Syllabuses
    Jiangsu's Educational Revolution Takes a Step Further
    (Reported by our newspaper) Schools at all levels in Jiangsu Province are actively carrying out teaching reform work. In March and April of this year, the Provincial Party Committee convened a provincial conference of middle school and normal school principals, and a provincial conference on education and health work, to convey and discuss the issue of teaching reform, and initially determined the measures and plans for teaching reform. Afterwards, the province immediately organized teachers to conscientiously study Vice Premier Lu Dingyi's article on "Teaching Must Be Reformed," and carried out publicity and education work among students, parents, and the general public, thereby establishing teaching reform on a solid ideological foundation.
    Currently, under the direct leadership of educational administrative departments at all levels, schools in various parts of Jiangsu are conducting planned experiments to reform teaching methods and teaching content. After removing the repetitive and excessive background information and author introductions from the textbooks, the Chinese language teachers at Nanjing No. 10 Middle School greatly shortened teaching time in accordance with the spirit of emphasizing thorough explanation and extensive practice. After improving mathematics teaching methods, Huaian Normal School completed the teaching tasks of the past seventy-two teaching hours in only fifty-four teaching hours.
    Gradually updating teaching equipment has received increased attention from schools in various regions. When lecturing on blood circulation in biology class, Nanjing No. 12 Middle School used slides for teaching, which not only saved teaching time but also improved teaching quality. Many schools have adopted a combination of indigenous and foreign methods to vigorously develop the production of teaching aids and instruments, achieving preliminary results.
    Schools in various parts of Jiangsu are also conducting research, formulating, and compiling education plans, teaching syllabuses, and textbooks. The provincial education administrative department has gathered more than 1,600 people at Nanjing Normal College to compile teaching syllabuses and textbooks for the trial implementation of the school system. As of the 16th, the first draft has been basically completed. Many schools, such as Sihong County Middle School, Tongshan Zhengji Middle School, Yangzhou Normal Affiliated Elementary School, and Nanjing Normal College Affiliated Elementary School, have also organized manpower to formulate draft education plans and teaching syllabuses for various subjects in pilot schools. Jiangsu Normal College has written drafts of some teaching materials. Xuzhou City also put forward specific opinions on the content of teaching innovation courses for each grade and subject in non-pilot schools, and on improving teaching methods. These materials have been sent to the Jiangsu Provincial Middle and Primary School Textbook Editorial Committee for reference when studying, formulating, and compiling unified education plans, teaching syllabuses, and textbooks.
    In order to carry out teaching reform more deeply, the Education and Health Department of the Provincial Party Committee recently held a middle and primary school teaching reform work conference in Nanjing, conscientiously reviewed the teaching reform situation in middle and primary schools in various regions, and required schools in various regions to pay attention to the following points in teaching reform work: First, vigorously improve teaching quality. The relationship between major and general subjects should be correctly handled, with particular emphasis on improving the quality of Chinese (including foreign languages) and mathematics. Second, improve students' health. Run the catering well, pay attention to the combination of work and rest, actively carry out sports and recreational activities, and do a good job in sanitation. Third, appropriately shorten the duration of schooling, appropriately raise the level of teaching, appropriately control class hours, and appropriately increase labor. These four "appropriates" are a unified whole, and must be fully understood, fully studied, and fully arranged.

    改革教学内容  更新教学设备  编写教学大纲
    江苏教育革命深入一步
    本报讯　江苏省各中、小学校积极进行教学改革工作。今年3、4月间，省委召开了全省中学、师范校长会议和全省教育卫生工作会议，传达和讨论了教学改革问题，并初步确定了教学改革的措施方案。之后，立即组织全省教师认真学习了陆定一副总理关于
  “教学必须改革”的文章，并对学生、家长和广大群众开展了宣传教育工作，从而把教学改革建立在巩固的思想基础上。
    目前，江苏各地学校在各级教育行政部门直接领导下，正在有计划地进行改革教学方法和教学内容的试验。南京市第十中学语文教师根据精讲多练的精神，省去了教材中重复的、过多的时代背景和作者介绍以后，大大缩短了教学时间。淮阴师范改进了数学教学方法以后，只用五十四教时就完成了过去七十二教时的教学任务。
    逐步更新教学设备，已经进一步引起各地学校的重视。南京市十二中在讲生物课血液循环时，用幻灯进行教学，既节省了教时，又提高了教学质量。很多学校采用土洋结合的办法，大搞教具、仪器制作，取得了初步成绩。
    江苏各地学校还正在对教育计划、教学大纲和教材进行研究、制订和编写工作。省教育行政部门已集中一千六百多人，在南京师范学院编写试行学制的教学大纲和教材。到16日止，初稿已经基本完成。泗洪县中、铜山郑集中学、扬州师范附小、南京师院附小等许多学校，也都组织人力制订了试点学校的教育计划和各科教学大纲的草案。江苏师范学院已经写好了部分教材的草稿。徐州市还提出了非试点学校各年级各科教学革新课程内容，和改进教学方法的具体意见。这些资料都已经送到江苏省中小学教材编辑委员会，供研究、制订和编写统一的教育计划、教学大纲、教材时参考。
    为了更深入地进行教学改革，省委教育卫生部最近又在南京召开了中、小学教学改革工作会议，认真检查了各地中、小学教学改革的情况，并要求各地学校在教学改革工作中注意做到：第一，大力提高教学质量。应当正确处理主要学科和一般学科的关系，特别着重提高语文（包括外语）和数学的质量。第二，增进学生的健康。认真办好伙食，注意劳逸结合，积极开展体育文娱活动，作好卫生工作。第三，适当缩短年限，适当提高程度，适当控制学时，适当增加劳动，这四个适当是统一的整体，必须全面理解，全面研究，全面安排。
