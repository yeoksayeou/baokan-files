    The Heroic Struggle of the Miike Coal Mine Workers
    Lan Hai
    Currently, amidst the massive unified action by the Japanese people opposing the Diet's ratification of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, the Miike Coal Mine workers, standing at the forefront of the workers' struggle, are persistently carrying out a heroic struggle against suppression and layoffs.
    The Miike Coal Mine, belonging to Mitsui Mining Co., Ltd., is located in Omuta City, Fukuoka Prefecture, Kyushu, Japan. It employs 14,500 miners and is one of the largest coal mines in Japan. After the Miike Coal Mine capitalists proposed a so-called "enterprise rationalization" plan to lay off 1,200 workers in August of last year, the workers launched protest actions, including strikes, under the leadership of the union. After the company officially announced the layoff notices in December, especially after the company conspired to forcibly close the mine on January 25th of this year to deal with the workers' struggle, it further enraged the Miike Coal Mine workers, who immediately transitioned to a full-scale strike. Despite the bloody suppression and sabotage by the Kishi Nobusuke government and monopoly capital, they have persisted to this day, writing a glorious page in the history of the Japanese labor movement.
    The struggle of the Miike Coal Mine workers against the Mitsui zaibatsu's mass layoffs is a great struggle to defend the vital interests of the working class, protect the right to survival, and defend the democratic rights of the union. This struggle is closely linked to the Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and therefore has very important political significance. With the signing of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, U.S. and Japanese monopoly capital are intensifying their collusion under the guise of so-called "economic cooperation." On the one hand, U.S. monopoly capital wants to take this opportunity to massively infiltrate Japan and strengthen its exploitation of the Japanese working class. On the other hand, Japanese monopoly capital is also attempting to rely on U.S. capital and technology to implement so-called "enterprise rationalization" in order to seize even greater profits. As for the coal industry sector, it has been sluggish in recent years, suffering from the severe impact of the overproduction crisis. Therefore, coal industry capitalists especially want to shift the consequences of the crisis to the workers through "enterprise rationalization" involving updating equipment and mass layoffs, thereby snatching away the jobs of 1,200 workers at once!
    The Mitsui zaibatsu's crime of trampling on the workers' right to survival aims far beyond simply laying off a group of workers. This is a class battle with the nature of an "assault" launched by the entire monopoly capital, centered on the Mitsui zaibatsu, against the entire working class. The aim is to undermine and disintegrate the entire labor movement front, so that the broad masses of workers become docile slaves to be exploited by U.S. and Japanese monopoly capital in the new situation of U.S.-Japan "economic cooperation." As everyone knows, "Sohyo" is the most powerful trade union organization in Japan, and the most powerful union within "Sohyo" is the Japan Coal Miners' Union, and the Miike Coal Mine Union is the strongest fortress of the latter. Therefore, the spearhead of monopoly capital's attack is directed at the Miike Coal Mine Union. Just a glance at the layoff list proposed by the Mitsui zaibatsu is enough to illustrate this point. Of the 1,200 workers identified for dismissal, more than half are Communist Party members, Socialist Party members, and non-party union activists. Moreover, the Communist Party members and Socialist Party members who were identified for dismissal each account for more than half of the total number of party members in the two parties in the coal mine. Obviously, the monopolists are attempting to disintegrate the Miike Coal Mine Union through layoffs.
    This offensive provoked by the Mitsui zaibatsu has received strong support from the Kishi Nobusuke government. The Kishi Nobusuke government colluded with monopoly capitalists, mobilized four to five thousand armed police to suppress the workers' struggle in the Miike Coal Mine. On March 28th and 29th of this year, the capitalists hired a large number of professional thugs who injured hundreds of workers in the Miike Coal Mine and stabbed the worker Kubo Kiyoshi to death with a dagger. First, the Kishi Nobusuke government's "Maritime Safety Agency" sent ships to help the company transport the thugs to the vicinity of the mine. Then, on the day of the assault, the Kishi Nobusuke government's police stood by and watched the thugs commit violence, and did everything possible to prevent the workers from fighting back. In the seven or eight months since the Miike Coal Mine workers persisted in their struggle, about three hundred workers have been beaten and arrested by the Kishi Nobusuke government's police. After the murder of Kubo Kiyoshi, the struggle of the Miike Coal Mine workers not only did not weaken in the slightest, but instead ignited a more intense flame of struggle with the support of workers and people from all walks of life across the country. In a state of panic, the Kishi Nobusuke government came forward in early April with Keizo Fujibayashi, chairman of the Central Labor Relations Commission, to conduct "mediation," attempting to use bribery, co-optation, and the forces of puppet unions to clean up the situation with the so-called "Fujibayashi Mediation Plan." However, the so-called "Fujibayashi Mediation Plan" on the one hand said "cancel the layoff plan," and on the other hand said "those designated will be regarded as automatic retirement from the date of the announcement." This is not a "mediation plan" at all. In essence, it is forcing the workers to accept the company's original plan by changing the soup but not the medicine. This completely exposed the Kishi Nobusuke government's true face as a faithful servant of monopoly capital. The Japan Coal Miners' Union, at its national congress held in mid-April, passed a resolution rejecting the Kishi Nobusuke government's "mediation plan," dealing a serious blow to the conspiracy of the Kishi Nobusuke government and the coal industry capitalists.
    The Japanese coal miners and the entire working class are the strongest force in the anti-U.S. patriotic struggle centered on opposing the U.S.-Japan military alliance. The Miike Coal Mine workers not only stand at the forefront of resisting the attack of monopoly capital, but also stand at the forefront of the anti-U.S. patriotic struggle. Precisely because of this, the Kishi Nobusuke government does not hesitate to adopt various conspiratorial and violent means to suppress and undermine the struggle of the Miike Coal Mine workers. After the failure of the "Fujibayashi Mediation Plan," the Kishi Nobusuke government's suppression activities have become even more frantic, with incidents of police beating and arresting workers emerging one after another. However, the Kishi Nobusuke government's knives and clubs have not only failed to scare away the Miike Coal Mine workers and the entire Japanese working class, but on the contrary, their fighting spirit has become stronger and their unity has become more consolidated. Since the murder of Kubo Kiyoshi, the entire Japanese working class and the people across the country have been more actively supporting the struggle of the Miike Coal Mine workers. Around the 15th unified action against the Diet's ratification of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, news of workers fighting with the police constantly came from the Miike Coal Mine, showing the heroic spirit of the Miike Coal Mine workers' struggle.
    The Miike Coal Mine workers have a glorious history of heroic struggle. As early as 1953, they persisted in a record-breaking 113-day strike, and finally succeeded in forcing the company to withdraw its plan to lay off 1,800 workers. Today, the domestic and international situation in Japan is very favorable to the anti-U.S. patriotic struggle of the Miike Coal Mine workers and all workers and people. As long as they consistently maintain unity and persist in a heroic and unyielding struggle, they will surely achieve greater victories.

    三池煤矿工人的英勇斗争
    蓝海
    目前，在日本人民展开声势浩大的反对国会批准日美军事同盟条约第十六次统一行动中，站在工人斗争最前线的三池煤矿工人正在坚持不懈地进行反镇压、反解雇的英勇斗争。
    属于三井矿山公司的三池煤矿，位于日本九州福冈县大牟田市，拥有矿工一万四千五百人，是日本最大的煤矿之一。三池煤矿资本家于去年8月提出了解雇一千二百名工人的所谓“企业合理化”方案后，工人们便在工会领导下展开了包括罢工在内的抗议行动。在去年12月资方正式宣布解雇通知，特别是今年1月25日资方阴谋用强行封闭矿山办法来对付工人斗争后，更加激怒了三池煤矿工人，他们立即转入全面罢工的行动，而且不顾岸信介政府和垄断资本的血腥镇压和阴谋破坏，一直坚持到今天，在日本工人运动史上写下了光辉的一页。
    三池煤矿工人反对三井财阀大批解雇工人的斗争，是一次保卫工人阶级切身利益、保卫生存权利和工会民主权利的巨大斗争。这一斗争同日本人民反对日美“安全条约”的斗争有密切的联系，因而具有十分重大的政治意义。随着日美军事同盟条约的签订，日美垄断资本正在所谓“经济合作”的幌子下加紧勾结。一方面美国垄断资本要借此大举渗入日本，加强对日本工人阶级的压榨，另一方面日本垄断资本也企图依靠美国资本和技术力量来实行所谓“企业合理化”，以攫取更大的利润。而从煤炭工业部门来说，近年来它一直不景气，遭受了生产过剩危机的严重打击。因此，煤炭工业资本家尤其想通过更新设备和大批裁减工人的“企业合理化”，把危机的后果转嫁给工人，因而一次就要抢走一千二百名工人的饭碗！
    三井财阀这一蹂躏工人生存权利的罪恶，其目的远不止于解雇一批工人而已。这是以三井财阀等核心的整个垄断资本对整个工人阶级发动的一次具有“攻坚战”性质的阶级战斗。其目的是要破坏和瓦解整个工人运动战线，使广大工人在日美“经济合作”的新局面下变成任日美垄断资本榨取的顺从的奴隶。大家知道，日本“总评”是日本最强大的工会组织，而“总评”所属的工会中最强大的是日本煤矿工会，三池煤矿工会又是后者最坚强的堡垒。所以，垄断资本的进攻矛头指向了三池煤矿工会。只消看一下三井财阀提出的解雇名单就足以说明这一点。在被确定指名解雇的一千二百名工人中，有二分之一以上是共产党员和社会党员及非党工会积极分子。而被指名解雇的共产党员和社会党员又各占该煤矿中两党全体党员人数的一半以上。显然，垄断资本家是企图以解雇的方式来瓦解三池煤矿工会。
    三井财阀挑起的这一攻势，得到了岸信介政府的大力支持。岸信介政府同垄断资本家合谋，调集了四、五千个武装警察在三池煤矿大肆镇压工人的斗争。今年3月28、29两天，资本家雇用大批职业流氓打手，在三池煤矿打伤了一百几十名工人，而且用匕首刺杀了工人久保清。先是岸信介政府“海上保安厅”派舰艇帮助公司把这批打手运到矿山附近，后来在行凶当天岸信介政府的警察又坐视坏蛋们行凶，并且百般地阻挠工人们反击。在三池煤矿工人坚持斗争七、八个月以来，被岸信介政府警察殴打和逮捕的工人已达三百来人。在杀害久保清之后，三池煤矿工人的斗争不仅没有丝毫削弱，反而在全国工人和各界人民支援下燃起了更炽烈的斗争火焰。惊慌失措的岸信介政府在4月初由中央劳动委员会会长藤林敬三出面进行“调停”，企图借助收买和拉拢以及利用御用工会势力，以所谓“藤林调停案”来收拾局面。但是，所谓“藤林调停案”一面说什么“撤消解雇方案”，一面又说“被指名者从宣布当天起作为自动退职”。这根本不是什么“调停案”，实质上是以换汤不换药手法强迫工人接受资本家的原案。这完全暴露了岸信介政府是垄断资本忠实奴仆的嘴脸。日本煤矿工会在4月中旬召开的全国大会，通过决议，拒绝了岸信介政府的这一“调停案”，使岸信介政府和煤炭工业资本家的阴谋遭到了严重的打击。
    日本煤矿工人和全体工人阶级是以反对日美军事同盟为中心的反美爱国斗争中最坚强的力量。三池煤矿工人不仅站在反击垄断资本进攻的最前线，而且是站在反美爱国斗争的前列。正是因为这样，岸信介政府才不惜采取各种阴谋暴力手段来镇压和破坏三池煤矿工人的斗争。在“藤林调停案”失败后，近来岸信介政府的镇压活动更加疯狂，警察殴打和逮捕工人的事件层出不穷。但是，岸信介政府的屠刀和警棍不仅没有吓退三池煤矿工人和整个日本工人阶级，相反地，他们的斗志更加坚强，团结更加巩固了。自从久保清被杀害后，日本全体工人阶级和全国人民更加积极支援三池煤矿工人的斗争，而在反对国会批准日美军事同盟条约的第十五次统一行动前后，从三池煤矿不断传出工人同警察搏斗的消息显示了三池煤矿工人英勇斗争的气概。
    三池煤矿工人有着英勇斗争的光荣历史。早在1953年他们就曾坚持了创纪录式的一百一十三天大罢工，终于取得了迫使资方收回解雇一千八百名工人的计划。今天，日本国内外的形势对三池煤矿工人和全体工人与人民的反美爱国斗争十分有利。只要他们始终坚持团结，坚持英勇不屈的斗争，他们一定会取得更大的胜利。
