Xinhua News Agency, 11th dispatch from Moscow: Many diplomatic officials from foreign missions in the Soviet Union visited a club in the Central Cultural Rest Park in Moscow on the 11th to view various material evidences proving the U.S. aircraft's intrusion into Soviet airspace on May 1 for reconnaissance and espionage activities. After the visit, the foreign diplomatic officials wrote many impressions in the guestbook. They pointed out that the U.S. authorities should bear full responsibility for sending spy planes to the Soviet Union. Foreign diplomatic officials visited the exhibition stand and watched the wreckage of the "Lockheed U-2" spy plane shot down by Soviet rockets in the Sverdlovsk region. Also on display were: the "Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Company" manufactured engine, explosives, ejection seat, fuselage tail, oxygen cylinders, high-altitude flying suits, and various equipment items such as tools for conducting espionage activities: silent pistols, daggers, highly poisonous substances, Soviet rubles, and foreign currency carried by the plane's pilot, Powers.

On specially made exhibition boards, one could see: photographs of pilot Powers, as well as various documents proving his service to U.S. intelligence agencies, and records of his confessions during interrogation.

Also visible here were the various telecommunications equipment, instruments, cameras, and developed negatives of the U.S. aircraft that invaded the Soviet Union. On these negatives, one could clearly see: airports where Soviet fighter planes were parked, railway hubs with locomotives and vehicles coming and going, and industrial enterprises. On the audio tape open to foreign diplomatic officials, there were signals of Soviet radar stations recorded by pilot Powers.

While viewing the exhibits, it was noteworthy that many instruments and equipment were affixed with labels from U.S. companies inspecting and certifying the instruments were suitable for flight. Some parts had markings indicating that these parts were inspected in January and March of this year and belonged to the U.S. government or military authorities.

All of this material conclusively proves that the aircraft sent by the U.S. military authorities to invade Soviet airspace was engaged in espionage activities.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 11th dispatch: The "Soviet Air Force News" reported on the 10th that there was a certificate issued to pilot Powers in the cabin of the U.S. aircraft shot down by Soviet rocket forces on May 1. Carrying this certificate, the pilot could use any type of aircraft of the U.S. Air Force from any air force base. The certificate was signed by U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff Thomas White.

This piece of evidence was provided by a Soviet military officer who had visited the crash site to observe the wreckage of the U-2 aircraft.

The officer said that due to the accurate hit by the Soviet missiles, the aircraft was broken into several parts, which fell in different locations within about fifteen kilometers.

The officer first found two large boxes containing aerial photography film, each box about forty centimeters in diameter. Half of the film was in the film cartridges, which proved that the aerial bandit had taken a large number of photos. From the film and the broken camera, it could be seen that these things were purely for reconnaissance purposes. He said that the radio and electronic equipment on the aircraft had been damaged, but many of the inscriptions remaining on the instruments indicated that these instruments were manufactured by U.S. companies.

Also found at the crash site was a navigation chart with a scale of 1:2,000,000, marked with a route from the Pakistan region through Soviet territory to Budø Airport in Norway.

The officer concluded that, after initial observation, it was sufficient to show that the U-2 aircraft was a specialized high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft of the U.S. Air Force, and its purpose was to conduct reconnaissance and aerial photography, and that the despicable intrusion into Soviet airspace was carefully prepared in advance and carried out under the direct instructions of the U.S. Air Force leaders.

    美国侵略罪行铁证如山
    各国驻苏外交官参观美机侵苏罪证
    苏联一军官提供美机挑衅的新证据
    新华社11日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：各国驻苏联外交使团的许多外交官员，11日前往莫斯科中央文化休息公园的一个俱乐部，参观了在那里展出的证明美国飞机5月1日侵犯苏联领空进行侦察间谍活动的各种物证。参观后，各国外交官员在留言簿上写了许多观感。他们指出，美国当局应当对向苏联派遣间谍飞机负完全责任。各国外交官员参观了展览台，观看这架被苏联火箭在斯维德洛夫斯克地区击毁的“洛克希德U—2型”间谍飞机的残骸。这里还展出了：“普拉特—怀特奈飞机公司”制造的发动机，炸药、弹射座椅、机身尾部、氧气瓶、高空飞行衣、各种各样的装备品，诸如进行特务活动的工具：无声手枪、匕首、烈性毒物，苏联卢布和这架飞机的飞行员鲍尔士所携带的外国货币。
    在特制的展览牌上可以看到：飞行员鲍尔士的照片以及证明他为美国侦察机关服务的各种证件和他在受审问时所作的供词的记录。
    在这里还可以看到这架入侵苏联的美国飞机的各种电讯设备、仪器、照像机、显影底片。在这些底片上，可以清楚地看到：停着苏联歼击机的机场、有着机车车辆来往的铁路枢纽、工业企业。在为各国外交官员开放的录音带上，有飞行员鲍尔士录下的苏联雷达站的讯号。
    在观看展览品时，使人注目的是，许多仪器和设备上都贴有美国公司检验和证明仪器适合飞行的标签。在某些机件上有字样注明，这些机件是在今年1月和3月检验的，是属于美国政府或者军事主管机关所有的。
    所有这一切材料确凿地证明了，美国军事当局派遣的入侵苏联领空的飞机是进行间谍活动的。
    新华社莫斯科11日电　“苏联空军报”10日报道说，在5月1日被苏联火箭部队击落的美国飞机机舱中，有一份发给飞行员鲍尔士的证明。携带此证明，飞行员可以从任何空军基地利用美国空军任何型号的飞机。在这一证明上签字的是美国空军参谋长托马斯·怀特。
    这一罪证是一位曾经前往飞机坠毁地点观察过Ｕ—2型飞机残骸的苏军军官提供的。
    这位军官说，由于苏联导弹的准确击中，飞机被击破成几部分，它们分别掉落在约十五公里以内各个不同的地点。
    这位军官首先找到的是两个装有空中摄影胶卷的大盒子，每个盒子的直径约为四十厘米。一半胶卷是在胶卷筒中的，这证明空中强盗已摄下了大量照片。从胶卷和破碎了的摄影机可以看出这些东西是纯粹作侦察用的。他说，飞机上的无线电和电子设备已损坏，但是留在仪器上的许多字迹表明，这些仪器都是美国公司制造的。
    在飞机坠毁地点还发现了一张比例为一比二百万的航行图，上面标有从巴基斯坦地区经过苏联领土到挪威布德机场的路线。
    这位军官最后说，经过初步观察，已足够说明Ｕ—2型飞机是美国空军的一架专门的高空侦察机，它的目的是进行从事侦察和空中摄影，而卑鄙地侵入苏联领空是早就有周密准备，并且是在美国空军领导人直接指示下进行的。
