    The United States Deliberately Evades Disarmament
    By Our Staff Commentator
    The East-West Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee conference, which began in Geneva on March 15, adjourned on April 29. The first phase of the conference fully exposed the intention of the Western countries, headed by the United States, to evade genuine disarmament and to do everything possible to obstruct the genuine relaxation of the international situation. The attitude of the United States and its partners at the disarmament conference makes it entirely clear that the United States' so-called "willingness to seek peace" is nothing but a deceptive trick.
    Last year, under the strong pressure of the people of the world demanding disarmament, the United States and other Western countries had no choice but to agree to resume disarmament negotiations, which had been interrupted for three years. The Ten-Nation Committee has the mission of drafting an agreement to achieve comprehensive disarmament under international supervision, and last year's UN General Assembly unanimously adopted a resolution in favor of the proposition of complete and thorough disarmament and referred the Soviet Union's proposal on this issue to the Committee for detailed discussion. However, at the beginning of the conference, the five Western powers put forward a "disarmament" plan which only talked about international supervision of armaments, while putting the actual measures to achieve disarmament into the indefinite future, and these measures did not even include important steps to eliminate the threat of war, such as stopping nuclear tests and eliminating military bases on foreign territories. This plan fully exposed the old trick of the Western countries of playing with supervision instead of disarmament in order to delay. During the month and a half of the conference, the Western countries have consistently adhered to this untenable proposition, engaging in unreasonable entanglement, obstructing the discussion of practical disarmament measures, and refusing to begin drafting a treaty on complete and thorough disarmament. They even attempted to deny the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee's task of reaching an agreement on complete and thorough disarmament. In order to overcome the difficulties in the conference and seek a common basis for reaching an agreement, the Soviet Union and other socialist countries put forward a new proposal of "basic principles for complete and thorough disarmament," demanding that the Western countries first reach agreement on the basic principles of disarmament, so as to ensure the early resolution of the issue of complete and thorough disarmament. However, the Western countries evaded discussing this proposal under various pretexts, and the US representative even blatantly stated that he refused to undertake the obligation not to be the first to use nuclear weapons. Thus, the conspiracy of the United States and other Western countries to obstruct disarmament became obvious. In order to cover up their position of undermining the conference, the Western countries also put forward so-called nine "specific measures" and four "principles and conditions" to confuse the public, but these suggestions, which were merely old wine in new bottles, were nothing more than attempts to lead the disarmament negotiations onto the old path of protracted delays in order to avoid formulating a complete and thorough disarmament plan. The United States' intention regarding the disarmament conference is very clear. What the United States hopes for is not the achievement of complete and thorough disarmament, but that the disarmament conference should either accept its supervision plan without disarmament, or achieve no results. The former result is conducive to its collection of military intelligence on socialist countries, which is of great benefit to its arms expansion and war preparation plan; the latter result also conforms to its plan to buy time to expand its military strength, because in this way the United States can escape the pressure of the world's people demanding disarmament and the condemnation of its intensified arms expansion activities. Responsible officials of the US government have repeatedly stated that the United States must maintain its strength before reaching a disarmament agreement, and clamored for "seeking peace from strength." During the disarmament conference, Washington also released information saying that the disarmament conference would last for several years. It can be seen that the United States is completely "confident" in obstructing the progress of the conference. It is no accident that Washington appointed Eaton, the owner of an arms company, as the head of the US delegation.
    However, the United States, while clearly doing everything possible to obstruct the conclusion of a disarmament agreement, wants to shift the responsibility for the failure of the conference to the Soviet Union. During the conference, the US propaganda machine constantly spread rumors smearing the Soviet Union for refusing complete and thorough disarmament in an attempt to confuse public opinion. It is particularly shameless that US Secretary of State Herter actually lied and described the decision to adjourn the meeting, which had been discussed by both sides, as a "trick" by the Soviet Union to delay the meeting. But all the tricks of creating rumors and slander are obviously in vain. The people of all countries can clearly see who is making unremitting efforts in the disarmament conference and who is intensifying arms expansion and war preparations under the smoke screen of empty talk about disarmament. Even the American reporter Hightower admitted that the military interests sought by the United States and other Western countries on the issue of disarmament are consistent with their global defensive position (should be read as plans for aggressive war).
    The disarmament conference will be adjourned until June 7. It is worth noting that the Western countries have refused to state in the adjournment communiqué of the conference that the members of the committee believe that it is necessary to continue negotiations after the adjournment in order to formulate the basic principles and plans for complete and thorough disarmament under effective international supervision in accordance with the UN General Assembly's resolution on complete and thorough disarmament. Isn't it very clear what the Western countries intend to do in the subsequent disarmament conference? However, no matter what tricks the United States continues to play, it can only more thoroughly expose the United States' sinister conspiracy to cover up its stepped-up arms race with extravagant talk of disarmament.

    美国蓄意逃避裁军
    本报评论员
    从3月15日开始在日内瓦举行的东西方十国裁军委员会会议已于4月29日休会。会议第一阶段的进程完全暴露了以美国为首的西方国家存心逃避真正的裁军和竭力阻挠国际局势的真正缓和。人们从美国及其伙伴在裁军会议上所耍的态度，也就可以完全看穿美国所谓“愿意谋求和平”的骗人把戏。
    去年，美国和其他西方国家是在全世界人民要求裁军的强大压力下，才不得不同意恢复已经中断了三年的裁军谈判的。十国委员会负有拟定在国际监督下实现全面裁军的协议的使命，而且去年的联合国大会一致决议赞成全面彻底裁军的主张，并且把苏联关于这一问题的建议交给这个委员会详细讨论。但是，在会议一开始，西方五国就提出了一个“裁军”方案，这个方案只谈对军备的国际监督，而把实现裁军的一些实际措施，放在遥遥无期的将来，而这些措施甚至不包括停止核试验和取消国外领土上的军事基地等消除战争威胁的重要步骤。这个方案充分暴露了西方国家仍然在玩弄以监督代替裁军的拖延老手法。在一个半月的会议中，西方国家一直坚持这个早已站不住脚的主张，进行无理的纠缠，阻挠讨论裁军的实际措施，拒绝着手制定全面彻底裁军的条约。它们甚至企图否定十国裁军委员会就全面和彻底裁军达成协议的任务。苏联和其他社会主义国家为了克服会议中的困难，寻求达成协议的共同基础，又提出了“全面彻底裁军的基本原则”的新建议，要求西方国家首先在裁军的基本原则方面取得一致意见，从而保证尽快解决全面彻底裁军问题。但是西方国家却用各种借口来规避讨论这一建议，美国代表甚至悍然表示拒绝承担不首先使用核武器的义务。这样，美国和其他西方国家阻挠裁军的阴谋就昭然若揭。为了掩饰他们破坏会议的立场，西方国家又曾提出所谓九项“具体措施”和四项“原则和条件”等来混淆视听，但是这些换汤不换药的建议，也无非企图把裁军谈判引上旷日持久的老路，来逃避制订全面彻底裁军方案罢了。美国对裁军会议所打的主意是十分清楚的。美国所希望的决不是什么实现全面彻底的裁军，它的目的是使裁军会议要末接受它的没有裁军的监督计划，要末就毫无成果。前一种结果有利于它搜集社会主义国家的军事情报，对它的扩军备战计划大有好处；后一种结果则也符合于它争取时间扩充军事力量的计划，因为这样美国就可以逃避世界人民要求裁军的压力和对它加紧进行扩军活动的谴责。美国政府的负责官员早已一再声明美国在达成裁军协议之前必须保持实力，叫嚷“从实力谋求和平”。在裁军会议进行期间，华盛顿方面还放出空气，说裁军会议要举行几年之久。可见美国在阻挠会议的进展方面是完全“胸有成竹”的。而华盛顿指派了伊顿这样一个军火企业的老板充当美国代表团的团长，也不是偶然的。
    然而，美国明明竭力阻挠达成裁军的协议，却想把会议不能有所进展的责任推到苏联的身上。在会议进行的期间，美国的宣传机器就不断散布诬蔑苏联拒绝全面彻底裁军的谰言，以图迷惑舆论。特别无耻的是，美国国务卿赫脱居然扯谎，把经过双方商量的关于休会的决定说成是苏联拖延会议的“手腕”。但是一切造谣中伤的伎俩显然都是白费的。各国人民清楚地看得出究竟谁在裁军会议中进行不懈的努力，又是谁在空谈裁军的烟幕下加紧进行着扩军备战。连美国的记者海托华也承认，美国和其他西方国家“在裁军问题上所寻求的军事利益是同它们的全球性防御地位（应读作侵略战争计划）一致的”。
    裁军会议将休会到6月7日。值得注意的是，西方国家竟然拒绝在会议的休会公报中声明：委员会各成员认为在休会之后有必要继续谈判，以便根据联合国大会关于全面彻底裁军的决议，拟订在有效的国际监督下的全面彻底裁军的基本原则和计划。西方国家准备在以后的裁军会议上作何打算不是很清楚了吗？但是，不管美国继续玩弄什么花样，它只能更彻底地暴露美国用侈谈裁军来掩护加紧备战的罪恶阴谋。
