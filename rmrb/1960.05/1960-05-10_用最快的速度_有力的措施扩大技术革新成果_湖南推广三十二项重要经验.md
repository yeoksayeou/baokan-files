(Dispatch from Changsha, May 9th) The technological innovation and technological revolution movement in Hunan Province has entered a new stage of vigorously grasping summarization, improvement, and promotion.

According to preliminary statistics at the end of March, the mass movement of technological innovation and technological revolution in Hunan Province, centered on "four modernizations," resulted in a total of more than 3.7 million innovation proposals from workers and staff, of which more than 1.14 million were implemented. The realization of a large number of innovative proposals has greatly promoted current production. In the first quarter, the province exceeded the state plan by 14.1%, an increase of 4.4% and 14.1% compared with the fourth quarter of last year and the same period last year, respectively. Labor productivity increased by 5.8% in January compared with December last year, 4.2% in February compared with January, and another 6.2% in March compared with February.

At the end of March, the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China summarized and analyzed the previous stage of the technological innovation and technological revolution movement in the province. It was believed that during the previous period, workers and staff made many inventions and creations, and there were many major innovation creations, some of which could increase work efficiency many times over. However, since the movement had just begun, some units had not yet caught up with the summarization, improvement, and promotion of these advanced experiences. The Provincial Committee believes that it is an extremely urgent issue to use the fastest speed and take the most powerful measures to rapidly promote the advanced experiences and technologies created by this enterprise, this region, and other provinces and regions in all fronts and industries throughout the province, to make them blossom and bear fruit everywhere. The Provincial Committee believes that in the process of popularization and promotion, continuously improving and perfecting advanced experiences and technologies, and further enlightening the wisdom of the masses, is an important method to continuously promote the technological innovation and technological revolution movement forward. Therefore, the Provincial Committee decided that from April 1st to the end of April, while mobilizing the masses to vigorously engage in innovation and creation, it would focus on grasping the work of summarizing, improving, and promoting advanced experiences and technologies. Moreover, this work was listed as an important link to further promote the movement forward.

In order to quickly summarize advanced experiences and technologies, improve them, and promote them, Hunan Province first selected the most important key projects from the existing inventions and creations in various industries and summarized them. In April, the province concentrated its efforts on summarizing innovation experiences in the following four aspects: First, with coal as the leader, vigorously promote advanced experiences and technologies in the production of raw materials centered on coal, iron, and steel; Second, in transportation, vigorously promote advanced experiences and technologies mainly aimed at increasing carrying capacity; Third, in infrastructure construction, mainly speed up construction and design progress, and improve project quality; Fourth, with electricity as the representative, mainly improve power output. Subsequently, with these four aspects as the center, the province identified thirty-two key promotion projects. In order to first solve key problems, ten major projects were identified from these thirty-two projects as the key among the key promotion projects. In iron smelting, the focus was on promoting the high-quality and high-yield experience of Songbai Iron Plant in Changning County; in coal production and conservation and comprehensive utilization, the focus was on promoting the coal-digging ax-type coal mining machine created by Zhou Kai-duan, a worker at Qibaoshan Coal Mine in Qidong County, the earthen water pump of Yunfeng Coal Mine, and coal gasification; in coking, the rapid flow-line coking furnace was promoted; in power, the "four-in-one" ring power supply was promoted; in building materials production, the focus was on promoting the transformation of low-grade cement into high-grade cement; in transportation, the two-boat assistance method and automobile towing were promoted; in geology, the experience of the metallurgical exploration company reaching the thousand-meter company was promoted. The Provincial Committee believes that the rapid promotion of these advanced experiences is of great significance to promoting current production.

In order to ensure that these key projects can be rapidly promoted in a vigorous and resolute manner, the Provincial Committee decided that the ten key projects would be directly controlled by the Provincial Committee's Technological Innovation Office, and the promotion situation would be reported to the Provincial Committee every three days. For the key projects promoted throughout the province, the "five fixes" (fixed projects, fixed indicators, fixed measures, fixed persons responsible, fixed time to achieve) method was implemented, and tasks were assigned layer by layer from top to bottom, so that the promotion work tasks were implemented to factories and mines to individuals.

Currently, a situation of large-scale summarization, large-scale improvement, and large-scale promotion is forming throughout Hunan Province. The coal-digging ax-type coal mining machine created by Zhou Kai-duan, a worker at Qibaoshan Coal Mine in Qidong County, was quickly promoted and used in coal mines throughout the province. According to statistics from twenty-nine coal mines in Hengyang Prefecture, fifty-three units were rushed out in the first half of April, with one to two units per coal mine. These coal mines are striving to fully realize coal mining mechanization by the end of April. Headed by the Director of the Metallurgical Bureau, Chenzhou Prefecture transferred some cadres, workers, and technicians to various iron plants to impart the experience of large-area and high-yield from Songbai Iron Plant. Within half a month, all iron plants in the district promoted this advanced experience. The average utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces in the district increased from 1.42 in March to 2.2, and the coke ratio decreased from 1.04 in March to 0.92 in April; the ore grade increased by 7% to 12% compared with March. A climax was also set off in various places in promoting coal gasification. Hengyang City organized more than 100 cadres, led by the secretary, and divided them into five groups to go to various factories and enterprises to assist in promoting coal gasification. In three days, 728 coal gas furnaces were built in the city, and 14 units have achieved coal gasification. Employees of the sailing transport sector throughout the province vigorously promoted the advanced experience of "two-boat assistance" to increase carrying capacity. In the first half of April, 6,294 sailboats throughout the province had promoted this advanced experience, which is equivalent to increasing the tonnage of cargo ships by more than 23,000 tons. The advanced experience of the "five-in-one" ring power supply has also been fully promoted in the power departments of Changsha, Changde, Xiangtan, Hengyang and other cities.

In addition to mobilizing employees to summarize, improve, and promote advanced experiences and technologies in their own industries and regions, the Party committees at all levels in Hunan Province also pay close attention to learning and promoting advanced experiences and technologies from other provinces and regions. Since the National Technological Innovation and Technological Revolution Chongqing On-site Conference, the Provincial Committee, based on the specific conditions of Hunan Province, put forward the action slogan of each city learning from Chongqing, catching up with Chongqing, the whole province learning from Sichuan, catching up with Sichuan. In addition to focusing on promoting the advanced experience of the province, the advanced experience brought back from Chongqing was put forward as 18 projects and listed as key promotion projects. Currently, employees throughout the province have set off a competitive upsurge of learning from Chongqing, catching up with Chongqing, learning from Sichuan, catching up with Sichuan, and being the same as Chongqing and Sichuan.

    用最快的速度　有力的措施扩大技术革新成果
    湖南推广三十二项重要经验
    本报长沙9日电　湖南省的技术革新和技术革命运动，已经进入了大抓总结、提高、推广的新阶段。
    湖南省以“四化”为中心的技术革新和技术革命群众运动，据3月底的初步统计，全省职工共提出革新建议三百七十多万条，实现了一百一十四万多条。大量革新建议的实现，大大推动了当前的生产。全省第一季度超额14.1％完成了国家计划，比去年四季度和去年同期分别提高4.4％和14.1％。劳动生产率1月比去年12月增长5.8％，2月份比1月份增长4.2％，3月份又比2月份增长6.2％。
    3月底，中共湖南省委对全省前一段技术革新和技术革命运动，进行了总结和分析，认为在前一段时间内职工群众创造发明很多，而且有许多重大革新创造，有些创造能提高工效很多倍。但是，由于运动刚刚开始，对于这些先进经验的总结、提高、推广，部分单位还未跟上来。省委认为，用最快的速度，采取最有力的措施，将本企业、本地区和外省外地所创造的先进经验、先进技术，因地制宜地在全省各个战线上，各行各业中迅速推广，遍地开花、遍地结果，是十分迫切的问题。省委认为在普及推广过程中，使先进经验和先进技术不断改进提高，不断完善，进一步启发群众智慧，是推动技术革新和技术革命运动不断向前发展的重要方法。因此，省委决定：从4月1日起到4月底止，在发动群众大搞革新创造的同时，突出地抓好先进经验和先进技术的总结、提高、推广工作。而且把这项工作列为进一步推动运动向前继续发展的重要环节。
    为了使先进经验、先进技术迅速地总结起来，加以提高，推广开去，湖南省的做法，首先是从各行各业已有的发明创造中，挑选最重要的重点项目，加以总结。全省在4月份就集中力量，从以下四个方面总结革新经验。第一、以煤为首，大力推广以煤、铁、钢为中心的原材料生产的先进经验和先进技术；第二、交通运输方面，大力推广以提高载运量为主的先进经验和先进技术；第三、基建方面主要是加快施工和设计进度，和提高工程质量；第四、以电为代表，以提高动力出力为主。接着，又以这四个方面为中心，全省确定了三十二项重点推广项目。为了首先解决关键问题，又从这三十二个项目中，确定炼铁方面以推广常宁县松柏铁厂的优质高产经验为主；煤炭生产和节约、综合利用方面，以推广祁东县七宝山煤矿工人周开端创造的挖斧式采煤机、云丰煤矿的土水泵、煤气化为主；炼焦方面，推广快速流水炼焦炉；电力方面，推广“四合一”环形供电；建筑材料生产方面，以推广低标号水泥变高标号水泥；运输方面，推广两船相帮法和汽车拖挂；地质方面推广冶金勘探公司达到千米公司的经验等十个大项目，作为重点推广项目中的重点。省委认为，这些先进经验如果迅速推广，对促进当前生产，有非常重大的意义。
    为了使这些重点项目能雷厉风行地迅速推广开去，省委确定十个重点项目由省委技术革新办公室直接掌握，各地三天向省委汇报一次推广情况。对于在全省推广的重点项目，实行五定（定项目、定指标、定措施、定人负责、定期实现）的办法，由上而下层层下达任务，使推广工作任务落实到厂矿到个人。
    目前，一个大总结、大提高、大推广的局面，正在湖南全省形成。在祁东县七宝山煤矿工人周开端创造的挖斧式采煤机，很快在全省各煤矿推广使用。据衡阳专区二十九个煤矿的统计，在4月份的上半个月中就赶制了五十三台，每个煤矿有一至两台。这些煤矿力争4月底全部实现采煤机械化。郴州专区以冶金局长为首，抽调部分干部、工人和技术人员，分别下到各铁厂传授松柏铁厂大面积高产经验，在半个月的时间内，全区各炼铁厂都推广了这一先进经验，全区小高炉平均利用系数由3月份的一点四二提高到二点二，焦比由3月份的一点零四到4月份下降到零点九二；矿石品位比3月份提高7％至12％。各地推广煤气化方面，也掀起了高潮。衡阳市组织一百多干部，书记挂帅，分成五个组下到各工厂企业协助推广煤气化，全市在三天内就兴建七百二十八座煤气炉，有十四个单位已实现煤气化。全省帆船运输部门的职工，大力推广“两船相帮”提高载运量的先进经验，在4月上半月，全省已有六千二百九十四艘帆船推广了这一先进经验，相当于增加二万三千多吨货运吨位的船只。“五合一”环形供电的先进经验，也在长沙、常德、湘潭、衡阳等市的电业部门全面推广。
    湖南省各级党委，除发动职工总结、提高、推广本行业、本地区的先进经验、先进技术外，还十分注意学习推广外省外地的先进经验和先进技术。自从全国技术革新、技术革命重庆现场会议以后，省委根据湖南省具体情况，提出了各市学重庆、赶重庆，全省学四川、赶四川的行动口号，在重点推广本省先进经验之外，把重庆市带回的先进经验，提出十八个项目列为重点推广项目。目前全省职工已掀起了学重庆、赶重庆、学四川、赶四川，和重庆、四川一个样的竞赛热潮。
