Xinhua News Agency, May 1st. Three million working people in the capital, together with Party and state leaders and international friends from the five continents of the world, held an unprecedentedly broad and enthusiastic rally and parade today to celebrate the "May 1st" International Labor Day.

Party and state leaders Zhu De, Soong Ching Ling, Deng Xiaoping, and Dong Biwu, as well as Peng Zhen, First Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CPC and Mayor of Beijing, all participated in the mass celebrations.

Today, Beijing was a city seething with people. Centered on Tiananmen Square, rallies and parades were held in factories, mines, enterprises, government offices, schools, and rural people's communes throughout the city. Party leaders, advanced figures from the masses, and invited foreign guests delivered speeches celebrating the festival at many rallies.

The spacious Tiananmen Square was today dressed in traditional festive attire. A huge portrait of Chairman Mao Zedong hung in the center of the Tiananmen Gate, with giant statues of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin erected on both sides opposite. As the morning sun shone golden on the Tiananmen Gate, the magnificent music of "Ode to the Motherland" was broadcast from the loudspeakers. Groups of marchers composed of workers, cadres, students, militiamen, members of urban people's communes, and athletes, like a hundred rivers flowing into the sea, surged towards Tiananmen Square simultaneously along East and West Chang'an Avenue and Qianmen Street. The enthusiastic marchers waved colorful flags as they advanced. The sound of tsunami-like slogans, deafening gongs and drums, and strings of firecrackers intertwined. The marchers shouted: "Celebrate the 'May 1st' International Labor Day!" "Long live the great unity of the people of the world!" "Long live Marxism-Leninism!" "Long live the unity of the Socialist camp led by the Soviet Union!" "People of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, unite and overthrow imperialism!"

At this time, trade union delegations from Asia, Africa, Latin America, Europe, and Australia arrived at the square. Wherever they went, thunderous applause erupted. Members of the Cuban and Brazilian trade union delegations joined the workers' parade, waving bouquets presented to them by the marchers, and repeatedly and rhythmically cheering: "Mao Zedong! Mao Zedong!" "Cuba - Brazil - China!" "Brothers," "Friendship," "Peace." They passed through dense crowds to the dance circles, where countless enthusiastic hands reached out, and people jumped and waved colorful flags and bouquets at them. Representatives and young people from the trade union delegations of Algeria, Congo, and the Federation of Mali sang and danced folk dances to the rhythm of applause. People around them shouted: "Resolutely support the national democratic movements of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America!" "Oppose U.S. imperialism's intensified arms expansion and war preparations!" "Long live the great unity of the working class of the world!" The foreign guests could not help but raise their hands and shout in Chinese: "Long live! Long live! Long live!"

Today, on many occasions, Party and state leaders cordially celebrated the festival with the masses. Chairman Zhu De warmly shook hands with workers in the dense crowds of Zhongshan Park and congratulated the working people on the festival. Chairman Zhu and workers, students, doctors, and people from all walks of life, as well as guests from many countries, watched the literary and artistic performances here. Vice-Chairman Soong Ching Ling celebrated the festival with the masses at the Workers' Stadium and Jingshan Park. At Jingshan Park, Vice-Chairman Soong watched the children's performances and visited the children's works of art, crafts, and other works exhibited in the Children's Palace. Young Pioneers presented Vice-Chairman Soong with collectively created velvet chickens and yarn-knitted schoolbags as small May Day gifts. Vice-Chairman Dong Biwu and Vice-Chairman Lin Boqu celebrated May Day with the masses in Beihai Park. Tens of thousands of people held a variety of celebration activities here. Party and state leaders Deng Xiaoping, Peng Zhen, Li Fuchun, He Long, Liu Lantao, as well as Cai Chang, Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, and Liu Ren, Second Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CPC, successively went to mass gathering places such as the Workers' Stadium, Beihai Park, Jingshan Park, Zhongshan Park, and the Working People's Cultural Palace to celebrate the festival with the masses. They had cordial conversations with many people.

In addition to participating in mass rallies, some Party and state leaders also led parades. In the parade of cadres from the State Council, Vice-Premier Xi Zhongxun walked in the front. Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Guo Moruo led the parade of scientific workers in Zhongguancun, Haidian District. Walking at the front of this team were many scientists such as Qian Sanqiang, Qian Xuesen, and Hua Luogeng. They held bouquets and cheered "Long live the General Line!" "Long live the Great Leap Forward!" "Long live the People's Communes!" Qian Sanqiang happily said: When we paraded on May Day in 1952, we had only a few hundred people, but now our team is like a giant dragon. Guo Moruo added: "Our scientific team is growing stronger day by day."

Party and state leaders and responsible persons from various fields who celebrated the festival with the masses today also included: Luo Ronghuan, Tan Zhenlin, Kang Sheng, Bo Yibo, Hu Qiaomu, Luo Ruiqing, Shen Junru, Huang Yanpei, Chen Shutong, Cheng Qian, Bao Erhan, Zhang Zhizhong, and Zhang Dingcheng.

Also celebrating the festival with the masses were Liu Ren, Second Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CPC, Secretariat Secretaries Wan Li, Chen Peng, Fan Rusheng, and Chen Kehan, and Vice-Mayors of Beijing Feng Jiping, Wu Han, Wang Kunlun, Cheng Hongyi, Jia Tingsan, and Yue Songsheng.

The envoys of the heroic people at the forefront of the anti-imperialist struggle in Africa - Vice-Premier Krim Belkacem and all the distinguished guests of the Provisional Government Delegation of the Republic of Algeria led by him - joined the people of the capital this morning to celebrate "May 1st" International Labor Day.

The liberated Chinese people have a particularly deep feeling for the Algerian military and civilians who insist on using armed resistance against the French colonial army. Wherever Vice-Premier Krim Belkacem and other distinguished guests went, whether to factories, in front of Tiananmen, or to Beihai Park, the people celebrating the festival, including workers, students, women, soldiers, and "Red Scarves," immediately gathered around and applauded warmly. When the distinguished guests arrived at the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, the assembled employees and armed militiamen all raised their arms and shouted: "Resolutely support the just struggle of the Algerian people!" "Salute the Algerian military and civilians who are heroically resisting!"

Vice-Premier Krim Belkacem spoke to the employees with excitement, and he said enthusiastically: "Thank you for your warm welcome, thank you to the great and friendly Chinese people, thank you!" His words aroused prolonged and enthusiastic applause among the employees.

Accompanied by Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs Ji Pengfei and others, the distinguished guests, after enjoying the literary and artistic and sports performances of the factory employees and visiting the workshops, Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs Francis Ahmed spoke on behalf of the Provisional Government Delegation of the Republic of Algeria. He told the employees that the people of Algeria could not celebrate today's festival in this way because they are now fighting for freedom and independence. He also said in a firm tone: "After visiting here, we strongly feel that we must fight until final liberation. China's liberation and construction are our example." He finally shouted "Long live the Chinese working people!" "Long live freedom and independence!"

Blas Roca, General Secretary of the People's Socialist Party of Cuba, and his wife, accompanied by Wu Xiuquan, member of the Central Committee of the CPC, and his wife, met with the working people of Beijing in Beihai Park and Zhongshan Park, and were warmly welcomed. Roca told reporters that everywhere we go, we see the happy mood of the Chinese people who are building a new life, and we see the great Chinese people's concern for Cuba and their enthusiastic support for the Cuban revolution, which makes me very moved and feels like being at home. Although Cuba is geographically quite far from China, the people of the two countries are connected by a common will: We want to move the revolution forward, we want to defend peace, and the enemies of our two peoples' revolution and world peace are all imperialism.

Forty-four trade union delegations from forty-one countries and regions on five continents celebrated the festival with Beijing workers and other working people, and wherever they went, there was an atmosphere of great unity among the working people of the world. In the morning, trade union delegations from eleven socialist countries and twenty-eight trade union delegations from Asia, Africa, and Latin America, accompanied by Liu Ningyi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and others, went to the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant and the Beijing State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 to participate in the celebration rallies held by the workers of these factories. At the celebration rally attended by more than 6,000 employees of the No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, Zhao Cheng, Secretary of the Party Committee of the plant, warmly welcomed the trade union delegations from socialist countries. He stated that the Chinese working class and other working people are determined to work hard to strengthen the unbreakable friendship and unity with the people of socialist countries, and are determined to work hard to safeguard world peace and the socialist cause.

K. V. Rusakov, head of the Soviet trade union delegation, said at the meeting that the Soviet people are doing everything possible to defend peace. He congratulated the Communist Party of China, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, on the great achievements made in inspiring and organizing the people to carry out the political revolution and build the socialist cause. He hopes that the Chinese people will achieve new victories in their future work, in realizing the great plan to build a new and happy life, and in the struggle to defend peace. His speech won warm applause from the audience. The workers in the audience shouted: "Long live the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!"

At the grand celebration rally jointly held by the Beijing No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 Cotton Textile Plants, representatives from the trade union delegations of Cuba, Algeria, Iraq, Congo, Japan, Chile, and other countries, as well as women representatives from Cuba and Paraguay, all delivered enthusiastic speeches, which were warmly welcomed by more than 15,000 workers from the three factories.

At the meeting, Tian Yuan, Secretary of the Party Committee of the Beijing No. 3 Cotton Textile Plant, first delivered a welcome speech. He congratulated the unprecedented development of the national liberation movements of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against imperialism and colonialism, and expressed that the Chinese people firmly support their just struggle.

Fares Ben Mehal, head of the delegation of the General Union of Algerian Workers from fighting Algeria, said that the Algerian people and workers are taking up arms and using all means to launch an anti-colonialist struggle. Neither the armed intervention nor the political conspiracies of French colonialism can prevent Algeria from becoming an independent and free country.

Edward Valentine Moundonbo, head of the delegation of the National Confederation of Congolese Workers, said that Congo will soon be independent on June 30 this year, and we will have freedom of thought and action. He said passionately that the clock in history to end colonialism has struck! We can say unequivocally: This is colonialism and imperialism to get out of Africa, and African countries to gain national sovereignty.

Shinji Hagiwara, head of the delegation of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan visiting China, said in his speech that the Japanese working class is currently fighting against the military alliance that is hostile to China in the name of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." U.S. imperialism and Nobusuke Kishi, ignoring the fierce criticism of the peace-loving people of Asia and the world, are attempting to forcefully promote an aggressive war policy. This is trampling on the wishes of the Japanese people. He said that Chinese workers and Japanese workers have shaken hands on the basis of class solidarity. This handshake cannot be severed by any persecution.

Ali Shukr, head of the Iraqi trade union delegation, said that after the Iraqi people gained national independence, imperialism and its running dogs launched five conspiracies in an attempt to usurp the fruits of our victory and strangle our republic, but the heroic Iraqi people and their conscious vanguard—the working class—know how to deal with imperialism and its running dogs. Imperialism will never win, it will only be battered and bruised in the face of the powerful and united strength of the people.

Jose Bayon Hahn, a representative of the Cuban Workers' Federation delegation, conveyed the warm congratulations of the Cuban workers to the Chinese workers in his speech. He said that although China and Cuba are far apart geographically, we are actually very close. We are united in the same goal, and we have common enemies. He shouted: Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Cuban people! Long live the unity of Latin America ! Long live the great unity of the working class of the world!

Maria Nunez, head of the Cuban women's delegation, said that Cuba has exchanged its liberation at the expensive price of sacrificing twenty thousand people. Now the Cuban people are standing up more and more firmly. We are confident that friendship and solidarity will make their revolution, which is being carried out victoriously, invincible.

Carmen Soler, a Paraguayan woman representative, said that the purpose of the struggle of the Latin American people is exactly the purpose for which the Chinese people once bravely sacrificed for. Now, the Paraguayan people are carrying out a guerrilla struggle, and they often say: We will never tolerate exploiters, we will never submit to exploiters, we will never allow imperialist intervention, and we will never allow imperialism to launch new wars.

Bras Celestino Podugal Dunako, head of the Chilean Unified Workers' Union delegation, also spoke at the meeting. He said that the Chilean workers warmly wish the class brothers of the world to continue to achieve success in their struggles, and are willing to maintain our fraternal friendship and mutual support forever in our joint actions.

The speeches of the foreign guests were constantly interrupted by cheers from all the workers. Afterwards, the reporting team composed of more than 1,000 advanced producers and red flag bearers from the three cotton textile plants reported the latest production achievements to the conference. The trade union representatives from various countries warmly applauded and congratulated them.

After participating in the celebration meeting, the trade union delegations from various countries went to the Working People's Cultural Palace and Tiananmen Square to join the masses in a get-together. As soon as the Soviet trade union delegation entered the gate of the Working People's Cultural Palace, they took a group photo with the workers of the Beijing Steel Plant in front of the flower beds. When they met with a group of young female workers from light industrial enterprises, they immediately had a cordial conversation. K. V. Rusakov, head of the delegation, praised the achievements of the Chinese people's construction, and the girls pointed out: This is inseparable from the help of the Soviet big brother. K. V. Rusakov emphasized: "The strength of the people of our two countries combined, we are not afraid of anyone!"

The delegation of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan visiting China, headed by delegation leader Shinji Hagiwara, had a get-together with the workers in the Working People's Cultural Palace, and also gave the workers commemorative badges of "Sino-Japanese Friendship" and "Oppose the Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty'". They excitedly stepped onto the stage performed by the mechanical workers, and sang "May Day Labor Song" and "National Independence Action Team Song" hand in hand, which was warmly welcomed by the workers. In the "May Day Labor Song", they sang: "Listen, the voice of the working class of the world, the voice of demonstrations against autocratic despots, is the voice symbolizing the bright future...". These two songs are often sung by Japanese workers in gatherings and fighting against the U.S.-Japan reactionaries.

International friends from North Korea, Algeria, and Somaliland celebrated "May 1st" International Labor Day with the employees of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company today. They all spoke at the celebration meeting. These foreign guests from Asia and Africa unanimously expressed the enthusiasm of Asian and African people for unity and friendship, and emphasized that Asian and African people should unite and resolutely oppose imperialism and colonialism. Their speeches repeatedly won stormy applause.

Ko Seong-chun, head of the North Korean Central News Agency delegation visiting China, said in his speech: While the great Chinese people are setting off a vigorous Great Leap Forward, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has also stepped on the double-headed Chollima. He said that as our socialist camp gets better day by day, the enemy is rotting day by day. The people of South Korea have driven Syngman Rhee, who was supported by U.S. imperialism with guns, off the stage. But, he said, the struggle is not over, but only beginning. U.S. imperialism is our common enemy. If the people of North Korea and China persist in the struggle, we will surely drive U.S. imperialism out of South Korea and Taiwan.

Today, representatives of employees from all walks of life—workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers—of the Shijingshan Sino-Soviet Friendship People's Commune gathered here to celebrate "May 1st."

At this celebration meeting, Habib, Chairman of the Democratic Union of French Somaliland and former Prime Minister, was also invited to speak. He said, I come from Africa, and I would like to convey to you the sincere congratulations of the African people, especially the people of Somaliland. Our country has been oppressed by imperialism for a long time, and we demand freedom and independence. He emphasized that we must end imperialism's rule on our country's land in 1960, and we cannot let imperialism continue to stay in Africa! The people present applauded Habib's words with a storm of applause, expressing their firm support.

When Habib talked with Liu Mengyun, Deputy Manager of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, he said that the imperialists sent troops to our country to force our people to work hard for them, and they also said that this is called democracy. The imperialists say that we are not capable of managing our own country. Habib said that China has shown strength to imperialism and set an example for us. We believe that our people can better manage the affairs of their own country than the imperialists.

The entire members of the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association delegation visiting China led by Masuzo Akatsu and Japanese journalists Takeo Ito and others participated in the celebration activities of the teachers and students of Peking University. They watched a skit reflecting the South Korean people's opposition to the U.S.-Rhee group compiled by the students themselves, and at the invitation of the students, they sang the Japanese song "Tokyo-Beijing" together, and the students also sang this song in Japanese. At this celebration meeting full of friendly atmosphere, delegation leader Masuzo Akatsu said in his speech that under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have achieved the victory of the Chinese revolution and realized the Great Leap Forward of socialist construction, which is a huge inspiration to the people of countries who are fighting for peace, democracy, and independence. The Chinese people's spirit of resolutely fighting against U.S. imperialism has set a brilliant example for the people of colonies and semi-colonies. Now in Japan, the broad masses of people with the working class as the core are carrying out an unprecedented large-scale struggle to oppose the U.S.-Japan military aggression alliance and the reactionary rule of Nobusuke Kishi. He said, we believe that victory must belong to us!

At the celebration meeting of the Renmin University of China, Argentine cultural delegation member and famous lawyer Alfaro was invited to speak amidst warm applause. He said that the revolutionary struggle carried out by the Chinese people proves that imperialism is not terrible. The current task of our Argentine people is to fight against the dictatorial regime. The example of revolutionary Cuba has once again enlightened us on how we should fight.

Wu Yuzhang, President of Renmin University of China, spoke at the meeting. He said that we, together with the people of the whole country and the people of the world, warmly celebrate the festival of the working people of the world. On this year's "May 1st" Festival, we are facing an unprecedentedly good situation, and the road of the imperialist bloc is getting narrower and narrower. We firmly support the national liberation movements of the peoples of Asian, African, and Latin American colonies and semi-colonies.

A youth delegation from Cameroon and youth representatives from Congo celebrated the festival with teachers and students of 47 ethnic minorities at the Central University for Nationalities. Amidst the warm applause of the teachers and students, the guests spoke enthusiastically at the meeting.

On the shore of Kunming Lake in the Summer Palace, more than 30 Korean students from Peking University were warmly welcomed by the capital's university students. Zhang Zhongxing, Secretary of the Fourth Grade Party Branch of the Department of Mechanical Engineering of Tsinghua University, said to them on behalf of the entire class: "We pay the highest respect to the heroic and unyielding South Korean students, and we firmly support your struggle. Your victory is our victory." At this time, the surrounding crowd shouted: Support the patriotic and just struggle of the South Korean people! Long live the great unity of the Chinese and North Korean people! Chinese and Korean college students also sang "General Kim Il-sung's Song" and "The East is Red" together, and performed many programs for each other.

Today, in various activities celebrating the festival, the working people of the capital celebrated the great victory of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, and expressed their determination to continue the leap forward after the meeting. The workers of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company held a rally and parade of 100,000 people together with the nearby masses. After the workers of No. 3 blast furnace overfulfilled the first shift's production plan for today, they joined the parade excitedly without taking off their work clothes. Since the beginning of this year, they have realized thirteen major technological innovations, which have made the utilization coefficient of the blast furnace increase sharply from 1.311 at the beginning of the year to 1.865. The miners of Jingxi Coal Mine paraded and gathered near six mine shafts respectively. In Changxindian, which has a glorious revolutionary tradition, at Fengtai Station, an important hub of railway transportation in the country, and in the vast area where factories are lined up in the eastern suburbs of Beijing, the workers' parade队伍川流不息。

Many streets and alleys that used to be quiet on "May 1st" have become the most lively places today. Half a street of Erlong Road in Xicheng District was turned into an open-air venue, where more than 2,000 commune members held a rally. The commune members of the People's Commune near Longxugou in Chongwen District celebrated the festival in the green grass of Tiantan Park. The Beixinqiao People's Commune in Dongcheng District, with tens of thousands of residents forming a mighty parade, people constantly shouted: "Long live the General Line!" "Long live the Great Leap Forward!" "Long live the Urban and Rural People's Communes!" "Long live Chairman Mao!", in addition, more than 4,000 people held a celebration meeting. A gift team composed of 150 advanced producers and red flag bearers carried various new products and chart models. The song "Socialism is Good" resounded throughout the venue. Production personnel of commune-run factories, nursery staff, and cooks successively performed various literary and artistic programs they compiled themselves.

In the towns, villages, and reservoir construction sites in the suburbs, farmers also happily celebrated their festival. The masses in Tongxian paraded on a street as long as four miles. In front of the Miyun Reservoir dam, nearly 100,000 laborers held grand rallies respectively. The members of the Sino-German Friendship People's Commune in Chaoyang District paraded in neat lines, with professional teams such as wheat, vegetables, and animal husbandry and commune-run factories as units. The commune members constantly shouted: "Consolidate and develop the rural People's Communes!" "Strive to realize the Twelve-Year National Agricultural Development Program two or three years ahead of schedule!"

On the two tree-lined avenues leading to the Summer Palace, which are more than ten kilometers long, the parade teams of universities and colleges were connected from beginning to end. The parading teachers and students raised their arms and shouted along the way: "Implement the policy of education serving the politics of the working class and combining education with productive labor!" "The whole people run education, implement the great revolution of education!" The People's Liberation Army units stationed in Beijing held celebration rallies in their respective garrisons. In their speeches, the leaders of various units pointed out the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism of false peace and true preparation for war. The officers and soldiers expressed their determination to liberate Taiwan. Militiamen from many units also joined the rallies and parades in formation.

Foreign guests from more than 60 countries and regions who visited China, diplomatic envoys and diplomatic officials from various countries stationed in China, Soviet and other experts from various countries who helped China with its construction, and foreign students and interns participated in various celebration activities.

Representatives from various provinces and regions attending the militia representative meeting, visiting groups from ethnic minorities from Inner Mongolia, Tibet, Guangxi, Sichuan, Guizhou, etc., overseas Chinese visiting groups from more than 20 countries and regions in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Australia, and overseas Chinese representatives also participated in the celebration activities with the people of the capital today.

Hundreds of parks, theaters, and sports venues throughout the city were full of people celebrating the festival. Famous actors from more than ten types of operas, such as Mei Lanfang, Yu Zhenfei, Hong Xiannv, Ma Shizeng, Yuan Xuefen, and Chen Bohua, performed and sang their signature operas on the same stage in Zhongshan Park. Aquatic music concerts and folk art performances were held in Taoranting, Beihai, and other places. More workers, cadres, and students formed circles, performing and singing by themselves. 100,000 people watched football and various sports performances in the Beijing Workers' Stadium. A martial arts team composed of children as young as seven years old and white-haired old people performed swords, spears, and sabers in the Beihai Stadium. The Taiyang Palace Stadium by Longtan Lake and the Summer Palace and Guanyuan Stadium and other places became the center of national defense sports performances and competitions. Radio-controlled aircraft model performances, glider performances, sampans, motorboats, and motorcycle competitions were held simultaneously in the air, on the water, and on land. In other sports venues, people saw the wonderful performances of outstanding national basketball, football, volleyball, and gymnastics players. In the bicycle performance race in 13 provinces and cities, Sun Shihai, Hao Rudian, and Yu Shengtao from the "August 1st" team and Qu Xipu, a car worker from Harbin, broke the national record in the one-kilometer bicycle race.

Soon after the unprecedented large-scale parade and celebration activities throughout the city ended, people celebrating the festival once again gathered from all directions to Tiananmen Square and other activity venues to participate in the grand festival evening party tonight.

    宽阔的天安门广场今天披上了传统的节日盛装。天安门城楼正中悬挂着毛泽东主席的巨幅画像，对面两侧分别矗立着马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的巨像。当早晨的太阳把天安门城楼照得金光灿烂的时候，扩音器里播送出“歌唱祖国”的雄壮乐曲。一群群由工人、干部、学生、民兵、城市人民公社社员和运动员组成的游行队伍，好似百川汇流一样，沿着东西长安街和前门大街，同时涌向天安门广场。热情奔放的游行群众，不停地挥着彩旗行进。海啸般的口号声，震天的锣鼓声，连珠的鞭炮声，交织在一起。游行者高呼：“庆祝‘五一’国际劳动节！”“全世界人民大团结万岁！”“马克思列宁主义万岁！”“以苏联为首的社会主义阵营团结万岁！”“亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的人民联合起来，打倒帝国主义！”

    解放了的中国人民对坚持以武装抗击法国殖民军队的阿尔及利亚军民，怀有特别深厚的感情。克里姆·贝勒卡塞姆副总理等贵宾，不论到工厂、天安门前或是到北海公园，那里欢度节日的人们，包括工人、学生、妇女、军人和“红领巾”们，都立刻围拢上来，热烈鼓掌。贵宾们来到北京第一机床厂的时候，聚会的职工们、武装的民兵们，都振臂高呼：“坚决支持阿尔及利亚人民的正义斗争！”“向英勇抗战的阿尔及利亚军民致敬！”

    古巴人民社会党总书记布拉斯·罗加和他的夫人，由中共中央委员伍修权和他的夫人陪同，在北海公园和中山公园会见了北京市的劳动人民，受到热烈的欢迎。罗加对记者说，我们每到一地，都看到正在建设新生活的中国人民的快乐心情，看到伟大的中国人民那样关心古巴，热情地支持古巴革命，使我很受感动，感到像在家里一样。古巴虽然在地理上距离中国相当遥远，可是两国人民却被共同的意志连接在一起：我们要使革命向前发展，要保卫和平，我们两国人民革命和世界和平的敌人，都是帝国主义。
    来自五大洲四十一个国家和地区的四十四个工会代表团和北京工人及其他劳动人民在一起欢度了节日，他们所到之处，洋溢着全世界劳动人民大团结的情谊。上午，十一个社会主义国家的工会代表团和二十八个亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的工会代表团，分别由中华全国总工会主席刘宁一等陪同，到北京第一机床厂和北京国棉一厂、二厂、三厂，参加这些工厂工人举行的庆祝大会。在第一机床厂六千多名职工参加的庆祝大会上，这个厂的中共党委书记赵澄对社会主义各国工会代表团表示热烈欢迎。他表示中国工人阶级和其他劳动人民坚决为加强同社会主义各国人民的牢不可破的友谊和团结而努力，坚决为维护世界和平和社会主义事业而努力。

    日本工会总评议会访华代表团团长萩原信治在发言中说，当前日本工人阶级正在反对以日美“安全条约”为名的敌视中国的军事同盟而斗争。美帝国主义和岸信介，不顾亚洲和全世界爱好和平人民的激烈抨击，企图强力推行侵略的战争政策。这是蹂躏日本国民的愿望的。他说，中国工人和日本工人已在阶级团结的基础上握起手来了。这个握手是任何迫害所不能切断的。
    伊拉克工会代表团团长阿里·舒克尔说，伊拉克人民获得民族独立后，帝国主义及其走狗策动了五次阴谋，企图篡夺我们的胜利果实，扼杀我们的共和国，但是英勇的伊拉克人民和他们有觉悟的先锋队——工人阶级，知道怎样来对付帝国主义及其走狗。帝国主义决不会胜利，只会在强大的人民团结一致的力量面前碰得头破血流。
    古巴工人联合会代表团代表何塞·伯雍·哈恩在发言中转达了古巴工人对中国工人的热烈祝贺。他说，中国和古巴两国，在地理上虽然相隔很远，但是我们实际上靠得很近。我们团结在同一的目标里，我们有共同的敌人。他高呼：中国—古巴人民友谊万岁！拉丁美洲团结万岁！全世界工人阶级大团结万岁！
    古巴妇女代表团团长玛丽亚·努?斯讲话说，古巴是以两万个人牺牲的昂贵代价换取了自己的解放。现在古巴人民越来越坚定地站起来了。我们确信友谊和团结会使他们正在胜利进行着的革命成为不可战胜。
    巴拉圭妇女代表卡门·索勒尔说，拉丁美洲人民的斗争目的，正是中国人民曾经英勇牺牲为之奋斗过的目的。现在，巴拉圭人民正在进行游击斗争，他们常说：我们绝不容忍剥削者，绝不屈服于剥削者，绝不允许帝国主义干涉，绝不允许帝国主义发动新的战争。
    智利工人统一工会代表团团长布拉斯·赛勒斯蒂诺·波杜加尔·杜纳哥也在会上讲了话。他说，智利劳动者热烈祝愿全世界阶级弟兄的斗争不断取得成就，并愿在我们的共同行动中，永远保持我们兄弟般的友谊和互相支援。

    各国工会代表团参加了庆祝大会以后，又到劳动人民文化宫和天安门广场同群众联欢。苏联工会代表团一走进劳动人民文化宫的大门，就同北京钢厂的工人们在花坛前合影留念。当他们和一群轻工业企业的青年女工会面时，立即亲切地交谈起来。代表团团长?罗诺夫赞扬了中国人民建设的成就，姑娘们指出：这是和苏联老大哥的帮助分不开的。?罗诺夫强调说：“我们两国人民的力量加在一起，就谁也不怕！”
    以团长萩原信治为首的日本工会总评议会访华代表团，在劳动人民文化宫和工人们一起联欢，还给工人们赠送“日中友好”、“反对日美‘安全条约’”纪念章。他们兴奋地登上机械工人演出的舞台，手挽手地高唱“五一劳动节之歌”和“民族独立行动队之歌”，受到工人的热烈欢迎。在“五一劳动节之歌”中他们唱道：“听，万国工人阶级的声音，对独裁的专制者示威游行的声音，就是象征着光明未来的声音……”。这两支歌是日本工人群众集会，向美日反动派进行斗争时经常唱的。
    来自朝鲜、阿尔及利亚和索马里兰的国际友人，今天和石景山钢铁公司的职工们一起，庆祝“五一”国际劳动节。他们都在庆祝会上讲了话。这些亚非地区的外宾一致表达了亚非人民团结友好的热情，强调亚非人民要团结起来，坚决反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义。他们的讲话，一再博得暴风雨般的掌声。
    朝鲜中央通讯社访华代表团团长高成淳在讲话中说：在伟大的中国人民掀起轰轰烈烈大跃进的同时，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国也跨上了双头千里马。他说，在我们社会主义阵营一天天好起来的时候，敌人正在一天天烂下去。南朝鲜的人民，已经把美帝国主义用枪杆子支持的李承晚赶下了台。但是，他说，斗争并没有结束，而只是开始，美帝国主义是我们的共同敌人，我们朝中两国人民坚持斗争，一定能把美帝国主义从南朝鲜和台湾赶出去。
    今天在这里集会庆祝“五一”的，有石景山中苏友好人民公社的工、农、商、学、兵各条战线上的社员代表。
    在这个庆祝会上，法属非洲索马里兰民主联盟主席、前总理哈比也应邀讲了话，他说，我来自非洲，我向你们转达非洲人民，特别是索马里兰人民的诚恳的祝贺。我们的国家受帝国主义的压迫很久，我们要求得到自由和独立。他强调说，我们要在1960年结束帝国主义在我国土地上的统治，我们也不能让帝国主义再在非洲继续呆下去！到会群众对哈比的这些话，报以暴风雨般的掌声，表示坚决支持。
    哈比在同石景山钢铁公司副经理刘孟云交谈时说，帝国主义派军队到我们国家强迫我们的人民为他们做苦工，他们还说这叫做民主。帝国主义者说我们没有能力管理自己的国家。哈比说，中国对帝国主义显示了力量，给我们做出了榜样。我们相信，我们的人民比帝国主义者能够更好地管理自己国家的事务。
    由赤津益造率领的日中友好协会访华代表团全体团员和日本新闻界人士伊藤武雄等参加了北京大学师生的庆祝活动。他们观看了学生自编的反映南朝鲜人民反对美李集团的活报剧，并应同学们的邀请合唱了日本歌曲“东京—北京”，学生们也用日语唱了这首歌。在这个充满友好气氛的庆祝会上，赤津益造团长发表讲话说，中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的英明领导下，取得了中国革命的胜利，实现了社会主义建设的大跃进，这是对正在为争取和平、民主、独立而斗争的国家的人民的巨大鼓舞。中国人民向美帝国主义坚决作斗争的精神，给殖民地半殖民地人民作出了光辉的榜样。现在在日本，以工人阶级为核心的广大的人民群众，为了反对日美军事侵略同盟和岸信介的反动统治，正在进行着空前未有的大规模的斗争。他说，我们相信胜利一定属于我们！
    在中国人民大学的庆祝大会上，阿根廷文化代表团团员、著名律师阿尔法罗，在热烈掌声中应邀讲话。他说，中国人民进行的革命斗争，证明了帝国主义是不可怕的。我们阿根廷人民当前的任务，就是为反对独裁政权而进行斗争。革命的古巴的例子，再一次启示了我们应该如何进行斗争。
    中国人民大学校长吴玉章在会上讲了话。他说，我们和全国人民全世界人民一起，热烈庆祝全世界劳动人民的节日。今年的“五一”节，我们面临着空前未有的大好形势，帝国主义集团的路已经越来越窄了。我们坚决支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲殖民地半殖民地人民的民族解放运动。
