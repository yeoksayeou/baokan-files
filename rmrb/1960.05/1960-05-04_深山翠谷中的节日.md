    Festival in the Deep Mountain Valley
    Gao Fangquan, Jiang Qing
    In the deep mountain valleys of a certain place in Guangdong, four companies of the famous "Tashan Defense Hero Regiment" are stationed. Two of them won the honorary titles of "Changling Company" and "Changlun Company" in the war; two were rated as "Shooting Pacesetters" and Communist Youth League branch pacesetters in the Guangzhou area troops during training. On the eve of May Day, they held a celebration meeting in the jungle and carried out enthusiastic celebration activities. At the beginning of the celebration meeting, Deputy Regiment Commander Cheng Yuanmao, a major, arrived. He is a representative of the National People's Congress and recently returned from a meeting in Beijing. He kindly introduced to the soldiers the achievements of socialist construction in the capital and across the country, and the grand occasion of the National People's Congress.
    At the meeting, the officers and soldiers of each company presented their new achievements to the regiment leaders and fraternal companies as gifts. Since April, the first training results of the shooting pacesetter company have achieved "excellent" in various weapons, and many people have achieved "full marks." After the "Changling Company" issued a call to greet May Day with the spirit of the Changling battle, they broke through the highest work efficiency this year on the construction site, exceeding the quota set by the higher authorities by 56%. At the meeting, the commanders and fighters expressed that they would learn from each other and continue to create better results.
    At night, the deep mountain valley was misty with rain, but the club was brightly lit, and the officers and soldiers were enjoying themselves together. Yang Yanlin and Huang Shenfa, soldiers of the "Changlun Company," sang Hakka folk songs, and Deputy Company Commander Ling Shen and Second Lieutenant performed a song "The People's Commune is Happy and Long." The officers and soldiers enjoyed the party until late at night.

    深山翠谷中的节日
    高方全　江清
    广东某地的深山翠谷间，驻守着著名的“塔山守备英雄团”的四个连队。两个在战争中获得过“长岭连”和“常伦连”的英雄称号；两个在训练中被评为广州地区部队“射击标兵”和共青团支部标兵。“五一”前夕，他们在丛林里举行了庆祝大会，开展了热烈的庆祝活动。庆祝大会开始时，副团长程远茂少校赶来了。他是全国人民代表大会代表，最近刚从北京开会回来。他亲切地向士兵们介绍了首都和全国各地社会主义建设的成就，人民代表大会的盛况。
    各连官兵在会上以自己的新成绩向团首长和兄弟连队献礼。4月以来，射击标兵连的第一练习成绩又取得了各种武器“优秀”，许多人实现了“满堂红”。“长岭连”发出以长岭战斗精神迎接“五一”的号召以后，他们在工地上一举突破了今年以来的最高工效，超过上级定额规定的56％。会上，指战员们都表示要互相学习，继续创造更好的成绩。
    夜晚，深山翠谷中雨雾蒙蒙，俱乐部里却灯光雪亮，官兵们在同欢共乐。“常伦连”的战士杨雁林和黄深发唱了客家民歌，副连长凌申和少尉演出了一曲“人民公社幸福长”。官兵们联欢一直到深夜。
