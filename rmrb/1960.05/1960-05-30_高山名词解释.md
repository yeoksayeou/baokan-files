Explanation of Alpine Terms

	Glacier: In high mountain areas and high latitude zones, due to the particularly cold climate, snow falling on the ground does not easily melt. Loose snowflakes gradually condense into granular snow due to pressure. As the amount of snow increases, in areas with thick snow cover, the granular snow at the bottom gradually turns into dense ice layers. After the ice layer accumulates to a certain thickness, it generates energy, causing the ice layer to move slowly from high to low. This movement of the "water body" in a solid state is similar to the movement of a "water body" in a liquid state in a river channel, so it is called a glacier or ice river.
	Icefield: This is an area where ice and snow accumulate, referring to originally rugged ground that has been leveled by massive amounts of ice and snow, forming a very flat ice and snow surface. It is the source of supply for glaciers.
	Ice Tower: This refers to a pointed conical ice body, wider at the bottom and narrower at the top, that has not yet melted during the ablation process of a glacier. They vary in height, some reaching up to about 40 meters. This is a unique "sculpture" of ice in the glaciers of Mount Everest, extending for several kilometers in "groups," creating a spectacular sight.
	Ice Lake: In ice and snow-covered areas, due to the uneven structure of the ice and snow itself, ablation is also unequal. In areas where ice and snow melt more and faster, depressions often form, and ice lakes are formed after water accumulates.
	Ice Wall: This refers to a huge ice surface or ice body that has not completely melted and stands upright like a wall.
	Cirque: When a glacier retreats to its final stage, a circular depression often appears beside the peak, with a gap in the front, resembling a funnel. This depression is called a cirque. It is formed by the glacier "digging" away massive amounts of accumulated rock during its flow, and some are as deep as one or two hundred meters.
	Ice Tongue: This refers to the front end of a glacier or the ice flow that emerges from the gap in front of a cirque, usually tongue-shaped, hence the name ice tongue. In summer, when the ice in the glacier riverbed melts, water flows out from this point.
	Moraine: The materials "transported" and "deposited" during glacier movement are collectively called moraine (or moraine stone). Its shape and the content of its accumulation often vary depending on the location of deposition. Moraine at the bottom of the glacier is called ground moraine; moraine on both sides of the glacier is called lateral moraine; moraine at the front of the glacier is called terminal moraine (or end moraine, front moraine, final moraine). Moraines are mostly composed of sticky mud and gravel, mixed without stratification, and the gravel is mostly angular.
	Ice Mushroom: Large rocks deposited on top of a glacier often prevent sunlight from directly shining on the ice beneath them. Therefore, the ice under the rock, due to the cover of the rock, often does not melt and becomes an isolated ice pillar, supporting a huge rock, resembling a mushroom, commonly called an ice mushroom.

    高山名词解释
    冰川：高山地区和高纬度地带，由于气候特别寒冷，降落在地面上的雪不易融化，疏松的雪花因为压力关系，逐渐凝成粒状的粒雪。随着雪量的增加，在雪厚的地区，底部的粒雪逐渐变成微密的冰层。冰层积累到
  一定的厚度以后，就产生能量，使冰层由高处缓慢向低处移动。这种固体状态的“水体”的移动，就仿佛液体状态“水体”在河槽中运动一样，因此把它叫做冰川或称冰河。
    冰原：它是冰雪的积累地区，即指原来崎岖不平的地面上，被巨量的冰雪填平以后，表面形成非常平坦的冰雪地面。它是冰川的供给源泉。
    冰塔：是指冰川在消融的过程中，尚未融解的上尖下宽、呈尖锥状的冰体，高低不等，有的高达四十米左右。这是珠穆朗玛峰冰川中特有的冰的“造型”，它们“成群结队”地绵延数公里，蔚为奇观。
    冰湖：在冰雪覆盖地区，由于冰雪本身结构不均匀，因此消融也是不等量的。在冰雪融解得较多较快的部分，往往形成洼地，储水后即成冰湖。
    冰墙：即尚未融解完、呈墙状矗立的巨大冰面或冰体。
    冰斗：当冰川退缩达最后阶段，在高峰旁侧常有圆形凹地出现，前面有一缺口，形状很像一个漏斗。这种凹地称冰斗，它是冰川流动时“挖”掉巨量积石而形成的，有的深达一二百米。
    冰舌：即冰川前端或从冰斗前面缺口中吐出来的冰流，通常呈舌状，所以叫做冰舌。夏季冰川河床上的冰融化时，就从这个地方出水。
    冰碛：冰川运动过程中“搬运”、“堆积”的物质，统称为冰碛（或称冰碛石）。其形状和堆积内容，常因堆积的地位而不同。在冰川底部的叫底碛；在冰川两旁的叫侧碛；在冰川前端的叫终碛（或称尾碛、前碛、末碛）。冰碛多由粘泥和砾石构成，混杂无层序，其中砾石多带棱角。
    冰蘑菇：堆积在冰川上面的大石块，往往妨碍阳光直接照射到它下面的冰体上，因此，岩石下边的冰由于有岩石的掩盖，往往没有融化而成为一根孤立的冰柱，托着一块巨大的岩石，很像一个蘑菇，通常称它为冰蘑菇。　（新华社稿）
