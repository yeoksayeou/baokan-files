Japan's Economic Expansion in Southeast Asia
Zhang Tingzheng

While plotting new war conspiracies with the United States, the Japanese reactionaries, represented by Nobusuke Kishi, also want to rely on US imperialism to carry out expansion into Southeast Asia.

Japanese imperialism has always coveted the rich resources and vast markets of Southeast Asia. Before the war, Japan constantly clamored that "Southeast Asia is Japan's lifeline" and finally launched the Pacific War. In this war, more than two million Indonesians, two million Vietnamese, and more than one million Filipinos were killed, and the financial losses suffered by Southeast Asian countries are incalculable. After the war, the Japanese monopoly capitalist groups not only showed no remorse, but also attempted to rely on the support of the United States to relive the dream of the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." Since the Yoshida Cabinet, plans for US-Japan cooperation to "develop" Southeast Asia have been constantly formulated. As for the Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet's so-called expansion plan for "developing" Southeast Asian resources with US capital and Japanese technology, it is a replica of the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." In order to use Japan to promote its war policy, the United States regarded Japan as its pawn for economic expansion into Southeast Asia, in order to seize the positions of Britain and France, and also encouraged Japan to carry out economic penetration into Southeast Asia.

After Nobusuke Kishi signed the US-Japan military alliance treaty in Washington and returned to his country, he made a speech at the Special Committee for Foreign Economic Cooperation of the Liberal Democratic Party, again clamoring to step up economic expansion abroad, especially in Southeast Asia. He said that "economic cooperation with underdeveloped countries" is "a major issue" for Japan. Therefore, when formulating economic plans, "it is necessary to reflect the policy of foreign economic cooperation, especially the need to cooperate with Southeast Asian countries." He also said that during his visit to the United States, Eisenhower "fully agreed" with his views. Originally, in the instructions issued by Nobusuke Kishi at the end of May last year regarding the formulation of a long-term economic plan, it was clearly stated that in order to establish the Japanese economy on a stable foundation, it was necessary to establish Japan's "economic sphere of influence." The Japanese Liberal Democratic Party announced in August last year that it would "clearly put forward the issue of developing Southeast Asia as a major national policy," which is to reaffirm "southward advance" as a national policy. Isn't Japan's arrogant ambition for Southeast Asia fully exposed?

Regarding Japan's ambition to expand into Southeast Asia, the representatives of Japanese monopoly capital spoke more bluntly. Shigeo Nagano, chairman of the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations, wrote in the January issue of "Keidanren Monthly" that he believes that in order for Japan to counter the economic groups of capitalist countries, "the most necessary thing is to use US capital and technology on the one hand, and greatly use Japanese capital and technology on the other hand, to promote economic cooperation with Southeast Asia and other backward countries, participate in the economic development of these backward countries, and open up the raw materials needed by Japan and the market for products that Japan can export." In this issue of the magazine, Takeshi Sakurada, president of Nisshin Spinning Co., said that in order to reduce product costs, Japan must utilize the "cheap labor" of Southeast Asia. All this further confirms the aggressive face of Japanese monopoly capital.

Currently, Japan's main target for expansion in Southeast Asia is Indonesia. According to Japan's Jiji News Agency, Japan has decided to focus on Indonesia because Indonesia is rich in resources, has a large population, has a suitable climate, and is the "junction" between the socialist camp and the "free world forces." Therefore, "the United States seems to be using Japanese technology" to provide "economic assistance" to Indonesia. At the same time, Japan is also trying to form a "broad regional market" in Southeast Asia with Indonesia as the center.

During World War II, after the Netherlands was occupied by Hitler, Japan coveted Indonesia, this "ownerless territory," and finally invaded Indonesia, making it its "master." As the judgment of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East pointed out, Japan attacked Indonesia in order to "obtain war necessities, especially oil." After the war, Japan has always coveted this "treasure house of Asia." Tadashi Kobayashi, former president of the Japan Development Bank, said without concealment after visiting Southeast Asia as a roving ambassador in the second half of 1957: "In order to expand into the Southeast Asian economic zone, it is necessary to join hands with Indonesia. Because of the expulsion of Dutch capital, Indonesia has a vacuum of capital and technology."

After Japan and Indonesia signed a reparations agreement in early 1958, Japanese monopoly capital tried its best to use US aid to expand into this so-called "vacuum" area. Most of those who implement the expansion plan are old hands in economic aggression before the war. For example, Yasusaemon Matsunaga, Gisuke Ayukawa, and Hiroichiro Ishihara, known as the "three giants" of "developing" Indonesia, are such figures. Yasusaemon Matsunaga, known as the "demon of the electrical industry" in Japan, suggested using the US "Development Loan Fund" to jointly fund the construction of the Asahan River Dam in North Sumatra, which was surveyed and designed by Kudo Hiroki of the Japanese Industrial Company during World War II. The recently signed agreement for Japan to lend 50 million US dollars to exploit oil in North Sumatra is even more of a mining area that was already being exploited by the Japanese Imperial Oil Company during the war. Now it is just making a comeback. In fact, the predecessor of today's Japan Petroleum Resources Development Company, which came forward to sign the agreement, was the Imperial Oil Company. And the first to propose this plan and personally traveled to Indonesia to promote it was Gisuke Ayukawa, the former head of this development company, who was known as one of the "Five Tigers" of the puppet "Manchukuo" alongside Hideki Tojo and Nobusuke Kishi. As for Hiroichiro Ishihara, who colluded with the military before the war and was a pioneer of the "southward advance," he is still running a bank in the name of Ishihara Sangyo Company in partnership with Indonesian private capital, and is preparing to develop copper mines in Java, electricity resources in Sumatra, and monopolize warehouse businesses in Surabaya and other places. Now Japan is also preparing to provide a loan of 40 million US dollars to "develop" the forests of Kalimantan and plunder the local coal mines; lend 5 million US dollars to monopolize small and medium-sized factories in Indonesia; and Japan's Nippon Yusen is trying to take over Indonesia's foreign shipping. In addition, Japan's reparations to Indonesia in these two years amounted to 54 million US dollars, which included orders for jet trainer aircraft. Japan's investment and loans to Indonesia account for almost one-third of its total investment and loans to Southeast Asia, which shows how fierce Japan's ambition for expansion in Indonesia is.

Of course, Japan's expansion in Southeast Asia is not limited to Indonesia. According to the survey materials of the Asian Section of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs published in the bulletin of the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry not long ago, it can be seen that the tentacles of Japanese monopoly capital have extended into the Philippines, Burma, Thailand, South Vietnam, Pakistan, India, and the Federation of Malaya and Singapore. Japanese financial groups are taking advantage of the opportunity of war reparations to try their best to infiltrate the iron ore, copper ore, and hydroelectric power sectors of the Philippines, as well as Burma's textile industry, fishery, and iron ore. Japanese monopoly enterprises such as Mitsubishi Metal Corporation, Mitsui Metal Corporation, and Fuji Car Company have entered Thailand's tin mines, transportation industry, and trade sectors. Japanese monopoly capital has infiltrated South Vietnam's military engineering, power company projects, papermaking, and lacquer tree planting industries by using illegal "war reparations agreements." Japan has begun to establish "outposts" for the expansion of monopoly capital in Pakistan through "aid" under the "Colombo Plan," starting with the establishment of "technical training centers" and other methods. Japan Steel Corporation has begun to "develop" the Rourkela iron mine and the Bailadila iron mine in India, and is also intensifying its infiltration into India's national industries by establishing "technical centers for small and medium-sized enterprises." In the Federation of Malaya and Singapore, the expansion of Japanese monopoly capital has become increasingly blatant recently. The banking, iron ore, seafood processing, sugar refining, asbestos cement, automobile tires, and even toothpaste manufacturing sectors of Malaya have all been targeted by Japanese monopoly capital for expansion. Japanese monopoly capital has also established joint venture steel rolling mills in Singapore and is preparing to establish oil refining companies.

From the perspective of the areas infiltrated by Japanese monopoly capital, it is clear that it wants to seize the commodity market of Southeast Asia, especially the raw material production areas, through "war reparations," direct investment, and trade dumping policies. It is a well-known fact that Japan uses Southeast Asia as a base for supplying raw materials. In recent years, 80% of Japan's annual iron ore imports have come from Southeast Asia. Japanese private capital's investment in the mining industry in Southeast Asia can be described as "a small investment with huge profits." Taking 1958 as an example, 66% of Japan's total copper ore imports, 22% of iron ore, and 10% of bauxite were obtained through investment. Recently, Japan also reached an agreement with India to "develop" the Bailadila iron mine, planning to import 8 million tons of iron ore annually from India in 1966. In addition, it is also planning to exploit iron ore, oil, and antimony mines in Burma; and to intervene in the iron ore, copper ore in the Philippines, and the uranium, tin, and oil shale in Thailand. It can be seen that no matter what banner of "economic cooperation" the Japanese monopoly capitalist groups are waving, their purpose is to establish their own "economic sphere" in Southeast Asia and attempt to implement a colonial expansion policy of "raw materials from Southeast Asia, industry in Japan."

However, the awakened people of Southeast Asia have increasingly seen through the aggressive ambitions of Japanese monopoly capital, and they are on guard against the resurgence of Japanese militarism. Since Nobusuke Kishi signed the US-Japan military alliance treaty with the United States, especially after he recently forcibly "passed" this treaty in the Diet, the righteous public opinion of Southeast Asian countries has exposed and condemned the expansionist ambitions of Japanese imperialism. Today, the Asian people, including the Japanese people, will never allow the embers of Japanese militarist expansion to rekindle. Under the continuous vigilance and resistance of the Asian people, the expansion plan of the Japanese reactionaries to re-enslave and invade the people of Southeast Asia by relying on the power of US imperialism will eventually be a pipe dream.

    日本对东南亚的经济扩张
    张廷铮
    以岸信介为代表的日本反动派，在同美国一起策划新战争阴谋的同时，还想依靠美帝国主义向东南亚实行扩张。
    日本帝国主义一向垂涎东南亚的丰富资源和广大市场。战前日本曾不断叫嚣“南洋是日本的生命线”，并终于发动太平洋战争。在这次战争中，二百多万印度尼西亚人、二百万越南人、一百多万菲律宾人被夺去了生命，至于东南亚各国遭受的财物损失更无法计算。战后，日本垄断资本集团不但毫无悔过之心，并且企图依靠美国的支持，重温“大东亚共荣圈”的迷梦。自吉田内阁以来，即不断拟订日美合作“开发”东南亚的计划，至于岸信介内阁的所谓美国资本、日本技术“开发”东南亚资源的扩张计划更是“大东亚共荣圈”的翻版。而美国为了利用日本推行它的战争政策，把日本当作它向东南亚经济扩张的马前卒，以便夺取英、法的阵地，也鼓励日本向东南亚实行经济渗透。
    岸信介在华盛顿签署日美军事同盟条约回国后，曾在自由民主党对外经济合作特别委员会发表谈话，再次叫嚷要加紧向国外特别是向东南亚进行经济扩张。他说，“同不发达国家的经济合作”对日本说来“是一个重大的课题”，因此，在拟订经济计划时，“一定要体现对外经济合作的政策，尤其是需要同东南亚各国实行合作”。他还说，在访问美国时，艾森豪威尔“完全同意”他的看法。本来，去年5月底岸信介发出有关制订长期经济计划的指示中已明白表示，为了使日本经济建立在稳定的基础上，有必要建立日本的“经济势力范围”。日本自由民主党在去年8月间宣布“明确地提出开发东南亚问题作为国家的一大政策”，也就是再度肯定以“南进”为国策。日本对东南亚的狂妄野心不是已充分暴露了吗？
    关于日本向东南亚扩张的野心，日本垄断资本的代表人物说得更露骨。日本经济团体联合会长石坂泰三在今年1月号“经团联月报”撰文说，他认为日本为了与资本主义各国的经济集团互相对抗，“最必要的是一方面利用美国的资本和技术，同时大大利用日本的资本和技术，推进同东南亚及其他落后国家的经济合作，参加这些落后国家的经济开发，为日本开拓所需要的原料和日本所能出口的产品的市场”。在这期杂志上，日清纺织公司总经理樱田武表示，为了降低产品成本，日本必须利用东南亚的“便宜劳动力”。这一切更证实了日本垄断资本的侵略面目。
    目前，日本对东南亚扩张的主要目标是印度尼西亚。据日本时事通讯社透露，日本决定以印度尼西亚为重点，理由是印度尼西亚资源丰富，人口众多，气候适宜，并且是社会主义阵营和“自由主义势力”之间的“结合点”，因此“美国似将利用日本的技术”对印度尼西亚进行“经济援助”，同时日本还企图以印度尼西亚为中心形成在东南亚的“广大区域市场”。
    在第二次世界大战中，自荷兰被希特勒占领后，日本便垂涎印度尼西亚这块“无主的领土”，并终于侵占印度尼西亚，作了它的“主人”。正如远东国际军事法庭判决书所指出，日本进攻印度尼西亚是为了“取得战争必需品特别是石油”。战后，日本仍一直垂涎这个“亚洲的宝库”。日本前开发银行总裁小林中，1957年下半年以东南亚巡回大使名义访问回国后，毫不掩饰地说：“为了向东南亚经济圈进行扩张，必须与印度尼西亚携手。由于赶走了荷兰资本，印度尼西亚产生了资本和技术的真空状态”。
    1958年初日本和印度尼西亚签订赔偿协定后，日本垄断资本就尽量利用美国的援助，向这块所谓“真空”地带大举扩张。执行扩张计划的大多是战前经济侵略的老手。例如号称“开发”印度尼西亚“三巨头”的松永安左卫门、鲇川义介、石原广一郎都是这样的人物。号称日本“电气界之鬼”的松永安左卫门建议利用美国“开发贷款基金”共同出资建筑北苏门答腊阿苏汗河水坝，这是二次大战中日本工业公司的工藤宏规所调查设计的。最近签订的由日本贷款五千万美元开采北苏门答腊石油的协定，更是战时日本帝国石油公司业已进行开采的矿区，现在只是卷土重来。其实今天出面签字的日本石油资源开发公司的前身就是帝国石油公司。而首先提出这个计划并亲自往印度尼西亚活动的，就是这个开发公司的前主持人、曾和东条英机、岸信介齐名被称为伪“满洲国”
  “五虎”之一的鲇川义介。至于石原广一郎战前与军部相勾结是“南进”的急先锋，今天竟仍以石原产业公司的名义和印度尼西亚私人资本合资开办了银行，并且准备开发爪哇的铜矿、苏门答腊的电力资源和垄断泗水等地的仓库业。现在日本还准备提供贷款四千万美元“开发”加里曼丹的森林，掠夺当地的煤矿；贷款五百万美元垄断印度尼西亚的中小型工厂；而日本邮船公司正企图包办印度尼西亚的对外航运。此外，这两年度日本对印度尼西亚的赔款达五千四百万美元，其中包含着喷气式教练机的订货。日本对印度尼西亚的投资和贷款几占对东南亚全部投资、贷款的三分之一，这就说明日本对印度尼西亚的扩张野心是如何炽烈了。
    当然，日本对东南亚的扩张并不限于印度尼西亚。仅据不久前日本通商产业省公报所刊载的日本外务省亚洲科的调查材料，就可以看出日本垄断资本的触角已经伸进了菲律宾、缅甸、泰国、南越、巴基斯坦、印度及马来亚联合邦和新加坡等地。日本财阀利用战争赔偿的机会极力渗入菲律宾的铁矿、铜矿和水力发电部门以及缅甸的纺织工业、渔业和铁矿。日本三菱金属公司、三井金属公司及富士车辆公司等垄断企业打入了泰国的锡矿、交通运输业和贸易部门。日本垄断资本利用非法的“战争赔偿协定”渗入了南越的军事工程、电力企业工程、造纸及漆树种植业部门等等。日本通过
  “科伦坡计划”的“援助”开始以建立“技术训练中心”等方式在巴基斯坦设立垄断资本扩张的“前哨阵地”。日本钢铁公司着手“开发”印度的鲁尔克拉铁矿和贝拉第拉铁矿，还以建立“中小企业技术中心”为手段，加紧渗入印度的民族工业。在马来亚联合邦和新加坡，日本垄断资本的扩张近来日趋露骨。马来亚的银行业、铁矿、水产加工、砂糖精制、石棉水泥、汽车轮胎以至牙粉制造部门都被日本垄断资本当作扩张的对象。日本垄断资本还在新加坡建立了合资的轧钢厂，并准备建立炼油公司。
    从日本垄断资本渗入的方面来看，显然它是要通过“战争赔偿”、直接投资和贸易倾销政策来攫取东南亚的商品市场，特别是原料产地。日本以东南亚作为供应原料的基地，这是众所周知的事实。近年来日本每年输入铁矿砂的80％来自东南亚。日本私人资本对东南亚采矿业的投资可谓“一本万利”，以1958年为例，日本铜矿进口总额的66％，铁矿砂的22％，铁矾土的10％都是由于投资而到手的。最近日本又与印度达成了“开发”贝拉第拉铁矿的协议，计划在1966年度每年由印度进口铁矿砂八百万吨。此外尚拟开采缅甸的铁矿、石油、锑矿；染指菲律宾的铁矿、铜矿，泰国的铀矿、锡矿、油页岩等。由此可见，不论日本垄断资本集团打着“经济合作”的幌子，其目的就是要在东南亚建立自己的“经济圈”，妄图实行“原料东南亚、工业日本”的殖民扩张政策。
    但是，觉醒了的东南亚人民已日益识破日本垄断资本的侵略野心，他们正在警惕着日本军国主义的卷土重来。自从岸信介同美国签订日美军事同盟条约，特别是最近在国会强行
  “通过”这个条约以后，东南亚各国正义舆论纷纷揭露和谴责日本帝国主义的扩张野心。今天，亚洲人民，包括日本人民在内，决不容许日本军国主义扩张的死灰复燃。在亚洲人民不断提高警惕和反抗下，日本反动派想借美帝国主义的势力重新奴役和侵略东南亚人民的扩张计划终将是一场春梦。
