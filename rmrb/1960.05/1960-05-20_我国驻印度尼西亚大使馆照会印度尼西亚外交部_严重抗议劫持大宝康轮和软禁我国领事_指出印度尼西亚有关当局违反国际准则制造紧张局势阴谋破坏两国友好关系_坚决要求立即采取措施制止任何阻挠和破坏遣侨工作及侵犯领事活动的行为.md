Xinhua News Agency, 19th. The Embassy of the People's Republic of China lodged a strong protest with the Indonesian Foreign Ministry on May 9, 1960, regarding the incident on April 27, 1960, in Selat Panjang, Riau Province, Indonesia, in which Indonesian authorities forcibly seized the "Da Baokang" vessel sent by the Chinese government to receive overseas Chinese. The full text of the note is as follows:

The Embassy of the People's Republic of China presents its compliments to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia and states the following regarding the incident on April 27, 1960, in Selat Panjang, in which Indonesian authorities forcibly seized the Da Baokang vessel, which had completed all procedures and been approved to sail, sent by the Chinese government to Indonesia to transport overseas Chinese:

After the Embassy informed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia that the Chinese government had decided to send the Da Baokang vessel to Selat Panjang to transport the overseas Chinese fire victims in the area and obtained the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' agreement, the Consulate General of the People's Republic of China in Medan dispatched Liu Qingyou, Attaché Consul, to Pekanbaru on April 15, 1960, and then to Selat Panjang to assist in handling the repatriation of the aforementioned overseas Chinese.

After Attaché Consul Liu Qingyou arrived in Pekanbaru, he held talks with local authorities on matters related to the repatriation of the aforementioned overseas Chinese. During the talks, Captain Selamat, representative of the military and political authorities of Riau Province, expressed his willingness to provide strong assistance and agreed to simplify the departure procedures for the overseas Chinese fire victims. At the same time, the Governor of Riau Province also appointed Mr. Arlis, the Regent of Bengkalis, as the governor's representative to assist in the repatriation of the aforementioned overseas Chinese in Selat Panjang.

With the assistance and cooperation of the local authorities, all necessary departure procedures for the 702 overseas Chinese fire victims aboard the Da Baokang vessel were completed between April 22 and 25. The Immigration Office issued a collective exit permit, the Tax Bureau issued a tax list and tax reduction certificate, and the Customs also inspected all the luggage carried by the aforementioned overseas Chinese. It is worth pointing out that the aforementioned overseas Chinese were all fire victims whose homes had been destroyed. The 702 people carried only 366 pieces of luggage, both large and small. Even so, the authorities still confiscated four bicycles and three sewing machines during the inspection. As for the fingerprinting issue, the authorities initially stipulated that each person had to provide 72 fingerprints. Since the authorities had agreed to simplify the departure procedures for the fire victims, the aforementioned fire victims requested the authorities to be flexible. After Attaché Consul Liu Qingyou consulted with Regent Arlis, Regent Arlis agreed to replace fingerprinting with signatures. Although there were some difficulties in handling the procedures, they were resolved smoothly through friendly consultation between the two parties.

At 10:00 a.m. on April 26, Governor's representative Arlis informed Attaché Consul Liu Qingyou that all procedures had been completed and the ship could sail at 4:00 p.m. that afternoon. Later that day, Mr. Anan, Director of the Bengkalis Foreign Nationals Bureau, once again informed Attaché Consul Liu Qingyou that the procedures had been completed and the ship could sail. However, due to the lateness of the hour, the ship could not leave the port, so it was decided to postpone the departure to 5:00 a.m. on April 27. However, on the next day, due to engine failure, the ship could not sail on time and was delayed until 8:00 a.m. When the Da Baokang vessel left the port, the Selat Panjang Prosecutor, acting on the order of the Pekanbaru Prosecutor, Harahap, used the excuse that the departure procedures for the aforementioned 702 overseas Chinese had not been completed and ordered armed personnel to pursue the Da Baokang vessel by speedboat. When the speedboat caught up with the Da Baokang vessel, the armed personnel on board fired shots and forced the Da Baokang vessel to return to the port of Selat Panjang. Attaché Consul Liu Qingyou made representations to the authorities concerned, and learned that the "reason" for seizing the Da Baokang vessel was that the overseas Chinese had not provided fingerprints. Attaché Consul Liu Qingyou immediately pointed out that the authorities concerned had twice notified them on the 26th that all procedures had been completed and that the ship could sail, and that no notification had been received to fingerprint the overseas Chinese until the ship sailed. He believed that this inconsistent approach was deliberately creating an incident and expressed deep regret over the forced seizure of the Da Baokang vessel. The British captain of the Da Baokang vessel also expressed great indignation and dissatisfaction with the act of forcibly seizing the vessel and questioned the relevant officials.

Subsequently, at around 11:00 a.m. on the 27th, Selat Panjang Police Chief Sudiarto, military representative Yaya, and Bengkalis Foreign Nationals Bureau Director Anan took turns informing Attaché Consul Liu Qingyou that the decision made on April 26 to allow the ship to sail remained unchanged, that the ship could sail now, and that they apologized for the forced seizure of the Da Baokang vessel. Around 12:00 noon on the same day, Police Chief Sudiarto personally boarded the ship to inform the British captain of the Da Baokang vessel to sail immediately and guaranteed that such incidents would not happen again, and then sent armed personnel to escort the ship out of the port by speedboat. Even so, it is said that Indonesian Attorney General Gunawan, Bachelor of Laws, even requested the Indonesian Navy to assist in pursuing the so-called privately fleeing Da Baokang vessel.

However, surprisingly, the news released by the Indonesian Attorney General's Office to Antara News Agency on May 2 and 3 stated that after a consul from the People's Republic of China arrived from Medan, the attitude of the 750 overseas Chinese in Selat Panjang who were willing to return to their country suddenly changed, disobeying government regulations, refusing to have their luggage inspected, refusing to provide fingerprints, etc. It also stated that a ship of the People's Republic of China sent to Indonesia to transport overseas Chinese affected by Government Regulation No. 10 in Riau Province transported 750 overseas Chinese without the permission of the authorities and quietly fled the territorial waters of Riau, which is completely without factual basis. It should be pointed out that Attaché Consul Liu Qingyou maintained good cooperation with local military and political officials during his mission in Selat Panjang. For example, guiding overseas Chinese groups to assist relevant parties in handling various procedures, rushing to print the required photos for each household overnight, filling out various necessary forms, and filling out eleven copies of the list of 702 overseas Chinese, etc. It should also be pointed out that the Da Baokang vessel left the port of Selat Panjang after the aforementioned overseas Chinese completed all necessary departure procedures, the Immigration Office returned the passports of the ship's crew, the Port Authority returned the relevant documents of the ship to the British captain of the Da Baokang vessel, and the authorities notified twice that the ship was allowed to sail. After the vessel was forcibly seized, the authorities once again notified that the ship was allowed to sail and sent armed personnel to escort the vessel out of the port by speedboat. After the Da Baokang vessel left, the Selat Panjang Port Authority immediately telegraphed the Roa Shipping Agency in Jakarta, saying that the Da Baokang vessel had sailed on April 27.

The Embassy of the People's Republic of China believes that the Indonesian authorities' forcible seizure of the Da Baokang vessel in Selat Panjang and the Attorney General's Office's fabrication of facts, falsely accusing the Da Baokang vessel of fleeing privately, and publicly defaming the Attaché Consul of the People's Republic of China are extremely unfriendly actions. It should be pointed out that although the Indonesian authorities in charge have repeatedly claimed that they will provide strong assistance to overseas Chinese who are willing to return to their country to ensure their smooth return, the overseas Chinese who have recently returned to their country have been unreasonably obstructed and harassed in a series of ways. This shows that the incident of the forced seizure of the Da Baokang vessel was not accidental or isolated. Obviously, some people who do not want China and Indonesia to be friendly are deliberately creating tensions, obstructing the return of overseas Chinese, and conspiring to undermine the friendly relations between China and Indonesia. The Embassy of the People's Republic of China strongly protests against this.

In order to maintain the friendship between China and Indonesia, the Embassy requests the Indonesian government to take immediate measures to punish the perpetrators, prevent similar incidents and other incidents from happening again, and at the same time, in order to comprehensively and properly arrange the repatriation of overseas Chinese, it is hoped that the two sides will reach an agreement on the repatriation of overseas Chinese as soon as possible, so that those overseas Chinese who have lost their livelihoods, are unable to make a living, or are unwilling to continue residing in Indonesia can return to their country smoothly.

Please accept the highest respect.

Jakarta, May 9, 1960

Xinhua News Agency, 19th. The Embassy of the People's Republic of China lodged a strong protest with the Indonesian Foreign Ministry on May 13, 1960, regarding the incident on April 27, 1960, in Samarinda, East Kalimantan Province, in which the military authorities forcibly placed the Consul of the People's Republic of China in Banjarmasin, Jiang Yan, under house arrest. The full text of the note is as follows:

The Embassy of the People's Republic of China presents its compliments to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia and states the following regarding the serious incident on April 27, 1960, in Samarinda, East Kalimantan, in which the military forcibly placed Mr. Jiang Yan, Consul of the People's Republic of China in Banjarmasin, under house arrest:

On April 26, 1960, the Haihuang vessel sent by the government of the People's Republic of China to transport the displaced overseas Chinese in East Kalimantan who were forced to relocate arrived at the mouth of the Samarinda River. Consul Jiang Yan of the People's Republic of China in Banjarmasin accompanied the ship from Balikpapan to Samarinda to assist in handling the repatriation of the displaced overseas Chinese.

Thanks to the cooperation of overseas Chinese groups and local governments, the procedures for the return of the displaced overseas Chinese had been basically completed before the ship arrived. On the 27th, the final procedure of fingerprinting began. According to the agreement between Consul Jiang Yan and the authorities concerned, this procedure was scheduled to be completed before 4:00 p.m. on the same day so that the Haihuang vessel could set sail on the same day. However, the personnel of the local Prosecutor's Office deliberately delayed the process. By about 5:00 p.m., only more than 100 people had completed fingerprinting, and more than 500 displaced overseas Chinese, supporting the old and carrying the young, were still waiting in the fingerprinting venue - the Chinese School, etc. Then, Prosecutor Hamzah suddenly announced the suspension of the fingerprinting procedure. For this reason, Consul Jiang Yan immediately discussed with the prosecutor and requested to continue the procedure so that the ship could sail as soon as possible, but the prosecutor unreasonably refused to discuss and left the Chinese School immediately. Subsequently, Consul Jiang Yan also made an appointment to meet with Lieutenant Sairi, the military authority in charge of the repatriation of the displaced overseas Chinese in Kutai, but Lieutenant Sairi replied that he would go to the consul's residence to discuss that evening, but did not keep the appointment. Then, the entire city of Samarinda suddenly experienced a power outage, and a large number of armed personnel were dispatched to surround the Chinese School, the wharf, and the residences of the overseas Chinese community leaders, and set up posts everywhere, prohibiting the overseas Chinese community leaders from going out and meeting with the consul, blocking their telephones, and placing Mr. Cai Jinfah, the head of the local Chinese General Association, under house arrest. The armed personnel at the wharf even set up machine guns to intimidate more than 200 overseas Chinese students who were assisting in carrying the luggage of the displaced overseas Chinese there with the consent of the local authorities, forcing them to leave the wharf immediately; another group of armed personnel rushed to the Chinese School and dispersed the displaced overseas Chinese who were waiting there to provide fingerprints. At the same time, the military sent two armed personnel to Consul Jiang Yan's residence to convey the "decision" of Major Mudarqi, the commander of Battalion 601, the local military authority, unreasonably demanding that the consul not leave his residence, not meet with overseas Chinese, and must leave Samarinda for Balikpapan before 8:00 p.m. on April 28. At the same time, posts were set up to forcibly place Consul Jiang Yan under house arrest for as long as 41 hours. Overseas Chinese were also not allowed to enter the consul's residence, and Mr. Lu Yaoda, the general leader of the displaced overseas Chinese who came to visit, and Mr. Guan Zhuning, who led the students to carry the luggage of the displaced overseas Chinese, were taken to the gendarmerie for interrogation.

Consul Jiang Yan expressed a stern attitude towards the military's extremely unreasonable actions and sent two letters to Lieutenant Sairi, the military authority in Kutai, requesting a meeting, but Lieutenant Sairi made two appointments to go to the consul's residence for a meeting, but both times he broke the appointment and avoided seeing him. It was not until the morning of April 29 that Lieutenant Sairi came to see Consul Jiang Yan with armed personnel and claimed that armed personnel would be dispatched to "escort" the consul to Balikpapan. Consul Jiang Yan immediately sternly refused, pointing out that the military's act of forcibly placing the consul under house arrest rudely infringed on the consular powers and personal safety and freedom, obstructed the return of overseas Chinese, and threatened the lives and property of overseas Chinese in Samarinda, demanding that the military explain this incident. And lodged an oral strong protest.

On April 30, after Consul Jiang Yan returned to Balikpapan, he once again lodged an oral strong protest against the serious incident to Major Subagio and Major Purlianto, representatives of the East Kalimantan military.

It should be pointed out that the incident in Samarinda in which the military forcibly placed Consul Jiang Yan of the People's Republic of China in Banjarmasin under house arrest was by no means accidental. As early as March 11, when Consul Jiang Yan traveled from Banjarmasin to East Kalimantan, the Kalimantan Inter-Regional Liaison Command carried out all kinds of unreasonable obstruction and harassment. When Consul Jiang Yan set off, the military used the excuse that the consul's inspection tour must be approved by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia and the Kalimantan Inter-Regional Liaison Command to order the local airline not to sell air tickets to Consul Jiang Yan, obstructing him. But in fact, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia had already notified that the consul did not need to obtain the consent of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for inspection tours within his consular district. After Consul Jiang Yan arrived in Balikpapan, the local military threatened Consul Jiang Yan not to go to Samarinda, and even asked Consul Jiang Yan to register at the local Immigration Office. Only after Consul Jiang Yan's stern representations did the military agree to allow him to go to Samarinda, but they limited him to returning to Balikpapan on March 14 and did not allow Consul Jiang Yan to meet with more than five overseas Chinese.

The Embassy of the People's Republic of China believes that the action of the Samarinda military in forcibly placing Consul Jiang Yan of the People's Republic of China in Banjarmasin under house arrest is another serious incident of forcibly obstructing the sending of ships by the People's Republic of China to receive overseas Chinese, which occurred at the same time as the incident in Selat Panjang in which the authorities forcibly seized the Da Baokang vessel. This incident has seriously threatened the safety of local overseas Chinese, unreasonably restricted the right of the consul of the People's Republic of China to perform normal duties, and even brutally infringed on his personal freedom. This not only violates generally accepted international norms and the repeated promises of the government of the Republic of Indonesia to assist overseas Chinese who voluntarily return to their country to return smoothly, but is also an extremely unfriendly act towards the People's Republic of China. The Embassy of the People's Republic of China strongly protests against this. The Embassy of the People's Republic of China firmly demands that the government of the Republic of Indonesia promptly deal with this incident and the incident of forcibly seizing the Da Baokang vessel, make a reply as soon as possible, and immediately take effective measures to stop any obstruction and sabotage of the repatriation of overseas Chinese and infringement of consular activities.

Please accept the highest respect.

    我国驻印度尼西亚大使馆照会印度尼西亚外交部
    严重抗议劫持大宝康轮和软禁我国领事
    指出印度尼西亚有关当局违反国际准则制造紧张局势阴谋破坏两国友好关系
    坚决要求立即采取措施制止任何阻挠和破坏遣侨工作及侵犯领事活动的行为
    新华社19日讯　中华人民共和国驻印度尼西亚大使馆于1960年5月9日就4月27日在印度尼西亚廖内省石叻班让发生的印度尼西亚有关当局武力劫持我国政府派去接侨的“大宝康”轮的事件向印度尼西亚外交部提出了严重抗议照会。照会全文如下：
    中华人民共和国大使馆向印度尼西亚共和国外交部致意并就1960年4月27日在石叻班让发生的印度尼西亚有关当局武力劫持已办好一切手续并被准许开航的中国政府派往印度尼西亚接运华侨的大宝康轮事件申述如下：
    在大使馆通知印度尼西亚共和国外交部关于中国政府决定派大宝康轮前往石叻班让接运该地遭受火灾华侨灾民并且获得外交部同意后，中华人民共和国驻棉兰领事馆即于1960年4月15日派刘庆有随习领事前往北干峇汝转赴石叻班让协助办理上述华侨灾民回国事宜。
    刘庆有随习领事抵达北干峇汝后，曾与当地有关当局就有关上述华侨回国事宜进行了会谈。在会谈中，廖内省军政当局代表塞拉玛特上尉表示愿予以大力协助，并同意简化华侨灾民的出境手续，同时廖内省省长还指派了望加丽县长阿利斯作为省长的代表前往石叻班让就地协助遣送上述华侨回国的工作。
    在地方当局的协助和合作下，七百零二名乘坐大宝康轮的华侨灾民的一切必要的出境手续在4月22日至25日期间已全部办理就绪。移民厅发给了集体出境准字，税务局发给了税务清单和减免税务证明书，同时，海关也检查了上述华侨所携带的全部行李。值得指出的是：上述华侨都是遭受火灾的灾民，他们的家产被焚毁殆尽，七百零二人所携带的大小行李仅三百六十六件，即使如此，有关当局在检查中仍扣留了四辆自行车和三架缝纫机等。至于盖手指印问题，最初有关当局规定每个人必须盖七十二个手指印，由于有关当局已同意了简化灾侨出境手续，上述灾侨要求有关当局通融处理，经刘庆有随习领事同阿利斯县长商谈结果，阿利斯县长同意以签字代替盖手指印。尽管在办理手续方面存在一些困难，但经过双方友好协商后，都比较顺利地解决了。
    4月26日上午十时，省长代表阿利斯通知刘庆有随习领事说，一切手续已办妥，下午四时船即可开航。当天下午，望加丽外侨局主任阿南先生再一次通知刘庆有随习领事说，手续办妥了，船即可开航。但由于当时天色已晚，船不能出港，因此决定延至4月27日晨五时再开航。但次日由于船的机器发生故障，未能准时开航，延至该晨八时始开航。在大宝康轮驶离港口后，石叻班让检察官奉北干峇汝检察官哈拉哈的命令，借口上述七百零二名华侨的出境手续尚未办完，下令派武装人员乘快艇追拦大宝康轮。当该快艇赶上大宝康轮时，艇上武装人员竟然开枪射击，强迫大宝康轮驶回石叻班让港口。为此，刘庆有随习领事曾向有关当局提出交涉，才知道劫持大宝康轮的“理由”是因为华侨未盖手印，刘庆有随习领事当即指出，26日有关当局曾两次通知，一切手续业已办妥，可以开航，而且到该轮开航为止并未接到要华侨盖手印的任何通知，并认为这种出尔反尔的做法显然是故意制造事件，并对大宝康轮被武力劫持事表示深切的遗憾。大宝康英国籍船长对这种用武力劫持该轮的行动也表示极大愤慨和不满，并向有关官员提出了质问。
    随后，即在27日中午十一时左右，石叻班让警察长苏迪阿多，驻军代表雅雅和望加丽县外侨局主任阿南轮流前来告知刘庆有随习领事说，4月26日所作的关于准许开航的决定仍然不变，船现在即可开航，并对武力劫持大宝康轮的事件表示歉意。同日中午十二时左右，苏迪阿多警察长亲自登轮通知大宝康英国籍船长立即开航，并保证不再发生类此事件，随后即派武装人员乘快艇护送出港。即使如此，据说，印度尼西亚最高检察官古那宛法学士竟然要求印度尼西亚共和国海军部协助追拦所谓私自逃跑的大宝康轮。
    但是，令人惊奇的是，1960年5月2日和3日印度尼西亚最高检察署向安塔拉通讯社发表的消息竟说，从棉兰来了一名中华人民共和国的领事后，石叻班让愿意回国的七百五十名华侨的态度突然改变，不服从政府的规定，拒绝行李受检查，不盖手指印等，又说派往印度尼西亚接运廖内省受第十号政府条例影响的华侨的一艘中华人民共和国船只，在未经当局许可的情况下，运载七百五十名华侨，静悄悄地逃离廖内领海，这是毫无事实根据的。应该指出，刘庆有随习领事在石叻班让执行任务期间，与当地军政官员进行了良好的合作。例如，指导侨团协助有关方面处理各种手续，通宵赶印出每户所需要的照片，填写各种必要表格和填写七百零二名华侨的名单十一份等。还应该指出大宝康轮是在上述华侨办妥一切必要的出境手续，移民厅交还了船上工作人员的护照，港务局把该船的有关证件交还了大宝康英国籍船长，并经当局两次通知准许开航之后才离开石叻班让港口的，而在该轮被武力劫持后，当局又再一次通知准许开航，并派武装人员乘快艇护送该轮出港。石叻班让港务局在大宝康轮开离后即打电报通知雅加达罗埃船务代理公司说，大宝康轮已于4月27日开航。
    中华人民共和国大使馆认为，印度尼西亚有关当局在石叻班让武力劫持大宝康轮以及最高检察署捏造事实，反诬大宝康轮私自逃跑，并且公开诽谤中华人民共和国随习领事的事件，是一种极不友好的行动。应该指出，尽管印度尼西亚负责当局一再声称对愿意回国的华侨予以大力协助，使之顺利回国，但是，最近回国的华侨却遭到一系列的无理阻挠和刁难，这表明大宝康轮被武力劫持的事件并不是偶然的，也不是孤立的。显然，这是一些不愿意中国和印度尼西亚友好的人有意制造紧张局势，阻挠华侨回国，阴谋破坏中国和印度尼西亚之间的友好关系。对此，中华人民共和国大使馆提出严重抗议。
    为了维护中国和印度尼西亚之间的友谊，大使馆要求印度尼西亚政府立即采取措施，惩办肇事人员，防止今后再发生类似事件及其他事件，同时为了通盘和妥善安排遣送华侨回国的工作，希望双方不再迟延地立即就有关遣送华侨回国的问题达成一项协议，以便使那些丧失生计，无法谋生或不愿意继续在印度尼西亚居留的华侨能顺利回国。
    顺致最崇高的敬意。
    此致印度尼西亚共和国外交部
                                    1960年5月9日于雅加达
    新华社19日讯　中华人民共和国驻印度尼西亚大使馆于1960年5月13日就4月27日印度尼西亚东加里曼丹省三马林达的军事当局武力软禁我国驻马辰领事江燕的事件向印度尼西亚外交部提出了严重抗议照会，照会全文如下：
    中华人民共和国驻印度尼西亚大使馆向印度尼西亚共和国外交部致意并就1960年4月27日东加里曼丹三马林达军方武力软禁中华人民共和国驻马辰领事江燕先生的严重事件，申述如下：
    1960年4月26日，中华人民共和国政府派出接运东加里曼丹被逼迁难侨的海皇轮抵达三马林达海口。中华人民共和国驻马辰领事江燕随船从麻里巴板前往三马林达，协助办理遣送难侨回国事宜。
    由于侨团和当地政府的合作，难侨回国手续在船到达前已基本上办妥。27日开始办理最后一项手续——盖指印。按照江燕领事和有关当局商定，此项手续预定在当天下午四时前办完，以便海皇轮可在当日启航。但当地检察署人员故意拖延，到下午五时许，仅有一百多人盖完指印，还有五百多个难侨扶老携幼地仍在盖指印的场所——中华学校等候，而检察官哈姆沙先生突然宣布停止办理盖指印手续。为此，江燕领事即与检察官商谈，要求能继续办理手续，以便及早开船，但该检察官竟无理拒绝商谈，并即离开了中华学校。随后，江燕领事又约见当地负责处理这次难侨回国工作的高砥县军事掌权者沙伊里中尉，沙伊里中尉答应当晚去领事住所商谈，但没有践约。接着，整个三马林达市突然停电，大批武装人员出动，包围了中华学校、码头和侨团负责人住所，并布满岗哨，不准侨团负责人外出和会见领事，封锁了他们的电话，并软禁了当地中华总会负责人蔡金发先生。而码头的武装人员竟架起机关枪，对经地方当局同意在那里协助搬运难侨行李的二百余名华侨学生进行恫吓，强迫他们立即离开码头；另有一部分武装人员则赶到中华学校，驱散正在那里等候盖指印的难侨。与此同时，军方又派出两名武装人员到江燕领事住所，传达当地军事掌权者六○一营营长慕达尔基少校的“决定”，竟无理要求领事不得离开住所，不得和华侨会面，并必须在4月28日晚八时前离开三马林达去麻里巴板。同时设置岗哨，对江燕领事加以武力软禁达四十一小时之久，同时也不准华侨进入领事住所，并将来访的难侨总领队卢耀达先生和带领学生搬运难侨行李的关祝宁先生带去宪兵部审问。
    对军方这种极端无理的行动，江燕领事曾表示了严正的态度，先后两次致函高砥县军事掌权者沙伊里中尉要求面谈，而沙伊里中尉两次约定到领事住所进行面谈，但均失约，避而不见。一直拖到4月29日上午，沙伊里中尉才带着武装人员来见江燕领事，并声言将派武装人员“陪送”领事去麻里巴板。江燕领事当即严加拒绝，指出军方武力软禁领事的行为，粗暴地侵犯了领事职权与人身安全和自由，阻挠华侨回国，并使三马林达华侨的生命财产遭到威胁，要求军方对此事件作出交代。并提出了口头严重抗议。
    4月30日江燕领事回到麻里巴板后，再次就此严重事件向东加里曼丹军方代表苏巴基奥少校和普尔里安多少校提出口头严重抗议。
    应当指出，三马林达军方武力软禁中华人民共和国驻马辰领事江燕的事件的发生绝不是偶然的。早在3月11日，江燕领事自马辰前往东加里曼丹时，加里曼丹区际联络司令部就进行了种种无理的阻挠和刁难。当江燕领事动身时，军方就以领事出巡须经印度尼西亚共和国外交部和加里曼丹区际联络司令部的准许为借口，命令当地航空公司不准卖机票给江燕领事，予以阻难。但事实上印度尼西亚共和国外交部早已通知，领事在其领区内出巡，无需得到外交部的同意。在江燕领事到麻里巴板后，当地军方又威胁江燕领事不得前往三马林达，并且竟要江燕领事去当地移民厅登记，经江燕领事严正交涉后，军方才同意他去三马林达，但又限令须于3月14日返回麻里巴板，并且不准江燕领事接见五个以上的华侨。
    中华人民共和国大使馆认为，三马林达军方武力软禁中华人民共和国驻马辰领事江燕的行动，是与石叻班让有关当局武力劫持大宝康轮事件同时发生的另一件用武力阻挠中华人民共和国派船接侨的严重事件。这一事件使当地华侨安全受到严重威胁，使中华人民共和国的领事行使正常职务的权利受到无理限制，甚至人身自由遭到粗暴的侵犯。这不仅违反了公认的国际准则，违背了印度尼西亚共和国政府一再宣称要协助自愿回国的华侨顺利回国的诺言，而且是对中华人民共和国极不友好的行为。对此，中华人民共和国大使馆提出严重抗议。中华人民共和国大使馆坚决要求印度尼西亚共和国政府对这次事件和武力劫持大宝康轮事件迅速予以处理，及早作出答复，并立即采取有效措施，制止任何阻挠和破坏遣侨工作和侵犯领事活动的行为。
                                            顺致
    最崇高的敬意。
