    Support You
    News of heroic struggles has flown in from South Korea, Turkey, and Japan. Carrying sparks, carrying blood, carrying justice, they ignite the fighting spirit of the people of the world. You have turned over the raging tides of the sea,冲过 the Pacific,冲过 the Atlantic! Look! The iron arms of those fighting for freedom are raised even higher across the globe. The oppressed have发出 the loudest cry for freedom. You use struggle to write the most beautiful and best declaration: true freedom can only be achieved through struggle, true liberation can only be achieved through resistance, true peace can only be achieved by standing up and fighting!

    支持你们
    初蕾从南朝鲜、土耳其、日本，飞来了英勇斗争的消息。带着火花，带着鲜血，带着正义，激发起世界人民的斗志。你们翻开了大海的怒潮，冲过太平洋，冲过大西洋，看！全球更高的举起了争自由的铁臂。被压迫者发出了争自由的最强音。你们用斗争写下最美最好的宣言；要真自由只有斗争，要真解放只有还击，要真和平只有站起来干！
