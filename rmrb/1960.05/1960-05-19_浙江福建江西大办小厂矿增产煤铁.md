    Zhejiang, Fujian, and Jiangxi Vigorously Develop Small Factories and Mines to Increase Coal and Iron Production
    Zhejiang
    Developing Various Small Enterprises Centered on Coal and Iron
    (Our Dispatch from Hangzhou, May 18) A mass movement to develop "small-scale indigenous groups" and "small-scale modern groups" of enterprises centered on coal and iron is vigorously unfolding in Zhejiang Province's coal, steel, mining, electricity, building materials, transportation, chemical, and other industries. In the past month or so, the province has developed a batch of small blast furnaces, small coal pits, small mines, and other small-scale enterprises, as well as earthen railways and simple roads serving coal and iron.
    In the mass movement to develop "small-scale indigenous groups" and "small-scale modern groups" of enterprises, all localities have implemented the policy of combining indigenous and modern methods, relying on their own efforts to solve problems in equipment, materials, and technical forces for furnace construction and mining. When constructing small coal pits and small mines, the Jiaxing area used bamboo and wood instead of iron to manufacture rails, small dump trucks, and other equipment, which rapidly improved transportation efficiency. All sectors of society regard supporting the construction of "small-scale indigenous groups" and "small-scale modern groups" of enterprises as an important task. When a batch of small coal pits were being constructed in the Jinhua area, tools and equipment were insufficient. Many factories and mines immediately provided strong support. The machinery factory and others sent steel drills and steel hammers to the small coal pits, and the bamboo ware factory made a rush effort to weave coal-carrying baskets, accelerating the construction speed of the small coal pits.
    In order to develop "small-scale indigenous groups" and "small-scale modern groups" of enterprises centered on coal and iron at high speed, local, municipal, and county Party committees have established special leading bodies, headed by the first secretary or industrial secretary. Leadership is strengthened from top to bottom, plans are formulated, and the masses are mobilized to build in stages and batches based on the principles of proximity to raw materials, convenient transportation, and resources. The Party committee secretaries of people's communes in the Jinhua area led cadres to explore mineral deposits in the mountains, prospecting and mining simultaneously, and quickly set up a batch of small coal pits.
    Fujian
    More Than 60,000 People Go to the Mountains and Factories to Mine Coal and Build Blast Furnaces
    (Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou) A massive mass movement to vigorously develop small iron plants and small coal mines is unfolding in Fujian Province.
    From mid-April to the present, more than 66,000 laborers throughout the province have gone to the mountains and factories to mine and build furnaces. Jinjiang, Minhou, Longyan, Longxi, Nanping, Xiamen and other places (cities) have newly built 285 small blast furnaces with a volume of less than 3 cubic meters. Jinjiang, Minhou, and Xiamen are still building 672 more. Nanping and Longyan regions are also stepping up the construction of 31 "small-scale indigenous groups" of coal mines.
    The masses in various places enthusiastically participate in this movement. In counties and communes with coal and iron resources, commune members have flocked to the mountains and factories to mine and build furnaces. Counties and communes without coal and iron resources have sent expeditionary forces to areas with coal and iron deposits to establish coal and iron production bases. Areas with existing iron plants and coal mines are also actively building a new batch of small blast furnaces and adding new coal mining faces.
    The large-scale construction of small blast furnaces and coal mines in various places has unleashed new power in production. Since May, coal and iron production in the province has risen sharply. After the Longyan region launched a county, commune, and street movement to vigorously develop coal and iron "small-scale indigenous groups," the average daily pig iron production in the first few days of May increased by 82% compared to April. In Datian County, six communes, including Taihua and Guangping, built 16 "small-scale indigenous groups" of coal pits, and the average daily coal production in April more than doubled that of March.
    Jiangxi
    Utilizing the Rural Busy Season Gap to Build More Than 200 New Earthen Blast Furnaces
    (Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang) Jiangxi Province has mobilized the masses to vigorously engage in the small-scale indigenous group iron smelting movement, and more than 100 newly built earthen blast furnaces in various places have been put into production. In early May, the province's daily pig iron production level increased by 13% compared to April.
    The recent small-scale indigenous group iron smelting movement in Jiangxi Province was launched by mobilizing the masses using the gaps in the rural busy season. Because the masses were mobilized in various places, a large number of small earthen furnaces were restored, rebuilt, and newly built within a few days. According to statistics, as of May 7, 285 small blast furnaces have been newly built in the province, with a total volume of more than 800 cubic meters, of which 102 have been put into production. The Yichun region mobilized the masses to build small earthen furnaces on a large scale, and the daily pig iron production level in early May increased by 93.5% compared to April. Yongxin County in the Jian region persisted in making a big effort with small earthen furnaces, and its daily production level has consistently remained at 100 tons. At the same time, all parts of the province have also transformed a number of medium and small blast furnaces based on possible conditions.
    While building iron smelting furnaces on a large scale, all localities have focused on the production of small coal pits and strengthened the transportation of ore and coal to ensure that the blast furnaces are well-fed.

    浙江福建江西大办小厂矿增产煤铁
    浙江
    以煤、铁为中心兴办各种小企业
    本报杭州18日电　一个以煤、铁为中心发展“小土群”、“小洋群”企业的群众运动，正在浙江全省煤炭、钢铁、采矿、电力、建筑材料、交通运输、化工等行业蓬勃开展。最近一个多月，全省已经发展了一批小高炉、小煤窑、小矿山等小型企业以及为煤、铁服务的土铁路、简易公路。
    在大办“小土群”、“小洋群”企业的群众运动中，各地都贯彻了土洋并举的方针，自力更生解决建炉、采矿的设备、材料、技术力量等方面的问题。嘉兴地区在建设小煤窑、小矿山时，用竹木代铁制造轨道、小斗车等设备，迅速提高了运输效率。各行各业都把支援“小土群”“小洋群”企业的建设，作为自己一项重要任务。金华地区在建设一批小煤窑时，工具、设备不够使用，许多厂矿立刻给予大力支援，机械厂等给小煤窑送去钢钎、钢锤、竹器厂突击编织运煤箩筐，加快了小煤窑的建设速度。
    为了高速度发展以煤、铁为中心的“小土群”、“小洋群”企业，各地、市、县委都建立了专门的领导机构，由第一书记或工业书记挂帅，从上到下，层层加强领导，制订规划，发动群众，根据就原料、就交通方便、就资源等原则，分期分批建设。金华地区各县人民公社都由党委书记挂帅，带领干部上山勘察矿藏，边探边采，迅速办起了一批小煤窑。

    六万多人上山下厂开采煤矿建设高炉
    据新华社福州电　福建省正在掀起一个规模巨大的大办小铁厂小煤矿的群众运动。
    从4月中旬到现在，全省已有六万六千多名民工上山下厂采矿建炉，晋江、闽侯、龙岩、龙溪、南平和厦门等地（市），已经新建三立方米以下的小高炉二百八十五座，晋江、闽侯和厦门正在新建的还有六百七十二座。南平和龙岩专区，还在加紧兴建三十一处“小土群”煤矿。
    各地群众热情昂扬地参加这一运动。有煤铁资源的县、社，社员们纷纷上山下厂采矿建炉；没有煤铁资源的县、社，派出远征军到有煤铁矿藏的地区建立煤铁生产基地。原来有铁厂、煤矿的地区，也在积极新建一批小高炉和新增采煤工作面。
    各地大建小型高炉和煤矿，已在生产上发挥了新的威力。5月份以来，全省煤铁产量急剧上升。龙岩专区掀起县、社、街道大办煤铁“小土群”运动后，5月份头几天的生铁平均日产量比4月份增长了82％；大田县太华、广平等六个公社建设了十六个“小土群”煤窑，4月份煤的平均日产量，比3月份增加一倍多。

    利用农村大忙的空隙新建二百多座土高炉
    新华社南昌电　江西省发动群众大搞小土群炼铁运动，各地有一百多座新建的土高炉投入了生产。5月上旬，全省生铁日产水平比4月份提高13％。
    江西省最近掀起的小土群炼铁运动，是利用农村大忙空隙发动群众开展起来的。各地由于发动了群众，在几天之内就恢复改建和新建了大批小土炉。据统计，到5月7日止，全省已新建小高炉二百八十五座，总容积达到八百多立方米，其中有一百零二座已经投入生产。宜春专区发动群众大建小土炉，5月上旬的生铁日产水平比4月份增长93.5％；吉安专区的永新县，坚持大闹小土炉，日产水平始终保持百吨。与此同时，全省各地还根据可能条件改造了一批中小高炉。
    在大建炼铁炉的同时，各地抓紧了小煤窑的生产，加强矿石、煤炭的运输工作，保证高炉吃好吃饱。
