Xinhua News Agency, Havana, April 30th. A delegation from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, headed by Li Zaiwen, attended a welcoming conference hosted by the Cuban Merchants’ Federation last night. The hall was decorated with Cuban and Chinese flags. The Cuban and Chinese national anthems were played at the opening of the conference. Head of the delegation, Li Zaiwen, spoke at the conference, emphasizing the friendship between the two countries. Representatives of the Cuban Merchants’ Federation presented portraits of Prime Minister Fidel Castro and the late rebel leader Camilo Cienfuegos to the Chinese guests.
    Representatives from trade unions of the World Federation of Trade Unions, the German Democratic Republic, and other countries also attended the conference.
    On the same evening, the delegation from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and other foreign guests also attended a "May Day" mobilization rally organized by the Cuban Workers' Federation in the suburbs of Havana, attended by two thousand people.
    Li Zaiwen spoke at the rally. He said to the Cuban workers: The Chinese trade union representatives are deeply impressed by the revolutionary enthusiasm of the Cuban people. He said that the friendship between the Chinese and Cuban people has a long history. As early as when the Cuban people, under the leadership of José Martí, began their war against Spanish colonial rule, the Chinese had already participated in their struggle. He said: The Cuban people are not isolated. Six hundred and fifty million Chinese people stand with them. The people of all socialist countries support them. Li Zaiwen said: The American imperialists occupy China’s territory of Taiwan, and they also send planes to Cuba to bomb sugarcane fields. His speech won warm applause.
    The delegation from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions was invited by the Cuban Workers’ Federation to attend the “May Day” celebration rally. Over the past few days, the Chinese guests, accompanied by their Cuban hosts, have visited several factories and cooperatives in the suburbs of Havana.
