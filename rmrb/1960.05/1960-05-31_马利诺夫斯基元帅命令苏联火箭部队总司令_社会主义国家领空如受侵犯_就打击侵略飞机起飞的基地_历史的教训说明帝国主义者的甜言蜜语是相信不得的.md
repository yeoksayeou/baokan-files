Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 30th: TASS reported from Moscow on the 30th: Marshal Malinovsky announced that, in his capacity as Minister of Defense of the Soviet Union, he had issued an order to the Commander-in-Chief of the Rocket Forces: If the airspace of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries is violated, strike the bases from which the invading aircraft take off.

The Soviet Defense Minister's statement was made today at a meeting in the Kremlin of advanced workers in the All-Union competition for the title of Communist Labor Brigade and Shock Worker, and was greeted with stormy applause. The meeting was attended by Soviet Communist Party and government leaders headed by Khrushchev.

The Marshal pointed out that this is a completely legitimate measure because we do not know what the invading aircraft is carrying. It may be carrying a hydrogen bomb. This will be the best condemnation of the American policy of aggression – to strike the aggressor's hand.

Marshal Malinovsky said that the advocates of the "Cold War" are trying, on the one hand, to "solve" international problems from a "position of strength," and on the other hand, they vainly hope to sit safely across the ocean and pull chestnuts out of the fire with other people's hands. However, those days are gone forever. The Marshal said that this will not work now. The Soviet Union has all the necessary means to give both the lackeys and the ringleaders the blows they deserve, no matter how far apart the oceans are. Malinovsky then said that this is by no means a threat. This is a warning. We have talked about this more than once, but what can we do? Sometimes we have to repeat the warning in order to stop the dangerous behavior of those who are blinded by arrogance and hatred.

Malinovsky said that the facts have overturned the Pentagon's gentlemen's reliance on American military superiority. The facts are that the United States is no longer a country that can do whatever it wants. The American allies in aggressive blocs such as NATO, CENTO, and SEATO, as well as the American people, are beginning to understand this. It is impossible not to consider this.

Speaking of the summit conference, Malinovsky pointed out that the Soviet Union had prepared a series of important proposals for study in Paris, aimed at clearing the way to peace and international cooperation among all countries. The destruction of the conference was the fault of the American warmongers, because they sent spy reconnaissance planes into Soviet territory.

Malinovsky called the U.S. Secretary of State's admission that the "U-2" plane was for espionage purposes a "Herter's shameless statement." Referring to Eisenhower's statement about stopping the piratical flights for several months, the Marshal said, "This statement is full of arrogance and recklessness. It is time to abandon these attitudes."

The Soviet Defense Minister said that modern radio technology means are capable of accurately determining where the aircraft came from, monitoring its flight, and determining its landing point. This means that no one can escape responsibility.

Malinovsky said that a beginning has already been made: a high-altitude aircraft dedicated to espionage purposes, which the Americans thought was untouchable, was shot down by Soviet rockets at the apex of its flight.

Malinovsky exposed the Pentagon's attempt to distort the truth about Powers' flight—insisting that the plane was shot down by Soviet artillery units at an altitude of less than 10,000 to 12,000 meters. Malinovsky said that all of this is just a bankrupt attempt to discredit the reputation of the Soviet air defense and to restore their confidence—believing that the "Lockheed U-2" aircraft will not be hit, which is very important for recruiting spies like Powers.

Malinovsky said: "But perhaps the gentlemen of the Allen Dulles organization really don't know about the anti-aircraft rockets possessed by the Soviet armed forces? Then, I will help them. Gentlemen, we have such rockets, and we have excellent rocket men. Our rockets can not only shoot down targets at an altitude of 20,000 meters, but also shoot down higher targets."

Malinovsky said, "Gentlemen, you do not yet have aircraft that cannot be hit by Soviet rockets, and you have not yet reached a height that cannot be reached by Soviet rockets. Sir, we sometimes think it is possible to reveal some of our secrets publicly."

Marshal Malinovsky said: The lessons of history tell us that imperialists cannot be believed, no matter what sweet words they say. The recent lesson of Camp David is very vivid and makes us unable to forget history. No, we do not believe the imperialists. We are convinced that they will attack the Soviet Union and other socialist countries as soon as they find an opportunity, but only because of the danger of the complete destruction of the imperialist system do they dare not act rashly.

Marshal Malinovsky said that we are ready to carry out any task assigned to us by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government. "When the heads of government gather together for peace talks, we do not get nervous or declare a combat alert. However, we are ready for battle. Please remember this, those who intend to carry out aggressive policies against the Soviet Union and other socialist countries."

### 马利诺夫斯基元帅命令苏联火箭部队总司令  社会主义国家领空如受侵犯  就打击侵略飞机起飞的基地  历史的教训说明帝国主义者的甜言蜜语是相信不得的

    马利诺夫斯基元帅命令苏联火箭部队总司令
    社会主义国家领空如受侵犯  就打击侵略飞机起飞的基地
    历史的教训说明帝国主义者的甜言蜜语是相信不得的
    新华社30日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科30日讯：马利诺夫斯基元帅宣布，他以苏联国防部部长身份向火箭部队总司令发出了命令：如果苏联和社会主义国家的领空遭到侵犯，就打击飞机起飞的基地。
    苏联国防部长这项声明是今天在克里姆林宫全苏争取共产主义劳动队和突击手称号竞赛先进者会议上发表的，这项声明受到暴风雨般的欢呼。参加会议的有以赫鲁晓夫为首的苏联共产党和政府领导人。
    元帅指出，这是完全合法的措施，因为我们不知道来犯的飞机带着什么东西，要知道，它也可能携带着氢弹。这将是对美国侵略政策的最好谴责——打侵略者的手。
    马利诺夫斯基元帅说，“冷战”的拥护者一方面企图从“实力地位”出发“解决”国际问题，一方面妄想在这种情况下能安然坐在大洋彼岸而假别人之手火中取栗。但是，这样的日子一去不复返了。元帅说，现在，这行不通了，苏联拥有一切必要的手段既能给仆从，也能给头目以应有的打击，不管他们远隔什么海洋。马利诺夫斯基接着说，这决不是威胁。这是警告。我们不只一次地谈到这一点，但是有什么办法呢，有时我们不得不重复警告，以便制止那些由于傲慢和仇恨而瞎了眼的人们的危险行为。
    马利诺夫斯基说，事实推翻了五角大楼的先生们仰仗美国军事优势的打算，这些事实就是：现在美国不再是可以为所欲为的国家了。北大西洋公约组织、中央条约组织、东南亚条约组织等侵略集团的美国盟国以及美国人民都开始懂得这一点。不考虑这一点是不行的。
    谈到最高级会议时，马利诺夫斯基指出，苏联曾经准备了一系列重要的建议供在巴黎研究，这些建议旨在扫清通向和平和各国国际合作的道路。会议遭到破坏是美国黩武主义者的罪过，因为他们向苏联境内派遣了间谍侦察飞机。
    马利诺夫斯基把美国国务卿的承认“U—2型”飞机抱着间谍目的的声明称作是“赫脱的厚颜无耻的声明”。元帅在谈到艾森豪威尔宣布的关于停止强盗式飞行几个月的声明时说，“在这项声明里，充满了骄横傲慢和狂妄轻率的态度。已经是抛弃这些态度的时候了。”
    苏联国防部长说，现代无线电技术手段有能力准确地确定飞机来自何方，监视它的飞行，并确定它的着陆地点。这就是说，要想逃避责任，是谁也办不到的。
    马利诺夫斯基说，已经有了一个开端：美国人认为打不到的、专用于间谍目的的高空飞机被苏联的火箭在飞机飞到高空顶点时打下来了。
    马利诺夫斯基揭穿了五角大楼企图歪曲鲍尔士的飞行真相——硬说飞机是在不到一万至一万二千米的高空被苏联炮兵部队击落的说法。马利诺夫斯基说，所有这些都不过是一种破了产的企图，即企图破坏苏联防空防御的名声，并企图恢复他们的信心——相信“洛克希德U—2型”飞机不会被打中，这对招募像鲍尔士那样的间谍是很重要的。
    马利诺夫斯基说：“但是，也许艾伦·杜勒斯机构的先生们真的不知道苏联武装部队拥有的高射火箭吧？那么，我来帮他们的忙。先生们，我们有这样的火箭，我们有出色的火箭手。我们的火箭不仅能够击落两万米高空的目标，而且能够击落更高的目标。”
    马利诺夫斯基说，“先生们，你们还没有拥有为苏联火箭所打不着的飞机，你们还没有达到为苏联火箭所达不到的高度。先生，我们有时认为可以公开我们的某种秘密。”
    马利诺夫斯基元帅说：历史的教训告诉我们，帝国主义者是相信不得的，不管他们讲的是什么甜言蜜语。最近的戴维营的教训非常鲜明，使我们忘记不了历史。不，我们不相信帝国主义者。我们深信，他们一找到机会就会进攻苏联和其他社会主义国家，只不过是由于有帝国主义体系彻底被毁灭的危险才使得他们不敢轻举妄动。
    马利诺夫斯基元帅说，我们准备着执行苏共中央和苏联政府交给我们的任何任务。“当政府首脑为举行和平会谈而聚会一起时，我们没有发神经病，没有宣布战斗警报。但是，我们是枕戈以待的，请那些蓄意对苏联和其他社会主义国家执行侵略政策的人记住这一点吧。”
