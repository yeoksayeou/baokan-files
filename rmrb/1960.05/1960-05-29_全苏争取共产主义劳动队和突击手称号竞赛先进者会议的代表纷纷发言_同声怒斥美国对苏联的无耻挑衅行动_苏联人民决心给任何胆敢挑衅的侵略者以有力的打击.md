Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 27th: At the All-Union Conference of Advanced Workers in the Socialist Labor Teams and Shock Workers Movement, participants unanimously and angrily condemned the shameless provocative actions of American imperialists against the Soviet Union, and exposed the crimes of the American ruling clique in undermining the Four-Power Summit Conference and creating international tensions.

Grishin, Chairman of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, said in his report to the conference: The intrusion of American spy planes into the Soviet Union and a series of shameless statements made by American government officials to justify this provocative incident have shown the people of the world that the words of the American ruling clique about peace are all lies to deceive the people. The Soviet working class and all working people unanimously support Khrushchev's statement in Paris and the solemn position taken by the Soviet government. The shameful conspiracy of the American government to undermine the Four-Power Summit Conference has been exposed to the people of the world. The Soviet people will express their gratitude to the Soviet Communist Party and government with a new surge of labor enthusiasm, and they will build their motherland even stronger. The Soviet people are determined to give a forceful blow to any aggressor who dares to provoke.

Shevelin, a miner from Donbass, said that all the miners in Donbass were extremely angry about the provocative behavior of American imperialists, and they unanimously condemned this shameless crime of American imperialism. Shevelin said that the Donbass miners fully supported Khrushchev's statement in Paris and warned those aggressors that if they dared to infringe upon the sacred territory of the Soviet Union, the Soviet people would give them a merciless blow.

Gaganova, a textile worker from Kalinin Oblast and a famous Soviet Hero of Socialist Labor, said that when the workers of Kalinin heard about the American imperialist spy plane intruding into Soviet airspace, flames of anger ignited in their hearts. She said:

	“We unanimously support the position of the Soviet government and fully support Comrade Khrushchev's statement in Paris. Let those provocateurs remember that no one in the world can stop the Soviet people from advancing!”

Noshedkin, a concrete component installer on the Abakan-Taishet Railway in the Krasnodar Krai, angrily warned the American imperialists: Siberians are the strongest, they love labor, and when necessary, they can also give the invading imperialists a fatal blow.

Perepadyatko, a construction worker from Bratsk, said at the conference that the capitalist world is collapsing. The Soviet people love their motherland, and they will never allow any aggressor's planes to fly into its skies. The vigilance of the Soviet people will never be relaxed, and the Soviet people will protect their motherland.

Stanilevich, a worker at the Moscow Railway marshalling station, Kulik, a Communist labor team leader from the Minsk Tractor Factory, Vasilyev, director of the Fourth Ball Bearing Factory in Kuibyshev, and Sosiekina, a young chicken farmer from Stavropol, also unanimously condemned the provocative behavior of American imperialists.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 27th: Many representatives attending the All-Union Conference of Advanced Workers in the Socialist Labor Teams and Shock Workers Movement have given interviews to the press, vehemently denouncing the American imperialists' acts of aggression against the Soviet Union.

Pertiyatko, the captain of the installation team at the Bratsk Hydroelectric Station, said that according to the instructions of my comrades, I must express to the conference our anger at the shameless arrogance of the American warmongers. We believe that everything Comrade Khrushchev said in Paris reflected our thoughts and feelings. We construction workers are the most peace-loving people, but 70% of the construction workers at the Bratsk Hydroelectric Station are former soldiers, and my work team is entirely composed of demobilized soldiers. Therefore, let those who are jealous of our strength and happiness and those who want to try their luck against us remember: those of us who wear construction workers' uniforms still have military uniforms hanging in our homes, and when needed, we can quickly change into military uniforms.

Usmanova, a cotton farmer from the Lenin Collective Farm in the Kanibadam District of Tajikistan, said that when I came to Moscow, my fellow villagers wanted me to be sure to see the exhibition of the wreckage of the American bandit plane. We cotton farmers express our deep anger at the treacherous behavior of the American aggressors.

Melkonyan, a Communist labor team leader from the Armenian Copper Mining Combine, on behalf of his labor team and all the youth of Armenia, said in "Pravda" that we are deeply enraged by the shameless provocations of the American warmongers, we express our indignation at Eisenhower's position on the Four-Power Summit Conference, we have mastered mining technology very well, but if necessary, we can also master modern military technology. Let the American generals keep these views of the Soviet workers in mind!

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 27th: The First All-Union Conference of Advanced Workers in the Socialist Labor Teams and Shock Workers Movement opened today in the Kremlin Palace of Congresses.

The conference was jointly convened by the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions and the Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League. The purpose of this conference is to summarize the experience of the competition movement and to determine the tasks for further developing this movement.

More than two thousand advanced workers from all over the Soviet Union in industry, agriculture, construction, and transportation are participating in the conference.

Khrushchev and other Soviet party and government leaders attended the conference.

Kozlov, member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the CPSU and Secretary of the Central Committee, delivered a congratulatory message to the conference on behalf of the Central Committee of the CPSU.

The congratulatory message pointed out that the movement for a communist attitude towards labor, which took shape on the eve of the 21st Congress of the CPSU, has in a short period of time turned into a huge economic and spiritual force, and currently more than five million urban and rural workers have joined this movement.

The congratulatory message said that the main characteristic of the competition for the title of Communist Labor Team and Shock Worker lies in the fact that this movement organically combines the struggle to achieve extremely high labor productivity on the basis of the latest science and technology with the work of educating new people—the masters of the country. This competition links labor, learning, and life together, and it has a positive impact on all aspects of people's lives and activities. It is an important factor in eliminating the essential differences between mental and physical labor.

The Central Committee of the CPSU pointed out that the basis of the guarantee put forward by the contestants is a communist attitude towards labor, and Lenin's principle of collectivism, "All for one, one for all," is becoming the norm of behavior for the Soviet people. The congratulatory message said that the outstanding initiatives of Gaganova and her thousands of imitators are vivid examples of the formation of a new communist attitude.

The Central Committee of the CPSU expressed its belief that the participants in the new movement will achieve higher labor productivity, they will more forcefully fight to complete the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule, and they will educate themselves with the excellent qualities of the people of the new society.

Grishin, Chairman of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, gave a report at the meeting on "The Tasks of Further Developing the Competition for the Title of Communist Labor Team and Shock Worker."

In his report, Grishin emphasized that the creative labor of millions of working people is a decisive factor in achieving these achievements, and the socialist competition that reflects the new attitude of the Soviet people towards labor is a clear manifestation of this.

Grishin mentioned that currently, more than 400,000 work teams, sections, work shifts, and workshops have participated in the competition for the title of Communist Labor Collective, and more than 40,000 collectives have won the lofty title of Communist Labor Team, and more than 100,000 workers have won the title of Communist Labor Shock Worker.

He pointed out that now, the entire collectives of large enterprises and construction sites have participated in the competition for the title of Communist Labor Collective.

The reporter said that communism is the tomorrow of our country. And now, the characteristics of the future and the shoots of communism are growing vigorously in all aspects of Soviet social life.

    全苏工会中央理事会主席格里申在向大会所作的报告中说：美国间谍飞机侵入苏联和美国政府负责人一系列为这一挑衅事件而作的无耻声明，向全世界人民表明了美国统治集团关于和平的言词全是欺骗人民的。苏联工人阶级和全体劳动人民一致支持赫鲁晓夫在巴黎所作的声明和苏联政府所采取的严正立场。美国政府破坏四国政府首脑会议的可耻阴谋已经暴露于全世界人民的面前了。苏联人民将以新的劳动热潮来表示对于苏联共产党和政府的感谢，他们将把自己的祖国建设得更加强大。苏联人民决心给任何胆敢挑衅的侵略者以有力的打击。

    加里宁州纺织女工、著名的苏联社会主义劳动英雄加干诺娃说，当加里宁的工人听到了美帝国主义间谍飞机侵入苏联领空以后，他们的心中都燃起了愤怒的火焰。她说：
  “我们一致拥护苏联政府的立场，并且完全支持赫鲁晓夫同志在巴黎的声明。让那些挑衅者记住，世界上没有任何人能够阻止苏联人民前进的步伐！”
    克拉斯诺达边疆区阿巴根—泰谢特铁路混凝土构件安装工诺谢德金愤怒地警告美帝国主义者说：西伯利亚人是最坚强的，他们爱好劳动，必要时也能给予进犯的帝国主义者以致命的打击。
    来自布拉次克的建筑工人佩列佳季科在会上说，资本主义世界正在溃灭中。苏联人民热爱自己的祖国，他们决不允许任何侵略者的飞机飞入它的天空。苏联人民的警惕性永远不会放松，苏联人民是会保护自己祖国的。

    布拉次克水电站安装工作队队长佩尔季亚季科说，根据我的同志们的嘱咐，我一定要向大会表达我们心中对美国黩武主义者厚颜无耻的狂妄行为的愤怒。我们认为赫鲁晓夫同志在巴黎说的一切都是反映了我们的思想感情的。我们建设者是最爱好和平的人，但是我们布拉次克水电站70％的建设者都是过去的战士，我的工作队就是完全由复员军人组成的。因此，让那些嫉妒我们的力量和幸福的人和那些想侥幸地同我们较量一下的人记住：我们这些穿着建设者工作服的人的家里还挂着军装，什么时候需要，我们换上军装是很快的。
    塔吉克卡尼巴达姆区列宁集体农庄植棉农乌斯马诺娃说，当我来莫斯科的时候，乡亲们都要我一定去看一下美国强盗飞机残骸展览会。我们植棉农对美国侵略者背信弃义的行为表示深深的愤怒。

    据新华社莫斯科27日电　第一次全苏争取共产主义劳动队和突击手称号竞赛先进者会议，今天在克里姆林宫会议大厅开幕。
    这次会议是由全苏工会中央理事会和苏联列宁共产主义青年团中央委员会联合召开的。这次会议的目的是总结竞赛运动的经验，并确定进一步开展这一运动的任务。
    参加这次会议的有来自全苏各地的两千多名工农业、建筑业和交通运输方面的先进工作者。

    贺词说，争取共产主义劳动队和突击手称号的竞赛的主要特点在于，这个运动把在最新的科学技术基础上争取达到极高的劳动生产率的斗争，同教育新人——国家的主人的工作有机地结合起来。这个竞赛把劳动、学习和生活联系在一起，它对人的生活和活动的一切方面产生积极的影响。它是消灭脑力劳动和体力劳动本质的差别的重要因素。
    苏共中央指出，竞赛者提出保证的基础，是对待劳动的共产主义态度，是列宁的“大家为一人，一人为大家”的集体主义原则，这一原则正在成为苏联人民行为的准则。贺词说，加干诺娃和她的成千上万的仿效者的卓越创举是形成新的共产主义态度的鲜明例证。
    苏共中央表示相信，新运动的参加者将达到更高的劳动生产率，他们将更有力地为争取提前完成七年计划而斗争，用新社会的人的优秀品质来教育自己。
    全苏工会中央理事会主席格里申在会上作了关于“进一步开展争取共产主义劳动队和突击手称号竞赛的任务”的报告。
    格里申在报告中谈到苏联人民在发展经济、文化方面所取得的成就时着重指出，千百万劳动人民群众的创造性劳动是取得这些成就的具有决定性意义的因素而反映苏联人民对待劳动的新态度的社会主义竞赛就是这方面的明显表现。
    格里申谈到，目前，有四十万个以上的工作队、工段、工作班和车间参加了争取共产主义劳动集体的称号的竞赛，已经有四万个集体获得了共产主义劳动队的崇高称号，有十万多名工人获得了共产主义劳动突击手的称号。
    他指出，现在，大企业和建筑工地的整个集体已经参加到争取共产主义劳动集体称号的竞赛中。
    报告人说，共产主义是我们国家的明天。而现在，未来的特征、共产主义的幼芽正在苏联社会生活各方面蓬勃地成长起来。
