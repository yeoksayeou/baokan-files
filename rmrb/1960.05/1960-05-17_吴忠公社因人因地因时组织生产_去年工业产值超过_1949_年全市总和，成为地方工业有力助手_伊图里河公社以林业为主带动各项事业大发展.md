    Wuzhong Commune Organizes Production According to People, Place, and Time
    Last Year's Industrial Output Value Exceeded the City's Total in 1949, Becoming a Powerful Helper for Local Industry
    Yitulihe Commune Takes Forestry as the Main Focus, Driving Great Development in Various Undertakings
    (Our dispatch) The street industry of the Wuzhong People's Commune in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, after rectification, consolidation, and improvement, has organized production in accordance with the principles of suiting the people, the place, and the time, and has become a powerful helper for local industry.
    The Wuzhong Commune currently has five commune-run factories. These factories, starting from scratch in March 1959, have accumulated more than 8,000 yuan in capital and added dozens of sewing machines and other machinery and equipment. They produce semi-finished products, finished products, or process raw materials in forty or fifty varieties. Last year, the output value created reached 250,000 yuan, which is 110,000 yuan more than the industrial output value of Wuzhong City in 1949.
    After these factories were established, under the leadership of the Party committee, they established fixed cooperative relationships with local state-owned factories, processing for local state-owned factories, and at the same time producing products needed for industrial and agricultural production and people's livelihoods. According to statistics, since the establishment of the factory, the Red Star Factory has processed more than 8,500 kilograms of woolen yarn for the local state-owned wool textile factory and spun 11,000 kilograms of rayon yarn for the local state-owned rayon factory; the Satellite Factory has sewn more than 2,800 pairs of shoe soles and pasted more than 7,900 backings for the local state-owned shoe factory; the five factories have also processed and sorted nearly 100,000 catties of rotten rope ends, supplying them to the local state-owned rayon factory as raw materials.
    The existing five factories of the Wuzhong People's Commune were reorganized from thirty-seven small factories. At the end of 1958, under the impetus of the Great Leap Forward and the People's Commune movement, the staff and workers' families and urban residents of Wuzhong City demanded to add bricks and tiles to socialist construction. Under the leadership of the Wuzhong Municipal Party Committee and the support of relevant units, they voluntarily raised more than 2,000 yuan (and some government relief funds), donated many production tools, and used civilian houses to set up thirty-seven small factories.
    In rectifying these factories, according to the principles of suiting the people, suiting the place, and suiting the time, the thirty-seven factories were merged into five larger factories: Red Flag, Red Star, Satellite, Leap Forward, and "March 8th". By suiting the people, it means arranging production items according to each person's expertise; by suiting the place, it means starting from filling gaps based on the needs of local industrial and agricultural production and people's lives, without competing with state-owned factories for raw materials, products, or markets, engaging in processing, repair, and service-oriented production, processing raw materials and producing semi-finished products for state-owned industries, and repairing furniture and sewing clothes for the masses; by suiting the time, it means organizing production activities according to seasonal characteristics, such as doing more weaving or participating in urban infrastructure construction in summer, and concentrating efforts on sewing cotton clothes and making cotton shoes in winter. In this way, street industry can more flexibly adapt to the needs of all aspects and fully exploit its potential to serve society.
    After determining the production and management policies and reorganizing the factories, the Wuzhong Municipal Party Committee sent five cadres to strengthen the leadership of these factories. The street management office under the commune has a Party committee secretary in charge of street industry. The industrial and transportation department of the municipal party committee also designated a cadre to be responsible for the planning, balancing, and business guidance of street industry. The municipal commercial departments supply the raw materials needed by the street industry, purchase the products of the street industry, and are responsible for price management.
    For more than a year, the Wuzhong Municipal Party Committee has continuously conducted socialist and communist education for the employees of the street industry, so that they can establish the ideas of loving labor, loving the country, and loving the collective, laying an ideological foundation for the consolidation and development of the street industry. At the same time, it correctly handled issues such as the accumulation and distribution, and wage benefits of the street industry.
    (Our dispatch) The Yitulihe People's Commune, organized around forestry enterprises in the Greater Khingan Mountains forest area of ​​Inner Mongolia, has implemented the policy of "forestry as the main focus, grasping production with one hand and life with the other" for the past year and a half. It has demonstrated unparalleled superiority and vitality in vigorously developing forestry production, comprehensively organizing the economic and cultural life of the people in the forest area, and changing the social landscape. Last year, the commune's timber production plan was completed in ten months; this year, it took only three months to complete the annual timber production plan. Last year, the commune was basically self-sufficient in vegetables, changing the situation of relying on foreign aid. At present, it has established more than fifty forest product industrial factories for comprehensive utilization of wood, seventy-one canteens, thirteen kindergartens and nurseries, one home for the elderly, and more than sixty large and small life service stations, as well as some health, cultural, and welfare facilities. Now, except for the old, the weak, the sick, and children, there are basically no idlers in the Yitulihe forest area.
    The establishment of the People's Commune laid a strong organizational foundation for implementing the policy of "forestry as the main focus". After the establishment of the commune, the Party committee first strengthened the education of the commune members on "forestry as the main focus, and striving to complete the various plans for forestry production ahead of schedule." Then, according to the needs of forestry production and various undertakings, it unified and rationally allocated labor. Strong male laborers were transferred to the front line of timber production in the mountains; women were assigned to forest product industries, canteens, commerce, and other service departments where physical labor was lighter. The commune Party committee correspondingly strengthened the leadership of organizing the people's economic and cultural life. It proposed to the commercial departments to implement the supply principle of "first the mountains, then the foot of the mountains," and organized more than eighty large and small service stations from towns to forest farms and work sections. When production was tense, the commune mobilized service departments to go up the mountains to support production, and stores and state-owned canteens also delivered goods and meals to the mountains. In addition, the commune also organized cultural troupes and film projection teams, and has large clubs, hospitals, middle schools, spare-time schools, libraries, cultural centers, etc., to ensure the cultural and recreational activities of the commune members.
    The commune members are constantly receiving the Party's education in various production and service organizations, and their collectivist and communist moral qualities are constantly growing. In residential areas, the phenomenon of "everyone sweeping the snow in front of their own door" and quarrels has disappeared, and mutual care and help have become the norm.

    吴忠公社因人因地因时组织生产
    去年工业产值超过1949年全市总和，成为地方工业有力助手
    伊图里河公社以林业为主带动各项事业大发展
    本报讯　宁夏回族自治区吴忠人民公社的街道工业，经过整顿、巩固、提高，因人、因地、因时制宜地组织生产，已经成为地方工业的有力助手。
    吴忠公社现有五个社办工厂。这些工厂从1959年3月白手起家地建立到现在，已经积累了八千多元资金，添置了几十部缝纫机等机器设备。生产的半成品、产品或加工的原料有四、五十种。去年创造的产值达二十五万元，比1949年吴忠市工业产值还多十一万元。
    这些工厂建立以后，在党委的领导下，和地方国营工厂建立了固定的协作关系，为地方国营工厂加工，同时生产工农业生产建设和人民生活需要的产品。据统计，从建厂到现在，红星厂已为地方国营毛纺织厂加工了八千五百多公斤毛线，为地方国营人造纤维厂纺了一万一千公斤人造纤维线；卫星厂给地方国营制鞋厂纳了二千八百多双鞋底，糊了七千九百多张褙子；五个厂还加工整理了近十万斤烂绳头，供给地方国营人造纤维厂作原料。
    吴忠人民公社现有的五个工厂是由三十七个小厂整顿改组而成的。1958年底，在大跃进和人民公社运动的推动下，吴忠市的职工家属和城市居民纷纷要求为社会主义建设增添一砖一瓦。在中共吴忠市委的领导和有关单位的支持下，他们自愿集资二千多元（还有部分政府救济款），献出许多生产工具，利用民房办起三十七个小工厂。
    在整顿这些工厂中，根据因人制宜、因地制宜、因时制宜的原则，把三十七个工厂合并组成红旗、红星、卫星、跃进、“三八”五个较大的工厂。所谓因人制宜，就是按照各人的特长安排生产项目；所谓因地制宜，就是根据当地工农业生产和人民生活需要，从拾遗补缺出发，不与国营工厂争原料、争产品、争市场，从事加工、修理和服务性的生产，为国营工业加工原料、生产半成品，为群众修理家具、缝补衣服；所谓因时制宜，就是按照季节特点组织生产活动，譬如夏天多搞编织或参加城市基本建设，冬天集中力量缝棉衣、做棉鞋。这样，街道工业就能够比较灵活地适应各方面的需要，充分发挥潜力，为社会服务。
    在确定生产经营方针和改组了工厂以后，吴忠市委又派五名干部，加强这些工厂的领导力量。公社下设的街道管理处有一个党委书记主管街道工业。市委工业交通部也指定一名干部负责街道工业的计划平衡和业务指导等工作。市商业部门供应街道工业需要的原料，收购街道工业的产品，负责价格管理。
    一年多来，吴忠市委不断地对街道工业的职工进行社会主义和共产主义的教育，使他们树立热爱劳动、热爱国家、热爱集体的思想，为街道工业的巩固和发展奠定了思想基础。同时，正确地处理了街道工业的积累与分配、工资待遇等问题。
    本报讯　内蒙古大兴安岭林区以林业企业为中心组织起来的伊图里河人民公社，一年半以来，贯彻执行了以林为主，一手抓生产一手抓生活的方针，在大力发展林业生产、全面组织林区人民经济、文化生活，和改变社会面貌等方面，发挥了无比的优越性和生命力。去年公社的木材生产计划，十个月时间完成的；今年仅用三个月的时间完成全年木材生产计划。去年全社蔬菜已基本自给，改变了依靠外援的局面。目前，办起的综合利用木材的林产工业工厂达五十多个、食堂七十一个、幼儿园和托儿所十三个、敬老院一所、大小生活服务站六十多个，还有一些卫生文化福利设施。现在伊图里河林区除了老弱病人小孩外，已基本上没有闲人。
    人民公社的成立，给贯彻执行以林为主方针奠定了有力的组织基础。公社成立后，党委首先向社员们加强了“以林为主，一切为提前完成林业生产各项计划而努力”的教育。然后又按照林业生产和各项事业的需要，统一合理地调配劳动力。强壮的男劳动力，调给山上木材生产第一线；妇女们被分配到体力劳动较轻的林产工业、食堂、商业和其他服务部门。公社党委相应地加强了组织人民经济、文化生活的领导。对商业部门提出贯彻执行
  “先山上后山下”的供应原则，并从城镇到林场、工段，组织了八十多个大小服务站。在生产紧张时，公社便调动服务部门上山支援生产，商店和国营食堂也送货送饭上山。此外，公社还组织了文工团、电影队，设有大俱乐部、卫生院、中学、业余学校、图书馆、文化馆等，保证了社员的文化娱乐活动。
    社员们在各种生产和服务组织中不断地受着党的教育，集体主义和共产主义道德品质不断增长。在居民区，个人自扫门前雪，吵架等现象已不见了，互相关心、互相帮助已成风尚。
