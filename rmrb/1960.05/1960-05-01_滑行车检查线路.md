    Gliding Car Inspection Line
    Copper wires suspended on utility poles can break over time. Once a wire breaks, long-distance communication is immediately interrupted. It is necessary to detect wire damage before the copper wire breaks.
    Previously, this line inspection work required several bamboo poles tied together, with four people lifting them from below, and one person climbing on top to work. After a day, people were exhausted, and progress was very slow. Line maintenance worker Xie Wenjun invented a gliding car. This gliding car consists of several wooden sticks and more than a dozen small iron wheels. The small iron wheels can be attached to the wires, and a person sits on the car and pulls the wires by hand, allowing the car to glide forward. People can sit on the car and inspect the wires with ease, eliminating heavy physical labor and increasing work efficiency by fifteen to twenty times. (Attached picture)

    滑行车检查线路
    悬挂在电杆上的铜线，日子久了会断；线一断，长途通信就马上中止。必须在铜线没有断以前把线伤检查出来。
    这项检查线路的工作，在以前要用几根竹竿绑在一起，由四个人在下面抬着，一个人爬在上面干。一天下来，人累得不行，进度还很缓慢。线路维护工人谢文君，发明了一种滑行车。这种滑行车由几根木棍和十几个小铁轮构成。小铁轮可以卡在线条上，一个人坐在车上用手牵动线条，车子便向前滑行。人可以很轻便地坐在车上检查线条，既消灭了笨重的体力劳动，又提高了工作效率十五倍至二十倍。（附图片）
