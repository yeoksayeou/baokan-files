Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 10th. Eight hundred thousand people from all walks of life in Tianjin held massive demonstrations and rallies in different districts this afternoon, firmly supporting the patriotic and just struggle of the Japanese people against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.

Starting at 11:00 a.m., people poured into various venues in groups from the streets and alleys. Along the way, people held red flags, carrying cartoons and banners, angrily shouting slogans such as "Oppose the U.S.-Japan reactionaries' conspiracy to plot a new war!" and "Oppose the revival of Japanese militarism!"

The mass rally held in the central square on the Haihe River bank was attended by 80,000 people. Leaders of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Hebei Provincial People's Committee, the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Tianjin Municipal People's Committee, as well as the provincial and municipal CPPCC, various democratic parties, and people's organizations attended the meeting.

The delegation of the Japan-China Friendship Association headed by Masuzo Akatsu, who arrived in Tianjin from Beijing today, also attended the meeting.

Zhang Chengxian, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, spoke at the meeting. He solemnly stated that the 43 million people in Hebei Province firmly support the patriotic and just struggle of the Japanese people against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, support the Japanese people's movement for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality, and resolutely oppose the revival of Japanese militarism.

Zhang Chengxian severely condemned U.S. imperialism for openly incorporating Japan into the U.S. aggressive military bloc and treating it as a U.S. atomic strategic base in order to intensify the revival of Japanese militarism. The signing of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty is an attempt to make Japan a source of war again, he said. The Chinese people and the people of Asian countries still have vivid memories of the inhuman atrocities of Japanese militarism. The people of Hebei Province will never forget the atrocities committed by Japanese militarism during its invasion of our country. We will never allow Japanese militarism to raise its head again.

Zhang Chengxian said that the heroic and unyielding struggle of the Japanese people against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty has dealt a heavy blow to the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries and made an important contribution to the cause of peace in Asia and the world. The 16th National Unified Action launched by the Japanese people on the 9th fully demonstrates the Japanese people's unyielding determination to fight against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. Zhang Chengxian emphasized that the struggle of the oppressed people will surely win, U.S. imperialism will surely be driven out of Japanese territory by the Japanese people, and the Kishida Nobusuke and his ilk who follow U.S. imperialism will surely end up with the same disgraceful end as Syngman Rhee and Lee Ki-poong.

Gao Shuxun, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, said at the meeting that the people of Hebei Province, like the people of the whole country, firmly stand with the Japanese people and will fight to the end to completely smash the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and defend peace in Asia and the world.

Masuzo Akatsu, head of the delegation of the Japan-China Friendship Association, spoke at the meeting. He said: We firmly believe that the comradely unity of the people of Japan, China, and Korea will become increasingly consolidated. On this basis, we are determined to fight to the end to smash the U.S.-Japan military alliance. Now, the struggle to prevent the ratification of the new U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, which is unfolding in Japan, has reached an unprecedented scale. The Japanese people are no longer the masses who were once oppressed by Japanese militarism. The ambitions of U.S. imperialism will inevitably be defeated in the face of the people's conscious struggle.

The grain inspection delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam headed by Nguyen Van Kinh, the delegation of the General Confederation of Labor of France headed by André Berteloot, the delegation of the General Confederation of Labor of Italy headed by Benia Bruno, as well as Soviet experts and Polish staff working in Tianjin, all attended the meeting today.

More than 700,000 people participated in simultaneous rallies held in various districts of the city. In Tanggu District and Xingang Wharf, 100,000 dockworkers, fishermen, shipbuilding workers, etc., held an unprecedentedly grand rally, at which they solemnly warned the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries: "Those who play with fire will perish."

Changchun 350,000 People Rally and Demonstrate Against the Revival of Japanese Militarism

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 10th. Three hundred and fifty thousand people from all walks of life in Jilin Province and Changchun City held a large-scale rally and demonstration this afternoon, firmly supporting the just struggle of the Japanese people against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.

Fifteen years ago, Japanese imperialism created a "Manchukuo" in Northeast China, with Changchun as its "capital," and carried out cruel enslavement of the people of Northeast China. The people from all walks of life who participated in the rally still have vivid memories of this heinous crime of Japanese fascism. They angrily shouted: "Oppose the revival of Japanese militarism!" "Down with U.S. imperialism!"

The people from all walks of life who participated in the rally and demonstration included workers, farmers, students, militiamen, and PLA soldiers.

He said that the people from all walks of life in Jilin Province and Changchun City resolutely support the patriotic and just struggle of the Japanese people against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and pay the highest respect to the heroic and unyielding Japanese people. He pointed out that the conclusion of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty is a long-planned action by the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries. The purpose of this treaty is to prepare for new aggression and war and is a serious provocation to the people of China, the Soviet Union, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and Asian countries. He said, The Chinese people have always regarded the struggle of the Japanese people against the U.S.-Japan reactionaries as a common struggle of the people of the two countries and regard supporting the patriotic and just struggle of the Japanese people as their sacred duty. The Japanese people, who have already won the support of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and peace-loving people all over the world, will surely thoroughly smash the evil conspiracy of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries and win the final victory as long as they continue to strengthen unity and persist in the struggle.

Fujikawa Yaeko, a representative of Japanese residents in Changchun who was invited to attend the meeting, spoke at the meeting. She thanked the people from all walks of life in Jilin Province and Changchun City for their support and encouragement to the Japanese people's struggle. She said that the Japanese people's anti-American and patriotic struggle will surely win the final victory with the support of peace-loving people all over the world, especially the 650 million Chinese people, and enable Japan to embark on the road of independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality.

The meeting concluded with the reading of a telegram from the people of all walks of life in Jilin Province and Changchun City supporting the just struggle of the Japanese people against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. After the meeting, the masses held a demonstration.
