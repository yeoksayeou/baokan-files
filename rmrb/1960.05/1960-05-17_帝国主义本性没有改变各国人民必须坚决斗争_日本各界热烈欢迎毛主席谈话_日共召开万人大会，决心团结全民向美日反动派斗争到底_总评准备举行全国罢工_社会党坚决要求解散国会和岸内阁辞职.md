Xinhua News Agency, 16th Dispatch from Tokyo: Japanese people from all walks of life warmly welcomed Chairman Mao Zedong's speech on the international situation made on May 14th in Wuhan when he received delegations from Japan, Cuba, Argentina, and other foreign countries, and expressed their determination to fight the US imperialism and Japanese reactionaries to the end.

    Japanese Communist Party Chairman Nozaka Sanzo told reporters today that the conclusion of a military treaty between US imperialism and Japanese militarism, as Chairman Mao pointed out, proves that the nature of imperialism has not changed.

    In expressing support for Chairman Mao's views, Nozaka Sanzo emphasized that the attempt of imperialism to launch a war can be prevented mainly due to the resolute struggle of the people of all countries in the world.

    Nozaka Sanzo said that the Japanese people are now engaged in an unprecedented large-scale struggle against the ratification of the new US-Japan "Security Treaty" and demanding the withdrawal of US troops from Japan. He said, "In the process of the struggle against this treaty, the unity of the Japanese people with the people of China and Korea has been greatly strengthened."

    Nozaka Sanzo expressed his gratitude to the Chinese people for supporting the Japanese people's struggle against the new US-Japan "Security Treaty." He emphasized that the Japanese Communist Party will be the vanguard of the Japanese people's struggle to drive US imperialism out of Japan and all other parts of Asia.

    Japanese Communist Party General Secretary Miyamoto Kenji emphasized that the convening of the East-West summit is another new achievement of the Soviet Union's policy of safeguarding peace, and at the same time, a reflection of the great progress made by the world people's peace movement.

    Miyamoto pointed out that the nature of US imperialism has not changed. On the one hand, it pretends to be "peaceful," while on the other hand, it uses U-2 aircraft to invade Soviet airspace to collect intelligence and sends aircraft and warships to invade Chinese airspace and territorial waters as many as ninety-six times. The US imperialist conspiracy to revise the US-Japan "Security Treaty" is a serious provocation to world peace.

    Miyamoto emphasized that the united strength of the people all over the world must be relied upon to smash this conspiracy.

    Miyamoto stated that the Japanese Communist Party will do its utmost to stand with the Japanese people against Eisenhower's visit to Japan in mid-June.

    Socialist Party National Movement Committee Chairman Tanaka Toshio pointed out that no one harbors illusions about US imperialism. The Japanese people regard it as the common enemy of the people of Japan, China, Korea, and other countries.

    Japan General Council of Trade Unions Political Department Director Yanagimoto Yoshio strongly condemned the two-faced policy of US imperialism. He also pointed out that it is necessary to strengthen the struggle of the people of all countries against US imperialism and reactionaries.

    Japan Women's Organizations Federation Chairman Kushida Fuki emphasized the need to strengthen the struggle against the ratification of the new "Security Treaty."

    Japan Peace Committee Director General Hirano Yoshitaro demanded that the summit meeting take measures to promote the realization of complete disarmament and the abolition of military bases in various countries. He pointed out that the actions of the Japanese and US reactionaries in concluding the new "Security Treaty" and reviving Japanese militarism are a threat to world peace and at the same time hinder the success of the summit meeting, which exposes the nature of imperialism.

    This newspaper reports, according to Xinhua News Agency: The Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party and the Tokyo Metropolitan Committee jointly held a massive "General Uprising Meeting to Stop the Ratification of the New Security Treaty, Support the Struggle of the South Korean People, Protest Against the US-Japan Government, and Demand the Dissolution of the Diet" in Tokyo on the 15th. More than ten thousand people participated in the meeting.

    After the chairman of the meeting, Japanese Communist Party General Secretary Miyamoto Kenji, announced the start of the meeting, he introduced in his speech Chairman Mao Zedong's remarks on the 14th to the Japanese delegation visiting China regarding China's firm support for the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle. All the participants warmly applauded to welcome it.

    Japanese Communist Party Chairman Nozaka Sanzo emphasized in his report that the Japanese people's struggle has been closely linked with the struggles of the people of China and Korea. Nozaka called on the Japanese people to be firm in their confidence and strive with all their strength for the victory of the struggle against the ratification of the "Security Treaty."

    Led by Nozaka and Miyamoto, all participants held a demonstration march on the streets.

    The Japan General Council of Trade Unions, which has 3.6 million members, held a meeting on the 15th and decided to further strengthen the struggle against the ratification of the new US-Japan "Security Treaty." The meeting decided that from May 17th to 19th, the General Council of Trade Unions will mobilize 5,000 people every day to petition the Diet, and on the 20th, hold strikes and rallies across the country to oppose the Diet's ratification of this treaty. A demonstration march will also be held in Tokyo that day. After the 21st, the trade unions will continue to petition the Diet every day.

    The leaders of local organizations of the Japan Socialist Party passed a resolution on the 15th, firmly demanding the dissolution of the Diet and the resignation of the most reactionary Kishi Nobusuke cabinet in postwar Japan. The Socialist Party also decided to submit this resolution to the Diet.

    日本共产党主席野坂参三今天对记者说，美国帝国主义和日本军国主义缔结军事条约这件事，正如毛主席所指出的那样，证明帝国主义的本性没有改变。
    野坂参三在表示支持毛主席的看法时强调说，帝国主义要想发动战争的企图所以能够被制止，这主要是由于世界各国人民的坚决斗争。
    野坂参三说，日本人民现在从事空前大规模的斗争，反对批准新日美“安全条约”，并且要求美国军队撤出日本。他说，“在反对这项条约的斗争过程中，日本人民同中、朝两国人民的团结已经大大地加强了。”

    日本共产党总书记宫本显治强调指出，东西方首脑会议的召开，是苏联维护和平政策的又一个新成就，同时是世界人民和平运动取得巨大前进的反映。
    宫本指出，但是美帝国主义的本质并没有改变，它一方面装出“和平”姿态，另一方面却以U—2型飞机侵犯苏联领空搜集情报，并且派遣飞机军舰侵犯中国领空领海达九十六次。美帝国主义修改日美
  “安全条约”的阴谋是对世界和平的严重挑衅。

  “阻止批准新安全条约、支援南朝鲜人民斗争、抗议美日政府、要求解散国会总奋起大会”。一万多人参加了大会。
