Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 1st: Five million Japanese people held rallies and demonstrations in over 800 locations nationwide today, warmly celebrating International Labor Day. This is the largest May Day celebration in Japan since the end of World War II.

A grand celebration was held in Tokyo. Six hundred thousand people crowded into the Meiji Jingu Gaien Square, where the rally was held. Representatives from the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and many mass organizations attended the rally.

Red flags fluttered in the venue, weaving a colorful ocean with the many placards and banners held high by the masses. The placards read: "Demand Complete Disarmament!" "Restore Sino-Japanese Diplomatic Relations, Achieve Peace in Asia!" "Syngman Rhee is Finished, Next is You, Nobusuke Kishi!" "Strive for the Return of Okinawa!" "Achieve a Society Without Unemployment!" Workers from the Tokyo Municipal Transportation Workers' Union and many other unions also carried a model of Kishi Nobusuke standing on a gallows.

At 10:00 AM, the chairman of the presidium of the conference, Kaoru Ota, Chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, announced the start of the celebration. He emphasized that the history of the working class struggle proves that all the enemy's conspiracies to divide workers' unity will inevitably be crushed.

Inejiro Asanuma, Chairman of the Socialist Party, Masaru Yoneji, Secretary-General of the Democratic Socialist Party, and Sanzo Nosaka, Chairman of the Japanese Communist Party, delivered speeches at the meeting.

Inejiro Asanuma pointed out that Japanese workers have continuously waged struggles and strengthened their strength in the fifteen years since the war, and workers have enough power to crush any conspiracy of the enemy.

Sanzo Nosaka emphasized that the more than 2,000 joint struggle organizations against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" that have been established successively throughout the country in the past year are a reliable force in preventing the ratification of the "Security Treaty" by the Diet and further striving for its abolition. Sanzo Nosaka called on Japanese workers to learn from the experience of the South Korean people's struggle, strengthen their confidence, and continue to launch struggles.

The conference unanimously adopted resolutions on fighting for improved living standards and working conditions, demanding the establishment of a social insurance system and basic labor rights, opposing the ratification of the new "Security Treaty," striving for disarmament, promoting the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, and demanding the dissolution of the Diet.

After the meeting, the 600,000 participants divided into five routes and held a massive demonstration and parade on the streets. The marching crowd sang "The Internationale." The loud singing resounded through the clear May sky.

When the parade passed the Diet building, the marching crowd shouted slogans such as "Dissolve the Diet!" and "The Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet Must Step Down!"

In Osaka, 230,000 people held a conference with placards opposing the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and overthrowing the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet. A water parade was also held locally. In the Kinki region, 630,000 people participated in gatherings held in 83 locations. In the Chubu and Hokuroku regions, 290,000 people also participated.

In rural areas such as Oguni Town in Niigata Prefecture, activities commemorating International Labor Day for the first time were held in rural areas. In Omuta City, the center of the Miike Coal Mine workers' struggle, a conference with 40,000 participants was held, and a demonstration was held.

    日本五百万人举行盛大示威游行
    东京六十万人集会反对日美条约要求岸信介内阁下台
    野坂参三号召日本工人学习南朝鲜人民经验继续斗争
    据新华社1日讯　东京消息：五百万日本人民今天在全国八百多处举行大会和示威游行，热烈庆祝“五一”国际劳动节。这是日本在第二次世界大战结束以来规模最大的一次庆祝“五一”节的活动。
    东京举行了盛大的庆祝大会。六十万人挤满了举行集会的明治神宫外苑广场。共产党、社会党和许多群众团体的代表参加了大会。
    会场上红旗林立，同群众高举着的许多标语牌和横幅织成了一片彩色的海洋。标语牌上面写着：“要求完全裁军！”“恢复日中邦交，实现亚洲和平！”“李承晚完蛋了，下一次是你岸信介！”“争取归还冲绳！”
  “实现没有失业的社会！”东京市交通工会和其他许多工会的工人们还抬着站在绞首台上的岸信介的模型。
    上午十时，大会主席团主席、日本工会总评议会议长太田熏宣布庆祝大会开始。他强调指出，工人阶级斗争的历史证明，敌人所有分裂工人团结的阴谋活动必然要被粉碎。
    社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎、民主社会党书记长曾弥益和日本共产党主席野坂参三分别在会上致词。
    浅沼稻次郎指出，日本工人在战后十五年来不断地展开了斗争，加强了自己的力量，工人有足够的力量粉碎敌人的任何阴谋。
    野坂参三强调指出，一年以来在全国相继成立的二千多个反对日美“安全条约”的共同斗争组织，是阻止国会批准和进一步争取废除“安全条约”斗争的可靠力量。野坂参三号召日本工人学习南朝鲜人民斗争的经验，坚定信心，继续展开斗争。
    大会一致通过了关于为争取提高生活水平和劳动条件而斗争、要求确立社会保险制度和劳动基本权利、反对批准新“安全条约”、争取裁军、促进恢复日中邦交、要求解散国会等决议。
    大会结束后，参加大会的六十万人分为五路到街上举行了声势浩大的示威游行。游行队伍高唱“国际歌”。嘹亮的歌声响彻5月晴朗的天空。
    当游行队伍路过国会大厦时，游行队伍高呼“解散国会！”“岸信介内阁快下台！”等口号。
    在大阪，有二十三万人举行了大会，大会上有反对新日美“安全条约”和打倒岸信介内阁的标语牌。当地还举行了水上游行。在近畿地方，有六十三万人参加了在八十三个地方举行的集会。在中部地方、北路地方也有二十九万人参加。
    在新潟县小国町等农村，第一次举行了农村纪念“五一”国际劳动节的活动。在三池煤矿工人斗争的中心大牟田市举行了有四万人参加的大会，并举行了示威游行。
