    “Six Hundred Million People Are All Yao and Shun”
    Guo Moruo

    (I) We dare to fight against the God of Death, we dare to fight against floods, we dare to fight against any exceptionally large natural disasters or man-made calamities, to make them bow their heads before us, to make them tremble before the style of communism!

    (II) The communist style is a leap from necessity to freedom. It demands putting politics in command, sacrificing oneself, overcoming difficulties together, and offering convenience to friends. For the cause of the Party, not only should one not care about rewards, but one should also be willing to contribute one's life, blood, and hands when necessary. Death, floods, exceptionally large natural disasters and man-made calamities should be non-existent in the eyes of heroes!

    (III) Look, we rescued Comrade Qiu Cai Kang, the furnace leader of the Shanghai Iron and Steel Plant No. 3, a comrade-in-arms striving to surpass the US and the UK on the iron and steel front. Although American authorities said that burns covering 70% of the body area were beyond rescue, Comrade Qiu Cai Kang's burn area exceeded 89%! However, Comrade Qiu Cai Kang was finally rescued, snatched back from the hands of the God of Death. We not only conquered death and broke superstitions, but also made foreign authorities lose face in the face of heroic deeds.

    (IV) Look, we rescued sixty-one class brothers in Pinglu County! They suffered food poisoning and urgently requested one thousand ampoules of dimercaprol from Beijing late at night. If they did not receive the medicine by dawn, the sixty-one class brothers would have to wait for death! Everyone mobilized, preparing everything, and ultimately relying on aircraft for the airdrop of medicine. The villages of Pinglu County are separated from Beijing by one thousand five to six hundred li. The location to be flown to in the night sky had no basic aviation equipment, yet the dimercaprol was accurately delivered, winning cheers of joy. The communist spirit united various departments on water, land, and in the air with class love into a thick red thread, pulling sixty-one class brothers from despair and finally bringing them back to life from the brink of death.

    (V) Look, we rescued the 12th train on the Beijing-Shenyang line, defeating the torrential floods that broke bridges and swallowed mountains! The young women of the "March 8th" Red Banner Carriage Group on the train, their average age was only around twenty. They fought tirelessly day and night in the encirclement of the flood for four days, ensuring that the sick, weak, elderly, and young on the train had food and drink, receiving unparalleled comfort, and finally received external assistance to break through the encirclement of the flood. "Treat the hunger of others as one's own, treat the drowning of others as one's own," the ancients once advocated such ideas. But how often in thousands of years have such actions been seen? These young women are truly worthy of the sages idealized by the ancients!

    (VI) Chairman Mao's verses say it well, "Six hundred million people are all Yao and Shun." People who have carried forward the communist style have realized this teaching. The heroic deeds of the past ten years can be written into the Twenty-Five Histories, truly "counting heroic figures, we still look to the present!" Heroes are everywhere, and everyone can become a hero, but you must put politics in command and first forget yourself.

    (VII) Working together wholeheartedly, without any calculations, six hundred million people with one heart, can truly make high mountains bow their heads, rivers give way, and the universe shrink! We must forever hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and sing and laugh loudly in the face of death and floods, in the face of any exceptionally large natural disasters or man-made calamities. We must forever accept the leadership of the Party, never waver, and build paradise on earth, which can be achieved at any time!

    “六亿神州尽舜尧”
    郭沫若
    （一）我们敢同死神搏斗，我们敢同洪水搏斗，我们敢同任何特大的天灾人祸搏斗，要使它们在我们的面前低头，要使它们在共产主义的风格面前发抖！
    （二）共产主义的风格是从必然跃进到自由，它所要求的是政治挂帅、牺牲自己，把困难协力克服，把方便送给朋友，为了党的事业，不仅不计报酬，有必要时甘愿贡献出自己的生命、鲜血、双手。死神，洪水，特大的天灾人祸，在英雄们的眼中应该是根本没有！
    （三）请看，我们抢救了上钢三厂的炉长丘财康同志，这位在钢铁战线上争取超美超英的战友。尽管美国权威说：烫伤面积占70％便没有救，而丘财康同志的烫伤面积却超过了89％！然而丘财康同志终于抢救回来了，抢救自死神之手。我们不仅征服了死神，破除了迷信，而且使外国权威在英雄事业面前丢了丑。
    （四）请看，我们抢救了平陆县的六十一个阶级兄弟！他们食品中毒向北京急求二巯基丙醇一千支，已经是晚间，如天明得不到药品救济，六十一个阶级兄弟便只好等待着死！大家动员了起来，准备就一切的一切，而最后空投药品还必须仰仗着飞机。平陆县的乡村和北京相隔一千五六百里，夜空中要飞向的地点并无基本的航空设备，竟准确地投送到二巯基丙醇嬴得欢天喜地。共产主义精神把各个部门在水上、陆上、空中，用阶级友爱拧成了一条粗大的红丝；挽着六十一个阶级兄弟从绝望中终于回生起死。
    （五）请看，我们抢救了京沈线上的第12次列车，战胜了冲断桥梁，吞食山陵的滔天洪水！列车上的“三八”青年红旗包车组的女青年们，她们的平均年龄只有二十来往岁。在洪水的包围中日夜不休地搏斗了四天，使车上的病弱老幼有吃有喝，得到无比的安慰。而终于得到外应突破了洪水的重围。人饥己饥，人溺己溺，古人曾有过这样的鼓吹。但是几千年来几曾见过有这样的行为？这些女青年们真和古人所理想的圣贤无愧！
    （六）毛主席的诗句说得好，“六亿神州尽舜尧”，发扬了共产主义风格的人们实现了这个教导。十年来的英雄事迹可以写成二十五史，真正是“数英雄人物，还看今朝”！遍地都是英雄，人人都可以成为英雄，但就要你政治挂帅，首先把你自己忘掉。
    （七）通力合作，毫无计较，六亿人民心一条，真可以使高山低头，江河让路，宇宙缩小！我们要永远高举起毛泽东思想的红旗，在死神和洪水的面前高歌而欢笑。在任何特大的天灾人祸面前高歌而欢笑。我们要永远接受党的领导，决不动摇；把天堂建设在人间时刻都可以做到！
