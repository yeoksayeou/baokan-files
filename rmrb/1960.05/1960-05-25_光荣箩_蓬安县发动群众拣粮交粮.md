Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu Electric Dispatch: During the summer harvest, rural public canteens in Peng'an County, Sichuan Province, universally established "Glory Baskets," mobilizing commune members to hand in the grain they gleaned from the fields and roadsides. This created a surge of everyone collecting grain and everyone handing in grain. The entire county collected more than 110,000 catties of grain in just three days.

In order to achieve a quick and clean harvest and a full harvest of high yields, Peng'an County organized elderly, weak, and child laborers to specialize in gleaning grain, and also launched a mass gleaning movement. The method was to place baskets in the canteens, with the four characters "Gleaning Grain is Glorious" written on red paper on the baskets. Commune members conveniently put the gleaned grain into the baskets when eating, and kept records by person and by number of times, paying a certain reward. Those who gleaned a lot of grain were also praised and encouraged. In addition to setting up "Glory Baskets" in the canteens, some communes and management districts also set up temporary "Glory Baskets" on slopes and field edges to facilitate the masses in gleaning and handing in grain on the spot.

    “光荣箩”
    蓬安县发动群众拣粮交粮
    据新华社成都电　四川省蓬安县各农村公共食堂在夏收期中，普遍设立“光荣箩”，发动社员把他们从地里、路边拣的粮食，交到“光荣箩”里，形成了人人拣粮，个个交粮的热潮，全县仅三天时间就拣回粮食十一万多斤。
    蓬安县为了做到快收收净、丰产全收，各地除组织老弱劳力和儿童专门拣粮外，并开展了全民性的拣粮运动。办法是在食堂里放箩筐，筐上用红纸写上“拣粮光荣”四个大字，社员们把拣到的粮食，在吃饭时顺便投入箩内，按人分次记账，付给一定报酬，拣粮多的还给以表扬鼓励。有的公社和管理区除了在食堂设立“光荣箩”以外，还在坡上、地边设置临时“光荣箩”，以方便群众就地拣就地交。
