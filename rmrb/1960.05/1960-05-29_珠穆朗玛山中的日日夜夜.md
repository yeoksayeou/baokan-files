Days and Nights on Mount Everest
Guo Chaoren

Mount Everest, the world's highest peak, has strongly attracted people's attention for many years. Its steep rocks tower into the distant sky, milky white clouds float at its feet, deep valleys are filled with boundless primitive glaciers, and towering mountain ranges are covered with snow accumulated for thousands of years. Sometimes, howling whirlwinds darken the sky and earth; sometimes, huge avalanches shake the earth and mountains…

For nearly half a century, British expeditions have traveled across the oceans many times, attempting to climb its summit from the north route of this giant mountain, but each climb ended in failure. Climbing Mount Everest from the north slope is considered by Western mountaineers to be a hard to reach "mysterious area" on earth.

But today, in the "difficult to climb" area above 8,000 meters above sea level on the north route of Mount Everest, Chinese mountaineering athletes have set up silver tents; in the "avalanche" area of Mount Everest, known as the "white death," Chinese mountaineering athletes have blazed a trail to the summit; on the summit of Mount Everest, known as "where no birds can pass," Chinese mountaineering athletes have left human footprints.

In order to completely uncover the secrets of Mount Everest, Chinese mountaineering athletes spent many fighting days and nights in the unpredictable mountains of Mount Everest…

        Mountain Lights

It was late at night, and snow was blowing under Mount Everest.

The lights in most of the tents in the mountaineering team's base camp were already off, and the team members had long since burrowed into their cold-proof down sleeping bags.

However, in a tent in the center of the base camp, the lights were still brightly lit, and there was a hubbub of voices. Around a "square table" made of wooden boxes used for canned food, a group of people were intently discussing something.

This was the mountaineering team headquarters holding a meeting.

Sitting in the middle was a sturdy middle-aged man—Shi Zhanchun, the captain and Party Secretary of the mountaineering team. He is one of China's outstanding mountaineers. In recent years, he has led the young Chinese mountaineering team more than once to conquer many dangerous peaks, and has won honors for the motherland many times. He has been attacked by avalanches and has fallen off dangerous ice rocks. Hardship cannot frighten him, and death cannot threaten him. Shi Zhanchun listened quietly to other people's speeches, while also asking various questions from time to time, and writing down other people's opinions in a notebook.

Sitting opposite Shi Zhanchun was Xu Jing, the deputy captain of the mountaineering team and a sports athlete. Judging from the surface, it is impossible to imagine that this "weak" young man is a tiger general in China's mountaineering sports circles. He rarely speaks, and only buries himself in hard work. In every mountaineering activity, Xu Jing almost always undertakes the difficult task of scouting routes and opening up the way forward for the team.

Xu Jing had just reported on the situation of the "North Col" route scouted by the reconnaissance team he led. Now, the team headquarters had to study and select the safest route to the North Col based on the information they had scouted. The top of the North Col is 7,007 meters above sea level, and it is completely a "world of ice and snow." Snow accumulated for ten thousand years and huge ice walls blocked the mountaineers' way. In the past, many foreign expeditions have run into walls at the North Col. Therefore, this section is regarded as the first hurdle in climbing Mount Everest.

The leading cadres of the team headquarters carefully studied the topographic map, exchanged opinions in a low voice, and finally adopted the reconnaissance team's suggestion and selected the best route from the four routes. Although this route requires crossing four ice cracks and four very steep ice slopes, it can avoid the danger of "ice collapses" and "avalanches." The meeting also estimated all possible situations on this route, discussed a series of safety measures to ensure the smooth passage of the mountaineering team, and conquer the North Col.

Gusts of wind and snow drilled in from the cracks in the tent, and gusts of biting cold wind caused the lights to flicker on and off. People continued to discuss, from the overall mountaineering activity plan to the details of life, all were carefully studied and appropriate arrangements were made.

Although these leading cadres worked all day long, they wanted so much to lie down and rest at this time, but they knew that if they rested one minute less, the work of the entire mountaineering team would improve one step. Because the task assigned to them by the people of the motherland was so glorious and so arduous, and when they thought of this, they became energetic again.

        Urgent Report

In the base camp, people gathered around a huge weather map.

On the weather map, a series of black curves representing low-pressure cold waves moved from the distant Arctic Circle to the Central Asian continent, and then to the undulating Himalayan mountains.

Various meteorological instruments indicated that in twenty-four hours, the area above 7,000 meters above sea level on Mount Everest would be hit by a level nine gale and blizzard, and the temperature would drop to minus thirty or forty degrees Celsius.

However, the mountaineers who had gone up the mountain two days ago were, according to plan, just about to depart from the camp at 6,400 meters above sea level to the area above 7,000 meters above sea level in twenty-four hours.

Bad weather would bring unpredictable consequences to the mountaineers.

The comrades at the base camp immediately mobilized urgently and had to find a way to quickly transmit the forecast to the mountain.

The radio operator began to make urgent contact with the camp at 6,400 meters above sea level at the scheduled contact time. However, in addition to the "crackling" sound of static friction in the air, no reply from the other radio station could be heard. The radio operator, Luo Jiaqiao, anxiously tapped the key, calling the other party's call sign for a long time. He no longer cared about the cold and fatigue. He knew how important this telegram was to the comrades-in-arms on the mountain. The scheduled contact time passed, and Luo Jiaqiao's fingers changed from soreness to numbness, but he still did not hear the other party's reply. Based on his long-term experience in high-altitude work, he thought that if only the other party's transmitter was out of order and the receiver was intact, it might be possible to receive his telegram. Therefore, he sat in front of the transmitter without discouragement, calling out while sending the content of the telegram:

"Attention! Attention! The weather in the area above 7,000 meters will deteriorate in the next twenty-four hours..."

In order to ensure that the other party could accurately copy, Luo Jiaqiao repeatedly sent each code several times without being bothered. How much he hoped that his labor would bring peace and victory to his comrades-in-arms on the mountain...

Despite this, the comrades at the base camp were still worried, what if the radio station on the mountain could not receive it? The next day before dawn, Communist Youth League members Wei Guangfu and Tan Keyuan set off against the wind and snow. They were going to walk to the camp at 6,400 meters above sea level to deliver the weather forecast to their comrades-in-arms. From the base camp at 5,120 meters above sea level to the camp at 6,400 meters above sea level, the height to be ascended was nearly 1,300 meters, passing through steep mountain ridges and dangerous glacier areas, with a total distance of more than 17 kilometers. On weekdays' normal marches, mountaineers need to walk for three days. But these two young men, who grew up in the plains of Jiangnan and were less than twenty years old, were determined to complete the three-day journey in one day with ice axes on their backs.

Their breathing became more and more difficult, and their legs became heavier and heavier. Golden stars burst into their eyes, and sweat dripped from their foreheads.

The biting whirlwind rolled up the vast granular snow and hit them in the face. Before they had time to turn around, they were knocked to the ground by the wind and snow.

It was getting dark, and Wei Guangfu and Tan Keyuan were cold, tired and hungry, fell down, got up, fell down again, and got up again. They endured the soreness all over their bodies and walked step by step. They thought that even if their feet could not be lifted, they would have to crawl to the side of their comrades with both hands.

When they arrived at the camp at 6,400 meters above sea level, it was already midnight, and the wind and snow were even greater. They handed the weather forecast to their comrades-in-arms with their own hands. They hardly had the strength to speak, but a victorious smile appeared on their lips.

Before they arrived, although the comrades at the camp at 6,400 meters above sea level had already received the news from the radio and made arrangements, they still expressed the greatest respect and gratitude for the arrival of these two young comrades-in-arms.

        Pioneers

The vast clouds covered the top of the North Col, and on the steep ice slope, gusts of wind rolled up dense clouds of accumulated snow.

Several black figures were moving with difficulty in the wind and snow. These were the mountaineering team's reconnaissance team members who were opening up a safe passage to the top of the North Col for the team. The North Col is a cliff on the north slope of Mount Everest, standing between the north peak and the main peak of Mount Everest. The 400-meter-long ice slope blocks people's way like a city wall. On its ice slope, there are countless trough marks of avalanches, and huge ice and snow avalanches occur almost every year. In the ice and snow of the North Col, the bodies of foreign "explorers" have fallen more than once in the past thirty years.

To reach the summit of Mount Everest, one must first break through the "difficult pass" of the North Col.

A reconnaissance team composed of six outstanding mountaineers, including athletes Xu Jing, Peng Shuli, and Liu Lianman, braved the harsh weather in Mount Everest and set off towards the North Col.

To find a path to the main peak on unpredictable ice, snow, and rocks, there is no guide, because almost no one has ever walked here; there is no map, because no geographer has ever surveyed it. Only rely on the reconnaissance team's eyes to find a safe area; only rely on the reconnaissance team's feet to step out a path from the ice and snow....

The reconnaissance team members, holding ice axes and tying sharp crampons on the soles of their shoes, climbed one after another. Reconnaissance here can be dangerous at any time. If you do not pay attention to maintaining the center of gravity of your body, a whirlwind will roll you to the bottom of the rock dozens of feet deep, and your body will be crushed to pieces; if you do not pay attention to choosing the route under your feet, if you fall into a deep ice crack, even your shadow will not be found; if you do not recognize the terrain, a heavy avalanche will bury you. However, the brave reconnaissance team members protected each other, helped each other, used various mountaineering techniques, and advanced at a speed of 80 meters per hour.

The wind and snow became even greater. The gale blowing from high altitude hit the rock walls of the main peak and the north peak, revolving and tumbling with ice chips and granular snow at a speed of 30 to 40 meters per second.

The reconnaissance team members were wearing high-quality down clothing, and special cold-proof hats and gloves, but still felt the biting cold. In order to seize the opportunity and open up the road for the team, the reconnaissance team members did not care about resting, and still braved the wind, and prostrated themselves on the ice to persist in advancing to the top of the North Col.

Now, they came to an ice crack. This ice crack is narrow, deep, and has a slope of more than 70 degrees, like an "alley." One must climb from the bottom of this "alley" to reach the top of the North Col.

Athletes Xu Jing and Peng Shuli used their backs to lean against one side of the "ice alley," and their feet to step on the other side of the "ice alley," using the most complicated climbing techniques, moving upward inch by inch. This action requires the use of the whole body's strength. In less than two or three minutes, their whole bodies were soaked in sweat, and their breathing became rapid. Without a strong will, just a slight relaxation would cause them to fall down. They gritted their teeth and persevered in climbing upward second by second. This "ice alley," less than thirty meters high, actually took them a full hour to climb up.

When they reached the top of the North Col, it was already dark. Only then did they remember that they had been fighting in the wind and snow for more than ten hours, without eating, without drinking water, enduring the cold, and enduring the fatigue, but finally successfully found an absolutely safe route and opened the first pass to climb the summit of Mount Everest.

    珠穆朗玛山中的日日夜夜
    郭超人
    世界上的最高峰——珠穆朗玛峰，多少年来强烈地吸引着人们的注意。它那陡峻的山岩高耸在遥遥的天际，乳白色的浮云飘游在它的脚下，纵深的峡谷里倾泻着一望无垠的原始冰川，巍峨的山岭上复盖着积存万年的白雪。有时，嘶叫的旋风刮得天昏地暗；有时，巨大的雪崩震撼得地动山摇……。
    近半个世纪以来，英国的探险队多次远涉重洋，试图由这座巨山的北路攀上它的峰巅，但每次攀登都宣告失败。从北坡攀登珠穆朗玛峰，被西方登山者认为是地球上一个难以接近的“神秘地区”。
    但是，今天，在珠穆朗玛峰北路“难以攀登”的拔海八千米以上的地带，中国登山健儿们搭起了一座座银色的帐篷；在被称作“白色死神”的珠穆朗玛“雪崩”区域，中国登山健儿们踩出了通向顶峰的大道；在被称作“飞鸟也不能通过”的珠穆朗玛顶峰上，中国登山健儿们留下了人类的足迹。
    为了彻底揭开珠穆朗玛峰的秘密，中国登山健儿们在珠穆朗玛峰变幻莫测的山岭间，度过了多少个战斗的日日夜夜……。
        山地灯火
    深夜了，珠穆朗玛山下风雪弥漫。
    登山队大本营绝大部分帐篷里灯火已经熄灭，队员们早就钻进了能御严寒的鸭绒睡袋。
    但在大本营正中的一座帐篷里，仍然灯火通明，人声喧闹。在用装罐头的木箱堆成的“方桌”周围，一堆人正聚精会神地商量着什么。
    这是登山队队部在开会。
    坐在正中间的，是一位身体结实的中年人——登山队队长兼党委书记史占春。他是我国优秀的登山运动员之一，几年来曾不止一次地率领年轻的中国登山队，征服了许多座险峻的山峰，多次为祖国争得了荣誉。他遭受过雪崩的袭击，掉下过危险的冰岩。艰险吓不倒他，死亡威胁不了他。史占春一边静听着别人的发言，同时也不时地提出各种问题，并把别人的意见记到笔记本上。
    坐在史占春对面的是登山队副队长、运动健将许竞。如果从表面上看，怎么也不能想像这个“文弱”的青年人，却是我国登山运动界的一员虎将。他很少讲话，只会埋头苦干。在每一次登山活动中，许竞几乎都担负着侦察路线和为大队开辟前进道路的艰难任务。
    许竞刚刚汇报了由他率领的侦察组侦察“北坳”路线的情况。现在，队部要根据他们侦察的资料，研究并选择一条通往北坳的最安全的路线。北坳顶端拔海七千零七米，这里完全是“冰雪世界”，万年积雪和巨大的冰墙，挡住登山者的去路。过去，许多外国探险队都在北坳碰了壁。因此，这一地段被视为攀登珠穆朗玛的第一道难关。
    队部领导干部们仔细地研究着地形图，低声地交换着意见，最后终于采纳了侦察组的建议，从四条路线中选择出一条最好的路线。这条路线虽然要越过四条冰裂缝和四段很陡的冰坡，但可以避免“冰崩”和“雪崩”的危险。会议还估计了在这条路线上可能发生的一切情况，讨论了一系列的安全措施，保证登山队顺利通过，征服北坳。
    阵阵风雪从帐篷缝隙钻进，一股股刺骨的寒风使灯光吹得忽明忽暗。人们继续讨论着，从全面的登山活动计划到生活小节，都进行了认真的研究，并作出了恰当的安排。
    这些领导干部虽然白天整天都在工作，这时候也多么想躺下来休息休息，但他们知道，他们几个人少休息一分钟，整个登山队的工作就会提高一步。因为，祖国人民交给他们的任务，是这样光荣又这样艰巨，他们一想到这里，就又精神抖擞了。
        急　报
    在大本营里，人们围聚在一张巨幅的天气图前。
    天气图上，一道道黑色曲线表示的低压寒潮，从遥远的北极圈移到了中亚细亚大陆，又移到了绵延起伏的喜马拉雅山区。
    各种气象仪表指示，二十四小时以后，珠穆朗玛峰拔海七千米以上的地区，将刮起九级狂风和暴雪，气温将下降到摄氏零下三、四十度。
    可是，两天前已经上山的登山队员们，根据计划，正巧将在二十四小时以后，从拔海六千四百米的营地出发到拔海七千米以上的地带。
    恶劣的天气会给登山队员们带去难以预料的后果。
    大本营的同志们顿时紧急动员起来，必须想办法把预报迅速传送到山上去。
    无线电报务员在预定的联络时间，开始同拔海六千四百米的营地进行紧急联系。但是，天空中除了静电摩擦的“劈拍”声外，听不到对方电台的回答。报务员罗家谯焦灼地敲着电键，长时间地呼叫着对方的呼号。他已经顾不得寒冷和疲倦。他知道，这次电报对山上的战友们有着多么重要的意义。预定的联络时间过去了，罗家谯的手指从酸痛变成麻木，但他仍然没有听见对方的回答。凭着长期的高山工作经验，他想，如果对方只是发报机失灵而收报机是完好的，就有可能收到他的电报。因此，他毫不灰心地坐在发报机前，一边呼叫，一边拍发电报的内容：
    “注意！注意！未来二十四小时内，七千米以上地区天气将要恶化……”
    为了使对方能准确地抄收，罗家谯不厌其烦地将每一个电码重复拍发了好几遍。他多么希望，他的劳动将能给山上的战友们带去平安和胜利……。
    尽管这样，大本营的同志们仍然放心不下，万一山上的电台收听不到呢？第二天天不亮，共青团员魏广福和谭克元，就顶着风雪出发了。他们要步行到拔海六千四百米的营地，把天气预报送给战友。从拔海五千一百二十米的大本营到拔海六千四百米营地，上升的高度将近一千三百米，中间要经过陡峻的山脊，危险的冰川地带，全程达十七公里多。登山队员们在平日的正常行军中，需要走三天。但这两个从小生长在江南平原上、不到二十岁的青年人，今天却背着冰镐，决心在一天内走完三天的路程。
    他们的呼吸愈来愈困难了，双腿愈来愈沉重了。他们的眼前迸散着金星，汗水从他们的额头淌下。
    刺骨的旋风卷起茫茫的粒雪迎面打来，他们来不及转身就被风雪卷倒在地上。
    天黑了，魏广福和谭克元又冷又累又饿，跌倒了，爬起来，又跌倒了，再爬起来。他们忍受着满身的酸痛，一步一步走去。他们想，即使脚抬不起，用两只手也要爬到同志们的身边。
    当他们到达拔海六千四百米营地时，已经是子夜时分，风雪刮得更大了。他们把天气预报亲手交给了自己的战友，他们几乎连说话的力气都没有，但是他们的嘴边显出了胜利的微笑。
    在他们到达以前，虽然在拔海六千四百米营地上的同志已经从无线电报里收到了这个消息，做好了安排，但对这两位青年战友的到来，仍然表示了最大的尊敬和感谢。
        开路先锋
    茫茫的云雾遮盖着北坳的顶端，陡峭的冰坡上，阵阵狂风卷起了密云般的积雪。
    几个黑色的人影，正在风雪中艰难地移动。这是登山队的侦察队员们在为大队开辟安全通向北坳顶部的道路。北坳是珠穆朗玛峰北坡上的一道峭壁，矗立在珠穆朗玛峰北峰与主峰之间，四百米长的冰坡使它像城墙一样挡住人们的去路。在它的冰坡上，隐藏着无数雪崩的槽印，几乎每年都发生过巨大的冰雪崩。近三十年来，北坳的冰雪中不止一次地倒卧过外国“探险家”的尸体。
    要登上珠穆朗玛顶峰，首先要攻破北坳这座“难关”。
    运动健将许竞、彭淑力、刘连满等六名优秀登山运动员组成的侦察小组，冒着珠穆朗玛山中恶劣的天气，向北坳进发了。
    在不测的冰雪和岩石上寻找一条通向主峰的道路，没有向导，因为这里几乎没有人走过；也没有地图，因为还没有地理学家对它进行过绘测。只有依靠侦察队员的双眼，找到安全的地带；只有依靠侦察队员的双脚，从冰雪中踩出道路……。
    侦察队员们拿着冰镐，鞋底上绑着尖利的冰爪，一个跟着一个，向上攀登。在这里进行侦察，随时都可能遇到危险。如果不注意保持身体的重心，一阵旋风会把你卷到几十丈深的岩底，粉身碎骨；如果不注意选择脚下的路线，掉进纵深的冰裂缝，就连人影都找不到；如果不认清地形，沉重的雪崩会把你埋葬。但是，勇敢的侦察队员们彼此保护，彼此帮助，采用各种登山技术，以每小时上升八十米的速度前进着。
    风雪更大了。从高空刮下的暴风，撞击着主峰和北峰的岩壁，带着冰渣和粒雪以每秒三、四十米的速度回旋着，翻滚着。
    侦察队员们穿着高质量的鸭绒衣裤，戴着特制的防寒帽和手套，仍然感到严寒刺骨。为了争取时机，给大队开辟道路，侦察队员们顾不上休息，仍然顶着风，匍伏在冰面上坚持向北坳的顶部挺进。
    现在，他们来到了一道冰裂缝前。这条冰裂缝狭窄、深陷、坡度在七十度以上，像一个“胡同”，必须从这个“胡同”底部攀援上去，才能到达北坳的顶端。
    运动健将许竞和彭淑力用背紧靠着“冰胡同”的一边，双脚蹬在
  “冰胡同”的另一边，运用最复杂的攀登技术，一寸一寸地向上方移动。这个动作需要全身用力，不到两三分钟，他们全身就被汗水湿透，呼吸变得急促起来。没有坚强的意志，只要稍一放松，就会摔落下来。他们咬着牙，一分一秒地坚持着向上攀登。这个不到三十米高的“冰胡同”，竟使他们花费了整整一个小时的时间才攀登上去。
    当他们到达北坳的顶部时，天已经黑了。这时，他们才想起，他们已经在风雪中搏斗了十多个小时，没有吃饭，没有喝水，忍受着寒冷，忍受着疲劳，但终于胜利地找到了一条绝对安全的路线，打开了攀登珠穆朗玛峰顶的第一关。
                      （未完）
