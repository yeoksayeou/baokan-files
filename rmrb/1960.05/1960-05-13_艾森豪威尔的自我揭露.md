Eisenhower's Self-Exposure

    U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower exposed his hideous features nakedly before the people of the world on May 11. He stated at a press conference that "Since I began my administration, I have issued instructions that we should use all practical means to gather the intelligence necessary to protect the United States and the free world from surprise attack and to enable it to prepare effective defense." This means that U.S. aircraft's intrusion into Soviet airspace to collect military intelligence was carried out under Eisenhower's instructions.

    Eisenhower's statement fully confirms the guilt of the U.S. aircraft intrusion into the Soviet Union. As everyone knows, Eisenhower has been trying his best to portray himself as an "angel of peace" in the past period. While the United States has recently been stepping up its arms expansion, war preparations, and aggression, Eisenhower has continued to make empty talk about peace as if nothing had happened. Even after the criminal activity of the U.S. aircraft intrusion into Soviet airspace was exposed, the Washington authorities still tried to claim that Eisenhower was unaware of such activities. The U.S. State Department even publicly stated that the White House had not "authorized" such flights. But such statements were inherently self-deceiving and could not absolve Eisenhower and his government of guilt. Facing the accusations of world public opinion, Eisenhower had to personally come forward and issue a statement to defend the U.S. aggression. However, the more Eisenhower sophistically defended himself, the more he exposed his true face of imperialism.

    One of the reasons Eisenhower defended his and his government's act of aggression was because "the Soviet Union worships secrecy and concealment." He also said that "this is the main cause of international tension and anxiety today." Look, what kind of "reason" is this! Because you are secretive, I must intrude into your airspace! May I ask, is the United States also secretive? Didn't Eisenhower say that U.S. intelligence gathering activities were "secret" and "must be strictly controlled in every detail"? This also shows that it "worships secrecy and concealment" to such an extent that even after the Soviet Union announced the downing of the U.S. aircraft that intruded into its airspace, it was confident that the secret would not be exposed. The State Department even issued a statement lying that it was a meteorological reconnaissance aircraft sent to collect "ozone" and other such things! In that case, don't other countries also have the right to send aircraft to the United States and all other countries to carry out espionage activities? If all countries did this, wouldn't the world be in chaos and there would be a risk of war at any time? Eisenhower admitted that the Soviet Union did not do this, so what right does the United States have to send aircraft to intrude into the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries?

    As for saying that "secrecy" is "the main cause of international tension and anxiety," that is truly absurd. And it is not only laughable that such absurdities come from the mouth of the U.S. President. Who doesn't know that the main cause of international tension and anxiety is the United States' pursuit of its policy of aggression and war? It is the United States, not another country, that has established more than 250 military bases around socialist countries; it is the United States, not another country, that has stationed more than one million troops in more than 70 countries and regions around the world; it is the United States, not another country, that seriously threatens world peace. All these sources of international tension have nothing to do with "secrecy and concealment." On the contrary, the U.S. aggression and arms expansion activities are so blatant and so naked that they more fully expose the madness of U.S. imperialism and further arouse the opposition of the broad masses of people around the world.

    Another reason Eisenhower defended himself was that the U.S. "deterrent power must not be in danger" and that "the security of the entire free world requires this." This is slightly different from Eisenhower's past statements. People remember that Eisenhower and his government officials always boasted about how powerful the U.S. "deterrent power" was, enough to guarantee the "security of the free world." Why is it that such a powerful "deterrent power" is now suddenly "in danger"? If it is "in danger," then what kind of "deterrent power" is it? Eisenhower obviously would not agree that the "deterrent power" is already "in danger" and has lost its effect, but he insists on creating this reason to defend his act of aggression. If every country uses its own "security" as a reason to invade the airspace of other countries, wouldn't the world be in chaos and there would be a risk of war at any time? In fact, the security of all countries in the world is threatened not by others, but by the United States. The U.S. military bases all over the world, especially those bases for U.S. bombers carrying nuclear weapons, those missile bases, and those bases with U-2 jet aircraft, are all threats to the security of the local countries. Because once the United States starts a war, the first to suffer will be those countries with U.S. bases. That is why the Japanese people have recently been so strongly opposed to the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, and that is why the people of all countries in the world with U.S. military bases hate U.S. imperialism so much. The U.S. policy of aggression and war is the greatest threat to world peace and the greatest threat to the security of all countries.

    The purpose of saying so much is not to argue with Eisenhower. The only purpose is to illustrate one fact: Eisenhower's statement is a statement of an aggressor, and Eisenhower's logic is the logic of a robber!

    It should be pointed out that Eisenhower has always been implementing the imperialist policy of aggression and war, but in the past period, he played some peaceful gestures as a cover. This was not difficult to see. While Eisenhower was making empty talk about peace, he and his government never stopped activities that threatened peace. This inconsistency between words and deeds exposed Eisenhower's two-faced tactics long ago. How can people believe that Eisenhower, as the head of the U.S. government, has nothing to do with the intensified U.S. arms expansion and aggression? Moreover, Eisenhower himself has also clamored for "steadfastly, unobtrusively, and patiently persisting in the effort to maintain our common defense (should be read as arms expansion and war preparations)." Where is he a "peace person"? If Eisenhower's peace tricks have some deceptive effect, it is only temporary and not difficult to see through. Because Eisenhower is implementing a policy of arms expansion and war preparations, he will eventually completely expose his true face of imperialism. Now people see that Eisenhower, who once pretended to be willing to improve East-West relations and ease international tensions, actually instructed U.S. aircraft to intrude into Soviet airspace to provoke on the eve of the summit meeting. The "magic show" that was not so good to begin with has been completely exposed, and the sheepskin has been removed from the wolf.

    The U.S. aircraft's blatant provocation against the Soviet Union and Eisenhower's self-exposure further prove a truth to the people of the world: no illusions should be harboured about Eisenhower and U.S. imperialism. The aggressive nature of U.S. Imperialism represented by Eishenhower has not changed, and will never change. Although today the forces of peace and socialism far outweigh the forces of war and imperialism, and the United States has lost its military advantage, U.S. imperialism will not abandon its aggression plan and will not abandon its war plan against the socialist countries. Eisenhower is not unaware that the Soviet Union possesses the most advanced rocket weapons capable of repelling any aggressor, but he still sends aircraft to intrude into Soviet airspace to provoke, which shows that U.S. imperialism will not willingly abandon its policy of aggression and war because the socialist camp is strong. And Eisenhower's continued insistence on carrying out such provocations even after the failure of his provocative activities against the Soviet Union further proves that: Making trouble, failing, making trouble again, failing again, until extinction, is indeed the law of imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism. Whenever there is an opportunity, U.S. imperialism always wants to carry out aggression and expansion. Of course, this does not mean that the people of all countries should not strive for world peace. Absolutely not. We must persist unremittingly in our efforts to safeguard world peace and make even greater efforts. The problem is that the attainment of world peace depends on the struggle of the masses of people of all countries, on the resolute, thorough and comprehensive exposure of all the aggressive conspiracies of U.S. imperialism, and on the universal awakening and strengthening of unity of the masses of people of all countries. Only by mobilizing the masses of people of all countries to carry out a resolute struggle can we shatter the aggressive plans and war plans of U.S. imperialism and safeguard world peace.

    From the long-term revolutionary struggle, the Chinese people have long clearly recognized that U.S. imperialism is the mortal enemy of the Chinese people and the people of the world. The Chinese people have never harboured any illusions about U.S. imperialism. For more than ten years, U.S. imperialism has consistently pursued a policy of hostility towards the Chinese people, and has vainly attempted to use force, subversion, and economic blockade to strangle our newborn People's Republic. To this day, the United States still occupies our territory of Taiwan and the coastal islands. In his remarks to reporters on May 11, Eisenhower said: "If you rethink the principle of Formosa (note: that is, our Taiwan), you will find that the president has a responsibility to decide whether, in the event that Jinmen and Mazu are attacked, whether this is in fact a prelude to or part of an attack on the Pescadores (note: that is, our Penghu Islands) and Taiwan. If that is the case, then he must participate, because that would be defending Formosa, one of our allies." Eisenhower once again exposed the sinister face of the United States, which refuses to withdraw from our territory of Taiwan and the coastal islands and continues to be hostile to the Chinese people. Not only that, U.S. warships and aircraft, ignoring our warnings, continue to intrude into our territorial waters and airspace. On May 11, U.S. aircraft again intruded into the airspace of our Xisha Islands. This is already the ninety-fifth act of aggression committed by the U.S. robbers in our country since September 1958. This time, U.S. imperialism even openly attempted to deny our country's sovereignty over the Xisha Islands and clamored that the U.S. Seventh Fleet "has the responsibility to protect the security of the South China Sea." The U.S. imperialists should know that every infringement on China's territorial sovereignty will only arouse greater anger and a stronger will to struggle among the Chinese people. The Chinese people must liberate Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu! The Chinese people will never forgive the towering crimes committed by U.S. imperialism against our country. Every blood debt owed to the Chinese people by the U.S. aggressors must be repaid!

### 艾森豪威尔的自我揭露

    艾森豪威尔的自我揭露
    美国总统艾森豪威尔5月11日在全世界人民的面前赤裸裸地暴露出了他的狰狞面目。他在记者招待会上发表声明说：“自从我开始执政以来，我就曾发出指示，用一切实际可行的办法搜集为保护美国及自由世界不受突袭并使之能作有效的防御准备所必需的情报。”这就是说，美国飞机侵犯苏联领空搜集军事情报，就是在艾森豪威尔的指示下进行的。
    艾森豪威尔的这个声明，使美机侵苏事件的罪责得到了完全的证实。大家知道，在过去一个时期中，艾森豪威尔竭力把自己装扮成一个“和平天使”。当美国最近一直在加紧进行扩军备战和侵略活动，艾森豪威尔却若无其事地不断空谈和平。就是在这次美国飞机侵犯苏联领空的罪恶活动被揭露以后，华盛顿当局仍然曾经力图把这种活动说成是艾森豪威尔毫不知情的。美国国务院甚至曾公开声明，白宫并没有“授权”进行这样的飞行。但是这样的说法，本来就是自欺欺人的，它丝毫不能为艾森豪威尔和他的政府开脱罪责。面对着世界舆论的指责，艾森豪威尔才不得不亲自出马发表声明，为美国的侵略罪行辩解。但是，艾森豪威尔愈是强词夺理地进行辩护，愈是暴露了他的帝国主义的真面目。
    艾森豪威尔为他和他的政府这次侵略罪行辩护的理由之一，就是因为“苏联崇拜保密和隐藏”。他并且说“这是今天产生国际紧张局势和不安的主要原因”。大家看，这是什么样的“理由”呵！因为你保密，因此我就要侵入你的领空！请问，美国是不是也保密呢？艾森豪威尔不是说美国搜集情报的活动是“秘密的”，“必须在每个细节上受到严密控制”吗？可见也是“崇拜保密和隐藏”，而且“崇拜”到如此地步，以致在苏联公布击落侵入领空的美机后还自信秘密不会暴露，居然由国务院发表声明，撒谎说那是去搜集“臭氧”之类的气象侦察飞机！既然这样，别的国家不是也有权利派飞机到美国以及所有其他国家去作间谍活动吗？如果所有国家都这样做，那岂不是天下大乱、随时都有发生战争的危险吗？艾森豪威尔承认苏联没有这样做，那么美国又有什么权利派飞机侵入苏联、中国及其他社会主义国家呢？
    至于说到“保密”是“产生国际紧张局势和不安的主要原因”，那真是天下奇谈。而这种奇谈竟然出自美国总统之口，不仅是令人喷饭而已。谁不知道，产生国际紧张局势和不安的主要原因，是美国推行它的侵略政策和战争政策。在社会主义各国周围建立了二百五十多个军事基地的，是美国而不是别国；在全世界七十多个国家和地区驻扎共有一百多万军队的，是美国而不是别国；严重威胁着世界和平的，是美国而不是别国。所有这些造成国际紧张局势的根源，同“保密和隐藏”毫不相干。倒是美国的侵略和扩军备战活动是如此明目张胆，如此赤裸裸，更加充分地暴露了美帝国主义的疯狂性，也更加激起了全世界广大人民群众的反对。
    艾森豪威尔辩护的另一个理由是美国的“威慑力量决不能处于危险中”、“整个自由世界的安全要求这样”。这倒是同艾森豪威尔过去的言论稍有不同。人们记得，艾森豪威尔和他的政府官员们过去总是吹嘘美国的“威慑力量”如何强大，足以保障“自由世界的安全”。为什么那样强大的“威慑力量”现在忽然会“处于危险中”呢？如果是“处于危险中”的话，那还成什么“威慑力量”呢？艾森豪威尔显然是不会同意“威慑力量”已经“处于危险中”，已经失去作用的，但是他偏偏要制造出这个理由来为自己的侵略罪行辩护。如果每个国家都以自己的“安全”为理由去侵犯别国的领空，那岂不是天下大乱、随时都有爆发战争的危险吗？事实上威胁世界各国的安全的，不是别人，正是美国。遍布世界各国的美国军事基地，特别是那些携带核武器的美国轰炸机的基地，那些导弹基地、那些驻有U—2型喷气式飞机的基地，都是对当地国家的安全的威胁。因为美国一旦挑起战争，首先受害的就是设有美国基地的这些国家。这就是为什么最近日本人民这样强烈地反对美日军事同盟条约，这也是为什么全世界所有有美国军事基地的国家的人民那样痛恨美帝国主义。美国的侵略政策和战争政策，是世界和平的最大威胁，是各国安全的最大威胁。
    说了上面这许多话，根本不是要同艾森豪威尔辩论。目的只有一个，这就是要说明一个事实：艾森豪威尔的声明是侵略者的声明，艾森豪威尔的逻辑是强盗的逻辑！
    应当指出，艾森豪威尔一直是在执行帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策的，只不过是在过去一个时期中他玩弄一些和平姿态来作掩护。这本来是不难看出的。在艾森豪威尔空谈和平的同时，他和他的政府一天也没有停止过威胁和平的活动，这种言行不一早就暴露出了艾森豪威尔是在玩弄一套两面手法。人们怎么能够相信，身为美国政府首脑的艾森豪威尔竟然同美国加紧进行的备战和侵略行动没有关系呢？而且就是艾森豪威尔自己，不也是叫嚷“坚定不移地、不事声张地、耐心地坚持为保持我们的共同防务（应读作扩军备战）而努力”吗？他哪里是什么“和平人士”呢？艾森豪威尔的和平把戏如果有一些欺骗作用，也只是暂时的、不难识破的。因为艾森豪威尔既然执行的是扩军备战的政策，他就终究要彻底暴露出他的帝国主义的真面目。现在人们看到了，过去曾经假装愿意改善东西方关系、愿意和缓国际紧张局势的艾森豪威尔，竟然在最高级会议的前夕指示美国的飞机侵入苏联领空进行挑衅。本来就不那么像样的“西洋镜”完全揭穿了，羊皮从狼身上摘下来了。
    美国飞机对苏联的公然挑衅和艾森豪威尔的自我揭露，进一步向全世界人民证明了一个真理：对艾森豪威尔和美帝国主义不能存有任何的幻想。以艾森豪威尔为代表的美帝国主义的侵略本性并没有改变，而且永远不会改变。虽然今天和平和社会主义的力量大大超过了战争和帝国主义的力量，美国已经丧失了它的军事优势，但是美帝国主义并不会因此而放弃它的侵略计划，不会放弃它针对社会主义国家的战争计划。艾森豪威尔不是不知道苏联拥有能够击退任何侵略者的最先进的火箭武器，但是他还是要派遣飞机进入苏联的领空进行挑衅，可见美帝国主义是不会因为社会主义阵营强大就甘心放弃它的侵略政策和战争政策的。而艾森豪威尔在对苏联挑衅的活动失败之后仍然表示要继续进行这样的挑衅，这就更加证明了：捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡，的的确确是帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义的规律。只要有机会，美帝国主义总是要进行侵略扩张的。当然，这并不是说各国人民不要为世界和平而努力。决不是这样。我们必须坚持不懈地为维护世界和平而努力，并且作更大的努力。问题在于世界和平的取得，要靠各国人民群众的斗争，要靠对美帝国主义一切侵略阴谋进行坚决、彻底、全面的揭露，要靠各国人民群众的普遍觉醒和加强团结。只有动员各国人民群众进行坚决的斗争，才能粉碎美帝国主义的侵略计划和战争计划，才能维护世界和平。
  中国人民从长期的革命斗争中，早就清楚地认识到美帝国主义是中国人民和全世界人民的死敌。中国人民对于美帝国主义从来不抱任何幻想。十年多来，美帝国主义一贯执行着敌视中国人民的政策，曾经妄想用武力、颠复活动、经济封锁，来扼杀我们的新生的人民共和国。直到如今，美国还霸占着我国的领土台湾和沿海岛屿，艾森豪威尔在5月11日对记者谈话中说：“如果你们重新想一下关于福摩萨（按：即我国的台湾）的原则的话，你们将会发现，总统有责任来决定是否，万一金门和马祖受到攻击，是否这在事实上是对佩斯卡多尔群岛（按：即我国的澎湖列岛）和台湾的攻击的前奏还是攻击的一部分。如果情况是这样，那么他必须参加，因为那时这将是保卫福摩萨，我们的盟国之一。”艾森豪威尔再一次暴露了美国绝不肯从我国的领土台湾和沿海岛屿撤退，继续与中国人民为敌的凶恶面目。不仅如此，美国的军舰和飞机，不顾我国的警告，仍不断侵犯我国的领海领空。5月11日，美机又侵入我西沙群岛领空。这已经是美国强盗从1958年9月以来的第九十五次在我国犯下的侵略罪行。这一次，美帝国主义甚至公然企图否认我国对西沙群岛的主权，并且扬言美国的第七舰队“负有保卫南中国海安全的责任”。美帝国主义者须知：你们对于中国领土主权的每一次侵犯，都只会激起中国人民更大的愤怒和更加坚强的斗争意志。中国人民一定要解放台湾、澎湖、金门和马祖！中国人民决不饶恕美帝国主义对我国所犯下的滔天罪行。美国侵略者欠下中国人民的每一笔血债，都必定要偿还的！
