A Letter Sent to Japan

    "He Can Think"
    Tian Han
      Mr. Akita Ujaku's Words
    In the ranks of the anti-American patriotic struggle in Japan, many artists' names have been discovered. The soul engineers of Japan have successively marched to the fighting "crossroads." For example, the female poet Sumako Fukao delivered a moving speech rebuking Nobusuke Kishi, and the famous actress Yaeko Yamamoto read aloud to the congress the declaration of all male and female actors in the Japanese theater world against the "Security Treaty." Recently, the commemorative issue of the 200th issue of the Japanese "Drama" magazine contained an article by the old playwright Akita Ujaku, "Cannibals and the Security Treaty," which also passionately stated:
    "...Present-day Japan, under the control of American forces, is creating a 'slave system.' We are placed in the same situation as 'cannibals.' The Japan-U.S. Security Treaty legalizes slave morality. Even if this treaty is not revised, it implements this policy, which is to allow the weak to fight each other, while they themselves profit from it, ensuring the rationalization of the American economy and adjusting their labor relations, labor disputes, etc., through national struggles of other countries. And we are dominated by this thing that makes slave morality cultural...
    "Looking at such reality, we know that we must conduct a fundamental struggle against the revision of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty. Unfortunately, due to my poor health, I cannot participate in demonstrations, but I am very happy to see many friends participating in this struggle through newspapers and television. People like Kenzo Nakajima, Kiyoshi Aono, Tatsuzo Ishikawa, and Zenei Hotta are all participating. These friends are demonstrating in the streets and protesting at the Prime Minister's official residence. Among them, we can clearly see Mr. Seikichi Uno. It is truly inspiring that all working people and cultural figures oppose this Security Treaty, especially Mr. Seikichi Uno, who has worked with us since we were young, also reading out the resolution against the ratification of the Security Treaty. I believe this struggle will surely be victorious!"
    Mr. Akita Ujaku is the president of the Japan Stage Art Academy. He is already an octogenarian. Hearing his speech makes people feel that Japan is truly moving. Any tyrannical struggles of Nobusuke Kishi can only accelerate his entry into the grave. We cannot help but repeat Chairman Mao's words:
    "The Japanese people are very promising."
          "He Can Think"
    The articles by Saburo Endo, a former Japanese soldier, and Kazumi Yamamoto, a member of the Tokyo "Self-Defense Forces," reprinted by the People's Daily on May 17, aroused great interest in us. With Nobusuke Kishi's perverse actions, the Japanese people's awareness is increasing day by day. What is particularly gratifying is that young active-duty soldier vowed "not to take up arms to participate in a wrong war." This reminds me of the famous line by the German poet and director Bertolt Brecht:
    "Generals, man is very useful,
    He can fly and he can kill.
    But he has one shortcoming:
    He can think."
    In Japan, there are more and more people who "can think." The deeper the struggle, the more people become aware. The traitors' conspiracy to launch a new war will not succeed. Nobusuke Kishi recently said: "As time passes, people will forget everything!" And we must constantly remind everyone not to forget the heinous crimes committed by this traitor, and resolutely let him perish in the ocean of mass anger!

    “他会思想”
    田汉
      秋田雨雀先生的话
    在日本反美爱国的斗争行列中，发现许多文艺家的名字，日本的灵魂工程师们先后走向了战斗的“十字街头”了。如女诗人深尾须磨子发表了动人的斥责岸信介的演说，名女演员山本安英向大会朗读了日本话剧界全体男女演员反对“安全条约”的宣言。最近日本“戏剧”杂志创刊二百号纪念号载有老剧作家秋田雨雀先生的“食人种与安全条约”一文，也痛切激昂地说：
    “……现在的日本在美国势力支配下正制造
  ‘奴隶制度’。我们被摆在跟‘食人种’同样的情况下，日美安全条约就是把奴隶道德法律化。这个条约就是不修改也贯彻着这种政策，即让弱者互相搏斗，而他们自己于中取利，使美国经济合理化得到保障，使他们的劳资关系、劳动争议等等由别国的民族斗争得到调整。而我们就被这种把奴隶道德成文化的东西所支配……
    “看了这样的现实，可知我们必须对日美安全条约的改订进行根本性的斗争。可惜我因身体弱，不能参加示威游行，但我从报纸、电视，看到许多朋友都参加了这个斗争，真叫人高兴。像中岛健藏，青野季吉，石川达三，崛田善卫诸君都参加了。这些朋友们到街头示威也到首相官邸抗议，其中还清楚地看到宇野重吉君。像这样一切劳动人民，文化人都反对这个安全条约，特别像宇野重吉君那样同我们从青年时候一道工作过来的人也朗读着反对批准安全条约的决议文，真叫人气壮。我相信这个斗争一定会取得胜利！”
    秋田雨雀先生是日本舞台艺术学院的院长，他已经是八十高龄的老人了，听到他的发言使人感到日本真动起来了。岸信介的任何横暴挣扎只能加速他进入坟墓的过程。我们不由得重复毛主席的话：
    “日本人民是很有希望的。”
          “他会思想”
    5月17日人民日报转载的日本旧军人远藤三郎和东京“自卫队”队员山本一三的文章，引起我们很大兴趣，随着岸信介的倒行逆施，日本人民的觉悟一天天提高了。特别使人高兴的是那位年青的现役军人发誓“不拿起枪杆子参加错误的战争”。这使我想起德国诗人兼导演家贝妥尔特·布莱希特的名句：
    “将军，人是很有用的，
    他会飞，也会杀人。
    但是他有一个缺憾：
    他会思想。”
    在日本，“会思想”的人越来越多了。斗争越深入，觉悟了的人就越多。卖国贼们发动新战争的阴谋就无法得逞。岸信介最近说：“时间一过，人们将把一切都忘掉！”而我们就是要时时刻刻提醒大家别忘了这个卖国贼所犯的滔天罪恶，断然叫他在群众愤怒的海洋里完蛋！
