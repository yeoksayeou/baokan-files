Xinhua News Agency, May 19th: Indonesian Foreign Ministry and Intelligence Ministry officials are publicly distorting facts and fabricating excuses, preparing to declare officials of our embassy and consulates in Indonesia "persona non grata."

On April 27, 1960, the "Da Baokang" vessel, sent by our government to pick up overseas Chinese, was forcibly hijacked by the relevant Indonesian authorities in Selat Panjang, Riau Province, Indonesia. On the same day, in Samarinda, East Kalimantan Province, Indonesia, the local military authorities forcibly placed Jiang Yan, our Consul in Banjarmasin, under house arrest.

Our embassy in Indonesia has lodged serious protests with the Indonesian Foreign Ministry on May 9th and 13th respectively regarding these two incidents.

On May 3rd, Indonesian Attorney General Gunawan made malicious rumors in a statement to reporters, saying that the ships sent by the People's Republic of China to transport overseas Chinese back to China had fled Indonesian territorial waters without permission.

At the same time, certain Indonesian newspapers published a large number of reports and commentaries on the "Da Baokang" vessel incident that distorted the facts, attacking and slandering our embassies and consulates and our country. In view of the above-mentioned rumors and slanders by Indonesian government officials and certain newspapers, and the Indonesian Foreign Ministry's verbal rejection of China's protest note regarding the forced house arrest of Consul Jiang Yan, the spokesman of our embassy in Indonesia held a press conference on May 13th and issued a statement explaining the truth of the two incidents in order to clarify the facts.

In the above-mentioned two protest notes, our embassy in Indonesia, in addition to explaining the true situation of the incidents and their serious nature, also requested the Indonesian government to handle these two incidents promptly and respond as soon as possible.

However, the Indonesian government not only failed to handle these two incidents or make a reply, but Indonesian Foreign Ministry Secretary-General Suwito, Director of the Asian and Pacific Department Suska, and Intelligence Ministry Spokesman further issued statements on these two incidents that distorted the facts and reversed right and wrong, and they greatly slandered officials of our embassy and consulates in Indonesia, even claiming that they would declare certain diplomatic officials of our country in Indonesia "persona non grata."

The two protest notes submitted by the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia to the Indonesian Foreign Ministry regarding the Indonesian authorities' forced hijacking of the "Da Baokang" vessel and the forced house arrest of Consul Jiang Yan were published on May 19th.

Xinhua News Agency, May 19th, Jakarta dispatch: The Indonesian cabinet held a plenary meeting on the evening of the 17th.

Intelligence Minister Maladi said after the meeting that the meeting discussed the domestic and international political situation. He also said that Sukarno, who is abroad, has been constantly informed of all developments in the country.

On the same morning, the "Indonesian Torch" newspaper published a message under the title "May Be Declared Persona Non Grata" saying that the cabinet plenary meeting may consider restricting the activities of Chinese diplomatic personnel in Indonesia or expelling some of them. According to senior Indonesian government officials, after contacting President Sukarno and Foreign Minister Subandrio, who are currently visiting abroad, "far-reaching measures" such as declaring Chinese diplomatic personnel "persona non grata" will be taken.

The newspaper also reported that "comprehensive" reports on the recent incident in which the authorities of Riau Province, Indonesia, forcibly hijacked the Chinese government's "Da Baokang" vessel sent to pick up overseas Chinese and the incident in which the authorities of Samarinda forcibly placed the Chinese consul under house arrest have been delivered to Sukarno and Subandrio, who are currently visiting abroad.

Xinhua News Agency, May 19th, Jakarta dispatch: After the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia's statement on May 13th exposed the truth about the Samarinda military authorities' forced house arrest of Chinese Consul Jiang Yan and obstruction of overseas Chinese returning to their country, three Indonesian newspapers became enraged and brazenly attacked the People's Republic of China and the Chinese Ambassador to Indonesia on the 16th.

The "Indonesia Archipelago Daily" clamored that in order to offset the "excessive actions" of the Chinese Embassy, the Indonesian government "must stop (the Chinese Embassy) from issuing statements and sending letters."

This newspaper, which has been revealed by Jakarta newspapers to have some relationship with the United States Information Service and has consistently been notorious for its anti-China and anti-communist stance, brazenly attacked and insulted the Chinese Ambassador to Indonesia, clamoring to "send Ambassador Huang Zhen and his staff back." It also slandered the Chinese Embassy's statement explaining the truth of the incident as an "anti-Indonesian movement" and "insulting the Indonesian government in a rude manner in public."

Prior to this, this newspaper published an article on the 13th attacking the Bank of China, slandering it for carrying out "political activities."

The right-wing English newspaper "Indonesia Times" editorial clamored: "Now is the time to strike them" and to "teach" the Chinese Embassy a lesson. This newspaper used extremely vicious words such as "the root of all evil" to attack Chinese Ambassador to Indonesia Huang Zhen, clamoring to declare Ambassador Huang Zhen "persona non grata." It also slandered the Bank of China, reviling it as a "den of spies and subversives," clamoring to close the Bank of China.

The "National Economic Daily" also slandered the Chinese Embassy's statement and attempted to use the overseas Chinese issue to provoke relations between China and other Southeast Asian countries.

    印度尼西亚某些官员公然歪曲事实制造借口
    声言将宣布我使馆人员为“不受欢迎的人”
    报纸透露：内阁开会可能讨论限制我外交官员活动或驱逐某些人员
    新华社19日讯　印度尼西亚外交部和情报部官员公然歪曲事实，制造借口，准备宣布我国驻印度尼西亚大使馆和领事馆官员为“不受欢迎的人”。
  1960年4月27日，在印度尼西亚廖内省的石叻班让发生了印度尼西亚有关当局武力劫持我国政府派去接侨的“大宝康”轮事件。同日，在印度尼西亚东加里曼丹省的三马林达发生了当地军事当局武力软禁我国驻马辰领事江燕的事件。
    对这两次事件，我国驻印度尼西亚大使馆已分别于5月9日和13日向印度尼西亚外交部提出了严重抗议照会。
    5月3日印度尼西亚最高检察长古那宛在向记者发表的谈话中恶意造谣说，中华人民共和国派去接运华侨回国的船只未经许可擅自逃出了印度尼西亚的领海。
    与此同时，印度尼西亚某些报纸就“大宝康”轮事件发表了大量歪曲事实的报道和评论，大肆攻击和诬蔑我国使领馆和我国。鉴于印度尼西亚政府官员和某些报纸的上述造谣诬蔑，和印度尼西亚外交部口头拒绝了中国方面关于武力软禁江燕领事的抗议照会，我国驻印度尼西亚大使馆发言人已在5月13日举行记者招待会，发表声明说明两次事件的真象，以澄清是非。
    我国驻印度尼西亚大使馆在上述两项抗议照会中，除说明了事件的真实情况和事件的严重性质外，并且要求印度尼西亚政府对这两次事件迅速予以处理，及早作出答复。
    但是印度尼西亚政府对这两次事件不但未进行处理和作出答复，印度尼西亚外交部秘书长苏维托、亚洲和太平洋司司长苏斯卡和情报部发言人反而进一步就这两次事件发表歪曲事实、颠倒是非的谈话，并且对我国驻印度尼西亚大使馆和领事馆的官员大肆诬蔑，甚至声言要宣布我国驻印度尼西亚的某些外交官员为“不受欢迎的人”。
    中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆就印度尼西亚有关当局武力劫持“大宝康”轮事件和武力软禁江燕领事事件向印度尼西亚外交部提出的两项抗议照会已于5月19日公布。
    新华社19日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚内阁在17日晚上举行了全体会议。
    情报部长马拉迪在会后说，这次会议讨论了国内外的政治形势。他还说，已经向在国外的苏加诺不断地报告国内的一切事态发展。
    当天上午，“印度尼西亚火炬报”在“可能被宣布为不受欢迎的人”标题下发表消息说，这次内阁全体会议可能考虑限制中国外交人员在印度尼西亚的行动或者把其中某些人驱逐出去。据印度尼西亚政府高级官员说，在雅加达与目前正在国外访问的苏加诺总统和苏班德里约外交部长进行接触后，会采取宣布中国外交人员为“不受欢迎的人”这种“影响深远的措施”。
    这家报纸还报道，关于最近印度尼西亚廖内省当局武力劫持中国政府派往接运华侨的“大宝康号”轮船事件和三马林达当局强行软禁中国领事事件的“全面”报告，已经送达目前正在国外访问的苏加诺和苏班德里约。
    新华社19日讯　雅加达消息：中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆5月13日的声明揭露了三马林达军事当局强行软禁中国领事江燕和阻挠华侨归国事件真相以后，16日印度尼西亚三家报纸恼羞成怒，狂妄地攻击中华人民共和国和中国驻印度尼西亚大使。
    “印度尼西亚群岛报”大叫大嚷说，为了抵销中国大使馆“过分的行动”，印度尼西亚政府“必须制止（中国大使馆）发表声明和寄信件”。
    这家曾经被雅加达报纸揭露与美国新闻处有某种关系并且一贯以反华反共而臭名昭著的报纸，狂妄地攻击和侮辱中国驻印度尼西亚的大使，叫嚷要“把黄镇大使和他的工作人员送回去。”它还诬蔑中国大使馆发表说明事件真相的声明是“反印度尼西亚运动”、“在公众面前以不礼貌的手段侮辱了印度尼西亚政府”。
    在这以前，这家报纸在13日发表了攻击中国银行的文章，诬蔑它进行“政治活动”。
    右翼英文报纸“印度尼西亚时报”的社论叫嚷说：“现在要给他们以打击”，要“教训”中国大使馆。这家报纸使用“万恶之源”这样的极其恶毒的字眼来攻击中国驻印度尼西亚大使黄镇，叫嚷宣布黄镇大使为“不受欢迎的人”。它还污蔑中国银行，辱骂它为“间谍和颠覆分子的窝”，叫嚷封闭中国银行。
    “全国经济日报”也污蔑中国大使馆的声明，并且企图借华侨问题挑拨中国同其它东南亚国家的关系。
