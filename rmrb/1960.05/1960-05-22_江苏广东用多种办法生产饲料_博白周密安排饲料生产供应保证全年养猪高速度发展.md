Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing: Jiangsu Province is fully mobilizing the masses and adopting various methods to collect and comprehensively utilize various feeds in large quantities to welcome the birth of a large number of piglets.

People's communes in various places, taking advantage of the current favorable opportunity of wild grass and wild vegetables growing luxuriantly, launched a mass campaign to collect wild feed. Members of the Tongpao Commune in Huaiyin City collected 250,000 jin of wild grass in a single day, which can feed 6,000 pigs for five days.

Each commune in Wuxi County has designated more than 40,000 mu of green manure for management by commune and team pig farms, and has collected and stored 4.69 million jin of fresh green manure in just over a month.

Various places have also established feed processing factories on a large scale and engaged in comprehensive utilization to prepare concentrated feed for pigs. Each commune in Binhai County has established 31 feed processing factories, and in just 20 days, they have crushed 1.55 million jin of sweet potato vines and rice straw bran for commune and team pig farms. Thirty-two communes in the suburbs of Wuxi City have established grain-free distilleries, using bran, rice roots, and more than 20 kinds of wild plants to make sugar and brew wine, producing 9.88 million jin of distiller's grains and sugar residue in one month.

Urban communes make full use of various scraps as the main source of feed. The Qinhuai District of Nanjing organized citizens to collect 6.55 million jin of rice washing water, vegetable roots, and vegetable peels in the first quarter of this year, which can feed 6,500 pigs for three months.

Various places are also seizing the opportunity to plant early-maturing and high-yielding feed crops on the already determined feed bases. The province has utilized water surfaces, "ten edges" gaps, and newly reclaimed wasteland to sow more than 1.4 million mu of early-maturing and high-yielding feed crops such as spring corn, carrots, alfalfa, sweet potatoes, and sugar beets.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou: Guangdong Province is taking advantage of the favorable conditions that miscellaneous grains can be planted all year round, tapping the potential of the land to a great extent, and widely planting miscellaneous grain crops to prepare concentrated feed for the great development of the pig raising industry this year.

In order to adapt to the situation of the great development of pig raising this year, the Provincial Party Committee emphasized the importance of grasping the production of miscellaneous grains as early as last winter, and proposed treating winter-planted miscellaneous grain crops as a production season. The planting area of ​​sweet potatoes, wheat, peas, broad beans, potatoes, and other miscellaneous grains harvested in spring this year reached more than 10 million mu in the province, more than double that of last year, becoming the year with the most winter-planted and spring-harvested miscellaneous grain crops in history. At present, these crops have been basically harvested, and some of them have been used to feed a large number of newborn piglets.

Starting from the "Beginning of Spring" this year, the Provincial Party Committee put forward the idea of ​​grasping early rice on the one hand and spring-sown miscellaneous grains on the other. Before the early rice preparation came to an end and the busy season of transplanting rice seedlings arrived, the province mobilized two to three million laborers to rush to reclaim wasteland and rush to plant spring-sown miscellaneous grains and feed crops such as sweet potatoes, corn, sorghum, yellow millet, and beans. After the early rice transplanting was basically completed, various places rushed for the season again and carried out the "second spring plowing", continuing to reclaim wasteland, interplant, and intercrop to expand the spring-sown miscellaneous grain area. Now, the total area of ​​spring-sown miscellaneous grains in the province has reached 12 million mu, an increase of more than 70% compared with last year.

This newspaper reports that pig raising in Bobai County, Guangxi, continues to develop at a high speed during the season when feed is "scarce." In the first three months and ten days of this year, the total number of pigs in stock in Bobai County reached more than 450,000, a sharp increase of 39.8% compared with the end of last year. More than 129,000 pigs were added in more than three months.

In previous years, after entering the spring, this county often saw a sharp decline in the number of pigs raised due to the "scarcity" of feed.

Since last year, in implementing the policy of "taking grain as the key link and pigs as the first priority," the Bobai County Party Committee has summed up the experiences and lessons of the decline in pigs in the spring in the past. In addition to taking measures such as retaining large breeding pigs, achieving full pregnancy and high production of sows, ensuring the full survival of piglets, and grasping management, disease prevention, and hygiene, it has prominently grasped the planned production and planned supply of feed. The main method of planned production is to establish feed bases and implement cyclical production. The county has organized 800 feed production teams (a total of more than 3,800 people), allocating more than 30,000 mu of land (accounting for 3.5% of the county's cultivated land area). The so-called cyclical production is to divide the whole year into three production cycles according to the growing period of general feed crops from planting to harvesting, which is about four months, and make thorough arrangements for what to plant and what to harvest in each cycle, so as to achieve planting in every season, harvesting in every month, and supply every day. At the same time, the methods of intercropping, intercropping, and rotation are adopted on the feed base to make full use of the land. For example, in the first cycle, pumpkins are planted, combined with intercropping corn; in the second cycle, pumpkins and corn are harvested, and soybeans are planted immediately. After the soybeans are harvested in August, sweet potatoes are immediately planted, and vegetables are intercropped in the sweet potato fields. Such continuous rotation and continuous replacement of crop varieties ensure that the crops continue to grow and that there is always harvesting and planting.

The methods of rational use and planned supply of feed are: first, according to the size and type of pigs, supply different quantities and qualities of feed separately. For example, more miscellaneous grains are used for breeding pigs, dairy pigs, and piglets; breeding pigs are mainly fed with green feed, and dairy pigs are supplied with more fine feed. Second, rationally adjust according to the harvest season of feed crops to achieve the purpose of supplementing deficiencies with abundance. In summer, when there is more green feed, in addition to saving concentrated feed as much as possible, it is also necessary to do a good job in the storage and reserve of green feed; in late winter and early spring, when green feed is scarce, more dry feed and concentrated feed are used to ensure that the pigs are fat and strong.

    江苏广东用多种办法生产饲料
    博白周密安排饲料生产供应保证全年养猪高速度发展
    据新华社南京电　江苏省各地充分发动群众，采取各种办法，大量收集和综合利用各种饲料，迎接大批仔猪的出生。
    各地人民公社根据当前野草野菜丛生的有利时机，开展了群众性采集野生饲料运动。淮阴市同袍公社社员，突击一天采集了野草二十五万斤，可供六千头猪吃五天。
    无锡县各公社共划出四万多亩绿肥，给社队猪场管理，一个多月即收贮绿肥鲜草四百六十九万斤。
    各地还大办饲料加工厂，大搞综合利用，为猪准备精饲料。滨海县各公社办了三十一个饲料加工厂，仅二十天时间就为社、队猪场碾碎山芋藤、稻草糠一百五十五万斤。无锡市郊有三十二个公社办起无粮糠酒厂，利用统糠、稻根以及二十多种野生植物做糖酿酒，一个月生产酒糟糖渣九百八十八万斤。
    城镇公社充分利用各种下脚作为饲料的主要来源。南京秦淮区组织市民今年一季度收集到淘米水、菜根、菜皮等六百五十五万斤，可供六千五百头猪吃三个月。
    各地还抓紧时机，在已确定的饲料基地上种植早熟、高产饲料作物。全省已经利用水面、“十边”隙地和新垦荒地，播种春玉米、胡萝卜、苜蓿、山芋、糖萝卜等早熟、高产饲料作物一百四十多万亩。
    据新华社广州电　广东各地利用一年四季都可以种植杂粮的有利条件，大挖土地潜力，广种杂粮作物，为今年养猪业的大发展准备好精饲料。
    为了适应今年养猪大发展的形势，早在去年冬季，省委就强调抓好杂粮生产，提出把冬种杂粮作物当作一造生产来抓。全省今年春收的甘薯、小麦、豌豆、蚕豆、马铃薯等杂粮种植面积达到一千多万亩，比去年扩大两倍以上，成为历史上冬种春收杂粮作物最多的一年。目前这些作物已基本收获完毕，有一部分已用于喂养大批新生的小猪。
    今年“立春”开始，省委又提出一手抓早稻，一手抓春种杂粮。全省在早稻备耕告一段落，插秧大忙来到以前，调集了二、三百万劳动力，突击开垦荒地，抢种甘薯、玉米、高粱、黄粟、豆类等春种杂粮和饲料作物。早稻插秧基本结束后，各地再赶季节，进行了“第二次春耕”，继续开荒、间种、套种，扩大春种杂粮面积。现在，全省春种杂粮面积共达一千二百万亩，比去年增加了七成多。
    本报讯　广西博白县在饲料“青黄不接”的季节，养猪继续高速度发展。博白县在今年头三个月零十天中，全县存栏的生猪达四十五万多头，比去年年底激增39.8％。三个多月共增加生猪十二万九千多头。
    这个县历年入春以后，因为饲料“青黄不接”，常常是养猪数下降很多。
    去年以来，中共博白县委在贯彻执行“以粮为纲，以猪为首”的方针中，总结了过去春季生猪下降的经验教训，除采取大留种猪、大搞母猪满怀高产、小猪全活、抓好经营管理、防疫卫生等工作外，突出地抓住了饲料的计划生产和计划供应。计划生产的主要办法是：建立饲料基地，实行周期生产。全县组织了饲料生产队八百个（共三千八百多人），划出土地三万多亩（占全县耕地面积3.5％）。所谓周期生产，就是根据一般饲料作物从种到收大约四个月的生长期，将全年分为三个生产周期，对每个周期种些什么，收些什么，都作了周密的安排，做到季季有种，月月有收，天天有供应。同时，在饲料基地上采取了间种、套种，以及轮种相结合的办法，充分利用土地。如第一周期种南瓜，结合间种玉米；第二周期收南瓜、玉米，马上种上黄豆，8月收了黄豆又立即种上红薯，在红薯地里再间种蔬菜。如此不断轮作，不断替换作物品种，以保证作物生长不断，经常有收有种。
    合理使用、计划供应饲料的办法是：第一，根据猪的大小和种类，分别供应不同数量、质量的饲料。如对种猪、奶猪、小猪多用杂粮；架子猪则以青料为主，奶猪则多供应一些细料。第二，根据饲料作物的收获季节进行合理调剂，达到以丰补歉的目的。在夏季青料较多时，除了尽量节约精料外，还要做好青料的贮藏和储备；冬末春初，青料较少，则多用干料、精料，保证生猪肥壮。（附图片）
