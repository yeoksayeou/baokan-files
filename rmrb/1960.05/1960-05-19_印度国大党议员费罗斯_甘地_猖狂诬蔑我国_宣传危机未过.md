Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 17th: According to the Indian Press Trust report from Calcutta, Indian National Congress MP and Prime Minister Nehru's son-in-law, Feroze Gandhi, fabricated a story in Calcutta on May 15th, saying that India's long-standing culture and tradition "has been severely impacted by China's brutal perfidy". Speaking at a public gathering in Calcutta, Feroze Gandhi also attacked China, saying, "India hoped in the past and still hopes to get along in a spirit of good neighborliness, but Communist China does not seem to think so, as can be clearly seen from its intentions and seizure of a portion of Indian territory."

Feroze Gandhi also propagated to the Indian public: "The crisis has not passed". He even said, "If a temporary solution is reached, this problem will become even bigger in the near future and may take many years to resolve." He said, "In order to solve such problems, we (India) need strength."

    印度国大党议员费罗斯·甘地
    猖狂诬蔑我国　宣传危机未过
    新华社新德里17日电　据印度报业托辣斯从加尔各答报道，印度国大党议员、尼赫鲁总理的女婿费罗斯·甘地5月15日在加尔各答无中生有地说，印度悠久的文化和传统“由于中国的粗暴的背信弃义的行为而受到严重的冲打”。费罗斯·甘地在加尔各答的一次公众集会上讲话时还攻击中国说，“印度过去希望，而且仍然希望本着睦邻的精神相处，但是共产党中国似乎不这样想，从它的意图和强占一部分印度领土可以明显地看出这一点。”
    费罗斯·甘地还向印度公众宣传说：“危机并没有过去”。他甚至于说，“如果达成临时性的解决，这个问题在不远的将来将变得更大，可能需要好几年才能解决。”他说，“为了解决这样的问题，我们（印度）需要力量”。
