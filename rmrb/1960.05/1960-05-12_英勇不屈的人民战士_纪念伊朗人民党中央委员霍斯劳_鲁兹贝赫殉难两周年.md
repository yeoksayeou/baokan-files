    The Indomitable People's Warrior
    —Commemorating the Second Anniversary of the Martyrdom of Khosrow Ruzbeh, Member of the Central Committee of the People's Party of Iran
    Iran Xi Ma
    It has been two years since the martyrdom of Comrade Khosrow Ruzbeh, the loyal son of the Iranian people and member of the Central Committee of the People's Party of Iran. Two years ago, the Iranian reactionaries used American bullets to slaughter this people's hero of Iran, but the Iranian people were not intimidated by American bullets. They are waging a tenacious struggle for the genuine independence of their motherland.
    Everyone remembers the unfortunate events that took place in Iran in 1953: American and British imperialists colluded to orchestrate a reactionary military coup in Iran, and the then National Front government headed by Mohammad Mosaddegh was overthrown. The most reactionary feudal forces in Iran, represented by King Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had been driven away by the people, returned to Iran; the oil companies that had been nationalized by Iran fell back into the hands of imperialist monopoly capital. American imperialist colonial forces massively invaded Iran, re-establishing the reactionary forces headed by the King, and plunged the Iranian people into a new and even heavier abyss of suffering.
    Since then, the American-Iranian reactionaries have launched a bloody white terror against the people. Under the direct orders of the Americans, Iranian prisons and exile sites were quickly filled with patriots who refused to submit to imperialist enslavement. Every day, Iranian patriots were tied to the gallows, and the executioner Pahlavi, according to the instructions of his American masters, signed his detestable name on the death sentences of Iranian patriotic fighters.
    American spies who came to Iran under the guise of "experts" and "advisors" were the direct instigators of the torture of Iranian freedom fighters. In order to purge "suspects" from the army, six hundred outstanding Iranian officers were arrested and imprisoned simply because they had revolutionary ideas, and some of them were killed.
    In the four years after the reactionary coup, the progressive forces in Iran suffered great damage, but the white terror could never eliminate the progressive forces in Iran. The remaining forces of the People's Party of Iran, under the leadership of Khosrow Ruzbeh, continued to struggle against imperialism and the dark reactionary forces.
    Khosrow Ruzbeh was one of the famous and talented young officers of the Iranian army. His struggle against the decadent lives of the King, the royal family, and the army commanders had already aroused the hostility and hatred of the reactionaries fifteen years ago.
    His first book was called "Blind Obedience." This book criticized the brutal system in the Iranian army and had an important influence on young officers, senior officers, and soldiers.
    In 1945, he was forced to go underground due to persecution. During thirteen years of underground struggle, he was arrested three times by the Iranian puppet government, but each time he escaped the clutches of the enemy with the help of friends.
    Between 1955 and 1957, the reactionary Iranian government, under the direct planning of the Americans, undermined the Iranian national movement and its vanguard—the People's Party of Iran. At this time, collective massacres, terror, and imprisonment put the people in a difficult situation. Comrade Khosrow Ruzbeh risked his life to gather the dispersed forces of the Party and organized and consolidated the Party's underground organization. The Party continued to lead the people in their struggle, posing a great threat to imperialism and the Iranian reactionaries.
    The name of Khosrow Ruzbeh made the American-Iranian reactionaries afraid. Therefore, the enemy mobilized all its forces to arrest him, and finally, in 1957, due to the betrayal of several traitors, Khosrow Ruzbeh was arrested. This was a "victory" for the reactionary Iranian government. The Americans gave King another reward for his "meritorious service" in opposing communism.
    Since Khosrow Ruzbeh was arrested, the enemy had hoped to completely eliminate the People's Party in its own way (the way of beasts). The reactionaries savagely retaliated against Ruzbeh because he had played a huge role in the work of establishing and developing freedom-loving Iranian officers. They used torture to force him to beg the King for mercy and attempted to use these tricks for propaganda to consolidate the King's unstable throne.
    However, the cruel punishments of American imperialism and the Iranian reactionaries could not destroy Ruzbeh's iron will. Even after his arrest, he still sent out a call to the people from prisons and torture chambers to defend the Party and defend his own just beliefs. This unwavering revolutionary spirit broke through the iron gates of the prison, ignited the hearts of the people, and gave them great strength.
    The enemy demanded countless times through torture that Ruzbeh ask the King for forgiveness, but he said: "This King asks the people to forgive his countless crimes; but the people will never forgive him!"
    When torture was no longer useful, the enemy came up with another vicious plan. The King's agents told him that if he agreed to write a letter to the King and ask for forgiveness for the past, he could live. However, Ruzbeh replied: "I will do nothing but serve the people and the motherland. I will not ask for forgiveness from the King or any other leaders of the government. I believe that any such request is detrimental to the dignity of a Communist." Finally, the enemy despaired of forcing him to submit. The King ordered that his trial be prepared as soon as possible.
    A completely arranged so-called court was organized inside the prison. The executioners, who had been instructed in advance to prepare the verdict, put on the costumes of military court judges and sat on the judges' seats. They spent only one day "hearing" this special case, which the military prosecutor believed was composed of six thousand charges, and handed down a death sentence.
    Khosrow Ruzbeh gave an eight-hour indictment in court, which was a righteous accusation against imperialism and the corrupt reactionary forces. His words hit the enemy's vital points like bullets. He tenaciously defended his political beliefs in court, saying: "I am proud to be a member of the People's Party of Iran and infinitely cherish my signature on the Party's membership list; I believe that the People's Party of Iran is the only party seeking the liberation of the Iranian people. Even if you burn me in the fire a hundred times, I will still be a member of the People's Party, because all the cells of my body belong to the Party."
    Khosrow Ruzbeh unequivocally admitted that he was a Communist and believed that Communism was the only path to human freedom. He said: "I have no doubt that socialism will triumph throughout the world, even if my bones have turned to ashes by then."
    He criticized the anti-national government's foreign policy after the coup, believing that dragging Iran into the Baghdad Pact was the result of adhering to the imperialist war policy.
    When the prosecutor accused him of violating the constitutional monarchy, he replied: "What kind of constitutional monarchy is it? This accusation is like you accusing me of stealing your money when you have not a penny in your pocket. There is no constitutional monarchy in Iran for me to violate. In Iran, the constitution has been completely distorted and trampled upon by the dictatorial interests of the King and the ruling group."
    In response to the military prosecutor's indictment requesting that he be sentenced to death as the founder of the Varmia Party organization, Ruzbeh said: "Although I believe that the death sentences against me and my comrades are unjust and believe that all these sentences are unjust and illegal, I am proud that I will be executed as the founder of the freedom-loving Iranian officers organization."
    The Iranian Supreme Court also approved the death sentence. On May 11, 1958, this brave, fearless, and fighting son of the Iranian people was murdered by the executioners.
    It has been seven years since American and British imperialism, with the help of the reactionary ruling group in Iran, turned Iran into its own playground. The "Central Treaty Organization" aggressive bloc and the US-Iran bilateral military agreements have turned Iran into a military base against friendly neighbors—the Soviet Union, Iraq, and Afghanistan. Iran has been following the imperialist aggression policy, increasingly moving towards severing relations with the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism, and deepening its dependence on the most ferocious enemies of peace and all mankind day by day through military treaties.
    Due to the implementation of the imperialist war policy, a serious crisis has occurred in our country's economy, and 50 to 60% of the national budget is used for military expenditures. Poverty and unemployment shroud the lives of the Iranian people. The reactionaries use bullets to deal with the slightest protest and opposition. Workers' strike movements are bloodily suppressed. Even young students who protest against the colonial education system are shot at.
    In recent years, when the international balance of power has undergone a drastic change in favor of the camp of peace and socialism, and the national democratic revolutionary movements in Asian, African, and Latin American countries have continuously achieved victories, especially after the outbreak of the Iraqi revolution, the imperialist rule in Iran has become even more brutal and fierce. However, there is no doubt that in the current international situation, the status quo in Iran cannot continue for long. Under the leadership of the working class and inspired by the growing anti-imperialist struggle of the people of all countries, the Iranian people will surely break the chains of slavery and win independence, freedom, and liberation.

    英勇不屈的人民战士
    ——纪念伊朗人民党中央委员霍斯劳·鲁兹贝赫殉难两周年
    伊朗　茜玛
    伊朗人民忠实的儿子，伊朗人民党中央委员霍斯劳·鲁兹贝赫同志已经殉难两周年了。两年以前，伊朗反动派用美国的枪弹屠杀了这位伊朗的人民英雄，但是伊朗人民并没有被美国的枪弹所吓倒，他们正在为祖国的真正独立进行着顽强的斗争。
    大家还记得1953年伊朗所发生的不幸的事件：美国和英国帝国主义者勾结起来在伊朗策划了反动的军事政变，以摩萨台为首的当时的民族阵线政府被推翻了。曾经被人民赶跑的伊朗最反动的封建势力的代表国王穆罕默德·礼萨·巴列维又重新回到伊朗；已经被伊朗收归国有的石油企业重又落入了帝国主义垄断资本的手里。美帝国主义的殖民势力大举侵入了伊朗，重新扶植以国王为首的反动势力，把伊朗人民投入了新的更加沉重的灾难的深渊。
    自从那个时候起，美伊反动派对人民发动了血腥的白色恐怖。根据美国人直接的命令，伊朗的监狱里和流放地很快就充斥了不甘屈服于帝国主义奴役的爱国者。每天都有伊朗的爱国者被绑上绞架，而刽子手巴列维则按照美国主子的指示，在处死伊朗爱国志士的判决书上签下自己可憎的名字。
    打着“专家”和“顾问”的幌子来到伊朗的美国间谍，是对伊朗自由战士们施行严刑折磨的直接指使者。为了把“可疑分子”从军队中清洗出去，有六百名优秀的伊朗军官仅仅因为他们有革命思想，被捕并投入监狱，其中一部分被杀害了。
    反动政变发生后的四年中，伊朗的进步力量遭到很大的摧残，但是白色恐怖绝不能够消灭伊朗的进步力量，伊朗人民党保留下来的力量在霍斯劳·鲁兹贝赫的领导下继续进行了反对帝国主义和黑暗的反动势力的斗争。
    霍斯劳·鲁兹贝赫是伊朗军队的著名的和天才的青年军官之一。他所进行的反对国王、皇室和军队指挥官的糜烂生活的斗争，已经在十五年前就引起了反动派对他的仇视和憎恨。
    他写的第一本书名为“盲目的服从”。这本书批评了伊朗军队中的暴虐制度，对年青军官、上层军官和士兵发生了重要的影响。
    1945年由于迫害，他不得不转入地下。在十三年的地下斗争中，他曾三次被伊朗傀儡政府逮捕，但三次都借助朋友的帮助而逃脱了敌人的魔掌。
    1955—1957年间，伊朗反动政府在美国人的直接策划下破坏了伊朗的民族运动及其先锋队——伊朗人民党。这时集体屠杀、恐怖和监禁使人民陷于困难的处境。霍斯劳·鲁兹贝赫同志冒着性命的危险，集合了党的分散了的力量，组织了并巩固了党的地下组织。党继续领导人民进行斗争，给予帝国主义和伊朗反动派以很大的威胁。
    霍斯劳·鲁兹贝赫的名字使美伊反动派感到害怕。因此，敌人动员了所有的力量来逮捕他，终于在1957年由于几个叛徒的出卖。霍斯劳·鲁兹贝赫被捕了。这对伊朗反动政府来说是一个“胜利”。美国人对国王反对共产主义的“功勋”又给了一次奖赏。
    自从霍斯劳·鲁兹贝赫被捕后，敌人满心希望用自己的方式（野兽的方式），彻底消灭人民党。反动派野蛮地向鲁兹贝赫施行报复，因为他在建立和发展伊朗爱好自由的军官的工作中起了巨大的作用。他们用酷刑强迫他向国王求饶，并企图用这些伎俩来进行宣传，以巩固国王的不稳的王位。
    但是，美帝国主义和伊朗反动派残酷的刑罚都不可能摧毁鲁兹贝赫钢铁般的意志。在他被捕以后，还是从监狱和刑室里向人民发出了保卫党、保卫自己正义的信仰的呼声。这种坚毅不拔的革命精神，冲破监狱的铁门，燃起了人们的心，给了人民以巨大的力量。
    敌人用无数次的拷问要求鲁兹贝赫请求国王宽恕，但他说：“这个国王请求人民宽恕他的无数罪行；但人民永远不会宽恕他！”
    当拷问已没有用处的时候，敌人搞了另外一个毒辣计划。国王的特务人员对他说，如果他同意写封信给国王，并请求宽恕过去的事的话，他就可以活下去。但是，鲁兹贝赫回答说：“除了为人民和祖国服务外，别的什么也不干。我既不会向国王，也不会向政府其他的负责人请求宽恕，我认为任何这类请求都是有损一个共产党员的尊严的。”最后，敌人对迫使他屈服这一点已经绝望。国王下令尽快准备法庭审判他。
    一个完全安排好了的所谓法庭在监狱内组织起来。事先就被授意准备好判决书的刽子手们，穿上军事法庭法官的服装坐上了法官的席位，他们仅仅用一天时间就“审理”了这个被军事检察官认为由六千条罪状构成的特殊案件，并作出了死刑的判决。
    霍斯劳·鲁兹贝赫在法庭上作了八个小时的控诉词，它是反对帝国主义及腐朽的反动势力的一个正义凛然的控告书。他的话像子弹一样击中了敌人的要害，他在法庭上顽强地捍卫了自己的政治信仰，他说：“我为我是伊朗人民党党员而自豪，并且无限珍惜自己在党员表上的签名；我认为伊朗人民党是谋求伊朗人民解放的唯一政党。即使你们把我放在火里烧一百次，我仍然还是人民党的党员，因为我的身体的全部细胞都是属于党的。”
    霍斯劳·鲁兹贝赫毫不含糊地承认自己是共产党人，并认为共产主义是人类自由的唯一道路。他说：“我毫不怀疑社会主义必将在全世界胜利，即使到那时候我的骨头已变成灰”。
    他抨击政变以后的反民族政府的对外政策，并认为把伊朗拖入巴格达条约集团是依附于帝国主义战争政策的结果。
    当检察官控告他触犯了君主立宪政体时，他回答：“是甚么样的君主立宪政体呢？这种控告就像你口袋里不名一文而控告我偷你的钱一样。在伊朗不存在让我触犯它的君主立宪政体。在伊朗，宪法完全被国王和统治集团的独裁利益所歪曲和践踏了。”
    在回答要求把他作为瓦尔米亚党组织的奠基人而判处死刑的军事检察官的起诉书时，鲁兹贝赫说：“虽然我认为对我和我的同志们的死刑判决是不公正的，并认为所有这些判决都是不公正和不合法的，但是我感到骄傲的是，我将作为爱好自由的伊朗军官组织的奠基人被枪决。”
    伊朗最高法院也批准了死刑判决。1958年5月11日那天，这个勇敢、无畏和战斗的伊朗人民的儿子就被刽子手们杀害了。
    自从美英帝国主义在伊朗反动统治集团的帮助下，把伊朗变为自己的活动场所以来，已经有七年了。“中央条约组织”的侵略集团和美伊双边军事协定把伊朗变成了反对友好邻国——苏联、伊拉克和阿富汗的军事基地。伊朗追随着帝国主义者的侵略政策，日益走上同和平民主与社会主义阵营断绝关系的道路，并且通过军事条约一天天加深着对和平和全人类最凶恶的敌人的依附。
    由于执行帝国主义的战争政策，我国的经济发生了严重的危机，国家预算的50至60％被用于军费开支。贫困和失业笼罩着伊朗人民的生活。反动派拿子弹来对付最微小的抗议和反对。工人的罢工运动遭到血腥镇压。甚至对抗议殖民教育制度的青年学生也开枪射击。
    近年来，当国际上的力量对比起了有利于和平和社会主义阵营的急剧变化，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国的民族民主革命运动不断地取得胜利，特别是在伊拉克革命爆发之后，帝国主义在伊朗的统治就更加残暴和凶狠了。但是，毫无疑问，在目前的国际形势下，伊朗的现状是不可能长此继续下去的。伊朗人民在工人阶级的领导下和在各国人民日益增长的反对帝国主义斗争的鼓舞下，一定会挣断奴隶的锁链，赢得独立自由和解放。
