Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 25th: According to a report from Vientiane, the capital of Laos, cited by the Vietnam News Agency today, Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front Party, and seven other leaders of the party, escaped from a prison three kilometers from Vientiane on the morning of the 24th. Prince Souphanouvong and his comrades were arrested by the pro-American Lao authorities in July 1959. Prior to this, under the orders of US imperialism, the pro-American reactionary clique violated the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements, betrayed their obligations, ignited a civil war, and took retaliatory measures against former Pathet Lao fighting forces personnel.

The Lao authorities had planned to interrogate Prince Souphanouvong and his comrades, but under the resolute struggle of the Lao people and the strong protests of public opinion at home and abroad, they had to postpone the interrogation repeatedly.

    老挝爱国战线党中央委员会主席
    苏发努冯亲王逃出万象监狱
    党的七位其他领导人也同时逃出
    新华社河内25日电　据越南通讯社今天援引来自老挝首都万象的消息说，老挝爱国战线党中央委员会主席苏发努冯亲王和这个党的七位其他领导人已经在24日清晨从离万象三公里的监狱中逃出来。苏发努冯亲王和他的战友是被亲美的老挝当局在1959年7月逮捕的。在这之前，在美帝国主义的命令下，亲美的反动集团违反日内瓦协议和万象协议，背弃了自己的义务，燃起了内战，对前寮国战斗部队人员采取了报复措施。
    老挝当局曾经计划审讯苏发努冯亲王和他的战友，但是在老挝人民的坚决斗争和国内外公众舆论的强烈抗议下，不得不一再推迟审讯。
