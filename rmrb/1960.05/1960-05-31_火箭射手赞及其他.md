    Praise for Rocket Gunners
    The Soviet rocket forces shot down the American U-2 reconnaissance plane that invaded Soviet airspace, which played a huge role in exposing the hideous face of the imperialists and raising the vigilance of peace-loving people around the world. The Chinese people held demonstrations of more than 50 million people to firmly support the Soviet Union's solemn stance on the Four-Power Summit and are determined to work with the people of the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries, as well as the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, to strike at aggressors at any time.
    I wrote a few lines of poetry praising the Soviet rocket gunners:
    You are truly unfailing in your aim,
    One shot sends the enemy tumbling down;
    You are truly meticulous,
    Firmly grasping the robber's black hand!
    You didn't let this black guest ignite,
    Preserving living proof for it,
    The box contained not weather instruments,
    But photographs of Soviet airfields.
    Your marksmanship is worthy of pride,
    You shot down two birds with one arrow:
    Not only hitting the nature of imperialism,
    But also piercing the demons who depend on American imperialism!
    Robbers provoking China,
    Don't forget that we are descendants of Hou Yi,
    Just listen to the sound of the bowstring,
    And we'll send you tumbling down in a cloud of black smoke!
  What I Saw in Ukraine
    In the spring of 1949, when I passed through Ukraine, I could still see traces of the Soviet Patriotic War everywhere. On the vast and fertile plains, here and there lay the tanks left behind by the fleeing German fascists. On the rusted and moss-covered armor, one could see the ugly swastika emblems. When passing through Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, my eyes were filled with ruins, especially on the small mountain where the patriotic soldiers and civilians were buried, rows of crosses stood. This aroused our lofty respect for the Soviet people's heroes and martyrs, and our boundless anger at the crimes of the Nazi invaders.
    Today, such traces of war are almost impossible to find in the Soviet Union, in Ukraine. Except for the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution in Moscow in 1957, when a grand and moving scene from the Patriotic War was specially arranged in front of a national building.
    Under the favorable situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind, we must not relax our vigilance against the enemy. The war-mongering American imperialists openly stated that this was their established national policy after their aggressive conspiracy was exposed. In addition to continuing large-scale arms expansion and war preparations, and controlling aggressive military blocs, they are also stepping up the revival of West German and Japanese militarism, on one hand, canceling restrictions on West German arms expansion, and on the other hand, directing Nobusuke Kishi to forcibly pass the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, in order to rearm these two "culprits" of World War II and turn them into pawns for launching aggressive wars, threatening world peace.
    As long as we further accelerate and strengthen our own construction and unity, and persist in the struggle against imperialist aggressors, we will be able to effectively prevent new wars. If imperialist war maniacs dare to play with fire, we will certainly be able to finally eliminate imperialism!

    火箭射手赞及其他

    火箭射手赞
    苏联的火箭部队一发射落了侵入苏联领空的美国U—2型侦察机，对暴露帝国主义者凶恶面目，提高全世界爱好和平人民的警惕性起了巨大作用。中国人民举行了五千多万人的大示威坚决支持苏联对四国首脑会议的严正立场，并决心和苏联等兄弟国家人民，亚、非、拉丁美洲人民一道，随时打击侵略者。
    写了几句诗赞颂苏联的火箭射手：
    你们真是矢无虚发，
    一发就让敌人栽跟斗；
    你们真是粗中有细，
    紧紧抓住了强盗的黑手！
    你们没有让这位黑色客人发火，
    替它留下了活生生的证件，
    镜箱里也不是什么气象材料，
    而是苏联飞机场的照片。
    你们的射术足以自豪，
    竟一箭射落了双雕：
    既命中了帝国主义的本性，
    也穿透了依附美帝的群妖！
    向中国挑衅的强盗们，
    也别忘了我们是后羿的子孙，
    但听得弓弦一响，
    准叫你们冒着黑烟乱滚！
  乌克兰所见
    1949年春过乌克兰，还到处看得到苏联卫国战争的斑痕。广漠肥沃的平原上这里那里还横躺着德国法西斯溃走时留下的坦克，发锈生苔的铁甲上可以看得见丑恶的卐字徽记。过乌克兰首府基辅城的时候满眼是颓垣断壁，特别是小山上卫国军民埋骨的地方排列着无数的十字架。引起我们对苏联人民英烈的崇高敬意和对纳粹侵略者的罪恶无比的愤怒。
    在今天，这样的战争痕迹在苏联，在乌克兰几乎是找不到了。除了1957年莫斯科纪念十月革命四十年的时候，曾在一个国家建筑物前面特意布置了卫国战争中一个壮烈动人的场面。
    在东风压倒西风的有利形势下丝毫不容许我们放松对敌人的警惕。好战成性的美帝国主义者在他的侵略阴谋被暴露以后还公然声称这是他们的既定国策。除了继续进行大规模的扩军备战活动，控制侵略性军事集团之外还加紧复活西德和日本军国主义，一面取消对西德扩军的限制，一面指使岸信介武力通过日美军事同盟条约，以便把这两个第二次世界大战的“祸首”再武装起来，成为发动侵略战争的爪牙，威胁世界和平。
    只要我们进一步加速加强自己的建设和团结，坚持对帝国主义侵略者的斗争，必能有效阻止新的战争。帝国主义战争狂人如胆敢玩火，我们必能最后消灭帝国主义！
