Xinhua News Agency, May 20th: Before leaving Beijing today, the Vice Premier of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, Krim Belkacem, reiterated firmly: To win national independence and world peace, the Algerian people will carry the struggle through to the end. He also said that, like China, we will forever bury the monster of colonialism and seek happiness for our people.

The delegation of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, headed by Vice Premier Krim Belkacem, left Beijing by plane this morning after concluding its friendly visit to China.

Vice Premier He Long went to the airport to see off the envoys of the fighting Algerian people. In his speech, he emphasized that no matter what pressure or tricks the French and American imperialists exert on Algeria, as long as the determined Algerian people and the people of the world who oppose imperialism unite, cooperate with each other, and persist in the struggle, they will certainly be able to defeat them thoroughly in the not too distant future. Vice Premier He Long said: "The future definitely belongs to the Algerian people."

Also present at the airport to see them off today were Vice Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs Chen Yi, Vice Premier and Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Luo Ruiqing, Vice Premier Xi Zhongxun, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ji Pengfei, and others.

The national flags of China and Algeria flew high at the Capital Airport. Vice Premier Krim Belkacem, accompanied by Vice Premiers He Long and Chen Yi, reviewed the honor guard. All the distinguished guests received flowers presented by young women of the capital.

In his speech, Vice Premier He Long said that although the Algerian guests stayed in China for a short time, they brought the Chinese people the lofty fighting friendship of the Algerian people and left our people with extremely deep memories. Vice Premier He Long, on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, once again expressed his heartfelt thanks for the Algerian Republic Provisional Government delegation's gracious visit.

Vice Premier He Long said that your visit to our country at our invitation has made a significant contribution to consolidating and developing the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Algeria. Our two governments have reached satisfactory agreement on issues of common concern to our two countries through friendly and cordial talks and have issued a joint communiqué. This clearly marks the further consolidation and development of the fighting friendship between our two governments and peoples.

Vice Premier He Long said that the current international situation is very favorable to the Algerian people's struggle for national independence. The imperialist camp headed by the United States is unprecedentedly isolated and faces a crisis of widespread opposition and disintegration. Their lifespan will certainly not be long. He said that the future definitely belongs to the Algerian people.

Vice Premier He Long said, we would especially like to mention a wish of the Chinese government and the Chinese people here, which is to ask you to convey our deep sympathy and resolute support to the entire Algerian people. Please take back to the Algerian people the cordial greetings and sincere friendship of the 650 million Chinese people. Vice Premier He Long finally shouted: Long live the victory of the Algerian people's national liberation struggle! Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Algerian people! Long live Asian-African solidarity and friendly cooperation! Long live world peace!

In his farewell speech, Vice Premier Krim Belkacem said that we are leaving this great country and its great people with a feeling of deep regret. Like us, the Chinese people have suffered the humiliation of colonial rule in the past, so they understand our suffering and understand our problems better than others. The Chinese people share a common destiny with us, and we are naturally united because of our opposition to imperialism. Although imperialism has various faces, it is still imperialism after all.

Vice Premier Krim Belkacem said that currently, our national independence and world peace are threatened by colonialism and imperialism. He firmly stated that the Algerian people are determined to carry the struggle through to the end.

He said that the People's Republic of China is a source of wisdom. Today, it is a source of experience that is completely dedicated to the happiness of the people and has achieved success and is admirable. It has set an example of hard work, courage, and confidence in the bright future of mankind. The People's Republic of China is a lighthouse, and the hearts of people like us in the storm yearn for this lighthouse.

He said that the Algerian Provisional Government delegation is deeply moved by the warm and fraternal hospitality of the Chinese people and the Chinese government from beginning to end. The delegation will faithfully convey the cordial greetings of the people, army, and government of the People's Republic of China and their wishes full of confidence in their victory to the Algerian people and the National Liberation Army. Vice Premier Krim Belkacem said, let me once again shout: Long live the great People's Republic of China! Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Algerian people! Long live Asian-African solidarity! Long live world peace!

Their speeches were warmly applauded.

Also present at the airport to see them off today were responsible persons of government departments, democratic parties, people's organizations, senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and people from all walks of life in the capital. Envoys and diplomatic officials from various countries stationed in China also went to the airport to see them off. (Attached picture)

    新华社20日讯　阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府副总理克里姆·贝勒卡塞姆，今天在离开北京前再一次坚定地表示：为了争取民族独立和世界和平，阿尔及利亚人民将把斗争坚持到底。他还说，像中国一样，我们将永远埋葬殖民主义这个怪物，为我们的人民谋幸福。
    以克里姆·贝勒卡塞姆副总理为首的阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团，在结束了对中国的友好访问之后，今天上午乘飞机离开北京。
    国务院副总理贺龙元帅前往机场欢送战斗的阿尔及利亚人民的使者。他在讲话中强调指出，不管法国和美国帝国主义对阿尔及利亚施加什么压力，玩弄什么诡计，只要斗志坚强的阿尔及利亚人民和全世界反对帝国主义的人民一起，互相合作，坚持斗争，就一定能够在不很久的将来把它们彻底打败。贺龙副总理说：“未来的日子肯定是属于阿尔及利亚人民的”。
    今天到机场欢送的，还有国务院副总理兼外交部长陈毅元帅，国务院副总理、中国人民解放军总参谋长罗瑞卿大将，国务院副总理习仲勋，全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员长郭沫若，外交部副部长姬鹏飞等。
    首都机场上高高飘扬着中国和阿尔及利亚两国的国旗。克里姆·贝勒卡塞姆副总理由贺龙、陈毅两位副总理陪同，检阅了仪仗队。全体贵宾接受了首都女青年的献花。
    贺龙副总理在讲话中说，阿尔及利亚贵宾在中国停留的时间虽然不长，但是给中国人民带来了阿尔及利亚人民的崇高的战斗友谊，给我国人民留下极其深刻的记忆。贺龙副总理代表中国政府和中国人民对阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团的盛情访问，再一次表示衷心的感谢。
    贺龙副总理说，你们这次应邀来我国访问，对于巩固和发展中阿两国间的友好合作关系作出了重大贡献。我们两国政府已经通过友好亲切的会谈，就我们两国共同有关的问题，满意地取得了一致的意见，并且发表了联合公报。这鲜明地标志着我们两国政府和人民的战斗友谊有了进一步的巩固和发展。
    贺龙副总理说，当前的国际局势对阿尔及利亚人民的民族独立斗争十分有利，以美国为首的帝国主义阵营空前孤立，面临着众叛亲离、四分五裂的危机，它们的寿命肯定不会很长了。他说，未来的日子肯定是属于阿尔及利亚人民的。
    贺龙副总理说，我们在这里特别提到中国政府和中国人民的一项愿望，就是请你们向全体阿尔及利亚人民转达我们的深切同情和坚决支持。请你们带回六亿五千万中国人民对阿尔及利亚人民的亲切问候和诚挚友谊。贺龙副总理最后高呼：阿尔及利亚人民的民族解放斗争胜利万岁！中阿两国人民的友谊万岁！亚非团结和友好合作万岁！世界和平万岁！
    克里姆·贝勒卡塞姆副总理在告别讲话中说，我们怀着十分惜别的心情离开这个伟大的国家和伟大的人民。像我们一样，中国人民过去曾经遭受殖民统治的屈辱，因此，他们比旁人更了解我们的痛苦，懂得我们的问题。中国人民和我们共命运，由于反对帝国主义，我们就自然地团结在一起。虽然帝国主义有各种各样的面目，但是终究是帝国主义。
    克里姆·贝勒卡塞姆副总理说，目前，我们的民族独立和世界和平都受到殖民主义和帝国主义的威胁。他坚定地表示，阿尔及利亚人民决心要把斗争坚持到底。
    他说，中华人民共和国是智慧的源泉。今天，它是完全为人民谋幸福，而且是获得了成功的和令人赞佩的经验的源泉。它树立了勤劳勇敢和对人类美好的前途充满信心的榜样。中华人民共和国是一座灯塔，像我们这些处于暴风雨中的人们的心都向往着这一座灯塔。
    他说，阿尔及利亚临时政府代表团对中国人民和中国政府自始至终热情的、兄弟般的款待深为感动。代表团将忠实的把中华人民共和国人民、军队和政府的亲切问候和对他们的胜利的充满着信心的祝愿转达给阿尔及利亚人民和民族解放军。克里姆·贝勒卡塞姆副总理说，让我再一次高呼：伟大的中华人民共和国万岁！中阿两国人民友谊万岁！亚非团结万岁！世界和平万岁！
