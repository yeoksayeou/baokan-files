Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 6th—Seoul dispatch: South Korea's new puppet, Heo Jeong, under the direction of his master, the United States, is stepping up his efforts to make "democratic" gestures and issue various promises to deceive the South Korean people. This is in order to ease the anger of the South Korean people against the fascist rule of the US-Syngman Rhee clique and to maintain America's colonial rule.

At a press conference held in Seoul on the 5th, Heo Jeong shamelessly babbled that his regime would "respect public opinion," "welcome constructive criticism," carry out "revolutionary reforms," "guarantee" that the next election would be held in a "free and fair atmosphere," and "guarantee punishment" of those responsible for the previous fraudulent election, and so on.

However, his true face as an American puppet, just like Syngman Rhee, was also exposed in his speech at the press conference. He threatened the South Korean people not to call him a traitor.

He said that accusing the United States of interfering in Korean affairs "will help the communist enemies."

He also unreservedly revealed his ugly pro-American attitude, defending the deceptive conspiracy recently orchestrated by the United States in South Korea, saying that "I think the opinions of the United States are good and friendly."

Heo Jeong also expressed his intention to continue to implement the conspiracy of the US-Syngman Rhee clique to try their best to undermine the return of Korean residents in Japan to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. He said that once Japan stops repatriating Korean residents, the "Japan-South Korea talks" can be resumed.

He also expressed his welcome to Nobusuke Kishi, an accomplice in the United States' aggressive policy in the Far East, to visit Seoul.

Prior to this, the Heo Jeong puppet regime had already issued a "government statement" on May 3, stating that it would oppose communism "more actively than before."

At the same time, the United States is also cheering on its new puppet. An Associated Press dispatch from South Korea on the 6th said that US Army officers stationed in South Korea "like" the Heo Jeong regime "and believe it will effectively oppose communism." "They are particularly pleased with these signs: South Korea may become friends with Japan." Heo Jeong revealed on the 5th that the US "Ambassador" to South Korea had told him that the United States would give him "more assistance."

All these facts prove that Heo Jeong is just another puppet fostered by the United States.

    在美国主子的导演下
    新傀儡许政加紧施展欺骗伎俩
    新华社平壤6日电　汉城消息：南朝鲜新傀儡许政，在他的主子美国导演下，正加紧作出“民主”姿态，发出各种诺言，来欺骗南朝鲜人民，以便缓和南朝鲜人民反对美、李集团的法西斯统治的激愤情绪，并维持美国的殖民统治。
    许政5日在汉城举行的记者招待会上，厚颜无耻地胡诌什么他的政权“将尊重舆论”，“欢迎建设性的批评”，要进行“革命改革”，“保证”下一次选举将在“自由和公平的气氛中举行”，“保证惩罚”对上次的伪选应当负责的人等等。
    但是他同李承晚一样是美国傀儡的真面目，也就在记者招待会上的讲话中暴露无遗。他威胁南朝鲜人民不要骂他卖国。
    他说，指责美国干涉朝鲜事务“将有助于共产党敌人”。
    他还毫不遮掩他的媚美丑态，为美国最近在南朝鲜导演的欺骗阴谋辩护，说什么“我认为美国的意见是良好的，并且是友好的”。
    许政还表示继续执行美李集团竭力破坏旅日朝鲜侨民回返朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的阴谋。他说，日本一旦停止遣返朝鲜侨民，“日韩会谈”即可恢复。
    他还表示欢迎美国在远东侵略政策的帮凶岸信介去汉城访问。
    在这以前，许政傀儡政权已在5月3日发表“政府声明”，表示要“比以前更加积极地”反共。
    同时，美国也在对它的新傀儡打气。美联社6日从南朝鲜发出的一条电讯说，驻在南朝鲜的美国陆军军官“都喜欢”许政政权，“认为它将有效地反共”。“他们对于这些迹象表示特别高兴：南朝鲜可能同日本作朋友”。许政在5日透露，美国驻南朝鲜“大使”已经告诉他，美国将给他“更多的援助”。
    所有这些事实都证明许政只不过是美国扶植的另一个傀儡。
