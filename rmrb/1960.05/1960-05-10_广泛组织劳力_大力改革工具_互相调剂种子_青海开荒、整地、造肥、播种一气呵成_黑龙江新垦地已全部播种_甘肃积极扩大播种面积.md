    Broadly Organize Labor, Vigorously Reform Tools, Mutually Adjust Seeds
    Qinghai Completes Land Reclamation, Tillage, Fertilizer Production, and Sowing in One Go
    Heilongjiang's Newly Reclaimed Land Has Been Fully Sown; Gansu Actively Expands Sown Area

    This newspaper reports that the people of all ethnic groups in Qinghai Province are fighting hard in the Red May, seizing the time to both reclaim and sow land, striving for more planting and more harvesting. Reclaiming land while sowing is a major measure for the people of all ethnic groups in Qinghai Province to implement the provincial party committee's policy of "taking land reclamation as the key, and combining expanding cultivated land area with increasing yield per unit area." In the vast rural areas and grasslands, more than 400,000 able-bodied laborers (accounting for half of the province's total agricultural labor force) have been put into the land reclamation and sowing front. Currently, of the more than 6.5 million mu of wasteland newly reclaimed since last winter and this spring, more than 2.8 million mu have been rush-planted with various crops.

    Large-scale land reclamation and increased grain planting are of great significance for the construction of Qinghai. In recent years, due to the rapid development of socialist construction in Qinghai Province, the population has increased significantly, and the demand for grain has become greater and greater. Qinghai has extremely rich mineral resources, and to run industries on a large scale and rapidly change the face of Qinghai, agriculture needs to provide sufficient grain and industrial raw materials; the great development of animal husbandry also requires a large increase in feed. Qinghai has a large amount of fertile reclaimable land, and there is great potential for agricultural development. People of all ethnic groups deeply realize the strategic significance of running agriculture on a large scale for the construction of Qinghai. Therefore, the determination and drive to reclaim land and expand the sown area are great. Last winter, people of all ethnic groups braved the wind, snow and severe cold to reclaim 3.83 million mu of wasteland in one go, equivalent to more than half of last year's sown area, with each laborer reclaiming more than four mu. This year, under the leadership of the Party, the masses have greater determination and ambition, planning to reclaim more than nine mu per laborer, and to reclaim and sow at the same time, striving to double the sown area compared to last year.

    In order to save time and free up labor for land reclamation, people of all ethnic groups appropriately advanced the sowing period for dry land crops. In early April, after planting spring wheat and highland barley on the original more than 7 million mu of mature land, they launched the first battle of the great march to the wasteland, taking advantage of the gaps. The three armies of people's communes, state farms, and government cadres were dispatched together. Everyone reclaimed and sowed at the same time, planting late-season crops on part of the wasteland reclaimed last year, while also newly reclaiming a large amount of wasteland, with each laborer expanding cultivated land by nearly three mu on average.

    In order to ensure that the newly reclaimed land is sown immediately, party organizations at all levels have done a lot of work in eliminating the concerns of the masses, arranging labor, and allocating seeds. At first, some people in some areas were concerned that the new wasteland would not grow good crops in the current year. The party organization conducted propaganda and education for the masses based on the actual examples of high yields obtained in the current year by sowing new wasteland in previous years, and at the same time explained that the newly reclaimed land has great fertility and is particularly suitable for planting rapeseed and potatoes. In order to solve the labor problem, Minhe and other counties organized various specialized teams to fight on different fronts, dividing and combining the work of land reclamation, tillage, fertilizer production, and sowing in an assembly line operation, so as to reclaim and sow at the same time.

    The land reclamation army in Huzhu, Huangyuan, and other counties is equipped with three tools per person (shovel, sledgehammer, rake), and after reclaiming the land, they break up the soil, level the land, and prepare for sowing.

    The technical revolution movement in agricultural production has also saved a lot of labor and promoted the progress of spring sowing. Delingha Farm in the Qaidam Basin converted the wooden tile bearings of seeders, disc harrows, and other machines into ball bearings, reducing friction. A medium-sized tractor can carry five seeders and sow more than 1,500 mu per day.

    Some areas do not have enough seeds, so they mutually adjust seeds based on the spirit of communist cooperation and the principle of equivalent exchange; at the same time, they adopt the method of planting whatever seeds they have to solve the difficulty of seed shortage. Farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups also put forward the slogan of "eat one less bite, plant one more point," and tried to save food for sowing. Local government agencies, factories, mines, troops, and schools also actively saved food to support the needs of sowing.

    In order to seize the season, the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee called on the entire party and the entire people to mobilize and fight another decisive battle in May to fully complete the sowing task. The party's call received a positive response. In addition to the labor force that originally persisted on the spring sowing front, government agencies, factories, mines, schools, and troops at all levels further properly arranged work, study, and production, and extracted all possible manpower to further support sowing. As a result, the progress of sowing was greatly accelerated. In addition to completing the planting of the original mature land and the wasteland reclaimed last winter, Minhe County has also planted 200,000 mu of the 420,000 mu of wasteland newly opened this spring. In Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, the source of the Yangtze River and the Yellow River, the Tibetan people who have always engaged in animal husbandry are in high spirits, reclaiming and sowing land side by side with government cadres and stationed troops, determined to establish a new agricultural base at the source of the rivers. They have already sown 690,000 mu, equivalent to three and a half times the sown area last year.

    This newspaper reports that under the guidance of the principles of multiple planting, high yield, and more harvesting, state farms and people's communes in various parts of Heilongjiang Province have sown soybeans, wheat, corn, and other crops on the more than 800,000 mu of land that has been reclaimed.

    With the large-scale reclamation of wasteland, the land area of ​​Heilongjiang Province has expanded year by year. In the past ten years, more than 20 million mu of wasteland has been reclaimed, but there is still a large amount of fertile wasteland waiting to be reclaimed. Based on the principle of fully utilizing existing cultivated land area and expanding cultivated land area at the same time, the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee called on all parts of the province to make greater efforts to reclaim wasteland. This year, the reclamation area in the Hejiang Reclamation Area will be equal to 1.5 times the actual sown area last year.

    Now, from the Heilongjiang River to the shores of Jingbo Lake in the south, from the Nenjiang Plain to both sides of the Songhua River, large numbers of tractors and new agricultural implements have been dispatched everywhere to reclaim the fertile wasteland. This year, due to the state farm workers and people's commune members reforming a large number of tractor-drawn plows, planters, and harrow-planters, they can reclaim and sow at the same time, greatly improving work efficiency and expanding the sown area of ​​land reclamation. More than 80,000 mu of the more than 100,000 mu of land newly opened in the Hejiang Reclamation Area have been sown. This year, this reclamation area plans to sow more than 60% of the newly reclaimed wasteland with soybeans. Hailun County has sown wheat on the wasteland that has been reclaimed, and will continue to sow soybeans, corn, potatoes, and other crops. This county plans to plant food, flax, autumn vegetables, and feed crops on the more than 370,000 mu of wasteland to be reclaimed this year according to different seasons. 75% of the newly reclaimed land in the Friendship State Farm will be sown with various grains and feed. One-third of the total reclamation area in the province will be sown with food, cash crops, and feed, etc. (Zhang Zhi)

    According to a Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Lanzhou, Gansu Province is actively sowing new reclaimed land and using small plots of land to expand the sown area. As of April 25, the amount of grain, cotton, oilseeds, sugar beets and other industrial raw material crops sown throughout the province increased by 25% compared with the same period last year.

    Doing everything possible to expand the sown area is one of the important measures taken by the Gansu Provincial Party Committee to lead the people of the province in winning a large increase in agricultural production. In Gannan, the Hexi Corridor, and the Ziwuling area of ​​eastern Gansu, people braved the severe cold to set off a land reclamation upsurge before the ice melted. Since last winter, the province's 126 state-owned farms and ranches have reclaimed a total of more than 1.3 million mu of land, and spring sowing has reached more than 720,000 mu.

    In order to sow new reclaimed land in a timely manner, state-owned farms and ranches organized two sets of people, one side reclaiming land and the other side tilling and harrowing, repairing canals, and using turf for fertilizer on the spot. The Taojiang County State-owned Farm and Ranch created a five-legged cultivator suitable for sowing new reclaimed land, which accelerated the sowing speed. The people's communes in various places have newly cultivated more than 400,000 mu of cultivated land, most of which have been sown.

    The people's communes in Zhangye Prefecture reduced fallow land and launched a surprise multiple sowing campaign. Various places have also made full use of scattered land to carry out a "double hundred jin" movement to increase the income of 100 jin of potatoes and 100 jin of pumpkins per labor force. Workers, peasants, cadres, students, troops, and urban residents throughout the province have used vacant land in front of and behind their houses and "ten edges" to plant "lying ox fields" and "standing human fields." As of April 25, the province has planted a total of more than 570,000 mu of potatoes, pumpkins, and vegetables, etc. (excluding farmland sowing). (Attached photo)

    广泛组织劳力　大力改革工具　互相调剂种子
    青海开荒、整地、造肥、播种一气呵成
    黑龙江新垦地已全部播种　甘肃积极扩大播种面积
    本报讯　青海省各族人民大战红5月，抓紧时机边开荒边播种，力争多种多收。一边开荒一边播种，是青海省各族人民执行省委提出的“以开荒为纲、扩大耕地面积和提高单位面积产量并举”这一方针的一项主要措施。在辽阔的农村和草原，共有四十多万精壮劳力（占全省农业总劳力的一半）投入到开荒和播种战线。目前，去冬今春新开垦的六百五十多万亩荒地中，已有二百八十多万亩突击种上了各类作物。
    大量开荒增种粮食，对建设青海有重大意义。青海省近年来由于社会主义建设事业的迅速发展，人口大量增加，粮食需要量越来越大。青海有极丰富的矿藏资源，要大办工业，迅速改变青海面貌，就需要农业提供足够的粮食和工业原料；畜牧业的大发展，也要求大量增加饲料。青海有大量肥沃可垦荒地，农业发展大有可为。各族人民深深认识到，大办农业对建设青海的战略意义，因而开荒造田、扩大播种面积的决心大、干劲足。去年冬天，各族人民冒着风雪严寒，一鼓作气开荒三百八十三万亩，相当去年播种面积的一半以上，每个劳力开荒造田四亩多。今年广大群众在党的领导下，决心和雄心更大，每个劳力计划开荒九亩多，而且要边开边种，力争播种面积比去年成倍扩大。
    为了争取时间和抽出劳力开荒，各族人民适当提前了旱田作物播种期，在4月初，将原有的七百多万亩熟地种上了春小麦和青稞以后，利用空隙，发动了向荒地大进军的第一个战役。人民公社、国营农场和机关干部三路大军一齐出动。大家边开荒边播种，在去年开垦的一部分荒地上种上了晚田作物，同时又新开垦出大量荒地，每个劳力平均扩大耕地近三亩。
    为了使新开荒地马上播种，各级党组织在消除群众顾虑、安排劳力和调配种子等方面，作了许多工作。起初，有的地区有人顾虑新荒当年种不好庄稼。党组织就以前几年新开荒地当年播种获得高产的实际事例，向群众进行宣传教育，同时说明新垦地肥劲大，特别适宜种油菜、马铃薯。为解决劳力问题，民和等县组织了各种专业队，分线作战，把开荒、整地、造肥、播种各项工作，以流水作业的方式，分工结合，做到一边开荒一边播种。
    互助、湟源等县的开荒大军，每人配备三件工具（铁锨、鎯头、耙子），开了地，接着就打土块，平整土地，准备播种。
    农业生产上的技术革命运动，也节省出大量劳力，推进了春播进度。柴达木盆地德令哈农场，把播种机、圆盘耙等机具的木瓦轴承，改装成滚珠轴承，减少了摩擦力，一台中型拖拉机，可带五台播种机，每天可播种一千五百多亩。
    有些地区种子不够，他们本着共产主义协作精神和等价交换原则，互相调剂种子；同时采取有啥种啥的办法，解决缺种困难。各族农牧民并提出“少吃一口，多种一分”的口号，设法节约粮食进行播种。各地机关、厂矿、部队、学校也积极节约粮食，支援播种需要。
    为了抢季节，中共青海省委号召全党全民齐动员，在5月份再打一个突击战，全面完成播种任务。党的号召一呼百应，除了原来坚持在春播战线上的劳力以外，各级机关、厂矿、学校和部队，都进一步妥善安排工作学习和生产，抽出了一切可以抽出的人力，进一步支援播种，因而播种进度大大加快。民和县除了将原有熟地和在去冬开垦的荒地全部种完以外，今春新开的四十二万亩荒地，也已经种好了二十万亩。在长江、黄河发源地的玉树藏族自治州，一向经营牧业的藏族人民意气风发，和机关干部驻军官兵并肩开荒播种，决心在江河源头建立新的农业基地。他们已经播种六十九万亩，相当于去年播种面积的三倍半。
    本报讯　黑龙江省各地国营农场和人民公社在多种、高产、多收方针的指导下，在已经开垦的八十多万亩土地上，播种了大豆、小麦、苞米等作物。
    随着荒地的大面积开垦，黑龙江省的土地面积逐年扩大。在过去十年中，开垦了两千多万亩荒地，但还有大量肥沃荒地等待开垦。中共黑龙江省委本着充分利用现有耕地面积和扩大耕地面积并举的方针，号召全省各地要以更大的努力进行开荒。今年，合江垦区开垦面积将等于去年实际播种面积的一点五倍。
    现在从黑龙江边到南部的镜泊湖畔，从嫩江平原到松花江两岸，到处出动了大批拖拉机和新式农具，开垦肥沃的荒原。今年由于国营农场职工和人民公社社员改制了大量机引犁播机和耙播机，可以一面开荒一面播种，大大提高了工作效率和扩大了开荒的播种面积。合江垦区新开的十万多亩土地已有八万多亩播了种。今年这个垦区计划要把60％以上的新垦荒地播种上大豆。海伦县在已经开垦的荒地播种了小麦，还要继续播种大豆、苞米、土豆等作物。这个县今年计划开垦的三十七万多亩荒地，都要按不同季节种上粮食、亚麻、秋菜和饲料作物。国营友谊农场新开垦的土地有75％将播种各种粮食和饲料。全省在总开荒面积中将有三分之一的土地播种上粮食、经济作物和饲料等。　（张治）
    据新华社兰州电　甘肃省各地积极播种新开荒地和利用小块土地扩大播种面积。到4月25日止，全省播下的粮食和棉花、油料、甜菜等工业原料作物，比去年同期增加25％。
    千方百计扩大播种面积，是中共甘肃省委领导全省人民夺取农业大增产的重要措施之一。在甘南、河西走廊和陇东子午岭一带，人们在冰消以前就冒着严寒掀起了垦荒热潮。全省一百二十六个国营农牧场从去冬到现在，共开荒地一百三十多万亩，春季播种达七十二万多亩。
    为了及时在新开荒地上播种，各国营农牧场组织了两套人马，一面开荒，一面整地耙耱，兴修渠道，就地利用草皮熏肥。洮江县国营农牧场创制了适宜新开荒地播种的五腿耧，加快了播种速度。各地人民公社新垦耕地四十多万亩，多已播种完毕。
    张掖专区各人民公社缩小轮歇地，开展了突击多播的活动。各地还充分利用零星地，开展每个劳动力增收百斤洋芋、百斤南瓜的“双百斤”运动。全省工人、农民、干部、学生、部队官兵和城市居民，都利用房前屋后的空闲地和“十边”，种“卧牛田”、“站人地”。到4月25日，全省已种植洋芋、南瓜和蔬菜等（不包括农田播种）共五十七万多亩。（附图片）
