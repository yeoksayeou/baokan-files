    Annotations on "Indigenous" and "Simple"
    Yu Yang
    The news that Shanghai has developed and created many new techniques and technologies by combining indigenous and foreign methods, and that coal mine workers across the country have used indigenous and foreign methods to create more than twenty types of simple rock drills, is truly exciting.
    In the minds of some people, the words "indigenous" and "simple" seem to be inherently linked to words like "low-level" and "backward." They believe that indigenous methods are always inferior to foreign ones, and that simple methods are always inferior to complex ones. In fact, the markers of "advanced" versus "low-level," and "advanced" versus "backward" are not distinguished by "indigenous" versus "foreign" methods, or simple versus complex ones. This method of distinction is one-sided, formalistic, and cannot reflect the essence of things. The scientific standard for distinguishing "advanced" from "backward" and "high-level" from "low-level" should be the actual effectiveness of the machine. Using a pickaxe to dig rocks is clearly low-level and backward compared to using a complex pneumatic drill to cut rock. However, once we create an electric drill, the pneumatic drill becomes backward. Structurally, the electric drill is much simpler than the pneumatic drill; in terms of effect, the electric drill is many times better than the pneumatic drill. This clearly shows that simple things are not necessarily backward, and some machines with simplified structures are actually more advanced and higher-level in terms of performance. The development of things is not only a process from simple to complex, but also a process from complex to simple. Whether it is an "indigenous" method or a "foreign" method, under the same conditions, for the same purpose, using the simplest method, with the least materials, and the least amount of time and manpower to achieve a higher effect, this should be a direction of the technological revolution.
    In the technical innovation and technological revolution movements, we have many new major creations in machines, tools, production methods, technological processes, etc. Some are achieved by adopting foreign methods, some are created by absorbing some of the advantages of foreign methods and transforming them, and many more are created by indigenous methods. In short, they are the products of the combination of "foreign methods" and "indigenous methods," foreign experience and Chinese practice, or new developments based on existing foreign experience. Their distinct characteristics are: the structure is simpler than the usual "foreign" methods, easier to manufacture, easier to master, and more efficient and of better quality. These creations should all be affirmed as high-level, advanced, and scientific. Adopt foreign methods where possible, adopt indigenous methods where suitable; this is our established principle for technical innovation and technological revolution. Foreign or indigenous methods, simple or complex, are neither the goal we pursue, nor the markers of high-level versus low-level, advanced versus backward. Our fundamental goal is to achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results. The more we can achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results, the more high-level and advanced we are.
    The idea that "indigenous" and "simple" are "backward" and "low-level" essentially reflects the one-sided pursuit of foreign things and the desire for large-scale operations in people's minds. Countless achievements of the technological revolution are increasingly providing new annotations for "indigenous" and "simple." "Indigenous" and "simple" means having our national characteristics and conforming to the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical results. It is the accumulation of our people's experience and wisdom, and the new creation of our people. In the realm of social science and social revolution, we often emphasize that universal truth must be combined with the actual situation of the Chinese revolution. In the realm of natural science and technological revolution, there can be no exception.

    “土”“简”注
    于羊
    上海用土洋结合的办法发展和创造了许多新工艺、新技术和全国煤矿职工用土洋结合的办法创造二十多种简易岩石电钻的消息，读之实在令人兴奋。
    在某些人的观念中，“土”和“简”这两个字，好像压根儿就是和“低级”、“落后”等字眼连在一起的。他们认为土的总不如洋的，简易的总不如复杂的，其实，“高级”与“低级”，“先进”与“落后”的标志并不是由什么“土”法与“洋”法，简易与复杂来区分的。这种区分方法是片面的、形式主义的，是不能反映事物本质的。“先进”与“落后”，“高级”与“低级”的科学划分标准，应当是机器的实际效用。用铁镐挖岩石，比起用结构复杂的风钻凿岩来，显然是低级的、落后的。可是，当我们创造出电钻以后，风钻就显得落后了。从结构看，电钻比风钻简单得多；从效果看，电钻却比风钻高出好多倍。这里清楚地表明：简单的并不一定是落后的，有些结构简化了的机器，效能上却是更先进、更高级的。事物的发展，不仅是由简到繁的过程，同样还存在着由繁到简的过程，无论是“土”法或
  “洋”法，在同样的条件下，为了同样的目的，用愈简易的办法，用愈少的材料，愈少时间和人力达到更高的效果，这应该是技术革命的一个方向。
    在技术革新和技术革命运动中，我们无论在机器、工具、生产方法、工艺流程等等方面都有许多新的重大创造，有的是采用洋法达到的，有的是吸取了洋法中的一些长处，加以改造创造出来的，更多的则是用土办法创造出来的。总之，它们是“洋法”和“土法”，外国经验和中国实践相结合的产物，或是在外国已有经验基础上的新发展。它们鲜明的特点是：结构比通常的“洋”办法更简单，易于制造，也易于掌握，而且效率更高，质量更好。这一些创造都应当肯定是高级的、先进的、科学的。能洋则洋，能土则土，这就是我们技术革新和技术革命的既定原则。洋法或土法，简易或复杂既不是我们所追求的目的，也不是高级与低级，先进与落后的标志。我们的根本目的是要达到多快好省。愈是能做到多快好省，就愈是高级、先进。
    所谓“土”的、“简易”的就是“落后”的、“低级”的，实质上反映了人们头脑中的片面求洋、贪大的思想。技术革命的无数成果正在愈益明显地替“土”和“简”作出了新的注解。“土”的和“简”的就是具有我国民族特点和符合多快好省原则的，它是我国人民经验和智慧的积累，是我国人民的新创造。在社会科学和社会革命的范畴内，我们常常强调普遍真理必须与中国革命实际相结合，在自然科学和技术革命的范畴内当然也不能例外。
