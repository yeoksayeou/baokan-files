　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 25th: 125,000 Korean residents in Japan held rallies and demonstrations in seventy locations across Japan today, demanding the withdrawal of American troops from South Korea and supporting the South Korean people's patriotic struggle and the Japanese people's struggle against the new Japan-US "Security Treaty."

　　This large-scale anti-American patriotic unified action by Korean residents in Japan was launched under the call of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan. It is also the first struggle in a series of unified anti-American patriotic struggles they plan to conduct until August 15th—the day of Korean liberation.

　　Among those participating in the rally and demonstration held in Tokyo today were 7,200 representatives from 50,000 Korean residents in Tokyo.

　　Han Tok-su, Chairman of the Central Committee of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan, in his speech at the rally, put forward the policy direction for Korean residents in Japan to struggle against American imperialism and save the nation. Han Tok-su emphasized that the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan is prepared to cooperate with patriotic individuals who oppose imperialism and all Korean residents in Japan who hope for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland and the independence of Korea, regardless of what organization they currently belong to or what political experiences they may have had in the past.

　　The rally also decided to write a letter encouraging the South Korean people who are heroically resisting American imperialism.

　　The rally also adopted a protest resolution addressed to U.S. President Eisenhower. The resolution demanded that U.S. troops immediately withdraw from South Korea and that the U.S. cease interfering in Korea's internal affairs. The resolution strongly protested the U.S.'s colonial rule over South Korea. About 300 representatives of Korean residents today went to the U.S. Embassy in Japan to deliver this protest resolution.

　　The rally also passed a statement saying: Although the Syngman Rhee puppet government in South Korea has been overthrown, the fascist and terrorist institutions established by the U.S. and Syngman Rhee remain intact. As long as these sinful institutions continue to exist, the Korean people's desire for freedom, democracy, and improved living standards cannot be realized.

　　The statement demanded the immediate abolition of the South Korean terrorist system, the organization of a provisional administrative body with the participation of people's representatives; the withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea, the convening of a joint conference attended by political parties and social organizations from both North and South Korea to peacefully reunify the fatherland; and the establishment of a joint economic committee composed of representatives from North and South Korea.

　　After the meeting, a parade and demonstration were held. The demonstrators, holding high the flags of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and carrying placards demanding the establishment of people's courts to try Syngman Rhee and overthrowing the Heo Jeong "caretaker cabinet," marched through the main streets of Tokyo.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 25th: News from Seoul: Demonstrations broke out again in Seoul today under the tight guard of the U.S.-Heo Jeong group's military police. More than sixty citizens demonstrated in front of the puppet "National Assembly," demanding the immediate dissolution of the puppet "National Assembly."

　　According to reports, the demonstrators arrived in front of the puppet "National Assembly Hall" at 10:15 a.m. They held placards with slogans such as "Get out, reactionary National Assembly members!" etc. The puppet authorities sent military police and police to violently suppress the demonstration and arrest the demonstrators. At this time, the surrounding masses angrily shouted, "Arrest us all together!" expressing their support for the demonstrators.

　　Encouraged by the masses, the demonstrators rushed into a hotel where Syngman Rhee's Liberal Party members were holding a "Members' Meeting." They broke down the door and rushed into the conference room.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 25th: News from Seoul: The struggle of South Korean workers against fascist rule and the cruel system of exploitation is expanding. According to South Korea's Tonghwa News Agency, more than 3,800 drivers and workers of 620 buses and more than 3,200 taxis in Seoul held an emergency meeting on the 24th and decided to support the struggle of bus workers on the Seoul-Sinchon line demanding the implementation of an eight-hour work system, starting from the 25th. In a resolution, they announced that if their demands were not met, they would "enter into a general strike" starting from the 27th. Bus workers on the Seoul-Sinchon line have been refusing to work after 2:00 p.m. every day since the 22nd in order to improve working conditions and demand an eight-hour workday.

　　According to reports, the South Korean puppet "Minister of Transportation," frightened by the workers' struggle, threatened the workers who decided to strike, saying that if a "very serious incident" occurred, so-called "legal measures" would be taken.

    据新华社25日讯　东京消息：十二万五千名旅日朝鲜侨民今天在日本的七十个地方举行大会和示威，要求美国军队撤出南朝鲜，并且支持南朝鲜人民的爱国斗争和日本人民反对新日美“安全条约”的斗争。
    旅日朝侨这次大规模的反美爱国统一行动，是在旅日朝鲜人总联合会的号召下举行的。这也是他们计划进行到8月15日——朝鲜解放日的一系列反美爱国斗争统一行动的第一次斗争。
    参加今天在东京举行的大会和示威的，有东京五万名朝侨的代表七千二百人。
    旅日朝鲜人总联合会中央委员会议长韩德铢在大会上讲话时，提出了旅日朝侨为反对美帝国主义和救国而斗争的政策方针。韩德铢强调说，旅日朝鲜人总联合会准备同反对帝国主义的爱国人士以及希望和平统一祖国和朝鲜独立的全体旅日朝鲜侨民合作。不论他们目前属于什么团体，或者他们过去可能有什么样的政治经历。
    大会还决定写信鼓励英勇反抗美帝国主义的南朝鲜人民。
    大会还通过了致美国总统艾森豪威尔的抗议决议。决议要求美国军队立即撤出南朝鲜，要求美国停止干涉朝鲜的内政。决议强烈抗议美国对南朝鲜的殖民统治。约有三百名朝鲜侨民代表今天到美国驻日本大使馆去递交了这份抗议决议。
    大会还通过一项声明说：虽然南朝鲜的李承晚傀儡政府被推翻了，但是美国和李承晚建立的法西斯和恐怖机构还是原封未动。只要这种罪恶的机构继续存在，朝鲜人民要求自由、民主和改善生活的愿望就无法实现。
    声明要求立即废除南朝鲜的恐怖制度，组织有人民代表参加的临时行政机构；要求美国军队撤出南朝鲜，召开有南北朝鲜各政党和社会团体参加的联席会议，和平统一祖国；要求建立由南北朝鲜代表组成的联合经济委员会。
    会后举行了游行示威。示威队伍高举着朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的国旗，抬着要求设立人民法庭审判李承晚、打倒许政“看守内阁”的标语牌，走过东京各主要街道。
    新华社平壤25日电　汉城消息：在美国—许政集团军警严密戒备下的汉城市，今天又爆发了示威斗争。市民六十多人在伪“国会”门前示威，要求立即解散伪“国会”。
    据报道，示威者在上午十时十五分，来到伪“国会议事堂”前。他们拿着的标语牌上写着“反动国会议员滚蛋！”等口号。傀儡当局派来宪兵和警察，用暴力镇压示威，并逮捕示威者。这时，周围的群众愤怒地高呼“连我们一起抓去吧！”表示声援示威的人们。
    示威者在群众的鼓舞下，又冲到李承晚的自由党议员在举行“议员大会”的一个旅馆里，他们冲开大门，一直冲进了会议室。
    据新华社平壤25日电　汉城消息：南朝鲜工人反对法西斯统治和残酷的剥削制度的斗争正日益扩大。据南朝鲜同和通讯社报道，汉城市的六百二十辆公共汽车、三千二百多辆出租汽车的三千八百多名司机和职工，24日举行紧急大会，决定从25日开始支援汉城—新村线的公共汽车职工要求实行八小时劳动制的斗争。他们在一项决议中宣布，如果他们的要求不能达到，将从27日开始“进入总罢工”。汉城—新村线路上的公共汽车职工为了改善劳动条件和要求八小时工作制，从22日开始，每到下午两点就拒绝上工。
    据报道，被工人们的斗争吓慌了的南朝鲜伪“交通部长官”向决定罢工的工人们进行威胁，说什么如果“发生非常事件”，将采取所谓“法律措施”。
