Short Commentary

    A new upsurge of production to seize high yields of coal and steel is vigorously unfolding in various places. A new institution adapted to the new upsurge and the new situation has also emerged, which is the joint office established by the three ministries of Coal, Metallurgy, and Railways to ensure the transportation and supply of raw materials and fuel needed for steel production.
    In the first quarter, railway transportation achieved great results, but the coal transportation plan was not completed well enough. There are many reasons: on the coal mine side, because the capacity of short-distance handling and coal loading equipment in the mine is insufficient, coal often cannot be loaded onto trains; on the railway side, there are also phenomena of not sending trains to some coal mines according to plan. In addition, there is a lack of such a strong joint office in the organizational structure, so some problems cannot be resolved quickly and in a timely manner. Now, establishing a joint office from top to bottom is a major improvement in organization.
    This institution undertakes an important and arduous task. It not only has to check and deal with some problems in the process of coal, ore, and pig iron transportation every day, but also directly supervises various mutually agreed-upon enterprises to strictly follow the agreement. This will vigorously promote the transportation sector to fully exert its transportation effectiveness, and vigorously promote the production sector to tap production potential. Fuxin Mine had such experience: before 1958, there were many instances of arguing between the Fuxin coal production department and the railway transportation department. Since 1958, the Fuxin Municipal Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party studied this situation and merged the original Transportation Department and the train section of the Fuxin Mining Bureau with the Xifuxin Station, which was responsible for freight on the railway side, into a new station, working together under dual leadership, breaking more than 800 old rules and regulations, and establishing more than 700 new rules and regulations. The railway and the mine became one family, and the transportation efficiency increased exponentially. The phenomenon of arguing with each other was swept away from then on. Now, although the joint offices established in various places are not exactly the same as the practice in Fuxin, the institution itself must undertake the task of a promoter.
    Of course, whether an institution can be competent for the work of a promoter, the fundamental problem lies in whether it has a clear ideology and a clear program. Under the guideline of "taking steel as the key link" in industry, what is the program for railway transportation? That is to resolutely implement the transportation guideline of "taking coal as the key link," ensure the over-fulfillment of the coal transportation plan, and ensure the need for raw materials and fuel for coal and steel production. Coal transportation accounts for 40% of the total railway transportation volume in the country. If coal transportation cannot complete the plan well, it will inevitably constrain the completion of other plans. Therefore, only by first becoming a promoter ideologically can the organizational promoter's task be more than competent.
    We are pleased to see some measures taken by the three ministries of Coal, Metallurgy, and Railways to strengthen cooperation, improve transportation, and fully protect steel production. We wish their office will always be a promoting institution.

### 促进的机构

    促进的机构
    一个夺取煤炭、钢铁高产的生产新高潮正在各地蓬勃掀起。一个适应新高潮、新形势的新机构也应运而生，这就是煤炭、冶金、铁道三个部为确保钢铁生产所需要的原料和燃料的运输供应而成立的联合办公机构。
    在第一季度里，铁路运输的成绩很大，但，煤炭的运输计划是完成得不够好的。原因很多：煤矿方面，因为矿内的短途搬运和贮煤装车的设备能力不够，有煤常常装不上车；铁路方面，对有些煤矿也有不能按计划送车的现象。另外，在组织机构上还缺乏这样一个强有力的联合办公机构，以致有些问题不能迅速及时地解决。现在，从上到下建立联合办公机构，这是组织上的一大改进。
    这个机构担负着重要而又艰巨的任务，它不仅每天要检查和处理有关煤炭、矿石、生铁运输过程中的一些问题，而且要直接监督各个互有协定的企业单位严格地按协定办事。这样就会有力地促进运输部门充分地发挥运输效能，有力地促进生产部门挖掘生产潜力。阜新矿就有过这样的经验：阜新煤炭生产部门和铁路运输部门在1958年以前双方扯皮现象很多，从1958年起，中共阜新市委研究这个情况，把原来的阜新矿务局运输部车务段与铁路方面负责货运的西阜新车站合并为新车站，一起办公，双重领导，破除了八百多条旧的规章制度，立了七百多条新的规章制度。路矿两家变成了路矿一家，运输效率成倍增长。那种互相扯皮的现象，从此一扫而光。现在，各地建立的联合办公机构，虽然同阜新的做法不完全相同，然而这个机构的本身必须承担起促进派的任务。
    当然，一个机构能不能胜任促进派的工作，根本问题在于有没有明确的思想和鲜明的纲领。工业在“以钢为纲”的方针下，铁路运输的纲领是什么？那就是坚决执行“以煤为纲”的运输方针，保证煤炭运输计划的超额完成，保证煤炭、钢铁生产对原料燃料的需要。在全国铁路运输量中煤炭运输占有40％的比重，如果煤炭运输不能很好地完成计划，就必然要牵制其他计划的完成。所以，只有首先从思想上当了促进派，组织上的促进派的任务才能胜任有余。
    我们高兴地看到煤炭、冶金、铁道三个部加强协作，搞好运输，全力保钢的一些措施。祝他们的办公机构永远做个促进的机构。
