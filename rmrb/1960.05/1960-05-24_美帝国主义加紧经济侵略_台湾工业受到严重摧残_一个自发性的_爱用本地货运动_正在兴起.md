Xinhua News Agency, 23rd dispatch from Taipei: U.S. imperialism is intensifying its economic aggression, causing serious damage to Taiwan's industry and arousing widespread resentment among the Taiwanese people.

    The "United Daily News" of Taipei reported on May 5th that Taiwan's machine manufacturing industry is facing a severe crisis under the massive dumping of American goods. In the past year, 36 machine factories throughout Taiwan Province have closed down due to operational difficulties. Especially in the first half of this year, even more have closed down or suspended operations. Of the original 14 motorcycle manufacturing factories in Taiwan, 12 have closed down one after another under the impact of American imports. Of the remaining two, one is "Meihua Machinery Factory," which has switched to manufacturing cultivators; the other is "Taiwan Machinery Industry Company," which is in a state of semi-suspension.

    The "United Daily News" said that according to a survey by the "Taiwan District Machinery Industry Association," more than 40 factories that joined the association withdrew their membership in the past year. The reasons for the withdrawal of 36 of them were closures, one changed industry, one subleased, and eight resold, which fully demonstrates the difficulties faced by Taiwan's machine industry under the severe impact of American dumping.

    According to a report in the "New Life Daily" of Taipei, some machinery manufacturing factories in Taiwan that have not yet closed down are also in a "precarious situation." For example, after "Meihua Machinery Factory" switched from manufacturing motorcycles to manufacturing cultivators, American merchants shipped the same type of cultivator to Taiwan for dumping at low prices, causing "Meihua Machinery Factory's" products to be unsalable, resulting in heavy debts and struggling in a very difficult situation.

    While Taiwan's machinery manufacturing factories are rapidly closing down, 31 of Taiwan's 116 soap factories have recently closed down due to the massive dumping of soap and flour from the United States, and the remaining 85 are mostly in a state of semi-suspension. According to a survey by the "Taiwan Flour Industry Association," under the attack of American dumping, Taiwan's flour mills operate for less than ten days a month on average, and every factory is "sighing bitterly." Taiwan's canned food factories, as well as textile, paper, pesticide, and glass factories, are also in dire straits under the squeezing and striking of American goods.

    Taiwanese newspapers say that American aggressors are using so-called "special preferential conditions" such as exemption from import duties to ship various commodities to Taiwan for dumping. After Taiwan's local industry has been severely hit, American capital is now promoting new economic aggression activities in Taiwan, that is, American monopoly capital is preparing to conduct so-called "private investment" in Taiwan, using Taiwan's resources and cheap labor to produce commodities for sale to Taiwan and Southeast Asia to seek exorbitant profits. According to recent news published in various Taiwanese newspapers, American companies planning to "invest" and establish factories in Taiwan include: American Hawaiian Pineapple Company preparing to establish a factory to monopolize Taiwan's canned pineapple industry, American Henry J. Kaiser Company preparing to establish a factory to monopolize Taiwan's steel industry, American Cyanamid Company preparing to establish a factory to monopolize Taiwan's pharmaceutical industry, and American Procter & Gamble Company, American Olin Mathieson Chemical Corporation, American Champion Paper Company, American Stevens Shipping Company, and others are also preparing to "invest" and open factories in Taiwan. According to an article published in "Taiwan Economic Monthly," the U.S. International Cooperation Administration, in order to allow American monopoly capital to plunder arbitrarily in Taiwan, recently submitted a note to the Chiang Kai-shek Group, requesting that Americans be allowed to acquire land in Taiwan and that the Chiang Kai-shek Group not be allowed to prohibit it. According to a report in the "United Daily News" of Taipei on May 18, the U.S. International Cooperation Administration has sent so-called "investment law authority" Littel to Taiwan to be responsible for coercing the Chiang Kai-shek Group to modify various "laws and regulations" to make it more convenient for the United States to carry out crazy economic plunder.

    The American aggressors' rampant economic aggression, sucking the blood and sweat of the Taiwanese people in Taiwan, has aroused widespread anger among the Taiwanese people. Taiwanese newspapers say that a spontaneous "Love Local Goods Movement" is rising in various parts of Taiwan, and many workers, farmers, and students are participating in practical actions. The content of this movement is to refuse to buy American goods and purchase products from local factories in Taiwan. The massive dumping of American goods in Taiwan and the "investment and establishment of factories" by Americans in Taiwan have long been opposed by people in Taiwan's industrial circles. Recently, American Stevenson Shipping Company announced an investment of 1.2 million U.S. dollars to open a textile factory in Taiwan, which aroused a wave of protests from people in Taiwan's textile industry and received the support of people in other industrial circles in Taiwan. Taiwanese newspapers say that the Taiwanese people are very resentful of the Chiang Kai-shek Group's traitorous act of opening the door to the enemy by allowing the United States to dump goods in Taiwan and "invest and establish factories" under "special preferential conditions."

### 美帝国主义加紧经济侵略  台湾工业受到严重摧残  一个自发性的“爱用本地货运动”正在兴起

    美帝国主义加紧经济侵略
    台湾工业受到严重摧残
    一个自发性的“爱用本地货运动”正在兴起
    新华社23日电　台北消息：美帝国主义加紧进行经济侵略，使台湾的工业受到了严重的摧残，激起了台湾人民普遍的愤慨。
    台北市“联合报”在5月5日发表消息说：台湾机器制造工业在美国货大量倾销下，现在已面临严重的危机。过去一年内台湾全省有三十六家机器工厂因经营困难而倒闭。特别是今年上半年这几个月，倒闭停业者更多。台湾原有十四家制造摩托车的工厂，在美国货进口的打击下，先后倒闭了十二家，仅余的两家，一家是“美化机械厂”，已转业制造耕耘机；另一家是“台湾机械工业公司”，则陷于半停工状态。
    “联合报”说，根据“台湾区机器工业同业公会”的调查，加入这个同业公会的工厂，在过去一年中有四十多家退出会籍，其中三十六家退出的原因是倒闭，一家改业，一家转租，八家转售，这充分表现台湾机器工业在美国货倾销的严重打击下经营的困难。
    另据台北市“新生报”报道，台湾目前还没有倒闭的一些机械制造工厂，也都在“风雨飘摇朝不保夕之中”。如“美化机械厂”由制造摩托车转业制造耕耘机后，又被美国商人把同一类型的耕耘机运到台湾贱价倾销，使“美化机械厂”的产品滞销，因而负债累累，正在很困难的状况下挣扎。
    与台湾机械制造业工厂猛烈倒闭的同时，由于美国向台湾大量倾销肥皂和面粉，台湾一百一十六家肥皂工厂最近倒闭了三十一家，剩下的八十五家也大部分陷于半停工状态。据“台湾面粉工业同业公会”的调查，在美国货倾销的袭击下，台湾各面粉厂平均每月开工不到十天，家家工厂都在“大叹苦经”。台湾的罐头食品工厂和纺织、造纸、农药、玻璃等工厂，在美国货的排挤打击下，也都岌岌可危。
    台湾报纸说，美国侵略者利用免缴进口税等所谓“特别优惠条件”，把各种商品运入台湾倾销，使台湾本地的工业大受打击以后，现在美国资本又在台湾推行新的经济侵略活动，那就是美国垄断资本纷纷准备到台湾进行所谓
  “私人投资”，利用台湾的资源和廉价劳动力生产商品，向台湾和东南亚各地推销，牟取暴利。据最近台湾各报发表的消息，打算到台湾“投资”设立工厂的美国企业，计有美国夏威夷菠萝公司准备设厂垄断台湾的罐头菠萝业，美国亨利·凯塞公司准备设厂独占台湾的钢铁工业，美国氰氨公司准备设厂垄断台湾的制药工业，美国普罗忒甘贝尔公司、美国奥林·马锡森化学公司、美国香槟纸业公司、美国史蒂文斯轮船公司等，也纷纷筹备在台湾“投资”开设工厂。据“台湾经济月刊”发表的文章透露，美国国际合作署为了使美国垄断资本在台湾恣意掠夺，最近竟向蒋介石集团提出照会，要求容许美国人在台湾可以取得土地，蒋介石集团不得禁止。据5月18日台北市“联合报”消息，美国国际合作署已派遣所谓“投资法权威”里特尔前去台湾，负责胁迫蒋介石集团把各种“法规”修改得更加便利美国进行疯狂的经济掠夺。
    美国侵略者在台湾猖狂地进行吸吮台湾人民血汗的经济侵略勾当，已经激起了台湾人民普遍的愤怒。台湾报纸说，一个自发性的“爱用本地货运动”正在台湾各地兴起，许多工人、农民、学生都用实际行动参加了，这个运动的内容就是拒绝购买美国货，而购用台湾本地工厂的产品。对于美国商品大量向台湾倾销和美国人向台湾“投资设厂”，长期以来都受到台湾工业界人士的反对。最近美国史蒂文森轮船公司宣布以一百二十万美元投资在台湾开设一家纺织厂，这激起了台湾纺织工业界人士抗议的浪潮，并且得到了台湾其他工业界人士的声援。台湾报纸说，台湾人民对蒋介石集团允许美国以“特别优惠条件”向台湾倾销商品和“投资设厂”这种开门揖盗的卖国勾当，十分痛恨。
