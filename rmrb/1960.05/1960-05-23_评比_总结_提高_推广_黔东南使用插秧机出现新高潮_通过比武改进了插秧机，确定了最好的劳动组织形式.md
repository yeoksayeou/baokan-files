    A New Upsurge in the Use of Rice Transplanters in Qiandongnan, Guizhou
    Through Competitions, Rice Transplanters Have Been Improved, and the Best Form of Labor Organization Has Been Determined
    (Our dispatch) The CPC Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture Committee of Guizhou Province convened a prefecture-wide rice transplanter competition in Rongjiang County from May 5th to 8th. This grand competition summarized a set of experiences in using rice transplanters.
  Adapting Rice Transplanters to Various Conditions
    This year, the rice seedlings were cultivated well, and the seedlings were already more than a foot tall during the transplanting competition. Some transplanting operators cut off a section of both the roots and tips of the seedlings before transplanting; others drained deep-water fields before transplanting. At this time, the Prefecture Agricultural Implement Research Institute imitated and manufactured a Shanghai "Nanhui No. 1" rice transplanter, and Liping County manufactured a "Qiandongnan No. 1" rice transplanter, which did not require cutting off the roots and tips of the seedlings, and could transplant quickly and well regardless of water depth.
  This competition solved a fundamental problem: it's not that the rice transplanter is not adapted to the environment, but that people's subjective efforts are not enough. Based on the experience of the Prefecture Agricultural Implement Research Institute and Liping County in modifying rice transplanters, the workers from various counties participating in the competition who manufactured rice transplanters modified high-seedling frame rice transplanters overnight. In the third competition on May 7th, the modified rice transplanters from Zhenyuan, Rongjiang, and other counties were put into use, and they could transplant quickly and well regardless of water depth, long seedlings, or short seedlings.
  Which Form of Labor Organization is Better?
    To win the battle of rice transplanting and pass the test of using and ensuring the quality of rice transplanters, it is very important to rationally organize labor. At this rice transplanter competition, the Qiandongnan Prefecture Committee compared the four labor organization forms currently in use and summarized advanced experience in this regard.
    The four forms of labor organization are: First, one rice transplanter operator per rice transplanter, self-pulling, self-loading, self-transplanting, and self-repairing. This lone wolf approach is inefficient, with seedling pulling taking up 77% of the time, so only seven or eight fen of land can be transplanted in a day. Second, rice transplanter operators specialize in transplanting, regardless of seedling pulling, which can give full play to the role of rice transplanter operators and rice transplanters; however, the division of labor is not clear, and each process cannot be closely linked, often because one link lags behind, affecting the entire group. Third, small groups are temporarily formed with the rice transplanter operator as the core, generally three to five people. Its advantages are: the machine transplanting group is the combat unit, with division of labor and cooperation; the disadvantage is that the temporarily formed group cannot cooperate smoothly. Fourth, machine transplanting groups are formed with three to five people, the members are fixed, there are strong leading backbones, the internal cooperation is very effective, and joint operations make the group a strong combat unit. The competition affirmed that this is a better form of organization.
  Transplanting Quality Can Be Fully Guaranteed
    During the previous period of using rice transplanters for transplanting, some of the transplanted seedlings did not meet the quality requirements. The main reason is that some people seek speed over quality. For example: in the first competition, everyone transplanted very quickly, but most did not meet the specifications; in the second competition, the transplanting was slightly slower, and most met the specifications; in the third competition, more than 90% reached the quality requirements, and the transplanting speed was not slow either.
    Layer-by-Layer Competitions Accelerate Promotion
    The Qiandongnan Prefecture Committee believes that the rice transplanter competition has the following three major benefits:
    First, it can discover and solve problems in a timely manner.
    Second, it can promote mutual learning and common improvement.
    Third, through the competition, it strengthens the confidence and determination of the broad masses to use rice transplanters. Therefore, the Qiandongnan Prefecture Committee decided that all counties, communes, and management districts should hold rice transplanter competitions separately to push the mass movement of using rice transplanters to a new upsurge.

    黔东南使用插秧机出现新高潮
    通过比武改进了插秧机，确定了最好的劳动组织形式
    本报讯　中共贵州黔东南苗族侗族自治州州委于5月5日至8日在榕江县召开了全州插秧机比武大会。这次大比武，总结出一套使用插秧机的经验。
  要插秧机适应各种条件
    今年秧苗培育得好，比武插秧时秧株已有一尺多高。部分插秧手把秧根、秧尖各剪去一节，然后再插；有的遇到深水田，就先放水后插秧。这时州农具研究所仿造出一部上海“南汇一号”插秧机，与黎平县制造的一部“黔东南一号”插秧机，却不需要剪去秧根秧尖，也不管水深水浅，一样插得快、插得好。
  这次比武大会，解决了一个根本问题：不是插秧机不适应环境，而是人的主观努力不够。根据州农具研究所和黎平县改装插秧机的经验，各县参加比武的制造插秧机的工人，连夜改装高秧架插秧机。5月7日第三次比武，镇远、榕江等县改装过的插秧机上阵，不管水深、水浅，长秧、短秧，一样插得快、插得好。
  哪种劳动组织形式好？
    要打好插秧这一仗，过好插秧机的使用关和质量关，合理地组织劳力很重要。在这次插秧机比武大会上，黔东南州委对目前运用的四种劳动组织形式作了比较，总结出这方面的先进经验。
    这四种劳动组织形式是：一、插秧机手一人一部插秧机，自扯、自装、自插、自补。这种单枪匹马的方式，效率不高，扯秧要花去77％的时间，因此一天只能插七八分地。二、插秧机手专门插秧，不管扯秧，这能充分发挥插秧机手和插秧机的作用；但分工不明确，各道工序不能环环扣紧，往往因为一环落后，影响全组。三，以插秧机手为核心，临时编成小组，一般三至五人。它的优点是：以机插小组为战斗单位，人员有分工，有协作；缺点是临时编成的小组，协作不能得手应心。四，以三至五人组成机插小组，成员固定，有坚强的领导骨干，组内配合十分有力，联合作战，使小组成为坚强的战斗单位。比武大会肯定这是一种较好的组织形式。
  插秧质量完全能够保证
    前一段时间使用插秧机插秧，有一部分秧插得不符合质量要求。主要原因是有些人求快不求好。例如：第一次比武，大家插得很快，但大都不符合规格；第二次比武插得稍慢，大部分符合规格；第三次比武，就有90％以上的达到了质量要求，而且插秧速度也不慢。
    层层比武加速推广
    黔东南州委认为插秧机大比武有以下三大好处：
    第一，能及时地发现问题解决问题。
    第二，可以互相学习、共同提高。
    第三，通过大比武，坚定了广大群众使用插秧机的信心和决心。因此，黔东南州委决定所有的县、社、管理区，都要分别举行插秧机大比武，把使用插秧机的群众运动推向新高潮。
