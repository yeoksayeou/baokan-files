Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 9th: Choi Yong-kun, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, said here tonight that with the support and solidarity of the people of fraternal socialist countries and all peace-loving people around the world, the Korean people are determined to drive the American aggressors out of South Korea and complete the great cause of peaceful reunification of the fatherland.

He made these remarks at a banquet held by Czechoslovak Ambassador Stanislav to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the liberation of Czechoslovakia. Korean party and government leaders headed by Kim Il-sung attended tonight's banquet.

Choi Yong-kun also said that today the U.S. imperialist policy of aggression against Korea has suffered a heavy blow in the face of the people of the world. The heroic struggle of the South Korean people against the fascist rule of the U.S. and the Syngman Rhee clique and for freedom and democratic rights has led to the collapse of the Syngman Rhee puppet regime. This is the first great victory won by the South Korean people in their struggle.

Choi Yong-kun said: The struggle of the South Korean people shows that the U.S. imperialists cannot maintain their colonial rule even with tanks and guns, and that the people are invincible. He said that, however, the U.S. imperialists have not learned a lesson from this, and they have brought out new puppets to maintain their fascist colonial rule and further suppress the people's struggle.

He emphasized: No suppression can stop the struggle of the South Korean people, and no conspiracy can deceive them. The South Korean people will never allow the corrupt ruling structure to be preserved, and the newly appointed puppets will inevitably suffer the same fate as Syngman Rhee.

He said: The South Korean people are waging a tenacious struggle to completely abolish the U.S. imperialist colonial ruling structure. The United States must withdraw its troops from South Korea and is not allowed to interfere in Korea's internal affairs.

Choi Yong-kun said that in South Korea, freedom of activity for all political parties and social organizations and the democratic rights of the people must be guaranteed. In order for the Korean people to peacefully resolve the Korean issue themselves, representatives of the North and South Korean people should gather together.

He emphasized: The people of the northern part of the Republic warmly support and sympathize with the heroic struggle of the South Korean people against the U.S. imperialist colonial rule.

Zheng Yilong, Vice Premier of the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, also stated in his report at the Pyongyang rally yesterday celebrating the 15th anniversary of the great Soviet Army's liberation of Czechoslovakia: In order to rescue the South Korean people from the miserable living hell, first of all, the U.S. imperialists must withdraw from South Korea.

Zheng Yilong said that all fascist ruling machines and criminal laws manufactured by the U.S. imperialists in South Korea must be abolished, and freedom of activity for democratic political parties and social organizations in South Korea, as well as the democratic rights and freedoms of the people, must be guaranteed. The artificial obstacles created by the U.S. imperialists between the North and South of Korea must be removed, and a joint conference of representatives of political parties and social organizations in North and South Korea should be convened as soon as possible to discuss national affairs. He said that the Korean issue must be resolved peacefully by the Korean people themselves without foreign interference, and our people have every right to do so.

Zheng Yilong said that all the Korean people, under the correct leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic government headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, will launch a more resolute struggle to force the U.S. troops to withdraw from South Korea and accelerate the peaceful reunification of the fatherland.

    崔庸健在捷驻朝大使宴会上说
    朝鲜人民一定要和平统一祖国
    郑一龙指出必须坚决迫使美军撤出南朝鲜
    据新华社平壤9日电　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会委员长崔庸健今天晚上在这里说，受到兄弟般的社会主义阵营各国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的支持和声援的朝鲜人民，一定要把美国侵略军从南朝鲜赶出去，完成和平统一祖国的伟大事业。
    他是在捷克斯洛伐克大使斯坦尼斯拉夫举行的庆祝捷克斯洛伐克解放十五周年的宴会上说这番话的。以金日成为首的朝鲜党政领导人出席了今晚的宴会。
    崔庸健还说，今天美帝国主义对朝鲜的侵略政策，在全世界人民的面前遭到了沉重的打击。南朝鲜人民反对美国、李承晚集团的法西斯统治、争取自由和民主权利的英勇斗争，使李承晚傀儡政权垮台了。这是南朝鲜人民在斗争中取得的第一个巨大的胜利。
    崔庸健说：南朝鲜人民的斗争说明，美帝国主义者用坦克和枪炮也不能维持它的殖民统治，人民是不可征服的。他说，但是，美帝国主义者并没有从这里得到教训，它搬出了新的傀儡，来维持它的法西斯殖民统治，进一步镇压人民的斗争。
    他强调说：任何镇压也挡不住南朝鲜人民的斗争，任何的阴谋手段也欺骗不了南朝鲜人民。南朝鲜人民决不容许把腐败的统治机构保存下来，新上台的傀儡将不可避免地要遭到像李承晚一样的命运。
    他说：南朝鲜人民正为完全废除美帝国主义殖民统治机构而进行顽强的斗争，美国必须把它的军队从南朝鲜撤走，并且不许干涉朝鲜的内政。
    崔庸健说，在南朝鲜，必须保证一切政党和社会团体活动的自由和人民的民主权利。为了由朝鲜人民自己和平解决朝鲜问题，南北朝鲜人民的代表应该聚于一堂。
    他强调说：共和国北部人民热烈支持和声援南朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义殖民统治的英勇的斗争。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁副首相郑一龙在昨天平壤市庆祝伟大的苏军解放捷克斯洛伐克十五周年的大会上作报告时也讲到：为了把南朝鲜人民从悲惨的活地狱中拯救出来，首先，美帝国主义者必须撤出南朝鲜。
    郑一龙说，必须废除由美帝国主义者在南朝鲜一手制造的一切法西斯统治机器和罪恶的法律，保障南朝鲜民主政党和社会团体的活动的自由以及人民的民主权利和自由。必须清除美帝国主义者制造的朝鲜南北部之间的人为障碍，早日召开南北朝鲜各政党和社会团体代表联席会议，商谈国家大事。他说，朝鲜问题必须在不受外国干涉的情况下由朝鲜人民自己和平解决，我国人民完全有权利这样做。
    郑一龙说，全体朝鲜人民在以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府的正确领导下，将展开更坚决的斗争，以迫使美国军队撤出南朝鲜，加速祖国的和平统一。
