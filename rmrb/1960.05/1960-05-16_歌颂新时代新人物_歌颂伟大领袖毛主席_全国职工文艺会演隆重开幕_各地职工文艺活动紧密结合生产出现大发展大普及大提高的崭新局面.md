Xinhua News Agency, 14th dispatch: The National Workers' Literary and Art Performance grandly opened today at the Great Hall of the People in the capital. More than 2,700 worker literary and art representatives from twenty-eight provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country gathered together. They will showcase their talents and perform many rich and colorful literary and art programs, vividly demonstrating the soaring enthusiasm and communist spirit of China's working class in the cause of socialist construction, and singing the praises of the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, and singing the praises of the great leader Chairman Mao.

The nearly six hundred programs participating in this performance were selected from literary and art performances in various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions. They include various forms such as music, dance, folk art, acrobatics, drama, opera, and song and dance drama, with extremely wide-ranging themes. In addition to a large number of programs reflecting current real life, there are also revolutionary historical themes and some national and folk traditional programs. The performers come from all aspects of the industrial front, including more than twenty ethnic groups, of which one-third are advanced producers.

Liu Ningyi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, delivered a speech at today's opening ceremony, warmly congratulating the opening of the Workers' Literary and Art Performance. He said: This unprecedented National Workers' Literary and Art Performance is a general review of the achievements of workers' cultural activities since the Great Leap Forward. It demonstrates the great victory of the Party's literary and art policy and Chairman Mao's literary and art thought, and expresses the heroic spirit of the broad masses of workers in our country holding high the three red banners and advancing victoriously, and their firm belief in forever following the Party and forever following Chairman Mao. Liu Ningyi said that under the glorious illumination of the Party's General Line for socialist construction, with the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, worker creation is unprecedentedly flourishing, and a situation of great popularization and great improvement has emerged. The masses of workers use their own works to record the heroic deeds created by the Chinese working class in the great Mao Zedong era, demonstrating the pioneering spirit of the workers in production and in art, and playing a due role in promoting the Great Leap Forward in production. Liu Ningyi said that the current excellent situation of sustained Great Leap Forward requires workers' cultural activities to more closely cooperate with the current political and production movements, widely and deeply publicize the advanced ideas of the working class, and become a powerful weapon for promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology. He said that through this performance, we will further study and implement Chairman Mao's literary and art thought, so that workers' literary and art activities can keep up with the needs of the rapid development of socialist construction, and promote workers' cultural and artistic activities to a new stage.

Qian Junrui, Vice Minister of Culture, Yang Haibo, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, Li Dequan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, and Yang Hansheng, Secretary-General of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, also spoke at the meeting. They represented all walks of life in warmly congratulating the success of this performance, praising the great achievements of workers' literary and art activities, and encouraging worker literary and art activists to step up their learning, work hard to improve, and make more and greater contributions to socialist and communist literature and art. Chen Suzhi, an advanced producer from Beijing and a representative of the performers, thanked the Party for its care and encouragement in her speech, and expressed her determination to be a skilled hand in production and a red propagandist.

Finally, the Beijing delegation performed excellent programs. The large chorus jointly performed by more than 400 representatives of advanced collectives and advanced producers was warmly welcomed by the audience.

This National Workers' Literary and Art Performance is jointly sponsored by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Ministry of Culture, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, the All-China Women's Federation, and the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles.

Xinhua News Agency, 14th dispatch: Encouraged and promoted by the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production in our country, in the past two years, national workers' amateur literary and art activities have more closely served politics and production, and a new situation of great development, great popularization, and great improvement has emerged.

At present, worker amateur literary and art organizations have spread throughout factories and enterprises in various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country. Many factory workshops, work sections, and even production teams have established their own literary and art positions for workers. In 1959 alone, according to incomplete statistics, the number of worker amateur literary and art organizations in the country had developed to more than 180,000, with more than 2.9 million workers regularly participating in activities, an increase of more than five times compared to 1957.

In the past two years, under the leadership of Party organizations at all levels, workers' literary and art activities in various places have adhered to putting politics in command, closely cooperating with production, and constantly improving the quality of creation, producing a large number of excellent works and good programs, and using various methods to carry out publicity activities. According to incomplete statistics in Shaanxi Province, workers have created more than 8 million literary and artistic works in the past two years. Workers in Taiyuan City have created more than 2,300 literary and artistic works that have been published in newspapers and magazines at all levels. In the recent Workers' Literary and Art Performance in Shandong Province, programs reflecting current technological innovation and technological revolution accounted for more than one-third. More than 500 worker literary and art activists in eighteen cities including Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, Harbin, and Guangzhou have been admitted as members of literary and art workers associations such as the Writers Association and the Artists Association due to their outstanding achievements in literary and artistic creation.

The vigorous and healthy development of national workers' amateur literary and art activities is due to the strong leadership of Party committees at all levels. Under the leadership and care of Party committees in various places, in the past two years, a large number of advanced producers and Party and League members have participated in the worker literary and art ranks. They have diligently studied and worked hard to become "pacesetters in production and singers of the Great Leap Forward." A group of "five-good activists" with "good ideology, good production, good study, good ties with the masses, and good cultural activities" has emerged in the worker literary and art ranks in various places.

    全国职工文艺会演隆重开幕
    各地职工文艺活动紧密结合生产出现大发展大普及大提高的崭新局面
    新华社14日讯　全国职工文艺会演今天在首都人民大会堂隆重开幕。来自全国二十八个省、市、自治区的二千七百多位职工文艺代表欢聚一堂，他们将大显身手，演出许多丰富多彩的文艺节目，生动地表现出我国工人阶级在社会主义建设事业中的冲天干劲和共产主义的风格，歌颂党的总路线、大跃进、人民公社，歌颂伟大领袖毛主席。
    参加这次会演的近六百个节目是在各省、市、自治区的文艺会演中层层选拔出来的，有音乐、舞蹈、曲艺、杂技、话剧、戏曲、歌剧等多种形式，题材极为广泛，除大量反映当前现实生活的节目外，还有革命历史题材和一部分民族、民间的传统节目。演员来自工业战线的各个方面包括二十多个民族，其中有三分之一是先进生产者。
    中华全国总工会主席刘宁一在今天的开幕式上致词热烈祝贺职工文艺会演的开幕。他说：这次规模空前的全国职工文艺会演，是大跃进以来职工文化活动成就的总检阅，显示了党的文艺方针和毛主席文艺思想的伟大胜利，表达出我国广大工人群众高举三面红旗乘胜前进的英雄气概和永远跟着党走、永远跟着毛主席走的坚强信念。刘宁一说，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，随着工农业生产的大跃进，职工创作空前繁荣，出现了大普及、大提高的局面。职工群众用自己的作品，记录了我国工人阶级在伟大毛泽东时代创造的英雄事迹，显示了工人群众在生产上、在艺术上的首创精神，对促进生产大跃进起了应有的作用。刘宁一说，目前我们所处的持续大跃进的大好形势，要求职工文化活动更加紧密地配合当前政治运动和生产运动，广泛深入地宣传工人阶级先进思想，成为兴无灭资的有力武器。他说，通过这次会演将进一步学习和贯彻毛主席的文艺思想，使职工文艺活动跟上社会主义建设事业迅速发展的需要，把职工文化艺术活动推进到一个新的阶段。
    文化部副部长钱俊瑞、共青团中央书记处书记杨海波、全国妇联副主席李德全、全国文联秘书长阳翰笙都在会上讲了话，他们代表各界热烈祝贺这次会演的成功，赞颂职工文艺活动的巨大成就，并鼓励工人文艺积极分子加紧学习、努力提高，为社会主义和共产主义文学艺术做出更多更大的贡献。演员代表、北京市先进生产者陈素芝在讲话中，感谢党的关怀和鼓励，表示决心做好生产上的能手和红色的宣传员。
    最后由北京市代表团演了精采节目。由先进集体代表和先进生产者四百多人联合表演的大合唱，受到观众的热烈欢迎。
    这次全国职工文艺会演是由全国总工会、文化部、共青团中央、全国妇联、全国文联联合举办的。
    据新华社14日讯　在我国工农业生产大跃进的鼓舞和推动下，两年来全国职工业余文艺活动，更紧密地为政治和生产服务，出现了大发展、大普及、大提高的崭新局面。
    目前职工业余文艺组织已遍及全国各省市、自治区的工厂企业，许多工厂的车间、工段以至生产小组都建立了工人自己的文艺阵地。仅1959年不完全的统计，全国职工业余文艺组织就已发展到十八万多个，经常参加活动的职工有二百九十多万人，比1957年增加了五倍多。
    两年来各地职工文艺活动在各级党的组织领导下，坚持政治挂帅，紧密配合生产，不断提高创作质量，产生了大量优秀作品和好节目，并运用多种方式进行宣传活动。据陕西省不完全统计，两年来职工创作的文艺作品达八百多万件。太原市职工创作的文艺作品有二千三百多篇在各级报刊杂志上发表。山东省最近举行的职工文艺会演中，表现当前技术革新和技术革命的节目占三分之一以上。上海、北京、天津、哈尔滨、广州等十八个城市，有五百多名职工文艺积极分子，由于在文艺创作方面有突出成就而被吸收成为作协、美协等文艺工作者协会的会员。
    全国职工业余文艺活动获得蓬勃健康的发展，是由于各级党委的坚强领导。在各地党委的领导和关怀下，两年来各地有大批先进生产者和党、团员参加职工文艺队伍，他们勤学苦练成为“生产上的标兵、大跃进的歌手”。在各地的职工文艺队伍中都涌现出一批“思想好、生产好、学习好、联系群众好、文化活动好”的五好积极分子。
