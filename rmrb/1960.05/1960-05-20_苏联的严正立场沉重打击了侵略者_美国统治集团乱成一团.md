Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 19th: The U.S. political circles and the bourgeois press are still in a state of panic, loss, and confusion as the U.S.'s aggressive face has been greatly exposed and its aggressive policies have been severely hit.

More and more newspapers and members of Congress have publicly criticized the government's policies. At the same time, some influential politicians have been trying to absolve the Eisenhower government of its guilt, attempting to shift the responsibility for sabotaging the Four-Power Summit to the Soviet Union.

Congressman Meyer published an article in "The Nation" magazine, criticizing the U.S. government's provocation against the Soviet Union as playing "war brinkmanship." He believes that the U.S. sending planes to invade Soviet airspace and conduct espionage activities is a "stupid act" and "unjustified."

"The New York Post" has recently published many articles and commentaries criticizing the U.S. government. The newspaper's Paris correspondent, Childs, wrote that "Eisenhower's words of sincerity (towards the Soviet Union) seem to be completely contrary to his policies." Another "New York Post" reporter, Barry, said that Washington had "made a series of incredible blunders" in the U-2 spy plane incident. Barry said that, in the eyes of fair observers (including those in many U.S. allied nations), Khrushchev's demands that the U.S. abandon spy flights, apologize, punish those responsible for the incident, and guarantee not to repeat it, were all "understandable conditions." Barry also said that Khrushchev had "discredited Eisenhower."

Some influential figures in the ruling clique continue to clamor against the Soviet Union. Vice President Nixon said on the 18th that Eisenhower should not apologize to the Soviet Union for the spy plane incident; rather, Khrushchev should apologize to Eisenhower for his "insulting" speech. Nixon also advocated that the U.S. should "continue to maintain its strength." Republican Senator Bridges openly advocated that the U.S. "should continue" to send spy planes to provoke the Soviet Union, "or take equivalent intelligence measures."

    苏联的严正立场沉重打击了侵略者
    美国统治集团乱成一团
    据新华社19日讯　华盛顿消息：美国政界和资产阶级报纸由于美国侵略面目的大暴露和侵略政策受到沉重打击，继续处于惊惶失措和矛盾混乱的状态。
    越来越多的报纸和国会议员公开对政府的政策提出了指责。同时，一些有势力的政客却百般为艾森豪威尔政府开脱罪责，力图把破坏四国首脑会议的责任推给苏联。
    众议员麦耶在“民族”周刊上发表一篇文章，批评美国政府对苏联挑衅是玩弄“战争边缘”手法。他认为，美国派飞机侵犯苏联领空和进行间谍活动是“愚蠢的行动”，是“没有理由”的。
    “纽约邮报”最近一连发表了许多篇文章和评论，指责美国政府。这家报纸驻巴黎记者蔡尔兹写道，“艾森豪威尔所说的（对苏联）表示诚意的话似乎同他的政策是完全背道而驰的”。“纽约邮报”的另一个记者巴里说，华盛顿在U—2型间谍飞机事件上“犯了一系列难以置信的大错误”。巴里说，在公正的观察家（包括美国许多盟国的观察家）看来，赫鲁晓夫要求美国放弃间谍飞行表示道歉，惩处对这个事件负责的人，并保证不再重犯”这些都是“可以理解的条件”。巴里还说，赫鲁晓夫使“艾森豪威尔威信扫地”。
    统治集团中一些有势力的人继续发出反苏叫嚷。副总统尼克松18日居然说，现在不应当由艾森豪威尔就间谍飞机事件向苏联道歉，而是应当由赫鲁晓夫就他的“侮辱性”讲话向艾森豪威尔道歉。尼克松同时还鼓吹美国要“继续保持实力”。共和党参议员布里奇斯公开主张美国“应该继续”派间谍飞机向苏联挑衅，“或者采取同等的情报措施”。
