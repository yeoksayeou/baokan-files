    High-Speed Development of Silkworm Cocoon Production

    This year, China has made thorough preparations for silkworm cocoon production. In the major silkworm-producing areas, fertilization, inter-tillage, pest control, pruning of mulberry gardens, and the organization of tussah silkworm farms have been done very well. Silkworm rearing rooms and tools are the basic infrastructure for developing sericulture. This year, the silkworm areas have newly built and renovated about one million silkworm rearing rooms and added more than 36 million silkworm rearing tools, laying a foundation for good spring silkworm rearing and a good harvest.

    Over the past ten years since liberation, China's silk production has made great achievements. In 1959, the total output of silkworm cocoons increased more than threefold compared with the early days of liberation. However, with the high-speed development of the national economy and the continuous improvement of people's lives, the output of silkworm cocoons still cannot meet the needs of all aspects. We must achieve a faster and greater development in silkworm cocoon production.

    Silk production in China has a history of thousands of years. The vast rural areas have long had the habit of raising silkworms, and silk has always been one of China's important rural specialties. Farmers in silkworm areas say, "Silkworm rearing nourishes the fields in the first half of the year, and the fields nourish the people in the second half of the year," which accurately illustrates the close relationship between silkworm rearing and farming. Deqing County, Zhejiang Province, conscientiously implemented the principle of "using grain to promote mulberry and silkworms to supplement grain," and the output of silkworm cocoons increased more than fivefold compared with the early days of liberation. The output value of silkworm cocoons reached more than 25% of the total agricultural income. Grain output has also greatly increased, turning the county from a grain-deficient county into a grain-surplus county, selling a large amount of surplus grain to the state every year. Silkworm droppings are a kind of feed. In many places in Hebei, Shandong, and Jiangsu, silkworm droppings are used to raise pigs, saving feed grain and achieving good silkworms, fat pigs, abundant grain, and lush mulberry trees. Silkworm droppings are also a very good fertilizer. In terms of the nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium contained in silkworm droppings, the silkworm droppings from one silkworm egg sheet are equivalent to about 40 catties of chemical fertilizer. These facts fully illustrate that planting mulberry trees and raising silkworms and planting grain crops can completely support and promote each other. Silk has always been a clothing material loved by the Chinese people and an important export commodity. Silk is also an indispensable raw material for the textile industry, heavy industry, and electrical machinery industry. Farmers in Zhejiang say, "Silkworms and mulberries are full of treasures, and one calculation shows five great advantages," which means that developing sericulture has great benefits for supporting industry, supporting foreign trade, supporting the domestic market, increasing commune income, and improving the lives of commune members.

    The necessity of developing sericulture on a large scale is very obvious. So, can silkworm cocoon production develop at a high speed? There are two different views on this issue. One view is that silkworm cocoon production, like other types of production, can be developed on a large scale and rapidly. The other view is just the opposite, believing that the development of mulberry and tussah production cannot be too fast because mulberry and tussah trees are perennial crops and cannot grow quickly. Mulberry and tussah trees are indeed perennial crops, but if appropriate cultivation management is implemented, the unit yield of mulberry and tussah leaves can be rapidly increased in a relatively short period of time. Jiubao People's Commune, Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province, planted 277 mu of new mulberry gardens in the spring of 1959. Ten months later, the average yield per mu was 882 catties, which is a very fast rate. Less than one-fifth of China's tussah forests are used for raising tussah silkworms. The remaining four-fifths can be used for raising tussah silkworms with slight organization.

    The majority of the country has now begun to raise spring silkworms. Spring silkworms account for a large proportion and the yield is relatively stable. To develop silkworm cocoon production at a high speed, it is first necessary to raise spring silkworms well. This year's planned spring silkworm egg distribution is more than 40% higher than last year. Efforts should be made to distribute and raise enough silkworms to ensure that every silkworm egg hatches and every silkworm spins a cocoon. This spring, mulberry gardens have sufficient fertilizer, long branches, and many buds. The preparation work for silkworm rearing has also started earlier than in any previous year. With these favorable conditions, as long as we continue to work hard, it is entirely possible to strive for a bumper harvest of spring cocoons this year. A bumper harvest of spring cocoons not only completes the majority of the annual production increase task, but also can further encourage people's enthusiasm, promote summer with spring, and lead autumn with summer, to win a comprehensive and high-yield harvest of silkworm cocoon production this year.

    In order to ensure a comprehensive bumper harvest of spring silkworm production this year, all silkworm areas should immediately organize forces to conduct another in-depth inspection of the preparation work for silkworm rearing, and further implement the silkworm rearing plan and the required labor force to the contracted units. In recent years, China's new mulberry gardens have developed rapidly. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the area of newly planted mulberry gardens is approximately twice that of the early days of liberation. We must conscientiously manage all the young mulberry trees well, ensure that every plant survives and every piece becomes a forest, so that they can be put into production as early as possible.

    Silkworm farms are a new product after communization. They are the base for high-speed development of silkworm cocoon production and also the direction for future development of sericulture. People's communes in various places should conscientiously manage the silkworm farms that have been established well, and areas with the conditions should actively establish new silkworm farms, so as to gradually establish a more solid and reliable foundation for China's future silkworm cocoon production.

    The 1960 silkworm cocoon production has already had a good start. It can be predicted that under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line and on the basis of the unparalleled superiority of the people's communes, as long as we strengthen the Party's leadership and launch a large-scale mass movement, a new situation of comprehensive, high-yield, and bumper harvest will surely emerge in this year's silk production.

### 高速度发展蚕茧生产

    高速度发展蚕茧生产
    今年我国蚕茧生产的准备工作很充分。广大蚕区的桑园施肥、中耕、除虫、修枝和柞蚕场的整理工作都做得很好。蚕室、蚕具是发展蚕业生产的基本建设。今年各蚕区新建和修建的蚕室达一百万间左右，新添蚕?近三千六百余万个，为养好春蚕争取丰收打下了基础。
    解放十年来，我国蚕丝生产取得了很大的成绩，1959年蚕茧总产量比解放初期增加了二倍多。但是随着国民经济高速度的发展和人民生活的不断提高，蚕茧产量还不能满足各个方面的需要，我们必须使蚕茧生产有一个更快更大的发展。
    蚕丝生产在我国已经有几千年的历史，广大农村早有养蚕的习惯，蚕丝一直是我国农村的重要特产之一。蚕区农民说：“上半年蚕养田，下半年田养人。”确切地说明了养蚕和种地的密切关系。浙江省德清县认真地实行“以粮带桑，以蚕辅粮”，蚕茧产量比解放初增加五倍多，蚕茧产值达到农业总收入25％以上；粮食产量也大大增加，使这个县由缺粮县变为余粮县，每年都有大量余粮卖给国家。蚕粪是一种饲料，河北、山东、江苏很多地方以蚕粪养猪，节约了饲料粮食，达到蚕好、猪肥、粮多、桑茂。蚕粪还是一种很好的肥料，就蚕粪所含的氮、磷、钾来说，一张蚕种的蚕粪，约相当四十斤化肥。这些事实充分说明：栽桑养蚕和种植粮食作物，完全可以相互支援，相互促进。丝绸从古以来就是我国人民喜爱的衣料，又是我国重要的外销物资。蚕丝还是纺织工业、重工业、电机工业不可缺少的原料。浙江农民说“蚕桑浑身宝，一算五大好”，就是说发展养蚕业对支援工业，支援对外贸易，支援国内市场，增加公社收益，改善社员生活都有很大好处。
    大量发展养蚕事业的必要性，是十分明显的。那么，蚕茧生产能不能高速度发展呢？在这个问题上有两种不同的看法。一种看法是蚕茧生产和别种生产一样，能够大量地、迅速地发展。另一种看法恰恰相反，认为蚕桑生产发展速度不能太快，理由是桑、柞树都是多年生作物，不能很快长起来。桑、柞树确是多年生作物，但是如果实行适当的培育管理，就可以在较短的时间里迅速增加桑叶柞叶的单位产量。浙江省杭州市九堡人民公社，1959年春季新栽二百七十七亩桑园，十个月后每亩平均产叶八百八十二斤，这个速度就非常快。我国的柞林放养柞蚕的还不到五分之一，其余五分之四，只要稍加整理即可放养柞蚕。
    现在全国大部地区已经开始放养春蚕。春蚕比重很大，产量也比较稳定，要高速度发展蚕茧生产，首先要养好春蚕。今年春蚕计划发种量比去年增加40％以上，应当努力发足养好，作到粒粒蚕卵收蚁，条条蚕儿结茧。今年春季桑园肥足、条长、芽多，养蚕的准备工作也比以往任何一年动手早。有了这些良好条件，只要继续努力，争取今年春茧丰收是完全可能的。春茧丰收，不仅完成了全年增产任务的大半，而且可以进一步鼓舞人们的干劲，以春促夏，以夏带秋，夺取今年蚕茧生产全面丰收。
    为了确保今年春蚕生产的全面丰收，各个蚕区应该马上组织力量，对养蚕的准备工作再作一次深入的检查，并把养蚕计划和需要的劳动力进一步落实到包产单位。近年我国新植桑园发展很快，1958年大跃进以来，新栽桑园面积大约相当于解放初期的二倍。我们一定要认真把所有的幼龄桑树管好，保证株株成活，片片成林，使它们及早投入生产。
    蚕桑场是公社化后的新产物，是高速度发展蚕茧生产的基地，也是今后发展蚕桑生产的方向。各地人民公社要把已经建立起来的蚕桑场认真管好，有条件的地区应该积极建立新的蚕桑场，逐步为我国今后的蚕茧生产建立起更加稳固可靠的基础。
    1960年的蚕茧生产已经有了一个良好的开端，可以预料，在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，在人民公社无比优越性的基础上，只要加强党的领导，大搞群众运动，今年的蚕丝生产一定会出现一个全面高产丰收的新局面。
