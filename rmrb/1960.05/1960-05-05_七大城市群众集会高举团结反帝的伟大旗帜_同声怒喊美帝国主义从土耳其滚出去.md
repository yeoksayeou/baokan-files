    Shanghai
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 4th - Over 30,000 young people and people from all walks of life in Shanghai held a grand rally this afternoon in support of the patriotic and just struggle of the Turkish people.
    The rally was held at Jiangwan Stadium in Shanghai. In the afternoon, workers, students, farmers, and neighborhood residents carried huge banners and posters, shouting slogans, and converged on the venue in a mighty procession. Slogans such as "People of the world unite, overthrow imperialism! Down with colonialism!" reverberated through the sky.
    Ke Qingshi, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, First Secretary of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee, and Mayor of Shanghai, Shi Ximin, alternate secretary of the Secretariat of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee, Song Richang, Jin Zhonghua, Zhao Zukang, and Sheng Pihua, vice mayors of Shanghai, leaders of the PLA stationed in Shanghai, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPPCC, heads of local organizations of various democratic parties in Shanghai, and heads of various people's organizations, as well as well-known figures from all walks of life, participated in the rally.

    Li Qitao, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League and Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, spoke at the rally. He said that the raging flames of the struggle against imperialism and for national liberation are now burning more fiercely than ever in all parts of the world. Following the patriotic and just struggle of the South Korean people, the patriotic and just struggle of the Turkish people is another heavy blow to US imperialism.
    Li Qitao said: Countless facts tell us that the nature of imperialism cannot be changed, and the wolf always wants to eat people. Wherever there is imperialism, there is enslavement and oppression, and the people there will suffer disaster. The heroic struggle of the Turkish people has once again exposed the essence of US imperialism and has once again proved that the people's struggle for national independence and democratic freedom cannot be stopped or bound by any force.
    Subsequently, Zhong Min, Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, Wang Xinnan, Deputy Director of the Shanghai Women's Federation, Chen Wangdao, representative of the local organizations of various democratic parties in Shanghai and Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, Wu Tegong, representative of the Islamic community, Wu Xiankang, worker representative, and Wu Dongming, student representative of Fudan University, spoke passionately at the meeting. The angry masses at the venue shouted slogans such as "US Imperialism Get Out of Turkey! Get Out of South Korea! Get Out of South Vietnam ! Get out of Japan! Get Out of the Phillipines! Get out of our territory Taiwan!" "Down with Imperialism!" "Down with Colonialism!" from time to time.
    The People are Invincible
    Tianjin
    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 4th - 30,000 young people and people from all walks of life in Tianjin, the capital of Hebei Province, held a massive rally this afternoon at Minyuan Stadium to support the patriotic and just struggle of the Turkish people.
    In the afternoon, along the streets and alleys on both sides of the Haihe River, workers, members of urban and rural people's communes, militiamen, students, and cadres of institutions and enterprises, flocked to the venue in groups from all directions. Along the way, they waved flags and constantly shouted "Resolutely support the patriotic and just struggle of the Turkish people!" "US Imperialism Get Out of Turkey!" "People of the world unite!" "Down with Imperialism!" and other slogans.
    Responsible persons of the CPC Hebei Provincial Committee, the Hebei Provincial People's Committee, the CPC Tianjin Municipal Committee, the Tianjin Municipal People's Committee, and democratic parties, people's organizations, and higher education institutions in the province and city attended today's rally.
    Zhang Yu, Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, spoke at the rally first. He said: "On the occasion of commemorating the 41st anniversary of the 'May Fourth' Movement, the people and youth of our entire province express our firm support for the patriotic and just struggle of the Turkish people, and express our great anger at the criminal act of US imperialism and its dog, the Menderes reactionary faction, in using violence to suppress demonstrators. The heroic struggle of the Turkish people, like the struggle of the South Korean people against the US-Syngman Rhee clique, is a heavy blow to US imperialism and its running dogs.
    Zhang Yu said: "The Chinese people and youth have spent more than a hundred years of suffering under imperialist aggression and oppression. We deeply know that without driving away imperialism and overthrowing the rule of the reactionaries, there will be no national independence, no economic prosperity, and no consolidated peace. At the same time, we have clearly seen from the glorious road we have traveled: it is not the imperialists, not the traitors, not missiles and hydrogen bombs that determine the course of history, but the awakened masses of the people. The people are invincible, and all imperialists and reactionaries are paper tigers, and they will be driven away and overthrown sooner or later. This is the objective law of historical development that no force can stop." His speech was constantly interrupted by the enthusiastic applause and slogans of the masses.
    Following him, the heads of trade unions and women's federations, and representatives of various democratic parties, workers, peasants, and students also spoke at the meeting. After the meeting, 30,000 people held a demonstration.
    Completely Destroy the Evil Rule of Imperialism
    Shenyang
    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 4th - 30,000 young people and people from all walks of life in Shenyang held a rally this afternoon, resolutely supporting the patriotic and just struggle of the Turkish people against US imperialism and its dog, the Menderes dictatorial rule, and angrily protesting the bloody atrocities of the Turkish reactionary government in suppressing and massacring the Turkish patriotic people.
    Jiao Ruoyu, member of the Standing Committee of the CPC Liaoning Provincial Committee and First Secretary of the CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee, and other provincial and municipal party and government leaders, as well as heads of various people's organizations and local organizations of various democratic parties, participated in the rally. Soviet experts and students from North Korea and Vietnam in Shenyang were also invited to attend the rally.
    Zhang Mingjun, Deputy Secretary of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League and Secretary of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, spoke at the rally first. He said: The storm of the South Korean people against the US-Syngman Rhee clique is in full swing, and on the other side of Asia - Turkey - there has been a large-scale patriotic and just struggle against US imperialism and its dog, the Menderes dictatorial rule. This demonstration by the Turkish people reflects the long-accumulated resentment of the masses against the Menderes regime controlled by US imperialism. The patriotic and just struggles of the Turkish and South Korean people are major events that have shaken US imperialism. This situation shows that the East Wind continues to prevail over the West Wind, and the means by which the United States recruits national scum in Asia and Latin America to enslave the people of various countries are facing failure. The struggle of all oppressed nations for national independence and democracy, like a spring flood, will surely destroy the evil rule of imperialism and colonialism and accelerate their final demise. This cannot be stopped by any reactionaries.
    Representatives of local organizations of various democratic parties in Shenyang, as well as workers, peasants, women, and students, also spoke at the meeting. At the end of the meeting, the whole venue boiled, and people held up signboards, waved flags, and continuously shouted slogans such as "US Imperialism Get Out of Turkey! Get Out of South Korea! Get Out of South Vietnam ! Get out of Japan! Get Out of the Phillipines! Get out of our territory Taiwan!" "Support the anti-imperialist and patriotic struggles of all oppressed nations!" and other slogans.
    Imperialist lackeys are not allowed to massacre the Turkish people
    Xi'an
    Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 4th - More than 20,000 young people and people from all walks of life in Xi'an held a rally this afternoon, resolutely supporting the patriotic and just struggle of the Turkish people.

At the beginning of the rally, Hui Shuchang, Secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, spoke first. He said that the heroic struggle of the Turkish people and youth has made imperialism flustered and the Menderes reactionary government terrified. The overall world situation is developing in a direction that is favorable to the people and unfavorable to imperialism. Imperialism is having an increasingly difficult time, and US imperialism is in a state of siege on all sides.
    Following him, responsible persons of various people's organizations and local organizations of various democratic parties, as well as representatives of young students, workers, peasants, urban commune members, and militiamen, spoke at the meeting. At the end of the meeting, a telegram from the youth and people from all walks of life in Xi'an supporting the patriotic and just struggle of the Turkish people was read out.

On behalf of the youth and people from all walks of life in the province, he expressed deep sympathy and resolute support for the just struggle of the Turkish youth and people against US imperialism and its dog, Menderes. He said: The Turkish reactionary government has served as a lackey and accomplice of US imperialism, bringing heavy disasters to the Turkish people. The Turkish people can no longer endure it. He emphasized: US imperialism and all reactionaries take bloody suppression against the people's revolutionary movement, which does not mean that they are strong, on the contrary, it is precisely the performance of the reactionaries' dying struggle. The present of Syngman Rhee in South Korea will be the future of Menderes in Turkey, as well as the future of some reactionaries such as Kishi Nobusuke in Japan, Ngo Dinh Diem in South Vietnam, and Chiang Kai-shek in Taiwan. The anti-imperialist and patriotic struggle of the Turkish people and all oppressed nations will surely be victorious. His speech was constantly interrupted by the slogans "Resolutely support the patriotic and just struggle of the Turkish people!" "Down with Imperialism!" "Down with Colonialism!"

    The Guangzhou youth, who have a tradition of anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle, expressed great anger at the bloody suppression of patriotic young students and people by US imperialism and its dog, the Menderes traitorous dictatorial government of Turkey, while commemorating the 41st anniversary of the "May Fourth" Movement. The young students, young workers, and militiamen who participated in the rally constantly shouted slogans such as "Resolutely support the patriotic and just struggle of the Turkish people!" "Resolutely oppose the enslavement and massacre of the Turkish patriotic people by US imperialism and its dog!"
    The central venue of the rally was set up in the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall.

    Tan Zhuofen, Secretary of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, delivered a speech at the meeting. He said that the patriotic and just struggle of the Turkish people is by no means accidental. It is the inevitable result of the cruel enslavement and oppression of the Turkish youth and people by US imperialism and its dog, Menderes. He pointed out: Under the brutal rule of US imperialism and the Menderes reactionary government, the Turkish youth and people have reached the point of being unbearable. Encouraged by the heroic struggle of the South Korean people, their resentment accumulated for ten years has erupted like a volcano.

    大会在上海江湾体育场举行。午后，工人、学生、农民、里弄居民抬着巨幅标语和宣传画，高呼口号，浩浩荡荡地向会场集中。“全世界人民团结起来，打倒帝国主义！打倒殖民主义！”等口号声响彻云霄。

    李琦涛说：无数事实告诉我们，帝国主义的本性不可能改变，狼总是要吃人的。哪里有帝国主义，哪里就有奴役和压迫，哪里的人民就要遭受灾难。土耳其人民的英勇斗争，又一次揭露了美帝国主义的本质，也再一次证明人民起来争取民族独立和民主自由的斗争是任何力量都阻挡不住、束缚不了的。

    张玉说：“中国人民和青年曾在帝国主义的侵略和压迫之下度过了苦难的一百多年。我们深深知道不赶走帝国主义，不推翻反动派的统治，就没有民族的独立，就没有经济繁荣，就没有巩固的和平。同时我们从自己所走过的光辉道路中也清楚地看到：决定历史进程的不是帝国主义者，不是卖国贼，不是导弹和氢弹，而是觉醒了的人民群众。人民群众是不可战胜的，一切帝国主义和反动派都是纸老虎，他们迟早是要被赶走和打倒的。这是任何力量也不能阻挡的历史发展的客观规律。”他的讲话，不断被群众的热烈掌声和口号声所打断。
