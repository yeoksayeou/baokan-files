Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 22nd: The Tibet Trade General Company and the Lhasa Municipal Industrial and Commercial Departments are vigorously organizing small factories, workshops, and handicraft workers in Lhasa to utilize local materials, produce locally, and purchase and sell locally, manufacturing more than 1,200 kinds of production materials and daily necessities. Among them, 1,000 kinds were not previously produced in Tibet, and 167 kinds can now be supplied without or with less transfer from the interior.

Under the rule of the three major lords in Tibet in the past, there was very little commodity production, and the people's means of production and daily necessities mostly relied on imports from other places. After the handicraft industry was organized, it is now able to produce products such as iron shovels, hoes, new-style walking plows, waterwheels, windmills, seeders, spinning machines, thermos bottles, porcelain, vermicelli, soap, and pastries, which has greatly helped meet the production and living needs of the people.

In order to support handicraft production, governments and industrial and commercial departments at all levels have provided strong support in terms of raw materials and technology. The industrial and commercial departments have supplied a large amount of raw materials and production tools such as copper, iron, wool, hides, butter, and spinning wheels. The People's Government has also repeatedly sent experienced Han technicians to teach Tibetan workers technology, held on-site meetings to promote experience, and adopted methods such as organizing handicraft workers to visit state-owned factories and sending people to the interior to study, so as to improve the production technology of local handicraft workers. The People's Bank has also issued a large number of loans to support handicraft workers.

In addition, the Lhasa Municipal Industrial and Commercial Departments and various small factories affiliated to the Tibet Military Region are also actively producing production materials using local raw materials to supply the local people. The iron and wood factory affiliated to the commercial department has successfully trial-produced double-wheeled deep plowing walking plows and four-wheeled three-furrow plows in the midst of vigorous technological innovation. Some small factories affiliated to the Tibet Military Region are rushing to produce more than 12,000 pieces of agricultural tools to supply the Tibetan people.

    拉萨工商部门扶持工厂作坊增产商品
    新华社拉萨22日电　西藏贸易总公司和拉萨市工商部门大力组织拉萨市小型工厂、作坊和手工业工人就地取材，就地生产，就地购销，制造出各种生产资料和生活用品一千二百多种。其中，有一千种是西藏过去没有生产过的，有一百六十七种已经可以不从或少从内地调运。
    西藏地区过去在三大领主统治下，很少商品生产，人民生产资料和生活日用品多数依靠从外地输入。手工业生产组织起来后，现在已经能生产铁锹、锄头、新式步犁、水车、风车、播种耧、纺花机、暖水瓶、瓷器、粉条、肥皂、糕点等产品，对适应人民生产和生活需要起了很大作用。
    为了支援手工业生产，各级人民政府和工商部门在原料、技术等方面给予了大力扶持。工商部门供应了大量铜、铁、羊毛、皮张、牛油、纺毛车等各种原料和生产工具，人民政府并多次派有经验的汉族技工向藏族工人传授技术，召开现场会议推广经验，并且采取组织手工业工人到国营工厂参观和派人到内地学习等方法，提高当地手工业工人生产技术。人民银行也发放了大量贷款支援手工业工人。
    除此，拉萨市工商部门和西藏军区所属的各个小型工厂还利用当地原料，积极生产生产资料供应当地人民。商业部门所属铁木工厂在大搞技术革新中，已试制成功双轮深耕步犁和四轮三铧犁等。西藏军区所属的一些小工厂正在赶制一万二千余件农具供应藏族人民。
