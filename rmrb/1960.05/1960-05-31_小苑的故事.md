It was just dawn when the rooster in the yard crowed three times, "Cock-a-doodle-doo!"

I woke up groggily from my sleep and saw Grandma sitting at the table, combing her hair in front of the mirror, combing and combing endlessly. Grandma made a bun of her long hair at the back of her head, put in a hairpin, and touched it with both hands. Then she picked up a small mirror and looked back and forth. For some reason, Grandma wasn't satisfied and took apart the bun she had made. I thought to myself, "Grandma is so old, and she still loves to dress up!"

I was about to laugh when Grandma turned her face and looked towards me. I quickly closed my eyes, pretending I wasn't awake. Luckily, Grandma didn't notice, thinking I was sleeping soundly, so she didn't call me and picked up the comb to comb her hair again.

After Grandma finished combing her hair, she took out a pair of reading glasses from the drawer, put them on and took them off, took them off and put them on again, staring at herself in the mirror for a long time.

I thought to myself, Grandma only does this when something important is happening. What day is it today? I suddenly remembered that Grandma said last night that she would take me to the nursery today!

I stretched and yawned. Grandma didn't notice and went into the inner room. Usually, when Grandma dresses me, she always buttons the top button on my collar, which is quite uncomfortable. Actually, I can dress myself, but Grandma insists on doing it...

While Grandma was inside, I put on my clothes, folded the quilt, and got out of bed. Grandma smiled with narrowed eyes, walked over and buttoned the top button on my shirt collar, saying, "You'll catch a cold if you don't. Button it up, good child!"

After breakfast, Aunt Wang from next door came to call Grandma, saying before she even entered the door, "Grandma, are you ready? It's time to go!"

Grandma replied, "I still have to take Little Yuan to the nursery. You go ahead, I'll be there in a little while!"

I said to Grandma, "I can go by myself, Grandma, you go!"

"You're going by yourself?"
  "Aren't I going to the nursery?"
  "Do you know where the nursery is?" Grandma's question left me speechless.

I went out the gate with Grandma, who held my hand and told me not to run.

There was a big red paper-cut "Happiness" character (I recognized the character) pasted on the gate. I asked what it was for, and Grandma said, "Today, Grandma is going to work in the factory, and you are going to the nursery. The comrades from the neighborhood office came to congratulate our family!"

When we arrived at the nursery gate, the nanny greeted us with a smile, said a few words to Grandma, and patted my face. Grandma was in a hurry to go to the factory, so she left me there. I waved goodbye to Grandma, and I heard the nanny saying, "Don't worry, Grandma!"

The nanny led me to a large room. That room was really wonderful! The glass windows were so bright, there were red flowers in small pots, and there were many goldfish in the glass tank!

The nanny tidied my hair and asked me, "How old are you this year?"

I told the nanny, "I'm six years old. My grandma is fifty-six, and my dad is making revolution in the factory..."

"Making revolution?" The nanny was quite surprised and asked me, "What revolution?"

"A machine revolution! Dad is also inventing things!"

The nanny had two big braids, just like my mom. At lunchtime, she even asked me what I liked to eat, and I said I liked Grandma's braised fish the most.

After that, I don't remember doing anything in particular. I only remember waking up from my nap and calling for Grandma, calling her several times, but Grandma didn't answer. The nanny walked over and said with a smile, "Your grandma isn't here. Okay, get up, we'll play games in a little while!"...

As we played, I saw the sun setting outside the window. The nanny said she would take me home. I thought the nursery was much more fun than home and didn't want to leave. The nanny said, "Grandma is waiting for Little Yuan. Let's go find Grandma together!" When Grandma was mentioned, I had missed her a lot after not seeing her all day.

I ran and jumped all the way out of the nursery gate. The nanny chased after me and grabbed my hand.

As soon as we reached the entrance of our alley, we saw Grandma walking step by step from the toy factory. I said "Goodbye!" to the nanny and ran towards Grandma.

I took Grandma's hand and asked her what she did at the factory today.

When we got home, Grandma said with a smile, "Grandma sewed cloth dolls for the children at the nursery."

I asked Grandma, "Will the eyes of the cloth dolls you sewed turn?"

Grandma said, "They will turn, and they can even talk!"

I felt strange and asked Grandma, "How can cloth dolls talk?"

Grandma smiled and said, "They can talk! Our toy factory is also making a technical revolution, we want to make the cloth dolls talk."

I thought to myself: Tomorrow I must tell the nanny at the nursery that the cloth dolls Grandma sews can also talk!...

    小苑的故事
    宋洪训
    天刚亮，院子里的公鸡“喔—喔—喔”啼了三声。
    我从睡梦中迷迷糊糊地醒来，只见奶奶坐在桌子旁边对着镜子梳头，梳啊梳的，梳个没完。奶奶把长头发在脑勺后面挽了个结，插上了发夹子，还用两手摸了摸，又拿起一面小镜子，来回的照着。不知怎么的，奶奶不满意，又把挽好的发结给拆了。我心里暗暗想：“奶奶那么大年岁了，还真爱打扮呢！”
    我刚想笑出来，奶奶转过脸来，朝我这边望了望。我连忙闭起眼睛，假装还没醒。幸好奶奶没发现，以为我睡得正香，也就没叫我，又拿起梳子梳她的头了。
    奶奶梳完头，从抽屉里拿出一副老花眼镜，戴了又脱下，脱下又戴上，对着镜子望了老半天。
    我心想，只有遇到什么大事，奶奶才这样，今天是什么日子呢？我忽然想起来，奶奶昨天夜里说，今儿要送我上托儿所哩！
    我伸了伸手，打了个呵欠。奶奶没察觉，反倒进里屋去了。平时，奶奶替我穿衣服，总要把领子上的那颗扣子也扣上，怪不舒服的。其实啊，衣服我自个也会穿，可奶奶偏要……
    趁奶奶进去这功夫，我穿好了衣服，把被子折叠起来，就下床了。奶奶眯着眼睛笑了笑，走过来又把我衬衣领子上的那颗扣子扣上，还说：“这样会着凉，扣上，好孩子！”
    吃过早点，隔壁王家姑姑来叫奶奶，还没进门就说：“奶奶，收拾完了吗？该走啦！”
    奶奶回答说：“我还得送小苑上托儿所哪，您先走吧，我过一会就去！”
    我对奶奶说：“我自个儿会去，奶奶，你走吧！”
    “你自个上哪儿去？”
      “不是上托儿所吗？”
      “你知道托儿所在哪儿？”奶奶这一问，我不知道怎么说才好了。
    我跟奶奶出了大门，奶奶拉着我的手，叫我别跑。
    大门口贴着个红纸剪的大“喜”字（我认得这字），我问这是干什么的，奶奶说：“今儿奶奶进工厂做工，你也上托儿所，这是街道办事处的同志给咱们家道喜来了！”
  到了托儿所门口，阿姨笑着迎过来，跟奶奶说了几句话，还摸了摸我的脸蛋。奶奶急着要去工厂，就把我留下了。我跟奶奶招了招手，只听阿姨在说：“放心吧，奶奶！”
    阿姨把我领到一间大屋子里，那屋子可真棒！玻璃窗擦得倍儿亮，小盆里种着红红的花，玻璃缸里还养着好些金鱼呢！
    阿姨给我整了整头发，问我：“今年几岁啦？”
    我告诉阿姨说：“六岁啦，我奶奶五十六，爸爸在工厂里闹革命……”
    “闹革命？”阿姨挺奇怪，问我：“闹什么革命？”
    “机器革命呗！爸爸还发明呢？”
    阿姨跟我妈妈一样，梳着两条大辫子。吃中饭的时候，还问我喜欢吃什么，我说顶喜欢吃奶奶作的大鱼。
    这以后，我也不知道干了些什么。只记得睡完午觉醒来，我就叫奶奶，一连叫了好几声，可奶奶没理我。阿姨走过来笑着对我说：“你奶奶不在这儿，好，起来吧，过一会咱们还做游戏呢！”……
    玩着玩着，只见窗外的太阳快下山了。阿姨说要送我回家，我觉着托儿所比家里好玩得多，不肯走，阿姨说：“奶奶等着小苑哪，走，咱们一块儿找奶奶去！”一提起奶奶，一天没见，倒也想得很。
    我一边跑一边跳，出了托儿所的大门，阿姨在后面追上来，拉住了我的手。
    刚到咱们家胡同口，就看见奶奶打玩具厂那边一步一步地走过来，我跟阿姨说了声“再见！”就冲着奶奶跑过去。
    我拉住奶奶的手，问她今天在工厂里做什么。
    到家，奶奶笑着对我说：“奶奶给托儿所的孩子们缝布娃娃。”
    我问奶奶：“你缝的布娃娃眼珠会转吗？”
    奶奶说：“会转，还会说话哪！”
    我觉着奇怪，又问奶奶：“布娃娃怎么会说话？”
    奶奶笑了笑说：“会说！我们玩具厂也闹技术革命，要叫布娃娃说话。”
    我心里想：明天我一定告诉托儿所的阿姨，奶奶缝的布娃娃还会说话呢！……
