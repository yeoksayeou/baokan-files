　　Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 28th -- The World Federation of Democratic Youth issued a statement here, expressing warm support for the just struggle of Japanese youth against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

　　The statement said that the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" attempts to legalize the long-term stationing of American troops in Japan and the maintenance of nuclear war bases in Japan; at the same time, it seeks to intensify the revival of Japanese militarism. The World Federation of Democratic Youth attaches great importance to the heroic struggle of the Japanese people and youth, believing that this struggle is a heavy blow to the war preparations plans of the American and Japanese militarist groups.

　　The statement pointed out that the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" is an openly aggressive military alliance against the Soviet Union, China, and Korea. This treaty violates the Potsdam Agreement and the United Nations Charter. It not only endangers peace in Asia but also places a heavy economic burden on the Japanese people, attempting to eliminate democracy in Japan and expose Japan to retaliatory atomic strikes in the event of war. This treaty is also a direct factor in provoking war, as it legalizes the bases for "U-2" type aircraft used for espionage activities that were recently exposed.

　　The statement called on all youth organizations in all countries and international organizations to fully support the struggle of Japanese youth, pointing out that this struggle is also a struggle for all peace-loving people.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, 26th -- The Romanian newspaper "Labor News" published an article today pointing out that Kishi Nobusuke's shameless and violent method of forcibly "passing" the new U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty in the House of Representatives is sufficient to prove that the entire Japanese people, many political parties, and mass organizations, with the exception of a small handful of militarist reactionaries, are resolutely opposed to Japan forming an aggressive alliance with U.S. militarism.

　　The article expressed support for the Japanese people's struggle against the new U.S.-Japan military treaty. The article said that the U.S.-Japan military alliance directly threatens the existence of the Japanese nation and the Japanese state. If the Japanese Diet "ratifies" this military treaty, it will mean linking Japan with the aggressive policies of the United States, which will bring the greatest misfortune to the Japanese people. This treaty means the occupation of Japan by U.S. troops and the intensification of arming Japan with weapons, including nuclear weapons and missiles.

　　The article said that recent events have shown that the Japanese people are resolutely waging a persistent struggle against the adventurous policies of the Japanese government and against its policy of subservience to Washington's aggressive policies.

    世界青联声援日本青年斗争
    罗报谴责岸信介集团非法强行通过日美条约
　　据新华社布达佩斯28日电　世界民主青年联盟在这里发表声明，热烈支持日本青年反对日美“安全条约”的正义斗争。
    声明说，日美“安全条约”企图使美国军队长期驻扎日本，使保持在日本的核战争基地的做法合法化；同时要加紧复活日本军国主义。世界民主青年联盟非常重视日本人民和青年进行的英勇斗争，认为这种斗争是对美国和日本的军国主义集团策划的备战计划的沉重打击。
    声明指出，日美“安全条约”是公开对付苏联、中国和朝鲜的侵略性军事同盟，这项条约违反了波茨坦协定和联合国宪章。它不仅危及亚洲和平，而且把沉重的经济负担加在日本人民身上，企图取消日本的民主，使日本在一旦发生战争时遭到报复性的原子打击。这一条约也是挑起战争的直接因素，因为这项条约使最近被揭露的进行间谍活动的停放“U—2”型飞机的基地合法化。
    声明要求各国和国际的所有青年组织完全支持日本青年的斗争，指出这个斗争也是所有爱好和平的人的斗争。
    据新华社布加勒斯特26日电　罗马尼亚“劳动报”今天发表文章指出，岸信介用无耻的暴力方法强行众议院“通过”美日新军事同盟条约，这足以证明，除一小撮军国主义反动分子外，全体日本人民、许多政党和群众组织是坚决反对日本与美国军国主义结成侵略同盟的。
    文章表示支持日本人民反对日美新军事条约的斗争。文章说，美日军事同盟直接威胁着日本民族和日本国家的存在。如果日本国会“批准”这个军事条约，这将意味着把日本与美国的侵略政策联系在一起，而这就会给日本人民带来最大的不幸。这个条约意味着美军占领日本和加紧用包括核武器和导弹武器在内的武器武装日本。
    文章说，最近的事件表明，日本人民是坚决为反对日本政府的冒险政策、为反对它奉行的向华盛顿侵略政策屈膝的政策而进行坚持不懈的斗争。
