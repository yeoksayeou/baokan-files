(Comprehensive report from our newspaper) According to Xinhua News Agency: The delegations attending the Latin American Conference for Solidarity with the Cuban Revolution, in a call to the people of Latin America passed on the morning of the 1st, unanimously decided to "express the warmest support to the heroic Cuban Revolution." The call emphasized that "Cuba has become a model for all Latin American people to learn from." The call stated, "Cuba's cause is our cause, and the aggression against Cuba that US imperialism is preparing to launch is aggression against all the people of this continent."

The call revealed that "our common and primary enemy—US imperialism—is stepping up preparations for aggression against Cuba." The call pointed out that in order to realize its plans, the reactionary forces have colluded with criminals and agents who once served Batista, Latin American dictators, and certain so-called democratic governments. The call emphasized that "the conflict provoked by the Guatemalan government to create an atmosphere for armed aggression against Cuba" is yet another in a series of provocations.

The call also included the following resolutions passed by the conference:

*   Establish a liaison committee with its headquarters in Caracas, the capital of Venezuela, and establish solidarity committees in every Latin American country to publicize the revolutionary cause of Cuba, condemn and oppose the planned aggression and slanderous propaganda against the Cuban Revolution. The Liaison Committee will also be responsible for promoting meetings in various countries in order to eventually hold a Latin American People's Congress.

*   Organize fundraising activities to purchase weapons, aircraft, tractors, etc. to support the Cuban Revolution, register volunteers, and hold mass activities to stop aggression and defend Cuba in the event of an attack on Cuba.

*   Intensify a vigorous propaganda campaign to urge Latin American countries to participate in the conference of underdeveloped countries in Havana.

*   Central trade unions in various countries should reach agreements to prevent any activities that the United States might undertake, such as using oil, steel, iron, tin, sulfur, and other resources provided by Latin American countries for military purposes to invade Cuba.

*   Condemn the threats used by the Organization of American States to diplomatically isolate Cuba and carry out multilateral aggression.

*   Promote frequent cultural and scientific exchanges between Cuba and its Latin American sister countries.

The Latin American Conference for Solidarity with the Cuban Revolution opened in Havana on the morning of April 30.

Before the opening of the conference, the delegates laid wreaths at the monuments of Martí, Bolívar, and Juárez, the national heroes of Cuba, Venezuela, and Mexico.

The delegations shouted slogans such as "Cuba yes, Yankees no!" in the streets and then arrived at the House of Representatives meeting hall in the former Capitol Building for the opening ceremony of the conference. The conference elected a presidium composed of one representative from each country.

Waldo Frank, a well-known American writer and initiator of the American "Fair Play for Cuba Committee," was invited to participate in the conference and received a warm welcome from the delegates.

On the afternoon of the 30th, delegates from various countries attending the conference unanimously expressed their determination to defend the Cuban Revolution and fight back against US imperialist plots of aggression. They said that if the Cuban people were to be invaded, the people of Latin American countries would stand with the Cuban people.

On May 1st, in addition to passing the call to action, the final session of the conference also passed the following resolutions: To fight for the independence of Puerto Rico and for the release of Nationalist leader Albizu Campos and other pro-independence fighters imprisoned in Puerto Rico and the United States.

Support the Panamanian people's demands for sovereignty over the Canal. Condemn the imperialist plans, conducted through the International Monetary Fund, aimed at further dominating the economies of Latin American countries.

Release all trade union and political prisoners imprisoned in some Latin American countries, who have been subjected to barbaric imprisonment and torture in their struggle for the liberation of the people of their countries. Abolish all repressive laws, which, under the pretext of defending democracy, have become tools for abolishing democracy.

    拉丁美洲声援古巴革命大会发出号召书
    古巴已成为全拉丁美洲人民学习的榜样
    参加大会的各国代表一致表示决心捍卫古巴革命反击美帝国主义侵略阴谋
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：出席拉丁美洲声援古巴革命大会的各国代表团在1日清晨通过致拉丁美洲各国人民的号召书，一致决定“向英雄的古巴革命表示最热烈的支持”。号召书强调指出：“古巴已经成为全拉丁美洲人民学习的榜样”。号召书说，“古巴的事业就是我们的事业，美帝国主义准备发动的对古巴的侵略就是对本大陆所有人民的侵略”。
    号召书揭露说，“我们共同的和主要的敌人——美帝国主义正在加紧侵略古巴的准备活动”。号召书指出，为了实现其计划，反动势力勾结了曾经为巴蒂斯塔效劳的罪犯和特务，拉丁美洲的独裁者以及某些所谓的民主政府。号召书强调说，“目前，危地马拉政府为制造武装侵略古巴的气氛所挑起的冲突”是一系列挑衅中的再一次挑衅。
    号召书的内容还包括了大会通过的下列决议：
    建立会址设在委内瑞拉首都加拉加斯的联络委员会，并在拉丁美洲每个国家建立声援委员会，以便宣传古巴的革命事业，谴责和反对正在策划的对古巴革命的侵略和诽谤性的宣传。联络委员会还将负责推动各国举行会议，以便最后举行拉丁美洲人民大会。
    主办用来购买支援古巴革命的武器、飞机、拖拉机等的募捐活动，登记志愿者和举行群众活动，以便在古巴受到攻击时制止侵略和保卫古巴。
    加紧展开热烈的宣传运动，促使拉丁美洲国家参加在哈瓦那举行的不发达国家会议。
    各国的中央工会之间达成协议，阻止美国可能进行的任何活动，如利用拉丁美洲国家提供的石油、钢、铁、锡、硫磺及其他用于军事的资源来侵略古巴。
    谴责美洲国家组织为了在外交上封锁古巴和进行多边侵略而使用的威胁。
    促进古巴及其拉丁美洲姊妹国家之间的文化、科学的经常往来。
    拉丁美洲声援古巴革命大会是4月30日上午在哈瓦那开幕的。
    会议开幕之前，代表们向古巴、委内瑞拉和墨西哥的民族英雄马蒂、博利瓦尔和胡亚雷斯的纪念碑献了花。
    各代表团在大街上高呼“要古巴不要美国佬”的口号，然后到达前国会大厦的众议院会议厅，举行会议的开幕式。会议选出了由各国代表各一人组成的主席团。
    美国著名作家、美国“争取公平对待古巴委员会”发起人沃耳宝·弗兰克应邀参加了会议，受到代表们的热烈欢迎。
    30日下午，参加大会的各国代表一致表示，决心保卫古巴革命，反击美帝国主义侵略阴谋。他们说，假如古巴人民一旦遭到侵略，拉丁美洲各国人民将站在古巴人民一边。
    5月1日，在大会最后一次会议上除了通过号召书外，还通过了下列决议：为波多黎各的独立，为释放国民党领导人阿耳维苏·坎波斯及其他被监禁在波多黎各和美国的争取独立的战士而斗争。
    支持巴拿马人民对运河主权的要求。谴责帝国主义通过国际货币基金组织进行的目的在于进一步统治拉丁美洲各国经济的计划。
    释放在拉丁美洲一些国家中被监禁的一切工会犯和政治犯，这些工会犯和政治犯在他们争取各国人民解放的斗争中遭到蛮横的监禁和拷打。废除所有镇压性的法律，这些法律在保卫民主的借口下，变成了取消民主的工具。
