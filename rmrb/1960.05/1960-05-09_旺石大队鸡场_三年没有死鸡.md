    Wangshi Brigade Chicken Farm
    No Chicken Deaths in Three Years

    The Wangshi Brigade Chicken Farm in Xiaopingshan Commune, Yulin County, Guangxi, has not had a single chicken death in the three years since its establishment. As a result, the number of chickens has grown rapidly, increasing more than 45 times in three years.

    Their experience is that the Party branch sends people to specifically lead the chicken raising work; selects people with chicken raising experience to serve as technicians to visit experts and learn from experience everywhere; strengthens ideological education to make commune members realize the role of developing poultry in increasing commune income. At the same time, they use a combination of indigenous and foreign methods to manufacture medicines to prevent chicken diseases. They usually ensure that the chickens are clean, the feed is clean, the utensils are clean, and the inside and outside of the pens are tidy. If chicken diseases are discovered, strict sealing, isolation, and disinfection are immediately implemented.

    旺石大队鸡场
    三年没有死鸡
    广西玉林县小平山公社旺石大队鸡场，建场三年来没有死过一只鸡。因此，鸡只发展很快，在三年中增长了四十五倍多。
    他们的经验是党支部派人具体领导养鸡工作；选派有养鸡经验的人充任技术员到处访贤、取经；加强思想教育，使社员认识到发展家禽对于增加公社收入的作用。同时，采用土洋结合的办法制造药品，预防鸡病。平时做到鸡身清洁，饲料清洁，用具清洁，栏内栏外整洁。发现鸡病以后立即严格封锁隔离和消毒。
