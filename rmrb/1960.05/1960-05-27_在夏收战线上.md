On the Summer Harvest Front

    Hebei Cotton Region Fights Drought, Protects Seedlings, and Replants
    People's communes in Hebei Province, a major cotton-producing area in China, are intensifying cotton seedling management to ensure planting area, density, and strong seedlings, with no breaks in the rows and no missing plants.
    Since last winter, Hebei Province has experienced scarce rain and snow, leading to a severe drought. Some cotton fields have lost moisture, resulting in missing seedlings and broken rows. The county secretary of Nangong County took the lead, and workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and merchants all participated, forming a 250,000-person seedling management team. They adopted a comprehensive approach of watering, replanting, transplanting, weeding, and pest control to protect the seedlings. As a result, all of the county's 1.1 million mu of cotton fields have been universally transplanted, replanted, irrigated with middle plowing, and now all the seedlings are full, strong, and growing well. Ten communes in Gaocheng County, including Wuji and Datong, launched a "Five Checks and Five Replacements" campaign, checking field heads, roadsides, row ditches, well platforms, and small paths.
  
  Shandong Strengthens Field Management of Spring-Sown Crops
    People's communes in Shandong Province are starting early to strengthen spring seedling management, striving for full stands in every mu, robust plants, and the elimination of third-class seedlings during the seedling stage.
    In the face of continued drought, Shandong is boosting morale and first focusing on high-yield fields, assigning dedicated personnel for management, conducting thorough checks and replacements, and making concentrated efforts to eliminate missing and weak seedlings. More than 5 million mu of spring fields with missing seedlings, identified by six special cities including Linyi and Qingdao, have been mostly replanted through intensive efforts. The inspection team organized by the Liaocheng Special Zone brought tools and seeds to the fields for inspection, ensuring replanting was done immediately after inspection.
    While focusing on the management of high-yield fields, various localities also paid attention to the management of distant and low-yield fields. Some areas adopted methods such as fertilizing distant fields before nearby fields, and poor fields before fertile fields, applying high-quality fertilizers to both distant and poor fields to promote balanced growth of spring seedlings.
      
  Qinghai's Spring Planting Area Increases by 70% Compared to Last Year
    Under the battle cry of "opening up wasteland while sowing" and "mobilizing the entire party and the entire people, with all sectors supporting," spring plowing and sowing in Qinghai Province has already sown more than 12.48 million mu, expanding the total sown area by about 70% compared to last year.
    Currently, spring wheat and highland barley along the Yellow River and Huangshui River in the eastern agricultural region have grown to a height of four to five inches. On the newly reclaimed land on the grasslands of Yushu and Guoluo Tibetan Autonomous Prefectures at the source of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, crops have also begun to break ground and sprout.
          
  Heilongjiang Greatly Improves Tillage Tools
    The movement to reform and promote tillage tools in Heilongjiang Province has entered a high tide.
    Based on this year's widespread changes in the province, from large ridges to small ridges, sparse planting to dense planting, and major reforms in the cultivation system, various localities have manufactured a large number of high-efficiency and high-quality tillage tools, mainly tractor-drawn and animal-powered implements. Most of these tools can apply fertilizer while tilling the land. All tractors in Hailun County are equipped with tillage implements. People's communes in Hulan County comprehensively utilize new-style animal-powered seeders, using them for sowing in the spring and installing hoe blades for summer hoeing, using the seed box as a fertilizer box, which can till several ridges at a time and also apply fertilizer. The rotary weeder manufactured in Yian County can both weed and thin seedlings, making it very suitable for thinning work with this year's increased planting density.
  
  Shaanxi Southern Rapeseed Harvest
    Hanzhong and Ankang Special Zones in southern Shaanxi begin to harvest rapeseed. Hanzhong Special Zone has harvested nearly half, and according to the harvesting situation, yields are generally higher than last year. The Baijiaba Production Team of Bailong Commune in Xixiang County achieved a yield of more than 300 jin per mu on ten mu of rapeseed, which is 40 jin higher than last year.
    This year, the rapeseed in these two special zones has been well-planted and carefully managed, growing tall and large, with thick stems, dense branches, and pods full of grain. To ensure a bumper harvest, the communes have made proper arrangements for tools and labor in advance.
  
  Hukou County Rapeseed Achieves
    Large-Area Balanced High Yield
    Hukou County, Jiangxi Province, has achieved another bumper harvest of rapeseed on more than 58,000 mu this year, with a total output increase of 60.8% compared to last year.
    The biggest characteristic of this year's rapeseed harvest in Hukou is the large-area balanced high yield, which has basically eliminated the past phenomenon of large disparities in yield. According to county-wide surveys, rapeseed yields have been universally high this year, regardless of whether it is planted in plains, mountains, good fields, or poor fields.
  
  Danyang Harvests Early by Half a Month
    Rushes to Harvest Barley and Wheat
    Cadres at all four levels in Danyang County, Jiangsu Province, join forces in the fields with the urban and rural labor force to rush to harvest barley and wheat. After two days of preparation, two days of combat, and one day of finishing, all 327,000 mu of barley and wheat in the county that had turned yellow and ripened were harvested before the rainstorm on the 17th, half a month earlier than last year, and the entire harvest time was only half of last year.
  
  Wusheng County's Summer Harvest is Fast and Good
    The summer harvest period in Wusheng County, Sichuan, was shortened by half compared to last year, and more than 300,000 mu of summer harvest crops were harvested quickly and well.
    Taking all measures to ensure a fast and good harvest is the prominent feature of Wusheng County's summer harvest this year. Long before the start of the summer harvest, the county's summer harvest tools were fully prepared. On average, each laborer in the county had a sickle, each production team had 20 carrying baskets, and other tools and related equipment such as flails, mats, drying grounds, factory sheds, and warehouses were also ready.
    All sectors in the county also drew more than 29,000 laborers to invest in the front line of agricultural production. In addition to leaving a few percent of the labor force for field management and logistics work, all the labor force in the rural people's communes was also fully invested in the summer harvest.
  
  Shixi Production Team
    Wheat Yield Doubles
    The Shixi Production Team of the Suburban Commune in Qingtian County, Zhejiang Province, achieved a great wheat harvest this year. After harvesting, threshing, and cleaning, the team's 486 mu of wheat averaged 627 jin per mu, an increase of more than 50% compared to last year. Among them, 61 mu of wheat high-yield experimental fields averaged 824 jin per mu. At the same time, due to the expansion of the area, the total output has increased by more than double compared to last year.
    In 1958, the wheat yield per mu of the Shixi Production Team jumped from more than 100 jin in the past to 208 jin. In 1959, it jumped to 402 jin. This year, it has achieved an even greater harvest on the basis of the previous two years. The broad masses of commune members unanimously reflected that this is the victory of the Party's leadership, and the victory of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune. Yongding Commune Achieves a Large Increase in Small Spring Production
    The Yongding People's Commune in Yao County, Yunnan Province, has achieved a bumper harvest of small spring crops, with a total output increase of 80.5% compared to last year.
    This commune, located on the banks of the Jinsha River and including 20,000 Han, Yi, Hui, and Lisu people, did not have the habit of planting small spring crops in the past, and the yield of small spring crops was very low. This year, the broad masses of cadres and commune members implemented the principle of combining high yield with more harvesting, and more planting with more harvesting, planting 44,000 mu of small spring crops. After a winter and spring of combat, the broad masses of commune members have achieved a bumper harvest of small spring crops. (With picture)

    在夏收战线上
    河北棉区抗旱保苗补苗
    我国盛产棉花的河北省棉区各人民公社，正在加紧进行棉花苗期管理工作，要求达到保面积、保密度、保苗壮，寸垅不断，根苗不缺。
    去冬以来，河北省雨雪稀少，旱情严重。部分棉田失墒欠墒，出现了缺苗断垅现象。南宫县书记挂帅，工农兵学商齐出动，组成了二十五万人的幼苗管理队伍，采取浇、补、移、锄、治一条龙的保苗措施，使全县一百一十多万亩棉田普遍经过移苗补种、中耕浇水，现在全部棉田苗全苗壮，生长很好。藁城县的无极、大同等十个公社，开展了查地头、查道边、查垅沟、查井台、查小道的五查五补运动。
  山东加强春播作物田间管理
    山东省各地人民公社及早动手，加强春苗管理，力争亩亩全苗，棵棵健壮，把三类苗消灭在幼苗期。
    在干旱持续发展的情况下，山东各地人民鼓足干劲，首先抓住丰产田，指定专人管理，大查大补，突击消灭缺苗、弱苗。临沂、青岛等六个专市检查出的五百多万亩缺苗春田，大部分已经突击补上种。聊城专区组织的检查队，带工具、带种子下田检查，做到了随检查、随补种。
    各地在大抓丰产田管理的同时，还注意了远田、低产田的管理。有些地区在施肥上采用了先远田后近田，先瘦田后肥田，远田瘦田并施优质肥料等方法，促进春苗平衡生长。
      青海春播面积比去年增70％
    青海省的春耕播种在“一边开荒，一边播种”、“全党全民总动员，各行各业都支援”的战斗口号下，已经播种一千二百四十八万多亩，比去年的总播种面积扩大了70％左右。
    目前东部农业区黄河、湟水沿岸的春小麦和青稞已经苗高四五寸，在长江、黄河源头的玉树和果洛藏族自治州草原的新垦地上，庄稼也开始破土出苗。
          黑龙江大改中耕工具
    黑龙江省改革、推广中耕工具的活动进入高潮。
    根据今年全省普遍把大垅改为小垅，稀植改为密植，耕作制度大改革的情况，各地制造了大批以机引农具和畜力农具为主的工效高、作业质量好的中耕工具。其中大部分工具都可以一面追肥，一面趟地。海伦县全部拖拉机都配备上了中耕拖带农具。呼兰县各人民公社综合利用新式畜力播种机，春耕用它播种；夏锄就安装上锄刀，利用种子箱做肥箱，一次能趟几条垅，又能追肥。依安县制造的旋转式除草机，既能除草，又能间苗，很适合今年密植程度增大的间苗工作。
  陕南油菜丰收
    陕南汉中、安康专区开镰收割油菜。汉中专区已收割近一半，根据收打情况看，一般都比去年增产。西乡县白龙公社白家坝生产队十亩油菜，亩产达到三百多斤，较去年高出四十斤。
    今年这两个专区的油菜，种的好，管的细，长得又高又大，秆粗枝密，荚荚满粒。为了保证丰产丰收，各公社事先对工具、劳力作了妥善安排。
  湖口县油菜
    大面积平衡高产
    江西省湖口县，今年五万八千多亩油菜又获得丰收，总产量比去年增长了百分之六十点八。
    今年湖口油菜丰收的最大特点是大面积平衡高产，基本上消灭了过去产量高低悬殊的现象。据全县调查，无论平原、山区、好田、坏田，今年的油菜普遍丰收。
  丹阳提早半个月
    抢收元麦和大麦
    江苏省丹阳县四级干部会师田头，与城乡劳动大军一道突击抢收元麦、大麦。经过两天准备，两天战斗，一天扫尾，全县已黄熟的三十二万七千亩元麦、大麦，在十七日暴雨到来前全部抢收登场，季节比去年提早半个月，整个收割时间只有去年的一半。
  武胜县夏收快又好
    四川武胜县的夏收期比去年缩短了一半，三十多万亩夏收作物收得又快又好。
    采取一切措施，保证快收、收好，是武胜县今年夏收的突出特点。远在夏收开始以前，这个县的夏收工具准备得停停当当，全县平均每个劳动力都有一把镰刀，每个生产队都有二十副挑筐，其他如连枷、围席、晒坝、厂棚、仓库等工具和有关设备也都早已齐备。
    全县各行各业还抽出劳动力二万九千多人，投入农业生产第一线。农村人民公社除留下百分之几的劳动力搞田间管理和后勤工作外，所有劳力也都全部投入夏收。
  石溪生产队
    小麦产量增一倍
    浙江省青田县城郊公社石溪生产队今年获得小麦大丰收。全队四百八十六亩小麦经收打扬净验收，平均亩产六百二十七斤，比去年增产百分之五十以上，其中有六十一亩小麦丰产试验田，平均亩产八百二十四斤。同时，由于面积扩大，总产量比去年跃增一倍多。
    一九五八年，石溪生产队小麦亩产由过去一百多斤跃到二百零八斤，一九五九年跃到四百零二斤，今年又在前两年的基础上获得了更大丰收。广大社员一致反映：这是党领导的胜利，是总路线、大跃进、人民公社的胜利。永定公社小春大增产
    云南省大姚县永定人民公社小春作物丰收，总产量比去年增长百分之八十点五。
    这个位于金沙江畔包括汉、彝、回傈僳族共两万人的公社，过去没有种小春的习惯，小春作物产量很低。今年广大干部和社员贯彻高产多收多种多收相结合的方针，种植小春作物四万四千亩。广大社员经过一冬春的战斗，获得小春丰收。（附图片）
