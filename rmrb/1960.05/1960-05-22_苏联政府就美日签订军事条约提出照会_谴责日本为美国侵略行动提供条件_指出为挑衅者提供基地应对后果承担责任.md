Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 21st. TASS reported from Moscow on the 21st: The Soviet government delivered a note to the Japanese government regarding the issue of the new US-Japan military treaty.

The note stated that the Soviet government urges the Japanese government to pay attention to the fact that the Japanese government's signing of a new military treaty with the United States, providing its national territory as a base for the US Air Force whose mission is to take hostile actions against the Soviet Union, undermines the foundation of peace and good relations between the two countries.

This note was delivered by Soviet First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Kuznetsov, to the Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Suemitsu Kadowaki, on the 20th. The note recounts that the Soviet government has repeatedly warned the Japanese government that Japan's signing of a new military treaty with the United States and the utilization of Japanese territory for the purpose of aggression against the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries would lead to dangerous consequences.

The note points out that the Japanese government has not drawn the due conclusions from the Soviet government's warnings. The note emphasizes that the incident of the American military aircraft, which intruded into Soviet airspace with espionage purposes on May 1st and was shot down by the Soviet rocket forces, irrefutably proves the aggressive purpose of these military treaties, based on which the United States sets up its military bases on the territory of its treaty countries and uses these bases to carry out provocative activities against the Soviet Union.

The note states that it has been ascertained that American aircraft based on the Japanese islands have intruded into Soviet airspace more than once. With the consent and assistance of the Japanese government, the US command has been using and is still using Japanese territory to conduct war preparations and aerial reconnaissance against the Soviet Union and countries friendly to the Soviet Union.

The note emphasizes that the Japanese government is deliberately complicating the situation by engaging in military collusion with a country that declares espionage, sabotage, and the violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of other countries as its national policy. The Soviet government certainly cannot ignore the fact that the signing of a new military treaty between the United States and Japan is precisely to provide conditions for carrying out aggressive actions against the Soviet Union and countries friendly to the Soviet Union from Japanese territory.

The note finally emphasizes that, therefore, the Japanese government will inevitably bear responsibility for the consequences that may arise from provocations against the Soviet Union launched from Japanese territory.

    苏联政府就美日签订军事条约提出照会
    谴责日本为美国侵略行动提供条件
    指出为挑衅者提供基地应对后果承担责任
    新华社21日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科21日讯：苏联政府就美日签订新军事条约问题送交日本政府一份照会。
    照会说，苏联政府促请日本政府注意，日本政府同美国签订新的军事条约，提供本国领土给任务在于对苏联采取敌视行动的美国空军作为基地，这就破坏了两国间的和平和良好关系的基础。
    这份照会是由苏联外交部第一副部长库兹?佐夫20日交给日本驻苏联大使门胁季光的。照会中追述说，苏联政府曾不止一次地警告日本政府，日本同美国签订新的军事条约以及日本领土被利用来达到侵略苏联和其他爱好和平国家的目的，会导致危险的后果。
    照会指出，日本政府并没有从苏联政府的警告中得出应有的结论。照会强调说，5月1日抱着间谍目的侵入苏联领空而被苏联火箭部队击落的美国军用飞机的事件，不可争辩地证明了这种军事条约的侵略目的，美国正是根据这些条约在其缔约国的领土上设置自己的军事基地，并利用这些基地对苏联进行挑衅活动。
    照会说，已经查明，以日本岛屿为基地的美国飞机不止一次地侵入苏联领空。美国司令部在日本政府的同意和协助下过去和现在都在利用日本领土进行备战活动并对苏联和同苏联友好的国家进行空中侦察。
    照会强调说，日本政府蓄意使局势复杂化，它同一个把间谍活动、破坏活动、破坏别国主权和领土的不可侵犯性宣布为本国国策的国家进行军事勾结。苏联政府当然不能无视这样的事实：美国和日本之间签订新的军事条约正是为了给从日本领土上对苏联和同苏联友好的国家实行侵略行动提供条件。
    照会最后强调说，因此，日本政府不可避免地要对从日本领土对苏联进行挑衅可能产生的后果承担责任。
