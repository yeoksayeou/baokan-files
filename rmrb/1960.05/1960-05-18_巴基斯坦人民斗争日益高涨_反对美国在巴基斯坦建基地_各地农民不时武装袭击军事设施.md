Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 16th May: The "Delhi Times" weekly, published on May 15th, reported that the Pakistani people's struggle against the construction of U.S. military facilities on their territory is increasingly surging. The Pakistani authorities and local people are constantly in conflict over this.

The newspaper said that this news was revealed by Pakistanis visiting relatives and friends in India. According to them, at the end of 1959, when the Americans requested to occupy a large area of land near Batkhel, fifteen kilometers south of Peshawar, to build military facilities, the Pakistani local authorities attempted to requisition these lands from the farmers, thus causing organized resistance. Leaflets calling on the people to support the farmers appeared in Peshawar. The Pakistani authorities used force to drive the farmers away from these places.

The news also said that the conflicts there continue to occur. The evicted farmers entered the mountains, and they occasionally launch armed attacks on the military facilities under construction.

The news said that the Pakistani "Dawn" newspaper admitted on April 4th that in Batkhel, armed conflicts recently occurred between farmers and the Pakistani authorities due to land issues, and some people were injured.

The news said that the same conflict occurred in Gurguri, forty-five kilometers south of Peshawar. The Americans attempted to build an airport there. It is said that the local people put up armed resistance and refused to leave their land, and they still occupy their land now.

The news also said that in Hunza, Pakistan, the local people refused to provide any assistance to the Americans building roads.

The "Delhi Times" weekly said that the above events show that the measures to establish U.S. military bases in Pakistan are unpopular.

    巴基斯坦人民斗争日益高涨
    反对美国在巴基斯坦建基地
    各地农民不时武装袭击军事设施
    新华社新德里16日电　5月15日出版的“德里时代”周报报道，巴基斯坦人民反抗在他们的领土内修建美国军事设施的斗争日益高涨。巴基斯坦当局和地方人民为此不断发生冲突。
    这家报纸说，这些消息是到印度访问亲友的巴基斯坦人透露的。据他们透露，在1959年底，美国人要求占用白沙瓦以南十五公里的巴特赫尔城附近的大片土地来修建军事设施时，巴基斯坦地方当局企图向农民征用这些土地，因此引起了有组织的反抗。在白沙瓦曾经出现呼吁人民支持农民的传单。巴基斯坦当局使用了武力来把这些地方的农民赶走。
    消息又说，但是那里的冲突仍继续发生。被逐出去的农民进入山区，他们不时对正在修建的军事设施进行武装袭击。
    消息说，巴基斯坦“黎明报”4月4日承认，在巴特赫尔，农民和巴基斯坦当局之间由于土地问题最近发生了武装冲突，一些人受了伤。
    消息说，同样的冲突发生在白沙瓦以南四十五公里的古尔古里。美国人企图在那里修建一个飞机场。据说当地的人民进行了武装抵抗，并且拒绝离开他们的土地，而他们现在仍然占有他们的土地。
    消息又说，在巴基斯坦的罕萨，当地人民拒绝对建筑公路的美国人提供任何帮助。
    “德里时代”周报说，上述事件表明，在巴基斯坦建立美国军事基地的措施是不得人心的。
