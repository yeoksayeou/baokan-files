Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan – Hubei Province has launched a massive fertilizer accumulation campaign. Various localities are seizing the current opportunity when wild grasses are abundant and aquatic plants are thriving, quickly launching a concentrated fertilizer accumulation campaign centered on cutting green manure to prepare sufficient fertilizer for summer planting. Huanggang Prefecture recently had more than 600,000 people per day going into the mountains and lakes to cut green manure and accumulate fertilizer.

Party committee secretaries at all levels taking the lead, participating in fertilizer accumulation, and leading fertilizer accumulation is a major feature of the current fertilizer accumulation movement in Hubei Province. Guan Jianchang, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Xinzhou County Party Committee, went deep into the Zhangjin Management Area of the Liji Commune to lead commune members in accumulating green manure, solving the fertilizer shortage problem for 610 mu of early rice fields. In order to ensure that low-yield fields and distant fields have sufficient fertilizer, field-side manure pits have been widely established in various places to cut artemisia, shovel sod, and accumulate fertilizer on the spot. Hongshan Commune in Sui County moved cattle pens near low-yield fields, grazing and making fertilizer simultaneously, which not only provided sufficient base fertilizer for low-yield fields, but also reduced the labor involved in transporting fertilizer back and forth.

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang – Guizhou Province is widely promoting the Xun Tu (smoked soil) fertilizer production experience of Jianhe County. Various localities have unanimously proposed that all vacant land should be smoked with fire before transplanting rice seedlings and sowing seeds, and that sufficient weeds should be prepared for summer-harvested crop land in order to smoke the soil and accumulate fertilizer in preparation for summer planting. In order to improve work efficiency, many innovative tools have been used in this movement. You often encounter such scenes: no one is seen, but bundles of weeds are flying down along the slide wires and slopes. To date, nearly four million mu of farmland has been smoked in the province. The Qian Dongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, which started earlier, has smoked 700,000 mu of farmland and prepared a large amount of weeds for summer-harvested crop land.

Smoking soil to accumulate fertilizer is a traditional experience in agricultural production. In 1959, Jianhe County combined deep plowing and close planting with smoking the soil to accumulate fertilizer, and achieved a bumper harvest of rice. The Guizhou Provincial Party Committee believes that this experience is of great significance to Guizhou, which has many mountains and abundant grass. According to investigations, compacted soil can be transformed into well-ventilated and permeable soil after being smoked. In addition to directly increasing nitrogen fertilizer in the soil, smoking also increases the soil temperature, which can promote the decomposition of phosphorus and potassium in the soil into easily absorbed nutrients. Smoking can also reduce pests and diseases and weeds in the field. These three major benefits provide crops with superior growing conditions, resulting in a significant increase in production. Last year, the 120,000 mu of rice fields in Jianhe County that were smoked produced 40% more per mu than ordinary rice fields. Therefore, the Provincial Party Committee called on all regions in the province with suitable conditions to earnestly promote this experience.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing – Suzhou Prefecture, Jiangsu Province, seized the favorable opportunity between the end of spring sowing and the beginning of summer planting to launch a concentrated fertilizer accumulation and production campaign. As of early May, the area had accumulated a large amount of refined fertilizer, nearly doubling the amount of refined fertilizer used for summer planting last year.

As soon as the sowing of middle-season rice ended in Jiangyin County, the labor force for accumulating fertilizer was increased to concentrate on cutting green grass and sod. Wangzhuang Commune in Changshu County divided into four routes to concentrate on accumulating fertilizer: one route dug river mud, one route cut green grass, one route made chemical fertilizer, and one route turned over the pond to compost fertilizer. Various localities made use of the rising temperature to vigorously compost grass pond mud. Suzhou Prefecture generally turned the grass pond mud three times, combined green manure, pig manure ash, and river mud, striving for excellence and making it even better. Jiangyin County, through field-by-field and pond-by-pond inspections, found that the recently expanded grain crop fields and "ten-side" lands lacked fertilizer, and immediately drew some labor from production teams with faster fertilizer accumulation progress to support production teams with slower fertilizer accumulation based on the principle of equivalent exchange.

### 湖北·贵州  抓紧农事空隙积造肥料  江苏苏州专区组织劳力割青沤肥

    湖北·贵州
    抓紧农事空隙积造肥料
    江苏苏州专区组织劳力割青沤肥
    据新华社武汉电　湖北省掀起了规模巨大的积肥高潮。各地都抓紧当前野草丛生、水草旺盛的时机，迅速掀起了以打青为主的突击积肥运动，为夏种准备充足的肥料。黄冈专区最近每天有六十多万人上山下湖，打青积肥。
    各级党委书记挂帅，参加积肥、领导积肥，是湖北省当前积肥运动的一大特色。中共新洲县委书记处书记关健昌深入到李集公社张仅管理区，领导社员积青肥，解决了六百一十亩早稻田的缺肥问题。为了使低产田、远田有足够的肥料，各地普遍在远田里建立了田头粪垱，就地打青蒿、铲草皮，就地积造肥料。随县洪山公社把牛栏搬到低产田附近，边放牧、边制肥，既为低产田备足了底肥，又减少了往返送肥的劳力。
    据新华社贵阳电　贵州省普遍推广剑河县熏土造肥经验。各地一致提出，要在插秧播种以前把所有的空闲土地火熏一遍，还要给夏收作物土地准备充分杂草，以便熏土积肥，准备夏种。为了提高工效，许多革新工具都在这个运动中运用起来了。常常碰到这样的情景：不见人迹，但见一捆捆杂草顺着滑丝、坡道腾空而下。到目前止，全省已熏田土近四百万亩。动手较早的黔东南苗族侗族自治州已熏田土七十万亩，并为夏收作物田土准备了大量杂草。
    熏土积肥，是农业生产上的一项传统经验。剑河县在1959年结合深耕、密植，进行熏土积肥，取得了水稻的特大丰收。中共贵州省委认为这一经验对山多草多的贵州有其重要意义。据调查，板结土壤经过烟熏能变成通风、透水的良好土壤。熏烟除直接增加土壤中的氮肥外，由于地温升高，还能促进土壤中的磷、钾分解，变成容易被吸收的养料。熏烟还能减少病虫害与田间杂草。这三大好处，给作物提供了优越的生长条件，因而起到显著的增产作用。剑河县去年用烟熏过的十二万亩稻田，比一般稻田亩产增长四成。因此，省委号召全省有条件的地区，都要切实推广这一经验。
    据新华社南京电　江苏省苏州专区抓住春播结束夏种尚末开始的有利时机，掀起积肥造肥突击运动。截至5月上旬为止，全区已积大量精肥，比去年夏种精肥增加近一倍。
    江阴县中稻播种一结束，就增加积肥劳动力，突击割青草、草皮。常熟县王庄公社分四路突击积肥，一路挖河泥，一路割青草，一路制化肥，一路翻潭沤肥。各地利用气温上升的时机，大沤草塘泥。苏州专区草塘泥普遍做到翻潭三次，绿肥、猪灰、河泥三搭配，精益求精，好上加好。江阴县通过逐丘逐潭检查，发现最近扩大的粮食作物田和“十边”地肥料不足，立即在积肥进度快的生产队中抽出一部分劳动力，以等价交换的原则，支援积肥慢的生产队。
