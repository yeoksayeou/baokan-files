Xinhua News Agency, May 18th, Jakarta News: Following the statements made by the spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia regarding the armed hijacking of the "Da Bao Kang" ship sent by China to transport overseas Chinese and the house arrest of the Chinese Consul in Macassar, Indonesian government officials have recently made a series of statements defending these incidents and extensively attacking the Chinese Embassy and Consul.

Suwito, Secretary-General of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, made a statement to the press on the 14th, defending the unreasonable house arrest of Jiang Yan, the Chinese Consul in Macassar, East Kalimantan Province, and falsely accusing the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia of making inappropriate protests against this violation of international norms.

Suwito admitted that the military authorities in Samarinda had indeed placed Chinese Consul Jiang Yan under house arrest and obstructed him from performing his normal consular duties. He insisted that it was "necessary for the military authorities to let Consul (Jiang Yan) stay temporarily in his residence and not allow him to contact overseas Chinese." He characterized the Chinese Embassy's protest against this serious incident that violated international norms and infringed on the personal freedom of the Chinese Consul as "rudely making accusations against senior Indonesian officials based on biased conclusions" and described the statement issued by the Chinese Embassy as "anti-Indonesian propaganda."

In order to shirk the obvious responsibility for the incident of forcibly placing the Chinese Consul under house arrest, he tried his best to slander Consul Jiang Yan in his speech. He insisted that "the activities and remarks of this Chinese diplomatic official were very inappropriate and not what a consul of a country maintaining friendly relations with Indonesia should have when dealing with Indonesian military and political officials there." He also insisted that Consul Jiang Yan "has been trying to use his activities to prevent the authorities from carrying out their work and implementing the central government's instructions on the repatriation of overseas Chinese."

He also cited what he called "normal diplomatic procedures" to accuse the Chinese Embassy, insisting that the embassy's statement to explain the truth was not in accordance with "normal diplomatic procedures." However, he did not explain what "normal diplomatic procedures" the Indonesian military authorities in Samarinda based their forcible house arrest of the Chinese Consul on.

According to a report by the Indonesian News Agency, on the same day, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Ministry of Information also made a statement, falsely accusing the Chinese Consul of "insulting" the Samarinda prosecutor and threatening to declare "relevant Chinese diplomatic officials as persona non grata."

He also defamed officials of the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia for being often "nervous and unable to control themselves" in the work of sending overseas Chinese, and also said that this was "encouraged by the propaganda of Radio Beijing." He then attacked Radio Beijing for "repeatedly uglifying the Indonesian government's measures."

Subsequently, Suska, Director of the Asian and Pacific Department of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, made another statement to the press on the 15th, defending the unreasonable detention of the "Da Bao Kang" ship sent by the Chinese government to transport overseas Chinese by the local military and police in Selat Panjang, Riau Province, on April 15, and extensively attacking the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia. He made this statement after leading a special investigation team to Selat Panjang for a sixteen-day on-the-spot investigation.

However, Suska also had to admit: "This ship did depart from Selat Panjang with the permission of the county head after the overseas Chinese boarded." This statement directly negated the lies fabricated by Indonesian Attorney General Goenawan before. Goenawan had insisted that the ship "escaped Indonesian territorial waters without permission."

Suska also admitted that the military and police in Selat Panjang had hijacked the "Da Bao Kang" ship. He said: "The prosecutorial authorities and the police authorities ordered the ship to return to Selat Panjang."

However, he again described the Chinese Embassy's statement pointing out these facts as "issuing biased accusations" against Indonesia.

When this Indonesian Foreign Ministry official quibbled about the hijacking of the "Da Bao Kang" ship, he said that the authorities in Selat Panjang suddenly dispatched armed police to hijack the ship after allowing it to set sail because "the overseas Chinese had not completed the necessary procedures." He even reversed right and wrong and said that the incident occurred "after diplomatic officials of the People's Republic of China came there to interfere with these procedures." But the fact is that the representative of the Governor of Riau Province and the local Director of the Foreign Affairs Bureau had said that all procedures had been completed.

    印度尼西亚官员大肆攻击我国
    竟说三马林达当局软禁我国领事是“必要的”，我国大使馆说明事实真相的声明不合乎“正常的外交程序”，并威胁要宣布我国有关外交官员为“不受欢迎的人”。
    承认“大宝康号”轮船是在当地县长许可下启程的，但又颠倒是非为劫持“大宝康号”轮船的非法行动辩护，并说我国外交部的声明是“抱有偏见的指责”。
    新华社18日讯　雅加达消息：在中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆发言人先后就中国派往接运华侨的“大宝康号”轮船遭武力劫持和中国驻马辰领事遭软禁事件发表声明后，印度尼西亚政府官员最近连续发表谈话，为这些事件辩解，并大肆攻击中国大使馆和领事。
    印度尼西亚外交部秘书长苏维托14日向报界发表谈话，为东加里曼丹省三马林达当局无理软禁中国驻马辰领事江燕事件辩解，并且反诬中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆对这种违反国际准则的事件提出抗议是
  “不适当的”。
    苏维托承认，三马林达军事当局曾经软禁了中国领事江燕并且阻挠他执行领事正常职务。他硬说军事当局“让（江燕）领事暂时呆在他的住所并且不让他同华侨联系是必要的。”而把中国大使馆对这种违反国际准则、侵犯中国领事人身自由的严重事件提出抗议，说成是“粗暴地根据有偏见的结论对印度尼西亚高级官员提出指责”，把中国大使馆就此发表的声明说成是“反印度尼西亚的宣传”。
    他为了推脱强行软禁中国领事事件的明显责任，在谈话中竭力诋毁江燕领事。他硬说，“这个中国外交官员的活动和言论是非常不适当的，不是同印度尼西亚保持友好关系的一个国家的一个领事在同那里的印度尼西亚军政官员打交道时所应当有的。”他还硬说江燕领事
  “一直以他的活动设法阻止当局进行他们的工作和执行中央政府关于遣返华侨的指示”。
    他还援引他所谓的“正常的外交程序”来指责中国大使馆，硬说大使馆为说明事实真相而发表声明是不合乎“正常的外交程序”的。但是他没有说明，印度尼西亚三马林达军事当局强行软禁中国领事是根据什么样的“正常的外交程序”。
    据印度尼西亚新闻社报道，在同一天，印度尼西亚情报部发言人也发表谈话，反诬中国领事“侮辱”三马林达检察官，并威胁要宣布中国“有关的外交官员为不受欢迎的人”。
    他还诽谤中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆官员在遣送华侨工作中常常“神经质而不能控制自己”，并且还说这是“受了北京电台宣传的鼓励”。他接着又攻击北京电台“一再丑化印度尼西亚政府的措施”。
    接着，印度尼西亚外交部亚洲和太平洋司司长苏斯卡15日又对报界发表谈话，为廖内省实叻班让当地军警4月15日无理扣留中国政府派往接运华侨的“大宝康号”轮船事件辩解，并且大肆攻击中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆。他是在率领一个专门调查小组到实叻班让进行实地调查十六天之后发表这个谈话的。
    但是苏斯卡也不得不承认：“这艘船只在华侨上船之后的确是在县长的许可下自实叻班让启程的”。他这番话直接否定了印度尼西亚最高检察长贡纳万在这以前所捏造的谎言。贡纳万曾一口咬定说这艘轮船是“未经许可擅自逃出印度尼西亚领海的”。
    苏斯卡也承认实叻班让军警曾经劫持“大宝康号”轮船。他说：“检察当局和警察当局曾经命令该船回到实叻班让”。
    但是他又把中国大使馆指出这些事实真相的声明说成是对印度尼西亚“发出抱有偏见的指责”。
    这位印度尼西亚外交部官员为劫持“大宝康号”轮船事件诡辩时说，实叻班让当局在允许那艘轮船开航之后又突然派遣武装警察去劫持，是因为“华侨还没有办完必要的手续”。他甚至颠倒是非地说，这一事件的发生“是在中华人民共和国外交官员来到那里干预这些手续以后发生的。”但是事实是，廖内省长的代表和当地外侨管理局局长都说过一切手续已经办理完毕。
