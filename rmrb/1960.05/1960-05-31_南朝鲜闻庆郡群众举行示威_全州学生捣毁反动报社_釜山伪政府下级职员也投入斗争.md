Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 29th -- Seoul Dispatch: Students, citizens, and merchants in various parts of South Korea continue their unyielding struggle against the fascist rule of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs.

　　In Gyeongsangbuk-do Province, more than 1,000 people in Jeomchon-eup, Munkyung County, staged a demonstration on the 28th, protesting against the officials of the Heo Jeong puppet government. Demonstrating citizens and students chanted slogans such as "Get out, you corrupt officials who participated in the illegal March 15th election!" and distributed leaflets.

　　According to a report by the Hapdong News Agency, more than 50 students from Jeonbuk University in Jeonju, Jeollabuk-do Province, attacked the Jeonju branch of the "United News" on the 28th, demolishing the newspaper's building. This was because "United News" slandered the students' just struggle during their fight against the pro-government president and shielded the president who colluded with the Syngman Rhee group.

　　According to a report by Seoul Radio Station, students from Hanyang High School in Seoul dispatched 30 representatives to the Seoul puppet education authorities on the 28th, demanding that the school's "Chairman of the Board of Trustees" and "Principal" immediately step down. It is reported that students at this school began a struggle a month ago to expel the "Principal" who colluded with the Syngman Rhee group and suppressed the students' democracy and freedom, and have stubbornly persisted until now.

　　Lower-level employees within the Heo Jeong puppet government have also recently launched a struggle against the authorities' illegal measures. According to a broadcast by Busan Radio Station, more than 200 employees in the Jung-gu puppet government in Busan staged a demonstration on the 28th, storming the office of the Busan puppet mayor to protest against the protection and promotion of corrupt bureaucrats. The panic-stricken puppet mayor quickly fled, and the demonstrating employees organized a struggle committee and launched a sit-in in the Jung-gu puppet government. It is reported that when the people of Busan demanded the punishment of corrupt bureaucrats who participated in the "March 15th" puppet presidential election, the puppet mayor only transferred the high-ranking officials criticized by the people, and some were even promoted.

　　Merchants in Busan also continue their struggle. Busan Radio Station said that more than 500 merchants from the Busan Public Market held a demonstration on the 20th, demanding guarantees for their normal business operations. The merchants held signs and staged a sit-in at the Busan puppet city government.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 30th -- Seoul Dispatch: The people of South Korea are building on their successes and further launching a struggle against the fascist rule of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs.

　　Today, more than 2,500 young people and women in Busan held a demonstration. They shouted slogans such as "Abolish exorbitant taxes and levies!" "Expel corrupt officials!" and so on.

　　According to a report by the Hapdong News Agency, more than 100 unemployed people in Seoul also staged a demonstration this afternoon. These demonstrators gathered in Tapgol Park and marched to the front of the puppet "Police Agency," demanding "punishment for the masterminds of the illegal election of March 15th (i.e., the puppet 'presidential election' this year)."

    南朝鲜闻庆郡群众举行示威
    全州学生捣毁反动报社　釜山伪政府下级职员也投入斗争
    新华社平壤29日电　汉城消息：南朝鲜各地学生、市民和商人继续为反对美帝国主义及其走狗的法西斯统治进行着不屈不挠的斗争。
    庆尚北道闻庆郡店村邑在28日爆发了一千多人的示威，反对许政傀儡政府的官吏。示威的市民和学生高呼“参加三·一五非法选举的恶霸官吏滚出去”等口号，并散发传单。
    据合同通讯社报道，全罗北道全州市全北大学的五十多名学生28日袭击了替反动派说话的“联合新闻”社全州分社，捣毁了这家报社的建筑物。因为“联合新闻”在学生进行反对御用校长的斗争时，诽谤了学生的正义斗争，并且庇护勾结李承晚集团的校长。
    据汉城广播电台报道，汉城市汉阳高等学校的学生28日又派出三十名代表到汉城市伪教育当局，要求这个学校的“财团理事长”兼“校长”立即下台。据报道，这个学校的学生从一个月以前就开始了驱逐勾结李承晚集团、压制学生的民主和自由的“校长”出校的斗争，一直顽强地坚持到现在。
    许政傀儡政府内部的下级职员最近也展开了反对当局的非法措施的斗争。据釜山广播电台广播，釜山市中区伪政府中的二百多名职员28日举行示威，冲进釜山市伪市长的办公室，对庇护和重用恶霸官僚的行为提出抗议。惊惶失措的伪市长赶紧逃跑了，示威的职员们组织了斗争委员会，并且在中区伪政府中展开静坐斗争。据报道，在釜山人民要求惩办参加“三·一五”伪总统选举的恶霸官僚时，伪市长只把受到人民指责的高级官僚调动了一下，有的还被提升了。
    釜山市的商人也继续展开斗争。釜山广播电台说，釜山公设市场的五百多名商人20日举行示威要求保障他们的正常营业。商人们举着标语牌到釜山市伪市政府进行了静坐示威。
    据新华社平壤30日电　汉城消息：南朝鲜人民再接再厉，进一步展开了反对美帝国主义及其走狗的法西斯统治的斗争。
    今天，釜山二千五百多名青少年和妇女举行了示威。他们高呼“取消苛捐杂税！”“驱逐恶霸吏！”等口号。
    据合同通讯社报道，今天下午，汉城市也有一百多名失业者举行示威。这些示威者在塔洞公园集合起来后，一直冲到伪“警察厅”门前，要求“惩办三·一五（即今年3月15日伪“总统选举”）不法选举的元凶”。
