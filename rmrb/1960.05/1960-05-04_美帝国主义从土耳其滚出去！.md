Today is the 41st anniversary of the May Fourth Movement. Forty-one years ago, a great anti-imperialist and anti-feudal mass movement of great historical significance in modern Chinese revolutionary history broke out in Beijing. At that time, students in Beijing held a large-scale demonstration in front of Tiananmen Square to oppose imperialist aggression and the treasonous crimes of feudal warlords, shouting slogans such as "Strive for national sovereignty abroad, punish traitors at home." This large-scale demonstration quickly received responses from all over the country. Under the influence of Chinese Marxists, the Chinese working class appeared on the political stage for the first time as a conscious class. Workers in Shanghai, Tangshan, Changxindian and other places held large-scale political strikes. The anti-imperialist and anti-feudal mass movement quickly surged, and the Chinese revolution entered a new stage - the stage of the new democratic revolution. Over the past few decades, the Chinese working class, under the leadership of its vanguard, the Communist Party of China, has united the people of the whole country and has victoriously overthrown the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in China, and after completing the new democratic revolution, it has carried out the socialist revolution and is now striving to build China into a great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture.

Today, as we commemorate the 41st anniversary of the May Fourth Movement, we see that the situation in many parts of the world is very similar to that of old China forty-one years ago. On the one hand, imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism, is carrying out ruthless enslavement and plunder of many countries. They support a small handful of reactionaries within these countries and implement barbaric fascist rule over the masses of people. On the other hand, the broad masses of people in these countries, for the sake of national independence and democratic freedom, and even in order to survive, have no choice but to rise up and carry out heroic struggles against imperialism and its running dogs. The slogan "Strive for national sovereignty abroad, punish traitors at home" shouted by Beijing students forty-one years ago is still of great practical significance to the youth and people of many countries.

Recently, we have seen volcanoes erupting one after another under the feet of U.S. imperialism. After the youth of South Korea lit the torch of struggle against the U.S.-Syngman Rhee clique, the youth of Turkey also bravely rose up to oppose the dictatorial government supported by the United States. Tens of thousands of students in Istanbul first held a large demonstration on April 28, demanding the dictator Menderes step down. The reactionary government carried out bloody suppression of the demonstrators, but did not frighten the people, but aroused even stronger anger. The anger quickly spread to the capital Ankara and other cities, forming a powerful patriotic struggle wave, powerfully impacting the rule of the United States and its running dogs in Turkey.

The outbreak of the Turkish people's large-scale demonstration is because they have been unable to tolerate the reactionary policies of Menderes's traitorous dictatorial government, because they have reached the point where they cannot survive under the current situation. The Menderes government was fostered and strongly supported by U.S. imperialism. This government has for many years been implementing a traitorous policy of selling out national interests, turning Turkey into a dependency of the United States, and plunging 27 million people into misery. U.S. imperialism has always regarded the Menderes government as an important tool for promoting its expansionist, aggressive and war policies, especially as a springboard for attacking the socialist camp and a gENDARME for suppressing the national independence movement in the Middle East. The United States has established many military bases in Turkey, and has 15,000 troops stationed there, committing all kinds of evil. The bilateral military treaty signed between the United States and Turkey last March guaranteed that the United States could send its troops into Turkey at any time according to "need". Using Turkey as a base, the U.S. armed forces have carried out activities of military threat and aggression against Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq, and the Menderes clique has always been assigned the shameful role of accomplice. In order to support a small handful of reactionaries in Turkey, U.S. imperialism has given them a total of 3 billion U.S. dollars in "aid" through the "Truman Doctrine", the "Marshall Plan", the "Point Four Program" and the "Eisenhower Doctrine". None of this has brought any benefit to the Turkish people. In order to adapt to the needs of U.S. imperialism's aggressive war policy, the Menderes government maintains an armed force of 600,000 people, with 60% of the annual budget used for military expenditures. Due to the huge military expenditure, it has caused a serious financial deficit, and the national debt has reached a huge figure equivalent to 55% of the national income. The domestic industry has been devastated by U.S. dumping, a large number of enterprises have closed down, the operating rate of many factories is less than 40%, the number of unemployed has reached more than 400,000, and prices have continued to rise, with the cost of living rising fivefold since 1950. In order to suppress the resistance of the masses, the Menderes government has implemented an extremely barbaric fascist rule, depriving the masses of any democratic freedom, throwing thousands of patriots into prison, and even prohibiting opposition parties from campaigning in the general election. Eisenhower, who visited Turkey not long ago, praised such a treacherous and barbaric government as a "modern testing ground," "an inspiration and beacon for all newly independent countries determined to seek progress, prosperity, and peace." This can only show that in the mouths of U.S. imperialists, barbarism is "progress," economic crisis is "prosperity," and arms expansion and war preparations are "peace." But all this can never deceive the youth and people of Turkey. If there is anything that can be said to be an "inspiration," it is to inspire the youth and people of Turkey to rise up and overthrow the traitorous and dictatorial Menderes government. Now the Turkish youth have raised the banner of justice for independence, democracy, and freedom, demanding the overthrow of the Menderes clique's rule and demanding an end to the disastrous policies imposed on them by the United States. Youth are the vanguard of the people, and the just struggle of the Turkish youth reflects the deep hatred of the Turkish people for the American aggressors and their running dogs, reflects the rapid development of the national democratic movement sweeping Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and it shows that no force can stop this great historical trend.

The situation in Turkey powerfully shows that in order to realize its wild ambition to dominate the world, U.S. imperialism is doing its utmost to search for and keep a small handful of the most reactionary national scum in various countries, and support them in order to make it easier for U.S. imperialism to infringe upon the sovereignty and national interests of these countries and turn these countries into its "free world" to do whatever it wants. At present, all the most decadent forces, reactionary dictators, such as Syngman Rhee and Huh Jung in South Korea, Menderes in Turkey, Ngo Dinh Diem in South Vietnam, Nobusuke Kishi in Japan, Franco in Spain, Trujillo in the Dominican Republic, Somoza in Nicaragua, and Batista and Jimenez, who have been overthrown by the people, are all running dogs kept and obeying the United States. They rely on American bayonets to implement dark rule and ruthlessly suppress the people. All this directly damages the fundamental interests of the people of these countries and brings endless disasters to these countries. Chiang Kai-shek in Taiwan, China, is also one of these running dogs kept by the United States. Facts have proved that U.S. imperialism has long become the most reactionary center in the world and the supporter of all decadent forces. It is the most ferocious enemy of all oppressed nations and oppressed peoples.

The United States has always wanted to conceal this sinful behavior of being an enemy of the people of all countries, touting the national scum it keeps, such as Syngman Rhee, Chiang Kai-shek, Ngo Dinh Diem, and Menderes, as "great patriots" and "freedom fighters," and calling the dark hells under their dictatorial rule "democratic showcases" and "testing grounds" of freedom, or trying to cover up the master-slave relationship between it and the notorious dictators and traitors. U.S. President Eisenhower, for example, recently declared in a serious manner: "Some say that the United States supports dictators, which is ridiculous. Surely no country loves freedom more than the United States." Eisenhower thought that he could get away with it so neatly. However, the heroic struggle of the South Korean people against the Syngman Rhee clique slapped Eisenhower in the face, and now the Turkish people's large-scale demonstration against Menderes has slapped Eisenhower in the face again. If the United States really loves "freedom" the most, then why does it do its utmost to support all the most corrupt, most barbaric, and most autocratic handful of reactionaries? Is this the kind of "freedom" that Eisenhower and his gang of imperialists are talking about?

The Turkish example also most powerfully exposes the lie of American aid. What has American "aid" brought? It is nothing more than heavy military spending burdens, astronomical national debts, crises in the national economy, inflation, soaring unemployment, and extreme hardship in the lives of the people. The current situation in Turkey is a true reflection. Eisenhower even had the audacity to say when he visited Turkey last year that Turkey was an "enlightening example" of progress and prosperity under American aid, and a "beacon" for all newly independent countries. But the undeniable fact is that the Turkish people have reached the point where they can no longer tolerate the pain and disaster created for them by the United States and its running dogs, and they have risen up to carry out heroic resistance. This is indeed an educational "inspiration" and "beacon" for all those who have not yet seen the harmful essence of "American aid."

All rhetoric and deceptive tricks cannot cover up the aggressive face of U.S. imperialism. The people of all countries recognize the root cause of their pain and disaster from their own experiences, and are increasingly raising their awareness. The roar of the South Korean people first aroused resonance among the Turkish people, which is particularly significant. Everyone knows that Turkey and South Korea are both "allies" that U.S. imperialism considers the most loyal and reliable. The United States has invested the most in them and has the strictest control over them. The United States not only has bases scattered all over Turkey and a large number of troops stationed there, but also American "experts" and "advisers" have infiltrated almost every political, economic, and military department in Turkey, tightly controlling every vein of Turkey. U.S. imperialism and the Turkish reactionaries obviously believe that they can firmly ride on the heads of the Turkish people in this way. After the overthrow of the Faisal dynasty in Iraq, the United States decided to move the headquarters of the Middle East aggression group to Ankara, precisely because it believed that Turkey was the most "reliable" place? When U.S. President Eisenhower visited Turkey last year, didn't he enthusiastically praise the "political stability" of this "sister republic"? But facts have proved that no matter how strong the American-made chains are, they cannot lock the hands of the people's resistance. The more reactionary the rule, the more it can only promote the people's awareness and stimulate the people's will to struggle. Now, the Turkish people have taken action, and the Menderes dictatorial government's attempt to use crazy suppression to extinguish the flames of the people's struggle is obviously futile. Since in places like South Korea and Turkey, U.S. imperialism and its running dogs cannot prevent the outbreak of the people's anger, then in the "free world" controlled by U.S. imperialism, is there any place that is its "land of happiness"? The "showcases" of the "free world" have really turned into a pile of broken glass, as the British newspapers have ridiculed. In today's era of increasing awakening of the people, the volcanoes under the feet of U.S. imperialism will inevitably erupt one after another like a chain reaction. Washington is already panicking about this unfavorable situation. The United States replaced Syngman Rhee with Syngman Rhee's henchman Huh Jung in South Korea, and may take similar deceptive measures in Turkey. But as long as the U.S. aggressive forces do not leave, the invaded countries will not be able to gain freedom for a single day. The trick of replacing old puppets with new puppets cannot deceive the youth and people of all countries who are fighting for freedom.

There is no doubt that the patriotic struggle of the Turkish people is supported by all just people in the world. This is not only because the Turkish people are fighting for independence, democracy, and freedom, but also because the struggle of the Turkish people, like the liberation struggles of the people of all countries, plays a role in preventing the imperialists headed by the United States from launching aggressive wars. Every victory achieved by the Turkish people inevitably strikes a blow at the aggressive war plans of U.S. imperialism. Therefore, firmly supporting the struggle of the Turkish people is also effectively defending world peace. At the end of April, the Chinese people held mass rallies and demonstrations across the country to support the patriotic and just struggle of the South Korean people. Today, as we commemorate the 41st anniversary of the May Fourth Movement, the Chinese people are holding large-scale rallies and demonstrations to support the Turkish people who are persisting in the struggle against the United States and its running dogs, and resolutely oppose U.S. imperialism and its running dogs enslaving and massacring the patriotic people of Turkey. The victorious Chinese people have always regarded firmly supporting the just struggle of the people of all countries for liberation, and firmly supporting the national democratic movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, as their lofty international obligation. The Chinese people always stand unswervingly on the side of the people of all countries, on the side of opposing the aggressive and war policies of U.S. imperialism, and on the side of defending the struggle for peace. We believe that just as the Chinese people who shouted "Strive for national sovereignty abroad, punish traitors at home" forty-one years ago have achieved victory, the people of South Korea, Turkey, and all those under the aggression and oppression of U.S. imperialism, despite the arduous and tortuous struggle they still have to undergo, will surely achieve final victory. All people who are subjected to the aggression and oppression of U.S. imperialism, unite to oppose the aggressive and war policies of U.S imperialism! U.S. imperialism get out of Turkey, get out of South Korea, get out South Vietnam, get out of Japan, get out of the Philippines, get out of Taiwan our territory!

### 美帝国主义从土耳其滚出去！

    美帝国主义从土耳其滚出去！
    今天是“五四”运动四十一周年纪念日。四十一年前，在北京爆发了在中国近代革命史上有伟大历史意义的反帝反封建的群众运动。当时北京的学生，为反对帝国主义的侵略和封建军阀的卖国罪行，在天安门前举行了大示威，高呼“外争国权、内惩国贼”等口号。这次大示威迅速得到全国各地的响应。中国工人阶级在中国的马克思主义者的影响下，第一次作为一个自觉的阶级出现在政治舞台上，上海、唐山、长辛店等地工人举行了大规模的政治罢工。反帝反封建的群众运动迅速高涨，中国革命从此进入一个新的阶段——新民主主义革命阶段。几十年来，中国工人阶级在它的先锋队中国共产党的领导下，团结全国人民，已经胜利地打倒了帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义在中国的统治，并且在完成了新民主主义革命之后又进行了社会主义革命，现在正在为把中国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家而奋斗。
    今天，当我们纪念“五四”运动四十一周年的时候，我们看到，世界上还有许多地方的情况同四十一年前的旧中国十分类似。一方面，帝国主义特别是美帝国主义对许多国家实行穷凶极恶的奴役和掠夺，他们扶植这些国家内的一小撮反动派，对人民群众实行野蛮的法西斯统治。另一方面，这些国家的广大人民群众，为了民族独立和民主自由，甚至为了要生活下去，不得不起来对帝国主义和它的走狗进行英勇的斗争。四十一年前北京学生喊出的“外争国权、内惩国贼”的口号，对于许多国家的青年和人民仍然具有十分现实的意义。
    最近我们看到，美帝国主义脚下的一座又一座的火山相继爆发了。在南朝鲜青年燃起了反对美李集团的斗争火炬之后，土耳其青年也英勇地起来反对美国支持的独裁政府。伊斯坦布尔成万的学生于4月28日首先举行了大示威，要求独裁者曼德列斯下台。反动政府对示威群众进行血腥的镇压，但是并没有把人民吓倒，反而激起了更强烈的愤怒。怒火很快就蔓延到首都安卡拉和其他城市，形成一个声势浩大的爱国斗争浪潮，有力地冲击着美国及其走狗在土耳其的统治。
    土耳其人民大示威的爆发，是因为他们对于曼德列斯的卖国独裁政府的反动政策已忍无可忍，是因为他们在目前的状况下已到了活不下去的地步。曼德列斯政府是美帝国主义一手扶植和大力支持的，这个政府多年以来一直执行着出卖民族利益的卖国政策，把土耳其变成为美国的附庸国，而使两千七百万人民陷于水深火热之中。美帝国主义一向把曼德列斯政府看作是推行其扩张侵略和战争政策的重要工具，特别是作为进攻社会主义阵营的跳板和镇压中东民族独立运动的宪兵。美国在土耳其建立了许多军事基地，派有一万五千名的驻军，在那里无恶不作。去年3月美国同土耳其签订的双边军事条约，保证了美国得以根据“需要”随时把它的军队开进土耳其。美国武装部队以土耳其为基地，曾经对叙利亚、黎巴嫩、伊拉克进行武力威胁和军事侵略的活动，而曼德列斯集团总是被派定充当帮凶的可耻角色。美帝国主义为了扶植土耳其的一小撮反动派，曾经通过“杜鲁门主义”、“马歇尔计划”、“第四点计划”直到“艾森豪威尔主义”，给了他们前后共达三十亿美元的“援助”。这一切都没有为土耳其人民带来任何好处。曼德列斯政府为了适应美帝国主义的侵略战争政策的需要，维持着一支六十万人的武装部队，每年预算中有60％用于军事开支。由于军事开支庞大，造成了严重的财政赤字，国债达到了相当于国民收入55％的巨大数字。而本国工业则受到美国倾销的摧残，大批企业倒闭，许多工厂的开工率不到40％，失业人数已达到四十多万，物价不断上涨，从1950年以来生活费用就上涨了五倍。曼德列斯政府为了镇压人民群众的反抗，实行极端野蛮的法西斯统治，剥夺了人民群众的任何一点民主自由，把成千上万的爱国者投入狱中，甚至在大选中也禁止反对党进行竞选活动。对于这样一个卖国求荣、野蛮透顶的政府，艾森豪威尔不久前访问土耳其时竟然称赞它是一个“现代的试验场”，“对决心谋求进步、繁荣及和平的一切新独立的国家说来是一种启发和灯塔”。这只能说明，在美帝国主义口中，野蛮就是“进步”，经济危机就是“繁荣”，扩军备战就是“和平”。但是这一切决不能欺骗土耳其的青年和人民。如果可以说有什么“启发”的话，那就是启发土耳其青年和人民起来推翻卖国独裁的曼德列斯政府。现在土耳其青年已高举起争取独立、民主、自由的义旗，要求推翻曼德列斯集团的统治，要求结束美国强加在他们身上的灾难政策。青年是人民的急先锋，土耳其青年的正义斗争，反映出了土耳其人民对于美国侵略者及其走狗的深仇大恨，反映出了席卷着亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族民主运动的迅速发展，它表明了任何力量都无法阻挡这伟大的历史潮流。
    土耳其的情况有力地表明，美帝国主义为了实现它狂妄地独霸世界的野心，竭力在世界各国搜罗和豢养一小撮最反动的民族败类，加以扶植，以便于美帝国主义得心应手地侵犯这些国家的主权和民族利益，把这些国家变成为它为所欲为的“自由世界”。目前，世界上一切最腐朽的力量，反动独裁分子，像南朝鲜的李承晚、许政，土耳其的曼德列斯，南越的吴庭艳，日本的岸信介，西班牙的佛朗哥，多米尼加的特鲁希略，尼加拉瓜的索摩查，以及已经被人民推翻了的巴蒂斯塔、希门尼斯等等，都是这样为美国所豢养和听命于美国的走狗，他们靠了美国的刺刀实行黑暗统治，无情地镇压人民。这一切，都直接损害着这些国家人民的根本利益，为这些国家带来了无穷的祸害。中国台湾的蒋介石，也是美国所豢养的这批走狗中的一个。事实证明，美帝国主义久已成为全世界最反动的中心，成为一切腐朽力量的支持者。它是一切被压迫民族和被压迫人民的最凶恶的敌人。
    美国一直想掩饰它这种与各国人民为敌的罪恶行为，把它所豢养的民族败类如李承晚、蒋介石、吴庭艳、曼德列斯之流吹捧为“伟大的爱国者”、“自由战士”，把在他们独裁统治下的黑暗地狱称为“民主橱窗”、自由的“试验场”，或者力图掩盖它和臭名昭著的独裁者、卖国贼之间的主奴关系。像美国总统艾森豪威尔不久以前就曾公然煞有介事地宣称：“有人说美国支持独裁者，这是荒唐可笑的。肯定说，没有任何国家比美国更爱自由”。艾森豪威尔自以为这样就可以推脱得干净俐落。但是，南朝鲜人民反对李承晚集团的英勇斗争，给了艾森豪威尔一记耳光，现在土耳其人民反对曼德列斯的大示威又打了艾森豪威尔的嘴巴。如果美国真的最爱“自由”，那末为什么它所竭力支持的尽是那些最腐朽、最野蛮、最专制的一小撮反动派呢？难道艾森豪威尔及其一伙帝国主义分子所说的“自由”就是这样一种“自由”吗？
    土耳其的例子也最有力地揭穿了美援的骗局。美国的“援助”究竟带来了什么呢？无非是沉重的军费负担、天文数字的国债、民族经济的危机、通货膨胀、失业激增、人民生活的极端困苦。土耳其的现状就是真实的写照。艾森豪威尔在去年访问土耳其的时候居然还厚颜无耻地说什么土耳其是在美国援助下实现进步和繁荣的一个“有启发性的例子”，是对一切新独立国家的“灯塔”。而千真万确的事实是，土耳其人民对于美国及其走狗给他们制造的痛苦和灾难已经到了不能再忍受的地步了，他们已经起来进行英勇的反抗了。这对于一切还没有看清“美援”的害人的实质的人们，倒的确是一个富有教育意义的“启发”和“灯塔”。
    一切花言巧语和欺骗诡计都掩盖不住美帝国主义的侵略面目。各国人民从自己的亲身感受中认识到什么是他们痛苦和灾难的根源，而日益提高他们的觉悟。南朝鲜人民的怒吼首先在土耳其人民当中激起了共鸣，这是特别有意义的。谁都知道土耳其和南朝鲜都是美帝国主义所认为最忠实可靠的“盟国”，美国在它们的身上投下的赌注最大，对它们的控制也最严。美国在土耳其不但设有星罗棋布的基地，派有大批的驻军，美国的“专家”和“顾问”渗入到土耳其几乎每一个政治、经济和军事部门，严密地控制着土耳其的每一根脉管。美帝国主义和土耳其的反动派显然认为，他们这样就可以稳稳地骑在土耳其人民的头上了。美国在伊拉克费萨尔王朝被推翻之后决定把中东侵略集团的总部迁到安卡拉，不正是因为认为土耳其是最“可靠”的地方吗？美国总统艾森豪威尔去年访问土耳其的时候，不是曾热烈夸赞这个“姊妹共和国”的“政治稳定”吗？但是事实证明，不管多么牢固的美制锁链，都锁不住人民反抗的双手，愈加反动的统治只能愈加促进人民的觉悟和激发人民的斗争意志。现在，土耳其人民行动起来了，曼德列斯独裁政府企图用疯狂镇压来扑灭人民的斗争火焰，这显然是徒然的。既然在南朝鲜和土耳其这样的地方，美帝国主义和它的走狗都无法阻止人民怒火的爆发，那末美帝国主义在它所控制的“自由世界”中，还有什么地方是它的“安乐土”呢？那些“自由世界”的“橱窗”，真的像英国的报纸所嘲笑的那样，已经变成一堆碎玻璃了。在今天这个人民日益觉醒的时代，美帝国主义脚下的火山必不可免地像连锁反应一样一个跟着一个爆发起来。华盛顿方面已经对于这种不妙的局势惶惶不安了。美国在南朝鲜用李承晚的帮凶许政来代替李承晚，在土耳其也可能采取类似的欺骗手法。但是美国侵略势力一日不去，被侵略国家一日不能得到自由。用新傀儡代替老傀儡的把戏是欺骗不了各国争取自由的青年和人民的。
    土耳其人民的爱国斗争毫无疑问得到全世界一切正义人民的支持。这不仅因为土耳其人民争取的是独立、民主、自由，而且因为土耳其人民的斗争也和各国人民的解放斗争一样，起着阻止以美国为首的帝国主义发动侵略战争的作用，土耳其人民所取得的每一个胜利，都不可避免地打击了美帝国主义的侵略战争计划。因此，坚决支持土耳其人民的斗争，也就是有效地捍卫世界和平。4月底，中国人民在全国各地举行了声援南朝鲜人民爱国正义斗争的群众大会和示威游行。今天，在纪念“五四”运动四十一周年的时候，中国人民又举行大规模的集会和示威，来声援正在坚持反对美国及其走狗的斗争的土耳其人民，坚决反对美帝国主义及其走狗奴役和屠杀土耳其爱国人民。胜利了的中国人民从来就把坚决支持世界各国人民争取解放的正义斗争，把坚决支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族民主运动，看成是自己崇高的国际义务。中国人民不论什么时候都坚定不移地站在各国人民一边，站在反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策的一边，站在保卫和平斗争的一边。我们相信，正如四十一年前发出“外争国权、内惩国贼”的吼声的中国人民已经取得了胜利一样，南朝鲜、土耳其和一切在美帝国主义侵略和压迫下的人民，尽管还要经历艰巨和曲折的斗争，但是一定能够达到最后胜利。一切遭受美帝国主义的侵略和压迫的人民，团结起来，反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策！美帝国主义从土耳其滚出去，从南朝鲜滚出去，从南越滚出去，从日本滚出去，从菲律宾滚出去，从我国领土台湾滚出去！
