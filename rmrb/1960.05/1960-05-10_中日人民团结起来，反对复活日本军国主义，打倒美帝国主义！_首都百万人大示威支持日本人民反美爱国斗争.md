Xinhua News Agency, May 9th: More than a million people from all walks of life in the capital held an unprecedented demonstration and rally today, resolutely supporting the Japanese people's just struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.

The powerful demonstration队伍 (duìwǔ, ranks, contingent), waving fists and flags, holding high banners, angrily shouted: "Oppose the revival of Japanese militarism!" "Down with U.S. imperialism!" The angry roars of more than a million people echoed the roars of the Japanese people who today began their sixteenth unified action against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.

Liao Chengzhi, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, solemnly announced at the meeting: The 650 million Chinese people always regard supporting the Japanese people's struggle as their sacred duty, and regard it as their own struggle. He firmly believes that with the support of the people of the world, the Japanese people will surely be able to smash the aggressive U.S.-Japan military alliance and completely expel the forces of U.S. imperialism from Japan.

Today, the entire city of Beijing was out in force. Starting at noon, demonstration crowds composed of workers, peasants, students, militiamen, People's Liberation Army soldiers, and citizens, shouting slogans, surged towards Tiananmen Square, forming an angry ocean. They lined up in neat formations, filling the entire square leading to the Qianmen Arrow Tower and the vast East and West Chang'an Avenues, stretching six li (approximately 3 kilometers). The steps of the Great Hall of the People and the Revolutionary Museum and the History Museum, as well as the railings of the Monument to the People's Heroes and the Jinshui Bridge, were also filled with people. Above the center of the square rose ten large balloons with huge banners. The roars of the people were like surging tides, one wave higher than the other.

Deng Xiaoping, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Peng Zhen, He Long, and Tan Zhenlin, members of the Political Bureau, Kang Sheng, alternate member, Wang Jiaxiang, Secretary of the Secretariat, Liu Lantao, alternate secretary, Luo Ruiqing and Xi Zhongxun, Vice Premiers of the State Council, Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, Huang Yanpei, Chen Shutong, Saifudin, Cheng Qian, and Lin Feng, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Li Siguang and Bao Erhan, Vice Chairmen of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Fu Zuoyi, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council, Liao Chengzhi, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, Liu Changsheng, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Li Dequan, Vice Chairman of the National Women's Federation, Luo Yi, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, and Liu Ren, Second Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, attended today's meeting.

All Japanese foreign guests in Beijing attended today's meeting, including the delegation of the Japan-China Friendship Association headed by Akatsu Masuzo, the delegation of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan headed by Hagiwara Shinji and Komori Masao, the Japanese medical delegation headed by Suda Shuhachiro, Takano Minoru, Vice Chairman of the All Japan Metal Workers Union, Japanese peace activist Saionji Kinkazu, and Japanese journalists Ito Takeo, among others.

Party and state leaders, heads of various departments of the government, people's organizations, democratic parties, and Beijing Municipality, as well as many foreign envoys and foreign guests, ascended the Tiananmen Gate.

At 3 p.m., the capital's people from all walks of life held a rally to support the Japanese people's opposition to the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.

The meeting was presided over by Guo Moruo.

In his speech, Guo Moruo once again expressed the Chinese people's firm support for the Japanese people. He said that the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic and just struggle has made a great contribution to the cause of defending Asian and world peace. All peace-loving people in the world stand with the Japanese people. There is no doubt that the U.S. imperialism that runs rampant in Japanese territory will be driven out. The like of Kishi Nobusuke, who follows U.S. imperialism in doing evil, will not have a better end than Syngman Rhee and Lee Ki-poong. Final victory will surely belong to the increasingly united Japanese people.

Amidst warm applause, Liao Chengzhi, a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, began his speech. He pointed out that the one who supports the revival of Japanese militarism is the most ferocious enemy of the people of the world today: U.S. imperialism. The forces of Japanese militarism, which carried out bloody massacres against the people of China and many Asian countries fifteen years ago, have today become a real threat to the people of Asian countries. The aggressive U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty is pointing its spearhead at China, the Soviet Union, and all Asian countries.

Liao Chengzhi solemnly warned the U.S.-Japan reactionaries: "Socialist China has the strength to crush any aggression. If U.S. imperialism and Japanese militarism dare to attack our country, they will surely be smashed to pieces."

He declared in the name of the entire Chinese people: "Any provocation by imperialism against the great Soviet Union, we regard as a provocation against the entire socialist camp."

Liao Chengzhi emphasized: "Whether it is U.S. imperialism or Japanese militarism, if they dare to launch a major war, they will surely be burned to ashes by the flames of war. The result will be the victory of socialism throughout the world and the demise of capitalism throughout the world."

In his speech, he warmly praised the Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and expressed his heartfelt respect to the heroic and unyielding Japanese people.

Liao Chengzhi's speech constantly aroused stormy applause from the million people in the square. People let out earth-shattering ro ars: "U.S. imperialism get out of Japan! Get out of South Korea! Get out from South Vietnam! Get out of Turkey! Get out of the Philippines! Get out of our territory Taiwan!" "Down with U.S. imperialism!" At this time, large balloons with huge banners flew into the sky one after another with the slogans.

Warm applause rang out in the square to welcome Akatsu Masuzo, head of the visiting delegation of the Japan-China Friendship Association, to speak. Akatsu Masuzo expressed his gratitude to the Chinese people for their support of the Japanese people's struggle. Akatsu Masuzo said that today's situation in Asia and Africa is at a new historical turning point. We firmly believe that in the world situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind, in the struggle against imperialism in order to achieve true peaceful coexistence in Asia, victory will surely belong to the people. He said that the Japanese people are determined to fight to the end to smash the U.S.-Japan military alliance.

Hagiwara Shinji, head of the visiting delegation of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, then spoke. When he announced, "The Japanese people will never fight the Chinese people again," a storm of applause erupted in the square. Hagiwara Shinji, on behalf of the Japanese working class, thanked the Chinese people for their support. He shouted: "Long live the unity and joint action of the workers of Japan and China!" At this time, the slogan resounded once again in the square: "The people of China and Japan unite to overthrow U.S. imperialism!"

Next, the heads of various people's organizations, democratic parties, and representatives from all walks of life spoke at the meeting in succession. They were: Liu Changsheng, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Luo Yi, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China, Li Dequan, Vice Chairman of the National Women's Federation, He Xiangning, Vice Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Shen Junru, Chairman of the China Democratic League, Huang Yanpei, Chairman of the China Democratic National Construction Association, Chen Shutong, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, Li Jiude, a worker from the Jingxi Coal Mine, Tian Qi, a representative from the Lugouqiao People's Commune, Wang Yurong, a member of the Tianqiao Urban People's Commune, and Jin Ruiying, a student from the Renmin University of China. Their speeches constantly aroused the high-spirited slogans of the audience.

The meeting finally read out a telegram.

At the end of the meeting, the demonstrators applauded and paid tribute to the Japanese friends standing on the Tiananmen Gate, and repeatedly sang the song "Unity is Strength."

Also attending today's meeting were members and alternate members of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, heads of various departments of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and various departments of the State Council, members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and members of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

    据新华社9日讯　首都各界一百多万人，今天举行空前规模的示威和集会，坚决支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的正义斗争。
    强大的示威队伍，挥动着拳头和旗帜，高举着标语牌，愤怒地高呼：“反对复活日本军国主义！”“打倒美帝国主义！”一百多万人的愤怒吼声，同日本人民今天开始的反对日美军事同盟条约斗争第十六次统一行动的吼声，遥相呼应。
    廖承志代表中共中央在大会上庄严宣布：六亿五千万中国人民始终把支持日本人民的斗争，当作自己的神圣义务，把它当作是自己的斗争。他坚信日本人民在全世界人民的支持下，一定能够粉碎侵略的日美军事同盟，把美帝国主义势力从日本彻底驱逐出去。
    今天，北京全城万人空巷。从中午开始，由工人、农民、学生、民兵、解放军战士和市民们组成的示威群众，高呼着口号，涌向天安门广场，汇成一片愤怒的海洋。他们排列着严整的队伍，把通向前门箭楼的整个广场和六华里长的广阔的东西长安街都站满了。在人民大会堂和革命博物馆、历史博物馆的台阶上，在人民英雄纪念碑栏杆四周和金水桥上，也都站满了人群。广场正中的上空，升起了挂着巨幅标语的十个大气球。人们的怒吼声，像汹涌的海涛，一浪高过一浪。
    中共中央总书记邓小平，政治局委员彭真、贺龙、谭震林，候补委员康生，书记处书记王稼祥，候补书记刘澜涛，国务院副总理罗瑞卿、习仲勋，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长沈钧儒、郭沫若、黄炎培、陈叔通、赛福鼎、程潜、林枫，政协全国委员会副主席李四光、包尔汉，国防委员会副主席傅作义，中国人民保卫世界和平委员会副主席廖承志，中华全国总工会副主席刘长胜，全国妇联副主席李德全，共青团中央书记处书记罗毅，中共北京市委第二书记刘仁，参加了今天的大会。

    他以全中国人民的名义宣告：“任何帝国主义对伟大的苏联的挑衅，我们都看作是对整个社会主义阵营的挑衅。”
    廖承志强调：“不论是美帝国主义还是日本军国主义，倘若敢于发动大战，就一定会被战争的火焰烧得一干二净，结果是社会主义在全世界的胜利，资本主义在全世界的灭亡。”
    他在讲话中热烈赞扬日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争，并对英勇不屈的日本人民表示衷心敬意。
    廖承志的讲话，不断激起广场上百万群众狂风暴雨般的掌声。人们发出震天动地的怒吼：“美帝国主义从日本滚出去！从南朝鲜滚出去！从南越滚出去！从土耳其滚出去！从菲律宾滚出去！从我国领土台湾滚出去！”“打倒美帝国主义！”这时，挂着巨幅标语的大气球，随声纷纷飞向天空。
    广场上响起热烈的掌声，欢迎日中友好协会访华代表团团长赤津益造讲话。赤津益造表示感谢中国人民对日本人民斗争的支持。赤津益造说，今天亚洲、非洲的形势正处在历史的新的转折点。我们深信，在东风压倒西风的世界形势下，在反对帝国主义以便在亚洲实现真正的和平共处的斗争里，胜利一定是属于人民这一方面的。他表示，日本人民决心为粉碎日美军事同盟而奋斗到底。
