Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 8th: Japanese figures from all walks of life are increasingly and enthusiastically publishing articles and statements in newspapers and magazines, expressing their opposition to the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

    The "Akahata" newspaper published a statement by the famous Japanese scholar Senroku Uehara, entitled "Don't Antagonize the World." The statement said that Kishi Nobusuke's "government's policy of strengthening the Japan-U.S. military alliance and creating tension in Asia is against the wishes of humanity."
    The statement also said that strengthening the Japan-U.S. military alliance by using the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" means establishing a new military organization between Japan, the Chiang Kai-shek Group, and South Korea. In this way, Japan will become more hostile to China and the Soviet Union and will threaten peace in the Far East. This treaty will allow the Japan "Self-Defense Forces" and the U.S. military to fight together, and will allow nuclear weapons to be brought into Japan and for Japan to send troops abroad. This clearly violates the spirit and provisions of the Japanese Constitution and damages Japan's security and independence.
    The statement said that this treaty will also deprive the Japanese people of their basic human rights and infringe upon their democratic rights.
    Professor Hiroshi Minami of Hitotsubashi University, in a petition to the Diet published in the "Akahata" newspaper, wrote that the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" means the establishment of a Japan-U.S. military alliance, which poses a new threat to world peace and further subordinates Japan to the United States. At the same time, Japan's military budget will increase, militaristic tendencies will be strengthened, and the lives and culture of the Japanese people will be adversely affected.
    "Akahata" also published a collective petition from forty-eight historians from the Japan "Historians Security Treaty Roundtable" and petitions from university professors. They unanimously expressed their opposition to the Diet's approval of the new "Security Treaty."
    The May issue of the Japanese magazine "Sekai" published opinions from various circles on the new "Security Treaty." Writer Takeo Okuno said, "I am absolutely opposed to the new 'Security Treaty' because it is a treaty that threatens our basic right to exist."
    Writer Nobuyuki Tatsuno said that Japan should firmly maintain neutrality. Concluding a new "Security Treaty" with the United States is clearly unconstitutional. Another writer, Itaru Kikumura, wrote: I am absolutely opposed to Japan taking up arms again to wage war. The new "Security Treaty" contains this possibility. Therefore, I oppose this treaty.
    Those who gave speeches in "Sekai" magazine expressing opposition to the new "Security Treaty" included pastors, monks, actors, film directors, painters, critics, and people from all walks of life.

    危害日本独立　威胁世界和平
    日美军事同盟违反人类愿望
    日本各界人士抨击岸信介政府的反动政策
    新华社8日讯　东京消息：日本各界人士愈来愈踊跃地在报刊上发表文章和谈话等，表示反对日美新“安全条约”。
      “赤旗报”刊登了日本著名学者上原专禄发表的一篇题为“不要与世界为敌”的声明。声明说，岸信介“政府企图加强日美军事同盟，制造亚洲紧张局势的方针，是违反人类的愿望的”。
    声明还说，利用日美新“安全条约”加强日美军事同盟，就意味着建立日本同蒋介石集团、南朝鲜之间的新军事组织。这样，日本就会更加敌视中国和苏联，会威胁远东的和平。这个条约将使日本“自卫队”和美军共同作战，并将把核武器运进日本和使日本派兵出国。这显然违反日本宪法的精神和规定，损害日本的安全和独立。
    声明说，这个条约还将剥夺日本人民的基本人权，并侵害日本人民的各项民主权利。
    刊登在“赤旗报”上的一桥大学教授南博向国会提交的请愿书写道，新日美“安全条约”意味着建立日美军事同盟，它对世界和平造成新的威胁，并使日本进一步从属于美国。同时，日本的军事预算将会增加，军国主义倾向将会加强，日本人民的生活和文化都将遭受恶劣的影响。
    “赤旗报”还发表了日本“历史家安全条约恳谈会”的四十八名历史学者的集体请愿书和各大学教授的请愿书。他们一致表示反对国会批准新“安全条约”。
    5月号的日本“世界”杂志发表了各界人士对新“安全条约”的意见。作家奥野健男说，我绝对反对新“安全条约”，“因为这是一项威胁我们的基本生存权利的条约”。
    作家立野信之说，日本应当坚决保持中立。同美国缔结新“安全条约”显然是违反宪法的。另一位作家菊村到写道：我绝对反对日本再次拿起武器进行战争。新“安全条约”包含着这种可能性。因此我反对这个条约。
    在“世界”杂志上发表谈话表示反对新“安全条约”的包括牧师、和尚、演员、电影导演、画家、评论家等各界人士。
