    “Take steel as the key link, and achieve an all-round leap forward.” With increased steel production, the machinery industry can manufacture more and faster the various mechanical equipment and building materials needed for industry and agriculture. Rapidly increasing the quantity and quality of steel is a glorious task set forth by the all-round leap forward situation in industry and agriculture for steel workers.
    From the current situation, the most prominent problem in increasing steel production and quality is to rapidly increase pig iron production. As long as the production and quality of pig iron leap forward, the production of steel and steel materials can be rapidly increased accordingly.
    Can the production and quality of pig iron be rapidly increased? We say: Absolutely yes. Whether from the existing blast furnace volume and mineral resources, or from coal and coke fuels, our province has very favorable conditions. It can be said that "everything is ready except for the east wind." This "east wind" is to continue to muster greater efforts and establish the determination to never give up until we strive for the upstream. With this determination and effort, we can not only give full play to the role of these favorable conditions, but also actively transform unfavorable conditions into favorable conditions, thereby overcoming all difficulties. Therefore, to rapidly increase the production and quality of pig iron, sweeping away complacency and right-leaning conservative thinking, and mustering greater efforts is a prerequisite. Without this, even if other conditions are good, it will be difficult to achieve.
    To increase pig iron production not by a few percent, but by tens of percent, or even several times, and to require a quality qualification rate not of 70 or 80 percent, but of 90 percent or even 100 percent, it should be said that this is also entirely possible. Of course, this is not to say that there are no difficulties in practical work. Difficulties exist, and the task is quite arduous. In particular, some weak links have not been completely broken through. Therefore, under the premise of mustering sufficient efforts, we must also take emergency measures, concentrate superior forces, and encircle and attack the weak links. First, we must conscientiously implement the policy of taking wind as the key and raw materials as the foundation for blast furnace production. We must vigorously develop artificial rich ore, and vigorously develop ore washing and sintering. We must increase the blast furnace start-up rate, and new blast furnaces must be built and put into production as soon as possible to ensure that "more varieties yield more." Second, seize the technical transformation of mines, increase ore production, and ensure that the requirements of "farming three days and having one day off" proposed by the Provincial Party Committee are achieved. Third, vigorously increase the production and quality of coke. All coking plants should carry out a mass movement to increase production, improve quality, and save raw coal. In terms of coal production, we should vigorously increase the production of coke to ensure timely supply to coking plants. Fourth, vigorously improve transportation services for steel production. We must rush to build light railways to and from mines, coking plants, and steel plants to solve short-distance transportation problems. As long as we can do the above aspects of work well, we can rapidly increase the production and quality of pig iron to a higher level.

### 提高钢铁生产的关键何在

    提高钢铁生产的关键何在
    “以钢为纲，全面跃进”，钢铁增加了，机械工业才能更快更多地造出工、农业需要的各种机械设备和建筑材料。迅速提高钢铁的产量和质量，这是工、农业全面跃进的形势给钢铁职工提出的光荣任务。
    从当前的形势来看，要提高钢的产量和质量，最突出的问题是迅速提高生铁的产量，只要生铁产量、质量跃上去了，钢和钢材的生产就可以随之迅速提高。
    能不能使生铁产量、质量迅速跃上去呢？我们说：完全能够。无论是从现有高炉的容积和矿产资源，或是煤焦等燃料方面来看，我省都具备十分有利的条件。可以说是“万事具备，只缺东风”。这股“东风”就是继续鼓足更大的干劲，树立争不到上游誓不罢休的决心。有了这种决心和干劲，不仅可以充分地发挥这些有利条件的作用，而且还可以主动地将不利条件转化为有利条件，从而战胜一切困难。因此，要使生铁产量和质量迅速跃上去，横扫自满情绪和右倾保守思想，鼓足更大干劲，乃是先决条件。没有这一条，其他条件再好，也是难以实现的。
    要使生铁产量不是百分之几，而是百分之几十，甚至成倍地增长，质量要求不是百分之七、八十，而是百分之九十几，甚至百分之百的合格，应当说，这也是完全有可能的。当然，这不是说在实际工作中就没有困难了。困难是有的，任务也是相当艰巨的。特别是某些薄弱环节还没有完全突破。因此，在鼓足干劲的前提下，还要采取紧急措施，集中优势力量，围攻薄弱环节。首先，要认真贯彻高炉生产以风为纲以原料为基础的方针。要大搞人造富矿，大搞矿石洗选和烧结。要增加高炉开炉率，新建的高炉要尽快建成投入生产，保证作到“多种多收”。第二、抓紧矿山技术改造，提高矿石产量，保证实现省委提出的“耕三余一”的要求。第三、大力提高焦炭的产量和质量。各个焦厂应当开展一个提高产量、提高质量、节约原煤的群众运动。在煤炭生产方面，应大力增产焦炭，保证及时供应焦厂需要。第四、大力改进为钢铁生产服务的交通运输工作。要突击修建通往矿山、焦厂、钢铁厂内外的轻便铁路，解决短途运输问题。只要我们能将上述几个方面的工作做好，就能使生铁的产量和质量迅速提高到一个更高的水平。　（摘自大众日报）
