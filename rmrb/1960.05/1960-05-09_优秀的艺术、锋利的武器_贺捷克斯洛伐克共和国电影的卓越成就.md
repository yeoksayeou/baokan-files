    Excellent Art, Sharp Weapon
    —Congratulating the Remarkable Achievements of Czechoslovak Republic Cinema

    In the glorious and splendid Red May, the Chinese people celebrate the fifteenth anniversary of the liberation of our socialist brotherly country, the Czechoslovak Republic. A Czechoslovak Republic Film Week is being held in our capital and major cities across the country. While celebrating this great festival, millions of Chinese viewers will also have the opportunity to appreciate the film art of Czechoslovakia.

    Over the past fifteen years, Czechoslovak filmmakers, like all those engaged in building socialist industry, agriculture, and other cultural and artistic endeavors, have made tremendous contributions to socialist construction, to enriching the cultural lives of working people, and to socialist education and propaganda work under the care and leadership of the Czechoslovak Communist Party. Czechoslovak films are not unfamiliar to our people. In recent years, many excellent Czechoslovak films have been screened in our country. The historical film "New Fighters Stand Up," depicting the struggle of the working class, "Battle Before Dawn," depicting the anti-fascist struggle of the people of Prague in 1945, "Everywhere Tomorrow There is Joyful Song and Dance," expressing the theme of peace and friendship, "Dawn Shines on Us," depicting the life of miners, and "Abduction," exposing the ugly conspiracies of American imperialist bandits, have all left extremely deep impressions on Chinese audiences. These films vividly and realistically portray the fighting experiences and daily life of the Czechoslovak people with highly beautiful artistic forms and techniques, enabling the Chinese people to draw experience from the revolutionary struggle of the Czechoslovak people, and also enabling us to have a greater understanding of the lives of the people of our distant brotherly country, thus enhancing the friendship between the two peoples.

    Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, in addition to carrying out film exchange work between the two countries, the Czechoslovak Party and government have also sent many film art creators, engineering and technical workers to our country to carry out co-production, exchange experience, friendly visits, and technical assistance activities. China's largest and most modern film processing plant, the Beijing Film Processing Plant, was built with the help of Czechoslovakia. From design and construction to mechanical installation, including a complete set of equipment, all were supplied by Czechoslovakia, and dozens of engineering and technical personnel came to our country to participate in the construction of the plant. At the same time as the plant was being built, we also sent key management and engineering and technical personnel to Czechoslovakia to study. It can be said that not only has the excellent film art of Czechoslovakia, this sharp weapon of propaganda and education, played a good role for Chinese film audiences, but also the Czechoslovak film industry, with its long experience, has given great help to the young Chinese film industry.

    The several excellent films screened in this film week also show its rich and colorful content, correct creative thinking, and beautiful artistic form. "The Good Soldier Švejk" (Part 2) depicts a kind and honest Czech soldier in the old society, and through the experience of such a comedic character, exposes the various ugly images of that bygone society. "The Black Battalion" takes the armed aggression of French colonialism against the Vietnamese people as its background. Although it does not directly depict the heroic and great deeds of the Vietnamese people in resisting the enemy, it merely depicts the corruption of French colonialism and its reactionary essence from the side. The "Foreign Legion" described in the film, which was recruited by the French imperialists at low prices, is a common method used by the French rulers against the colonial people and the proletariat of their own country. This "Foreign Legion" is a collection of all kinds of international rogues, including some young people who were deceived and bought by the imperialists to serve as cannon fodder for the reactionaries. The film depicts Polish youth Tadeusz, German youth Gerhardt, and Czechoslovak youth Peter, etc., in this heinous "Black Battalion." These young people finally awaken from being deceived and try to escape the clutches of the reactionaries in various ways. Some sacrificed their lives, and others finally escaped the clutches of colonialism and returned to their people's homeland. The main purpose of the film is to expose the crimes of the reactionaries in plundering colonies and suppressing the people.

    Another film screened during the film week, "The Deadly Invention," is a science fiction film about a scientist who wants to create inventions for the happiness of mankind. His scientific research is successful, but he falls into the hands of a group of bandits. He still holds the naive wishes of a scientific worker and strives to continue working. Later, when he discovers that his invention, under the control of the bandits, not only cannot benefit mankind, but becomes a destructive weapon that the bandits can use to threaten the peace and security of millions of people, this upright scientific worker finally prefers to destroy the achievements of his painstaking invention and creation, and dies together with the bandits. This very clearly demonstrates the relationship between science and politics, illustrating that any scientist always has a class attribute. If the class to which he belongs is reactionary, he will serve the reactionary class and become a tool for oppressing and harming the people. Even science that was originally beneficial to the people and for the benefit of mankind will deteriorate and become harmful to mankind.

    In the excellent Czechoslovak films we have discussed, political ideology is very clear. A beautiful film is different from an article or a speech. It must express its political ideological content through artistic forms and techniques, vivid images, and concise language. Therefore, the more beautiful the form of expression, the sharper its fighting role. From these listed outstanding works, we can see that Czechoslovak filmmakers have made unremitting efforts in these many aspects. We are moved by the fighting content, beautiful form, and vivid images expressed in their films. We extend our heartfelt congratulations to their success.

    优秀的艺术、锋利的武器
    ——贺捷克斯洛伐克共和国电影的卓越成就
    司徒慧敏
    在光辉灿烂的红五月里，中国人民庆祝我们的社会主义兄弟之邦、捷克斯洛伐克共和国解放十五周年。我国首都和全国各大城市正在举行捷克斯洛伐克共和国电影周。中国千千万万观众将在庆祝这个伟大的节日的同时，也得到机会来欣赏捷克斯洛伐克的电影艺术。
    十五年来，捷克斯洛伐克的电影工作者，也如同所有建设社会主义工业、农业、以及其他文化艺术工作者一样，在捷克斯洛伐克共产党的关怀和领导下，为社会主义建设，为丰富劳动人民的文化生活，为社会主义教育宣传工作，作出了巨大的贡献。捷克斯洛伐克电影，对于我国人民说来，已经不是陌生的了。这几年来，我国已经上映过不少捷克斯洛伐克的优秀影片。描写工人阶级斗争的史实影片“新战士站起来”，描写1945年布拉格人民反法西斯斗争的“黎明前的战斗”，表现和平与友谊的主题的“明日处处欢乐歌舞”，描写矿工生活的“曙光照耀着我们”和暴露美帝国主义匪徒的丑恶阴谋活动的“绑架”等影片，早已在中国观众中留下极其深刻的印象。这许多影片都是真实地、生动地以高度的优美艺术形式与手法，表现了捷克斯洛伐克人民的战斗经历与日常生活，使中国人民从捷克斯洛伐克人民的革命斗争中吸取了经验，同时也使我们对遥远的兄弟国家的人民生活有更多的了解，增进了两国人民的友谊。
    中华人民共和国建国以来，除了进行两国的影片交流工作之外，捷克斯洛伐克党和政府还派遣了不少电影艺术创作工作者、工程技术工作者前来我国，进行合作制片，交流经验，友好访问和技术援助等等活动。我国最大、最现代化的电影洗印厂——北京电影洗印厂，是捷克斯洛伐克帮助建设的。这个厂从设计施工到机械安装，而且还包括全套设备都由捷克斯洛伐克供应，前后有几十位工程技术人员前来我国参加建厂工作。与建厂同时，我们还派遣了主要管理与工程技术人员前往捷克斯洛伐克学习。可以说，不仅是捷克斯洛伐克优秀的电影艺术这一种锋利的宣传教育武器，对中国电影观众起了良好作用，而且有悠久经验的捷克斯洛伐克的电影事业，也给年轻的中国电影事业以极大的帮助。
    这次电影周中放映的几部优秀影片，也可以看出它丰富多彩的内容，正确的创作思想和优美的艺术形式。“好兵帅克”（下集）是描写旧社会中一个善良憨直的捷克士兵，由这样一个喜剧人物的经历，暴露那个已经逝去的社会种种丑恶形象。“黑营”是以法国殖民主义者的武装侵略越南人民这一事件为背景，它虽然没有正面描写越南人民抗击敌人的英勇伟大事迹，仅仅是从侧面描画法国殖民主义者的腐败以及它的反动实质。片中所描写的法国帝国主义者以贱价招募来的“外籍军团”，是法国统治者无论对殖民地人民或者对于其本国无产阶级所惯用的手法。这“外籍军团”中，被搜罗的各色各样的国际流氓，其中也包括一些受帝国主义者欺骗收买来为反动派当炮灰的青年。片中描写这罪恶滔天的“黑营”中的波兰青年塔杰乌什，德国青年格尔哈尔特和捷克斯洛伐克青年彼得等。这些青年终于在被欺骗中觉醒过来，要用种种方法逃脱反动派的魔掌，其中有人牺牲了生命，也有人终于从殖民主义的势力下幸免于难，回到了人民的祖国来。影片的主要目的，就是在于暴露反动派掠夺殖民地、压制人民的罪恶。
    电影周上映的另外一部影片“毁灭的发明”，是一部科学幻想片，它描写一个科学家想为人类谋幸福而进行创造发明，他的科学研究成功了，但他却落到一群匪徒的手里。他还是怀着那样天真单纯的科学工作者的愿望，努力继续工作。后来，当他发现自己手上的发明，在匪徒的控制下，不但不能为人类谋福利，反而成为一种毁灭性的武器，匪徒们可以用这种武器，来威胁千千万万人民的和平与安全。这个正直的科学工作者，终于宁愿毁掉自己费尽心血所获得的发明创造的成绩，与匪徒同归于尽。这里很鲜明的表现了科学和政治的关系，说明了任何科学家，他总有一个阶级的属性，如果所属的阶级是反动的，他就会为反动阶级服务，成为压迫人民、损害人民的工具，即使原来是有益人民、为人类谋福利的科学，也会变质，成为对人类有害的科学。
    在我们所论述的优秀捷克斯洛伐克影片中，政治思想性是很鲜明的。一部优美的电影不同于一篇文章，一篇演稿，它必须通过艺术的形式与手法，鲜明生动的形象和精炼的语言，来表达它的政治思想内容。因而表达的形式越是优美，它的战斗作用就越是锋利。从这些列举的优秀作品中，可以看出捷克斯洛伐克的电影工作者在这许多方面已经做了不懈的努力。我们为他们电影中所表现的战斗的内容、优美的形式和鲜明生动的形象所感动。我们为他们的成功致衷心的祝贺。
