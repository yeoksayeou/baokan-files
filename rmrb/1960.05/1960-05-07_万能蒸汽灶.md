The "Universal Steam Stove" has been widely promoted in Houma City, Shanxi Province. In addition to frying and stir-frying, this type of steam stove can use steam for all processes such as steaming buns and boiling water. Furthermore, steam can be used as power to mechanize and automate tasks such as pressing noodles, cutting vegetables, washing rice, and cleaning stoves, increasing work efficiency by six to thirty-nine times. In the past, the Quwo Catering Main Store had nine stoves and twenty-six cooks who worked continuously for more than ten hours a day, from 3:00 AM to 6:00 PM, and could only prepare meals for over 1,000 people. After building the "Universal Steam Stove," steaming 500 jin of buns was reduced from one and a half hours to twelve minutes; cooking 40 jin of noodles was reduced from two hours to three minutes (previously, only 5 jin could be cooked in one pot); cooking 1,000 jin of vegetables used to take two and a half hours, but now it only takes sixteen minutes; boiling 600 jin of water was reduced from one hour to three minutes. This store has over sixty kinds of dishes, and forty kinds are made using the steam stove. Now, this restaurant has reduced the number of cooks by four, the working hours have been shortened by five hours, and the number of customers served daily has increased from over 1,000 to over 4,000. Moreover, the phenomenon of queuing for meals has been eliminated.

    “万能蒸汽灶”
    山西省侯马市普遍推广了“万能蒸汽灶”。这种蒸汽灶除煮油、炒菜外，所有蒸馒头、烧水等工序都可利用蒸汽，并可以蒸汽为动力，使压面、切菜、淘米、洗刷灶具等工作机械化、自动化，提高工效六至三十九倍。曲沃饮食业总店，过去有九个灶，二十六个炊事员，每天从早上三点到下午六点，连续工作十多个小时，只能做一千多人的饭。建成“万能蒸汽灶”，蒸五百斤馒头由过去一个半小时缩短到十二分钟；煮四十斤面条由过去两小时缩短为三分钟（过去一锅只能煮五斤）；熬一千斤菜过去得两个半小时，现在只需十六分钟；烧六百斤水，由一个小时缩短到三分钟。这个店有六十多种饭菜，利用蒸汽灶做的就有四十种。现在，这个饮食店减少了四个炊事员，工作时间缩短了五小时，每天接待的顾客由过去的一千多名增加到四千多名。而且消灭了排队等饭现象。
