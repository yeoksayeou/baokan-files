Xinhua News Agency, May 2nd. Speech by Vice Premier He Long at the Banquet Welcoming the Delegation of the Provisional Government of Algeria:

Your Honorable Deputy Prime Minister Krim Belkacem, Esteemed Guests of the Delegation of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, Friends, Comrades:

We are greatly honored to host this banquet for the Delegation of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, led by Your Honorable Deputy Prime Minister Krim Belkacem. Please allow me to extend our warm welcome and heartfelt respect from the Chinese government and the Chinese people to the esteemed guests.

The Chinese people have always followed the heroic struggle of the Algerian people with admiration. For more than five years, the heroic Algerian people have resolutely persisted in armed struggle under extremely difficult conditions, winning a series of victories and liberating vast territories.

In order to save its colonial rule in Algeria, which is on the verge of collapse, French imperialism has intensified its armed suppression, launching frenzied attacks on the Algerian National Liberation Army, while at the same time doing everything possible to engage in political conspiracies to deceive the Algerian people, attempting to achieve aims that it cannot achieve by military means alone. The US imperialism, which has always attempted to dominate the world, is vigorously supporting France's political conspiracies and armed suppression of the Algerian people, while plotting to interfere in Algerian affairs and replace the position of French colonial rule. However, no matter how the French and American imperialists collude to attack the Algerian people, they have been shamefully defeated again and again under the powerful blows of the Algerian people.

The heroic struggle of the Algerian people has not only tied down the main force of the French colonial army, giving powerful support to other African nations striving for independence from French colonial oppression, but also set a brilliant example for the cause of national liberation in Africa and the world, inspiring their struggles. We are pleased to see that now, the vast African continent, under the call of the heroic Algerian people, has been swept into a wave of struggle against imperialism and colonialism. The imperialist colonial system in Africa is in the process of disintegration. About half of the African population has already shaken off the colonial yoke, and a series of countries will gain independence one after another this year. African countries that have already freed themselves from colonial rule are also fighting to safeguard their national independence. The imperialists' long-planned subversive conspiracy against Guinea has recently suffered a shameful defeat under the forceful counterattack of the Guinean people. The Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference held in Conakry not long ago issued a call to the African people to completely eradicate imperialism and decided to provide active support. This conference will have an extremely favorable impact on the national independence movements in Africa and the world. The heroic struggles of the South Korean and Turkish people against US imperialism and its puppets prove that the direction of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference is correct, and that the path of struggle of the Algerian people and the African people is playing a positive role in every corner of the world. The heroic struggles and great victories of the African people have liberated the broad masses of people from cruel colonial oppression, dealt a heavy blow to the aggressive forces of imperialism, and have therefore made a great contribution to maintaining world peace. The Chinese people and the African people, like the people of Asia and Latin America, have common experiences and common tasks of struggle. The Chinese people have always resolutely supported the struggle of the African people for national independence, and will, as always, stand together with the African people and fight to the end against imperialism and colonialism.

The friendship between the Chinese people and the Algerian people has a deep foundation, and the common cause of opposing imperialism closely links us together. In the past two years, the friendly relations between our two countries have been developing continuously. We have received many delegations from your country, and these delegations' visits to our country have made important contributions to the development of friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries and the friendship between our two peoples. Today, we are honored to receive the Delegation of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria headed by Your Honorable Deputy Prime Minister Krim Belkacem, and we firmly believe that this visit by the delegation will further strengthen the mutual understanding between our two peoples and consolidate and develop the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries. Finally, on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, allow me to solemnly express to the Delegation of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria that the 650 million Chinese people will resolutely support the Algerian people's national liberation struggle to the end!

I propose a toast:

To the friendship between the Chinese people and the Algerian people!
To the victory of the Algerian national liberation struggle!
To the victory of the national democratic movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America!
To Asian-African solidarity!
To world peace!
To the health of Prime Minister Abbas!
To the health of Your Honorable Deputy Prime Minister Krim Belkacem and all the esteemed guests of the delegation!
Cheers!

    在欢迎阿尔及利亚临时政府代表团的宴会上
    贺龙副总理的讲话
    新华社2日讯　贺龙副总理在欢迎阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团宴会上的讲话尊敬的克里姆·贝勒卡塞姆副总理阁下，尊敬的阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团全体贵宾们，朋友们，同志们：
    我们十分荣幸地在这里设宴招待由克里姆·贝勒卡塞姆副总理阁下率领的阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团。请允许我向尊敬的贵宾们转达中国政府和中国人民的热烈的欢迎和衷心的敬意。
    中国人民一向怀着敬佩的心情关注着阿尔及利亚人民的英勇斗争。五年多来，英勇的阿尔及利亚人民在极端困难的条件下，顽强地坚持着武装斗争，赢得了一系列的胜利，解放了大片的国土。
    法国帝国主义为了挽回它在阿尔及利亚大势已去的殖民统治，一方面加紧武装镇压，向阿尔及利亚民族解放军实行疯狂的进攻，一方面千方百计地玩弄政治阴谋，欺骗阿尔及利亚人民，企图达到它单靠军事手段无法达到的目的。一向企图独霸世界的美帝国主义，正在一方面大力支持法国的政治阴谋和对阿尔及利亚人民的武装镇压，一方面阴谋插手阿尔及利亚的事务，取代法国殖民统治的地位。但是不管法、美帝国主义如何勾结起来向阿尔及利亚人民进攻，它们在阿尔及利亚人民的有力打击下，终于一次又一次地遭到了可耻的失败。
    阿尔及利亚人民的英勇斗争，不仅拖住了法国殖民军队的主力，给了非洲其他从法国殖民主义压迫下争取独立的民族以有力的支持，而且为全非洲和全世界争取民族解放的事业树立了光辉的榜样，鼓舞了他们的斗争。我们高兴地看到，现在，广大的非洲大陆，在英勇的阿尔及利亚人民的号召之下，都卷入了反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义的斗争浪潮。帝国主义在非洲的殖民体系正处在土崩瓦解的过程。占非洲人口半数左右的人民已经摆脱了殖民枷锁，今年还将有一系列国家相继取得独立。已经摆脱了殖民统治的非洲国家也正在为维护民族独立而斗争。帝国主义蓄谋已久的对几内亚的颠复阴谋，最近在几内亚人民的有力反击下，已经遭到了可耻的失败。不久以前在科纳克里举行的亚非人民团结大会向非洲人民发出了彻底铲除帝国主义的战斗号召，并决定给予积极的支援。这次大会对非洲和全世界的民族独立运动必将发生极为有利的影响。南朝鲜人民和土耳其人民反对美帝国主义及其傀儡的英勇斗争，证明亚非人民团结大会的方向是正确的，证明阿尔及利亚人民和非洲人民的斗争道路正在世界各个角落发挥积极的作用。非洲人民的英勇斗争和巨大胜利，使广大人民从残酷的殖民压迫下解放出来，给帝国主义侵略势力以沉重的打击，因而也就对维护世界和平作出了伟大的贡献。中国人民和非洲人民，如同和亚洲、拉丁美洲人民一样，有共同的遭遇和共同的斗争任务。中国人民一向坚决支持非洲人民争取民族独立的斗争，今后也将始终不渝地同非洲人民站在一起，为反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义斗争到底。
    中国人民和阿尔及利亚人民的友谊有深厚的基础，反对帝国主义的共同事业把我们紧密地联结在一起。近两年来，我们两国的友好关系一直在不断地发展。我们曾经接待过来自你们国家的不少代表团，这些代表团对我国的访问为我们两国友好合作关系和两国人民友谊的发展作出了重要的贡献。今天，我们又光荣地接待以克里姆·贝勒卡塞姆副总理阁下为首的阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团，我们深信，代表团的这次访问必将进一步加强我们两国人民之间的相互了解，巩固和发展我们两国之间的友好合作关系。最后，让我代表中国政府和中国人民，向阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团庄严地表示，六亿五千万中国人民对阿尔及利亚人民民族解放斗争坚决支持到底！
    我提议：
    为中国人民和阿尔及利亚人民的友谊
    为阿尔及利亚民族解放斗争的胜利
    为亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲民族民主运动的胜利
    为亚非团结
    为世界和平
    为阿巴斯总理阁下的健康
    为克里姆·贝勒卡塞姆副总理阁下和代表团全体贵宾的健康
    干杯！
