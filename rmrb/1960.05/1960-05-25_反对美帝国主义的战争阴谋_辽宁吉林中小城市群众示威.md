Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 24th: In the past three days, a total of 1.63 million people in Fushun, Jinzhou, Benxi, Fuxin, Chaoyang and other cities and their respective counties in Liaoning Province held rallies and demonstrations respectively, firmly supporting the solemn position of the Soviet Union and angrily condemning U.S. imperialism for undermining the Four-Power Summit.

　　Fushun City and its counties had 700,000 people who held unprecedented grand rallies and demonstrations on the morning of the 23rd. From the city center to Qingyuan and Xinbin counties, 300 miles away from the urban area, there were angry demonstrators everywhere. The roar they emitted drowned out the factory whistles and the roar of motors. In the demonstration ranks, many people had close and friendly exchanges with the Soviet people, and many people had personally competed with U.S. imperialism. Pang Guanxiang, a well-known coal mining expert who visited the Soviet Union last fall, said during the demonstration that today the East wind absolutely prevails over the West wind. If U.S. imperialism dares to play with fire, its end is destined to be the same as Hitler's, and it will be uprooted by the peace-loving people of the world. Tian Guoying, who shot down invading U.S. military bombers in Korea, and Dai Wenxue, who won the Second Class Merit in the counterattack at the Imjin River in Korea, are now coal miners. On the day of the parade, they wore miner's uniforms and shiny medals. Tian Guoying angrily told people: U.S. imperialism sent spy planes to the Soviet Union to provoke and deliberately undermine the Four-Power Summit, once again exposing the despicable and shamelessness of U.S. imperialism. He said that we will not attack unless we are attacked; if the enemy dares to invade, we will definitely wipe them out.

　　Shen Yue, First Secretary of the Fushun Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and other party and government leaders, as well as the responsible persons of local organizations of various democratic parties and people's organizations, participated in the meeting. Experts from the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and the German Democratic Republic in Fushun, as well as Vietnamese students, also participated in the meeting.

　　After the meeting began, Shen Yue spoke first, representing the people of the city in expressing firm support for the solemn position of the Soviet Union, defending world peace, and severely condemning the war provocations of U.S. imperialism. Soviet expert representative Karachov then spoke amidst warm applause. When he said that "all the Soviet people and all peace-loving people in the world denounce the provocative actions of the U.S. government and condemn the U.S. government for undermining the Four-Power Summit," all the demonstrators chanted together: "Support the solemn position of the Soviet government on the aggressive crimes of U. S. imperialism!", "Long live the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!" and "Long live the great unity of the people of the world!"

　　Zhao Jian, Vice Chairman of the Fushun Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, Guo Minren, representative of local organizations of democratic parties in Fushun, Gong Zhanyuan, representative of people's organizations, and representatives of workers and farmers also spoke at the meeting. Worker representative and outstanding coal mining electric pick driver Jia Lianfu said at the meeting: We, the 300,000 employees in Fushun City, like the people of the whole country, express great anger at U.S. imperialism's deliberate undermining of the Four-Power Summit. We are determined to stand with the Soviet people and the peace-loving people of the world to shatter the evil conspiracy of U.S. imperialism to undermine world peace.

Xiao Chun, First Secretary of the Jinzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, said at the meeting in the central venue that we must fiercely oppose the aggression and sabotage activities of U.S. imperialism and its accomplices and lackeys.

Then, Lu Hetian, representative of people's organizations, Tian Yuchun, representative of local organizations of democratic parties, Huo Yuqing, representative of workers, and Mu Hongzhi, representative of farmers, spoke at the meeting successively.

　　Over 200,000 people in Benxi City held rallies and demonstrations on the 22nd. More than 2,500 steel warriors from Benxi Iron and Steel Plant participated in the parade and demonstration. The militiamen of Benxi Iron and Steel Company Electromechanical Plant and Benxi Normal School, who had won the title of National Militia Model, participated in the meeting fully armed. Ren Zhiyuan, First Secretary of the Benxi Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, stated at the meeting that the people of Benxi City will be with the people of the whole country to resolutely defend socialist construction and world peace. Following him, the Deputy Mayor, Deputy Secretary of the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, and labor models also spoke at the meeting.
