Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 15th: The struggle of the residents of Geochang County, Gyeongsangnam-do, South Korea, to demand the punishment of the Syngman Rhee clique's executioners is still ongoing.

As previously reported, residents of Shinyuan Township (formerly translated as Shinwon Township) in Geochang County executed the then-township head (i.e., district head) on the evening of the 11th, who had actively participated in the "Geochang Massacre" that slaughtered a large number of innocent residents. After the incident, the South Korean puppet authorities took brutal suppression measures, even mobilizing police, troops, and thugs to deal with the people of Geochang County who were righteously avenging the enemy. Twenty-two people were arrested.

On the afternoon of the 13th, more than 400 local residents, filled with righteous indignation, stormed into the police station, each claiming to be the mastermind behind the incident, demanding that the police either arrest them all or release the arrested residents.

The residents also exposed the crimes of the main culprits of the "Geochang Massacre" at the time, such as then-Syngman Rhee's puppet Minister of Defense Shin Sung-mo, puppet Vice Commander of the Military Police Kim Jong-won, and puppet National Assembly member Yu Bong-chun, and strongly demanded that these people be punished immediately.

Seoul Radio said that, intimidated by the momentum of the people's protests, the puppet authorities had stopped "the investigation of this case" from that day on and had to release all 22 arrested residents.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 17th: Seoul report: Students across South Korea continue to wage struggles for democracy and freedom, and people everywhere continue to rise up to punish the US-Syngman Rhee clique's lackeys.

According to Seoul Broadcasting Station, students and professors at Chosun University in Gwangju today launched a struggle to expel Park Cheol-woo, the chairman of the university's foundation board and president of the university, from the school. The majority of the university's professors reached a unanimous resolution to get Park Cheol-woo to leave. They also decided to launch a sit-down demonstration struggle from 9:00 AM today to implement this demand. Today, Park Cheol-woo's lackeys obstructed this struggle, and as a result, the vast majority of students rose up and fought against this small group of lackeys with stones.

According to reports, yesterday more than 700 high school students in Gunsan attacked and vandalized the offices of the "Gunsan Daily." The students protested against the newspaper's defamation of their school in its commentaries.

According to the Dongyang News Agency, the South Korean puppet authorities' "Chief of Public Security" said in Seoul this morning that "retaliatory acts" had occurred in many places around Seoul. This shows that the angry South Korean people are rising up one after another to punish the henchmen of the US-Syngman Rhee clique who usually oppress the people.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 17th: Seoul report: Another major massacre of innocent South Korean people committed by the US-Syngman Rhee clique has been exposed.

According to Busan Cultural Broadcasting Station, on February 5th and 7th, 1951, the Ninth Regiment of the Syngman Rhee puppet's 15th Division, known as the "White Bones Unit," collectively massacred more than 800 residents, including women and children, in Geumseo Township, Sancheong County, and Hamyang Township, Hamyang County, Gyeongsangnam-do.

This massacre was also masterminded by Kim Jong-won, the executioner who committed the "Geochang Massacre," who was then serving as the "Civil Affairs Director of the Martial Law Command" of the Syngman Rhee puppet regime. At the time, they deceived the residents there into listening to so-called "current affairs lectures." After the residents gathered together, they were subjected to machine gun fire by the Syngman Rhee puppet troops stationed around them. After brutally killing these residents, the Syngman Rhee puppet troops set fire to the corpses to cover up the traces.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 13th: According to the Korean Central News Agency: The bloody crimes of the US-Syngman Rhee clique in suppressing the South Korean people are being further exposed.

A dispatch from Seoul by the Hapdong News Agency revealed that former puppet "Minister of Home Affairs" Hong Jin-ki ordered the Syngman Rhee puppet military police to indiscriminately open fire on the demonstrators in Seoul on April 19th. A recording of his "order" shows that he ordered the former puppet "Director of Public Security" to send police equipped with rifles to suppress the demonstrators who were marching towards Syngman Rhee's "official residence." The Dongyang News Agency reported that the Syngman Rhee puppet military police fired more than 8,000 bullets at peaceful demonstrators in Seoul that day on his orders. The Syngman Rhee puppet military police in various parts of South Korea also took similar brutal actions.

According to foreign news agencies from Seoul, during the large-scale demonstrations held by the South Korean people, in April alone, the Syngman Rhee puppet military police used tanks, machine guns, carbines, etc. supplied by the United States, killing at least 183 demonstrators and injuring another 6,259 people.

According to a dispatch from Busan by the Dongyang News Agency, Park Young-pyo (transliteration), the former guard captain of the Masan puppet "Police Bureau," admitted that on March 15th, the Syngman Rhee puppet military police fired countless bullets at the Masan citizens who were demonstrating, and also used tear gas to kill and injure people.

Under the strong pressure from the South Korean people demanding the punishment of the murderers, the South Korean puppet "caretaker cabinet" is currently forced to conduct so-called "investigations" into certain Syngman Rhee puppet police officers to deceive the people. In reality, the puppet clique is shielding these executioners and is directing the original Syngman Rhee puppet military police to further suppress the South Korean people.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 17th: Seoul report: The US aggressor troops occupying South Korea have again killed two South Koreans in succession.

According to a United Press International dispatch from Seoul today, on the evening of the 15th, an American soldier of the First Cavalry Division named John Freeman shot and killed a seventeen-year-old South Korean youth for no reason in the barracks' washroom.

According to Seoul Broadcasting Station, on the morning of the 14th, when three South Koreans were passing near the base of the US First Cavalry Division, US Staff Sergeant Hoyle shouted and chased after them for no reason. When one of the 35-year-old South Koreans returned, he shot and killed him.

The atrocities of the US aggressor troops occupying South Korea, such as raping women, openly robbing, injuring people with vehicles, and killing and looting, are too numerous to count. According to incomplete statistics, from January to March this year alone, the crimes of the US aggressor troops directly harming the lives of South Korean residents reached as many as 11 cases, resulting in the death or serious injury of 65 South Korean youths, children, and women.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 13th: Seoul report: According to the South Korean World News Agency, more than 800 workers at the Busan Daehan Pottery Factory began a strike and held a sit-down demonstration this morning.

The report said that they demanded the immediate payment of wages that had been in arrears for three months, a 50% increase in wages, and improved working conditions. The workers said they would continue the struggle until their demands were met.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 16th: Seoul report: The South Korean people have recently launched a struggle to resist paying taxes and levies, and the Heo Jeong group is facing a serious financial crisis.

According to Seoul Broadcasting Station, in the first ten days of May, the puppet financial authorities collected only 3.864 billion won in "domestic tax," almost half of the 7.172 billion won collected in the first ten days of April. The radio station said that after the 500,000-person demonstration in Seoul on April 26th, "the increasingly shrinking tax revenue has not improved in the slightest, but has continued to deteriorate." The "caretaker cabinet" of the Heo Jeong group, which replaced Syngman Rhee, "is facing a crisis of financial collapse."

According to Chuncheon Broadcasting Station, the taxes and levies collected in Chuncheon City in the first four months of this year only reached 20% of the planned collection. The radio station said that the reason was that after the people in Seoul and other places launched demonstrations on April 19th, "the citizens lacked an attitude of assisting the authorities."

According to reports, the prices of consumer goods in Seoul are constantly rising. The Dongyang News Agency quoted data from the "Bank of Korea" survey saying that as of May 14th, the wholesale price index for various consumer goods such as grain, paper, and cotton cloth had risen by 5.9% compared to a month ago.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 17th: Seoul report: Just as the South Korean people are angrily demanding the punishment of the Syngman Rhee puppet police who massacred the people, US imperialism is taking out a large amount of money to increase the salaries of the Syngman Rhee puppet police, buying off these executioners to continue to maintain its fascist rule in South Korea.

According to the World News Agency, the "Ministry of Home Affairs" of the Heo Jeong puppet clique revealed today that it would increase the salaries of the police by two to five times. This was decided by the puppet "Ministry of Home Affairs" after soliciting the opinions of the "US Economic Cooperation Office in Korea." The report said that the "US Economic Cooperation Office in Korea" "expressed full support and agreement" for this matter and would provide funds "to improve the treatment of the (Syngman Rhee puppet) police" under the US "special assistance program."

As previously reported, the United States also plans to send so-called "technical" personnel to "conduct a large-scale training program" for the South Korean Syngman Rhee puppet police, and has instructed the Heo Jeong group to add a so-called "Anti-Communist Section" to the police organization in an attempt to more brutally suppress the South Korean people.

    南朝鲜人民英勇不屈斗志昂扬
    不断揭露美李集团屠杀惨案　奋起惩办刽子手
    釜山八百工人罢工　各地人民抗缴捐税
    新华社平壤15日电　南朝鲜庆尚南道居昌郡居民们要求惩办李承晚集团刽子手的斗争仍在进行中。
    前已报道，居昌郡神院面（前译新院面）的居民在11日晚处死了积极参与屠杀大批无辜居民的“居昌大惨案”的当时的伪面长（即区长）。在事件发生以后，南朝鲜傀儡当局采取了横暴镇压的措施，竟调动警察、军队和打手来对付正义地向敌人复仇的居昌郡人民。有二十二人被捕。
    13日下午，当地四百多个居民激于义愤冲入派出所，人人自称是事件的主谋，要求警察要末把他们全部抓起来，要末就把被捕的居民释放。
    居民们还揭露当时的李伪国防部长官申性摸、伪宪兵副司令金钟元、伪国会议员俞凤淳等制造“居昌大惨案”的首恶分子的罪行，并且强烈要求立即惩办这些人。
    汉城电台说，傀儡当局慑于人民抗议的声势，已从那一天起停止对“这个案件的侦查”，并不得不把被捕的二十二个居民全部释放。
    新华社平壤17日电　汉城消息：南朝鲜各地的学生继续展开争取民主和自由的斗争，各地人民也继续起来惩办美李集团的狗腿子。
    据汉城广播电台广播，光州朝鲜大学的学生和教授们今天展开了驱逐这个大学的财团理事长兼校长朴哲禹出校的斗争。这个大学的大部分教授们达成了一致的决议，要朴哲禹滚蛋。并且决定从今天上午九时开始为贯彻这一要求展开静坐示威斗争。今天有朴哲禹的狗腿子阻挠这一斗争，结果绝大多数学生起来同这一小撮狗腿子用石块进行了战斗。
    另据报道，昨天群山市有七百多名高等学校的学生袭击和破坏了“群山日报”的办公室。学生们抗议这家报纸在评论中诽谤了他们的学校。
    据东洋通讯社报道，南朝鲜伪当局的“治安局长”今天上午在汉城说，汉城一带在许多地方发生了“报复行为”。这说明，愤怒的南朝鲜人民正在纷纷起来惩办平时欺压人民的美李集团的爪牙。
    新华社平壤17日电　汉城消息：美李集团制造的又一件屠杀南朝鲜无辜人民的大惨案被揭露出来。
    据釜山文化广播电台广播，1951年2月5日和7日，号称“白骨部队”的李伪第十五师团第九联队，在庆尚南道的山清郡今西面和咸阳郡咸阳面集体屠杀了八百多名包括妇女和儿童在内的居民。
    这一惨案也是制造“居昌大惨案”的刽子手、当时担任李伪“戒严司令部民事部长”的金钟元主谋制造的。当时他们欺骗那里的居民去听所谓“时事演讲”，居民们集合到一起以后，却遭到布置在周围的李伪军的机枪扫射。李伪军队在惨杀了这些居民以后，为了灭迹，还放火焚烧了尸体。
    新华社平壤13日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社消息：美李集团镇压南朝鲜人民的血腥罪行正在不断地进一步暴露。
    合同通讯社从汉城发出的一则消息透露，前伪“内务部长官”洪璡基在4月19日命令李伪军警不分青红皂白地向汉城的示威群众开枪。他的“命令”的录音表明，他曾下令前伪“治安局局长”派出有来福枪装备的警察镇压冲向李承晚“官邸”的示威群众。东洋通讯社报道，李伪军警在那一天奉他的命令向汉城的和平的示威群众开枪打了八千多发子弹。南朝鲜各地的李伪军警也采取了类似的残暴行动。
    据外国通讯社从汉城发出的消息说，在南朝鲜人民举行大规模示威斗争期间，仅仅在4月份，李伪军警使用美国供应的坦克、机关炮、卡宾枪等，至少打死示威群众一百八十三人，另有六千二百五十九人受伤。
    据东洋通讯社从釜山发出的消息说，前马山伪“警察局”的卫队长朴荣彪（译音）承认，在3月15日，李伪军警对举行示威的马山市民打了无数发子弹，而且还使用催泪弹杀伤人民。
    在南朝鲜人民要求惩办杀人凶犯的强大压力下，南朝鲜伪“看守内阁”目前不得不对某些李伪警察人员进行所谓“调查”，来欺骗人民。实际上伪傀儡集团是在掩护这些刽子手，并且正在指使原来的李伪军警进一步镇压南朝鲜人民。
    新华社平壤17日电　汉城消息：强占在南朝鲜的美国侵略军又接连行凶杀死两名南朝鲜人。
    据合众国际社今天发自汉城的消息说，15日晚上，美国骑兵第一师的一个叫约翰·弗里曼的士兵在兵营漱洗室里无故开枪打死了一个十七岁的南朝鲜青年。
    另据汉城广播电台广播，14日晨，当三名南朝鲜人路过美国骑兵第一师部队驻地附近时，美军上士霍伊耳无端地喊着追赶他们。当其中一名三十五岁的南朝鲜人返回来时，他竟开枪把他打死了。
    强占在南朝鲜的美国侵略军强奸妇女、明火抢劫、驱车伤人、杀人越货的暴行是罄竹难书的。据不完全统计，只是今年1月到3月，仅美国侵略军直接残害南朝鲜居民生命的罪行即达十一起，结果使六十五名南朝鲜青年、儿童和妇女死亡或受了重伤。
    新华社平壤13日电　汉城消息：据南朝鲜世界通讯社报道，釜山大韩陶器工厂的八百多名工人今天上午开始罢工并举行静坐示威。
    消息说，他们要求立刻发给拖欠了三个月的工资，要求提高工资50％和改善劳动条件。工人们表示将继续斗争，直到他们的要求得到满足为止。
    新华社平壤16日电　汉城消息：南朝鲜人民最近展开了抗缴捐税的斗争，许政集团正面临着严重的财政危机。
    据汉城广播电台广播，5月份的头十天，伪财政当局征收到手的“国内税”只有三十八亿六千四百万圜，比4月份头十天征收的七十一亿七千二百万圜几乎少了一半。这家电台说，4月26日汉城五十万人大示威之后，“日益萎缩的税收不仅没有丝毫的好转，反而继续恶化。”代替李承晚的许政集团的“看守内阁”“正面临着财政破产的危机”。
    据春川广播电台广播，春川市今年头四个月征收到的捐税只达到预定征收的20％。这家电台说，原因是4月19日汉城等地人民展开示威斗争后，“市民们缺乏协助当局的态度”。
    另据报道，汉城的消费商品的价格不断地上涨。东洋通讯社引用的“韩国银行”调查的资料说，到5月14日为止，粮食、纸类、棉布等各种消费商品的批发价格总指数比一个月以前上涨了5.9％。
    新华社平壤17日电　汉城消息：正当南朝鲜人民愤怒地要求惩办残杀人民的李伪警察的时候，美帝国主义却拿出大批金钱来给李伪警察增薪，收买这些刽子手来继续维持它在南朝鲜的法西斯统治。
    据世界通讯社报道，许政伪傀儡集团的“内务部”今天透露，要把警察的薪金提高一倍到五倍。这是伪“内务部”征求了“美国驻韩经济合作处”的意见以后决定的。报道说，“美国驻韩经济合作处”对这件事“表示完全支持和同意”，并将根据美国的“特别援助方案”来提供款项“改善（李伪）警察的待遇”。
    前已报道，美国还计划增派所谓有“技术”的人员对南朝鲜的李伪警察“进行一个大规模的训练计划”，并且指使许政集团在警察机构里添设了所谓“反共科”，企图更加残暴地镇压南朝鲜人民。
