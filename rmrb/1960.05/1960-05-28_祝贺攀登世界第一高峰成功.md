As the people of our country, full of vigor, continue to make great strides on all fronts of socialist construction, news of victory has come from the Himalayas: the Chinese mountaineering team, with dauntless heroism, has safely ascended the 8,882-meter-high summit of Mount Everest along its north slope. This is another new achievement of world significance created by our mountaineers after the victories of climbing Mount Tiehching, Mount Gongga, and Mount Muztagh Ata. We extend our warm congratulations and high respect to all members of the Chinese mountaineering team.

Mount Everest in the Himalayas is the highest peak in the world. Its mountain body is magnificent and reaches straight into the clouds, towering among the peaks of the Himalayas. The people of the countries surrounding the Himalayas, especially the people of China and Nepal, have a particularly deep affection for it, singing and praising it for generations. However, this majestic peak is covered with snow all year round, the climate is changeable, the air is thin, and it is surrounded by huge glaciers, making it difficult for people to reach. Not only is it such a difficult world peak to climb, but also because humans know very little about its geography, climate, biology, and other conditions, mountaineers, adventurers, and scientists from all over the world are very interested in it, referring to it as the "third pole" of the world along with the South and North Poles, and constantly going there for climbing and exploration. According to records, in 1953 and 1956, a few foreign mountaineers successfully climbed the summit twice from the gentler southern slope. Foreign mountaineers and adventurers have also repeatedly tried to climb the summit from its north face, but because this side has a complex terrain and is more difficult to climb than the south slope, none have succeeded. The Chinese mountaineering team's ability to climb to the summit from its north slope is a first in the world. Although climbing the summit from the north slope is an unusually difficult task that predecessors had tried many times without success, the young mountaineers of New China would not bow their heads in the face of difficulties. Under the encouragement of the Party's General Line and the spirit of the Great Leap Forward, and with the support of all parties, with the courageous and hardworking heroic spirit of the Chinese people, they overcame various difficulties such as glaciers and the changeable climate of high mountains, and victoriously ascended the summit from the north, accomplishing what predecessors had not done. This success of world significance is not only the glory of our sports community but also the glory of our people. In order to ensure the victory of this mountaineering expedition, the people of the whole country gave material support and spiritual encouragement in many ways. Our metallurgical industry, chemical industry, clothing industry, and food industry researched and manufactured various mountaineering equipment for them, especially the Tibetan compatriots under the Himalayas, who gave them very enthusiastic support. These are important guarantees for the Chinese mountaineering team to create this world achievement. This is also a great victory for the superiority of our socialist system. Now, on the south slope of the mountain and elsewhere, mountaineers from other countries are also advancing towards Mount Everest, and we wish them success.

The success of our mountaineering team in climbing Mount Everest will greatly encourage and promote the development of mass mountaineering in our country. Our country's sports are for enhancing the people's physique, cultivating people's strong fighting will, and serving socialist construction. Mountaineering is in line with these goals. Mountaineering requires crossing various complex terrains and enduring strong sunlight and changeable climates, which requires people to have extremely good adaptability, strong physical strength and endurance, and a spirit of collectivism of helping each other and uniting in friendship. Therefore, this sport can not only enhance people's physique but also cultivate people's communist moral qualities. At the same time, our country is a mountainous country, with two-thirds of its land crisscrossed by mountains. Every mountain range contains extremely rich underground resources, which we need to discover and utilize. Therefore, training mountaineers and widely developing mountaineering have great significance for promoting our country's scientific research and construction.

The ascent of Chinese mountaineers to Mount Everest not only has a major encouraging and promoting effect on the development of our sports cause, but also has a huge encouraging effect on the continued leap forward of the people of the whole country. Because it vividly proves that under the leadership of the great Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people are invincible. Our mountaineering movement has only a short five-year history, but thanks to the care and support of the Party and the people, the athletes have adhered to putting politics in command, highly promoted the communist style of daring to think and act, and the spirit of collectivism, which has enabled their physical fitness and mountaineering skills to develop and improve extremely rapidly, thus achieving the victory of climbing Mount Everest. This fact proves that in front of us, we can do things that predecessors have not yet done. Let us learn from the dauntless heroism of the comrades of the mountaineering team who climbed the world's highest peak—Mount Everest—and set off an even greater leap forward climax on all construction fronts!

    祝贺攀登世界第一高峰成功
    正当我国人民意气风发在社会主义建设各个战线上继续大跃进的时候，从喜马拉雅山传来了喜讯，中国登山队以大无畏的英雄气概，沿着珠穆朗玛峰北坡安全地登上了拔海8882米的珠穆朗玛峰的顶峰。这是我国登山运动员继攀登铁镜山、贡嘎山和慕士塔格山的胜利后所创造的又一项具有世界意义的新的成就。我们谨向中国登山队全体人员致以热烈的祝贺和崇高的敬意。
    喜马拉雅山的珠穆朗玛峰，是世界第一高峰。它的山体雄壮伟大，直入云霄，高耸于喜马拉雅山的群峰之中。喜马拉雅山区周围的各国人民，特别是中国和尼泊尔两国人民，对它有特别深厚的感情，世世代代歌颂和赞美着它。但是，这个雄伟的山峰，终年积雪，气候多变，空气稀薄，周围拥有巨大的冰川，人迹难至。不仅由于它是这样难于攀登的世界高峰，而且因为人类对它的地理、气候、生物等情况所知很少，因而世界各国登山家、探险家和科学家对它都有很大兴趣，把它同南极北极并称为世界第三极，不断前往攀登和考察。据记载，在1953年和1956年，有少数外国的登山家曾先后两次从坡度较缓的南坡登上过顶峰。外国登山家和探险家也多次地试图从它的北面攀登顶峰，但由于这一面地形复杂，比南坡更难攀登，因而都没有成功。中国登山队能够从它的北坡攀上顶峰，这在世界上还是第一次。尽管从北坡攀登顶峰是一件前人多次尝试而没有成功的异常困难的事情，但是，新中国的年青登山运动家们是不会在困难面前低头的。他们在党的总路线和大跃进的精神鼓舞和各方面的支援下，以中国人民勇敢而勤劳的英雄气概，战胜了冰川和高山多变的气候等种种困难，胜利地从北面登上了顶峰，完成了前人没有做到的事。这项具有世界意义的成功，不但是我国体育界的光荣，同样也是我们全国人民的光荣。为了保证这次登山的胜利，全国人民从多方面给以物质的支援和精神的鼓舞，我国冶金工业、化学工业、被服工业和食品工业为他们研究和制造了各种登山装备，特别是喜马拉雅山下的藏族同胞，给他们以非常热情的支援，这都是中国登山队能够创造这项世界成就的重要保证。这也是我们社会主义制度优越性的巨大胜利。现在，在山的南坡等地，也正有其他国家的登山家在向珠穆朗玛峰前进，我们预祝他们得到成功。
    我国登山队攀登珠穆朗玛峰的成功，对开展我国的群众性登山运动将会起巨大的鼓舞和推动的作用。我们国家的体育运动是为增强人民体质，锻炼人们的坚强斗争意志，为社会主义建设服务的。登山运动正符合这些目的。登山运动，需要越过各种复杂的地形，经受强烈的阳光照射和多变的气候，这就要求人们的身体具有极为良好的适应能力，需要有很强的体力和耐久力，并且要有互相帮助、团结友爱的集体主义精神；因此这项运动不仅能增强人的体质，还能培养人的共产主义道德品质。同时，我国是一个多山的国家，有三分之二的土地山脉纵横。每一处山脉都蕴藏着极其丰富的地下资源，需要我们去发现它、利用它。因此，培养登山运动员，广泛开展登山运动，对促进我国科学研究和建设事业也有着重大的意义。
    我国登山运动员登上珠穆朗玛峰，不但对我国体育事业的发展具有重大的鼓舞和推动的作用，同时对于全国人民的继续跃进也有巨大的鼓舞作用。因为它生动地证明了在伟大的党和毛泽东同志领导下，中国人民是无往不胜的。我国的登山运动只有短短五年的历史，但是由于党和人民的关怀与支持，运动员坚持政治挂帅，高度发扬了敢想敢干的共产主义风格和集体主义精神，这就使他们的体质和登山技术，能够极为迅速地发展和提高，因而取得攀登珠穆朗玛峰的胜利。这件事实证明，在我们的面前，前人还没有做到的事，我们也能够做到。让我们学习登上世界第一高峰——珠穆朗玛峰的登山队同志们的那种大无畏的英雄气概，在各个建设战线上掀起一个更大的跃进高潮！
