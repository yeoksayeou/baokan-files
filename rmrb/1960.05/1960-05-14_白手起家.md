Party Secretary's Notes:

    Starting from Scratch
    Wu Yuqing, First Secretary of the People's Commune Committee of Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Factory
    Our commune's factories' battle to seize a "May Full Red" is truly full of enthusiasm and excitement. So far, the commune has been able to produce more than 370 kinds of products, with a monthly output value of more than 1.2 million yuan. The people who created these achievements are those who were originally called housewives.
    Before the establishment of our commune, activities such as comparing unity and mutual assistance, comparing hygiene, comparing learning, and comparing diligence and thrift in managing the household… "Five Comparisons and Ten Goods" were carried out among family members, and temporary laundry groups were organized to serve the employees and production. However, they were still revolving around small families. Encouraged by the rapid progress of socialist construction and the overall Great Leap Forward, they were no longer satisfied with these jobs and eagerly requested to step out of their small families, participate in social labor, contribute bricks and tiles to the cause of socialist construction, and dedicate all their strength. But as some family members said:
   “Entangled in housework all day long, competing for the upstream, where to compete?” They strongly yearned to enter factories, shops, canteens, or kindergartens, to be a worker, salesperson, cook, or nursery worker. However, the trivial housework prevented them from freeing themselves. Chen Zhenshu, a family member of an employee, once mustered up the courage to work in a yarn factory, but because she had many children, the older ones needed care, and the younger ones still needed to be breastfed, she reluctantly worked for more than two months and had to resign from her job and return home. Finally, in the tide of vigorously running people's communes, they found a thorough path to liberation. They raised funds, donated tools, looked for factory sites, and vacated houses one after another. As soon as the factory site for the sewing factory was found, more than 20 family members carried their sewing machines in. Within a week, eight small factories such as woodworking, alcohol, shoemaking, and sewing were set up. At the same time, public canteens and nurseries were also set up, which immediately liberated many women's labor forces from trivial housework, and they entered various social labor lines such as state-owned factories, commune-run factories, canteens, and nurseries. When they built the factory and took the alcohol, chemical boards, wooden basins, shoes, and other products made with their own hands for the first time and reported the good news to the Party committee with gongs and drums, I don’t know how many people were moved to tears of happiness.
    Starting a factory from scratch, especially for women who have just walked out of their families, is indeed not an easy task. At that time, they faced difficulties such as no factory buildings, no equipment, no materials, and no technology. Although they had nothing in front of them, they had the determination to liberate themselves and did not feel discouraged. They firmly believed that under the leadership of the Party, everyone would unite and work hard with their own hands, and the factory could be built. "If there is no factory building, build it yourself, if there is no machine, work manually, if there is no good material, use waste material, if there is no technology, study hard, don't be a beggar, don't want a penny from the country," this is their battle slogan, and it is also the path they have taken. At the beginning, everyone worked hard for two months without wages to raise funds for the commune, and many people took the initiative to give their axes, planes, files, sledgehammers, and other tools, as well as water tanks, wooden basins, tables, benches, and other utensils to the commune for use. For example, the alcohol factory, which can now produce one ton of alcohol per day using foreign methods, was started by seven or eight women on the basis of five water tanks, two large pots, and one tin bucket. The liberated labor force is truly like an atomic explosion, with boundless power!
    After the vast number of housewives were freed from trivial housework and organized to participate in production, their boundless wisdom and talents, which were bound in the past, were also liberated and fully utilized. They were full of confidence and pride in their labor and creatively worked for socialist construction. After Wang Xiaoxian, a female worker in the sewing factory, participated in production, she mastered the production technology proficiently through tenacious study and hard research, arriving early for work and leaving late. Sometimes, she used her own clothes for experiments. In less than three months, she skillfully mastered the production technology and continued to improve and improve the technology, creating a new achievement of making three and a half sets of clothes a day, and became a model worker in the factory. The labor creation of housewives presents us with a magnificent picture and constitutes a touching poem; from them we see the dazzling light of communist spirit and communist style.

    白手起家
    中共郑州纺织机械厂人民公社委员会第一书记　吴玉清
    我们公社各个工厂夺取五月满堂红的一场激战，真是热气沸腾，人欢马嘶。到目前为止，公社已经能够生产三百七十多种产品，月产值达一百二十多万元。创造这些成绩的就是那些原来被称做家庭妇女的人们。
    在我们公社成立以前，在家属中虽然开展了比团结互助，比讲卫生，比学习，比勤俭持家……“五比十好”活动，组织了临时洗衣组，为职工为生产服务，但是她们仍然是在小家庭里转。在社会主义建设一日千里全面大跃进的鼓舞下，她们虽然不满足这些工作了，迫切地要求走出小家庭，参加社会劳动，为社会主义建设事业添砖盖瓦，贡献出一切力量。但正如有些家属们说：
  “整天缠在家务里，争上游，争到那里去呢？”她们强烈的向往着进工厂，进商店，进食堂或者幼儿园，作一个工人、售货员、炊事员或者保育员。可是繁琐的家务却使她们脱不开身。职工家属陈真书曾经鼓起勇气，去纱厂作工，但因孩子多，大的要人照顾，小的还要喂奶，勉强干了两个多月，不得不将工作辞掉，回到家里。终于，在大办人民公社的浪潮下，她们找到了彻底解放的道路。她们纷纷凑资金、献工具、找厂址、腾房子。缝纫厂的厂址刚找下，二十多个家属就把自己的缝纫机抬进去了，一周内办起了木工、酒精、制鞋、缝纫等八个小工厂。同时也跟着办起了公共食堂、托儿所，一下子从繁琐的家务中解放出好多妇女劳动力，分别进入了国营工厂、社办工厂、食堂、托儿所等各种社会劳动行列。当她们建成工厂第一次拿着用自己的双手做出的酒精、化学板、木盆、鞋子等产品，敲着锣鼓向党委报喜的时候，不知有多少人都激动的落下了幸福的眼泪。
    白手起家办工厂，特别是对于刚刚走出家庭的妇女来说，的确不是一件轻而易举的事。当时她们面临着没有厂房、没有设备、没有材料、没有技术的困难，尽管在她们面前的是一无所有，但是她们有了自己解放自己的决心，并没有灰心气馁。她们坚决相信在党的领导下，大家组织起来团结一致，用自己的双手辛勤劳动，工厂是可以办起来的。“没有厂房自己建，没有机器手工干，没有好料用废料，没有技术苦钻研，不当伸手派，不要国家一文钱”，这就是她们的战斗口号，也是她们走过来的道路。一开始大家苦干两个月不要工资，为公社筹集资金，许多人并将自己家里的斧、刨、锉刀、鎯头等工具和水缸、木盆、桌凳等用具主动拿给公社使用。像现在采用洋法生产，能够日产一吨酒精的酒精厂，就是由七、八个妇女在五口水缸、两口大锅、一只洋铁桶的基础上办起来的。解放了的劳动力，真像原子爆炸一样，威力无边！
    广大家庭妇女摆脱繁琐的家务，组织起来参加生产以后，过去她们被束缚着的无穷无尽的智慧和才能，也得到了解放和充分的发挥，她们对自己的劳动充满着信心和自豪，为社会主义建设创造性的劳动。缝纫厂的女工王小仙参加生产后，经过顽强学习，刻苦钻研，上班早来，下班晚走，有时拿着自己的衣服作试验，不到三个月的时间，就熟练地掌握了生产技术，并且不断改进与提高技术，创造了一天作成三套半衣服的新成绩，成了全厂的标兵。家庭妇女从事这些劳动创造，在我们面前展现出了一幅壮丽的图景，构成了一首感人的诗篇；从她们身上我们看到了共产主义精神、共产主义风格的耀眼的光芒。
