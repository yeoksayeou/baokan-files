Since the beginning of spring, the mass literacy campaign and spare-time education in Jilin Province, under the correct leadership of the Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee, has closely integrated with the current excellent situation of continuous leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, and has shown a new situation of "consolidating, persisting, improving quality, and continuing development." Sixteen people's communes, two hundred and forty-five management areas, and eighteen urban street offices and two hundred and eighty-four factories and mines throughout the province have all eliminated the remaining illiteracy among young and middle-aged people, achieving the historical task of "illiteracy-free communes" and "illiteracy-free factories and mines." This is a great happy event for the people of Jilin Province, just as the masses after becoming literate wrote in their poems: "The Party's grace is truly great, teaching the mute to speak, the illiterate can also open their eyes, miracles bloom everywhere." This is a great victory for the cultural revolution, a great victory for the Party's education policy, and a great victory for Mao Zedong's educational thought.

The emergence of such a new upsurge in the mass literacy movement in Jilin Province is by no means accidental. It was formed on the basis of the continuous great leap forward in 1958 and 1959, along with the upsurge of the mass movement of technological innovation and technological revolution. Now industrial and agricultural production is in a state of continuous leap forward, the technological revolution movement is developing in depth, and the urbanization movement of the people's communes has been universally carried out. The demands of workers and peasants for cultural emancipation are even more urgent, which has laid a favorable foundation for continuing to deepen the literacy and spare-time education. We should seize the current excellent situation, guide it accordingly, and push the mass literacy movement to a new climax, striving to basically achieve an illiteracy-free province in 1960. At the same time, literacy must be closely linked with spare-time elementary school, striking while the iron is hot, and accomplishing it in one go. All those who have become literate and have the conditions to study must enter the spare-time elementary school classes. This is done, firstly, to consolidate the achievements of literacy, and secondly, to expand and develop these achievements, popularize spare-time primary education, and continue to improve the cultural level of workers and peasants, so as to lay the foundation for the popularization of spare-time secondary and higher education.

The task of basically achieving an illiteracy-free province this year is arduous, but also possible. We now have a batch of typical examples of people's communes and factories and mines that have achieved illiteracy-free status. They have set an example for all communes and factories and mines that have not yet eliminated illiteracy, and can draw on the experience of other units to solve their own problems. Their experience tells us that it is entirely possible to completely eliminate the remaining illiteracy and achieve the goals of illiteracy-free communes, illiteracy-free factories and mines, illiteracy-free counties, illiteracy-free cities, illiteracy-free regions, and even reaching the goal of illiteracy-free provinces. The key is to earnestly learn from their experiences. That is, under the leadership of the Party committee, resolutely implement the principles of "combining with production, unified planning, flexibility and diversity, and teaching according to aptitude" and "learning more in slack seasons, learning less in busy seasons, learning flexibly in very busy seasons, and striving for uninterrupted learning," and universally promote the advanced method of phonetic literacy. These are their common and universal experiences that can be applied to all places where literacy is being carried out.

From the current point of view, the above-mentioned experiences have been applied to most of the urban and rural people's communes and factories and mines in the province, and it is believed that they will soon achieve the task of illiteracy-free status one after another.

At present, the literacy and spare-time education in some areas and units in Jilin Province have not been done very well. They have been carrying out literacy for several years, but the results are not very significant. Why is this the case? The main reasons are: first, production and learning are separated. They focus on production and forget about learning, or once production is busy, they stop learning. They are not acting in accordance with the spirit of "combining with production, unified planning" as instructed by the Central Committee, but acting in accordance with the opposite spirit; second, they do not consistently grasp the leadership, but "rush, empty, and slack," with a head but no tail, and a beginning but no end; third, they lack sensitivity to new things, or they do not learn and promote new experiences strongly enough. With these three reasons, it is difficult to do a good job in literacy and spare-time education. It should be recognized that eliminating illiteracy and popularizing spare-time education is an extremely arduous historical task, and without lofty aspirations and a lack of revolutionary drive, this historic task cannot be completed successfully.

Facts have proved that the Central Committee's instructions are very correct, and as long as we resolutely do it, we can achieve it. Is it true that "literacy learning cannot be combined with production"? Is it true that "it cannot be arranged"? Wrong. The problem is not that it cannot be combined with production, but that it is not combined with production. This point is properly combined by the comrades of the Party committees of the people's communes and factories and mines that have already reported success and are about to report success. The problem is not that it cannot be arranged, but whether it is arranged or not. This point does not exist at all in the Party committees of the people's communes and factories and mines that have already reported success and are about to report success. Some of them existed at the beginning, but they were quickly resolved. For example, in Dehui Town, there was this problem at the beginning, but the Party committee adopted a revolutionary attitude and successively convened enlarged meetings of the Party committee, meetings of leading cadres of various units, and mobilization meetings for the whole people to march towards culture, carrying out forceful ideological education work of "speaking (the role of learning in socialist construction), opposing (right-leaning thoughts in learning), debating (whether learning is possible when production is busy, and whether literacy can be carried out at high speed), expressing (expressing determination, formulating plans), and comparing (enthusiasm and action)," and the problem was quickly resolved.

What about the situation in those communes and factories and mines that have already reported success, regarding the so-called "arranging literacy and spare-time education will affect production"? Are some places busy while others are not? In fact, the objective conditions do not seem to be much different, and the answer should be sought from subjective initiative. In these illiteracy-free communes and illiteracy-free factories and mines, whether busy or idle, learning is always combined with production under the unified arrangement and overall deployment of the Party committee. Spring, summer, autumn, and winter, in cold and hot weather, they have truly achieved "evergreen in all seasons." Here, we may cite the example of two people's communes in Da'an County to illustrate that they have a total of 4,810 young and middle-aged illiterate farmers, and now all of them have eliminated illiteracy and have all participated in learning in various types of spare-time schools at all levels. The speed and success of their literacy movement have exceeded people's expectations. In summarizing the experience of production leap forward, the Party committee of the commune correctly pointed out that carrying out mass learning movements has played a great role in promoting the development of production. In the past, the masses in the Xin'an Management Area of the commune said, "The loess ridge does not produce grain," and at most, it produced no more than four *shi* of grain per hectare. In 1959, because the masses learned the "Agricultural Technology Textbook" in spare-time schools, they carried out timely early planting, rational close planting, deep plowing and careful cultivation, increased fertilizer and water, and strengthened field management according to the requirements of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture. As a result, the average yield per hectare reached eight *shi* and one *dou*, doubling the grain production. In the movement of technological innovation and technological revolution, the whole commune created and reformed more than 200 new-style agricultural tools. Among them, Sun Changfu, a member of the two management areas, actively studied technology after becoming literate and created a horse-drawn stubble cutting machine, which not only freed people from heavy physical labor, but also increased work efficiency by as much as five times. It has now been promoted throughout the commune. After improving their culture, the masses said, "Our minds are open, experience runs everywhere, everyone studies science, and technology is greatly improved." Therefore, our conclusion is that Party committees at all levels must strengthen leadership, resolutely implement the principles of "combining with production, unified planning, flexibility and diversity, and teaching according to aptitude" and "learning more in slack seasons, learning less in busy seasons, learning flexibly in very busy seasons, and striving for uninterrupted learning," and push the workers and peasants' mass literacy movement to a new climax, striving to basically achieve the glorious and great task of an "illiteracy-free province" this year.

In order to achieve the glorious and great historical task of achieving an illiteracy-free province in 1960, from now on, the experience of phonetic literacy must be universally promoted throughout the province. Promoting this experience is of decisive significance for Jilin Province to complete the literacy task in 1960. The important role of phonetic literacy is just as the Central Committee instructed: "It has solved two major problems in the literacy movement. One is that it has eliminated the phenomenon of massive relapse after literacy, and the other is that it ensures that farmers who know more than 1,000 characters can read phonetic books
and newspapers without a teacher, and constantly increase the number of characters they know in self-study. This greatly facilitates and accelerates the work of spare-time elementary school, and truly shows the atmosphere of the arrival of a rural cultural upsurge, with reading becoming a common practice in rural areas." Now, many people's communes and factories and mines in Jilin Province have promoted this experience. All those who use phonetics to carry out literacy have shown its superiority, eliminated a large number of young and middle-aged illiterate people in a short period of time, and achieved great results. Experience has proved that the method of phonetic literacy is a good method to eliminate illiteracy quickly, well, and economically, consolidate and expand the achievements of literacy, and accelerate the intellectualization of workers and peasants. Nanwaizi Management Area of Chalouhe People's Commune in Yongji County used the method of phonetic literacy to eliminate illiteracy that had not been eliminated for a long time. Their experience tells us that after mastering the tool of Chinese Pinyin and reaching the literacy standard, they can read a large number of phonetic reading materials and practice writing without being restricted by the number of characters they know; they can learn by themselves without a teacher, draw inferences from one example, teach and learn from each other, so that the mass learning movement can be carried out more easily, widely, and persistently. Phonetic literacy is a new thing. Like all new things, it will not be recognized and accepted by everyone at once at the beginning. In the process of promotion, it is impossible not to encounter the resistance of various conservative ideas and the opposition of old habits, but the new combat task requires us to promote it. Therefore, the struggle between the two ideas of quick, good, economical and slow, poor, and wasteful is inevitable. Therefore, Party committees at all levels must strengthen leadership, implement political command, boldly mobilize the masses, launch mass movements, and the experience of phonetic literacy will surely be promoted, and new things will surely defeat old things, and grow rapidly under the support of the Party, and play its great role.

Under the strengthened leadership of the Party, further implement the Party Central Committee's principles on spare-time education for workers and peasants, universally promote the experience of phonetic literacy, combine with the current industrial and agricultural production, boldly mobilize the masses, launch mass movements, muster revolutionary vigor, and the goal of basically achieving an illiteracy-free province in 1960 can certainly be achieved.

    工农群众扫盲运动的新任务
    吉林省委书记　富振声
    入春以来，吉林省群众性的扫盲学习运动和业余教育，在中央和省委的正确领导下，紧密结合当前工农业生产持续跃进的大好形势，已经出现了“巩固起来，坚持下去，提高质量，继续发展”的新局面。全省十六个人民公社、二百四十五个管理区和十八个城市街道、二百八十四个厂矿企业全部扫除青壮年中的剩余文盲，实现了无盲公社和无盲厂矿的历史任务。这是吉林省人民的大喜事，正如脱盲后的群众在诗歌中所写的那样：“党的恩情真伟大，教的哑叭会说话，文盲也能睁了眼，奇迹处处开红花。”这是文化革命的伟大胜利，党的教育方针的伟大胜利，是毛泽东教育思想的伟大胜利。
    吉林省出现这样一个群众扫盲运动的新高潮，完全不是偶然的。它是在1958年和1959年连续两年大跃进的基础上，随着技术革新和技术革命群众运动的高潮而形成的。现在工农业生产是持续跃进的局面，技术革命运动正在深入发展，城市人民公社化运动已经普遍地开展起来。工、农群众对文化翻身的要求更为迫切了，这对于继续深入开展扫盲和业余教育奠定了有利的基础。我们应当抓住当前的大好形势，因势利导，把群众性的扫盲运动推向新的高潮，力争在1960年内基本实现无盲省。同时，扫盲必须与业余高小紧密衔接，趁热打铁，一气呵成，必须做到凡是脱盲的而又有条件学习的一律进入业余高小班。这样做，一是为了巩固扫盲成果，二是为了扩大与发展这个成果，普及业余初等教育，继续提高工农群众的文化水平，为普及业余中等教育和高等教育打下基础。
    今年基本实现无盲省的任务是艰巨的，但也是可能的。我们现在有了一批实现无盲人民公社和无盲厂矿企业的典型例子，他们给所有尚未脱盲的公社和厂矿树立了榜样，可以吸取别的单位经验解决自己的问题了。他们的经验告诉我们，全部扫除剩余文盲，实现无盲公社、无盲厂矿、无盲县、无盲市、无盲地区乃至达到无盲省的目标是完全可以实现的。问题是要认真学习他们的经验。这就是要在党委的领导下，坚决贯彻执行“结合生产，统一安排，灵活多样，因材施教”和“闲时多学，忙时少学，大忙机动学，力争不间断”的原则，并且普遍地推广注音扫盲的先进办法。这些就是他们的共同的普遍的经验，可以应用于一切扫盲的地方。
    现在来看，上述经验已经运用到全省大多数的城乡人民公社和厂矿企业中，相信不久将会相继实现无盲的任务。
    吉林省现在还有部分地区和单位的扫盲和业余教育没有搞得很好，扫了几年文盲，但成绩并不十分显著。为什么会是这样呢？其主要原因，不过是：第一，生产与学习分家，抓了生产就忘了学习，或者生产一忙，就停止了学习。他们不是按照中央指示的“结合生产，统一安排”的精神办事，而是按照相反的精神去办事；第二，不是始终一贯地抓紧领导，而是“一轰、二空、三松”，有头无尾，有始无终；第三，对于新鲜事物缺乏敏感，或者对于新经验学习推广的不够有力。有了这样三条原因，就难于搞好扫盲和业余教育工作了。应当认识到扫除文盲和普及业余教育是个极为艰巨的历史任务，没有雄心大志，缺乏革命干劲，是不能出色地完成这个历史性的任务的。
    事实证明中央的指示是十分正确的，只要我们坚决去做就能做到。是不是“扫盲学习不能结合生产”了呢？是不是“安排不过来”了呢？错了。问题不在于不能结合生产，而在于不去结合生产，这一点在已经报捷和将要报捷的人民公社和厂矿企业党委的同志们是结合得恰当的。问题不在于安排不过来，而在于安排不安排，这一点在已经报捷和将要报捷的人民公社和厂矿企业党委中，有的根本不存在，有的开始是存在的，但是，很快就解决了。举例来说，在德惠镇那里，开始的时候是有这个问题的，但是党委采取了革命的态度，连续召开了党委扩大会议、各单位领导干部会议和全民向文化进军的动员大会，进行了“讲（学习对社会主义建设的作用）、反（在学习中的右倾思想）、辩（生产忙能否学习，扫除文盲可不可以高速度）、表（表示决心、制订规划）、比（干劲和行动）”这样有力的思想教育工作，问题很快地得到了解决。
    所谓“安排扫盲和业余教育就会影响生产”，那些已经报捷的公社和厂矿的情况又怎样解释呢？难道在一些地方忙在另一些地方就不忙吗？其实客观条件似乎都没有多大的差别，应该从主观能动性上去寻找答案。在这些无盲公社和无盲工矿那里，忙也罢，闲也罢，无论什么时候都是在党委的领导下，统一安排，全面部署，结合生产，坚持学习。春夏秋冬，寒来暑往，真正做到了“四季常青”。这里不妨列举大安县两家人民公社的例子来说明，他们那里共有农民青壮年文盲四千八百一十人，现在全部扫除文盲，并且全体参加了各级各类业余学校学习。他们扫盲运动进展之快，成绩之大，出乎人们意料之外。公社党委在总结生产跃进的经验中，正确地指出：开展群众性的学习运动，对于促进生产的发展起到了极大的作用。过去该社新安管理区的群众说：“黄土岗，不打粮”，每公顷最多不过产四石粮。而1959年由于群众在业余学校学习了“农业技术课本”，根据农业“八字宪法”的要求，进行了适时早播、合理密植、深翻细作、加肥加水和加强田间管理，结果平均每公顷产量达八石一斗，粮食翻一番。在技术革新和技术革命运动中，全社创造与改制了二百多件新式农具。其中两家管理区社员孙长富在脱盲以后，积极钻研技术，创造了马拉割槎机，不仅解除了笨重的体力劳动，而且提高工效达五倍之多，现已在全社推广。群众在提高文化以后说：“脑筋开了窍，经验到处跑，人人钻科学，技术大提高”。所以，我们的结论是，各级党委必须加强领导，坚决贯彻执行“结合生产，统一安排，灵活多样，因材施教”和“闲时多学，忙时少学，大忙机动学，力争不间断”的原则，把工农群众的扫盲运动推向新的高潮，力争今年基本实现“无盲省”的光荣伟大任务。
    为了在1960年实现无盲省的这一光荣伟大的历史任务，从现在起，必须在全省普遍推广注音扫盲的经验。推广这个经验，对于吉林省在1960年完成扫盲任务，具有决定性的意义。注音扫盲的重大作用，正如中央指示的那样：“解决了扫盲运动中的两个大问题，一个是消灭了扫过盲又大量回生的现象，另一个是保证了认识一千多字的农民可以无师自通地阅读注音书
  报，在自习中不断增加识字的数量。这就大大便利和加快了业余高小的工作，并且使农村读书成风，真正表现出了农村文化高潮到来的气象。”现在吉林省许多人民公社和厂矿企业推广了这个经验，凡是利用注音进行扫盲的，都显示了它的优越性，在短时期内扫除了大批的青壮年文盲，取得了巨大的成绩。经验证明，注音扫盲的办法，是多快好省地扫除文盲、巩固与扩大扫盲成果的好办法，是加速工农知识化的捷径。永吉县岔路河人民公社南崴子管理区，就是用注音扫盲的办法，扫除了长期以来不能扫除的文盲。他们的经验告诉我们，在掌握了汉语拼音这个工具达到扫盲标准之后，就可以不受识字数目的限制，大量阅读注音读物，练习写作；就可以无师自学，举一反三，互教互学，从而使群众性的学习运动更加容易广泛地、持久地开展起来。注音扫盲是个新东西，它同一切新生事物一样，开始不会一下子就被所有的人都能认识和接受的。在推广的过程中，不可能不遇到各种保守思想的抵触和旧习惯势力的反对，但是新的战斗任务要求我们非推广不可，于是多快好省同少慢差费的两种思想的斗争是不可避免的了。因此各级党委必须加强领导，实行政治挂帅，放手发动群众，大搞群众运动，注音扫盲的经验就一定能够推广起来，新生事物就一定能够战胜旧的事物，在党的扶植下迅速地成长起来，发挥它的巨大作用。
    在加强党的领导下，进一步贯彻执行党中央关于工农业余教育的原则，普遍推广注音扫盲的经验，结合当前的工农业生产，放手发动群众，大搞群众运动，鼓足革命干劲，在1960年内基本实现无盲省的目的就一定可以达到。
