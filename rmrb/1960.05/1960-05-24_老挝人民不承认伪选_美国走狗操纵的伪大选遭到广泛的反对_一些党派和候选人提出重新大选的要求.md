Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 21st: According to a recent report from "Pathet Lao News," the sham election manipulated and controlled by the U.S. imperialist lackey, the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests," has met with increasingly widespread opposition. Some Lao parties and ethnic minority candidates have also recently submitted protest letters demanding a re-election. Even Phoui Sananikone, leader of the Lao People's Union Party and former Prime Minister, said at the first session of the Lao National Assembly that "many petitions believe that the election does not comply with the election law." He requested the establishment of a committee to review the qualifications of members to deal with the matter.

The Lao People's Union Party holds nineteen of the fifty-nine seats in the new National Assembly. The remaining seats are almost entirely occupied by the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests."

"Pathet Lao News" also reported that Chao Samsanith, the Lao Minister of Interior, also admitted to the National Assembly on May 16th, while reporting on the new members of parliament, that this election has been opposed by the people. According to him, only sixteen members were elected "completely." The remaining forty-three members were "opposed," "prosecuted," and "strongly prosecuted."

After listing the above facts, "Pathet Lao News" pointed out, "All this proves that the recent election was fraudulent and illegal, and even the Kingdom Government cannot conceal this fact. Therefore, the Lao people will never recognize this election and firmly demand a re-election."

    老挝人民不承认伪选
    美国走狗操纵的伪大选遭到广泛的反对
    一些党派和候选人提出重新大选的要求
    新华社河内21日电　据“老挝爱国新闻”最近报道，美帝国主义走狗“保卫国家利益委员会”把持和操纵的伪大选遭到愈来愈广泛的反对。老挝一些党派和少数民族的候选人最近也提出了抗议书，要求重新举行大选。连老挝人联合党的领袖、前首相培·萨纳尼空也在老挝国会第一次会议上说，“许多请愿书认为大选不符合选举法”。他要求成立议员资格审查委员会来处理这件事。
    老挝人联合党在新国民议会五十九席中有十九席。其余的席位差不多全部都给“保卫国家利益委员会”霸占了。
    “老挝爱国新闻”还报道说，老挝王国内务部大臣昭·松萨尼特在5月16日向国会报告新议员的情况时也承认，这次大选遭到人民的反对。按照他的说法，只有十六名议员是“完全”当选的。其余的四十三名议员都“受到反对”、“起诉”和“强硬的起诉”。
    “老挝爱国新闻”在列举上述事实后指出，“这一切证明，最近举行的大选是骗人的，非法的，甚至王国政府也不能掩盖这个事实。因此，老挝人民决不承认这一次大选，并且坚决要求重新选举。”
