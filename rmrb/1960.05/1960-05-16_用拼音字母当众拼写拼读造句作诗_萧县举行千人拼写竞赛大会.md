    Xiao County Holds a Thousand-Person Spelling Contest

    (Our Report) Xiao County, Anhui Province, recently held its first thousand-person spelling contest in Huangkou Commune to conduct a major review and evaluation of the phonetic literacy work of the past six months. The participants included the heads of propaganda departments from the county's nineteen communes, the cultural and educational secretaries of the major production brigades, literacy teachers, and outstanding learners who have emerged on the literacy front. Huang Peng, head of the Research and Promotion Division of the Chinese Written Language Reform Committee, and the Anhui Province Work-Study Education Delegation, composed of representatives from various counties (cities), also attended the conference. The conference had a novel content, diverse forms, and was lively and dynamic.

    At the beginning of the test, representatives from the Chinese Written Language Reform Committee and the Anhui Province Work-Study Education Delegation, etc., gave arbitrary questions, called out numbers for the test-takers, and the students used Pinyin alphabet on the spot for spelling, pronunciation, sentence making, poetry writing, dictionary checking, and Mandarin recitation. The students read and wrote in public, with accurate pronunciation and fluency. Zhao Jinglin, a sixteen-year-old seal-carving apprentice at the Huangkou Commune Commercial Service Department, had studied culture for several years without ever consolidating his knowledge. After learning the phonetic alphabet last year, he solidified his recognition of Chinese characters and is now reading at the first year of junior high school level. In this spelling contest, he composed a poem in just four minutes: "Everyone's enthusiasm soars to the clouds, the good news of cotton bumper harvest spreads, we want to turn it over several times per mu, and strive to present gifts to Beijing." Through the spelling contest, Huangkou, Majing, and Longcheng communes were rated as advanced units, and twenty-one spelling champions, eighty-three pacesetters, and seven hundred and fourteen skilled individuals were selected, cultivating a backbone for Xiao County to further carry out cultural learning movements and comprehensively promote Mandarin in the future.

    In recent years, in order to meet the needs of the broad masses of people, the Xiao County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China has actively carried out cultural learning and literacy movements. Since 1958, with the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, a high tide of eliminating illiteracy has been set off. More than 160,000 people in the county have shaken off illiteracy, accounting for more than 90% of the total number of illiterate young and middle-aged people. In 1959, the county focused on consolidating cultural learning, but still 28% of the students experienced relapse into illiteracy. In April 1959, the county carried out phonetic literacy pilot work, and in November, the county launched a phonetic literacy learning movement. In just a few months, the number of people participating in learning increased from more than 190,000 to more than 250,000.

    Now, all young and middle-aged people in the county have been completely liberated from illiteracy, and more than 25,000 students have consolidated their learning results after studying phonetic literacy and have served as accountants, civil school teachers, technicians, etc., becoming cultured laborers.

    In the phonetic literacy work, the Party committee secretaries at all levels in Xiao County personally serve as principals and class teachers of civil schools, regularly inspect and study teaching work. In order to enable students to participate in spare-time school learning immediately after becoming literate, each production team in the county now runs one to two higher primary schools and junior high schools.

    用拼音字母当众拼写拼读造句作诗 
    萧县举行千人拼写竞赛大会
    本报讯　安徽省萧县，最近在黄口公社举行首次千人拼写竞赛大会，对半年来注音扫盲工作进行了一次大检阅，大评比。参加大会的有全县十九个公社的宣传部长，各大队文教书记、扫盲教师以及在扫盲战线上涌现出来的学习积极分子。中国文字改革委员会研究推广处黄朋处长和由各县（市）代表组成的安徽省工农业余教育参观团也参加了这个大会。这次大会内容新颖，形式多样，生动活泼。
    测验开始时，由中国文字改革委员会和安徽省工农业余教育参观团等代表们任意出题，叫号受试，学员当场用拼音字母进行拼写、拼读、造句、作诗、查字典、普通话朗诵等活动。学员们当众读、写，发音准确，流利熟练。黄口公社商业服务部十六岁刻字徒工赵景林，学习了几年文化一直没有巩固下来，去年学习注音字母后，认得的汉字就巩固了，现在已读到初中一年级。他在这次拼写竞赛大会上仅用了四分钟就作出一首诗：“人人干劲冲云端，棉花丰收捷报传，每亩要它翻几番，力争北京把礼献”。通过拼写竞赛，共评出黄口、马井、龙城三个公社为先进单位，并评选了二十一名拼写健将，八十三名标兵，七百一十四名能手，为萧县今后进一步开展文化学习运动和全面推广普通话培养了骨干。
    几年来，为了满足广大人民的需要，中共萧县县委积极地开展了文化学习和扫盲运动。1958年以来，随着工农业生产大跃进，掀起了扫除文盲的高潮。全县有十六万多人摆脱了文盲状态，占青壮年文盲总数90％以上。1959年全县抓紧了文化学习的巩固工作，但仍有28％的学员有回生复盲现象。1959年4月，全县进行注音扫盲试点工作，11月全县开展了注音扫盲学习运动。在短短的几个月内，参加学习的人数由十九万多人增加到二十五万多人。
    现在，全县青壮年已全部扫除文盲，并有二万五千多名学员经过注音扫盲学习后，巩固了学习成绩，分别担任了会计、民校教师、技术员等工作，成为有文化的劳动者。
    在注音扫盲工作中，萧县各级党委书记都亲自担任民校校长和班主任，定期检查和研究教学工作。为了使学员脱盲后立即参加业余学校学习，现在全县各公社每个生产队都办起了一至二所高小和初级中学。
