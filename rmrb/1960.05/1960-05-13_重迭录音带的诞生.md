    The Birth of the Superimposed Recording Tape
    April 27th was like a festive day at our Yuncheng Broadcasting Station, full of excitement. People were celebrating the successful trial production of the superimposed tape recorder. As the superimposed tape recorder began broadcasting, everyone listened intently to the five different sounds emanating from the same tape at different times, each sound clear and loud. Someone exclaimed joyfully, "Great! Now one tape can do the work of five, and we don't have to worry about running out of tapes anymore!"
    The researcher of the superimposed tape recorder was none other than Ding Chunwu, a technician at our station. Ding Chunwu, a member of the Communist Youth League, was most troubled by the shortage of magnetic tapes in his work. This time, he was determined to make a "breakthrough" on this difficult problem. He thought: Wouldn't it be great if multiple tracks could be recorded simultaneously on one tape? He pondered this for five days and nights. Later, he happened to see in a foreign magazine that a factory had achieved eight-track superimposed recording on a one-inch wide tape. This news greatly inspired him, so he began experimenting on six-millimeter recording tapes.
    During the experiment, he encountered many difficulties. The machine parts didn't fit, so he disassembled and reassembled them repeatedly. After eight days, he finally succeeded in recording two tracks on one tape. Although the sound was not very good, Ding Chunwu's confidence grew even stronger.
    The fifth experiment began. He hoped it would be successful this time, but the opposite happened. As soon as the motor started, there was a "snap" sound, and the recording head broke. Just at this critical moment, discouraging remarks also came. Some people said that he was trying to run before he could walk. At this time, the Party branch gave him great encouragement and mobilized the entire station's technicians to tackle the technical challenges together. As a result, the superimposed tape recorder was successfully tested. Yuncheng Broadcasting Station Correspondence Group

    重迭录音带的诞生
    4月27日这一天，我们运城广播站里就像办喜事似的，热闹极了。人们正在欢庆重迭录音机的试制成功。重迭录音机播音开始了，大伙一动不动地听着一条磁带上在不同的时间发出五种不同的声音，每种声音都清晰宏亮。不知道是谁高兴地说：“嗨！这回可好了，一条磁带可以顶五条用，再也不用为缺少磁带而耽心了”。
    研究重迭录音机的不是别人，正是咱们站的技术员丁春武。丁春武是个共青团员，在工作中最使他头痛的是磁带不够用。这次他下了决心，一定要在这个难题上做做“文章”。他想：要是能在一条录音带上同时进行多路录音，该有多好。为这事，他整整想了五天五夜。后来，偶然在一本外国杂志上看到了有一个厂在一寸宽的磁带上进行了八路重迭录音。这个消息给他很大启发，于是他开始在六公厘的录音带上进行试验。
    试验当中碰到了很多困难，机器零件不合适，拆了装，装了拆，经过八天，终于试验成一条磁带录两路音，虽然声音不好听，可是丁春武的信心更大了。
    第五次试验开始了。他希望这次能成功，但是事情恰恰相反，机器马达刚一转动，只听见嚓的一声，录音磁头就坏了。就在这节骨眼上，风凉话也来了。有人说还不会走就想跑。正在这时，党支部给了他很大鼓励。并发动全站技术员大会师，解决了技术难关。结果重迭录音机就这样试验成功了。　运城广播站通讯组
