Xinhua News Agency, May 25th Dispatch from New York: The U.S. government's sabotage of the Four-Power Summit Conference has greatly pleased Wall Street stock speculators and arms factory owners. Stock prices, particularly those of concerns producing missiles, aircraft, and military electronic equipment, have risen sharply recently. On the New York stock market on the 24th, the stocks that rose the most were those of Lockheed Aircraft Corporation, North American Aviation, and General Telephone & Electronics, among others.

The "New York Times" financial commentator, Ratte, wrote smugly, "This week, after enduring several months of disappointment and confusion, bullish stockbrokers have regained their spirits. Judging from the rising stock market, recent events are ultimately good news."

"U.S. News & World Report" magazine believes that the failure of the Four-Power Summit Conference is an "economic stimulant."

The "New York Post" economic commentator, Porter, stated without concealment that after the U.S. sabotaged the summit conference, "companies that make fortunes from arms production" no longer worry about economic decline.

"Business Week" wrote: "The failure of the summit will have a very real impact on business," "You can see Wall Street betting on this this week: missiles and missile bases will increase." This weekly further exposed the desire of Wall Street financiers to profit from war. It said, "No matter how quickly the new appropriation bill is approved, defense production (referring to military production) cannot suddenly increase significantly; only a crisis—most likely the Berlin crisis—can cause rapid and significant changes in business."

    艾森豪威尔破坏四国会议符合垄断资本利益
    华尔街股票牌价扶摇直上
    投机商军火老板趾高气扬
    据新华社25日讯　纽约消息：美国政府破坏了四国政府首脑会议，使华尔街的股票投机商和军火工厂的老板们大为高兴。股票的牌价，特别是生产导弹、飞机和军用电子设备的康采恩的股票牌价最近大大上涨。在24日的纽约股票市场中，上涨得最多的就是洛克希德飞机公司、北美飞机公司和通用电话和电子公司等的股票。
    “纽约时报”金融评论员腊特得意地写道，“这个星期，（纽约股票市场）在经受了好几个月的失望和困惑之后，看涨的股票经纪人重新振作了精神。从上涨的股票市场看来，最近的事件归根到底是个好消息。”
    “美国新闻与世界报道”杂志认为，四国政府首脑会议没有开成是“经济上的兴奋剂”。
      “纽约邮报”经济评论员波特尔毫不隐讳地表示，在美国破坏了首脑会议后，“靠军备生产发财的公司”就不耽心经济下降了。
      “商业周刊”写道：“最高级会议的失败将对商业有非常实际的影响”，“你可以看到华尔街本周在这方面打赌：导弹和导弹基地将会增加”。这家周刊还进一步暴露了华尔街的金融家想发战争财的面目。它说，“不管新的拨款法案能多快地批准，防务方面的生产（指军事生产）不能突然大大增加，只有危机——很可能是柏林危机——才能使商业发生迅速而显著的变化。”
