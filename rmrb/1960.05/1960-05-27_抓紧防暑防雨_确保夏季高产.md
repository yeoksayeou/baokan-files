Xinhua News Agency, May 26th - Beijing factories and mines are actively preparing for heatstroke and rain prevention to ensure sustained leaps in production during the summer high temperatures and rainstorms.

    Since February and March, the metallurgical system factories have conducted professional maintenance on related factory buildings, drainage pipelines, and insulation and ventilation equipment in high-temperature workshops. They have also conducted physical examinations for workers engaged in high-temperature operations. The construction department has formulated rain prevention measures for foundation projects and cast-in-place and precast reinforced concrete projects, requiring construction sites to complete foundation or structural roof projects in sections and buildings in advance, reducing workers' exposure to the sun or rain. The transportation department has begun to rush transport materials needed for the rainy season in advance so that factories can continue production as usual during the rainy season.

    A notable feature of Beijing's heatstroke and rain prevention work this year is its integration with the mass technical revolution and the improvement of workers' working conditions. Many factories and mines, having already achieved the "fourizations" of casting, forging, and loading/unloading, continue to innovate technology, reduce workshop temperatures, keep operators away from heat sources, and shift from open-air operations to indoor operations.

    Shanghai Factories and Enterprises
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 26th - Many factories and enterprises in Shanghai have prepared for this year's heatstroke prevention and cooling work. Employees have expressed their determination to overcome the high temperatures, seize high yields, and ensure the realization of this year's leap forward.

    Shanghai factories began preparing for heatstroke prevention and cooling early this year. Many factories started repairing ventilation and insulation equipment in February. Many factories also launched the technical innovation movement, mobilizing the masses to manufacture motors and fans themselves, solving the problem of heatstroke prevention equipment. Factories in the metallurgy, machinery, textile, glass, and enamel systems have conducted general inspections of existing ventilation equipment, mist fans, and air conditioning equipment, and adjusted the location of these devices as needed.

    The metallurgical system is the focus of heatstroke prevention and cooling. Factories under the Municipal Metallurgical Bureau have built new sunshades and rest rooms for workers engaged in high-temperature operations and prepared refreshing drinks for the summer. Steel Plants No. 1, No. 3, and No. 5 in Shanghai have conducted physical examinations for workers engaged in high-temperature operations, and those who are not suitable for high-temperature operations will be transferred to other jobs.

    Tianjin Factories and Enterprises
    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, May 26th - Tianjin factories and enterprises are actively preparing heatstroke prevention and cooling equipment and materials to ensure normal production during the summer.

    The Tianjin Municipal Metallurgical Industry Bureau is rushing to manufacture more than 400 motors for cooling, some of which have been distributed to the smelting, refractory, and other high-temperature workshops under its jurisdiction. The commercial sector has prepared a large number of heatstroke prevention and cooling materials, with natural ice alone doubling compared to last year. Many factories and enterprises are taking measures to vigorously promote natural ventilation, relocate heat sources, and isolate heat sources based on their own equipment conditions. Many high-temperature operation units have set up insulation walls and fan sprays. Some steel production units have adopted cooling measures such as setting up asbestos boards, asbestos curtains, and water curtains in front of the furnace openings.

    Anshan Iron and Steel Complex Factories and Mines
    Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, May 26th - The Anshan Iron and Steel Complex factories and mines are mobilizing the masses to vigorously carry out heatstroke prevention and cooling work, vowing to seize high yields in the summer.

    A large number of heat insulation equipment such as water curtains and water screens have been installed in the high-temperature operation areas of the steelmaking, ironmaking, and steel rolling plants, and sprayers and cyclone-type cooling have been implemented. Various factories and mines have taken measures to strengthen the health care work of workers. Many factories and mines such as steelmaking, ironmaking, chemical, and refractory are vigorously organizing the supply of refreshing beverages such as soy milk, mung bean soup, filtered water, and iced fruit to ensure that employees have enough refreshing beverages in the summer.

    Closely integrating heatstroke prevention and cooling work with the technical innovation and technical revolution movement is an effective method widely adopted by the Anshan Iron and Steel Complex factories and mines. In the past, more than 100 people per shift had to operate at high temperatures to cut steel plates in the No. 2 Medium Plate Plant. Now, the creation of an automatic shearing machine has improved operating conditions and increased work efficiency by more than six times.

    Chongqing Iron and Steel Plants
    Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, May 26th - Chongqing's iron and steel plants, closely combined with the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, fully mobilize the masses to vigorously carry out heatstroke prevention and cooling work, and have solved many major problems related to cooling.

    In just over a month, the Chongqing No. 3 Iron and Steel Plant has achieved more than 110 innovation projects in heatstroke prevention and cooling. Among these projects, many are key to cooling. For example, in the past, the entire process of closing the taphole, desulfurizing, and removing slag from the iron melting furnace relied on manual operation, and the temperature was very high. After they successfully tested the automatic taphole closing of the iron melting furnace and manufactured a qigong desulfurization mixer, the high-temperature operation conditions for workers were greatly improved. Workers at the Ge Laoxi Converter Steelmaking Plant of Chongqing Iron and Steel made their own new-style spray cooling equipment, which made the spray uniform and the cooling effect very good.

    While vigorously carrying out cooling innovations, various factories have also generally inspected and repaired the original cooling equipment.

    抓紧防暑防雨　确保夏季高产
    北京各厂矿
    据新华社26日讯　北京市许多厂矿企业正积极进行防暑防雨的准备工作，保证夏季高温和暴雨期间生产持续跃进。
    冶金系统各厂早从2、3月起，就对有关厂房、下水管道和高温车间的隔热、通风设备装置等进行了专业检修，并且给从事高温操作的工人作了身体检查。建筑部门已经制订出基础工程及现制、预制钢筋混凝土工程等方面的防雨措施，要求各工地提前分段分栋完成基础或结构屋面工程，减少工人在露天暴日或暴雨下作业。交通运输部门已经开始提前抢运雨季需要的物资，使工厂在雨季能照常生产。
    北京市今年防暑防雨工作的显著特点，是同大闹技术革命、改善工人劳动条件结合了起来。许多工矿企业在已经实现铸工、锻工、装卸“四化”的基础上，继续革新技术，降低车间温度，使操作工人远离热源，由露天操作转为室内操作。
    上海工厂企业
    新华社上海26日电　上海市许多工厂企业单位，已经作好了今年的防暑降温准备工作。职工们纷纷提出，一定要战胜高温，夺取高产，保证实现今年的跃进。
    今年上海各厂的防暑降温准备工作动手早，2月份不少厂就开始检修通风、隔热设备。许多工厂还在技术革新运动中，发动群众自己制造马达、风扇，解决了防暑设备。冶金、机械、纺织、玻璃、搪瓷等系统各厂，对原有的通风设备、喷雾风扇、冷气设备等，都进行了普遍检查，并且根据需要调整了这些设备的设置地点。
    冶金系统是防暑降温的重点。市冶金局所属各厂，已为高温操作的工人新搭了凉棚和休息室，准备了暑天用的清凉饮料。上钢一厂、上钢三厂、上钢五厂等几个钢铁厂，对高温操作的工人已普遍进行了体格检查，对个别不适于高温操作的工人，将统一安排调作别的工作。
    天津工厂企业
    据新华社天津26日电　天津市工厂企业正在积极准备防暑降温的设备、物资，保证暑期生产正常进行。
    天津市冶金工业局正在赶制四百多台降温用的马达，有的已经分发给所属各冶炼、耐火等高温车间使用；商业部门准备了大批防暑降温物资，仅天然冰一项就比去年增加了一倍。许多工厂企业根据自己的设备条件，正在采取措施大搞自然通风、热源外迁和隔开热源等。不少高温作业单位已经设置了隔热墙、风扇喷雾。有的钢铁生产单位采取了在炉口前设置石棉板、石棉帘、水幕等降温措施。
    鞍钢各厂矿
    据新华社鞍山26日电　鞍钢各厂矿正在发动群众大搞防暑降温工作，誓夺夏季高产。
    各炼钢、炼铁、轧钢厂的高温作业地区，目前已安装了大量水幕、水帘等隔热设备，并且实行了喷雾器和旋风式的降温。各厂矿采取措施，加强了工人的卫生保健工作。炼钢、炼铁、化工、耐火等许多厂矿，都在大力组织豆浆、绿豆汤、过滤水、冰果等清凉饮料的供应工作，保证职工在夏季有足够的清凉饮料。
    紧密结合技术革新和技术革命运动开展防暑降温工作，是鞍钢各厂矿普遍采用的有效方法。第二中板厂剪断钢板，过去每班要一百多人在高温下操作；现在创造出自动剪断机，改善了操作条件，提高工作效率六倍多。
    重庆各钢铁厂
    据新华社重庆26日电　重庆市各钢铁厂紧密结合技术革新和技术革命运动，充分发动群众，大搞防暑降温工作，已经解决了很多有关降温的重大问题。
    重庆第三钢铁厂在短短的一个多月中，实现了防暑降温的革新项目一百一十多项。在这些项目中，有很多是降温关键。例如，过去化铁炉从堵眼、脱硫到扒渣，全靠人工操作，温度很高；他们试验成功化铁炉自动堵眼和制成了气功脱硫搅拌器以后，大大改善了工人高温作业的条件。重钢葛老溪转炉炼钢厂工人自己制了新式喷雾降温设备，使喷雾均匀，降温效果很好。
    在大搞降温革新的同时，各厂还对原有的降温设备普遍作了检查和修理。
