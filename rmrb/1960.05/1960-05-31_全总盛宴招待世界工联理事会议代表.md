Xinhua News Agency, May 30th. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) hosted a grand banquet at the Beijing Hotel tonight to entertain delegates attending the 11th Council Meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) to be held in Beijing.

The WFTU President, Giuseppe Di Vittorio (Italy), Vice-Presidents Benoît Frachon (France), Vicente Lombardo Toledano (Mexico), Herbert Warnke (German Democratic Republic), S.A. Dange (India), František Zupka (Czechoslovakia), Loga-Sowiński (Poland), and Enrique Pastorino (Uruguay), as well as WFTU Executive Committee members, council members, invited representatives, and WFTU staff attended the banquet tonight.

The banquet hall was filled with an atmosphere of friendship and joy. Chinese trade union workers and friends from more than forty countries and regions across five continents gathered together, engaging in cordial conversations. The guests frequently raised their glasses to toast the further development of the world labor movement and the unity and friendship of the working class around the world.

Liu Ningyi, President of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, spoke at the beginning of the banquet. He extended, on behalf of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the Chinese working class, a heartfelt welcome to friends from various countries who came to China to attend the 11th Council Meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions.

In his speech, Liu Ningyi expressed his full support for the Soviet Union's stern position against U.S. imperialism's aggression and strongly condemned the crimes of U.S. imperialism in sabotaging the Four-Power Summit Conference. He said that now, people all over the world have further recognized that U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the people of the world and the most ferocious enemy of the working class around the world. People of all countries are further uniting to oppose imperialism and defend world peace, for the interests of national democracy and the interests of the working class of all countries. Even in places where U.S. imperialism's rule is most stringent, such as South Korea, Japan, and Turkey, the people are surging forward in action. The overall world situation is an excellent situation where the East wind continues to prevail over the West wind. U.S.-led imperialism and its running dogs have done all sorts of bad things and their days are numbered. The world belongs to the working class and the laboring people. The working class of the whole world unites and marches forward courageously for our victory.

WFTU President Giuseppe Di Vittorio, in his speech, first expressed his warm respect to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and President Liu Ningyi. Then, he enthusiastically praised China's construction achievements. Di Vittorio said, "Here, I have personally seen that communism is the youth of mankind. The Chinese people are full of vitality, great enthusiasm, and abundant perseverance, and are enthusiastically and happily building their new life."

Di Vittorio said that the WFTU Council meeting is about to be held. This meeting is being held at a critical moment, as imperialist and militarist forces are attacking the cause of world peace. The central theme of this meeting is to oppose imperialism and militarist forces and to defend world peace.

He said that we are full of confidence in building a new society. We firmly believe that the struggle of the people of colonial countries for national independence and the class struggle of the working class in capitalist countries will surely be victorious.

Also present at the banquet were Liu Changsheng, Zhu Xuefan, Xu Zhizhen, Chen Shaomin, and Li Jiebo, Vice-Presidents of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Secretariat Secretaries Li Zaiwen, Zhang Xiuzhu, and Kang Yonghe, as well as the heads of various departments of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, various industrial trade unions, and the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions.

After the banquet, the Chinese film "Ten Thousand Waters, Thousand Mountains" was shown.

    中华全国总工会主席刘宁一在宴会开始时讲话。他代表中华全国总工会和中国工人阶级，向前来我国出席世界工联第十一次理事会会议的各国朋友们表示衷心的欢迎。
    刘宁一在讲话中表示完全支持苏联反对美帝国主义侵略的严正立场，并且严厉谴责了美帝国主义破坏四国政府首脑会议的罪行。他说，现在，全世界人民更加认清了美帝国主义是全世界人民最凶恶的敌人，是全世界工人阶级最凶恶的敌人。各国人民为了反对帝国主义和保卫世界和平，为了民族民主的利益和各国工人阶级的利益，更进一步地团结起来了。就是在美帝国主义统治最严密的地方，如南朝鲜、日本、土耳其，人民也汹涌澎湃地行动起来。整个世界形势是东风继续压倒西风的大好形势，以美国为首的帝国主义及其走狗们，他们坏事做尽了，寿命不长了。世界是属于工人阶级和劳动人民的。全世界工人阶级团结起来，为我们的胜利奋勇进军。
