Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 24th: Japanese traitorous Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi is persisting in being hostile to the people. This morning, he publicly demanded that his cabinet use all its power to get the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty "ratified" by both houses of the Diet. Ignoring the unanimous demands of the entire country, he said at a cabinet meeting that he had no intention of resigning nor any plans to dissolve the Diet.
	He even went so far as to say that the government should not bow to external pressure from the people and the newspapers.
	According to Tokyo Radio, the Kishi Nobusuke group is attempting to force the Senate to "pass" a proposal to extend the session by fifty days on May 25 or 26, just as they did in the House of Representatives.
	To this end, Kishi Nobusuke also told his cabinet members that he would meet with the leaders of the various opposition factions within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party in the hope of obtaining their "cooperation" to end the current political crisis.
	The Kishi Nobusuke group is frequently engaging with various factions within the Liberal Democratic Party in an attempt to gain their support.
	According to tonight's "Nihon Keizai Shimbun," Kishi Nobusuke held talks with Takeo Miki, one of the leaders of the anti-mainstream faction of the Japanese ruling party, today. Miki expressed his doubts as to whether the political situation could be "normalized" according to the course envisioned by Kishi Nobusuke.
	According to the newspaper, Kishi Nobusuke stated during his meeting with Miki that he would never resign nor dissolve the Diet, attempting to allow the new "Security Treaty" to be "automatically ratified."
	After his meeting with Kishi Nobusuke, Miki said that he and Kishi Nobusuke were "still very far apart in their assessment of the situation."
	According to Kyodo News, Kishi Nobusuke also held talks with Ichiro Kono today on the issue of "settling the situation." However, Kono stated that "party issues will be dealt with later"; the "talks ended unhappily."
	In addition, on the orders of Kishi Nobusuke, Koijiro Ishii, chairman of the Executive Council of the ruling party, held talks with Tanzan Ishibashi, the leader of the anti-Kishi faction.
	According to the "Nihon Keizai Shimbun," Ishii suggested to Ishibashi during the meeting that he take a more "cautious" attitude towards the current political crisis. He "criticized" Ishibashi's strong anti-Kishi stance.
	According to reports, Ishibashi reiterated his attitude in response to Ishii's suggestion: there is no other way to save the crisis except for Kishi Nobusuke to resign now.
	According to the "Yomiuri Shimbun," Kishi Nobusuke invited Kenzo Matsumura to meet with him yesterday, but was refused by Matsumura.
	According to Japanese newspapers today, Kishi Nobusuke also met with Banboku Ohno, Koijiro Ishii, Hayato Ikeda, and Eisaku Sato, among others, within the Liberal Democratic Party yesterday, and stated that he would force the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty to be "ratified" by the Diet. The newspaper said that Kishi Nobusuke "obtained approval."

    岸信介坚持与人民为敌到底
    悍然叫嚷无意辞职和不愿意解散国会
    表示要全力促使日美条约得到“批准”
    新华社24日讯　东京消息：日本卖国首相岸信介与人民为敌到底，今天上午竟公然要求他的内阁以全部力量来使日美军事同盟条约得到国会两院的“批准”。他在内阁会议上不顾日本举国一致的要求，说他既无意辞职，也没有解散国会的任何计划。
    他甚至于说什么政府不应向来自人民和报纸的外部压力低头。
    据东京电台透露，岸信介集团企图在本月25日或26日像他们在众议院所作所为一样，强使参议院“通过”延长会期五十天的提案。
    为此，岸信介还对他的内阁阁员说，他将同执政的自由民主党内部的各反对派领袖会晤，希望获得他们的“合作”来结束目前的政治危机。
    岸信介集团正在向自由民主党内各派系频繁活动，企图取得他们的支持。
    据今晚的“日本经济新闻”报道，岸信介今天同日本执政党反主流派首脑之一三木武夫进行了会谈。三木表示，他怀疑按照岸信介设想的方针是否能够使政局“正常化”。
    据报纸说，岸信介在同三木会晤时，表示他决不辞职，也不解散国会，企图使新“安全条约”“自动得到批准”。
    三木在同岸信介会谈以后说，他和岸信介之间“在形势的判断上还有很大的距离”。
    据共同社报道，岸信介今天还同河野一郎就“收拾局势”问题举行了会谈。但是，河野表示“党内问题以后再处理”；“会谈不欢而散”。
    另外，按照岸信介的命令，执政党总务会会长石井光次郎同反岸派领袖石桥湛三进行了会谈。
    据“日本经济新闻”报道，在会晤时，石井建议石桥对目前的政治危机采取比较“慎重的”态度。他“批评”石桥的强烈的反岸态度。
    据报道，石桥在答复石井的建议时重申他的态度：除了岸信介现在辞职来挽救危机外，没有别的办法。
    据“读卖新闻”报道，昨天岸信介曾经邀请松村谦三同他会谈，但是遭到松村的拒绝。
    据日本报纸今天报道，岸信介在昨天还同自由民主党内的大野伴睦、石井光次郎、池田勇人和佐藤荣作等人会谈，表示要强使日美军事同盟条约获得国会“批准”。报纸说，岸信介“取得了赞同”。
