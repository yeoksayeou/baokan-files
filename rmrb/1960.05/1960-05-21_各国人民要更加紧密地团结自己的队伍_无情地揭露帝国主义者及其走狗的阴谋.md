People of All Countries Must Unite Their Ranks More Closely
Ruthlessly Expose the Conspiracies of Imperialists and Their Lackeys
Speech by Soviet Ambassador to the People's Republic of China, Chervonenko

Dear Comrades, Friends, and Brothers!

At the very moment when the Soviet people are expressing their angry protest against the conspiracies of the American warmongers, the residents of Beijing and the entire Chinese people are demonstrating their fraternal solidarity with the Soviet people and the people of all countries in the socialist camp, expressing their unwavering will and determination to crush the sinister conspiracies of the US imperialists. The unbreakable alliance of our countries is a powerful guarantee of world peace, and the people of our countries have stood, stand, and will always stand together, shoulder to shoulder, to defend the sacred cause of peace.

I would like to express my gratitude to the various organizations that led today's grand rally, and thank you for giving us the opportunity to participate in this rally and speak to you.

We are gathering at a time when the people of the world are focusing on one of the most important issues in modern international life—the issue of complete and thorough disarmament.

All progressive mankind is struggling to achieve this humanitarian and most lofty goal, which is related to the lives of all people on our planet. We are delighted to see that the countries of the socialist camp are leading this struggle. They are the bulwark of all peace-loving forces in the world, and the example and hope for all freedom-loving, upright, and ordinary people.

Now, the world is divided into two actually existing camps. The imperialists have not only not stopped but, under the banner of the fragmented so-called "communist danger," are increasingly intensifying their aggressive offensives. In this situation, the Soviet Union, faithful to the Leninist foreign policy, has held high the idea of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social and political systems proposed by Lenin, firmly implemented this idea, and made every effort, not in words, but in deeds, to ease international tensions.

The call for complete and thorough disarmament has won the deep respect of all honest people and the people of all countries in the world, regardless of their race and nationality.

The summit meeting, to which the people of all countries once earnestly placed great hopes, was also intended to solve the noble and important task of maintaining peace.

However, when the struggle for easing international tensions and for a world without war and weapons becomes the banner of all people, all those who cherish peace and freedom cannot but see that the United States and some other countries influenced by the United States are continuing the arms race, even intensifying it, establishing new military bases, and arming with destructive weapons those revanchists who, not long ago, massacred millions upon millions of people.

The Soviet people, as well as the people of other countries, have never deceived themselves with illusions and have always kept in mind the conspiracies of the imperialists, and therefore have never relaxed their vigilance.

What is particularly disturbing to the Soviet people, the working people of the socialist camp, and all peace-loving people is the rapid revival of West German militarism, the further militarization of Japan, and the spread of new military bases around the world.

The increasingly intensified US war preparations recently cannot be viewed in isolation from the piratical spy flights that violated Soviet airspace.

The violations of the Soviet border by US aircraft for espionage and sabotage purposes are not only acts of aggression against our country, but also a blatant and serious provocation against world peace and the security of all peoples.

Due to the real situation and new facts, a new situation has emerged in international relations. On the eve of the summit conference, and even on the very days when the summit conference was supposed to be held, the Soviet Union was virtually deprived of the possibility of participating in the negotiations, because the Soviet Union could only participate in the negotiations on an equal footing, only when both sides had equal possibilities. The real situation, as well as the actions of the US leaders and President Eisenhower, prove that they are trying to undermine the improving international relations, exacerbate international tensions, and actually wreck the summit conference.

Anyone who seriously follows a policy of peace will understand that as long as the piratical imperialist plans are not put aside, as long as the US militarist aggressive bloc continues to influence the foreign policies of Western countries, and as long as all the bellows of the imperialist reactionaries are still fanning the flames of the "position of strength" and "cold war" policies, turning this policy, as facts have proven, into a "brink of war" policy, there can be no talk of easing international tensions at all.

Therefore, Comrade Khrushchev demanded a preparatory meeting on May 16, on the eve of the conference.

Comrade Khrushchev arrived in Paris two days before the meeting. As a tireless and staunch fighter for peace, a man trusted and loved by the entire party and the entire Soviet people, he resolutely demanded that Eisenhower publicly apologize before the start of the meeting, and that he publicly declare that such provocative incidents would no longer be repeated against the Soviet Union, a country that sincerely and frankly cooperates with the American people and its government in the cause of peace. As everyone knows, Eisenhower did not do so, nor did he express the necessary willingness to do so.

Today, all honest people are increasingly profoundly and clearly realizing that negotiations are not a tool for playing diplomatic tricks, but must be premised on the implementation of an open and honest policy by all countries. A consolidated and lasting peace cannot be built on cunning and treachery.

Khrushchev said that no, the Soviet government could not and would not deceive its people. How profound the truth contained in his words, how profound the respect and trust he expressed for the people, and what a sense of responsibility he showed for the fate of the people. Yes, let everyone know and remember: a policy based on deception and aimed against the vital interests of the people will not last long. No matter what, life will eventually move forward along its own path.

Khrushchev said: "The Soviet government is deeply convinced that if this US administration does not understand, then the next US administration will understand, and if the next US administration does not understand, then the next US administration will understand that there is no other way out than the peaceful coexistence of the capitalist system and the socialist system."

Attempts to distort the Soviet Union's position cannot confuse world public opinion. As for the summit conference, everyone understands that the road to such a conference is still open. It depends on the US government, and it depends on the governments of other Western countries. The US government has wrecked the conference, but the issues that should have been discussed have not lost their significance. Among these issues is the issue of concluding a peace treaty with Germany. Recent events have helped the people of all countries better understand: where is the road to lasting and reliable peace, who is hindering mankind from taking this road, where is the light, and where is the darkness.

Now, the imperialists have launched a blatant, shameless, and unscrupulous anti-communist propaganda campaign. They are conducting piratical flights over the territory of our country, where the Soviet people are engaged in peaceful labor, in an attempt to exert pressure and force our country to yield.

Millions of Soviet people are shouting in unison: "Gentlemen, it won't work!" We will teach those who are keen on adventure such a severe lesson that they will forbid their children and grandchildren from playing such jokes on the world's first Soviet socialist country.

Who today would dare to think of intimidating a country that has been able to manufacture and launch huge spaceships into the universe, guiding hundreds of millions of people to strive for the realization of communist construction plans and to climb the peaks of science and culture?

The imperialists cannot intimidate the Soviet people and the people of any other country in the socialist camp, because the socialist camp unites its strength, uniting the hearts of more than one billion people, because in the ranks of these people are the powerful and heroic 650 million Chinese people, because all honest people in the world sympathize with and support them.

We have seen with our own eyes that the colonial system is collapsing. The people of many countries have embarked on the road of resolutely fighting for their liberation, and their victory is as irresistible as life itself.

No matter how frantically the enemies of socialism rage, no matter what provocations and threats they make, the Soviet people are always full of optimism, always advancing confidently along the road of communist construction, and are unprecedentedly united around the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government, whose policies are thoroughly and unanimously supported by the workers, peasants, working intellectuals, and the entire people.

Let those who like to engage in various adventures also know that we have enough rockets to deal with those aircraft that attempt to violate our borders, not only enough to deal with those aircraft, but also enough to deal with those who send aircraft to violate the Soviet Union and other countries in the socialist camp, and to deal with those who provide their territory to others as bases for robbers.

The Soviet Union has every possibility to gloriously and worthily defend the great achievements of the October Revolution and make it inviolable, no matter where such violation comes from. Let the imperialist gentlemen also remember all this. Whoever wants to hinder the Soviet people from building communism, then the powerful Soviet army, which is full of combat honors and has experienced the heroic path of struggle and victory, will say to them: "Don't hinder us, get out of the way, so you can save yourselves. If you want to hinder us, then we won't be polite!" "Whoever stirs up the wind will reap the whirlwind."

Dear Comrades!

The Soviet state, as well as other countries in the socialist camp, will continue to resolutely advocate peaceful coexistence and will make every effort to build a lasting peace, despite the many obstacles on this road to lasting peace.

When imperialism is more openly baring its fangs and claws, the people of all countries should be more vigilant, unite their ranks more closely, vigilantly watch and ruthlessly expose the conspiracies of the imperialists and their lackeys—all kinds of revisionists—and be prepared to give the aggressors a resolute and destructive counterattack at any time.

In these days when the people of all countries in the world are shouting more loudly for internationalist solidarity, the Soviet people wholeheartedly congratulate the great fraternal Chinese people on achieving new achievements and new victories in the glorious road of building socialism under the leadership of their beloved, long-tested, and glorious Chinese Communist Party and its Chairman Mao Zedong.

Long live the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and China, the friendship between the people of all countries in the socialist camp, and the friendship between the people of all countries in the world!

Down with the warmongers, long live world peace!

Under the banner of the invincible doctrine of Marxism-Leninism, advance towards the victory of communism!

### 各国人民要更加紧密地团结自己的队伍  无情地揭露帝国主义者及其走狗的阴谋

    反对美帝国主义破坏四国首脑会议！
    在首都各界人民支持苏联正义立场、反对美帝国主义破坏四国首脑会议大会上的讲话
    各国人民要更加紧密地团结自己的队伍
    无情地揭露帝国主义者及其走狗的阴谋
    苏联驻中华人民共和国大使契尔沃年科的讲话亲爱的同志们、朋友们和兄弟们！
    正当苏联人民对美国战争挑拨者的阴谋表示愤怒抗议的时候，北京的居民和全体中国人民表示自己同苏联人民和整个社会主义阵营各国人民的兄弟般的团结一致，表示自己要粉碎美帝国主义者的罪恶阴谋这种坚定不移的意志和决心。我们这些国家的牢不可破的同盟是世界和平的有力保证，我们这些国家的人民过去、现在和将来始终站在一起、肩并肩地捍卫神圣的和平事业。
    我谨向领导今天这个盛大集会的各个团体表示感谢，感谢给我们机会参加这个集会并向大家讲话。
    我们是在这样的时候聚会的，这时候，全世界人民都注视着现代整个国际生活中的一个最重要的问题——全面彻底裁军问题。
    全体进步人类都在进行斗争，来实现这一个同我们星球上一切人的生活都有关系的、人道主义的、最崇高的目的。我们很高兴地看到，领导这个斗争的是社会主义阵营的国家，它们是全世界一切爱好和平力量的堡垒，是全世界爱好自由的、正直的、普通人的榜样和希望。
    现在，世界分裂成实际存在的两个阵营，帝国主义者不仅没有停止而且打着支离破碎的所谓“共产主义危险”的这面旗帜，日益加剧他们的侵略进攻，在这样的情况下，忠实于列宁主义的对外政策的苏联更高地举起了列宁提出的社会制度和政治制度不同的国家和平共处的思想，坚定不移地贯彻这一思想，尽一切力量，不是在口头上，而是在行动上致力于缓和国际紧张局势。
    全面彻底裁军的主张博得了全世界一切正直的人们、各国人民的深深的尊敬，不管他们属于什么种族和民族。
    各国人民曾经殷切寄予很大希望的最高级会议，也本来是要解决维护和平这一崇高和重大的任务的。
    但是，在争取缓和国际紧张局势、争取一个没有战争、没有武器的世界的斗争成为一切人的旗帜的时候，一切珍视和平和自由的人们都不能不看到，美国和受美国影响的其他一些国家继续军备竞赛，甚至加剧军备竞赛，建立新的军事基地，用毁灭性的武器武装那些在不久以前还曾经屠杀过千千万万人的复仇主义分子。
    苏联人民以及其他各国人民从来没有用幻想欺骗自己，一向记着帝国主义者的阴谋诡计，因此从来都没有放松警惕。
    苏联人民、社会主义阵营各国劳动人民和所有爱好和平的人民感到特别不安的是：西德军国主义迅速复活、日本进一步军国主义化，以及在世界各地遍布新的军事基地。
    在最近美国日益加紧备战的情况下，也不能孤立地看待侵犯苏联领空的强盗式的间谍飞行。
    美国飞机抱着间谍和破坏的目的而对苏联边界所进行的侵犯，不仅是对我国的侵略行为，而且也是对世界和平和各国人民安全的公然的严重挑衅。
    由于现实情况和新的事实，在国际关系中产生了新的情况。在高级会议召开的前夕，甚至在高级会议本应举行的日子里，苏联实际上被剥夺了参加谈判的可能性，因为只有在平等的基础上，只有在双方有同等可能性的情况下，苏联才能参加谈判。现实情况以及美国的领导者们和艾森豪威尔总统的行径都证明，他们尽力破坏趋向好转的国际关系，加剧国际紧张局势，实际上搞垮最高级会议。
    凡是认真遵循和平政策的人，他就会了解到，只要强盗式的帝国主义计划不抛在一边，只要美国军国主义侵略集团还继续影响西方国家的外交政策，只要帝国主义反动派的一切风箱还在煽起“实力地位”和“冷战”政策的火焰，使这种政策如事实所证明的那样转向“战争边缘”政策，那就根本谈不上什么缓和国际紧张局势了。
    因此，赫鲁晓夫同志才在5月16日，在会议前夕，要求开预备会议。
    赫鲁晓夫同志在会前两天到达巴黎，他作为争取和平的不倦的、坚定的战士，得到全党和全体苏联人民信任和爱戴的人，坚决要求艾森豪威尔在会议开始之前公开道歉，要求他公开声明对苏联这个建议同美国人民及其政府在争取和平的事业中真诚坦率合作的国家不再重复这类挑衅的事件。大家知道，艾森豪威尔没有这样做，也没有表示这样做的应有的意愿。
    今天，所有正直的人都越来越深刻地、清楚地了解到，谈判不是玩弄外交把戏的工具，而是要以各国实行开诚布公的真诚的政策为前提。巩固的持久的和平是不能建立在狡诈和背信弃义之上的。
    赫鲁晓夫说，不，苏联政府不可能，也不会欺骗自己的人民。他的话含有多么深刻的真理，他的话表现了对人民多么深刻的尊敬和信任，对人们的命运表现了何等的责任心。是的，让所有的人都知道和记住：基于欺骗的、旨在反对人民切身利益的政策是行不长的，不管怎么样，生活终将沿着自己的道路前进。
    赫鲁晓夫说：“苏联政府深信，如果这一届美国政府不理解，那么下一届美国政府将会理解，如果下一届美国政府不理解，那么再下一届美国政府将会理解，除了资本主义制度和社会主义制度这两个制度的和平共处以外，再无别的出路。”
    想歪曲苏联立场的企图，是混淆不了世界舆论的视听的。至于谈到最高级会议，每个人都明白，通向这种会议的道路仍然是敞开着的。这就要看美国政府了，要看其他西方国家政府了。美国政府破坏了会议，但是，原来应该讨论的问题并没有失去它的意义。这些问题中间，包括缔结对德和约问题。最近的事态有助于各国人民更好地了解：通向持久的可靠的和平的道路是在那里，是什么人在妨碍人类走这条路，哪里是光明，哪里是黑暗。
    现在，帝国主义者展开了肆无忌惮的、厚颜无耻的、丧尽天良的反共宣传，他们在苏联人民热火朝天地从事和平劳动的我国领土上空进行强盗式的飞行，想用这种办法施加压力，使我们国家低头让步。
    千百万苏联人同声高呼：“老爷们，行不通！”我们要狠狠地教训那些热中于冒险的家伙们，以至使他们会禁止他们的子子孙孙别同世界上第一个苏维埃社会主义国家开这种玩笑。
    苏联已经能够制造，并向宇宙发射庞大的飞船，引导千百万人为实现共产主义建设计划、为攀登科学和文化的高峰而奋斗，对这样的国家，今天谁还敢想加以恐吓呢？
    帝国主义者吓不倒苏联人民和社会主义阵营其他任何一国的人民，因为社会主义阵营把自己的力量团结在一起，把十亿以上人的心结成一体，因为在这些人民的行列中有强大的、英勇的六亿五千万中国人民，因为世界上一切正直的人都同情和支持他们。
    我们亲眼看到殖民主义体系正在土崩瓦解。许多国家的人民走上了为自己的解放而坚决斗争的道路，他们的胜利正像生活一样是不可抗拒的。
    不管社会主义的敌人怎样暴跳如雷，不管他们进行怎样的挑衅和威胁，苏联人民总是充满着乐观主义，总是满怀信心地沿着共产主义建设的道路前进，并且空前团结在苏联共产党和苏联政府的周围，党和政府的政策得到工人、农民、劳动知识分子、全体人民的彻底的一致支持。
    也让那些喜欢进行各种冒险的人们知道，我们有足够的火箭来对付那些试图侵犯边界的飞机，不仅足够对付那些飞机，而且足够对付那些派遣飞机来侵犯苏联以及社会主义阵营其他国家的人们，对付那些把自己的领土提供给别人作强盗基地的人们。
    苏联有一切可能来光荣无愧地捍卫十月革命的伟大成果，使它不受任何侵犯，不管这种侵犯来自何方。让帝国主义老爷们也记住这一切。谁要想阻挠苏联人民建设共产主义，那末满载战斗荣誉的、经历了斗争和胜利的英勇道路的强大苏军就会向他们说：“别妨碍我们，滚到一边去，这样可以保全你们自己。如果要妨碍我们，那可就不客气了！”“谁要煽起风来，谁就会自食风暴的后果。”
    亲爱的同志们！
    苏维埃国家以及社会主义阵营其他各国，今后仍将坚决主张和平共处，并且将尽一切努力来建立持久和平，尽管在这条通向持久和平的道路上还有不少障碍。
    当帝国主义更加公开地张牙舞爪的时候，各国人民都应该更加提高警惕，更加紧密地团结自己的队伍，警觉地注视和无情地揭露帝国主义者及其走狗——各色各样的修正主义者的阴谋，准备随时给予侵略者以坚决的毁灭性的反击。
    在全世界各国人民更加响亮地高呼国际主义团结的日子里，苏联人民衷心地祝贺伟大的兄弟的中国人民在自己的亲爱的久经斗争锻炼的光荣的中国共产党及其主席毛泽东同志的领导下，在建设社会主义的光辉道路上取得新的成就，取得新的胜利。
    苏中两国人民的永恒的牢不可破的友谊、社会主义阵营各国人民间的友谊、世界各国人民的友谊万岁！
    打倒战争挑拨者，世界和平万岁！
    在无往不胜的马克思列宁主义学说的旗帜下，向共产主义的胜利前进！
