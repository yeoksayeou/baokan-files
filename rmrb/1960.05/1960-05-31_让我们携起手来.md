Let Us Join Hands
Ito Takeo, Chairman of the Japan Press Association

During our visit to China, we personally participated in the grand rallies held by the Chinese people in Beijing and other places to support the Japanese people's struggle. This gave us great encouragement.

What made us even more grateful was that we had the honor of meeting Chairman Mao Zedong during our visit to Wuhan. The great leader of the Chinese people had a long and cordial conversation with us. What touched us most was that his words convinced us that the just struggle of the Japanese people, supported by the people of the world, will surely be victorious in the future. The Japanese people's struggle against the running dog of U.S. imperialism, the Kishi Nobusuke government, is closely linked to the struggle of the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries against imperialism and colonialism, and to the struggle of the people of the world to defend peace, and they support each other. As the Japanese people's anti-American and anti-Kishi struggle reached its climax, the people of South Korea formed a strong fighting force and drove the U.S. imperialist stooge Syngman Rhee out of power. Subsequently, the U.S.-backed Turkish Menderes regime also collapsed. Faced with this chain reaction, the United States was greatly dismayed and fell into a very embarrassing predicament because of the U-2 spy plane incident.

The Japanese people's struggle for democracy, independence, neutrality, and peace is not without difficulties on the road ahead, and may be a long-term one. However, today's era is very different from the past, and there is nothing to fear in front of us. Let us join hands with the 650 million Chinese people, join hands with the people of the world who are participating in the anti-imperialist united front, and advance in the common struggle!

    让我们携起手来
    日本新闻社会长　伊藤武雄
    在我们访问中国的期间，我们亲自参加北京及其他各地中国人民支援日本人民斗争的盛大集会。这给了我们很大的鼓舞。
    更加使我们感激的是，我们在访问武汉的期间荣幸地会见了毛泽东主席。中国人民的伟大领袖同我们进行了长时间的亲切的谈话。我们所最感动的是，他的话使我们确信得到全世界人民支援的日本人民的正义斗争将来必然会获得胜利。日本人民反对美帝国主义的走狗岸信介政府的斗争是和亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争以及全世界人民保卫和平的斗争紧密地联系在一起的，并且彼此互相支持。当日本人民反美反岸的斗争走向高潮时，南朝鲜人民组成了强大的斗争队伍，把美帝国主义走狗李承晚赶下台去。接着，美国扶植的土耳其曼德列斯政权也垮台了。面对这种连锁反应大为狼狈的美国，又因U—2型飞机事件而陷于十分狼狈的困境。
    日本人民争取民主、独立、中立与和平的斗争，在前进道路上不是没有困难的，而且可能是长期的。但是，今天的时代和过去大不相同，在我们的面前是没有什么可怕的。让我们同六亿五千万中国人民携起手来，同全世界参加反帝统一战线的人民携起手来，在共同斗争中前进吧！
