Xinhua News Agency, 6th: The Indonesian Workers Delegation, which came to participate in the "May Day" International Labor Day celebrations, issued a statement in Beijing today, expressing its full support for the joint statement issued on the 2nd by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, and the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea. The joint statement was regarding opposition to the Japan-U.S. military alliance, support for the patriotic and just struggle of the South Korean people, support for the struggle of the Miike coal miners in Japan, and the national independence struggles of the African people.

The statement said that the Indonesian people, in their struggle against domestic rebel groups, have suffered the brutal interference of U.S. imperialism and the pain it brings. The Indonesian Workers Delegation therefore fully supports the joint statement of the Chinese, Japanese, and Korean trade union organizations. This joint statement is very correct and just.

The statement said: The Indonesian Workers Delegation firmly believes that due to the unity and support of Asian and African workers, all interference and other conspiracies carried out by U.S. imperialism in Japan, South Korea, and other imperialists in Africa will surely be completely defeated.

The Indonesian Workers Delegation issuing this statement is composed of the delegation of the Central Cooperation Conference of Indonesian Government Employee Organizations, the delegation of the Cooperation Conference of Trade Unions in Foreign-Funded Enterprises, and the delegation of the All-Indonesia Central Trade Union Federation.
