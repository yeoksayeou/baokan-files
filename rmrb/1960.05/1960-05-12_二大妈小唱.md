Column: Spring City New Song

	In the past, the Auntie Er next door
	Only cared for her family's firewood, rice, oil, and salt;
	She spent all year spinning around the stove,
	Spinning until she was dizzy and her eyes blurred;
	Taking care of her husband's clothes, shoes, and socks,
	Raising a whole bunch of children;
	Caring for this one and neglecting that one,
	Busy with sewing and washing;
	So busy that her feet barely touched the ground,
	And a big knot formed in her heart.
	Now, the Auntie Er next door
	Participates in street production;
	Welcoming the good news team,
	Wearing a big red flower on her chest;
	Since leaving the stove,
	She always has a smile and is happy;
	The factory is like her own home,
	And a red flag is planted on the operating table;
	Skillful and clever in promoting "double modernization,"
	Her face is full of smiles like the morning sun.
	Auntie Er used to be weak,
	Now she can do the work of three people;
	Auntie Er used to be illiterate,
	Now she can write, calculate, and has methods;
	Auntie Er used to not know how to sing a single line!
	Now she composes, performs, and is also a cultural and recreational activist.
	Auntie Er, Auntie Er,
	The same Auntie Er,
	Why has she changed so much?
	The urban people's commune has been established!

    二大妈小唱
    李岳南从前隔壁的二大妈，柴米油盐只顾家；长年围着锅台转，转的头昏眼发花；照料丈夫衣、鞋、袜，拉扯孩子一扑拉；顾了这头丢了那，忙了缝补忙洗刷；忙的脚尖不落地，心上结了个大疙瘩。如今隔壁的二大妈，街道生产她参加；报喜队伍面前迎，胸前戴上大红花；自从离开锅台后，笑口常开乐哈哈；工厂就是自己家，操作台上红旗插；心灵手巧搞“双化”，满脸堆笑似朝霞。二大妈从前身力差，如今干活能顶仨；二大妈从前是文盲，如今学写会算有办法；二大妈从前一句也不会唱！如今自编自演还是文娱活动家。二大妈，二大妈，同是这个二大妈，为什么变化这么大？城市人民公社成立啦！
