Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an Dispatch: Shaanxi Province's summer harvest crops are showing a scene of bumper harvest. Wheat in the Hanzhong Basin has already begun to be harvested, and the Guanzhong Plain, the main wheat-producing area, will soon be harvested. Under the unified leadership of the Provincial Summer Harvest Headquarters, all industries and professions in the province, including industry, commerce, transportation, culture, education, and health, are launching a new upsurge of nationwide support for agriculture centered on supporting the summer harvest.

The summer harvest machinery repair teams, uniformly organized by factories throughout the province, have gone to the countryside one after another. They carry machinery, materials, and parts to ensure repairs are made as soon as breakdowns occur. Commercial departments have sent a large number of cadres to factories and production areas to organize the production of summer harvest machinery and tools and supply them to production teams in a timely manner. The commercial bureaus of Chang'an, Lantian, and Hu counties alone have dispatched more than 500 cadres to the Qinling mountainous area to organize local people's communes to produce more than 2.64 million summer harvest tools. At present, the province has overfulfilled its production plans for sickles, bamboo and wooden forks, whetstones, and brooms.

The grain department is making a concentrated effort to prepare for the storage and preservation of new grain. At the same time, it is vigorously carrying out technical innovations and manufacturing new machinery for loading, unloading, turning, drying, and inspecting grain to improve warehouse efficiency. The stores, canteens, and hotels of each grain station are also stepping up rectification to facilitate the masses delivering grain and save delivery time.

The transportation department regards the transportation of summer harvest materials as the overriding central task at present. By May 15, the total volume of summer harvest materials transported throughout the province had reached more than 90,000 tons. The province's transportation departments began a transport blitz month from late April, striving to complete the transport of summer harvest materials before the end of May and to complete part of the June transport task in advance, freeing up strength to support the summer harvest.

Local health departments are also organizing mobile medical teams and groups to go deep into the fields; at the same time, they are stepping up the training of food administrators, cooks, nursery workers, midwives, and health workers to improve the work of canteens and nurseries.

All government agencies, schools, and military units will allocate labor to participate in the summer harvest. The relevant provincial departments have also formed two mechanized harvesting brigades, which will advance northwest along the Xi'an-Lanzhou Highway and the Weinan-Tongchuan Highway, respectively. This year, the people's communes in various cities will also organize commune members to go to the countryside to support the summer harvest.

This summer harvest support movement in Shaanxi Province is another upsurge of nationwide support for agriculture following the fight against drought. (Attached picture)

    各行各业深入田间　全民动员参加夏收
    陕西掀起支援农业新高潮
    据新华社西安电　陕西省夏收作物呈现一片丰收景象。汉中盆地小麦已经开镰收割，主要产麦区关中平原不久就要收割。在省夏收指挥部统一领导下，全省工、商、交通、文教、卫生等各行各业正在掀起一个以支援夏收为中心的全民支援农业新高潮。
    全省工厂统一组成的夏收机具检修队已纷纷下乡，他们都携带机具、材料、零件，保证随坏随修。商业部门派出大批干部驻在工厂和产地，组织夏收机械和工具的生产，并且及时地供应到生产队。仅长安、蓝田、鄠县等县的商业局就抽出五百多干部到秦岭山区，组织当地人民公社生产了二百六十四万多件夏收工具。目前全省镰刀、竹木杈、磨刀石、扫帚等都已超额完成生产计划。
    粮食部门突击进行新粮储存保管的准备工作，同时大搞技术革新，制造了装卸、翻晒、检验粮食的新机具，提高入库效率。各粮站的商店、食堂、旅店也加紧整顿，以便利送粮群众，节约送粮时间。
    交通运输部门把夏收物资的运输作为当前压倒一切的中心任务。到5月15日，全省夏收物资的总运量已达九万多吨。全省交通部门从4月下旬起就开始了运输突击月，力争5月底以前突击完成夏收物资的运输任务，并提前完成6月份的部分运输任务，腾出力量支援夏收。
    各地卫生部门也正在组织巡回医疗队、组，深入田间；同时加紧培训伙食管理员、炊事员、保育员、接生员和保健员，以改善食堂、托儿所的工作。
    各机关、学校和部队都将抽出劳力参加夏收。省有关部门还组成两个机械化收割大队，将分别沿着西兰公路和渭南、铜川公路向西北推进。各城市人民公社今年也将组织社员下乡支援夏收。
    陕西省这次支援夏收运动，是继抗旱以后的又一次全民支援农业的高潮。（附图片）
