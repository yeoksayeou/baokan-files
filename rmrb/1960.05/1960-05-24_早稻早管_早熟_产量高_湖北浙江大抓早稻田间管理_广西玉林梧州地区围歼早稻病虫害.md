Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 22nd: Hubei Province's people overcame continuous rain and cold waves, winning a decisive victory in early rice from sowing to transplanting. Now, people's communes everywhere are comprehensively strengthening early rice topdressing, weeding, seedling checking, seedling replacement, and field management work.

　　In March of this year, during the sowing and seedling cultivation of early rice in Hubei Province, continuous overcast and rainy weather was encountered, as well as three longer cold waves. Entering April, the temperature in the province was still low, affecting the normal growth of seedlings. Some areas were also hit by storms and hail. However, the Hubei people, full of enthusiasm, under the leadership of Party organizations at all levels, fully utilized the great power of the people's communes and waged a tenacious struggle with nature to ensure the sowing area, quality, and timely sowing of early rice. The broad masses of commune members stayed in the fields day and night, doing everything possible to prevent rotten seedlings and promote rapid seedling growth. The commune members of Huanggang Prefecture, under the leadership of cadres, organized more than 78,000 people to participate in seedling protection teams, using methods such as erecting windbreaks, smoking, applying insulation fertilizer, and adding coverings to increase air temperature, water temperature, and ground temperature, creating suitable growth conditions for seedlings. Wu Chungen, secretary of the Shishou County Party Committee, went deep into the fields and, together with veteran farmers, researched methods such as changing water to wash seedlings, spraying pesticides to prevent diseases and pests, and increasing topdressing to revive withered seedlings.

　　During the transplanting period, various places also launched communist large-scale collaboration, promoted transplanting machines, and accelerated transplanting progress.

　　In response to the characteristics of this year's low temperature, less sunshine, long seedling stage, and tender seedlings, various places immediately grasped the field management work after transplanting. Huanggang Prefecture has now entered a high tide of early rice field management centered on topdressing, including measures such as weeding, pest control, seedling checking, seedling replacement, frequent irrigation, and shallow irrigation. About one million mu of the 2.8 million mu of early rice in the district has been topdressed for the first time and weeded for the first time. Fifteen thousand laborers in Xishui County are transplanting and managing at the same time, focusing on fertilizer, striving for complete seedlings, strong seedlings, and more seedlings. According to the characteristics of early rice this year, Shishou County has fixed leaders, labor, and measures early, and determined the method of "six earlies and one diligence": early seedling checking and replacing, early application of quick-acting fertilizer, early middle plowing and weeding, early prevention and control of diseases and insect pests, early preparation for covering, frequent drainage, and shallow irrigation, striving for early maturity and high yield of early rice. Many areas have researched some effective methods to eliminate and shorten the greening period of early rice, so as to promote early tillering and more tillering of early rice.

　　This newspaper reports: After successfully completing the first batch of early rice transplanting tasks, all parts of Zhejiang Province have comprehensively launched a mass movement of high-standard early rice field management centered on cultivating fields, topdressing, ensuring all seedlings, and strengthening seedlings, breaking through the early rice rooting, greening, and growth stages, and striving for no weeds, no fertilizer deficiency, no missing plants, no water shortage, and no diseases and insects in the fields, so that this year's early rice field management can achieve early, fast, and good results. As of the 18th, the province had cultivated and topdressed 10,870,000 mu of early rice fields once, and 4,000,000 mu had been cultivated and topdressed twice. At present, the 15 million mu of early rice that has been transplanted in the province has taken root, turned green, and most of it has grown well.

　　This year, all parts of Zhejiang are managing rice fields with high standards, striving for a comprehensive bumper harvest. Leaders above the brigade level in Huangyan County have established more than 2,000 mu of early rice command fields, cadres at all levels have planted 15,000 mu of experimental fields, and commune members have created 105,000 mu of high-yield demonstration plots. Now, all of the more than 300,000 mu of early rice in the county has completed the first cultivation, more than half has been cultivated twice, and most of the early rice has been topdressed once. Ruian County has comprehensively carried out pest control work, spraying more than 37,000 mu with pesticides, ensuring the healthy growth of early rice seedlings.

　　In the careful management of early rice, the broad masses of cadres and people are doing everything possible to improve tools, so that field management can be both good and fast. According to the characteristics of the local clay soil, cadres and commune members in the Wenzhou area have created and promoted the middle-tillage hoe, which can turn the soil between the rice rows, which can promote the early release of base fertilizer, remove weeds, loosen the soil, and improve work efficiency by five or six times compared with manual weeding. Shaoxing County has promoted more than 10,000 sets of three advanced tools, such as the "eight-legged" weeding machine.

　　This newspaper reports: Yulin and Wuzhou prefectures in Guangxi have mobilized 300,000 people to encircle and suppress early rice diseases and insect pests.

　　This year, after the transplanting of early rice in Yulin and Wuzhou prefectures, due to drought and other reasons, early rice suffered from rice blast, leaf rollers, rice stem borers, and other diseases and insect pests. As soon as the diseases and insect pests emerged, various places immediately organized forces and took measures to encircle and suppress them. Now, 95.9% of the early rice affected by diseases and insect pests in Yulin Prefecture has been treated. The proportion of early rice treated in Wuzhou Prefecture has also reached 87%.

    早稻早管　早熟　产量高
    湖北浙江大抓早稻田间管理
    广西玉林梧州地区围歼早稻病虫害
    目前，五岭以南地区的早稻正在孕穗，五岭以北长江以南地区的早稻大部处在分蘖盛期，长江沿岸的湖北、江苏、安徽等省的早稻也进入分蘖阶段。当前早稻田间管理的中心是：五岭以南攻穗、攻粒；五岭以北保蘖、壮蘖，为攻穗、攻粒创造条件。
    新华社武汉22日电　湖北省人民战胜连续几次的久雨、寒潮，赢得了早稻从播种到插秧的决定性的胜利。现在，各地人民公社正在全面加强早稻追肥、薅草、查苗补苗和田间管理工作。
    今年3月，正当湖北省早稻播种、育秧期间，遭到连续的阴雨，还遇到三次时间较长的寒潮；进入4月，全省气温仍低，影响秧苗的正常生长，部分地区还受到风暴和冰雹的袭击。但是，干劲冲天的湖北人民在各级党组织的领导下，充分发挥了人民公社的巨大威力，为保证早稻播种面积、质量和及时下种，和自然作了顽强的斗争。广大社员们日不离田、夜伴秧眠，千方百计地防止烂秧和促使秧苗快速生长。黄冈专区的公社社员们在干部领导下，组织了七万八千多人参加护秧队伍，用搭防风幛、熏烟、增施保温肥、加复盖物等办法，提高气温、水温和地温，创造秧苗适宜的生长条件。石首县县委书记吴春根深入田间，和老农一起研究出换水洗苗、喷药防治病虫害和增加追肥等办法，使枯苗转青成活。
    在插秧期间各地又开展共产主义大协作，推广插秧机，加速插秧进度。
    针对今年气温低，日照少，早秧秧期长、秧亩嫩的特点，各地在插秧后，立即抓紧了田间管理工作。黄冈专区目前已进入以追肥为中心，包括薅草、除虫、查苗、补苗、勤灌浅灌等措施的早稻田间管理高潮，全区二百八十万亩早稻有一百万亩左右已追过头次肥薅过头次草。浠水县十五万劳动大军边插边管，以肥为中心，力争苗全、苗壮、苗多。石首县根据今年早稻的特点，提早固定领导、劳力和措施，确定早查苗补兜，早追施速效肥料，早中耕除草，早防治病虫害，早作好复盖准备，勤排浅灌的“六早一勤”的办法，力争早稻早熟高产。许多地区都研究出一些有效办法，力争消灭和缩短早稻返青期，以促使早稻早分蘖、多分蘖。
    本报讯　浙江省各地在胜利完成第一批早稻插种任务后，全面掀起以耘田、追肥、全苗、壮苗为中心的早稻田间管理高标准的群众运动，大破早稻扎根、转青、发棵关，力争田间无杂草、无脱肥、无缺株、无缺水、无病虫，使今年早稻田间管理达到早、快、好。到18日止，全省已有一千零八十七万亩早稻田进行一次耘田和追肥，有四百万亩进行过两次耘田、追肥。目前全省已插的一千五百万亩早稻已经扎根、转青，大部分已经发棵，生长良好。
    今年，浙江各地都以高标准管理稻田，力争全面大丰收。黄岩县全县大队以上领导干部建立了二千多亩早稻指挥田，各级干部种了一万五千亩试验田，社员搞了十万五千亩丰产方。现在全县三十多万亩早稻全部结束了第一次耘田，半数以上耘过二次，大部分早稻追施过一次肥料。瑞安县全面开展除虫工作，已喷药三万七千多亩，保证了早稻苗健壮生长。
    在精心管理早稻中，广大干部和群众千方百计改进工具，使田间管理做到既好又快。温州地区的干部和社员根据本地区的粘土壤特点，创造和推广了中耕锄，用它可把稻行间泥土翻过来，可以促使基肥早发、又可除草、松土，工效比手工耘田提高五、六倍。绍兴县推广了“八脚”耘田器等三种先进工具一万多部。
    本报讯　广西玉林和梧州两专区，出动三十万人围歼早稻病虫害。
    今年玉林和梧州两专区，早稻插下后，因天旱等原因，早稻发生稻热病、卷叶虫、钻心虫等病虫害。各地在病虫害刚一露头，便立即组织力量，采取措施围歼。现在，玉林专区受病虫害的早稻已有95.9％得到防治。梧州专区得到防治的也达到87％。
