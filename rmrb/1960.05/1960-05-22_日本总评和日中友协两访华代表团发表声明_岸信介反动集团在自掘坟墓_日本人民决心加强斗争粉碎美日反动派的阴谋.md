Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 21st. After receiving news on the 20th that the Kishi Nobusuke clique had forcibly passed the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" in the Japanese Diet, the visiting delegation of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, which is currently visiting Shanghai, issued a statement saying: "We believe that the despicable actions taken by the Kishi Nobusuke reactionary clique this time will only accelerate the demise of the U.S.-Japan reactionary group and will achieve nothing else. We must summon a hundredfold courage and launch a powerful struggle against this aggressive and traitorous U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty."

The visiting delegation of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan issued the following statement on the 20th:

"The Kishi Nobusuke reactionary clique, with U.S. imperialism as its strong backing, has finally left an indelible stain on Japanese history.

"Today, the Kishi Nobusuke reactionary clique trampled on the Japanese Constitution and democracy in the Diet, disregarded the Diet Law, used police violence to drive out of the Diet members of the opposition parties who were legally elected by the people, and the Liberal Democratic Party alone forcibly 'passed' the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty,' which was clearly opposed by the majority of the people.

"This is a provocative act against the Japanese people who oppose war and desire peace, and against the peace-loving people of the world. At the same time, it thoroughly exposes the nature of the U.S.-Japan reactionary group, which has been driven into a dead end by the increasingly high-spirited struggle of the Japanese people.

"Currently, the situation in Japan is exactly the same as the countless acts of tyranny implemented by the Syngman Rhee regime in South Korea in the past. Facts have proven that imperialist groups are bound to follow the same path, and their future fate is bound to be the same as that of Syngman Rhee.

"It is very clear that this atrocity can only serve to further expand and strengthen the Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty,' arouse the anger of strata that were previously unconcerned about this issue, and dig a grave for the Kishi Nobusuke reactionary clique.

"The Kishi Nobusuke reactionary clique originally intended to use this atrocity as the only gift for U.S. President Eisenhower's visit to Japan in mid-June, but in reality, it is having the completely opposite effect. When Eisenhower visits Japan, the anger of the Japanese people will surely reach its peak.

"We believe that the despicable actions taken by the Kishi Nobusuke reactionary clique this time will only accelerate the demise of the U.S.-Japan reactionary group and will achieve nothing else. We must summon a hundredfold courage and launch a powerful struggle against this aggressive and traitorous U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.

"We will be returning home in a week. Before returning home, our visiting delegation of the General Council of Trade Unions hopes that Chinese friends will always give us strong support, and firmly declares that after returning home, we will definitely fight with full confidence of victory."

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, May 21st. Before leaving Guangzhou to return home, the visiting delegation of the Japan-China Friendship Association issued a statement to the Guangzhou press, opposing the Kishi Nobusuke government's forcible passage of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and U.S. imperialism's sabotage of the great power summit conference. The delegation's statement is as follows:

"On May 19th, the Kishi Nobusuke government mobilized a large number of police, used violence to expel opposition party members from the Diet building, and adopted despicable, barbaric, and fascist means to forcibly pass the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty in the House of Representatives. This was done despite the fact that tens of millions of Japanese people had conducted sixteen unified struggles and repeatedly protested, and despite the protests and condemnations and support of the 650 million Chinese people, Asian people, and peace-loving people around the world who support the Japanese people's struggle. This also shows that they are carrying out the orders of their master, U.S. imperialism, which attempts to dominate the world through aggressive war. On the eve of convening the East-West summit conference, U.S. imperialism dispatched military reconnaissance planes to openly intrude into Soviet territory. This is them breaking their own promises and destroying the four-power summit conference. U.S. imperialism has torn off its mask of false peace, and its crimes of sabotaging peace are clearly exposed before the people of the world. This path of aggression and war will never succeed. There is no need to list long historical examples; the current struggle of the South Korean people has already proven this point. The U.S. imperialist lackey, Syngman Rhee, was driven off the stage by the great power of the South Korean people. The measures taken by Kishi Nobusuke to forcibly approve the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty are digging his own grave in front of the people of Japan, Asia, and the world.

"The Japanese people's struggle has now entered a new stage. The members of our Japan-China Friendship Association visiting delegation will bring back to Japan the valuable experience of fighting together with the 650 million Chinese people, and after returning home, we will join the ranks of the new struggle. In order to crush the conspiracy to continue deliberating on the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty in the House of Councillors, and in order to drive U.S. imperialism out of every corner of Japan and Asia, we will further strengthen the struggle.

"We sincerely thank Chairman Mao and the 650 million Chinese people for the support and encouragement they gave us during our visit to China, as if we were their own relatives. At the same time, we will convey the valuable experience of fighting together with the Chinese people to our comrades-in-arms in Japan, and enhance their confidence in the struggle."

The delegation of the Japan-China Friendship Association, headed by Masuzo Akatsu, arrived in Guangzhou by train from Hangzhou today. Japanese journalist Takeo Ito and others also came here at the same time.

    日本总评和日中友协两访华代表团发表声明
    岸信介反动集团在自掘坟墓
    日本人民决心加强斗争粉碎美日反动派的阴谋
    新华社上海21日电　正在上海访问的日本工会总评议会访华代表团20日得到岸信介集团在日本国会强行通过日美“安全条约”的消息后发表声明说：“我们认为岸信介反动集团这次所采取的卑鄙行为，除加速日美反动集团的死亡之外，是一无所得的。我们一定要拿出百倍的勇气，对这一侵略性的、卖国的日美军事同盟条约开展强有力的反抗斗争。”
    日本工会总评议会访华代表团20日发表声明如下：
    “以美帝国主义为强大后盾的岸信介反动集团，终于在日本历史上留下了一个不可洗刷的大污点。
    岸信介反动集团，今天在国会上蹂躏了日本宪法和民主，忽视了国会法，用警察暴力把人民合法选出的在野政党议员赶出国会，由自由民主党单独强行‘通过’了已明显遭到大多数人民反对的日美‘安全条约’。
    “这是对反对战争、渴望和平的日本人民和全世界爱好和平人民的挑衅行为，同时也彻底暴露了被日本人民日益高涨的斗争驱入穷途的日美反动集团的本质。
    “目前，日本的现状，与过去李承晚政权在南朝鲜所实行的无数暴政完全相同。事实证明，帝国主义集团必然要走同样的道路，而其今后的命运，也必然会遭到同李承晚一样的下场。
      “很明显，这次的暴行只能起这样的作用：进一步扩大和加强日本人民反对日美‘安全条约’的斗争，激起以往不关心这一问题的阶层的愤怒；为岸信介反动集团挖掘坟墓。
    “岸信介反动集团，本来打算把这一次的暴行作为对美国总统艾森豪威尔于6月中旬访日时的唯一礼物，但实际上却起着完全相反的作用，当艾森豪威尔访问日本的时候，日本人民的愤怒，必将达到高峰。
    “我们认为岸信介反动集团这次所采取的卑鄙行为，除加速日美反动集团的死亡之外，是一无所得的。我们一定要拿出百倍的勇气，对这一侵略性的、卖国的日美军事同盟条约开展强有力的反抗斗争。
    “一星期之后，我们就要回国了。在回国之前，我们总评访华代表团，希望中国朋友永远给予强有力的支援，并坚决表示，回国后一定满怀胜利的信心进行奋斗。”
    新华社广州21日电　日本中国友好协会访华代表团在离广州回国前夕，向广州新闻界发表声明，反对岸信介政府强行通过日美军事同盟条约和美帝国主义破坏大国首脑会议。代表团的声明如下：
    “岸信介政府在5月19日动员大批警察，在国会议事堂用暴力驱逐在野党议员，采取卑鄙野蛮的法西斯手段，在众议院强行通过了日美军事同盟条约，这是在上千万日本人民进行十六次统一斗争，一再提出抗议的情况下，同时在支持日本人民斗争的六亿五千万中国人民、亚洲人民和全世界爱好和平人民抗议谴责和支持之下，所采取十分狼狈的一种窘态的情况下通过的。这又说明它们执行企图以侵略战争称霸于世界的主子美帝国主义的命令。美帝国主义在召开东西方首脑会议的前夕，派遣军事侦察飞机公然侵入苏联领土，这是它们自己破坏了自己的诺言和破坏四国首脑会议。美帝国主义已经撕下了假和平的面具，它的破坏和平的罪恶在世界人民的面前清清楚楚的暴露出来了。这种侵略与战争的道路，是绝不能得逞的。不必列举很久的历史事例，目前南朝鲜人民的斗争事例已证明了这一点，美帝国主义走狗李承晚在南朝鲜人民伟大的力量面前被赶下台了。岸信介为了强行批准日美军事同盟条约所采取的措施，是在日本、亚洲、全世界人民面前挖掘着自己的坟墓。
    “日本人民的斗争现在已经进入了新的阶段。我们日中友好协会访华代表团的团员，将把同中国六亿五千万人民共同斗争的宝贵经验带回日本，回国以后参加新的斗争行列。为了粉碎在参议院继续审议日美军事同盟条约的阴谋，为了从日本和亚洲各个角落赶走美帝国主义而进一步加强斗争。
    “我们衷心地感谢在中国访问期间，毛主席和六亿五千万中国人民给予我们的如同亲人般的支持和鼓舞。同时我们把同中国人民共同斗争的宝贵经验传达给在日本的战友们，增强他们斗争的信心。”
    以赤津益造为首的日中友好协会代表团，是在今天从杭州乘火车到达广州的。日本新闻工作者伊藤武雄等也同时来到这里。
