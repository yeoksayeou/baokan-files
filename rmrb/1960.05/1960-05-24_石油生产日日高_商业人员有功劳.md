Oil Production Rises Daily
Commercial Personnel Deserve Credit

On the vast Gobi Desert of Karamay, beside the busy derricks, when the oil workers pick up their steaming bowls of rice and eat their fragrant dishes, or when they comfortably get a haircut, they naturally feel grateful for the hard work of the commercial personnel and think of the Party's kind concern.

Karamay, this is a place of great concern to the people of the whole country. People are not only concerned about the abundant oil reserves there, but also about the lives of the oil workers. Now, the commercial workers there are using their hard work to properly arrange the lives of the oil-winning warriors. While celebrating the victory of oil production, people also admire the great contributions of the commercial workers. Just as the workers said: "Oil production rises daily, commercial personnel deserve credit."

The Karamay oil area is vast, the mines are scattered, transportation is inconvenient, and the climate is constantly changing. These are all difficulties placed before the commercial workers. However, for those who are full of enthusiasm for building socialism, no matter how many difficulties there are, they are fearless. Look: the cooks are trying their best to set up stoves on the Gobi Desert in the cold wind; the barbers travel dozens of miles back and forth to give haircuts to the workers... It is precisely this enthusiasm for serving the cause of socialist construction that makes the difficulties bow down before them.

The warm service of the Tongjialiang Store and the Guangfu Road Store once moved many people. Now, the outstanding achievements of the commercial workers in Karamay are moving people again. Such touching things are emerging endlessly in our country!

### 石油生产日日高  商业人员有功劳

    石油生产日日高
    商业人员有功劳
    在克拉玛依辽阔的戈壁滩上，在繁忙的井架旁边，当采油工端起热气腾腾的饭碗，就着香喷喷的菜肴吃饭，或是舒舒坦坦理上一次发的时候，自然要感激商业人员的辛勤劳动，自然想到党的亲切关怀。
    克拉玛依，这是个全国人民十分关心的地方。人们不仅关心着那里藏量丰富的石油，而且也关心着石油工人的生活。现在那里的商业工作者用自己辛勤的劳动，为夺油战士妥善地安排了生活。人们在欢庆夺油胜利的同时，也赞赏商业工作者的巨大贡献。正如工人同志们所说：“石油生产日日高，商业人员有功劳。”
    克拉玛依油区幅员辽阔，矿井分散，交通不便，而且气候冷暖变幻无常。这些都是摆在商业工作者面前的困难。但是，对于那些充满着建设社会主义热情的人来说，即使困难再多，也是无所畏惧的。瞧：炊事员想尽办法，冒着冷风在戈壁滩上架起了炉灶；理发员来回几十里路为工人理发……。正是这种积极为社会主义建设事业服务的热情，困难就在他们面前低头了。
    同家梁商店、光复道商店的服务热情，曾经使许多人感动过，现在克拉玛依商业工作者的出色成绩，又在感动着人们。这种感人的事情，在我们国家里是层出不穷的！
