Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 7th: According to the Korean Central News Agency, Kaesong: At today's meeting of secretaries of both sides of the Korean Military Armistice Commission, the Secretary General of the Korean-Chinese side, Senior Colonel Lin Qizhi, lodged a serious protest to the US side regarding the provocative act of a US vessel violating the armistice agreement by firing on a small vessel of the Korean-Chinese side that was performing normal patrol duties.

Senior Colonel Lin Qizhi pointed out that on May 4th, a US naval vessel took advantage of the foggy weather to approach the coastal waters of the northern east coast of Korea. After the Korean-Chinese side's vessel discovered it, it sent several warning signals for it to return, but the US vessel suddenly fired on the Korean-Chinese side's vessel. After being fired upon, the Korean-Chinese side's vessel had no choice but to take self-defense measures. The US naval vessel fired fiercely at the Korean-Chinese side's vessel with 76mm, 40mm, and 20mm machine guns for twenty minutes before fleeing.

Senior Colonel Lin Qizhi pointed out that this provocative act by the US naval vessel is a blatant violation of the armistice agreement and a naked expression of the US attempt to intensify the tense situation in Korea.

The Secretary General of the Korean-Chinese side demanded that the US side, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the armistice agreement, strictly punish all US personnel who dispatched naval vessels to carry out provocative and hostile acts against the Korean-Chinese side, and take thorough measures to prevent the recurrence of such incidents. However, in order to evade guilt, the US side attempted to shift the responsibility for this incident onto the Korean-Chinese side. The Secretary General of the Korean-Chinese side pointed out that no conspiracy or sophistry on the part of the US side can escape its responsibility for seriously violating the armistice agreement.

At today's meeting, the Secretary General of the Korean-Chinese side also protested to the US side regarding the violation of the armistice agreement by two US military aircraft crossing the military demarcation line and intruding into the airspace of the Korean-Chinese side on May 2nd.

    美军舰艇侵入朝鲜北部沿海射击朝中方面的舰艇
    朝中代表抗议美方的挑衅行为
    新华社平壤7日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社开城消息：朝鲜军事停战委员会朝中方面秘书长林箕济上校在今天举行的双方秘书长会议上，就美方的一艘舰艇违反停战协定向朝中方面的一艘执行正常巡逻任务的小型舰艇进行挑衅性射击的行为，向美方提出了严重的抗议。
    林箕济上校指出，5月4日，美方的一艘海军舰艇利用有雾的天气，接近了朝鲜北部东海岸沿海。朝中方面舰艇发现后，数次发出警号要它回去，但是美方舰艇却突然向朝中方面舰艇进行射击。朝中方面舰艇遭到射击后不得不采取了自卫措施。美方海军舰艇用七十六毫米、四十毫米、二十毫米等几种机关炮向朝中方面舰艇猛烈射击了二十分钟以后逃走了。
    林箕济上校指出，美方海军舰艇的这一挑衅行为是粗暴地违反停战协定的行为，也是美方企图加剧朝鲜紧张局势的露骨的表现。
    朝中方面秘书长要求美方根据停战协定有关条款，严格惩罚派遣海军舰艇向朝中方面进行挑衅性敌对行为的美方的一切人员，并采取彻底措施防止再发生此类事件。但是，美方为了逃避罪责，却企图把这次事件的责任转嫁于朝中方面。朝中方面秘书长指出，美方的任何阴谋和诡辩也不能逃避它严重违反停战协定的责任。
    朝中方面秘书长在今天的会议上，还就5月2日美方军用飞机两架越过军事分界线、侵入朝中方面地区上空的违反停战协定的行为向美方提出抗议。
