    Congratulations to the Red Engineers
    A group of excellent workers from Shanghai, Fujian, Qinghai, and Wuhan have been appointed as engineers, which is an exciting and encouraging piece of news.
    A large number of excellent workers becoming technical cadres and shouldering technical leadership responsibilities not only demonstrates the continuous improvement of the technical level of the Chinese working class, but also a comprehensive and great leap forward on the road to knowledge acquisition for workers and peasants. They are wholeheartedly loyal to socialism. They go wherever there are difficulties, and they will definitely do whatever is beneficial to socialist construction. This is the case in production, and it is also the case in learning culture. Under the Party's educational policy of walking on two legs, they have rapidly improved their scientific and cultural level through arduous spare-time study.
    Bourgeois educators ridicule our educational policy of walking on two legs, saying that this kind of education cannot cultivate real talents. The fact is exactly the opposite of what they said. We not only cultivate talents from workers through spare-time education, but also do so very quickly. This is something they never dreamed of. These red engineers are not only developing in some aspects, but are developing in an all-round way; they are not only excellent engineers today, but will be even more outstanding in the future. Does this not exactly show that the lowly are the most intelligent and the greatest? They know how to elevate practical experience to the level of scientific and technological theory, not to pursue personal fame and status, but to develop production and build socialism. This is the true color of the red engineers. Let us congratulate them on achieving even greater victories on the road to worker-peasant intellectualization.

    向红色工程师祝贺
    上海、福建、青海、武汉一批优秀工人荣任工程师，是一条令人兴奋鼓舞的消息。
    大批优秀工人成为技术干部，担负技术领导责任，这不仅说明我国工人阶级技术水平不断提高，而是全面大发展，在工农群众知识化的道路上飞跃前进。他们对社会主义忠心耿耿，哪里有困难，就到哪里去，只要对社会主义建设有利，一定做到。在生产上是这样，在学习文化上也是这样。在党的两条腿走路的教育方针下，他们通过艰苦的业余学习，迅速地提高了科学文化水平。
    资产阶级的教育家讥讽我们两条腿走路的教育方针，说这种教育不能培养出真正的人才，事实恰巧与他们所说的相反。我们不仅经过业余教育从工人中培养人才，而且速度很快。这真是他们做梦也想不到的事，这些红色工程师不是在一方面有些发展，而是全面大发展；不仅今天是出色的工程师，将来还要更出色。这不是正好说明卑贱者最聪明、最伟大吗？他们懂得把实际经验提高到科学技术理论水平，不是为了追求个人的名誉地位，而是为了发展生产，建设社会主义。这是红色工程师的本色。让我们祝贺他们在工农知识化的道路上取得更大的胜利。
