Iron-Wood Structure Dredgers

    Employees of the Kunming Municipal Transportation Bureau's Shipping Company and Automobile Repair Factory have successfully trial-produced iron-wood structure "paddle wheel" and "chain bucket" dredgers. Tests have shown that the two types of dredgers can dredge 37 cubic meters and 80 cubic meters of mud per hour, respectively, increasing efficiency by 290 times and more than 600 times compared to manual dredging.

    These two types of dredgers were trial-produced for dredging the Dianchi Lake waterway. Dianchi Lake shipping is an important component of Kunming's transportation.

    The employees of the City Shipping Company's repair workshop and the Automobile Repair Factory, who undertook the production of the dredgers, worked hard and diligently under rudimentary conditions, using a combination of indigenous and foreign methods to successfully trial-produce these two types of iron-wood structure dredgers that save steel in a short period of time. The "paddle wheel" dredger was manufactured in just over a month; the "chain bucket" dredger was also completed after forty days of hard work. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    铁木结构挖泥船
    昆明市交通运输局航运公司和汽车修理厂职工试制成功铁木结构的“轮鼓式”和“链兜式”挖泥船。经试验，两种挖泥船每小时能挖泥三十七立方米和八十立方米，比人工挖泥效率提高二百九十倍和六百倍以上。
    这两种挖泥船是为疏挖滇池航道试制的。滇池航运是昆明市交通运输的重要组成部分。
    承制挖泥船的市航运公司修理车间、汽车修理厂的职工，在设备简陋的条件下，苦钻苦干，用土洋结合的方法，在短期内试制成功了节省钢材的这两种铁木结构挖泥船。“轮鼓式”挖泥船，在一个多月的时间内即制造出来；“链兜式”挖泥船，经过四十天的苦干，也完成了制造任务。　（据新华社讯）
