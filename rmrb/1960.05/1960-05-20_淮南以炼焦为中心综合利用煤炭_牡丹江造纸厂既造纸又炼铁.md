Xinhua News Agency, Hefei Dispatch: Huainan City, Anhui Province, has adopted the method of indigenous methods and a combination of indigenous and foreign methods to launch a coal comprehensive utilization movement centered on coking, vigorously developing oil, gas, chemicals, and water. As of April 30, the city has built 45 coal comprehensive utilization factories, with 36 kinds of products in formal production. In April, 536 tons of coal tar were recovered, from which more than 9 tons of gasoline, more than 28 tons of kerosene, more than 51 tons of light and heavy diesel oil, as well as a large amount of crude phenol, asphalt, and anti-corrosion oil products were extracted.

The Huainan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, based on the characteristics of Huainan's high coal oil content and large coke production capacity, launched a coal comprehensive utilization movement in March centered on oil (coal tar), gas (coal gas), chemicals (chemical products), and water (ammonia and phenol-containing sewage). Party organization secretaries at all levels took the lead, establishing leadership structures at all levels, and widely mobilizing the masses, which led to the rapid development of the movement. Coke plants have successively modified oil passages, built chimneys, and increased oil extraction equipment, resulting in rapid growth in coal tar production. After the Huainan Coke Plant increased the oil passage and changed the cooler from single to double and the cooling tube from thin to thick, the oil extraction rate of 30 furnaces in the plant increased from the original 0.11% to 2.94%. The Wuwei Coke Plant created a method of high chimneys, earthen pipelines, and long-flowing water for oil extraction, which greatly increased the average oil extraction rate of the plant's 18 coking furnaces. Currently, all coking furnaces in the city are producing oil, and more than ten kinds of indigenous and foreign oil extraction methods have emerged. The oil extraction rate in April increased by 238.9% compared to the average oil extraction rate in the first quarter.

The processing of coal tar and the trial production and production of various chemical products are also being carried out vigorously throughout the city. The city has established 13 coal oil processing plants and a coal refining plant with an annual output of 5,000 tons, and has produced a large number of 11 varieties such as gasoline, kerosene, and light and heavy diesel oil. Various units have also established some small-scale chemical plants for comprehensive utilization of coal by indigenous methods, and have trial-produced more than 50 kinds of chemical products such as quinoline, benzene, carbazole, and pyridine. In addition, a 10,000-ton low-temperature carbonization plant has been established in the city, and the plant's plastics and lubricating oil workshops will be put into production one after another starting in June.

In vigorously promoting the comprehensive utilization of coal, Huainan City has conscientiously implemented the policy of self-reliance, indigenous methods, and a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, so the action is fast and the effect is great. At present, coal mines, factories, institutions, and schools throughout the city are continuing to build new plants and furnaces, while summarizing the experience of existing plants and furnaces, in order to further promote the movement.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin Dispatch: The Mudanjiang Paper Mill has developed from a single paper mill into a comprehensive enterprise that both makes paper and refines iron.

For more than a year, the Iron Smelting Branch of this factory has overfulfilled the pig iron plan month by month and quarter by quarter, becoming a red flag of small blast furnaces in Mudanjiang City and Heilongjiang Province. In terms of papermaking, it has also continued to leap forward year after year. In 1958, when the Iron Smelting Branch was founded, paper production increased by 20% compared to 1957. In 1959, it completed the national plan 19 days ahead of schedule. The first quarter of this year also completed the first quarter plan ahead of schedule, and paper production increased by 45.16% compared to the same period last year.

The "small foreign group" of iron and steel in the Mudanjiang Paper Mill was established in 1958 during the mass steelmaking campaign. Under the strong leadership of the factory's Party committee, it has grown stronger. When the Iron Smelting Branch was first established, some people believed that the paper mill's involvement in steelmaking was "not doing its proper job" and "distracting leadership." The Party committee led all the workers in the factory to debate this erroneous idea, so that everyone realized that mass steelmaking, light industry also engaging in heavy industry, and walking on two legs are the fundamental policies for building socialism at high speed. Therefore, the Party committee decided: the Party committee secretary will continue to take the lead in vigorously grasping steel, and two other standing committee members will be specifically responsible for steel production. In winning high yields from small blast furnaces in the first quarter of this year, the Party committee also moved the enlarged meeting of the Party committee to the site of the Iron Smelting Branch, organized full factory support, and ensured high blast furnace yields.

Since the Mudanjiang Paper Mill established the Iron Smelting Branch, it has promoted the great development of the factory's production. The workers of the machine repair workshop participated in the mass steelmaking campaign, manufactured and installed a 13-cubic-meter blast furnace by themselves, broke superstition, transformed repair into manufacturing, and have manufactured two sets of three-meter-diameter steaming ball pulping equipment, solving the difficulty of insufficient pulping equipment in the factory. They also manufactured iron-wood structure papermaking machines and papermaking drying cylinder equipment to support the small paper mills in the Mudanjiang area. (Attached picture)

    淮南以炼焦为中心综合利用煤炭
    牡丹江造纸厂既造纸又炼铁
    据新华社合肥电　安徽省淮南市采取土法上马、土洋结合的办法，掀起了一个以炼焦为中心的大搞油、气、化、水的煤炭综合利用运动。到4月30日止，全市已建起四十五个煤炭综合利用工厂，正式生产的产品达三十六种。4月份回收煤焦油五百三十六吨，并从中提炼出九吨多汽油，二十八吨多煤油，五十一吨多轻重柴油，以及大量粗酚、沥青、防腐油等产品。
    中共淮南市委根据淮南煤炭含油率高、焦炭生产能力大等特点，3月份在全市开展了一个以煤焦为中心的油（煤焦油）、气（煤气）、化（化工产品）、水（含氨和酚的污水）的煤炭综合利用运动。由各级党组织书记挂帅，层层建立领导机构，并广泛动员群众，使运动迅速发展。各焦厂纷纷改油道、建烟囱、增加抽油设备，煤焦油产量增长很快。淮南焦厂增加了油道和把冷却器由单改双、冷却管由细改粗后，全厂有三十个炉出油率由原来的0.11％提高到了2.94％。无为焦厂创造了高烟囱、土管道、长流水抽油法，使全厂十八个炼焦炉平均出油率有了很大提高。现在，全市焦炉已做到炉炉出油，并出现了十多种土洋抽油法，4月份出油率比第一季度平均出油率提高238.9％。
    煤焦油的加工及各种化工产品的试制和生产也在全市轰轰烈烈展开。全市已建立了十三座煤油加工厂和一座年产五千吨的煤炼油厂，并已大量生产出汽油、煤油、轻重柴油等十一种品种。各单位还以土法上马的办法建立了一些小型煤炭综合利用的化工厂，并已试制成劬荼、苯、咔?、吡啶等化工产品五十多种。此外，市内还建立了一座万吨低温干馏厂，厂内塑料、润滑油等车间6月起将先后投入生产。
    淮南市在大搞煤炭综合利用中，认真贯彻了自力更生、土法上马、土洋结合的方针，因此行动快、效果大。目前，全市各煤矿、工厂、机关、学校，正一面继续建造新厂新炉，一面总结现有厂、炉的经验，以便把运动更向前推进一步。
    新华社哈尔滨电　牡丹江造纸厂已由单一的造纸厂发展成为既造纸又炼铁的综合性企业。
    一年多来，这个厂的炼铁分厂按月、按季地超额完成了生铁计划，成为牡丹江市和黑龙江省小高炉的一面红旗。造纸方面，也年年持续跃进，在创办炼铁分厂的1958年，纸张产量比1957年增长20％，1959年又提前十九天全面完成了国家计划；今年第一季度也提前完成了首季计划，纸张产量比去年同期增长45.16％。
    牡丹江造纸厂的钢铁“小洋群”，是在1958年全民大炼钢铁时开始建立的。在工厂党委的坚强领导下，它已日益成长壮大起来。开始建立炼铁分厂时，有的人曾经认为：造纸厂搞钢铁是“不务正业”、“分散领导精力”等等。党委领导全厂职工同这种错误思想进行了辩论，使大家认识到全民炼钢铁、轻工业也搞重工业、两条腿走路，是高速度建设社会主义的根本方针。因此，党委确定：继续由党委书记挂帅狠抓钢铁，另由两名常委具体分工负责钢铁生产。在今年一季度夺取小高炉高产中，党委还把党委扩大会议搬到炼铁分厂的现场去开，组织全厂大支援，确保高炉高产。
    牡丹江造纸厂从办起炼铁分厂以后，促进了全厂生产的大发展。机修车间职工参加大炼钢铁中，自己动手制造和安装出了十三立米高炉以后，破除迷信，变修理为制造，已经制造出了两台直径三米的蒸球制浆设备，解决了工厂制浆设备不足的困难。他们还制造出铁木结构的制纸机、造纸烘缸设备，支援了牡丹江地区的小造纸厂。（附图片）
