Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 17th. The CCP Liaoning Provincial Committee formed a 10,000-person inspection team and divided them into three routes to ten cities. They mobilized workers on the industrial, capital construction, transportation, and finance and trade fronts to conduct a major inspection, major summary, major evaluation, and major mobilization, launching a massive mass movement to rectify, consolidate, and improve production. They aim to push the vigorous production upsurge to a new peak and strive to complete half of the annual plan for the province's major industrial product output in the first half of the year.

This inspection team is personally led by Huang Huoqing, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, with Yang Chunfu and Li Dongye, Secretaries of the Provincial Party Committee Secretariat, and Jiao Ruoyu, Standing Committee Member of the Provincial Party Committee and First Secretary of the CCP Shenyang Municipal Committee, participating in the leadership. The 10,000-person inspection team is composed of cadres from the province, cities, and industrial and mining enterprises at three levels.

The CCP Liaoning Provincial Committee believes that the current situation on the province's industrial front is very good. Since the beginning of this year, great achievements have been made in industrial production, capital construction, transportation, and scientific research. The technical innovation and technical revolution movement is developing along the correct, scientific, and mass-based path. However, if we demand a higher level, the production plans of some units have not been completed satisfactorily, and the combination of technical innovation, technical revolution, and production is not close enough. There are also some problems in the leadership style of some cadres. Therefore, we must not be complacent in the slightest, and we must carry forward the spirit of continuous revolution, further boost our energy, and strive to complete half of the annual plan for the output of major industrial products in the first half of the year. Now that more than four months have passed in the first half of the year, time waits for no one, and we must seize the opportunity to immediately achieve a greater leap forward in production.

The CCP Liaoning Provincial Committee requires that this major inspection must focus on improving production, and all work must serve production. We must concentrate all our efforts to promote production. To this end, we must first vigorously grasp production during the inspection and immediately launch a large-scale battle to seize steel, specifically focusing on coal, pig iron, ore production, and transportation. We must carry out mass movements as we did in the battle to seize coal and steel last year. Secondly, we must vigorously grasp the popularization and promotion of new products, new technologies, and new experiences to achieve a large-scale harvest and closely integrate technical innovation and technical revolution with production, so that technical innovation is colorful and production is red every day, and the whole hall is red. Thirdly, through inspection, we must further improve the leadership style and resolutely implement the Party's policies, resolutions, and instructions. In our work, we must be bold and resolute, quick and decisive, do what we say, not delay overnight, and persevere to the end, so that the leadership's thinking and actions can catch up with the new leap forward situation.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan. Workers in various parts of Hubei Province have decided to focus on coal, iron, ore, and transportation to fight a major battle in May and June and vigorously carry out the industrial production increase movement.

In recent days, leading comrades from the CCP Hubei Provincial Committee, Wuhan Municipal Committee, and their affiliated departments, as well as the Party committees of various regions, cities, and counties, have led work teams to various places and gone deep into the front lines of production. Han Kehua, Director of the Provincial Party Committee's Industry Office, Zhang Yimin, Director of the Provincial Metallurgical Industry Department, and others led work teams to sit in the Echeng Iron and Steel Plant to assist the plant in solving production problems. Zhang Jinxian, Deputy Director of the Provincial Party Committee's Communications Department, and others led a work team of more than 20 people to go deep into Zhifang, Ma'anshan, and other places to inspect the construction of transportation, promoting the construction of five special railway lines for coal mines. A strong scientific and technical team of 915 people organized by Wuhan City, under the leadership of Comrade Song Yiping, Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, has already met at the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation.

Leaders going to the front lines and strengthening the front lines of production have not only further promoted and facilitated the transformation of the work style of cadres in factories and mines but have also greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of workers, enabling rapid breakthroughs in key production areas and a rapid rise in production levels. For example, the gas quality of Daye Steel Plant was poor in the past and had not been resolved for a long time, causing the rolling department to frequently wait for temperature and stop production. This time, the Party committee leaders went deep into the gas workshop and worked with the workers to study and establish a three-determination (fixed person, fixed equipment, fixed scope) system, unified the operation methods, and reduced the temperature of the gas furnace from the original 800 degrees to 550 degrees, ensuring normal production.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan. The competition movement launched by workers on the industrial front in Shanxi Province, which is determined to exceed the first quarter in the second quarter and fight a major battle in Red May, is sweeping through all industrial enterprises in the province. This movement is pushing the production and transportation of steel, iron, and coal to a new peak, and the output of various products is rising rapidly. Compared with before the start of the movement, the daily output of coal has increased by more than 20,000 tons, and the daily output of steel has increased by 15.6%.

In this movement, iron and steel workers took the lead, first proposing: Guarantee the double leap forward of steel and iron in the second quarter. The Party committee secretaries, factory directors, and workers of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, Guxian Iron and Steel Plant, Yangquan Iron and Steel Plant, and all the province's iron and steel "small indigenous groups" bases, like during the Great Leap Forward of steelmaking in 1958, ate and slept beside the furnaces, rushing to obtain raw materials and repairing the furnaces. Workers in various factories widely carried out large-scale skill competitions in various types of work. In just ten days of hard work, the total volume of small blast furnaces opened for production throughout the province increased from 2,680 cubic meters to 2,901 cubic meters. The daily steel production of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company has also greatly increased.

The workers of state-owned coal mines throughout the province, who had already launched the "coal to guarantee steel and iron" competition in March, grasped production and carried out innovation in this movement. Due to the implementation of the advanced experience of "no pit wood coal mining" by the Lu'an Mining Bureau, all coal mining work surfaces of the bureau have achieved coal mining without using pit wood, and the daily output of coal has increased from 3,200 tons to 4,100 tons.

The railway, highway, factory, mine, long-distance, and short-distance transportation units of the transportation system have all launched a "high-efficiency transportation" competition. Workers in various units participating in the competition have tried every means to actively improve transportation efficiency.

    狠抓煤炭、生铁、矿石、运输　促进工业生产更大跃进
    辽宁省书记挂帅组织万人大检查
    湖北大批干部开赴生产第一线　山西掀起二季超一季竞赛
    本报沈阳17日电　中共辽宁省委组成万人检查团分三路到十个市，发动工业、基本建设、交通运输、财贸战线的职工进行大检查、大总结、大评比、大动员，掀起一个声势浩大的整顿、巩固、提高生产的群众运动，把轰轰烈烈的生产高潮推向新高峰，力争全省主要工业产品产量在上半年完成全年计划的一半。
    这个检查团由省委第一书记黄火青同志亲自挂帅，省委书记处书记杨春甫、李东冶和省委常委、中共沈阳市委第一书记焦若愚等负责同志参加领导。万人检查团由省、市、工矿企业三级干部组成。
    中共辽宁省委认为，当前全省工业战线的形势很好。今年以来，不论工业生产、基本建设、交通运输和科学研究等方面，都取得了很大的成绩，技术革新和技术革命运动正沿着正确的科学的全民的轨道向前发展。但是，如果用更高的水平来要求，有些单位的生产计划完成得并不令人满意，技术革新、技术革命和生产结合得也不够紧密，在部分干部的领导作风方面也存在一些问题。因此，丝毫也不能自满，必须发扬不断革命的精神，进一步鼓足干劲，力争主要工业产品产量在上半年完成全年计划的一半。现在上半年已经过去四个多月，机不可失，时不再来，必须抓紧时机使生产立即实现更大幅度的跃进。
    中共辽宁省委要求，这次大检查，必须以提高生产为中心，一切工作都要为生产服务，要集中全力把生产促上去。为此，在检查中首先要狠抓生产，从现在开始立即开展一个大规模的夺钢大战，具体内容就是大抓煤炭、生铁、矿石生产和交通运输，要像去年夺煤、夺钢大战那样大搞群众运动。其次要大抓新产品、新技术、新经验的普及推广工作，实现大面积丰收，使技术革新和技术革命紧密结合生产，做到技术革新万紫千红，生产日日红、满堂红。再次，通过检查要进一步改进领导作风，坚决贯彻执行党的政策、决议和指示。在工作中要大刀阔斧，雷厉风行，说干就干，事不过夜，一抓到底，使领导思想和行动赶上新的跃进形势。
    据新华社武汉电　湖北省各地职工决定以煤、铁、矿石、运输为中心，大战5、6月，大力开展工业增产运动。
    连日来，中共湖北省委、武汉市委和所属各部门，以及各地、市、县委的领导同志，都纷纷率领工作组分赴各地，深入生产第一线。省委工业办公室主任韩克华、省冶金工业厅厅长张益民等，率领工作组坐镇鄂城钢铁厂，协助这个厂解决生产上的问题。省委交通部副部长张进先等率领的由二十多人组成的工作组，深入到纸坊、马鞍山等地检查交通修建情况，促进了五条煤矿专用铁路线的修建工作。武汉市组织的一个九百一十五人的强大科学技术队伍，在市委书记宋一平同志的率领下，已经在武钢会师。
    领导上前线，加强生产第一线，不仅进一步推动和促进了厂矿企业干部作风的转变，而且大大鼓舞了职工的生产热情，使生产关键迅速突破，生产水平迅速上升。如大冶钢厂过去煤气质量不好，长时间没有解决，造成轧钢部门经常待温停产，这次党委领导深入煤气车间与工人共同研究，建立了三定（定人、定设备、定范围）制度，统一了操作方法，使煤气炉的温度由原来八百度压缩到五百五十度，保证了正常生产。
    据新华社太原电　山西省工业战线职工掀起的定叫二季超一季，大战红五月的竞赛运动，正在席卷全省所有工业企业。这一运动把钢、铁、煤的生产和运输工作推向新的高峰，各项产品产量迅速上升。同运动开展以前相比，现在煤的日产量提高了两万多吨，钢的日产量提高了15.6％。
    在这一运动中钢铁职工一马当先，首先提出：保证二季钢、铁双跃进。太原钢铁公司、故县钢铁厂、阳泉钢铁厂和全省所有钢铁“小洋群”基地的党委书记、厂长和工人，像1958年大炼钢铁时一样，吃在炉旁、睡在炉旁，一面突击原料，一面检修炉子。各厂职工广泛开展了各工种大比武。仅仅十天的奋战，全省开炉生产的小高炉总容积，就由二千六百八十立方米增加到二千九百零一立方米。太原钢铁公司的日产钢量，也有很大提高。
    3月份就已展开了“以煤保钢保铁”竞赛的全省国营煤矿职工，在这一运动中一面抓生产，一面搞革新。潞安矿务局由于推行“无坑木采煤”先进经验，全局所有的采煤工作面都做到了采煤不用坑木，煤的日产量由三千二百吨一下提高到四千一百吨。
    交通运输系统的铁路、公路、厂矿和长途、短途运输单位，都展开了“高效率运输”竞赛，参加竞赛的各单位职工，想方设法地积极提高运输效率。
