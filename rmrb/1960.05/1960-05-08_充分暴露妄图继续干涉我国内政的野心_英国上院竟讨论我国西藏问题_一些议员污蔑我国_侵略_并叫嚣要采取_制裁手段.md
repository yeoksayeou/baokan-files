Xinhua News Agency, London, 6th May. The British House of Lords actually discussed the Tibet issue, which is purely China's internal affair, on the 5th. Some parliamentarians unscrupulously slandered China for carrying out "aggression" against its own territory of Tibet, and wantonly clamored for taking "sanctions," fully exposing the wild ambition of British imperialism to continue interfering in China's internal affairs.

    Pearson Dixon advocated in his speech that the British government should adopt a "more affirmative" attitude, that is, openly interfere in China's internal affairs, on the Tibet issue. He clamored that if the major powers believe that "no legitimate means of sanction can be found to intervene (in the Tibet issue), then a green light will be given to allow aggression all over the world." He also wants the British government to "play its role" in "organizing" anti-China "international public opinion." Dixon also praised the Indian authorities' attitude towards China, saying, "There is ample evidence that India has views on the Tibet issue." He said, "Britain does not have to worry in the future that any affirmative attitude Britain may take will be out of sync with India's views."

    Parliamentarian Alexander falsely accused China of "invading Tibet" and threatened in an imperialist tone that Britain "cannot sit idly by." He also supported the anti-China clamoring of some reactionaries in India and said in a threatening tone, "China should be told and firmly told that Britain supports India in resisting any territorial aggression against India by the Chinese Communist government."

    Birdwood, who initiated this discussion, actually put forward, according to imperialist logic, that only when China signs the Simla Treaty, in which Britain conspired to seize Tibet, can China be considered to have so-called "effective suzerainty" over Tibet, and that "Tibet is independent before China has done so." Birdwood falsely accused the agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet of being signed under some "extremely serious coercion."

    Sinha also defamed China's action to quell the Tibetan rebellion as "pure aggression."

    However, some parliamentarians also expressed sober opinions. Farringdon believed that "talking about the Chinese army invading (Tibet) is extremely ridiculous." He said: The Tibetan people "can now truly manage their own affairs and enjoy the fruits of their own labor for the first time."

    Jowitt said in his speech that Tibet is "the most backward" place in the world, and in Tibet, "most ordinary people" demand "freedom from monastic and feudal shackles and demand help." He also said that a social revolution is taking place in Tibet, and this revolution "is a broad struggle with people participating in it."

    However, the Under-Secretary of the British Foreign Office, Lansdowne, expressed disagreement with Jowitt and Farringdon's views. He greatly slandered the Chinese government's suppression of the Tibetan rebellion as so-called "suppressing national freedom and brutally attacking the historic life of a steadfastly friendly nation" and "destroying the structure of an ancient civilization." He also said that the British government was "greatly shocked" and "felt very saddened" by the Chinese government's suppression of the Tibetan rebellion.

    The motion to debate the Tibet issue has been withdrawn after discussion in the House of Lords.

    充分暴露妄图继续干涉我国内政的野心
    英国上院竟讨论我国西藏问题
    一些议员污蔑我国“侵略”并叫嚣要采取“制裁手段”
    新华社伦敦6日电　英国上院5日竟然讨论纯属中国内政的西藏问题。一些议员在会上放肆污蔑中国对自己领土西藏进行“侵略”，恣意叫嚣要采取“制裁手段”，充分暴露了英帝国主义妄图继续干涉中国内政的野心。
    皮尔逊·迪克逊在发言中主张英国政府在西藏问题上采取“更肯定”也就是明目张胆干涉中国的内政的态度。他叫嚣，如果各大国认为“找不到合法的制裁手段去干预（西藏问题），那么就在全世界开了准许侵略的绿灯”。他还要英国政府在“组织”反华“国际舆论上起它的作用”。迪克逊还赞赏印度当局对中国的态度说，“有充分的证据证明印度对西藏问题有意见”。他说，“英国今后不必担心，英国可能采取的任何肯定态度同印度的看法不合拍”。
    议员亚历山大诬蔑中国“侵略西藏”，并用帝国主义口吻恫吓说，英国“不能泰然处之”。他还支持印度的一些反动派的反华叫嚣，并用威胁口吻说，“应该告诉并且要坚定地告诉中国，英国是支持印度抵抗中国共产党政府在印度的任何领土侵略的”。
    发起这次讨论的伯德伍德在发言中按照帝国主义的逻辑，竟然提出，只有中国在英国阴谋攫取西藏的西姆拉条约上签了字，才能认为中国对西藏有所谓“有效的宗主权”，而在中国“没有这样做以前，西藏则是独立的”。伯德伍德诬蔑关于和平解放西藏办法的协议是在什么“极为严重的胁迫的情况下”签订的。
    辛哈也诽谤中国平定西藏叛乱的行动“纯系侵略”。
    但是也有一些议员发表了头脑清醒的意见。法林登认为，“谈论中国军队侵入（西藏）是极其可笑的事”。他说：西藏人民“现在第一次真正可以管理自己的事务和享受他们自己的劳动成果”。
    乔利在发言中说，西藏是“世界上最落后的”地方，在西藏，“大多数普通人”要求“摆脱寺院的和封建的枷锁并要求帮助”。他还说，西藏正在进行社会革命，这种革命“是一次有人民参加的广泛的斗争”。
    但是英国外交部次官兰斯当尼却表示不同意乔利和法林登的看法。他大肆诬蔑中国政府平定西藏叛乱是所谓“镇压民族自由和残暴地攻击一个坚定友好民族的有历史意义的生活”，是“摧毁一种古老文明的结构”。他还说，英国政府对于中国政府平定西藏叛乱“曾大为震动”，“感到非常悲痛”。
    关于辩论西藏问题的提案在上院讨论后已经撤销。
