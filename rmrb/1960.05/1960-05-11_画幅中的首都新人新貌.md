    New Faces of the Capital in Paintings
    Zhao Fengchuan
    The Beijing "May 1st" Art Exhibition has opened in the Painting Boat Studio of Beihai Park. The biggest feature of this art exhibition is that the artists have used various painting forms to prominently reflect the new face of socialist construction in the capital from different perspectives, reflect the urban people's communes, praise the liberation of women from housework to participate in production, and portray the heroic figures and advanced deeds of the new era.

    From the posters "Urban Communes, Ten Thousand Households are One Family," "Socialization of Housework, Concentrated on Production," "I'll Wash Everyone's Clothes," and the sketches "From Low Yield to High Yield, From Divided Mind to Single Mind," "Yesterday for Myself, Today for Everyone," "Line Connects Line, Heart Connects Heart," we can see the profound ideological changes in the broad masses of women after they were liberated from household affairs and participated in production.

    Works reflecting the new face of the capital and heroic figures include "For Powering the Capital" (traditional Chinese painting), "No Sullen Faces, Considerate to Passengers," "Opening Cangshan and Building Railways Amidst Jubilant Drums," "For Sixty-One Class Brothers" (comic strip and print), "A Red Banner of Electrical Workers," "The Party Branch Secretary of Nineteen Years – Li Tang" (comic strip), etc. These dazzling works are truly vigorous and vivid, full of spirit, making people feel inspired and encouraged.

    Why are there so many new and innovative works? The reason is that this creation took place during the new upsurge of the urban people's commune movement in the capital, when the broad masses were engaged in technical innovation and technical revolution, and the spiritual outlook of the people underwent profound changes, with countless advanced figures and heroic deeds emerging. It was truly a picturesque spring scene with flowers blooming everywhere. These moving and heroic scenes excited the artists. Under the guidance of the Party's literary and artistic thought, they threw themselves into the movement with great enthusiasm, going to street factories and service stations. They saw that yesterday they were still housewives, but today they are workers operating machines. Yesterday, they were not very concerned about national affairs, but now they actively participate in political study and various activities, and have begun to become laborers with socialist consciousness, culture, and technology. The artists realized that this is an extremely profound social revolution, an important symbol of the complete liberation of women. Therefore, in their creations, their first consideration was how to capture the profoundly meaningful theme, create with a high degree of ideological content, and how to achieve the goal of inspiring people's fighting will and playing an active educational role. With such motives and emotions, coupled with the usual training in skills, the works they created were not empty and exaggerated, but profound and powerful. Even if it was just a sketch, it had full emotional power.

    The above facts show that art creation is also changing with the leap forward of the socialist revolution. Why is it that some people in the past, although they had mastered quite high painting skills, still produced works that were so dry and tasteless even after spending half a year or several months on them? It was because they were outside the movement, outside the mass struggle, focusing only on technique and not on putting politics in command. These people also have a set of absurd theories. They say: "Cooperating with political movements will not produce good works, and hard cooperation can only produce some rough popular things. To produce permanent works, the time must be lengthened after the movement..." These fallacies are essentially about whether creation is for serving socialism and for serving politics. They emphasize permanent great works, emphasize improvement divorced from popularization, and separate artistic creation from serving the current political movement. If we continue to follow these people's fallacies, how can we talk about serving socialism? What is the point of real improvement? Many works in the exhibition are giving the most powerful response to these fallacies. The artists first recognized the revolutionary significance of the urban people's commune movement, immediately responded with great enthusiasm, and quickly threw themselves into the movement. They painted many high-quality works at the fastest speed. This fact proves that the length of creation time (including painting skills) is not the key to determining whether a work is good or bad. The key issue is what is the attitude of the artist towards the mass struggle and the great political movement? The fundamental issue is determined by the artist's ideology and worldview.

    It is also worth mentioning that a large number of new forces have emerged in this creative movement. Especially in the field of traditional Chinese painting, new forces have sprung up enthusiastically, and their works are full of fresh and powerful contemporary atmosphere. Such as "Contemporary Hero" (Dan Yinggui), "Drawing Water" (Ji Shenglang), "Manure Transport Map" (Tian Tonghong), etc. all reflect the new face of this boiling and leaping era with unrestrained and solid brushstrokes. They have enriched and developed the traditional Chinese painting forms in art, and expressed the spirit and splendor of the great era.

    画幅中的首都新人新貌   
    赵枫川
    北京市“五一”美展已在北海画舫斋开幕。这次美展最大的特色，是画家们运用了各种绘画的形式，从各个不同的角度，突出地反映了首都社会主义建设的新面貌，反映了城市人民公社，歌颂了广大妇女从家务劳动中解放出来参加生产，并刻划了新时代的英雄人物和先进事迹。
    从招贴画中“城市公社化，万户是一家”“家务劳动社会化，一心生产无二挂”“大家的衣服我来洗”、速写画中“低产变高产，多心变一心”“昨天为自己，今天为大家”“线连线，心连心”等作品都可以看出广大的妇女们由家庭事务中解放出来，参加生产后思想上的深刻变化。
    反映首都新面貌及英雄人物的作品有“为了向首都发电”（国画）“不卖苦脸票，体贴乘客心”“开苍山修铁路锣鼓喧天”“为了六十一个阶级弟兄”（连环画和版画）“电业工人的一面红旗”“十九年的党支部书记——李堂”（连环画）等。这些满目琳琅的作品，真是气势生动，神韵飞舞，使人看了，能感到一种振奋和鼓舞。
    为什么会产生这样多而内容新颖的作品呢？原因在于这次创作正是首都城市人民公社进入新的高潮，广大群众大闹技术革新和技术革命的时候，人们的精神面貌发生了深刻的变化，涌现了无数先进人物和英雄事迹，真是春色如画、满园花开。这些动人的豪迈景象，激动着画家。在党的文艺思想指导下，他们抱着极大的热情，投入到运动中去，到街道工厂、到服务站，他们看见昨天还是家庭妇女，今天却是操作机器的工人了。昨天还是不大关心国家大事，现在积极参加政治学习和各种活动，开始成为有社会主义觉悟的、有文化技术的劳动者了。画家们认识到了，这是一个极为深刻的社会革命，是广大妇女走向彻底解放的重要标志。因此，在创作时他们首先考虑的是如何抓取深刻意义的主题，用高度的思想性进行创作，如何能达到鼓舞人们的战斗意志，起积极的教育作用。画家们有了这样的动机和情感，再加上平时对技巧的磨练，画出来的作品，就不是空泛浮夸，而是深刻有力了。虽然有的只是一幅速写，却具有充分的感人力量。
    以上这些事实说明了，美术创作随着社会主义革命的跃进，也正在发生着变化。为什么过去有些人虽然掌握了相当高的绘画技巧，一幅作品画了半年或几个月，还是那么干瘪无味呢？就是由于他们置身运动之外，置身于群众斗争之外，只讲技术，没有政治挂帅的结果。这些人还有一套荒谬的理论，他们说：“配合政治运动就画不出好作品，硬配合也只能画一些粗糙的普及东西，要想产生永久性的作品，必须运动过后，时间放长些……”这些谬论，实质上就是创作为不为社会主义服务，为不为政治服务的问题，他们强调永久性的大作品，强调脱离普及的提高，他们把提高与普及割裂开来，把美术创作为当前的政治运动服务脱离开来。如果照这些人的谬论做下去，还谈得上什么为社会主义服务？有什么真正的提高呢？展览中的许多作品正给这些谬论以最有力的回击，画家们首先认识了城市人民公社运动的革命意义，立即报以极大热情，迅速地投入了运动，他们以最快速度画出了不少质量较高的作品。这一事实就证明了创作时间的长短（包括绘画技巧）并不是决定一幅作品好坏的关键，关键问题，在于画家对群众斗争，对伟大的政治运动的态度如何？根本问题是决定于画家的思想和世界观。
    还值得一提的是在这次创作运动中，又涌现了大批的新生力量。尤其在国画方面，新生力量踊跃倍出，他们的作品充满了新鲜有力的时代气息。如“当代英雄”（单应桂）、“汲”（即声朗）、“运肥图”（天同红）等。都以奔放坚实的笔锋，反映了这个沸腾跃进时代的新面貌。在艺术上丰富和发展了民族传统的绘画形式，表现了伟大时代的精神和光彩。
