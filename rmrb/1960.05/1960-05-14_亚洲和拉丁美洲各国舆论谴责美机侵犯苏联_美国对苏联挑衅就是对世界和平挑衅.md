(Comprehensive report from our newspaper) Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Public opinion in Asian and Latin American countries has widely condemned the provocative act of American planes intruding into Soviet airspace.

    The Burmese "Kyemon" newspaper stated in an editorial that American generals are carrying out military preparations against the Soviet Union for their own selfish gains. The editorial said that the vicious plans of American generals, who thirst for the blood of people around the world, will be opposed by the American people.

    The "Myanmar Alin" newspaper said in an editorial, "Who among the people of the world, who love peace, will believe their solemn words of peace and serious disarmament plans after the American leaders were caught red-handed in an extremely faithless action against not only the Russian people but all peace-loving people?" The newspaper also pointed out, "When the US government had to admit a few days ago that they were conducting espionage activities over Russia, the US's standing in the eyes of the whole world has never fallen so low."

    The Indonesian "Rakjat" newspaper published an editorial on the 11th, stating that this incident proves the aggressive nature of the United States and demonstrates the Soviet Union's determination to defend world peace.

    The editorial pointed out that if imperialists are allowed to violate the territory of other countries, they will become even more rampant, and the danger of war will expand. The editorial also said that the Soviet Union's downing of this plane was an act of peace. This action has put those who attempt to make the summit conference fail in an extremely embarrassing position.

    The "Bintang Timur" newspaper also published an editorial on the 11th on this incident, pointing out that the occurrence of this incident on the eve of the summit conference shows that the United States has political motives, namely, to attempt to make the summit conference fail.

    The editorial pointed out that the sophistry of the US State Department and Eisenhower's military advisor Stassen is futile; conclusive evidence is speaking for itself.

    The Pakistani "Today's News" said in an editorial on the 10th that the Soviet Union's downing of the American plane that violated Soviet airspace for espionage activities and the interrogation of the American pilot were completely correct.

    The newspaper pointed out that this proves that American warmongers do not want to ease international tensions.

    The Cuban "Revolución" newspaper published an editorial on the 11th, stating that the American plane's spy flight over Soviet territory is a "preparation for aggression or an act of aggression." The title of this editorial is: "A New Move to Sabotage World Peace."

    The editorial pointed out, "The provocative tactics of the American warmongering clique are the same everywhere; the recent incident of the American plane being shot down over Soviet territory proves this point." The editorial continued, "To us Cubans, this extraordinary event, which has aroused the righteous indignation of all honest people in the world, is entirely possible because these planes appear every day over our island."

    "Revolución" finally called on the people and public opinion of the world to mobilize to block the clutches of warmongers.

    The Cuban "Hoy" newspaper pointed out in an editorial that the American plane's intrusion into Soviet airspace "is a crime against all mankind, a near-mad provocation, which is the policy that Herter shamelessly and arrogantly admitted. Herter has completely maintained the approach of Foster Dulles, putting the world on the edge of war every minute." "The simultaneous outbreak of condemnation everywhere in the world also involves the continued aggression against Cuba." "Hoy" emphasized, "This proves that the cause of peace and the struggle for the rights of the people are one. When Premier Khrushchev asked the American imperialists three days ago to stop their provocations against the people of all countries, this was both a warning against provocations against the Soviet Union and a warning against the conspiracy to invade Cuba. Therefore, the universal condemnation of American policy will be assistance to our country."

    The "Jornal do Brasil" published an article on the 10th, commenting on the shameful incident of the American plane intruding into the Soviet Union. The article said that the international prestige of the United States has been greatly reduced. The newspaper also said that the decline in the international prestige of the United States is also due to its planned propaganda campaign to slander the Cuban revolution. The newspaper believes that this propaganda campaign is despicable.

    The Uruguayan "El Popular" newspaper published an editorial pointing out that the American plane incident is the most shameless provocation and a serious crime that threatens world peace. The editorial said that the network of military bases established around the Soviet Union is not for flight performances, nor is it for studying atmospheric changes. These bases are for preparing for war and carrying out aggression.

    亚洲和拉丁美洲各国舆论谴责美机侵犯苏联
    美国对苏联挑衅就是对世界和平挑衅
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：亚洲和拉丁美洲各国舆论纷纷谴责美国飞机侵犯苏联的挑衅行动。
    缅甸“镜报”在社论中指出，美国将军们针对苏联进行军事准备，是为了谋取私利。社论说，渴嗜世界人民鲜血的美国将军们的恶毒计划将遭到美国人民的反对。
    “缅甸新时代报”在社论中说，最高级会议即将在巴黎举行，“在美国领袖进行一个不仅反对俄国人民而且反对爱好和平的各国人民的极无信义的行动中被当场抓住后不久，世界各国人民中间有谁会相信他们的庄严的和平言词和严肃的裁军计划呢？”这家报纸还指出，“当美国政府在几天前不得不承认他们在俄国上空进行间谍活动时，美国的地位在全世界的眼中从来没有跌落得这样低下。”
    印度尼西亚“人民日报”11日发表社论说，这个事件证明了美国的侵略本质，并且表明了苏联保卫世界和平的决心。
    社论指出，如果允许帝国主义者侵犯其它国家的领土，他们就会更加猖狂，战争的危险就会扩大。社论又说，苏联击落这架飞机是一种和平的行动。这个行动使那些企图使最高级会议失败的人处境极为狼狈。
    “东星报”11日也就这个事件发表社论指出，在最高级会议前夕发生这个事件，说明美国是抱着政治目的的，即企图使最高级会议失败。
    社论指出，美国国务院和艾森豪威尔的军事顾问史塔生强辞夺理，是徒然的，确凿的证据正在讲话。
    巴基斯坦“今天报”在10日的社论中说，苏联击落侵犯苏联领空进行间谍活动的美国飞机和对美国飞行员进行审讯的做法是完全对的。
    报纸指出，这证明，美国战争贩子并不希望缓和国际紧张局势。
    古巴“革命报”11日发表社论说，美国飞机在苏联领土上空作间谍飞行，这是一种“侵略的准备或是侵略的举动”。这篇社论的标题是：“破坏世界和平的新举动”。
    社论指出，“美国好战集团的挑衅策略在世界各地都是一样的，最近美国飞机在苏联领土上空被击落这一事件证明了这一点。”社论又说，“在我们古巴人看来，这个激起世界上一切正直人们的正当义愤的异乎寻常的事是完全可能干得出来的，因为这些飞机每天都在我们岛屿的上空出现。”
      “革命报”最后号召世界各国人民和舆论动员起来挡住战争贩子的魔爪。
    古巴“今日报”在社论中指出，美国飞机侵犯苏联领空“是对全人类犯下的罪行，是近乎疯狂的挑衅，这就是赫脱无耻和傲慢地承认了的政策。赫脱完整无缺地保持了福斯特·杜勒斯的方针，使世界每一分钟都处在战争的边缘”。“目前在世界各个地方同时爆发的谴责也涉及到了对古巴的继续不断的侵略。”“今日报”强调说，“这就证明，和平和争取人民权利的事业也是一个。当赫鲁晓夫总理三天前要求美帝国主义者停止他们对各国人民的挑衅时，这既是警告对苏联的挑衅，也是警告侵略古巴的阴谋。因此，对美国政策的普遍谴责将是对我国的援助。”
      “巴西日报”10日发表文章，评论美国飞机侵犯苏联的可耻事件。文章说，美国的国际威信已经大为低落。报纸又说，美国的国际威信的低落，还由于它的有计划的诋毁古巴革命的宣传运动。报纸认为，这种宣传运动是卑鄙的。
    乌拉圭“人民报”发表社论指出，美国飞机事件是最无耻的挑衅，是威胁世界和平的严重罪行。社论说，在苏联周围建立的军事基地网不是为了进行飞行表演，也不是为了研究大气变化。这些基地是为了准备战争和进行侵略活动。
