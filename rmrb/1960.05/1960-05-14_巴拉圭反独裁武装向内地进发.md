    Xinhua News Agency, Asuncion, May 13th: The anti-dictatorial armed forces that entered Paraguay from the southeast at the end of April, after successfully attacking the government troops in Puerto Presidente Stroessner, are now advancing inland. This force of about eighty people is led by Captain Speratti.
    At the same time, three other anti-dictatorial armed forces entered the Paraguayan interior through the eastern and northern borders. The force of over one hundred people, led by Major Rotela, that entered from the east has advanced through the Mayor Otaño port area on the Paraná River toward the Caaguazú mountains and forests. The other two forces, led by Captain Valdes and Captain Candido Rotela respectively, totaling over one hundred and fifty people, after attacking Captain Bado city and Pedro Juan Caballero city in Concepción province, are advancing toward the central eastern region.
    According to Paraguayan anti-dictatorial exiles, these armed forces, led by the Paraguayan "May 14th Movement," will establish bases to launch guerrilla warfare, and combine with other forms of struggle by the Paraguayan people, to fight together for the overthrow of the Stroessner dictatorial regime.
    Although the dictatorial government has propagandized that it has suppressed this anti-dictatorial armed struggle, the struggle is actually continuing. It is reported that the armed forces entering from the southeast injured the dictatorial government's warship "Colonel Martinez" on the Paraná River; the armed forces entering from the north once occupied towns such as Villa Curuguaty and Ygatimi.
    Currently, guerrilla activity is also taking place in the Villarrica region, 150 kilometers from the capital Asuncion. In the Caaguazú mountains, a dictatorial government aircraft was shot down by local guerrillas on May 5th.

    巴拉圭反独裁武装向内地进发
    新华社13日讯　亚松森消息：4月底从巴拉圭东南部入境的反独裁武装，在胜利地袭击了卡洛斯·安东尼奥·洛佩斯港的政府军以后，目前正向内地进发。这一支约八十多人的武装是由斯佩拉蒂上尉率领的。
    同时，另有三支反独裁武装通过东部和北部边境进入巴拉圭内地。从东部进入的由罗特拉少校率领的一百多人的武装，已经通过巴拉那河的马约尔奥塔诺港地区向卡瓜苏山地和森林地带挺进。另两支分别由瓦尔德斯上尉和坎迪多·罗特拉上尉率领的共一百五十多人的武装，在袭击了公塞普森省的巴多上尉城和佩德罗·胡安·卡瓦列罗城以后，正向东部地区中心前进。
    消息说，据巴拉圭反独裁的流亡人士指出，这些由巴拉圭“五月十四日运动”领导的武装将建立基地发动游击战争，和巴拉圭人民的其他各种形式的斗争结合起来，共同为推翻斯特罗斯纳独裁政权而斗争。
    尽管独裁政府宣传说它已经把这次反独裁武装斗争镇压下去，但实际上斗争正在继续开展。据报道，从东南部入境的武装曾在巴拉那河击伤了独裁政府的“马丁内斯上校”号军舰；从北部入境的武装曾一度占领了维利亚库鲁瓜蒂和伊加蒂米等城镇。
    目前在距首都亚松森一百五十公里的维拉利卡地区也有游击队活动。在卡瓜苏山地，独裁政府的一架飞机在5日被当地游击队击落。
