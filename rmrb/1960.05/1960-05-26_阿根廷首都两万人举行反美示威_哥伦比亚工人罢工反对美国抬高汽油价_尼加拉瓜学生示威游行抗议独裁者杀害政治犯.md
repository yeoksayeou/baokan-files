Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, May 24th: Twenty thousand Argentinians, holding aloft blazing torches and shouting resounding slogans for national liberation and "Yankees Go Home," paraded through the central streets of the capital tonight. The parade was organized by the Argentine University Federation to celebrate the 150th anniversary of Argentina's May Revolution. The Argentine people regard today's anti-imperialist struggle as a continuation of the struggle against Spanish colonialism in May 1810.
	The marching column, called "People's March for National Liberation," was five kilometers long. They shouted slogans such as "Yankees are destroying Latin America," "Release political prisoners and imprisoned workers," "Democracy, Democracy," and opposed the oppression of the International Monetary Fund and the Franco regime. The placards carried by the marchers read "National Liberation" and "Cuba will never become another Guatemala." As the parade passed the U.S. Embassy, the demonstrators whistled for a long time and shouted slogans such as "Yankees Go Home," "Long Live the Cuban Revolution," "We want Cuba, not Yankees," and "We don't want to become a colony." People on the street responded with enthusiastic cheers.
	The marchers also demanded the release of all political prisoners and arrested workers, the lifting of martial law, the abolition of the "Conintes Plan" (declaring a state of emergency throughout the country), and the cessation of torture of political prisoners.
	In recent days, various parties have issued statements condemning the government for holding celebrations of the 150th anniversary of the May Revolution under martial law and other repressive measures. At a celebratory demonstration organized by Liberal Conservative Party members last night, participants also condemned the Franco, Trujillo, and Stroessner regimes.
	Xinhua News Agency, Bogotá, May 24th: Colombian workers are holding a strike to protest the authorities' increase of gasoline prices by ten cents per gallon, at the instigation of U.S. oil monopoly organizations.
	Starting at midnight on May 23rd, workers in the urban transportation industry in Cali, western Colombia, began a general strike. Hundreds of demonstrators took to the streets, demanding that the government cancel the decision to raise gasoline prices, which was orchestrated by U.S. oil monopoly organizations, because raising gasoline prices will cause commodity prices to rise generally, further exacerbating the poverty of the people.
	Transportation workers in the province of Caldas in southeastern Colombia held a general strike on the 22nd.
	Currently, the movement against the U.S.-capital directed gasoline price increase continues to develop in the cities of Medellín, Barranquilla, and Bogotá. Colombian students have also joined the struggle.
	Xinhua News Agency, May 25th: San José dispatch: Students at the University of León in Nicaragua recently held a demonstration to protest the dictator Somoza's crimes of killing political prisoners.
	According to Orlando Navárez, a Nicaraguan political exile who fled to San José, the capital of Costa Rica, the Nicaraguan dictatorial government, acting on the orders of Anastasio Somoza, son of the deceased dictator and head of the Nicaraguan National Guard, recently killed three political prisoners in the Managua Air Force Prison. This brutal incident has aroused great public indignation. Faced with this brutal crime, Nicaraguans in exile in Costa Rica are uniting to strengthen the struggle against the Somoza dictatorship.

    新华社布宜诺斯艾利斯24日电　两万阿根廷人今晚高举着熊熊的火把、高呼争取民族解放和“美国佬滚回去”的响亮口号，在首都中心大街游行示威。这次游行是阿根廷大学生联合会为庆祝阿根廷五月革命一百五十周年纪念而举行的。阿根廷人民把今天的反帝国主义斗争当作1810年5月反对西班牙殖民主义斗争的继续。
    这支名为“争取民族解放人民进军”的游行队伍，长达五公里。他们高呼“美国佬正在摧毁拉丁美洲”、“释放政治犯和被囚禁的工人”、“民主、民主”和反对国际货币基金组织的压迫、反对佛朗哥政权的口号。在游行队伍携带的标语牌上写着“民族解放”、“古巴决不会变成危地马拉第二”。当游行队伍经过美国大使馆门前时，示威者长时间地吹口哨，并高呼“美国佬滚回去”、“古巴革命万岁”、“要古巴不要美国佬”、“我们不希望变成殖民地”等口号。街上的人对他们报以热烈的欢呼。
    游行者还要求释放一切政治犯和被捕的工人、取消戒严状态、废除“科宁特斯计划”（宣布全国处于紧急状态）和停止酷刑拷打政治犯。
    在这几天，不同党派纷纷发表声明，谴责政府在戒严状态和其它镇压措施下举行五月革命一百五十周年的庆祝活动。在昨天晚间举行的由自由保守党人士组织的庆祝示威中，参加者还谴责佛朗哥、特鲁希略和斯特罗斯纳政权。
    新华社波哥大24日电　哥伦比亚工人群众正在举行罢工斗争，反对美国石油垄断组织授意当局把每加仑汽油价格提高十分。
    23日早晨零时起，哥伦比亚西部卡利市的城市交通业工人开始举行总罢工。数以百计的示威群众走上大街，要求政府取消由美国石油垄断组织所策划的汽油涨价的决定，因为提高汽油的价格将使商品价格普遍上涨，使人民的贫困状况更加恶化。
    哥伦比亚东南部卡尔达斯省运输工人在22日举行了总罢工。
    目前，反对美国资本指使的汽油涨价的运动正在美得林、巴兰基雅和波哥大城市继续发展中。哥伦比亚的学生群众也参加了这次斗争。
    新华社25日讯　圣约瑟消息：尼加拉瓜雷翁大学的学生最近举行了示威游行，抗议独裁者索摩查杀害政治犯的罪行。
    据逃亡到哥斯达黎加首都圣约瑟的尼加拉瓜政治流亡者奥尔兰多·纳瓦埃斯透露，尼加拉瓜独裁政府根据已故独裁者的儿子、尼加拉瓜国民警卫队首脑安纳乌西奥·索摩查的命令，最近在马那瓜空军监狱杀害了三名政治犯。这一残暴的事件引起了公众的极大愤慨。面对着这个残暴的罪行，流亡在哥斯达黎加的尼加拉瓜人正在团结起来，准备加强反对索摩查独裁政权的斗争。
