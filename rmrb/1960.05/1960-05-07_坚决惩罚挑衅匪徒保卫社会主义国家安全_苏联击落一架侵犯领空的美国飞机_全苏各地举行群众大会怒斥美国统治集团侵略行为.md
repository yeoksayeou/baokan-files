Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 6th - The Soviet "Pravda" today reported the incident of May 1st in which a unit of the Soviet air defense forces shot down an American aircraft that had invaded Soviet airspace.

The newspaper said that as the morning of "May Day" was just dawning, a unit of the Soviet air defense forces issued an alert. As usual, the soldiers immediately prepared to carry out their combat mission. They possessed powerful technical equipment to defend the motherland's airspace. The radar antennas began to rotate, and radio personnel received information that an unidentified aircraft was intruding into Soviet airspace from the south. After a few minutes, the situation became clearer: a foreign aircraft had invaded Soviet airspace with hostile intentions. The American aircraft was flying very high, at a speed of approximately 900 kilometers per hour. The aircraft's course was clearly displayed on the screen.

The newspaper said that the order was given: "Destroy the enemy aircraft." The soldiers were all prepared to carry out this mission. Everyone believed that the sophisticated and powerful technical equipment would not let the enemy escape. Before long, the enemy aircraft was hit.

The newspaper said that after the American aircraft was shot down, the soldiers said: the bandits received the punishment they deserved, and anyone who invades Soviet airspace will suffer the same fate. We have the strength to defend the borders of our motherland and keep them inviolable.

Residents of a village near the unit of the air defense forces quickly helped the soldiers find the wreckage of the American aircraft.

On the 5th, after the soldiers of this unit heard the report made by Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers Khrushchev at the Soviet Supreme Soviet session, they immediately held a rally. Soldiers stepped onto the podium one after another, warmly thanking the Soviet Communist Party and the government for their high evaluation of them.

Major Voronov, the commander, represented all officers and soldiers in expressing to the Party and the government that the soldiers would vigilantly defend the motherland's airspace and tirelessly strengthen the armed forces.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 6th - The provocative actions of the American aircraft invading Soviet airspace twice have aroused immense anger among the Soviet people. At mass rallies held throughout the country, the Soviet people unanimously condemned this shameless act of aggression by the American ruling clique.

At a mass rally in the tool workshop of the Likhachev Automobile Factory in Moscow, lathe operator Soloviev said that the American adventurers sent planes to violate our airspace, and we Soviet workers express our great anger at this. The Soviet people resolutely defend world peace and unanimously support the measures taken by the Soviet government to defend the security of the motherland.

Borisov, a worker at the Leningrad Stalin Metal Factory, said that the Soviet people are closely watching the attempts of the American imperialists to exacerbate the international situation. He said that the workers of Leningrad unanimously protested against this provocative act by American imperialism, and they unanimously supported Comrade Khrushchev's speech on this issue at the Fifth Session of the Soviet Supreme Soviet.

Shatilov, a worker at the Berezovo State Farm in the Altai Krai, said that the Soviet people are engaged in the peaceful construction of communism, but the aggressors should also know that the Soviet people are not afraid of anyone's intimidation. If anyone dares to offend the Soviet people, they will suffer a fatal blow.

Mass rallies were also held in a unit of the Soviet air defense forces that shot down the American aircraft. The soldiers stated at the meeting that they must continue to maintain a high degree of vigilance and give any aggressor who dares to invade Soviet airspace a fatal blow.
