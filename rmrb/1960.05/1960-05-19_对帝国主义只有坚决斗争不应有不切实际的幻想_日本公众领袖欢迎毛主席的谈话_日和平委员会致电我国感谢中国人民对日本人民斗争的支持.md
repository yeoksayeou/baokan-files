Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 18th: Japanese public figures Ikuo Yasui and Akira Iwai issued statements, expressing gratitude to the Chinese people for supporting the Japanese people's struggle against the aggressive Japan-U.S. military alliance, welcoming Chairman Mao's speech on May 14th, and condemning the United States for sabotaging the summit conference.
    Ikuo Yasui, director of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, said that the mass demonstrations held by the Chinese people across the country are a support for the Japanese people's struggle, and at the same time a concrete manifestation of the Chinese people's will to wage a resolute struggle against the common enemy of the world's people, U.S. imperialism. Yasui emphasized that Chairman Mao's remarks on the international situation are completely correct, and in order to strive for world peace, the Japanese people must strengthen their struggle against U.S. imperialism and Japanese reactionaries.
    Akira Iwai, Secretary-General of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, expressed heartfelt gratitude to the Chinese people for supporting the Japanese people's patriotic struggle against U.S. imperialism with unprecedented large-scale demonstrations.
    Iwai emphasized that Chairman Mao's remarks in Wuhan were timely and will encourage the people of Asia and Africa in their struggle against the common enemy, U.S. imperialism.
    Regarding the East-West summit meeting, Yasui expressed support for the measures taken by the Soviet government. Yasui pointed out that as long as U.S. imperialist acts of sabotaging peace, such as the U-2 spy plane reconnaissance of the Soviet Union, continue, the summit meeting cannot achieve success. Yasui emphasized that this incident proves that the truth that only by resolutely struggling against imperialism can world peace be maintained is irrefutable.
    Yasui said that in the future, the war provocations of U.S. imperialism and Japanese reactionaries will certainly become even more intensified, but I believe that the people's struggle will surely triumph.
    Iwai said that it is regrettable that the East-West summit meeting has been postponed, but the full responsibility for this should be borne by the U.S. side. Iwai pointed out that, as Chairman Mao pointed out, there should be no unrealistic illusions about imperialism.
    Xinhua News Agency, May 18th: The Chinese People's Committee for World Peace Defense today received a telegram from the Japanese Peace Committee thanking the Chinese people for their support of the Japanese people's just struggle against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." The Japanese Peace Committee's telegram said: "The Chinese people's struggle in various places to support the Japanese people's struggle against the Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty' has greatly encouraged the Japanese people who are fighting in a decisive stage.
    "We would like to express our gratitude for the continuing joint struggle of the people of Japan and China against the U.S. imperialists and the Nobusuke Kishi government."

    日和平委员会致电我国感谢中国人民对日本人民斗争的支持
    据新华社18日讯　东京消息：日本公众领袖安井郁和岩井章发表谈话，表示感谢中国人民支持日本人民反对侵略性日美军事同盟的斗争，欢迎毛主席在5月14日的谈话，并且谴责美国破坏最高级会议。
    日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会理事长安井郁说，中国人民在全国举行大示威是对日本人民的斗争的支援，同时是中国人民针对世界人民共同敌人美帝国主义展开坚决斗争的意志的具体表现。安井郁强调指出，毛主席对国际局势发表的谈话是完全正确的，为了争取世界和平，日本人民必须加强进行对美帝国主义和日本反动派的斗争。
    日本工会总评议会事务局长岩井章对中国人民以空前规模的大示威支援日本人民反对美帝国主义的爱国斗争，表示衷心的感谢。
    岩井章强调指出，毛主席在武汉发表的谈话是适时的，它将鼓舞亚非各国人民对共同敌人美帝国主义的斗争。
    关于东西方首脑会议问题，安井郁表示支持苏联政府所采取的措施。安井郁指出，只要像U—2型飞机侦察苏联这种美帝国主义破坏和平的行为在继续，首脑会议是不能够取得成就的。安井郁强调指出，这一事情证明，只有同帝国主义坚决展开斗争才能维护世界和平这个真理是颠扑不破的。
    安井郁说，今后美帝国主义和日本反动派的战争挑衅一定更加变本加厉，但是我相信人民的斗争必将胜利。
    岩井章说，东西方首脑会议延期召开这是很遗憾的事，但它的全部责任应由美国方面承担。岩井章指出，正如毛主席所指出的那样，对帝国主义不应当存有不切实际的幻想。
    新华社18日讯　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会今天收到了日本和平委员会感谢我国人民支援日本人民反对日美“安全条约”正义斗争的电报。日本和平委员会的电报说：“中国人民在各地所展开的支援日本人民反对日美‘安全条约’的斗争，对在决定性阶段中斗争着的日本人民给予了很大的鼓励。
    “为了日中两国人民继续反对美帝国主义者和岸信介政府的共同斗争，谨致谢意。”
