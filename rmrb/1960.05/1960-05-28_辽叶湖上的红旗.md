Party Committee Secretary's Notes

	Red Flag on Liaoye Lake
	Yan Huaizhi, First Secretary of the CCP Zhuxi County Committee, Hubei Province

	Liaoye Lake is more than 2,400 meters above sea level. The mountains are high and the weather is cold, with constant clouds and fog. Wild animals roam even in broad daylight. Coupled with the exploitation by the Kuomintang and feudal landlords in the past, the lives of the peasants were even more miserable. Some moved out of the mountains, and some wandered to other places. Of the 46 households in the whole village, only 13 remained by the time of liberation.

	Now there have been earth-shaking changes here. In 1959, the total income from agriculture and sideline production here averaged 444 yuan per household. After setting aside enough seeds and feed from the grain harvested, the average person still had 1,292 catties. Every family has savings, and every household has stored grain. New schools, hospitals, shops, sewing shops, etc., have been built by the people, and a small power station is also under construction. Every household is beaming with joy. People say, "If it weren't for the Communist Party's leadership, Liaoye Lake would never have been able to turn over for thousands of years. Brother Dai has put his heart and soul into our commune members." The Brother Dai they are referring to is Dai Fujun, the Party Branch Secretary and Production Team Leader of the Liaoye Production Team, Xiasanba Management District, Fengxi Commune. For ten years, the ten cadres led by him have been working hard, honestly and selflessly, following the Party's instructions, relying on the masses, and changing the face of Liaoye Lake.

	In the year of cooperativization, the Party proposed that mountainous areas should vigorously develop diversified operations on the basis of having enough food to eat and surplus. Dai Fujun was enlightened when he heard this. He thought, "Yes! With grain, people have food to eat, pigs have feed, and they can do anything when they are full." He then convened a meeting of cadres to study and consulted with the old farmers to find ways to harvest more grain.

	After repeated studies, everyone unanimously agreed that after cooperativization, land could be used in a unified manner. High mountains are not suitable for growing crops, so medicinal materials should be planted and Coptis chinensis should be developed; second-tier mountains have water and grass and can be used to build pastures; semi-high mountains have a warm climate and plenty of sunshine, so corn, soybeans, Bashan beans, oats, etc., can be planted and harvested. Several cadres divided the work, on the one hand organizing a large number of laborers to reclaim land and plant grain, and on the other hand drawing people to organize a special team to engage in diversified operations such as planting medicinal materials. In one winter and one spring of land reclamation, the original cultivated area of 930 mu was expanded to more than 1,600 mu. The grain has greatly increased, which has boosted the enthusiasm of the commune members for labor. They all said, "The cadres listen to the Party, and we guarantee to listen to the cadres. We will do whatever we are told to do." The following winter, Dai Fujun and his comrades-in-arms, according to the Party's instructions, led the commune members to build water conservancy projects and transform paddy fields in places where fields could be transformed. In one winter and one spring, 52 mu of fields were transformed. Due to the construction of water conservancy projects and the expansion of cultivated areas, the total grain output has greatly increased. The grain-deficient commune (team) in history has become a surplus-grain commune (team).

	In the process of changing the backward face of Liaoye Lake, various difficulties were constantly encountered, but these difficulties were overcome in time after consulting with the masses. Comrade Dai Fujun said very correctly: "To do a good job, we must listen to the Party and listen to the masses. Whoever deviates from this will not be able to do anything well." In this Party branch, the Party members and ten cadres all made close friends, and Branch Secretary Dai Fujun alone made 19 close friends. Cadres often eat and work with everyone, and discuss things with them when something happens. When vigorously developing diversified operations, Dai Fujun convened a meeting to come up with a way to separate the seeds under the two old Coptis chinensis sheds and the original seedling sheds to solve the seed problem. As a result, without spending a penny, another 75 Coptis chinensis sheds were sprinkled and a Coptis chinensis mountain was opened up.

	In this team, the ten cadres headed by Comrade Dai Fujun have been participating in production and leading production from the time they started working until now. Every cadre has achieved "three togethers" (eat together, labor together, and share weal and woe), and goes wherever they labor. When guarding the wild boar shed, the cadres also shared the work with the commune members and always assigned the commune members to nearby places, and they went to the farthest places themselves. In terms of life, every cadre is no different from the commune members. From the time the canteen was set up to now, no cadre has ever opened a small stove at home.

	Even the accounting books have always adhered to monthly settlements for several years, strictly implemented the "three guarantees" and "six fixings" system, especially after strictly enforcing the reward and punishment system, the commune members said: "The rewards and punishments are clear, and the more we work, the more energetic we become." After the women who accumulated fertilizer were rewarded, they became more active and quickly increased the fertilizer accumulation efficiency by five times.

	The commune members of this team all said that the cadres are their leaders in production, and also their confidants in life, caring and considerate in every way. This is true. Take the canteen as an example. When it was first established, there were no houses and no utensils. Dai Fujun squeezed his family of five into one room and vacated four rooms for use as a kitchen, dining room, etc. Without utensils, he took out his own pots, bowls, spoons, jars, etc. The commune members saw that the branch secretary had taken them out, and they also took the initiative to lend their furniture to the canteen.

	Once, the eighty-year-old childless widower Xia Ji'an fell ill. Dai Fujun rushed over with two liters of rice and brown sugar as soon as he heard about it, and personally decocted medicine, cooked meals, poured tea, and handed water to the old man. The old man was so moved that he said: "Without the Communist Party, who would care if I, a sonless man, got sick? Now the cadres are even closer than my own sons..." After the old man recovered from his illness, he carefully managed the Coptis chinensis and patiently imparted his skills. Once, a storm came, and he was afraid that the wind and rain would damage the Coptis chinensis seedlings, so he ran barefoot to the Coptis chinensis shed. He fell on the road, and the deputy captain Liu Chunyue came to call him back, but he resolutely refused, saying: "In the past, I was beaten and abused and watched the Coptis chinensis for the landlord. Now it is the Coptis chinensis of our own team, how can I not take care of it!"

    辽叶湖上的红旗
    中共湖北竹溪县委第一书记　阎怀智
    辽叶湖拔海二千四百多米，山高气寒，常年云雾，大白天也有野兽来往，加上过去国民党和封建地主阶级的压榨，农民生活更是苦上加苦，有的搬到山外，有的流浪他乡，全村四十六户人家，到解放那年，仅仅剩下十三户人家。
    现在这里发生了天翻地复的变化。1959年，这里的农副业总收入每户平均四百四十四元。收的粮食，留足种籽、饲料以外，每人平均还合一千二百九十二斤。家家存款，户户储粮。新建了民办小学、医院、商店、缝纫店等等，一座小型发电站也正在建立。家家户户喜笑颜开，人们都说：“要不是共产党来领导啊，辽叶湖千年万载也难翻身，为了我们社员，把戴二哥的心都操烂了。”这里说的戴二哥，就是丰溪公社下三坝管理区辽叶生产队的党支部书记兼生产队长戴富钧同志。十年来，以他为首的十个干部，一直是艰苦奋斗，廉洁奉公，按照党的指示，依靠群众，改变了辽叶湖的面貌。
    合作化那年，党提出山区要在粮食够吃有余的基础上，大力发展多种经营，戴富钧一听开了窍，他想：“是啊！有了粮食，人有饭吃，猪有饲料，吃饱了啥事都能干。”便召开干部会研究，又找老农请教，想办法多收粮食。
    经过反复研究，大家一致认为，合作化后土地可以统一使用，大高山不长庄稼种药材，兴黄连；二高山有水有草能办牧场；半高山气候暖和阳光多，种苞谷、黄豆、巴山豆、燕麦等，都可以收。几个干部分了工，一面组织大批劳力开荒种粮食，一面抽人组织专门班子搞多种经营，种药材等。一冬一春开荒，就把原来的耕地面积九百三十亩，一下扩大到一千六百多亩。粮食大大增加了，鼓舞了社员们的劳动积极性，都说：“干部听党的话，我们保证听干部的话，叫干啥就干啥。”第二年冬天，戴富钧和他的战友们，又根据党的指示，领导社员在能改田的地方修水利，改水田，一冬一春，改田五十二亩。由于兴修水利和开荒扩大面积，粮食总产量大大增加。有史以来的缺粮社（队）变成了余粮社（队）。
    在改变辽叶湖落后面貌的过程中，不断地遇到各种困难，但这些困难和群众一商量，都及时克服了。戴富钧同志说得很对：“要作好工作，就要听党的话，听群众的话，谁要离开了这一条，啥事情都办不好。”在这个党支部的党员和十个干部，人人都交了知心朋友，支部书记戴富钧一个人就交了十九个知心朋友。干部经常和大家在一起吃饭、一起干活，有事就和他们商量。在大力发展多种经营的时候，戴富钧就召集大家开会，想出办法，把两个老黄连棚下的种籽，和原来的秧棚分栽，解决种籽问题。结果一个钱没花又撒了七十五个黄连棚，开辟了一座黄连山。
    这个队，以戴富钧同志为首的十个干部，从参加工作到现在，个个都是参加生产，领导生产。每个干部都作到“三同”（同吃、同劳动、同甘共苦），走到哪里劳动到哪里。守野猪棚子的时候，干部也同社员一样分工，并且总是把社员分到近处，自己到最远的地方去。在生活上，每个干部也都和社员没二样，从办起食堂到现在，从来没有一个干部在家开过小灶。
    就是会计账目，几年来，也都一直坚持年清月结，严格执行“三包”、“六定”制度，特别是严格了奖惩制度以后，社员说：“奖惩分得清，越干越有劲。”积肥的妇女们受奖以后，更加积极，很快把积肥工效提高了五倍。
    这个队的社员们都说，干部是他们生产上的领导人，又是生活上的知心人，处处关心、体贴周到。这话可不假。就食堂来说吧，开始办的时候，一没房子，二没用具，戴富钧就把自己一家五口人挤到一间房子里住，腾出四间来做厨房、饭厅等。没有用具，就把自己家里的锅、碗、勺、罐等都拿出来。社员们看支部书记都拿出来了，也都跟着把自己的家具主动借给食堂用。
    有一次，八十多岁的孤老夏吉安病了，戴富钧听说以后马上带着两升大米、红糖赶来，亲自给老人煎药、做饭、端茶、递水。老人被感动得说：“没有共产党，我这没儿子的人病了有谁管？现在干部比儿子还亲……。”这老人病好以后，认真管照黄连，耐心传授技术。一次，狂风暴雨来了，他怕风雨把黄连秧打坏了，就打着赤脚往黄连棚里跑，路上还跌了一跤，副队长刘春月赶来叫他回去，他坚决拒绝说：“过去我挨打受气给地主看黄连，现在是自己队里的黄连还能不管！”
