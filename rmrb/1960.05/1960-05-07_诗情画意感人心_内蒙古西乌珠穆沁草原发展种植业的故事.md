    Poetic and Picturesque Sentiments Touch Hearts
    ——The Story of Developing Agriculture in the Xilin Gol League's West Ujimqin Banner Grassland of Inner Mongolia
    Si Tu

There's a story for every time, a song for every era. Recently, when we went to the Baiyintuga Brigade of the Arxan Baolet commune in the West Ujimqin Banner, we heard such a folk song:

    A bag of fried rice gives strength like the heavens,
    The “Ugula” is sent to the museum,
          (Ugula is a mortar and pestle)
    A potato weighs a pound,
    A watermelon takes two to carry!

At first glance, it's just a common quatrain, but upon closer inspection, it's full of meaning. Having said that, here are a few things to report:

The origin of the song "A bag of fried rice gives strength like the heavens" is as follows: In the Arxan Baolet commune, there was a newlywed woman named Er Urgui. In the early spring of last year, after eating fried rice that she had grown herself and processed with a millstone, she secretly wrapped a handful of fried rice and wrote a letter of victory to her elderly father. The letter of victory said: "I must tell you this good news. Our production team has already eaten fried rice that we grew and processed ourselves. This is the first time I can remember, no, it’s probably the first time even you can remember! Our Arxan Baolet is not far from your Han Aola commune, and I think if we can grow it here, it can grow there too. If you don't believe me, try it and taste the fried rice I sent..." After her father received the bag of fried rice, he sent it to the production team leader and asked to vigorously develop a grain and fodder base. After the production team leader showed the bag of fried rice to the commune members and let them taste it, their confidence increased, and they launched a movement to learn from Arxan Baolet and vigorously develop grain and fodder. As a result, the fodder base developed that year had an unprecedented bumper harvest. This year, the production team's enthusiasm is even greater, and they have expanded it by 10,000 mu at once. Wouldn't you say that "a bag of fried rice gives strength like the heavens"?

The meaning of the phrase "‘Ugula’ sent to the museum" is even greater. Originally, for many years before they planted grain and fodder, the herders here ate fried rice that was transported from Chifeng, Linxi, and other places hundreds of miles away. After the millet was transported, they used "Ugula," pounding it with a mortar and pestle to remove the husk. In this way, one person could not pound out two bowls of fried rice even after pounding for half a day. Now, with the rapid development of the grain and fodder base, even if ten thousand mortars were deployed and ten thousand people pounded, it would not be enough. Therefore, each production team has established stone mills and installed winnowing machines, completely replacing this primitive tool – the “Ugula.” After the “Ugula” completed its historical mission, it has become a toy for children. So they say: "‘Ugula’ sent to the museum!"

"A potato weighs a pound, a watermelon takes two to carry" sings of: During the Great Leap Forward last year, Comrade Mengke, the Party branch secretary of the Baiyintuga Brigade of the Arxan Baolet commune, asked others for some melon seeds and casually scattered them on the edge of the fodder base. Afterward, no one went to take care of them. In July of the lunar calendar, the melons and fodder matured at the same time, each one round and smooth, but no one knew what kind of melon it was. On the day of the harvest, the weather was hot, and the herders were sweating profusely after cutting for a short time and couldn't stand it. At this moment, Comrade Mengke pointed to the melons on the edge of the field and said: "No matter what kind of melons they are, let's try a few to quench our thirst first!" So everyone sat in the melon field, opened one, and my goodness, black seeds and red flesh, sweeter than white sugar. Only then did they know that they were watermelons. When they went home, each person carried one. They weighed the smallest one, and it was a full twelve pounds. And the potatoes they planted last year without fertilizer, the largest weighed a pound, and the smallest weighed four ounces. So they said: "A potato weighs a pound, a watermelon takes two to carry!"

The origins of the folk songs have been briefly introduced. From these points, it is not difficult to see that the West Ujimqin grassland has forever ended the history of "only hearing the calls of cattle and sheep, and not producing a single grain." Now, not only do grains grow here, but also melons, fruits, and vegetables are abundant!

    诗情画意感人心
    ——内蒙古西乌珠穆沁草原发展种植业的故事
    斯图
    什么时候就有什么时候的故事，什么时代就有什么时代的歌谣。最近我们到西乌珠穆沁旗阿尔山宝力格公社白音吐嘎大队，就听到这么一首歌谣：
    一包炒米力大如天，
    “乌古拉”送进博物馆，
          （乌古拉是杵臼）
    一个土豆一斤重，
    一个西瓜两人搬！
    咋听起来，是一般的四句诗，可细一打听，里头大有文章。前言说到这里，下面报道这样几件事：
    “一包炒米力大如天”这句歌谣的来历是这样的：阿尔山宝力格公社，有一位新婚妇女叫额日乌桂，她在去年初春吃到了自己种的、自己用碾子加工的炒米以后，悄悄的包了一把炒米，写了一封报捷信，给她年迈的爹爹捎去了。报捷信上说：“我不得不告诉你们这个好消息。我们生产队已经吃到了自己种的自己加工的炒米。这是我记事以来，不，也是老爹爹你记事以来的第一次吧！我们的阿尔山宝力格和你们汗敖拉公社相距不远，我想，我们这里能种，你们那里就能长。不信你们试试看，再尝尝我捎去的炒米……”她爹爹接到这包炒米以后，就给生产队长送去，要求大搞粮食饲料基地。生产队长把这包炒米，给社员们看看、尝尝以后，增加了信心，掀起了学阿尔山宝力格的大搞粮食饲料运动。结果当年开辟的饲料基地，得到空前丰收。今年这个生产队的劲头更大，一下子扩大了一万亩。你说这不是“一包炒米力大如天”吗？
    “‘乌古拉’送进博物馆”这句话意义更大了。原来这里的牧民，在未种粮食饲料以前的多少年来，人吃的炒米都是从千里以外的赤峰、林西等地运来。谷子运来以后，就用“乌古拉”一杵一杵地砸着去皮。这样一个人杵上半天也杵不出两碗炒米。现在随着粮食饲料基地的迅速开展，就是万臼上阵万人砸，也杵不过来了。因此各生产队都建立了石碾石磨，安装了扇车，全部代替了这个原始工具——“乌古拉”。“乌古拉”完成了它的历史任务以后，已成了小孩的玩物。所以他们说：“‘乌古拉’送进博物馆！”
    “一个土豆一斤重，一个西瓜两人搬”歌唱的是：在去年大跃进中，阿尔山宝力格公社白音吐嘎大队党支书孟克同志，向别人要了些瓜籽，来家随便撒在饲料基地的地头上，以后再也没人去管。旧历7月，瓜和饲料同时成熟了，一个个圆溜溜的，但谁也不知道是什么瓜。在开镰收饲料的那天，天气炎热，牧民割了不大工夫，就汗流满面，架不住劲了。这工夫孟克同志指着地头的瓜说：“不管是什么瓜，咱们先尝几个，解解渴再说！”于是大家坐在瓜地里打开一吃，好家伙，黑子红瓤，比白糖还甜，这才知道，原来是大西瓜。他们回家的时候，每人抱了一个，挑最小的秤了一下，整整是十二斤。还有他们去年没上粪种的土豆，最大的有一斤，最小的也有四两。所以他们说：“一个土豆一斤重，一个西瓜两人搬！”
    歌谣的来历，简介完毕。就从这几点，不难看出，西乌珠穆沁草原永远结束了“只听牛羊叫，不产一粒粮”的历史。这里现在不但生长五谷，而且盛产瓜果蔬菜！
