　　Catching up.
　　By our reporters Sun Yuedong and Wang Huandou

　　"Catching up"—for the vast number of peasants in Sichuan Province today, this is no ordinary word. It is a universal demand and a unified pace of seventy million people. Since the red flags of Lezhi and Wusheng counties were raised, a wave of one horse taking the lead and ten thousand horses galloping has quickly swept across Sichuan.

　　Lezhi and Wusheng were originally poor places with barren land. However, after two consecutive years of the Great Leap Forward, they have changed their backward appearance and become grain-producing counties exceeding the "Program" with a yield of one thousand catties per mu. Here, there is plenty of manure and water, the cattle are strong, and the pigs are fat. Even the rocky land of the past grows first-class seedlings. This good example of backwardness turning into advancement has further stimulated the strong enterprising spirit of the masses. Cadres and commune members in various places are seriously asking themselves: why can others do it, but we can't? Recently, we traveled to Jianyang, Suining, Anyue, Ziyang, and other counties, all of which are neighbors of Lezhi. Through this corner, we saw a moving scene of competition in agricultural production.

　　Fervent Emulation Competition
　　Upon arriving in Suining County, which is adjacent to Lezhi County, one can quickly feel a strong atmosphere of striving for advancement. The market towns and intersections we passed were all covered with large banners reading "Learn from Lezhi, Catch up with Lezhi." The edges of fields and plots were piled with fertilizer everywhere. The formerly low-yielding barren land is now planted with wooden signs that read "Surpass Lezhi High-Yield Field." It turned out that the cadres and commune members here, taking Lezhi and Wusheng as examples, have in recent months formed more than 800 soil improvement teams to cover 210,000 mu of red slopes and bald ridges with a layer of fertile soil, laying the foundation for high-yield fields. Subsequently, the county established more than 3,000 "Catch Lezhi Red Flag Mountain, Red Flag Bay, Red Flag Dam" projects. Each "Catch Lezhi High-Yield Field" has quite high standards. There is a wheat field on the 16th High-Yield Road in the county, and the managers had long strived to make this place a "Surpass Lezhi High-Yield Field," but it was only officially named by the masses not long ago. Because at that time, the seedlings did not emerge evenly. After replanting the missing spots, the topdressing fertilizer was not followed up. After the topdressing fertilizer was applied, the soil was cultivated a step late. Later, seeing that it was about to catch up with Lezhi's high-yield fields, it was discovered that the wheat seedlings in a few plots were partly green and partly yellow, with different colors. This time, the managers made up their minds and launched a "wash the face" campaign to address the inconsistent color of the wheat seedlings until everyone agreed that this wheat field could rival Lezhi's high-yield fields, then it was named "Catch Lezhi High-Yield Field."

　　Catching up with the Art of Leadership
　　The work style of commanders at all levels that we saw along the way often reminded us of the energy we had seen in Lezhi and Wusheng. This energy is known as "Douying."

　　"Douying" is a Sichuan dialect. Lezhi and Wusheng put it forward in response to a superficial and unrealistic unhealthy tendency, and it has become louder and louder in practical work. Generally speaking, "Douying" means being solid, uncompromising, meticulous, unwavering, and doing what you say. In practical work, it is a real leadership art.

　　Tens of thousands of cadres went to Lezhi and Wusheng counties. What they saw was the outstanding achievements that they had not expected in the past, and they did not find any unheard-of shortcuts. After looking around, people found that the common outstanding feature of the two counties was "Douying." Lezhi and Wusheng unswervingly implemented the Party's policies and firmly established the political and ideological foundation of "the same way"; the two red flag counties meticulously grasped the work of improving soil, building water conservancy, raising pigs and accumulating fertilizer, selecting good seeds, and improving tools, and firmly established the material foundation of "the same way."

　　Although no one has stipulated the specific content of "Douying" or delineated a scope, the leading cadres at all levels we have seen in the places we have passed have the same understanding, the same feelings, and the same love for "Douying." After visiting Lezhi and Wusheng, the first secretaries of many counties, districts, and communes took off their shoes and went down to the fields halfway, discussing and studying with the masses while personally setting an example in the fields; then, they held on-site meetings to resolutely implement it. In this way, superiors influence subordinates, and levels lead by example. Everyone is "Douying" in everything, and there are no more problems such as insufficient quality and unqualified specifications.

　　In learning the leadership art of Lezhi and Wusheng, while delegating cadres to strengthen grassroots leadership, various places have also selected a large number of new forces with advanced thinking, firm positions, full of energy, and in-depth work styles to establish a strong leading core.

　　Catching Up Means Continuous Progress

　　People who are catching up with the advanced are desperately chasing, and the advanced themselves are constantly improving. Whoever ignores this fact will not be able to catch up with the advanced. Cadres of the Annong Commune in Anyue County told us that this commune took a detour in the movement to catch up with Lezhi.

　　Annong Commune and Xianhe Management District of Red Flag Commune in Lezhi County are old rivals in competition. The natural conditions of both sides are similar, and they are both famous communes in the county, which can be described as evenly matched. Before the autumn sowing last year, the two sides launched a high-yield wheat competition. Annong Commune was able to catch up with Lezhi in terms of deep plowing, base fertilizer, dense planting, and good seeds for wheat, and the sowing time was earlier than theirs. As soon as the wheat seedlings emerged from the soil, Annong Commune sent cadres to visit. At that time, the wheat in Lezhi was indeed growing very well, and the wheat seedlings in Annong Commune were not bad either. Because they were sown earlier, some places even surpassed Lezhi. The cadres who went to Lezhi to visit returned and said to everyone: "We have caught up with Lezhi!" From then on, everyone relaxed. However, Lezhi County has further improved its wheat management work compared to last year. Specialized teams have been established universally, with responsibilities assigned to the fields and management assigned to each plant. The work is as delicate as embroidery. Many people who visited Lezhi praised it incessantly. However, some people in Annong Commune said after listening to it: "We have caught up with them." When the wheat was jointing, the commune sent people to Lezhi to visit again. When they walked into the territory of Lezhi, they saw that the plant structure was better than that of their own commune. At first, they thought it was only the case in one or two communes or one or two wheat fields. Later, they walked more than 100 miles along the road, and the wheat on the slopes was the same specification, the same plant structure, and the same color, all first-class seedlings. They were greatly surprised. After the visiting cadres returned, they held a telephone conference overnight. They said to everyone: "If we don't look and compare, we won't know that we have fallen behind!" At the meeting, they criticized the slack and complacent mood and conveyed Lezhi's wheat field management experience. The next day, the entire commune reclassified and lined up according to the high standards of wheat seedlings, rectified the specialized teams, tightened the management system, and applied large amounts of water and fertilizer and carried out large-scale pest control for different seedlings. A commune cadre, pointing to the wheat that was about to mature, said to us: "This has played a huge role in the wheat's grain filling. It is estimated that our wheat yield this year will be double that of last year. Of course, because we took a detour, we were not able to catch up with Lezhi!"

    赶
    本报记者　孙跃冬　王焕斗
    赶，今天对于四川省广大农民说来，不是一个平平常常的字眼儿，而是七千万人的普遍的要求，一致的步调。自从乐至县和武胜县这两面红旗树立起来之后，一马当先，万马奔腾的浪潮迅即席卷全川。
    乐至和武胜原是田瘦土薄的穷地方。但是，经过连续两年的大跃进，他们改变了落后的面貌，成为跨“纲要”的粮食千斤县。在这里，粪多水足，牛壮猪肥，连过去的石骨地也长出一类苗。这种落后变先进的好样子，进一步激发了广大群众强烈的进取精神。各地干部和社员都这样严肃地反问自己：为什么人家能够做到的，我们就不能做到？最近，我们到简阳、遂宁、安岳、资阳等县走了一趟，这些县都是乐至的近邻。通过这一角，我们看到了农业生产战线上你追我赶的动人景象。
    火热的边际竞赛
    到了跟乐至县毗邻的遂宁县境内，使人很快就感觉到一种力争上游的强烈气氛。我们经过的场镇、路口，全都写上“学乐至、赶乐至”的大幅标语。田坎、地边，到处堆积着肥料。过去产量很低的瘦地，如今都插上木牌，写了“超乐至丰产田”。原来，这里的干部和社员曾以乐至和武胜为榜样，在最近几个月中，组成八百多个改良土壤队，给二十一万亩红坡秃岭地面上了一层肥泥，打下了丰产田的基础。随后，全县建立“赶乐至红旗山、红旗湾、红旗坝”三千多个，每一块“赶乐至丰产田”，都有着相当高的标准。该县第十六丰产路上有一片麦地，管理员们早就争取将这里作为“超乐至丰产田”，但在不久以前才由群众正式命名。因为，当时的幼苗出得不齐，补了窝之后追肥没有跟上，追肥施足后，培土又迟了一步；后来，眼看快要赶上乐至的丰产田了，又发现少数田块的麦苗有青有黄，颜色不一样。这次，管理员们下了狠心，针对麦苗颜色不一致的情况，展开了“洗花脸”运动，直到大家都肯定了这片麦田能和乐至丰产田媲美时，才名命“赶乐至丰产田”。
    赶领导艺术
    我们一路上看到的各级指挥员的工作作风，常常使我们想起在乐至和武胜所看到过的那股劲头。这股劲头，被人们称为“逗硬”。
    逗硬，是一句四川土语。乐至和武胜针对着一种虚浮不实的不良倾向，将它提了出来，而且在实际工作中越喊越响亮。一般说来，逗硬是扎扎实实、不折不扣、一丝不苟、坚定不移、说到做到的意思。而在实际工作中，它却是一种具有实实在在内容的领导艺术。
    成千上万的干部到了乐至和武胜两县，众目所见的是过去没有想到的突出的成绩，并没有发现闻所未闻的捷径。人们看来看去，发现了两个县共同的突出的特点就是“逗硬”。乐至和武胜坚定不移地贯彻党的方针政策，切实扎下了“一个样”的政治思想基础；两个红旗县都是不折不扣地抓好改良土壤、兴修水利、养猪积肥、选用良种、改良工具等工作，扎下了“一个样”的物质基础。
    虽然谁也没有为逗硬规定具体内容，划出一个范围，但我们走过的地方，见到的各级领导干部，却对逗硬具有同样的理解、同样的感受，也有同样的喜爱。许多县、区、公社的第一书记，从乐至、武胜参观回来以后，半路上就脱鞋下田，一边跟群众商量研究，一边亲自动手在田里作出样子；然后，召开现场会议，坚决贯彻。这样上行下效，层层带头，人人逗硬，事事逗硬，再也不存在质量不够、规格不合等问题了。
    在学习乐至、武胜的领导艺术中，各地在下放干部充实基层领导的同时，还选拔了大批思想先进、立场坚定、干劲十足、作风深入的新生力量，树立起坚强领导核心。
    赶，就是不断前进
    赶先进的人们在拼命追赶，而先进者本身也在不断提高。谁忽视了这一事实，谁就无法赶上先进。安岳县安农公社的干部告诉我们，这个公社在赶乐至运动中走过一段弯路。
    安农公社和乐至县红旗公社仙鹤管区，是竞赛的老对手。双方自然条件差不多，又都是县内的著名公社，可谓旗鼓相当。去年秋播前，双方开展了小麦高产竞赛。安农公社在小麦的深耕、底肥、密植、良种等方面都能赶上了乐至，而且播种时间还比他们早些。麦苗一出土，安农公社就派了干部前往参观。当时，乐至的小麦生长的确很好，而安农公社的麦苗也不差，因为播得早，有些地方还胜过了乐至。去乐至参观的干部回来对大家说：“赶上乐至了！”从此大家松了劲。但乐至县的小麦管理工作却比去年又提高了一步，普遍建立了专业队，责任到田，管理到株，细致如绣花，许多人到乐至参观回来都赞口不绝。但安农公社有的人听了却说：“我们赶上了他们。”麦子拔节时，公社又派人前往乐至参观。他们走到乐至境内一看，苗架长得比自己公社的好，最初还以为只不过一、两个公社或一、两片麦田如此，后来沿路走了一百余里，坡上坡下的麦子是一样规格、一样苗架、一样颜色，全是一类苗，这才大吃一惊。参观的干部回来以后，就连夜召开电话会议，他们对大家说：“不看不比，还不知我们落了后！”会上批判了松劲自满情绪，传达了乐至的麦田管理经验。第二天，全社按照小麦苗架高标准重新分类排队，整顿了专业队，严密了管理制度，针对不同苗架增施了大水大肥和进行大治虫。公社干部指着即将成熟的麦子对我们说：“这样一来，对小麦孕穗起了极大作用，据估计，我们今年小麦能比去年增产一倍。当然，因为走了弯路，我们没有能赶上乐至！”
