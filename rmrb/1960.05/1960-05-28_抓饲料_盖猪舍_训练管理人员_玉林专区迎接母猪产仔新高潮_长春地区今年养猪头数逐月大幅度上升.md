　　Yulin Prefecture Welcomes a New Peak in Sow Farrowing
　　Changchun Area Sees a Significant Monthly Increase in the Number of Pigs Raised This Year
　　This newspaper reports that Yulin Prefecture in Guangxi is taking measures to welcome the upcoming new peak in sow farrowing. During the spring mating and pregnancy campaign, 98% of the adult sows in Yulin Prefecture conceived. Currently, over 58,000 sows have already farrowed, and over 170,000 pregnant sows are expected to farrow successively in the late second quarter or early third quarter. Calculating an average of nine piglets per litter, it is estimated that the number of pigs in the entire prefecture will increase by over 1.53 million in the next two to three months.

　　Grasping fodder production is the material foundation for large-scale pig raising. Currently, a fodder production campaign centered on "aquatic high-yield fodder as the key, combining aquatic and terrestrial production" is underway throughout the prefecture. Ponds, rivers, and ditches in various parts of the prefecture are covered with lush green water hyacinths, water lettuce, and fleshy herbs; hillsides, roadsides, and fodder fields are filled with cassava, pigeon peas, corn, and red vine potatoes. In particular, high-yield fodders such as water hyacinth and fleshy herbs require little land, yield high outputs, are easy to manage, are nutritious, and are favored by pigs. Currently, the entire prefecture has planted over 587,000 mu of green fodder, averaging 2.8 fen of fodder land per pig; over 470,000 mu of concentrated feed have been planted, averaging 2.3 fen of land per pig. In order to ensure that sows have sufficient milk after farrowing, various regions are vigorously strengthening the care of early-maturing fodder and miscellaneous grain crops, and it is estimated that 39 million jin of concentrated feed can be harvested in the first half of the year.

　　In order to welcome the arrival of piglets, Yulin Prefecture is training technical personnel. The prefecture has organized livestock and epidemic prevention inspection and guidance teams to go to various counties to guide training. With the help of the guidance teams, various counties have universally established various training classes, requiring personnel to be multi-skilled: capable of feeding, planting, delivering piglets, preventing epidemics, and mating. More than 2,800 feeders in Pingnan County have generally received training, and they generally implement a prevention system of "daily cleaning, minor disinfection every three days, major disinfection every seven days, isolation of sick animals, and prevention first before disease" in terms of disease treatment and epidemic prevention.

　　With the large-scale development of pig raising, pigsties must be increased accordingly. Calculating an average of six pigs per pen, more than 250,000 pig pens will need to be added after a large number of sows farrow. According to recent statistics, the entire prefecture has expanded and built more than 260,000 pig pens, and the pigsty problem required for the large-scale development of pig raising has been solved.

　　This newspaper reports that since the beginning of the year, the number of pigs raised in the Changchun area of Jilin has increased significantly month by month and ten-day period by ten-day period. According to recent statistics, the number of pigs raised in the entire area has reached more than 1,297,000, and after deducting those sold to the state and those consumed by commune members, the number of pigs in stock is more than 1,006,000, an increase of 39.8% compared to the end of last year. In the entire area, nineteen communes, four hundred and thirty-six management districts, and more than four thousand two hundred production teams have doubled the number of pigs raised.

　　The fundamental reason for the high-speed development of pig raising in the Changchun area is the participation of the entire Party, the mobilization of the entire people, and the large-scale specialized raising of pigs. At all levels in the Changchun area, Party committees are led by their secretaries, and livestock production leadership organizations have been established at each level. Leading cadres at all levels have gone deep into pig farms to plant experimental fields, grasp planning, grasp measures, promptly summarize and promote advanced experiences, conduct meticulous ideological mobilization and organizational work; and widely carry out the pig raising red flag competition of learning from, comparing with, catching up with, and helping each other between counties, communes, management districts, and production teams, which has powerfully promoted the large-scale development of pig raising in the entire area.

　　The large-scale establishment of collective breeding farms and pig farms by the people's communes is also an important reason for the large-scale development of pig raising. Various regions have conscientiously implemented the policy of "collective raising as the main focus, private raising as a supplement," and have adopted the method of setting up farms at four levels (county, commune, district, team) and advancing on four fronts (state-owned, collective, units, canteens) to establish collective breeding farms and pig farms on a large scale. Currently, there are more than 12,000 farms in the entire area, and the proportion of collectively raised pigs has increased sharply from 50% at the end of last year to 82%.

　　Various regions have resolutely implemented the principle of self-breeding and self-raising, and have adopted measures such as keeping all sows seen, selecting after keeping, and breeding more with less feed. Starting from the fourth quarter of last year, they have focused on ensuring the safe wintering and feeding management of pigs, breaking the routine of not mating in winter, organizing a winter mating blitz, and vigorously storing feed, creating favorable conditions for large-scale development this year. Since the beginning of the year, the communes have actively launched the "Five Fulls" and "One Sow, One Hundred Grandchildren" high-yield movement, further promoting full mating and pregnancy of sows, and improving the survival rate of piglets. Basically, all sows capable of breeding in the entire area have achieved full mating and pregnancy, and the average sow farrowing rate has increased by about 10% compared to the fourth quarter of last year, and the survival rate of piglets has increased from 87% at the end of last year to 94.5%. The number of sows in the entire area has developed to more than 350,000, an increase of 50% compared to the number in stock at the end of last year, laying the foundation for the large-scale development of pig raising throughout the year. In addition, various regions have strengthened feeding management and established epidemic prevention organizations at all levels. (Attached pictures)

    抓饲料　盖猪舍　训练管理人员
    玉林专区迎接母猪产仔新高潮
    长春地区今年养猪头数逐月大幅度上升
    本报讯　广西玉林专区各地采取措施，迎接即将到来的母猪产仔新高潮。在春配满怀运动中，玉林专区98％的成年母猪都受孕怀胎。现在，已有五万八千多头母猪产仔；还有十七万多头怀孕母猪，也将在第二季末或第三季初陆续产仔。按每窝平均产仔猪九头计算，在未来两三月内，估计全专区生猪将增加一百五十三万多头。
    抓好饲料生产是养猪大发展的物质基础。目前，全专区开展了一个“以水生高产饲料为纲，水陆并举”的饲料生产运动。专区各地水塘、河道、沟渠，都铺满了翠绿的水葫芦、水浮莲、肉草；山坡、路旁、饲料地里，都长满了木茹、木豆、玉米、红茹藤。特别是水葫芦、肉草等高产饲料，占地少，产量高，管理简便，营养好，猪很喜爱吃。目前全专区共种有青饲料五十八万七千多亩，平均每头猪有饲料地二分八厘；共种有精饲料四十七万多亩，平均每头猪有二分三厘地。为了使母猪产仔后有足够的乳汁，各地正大力加强对早熟饲料和杂粮作物的护理，预计上半年可以收获精饲料三千九百万斤。
    为了迎接小猪降生，玉林专区正在培训技术人员，专区组织了畜牧防疫卫生检查辅导组，分赴各县指导训练。在辅导组帮助下，各县普遍开办了各种训练班，要求一员多能：能饲养、能种植、能接生、能防疫、能配种。平南县的二千八百多名饲养员，普遍受到训练，他们在治病防疫方面，普遍实行“天天打扫，三天小消毒，七天大消毒，有病隔离，无病先防”的预防制度。
    生猪大发展以后，猪舍必须相应的增加。以每栏平均存放六头猪计算，母猪大量产仔后，共需增加猪栏二十五万多个。据最近统计，全专区已扩建修建猪舍二十六万多栏，生猪大发展所需的猪舍问题已经解决了。
    本报讯　吉林长春地区年初以来，养猪头数逐月逐旬大幅度上升。据最近统计，全区养猪头数达一百二十九万七千多头，除了卖给国家和社员自食以外，存栏数为一百万零六千多头，比去年年底存栏数增长了39.8％，全区有十九个公社、四百三十六个管理区、四千二百多个生产队养猪数翻了一番。
    全党动手、全民动员、大养特养其猪，是长春地区养猪事业高速度发展的根本原因。长春地区各级党委都由书记挂帅，逐级建立了畜牧业生产领导机构，各级领导干部纷纷深入养猪场种试验田，抓规划、抓措施，及时总结和推广先进经验，细致进行思想发动和组织工作；并且广泛开展了县与县、社与社、管理区与管理区、生产队与生产队之间的学、比、赶、帮的养猪红旗竞赛，有力地推动了全区养猪事业的大发展。
    人民公社大办集体繁殖场、饲养场，也是养猪大发展的重要原因。各地认真贯彻执行了“公养为主、私养为辅”的政策，采取四级（县、社、区、队）办场，四路（国营、集体、单位、食堂）进军的办法大办集体饲养场、繁殖场。目前全区共办场一万二千多处，集体养猪比重由去年年末的50％猛增到82％。
    各地坚决贯彻了自繁自养的原则，采取见母就留、先留后选、少吃多繁殖的措施。从去年第四季度开始，就狠抓猪的安全过冬和饲养管理，打破冬季不配种的常规，组织冬季配种大突击和大力贮备饲料等一系列工作，为今年大发展创造了有利条件。年初以来，各公社又积极开展了“五全”、“一母百仔孙”高产运动，进一步促进了母猪全配、满怀，提高了仔猪的成活率。全地区能繁殖的母猪基本上做到了全配、满怀，母猪产仔率平均比去年第四季度提高了10％左右，仔猪成活率由去年年底的87％，提高到94.5％。全区母猪发展到三十五万多头，比去年年末存栏数增长了50％，为养猪全年大发展打下了基础。此外，各地还加强了饲养管理，层层建立了防疫组织。（附图片）
