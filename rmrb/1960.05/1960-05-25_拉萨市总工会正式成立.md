At present, sixteen enterprises and institutions in Lhasa City have established trade union organizations, and some enterprises and institutions are preparing to establish trade union organizations. The workers have carried out technical innovation and technical revolution in the patriotic production increase movement, and a large number of advanced collectives and advanced producers have emerged. More than 80% of Tibetan handicraft workers in the city have also participated in various handicraft production mutual aid groups. Due to organized production and a vigorous technical innovation movement, the technical level of handicraft production has greatly improved.

    The assembly also adopted the "Letter to All Workers in Lhasa City," calling on all workers in Lhasa City to hold high the banner of the General Line and the Great Leap Forward, exert full effort, thoroughly complete the democratic revolution, and vigorously carry out the patriotic production increase movement.

    拉萨市总工会正式成立
    新华社拉萨24日电　拉萨市总工会第一次代表大会最近闭幕，选举成立了拉萨市总工会。
    这次大会总结了过去一年来拉萨市工会组织在党的领导下取得的成绩和经验，确定了今后的工作任务。
    在过去一年来的民主改革运动中，拉萨市的工人运动有了蓬勃发展。职工群众在摧毁了封建行会把头制度以后，建立了自己的组织—拉萨市总工会筹备委员会。目前拉萨市已有十六个企业和事业单位建立了工会组织，还有些企业和事业单位正在筹备建立工会组织。职工们在爱国增产运动中大搞技术革新和技术革命，涌现出大批先进集体和先进生产者。全市藏族手工业工人也已有80％以上参加了各种手工业生产互助组，由于组织起来进行生产和大搞技术革新运动，手工业生产的技术水平有了很大提高。
    这次大会还通过了“告全市职工书”，号召全拉萨市职工群众高举总路线、大跃进的旗帜，鼓足干劲，彻底完成民主革命和大搞爱国增产运动。
