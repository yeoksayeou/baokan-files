	Central Government Allocates Machinery to Support Henan's Summer Harvest and Planting
	This year, Henan's summer harvest crops are growing well, and the harvest area is large. To support the province's summer harvest and planting, the central government recently allocated 232 standard units of tractors and 120 combine harvesters to Henan Province. These tractors and combine harvesters have been transported to various locations and put into the intense summer harvest work, which will play a positive role in the successful completion of the summer harvest and planting tasks.
	
	Ningxia Vigorously Promotes New Tools
	From mid-April to now, the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has organized multiple on-site demonstrations and roving performances in various counties and cities to promote the use of new tools.
	Adapting to the specific conditions of the Ningxia area, the autonomous region has focused on reforming rural transportation tools, feed processing tools, and grain and oil processing tools. In terms of transportation tools, small rubber-wheeled carts, flower-wheeled carts, and large rubber-wheeled carts are currently being vigorously promoted. Communes in the Yellow River Plain are also building wooden boats, preparing to develop shipping using the canals. In terms of feed processing tools, the region has produced more than 300 feed crushers, and has also trial-produced small animal-powered crushing tools based on the principle of "combining indigenous and foreign methods." Various localities are also actively developing water mills and water grinders, and reforming grain and oil processing tools.
	
	Learning from and Catching Up with Innovation Pace-setter Jiang Zhaozhi Across Tianshan
	Jiang Zhaozhi of the Zhengfan Household Production Brigade of the Hongqi People's Commune in Hutubi County, Xinjiang, has achieved great results in reforming complete sets of agricultural tools. Over the past few years, he has created, imitated, and modified 25 types of production machinery, totaling more than 100 pieces, for plowing, land preparation, sowing, cultivating, harvesting, and threshing. The cotton strip seeding machine he modified from a wheat row seeder increased work efficiency by more than 50 times. The wheat threshing machine he created can save the entire team 18 laborers and 14 draft horses every day.
	Currently, a movement to learn from Jiang Zhaozhi is underway in the vast rural areas across Tianshan, in order to launch a high tide of agricultural technology innovation through this movement.
	
	Shaanxi Reclaims Wasteland and Builds Five New Large-Scale State-Owned Farms
	The five new large-scale state-owned farms in Shaanxi Province have reclaimed more than 168,000 mu of wasteland by the beginning of May. More than 120,000 mu of this land has already been sown with grain, oil crops, and other crops.
	In order to ensure faster agricultural production increases, Shaanxi Province is reclaiming wasteland in the sandy areas of Yulin and Jingbian counties in northern Shaanxi, where water conservancy conditions are relatively good and the soil has been initially improved, and in the wasteland of Dali County, which has been tested and surveyed, to establish five state-owned farms. The reclamation of these barren sandy lands began last winter, and is currently being carried out while planting.
	
	Anhui Province Selects Good Seeds Universally in Conjunction with Summer Harvest
	A massive mass summer crop seed selection movement has formed in various parts of Anhui Province. Party committees at all levels and relevant departments attach great importance to this year's summer seed selection work, and have convened special meetings at all levels. After determining the seed fields, various localities immediately carried out weeding and inferior removal work in the fields. The Liudong People's Commune in Liu'an, which has continuously created large-area, sustained high yields of wheat, has carried out weeding and inferior removal and removal of diseased plants in its 13,000 mu disease-free good seed propagation area. The "Dwarf Grain More" wheat good seed base of 3,770 mu in the Fantongqiao People's Commune in Liu'an County has been weeded and had inferior plants removed two to three times.
	
	Hetao Plain Intensifies Spring Wheat Management
	Members of the people's communes on the Hetao Plain in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are working day and night to carry out intensive irrigation, hoeing, and increased fertilizer application in the fields with crisscrossing canals, strengthening the field management of spring wheat. Now, one million mu of spring wheat is lush green and the seedlings are growing vigorously.
	The Hetao Plain is Inner Mongolia's famous "granary," with a high grain yield in the past. This year, the major canals in the Hetao Irrigation Area generally released water for irrigating green crops half a month to 20 days earlier than last year. According to statistics on May 22, the entire irrigation area has irrigated more than 477,000 mu of spring wheat, 29,000 mu of rice, and more than 570,000 mu of reclaimed land, forest land, and pastures.

    中央拨机械支援河南夏收夏种
    今年，河南夏收作物生长良好，收割面积很大，为了支援这个省夏收夏种，中央最近拨给河南省拖拉机二百三十二个标准台，康拜因收割机一百二十台。这批拖拉机和康拜因收割机已分别运往各地，投入了紧张的夏收工作，这对胜利完成夏收夏种任务将起到积极的作用。
          宁夏大力推广新工具
    宁夏回族自治区从4月中旬到现在，各县、市组织了多次现场观摩和巡回表演，促进新工具的推广。
    适应宁夏地区的具体情况，自治区把农村运输工具、饲料加工和粮油加工工具作为改革重点。在运输工具方面，目前各地正在大力推广小胶轮车、花轮车和大胶轮车。黄河平原各公社还在制造木船，准备利用渠道发展航运。在饲料加工工具方面，全区已生产了三百多部饲料粉碎机，并且本着“土洋并举”的原则，试制成了小型畜力粉碎工具。各地还积极发展水磨、水碾，改革粮油加工工具。
      天山南北学赶革新标兵蒋兆枝
    新疆呼图壁县红旗人民公社正繁户生产大队蒋兆枝，成套改革农具获得很大成绩。几年来他创造、仿制、改装了犁地、整地、播种、中耕、收割、脱粒等生产机具二十五种共一百多件。他用小麦拾行播种机改装的棉花条播机提高工效五十倍以上，创制的小麦脱粒机每天可以使全队节省十八个劳动力和十四匹耕马。
