    Baby Rabbits Hatching Chicks
    Sun Shaoyuan, a member of the Qingtaizhuang Production Team of the Shangye People's Commune in Fei County, Shandong Province, used three litters of baby rabbits in rotation last May to hatch four chicks in two attempts. Two of these hens have now begun to lay eggs.
    The method of using baby rabbits to hatch chicks is as follows: Place half a cylinder of wheat stalks in a small jar or small granary. Dig a small nest in the middle and pad it with old cotton wadding. Place the hatching eggs in the middle, then place the three- to five-day-old baby rabbits on top of the hatching eggs and cover them with a small amount of rabbit fur. This way, the body temperature of the baby rabbits can be used to hatch the chicks. During incubation, the baby rabbits' ability to move gradually increases. After fifteen days, they often run away. Therefore, two litters of baby rabbits should be used to replace each other in hatching.
    During incubation, the baby rabbits should be fed milk at regular intervals. And use this time to make slight movements of the hatching eggs.

    仔兔抱小鸡
    山东省费县上冶人民公社青太庄生产队社员孙绍元，在去年五月间，用三窝仔兔轮换接替，两次孵出小鸡四只，现在已有两只母鸡开始产蛋。
    利用仔兔孵鸡的办法是：在一口小缸或小囤子里面放上半缸麦穰，在中间挖个小窝，垫上旧棉絮，把种蛋放在中间，再把出生后三、五天的小兔放在种蛋上面，盖上少量的兔毛，这样就可以利用仔兔的体温孵鸡。在孵抱中，仔兔活动能力逐渐增加。十五天后往往跑出去。因此要用两窝仔兔接替孵抱。
    在孵化时，应按一定时间给仔兔吃奶。并利用这个时间，把种蛋作轻微的翻动。
