    Make Full Use of Every Bit of Resources
    Recently, taking advantage of my work, I went to many coal and iron mines in Anxi, Yongchun, Datian and other counties in Fujian. Wherever I went, I could see that the workers were working hard, contributing to the early completion and overfulfillment of the coal and iron production plan. However, in individual factories, I also saw some areas where the work was not done well enough. I would like to bring them up for these factories to refer to. When some steel plants go to iron mines to purchase ore, they only pay attention to ore with an iron content of more than 60%, and do not make enough use of those lean ores. There are also individual places where limestone is used to pave roads or pad large driveways because of tight work tasks. Although this is an individual phenomenon, it should also be taken seriously. Iron ore is a valuable national treasure and an important resource for developing production. Even a little bit should be fully utilized to serve socialist construction.
    In addition, there is a lot of iron slag and ore powder left over from steel plant production, although some of it has been utilized, it has not been utilized enough. It is also hoped that these steel plants will make full use of these iron slag and ore powder. Steel plants with the conditions can set up cement plants to use iron slag to manufacture cement, on the one hand to support national construction, on the other hand to arm themselves.

### 充分利用点滴资源

    充分利用点滴资源
    最近，我乘工作之便，先后到福建安溪、永春、大田等县的许多煤铁矿厂走了一趟、不管走到哪里，到处都可以看到工人们干劲冲天，都在为提前超额完成煤铁生产计划贡献自己的力量。但是，在个别厂，也看到了一些工作做得不够的地方。我想提出来供这些厂参考。有些钢铁厂到铁矿选购矿石时，只注意含铁量占百分之六十以上的矿石，对那些贫矿则利用得不够。还有个别地方因为工作任务紧，用石灰石铺了公路或垫了大车道。虽然这是个别的现象，也应该引起重视。铁矿石是国家的宝贵财富，是发展生产的重要资源，那怕是一点一滴，也要把它充分利用起来，为社会主义建设服务。
    此外，目前钢铁厂生产剩下来的铁渣和矿粉很多虽然也利用了一些，但是利用得还不够。也希望这些钢铁厂把这些铁渣和矿粉都充分利用起来。有条件的钢铁厂，可以附设水泥厂，利用铁渣制造水泥，一方面支援国家建设，一方面武装自己。
