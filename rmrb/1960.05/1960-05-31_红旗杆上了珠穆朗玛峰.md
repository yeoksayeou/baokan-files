The silvery-grey mountain peaks are hidden in thick layers of fog, and the steep rocks are covered with a boundless expanse of white snow; streaks of light-blue primeval glaciers "cascade" down from the towering cliffs like waterfalls; the deep valleys twist and turn, as if their end can never be reached… Mount Everest – the main peak of the Himalayas, the highest peak on Earth, rising 8,882 meters above sea level, stands majestic and precipitous on the edge of our country's southwestern plateau, forming a magnificent natural barrier.

Due to its unparalleled height, unpredictable climate, and extremely treacherous terrain, Mount Everest has remained almost isolated from the world for a long time. Mallory and Irvine, two experienced British mountaineering explorers who were once prominent in the British mountaineering community, attempted to climb Mount Everest from the north slope in 1924. This was the third attempt by British mountaineers to climb this peak. Although they reached a higher altitude than their predecessors – about 8,500 meters above sea level – they never returned from that height.

But today, the myth that the north route of Mount Everest is "unconquerable" has been completely shattered. In this era of miracles, the young Chinese mountaineering team took only two short months to tread snow, climb ice, scale rocks, and open up a path of victory leading to the summit of Mount Everest on what British "explorers" called the "route of death," planting the red flag on the highest point on Earth.

	Marching Towards Mount Everest

On March 19th this year, the Mount Everest area was hit by wind and snow, and dry granular snow drifted like dense fog in the mountains; gusts of piercingly cold wind rolled and swept up sand and stones tens of meters high. Braving the wind, snow, and severe cold of the plateau, the entire Chinese mountaineering team arrived at the foot of Mount Everest.

They stopped at a valley 5,120 meters above sea level at the foot of Mount Everest. This valley was a ridge of a shrunken valley glacier, and the Chinese mountaineers decided to set up the mountaineering team's base camp here.

The captain and deputy captain of the Chinese mountaineering team are Shi Zhanchun and Xu Jing, both famous mountaineering athletes in our country. They have only been participating in mountaineering activities for five years, but they are brave and tenacious. In recent years, they have fought battles in the north and south, leading and organizing Chinese mountaineering teams more than once to conquer many world-famous peaks in our country, building meritorious service in the history of Chinese mountaineering. Today, they are leading our vigorous mountaineers to Mount Everest to engage in a thrilling battle with the fierce natural world. The team members participating in this mountaineering activity come from all parts of the motherland and from all walks of life. Among them are employees of factories and mines in the Northeast, forestry workers from the primitive forests of the Southwest, soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed on the border of the motherland, liberated peasants from rural areas on the Tibetan Plateau, scientific workers from scientific research institutions, and some students from institutions of higher learning.

The cold wind howled madly, huge ice avalanches roared like thunder, snow particles flew, stirring the sky into a chaotic mass. Mount Everest was completely hidden in the white wind and snow, revealing only a black shadow, making it appear even more precipitous and insurmountable.

However, the violence of nature did not frighten the Chinese mountaineers, and their laughter drowned out everything. Here at the foot of Mount Everest, a place rarely visited by humans, they erected a tall flagpole and raised the five-star red flag of the motherland for the first time. They moved away piles of stones and set up yurt tents in the valley; they dug open frozen soil and built stoves at the foot of the mountain… In this place, which not long ago was frequented by wild animals, they officially "settled down."

The mountaineers' lives are colorful. Although it is remote and desolate here, they use their own hands to make it full of life. In the open space between the tents, they erected a few wooden poles, wrapped them with strips of red cloth, and built a symbolic "archway." On both sides of the "door" frame, they wrote couplets they had composed themselves in red pen:

	"Heroes' spirit surpasses mountains and rivers,
	Daring to laugh at Everest's height."

On the walls of their tents, many mountaineers posted slogans and mottos they had written themselves on red or green paper overnight:

	"Even if Everest is higher than the sky,
	It can't compare to the heroes' soaring ambition!
	Treading snow, climbing ice, flying over cliffs,
	We will surely make the red flag flutter on the summit."

The rapidly changing climate in the Mount Everest area brought endless difficulties to the mountaineers. Storms often blew the mountaineers' tents askew, and the team members often had to get up from their sleep and fight the cold wind at about minus twenty degrees Celsius. With heavy snowfall, even the stoves could not be lit, and the team members sometimes found it difficult to even drink boiled water. The severe cold wave forced people to stay in their tents all day long. However, the mountaineers proudly wrote such slogans:

	"Difficulty is a test!
	Perseverance is victory!
	Confidence is success!"

In order to conquer Mount Everest in a relatively short period of time, the Chinese mountaineering team, upon arriving at the foot of the mountain, immediately and rapidly deployed a comprehensive battle line and began preparations from all aspects. Meteorological workers established the first well-equipped meteorological observation station on the desolate slopes of Mount Everest, and various precision meteorological instruments immediately recorded the weather elements of Mount Everest, providing accurate weather forecasts for future mountaineering activities. Radio operators erected tall antenna networks among the rugged and steep rocks, and began to closely connect with all fronts of the motherland. Doctors and nurses were even busier, repeatedly examining the mountaineers' bodies, treating "altitude sickness," so that the mountaineers could maintain their full energy in the harsh environment of high altitude. Logistics cadres continued to rush around, continuously transporting various high-quality modern high-altitude technical equipment, as well as nutritious and varied high-altitude foods and beverages, from all parts of the motherland, providing a strong material guarantee for mountaineering activities.

At the same time, the heads of the mountaineering team and the mountaineers together further studied the relevant information about Mount Everest and formulated an overall plan to conquer the summit of Mount Everest. Based on the experience of conducting high-altitude expeditions in our country in recent years, climbing peaks above 7,000 meters above sea level cannot rely on a single march to achieve victory, but must go through several acclimatization marches, gradually rising and gradually adapting to the high-altitude environment, and then concentrate forces to attack the main peak. Therefore, the mountaineering team headquarters decided to divide the battle to capture the summit of Mount Everest into four "campaigns."

The first campaign – the mountaineers departed from the base camp and reached a place 6,400 meters above sea level, then returned to the base camp to rest;

The second campaign – ascended from the base camp to a place 7,600 meters above sea level, then returned to the base camp to rest;

The third campaign – ascended from the base camp to a place 8,300 meters above sea level, and then returned to the base camp to rest.

During these three acclimatization marches, the mountaineers had to establish many high-altitude camps along the way at different sea levels, creating material conditions for the final capture of the summit. At the same time, the gradual ascent of the team members would also allow them to fully adapt to the high-altitude environment. After this, the fourth campaign required the team members to depart from the base camp and go straight to a place 8,500 meters above sea level, establishing a "assault camp" to capture the main peak, and then set off from this camp to climb the summit of 8,882 meters above sea level.

On March 24, this battle plan to conquer the summit of Mount Everest was repeatedly revised and finally unanimously approved at the general meeting of all team members.

A battle to conquer Mount Everest began here.

	The First March

On March 25, the continuous wind and snow stopped.

A few days ago, the headquarters of the Chinese mountaineering team, based on accurate weather forecasts, decided that all mountaineers would depart from the base camp today and begin the first acclimatization march towards Mount Everest.

At twelve noon, all the mountaineers, carrying mountaineering backpacks and holding ice axes, gathered on the square at the foot of Mount Everest. In the solemn sound of the national anthem, the mountaineers personally slowly raised a five-star red flag into the bright sunny sky. Then, Shi Zhanchun, the captain of the Chinese mountaineering team, issued the order to march towards Mount Everest to the fully equipped mountaineers: "Now, the Chinese mountaineering team begins to advance towards the world's highest peak!"

The mountaineers advanced along the central ridge route of the East Rongbuk Glacier of Mount Everest. The thick ice layer of the East Rongbuk Glacier, like a river, slowly moved down the mountain along the curved mountain valley. The mountaineers had to climb up this steep and slippery ice layer.

In the evening, the mountaineers arrived at the first camp in Mount Everest – a slope 5,400 meters above sea level – facing the cold mountain wind.

Under the rocks near this camp, the mountaineers saw several open spaces surrounded by piles of rubble, with scattered rusty tin cans and blackened leather shoes. Some of the items still had blurred English trademarks on them. These were the remains of the British "explorers." From 1921 to 1938, the British had tried to climb the summit of Mount Everest seven times from here, but none had succeeded.

	A Strange World of Ice and Snow

The next morning, the mountaineers crossed a dangerous stretch of rock and began to enter a strange world of ice and snow – the "ice tongue" area of the East Rongbuk Glacier. Countless ice towers were sometimes sharp and jagged, like bamboo shoots standing tall; sometimes majestic and towering, like pagodas. They were as transparent and white as crystal, as brilliant and dazzling as gemstones, connected to each other and undulating, forming a "forest" of ice and snow. Facing the magnificent scenery in front of them, the mountaineers forgot their fatigue, forgot the danger, cheered, sang, and wandered through the ice peaks and snow towers, constantly capturing them on film with their cameras.

However, the journey in this area became increasingly difficult. People often had to pass through narrow crevices between the ice towers. Under the strong alpine sunlight, the ice surface bubbled, and the sound of ice cracking came from the cracks from time to time. Then, the tips or corners of the ice towers collapsed, and huge fragments of ice and snow scattered in all directions. A little carelessness could lead to danger.

In a section of the glacier where it curved, several ice towers stood side by side, like walls, blocking the entire narrow mountain slope. It seemed that people could only drill through the ice cracks, but obvious signs of ice avalanches indicated that doing so was very dangerous.

The team stopped to find a safer route. Just then, the team members found a strange mark on a rock under an ice tower. Everyone gathered around, and it turned out that there was a piece of paper in a rock crevice. It was left by the reconnaissance group led by Deputy Captain Xu Jing, who was walking ahead of the main force. The note read:

	"Danger! Ice avalanche area.
	Detour by climbing the right side of the mountain slope.
	Do not stay
	Go quickly! Go quickly!"

Looking up, sure enough, on a snow slope more than ten meters high on the right side, the reconnaissance team had used ice axes to dig neat steps in the ice and snow, creating a small path. After walking along the path for a while, the mountaineers reached the second camp in Mount Everest – 5,900 meters above sea level.

A British Mountaineering Victim

It was already the morning of the third day when the mountaineers set off from the second camp. They had passed through the ice tongue area of the East Rongbuk Glacier and began to enter the huge snow basin of the East Rongbuk Glacier – a boundless ice and snow plateau. The ice surface was rugged and extremely slippery, and huge and deep cracks were as dense as spider webs. The ice layer was very hard, and the mountaineers, wearing specially made mountaineering shoes with steel nails, still slipped and stumbled, making it difficult to stand firmly. People fell, got up again, fell again, and got up again.

In the afternoon, the weather suddenly turned bad. The sun drilled into the white clouds, the biting cold wind tore at people's skin, dense granular snow flew in the air, the road could not be seen clearly a few meters away, and on the thermometer, the red line dropped below minus twenty degrees Celsius.

The mountaineers formed "roped teams," protecting each other, exploring the snow in front of them with ice axes, and continuing to climb upwards against the wind and snow.

While passing through a snow field at the foot of a slope, the team suddenly stopped. The mountaineers found a black mass on the snow pile on the side of the road. Upon closer inspection, oh, it turned out to be a corpse. The British-made green down jacket was already tattered and discolored, the corpse was dry and stiff, and the face was already unrecognizable. It seemed that this was a victim of mountaineering from more than twenty years ago. Due to the cold climate, the corpse had not completely decayed. Judging from the body shape and attire, this was an unfortunate British "explorer."

The mountaineers dug open the snow pile with ice axes, buried the corpse, and then continued to move forward.

The sky gradually darkened, and the wind and snow grew heavier. The mountaineers continued to march on this vast ice and snow plateau. People put on down jackets, wore down hats, and hummed in low voices the song they had created themselves – "Song of the Mountaineers" – while stepping on the hard ice under their feet:

	"We are mountaineers,
	We are alpine warriors.
	Going up the glacier in heavy wind and snow,
	The campsite is on top of the ice mountain.
	Ah, comrades, come on,
	Pick up your ice axes and climb the rocks,
	Treading snow and climbing ice, walking on cliffs.
	Oh, oh, oh,
	Let's see who's the tallest on the snow-capped mountain!"

The singing was loud and clear, drowning out the cold and snow, and lingered in the sky above the ice and snow plateau for a long time.

In this way, on March 27, within the scheduled time, the mountaineers reached the intended destination – the third camp at 6,400 meters above sea level, successfully completing the task of the first acclimatization march, and returned to the base camp at the foot of the mountain the next day.

    红旗杆上了珠穆朗玛峰
    新华社记者　郭超人
    银灰色的山峰隐没在浓密的雾层里面，峻峭的山岩上铺盖着一望无边的白雪；一道道浅蓝色的原始冰川，像瀑布一样从万丈悬岩“飞泻”而下；纵深的峡谷曲曲弯弯，好像永远无法走到它的尽头……珠穆朗玛——这座拔海八千八百八十二米的喜马拉雅山脉的主峰、地球上最高的峰峦，巍峨而奇峭，耸立在祖国西南高原的边缘，雄伟壮丽的成为一道天然屏障。
    珠穆朗玛峰由于它举世无比的高度，变幻莫测的气候和极端险恶的地形，使它在过去的漫长年代里，几乎与世隔绝。曾经在英国登山界煊赫一时的两名经验丰富的英国登山探险家马洛里和伊尔文，在1924年从北坡攀登珠穆朗玛峰，这是英国登山家们第三次试图登上这个高峰。虽然比起他们过去的同行们到达了较高的高度——拔海八千五百米左右，但他们就在这样的高度上再没有回来。
    但是今天，珠穆朗玛峰北路“不可征服”的神话被彻底打破了。在我们这个奇迹涌现的时代，年轻的中国登山队仅仅用了短短的两个月的时间，就踏雪蹬冰，飞岩走壁，在英国“探险家”们称为“死亡的路线”上，踩出了一条通向珠穆朗玛顶峰的胜利道路，把红旗插上了这个地球上的制高点。
      向珠穆朗玛峰进军
    今年3月19日，珠穆朗玛山区风雪交加，干燥的粒雪像浓雾一样迷漫在山峦的上空；阵阵刺骨的寒风翻滚，把沙石卷起几十丈高。中国登山队的全体队员们，冒着高原的风雪和严寒，来到了珠穆朗玛峰下。
    他们在珠穆朗玛山下拔海五千一百二十米的一块谷地上停下来，这块谷地是一道已经萎缩的山谷冰川的脊部，中国登山运动员们决定把登山队的大本营设在这里。
    中国登山队队长和副队长是我国著名的登山运动健将史占春和许竞。他们参加登山活动都不过五年的时间，但他们勇敢顽强，几年来南征北战，不止一次地领导和组织我国的登山队，胜利地征服了国内许多座举世闻名的高峰，在我国登山史上树建了功勋。今天，他们又率领我国矫健的登山运动员们来到珠穆朗玛峰，要与凶恶的大自然展开一场惊心动魄的战斗。参加这次登山活动的队员，来自祖国各个地方，各个行业。他们当中有东北厂矿的职员，有西南原始森林里的林业工人，有驻守祖国边疆的人民解放军战士，有西藏高原农村的翻身农民，有科学研究机关的科学工作者，还有一些是高等院校的学生。
    寒风发狂地呼啸，巨大的冰崩发出雷鸣般的轰响，雪粒飞扬着，把天空搅得一片混沌，珠穆朗玛峰完全隐藏到白茫茫的风雪里，只露出一个黑色的影子，更显得险峻和高不可攀。
    但是，大自然的暴力并没有吓倒中国登山运动员们，他们的欢笑声盖住了一切。他们在这人迹罕见的珠穆朗玛峰下，树起高大的旗杆，第一次升起了祖国的五星红旗。他们搬走石堆，在峡谷里搭起一座座毡毛帐篷；挖开冻土，在山坡下砌起一眼眼炉灶……就在这不久前还是野兽出没的地方，他们正式“安家落户”了。
    登山队员们的生活是多彩的。尽管这里偏僻而荒凉，但他们用自己的双手使这里充满了生气。他们在帐篷中间的空地上，支起几根木竿，缠上几条红布，搭成一座象征性的“彩门”。两边“门”框上用红笔写着他们自己编的对联：
      “英雄气盖山河，
    敢笑珠峰不高。”
    在他们居住的帐篷的四壁，许多登山队员连夜张贴上他们自己写在红纸或绿纸上的标语和口号：
    “哪怕珠峰比天高，
    怎比英雄志气豪！
    踏雪蹬冰飞绝壁，
    定叫红旗顶峰飘。”
    珠穆朗玛山区瞬息万变的气候，给登山队员们带来了无穷的困难。暴风常常把登山队员们的帐篷刮得东倒西歪，队员们往往不得不从睡梦中起来与摄氏零下二十度左右的寒风搏斗。大雪纷飞，连炉灶也无法点燃，队员们有时连开水也很难喝上。严酷的寒潮袭来，迫使人们整天不能走出帐篷一步。但是，登山队员们却自豪地写下这样的标语：
    “困难就是考验！
    坚持就是胜利！
    信心就是成功！”
    为了在较短的时间内征服珠穆朗玛峰，中国登山队一到达山下，就立即迅速全面布开了战线，从各个方面开始了准备工作。气象工作人员在珠穆朗玛峰荒漠的山坡上，第一次建立了设备完善的气象观察站，各种精密的气象仪表立刻把珠穆朗玛峰的天气要素记载下来，为未来的登山活动提供准确的气象情况预报。无线电报务员们在崎岖陡峻的山岩间架起了高大的天线网，开始与祖国各个战线紧密联系。医生和护士们更显得忙碌，他们一次又一次地为登山队员们检查身体，治疗“高山病”，使登山队员们在高海拔的恶劣环境下，仍然能保持着充沛的精力。总务干部继续东奔西走，源源不断地从祖国各地运来各种高质量的现代化的高山技术装备，以及营养丰富、品种繁多的高山食品和饮料，为登山活动提供了强有力的物质保证。
    与此同时，登山队队部负责人和登山队员们一道，进一步研究了珠穆朗玛峰的有关资料，制定了征服珠穆朗玛峰顶峰的总体计划。根据我国近几年来进行高峰探险的经验，攀登拔海七千米以上的山峰，不能把希望寄托在一次行军就取得胜利，而必须经过几次适应性行军，逐步上升，逐步适应高山环境，然后集中力量突击主峰。因此，登山队队部决定把夺取珠穆朗玛峰顶峰的战斗分成四个“战役”进行。
    第一个战役——登山队员从大本营出发，到达拔海六千四百米的地方，然后返回大本营休息；
    第二个战役——从大本营上升到拔海七千六百米的地方，然后返回大本营休息；
    第三个战役——从大本营上升到拔海八千三百米的地方，再返回大本营休息。
    在这三次适应性行军中，登山队员们一方面要在沿途不同拔海高度建立起许多个高山营地，为最后夺取顶峰创造物质条件，同时，队员们逐步上升，又能取得对高山环境的充分适应性。在这以后，第四个战役就要求队员们从大本营出发，直抵拔海八千五百米的地方，建立夺取主峰的“突击营地”，然后从这个营地出发登上拔海八千八百八十二米的顶峰。
    3月24日，这个征服珠穆朗玛峰顶峰的战斗计划，经过反复的修订，最后在全体队员大会上一致通过。
    一场征服珠穆朗玛峰的战斗就从这里开始了。
          第一次行军
    3月25日，连绵的风雪停息了。
    几天以前，中国登山队队部就根据准确的气象预报，决定全体登山队员今天从大本营出发，开始向珠穆朗玛峰进行第一次适应性行军。
    中午十二时，全体登山队员们背着登山背包，拿着冰镐，集合在珠穆朗玛山下的广场上。在庄严的国歌声中，登山队员们亲手把一面五星红旗徐徐升上灿烂的晴空。然后，中国登山队队长史占春向整装待发的登山队员们发布向珠穆朗玛峰进军的命令：“现在，中国登山队开始向世界第一高峰挺进！”
    登山队员们是沿着珠穆朗玛峰的东绒布冰川的中脊路线前进的。东绒布冰川坚厚的冰层，像江河一样沿着弯曲的山间峡谷向山下缓慢移动。登山队员们就要踏着这条陡滑的冰层攀登上去。
    傍晚，登山队员们迎着寒冷的山风，来到了珠穆朗玛山中的第一号营地——拔海五千四百米的山坡。
    在这个营地附近的山岩下，登山队员们看到了几个乱石围垒的空地，里面散堆着锈烂的罐头空筒和发黑的皮鞋，有些东西上面还能看到模糊不清的英文商标。这是英国“探险家”们的遗迹。英国人从1921年到1938年，曾经七次从这里试图攀登珠穆朗玛顶峰，但都没有成功。
      奇异的冰雪世界
    第二天清晨，登山队员们翻过一段险峻的山岩以后，开始进入一个奇异的冰雪世界——东绒布冰川的“冰舌”地区。数不清的冰塔有些尖削而峥嵘，像林立的春笋；有些巍峨而高耸，像一座座宝塔。它们像水晶一样透明而洁白，像宝石一样绚丽夺目，彼此毗连起伏，形成了冰雪的“森林”。面对着眼前壮丽的景色，登山队员们忘记了疲劳，忘记了危险，欢呼着，歌唱着，在冰峰雪塔间穿来穿去，不时地用摄影机把它们摄入镜头。
    但是，这一带的路途却变得越来越难走了。人们常常只能从冰塔间的狭窄隙裂中间穿过。在强烈的高山阳光下，冰面冒着气泡，裂缝中不时传出冰块炸裂的声音。接着，冰塔的尖端或侧角崩塌下来，巨大的冰雪碎块纷纷四散，稍不小心，就会遇到危险。
    在一个冰川拐弯的地段，几座冰塔并立在一起，像一座座墙一样，把窄峭的山坡整个堵住了。看来，人们只有从冰缝中间钻过去，但是，显著的冰崩痕迹表明，这样做是很危险的。
    队伍停下来，寻找更安全的路线。正在这时，队员们在冰塔下的一块岩石上发现了一个奇怪的标记。大家围上去，原来在岩石裂缝里放着一个纸条。这是走在大队前面的副队长许竞带领的侦察组留下的。纸条上面写着：
    “危险！冰崩地区。
    攀右侧山坡绕行。
    切勿停留
    速去！速去！”
    抬头观看，果然，在右侧一座十几米高的雪坡上，侦察小组用冰镐在冰雪地上刨出了一级级整齐的台阶，修出了一条小路。沿着小路前走一会，登山队员们到达了珠穆朗玛峰山中的第二号营地——拔海五千九百米的地方。
  一个英国登山的牺牲者
    登山队员们从第二号营地出发，已是第三天的上午了。他们走过了东绒布冰川的冰舌地区，开始进入东绒布冰川的巨大雪盆——一片漫无边际的冰雪台地。冰面坎坷而又异常陡滑，巨阔而深邃的裂缝像蜘蛛网一样密布。冰层十分坚硬，登山队员们穿着特制的镶有钢钉的登山鞋，一步一蹬，仍然滑溜溜的，不容易踩稳。人们跌倒了，又爬起来，再跌倒，再爬起来。
    下午，天气突然变坏了。太阳钻进了白色的云层里，凛冽的寒风撕裂着人们的皮肤，浓密的粒雪在空中翻飞，几米以外就看不清道路，温度计上，红线降到摄氏零下二十度以下。
    登山队员们结成“结组”，彼此保护，用冰镐探索着面前的雪地，顶着风雪继续向上攀登。
    在经过一段山坡下的雪地时，队伍突然停下来。登山队员们在路边的雪堆上发现了一团黑色的东西，上去一看，呵，原来是一具尸体。英国制的绿色鸭绒衣已经破烂变色，尸体干枯而僵硬，面部已经分辨不清。看来，这是二十多年前登山的牺牲者。由于气候寒冷，尸体还没有完全腐坏。从尸体的体形和装束来看，这是一个遭遇不幸的英国的“探险家”。
    登山队员们用冰镐挖开雪堆，把尸体掩埋起来，然后继续前进。
    天色渐渐昏暗下来，风雪更大了。登山队员们继续行进在这片辽阔的冰雪台地上。人们穿起鸭绒衣，戴上鸭绒帽，一边踩着脚下的坚冰，一边兴致勃勃地低声哼唱着他们自己创作的歌曲——“登山队员之歌”：
    “我们是登山队员，
    我们是高山战士。
    大风雪中上冰川，
    冰山上面是营地。
    唉，同志们来呵，
    拿起冰镐上岩石，
    踏雪蹬冰走峭壁。
    唉哟哟，
    雪山顶上见高低！”
    歌声嘹亮，盖住了严寒和风雪，长久地在冰雪台地的上空飘扬。
    就这样，3月27日，在预定的时间内，登山队员们到达了预定的目的地——拔海六千四百米的第三号营地，胜利地完成了第一次适应性行军的任务，第二天又返回到山下的大本营。　（未完）（附图片）
