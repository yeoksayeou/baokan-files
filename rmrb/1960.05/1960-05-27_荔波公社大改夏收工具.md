Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang Dispatch: People of all ethnic groups in the Libo Commune, Dushan County, Guizhou Province, have used various improved tools and machines in a "one-dragon" production line during the summer harvest, achieving high speed. The Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou three-province summer harvesting tool reform experience exchange conference, held here from May 2nd to 7th, promoted the Libo Commune's experience of integrating new summer harvesting tools into a complete set.

During the summer harvest, the Libo Commune promoted and used 1,985 units (pieces) of "Dushan No. 2" ox-drawn harvesters, threshers, large Northern-style winnowing fans, and large sickles. 75% of the wheat was harvested using improved tools and semi-mechanized machines. These new tools improved efficiency by two to six times compared to the old tools. Due to the great power of the new tools, although the total summer harvest area of the commune this year was 1.2 times larger than last year, the harvesting time was shortened by 16 days compared to last year. At the same time, 40% of the labor force was arranged to do other farm work.

The Libo Commune's ability to achieve a major revolution in summer harvesting tools is mainly due to the Party Committee's strengthened leadership, early attention, firm grip, and meticulous approach. As early as March, the Commune Party Committee put forward the slogan "Say goodbye to sickles and carrying poles in the summer harvest," which greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of all commune members to reform summer harvesting tools. The Party Committee Secretary often went deep into the agricultural tool factories and worked with the workers to solve the difficulties of insufficient raw materials and tool equipment, and promptly manufactured various new tools.

    荔波公社大改夏收工具
    据新华社贵阳电　贵州省独山县荔波公社的各族社员，在夏收中把各种改良工具和机器组成“一条龙”，赢得了夏收高速度。5月2日至7日在这里举行的四川、云南、贵州三省夏收工具改革经验交流会议，推广了荔波公社夏收新工具配套成龙的经验。
    荔波公社在夏收中推广使用了“独山二号”牛拉收割机、脱粒机和北方大搧刀、大镰刀共一千九百八十五部（件）。有75％小麦用改良工具和半机械化机器收割。这些新工具分别比旧式工具提高工效二至六倍。由于新工具大显威风，今年全公社的夏收面积虽然比去年扩大一点二倍，但收割时间却比去年缩短十六天，同时，还安排了40％的劳动力去做其他农活。
    荔波公社能够实现夏收工具大革新，主要是党委加强领导，抓得早，抓得狠，抓得细。早在3月份，公社党委就提出了“夏收要和镰刀、扁担告别”的口号，大大鼓舞了全体社员改革夏收工具的积极性。党委书记经常深入农具厂和工人一道，共同解决原材料和工具设备不足的困难，及时制造了各种新工具。
