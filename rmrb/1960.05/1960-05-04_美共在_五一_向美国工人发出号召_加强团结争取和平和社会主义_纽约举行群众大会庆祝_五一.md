Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 1st: New York dispatch: The May 1st issue of the American "Worker's Weekly" published a statement issued by the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States for the International Labor Day of May Day.

The statement said, "Reactionaries will be defeated in our country, and the American working class will march together with its brothers around the world towards a world of peace and socialism."

The statement pointed out that the cause of world peace has made great progress in the past year, and the movement of oppressed nations to strive for freedom and independence has made great progress. In Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the entire system of imperialist oppression is disintegrating.

The statement continued, "In our country, under the leadership of heroic black students, the struggle for full civil rights for blacks and full democracy in the South is flourishing. The American working class has shown an increasingly strong determination to fight for its own interests in the steelworkers' strike and other struggles. The peace movement has made great progress; a large number of organized workers have begun to enter the ranks of the struggle for peace and disarmament.

"The development of socialism and national liberation movements, the increasingly fierce competition of other capitalist countries, and the growing instability of the American economy are making American big business feel increasingly besieged. Its response is typical. When forced, it begins to reassess past policies and try to find new ways to continue to pursue the Cold War policy under new and more unfavorable circumstances."

The statement pointed out that in the United States, big business has launched an anti-labor offensive, especially through some anti-labor laws, launching a movement to completely control and restrict organized labor by the government. The statement said, "But the offensive of big business is encountering increasingly strong resistance. The American working people are becoming more and more determined to defend peace, democracy, civil rights, and their living standards. The struggle is becoming more and more acute."

The statement said, "In the coming months, labor will be increasingly able to take its rightful place at the forefront of the struggle for peace. Labor will unite more and more closely with blacks in the heroic struggle for freedom, in the struggle for the interests of the working class and blacks. Labor will surely find the way to establish its own independent political organization."

Xinhua News Agency, May 3rd: According to a TASS New York dispatch: On the 2nd, a mass meeting attended by thousands of people was held in New York to celebrate the International Labor Day of May Day. Many young workers, college students, and middle school students participated in the meeting.

Police set up wooden fences around the square where the meeting was held; cavalry and infantry were everywhere.

The participants in the mass meeting held up signs and shouted slogans: "Ban Atomic Weapons!" "Salute the Blacks Fighting for Equality!"... Young men and women held huge models of white doves of peace.

One speaker after another took the stage, calling on the American people to carry out unremitting struggles for peace, for universal disarmament, and for civil rights and equality. Their speeches won stormy applause from the participants.

McManus, editor of the "National Guardian," on behalf of all the participants, extended warm greetings to the people of Cuba and other countries who had just been liberated from the shackles of foreign colonialism. He said that Cuba pointed out a path that must be taken for the American continent. His speech won prolonged applause.

The meeting participants passed several resolutions. The resolutions stated that the American people demanded a stop to the testing of atomic and hydrogen bombs, a stop to the arms race, and a striving for peaceful coexistence.

At the meeting, congratulatory messages from the World Federation of Trade Unions, the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions of the Soviet Union, and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to the May Day Preparatory Committee were read out.

    美共在“五一”向美国工人发出号召
    加强团结争取和平和社会主义
    纽约举行群众大会庆祝“五一”
    新华社日内瓦1日电　纽约消息：5月1日一期的美国“工人周报”发表了美国共产党全国委员会为“五一”国际劳动节发表的一篇声明。
    声明说，“反动派在我国将遭到失败，美国的工人阶级将同全世界的兄弟一起向着和平和社会主义的世界迈进。”
    声明指出，世界和平的事业在过去一年有了很大的进展，被压迫民族争取自由、争取独立的运动有了很大的进展。在亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲，整个帝国主义压迫制度正在分崩离析。
    声明接着说，“在我国，在英勇的黑人学生带头的情况下，争取黑人的充分的公民权和南部的充分的民主的斗争正在蓬勃地展开。美国工人阶级在钢铁工人的罢工和在其他的斗争中表现了为保卫自己的利益而斗争的越来越高涨的决心。和平运动取得了巨大的进展；大批有组织的工人开始进入争取和平和裁军的斗争的行列。
    “社会主义和民族解放运动的发展，其他资本主义国家的愈来愈激烈的竞争，美国经济日益增长的不稳定，使美国大企业愈来愈有被包围的感觉。它作出的反应是典型的。在不得已的场合，它开始重新估计过去的政策，企图找出新办法，以便在更为不利的新情况下继续推行冷战方针。”
    声明指出，在美国国内，大企业发动了反劳工的攻势，特别是通过一些反劳工法发动一个使有组织的劳工受政府完全控制和限制的运动。声明说，“可是大企业的攻势正在遇到日益强烈的抵抗。美国劳动人民保卫和平、民主、公民权利和他们的生活水平的决心愈来愈大。斗争正在变得愈来愈尖锐。”
    声明说，“在今后若干月中，劳工将越来越能够在争取和平的斗争的最前列取得它应有的地位。劳工在争取自由的英勇斗争中，在争取工人阶级和黑人的利益的斗争中将同黑人愈来愈紧密地团结起来。劳工一定会找到建立自己独立的政治组织的道路。”
    新华社3日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：2日，在纽约举行了数千人参加的群众大会，庆祝“五一”国际劳动节。参加大会的有许多青年工人、大学生和中学生。
    警察在举行大会的广场周围安设了木栅栏；到处是骑兵和步兵。
    参加群众大会的人举着标语牌和喊着口号：“禁止原子武器！”、“向为平等而斗争的黑人致敬！”……青年男女手中拿着白色的和平鸽的巨大模型。
    上台讲话的人一个紧接一个，他们号召美国人民为和平、为普遍裁军、为公民权利和平等进行不懈的斗争。他们的讲话博得了与会者的暴风雨般的掌声。
    “国民前卫报”主编麦克马纳斯代表全体与会者向刚刚从外国殖民主义束缚下解放出来的古巴和其他国家的人民致热烈敬礼。他说，古巴给美洲大陆指出了一条必须走的道路。他的讲话博得了经久不息的掌声。
    大会参加者通过了几项决议。决议表示美国人民要求停止试验原子弹和氢弹，停止军备竞赛，争取和平共处。
    在大会上宣读了世界工会联合会、全苏工会中央理事会和中华全国总工会给“五一”节筹备委员会发来的贺电。
