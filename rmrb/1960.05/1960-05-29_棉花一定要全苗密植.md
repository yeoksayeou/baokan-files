Cotton has been planted in most parts of our country. This year, the quality of cotton sowing is generally better than in the past, and the amount of sowing has been generally increased. Many cotton fields can achieve full seedlings with one sowing. However, some areas have been attacked and affected by low temperatures, strong winds, rain, and drought after cotton sowing, and the seedlings have emerged unevenly and incompletely. The current urgent task is to immediately check and replant seedlings to resolutely achieve reasonable dense planting of cotton. This is a major key to striving for a bumper cotton harvest this year.

How to strive for high cotton field yields? Some people once advocated increasing production based on sparse planting, relying on increasing the number of bolls per plant; most people advocated increasing the total number of bolls per unit area based on reasonable dense planting, increasing the number of plants within certain conditions and ranges, to achieve high cotton field yields. Which proposition is correct? After several years of extensive experimental research and production practice, especially the practice of the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, it has been fully proven that cotton cultivation should implement reasonable dense planting. Dense planting has been recognized as the central measure of the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture.

This year, various localities have summarized past experiences and further implemented reasonable dense planting of cotton. They have formulated specific plans for reasonable dense planting according to the specific conditions of different varieties, different soil qualities, and different plots, and have carried out sowing according to the plans. However, sowing according to the dense planting plan is only a good start. To ensure the realization of the dense planting plan for cotton fields, it mainly depends on the seedling preservation and thinning situation. Seedling preservation and thinning are important steps to ensure the realization of reasonable dense planting.

In the past, the following often happened: the dense planting standard was set at the time of sowing, but after thinning, the actual number of plants was less than the planned number. Why does this phenomenon occur? There are two reasons: one is that the seedling preservation and thinning work is not done well; and more importantly, it is due to inconsistent understanding of full seedling dense planting of cotton, and right-leaning conservative thinking is at play. Therefore, to pass the full seedling dense planting stage of cotton, it is necessary to not only earnestly do a good job in cotton seedling management, but also pay attention to solving the ideological problems that exist. If the seedling preservation work is not done well, and the phenomenon of missing seedlings and broken ridges occurs, then full seedling dense planting of cotton fields cannot be achieved. However, since the promotion of reasonable dense planting is a major innovation in cotton production technology, there is a constant struggle between advanced and conservative thinking. If ideological obstacles are not resolved, it will not be possible to effectively organize forces and strive for full seedlings, and thus it will not be possible to ensure the realization of the reasonable dense planting plan.

Some people believe that after the density of cotton fields increases, shading increases, and boll shedding increases, it is better to have sparse planting; and dense planting of cotton fields is also more difficult to manage than sparse planting. These views are one-sided. What is currently being promoted in various localities is reasonable dense planting. It has never been said that the denser the better. The so-called reasonable dense planting is to appropriately plan the number of dense planting plants per unit area and the configuration method, and rationally solve the relationship between individuals and groups in the cotton field, so as to ensure the normal growth and development of individuals (each single plant), and to enable the group (the whole field of cotton plants) to be fully developed and increase the total number of bolls in the whole field. In the case of sparse planting, although individuals can be fully developed, due to the insufficient distribution of plants per unit area, the nutrition and light energy of the land cannot be fully utilized, and the group development is insufficient. Even if a single plant bears more bolls, the total number of bolls in the whole field still cannot catch up with the number of reasonable dense planting, and the yield is naturally not as high as reasonable dense planting. This principle is very clear. We cannot be confused by the one-sided phenomenon of large single plants and many bolls in sparse planting, and only calculate the accounts of single plants, not the total accounts of the whole field.

Of course, we must deal with the problem of possible increased shading and increased boll shedding after dense planting of cotton fields in a realistic manner. There are also two different attitudes towards this issue: one is a passive and conservative attitude, believing that this is a disadvantage brought about by dense planting and cannot be overcome; the other is an innovative and progressive attitude, that is, taking effective measures to solve the new contradictions and new problems caused by dense planting, and constantly giving play to the role of dense planting in increasing production. The practice of many high-yield areas has proven that as long as the row and plant spacing is reasonably configured, water and fertilizer conditions are appropriately controlled, and field management is strengthened, the impact of increased shading in densely planted cotton fields can be overcome, and the boll setting rate of single plants can also be improved.

In order to achieve reasonable dense planting, many cotton areas have carried out seedling checking, replanting, and strengthening seedling management, which is very important. The period of cotton seedling management is relatively long, and there are many factors that may affect emergence and cause missing seedlings and broken ridges; on the other hand, precisely because the period of seedling management is relatively long, the possibility of remedying and overcoming the phenomenon of missing seedlings and broken ridges is also greater. We must strengthen seedling management step by step with the greatest determination and perseverance, and constantly fight against unfavorable natural conditions to ensure the realization of reasonable dense planting. Replant immediately if seedlings do not emerge, and replant immediately if seedlings are missing, resolutely eliminating the phenomenon of missing seedlings and broken ridges. We must do everything possible to ensure full seedlings in cotton fields and to ensure dense planting in cotton fields. Various localities have rich experience in cotton field seedling preservation and seedling management. As long as we are determined to do it, we will definitely be able to achieve reasonable dense planting, and the seedlings will be full and strong.

### 棉花一定要全苗密植

    棉花一定要全苗密植
    我国大部地区的棉花都种完了。今年棉花播种质量一般都比过去好，普遍增加了播种量，许多棉田可以达到一次播种一次全苗。但是，有些地区，在棉花播种后，受了低温、大风、阴雨、干旱的袭击和影响，苗出得不齐不全。当前的紧急任务是立即查苗补苗，坚决做到棉花合理密植，这是争取今年棉花丰收的一大关键。
    怎样争取棉田丰产？有些人曾经主张以稀植为基础，依靠增加单株的结铃数增产；大多数人主张以合理密植为基础，在一定的条件和范围内增加株数，从而增加单位面积内的总铃数，来实现棉田丰产。究竟是哪一种主张对？经过几年来大量的试验研究和生产实践，特别是农业生产大跃进的实践，完全证明了种植棉花应该实行合理密植。密植，已被公认是农业“八字宪法”的中心措施。
    今年，各地总结了过去的经验，进一步贯彻实行棉花合理密植，按照不同品种、不同土质、不同地块的具体情况，分别制订了合理密植的具体规划，按照规划进行播种。但是，按密植规划播种只是一个良好的开端，要保证棉田密植规划的实现，主要还要看保苗情况怎样，定苗情况怎样。保苗、定苗是保证实现合理密植的重要一关。
    过去常常发生这样的情况：播种时定好了密植标准，到了定苗以后，实际的株数却比规划数减少了。为什么会产生这种现象呢？原因有两个：一个是保苗、定苗工作做得不好；而更重要的是由于对棉花全苗密植认识不一致，右倾保守思想在作怪。因此，要过好棉花全苗密植关，既要切实做好棉花苗期管理工作，又要注意解决思想上存在的问题。保苗工作做不好，发生了缺苗断垅的现象，棉田的全苗密植自然就谈不到了。可是，由于推行合理密植是棉花生产技术上一项重大的革新，存在着先进思想和保守思想的不断斗争，如果思想上的障碍不解决，就不会有效地组织力量，力争全苗，因而也就不能保证实现合理密植规划。
    有人认为，棉田密度增加以后，荫蔽加重，蕾铃脱落增多，不如稀植为好；而且棉田密植后，也比稀植难管理些。这些看法是片面的。现在各地推行的是合理密植，从来也没有说，愈密就是愈好。所谓合理密植，就是要适当地规划单位面积的密植株数和配置方式，合理地解决棉田中个体和群体的关系，既保证个体（每一单株）的正常生长发育，又能使群体（全田棉株）得到充分的发展，增加全田总铃数。在稀植的情况下，虽然个体可以得到充分的发展，但因单位面积上没有分布足够的株数，不能充分利用土地的营养和光能，群体发展不够，即使单株结铃较多，全田总铃数仍然赶不上合理密植的多，产量自然不如合理密植的高。这个道理本来是很明白的。我们不能被稀植的单株发棵大、结铃多的片面现象所迷惑，只算单株的账，不算全田的总账。
    当然，我们必须实事求是地对待棉田密植后荫蔽可能加重，蕾铃脱落可能增多的问题。在这个问题上，也有两种不同的态度：一种是消极保守的态度，认定这是密植带来的不利条件，是不能克服的；另一种是革新进取的态度，即采取有效措施，解决因密植而产生的新矛盾、新问题，不断地发挥密植增产的作用。很多丰产地区的实践已经证明：只要合理地配置行株距，适当地掌握水、肥条件，加强田间管理，密植棉田中荫蔽加重的影响是可以克服的，单株的成铃率同样可以提高。
    为了实现合理密植，许多棉区开展了查苗、补种和加强苗期管理的工作，这是十分重要的。棉花苗期管理的时期比较长，可能影响出苗、引起缺苗断垅的因素比较多；另一方面，正由于苗期管理的时期比较长，补救和克服缺苗断垅现象的可能也更大。我们必须用最大的决心和毅力，一步不放松地加强苗期管理，不断地同不利的自然条件作斗争，保证实现合理密植。出不了苗的立即重种，缺了苗的立即补种，坚决消灭缺苗断垅现象。我们要尽一切努力，保证棉田全苗，保证棉田密植。各地都有丰富的棉田保苗和苗期管理的经验，只要决心去做，一定能够做到合理密植，苗全苗壮。
