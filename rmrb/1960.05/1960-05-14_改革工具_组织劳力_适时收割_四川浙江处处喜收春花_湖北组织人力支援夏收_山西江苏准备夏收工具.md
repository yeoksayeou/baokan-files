Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, May 13th: Sichuan Province's more than 50 million mu of small spring crops have had a bumper harvest, and the rush harvest is now fully underway from south to north. As of May 10th, the province had rushed to harvest more than 24 million mu of crops such as wheat, rapeseed, broad beans, and peas.

This year, Sichuan Province's small spring crops were planted in greater quantities and grew well, and the maturity period was relatively uniform. Therefore, the harvest volume is greater than in any previous year. In order to ensure a full harvest of the bumper crop, various localities, according to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, have invested 70%-80% of the labor force in the front line of agricultural production, while also vigorously promoting tool reforms. The Nanchong, Wenjiang, Dazhou, and Fuling special districts alone have promoted more than one million pieces of improved summer harvesting tools. The Xichang special district has newly built more than 4,000 drying grounds this year, manufactured more than 2,000 double-knife and triple-knife wheat rapid harvesting devices, and built more than 1,800 kilometers of field roads. Due to the complete set of innovative tools, the summer harvest progress has been greatly accelerated. While vigorously reforming summer harvesting tools, Gao County also rationally organized the labor force, formed specialized teams for cutting, transporting, threshing, and drying, and adopted the method of corps operations, attacking in concentrated areas. The entire county basically completed the harvest of more than 279,000 mu of small spring crops in just four days.

In the rush harvest, all localities have also paid special attention to careful threshing and harvesting, striving to return every grain to the granary. After summarizing past experience, communes in Wusheng, Zizhong, and Anyue counties generally implemented the method of harvesting and threshing simultaneously or harvesting and threshing in the morning and evening, greatly reducing grain losses during harvesting and threshing. In harvesting, the communes in Junlian County achieved three lights and two cleans, namely light cutting, light lifting, light placing, and clean cutting, clean picking.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, May 13th: Zhejiang Province's more than 10 million mu of spring crops such as wheat and rapeseed are gradually ripening, and the harvesting work is fully underway from south to north. In the rush harvest, various localities are focusing on careful harvesting and threshing, striving to bring every grain into the granary and achieve a bumper harvest.

This year, Zhejiang's spring flower harvest area is large, the yield is high, and the maturity is early. The harvest workload will be greatly increased compared to previous years. The Zhejiang Provincial People's Committee issued a notice early on, requiring all localities to earnestly do a good job in timely harvesting and careful harvesting and threshing. Communes in various localities rationally arranged the labor force, organized harvesting professional teams, classified and lined up the spring flower fields by plot, arranged the harvesting order, and harvested as soon as they ripened, harvesting in a timely manner. At the same time, a production responsibility system has been established in all links such as harvesting, transportation, stacking, threshing, turning and drying, and warehousing, striving for one-time clean threshing and no loss of a single ear. Due to the establishment of more than 35,000 specialized teams for harvesting, threshing, and turning and drying, and the implementation of the responsibility system, communes in the Wenzhou special district have mostly harvested the more than 1 million mu of wheat, barley, and rapeseed that have been harvested quickly and cleanly.

In the spring flower harvest, various localities vigorously innovated old tools and promoted new tools, greatly improving work efficiency and harvesting quality. The Huamulan group of the Xincheng commune in Rui'an County, which is famous throughout the province for its careful harvesting and threshing, innovated the rapeseed thresher and modified the wheat thresher this year. The threshing is fast and clean, and each mu can harvest three more catties of rapeseed and ten catties of wheat.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, May 13th: Hubei Province has entered the busy season of wheat harvesting and rice transplanting. In order to ensure that both summer harvesting and summer planting are done well at the same time, people from all walks of life, such as workers, soldiers, students, merchants, and cadres of organs in various cities and towns throughout the province, have warmly responded to the call of the Provincial Party Committee and are vying to sign up to go to the countryside to provide support. Xiangyang special district, the main wheat-producing area of the province, organized 600,000 people from all walks of life to go to the countryside to assist in summer harvesting and summer planting. The organs and towns in Jingzhou special district have already sent 150,000 people to the countryside to support farmers in harvesting wheat and rush-transplanting rice. Huanggang special district, which is famous for its early rice production, began mobilizing a large number of people from organs and towns to go to the countryside as early as April to carry out shock transplanting work. With the support of this fresh force, the summer harvesting and summer planting work in various localities is progressing rapidly.

In addition to dispatching a large number of cadres and staff to the countryside to directly participate in production, various departments such as industry, finance and trade, health, and culture and art in various localities have also tried every means to support summer harvesting and summer planting from all aspects. Dangyang, Xingshan, and Yidu counties transferred more than 1,000 technicians from county and commune factories and enterprises, bringing more than 400 sets of red furnaces to the countryside to rush to manufacture and repair various tools for summer harvesting and summer planting. The 1,000-strong delivery army organized by the commercial departments of Hong'an County not only delivered goods to the door, but also squeezed out time to participate in production.

Hubei Province's summer harvest area this year is large, the crops are growing well, and the workload of harvesting, threshing, and transportation has increased significantly compared to previous years. The area of early, middle rice and other summer-sown crops has increased compared to previous years, and the quality requirements are also high. In order to successfully complete the summer harvesting and summer planting tasks, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held an enlarged meeting on May 6th, deciding that the province would organize 150,000 cadres to go to the countryside and factories to participate in and guide production, and requiring each person to work for 15 to 20 working days.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan: Various localities in Shanxi are actively reforming tools to welcome the summer harvest. According to recent statistics, the province has innovated and promoted more than 766,000 pieces of harvesting, transportation, and threshing machinery, 4.6 times more than in the same period last year.

This year, the wheat harvest area in Shanxi Province has expanded by more than 1.9 million mu compared to last year. The wheat on the large-scale high-yield plots in various localities is growing uniformly, and the harvesting time is concentrated. According to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, a tool reform movement focusing on the innovation of harvesting, transportation, and threshing tools was launched in March. Various localities have manufactured and promoted large quantities of the finalized "Taigu" harvester, the "59-1" thresher, and various simple small handcarts.

Various localities have also paid attention to preparing small tools for the summer harvest. While promoting innovative tools in large quantities, the Jinan special district prepared more than 630,000 small tools, making the entire summer harvest tool set a combination of large and small, with everything available.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing: The agricultural technology innovation and technical revolution movement centered on the reform of summer harvesting and summer planting tools is sweeping across rural areas in Jiangsu Province.

The rice-wheat dual-purpose rapid harvester recently created successfully in the Yancheng special district is pulled by one cow and operated by four people, and can harvest 30 mu of rice and wheat in eight hours, with a work efficiency more than six times higher than manual labor. From January to April, various localities throughout the province also newly manufactured more than 24 million pieces of various medium and small-sized farm tools. Currently, many areas have prepared complete sets of small farm tools for summer harvesting and summer planting.

In the summer harvesting and summer planting tool reform, party committees at all levels are led by the secretaries, and based on county and commune industries and with workers as the backbone, they have strengthened the support of industry for agriculture and the support of cities for rural areas. Rural areas have also formed technical innovation and technical revolution professional teams mainly composed of skilled farmers, manufacturing various tools in batches and items, so the movement is progressing rapidly.

In the process of the movement's development, many counties, communes, and brigades have resolutely implemented the policy of relying mainly on indigenous methods and combining indigenous and foreign methods, achieving simultaneous manufacturing, appraisal, training, and promotion.

    改革工具　组织劳力　适时收割   
    四川浙江处处喜收春花
    湖北组织人力支援夏收　山西江苏准备夏收工具
    据新华社成都13日电　四川省五千多万亩小春作物大丰收，目前抢收工作已由南向北全面展开。到5月10日止，全省已抢收小麦、油菜、蚕豆、豌豆等作物二千四百多万亩。
    今年，四川省小春作物种得多、长得好，成熟期也比较整齐，因此收获量比以往任何一年都大。为了确保丰产全收，各地根据省委指示，已将劳动力的70％—80％投入农业生产第一线，同时大搞工具改革。仅南充、温江、达县、涪陵等专区就推广夏收改良工具一百多万件。西昌专区今年新修晒坝四千多个，制造双刀式和三刀式小麦快速收割器二千多件，建田间车路一千八百多公里。由于成套革新工具，夏收进度大大加快。高县在大力改革夏收工具的同时，还合理组织劳力、组成割、运、打、晒等专业队，采取兵团作战的办法，成片突击，全县仅用四天时间就基本上收完二十七万九千多亩小春作物。
    各地在抢收中还特别注意精打细收，力争颗粒还仓。武胜、资中、安岳等县各公社在总结往年经验后普遍实行了边收边打或早晚收打的办法，大大减少了粮食收打时的损失。筠连县各公社在收割中做到了三轻两净，即轻割、轻提、轻放和割净、拣净。
    据新华社杭州13日电　浙江省一千多万亩小麦、油菜等春花作物陆续黄熟，收割工作正由南向北全面展开。各地在抢收中，大抓细收细打，力争颗粒归仓，丰产丰收。
    浙江今年春花收获面积大、产量高、成熟早，收获工作量将比往年大大增加。浙江省人民委员会及早发出了通知，要求各地切实做好适时收获、细收细打工作。各地公社合理安排劳力，组织收割专业队，把春花田逐丘分类排队，安排收割次序，随熟随割，适时收割。同时，在收割、运输、堆放、脱粒、翻晒、入库等各个环节上，都建立了生产责任制，力争一次打净，一穗不丢。温州专区各公社，由于建立了三万五千多个收割、脱粒、翻晒等专业队和实行了责任制，目前全区已收的一百多万亩大小麦和油菜，绝大部分收得又快又净。
    在收获春花中，各地大力革新旧工具和推广新式工具，大大提高了工作效率和收打质量。以细收细打闻名全省的瑞安县莘塍公社花木兰小组，今年革新了油菜脱粒机，改装了小麦脱粒机，脱粒时又快又净，每亩可多收三斤菜子，十斤麦子。
    据新华社武汉13日电　湖北省已进入割麦、插秧的大忙季节。为了保证同时做好夏收夏种工作，全省各个城镇的工、兵、学、商和机关干部等各行各业人员，都热烈响应省委号召，争相报名下乡支援。全省主要产麦区——襄阳专区，组织了六十万名各行各业人员下乡协助夏收、夏种。荆州专区各级机关和城镇已有十五万人下乡支援农民收割小麦和抢插水稻。以盛产早稻著名的黄冈专区，早在4月间就开始在机关和城镇动员大批人员下乡，突击插秧工作。在这批生力军的支援下，各地夏收夏种工作正在迅速进展。
    各地工业、财贸、卫生和文化艺术等各部门，除了抽出大批干部和工作人员下乡直接参加生产外，还千方百计地从各个方面支援夏收夏种。当阳、兴山、宜都三县从县、社工厂企业抽调一千多名技术工人，带上四百多盘红炉下乡，为夏收夏种赶制和修配各种工具。红安县商业部门组织的一千人的送货大军，一边送货上门，一边挤出时间参加生产。
    湖北省今年夏收作物面积大，长得好，收割、脱粒和运输等各项工作量都比往年增加很多。早、中稻和夏播其他作物的面积比往年增多，质量要求也高。为了胜利完成夏收和夏种任务，中共湖北省委在5月6日曾举行扩大会议，决定全省组织十五万名干部下乡下厂，参加生产和指导生产，并要求每人要做到十五个到二十个工作日。
    据新华社太原电　山西各地积极改革工具，迎接夏收。据最近统计，全省已革新推广收割、运输、脱粒机具七十六万六千多件，比去年同期多推广了四点六倍。
    今年，山西省麦收面积比去年扩大了一百九十多万亩；各地大面积丰产方上的小麦，长得整齐划一，收割时间集中。根据省委指示，各地在3月间就掀起了以革新收割、运输和脱粒工具为主的工具改革运动。各地都大量制造和推广了已经定型的“太谷号”收割机、“五九—一型”脱粒机和各式各样简易小手车。
    各地对准备夏收小工具也很注意。晋南专区在大批推广革新工具的同时，准备了六十三万多件小工具，使整个夏收工具大小搭配，应有尽有。
    据新华社南京电　江苏省各地农村以改革夏收夏种工具为中心的农业技术革新和技术革命运动，正在席卷全省。
    盐城专区最近创制成功的稻麦两用快速收割机，一牛牵引，四人操作，八小时可收割三十亩稻麦，工效比人工提高六倍以上。全省各地从1至4月份还新制各种中小型农具二千四百多万件。目前有很多地区夏收夏种的小农具已准备齐全。
    在夏收夏种工具改革中，各级党委都由书记挂帅，并以县、社工业为基础，以工人为骨干，加强了工业对农业的支援，城市对农村的支援；农村也以有技术的农民为主，组成技术革新和技术革命专业队伍，分期分项制造各种工具，因此运动进展迅速。
    在运动发展过程中，许多县、公社和大队，都坚决贯彻了以土为主、土洋并举的方针，做到边制造、边鉴定、边训练、边推广。
