(Our newspaper, Zhengzhou, May 25th) Wang Tianxiang, a young driver from the Third Team of the Xuchang Highway Transportation Company in Henan Province, has continuously achieved outstanding results in vehicle ton-month production (the amount of transportation per ton of carrying capacity per month), ranging from 100,000 ton-kilometers to 170,000 ton-kilometers, over the past five months, setting a brilliant example for highway transportation workers nationwide.

Wang Tianxiang's truck achieved a monthly output of 101,102 ton-kilometers in December of last year. This year, Wang Tianxiang has vigorously engaged in technological innovation and revolution, and the vehicle ton-month production indicators have risen steadily. In April, the vehicle ton-month production reached 170,000 ton-kilometers, with an average daily vehicle mileage of 800 kilometers, an increase of more than 40% compared to 550 kilometers in November of last year. The vehicle ton-kilometer cost is only two fen and change (the provincial average fuel consumption per vehicle ton-kilometer is more than one jiao).

Twenty-two-year-old Wang Tianxiang and his co-driver Zhang Wenrui are both members of the Communist Youth League. Their able assistants, Shen Guoling, is a Communist Party member, and Guo Jiaqi is a member of the Communist Youth League. They drive a Zil-164 truck with a 100-horsepower engine and a designed carrying capacity of four tons, towing three to ten or more trailers, effectively carrying six to eight tons. The primary and secondary drivers each take an assistant and work in two shifts on the highway from Xuchang to Lushan, making three and a half round trips a day.

The fundamental reason why Wang Tianxiang's truck can maintain continuous high production is that they resolutely listen to the Party and unswervingly implement the decisions of the company's Party committee at all times and in all places. When the company's Party committee called for carrying out a "ten thousand ton-kilometer" high-yield campaign in the fourth quarter of last year, Wang Tianxiang and his team first proposed the fighting slogan: "Seize every second and demand efficiency from time." They implemented fixed-route loop transportation and drop-and-hook transportation. Based on the characteristics of material distribution and collection along the way, they changed the short-distance linear transportation of a single round trip from Xuchang to Lushan into a double-trip long-distance circular line transportation from Xuchang to Lushan to Yuxian to Xuchang. At the same time, they fixed the number of trailers and performed drop-and-hook operations at both the terminal and starting stations. After implementing this measure, all loading and unloading points grasped the law of driving and organized sufficient sources of goods and arranged loading and unloading forces in advance. As soon as the truck arrived, it drove into the freight yard. After one main truck was loaded and unloaded, it immediately hooked up with three trailers that had already been loaded with goods and continued driving, fundamentally changing the past situation where the truck arrived at the station, the driver temporarily looked for cargo owners, freight yards, and loading and unloading workers to wait for loading and unloading, wasting transportation capacity. The time spent on each loading and unloading procedure was reduced from ninety minutes to fifteen to twenty minutes. Loading and unloading three times a day saved more than three hours. Because of drop-and-hook transportation, the trailers have ample time, and the quality of maintenance and repair work has also been significantly improved, eliminating the phenomenon of accidents, parking for repairs, and delays in production due to trailers on the way. Another measure they implemented was to closely integrate driving and maintenance and repair, and move the first-level maintenance and general minor repair work from the workshop to the site. When the truck arrives at the station, it is maintained and repaired while loading and unloading, ensuring that the first-level maintenance does not take up driving time, saving more than half an hour per day for production.

Overcoming backward thinking, establishing lofty ambitions, and working hard and cleverly without fear of any difficulties is another important reason why Wang Tianxiang achieved outstanding results. The past production situation of Wang Tianxiang's truck was not good. Before the beginning of last year, the vehicle ton-month production of this truck was only a few thousand ton-kilometers. In the past, Wang Tianxiang was very lazy, liked to go to game places to listen to "storytelling", and liked to wander around in movie theaters. He had been criticized by the workers. Thanks to the patient help and education of the leading comrades of the Party and Youth League branches, he was determined to overcome ideological shortcomings such as getting by and not being content with his work, and strive for a double leap forward in ideology and production. In May of last year, Wang Tianxiang's truck achieved ten thousand ton-kilometers for the first time. In September of last year, young driver Yang Songbo created a new record of double ten thousand ton-kilometers in monthly production, throwing Wang Tianxiang's truck behind again. He and Zhang Wenrui carefully studied and learned Yang Songbo's set of high-yield experiences, such as multi-trailer, compressing handover and loading and unloading time, cherishing the truck, and paying attention to safety. At the same time, they adopted many measures to haul more and run faster, increasing the truck's running time and cargo volume.

Another important reason why Wang Tianxiang's truck has continuously maintained the honor of a model for hauling more and running faster is that the four young people led by Wang Tianxiang are closely united, and they are very well united with the workers in maintenance, repair, and other relevant units, so they receive the support of the broad masses of workers everywhere. For example, maintenance workers do not spare any effort to move maintenance work from the workshop to the site as much as possible; decoration technicians have added cooling water tanks to the truck to prevent the truck from overheating and causing accidents during high-speed operation; they have also helped Wang Tianxiang reinforce the axles, raise the truck troughs, etc., which improved the vehicle's load capacity and safety factor.

Currently, highway transportation companies in various parts of Henan Province are carrying out a campaign to "learn from Wang Tianxiang, catch up with Wang Tianxiang, and surpass Wang Tianxiang." Trucks with high vehicle ton-month production of 100,000 ton-kilometers have appeared in Luoyang, Xinxiang, Nanyang, and other places. Yang Songbo, Liu Dongjin, and others have also reached a vehicle ton-month production of 150,000 ton-kilometers. Wang Tianxiang and his team are also constantly promoting new technological innovation measures and strive to create even more outstanding achievements.

    王天祥连创汽车多拉快跑新纪录
    车吨月产达到十七万吨公里　吨公里成本只有二分多钱
    本报郑州25日电　河南省许昌公路运输公司第三车队青年司机王天祥，五个月来，连续创造了车吨月产（每一个载重吨位一个月的运输量）十万吨公里到十七万吨公里的出色成绩，为全国公路运输职工树立了光辉的榜样。
    王天祥驾驶的汽车，在去年12月月产达到十万一千一百零二吨公里。今年，王天祥大搞技术革新和技术革命，车吨月产指标又节节上升。4月份车吨月产达到十七万吨公里，平均车日行程为八百公里，比去年11月份的五百五十多公里提高了40％多，车吨公里成本只有二分多钱（全省平均车吨公里耗油为一角钱以上）。
    二十二岁的王天祥和副司机张文瑞都是共青团员。他们的得力助手沈国岭是共产党员，郭家奇是共青团员。他们驾驶一部吉尔164型汽车，引擎一百马力，设计载重量为四吨，拖挂实载六吨到八吨的拖车三个到十个以上。正副司机各带一个助手分两班在由许昌到鲁山的公路线上运货，一天三个半往返。
    王天祥驾驶的汽车能够持续高产的根本原因是：他们坚决听党的话，随时随地都坚定不移地贯彻执行公司党委的决定。当去年第四季度公司党委号召开展“万吨公里”高产运动时，王天祥他们首先提出了：“分秒必争，向时间要效率”的战斗口号。他们实行了定线循环运输和甩挂运输，根据沿途物资集散特点，将许昌到鲁山单程来回短途直线运输，改为许昌—鲁山—禹县—许昌的双程长途环形线运输，同时固定挂车数量，在终点和起点站两头进行甩挂。实行这项措施以后，各装卸点掌握了行车的规律，事前都组织好充足的货源，安排好装卸力量，汽车一到就开进货场，一个主车装卸完毕，马上挂上早已装妥货物的三个挂车继续行驶，根本上改变了过去汽车到站，司机临时找货主、货场、装卸工人等待装待卸、浪费运力的情况。每次装卸办手续占用的时间由九十分钟压缩到十五分钟到二十分钟。每天装卸三次，节约了三个多小时。因为甩挂运输，挂车时间充裕，保养修理工作的质量也显著提高，消灭了中途挂车出事故、停车检修、延误生产的现象。他们实行的另一个措施是，把行车和保养修理密切结合起来，把一级保养一般小修工作由车间搬到现场。汽车到站，一面装卸，一面进行保养修理，做到一级保养不占行车时间，每天节省半个多小时用于生产。
    克服落后思想，树立雄心大志，苦干巧干不畏一切困难，是王天祥创造出色成绩的另一个重要原因。王天祥驾驶的汽车过去的生产情况并不好。去年年初以前，这部车的车吨月产量只有几千吨公里。过去王天祥很懒散，爱到游戏场所听“说书”，爱在电影院里转来转去，曾经受到过职工们的批评。由于党、团支部的领导同志耐心地对他进行帮助教育，他下定决心克服得过且过、不安心工作等思想毛病，力争思想、生产双跃进。去年5月，王天祥驾驶的汽车第一次实现了万吨公里。去年9月，青年司机杨松波创造了月产双万吨公里的新纪录，又把王天祥驾驶的汽车甩到后面了。他和张文瑞认真研究和学习了杨松波多挂车、压缩交接班和装卸货时间、爱护车子注意安全等一套高产经验，同时采用了许多多拉快跑的措施，增加了汽车的运行时间和载货数量。
    王天祥驾驶的汽车连续保持多拉快跑标兵荣誉的另一个重要原因是：以王天祥为首的四个青年人团结得亲密无间，他们同保养修理等各有关单位的职工团结得很好，因此处处得到广大职工的支持。例如，保修工不辞劳苦，尽可能地把保养工作由车间搬到现场；装修技工为车上添设了散热水箱，防止车子在高速运转时温度过高，引起事故；他们还帮助王天祥加固车轴，加高车槽等，提高了车辆载重量和安全系数。
    现在，河南省各地公路运输公司都在开展“学王天祥，赶王天祥，超王天祥”的运动。漯河、新乡、南阳等地都出现了车吨高产月十万吨公里的汽车。杨松波、刘东晋等还达到了车吨月产十五万吨公里。王天祥他们也在不断推行新的技术革新措施，力争创造更出色的成绩。
