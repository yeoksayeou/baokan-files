Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, 20th Dispatch: Yugoslav newspapers continue to shamelessly place the responsibility for the collapse of the Four-Power Summit on the Soviet Union, thus relieving its robber master, American imperialism, which was caught red-handed.

The "Politika" newspaper, in its commentary on the 19th, echoed the imperialists' tune, portraying the U.S. plane's intrusion into Soviet airspace as an insignificant matter, saying "such conflict incidents are, in fact, just one of many in the past decade." Following this, it made a counter-charge, attacking the Soviet Union, saying that the U.S. plane intrusion incident "cannot and should not become a reason or excuse to hinder the resolution of practical and fundamental issues in international relations." It frantically clamored that the interruption of the meeting caused by this "sharply raised the international and historical responsibility of the meeting participants and contemporaries for any deterioration and exacerbation of international relations that may occur in the future."

The newspaper also subtly accused the Soviet Union of "not doing so when it was possible to seriously discuss the most important international issues, but instead putting conflicts of prestige and struggles for public opinion in the first place."

Yugoslav newspapers have also recently published a large number of malicious slanders against the Soviet Union from Western bourgeois newspapers and news agencies. In order to cover up their lackey-like behavior of serving imperialism, these newspapers also publish some news condemning the United States; but behind this disguise, they launch open and covert attacks on the Soviet Union. The headlines and content of the "Politika" newspaper's report on the 18th, from its correspondents in Western countries and Western news agencies, which slandered the Soviet Union, were: "Today, all newspapers unanimously attack the Soviet Premier. They assert... Khrushchev is responsible for the failure of the summit"; "Here, such comments from all regions of the world are quickly reprinted: They turn their anger towards Khrushchev. He (referring to Khrushchev) is the one who should be held responsible for destroying the summit."

The headlines and content of similar dirty reports published by "Borba" include: "American newspapers support Eisenhower's opinion on this matter: The Soviet Premier 'came to the Paris meeting with a plan prepared in Moscow to destroy it'"; "Most commentators here believe that the Soviet Premier is responsible for this situation," etc.

    袒护美国侵略罪行　攻击苏联正义立场
    南斯拉夫报纸再次现原形
    据新华社20日讯　贝尔格莱德消息：南斯拉夫报纸继续无耻地把四国政府首脑会议破裂的责任硬栽到苏联头上，这样来为被当场抓住的它的强盗主子美帝国主义解围。
      “政治报”19日在评论中按照帝国主义者的腔调，把美机侵犯苏联领空事件说做是无所谓的小事，它说什么“这样的冲突事件——其实只是近十年来许多次当中的一次”。跟着它就倒打一耙，攻击苏联说，美机侵苏事件“不能够、也不应当成为妨碍解决国际关系中的实际问题和基本问题的原因和借口”。它疯狂地叫嚣，由此而造成的会议中断，“尖锐地提出了会议参加者和当代人对今后可能发生的国际关系的任何恶化和尖锐化的国际的和历史的责任问题”。
    这家报纸还含沙射影地指责苏联“有可能认真地会谈最重大的国际问题的时候，没有这样做，却反而把威望的冲突和争夺舆论的斗争放到了第一位”。
    南斯拉夫的报刊最近还大量刊载西方资产阶级报纸和通讯社恶毒污蔑苏联的言论。为了掩饰它们的为帝国主义效劳的奴才相，这些报纸也略登一些谴责美国的消息；但在这个伪装背后却向苏联明枪暗箭乱发。“政治报”18日刊载的它的驻西方国家记者和西方通讯社污蔑苏联的消息的标题和内容是：“今天各报全体一致攻击苏联总理。他们断定……赫鲁晓夫应对最高级会议的失败负责”；“这里迅速地转载了世界一切地区的这种评论：他们把愤怒转向了赫鲁晓夫。他（按指赫鲁晓夫）是应该对破坏首脑会议负责的人”。
    “战斗报”刊登这类肮脏报道的标题和内容有：“美国报刊在这方面支持艾森豪威尔的意见：苏联总理‘带着在莫斯科准备的计划来破坏巴黎会议’”；“这里的大多数评论家认为，苏联总理要对这种情况负责”等等。
