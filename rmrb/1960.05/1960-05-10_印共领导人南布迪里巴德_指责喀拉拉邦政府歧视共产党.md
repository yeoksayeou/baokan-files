Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 7th May. The "New Century" weekly, published on May 8th, reported that the leader of the opposition in the Kerala Legislative Assembly, Communist Party of India leader Namboodiripad, in a letter to the Chief Minister and Home Minister of Kerala, accused the Congress Party and People's Socialist Party coalition government of Kerala of wantonly adopting political discrimination against the Communist Party and prohibiting prisoners in the state from reading Communist newspapers and periodicals.

Copies of this letter have been sent to Indian Prime Minister Nehru and Home Minister Pant.

The weekly said that Namboodiripad condemned the Chief Minister of Kerala for actually listing Communist writings as pornographic works and prohibiting prisoners from reading them. He also said, "Not all political views are forbidden from being disseminated among prisoners, but only Communist views are prohibited."

The weekly also said that in the Trivandrum Central Jail in this state, a prisoner named Vasu Pillai is on a hunger strike to protest the deprivation of his right to obtain and read newspapers of his choice. Pillai has been placed in solitary confinement for this, isolated from his fellow inmates. Inmates in the prison, to express their sympathy, have also engaged in a hunger strike. However, they were severely beaten by the prison authorities.

    印共领导人南布迪里巴德
    指责喀拉拉邦政府歧视共产党
    新华社新德里7日电　5月8日出版的“新世纪”周报报道，喀拉拉邦立法会议反对党领袖、印度共产党领袖南布迪里巴德，在给喀拉拉邦首席部长和内政部长的信中指责喀拉拉邦的国大党和人民社会党联合政府肆意对共产党采取政治上的歧视行为，不准这个邦内的被监禁者阅读共产党的报刊。
    这封信的副本已经送给印度总理尼赫鲁和内政部长潘特。
    这家周报说，南布迪里巴德谴责喀拉拉邦首席部长竟把共产党著作列入色情著作，而不准被监禁者阅读。他还说，“并不是一切政治见解都不许在被监禁者中间传播，而唯独不许共产党的见解传播。”
    这家周报还说，在这个邦的特里瓦得琅中央监狱内，一名叫瓦苏·皮莱的被监禁者正在进行绝食，抗议剥夺他获得和阅读他所选择的报纸的权利。皮莱为此已被单独禁闭，同他的难友们隔离。狱中难友们为表示同情，也进行了绝食斗争。但是他们遭到监狱当局的痛打。
