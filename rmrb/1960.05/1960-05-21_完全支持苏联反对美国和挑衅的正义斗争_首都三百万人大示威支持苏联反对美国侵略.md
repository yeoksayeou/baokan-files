Xinhua News Agency, May 20th: Three million two hundred thousand people from all walks of life in the capital held an unprecedentedly grand demonstration and rally today, supporting the Soviet government's solemn stance against the U.S. imperialist crime of aggression, and angrily condemning U.S. imperialism's sabotage of the Four-Power Summit Conference.

Comrade Deng Xiaoping, General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee, solemnly declared on the Tiananmen rostrum today: The entire 650 million Chinese people completely endorse the solemn stance taken by the Soviet Union regarding the Four-Power Government Summit Conference, and fully support the Soviet Union's just struggle against U.S. aggression and provocation. He warned in a strong voice that aggression and provocation against the Soviet Union is aggression and provocation against the People's Republic of China, and aggression and provocation against the entire socialist camp. Every provocation by imperialism against socialist countries and the cause of world peace is bound to be met with redoubled retaliation.

Today, more than 1.2 million people gathered at Tiananmen Square and the East and West Chang'an Avenue venues. From Jianguomen in the east to Fuxingmen in the west, and from Qianmen Zhengyang Bridge in the south, crowds of demonstrators were everywhere. In factories, enterprises, government offices, schools, military units, people's communes in urban and rural areas, and towns in the distant suburbs, more than 2 million people simultaneously held demonstrations and rallies. The vast number of urban and rural people in the city, including workers, peasants, students, militiamen, citizens, and PLA soldiers, have held meetings in recent days to firmly support Comrade Khrushchev's solemn statement at the preparatory meeting of the Four-Power Summit Conference. Today, waving red flags and holding aloft banners and cartoons, they formed countless demonstration teams, issuing powerful roars: "Oppose U.S. imperialism's sabotage of the Four-Power Summit Conference!" "Oppose U.S. imperialism's aggression and provocation against the Soviet Union!" "People of the world, unite, strengthen the struggle, oppose the U.S.-led imperialist war forces, and defend world peace!"

Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, and Lin Biao, Vice Chairmen of the CPC Central Committee; Song Qingling, Vice Chairman of the People's Republic of China; Deng Xiaoping, General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee; Peng Zhen, Chen Yi, Li Fuchun, He Long, and Li Xiannian, members of the Political Bureau; Lu Dingyi and Kang Sheng, alternate members; Wang Jiaxiang, Secretary of the Secretariat; Liu Lantao, alternate secretary; Luo Ruiqing and Xi Zhongxun, Vice Premiers of the State Council; Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, Huang Yanpei, Saifuddin, and Lin Feng, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress; Li Siguang, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC; Fu Zuoyi, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council; Xie Juezai, President of the Supreme People's Court; Liu Ningyi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions; Liu Ren, Second Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CPC, and others, participated in today's conference.

Also participating in today's conference were generals of the Army, Navy, and Air Force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, including General Xu Haidong, General Chen Geng, and General Zhang Yunyi.

Soviet Ambassador to China, Chervonenko, and the embassy's counselors, commercial representatives, and military attachés, Soviet experts, and Soviet comrades visiting Beijing all participated in the conference.

When the party and state leaders, Soviet Ambassador to China Chervonenko, heads of various government departments, generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, heads of various people's organizations and democratic parties, and diplomatic envoys from various countries to China arrived at the Tiananmen rostrum, the square was filled with excitement, and impassioned slogans and thunderous applause resounded through the sky.

At 3:00 p.m., Peng Zhen, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Mayor of Beijing, announced the opening of the Beijing People's Support for the Soviet Union's Just Position and Opposition to U.S. Imperialism's Sabotage of the Four-Power Summit Conference. Ten red balloons, carrying huge slogans, rose from the center of the square.

Deng Xiaoping, General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee, spoke first amidst thunderous applause (full text to be published separately). His speech aroused repeated applause and slogans from the masses in the square.

The demonstrating masses welcomed Soviet Ambassador to China Chervonenko's speech with warm applause. Chervonenko said that the current situation, as well as the actions of the American leaders and President Eisenhower, prove that they are doing their best to undermine improving international relations and exacerbate international tensions; it was they who ruined the summit conference. He said that when imperialism bares its fangs more openly, the people of all countries should be more vigilant, unite their ranks more closely, vigilantly watch and ruthlessly expose the conspiracies of the imperialists and their running dogs—all kinds of revisionists—and be prepared to give the aggressors a resolute and devastating counterattack at any time.

Chervonenko finally shouted: "Long live the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and China, the friendship between the people of the socialist camp countries, and the friendship between the people of all countries in the world!" "Down with the instigators of war, long live world peace!" At this time, thunderous slogans rang out in the venue.

Next to speak was Huang Yanpei. On behalf of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the China Democratic League, the China National Democratic Construction Association, the China Association for Promoting Democracy, the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, the China Zhi Gong Party, the Jiusan Society, and the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, he solemnly declared that the democratic parties of China resolutely support the solemn position of the Soviet government and strongly condemn the crimes of aggression of U.S. imperialism.

Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, said that China and the Soviet Union are strong fortresses for defending world peace. The 650 million Chinese people will forever stand together with the great Soviet people, together with the people of other socialist countries, and together with all peace-loving people in the world, to fight to the end to thoroughly defeat U.S. imperialism's policy of war and aggression and strive for lasting world peace.

Liu Ningyi, representing the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Women's Federation, the Communist Youth League of China, and the All-China Youth Federation, stated in his speech that the Chinese people resolutely support the Soviet government's solemn position in exposing U.S. imperialism's sabotage of the Four-Power Summit Conference. He said that we must thoroughly expose the true face of U.S. imperialism as a robber to the people of the world and make persistent efforts to wage a resolute struggle against imperialism.

When Huang Yanpei, Guo Moruo, and Liu Ningyi spoke, the demonstrating masses continuously issued applause and impassioned slogans. After the speeches, the audience unanimously shouted: "Support the Soviet government's solemn position against the U.S. imperialist crime of aggression!" "Oppose U.S. imperialism's sabotage of the Four-Power Summit Conference!" "Oppose U.S. imperialism's aggression and provocation against the Soviet Union!" "Oppose the U.S. lackey Kishi Nobusuke government's forceful and illegal passage of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty!" "Oppose the U.S. conspiracy to revive West German and Japanese militarism and plot new wars!" "U.S. imperialism, get back to your old home from Asia, Africa, and Latin America!" "Long live the unbreakable friendship and unity between the Chinese and Soviet peoples!" "Long live the great unity of the Socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!" "Long live the great unity of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against imperialism and colonialism!" "Long live the great unity of the people of the world!"
