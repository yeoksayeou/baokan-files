    U.S. After sabotaging the Four-Power Summit, amid the uproar of "anti-Soviet" activities it has launched, is trying its best to stir up war hysteria, conduct armed threats and intimidation, and step up global arms expansion and war preparations. This further exposes the aggressive face of U.S. imperialism as an enemy of the world's people and the cause of peace, and at the same time, it more clearly proves that sabotaging the summit and creating tension are planned steps by the United States.

    Before leaving Paris, Eisenhower, the culprit who sabotaged the summit, even issued an extremely hypocritical statement with the British and French leaders about "not using force or threatening to use force." Then, Herter convened a special meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council, reiterating this statement and trying his best to disguise it. Immediately afterwards, the imperialists and reactionaries, led by the United States, started all their propaganda machines, clamoring that the Soviet Union was creating tension, while portraying themselves as "peace-loving" people. Even the Adenauer group of West German militarists shamelessly said that "Western countries will make unremitting efforts to ease tensions." However, the fact is that it is none other than U.S. imperialism and its accomplices who are trying their best to create a tense atmosphere and stepping up preparations for a new war.

    A few hours before the scheduled start of the summit, the U.S. Department of Defense ordered the U.S. Strategic Air Command and air defense forces to conduct a world-scale "alert exercise." The British Air Force Fighter Command also announced that it was on "alert status." After the United States sabotaged the Four-Power Summit, the U.S., Britain, and Canada held a large-scale joint air force exercise near London. Under the planning of U.S. Chief of Naval Operations Burke, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization naval forces, commanded by West German naval generals, openly held a large-scale naval exercise in the northern Baltic Sea. Not only that, Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Twining clamored, "Our troops are in good, prepared condition, and ready to move out." U.S. Air Force Secretary Sharp also said that the U.S. Air Force stationed in the Far East was "ready." U.S. Strategic Air Command Commander Power even openly clamored that the United States "is both determined and prepared to fight." It's really tense, a truly ferocious posture. May I ask, isn't this the most blatant incitement of a new war to create tension, and what "peaceful methods" of the United States, what "unremitting efforts to ease tensions" of Adenauer? Is it as Macmillan said, that this "new threat and new danger" comes from the Soviet Union, not from the United States and its accomplices?

    The reason why U.S. imperialism is so blatantly inciting a new war and creating a tense situation, in addition to covering up its guilt for sabotaging the summit, is to create the necessary atmosphere for its planned large-scale arms expansion and war preparations. Former U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff Spatz confessed that the U.S. plane intrusion into the Soviet Union was "perhaps unfortunate" in U.S. diplomacy, but "from a military point of view, it is encouraging." This most truly reflects the wishes of the U.S. monopoly groups. The fact is also true. According to a report from United Press International, Eisenhower and the United States' major allies will "intensify their across-the-board defense (referring to arms expansion and war preparations)." The Associated Press also said, "The United States will accelerate efforts to offset the Soviet Union's advantage in the development of rockets and space weapons" and "require other allies to increase their defense budgets." The U.S. House Appropriations Committee immediately passed an additional $73 million for the development of nuclear military aircraft, increasing this expense to over $1 billion. U.S. Secretary of the Army Brucker also announced that the United States would "strengthen" "defense" that "includes the entire world." The United States is stepping up the testing of missiles such as "Atlas" and "Polaris" and is going to resume underground nuclear tests. At the same time, British Defense Minister Watkinson also stated that "Britain will make a very important independent contribution to the West's nuclear deterrent force," and U.S. atomic cannons are about to be transported to Britain. In particular, under the planning of the United States, the West is about to lift some restrictions on West Germany's rearmament. The first step is to allow West Germany to manufacture 6,000-ton destroyers. The Kishi Nobusuke group also forcibly and illegally passed the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty through the Diet. Nixon made no secret of the conspiracy of the U.S. and Japan colluding to carry out expansion and aggression, saying, "Both countries have the strength and will to provide extremely important strength in the vast Pacific region." This shows that the U.S. plan to create new sources of war in West Germany and Japan is accelerating. U.S. imperialism's armed threats and war preparations in the Far East are also becoming more intense. U.S. Secretary of the Army Brucker announced that he would strengthen the U.S. forces invading Korea and strengthen the "prevention" of the so-called "threat from Communist China." The first batch of U.S. F-104 jet fighters was shipped to Taiwan. This is the sinful activity that the U.S. is carrying out behind the "anti-Soviet" clamor.

    The propaganda machines of the U.S. and its accomplices are trying their best to quibble that their accelerated arms expansion and war preparations are the result of some "reassessment of the Soviet Union's policies in the Cold War." This is another extremely shameless excuse! Before the summit, Eisenhower's calls in the State of the Union address and other messages, as well as in various occasions, about "strengthening deterrent power," and the large-scale U.S. arms expansion and war preparations, especially the preparations for developing missiles and establishing missile bases, were they few? Herter's presentation of a ten-year arms expansion plan to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting, the U.S. Supreme Commander of this group, Norstad, announced the imminent establishment of a five-nation nuclear mobile force, and West Germany and Japan's accelerated rearmament, did these just start recently? The Pentagon openly announced that it had formulated operational plans in the Far East and Southeast Asia and would step up preparations for launching local wars in the Far East. U.S. Commander of the Pacific Armed Forces Felt also announced that the troops under his command were "in combat readiness." The United States held the "Blue Star" live ammunition exercise in the South China Sea and launched "Matador" missiles in the Taiwan Strait and South Korea. What is this if not armed threat that has been going on for a long time? The United States has been and is intensely carrying out arms expansion and war preparations. If there is any difference compared with the past, it is only that the United States used to put on a "peaceful" disguise, but now it has changed to the hackneyed tune of anti-Soviet and anti-communist. Now that the past disguise of the United States has been seen through by the people of all countries, can it deceive people today by changing to the banner of anti-Soviet and anti-communist?

    The people of the world have already learned a great lesson from the recent incidents of the United States provoking the Soviet Union and sabotaging the Four-Power Summit, and they have a clearer understanding of the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism. The people of all countries, with their eyes wide open, are more vigilant than ever about the U.S. aggression and war conspiracies. No matter what kind of disguise it is covered with, the accelerated arms expansion and war preparations carried out by the United States will surely be resolutely opposed by the people of the world and will only make the United States fall into a more isolated situation.

    美国在破坏了四国首脑会议之后
    本报评论员
    美国破坏了四国首脑会议之后，正在它所发动的“反苏”的一片喧嚣中，竭力煽动战争歇斯底里，进行武力威胁和恫吓，加紧全球扩军备战活动。这进一步地暴露了美帝国主义与世界人民为敌、与和平事业为敌的侵略面目，同时更加清楚地证明了破坏首脑会议、制造紧张局势是美国有计划的步骤。
    破坏首脑会议的罪魁艾森豪威尔在离巴黎前，居然同英法首脑发表所谓“不使用武力或以武力相威胁”的极端伪善的声明，然后又由赫脱召开了北大西洋集团理事会特别会议，重申这个声明，竭力进行伪装。紧接着，以美国为首的帝国主义和反动派，就开动了一切宣传机器，叫嚷什么苏联制造紧张局势，而把它们自己倒说成是“爱好和平”的人，甚至连西德黩武主义者的阿登纳集团也无耻地说什么“西方国家将以不渝的努力来缓和紧张局势”。然而事实是，竭力制造紧张气氛、加紧准备新战争的不是别人，正是美帝国主义及其帮凶们自己。
    在首脑会议预定开会的时间以前几小时，美国国防部曾下令美国战略空军和防空部队进行世界规模的“戒备演习”。英国空军战斗机动部队也宣布处于“戒备状态”。在美国破坏了四国首脑会议之后，美、英、加拿大在伦敦附近举行了大规模空军联合演习。在美国海军作战参谋长伯克的策划下，西德海军将领指挥的北大西洋集团海军部队，还公然在波罗的海北部举行了大规模的海军演习。不仅如此，美国参谋长联席会议主席特文宁叫嚷，“我们的部队正在良好的、作好准备的情况下，而且准备出动。”美国空军部长夏普也说，美国驻远东空军已经“准备就绪”。美国战略空军司令部司令鲍威尔还公然叫嚣，美国“既有决心而且准备作战”。真是剑拔弩张，好一副凶神恶煞的架势。试问，这难道不是最肆无忌惮的煽动新战争制造紧张局势，而倒是美国的什么“和平方法”、阿登纳的什么“以不渝的努力来缓和紧张局势”吗？这难道是像麦克米伦所说的，这种“新的威胁和新的危险”是来自苏联，而不是来自美国及其帮凶吗？
    美帝国主义所以要如此明目张胆地煽动新战争，制造紧张局势，除了为掩盖它破坏首脑会议的罪责以外，是为它进一步进行大规模扩军备战的预定计划创造必要气氛。美国前空军参谋长斯波茨就供认，美机侵苏事件在美国外交上“可能是不幸的”，但是，“从军事观点来说则是令人鼓舞的”，这就最真实地反映了美国垄断集团的心愿。事实也正是如此。据合众国际社的消息透露，艾森豪威尔和美国的主要盟国将“加紧其全线的防御（即指扩军备战）”。美联社也说，“美国将加速努力以抵消苏联在发展火箭和空间武器方面的优势”，并“要求其他盟国增加它们的防御预算”。美国众议院拨款委员会马上通过了七千三百万美元用于发展核军用飞机的额外费用，使这种费用增加到十亿美元以上。美国陆军部长布鲁克也宣布，美国要“加强”“包括了整个世界”的“国防”。美国加紧进行“阿特拉斯”、“北极星”式等导弹的试验，并要恢复地下核试验。同时，英国国防大臣沃金森也表示，“英国要对西方的核威慑力量作出十分重要的独立贡献”，美国原子大炮即将运到英国。特别是，在美国策划下，西方即将取消对西德重新武装的一些限制，首先一步是允许西德制造六千吨的驱逐舰；岸信介集团也以武力强迫国会非法通过了日美军事同盟条约，尼克松毫不掩饰美日勾结进行扩张侵略的阴谋说，“两国都有力量和意志提供在广大的太平洋地区至为重要的实力。”这表明美国在西德和日本制造新的战争策源地的计划，正在加速进行。美帝国主义在远东的武力威胁和备战活动，也更加紧张起来。美国陆军部长布鲁克宣布要加强侵朝美军，并要加强“防止”所谓“共产党中国的威胁”。美国首批F—104式喷气战斗机运到了台湾。这就是掩盖在“反苏”叫嚣背后美国所进行的罪恶活动。
    美国及其帮凶的宣传机器竭力诡辩说，它们加紧扩军备战是由于什么“重新估计苏联挑起的冷战中的政策”的结果。这又是多末无耻的借口！难道在首脑会议之前，艾森豪威尔在国情咨文和其他咨文以及在各种场合关于“加强威慑力量”的叫嚷，美国大规模进行扩军备战、特别是发展导弹和建立导弹基地方面的备战活动还算少吗？赫脱向北大西洋集团理事会会议提出十年扩军计划，这个集团的美国总司令诺斯塔德宣布即将成立五国核机动部队，西德和日本加紧进行重新武装，这是最近才开始的吗？五角大楼公开宣布已拟订在远东和东南亚的作战计划，并要加紧在远东准备发动局部战争，美国太平洋武装部队总司令费耳特还宣布他统率的部队已
  “处于战斗状态”，美国在中国南海举行
  “蓝星”实弹演习，在台湾海峡和南朝鲜发射“斗牛士”式导弹，这不是早就在进行武力威胁又是什么？美国过去、现在都在紧张地进行扩军备战活动，同过去比起来如果有什么不同的话，仅仅是以前美国披上了“和平”的伪装，而现在则换上了反苏反共的陈腔滥调。既然美国过去的伪装已经被各国人民所识破，那末今天换上反苏反共的幌子难道就能骗得了人吗？
    全世界人民已经从美国最近对苏联进行挑衅和破坏四国首脑会议的事件中得到了很大的教训，对于美帝国主义的侵略本性是看得更清楚了。把眼睛擦得更亮的各国人民比过去更加警惕着美国的侵略和战争阴谋。不管在什么样的幌子掩盖下，美国加紧进行的扩军备战活动必将遭到全世界人民的坚决反对，而只能使得美国陷于更加孤立的境地。
