    Scientists, Assisted by Tibetan People, Explore the Mysteries of Mount Everest
    Scientific Expedition Completed Within Seven Thousand Square Kilometers
    Detailed Reports on Natural Geography, Geology, Geomorphology, Meteorology, Hydrology, Modern Glaciers, Botany, Zoology, and Surveying Have Been Written
    Three Mountaineering Heroes Safely Return to Camps Three and Two
    Xinhua News Agency, May 29th: To uncover the mysteries of the world's highest peak, Mount Everest, the Chinese Mountaineering Association recently organized a scientific expedition team, which conducted the first scientific exploration in this area.
    The expedition team consisted of forty-four scientific and technical personnel from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, Peking University, Nanjing University, Zhongshan University, Lanzhou University, Beijing Institute of Geology, the Ministry of Geology, the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power, the Ministry of Forestry, the State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping, and the Central Meteorological Observatory. The expedition team, led by Captain Luo Zhisheng, and Vice Captains Wang Mingye and Liu Zhaochang, departed from Beijing to Lhasa. After a period of high-altitude acclimatization training and preparation in Lhasa, they began working in the Mount Everest region with good high-altitude living equipment and scientific instruments. During the expedition, it was the rainy season in the Himalayas, with clouds and fog covering the mountains, and rain and snow falling intermittently. Sometimes they rode horses, sometimes they walked, and glaciers and snow slopes on the high mountains were their campsites. Assisted by the local Tibetan people, the expedition members overcame the harsh climate and difficult living conditions, and preliminarily completed scientific surveys in an area of approximately seven thousand square kilometers on the east, west, and north sides of Mount Everest. Their survey content included natural geography, geology, geomorphology, meteorology, hydrology, modern glaciers, botany, zoology, and surveying. They have now written detailed scientific expedition reports according to the above-mentioned specialties.
    Xinhua News Agency, Mount Everest, May 29th: The three Chinese mountaineers who successfully reached the summit of the world's highest peak, Mount Everest, on May 25th, had safely returned to Camp Three at an altitude of 6,400 meters on the north slope of Mount Everest and Camp Two at an altitude of 5,900 meters by the 28th.
    First-class athlete Gonbu (Tibetan) safely returned to the camp at 6,400 meters on the 27th. On the morning of the 28th, he set off to return to Camp Two at 5,900 meters.
    Master sportsmen Wang Fuzhou and Qu Yinhua safely arrived at Camp Three at 6,400 meters from the dangerous North Col (7,007 meters above sea level) ice slope on the afternoon of the 28th. The three of them will return to the base camp at 5,120 meters below the mountain via Camp One at 5,400 meters around the 30th.

    在七千方公里内完成科学考察
    自然地理、地质、地貌、气象、水文、现代冰川、植物、动物，测量等方面的详细报告业已写出
    三名登山英雄平安返回第三第二号营地
    新华社29日讯　为了揭露世界第一高峰——珠穆朗玛峰地区的奥秘，在不久以前，我国登山协会发起组织了一支科学考察队，在这个地区进行了第一次的科学探索。
    这个考察队是由中国科学院、国家体育运动委员会、北京大学、南京大学、中山大学、兰州大学、北京地质学院、地质部、水利电力部、林业部、国家测绘总局、中央气象台等单位的四十四个科学技术工作人员组成的。考察队由队长罗志升、副队长王明业、刘肇昌率领，从北京出发至拉萨，在拉萨进行了一段高山适应性锻炼和准备工作以后，便开始带着良好的高山生活装备和科学器材，进入珠穆朗玛峰地区工作。在考察期间，适逢喜马拉雅山区的雨季，山上云雾弥漫，雨雪交加；他们有时骑马，有时步行，高山上的冰川和雪坡，随处都是他们的宿营地。考察队员们在当地藏族人民的协助下，战胜了恶劣的气候和艰难的生活条件，初步完成了珠穆朗玛峰东西北三面约七千平方公里范围内的科学考察。他们考察的内容包括自然地理、地质、地貌、气象、水文、现代冰川、植物、动物、测量等方面，现在他们已经按上述各专业写出了详细的科学考察报告。
    新华社珠穆朗玛29日电　5月25日胜利地登上世界第一高峰——珠穆朗玛峰顶峰的三名中国登山运动员，到28日为止，已经分别安全返抵珠穆朗玛峰北坡拔海六千四百米的第三号营地和拔海五千九百米的第二号营地。
    一级运动员贡布（藏族）27日就安全地回到了拔海六千四百米的营地。28日上午，他已动身返回拔海五千九百米的第二号营地。
    运动健将王富洲和运动健将屈银华，28日下午从危险的北坳（拔海七千零七米）冰坡安抵拔海六千四百米的第三号营地。他们三人将在30日前后，再经拔海五千四百米的第一号营地回到山下拔海五千一百二十米的大本营。
