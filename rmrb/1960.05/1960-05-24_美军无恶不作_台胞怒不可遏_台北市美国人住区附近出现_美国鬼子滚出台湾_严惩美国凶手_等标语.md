Xinhua News Agency, May 23rd: The atrocities of the American invaders in Taiwan have aroused strong anti-American sentiment among the broad masses of Taiwanese people.

Taiwanese newspapers revealed that on the evening of May 11th, a U.S. Army sergeant stationed in Taiwan broke into the residence of Taiwanese woman Yin Biyun in Taipei City, savagely abducted her to a U.S. military camp, and raped her. After being raped by the American soldier, Yin Biyun cried and ran to the Jingmei branch of the Chiang Kai-shek group's Taipei City Police Department to accuse the U.S. military of the atrocity. However, the Chiang Kai-shek group's police bureau, using the excuse that the U.S. military enjoys "extraterritoriality" in Taiwan, dared not intervene, allowing the American soldier to go scot-free. News of this incident aroused the indignation of Taipei citizens. Slogans such as "Yankee Go Home" and "Severely Punish the American Murderer" appeared near the American residential area in Taipei City. The news said that before this, incidents of women being kidnapped and murdered often occurred in Taiwan, and the perpetrators were often American soldiers. In Kaohsiung, Keelung, and other places, heinous crimes have occurred in which American brutes brutally murdered women after raping them by smashing them to death or throwing them into the sea to eliminate evidence.

Not long ago, a dismemberment case was discovered in Xindian, Taipei. After on-site inspection, it was confirmed that the murderer was an American. The news said that three members of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Taiwan, Nelson and others, hijacked a Taiwanese woman surnamed Zhao in Kaohsiung City onto a U.S. military vehicle and sped away in the dark fog, attempting to abduct the woman to the suburbs for gang rape. However, this U.S. military vehicle crashed into a tree near the Nanzi Bridge in Kaohsiung City, causing the woman to be seriously injured.

U.S. military vehicles speeding recklessly in Taiwan, injuring residents, is even more sinful. According to Taiwanese newspapers, not long ago, the military vehicles of the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group to Taiwan caused three traffic accidents within ten days, killing and injuring four people. One night, three American soldiers, after drinking, stole a sedan car in front of a hotel in Taipei City and sped down the street, first hitting and injuring Zou Xintian, a pedicab worker, and then hitting and injuring Lin Laijia, a roadside noodle vendor, and destroying noodle stalls and bowls. Then, pedestrians Bai Wubo and her daughter Bai Jie were also crushed by the arms and legs of the car driven by these three drunken Americans. This incident aroused great anger among Taipei residents, who demanded that the murderers be arrested and tried.

The news said that the American invading army in Taiwan has committed all kinds of bad deeds. One night, U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group to Taiwan Sergeant Schwiek and Belang of the U.S. Thirteenth Air Force colluded to make trouble, setting off firecrackers indiscriminately in Taipei City, causing firecrackers in a grocery store to burn and explode, damaging glass cabinets, cans, cigarettes, and candies, causing a loss of eight hundred Taiwan dollars. In addition, an American soldier in Tainan City, riding in a pedicab to the entrance of the "Police Bureau" on Wenmiao Road, jumped out of the car and smashed the coffin cover of a family holding a funeral. At this time, passersby surrounded him, preparing to punish this American brute. Seeing that public anger was difficult to defy, this American soldier fled in embarrassment.

The American invaders commit rape, plunder, and act recklessly, causing great resentment among the people in Taiwan. Now, U.S. military personnel stationed in Taiwan dare not walk alone in remote areas, fearing retaliation from the angry Taiwanese people. On May 13th, two American soldiers in Keelung assaulted police officers from the Highway Bureau. Local residents swarmed up to surround the American soldiers who committed the assault and shouted for the perpetrators to be punished. On the eve of the third anniversary of the "May 24th" patriotic anti-American demonstration by the Taiwanese people, American officials stationed in Taiwan were even more panicked, fearing that the Taiwanese people would once again launch an even higher tide of anti-American anger. According to American news agencies, the American invaders have coerced the Chiang Kai-shek group to recently deploy a police network and a large number of secret agents to "prevent any disturbances" around this year's "May 24th," and to threaten Taiwanese newspapers "not to report crimes and other illegal events involving Americans emotionally." The U.S. military stationed in Taiwan has also stepped up its guard recently.

    美军无恶不作　台胞怒不可遏
    台北市美国人住区附近出现“美国鬼子滚出台湾”“严惩美国凶手”等标语
    新华社23日讯　美国侵略者在台湾的暴行，激起了台湾广大人民愤怒的反美情绪。
    台湾报纸透露，5月11日晚上，一个侵台美军上士在台北市闯进台湾妇女殷碧云的住宅，野蛮地把她劫上汽车，装回美军营房强奸。殷碧云被美军强奸后，嚎哭着跑到蒋介石集团台北市警察局景美分驻所控诉美军暴行。但是，蒋介石集团警察局以美军在台湾享有“治外法权”为借口，竟然不敢过问，让美国兵逍遥法外，消息传出后，激起了台北市民的愤慨。台北市美国人住宅区附近出现了“美国鬼子滚出台湾”、“严惩美国凶手”等标语。消息说，在这以前，台湾经常发生妇女被绑架和杀害的事件，凶手常常是美国兵。在高雄、基隆等地，都曾发生美国兽兵凶残地把强奸后的妇女砸死或投入海中，以灭绝罪证的滔天罪行。
    不久以前，在台北新店发现一起分尸案，经过现场查勘，证实凶手是一个美国人。消息说，侵台美国空军人员尼尔生等三人，在高雄市劫持一个姓赵的台湾妇女上美国军车，在黑夜浓雾中驾车飞奔，企图把这个妇女劫往郊外轮奸。但是，这辆美国军车在高雄市楠梓桥附近撞树翻车，致使这个妇女受了重伤。
    美国军用汽车在台湾横冲直撞，伤害居民，更是罪恶万分。据台湾报纸透露，不久前，美国驻台湾军事援助顾问团的军车，在十天内发生三起车祸，辗死撞伤四人。一天夜晚，三个美国兵酒后，在台北市一家酒店门前偷乘一辆小轿车飞奔街头，先撞伤一个名叫邹心田的三轮车工人，又撞伤了街旁面摊小贩林赖加，并撞毁了面橱、面碗，接着，行人白吴波和她的女儿白杰，又被这三个美国酒鬼驾驶的汽车压断了臂膀和腿。这件事引起了台北居民的极大愤怒，纷纷要求捉拿凶手进行审判。
    消息说，在台湾的美国侵略军做尽了各种各样的坏事。一天深夜，美国驻台湾军事援助顾问团军士史威克和美国十三航空队的贝朗，结伙取闹，在台北市区内乱放鞭炮，引起一家杂货店内的鞭炮燃烧爆炸，炸坏了玻璃橱、罐、香烟和糖果，损失台币八百元。另外，一个美国兵在台南市坐着一辆三轮车行至文庙路“警察局”门前，跳下车来把一家正在出葬的人家的棺材罩捣毁，这时过路的行人一齐围上，准备惩罚这个美国兽兵。这个美国兵见众怒难犯，才狼狈逃去。
    美国侵略者奸淫虏掠，胡作非为，引起台湾各地人民的极大愤懑，现在侵台美军人员不敢单独在偏僻地方行走，怕愤怒的台湾人民对他们进行报复。5月13日，在基隆有两个美国兵行凶殴打公路局的警察，当地群众便蜂拥而上将行凶的美国兵团团包围，并高呼惩办凶手。在纪念台湾人民“五·二四”爱国反美大示威三周年前夕，侵台美国官员更是惶恐不安，惧怕台湾人民再次掀起更加高涨的反美怒潮。据美国通讯社透露，美国侵略者已逼挟蒋介石集团最近布下了警察网和大批特务，在今年“五·二四”前后“制止任何骚动”，并且要胁台湾报纸“不要感情用事地报道牵涉美国人的罪行和其他不法事件”。侵台美军最近也加紧戒备。
