Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 5th: A handful of reactionary political parties and right-wing figures in India have been clamoring rampantly for anti-China and anti-communism during and after the meeting between the prime ministers of China and India.

The notorious Bharatiya Jana Sangh recently passed an anti-China resolution at its annual meeting in Delhi, praising Nehru's recent "firm tone" in attacking China. The resolution openly attempts to interfere in China's internal affairs, shouting that there will be no peace on India's northern border unless Tibet is "liberated." It even wants the Indian government to propose "independence" for Tibet. The resolution also clamors for purging so-called "Chinese agents and communists" from state organs.

Praja Socialist Party Member of Parliament, Dwivedi, also praised Nehru for adopting a "firm attitude" towards China during the Lok Sabha debate on the Sino-Indian joint communiqué on April 29th. He said that the meeting between the prime ministers of China and India was an "unnecessary meeting." He believes that the only achievement India gained in the Sino-Indian prime ministers' meeting was "gaining some breathing space." He said that Nehru should continue to adopt "that firm attitude" that he took in the negotiations in the future. He demanded that Nehru rally national strength to deal with China. Dwivedi also opposed Premier Zhou Enlai's proposal that both sides should stop patrolling in the border areas before the border issue is resolved. Kapoor, a member of the Indian National Congress Rajya Sabha, also applauded Nehru's "bold and resolute" attitude in the Sino-Indian prime ministers' meeting.

During the meetings of the Indian Parliament's Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on April 29th to debate the Sino-Indian joint communiqué, some members of the Indian Praja Socialist Party, Bharatiya Jana Sangh, Swatantra Party, and Congress Party clamored in unison, inciting anti-China hysteria. Bharatiya Jana Sangh leader Vajpayee, Praja Socialist Party's Sinha, Democratic Party's Singh, and Democratic Congress Party's Deo opposed the agreement in the Sino-Indian joint communiqué regarding holding talks between officials of the two countries. Singh nonsensically said that holding official-level talks to exchange documents "would only benefit China in consolidating its gains from aggression." Vajpayee frantically clamored for preparing for battle to recover what he called "Indian territory" "occupied by China."

Swatantra Party's Ranga and Praja Socialist Party's Sinha both advocated that India should abandon its non-alignment policy. Ranga shouted that now is the time for India to "abandon its non-alignment policy," that India "should get rid of this dogma," "and tell the world that in the face of Chinese aggression, India can take any approach to defend the country." While slandering China for "burying" the Bandung spirit, he also incited other Asian countries to form an anti-China alliance with India. Praja Socialist Party's Dwivedi also attacked the Communist Party of India in the Lok Sabha as a "fifth column," and his slander was strongly protested by members of the Communist Party of India.

The extreme right-wing leader of the Swatantra Party, Rajagopalachari, slandered the Chinese Premier's statement that both sides should maintain the status quo on the border until the border issue is reasonably resolved as "meaning to solidify the aggression that has already been carried out on Indian territory." He advocated that India should strengthen its ties with Western countries to oppose China and communism, and "unite" the anti-communist forces in Southeast Asian countries on India's side.

The notorious former leader of the Indian Socialist Party, Narayan, rehashed the old tune of "India-Pakistan joint defense against Chinese aggression" at a meeting in Bairani on April 28th. He also advocated abolishing the slogan "Indians and Chinese are brothers."

The chairman of the Delhi State Bharatiya Jana Sangh, Madhok, incited at the annual meeting on April 30th that the talk about Sino-Indian friendship has completely lost its meaning, and the sooner India stops saying this, the better. He frantically clamored for implementing national militarization, and uniting with anti-communist countries in South and Southeast Asia to deal with what he called China's "expansionism." He also brazenly clamored for "liberating Tibet," advocated raising the so-called "Tibetan question" to the United Nations, and demanded recognition of the so-called Tibetan "government-in-exile" composed of Tibetan rebel leaders in India.

    印度反动派猖狂叫嚣反华反共
    公然企图干涉中国内政叫嚷要“解放西藏”
    鼓吹同南亚和东南亚反共国家结成反华联盟
    新华社5日讯　新德里消息：印度一小撮反动政党和右派头目在中印两国总理会谈期间和会谈以后，猖狂地叫嚣反华反共。
    恶名昭著的印度人民同盟最近在德里举行的年会上通过了一项反华决议，赞扬尼赫鲁最近攻击中国的“坚定语气”。决议公然企图干涉中国内政，叫嚷除非西藏得到“解放”，否则印度的北部边境就不会有和平。它竟要印度政府提出西藏“独立”。决议还叫嚣要从国家机关中清洗所谓“中国的代理人和共产党人”。
    人民社会党议员德维卫迪4月29日在人民院辩论中印联合公报时，也称赞尼赫鲁对中国采取“坚定态度”。他说，中印两国总理的会谈是“不必要的会谈”。他认为，印度在中印总理会谈中取得的唯一成就是“获得了某些喘息时间”。他说，尼赫鲁今后应当继续采取他在谈判中所采取的“那种坚定态度”。他要求尼赫鲁纠集全国力量来对付中国。德维卫迪还反对周恩来总理提出的在边界问题未解决以前双方应当停止在边境地区巡逻的主张。印度国大党联邦院议员卡普尔也为尼赫鲁在中印总理会谈中采取“大胆而坚决的”态度叫好。
    在印度国会人民院和联邦院4月29日举行会议辩论中印联合公报时，印度人民社会党、人民同盟、自由党和国大党的一些议员们齐声聒噪，煽动反华歇斯底里。印度人民同盟首领巴志帕伊、人民社会党的辛哈、民主党的辛格和民主大会党的德奥反对中印联合公报中关于两国官员举行会谈的协议。辛格胡说什么举行官员级的会谈来交换文件一事“只会有利于中国巩固它的侵略所得”。巴志帕伊疯狂地叫嚣说，要进行战斗准备，以收复他所谓的“中国占领”的“印度领土”。
    自由党的兰加和人民社会党的辛哈都主张印度应该放弃不结盟的政策。兰加大叫，现在是印度“放弃不结盟政策的时候了”，印度“应当摆脱这个教条”，“并且向全世界说，在面临中国侵略的情况下，印度可以采取任何方针来保卫国家”。他一面污蔑中国“埋葬”了万隆精神，一面还煽动其他亚洲国家跟印度结成反华联盟。人民社会党德维卫迪在人民院还攻击印度共产党是“第五纵队”，他的诬蔑遭到印度共产党的议员强烈的抗议。
    极右翼的自由党领袖拉贾戈帕拉查里诬蔑中国总理关于两国边界问题获得合理解决前双方维持边界现状的话是“意味着要把已经在印度领土上进行的侵略固定下来”。他鼓吹印度要加强同西方国家的联系来反华反共，并把东南亚国家的反共力量“团结”在印度方面。
    臭名远扬的印度前社会党头子纳拉扬4月28日在拜拉尼的一个会议上，重弹“印巴联防抵抗中国侵略”的滥调，他还主张废除“印中人民是兄弟”的口号。
    德里邦的人民同盟主席马多克4月30日在年会上煽动说，关于中印友谊的谈论已经完全失去意义，愈早停止这种说法对印度愈好。他疯狂地叫嚣要实行全国军事化，并同南亚和东南亚的反共国家联合起来对付他所谓的中国的“扩张主义”。他还悍然叫嚷要“解放西藏”，鼓吹向联合国提出所谓“西藏问题”，要求承认在印度的西藏叛乱头目们组成的所谓西藏“流亡政府”。
