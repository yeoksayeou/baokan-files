Chairman Mao's Concern for the Cultural Education of Guards
Jiefangjun Bao Reporter

(I)
Unit One of a certain guard unit, under the cordial guidance and meticulous care of the great leader Chairman Mao, is advancing rapidly along the glorious road of intellectualizing the worker-peasant masses. Recently, they were selected as an advanced collective to attend the People's Liberation Army Cultural Education Activists Representative Conference. Speaking of Chairman Mao's concern for the cultural education of the guards, let's start with the story of the team members meeting the great leader.

On a warm, breezy afternoon in May 1955, our beloved leader Chairman Mao took time out of his busy schedule to meet with all the comrades of Unit One. What a glorious and happy moment that was! The team members put on their brand-new uniforms and lined up in an ordinary courtyard in Zhongnanhai. As soon as they stood at attention, Chairman Mao came out of the house across the way. Chairman, with a benevolent smile, walked to the front of the line and asked the team members their names, immediately enlivening the atmosphere in the courtyard.

"What is the purpose of our work?" Chairman, with kind eyes, looked from the head of the line to the end. Someone in the line immediately replied: "For communism!" "To serve the people!" Chairman nodded with satisfaction, invited everyone to sit down, and then sat on a rattan chair, chatting as if at home, from the founding and development of the Chinese Communist Party to the victory of the Chinese revolution and the magnificent picture of China's socialist industrialization. Then he talked about how everyone should work, how to learn, and how to connect with the masses. Chairman especially exhorted everyone to study culture well.

Everyone listened attentively, wanting to write down Chairman's valuable teachings in their notebooks word for word. But alas, many people didn't know how to take notes, and the pens in their hands were not cooperating.

Finally, Chairman said again in a consultative tone: "You are all engaged in guard work, and now I will add the task of studying culture for you, do you agree?"

Everyone answered in unison: "We agree!"

Nearly an hour passed. Chairman stood up from the rattan chair with a smile and waved to everyone repeatedly. The unforgettable meeting ended like this.

In mid-July, when Chairman heard that some team members from Unit One had returned from visiting their families, he asked them to write some written materials reporting on the situation in their hometowns. During those days, Chairman also took precious time from his office hours to invite several comrades to talk to him about the situation in their hometowns and carefully read the written materials they had written.

Guard Wang Wenli wrote materials after returning home, but he didn't write them well even after six attempts. In the end, he had to hand over the materials full of typos to the Chairman with embarrassment. Chairman casually picked up a pencil and drew black lines on the materials in front of him, correcting the typos, while saying: "The '酬' (chóu) character in '报酬' (bàochou - reward) is written like this, this is the '仇' (chóu) character in '仇恨' (chóuhèn - hatred)." After finishing the corrections, Chairman encouraged him and said: "This is the first time, the materials are not bad."

Gao Bichen's pocket had been carrying a material he wrote after returning from visiting his family for several days, and now this material was crumpled and unrecognizable. As soon as he reached out to touch his pocket, Chairman said with a smile: "Let me see." Gao Bichen slowly took out the written material and handed it to the Chairman with both hands. He thought, the characters on the material were written crookedly, and there were many typos, would Chairman be able to read it clearly? Don't delay his time. But Chairman patiently corrected the typos on the material word by word, and even added the missing punctuation marks with a pencil.

The weather was so hot at that time, Chairman and everyone sat under the pergola, sweating through their shirts, but he still concentrated on reading the materials. When Chairman saw in the material that a cooperative cadre from a poor peasant background was so weak from illness, but still insisted on getting up early and working late, leading the masses to engage in production, Chairman looked up and pondered for a while, and said with a tone of admiration: "Hmm, such a good comrade! In a few days, you write a letter to ask if he has recovered from his illness, and go see him again when you go home next time." Finally, Chairman wrote the following comment on Gao Bichen's material: "This report is well written, with analysis and examples." Now this material has become a precious exhibit in the Chinese People's Revolution Military Museum.

When the small Zeng Wen handed the materials to Chairman, he was so nervous that he couldn't speak clearly. He was from Guangdong, and Chairman asked him to say a few words in "Hakka" before saying: "Your characters are written very well. Did you write this yourself?" Zeng Wen shook his head and said: "No, someone else copied it for me." Chairman said: "No need to copy, the original is very good." Then he read his material for a while and asked:

"Is the drought there so severe?"

Zeng Wen said: "Yes, my hometown is full of dry rivers and cracked land. This is a drought that hasn't been seen in a hundred years."

Chairman turned around and asked: "Has it rained since you went back?"

When Zeng Wen told the Chairman that it happened to rain heavily for four or five days after he went back, the Chairman let out a sigh of relief. Later, Chairman saw from the materials that the people in the disaster area relied on the strength of the cooperative to achieve victory in the drought resistance, and praised: "The people there are so brave, the agricultural production cooperative should play such a role." He immediately picked up a pencil and wrote a four-character comment on Zeng Wen's material: "合作社好" (Hézuòshè hǎo) - "The cooperative is good."

During the conversation, Chairman learned that the team members only had one day of cultural lessons a week, so he said to the captain: "Give them more cultural and scientific knowledge, learn some geography, history, mathematics, physics, and chemistry, and reach high school graduation in three to five years."

Chairman understood so deeply the difficulties everyone had due to a lack of culture! Wang Wenli, with a broad forehead, had been begging with his parents year after year since he could remember, and had been sheltering in Guandi Temple year after year. The only bit of culture he had was learned since joining the army. As for Gao Bichen, he had been a bamboo craftsman since he was a child, and he had only attended school for a few days at home, and he couldn't remember all the commonly used characters. And Zeng Wen, who asked someone to copy his materials, was a cowherd who was sold into servitude as a child, how could he have the opportunity to go to school! He also wrote materials to the Chairman for the first time based on the little bit of culture he had learned after joining the army. …

In the middle of correcting their materials, Chairman tirelessly instructed them: "You are all good comrades, but your culture is a bit low. You should improve your culture, so that you can master scientific knowledge and do more work for the people and serve the people more. … Our cause needs a large number of intellectuals from worker and peasant backgrounds."

After listening, the team members said in their hearts: Thank you, great Chairman Mao! We are determined to repay you with excellent academic achievements!

(II)
From 1956, after a period of intensive cultural study in Unit One, all team members finally reached the level of graduating from elementary school in both Chinese and arithmetic. However, everyone knew that this was still far from meeting the needs of the revolutionary cause. For example, when military lessons talked about anti-atomic and anti-chemical warfare, as well as ballistics, everyone found it very difficult to understand. None of them had studied physics or chemistry!

At that time, our beloved Chairman Mao often inquired about the team members' cultural studies and often asked some of the most common scientific questions to stimulate the team members' desire for knowledge. From the north to the south, from the Bohai Bay to the Pearl River, Chairman asked wherever he went; from the clouds in the sky to the water on the ground, from the birds in the air to the flowers and trees in the yard, Chairman asked about everything he saw. Several times, when Chairman was swimming, he asked: "Zeng Wen! Do you know what the composition of water is?" "Wang Hui! Why can a person float on the water?"

"Gao Bichen, why is seawater salty?" These swimming champions who had accompanied the Chairman across the Yangtze River and swam in the ocean with the Chairman were all stumped by the Chairman. At this time, Chairman would encourage them and say: "Why do you only study Chinese and arithmetic! You should learn more cultural and scientific knowledge."

During a stroll, Chairman also said to Sun Lianzhong: "Why is Guangzhou so hot? What good is the hot weather?"

The astute Sun Lianzhong, who was also born to hard labor and had not attended school at home, could only vaguely say: "The hot weather is good." Chairman smiled and said: "Have you studied geography?" Sun Lianzhong replied: "No." Chairman told him: "Guangzhou is the best place in China, with three harvests a year. Look at the geography, our country is very big!…"

The autumn in Beijing is cool. On this day, Gao Bichen was accompanying Chairman swimming. Suddenly, clusters of dark clouds flew in the blue sky, and suddenly the wind and waves roared, and flocks of crows flew around, looking like it was about to rain. At this time, only a few strong eagles flew steadily high above the dark clouds without shaking their bodies or moving their wings. Chairman looked up and asked Gao Bichen: "Why can eagles fly in the clouds without moving their wings?" Gao Bichen stammered and couldn't answer. Chairman continued: "You must study physics well in the future!"

Guard team members Gao Bichen, Zeng Wen, Sun Lianzhong and other comrades still can't hold back the excitement in their hearts when talking about these past events. It was precisely because of the Chairman's constant guidance and tireless teaching that their desire to learn culture became more and more urgent, and their enthusiasm for learning culture became more and more vigorous. Everyone was secretly determined: they would let Chairman Mao down if they didn't study culture well, and they would also let Chairman Mao down if they didn't study culture well.

On September 15, 1956, it was the opening day of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China. That morning, Zeng Wen met Chairman Mao as soon as he got up. Chairman kindly called out his name and talked to him about the cultural studies of Unit One.

"...In the future, you don't have to call it a team, just call it a cultural school, and you will be called students." Chairman paused and asked: "Is it okay for me to be your principal?" Zeng Wen happily said repeatedly: "Okay!" Chairman smiled and said: "I will be the honorary principal, and then invite a vice principal. You will study here for seven or eight years to reach high school graduation or college graduation level, what do you say?"

"It will work!" Zeng Wen replied to Chairman with confidence.

Chairman said again: "You are still very young, only in your twenties, I think it is possible. Comrade Zhang Baojin, who used to follow me, used to herd cattle for others and worked as a hired worker and had never studied. He went to Renmin University to study and even got first place." Zeng Wen told Chairman: "Now the comrades have a great enthusiasm for learning culture." Chairman nodded and said: "You will become college students from worker and peasant backgrounds after studying in this school for seven or eight years. There are still very few college students from worker and peasant backgrounds now, but there will be more in the future."

Following these cordial teachings of the leader, the Party Committee of the guard unit quickly formulated an educational plan for the junior high school stage for Unit One and sent it to Chairman for approval. The next day, Chairman approved the plan. After some necessary teaching preparation work and organizational work, on January 21, 1957, the cultural school of Unit One officially opened.

After school started, Chairman always constantly cared about their studies. For some comrades who were out on duty, Chairman often asked them: "Are you tired from work? Have you brought all the things you learned?"

During a winter trip in 1957, the plane was about to take off, and Chairman was still learning about the cultural studies from Sun Lianzhong, who was traveling with him. At that time, Sun Lianzhong and the others had already begun to study physics and algebra. Chairman asked him if it was easy to learn. Sun Lianzhong said: "Physics is easy to learn, it is all about what we have done ourselves and what we have seen with our own eyes, and it is easy to remember, but algebra is not easy to learn."

Chairman said gently: "Algebra must be learned well! Many calculations in physics and chemistry are done with algebra. If you don't learn algebra well, you won't be able to learn physics and chemistry well. Don't be afraid of difficulties!"

Sun Lianzhong replied happily to Chairman: "We are not afraid of difficulties, we will definitely study hard!"

(III)
The Great Leap Forward of 1958 was also a year of Great Leap Forward in cultural studies for Unit One. At that time, the team members had generally developed the habit of writing diaries and a good atmosphere of reading and learning. The team members who returned from visiting their families were already able to write written materials with neat characters and fluent sentences. Some team members also published poems and prose in newspapers and periodicals. The team members' interest in learning was also much wider. People's Daily, Liberation Army Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and "August 1st" Magazine were newspapers and periodicals that each team subscribed to, and each person had a set of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong"; articles such as "On Contradiction", "On Practice", and "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society" had been read by the team members many times and discussed collectively many times, and many people had also written study心得 (xīndé - insights/reflections).

With the continuous progress and improvement of the team members in thought and culture, Chairman also put forward higher requirements for them.

On July 28, 1958, after Chairman visited a certain tool lathe exhibition hall, he said to the team members who accompanied him: "How did you feel about visiting those machines today?"

The team member replied: "Very good! But I don't understand their structural principles."

Chairman said: "Yes, cadres from peasant backgrounds generally lack knowledge in this area. I think your unit can set up a factory. … You should increase your work by two hours every day, and in addition to standing guard, you should study for four hours and work as workers for four hours. You are cadres, students, and workers. After four years, you will become cadres who are proficient in both writing and martial arts, what do you think?"

The team member happily replied to Chairman: "Very good! When we discussed the general line this time, a teacher put forward a suggestion to set up a factory and plant experimental fields."

Chairman said: "This teacher has foresight. In the future, cadres without a little production knowledge will not be able to do. …"

One day in mid-August, Chairman had just done his fitness exercise and said to team member Gao Bichen: "Did you go home this year?" Gao Bichen replied: "I went home once in May."

Chairman asked: "How many days did you stay at home? Did you participate in labor?" Gao Bichen said: "I stayed at home for seven days and participated in labor for four days." Chairman continued:

"That's good! This is also a kind of learning, this is a labor lesson. You have only taken cultural lessons now, and you have not taken labor lessons. Other schools are running factories and doing experiments, you go back and discuss it with your leaders, I think your unit can set up a factory. …"

Not many days later, during the Beidaihe Conference held by the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Unit One followed the instructions of the leader and started a hydrochloric acid factory from scratch. Everyone used their spare time to pick up waste bricks, dig pits in the ground, build stoves, set up pots, and transported salt brine from the local products company. After working hard for several days, they finally produced hydrochloric acid.

At that time, they were learning chemistry. The teacher also drew a diagram and specifically explained to the team members: how to build a hydrochloric acid factory? Why can salt brine turn into hydrochloric acid? A table was also made, and the team members were divided into two-person teams, with each team working day and night, taking turns interning to produce hydrochloric acid. They produced hydrochloric acid with their own hands, increasing their knowledge of running industry. This combines learning with production practice.

At that time, Unit One also sent people to the Zhongnanhai Steel Plant every day to participate in steelmaking. They plastered the furnace, smashed iron, and carried molten steel; they also brought chemistry textbooks and took large classes in front of the converter, learning about the chemical reaction of iron turning into steel. Through steelmaking, they became familiar with what is called ferrous oxide, ferric oxide, and what is the composition of steel.

Team member Yang Shutian has mastered steelmaking technology. With his dark face, wearing a fireproof hat and colored protective glasses, standing in front of the steelmaking furnace, more than a dozen team members who came to participate in steelmaking were all holding chemistry textbooks, listening to his lectures in the deafening roar of the blower. Yang Shutian lectured while directing operations, … one furnace of steel, one lesson, in eleven or twelve minutes.

This afternoon, the beloved leader Chairman Mao personally came to see the team members making steel. Chairman shook hands with the team members one by one, looked at the steelmaking furnace, and looked at the iron-making furnace. Chairman, watching the team members become steelworkers, spoke while smiling, praising them: "You are doing the right thing!" He also said to the team members: "You are doing well!"

That night, the team members put forward the slogan: We are determined to produce two tons of steel to repay Chairman Mao's concern! Guo Changqing accidentally scalded his foot with molten steel, but he still insisted on carrying a steel ladle all night. Jiang Baohai hadn't had a good rest for two days and two nights, but he still insisted on working all night. Look, the guard team members are wearing work clothes that have been burned into flowery spots by the steel flowers, with glorious burns and smoke marks on their hands and faces, guarding the Zhongnanhai position of the whole people seizing steel. They are soldiers, students, and workers. …

(IV)
Day after day, year after year, the team members of Unit One have not only been persistently and diligently engaged in cultural studies under the direct teaching and cordial care of the leader, but also under the inspiration of the leader's selfless working spirit and tireless learning spirit. They have seen with their own eyes that our great leader is so old and so knowledgeable, but he often works and studies day and night. They have received so much deep education from the Chairman and absorbed so much huge spiritual strength!

From the scorching summer nights to the snowy winter days, the desk lamp in Chairman's room was always so bright all night long. Our beloved leader is often working tirelessly on national affairs in this way without sleep or rest. Often in the quiet of the night, the young team members stand on the glorious sentry post, watching this bright desk lamp, and silently say in their hearts: Beloved Chairman, you are tired, you should take a rest! But Chairman always sits at his desk very energetically, carefully reading documents and writing things; only when he is too tired does he stand up and walk around to stretch his body, and then sit down to continue working.

Beloved Chairman, in addition to his tense work, also seizes every opportunity to read, read newspapers and magazines, and read various books from ancient and modern times, both Chinese and foreign. What is particularly moving to the team members is that Chairman is so old, but he still studies foreign languages every day, and reads foreign languages aloud under the street lights at twelve o'clock on summer nights. As soon as the team members think of Chairman reading foreign languages, they immediately recite those difficult-to-remember mathematical symbols and chemical equations repeatedly, firmly remembering them in their hearts.

Beloved leader, every year he takes a lot of time to go out and inspect work. His luggage can be easily lifted by the team members who accompany him, but the books and documents he brings are box after box. Even on ships, on trains, and even on airplanes at high altitudes, Chairman is always reading documents, reading books, and learning foreign languages; Chairman's seat is always piled up with various newspapers and books. As long as they see the Chairman studying during the journey, the team members who accompany him will seize the time to make up lessons and resolutely keep up with the learning progress of the comrades at home.

In this way, no matter when and where, as long as the guard team members think of how the Chairman is working and studying, they will forget the difficulties they encounter in learning and devote all their energy to cultural studies.

Is this possible? Wang Wenli, who originally couldn't even write a report on visiting his family and had the lowest level of arithmetic, was actually able to become a learning model for the guard team in the first year of junior high school. At the same time, starting from the second academic year, he was also able to tutor comrades with lower levels and those who returned from business trips in algebra, geometry, and chemistry. People say he has changed a lot, and he also feels that he has become unusually changed.

Sun Lianzhong, Gao Bichen, and others once accompanied the Chairman on a trip for more than sixty days at a stretch. It is said that with so many missed classes, their cultural studies would inevitably fall behind. But after they turned around, not only was the progress of their various subjects the same as at home, but they also did more than forty more geometry exercises than their comrades at home.

During a trip last summer, Chairman sat by the car window, watching the rolling golden rice fields along the railway line. When Gao Bichen passed by Chairman, Chairman said to him: "This rice field is so good!" Then he asked about their cultural studies. Chairman said:

"Do you have time to study when you are out?"

Gao Bichen replied: "We also study on the train now, and we can study for two hours every day."

Chairman said: "Which courses have you studied now? Which courses have not been completed?"

Gao Bichen replied: "History, geography, Chinese, algebra, physics, and chemistry have all been completed, and only half of geometry has not been completed."

Later one day, when Chairman learned that Sun Lianzhong was not only responsible for organizing the cultural studies of the team members who accompanied him, but also could teach algebra to new comrades, he smiled and said:

"You have all become literati now."

Chairman's words are the highest reward for all team members. Yes, these outstanding children of workers and peasants from all over the country, in recent years, under the cordial guidance of the Chairman, have taken a big step on the road to intellectualizing the worker-peasant masses. In August 1959, they had completed the junior high school curriculum. After graduating from junior high school, some of them have become instructors, platoon leaders, and teachers in the guard unit, and some have been sent to Party schools and military schools for further study. But their cultural studies have not been interrupted. In October this year, the team members who are still working in Unit One will enter the study of higher education courses. These people who were tormented and deprived of the right to live and study in the old society, who would have dreamed of such a happy today! Year after year, the leader's great mind warms them and nurtures them, making them grow up quickly. When we think that these outstanding children of workers and peasants are representing the People's Liberation Army and faithfully fulfilling the entrustment of the 600 million people of the motherland to guard our great leader, we will immediately feel that the beloved leader's concern for these guard soldiers is also a concern for all the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and for the 600 million working people of our country. Let us move forward with full of love and gratitude to the great leader, and strive to realize the cultural revolution in our country as soon as possible! (Attached picture)

    毛主席关怀警卫战士学文化
    解放军报记者
    （一）
    警卫部队某部一中队，在伟大领袖毛主席的亲切教导和无微不至的关怀下，沿着工农群众知识化的光辉道路，飞速前进着，最近，他们已经被选为出席解放军文化教育积极分子代表大会的先进集体。提起毛主席关怀警卫战士学文化，我们还是从一中队的队员们会见伟大领袖的故事说起吧。
    1955年5月一个暖风拂拂的下午，敬爱的领袖毛主席在繁忙的工作中抽出时间，接见了一中队的全体同志。那是多么光荣、多么幸福的时刻！队员们换上崭新的军装，列队来到中南海一所普通的院子里。刚刚站好队，毛主席就从对面的屋子里出来了。主席带着慈祥的笑容走到队列前面，询问队员的名字，院子里的空气马上活跃起来。
      “我们工作是为什么目的呢？”主席闪着和悦的目光，从排头向排尾看了一眼。队列里立刻有人答道：“为共产主义！”“为人民服务！”主席满意地点了点头，招呼大家坐下，然后坐在藤椅上，就像拉家常一样，从中国共产党的创立和发展，一直讲到中国革命的胜利，以及中国社会主义工业化的壮丽图景。以后又讲到每个人应该怎样工作，怎样学习，怎样联系群众。主席特别谆谆教导大家要好好学文化。
    大家聚精会神地听着，真想把主席的这些宝贵的教导，一字不漏地在小本子上记下来。可是呀，好多人都不会作笔记，手中的笔不听使唤。
    最后，主席又用商量的口气说：“你们都搞警卫工作，现在再给你们加一个学习文化的任务，你们同意不同意？”
    大家齐声答道：“同意！”
    将近一个小时过去了。主席笑着从藤椅上站起来，向大家连连挥手，难忘的会见就这样结束了。
    7月中旬，主席听说一中队有些队员探家回来了，他就让他们写些书面材料，报告家乡的情况。那些日子，主席还曾经抽出珍贵的办公时间，请了几个同志到他那里谈谈家乡情况，并且仔细地阅读了他们所写的书面材料。
    警卫队员王文礼，探家回来写材料，一连写了六次还没写好。最后只好带着满纸的错别字，难为情地把材料交给主席。主席随手拿起铅笔，当着他的面在材料上画黑杠，改错字，一面改一面说：“报酬的‘酬’字是这样写，这是仇恨的‘仇’字。”改完了，主席鼓励他说：“这是头一次，材料写得还不坏嘛。”
    高碧岑的口袋里，几天以前就装好了一份探家回来写的材料，现在这份材料已经揉得不像样了。他刚伸手摸了摸口袋，主席就笑着说：“给我看看。”高碧岑才慢慢腾腾地把写好的材料掏出来，双手递给主席。他本想，材料上的字写得歪七倒八，错别字也很多，主席能看清吗？可别耽误了他的时间。那知主席又是那样耐心地一字一句地修改着材料上的错别字，连漏掉的标点符号也用铅笔给添上了。
    当时天气是那样热，主席和大家坐在凉棚下，热得衬衫都湿透了，可是他还是聚精会神地看材料。当主席看到材料上写着：有个贫农出身的合作社干部，病得浑身无力，但是还坚持着起早贪黑，带领着群众搞生产，主席便仰起脸沉思了一会，用赞叹的口气说：“嗯，这样好的同志！过些日子，你写封信问问他的病好了没有，下次回家你再去看看他。”最后，主席在高碧岑的材料上写下这样一句批语：“此份报告写得不错，有分析，有例证。”现在这份材料已经变成中国人民革命军事博物馆里面的一件珍贵的展览品。
    小个子曾文把材料交给主席的时候，紧张得话都说不清楚。他是广东人，主席叫他说了几句“客家”话，才说：“你的字写得很好。这是你自己写的吗？”曾文摇摇头说：“不是，别人给抄了一下。”主席说：“不用抄，原样就很好。”接着把他的材料读了一会，就问：
    “你们那里的旱灾这么严重？”
    曾文说：“是呀，我们家乡到处是河干地裂，这是百年来没有过的大旱”。
    主席转过头来问：“你回去以后雨还没有下吗？”
    当曾文告诉主席，他回去以后的四五天正好下了一场大雨，主席才“啊”的一声舒了口气。后来，主席从材料上看到灾区人民依靠合作社的力量，在抗旱中取得了胜利，就连口称赞道：“你们那里的老百姓真勇敢，农业生产合作社是应该起到这样的作用。”马上拿起铅笔，在曾文的材料上写下四个字的批语：“合作社好。”
    在谈话中间，主席了解到队员们一星期只上一天文化课，便向队长说：“要多给他们学一点文化科学知识，学一些地理、历史、数学、物理、化学，三五年达到中学毕业。”
    主席是多么深切地了解大家缺少文化的难处啊！额头宽宽的王文礼，从打记事以来，就年年月月跟着父母讨饭吃，年年月月在关帝庙里安身，仅有的这点点文化，还是参军以来学习的。高碧岑呢，他从小当篾工，总算在家里念过几天书，常用字也记不全。还有托人抄材料的曾文，幼年时候就是卖身的放牛娃，哪里有可能上学呢！他也是凭着参军后学到的一点点文化，第一次写材料给主席看的。……
    主席在给他们修改材料的中间，还娓娓不倦地嘱咐他们说：“你们都是好同志，就是文化低一些，你们好好把文化提高一下，以后就能够掌握科学知识，多为人民作点工作，多为人民服务。……我们的事业需要大批的工农出身的知识分子。”
    队员们听了，都在心里说：感谢您，伟大的毛主席！我们决心用优良的学习成绩来报答您！（二）
    从1956年开始，一中队经过一段时间的文化学习突击以后，全体队员的语文和算术两门课，总算都达到了高小毕业的程度。但是，大伙也都知道，这和革命事业的需要比起来，还有很远的距离。比方说，上军事课时讲到什么防原子、防化学，还有什么射击学理，大家听起来就很吃力。谁也没有学过物理、化学呀！
    那时候，敬爱的毛主席常常询问队员们文化学习的情况，还常常提问一些最普通的科学知识，启发队员们求知的欲望。从北方到南方、从渤海湾到珠江，主席是走到哪里，问到哪里；从天上的云到地上的水，从空中的飞鸟到院子里的花木，主席是见到什么就问什么。有几次，主席在游泳的时候，就问道：“曾文！你知道水的成分是什么？”“王惠！人在水上为什么会浮起来？”
  “高碧岑，你说海水为什么是咸的？”这些曾经陪同主席横渡长江，而又陪主席同游大海的游泳猛将，一时都被主席问住了。这时候，主席便会激励他们说：“为什么你们只学语文、算术两门课！要多学一点文化科学知识嘛。”
    在一次漫步的时候，主席还向孙连忠说：“广州为什么这样热？你说天热有什么好处？”
    精明的孙连忠，也是扛活出身，在家没念过书，只好含糊其词地说：“天热就好呗。”主席笑着说：“你学过地理没有？”孙连忠回答：“没有。”主席便告诉他说：“广州这地方是中国最好的地方，庄稼一年三收。你看看地理吧，咱们国家大得很！……”
    北京的秋天是凉爽的。这一天，高碧岑正陪着主席游泳，蓝蓝的天空里忽然飞来一团团乌云，顿时风吹浪响，成群的乌鸦乱飞，眼看就要下雨的样子。这时候，只有几只雄健的老鹰，身不摇，翅不动，在乌云上面平稳高飞。主席仰着身子问高碧岑道：“你说老鹰在云中为什么翅膀不动可以飞？”高碧岑张口结舌答不上来，主席接着说：“你们以后可要好好学习物理啊！”
    警卫队员高碧岑、曾文、孙连忠等同志，至今谈起这些往事来，还按捺不住心头的激动。正是由于主席随时随地的诱导和不倦地教诲，他们学习文化的要求才越来越迫切，学习文化的热情也越来越旺盛。大家都在暗下决心：不好好学习文化对不起毛主席，学不好文化也对不起毛主席。
    1956年9月15日，正是中国共产党第八次全国代表大会开幕的日子。这天早上，曾文刚起床就遇到了毛主席。主席亲切地喊了声他的名字，便和他谈起了一中队的文化学习。
    “……以后你们就不要叫什么队了，就叫文化学校吧，你们就叫学员。”主席停了一下，问：“我当你们的校长好吗？”曾文高兴得连声说：“好！”主席笑了笑说：“我当名誉校长，再请一个副校长。你们在这里学习七、八年，达到高中毕业或者大学毕业程度，你说成不成？”
    “成！”曾文信心十足地回答主席。
    主席又说：“你们还很年轻，才二十多岁，我看是可以的。过去跟我的张宝金同志，以前给人家放牛，当雇工，没有读过书，他到人民大学读书，还考第一名。”曾文告诉主席：“现在同志们学习文化的劲头都很大。”主席点了点头，说：“你们在这个学校学习七、八年，就成了工农出身的大学生，现在工农出身的大学生还很少，将来就多了。”
    遵循着领袖的这些亲切的教导，警卫部队的党委很快地为一中队制订了一个初中阶段的教育计划，送请主席批示，第二天主席就批准了这个计划。经过一番必要的教学准备工作和组织工作，1957年1月21日，一中队的文化学校正式开学了。
    开学之后，主席总是经常不断地关心他们的学习。对一些外出执勤的同志，主席常问他们：“你们工作累不累？你们把学习的东西都带来了吗？”
    1957年一次冬季的旅途中，飞机已经快要起飞了，主席还在向随行的孙连忠了解文化学习情况。当时，孙连忠他们已经开始学习物理和代数。主席问他好学不好学，孙连忠说：“物理好学，讲的都是亲身作的和眼睛看到的，也好记，就是代数不好学。”
    主席温和地说：“代数一定得学好！物理、化学好多计算都是用代数计算的，你们要学不好代数，物理、化学也学不好。不要怕难！”
    孙连忠愉快地回答主席说：“我们不怕难，一定好好学！”（三）
    大跃进的1958年，也正是一中队文化学习大跃进的一年。那时候，队员们已经普遍地养成了写日记的习惯和读书好学的风气。探家回来的队员，已经能写出字体工整、文句流畅的书面材料。有些队员还在报刊上发表了诗歌、散文。队员们学习的兴趣也广泛多了。人民日报、解放军报、红旗杂志、“八一”杂志是各分队必订的报刊，“毛泽东选集”人手一套；“矛盾论”、“实践论”、“中国社会各阶级的分析”等文章，队员们每人阅读过好多次，集体讨论过好多次，许多人还写出了学习心得。
    随着队员们思想上、文化上不断地进步和提高，主席对他们也就提出了更高的要求。
    1958年7月28日，主席参观某工具车床展览馆回来，向随行的队员说：“今天你参观那些机器觉得怎样？”
    队员回答说：“很好！可是不懂得它们的构造原理。”
    主席说：“是啊，一般农民出身的干部都缺乏这方面的知识。我看你们单位可以办一个工厂。……你们每天应该增加两小时工作，除站哨以外，四小时学习，四小时当工人。你们是干部，是学生，又是工人。四年以后，成为文武双全的干部，你看怎样？”
    这位队员高兴地回答主席说：“很好！我们这次讨论总路线的时候，有位教员提出了个建议，要办工厂和种试验田。”
    主席说：“这个教员有远见。今后的干部，没有一点生产知识是不行的。……”
    8月中旬的一天，主席刚刚作过健身运动，便向队员高碧岑说：“你今年回家没有？”高碧岑答道：“5月间回了一次家。”
    主席问：“在家住了几天？参加劳动没有？”高碧岑说：“在家住了七天，参加劳动四天。”主席接着说：
  “那好啊！这也是一种学习，这是劳动课。你们现在只上了文化课，没有劳动课。别的学校都办工厂，搞实验，你回去和你们的领导商量一下看，我看你们单位可以办一个工厂。……”
    没有多少日子，就在党中央政治局举行北戴河会议期间，一中队就遵循着领袖的指示，白手办起了一座盐酸厂。大家利用业余时间捡废砖，在地上挖坑，砌炉子，架锅，又去土产公司运盐卤。连着忙了好几天，终于把盐酸烧制出来了。
    那时候，他们正在学化学。教员还画了图，专门给队员们讲：盐酸厂怎么建？盐卤为什么能变成盐酸？又列了表，分派队员们两人一班，每班劳动一天一夜，轮流实习烧盐酸。他们亲手烧出了盐酸，增长了办工业的知识。这样就把学习与生产实际结合起来了。
    当时，一中队每天还派人去中南海钢铁厂参加炼钢。他们糊炉子，砸铁，抬钢水；还带着化学课本，在转炉跟前上大课，学习由铁变钢的化学反应。通过炼钢，他们对什么叫一氧化铁，二氧化铁，什么是钢的成分，都熟悉了。
    队员杨树田已经掌握了炼钢技术。他黑黑的脸膛，戴着防火帽和有色的防护眼镜，站在炼钢炉前，十几个前来参加炼钢的队员，都拿着化学课本，在鼓风机震耳的隆隆声中听他讲课。杨树田一边指挥操作，一边讲课，……十一、二分钟就是一炉钢，就是一课。
    这天下午，敬爱的领袖毛主席亲自来看队员们炼钢，主席和队员们一个个地握手，看了炼钢炉，又看化铁炉。主席看着队员们都成了炼钢工人，一面笑一面说话，称赞他们：“你们作得很对！”又向队员们说：“你们搞得好！”
    这天晚上，队员们提出口号：决心炼出两吨钢，报答毛主席的关怀！郭长清的脚不慎被钢水烫伤了，但他还坚持着抬了一夜钢包。姜保海已经两天两夜没有好好休息了，他还坚持干了一个通夜。看，警卫队员们穿着被钢花烧成花花点点的工作服，手上、脸上带着光荣的烫伤和烟痕，坚守着中南海这座全民夺钢的阵地。他们是战士、是学生、又是工人。……（四）
    一天天，一年年，一中队的队员们不仅是在领袖的直接教诲和亲切关怀下，同时也是在领袖忘我的工作精神和不倦的学习精神的鼓舞下，顽强刻苦地坚持着文化学习。他们亲眼看到，我们伟大的领袖年纪那样大，知识那样渊博，但是工作起来、学习起来常常是废寝忘食。他们从主席那里是受到了多么深的教益，吸取了多么巨大的精神力量啊！
    从炎炎的夏夜，到风雪飘落的寒冬，主席屋里的那盏台灯，整夜整夜都是那样明亮。我们敬爱的领袖，经常就是这样无眠无休地操劳着国家大事。常常在宁静的深夜里，年青的队员们站在光荣的哨位上，望着这盏明亮的台灯，在心中默默地说：敬爱的主席，您累了，您该休息一下了！可是主席总是那样很有精神地坐在写字台前，仔细地看文件，写东西；实在太累了，才肯站起来走走，舒展舒展身体，而后再坐下来继续工作。
    敬爱的主席，除了紧张的工作，还抓紧点滴时间读书，读报刊杂志，读古今中外的各种书籍。特别使队员们深受感动的是，主席那样大年纪了，每天还学习外国文，夏夜十二点还在路灯下大声念外国文。队员们一想到主席念外国文，马上就会把那些难记的数学符号和化学方程式，反复背诵几遍，牢牢地记在心上。
    敬爱的领袖，每年都要抽出许多时间外出视察工作。他的行李，随行的队员一手就可以轻轻提起，而他带的书籍文件，却是一箱又一箱。那怕在轮船上，在火车上，甚至在高空的飞机上，主席总是在批阅文件，在看书，在学习外文；主席的座位上，也总是堆满了各种各样的书报。只要看到主席在旅途中学习的情形，随行的队员们，就会抓紧时间补课，坚决跟上家里的同志们的学习进度。
    就这样，不论在什么时候，也不论在什么地方，只要一想到主席在怎样地工作和学习，警卫队员们就会把学习中遇到的困难都忘记，把全部精力都投入了文化学习。
    这是可能的吗？那个原来连探家报告都写不好，算术程度也算最低的王文礼，居然能够在初中第一学年的学习中，变成警卫队的学习标兵。同时从第二学年开始，他还能够辅导程度较低的和出差回来的同志补习代数、几何、化学。人们都说他变化大，他也觉着自己变得出奇。
    孙连忠、高碧岑等人，有一次，一连气随主席外出六十来天。照说，缺课这样多，文化学习非掉队不可。那知转来以后，他们各门功课的进度不仅跟家里的一样，其中几何习题，他们还比家里的同志多作了四十几道。
    去年夏天的一次旅途中，主席坐在车窗前，正观看铁路沿线金浪翻滚的稻田。高碧岑从主席身边走过的时候，主席向他说：“这片稻子多好啊！”接着就问到他们的文化学习。主席说：
    “你们外出有时间学习吗？”
    高碧岑回答说：“我们现在在火车上也学习，每天都可以学习两个小时。”
    主席说：“你们现在学了哪些课程？还有哪些课程没有学完？”
    高碧岑答：“历史、地理、语文、代数、物理、化学都学完了，几何还有一半没有学完。”
    后来有一天，当主席知道孙连忠不仅负责组织随行的队员的文化学习，并且还能给新同志讲代数，便笑着说：
    “你们现在都成文人了。”
    主席的这句话正是对全体队员的最高的奖励。是的，这些来自全国各地的优秀的工农子弟，这些年来，在主席的亲切教导下，他们已经在工农群众知识化的道路上大大地迈进了一步。1959年8月，他们已经学完了初中课程。初中学习结业以后，他们有的已经在警卫部队当了指导员、排长和教员，有的被送到党校和军事学校去深造。但是他们的文化学习并没有中断。今年10月，仍然在一中队工作的队员们就要进入高等教育课程的学习。这些曾经在旧社会里被折磨得失去生活和学习权利的人，从前谁曾梦想到会有这样幸福的今天！年年月月，领袖的伟大的胸怀温暖着他们，抚育着他们，使他们飞快地成长起来了。当我们想到，这些优秀的工农子弟都是代表着解放军，同时又忠实履行着祖国六亿人民的嘱托，来警卫我们伟大领袖的时候，我们马上就会感到，敬爱的领袖对这些警卫战士的关怀，也正是对全体解放军官兵和对我国六亿劳动人民的关怀。让我们满怀着对伟大领袖的敬爱和感激，为了尽快地实现我国的文化革命而奋发前进吧！（附图片）
