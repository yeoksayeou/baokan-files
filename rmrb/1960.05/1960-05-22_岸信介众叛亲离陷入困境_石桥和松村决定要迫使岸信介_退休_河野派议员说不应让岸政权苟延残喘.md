Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 21st: News from Tokyo: The anti-Kishi movement within Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party is growing, and Japan's traitorous Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke has fallen into an increasingly isolated and unpopular position. In recent days, apart from the Kishi Nobusuke faction and his younger brother Sato Eisaku's Sato faction, the remaining six factions within the ruling party have held meetings to discuss the issue of ousting Kishi Nobusuke.

According to Japanese radio reports, a dozen Ishibashi faction lawmakers, led by Ishibashi Tanzan, held a meeting today to discuss the attitude they should adopt towards the future of Japanese politics. The meeting believed that the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet's introduction of police and the forced "passage" of the new "Security Treaty" in the House of Representatives was unacceptable. Therefore, it was decided to demand Kishi Nobusuke's immediate resignation. Ishibashi Tanzan also plans to convene a summit meeting of factions other than the Kishi and Sato factions at an appropriate opportunity.

The Ishibashi faction also agreed that, on the one hand, it would strive to unite the factions within the Liberal Democratic Party that oppose the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, and on the other hand, it would create an atmosphere that would lead to the resignation en masse of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet. Ishibashi Tanzan also held talks with Matsumura Kenzo yesterday, and they unanimously decided to gather the strength of various factions within the Liberal Democratic Party to force Kishi Nobusuke to "retire." In order to prevent Kishi Nobusuke from running for a third term, Ishibashi and Matsumura Kenzo agreed to jointly nominate a presidential candidate to confront Kishi Nobusuke. According to reports, Kono Ichiro stated at a meeting of Kono faction lawmakers yesterday that he was very indignant at Kishi Nobusuke's use of police force to forcibly vote on the new "Security Treaty." Most of the participants unanimously pointed out that the Kishi administration should not be allowed to continue to linger. Twenty-eight Liberal Democratic Party lawmakers belonging to the Ishibashi, Miki, Matsumura, Ishii, Ohno, and Ikeda factions held a meeting yesterday and jointly issued an agreement stating that they must seek to "change the political situation" at an appropriate time. Today, major newspapers published articles pointing out that Kishi Nobusuke is increasingly isolated within the ruling party and has fallen into difficulty, and believe that this situation is inevitable.

    岸信介众叛亲离陷入困境
    石桥和松村决定要迫使岸信介“退休”
    河野派议员说不应让岸政权苟延残喘
    新华社21日讯　东京消息：日本执政党自由民主党内的倒岸运动日益发展，日本卖国首相岸信介已陷于越来越孤立的众叛亲离的地位。连日来，除去岸信介派和他的胞弟佐藤荣作的佐藤派以外，执政党内其余六派纷纷集会，商讨把岸信介赶下台的问题。
    据日本电台报道，以石桥湛山为首的石桥派议员十几人今天举行会议，商讨对今后日本政局应该采取的态度。会议认为，岸信介内阁调进警察，在众议院强行“通过”新“安全条约”，是不能容许的。因此，决定要求岸信介立即辞职。石桥湛山还准备在适当的机会召开除了岸派和佐藤派以外的各派首脑会议。
    石桥派还商定，一方面要努力联合自由民主党内反对岸信介内阁的各派，另一方面要造成使岸信介内阁总辞职的气氛。石桥湛山昨天还和松村谦三举行会谈，一致决定，将汇集自由民主党各派力量迫使岸信介“退休”。为了阻止岸信介三次竞选，石桥和松村谦三商定，要联合提出总裁候选人同岸信介对抗。据报道，河野一郎在昨天举行的河野派议员的集会上表示，他对岸信介借助警察力量强行表决新“安全条约”非常愤慨。大多数与会者异口同声地指出，不应该让岸政权继续苟延残喘。属于石桥、三木一松村、石井、大野和池田派的二十八名自由民主党议员在昨天举行会议后，联合发表一项协议，表示必须在适当的时期谋求“转换政局”。今天各大报分别发表文章指出，岸信介在执政党内日益孤立，并且陷入困境。并认为这种局势是不可避免的。
