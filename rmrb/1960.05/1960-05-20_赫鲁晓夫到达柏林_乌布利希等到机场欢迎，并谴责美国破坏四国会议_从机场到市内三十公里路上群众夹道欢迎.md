Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 19th: Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Khrushchev, and his entourage arrived in Berlin by plane this afternoon from Paris.

Those present at the airport to welcome him included: First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED), Walter Ulbricht; Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic (GDR), Otto Grotewohl; Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Chamber, Johannes Dieckmann; Chairman of the National Council of the National Front of Democratic Germany, Erich Correns, as well as members of the Politburo of the SED Central Committee and Deputy Prime Ministers.

Also present at the airport to welcome him was the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Germany, Max Reimann.

Soviet Ambassador to the German Democratic Republic, Mikhail Pervukhin, and Commander-in-Chief of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany, Ivan Yakubovsky, and diplomatic envoys of various countries to the German Democratic Republic were also present at the airport to welcome him.

Khrushchev, accompanied by Ulbricht and Grotewohl, reviewed the guard of honor.

Ulbricht delivered a warm welcome on behalf of the government of the German Democratic Republic and the National Front, noting that the work carried out by the Soviet delegation in Paris was a struggle for peace. He said that the U.S. government, through this act of aggression of violating Soviet airspace, had shown that the United States had no intention of respecting international law. The peace-loving people of the German Democratic Republic understood very well that this U.S. imperialist act of airplane aggression was a challenge. The U.S. imperialist rulers believed they could do whatever they wanted in any country, and in this way, U.S. President Eisenhower destroyed the basis for talks on the eve of the conference.

Ulbricht said that the alliance established by West Germany and U.S. imperialism had become the main base of U.S. aggression in Europe. West German militarists were trying to turn West Berlin into a bridgehead for their provocations. The policy pursued by the peace-loving people of the German Democratic Republic and all peaceful forces in Germany was a true policy of peace.

Ulbricht expressed his belief that Khrushchev's visit and discussions in Berlin, along with his entourage, would help strengthen the German Democratic Republic as a bastion of peace and contribute to the cause of peace.

Khrushchev then spoke.

Along the approximately thirty-kilometer route from the airport to the Niederschönhausen district, Khrushchev was greeted by crowds of Berlin citizens lining the streets.

Xinhua News Agency, May 19th: According to TASS, Paris: Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Khrushchev, and his entourage flew from Orly Airport in Paris to Berlin today at the invitation of the government of the German Democratic Republic.

Khrushchev made a statement at the airport. Khrushchev said that the attitude adopted by the U.S. government had thwarted the summit meeting that the people of all countries, who eagerly hoped for a relaxation of international tensions and consolidation of peace, had so earnestly awaited.

Khrushchev said, "We are confident that the public in all countries will understand and correctly assess the just demand of the Soviet people that the United States cease its provocative acts of aggression, which have prevented the summit meeting from beginning."

Khrushchev continued, "The Soviet government has declared that it will continue tirelessly in the future to work to ensure peace and cooperation among all nations." Khrushchev said that the Soviet government remained ready to participate in a summit meeting if the United States would remove the obstacles it had created from the path leading to that meeting.

Those at the airport to see off the head of the Soviet government included: French Minister of State, Bernard Guyot; diplomatic envoys from various countries; Soviet Ambassador to France, Sergei Vinogradov; and journalists.

Parisian citizens gathered on the airport stands warmly bid farewell to the head of the Soviet government.

    新华社柏林19日电　苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫和他的随行人员今天下午由巴黎乘飞机到达柏林。
    到机场欢迎的有：德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希、德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥、人民议院主席团主席狄克曼、民主德国全国阵线全国委员会主席柯伦斯，以及统一社会党中央政治局委员们和政府副总理们。
    到机场欢迎的还有德国共产党中央委员会第一书记雷曼。
    苏联驻德意志民主共和国大使别尔乌辛和驻德苏军部队总司令雅库鲍夫斯基和各国驻德意志民主共和国外交使节也到机场欢迎。
    赫鲁晓夫在乌布利希和格罗提渥的陪同下检阅了仪仗队。
    乌布利希代表德意志民主共和国政府和全国阵线在机场上致热烈欢迎词，他指出，苏联代表团在巴黎所进行的工作是争取和平的斗争。他说，美国政府通过侵犯苏联领空的这一侵略行动，表明了美国没有尊重国际法的意图。爱好和平的德意志民主共和国人民很懂得，美国帝国主义集团的这一飞机侵略行动是一个挑战。美帝国主义统治者们自认为他们可以在任何国家为所欲为，就这样，美国总统艾森豪威尔在会议前夕破坏了会谈的基础。
  乌布利希说，西德和美国帝国主义所建立的联盟，成为美国在欧洲的主要的侵略基础。西德军国主义分子企图把西柏林变成他们进行挑衅的桥头堡。德意志民主共和国爱好和平的人民和全德国的和平力量所奉行的政策，是真正的和平政策。
    乌布利希表示相信，赫鲁晓夫和他的随行人员在柏林的访问和商谈，将有助于加强作为和平堡垒的德意志民主共和国，并有助于和平事业。
    赫鲁晓夫接着讲了话。
    从机场到尼特勋豪塞区约三十公里长的街道上，赫鲁晓夫受到柏林市民的夹道欢迎。
    新华社19日讯　据塔斯社巴黎讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫和他的随行人员今天乘飞机从巴黎奥利机场前往柏林，他们是应德意志民主共和国政府的邀请前往那里的。
    赫鲁晓夫在机场上发表了声明。赫鲁晓夫说，美国政府采取的态度，阻挠了渴望缓和国际紧张局势和巩固和平的各国人民所热切盼望的最高级会议的举行。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们相信，各国的公众会了解和正确地估价苏联人民要美国停止挑衅性的侵略行动的正义要求，最高级会议由于这种侵略行动未能开始举行。
    赫鲁晓夫继续说，苏联政府已经声明，它今后还将不倦地继续努力，以确保和平和各国人民之间的合作。赫鲁晓夫说，苏联政府仍然准备参加最高级会议，如果美国会把它所制造的障碍从通向这个会议的道路上清除掉的话。
    到机场欢送苏联政府首脑的有：法国总理办公厅部长居约马、各国外交使节、苏联驻法国大使维诺格拉多夫和新闻记者等。
