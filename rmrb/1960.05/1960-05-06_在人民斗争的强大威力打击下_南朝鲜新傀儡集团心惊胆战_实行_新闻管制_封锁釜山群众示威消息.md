Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 5th: Seoul Dispatch: Under the blows of the South Korean people's demonstration struggles, US imperialism and its running dogs are in extreme panic.

The so-called "Garrison Command," headed by Song Yo-chan, a running dog of the United States, hastily issued "Proclamation No. 18" on the evening of the 4th. Starting from five o'clock this morning, it implemented "control" over news reports in the Busan area, where demonstrations demanding the dissolution of the "puppet National Assembly" had erupted for days. Therefore, people are now unable to know the situation of the Busan people's struggle today.

In Seoul, the "corrupt National Assembly," which the people are demanding to be dissolved immediately, held a meeting today. US imperialism and its running dogs, fearing that the masses would hold demonstrations again, sent a large number of soldiers and police to guard the front of the puppet "National Assembly" building, prohibiting pedestrians from passing there.

Today is "Children's Day" in South Korea, and commemorative activities are held every year. However, US imperialism and its running dogs, who have already fallen into a state of extreme nervousness, are even afraid of children. Today, they even ordered "the cessation of all activities" and that "primary schools and kindergartens should hold classes as usual on this day."

    在人民斗争的强大威力打击下
    南朝鲜新傀儡集团心惊胆战
    实行“新闻管制”封锁釜山群众示威消息
    新华社平壤5日电　汉城消息：在南朝鲜人民示威斗争打击下，美帝国主义和它的走狗们恐慌万状。
    以美国走狗宋尧讚为头目的所谓“戒严司令部”在4日晚上慌忙发布了“十八号布告”，从今晨五时开始，对连日来爆发要求解散“伪国会”的示威的釜山地区的新闻报道实行“管制”。因此人们现在无法得知釜山人民今天斗争的情况。
    在汉城，被人民要求立即解散的“腐败的国会”今天开会，美帝国主义和它的走狗们害怕群众又举行示威，派了大批军警在伪“国会”议事堂前戒备森严，禁止行人在那里通行。
    今天是南朝鲜的“儿童日”，历年都举行纪念活动。但是，已经陷于草木皆兵状态的美帝国主义和它的走狗们，甚至对儿童们也很害怕，今天竟下令“停止一切活动”，“小学和幼稚园这一天要照常上课”。
