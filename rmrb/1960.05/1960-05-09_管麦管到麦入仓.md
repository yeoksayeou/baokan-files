    Manage the Wheat from Planting to Granary
      Good news of wheat harvests keeps pouring in from the South, and the struggle to achieve a bumper wheat harvest in the main wheat-producing areas of the North is proceeding victoriously. This year, all localities started early, grasped tightly, and managed meticulously the wheat fields. Wheat has smoothly passed the greening stage and the jointing stage, and is now in the stages of heading, flowering, and grain filling. People are saying that this year's wheat is growing better than in any previous year, and the foundation for a great summer harvest is becoming more solid. Now, our task is to exert even greater effort, strengthen the late-stage management of wheat fields, make the ears of wheat grow larger, and the grains grow fuller, and strive for an even greater wheat harvest.
    Currently, the wheat is growing very well, and a great harvest is in sight. However, we cannot say that the harvest is a foregone conclusion. From jointing and booting to maturity, the changes in wheat are still significant in these few dozen days. There are many possibilities for improvement, and there are also possibilities for deterioration. We must try every means to ensure that every wheat field improves and avoid any wheat field from deteriorating. "Ninety li is only half of a hundred-li journey," and now is the time when we cannot relax in the slightest.
    In the later stages of wheat growth, it needs sufficient fertilizer and water to consolidate its effective tillering and produce more and larger ears. With sufficient water and fertilizer, "third-class wheat" can be transformed into "first-class wheat." Without sufficient water and fertilizer, "first-class wheat" may also be "downgraded." In the later stages of wheat growth, it is also prone to lodging and being attacked by rust, wheat midges, and armyworms. If prevention and control are not effective, yields will be reduced or even lost. Therefore, the next few dozen days are a crucial moment in determining the success or failure of the wheat harvest. Only by seizing this opportunity, persevering in wheat field management to the end, watering and fertilizing according to the needs of wheat development and growth, preventing lodging, fighting against pests and diseases, and fighting against possible windstorms and floods, can we finally truly obtain the fruits of a great harvest.
    The central issue in the late-stage management of wheat fields is the fertilizer issue. Currently, wheat needs fast-acting fertilizers the most. Wherever there are fast-acting fertilizers, they should be quickly applied to the wheat fields with a spirit of seizing every second. Where there is not enough fertilizer, it should be accumulated immediately in a concentrated effort, and there is still time. The Beiyaojing Management District of Xingzhen Commune in Pucheng County, Shaanxi Province, organized special personnel to work hard for four days, digging out human manure from more than 2,800 toilets in every lane and household, and added other fertilizers to apply one additional fertilizer application to 2,200 mu of third-class wheat. This example shows that as long as we are full of energy, widely mobilize the masses, and make a concentrated effort to dig up fertilizer sources, the difficulty of insufficient fertilizer can be solved. For fertilizer, it is necessary not only to apply more but also to apply skillfully, "observing the weather, the land, and the crops," and providing wheat with the most necessary nutrients in a targeted manner.
    In addition to focusing on fertilizer, two other things must be done well in the late-stage management of wheat fields: continuing to fight drought and preventing and controlling pests and diseases. Currently, drought continues in a few wheat-producing areas, and it is necessary to persist in irrigating wheat to combat drought. Wheat rust has appeared in many areas, and it is necessary to mobilize the masses to prevent and control it universally. Overcoming rust and other pests and diseases is an important condition for ensuring a great wheat harvest.
    Many regions are focusing their current efforts in wheat field management on concentrating on eliminating third-class wheat and transforming low-yield areas, which is entirely correct. The determining factor for a bumper harvest lies in increasing production universally over a large area. Under the circumstances that most wheat is growing very vigorously, taking forceful measures to promote the rapid development and growth of those third-class wheat that are growing slowly and developing late is a very important aspect of tapping the potential for increased production. This year, there is much less third-class wheat in various localities than in previous years, and after the management of the past few months, some of the third-class wheat has been "upgraded." However, it is understood that many regions still have about 10% of third-class wheat, and some regions have even more. Because the total area of wheat fields has increased this year, even if the percentage of third-class wheat is very small, its absolute number is still very large. If we do not tap the potential for increased production from a large-scale transformation of third-class wheat, it is very likely to affect the realization of this year's wheat production plan. Some people say, "Third-class wheat is born with its bones and grown with its meat, and no matter how much processing is done, it is a waste of effort." The error in this view lies in viewing the problem from a static perspective. Third-class wheat is by no means without a future. Third-class wheat grows weakly and develops late only because it has not received enough nutrients and water. As long as it is supplied with more fast-acting fertilizer and appropriate watering, it can quickly become healthy. The Dongjiao Commune of Licheng County, Shandong Province, watered third-class wheat and applied 20 jin of ammonium sulfate per mu, and the number of tillers per mu that were booting increased by 30,000 compared to third-class wheat that was not watered and fertilized, and the number of grains per ear also increased, and it is estimated that the yield per mu may increase by more than 30 jin. If the 10% to 20% of third-class wheat in various regions can increase production by 30 to 40 jin per mu, this would be a very large number nationwide.
    Since the Great Leap Forward, we have already won two great summer harvests, and we are now fighting to realize the third great summer harvest. We should seize the current precious opportunity, go further, break through the last hurdle of wheat field management, strive for a greater summer harvest, and make a greater contribution to the realization of better and more comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production this year.

    管麦管到麦入仓
      南方不断传来小麦丰收喜讯，北方主要产麦区争取小麦大丰收的斗争正在胜利进行。今年，各地对麦田管理抓得早，抓得紧，管得细，小麦已经顺利度过返青关、拔节关，正在抽穗、扬花和灌浆。人们都说今年的小麦长得比任何一年都好，夏季大丰收的基础越来越坚实了。现在，我们的任务是更加一把劲，加强麦田的后期管理，使麦穗长得更大，麦粒长得更饱满，争取小麦获得更大的丰收。
    目前小麦生长情况非常好，大丰收胜利在望。但是，还不能说丰收已经定局。从拔节、孕穗到成熟，在这不多的几十天中，小麦的变化还是很大的，变好的可能性很多，变坏的可能性也不是没有。我们要想尽一切办法，争取每一块麦田变好，避免任何一块麦田变坏。“行百里半九十”，现在是丝毫松懈不得的。
    小麦生长的后期，需要充足的肥料和水分，以便巩固它的有效分蘖，多出穗，长大穗。水肥足了，“三类麦”可以变成“一类麦”，水肥不充足，“一类麦”也可能“降级”。小麦生长的后期，又容易倒伏和遭受锈病、吸浆虫、粘虫的侵害。如果防治不力，就会减收甚至失收。因此，今后这几十天，正是决定小麦收成好坏的重要关头。只有抓住这个时机，把麦田管理坚持到底，按照小麦发育生长的需要，浇水加肥，防止倒伏，同病虫害作斗争，和可能发生的风灾、雨涝作斗争，才能最后把大丰收的果实真正拿到手。
    麦田后期管理的中心问题是肥料问题。目前小麦最需要速效肥料。凡是有速效肥料的，应当以分秒必争的精神，赶快追施到麦田里。肥料不够的地方，应该立即突击积造，还来得及。陕西省蒲城县兴镇公社北姚荆管理区组织专人，奋战四天，逐巷逐户挖出二千八百多个厕所的人粪尿，加上其他肥料，给二千二百亩三类麦增施了一次肥。这个例子说明，只要鼓足干劲，广泛发动群众，突击大挖肥源，肥料不足的困难是可以解决的。对于肥料，不但要多施，还要巧施，“看天看地看庄稼”，对症下药地供给小麦以最必需的养分。
    大抓肥料而外，麦田后期管理还要做好两件事：就是继续抗旱和防治病虫害。目前少数产麦区旱象仍在继续，需要坚持抗旱浇麦。小麦锈病已在不少地区出现，必须发动群众，普遍防治。战胜锈病和其他病虫害，是保证小麦大丰收的重要条件。
    许多地区把当前麦田管理的主攻目标放在突击消灭三类麦和改造低产区上面，这是完全正确的。丰收的决定因素在于大面积普遍增产。在大多数小麦生长发育十分旺盛的情况下，采取有力措施促使那些生长慢、发育晚的三类麦迅速发育、成长，是挖掘增产潜力的一个很重要的方面。今年各地的三类麦比往年少得多，经过过去几个月的管理，又有一部分三类麦“升级”了。但是，据了解，许多地区还有10％左右的三类麦，有些地区的三类麦还要多些。由于今年的麦田总面积增加了，三类麦的百分数即使很小，它的绝对数还是很大。如果不从大量改造三类麦方面挖掘增产潜力，很可能影响今年小麦增产计划的实现。有些人说，
  “三类麦是生就的骨头、长就的肉，再多加工也是白费力气。”这种看法的错误，在于是用静止的观点看问题。三类麦决不是没有发展前途的。三类麦长得弱，发育晚，只是因为没有得到足够的养分和水分，只要多供给速效肥料和适当浇水，它们就能够很快健壮起来。山东省历城县东郊公社给三类麦浇了水，每亩追了二十斤硫安，每亩孕穗的株数比没有浇水追肥的三类麦增加了三万个，每穗的粒数也有所增加，估计每亩可能增产三十多斤。如果各地占10％到20％的三类麦每亩都能增产三、四十斤，这在全国来说就是一个极大的数字。
    大跃进以来，我们已经赢得了两个夏季大丰收，现在正在为实现第三个夏季大丰收而斗争。我们应该抓住目前的宝贵时机，百尺竿头，更进一步，攻破麦田管理最后一关，争取更大的夏季丰收，为实现今年农业生产更好更全面的跃进作出更大的贡献。
