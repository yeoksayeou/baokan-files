Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, Electric dispatch from TASS: Soviet scientists have made statements commenting on the achievement of launching a satellite-spaceship and the prospects for space flight.

The President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, A.N. Nesmeyanov, issued a statement to TASS reporters regarding the Soviet Union's launching of a spaceship into Earth's satellite orbit, saying: "May this brilliant achievement of human wisdom, the beacon of progress—the Soviet spaceship, the new stage of interplanetary flight, be a messenger of peace that accompanies the Soviet Union's lofty mission on the international stage. We Soviet scientists firmly declare that outer space should only be used for peaceful purposes."

Professor Dobronravov, a famous Soviet scientist, said that the problem of the satellite returning to Earth will soon be solved, and scientific workers will fly into space. He said that the sealed cabin of the Soviet spaceship, which entered Earth's satellite orbit on the 15th, is equipped with everything necessary to ensure human living conditions and conduct scientific research. General living room conditions have been created inside the cabin.

Professor Dobronravov said that the characteristic of the satellite-spaceship is that it is manipulated to some extent. After the necessary materials are obtained from the satellite-spaceship, the sealed cabin will detach from the spaceship, and after the reliability of its function is tested, the sealed cabin, like the satellite-spaceship body, will begin to descend according to ground commands.

Professor Dobronravov said that the duration of the Soviet satellite-spaceship's stay in space will depend on when its instruments have sent back all the data, after which a descent command will be issued to the satellite's equipment. He also pointed out that the spaceship's sealed cabin is equipped with all the necessary equipment to ensure human survival and conduct scientific investigations. Information about all physical processes inside the cabin will be sent back by special radio transmitters installed on the satellite. After obtaining the necessary data, the sealed cabin will be detached from the spaceship, and the sealed cabin, like the satellite-spaceship, will begin to descend according to ground commands after checking its function.

He finally said that the date for solving the problem of the satellite returning to Earth is not far off. At that time, Soviet scientific workers will enter outer space.

Merkulov, Deputy Director of the Cosmonautics Department of the Soviet Aviation Sports Association, commented on the significance of the Soviet spaceship launched on the 15th, saying that the high quality of the spaceship shows that the date for Soviets to complete flights to other planets in the solar system is approaching.

Merkulov said that the weights of the Soviet Union's first three artificial Earth satellites and the spaceship launched on the 15th eloquently prove the outstanding achievements of Soviet rocket technology. Their weights were 80 kilograms, 500 kilograms, 1.5 tons, and 4.5 tons, respectively. The weight of just the third satellite alone is greater than the total weight of all successful satellites launched by the United States.

Professor Pokrovsky, a famous Soviet scientist, said that the launch of the spaceship first proved the extraordinary power of Soviet rocket technology. The success of this launch is due to the successful development of rocket dynamics, increasing rocket weight, volume, and structural strength.

Pokrovsky emphasized that the Soviet Union is once again ahead of all countries in conquering outer space.

Academician Karry-Niazov of the Uzbek Academy of Sciences said that the Soviet Union's launch of a 4.5-ton spaceship once again showed the world its superiority in the study of the universe. "This experiment is completely in line with the rules." He said confidently, "The Soviet Union is approaching such a historic day, that is, turning interplanetary travel from fantasy into reality."

Klimenko, the director of the Stalingrad Artificial Satellite Observation Station, said that the scientific significance of the satellite-spaceship is enormous. It operates in outer space very close to the Earth, which will help us to understand what effects weightlessness, cosmic rays, and other phenomena will have on future space explorers.

Virman, the leader of the Estonian branch of the All-Union Astronomical and Geodetic Society, predicted that based on the current development of Soviet science and technology, the work of preparing people to fly into space is very likely to take not years, but only a few months. The great moment of human flight into space may come this year.

    苏联科学家谈宇宙飞船上天的巨大意义
    苏联火箭威力强大星际旅行为期不远
    据新华社莫斯科电　据塔斯社报道：苏联科学家纷纷发表谈话，评论发射卫星式飞船的成就及宇宙飞行的前景。
    苏联科学院院长?斯米扬诺夫就苏联把宇宙飞船射入地球卫星轨道对塔斯社记者发表声明说：“愿人类智慧的这一光辉成就、进步的灯塔——苏联宇宙飞船、行星际飞行的新阶段，成为随着苏联在国际舞台上的崇高使命而来的和平信使。我们苏联科学家坚定地声明：宇宙空间只应当用于和平目的。”
    苏联著名科学家多勃隆拉沃夫教授说，在不久的将来卫星回到地球的问题即将解决，科学工作者将在宇宙的空间内飞行。他说，15日进入地球卫星轨道的苏联宇宙飞船的密封舱备有一切必需的装备，这些装备保证了人的生活条件和进行科学研究的条件。舱内创造了一般居室的条件。
    多勃隆拉沃夫教授说，卫星式飞船的特点在于，它在某种程度上是被操纵的。在从卫星式飞船上收得了必需的材料之后，密封舱将脱离飞船，密封舱在其功能的可靠性得到检验之后，同卫星式飞船船身一样，将根据地上的命令开始下降。
    多勃隆拉沃夫教授说，苏联卫星式宇宙飞船在宇宙间停留的期限，将取决于它的仪器何时发完一切数据，下降命令将在这以后对卫星的装备发出。他还指出，飞船密封舱装备了保证人的生存及进行科学考察所需要的一切必要装备。关于舱内一切物理过程的情报将由装在卫星上的特制无线电发射装置发回。在获得了必要数据以后，将使密封舱脱离飞船，密封舱将像卫星式飞船一样，在检查其功能以后根据地面的命令开始下降。
    他最后说，解决卫星返回地面问题的日期已经不远了。那时苏联科学工作者就将进入宇宙空间。
    苏联航空体育协会宇宙航行部副主任麦尔库洛夫在评论苏联15日发射的宇宙飞船意义时说，宇宙飞船的高质量说明，苏联人完成到太阳系其它行星去的飞行日期已经临近了。
    麦尔库洛夫说，苏联头三个人造地球卫星和15日发射的宇宙飞船的重量雄辩地证明了苏联火箭技术的杰出成就。它们的重量先后分别是八十公斤、五百公斤、一点五吨和四点五吨。而仅仅第三个卫星一个卫星的重量就比美国所有已发射成功的卫星的重量总和还要大。
    苏联著名科学家波克罗夫斯基教授说，宇宙飞船的发射首先证明了苏联火箭技术的非凡强大。这次发射成功是由于火箭动力学、增加火箭的重量、体积和构造强度方面获得了成功的发展。
    波克罗夫斯基强调指出，在征服宇宙空间方面，苏联再一次走在了各国的前面。
    乌兹别克科学院院士卡雷—尼亚佐夫说，苏联发射重量为四点五吨的宇宙飞船，再一次向全世界显示了它在研究宇宙方面的优势。“这一试验是完全合乎规律的”。他满怀信心地说，“苏联已经接近了这样具有历史意义的一天，即把行星际旅行从幻想变成现实”。
    斯大林格勒人造卫星观测站站长克利缅科说，卫星式飞船的科学意义是巨大的。它在离地球极近的宇宙空间中运行，这就会帮助我们弄清楚，超重、宇宙线和其他现象对未来的宇宙飞行家将产生什么影响。
    全苏天文测地学会爱沙尼亚分会领导人维尔曼预言说，根据苏联科学技术目前发展情况看来，准备人飞入宇宙的工作十分可能不需要几年，而只需要几个月。人飞入宇宙的伟大时刻可能在今年就会到来。
