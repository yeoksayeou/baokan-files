    Strive for a Victorious Tomorrow
    Guo Moruo
    Japanese friends!
    Your struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance is growing ever more powerful, like the waves of the Pacific Ocean in a typhoon, each wave higher than the last, bound to wash away the reactionary camp.
    I congratulate you, I salute you, I cheer for you!
    Because of your efforts, Nobusuke Kishi has exposed his own fascist, ferocious face, using violence to trample upon your parliament, beating your parliamentarians, and arresting your workers, farmers, and young students. War criminal Nobusuke Kishi remains a war criminal; his style is no better than Syngman Rhee’s.
    You say that Nobusuke Kishi is Japan's Syngman Rhee, and I think that is completely correct. However, Nobusuke Kishi's end may be even worse than Syngman Rhee's, because he has done so much evil that even people in his own party are opposing him.
    The Japanese people are patriotic. If some people in the past may not have seen Nobusuke Kishi clearly, then now they will certainly recognize him. Not only have Nobusuke Kishi and his small group of partners exposed their ferocious faces, but their backstage bosses, U.S. imperialism and Eisenhower, have also exposed their ferocious faces.
    U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of world peace. The recent summit conference in Paris failed to materialize because it deliberately sabotaged it. On the eve of the conference—May 1st—the United States sent a U-2 plane to invade the Soviet Union. It was shot down, and the pilot was captured alive. The robber logic expressed by the U.S. government and Eisenhower is appalling, and I don't need to say more here.
    Previously, some well-intentioned people had illusions about the United States, especially about Eisenhower, thinking that he was a "peace president" who might bring peace to the world.
    What about now? U.S. imperialism has exposed all the truth, and Eisenhower has also torn off his mask of peace. America's allies, even American politicians, are complaining about them, saying they have done something too stupid!
    Yes, Eisenhower and U.S. imperialism are really too stupid, and Nobusuke Kishi and his small group of partners are also too stupid. The reason they are so stupid is that they are too cunning. We Chinese have an old saying: "The more you fabricate, the more clumsy you become." I believe that Japanese friends are no strangers to this saying. Those who do evil try every means to cover it up, but they always end up showing their true colors. The more they try to cover up, the more tragic the exposure. Today's Nobusuke Kishi and Eisenhower are like this.
    I believe that those who had illusions about them are now disillusioned. Therefore, Nobusuke Kishi's self-exposure is very beneficial to the Japanese people's movement to strive for independence; Eisenhower's self-exposure is very beneficial to the world people's movement to strive for peace. Who can still believe that the new "Security Treaty" concluded by Nobusuke Kishi and Eisenhower is not a war treaty? Who can still believe that U.S. imperialism is not instigating war?
    Japanese friends, keep up the good work! You are about to launch the seventeenth national unified action, and I believe you will mobilize more Japanese people. Even the Japanese police who were still serving Nobusuke Kishi yesterday, I believe, will sooner or later be mobilized by you. Once the deception they have suffered is exposed, they will never willingly be the pawns of dictators who sell out their country. The deeper one is deceived, the more severely one will punish the deceiver!
    Now is truly a time of great opportunity. The flames of overthrowing traitorous dictators are burning from the east of Asia to the west of Asia, and the wave of opposition to U.S. imperialism is surging from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean. The oppressed people of the whole world must stand up! The end of traitorous dictators has arrived! The burial of imperialism is imminent!
    Victory belongs to the Japanese people!
    Strengthen unity, support each other, and strive for a victorious tomorrow!

    争取胜利的明天
    郭沫若
    日本的朋友们！
    你们反对日美军事同盟的斗争，愈来愈声势浩大了，像台风中的太平洋的海浪一样，一浪高过一浪，势必把反动派的阵营冲涮干净。
    我祝贺你们，我慰劳你们，我为你们欢呼！
    由于你们的努力，使岸信介自己暴露了自己的法西斯的凶恶面相，使用暴力蹂躏了你们的国会，殴打了你们的议员，逮捕了你们的工人、农民和青年学生。战争罪犯的岸信介依然是战争罪犯，他的作风，并不比李承晚高明半分。
    你们说岸信介是日本的李承晚，我看是完全正确的。但是，岸信介的下场可能比李承晚还要坏，因为他作恶多端，连他同党的人都在反对他了。
    日本人民是爱国的。如果过去有些人，对于岸信介，也许还看不清楚，那末现在他们一定会认清了，不仅岸信介和他一小撮的伙伴暴露了他们自己的凶相，就是他们的后台老板，美帝国主义和艾森豪威尔，也暴露了自己的凶相了。
    美帝国主义是世界和平的最凶恶的敌人，最近在巴黎的首脑会议没有开成，就是它蓄意毁坏的。在会议的前夕——5月1日，美国派遣U—2式飞机去侵略苏联，被打下了，飞机师也被生擒了。美国政府和艾森豪威尔所发表的强盗逻辑是惊人的，我在这里用不着多说。
    以前有些好心肠的人对于美国是有幻想的，特别对于艾森豪威尔尤其有幻想，以为他是一位“和平总统”，他可能给世界带来和平。
    现在怎样呢？美帝国主义把一切真相暴露了，艾森豪威尔也把自己的和平假面具揭穿了。美国的盟友，连美国的政治家们都在埋怨他们，说他们做得太蠢！
    是的，艾森豪威尔和美帝国主义实在太蠢了，岸信介和他一小撮的伙伴也太蠢了。其所以太蠢，就是因为他们太狡猾。我们中国有句古话：“作伪日劳日拙”，日本朋友们对于这句话，我相信不会是陌生的。为非作歹的人想尽种种方法来掩饰，然而总是要露马脚的。掩饰得愈厉害，暴露得愈悲惨。今天的岸信介和艾森豪威尔就是这个样子。
    对于他们有幻想的人，我相信是在幻灭了。因此，岸信介的自我揭露，对日本人民争取独立的运动是大有利的；艾森豪威尔的自我暴露对世界人民争取和平的运动是大有利的。谁还能相信：由岸信介与艾森豪威尔所缔结的新“安全条约”不是战争条约？谁还能相信：美帝国主义不在策动战争呢？
    日本朋友们，再接再厉吧！你们要发起第十七次全国统一行动了，我相信你们一定会动员更多的日本人民。连昨天还在替岸信介服务的日本警察，我相信早迟也会被你们动员起来。他们所受的蒙蔽一被揭穿，决不会甘心替出卖祖国的独裁者做爪牙的。谁受欺骗愈深，谁就会愈严厉地惩罚欺骗者！
    现在真是形势大好的时候，打倒卖国独裁者的烽火从亚洲的东边燃到亚洲的西边，反对美帝国主义的浪潮由太平洋涌到了大西洋。全世界被压迫的人民都要站起来了。卖国独裁者的末期到了！帝国主义的埋葬迫在眼前了！
    胜利是属于日本人民的！
    加强团结，相互声援，争取胜利的明天！
             一九六○年五月二十四日
