Xinhua News Agency, New York, May 28th: Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko held a press conference at the United Nations headquarters after the United Nations Security Council special meeting concluded its discussion on the aggressive actions of American aircraft.

　　Gromyko said that during the discussion of this issue, the statements of the American representative in the Security Council and Eisenhower's radio address on May 25, etc., all confirmed that the actions of the U.S. President are those of an enemy of peace. A government that openly declares military espionage and subversion against another country as its policy cannot be an honest party in negotiations, no matter how often such a government expresses its willingness to negotiate or seek agreement.

　　Gromyko asked, does anyone in Washington truly hope that the Soviet Union, the Soviet people, will hand over to them intelligence that facilitates the preparation of a war of aggression by the American military?

　　He said: The Soviet Union and its armed forces have only one answer for those who like to reach into our country to grab such intelligence. That answer is simple: to cut off that hand.

　　Gromyko said: Attempting to justify the international pirate policy declared by the U.S. government as its policy principle by using the pretext of the Soviet Union's refusal to accept the so-called "Open Skies" plan can only deceive fools. A country that is not preparing for a war of aggression does not need intelligence about the military secrets of other countries and intelligence obtained through aerial reconnaissance. A country only needs such intelligence when it is preparing to launch a war of aggression and hopes to aim its weapons at the military and industrial targets of another country. This is exactly what the Pentagon wants from the Soviet Union's "Open Skies."

　　He said: The skies of the Soviet Union have always been closed to all our enemies, and will continue to be closed to them in the future, just as our land and sea borders are powerfully sealed off (to them).

　　Gromyko emphasized that peaceful coexistence, predicated on the strict observance by all countries of each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity, is the only path that is in the vital interests of the Soviet and American peoples and the interests of world peace.

　　Gromyko condemned the position of the representatives of the NATO member states, who obstructed the Security Council from taking a decision to condemn the aggressors. He said that we accuse them of being, in effect, accomplices of the aggressors.

　　Gromyko pointed out that some of the speeches by the representatives of countries such as Ceylon and Tunisia contained clear words condemning disrespect for the sovereignty of other countries.

　　Gromyko finally analyzed the results of the special meeting of the United Nations Security Council, saying: We believe that discussing the issue raised by the Soviet government in the Security Council was beneficial because not only the Soviet Union and Poland, but also representatives of certain other countries condemned the policies of the United States. However, since the Security Council has not adopted a resolution condemning the aggressors, and since the U.S. government authorities have stated that they will continue to pursue a policy of dangerous provocation against the Soviet Union, therefore, the Soviet government intends to submit this issue to the United Nations General Assembly.

　　Gromyko then answered various questions raised by the reporters.

    葛罗米柯评洛奇在安理会的发言和艾森豪威尔的广播演说
    美国总统的举动是和平敌人的举动
    苏联准备把美机侵苏事件提交联大讨论
    新华社29日讯　据塔斯社纽约28日讯：苏联外交部长葛罗米柯在联合国安全理事会特别会议结束讨论美国飞机的侵略行动以后在联合国总部举行了记者招待会。
    葛罗米柯说，在讨论这个问题期间，美国代表在安理会的发言和艾森豪威尔5月25日的广播演说等情况都证实，美国总统的举动是和平的敌人的举动。一国政府公然地宣布对另一个国家进行军事间谍和颠覆活动是它的政策，不论这样的政府如何经常地表示愿意进行谈判或谋求达成协议，它在谈判中不可能成为诚实的一方。
    葛罗米柯问道，在华盛顿是否有人真正希望苏联、苏联人民会把便于美国军人准备进行侵略战争的情报交给他们呢？
    他说：苏联和它的武装部队对于爱把自己的双手伸到我们国家中来捞取这种情报的人只有一种回答。这种回答很简单，那就是斩断这种手。
    葛罗米柯说：企图借口苏联拒绝接受所谓“开放天空”计划，来为美国政府宣称是它的政策原则的国际海盗政策辩解，这也是只能欺骗傻瓜而已。一个国家不进行侵略战争的准备，就不需要有关他国军事秘密的情报以及由空中侦察所获取的情报。一个国家只有在准备发动侵略战争，并且希望把自己的武器对准另一个国家的军事和工业目标的时候，它才需要这种情报。这恰恰是五角大楼要求苏联“开放天空”所要的东西。
    他说：苏联的天空对我们的一切敌人来说，是一直关闭着的，今后也仍将向他们关闭，正如我们的地面和海上边界（对他们）是强有力地封锁着的一样。
    葛罗米柯着重指出，以各国严格遵守彼此的主权和领土完整为先决条件的和平共处是符合苏联和美国两国人民的切身利益和全世界和平利益的唯一途径。
    葛罗米柯谴责北大西洋公约组织成员国代表的立场，他们阻挠安理会采取谴责侵略者的决定。他说，我们指责他们实际上是侵略者的帮凶。
    葛罗米柯指出，锡兰和突尼斯等国代表的部分发言中含有谴责不尊重其他国家的主权的明确的话。
    葛罗米柯最后分析了联合国安全理事会特别会议的结果，他说：我们认为，在安全理事会讨论苏联政府所提出的问题是有益的，因为，不仅苏联和波兰，而且某些其它国家的代表也谴责美国的政策。可是既然安全理事会没有通过决议谴责侵略者，既然美国政府当局声称它将继续奉行对苏联进行危险挑衅的政策，因此，苏联政府打算把这个问题向联合国大会提出。
    葛罗米柯然后答复了记者们所提出的各项问题。
