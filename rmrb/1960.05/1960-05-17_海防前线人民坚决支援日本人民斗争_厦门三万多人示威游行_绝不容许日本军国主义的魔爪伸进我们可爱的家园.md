Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, May 15th: Xiamen City, situated on the front line of Fujian's coastal defense, held rallies and demonstrations in four locations today despite the heavy rain, with over 30,000 people participating. They resolutely supported the Japanese people's just struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty.

From 1938 to 1945, during the Japanese寇's occupation of Xiamen, the beautiful seaside garden was turned into a hell on earth. Today, thousands of workers and residents who suffered persecution back then participated in the demonstrations. An old woman, Lin Rouyuan, whose husband was killed by Japanese bandits nineteen years ago, participated in the rally and demonstration with her two children. Her eldest son was only three years old when the Japanese occupied Xiamen, and now he has joined the militia. Today, he marched at the front of the procession, fully armed. She said, "We must never allow the clutches of Japanese militarism to extend into our beloved homeland again, destroying our peaceful and happy life." Militiamen who work day and night with the People's Liberation Army to defend the motherland's coastal defense front came from the front-line areas to participate in the rally and demonstration today. They said, "The standing-up Chinese people are inviolable. If the enemy dares to come up from there, we will resolutely eliminate them there."

After the meeting began, Zhang Jianmo, Secretary of the Xiamen Municipal Party Committee Secretariat, spoke, paying tribute to the heroic Japanese people on behalf of the city's people and expressing full support for the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle until final victory.

    新华社福州15日电　处在福建海防前线的厦门市，今天有三万多人冒着滂沱大雨分四处举行集会和示威游行，坚决支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的正义斗争。
    1938年到1945年，日寇侵占厦门期间，把美丽海上花园变成了暗无天日的人间地狱。今天有千百个当年遭受迫害的工人和居民参加了示威游行。一位在十九年前丈夫被日本强盗害死的老大娘林肉圆，带着自己的两个孩子参加了集会游行。她的大儿子在日本侵占厦门时只有三岁，现在已经参加民兵了，今天全副武装地走在队伍的前面。她说，我们决不能让日本军国主义的魔爪再伸进我们可爱的家园，破坏我们和平幸福的生活。日夜配合人民解放军保卫祖国海防的前沿民兵们，今天从前沿地区赶来参加大会和示威游行，他们说，站起来的中国人民是不可侵犯的，敌人敢从那里上来，我们就坚决把它消灭在那里。
    大会开始以后，中共厦门市委书记处书记张渐摩讲话，他代表全市人民向英雄的日本人民致敬，并表示全力支持日本人民的爱国正义斗争，一直到最后胜利。
