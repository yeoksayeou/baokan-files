Xinhua News Agency, May 2nd, New York dispatch: The American big business mouthpiece "Business Week" published an article on April 30th, vigorously advocating the need to support a new puppet regime in South Korea and to play new political conspiracies to paralyze the fighting spirit of the South Korean people, in order to maintain American colonial rule in South Korea.

The article revealed the considerations behind the United States' having to let Syngman Rhee step down. It wrote: "The United States agreed that Syngman Rhee must step down because the longer he stayed in power, the greater the danger of anarchy and riots (this is a slanderous statement by American newspapers against the South Korean people's patriotic and just struggle - editor) leading to the rise of radical leaders with whom the United States would have difficulty dealing." The magazine went on to say, "Washington officials say that the United States cannot allow the situation to deteriorate to this point," "If control over (South Korea) is lost, it will not only shake our military-political strategy in the Far East, but will also be politically intolerable at home in the United States."

The magazine said, "With Rhee's departure, Washington, especially the Pentagon, is deeply concerned about what kind of regime will succeed Syngman Rhee." The magazine then vigorously advocated that the United States must "maintain a strong position in (South) Korea" and "needs a friendly and stable government."

The magazine also revealed the US government's conspiracy to support new puppets through sham elections in South Korea and the theft of the United Nations' name to "supervise" the elections, in order to present a facade to world public opinion, especially the opinion of Asian and African countries. The magazine said, "Many countries in South and Southeast Asia dislike Syngman Rhee's dictatorial methods and often criticize the United States' support for Syngman Rhee." The magazine expressed the hope that "if the United States can now cultivate a more democratic government in (South) Korea, then the United States' capital elsewhere will increase." The magazine said, "The United States would be happy to see the Democratic Party come to power. The party's domestic and foreign policies are largely the same as Rhee's Liberal Party, and it will continue to cooperate with the United States." However, it worried that the Democratic Party could not control the situation, and it also expressed great interest in the South Korean soldiers who were fostered by the United States, saying, "Perhaps the most important factor in the (South) Korean political situation now is the army under the command of General Song Yo-chan," "The army will probably become the main pillar of any government formed."

According to Xinhua News Agency, May 1st, Washington dispatch: American bourgeois journalist Joseph Alsop published an article in the "Washington Post" on April 27th, worried that the South Korean people's heroic struggle against the Syngman Rhee group's fascist rule would be "a harbinger of a storm that should not be ignored," foreshadowing that some other puppet regimes of the United States in Asia would suffer the same fate.

In this article entitled "Thunderclouds in Asia," Alsop said that the "lesson of the great outbreak" in South Korea is that the puppet regimes fostered by the Eisenhower government in Asia are "by no means as stable as they have always seemed." He admitted that wherever the United States has fostered a puppet regime, there is "always a tendency" towards "political corruption." The "outbreak" in South Korea is "the result of political corruption." Alsop believes that "the outbreak in (South) Korea is a harbinger of a storm that cannot be ignored." He said that this matter should make the United States "pay attention to the somewhat similar situation in South Vietnam."

Alsop pointed out that "today the government of South Vietnam is almost a family government, and this situation prevents the emergence of vibrant political life locally." He pointed to the struggle of the people throughout South Vietnam against the Ngo Dinh Diem regime. He believes that although the situation in South Vietnam "has not yet reached a sharp point, it is already quite bad."

Alsop believes that the Lao Sananikone regime and Taiwan's Chiang Kai-shek group, which were fostered by the United States, are also facing bleak prospects.

    企图玩弄新的政治阴谋来麻痹南朝鲜人民的斗志
    美报鼓吹扶植傀儡政府维持殖民统治
    艾尔索普担心亚洲其它傀儡政权前景也都不妙
    新华社2日讯　纽约消息：美国大企业喉舌“商业周刊”4月30日的一篇文章竭力鼓吹必须在南朝鲜扶植一个新傀儡政权，并且玩弄新的政治阴谋来麻痹南朝鲜人民的斗志，以维持美国在南朝鲜的殖民统治。
    文章吐露了美国所以不得不让李承晚下台的考虑。它写道：“美国同意李承晚必须下台，理由是他在位越久，无政府状态和暴乱（这是美国报刊对南朝鲜人民爱国正义斗争的诬蔑说法——编者）导致那些美国难以与之相处的激烈的领袖上台的危险就越大”。这家周刊接着说，“华盛顿的官员说，美国不能允许局势恶化到这种地步”，“如果丧失对（南朝鲜）的控制，不但会动摇我们在远东的军事—政治战略，而且在政治方面在美国国内也是不能容忍的”。
    这家周刊说，“随着李的下台，华盛顿、特别是五角大楼深深关心的是李承晚的继任将是什么样的政权”。这家周刊接着竭力鼓吹美国必须“在（南）朝鲜保持一个坚强的地位”，“需要一个友好而稳定的政府”。
    这家周刊同时还透露美国政府企图通过在南朝鲜举行伪选举以及盗用联合国名义“监督”选举的手法来扶植新傀儡的阴谋，以便在世界舆论，特别是亚非国家舆论面前装扮门面。周刊说，“在南亚和东南亚许多国家都是不喜欢李承晚的独裁方法的，并且经常批评美国对李承晚的支持”。周刊表示希望，
  “如果美国现在在（南）朝鲜能够培养一个较为民主的政府，那么美国在其他地方的本钱就会增加。”周刊说，“美国将高兴看到（南朝鲜）民主党上台。该党的国内外政策绝大部分同李（承晚）的自由党一样，而且它将继续同美国合作”。但是它担心民主党不能控制局势，它并且对美国一手扶植起来的南朝鲜军人表示巨大兴趣，说，“也许现在在（南）朝鲜政局中最重要的因素就是宋尧赞将军指挥下的陆军”，“陆军大概将成为组成的任何政府的主要支柱”。
    据新华社1日讯　华盛顿消息：美国资产阶级记者约瑟夫·艾尔索普4月27日在“华盛顿邮报”上发表一篇文章，担心南朝鲜人民反抗李承晚集团法西斯统治的英勇斗争，将是“一个不应忽视的风暴的预告”，预示着美国在亚洲的其他一些傀儡政权将遭受同样的命运。
    艾尔索普在这篇题为“亚洲的雷云”的文章里说，南朝鲜“发生大爆发的教训”是，艾森豪威尔政府在亚洲扶植的傀儡政权“决不是一向看来的那么稳定”。他承认，凡是美国扶植有傀儡政权的地方，那里就“总是出现”“政治腐败的趋向”。南朝鲜的“爆发”就是“政治腐败的结果”。艾尔索普认为，“（南）朝鲜的这次爆发，是一个不可忽视的风暴的预告。”他说，这件事情应该使美国“注意有点类似的南越局势”。
    艾尔索普指出，“今天南越的政府几乎是家族政府，这种情况促使当地无法出现生气勃勃的政治生活。”他指出了遍及南越各地的人民反抗吴庭艳政权的斗争。他认为，虽然南越的局势“还没有达到尖锐的程度，但是已经相当的糟。”
    艾尔索普认为，为美国所扶植的老挝萨纳尼空政权和台湾的蒋介石集团也都面临着不妙的前景。
