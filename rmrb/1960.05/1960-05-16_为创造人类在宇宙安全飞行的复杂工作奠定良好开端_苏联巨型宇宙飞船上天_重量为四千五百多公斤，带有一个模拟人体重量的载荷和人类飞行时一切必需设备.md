Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 15th: TASS Moscow, May 15th: TASS Communique:

In recent years, the Soviet Union has been continuously conducting scientific research and experimental design work to prepare for human flight into outer space.

The achievements of the Soviet Union in building artificial Earth satellites of great weight and volume, and the successful testing of powerful carrier rockets capable of bringing satellites weighing several tons into predetermined orbits, have made it possible to build and begin testing manned spacecraft for long-term flights in outer space.

On May 15, 1960, the Soviet Union launched a spaceship into Earth satellite orbit. According to materials already obtained, this satellite-type spaceship has entered an approximately circular orbit about 320 kilometers above the ground, according to calculations, after which it separated from the last stage of the carrier rocket. The initial cycle of operation of the Earth satellite-type spaceship is 91 minutes. The inclination of its orbit to the equatorial plane is equal to 65 degrees. The weight of the satellite-type spaceship, excluding the last stage of the carrier rocket, is 4,540 kilograms. A sealed cabin is installed on the satellite-type spaceship, carrying a payload simulating human weight and all the necessary equipment needed for future manned flights. In addition, the satellite-type spaceship also carries various instruments, the instruments together with the energy source weighing 1,477 kilograms.

This launch is to study and check the various systems of the satellite-type spaceship that ensure its safe flight and control, return to Earth, and the conditions necessary for humans during flight. This launch lays the foundation for the complex task of manufacturing reliable spacecraft that ensure safe human flight in space.

After the necessary materials have been collected from the satellite-type spaceship, the sealed cabin weighing approximately two and a half tons will detach from the satellite-type spaceship. This launch does not foresee the sealed cabin returning to the ground. After the reliability of its functions has been verified, and after detaching from the satellite-type spaceship, the sealed cabin, like the satellite-type spaceship, will begin to descend according to ground commands and will be destroyed upon entering the dense atmosphere.

The satellite-type spaceship is equipped with a "Signal" transmitter with a frequency of 19.995 megahertz, which can transmit signals in both telephone and telegraph form.

In addition to the "Signal" transmitter, the satellite-type spaceship is also equipped with special radio equipment that transmits materials about the operating conditions of the installed instruments to the ground and accurately measures orbital parameters. The power supply for the scientific and measuring instruments on the satellite-type spaceship is provided by chemical batteries and solar batteries.

The results of the preliminary processing of the materials obtained from the satellite-type spaceship show that the instruments installed on it are working normally. Ground stations are conducting systematic observations of the satellite-type spaceship's situation.

At 6:11 AM, the satellite-type spaceship had already flown over Moscow.

At 7:38 AM (Moscow time), the Soviet satellite-type spaceship will fly over Paris, at 7:43 AM the satellite-type spaceship will fly over Leningrad, and at 10:36 AM Moscow time the satellite-type spaceship will fly over New York.

At 9:12 PM on May 15th, this satellite-type spaceship may be observed with the naked eye in the Vladivostok area from a south to east direction.

    为创造人类在宇宙安全飞行的复杂工作奠定良好
    开端苏联巨型宇宙飞船上天
    重量为四千五百多公斤，带有一个模拟人体重量的载荷和人类飞行时一切必需设备
    新华社莫斯科15日电　塔斯社莫斯科15日电：塔斯社公报：
    最近几年内，苏联不断地在进行科学研究和实验设计工作，以准备人飞往宇宙空间。
    苏联在建造重量和体积都很大的地球人造卫星方面取得的成就以及能够把几吨重的卫星带到预定的轨道上去的强大运载火箭的试验成功，使得有可能去建造和开始试验在宇宙空间长时间飞行用的载人宇宙飞船。
    1960年5月15日，苏联按地球卫星轨道发射了一个宇宙飞船。据已经得到的材料，这个卫星式飞船已根据计算进入了离地面大约三百二十公里的接近圆形的轨道，在这以后便脱离了运载火箭的最后一级。地球卫星式飞船的最初运转周期为九十一分钟。它的轨道同赤道平面的倾斜度等于六十五度。卫星式飞船的重量不算运载火箭的最后一级为四千五百四十公斤。在卫星式飞船上安装有密封舱，密封舱带有一个模拟人体重量的载荷并且带有为将来载人飞行所需要的一切必要设备，此外，卫星式飞船上还带有各种仪器，仪器连同能源的重量为一千四百七十七公斤。
    这次发射是为了研究和检查卫星式飞船的那些保证它安全飞行和控制飞行、返回地球和人在飞行中所必要的条件的各种系统。这次发射奠定了制造保证人在宇宙中安全飞行的可靠的宇宙飞船的复杂工作的开端。
    在从卫星式飞船上收得了必需的材料之后，约两吨半重的密封舱将脱离卫星式飞船。这次发射中没有预定密封舱要回到地面，密封舱在其功能的可靠性得到检验后和在脱离卫星式飞船后，同卫星式飞船一样，将根据地上的命令开始下降，并且在进入稠密大气层时陨灭。
    卫星式飞船上安装了“信号”发射机，频率为一九点九九五兆周，它既可以电话形式，也可以电报形式传送信号。
    除了“信号”发射机以外，卫星式飞船上还安装有专门无线电装置。把关于所安装的仪器的工作情况材料发射到地面，并且准确测量轨道参数，在卫星式飞船上的科学和测量仪器的电源是由化学电池和太阳能电池供应的。
    从卫星式飞船上获得的初步的材料整理的结果表明，它上面所安装的仪器工作正常。地面站在对卫星式飞船的情况进行有系统的观测。
    六时十一分卫星式飞船已飞过莫斯科上空。
    七时三十八分（莫斯科时间）苏联卫星式飞船将飞过巴黎上空，七时四十三分卫星式飞船将飞过列宁格勒上空，莫斯科时间十时三十六分卫星式飞船将飞过纽约上空。
    5月15日二十一时十二分，在海参崴地区可能从南到东的方向用肉眼观测到这个卫星式飞船。
