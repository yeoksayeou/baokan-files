Xinhua News Agency, 24th: Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Dalian, Xiamen and other places held rallies to commemorate the third anniversary of the patriotic anti-American demonstration by the people of Taiwan on May 24th. Those present at the meetings angrily denounced the towering crimes committed by American imperialism in Taiwan, and believed that the compatriots in Taiwan must unite with the people on the mainland to vow to drive the American robbers out of Taiwan.

The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) convened a meeting on the 23rd to commemorate "May 24th". More than 200 people attended the meeting, including Taiwan compatriots in Shanghai and people from all walks of life in Shanghai. Zhao Zukang, Vice Mayor of Shanghai, Standing Committee Member of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPPCC, and Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, presided over the meeting. He said that the "May 24th" anti-American incident showed that the Chinese people, including the people of Taiwan, are inviolable. Now American imperialism is surrounded by volcanoes. In this excellent situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind, let us intensify our work and contribute to the early liberation of Taiwan. Xue Dubi, a member of the National Committee of the CPPCC (who served as the Minister of Water Conservancy of the Kuomintang government before liberation), said that as long as the American robbers do not get out of Taiwan, the disaster of the Taiwan compatriots cannot be eliminated for a single day. Now, in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the roar of "Yankee go home" has been heard everywhere, and the life of American imperialism will not be long. Jia Yibin, a member of the National Committee of the CPPCC (an uprising general, former acting director of the Reserve Cadre Bureau of the Kuomintang Ministry of National Defense), pointed out that the anti-American patriotic struggles of the people all over the world are strong support for the people of Taiwan. He said: Dear compatriots in Taiwan, the people of the motherland are supporting you, and the people of the whole world are supporting you. Let us unite and work together to drive American imperialism out of Taiwan. Xie Xuetang, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Branch of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, said at the meeting that the people of Taiwan must unite with the people of the motherland and the people of the world to fight to the end to overthrow American imperialism and liberate Taiwan.

Members of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League and Taiwan compatriots in Tianjin held a meeting on the afternoon of the 23rd. Chen Jinjie, a member of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League in Tianjin, said with indignation: American imperialism has occupied Taiwan for more than ten years, and there have been countless robber acts like the killing of Liu Ziran. The people of Taiwan have been living a miserable life worse than cattle and horses. Chen Jinjie said that because American robbers occupied my hometown of Taiwan, my flesh and blood were separated, and I didn’t even know if my seventy-year-old mother was alive or dead. Speaking of this, he said with incomparable anger that if American imperialism does not get out of Taiwan for a single day, our Taiwan compatriots and the people of the whole country will not give up for a single day. Chen Yuyi, a Taiwan compatriot and cadre of the Tianjin Catering Welfare Company who participated in the "February 28th Uprising" struggle, said that the people of Taiwan, who have a tradition of anti-imperialist struggle, will not be conquered. They will follow the path taken by the people of the motherland and drive the American invaders out of Taiwan, just like driving the American aggressors out of the mainland. Liao Canhui, Chairman of the Tianjin Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese and a Taiwan compatriot, said that American imperialism has committed all kinds of evils in Taiwan, and we will not give up until we settle this account with American imperialism.

Taiwan compatriots in Guangzhou held a meeting on the evening of the 23rd, resolutely demanding that the American robbers get out of Taiwan. Lin Donghai, Chairman of the Guangzhou Municipal Branch of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, said that in the past three years, the anti-American sentiment of Taiwan compatriots has been rising, and the anti-American struggle is surging forward. Recently, the storm of the people all over the world opposing American imperialism and its running dogs has become more and more fierce, which is very beneficial to the anti-American struggle of the people of Taiwan. Chen Wenlan, a Taiwan compatriot and engineer of the Guangzhou Chemical Plant, said that in the unprecedentedly favorable situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind, as long as we persist in the struggle, we will definitely be able to drive American imperialism out of Taiwan.

Taiwan compatriots living in Dalian City held a meeting on the evening of the 23rd. Chen Wen, Chairman of the Dalian Municipal Branch of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, said that the patriotic and anti-American just struggle of the people of Taiwan is not isolated. The people of Taiwan first have the powerful socialist motherland as their backing, as well as the support of socialist countries and the people of the whole world. Taiwan must return to the embrace of the motherland.

Taiwan compatriots in Xiamen City held a meeting on the evening of the 22nd, unanimously resolutely opposing the American imperialist conspiracy to create "two Chinas," and expressed their determination to fight to the end for the liberation of Taiwan together with the people of the whole country.
