Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, May 27th: Mongolian Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Tsendenbal, hosted a luncheon today in honor of Premier Zhou Enlai.

Vice Premier Chen Yi, all the Chinese comrades accompanying Premier Zhou, and Chinese Ambassador to Mongolia, Xie Fusheng, were invited to attend the banquet.

Mongolian party and government leaders S. Luvsan, J. Zhamyan, Molomjamts, Dugersuren, Jagvaral, Maydar, Lhamsuren, Foreign Minister Shagdarjav, and Mongolian Ambassador to China, Sharav, were present at the banquet.

Chairman Tsendenbal delivered a speech during the banquet, warmly welcoming the Chinese guests. He said that the visit of the distinguished Chinese guests made the Mongolian people as happy as if they were celebrating a festival. He said that the friendship between our two countries is becoming more and more consolidated every year, and the cooperation between our two countries will be further developed in the future. He also expressed his heartfelt thanks to the Chinese Party, government, and people for China's fraternal assistance to Mongolia. He proposed a toast to the further consolidation and development of the cause of Mongolian-Chinese friendship and cooperation.

Premier Zhou Enlai then delivered a speech, once again expressing his gratitude to the hosts for their grand welcome. He said that such a grand welcome expresses the deep friendship between the Chinese and Mongolian peoples, which we will never forget.

Premier Zhou said that China's assistance to Mongolia is limited. Premier Zhou hoped that this visit would help the development of friendship between the two countries, and proposed a toast to the eternal friendship between China and Mongolia.

Chairman Tsendenbal once again delivered a speech, saying that Mongolia's great neighbors, the Soviet Union and China, have always fought to safeguard world peace, and the Soviet Union and China are the main pillars of the socialist camp. He wished the Soviet and Chinese people greater achievements in defending world peace and in construction endeavors.

Vice Premier Chen Yi also raised his glass to speak. He said that the great Soviet Union has always been the leader of the socialist camp, and it has consistently helped socialist countries in their socialist construction. He pointed out that the Soviet Union's recent steps to ease international tensions and its stern stance against the provocations of the United States and the sabotage of the four-nation summit conference were completely correct, and the Chinese Party, government, and people expressed their full support for this.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that the Chinese people have always stood firmly with the people of the Soviet Union, Mongolia, and other socialist countries in resolutely opposing the war policy of U.S. imperialism. The imperialists' attempts to split the socialist camp countries are bound to be met with shameful failure. He said that the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union loves peace. If the imperialists dare to launch an attack on the socialist camp, they will be completely crushed.

Chairman Tsendenbal, Premier Zhou Enlai, and Vice Premier Chen Yi's words were warmly welcomed.

During the banquet, the guests repeatedly toasted to the strength and unity of the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union and to the health of the leaders of China and Mongolia.
