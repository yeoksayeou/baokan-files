Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, May 21st: Prenatal fetal protection, postnatal infant protection. Zhejiang is vigorously establishing and improving the feeding management system to welcome the large-scale birth of young livestock from spring-mated pregnant animals.

Zhejiang Province has done a very good job in the spring mating of female livestock this year. More than 80% of the eligible sows and most of the eligible cows in the province are pregnant. Many counties such as Rui'an, Jinhua, Jiande, Yueqing, and Jiaxing have also achieved full mating and full pregnancy. In order to ensure that spring-mated pregnant livestock are fully productive and fully alive, the province has recently launched a "five-full" high-yield campaign centered on sow pregnancy, namely, full mating, full pregnancy, full birth, full survival, and full growth.

At present, collective livestock farms in many communes and production teams in Zhejiang have established pregnant livestock cards and files to accurately grasp the mating period and production period of pregnant livestock. Various places have also universally established a "three-prevention" system to prevent premature birth, prevent miscarriage, and prevent difficult labor. The livestock farms of communes and production teams in Jiande County have designated special personnel to take care of pregnant livestock during pregnancy and to administer local soil medicines such as husk juice, cogon grass root soup, and ramie root soup to pregnant female livestock for fetal protection, with good results.

Now, the breeders of collective livestock farms in various communes are trying their best to feed pregnant female livestock well and ensure cleanliness and hygiene. Many livestock farms have also prepared "pig quilts" and established "pig maternity wards" for pregnant female livestock to prepare for childbirth, so that pregnant female livestock can give birth to all live piglets.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, May 21st: Wenjiang Prefecture in Sichuan Province strengthens the work of protecting fetuses and ensuring production for pregnant pigs to ensure that piglets are fully born, fully alive, and fully healthy. Through the mating campaign last winter and this spring, nearly 200,000 eligible sows in the Wenjiang area have basically achieved full mating and full pregnancy. Since most of these sows were mated using advanced methods, the general piglet production rate is relatively high. It is estimated that more than one million piglets will be born in the district in the second quarter of this year. Therefore, doing a good job in the pre-natal care of pregnant pigs and welcoming the birth of piglets is of great significance for realizing a great leap forward in pig production.

Now, many counties and communes have fixed special personnel to be responsible for strengthening the leadership of this work, and some counties have also trained feeders in batches to impart knowledge of feeding management and nursing piglets during the pregnancy and production of sows. Various places have also generally adjusted and repaired pig pens, basically achieving one pen per sow.

Various places pay special attention to the nutrition of sows during pregnancy and production, and generally add concentrate feed to make sows fat before giving birth and produce more milk after giving birth. Guanxian, Pengxian and other places also increase bone meal to pregnant pigs to meet the calcium needs of piglets growing in the sow's body and avoid stillbirths. In addition, feeders in many places have also established a "three-guarantee" responsibility system to guarantee full birth, full survival, and full growth. Many communes in Pixian County have also made a large number of piglet protection boxes to prevent piglets from being squeezed.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, May 21st: The pig industry in Xiangtan Prefecture, Hunan Province is launching a fetal protection and infant rearing movement with the purpose of full production, full survival, and full growth, and focusing on improving feeding management.

This spring, while breaking the "conventional" decline in the number of pigs in spring in previous years, the area also vigorously promoted spring mating. In the first quarter, 350,000 sows in the district became pregnant. Now, the production period of these pregnant pigs is approaching. Calculating that each sow produces an average of seven piglets per litter, the number of piglets born in the district in May, June and July is approximately equal to the total number of pigs currently existing.

In order to avoid miscarriage and stillbirth in pregnant pigs, and diseases and death in piglets, and to change the situation where one or two piglets die in each litter of ordinary sows in the past, the Xiangtan Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that doing a good job in fetal protection and infant rearing is an outstanding and important link in the current development of pig production. Therefore, it is required that no pregnant pig should miscarry in various places, and efforts should be made to make every piglet healthy. At present, cadres at all levels in the Xiangtan area who manage livestock production are going deep into sow farms. First, they are targeting the right-leaning and negative thinking of some people who believe that miscarriage of sows is common and that the death of piglets is difficult to avoid. They summarize and promote the experience of a number of red flag units with safe sow births and high piglet survival rates. At the same time, they adopt the method of comparative accounting to improve ideological understanding. On the basis of improving understanding and promoting experience, all localities have conscientiously strengthened a series of fetal protection and infant rearing measures such as feeding management. All sow farms universally implement a dedicated single-pen management system, selecting commune members with high ideological awareness and experience in raising sows to raise sows, so that breeders are familiar with the habits of sows and can more accurately grasp the production period and master the sow's food intake. Pregnant pigs in various places have also taken fetal protection drugs and galactagogues.

    产前保胎　产后保仔
    浙江改进饲养管理制度迎接仔猪降生 
    温江、湘潭两专区加强保胎育仔工作
    新华社杭州21日电　产前保胎、产后保仔，浙江大力建立和健全饲养管理制度，迎接春配满怀母畜大批降生仔畜。
    浙江省今年的母畜春配工作做得很好，全省80％以上的适龄母猪和大部分适龄母牛都怀了胎；瑞安、金华、建德、乐清、嘉兴等许多县还达到全配满怀。为了确保春配孕畜全产全活，这个省最近广泛开展了以母猪满怀为中心全配、全孕、全生、全活、全壮的“五全”高产运动。
    目前，浙江各地许多公社、生产队的集体畜牧场都建立有孕畜卡片和档案，以便正确掌握孕畜配种期、生产期。各地还普遍建立起了防早产、防流产、防难产的
  “三防”制度。建德县各公社和生产队畜牧场确定专人做好母畜怀胎期的护理、给怀孕母畜服用苞衣汁、茅草、根汤、苧麻根汤等保胎土药，效果很好。
    现在各公社集体畜牧场的饲养员们，都在千方百计给怀胎母畜吃饱吃好，做到清洁卫生。许多畜牧场为了怀胎的母畜临产准备，还做了“猪被”和建立“猪产院”等，使怀胎母畜产仔全生全活。
    新华社成都21日电　四川温江专区加强孕猪护胎保产工作，保证仔猪全生全活全壮。经过去冬今春的配种运动，温江地区近二十万头适龄母猪基本实现了全配满怀。由于这批母猪大部分采用先进方法配种，一般产仔猪率较高，预计今年第二季度全区将有一百多万只仔猪降生。因此，做好孕猪产前护养和迎接仔猪降生工作对实现生猪大跃进有着重大意义。
    现在，许多县和公社都固定了专人负责，加强这一工作的领导，有的县还分批轮训了饲养员，传授母猪孕期产期的饲养管理和护养仔猪的知识。各地还普遍调整修补了猪圈，基本上做到了一只母猪一个圈。
    各地特别注意母猪孕期、产期的营养，普遍加喂精料。使母猪产前肥壮、产后奶多。灌县、彭县等地还给孕猪增饲骨粉，以适应仔猪在母猪体内生长的钙质需要，避免死胎。此外许多地方的饲养员还建立了包全生、包全活、包全壮的“三包”责任制。郫县许多公社还大量赶制了仔猪保护箱，防止仔猪挤伤。
    据新华社长沙21日电　湖南湘潭专区的养猪业正在开展一个以全产、全活、全壮为目的，以改善饲养管理为中心的保胎育仔运动。
    今年春天，这个地区在打破历年春季养猪头数下降“常规”的同时，还大抓春配，全区第一季度就有三十五万头母猪怀了胎。现在，这些孕猪的产期已近，以母猪每胎平均产仔七头计算，全区五、六、七三个月降生的小猪约等于现有猪只的总数。
    为了避免孕猪不流产、不死胎，仔猪不病、不死，改变过去一般母猪每胎死仔一、两头的情况，中共湘潭地委认为作好保胎育仔工作，是当前发展生猪生产中一个突出的重要环节，因此，要求各地要做到孕猪一头不流产，仔猪力争头头健壮。目前，湘潭地区各级管理畜牧生产的干部，正纷纷深入母猪场，他们首先针对部分人认为母猪流产是常有的事，仔猪死亡很难免的右倾消极思想，总结推广一批母猪产仔安全、仔猪成活率高的红旗单位的经验，同时，采取对比算账的办法，提高思想认识。在提高认识、推广经验的基础上，各地都认真加强了饲养管理等一系列的保胎育仔措施。各个母猪场普遍推行专人单栏管理，挑选思想觉悟高，又有养母猪经验的社员饲养母猪，以便饲养员熟悉母猪习性，比较准确的掌握产仔期，掌握母猪食量。各地的孕猪还都服用了安胎药，催奶剂。
