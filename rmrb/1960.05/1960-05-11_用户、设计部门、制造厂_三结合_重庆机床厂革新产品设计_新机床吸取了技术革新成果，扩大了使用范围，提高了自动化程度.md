User, Design Department, and Manufacturing Plant "Three-Way Combination"
Chongqing Machine Tool Plant Reforms Product Design
New machine tools absorb the achievements of technical innovation, expand the scope of use, and improve the degree of automation

(Reported by our newspaper) The Chongqing Machine Tool Plant has adopted the method of "three-way combination" of user departments, design departments, and manufacturing departments, concentrating the achievements of the three parties in carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution, improving the scope of product use, and increasing the degree of product automation, satisfying users, manufacturers, and designers.

The Chongqing Machine Tool Plant is a major factory in China producing gear hobbing machines. With the continued deepening of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, many users urgently need to expand the scope of machine tool use and improve the degree of automation. This requires factories producing machine tools to carry out a thorough reform from the fundamental link—the entire structural design of the product. Based on this situation, the factory promptly organized "user visiting teams," issued questionnaires to solicit user opinions and requirements, and collected information and data on product innovation from users during the "Four Transformations" (mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, semi-automation) movement. Then, the factory Party committee immediately led veteran workers and technical personnel in design and manufacturing to analyze comprehensively, and adopted the method of side-by-side airing of views, side-by-side determination of plans, and side-by-side review of designs, to contribute ideas and suggestions for improvement. So far, remarkable results have been achieved. For example, a newly designed machine tool has achieved full automation, increasing efficiency by 30% to 40%, changing from one person watching one machine in the past to one person watching four machines.

Another practice of the factory in implementing the "three-way combination" is to organize representatives from users, design, and manufacturing to hold discussion meetings, repeatedly conduct airing of views and debates, and specifically solve many problems in the design. The experience of the Chongqing Machine Tool Plant proves that the design, manufacturing, and user sides have different opinions and requirements for the product due to their different positions. Repeated debates among the three parties enable the design of the new product to first meet the user's requirements, while also taking into account the characteristics of production and the convenience of design. For example, when the factory was discussing whether to use triangular guide rails or rectangular guide rails in the design of a gear hobbing machine, there was a conflict between the user and the producer. The user requested the use of triangular guide rails, which have good guiding properties and are convenient to use; the producer advocated using rectangular guide rails because they are easier to process and have higher efficiency. After repeated airing of views and debates, and careful consideration of the user's opinions, it was decided to use triangular guide rails where they should be used, and the bed and column could be changed to rectangular guide rails where triangular guide rails are not necessary. As a result, all three parties were satisfied.

In order to ensure that design modifications are carried out in a planned manner and that the designed and manufactured products are more perfect and more adapted to the requirements of the current development of the technical revolution movement, the Chongqing Machine Tool Plant has divided the improvement of product design into two steps. The first step is to modify without affecting production; the second step is to completely overhaul and replace the models currently in production with newly designed models. In the first step of modifying the design, the factory classified and sorted all the parts of various products, merged those that should be merged, generalized those that should be generalized, and used standard parts where possible. Moreover, twenty-eight major improvements were made to a gear hobbing machine with the largest current production volume. In the second step of thorough improvement and design work, the factory redesigned two different models of gear hobbing machines, accounting for 70% of this year's production, according to the requirements of parts standardization, component generalization, structure simplification, and performance automation. According to preliminary plans, the common parts of the two improved products will be increased from the original 9% to 82%, which is more adapted to the characteristics of automated production lines. Among them, the rigidity of one type of gear hobbing machine has been greatly improved, and the scope of use has been expanded. The maximum module of gears that can be processed by this machine can now be increased from six millimeters to eight millimeters, and the width of gears that can be processed can also be increased from two hundred and fifty millimeters to three hundred millimeters. At the same time, costs can be reduced by more than 10%, raw materials can be saved by 10%, labor hours can be saved by about 34%, and many favorable conditions can be created for management work.

### 用户、设计部门、制造厂“三结合”  重庆机床厂革新产品设计  新机床吸取了技术革新成果，扩大了使用范围，提高了自动化程度

    用户、设计部门、制造厂“三结合”
    重庆机床厂革新产品设计
    新机床吸取了技术革新成果，扩大了使用范围，提高了自动化程度
    本报讯　重庆机床厂采取使用部门、设计部门和制造部门“三结合”的办法，集中了三方面大闹技术革新和技术革命的成就，改进产品的使用范围，提高产品自动化程度，使用户、制造者、设计者三方面都满意。
    重庆机床厂是我国生产齿轮机床的主要工厂。随着技术革新和技术革命运动的继续深入发展，许多用户急切需要扩大机床使用范围和提高自动化程度。这就要求生产机床的工厂从根本的一环——产品的整个结构设计来进行彻底的改革。根据这个情况，这个厂及时组织了“用户访问队”，印发了征求用户意见书，广泛征求用户的意见和要求，并收集“四化”（机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化）运动中用户对产品革新的情况和资料。然后，工厂党委又立即领导老工人和设计、制造的技术人员一道综合分析，并采用边鸣放、边定方案、边审查设计的办法，献计献策进行改进。到目前为止，已经取得了很显著的成绩。譬如，新设计的一种机床，全部达到自动化，效率提高30％到40％，由过去一人看一台，提高到一人看四台。 
    这个厂实行“三结合”的另一作法是组织用户、设计、制造三方面的代表开座谈会，反复进行鸣放辩论，具体解决设计当中的许多问题。重庆机床厂的经验证明，设计、制造、用户三方面，由于他们所处的地位不同，对产品各有不同的意见和要求，三方面反复辩论，就使新产品的设计既能首先满足用户的要求，又能照顾到生产的特点和设计的方便。例如，这个厂在讨论一种齿轮机设计方案采用三角导轨好还是矩形导轨好的问题时，用户和生产者就有矛盾，用户要求使用三角导轨，这种导轨导向性好，用起来方便；生产者则主张用矩形导轨，因为加工方便和效率高，经过反复鸣放辩论，并慎重考虑了用户意见，决定该用三角导轨的地方就用三角导轨，床身、立柱可以不用三角导轨，改用矩形导轨，结果三方面都很满意。
    重庆机床厂为使修改设计有计划地进行，又使设计、制造的产品更为完善，更加适应当前技术革命运动发展的要求，这个厂把改进产品设计分作两步走。第一步是在不影响生产的情况下改；第二步是彻底大改，用设计出的新型号代替正在生产的型号。在第一步修改设计中，这个厂将各种产品全部零件进行了分类排队，该合并的合并了，该通用的改通用，可以改标准件的改用标准件，而且对当前生产批量最大的一种齿轮机床进行了二十八项较大的改进。在第二步的彻底改进设计工作方面，这个厂把占今年生产量70％的两种不同型号的齿轮机床根据零件标准化、部件通用化、结构简单化、性能自动化的要求，重新设计。根据初步方案，改进后两种产品的通用件，由原来的9％提高到82％，这样就更适应了自动线生产的特点。其中有一种齿轮机床的刚性能比原来大大提高，使用范围扩大，这种机床现在加工齿轮的最大模数可由六毫米提高到八毫米，加工齿轮的宽度也可由二百五十毫米提高到三百毫米。同时，成本可以降低10％以上，节约原材料10％，节省工时34％左右，并给管理工作创造了许多有利的条件。
