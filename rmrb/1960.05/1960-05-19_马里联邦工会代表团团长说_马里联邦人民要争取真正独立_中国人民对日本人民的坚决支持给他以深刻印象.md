Xinhua News Agency, 18th dispatch: N'do Amadou Koumba, head of the Mali Federation Trade Union delegation and administrative and economic secretary of the Mali Federation Trade Union, who is currently visiting our country, told our reporter on the 17th that the people of the Mali Federation are determined to strive for complete and genuine independence. No matter what tricks the imperialists play, the people of the Mali Federation must carry the struggle for independence through to the end.

N'do said when meeting with our reporter on the afternoon of the 17th that after more than 100 years of struggle, the people of the Mali Federation finally forced the French colonialists to agree to the Mali Federation's independence in 1960. "But what the colonialists gave us was not genuine independence, but an attempt to retain their privileges in the four areas of defense, diplomacy, finance, and higher education. The people of the Mali Federation know that their independence means obtaining all powers, including these four."

N'do said that the workers of the Mali Federation had lived a painful life of hunger, cold, and job insecurity under the oppression of imperialism, and they had carried out many strikes to demand improved working conditions and strive for national independence.

Talking about his visit to China, N'do said that the grand rally of the Chinese people supporting the Japanese people's struggle left him with a very deep impression. "The meeting showed the Chinese people's firm support for the Japanese people who are fighting heroically. Both I personally and our delegation unconditionally agree with this."

He said that after returning to his country, he will convey to the people of the Mali Federation the contents of the joint declaration of the Chinese, Japanese, and Korean trade union organizations and the situation of the struggle being waged by the Japanese people. "I believe that our people will also launch a struggle to support the Japanese people, because they hope that the people of other countries can live a happy life."

N'do said: "In every place we visited, we saw Chinese workers and farmers working enthusiastically for their motherland. We saw the brilliant achievements of Chinese construction everywhere.

"And when we looked for the reasons for all these miracles, the answer we got was: this is the result of the Great Leap Forward achieved by implementing the general line formulated by Chairman Mao Zedong."

N'do said that due to having suffered long-term oppression by imperialism together, the people of the Mali Federation are enthusiastically concerned about everything that happens in China. And during his visit to China, he also felt the deep friendship between the Chinese working class and the Mali Federation working class at all times.

    马里联邦工会代表团团长说
    马里联邦人民要争取真正独立
    中国人民对日本人民的坚决支持给他以深刻印象
    新华社18日讯　正在我国访问的马里联邦工会代表团团长、马里联邦工会行政、经济书记恩多·阿玛杜·库姆巴17日对本社记者说：马里联邦人民决心争取完全的、真正的独立。不管帝国主义玩弄什么手法，马里联邦人民一定要将争取独立的斗争进行到底。
    恩多17日下午接见本社记者时说，马里联邦人民经过一百多年的斗争，最后迫使法国殖民主义者同意马里联邦在1960年独立。“但殖民主义者给予我们的并不是真正的独立，而是企图保留他们在国防、外交、财政和高等教育这四个方面的特权。马里联邦人民知道，他们的独立是要取得一切权力，包括这四种权力在内。”
    恩多说，马里联邦的工人曾经在帝国主义的压迫下过着饥寒交迫和职业毫无保障的痛苦生活，他们曾经进行过多次罢工来要求改善劳动条件和争取民族独立。
    谈到他在中国的访问时，恩多说，中国人民支持日本人民斗争的盛大集会给他以极深刻的印象。“会场上表现了中国人民对正在英勇斗争的日本人民的坚决支持。无论我个人和我们代表团对这都无条件地同意。”
    他说，他在回国后将向马里联邦人民传达中、日、朝工会组织联合宣言的内容和日本人民正在进行着的斗争的情况。“我相信，我国人民也将发起一个支持日本人民的斗争，因为他们希望别国人民能够过着幸福的生活。”
    恩多说：“在我们访问的每一个地方，我们都看到中国工人、农民在干劲冲天地为祖国工作着。我们到处都看到中国建设的辉煌成就。
      “而当我们寻找这一切奇迹所以产生的原因时，我们所得到的答案是：这是由于执行了毛泽东主席所制定的总路线而取得了大跃进的结果。”
    恩多说，由于共同受过帝国主义的长期压迫，马里联邦人民都热情地关怀着中国所发生的一切。而他在中国访问期间，也时时感受到中国工人阶级和马里联邦工人阶级之间的深厚友情。
