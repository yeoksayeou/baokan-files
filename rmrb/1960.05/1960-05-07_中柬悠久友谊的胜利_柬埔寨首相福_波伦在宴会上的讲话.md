Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, 6th. Cambodian Prime Minister Phou Proeung delivered a speech at a grand state banquet in honor of Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai. The full text is as follows:

Your Highness, please allow us to express our deepest and most respectful thanks to Your Royal Highness for agreeing to grace this grand banquet held by the Royal Government in your most noble capacity to welcome our distinguished guest and his esteemed collaborators.

Prime Minister, it is a precious opportunity for me and the members of the Royal Government to welcome you tonight, the esteemed representative of the great People's Republic of China and one of the most representative figures of the new Asia.

You are not only one of the most prominent symbols of China's unification and independence, but you belong to that type of person who, through outstanding action and lofty ideals, has undeniably influenced the history of their nation and perhaps even the world.

You have not only endured hardships and fought for the freedom of your country, but after unification was achieved, you also put forward an economic and social system based on the concepts of morality and labor, thereby rapidly ensuring the prosperity and welfare of the nation.

Prime Minister, your visit is a brilliant testament to the deep friendship that binds our two countries. Your visit is a new guarantee of the solidarity of your people, and also proves that the People's China sincerely hopes to contribute to the peaceful construction of Asian countries, regardless of their ideologies and systems.

Following the example of your great country, we are doing everything in our power to build and revitalize our national economy, in order to raise the living standards of our people and make their lives more in line with human dignity. In engaging in this cause, we need the sympathy and cooperation of all peoples, and in this respect, we place the Chinese nation in the foremost position, because their respect for us and the selfless economic assistance given to us is particularly valuable to us.

In today's chaotic world, the elements of peace and goodwill brought about by your courageous mission are, for those who are not blind, a major contribution to the future of all peoples on earth.

This is to explain to you how much we, a fundamentally peaceful country, admire the efforts you are undertaking so sincerely.

We sincerely believe that you will ultimately be victorious, and this will also be the victory of the long-standing friendship between China and Cambodia.

It is precisely because of this belief that, having obtained the permission of His Royal Highness Prince Norodom Sihanouk, who has always been our wise leader, I respectfully invite

Your Excellencies,

Gentlemen,

to toast to His Excellency Mr. Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the People's Republic of China,

to His Excellency Mr. Mao Zedong, the liberator of China and Chairman of the Communist Party of China,

Cheers!
