    Ode to the Great Hall of the People (Chorus brand tune)
   [Performed by the Beijing Delegation]
    Beijing Real Estate Management and Construction Company Zhao Qichang (Tune Head)
  The capital in October is beautiful,
  Heroes gather in the Great Hall,
  See the grand building towering,
  Above Tiananmen Square,
  Solemn, majestic, and resplendent. (Luo Jiang Rhyme)
  Light red granite base,
  Apricot yellow chiseled stone walls,
  Ten-meter-high glass eaves,
  Three-hundred-meter magnificent colonnade,
  Inlaid with a huge national emblem several feet high.
  Walking through the spacious central hall,
  Entering the magnificent ten-thousand-person hall,
  Above, the balconies look like two crescent moons,
    Surrounding the rostrum like the rising sun,
  Five hundred bright lights like stars filling the sky.
  In the very center, a red five-pointed star,
  Emitting rays of golden light,
  Sunflowers with gold-traced petals surrounding all sides,
  Symbolizing the Party is the guarantee of the people's victory. (Jinqian Lianhualuo)
  The Great Hall was completed in ten months, singing a song of triumph,
  The light of the General Line shines in all directions,
  Reflecting the boldness of the Great Leap Forward,
  Demonstrating the boundless strength of the working class's wisdom,
  Eighteen provinces and cities, twenty thousand workers fought day and night on the site,
  The achievements of ten months are extraordinary. (Da Xinchun)
  In the first month, digging earth,
  Native and foreign methods combined in the busy battle,
  Bulldozers roaring into action,
  Shovels flying and picks dancing, flashing silver light.
  In the second month, the north wind raging,
  The structural engineering is tense,
  Binding reinforcing steel bars in the wind and snow,
  Enthusiasm melts the snow and frost.
  In the third month, flowers fragrant,
  Concrete pouring tasks are busy,
  The mixer is like a singer releasing its throat,
  Labor songs shake the four directions.
  In the fourth month, hoisting steel beams,
  Heroes from all over gather together,
  Unfolding a battle for key projects,
  Soviet experts also come to help.
  In the fifth month, the days are long,
  The days are long but don't feel long,
  Fighting under the lights on the construction site,
  Ashamed, the moon hides in the clouds.
  In the sixth month, the sun is strong,
  Marble is inlaid on the wall,
  Quarried from Yunnan's Cangshan Mountain,
  Ten thousand miles is a long journey.
  In the seventh month, the rainy season is long,
  Torrential rain and lightning,
  Fighting in the rain on the site,
  Cross-operations are busy up and down.
  In the eighth month, the evening breeze is cool,
  Various equipment is cleverly installed,
  Forty-three elevators rise and fall together,
  Ventilation ducts are long and long.
  In the ninth month, chrysanthemums are yellow,
  Glazed eaves shine with golden light,
  Ten thousand flower lamps are bright,
  Painting and carving beams on suspended frames.
  In the tenth month, the scenery is good,
  National Day arrives with joy,
  The completion of the building sings a song of triumph,
  The achievements of ten months are extraordinary. (Qie Kuaishu)
  On the red square in front of Tiananmen,
  Stands the Great Hall of the People.
  Here, the People's Congress is convened,
  Taking responsibility for national affairs,
  Representing 600 million people looking forward to a grand plan,
  Sailing ten thousand miles, riding the wind and waves.
  Here, the Heroes' Conference is convened,
  Heroes from all over come from all directions,
  Presenting treasures and learning from experiences, spreading advanced seeds throughout the country,
  Red flowers blooming everywhere,
  A garden full of vibrant colors.
  Here, national leaders and the people raise
  their glasses in celebration at the state banquet,
  See today's leading figures gathering in the hall,
  Closely and happily together,
  Melting into a sea of happiness.
  Here, the masses cheer and sing praises to the Party,
  Holding high the three red flags, marching forward,
  "The East is Red" is sung by ten thousand people, the singing is loud and clear,
  Wishing our great leader Chairman Mao a long life!

    人民大会堂颂（群唱牌子曲）
   〔北京代表团演出〕    
    北京房管局修建公司　赵其昌（曲头）
  首都十月好风光，
  群英齐聚大会堂，
  见大厦巍峨耸立，
  天安门广场之上，
  庄严雄伟金碧辉煌。（罗江韵）
  浅红色花岗石基，
  杏黄色剁斧石墙，
  十米高玻璃屋檐，
  三百米壮阔的柱廊，
  镶嵌着巨大的国徽高数丈。
  穿过了宽敞的中央大厅，
  走进了宏伟的万人会堂，
  上边看挑台像两弯新月，
    围拱着主席台像初升的太阳，
  五百盏明灯似星辰布满在天空上。
  正中央红色的五星，
  闪放出束束金光，
  向日葵描金花瓣环绕四方，
  象征着党是人民胜利的保障。（金钱莲花落）
  大会堂十个月建成凯歌唱，
  总路线的光芒照四方，
  反映了大跃进的气势真豪放，
  显示了工人阶级智慧无穷力量强，
  十八个省市两万职工日夜奋战在现场上，
  十个月的战果不寻常。（打新春）
  正月里，挖土方，
  洋土结合战斗忙，
  推土机开动轰隆隆的响，
  锨飞锹舞闪银光。
  二月里，北风狂，
  结构工程正紧张，
  冒着风雪把钢筋绑，
  热情溶化雪和霜。
  三月里，百花香，
  混凝土浇灌任务忙，
  搅拌机像歌手把喉咙放，
  劳动歌声震四方。
  四月里，吊钢梁，
  各地英雄聚一堂，
  展开一场攻坚战，
  苏联专家也来帮忙。
  五月里，天气长，
  天气长也不觉长，
  挑灯夜战工地上，
  羞得月亮云内藏。
  六月里，烈日强，
  大理石把墙面镶，
  采石云南苍山上，
  万里迢迢路途长。
  七月里，雨季长，
  倾盆大雨闪电光，
  冒雨奋战现场上，
  交叉作业上下忙。
  八月里，晚风凉，
  各种设备巧安装，
  四十三部电梯齐升降，
  通风管道长又长。
  九月里，菊花黄，
  琉璃屋檐闪金光，
  万盏花灯多明亮，
  悬空架上画雕梁。
  十月里，好风光，
  国庆来到喜洋洋，
  大厦落成凯歌唱，
  十个月的战果不平常。（怯快书）
  天安门前红色广场上，
  矗立起人民自己的大会堂。
  在这里召开人民代表会，
  国家大事自己担当，
  代表着六亿人民把宏图展望，
  乘风破浪万里航。
  在这里召开群英会，
  各路英雄来四方，
  献宝取经把先进种子撒遍全国
  红花朵朵齐开放，
  万紫千红满园芳。
  在这里国家领导和人民群众举
  杯祝贺在国宴上，
  看今朝风流人物齐聚华堂，
  亲密无间同欢畅，
  融成一片幸福的海洋。
  在这里万众欢呼高歌颂党，
  高举起三面红旗奔向前方，
  “东方红”万人齐唱，歌声嘹亮，
  祝贺我们伟大的领袖毛主席万寿无疆！
