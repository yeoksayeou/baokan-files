    Fresh Feeling
    ——Seeing the Northeast Three Provinces Art Exhibition
    Hua Junwu
    The art associations of the three northeastern provinces have brought artworks from those provinces to Beijing for exhibition, which is the first time since the founding of the nation. Many people who saw this exhibition were very excited. Some said they had a fresh feeling after seeing it. These four characters ("fresh feeling") can comprehensively and appropriately describe the benefits of this exhibition, so I use it as the title.
    What's fresh about it? This is because a great many of the works artistically reflect the socialist construction of the three northeastern provinces and the spiritual outlook of the working masses since the Great Leap Forward. What stands out in the exhibition are many sets of paintings with the theme of industrial construction, such as "Ode to Anshan Iron and Steel," "Cable Workers Tackle Advanced Technology," "Leap Forward Flowers," "Chicken Feathers to the Sky," "Starting from Scratch," etc. From these paintings, we can see that the artists are not simply recording life in a flat way, nor are they focusing on portraying the technical processes of production, nor are they just painting "machines plus people." Their common feature is that they strive to display the workers' revolutionary drive and revolutionary pioneering spirit on the canvas. The painters have been very successful in shaping and portraying the images of the workers. The workers in these paintings are no longer images of intellectuals wearing worker's clothes; they are living, intelligent, and courageous worker images. Some say they are typical images of northeastern workers. From these sets of paintings, one can appreciate the authors' attempts to deeply express the workers' thoughts and feelings. The reason why these sets of paintings have achieved these accomplishments is precisely the result of the painters delving into the lives of the workers and peasants, and the result of changes in the painters' thoughts and feelings.
    The wide range of subjects also suffices to illustrate that the painters are striving to express the new things in the three northeastern provinces and to reflect all aspects of construction, from the lush forests of the Lesser Khingan Mountains and the Changbai Mountains and the vast scenery of the northern Manchurian grasslands, to the fishermen on the Songhua River and the Evenki people's forest nurseries, the Changchun First Automobile Works, which produced China's first automobile, and the magnificent open-pit coal mines, the snow-covered scenery of the northern country and the Songhua-Harbin Plains carrying the morning mist. From depicting the historical themes of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army's revolutionary struggle to the current vigorous technical revolution movement. Even in a natural landscape painting, the painters express their love and pride for those cultivated frozen lands, which is most clearly expressed in several prints depicting the eroticism of the northern Manchurian grasslands.
    What attracts our attention is the large number of new painters who have emerged, and many excellent works are even created by young students from art colleges. For example, "Starting from Scratch" was collectively created by students from the Fine Arts High School, whose average age is around eighteen; "Cable Workers Tackle Advanced Technology" is a collective creation of first-year students from the Chinese Painting Department of the Northeast Lu Xun Academy of Fine Arts. These all illustrate that under the correct leadership of the Party, new forces are growing rapidly. It is also the result of students breaking superstitions and establishing the courage to speak, think, and act. In the past, there was a dogma in the art world that student creations could not enter exhibitions, and students did not believe that they could create. Now that the old rules have been broken, students can create very good works with the help and guidance of their teachers. This was already illustrated last year when the faculty and students of the Sculpture Department of the Northeast Lu Xun Academy of Fine Arts collectively created two large round sculptures, "Long Live the People's Commune," for the Beijing Agricultural Exhibition Hall, which received unanimous praise from the society, and this is once again proven in this exhibition. It is said that some young students have become proud because of this, which is of course wrong, and we must strengthen their education. But this revolutionary approach will inevitably have a good influence and stimulating effect on many young art students across the country.
    If we talk about "fresh feeling," the above are the sources of the feeling.
    From the Northeast Art Exhibition, we can also see some existing problems. Although many works are successful, there are still some works that have naturalistic tendencies in reflecting life; some works are still at the stage of materials; artistic expression skills cannot yet freely express the painter's creative intentions, and some works appear to be artistically poor. There are also differences in the levels of various art forms in each province. Prints are more prominent in Heilongjiang than other painting genres in the province; the Chinese paintings and sculptures of Liaoning Province are more eye-catching; and the Chinese paintings and oil paintings of Jilin Province are also better than other works in the province. Compared to the three provinces, due to different development conditions, some are higher and some are lower. Through continuous exhibitions, mutual learning and observation, the lower ones will be rapidly improved, and the backward ones will reach the advanced level.
    The artists in Beijing held a symposium for this exhibition. No one spoke abstract compliments. Everyone believed that the Northeast Three Provinces Art Exhibition was a success. Artists and art school students in Beijing can learn from this exhibition and gain a lot of inspiration.

    新鲜感觉
    ——看东北三省美展
    华君武
    东北三省的美术家协会，把三省的美术作品送来北京展出，这是建国以来的第一次。很多人看了这个展览会都很兴奋，有人说看了这个展览会，有一种新鲜感觉，这四个字可以说概括地、恰当地说出了这个展览会的好处，因此我用它作了题目。
    新鲜在什么地方呢？这是因为其中有非常多的作品，艺术地反映了东北三省的社会主义建设，反映了大跃进以来工人群众的精神面貌。展览会中引人注目的是有许多以工业建设为主题的组画，如“鞍钢颂”、“电缆工人攻尖端”、“跃进之花”、“鸡毛上天”、“白手起家”等等，从这些画里，看出画家并不是平板地去纪录生活，不是去着重表现生产上的技术过程，也不只是画着“机器加人”；它们共同的特点是力图在画面上显示工人们的革命干劲和革命的首创精神。画家们在塑造、刻划工人的形象上是很成功的。这些画中的工人，已经不是穿上工人服、实际是知识分子的形象，他们是活生生的、充满着智慧和勇敢的工人形象，有人说就是东北工人的典型形象。从这些组画中可以体会出作者企图深入地去表现工人的思想感情，这些组画其所以取得这些成就正是画家们深入工农群众生活的结果，是画家们在思想情感上起了变化的结果。
    作品取材的广泛，也足以说明画家们在力求表现东北三省的新生事物，力求去反映建设的各个方面，从小兴安岭、长白山茂盛的森林和浩瀚的北满草原风光，松花江的渔民和鄂伦春族的林间托儿站，出产中国第一辆汽车的长春汽车厂和气魄宏伟的露天煤矿，白雪遍地的北国风光和带着早晨雾气的松哈平原。从描写抗联革命斗争的历史题材一直到当前蓬勃发展的技术革命运动。即使在一幅自然风景画里，画家们对于那些被开垦了的冻土，抒发了他们喜爱和自豪的情感，这在几幅表现北满草原情色的版画里是表现得再也明显不过了。
    引起我们注意的是许多新画家的大量出现，许多优秀的作品甚至是美术院校的青年学生创造的。例如“白手起家”就是美术附中的同学们集体创造的，他们的平均年龄是十八岁左右；“电缆工人攻尖端”就是东北鲁迅美术学院国画系一年级学生的集体创作。这些都说明了在党的正确领导下，新生力量在迅速成长起来。也是学生们打破迷信、树立起敢说敢想敢做的结果。过去美术界里有一种教条，认为学生创作不能进展览会，学生也不相信自己能够创作，现在清规被打破了，学生在老师的帮助、指点下能够创造出很好的作品。这在去年东北鲁迅美术学院雕塑系师生，集体为北京农业展览馆创作的两座大圆雕“人民公社万岁”，受到了社会上一致的好评，就早已说明了这个问题，而在这次展出中也就再一次的得到证明。听说有些青年学生因此骄傲起来，这当然是错误的，我们必须加强对他们的教育。但是这种革命的作法，势必对全国许多青年美术学生发生好的影响和刺激作用。
    如果谈“新鲜感觉”，以上这些就是感觉的来源。
    从东北美展里也还看出一些存在的问题。尽管有许多作品是成功的，但也还有一些作品在反映生活上有自然主义的倾向；有的作品还停留在素材的阶段；艺术的表现技巧也还不能随心所欲去表达画家的创作意愿，某些作品显得艺术性差。各省的各种美术体裁，还有高低之分，版画在黑龙江就比较本省的其它画种突出些；辽宁省的国画、雕塑就引人注意些；吉林省的国画、油画也比本省的其它作品好一些。从三个省来比较，由于发展条件的不同，有的就高一些，有的就比较低一些。通过不断的展览，互相借鉴和观摩，就将使较低的迅速提高，后进的达到先进的水平。
    北京的美术家们为这个展览举行了一次座谈会，没有人讲那些抽象的捧场客气话，大家认为东北三省美展是成功的。北京的美术家和美术院校的学生们，都可以从这个展览会里学到东西，得到很多启发。
