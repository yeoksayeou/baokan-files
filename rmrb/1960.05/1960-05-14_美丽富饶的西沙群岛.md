    Beautiful and Rich Xisha Islands
    Zhang Mu
    In the vast sea of our motherland's South China Sea, there are many scattered islands. The Xisha Islands are some of these islands, like dozens of shining pearls, standing tall on the boundless sea.
    The Xisha Islands are composed of fifteen large and small islands and countless sandbars. The Xisha Islands are generally not too large and do not protrude high above the sea, averaging below ten meters in altitude. Most of the islands are oval, and a few are ring-shaped. The islands are surrounded by coral reef platforms, forming natural breakwaters. Whenever the tide rises, the sea rushes against the reefs, creating white waves more than ten feet high. From a distance, they look like a crown made of thousands of white magnolia flowers, making the Xisha Islands appear particularly majestic and magnificent. When the tide recedes, the sea becomes so calm, and beautiful coral rocks are half-exposed above the sea, hiding various beautiful small shells under the coral stones.
    Stepping onto Yongxing Island, the first thing you see is mountains of bird manure. This is processed by the workers on the island and piled up at the dock, ready to be shipped. If you walk into the forest, you feel like you are stepping on a soft carpet. That thick layer is all bird manure. Experts call this layer on the surface of the island the bird manure layer. Bird manure is not entirely bird droppings; it also contains some rotten plant stems, leaves, and other impurities. Bird manure mainly contains chemical components such as phosphorus, nitrogen, and potassium, which are among the best natural fertilizers for agriculture in our country. Nine of the Xisha Islands are rich in bird manure. The Yongxing Island, Shidao Island, and Dongdao Island, which have the largest reserves, are estimated to have more than 200,000 tons each.
    The people on the island say that when they first arrived on Yongxing Island, tropical birds were almost everywhere. Every evening, all kinds of birds perch on the sea buckthorn trees. Some birds are not afraid of people at all, and you can even catch them by hand. If it is windy or rainy, some birds fly into the houses and even rest on the owner's bedside. In recent years, due to the increasing number of residents on the island, most of the birds on Yongxing Island have flown to Dongdao Island. Now, Dongdao Island has the most birds, and some people call it the "Kingdom of Birds." In the blue sea and green islands, tens of thousands of birds fly, compete, and show off their beauty, which is another magnificent scene in Xisha. Among them, there is a kind of bird that gains without working. Relying on its size and eyesight, it specializes in plundering fish and shrimp that other seabirds have caught to feed their young. In the sky above Dongdao Island, you can often see fierce battles between the flock of birds and this bird. The people on the island call this bird "robber."
    Seabirds are good friends of fishermen. When fishermen fish at sea, seabirds often help them. Seabirds hover in groups over schools of fish, and fishing boats follow the flocks to catch the fish, often resulting in a good harvest. Therefore, fishermen call this bird "navigation bird."
    The Xisha Islands are one of the best fishing grounds in our country with the richest reserves of fish. Every year, hundreds of fishing boats from Guangdong Province go there to fish. It is rich in grouper, sardines, mackerel, redfish, cuttlefish, sharks, mackerel, Spanish mackerel, etc. Each fish generally weighs more than ten pounds, and the larger ones weigh hundreds or even thousands of pounds. The peak fishing season here is from March to July. Last year, under the inspiration of the Great Leap Forward in the country, the fishermen of Xisha added six kinds of fishing operations. It is said that the most promising is large-scale seine fishing. The highest record for one net was 120 dan, and generally it is 10 to 20 dan.
    The Xisha Islands also produce a large number of seahorses. Fishermen say that every year after May and June, you can see groups of seahorses playing in the sea. Seahorse fat can be extracted into oil, which is one of the important lubricating oils for precision instruments and is very valuable.
    The sea turtles of Xisha are also very famous. There are three kinds of turtles in Xisha: sea turtles, hawksbill turtles, and loggerhead turtles, each with different characteristics. Sea turtles are about one meter long and weigh between 100 and 250 kilograms. Loggerhead turtles, commonly known as big-headed turtles, are similar in shape to sea turtles, but have particularly large heads. Hawksbill turtles have horny plates in an imbricated pattern, with five vertebral plates and four pairs of costal plates, hence the name "thirteen scales." The body shape is generally smaller than sea turtles and loggerhead turtles.
    Every part of the sea turtle is valuable. The meat is edible, tastes very delicious, and has high nutritional value, and can be made into canned turtle meat. The fat can be extracted into oil, which is a raw material for light industry. The upper shell can be used as fertilizer, and the bottom shell is a valuable raw material for traditional Chinese medicine. Although hawksbill turtles cannot be eaten, their shells are raw materials for valuable ornaments.
    Sea turtles are clumsy and easy to catch. Every night, the turtles enter the reef platform with the tide and climb onto the beach to lay their eggs. Fishermen patrol the beach at night and, upon discovering a turtle climbing onto the beach, immediately cut off its retreat and forcefully turn the turtle over, so that its feet are facing the sky, and it cannot escape. Fishermen call this "turtle patrolling." Sometimes, they can catch five or six, or even a dozen turtles in one night.
    The Xisha Islands are rich in sea cucumbers. Flower sea cucumbers, square sea cucumbers, red melon sea cucumbers, and black dog sea cucumbers have the highest yield, in addition to black teat sea cucumbers, white teat sea cucumbers, and white melon sea cucumbers. The tentacles of the flower sea cucumber are shaped like plum blossoms and are more than a foot long.
    Sea cucumber is a kind of seabed animal, which is accustomed to living in seaweed and rocky sandy soil. Large sea cucumbers are mostly in the deeper seabed outside the coral reef, and harvesting sea cucumbers must rely on diving operations. The harvesting season for various types of sea cucumbers is inconsistent. Large sea cucumbers are mostly harvested from May to October, and small sea cucumbers are generally harvested from November to April of the following year. Harvesting sea cucumbers is a very arduous task, especially harvesting large sea cucumbers, which requires diving into the deeper seabed. The value of sea cucumbers is higher for this reason. We visited the sea cucumber processing plant on the island, where sea cucumbers were piled up like mountains, and workers were turning them over to dry. The person in charge of this unit told us that Xisha can produce 400 to 500 tons of various types of sea cucumbers annually, and the output will increase greatly in the future by combining catching and breeding. In addition, the Xisha Islands are also rich in Gracilaria. As soon as you arrive on Yongxing Island, you can see the beach full of dried Gracilaria, which people also call kylin vegetables. This is a shallow water plant, which is very valuable and is an important raw material for light industry. It can be used to make bacterial culture media, agar, and bird's nest substitutes. At present, several units in Xisha are concentrating on producing Gracilaria to meet the large needs of the domestic market.
    No one who goes to Xisha does not like the various sea snails and shells. They are not only pleasing to the eye but also have economic value. The snail meat is edible and tastes very delicious. The shells can be used as industrial raw materials, and each dan is worth 50 to 60 yuan or even 100 yuan. As for the colorful small shells, they are even more pleasing. The large ones include the Tang Kou shell, the Sheng snail, the spider snail, and the bamboo shoot snail. The small ones include the tiger spot baby, the Torre shell, and the even smaller ones include the eyeball shell, the petal shell, and the cowrie shell. They are not only unique in shape and diverse in variety, but also bright in color and dazzling, which cannot be replicated by humans. Because they are pleasing, they were used as currency in ancient China. Therefore, the character "贝" (bèi, shell) was created by simulating the shape of a shell.
    The Xisha Islands are full of treasures. Every island and every sea area contains extremely rich resources. There is no doubt that they will play an increasingly important role in our country's socialist construction.

    美丽富饶的西沙群岛
    张牧
    在我们祖国南海的广阔海面上，散布着许多小岛，西沙群岛就是其中的一部分岛屿，它像几十颗灿烂的明珠，屹立在碧波万顷的海上。
    西沙群岛是由大小十五个岛屿和无数的沙洲组成的。西沙各岛一般不算太大，突出海面也不高，平均都在海拔十米以下。大多数岛呈椭圆形，也有少数呈环状。岛的周围还有珊瑚礁盘环绕，形成天然的防波堤。每当涨潮时，海潮冲击礁盘，掀起丈多高的白浪花，远远望去像是千万朵白玉兰花做的花冠，使西沙的姿态格外雄伟、壮丽；而当退潮时，海面又显得那样平静，一颗颗俊丽的珊瑚石花半露于海面，在珊瑚石下隐藏着各种各样美丽的小贝壳。
    踏上永兴岛，第一眼就看到堆积如山的鸟肥。这是岛上工人已经加工后堆放在码头上待运的。如果走进森林，你就像踏在软绵绵的地毯上，那厚厚的一层全部是鸟肥。专家们把岛屿表面的这一层称做鸟粪层。所谓鸟肥不完全是鸟粪，它还掺有一些腐烂植物的茎叶等其它杂质。鸟肥主要含有磷、氮、钾等化学成分，是我国农业上最好的天然肥料之一。西沙有九个岛盛产鸟肥，储藏量最多的永兴岛、石岛和东岛，估计各约有二十余万吨。
    岛上的人说：初登永兴岛时，几乎遍岛都是热带鸟。每到傍晚，海桐树上歇满了各种鸟，有些鸟一点也不怕人，甚至用手也能捉到，如果遇到刮风下雨，有些鸟就飞进房子里，甚至歇在主人的床头。这几年由于岛上居民增多，永兴岛上的鸟已大部飞到东岛了。现在东岛的鸟是最多的，有人把它叫作“鸟之国”。在碧海绿岛上空，万鸟飞翔，争鸣斗艳，是西沙又一壮丽美景。其中有一种鸟，它不劳而获，依仗它的身躯和眼力，专门掠夺其它海鸟衔回哺喂幼鸟的鱼虾。在东岛上空就可时常看到群鸟和这种鸟激烈的争夺战，岛上的人把这种鸟称为“强盗”。
    海鸟是渔民的好朋友。渔民在海上打鱼，海鸟常常给他们帮忙：海鸟成群地盘旋在鱼群上空，渔船跟着鸟群追捕鱼群，常常获得丰收。因此，渔民把这种鸟叫作“导航鸟”。
    西沙群岛是我国鱼产蕴藏量最丰富的优良渔场之一。我国广东省渔民每年有好几百条船到这里打鱼。这里盛产有石斑鱼、沙丁鱼、马鲛鱼、红鱼、墨鱼、鲨鱼、鲭鱼、鰆鱼等，每条鱼一般都有十来斤，大者数百斤以至几千斤。这里捕鱼旺季为3月至7月。去年西沙渔民在全国大跃进的鼓舞之下，增加了六种捕鱼作业，据说前途最大的是大型围网，一网的最高纪录曾达到一百二十担，一般情况下也有一、二十担。
    西沙还盛产大量的海马。渔民说每年5、6月以后，海面上就可以看到成群的海马在戏水。海马脂肪可熬油，是精密仪器重要的滑润油料之一，价值极贵。
    西沙的大海龟也很出名。西沙的龟有三种：海龟、玳瑁、?龟，特征各异。海龟体长一公尺左右，体重在一百至二百五十市斤；?龟俗称大头?，体形略与海龟相仿，但头特大；玳瑁角质板呈复瓦状，上面有椎板五块、肋板四对，故又有“十三鳞”之称。体形一般比海龟、?龟小。
    海龟全身无一废物。肉可食，味很鲜美，营养价值很高，可制龟肉罐头；脂肪可熬油，是轻工业原料；上壳可作肥料，底甲是中药贵重原料。玳瑁虽不能吃，但甲壳是名贵装饰品的原料。
    海龟体笨，容易捕捉。每到天黑，龟乘潮水进入礁盘，爬上沙滩产卵。渔民在夜里沿着沙滩巡逻，发现龟爬上沙滩，立即截断退路，用力将龟体翻过来，使其四脚朝天，它怎么也逃不脱了。渔民管这叫“巡龟”。有时一夜能捉五、六只，甚至十几只。
    西沙群岛盛产海参。梅花参、方参、赤瓜参、黑狗参产量最多，此外还有黑乳参、白乳参、白瓜参等。梅花参触头形状像梅花，有一尺多长。
    参是一种海底动物，习惯栖息在海藻和岩礁沙土中。大型参多在珊瑚礁外缘较深的海底，采参必须依靠潜水作业。各类参的采捞季节不一致，大型参多在五至十月，小型参一般在十一月至第二年四月。采参是相当艰苦的劳动，尤其是采大型参，必须潜入较深的海底作业，参的价值较高就是这个道理。我们参观了岛上的海参加工场，那里海参堆积如山，工人正在翻晒。这个单位的负责人告诉我，西沙可年产各类参四、五百吨，将来捕、养并举，产量还会大增。此外，西沙还盛产石花菜。一登永兴岛，就可以看到沙滩上晒满了石花菜，人们又叫它麒麟菜。这是一种浅水植物，价值很高，是轻工业重要原料之一。利用它可做细菌培养剂，可制洋粉，也可做燕窝代用品。目前西沙几个单位正集中力量生产石花菜，以满足国内市场的大量需要。
    到西沙的人没有一个不喜欢那各种各样的海螺、贝壳，它不仅耐人欣赏，而且具有经济价值。螺肉可食，味极鲜美；壳可做工业原料，每担价值五、六十元以至百元不等。至于那五光十色的小贝壳更是逗人喜爱，大的如唐寇贝、笙螺、蜘蛛螺、笋螺，小的如虎斑宝贝、榧螺，更小的如眼球贝，花瓣贝、货贝等，不仅形状奇特，种类繁多，而且颜色鲜艳、光泽夺目，绝非人工所能复制。由于它逗人喜爱，我国古代就曾把它当做流通的货币。因此“贝”字就是模拟贝的形状创制的。
    西沙群岛，遍地是宝。每一个岛屿，每一块海区都蕴藏着极其丰富的资源。毫无疑问，它在我国社会主义建设事业中将会发挥越来越重要的作用。
