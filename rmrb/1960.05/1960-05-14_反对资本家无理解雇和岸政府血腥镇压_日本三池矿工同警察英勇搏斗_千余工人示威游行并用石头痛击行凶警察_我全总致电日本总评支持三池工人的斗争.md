Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 13th: Japanese Miike coal miners yesterday held another demonstration to oppose the capitalists' plan to dismiss 1,200 workers. The Kishi Nobusuke government dispatched armed police to suppress them, injuring more than sixty workers. The Miike coal miners bravely resisted the police's bloody suppression.

The struggle took place yesterday afternoon, when more than a thousand workers from the largest coal mine of the Mitsui zaibatsu company held a demonstration against the dismissal plan. The Kishi Nobusuke government's police blocked the workers' demonstration and beat the demonstrating workers with clubs. A fierce conflict broke out between the two sides. Angry workers used stones to attack the murderous police. The scale of the struggle grew, and thousands of workers ran to support their comrades, and the number of police also increased to more than four thousand.

Socialist Party Diet members Noriharu Yoshida and Noboru Agune, who went to stop the police's violence, were also injured by the police. The police also arrested a worker.

To protest against the police's brutality, the Miike coal miners held a two-hour sit-in protest at the scene of the conflict, which did not disperse until the arrested worker was released.

The Miike Coal Mine Union, the Japan Coal Mine Workers' Union, and the Japan General Council of Trade Unions Lawyers' Group issued statements last night condemning the bloody suppression by the Kishi Nobusuke government, and pointed out that this was a planned provocation by the police.

The Socialist Party's Miike Struggle Committee also issued a statement strongly condemning the police's suppression of workers and the injury of Socialist Party Diet members. The statement stated that the Socialist Party will thoroughly investigate the police's responsibility for this bloodshed.

The Miike coal miners' struggle against the capitalists' mass dismissals has persisted for more than eight months. During this period, the capitalists have hired thugs and police to suppress the striking workers many times, injuring more than two hundred workers and arresting thirty-four people. They also created puppet trade unions in an attempt to split the union organization. However, the workers are united and determined to fight. The workers and their wives and children have held many strikes and protest rallies. Their struggle has received the support of the entire Japanese working class and the broad masses of the people.

Our newspaper reports: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions sent a telegram to the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan on May 13 to support the heroic struggle of the Japanese Miike coal miners.

The telegram stated: We are shocked to learn that the Kishi Nobusuke government has once again mobilized a large number of police to suppress the Miike coal miners. The Chinese workers feel the greatest indignation and express serious protest. This fascist atrocity by the Kishi Nobusuke government is aimed at cracking down on the unprecedented 16th unified action, attempting to forcibly pass the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty in the Diet.

The Chinese people firmly support your just struggle and firmly believe that the Kishi Nobusuke government's bloody suppression will only arouse stronger resistance from the Japanese people, and the reactionary monopoly group's conspiracy will ultimately be defeated.

    我全总致电日本总评支持三池工人的斗争
    新华社13日讯　东京消息：日本三池煤矿工人昨天再次举行示威游行，反对资本家解雇一千二百名工人的计划。岸信介政府出动武装警察进行镇压，打伤了六十多名工人。三池煤矿工人对警察的血腥镇压，进行了英勇的抵抗。
    斗争发生在昨天下午，当时这个三井财阀公司中的最大煤矿的一千多名工人举行了反对解雇计划的示威游行，岸信介政府的警察阻挠工人的游行，并且用木棍殴打示威的工人。双方发生激烈的冲突。愤怒的工人用石头痛击行凶的警察。斗争规模越来越大，数千名工人跑来支援他们的战友，警察也增加到四千多人。
    前往制止警察暴行的社会党国会议员吉田法晴和阿具根登也被警察打伤。警察并且逮捕了一名工人。
    三池煤矿工人为了抗议警察的暴行，在发生冲突的地点举行了两小时的静坐抗议，一直到被逮捕的工人得到释放以后才解散。
    三池煤矿工会、日本煤矿工会和日本工会总评议会辩护律师团昨天晚上分别发表声明，谴责岸信介政府的血腥镇压，并指出这是警察有计划的挑衅。
    社会党三池斗争委员会也发表声明，强烈谴责警察镇压工人和打伤社会党国会议员。声明表示，社会党将就这个流血事件彻底追究警察的责任。
    三池煤矿工人反对资本家大批解雇的斗争已经坚持了八个多月。在这期间，资本家曾经雇用暴徒和警察对罢工工人多次进行镇压，打伤了二百多名工人，逮捕了三十四人。它们还制造御用工会，企图分裂工会组织。但是工人们团结一致，坚决斗争。工人和他们的妻子儿女们举行了许多次的罢工和抗议大会。他们的斗争受到了日本全体工人阶级和广大阶层人民的支持。
    本报讯　中华全国总工会5月13日致电日本工会总评议会，支持日本三池煤矿工人的英勇斗争。
    电文说：惊闻岸信介政府再一次动员大批警察镇压三池煤矿工人，中国工人感到最大的愤慨，并表示严重抗议。岸信介政府这种法西斯暴行，是为了打击规模空前的第十六次统一行动，企图在国会强行通过日美军事同盟条约。
    中国人民坚决支持你们的正义斗争，坚信岸信介政府血腥镇压只会激起日本人民更强烈的反抗，反动垄断集团的阴谋最后必将遭致失败。
