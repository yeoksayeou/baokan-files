Comrades:
　　The Japanese reactionaries, colluding with U.S. imperialism, have formed a military alliance, seriously threatening peace in Asia and the world. The Japanese people have risen up to oppose this aggressive conspiracy, with millions signing petitions and millions marching, launching more than a dozen large-scale struggles against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. We, the 2.8 million farmers in the Beijing suburbs, firmly support the just struggle of the Japanese people to smash the war conspiracy of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries.
　　The Chinese people know the true face of Japanese imperialism very well. Twenty-three years ago, right here in our commune – Lugouqiao – Japanese imperialism launched its war of aggression against China. For eight years, the Chinese people suffered terribly. Building blockhouses, seizing young men as forced labor, killing, arson, committing all kinds of evil, worse than beasts. Mentioning these things, it is like drinking cold water in winter, each drop chilling the heart. Now, the wolf-hearted and dog-lunged U.S. imperialism and its Japanese running dogs, colluding together, still want to continue bullying the Japanese people, bullying the Chinese people, bullying the Asian people. We know that as long as the Japanese reactionaries exist, the Japanese people will suffer. As long as U.S. imperialism exists, the people of the world will not have a single day of peace. Without overthrowing the Japanese reactionaries, without overthrowing U.S. imperialism, the Japanese people cannot liberate themselves, and world peace is not guaranteed. As long as all the Japanese people unite and resolutely struggle, the reactionary government will surely collapse. U.S. imperialism will not live long either.
　　We, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, have already liberated ourselves and stood up. We must support the Japanese people to liberate themselves, support the Asian people to liberate themselves, support the African people to liberate themselves, support the Latin American people to liberate themselves, and support all the oppressed people in the world to liberate themselves. We have the strength to support them. We must support them to the end. Let the Chinese and Japanese people unite, let the people of the world unite, and overthrow U.S. imperialism!

    我们一定支持日本人民翻身
    芦沟桥人民公社副主任田岐的讲话同志们：
    日本反动派和美帝国主义勾结，结成军事同盟，严重地威胁了亚洲和世界和平。日本人民起来反对这种侵略阴谋，成千万人签名，成百万人游行，展开了十几次大规模的斗争，反对日美军事同盟条约。我们北京郊区二百八十万农民，坚决支持日本人民的正义斗争，粉碎日美反动派的战争阴谋。
    日本帝国主义的原形，中国人民知道得很清楚，二十三年前，就在我们公社——芦沟桥，日本帝国主义发动了侵略中国的战争。八年时间，把中国人民糟蹋得很苦，修炮楼、抓壮丁，杀人放火，无恶不作，野兽不如。提起这些事来，真是冬天喝凉水，滴滴在心。现在，狼心狗肺的美帝国主义，和它的日本走狗，勾结起来，还想继续欺负日本人民，欺负中国人民，欺负亚洲人民。我们知道，有日本反动派一天，日本人民就受罪一天，有美帝国主义存在一天，世界人民就没有一天安生日子。不打倒日本反动派，不打倒美帝国主义，日本人民就翻不了身，世界和平就没有保证。只要全体日本人民团结起来，坚决斗争，反动政府就一定垮台。美帝国主义也活不长了。
    我们中国人民，在党和毛主席领导下，已经翻了身，已经站起来了。我们一定要支持日本人民翻身，支持亚洲人民翻身，支持非洲人民翻身，支持拉丁美洲人民翻身，支持全世界被压迫的人民翻身。我们有力量支持他们。我们一定要支持到底。中日两国人民团结起来，全世界人民团结起来，打倒美帝国主义！
