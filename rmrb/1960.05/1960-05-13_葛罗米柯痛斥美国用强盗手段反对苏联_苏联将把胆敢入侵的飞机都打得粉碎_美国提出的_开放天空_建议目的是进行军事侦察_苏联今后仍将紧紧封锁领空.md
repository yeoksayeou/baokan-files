Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 11th. Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko, at a press conference held here on the 11th, condemned the provocative act of U.S. reconnaissance planes intruding into Soviet airspace. In his speech, he emphasized: "From now on, we will greet these uninvited guests as the Soviet people have always greeted invaders. Any aircraft that dares to violate our borders will be smashed to pieces."

Gromyko said: "Those who provide bases on their territory for aircraft invading our borders should know that if similar provocative actions occur again, the Soviet Union will have the capability to render these bases harmless."

Gromyko spoke at the press conference regarding the presentation of material evidence related to the U.S. aircraft that had invaded Soviet airspace and was shot down by Soviet missile forces.

He said that the material evidence of the U.S. aircraft on display convincingly demonstrates that the U.S. employed robber-like tactics against the Soviet Union. The factual material held by the Soviet government undoubtedly proves that the actions of the U.S. responsible authorities in dispatching aircraft to invade Soviet airspace were motivated by preparations for aggression and hostility towards the cause of peace. Gromyko pointed out that the organizers of this provocative action have been driven into a corner by irrefutable facts.

Gromyko severely condemned the lies and statements fabricated by the U.S. government to deny its crime of aggression. He pointed out that after the U.S. government's claim that the downed aircraft was merely a weather reconnaissance plane was declared bankrupt, and it was forced to admit that the aircraft was sent into Soviet territory on a military reconnaissance mission, U.S. Secretary of State Herter issued a statement saying that U.S. military aircraft intruded into Soviet airspace because the Soviet Union had not accepted the U.S. "Open Skies" proposal. Gromyko said that even the word "shameless" is too mild to describe this statement. He said that this behavior is the behavior of a robber on the international stage. The U.S. aircraft deliberately violated the inviolability of Soviet airspace, and this U.S. practice trampled on the United Nations Charter.

Gromyko sternly refuted U.S. Secretary of State Herter's claim that the provocative action of U.S. aircraft intruding into Soviet airspace would not be detrimental to the upcoming summit conference. Gromyko said that it is conceivable that U.S. national activists do not regard the task of the summit conference as resolving mature international issues, but as discussing which more sophisticated reconnaissance methods to use to invade each other, and which more effective methods to use to heat up the international situation.

In answering questions from reporters after his speech, Gromyko said that countries that provide their territory to the U.S. Air Force for aggressive activities should understand that they are accomplices in U.S. aggression.

He also said that the U.S. propaganda machine says that things would have been easier if the pilot had committed suicide or the plane had not been found. This is a complete imperialist morality, the morality of beasts.

Gromyko pointed out that the reason the U.S. is so interested in the "Open Skies" issue is because this proposal is in line with the military reconnaissance interests of U.S. imperialism. He emphasized that the Soviet sky is closed, and will continue to be tightly closed in the future.

Several hundred Soviet and foreign reporters attended today's press conference. After the meeting, the reporters viewed the wreckage and related objects of the downed U.S. military aircraft.

    葛罗米柯痛斥美国用强盗手段反对苏联
    苏联将把胆敢入侵的飞机都打得粉碎
    美国提出的“开放天空”建议目的是进行军事侦察　苏联今后仍将紧紧封锁领空
    新华社莫斯科11日电　苏联外交部长葛罗米柯11日在这里举行的记者招待会上，谴责美国侦察飞机侵入苏联领空的挑衅行为。他在讲话中强调说：“今后我们仍将像苏联人民一向对待侵略者那样，来迎接这些不速之客。胆敢侵犯我国国境的飞机都将被打得粉碎”。
    葛罗米柯说：“那些在自己的领土上为侵犯我国国境的飞机提供基地的人们应当知道，如果再度发生类似的挑衅行动，苏联将有能力使这些基地不再为害。”
    葛罗米柯在记者招待会上就展出被苏联火箭部队击落的侵犯苏联领空的美国飞机的有关物证发表了讲话。
    他说，展出的美国飞机的物证令人信服地表明，美国为了反对苏联，运用了强盗式的手段，苏联政府所掌握的事实材料确凿无疑地证明，美国负责当局派遣飞机侵入苏联领空的行动，是抱有准备侵略和敌视和平事业的目的的。葛罗米柯指出，这一挑衅行动的组织者已被不可争辩的事实逼得走投无路。
    葛罗米柯严厉谴责了美国政府为抵赖自己的侵略罪行而制造的谎言和声明。他指出，美国政府在制造了被击落的飞机只是一架气象侦察机的说法宣告破产、从而被迫承认这架飞机派到苏联境内是带有军事侦察任务之后，又发表了美国国务卿赫脱的声明，这个声明说什么似乎美国军用飞机侵犯苏联领空，是因为苏联没有接受美国提出的“开放天空”的建议。葛罗米柯说，甚至用“无耻”这个字眼来形容这篇声明，都嫌太温和了。他说，这种行为在国际舞台上是强盗的行为。美国飞机蓄意破坏了苏联领空的不可侵犯性，美国这种作法是践踏了联合国宪章。
    葛罗米柯严厉驳斥了美国国务卿赫脱所谓美国飞机侵犯苏联领空的挑衅行动不会有害于即将召开的最高级会议的说法。葛罗米柯说，可以想像，美国国家活动家没有把最高级会议的任务看成是解决业已成熟的国际问题，而是看成讨论用哪些更加完善的侦察方法去互相侵犯，讨论用哪些更加有效的方法，以便使国际局势白热化。
    葛罗米柯在讲话后回答记者们提出的问题时说，提供自己的领土给美国空军进行侵略活动的国家应该懂得，它们是美国侵略活动的同谋者。
    他还说，美国宣传机器说什么如果飞行员自杀了或是飞机没有被寻获，事情就好办了。这是一种十足的帝国主义道德，野兽的道德。
    葛罗米柯指出，美国所以对“开放天空”问题这样感兴趣，是因为这一建议符合美帝国主义的军事侦察利益。他强调说，苏联的天空是封锁的、而且今后还要紧紧地封锁。
    参加今天记者招待会的有苏联和外国记者数百人。会后记者们观看了被击落的美国军用飞机的残骸和有关物件。
