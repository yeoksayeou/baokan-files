    Flaming Mountains
    Shí Gōng
    The "Flaming Mountains" in *Journey to the West* are known to everyone in our country, young and old. But everyone also knows that what's written in *Journey to the West* is just mythology. Does the Earth really have a true Flaming Mountain?
    Passengers on airplanes traveling from Lanzhou to Urumqi can indeed see a scene of flames rising into the air. But upon closer inspection, it turns out to be a mountain range made of red rocks, which looks like flames under the sunlight. Even though there is no fire here, it is still called the Flaming Mountains, and many people believe that the "Flaming Mountains" in *Journey to the West* are an exaggerated description based on it. This is because it is located on the northern edge of the Turpan Basin, possibly on the road taken by Tang Sanzang to obtain the scriptures.
    Interestingly, this place is not only hot now, but it was also very hot in ancient times when those rocks were formed, and the red color of the rocks is the evidence. Usually, under hot conditions, the iron in the sediment is easily oxidized, forming red rust, so the stones made of them also appear red.
    But no matter how hot it is, there has never been a fire, so this is not a real Flaming Mountain.
    Those volcanoes on Earth that are still erupting should be called true Flaming Mountains, right? When a volcano erupts, the sky is filled with fire, thick smoke rises, and red-hot lava flows on the ground, with temperatures often reaching over a thousand degrees. Around the volcano, there are often many piles of fine volcanic ash that resemble incense ash. But strictly speaking, volcanoes cannot be considered true Flaming Mountains. Because volcanic eruptions are not the result of combustion. The heat needed for volcanic activity comes from the interior of the Earth. This heat may be mainly emitted by radioactive elements in the Earth, not produced by combustion.
    Is there no real Flaming Mountain on Earth then? Yes, there is. In Datong, Shanxi, there is Seven Peaks Mountain, which used to emit smoke for a long time. That was caused by underground coal seams burning. Xinjiang also has this kind of Flaming Mountain. A traveler once described it this way: "In the vast darkness of night, the Flaming Mountain reveals its truly magnificent face. Tongues of fire flicker and move on the slopes of the mountains, high and low, near and far, like the lights lit in thousands of households."
    The appearance of this kind of real Flaming Mountain is not welcome, because many valuable resources are burned away in vain. This is mostly caused by the exploitative class’s indiscriminate mining and lack of attention to mine maintenance in the past. After liberation, we spent a lot of effort to extinguish them. For example, the Datong Coal Mine in Huainan extinguished thirty-one underground fires, rescuing one million tons of recoverable coal.
    But if the burning of coal seams underground can be controlled by us, bad things can be turned into good things. For example, the coal gas produced by incomplete combustion is a very good fuel and chemical raw material. If we make the coal burn properly underground to produce coal gas, and then use pipes to draw the coal gas for utilization, we can greatly save coal mining labor. According to Soviet experience, labor productivity can be increased four times compared to underground mining. Many coal mining equipment and transportation tools can also be saved, the cost is greatly reduced, and it is very convenient and clean to use.
    About seventy-two years ago, the great scientist Mendeleev first proposed the idea of underground coal gasification. More than twenty years ago, his idea became a reality in the Soviet Union. Our country has also begun experiments, and in the near future, it will be controlled underground to become an underground Flaming Mountain. In our hands, the Flaming Mountain will also bow its head to serve mankind.

    火焰山

    西游记里的“火焰山”在我国是老幼皆知的，但是大家也知道西游记里写的不过是些神话，究竟地球上有没有真正的火焰山呢？
    搭乘飞机的旅客在从兰州到乌鲁木齐的途中，确实可以望见火焰腾空而起的景色。但定睛一瞧，原来是红色岩石构成的山岭，在阳光照射下看起来好像火焰一般。尽管这里没有火，现在还是被人叫做火焰山，而且许多人相信西游记上的“火焰山”就是根据它来夸张描写的。因为它位于吐鲁番盆地的北缘，可能正在唐僧取经的路上。
    说来也有趣，这里不仅现在很热，在古代当那些石头形成的时候也曾经很炎热，石头的红色就是证据。通常在炎热的条件下，泥沙中的铁质容易氧化，形成红色的铁锈，因而由它们造成的石头也呈现红色。
    但是不管怎样热，毕竟从来没有火，这不是真正的火焰山。
    地球上那些还正在喷发的火山，应该称得起是真正的火焰山了吧？在火山喷发的时候，火光漫天，浓烟升起，地上流着赤热的熔岩，温度常达一千多度，在火山的四周还常常堆积着许多香灰一样细的火山灰。但是严格地说来，火山还是不能算真正的火焰山。因为火山喷发并不是燃烧的结果。火山活动所需要的热是从地球内部得到的，这些热可能主要为地球中的放射性元素发出的，不是燃烧所产生。
    难道地球上就没有真正的火焰山了么？有的，山西大同有座七峰山从前就曾长期冒出烟，那是地下的煤层在燃烧。新疆也有这种火焰山，一位旅行者曾经这样描绘它：“火焰山在茫茫的黑夜里，显露出它真正奇丽的面容，火舌在高高低低远远近近的山坡上闪烁在动，像千百户人家燃起的灯火。”
    这种真正的火焰山的出现是不值得欢迎的，因为许多宝贵的资源白白地被烧掉了，这大多是从前由于剥削阶级滥行开采和不注意矿山的维护造成的。解放后我们曾花了很大力量去扑灭它，如淮南大通煤矿就曾扑灭三十一处地下火，抢救了一百万吨可以开采的煤炭。
    但是煤层在地下的燃烧如果能为我们控制，坏事便能变成了好事。例如燃烧不完全所产生的煤气就是很好的燃料和化工原料。如果我们使煤在地下适当燃烧产生煤气，再将煤气用管子引来利用，就可以大大节省采煤的劳动力。据苏联的经验，劳动生产率能比矿井采煤时提高四倍。许多采煤设备和运输工具也可以省掉了，成本大大降低，使用起来还非常方便清洁。
    约在七十二年前，伟大的科学家门德列也夫第一次提出了使煤在地下气化的想法，二十多年前他的想法在苏联变成了现实。我国也已开始试验，不久的将来它将被控制在地下成为地下的火焰山。在我们的手里，火焰山也得低头为人类服务了。
