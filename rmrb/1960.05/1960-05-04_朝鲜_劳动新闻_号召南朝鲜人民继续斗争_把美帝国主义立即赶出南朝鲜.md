Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 3rd. The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published a commentary today, calling on the people of South Korea to continue their struggle and immediately disband the South Korean police who suppress and massacre the people.

The commentary said that on May 2nd, the people of Busan and Daegu launched new large-scale demonstrations and struggles. This directly answered the conspiracy of American imperialism to maintain its colonial rule by attempting to direct its second puppet, Heo Jeong, to maintain the Syngman Rhee fascist regime.

The commentary said that the running dogs of American imperialism are now clamoring for the "neutralization" of the police, which is nothing more than putting a sheep's skin on a wolf. The people of South Korea clearly know that the Syngman Rhee police are the direct organs for implementing the colonial policies of American imperialism and all the fascist decrees of the Syngman Rhee clique, and are bloody tools for suppressing and massacring the people.

The commentary said that the Syngman Rhee police are the most barbaric repressive tool in the world, created by adding American-style barbarism to the vicious Japanese police organization. It rides roughshod over the people of South Korea and does all kinds of evil. In 1959 alone, more than 247,000 patriots, democrats, and innocent people were arrested, imprisoned, and massacred by the Syngman Rhee police. The commentary said that it is no accident that the people of South Korea, when their anger erupted, first attacked, destroyed, and burned down police stations and substations.

The commentary pointed out that the conspiracy of the Heo Jeong faction to clamor for "police neutralization" is to reorganize the police organization, which has been impacted by the people's resistance struggle, as soon as possible, in order to maintain the colonial rule of American imperialism and retaliate and re-attack the people.

The commentary said that the issue of disbanding the South Korean police and organizing a people's police to maintain public order is a matter of urgency. American imperialism, the organizer of all evils, must be driven out of South Korea immediately. The people of South Korea must continue to ignite the flames of resistance struggle even higher for this purpose.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 2nd. The Soviet "Pravda" published an article today on the situation in South Korea, pointing out that the South Korean ruler Syngman Rhee, whose hands are stained with blood, has stepped down, but the struggle of the South Korean people is far from over.

The article said that news from Seoul shows that the reactionary forces there and their foreign patrons are attempting to continue to maintain a puppet regime that brings poverty and disaster to the people under the false banner of "anti-communism." Some Syngman Rhee elements who are particularly hated by the people have stepped down, but they are replaced by other reactionary elements who are equally loyal to the United States.

The article continued that some groups in the United States are well aware of the current South Korean acting "President" Heo Jeong. Reactionary newspapers across the ocean are touting him, and American Senator Keating has been clamoring in recent days to send additional troops to South Korea to "help consolidate the 'interim government'." The article emphasized that the people of South Korea will never allow themselves to be deceived by the trick of "changing rulers."

The article said that all patriots who sympathize with South Korea cannot take a laissez-faire attitude towards the position taken by some American figures. Some of these figures are even pretending to be "friends" of the South Korean people. However, under the guise of "friends," they are trying every means to make the residents of South Korea submit to their will.

The article said, who can believe the "friendship" of those who have cultivated and supported the bloody dictator regime?

The article emphasized that the masses of the people have united and fearlessly face the rulers' bayonets and automatic guns. They want to free South Korea from the "democracy" imported from the United States. This is an indisputable fact. But American commentator Lippmann insisted: "South Korea is completely incapable of maintaining its own independence and freedom, and it should continue to be our protector and supervisor in the future." But the patriots of South Korea have a different view on this. They understand that only when there are no more foreign occupiers in South Korea can a bright future be opened up in South Korea and true freedom and democracy be established. The article said that the Korean people should decide their own destiny, and this is their legitimate right.

Xinhua News Agency, May 2nd. New York News: The New York "Worker's Weekly" published an editorial on May 1st saying that the democratic interests of the Korean people, the national interests of the United States, and the cause of world peace now require the revocation of American military bases in South Korea and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from South Korea.

The editorial said that the struggle of the South Korean people against the dictatorial rule of the American puppet Syngman Rhee is conducive to the cause of world peace and freedom.

The editorial pointed out that due to the pursuit of the "brink of war" and "position of strength" strategies, the United States wants to ensure air bases and missile launch sites near China and the Soviet Union, and maintain the Syngman Rhee puppet regime. This policy once led to the war of aggression against Korea, which caused the deaths of millions of Koreans and many Americans.

### 朝鲜“劳动新闻”号召南朝鲜人民继续斗争  把美帝国主义立即赶出南朝鲜

    朝鲜“劳动新闻”号召南朝鲜人民继续斗争
    把美帝国主义立即赶出南朝鲜
    苏联“真理报”指出南朝鲜人民坚决要摆脱美国进口的“民主”
    美国“工人周报”说南朝鲜人民反对美李集团的斗争有利于世界和平
    新华社平壤3日电　朝鲜“劳动新闻”今天发表评论，号召南朝鲜人民继续展开斗争，立即解散镇压和屠杀人民的南朝鲜警察。
    评论说，5月2日釜山和大丘人民又开始了新的大示威斗争。这就直接回答了美帝国主义为了维持殖民统治，企图指使第二个傀儡许政代替李承晚来维持李承晚法西斯统治机构的阴谋。
    评论说，美帝国主义的走狗现在叫嚷什么警察的“中立化”，这只不过是要在狼身上披羊皮。南朝鲜人民清楚地知道，李承晚警察就是直接执行美帝国主义殖民政策和李承晚集团的一切法西斯法令的机关，是镇压和屠杀人民的血腥工具。
    评论说，李承晚警察是恶毒的日本警察机构加上美国式的野蛮而制造出来的世界上最野蛮的镇压工具。它骑在南朝鲜人民的头上为所欲为无恶不作，仅在1959年一年内被李承晚警察逮捕、囚禁和屠杀的爱国者、民主人士和无辜人民就有二十四万七千多人。评论说，因此，南朝鲜人民的愤怒一爆发就首先袭击、破坏和烧掉了警察署、派出所，这不是偶然的。
    评论指出，许政一派叫嚷什么“警察中立化”的阴谋就是为了早日整顿受到人民反抗斗争冲击的警察机构，以维持美帝国主义的殖民统治机构来报复和重新进攻人民。
    评论说，解散南朝鲜警察、组织人民警察维持治安的问题，是刻不容缓的问题。必须立即从南朝鲜赶走一切罪恶的组织者美帝国主义。南朝鲜人民必须为此继续更高地燃起反抗斗争的火焰。
    新华社莫斯科2日电　苏联“真理报”今天就南朝鲜局势发表的文章指出，双手沾满鲜血的南朝鲜统治者李承晚下台了，但是南朝鲜人民的斗争还远远没有结束。
    文章说，从汉城传来的消息表明，那里的反动势力和它们的外国庇护者企图在“反共”的虚假幌子下，继续保持给人民带来贫穷和灾难的傀儡政权。受到人民特别仇恨的一些李承晚分子下了台，但代替他们的是同样忠实于美国的另一些反动分子。
    文章接着说，美国的某些集团是很了解目前南朝鲜代理“总统”许政的。大洋彼岸的反动报纸正在为他大吹大擂，而美国议员基廷这几天曾叫嚷要往南朝鲜派遣补充兵力，以便“帮助巩固‘临时政府’”。文章强调指出，南朝鲜人民绝不允许用“更换执政者”的把戏来欺骗他们。
    文章说，所有同情南朝鲜的爱国者的人，不能对美国某些人物所采取的立场等闲视之。这些人物当中有些人竟装出一副南朝鲜人民的“朋友”的样子。但是，在“朋友”的幌子下，他们正在千方百计地使南朝鲜的居民服从于他们的意志。
    文章说，谁能相信那些曾经培植和支持血腥独裁者政权的人的“友谊”呢。
    文章强调说，人民群众已一致起来毫无畏惧地面对统治者的刺刀和自动枪，他们要使南朝鲜摆脱美国进口的“民主”，这已是不容争辩的事实了。而美国的评论员李普曼硬说：“南朝鲜完全没有能力保持自己的独立和自由，它今后仍然应该成为我们的被保护者和被监督者”。但南朝鲜的爱国者对这却有不同的看法，他们懂得，只有当南朝鲜不再有外国占领者的时候，在南朝鲜面前才能打开光明的局面，并确立真正的自由和民主。文章说，朝鲜人民要自己决定自己的命运，这是他们的合法权利。
    新华社2日讯　纽约消息：纽约“工人周报”5月1日发表社论说，朝鲜人民的民主利益，美国的民族利益以及世界和平的事业现在都要求撤销美国在南朝鲜的军事基地和把所有外国军队撤出南朝鲜。
    社论说，南朝鲜人民反对美国傀儡李承晚的独裁统治的斗争有利于世界和平和自由的事业。
    社论指出，由于奉行“战争边缘”和“实力地位”的战略，美国想确保邻近中国和苏联的空军基地和导弹发射场，并且维持李承晚傀儡政权。这个政策曾经导致上百万朝鲜人和许多美国人死亡的侵略朝鲜的战争。
