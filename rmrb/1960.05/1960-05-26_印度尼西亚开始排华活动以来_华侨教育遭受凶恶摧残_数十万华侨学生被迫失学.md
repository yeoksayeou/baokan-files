Xinhua News Agency, May 25th, Jakarta Dispatch: Since powerful groups in Indonesia have launched anti-China and anti-Chinese activities, overseas Chinese education has also been suffering fierce destruction step by step, and is currently facing the threat of gradual elimination. Up to now, hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese students have suffered the pain of being out of school.

　　Ban on Overseas Chinese Primary and Junior High Schools from Enrolling First-Grade Freshmen

　　The wartime authorities in Bogor and Tasikmalaya areas of West Java, where anti-China and anti-Chinese activities are the most rampant, recently ordered overseas Chinese primary and junior high schools not to enroll first-grade freshmen anymore. If this decree continues to be implemented, all overseas Chinese schools will be completely eliminated in six years. At the same time, according to newspaper reports, overseas Chinese schools may be completely eliminated even before six years. There are reports that the Indonesian authorities are preparing to ban overseas Chinese from running senior high schools, and then ban junior high schools. Other reports say that the Indonesian authorities plan to ban all foreign schools in the country in 1962.

　　In recent years, powerful groups in Indonesia have taken a series of measures to restrict and persecute overseas Chinese cultural and educational undertakings. The number of schools run by overseas Chinese through long-term hard work has been forced to reduce by about 72%, causing hundreds of thousands of students to be displaced and out of school.

　　Often Forcibly Requisitioning Overseas Chinese School Buildings, Forcing Suspension of Classes

　　In the large-scale anti-China and anti-Chinese activities, as part of the unreasonable destruction of overseas Chinese educational activities, the military authorities in many places often forcibly requisition overseas Chinese school buildings and force the suspension of classes, causing many overseas Chinese students to be out of school. Since the end of last year, such incidents have repeatedly occurred in West Java, Riau Province, North and Central Sulawesi, and other places. Since the implementation of large-scale forced relocation of overseas Chinese, the West Java authorities have forcibly requisitioned the school buildings of overseas Chinese schools in Karawang, Subang, Ciamis and other places to accommodate the forcibly relocated overseas Chinese, which has caused many overseas Chinese students to be out of school again.

　　In the name of "strengthening supervision" of overseas Chinese schools, the authorities in many regions of Indonesia are nitpicking and deliberately making things difficult for overseas Chinese schools in various ways.

　　Ban on Overseas Chinese Schools from Hanging the National Flag of the Motherland and Chairman Mao's Portrait

　　What aroused the infinite indignation of overseas Chinese even more was the prohibition of overseas Chinese schools from hanging the Chinese national flag and the portrait of Chairman Mao, the beloved leader of the Chinese people.

　　There are also many restrictions on teachers in overseas Chinese schools. The Indonesian Ministry of Culture and Education decided in July last year that from August 1961, only foreign teachers with Indonesian language examination diplomas would be allowed to teach in foreign schools.

　　Overseas Chinese education is built by the vast number of overseas Chinese relying on their own strength and long-term hard work. Since the establishment of overseas Chinese schools, they have trained a lot of talents, most of whom not only serve the overseas Chinese community, but also make certain contributions to the local social economy and cultural life from various positions. Overseas Chinese education, like the education of the Indonesian people, has developed in the constant struggle against the colonial authorities under the oppression and destruction of the imperialists. Overseas Chinese, like the Indonesian people, deeply understand the pain of having their national cultural traditions destroyed and persecuted in the long-term anti-Dutch colonial persecution and destruction of their cultural traditions, and deeply feel the preciousness of mutual respect for national cultures and the promotion of cultural exchange and development among all ethnic groups. It is precisely because of this that the vast number of overseas Chinese are extremely dissatisfied with the practice of destroying overseas Chinese education orchestrated by powerful groups in Indonesia, and they demand that the Indonesian authorities stop this persecution.

### 印度尼西亚开始排华活动以来  华侨教育遭受凶恶摧残  数十万华侨学生被迫失学

    印度尼西亚开始排华活动以来
    华侨教育遭受凶恶摧残
    数十万华侨学生被迫失学
    新华社25日讯　雅加达消息：自从印度尼西亚有势力集团掀起反华排华活动以来，华侨教育也在步步遭受凶恶的摧残，目前也面临着逐步被消灭的威胁，到现在已经有数十万华侨学生遭受失学痛苦。
    禁止华侨小学和初中招收一年级新生
    反华排华活动最猖狂的西爪哇的茂物、打横地区的战时掌权当局前不久已下令华侨小学和初中不得再招收一年级新生。如果继续实行这一法令，六年之后所有华侨学校即将全部消灭。同时据报纸消息透露，华侨学校甚至等不到六年就可能被全部消灭。有消息说，印度尼西亚当局准备禁止华侨办高中，然后禁办初中，另有消息说，印度尼西亚当局计划在1962年取缔全国外侨学校。
    印度尼西亚有势力集团近年来已经采取一系列限制和迫害华侨文化教育事业的措施，华侨长期艰辛兴办的学校，被迫减少了约72％，造成数十万学生流离失学。
    常常强行征用华侨学校校舍，迫令停学
    在大规模的反华排华活动中，作为无理摧残华侨教育活动的一部分，许多地方的军事当局常常强行征用华侨学校校舍，迫令停学，使许多华侨学生失学。从去年底以来，在西爪哇、廖内省、北和中苏拉威西等地一再发生这种事件。自从实行大规模迫迁华侨以来，西爪哇当局又强行征用加拉横、南安由、尖美士等地华侨学校校舍，作为收容被迫迁华侨之用，又使许多华侨学生失学。
    印度尼西亚许多地区当局在“加强监督”华侨学校的名义下，对华侨学校吹毛求疵、故意多方刁难。
    禁止华侨学校悬挂祖国国旗和毛主席像
    更加激起华侨无限愤慨的是，竟然禁止华侨学校悬挂中国国旗和中国人民敬爱的领袖毛主席的肖像。
    对于华侨学校教师，也多方限制。印度尼西亚文化和教育部在去年7月决定，从1961年8月起只准有印度尼西亚文考试毕业证书的外侨教师在外侨学校执教。
    华侨教育事业是广大华侨依靠自身力量、长期艰辛兴办而成的。华侨学校成立以来，培养了不少人材，他们绝大部分不仅为华侨社会服务，也从各种不同的岗位上，对当地的社会经济和文化生活作出了一定的贡献。华侨教育同印度尼西亚人民的教育一样，是在帝国主义者的摧残压迫下，同殖民主义当局进行不断的斗争中发展起来的。华侨同印度尼西亚人民一样，在长期反荷兰殖民迫害与摧残他们的文化传统的斗争中深知自己民族的文化传统遭受摧残迫害的痛苦，深深感到互相尊重民族文化、促进各族文化交流与发展的可贵。正是因为如此，广大华侨对于印度尼西亚有势力的集团策动的摧残华侨教育的做法异常不满，他们要求印度尼西亚当局制止这种迫害活动。
