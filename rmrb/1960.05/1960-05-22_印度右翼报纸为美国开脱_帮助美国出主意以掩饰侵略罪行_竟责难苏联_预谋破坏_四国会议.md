Xinhua News Agency, May 20th, Dispatch from New Delhi: A host of Indian right-wing newspapers continue to rabidly attack Khrushchev's solemn stance of condemning the aggressive policies of the United States, and offer advice to the United States to exculpate it from the crime of sabotaging the summit conference.

The "Hindustan Times" on the 19th attacked Khrushchev, saying that "despite the admittedly serious provocation by the United States," Khrushchev was not good at distinguishing between "broad matters" and "relatively minor espionage activities." This newspaper further flattered the United States by saying that "it is completely unrealistic to expect the United States to make the kind of apology that Khrushchev demands."

The Hindi-language "Hindustan Daily" attacked the Soviet Union on the 19th for adopting a "stubborn attitude" and regretted for the United States that the United States did not use "sober diplomacy" in the spy plane incident. This newspaper also exonerated the United States from the crime of sabotaging the Four-Power Summit and attacked the Soviet Union for "not blocking the road to negotiation." It clamored that "if Russia's enthusiasm for peace is very strong, then it should not attach so much importance to this incident."

The "Indian Express," which has always reversed black and white, absurdly insisted that the failure of the summit conference was "premeditated by the Soviet Union," regardless of the United States' responsibility for sabotaging the Four-Power Summit.

This Indian newspaper also offered advice to Eisenhower, saying that Eisenhower made the wrong move; he was too frank when he could have turned a deaf ear, and he could have denied any connection with the errant pilot; if espionage activities had to continue, there was no need to announce it in this way.

The "Times of India" also helped U.S. imperialism come up with ideas. It said that Washington "certainly should not have gone so far as to declare that aerial espionage is an integral, consistent, and unchanging part of U.S. foreign policy."

    印度右翼报纸为美国开脱
    帮助美国出主意以掩饰侵略罪行
    竟责难苏联“预谋破坏”四国会议
    据新华社20日讯　新德里消息：一大堆印度右翼报纸继续猖狂攻击赫鲁晓夫谴责美国侵略政策的严正立场，并且为美国献策以开脱它破坏首脑会议的罪责。
    19日的“印度斯坦时报”攻击赫鲁晓夫说，“尽管美国进行了公认为严重的挑衅”，但是赫鲁晓夫不善于区别“范围广阔的事情”和“较为次要的间谍活动”。这家报纸还进一步讨好美国说，“如果期望美国作出像赫鲁晓夫要求的那种道歉是完全不现实的”。
    印地文的“印度斯坦日报”19日攻击苏联采取“固执的态度”，并且为美国惋惜说，美国在间谍飞机事件上没有运用“清醒的外交”。这家报纸还为美国开脱破坏四国首脑会议的罪责，攻击苏联“不应该堵塞谈判的道路”。它叫嚣说，“如果俄国对和平的热诚很强烈的话，那么它就不应该这样重视这个事件”。
    一贯颠倒黑白的“印度快报”居然不顾美国破坏四国首脑会议的责任，荒唐地硬说首脑会议的失败是“苏联预谋的”。
    这家印度报纸还为艾森豪威尔献策说，艾森豪威尔走错了棋，在他本来可以装聋作哑的时候却直言不讳，本来是可以否认同那位犯错误的驾驶员有任何关系的；假如间谍活动不得不继续，那也没有必要这样宣布。
    “印度时报”也帮助美帝国主义出主意。它说，华盛顿“肯定不该做到宣布空中间谍活动是美国外交政策不可分割的一贯不变的一部分的地步”。
