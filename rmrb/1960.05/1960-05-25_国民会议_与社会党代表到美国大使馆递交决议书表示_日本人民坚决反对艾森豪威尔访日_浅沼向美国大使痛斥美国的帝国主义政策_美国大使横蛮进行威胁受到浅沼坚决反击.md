Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 24th: The "National Conference to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty," composed of one hundred and forty political parties and mass organizations in Japan, dispatched representatives this morning to submit a resolution to the U.S. Embassy in Japan, firmly opposing U.S. President Eisenhower's visit to Japan.

This resolution was passed at the protest rally held in Tokyo on the 21st.

Yesterday afternoon, two hundred representatives from local organizations of the Japanese Socialist Party submitted a request to the U.S. Embassy addressed to the U.S. President, requesting Eisenhower not to visit Japan.

The request stated that the Japanese people are extremely angry at the Kishi Nobusuke government and the Liberal Democratic Party for bringing police into the Diet to force the House of Representatives to "pass" the new "Security Treaty," and are united in demanding the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and the dissolution of the Diet. Under these circumstances, we request that Eisenhower cancel his visit plan.

The "Asahi Shimbun" correspondent in the United States said that because the Japanese Socialist Party has expressed its opposition to Eisenhower's visit to Japan, and there are plans to organize protest demonstrations in Japan when Eisenhower arrives, the U.S. State Department is already "concerned about implementing the President's (Eisenhower's) visit plan to Japan."

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 24th: According to a report in tonight's "Asahi Shimbun," when Chairman Inejiro Asanuma of the Japanese Socialist Party went to the U.S. Embassy today to meet with U.S. Ambassador to Japan Douglas MacArthur II to request the cancellation of U.S. President Eisenhower's visit to Japan, he condemned the U.S.'s imperialist policies.

This morning, Inejiro Asanuma, along with Tadataka Sata, Director of the International Bureau of the Socialist Party, Kiyoshi Katsumada, Director of the Education and Propaganda Bureau, and others, submitted the Socialist Party's formal request to the U.S. Ambassador. The request stated that Eisenhower's visit should be canceled at a time when the Japanese people are extremely angry at the forced "passage" of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" in the Diet. The Socialist Party's request also pointed out: "The Kishi cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party passed the new Security Treaty through a forced vote at a plenary session of the House of Representatives without the attendance of the opposition parties. This is because the government wants to complete the Diet's ratification procedures on June 19, the day Eisenhower arrives in Tokyo." The Socialist Party believes that as a result, Japan's parliamentary system is facing bankruptcy.

Ambassador MacArthur, in accepting the request, said in a very arrogant manner that the Socialist Party should be held responsible for the "chaos" that occurred during the "passage" of the new "Security Treaty" in the Diet, and that "due to the chaos, the police force had to be introduced into the Diet building." When Asanuma refuted this statement, MacArthur even insisted that the Socialist Party Chairman retract a statement he made in Beijing: "American imperialism is the common enemy of the Japanese and Chinese people."

Asanuma firmly reiterated his position. He said that there was no need to retract the statement. He said that the Socialist Party had to call the policies of the United States imperialist policies as they are in reality.

In answering MacArthur's denial of the imperialist nature of U.S. policy, Asanuma emphasized that the United States is currently violating the Japanese Constitution by imposing militaristic policies on Japan. Asanuma emphasized: "This is a violation of the Japanese people's desire to prosper in a peaceful atmosphere."

The "Asahi Shimbun" said that the argument took place in a very excited atmosphere for an hour. Both sides were pounding the table.

    “国民会议”与社会党代表到美国大使馆递交决议书表示
    日本人民坚决反对艾森豪威尔访日
    浅沼向美国大使痛斥美国的帝国主义政策
    美国大使横蛮进行威胁受到浅沼坚决反击新华社24日讯　东京消息：日本一百四十个政党和群众团体组成的“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”今天上午派遣代表把一份决议书交给美国驻日本大使馆，坚决反对美国总统艾森豪威尔访问日本。
    这项决议是21日在东京举行的抗议大会上通过的。
    昨天下午，日本社会党地方组织代表二百人向美国大使馆递交一份给美国总统的要求书，要求艾森豪威尔不要访问日本。
    要求书说，岸信介政府和自由民主党把警察引进国会强使众议院“通过”新“安全条约”，日本人民对这种暴行非常愤慨，正在举国一致要求岸信介内阁下台和解散国会。在这种形势下，我们要求艾森豪威尔取消访问计划。
    “朝日新闻”驻美国记者说，由于日本社会党已经表明反对艾森豪威尔访日，日本国内正在计划在艾森豪威尔到日本时组织抗议示威游行，美国国务院已经“对实行总统（艾森豪威尔）访日计划”感到不安。
    新华社24日讯　东京消息：据“朝日新闻”今晚报道，日本社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎今天到美国大使馆去会见美国驻日大使麦克阿瑟第二要求取消美国总统艾森豪威尔访问日本的计划时，谴责了美国的帝国主义政策。
    浅沼稻次郎同社会党国际局局长佐多忠隆、教育宣传局局长胜间田清一等人今天上午向美国大使递交了社会党的正式要求书。要求书说，正当日本人民对强使国会“通过”新日美“安全条约”感到极度愤慨时，应该取消艾森豪威尔的访问。社会党的要求书还指出：“岸内阁和自由民主党在在野党没有出席的众议院全体会议上用强制表决的办法通过了新安全条约。这是政府想要在艾森豪威尔到达东京的那一天也就是6月19日完成国会批准的手续而进行的。”社会党认为，这样做的结果，日本的议会制度已经面临破产的局面。
    麦克阿瑟大使在接受要求书时以非常蛮横的态度说，社会党应对在国会“通过”新“安全条约”时发生的“混乱”负责，“由于混乱，才不得不把警察部队引入国会大厦”。当浅沼反驳他这种说法的时候，麦克阿瑟甚至于硬要社会党委员长收回他在北京说过的一句话：美帝国主义是日中两国人民的共同敌人。
    浅沼坚决重申他的立场。他说，没有必要收回这句话。他说，社会党不得不把美国的政策按其本来面目称为帝国主义政策。
    浅沼在回答麦克阿瑟否认美国政策的帝国主义性质时强调说，美国目前正在违反日本宪法把军国主义政策强加于日本。浅沼强调说：“这是违反日本人民要求在和平气氛中繁荣的愿望的。”
    “朝日新闻”说，争辩在非常激动的气氛中进行了一个钟头。双方都敲击桌子。
