Xinhua News Agency, 2nd Dispatch: On May 1st, grand rallies and parades were held in twenty provincial capitals and autonomous region capitals including Shenyang, Xi'an, Harbin, Hohhot, Nanjing, as well as medium and small cities across the country, to warmly celebrate International Labor Day.

The cities that held grand rallies and parades on May 1st were Harbin, Changchun, Shenyang, Hohhot, Taiyuan, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Yinchuan, Xining, Urumqi, Jinan, Nanjing, Hefei, Hangzhou, Fuzhou, Zhengzhou, Changsha, Nanchang, Nanning, Lhasa, and famous industrial cities such as Anshan.

On May Day, all cities were decorated with lanterns and colored hangings, and red flags fluttered, filled with a festive atmosphere. The working people of our country, who have completed the main targets of the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule, held unprecedentedly extensive and enthusiastic rallies and parades. The number of people participating in rallies and parades in various provincial capitals, autonomous region capitals, and important industrial cities was generally over 100,000. In Shenyang, 800,000 people participated, in Xi'an 600,000, and in Nanjing and Harbin 500,000. In Hohhot, Xining, Changsha, Jinan, Changchun, Zhengzhou, and Anshan, the number of participants in the celebration rallies and parades ranged from 300,000 to over 400,000. In Lhasa, 30,000 Tibetan and Han people held a celebration meeting. People shouted slogans such as "Celebrate International Labor Day!" "Long live the great unity of the people of the world!" "Long live Marxism Leninism!" "Long live the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!" "People from Asia, Africa, and Latin America, unite and overthrow imperialism!" People warmly hailed the great victory of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, and hailed the great achievements of the technical innovation and technical revolution. The parade also carried many charts and models, reporting to the leaders of the Party and the government on the achievements they had made on various fronts, expressing their determination to strive to complete half of the annual plan in the first half of the year and strive to over fulfill this year's national economic plan.

Party and government leaders in various regions spent the festival with the masses and participated in local celebration rallies and get-togethers. Soviet and other socialist countries’ experts who were assisting our country's construction, as well as foreign guests visiting various places, also celebrated the festival with the local masses.

Party and government leaders in various regions also gave speeches at the local celebration rallies. In these speeches, they talked about the excellent domestic and international situation, exposed the conspiracy of US imperialism's fake peace and genuine war preparations, and expressed firm support for the national and democratic struggles against imperialism and colonialism of the people of South Korea, Japan, Algeria, Turkey, Latin America, and various African countries.

In the past four months, the masses of workers and staff who have made great achievements on various fronts reported their production achievements and the fruitful results of carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution movements to the Party and the government when they held celebration rallies and parades, and expressed their determination to strive to complete half of the annual plan in the first half of the year, strive to over fulfill the annual plan this year, and lay a good foundation for the continued leap forward next year. Tens of thousands of workers in Harbin paraded with giant charts and various models. After completing the state production plan for the first quarter fifteen days ahead of schedule, they completed the production tasks for April in 28 days. Moreover, due to the widespread carrying out of technical innovation and technical revolution movements, the degree of automation, semi-automation, mechanization, and semi-mechanization of factories throughout the city has been greatly improved. Workers in Lanzhou, an emerging industrial city, enthusiastically participated in the parade. The staff and workers of the Lanzhou Refinery, who had completed the first quarter's production plan ahead of schedule, put forward more than 7,000 technical innovation proposals in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, and completed the April production plan three days ahead of schedule. Now all the staff and workers of the plant are determined to achieve a "full house red" in May. Wang Kuizhong, a gas worker at the No. 2 blast furnace of Anshan Iron and Steel Works, brought the good news of production to the people participating in the Anshan celebration activities: On the eve of May Day, the utilization coefficient of the No. 2 blast furnace broke through the 2.0 mark, creating the highest record of utilization coefficient for atmospheric pressure blast furnaces. The huge charts and models carried by the workers in Zhengzhou showed that they had overfulfilled the national industrial production plan for April by 10%. The staff and workers of various factories and mines in Jinan reported their new achievements to the celebration meeting. The workers of Jinan Automobile Factory newly manufactured an eight-and-a-half-ton "Type 150" truck on May Day. The staff and workers of Jinan Iron and Steel Plant rolled out high-quality steel plates for the first time, and they were determined to create more new varieties after the festival. More than 30,000 workers from Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company and nearby factories held a celebration meeting in the Workers' Cultural Palace in the northern suburbs of Taiyuan. More than 20,000 workers from Taiyuan Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant, which was officially put into production on May Day, held a celebration meeting to celebrate International Labor Day, the plant's commissioning, and the establishment of the urban people's commune. The shift workers who had just finished work reported to the conference with the achievement of overfulfilling the shift production task. In the parade in Nanjing, the achievement plaques carried by the workers of Nanjing Yuejin Iron and Steel Plant showed that this iron and steel plant had not been established on May Day the year before, and last year's May Day was just an iron smelting production unit. This year's May Day they have become a small iron and steel complex with seven workshops including iron smelting, steel rolling, and coking. Recently, after technical transformation, the output of the plant's small blast furnace has risen rapidly, and the utilization coefficient is often above two, showing the powerful power of the "small foreign groups" of the iron and steel industry. Street industry is a new force on the industrial front in Nanjing. At present, the output value has accounted for one-quarter of the city's total industrial output value. Not long ago, these factory workers were still street residents. Today, they have reported their production achievements to the people of the city as workers with heroic strides. On May Day, the staff and workers in Urumqi used thousands of new machines, models, and charts to set up a huge technical innovation exhibition hall on People's Square. More than 100 factories, mines, agencies, and schools in ten major systems including metallurgy, petroleum, machinery, and agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and water conservancy throughout the city presented approximately 6,000 new inventions and creations in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement to the Party to celebrate May Day.

The parade of members of the urban people's communes was a prominent feature of this year's May Day celebrations in various places. Thousands of workers in community-run industries and service industries, who not long ago were still housewives, constantly raised their arms and shouted: "Long live the urban people's communes!" "Long live the Communist Party!" They held up various charts and models illustrating the development of production and the improvement of living conditions after the establishment of the urban people's communes, fully demonstrating the incomparable superiority and strong vitality of the urban people's communes. In the early days of the establishment of the Hongqi People's Commune in Lixia District, Jinan City in 1958, there were only dozens of industrial products with a monthly output value of only more than 3,000 yuan. By March of this year, the number of products had increased to more than 300, and the output value had risen to 350,600 yuan. More than 40,000 members of the Julong People's Commune in Taiyuan City held a celebration meeting with joy. More than 5,000 workers in community-run factories, wearing brand-new work clothes, participated in the celebration meeting carrying the products they produced. This commune has established more than 230 factories, and more than 90% of housewives have participated in production. There are more than 1,600 kinds of their products. The factories and mines in the Xincheng Industrial and Mining Area of Yinchuan officially established the People's Commune on May Day, and named the commune the "May Day" People's Commune. People happily called this year's festival "double happiness." The production charts carried by tens of thousands of members of the urban people's communes in Zhengzhou showed that the total output value of the industries run by the urban people's communes in the city in the first quarter of this year was equal to the total output value of the whole year last year. In Changchun City, more than 30,000 members of the Dongfeng People's Commune centered on Changchun No. 1 Automobile Manufacturing Plant—workers and family members of the automobile plant, workers of "satellite" factories serving the automobile plant, and members of the agricultural management area—celebrated the festival together. Since the establishment of the Jiangbei People's Commune in Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, one year ago, it has established 55 factories. Last year's total industrial output value increased eleven times compared with 1958. This year, in just eighty days, the total output value exceeded the total output value of the whole year last year. The members held up these inspiring achievement plaques and held a celebration parade. Various charts carried by the members of the urban people's communes in Tangshan City, Hebei Province, show that the urban people's communes have shown great power soon after their establishment. In the past few months, various urban people's communes have successively established more than 2,000 street factories, trial-produced 257 kinds of products, and the total output value reached 150 million yuan, which is equivalent to eight times the total output value of Tangshan's street industry last year.

On the day of the festival, grand get-togethers were held in various places. The squares, parks, cultural palaces, theaters, cinemas and other public places in various cities were crowded with joyous people that day.

Mass sports performances and competitions were held in Zhengzhou, Jinan, Hefei, Taiyuan, Harbin, Anshan and other cities. Professional and amateur troupes performed wonderful cultural programs. Some cities also held firework displays and poetry contests, recitation meetings, etc. in brightly lit squares and parks with flowers in full bloom.
