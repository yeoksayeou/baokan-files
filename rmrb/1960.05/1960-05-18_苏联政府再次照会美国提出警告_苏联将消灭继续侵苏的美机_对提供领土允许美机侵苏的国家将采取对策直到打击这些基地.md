Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 16th: The Soviet government lodged another note with the United States regarding the intrusion of American aircraft into Soviet airspace, stating that if American aircraft continue to attempt to violate Soviet airspace, the invading aircraft will be immediately destroyed.

    This note is a response to the U.S. note of May 12th. It was delivered on May 16th to U.S. Chargé d'Affaires in the Soviet Union, Mr. Freers, by Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Firyubin.

    The Soviet note points out that the policy, announced by the U.S. government as its policy orientation, of deliberate provocations and deliberate, blatant violations of international law and the sovereignty of nations—including the important principle of the inviolability of national territory—not only exacerbates tensions and mutual distrust between countries, but also creates a dangerous situation for the cause of peace.

    The note points out that the U.S. Secretary of State's statement on May 9th "cannot but be regarded as an act of aggression." The attempt to defend and legitimize hostile actions is nothing less than advocating aggression.

    The note emphasizes that the Soviet Union will take countermeasures against the governments of certain countries that disregard the interests of their own people by providing their territory for the establishment of American military bases from which aircraft are secretly dispatched into Soviet airspace, up to the point of striking these bases.

    The Soviet government believes that it is time for the U.S. government to not just pay lip service, but to actually demonstrate its concern for easing international tensions, first and foremost by condemning the provocative acts of its own aircraft against the Soviet Union and abandoning its declared policy of infringing upon the airspace of other countries, which threatens the cause of peace.

    The note concludes by saying that the Soviet government remains committed to restoring good relations between the Soviet Union and the United States. Whether the obstacles currently standing in the way of achieving this goal can be removed depends on the United States, and only on the United States.

    苏联政府再次照会美国提出警告
    苏联将消灭继续侵苏的美机
    对提供领土允许美机侵苏的国家将采取对策直到打击这些基地
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科16日讯：苏联政府就美国飞机侵犯苏联领空一事再次照会美国说，如果美国飞机继续企图侵犯苏联领空，那么，入侵的飞机将立即被消灭。
    这一份照会是答复美国5月12日的照会的。已由苏联外交部副部长费留宾于16日交给美国驻苏联临时代办弗里尔斯。
    苏联照会指出，美国政府作为它的政策方针而宣布的蓄意挑衅、蓄意蛮横地破坏国际法和各国主权——其中包括国家领土不可侵犯的重要原则——的政策不仅加剧了紧张局势、国与国之间的互不信任，而且给和平事业造成危险的局面。
    照会指出，美国国务卿5月9日的声明，“不能不认为是一种侵略行为”。为敌对的行动辩护并使它合法化的企图不是别的，正是鼓吹侵略。
    照会强调指出，某些国家的政府无视本国人民的利益，提供本国领土建立美国军事基地，从那里向苏联领空暗派飞机，苏联对这些国家的政府将采取对策，直到打击这些基地。
    苏联政府认为，使美国政府不只是空喊，而是实际表现出对缓和国际紧张局势的关心，首先是谴责本国飞机对苏联的挑衅行为，放弃他们宣布的威胁和平事业的侵犯别国领空的政策，这已经是时候了。
    照会最后说，苏联政府仍然主张在苏联和美国之间恢复良好的关系。目前在达到这一目的的道路上所形成的障碍是否能消除，这要取决于美国，而且只是取决于美国。
