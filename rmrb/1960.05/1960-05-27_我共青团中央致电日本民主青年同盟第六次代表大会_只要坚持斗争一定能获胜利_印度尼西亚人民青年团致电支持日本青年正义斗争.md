　　Xinhua News Agency, May 26th. The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League today sent a telegram to the Sixth Congress of the Japan Democratic Youth League, extending warm respects to the League members and the broad masses of Japanese youth who are standing at the forefront of the struggle to smash the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty.
　　The Sixth Congress of the Japan Democratic Youth League will be held from the 27th to the 29th. The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League expressed warm congratulations on the convening of the congress in the telegram, which stated: "Since its establishment, under the leadership of the Japanese Communist Party, the Japan Democratic Youth League has inherited the glorious tradition of the Japanese revolutionary youth movement, united the broad masses of Japanese youth, held high the banner of opposing U.S. imperialism and opposing the revival of Japanese militarism, and waged unremitting struggles for independence, peace, democracy, neutrality, youth rights, and social progress. In recent years, the Japan Democratic Youth League has mobilized the broad masses of Japanese youth and the Japanese people to carry out a vigorous struggle against the Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty,' to promote Japan-China friendship, and to oppose the conspiracy of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries to create 'two Chinas,' making contributions to defending peace in Asia and the world. Chinese youth fully support your just struggle and are excited and encouraged by the victories you have achieved.
　　"The general trend of the current international situation is developing in a direction favorable to peace, socialism, and the anti-imperialist struggle, and the East wind continues to prevail over the West wind. However, U.S. imperialism is not reconciled to its failure and is stepping up its arms expansion and war preparation schemes. Recently, it even sent U-2 spy planes to invade and provoke the Soviet Union, destroying the Four-Power Summit Conference single-handedly, which has aroused the angry condemnation of the Chinese people and the people of the world. This incident once again thoroughly exposed that U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the people of the world. The recent brutal act of the Kishi Nobusuke reactionary clique in forcibly 'passing' the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty cannot save its fate but will only accelerate its own demise. The Chinese people and the people of the world resolutely support the Japanese people and youth's patriotic and just struggle against the United States. Although there will be difficulties and twists and turns on the road of struggle, as long as we strengthen unity and persist in struggle, final victory will surely belong to the Japanese people. We sincerely wish the Japan Democratic Youth League, under the leadership of the Japanese Communist Party, will unite, educate, and lead the broad masses of Japanese youth to achieve greater success in the struggle to completely smash the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty and strive for independence, peace, democracy, neutrality, and youth rights."
　　Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 25th. The People's Youth League, the most influential youth organization in Indonesia, sent a telegram to the "Joint Struggle Conference of Youth and Students to Prevent the Revision of the Security Treaty" in Tokyo on the 24th, stating that the one million members of the People's Youth League fully support the just and heroic struggle of the Japanese people and youth against the ratification of the Japan-U.S. military treaty.
　　The telegram pointed out that the struggle of the Japanese people will surely achieve final victory.

    我共青团中央致电日本民主青年同盟第六次代表大会
    只要坚持斗争一定能获胜利
    印度尼西亚人民青年团致电支持日本青年正义斗争
    新华社26日讯　中国共产主义青年团中央委员会今天打电报给日本民主青年同盟第六次代表大会，向站在粉碎日美军事同盟条约的斗争前列的盟员和广大日本青年致热烈的敬意。
    日本民主青年同盟第六次代表大会将于27日到29日举行。共青团中央在电报中对大会的召开表示热烈的祝贺，电报说：“日本民主青年同盟自成立以来，在日本共产党领导下，继承了日本革命青年运动的光荣传统，团结广大日本青年，高举反对美帝国主义、反对复活日本军国主义的旗帜，为争取独立、和平、民主、中立，为争取青年权利和社会进步进行了不懈的斗争。近年来日本民主青年同盟又动员日本广大青年和日本人民一道开展了轰轰烈烈的反对日美‘安全条约’、促进日中友好和反对美日反动派制造‘两个中国’阴谋的斗争，为保卫亚洲和世界的和平作出了贡献。中国青年全力支持你们的正义斗争，并为你们所取得的胜利感到兴奋鼓舞。
      “当前国际形势的总的趋势是朝着有利于和平、社会主义和反帝斗争的方向发展，东风继续压倒西风。但是美帝国主义不甘心于自己的失败，加紧扩军备战阴谋活动，最近竟派U—2间谍飞机对苏联进行侵略和挑衅，一手破坏四国首脑会议，引起了中国人民和全世界人民的愤怒谴责。这一事件再一次彻底暴露了美帝国主义是全世界人民最凶恶的敌人。最近岸信介反动集团用暴力强行‘通过’日美军事同盟条约的残暴行为，并不能挽救它的命运，只能加速它自己的灭亡。中国人民和全世界人民坚决支持日本人民和青年的反美爱国正义斗争，尽管在斗争的道路上还会有困难和曲折，但是只要加强团结，坚持斗争，最后胜利一定属于日本人民。“我们谨祝日本民主青年同盟在日本共产党领导下，团结、教育和带领日本广大青年为彻底粉碎日美军事同盟条约、在争取独立、和平、民主、中立和青年权利的斗争中取得更大的成就。”
    新华社雅加达25日电　印度尼西亚最有影响的青年组织人民青年团24日致电东京“青年和学生阻止修改安全条约共同斗争会议”说，人民青年团的一百万团员全力支持日本人民和青年反对批准日美军事条约的正义和英勇的斗争。
    电报指出，日本人民的斗争必将获得最后胜利。
