    The Fifth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union has concluded. At this session, Comrade Khrushchev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, delivered a report on the abolition of taxes on workers and staff, other measures to improve the people's welfare, and the international situation. After a warm discussion, the meeting adopted Comrade Khrushchev's report. The Chinese people feel heartfelt joy at the Soviet government's measures to further improve the people's living standards and express firm support for the solemn position of the Soviet government on the international situation as clarified by Comrade Khrushchev.
    The Soviet government's decision to gradually abolish wage taxes for workers and staff, issue new currency, and complete the transition of all workers and staff to a seven- to six-hour workday in 1960 reflects the enormous surge in the Soviet national economy and demonstrates the boundless concern of the Soviet Communist Party and government for the welfare of the people. The significant overfulfillment of the 1959 industrial production tasks and the tremendous achievements in agricultural production during the first year of the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan for developing the national economy guarantee further improvement in the living standards of the Soviet people based on continued development of production. The Soviet government is taking measures to launch a nationwide movement to further develop production, increase labor productivity, reduce costs, fully utilize existing potential, and increase the accumulation of the socialist economy. The Soviet government's decision to gradually abolish resident taxes is based on first increasing the wage income of low-wage workers and staff. At the same time, measures are being implemented to increase the minimum wage, so that the lives of the vast number of lower-income workers and staff are first improved, and the wage gap between low-wage and high-wage workers is narrowed. These benefits enjoyed by the Soviet people are unimaginable in any capitalist country. Capitalist countries always increase people's taxes without limit, and place the burden of taxes on the working people. The tax burden on the vast majority of people in many capitalist countries is becoming heavier and heavier due to the implementation of policies of arms expansion and war preparation. For example, the total amount of tax revenue in the United States has increased sevenfold in the past twenty years. In the 1960 fiscal year, the average annual tax burden per person in the United States increased by 63 US dollars compared to the previous year. Contrary to the increasing consolidation of Soviet currency and credit, capitalist countries are filled with voices of inflation and currency devaluation. Now one US dollar is only equivalent to 48 cents in 1940. In his report, Comrade Khrushchev cited abundant materials from various aspects, vividly illustrating the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system. The socialist system guarantees that social production can develop at a high speed, enabling the Soviet Union to surpass all capitalist countries in labor productivity in the near future, to catch up with and surpass the United States in the output of major industrial and agricultural products calculated on a per capita basis, and at the same time to guarantee the continuous improvement of the living standards of the working people and the gradual reduction of working hours. This makes socialism increasingly attractive to the people of capitalist countries.
    In his report at the Supreme Soviet session, Comrade Khrushchev stated the Soviet government's solemn position on the current international situation. He talked about the upcoming East-West summit meeting and the Soviet government's attitude towards this meeting, reiterating that the Soviet Union continues to work to ease international tensions and strive for the summit meeting to reach agreements on issues that have already matured. In his report, Comrade Khrushchev expressed serious condemnation of the US imperialists for insisting on continuing the Cold War and arms race, and even engaging in direct provocations against the Soviet Union. He announced that on April 9 and May 1, US aircraft for military reconnaissance repeatedly violated Soviet airspace. Among them, the US aircraft that intruded into the Soviet Union on May 1 was shot down by the Soviet air defense forces. Comrade Khrushchev pointed out, "This aggressive action taken by the United States against the Soviet Union once again was predetermined to be carried out on the eve of the government summit. This was done to put pressure on us, attempting to intimidate us with their non-existent military superiority." Khrushchev pointed out that on the eve of World War II, Hitler's planes repeatedly intruded into the Soviet Union, followed by an attack on the Soviet Union. Hitler finally experienced the power of the Soviet Union firsthand. Khrushchev warned the US ruling group: "The Soviet Union has the ability to strike back at all those who attempt to use pressure to achieve a solution favorable to the aggressors."
    This blatant act of aggression by the United States against the Soviet Union has not only aroused great indignation among the entire Soviet people, but also aroused great indignation among the Chinese people and the people of socialist countries. The socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is a great and unbreakable whole. The US imperialist provocation against the Soviet Union is a provocation against the entire socialist camp, that is, a provocation against the 650 million Chinese people. We fully support the protests and condemnations of the Soviet government and people against the US authorities.
    This military provocation by the United States against the Soviet Union is by no means an accidental event, but a continuation of the aggressive and war policies consistently pursued by the US ruling group for a long time. This policy reflects the nature of US imperialism. Although the US ruling group, under the situation where the East wind continues to prevail over the West wind and the forces of peace outweigh the forces of war, has been forced to express certain "peaceful" gestures, its aggressive and war policies have not changed, and its imperialist nature has not and never will change. Under the guise of its peaceful gestures, US imperialism continues to intensify its expansion of military strength and preparation for new wars. During the period of the recent two intrusions of US aircraft into Soviet airspace, the United States simultaneously intensified international tensions and engaged in aggressive activities in all aspects around the world.
    The US arms expansion and war preparation activities have never stopped. On April 6, after meeting with officials from the US Department of Defense, Eisenhower decided to accelerate the development of "Atlas" intercontinental missiles and submarines launching "Polaris" missiles. The United States is also stepping up the development of "Lightning" missiles launched by aircraft, and will gradually establish twenty-three aviation squadrons carrying such missiles starting in 1965. In April alone, the United States conducted seventeen missile launch tests of various types. From May 3, the United States carried out a three-day "civil defense" exercise for atomic warfare within the country.
    The United States is continuing to strengthen its military blocs, accelerate its war deployments, and conduct military exercises. On April 28, the United States and the Central Treaty Organization countries held a meeting in Tehran, Iran, to plan the establishment of a joint command of this aggressive bloc. Subsequently, at the meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Ministerial Council held in early May, US Secretary of State Herter again requested that the North Atlantic countries "provide all resources" to engage in the "ten-year plan" of arms expansion and war preparation. In early May, the United States successively transported a large number of cannons, rocket launchers, and other weapons to the US naval base in Guantanamo, Cuba. The US Department of Defense announced that it would send an army air transport unit of "five atomic unit divisions" to Okinawa in June. On May 5, the US House of Representatives approved the establishment of "Mas" missile bases in Okinawa and West Germany. From March 28 to April 8, the United States, together with Thailand, the Philippines, South Korea, and the Chiang Kai-shek Group, held the so-called "US-Asia Airborne Weapons Annual Exercise" at the US military base in the Philippines. On April 28, the navies and air forces of the United States and seven countries of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization conducted a military exercise called "Sea Lion" in the waters of Bangkok and Manila. On May 4, the US occupying forces in West Berlin held an atomic warfare exercise.
    The United States is also continuing to vigorously support the militarist forces in West Germany and Japan, the two sources of war. After the United States announced that it would supply West Germany with atomic rocket weapons worth 800 million marks this year to accelerate West Germany's atomic armament, West Germany plans to establish thirty-three atomic missile battalions within this year.
    On April 15, the United States and Japan also formally reached an agreement to help Japan produce 200 "Lockheed" jet fighters. With the support of the United States, the Kishi Nobusuke government, in disregard of the opposition of the Japanese people, is forcing the Japanese parliament to approve the new Japan-US Security Treaty. The US imperialists and the Japanese reactionaries collude with each other to revive the forces of Japanese militarism, posing an increasingly serious threat to peace in the Far East.
    The US ruling group also continues to pursue a policy of arbitrarily interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. The United States' activities against the Cuban revolution have increased unabated. On April 29, the Cuban government announced the cracking down on a counter-revolutionary organization directed and funded by the United States. At the end of April, the United States instigated the Guatemalan government to sever diplomatic relations with Cuba, and requested the Organization of American States to investigate the so-called "invasion" of Guatemala by Cuba, in order to create an excuse for its armed intervention in Cuba. On April 20, the United States and Trujillo, the Dominican dictator it supported, again instigated an armed rebellion in Venezuela, attempting to subvert the Venezuelan government. Recently, when the South Korean people rose up against the reactionary rule of Syngman Rhee, the United States first supported Syngman Rhee's bloody suppression of the people. When Syngman Rhee had to step down under the pressure of the people, it supported another new puppet, Heo Jeong, to replace the old puppet, while still claiming that Syngman Rhee, the public enemy of the South Korean people, was the so-called "father of the nation" of South Korea. The United States is also playing a two-faced trick of both hard and soft tactics towards the patriotic struggle of the Turkish people against the US-backed dictator Menderes, continuing to support the bloody rule of the Turkish reactionaries, attempting to extinguish the anger of the Turkish people.
    The attacks and provocations by the United States against socialist countries are also becoming more frequent. US Secretary of State Herter openly slandered the Soviet Union on May 4 for carrying out "a struggle for conspiracy rule" under the "guise of peaceful coexistence." On April 15, US Undersecretary of State Dillon greatly slandered the Soviet Union for "increasingly urgently hoping" to realize "expansion ambitions." On May 2, the US House of Representatives even passed a resolution requiring Eisenhower to raise the issue of restoring the "basic freedom" of Eastern European socialist countries at the upcoming East-West summit meeting. US Secretary of the Army Bruck falsely accused our country on May 3 of being a "rampaging tiger." The United States continues to carry out military provocations and war threats against China. The US Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces in the Pacific, Felt, even threatened in late April that "there is always a danger of all limited wars with the Communist Chinese on the Taiwan issue." US aircraft and warships continue to constantly violate our country's territorial waters and airspace. From September 7, 1958 to April 28 this year, such provocative acts have reached ninety-four times. US aircraft also constantly harass our country through the Sino-Burmese border and the Sino-Indian border.
    These activities of the US imperialists to intensify international tensions happened precisely on the eve of the summit meeting, which cannot but arouse people's vigilance. Originally, the US government headed by Eisenhower was against holding the summit meeting. Only after the US aggressive and war policies ran into snags everywhere and the military superiority was lost did the US government reluctantly agree to hold the summit meeting. However, from the above-mentioned series of US activities, people can clearly see that the US government has no sincerity towards the summit meeting. Responsible officials of the US government have recently repeatedly issued "Cold War" remarks, advocating "policy of strength," and refusing to reach agreements on current major international disputes. US Secretary of State Herter on April 4 and US Vice President Nixon on April 25 both flatly rejected the Soviet Union's proposal for complete and thorough disarmament. Herter emphasized: "The military forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and our other collective arrangements will remain the cornerstone of our national policy." And Eaton, the head of the US delegation to the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee meeting, openly said on April 29: "We will maintain those troops, those armaments, and those weapons that we believe are necessary to defend ourselves and those countries that are willing to be our allies and our alliance." US Undersecretary of State Dillon clamored on April 20 to throw the concept of coexistence "into the garbage heap." He threatened that the United States "will not accept any arrangement that may lead to the abandonment of West Berlin." He insisted that the "only practical way to solve the German problem is to hold free elections." Since responsible officials of the US government insist on such a stubborn position, they have tried their best to spread a pessimistic atmosphere about the summit meeting. Herter said on April 4: "If anyone expects to achieve remarkable achievements at the summit meeting, he may be disappointed," and he declared on May 6: "One should not hold excessive hope of reaching an agreement (at the summit meeting)."
    These anti-peaceful propositions of Herter, Nixon, Dillon and others, which challenge the people of all countries in the world, are not only the propositions of Nixon and Herter, but also the propositions of US President Eisenhower himself, who once pretended to be a "peace person." At a press conference on April 27, Eisenhower publicly stated that the talks by Herter and others clarified the direction of US government foreign policy. It was Eisenhower himself who ordered the resumption of underground nuclear tests on May 7. Eisenhower even announced that his participation in the summit meeting could not exceed seven days. If the talks continued after seven days, only Vice President Nixon could participate. As Comrade Khrushchev said, there is little reason to hope that the US government is genuinely seeking concrete solutions. It is clear that the direction of the foreign policy of the US ruling group, represented by Eisenhower, is not to seek to ease international tensions, but to insist on continuing the Cold War and the arms race, and even to carry out direct provocations. This foreign policy precisely reflects the interests of US monopoly capital.
    All this powerfully shows that the aggressive nature of US imperialism has not changed and cannot be changed. Although the balance of power in the world has now undergone fundamental changes, and the advantage is no longer on the side of imperialism, but on the side of socialism, on the side of the people of all countries against imperialism, and on the side of the forces defending world peace, imperialism can no longer realize its aggression, plunder, and war plans as it did in the past, but imperialism is still imperialism, and a wolf is still a wolf. Sometimes, even if a wolf puts on sheep's clothing, its purpose is still to eat sheep. The people of the world long for the easing of international tensions and world peace, but US imperialism is keen on intensifying the "Cold War" and keen on expanding arms and preparing for war. In the past period, the Soviet government has made a series of efforts to ease the international situation, and has adopted a patient, conciliatory, and tolerant attitude on the West Berlin issue, at the disarmament conference, at the conference on banning nuclear tests, and on other occasions, striving to create a favorable atmosphere before the summit meeting. However, all this was regarded by the US imperialists, who are jackals by nature, as a sign of Soviet weakness. Responsible officials of the US government, headed by Eisenhower, not only did not show a corresponding conciliatory attitude, but also intensified the arms expansion and war preparation while also putting the Cold War machine into full gear, until they repeatedly sent planes into the Soviet Union to carry out direct provocations. Comrade Khrushchev said, "The Soviet people and the Soviet government have always expressed peace and friendship to the United States in the past and now. But we have received a mean and ungrateful reward."
    Since the aggressive activities of US imperialism are becoming more and more frantic, then all peace-loving people in the world must raise their vigilance a hundredfold in order to safeguard world peace. The ultimate goal of US imperialism is to dominate the world and enslave the people of all countries. In order to achieve this goal, US imperialism will inevitably suppress the national democratic movements and all progressive and peaceful forces in all countries of the world, it will inevitably expand its aggressive forces everywhere, and it will inevitably regard the powerful fortress for defending world peace—the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union—as a thorn in its side. In order to achieve this goal, US imperialism promotes the "policy of strength," the "brinkmanship policy," and even openly launches wars of aggression. When its war policy is hindered, it pretends to "peaceful evolution" and "peaceful victory" in order to buy time and accelerate the pace of arms expansion and war preparation. Therefore, the people of the world should neither panic and despair in the face of the US imperialist military threat and military aggression, nor have illusions and slacken their fighting will because of its sweet words.
    Marxism-Leninism believes that aggression and war are the nature of imperialism. Recognizing this indisputable and never-outdated truth has particularly important practical significance for the struggle to defend world peace today. In order to ease international tensions and safeguard world peace, all peace-loving people in the world must strengthen the exposure and strengthen the struggle against all aggressive activities, arms expansion and war preparation activities, and peace conspiracies of the imperialist group headed by the United States. World peace is the most important international issue currently related to the vital interests of the people of all countries. The Soviet Union, China, and all socialist countries have consistently pursued a peaceful foreign policy and worked hard to safeguard world peace. Now, because the forces for maintaining peace in the world, especially the strength of the socialist camp, are unprecedentedly strong, the possibility of preventing a world war exists. As Comrade Khrushchev pointed out, "We want peace. But our commitment to peace does not mean begging for peace." It should be known that the imperialists have never been willing to coexist peacefully. They always seize every opportunity to expand and aggress, and seize every opportunity to bully and threaten the people of all countries. Isn't the US aircraft's provocation against the Soviet Union the latest and most vivid proof? Unless we endure bullying and allow imperialism to run amok, we must expose and fight back against the imperialist aggression conspiracies. The more thoroughly the imperialist aggression activities and arms preparation activities are exposed, and the more resolutely the struggle is waged, the more isolated imperialism becomes, the more guaranteed the task of easing international tensions and maintaining world peace will be. Conversely, if we evade the struggle, it will only fuel the arrogance of imperialism and make its aggressive activities more rampant. If we hide the evil of imperialism, it can only paralyze the people of all countries, increase the danger of imperialism launching a war, and harm the people of all countries. Now, the aggressive war conspiracies of US imperialism are becoming increasingly more difficult to succeed precisely because more and more people in the world are gradually seeing through the aggressive nature of US imperialism and are increasingly resolutely fighting against it.
    Our pointing out the aggressive nature of imperialism and the fact that US imperialism is taking the lead in arms expansion and war preparation around the world does not mean in the slightest that the US imperialist aggression plans and war plans will succeed, and our position and belief in maintaining peace will waver. On the contrary, we firmly and deeply believe that the future of the struggle of the people of all countries against US imperialism, against aggression policies and war policies, and in defense of world peace is infinitely bright. This is primarily because there is a strong socialist camp, because the unity of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union is unbreakable, and because the socialist countries are united with the oppressed nations, exploited people, and all peace-loving people in the world. The imperialists and their lackeys have tried every means to undermine the unity of the socialist countries and the unity of the socialist countries with the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries. Their despicable and shameless tricks will not achieve their goals. The Chinese people stand firmly with the people of other brotherly countries, are always vigilant against the aggressive conspiracies of US imperialism, and are ready to give them a resolute counterattack at any time. We have declared more than once: We love world peace, but we are not afraid of war. If US imperialism thinks we are easy to bully and dares to invade socialist countries, it will surely be bloodied and bruised. Today is the 15th anniversary of the victory over Hitler's Germany. If US imperialism should embark on the old path of launching a war of aggression by Hitler, then its ending will only be more tragic than the failure of Hitler. We firmly believe that the great socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, together with the workers' movements, national independence movements, peace movements, and all peace-loving forces in all countries, will surely be able to smash the aggression plans and war plans of the imperialist group headed by the United States, and will surely be able to maintain world peace.

### 对苏联的挑衅就是对整个社会主义阵营的挑衅

    对苏联的挑衅就是对整个社会主义阵营的挑衅
    苏联最高苏维埃第五次会议结束了。在这次会议上，苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫同志作了关于取消工人和职员赋税和提高人民福利的其他措施以及国际局势的报告。会议经过热烈讨论，通过了赫鲁晓夫同志的报告。中国人民对于苏联政府为进一步提高人民生活水平的措施感到衷心的喜悦，对于赫鲁晓夫同志所阐明的苏联政府对国际局势的严正立场表示坚决的支持。
    苏联政府决定采取逐步取消职工工资税、发行新货币和在1960年完成全体工人和职员向七—六小时工作日过渡等措施，反映了苏联国民经济的巨大高涨，表明了苏联共产党和政府对人民福利的无限关怀。苏联发展国民经济七年计划的第一年1959年工业生产任务的大大超额完成和农业生产所取得的巨大成就，保证了苏联人民生活水平在继续发展生产的基础上得到进一步的提高。苏联政府正在采取措施，展开一个全民性的运动，争取进一步发展生产，提高劳动生产率，降低成本，充分利用现有潜力，增加社会主义经济的积累。苏联政府决定逐步取消居民税收，是以首先增加低工资职工的工资收入为出发点的，同时还正在实现提高最低工资额的措施，这样就使收入较低的广大职工的生活首先得到更多的改善，而且可以缩小低工资职工和高工资职工之间的工资距离。苏联人民所能享受的这些福利，在任何一个资本主义国家中都是不可想像的。资本主义国家总是无限制地增加人民的赋税，而且把赋税的重担加在劳动人民的身上。许多资本主义国家由于执行扩军备战的政策，广大人民的赋税负担是越来越重了。例如美国近二十年来的税收总额就增加了七倍。在1960财政年度，美国人民每人每年平均负担的捐税就比前一年增加了六十三美元。同苏联货币信用日益巩固相反，在资本主义各国是一片通货膨胀、货币贬值之声。现在一个美元只相当于1940年的四角八分。赫鲁晓夫同志在报告中列举了多方面的丰富的材料，生动地说明社会主义制度对资本主义制度具有无比的优越性。社会主义制度保证社会生产能够高速度地发展，使苏联能够在不久的将来，在劳动生产率方面超过一切资本主义国家，在工农业主要产品的产量按人口平均计算赶上和超过美国，同时也保证劳动人民生活不断地提高，劳动时间逐步地缩短。这就使社会主义对资本主义各国人民具有越来越大的吸引力。
    赫鲁晓夫同志在最高苏维埃会议上的报告中表明了苏联政府对于当前国际局势的严正立场。他谈到即将举行的东西方最高级会议以及苏联政府对这次会议的态度，重申苏联继续为和缓国际紧张局势而努力，争取最高级会议就已经成熟的问题达成协议。赫鲁晓夫同志在报告中对于美帝国主义坚持继续进行冷战和军备竞赛，甚至进行对苏联直接挑衅，表示了严重的谴责。他宣布4月9日和5月1日，美国的以军事侦察为目的的飞机一再侵犯苏联的领空。其中5月1日侵入苏联的美国飞机已被苏联防空部队击落。赫鲁晓夫同志指出，“美国又一次对苏联采取的侵略行动是预先定好在政府首脑会议前夕进行的。这样做是为了对我们施加压力，企图用他们根本不存在的军事优势来恐吓”。赫鲁晓夫指出，在第二次大战前夕希特勒的飞机一再侵入苏联，接着又发动对苏联的进攻，希特勒终于切身体会到了苏联的威力。赫鲁晓夫正告美国统治集团：“对一切企图用压力取得有利于侵略者的解决办法的人，苏联是有能力进行回击的。”
    美国对于苏联的这种明目张胆的侵略行为，不但激起了全体苏联人民的极大愤慨，而且激起了中国人民和社会主义阵营各国人民的极大愤慨。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营是一个伟大的牢不可破的整体。美帝国主义对苏联的挑衅就是对整个社会主义阵营的挑衅，也就是对六亿五千万中国人民的挑衅。我们完全支持苏联政府和人民对美国当局的抗议和谴责。
    美国对苏联的这种军事挑衅，绝不是偶然的事件，而是美国统治集团长期以来一贯奉行的侵略和战争政策的继续。这种政策反映了美帝国主义的本质。虽然美国统治集团在东风继续压倒西风、和平力量超过战争力量形势下曾经被迫表示过某些“和平”姿态，但是它的侵略政策和战争政策并没有改变，它的帝国主义本性没有也永不可能改变。美帝国主义在它的和平姿态掩盖下继续加紧进行扩充军力和准备新战争。就在美国飞机最近两次侵入苏联领空期间，美国同时在世界各地从各个方面加剧国际紧张局势，进行侵略活动。
    美国的扩军备战活动一天也没有停止过。4月6日艾森豪威尔在同美国国防部的官员们开会后决定加速发展“阿特拉斯”洲际导弹和发射“北极星”导弹的潜水艇。美国还在加紧发展用飞机发射的“闪电”导弹，并在1965年起陆续建立起二十三个携带这种导弹的航空中队。在4月一个月内，美国就进行了十七次各种导弹的发射试验。从5月3日起，美国国内进行了为期三天的原子战争的“民防”演习。
    美国正在继续加强它的军事集团，并且加紧它的战争部署，进行军事演习。4月28日美国和中央条约组织国家在伊朗德黑兰举行会议，策划成立这个侵略集团的联合司令部。接着在5月初举行的北大西洋集团部长理事会会议上，美国国务卿赫脱又要求北大西洋国家“拿出全部资源”来从事扩军备战的“十年计划”。5月初，美国把大批大炮、火箭炮和其他武器陆续运到美国在古巴的关塔那摩海军基地。美国国防部宣布将在6月间增派一支“五原子单位师”的陆军空运部队前往冲绳。5月5日，美国众议院批准了在冲绳和西德建立“马斯”导弹基地。从3月28日到4月8日，美国同泰国、菲律宾、南朝鲜和蒋介石集团在菲律宾美军基地举行所谓“美国—亚洲空中武器年度演习”。4月28日美国和东南亚条约组织七个国家的海军和空军在曼谷和马尼拉的海面进行了名为“海狮”的军事演习。5月4日美国驻西柏林的占领军又举行了原子战争演习。
    美国还继续大力扶植西德和日本这两个战争策源地的军国主义势力。在美国宣布今年将把价值八亿马克的原子火箭武器供应西德以加速西德的原子武装之后，西德计划在今年内建立三十三个原子导弹营。
    4月15日，美国和日本也正式达成协议，帮助日本生产二百架“洛克希德”式喷气战斗机。在美国支持下，岸信介政府不顾日本人民的反对，正在迫使日本议会批准新的日美安全条约。美帝国主义和日本反动派相互勾结，复活日本军国主义势力，使远东和平遭到越来越严重的威胁。
    美国统治集团也仍旧执行恣意干涉别国内政的政策。美国反对古巴革命的活动有增无已。4月29日，古巴政府宣布破获了一个由美国指使和接济的反革命组织。4月底，美国唆使危地马拉政府同古巴断绝外交关系，并且要求美洲国家组织调查所谓古巴对危地马拉的“入侵”事件，以为它对古巴进行武装干涉制造借口。4月20日，美国和它所支持的多米尼加独裁者特鲁希略又在委内瑞拉煽起了武装叛变，企图颠覆委内瑞拉政府。最近南朝鲜人民起来反对李承晚反动统治，美国先是支持李承晚对人民的血腥镇压，等到李承晚在人民压力下不得不下台的时候，它又扶植另外一个新傀儡许政来代替旧傀儡，同时仍然宣称南朝鲜的人民公敌李承晚是南朝鲜的所谓“国父”。对于土耳其人民反对美国支持的独裁者曼德列斯的爱国斗争，美国也是在耍软硬兼施的两面手法，继续支持土耳其反动派的血腥统治，企图扑灭土耳其人民的怒火。
    美国对社会主义国家进行的攻击和挑衅也日见频繁。美国国务卿赫脱5月4日公然诽谤苏联在“和平共处的幌子掩盖下”进行“阴谋统治的斗争”。4月15日美国副国务卿狄龙大肆诬蔑苏联“越来越迫切希望”实现“扩张野心”。5月2日，美国众议院甚至通过决议，要艾森豪威尔在即将举行的东西方最高级会议上提出什么恢复东欧社会主义国家的“基本自由”的问题。美国陆军部长布鲁克5月3日诬蔑我国是“猖狂的老虎”。美国继续对中国进行军事挑衅和战争威胁。美国太平洋地区武装部队总司令费耳特4月下旬竟然威胁说，“始终存在着在台湾问题上同共产党中国人发生一切有限战争的危险。”美国飞机和军舰仍然继续不断侵犯我国领海领空。从1958年9月7日到今年4月28日为止，这种挑衅行为已达九十四次。美国飞机还不断通过中缅边境和中印边境对我国进行骚扰。
    美帝国主义的这些加剧国际紧张局势的活动，恰恰发生在最高级会议前夕，这不能不引起人们的警惕。本来，以艾森豪威尔为首的美国政府是反对召开最高级会议的。只是在美国的侵略政策和战争政策到处碰壁、军事优势已经丧失之后，美国政府才勉强同意召开最高级会议。但是，从上述的美国的一系列活动中，人们清楚地看得出美国政府对于最高级会议是没有诚意的。美国政府的负责官员最近一再发表“冷战”言论，鼓吹“实力政策”，拒绝就当前重大国际争端达成协议。美国国务卿赫脱4月4日和美国副总统尼克松4月25日都断然拒绝苏联的全面彻底裁军建议。赫脱强调：“北大西洋公约组织和我们其他集体安排的军事力量将仍然是我们国家的政策的基石”。而美国出席十国裁军委员会会议的代表团团长伊顿4月29日公然说：“我们将保持我们认为保卫我们自己以及愿意作为我们的盟国和我们联盟的那些国家所必需的那些部队，那些军备和那些武器。”美国副国务卿狄龙4月20日更叫嚣把共处观念“抛进垃圾堆”。他扬言美国“不会接受可能导向放弃西柏林的任何安排”。他坚持解决德国问题的“唯一切实可行办法是举行自由选举”。美国政府负责官员既然坚持这样的顽固立场，因此他们竭力散布对最高级会议的悲观空气。赫脱4月4日就说过：“如果任何人期望在最高级会议上获得引人注目的成就，他可能会失望”，他5月6日又宣称：“不应怀抱会（在最高级会议上）达成协议的过分的希望”。
    赫脱、尼克松、狄龙等人的这些向世界各国人民挑战的反和平的主张，不但是尼克松、赫脱这批人的主张，而且也正是曾经冒充“和平人士”的美国总统艾森豪威尔本人的主张。艾森豪威尔在4月27日的一次记者招待会上公开表示，赫脱等的谈话阐明了美国政府外交政策的方针。正是艾森豪威尔自己在5月7日下令恢复地下核试验。艾森豪威尔甚至宣布他参加最高级会议的时间不能超过七天，如果七天以后还继续会谈，就只能由副总统尼克松参加。正如赫鲁晓夫同志所说的，很少有理由可以希望美国政府在真正寻求具体解决办法。很明显，以艾森豪威尔为代表的美国统治集团的对外政策的方针，并不是寻求和缓国际紧张局势，而是要坚持继续进行冷战和军备竞赛，甚至进行直接挑衅。这种对外政策正是反映了美国垄断资本的利益。
    这一切有力地说明，美帝国主义的侵略本性没有改变也不可能改变。虽然现在世界的力量对比已经发生了根本变化，优势已经不在帝国主义方面，而在社会主义方面，在反帝国主义的各国人民方面，在保卫世界和平的力量方面，帝国主义已经不能像过去那样为所欲为地实现它的侵略、掠夺和战争计划，但是，帝国主义毕竟是帝国主义，狼终究是狼。有时候狼尽管披上羊皮，其目的还是为了吃羊。全世界人民渴望和缓国际紧张局势，渴望世界和平，但是美帝国主义却热中于加紧“冷战”，热中于扩军备战。在过去一个时期中，苏联政府为了争取和缓国际局势，曾经作了一系列的努力，在西柏林问题上，在裁军会议上，在禁止核试验会议上，以及在其他场合，都采取了耐心的、和解的、忍让的态度，力求在最高级会议之前创造有利的气氛。但是，这一切竟然被豺狼成性的美帝国主义看成是苏联软弱的表示。以艾森豪威尔为首的美国政府负责官员不但没有表现出相应的和解的态度，反而在加紧扩军备战的同时，又使冷战机器开足马力，直到一次再次地派遣飞机侵入苏联，进行直接挑衅。赫鲁晓夫同志说，“苏联人民和苏联政府过去和现在一向对美国表示和平和友好。但是我们却得到了卑鄙的忘恩负义的报答”。
    既然美帝国主义的侵略活动越来越疯狂，那末，全世界一切爱好和平的人民，为了维护世界和平，就必须百倍地提高警惕。美帝国主义的最终目的，是称霸全世界，奴役各国人民。为达此目的，美帝国主义必然要镇压世界各国民族民主运动和一切进步的和平的力量，必然要到处扩张自己的侵略势力，必然要把保卫世界和平的强大堡垒——以苏联为首的社会主义阵营看作是眼中钉。为了实现这个目的，美帝国主义就推行“实力地位政策”、“战争边缘政策”，以至公开发动侵略战争。当它的战争政策受到阻碍的时候，它就佯言“和平演变”、“和平致胜”，以便争取时间，加快扩军备战的速度。因此，全世界人民既不要在美帝国主义的武力威胁和武力进攻面前惊慌失措和悲观失望，也不要因为它的花言巧语而抱有幻想和松懈斗志。
    马克思列宁主义认为，侵略和战争就是帝国主义的本性。认清这个颠扑不破的、永不会过时的真理，在今天对于保卫世界和平的斗争具有特别重大的现实意义。为了和缓国际紧张局势，为了维护世界和平，全世界一切爱好和平的人民，对于以美国为首的帝国主义集团的一切侵略活动、扩军备战活动以及和平阴谋，必须加强揭露，加强斗争。世界和平是关系各国人民切身利益的当前最主要的国际问题。苏联、中国和所有社会主义国家一贯奉行和平外交政策，努力维护世界和平。现在由于全世界维护和平的力量首先是社会主义阵营力量空前强大，制止世界大战的可能性是存在的。正如赫鲁晓夫同志所指出的，“我们希望和平。但是我们致力于和平并不意味着乞求和平。”须知帝国主义是从来不愿意和平共处的，他们总是不放过一切机会进行扩张和侵略，不放过一切机会欺侮和威胁各国人民。美国飞机对苏联的挑衅，不就是一个最新鲜的证明吗？除非忍受欺凌，听任帝国主义横行霸道，否则就必须对帝国主义的侵略阴谋进行揭露和反击。对帝国主义的侵略活动和扩军准备活动揭露得越彻底，斗争得越坚决，使帝国主义越陷于孤立，实现和缓国际紧张局势和维护世界和平的任务就越有保证。相反的，如果回避斗争，那只能助长帝国主义的气焰，使它的侵略活动更加嚣张。如果替帝国主义隐恶，那只能麻痹各国人民，使帝国主义发动战争的危险增加，使各国人民受害。现在美帝国主义的侵略战争阴谋所以越来越难以得逞，正是因为世界各国越来越多的人逐渐看穿了美帝国主义的侵略本性，并且日益坚决地同它进行斗争。
    我们指出帝国主义的侵略本性和美帝国主义在全世界带头扩军备战，这丝毫不是说，美帝国主义的侵略计划和战争计划将要得逞，我们对于维护和平的立场和信念将要发生动摇。相反，我们坚定地深信，各国人民反对美帝国主义、反对侵略政策和战争政策，维护世界和平的斗争前途是无限光明的。这首先是因为存在着强大的社会主义阵营，因为以苏联为首的社会主义各国的团结是牢不可破的，因为社会主义各国同世界被压迫民族、被剥削人民和一切爱好和平的人民是团结一致的。帝国主义者及其走狗千方百计地企图破坏社会主义各国的团结和社会主义国家同亚、非、拉丁美洲各国人民的团结，他们的卑鄙无耻的伎俩是不会达到目的的。中国人民同其他兄弟国家的人民坚决地站在一起，时刻警惕着美帝国主义的侵略阴谋，并随时准备给以坚决的回击。我们不止一次地宣告过：我们热爱世界和平，但是我们不怕战争。美帝国主义如果以为我们可欺，胆敢侵犯社会主义国家，它一定要碰得头破血流。今天正是战胜希特勒德国十五周年纪念日，美帝国主义如果竟然走上希特勒发动侵略战争的老路，那末它的结局只会比希特勒失败得更加悲惨。我们坚信：以苏联为首的伟大的社会主义阵营，同各国工人运动、民族独立运动、和平运动以及一切爱好和平的力量在一起，一定能够粉碎以美国为首的帝国主义集团的侵略计划和战争计划，一定能够维护世界和平。
