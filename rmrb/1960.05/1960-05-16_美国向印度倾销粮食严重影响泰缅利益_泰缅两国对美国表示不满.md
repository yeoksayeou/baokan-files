Xinhua News Agency, 14th: The United States' practice of selling 17 million tons of "surplus" grain to India through its recent agreement with India has aroused dissatisfaction from Thailand and Burma, Asian rice-producing countries.

Thai Prime Minister Sarit Thanarat told reporters on the 12th that this practice by the United States would greatly affect Thailand's foreign rice trade.

Sarit complained that the United States had long known that rice was Thailand's main export commodity. He said there was no reason for the United States to dump large quantities of surplus grain in Asia to compete with Thailand's market.

Sarit also revealed that the Thai cabinet held a meeting that day to discuss the matter, and the ministers present expressed dissatisfaction with the US practice.

On the 11th, Thai Foreign Minister Thanat Khoman also told reporters that the US practice had seriously affected Thailand's rice export plan. This would reduce Thailand's income by 200 million baht.

He also said that since learning of the news, "I can't sleep or eat, and I want to resign."

India is an important customer of Thai rice, and it used to purchase more than 300,000 tons of rice from Thailand every year.

Thanat told reporters again on the afternoon of the 11th that since the United States dumped rice in Asia, it has seriously hit Thailand's agricultural production. Domestic grain prices have plummeted from about 800 baht per cart (equivalent to 2,000 liters) to 350 baht per cart, affecting 15 million Thai farmers.

Thai Interior Minister Praphat Charusathien said on the same day that he "expressed deep regret" over the US practice.

The Burmese "Nation" newspaper published an editorial on the 11th entitled "Rice Traded for Politics," stating that the US agreement to sell 17 million tons of "surplus" grain to India included "political reasons."

The newspaper said, "India has been starving for many years, but the United States believes that only now has the appropriate political climate emerged in that country (India) to give such a gift."

Referring to the impact of the agreement on the Burmese rice market, the newspaper complained, "Ever since American grain first broke into our traditional market, our buyers have been haggling with us." The newspaper said, "At present, we will find that we are producing more rice but getting less foreign exchange."

    美国向印度倾销粮食严重影响泰缅利益
    泰缅两国对美国表示不满
    新华社14日讯　美国通过它最近同印度签订的协定向印度出售一千七百万吨“剩余”粮食的做法，引起了亚洲产米国家泰国和缅甸的不满。
    泰国总理乃沙立12日向报界发表谈话说，美国这个做法将大大地影响到泰国的大米对外贸易。
    乃沙立抱怨说，美国早已知道，大米是泰国主要的出口货物，他说，美国在亚洲倾销大量剩余粮食来同泰国竞争市场是没有理由的。
    乃沙立还透露，泰国内阁当天举行会议讨论了这件事，到会部长都对美国的这种做法表示不满。
    11日，泰国外交部长乃他纳·科曼也对报界发表谈话说，美国的这种做法已严重地影响到泰国大米的输出计划。这将使泰国减少收入二亿铢。
    他又说，自从知道这个消息以后，“我睡也睡不着，吃也吃不下，我想辞职”。
    印度是泰国大米的重要主顾，它过去曾经每年向泰国购入大米三十余万吨。
    乃他纳在11日下午再次向报界发表讲话说，自从美国向亚洲倾销大米以后，已严重地打击了泰国的农业生产，国内谷价大跌，由每车
  （合二千公升）约值八百铢跌为每车三百五十铢，泰国一千五百万农民将受到影响。
    泰国内政部长乃巴博·乍鲁沙天同一天说，他对美国的这个做法“表示深切的遗憾”。
    缅甸“民族报”11日以“以大米交换政治”为题发表社论说，美国向印度出售一千七百万吨“剩余”粮食的协定包括了“政治上的原因。”
    这家报纸说，“印度已经挨了许多年的饥饿，但是美国认为只有现在，那个国家（印度）才算出现了赠送这种礼物的适当政治气候。”
    在谈到这项协定对缅甸大米市场所产生的影响的时候，这家报纸抱怨说，“自从美国的谷物第一次打破我们传统的市场以来，我们的买主就一直在同我们大讲价钱。”这家报纸说，“在目前，我们会发现我们自己生产的大米更多而得到的外汇却更少。”
