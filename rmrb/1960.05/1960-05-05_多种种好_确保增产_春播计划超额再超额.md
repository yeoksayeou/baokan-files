Plant More and Plant Well to Ensure Increased Production
Spring Planting Plan Exceeded Again and Again
Vigorously Reclaim Land and Develop Planting Industry

Inner Mongolia
Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 4th: In Inner Mongolia's pastoral areas, large-scale land reclamation is underway to plant food and fodder crops, opening the way for simultaneous development of animal husbandry and planting industries.

From the Hulunbuir grasslands in the east to the Ordos Plateau in the west, there are more than ninety reclamation areas and land reclamation points in state-owned agricultural and pastoral farms this year. They have mobilized two to three thousand people, driving tractors and horse-drawn farm implements, reclaiming land while spring planting. One hundred and sixty pastoral people's communes distributed across the major grasslands have mobilized thirty to forty thousand people to march on the wasteland.

The large-scale production movement of land reclamation and crop cultivation in Inner Mongolia's pastoral areas is the result of the Party's policy of simultaneously developing planting and animal husbandry taking deep root in people's hearts.

Million Mu Per Day Sowing While Fighting Drought
Shanxi
Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 4th: The spring sowing high tide in Shanxi Province is advancing from south to north. Currently, the province has sown over 17 million mu of late-autumn crops, with a daily sowing progress of one million mu. The sowing period is generally five to fifteen days earlier than in previous years, and the sowing quality is unprecedentedly good.

This year's spring sowing work in Shanxi Province is being carried out in the struggle against severe drought. The province has been very dry since last winter, but through the efforts of the broad masses of commune members, the province's spring irrigation area has still reached over 11 million mu, an increase of more than two times over the same period last year. Currently, the drought situation is still developing. In order to complete the spring sowing task in a timely manner, the province has transferred another one million commune members to carry out crash repairs of water conservancy projects and actively carry out spring irrigation work.

Rice Transplanters Show Great Power in Jiangxi
Jiangxi
Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 4th: The first batch of 100,000 rice transplanters promoted in various parts of Jiangxi have shown great power in early rice transplanting.

Currently, more than 200,000 male and female commune members across the province have become rice transplanter operators. According to calculations by relevant departments, 60% of the early rice in the province this year will be machine-transplanted, saving more than five million labor days compared to manual transplanting. Machine transplanting is uniform, neat, and consistent in depth, surpassing the quality of manual transplanting.

Many rice transplanter operators and specialized teams are constantly improving and enhancing their operating techniques, continuously creating new rice transplanting records. Rao Fulin, the youth shock brigade leader of the Red Star Brigade of the Wanfang Commune in Nancheng County, created a rice transplanting record of an average of 13.5 mu per day, and the transplanted fields did not leak seedlings, had no missing hills, and the plants were even and the rows were straight.

The tremendous power of rice transplanters has attracted every commune member. Now, various places are stepping up the manufacture of rice transplanters, planning to use rice transplanters for all late rice transplanting this year.

Inspect Spring Sowing Quality
Gansu
Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 4th: In the struggle against drought, various parts of Gansu Province have overfulfilled the summer field sowing plan and immediately launched a large-scale spring sowing quality inspection movement.

Statistics as of April 25 showed that the actual sowing area of ​​summer fields in the province has reached more than 15.96 million mu, exceeding the sowing plan. The sowing speed of autumn fields is also twice as fast as the same period last year. According to inspections in Dingxi, Tianshui, Linxia, ​​Zhangye and other places, among the 9.3 million mu of summer field crops that have been sown, first-class seedlings account for 60.5%, second-class seedlings account for 28%, and third-class seedlings account for 11.5%. All parts of the province are full of confidence and soaring enthusiasm for this year's bumper harvest, and have put forward the slogan of "secretaries taking the lead, the whole people taking action, and eliminating third-class fields." For land that has not yet been sown, they are rushing to seize moisture for planting; for land that has already been sown, they are inspecting and supplementing to ensure complete, uniform, and strong seedlings.

Save Seedlings and Transplant Early Rice Well
Shanghai
Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 4th: Early rice transplanting has fully begun in the suburbs of Shanghai. While adhering to specifications and quality, all counties are vigorously saving seedlings and doing everything possible to ensure the completion of the early rice planting plan.

This spring, Shanghai's suburbs experienced continuous low temperatures and rainy weather, and the seedlings did not grow quickly. In some areas, there were seedling rot and lodging, so there was a feeling that there were insufficient seedlings. How to improve the utilization rate of seedlings has become the key to transplanting early rice well. At the beginning of rice transplanting, many people's communes publicized the great significance of saving seedlings to commune members. Party secretaries of communes and production teams also went deep into the fields to study ways to save seedlings and transplant rice well with commune members, ensuring both reasonable close planting and saving seedlings.

Overcome Rain and Rush to Transplant Early Rice
Hunan
Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 4th: From the foot of the Five Ridges Mountains to the shores of Dongting Lake, the vast fields are filled with voices and red flags are flying - 15 million labor troops in Hunan Province are fighting against the adverse conditions brought about by rain and cold waves, rushing to transplant early rice. By the end of April, the province had transplanted more than 18.4 million mu of early rice. The Liuzhou Special Zone, where the season is earlier, has basically completed transplanting.

In previous years, after early rice was transplanted, it took five to seven days for the seedlings to survive and turn green. This year, in order to regain the season, various places have widely mobilized the masses to take measures such as applying more quick-acting fertilizers, transplanting tender and strong seedlings, improving transplanting techniques, transplanting based on the weather, and shallow irrigation after transplanting, striving to shorten and eliminate the greening period of early rice seedlings, ensure the early maturity and bumper harvest of early rice, and transplant late rice in a timely manner.

Finish Transplanting Early Rice Before and After the Start of Summer
Anhui
Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 4th: People's communes in Anhui's rice-producing areas strive to complete the early rice transplanting work with quality and quantity before and after the Start of Summer.

Now, in the rice-producing areas north and south of the Yangtze River in the province, superior labor forces are concentrated on rushing to transplant early rice. The Wuhu Special Zone has invested nearly one million laborers in transplanting rice, including more than 20,000 rice transplanting specialized teams formed by various people's communes; there are 300,000 cadres, students, and urban residents who have come to support the rush transplanting. The rice transplanting progress in the entire special zone is unstoppable. All localities have adhered to high quality in rushing to transplant. Each commune in Qingyang County, Anqing Special Zone, implements a one-day acceptance, a three-day inspection, and a five-day evaluation of the rice transplanting work. By April 26, the more than 60,000 mu of early rice that had been transplanted in the county had generally reached the originally planned quality requirements.

Vigorously Grasp the Work of Mid-season Rice Seedling Cultivation
Hubei
Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan: Various parts of Hubei Province are vigorously grasping the work of sowing and cultivating mid-season rice seedlings.

The rice area in Hubei Province accounts for about half of the province's cultivated land area, and the mid-season rice area is large and the yield is high, which has always accounted for a large proportion of the province's grain output. In order to strive for a bumper harvest of mid-season rice this year, specific measures related to mid-season rice sowing and seedling cultivation have been formulated from the county to the production team. Various places have also launched a vigorous fertilizer accumulation movement, with about 3 million people going to the mountains and lakes every day to accumulate fertilizer.

Transform Low-Yielding Fields for High Yields and Bumper Harvests
Guizhou
Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 4th: 80% of the low-yielding fields in Guizhou Province have changed their original appearance, laying a solid foundation for the comprehensive high yield of crops this year. From last winter to the end of March this year, the province focused on improving more than 5.85 million mu of low-yielding fields, which is equal to two-thirds of the soil improvement area in the past ten years.

Among the more than 30 million mu of cultivated land in Guizhou Province, about two-thirds are low-yielding fields with undesirable properties such as barren, thin, sticky, sandy, cold, acidic, rusty, and rotten. Therefore, all parts of the province have listed soil improvement as an important measure to seize agricultural bumper harvests. Tongren County, which has done the best in soil improvement work, organized a specialized team of more than 80,000 people this spring to carry out a crash transformation of more than 160,000 mu of low-yielding fields, and more than 220,000 mu of steep slope thin soil were transformed into terraced fields and terraced soil.

    多种种好　确保增产
    春播计划超额再超额
    大力开荒发展种植业
    内蒙古
    据新华社呼和浩特4日电　内蒙古牧区大规模地开荒，种植粮食和饲料作物，为畜牧业和种植业同时大发展开辟道路。
    东起呼伦贝尔草原，西到鄂尔多斯高原，今年各国营农牧场的垦区和开荒点就有九十多个。他们共出动了两三万人，驾着拖拉机和马拉农具，一边开荒，一边春播。分布在各大草原上的一百六十个牧区人民公社，共出动了三、四万人向荒地进军。
    内蒙古牧区声势浩大的开荒种植农作物的生产运动，是党的种植业与畜牧业同时并举的方针深入人心的结果。
    抗旱播种日达百万亩
    山西
    据新华社太原4日电　山西省的春播高潮，正由南而北向前推进。目前，全省已播种大秋作物一千七百多万亩，播种日进度达到一百万亩，播种期一般比往年提前五天到十五天，播种质量空前良好。
    山西省今年的春播工作，是在同严重的干旱作斗争中进行的。全省从去冬以来一直很旱，但经过广大社员的努力，全省春浇面积仍然达到一千一百多万亩，比去年同期增加了两倍多。目前，各地旱象仍在继续发展，为了适时完成春播任务，全省又抽调了一百万名社员突击兴修水利和积极开展春浇工作。
    插秧机大显威风江　西
    据新华社南昌4日电　江西各地推广的第一批十万部插秧机，在早稻插秧中大显威风。
    目前，全省已有二十多万男女社员成为插秧机手。据有关部门计算，今年全省将有60％的早稻使用机插，比手插能节约劳动日五百多万个。机插均匀、整齐、深浅一致，赛过手插质量。
    许多插秧机手和专业队不断改进和提高操作技术，不断创造出插秧新纪录。南城县万坊公社红星大队青年突击队长饶福林，创造了平均日插十三亩半的插秧纪录，而且所插的田不漏秧，无掉兜，株匀、行直。
    插秧机的巨大威力吸引了每个社员，现在各地都在加紧制造插秧机，计划今年晚稻插秧全部使用插秧机。
    检查春播质量
    甘肃
    据新华社兰州4日电　甘肃省各地在与干旱作斗争中，超额完成夏田播种计划，随即展开了春播质量大检查运动。
    截止4月25日统计，全省夏田实播面积已达一千五百九十六万多亩，超额完成了播种计划。秋田播种速度也比去年同期快一倍。据定西、天水、临夏、张掖等地检查，已播的九百三十万亩夏田作物中，一类苗占60.5％，二类苗占28％，三类苗占11.5％。各地对今年大丰收信心十足，干劲冲天，提出了书记挂帅，全民动手，消灭三类田的口号。对还没有播种的地，正在赶快抢墒下种；已经播种的，就边查边补，保证苗全、苗齐、苗壮。
    节约秧苗　插好早稻
    上海
    据新华社上海4日电　上海郊区早稻插秧全面开始。各县在坚持规格和质量的同时，大力节约秧苗，千方百计保证完成早稻的种植计划。
    今年春天，上海郊区连续低温阴雨，秧苗生长不快，有些地区发生烂秧、倒秧现象，因而感到秧苗不足。如何提高秧苗的利用率，就成为栽好早稻的关键。许多人民公社插秧一开始，就向社员群众宣传了节约秧苗的巨大意义。公社、生产队党的书记也深入田间，同社员一起研究节约秧苗，插好秧的办法，保证做到既合理密植，又能节约秧苗。
    战胜阴雨　抢插早稻
    湖南
    据新华社长沙4日电　从五岭山麓到洞庭湖滨，广阔的田野上人声鼎沸，红旗飘扬——湖南省一千五百万劳动大军正同阴雨寒潮带来的不利条件搏斗，抢插早稻。到4月下旬止，全省已插早稻一千八百四十多万亩。季节较早的柳州专区已经基本插完。
    往年早稻插下去以后，秧苗要五天到七天才能成活转青。今年为了夺回季节，各地都广泛发动群众，采取多施速效肥料、插嫩壮秧、改进插秧技术、看天气插秧和插后浅灌水等措施，力争缩短和消灭早稻秧苗的回青期，保证早稻早熟丰收，及时插下晚稻。
    立夏前后插完早稻
    安徽
    据新华社合肥4日电　安徽水稻产区各人民公社力争在立夏前后按质按量完成早稻插秧工作。
    现在，全省大江南北的水稻产区，集中了优势劳力突击抢栽早稻。芜湖专区投入插秧的劳力近一百万人，其中有各人民公社组成的两万多个栽秧专业队；有前来支援抢插的三十万机关干部、学生和城镇居民，全专区栽秧进度势如破竹。各地在抢栽中都坚持了高质量。安庆专区青阳县各公社，对插秧工作，实行一天一验收，三天一检查，五天一评比，到4月26日止，全县已插的六万多亩早稻，普遍达到了原订的质量要求。
    大抓中稻育秧工作
    湖北
    据新华社武汉电　湖北省各地大抓中稻播种、育秧工作。
    湖北省水稻面积约占全省耕地面积一半左右，而其中又以中稻面积大，产量高，历来在全省粮食产量中占很大比重。为了争取今年中稻大丰收，从县到生产队都及早地制定了有关中稻播种、育秧的具体措施，各地又掀起一个声势浩大的积肥运动，每天约有三百多万人上山下湖，突击积肥。
    改造低产田高产丰收
    贵州
    据新华社贵阳4日电　贵州省80％的低产田已经改变原来的面貌，为今年农作物全面高产奠定了稳固基础。从去冬到今年3月底，全省重点改良低产田五百八十五万多亩，等于过去十年改良土壤面积的三分之二。
    贵州省三千多万亩耕地中，约有三分之二是属于瘦、薄、粘、沙冷、酸、锈、烂等不良性质的低产田。因此，全省各地都把改良土壤列为夺取农业丰收的重要措施之一。土壤改良工作最出色的铜仁县，今春，全县组织八万多人的专业队，突击改造了低产田土十六万多亩，还有二十二万多亩陡坡薄土被改成梯田梯土。（附图片）
