Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 28th: Guangdong Province is actively deploying flood and flood prevention work, preparing to meet and overcome possible floods at any time, and ensuring a bumper harvest in agricultural production.

　　As early as April, when the rainy season began, the provincial flood control headquarters and the flood control organizations of various regions and counties resumed operations one after another. They were led by the party committee secretary to strengthen leadership, convened flood control work meetings, rectified, restored and established various professional flood fighting and rescue teams, stored equipment, and conducted rescue exercises.

　　All regions regard reservoir flood control as the key to this year's flood control work. All key reservoir projects have strengthened flood control preparations based on different circumstances. Large and medium-sized reservoirs that have been built have established special flood control organizations.

　　Recently, counties along the river and coast in the province have actively organized forces to carefully inspect hidden dangers in the dike before the flood season arrives and carry out heightening and reinforcement work. Dongguan County, located at the mouth of the Dongjiang River, recently concentrated tens of thousands of laborers to heighten and thicken the main dikes such as Dongguan Dawei, Guayingzhouwei, Fuyanzhouwei, and Jingxi'aowei. Along the Beijiang Dam, which protects nearly one million mu of farmland in Guangzhou and its northwestern suburbs, cone exploration teams are checking the hidden dangers of the dam section day and night, tracing and repairing or grouting. Gaohe County, which has a relatively weak flood control history, has done a good job in preparing for flood control this year and has basically completed the earthwork for the emergency repair of the dangerous sections of the four county-wide dikes.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 28th: Zhejiang Province is actively preparing for flood control to ensure the safe passage of large and small water conservancy projects through the flood season.

　　The Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently issued instructions to conduct surprise inspections, reinforce, and rush to repair water conservancy projects. At present, all regions are organizing forces to comprehensively inspect, accept, and appraise various water conservancy projects; at the same time, they are concentrating manpower, material resources, and tools to rush to reinforce and heighten water conservancy projects. More than 140 secretaries at the three levels of Yongkang County led commune members in a surprise attack for eight days, clearing all the finishing projects and basically completing the project supporting facilities, so that the project can safely pass the flood season and maximize its benefits.

　　In mountainous and hilly areas, while doing a good job in flood control projects, they also build many reservoir groups based on the completion of a large number of reservoir projects and the development of cascade projects, and adopt the method of joint management within a small watershed based on key projects to achieve unified storage and irrigation and mutual adjustment; prevent the danger of continuous breakthroughs in downstream projects if a project in the upstream has problems. In plain areas prone to waterlogging, in addition to actively completing the three supporting facilities of engineering, organization, and machinery, they also pre-lower the water level to achieve drainage before waterlogging. In river embankment and sea dike areas, vigorously repair dangerous sections and eliminate hidden dangers.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 28th: While vigorously fighting drought, all parts of Shandong Province are doing everything possible to strengthen the flood control front. In recent days, various regions and cities have transferred elite troops and generals, led by commanders, to conduct major inspections, major repairs, major acceptance, and major promotions of the Yellow River, inland rivers, reservoirs, and field drainage projects. In the spirit of "seizing time, preparing early, and striving for initiative," the Linyi area has organized a flood control team to help rush to repair reservoir construction sites where completion before the flood season is difficult. The Jining area, which planned early and acted early, has carried out comprehensive inspections of all reservoir projects. More than 90,000 people in the Changwei area are actively reinforcing embankments and rushing to repair reservoirs, striving to safely pass the flood season.

　　In order to achieve a guaranteed harvest in both drought and flood, the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out: Judging from the historical natural development law, floods and droughts often occur alternately. Therefore, in June, July, and August, we must not only focus on flood control, but also be prepared to fight drought at all times. It is required that leaders at all levels must not only establish the idea of long-term drought resistance, but also closely integrate flood control and drought resistance, take both into account, and make unified arrangements. We must use the good period of the rainy season to vigorously engage in flood interception and water storage, store and use water simultaneously, store water for future use, and turn harmful water into beneficial water, so as to be able to prevent both waterlogging and drought.

    广东浙江山东抓紧防汛
    据新华社广州28日电　广东省积极部署防洪防汛工作，准备随时迎击和战胜可能发生的洪水，确保农业生产大丰收。
    早在4月间雨季开始来临的时候，省防汛总指挥部和各专区、县的防汛指挥机构便先后恢复办公，并由党委书记挂帅，加强领导，分别召开了防汛工作会议，整顿、恢复和建立各种防汛抢险的专业队伍，储备了器材，进行了抢险演习。
    各地都把水库防汛作为今年防汛工作的重点。各重点水库工程，都已分别根据不同情况，加强了防汛准备工作，已建成的各地大中型水库都在建立专门防汛组织。
    省内沿江、沿海各县，最近都积极组织力量，在大汛期未到之前，认真检查锥探堤围的隐患，进行加高加固工作。位于东江出海处的东莞县，最近集中了上万民工给东莞大围、挂影洲围、福燕洲围和京西鳌围等主要堤围，加高培厚。保卫着广州市及其西北郊近百万亩农田的北江大堤沿线，锥探队正在日日夜夜检查堤段的险患，追根翻修或灌浆。历年防汛工作比较薄弱的高鹤县，今年的防汛准备工作做得很好，已基本完成县内四条全县性大堤围险段的抢修土方。
    据新华社杭州28日电　浙江省各地积极准备防汛工作，确保大小水利工程安渡汛期。
    中共浙江省委最近发出突击检查、加固赶修水利工程的指示。目前，各地正在组织力量，全面对各水利工程进行检查验收和鉴定；同时，集中人力、物力和工具，突击水利工程加固、加高工作。永康县全县三级书记一百四十多人带领社员突击八天，全部扫清收尾工程，并基本上完成了工程配套，使工程安渡汛期，并且发挥最大效益。
    山区、丘陵地区在做好防汛工程中，还根据大批水库工程的建成，以及梯级工程的开发，建成许多水库群，并采取以骨干工程为基础，在一个小流域范围内联合管理的办法，达到蓄、灌统一，互相调剂；防止上游一处工程出险，下游工程连续突破的危险。平原易涝地区根据渠网化的发展，除了积极完成工程、组织、机具三配套外，并且预降水位，做到未涝先排。江堤、海塘地区，大力抢修险工地段，彻底消灭隐患。
    据新华社济南28日电　山东省各地在大力抗旱斗争的同时，正在千方百计加强防汛战线。连日来，各个专区和市调集精兵骁将，由指挥员率领，开始对黄河、内河、水库和田间排涝工程，进行大检查、大整修、大验收、大促进。临沂专区本着“抢时间，早准备，争主动”的精神，已组织一支防汛队伍，到汛前完工有困难的水库工地帮助抢修。计划早、行动早的济宁专区，已对所有水库工程进行了全面检查。昌潍专区有九万多人在积极加固堤防，抢修水库，争取安全渡过汛期。
    为了做到旱涝保丰收，中共山东省委指出：从历史自然发展规律来看，水旱灾害常是交替发生，所以，6、7、8月份既要突出抓好防汛，又要时刻准备抗旱。要求各级领导既要树立长期抗旱思想，又要防汛抗旱密切结合，互相兼顾，统一安排。要利用雨季良好时期，大搞拦洪蓄水、边蓄、边用，蓄存备用，变害水为利水，做到既能防涝又能防旱。
