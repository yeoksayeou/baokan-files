    Xinhua News Agency report: In recent days, factories, enterprises, government offices, and schools throughout the Soviet Union have held mass rallies. According to incomplete statistics, in Moscow alone, more than 5,600 rallies were held on the 17th, with more than 1.2 million people participating. Speakers at the meetings unanimously expressed their support for Khrushchev's statement in Paris on the 16th and strongly condemned the U.S. ruling clique's despicable actions of adhering to its policy of aggression and sabotaging the Four-Power Summit Conference.
    At a meeting held at the Vladimir Ilyich Factory in Moscow with more than 3,000 workers participating, driller Pogorelov said, "We fully support the position taken by the head of the Soviet government, and we are extremely indignant at the American imperialists who have adopted a hostile policy towards the Soviet Union and the socialist camp."
    A meeting was held in Sverdlovsk with more than 1,000 representatives from all walks of life. Zamiry, the First Secretary of the Sverdlovsk City Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, said, "The threats of the American warmongers cannot frighten us. If the U.S. government is stubborn and continues to pursue its policy of sending spies to our country, then serious consequences await them."
    The Soviet Academy of Sciences also held a meeting of scientists. The President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Semyanov, said that Soviet scientists, like all Soviet people, expressed unparalleled anger at the provocative actions of the United States, and they expressed their firm determination to contribute their strength to the cause of defending the motherland.
    Officers and soldiers of various combat units of the Soviet armed forces also held meetings to support Khrushchev's statement. Novichkov, an officer of a unit in the Far East Military District, said at the meeting, "We cannot negotiate at all with the head of a country that takes perfidy and banditry as its policy. For all of us soldiers, the conclusion is very clear: we must be better prepared for combat." (For detailed report, see page 2)

    Xinhua News Agency report: Workers, peasants, teachers, students, and people from all walks of life in Beijing, Shanghai, Hebei Province, and Tianjin have successively issued statements and held rallies, resolutely supporting the statement of Chairman Khrushchev of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and strongly condemning the U.S. imperialism's banditry of adhering to a policy of aggression and undermining the Four-Power Summit Conference.
    In Beijing, workers from the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant and the No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, the crew members of the Beijing-Ulan Bator-Moscow joint transport train, members of the Shijingshan Sino-Soviet Friendship People's Commune, and students from the Institute of International Relations and Renmin University of China all expressed their will. Wang Cai, the head of the No. 2 blast furnace of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company's Ironmaking Plant, said that the Chinese people have long seen through that Eisenhower is not a "messenger of peace" but the world's biggest and most ferocious enemy. We Chinese workers are determined to unite closely with the Soviet people, completely smash all provocative acts of U.S. imperialism, and fight to the end to defend world peace.
    In Shanghai, after seeing the report on Comrade Khrushchev's statement condemning the United States for adhering to its policy of aggression, the workers of the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant unanimously expressed their full support, believing that the statement powerfully exposed the aggressive policy of U.S. imperialism. The Lu Shengzhi group of the No. 2 open-hearth furnace in the steel casting workshop also passed a resolution, resolutely condemning the provocative act of U.S. imperialism's aircraft intruding into Soviet airspace. They believe that on the eve of the Four-Power Summit Conference, the United States sent aircraft to the Soviet Union to conduct espionage activities, deliberately undermining the Four-Power Summit Conference. The United States is entirely responsible for the failure of the conference.
    When Comrade Khrushchev's statement reached Fudan University and Jiaotong University, the students all clapped their hands in approval and unanimously supported the solemn position of the Soviet government. In the past two days, many classes have held rallies. Chen Tinglai, chairman of the student union of Jiaotong University, said at the meeting: Comrade Khrushchev's statement is a powerful blow to U.S. imperialism, and all the students of our Jiaotong University resolutely support the just position of the Soviet government.
    People from all walks of life in Hebei Province and Tianjin held rallies on the evening of the 18th. When people from all walks of life spoke at the meeting, they unanimously stated: resolutely support the statement made by Chairman Khrushchev of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union at the preparatory meeting of the Four-Power Summit Conference. They pointed out that Eisenhower's sophistry regarding the condemnation of the Soviet Union once again clearly exposed the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism. At the same time, they repeatedly stated: the people of Hebei Province are determined to fight to the end with the Soviet working brothers and the Soviet people against U.S. imperialism and to defend world peace.

    苏联各战斗部队的官兵也都举行了支持赫鲁晓夫声明的集会。远东军区某部队军官诺维奇科夫在会上说，“我们根本不能同把背信弃义和进行强盗活动作为政策的国家的首脑进行谈判。对我们所有军人来说，结论非常清楚：要更加作好战斗准备。”（详细报道见第二版）
