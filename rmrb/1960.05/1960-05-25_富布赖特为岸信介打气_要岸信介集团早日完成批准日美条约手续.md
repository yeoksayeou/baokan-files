Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 24th -- U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Fulbright stated on the 23rd that the United States is impatiently urging the Kishi Nobusuke group to swiftly complete all procedures for approving the new U.S.-Japan military treaty. He said that he intends to submit the treaty to the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee for discussion after Japan has "officially and completely completed the approval" procedures for the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

He encouraged Kishi Nobusuke by saying that the U.S. Congress will approve the treaty. He also feigned ignorance, saying that he "doesn't hear much opposition to this treaty, at least in this country (referring to the United States)."

    要岸信介集团早日完成批准日美条约手续
    新华社24日讯　华盛顿消息：美国参议院外交委员会主席富布赖特23日表示，美国在迫不及待督促岸信介集团迅速全部完成批准新日美军事条约手续。他说，他打算在日本“正式全部完成批准”日美“安全条约”的手续后就把这个条约提交美国参议院外交委员会讨论。
    他为岸信介打气说，美国国会将会批准这个条约的，他还装聋卖傻地说，他“听不到对这个条约有很多反对意见，至少在这个国家（指美国）是如此”。
