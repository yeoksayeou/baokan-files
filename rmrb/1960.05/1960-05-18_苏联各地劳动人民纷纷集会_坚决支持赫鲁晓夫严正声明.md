The laboring people in various parts of the Soviet Union gathered to firmly support Khrushchev's solemn statement.

    (Dispatch) Khrushchev's statement at the preparatory meeting of the Paris Four-Power Summit has received widespread support from the Soviet people. In Moscow, Leningrad, Stalingrad, Kiev, Tbilisi, Stavropol, and other places, mass rallies were held, unanimously supporting Khrushchev's solemn statement, expressing that the Soviet people would resolutely not tolerate the provocative policies of American imperialism.
    The working people expressed their views at the rallies, saying that the actions of the American leaders proved that they did not want peace, and the provocative policies of American imperialism had ruined the Four-Power Summit. The Soviet government cannot negotiate with a government that openly supports provocative actions. Workers at the famous Kirov Factory of the Leningrad?瓦 Machine Manufacturing Plant unanimously supported Khrushchev's statement at the rally, and firmly stated that the workers of Leningrad, like all Soviet workers, must unite more closely and strengthen the power of the motherland with selfless labor in order to powerfully strike at invading enemies. Tseresov, a welder participating in the construction of the Kuibyshev Hydropower Station project, warned the gentlemen across the ocean: You cannot scare the Soviet people who defeated Hitler! If anyone dares to invade our motherland, they will suffer the same fate as Hitler.
    Officers and soldiers of the Soviet combat troops have also expressed their support for Khrushchev's statement. Captain Kurkin of a certain unit in the Moscow Military District said, let the head of the Soviet government's statement sober up the feverish heads of the aggressors! We are always ready to teach those who carry out military provocations a lesson!

    苏联各地劳动人民纷纷集会
    坚决支持赫鲁晓夫严正声明
    本报讯　赫鲁晓夫在巴黎四国首脑会议预备会议上的声明得到了苏联人民的广泛拥护。莫斯科、列宁格勒、斯大林格勒、基辅、第比利斯、斯塔伏罗波尔等地人民纷纷举行群众大会，一致支持赫鲁晓夫的严正声明，表示苏联人民坚决不能容忍美帝国主义的挑衅政策。
    劳动人民在集会上发表意见说：美国领导人的行动证明它们不希望和平，美帝国主义的挑衅政策破坏了四国首脑会议，苏联政府不能同明目张胆支持挑衅行动的政府谈判。著名的列宁格勒?瓦机器制造厂基洛夫工厂的工人在集会上一致支持赫鲁晓夫的声明，并坚决表示列宁格勒的工人像苏联所有工人一样，一定要更紧密地团结起来，用忘我的劳动加强祖国的威力，以便有力地打击来犯的敌人。参加建设古比雪夫水电站工程的电焊工茨列索夫警告大洋彼岸的先生们说：你们吓不倒曾打垮过希特勒的苏联人民！如果谁敢侵犯我们的祖国，也将得到与希特勒同样的下场。
    苏联各战斗部队的官兵也纷纷表示支持赫鲁晓夫的声明。莫斯科军区某部队上尉库尔金说，让苏联政府首脑的声明清醒一下侵略者发热的头脑吧！我们随时准备教训那些进行军事挑衅的人！
