    Supporting the Struggle of Japanese Miike Miners
    Nanjing Three Thousand Coal Miners Rally
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, May 25th: People from all walks of life in Nanjing continue to hold various activities to support the Japanese people's struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty.
    The Jiangsu Provincial and Nanjing Municipal Committees of the CPPCC held a rally on the 21st. Leading members of democratic parties and non-party democrats in the province and city strongly condemned the U.S. imperialists for directing the Nobusuke Kishi reactionary group to use force to coerce the Japanese House of Representatives to "pass" the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty.
    Ren Chonggao, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang (RCCK), said that U.S. imperialism's sabotage of the Four-Power Summit Conference and its instigation of its lackey, the Nobusuke Kishi reactionary group, to brazenly use police violence to force the Japanese House of Representatives to pass the aggressive Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, once again proves that U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the people of the world. This will only further arouse the public anger of the Japanese people and the people of the world, and accelerate the demise of U.S. imperialism. Chen Zhongfan, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, said that the Chinese people resolutely support the Japanese people's just struggle against U.S. imperialism and to overthrow the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, until the Japanese people achieve final victory.
    More than three thousand coal miners in Nanjing held a rally on the afternoon of the 21st to support the just struggle of the Japanese Miike coal miners. At the meeting, they expressed their heartfelt respect and full support to the Miike coal miners who have persisted in their strike for eight months against the dismissal of workers by the Zaibatsu and the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. Chen Ruhua, a representative of the Guantang Coal Mine workers, said: The struggle of the Miike coal miners is by no means isolated. The powerful Chinese working class is their reliable backing, and the final victory will surely belong to the Japanese people and the Japanese working class. The conference also adopted a telegram from the Nanjing coal miners supporting the Japanese people's opposition to the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty to all workers of the Miike Coal Mine in Japan.
    On the same day, representatives of young students in Nanjing also held a rally. Student representatives from various schools attending the rally expressed their firm support for the struggle of Japanese young students to overthrow the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty and oppose the enslavement of U.S. imperialism. More than 8,000 teachers and students of Nanjing University have also held rallies and demonstrations in recent days to support the just struggle of the Japanese people. Young teachers and students of the History Department also compiled a 70,000-word booklet, "The Nanjing Massacre," exposing the towering crimes of the Japanese fascists in massacring the Chinese people in Nanjing in 1937. At that time, many Chinese people were massacred by Japanese imperialism in this school. The teachers and students of this school pointed out that the Chinese people will never allow the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries to collude again to harm the Japanese and Chinese people. The 650 million Chinese people resolutely support the Japanese people's just struggle against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries' conspiracy to plot a new war. (Photo attached)

    支持日本三池矿工的斗争
    南京三千煤矿工人集会
    据新华社南京25日电　南京市各界人民继续举行各种活动，支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争。
    政协江苏省及南京市委员会21日举行了集会。省、市各民主党派负责人和无党派民主人士在会上强烈地谴责美帝国主义指使岸信介反动集团用武力强迫日本众议院“通过”日美军事同盟条约的罪恶活动。
    民革江苏省委员会主任委员任崇高说，美帝国主义破坏四国政府首脑会议和指使它的走狗岸信介反动集团悍然使用警察暴力强使日本众议院通过侵略性的日美军事同盟条约，再一次证明美帝国主义是全世界人民的公敌。这只会更加激起日本人民、全世界人民的公愤，加速美帝国主义的灭亡。民盟江苏省委员会主任委员陈中凡说，中国人民坚决支持日本人民反对美帝国主义和推翻日美军事同盟条约的正义斗争，直到日本人民取得最后胜利。
    南京市三千多煤矿工人21日下午举行集会声援日本三池煤矿工人的正义斗争。他们在会上对为反对财阀解雇和日美军事同盟条约而坚持罢工八个月的三池煤矿工人，表示衷心的敬意和全力的支持。官塘煤矿工人代表陈汝华说：三池煤矿工人的斗争绝不是孤立的，强大的中国工人阶级是他们的可靠的后盾，最后的胜利一定是属于日本人民和日本工人阶级。大会还通过了南京市煤矿工人支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约给日本三池煤矿全体工人的通电。
    同一天，南京市青年学生的代表也举行了集会，参加集会的各校学生代表，对日本青年学生推翻日美军事同盟条约和反对美帝国主义奴役的斗争表示坚决的支持。南京大学的八千多师生连日来也举行了支持日本人民正义斗争的集会和示威。历史系青年教师和学生，还编写了一本七万字的小册子“南京大屠杀”，揭露日本法西斯1937年在南京屠杀中国人民的滔天罪行。当时，有许多中国人民就在这所学校里遭到日本帝国主义的屠杀。这个学校的师生们指出，中国人民决不允许美日反动派再勾结起来残害日本人民和中国人民，中国六亿五千万人民坚决支持日本人民反对美日反动派策划新战争阴谋的正义斗争。（附图片）
