    Grasp Mao Zedong Thought, Strengthen Investigation and Research
    Shang Zhen

    Comrade Mao Zedong has always regarded investigation and research as a matter of our Party's ideology and work style. In many documents such as the "Preface and Postscript to 'Rural Surveys'," "Reform Our Study," and the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Investigation and Research," the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong have repeatedly emphasized: "No investigation, no right to speak"; "Systematic and thorough social investigation is the basis for determining policy"; "The basic task of the leading organs lies in understanding the situation and mastering policy, the former being the so-called knowing the world, and the latter being the so-called transforming the world"; "Without a truly concrete understanding of China's various social classes, truly good leadership will be impossible." It was also pointed out: "For those who assume leadership positions, it is the most basic method of understanding the situation to plan and grasp several cities and villages, and make several thorough investigations using the basic viewpoints of Marxism, that is, the method of class analysis."

    For many years, we have followed Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions and have diligently conducted investigation and research in all aspects of revolution and construction. Therefore, we have been able to comprehensively understand the spirit of the Party's line, principles, and policies, closely connect with the masses, implement the Party's policies in accordance with the time, place, circumstances, and individuals, maintain a clear head, firmly struggle against all bourgeois ideas that oppose the Party's line, and victoriously complete various tasks. Looking back at the important turning points in our work in Hunan Province in recent years, we will have a deeper understanding of how the Provincial Party Committee and Party committees at all levels conducted investigation and research to guide the work. In the summer of 1955, the investigation conducted by the Hunan Provincial Party Committee in Qingxi Township, Xiangtan, and the investigation materials from various regions and county Party committees showed that the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement had significantly developed the productive forces. In terms of land utilization and yield levels, individual farmers, mutual aid teams, and elementary agricultural cooperatives were about one-half to one-third worse than advanced cooperatives. The possession of means of production by wealthy peasants and the activities of spontaneous capitalist forces in rural areas still hindered the further development of productive potential. This made us see the importance of accelerating cooperation and the urgent desire of poor and lower-middle peasants, both new and old, to "move forward with one heart" to realize cooperation. It also began to make us realize that new and old upper-middle peasants held different attitudes toward the cooperative movement. These investigations gave us preliminary ideological preparation for welcoming the high tide of cooperation. After Comrade Mao Zedong published the report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation," we were able to firmly mobilize and organize the broad masses to smoothly realize agricultural cooperation. In the summer of 1957, under the impact of the urban bourgeois rightists launching attacks on the Party and the summer famine in rural areas, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and a small number of wealthy middle peasants with serious spontaneous capitalist tendencies, under the guise of "contradictions among the people," seized on the issues of unified grain purchase and marketing and cooperation, and began to incite trouble. A considerable number of cadres in rural areas could not distinguish right from wrong, showed negativity and retreat, grain unified purchase progressed slowly, and production slackened. At this time, the Hunan Provincial Party Committee conducted an investigation in Gaoshan, Daxing, and Peitang three cooperatives in Gaoshan Township, Changsha County. From this investigation material and many materials from Party committees at all levels, it was seen that among those making trouble in rural areas, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements accounted for 75%, and wealthy middle peasants with serious spontaneous capitalist tendencies accounted for 25%, while poor and lower-middle peasants, both new and old, who accounted for more than 70% of the total rural population, demanded to "rectify" these "troublemakers." According to the central instructions and this specific situation, the Hunan Provincial Party Committee decided to universally launch a socialist education movement in rural areas, resolutely crack down on the crazy attacks of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, seize the season, promote production and grain unified purchase work, and then turn to a large-scale debate centered on the grain issue, criticizing the spontaneous capitalist ideas of a small number of wealthy middle peasants. This movement achieved a great victory, and in the winter of that year, it began to set off a high tide of the great leap forward in agricultural production. The struggle against right-leaning opportunists within the Party, which unfolded after August 1959 around the general line, the great leap forward, and the people's communes, was the most profound ideological revolution movement and also a movement of large-scale investigation and large-scale research. The whole Party started to investigate materials, calculate accounts, analyze, write articles, and reason, refuting the right-leaning opportunists to the point where they were speechless and had to bow their heads and admit their mistakes. This not only crushed their shameful attacks but also greatly improved our political, ideological, and theoretical levels, enabling us to more firmly and consciously implement the Party's line, principles, and policies. These few examples only illustrate the important role of leading organs in conducting investigation and research when dealing with major and key issues in several important periods. In the daily work of politics, economics, culture, education, ideology, theory, science, and technology, whether it is writing articles, making reports, setting plans, or proposing measures, all those who have earnestly and systematically conducted investigation and research and correctly grasped the Party's policies have achieved remarkable results. Those who neglect investigation and research and do not pay attention to policies are bound to have problems and make mistakes. From this, we understand even more clearly how important systematic and thorough investigation and research are to the practice and theory of revolution and construction.

    In recent years, the investigation and research work of Party organizations and various departments at all levels in Hunan Province has made great progress in terms of regularity, planning, and timeliness, has accumulated considerable rich materials and experience, increased leadership knowledge, and promoted various tasks. However, from the needs of the development of the situation and the Party's requirements for us, investigation and research work is still insufficient in terms of ideology, systematicness, and accuracy. For example, some investigation materials are verbose and have unclear purposes; some materials are not accurate enough; some materials are one-sided and fragmented and cannot be connected for historical comparison; some materials do not distinguish between primary and secondary aspects, list phenomena without forming a system of concepts and theories, and cannot grasp the main issues, and so on. This, in some cases, prevents us from effectively using investigation and research to guide our work. In order to adapt to the needs of the new situation and new tasks, we must further strengthen investigation and research work.

    Grasp the dialectical thinking of the theory of continuous revolution and the theory of the stages of revolutionary development

    To do a good job in investigation and research, the most fundamental thing is to study Marxism-Leninism and the works of Comrade Mao Zedong. Comrade Mao Zedong instructed us: "Marxist philosophy holds that the law of the unity of opposites is the fundamental law of the universe. This law exists universally in nature, human society, and people's thinking. Contradictory opposites are both unified and struggle, thereby promoting the movement and change of things"; "For any specific thing, the unity of opposites is conditional, temporary, and transitional, and therefore relative; the struggle of opposites is absolute" ("On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People"). "All contradictory things are interconnected, not only coexisting in a unity under certain conditions, but also transforming into each other under certain conditions" ("On Contradiction"). Therefore, correctly grasping Comrade Mao Zedong's thought on the dialectical unity of the theory of continuous revolution and the theory of the stages of revolutionary development, that is, the law of the struggle and unity of opposites in the development of things and the law of the mutual transformation of quantity and quality, is of particular importance for us to carry out investigation and research work.

    We know that socialism is only a transitional stage toward communism. In socialist society, the basic contradictions are the contradiction between the relations of production and the productive forces, and the contradiction between the superstructure and the economic base. The continuous emergence and resolution of contradictions promote the socialist revolution and construction cause to develop from one stage to another, uninterruptedly. And the entire transitional period contains several small stages. The tasks of revolution and construction in each small stage are proposed by our Party after investigating and researching the "major and non-major distinctions between contradictions and aspects of contradictions" and "the differences in various forms of struggle of contradictions" ("On Contradiction") in these stages. From this, it can be understood that we must have the thought of continuous revolution, observe things and analyze problems from a developmental point of view, so that we can always maintain a keen sense, be good at discovering new qualitative changes in the overall process of quantitative change in a timely manner, consciously support new things, and create conditions to promote the leap forward in the cause of revolution and construction.

    Our investigation and research work must always grasp the positive things, plant red flags widely, encourage people's fighting spirit, and point out the direction of progress, and ideologically and theoretically open up roads for new things. At the same time, it must be restricted by the theory of the stages of revolutionary development, that is to say, it must be realistic and objective, that is, to look at problems from a materialistic point of view, and must not "have subjective arbitrariness," transcend historical stages, and engage in unfounded wild thoughts. Since "all contradictory things are interconnected, not only coexisting in a unity under certain conditions, but also transforming into each other under certain conditions," we must conduct investigation and research from a comprehensive and interconnected point of view, that is, from the history, current situation, positive and negative aspects of things, the various aspects of internal contradictions of things, the contradictory movements of the connections and mutual influences between things, and the specific conditions that promote their mutual transformation, that is, from grasping the universality of contradictions to grasping the particularity of contradictions. In this way, we can correctly and timely adjust the contradictions between productive forces and relations of production, between economic base and superstructure, and between the various factors that constitute productive forces. For example, in the process of the people's commune transitioning from the current basic ownership by the production team to basic ownership by the commune, there is a contradiction between the state, the collective, and the individual. The fundamental way to resolve this contradiction is to rapidly develop production and continuously improve the communist consciousness of the masses. The decisive condition is the level of economic development of the commune and the degree of agricultural semi-mechanization and mechanization. However, if we do not use the method of "growing up," that is, first actively develop the production of the brigade, and at the same time actively develop the production of the commune at a higher speed, and use the development of the commune's economy to drive the development of the brigade's economy, but use the method of "taking over," not acknowledging the difference between the "poor" and "rich" production teams, and immediately implement basic ownership by the commune, it will affect the mood of the commune members and hinder the development of production. If that is the case, it will not only fail to resolve the existing contradictions but will also prolong the transition process. Therefore, at the current stage, it is necessary to resolutely prevent impatience, work hard and diligently to actively develop production, and strive to meet the conditions for realizing the transition as soon as possible. And once the commune's economy develops to a dominant position, and other conditions for the transition are met, that is, "when the new aspect gains a dominant position over the old aspect, the nature of the old thing changes to the nature of the new thing" ("On Contradiction"), the transition will naturally be realized. Therefore, we must continue to resolutely implement the three-level ownership system based on the production team, which is suitable for the current level of production and the level of consciousness of the masses, and is conducive to the development of productive forces, and there must be no wavering or doubt. On the other hand, the transition from the current basic ownership by the production team to basic ownership by the commune is the inevitable trend of the development of the people's commune. This direction must be clear. If we stop moving forward, it will be a very serious mistake. Our investigation and research is to often deal with various contradictions in the process of realizing the transition from the aspects of production and distribution issues. Therefore, how should the large-scale production of the commune be organized and led well? How to handle the relationship between various departments of agricultural economy and between industry and agriculture? How to correctly handle the relationship between accumulation and consumption? How to accelerate the realization of semi-mechanization and mechanization of agriculture? What measures should be taken to develop the commune-owned economy? How to arrange the proportion of the commune economy and the brigade economy in different aspects and different stages of development? How to continue to deepen the ideological struggle between the two roads to promote production and construction? Etc., are all issues that we need to investigate, understand, and solve. For new things that are growing in socialist society and old things that will be gradually eliminated, we can only correctly distinguish them by analyzing them from the point of view of combining the theory of continuous revolution and the theory of the stages of revolutionary development. For example, the distribution according to need system is still in its infancy, but it will become the dominant thing in communist society, and we must enthusiastically support it, actively create conditions, and promote its gradual development. Furthermore, commodities, currency, the law of value, etc., are dominant in capitalist society. In socialist society, their nature has changed. Although for a considerable period of time, we must use their side that is conducive to socialist construction and at the same time try to prevent them from playing a negative role, but from a developmental point of view, we must actively create conditions to finally eliminate them. Only in this way can the work avoid major twists and turns and develop smoothly. Understanding this is very important for doing investigation and research work.

          Adhere to the method of class analysis

    In investigation and research work, we must adhere to the basic viewpoint of Marxism, that is, the method of class analysis. This cannot be doubted or wavered. Right-leaning opportunists, starting from the absurd argument that the class struggle is extinguished, oppose our use of the method of class analysis to conduct investigation and research, which is fundamentally wrong. Because, to carry out a revolution, we must first distinguish who is the enemy of the revolution, who is the friend of the revolution, and who is the force on which the revolution relies, and then we can organize the revolutionary forces and realize the revolutionary tasks. In the situation where classes have not been completely eliminated and the class struggle in the political ideology and consciousness lasts for a long time, is it not absurd to not use the class analysis method to divide the boundaries between the enemy, friends, and ourselves? In addition, there are also a very few people with confused ideas who believe that class struggle requires class line and class analysis, and that socialist construction does not require class analysis. This is also incorrect. Because years of facts have proven that the implementation of the Party's general line for socialist construction is always permeated with the struggle between two ideologies and two roads. In the speed of production and construction, in the attitude towards difficulties and some shortcomings or errors in the work, and in the attitude towards new things, although the struggle between the new and the old, the correct and the wrong, is always permeated, they all contain and reflect class struggle to a certain extent first. "Without a correct political viewpoint, it is equivalent to having no soul." ("On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People") The political viewpoint referred to by Chairman Mao, when the class struggle still exists, is first of all the class viewpoint and the method of class analysis, and we must adhere to its application. The ideological method of right-leaning opportunists is the bourgeois subjective idealism. They can never faithfully reflect objective reality, but always arbitrarily exaggerate and distort from the standpoint of the bourgeoisie, attack one point without considering the rest, exaggerate local phenomena into essence, and separate knowledge and practice. Therefore, they cannot grasp the essence of things through phenomena, cannot distinguish between the mainstream and tributaries of things, and cannot make the subjective and objective consistent. From this, it can be known that not just anyone can master and apply the dialectical materialistic class analysis method, but only those who have truly established the proletarian worldview and adhere to the proletarian standpoint can do so.

    The Marxist method of class analysis is not simply to formally classify the surface phenomena of things and attach a label of class composition. Rather, it is to observe social phenomena, analyze the contradictions of things, grasp the essence of things through phenomena, that is, the objectively existing laws, and then correctly resolve contradictions using the dialectical materialistic epistemology and methodology. Therefore, any problem must be analyzed specifically according to the differences in time, place, and conditions. For example, we cannot look at the two sides of the wealthy middle peasants in general, but analyze the development and changes of its two sides from different conditions in different historical periods. During the democratic revolution, in the struggle against local tyrants and land reform, some of them benefited economically, while they generally maintained neutrality politically. Although there were contradictions between the proletariat and the wealthy middle peasants, they were not prominent at that time. By the time of the socialist revolution, when the landlord and rich peasant classes had been eliminated, the wealthy middle peasant class, as the upper-level petty bourgeoisie, became the main source of spontaneous capitalist forces in rural areas, and its contradiction with the proletariat gradually surfaced. Especially when the people's commune movement deepened and completely eliminated the private ownership economy, the contradiction between the proletariat and the wealthy middle peasants was not a contradiction on individual issues, but a struggle between two roads, a class struggle within the people, and the contradiction was sharpened. However, due to the different historical economic status and political consciousness, at the present stage, not only do the old and new upper-middle peasants have obvious differences in their attitude towards socialism, but the wealthy middle peasant class also has three parts: left, middle, and right. A very small number of people with serious spontaneous capitalist tendencies who openly oppose socialism are the right wing of the wealthy middle peasants (mainly the old upper-middle peasants before higher-level cooperatives). The anti-socialist words and deeds of these people have been greatly reduced after thorough exposure and criticism and education using the method of nationwide rectification. The majority of wealthy middle peasants generally tend towards socialism, but have varying degrees of wavering. The left wing of the wealthy middle peasants are advanced elements with communist consciousness, and this kind of person will gradually increase as the socialist revolution and construction cause increasingly achieves greater victories. Of course, the wavering attitude of the wealthy middle peasant class will exist for a considerable period of time before the realization of agricultural modernization. However, since the wealthy middle peasants are laborers (which is fundamentally different from the bourgeoisie), their interests are basically consistent with socialism. Because our policies are in line with the interests of all laborers, they no longer privately possess the means of production, the commune economy develops rapidly, income continues to increase, and the proletariat leads the poor and lower-middle peasants, both new and old, to resolutely criticize their spontaneous capitalist ideas, persistently carry out communist ideological education for them for a long time (which is also the self-transformation of all farmers), and adhere to the policy of unity, education, and transformation. The vast majority can also be transformed. In this class investigation in Shaoshan, we realized that to correctly grasp Comrade Mao Zedong's thoughts on class analysis and study the dynamics of various classes in rural areas at present, it is necessary to analyze the changes in various conditions from the political, economic, historical, and current aspects, and observe the different attitudes of various classes towards socialism in order to draw correct conclusions. If it is thought that the economic class form has basically disappeared, and the method of class analysis is no longer needed, it would be completely wrong.

    In short, objective things are very complicated, and people's understanding is also tortuous, gradually deepening, and improving. In order to prevent our thinking from lagging behind reality, the most important thing is to strengthen our understanding of objective reality. Through the continuous and repeated practice process, relying on the Marxist class analysis method, we can constantly expose the essence of things, that is, the laws, from any complex and changeable phenomenon, and in turn guide our practice.

    In investigation and research work, we already have a complete set of mass line methods of walking on two legs. That is: combining typical investigation with general investigation, combining politics with economics, combining regular investigation and statistics work with temporary census, combining research on special issues with comprehensive research, combining professional investigation and research institutions with the whole Party's participation, and so on. In the future, we will continue to enrich, supplement, and develop it with new practical experience as the work develops. What needs to be emphasized at present is that to do a good job in investigation and research, we must earnestly read more books, especially around the "three magic weapons" of the general line for building socialism, the development speed of the great leap forward, and the organizational form of the people's communes. We should carefully read Comrade Mao Zedong's works on philosophy and political economy and the works of other classic Marxist-Leninist writers, and constantly improve our political and ideological level and knowledge level. At the same time, we must further strengthen our mass viewpoint and political viewpoint. That is to say, we must truly integrate with the masses, make intimate friends, so that we can timely and accurately understand the most important and vivid situations. We must have the determination to be a willing pupil, humbly learn from the masses, respect the creativity of the masses, and earnestly discuss problems with the masses, so that we can look at problems as objectively and comprehensively as possible and avoid subjectivity and one-sidedness. That is to say, we must carry out investigation and research in a planned way around the central work of the Party in various periods, in accordance with the Party's intentions, and closely serve the central work.

    In order to further strengthen investigation and research work, the Hunan Provincial Party Committee recently decided that the leading organs above the county level should set up investigation and research institutions to carry out investigation and research work in a planned way. In particular, the main responsible comrades of Party committees at all levels should grasp the major issues of each period, personally go deep into the grassroots to conduct systematic investigation and research. They are also required that Party committees at all levels and various departments establish fixed bases for investigation and research, systematically accumulate materials, and study problems. They should also make the method of convening small forums for grassroots cadres to gather the masses and in-depth individual visits regular and form a system, regularly inspect the implementation, and promote grassroots cadres to regularly pay attention to systematically understanding the situation, studying problems, and improving work methods. At the same time, they should increase the content of investigation and research in the philosophy or business courses of Party schools and various cadre schools, and conduct education on understanding the objective situation and studying the Party's policies. We believe that the implementation of these measures will help further enrich leadership and promote various tasks.

    掌握毛泽东思想　加强调查研究工作
    尚真
    毛泽东同志从来都是把调查研究问题作为我们党的思想方法和工作作风问题看待的。在“‘农村调查’的序言和跋”、“改造我们的学习”、“中共中央关于调查研究的决定”等许多文献中，党中央和毛泽东同志多次强调地指出：“没有调查就没有发言权”；“系统的周密的社会调查是决定政策的基础”；“领导机关的基本任务，就在于了解情况和掌握政策两件大事，前一件事就是所谓认识世界，后一件事就是所谓改造世界”；“对于中国各个社会阶级的实际情况，没有真正具体的了解，真正好的领导是不会有的”。并且指出：“对于担负领导工作的人来说，有计划地抓住几个城市、几个乡村，用马克思主义的基本观点，即阶级分析的方法，作几次周密的调查，乃是了解情况的最基本的方法。”
    许多年来，我们遵循着毛泽东同志的指示，在革命和建设的一切工作中，认真地进行了调查研究，所以我们能够比较完整地领会党的路线、方针、政策的精神，能够紧密地联系群众，因时因地因事因人制宜地贯彻执行党的政策，能够保持清醒的头脑，坚定地和一切反对党的路线的资产阶级思想进行斗争，胜利地完成各项任务。回想最近几年，在我们湖南省工作中几个重要的转折关头，省委和各级党委怎样进行调查研究，指导工作，便会有更深切的体会。1955年夏季，中共湖南省委在湘潭清溪乡进行的调查和各地、县委的调查材料说明：互助合作运动的开展，使生产力有了显著的发展，在土地利用、产量水平等方面，个体农户、互助组与初级农业合作社相比较都要差一半到三分之一左右；而富裕农民对生产资料的占有情况和农村资本主义自发势力的活动，仍然阻碍着生产潜力的进一步发挥。这就使我们看到加速实现合作化的重要和贫农、新老下中农“一心向前”迫切要求实现合作化的愿望；并且开始发现新、老上中农对合作化运动抱有不同的态度。这些调查使我们有了迎接合作化高潮的初步思想准备，而在毛泽东同志发表了“关于农业合作化问题”的报告以后，我们就能够坚定地发动和组织广大群众，顺利地实现了农业合作化。1957年夏季，在城市资产阶级右派向党发动进攻和农村夏荒的影响下，地主、富农、反革命分子，结合一小部分有严重的资本主义自发思想的富裕中农，打着“人民内部矛盾”的幌子，抓住粮食统购统销和合作化问题，开始煽动闹事的时候，农村有相当一部分干部分不清是非，表现消极退缩，粮食统购进度迟缓，生产松弛。这时湖南省委在长沙县高山乡高山、大兴、培塘等三社进行了调查，从这个调查材料和各级党委的许多材料中看到，在农村闹事的人中间，地、富、反、坏分子占了75％，有严重资本主义自发思想的富裕中农占25％，而占农村总人口70％以上的贫农、新老下中农，要求“整治”这批“闹塘鱼”。湖南省委根据中央指示和这种具体情况，决定在农村普遍开展社会主义教育运动，坚决打击地、富、反、坏分子的疯狂进攻，争取季节，推动生产和粮食统购工作，然后转入以粮食问题为中心的大辩论，批判一小部分富裕中农的资本主义自发思想。这个运动取得了伟大胜利，当年冬天就开始掀起了农业生产大跃进的热潮。1959年8月以后围绕着总路线、大跃进、人民公社问题展开的党内反右倾机会主义分子的斗争，是最深刻的思想革命运动，同时也是一次大调查、大研究的运动。全党动手调查材料，算账、分析、写文章、讲道理，驳得右倾机会主义分子理屈词穷，不得不低头认错，不但粉碎了他们的可耻进攻，而且大大提高了我们的政治、思想、理论水平，使我们能够更加坚定和自觉地贯彻执行党的路线、方针、政策。这几个例子只是说明，在几个重要时期，领导机关在处理重大关键问题时进行调查研究的重要作用；就是在政治、经济、文教、思想、理论、科学技术等各方面的日常工作中，不论是写文章、作报告、定规划、提措施，凡是既认真、系统地进行了调查研究，又正确掌握了党的政策的，也都取得了显著的成绩，而忽略调查研究又不注意政策的，就一定出毛病、犯错误。由此我们就更加明白，进行系统的周密的调查研究，对于革命和建设的实践与理论是何等重要。
    近几年来湖南省各级党的组织和各个部门的调查研究工作，不论在经常性、计划性、及时性方面，都有很大进步，积累了相当丰富的资料和经验，增长了领导知识，推动了各项工作。但是，从形势发展的需要和党对我们的要求来说，调查研究工作在思想性、系统性、准确性等方面都还是不够的。例如，有的调查材料内容繁琐，目的不明；有的材料不够准确；有的材料片面、零碎而不能连贯地进行历史的比较；有的材料主次不分，现象罗列，没有形成概念和理论的系统，抓不住主要问题等等。这就在一些情况下使我们不能很好地运用调查研究来指导工作。为了适应新形势、新任务的需要，我们必须进一步加强调查研究工作。
    掌握不断革命论和革命发展阶段论的辩证思想
    要做好调查研究工作，最根本的一条是学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东同志的著作。毛泽东同志指示我们：“马克思主义的哲学认为，对立统一规律是宇宙的根本规律。这个规律，不论在自然界、人类社会和人们的思想中，都是普遍存在的。矛盾着的对立面又统一，又斗争，由此推动事物的运动和变化”；“对于任何一个具体的事物说来，对立的统一是有条件的、暂时的、过渡的，因而是相对的，对立的斗争则是绝对的。”（“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”）“一切矛盾着的东西，互相联系着，不但在一定条件之下共处于一个统一体中，而且在一定条件之下互相转化。”（“矛盾论”）所以，正确掌握毛泽东同志关于不断革命论和革命发展阶段论辩证统一的思想，亦即事物发展对立面的斗争与统一的规律和质量互变的规律，对于我们进行调查研究工作，有特别重要的意义。
    我们知道，社会主义只是走向共产主义的一个过渡阶段，在社会主义社会中，基本的矛盾仍然是生产关系和生产力之间的矛盾，上层建筑和经济基础之间的矛盾；矛盾的不断出现和不断解决，推动着社会主义革命和建设事业一个阶段接连一个阶段地、不间断地向前发展。而在整个过渡时期中，又包含着若干小阶段，每一个小阶段的革命和建设任务，都是我们党调查研究了这些阶段的“矛盾和矛盾方面的主要的和非主要的区别”，“矛盾的各种不同的斗争形式的区别”（“矛盾论”）以后提出来的。由此就可以明白：我们要有不断革命的思想，用发展的观点去观察事物，分析问题，才能经常保持敏锐的感觉，善于在总的量变过程中，及时发现新的质变，自觉的支持新生事物，创造条件，促使革命和建设事业飞跃前进。
    我们的调查研究工作，永远要抓住积极的东西，大插红旗，鼓舞人们的斗志，指出前进的方向，在思想上、理论上为新生事物开拓道路；同时，又必须受革命发展阶段论的制约，也就是说，必须现实的、客观的，即用唯物的观点去看问题，而不能“带主观的随意性”，超越历史阶段，脱离实际地、没有根据地去胡思乱想。既然“一切矛盾着的东西，互相联系着，不但在一定条件之下共处于一个统一体中，而且在一定条件之下互相转化”，我们做调查研究，就必须用全面的、联系的观点，即从事物的历史、现状、正面、反面、事物内部矛盾的各个方面，事物彼此之间的联系和相互影响的矛盾运动中，从促成它们互相转化的具体条件中，进行具体的分析；也就是从掌握矛盾的普遍性，进到掌握矛盾的特殊性。这样，才能正确地适时地调整生产力和生产关系之间、经济基础和上层建筑之间、构成生产力的各种因素之间的矛盾。例如，人民公社由现在的大队基本所有制过渡到公社基本所有制的过程中，贯穿着国家、集体和个人之间的矛盾，解决这个矛盾的根本办法是迅速发展生产，不断地提高群众的共产主义觉悟；而决定性的条件则是公社经济发展的水平，和农业半机械化、机械化的程度。但是，如果不用“长上来”的办法，即首先积极发展大队的生产，同时以较高的速度积极发展公社的生产，用公社经济的发展去带动大队经济的发展，而是用“拿过来”的办法，不承认各个生产队之间“穷”“富”的差别，马上实行公社基本所有制，那就会影响社员的情绪，妨碍生产的发展。如果那样，不但不能解决现存的矛盾，反而会拖长过渡的过程。因此，在目前阶段要切实防止急躁情绪，埋头苦干积极发展生产，力争早日具备实现过渡的条件。而一当公社经济发展到占优势地位，过渡的其他条件也都具备的时候，即“新的方面对于旧的方面取得支配地位的时候，旧事物的性质就变化为新事物的性质”（“矛盾论”），过渡就自然而然地实现了。所以，我们必须继续坚决贯彻执行适合于目前生产水平和群众觉悟水平、有利于生产力发展的、以队为基础的三级所有制，不能有任何动摇和怀疑。另一方面，由现在的大队基本所有制过渡到公社基本所有制，是人民公社发展的必然趋势，这个方向要明确，如果停步不前，那就是十分错误的。我们做调查研究就是要经常从生产问题上和分配问题上处理实现过渡过程中的各种矛盾。因此，公社的大生产如何组织、如何领导才好？怎样处理农业经济各部门之间和工农业之间的关系？如何正确处理积累和消费的关系？如何加速实现农业的半机械化和机械化？采取什么办法发展社有经济？如何安排公社经济和大队经济在不同方面和不同发展阶段上的比例？如何继续深入开展两条道路的思想斗争以推动生产建设？等等，都是我们要调查了解并加以研究解决的问题。对于社会主义社会中正在成长的新事物和将要逐步消灭的旧事物，也只有用不断革命论和革命发展阶段论相结合的观点去分析，才能正确地区别对待。例如，按需分配制度现在还是处于萌芽状态，但到了共产主义社会将变成占统治地位的东西，必须热情支持，积极创造条件，促其逐步发展。再如，商品、货币、价值规律等等，在资本主义社会是统治的东西，在社会主义社会中，它们的性质已经发生了变化，虽然在相当长的时期内，还要利用其有利于社会主义建设的一面，同时尽力防止它们起消极作用，但从发展的观点看，必须积极创造条件来最后消灭它们。只有这样，才能使工作避免大的曲折，顺利向前发展。做调查研究工作理解这一点是非常重要的。
          坚持阶级分析的方法
    在调查研究工作中必须坚持马克思主义的基本观点，即阶级分析的方法，这是不能怀疑和动摇的。右倾机会主义分子从阶级斗争熄灭的荒谬论点出发，反对我们用阶级分析的方法进行调查研究，是根本错误的。因为，进行革命首先要分清什么人是革命的敌人，什么人是革命的朋友，什么人是革命的依靠力量，然后才能组织革命力量，实现革命任务。在阶级没有彻底消灭，政治思想和意识形态方面的阶级斗争长期存在的情况下，不用阶级分析方法来划分敌友我的界线，岂不荒谬？此外，也还有极少数思想糊涂的人认为，进行阶级斗争要阶级路线和阶级分析，进行社会主义建设就可以不要阶级分析，这也是不对的。因为多年的事实证明，贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线当中始终贯穿着两种思想、两条道路的斗争。在对生产建设的速度上，在对待困难和对工作的某些缺点或错误的看法上，在对待新事物的态度上，虽然贯穿着新与旧、正确与错误的斗争，但首先都在一定程度上包含着、反映着阶级斗争。“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂。”（“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”）毛主席所指的政治观点，在阶级斗争还存在的时候，首先就是阶级观点和阶级分析的方法，我们必须坚持运用它。右倾机会主义分子的思想方法，是资产阶级的主观唯心主义，他们从来不能忠实地反映客观实际，而总是站在资产阶级的立场上任意地夸大和歪曲，攻其一点，不及其余，把局部的现象夸大为本质，把认识和实践割裂开来，所以他们不能透过现象抓住事物的本质，不能分清事物的主流和支流，不能使主观和客观相一致。由此可知，并不是随便什么人都能掌握和运用辩证唯物主义的阶级分析方法，而只有真正确立了无产阶级世界观，坚持无产阶级立场的人才能做到。
    马克思主义的阶级分析的方法，并不是只就事物的表面现象形式地加以分类，插上一个阶级成分的标签；而是用辩证唯物主义的认识论和方法论，去观察社会现象，分析事物的矛盾，透过现象抓住事物的本质，即客观存在的规律性，然后去正确地解决矛盾。所以研究任何问题都要因时间、地点、条件的不同进行具体地分析。例如，我们不能笼统地看待富裕中农的两面性，而要从不同历史时期的不同条件去分析它的两面性的发展变化。民主革命时期，在反霸和土改斗争中，他们有些人在经济上得到利益，在政治上则一般地保持中立；无产阶级和富裕中农之间虽然有矛盾，但当时并不突出。到了社会主义革命时期，在地主、富农阶级已经消灭的情况下，作为上层小资产者的富裕中农阶层，就成为农村中资本主义自发势力的主要发生地了，它与无产阶级的矛盾就逐渐表面化了。特别是当人民公社化运动深入发展，彻底消灭私有制经济的时候，无产阶级和富裕中农的矛盾，就不是个别问题上的矛盾，而是两条道路的斗争、人民内部的阶级斗争了，矛盾就尖锐化了。但是，由于历史的经济地位和政治觉悟的不同，在现阶段，不但老上中农和新上中农对待社会主义的态度有较明显的不同，而且富裕中农这个阶层也有左、中、右这三部分。有严重的资本主义自发倾向、公然反对社会主义的极少数人，是富裕中农中的右翼（主要是高级化以前的老上中农），这些人反社会主义的言行，经过彻底的揭发批判，用全民整风的方法予以教育，已经大大减少。富裕中农的大部分，一般地倾向于社会主义，而又有不同程度的动摇性。富裕中农的左翼，是有共产主义觉悟的先进分子，这种人将随着社会主义革命和建设事业日益取得更大的胜利而逐渐增加。当然，富裕中农这个阶层的动摇态度，在实现农业现代化以前的相当长时期内都会存在。但是，由于富裕中农是劳动者（这是与资产阶级根本不同的），他们的利益与社会主义是基本一致的，由于我们的政策符合所有劳动者的利益，在他们不再私人占有生产资料，公社经济迅速发展，收入不断增加，以及无产阶级领导贫农和新老下中农坚决批判他们的资本主义自发思想，长期地坚持对他们进行共产主义思想教育（同时也是对全体农民的自我改造），坚持团结、教育、改造的方针的条件下，绝大多数也是能够改造过来的。这次我们在韶山的阶级调查中体会到：正确掌握毛泽东同志关于阶级分析的思想，研究目前农村各个阶级的动态，就要从政治、经济、历史、现状各个方面，分析各种条件的变化，观察各个阶级对社会主义的不同态度，才能得出正确的结论。如果认为经济上的阶级形态基本消失，就可以不要阶级分析的方法了，那就是完全错误的。
    总之，客观事物是非常复杂的，人底认识也是曲折的、逐步深化和提高的，为了使我们的思想不落后于实际，最要紧的是加强我们对客观情况的了解。经过不断反复的实践过程，依靠马克思主义阶级分析的方法，我们就能不断地从任何复杂多变的现象中，把事物的本质即规律性揭露出来，反过来又指导我们的实践。
    在调查研究工作中，我们已经有了一整套两条腿走路的群众路线的方法。这就是：典型调查与一般调查相结合，政治与经济相结合，经常性的调查统计工作和一时性的普查相结合，专门问题的研究与综合性的研究相结合，专业调查研究机关与全党动手相结合等等。今后我们还要随着工作的发展，不断地以新的实践经验去丰富它、补充它、发展它。当前要强调的是，要做好调查研究工作，必须认真地多读些书，特别是围绕建设社会主义的总路线、大跃进的发展速度和人民公社的组织形式这“三大法宝”，精读毛泽东同志的哲学、政治经济学方面的著作和马克思列宁主义其他经典作家的著作，不断提高我们的政治思想水平和知识水平。同时，必须进一步加强我们的群众观点和政治观点。就是说，要与群众真正打成一片，交知心朋友，才能及时地、准确地了解到最重要、最生动的情况；要有甘当小学生的决心，虚心向群众学习，尊重群众的创造，认真和群众一道商量问题，才能尽可能地作到客观的全面的看问题，而避免主观性和片面性。也就是说，要围绕党在各个时期的中心工作，按照党的意图，有计划地进行调查研究，紧密地为中心工作服务。
    为了进一步加强调查研究工作，最近中共湖南省委决定县以上的领导机关设置调查研究机构，有计划地进行调查研究工作，特别是各级党委的主要负责同志，要抓住每一个时期的重大问题，亲自深入基层进行系统的调查研究；并且要求各级党委和各个部门，都建立调查研究的固定基点，系统地积累资料，研究问题；把基层干部召集群众开小型座谈会和个别深入访问的方法经常化，形成制度，定期考察执行情况，推动基层干部经常注意系统了解情况，研究问题，改进工作方法；同时在各级党校和各种干部学校的哲学或业务课程中，增加调查研究的内容，进行关于了解客观情况、研究党的政策的教育。我们相信这些措施的实施将有助于进一步丰富领导，推动各项工作。
