    Stop the Heinous Activities of the American and Japanese Reactionaries
    After the provocative incident of the American plane intruding into Soviet airspace for espionage activities was exposed to the world, Japanese newspapers and Socialist Party members also revealed that there were also American U-2 aircraft in Japan conducting espionage activities against the Soviet Union and China. Japanese opposition parties demanded that the Nobusuke Kishi government take measures to ensure that all American U-2 aircraft immediately leave Japan.
    According to Japanese press reports, the American "Lockheed U-2" jet aircraft were transported to Japan as early as March 22, 1957, and were called "mysterious black jet aircraft" by the Japanese people because they had no international markings, the entire fuselage was painted black, and the mission was unclear. The fact that these aircraft took off from Atsugi base every day has become a well-known fact to local residents. In September 1959, one such aircraft made a forced landing in Fujisawa, Kanagawa Prefecture. At that time, the U.S. military authorities stationed in Japan immediately took extraordinary coercive measures in the area. It not only rudely drove away Japanese residents who were watching, but even ran into the homes of Japanese people who had witnessed the plane landing to conduct searches. The arrogance of the U.S. military authorities in the Fujisawa incident aroused great indignation among the Japanese people. Only the Kishi Nobusuke government tried its best to explain it as "a means taken by the United States to prevent danger and confusion." For several years, the progressive Japanese newspapers have continuously revealed that the mission of the U.S. U-2 aircraft stationed in Japan is to conduct espionage activities and collect intelligence on China and the Soviet Union. Members of the Japanese Socialist Party also strongly pursued the Nobusuke Kishi government several times in the Japanese Diet in December 1959 and April 1960. At the plenary session of the House of Representatives on December 1 last year, Socialist Party member Kazuo Asukata also gave a detailed explanation of the performance of the American "black jet aircraft." Despite Nobusuke Kishi's tireless efforts to excuse his American masters, nonsense such as the American "U-2" aircraft in Japan "belong to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration," "are only used for meteorological observations," and "the claim that it is engaged in espionage is just a rumor" …Now, because the American U-2 aircraft that invaded Soviet airspace was shot down, Nobusuke Kishi's monstrous lies cannot but be completely bankrupt. Socialist Party member Kazuo Asukata also recently revealed that the Nobusuke Kishi government's "Defense Agency" drew up an aviation map based on information provided by the U.S. military, which detailed areas including Yunnan, Guilin, Kinmen, Matsu, and Northeast China, as well as Kamchatka in the Soviet Union. This not only shows how rampant the U.S. aircraft's high-altitude espionage activities have become, but also shows that Japanese militarists are preparing an aggressive plan targeting China and the Soviet Union.
    White, the U.S. State Department's press officer, issued another shameless statement on the 10th regarding the incident of U.S. aircraft invading Soviet airspace for espionage activities. He specifically stated that the U.S. government had "assured" Japan that the flights of U-2 aircraft operating from its bases in Japan "have been, and will continue to be, used only for legitimate and normal purposes, and not for transborder intelligence gathering missions." However, people know that in the U.S. State Department's statement on the 7th, military reconnaissance by U.S. aircraft invading Soviet airspace was also called "legitimate defense measures," then the meaning of "legitimate and normal purposes" in White's statement is obviously the same. The Japanese people know what it will mean if U.S. aircraft continue to use Japan as a base to conduct espionage activities against China and the Soviet Union. Soviet Premier Khrushchev has announced that the Soviet Union will strike at the bases that allow U.S. aircraft to take off from there and invade the Soviet Union. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary for the Japanese people to demand the withdrawal of U.S. aircraft from Japan.
    The fundamental reason why U.S. aircraft can use Japan as a base to conduct espionage activities against China and the Soviet Union lies in the collusion between the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries in signing the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. According to this treaty, the United States can not only station U-2 aircraft in Japan, but also, in fact, has stationed bombers with nuclear weapons. The stationing of the U.S. armed forces in Japan not only damages Japan's independence and sovereignty, but also runs the risk of dragging Japan into aggressive wars launched by the United States at any time. Therefore, the struggle against the stationing of U.S. U-2 aircraft in Japan must ultimately become a struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.
    Currently, the Japanese people are launching the 16th unified action against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. The exposure of U.S. aircraft using Japanese bases to conduct espionage activities against China and the Soviet Union will undoubtedly further stimulate the fighting will of the Japanese people. It is very clear that only by carrying this struggle to the end and completely smashing the criminal plan of aggression and war by the collusion between U.S. imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries represented by the Nobusuke Kishi government can Japan be spared from another war disaster.
    In this heroic struggle, the Japanese people can fully count on the support of the 650 million Chinese people. At present, unprecedented large-scale demonstrations against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty are being launched throughout China. The Chinese people deeply know that U.S. imperialism is our mortal enemy. The Nobusuke Kishi government colluded with U.S. imperialism, signed a military alliance treaty, and completely placed itself in a hostile position against China. The Chinese people will never allow Japanese militarism to make a comeback and bully us, and we are never afraid of U.S. imperialism. We warn the Nobusuke Kishi government that if it continues to allow U.S. aircraft to use Japan as a base to conduct espionage activities against China, then it must bear all the consequences arising therefrom. The military alliance treaty signed by the Nobusuke Kishi government with the United States is a noose around its neck. With the development of the struggle of the Japanese people, the Chinese people, and the people of Asian countries, this noose will become tighter and tighter. U.S. imperialism and the Nobusuke Kishi government have committed serious crimes, and the people will never forgive them.

### 制止美日反动派的罪恶活动

    制止美日反动派的罪恶活动
    美国飞机侵入苏联领空从事间谍活动的挑衅事件暴露于世以后，日本报纸和社会党议员又揭露了在日本也有美国的Ｕ—2型喷气式飞机，对苏联和中国进行间谍活动。日本各反对党要求岸信介政府采取措施使美国的Ｕ—2型喷气式飞机立即全部离开日本。
    据日本报刊披露，美国“洛克希德Ｕ—2型”喷气式飞机早在1957年3月22日就被运进日本，因为它们没有国际标志、整个机体涂成黑色和任务不明而被日本人民称为“神秘的黑色喷气式飞机”。这种飞机的每天从厚木基地起飞，已成为当地居民人所周知的事实。1959年9月，有一架这样的飞机曾在神奈川县的藤泽迫降。当时驻日美军当局立即在当地采取了异乎寻常的强制措施。它不仅粗暴地驱赶日本居民观看，甚至跑到曾目睹飞机降落的日本人家中进行搜查。美军当局在藤泽事件中的横暴，曾引起了日本人民极大的愤慨，只有岸信介政府，竭力把它解释为“美国为了防止危险和混乱而采取的手段”。关于美国驻日Ｕ—2型飞机的任务是进行间谍活动、搜集中苏情报，日本的进步报纸几年来曾不断进行揭露。日本社会党的议员也曾于1959年12月、1960年4月几次在日本国会上对岸信介政府进行强烈追究。日本社会党议员飞鸟田一雄在去年12月1日的众议院全体会议上，并曾专门对美国“黑色喷气式飞机”的性能作了详细说明。尽管岸信介不遗余力地为它的美国主子开脱，胡说什么在日本的美国“Ｕ—2型”飞机“是属于国家航空和宇宙航行局的飞机”，“仅仅用于气象观测”，“说它进行特务活动，不过是谣传”……现在，由于美国侵入苏联上空的Ｕ—2型飞机被击落，岸信介的弥天大谎就无法不遭到彻底的破产。日本社会党议员飞鸟田一雄最近还揭露，岸信介政府的“防卫厅”绘制一种由美军提供资料的航空地图，其中详细地绘画了包括中国的云南、桂林、金门、马祖和东北等地区以及苏联的堪察加等地方。这不但表明美国飞机的高空间谍活动已经到了何等猖狂的地步，而且还表明日本的军国主义分子准备着以中苏为对象的侵略计划。
    美国国务院新闻发布官怀特10日就美国飞机侵犯苏联领空进行间谍活动事件再次发表了一篇无耻谈话。他特别声明美国政府已向日本“保证”，美国从它驻日本基地起飞的Ｕ—2型飞机的飞行“一直是、而且将继续是仅仅用来从事合法的和正常的目的，而不是用来从事搜集情报的越界飞行任务。”但是，人们知道，美国国务院在7日的声明中，把美机侵入苏联领空进行军事侦察也叫做“正当的国防措施”，那末，怀特声明中的“合法的和正常的目的”的含义显然也是这样。日本人民知道，美国飞机继续以日本为基地对中苏进行间谍活动将意味着什么。苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫已经宣布，苏联将打击那些允许美国飞机从那里起飞侵入苏联的基地。因此，日本人民要求美国飞机撤出日本是完全必要的。
    美国飞机所以能够以日本为基地对中苏进行间谍活动，根本的原因在于美日反动派相互勾结，签订了美日军事同盟条约。美国根据这个条约不但可以在日本驻有Ｕ—2型飞机，而且还可以，事实上已经驻有带有核武器的轰炸机。美国武装部队驻扎在日本，不但损害日本的独立和主权，而且随时有把日本拖进美国发动的侵略战争中去的危险。因此反对美国Ｕ—2型飞机驻扎日本的斗争，归根到底，不能不成为反对美日军事同盟条约的斗争。
    目前日本人民正展开反对美日军事同盟条约的第十六次统一行动。美国飞机利用日本基地对中苏进行间谍活动的暴露，毫无疑问将更加激发日本人民的斗争意志。事情十分明显，只有把这个斗争进行到底，彻底粉碎美帝国主义和以岸信介政府为代表的日本反动派相互勾结的侵略战争的罪恶计划，才能避免日本又一次陷入战争的灾难中。
    日本人民在这个英勇的斗争中完全可以指望六亿五千万中国人民的支持。目前中国全国各地正展开规模空前的反对美日军事同盟条约的大示威。中国人民深知，美帝国主义是我们的死敌。岸信介政府同美帝国主义勾结，签订军事同盟条约，把它自己完全置于同中国相敌对的地位。中国人民绝不容许日本军国主义卷土重来欺侮我们，也绝不害怕美帝国主义。我们警告岸信介政府，如果它继续容许美国飞机以日本为基地对中国进行间谍活动，那末它就必须承担由此引起的一切后果。岸信介政府同美国签订的军事同盟条约，是套在它脖子上的一个绞索。随着日本人民、中国人民以及亚洲各国人民的斗争的发展，这个绞索将越来越紧。美帝国主义和岸信介政府已经犯下了严重的罪行，人民是决不会宽恕他们的。
