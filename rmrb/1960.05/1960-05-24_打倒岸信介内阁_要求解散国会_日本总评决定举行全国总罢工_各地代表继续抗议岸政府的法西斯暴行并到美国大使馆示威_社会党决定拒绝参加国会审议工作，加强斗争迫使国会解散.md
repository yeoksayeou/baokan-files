Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd Dispatch: The Japan General Council of Trade Unions held a meeting of its executive committee today, deciding to instruct all its member unions to hold a massive national general strike on June 4th to strive to overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet, dissolve the Diet, and prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty."

　　The General Council of Trade Unions will submit this general strike plan for approval at an emergency representatives meeting to be held tomorrow.

　　This largest trade union in Japan, with 3.6 million members, also decided to call on all other trade unions to jointly hold a general strike.

　　The General Council of Trade Unions has already instructed all its affiliated unions to hold half-hour strikes on May 26th and to continue holding rallies and demonstrations in various places to protest Nobusuke Kishi's fascist atrocities and prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty."

　　In addition, the All-Japan Trade Union Conference also decided on the 21st to oppose the new "Security Treaty" and demand the resignation of Nobusuke Kishi and the dissolution of the Diet. It decided to hold workplace rallies and launch a signature campaign from the 24th to the end of the month.

　　The Japan Federation of Industrial Organizations also decided today to launch a national petition movement demanding the dissolution of the Diet and the overthrow of the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet. This union also decided to oppose U.S. President Eisenhower's visit to Japan.

　　The meeting decided to focus on these two points and, together with the Socialist Party, the Democratic Socialist Party, the Japan General Council of Trade Unions, the All-Japan Trade Union Conference, and the Federation of Independent Unions, launch a national movement against the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

　　Prior to this, this union had adopted a passive attitude towards joint struggles with the Socialist Party and the Japan General Council of Trade Unions in opposing the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd Dispatch: Five hundred action team members of the Japanese Socialist Party marched and demonstrated in front of Nobusuke Kishi's official residence this morning, demanding the resignation of the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet and the dissolution of the Diet.

　　Around noon, the procession also held a sit-down demonstration in front of the U.S. Embassy in Japan, demanding a meeting with responsible officials of the embassy. The slogans shouted by the demonstrators reverberated around the U.S. Embassy: "We oppose Ike's visit to Japan!" "Withdraw the Black Jet fighters from Japan!" "Yankees go home!"

　　In the afternoon, three hundred representatives from local organizations of the Socialist Party and more than four hundred representatives from joint struggle organizations from various regions gathered at the back gate of the Diet building. Starting from there, they marched towards Nobusuke Kishi's private residence, holding a two-hour demonstration. They called on passersby to rise up and protest against Nobusuke Kishi.

　　The demonstration demanded a meeting with Nobusuke Kishi, but was refused. Therefore, they sat down in front of Nobusuke Kishi's residence and held a sit-down demonstration, and once again held a street demonstration.

　　Fearing the rising mass protest movement, the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet has dispatched police teams and armored police vehicles to defend the inside and around Nobusuke Kishi's official residence, and has spread barbed wire around the official residence walls.

　　Approximately 1,200 students demonstrated in Tokyo this afternoon, demanding the dissolution of the Diet. They shouted slogans such as "Down with Nobusuke Kishi!" "We do not agree with the Diet's decision!" "The new treaty passed is invalid!" and held a two-hour demonstration in front of Nobusuke Kishi's official residence.

　　As they were leaving the official residence to demonstrate in the streets, several teams of police stationed at the official residence suddenly attacked the demonstrating students. Dozens of students were injured in the chaos, and some were arrested. The students fought back against the police attack. Subsequently, the students held demonstrations in the main streets of Tokyo's bustling areas. The police attacked the students again.

　　This morning, in Sapporo, Hokkaido, about thirty students held a protest demonstration in front of the local organization office of the Liberal Democratic Party in Hokkaido. The students wrote slogans such as "Down with Nobusuke Kishi" on the office's door and pillars.

　　Representatives from various districts of Tokyo and neighboring prefectures also continued to petition and demonstrate at the Diet today, demanding the immediate dissolution of the Diet.

　　Joint struggle organizations throughout Japan against the new "Security Treaty" also carried out extensive publicity activities and signature campaigns on the streets today, and held bicycle parades to protest the fascist atrocities of the Nobusuke Kishi clique in forcibly voting on the new "Security Treaty" by bringing police into the Diet.

　　In the afternoon, one hundred representatives from Gunma also held demonstrations in front of Nobusuke Kishi's official residence and the U.S. Embassy.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd Dispatch: At a meeting to study the current Japanese political situation, the Central Executive Committee of the Japanese Socialist Party today considered that, in order to prevent the establishment of the new "Security Treaty," it is not enough to merely have the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet resign. It is necessary to continue to refuse participation in Diet deliberations and strengthen struggles outside the Diet to quickly force the Diet to dissolve before the new "Security Treaty" is "naturally established" on June 19th.

　　Since Nobusuke Kishi forcibly extended the Diet session in the House of Representatives by fifty days and "approved" the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," the opposition parties have refused to attend Diet meetings. Therefore, the Japanese Diet has been in a state of suspension since the 20th.

　　The Socialist Party decided that, if necessary, even if all Socialist Party members of the Diet resign, they must force the Nobusuke Kishi government to dissolve the Diet.

　　The meeting decided that Socialist Party Chairman Inejiro Asanuma and other leaders will meet with Nobusuke Kishi tomorrow to firmly demand the dissolution of the Diet, demand the resignation of the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet, and demand that the "passage" of the new "Security Treaty" by the House of Representatives be declared invalid.

　　In addition, Socialist Party Secretary-General Saburo Eda and others met with House of Councillors Speaker Tsuruhei Matsuno today to oppose the convening of a meeting of the House of Councillors. The representatives of the Socialist Party pointed out that to solve the current “blank” problem of the Diet, there is no other way but to dissolve the Diet and for Nobusuke Kishi to resign.

　　Socialist Party House of Representatives member Hisao Kuroda also revealed today that "the Liberal Democratic Party is now planning to approve this treaty in the House of Councillors, attended only by ruling party members, within thirty days after the so-called passage of the treaty by the House of Representatives (new "Security Treaty"), before the treaty automatically takes effect."

　　Hisao Kuroda emphasized that in order to dissolve the Diet as soon as possible, mass actions outside the Diet should be intensified immediately. He pointed out that at this stage, petitions and demonstrations alone are not enough. The more important action is workers' strikes.

    社会党决定拒绝参加国会审议工作，加强斗争迫使国会解散
    新华社23日讯　东京消息：日本工会总评议会今天举行干事会会议，决定将指令它的全体会员工会在6月4日举行声势浩大的全国性总罢工，争取打倒岸信介内阁、解散国会，阻止批准新“安全条约”。
    总评议会将把这个总罢工计划提交在明天召开的紧急代表会议通过。
    这个拥有三百六十万会员的日本最大工会还决定呼吁其他所有工会共同举行总罢工。
    总评议会已经指令所属全体工会在5月26日分别举行半个小时的罢工，并在各地继续举行集会和示威游行，抗议岸信介的法西斯暴行和阻止批准新“安全条约”。
    另外，全日本工会会议在21日也决定反对新“安全条约”，要求岸信介辞职和解散国会。它决定，将从24日到月底，举行工作场所大会和展开签名运动。
    日本全国产业别工会会议今天也决定展开要求解散国会和打倒岸信介内阁的国民请愿运动。这个工会还决定反对美国总统艾森豪威尔访问日本。
    会议决定以这两点为中心，同社会党、民主社会党、日本工会总评议会、全日本工会会议、中立工会联合会一起展开反对新日美“安全条约”的国民运动。
    在这以前，这个工会在反对新日美“安全条约”方面采取着不同社会党和日本工会总评议会进行联合斗争的消极态度。”
    据新华社23日讯　东京消息：日本社会党的五百个行动队员今天上午在岸信介官邸前游行示威，要求岸信介内阁辞职和解散国会。
    将近中午，游行队伍还到美国驻日本大使馆前面举行静坐示威，要求会见大使馆负责官员。在美国大使馆四周响彻着示威者高呼的口号：“我们反对艾克访问日本！”“把黑色喷气机撤出日本！”“美国佬滚回去！”
    下午，社会党地方组织代表三百人和各地共同斗争组织的代表四百多人集合在国会大厦后门。他们以这里为起点，向岸信介私人住宅前进，举行了两个钟头的示威游行。他们呼吁路过的市民起来向岸信介抗议。
    示威队伍要求会见岸信介，但是遭到拒绝。于是，在岸信介住宅门前坐下来举行静坐示威，并且再一次在街上举行了示威游行。
    岸信介内阁害怕日益高涨的群众抗议运动，已经派遣了警察队和装甲警车在岸信介官邸内和周围设防，并在官邸围墙周围遍布铁丝网。
    大约一千二百名学生今天下午在东京示威，要求解散国会。他们高呼“打倒岸信介！”“我们不同意国会的决定！”“通过的新条约是无效的！”等口号，在岸信介的官邸前面举行了两小时的示威。
    当他们将离开官邸准备到街上去示威的时候，驻守在官邸的几队警察突然向示威的学生袭击。在混乱中有几十个学生被打伤，还有一些人被捕。学生们反击了警察的进攻。随后，学生们在东京热闹地区各条大街举行了示威游行。警察们再次向学生袭击。
    今天清晨，在北海道的扎幌市约有三十个学生在自由民主党北海道地方组织的办事处前面举行抗议示威。学生们在办事处的门上和柱子上写了“打倒岸信介”等口号。
    东京各区和邻近各县代表今天也继续到国会进行请愿示威，要求立即解散国会。
    日本全国各地反对新“安全条约”共同斗争组织今天还在街头展开了广泛的宣传活动和签名运动，同时举行自行车游行，抗议岸信介集团把警察引进国会强行表决新“安全条约”的法西斯暴行。
    在下午，来自群马的一百名代表也在岸信介官邸和美国大使馆门前举行示威。
    新华社23日讯　东京消息：日本社会党中央执行委员会今天在研究当前日本政治局势的会议上认为，为了阻止新“安全条约”的成立，只使岸信介内阁辞职还是不够的，必须继续拒绝参加国会的审议工作，加强国会外面的斗争，来迅速迫使国会在6月19日新“安全条约”“自然成立”以前解散。
    在岸信介强使众议院延长国会会期五十天和“批准”新日美“安全条约”以后，在野党一直拒绝出席国会会议，因此，日本国会从20日起一直陷于停顿状态。
    社会党决定，在必要的时候，即使社会党议员全体辞职，也要迫使岸信介政府解散国会。
    会议决定，社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎等领导人将在明天会见岸信介，坚决要求解散国会，要求岸信介内阁总辞职，并且要求宣布众议院对新“安全条约”的“通过”无效。
    另外，社会党书记长江田三郎等人今天会见参议院议长松野鹤平，反对参议院召开会议。社会党的代表指出，要解决现在国会的
  “空白”问题，除了解散国会和岸信介辞职以外，没有其他道路。
    社会党众议院议员黑田寿男今天还揭露，“自由民主党现在打算在所谓众议院通过（新“安全条约”）以后的三十天内、条约自动生效以前，在由执政党议员单独参加的参议院中批准这项条约”。
    黑田寿男强调指出，为了尽早解散国会，应该立刻加紧国会以外的群众行动。他指出，在现阶段，光是请愿和示威还不够。更重要的行动是工人的罢工。
