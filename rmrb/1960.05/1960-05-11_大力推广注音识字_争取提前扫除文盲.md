The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China today issued instructions on promoting phonetic literacy. The instructions pointed out that the experience of Wanrong County, Shanxi Province, in phonetic literacy is a very important creation in China's cultural revolution, calling on the whole country to quickly promote this experience and strive to eliminate illiteracy ahead of schedule.

The outstanding achievements of Wanrong County, Shanxi Province, in using pinyin letters to accelerate the speed of literacy and consolidate and expand the results of literacy have been clearly stated in the report of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee to the Central Committee, and this newspaper has also reported on it in the past. At present, in Shanxi, Shandong, Jilin, Hebei, Anhui, Sichuan, Hubei, Liaoning, Beijing and other provinces and cities, a phonetic literacy movement of learning from Wanrong and catching up with Wanrong is booming.

The experience of various regions continues to prove that phonetic literacy is a good method to eliminate illiteracy more, faster, better, and more economically, and to consolidate and expand the results of literacy. In areas where phonetic literacy has been carried out, the learning confidence of the masses has been greatly encouraged, and the number of participants in learning has increased rapidly. A surge of the whole people learning pinyin letters has been set off in Shanxi Province, and the number of participants in learning, including students and children, has approached 40% of the province's population. The number of learners in Jinan Prefecture has reached 2.05 million, exceeding 80% of the total number of young and middle-aged people in the prefecture. The number of students in literacy classes and spare-time schools participating in phonetic literacy in Shandong Province has reached 4.55 million. These numbers are constantly increasing.

According to the experience of various regions, illiterate and semi-literate people can generally learn the pinyin scheme after 20 to 30 hours of teaching. After another 100 to 150 hours of reading and writing teaching, they can recognize 1,500 characters and reach the literacy graduation standard. After the masses master the pinyin tool and recognize more than 1,000 Chinese characters, they can read a large number of phonetic newspapers and periodicals without being restricted by the number of characters they know, and constantly increase the number of characters they know through self-study. It is also necessary for those students who have not learned pinyin letters and have already graduated from literacy and entered spare-time primary schools to learn pinyin letters so that they can use pinyin as a tool in spare-time primary schools to consolidate their learning achievements and speed up their learning progress. The Chinese language course, which originally took two years to complete, can now be completed in less than half a year, which greatly shortens the learning years of spare-time higher primary schools.

The experience of various regions proves that the superiority of phonetic literacy is very significant. The first is to eliminate the phenomenon of a large number of relapses after literacy, which solves a major problem in literacy work, that is, the problem of consolidation after literacy. The second is to accelerate the speed of literacy and spare-time education, and it has been proven possible to shorten the time from literacy to graduation from spare-time higher primary school (including Chinese and arithmetic) to one year. The third is to solve the problem of early reading and early writing. Although literacy students do not know many characters, they can rely on pinyin to repel the "roadblocks" in reading and bypass the "stumbling blocks" in writing, and carry out a large amount of reading and writing. This greatly improves the confidence and interest of the masses in reading and writing. Through a lot of reading, they can not only consolidate the Chinese characters they have learned, but also increase the number of new characters they have not learned, and also acquire various knowledge and improve their political, cultural, and technical level. Fourth, it is convenient for workers and peasants to use their labor gaps for decentralized self-study, which can minimize the use of labor and is conducive to production. Fifth, the masses' mastery of pinyin letters creates extremely favorable conditions for the promotion of Mandarin. In short, phonetic literacy is an important teaching reform in literacy and spare-time education, opening up a shortcut for the intellectualization of workers and peasants, and therefore a great good thing. There is no longer any doubt about this.

The central instructions pointed out: "Eliminating illiteracy among young and middle-aged people ahead of schedule is one of the important keys to realizing the forty articles of the Agricultural Program ahead of schedule. Therefore, promoting Wanrong County's experience in eliminating illiteracy more, faster, better, and more economically is an important task." Now the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to universally promote the experience of Wanrong County throughout the province, and has made plans to strive to eliminate illiteracy among young and middle-aged people in the province greatly ahead of schedule. Shandong, Hebei, and Jilin have also successively convened provincial on-site meetings on phonetic literacy, and have respectively decided to fully launch it in the province in June, July, and October this year. The vast majority of provinces and regions in the country belong to the Mandarin-speaking area, and can and should universally promote this experience and strive to complete the literacy task ahead of schedule. In Fujian, Zhejiang and other provinces, they are also experimenting with the method of phonetic literacy to eliminate illiteracy, while promoting Mandarin. In short, in areas where pilot projects have already been carried out, the relevant provincial and municipal party committees should strengthen leadership, actively carry out pilot projects, quickly figure out experience, and then vigorously promote them. Areas that have not yet started the experiment should seize the opportunity to carry out pilot projects and train teachers before the autumn of this year, and promote them on a large scale after the autumn.

In order to do a good job in phonetic literacy, party committees at all levels must strengthen leadership, fully mobilize people ideologically, closely integrate with production, and vigorously launch mass movements. This is the common basic experience of Wanrong County and other places in doing a good job in phonetic literacy. Phonetic literacy is a new task, and cadres and the masses will have various doubts and concerns, which is very natural. Therefore, it is necessary to repeatedly publicize and do ideological work to enable cadres, teachers, and the masses to have a correct understanding of phonetic literacy. This is the primary key to carrying out the phonetic literacy movement. In particular, it is necessary to clearly explain the purpose of teaching pinyin letters.

Pinyin letters are a tool for literacy, and they are not an end in themselves. We require the masses to skillfully master initials, finals, spelling, and syllables, for the purpose of helping literacy and speeding up literacy. Pinyin letters are also a tool for learning Mandarin, but in the northern dialect area, the main task of the phonetic literacy stage is literacy. Correcting local accents and learning Mandarin should be done according to the specific situation of the local area, lowering the requirements, that is, consciously postponing this task to an appropriate time after literacy, so as not to affect the progress of literacy. As for promoting Mandarin among workers and peasants in dialect areas, it must also be combined with learning culture, that is, the masses must learn pinyin letters and read phonetic readings in order for Mandarin to be consolidated and improved.

Grasping the training of teachers is another key to carrying out the phonetic literacy movement. The experience of Shanxi Province in training teachers is: the province, county, commune, and management district are responsible for dividing the work and training at all levels (the province and county train key personnel, the commune trains civilian teachers, the management district trains instructors), each commune establishes a teaching station, each district establishes a teaching and research group, primary school teachers are responsible for teaching mass teachers, students are responsible for teaching students, activists act as "little teachers", and full-time teachers and part-time teachers are closely combined, learning and teaching at the same time, teaching and learning at the same time, everyone is a teacher, everyone is a student. This will form a mighty momentum of "ten thousand people teaching, the whole people learning."

Supplying teaching materials and phonetic readings is the third important key to carrying out the phonetic literacy movement. Whether the results of literacy can be consolidated and expanded depends to a large extent on the supply of phonetic readings, so this is a very urgent issue. In order to ensure sufficient supply and closely integrate with the different needs of various regions, this work must be done by all regions together. The publishing departments of various regions should conscientiously do a good job in the publication and distribution of teaching materials and phonetic readings, and regard it as one of the most important tasks at present. Popular readings, children's readings, and comic strip text descriptions published by central and local publishing houses should be as far as possible annotated with pinyin character by character. Some of the longer texts can use difficult character annotations, that is, only add pinyin next to uncommon characters and characters that are easy to misread. Popular newspapers and periodicals aimed at workers, peasants, teenagers, and children should gradually adopt difficult character annotations uniformly to facilitate readers. In view of the rapid development of the phonetic literacy movement and the large number of phonetic readings required, various regions must pay attention to implementing both indigenous and foreign methods when compiling and printing a large number of teaching materials and readings, that is, they must try their best to mobilize the masses to use various methods such as copying, mimeographing, and lithography, and must establish and enrich libraries, reading rooms, and book stations, try their best to do a good job in borrowing, and do a good job in organizing reading groups, advocating collective book purchases, etc., and try to make each phonetic newspaper and book play as large a role as possible. Counties and communes should also take materials locally as much as possible and use indigenous methods to make paper to meet the needs of teaching materials and phonetic readings.

With the development of the phonetic literacy movement, Mandarin must be vigorously promoted. Children, students, young teachers, young workers, young farmers, young shop assistants, and young officers and soldiers in the army should become pioneers in promoting Mandarin, creating a good atmosphere of learning Mandarin and speaking Mandarin among all strata of the people and in all departments of work throughout the country.

The central instructions pointed out that in order to accelerate literacy and reduce the learning burden of children, the existing Chinese characters must continue to be simplified. Since the implementation of the Chinese character simplification plan, it has been very popular among the masses, especially benefiting children and adults who are just learning to write. However, there are still many relatively commonly used characters that are difficult to write, recognize, or remember, and are easy to write, recognize, or remember incorrectly. These characters must be gradually simplified further, and the Chinese characters should be made as simple and clear as possible. Among the place names, there is a group of rare and difficult-to-recognize characters that most people other than the locals cannot read or often misread. These characters have no other use except as place names, and they only increase the learning burden. Many places have simplified these characters (generally using common characters with the same pronunciation to replace them), and places that have not been simplified should also quickly solve this problem. The further simplification of Chinese characters is a task that must rely on the broad masses, who are very enthusiastic and have ways to do it. The existing simplified characters were originally the result of the creation and use of the broad masses. Now the masses in various places have successively created and used a large number of new simplified characters, which proves that the continued simplification of Chinese characters is the general trend and the will of the people, and can only be guided by the situation and rationalized to avoid confusion, and cannot be prevented. In order to carry out this work, the cultural and educational departments of various provinces and cities should immediately start organizing primary and secondary school teachers, mass teachers, education work and publishing staff to hold discussions, explain the great significance of simplifying Chinese characters, fully mobilize the masses, collect a batch of characters that are difficult to recognize, write, remember, and easy to recognize, write, and remember incorrectly as much as possible, study and collect simplification and processing methods, and then propose a batch of new simplified characters recommendations, report to the Central Chinese Character Reform Committee for comprehensive consolidation and then submit to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council for approval. This is also a very important task.

We believe that vigorously implementing this instruction of the Central Committee, vigorously promoting Wanrong County's experience in phonetic literacy, and further simplifying and sorting out Chinese characters will greatly promote and accelerate the completion of the literacy task and the development of spare-time education.

    大力推广注音识字  争取提前扫除文盲
    中共中央今天发布了关于推广注音识字的指示，指示指出，山西省万荣县注音识字的经验是我国文化革命中一项很重要的创造，号召全国迅速推广这个经验，力争提前扫除文盲。
    山西省万荣县利用拼音字母，在加快扫盲速度、巩固扩大扫盲成果方面取得的优异成绩，这在中共山西省委给中央的报告中说得很清楚，本报过去也曾作过一些报道。目前，在山西、山东、吉林、河北、安徽、四川、湖北、辽宁、北京等省市，一个学万荣、赶万荣的注音识字运动正在蓬勃开展。
    各地的经验继续证明：注音识字是多快好省地扫除文盲、巩固和扩大扫盲成果的好方法；凡是开展注音识字的地区，群众的学习信心受到很大鼓舞，参加学习的人数迅速增长。山西省已经掀起全民学习拼音字母的热潮，参加学习的人数，包括学生和幼儿在内，已接近全省人口的40％。晋南专区的学习人数已经达到二百零五万，超过全区青壮年总人数的80％。山东省参加注音识字的扫盲班和业余学校的学员已达四百五十五万人。这些数字还在不断增长。
    根据各地的经验，文盲和半文盲一般经过二十到三十小时的教学，就可以学会拼音方案；再经过一百几十小时的阅读和写作教学，就可以认识一千五百个字，达到扫盲毕业标准。群众掌握了拼音工具、认识一千多个汉字之后，就可以不受识字数量的限制，无师自通地大量阅读注音书报，并在自学中不断增加识字数量。那些未学拼音字母，已经脱盲进入业余小学学习的学员，也有必要学习拼音字母，以便在业余小学利用拼音这个工具，巩固学习成绩，加快学习进度，原来一般需要两年才能学完的语文课程，现在不到半年就可以学完，这就大大缩短了业余高小的学习年限。
    各地的经验证明：注音识字的优越性，是十分显著的。第一是消灭了扫盲过后大量回生的现象，这就解决了扫盲工作中的一个大问题，即脱盲之后的巩固问题。第二是加快了扫盲和业余教育的速度，把从扫盲到业余高小毕业（包括语文和算术）的时间缩短到一年，已经证明是可能的。第三是解决了早期阅读和早期写作问题。脱盲学员尽管识字不多，但是依靠拼音就可以打退阅读中的“拦路虎”，绕过写作上的“绊脚石”，而进行大量阅读和大量写作。这就大大提高了群众阅读和写作的信心和兴趣。通过大量阅读，不仅可以巩固已经学过的汉字，增识尚未学过的生字，还能获得各种知识，提高政治文化技术水平。第四，便于工农群众利用劳动间隙分散自学，这样就可以尽量减少使用劳动力，有利于生产。第五，群众掌握了拼音字母，就为推广普通话创造了极为有利的条件。总之，注音识字是扫盲和业余教育中的重要的教学改革，为工农群众的知识化开辟了捷径，因此是一件了不起的好事。这一点已经没有什么可以怀疑的了。
    中央指示指出：“提前扫除青壮年文盲是提前实现农业纲要四十条的重要关键之一，因此，推广万荣县的多快好省的扫盲经验是一项重要任务。”现在中共山西省委已经决定在全省普遍推广万荣县的经验，并且作出规划，争取大大提前扫除全省青壮年文盲。山东、河北、吉林也已相继召开全省注音识字现场会议，并且分别决定在今年6月、7月、10月在全省范围全面铺开。全国绝大多数省区属于普通话区，都可以而且应当普遍推广这个经验，力争提前完成扫盲任务。在福建、浙江等省，也在试行用注音识字的办法扫除文盲，同时推广普通话。总之，目前已经进行试点的地区，各有关省市区党委应该加强领导，积极做好试点，迅速摸出经验，然后大力推广。尚未着手试验的地区，应该抓紧时机，在今年秋前试点和培训师资，在秋后大规模地推广。
    为了做好注音识字工作，各级党委必须加强领导，充分做好思想发动，密切结合生产，大搞群众运动。这是万荣县以及其他各地搞好注音识字工作的共同的基本经验。注音识字是一项新的工作，干部和群众都会有各种怀疑和顾虑，这是很自然的。因此必须反复宣传，做好思想工作，使干部、教师、群众对注音识字有正确的认识。这是开展注音识字运动的首要关键。特别需要把教学拼音字母的目的性交代清楚。
    拼音字母是识字的工具，它本身并非目的。我们要求群众熟练掌握声母、韵母、拼法和音节，目的在于用来帮助识字，加快识字的速度。拼音字母也是学习普通话的工具，但是在北方话区，注音扫盲阶段的主要任务是识字，对于纠正方音、学习普通话应该根据当地具体情况，降低要求，即把这项任务有意识地推迟到脱盲以后的适当时机去完成，以免影响扫盲进度。至于在方言区的工农群众中推广普通话，也必须与学习文化相结合，即必须使群众学会拼音字母和阅读注音读物，普通话才能得到巩固和提高。
    抓好师资的训练工作，是开展注音识字运动的又一个关键。山西省训练师资的经验是：省、县、公社、管理区分工负责，层层训练（省县训练骨干，公社训练民师，管理区训练辅导员），社社成立传授站，区区成立教研组，小学教师包教群众教师，学生包教学员，积极分子当“小先生”，专职教师和业余教师紧密结合，边教边学，边学边教，人人是先生，人人是学生。这样就能形成一个“万人教、全民学”的浩大声势。
    供应教材和注音读物是开展注音识字运动的第三个重要关键。扫盲成果的能否巩固和扩大，在很大程度上决定于注音读物的供应，因此这是一个十分紧迫的问题。为了保证充分供应，并且密切结合各个地区的不同需要，这项工作必须由各个地区一齐动手。各地的出版部门应该认真做好教材和注音读物的出版发行工作，把它作为当前的一项最重要的任务。中央和地方出版社出版的通俗读物、少年儿童读物、连环图画的文字说明，应该尽量做到逐字注音，其中一部分字数较多的，可以采用难字注音，即仅在非常用字以及容易读错的字旁加注拼音。以工农群众和青少年儿童为对象的通俗报纸和期刊，应该逐步做到一律采用难字注音，以便利读者。鉴于注音识字运动发展很快，需要的注音读物为数很大，因此各地在大量编印教材读物的时候，必须注意实行土洋并举，即要尽量发动群众利用抄写、油印、石印等各种办法，并且要建立和充实图书馆、图书室、图书站，尽量做好借阅工作，以及做好组织读书小组、提倡集体购书等等工作，尽量使每一份注音书报发挥尽可能大的作用。县和公社还要尽可能就地取材，用土法造纸，满足教材和注音读物用纸的需要。
    随着注音识字运动的开展，普通话必须大力提倡推广。儿童、学生、青年教师、青年工人、青年农民、青年店员、部队中的青年官兵，应该成为推广普通话的急先锋，在全国各阶层群众中和各部门工作中造成学普通话、说普通话的优良风气。
    中央指示指出，为了加速扫盲和减轻儿童学习负担，现有的汉字还必须继续简化。汉字简化方案推行以来，特别使初学文字的儿童和成人得到许多便利，因此很受群众欢迎。但是现在还有很多比较常用的字难写或者难认难记，容易写错认错记错，这些字必须逐步继续简化，并且使汉字尽可能有简单、明显的规律。地名用字中，有一批生僻难认的字，除当地人以外多数人读不出来或者常常要读错，这些字除作地名以外，别无用处，徒然增加学习负担。许多地方已经把这些字简化了（一般是用同音的常用字代替），没有简化的地方也应当迅速解决这个问题。进一步简化汉字，这一任务必须依靠广大群众，广大群众对此是十分热心和有办法的。已有的简字本来就是广大群众创造和使用的结果。现在各地群众又已经陆续创造和使用大批新的简字，这证明汉字的继续简化是大势所趋，人心所向，只能因势利导，加以合理化，避免混乱现象，而无法加以阻止。为了进行这个工作，各省市区的文教部门应即着手组织中小学教师，群众教师，教育工作和出版工作人员进行座谈，说明简化汉字的重大意义，充分发动群众，尽量搜集一批难认难写难记和容易认错写错记错的字，研究征集简化和处理方法，然后提出一批新简化字的建议，报告中央文字改革委员会综合整理后送中共中央和国务院审定。这也是一件十分重要的工作。
    我们相信，大力贯彻执行中央的这个指示，大力推广万荣县的注音识字经验，进一步简化和整理汉字，将大大促进和加快扫盲任务的完成和业余教育的发展。
