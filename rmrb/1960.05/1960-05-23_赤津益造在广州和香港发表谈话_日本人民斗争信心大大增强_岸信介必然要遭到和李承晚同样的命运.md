Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, May 22nd: The delegation from the Japan-China Friendship Association led by Akazu Masuzo, along with the Japanese journalist Ito Takeo and others, left Guangzhou by train this morning via Hong Kong to return to their country.

Du Guoxiang, President of the Guangzhou Branch of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and Vice President Feng Naichao held a banquet last night to bid farewell to the Japanese guests. Du Guoxiang spoke at the beginning of the banquet. He said: The Japanese militarist forces, headed by Kishi Nobusuke, under the direction of US imperialism, used violence to force the illegal passage of the aggressive Japan-US military alliance treaty through the House of Representatives of the Diet. This is a manifestation of the desperation and death throes of the US-Japan reactionaries. We firmly believe that in the struggle against the most ferocious enemies—the US-Japan reactionaries—the Japanese people will further temper themselves, raise their awareness, and strengthen their unity.

Du Guoxiang said: The Chinese people have always regarded the Japanese people's struggle against the US-Japan reactionaries as a common struggle of our two peoples. We believe that with the heroic struggle of the Japanese people and the firm support of all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world, the Japanese people will surely achieve final victory.

Akazu Masuzo, head of the delegation, said at the banquet: During its visit to China, the delegation of the Japan-China Friendship Association met Chairman Mao in Wuhan and participated in grand rallies in various places to support the Japanese people's opposition to the Japan-US military alliance treaty. We personally witnessed the Chinese people's great support and deep sympathy for the Japanese people's struggle. This made us realize even more deeply that the Japanese people's struggle is not isolated. The Chinese people, the people of Asia, and the people of all countries in the world stand with us. This greatly encouraged us and strengthened the Japanese people's confidence in struggle.

Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, May 22nd: Akazu Masuzo, head of the delegation of the Japan-China Friendship Association, told Hong Kong journalists today that the Kishi Nobusuke government's despicable and barbaric act of forcibly passing the Japan-US military alliance treaty in the House of Representatives through fascist means "was directed by US imperialism and Japanese monopoly capital groups, but the Japanese people and all peace-loving people in the world will definitely fight it resolutely."

Akazu Masuzo pointed out that the Japanese people today are no longer like they were in the days of Hideki Tojo. Therefore, Kishi Nobusuke's attempt to re-implement a policy of aggression against China and Asia will inevitably be met with increasing opposition from the people. He warned that "The Syngman Rhee ruling clique in South Korea has been overthrown by the people for adopting high-handed and dictatorial means. Kishi Nobusuke's fate will inevitably be the same."

The delegation of the Japan-China Friendship Association, consisting of twenty-one people led by Akazu Masuzo, arrived in Hong Kong from Guangzhou today en route to Japan. When interviewed by reporters, he said: The Chinese people held demonstrations and rallies in various places to support the Japanese people's opposition to the Japan-US military alliance treaty, expressing their immense anger at the revival of Japanese militarism and the collusion between the US-Japan reactionaries in plotting war conspiracies. He pointed out that the great achievements made by the Chinese people in socialist construction are a powerful force in preventing US imperialism from launching wars and Kishi Nobusuke's aggressive conspiracies, and at the same time, they have encouraged the Japanese people's just struggle.

Akazu Masuzo said: Both the Chinese and Japanese people long for peace and friendship. The people of this era hope for world peace, and whoever wants to go the opposite way will inevitably be destroyed and abandoned by history.

In his speech, Akazu Masuzo also expressed his support for Khrushchev's solemn stance on the Four-Power Summit and condemned the US for undermining the Four-Power Summit and evading responsibility for aggression as a robber. He said: "The US's adoption of this false peace attitude means that the summit is bound to be fruitless."

The delegation of the Japan-China Friendship Association will leave Hong Kong tomorrow to return to Japan.

    赤津益造在广州和香港发表谈话
    日本人民斗争信心大大增强
    岸信介必然要遭到和李承晚同样的命运
    新华社广州22日电　以赤津益造为首的日本日中友好协会访华代表团和日本新闻工作者伊藤武雄等人，今天上午乘火车离开广州取道香港回国。
    中国人民对外文化协会广州分会会长杜国庠、副会长冯乃超昨晚举行宴会，欢送日本客人。杜国庠在宴会开始时讲话。他说：以岸信介为首的日本军国主义势力，在美帝国主义指使下，用暴力强迫国会众议院非法通过了侵略性的日美军事同盟条约。这是美日反动派日暮途穷、垂死挣扎的表现。我们深深地相信，日本人民在同最凶恶的敌人——美日反动派的斗争中，将进一步锻炼自己，提高觉悟，加强团结。
    杜国庠说：中国人民一向把日本人民反对美日反动派的斗争，看成是我们两国人民的共同斗争。相信在日本人民的英勇斗争下，在全世界各个爱好和平的国家和人民的坚决支持下，日本人民一定会获得最后的胜利。
    代表团团长赤津益造在宴会上说：日中友协访华代表团在访问中国期间，在武汉会见了毛主席，参加了各地人民支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的盛大集会，亲眼看到中国人民对日本人民斗争的巨大支持和深切同情。这使我们更深刻体会到，日本人民的斗争不是孤立的，中国人民、亚洲和世界各国人民都和我们站在一起，这大大鼓舞了我们，增强了日本人民斗争的信心。
    新华社香港22日电　日本中国友好协会访华代表团团长赤津益造今天对香港新闻记者发表谈话说，岸信介政府采取法西斯手段在众议院强行通过日美军事同盟条约的卑鄙野蛮行为，“是由美帝国主义和日本垄断资本集团所指使的，但是日本人民和全世界爱好和平的人民一定坚决和它作斗争。”
    赤津益造指出，今天的日本人民再不像以前东条英机时代那样了，因此岸信介要重新执行侵略中国和亚洲的政策，必然受到人民越来越多的反对。他警告说，“南朝鲜李承晚统治集团采取高压独裁的手段，已经给人民打垮了，岸信介的命运，也必然如此。”
    日中友好协会代表团一行二十一人在赤津益造率领下，今天从广州抵达香港转道回日本。他在接见记者时说：这次中国人民在各地举行了支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的示威游行和集会，表示了对日本军国主义的复活和美日反动派勾结策划战争阴谋的无比愤怒。他指出，中国人民在社会主义建设中所取得的伟大成就，是阻止美帝国主义发动战争和岸信介的侵略阴谋的强大力量，同时也鼓舞了日本人民的正义斗争。
    赤津益造说：中国人民和日本人民都渴望和平和友谊。现在这个时代的人民希望世界和平，谁要走相反的道路，必然遭受灭亡，为历史所抛弃。
    赤津益造在谈话中还表示支持赫鲁晓夫对四国首脑会议的严正立场，同时谴责美国破坏四国首脑会议、逃避侵略责任的强盗行径。他说：“美国采取这种假和平的态度，举行首脑会议必然是毫无结果的。”
    日本中国友好协会访华代表团将在明天离开香港返回日本。
