Xinhua News Agency, 4th Dispatch. A dispatch from our correspondent: Awakened Turkish young students, regardless of the extremely savage suppression by the Menderes government supported by American bayonets, have launched a vigorous and large-scale demonstration struggle that has persisted for a week, writing a new and glorious page in the history of the Turkish people's national democratic movement.

Istanbul is the largest city in Turkey and is considered by the United States and the Menderes government to be one of their most "reliable" cities. They arranged for the North Atlantic aggressive group's council meeting to be held there. In order to hold this meeting, the Menderes government also maintained tight security there. But the Turkish young students, who could no longer tolerate it, held a demonstration on the eve of the meeting that planned new conspiracies, and even went to demonstrate in front of the meeting venue.

This struggle was first launched on April 28th by tens of thousands of Istanbul students. They issued angry roars demanding the Menderes government to step down. Immediately afterwards, students in the capital Ankara and the western stronghold of Izmir responded. Despite the authorities dispatching American-made tanks and American-equipped troops to brutally suppress them and enforce a 24-hour curfew, the demonstrations continued one after another, and they continued to unyieldingly persist in their struggle.

Under the dark rule of the traitorous Menderes government, patriotic Turkish young students were filled with indignation as they watched their beautiful country become a semi-colony trampled by American iron heels, and the people were plunged into misery. What lay before them was only the threat of dropping out of school, unemployment, poverty, disease, and prison. Due to the Menderes government's implementation of the US imperialist policy of arms expansion and war preparation, Turkey's military expenditures continued to increase, and the budget allocated for culture and education was decreasing day by day. There were too few schools, and tuition fees were expensive, so the number of Turkish teenagers dropping out of school was increasing. Only about 1% can receive higher education. And those who have the opportunity to go to school, even if they endure until graduation, cannot find job opportunities.

In order to suppress students' dissatisfaction and resistance actions, Menderes adopted high-pressure measures against students. Hundreds of progressive students were thrown into prison and subjected to severe interrogations. Some youth cultural organizations established before Menderes came to power were all disbanded under the charge of being "centers of extreme left-wing activities." Criticism of the government, even if it was extremely mild, was strictly prohibited. The university authorities also stipulated that students who have been imprisoned cannot study at any university or study abroad.

The Menderes government did not hesitate to sacrifice young students in order to betray the country and seek glory. Approximately one in ten Turkish youths are conscripted to serve as cannon fodder for US imperialism, including cannon fodder in the Korean War.

Turkish social youth also live a life of darkness. Young workers work 12 to 14 hours a day, with no paid holidays, no health protection equipment in factories, and lung diseases and other illnesses are common. They are also deprived of basic political rights, cannot engage in trade union activities, and must vote according to the employer's wishes when electing members of parliament.

Therefore, for ten years, Turkish young students have been struggling in various ways to win national independence, democratic freedom, and the right to life. In September 1958, 1,800 students from Istanbul University took public demonstration actions to protest the deteriorating living conditions. Their slogans read: "We have no money to buy stationery," "We don't eat well," "We have no place to sleep," "No one cares about our demands."

This time, because the Menderes government intensified its further deprivation of the people's political rights and brazenly banned political activities for three months, Turkish young students felt even more unbearable, so like a volcanic eruption, the anger accumulated in their hearts for ten years immediately burned fiercely. These angers of Turkish young students will also ignite larger-scale fires in Turkey, and finally burn the criminal tools of US imperialism that enslave the Turkish people to ashes.

American "Newsweek" reveals Washington's concerns about student movements breaking out in South Vietnam and Taiwan
Xinhua News Agency, 4th Dispatch. New York News: The American "Newsweek," in its issue of May 9th, which was published ahead of schedule, wrote worriedly that "Washington fears that the student riots that overthrew Syngman Rhee in (South) Korea and are now threatening Menderes in Turkey may spread to places like South Vietnam and Formosa (referring to Taiwan)."

This weekly magazine admitted that the "diplomatic experts" in the United States believe that the people in these places "have real dissatisfaction" with the regimes supported by the United States. It also predicted that "the United States will order (its) overseas officials to pay closer attention to the policies of countries receiving American aid," that is, to tighten control over these puppet regimes.

    不能容忍祖国受美国铁蹄蹂躏
    土耳其青年学生高举斗争火炬
    新华社4日讯　本社记者报道：觉醒了的土耳其青年学生，不顾美国刺刀支持下的曼德列斯政府极端野蛮的镇压，最近掀起的轰轰烈烈的大规模示威斗争已经坚持了一星期，为土耳其人民的民族民主运动历史写下了新的光辉一页。
    伊斯坦布尔是土耳其最大的城市，也是美国和曼德列斯政府认为是他们统治得最“可靠”的城市之一，他们把北大西洋侵略集团理事会会议安排在那里举行。为了举行这次会议，曼德列斯政府还在那里森严戒备。但是忍无可忍的土耳其青年学生就在那个策划新阴谋的会议前夕，举行了示威，而且还特别走到那个会场前面示威。
    这次斗争是成万伊斯坦布尔学生在4月28日首先发起的。他们发出了要求曼德列斯政府下台的怒吼。接着，首都安卡拉和西部重镇伊兹密尔的学生立即群起响应。尽管当局出动美制坦克和美式配备的军队残暴镇压，并实行二十四小时戒严，但示威还是此伏彼起，他们继续不屈不挠地坚持他们的斗争。
    在曼德列斯卖国政府的黑暗统治之下，爱国的土耳其青年学生眼看着大好江山沦为美国铁蹄蹂躏下的半殖民地，人民陷于水深火热之中，不能不愤懑填膺。摆在他们面前的，也只是失学、失业、贫困、疾病、监狱的威胁。由于曼德列斯政府执行美帝国主义的扩军备战政策，土耳其的军事费用不断增加，预算中用于文化教育的拨款日益削减，学校太少，同时学费又昂贵，因而土耳其青少年失学者日众。能受到高等教育的只有约1％。而那些有机会进学校的，纵然熬到了毕业，也找不到工作的机会。
    为了压制学生的不满情绪和反抗行动，曼德列斯对学生采取了高压措施。成百的进步学生被投入监狱，遭受严刑审讯。一些在曼德列斯执政前成立的青年文化组织，在“极端左翼的活动中心”的罪名下被全部解散。对政府的批评即使是极其温和的也在严禁之列。大学当局还规定，凡是受过监禁的学生就不能在任何大学学习，也不能出国学习。
    曼德列斯政府为了卖国求荣，不惜以青年学生为牺牲品。大约每十个土耳其青年中就有一个被征去充当美帝国主义的炮灰，其中包括侵朝战争的炮灰。
    土耳其社会青年也过着暗无天日的生活。青年工人每日工作十二至十四小时，没有工资照付的假期，工厂里没有保护健康的设备，肺病和其他疾病普遍。他们还被剥夺了基本政治权利，不能从事工会活动，而且在选举议员时必须完全要照雇主的意旨投票。
    因此，十年来，土耳其青年学生一直以各种方式进行着争取民族独立、民主自由和生活权利的斗争。1958年9月，伊斯坦布尔大学的一千八百名学生曾经采取公开示威行动，抗议生活条件的日益恶化。他们的标语上写着：“我们没有钱买文具”、“我们吃得不好”、“我们没有地方睡觉”、“谁也不关心我们的要求”。
    这一次，由于曼德列斯政府变本加厉地进一步剥夺人民的政治权利，悍然禁止政治活动三个月，土耳其青年学生更是感到忍无可忍，于是像火山爆发一样，十年来蕴积在心中的怒火立即炽烈地燃烧起来。土耳其青年学生的这些怒火，还将在土耳其点燃起更大规模的烈火，最后把美帝国主义奴役土耳其人民的罪恶工具烧个干干净净。美国“新闻周刊”透露华盛顿担心南越和台湾爆发学生运动
    新华社4日讯　纽约消息：提前出版的5月9日一期的美国“新闻周刊”担心地写道，“华盛顿害怕那种推翻了（南）朝鲜的李承晚而现在威胁着土耳其的曼德列斯的学生骚动可能扩大到南越和福摩萨（指台湾）这样一些地方”。
    这家周刊承认，美国的“外交专家们”都认为这些地方的人民对美国支持的政权“有着真正的不满”。它还预测，“美国将命令（它的）驻海外官员更密切地注视接受美国帮助的国家的政策”，也就是说要加紧对这些傀儡政权的控制。
