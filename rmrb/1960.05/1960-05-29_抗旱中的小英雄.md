    Little Heroes in the Fight Against Drought
    In the vigorous movement to fight drought and protect the harvest, thousands of Young Pioneers in Daming County, together with their elders, have plunged into the great struggle against drought. In early May, more than two thousand Young Pioneers from forty-three primary schools in the Chengguan Commune of Daming County left their schools and joined the ranks of the peasant uncles and aunts in fighting the drought. Zhang Fusheng, a thirteen-year-old Young Pioneer squad leader, carried his luggage and led more than eighty classmates to the Nanguan Production Team to water the wheat. The members of the team hurriedly started to arrange for their accommodation and classes in the village, but were refused by the Young Pioneers. Liu Dazhu, eleven years old, said: Let's sleep by the well at night, so as not to waste time going back and forth, isn't it good to have classes in the fields during breaks? The battle began, with eight pupils assigned to one water cart, and a "Five-Good" competition was launched. They also came up with the idea of ​​converging several water carts into one ridge ditch to water the fields, which improved the efficiency of watering. The team members watered two and a half mu per water cart per day, while they watered more than three mu per day. The masses reflected: "The Party and Chairman Mao have educated the children so well, they can study and produce, they are truly versatile, and they will surely have a promising future when they grow up."

    抗旱中的小英雄
    在轰轰烈烈的抗旱保丰收运动中，大名县成千上万的红领巾都同长辈们一起，投入了伟大的抗旱斗争。5月上旬的一天，大名县城关公社四十三个小学的两千多名红领巾，离开了学校，加入了农民叔叔伯伯们的抗旱行列。十三岁的少先队中队长张福生扛着行李，带着八十多名小同学赴南关生产队浇麦。这里的社员们急忙动手想把他们的住宿、上课安排到村里去，但却遭到了红领巾们的拒绝，十一岁的刘大柱说：晚上咱就睡在井边，省得来回耽误事，休息时在田间上课不是很好吗？战斗开始了，八个小同学包一辆水车，还开展了五好竞赛运动。他们还想出了几辆水车汇一个垅沟浇地，提高了浇地效率，社员们一辆水车日浇二亩半，他们日浇三亩多。群众反映说：“党和毛主席把孩子教育的真好，会学习、会生产，真是文武双全，长大了一定有出息。”
