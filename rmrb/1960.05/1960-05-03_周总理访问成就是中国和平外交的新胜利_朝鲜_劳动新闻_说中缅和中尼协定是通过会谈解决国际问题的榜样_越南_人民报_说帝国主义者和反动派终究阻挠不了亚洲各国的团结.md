Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 2nd. "Rodong Sinmun" today published an editorial welcoming the achievements of Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Burma, India, and Nepal. The editorial said that the entire process of the visit more clearly demonstrated the consistent peaceful foreign policy pursued by the People's Republic of China since its founding, and also proved that China, as a reliable friend of the Asian people, enjoys great trust and respect.

The editorial said that since the founding of the People's Republic of China, it has made efforts and achieved great successes in consolidating peace in Asia and developing friendly relations among the people of this region, based on the principle of peaceful coexistence with countries with different social systems. China, based on its common stance against imperialism and colonialism, has been and is supporting and assisting the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America in their struggles for national liberation and independence. China has provided selfless assistance to newly independent countries, helping them develop their national economies.

The editorial said that China has always advocated resolving all outstanding international issues through peaceful negotiations. The agreements between China and Burma and China and Nepal on border issues are examples of this. The editorial continued, stating that without a doubt, if the Indian side, in future talks, treats the outstanding border issue between China and India with the same sincerity as China, then this issue can be satisfactorily resolved. The editorial said that Premier Zhou Enlai's visit further enhanced the prestige of the People's Republic of China as a peace-loving country. "Rodong Sinmun" also pointed out that the results of Premier Zhou's visit once again confirmed that the conspiracies of U.S. imperialism and its followers to slander and defame the People's Republic of China and attempt to undermine its prestige are futile.

The editorial pointed out that today, one of the conspiracies carried out by Western imperialists, headed by U.S. imperialism, to restore their lost colonial territories in Asia is to sow discord between the great People's Republic of China and other peace-loving countries in Asia, create disharmony among them, and frantically launch an "anti-China movement." U.S. imperialism also mobilized its kept newspapers and all propaganda machines during Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Burma, India, and Nepal, conspiring to denigrate and belittle the significance of the visit. The imperialist propaganda organs even clamored that China must give up its inherent territory as a prerequisite for Sino-Indian consultations, and also said that the Sino-Indian border issue cannot be resolved not only now, but even after several generations. The editorial said, however, that Premier Zhou Enlai's visit proved that, apart from a very small number of right-wing elements in India, the broad masses of the Indian people cherish the traditional friendship between China and India.

The editorial said that the imperialists now regard the People's Republic of China as a thorn in their side and hate it to the core, because China was once their territory for aggression and plunder, but now the People's Republic of China, as a great socialist power, stands like Mount Tai in Asia, becoming a banner to inspire the national liberation struggles of the Asian people, and a strong fortress for Asian peace, thus causing U.S. imperialism to feel extreme unease and terror in the face of the powerful strength of the People's Republic of China.

The editorial said that the U.S. imperialist "anti-China movement" once again nakedly exposed its cunning nature of splitting the Asian people, creating mutual attacks, and attempting to profit from it. The editorial continued, stating that Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Burma, India, and Nepal dealt a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism, which attempts to weaken the forces of peace and conspires to achieve its aggressive goals.

The editorial said that today, the Asian people clearly know through life experience the great significance of the existence of the great People's Republic of China to their struggle for national freedom and independence.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 1st. The Vietnamese "Nhan Dan" (People's Daily) today published a commentary warmly congratulating the achievements of Premier Zhou Enlai's visit abroad.

The commentary pointed out that Premier Zhou Enlai's visit was for peace and friendship. The commentary said, "The achievements of Premier Zhou Enlai's visit mark a new victory for China's consistent pursuit of a policy of peace and friendship. This policy has been warmly welcomed by the people of Burma, India, and Nepal."

The commentary said, "The achievements of Premier Zhou Enlai's visit have made a positive contribution to the unity of Asian countries, and it eloquently proves the vitality of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Spirit."

The commentary said, "Imperialism and all reactionaries are desperately undermining China's efforts to strengthen friendly relations with Burma, India, and Nepal. However, they will ultimately be unable to obstruct the ever-strengthening unity of Asian countries."

The commentary concluded, "While excitedly awaiting Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to our country, our people warmly welcome the good achievements made by Premier Zhou Enlai's visit for peace and friendship. We are willing to work unremittingly with the Chinese people and the people of other Asian countries to strengthen and consolidate Asian-African unity and safeguard Asian and world peace."

    周总理访问成就是中国和平外交的新胜利
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”说中缅和中尼协定是通过会谈解决国际问题的榜样
    越南“人民报”说帝国主义者和反动派终究阻挠不了亚洲各国的团结
    新华社平壤2日电　朝鲜“劳动新闻”今天发表社论，欢迎周恩来总理访问缅甸、印度、尼泊尔的成就。社论说，访问的整个过程更加清楚地显示了中华人民共和国成立以来始终一贯坚持的和平对外政策，也证明了中国作为亚洲人民的可靠的朋友，得到很大的信赖和尊敬。
    社论说，中华人民共和国建国以来，根据同不同社会制度国家和平共处的原则，为了巩固亚洲的和平和发展这个地区人民之间的友好关系，作了努力并取得了巨大成就。中国从反对帝国主义和殖民主义的共同立场出发，已经和正在支援和声援争取民族解放和独立的亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的人民。中国对新生的独立国家给予了无私的援助，帮助这些国家发展民族经济。
    社论说，中国一贯主张以和平会谈的方法解决一切国际上悬而未决的问题。中缅、中尼间的关于边界问题的协定就是其中的榜样。社论接着说，毫无疑问，如果印度方面在今后继续的会谈中，也像中国一样真诚的对待悬而未决的中印两国的边界问题，那就可以圆满地解决这个问题。社论说，周恩来总理这次访问进一步提高了作为爱好和平国家的中华人民共和国的威信。“劳动新闻”还指出，周总理这一次访问的结果又一次证实了，美帝国主义和它的追随者中伤和诽谤中华人民共和国，并且企图打击它的威信的阴谋活动是徒劳的。
    社论指出，今天，以美帝国主义为首的西方帝国主义者为了恢复它在亚洲失去的殖民统治的地盘所进行的阴谋之一，就是离间伟大的中华人民共和国和其他亚洲爱好和平国家之间的关系，并在其中制造不和，疯狂展开“反华运动”。美帝国主义在周恩来总理这次访问缅甸、印度和尼泊尔时也把它的御用报刊和一切宣传机关总动员起来，阴谋诋毁和贬低访问的意义。帝国主义的宣传机关甚至叫嚣，中国必须放弃固有的领土来作为中印协商的前提，还说中印边界问题不仅目前解决不了，就是拖上几代也是不能解决的。社论说，但是，周恩来总理的这次访问证明，除了印度的极少数右派分子以外，广大的印度人民是珍视中印两国间的传统友谊的。
    社论说，帝国主义者现在把中华人民共和国当作眼中钉恨之入骨，那是因为中国曾一度是他的侵略和掠夺的地盘，但现在中华人民共和国以社会主义的大强国像泰山一样地在亚洲矗立起来了，成为鼓舞亚洲人民的民族解放斗争的旗帜，和亚洲和平的强有力的堡垒，因而美帝国主义在中华人民共和国强大的威力面前感到极度的不安和恐怖。
    社论说，美帝国主义的“反华运动”又一次赤裸裸地暴露了它分裂亚洲人民、制造互相攻击、企图从中获得渔翁之利的狡猾的本质。社论接着说，周恩来总理这次对缅甸、印度、尼泊尔的访问给予企图削弱和平力量，阴谋达到侵略目的的美帝国主义以沉重的打击。
    社论说，现在，亚洲人民通过生活体验清楚地知道伟大的中华人民共和国的存在，对他们为争取民族自由和独立的斗争的巨大意义。
    新华社河内1日电　越南“人民报”今天发表评论热烈祝贺周恩来总理出国访问的成就。
    评论指出，周恩来总理的这次访问是为了和平和友谊。评论说，“周恩来总理这次访问的成就，标志着中国一贯奉行和平友好政策的新胜利。这一政策获得了缅甸、印度和尼泊尔人民的热烈欢迎。”
    评论说：“周恩来总理这次访问的成就对亚洲国家的团结作出了积极的贡献，它雄辩地证明了和平共处五项原则和万隆精神的生命力。”
    评论说：“帝国主义和一切反动派拼命地破坏中国加强同缅甸、印度、尼泊尔的友好关系所作的努力。但是，它们终究阻挠不了亚洲各国的日益加强的团结。”
    评论最后说：“当兴奋地等待周恩来总理来访问我国的时候，我国人民热烈欢迎周恩来总理这次为和平和友谊的访问所取得的良好成就。我们愿同中国人民和其他亚洲国家人民一起，为加强和巩固亚非团结，维护亚洲和世界和平而不懈地奋斗。”
