The two sides firmly support the just cause of the Asian and African peoples against colonialism and racial discrimination and for the attainment and maintenance of national independence.

The two governments are pleased to see the very satisfactory achievements made by the two countries in economic and cultural cooperation. At the same time, in view of the continuous enhancement of friendly relations between the People's Republic of China and the Kingdom of Cambodia since 1956, the two governments have decided to further develop their cooperation in all fields.

On behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of China, Premier Zhou Enlai invited Prince Sihanouk and Prime Minister Pho Proeung of the Royal Government of Cambodia to pay a friendly visit to China at their convenience.
