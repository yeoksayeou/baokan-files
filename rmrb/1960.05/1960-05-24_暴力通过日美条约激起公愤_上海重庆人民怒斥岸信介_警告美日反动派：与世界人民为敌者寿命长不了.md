Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 22nd: The Nobusuke Kishi traitorous clique in Japan, resorting to violence to forcibly "pass" the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty in the Diet's House of Representatives, has aroused great indignation among the people of Shanghai. People from all walks of life have held meetings to resolutely support the Japanese people's struggle to overthrow the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, topple the Kishi cabinet, and demand the dissolution of the Diet.

    Han Xinliang, a worker at the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant and a renowned steelmaking expert, said: Kishi Nobusuke is a thorough American running dog, shameless, tyrannical, and completely following the old path of Hideki Tojo. There's nothing good to say about this kind of guy; we must unite to overthrow him. We Chinese workers stand entirely with the Japanese people and support their struggle to the end. Various workshops at the Yimin Food Factory have held multiple meetings in recent days, with over two thousand people signing protests against the U.S.-Japan military alliance.

    Residents of Yaoshui Lane, who suffered brutal sieges during the Japanese militarist invasion of China, are closely following the development of the Japanese people's struggle. Resident Meng Guanghe said: Kishi Nobusuke is wholeheartedly antagonizing the Japanese people and the world's people; he won't live long! Residents also passed a letter to the Japanese people at a meeting, which stated: American imperialism is the common enemy of the people of China and Japan, and the people of the whole world. Let us unite and fight side by side to overthrow American imperialism!

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 21st: The shameless act of American imperialism directing the reactionary and traitorous Nobusuke Kishi group in Japan to forcibly pass the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty illegally through the Japanese Diet has aroused great anger among the people of Chongqing. In the past two days, many factories, schools, and urban and suburban people's communes have held meetings to express their strong protest and to show their firm support for the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle against the United States to the end.

    The broad masses of workers and staff of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, Chongqing No. 3 Steel Plant, Chongqing No. 610 Textile and Dyeing Factory, Chongqing Cement Plant, and many factories and mines in Jiulongpo District and Beibei District have generally held broadcast meetings, symposiums, and newspaper reading meetings in the past two days. Huo Zhaolai, director of the No. 2 Workshop of the Ironmaking Plant of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, said angrily: "I grew up in the Northeast and suffered a lot from Japanese militarism. When I learned that the U.S. imperialist-directed reactionary group of Kishi Nobusuke in Japan had forcibly passed the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty illegally through the Diet, I felt very indignant. We love peace, but if the U.S. and Japanese imperialists insist on imposing war on us, we will resolutely and thoroughly eliminate them."

    Residents of Chongqing's Jiaochangkou, Heping Road, Jiefangbei, and Xinglong Street, who were once heavily bombed by Japanese invading aircraft, have also held meetings in the past two days to denounce the heinous crimes committed by Japanese fascist bandits and to severely condemn the shameless acts of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries. Yang Yuzhen, a resident of No. 158, Shenxiandong Street, said that during the Anti-Japanese War, when Japanese bandit planes indiscriminately bombed Chongqing, they not only destroyed all my family property but also killed ten relatives, including my parents, sister, and sister-in-law. She said angrily: The heinous crimes committed by Japanese fascist bandits are countless. The old blood debts have not yet been repaid, and now the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries are colluding again, forcing the Japanese House of Representatives to illegally pass the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. This can only further arouse our indignation. We will definitely stand on the side of the Japanese people and resolutely fight the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries to the end. The Jiaochangkou residential area, which suffered the most severe bombing by Japanese bandit planes, has now established a people's commune. The broad masses of commune members have generally held various activities in the past two days to support the Japanese people's just struggle and to overthrow the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries. The commune's cultural troupe performed skits in the streets, exposing the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries' conspiracy to plot a new war. Family members of revolutionary soldiers wrote letters to their relatives in the army, encouraging them to be vigilant and ready to give the invaders a devastating blow at any time.

    据新华社重庆21日电　美帝国主义指使日本岸信介反动卖国集团用武力强迫日本国会非法通过日美军事同盟条约的无耻行为，激起了重庆市各界人民的极大愤怒。这两天来，许多工厂、学校及城市和郊区人民公社举行集会表示严重抗议，并表示坚决支持日本人民反美爱国正义斗争到底。
