Xinhua News Agency, Baotou Electric Report: Baotou Iron and Steel Company's various construction and installation units recently self-reliantly manufactured and installed fifteen sets, twenty-five stands of small rolling mills, of which fifteen stands have already been put into production. After all these small rolling mills are put into production, by the second half of this year, the small steel products needed for the construction of Baotou Steel can gradually achieve self-sufficiency.

To vigorously develop rolling mill "small foreign groups" is another new upsurge in vigorously developing diversified operations launched by Baotou Steel construction workers after vigorously developing wet-ground slag concrete, in order to further accelerate the construction of Baotou Steel. At present, almost all of the fifteen small rolling mills that have been put into production were made by the construction workers themselves. In the process of making and installing this batch of rolling mills, the workers adhered to the principle of using foreign methods where possible, using local methods where possible, starting with indigenous methods, and combining indigenous and foreign methods. Therefore, they overcame a series of difficulties encountered in terms of materials, equipment, etc. According to the design, the rolling mill frame should be made of cast steel, the rolls should be made of steel, the bearings should preferably be made of copper, and the reduction system must have a reducer. However, the workers of each unit launched "battle of overcoming difficulties" and cleverly solved these material and equipment problems.

At present, the workers of various construction and installation units of Baotou Steel have also proposed to match these rolling mills with small foreign groups for iron smelting and steelmaking, so that they can exert greater effectiveness in production. On the basis of a small foreign group for iron smelting with an annual output of 65,000 tons of pig iron that has already been built, the production enterprise company is building a steelmaking workshop with an annual output of 40,000 tons at the fastest speed. The Fourth Construction Engineering Company, around the four sets of small rolling mills that have been put into production, has built two cupola furnaces and two small converters. Soon, more and more "small foreign joint ventures" from iron smelting, steelmaking to rolling steel will appear on the Baotou Steel construction site. In this way, the steel demanded by Baotou Steel construction from the state will be reduced to the minimum.

While vigorously developing small foreign groups of iron and steel and striving for complete self-sufficiency in small steel products, Baotou Steel construction workers are also producing other building materials. The building materials and auxiliary materials they have made themselves have now reached sixty or seventy kinds.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan Electric Report: Daye Steel Plant, according to the needs of production development, vigorously runs satellite factories and vigorously develops diversified operations. At present, it has produced more than 30 kinds of main raw materials, materials, spare parts, and mechanical equipment, which has played a great role in ensuring the high-speed development of production.

Daye Steel Plant has vigorously run satellite factories and vigorously developed diversified operations since 1958, gradually developing in the direction of a comprehensive joint enterprise. Now, more than a dozen satellite factories have been built. Among them, the refractory material factory established in 1958, after more than a year of technical transformation, can now produce 50,000 tons of refractory materials annually, with more than 200 product specifications. The two 100-cubic-meter volume blast furnaces and four simple No. 2 coke ovens built by this factory in the same period have been able to produce a large amount of pig iron, ferromanganese and coke every day since the beginning of this year. Among them, ferromanganese not only meets the needs of the factory, but also supplies brother units such as Wuhan Iron and Steel. At present, they are stepping up the construction of a new batch of blast furnaces and simple No. 2 coke ovens, and strive to gradually achieve self-sufficiency in main raw materials such as pig iron and coke.

The plant has also achieved great success in vigorously developing the production of mechanical spare parts and building materials. Since last year, the employees of the Power Department have made more than 840 electric motors and nearly 100 tons of telecommunications equipment, and have also successfully trial-produced a 3,460 kVA transformer. Spare parts and components such as distribution panels and electromagnetic switches have been completely self-sufficient. The employees of the Mechanical Department have also successively produced more than 30 machine tools and equipment such as cupola furnaces, converters, and rolling mills, expanding the production capacity of iron and steel.

Vigorously developing diversified operations and comprehensive utilization has greatly reduced production costs. Only after all refractory materials are self-sufficient, more than 1,300 truckloads and tens of thousands of yuan in freight can be saved every year. (Attached picture)

### 包钢建设职工掀起大搞多种经营新高潮  自造轧钢设备　力争小型钢材自给  大冶钢厂办起一批生产材料、设备的卫星厂

    包钢建设职工掀起大搞多种经营新高潮
    自造轧钢设备　力争小型钢材自给
    大冶钢厂办起一批生产材料、设备的卫星厂
    据新华社包头电　包头钢铁公司各个建筑安装单位最近自力更生地制作和安装了十五套、二十五架小轧钢机，其中有十五架已经投入生产。这些小轧钢机全部投入生产以后，到今年下半年，包钢建设所需的小型钢材就可以逐步做到自给。
    大搞轧钢“小洋群”，是包钢建设者在大搞湿碾矿渣混凝土以后，为了进一步加速包钢建设而掀起的又一个大搞多种经营的新高潮。目前已经投入生产的十五架小轧钢机，几乎全是建筑职工自己制作出来的。在这批轧钢机的制作和安装过程中，职工们坚持了能洋则洋、能土则土，土法上马、土洋结合的方针，因此克服了材料、设备等方面所碰到的一系列困难。按照设计，轧钢机机架要用铸钢，轧辊是钢的，轴瓦最好是铜的，减速系统必须有减速机才行。但是，各单位职工展开了“攻关战役”，巧妙地解决了这些材料和设备问题。
    目前，包钢各个建筑安装单位的职工，又提出要把这些轧钢机和炼铁、炼钢小洋群配成套，使它在生产上发挥更大的效力。生产企业公司在已经建成的一个年产六万五千吨生铁的炼铁小洋群的基础上，正在用最快的速度建设一座年产四万吨的炼钢车间。第四建筑工程公司围绕已投入生产的四套小轧钢机，已经建成两座化铁炉、两座小转炉。不久，在包钢工地上将出现愈来愈多的从炼铁、炼钢一直到轧钢的“小洋联”。这样，包钢建设向国家要的钢材将减少到最低限度。
    在大搞钢铁小洋群、力争小型钢材全部自给的同时，包钢建筑职工也在生产其它建筑材料。他们自制的建筑材料和辅助材料，目前已达六、七十种。
    据新华社武汉电　大冶钢厂根据生产发展的需要，大办卫星工厂，大搞多种经营，目前已经生产出三十多种主要原料、材料、备品、备件和机械设备，对保证生产高速度发展起了很大的作用。
    大冶钢厂从1958年就大办卫星工厂，大搞多种经营，逐步向综合性的联合企业的方向发展。现在，已建起十几个卫星工厂。其中在1958年建立的耐火材料厂，经过一年多的技术改造，现在已能年产五万吨耐火材料，产品规格有二百多种。这个厂在同一时期建成的两座一百立方米容积的高炉和四座简易二号焦炉，今年以来每天已可生产大量生铁、锰铁和焦炭，其中锰铁不仅满足了本厂的需要，并供应了武钢等兄弟单位。目前他们正在加紧建设一批新的高炉和简易二号焦炉，力争逐步做到生铁、焦炭等主要原料自给。
    这个厂大搞机械备品制作和建筑材料生产，也获得了巨大的成绩。动力部职工去年以来已制了八百四十多台电动机和近百吨电讯器材，还试制成功一台三千四百六十千伏安变压器，配电盘、电磁开关等备品备件已经完全做到了自给自足。机械部职工也先后生产了三十多台机床和化铁炉、转炉、轧钢机等设备，扩大了钢铁的生产能力。
    大搞多种经营和综合利用，大大降低了生产成本。仅耐火材料全部自给以后，每年就可节约一千三百多个车皮，几十万元的运费。（附图片）
