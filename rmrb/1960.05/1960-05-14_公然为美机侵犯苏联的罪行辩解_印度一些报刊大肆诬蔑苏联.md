Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 13th: After the U.S. crime of sending planes to intrude into Soviet airspace for espionage activities was exposed, some newspapers in India not only did not condemn the United States, but instead launched a wave of slander against the Soviet Union.

The "New India Times" published a commentary on the 12th, actually accusing the Soviet Union of not publicizing the crime of American planes violating Soviet airspace. It slandered the Soviet Union's exposure of the aggression as "harboring malicious intent." Echoing the U.S. propaganda machine, it clamored, "The question is, why did the Soviet Union talk about all this when the summit was about to be held. This incident could have been kept confidential; if it was necessary to publicize this incident, it could have been done without malicious intent."

The "Amrita Bazar Patrika" openly defended the U.S. act of aggression, saying that intelligence gathering work will continue until war is declared illegal. "In this respect, the statement issued by the U.S. State Department is completely correct." This newspaper also blamed the American act of aggression on "the Russians' consistent unwillingness to accept (America's) open-door policy." It said, "As long as the Iron Curtain continues to exist, the world should be prepared to face such embarrassing incidents." The newspaper also attacked the solemn warning issued by the Soviet Minister of Defense as an "unfortunate speech."

The "Indian National Daily" slandered Khrushchev's exposure of the crime of U.S. planes violating Soviet airspace in an editorial as "part of the propaganda tactics adopted on the eve of the summit."

It also whitewashed the United States, saying that "America's admission undoubtedly saved the summit."

The "Hindustan Standard" attacked Khrushchev's warning to the American aggressors in an editorial, saying that the language used by the Soviet leader "may cause disappointment everywhere."

    公然为美机侵犯苏联的罪行辩解
     印度一些报刊大肆诬蔑苏联
    新华社新德里13日电　印度的一些报刊在美国派飞机侵入苏联领空进行间谍活动的罪行被揭露以后，不仅不谴责美国，反而掀起了一个诬蔑苏联的浪潮。
    “新印度时报”12日发表评论，竟然指责苏联不应该把美国飞机侵犯苏联领空的罪行公布于世。它诬蔑苏联揭发侵略是“怀有恶意”。它学着美国宣传机器的腔调叫嚣说：“问题是，为什么苏联在要举行最高级会议的时候讲这一切。这个事件是可以加以保密的；如果有必要宣传这个事件，可以不怀恶意地进行。”
    “甘露市场报”公开为美国的侵略行为辩护说，在战争没有被宣布为非法之前，收集情报的工作将继续下去。“在这一点上，美国国务院发表的声明是完全正确的。”这家报纸也颠倒黑白地把美国的侵略行为归咎于“俄国人一直不愿意接受（美国的）门户开放政策”。它说：“只要铁幕继续存在，世界就应该准备面对这种令人为难的事件。”这家报纸还攻击苏联国防部长提出的严正警告是“不幸的讲话”。
    “印度民族日报”在社论中诬蔑赫鲁晓夫揭露美国飞机侵犯苏联领空的罪行是“在最高级会议前夕所采用的宣传手段的一部分”。
    它还为美国抹粉说，“美国的承认毫无疑问地拯救了最高级会议。”
    “欢喜市场报”在社论中大肆攻击赫鲁晓夫对美国侵略者的警告，说这位苏联领导人所使用的语言“可能在各地引起失望”。
