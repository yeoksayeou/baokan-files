    Yakeshi: Over 30,000 People Rally and Parade
    (Our dispatch) Yakeshi, the capital of the Greater Khingan Range forest area, the green treasure house of the motherland, saw over 30,000 people joyously rally and parade in five different areas on May 1st. They celebrated "May Day" and the 13th anniversary of the founding of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and celebrated the great achievement of the entire forest area completing more than half of this year's timber production plan in four months.
    In Yakeshi, twenty German Democratic Republic experts, expert wives and children, headed by Kurt Marx, who are helping our country build a forest chemical industry, spent the festive season with the forestry workers, filling the forest area's holiday with an atmosphere of internationalist friendship.
    Many of the participants in the parade were housewives who had just stepped out of their homes to join the urban people's communes. Together with the workers, they shouted "Long live the people's communes!" with great excitement. (Bai Hao)
