Spring Planting Must Start and End Well

Many regions have basically completed their sowing tasks. The current task is to continue to carry forward the fighting spirit, persevere to the end, until a complete victory is achieved. In all regions where the spring planting task is nearing its final stage, sowing work must be firmly grasped in at least three aspects:

	First, mopping up. In places where the cotton and oilseed planting plans have been basically completed, there are varying degrees of remaining tasks, ranging from a few percent to more than ten percent. From the perspective of various regions and production units, these remaining tasks seem small, and whether or not they are completed seems irrelevant to the overall situation. Some people tend to think: spring farming is very busy, the area of arable land is limited, so let's just leave a little bit undone. We can increase production measures later, and make up for the yield. Moreover, we can plant more during the summer sowing to make up for it. Once the momentum slackens, the tail is left behind. Taking cotton as an example, judging from the situation in previous years, adding up the remaining tasks from all over the country often amounts to millions of mu; calculating at an average yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu, that is several hundred million jin, a considerable amount. It must be understood that the state has already taken into account the factors of increasing yield per unit area when arranging the planting plans and total output plans for various crops. Only by ensuring the planted area while striving to increase yield per unit area can the total output plan be completed. To put it another way, even if the method of increasing yield per unit area can make up for the loss of output due to the reduction of sown area, that is a passive approach. If the mu are fully planted and the yield per unit area is increased, wouldn't it be possible to create more material wealth for socialism? Any "tail" must be "swept" away, and "sweeping" must "sweep" clean. Rather plant more than less, to prevent the actual harvested area from being reduced due to natural disasters. Some places this year are striving to plant more "insurance cotton fields" beyond the plan. This approach is very necessary.
	Second, adding to the edges. According to inspections in some places, although some plots have been sown, they have not been sown to the end, nor to the edge. This is sometimes due to the limitations of the machinery, power, or terrain used, and sometimes due to the negligence of the cultivators. In any case, these seemingly scattered field edges and corners add up to a considerable figure. If they are not replanted, the total number of sown acres will actually be discounted. As long as the inspection is timely and the replanting is timely, replanting the field edges is not difficult. Only by planting all the field heads, field edges, and corners well can it be considered "fully planted." If you plant, you must plant enough. One mu is one mu, not a cent or a fraction can be lost; completing 99% is also not completing the plan. It must be meticulous, without any discount, and the sowing plan must be completed 100%.
	Third, replanting seedlings. Due to various reasons, after emergence, there will inevitably be phenomena of missing seedlings and broken rows. An important standard for judging whether the quality of sowing is good or not is whether there are full and strong seedlings. It should be guaranteed that not a single seedling is missing, and not a single seedling is weak. Don't underestimate a single seedling. Our country is so large. If a few seedlings are missing per mu, the loss will be very large when added up. Calculating at 5,000 cotton plants per mu, if 50 seedlings are missing per mu, planting 10 million mu is equivalent to planting 100,000 mu less. Therefore, doing a good job in checking seedlings and replanting seedlings in a timely manner is also a major task. In order to make the replanted seedlings grow consistently with the original seedlings, preparations must be made as early as possible. Some communes use cotton nutrient pots to raise seedlings or use hotbeds to raise seedlings, for the purpose of replanting seedlings. This is a very good method. You can also use seedling transplanters to move excess cotton seedlings from other places to places where seedlings are missing. In this work, technical innovation can be carried out on a large scale to create a variety of clever methods and popularize them. If there are no reserve seedlings planted, and no excess seedlings can be found, those that can be replanted should be replanted. If the season does not allow replanting of the same crops, other crops should be replanted. In short, we must cherish the land and not waste an inch of land.

Regions that have basically completed the spring planting task should launch a large-scale inspection and replenishment movement to check the area, check the emergence of seedlings, replenish the area, and replenish the missing seedlings. In this movement, we must further implement the state sowing plan, ensure that the requirements for sown area and quality are met, and make this year's spring planting work start and end well.

### 春播要善始善终

    春播要善始善终
    许多地区，播种任务已经基本完成。当前的任务是，继续发扬斗志，坚持到底，直到全局大胜。在春播任务接近最后阶段的一切地区，对于播种工作至少还要从三个方面紧紧抓住不放：
    一是扫尾。基本完成棉花、油料等播种计划的地方，程度不等地还缺一些尾数，少者百分之几，多者百分之十几。就各个地区、各个生产单位来看，这些尾数似乎很小，完成与否似乎无关大局。有些人往往认为：春天农活很忙，耕地面积有限，缺一点就缺着吧，以后把增产措施加大些，也可以把产量补上了。而且，到夏播的时候，还可以多种一些补上。后劲一松，就把尾巴留下来了。以棉花来说，就往年的情况看，把全国各地的尾数加起来，往往有成百万亩；以每亩平均产皮棉百斤计算，就是几亿斤，数目实在不小。要知道，国家在安排各种作物的种植计划和总产量计划的时候，已经把提高单位面积产量的因素估计进去了。必须在保证种植面积的同时力求提高单位产量，才能完成总产量计划。退一步说，即使用提高单位面积产量的方法，能把由于减少播种面积所损失的产量补上，那也是消极的作法。如果把亩数种足，又提高了单位面积产量，不是可以为社会主义创造更多的物质财富吗？有“尾”一定要“扫”，“扫”一定要“扫”光。宁可多种，不可少种，以防因自然灾害而减少实收面积。有些地方今年力争超计划多种“保险棉田”。这种办法十分必要。
    二是加边。据一些地方检查，有些地块虽然已经播种，但是没有种到头，没有种到边。这有的是受使用的机具、动力或地形的限制，有的是由于耕作者的疏忽。不管怎样，这些看起来零零星星的地头地边地角，加起来也是相当可观的一笔数字。如果不把它们补种起来，完成播种面积的总数，实际上就要打折扣。只要及时检查，及时补种，补种地边并不困难。只有把地头、地边、地角全都种好，才算是“种足”了。既种就要种足，种一亩就是一亩，一分一厘也不能丢；完成99％也是没有完成计划，一定要一丝不苟，一点不能折扣，一定要百分之百的完成播种计划。
    三是补苗。由于种种原因，出苗以后，难免还有缺苗、断条的现象。播种质量好不好的一个重要标准就是是不是全苗全壮。应该保证一棵不少，一棵不弱。千万不要小看一棵苗，我们的国家这样大，一亩缺几棵苗，总算起来，损失就很大。以每亩棉花五千棵计算，一亩缺苗五十棵，如种一千万亩，就等于少种十万亩。因此，及时做好查苗、补苗工作也是一个重大的任务。为了使补种的苗和原有的苗生长一致，要及早作好准备。有些公社用棉花营养钵来育苗或者用温床育苗，以备补苗之用，这是很好的办法。也可以用移苗器把别处多余的棉苗移到缺苗的地方去。在这个工作上，很可以大搞技术革新，创造多种多样的巧办法，普遍推广。如果没有种下预备苗，也找不到多余的苗，能补种的就要补种，季节不允许补种同样作物的要补种其它作物。总之，要珍惜土地，不可浪费一寸土地。
    基本完成春播任务的地区，都要开展查面积、查出苗、补面积、补缺苗的大查大补运动。要在这个运动中进一步贯彻执行国家播种计划，确保完成播种面积和质量的要求，使今年的春播工作善始善终。
