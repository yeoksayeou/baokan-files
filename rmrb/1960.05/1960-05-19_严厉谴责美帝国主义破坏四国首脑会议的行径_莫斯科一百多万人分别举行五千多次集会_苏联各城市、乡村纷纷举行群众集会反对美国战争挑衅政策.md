Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 18th: The US imperialism's shameless actions in sabotaging the Four-Power Summit Conference have aroused irrepressible anger among the broad masses of Soviet working people. In recent days, mass rallies have been held in factories, enterprises, institutions and schools in various places. According to incomplete statistics, in Moscow alone, more than 5,600 meetings were held on the 17th, with the participation of more than 1.2 million people. In their speeches, the participants unanimously expressed their approval of the statement made by Khrushchev in Paris on the 16th, strongly condemned the US ruling clique's despicable actions in sabotaging the Four-Power Summit Conference, and denounced the dangerous game of playing with fire by the "Cold War" defenders.

    At a rally attended by more than 3,000 employees at the Vladimir Ilyich Factory in Moscow, driller Pogorelov said, "We fully support the position taken by the head of the Soviet government, and we condemn with extreme indignation the US imperialists who have adopted a hostile policy towards the Soviet Union and the socialist camp. The US provocateurs are shameless!" The Moscow "Dynamo" factory held a general staff meeting attended by 5,000 people. Electric welder Starovoitov said in his speech that Khrushchev's statement to the heads of state of the United States, Britain, and France expressed the thoughts and emotions of the entire Soviet people. All progressive mankind had great hopes for the convening of the Four-Power Summit Conference, but on the eve of the conference, US imperialism carried out aggressive activities against our country, and we must never allow them to do so again!

    A rally attended by more than 1,000 representatives from all walks of life was held in Sverdlovsk. Zamirya, the first secretary of the Sverdlovsk City Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, said that all the people of the Urals were very satisfied with Khrushchev's straightforward statement. He said, "We have full confidence in unswervingly defending the cause of peace, and the threats of US militarists cannot scare us. If the US government is obsessed with its own ways and continues to implement the policy of sending spies to our country, then serious consequences await them." The meeting also passed a resolution supporting Khrushchev's statement.

    Yarvisalu, a female worker at the Punaskoyte silk weaving factory in Tallinn, said at a rally, "When someone threatens us with espionage, there must be no peaceful negotiations. Let the imperialist gentlemen know that this is the unanimous opinion of the entire Soviet people."

    Officers and soldiers of the Soviet combat troops also held rallies in support of Khrushchev's statement. Novichkov, an officer of a unit in the Far East Military District, said at the meeting, "We cannot negotiate with the heads of state who regard treachery and robbery as a policy. For all of us soldiers, the conclusion is very clear: we must be better prepared for combat."

Xinhua News Agency, 18th: TASS, Moscow, 17th: Cities, villages, enterprises and institutions across the Soviet Union continue to hold mass rallies in support of the statement made by Khrushchev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, at the preparatory meeting of the Four-Power Summit Conference in Paris.

    A. N. Nesmeyanov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, said at the general meeting of the Soviet Academy of Sciences in Moscow on the 17th that the provocative actions taken by the US leaders directly on the eve of the summit conference, and obviously at this designated time, seemed very insidious. He said that Khrushchev's tough statement on behalf of the Soviet government was unanimously approved by the entire Soviet people. Soviet scientists expressed great indignation at the provocative actions of the United States in provoking the Cold War or the Hot War. Soviet scientists pledged to resolutely dedicate all their strength to defending the socialist motherland.

    The workers of the Moscow "Dynamo" factory unanimously adopted a resolution agreeing with the statement of the head of the Soviet government and expressing indignation at the provocative policies implemented by US officials.

    Blast furnace gas worker Leonenko said at a mass rally of workers at the Petrovsky Steel Plant in Dnepropetrovsk, Ukraine, "We say to the likes of Eisenhower, Herter, and Allen Dulles that their policy of threatening, spying, and provoking the Soviet Union is against the interests and wishes of the American people. Sooner or later, this policy will go bankrupt completely." Leonenko stressed that the will of the Soviet government is the will of the entire Soviet people. This will is firm and unwavering, and will always be supported by peace-loving people in all countries of the world.

    At a mass rally of workers at the "Karadag Oil" Trust in Baku, fitter Hasanov said that Khrushchev was absolutely right to point out that in the current situation, the summit conference cannot effectively carry out work that is beneficial to peace.

    Kozlov, a car worker at the Kishinev Auto Parts Factory in Moldova, said, "Can we sit down and have a calm negotiation with a robber with a knife hidden in his chest? Negotiations can only be conducted on an equal footing."

    Shabarov, a driver in the Ekibastuz coal mining area of Kazakhstan, said at a mass rally, "Khrushchev is right. Since the US government has declared that the robber flights to our territory are part of its policy, we certainly cannot negotiate under these circumstances."

    Collective farms and state-owned farms in Tbilisi, Kiev, Gorky, Vilnius, Vladivostok, Khabarovsk and other places also held rallies, unanimously supporting the statement of the head of the Soviet government.

    严厉谴责美帝国主义破坏四国首脑会议的行径
    莫斯科一百多万人分别举行五千多次集会
    苏联各城市、乡村纷纷举行群众集会反对美国战争挑衅政策
    据新华社莫斯科18日电　美帝国主义破坏四国首脑会议的无耻行径，激起了苏联广大劳动人民不可抑制的愤怒。连日来，各地工厂、企业、机关和学校纷纷举行群众集会。据不完全统计，仅在首都莫斯科，在17日一天当中就举行了五千六百多次集会，参加会议的达一百二十多万人。与会者在发言中一致表示赞同赫鲁晓夫16日在巴黎所发表的声明，严厉谴责美国统治集团破坏四国首脑会议的卑鄙行动，痛斥“冷战”维护者危险的玩火把戏。
    在莫斯科弗拉基米尔·伊里奇工厂举行的有三千多名职工参加的集会上，钻工波戈雷诺夫说，“我们完全支持苏联政府首脑采取的立场，我们极其愤慨地谴责对苏联和社会主义阵营采取敌对政策的美帝国主义者。美国挑衅者无耻！”莫斯科“狄纳莫”工厂举行了有五千人参加的全体职工大会。电焊工斯塔罗沃伊托夫讲话说，赫鲁晓夫向美国、英国、法国三国首脑发表的声明，表达了全体苏联人民的思想和情绪。全体进步人类怀着很大的希望期待着四国首脑会议的召开，然而，美帝国主义在会议前夕却对我国进行了侵略活动，我们绝不能允许他们再这样干下去！
    斯维德洛夫斯克市举行了有各界代表一千多人参加的集会，苏联共产党斯维德洛夫斯克市委会第一书记扎米里亚说，乌拉尔的全体人民对赫鲁晓夫的直截了当的声明非常满意。他说，“我们有充分的信心来始终不渝地保卫和平事业，美国黩武主义者的威胁吓不倒我们。如果美国政府执迷不悟，继续执行向我国派遣间谍的政策，那么严重的后果在等待着他们。”会议还通过了一项支持赫鲁晓夫的声明的决议。
    塔林的“普纳斯科伊特”丝织厂女工亚尔维萨卢在集会上说，“当有人用间谍活动威胁我们的时候，绝不能进行和平的谈判，要让帝国主义先生们知道，这是全体苏联人民一致的意见。”
    苏联各战斗部队的官兵也都举行了支持赫鲁晓夫声明的集会。远东军区某部队军官诺维奇科夫在会上说，“我们根本不能同把背信弃义和进行强盗活动作为政策的国家首脑进行谈判。对我们所有军人来说，结论非常清楚：要更加作好战斗准备。”
    据新华社18日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科17日讯：苏联各城市、乡村、企业和机关继续纷纷举行群众集会，拥护苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在巴黎四国首脑会议预备会议上的声明。
    苏联科学院院长亚·?斯米扬诺夫17日在莫斯科苏联科学院全体大会上说，美国领导人直接在首脑会议前夕，并显然是挑定这个时间所进行的挑衅行动看起来是很阴险的。他说，赫鲁晓夫代表苏联政府发表的强硬声明得到全体苏联人民的一致赞同。苏联科学家对美国的挑起冷战或者热战的挑衅行动表示极大的愤慨。苏联科学家保证坚决为捍卫社会主义祖国献出自己的一切力量。
    在莫斯科“狄纳莫”工厂的工人一致通过决议，同意苏联政府首脑的声明，并对美国官方人士所执行的挑衅政策表示愤慨。
    高炉煤气工列奥年科在乌克兰第聂泊罗彼得罗夫斯克的彼得罗夫斯基钢铁厂工人群众大会上说，我们对艾森豪威尔、赫脱、艾伦·杜勒斯之流说，他们对苏联实行威胁、间谍活动和挑衅性的政策，这是违背美国人民的利益和愿望的。这种政策迟早会彻底破产。列奥年科着重指出，苏联政府的意志就是全体苏联人民的意志。这种意志是坚定不移的，并将永远得到世界上爱好和平的各国人民的支持。
    在巴库“卡拉达格石油”托辣斯工人群众大会上，钳工加萨诺夫说，赫鲁晓夫指出，在目前的形势下，首脑会议不能有效地进行有利于和平的工作，这是完全正确的。
    摩尔达维亚的基什尼奥夫汽车零件厂的车工科兹洛夫说，难道可以同怀中藏刀的强盗坐在一起平心静气地进行谈判吗？谈判只能在平等的基础上进行。
    哈萨克埃基巴斯图兹煤区的司机夏巴罗夫在群众大会上说，赫鲁晓夫说得对，美国政府既然声明到我国领土的强盗飞行是自己政策的一部分，我们当然不能在这种情况下进行谈判。
    在第比利斯、基辅、高尔基、维尔纽斯、海参崴、伯力等地的集体农庄和国营农场也纷纷集会，一致支持苏联政府首脑的声明。
