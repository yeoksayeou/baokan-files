	Guangdong Party committees at all levels strengthen leadership; Guangxi mines actively promote advanced experiences.
	Yunnan mines launch a massive technical revolution; Guizhou transforms more than two hundred small coal kilns.
	Hunan overcomes flooding to ensure increased production during the rainy season; Hubei focuses on key areas, increasing output.

	Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou - Guangdong Province, from large coal mines to county and commune-run local small mines, has launched a high tide of coal production increase.

	The four major coal mines in northern Guangdong - Nanling, Lianyang, Quren, and Luojiadu - despite continuous rain in early May and flash floods in some areas, coal miners still overcame difficulties and increased coal production. In the Lianyang mining area, twenty-three work faces were flooded in early May, but after the entire mine fought the flood, most of the work faces were quickly drained and restored to normal production. Production in early May increased by more than 10% compared to the same period last month.

	While focusing on current coal production, all parts of the province have also launched a campaign to build small coal "native groups" and "foreign groups." The province will build one hundred pairs of small "foreign" mine shafts this year; in addition, it will intensify the technical transformation of one thousand pairs of small "native" kilns to greatly increase their production capacity.

	In order to strengthen leadership over this campaign, the CPC Guangdong Provincial Committee has formed a Coal Seizure Headquarters headed by responsible comrades, and dispatched a group of leading cadres to key coal mines to set up camp and provide specific command. Local small coal mines are also respectively responsible at the county party committee or commune party committee level, strengthening leadership. Relevant departments such as the Production Committee, the Department of Commerce, and the Railway Bureau have also jointly established a Coal Seizure Logistics Department, responsible for supplying the equipment, materials, and daily necessities needed by key coal mines. The relevant departments in Guangzhou have transferred twenty machine tools and a group of technicians to support the machine repair factories of key coal mines. The railway bureau and other relevant parties are speeding up the construction of special coal transportation lines to achieve the provincial party committee's requirement that about 80% of the raw coal produced must be guaranteed to be shipped out.

	Guangdong Province, which historically relied on the north-south coal transportation, has seen great development in coal production since liberation. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the CPC Guangdong Provincial Committee has focused on coal production, further increasing the amount of raw coal rapidly. Coal production in the first quarter of this year has exceeded two million tons. Now the province has achieved a large degree of self-sufficiency in the coal it needs.

	Xinhua News Agency, Nanning - Coal industry workers in Guangxi launched a technical innovation and technical revolution movement, which has led to a sharp increase in coal production. By the end of April this year, the region's raw coal production had reached 42% of this year's national plan, an increase of 34% over the same period last year.

	The advanced experience of "four-eight cross-operation" has been universally promoted in various mines. This alone has increased the average production of raw coal by more than 40%, while reducing costs and ensuring production safety. After promoting advanced experiences such as the rapid transfer of electric chutes, Heshan Coal Mine, the largest in the autonomous region, created a new record of 1,050 tons of coal per day, an increase of 70% over the daily plan.

	Leading cadres of various coal mines have gone deep into the front lines of production during technical innovation, specifically leading the Red Flag competition centered on "five improvements" (improving mining methods, improving coal mining methods, improving tools and equipment, improving ground transportation, and improving safety and working conditions), and working with technicians and workers to solve problems in production in a timely manner. Because the leading cadres of Heshan Coal Mine went deep into the grassroots organizations and strengthened leadership over the groups, 90% of the work teams in the mine have jumped to become advanced work teams in the competition.

	Xinhua News Agency, Kunming - Coal mines in Yunnan Province have generally launched a technical revolution movement, allowing coal production to continue to leap forward. From January to April this year, the province's coal production exceeded the national plan by 11%, and output increased by more than 11% compared with the same period last year.

	More than 90% of the coal enterprises in Yunnan Province are small coal mines, undertaking more than half of the province's coal production tasks. At present, more than 70% of the province's small coal mines have achieved railization, chuteization, cablewayization, and funnelization of transportation and loading and unloading, basically eliminating human carrying, greatly improving production efficiency. Many small coal mine workers have relied on their own efforts, making use of local conditions and simple equipment to manufacture a batch of native electric locomotives, native electric winches, foot-operated blowers, automatic water pumps, top plate alarms, automatic ventilation devices, and other native or foreign equipment, improving workers' working conditions, increasing output, and creating conditions for the transition to "small foreign groups." Large and medium-sized coal mines have also carried out a series of technical innovations. Around the key to production, the workers of Siying Coal Mine manufactured a batch of electric rock drills, coal mining machines, and loading and unloading platforms, allowing many workers to quickly discard hand hammers, picks, and carrying poles, and the daily output of raw coal gradually increased from 1,500 tons to about 2,500 tons.

	Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang - While stepping up the construction of modern coal mines, Guizhou Province has strengthened leadership over existing mines, making raw coal production flourish. From the beginning of this year to now, the province's raw coal production has increased by more than 40% compared with the same period last year, equivalent to about two-thirds of the total output of the entire last year.

	Since the beginning of this year, the coal industry system of Guizhou Province has mobilized the masses to launch a technical innovation and technical revolution movement. Focusing on the weak links in production, employees have implemented more than 7,000 rationalization proposals, promoting current production. The workers of Aofan Chong Coal Mine changed the underground cart transportation to electric chutes and electric locomotive transportation, solving the contradiction that transportation could not keep up with mining and excavation, and increasing the output of raw coal by about one time.

	Since the beginning of this year, the province has also strengthened the technical transformation of small coal kilns. More than 200 small coal kilns have already been transformed or are in the process of being transformed. These small coal kilns have widened the tunnels, installed ventilation, drainage, lifting, towing, and lighting equipment, and some coal mines have also installed some foreign equipment, which greatly improved working conditions and generally increased production.

	Xinhua News Agency, Changsha - Hunan has broken the regular pattern of coal production decline during the rainy season in previous years, and coal production has continued to leap forward during the rainy season this year.

	The second quarter is the rainy season in Hunan. Since April this year, it has been raining continuously, which has brought difficulties to coal production. In order to ensure increased production during the rainy season, the Hunan coal industry department, through investigation and research, basically clarified the situation of the old tunnels with hidden water hazards in advance, made a distribution map of the old tunnels, and delimited the warning line. Since the beginning of this year, a total of 3,402 old tunnels have been blocked, and at the same time, the maintenance of drainage equipment has been strengthened, and 534 native water pumps have been added, increasing drainage capacity, thus controlling the water hazards. In April last year, more than 860 mines in the province were flooded, and the daily output of raw coal decreased by more than 10,000 tons; this year, in April, not only was the production plan completed one day ahead of schedule, but also the accidents of water penetration in old tunnels were basically eliminated.

	On the basis of consolidating the achievements of technical innovation and vigorously promoting new coal mining methods and four-eight cross-operation, the coal mines have focused on production since April, focusing on tunneling, basic construction, and transfer work. Now the coal mines have basically achieved a balance between mining and tunneling. Due to the acceleration of the project progress, two pairs of mines with an annual output of 300,000 tons of coal were handed over for production ahead of schedule.

	Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan - Coal production in Hubei Province rose steadily in early May. According to statistics from the 1st to the 8th alone, the average daily coal output in the province increased by about 18% compared with the same period in April.

	In May, the coal industry departments of Hubei Province generally mobilized the masses to focus on key production issues. Cadres of various mining bureaus generally went deep into the mines to focus on tunneling and transportation. In order to solve the key problem of tunneling lagging behind mining, Zigui Mining Bureau adjusted the labor organization, strengthened the tunneling force, and improved the tunneling progress. The current daily production level of this mining bureau has increased by 57% compared with mid-April. The coal industry departments of Hubei Province have also carried out technical transformation of small coal kilns, which account for more than half of the province's coal production, and improved the production capacity of small coal kilns.

    南方六省大抓煤炭生产
    广东党委层层加强领导　　广西各矿认真推广先进经验
  　云南矿矿大闹技术革命    贵州改造二百多小煤窑
  　湖南战胜水患保证雨季增产　　湖北围攻关键产量上升
    据新华社广州电　广东省从大煤矿到县、社办的地方小矿，都掀起了增产煤炭的高潮。
    南岭、连阳、曲仁和罗家渡等粤北四大煤矿，尽管5月上旬阴雨连绵，有些地区山洪暴发，但煤矿职工仍然战胜困难，提高了煤炭的产量。连阳矿区5月初曾有二十三个工作面遭到水淹，但经过全矿职工和洪水搏斗，很快有大部分工作面排干渍水，恢复正常生产，5月上旬还比上月同期增产10％以上。
    在大抓当前煤炭生产的同时，全省各地还开展了建设煤炭小土群、小洋群的运动。全省在今年内将要兴建一百对小洋矿井；此外还要加紧对一千对小土窑进行技术改造，以大大提高它们的生产能力。
    为了加强对这个运动的领导，中共广东省委已组成由负责同志挂帅的夺煤总指挥部，并派出一批领导干部，分赴重点煤矿，安营扎寨，具体指挥。各地方小煤矿也分别由县委或公社党委层层负责，加强领导。生产委员会、商业厅、铁路局等有关部门还联合成立夺煤后勤部，专责供应重点煤矿所需的设备、材料和日用品等。广州市有关部门已抽调机床二十部和一批技工，前往支援重点煤矿的机修工厂。铁路局等有关方面正在加快修建运煤专用线，以实现省委提出的生产出的原煤要保证运出80％左右的要求。
    在历史上一向依靠北煤南运的广东省，解放后煤炭生产有很大的发展。从1958年大跃进以来，中共广东省委大抓煤炭生产，更使原煤量迅速提高。今年第一季度产煤已超过二百万吨。现在全省所需的煤已做到了大部分自给。
    据新华社南宁电　广西煤炭工业职工开展技术革新和技术革命运动，使煤炭产量猛增。今年到4月底为止，全区原煤产量已达到今年国家计划的42％，比去年同期增长34％。
    各矿井普遍推广“四八交叉作业”的先进经验，仅这一项，就使原煤产量平均提高40％以上，而且成本降低，生产安全。自治区内最大的合山煤矿推广了快速移电溜子等先进经验后，创造了日产煤一千零五十吨的新纪录，比日计划提高70％。
    各煤矿领导干部在技术革新中都深入生产第一线，具体领导开展“五改”（改进开拓方式、改进采煤方法、改进工具设备、改善地面运输、改善安全和劳动条件）为中心的红旗竞赛，并与技术人员和工人结合，及时解决生产中的问题。合山煤矿由于领导干部深入基层组织，加强了对小组的领导，全矿已有90％的班组在竞赛中跃升为先进班组。
    据新华社昆明电　云南省各煤矿普遍开展技术革命运动，使煤炭生产继续跃进。今年1月至4月，全省煤炭生产超额11％完成国家计划，产量比去年同期增长11％以上。
    云南省的煤炭企业中，90％以上是小煤矿，担负着全省半数以上的煤炭生产任务。目前，全省已有70％以上的小煤矿实现了运输装卸轨道化、溜槽化、索道化和漏斗化，基本上消灭了人背人挑现象，大大提高了生产效率。不少小煤矿的职工自力更生、因陋就简地制造出一批土电机车、土电绞车、脚踏鼓风机、自动水泵、顶板警报器、自动通风装置等土的或洋的设备，改善了工人的劳动条件，提高了产量，为向“小洋群”过渡创造了条件。各大中型煤矿也进行了一系列的技术革新。四营煤矿职工围绕生产关键，自己制造一批电动凿岩机、采煤机、装卸台，使许多工人很快丢掉了手锤、洋镐、扁担，原煤日产量由一千五百吨逐步提高到二千五百吨左右。
    据新华社贵阳电　贵州省在加紧建设现代化煤矿的同时，加强对现有矿井的领导，使原煤生产蒸蒸日上。从今年初到现在，全省原煤产量已比去年同期增长40％以上，约等于去年全年总产量的三分之二左右。
    贵州省煤炭工业系统从年初起发动群众展开了技术革新和技术革命运动。职工们针对生产中的薄弱环节，实现了七千多件合理化建议，推动了当前生产。敖凡冲煤井的职工，把井下人推车运输改为电溜子、电机车运输。解决了运输赶不上采掘的矛盾，使原煤产量提高了一倍左右。
    从今年年初以来，全省还加强了对小煤窑的技术改造。现在已经改造和正在着手改造的小煤窑有二百多个。这些小煤窑都加宽了坑道，安装了通风、抽水、提升、拖曳和照明等土设备，有的煤井还安装了一部分洋设备，使劳动条件大大改善，产量普遍提高。
    据新华社长沙电　湖南打破历年雨季煤炭减产的常规，今年雨季煤炭生产持续跃进。
    湖南地区第二季度是多雨的季节。今年4月份以来更是阴雨连绵，给煤炭生产带来了困难。为了保证雨季增产，湖南煤炭工业部门通过调查研究，事先基本上摸清了潜藏水患的老窿情况，作出了老窿分布图，划定了警戒线，今年以来共已堵塞老窿三千四百零二个，同时加强了对排水设备的检修工作，增加了五百三十四台土水泵，提高了排水能力，因此制服了水患。去年4月，全省有八百六十多个矿井遭淹，原煤日产量降低一万多吨；今年4月不但提前一天完成了生产计划，还基本上消灭了老窿穿水事故。
    各煤矿在巩固技术革新成果和大力推行新的采煤法和四八交叉作业的基础上，4月份以来以生产为主，大抓掘进、基本建设和调运工作。现在各煤矿已基本上作到采掘平衡。由于加速工程进度，两对年产三十万吨煤的矿井提前移交生产。
    据新华社武汉电　湖北省5月上旬的煤炭生产稳步上升。仅据1日到8日的统计，全省煤炭平均日产量比4月同期提高18％左右。
    湖北省煤炭工业部门在5月份普遍发动群众，围攻生产关键。各矿务局的干部普遍深入矿井，抓掘进、抓运输。秭归矿务局为了解决掘进落后于回采的关键问题，调整了劳动组织，加强了掘进力量，提高了掘进进度。这个矿务局现在的日产水平已比4月中旬提高57％。湖北省煤炭工业部门还对占全省煤炭产量一半以上的小煤窑，进行了技术改造，提高了小煤窑的生产能力。
