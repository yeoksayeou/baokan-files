    Reconstructing Mountains and Rivers, Conquering the Ocean
    Meng Xiande, First Secretary of the Zhanjiang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
    Zhanjiang Prefecture is located in the southwest of Guangdong Province, at the southernmost tip of the Chinese mainland, backed by the Five Ridges mountain range and facing the vast ocean. It has a coastline of 2,000 kilometers and hundreds of islands of varying sizes. The region currently has 15 million mu of cultivated land, with approximately 8 million mu or more of arable wasteland.
    The Zhanjiang area was originally a rich coastal region. However, under the successive feudal rule and long-term imperialist aggression, especially under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, it became a poverty-stricken, backward, and disaster-prone area. The people's lives were extremely impoverished, and agricultural production was very backward. After liberation, under the correct leadership of the Party, the people of Zhanjiang area displayed a high degree of revolutionary enthusiasm and actively engaged in construction with their own diligent and brave hands, rapidly changing the face of this poor and backward area.
    Making Rivers Obey Human Commands
    The Zhanjiang Prefecture originally had extremely abundant rainfall, with an annual rainfall of up to 1,800 millimeters. However, in the past, due to the lack of water storage and conservation facilities, the river water flowed into the sea in vain, while the Leizhou Peninsula, Jianjiang Plain, Hepu Plain, and vast coastal areas within the region were so arid that even grass could not grow. Drought brought extreme suffering to the people of Zhanjiang Prefecture. Not to mention the distant past, but in 1943 alone, 12,000 people died of starvation in Maoming County alone due to disasters. The town of Lingshan, with a population of less than 5,000, collected 400 corpses from the Guoshi market within the town alone. These materials alone are enough to illustrate the tragic years people lived through in the past!
    Since liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the people of Zhanjiang Prefecture have continuously struggled to eliminate drought. By 1958, thanks to the three magic weapons of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, water conservancy construction entered a new stage. From 1958 to 1959, the Zhanjiang Prefecture implemented the principle of "run by the people with government assistance," relying on the superiority of the People's Communes, and completed the three large-scale water conservancy projects of the Hedi Reservoir, Liangde Reservoir, and Hepu Reservoir, achieving more, faster, better, and more economical results. Now, several major rivers in the region have obeyed people's commands and are serving the people obediently.
    On the Leizhou Peninsula, the Hedi Reservoir, the upstream project of the Youth Canal, subdued the Jiuzhou River, which had plagued the people of Leibei County, allowing the river water to flow into the sea from the east and west sides of the Leizhou Peninsula through the 178-kilometer-long "Youth Canal." This canal project is now 90% complete, and the northern section has already released water for spring plowing; after the canal is fully completed, it will benefit 2.5 million mu of land on the Leizhou Peninsula.
    The Liangde Reservoir was built on the Jianjiang Plain, cutting off the Liangde River, Shigou River, and Lingjiang River in the upper reaches of the Jianjiang River basin. Water weirs and flood diversion gates were built in the lower reaches, fundamentally controlling the flood damage of the Jianjiang River and realizing self-flowing irrigation for 1.1 million mu of arid land.
    After the Hepu Reservoir was built on the Hepu Plain, the Xiaojiang River in Hepu County runs along the 82-kilometer "Lake-Sea Canal" directly to Beihai City and into the sea, irrigating 2.1 million mu of arid land. In addition, the Moyang River in Liangyang County, the Qin River in Qin County, and the Mingke River in Lingshan County have all been rearranged. As a result of large-scale water conservancy projects, the irrigated area in the region has increased to 10.7 million mu, which is sixteen times that before liberation. The total cultivated area in the region is 15 million mu, and now 70% has been freed from the threat of waterlogging and drought. Due to the accumulation of these water management experiences, we are confident that in the next three years, we will comprehensively manage all 142 large and small rivers in the region, rapidly achieve the requirements of the National Agricultural Development Program for eliminating waterlogging and drought disasters, and realize the comprehensive utilization of drainage, irrigation, power generation, navigation, and aquaculture.
    Turning Barren Mountains into "Mountains of Treasures"
    Soil erosion in the Zhanjiang Prefecture is very serious. In the mountainous areas, except for a small portion of well-maintained forests, most of the mountains are bare. In the hilly and plain areas, due to the lack of fuel for the masses, pasture for livestock, and fertilizer for the land, the habit of burning mountain ash and scraping grass to solve the problem has led to vast areas of barren land. Therefore, marching towards bare mountains and wilderness has become a major event for the people of Zhanjiang Prefecture to transform nature; at the same time, afforestation is also necessary in coastal areas to resist wind and sand.
    In the past few years, especially since the Great Leap Forward, the method of combining mass campaigns with professional team management has been implemented, and the entire region has achieved great results in afforestation. In 1958 and 1959, the afforestation area reached 19.5 million mu, which is equal to 3.6 times the original forest area before liberation, and equal to 3.1 times the total afforestation area in the eight years after liberation. Afforestation has become a fashion among the Party, government, army, and people in Zhanjiang Prefecture. Every Spring Festival and Qingming Festival, the whole people take action to carry out afforestation campaigns. This year's Spring Festival, in just five or six days, the region afforested 7.21 million mu. Because Zhanjiang Prefecture has a mild climate and abundant rainfall, the trees planted can become forests in three years. Therefore, although the large-scale afforestation time is short, the natural landscape has undergone significant changes.
    Years of experience have proved that greening must be comprehensively planned and comprehensively managed. In coastal and gravel areas, Casuarina equisetifolia, which has been successfully trial-planted and has particularly strong vitality, should be promoted. In plains, hills, rivers, and villages, shelterbelts should be vigorously planted, and timber forests, fuel forests, water source forests, windbreak forests, economic forests, and fruit forests should be developed. In mountainous areas, tea and timber forests should be planted on the tops of high mountains, tropical and subtropical crops should be planted on the mountainsides, and food and economic crops should be planted at the foot of the mountains. In the early stage of young forests, intercropping of agriculture and forestry should be implemented, and crops such as Amomum villosum and coffee should be planted under the shade of the trees. The regionalization of mountain planting should be realized according to local conditions, such as timber forests, bamboo forests, medicinal material mountains, pineapple mountains, tea mountains, oil tea mountains, tung tree mountains, and fruit mountains, so that the mountains can be transformed into "mountains of treasures" that benefit the people.
    Attacking the Ocean
    In the vast coastal areas of Zhanjiang, wind, sand, sea waves, and tides have become the greatest threats to the development of production. Sea waves damage fertile land, sea sand buries villages, and typhoons threaten people's lives and property. However, after years of efforts, we can make the sea obediently serve industrial and agricultural production.
    The people in the coastal areas have dreamed for generations of one day being able to block the sea breeze, fix the shifting sand, and stop the erosion of seawater. However, "it is not easy to find a needle at the bottom of the sea, and it is even more difficult to plant trees on the beach." The people of Dianbai County expressed the helplessness of people in the past. Now, in the great Mao Zedong era, things that are more difficult than finding a needle at the bottom of the sea have also been solved. Brave and hardworking people have created miracles, and dense forests have appeared on the beaches. We have planted 512 kilometers of Casuarina equisetifolia windbreak forest belts along the coast. These forest belts protect against the erosion of sea sand, provide the people in the coastal areas with timber and fuel for daily use, improve the coastal climate, and green and beautify the coastal areas. As long as another year or two passes, the coastline of the Zhanjiang area can be completely greened.

    山河新造　征服海洋
    中共湛江地委第一书记　孟宪德
    湛江专区位于广东省的西南部，处在祖国大陆的最南端，背靠五岭山脉，面对辽阔的海洋，海岸线长达两千公里，有几百个大小不同的岛屿。全区现有耕地一千五百万亩，可耕荒地约八百万亩以上。
    湛江地区本来是一个富饶的滨海区。但是，在历代封建统治和帝国主义长期侵略，特别在国民党的反动统治下，却成为一个贫穷、落后、灾难频繁的重灾区。人民生活极端贫困，农业生产十分落后。解放后湛江地区人民，在党的正确领导下，发挥了高度的革命干劲，以自己勤劳勇敢的双手，积极进行建设，使这个贫穷落后的地区迅速改变了面貌。
    叫河流听人使唤
    湛江专区雨量原极丰富，年降雨量高达一千八百毫米。可是，过去由于缺乏蓄水、保水的水利设备，江河之水白白流入大海，而区内雷州半岛、鉴江平原、合浦平原以及沿海广大地区，却干旱得连草也长不起来。干旱带给湛江专区人民的苦难极为深重。远者不说，近者如1943年，因灾害饿死的仅茂名一县即达一万二千人。灵山县城是个不足五千人口的小镇，当时仅镇内果市一地，便收尸四百。只是这些材料，足够说明人们过去过的是怎样悲惨的岁月！
    解放以来，湛江专区人民在党的领导下，不断地为消灭干旱而斗争。到了1958年，由于有了总路线、大跃进、人民公社三大法宝，水利建设进入了一个新阶段。在1958年到1959年间，湛江专区实行了“民办公助”的方针，依靠人民公社的优越性，同时建成了鹤地水库、良德水库和合浦水库三项大型水利工程，做到多、快、好、省。现在，全区几条主要的大河流已经听从人们的使唤，驯服地为人民服务了。
    在雷州半岛上，青年运河上游工程——鹤地水库，制服了祸害雷北县人民的九州江，使江水通过全长一百七十八公里的“青年运河”，从雷州半岛的东西两面分流入海。这条运河工程现已完成90％，北段已放水供应春耕；运河全部建成后，可使雷州半岛二百五十万亩土地受益。
    在鉴江平原上建成了良德水库，把鉴江流域上游的良德河、石骨河和凌江拦腰斩断，下游又修好了水陂、分洪闸，根治了鉴江水害，并使一百一十万亩干旱土地实现了自流灌溉。
    在合浦平原上，合浦水库建成后，使合浦县的小江沿着八十二公里的“湖海运河”，直达北海市入海，二百一十万亩干旱土地获得灌溉。此外，还有两阳县的漠阳江、钦县的钦江、灵山县的鸣柯江，都已经重新作了安排。大兴水利的结果，全区灌溉面积增加到一千零七十万亩，为解放前的十六倍。全区耕地面积共为一千五百万亩，现在已有70％解除了水旱灾害的威胁。由于积累了这些治水经验，我们有信心在今后三年之内，全面地综合治理全区一百四十二条大小河流，迅速实现全国农业发展纲要关于消灭水旱灾害的要求，并且实现排灌、发电、航运、养殖综合利用。
    把荒山变成“万宝山”
    湛江专区水土流失是十分严重的。在山区，除了一部分林木保养较好以外，大部分是光山秃岭。在丘陵和平原地区，由于群众缺乏燃料，牲畜缺乏牧草，土地缺乏肥料，习惯烧山灰、铲草皮来解决，以致广大地区形成一望无际的不毛之地。因此向光山秃岭和荒野进军，成了湛江专区人民改造自然的一件大事；同时，为了抗御风沙，还要在沿海地区造林。
    几年来，特别是大跃进以来，实行了全民突击和专业队管理相结合的办法，全区造林获得了巨大的成绩。1958年和1959年，造林面积共达一千九百五十万亩，等于解放前原有林木面积的三点六倍，等于解放后八年造林面积总和的三点一倍。造林已经成为湛江专区党政军民的一种风尚。每当春节和清明，全民动手，突击造林。今年春节，只有五、六天时间，全区造林达七百二十一万亩。由于湛江专区气候温和，雨量充沛，所种树木能三年成林。因此，大规模造林的时间虽短，但自然面貌已经起了显著的变化。
    几年来的经验证明，绿化必须全面规划，综合治理。在沿海和砂砾地区，要推广已经试种成功的生命力特别强的木麻黄树。在平原、丘陵、河流、村庄，要大力种植防护林带，发展用材林、薪炭林、水源林、防风林、经济林和水果林等等。在山区要在高山顶上种茶、种用材林，在山腰种热带和亚热带作物，在山脚种粮食和经济作物。在幼林初期，实行农林兼种，在林荫树下种砂仁、咖啡等作物。要因地制宜的实现山地种植区域化，如木林山、材竹山、药材山、菠萝山、茶叶山、油茶山、桐树山、百果山，要把山变成为人们造福的“万宝山”。
    向海洋进攻
    湛江广大的沿海地区，风、沙、海浪和潮水，成为发展生产的最大威胁。海浪浸坏了良田，海沙埋没了村庄，台风威胁着人民的生命财产。但是，经过几年来的努力，我们可以使海驯服地为工农业生产服务了。
    沿海地区的人民，世世代代想着能有一天挡住海风，固定飞沙，制止海水的侵袭。可是，“海底摸针不容易，海滩种树更艰难。”电白县的人民道出了过去人们的无可奈何的心情。现在，在伟大的毛泽东时代，比海底摸针更困难的事情也迎刃而解了。勇敢而勤劳的人民创造了奇迹，海滩上出现了茂密的丛林。我们在沿海已经种植了长达五百一十二公里的木麻黄树防风林带。这些林带，既防护了海沙的侵袭，又可供给沿海地区人民日用的木材和薪炭；既可改善沿海的气候，又绿化美化了滨海地区。只要再过一两年，湛江区的海岸线就可以全部绿化起来。
