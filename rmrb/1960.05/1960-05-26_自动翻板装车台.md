    Automatic Tilting Truck Loader
    Employees of the Juya Gully Forest Farm of the Tulihe Forestry Bureau in Inner Mongolia have successfully created an automatic tilting truck loader. Using the automatic tilting truck loader allows the three processes of harvesting, collecting, and transporting to be connected, reducing the intermediate sorting process in the mountain area. It enables the timber felled to be directly loaded onto trucks and transported to the storage yard after a small-scale concentration, forming a continuous production line and increasing production efficiency by 67%. It also greatly reduces loading time; in the past, loading a row of cars took an hour, but now it only takes five minutes. Moreover, it is not limited by seasons or weather and can operate year-round.
    The structure of the automatic tilting truck loader is very simple. First, a pile of logs is erected with wood, and then an automatic tilting platform is installed near the road. The track of the material-collecting flatcar from the mountain extends to the loader. The timber is loaded onto the tilting platform. After the truck drives in and aligns with the position, the tilting platform gate lever is pulled. The tilting platform starts to tilt due to the loss of the fulcrum and the effect of gravity. When a certain degree is reached, the switch is automatically opened, and the timber is automatically flipped onto the truck.

    自动翻板装车台
    内蒙古图里河林业局桔亚沟林场职工，创造成功了自动翻板装车台。使用自动翻板装车台，可使采、集、运三道工序互相衔接起来，减少了山场中的中楞工序，使采伐下来的木材小集中后直接装车运到贮木场，构成了一条连续生产作业线，提高生产效率67％；同时还大大缩减了装车时间；过去装一排车需要一小时，现在只要五分钟。而且，不受季节和天气的限制，可以常年作业。
    自动翻板装车台的构造很简单，先用木头架起一个马莲垛，然后在靠近公路的地方安装自动翻板，山上的集材平车轨道一直铺到装车台，把木材装在翻板上，汽车开进来对好位置后，拉动翻板闸杆，翻板因失去支点靠重力作用开始倾斜，达到一定程度时开关器自动打开，木材就自动地翻转到汽车上了。
