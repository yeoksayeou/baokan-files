    Improve Working Methods, Improve Management Systems, Promote Production Leaps
    The First Automobile Factory's Major Reform of Management Operations
    More Than 60 New Systems Established Based on Workers' Extensive Participation in Management
    (Our Dispatch from Changchun, May 21st) The various functional departments of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, based on worker management groups, have launched a mass movement to reform various management operations, creating a whole set of working methods and management systems adapted to the rapid development of productive forces. At present, the factory has established more than 60 new systems in production management, technical management, and economic management, such as "mass dispatching," "ten thousand people statistics," "mass accounting," and "three-way combination inside and outside the factory, comprehensive large-scale collaboration." These new systems have vigorously promoted the in-depth development of the technical revolution movement and the sustained leap forward in automobile production.
    A distinct characteristic of this management reform in various business departments of the First Automobile Factory is: "Where the Party's central task is, the center of business work is there." Each functional unit, around the central task and based on different work characteristics, proposed specific measures and launched a mass movement within the business system to promote production. Planning, economics, production scheduling, technical inspection, safety, and other units, based on worker management groups, convened multiple worker management conferences, representative meetings, and on-site meetings of various business systems to deploy tasks, followed by a series of mass activities such as large-scale competitions, large-scale inspections, large-scale evaluations, and large-scale exchanges. The planning and accounting system, relying on more than 1,000 worker accountants in the factory, cooperated with relevant departments in finance, technology, and other systems to provide information. All departments and units worked together to carry out the mass movement of "ten thousand people statistics," ensuring that hundreds of economic results were: timely, accurate, and comprehensive statistics, reflecting the daily achievements on the same day. In the past, the central tool warehouse was managed in a busy and chaotic manner by dozens of people. Recently, workers established a "tool storage area map," with eight workers managing 30,000 types of 3.6 million tools, issuing them as needed with ease. The average issuing time for each tool has been shortened from several tens of minutes to two or three minutes. The supply system has realized the four diligences (diligent checking, diligent calculation, diligent communication, diligent research) and five knowledges (knowing inventory, knowing work-in-progress, knowing the number of missing materials, knowing the steel plant's production arrangements for missing materials, knowing the steel plant's material dispatching situation) and seven speeds (solving missing materials quickly, handling substitutions quickly, unloading quickly, acceptance quickly, inspection quickly, stacking quickly, material delivery quickly) and other management measures proposed in the movement, so that management work truly plays a role in guiding the movement in a timely manner and inspiring morale.
    In the movement, the various business departments changed their past simple and perfunctory handling of problems, completing them within a limited time, without discussing ideology or the significance, and gradually learned to carry out business work by starting with political and ideological work. The design department formed a promotion team of more than 100 designers with a target output of 250 vehicles per shift, frequently using various forms such as exhibitions, on-site meetings, reports, and small concerts to seize the vivid examples of workers participating in product design, publicize the great significance of product revolution to workers, and help workers deeply understand product design and put forward more and better suggestions. Together with the workers, they spent two months surveying eleven workshops, thirty-one work sections, and three cooperating factories. While ensuring quality, they reformed more than 5,000 parts, accounting for 60% of the entire vehicle. The production capacity of the improved parts generally increased by one to two times, with the highest reaching seven times.
    The First Automobile Factory also improved its rules and regulations in the movement. Based on the many rich management experiences created in the past two years of the Great Leap Forward, and adhering to the principle of "from the masses, to the masses," they adopted mass movement forms such as large-scale exchanges, large-scale integration, and large-scale exhibitions to organize and match various management experiences, summarize and improve them, and at the same time promote and affirm more than 170 advanced management experiences through the method of side-by-side competition, promotion, and construction. More than 60 relatively complete management systems have been established in production management, technical management, and experience management, laying the foundation for establishing a new type of socialist enterprise management system. These systems reflect the policy of relying on Party committees, all levels of organization, and the broad masses of employees to manage enterprises well and develop production in a faster, better, and more economical way. There is both centralized leadership and decentralized management; both unity and flexibility. With the deepening development of the movement, the "three-way combination" system has been more widely used and has new developments. In the past, it was mostly reflected in the combination of veteran technicians, technical personnel, and leading cadres, but now it has developed to the point where female workers, young workers, and apprentices can all participate in the three-way combination, and there is a three-way combination at any time. In the past, the three-way combination was mainly used in design, but now it has developed to the point where工艺, equipment manufacturing, worker technicians work together on manufacturing, installation, and adjustment, and the combination goes all the way through from beginning to end. At the same time, the in-plant three-way combination has rapidly developed into a three-way combination with external units. The factory has now established regular cooperative relationships with more than 20 units, including Jilin University of Technology, Shenyang Institute of Technology, Tsinghua University in Beijing, Shandong Institute of Technology, and the Semiconductor Research Institute.
    At present, the management work of the First Automobile Factory has developed to the point where it is connected from top to bottom and combined vertically and horizontally, forming a relatively complete mass management network. Even in situations with heavy tasks and many problems, various tasks can be handled thoroughly without omissions, busy without chaos, and in an orderly manner, giving full play to the active role of functional units.

    改进工作方法  改进管理制度  促进生产跃进
    第一汽车厂管理业务大改革
    在工人广泛参加管理的基础上建立了六十多套新制度
    本报长春21日电　第一汽车制造厂各职能部门以工人管理小组为基础，掀起了改革各项管理业务的群众运动，已创造出一整套适应生产力高速发展的工作方法和管理制度。目前这个工厂已建立起“群众调度”、“万人统计”、“群众核算”以及“厂内外三结合，全面大协作”等六十多套新的生产管理、技术管理、经济管理等方面的制度。这些新制度有力地促进了技术革命运动的深入发展和汽车生产的持续跃进。
    第一汽车厂各业务部门这次改革管理业务的鲜明特点是：“党的中心任务在那里，业务工作中心就在那里”。各职能单位围绕中心任务，根据不同的工作特点，提出具体措施，在业务系统内开展群众运动，促进生产。计划、经济、生产调度、技术检查、安全等单位，都在工人管理小组基础上召开了多次各业务系统工人管理大会、代表会、现场会布置任务，随后又展开大竞赛、大检查、大评比、大交流等一系列群众性的活动。计划会计系统，依靠全厂一千多名工人核算员，与财会、技术等系统有关部门协作配合，提供资料，条条块块，一齐动手，开展“万人统计”的群众运动，使上百项的经济效果都做到了：统计及时、准确、全面，当日战果当日反映出来。中央工具库过去几十个人管得又忙又乱，最近工人建立“工具存放区位图”，八个工人管三万种三百六十万件工具，随要随发，得心应手；每件工具平均发放时间从几十分钟缩短到两三分钟。供应系统已经实现他们在运动中提出的四勤（勤查、勤算、勤联系、勤研究），五知（知库存、知在制品、知缺料数、知钢厂对缺料生产安排情况、知钢厂材料发出情况），七快（解决缺料快、办理代用快、卸车快、验收快、检查快、码垛快、送料快）等管理措施，使管理工作真正起到了及时指导运动和鼓舞斗志的作用。
    在运动中，各业务部门转变了过去在处理问题时简单草率，限期完成，不谈思想，不讲意义的单纯业务观点，逐渐学会从政治思想工作入手开展业务工作。设计部门组成了一个由一百多名设计人员参加的班产二百五十辆促进大队，经常运用展览会、现场会、报告会、小演唱等各种形式，抓住工人参加产品设计的生动事例，向工人宣传产品革命的重大意义，帮助工人深入了解产品设计，提出更多更好的建议。他们和工人一道，用两个月时间就普查了十一个车间三十一个工部和三个协作厂。在保证质量的前提下，对占整个汽车60％的五千多个零件，作了改革。改进后的零件生产能力普遍提高产量一至二倍，最高的达到七倍。
    第一汽车厂还在运动中改进了规章制度。根据在过去两年大跃进中创造的许多丰富的管理经验，本着“从群众中来，到群众中去”的原则，采用大交流，大集成，大展览等群众运动形式，将各方面的管理经验组织配套，总结提高，同时以边竞赛、边推广、边建设的办法，推广和肯定了一百七十多项先进管理经验。在生产管理、技术管理、经验管理等方面建立起六十多套比较完整的管理制度，奠定了建立新型的社会主义企业管理制度的基础。这些制度体现了在党委领导下，依靠各级组织和广大职工管好企业和多快好省地发展生产的方针。既有集中领导，又有分级管理；既有统一性，又有灵活性。随着运动的深入发展，“三结合”制度又有了更广泛的运用和新的发展。过去多数表现在老技工、技术人员和领导干部的结合，现在已经发展到女工、青工、徒工都可参加三结合，随时都有三结合。过去主要在设计方面采用三结合，现在发展到工艺、设备制造、工人技术员一起搞制造、安装、调整，一直结合到底，有始有终。与此同时，厂内三结合又迅速发展到与厂外单位三结合。现在全厂已与吉林工业大学、沈阳工学院、北京清华大学、山东工学院、半导体研究所等二十多个单位建立了经常的协作关系。
    目前第一汽车厂的管理工作，已发展到上下串联，纵横结合，形成了比较完整的群众性管理网。即使在任务重、问题多的情况下，也能使各项任务繁而不漏，忙而不乱，秩序井然，充分发挥了职能单位的能动作用。
