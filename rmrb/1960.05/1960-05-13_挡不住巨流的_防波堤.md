    The "Breakwater" That Can't Stop the Torrent
    Chen Jiuren
    More than half a century ago, the then-famous Japanese literary theorist, Hakuson Kuriyagawa, in an article denouncing European and American anti-Semitism and racial discrimination, said indignantly: "If discrimination reaches an extreme, it becomes ridiculously laughable. In the southern United States, discrimination against black people is carried out to the point that signs saying 'No blacks allowed' are written on everything from train stations to streetcar carriages to differentiate them from white people. In the past, in the summer resort of Karuizawa, American missionaries put up signs on their athletic fields with such bastard words as 'No Japanese allowed'. However, in the West, regarding this kind of discrimination against Jews, in the bustling summer resorts, there is also this blunt sentence: 'No lung patients, dogs, or Jews allowed.'" In fact, those Americans at that time brought the "Bible" to the foot of Mount Fuji to spread the gospel. One can imagine that the words of equality, fraternity, humanity, and justice that they uttered were very pleasant and charming. Compared with the crimes committed by today's American soldiers in Japan, who are armed to the teeth and committing all kinds of evil deeds, they were truly "civilized"! However, a sign that read "No Japanese allowed" aroused Hakuson Kuriyagawa's indignation. Only half a century later, the sacred homeland has been reduced to the defense works of the American army, and the beautiful mountains and rivers have become the foreigners' arsenal—atomic and rocket bases! One can imagine how Hakuson Kuriyagawa, if he knew this in the afterlife, would scold those few slaves—traitors—who are willing to be led by the nose by others!
    "Even children can understand by looking at the map that our Japan is providing military service to the United States, which is far across the Pacific Ocean, and is in a state of hostility with neighboring Asian countries. This unnatural state of tension has continued for fourteen years and is still continuing." (See page 1 of the "Handbook for Criticizing the Security Treaty" attached to the November 1959 issue of the Japanese magazine "Sekai")
    Yes, even a child can recognize the star-studded marks of the U.S. military bases on the map; the Japanese people know that the root cause is the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."
    Writer Takeo Kōga pointed out in an article that, up to now, all the large and small incidents that have occurred during the U.S. military occupation are related to the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," "...various bloody incidents that have occurred throughout the country between Japanese and Americans, and between Japanese and Japanese, cannot but be said to have been caused by the 'Security Treaty'." The Japanese people's resolute demand to abolish this disastrous treaty is just and therefore has won the support of the people of all countries, especially Asian countries; however, the slaves who betray the nation are always loyal to their foreign masters.
    Nobusuke Kishi said: "Judging from Japan's geographical location and national strength, a neutral policy is not feasible."
    The U.S. Secretary of Defense said: "Japan is our breakwater."
    A prime minister who sells out national interests and an arrogant soldier could not have made the relationship between Japan and the United States any clearer.
    Traveling thousands of miles across the ocean to establish "national defense" on other people's land, calling it common "security" and "defense," seems like a good calculation for the master; however, history has proven that a "breakwater" built with conspiracies cannot stop the torrent of the times. We have heard the roar from the foot of Mount Fuji, and we have heard the footsteps of the Japanese people marching forward. Historically, no nation has been able to tolerate foreign enslavement for a long time, and no reactionary force in the world can extinguish the flames of anger!

    挡不住巨流的“防波堤”
    陈九仁
    半个多世纪以前，当时日本著名文艺理论家厨川白村在一篇斥责欧洲和美国排犹、种族歧视的文章中愤慨地说：“差别待遇如果到了极端，真有令人不禁失笑那样的滑稽。在美国南部的排斥黑人，从车站到电车车厢，都写着‘不许黑人进去’的字样而与白人区别开来。从前在轻井泽的避暑地方，美国传教师们把自己的运动场挂上牌子，上面有‘不许日本人进去’那样的混蛋话。然而在西洋，关于这种对犹太人的差别待遇，在夏季的热闹场所，则还有这样煞脱的句子呢：‘肺病患者和狗和犹太人不准进去’。”其实，那时的美国佬是带着“圣经”到富士山麓传布福音的，可以想见，挂在嘴上的平等、博爱、人道、正义……的字眼动听而迷人得很，比起今天荷枪实弹的美国大兵在日本干的那些为非作歹的罪恶勾当，可真“文明”得多！然而一块“不许日本人进去”的牌子，激起厨川白村的义愤。才半个多世纪之后，神圣的国土竟沦为美国军队的防御工事，大好山河成了外人的火药库——原子、火箭基地！可以设想一下，厨川白村地下有知，将怎样痛骂那一小撮甘心让别人牵着鼻子走的奴才——卖国贼！
    “看看地图孩子都会明白的，我们日本为远在太平洋彼岸的美国在军事上效力，而与邻近的亚洲大陆各国处于敌对关系，这种不自然的紧张状态已经继续十四年了，而至今仍在继续。”（见日本“世界”杂志1959年11月号附发的“安全条约批判手册”第一页）
    是的，一个孩子都会认得，地图上星罗棋布的美军基地标记；日本人民知道，其祸根就是日美“安全条约”。
    作家开高健在一篇文章指出，到目前为止，在美军占领期间发生的大大小小事件，无不与日美“安全条约”有关，“……全国各地发生的日本人对美国人，日本人对日本人之间的各种各样的流血事件，不能不说是由‘安全条约’引起的。”日本人民坚决要求废除这个带来灾难的条约的斗争，是正义的，因而获得各国、特别是亚洲各国人民的声援和支持；但是，背叛民族的奴才从来是忠于外国主子的。
    岸信介说：“从日本的地理位置和国力来说，中立政策是不能成立的。”
    美国的国防部长说：“日本是我们的防波堤。”
    一个出卖民族利益的首相和一个狂妄的军人把日美两国的关系说得再清楚也没有了。
    万里迢迢，远越重洋，把“国防”建立在别人的国土上，名之曰共同的“安全”、“防御”，对主子说来，看来是如意算盘；但是，用阴谋构成的“防波堤”，历史证明，是决阻挡不住时代巨流的。我们听到了富士山麓的怒吼，我们听到了日本人民前进的脚步声。历史上没有一个民族能够长期容忍异族的奴役，世界上没有任何反动力量能够扑灭愤怒的火焰！
