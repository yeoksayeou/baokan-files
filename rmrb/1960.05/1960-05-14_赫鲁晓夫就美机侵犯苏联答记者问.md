Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 12th, TASS Dispatch: On May 11th, after attending the press conference held by Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko, Soviet and foreign journalists were invited to visit the wreckage of the downed American plane on display at the Gorky Central Culture and Rest Park in Moscow. While touring the exhibition, the journalists encountered Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers Khrushchev, who had already visited the airplane wreckage exhibition, talked with experts, and was preparing to leave. The journalists surrounded Khrushchev and began talking with him.

The journalists expressed satisfaction that they had the opportunity to see the plane wreckage and the plane's equipment and specialized instruments.

Khrushchev said, "I see that you are very satisfied with the press conference. The questions that interested you have probably been answered. I have already said that we intend to submit the issue of the American plane's intrusion into Soviet airspace to the Security Council. It seems that the United States will exert pressure on the Security Council, and if the Security Council is therefore unable to pass a correct resolution, then we will submit this issue to the United Nations General Assembly. This aggressive action by the United States is a very dangerous phenomenon.

The danger is deepened by the following: U.S. Secretary of State Herter, in his statement on May 9, not only defended the aggressive acts that have already been committed, but also said that the U.S. government intends to continue such flights in the future. This is a direct threat to peace. We will shoot down such planes and will strike the bases from which the planes that violate our country take off. You yourselves know that if these aggressive actions continue, then this may lead to war."

"May I ask you a question?" a reporter said to Khrushchev.

Khrushchev: "You can even ask two questions." (Animated)

"You probably saw a poster among the plane wreckage that read 'Request assistance for the pilot.' What do you think the author of this poster meant to say?"

Khrushchev: "When the pilot flew to us, we gave him assistance and ensured that he received proper treatment. If there are other uninvited guests who want to come, we will treat them with the same 'hospitality' as this time. We will conduct interrogations and will strictly interrogate them as spies."

"What impact will all of this have on the summit conference?"

Khrushchev: "Let those who dispatched this reconnaissance plane consider these things. In fact, they should have considered the consequences before this. You must understand that this was an aggression against our country. In the future, we will eliminate all those who dare to violate us. You see how careful our rocket operators were when they hit the plane: it was hit without catching fire! The pilot is alive, the instruments are intact, in short, there is complete material evidence. This is the brilliance of our rocket operators. Special thanks to them for this." (Animated, applause)

"Mr. Eisenhower is going to come to Moscow. Will this plane incident have any impact on Soviet public opinion?"

Khrushchev: "I would not want to be in the situation that President Eisenhower is in. I would not want to receive the questions that might be asked of him when Eisenhower comes to the Soviet Union! All I can say is that the Soviet people and our social figures are very polite, so there will be no excessive behavior, but questions will be asked of the President." (Animated, laughter)

"I can say this: In this regard, one person has been particularly helpful to the President, and that is Mr. Herter.

Herter made a robber's statement at his press conference! He not only does not feel guilty or ashamed of the aggressive actions, but also defends these actions, saying that they will continue in the future. Only countries that are at war do this. We are not at war with the United States now. These aggressive actions and Herter's statement are brazen, brazen!

Herter's statement makes us doubt the correctness of our past conclusion that the American President did not know about this flight and that the American government did not know about this flight. Herter's statement precisely shows that this reconnaissance plan was approved by the American government. It seems that the Americans had to make such a statement, because otherwise Allen Dulles would have to be prosecuted. And Dulles would also expose the government, he would say that he was implementing a plan approved by the government, that is, implementing a plan approved by the head of government. I am basing this on Herter's statement.

In the past, I remember when I was young, there were many criminal, undocumented, and other kinds of suspicious people wandering around. This group of people used the following method: a good person was walking on a path, crossing a small bridge; a robber was sitting under the bridge, with a boy. The robber sent the boy to the passerby, and the child said: Sir, please give me my watch. The person said: What's going on? Get out of here! The child replied: What's going on, uncle, isn't the watch mine? Why don't you give me back my watch? In the midst of the argument, the armed robber walked over and said to the passerby: Why are you bullying the child, give him his watch, and take off your coat too!" (Laughter)

The United States wants to live according to this kind of law. But we are not passersby without the ability to defend ourselves. Our country is a strong and powerful country, capable of competing with it. If the United States has not seen a real war on its own territory, has not seen bombs, if they want to provoke a war, then we will be forced to send rockets to them, and the rockets will reach the land of the aggressors within the first few minutes." (Applause)

I say this because I read Herter's statement. He said: We were forced to fly; we flew because of the Soviet Union's own fault, because it does not allow us to know its secrets, and we must know the secrets of the Soviet Union. He said, therefore we fly; you must know that the President said that the skies must be open: so we fly and will continue to fly—to open the skies.

How can an official of one country speak to another country like this! We do not live according to American laws. We have our own laws, so we will make everyone respect our laws on our territory. We will strike at all those who violate our laws!" (Applause)

I really liked an article in the British "Daily Worker," the gist of which is this: If we accept the kind of philosophy that some people in the United States want to instill in the public, then things would probably be like this: a thief who pried open the lock of a room is caught, but it turns out that it is not the fault of the thief who pried open the lock, but the fault of the owner who locked the door, because he forced the thief to try to pry open the lock and steal into someone else's house.

But this is a robber's, a bandit's philosophy!

I believe that if world public opinion correctly understands the seriousness of the situation and responsibly treats this act of aggression manifested in American policy, and if everyone unanimously condemns this behavior and the United States no longer adopts this kind of method towards other countries in the future, then this will be a very good coolant, it can be said to be a disinfectant in the relations between countries.

In the past few days, while reading the news published in the American press, I saw that, in addition to those openly bandit-like writers who defend this behavior, the vast majority of people who publish articles in American newspapers (including those who were formerly known for being unobjective) are indignant at this fact, believing that this is a treacherous act towards the Soviet Union. This is a good sign. Journalists, if you report correctly to the public, then this incident, like any other incident, will eventually be "digested." After all, we should live together peacefully, gentlemen, not only peacefully, but also in a friendly manner." (Applause)

"Is it still possible to be optimistic about American policy?"

Khrushchev: "I consider myself an incorrigible optimist. I don't think the provocative flight of the American reconnaissance plane over our country is a preparation for war, but a probe. They have 'probed' us, but we gave those 'probers' a bloody nose. Now, some people in the United States are making a lot of noise. It doesn't matter, let them make noise! Because the Soviet Union is not Guatemala. They can't send troops to fight us. If they want to use their despicable tricks against us, we have medicine to calm them down properly. If they want to do that, then what they will get are these tranquilizers."

"Mr. Khrushchev, has your assessment of Eisenhower changed since you returned from the United States?"

Khrushchev: "You must understand that the statement issued by the U.S. State Department on the reconnaissance plane issue certainly changes my view that the American President was not involved in this matter. I did not know in the past that the United States had formulated this reconnaissance plan, which included reconnaissance flights over Soviet territory. It was only from the U.S. State Department's statement, which was approved by the President, that I understood that the American reconnaissance plane flying over our country was not the recklessness of some irresponsible officer, but the execution of a plan formulated by Allen Dulles, the head of the Central Intelligence Agency, an agency under the jurisdiction of the American President.

Mr. Herter also admitted that the American President had ordered the collection of all kinds of intelligence by all possible means. Based on these instructions, plans were formulated and executed. According to Herter, these plans include the use of aircraft and extensive observation from the air through infiltration. I ask you to pay attention to this—through infiltration, that is, carrying out reconnaissance and espionage flights everywhere on the territory of a country with which it has normal relations. And this plan was approved by the President. It's unheard of! After this situation, if I should still say, how lovely you are! Doing so would be equivalent to disrespecting myself. I want to say that Mr. Herter has taken off all the veils and wiped away all the paints, and these things—if I may say so—were originally used to disguise, conceal, and beautify the policies of American imperialism. In his speech, he revealed a frightening militaristic fang. What is that? Now it seems that this fang is not scary. This action by American militarists is not due to the heroism of their prompters, but to cowardice. What is dangerous is not the person who can control his nerves and rely on his own strength and possibilities, but the coward who is afraid of everything.

I often read the words: According to Khrushchev, capitalism will inevitably perish. Is that why reconnaissance flights are being carried out against the Soviet Union? But you must know that this was not said by me, but was argued by Marx as early as a hundred years ago." (Animated, applause)

"Did the Turkish, Pakistani, and Norwegian authorities know about the American plane's provocative flight?"

Khrushchev: "It is difficult for me to speak for these governments, but I assume that they did not know, the Americans did not report it to them. Presumably the prime ministers of countries with American military bases are not even allowed to go to these bases." (Animated)

The fault of countries such as Turkey, Pakistan, and other countries lies in their joining aggressive blocs. This situation, in folk terms, is that a person sells his soul to the devil; when he has not yet sold his soul, he can control himself, but later his soul is controlled by the devil. The situation of Turkey, Pakistan, and Norway is also like this now." (Animated)

I warn you, foreign journalists, do not sell your souls to the devil (laughter), keep it on your own body. It is best to dedicate your work to the progressive development of society. The ideology of communism has determined the most progressive and correct direction of social development. Some excellent Americans, such as John Reed, the author of "Ten Days That Shook the World," understood the great significance of these ideas. John Reed was an extremely talented person. He was not born a Communist, but accepted communism during the October Revolution, and he died as a Communist.

Some of you often write articles attacking communism due to a lack of reason and insufficient understanding. May God forgive you for doing so." (Animated, applause)

When I read bourgeois journalists' slanders of the true situation in the Soviet Union, of communism, I sometimes feel angry, but then I think that not all journalists are John Reed. You must know that these are ordinary people, employed by publishing institutions such as Hearst Publishing, companies that grab people like spiders and wrap them in their webs. If such a journalist does not write things that slander communism, then why would Hearst or other publishing concerns keep him? Hearst would not feed such a journalist for a single day.

I spoke with Hearst twice. During the second conversation, I said to him: You say one thing to me, but you write another, what's going on? He replied: Didn't I explain the content of the conversation correctly? He should be properly evaluated - he explained the content of the conversation more or less correctly, but published commentaries that distorted the entire idea of the conversation. I talked to him about this, and he replied: Because I am a capitalist, I publish my own comments (animated). He is a capitalist, and most of you are not capitalists, and will never become capitalists. Then why do you serve capitalism? Why do you act as capitalism's running dogs?" (Applause) I firmly believe that all roads lead to communism. Where else can they lead?!

American imperialists are precisely afraid of this. Therefore, they are nervous and take reckless adventures. This shows that they do not believe in their own system. The U.S. State Department's statement said: All countries are engaged in espionage. However, the Soviet Union has never sent its own planes to the United States or other countries for reconnaissance, neither in the past nor now. If, in individual cases, our planes accidentally violated the airspace of other countries (this was on the border with Turkey and Iran), then we have apologized to these countries and punished those who carried out such violations.

We want to warn those who attempt to send their spies to our country in the future to carefully consider the consequences.

"Do you still hope that President Eisenhower will visit the Soviet Union?"

Khrushchev: "What would you say to this? Put yourself in my place and answer it for me (laughter). You yourselves can see what kind of difficulties have arisen. I am speaking frankly to you. You know my attitude towards the American President, I have repeatedly said this. But my hopes have not been realized to some extent. I am a person, I have human feelings, and I am responsible for leading the work of the Soviet government. You must understand that we Russians, Soviets, have frank minds—we walk when we say we'll walk, and we fight when we say we'll fight. How can I now ask our people to come out to welcome him, how can I tell them that the person who is coming to visit is a distinguished guest? People will say that you are crazy, because what kind of distinguished guest is someone who approved the dispatch of spy planes. American militarists sent planes to our country to engage in espionage activities, they have put me, the person responsible for preparing the American President's visit to the Soviet Union, in a very embarrassing situation. Frankly speaking, I think the American President himself understands this.

Imagine, if we had sent this kind of plane to the United States before my visit to the United States, and the plane was shot down there, you can imagine how the Americans would treat me. As the saying goes, greet according to merit. I think everyone understands this.

But it can be guaranteed that there will be no excessive actions during the President's visit. Our people are polite, they only speak verbally, and let the government take action, and no insulting behavior is allowed. I think American journalists and travelers are now feeling the self-restraint and discipline of the Soviet people. I have not heard anyone say anything insulting to Americans. This is commendable. This shows the spiritual strength of our people.

"Will the issue of this plane flight be a subject of discussion at the summit conference?"

Khrushchev: "It is already a subject of discussion all over the world. Therefore, I do not think that this issue must be included on the agenda of the meeting. We take into account that I am the only one representing socialist countries, while there are three representatives representing Western countries. But I don't think that two of these three representatives will agree with this dangerous aggressive action by American warmongers.

Obviously, everyone is interested in when I plan to fly to Paris. I plan to go to Paris on May 14, that is, one or even two days before the start of the meeting, in order to get used to the environment a little. I like Paris, it is a beautiful city." (Animated) But if others don't come (I say this because some people are threatening that the meeting may not be held), then everyone will understand that the meeting is not being held due to our fault. That's why we are going to Paris! What if the meeting is not held? So what, we have lived all these years without it, and we will live another hundred years." (Laughter, applause)

The meeting is not only in our interests, but also in the interests of the whole world. The people of the whole world expect the easing of international tension and hope for the normalization of relations between countries. I think the summit conference is in the interests of our negotiating partners no less than it is in the interests of the Soviet Union. Therefore, the meeting will depend on our negotiating partners. We are prepared. I repeat again, I am prepared to fly to Paris on Saturday, May 14.

It is said that some diplomats complain about me, saying that Khrushchev's wording is too sharp. I would like to hear what their reaction would be if their country suffered a similar aggressive violation?! Should I take off my hat to welcome this violation?! No, we must treat thieves in the proper way. This is an attack by robbers and bandits." (Applause)

Did you see the "air sampling instrument" here?" (Laughter) After this statement is exposed, what kind of eyes can the person who said this use to see? Yes, we know what kind of eyes the imperialists have. As the saying goes, people spit in their eyes, and they say it is God's nectar." (Laughter, applause)

Now you see, at the meeting of the Supreme Soviet, I deliberately did not say everything in my report, because we know who we are dealing with. At first, we didn't say that the pilot was alive, the instruments were intact, the plane didn't explode, etc. So they thought that the pilot had committed suicide. But now, when he is still alive, the American newspapers are severely condemning him because the pilot violated the instructions, did not commit suicide, but surrendered.

Some people in the United States say that the pilot should be tried because he did not complete the instructions and did not commit suicide. This is a beastly argument. This is imperialist ideology. You, American journalists, have you read your newspapers? This is really appalling.

"Did the American Chargé d'Affaires ask you to meet with Powers?"

Khrushchev: "The Americans sent a note about this, asking us to allow him to meet. But they themselves understand that this is too much. The pilot is under investigation, you must know that he is a spy. How can we meet with him now? He should be tried by our Soviet court."

"Does this mean that neither the ambassador nor the chargé d'affaires will be allowed to meet with Powers?"

Khrushchev: "I didn't say that. We will make the decision ourselves. Maybe they can meet, maybe they can't meet. I can't answer this question now, because an investigation is underway."

"Will you consider that after the conclusion of a peace treaty with East Germany, the flights of Western planes to Berlin would be an act of aggression?"

Khrushchev: "We have already issued a statement on this issue. I repeat again, after the conclusion of a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic, the situation stipulated by the terms prescribed for this territory due to military surrender will change. From then on, the state of occupation of West Berlin will end, and all passages to Berlin obtained under the German surrender will cease to be open from this time on. At that time, the German Democratic Republic will completely control its territory and the passages to West Berlin located within its territory. If the German Democratic Republic reaches an agreement with the countries concerned allowing them to use space, waterways, railways, and highways, then this is no longer our business, but the business of the German Democratic Republic. This is its sovereignty.

Some people say that Western countries will use force to break into West Berlin. I want to make it clear: If anyone dares to use force to break in, then our troops stationed in the German Democratic Republic to maintain peace will also use force to deal with the peace-breakers, and let the Westerners who like to think about it consider what consequences this will have for them.

"In view of this plane incident and your attitude towards President Eisenhower, would you prefer that Eisenhower's visit be postponed?"

Khrushchev: "On this issue, we will exchange views with the President when we meet in Paris. We hope, as in the past, to find ways to improve relations with the United States, and we hope to have normal relations with the United States. We believe that Soviet-American relations will develop into friendly relations between the two peoples in the future. This will be normal, and all normal people now and in the future hope so.

Any more questions?"

Someone shouted: "No more. Thank you." (Unanimous applause)

Khrushchev: "Finally, I would like to say the following. We will severely deal with those who violate our borders and violate our sovereignty. But we hope to live in peace and friendship with the people of all countries. Gentlemen, please understand our situation when we angrily condemn this aggressive activity. But we look at the situation soberly and clearly understand that all disputes, even the most acute disputes, are better than war. Therefore, we will do everything possible to 'digest' the current acute situation, and do everything possible to put the international situation on the right track and restore good relations with the United States, of course, if the United States will also promote this.

Therefore, I ask you to take this into account and not write anything that will make the situation more acute and more tense. Why should you do this? You must know that if a war breaks out, it will not be good for you either." (Applause) War will not bring happiness to anyone.

In recent days, I have read many speeches by American congressmen and business figures, many of whom have condemned the government's behavior, and I think this is a good sign. I think a good omen is that people have not lost their minds, and not everyone interprets this matter like Herter.

"Since you are going to visit Paris, what are your wishes for the French people?"

Khrushchev: "I don't want to put one country's people against another country's people. The French people received me as hospitably as the American people. However, I went to France later, so the impressions are newer. I am not only very satisfied with the French people's reception of me, but also very satisfied with my conversations with French President de Gaulle. There is nothing to say about the people. All the people want peace. Wars are started by governments, and the people have to bleed. Therefore, they all want peace.

The French people also want peace. We fought together with France against militaristic Germany. If a war breaks out—it may be launched by West Germany—then the French know that they once had a good ally—the Soviet Union. This ally will be good for them again. But it is best that we work together to prevent war and become allies in the struggle for peace.

I think this unexpected press conference can be ended. Thank you, dear comrades and gentlemen, and wish you success. If you uphold the truth and safeguard the noble cause of peace, then you will be respected by the people of your country." (Unanimous applause. Someone shouted: "Thank you!")

Khrushchev: "Finally, I want to say the following. We must deal severely with those who violate our borders and violate our sovereignty. But we hope to live in peace and friendship with the peoples of all countries. Gentlemen, when we angrily condemn this aggression, please understand our situation. But we look at the situation soberly and clearly understand that all disputes, even the most acute disputes, are better than war. Therefore, we will do everything possible to 'digest' the current acute situation and do everything possible to put the international situation on the right track and restore good relations with the United States, of course, if the United States will also promote this.

### 赫鲁晓夫就美机侵犯苏联答记者问

专栏：

    赫鲁晓夫就美机侵犯苏联答记者问
    新华社13日讯　塔斯社莫斯科12日讯：5月11日，苏联记者和外国记者在参加了苏联外交部长葛罗米柯的记者招待会之后，应邀参观了在莫斯科高尔基中央文化休息公园展出的被击落的美国飞机残骸。在参观展览会时，记者们遇到了苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫，当时赫鲁晓夫已经参观过了飞机残骸展览会，同专家们谈了话，准备离开了。记者们围住了赫鲁晓夫，同他谈起话来。
    记者们对他们有机会看到飞机的残骸和这架飞机的装备和专门仪器，表示满意。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我看你们对记者招待会很满意。你们所感兴趣的问题大概都得到了回答。我已经说过，我们打算把美国飞机入侵苏联领空的问题提交安全理事会。看来，美国将会对安理会施加压力，如果安理会因此而不能通过正确的决议的话，那么，我们就要把这个问题提交联合国大会。美国的这种侵略行动是非常危险的现象。
    由于下述情况，危险就更加深了：美国国务卿赫脱在他5月9日的声明中不仅为已经干出的侵略行动辩护，而且还说，美国政府今后仍打算进行这种飞行。这是对和平的直接威胁。我们将击落这样的飞机，将打击那些让侵犯我国的飞机起飞的基地。你们自己知道，如果这种侵略行动仍将继续，那么，这就可能导致战争。
    问：可以向您提出一个问题吗？——一位记者向赫鲁晓夫说。
    赫鲁晓夫：甚至可以提出两个问题。（活跃）
    问：您大概已经看到飞机残骸中间有一张招贴画，上面写着要求给飞行员以援助。您认为这张招贴画的作者想说的是什么呢？
    赫鲁晓夫：当飞行员飞到我们这里的时候，我们给了他帮助，并保证给予了应有的接待。如果还有其他这样的不速之客要来的话，我们也将像这次一样“好客地”接待他们。我们要进行审讯，并且要把他们作为间谍严厉审讯。
    问：这一切将对高级会议产生什么影响？
    赫鲁晓夫：让那些派遣这架侦察飞机的人来考虑这些吧。其实，在这以前他们就应该考虑到后果。要知道，这是对我国进行了侵略。今后我们也将消灭一切动手侵犯我们的人。你们看，我们的火箭手在击中飞机时是多么小心，击中了而没有燃烧起来！飞行员活着，仪器是完整的，总之，物证俱全。这就是我们火箭手的高明之处。为此要特别感谢他们。（活跃、掌声）
    问：艾森豪威尔先生将要来莫斯科，这次飞机事件是否会对苏联社会舆论有所影响？
    赫鲁晓夫：我不愿意处于艾森豪威尔总统所处的那种状况。我不愿意收到当艾森豪威尔到苏联时可能向他提出的那些问题！我可以说的只是苏联人民和我国社会人士是很有礼貌的，因此，不会发生任何过火行为，但是，对总统是要提问题的。（活跃、笑声）
    我可以这样说：在这方面有一个人特别帮了总统的忙，这就是赫脱先生。
    赫脱在他的记者招待会上发表了一项强盗的声明！他不仅不为侵略行动而感到有罪，感到羞愧，而且还为这些行动辩护，说今后仍要这样。只有处于战争状态的国家才会这样做。我们现在同美国并没有处于战争状态。这些侵略行动和赫脱的声明——厚颜无耻，厚颜无耻！
    赫脱的声明使我们对我们过去得出的美国总统不知道这次飞行、美国政府不知道这次飞行这种结论的正确性发生了怀疑。赫脱发表的声明恰恰说明这个侦察计划是得到美国政府批准的。看来，美国人不得不这样声明，因为否则就应该法办艾伦·杜勒斯。而杜勒斯也会揭露政府，他会说，他是在执行政府批准的计划，也就是说，执行政府首脑批准的计划。我是以赫脱发表的声明为根据的。
    往昔，记得还是在我的青年时代，有许多犯罪的、没有护照的和其他各种形迹可疑的人到处逛来逛去。这批人惯用这样的手法：一个好人在小道上走着，走过一座小桥；小桥下坐着一个强盗，和他在一起的是个男孩子。强盗把小孩派到过路人那里去，于是孩子说：先生，请把表给我。这个人说：干什么，这是怎么回事？滚开！孩子回答说：这是怎么回事，叔叔，表不是我的吗？你为什么不把我的表还给我？在争吵声中，武装强盗走过来并对过路人说：你为什么欺侮小孩子，把他的表给他，把大衣也脱下来！（笑声）
    美国希望按照这样的法则生活。但是，我们不是没有自卫能力的过路人。我们的国家是强大的、实力雄厚的国家，能够同它较量较量。如果美国过去在自己领土上没有见过真正的战争，没有见过炸弹，如果他们想挑起战争，那末我们将被迫把火箭送到他们那里去，而且火箭将在最初的几分钟之内就到达侵略者的土地上。（掌声）
    因为读了赫脱的声明我才这样说。他说：我们是被迫飞行的；我们飞行是苏联本身的过错，因为它不允许我们知道它的秘密，而我们一定要知道苏联的秘密。他说，因此我们就飞行；要知道，总统说过，必须开放天空：于是我们飞行并且今后还要飞行——要开放天空。
    一个国家的官方人士怎能对别的国家这样说话！我们不是按照美国的法律生活。我们有自己的法律，因此，我们就要使一切人在我国领土上尊重我们的法律。凡是破坏我们法律的，我们就要给予打击！（掌声）
    我很喜欢英国“工人日报”上的一篇文章，这篇文章的大意是这样的：如果接受美国某些人想给公众灌输的那种哲学，那么，事情大概会是这样的：抓住了一个拧开房间的锁的小偷，但是，原来这不是拧开锁的小偷的过错，而是锁门的主人的过错，因为他逼得小偷不得不设法拧开锁，偷进别人的房子里。
    但是，这是强盗的、土匪的哲学！
    我认为，如果世界公众正确地理解情况的严重性，并负责任地对待表现于美国政策中的这个侵略行为，如果大家都一致地谴责这种行为，而美国今后对其他国家不再采取这类方法，那么，这将是很好的一种清凉剂，可以说是国与国之间关系中的消毒剂。
    这几天，我在读到美国报刊发表的消息时看到，除了那些为这种行为辩解的公开强盗文人外，在美国报纸上发表文章的绝大多数人（其中包括过去因不客观而闻名的人在内）都对这个事实感到愤慨，认为这是对待苏联背信弃义的行为。这是一个很好的征兆。记者们，如果你们正确地向公众报道，那么，这个事件，像任何别的事件一样，最终必将“被消化”掉的。我们毕竟应当和平相处，先生们，不仅是和平相处，而且要友好相处。（掌声）
    问：是否还可以对美国的政策抱乐观态度？
    赫鲁晓夫：我认为我自己是一个无法改变的乐观主义者。美国侦察机在我国上空进行挑衅飞行一事，我认为并不是准备战争，而是进行试探。他们“已经试探”了我们，但是，我们使那些“试探”者碰了一鼻子灰。现在，美国的某些人士正在吵吵嚷嚷。没关系，让他们吵嚷去吧！因为苏联不是危地马拉。不能派军队来打我们，如果他们想利用他们那种卑鄙的伎俩来对待我们的话，我们有药可以使他们好好地镇静镇静。如果他们要那样做，那么他们得到的就是这些镇静剂。
    问：赫鲁晓夫先生，您从美国回来后对艾森豪威尔所作的估价现在有否改变？
    赫鲁晓夫：要知道，美国国务院就侦察飞机一事所发表的声明，当然在改变我以为美国总统与这件事无关的看法。我过去不知道，美国制定了这种侦察计划，其中包括在苏联领土上空进行侦察飞行的计划。从得到总统同意的美国国务院声明中才明白，美国侦察飞机在我国上空飞行——这不是某个不负责任的军官的任性，而是在执行计划，中央情报局，即美国总统管辖下的机关的领导人艾伦·杜勒斯制定的计划。
    赫脱先生也承认，美国总统曾下令用一切可能的手段搜集各种情报。根据这些指示，制定和执行了计划。据赫脱说，这些计划包括利用飞机和通过渗入的办法从空中进行广泛的观测。我请求你们注意这点——通过渗入的办法，这就是在一个与之建立有正常关系的国家的领土上到处进行侦察间谍飞行。而这个计划是总统批准的。真是闻所未闻的事！在这种情况以后，如果我还应当说，你们是多么可亲的人！这样做，就等于不尊重自己。我要说，赫脱先生已经摘下了所有的遮布，擦掉了各种油彩，而这些东西——如果可以这样说的话——本来是给美国帝国主义者的政策伪装、掩饰和涂脂抹粉的。他在自己的讲话中露出了一幅吓人的军国主义的獠牙。这又怎样？现在看来这种獠牙没有什么可怕。美国军国主义者的这种行动并不是出于他们主使者的英勇，而是由于胆怯。危险的并不是能支配着自己神经、依靠自己力量和可能性的人，而是害怕一切的胆小鬼。
    我常常阅读到这样的话：据赫鲁晓夫断言，资本主义必将灭亡。是为这点而对苏联采取侦察飞行吗？但是，要知道这不是我说的，而是马克思早在一百年前就论证过了的。（活跃、掌声）
    问：土耳其、巴基斯坦、挪威当局是否知道美国飞机的挑衅飞行？
    赫鲁晓夫：我很难替这些政府说话，但是我设想它们不知道，美国人是不向它们报告的。想必那些设有美国军事基地的国家的总理甚至不被允许到这些基地去。（活跃）
    像土耳其、巴基斯坦这样一些国家和其他国家的过错在于它们加入了侵略性的集团。这种情况用民间的话来说，人把灵魂出卖给魔鬼；当他还没有把灵魂卖掉时，他能够自己支配自己，而后来他的灵魂就由魔鬼来支配了。现在土耳其、巴基斯坦和挪威的情况也是如此。（活跃）
    警告你们，外国记者先生们，不要把自己的灵魂出卖给魔鬼（发出笑声），要把它保留在自己的身上。最好是把自己的工作献给社会的进步发展。共产主义的思想确定了社会发展中最进步最正确的方向。像“震撼世界的十日”一书的作者约翰·里德这样一些优秀的美国人，是懂得这些思想的伟大意义的。约翰·里德是一个极有才智的人。他不是生下来就是共产党员，而是在十月革命期间接受共产主义的，他死时是一个共产党员。
    你们之中某些人由于缺乏理智和不够了解常常写文章攻击共产主义。让上帝饶恕你们这样做。（场内活跃、掌声）
    我在读到资产阶级记者对苏联的真实情况，对共产主义的诬蔑时，有时感到愤怒，但是过后想一想说，并不是所有的记者都是约翰·里德。要知道这是些普通人，他们被像赫斯特出版社这样一些出版机构所雇用的，这些公司像蜘蛛一样抓住人并用自己的网缠住他。如果这样的记者不写诬蔑共产主义的东西，那么，赫斯特或者其他出版康采恩要他干吗呢。赫斯特一天也不会养活这样的记者的。
    我同赫斯特谈过两次话。第二次谈话时我对他说：您对我讲的是一个样子，而写的是另一个样子，这是怎么回事呢？他回答说：难道我不正确地阐述了谈话的内容吗？应该对他作出应有的评价——他或多或少地正确地阐述了谈话的内容，但是刊登了对谈话的整个思想进行歪曲的评论。我对他谈到了这一点，而他回答说：因为我是资本家呀，我发表自己的评论（场内活跃）。他是资本家，而你们中间的大多数并不是资本家，而且永远也不会成为资本家。那么你们为什么要为资本主义效劳呢？为什么要作资本主义的走狗呢？（掌声）我坚信，条条道路都通向共产主义。其他还有什么地方可通呢？！
    美国帝国主义者正是害怕这一点。因此他们神经过敏，进行卤莽的冒险行动。这说明，他们不相信自己的制度。美国国务院声明说：所有国家都在从事间谍活动。可是，苏联过去和现在从来没有派遣过自己的飞机到美国或者到其他国家进行过侦察。如果说在个别情况下，我们的飞机，偶而侵犯了别国的领空（这是在同土耳其和伊朗的交界处），那么，我们已向这些国家道歉，并且惩办进行这种侵犯的人。
    我们要警告那些今后企图派遣他们的间谍到我国来的人，要好好考虑一下后果。
    问：您现在是否还希望艾森豪威尔总统访问苏联？
    赫鲁晓夫：对此，您将说什么？请设身处地，替我回答一下吧（笑声）。你们自己现在看到发生了怎样的困难。我是坦率地对你们说的。你们知道我对美国总统的态度，我反复地说过这点。但是，我的希望在某种程度上没有实现。我是一个人，我有人的感情，我要对领导苏联政府的工作负责。要明白，我们俄罗斯人、苏联人，心境是坦白的——说散步就散步，说打就打。我现在怎么能要求我国人民出来欢迎呢，怎能告诉他们前来访问的是贵宾呢。人们会说，你发疯了，因为批准派遣间谍飞机的，算什么贵宾呢。美国军国主义者派飞机到我国从事间谍活动，他们使我这个负责筹备美国总统访苏的人处于十分尴尬的境地。坦白地说，我想美国总统自己也了解这点。
    设想一下，如果在我访美以前，我们派这种飞机到美国去，并且飞机在那里被击落，可以想像，美国人会怎样对待我。俗话说，按功绩来迎接。我想，这一点是大家都懂得的。
    但是可以保证，在总统访问时，不会有任何过火的行动。我国人民是有礼貌的，他们只是口头上讲，而让政府去采取行动，不允许有任何侮辱的行为。我想，美国记者和旅行者现在就感觉到了苏联人民的自制力和纪律性。我没有听到过有人说了什么侮辱美国人的话。这是值得赞扬的。这说明我国人民的精神力量。
    问：关于这架飞机飞行的问题是否将成为最高级会议上讨论的对象？
    赫鲁晓夫：它现在已经是全世界讨论的对象了。因此我现在并不认为这个问题必须列入会议日程中去。我们考虑到，代表社会主义国家的只有我一人，而代表西方国家的却有三位代表。但是，我不认为这三位代表中的两位会赞同美国黩武主义者这次危险的侵略行动。
    显然，大家都对我什么时候打算飞往巴黎一事感到兴趣。我打算在5月14日到巴黎去，即在会议开始的前一天，甚至前两天到巴黎，以便稍微习惯一下环境。我喜欢巴黎，它是个美好的城市。（活跃）但是，如果其他人不来的话（我这样说，是因为某些人以会议可能举行不成来进行威胁），那么，大家都会明白，会议举行不成并不是由于我们的过错。这就是为什么我们要到巴黎去！要是会议不举行呢？那有什么呢，我们没有它，还不是活过了这么多年，我们还将活一百年。（笑声、掌声）
    会议不仅对我国有利害关系，对全世界也有利害关系。全世界的人民都期望国际紧张局势得到缓和，希望各国之间的关系正常化。我认为，最高级会议对我们谈判的对方的利害关系不亚于苏联。因此，会议将取决于我们的对方。我们是有准备的。我再重复一遍，我准备在星期六，5月14日乘飞机到巴黎去。
    据说，有些外交家抱怨我，他们说，赫鲁晓夫措辞过于尖锐了。我倒想听一听，如果他们的国家遭到类似的侵略性的侵犯的话，他们会有什么样反应？！难道，我现在应该脱帽欢迎这种侵犯？！不，我们要以应有的方法去对待贼。这是强盗和土匪的袭击。（掌声）
    你们在这里看见了“取空气的仪器”吗？（笑声）在这种说法被揭穿之后，说这种话的人能用什么样的眼睛看呢？是的，我们知道，帝国主义者长的是什么样的眼睛。常言说得好，人家向他们眼睛里吐痰，而他们却说是上帝的甘露。（笑声，掌声）
    现在你们看到，在最高苏维埃会议上，我故意在我的报告中不把所有的东西都说出来，因为，我们知道，我们是在跟谁打交道。起初，我们没说飞行员活着、仪器还完整、飞机没爆炸等。于是他们认为，飞行员自杀了。而现在，当他还活着的时候，美国的报纸由于飞行员违反了指示，没有自杀，而投降了，便对他进行严厉的谴责。
    在美国有些人说，应当审判飞行员，因为他没有完成指示，没有自杀。这是野兽的论调。这就是帝国主义意识形态。你们，美国记者先生们，读过你们的报纸吗？这真是骇人听闻的事。
    问：美国代办有没有向您要求同鲍尔士见面？
    赫鲁晓夫：美国人就这件事发来了照会，要求我们允许同他见面。但是，他们自己也明白，这是太过份了。飞行员正在受侦查之中，要知道，他是间谍。现在怎么能同他见面呢？他应该受到我们苏联法庭的审判。
    问：这是否意味着，无论是大使还是临时代办都不能被允许同鲍尔士见面？
    赫鲁晓夫：我没有这样说。我们自己将作出决定。也许他们可以见面，也许不能见面。我现在还不能回答这个问题，因为正在进行侦查。
    问：您是否将认为，在同东德缔结和约以后，西方国家的飞机飞往柏林就是侵略行动？
    赫鲁晓夫：我们已经就这个问题发表了声明。我再重复一遍，在同德意志民主共和国缔结和约以后，由于军事投降而对这块领土规定的条款所确定的状况就发生变化了。从那时起，对西柏林的占领状态就将结束，根据德国投降所取得的进入柏林的一切通道从这时起都将停止开放。那时，德意志民主共和国将完全控制自己的领土，以及进入位于它的领土内的西柏林的通道。如果德意志民主共和国同有关国家达成协议，允许它们利用空间、水路、铁路和公路，那么，这已经不是我们的事情了，而是德意志民主共和国的事情了。这是它的主权。
    有些人说，西方国家将用武力冲入西柏林。我想明确地说：如果谁敢用武力来冲，那么，驻扎在德意志民主共和国维护和平的我们的部队，也将用武力来对付和平破坏者，让西方爱动脑筋的人们考虑考虑，由此对他们将会产生什么结果。
    问：鉴于这个飞机事件和您对艾森豪威尔总统的态度，您是否宁愿艾森豪威尔的访问延期？
    赫鲁晓夫：关于这个问题，当我们在巴黎会晤时，将同总统交换意见。我们像过去一样希望找到同美国改善关系的途径，我们希望同美国有正常的关系。我们相信，苏美关系将来会发展成为两国人民之间的友好关系。这将是正常的，而所有正常的人现在和将来都希望如此。
    还有问题吗？
    有人喊：没有了。谢谢。（一致鼓掌）
    赫鲁晓夫：最后我想说如下的话。我们要严厉地对付那些侵犯我国边界的人，侵犯我们主权的人。但是，我们希望同各国人民一起生活在和平与友谊之中。先生们，当我们愤怒地谴责这种侵略活动时，请你们理解我们的处境。但是，我们清醒地看待事态，并且清楚地懂得，一切争论，即使是最尖锐的争论，也比战争要好。因此，我们将尽一切努力使目前的尖锐形势“消化掉”，尽一切努力使国际局势进入正常轨道、恢复同美国的良好关系，当然，如果美国也将同样促进这点的话。
    因此我要求你们考虑到这一点，而且不要写出会使局势变得更尖锐、更紧张的任何东西。你们为什么要这样做呢？要知道，如果发生战争，对你们也不是好事。（掌声）战争不会给任何人带来幸福。
    最近几天，我读了很多美国议员、实业界人士的讲话，他们之中很多人都谴责政府的这种行为，我认为这是良好的征兆。我认为一个好的预兆，是人们没有丧失理智，并不是所有的人都像赫脱那样来解释这件事。
    问：由于您将访问巴黎，您对法国人民有什么祝愿呢？
    赫鲁晓夫：我不想把一国人民同另一国人民对立起来，法国人民接待我同美国人民一样，是好客的。但是，我到法国去的比较晚，因此印象比较新。我不仅非常满意法国人民对我的接待，而且非常满意我同法国总统戴高乐的交谈。关于人民没有什么可说的。所有的人民都希望和平。战争是由政府发动的，而人民不得不流血。因此，他们所有人都希望和平。
    法国人民也希望和平。我们曾同法国一起对军国主义的德国作过战。如果爆发了战争——它可能由西德发动——，那么法国人知道，他们过去曾有一个好盟国——苏联。这个盟国会再次对他们有好处。但是最好是我们共同来防止战争，并成为争取和平的盟国。
    我想，这次意想不到的记者招待会可以结束了。谨向你们表示感谢，亲爱的同志们和先生们，并祝你们成功。你们要坚持真理，维护崇高的和平事业，那么你们将得到本国人民的尊敬。（一致鼓掌。有人喊：“谢谢！”）
