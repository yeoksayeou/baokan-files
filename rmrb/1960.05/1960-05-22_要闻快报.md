			Shaanxi Takes Early Action to Prevent and Control Cotton Pests
			After the basic completion of cotton sowing, people's communes in the cotton-producing areas of Shaanxi Province immediately launched a mass movement to prevent and control cotton pests, resolutely eliminating pests such as cotton aphids and cutworms before the cotton seedlings emerge.
			According to surveys in various places, the spring drought and high temperatures this year are conducive to the development of pests. Therefore, the number of overwintering cotton pests is greater than in previous years. For example, the number of cotton aphid eggs is twice that of previous years, and the incubation period is about 10 days earlier. The Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Shaanxi Provincial People's Committee recently issued instructions to eliminate cotton pests early. Relevant provincial departments have sent technical personnel to each city and county in the main cotton-producing areas for specific guidance. The five joint prevention zones for crop diseases and insect pests in the Guanzhong area held a joint prevention meeting to make unified arrangements for the early elimination of cotton pests. At present, all cotton-producing areas have begun to take action to eliminate cotton pests early.

          陕西提早防治棉花害虫
    陕西省产棉区各人民公社在棉花播种基本结束后，立即展开防治棉花害虫的群众运动，坚决把棉蚜、地老虎等害虫消灭在棉苗出土以前。
    根据各地调查，今春天旱、气温高，有利于害虫的发展，因而各种棉花害虫都比往年越冬存活的数量多。如棉蚜卵比往年多二倍，孵化期提早十天左右。中共陕西省委和陕西省人民委员会最近发出提前消灭棉花害虫的指示，省级有关部门给主要产棉区的每个市县，都派了技术人员进行具体指导。关中地区的五个农作物病虫害联防区召开了联防会议，对提前消灭棉花害虫的工作，作了统一的部署。目前，各棉产区已纷纷动手，提前消灭棉花害虫。
