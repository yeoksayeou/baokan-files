Learning from the Advanced, Catching Up with Famous Brands

    Each Finds a Rival, Vigorously Catches Up with Shanghai
    Light industry workers in Shenyang are actively learning from the advanced levels nationwide. Some factories in the textile, paper making, silicate, and food industries have already taken Shanghai Tianchu MSG Factory, Yimin Food Factory, Guofeng Paper Mill, Plastics Products Factory No. 2, and Aotu Color Printing Factory as their learning targets.
    In order to improve the quality of shirts, workers at the Shenyang Shirt Factory disassembled "Xin Guang" and "Luye" brand shirts produced in Shanghai piece by piece, compared them with their own factory's products to study the characteristics of each process, and repeatedly conducted production experiments. Now, the "Shanhe Brand" men's shirts they produce have achieved flat collars, even stitches, neat visible stitching, and beautiful styles. The quality of the factory's men's and women's shirts has basically reached the level of "Xin Guang" and "Luye" brand shirts. The biscuits produced by the Shenyang Biscuit Factory have greatly improved in terms of crispness, taste, and layers, and the appearance has also changed from the past shortcomings of irregular specifications, incorrect edges, and unclear patterns.

    各找对手　猛赶上海
    沈阳市轻工业职工积极向全国先进水平看齐。纺织、造纸、硅酸盐、食品四个行业的一些工厂，已经把上海天厨味精厂、益民食品厂、国丰造纸厂、塑料制品二厂、凹凸彩印厂等作为学习的对象。
    沈阳市衬衣厂工人为了提高衬衣质量，把上海出产的“新光”、“绿叶”牌衬衣逐片拆下，对照本厂的产品研究各道工序制作的特点，反复对照进行制作试验。现在他们生产的“山河牌”男衬衣做到了领子平正，针码均匀、明线整齐、样式美观。这个厂的男女衬衣质量基本达到“新光”、“绿叶”牌衬衣的水平。沈阳市饼干厂，生产的饼干，在酥松程度、口味、层次等方面，都比过去大为提高，外观也一改过去规格不整齐，棱角不正，花纹不清晰等缺点。
