    Guangzhou Central District Finance and Trade and Other Departments Adopt Centralized Training, On-Site Guidance and Other Methods to Help Urban Communes Train Accountants and Cooks

    (Reported by our newspaper) To meet the needs of urban people's communes in establishing a large number of street public canteens, the finance and trade departments and the catering industry in the Central District of Guangzhou City have actively adopted various forms to help canteens train a large number of financial accountants and cooks, and have achieved remarkable results. According to statistics as of early May, in the past few months, they have helped train more than 80 financial accountants and more than 1,000 cooks, which has played a significant role in improving the work of street canteens.

    When helping street canteens train financial accountants and cooks, the finance and trade departments in the Central District of Guangzhou City adopted different training methods based on the requirements of urgent tasks, short time, and quick results, as well as the different characteristics of the two types of work. In terms of training financial accountants, considering that the cultural level of the employees is generally not high, but they have more time for concentrated study, they selected two section chiefs from the Finance Bureau and the People's Bank, as well as a group of excellent tax collectors, accountants, and cashiers, to serve as teachers. They also compiled easy-to-understand textbooks such as the "Simplified Accounting System" as teaching materials and held short-term accounting business training courses. The training courses adopted methods such as regular classes, group discussions, phased tests, and experience exchange performances. In addition, the personnel sent by these two units to various canteens to help clear old accounts and establish new accounts also took time to provide on-site guidance to the students, so that what the students learned in the classroom could be better combined with practice to achieve the purpose of applying what they have learned. Since March of this year, more than 80 students have been trained, and they can basically master basic accounting knowledge and generally be able to do accounts independently. Among them, 29 people, due to their excellent academic performance, also formed seven accounting teams, which are responsible for the accounting work of 161 larger canteens in the entire district, so that the financial accounting system of each canteen is gradually on a sound track. For example, before the accountant of the Baohua Street Canteen in this district was trained, because he could not do the accounts, he could only put cash in his left pocket and food stamps in his right pocket, so the accounts were unclear, and it was impossible to settle the canteen's profits and losses. After participating in the financial accounting training class, he mastered the basic accounting knowledge. In addition to establishing the necessary financial registration system for income, expenditure, and inventory, he also implemented the method of "two verifications and one clearance" (that is, verifying the amount of grain used and the number of meal tickets collected, and clearing the accounts on the same day), so that the canteen's accounts were clear and could be announced to the public every month within two days. Now, the canteens in this district have basically achieved "meal-by-meal accounting, daily reporting, clear accounts, and open finances."

    In terms of helping canteens train cooks, the catering industry in the Central District of Guangzhou City adopted three methods: first, sending chefs to canteens for on-site guidance, implementing learning while teaching, and learning while doing; second, absorbing canteen cooks to practice in the kitchens of restaurants on the spot, following the shifts for labor, with chefs from restaurants providing specific guidance, guaranteeing teaching and learning; third, compiling simple cooking technology textbooks, organizing canteen cooks to conduct short-term training in concentration during their spare time, and conducting regular tests and appraisals. According to statistics, the catering industry in this district has successively sent 213 chefs to 161 canteens with more than 100 people eating in the entire district for guidance, and has absorbed 219 cooks from various canteens to practice in restaurant kitchens. In addition, dozens of small short-term training courses have been held. Now they have trained more than 1,000 cooks for the canteens, accounting for 96.8% of the cooks who should be trained in the entire district. After training, the cooking skills of these cooks have generally improved, and 151 of them have reached the level equivalent to third- or fourth-grade chefs. The variety and quality of the canteen's dishes have also been significantly increased and improved. In the past, most canteens only provided three or several kinds of dishes every day, but now they have generally increased to about ten kinds, and some have even reached more than ten kinds, which are warmly welcomed by the masses, and the number of people eating in the canteens is also increasing.

    广州中区财贸等部门采取集中训练、现场辅导等办法 
    帮助城市公社培训会计和炊事员
    本报讯　适应城市人民公社大量举办街道公共食堂的需要，广州市中区财贸部门和饮食行业，积极采取多种形式，帮助食堂大量培训财务会计人员和炊事人员，已取得显著成效。到5月上旬的统计，几个月来他们已帮助培训财务会计人员八十多名，炊事人员一千多名，在健全街道食堂的工作上发挥了显著的作用。
    广州市中区财贸等部门在帮助街道食堂培训财务会计和炊事人员时，根据任务急、时间短、收效要快这几个要求和两个工种不同的特点，采取了不同的培训办法。在财务会计人员的培训方面，根据职工的文化水平一般不高，但时间较多便于集中学习的情况，便从财政局和人民银行选派两位业务科长和一批优秀的稽征干部、会计员、出纳员当教师，并编写了“简易会计制度”等通俗课本作教材，举办短期会计业务训练班。训练班采用定期上课、分组讨论、分阶段进行测验和举行经验交流会演等方式进行培训。此外，这两个单位派往各食堂帮助清理旧账和建立新账的人员，还抽出时间，对学员进行现场辅导，使学员在课堂上学到的东西能够和实践更好地结合起来，达到学以致用的目的。今年3月以来培训的八十多个学员，基本上都能掌握会计基本知识，一般能够独立做账。其中有二十九人由于学习成绩优异，还组成七个会计小组，分别负担起全区一百六十一个较大食堂的会计工作，使各食堂财务会计制度逐步走上健全轨道。如这个区宝华街食堂的会计员在受训前，由于不会做账，只能左边的口袋放现金，右边的口袋放粮票饭票，因此帐目不清，更无法结算食堂盈亏损益。参加财务会计训练班学习后，便掌握了基本的会计知识，除建立了必要的财务进、支、存登记制度外，并实行“两核一清”（即核算用粮数和回收饭票数以及即日清账）的办法，使饭堂账目一清二楚，并能按月在两天内把每月收支情况向群众公布。现在，这个区的食堂基本上都已做到“餐餐核算，日日报账，账目清楚，财务公开。”
    在帮助食堂培训炊事员方面，广州市中区饮食行业采取了三种办法进行：一是派出厨师到食堂进行现场辅导，实行边教边学，边学边做；二是吸收食堂的炊事员到饮食店厨房就地实习，跟班劳动，由饮食店厨师具体指导，包教保学；三是编写简易的烹调技术教材，组织食堂炊事员利用业余时间集中进行短期训练；并定期进行测验鉴定。据统计，这个区的饮食行业已先后派出厨师二百一十三人，分赴全区一百六十一个有一百人以上吃饭的食堂进行辅导，并从各食堂吸收了二百一十九名炊事员，分别到饮食店厨房实习。另外还举办了几十期的小型短期训练班。现在他们已为食堂培训了炊事员一千多人，占全区应受训的炊事员96.8％。经过培训，这些炊事员的烹调技术普遍提高，其中有一百五十一人还达到相当于三级或四级厨师的水平。食堂饭菜的花色品种和质量，也有了显著的增加和提高。过去，各食堂每天供应的菜大多只有三几种，现在已普遍增到十种左右，有的还达到十种以上，受到群众热烈欢迎，到食堂吃饭的人数也越来越多。
