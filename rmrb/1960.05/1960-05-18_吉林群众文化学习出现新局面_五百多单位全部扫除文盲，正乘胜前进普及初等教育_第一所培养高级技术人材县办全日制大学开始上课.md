    Jilin Province has recently witnessed the emergence of a number of illiteracy-free communes, illiteracy-free streets, and illiteracy-free factories and mines. A new situation has emerged in the province's literacy campaign and after-school education.

    Currently, sixteen people's communes, including Liangjia in Da'an County, Dehui Town in Dehui County, Yanhe in Yushu County, Liangshui in Hunchun County, Dongsheng in Yanji County, and two hundred and forty-five management areas, such as Nanwaizi Management Area of Chalucha People's Commune in Yongji County, and eighteen urban streets have become illiteracy-free communes, illiteracy-free management areas, and illiteracy-free streets. Before May Day, another two hundred and eighty-four factories and mines in the province had completely eliminated illiteracy, becoming illiteracy-free factories and mines.

    After eliminating illiteracy, these illiteracy-free units closely integrated with production and central tasks, popularized after-school elementary education, and developed after-school secondary education. Liangjia People's Commune in Da'an County has established one hundred and four after-school senior primary classes, twelve junior middle school classes, and one technical class, with more than four thousand two hundred people participating in studies at various levels. Changchun Thermal Insulation Materials Factory, Wangqing Forestry Bureau, and other units have adopted the method of "original soldiers, original generals, original battlefield" to popularize after-school elementary education after eliminating illiteracy in their respective units.

    After becoming literate, the broad masses of workers and peasants actively studied Chairman Mao's works and delved into scientific and technological knowledge. In Liangshui People's Commune, Hunchun County, the number of people who persisted in studying Chairman Mao's works increased from seventy-eight in 1958 to more than three thousand one hundred now. By studying Chairman Mao's works, the broad masses of cadres and commune members raised their awareness, emancipated their minds, dared to think and act, and actively delved into scientific and technological knowledge. On the basis of eliminating illiteracy, Chaoyang People's Commune in Yanji County has cultivated fifty tractor drivers and more than six hundred various technical personnel through after-school technical learning.

    Now, through summaries and examinations, various localities have further stimulated the enthusiasm of students for learning and have set off a learning upsurge to learn from and catch up with the advanced, laying a good foundation for continuing to popularize after-school secondary and higher education.

    Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 17th -- The first county-run full-time university in Jilin Province to train senior agricultural scientific and technical personnel – the Nong'an County Agricultural Accelerated Higher Vocational School – recently began classes.

    This university recruits students with a junior middle school education level. The duration of study is five years, including two years of preparatory courses, mainly studying basic courses, and three years of vocational courses, focusing on professional courses. After graduation, they will reach the level of graduates from national full-time institutions of higher learning. Currently, the school has two majors, agronomy and agricultural machinery, with one hundred and one students. As most of the students this semester were transferred from the county agricultural school run by the state, they already have a year and a half of high school education, so the study period for students this semester has been shortened to three and a half years.

    In order to implement the Party's policy of "education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor," the school has established a production labor base including a farm and an agricultural machinery factory for teachers and students to engage in productive labor.

    The Nong'an County Party Committee, in order to realize the National Agricultural Development Program targets ahead of schedule, has formulated a leap forward plan for agricultural technology transformation in the county. According to the plan, from now to 1962, the county will need more than 20,000 various technical cadres in agricultural machinery, crop cultivation, horticulture and fruit trees, and water conservancy. To this end, the Nong'an County Party Committee decided to accelerate the training of agricultural scientific and technical personnel self-reliantly and established this new type of agricultural accelerated higher vocational school.

    吉林群众文化学习出现新局面
    五百多单位全部扫除文盲，正乘胜前进普及初等教育
    第一所培养高级技术人材县办全日制大学开始上课
    本报讯　吉林省最近出现了一批无盲公社、无盲街道、无盲厂矿。全省扫盲运动业余教育出现了新的局面。
    目前，全省已有大安县两家、德惠县德惠镇、榆树县沿河、珲春县凉水、延吉县东盛等十六个人民公社，和永吉县岔路河人民公社南崴子管理区等二百四十五个管理区、十八个城市街道成为无盲公社、无盲管理区、无盲街道。在“五一”前，省内又有二百八十四个厂矿全部扫除了文盲，成为无盲厂矿。
    这些无盲单位在扫除文盲后，又紧密结合生产和中心工作，普及了业余初等教育，并发展了业余中等教育。大安县两家人民公社已经办起一百零四个业余高小班、十二个初中班和一个技术班，有四千二百多人分别参加各级学校学习。长春市保温材料厂、汪清森工局等单位，在本单位消灭文盲之后，都采取“原兵，原将，原战场”的办法，普及了业余初等教育。
    广大工农群众脱盲之后，积极攻读毛主席著作，钻研科学技术知识。珲春县凉水人民公社坚持学习毛主席著作的人数，由1958年的七十八人增加到现在的三千一百多人。广大干部和社员学习了毛主席的著作，提高了觉悟，解放了思想，敢想敢干，积极钻研科学技术知识。延吉县朝阳人民公社，在扫除文盲的基础上，通过业余技术学习，已经培养出五十名拖拉机手和六百多名各种技术人材。
    现在，各地通过总结、考试，进一步激发了学员们的学习积极性，掀起了学先进、赶先进的学习热潮，为继续普及业余中等教育和高等教育打下了良好的基础。
    据新华社长春17日电　吉林省第一所培养高级农业科学技术人材的县办全日制大学——农安县农业速成高等专科学校，在最近开学上课。
    这所大学招收具有初中毕业文化水平的学生。学习期限为五年，其中预科两年，主要学习基础课，专科三年，集中学习专业课，毕业后达到国家全日制高等院校毕业生水平。目前，全校设有农学和农业机械两个专业，有学生一百零一名。由于这学期学生大多是从国家办的县农业学校抽调的，他们已经具有高中一年半的文化水平，所以这学期学生的学习年限缩短为三年半。
    为了贯彻党的“教育为无产阶级的政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合”的方针，学校建立了包括有农场和农业机械厂的生产劳动基地，供学校师生生产劳动。
    中共农安县委为了提前实现全国农业发展纲要指标，制定了全县农业技术改造的跃进规划。按照规划要求，从现在到1962年，全县需要农业机械、作物栽培、园艺果树、水利等各种技术干部两万多名。为此，中共农安县委决定自力更生地加快培养农业科学技术人材，创办了这所新型的农业速成高等专科学校。
