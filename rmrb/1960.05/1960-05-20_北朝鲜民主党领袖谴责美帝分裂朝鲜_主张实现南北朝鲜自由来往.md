Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 18th: Kang Ryang-uk, Chairman of the Central Committee of the North Korean Democratic Party, published an article in "Democratic Korea" today, advocating the immediate realization of free movement between North and South Korea.

The article emphasized that the Korean people can no longer tolerate the Americans from across the ocean planting boundary markers on the land of the Korean people's motherland and standing there with guns, cutting off the Korean people's mutual exchanges. This abnormal situation must not continue.

The article stated that realizing free movement between North and South Korea is a very urgent matter for the Korean people. Since ancient times, the Korean people have lived together, regardless of the east, west, north, or south of their motherland. However, due to the U.S. imperialists' policy of dividing Korea, an artificial wall has been created between North and South Korea, causing the people of North and South Korea to be separated for fifteen years, unable to meet or even communicate. Especially during the Korean War, the U.S. imperialists used guns and knives to abduct a large number of peaceful residents from North Korea to South Korea, causing them to be separated from their parents, wives, relatives, and friends for ten years, suffering torment in South Korea.

The article said that leaders of political parties, social organizations, and patriotic people in South Korea should not stand idly by regarding this urgent issue that the people demand to be resolved. The article said that realizing free movement between North and South Korea will not only reunite many families but will also become a driving force for promoting the peaceful reunification of Korea. The entire Korean people, seeing the completely different scenes in North and South Korea, will clearly recognize which path leads to the prosperity of the motherland and the happiness of the people.

    北朝鲜民主党领袖谴责美帝分裂朝鲜
    主张实现南北朝鲜自由来往
    据新华社平壤18日电  北朝鲜民主党中央委员会委员长康良煜今天在“民主朝鲜报”上发表文章，主张立即实现南北朝鲜之间的自由来往。
    文章强调说，朝鲜人民再也不能容忍大洋彼岸的美国佬在朝鲜人民祖国的土地上插上界标，背着枪站在那里断绝朝鲜人民的互相来往的这种不正常的状况继续下去了。
    文章说，实现南北朝鲜的自由来往，对朝鲜人民来说是十分迫切的事情。朝鲜人民自古以来不分祖国的东西南北生活在一起。但是由于美帝国主义分裂朝鲜的政策在南北朝鲜之间制造了一条人为的墙壁，使南北朝鲜人民十五年来分处南北，不仅不能见面，而且连音信也不通。特别是在朝鲜战争时期，美帝国主义用枪刀把大量的和平居民从朝鲜北部劫往南朝鲜，使他们十年来离开自己的父母妻子、亲戚朋友，在南朝鲜受着折磨。
    文章说，南朝鲜各政党、社会团体的领导人和爱国志士对人民要求解决的这一迫切的问题不应袖手旁观。文章说，实现南北朝鲜的自由来往，不仅会使许多家庭团聚，而且将成为促进朝鲜和平统一的推动力量。全体朝鲜人民看到南北朝鲜的完全不同的景象，就会清楚地认识到那一条道路是使祖国繁荣、人民幸福的道路。
