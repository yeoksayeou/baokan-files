Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing. People's communes in Jiangsu are breaking with the old habit of "nurturing seedlings after wheat harvesting" for cotton interplanted in wheat fields. They are actively strengthening seedling management, striving to make the unit area yield of wheat interplanted cotton exceed that of single-crop cotton this year.

Wheat interplanted cotton accounts for a large proportion of the total cotton planting area in Jiangsu Province. By the end of April, the province had planted 4.8 million mu of wheat interplanted cotton. A large number of cotton seedlings were also cultivated in nutrient pots, ready to transplant 500,000 mu of wheat stubble cotton after the wheat harvest. To ensure a bumper harvest of wheat interplanted cotton, various localities have broken with conventions and started seedling management after the cotton seedlings emerged. In Nantong Prefecture, which has the most wheat interplanted cotton, counties and communes have universally mobilized cadres and commune members to formulate a complete set of seedling management methods tailored to the characteristics of wheat interplanted cotton. The Chuan’gang Commune in Nantong County gently clamped the wheat with reeds and hemp stalks to ensure ventilation and light for the cotton seedlings in the wheat rows. The communes in Dongtai County changed the past practice of treating cotton diseases and pests after the wheat harvest. This year, they combined the prevention and control of late-stage wheat diseases and pests with the early prevention and control of cotton seedlings in the wheat rows. At present, the county has treated more than 170,000 mu of cotton fields for pests.

While carrying out early-stage seedling management of wheat interplanted cotton, various localities also carried out seedling inspection and replanting. Wuyou Commune in Yancheng County promptly replanted seedlings in 5,000 mu of fields with missing seedlings.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou. Zhejiang Province, based on the characteristics of the two-crop system of cotton and spring crops (the previous crops of cotton fields in Zhejiang are wheat, broad beans, rapeseed, etc.), is comprehensively promoting seedling transplanting this year. As of April 26, the province had sown 1.4 million mu of cotton, of which about 1 million mu was transplanted from seedlings.

To ensure one sowing and full seedlings, various localities are focusing on sowing and seedling management, universally assigning special management personnel for seedling beds and establishing a responsibility system. After Cixi County determined the special management personnel responsibility system, all seedling beds have been drained and treated for pests, and 96% of the seedling beds have been disease-prevented. Changhe Commune in Xiaoshan County has prevented diseases three times in 60% of the seedling beds.

At present, the broad masses and cadres in cotton-growing areas are carrying out a movement to exceed contracted production and planning goals for cotton, determined to strive for a greater cotton harvest this year.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei. Anhui is now universally promoting the methods of cotton nutrient pots, square-block seedling cultivation, and interplanting in wheat fields to sow wheat stubble cotton early, ensuring the planting area and quality of wheat stubble cotton.

In the past, summer-sown cotton in Anhui Province had to wait until the wheat was harvested before planting. This year, in order to increase production through early sowing, various localities have universally promoted the methods of nutrient pots and square-block seedling cultivation, preparing strong seedlings for wheat stubble cotton in advance. The province has made more than 900 million nutrient pots and 14,000 mu of square-block seedlings, which can transplant more than 400,000 mu. At the same time, interplanting cotton in wheat fields is also universally implemented. As early as the autumn wheat planting, various localities arranged for wheat stubble cotton fields. Anqing Prefecture universally adopted methods such as horizontal strip planting and planting on two ridges close together, leaving room for interplanting cotton. Now, more than 290,000 mu have been interplanted. Since mid-April, Wuhu Prefecture has been vigorously cultivating cotton seedlings with nutrient pots and square-block seedlings, while interplanting in wheat fields. Now, 270,000 mu of cotton have been interplanted. Counties in Bengbu Prefecture also used the field edges, borders, and wide rows of spring cotton to cultivate cotton seedlings for transplanting wheat stubble cotton. By adopting these methods, more than half of the wheat stubble cotton in the province has been nurtured and sown before the wheat has been harvested.

This newspaper reports that the cotton-producing area of Guanzhong in Shaanxi is focusing on the preparation of seedling cultivation and other preparations for replanted cotton. In order to compensate for the reduced cotton field area due to water conservancy projects, the Guanzhong area has decided to sow a large amount of replanted cotton this year. Now, various localities have simultaneously assigned the pre-reserved cotton fields and replanted cotton field areas to production teams. Since the Guanzhong area has not had the habit of sowing replanted cotton fields in the past and lacks experience, and at the same time, replanted cotton has to be sown after the summer harvest, labor is very tight. At present, the Guanzhong area is organizing experienced farmers to go to places where replanted cotton has not been planted to impart experience, and is holding on-site seedling cultivation meetings in areas with experience in planting replanted cotton. Various localities have cultivated more than 21,000 mu of seedlings, which can be transplanted to nearly 200,000 mu of wheat stubble fields.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou. As of the 5th, Gansu Province had planted 687,000 mu of cotton, resisting drought, an increase of 18% over last year's actual harvest area. At present, the sowing work in the province is still in progress, with 30,000 mu being sown every day.

Gansu Province is a new cotton planting area in China. Before 1952, the province had only a few scattered cotton fields, with an annual output of only 20,000 to 30,000 dan of cotton. After several years of development, the cotton field has been greatly expanded. The Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held a cotton work conference at the end of last year, deciding to carry out a mass movement for large-scale cotton production. After the meeting, various localities stepped up drought resistance and land preparation. Various counties in Zhangye Prefecture vigorously promoted the experience of planting cotton on winter water fields. Planting cotton on winter water fields can resist drought, sow early, mature early, have more flowers before frost, and have high yield and good quality. Jingyuan County, in the central arid area, originally planned to plant 80,000 mu of cotton. After mass discussions on the economic and political significance of planting cotton, they opened up wasteland and built water conservancy projects, increasing new grain fields and freeing up good water and sandy land to expand cotton planting to 100,000 mu. Anxi County's Wu'ai Commune implemented the method of changing people and livestock without stopping the machine, seizing the moisture to quickly plant cotton, accelerating the sowing speed.

Due to solid organizational work and sufficient preparation, the province's cotton sowing progress this year has been greatly accelerated. Anxi, Jiuquan, Gaotai, Jingyuan, Huicheng, and other key cotton planting counties (cities) have all exceeded their sowing plans.

The area of cotton high-yielding fields cultivated in the province has reached more than 190,000 mu.

    千方百计提高麦茬棉花的产量
    江苏浙江安徽陕西培育壮苗提早移栽多种种好麦茬棉
    甘肃继续抗旱种棉，实播面积已比去年扩大18％
    新华社南京电　江苏各地人民公社对在麦田里套种的棉花，打破了历年来“割麦以后再培苗”的老习惯，积极加强苗期管理，力争今年麦套棉单位面积产量超过一熟棉。
    江苏省麦套棉占全部棉花播种面积比重很大。到4月底止，全省已种麦套棉四百八十万亩，还用营养钵培育了大量棉苗，准备麦收后再移栽麦茬棉五十万亩。为了保证麦套棉丰收，各地都打破常规，棉花见苗后，就展开了苗期管理。麦套棉最多的南通专区，各县、社普遍发动干部、社员针对麦套棉的特点，制定了一整套苗期管理办法。南通县川港公社用芦苇和麻秆轻轻夹住麦子，保证麦行里的棉苗通风透光。东台县各公社改变了过去麦收后再治棉花病虫的习惯，今年结合防治麦子后期病虫害，对麦行里的棉苗及早进行了防病除虫工作。目前全县已防治棉田虫害达十七万多亩。
    各地对麦套棉及早进行苗期管理的同时，还开展了查苗补苗工作。盐城县伍佑公社对五千亩缺苗田，都及时地补了苗。
    据新华社杭州电　浙江省根据棉花和小春作物二熟制（浙江棉田的前茬作物是大小麦、蚕豆、油菜等）的特点，今年全面推广育苗移植。到4月26日止，全省已播种棉花一百四十万亩，其中育苗移植的已达一百万亩左右。
    为保证一次播种一次全苗，各地在抓播种的同时，大抓育苗管理，普遍确定苗床专管人员，建立责任制。慈溪县确定专管员责任制后，全部苗床都已排水、治虫，96％的苗床已经防病。萧山县长河公社有60％的苗床已防病三次。
    目前，棉区广大群众和干部正在开展棉花超包产、超规划运动，决心争取今年棉花更大丰收。
    据新华社合肥电　安徽各地正普遍推行棉花营养钵、方块育苗和麦地套种的办法，提早播种麦茬棉，保证麦茬棉播种面积和质量。
    安徽省的夏播棉花，过去都要等收了麦子才种。今年为了早播增产，各地普遍推行了营养钵和方块育苗的办法，提早为麦茬棉培育了壮苗，全省已制营养钵九亿多个、方块育苗一万四千亩，共可移栽四十多万亩。同时还普遍实行麦田套种棉花。早在去秋种麦时，各地就对麦茬棉田作了安排。安庆专区普遍采取横行条播、二垅靠等办法，为套种棉花留下了余地，现已套种二十九万多亩。芜湖专区从4月中旬起，一边大搞营养钵、方块育苗培育棉苗，一边在麦田里套种，现已套种了棉花二十七万多亩。蚌埠专区各县还利用春棉的田头、畦边和宽行中间培育棉苗，作为移栽麦茬棉的用苗。各地采用这些办法，已使全省一半以上的麦茬棉在麦子没有收割以前，就提前进行了育苗和播种。
    本报讯　陕西关中产棉区大抓回茬棉花的育苗等准备工作。关中地区为弥补因兴修水利工程占地而减少的棉田面积，决定今年大量播种回茬棉花。现在，各地都把预留棉田和回茬棉田面积同时落实到生产队。由于关中地区以往没有播种回茬棉田的习惯，缺乏经验，同时回茬棉花又要在夏收后进行播种，劳力十分紧张。目前关中地区正组织有经验的农民到没有种过回茬棉花的地方去传授经验，并在种回茬棉有经验的地区召开育苗现场会议。各地已育苗二万一千多亩，可移栽近二十万亩麦茬田。
    据新华社兰州电　甘肃省到5日止已抗旱播种棉花六十八万七千多亩，播种面积比去年实收面积扩大了18％。现在，全省播种工作还在继续进行中，每天播种三万亩。
    甘肃省是我国新植棉区。1952年以前全省只有少数零星棉田，年产棉花不过两三万担。经过几年的发展，现在棉田已扩大很多。中共甘肃省委早在去年底就召开了棉花工作会议，决定开展群众性的棉花大面积丰产运动。会后，各地抓紧了抗旱备耕工作。张掖专区各县大力推广了冬水地植棉经验。冬水地种棉花，可以抗旱早种、早熟，霜前花多，产量高，质量好。中部干旱区的靖远县原计划植棉八万亩，经过群众讨论植棉的经济意义和政治意义后，纷纷开荒和兴修水利，增加新的粮田，腾出好水砂地扩种棉花十万亩。安西县五爱公社实行换人换畜不停机，昼夜抢墒快种棉的办法，加快播种速度。
    由于组织工作扎实，准备工作充分，全省今年的棉花播种进度大大加快。植棉重点县（市）的安西、酒泉、高台、靖远、徽成等都已超额完成了播种计划。
    全省培育的棉花丰产方面积达十九万多亩。
