Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 23rd: Six hundred thousand people from all ethnic groups and sectors in Lanzhou held an unprecedented demonstration and rally on the 22nd, supporting the Soviet Union's just position and angrily condemning American imperialism for sabotaging the Four-Power Summit.

From early morning, enraged workers, peasants, cadres, students, citizens, militiamen, and People's Liberation Army soldiers, carrying signs, cartoon boards, and various flags, poured into the various venues in a mighty stream. The streets and alleys were flooded with people, flags formed a forest, and slogans supporting the Soviet government's solemn position and opposing American imperialism's sabotage of the Four-Power Summit reverberated throughout the city.

Ten thousand people participated in the mass rally held in the central venue.

Party and government leaders of Gansu Province and Lanzhou City, leaders of the garrison, responsible persons of local organizations of various democratic parties and people's organizations, participated in the meeting. Soviet experts and Hungarian experts in Lanzhou also participated in the meeting.

Zhang Zhongliang, First Secretary of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, began his speech amidst the enthusiastic slogans of the audience. He said: The 14 million people of Gansu Province, together with the people of the whole country, resolutely support the solemn position taken by the Soviet Union on the Four-Power Summit. Zhang Zhongliang said: A jackal is always a jackal. American imperialism's aggression against the Soviet Union, its sabotage of the Four-Power Summit, and its intensification of international tension are the inevitable manifestations of the imperialist nature, and are not difficult to see at a glance. And American imperialism and its accomplices—modern revisionists—have even reversed black and white, confused right and wrong, and attempted to shirk the responsibility for American imperialism's sabotage of the Four-Power Summit onto the Soviet Union. This is completely a rogue tactic and cannot deceive the people of all countries who are becoming increasingly aware in the struggle. Zhang Zhongliang's speech was interrupted again and again by the crowd's loud slogans.

The masses warmly welcomed the speech by Denisov, the representative of Soviet experts in the Gansu region. Denisov said: The imperialists cannot scare the Soviet people or the people of any country in the socialist camp, and all honest people in the world sympathize with and support us.

Deng Baoshan, representative of the democratic parties of Gansu Province, then spoke. He sternly condemned the criminal acts of American imperialism. He pointed out that this perverse act of American imperialism will never save it from its declining fate, but will only accelerate its demise.

Wu Hongbin, Vice Chairman of the Gansu Provincial Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, Wang Jun, Chairman of the Gansu Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, and representatives of workers, peasants, and students also spoke at the meeting.

After the meeting, a massive demonstration was held. Wang Shengqiang, who had won a Second Class Merit in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, stood at the forefront of the team, holding his rifle high. He clenched his fist and said: "I personally witnessed the inhuman crimes of American imperialism in Korea. Now it is going crazy everywhere. We must unite and drive American imperialism out of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and defend world peace!"

    兰州六十万人示威
    支持苏联严正立场　痛斥美国帝国主义
    据新华社兰州23日电　兰州市各族各界人民六十万人，22日举行了空前规模的游行示威和集会，支持苏联的正义立场，愤怒谴责美帝国主义破坏四国首脑会议。
    从早晨开始，激怒的工人、农民、干部、学生、市民、民兵和解放军战士，抬着标语牌、漫画牌，举着各种旗帜，浩浩荡荡地涌进各个会场。大街小巷人流如潮，旗帜成林，拥护苏联政府严正立场、反对美帝国主义破坏四国首脑会议的口号声震动全城。
    有十万人参加了在中心会场举行的群众大会。
    甘肃省和兰州市党政领导人、驻军首长、各民主党派地方组织和各人民团体的负责人，参加了大会。在兰州的苏联专家和匈牙利专家等也参加了大会。
    中共甘肃省委第一书记张仲良在全场激昂的口号声中开始讲话。他说：甘肃省一千四百万人民同全国人民一道，坚决拥护苏联对四国首脑会议所采取的严正立场。张仲良说：豺狼终究是豺狼，美帝国主义侵略苏联，破坏四国首脑会议，加剧国际紧张局势，这是帝国主义本性的必然表现，是不难一目了然的。而美帝国主义及其帮凶——现代修正主义分子，竟然颠倒黑白，混淆是非，妄图把美帝国主义破坏四国首脑会议的责任推卸到苏联头上，这完全是流氓手法，欺骗不了在斗争中日益觉悟起来的各国人民。张仲良的讲话，一次又一次地被群众响亮的口号声打断。
    群众热烈欢迎甘肃地区苏联专家代表杰尼索夫讲话。杰尼索夫说：帝国主义者吓不倒苏联人民和社会主义阵营任何一国的人民，世界上一切正直的人都同情和支持我们。
    甘肃省各民主党派代表邓宝珊接着讲话。他严厉谴责了美帝国主义的罪恶行为。他指出，美帝国主义的这种倒行逆施，决不会挽救它没落的命运，而只会加速它的死亡。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会甘肃省分会副主席吴鸿宾、甘肃省工会主席王俊以及工人、农民、学生等代表都在会上讲了话。
    会后举行了声势浩大的示威游行。曾在抗美援朝战争中立过二等功的王生强，高举步枪站在队伍的最前列，他握紧拳头说：“我在朝鲜亲眼看到美帝国主义惨无人道的罪行，现在它又在到处发疯，我们一定要团结起来，把美帝国主义赶出亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲去，保卫世界和平！”
