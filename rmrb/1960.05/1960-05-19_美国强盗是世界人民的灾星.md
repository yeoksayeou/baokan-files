American Bandits are a Scourge to the People of the World
Qian Saimei, Worker at Shanghai Bicycle Factory No. 2

Trees have roots, water has a source. Imperialism is the root of all wars, because they rely on sucking blood to get rich and start wars. Wherever they go, they establish military bases, raise a group of lackeys and puppet groups that oppress the people, ride on the backs of the common people, and act extremely viciously, leaving the people with no good days. They deprive the people of their freedom and right to survival, and they create international tensions and the threat of war. Especially American imperialism, it uses the banner of peace, engaging in "security treaties" in the east and military blocs and military bases in the west, vainly attempting to dominate the whole world. Therefore, it desperately supports the other imperialist countries' frenzied attacks on national liberation movements, and supports reactionary groups that enslave and oppress the people. It uses all kinds of vicious provocative acts to undermine world peace. If American imperialism does not roll out, the threat of war cannot be eliminated for a single day, and the people cannot be free from disasters and completely liberated.

The Japanese people have awakened. They have suffered greatly from the heavy oppression of American imperialism and understand that this "ally," who speaks so eloquently, is actually a vampire, wanting to suck the blood of the Japanese people dry before stopping. Fine, if you want to oppress, we will fight. Tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions, millions of people have taken to the streets, and more and more people are joining in, demanding the abolition of that bloody new "security treaty," demanding that Nobusuke Kishi be driven out of office, and demanding that the American devils be driven back to their homeland!

The heroic South Korean people have awakened and overthrown the Syngman Rhee reactionary group that the United States single-handedly supported. American imperialism then brought out Huh Chung, who is called Syngman Rhee the Second, and hung up the sign of a "caretaker cabinet," while deceptively clamoring for "renovating state affairs" and "political reform," while actively reorganizing its organization and establishing an "anti-communist section," attempting to soften the people's fighting will, strengthen the suppression of patriots, and save American imperialism's colonial rule in South Korea.

The Turkish people have also awakened. They want to overthrow the dictatorship and overthrow the reactionary Turkish government. The American devils, however, revealed a fierce face, actively supporting the Turkish dictatorial government behind the scenes and bloody suppressing the people's just struggle.

A robber is always a robber, and will never automatically turn over a new leaf. You see, on the eve of the Four-Power Summit, the American reactionaries were again sending reconnaissance planes to sneak into the airspace of the powerful Soviet Union to provoke them, in order to achieve the vicious purpose of attacking the socialist camp and undermining peace.

These evil tricks of American imperialism will only arouse great indignation among the people of the world, only ignite higher flames of struggle, and only suffer miserable failures. The just struggles of the people of South Korea, Japan, and Turkey, and the downfall of Syngman Rhee, the lackey supported by the United States, are exactly what Chairman Mao said, "The life of imperialism will not be very long. They have done all kinds of bad things, and all the oppressed people in the world will never forgive them." This is because the awakened people have recognized that imperialism is a great scourge to the people of the whole world and a common enemy, and they have all risen up to oppose it and must overthrow it. At the same time, the fact that the people's struggle has continuously achieved victories has also exposed that American imperialism is not terrible. We people of the world must not be intimidated by the military force of American imperialism, nor should we lightly believe their sweet words, nor should we have unrealistic illusions about imperialism. We should see clearly the nature of imperialism, see clearly the true face of the wars of aggression they are carrying out under the guise of peace. Marxism-Leninism tells us: war is the inevitable product of capitalism. American imperialism is the scourge of all peace-loving people in the world. If we want to defend lasting world peace, we must unite and direct the spearhead of struggle at American imperialism.

Judging from the current situation, imperialism has reached the point of running out of breath. The objective laws of historical development also tell us that the development of imperialism can only lead to a dead end. As long as we persist in the struggle to the end, the final victory will surely belong to us peace-loving people of the world. This is just as Chairman Mao said, the people are the deciding factor. Relying on the unity and struggle of the people, we will surely be able to defeat imperialism and their lackeys and achieve lasting world peace.

    美国强盗是世界人民的灾星
    上海自行车二厂工人　钱赛梅
    树有根，水有源。帝国主义是一切战争的根源，因为它们是依靠吸血致富、战争起家的。它们到了哪里，就在哪里建立军事基地，养上一批压迫人民的走狗和傀儡集团，骑在老百姓头上，穷凶极恶，弄得人民没有好日子过。它们剥夺了人民自由和生存的权利，它制造国际紧张局势和战争威胁。尤其是美帝国主义，他打着和平的招牌，东搞“安全条约”，西搞军事集团、军事基地，妄想霸占全世界。因此，它竭力地支持着其他帝国主义国家对民族解放运动的疯狂进攻，并扶植奴役压迫人民的反动集团。它用种种恶毒的挑衅行为，破坏世界和平。美帝国主义一天不滚出去，战争的威胁就一天不能消除，人民就不能消灾除难，彻底解放。
    日本人民觉悟起来了。他们吃了美帝国主义重重压迫的苦头，懂得这个口口声声说得天花乱坠的什么“盟友”，原来是个吸血鬼，想把日本人民的血吸干了才罢休。好，你要压迫，我们就要斗争。几万、十几万、几十万、几百万人上了街，越来越多的人跟上来，要废除那个充满血腥气的新“安全条约”，要把岸信介赶下台，要把美国佬打回老家去！
    英勇的南朝鲜人民觉悟起来了，把美国一手扶植起来的李承晚反动集团赶下台。美帝国主义又搬出了被叫做李承晚第二的许政，挂起了“看守内阁”的牌子，一面欺骗性的叫嚷“刷新国政”、“政治改革”，一面在积极的整顿组织，成立“反共科”，企图软化人民的斗争意志，加强对爱国者的镇压，挽救美帝国主义在南朝鲜的殖民统治地位。
    土耳其人民也觉悟起来了。他们要打倒独裁，要推翻土耳其的反动政府。美国佬呢，露出一副凶神面孔，在幕后积极支持土耳其独裁政府，血腥镇压人民正义斗争。
    强盗总归是强盗，什么时候也不会自动改邪归正。你看，在四国首脑会议召开前夕，美国反动派又在向强大的苏联派侦察机偷偷摸摸地侵入领空进行挑衅，以达到恶毒的攻击社会主义阵营和破坏和平的目的。
    美帝国主义这些罪恶的鬼把戏，只会引起全世界人民极大的愤慨，只会烧起更高的斗争烈火，只会遭到狼狈的失败。现在南朝鲜、日本、土耳其人民的正义斗争，美国扶植的走狗李承晚的下台，正应了毛主席所说的话，“帝国主义的寿命不会很长了，他们做尽了坏事，全世界一切受压迫的人民决不会饶恕他们。”这是因为已经觉醒了的人民，认清了帝国主义是全世界人民的大灾星，是共同的敌人，都纷纷起来反对它，非把它打倒不可。同时从人民斗争不断取得胜利的事实，也暴露了美帝国主义并不可怕。我们全世界人民不要在美帝武力面前吓住，也不要轻信它们的花言巧语，更不要对帝国主义存有不切实际的幻想。我们应当看清帝国主义的本性，看清它们在和平的幌子下所进行的侵略战争的真面目。马克思列宁主义告诉我们：战争是资本主义的必然产物。美帝国主义就是我们全世界爱好和平人民的灾星。我们要保卫世界的持久和平，就一定要团结起来，把斗争的锋芒指向美帝国主义。
    从现在局势看，帝国主义已经到了快断气的时候了。历史的客观发展规律也告诉我们，帝国主义的发展，结果只有死路一条。只要我们坚持斗争到底，最后的胜利一定属于我们全世界爱好和平的人民。这正如毛主席所说，人民是决定的因素。依靠人民的团结和斗争，一定能战胜帝国主义和他们的走狗，取得世界的持久和平。
