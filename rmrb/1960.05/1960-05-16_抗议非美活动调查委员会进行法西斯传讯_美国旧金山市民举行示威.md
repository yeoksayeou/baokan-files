Xinhua News Agency, May 14th, San Francisco Dispatch: San Francisco police authorities used water cannons yesterday against demonstrators at City Hall, protesting the fascist subpoenas being conducted there by the House Un-American Activities Committee.

The infamous House Un-American Activities Committee has launched another political persecution. The committee is currently "investigating Communism in Northern California." Subpoenas have been issued to fourteen California residents, including several teachers.

During yesterday's subpoenas, two hundred people demonstrated at City Hall, protesting the illegal subpoenas. Police authorities radioed for motorcycle police, who used fire engines to turn water cannons on the demonstrators. Many demonstrators were soaked, but they stood their ground despite the police brutality.

Later, the police began using force to disperse them and brought in patrol cars to haul away the demonstrators. According to reports, two demonstrators were injured by the police, and others were beaten with batons.

The House Un-American Activities Committee's resumption of activities has sparked widespread protests in the United States. Congressman James Roosevelt, son of former President Roosevelt, called the committee an institution that undermines human dignity and constitutional rights.

To protest these reactionary activities, a Committee to Defend Human Freedom has been established in San Francisco. Members of this committee distributed leaflets protesting the activities of the McCarthyites.

Students at the University of California and San Francisco College are preparing to hold protest rallies.

The new wave of anti-Communist hysteria has also been protested by the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, the Northern California Civil Liberties Union, the San Francisco Federation of Teachers, the Northern California Friends Committee on Legislation, and many other groups.

Xinhua News Agency, May 15th, San Francisco Dispatch: A large demonstration of over 1,500 people erupted in San Francisco yesterday, protesting the fascist subpoenas conducted there by a "Un-American Activities" subcommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives.

This is the second consecutive day of mass demonstrations against the fascist subpoenas. Yesterday, as the subcommittee held its third hearing on "Communist activities," more than 1,500 angry citizens gathered in front of City Hall to protest the fascist investigation. Demonstrators held signs reading: "Abolish this Committee," "Abolish Thought Control," "Abolish Police State Terror." Demonstrators set up picket lines around the City Hall building and listened to the proceedings of the "hearing" through loudspeakers.

A San Francisco longshoreman named Brown, who was subpoenaed, read a statement in front of City Hall, strongly condemning the U.S. authorities' actions. He pointed out that the activities of the "Un-American Activities" subcommittee itself were "Un-American." Brown was unreasonably ejected from the hearing for three consecutive days for arguing with the subcommittee chairman. Many other subpoenaed individuals protested by refusing to answer questions.

At the start of yesterday's demonstration, San Francisco Police Chief Cahill personally led more than 100 police officers, plainclothes police, mounted police, and motorcycle police to the scene to suppress it. After the police used violence, demonstrators clashed with the police, and three demonstrators were arrested.

In a demonstration on the 13th, more than 200 demonstrators also clashed with the police. Authorities immediately used radio calls to bring in motorcycle police to suppress it. Police used water cannons to attack the demonstrators, who fought with the police and refused to leave. Twelve people were injured and sixty-six were arrested.

    抗议非美活动调查委员会进行法西斯传讯
    美国旧金山市民举行示威
    新华社14日讯　旧金山消息：旧金山警察当局昨天用水龙对付在市政厅举行示威的群众，这些人抗议众议院非美活动调查委员会正在那里进行的法西斯传讯。
    恶名昭著的非美活动调查委员会又发动了一次政治迫害。这个委员会目前“正在北加利福尼亚调查共产主义”。已经向包括若干教员在内的十四个加利福尼亚居民发出了传审通知。
    在昨天进行传讯的时候，有两百人在市政厅示威，抗议非法传讯，警察当局用无线电召来了摩托警察，他们用救火车向示威者开放水龙。许多示威者被浇得浑身湿漉漉的，但是他们不顾警察的这种暴行，仍然站着不走。
    后来警察又开始用武力驱散他们，并且开来了一些巡逻车，企图把示威者装走。据报道，有两个示威者被警察打伤，还有一些人遭到了棒打。
    非美活动调查委员会恢复活动，已经在美国引起了广泛的抗议。国会议员、前总统罗斯福的儿子詹姆斯·罗斯福把这个委员会称为破坏人类尊严和宪法权利的机构。
    为了抗议这些反动活动，已经在旧金山设立了一个保卫人类自由委员会。这个委员会的会员散发了抗议麦卡锡分子的活动的传单。
    加利福尼亚大学和旧金山学院的学生们正在准备举行抗议集会。
    新的反共歇斯底里的浪潮还受到国际码头与仓库工人工会、北加利福尼亚公民自由联盟、旧金山教师联合会、北加利福尼亚教友立法委员会和许多其他团体的抗议。
    新华社15日讯　旧金山消息：旧金山昨天爆发了一千五百多人的大示威，抗议美国国会众议院的一个“非美活动”调查小组委员会在那里进行的法西斯传讯。
    这已是连续第二天发生群众示威抗议法西斯传讯。昨天，当这个小组委员会正在举行第三次关于“共产党活动”的传讯时，一千五百多名愤怒的群众聚集在市政厅前面举行示威，抗议这一法西斯调查活动。示威群众手里举着标语牌，上面写着：“取消这个委员会”、“取消思想控制”、“取消警察国家的恐怖活动”。示威者在市政厅建筑物的周围布置了纠察线，并且通过扩音器听着“意见听取会”的进程。
    一个被传讯的名叫布朗的旧金山码头工人，在市政厅前宣读了一项声明，强烈谴责美国当局的这一行动。他指出这个“非美活动”调查小组委员会本身的活动就是“非美的”。布朗由于在传讯会上同小组委员会主席进行辩论，接连三天都被无理地推出会场。其他许多被传讯的人都以拒绝回答问题表示抗议。
    在昨天示威开始时，旧金山市警察局长卡希尔亲自率领一百多名警官、便衣警察、骑警和摩托警车驰赴现场镇压。在警察施用暴力后，示威群众同警察发生冲突，有三名示威者被警察逮捕。
    在13日的一次示威中，二百多名示威者也同警察发生了冲突。当局立即用无线电话召来摩托警车进行镇压。警察用水龙头冲击示威群众，示威者同警察展开搏斗，坚持不肯离去。有十二人被打伤，六十六人被捕。
