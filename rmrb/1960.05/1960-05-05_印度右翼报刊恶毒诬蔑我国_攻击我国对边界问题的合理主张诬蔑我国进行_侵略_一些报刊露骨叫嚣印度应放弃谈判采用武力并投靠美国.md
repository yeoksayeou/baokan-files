Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 4th: Following the talks between the Prime Ministers of China and India, some right-wing newspapers in India have launched a wave of slander against China.

On April 27th, the "Indian Express" put forward a vicious slogan: "Hindi-Chini, Bye-Bye" (Indians and Chinese, Goodbye). It openly stated, "No matter how strongly Zhou Enlai defends China's eternal friendship with India, Sino-Indian relations will never return to the idyllic era of Panchsheel and the Bandung spirit." The "United India" newspaper on April 30th falsely accused China of becoming "the greatest enemy of peace," a "nation that violates promises," and a "nation that does not keep its word." Publications such as "Glory" and "Flame" weekly issued delirious claims that China is a "new imperialism" and "expansionism."

These newspapers viciously attacked China's reasonable claims on the border issue, insisting on the fallacy that China has "occupied a large area of Ladakh territory." "The Statesman" falsely accused China of "occupying large tracts of Indian territory by force" and "committing aggression against India." At the same time, this newspaper also falsely accused China's proposal for a comprehensive solution to the entire border as "conducting a transaction." It insisted on India's territorial claims to the Aksai Chin region, part of Chinese Xinjiang and Tibet. The "Hindustan Times" attacked Premier Zhou Enlai's proposal to resolve the Sino-Indian border dispute using the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung spirit, calling this "sweet talk" and a "deliberate distortion of facts." Editorials in the "Times of India" and "The Statesman" on April 27th both opposed the meeting of officials from the two countries as stipulated in the Sino-Indian Prime Ministers' joint communique. The "Times of India" said, "Maps and documents cannot solve the border problem." "What New Delhi needs is not documentary evidence, but policy." This newspaper said: "Nehru has told the nation to live with the China problem indefinitely, and since this is the case, New Delhi itself should set an example and proceed openly and firmly to live with this problem indefinitely, without engaging in any futile and fruitless negotiations." This newspaper acknowledged that China seeks a genuine relaxation of the situation, but it believes that India should not do so, saying, "Any genuine relaxation of tension will be in Beijing's interests." "The Statesman," in its commentary on the 28th, emphasized that "the Sino-Indian border dispute may last for decades."

Some newspapers even more blatantly advocated abandoning negotiations and resorting to force, relying on the United States, and abandoning the non-alignment policy. A newspaper in Kerala called "Friend of the Poor" said menacingly, "The sword should not be left in its scabbard, but should be held in hand and constantly maintained vigilance on the border." The "Searchlight," part of the Birla newspaper group, one of India's press barons, shamelessly said on April 27th, "Now is the time for us to take full advantage of our newly acquired understanding with Uncle Sam and ask the United States for help in eliminating China's shameful aggression, should the Beijing talks also fail (as is likely)." A newspaper called "New India," while vilifying China as an "aggressor," advocated taking police measures "together with friendly Western countries" to drive away the "aggressor."

    印度右翼报刊恶毒诬蔑我国
    攻击我国对边界问题的合理主张诬蔑我国进行“侵略”
    一些报刊露骨叫嚣印度应放弃谈判采用武力并投靠美国
    新华社4日讯　新德里消息：在中印两国总理会谈结束以后，印度的一些右翼报刊掀起一个污蔑中国的浪潮。
    4月27日“印度快报”提出一个恶毒的口号：“印地秦尼拜，拜”（印中人民再见）。它公然说，“不论周恩来多么大力保卫中国对印度的永恒友谊，中印关系永远不会回复到潘查希拉和万隆精神的那种田园诗式的时代。”4月30日的“团结报”诬蔑中国已成为“和平最大的敌人”、“违背诺言的国家”和“不守义的国家”。“荣耀报”、“火焰”周刊等发出了中国是“新帝国主义”、“扩张主义”之类的呓语。
    这些报刊恶毒地攻击中国在边界问题上的合理主张，坚持所谓中国“侵占了拉达克大块领土”的谬论。“政治家报”诬蔑中国“以武力占领大块的印度领土”，“对印度进行了侵略”。同时，这家报纸还把中国在全面解决全部边界的主张诬蔑成是“进行交易”。它坚持印度对中国新疆、西藏一部分的阿克赛钦地区的领土要求。“印度斯坦时报”攻击周恩来总理希望用和平共处五项原则和万隆精神来解决中印边界争端的主张，把这说成是“甜言蜜语”，“深思熟虑地歪曲事实”。“印度时报”和“政治家报”4月27日的社论都反对中印两国总理的联合公报中规定的两国官员会晤。“印度时报”说，“地图和文件是无法解决边界问题的”。“新德里所需要的不是文献证据，而是政策。”这家报纸说：“尼赫鲁已经告诉全国人民要在无限期的存在着中国问题的情况下生活下去，既然这样，新德里自己应当树立一个榜样，着手公开地、坚定不移地在无限期的存在着这个问题的情况下生活下去，不要进行什么徒劳无益的无结果的谈判”。这家报纸承认中国谋求局势的真正缓和，但它认为印度不应当这样做，它说，“紧张局势的任何真正缓和将是附合北京的利益的”。“政治家报”在28日的评论中强调说，“中印边界争端可能持续好几十年”。
    一些报刊甚至更加露骨地主张不要谈判而采用武力，投靠美国，放弃不结盟政策。喀拉拉邦有家叫做“穷人之友报”的报纸杀气腾腾地说，“不应当把宝剑插在剑鞘里，而应当拿在手上，并且在边界上不断保持戒备”。印度报阀之一的比拉报系的“探照灯报”4月27日竟恬不知耻地说，“现在是时候了，我们应该充分利用我们同山姆大叔新近求得的谅解，请求美国给予帮助，以便一旦北京的会谈也遭到失败（很可能失败），就设法消除中国的可耻侵略。”一家叫做“新印度”的报纸，在污蔑中国是“侵略者”的同时，主张“同友好的西方国家”一起采取警察措施，把“侵略者”赶走。
