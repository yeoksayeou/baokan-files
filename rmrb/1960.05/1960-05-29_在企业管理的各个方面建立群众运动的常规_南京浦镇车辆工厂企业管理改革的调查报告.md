    Establish Mass Movement Routines in All Aspects of Enterprise Management
    Investigation Report on Enterprise Management Reform at Nanjing Puzhen Rolling Stock Factory
    Industrial Department of the Nanjing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China

    Nanjing Puzhen Rolling Stock Factory is a medium-sized old factory that has been mainly engaged in passenger and freight car repairs for over fifty years. Since the Great Leap Forward, it has developed into a manufacturing-oriented enterprise, combining repair and manufacturing. The factory has over 6,000 employees, twelve workshops, and sixteen departments. Based on current production capacity, the factory can produce 1,800 freight cars, 720 passenger cars, 54,000 tons of steel, and 60,000 cast iron wheels annually. In 1959, the factory's production increased month by month, comprehensively exceeding the national plan and becoming a national red banner unit. Since the beginning of this year, the factory has launched a vigorous upsurge of technological innovation and revolution. In the first quarter, the factory established 15 production lines, 5 automatic lines, and implemented over 2,000 innovation projects that increased work efficiency by one to ten times. Compared with the same period last year, the total output value increased by 1.18 times, steel increased by 7.9 times, freight cars increased by 10.2 times, cast iron wheels increased by 21 times, passenger car repairs increased by 4.9 times, and labor productivity increased by 2.36 times. Due to its significant achievements, it has won the mobile red banner of the inter-factory competition organized by the Ministry of Railways every month.

    Technological Revolution and Production Development Require Continuous Reform of Enterprise Management

    The wave of technological innovation and revolution has accelerated the development of productive forces and also requires corresponding continuous changes in the factory's enterprise management. The basic requirement of this change is to establish mass movement routines in all aspects of enterprise management, so that enterprise management can continuously improve, perfect, and promote the development of productive forces along with the rising tide of mass movements in production.

    Since 1958, the Puzhen Rolling Stock Factory has established a set of management organizations, methods, and systems that are basically suitable for the continuous leap forward in production. In particular, after earnestly implementing the experience of "two participations, one reform, and three combinations," more than 80% of the work groups in the factory have consistently adhered to team and group management, establishing a foundation for mass management. Especially since the Great Leap Forward, a large number of leading cadres, engineering technicians, and department staff from worker backgrounds have been promoted. Worker cadres account for 83% of the factory-level cadres, 80% of the department heads, workshop directors, and branch secretaries, and 53% of the engineering and technical cadres. They come from production, are familiar with production, come from the masses, are familiar with the masses, are loyal to the cause of the Party, are courageous and responsible, and dare to break with the old and establish the new. With such a professional management organization dominated by worker cadres, coupled with the mass base of more than 80% of the work groups adhering to team and group management mentioned above, extremely favorable conditions have been created for continuously improving enterprise management.

    After technological innovation and revolution entered a new stage, a series of new and higher requirements were put forward for department work: with workshops innovating in lines and areas, department work must correspondingly strengthen organization and planning; information must be readily available to solve new problems arising in the movement in a timely manner; make department work coordinate as a whole to continuously organize new balances. At the same time, tool management must also be innovated to rapidly improve work efficiency. However, in the beginning, many department cadres in this factory did not have a sufficient understanding of this new situation. They treated constantly changing things with a passive balancing view. For example, when fitters had rapidly developed from single innovation to large-scale mechanization, the technical department was still designing individual machine tools. The shaper fixture and pneumatic wrench they spent a lot of time designing were sent to the workshop, but the workers had already made more efficient machine tools themselves. For another example, the welding of freight car underframes changed three times in just one month: first, manual welding was changed to automatic welding, then to non-electric welding, and soon more advanced lying welding was successfully trial-produced, but the materials department was unable to keep up with the development of the movement in time, and was busy coping with the situation, putting the work in a passive position. There were also many cases of buck-passing in management work in various departments. For example, in the inspection of freight car parts—axle boxes—due to the inconsistent pressure test standards between the component workshop and the freight car workshop, rework and scrapping often occurred due to air leaks, which greatly affected production. The workshop constantly asked the technical department to solve this problem, but the technical department turned the problem over to the inspection department. The inspection department said: "This is not within our scope of responsibility." The workers in the freight car workshop urged them a dozen times in a row, but there was still no solution.

    The contradiction between department work not keeping up with the development of technological innovation and revolution became increasingly prominent. The mass movement in the workshop was in full swing, but the departments were deserted. The workshop changed several times a day, and the situation became more and more pressing. The department staff became more and more depressed, and they urgently demanded to get rid of this passive state and reform the work of the departments.

    Departments, Workshops, and Groups Launch a Three-Level "One-Dragon" Competition, Reforming Management Work in the Mass Movement

    The factory Party committee paid timely attention to this situation. They realized that technological innovation and revolution are not only a production movement, but also a political and ideological movement; the various functional departments of the enterprise are the staff headquarters for the Party committee to lead production, and are the link between top and bottom and between left and right in the enterprise. The relationship between departments and workshops and between departments is an important aspect of the production relations in the enterprise. If the work of the departments cannot keep up with the needs of the development of the situation and cannot keep up with the torrent of the mass movement, the technological revolution will be blocked in the department link, and the continuous leap forward in production will inevitably be hindered. Therefore, the factory Party committee, on the one hand, called on the department staff to devote themselves wholeheartedly to the hot mass movement, and on the other hand, used the moving examples of workshops making technological innovation and revolution to educate department cadres, in order to promote a major reform of department work.

    In reforming department work, the factory's central tool room first made remarkable achievements. Together with the management personnel of the workshops and groups, they participated in the factory's technological revolution games, and put forward the "four comparisons" competition of comparing whether the accounts match the materials, whether the distribution of tools is fast, whether the problems are dealt with in time, and whether the tools are clean, in response to the main problems existing in tool management, and made a live performance at the technological revolution games. After the meeting, they continued to organize a three-level one-dragon competition between departments, workshops, and groups, continuously summarizing and promoting advanced experiences, so that the tool room changed from a deserted place to a bustling place, and the work face was completely new. In the past, the central tool room was very passive in the supply of tools. Now they have completely changed their working methods, and creatively organized "tool competitions" in combination with the technological revolution games, concentrating on various advanced tools created or improved by the workers, performing on the spot, competing on the spot, exchanging experiences on the spot, and organizing promotion on the spot. After the competition, the most advanced tools were put on display in the workshop. At the same time, they also created a cutting machine, which can cut various shapes of tools at any time; they also set up a sharpening room to actively sharpen tools for workers, which is also very popular with the masses. In this way, the work of the central tool room got rid of the passive situation and stood at the forefront of the technological innovation and revolution movement, becoming an active promoter.

    The experience of the central tool room in reforming management work using the mass movement method has set a good example for departments to carry out mass movements. The factory Party committee immediately seized this advanced experience and vigorously promoted it in all departments. The three-level one-dragon competition of all professional management systems in the factory was quickly organized, and each department had different competition content and forms. For example, through the technological revolution games, the technical department first summarized the advanced operating experience of the workers, and compiled 172 process documents after the department's appraisal. This work had not been done in the past few years, but now it was done in less than a month. The production planning department organized a "three diligence" and "four quick" one-dragon competition, that is, diligence in analysis, diligence in contact, diligence in supervision and inspection, quick in finding problems, quick in contact, quick in reflection, and quick in decision. In the past, the production progress of the day could not be known until the next day, but now the production progress is summarized every two hours. The inspection department, which was once described by workers as "blocking the back door," has also changed its style of only grasping the tail and not grasping the head, only managing inspection and not asking about production. The inspection cadres at all levels worked together to analyze product quality with the workers from the first process and jointly study measures, and vigorously carried out technological innovation and revolution. In this way, not only was the quality of the products effectively improved, but the relationship between the inspectors and the workers was greatly improved. Through the three-level one-dragon competition, a mass movement to reform enterprise management was launched throughout the factory. Department staff went out of the office, went deep into the grassroots, went deep into production, went deep into the masses, served the movement, participated in the movement, and promoted the movement. In the past two months, a set of relatively flexible, scientific, and reasonable management systems suitable for the great development of production technology has been preliminarily established from departments, workshops, and groups, which has powerfully promoted the continuous great leap forward in production.

    The result of carrying out mass movements and competitions in management work not only adapted to the requirements of technological innovation and revolution, and changed from passive to active, but more importantly, further adjusted the relationship between people within the enterprise. For example, Wang Zhaobao, a technician in the technical department, did not dare to go to the workshop in the past because he could not put down his airs and was afraid that people would look down on him. Sometimes when he went to the workshop, he would either point fingers or ask for this and that, and the workers would feel uncomfortable when they saw him. This time, in the process of adjusting the freight car production line, because he changed his style, ate in the workshop, slept in the workshop, and helped the workers solve several key technical problems in production in time, he was welcomed and loved by the workers. Once, the freight car workshop urgently needed to carry out lying welding, but lacked people to draw the drawings, so he took the initiative to undertake it and drew the drawings after working hard day and night. The workers were very satisfied and said: "We need such technicians." Now, Wang Zhaobao goes to the workshop every day, and he feels uneasy if he does not go for a day, and the workers miss him if they do not see him for a day. Wang Zhaobao's example of changing his style is also a portrayal of many department cadres. People have made a comparison between the relationship between departments and workshops in the past and the present: in the past, it was "blocking the back door," now it is "prevention first"; in the past, it was "dragging the hind legs," now it is a pioneer; in the past, it was each singing its own tune and bickering, now it is singing a leap forward song together; in the past, it was quarreling and "fighting lawsuits"; now it is beating gongs and drums to send good news.

    Department Cadres Are Not Only Administrative Workers, But Also Political Workers, Not Only To Do a Good Job in Technical Management, But Also To Do a Good Job in Organizational Work

    While launching a three-level one-dragon competition between departments, workshops, and groups, a heated competition movement was also launched within departments and between departments. Contests, games, performances, etc. have become working methods often used by department. Many department cadres have begun to understand that they should not only be administrative workers, but also political workers, and must not only do a good job in technical management, but also do a good job in organizational work. Taking the materials department as an example, this department only focused on practical work in the past and did not focus on theoretical work. The working method was "passive balance" and "doing things according to regulations," and the workers called it the "dragging hind legs" department. After rectification and anti-rightist movement and vigorously carrying out mass movements, the situation is now completely different. The whole department, up and down, inside and out, has established a set of political work systems, and the work in all aspects is done very well. In the case of very tight raw material supply, they put forward the slogan of "finding material sources in every possible way and ensuring high yield by all means." In February this year, the factory planned to build 130 new freight cars, and their proposed supply target was to guarantee 150 cars and strive for 190 cars; in March, the factory's production plan was 150 cars, and they guaranteed the supply of materials for 200 cars. In order to continuously boost morale, the entire department launched a "three-dragon" competition between internal business groups, external procurement stations, and workshop material clerks. For the 58 purchasers distributed in 15 provinces and cities across the country, measures such as establishing joint procurement stations, implementing daily contact, and monthly evaluation were adopted to strengthen leadership. In daily work, they often "grasp the two ends" and carry out in-depth and meticulous ideological education. For example, the procurement personnel of the Northeast procurement station have sufficient enthusiasm and good unity. They completed their tasks ten days ahead of schedule in January and February, and the materials department promptly praised them and established a benchmark. The procurement personnel of the Shanghai procurement station did not complete the procurement task in January due to disunity. They seized the opportunity of the Spring Festival when the purchasers returned to the factory, organized theoretical discussions, and solved ideological problems. As a result, the Shanghai procurement station jumped to become a winning group in February and March. Recently, they found that the personnel of the Shanghai procurement station were somewhat arrogant and complacent, and were preparing to transfer them back for theoretical discussions. Because political and ideological work was closely grasped, many purchasers showed a high degree of revolutionary enthusiasm in their outbound work. For example, the purchaser who went to Changbai Mountain to purchase wood actively participated in labor when they saw that the labor force in the forest farm was tight, day after day, without complaint, which moved the local employees and masses very much, and actively helped him transport a large amount of wood from the mountain. Because the materials department adhered to putting politics in command and established a routine of carrying out mass movements, it completed several times the material procurement task of 1959 without increasing personnel.

    Carrying out mass movements in management departments has also greatly promoted the technological innovation of business work and improved work efficiency. Since the beginning of this year, according to the statistics of the factory's ten departments, a total of more than 1,600 management tool innovations and simplification of reports have been carried out. Among the 500 innovations implemented by the inspection department, more than 200 were advanced inspection tools, which increased inspection efficiency by about five times.

    Launching communist cooperation between departments is an important link in carrying out mass movements in enterprise management. The Puzhen Rolling Stock Factory has ten departments. Under the unified leadership of the Party committee, each department takes production as the center, focuses on the factory's overall plan and deployment, links up with each other, and acts jointly, achieving "each department is twisted into a rope." For example, in the process of establishing a freight car production line, the factory Party committee organized ten departments and four workshops of freight cars, transportation, capital construction, and repair and distribution, and conducted research, deployment, and clear division of labor through collaboration meetings. After the meeting, the engineers and technicians of the technical department immediately went deep into the workshop construction site, cooperated with the workshop director and technicians, extensively absorbed the opinions of the workers, and worked hard for fifteen days to formulate the freight car workshop adjustment plan and operation schedule. When the equipment department was carrying out machine tool modification, it found that the No. 22 factory building lacked two overhead cranes, so it took the initiative to use the old equipment to transform it. The materials department also took the initiative to deliver the materials needed by this workshop to the door, and mobilized the masses to find waste materials to meet the needs of the greatly increased production capacity after the production line was formed. After the production line was completed, a new management system was quickly established because the departments had made preparations in advance. The labor and wage department calculated the working hour quotas in one day, the financial accounting department calculated the cost reduction quotas within a week, and the personnel department also adjusted the labor force in time, ensuring the smooth flow of the production line.

    Carrying Out Mass Movements Has Given Enterprise Management a Broad Mass Base, Strengthened Combat Effectiveness, Organization, and Discipline, and Made the Leadership Style More In-Depth

    The result of continuously carrying out mass movements in enterprise management work has not only enriched the experience of management work, improved the level of management work, and fully exerted the functional role of professional departments, but also made the organization of enterprise management more and more strict, the system more and more sound, and the work more and more meticulous. The management departments of the factory and workshops have become not only the staff headquarters for the Party committee to manage the enterprise, but also the staff headquarters for the Party committee to carry out mass movements.

    Some people once worried that using the mass movement method to carry out management work would "mess up" production and "there would be no rules to follow." But the practice of Puzhen Rolling Stock Factory fully proves that doing so will not only not mess up, but on the contrary, make professional management more vigorous and orderly, and more completely establish a normal revolutionary order suitable for the rapid development of productive forces from top to bottom. The performance is:

    First, management work has a broader mass base. Department staff go deep into the workshop every day, are active on the front line of production, and work with the management personnel of workshops and groups, which makes the ears and eyes of the departments very sensitive, and they can almost reflect the production progress and new problems to the Party committee and the factory director at any time, so that management work can adapt to the rapidly changing situation. For example, the production planning department used to know the production progress every other day, and it was just a few dry reports, which could not fully reflect the specific activities and new problems in production. Now, according to the five major products of steel, freight cars, new passenger cars, repaired passenger cars, and cast iron wheels, a group of dispatchers are sent to patrol the production line all day long, reporting the production progress and problems every two hours. The department lists the information reflected by the dispatchers in a chart and uses indicator lines to show it, so that the entire factory's production is clear at a glance. If there are major, factory-wide problems, they are reported to the factory director in time, and the factory director convenes relevant departments to study and solve them. General problems are notified by the production planning department to the relevant departments or workshops to solve.

    Second, the combat effectiveness of enterprise management work has been strengthened. The intentions of the Party committee can reach the production groups on the same day through the Party branch and a strict management organization, and the situation of the groups can also be reflected in time. Daily management work is tense but not chaotic. The factory has established a system for analyzing economic activities on a daily basis from the Party committee to the departments, workshops, and even groups. The result of this layered analysis and upward and downward circulation is that the problems that need to be solved in production, technological innovation, and technological revolution can be implemented in the various production groups on the same day. At the same time, because the foundation of team and group management is strong, and the combination of top and bottom is very close, the initiative of management work is also strengthened. For example, the paint work area of the passenger car workshop carried out many technological innovations in early April, and production developed rapidly. By April 17, the group found that the prepared paint, which was originally enough for a month, only had a week's supply left, so they reported it to the material clerk of the workshop in time. The next day, the workshop director brought it to the factory's counterpart joint meeting. The factory director decided that the materials department should immediately notify the procurement in various places, while the technical department should cooperate with the workshop to study the use of substitutes. In the afternoon, relevant personnel of the materials department went to the workshop to verify the situation, and that night they notified the purchasers in Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places by telephone; at the same time, the technical department also started to test substitutes with the workshop the next day. Three days later, some procurement stations had negotiated a batch of goods, and the workshop substitutes had also been preliminarily tested successfully. In this way, the phenomenon of being rushed and flustered at the last minute, and even affecting the production progress, was avoided.

    Third, the organization and planning of management work have also been greatly strengthened. In the last ten days of each month, the factory adopts the method of "two ups and two downs" to compile and arrange the production plan for the next month. First, the production planning department proposes a preliminary monthly plan based on the overall plan and the opinions of various workshops, and submits it to the Party committee. The Party committee, based on the specific situation of the factory, compares the advanced technical indicators of the national vehicle factories, and initially determines the production indicators and major technological innovation projects, and makes a month's task deployment to the departments and workshops; the departments and workshops then formulate specific action plans with the implementation of the various indicators and technical organization measures (including major technological innovation projects) proposed by the Party committee as the center, and launch mass discussions on plans, contests, and performances in combination with monthly finals and evaluations; finally, the Party committee concentrates the opinions of the masses, revises and finalizes the plan, and then transmits it down level by level. In this stage, the departments and workshops also sign contact contracts to ensure production progress and the implementation of technological innovation projects, and the implementation of the contact contract regulations is used as the primary condition for competition evaluation. This series of activities not only closely organized the various links in production, but also fully mobilized the enthusiasm of the masses.

    Fourth, because management work penetrates into the mass movement and reflects problems sensitively, the factory's rules and regulations can be broken and established in a timely manner, so that the various systems are more sound and more adaptable to the needs of rapid development of productive forces. The correction of rules and regulations also fully implemented the mass line working method. For example, the tool room used to stipulate a "five-card" system for領取 tools, and workers could only領取 five tools a day. After the high tide of the technological revolution movement, the workers felt that five tools were not enough, and at the same time, because there were fewer advanced alloy tools, the workers were unwilling to return them on the same day after they領取 them, and the tool turnover was very slow. This time the workers suggested changing the five-card system to a multi-card system, with each person issuing a certain number of cards, including a main card and a secondary card. The main card can領取 advanced alloy tools, and the secondary card領取 general tools. The tools borrowed by the main card are borrowed on the same day and returned on the same day. In order to avoid errors, the workers also suggested that they print numbers on the main and secondary cards, and also print numbers on the tools, and "sit in the seat according to the number" when borrowing and exchanging tools. After doing so, the tool turnover speed was accelerated, the loss was less than in the past, and the workers were more convenient. Other departments, such as the materials department, have also further improved the material領取 card system, with cards at all levels from the group to the workshop and department, and often check them, which not only facilitates timely scheduling and guarantees needs, but also greatly saves materials.

    Fifth, the leadership style is more in-depth. After the factory determines the production task, the Party committee immediately organizes a working group, led by the Party secretary or the factory director, and absorbs the participation of relevant department cadres to go deep into the weak links and provide specific assistance. The general situation is that when the working group goes to a unit, it is a weak link. When the working group leaves, the unit has become an advanced benchmark. For example, the passenger car workshop did not complete the task well in January this year, so the Party secretary led the working group to help the workshop cadres clarify the division of labor and improve the leadership method. At the same time, they mobilized the masses to carry out dozens of major innovations, and completed the passenger car repair task four cars ahead of schedule that month, with low cost and good quality, and won the factory's mobile red banner.

    People used four "highs" to comprehensively summarize the new look of the management work of the Puzhen Rolling Stock Factory, that is: (1) high speed, high efficiency; (2) high degree of organization, discipline, and mass character; (3) high degree of communist style; (4) high degree of originality. These "four highs" mark a qualitative leap in the level of socialist enterprise management, and mark a new stage in the relationship between people within socialist enterprises.

    Taking Continuous Revolution and Active Balance as the Guiding Ideology, Making Department Work Mass-Oriented, and Integrating Enterprise Management and Mass Management

    The process of the Puzhen Rolling Stock Factory continuously strengthening and improving enterprise management work is also a process of continuous ideological struggle. Whether or not to have Party leadership and whether or not to vigorously carry out mass movements are the focus of the struggle. Since the "Double Anti" movement in 1958, the factory has experienced four major and concentrated political and ideological struggles. The first time was in April 1958, when the factory launched a mass movement of "two participations and one reform," thoroughly exposing and criticizing the idea of "system in command," breaking more than 800 unreasonable rules and regulations like a quick knife cutting through tangled hemp, and promoting team and group management and establishing a system for cadres to participate in labor while breaking and establishing new systems. The second time was during the Great Smelting of Steel, when the erroneous arguments that "politics in command cannot solve practical problems," "the Great Smelting of Steel is a waste of people and money," and "the combination of indigenous and foreign methods is a historical regression" were severely criticized. The third time was in March 1959, when the factory launched a two-month debate, thoroughly refuting the accounting faction's arguments such as "the pace of the Great Leap Forward is too big," "mass participation in management will inevitably be chaotic," and "there are no rules to follow after two participations and one reform." Later, after the great debate on "can we continue the Great Leap Forward" in the fourth quarter of 1959 and the first quarter of this year, the right-leaning ideas such as "production has reached the top, and potential has been exhausted" and "we cannot always engage in movements" and the demand for a breather were criticized, and the great victories of "red to the end" in 1959 and "good start" and "red every month" this year were achieved. Through these several large-scale ideological struggles, coupled with the promotion of technological innovation and revolution movements, the Puzhen Rolling Stock Factory has established a routine of carrying out mass movements under the absolute leadership of the Party in all aspects of enterprise management, and the system of "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" has therefore had richer content:

    (1) Many cadres, especially workshop-level cadres, not only participate in physical labor regularly, but have actually made the workshop their home, eating in the workshop, sleeping in the workshop, and working in the workshop as usual. The participation of leading backbones in physical labor has been closely integrated with "grasping the two ends." Wherever the weakest link is in production, a working group composed of leading backbones will appear there. They participate in labor on the one hand, and solve key problems in production on the other, which has achieved remarkable results.

    (2) In terms of workers' participation in management, it has a broader mass character. Many production groups have formed a core group of Party members, group leaders, and some veteran workers, with technicians, planning dispatchers, quota accountants, propagandists, inspectors, material clerks, safety and health workers, and tool keepers as the backbone, organizing every worker to participate in management work. After two years of practice, especially through the three-level one-dragon competition, and continuously summarizing and promoting the experience of team and group management, the level of workers' participation in management has been greatly improved.

    (3) In terms of reforming rules and regulations, because the three-level management personnel meet in the workshop every day, the whole factory is in communication, and any rationalization suggestions from the employees can be quickly reflected and resolved in a timely manner. At the same time, the work of reforming rules and regulations has been closely integrated with the competition of the three-level management departments. Backward rules and regulations are constantly broken, and rules and regulations that promote production are constantly established. This phenomenon has become a routine.

    (4) The "three combinations" of leading cadres, workers, and engineering technicians not only appear in breaking through production keys, trial-producing new products, and realizing major innovation projects, but have also run through the daily activities of production. In the past, many engineering technicians only "breathed" with the workers during the "three combinations." Now, general engineering technicians spend at least half of their time in the workshop every day. Everyone gets along day and night, and consults on everything, achieving "natural ventilation."

    The enterprise management system and management method of the Puzhen Rolling Stock Factory was produced on the basis of vigorously carrying out mass movements, and is guided by the ideology of continuous revolution and active balance. Its core is the Party's unitary leadership, and its essence is to make department work mass-oriented, make mass movements a routine of department work, and integrate professional management and mass management. In this way, it fundamentally eliminates the root cause of running enterprises by relying only on a few people using administrative orders, so that a lively and revolutionary "guerrilla style" appears throughout the factory, which greatly promotes the development of production and lays the foundation for further establishing a scientific enterprise management system and management method that continuously adapts to the development of productive forces and is suitable for mass movement routines. As the employees say, "Three-level management is a dragon, each department is twisted into a rope, the whole factory is united, and the leap forward in production has no end."

    After this major reform, although the enterprise management of the Puzhen Rolling Stock Factory has greatly advanced again, according to the requirements of the continuously leaping forward situation, there are still many problems, such as the unbalanced development of the work of each department, the technological revolution of management tools is still in the beginning, and the mass management of some teams and groups is not sound enough, etc., which need to be further solved.

    在企业管理的各个方面建立群众运动的常规
    南京浦镇车辆工厂企业管理改革的调查报告
    中共南京市委工业部
    南京浦镇车辆工厂是一个中型的老厂，过去五十多年都以客货车修理为主；大跃进以来，已经发展到以造为主，修、造并举。全厂共有职工六千多人，十二个车间，十六个科室。按目前的生产能力计算，全厂可以年产货车一千八百辆，客车七百二十辆，钢五万四千吨，生铁轮六万个。1959年，这个厂的生产月月上升，全面超额地完成了国家计划，成为全国的红旗单位。今年以来，这个厂轰轰烈烈地掀起了技术革新和技术革命的高潮。第一季度全厂共建立生产流水线十五条，自动线五条，实现提高工效一至十倍的革新项目二千余项，和去年同期相比，总产值增长一点一八倍，钢增长七点九倍，货车增长十点二倍，生铁轮增长二十一倍，客车修理增长四点九倍，劳动生产率增长二点三六倍。由于成绩显著，因此月月获得铁道部厂际竞赛的流动红旗。
    技术革命和生产的发展要求不断改革企业管理工作
    技术革新和技术革命运动的浪潮，加速了生产力的发展，同时也要求工厂企业管理工作相应地不断变革。这个变革的基本要求，就是要在企业管理的各个方面建立群众运动的常规，使企业管理能够随着生产中一浪高一浪的群众运动，不断地提高，不断地完善，不断地促进生产力的发展。
    从1958年以来，浦镇车辆工厂曾经建立了一套基本适合于生产持续跃进的管理组织、管理方法和管理制度，特别在认真推行了“两参、一改、三结合”的经验之后，全厂有80％以上的小组始终坚持班、组管理，建立了群众管理的基础。特别是从大跃进以来，提拔了大批工人出身的领导干部、工程技术人员和科室工作人员，全厂工人出身的干部，在厂级干部中占83％，科长、车间主任、支部书记中占80％，工程技术干部中占53％。他们来自生产，熟悉生产，来自群众，熟悉群众，对党的事业忠心耿耿，勇于负责，敢于破旧立新。有了这样一个工人干部占绝对优势的专业管理机构，加上前面所说的80％以上的小组坚持班、组管理的群众基础，就为不断改善企业管理工作创造了极为优越的条件。
    技术革新和技术革命进入新阶段以后，对科室工作提出了一系列新的更高的要求：各车间成线成片地革新，科室工作就必须相应地加强组织性和计划性；消息要灵通，及时解决运动中出现的新问题；使科室工作上下左右拧成一股绳，不断组织新的平衡。同时，工具管理也必须革新，迅速提高工作效率。但是，在开始的时候，这个厂的不少科室干部对于这种新的形势认识不足，他们以消极平衡的观点对待不断变化着的事物。如钳工已经从单项革新迅速发展到成片大闹机械化了，技术部门还在设计一项一项的机具。他们花了很多时间设计出来的牛头刨床夹具和风动扳手，送到车间去时，工人们早已自己动手搞出了效率更高的机具。又如，货车底架的焊接，在短短一个月内就发生了三次变化：先是将手工焊改成了自动焊，后又改成无光电焊，不久又试制成功了更先进的躺焊，而材料科因为不能及时掌握运动发展的情况，忙于应付，使工作陷于被动局面。各科室在管理工作中的扯皮现象也很多。如对货车配件——轴箱的检验，由于部件车间和货车车间的试压标准不一，经常因为漏气而返工报废，影响生产很大，车间不断要求技术科解决这个问题，而技术科又把这个问题转给检查科，检查科说：“这不是我们份内的事”。货车车间的工人一连催了十几次，始终没有个头绪。
    科室工作跟不上技术革新和技术革命运动发展的矛盾越来越显得突出。车间里的群众运动搞得轰轰烈烈，科室里却是冷冷清清，车间一天数变，形势愈逼愈紧，科室人员的心情也愈来愈苦闷，他们迫切要求摆脱这种被动状态，改革科室的工作。
      科室、车间、小组展开三级“一条龙”竞赛，在
    群众运动中改革管理工作
    这个厂党委及时注意了这个情况。他们认识到，技术革新和技术革命运动不仅是一个生产运动，也是一个政治思想运动；企业的各个职能部门是党委领导生产的参谋部，是企业中承上启下、联贯左右的纽带，科室与车间、科室与科室之间的关系是企业中生产关系的一个重要方面。如果科室工作赶不上形势发展的需要，跟不上疾风暴雨般的群众运动的洪流，技术革命就会在科室这个环节上打起坝来，生产的持续跃进必然会受到阻碍。因此，厂党委一面号召科室人员全心全意地投入到火热的群众运动中间去，一面用车间大闹技术革新和技术革命的动人事例教育科室干部，以促进科室工作的大改革。
    在改革科室工作中，这个厂的中心工具室首先作出了显著的成绩。他们和车间、小组的管理人员一起，参加了全厂的技术革命运动会，针对工具管理上存在的主要问题，提出了比账物相符、比发放工具快、比处理问题及时、比工具清洁的“四比”竞赛，并且在技术革命运动会上作了现场表演。会后，他们又不断地组织科室、车间、小组之间开展三级一条龙竞赛，不断总结和推广先进经验，使工具室由冷冷清清一变而为热气腾腾，工作面貌焕然一新。过去中心工具室在刀具的供应上，是非常被动的，现在他们彻底改变了工作方法，结合技术革命运动会创造性地组织了“赛刀会”，集中工人们创造或改进的各种先进工具，当场表演，当场比赛，当场交流经验，当场组织推广。比赛过后又把最先进的刀具放在车间里进行展览。同时，他们还创造了一台切割机，可以随时切割各种形状的刀具；又设立了一个磨刀房，主动为工人磨刀，也很受群众欢迎。这样，中心工具室的工作就摆脱了被动的局面，站到了技术革新和技术革命运动的前列，成了积极的促进者。
    中心工具室用群众运动的方法改革管理工作的经验，为科室工作大搞群众运动树立了良好的榜样。厂党委立即抓住这个先进经验，在所有科室大力推广。全厂各个专业管理系统的三级一条龙竞赛很快就组织了起来，而且每个科室都有不同的竞赛内容和形式。如技术科通过技术革命运动会，先由车间把工人的先进的操作经验总结起来，经过科里鉴定编成了一百七十二本工艺文件。这项工作过去几年都没有搞起来，现在不到一个月就搞成了。生产计划科组织了“三勤”“四快”的一条龙竞赛，即勤分析、勤联系、勤督促检查，发现问题快、联系快、反映快、决定快。过去当天的生产进度要隔一天才能知道，现在已经做到两小时综合一次生产进度。过去被工人喻为“卡后门”的检查科，也改变了只抓尾不抓头、只管检查不问生产的作风，各级检查员同心协力，从第一道工序开始，就和工人一起分析产品质量，共同研究措施，大搞技术革新和技术革命。这样，不仅有效地提高了产品的质量，而且大大改善了检查员和工人之间的关系。通过三级一条龙竞赛，在全厂掀起了一个大闹企业管理改革的群众运动。科室人员纷纷走出了办公室，深入基层、深入生产、深入群众，服务运动、参加运动、促进运动。两个多月来，已从科室、车间、小组初步建立起一套适合于生产技术大发展的、比较灵活的、科学的、合理的管理制度，有力地推动了生产的持续大跃进。
    管理工作大搞群众运动、大搞竞赛的结果，不仅适应了技术革新和技术革命的要求，变被动为主动，更重要的是进一步调整了企业内部人与人的关系。例如，技术科的技术员王照宝，过去因为放不下架子，又怕人家瞧不起他，不敢下车间，有时下了车间，不是指手划脚，就是要这要那，工人看到他就不顺眼。这次在调整货车生产流水线的过程中，由于他转变了作风，吃在车间、睡在车间，帮助工人及时解决了若干生产技术上的关键问题，因此受到工人们的欢迎和爱戴。有一次，货车车间迫切需要搞躺焊，但缺乏人绘图，他就主动承担下来，苦战一昼夜就画出了图纸。工人们非常满意地说：“咱们就需要这样的技术员。”现在，王照宝每天都要下车间，一天不去就放心不下，工人们也是一天不见就想念他。王照宝转变作风的例子，也正是很多科室干部的写照。人们把科室和车间的关系作了一个今昔对比：过去是“卡住后门”，现在是“预防为主”；过去是“拖后腿”，现在是先行官；过去是各唱各的扯皮调，现在是合唱一支跃进曲；过去是吵吵闹闹“打官司”；现在是敲锣打鼓送喜报。
      科室干部不仅是行政工作者，也是政治工作者，
    不仅要做好技术管理工作，也要做好组织工作
    在科室、车间、小组之间展开三级一条龙竞赛的同时，在科室内部，以及科室与科室之间，也展开了热火朝天的竞赛运动。擂台比武、运动会、表演赛等等已经成为科室部门经常运用的工作方法。许多科室干部开始懂得了自己不仅是一个行政工作者，也应当是一个政治工作者，不仅要作好技术管理工作，也必须做好组织工作。以材料科为例，这个科过去只务实不务虚，工作方法是“消极平衡”、“照章办事”，工人们称之为“拖后腿”科。经过整风反右倾和大搞群众运动，现在的情况完全不同了，全科上下，里里外外，都建立了一套政治工作制度，各方面的工作都作得很出色。在原材料供应十分紧张的情况下，他们提出了“万水千山找料源，千方百计保高产”的口号。今年2月份，全厂计划新造货车一百三十辆，他们提出的供应指标是保证一百五十辆，争取一百九十辆；3月份全厂生产计划是一百五十辆，他们则保证供应二百辆的材料。为了不断地鼓足干劲，全科开展了科内业务组之间、厂外采购站之间和车间材料员之间的“三条龙”竞赛。对于分布在全国十五个省市的五十八名采购员，采取建立联合采购站，实行天天联系、月月评比等办法，加强了领导。在日常工作中，经常“抓两头”，进行深入细致的思想教育。例如，东北采购站的采购人员的干劲足，团结好，1、2两月份都提前十天完成任务，材料科就及时表扬，树立标兵。上海采购站的采购人员因为闹不团结，1月份采购任务没有完成，他们就抓住春节期间采购员回厂的时机，组织务虚，解决思想问题，结果上海采购站在2、3两月份就一跃而为优胜小组。最近，他们发现上海采购站的人员有些骄傲自满，又准备把他们调回来务虚。由于政治思想工作抓得紧，很多采购员在外出工作中都表现了高度的革命干劲，例如，到长白山采购木材的采购员，看到林场劳动力紧张，就主动参加劳动，日复一日，毫无怨言，使当地职工群众非常感动，并积极帮助他把大批木材从山里运了出来。由于材料科坚持了政治挂帅，建立了大搞群众运动的常规，因而在不增加人员的情况下，完成了几倍于1959年的材料采购任务。
    管理部门大搞群众运动，也大大促进了业务工作的技术革新，提高了工作效率。今年以来，据全厂十个科的统计，共计革新管理工具、简化报表一千六百多项。检查科实现的五百多项革新项目中，有二百多件是先进的检验工具，使检验效率提高了五倍左右。
    科室与科室展开共产主义的大协作，这是企业管理工作大搞群众运动的一个重要环节。浦镇车辆工厂有十个科室，各科室都在党委的统一领导下，以生产为中心，围绕全厂规划部署，互相挂钩，联合行动，作到了“各个科室拧成一股绳”。例如，在建立货车生产流水线的过程中，厂党委就将十个科室和货车、运输、基建、修配四个车间组织起来，通过协作会议，进行研究、部署，明确分工。会后技术科的工程师、技术员立即深入车间工地，同车间主任、技术员合作，广泛吸收职工群众意见，苦战十五天，制定了货车车间调整方案和作业进度表。设备科在进行机床改装时，发现二十二号厂房缺乏天车两辆，就主动利用旧的设备
  进行改造。材料科也将这个车间需要的材料主动地送上门去，并发动群众寻找废料，以满足生产流水线组成后生产能力大大增长的需要。生产流水线建成后，由于各科室事先已经作好了准备，一套新的管理制度也很快建立了起来。劳动工资科一天就算出了工时定额，财务会计科在一周之内算出了成本降低定额，人事科也及时地调整了劳动力，保证了这条生产流水线畅通无阻。
      大搞群众运动使企业管理工作有了广泛的群众基础，
    加强了战斗性、组织性和纪律性，使领导作风更加深入
    企业管理工作不断大搞群众运动的结果，不仅丰富了管理工作的经验，提高了管理工作的水平，充分发挥了专业部门的职能作用，而且使企业管理的组织也越来越严密，制度也越来越健全，工作也越做越细致。厂部和车间的管理部门，做到了既是党委管理企业的参谋部，又是党委大搞群众运动的参谋部。
    曾经有人担心用群众运动的方法来搞管理工作，会把生产“弄乱了”，“无章可循了”。但浦镇车辆工厂的实践充分证明：这样做不仅不会乱，相反地使专业管理更加生气勃勃，井井有条，从上到下更完整地建立起一套适应生产力飞速发展的、正常的革命秩序。其表现是：
    第一，管理工作有了更加广泛的群众基础。科室人员每天深入车间，活跃在生产第一线上，和车间、小组的管理人员一起工作，就使各科室的耳目十分灵通，几乎每时每刻都能向党委、厂长反映生产进度和新的问题，使管理工作能够适应瞬息万变的形势。例如，生产计划科过去要隔一天才能知道生产进度，而且只是几张干巴巴的报表，不能全面反映生产中的具体活动和新的问题。现在，他们按照钢、货车、新造客车、修理客车、生铁轮五大产品，派出一批调度员，整天在生产流水线上来往巡回，两小时报一次生产进度和问题，科内则挂图列表，及时将调度员反映的情况，用指示线表明，做到全厂生产一目了然。如遇有重大的、带有全厂性的问题，就及时向厂长汇报，由厂长召集有关部门研究解决。一般性的问题，则由生产计划科通知有关科室或车间来解决。
    第二，企业管理工作的战斗性加强了。党委的意图通过党支部和严密的管理组织，可以当天到达生产小组，小组的情况也可以及时反映上来，日常管理工作紧张而不忙乱。全厂从党委到科室、车间以至小组，建立了按日进行经济活动分析的制度。这样层层分析、上下循环的结果，使生产、技术革新和技术革命中需要及时解决的问题，当天就能落实到各个生产小组。同时，由于班、组管理的基础较强，上下结合得十分紧密，管理工作的主动性也就加强了。如客车车间漆工工区，由于4月初搞了不少技术革新，生产迅速发展，到4月17日，小组发现原来够用一个月的调合漆只有一周的储备了，便及时向车间的材料员反映，第二天由车间主任带到厂部对口合缝会议上提出。厂长决定一边由材料科立即通知各地采购，一边由技术科会同车间研究利用代用品。下午，材料科有关人员就下车间核实情况，当晚即向天津、上海等地采购员用电话发出通知；同时，技术科也于第二天着手和车间一道试验代用品。三天以后，有些采购站已洽购到一批货源，而车间代用品也已初步试验成功。这样，就避免了过去事到临头手忙脚乱甚至影响生产进度的现象。
    第三，管理工作的组织性和计划性也大大加强了。这个厂在每个月的下旬，采取“两上两下”的办法，编制和安排下个月的生产计划。首先由生产计划科根据总的规划和各个车间的意见提出初步的月度计划方案，提交党委。党委根据本厂的具体情况，对照全国车辆工厂的先进技术指标，初步确定生产指标和重大的技术革新项目，向各科室、车间作一个月的任务部署；各科室、车间随即以实现党委提出的各项指标和技术组织措施（包括重大技术革新项目）为中心，订出具体的行动计划，并结合月度决赛、评比，发动群众讨论计划、打擂比武；最后，由党委集中群众的意见，修改定案，再层层下达。在这一阶段中，各科室、车间之间还要签订保证生产进度和实现技术革新项目的联系合同，并将执行联系合同的规定，作为竞赛评比的首要条件。这一系列的活动，既把生产上的各个环节严密地组织了起来，又充分调动了群众的积极性。
    第四，由于管理工作渗透到群众运动之中，反映问题灵敏，使企业的规章制度能够及时的破，及时的立，使各项制度更加健全，更加适应生产力迅速发展的需要。修正规章制度也充分贯彻了群众路线的工作方法。如工具室过去曾经规定了一种领工具的“五牌”制，工人每天只能领五件工具。技术革命运动掀起高潮后，工人深感五件工具不够用，同时由于高级合金刀具较少，工人领了以后不愿意当天还，工具周转很慢。这次工人们建议将五牌制改为多牌制，每个人发一定数量的牌子，其中有主牌、副牌，主牌可以领到高级合金刀，副牌领一般刀具；主牌所借的工具，当天借，当天还。为了避免差错，工人们还建议他们将主、副牌上印上号码，刀具也印上号码，借、换刀具时“对号入座”。这样做了以后，刀具周转速度加快了，损耗比过去少了，工人也更加方便了。其他如材料科也进一步健全了领料卡制度，从小组到车间、科室层层有卡片，并且经常核对，不仅便于及时调度，保证需要，也大大节约了材料。
    第五，领导作风更加深入。这个厂在确定生产任务以后，党委即组织工作组，由党委书记或厂长率领，吸收有关的科室干部参加，深入薄弱环节，进行具体帮助。一般的情况是，工作组到那个单位去时，那里是薄弱环节，工作组离开的时候，这个单位已经成了先进的标兵。如客车车间今年1月份的任务完成得不好，党委书记就率领工作组下去，帮助车间干部明确分工，改进领导方法，同时发动群众搞出了几十项重大革新，当月就超额四辆完成客车修理任务，成本低、质量好，获得了全厂的流动红旗。
    人们用四个“高”来全面地概括了浦镇车辆工厂管理工作的新面貌，这就是：（一）高速度，高效率；（二）高度的组织性、纪律性和群众性；（三）高度的共产主义风格；（四）高度的独创精神。这“四高”标志着社会主义企业管理水平的质的飞跃，标志着社会主义企业内部人与人的关系又进入了一个新的阶段。
      以不断革命和积极平衡为主导思想，使科室工作群众
    运动化，使企业管理和群众管理融成一体
    浦镇车辆工厂不断加强和改进企业管理工作的过程，也是不断进行思想斗争的过程。要不要党的领导，要不要大搞群众运动，是斗争的焦点。从1958年“双反”运动以来，这个厂先后经历了四次较大的、集中的政治思想斗争。第一次是1958年4月间，全厂开展了“两参一改”的群众运动，彻底揭发和批判了“制度挂帅”的思想，像快刀斩乱麻似地破除了八百多项不合理的规章制度，在大破大立的同时，推行了班、组管理，建立了干部参加劳动的制度。第二次是在大炼钢铁时，狠狠地批判了“政治挂帅不能解决实际问题”、“大炼钢铁是劳民伤财、”“土洋并举是历史倒退”等错误论调。第三次是在1959年3月间，全厂开展了两个月的大辩论，彻底驳倒了“大跃进步子太大了”、“群众参加管理非乱不可”、“两参一改以后无章可循”等算账派的言论。以后又经过1959年第四季度与今年一季度“能不能继续大跃进”的大辩论，批判了“生产到顶，潜力挖完”、“不能老是搞运动”，而要求松一口气等右倾思想，取得了1959年“红到底”，今年“开门红”、“月月红”的巨大胜利。通过这几次大规模的思想斗争，又加上技术革新和技术革命运动的促进，浦镇车辆工厂已经在企业管理的各个方面，建立了在党的绝对领导下大搞群众运动的常规，“两参一改三结合”的制度也因此有了更加丰富的内容：
      （1）很多干部特别是车间一级的干部，不仅是定期参加体力劳动，实际上已经以车间为家，吃在车间、睡在车间、干在车间，习以为常。领导骨干参加体力劳动已经和“抓两头”密切结合起来，生产中那一个环节最薄弱，那里就出现由领导骨干组成的工作组，他们一面参加劳动，一面解决生产中的关键问题，收到了显著的效果。
      （2）在工人参加管理方面，已经具有更加广泛的群众性。很多生产小组，都形成了以党员、小组长和一部分老工人为核心，以技术员、计划调度员、定额核算员、宣传员、检查员、材料员、安全卫生员、工具保管员为主干，组织每一个工人参加到管理工作中来。经过两年来的实践，特别是通过三级一条龙的竞赛，不断地总结和推广班、组管理的经验，工人参加管理的水平已经大大提高。
      （3）在改革规章制度方面，由于三级管理人员天天会师车间，全厂上下脉脉相通，职工群众的任何合理化建议，都可以迅速反映上来，得到及时的解决。同时改革规章制度的工作已经和三级管理部门的竞赛密切结合起来，落后的规章制度不断被破除，促进生产的规章制度不断建立，这种现象已成常规。
      （4）领导干部与工人、工程技术人员的“三结合”，不仅出现在突破生产关键、试制新产品和实现重大革新项目方面，而且已经贯穿到生产的日常活动中去。过去不少工程技术人员都是在“三结合”的时候才和工人群众“通气”，现在一般工程技术人员每天至少有一半时间在车间，大家朝夕相处，遇事商量，做到了“自然通风”。
    浦镇车辆工厂这一套企业管理制度和管理方法，是在大闹群众运动的基础上产生的，是以不断革命和积极平衡为主导思想的，其核心是党的一元化领导，其实质就是使科室工作群众运动化，使群众运动成为科室工作的常规，使专业管理和群众管理融成一体。这样就从根本上扫除了那种只依靠少数人用行政命令办企业的根子，使全厂上下出现了一种活泼的革命的“游击作风”，大大促进了生产的发展，并且为进一步建立一套不断适合生产力发展的适合群众运动常规的、科学的企业管理制度与管理方法创立了基础。正如职工群众所说的“三级管理一条龙，各个
  科室拧成一股绳，全厂上下一条心，生产跃进无止境”。
    经过这一场大改革，浦镇车辆工厂的企业管理虽然又大大前进一步，
  但根据不断跃进形势的要求，还存在不少问题，如各科室工作的发展还不平衡，管理工具的技术革命还在开始，有些班、组的群众管理还不够健全等等，这些都有待于进一步加以解决。
