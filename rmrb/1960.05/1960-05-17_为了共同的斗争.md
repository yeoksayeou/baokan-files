For Our Common Struggle
Poem by Gao Shiqi

Poets, arise!
Use your voices of justice,
To strike the aggressors;
Don't allow them,
To disturb Cuba's sugarcane fields again.
To defend the Cuban revolution,
Is to defend national dignity.

Poets, unite!
Use poetry's long sword,
To drive away the American robbers;
Don't permit them,
To enter or leave Havana's port again.
To defend the Cuban revolution,
Is to defend world peace.

Wherever the enemy goes,
Annihilate him there.
Cuban brothers and sisters,
The Chinese people support you;
All peace-loving people,
Stand together with you.
For our common struggle,
Down with American imperialism!

    为了共同的斗争
    高士其诗人们，起来！用正义的呼声，打击侵略者；不准他们，再骚扰古巴的甘蔗田。保卫古巴革命，就是保卫民族尊严。诗人们，团结起来！用诗的长剑，赶走美国强盗；不许他们，再进出哈瓦那的港口。保卫古巴革命，就是保卫世界和平。敌人到那里，就把他消灭在那里。古巴的兄弟姐妹，中国人民支持你；一切爱好和平的人民，都和你们站在一起。为了我们共同的斗争，打倒美帝国主义！
