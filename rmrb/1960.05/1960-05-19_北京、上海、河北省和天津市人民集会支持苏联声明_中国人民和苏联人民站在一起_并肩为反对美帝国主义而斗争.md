Xinhua News Agency, 18th: Workers, peasants, teachers, students, and people from all walks of life in Beijing today expressed their firm support for the statement made by Chairman Khrushchev of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union at the preliminary meeting of the Four Power Summit, and strongly condemned the U.S. imperialists' plot to plan a new war.

Wang Cai, furnace chief of the No. 2 blast furnace at the Iron Smelting Plant of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, said, "We Chinese people have long seen through Eisenhower as not being a 'messenger of peace' but the biggest and most ferocious enemy in the world. We resolutely oppose the American robbers' provocation against the Soviet Union. To invade the Soviet Union is to invade China and the entire socialist camp. We Chinese workers are determined to unite closely with the Soviet people, thoroughly smash all provocative acts of U.S. imperialism, and fight to the end to defend peace."

Luo Wenxia, an advanced producer in Beijing and a female worker at the Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, said, "We resolutely support Comrade Khrushchev's statement at the preliminary meeting of the Four Power Summit. Chinese workers fully recognize that U.S. imperialism is the root cause of war. We love peace, but we understand that only by waging a resolute struggle against the imperialist war-mongers can we safeguard world peace."

Zhou Guanwu, director of the Shijingshan Sino-Soviet Friendship People's Commune, said, "President Eisenhower's robber act of sending spy planes to invade Soviet airspace has once again exposed the true face of U.S. imperialism preparing for a war of aggression under the smoke screen of peace, and once again proves that Eisenhower is the number one war-monger in the world. We must be highly vigilant against and thoroughly expose the aggressive nature and war conspiracy of U.S. imperialism."

Zhang Hongzeng, Associate Professor of the International Law Teaching and Research Section of the Institute of International Relations, said, "U.S. President Eisenhower's dispatch of U-2 spy planes to invade the Soviet Union, and his public declaration that this provocative act of aggression will be continued as a U.S. policy, is an unprecedented and blatant trampling on universally recognized norms of international law and the United Nations Charter. Respect for national sovereignty and territorial inviolability are recognized basic norms of modern international law. The various sophistries made by imperialism for its crimes of infringing upon Soviet sovereignty can never escape the responsibility it should bear."

All the students of Class 12, Grade 4, Department of Journalism, Renmin University of China, in a letter to the newspaper, expressed their firm support for Comrade Khrushchev's solemn statement and warned U.S. imperialism that if it continues to pursue a policy of war and aggression and antagonize the people of the world, the consequences will inevitably be self-immolation.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 18th: People from all walks of life in Shanghai have expressed their firm support for the solemn statement made by Chairman Khrushchev of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union at the preliminary meeting of the Four Power Summit, and expressed their utmost indignation at Eisenhower's shameless insistence on an aggressive policy and the robber acts of sabotaging the Four Power Summit. The Lu Shengzhi group of the No. 2 Open Hearth Furnace of the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant also passed a resolution, resolutely condemning the provocative incident of U.S. imperialism's planes invading Soviet airspace. They believe that on the eve of the Four Power Summit, the United States sent planes to the Soviet Union for espionage activities, intentionally disrupting the Four Power Summit, and the United States is entirely responsible for the failure of the meeting. Huang Nengxing, a nationally advanced producer and a famous steelmaking expert at the Shanghai No. 5 Steel Plant, said, "We Shanghai steelworkers stand firmly with the Soviet people and oppose the war conspiracy of the American war-mongers." He also said that producing one more ton of steel means adding one more point of strength to the peace camp.

When the Soviet government's statement reached Fudan University and Jiaotong University, the students applauded and unanimously supported the Soviet government's solemn position. In the past two days, many classes have held rallies. Chen Tinglai, chairman of the Student Union of Jiaotong University, said at the meeting: "This statement is a powerful blow to U.S. imperialism, and all the students of Jiaotong University resolutely support the just position of the Soviet government." He said that the U-2 aircraft incident once again proved that Eisenhower is by no means a "messenger of peace," but a thorough war-monger, and it is meaningless to negotiate with such a war-monger.

Zhou Laijin, a 67-year-old retired worker and resident of the Yongding New Village Neighborhood Committee in Putuo District, said, "U.S. imperialism talks about peace but actually engages in aggression. The Soviet government's statement has torn off Eisenhower's mask."

Today, Shanghai newspaper offices received tens of thousands of letters from readers, firmly supporting the Soviet government's statement.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 18th: People from all walks of life in Hebei Province and Tianjin City gathered tonight to severely condemn U.S. imperialism for adhering to its aggressive policy and deliberately sabotaging the conspiracy of the Four Power Summit.

Zhang Guofan, vice chairman of the Tianjin Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, said at the meeting that U.S. imperialism is engaging in false peace and real war preparation. Only by thoroughly exposing the aggressive face of U.S. imperialism and carrying out a resolute struggle can we safeguard world peace. Yang Shixian, chairman of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, said that U.S. imperialism has never given up its conspiracy to plan a new war. It has no sincerity at all in maintaining world peace. It was forced to participate in peace negotiations, but deliberately sabotaged peace negotiations.

Zhou Yunfang, vice chairman of the Hebei Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, and Zhang Yu, secretary of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, spoke at the meeting, unanimously pointing out that Eisenhower's shameless sophistry in the face of the Soviet Union's just condemnation once again exposed Eisenhower's false mask of "messenger of peace" and the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism. The working class of Hebei Province, together with the people of the whole country, resolutely and together with the Soviet working brothers and the Soviet people, will fight to the end against U.S. imperialism and to defend world peace.

    北京、上海、河北省和天津市人民集会支持苏联声明 
    中国人民和苏联人民站在一起
    并肩为反对美帝国主义而斗争
    据新华社18日讯　北京市工人、农民、教师、学生等各界人民，今天纷纷表示坚决支持苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在四国首脑会议预备会议上发表的声明，并且严厉谴责美帝国主义策划新战争的阴谋。
    石景山钢铁公司炼铁厂第二高炉炉长王才说，我们中国人民，早就看破了艾森豪威尔不是什么“和平的使者”，而是世界最大最凶恶的敌人。我们坚决反对美国强盗对苏联的挑衅。侵犯苏联，就是侵犯中国和整个社会主义阵营。我们中国工人坚决和苏联人民紧密团结在一起，彻底粉碎美帝国主义的一切挑衅行为，为保卫和平而斗争到底。
    北京市先进生产者、北京第二棉纺织厂女工骆文霞说，我们坚决支持赫鲁晓夫同志在四国首脑会议预备会议上发表的声明。中国工人完全认识到美帝国主义是战争的祸根。我们热爱和平，但我们懂得只有同帝国主义战争贩子进行坚决的斗争，才能保卫住世界和平。
    石景山中苏友好人民公社主任周冠五说，美国总统艾森豪威尔派遣间谍飞机侵犯苏联领空的强盗行为，再一次暴露了美帝国主义在和平的烟幕下准备侵略战争的真面目，再一次证明了艾森豪威尔是全世界第一号战争贩子。对美帝国主义的侵略本质和战争阴谋，我们一定要提高警惕，并彻底予以揭露。
    国际关系学院国际法教研室副教授张鸿增说，美国总统艾森豪威尔派遣U—2式间谍飞机侵犯苏联，并且公然将这种挑衅侵略行为宣布为美国今后继续执行的政策，这是史无前例的粗暴地践踏公认国际法准则和联合国宪章的强盗犯罪行为。尊重国家主权和领土不可侵犯性，是现代国际法公认的基本准则。帝国主义为侵犯苏联主权的罪行所作的各种诡辩，决不可能逃避它应该承担的责任。
    中国人民大学新闻系四年级十二班全体学生在写给报社的一封信中，表示坚决支持赫鲁晓夫同志的严正声明，并且警告美帝国主义：它继续奉行战争和侵略政策与全世界人民为敌，其后果必将玩火自焚。
    据新华社上海18日电　上海各界人民纷纷表示坚决支持苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在四国首脑会议预备会议上发表的严正声明，并且对艾森豪威尔无耻坚持侵略政策、破坏四国首脑会议的强盗行径表示无比的愤慨。上钢三厂二号平炉陆盛芝小组并通过决议，坚决谴责美国帝国主义的飞机侵入苏联领空的挑衅事件。他们认为，在四国首脑会议召开前夕，美国派飞机到苏联进行间谍活动，是有意破坏四国首脑会议，会议开不成功，完全要由美国负责。全国先进生产者、上钢五厂的著名炼钢能手黄能兴说，我们上海钢铁工人坚决和苏联人民站在一起，反对美国战争贩子的战争阴谋。他还表示，多生产一吨钢，就是为和平阵营多增添一分力量。
    当苏联政府的声明传到复旦大学、交通大学的时候，学生们看了个个拍手赞成，一致支持苏联政府的严正立场。两天来，许多班级都举行了集会，交通大学学生会主席陈廷莱在会上说：这个声明是对美帝国主义的一个有力的打击，我们交通大学的全体同学坚决支持苏联政府的正义立场。他说，U—2型飞机事件再一次证明了艾森豪威尔决不是什么“和平使者”，而是一个彻头彻尾的战争贩子，和这样的战争贩子进行谈判是毫无意义的。
    普陀区永定新村里弄委员会居民六十七岁老年退休工人周来金说，美帝国主义嘴上讲和平，实际搞侵略，苏联政府的声明把艾森豪威尔的假面具撕下了。
    今天，上海各报社收到了数以万计的读者来信，坚决支持苏联政府的声明。
    据新华社天津18日电　河北省和天津市各界人士今晚集会，严厉谴责美帝国主义坚持侵略政策，蓄意破坏四国首脑会议的阴谋。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会天津市分会副主席张国藩在会上说，美帝国主义是假和平、真备战，只有彻底揭露美帝国主义的侵略面目，并进行坚决斗争，才能保卫世界和平。中国民主促进会天津市委员会主任委员杨石先说，美帝国主义从来就没有放弃策划新战争的阴谋，它根本没有维护世界和平的诚意，它是被迫参加和平谈判的，而又蓄意破坏和平谈判。
    河北省总工会副主席周云芳、共青团河北省委员会书记张玉在会上发言，一致指出，艾森豪威尔对苏联的正义谴责进行无耻狡辩，再一次暴露了艾森豪威尔“和平使者”的假面目和美帝国主义的侵略本质。河北省工人阶级和全国人民一道，坚决地和苏联工人弟兄、苏联人民一起为反对美帝国主义、为保卫世界和平斗争到底。
