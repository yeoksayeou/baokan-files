Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 26th - The Wuxi Diesel Engine Factory has recently successfully trial-produced air-cooled diesel engines and water-cooled diesel engines. These two types of diesel engines are "all-rounders" in power machinery. They can adapt to various natural environments such as plains, mountains, and deserts; they are also power machinery used in many aspects such as water lifting, rice milling, transportation, and drilling. The power of these two types of diesel engines is 50% to 100% higher than that of old products; however, the parts are fewer than old products, and the weight is also lighter.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 27th - Workers at the Fuzhou Automobile Repair and Assembly Plant of the Fujian Provincial Transportation Bureau have recently successfully assembled a railway-highway dual-purpose truck.

When this vehicle transfers from the highway to a light rail track, a lifting device installed on the vehicle quickly lowers the wheels that run on the railway, and the truck travels along the track at a speed of twenty to thirty kilometers per hour; if it switches from the railway to the highway, the railway wheels are suspended, and the automobile wheels are used to travel on the highway. It can carry four tons each time; when traveling on the railway, it can also increase the towing capacity.

    无锡柴油机厂制成两种新型柴油机
    福州制成铁路公路两用载重车
    据新华社南京26日电　无锡柴油机厂最近试制成功风冷柴油机和水冷柴油机。这两种柴油机是动力机械中的“多面手”。它能适应平原、山区、沙漠等各种自然环境；又是戽水、碾米、运输、钻探等多方面用的动力机械。这两种柴油机的功率比老产品提高50％到一倍；零件却比老产品少，重量也轻。
    新华社福州27日电　福建省运输局福州汽车修配厂职工，最近装配成功一种铁路、公路两用载重车。
    当这辆车从公路转入轻便轨道的时候，有一种安装在车上的升降设备，很快把在铁路行驶的车轮放下，载重车就沿着轨道，以每小时二十到三十公里的速度行驶；如从铁路转向公路时，就把铁路车轮悬挂起来，用汽车轮在公路上行驶。它每次能载重四吨；行驶在铁路上，还可以增加拖带。
