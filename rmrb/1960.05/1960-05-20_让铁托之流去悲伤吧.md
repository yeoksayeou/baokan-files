    Let the likes of Tito grieve
    Ji Ming
    After the U.S. spy plane incident of invading Soviet airspace, the newspapers of the Yugoslav modern revisionists came out to defend the American aggression and openly expressed dissatisfaction with the world opinion's condemnation of the United States; but Tito remained silent. However, now that the United States is in an even more embarrassing situation, Tito has finally come out to speak personally.
    Under the tremendous pressure of world opinion, Tito, in order to conceal his true face, had to "criticize" the U.S. plane's invasion of the Soviet Union as a "negative event" in his speech on May 17. However, he immediately downplayed the incident as a trivial matter, saying that the importance of what happened between the United States and the Soviet Union "lies not in their facts but in their impact." He also said: "Is this the main fact now? Should it become an excuse for a dispute of such magnitude? Of course, it doesn't need to and shouldn't be like that." Tito also believed that whoever does this is "restoring the Cold War" and "does not conform to mankind's deep desire for peace."
    Look, how much Tito wants to dress himself up as an impartial and peace-loving person. But despite Tito's good intentions, he still revealed the appearance of an American lackey. Tito said that the U.S. plane's invasion of the Soviet Union does not seem to be a big deal, nor is it the "main fact" of the current situation. What does this mean? Is it a trivial matter that a country's sovereignty is violated and a country's security is threatened? Is it a secondary fact that the head of the imperialist camp, the United States, provokes the Soviet Union in the socialist camp, and openly expresses its intention to adhere to this aggressive policy? Of course, in the eyes of Tito, a traitor to the socialist cause, since one's soul can be sold to imperialism, what does a country's sovereignty and security matter? But, after all, this kind of lackey philosophy is despised by the people all over the world. Tito's characterization of the serious American aggression as unimportant can only prove that he is trying his best to divert people's attention and trying to cover up American imperialism with a smokescreen.
    Tito's speech was not only to cover up the crime of the United States in invading Soviet airspace, but also to slander the Soviet Union and shift the responsibility for the United States' sabotage of the Four-Power Summit Conference onto the Soviet Union. Tito's main argument is: since the incident of the U.S. plane's invasion of the Soviet Union is only a trivial matter, then what is the need for the Soviet Union to use it as an "excuse" for a large-scale dispute? In Tito's view, the United States has the right to invade Soviet airspace, the right to steal Soviet military intelligence, the right to provoke the Soviet Union, and the right to say that this is the United States' "responsibility," saying that the United States can never abandon this "responsibility," while the Soviet Union has no right to condemn the American aggression, no right to demand that the United States admit its mistakes, and no right to explain the truth to the world... otherwise it is "restoring the Cold War." In short, it is not allowed to expose the robber after he is discovered, and it is not allowed to speak out after being invaded. If anyone exposes it or speaks out, then the fault lies not with the robber and the invader, but with those who "dispute"! Is there such an impartial and peace-loving person in the world—he does not oppose those who violate peace, but specializes in opposing those who oppose the violation of peace! No matter what name such impartial and peace-loving people give themselves, no matter what kind of signboard they hang on their chests, they can only be accomplices, lackeys, or apologists for the invaders. These people are not against disputes, they are just arguing for the invaders.
    However, no matter whether it is Tito or anyone else, it is now futile to try to excuse the United States' crime of invading the Soviet Union or to shirk the United States' responsibility for sabotaging the Four-Power Summit Conference. Eisenhower has admitted that sending spy planes to invade other countries' airspace is the policy of the United States; he has also brazenly rejected the Soviet Union's legitimate demand that the United States admit its mistakes and severely punish the spy criminals, thereby making the Four-Power Summit Conference impossible. These two things most clearly demonstrate the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism and educate the people of the world. Therefore, this is a good thing. Tito and other accomplices, lackeys, or apologists of imperialism are now coming out to talk a lot, which also most clearly shows their faces. This is also a good thing. Tito said that the current situation "makes people very sad"; indeed, for the likes of Tito, this mood is completely in line with the rules. However, for the people of the world who truly want peace, the current situation is a very good situation in which the east wind prevails over the west wind. Let Tito, the traitor of Marxism-Leninism, and his masters grieve, and the people of the world will become more vigilant, more confident, and more united to fight against imperialist aggression and strive for lasting peace.

    让铁托之流去悲伤吧
    纪明
    美国间谍飞机侵犯苏联领空的事件发生以后，南斯拉夫现代修正主义者的报纸纷纷出来替美国的侵略行为辩护，并公然对世界舆论谴责美国表示不满；但铁托还保持着沉默。可是，现在当美国更加陷于极端狼狈的境地时，铁托却终于亲自出来讲话了。
    在世界舆论的巨大压力下，铁托为了掩饰自己的真实面目，不得不在5月17日的讲话中轻描淡写地
  “批评”美机侵犯苏联是一个“消极事件”。但是，他紧接着就把这个事件说成是一件小事，说什么美苏之间发生的事情的重要性“不在于它们的事实而在于它们的影响”。他并且说：“这难道是现在的主要事实吗？它难道应成为具有这样规模的争执的借口吗？当然它不需要也不应该这样。”铁托还认为，谁要是这样做，谁就是“使冷战恢复”，“不符合人类争取和平的深切愿望”。
    请看，铁托是多么想把自己打扮成为主持公道者和和平爱好者啊。但是，尽管铁托用心良苦，他还是露出了美国奴才的相貌。铁托说美机侵犯苏联似乎不算什么了不得的事，也不是当前局势的“主要事实”，这是什么意思呢？难道一个国家的主权受到了侵犯，一个国家的安全受到了威胁，这是小事吗？难道帝国主义阵营的头子美国向社会主义阵营的苏联挑衅，而且公然表示要坚持这种侵略政策，这是什么次要事实吗？当然，在社会主义事业的叛徒铁托看来，既然一个人的灵魂都可以出卖给帝国主义，一个国家的主权和安全又算得什么呢？但，这种奴才的哲学，毕竟是全世界人民所不齿的。铁托把美国的严重侵略罪行说成是不重要的，只能证明他是在极力转移人们的视线，想用遮眼法来掩护美帝国主义而已。
    铁托的讲话，还不仅为了掩饰美国侵犯苏联领空的罪行，而且是为了中伤苏联，把美国破坏四国首脑会议的责任推到苏联身上。铁托的主要论点是：既然美机侵犯苏联的事件不过是小事一端，那么苏联有什么必要把它作为大“规模争执的借口”呢？在铁托看来，美国有权侵犯苏联领空，有权偷窃苏联军事情报，有权向苏联挑衅，并且有权表示这是美国的“责任”，说美国绝不能放弃这种“责任”，而苏联却无权谴责美国的侵略，无权要求美国承认错误，无权向全世界说明事实真相……后则就是“恢复冷战”。总之，发现强盗不许人家声张，受到侵犯不许人家说话，如果谁声张了，谁讲话了，那么过错就不在于强盗和侵犯者，而在于那些“争执”的人！世界上难道有这样的主持公道者和和平爱好者吗——他不反对侵犯和平的人，却专门反对反对侵犯和平的人！这样的主持公道者和和平爱好者不管给自己起什么样的名字，不管在胸前挂上什么样的招牌，他们都只能是侵略者的帮凶、走狗或辩护师。这些人并不是反对争执，他们不过是替侵略者争执而已。
    但是，不管铁托也好，或者任何其他人也好，现在要想替美国开脱侵犯苏联的罪行，或者替美国推卸破坏四国首脑会议的责任，都是白费的。艾森豪威尔已经承认派间谍飞机侵犯他国领空，是美国的政策；他又悍然拒绝苏联提出的关于美国承认它的错误和严惩间谍罪犯的正当要求，从而使四国首脑会议无法举行。这两件事最清楚地表现了美帝国主义的侵略本性，教育了全世界人民。因此，这是好事情。铁托和帝国主义的其他帮凶、走狗或辩护师现在出来大讲特讲，也最清楚地显出了他们的面目。这也是好事情。铁托说，目前形势“使人非常悲伤”；的确，对于铁托之流来讲，这种心情完全是合乎规律的。但是，对于全世界真正要求和平的人们来说，目前正是一片东风压倒西风的大好形势。让马克思列宁主义的叛徒铁托和他的主人去悲伤吧，全世界人民将更加提高警惕，更加充满信心，更加团结起来，为反对帝国主义侵略和争取持久和平而斗争。
