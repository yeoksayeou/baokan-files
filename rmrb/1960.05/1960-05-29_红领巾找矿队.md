    The Young Pioneers' Prospecting Team

    May 8th was a day of heavy skies and stifling heat. Yet, the young members of the "Young Pioneers' Prospecting Team" of Shuangdongzi Elementary School in Pingquan Township were still battling away in the deep mountains and valleys...

    "Teacher Wang...found...it!" Xiu Zhi and Wang Zhong made a megaphone with their hands, shouting loudly from halfway up the mountain.

    Wang Zhong smashed off a piece of fluorite with a small hammer and handed it to Teacher Wang, saying like a small cannon, "Teacher Wang, I said I could find it, and I did! What do you think!"

    During the mass prospecting movement in Pingquan County, the Young Pioneers of Shuangdongzi Elementary School in Pingquan Township organized a "Young Pioneers' Prospecting Team." As this is a mountainous area, the students are scattered in various mountain gullies. They use their time going to and from school, extracurricular activities, and playtime to go up the mountains to find minerals. They also combine this with part-work and part-study to dig up medicinal herbs, and combine it with the current central task of planting trees and combating drought by sowing seeds and going into the mountains to find minerals. In April, they found more than 260 pieces of ore as a gift to the "May Day" International Labor Day. According to incomplete statistics, from the beginning of April to now, they have found a total of 545 pieces of manganese ore, magnetite, hematite, barite, fluorite, potassium feldspar, phosphorus, calcite, granite, obsidian, diorite, and other minerals, including over 40 kinds of minerals and rocks.

    红领巾找矿队
    5月8日，天空浮着黑云，怪闷热的。可是，平泉镇双洞子小学“红领巾找矿队”小队员们还奋战在深山峡谷里……。
    “王老师……找…到……了！”秀芝、王忠用手比作广播筒，站在半山腰上大声地喊着。
    王忠用小锤砸下来一块莹石递给王老师，像小钢炮一样地说：“王老师，我说能找到准能找到，你看怎么样！”
    在平泉县全民找矿运动中，平泉镇公社双洞子小学的少先队员组织了一个“红领巾找矿队”。这里是山区，学生们分居在各个山沟，他们就利用上学下学、课外活动和游戏时间上山找矿，还结合勤工俭学刨药材，结合当前中心工作植树造林、抗旱播种进山找矿。在4月份，他们找到矿石二百六十多块，向“五一”国际劳动节献礼。据不完全统计，4月初到现在他们共找到锰矿、磁铁矿、赤铁矿、重晶石、莹石、钾长石、磷、方解石、花岗岩、黑耀岩、闪长岩等共五百四十五块，四十多种矿物、岩石。　　　　河北省平泉县　李钟群
