Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 19th: On the evening of the 18th, 1,500 representatives from all walks of life in Moscow held a meeting at the Tchaikovsky Concert Hall to strongly condemn the U.S. imperialist aerial bandit act of violating Soviet airspace.

The meeting was convened by the Soviet Peace Committee.

Nikolai Tikhonov, Chairman of the Soviet Peace Committee, spoke first at the meeting, saying: The mask of peace of the U.S. ruling clique, headed by Eisenhower, has been torn off, and the true face of the aggressor has been exposed. He pointed out that the U.S. ruling clique went to Paris with sinister intentions. Khrushchev's statement exposed the deceptive tricks of the U.S. ruling clique to deceive the people of all countries to the world. This statement has been unanimously supported by the Soviet and world people.

Tikhonov also said, "We appeal to the people of Pakistan, Turkey, and other countries where bases are used by the U.S. Air Force, calling on them to rise up to defend the independence of their countries."

Nikolayeva, Secretary of the Central Council of Trade Unions of the Soviet Union, spoke next. She represented 57 million members of the Soviet trade unions in angrily condemning the provocative actions of U.S. imperialism.

All the Soviet people warmly support Khrushchev's solemn statement.

Moscow construction worker Romanov warned the aggressors not to play with fire in his speech.

Soviet hero Sorokin, who shot down 18 fascist planes in the war against Germany, severely warned the U.S. ruling clique at the meeting, saying: Soviet rockets can hit any target on the globe. He said that if the imperialists dare to launch a war, Soviet pilots will once again fly into the sky and annihilate them.

Soviet People's Artist Tsarev called on cultural and artistic workers of all countries to strengthen the struggle against the enemies of peace in his speech.

The meeting finally adopted a resolution condemning the U.S. reactionary clique for taking aggressive actions against the Soviet Union and unanimously supporting Khrushchev's statement in Paris.

This newspaper's comprehensive report: According to Xinhua News Agency, people from all walks of life in Guangdong Province, Guangzhou City, Chongqing City, Shaanxi Province, and Xi'an City have held meetings, forums, and issued statements, resolutely supporting the Soviet government's statement and denouncing the U.S. imperialist gangsterism in adhering to its policy of aggression and sabotaging the Four-Power Summit.

Chen Nengxing, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, said in a statement: The U.S. imperialists' sending planes to invade the Soviet Union for military reconnaissance and sabotaging the Four-Power Summit proves that U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious and aggressive imperialism of our time. He said: The U.S. reactionary ruling clique's frenzied arms expansion and war preparations are seriously threatening world peace. If the people of the world want to defend world peace and defeat the imperialists' war conspiracy, they must unite and persist in the struggle.

Huang Youmou, Deputy Director of the Guangzhou Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said: We love peace, but the pursuit of peace must be achieved through struggle, that is, by constantly exposing and smashing the war conspiracies of imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism. Guo Dihuo, Director of the Guangdong Provincial Working Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, said: This crude act of aggression and war provocation by U.S. imperialism powerfully exposes Eisenhower as a ferocious warmonger, not a "peace envoy."

Many factories and mining enterprises in Chongqing held forums. Chen Wenmin, a worker-turned-Deputy Chief Mechanical Engineer of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, said at the meeting: The U.S. imperialists' dispatch of planes to invade Soviet airspace fully exposed their ugly face of fake peace and real war preparations. The peace-loving people of the world will never allow U.S. imperialism to run rampant. If they insist on provoking war, they will surely reap what they sow. Liu Mouzhu, a representative of the National Heroes' Conference and an engineer at the Large Rolling Mill of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, said: Now the facts are very clear, the American bandits simply do not want peace. We resolutely stand with the Soviet people and the peace-loving people of the world to smash all the conspiracies of U.S. imperialism and fight to the end to defend world peace.

More than 180 reading groups in the Sino-Soviet Friendship People's Commune in the suburbs of Chongqing held discussions, and the members unanimously expressed their full support for Comrade Khrushchev's statement. Xu Cuijuan, Deputy Director of the Qixinggang People's Commune, said, "We fully support Comrade Khrushchev's statement. The people of China and the Soviet Union are united, the strength of the socialist camp is strong, and if U.S. imperialism dares to launch a war, it will surely be sanctioned by the people of the world."

The Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Shaanxi Provincial People's Political Consultative Conference held a meeting on the afternoon of the 19th. Han Wangchen, Chairman of the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, said at the meeting that Eisenhower's dispatch of planes to invade Soviet airspace for criminal reconnaissance activities and sabotage of the Four-Power Summit once again proved that there should be no illusions about imperialism, and only by adhering to the struggle can world peace be defended. Li Xiangsheng, Chairman of the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, said that not long ago, U.S. imperialism colluded with the Japanese reactionaries to sign the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, making Japan its war base in Asia; recently, U.S. imperialism openly sent military aircraft to invade the Soviet Union, sabotaging the Four-Power Summit. These events have repeatedly torn off the mask of "peace envoy" of U.S. imperialism. Zhou Youming, Secretary-General of the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, said that Khrushchev's statement is entirely a voice of justice. This statement hit the sore spot of U.S. imperialism, tore off Eisenhower's disguise, and exposed the hideous face of the warmonger to the world.

According to Xinhua News Agency, the broad masses of working people in Czechoslovakia held rallies on the 17th. The workers of the Prague Automobile Repair Factory wrote in a unanimously adopted resolution: "We fully agree with Khrushchev's point of view. We recall again that the reason we lost our national independence before the Second World War was the result of the methods adopted by imperialism." Ulkes, a miner from Ostrava, said: "Khrushchev did the right thing. I, along with the working people of the world, welcome the firm and uncompromising position of the head of the Soviet government." The secretary of the People's Committee of Nesyha Township in the Ustí Region said: "I fully agree with Comrade Khrushchev's warning to the U.S. government." Many rallies supporting Khrushchev's statement were also held in various army units. Trevni, the commander of a certain unit, said at a rally that the U.S. representatives announced that they would continue to violate airspace, which is tantamount to openly saying that they do not want peace.

According to Xinhua News Agency, since May 17, the working people all over Bulgaria have been holding rallies, firmly supporting the Soviet government's statement. At mass rallies, employees of many factories, enterprises, and institutions also unanimously passed telegrams to the Soviet government or the Soviet Embassy in Bulgaria, expressing their support for Khrushchev's statement and angrily condemning the U.S. imperialists' rogue behavior in undermining the government summit. The employees of the "Dimitrov" shipbuilding and repair factory in Varna sent a telegram to the Soviet Embassy saying that the employees of our factory are angry and protest against the U.S. imperialists who are trying to undermine the government summit.

According to Xinhua News Agency, many industrial enterprises, construction sites, government offices, and schools in Mongolia held mass rallies on the 17th. Shoemaker Badamgarav said at the staff meeting of the industrial cooperative that since U.S. President Eisenhower not only did not condemn the U.S. militarists' bandit behavior, but also said that the United States would continue such flights in the future, how can there be an effective summit and resolve pressing international issues? At the staff meeting of the Ulaanbaatar Film Studio, the speakers unanimously pointed out that the unsuccessful outcome of the Paris Conference was a direct result of the provocative policies of the U.S. ruling clique and the military, who shamelessly declared that they would continue to take aggressive actions against the socialist camp in the future.

    广东省总工会主席陈能兴发表谈话说：美帝国主义派遣飞机侵犯苏联进行军事侦察，破坏四国首脑会议的行为，证明了美帝国主义是当代最凶恶最富侵略性的帝国主义。他说：美国反动统治集团进行疯狂的扩军备战活动，正严重地威胁着世界和平。全世界人民要保卫世界和平，战胜帝国主义的战争阴谋，就必须团结起来，坚持斗争。
    中国科学院广州分院副院长黄友谋说：我们热爱和平，但争取和平必须通过斗争，即要不断地揭露和粉碎帝国主义特别是美帝国主义的战争阴谋才能实现。中国民主建国会广东省工作委员会主任委员郭棣活说：美帝国主义这种粗暴的侵略行为和战争挑衅有力地揭穿了艾森豪威尔是一个凶恶的战争贩子，而不是什么“和平使者”。
    重庆市许多厂矿企业举行了座谈会。重庆钢铁公司工人出身的副总机械师陈文敏在会上说：美帝国主义派飞机侵犯苏联的领空，充分暴露了它假和平、真备战的丑恶面目。全世界爱好和平的人民决不容许美帝国主义横行霸道。如果它们一定要挑起战争，就必将自食其果。全国群英会代表、重庆钢铁公司大型轧钢厂工程师刘谋铸说：现在事实已非常清楚，美国强盗根本不要和平。我们坚决和苏联人民以及全世界爱好和平的人民站在一起，粉碎美帝国主义的一切阴谋活动，为保卫世界和平而斗争到底。

    政协陕西省西安市委员会19日下午举行了会议。中国民主建国会西安市委员会主任委员韩望尘在会上说，艾森豪威尔派遣飞机侵入苏联领空进行罪恶的侦察活动，破坏四国首脑会议的事件，再一次证明了对帝国主义不能抱有任何幻想，只有坚持斗争，才能保卫世界和平。中国民主促进会西安市委员会主任委员李祥生说，不久以前，美帝国主义勾结日本反动派签订了日美军事同盟条约，使日本成为它在亚洲的战争策源地；最近美帝国主义又公然派遣军用飞机侵入苏联，破坏四大国首脑会议，这些事件，一次又一次地撕破了美帝国主义“和平使者”的假面具。中国农工民主党西安市委员会秘书长周幼铭说，赫鲁晓夫的声明完全是正义的声音，这个声明打中了美帝国主义的痛处，撕下了艾森豪威尔的伪装，把战争贩子的狰狞面目一下子暴露在全世界面前。
    据新华社讯　捷克斯洛伐克广大劳动人民17日纷纷举行集会。布拉格汽车修理厂的工人在一致通过的决议上写道：“我们完全同意赫鲁晓夫的观点。我们重新回忆起，我们之所以在第二次世界大战以前失去了民族独立，就是帝国主义所采取的那些方法的结果。”俄斯特拉发的矿工乌尔克斯说：“赫鲁晓夫做得对，我跟全世界劳动人民一道，欢迎苏联政府首脑坚定的、不妥协的立场。”乌斯蒂州内西哈乡人民委员会的书记说：“我完全同意赫鲁晓夫同志对美国政府的警告”。各陆军部队也举行了许多支持赫鲁晓夫的声明的集会。某部队的司令员特雷夫尼在集会上说，美国代表宣布他们将继续侵犯领空，这样就等于公开地说，他们不要和平。
    据新华社讯　从5月17日起，保加利亚全国各地的劳动人民纷纷举行集会，坚决支持苏联政府的声明。许多工厂、企业、机关的职工在群众集会上还一致通过了给苏联政府或苏联驻保加利亚大使馆的电报，表示支持赫鲁晓夫的声明，并愤怒谴责美帝国主义破坏政府首脑会议的无赖行径。瓦尔纳市的“季米特洛夫”造船和修理工厂的职工打电报给苏联大使馆说，我们工厂的职工愤怒抗议千方百计破坏政府首脑会晤的美帝国主义者。
    据新华社讯　蒙古许多工业企业、建筑工地、机关和学校17日纷纷举行群众集会。制鞋女工巴达姆加拉夫在工业合作社的职工大会上说，既然美国总统艾森豪威尔不但不谴责美国黩武主义者的强盗行为，反而表示美国今后还要继续这种飞行，那么怎能进行有成效的首脑会议和解决迫切的国际问题呢？在乌兰巴托电影制片厂的职工大会上，发言的人一致指出，巴黎会议的不成功的结局，是美国统治集团和军人的挑衅政策的直接结果，这些人竟厚颜无耻地声明今后还要对社会主义阵营采取侵略行动。
