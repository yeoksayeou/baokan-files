    To adapt to the needs of teaching reform and present a gift to the meeting of cultural and educational heroes, Jiangsu Province, under the direct leadership of the Provincial Party Committee, has established a Textbook Editorial Committee. It has now gathered a large number of personnel to rush to compile educational plans, teaching syllabi, and a complete set of textbooks for the teaching reform of primary and secondary schools in the second half of the year. Currently, the first draft has been basically completed and is undergoing further comprehensive review.
    More than 1,600 teachers and students from Nanjing Normal College, Jiangsu Normal College, Nanjing University, Nanjing Institute of Physical Education, and some primary and secondary school teachers from various special districts and cities participated in the work of compiling plans, syllabi, and textbooks. In order to better connect the content of the textbooks with practical production, more than 100 students from Nanjing Normal School were also organized to conduct investigations and research in more than 200 factories, enterprises, and people's communes to collect materials. During the writing process, teachers from many primary and secondary schools in Nanjing and personnel from relevant departments were constantly invited to participate in seminars, discussions, and manuscript review. Educational workers throughout the province have also attached great importance to and supported the work of compiling textbooks. They sent more than 90 reference materials exposing the phenomena of "less, slow, poor, and expensive" that existed in previous textbooks and teaching methods, more than 170 teaching syllabi and plans for various subjects, and primary and secondary school teachers from various places also recommended about 125,000 entries of Chinese language articles.
    The work of compiling textbooks this time is based on Vice Premier Lu Dingyi's spirit of "teaching must be reformed" and carried out in accordance with the basic requirements of teaching reform of "appropriately shortening the years, appropriately increasing the degree, appropriately controlling class hours, and appropriately increasing labor." The newly compiled textbooks for each subject generally establish new systems, strengthen the connection between theory and practical production, improve the requirements for experiments and internships, attach importance to reflecting the new achievements of modern science, generally increase the degree, and pay attention to the connection between upper and lower levels and the connection between left and right. All comrades participating in the writing work, under the slogan of "presenting gifts to the cultural and educational heroes of the province and the country," displayed soaring energy and raced against time, finally completing the first draft in just twelve days. Now, they are stepping up the review, striving to complete all the review and printing work before the end of May.

    适应教学改革需要　向文教群英会献礼
    江苏突击编写全套教材
    本报讯　为了适应教学改革的需要，江苏省在省委直接领导下成立了教材编辑委员会，现已集中了大批人力，突击编写下半年中小学教学改革的教育计划、教学大纲和全套教材，目前，初稿已经基本上完成，正进一步全面审查。
    参加这次编写计划、大纲和教材工作的有南京师范学院、江苏师范学院、南京大学、南京体育学院等高等院校教师、学生，和各专区、市的部分中小学教师，总计一千六百余人。为了使教材内容能更好地联系生产实际，还组织了南京市师范专科学校的学生一百多人深入到二百多个工厂、企业、人民公社进行了调查研究，搜集资料。在编写过程中，不断吸收南京市许多中小学教师和有关部门的人员参加座谈、讨论和审稿工作。全省各地教育工作者对这次编写教材的工作也给予了极大的重视和支持。他们送来了有关揭露以往教材和教学方法中存在的少慢差费现象的参考材料九十多份，各科教学大纲和方案一百七十多种，各地中小学教师还推荐了语文篇目约十二万五千篇次。
    这次编写教材的工作是根据陆定一副总理的“教学必须改革”的精神，按照“适当缩短年限，适当提高程度，适当控制学时，适当增加劳动”的教学改革基本要求进行的。新编的各科教材，一般都建立了新的体系，加强了理论与生产实际的联系，提高了实验和实习的要求，重视了反映现代科学的新成就，程度一般都有所提高，并且注意了上下衔接和左右联系。参加编写工作的全体同志在“向全省和全国文教群英会献礼”的口号下，发挥了冲天干劲，分秒必争，终于在短短十二天中就完成了初稿。现在，他们正在加紧审查，力争在5月底前完成全部审稿和排印工作。
