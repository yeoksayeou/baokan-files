    Fully Utilize Home-Grown and Wild Aromatic Plants to Create Wealth for the Nation
    Many Regions Develop the Fragrance Industry Using Indigenous Methods
    (Our Dispatch) With the high-speed development of the entire national economy, China's fragrance industry is accelerating its pace. At present, there are more than 300 types of fragrance industry products in various regions, an increase of more than fifteen times compared with the early days after liberation. In 1959, the output of fragrances and perfumes increased ninefold compared with 1953. This year, the output of the fragrance industry will increase by about one time compared with last year, and the product quality has greatly improved. The development of the fragrance industry plays an important role in supporting industrial production, increasing the income of people's communes, and accumulating national funds.
    China is extremely rich in wild aromatic plant resources. During the "small autumn harvest" campaign last year, various regions collected a large number of wild aromatic plants, and initially clarified the details of wild aromatic plants. More than 300 types have been discovered and can be utilized in various regions. Anhui Province has identified more than 100 types of wild plants that can be used to extract fragrances, with an estimated annual output of more than 14 million dan.
    Last year, during the "small autumn harvest" campaign, various regions launched a mass movement to process wild aromatic plants on the spot. A surge of communes running factories and everyone participating emerged in many regions. This mass movement of using indigenous methods for on-site processing promoted the rapid development of China's fragrance industry. In early 1958, there was only one fragrance factory in Anhui Province. Last year, it developed to more than 800, of which more than 600 were indigenous processing factories run by communes. Many fragrance factories in various regions have been gradually improved through technological transformation, from indigenous to modern, and from small to large. The West Lake Fragrance Factory in Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province, initially had only three people, using a distillation pot converted from a stainless steel pot for production. In just over a year, it has developed into a medium-sized fragrance factory and has shifted from producing aromatic oils to producing synthetic fragrances. Last year, the output value reached more than 2.4 million yuan. The fragrance factories affiliated to the Shanghai Oil and Grease Chemical Industry Company have recently successfully trial-produced many new products using wild aromatic plants through the technological innovation movement and have begun mass production.
    Many regions have also vigorously promoted the artificial cultivation of aromatic plants and established natural fragrance raw material bases. At present, the planting area of citronella grass for fragrance throughout the country has increased sevenfold compared with 1954. There are 25 state-owned farms in Guangdong Province that plant aromatic plants, of which seven mainly produce fragrances, forming a relatively large-scale natural fragrance raw material base in China. The Fuzhou Fragrance Factory in Fujian Province has established ties with communes and established more than 100,000 mu of fragrance bases this year, laying the foundation for future production development. Pingyin in Shandong, a famous rose-producing area, the suburbs of Beijing, and Sanlintang in Shanghai have all expanded the planting area of roses in recent years and have begun to produce rose oil, the most valuable product in fragrances.
    Now is the time when roses are in bloom, and many regions and relevant units are actively collecting roses and extracting rose oil. The Ministry of Light Industry has also organized experienced workers and technicians from Shanghai, Beijing, Jinan, and other places to teach processing techniques in Shanxi, Gansu, Inner Mongolia, Jilin, and other places.

### 充分利用家生和野生香料植物为国家创造财富  许多地区用土法发展香料工业

    充分利用家生和野生香料植物为国家创造财富
    许多地区用土法发展香料工业
    本报讯　随着整个国民经济的高速度发展，我国香料工业加快了前进的步伐。目前，各地香料工业的产品已有三百多种，比解放初期增加十五倍以上。1959年香料、香精产量比1953年增加九倍，今年，香料工业的产量将比去年增长一倍左右，产品质量大有提高。香料工业的发展，对支援工业生产，增加人民公社收入，积累国家资金，都起着重要作用。
    我国野生香料植物的资源极为丰富。在去年“小秋收”运动中，各地采集了大量的野生香料植物，并初步摸清了野生香料植物的底细，各地已经发现并可以利用的就有三百多种。安徽省已查明可提炼香料的野生植物就有一百多种，估计年产量可达一千四百多万担。
    去年各地在“小秋收”运动中，开展了野生香料植物就地加工的群众运动。许多地区出现了社社办厂、人人动手的热潮。这种用土法就地加工的群众运动，促进了我国香料工业的飞跃发展。安徽省1958年初全省仅有一个香料厂，去年发展到八百多个，其中有六百多个是公社办的土法加工厂。许多地区的香料厂经过技术改造，已由土到洋，由小到大，逐步提高。浙江省杭州市西湖香料厂，初办时仅三个人，用一只钢精锅改成的蒸馏锅搞生产，仅仅一年多时间，已发展成为中型香料厂，并已由生产芳香油提高到生产合成香料，去年产值达到二百四十多万元。上海油脂化学工业公司所属各香料厂，最近通过技术革新运动，利用野生香料植物试制成功许多新产品，并已开始成批生产。
    许多地区还大抓香料植物的人工栽培，建立天然香料原料基地。目前全国香料茅草的种植面积，比1954年增加了七百倍。广东省有二十五个国营农场种植香料植物，其中有七个以生产香料为主，形成了我国规模较大的天然香料原料基地。福建省福州香料厂与公社挂钩，今年建立了十万多亩香料基地，为今后发展生产奠定了基础。以盛产玫瑰著名的山东平阴、北京市郊及上海三林塘等地，近年来都扩大了玫瑰的种植面积，并已开始生产香料中最名贵的产品玫瑰油。
    现在正是玫瑰花开的时候，许多地区和有关单位都在积极采集玫瑰花，提制玫瑰油。轻工业部还组织上海、北京、济南等地有经验的工人和技术人员，到山西、甘肃、内蒙古、吉林等地传授加工技术。
