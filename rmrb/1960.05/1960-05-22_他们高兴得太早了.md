        They Are Rejoicing Too Soon
        By Our Staff Commentator
    A few days ago, U.S. imperialism and the Turkish reactionaries thought that their bloody suppression of the Turkish people's struggle had been "effective," and therefore began to rejoice. A U.S. State Department spokesman said that the situation in Turkey had "significantly eased"; Turkish Foreign Minister Zorlu also said that the "importance" of student demonstrations had been "exaggerated." However, they are rejoicing a bit too soon.
    Isn't that so? The U.S.-Turkish reactionaries had not been complacent for a few days when on May 14, Ankara once again erupted into massive demonstrations against the Menderes traitorous dictatorial regime; tens of thousands of young people in Istanbul and Izmir took to the streets. They shouted: "Down with the dictators," "We want freedom," "Menderes resign!" On May 19, new demonstrations took place in Ankara and Istanbul, and the grief-stricken masses flocked to the Turkish Independence War Memorial to mourn the loss of independence and freedom of the Turkish nation, and strongly protested against the terrorist dictatorial rule of U.S. imperialist lackeys. And on May 20, Ankara once again erupted into a mass demonstration of tens of thousands of people against the Menderes regime. The premature laughter of the U.S.-Turkish reactionaries was drowned in the surging torrent of the Turkish people's struggle.
    The continuous outbreaks of large-scale demonstrations in Ankara and other Turkish cities clearly show that any imperialism and reactionaries who want to use guns and cannons, use massacre to scare back the masses of people who are fighting for a just cause, cannot succeed. The bloodstains on the streets of Ankara have not yet dried, and the Turkish people have repeatedly bravely broken through martial law, broken through cordon lines, converged into a torrent of tens of thousands of people, and fought with the military police in the fog of tear gas. The Turkish reactionaries will never be able to solve its deep contradictions with the broad masses of people with violence.
    Now the Menderes government is intensifying its frantic suppression internally, and externally it is more desperately acting as an accomplice to U.S. imperialism. On May 9, the Turkish puppet parliament approved the U.S.-Turkish bilateral military agreement, tightly binding Turkey to the U.S. war chariot. All this can only promote the further awakening and unity of the people. As long as U.S. imperialism does not get out of Turkey for one day, and as long as the rule of U.S. imperialism's lackeys in Turkey does not collapse for one day, the Turkish people's patriotic and just struggle will continue to develop until the day of final victory.

    他们高兴得太早了  
    本报评论员
    前些天，美帝国主义和土耳其反动派以为它们对土耳其人民斗争的血腥镇压已经“收效”，因而开始高兴起来。美国国务院发言人说，土耳其局势已“显著缓和”了；土耳其外交部长佐鲁也说，学生示威的“重要性”被“夸大”了。但是，他们高兴得未免过早了。
    不是吗？美土反动派得意了没有几天，5月14日安卡拉就再度爆发了反对曼德列斯卖国独裁政权的声势浩大的示威；伊斯坦布尔和伊兹密尔成千上万的年青人走上街头。他们高呼：“打倒独裁者”、“我们要自由”、“曼德列斯辞职”！5月19日在安卡拉、伊斯坦布尔又有新的示威，悲愤的群众涌向土耳其独立战争纪念碑去悼念土耳其民族失去了的独立和自由，对美帝国主义走狗的恐怖独裁统治发出了强烈的抗议。而5月20日，安卡拉又一次爆发了反对曼德列斯政权的万人大示威。美土反动派过早发出的笑声，被淹没在土耳其人民汹涌澎湃的斗争怒涛里了。
    安卡拉和其他土耳其城市持续不断地爆发大示威清楚地表明，任何帝国主义和反动派要想用枪炮、用屠杀来吓退为正义事业而斗争的人民群众，是办不到的。安卡拉街头的血迹未干，土耳其人民一再英勇地冲破戒严令，冲破警戒线，汇成万人的巨流，在催泪弹的迷雾里，同军警搏斗。土耳其反动派用暴力是永远解决不了它同广大人民的深刻矛盾的。
    现在曼德列斯政府对内正在加紧进行疯狂的镇压，对外则更加死心踏地地为美帝国主义充当帮凶，5月9日土耳其御用议会批准了美国—土耳其双边军事协定，把土耳其紧紧地绑在美国战车上。这一切，都只能促使人民的进一步觉醒和团结。只要美帝国主义一天不滚出土耳其，美帝国主义在土耳其的走狗的统治一天不垮台，土耳其人民的爱国正义斗争就将继续发展下去，直到最后胜利的一天。
