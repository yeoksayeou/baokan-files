    South Korean People's Hearts Lean Toward the North
    —Visiting a South Korean Youth Who Participated in the Seoul Demonstrations
    Xinhua News Agency reporter Wang Yuzhang

    I interviewed Lian Dongzhu, a young man who had participated in the Seoul people's demonstrations and had just arrived in northern Korea, in Pyongyang. He told reporters that coming to northern Korea from South Korea was like going from a dark hell to paradise, and that the hearts of the South Korean people were all turned towards the North. He firmly believed that the South Korean people, united, could drive out the American army and reunify the fatherland.

    Lian Dongzhu, a young man who participated in the April 19th Seoul people's demonstrations against the US-Lee group, said that the South Korean people simply could not survive under the rule of the US-Lee group. People are utterly fed up with the American devils and the traitor Syngman Rhee.

    Twenty-five-year-old Lian Dongzhu has not had a single good day in the fifteen years of the US-Lee group's rule over South Korea. The son of a tenant farmer first worked as a farmhand for a landlord, and for the past two years he has been wandering in Seoul, living day to day by doing odd jobs and scavenging. He said that in Seoul, tens of thousands of unemployed people starve to death without anyone caring. Many people pick through the garbage dumps for leftovers discarded by Americans, and many sleep in the parks. When they get together, they curse the American devils and Syngman Rhee.

    Lian Dongzhu waved his fist and said that many of us unemployed people participated in the "April 19th" Seoul people's demonstrations against the US-Lee group. On the 19th, we went with the university students to attack the "Central Government Building," the location of Lee's puppet cabinet. Braving the bullets fired by the police, they charged all the way up to the third floor of the "Central Government Building," tore up the "official documents" of the US-Syngman Rhee group—documents that oppressed the people—and threw them all over the streets. They also stormed Syngman Rhee's residence—the Kyungmu Palace—and destroyed several "police stations." Lian Dongzhu said that when we were charging towards the "government" building through the tear gas fired by the police, our eyes were streaming with tears, and the nearby residents brought out water for us to wash our faces. When we attacked the residence of Lee Ki-poong, Syngman Rhee's main henchman, we ran out of stones in our hands and pockets, and the nearby residents tore tiles from their own houses to give us as "ammunition." When we attacked the Kyungmu Palace, the windows of the nearby buildings and the roofs of the buses on the streets were all full of people, who applauded and shouted, "Well done!"

    Lian Dongzhu arrived in northern Korea on April 25th. I met him at a guest house at the foot of Moranbong in Pyongyang. He was wearing a brand-new set of clothes and had just had a haircut. He said with a beaming smile that northern Korea is truly a happy world for the working people. I saw with my own eyes that the rows of five- and six-story buildings along the streets of Pyongyang were all residences for workers. In Seoul, the best the working people can hope for is to live in shacks or broken tents. He said that he still has a father, mother, brother, and sister at home in South Korea, all working as farmhands for landlords and suffering from hardship. However, he said with confidence: Now the South Korean people have united to fight, and we will definitely be able to drive out the American army and reunify our fatherland.

### 南朝鲜人民心向北方——访问一位参加汉城示威斗争的南朝鲜青年

    南朝鲜人民心向北方
    ——访问一位参加汉城示威斗争的南朝鲜青年
    新华社记者　王玉章
    我在平壤访问了一位曾经参加汉城人民示威斗争而刚到朝鲜北部的青年廉东柱。他告诉记者说，由南朝鲜来到朝鲜北部就像从黑暗的地狱到了天堂，南朝鲜人民的心都向着北方。他坚决相信南朝鲜人民团结起来就能赶走美军，统一祖国。
    曾经参加4月19日汉城人民示威斗争的青年廉东柱说，南朝鲜人民在美李集团的统治下，实在活不下去了。人们已经恨透了美国佬和卖国贼李承晚。
    二十五岁的廉东柱在美李集团统治南朝鲜的十五年中没有过一天好日子。这个佃农的儿子先给地主当长工，最近两年流浪在汉城，天天靠打零工、拣破烂过活，他说，汉城市成千上万的失业者，饿死没人管。有很多人到垃圾堆里拣美国人吃剩的东西吃，有很多人睡在公园里。他们聚在一起就咒骂美国佬和李承晚。
    廉东柱挥动着拳头说，这次“四·一九”汉城人民举行反对美李集团的示威斗争，我们很多失业者都参加了。19日当天，我们同大学生们一起去攻打李伪内阁所在地“中央厅”。他们冒着警察射来的枪弹，一直冲上了“中央厅”大厦的三楼，撕毁了美国—李承晚集团的“公文”——压迫人民的文件，把它们扔得满街满地。他们还冲击了李承晚的住所——景武台，摧毁了好几个“派出所”。廉东柱说，当我们冒着警察发射的催泪弹的烟雾向“政府”大厦冲锋弄得眼泪不停地流的时候，附近的居民都拿出水来给我们洗脸，我们攻击李承晚的主要帮凶李起鹏的住宅的时候，把手里的和口袋里的石头打光了，附近的居民从自己的房子上拆下瓦来给我们当“弹药”。我们攻打景武台的时候，附近的楼窗上、街道上的公共汽车顶上都站满了人，他们鼓掌，高呼“打得好哇！”
    廉东柱是在4月25日来到朝鲜北部的。记者在平壤市牡丹峰山麓的一个招待所里会见了他。他穿着一身崭新的衣服，刚刚理过发。他满面笑容地说，朝鲜北部真是劳动人民幸福的世界。我亲眼看到，平壤街道两旁一排接一排的五六层的大楼都是职工们的住宅。在汉城，劳动人民最好也只能住在板棚里或者破帐棚里。他说，他在南朝鲜的家中还有父亲、母亲、哥哥和妹妹，都在给地主当长工，受着折磨。但是，他充满信心地说：现在南朝鲜人民已经团结起来进行斗争了，我们一定能够把美国军队赶出去，统一我们的祖国。
