	Respected Premier Zhou Enlai, Respected Vice Premier Chen Yi, Comrades, Friends:

	After a short but warm and friendly visit, you are about to embark on your journey home. I would like to express the most cordial and warmest respect of the Vietnamese people to Premier Comrade, Vice Premier Comrade, and all the accompanying comrades, and through you, to the great Chinese people, our brothers, and wish the Chinese people even greater victories in the cause of building socialism and defending world peace.

	In the past few days, you have visited many places in our country, including cities, rural areas, factories, schools, and agricultural production cooperatives, and have been in contact with Vietnamese workers, farmers, intellectuals, and people from other walks of life. Wherever you went, the Vietnamese people welcomed you with the warm atmosphere of celebrating the Vietnam-China friendship festival. Our entire nation has been very pleased to follow your visit through newspapers and Voice of Vietnam radio.

	You held talks with the Party and government leaders of our country. We have reached a complete consensus on the current international situation and on the need to heighten vigilance and strengthen the struggle to defend peace. We both believe that for the benefit of our two countries, for the benefit of the socialist camp, and also for world peace, democracy, national independence, and the cause of socialism, it is necessary to strengthen the relationship of mutual assistance and cooperation between the two countries and to strengthen the unity of all countries in the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

	We are extremely happy with the successful results of your friendly visit. At the time of parting, on behalf of the Vietnamese people, I would like to extend my greetings to you and hope that you will have the opportunity to visit Vietnam again. At that time, our country will definitely be more beautiful than it is now.

	I wish you comrades a safe journey and good health!

    范文同总理的讲话
    新华社河内14日电　范文同总理14日在机场欢送周恩来总理时的讲话全文：敬爱的周恩来总理同志，敬爱的陈毅副总理同志，同志们，朋友们：
    在进行了短促而充满热情的友好访问之后，你们即将启程回国。我谨向总理同志、副总理同志及随行的全体同志，并通过你们向兄弟般的伟大中国人民表达越南人民最亲切、最热烈的敬意，祝中国人民在建设社会主义和保卫世界和平的事业中取得更大的胜利。
    在过去几天中，你们参观了我们国家的许多地方，包括城市、农村、工厂、学校和农业生产合作社，同越南工人、农民、知识分子和其他阶层人民进行了接触。你们所到的地方，越南人民都以像过越中友好节日的热烈气氛来迎接了你们。我们全国人民非常高兴地通过报纸和越南之声电台注视你们的访问。
    你们同我们国家党政领导人举行了会谈。我们双方对当前国际局势、对提高警惕和加强保卫和平的斗争的必要性问题，已经取得了完全一致的看法。我们双方一致认为，为了我们两国的利益，为了社会主义阵营的利益，也是为了世界和平、民主、民族独立和社会主义事业的利益，必须加强两国之间的互助合作关系，加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的团结一致。
    对你们这次友好访问所取得的美满成果，我们感到万分高兴。在临别的时候，我谨代表越南人民谨向你们致意，并希望你们有机会再来越南访问，那时候，我们的国家一定会比现在变得更加美好。
    祝同志们一路平安，身体健康！
