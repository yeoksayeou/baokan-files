Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch from Washington: Under the condemnation of worldwide public opinion, U.S. Secretary of State Herter was forced on the 9th to issue a statement, further admitting that the U.S. government's policy is to have U.S. aircraft invade Soviet airspace for espionage activities.

Secretary of State Herter, together with the head of the secret service, CIA Director Allen Dulles, gave a secret briefing to some members of Congress on the incident on the 9th. After the meeting, a statement was issued making so-called "supplements and clarifications" to the State Department's statement on May 7, which had been condemned and ridiculed by people all over the world.

Herter confessed: "In accordance with the 'National Security Act' of 1947, the President (referring to Eisenhower) has, since taking office, implemented instructions to collect Soviet military intelligence by all possible means." He said, "In accordance with these instructions, various plans have been drawn up and implemented, including extensive aerial surveillance (of the Soviet Union) by unarmed civilian aircraft, which is normally conducted on the periphery, but sometimes penetrates." As everyone knows, on the 7th, the State Department tried its best to shirk its responsibility, insisting that "as far as the Washington authorities are concerned, there was no authorization for the kind of flight Mr. Khrushchev spoke of." Herter also said that the "specific missions" of these aircraft "did not need to be approved by the President," which shows that this kind of U.S. aggressive behavior has become commonplace.

In order to escape the embarrassing situation of being caught red-handed, Herter's statement, like the State Department's statement on May 7, adopted a rogue attitude, ridiculously saying that the Soviet Union "keeps its society very closed and tightly controlled," and if the U.S. government did not take those measures of invading Soviet territory to steal intelligence, "it would be abandoning its responsibility not only to the American people, but also to the free people everywhere."

### 赫脱在舆论指责下被迫招认  侵犯苏联是美国一贯政策

    赫脱在舆论指责下被迫招认
    侵犯苏联是美国一贯政策
    新华社10日讯　华盛顿消息：在全世界舆论的指责下，美国国务卿赫脱9日被迫发表声明，进一步承认，美国飞机侵犯苏联领空进行间谍活动是美国政府的国策。
    国务卿赫脱9日同特务头子、中央情报局局长艾伦·杜勒斯就这一事件向一些国会议员作了秘密汇报。会后发表了声明，对受到全世界人民谴责和耻笑的5月7日国务院声明进行所谓“补充和澄清”。
    赫脱招认：“根据1947年的‘国家安全法’，总统（指艾森豪威尔）自执政以来就把这样的指示付诸实施：用一切可能的手段搜集苏联的军事情报。”他说，“根据这些指示已经拟订并且实施了各项计划，其中包括由没有武装的民用飞机（对苏联）进行广泛的空中监视，这种监视在通常情况下在边缘进行，但是有时就穿进去了”。大家知道，在7日的时候，国务院为了推卸罪责，还是挖空心思，硬说“就华盛顿当局来说，并没有授权进行赫鲁晓夫先生所说的那种飞行。”赫脱还说，这些飞机的“具体任务并不需要经过总统批准”，这说明，美国这种侵略行径已经是惯常的事。
    为了逃避作贼被当场捉住的狼狈处境，赫脱的声明像5月7日国务院的声明一样，大耍流氓态度，居然说苏联“把自己的社会关闭得很紧，控制得很严”，如果美国政府不采取那些侵入苏联国境窃取情报的措施，“它就是放弃了不但对美国人民，而且对各地自由人民的责任”。
