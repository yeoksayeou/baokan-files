    A Million Red Flags [Note]
    [Albania] Alek Caçi

    In front of Tiananmen Square, a million red flags are waving in the wind today.
    Fly, red flags, in every place... What sounds am I hearing! The imperialists are saying: Alas, what to do!
    In Tokyo, burning hearts are churning like volcanoes. Here is flame, there is flame, our strength is as vast as the ocean!
    Imperialists, the noose is already around your necks, the Koreans are pulling tight on one end of the rope, the Japanese are pulling tight on the other end, with all their might.
    The Turks no longer want the enemy to remain at their doorstep! Africa is burning, the imperialists can no longer find a quiet corner.
    Tomorrow it will be the turn of South Vietnam, Spain, Greece, and China's territory of Taiwan.
    Freedom! How precious you are! Brothers, comrades, rise up! We have a common cry, we have a common wish. In the world, we do not want humanity to suffer the torment of enslavement again!
    In front of Tiananmen Square, today, the Chinese people's fists are raised high to the sky. And the imperialists are frightened to the point of shivering!

      May 9, 1960, in Beijing

      [Note] This poem was written by the author after participating in the rally held by people from all walks of life in the capital to support the Japanese people's just struggle.

    一百万面红旗〔注〕
    〔阿尔巴尼亚〕阿列克斯·恰奇天安门前，一百万面红旗今天在迎风招展。飘扬吧，红旗，在每一块地
  方……我听到什么样的声音！帝国主义者在说道：哎呀，怎么办！在东京，燃烧的人心，像火山一样翻腾。这里是火焰，那里是火焰，我们的力量像海洋一样广阔无边！帝国主义者，绳套已经套在脖子上面，朝
  鲜人拉紧绳索的这一头，日本人拉紧绳索的另一头，用尽他们的一切力量。土耳其人再也不愿敌人停留在他们的大门前！非洲燃烧起来了，帝国主义者再也找不到一
  块安静的角落。明天就该轮到南越、
  西班牙、希腊
  和中国的领土台湾。自由呵！你是多么可贵！兄弟们，同志们，起来！我们有共同的呼声，我们有共同的愿望。在世界上，我们不愿人类再遭受奴役的熬煎！天安门前，今天，中国人的拳头高举上天。而帝国主义者则吓得胆寒心惊！
      1960年5月9日于北京〔注〕这首诗是作者在参加
      了首都各界人民支援
      日本人民正义斗争的
      大会之后而作的。〔李宁来译　戈宝权校〕
