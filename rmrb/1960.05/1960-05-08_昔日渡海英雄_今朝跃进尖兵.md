　　Former Sea-Crossing Heroes, Today's Leap Forward Vanguard
　　Jiang Qing

　　At the end of March, a member of a people's commune in the Wengtian area, carrying a newspaper with news about the 10th anniversary of the island defense by the Sea-Crossing Vanguard Battalion of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, traveled hundreds of miles by car and on foot, and found the Sea-Crossing Vanguard Battalion covered in dust. He said excitedly, "Ten years! The Vanguard Battalion is still defending our Hainan Island! We miss you so much!" This ordinary commune member was one of the first to welcome the landing of the liberation army back then, and he came specifically to visit the officers and soldiers. His sentiments reflect the boundless love and concern of the Hainan people for this heroic unit.

　　What about the Sea-Crossing Vanguard Battalion, which participated in the liberation, defense, and construction of Hainan Island for ten years? On the eve of the tenth anniversary of the liberation of Hainan Island, we climbed into the deep mountains and dense forests of the Wuzhi Mountain area and visited this heroic unit stationed at the foot of the majestic Wuzhi Mountain.

　　Sun Youli, the former battalion commander of the Sea-Crossing Vanguard Battalion, introduced us to the situation of the troops when they first arrived in Hainan in a thatched bamboo-walled grass shed. The Sea-Crossing Vanguard Battalion was one of the first troops to land on Hainan Island from the mainland ten years ago. Under the wise command of the Party and superiors, all the officers and soldiers of their battalion took twenty-two ordinary sailboats, rode the wind and waves, and crossed more than four hundred miles of turbulent and stormy seas. Finally, they broke through the so-called three-dimensional land, sea, and air defense of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and landed on Hainan while sailing and fighting. After landing on the island, with the close cooperation and support of the Qiongya Column and the people of Hainan, they fought thousands of miles with the superior enemy for thirty-nine days, and finally welcomed the victorious landing of the main force, and together with the brother troops, liberated the entire Hainan Island. Therefore, they were awarded the honorary title of "Sea-Crossing Vanguard Battalion" by their superiors, and all the officers and soldiers of the battalion were given a major merit award, becoming the "Major Merit Hero Battalion."

　　"The victory of the Sea-Crossing Vanguard Battalion is the victory of Mao Zedong's military thought." Sun Youli solemnly explained to us, "Before landing on the island, our troops had no experience in sea-crossing operations. However, due to following Chairman Mao's teaching that the people's army is fighting a people's war, the troops united and relied on the masses of the people everywhere, learned from the fishermen, and humbly learned techniques such as sailing and swimming. During the arduous marching and fighting of the troops in various places, tens of thousands of people formed stretcher teams and grain transportation teams to follow closely behind, and they stood guard for the troops, sent intelligence, and rescued the wounded. Without such full support from the people, victory would be unimaginable." Sun Youli was already the superior commander of the Sea-Crossing Vanguard Battalion and was very familiar with the battalion. He said, "In the ten years since the war, it is precisely because we have continued to follow the teachings of the Party and Chairman Mao that the troops have shared weal and woe with the people everywhere in defending and building Hainan, always carried forward the glorious tradition, and achieved great progress."

　　The honorary red flags hanging in the battalion and company clubs, and some of the unit's deeds, supplemented Comrade Sun Youli's introduction for us. For ten years, the troops have been vigilantly guarding the coast while striving to improve their political awareness, combat skills, and cultural level. The Sea-Crossing Vanguard Battalion has achieved excellent results in successive large-scale mass training movements. The big red flag of "Cultural Excellence Battalion" was obtained in the largest cultural learning movement after the war in 1951. At that time, under the strong leadership of the Party, the masses were mobilized, and the officers and soldiers overcame various difficulties, using the beach as paper, tree branches as pens, and scraped pot ashes as ink; the coconut grove was used as a classroom during the day, and they still read books under the covers with flashlights at night. After more than half a year of mass shock movement, 90% of the illiterate people leaped to the level of ordinary elementary school students, becoming one of the advanced units of the Hainan garrison. In the era of the Great Leap Forward, red flags continued to appear in the Sea-Crossing Vanguard Battalion. The training scores in all subjects were excellent, and many classes, platoons, and companies with all-red shooting scores emerged. Inspired by the General Line, the officers and soldiers emancipated their minds, vigorously promoted the communist spirit of collaboration, and in single-gun combat shooting, the scores of more than 95% of the officers and soldiers reached excellent.

　　Many of the old heroes of the Sea-Crossing Vanguard Battalion who fought in the sea-crossing operation back then have been transferred to new leadership positions, and there are not many left now. However, the glorious tradition of the troops has been passed down from generation to generation, cultivating a large number of new models and meritorious personnel. We saw a statistic that was less than ten years old, that the number of meritorious personnel and activists who emerged in the Sea-Crossing Vanguard Battalion has reached more than 3,400! Huang Jijie, the battalion's latest second-class merit recipient, was a new recruit who joined the army only last year. Under the guidance and help of veteran comrades, Huang Jijie buried himself in studying a urgently needed technological innovation soon after joining the army. He failed three times in a row, but he did not waver or lose heart. Finally, he created a very practical tool and promoted it in the troops. When the battalion commander asked him with a smile why he could create this tool, the new soldier also smiled and replied frankly: "I came to defend our motherland's Hainan Island. Our company is the 'Resourceful and Tenacious Company', and the class is the 'Hero First Class'. If I don't work hard, how can I carry forward the glorious tradition left by the old comrades?"

　　The officers and soldiers of the Sea-Crossing Vanguard Battalion kept in mind the teaching of "People's Army, People's War" and actively participated in and supported the local socialist construction everywhere. We met Chen Laizhuo, a staff officer in the battalion, who had just returned from leading a rural work team to the countryside. They helped the masses in the Li villages, and their achievements were outstanding. He not only ate, lived, and worked with the Li compatriots, but also taught the Li compatriots advanced rice transplanting techniques and experience in accumulating and composting fertilizers, helped night schools with literacy classes at night, and also provided haircuts for the Li compatriots, separated rooms for maternity hospitals, repaired slopes, etc., thinking carefully and doing meticulously. In just one month, the Li compatriots loved him like a relative, and when he left, they were reluctant to part, composing and singing many mountain songs to bid farewell to this officer of the Sea-Crossing Vanguard Battalion. Over the past decade, the Sea-Crossing Vanguard Battalion has contributed tens of thousands of labor days to the garrison area for fertilizing, repairing dams, treating diseases, and disaster relief. In 1958, under the conditions of very busy training, the officers and soldiers also enthusiastically supported agricultural production with 15,000 labor days. When building the Shuixi and other two reservoirs, they completed the one-month target in half a month, and were awarded the two big red flags of "Water Conservancy Vanguard" and "People's Children Love Labor" by the local Party committee.

　　The Sea-Crossing Vanguard Battalion has been loyally defending the motherland for ten years as one day, and the officers and soldiers are continuing to stride forward.

    昔日渡海英雄  今朝跃进尖兵
    江青
    3月末，一个翁田地区的人民公社社员，带着一张刊有解放军某部渡海先锋营守岛十年消息的报纸，坐车走路赶了几百里，风尘仆仆地找到了渡海先锋营。他兴奋万分地说：“十年啦，先锋营还保卫着我们海南岛啊！我们可想念你们了！”这个普通社员是当年最早迎接解放大军登陆中的一个，他赶来是专为看望官兵们。他的心情，反映了海南人民对这支英雄部队的无限热爱和关怀。
    十年来，参与解放、保卫和建设海南岛的渡海先锋营，他们怎么样啊？海南岛解放十周年的前夕，我们登上了深山密林的五指山区，访问了驻守在巍峨的五指山麓的这支英雄部队。
    当年渡海先锋营的营长孙有礼，在茅顶竹墙的草篷里为我们介绍了部队初到海南的情况。渡海先锋营是十年前首批从大陆登上了海南岛的一支部队。在党和上级的英明指挥下，他们全营官兵分乘二十二只普通帆船，乘风破浪，穿过波涛汹涌、风雨交加的四百多里海面，终于突破蒋匪军的所谓陆海空立体防御，边驶边打地登上了海南。上岛后，他们在琼崖纵队和海南人民的密切配合和支援下，又与优势的敌人转战千里，奋战三十九天，终于迎接了大部队胜利登陆，最后和兄弟部队并肩解放了海南全岛。因此，被上级授予了“渡海先锋营”的荣誉称号，全营官兵并各记大功一次，成为“大功功臣营”。
    “渡海先锋营的胜利，是毛主席军事思想的胜利。”孙有礼郑重地为我们解释说：“上岛前，我们部队毫无渡海作战的经验。但是由于遵循毛主席的教导：人民军队进行的是人民战争。部队处处团结和依靠人民群众，拜渔民为师，虚心学会驾船、游水等技术。部队在各地艰苦地行军作战中，成千上万群众组成的担架队、运粮队就尾随着奔走，并为部队站岗放哨、送情报、抢救伤员。如果没有人民的这样全力支援，胜利是不能设想的。”孙有礼早就是渡海先锋营的上级指挥员，对营很熟悉。他说：“战后十年来，也正是由于继续遵循了党和毛主席的教导，部队在保卫和建设海南中，处处与人民同甘共苦，始终发扬了光荣传统，取得了巨大的进步。”
    在营、连俱乐部里满挂着的荣誉红旗，和部队的一些事迹材料，为我们充实了孙有礼同志的介绍。十年来，部队一边持枪警惕地保卫海防，一边努力提高政治觉悟、作战本领和文化水平。渡海先锋营在历次大规模的群众性训练运动中，都取得了十分优异的成绩。“文化优胜营”的大红旗，就是在1951年战后规模最大的一次文化学习运动中获得的。当时在党的坚强领导下，放手发动了群众，官兵们就战胜了各种困难，用沙滩做纸，树枝当笔，刮锅灰为墨；白天以椰林当课堂，深夜还蒙在被里用电筒照着读书。全营经过半年多的群众性突击运动，90％的文盲，一跃达到普通高小程度，成为了海南驻军的先进单位之一。在大跃进的年代中，渡海先锋营里更是红旗不断，训练的各科成绩都是总评优秀，还涌现了许多射击满堂红的班、排、连。官兵们在总路线的鼓舞下，解放思想，大兴共产主义协作之风，在单枪战斗射击中，全营95％以上的官兵成绩达到了优秀。
    营里当年渡海作战的老英雄们，有不少人已经调到了新的领导岗位，现在留的不多。但是部队的光荣传统代代相传，培养了大批新的模范、功臣。我们看到了一份不满十年的统计，渡海先锋营里涌现的功臣、积极分子等，累计已经达到三千四百多人次！营里最新的一个二等功臣黄继杰，就是去年才入伍的新兵。黄继杰在老同志们的带动和帮助下，到部队不久，就白天黑夜地埋头钻研一项急需的技术革新。他连续三次失败也没有动摇和灰心。最后终于制成了一件很适用的工具，在部队中推广了。当营首长笑着问他为什么能创造出这件工具时，新战士也笑着爽朗地回答说：“我是来保卫祖国海南岛的。我们连是‘机智顽强连’，班又是‘英雄第一班’，我不努力，怎样发扬老同志留下的光荣传统呢？”
    渡海先锋营的官兵们牢记“人民军队、人民战争”的教导，随处都积极参加和支援了当地的社会主义建设。我们会见了营里的一个参谋陈来灼，他刚领导一个农村工作组下乡回来。他们在黎村中帮助群众工作，成绩很出色。他不仅跟黎胞同吃同住同劳动，而且向黎胞传授先进的插秧技术和积肥沤肥的经验，夜晚帮助夜校上课扫盲，休息时还为黎胞理发、为产妇院隔房间、修整坡路等，想得周到，做得细致。短短一月，黎胞们热爱他如亲人，临走时依依不舍，编唱许多山歌来送别渡海先锋营的这位军官。十年来，渡海先锋营为驻地积肥、修坝、治病、抢险等献出了数以万计的劳动日。1958年在各项训练十分繁忙的情况下，官兵们也热情支援农业生产一万五千个劳动日，在兴修水西等两个水库时，半月完成了一月的指标，曾获得了地方党委赠送的“水利先锋”和“人民子弟爱劳动”两面大红旗。
    渡海先锋营十年如一日地忠诚保卫着祖国，官兵们在继续阔步前进着。
