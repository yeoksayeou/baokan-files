	Shanxi Organizes Large-Scale Wheat Harvesting Machinery Cooperation
	The major wheat-producing areas of Jinan, Jinzhong, and the suburbs of Taiyuan in Shanxi Province are implementing large-scale cooperation for harvesting machinery.

	A batch of combine harvesters and rocker arm harvesters, drawn from Jinzhong area and Taiyuan City, where wheat harvesting is later, formed a mechanized wheat harvesting cooperation team. At the end of May, they went to the Jinan area, where the season is earlier, to support wheat harvesting. The Jinan area also decided that immediately after wheat harvesting is completed, it would organize combine harvesters and rocker arm harvesters to go north to support wheat harvesting in Jinzhong and Taiyuan areas. Counties in the wheat-harvesting areas also launched counterpart support in machinery according to the order of the wheat harvesting season. In Jinan Prefecture alone, more than 800 machines of various types participated in counterpart support. This mutual cooperation provides a guarantee for quick harvesting and threshing of wheat.

	Shandong Deploys Flood Prevention Work Early
	While adhering to the fight against drought, Shandong Province is rapidly preparing for all flood prevention and drainage measures to resolutely overcome drought and flood disasters. This year, Shandong's flood prevention faces more complex situations and problems than in the past: the flood prevention area has been greatly expanded after a large number of water conservancy projects have been completed; the newly built projects have not been tested by floods; the annual repairs of some old projects have not been well completed; and some drainage systems are not sound enough after the large-scale development of garden plots and river networks.

	The Shandong Provincial Party Committee believes that this year's drought and flood prevention work must implement the policy of "focusing on flood prevention, giving equal importance to drought and flood prevention" and "focusing on storage, comprehensive arrangement, and comprehensive utilization" during the flood season. It is necessary to have countermeasures, preparations, and methods for all types of floods and possible droughts.

	Hunan Inspects Water Conservancy Projects to Ensure Flood Season Safety
	Hunan Province recently established a water conservancy inspection team and sent it to five prefectures, including Changde, Xiangtan, Shaoyang, Hengyang, and Chenzhou, and the banks of Dongting Lake to conduct a major water safety inspection. The inspection aims to further identify problems, establish and improve various systems, do a good job in flood prevention, and ensure that the lake area and the province's 169 larger water conservancy projects will not have problems during the flood season.

	Heilongjiang Launches a High Tide of Large Livestock Breeding
	Rural people's communes in Heilongjiang Province are seizing the peak estrus period of female animals in May to launch a high tide of large livestock breeding. The Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee regards May as a critical period for large livestock breeding and requires all localities not to miss the estrus period of any female animals and strive for full and accurate breeding. Various localities have adopted methods such as inspecting and setting deadlines for breeding, and have achieved great results in breeding suitable female animals. Baiquan County bred a total of 1,390 mares and cows from the 1st to the 10th, with an average of more than 130 mares and cows bred per day, an increase of 160% compared to the 50 mares and cows bred per day in late April.

	Xupu County Widely Plants High-Yield Feed - Banana Trees
	Recently, various pig farms in Xupu County, Hunan Province, have promoted high-yield feed - banana trees. Banana trees are a good feed with good nutrition, high yield, low labor input, and high returns. They have strong cold resistance and mostly grow in shady and humid places, making them suitable for planting in high and cold mountainous areas.

	The leaves, stems, and roots of banana trees can be used for pig feed. At the same time, one mother tree can produce more than 20 offspring trees, with a yield of more than 100,000 catties per mu. Calculating 3,000 catties of green feed required per pig per year, one mu of banana trees can feed more than 30 pigs for a year. At present, various pig farms in the county are widely using open spaces and mountain slopes to plant banana trees on a large scale.

    要闻快报
    山西组织麦收机械大协作
    山西晋南、晋中地区和太原郊区等主要产麦区实行收割机械大协作。
    麦收较迟的晋中地区和太原市抽调的一批联合收割机、摇臂收割机，组成一支机械化麦收协作大队，于5月下旬开赴季节较早的晋南地区支援麦收。晋南地区也决定麦收一完，立即组织联合收割机、摇臂收割机北上，支援晋中、太原地区的麦收。在麦收地区的县与县之间，也按照麦收季节的先后，在机械方面展开了对口支援，仅晋南专区各县参加对口支援的机械就有各种机械八百多台。这种相互之间的协作，对小麦快收快打提供了保证。
    山东及早部署防汛工作
    山东省在坚持抗旱斗争的同时，迅速做好一切防洪防涝准备，坚决战胜旱、涝灾害。今年山东防汛有着比以往更为复杂的情况和问题是，水利工程大量建成后，防汛范围大大扩大；新建的工程未经洪水考验；某些老工程的岁修完成的还不好；大搞园田化、河网化后，有些排水系统还不够健全。
    山东省委认为今年的抗旱防汛工作，在汛期必须贯彻“以防汛为主，抗旱防汛并重”和“以蓄为主，全面安排，综合利用”的方针，对各种类型的洪水和可能出现的干旱，都要作到有对策，有准备，有办法。
    湖南检查水利工程保证汛期安全
    湖南省最近成立了水利检查团，分赴常德、湘潭、邵阳、衡阳、郴州等五个专区和洞庭湖滨进行水利安全大检查，要求通过这次大检查，进一步发现问题，建立和健全各种制度，搞好防洪防汛工作，保证滨湖地区和全省一百六十九个较大的水利工程在汛期不出问题。
        黑龙江掀起大牲畜配种高潮
    黑龙江省农村各人民公社抓紧母畜发情旺盛期的5月份，掀起大牲畜配种高潮。中共黑龙江省委把5月份看作是大牲畜配种的关键时期，要求各地不让一头母畜错过发情期，力争全配全准。各地都采取边查边限期配种等方法，对适龄母畜进行配种，已取得很大成绩。拜泉县从1日到10日，共配母马母牛一千三百九十匹（头），平均日配一百三十多匹（头），较4月下旬日配五十匹（头）增加160％。
      溆浦县广种高产饲料——芭蕉树
    湖南省溆浦县各养猪场最近推广高产饲料——芭蕉树。芭蕉树是一种营养好、产量高、花工少、收益大的好饲料，它的耐寒能力较强，多生在荫蔽潮湿的地方，适宜高寒山区种植。
    芭蕉树的叶、茎、兜根都可以供猪食用，同时一兜母树可发二十余兜子树，亩产可达十万余斤，一头猪一年需要青饲料以三千斤计算，一亩芭蕉树可供三十多头猪吃一年。目前，这个县的各养猪场都广泛利用空坪隙地和山坡，大种芭蕉树。
