    "Children's Library" is Born
    To celebrate "June 1st" Children's Day, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Bao'an County, Guangdong, established a "Children's Library" for the Shuli Brigade of the Buji Commune.
    To prepare for the establishment of this children's library, the officers and soldiers of the unit made generous donations. Some soldiers donated their saved allowances, and the unit's leadership even sent people to Guangzhou to purchase a batch of children's books. Communist Youth League members and young soldiers also wrote letters of慰问 to the children, encouraging them to exercise well, study hard, and become successors to the builders and defenders of the motherland.
    Now, the first batch of over 300 books has been delivered to the children, and they have also personally helped to arrange and organize the library, deciding to officially open it on "June 1st" Children's Day.
    The news of the establishment of the "Children's Library" spread to the kindergartens and primary schools of the Shuli Brigade of the Buji Commune. Teachers, child care workers, and children are all very grateful, thanking the People's Liberation Army for their care and love for the children of the motherland. The children also expressed to the PLA uncles: "We will listen to our teachers, aunts, and parents, learn well from the PLA uncles, and become useful successors to the motherland!"

    “儿童图书馆”诞生了
    为了庆祝“六一”儿童节，驻广东宝安人民解放军某部，为布吉公社述力大队建立了一个“儿童图书馆”。
    为了筹建这个儿童图书馆，该部官兵们纷纷捐献。有的战士献出了自己节约下来的津贴费，部队的领导机关还专门派人到广州为儿童购买了一批儿童读物。共青团员和青年战士们，还给儿童们写了慰问信，鼓励他们好好锻炼身体，努力学习，做祖国建设和保卫者的接班人。
    现在，已经为儿童送来了第一批共三百余本图书，还亲自动手帮助布置和整理图书馆，决定在“六一”儿童节正式开放。
    建立“儿童图书馆”的消息传到布吉公社述力大队的幼儿园和小学校，老师、保育员和儿童们都十分感激，感谢解放军对祖国儿童的关怀和爱护。儿童们也纷纷向解放军叔叔表示：“要听老师、阿姨和父母的话，好好向解放军叔叔学习，做祖国有用的接班人！”
