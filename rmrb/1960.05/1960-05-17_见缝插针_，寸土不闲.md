	"Making Use of Every Crack," No Land Left Idle
	Commentator of this newspaper
	To fully utilize all available scattered and idle land to plant coarse grains, melons, vegetables, oil crops, and other crops is an important aspect of implementing the policy of simultaneous multiple harvests and high-yield multiple harvests. This spring, many regions have made great efforts in this regard. The early-planted coarse grains and melons and vegetables are currently growing well; some vegetables and feed have already begun to be harvested. This plays a significantly important role in improving people's lives and promoting the development of animal husbandry. Now, we should take advantage of the gaps between spring and summer planting and the management of large fields, and use the scattered and idle land that has not yet been fully utilized to launch another "making use of every crack" campaign, to make greater achievements in this regard, and to add greater strength to the high-speed development of agricultural production.
	"Making use of every crack" has two meanings: one is to make full use of time, and the other is to make full use of land. That is, "using bits and pieces of time to plant bits and pieces of land," "seizing every second and making use of every inch of land." How can we achieve these two points? Comrades in some areas have already made good summaries, which is the saying "sharp eyes and quick hands."
	People easily overlook scattered pieces of land. Some places still haven't utilized these scattered pieces of land because people there think "a palm-sized piece of land isn't worth much." Some places have utilized these scattered pieces of land relatively fully because people there have done some calculations and their eyes have brightened. The comrades of the Jinfeng Commune in Xinning, Hunan, have calculated the following: The scattered and idle land in each team of the commune adds up to 13,000 mu, which is quite a lot. Using 10,000 mu to plant coarse grains, with a yield of 100 jin per mu, could yield an extra 1 million jin of grain, enough for 2,000 people to eat for a year. Using idle land to plant vegetables, feed, etc., and freeing up land to plant grain crops, can also increase grain production a lot. Using a portion of the coarse grains produced on idle land as refined feed, plus the green fodder grown on other idle land, can raise 10,000 pigs. With bright eyes, the energy comes; they not only achieved "planting wherever there is soil, green everywhere," but also carefully managed and universally fertilized them. By the end of April, Hunan Province had already used 4 million mu of idle land to plant various crops, increasing the amount of grain or vegetable land per person by one fen, and increasing the amount of grain per person by dozens of jin or vegetables by hundreds of jin. The "worth" is very great!
	Not only can idle land be fully utilized, but climbing crops can also be planted in large quantities to develop upwards and make fuller use of space. The people's communes in Qiaojia County, Yunnan, have adapted to local conditions and planted large quantities of pumpkins on mountains, slopes, depressions, ditches, bays, embankments, and tops, aiming to achieve "no cracks on stone ridges, no ridges on slopes, no tiles on roofs, and green everywhere in ditches and embankments." By mid-April, the county had planted nearly 40 million pumpkin seedlings, an average of about 160 seedlings per person; assuming an average yield of 50 jin per seedling, the total yield could reach 2 billion jin. Building bean and melon trellises on well platforms and riverbanks can not only increase the harvest of melons and beans, but also beautify the environment; building bean and melon trellises on canals can also reduce water evaporation.
	Not only should we "make use of every crack" on idle land; we can also find many "cracks" in the large fields. If the row spacing is too wide or there are missing seedlings or broken rows, and there is no time to replant the same crop, other crops can be interplanted. In the spirit of "making use of every crack," every place can expand the area of intercropping and relay cropping. The Guojia Village Production Team of the Lincheng Commune in Qufu, Shandong, actively promoted the method of two, three, or four crops a year, treating 1,800 mu of land as more than 3,000 mu of land, and greatly expanding the area of various crops. They have many methods. First, plant small white cabbage, then interplant pumpkins in the cabbage field after a month, harvest the small white cabbage and then interplant corn in the pumpkin field, and after harvesting the pumpkins and corn, plant large white cabbage again, and then interplant wheat in the cabbage field, is one of the methods. They strictly control the sowing period of various crops, select short-growing and early-maturing varieties, and ensure the combination of tall-stem crops and short-stem crops, the combination of gramineous crops and leguminous, vine, or tuber crops, the combination of crops with strong light requirements and crops with weak light requirements, and the combination of summer-harvested crops and autumn-harvested crops, so that various crops not only do not hinder each other, but also can complement each other's strengths and increase production for mutual benefit. Will planting all the scattered land and empty land distract energy? Will it make the labor force feel even more insufficient? Will it hinder large-field production? This depends on whether we can achieve "quick hands." In agricultural production activities, there will always be scattered empty time; as long as it is arranged well, organized well, and used well, and we act at the right time, we can completely manage to cultivate large fields without neglecting the bits and pieces of land. We must coordinate the overall situation and incorporate large-field production and production on scattered land into the production team's plan as much as possible, and on the premise of actively innovating technology, reforming tools, and accumulating more fertilizer, make careful calculations and reasonable allocations of time, manpower, and fertilizer. The experience of many places proves that in places with more scattered land, as long as the seeds, fertilizers, etc. are prepared in advance, and a portion of the labor force is drawn to attack for one or two afternoons, the scattered land of a team can be basically planted. It can also be assigned to small teams and work groups to be responsible for, and each can use scattered time to plant; some scattered land can be planted while cultivating large fields. As for regular cultivation and management, it can be assigned to a small number of semi-laborers, public canteen staff, or livestock farm staff for special management, or it can be allocated to various production teams depending on the situation.
	When conducting agricultural production inspections and comparisons, all regions and communes should include the utilization of scattered and idle land as an inspection item. Only by utilizing every piece of existing cultivated land, newly reclaimed land, and scattered land to increase production and achieve a bumper harvest can we obtain a truly comprehensive and great bumper harvest.

    “见缝插针”，寸土不闲  
    本报评论员
    充分利用一切可以利用的零星闲散土地种植杂粮、瓜菜、油料等等作物，是执行多种多收和高产多收同时并举的方针的一个重要方面。今年春天，很多地区在这方面作了很大的努力。种得早的杂粮、瓜菜，目前长得很好；有些蔬菜、饲料，已经开始采摘。这对于改善人民生活和促进畜牧业的发展，具有相当重要的作用。现在，应该利用春播夏播和大田管理的间隙，利用至今尚未充分利用的零星闲散土地，再开展一个“见缝插针”运动，在这方面做出更大的成绩来，为高速度发展农业生产添加更大的力量。
      “见缝插针”有两个意义：一是充分利用时间，一是充分利用土地。也就是“用零零星星的时间，种零零星星的土地”，“分秒必争，寸土不闲”。怎样才能做到这两点呢？有些地区的同志已经做了很好的总结，这就是俗话说的“眼明手快”。
    人们很容易忽视零零星星的土地。有些地方的零星土地至今还没有利用，就因为那里的人们认为“巴掌大的地，没多大油水”。有些地方的零星土地已经比较充分地利用，就因为那里的人们算过几笔账，眼睛明亮了。湖南新宁金峰公社的同志们算了这样几笔账：全社各队的零星闲散土地，加起来有一万三千亩，很不少。用一万亩种杂粮，亩产一百斤，就能多收一百万斤粮食，足够二千人吃一年。用闲散土地种蔬菜、饲料等等，腾出地来种粮食作物，也可以增产很多粮食。用闲散地上增产的一部分杂粮做精饲料，加上别的闲散地上种的青饲料，能养一万头猪。眼明了，劲就来了；他们不但做到了“见土就种，遍地皆青”，并且对它们精心管理，普遍追肥。到4月下旬为止，湖南全省已经利用闲散土地种植各种作物四百万亩，平均每人增加了一分粮地或菜地，每人可以增加几十斤粮或几百斤菜。“油水”大得很！
    不但闲散地面可以充分利用，还可以大种攀缘作物，向高处发展，更充分地利用空间。云南巧家县各人民公社因地制宜大种南瓜山、南瓜坡、南瓜凹、南瓜沟、南瓜湾、南瓜埝、南瓜顶，要做到“石埂不见缝，坡地不见埂，屋顶不见瓦，沟埝处处青”。到4月中旬，全县种了近四千万窝南瓜，平均每人大约一百六十窝；以平均一窝产瓜五十斤计算，总共可产瓜二十亿斤。在井台上、河边上搭上豆棚瓜架，不但可以多收瓜豆，还可以美化环境；在渠道上搭上豆棚瓜架，还可以减少水分蒸发。
    不只是在闲散土地上要“见缝插针”；在大田上也可以找到许多“缝”。行距太宽的，缺苗断条的，如果来不及补种同种作物，都可以补种别的作物。本着“见缝插针”的精神，每个地方都可以扩大间作和套种的面积。山东曲阜陵城公社郭家村生产队积极推行一年两熟、三熟、四熟的办法，把一千八百多亩地当三千多亩地种，各种作物的面积都扩大了很多。他们的办法多得很。先种小白菜，过一个月在菜地里间作南瓜，收了小白菜再在瓜地里间作玉米，收了南瓜、玉米后又种大白菜，然后又在白菜地里套种小麦，就是办法之一。他们严格掌握各种作物的播种期，选用生长期短和早熟的品种，并且作到高秆作物和低秆作物配合，禾本科作物和豆科、蔓生或块根作物配合，需光强的作物和需光弱的作物配合，夏收作物和秋收作物配合，不但使各种作物不互相妨碍，而且能够以长补短，互利增产。把零星土地、空隙土地都种上，会不会分散精力？会不会使劳动力更感不足？会不会妨碍大田生产？这就要看能不能做到“手快”。在农业生产活动中，零星的空隙时间总是会有的；只要安排得好，组织得好，运用得好，瞅准时机就干，完全可以做到既不误大田耕作又把零星隙地种好管好。要统筹全局，尽可能把大田生产和零星土地上的生产都纳入生产队的规划，在积极革新技术、改革工具、多积肥料的前提下，把时间、人力、肥料等作精细的计算和合理的调配。许多地方的经验证明，在零星地较多的地方，只要事先把种子、肥料等准备好，用一两个下午的时间，抽一部分劳动力突击一下，就可以把一个队的零星地基本上种完。也可以分给小队、作业组负责，各自运用零星的时间去种；有些零星土地在种大田的时候捎带一下就可以种好。至于经常的培育管理，可以分别不同情况交给少数半劳动力、公共食堂人员或畜牧场人员专管，或者搭配到各个生产小队。
    各地区各公社在进行农业生产大检查大评比的时候，都应该把零星闲散土地的利用作为一个检查项目。只有把原有耕地、新垦土地、零星土地，每一片每一块都利用起来，实现增产，大丰收，才能够获得真正全面的大丰收。
