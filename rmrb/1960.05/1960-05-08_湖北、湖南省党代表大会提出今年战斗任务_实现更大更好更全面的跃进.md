    Hubei, Hunan Provincial Party Congresses Propose This Year's Combat Tasks
    Achieve a Greater, Better, and More Comprehensive Leap Forward

    This newspaper reports: Holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, further unleashing the power of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, and building upon the continuous leap forward of the past two years, we must advance victoriously and strive for a continued greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in the national economy. This is the battle cry issued by the Second Congress of the Communist Party of China in Hubei Province to all Party organizations and the people of the province.

    The Second Congress of the Communist Party of China in Hubei Province was held from April 11th to 17th. The meeting heard the report "Hold High the Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought and March from Victory to Victory" made by Wang Renzhong, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, on behalf of the previous Provincial Party Committee, discussed and adopted the "Forty Articles of the Hubei Provincial Economic Work Outline (Draft)," and the resolution of the Congress, and elected a new Provincial Committee.

    The Congress noted with satisfaction that since the First Congress in 1956, the development of the national economy in Hubei Province, like that of the whole country, has achieved continuous great leaps forward year after year, with both high speed and proportional development. In 1959, the total industrial and agricultural output value of the province increased by 27.6% compared with 1958. Driven by the double leap forward in industry and agriculture, the province's transportation, finance and trade, science, culture, and education have also developed rapidly. Currently, the mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution is flourishing throughout the province. As of the end of March this year, the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization of industrial enterprises above the county level in the province has increased from 38.62% at the end of last year to 57.36%. 31,808 manual operations have been mechanized or semi-mechanized, with 4,057 automated single machines and 345 automated production lines. The province has overfulfilled its first quarter production tasks ahead of schedule, and 311 enterprises have emerged that "replace several factories, increase production and save manpower." The rural people's communes have embarked on the road of sound development. Cities, in comprehensively organizing the people's economic life, have vigorously established street industries, public canteens, nurseries, neighborhood service stations, and other collective welfare undertakings, promoting the socialization of housework, enabling thousands of urban housewives to break away from tedious housework and participate in production, and profoundly changing the face of the cities.

    In the face of this excellent situation, the Congress called on all Party organizations and the people of the province to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward on the basis of the continuous leap forward of the past two years. The arrangement of the 1960 national economic plan determines that agriculture is the foundation and industry is the leading factor, so that the priority development of heavy industry and the rapid development of agriculture are combined; continue to implement the policy of taking steel as the key link in industry and grain as the key link in agriculture, and making comprehensive arrangements; and further strengthen the transportation industry, power industry, mining industry and other departments, and more appropriately handle the relationship between heavy industry, light industry, and agriculture.

    The meeting believed that agricultural production in Hubei Province has made great progress in recent years, but the serious disasters in 1959 brought some difficulties to the development of agricultural production. Therefore, accelerating the development of agriculture is of more urgent significance to Hubei Province. The Congress decided to continue to use its main strength to grasp agriculture in the next few years. Under the premise of ensuring increased grain production, comprehensively arrange the production of various crops such as grain, cotton, oil, hemp, silk, tea, sugar, vegetables, tobacco, fruits, medicine, and miscellaneous crops, and implement agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries simultaneously. In order to adapt to the development of agricultural production, the meeting proposed that it is necessary to accelerate the technical transformation of agriculture and vigorously grasp the reform of tools, requiring that most areas of the province can basically achieve "four reforms and two eliminations" before 1962. That is, change manual irrigation and drainage to gravity irrigation and mechanical irrigation and drainage, change carrying on shoulders and backs to vehicle and boat transportation, change old-fashioned farm tools to new-style farm tools, and change manual processing of agricultural and sideline products to mechanical and semi-mechanical processing, eliminate carrying on shoulders, and eliminate manual water lifting. Gradually arm agriculture on the basis of modern technology and greatly increase agricultural labor productivity. Vigorously grasp fertilizer accumulation and vigorously develop animal husbandry with pig raising as the head, and strive to gradually realize that the province averages one pig per person and one pig per mu of land. At the same time, it is also necessary to vigorously develop diversified operations, vigorously grasp the processing and comprehensive utilization of agricultural products to increase the income of commune members.

    In order to realize the agricultural leap forward plan this year, the meeting called on all sectors of the national economy in the province: industry, transportation, culture and education, finance and trade, and other aspects must do everything possible to support agriculture and launch a vigorous mass movement of all walks of life to support agriculture.

    The tasks of the province's industrial and transportation fronts in 1960 are: to carry out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization in depth, to strictly practice increasing production and practicing economy, to vigorously support agriculture, and to strive for the realization of "three reds" (red start, all-round red, and red to the end) and "five bumper harvests" (ideology, production, life, study, and hygiene) to catch up with the advanced level of the country. In order to better support agriculture and create material conditions for the early realization of agricultural mechanization, the industrial front must further expand the heavy industrial base and adhere to the policy of taking steel as the key link and making an all-round leap forward. Coal, iron and steel, wood, and transportation are the weak links in the province's industry. It is necessary to adopt the method of vigorously launching mass movements to accelerate the development of construction and production in these areas. In particular, accelerate the geological exploration and mine construction of coal. In all places where conditions permit, actively adopt the methods of small indigenous groups or small foreign groups to build a batch of coal mining, iron smelting, and steelmaking industries. While actively developing, it is also necessary to accelerate the technical transformation of existing small blast furnaces and greatly improve the utilization coefficient. In order to adapt to the vigorous development of coal and iron, it is also necessary to build some small foreign railways or small indigenous railways.

    Actively developing science, culture, and education, accelerating the training of talents, and rapidly establishing a large contingent of working-class intellectuals are not only the tasks of the cultural and educational front, but also the tasks of the entire Party and the entire people.

    The meeting believed that the current task of the rural people's communes is to further carry out rectification and construction work politically, ideologically, economically, and organizationally. The conditions for vigorously establishing urban people's communes are ripe, and it is necessary to adopt a positive attitude, strengthen leadership, proceed from the actual situation, and quickly realize the communization of cities in a planned and step-by-step manner.

    The meeting believed that the most fundamental key to better achieving the above tasks lies in seriously studying Mao Zedong's works and improving theoretical level. The meeting particularly emphasized that all Party cadres in the province must adhere to the working method of the mass line. This newspaper reports: The Second Congress of the Communist Party of China in Hunan Province was held in Changsha from March 12th to 27th. This Congress summarized the brilliant achievements and basic experiences of the past three years since the First Provincial Party Congress, formulated a preliminary blueprint for socialist construction in the next three years, earnestly and conscientiously discussed the current work, and elected members and alternate members of the Second Committee of the Communist Party of China in Hunan Province.

    Zhang Pinghua, First Secretary of the Hunan Provincial Party Committee, made a report to the Congress on behalf of the Provincial Party Committee entitled "Leaping Forward at High Speed Under the Brilliant Illumination of Mao Zedong Thought." After discussion, the Congress unanimously agreed with this report and made a resolution. The resolution believes that since the Party Congress in 1956, the Provincial Party Committee and Party committees at all levels have correctly implemented the central line and policies and led the people of the province to successfully realize the people's communization of rural areas and the two consecutive great leaps forward in industrial and agricultural production and construction. The Congress called on all Party comrades to hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and strive to successfully complete the tasks of 1960 and realize the continued leap forward in the next three years on the basis of the two great leaps forward.

    The Congress analyzed the current excellent situation in which the province's construction undertakings have continued to leap forward. The province's production movement centered on spring harvest and spring plowing is flourishing; the production increase and economy movement centered on technical innovation and technical revolution is also developing into a more widespread and deeper stage.

    The Congress pointed out that the current three-level ownership system based on the team in the province's rural people's communes is adapted to the current level of production development. The current task is to give full play to its superiority, actively develop the entire commune economy, and at the same time actively create conditions for the gradual transition from the basic ownership of the brigade to the basic ownership of the commune.

    The Congress particularly emphasized that in the process of socialist construction, it is necessary to adhere to the principle of building the country diligently and frugally, running communes diligently and frugally, running all undertakings diligently and frugally, and managing households diligently and frugally. Party committees at all levels must grasp production with one hand and life with the other. While leading production, they must also run the collective life and welfare undertakings of the people's communes and further arrange the people's lives well.

    The Congress discussed and approved in principle the Hunan Provincial National Economic Construction and Development Outline (Draft) for 1960-1962 and the tasks for 1960. According to the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, industry as the leading factor, and the all-round leap forward of workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, the Congress determined that the basic tasks of socialist construction in Hunan Province in the next three years are: to better implement the Party's general line for socialist construction, to realize the high-speed leap forward of the national economy on the basis of the two consecutive great leaps forward, and to further change the face of the province.

    The Congress believes that, according to the situation in Hunan Province, the central link in how to highlight the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation is to develop grain and pig production. While vigorously grasping grain production, it is also necessary to vigorously grasp the production of cotton, oil, hemp, silk, tea, sugar, vegetables, tobacco, fruits, medicine, and miscellaneous crops. Animal husbandry must be placed in a position of equal importance with crop cultivation. Another important policy of agricultural production is to implement the simultaneous implementation of increasing yield per unit area and expanding cultivated land area. The current priority is to make full use of existing cultivated land and strive in the direction of "no idle land"; further implement the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture, increase the multiple cropping index, and increase yield per unit area as much as possible; at the same time, it is necessary to actively expand the cultivated land area, vigorously reclaim wasteland with the same energy as large-scale water conservancy construction, and combine mountain management, water management, and soil management well, and strive to basically complete the task of reclaiming 30 million mu of wasteland this winter and next spring. In terms of accelerating the technical transformation of agriculture, this year's main tasks are to vigorously carry out tool reform, vigorously carry out semi-mechanization, and vigorously use water energy. The current focus should be on improving agricultural tools and semi-mechanization. On the basis of popularizing semi-mechanization, gradually increase the degree of mechanization.

    The Congress believes that the fundamental key to ensuring that agricultural production can continue to leap forward at high speed in the future lies in equipping agriculture with advanced technology and realizing the modernization of agriculture. The Congress determined that the primary task of the industrial front is to accelerate the technical transformation of agriculture and basically realize the universal semi-mechanization and partial mechanization of agriculture within three years. The Congress prominently emphasized that the whole people should vigorously run industry, counties and communes should vigorously run industry, and all people's communes that have the conditions to run industries such as iron and steel, coal, cement, chemical fertilizers, and machinery should vigorously run them.

    The Congress specifically discussed the issues of caring for the masses' lives and paying attention to working methods. According to the fact that more than 99% of the rural population in the province participates in public canteens, the central link in caring for the masses' lives is to run various collective life and welfare undertakings centered on canteens well.

    The Congress believes that culture, education, sports, medical and health care, militia construction, and political and legal work must all actively strengthen and catch up in order to adapt to the development of the situation.

    The Congress emphasized that it is necessary to constantly consolidate and develop the Party's organization and strengthen the Party's ideological construction. Party committees at all levels must constantly improve their leadership methods, and all cadres must conscientiously study Mao Zedong's works.

    湖北、湖南省党代表大会提出今年战斗任务
    实现更大更好更全面的跃进
    本报讯　高举毛泽东思想的红旗，更进一步地发挥总路线、大跃进、人民公社的威力，在过去两年连续跃进的基础上，乘胜前进，争取国民经济继续更大更好更全面的跃进。这是中共湖北省第二届代表大会向全省党组织及全省人民提出的战斗号召。
    中共湖北省第二届代表大会于4月11日至17日举行。会议听取了省委第一书记王任重代表前届省委所作的“高举毛泽东思想的红旗，从胜利走向胜利”的报告，讨论通过了“湖北省经济工作纲要四十条（草案）”和大会的决议，选出新的省委员会。
    大会满意地指出，从1956年第一届代表大会以来，湖北省国民经济的发展和全国一样，连年取得了既高速度又按比例的持续大跃进。1959年全省工农业总产值比1958年增长27.6％。在工农业双跃进的带动下，全省交通运输、财经贸易、科学文教等工作也都有了迅速的发展。当前全省技术革新和技术革命的群众运动蓬勃发展。到今年3月底止，全省县以上工业企业的机械化半机械化程度，已由去年年底的38.62％提高到57.36％，有三万一千八百零八项手工操作实现了机械化半机械化，出现了自动化单机四千零五十七台，自动化生产线三百四十五条。全省提前超额完成首季生产任务，并出现了“一厂顶数厂，增产又节人”的企业三百一十一个。农村人民公社已经走上了健全发展的道路。城市在全面组织人民经济生活中，大办街道工业、大办公共食堂、托儿所、邻
  里服务站等集体福利事业，促进了家务劳动社会化，使千千万万的城市家庭妇女摆脱了繁琐的家务劳动，参加了生产，使城市面貌发生了深刻的变化。
    在这个大好形势面前，大会号召全省党组织和全省人民，在过去两年连续跃进的基础上，实现更大更好更全面的跃进。1960年国民经济计划的安排，确定以农业为基础，以工业为主导，使优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业互相结合；继续执行工业以钢为纲，农业以粮为纲、全面安排的方针，并且进一步加强运输业、动力工业、采掘工业等部门，更加适当地处理重工业、轻工业、农业各部门之间的关系。
    会议认为，几年来，湖北省农业生产有了很大发展，但是1959年的严重灾害，给农业生产的发展带来了一些困难，因此，加速发展农业，对湖北省来说更具有迫切的意义。大会决定在今后若干年内仍然用主要力量抓农业，在保证粮食增产的条件下，全面安排粮、棉、油、麻、丝、茶、糖、菜、烟、果、药、杂各类农作物的生产，实行农、林、牧、副、渔同时并举。为了适应农业生产的发展，会议提出必须加速农业技术改造，大抓工具改革，要求全省大部分地区能在1962年以前基本上实现“四改两消灭”。这就是改人力排灌为自流灌溉和机械排灌，改肩挑背驮为车船运输，改旧式农具为新式农具，改农副业产品的人力加工为机械、半机械加工，消灭肩挑，消灭人力车水。逐步地使农业在现代技术的基础上武装起来，大大提高农业的劳动生产率。要大抓积肥，大力发展以养猪为首的畜牧事业，争取逐步实现全省平均每人养一头猪，到每亩地养一头猪。同时还要大力发展多种经营，大抓农产品的加工和综合利用，以增加社员收入。
    为了实现今年农业跃进计划，会议号召全省国民经济各个部门：工业、交通、文教、财贸等各方面都要千方百计地支援农业，掀起一个轰轰烈烈的各行各业支援农业的群众运动。
    1960年全省工业和交通运输战线的任务是：深入开展以机械化、半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，厉行增产节约，大力支援农业，为实现“三红”（开门红、满堂红、红到底）“五丰收”（思想、生产、生活、学习、卫生）向全国先进水平看齐而奋勇前进。为了更好地支援农业，为早日实现农业机械化创造物质条件，工业战线必须进一步扩大重工业基础，坚持以钢为纲，全面跃进的方针。煤炭、钢铁、木材、交通运输是本省工业的薄弱环节，必须采取大搞群众运动的办法，加速发展这方面的建设和生产。特别是加速煤炭的地质勘探和矿井建设。在一切有条件的地方，积极采用小土群或小洋群的办法，建设一批采煤和炼铁炼钢的工业。在积极发展的同时，要加速现有小高炉的技术改造，大大提高利用系数。为了适应大办煤铁，还要建设一些小洋铁路或小土铁路。
    积极发展科学文教事业，加快培养人材，迅速建立一支宏大的工人阶级知识分子的队伍，不仅是文教战线的任务，也是全党全民的任务。
    会议认为，农村人民公社现在的任务是进一步从政治思想上、经济上、组织上进行整顿和建设工作。大办城市人民公社的条件已经成熟，必须采取积极态度，加强领导，从实际情况出发，有计划有步骤地迅速实现城市人民公社化。
    会议认为，要更好地实现上述任务，最根本的关键在于认真学习毛泽东著作，提高理论水平。会议特别强调了全省党的干部都要坚持群众路线的工作方法。本报讯　中国共产党湖南省第二次代表大会从3月12日到27日在长沙市举行。这次代表大会总结了第一次全省党代表大会以来三年多的辉煌成就和基本经验，制订了今后三年社会主义建设的初步蓝图，切实认真地讨论了当前的工作，并选举了中共湖南省第二届委员会的委员和候补委员。
    中共湖南省委第一书记张平化同志代表省委向大会作了“在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下高速度跃进”的报告。大会经过讨论，一致同意这个报告。并作出决议。决议认为：自1956年党的代表大会以来，省委和各级党委正确地执行了中央的路线、政策，领导全省人民顺利地实现了农村的人民公社化和工农业生产建设的两年连续大跃进。大会号召全党同志，在两年大跃进的基础上，高举毛泽东思想的红旗，为胜利完成1960年的各项任务和实现今后三年的继续跃进而奋斗。
    大会分析了目前全省已出现的建设事业不断跃进的大好形势。全省以春收春耕为中心的生产运动，正在蓬勃开展；以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动，也正在向一个更普遍、更深入的阶段发展。
    大会指出：目前全省农村人民公社以队为基础的三级所有制，是适应目前生产发展水平的，当前的任务是：充分发挥它的优越性，积极发展整个公社经济，同时还要为大队基本所有制逐步过渡到公社基本所有制积极创造过渡的条件。
    大会特别强调：在社会主义建设过程中，一定要坚持勤俭建国、勤俭办社、勤俭办一切事业、勤俭持家的原则，各级党委必须一手抓生产，一手抓生活，在领导生产的同时，还要办好人民公社的集体生活福利事业，进一步安排好人民生活。
    大会讨论和原则上批准了湖南省1960—1962年国民经济建设发展纲要（草案）和1960年的任务，根据以农业为基础、以工业为主导、工农商学兵全面跃进的方针，大会确定湖南省今后三年内社会主义建设的基本任务是：更好地贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线，在两年连续大跃进的基础上，实现国民经济高速度地跃进，进一步改变全省面貌。
    大会认为，根据湖南省的情况，如何突出以农业为基础的方针，中心环节是发展粮食和生猪生产。在大抓粮食生产的同时，还要大力抓好棉、油、麻、丝、茶、糖、菜、烟、果、药、杂的生产，必须把畜牧业放在与种植业同等重要的地位。农业生产的另一个重要方针，是贯彻执行提高单位面积产量和扩大耕地面积同时并举。当前首要的是充分利用现有耕地，向“寸土不闲”的方向努力；进一步贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”，提高复种指数，尽一切可能提高单位面积产量；同时，必须积极扩大耕地面积，以大搞水利建设一样的劲头来大力开荒，把治山、治水、治土很好地结合起来，力争在今冬明春基本上完成开荒三千万亩的任务。在加速农业技术改造方面，今年主要是大搞工具改革，大搞半机械化，大搞水能利用。当前应当是以改良农具和半机械化为主。在普及半机械化的基础上，逐步提高机械化的程度。
    大会认为，要使农业生产在今后能持续不断地高速度跃进，根本关键还在于用先进的技术来装备农业，实现农业的现代化。大会确定：工业战线的首要任务，是加速农业技术改造，三年内基本上普遍实现农业半机械化和部分机械化。大会突出强调了全民大办工业，县社大办工业，所有的人民公社，凡是有条件举办钢铁、煤炭、水泥、化肥、机械等工业的，都要大办。
    大会专门讨论了关心群众生活、注意工作方法问题。根据全省99％以上的农村人口参加公共食堂的情况，关心群众生活的中心环节，是办好以食堂为中心的各项集体生活福利事业。
    大会认为：文化、教育、体育、医疗卫生、民兵建设和政法工作等，都必须适应形势的发展，积极加强，迎头赶上。
    大会着重指出：必须不断地巩固和发展壮大党的组织，加强党的思想建设。各级党委要不断改进领导方法，全体干部一定要认真地学习毛泽东著作。
