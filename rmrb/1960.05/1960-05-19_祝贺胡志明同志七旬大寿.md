    Congratulating Comrade Ho Chi Minh on His Seventieth Birthday
    Lin Boqu
    Today is the seventieth birthday of Comrade Ho Chi Minh, Chairman of the Vietnam Workers' Party and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The Chinese people, with excitement and lofty respect, join the Vietnamese people in warmly celebrating the birthday of our closest friend, Comrade Ho Chi Minh.
    Comrade Ho Chi Minh is the loyal son of the Vietnamese working class, the wise leader sincerely loved by the Vietnam Workers' Party and the various ethnic groups of Vietnam, and an outstanding activist in the international communist movement. His revolutionary struggle is a shining example of a great revolutionary dedicating himself to the cause of independence, liberation, and unification of his motherland, dedicating himself to the liberation of the proletariat and oppressed nations, and actively striving for the victory of socialism and communism and for world peace. We are filled with infinite admiration for his unwavering revolutionary will and fighting spirit in resolutely opposing imperialism and class enemies for decades.
    Comrade Ho Chi Minh's decades of revolutionary activities reflect a great era in Vietnamese history. In this era, the hardworking and brave Vietnamese people, under the invincible banner of Marxism-Leninism and under the leadership of the Vietnamese proletarian party, have stood tall and carried out persistent revolutionary struggles, moving from one victory to another. Now, in North Vietnam, the rule of imperialism and feudalism has been completely overthrown, and a vigorous socialist revolution and socialist construction are being carried out. The Vietnamese people are continuing to fight for the realization of national unity throughout Vietnam, for the establishment of a peaceful, democratic, unified, independent, and prosperous Vietnam.
    Comrade Ho Chi Minh is the founder of the Vietnamese proletarian party. After the French imperialists occupied Vietnam in 1862, the Vietnamese people continuously rose up to resist the oppression and enslavement of the French colonialists. However, because there was no leadership from the Communist Party, various national salvation activities failed one after another. In his youth, Comrade Ho Chi Minh saw the plight of his country and resolved to dedicate himself to the revolutionary cause of national independence. He left his hometown to find a way to save the country and the people. After the First World War, he finally found Marxism-Leninism, realizing that only it could liberate the oppressed nations and all working people of the world from slavery. It was Comrade Ho Chi Minh who first spread Marxism-Leninism to the Vietnamese people and, in 1930, created Vietnam's proletarian party, bringing the Vietnamese revolution into a new stage—the stage where the proletariat began to lead the revolution.
    Comrade Ho Chi Minh is a fearless fighter against imperialism. He held high the banner of national democratic revolution and led the Vietnamese people in a long-term, heroic revolutionary struggle against French and Japanese imperialism. The revolutionary forces of the Vietnamese people, in the flames of the anti-imperialist struggle, constantly grew stronger through arduous and tortuous paths. On August 19, 1945, under the direct leadership of the Party and Comrade Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese people launched the August Revolution, shattering the shackles of colonialism that had lasted for nearly a century, overthrowing the thousands-year-old monarchy in Vietnam, and victoriously establishing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, where the people are the masters of their own country. This was the first time in Southeast Asia that a colony, led by a proletarian party, seized power through armed uprising and established a nation with national independence. Therefore, this victory has great international significance.
    The imperialists were unwilling to accept the great victory of the Vietnamese people in winning independence. Shortly after the birth of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the French colonialists, with the support of US and British imperialism, launched a war of aggression against the Vietnamese people, attempting to stage a comeback and re-enslave the Vietnamese people. Under the leadership of the Party and Comrade Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese people bravely and tenaciously waged a nine-year long-term resistance war, inflicting extremely heavy blows on the French aggressors and crushing the conspiracy of the American interventionists to expand the Indochina War. The just struggle of the Vietnamese people received the firm support of the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries, as well as peace-loving people all over the world, and finally reached the Geneva Accords in July 1954, restoring peace in Indochina and making a significant contribution to the cause of peace in Asia and the world.
    Comrade Ho Chi Minh is a wise leader of Vietnam's socialist revolution and socialist construction. After the restoration of peace, under the leadership of the Party and Comrade Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese people, on the basis of completing land reform and restoring the national economy, actively carried out socialist transformation and socialist construction in the North, achieving a series of major achievements, greatly enhancing the awareness of the Vietnamese people, and changing the face of North Vietnam with each passing day. Now, the Vietnamese people are waging a victorious struggle to complete the socialist transformation and develop the economic and cultural three-year plan (1958-1960).
    At the same time, in South Vietnam, US imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique have done everything possible to undermine the Geneva Accords, attempting to divide Vietnam for a long time and turn the South into a colony and military base of US imperialism. Under the leadership of the Party and Comrade Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese people are continuing to fight for the unification of their motherland.
    Comrade Ho Chi Minh is an outstanding proletarian internationalist. He has always been committed to safeguarding and strengthening the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, safeguarding and strengthening the unity of the international communist movement, and safeguarding and strengthening the unity of peace-loving and progressive people all over the world. He is very concerned about, sympathizes with, and supports the liberation struggles of the oppressed nations in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The victory of the Vietnamese revolution led by him is a great inspiration to the oppressed nations all over the world.
    Comrade Ho Chi Minh has a particularly deep friendship with the Chinese people. In the difficult years when the revolutions of our two countries had not yet achieved victory, Comrade Ho Chi Minh had worked with our people in many places in China, sharing weal and woe. Therefore, the Chinese people also have a particularly close feeling for Comrade Ho Chi Minh and the Vietnamese people. Vietnam and China are fraternal neighbors, and the people of the two countries are close comrades-in-arms. We have always given each other deep sympathy and support in the struggle for national liberation; in the current struggle against our common enemy, US imperialism, and in the cause of socialist construction, we further support and encourage each other, cooperate closely, and advance together. In recent years, Comrade Ho Chi Minh has visited our country several times, further deepening this friendship and solidarity between the Chinese and Vietnamese people. As Comrade Ho Chi Minh recently said, "Our two parties are brothers, our two governments are brothers, and our two peoples are brothers in the socialist family headed by the great Soviet Union. Our unity is unbreakable."
    Love for the motherland, love for the people, close ties with the masses, and a humble and simple style are very prominent virtues of Comrade Ho Chi Minh. Whether in the past years of arduous struggle or in the current peaceful environment of leading the country's construction, Comrade Ho Chi Minh has always set an outstanding example in these aspects. The Chinese people deeply admire this.
    Today, on the occasion of Comrade Ho Chi Minh's seventieth birthday, the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people feel very happy, just like the Vietnam Workers' Party and the Vietnamese people. We wholeheartedly congratulate Comrade Ho Chi Minh on his eternal youth and longevity; we congratulate the Vietnamese people on achieving new and greater victories in the cause of socialist construction, in the unification of their motherland, and in the just struggle against US imperialism under the leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party and its leader, President Ho Chi Minh.

    祝贺胡志明同志七旬大寿
    林伯渠
    今天，是越南劳动党和越南民主共和国主席胡志明同志的七旬大庆。中国人民怀着兴奋的心情和崇高的敬意，同越南人民一道，热烈庆祝我们最亲密的朋友——胡志明同志的寿辰。
    胡志明同志是越南工人阶级的忠实儿子、越南劳动党和越南各族人民衷心爱戴的英明领袖、国际共产主义运动杰出的活动家。他的革命斗争经历，是一个伟大革命家献身于祖国的独立、解放和统一事业，献身于无产阶级和被压迫民族的解放事业，积极为社会主义和共产主义的胜利以及世界和平而奋斗的光辉榜样。他数十年如一日，坚决反对帝国主义和阶级敌人的不屈不挠的革命意志和战斗精神，使我们感到无限钦佩。
    胡志明同志几十年的革命活动，反映了越南历史上的一个伟大的时代。在这个时代里，勤劳勇敢的越南人民，在马克思列宁主义的战无不胜的旗帜下，在越南无产阶级政党的领导下，昂然地站立起来，进行坚持不懈的革命斗争，从一个胜利走到一个胜利。现在在越南北方，已经彻底推翻了帝国主义和封建主义的统治，轰轰烈烈地开展着社会主义革命和社会主义建设。越南人民正在为实现全越南的国家统一，为建立一个和平、民主、统一、独立和富强的越南而继续奋斗。
    胡志明同志是越南无产阶级政党的创立者。在1862年法帝国主义侵占越南以后，越南人民就不断地起来反抗法国殖民主义者的压迫和奴役。但是，因为没有共产党的领导，各种救国活动都相继失败了。胡志明同志在青年时代，看到了亡国的情景，决心献身于民族独立的革命事业。他离开家乡去找寻救国救民的道路。在第一次世界大战以后，他终于找到了马克思列宁主义，认识到只有它才能够把世界上的被压迫民族和一切劳动人民从奴役下解放出来。正是胡志明同志，最先把马克思列宁主义传播给越南人民，并且在1930年创建了越南的无产阶级政党，使越南革命进入一个崭新的阶段——无产阶级开始领导革命的阶段。
    胡志明同志是反对帝国主义的无畏的战士。他高举着民族民主革命的旗帜，领导越南人民，进行了长期的、英勇的反对法、日帝国主义的革命斗争。越南人民的革命力量，在反帝斗争的烈火中，经过艰苦曲折的道路，不断地成长壮大起来。到了1945年8月19日，在党和胡志明同志的直接领导下，越南人民举行了八月革命总起义，粉碎了近百年的殖民主义枷锁，推翻了越南成千年的君主统治，胜利地建立了人民当家作主的越南民主共和国。这是东南亚地区殖民地第一次由无产阶级政党领导人民经过武装起义，夺得政权，建立一个民族独立的国家。因此，这一胜利具有巨大的国际意义。
    帝国主义对于越南人民赢得独立的伟大胜利，是不甘心的。当越南民主共和国刚刚诞生不久，法国殖民者就在美、英帝国主义的支持下，发动了对越南人民的侵略战争，企图卷土重来，重新奴役越南人民。在党和胡志明同志的领导下，越南人民英勇顽强地进行了九年的长期抗战，给予法国侵略者以极其沉重的打击，并且粉碎了美国干涉者企图扩大印度支那战争的阴谋。越南人民的正义斗争，得到了苏联、中国和其它社会主义国家，以及全世界爱好和平人民的坚决支持，终于在1954年7月达成了日内瓦协议，恢复了印度支那的和平，对于亚洲和世界和平的事业作出了重大贡献。
    胡志明同志是越南社会主义革命和社会主义建设的英明的领导者。和平恢复以后，越南人民在党和胡志明同志的领导下，在完成土地改革和恢复国民经济的基础上，积极在北方进行社会主义改造和社会主义建设，取得了一系列的重大成就，极大地提高了越南人民的觉悟程度，日新月异地改变着越南北方的面貌。现在，越南人民正在为完成社会主义改造和发展经济文化的三年计划（1958—1960年）而进行着胜利的斗争。
    与此同时，在越南南方，美帝国主义和吴庭艳集团千方百计地破坏日内瓦协议，企图长期分割越南，把南方变成美帝国主义的殖民地和军事基地。越南人民在党和胡志明同志的领导下，正在继续为实现祖国的统一而奋斗。
    胡志明同志是杰出的无产阶级国际主义者。他一贯致力于维护和加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，维护和加强国际共产主义运动的团结，维护和加强全世界爱好和平和进步人民的团结。他十分关心、同情和支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各被压迫民族的解放斗争。他所领导的越南革命的胜利，对全世界的被压迫民族是一种很大的鼓舞。
    胡志明同志对中国人民有着特别深厚的友谊。当我们两国革命都还没有取得胜利的艰苦年月，胡志明同志就曾几次在中国许多地方，和我国人民一起做革命工作，同甘苦、共患难。因此，中国人民对胡志明同志和越南人民的感情也特别亲切。越南和中国是兄弟邻邦，两国人民是亲密的战友。我们在争取民族解放的斗争中，一向互相给予深切的同情和支持；在目前反对共同敌人美帝国主义的斗争中，在社会主义建设事业中，又进一步互相支持，互相鼓舞，紧密合作，共同前进。最近几年，胡志明同志曾几次来我国访问，更加深了中越两国人民的这种友谊和团结。正如胡志明同志最近所说：“我们两党是兄弟，我们两国政府是兄弟，我们两国人民是以伟大的苏联为首的社会主义大家庭中的兄弟。我们的团结是牢不可破的。”
    热爱祖国，热爱人民，密切联系群众，和谦逊朴素的作风，是胡志明同志非常突出的美德。无论是在过去艰苦斗争的岁月里，还是在现在领导国家建设的和平环境里，胡志明同志都始终在这些方面给人们作出了卓越的榜样。中国人民对此深为敬仰。
    今天，在胡志明同志七旬大庆的日子，中国共产党、中国人民同越南劳动党、越南人民一样，感到十分高兴。我们衷心地祝贺胡志明同志青春常在，万寿无疆；祝贺越南人民在越南劳动党及其领袖胡志明主席领导下，在社会主义建设事业中，在统一祖国和反对美帝国主义的正义斗争中，获得新的更加伟大的胜利。
