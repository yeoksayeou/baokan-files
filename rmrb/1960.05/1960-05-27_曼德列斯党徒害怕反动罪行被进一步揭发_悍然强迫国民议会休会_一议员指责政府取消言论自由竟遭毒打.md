Xinhua News Agency, May 26th Dispatch from Ankara: The ruling Democratic Party of Turkey, fearing further exposure in the National Assembly of the Menderes government's anti-people and anti-democratic crimes of betraying national interests, has brazenly forced the National Assembly to adjourn.

According to reports, on the 25th, after ruling Democratic Party members beat opposition party members who were condemning the government, causing a 90-minute interruption of the parliament, they used their majority vote to force the parliament to adjourn until June 20th after the parliament reconvened. Before the vote on the motion to adjourn, parliament erupted into another riot after an opposition member praised recent demonstrations by Turkish youth against the Menderes dictatorial government.

This is the second time in less than two weeks that the Democratic Party has forced the parliament to adjourn. Opposition members vehemently protested the Democratic Party's arbitrary act of forcing the parliament to adjourn. On the same day, Menderes delivered a speech in Eskişehir, a city in central Turkey, shamelessly declaring that he would never resign, no matter what. On the one hand, he once again announced that he would hold a general election; on the other hand, he still said that the specific date of the general election could only be determined after the national situation had calmed down. Menderes is continuing his so-called national tour to "stabilize public sentiment."

Menderes also announced on the 25th the abolition of the National Assembly's special committee to investigate the activities of the opposition Republican People's Party. This committee, composed of fifteen Democratic Party members, was established a month ago despite fierce opposition from the opposition parties. It held extremely broad powers. Menderes's measure is seen as an attempt to ease the opposition parties' dissatisfaction.

Xinhua News Agency, May 25th Dispatch from Ankara: The Turkish Parliament experienced a brawl today, causing the parliament to be interrupted for as long as 90 minutes, because ruling Democratic Party members beat Republican People's Party members who were condemning the Menderes government.

According to reports, a Republican People's Party member accused the Menderes government in the parliament today of adopting high-handed measures against the opposition parties and of abolishing freedom of speech in Turkey. Before he had finished speaking, Democratic Party members swarmed up and physically assaulted him. A melee ensued. It is reported that at least fourteen members were injured.

    曼德列斯党徒害怕反动罪行被进一步揭发
    悍然强迫国民议会休会
    一议员指责政府取消言论自由竟遭毒打
    新华社26日讯　安卡拉消息：土耳其执政的民主党由于害怕出卖民族利益的曼德列斯政府反人民、反民主的罪行进一步在国民议会中被揭发，竟强迫国民议会休会。
    据报道，25日执政的民主党议员在殴打了谴责政府的反对党议员而使议会中断九十分钟之后，在议会复会后又利用多数票强迫议会休会到6月20日。在议会就休会的动议投票以前，因为一位反对党议员称赞了土耳其青年最近举行的反对曼德列斯独裁政府的示威，议会曾再度发生骚乱。
    这是民主党在不到两个星期中第二次强迫议会休会。反对党议员激烈抗议民主党强使议会休会的专断行为。同一天，曼德列斯在土耳其中部的厄斯基色希尔城发表谈话，无耻地宣布，无论如何，他决不辞职。他一方面再次宣布要举行大选，另一方面仍然说，要等全国局势安宁以后才能确定大选的具体日期。曼德列斯是在继续他的所谓“稳定民心”的全国旅行。
    曼德列斯在25日还宣布取消国民议会调查反对党共和人民党活动的特别委员会。这个由民主党十五个议员组成的委员会，是在一个月以前不顾反对党的激烈反对而建立的。它握有极其广泛的权力。曼德列斯的这个措施被认为是企图缓和反对党的不满。
    据新华社25日讯　安卡拉消息：由于执政的民主党议员殴打谴责曼德列斯政府的共和人民党议员，土耳其议会今天发生一场殴斗，使议会中断达九十分钟。
    据报道，有一名共和人民党的议员今天在议会上指责曼德列斯政府对反对党采取高压手段并且取消了土耳其的言论自由。他的话还没有说完，民主党的议员就蜂涌而上，对他拳脚并施。一场混战就此开始。据报道，至少有十四名议员受伤。
