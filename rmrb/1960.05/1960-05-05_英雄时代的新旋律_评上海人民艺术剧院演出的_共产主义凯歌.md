    A New Melody of the Heroic Era
    ——A Review of the Shanghai People's Art Theater's Performance of "Ode to Communism"
    Chen Mo
    The heroic deeds of rescuing the "Iron Warrior" Qiu Cai Kang's life concentratedly reflect the great victory of communist thought in our lives – communist thought illuminates people's hearts with unparalleled beauty; communist thought brings about a brand-new relationship between people; communist thought inspires people to create miracles in the field of medicine. The Shanghai People's Art Theater named their play based on this event "Ode to Communism," and this title accurately expresses the profound significance of the event.
    Over the past year, we have seen many literary and artistic works praising this heroic deed. The reason why this play performed by the Shanghai People's Art Theater makes us particularly happy is that it no longer simply reports this exciting event in a simple way, but has taken a big step forward on the basis of real people and real events, and has carried out better refinement and artistic generalization of real life, and has established some distinct artistic images on the stage. The serious creation of the directors and actors, and the beautiful design of the stage artists, make this play have a strong artistic charm. The success of this play shows that under the premise of rapidly reflecting the magnificent real life, our drama art can not only create exciting reportage dramas full of the atmosphere of the times, but also gradually improve through continuous modification and polishing, and produce works with more ideological depth and more complete art.
    The main melody of this magnificent ode to the times is the successive victories of Mao Zedong Thought in our social life, especially in the medical field, and the establishment of a new group portrait with a communist style. Saving a worker with burns covering a total area of 89.3% and third-degree burns exceeding 20% is a miracle created by the socialist system in the history of world medicine. After watching this play, we can't forget the Party Secretary Qian's eloquent class analysis of bourgeois international medical literature; we can't forget the heroic spirit of the young female doctor Xiao Yang in challenging the bourgeois medical authority; we can't forget that pair of lovely Communist Youth League members – the brand new comical conflict between the steel worker Xiao Liu and the nurse Xiao Lin; we can't forget the class love of the masses who eagerly requested to donate blood and skin for Kang Yongcai. The playwright cleverly reflected these extremely moving new people and new events in life in this play, and the keynote of the heroic era became the keynote of this play.
    Kang Yongcai, the steelworker who was scalded by molten steel, did not appear on the stage as a passive patient. From the prologue, we saw that he was an excellent stoker loved by his comrades, an advanced producer who led his team to set a national steel production record seven times in a row. Therefore, after he was injured, whether his life could be saved became a strong suspense in the audience's heart. In the process of rescue, Kang Yongcai's excellent qualities of caring for the revolutionary cause and his perseverance in overcoming severe pain became an indispensable and moving melody in this ode to communism.
    Rescuing Kang Yongcai's life is a scientific battle, and even more so an ideological revolution. The ideological depth of "Ode to Communism" lies in its relatively profound revelation of the ideological significance of this revolution, and through the conflict between the characters, it reflects the sharp struggle between the socialist road and the bourgeois road in medical thought. In this play, we see three different spiritual outlooks of intellectuals. Bourgeois experts represented by "burn authority" Professor Bai, blindly believe in the conclusions of bourgeois medical literature and dare not overstep the bounds; revolutionary intellectuals represented by Dr. Xiao Yang, exerted the communist style of daring to think and daring to do, and broke the superstition of international medical literature under the leadership and support of the Party; and Professor Bai's student, Xiao Yang's father, and the director of surgery, the old Dr. Yang, underwent tremendous changes in this struggle. He gradually liberated himself from the shackles of bourgeois medical thought and finally became a member of this miracle-creating collective. This struggle is very fierce and very complex. The most exciting scene in the whole play – the expert consultation – concentrates on showing the seriousness of this struggle. Generally speaking, the meeting scene on the stage is not easy to handle, but the audience watched the progress of this play with great interest: medical experts from the British and American, German and Japanese, and French returned students gathered together. These respectable scholars could have made outstanding contributions in the battle to rescue Kang Yongcai's life, but bourgeois international medical literature bound their wisdom like a golden hoop. They were helpless in the face of the patient's serious injuries. Professor Bai, who was "highly respected," simply declared that all treatment plans were superfluous. He confidently said: "Anyway, I'm here, better than any medicine." In the "terrible silence" and pessimistic atmosphere of these medical authorities, the young Dr. Xiao Yang challenged bourgeois medical thought. The Party Secretary's persuasive class analysis further reversed the situation of the struggle. In this scene, almost every line tightly gripped the hearts of the audience, making people admire the playwright's artistic generalization power.
    The most successfully shaped character in the whole play is the image of Director Yang. I think this is a relatively complete image of a senior intellectual created in our current drama. In the expert consultation scene, we see that he has the same side as Professor Bai and other bourgeois experts. He bows down to the conclusions of bourgeois international medical literature and believes that Kang Yongcai's life can only be maintained for three days at most. In his opinion, "the widespread destruction of human tissues is an objective fact, and the pathological and physiological changes caused by tissue destruction are scientific laws, and death is the inevitable result of the evolution of laws. The death statistics in international literature are evidence of these inevitable consequences." Therefore, he believes that "medicine cannot create any miracles," which is the dominant aspect of his thought; but this character also has a progressive aspect of being willing to serve the people and willing to accept the leadership of the Party. After listening to Secretary Qian's analysis, especially after hearing the instructions from the Municipal Party Committee, his attitude began to change. "Medical record form!" The three words he shouted, although short, forcefully showed that under the enlightenment of the Party, the active aspects of his body began to take effect. These three words announced the starting point for him to fight against the bourgeois thoughts in his body.
    This play quite meticulously shows the ideological development process of Director Yang. It is obvious that for a senior intellectual like Director Yang who has been influenced by bourgeois thoughts for a long time, it is impossible to have smooth sailing to be liberated from that set of bourgeois world outlook and scientific thought that has almost become an instinct. However, the times are different after all. Director Yang lives in the Great Leap Forward era where hundreds of millions of people are fighting with high morale and high spirits, and the revolutionary wave of the objective world has accelerated the changes in his heart. The playwright accurately selected the details with character characteristics of this character's change, convincingly showing his transformation and growth.
    Director Yang accepted the arduous task of rescuing Kang Yongcai's life. The Party mobilized the masses to come up with some treatment plans, and he himself tried to come up with some methods, which achieved results, but he did not have real confidence at this time. The Shanghai steelworkers sent a letter of thanks, and he knew that this was actually a challenge, and he was not allowed to post it. It was not until Kang Yongcai safely survived the three-day shock period that this first miracle initially shook his superstition of bourgeois medical literature that he agreed to post that letter of thanks, but he was still uneasy in his heart. In his contact with Kang Yongcai, Kang Yongcai's communist spirit once moved him to tears. Countless moving examples of the Party and the people of the whole country trying their best to rescue Kang Yongcai infected him spiritually, coupled with Secretary Qian's patient guidance, his confidence gradually increased, but when the fatal Pseudomonas aeruginosa was found on Kang Yongcai's body, he wavered again; on the one hand, he secretly experimented with bacteriophages to eliminate Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and on the other hand, he advocated that only by amputating Kang Yongcai's right leg could the patient's life be saved. It was not until his daughter, Dr. Xiao Yang, led the students of the medical school to finally find the bacteriophage that he finally defeated the bourgeois conservative thoughts in his body. In this struggle, how severe a test did Lao Yang endure! From stubbornly believing in the conclusions of bourgeois medical literature, to hesitatingly investing in rescue work, through practice and the education of the Party, he finally not only won a great victory in medicine with everyone, but also took a leap forward in politics. In the last scene, he quietly told Kang Yongcai that he was already preparing to apply for Party membership. The victory of Lao Yang's ideological transformation is not only his own victory, but also the victory of the Party in transforming intellectuals! Lao Yang's road can be said to be a typical example of how the older generation of senior intellectuals in our country, under the guidance of the Party and the socialist system, transformed their thoughts in actual struggle, got rid of the shackles of the bourgeois world outlook, and embarked on the socialist road. We can fully believe that once senior intellectuals like Lao Yang find the truth of Marxism and continue to transform their thoughts in the process of continuous revolution, their science and technology will surely make outstanding contributions to socialist construction! Lao Yang's fate can be said to be a particularly meaningful melody in this ode. This melody, harmoniously intertwined with the main melody of the victory of communist new people, beautifully and richly sings the praises of our heroic era.
    Saying that this play is an outstanding one in the same genre does not mean that it is perfect. For example, compared with the image of Lao Yang, some brand-new heroic figures appear to be relatively thin. Especially like the character of Dr. Xiao Yang, the first few scenes of the play laid a solid foundation for this heroic figure. The author handled the relationship between her and Lao Yang as both a father-daughter relationship and a comrade relationship. This design is very good; in Dr. Xiao Yang's body, we can summarize more of the heroic spirit of our times, and this character can be shaped more ideally.
    The authors of this play are two young comrades. The Shanghai Municipal Party Committee specially organized an expert group to help revise and process it. Therefore, the current script is a significant improvement compared to the original script performed in 1958. As an audience, I very much hope that after the Shanghai People's Art Theater finishes this tour performance, it can further process this play and make it a more excellent repertoire.

    英雄时代的新旋律
    ——评上海人民艺术剧院演出的“共产主义凯歌”
    陈默
    抢救“钢铁战士”丘财康的生命的英雄事迹，集中地反映了我们生活中共产主义思想的伟大胜利——共产主义思想把人们的心灵照耀得无比美丽；共产主义思想使人与人之间出现了崭新的关系；共产主义思想鼓舞人们在医学领域里创造了奇迹。上海人民艺术剧院把他们取材于这个事件的话剧叫做“共产主义凯歌”，这个题名准确地表达了这个事件的深刻意义。
    一年多来，我们已经看到不少讴歌这个英雄事迹的文艺作品。上海人民艺术剧院演出的这个戏之所以特别使我们感到喜悦，是因为这个戏已经不只是朴素地报道了这个激动人心的事件，而是在真人真事的基础上大大提高了一步，对现实生活进行了较好的提炼和艺术概括，在舞台上树立起一些鲜明的艺术形象。导演和演员同志们的严肃创造，舞台美术家的优美设计，更使这个戏有着强烈的艺术魅力。这个戏的成就，说明我们的话剧艺术在迅速反映壮丽的现实生活的前提下，不仅可以创作出激动人心、洋溢着时代气息的报告剧，而且可以通过不断的修改锤炼，逐步提高，产生出更有思想深度，艺术上更加完整的作品。
    这首壮丽的时代凯歌的主要旋律，是毛泽东思想在我们的社会生活中，特别是在医学领域中的节节胜利，是具有共产主义风格的新人群像的树立。救活一位烫伤总面积达到89.3％、三度烧伤在20％以上的工人，这是社会主义制度在世界医学史上所创造的奇迹。看完这个戏，我们怎么也忘不了党委钱书记对资产阶级的国际医学文献所作的雄辩的阶级分析；忘不了年轻的女医生小杨那种向资产阶级医学权威挑战的英雄气概，忘不了那一对可爱的共青团员——钢铁工人小刘和护士小林之间崭新的喜剧性冲突；忘不了那些热切地要求为康永才输血献皮的人民群众的阶级友爱。剧作者把生活中这些极其动人的新人新事巧妙地反映在这个戏里，英雄时代的基调也就成为这个戏的基调。
    被钢水烫伤的炼钢工人康永才，不是作为一个消极的病人出现在舞台上的。从序幕里，我们就看到他是一个受到同志们爱戴的优秀司炉长、一个领导自己的班连创七次全国出钢纪录的先进生产者。因此，当他受伤后，能否挽救他的生命，就成为观众心里一个强烈的悬念。在救治的过程中，康永才关怀革命事业的优秀品质和战胜剧烈痛苦的坚毅精神，更成了这一首共产主义凯歌中不可缺少的动人的旋律。
    抢救康永才的生命，是一场科学上的战斗，更是一场思想上的革命。“共产主义凯歌”这出戏的思想深度，正是在于它比较深刻地揭示了这一场革命的思想意义，通过人物性格之间的冲突，反映了医学思想上社会主义道路和资产阶级道路的尖锐斗争。在这出戏里，我们看到三种知识分子不同的精神面貌。以“烫伤权威”白教授为代表的资产阶级专家们，迷信资产阶级医学文献的结论，不敢越出雷池一步；以小杨医生为代表的革命知识分子，发挥了敢想敢干的共产主义风格，在党的领导和支持下打破了对国际医学文献的迷信；而白教授的门生、小杨的父亲、外科主任老杨医生则在这场斗争中发生了巨大的变化，他逐步地从资产阶级医学思想的束缚中解放出来，终于成为这个创造奇迹的集体的一分子。这一场斗争是十分激烈、十分复杂的。全剧中最精彩的一场戏——专家会诊，集中地表现了这场斗争的严重性。一般说来，舞台上的会议场面是不好处理的，但观众们却以极浓厚的兴趣注视着这场戏的进展：英美派的、德日派的、法国留学的医学界专家们聚集一堂，这些值得尊敬的学者们本来是可以在抢救康永才的生命的战斗中作出卓越的贡献的，可是资产阶级的国际医学文献像金箍咒一样捆住了他们的智慧。他们在病人严重的伤势面前束手无策，“德高望重”的白教授甚至干脆宣布一切治疗方案都是多余的，他自信地说：“反正我来了，比什么药都好。”就在这些医学权威们的“可怕的沉默”和悲观气氛中，年青的小杨医生向资产阶级医学思想发出了挑战。党委书记一番富有说服力的阶级分析更扭转了斗争的形势。这一场戏，几乎每一句台词都紧紧地扣住了观众的心弦，令人不能不惊佩剧作者的艺术概括力量。
    全剧中塑造得最成功的是杨主任的形象。我觉得，这是我们当前的戏剧中创造得比较完整的一个高级知识分子的形象。在专家会诊的那场戏里，我们看到他身上既有跟白教授等资产阶级专家相同的一面，他拜倒在资产阶级国际医学文献的结论面前，认定康永才的生命最多只能维持三天。照他看来，“人体组织的广泛破坏，已经是客观存在的事实，组织破坏所引起的病理生理变化，是科学的规律，死亡就是规律演变的必然结果，国际文献上的死亡统计，就是这些必然后果的证据。”因此他认为“医学是创造不出什么奇迹的”，这是他的思想的主导方面；但是这个人物也还有着愿意为人民服务、愿意接受党的领导的进步方面，当他听完钱书记的分析，特别是听到市委的指示之后，他的态度开始有了转变。“病历表！”他喊出的这三个字，虽然简短，却有力地表明了在党的启发下，他身上的积极方面开始发生作用，这三个字，宣告了他向自己身上的资产阶级思想进行斗争的起点。
    这个戏相当细致地表现了杨主任的思想发展过程。很显然，像杨主任这样一个长期受过资产阶级思想熏陶的高级知识分子，要从几乎已经成为本能的那一套资产阶级世界观和科学思想中解放出来，决不可能是一帆风顺的。但是，时代究竟不同了，杨主任是生活在亿万群众斗志昂扬、意气风发的大跃进时代，客观世界的革命浪潮加速了他内心的变化。剧作者准确地选择了这个人物变化的具有性格特征的细节，令人信服地表现了他的转变和成长。
    杨主任接受了抢救康永才生命的艰巨任务，党委发动群众想出了一些治疗方案，他自己也努力想出了一些办法，收到了效果，但他这时并没有真正的信心。上钢工人送来了感谢信，他知道这实际上是一份挑战书，不许把它贴出去。直到康永才安全度过了三天的休克期，这第一个奇迹初步动摇了他对资产阶级医学文献的迷信，他同意把那份感谢信贴出去了，但他心里还是不踏实。在和康永才的接触中，康永才的共产主义精神曾经感动得他流出了眼泪，党和全国人民千方百计抢救康永才的无数动人事例在精神上感染了他，加上钱书记的循循诱导，他的信心逐渐增强了一些，但是当康永才的身上发现了致命的绿脓杆菌之后，他又动摇了；他一方面偷偷试验消灭绿脓杆菌的噬菌体，一方面又主张只有锯掉康永才的右腿才能保全病人的生命。直到他的女儿小杨医生领导医学院的同学们终于找到噬菌体之后，他才最后战胜了自己身上的资产阶级保守思想。在这一场斗争中，老杨医生经受了多么严重的考验啊！从顽固地信奉资产阶级医学文献的结论，到疑信参半地投入抢救工作，通过实践和党的教育，他最后不仅和大家一起在医学上打了一个大胜仗，而且在政治上飞跃了一步，在最后一幕，他悄悄地告诉康永才，他已经准备提出入党申请了。老杨医生思想改造的胜利，不仅是他本人的胜利，而且是党改造知识分子的胜利！老杨医生的道路，可以说是我国老一辈高级知识分子在党的引导和社会主义制度下，在实际斗争中改造思想，摆脱资产阶级世界观的束缚，走向社会主义道路的一个典型例子。我们完全可以相信，像老杨医生这样的高级知识分子，一旦找到马克思主义的真理，在不断革命的过程中继续改造思想，他们的科学技术一定将为社会主义建设作出卓越的贡献！老杨医生的命运，可以说是这首凯歌中特别意味深长的一个旋律。这个旋律，和共产主义新人胜利的主要旋律和谐地交织在一起，美妙而丰富地歌颂了我们的英雄时代。
    说这个戏是同类题材中突出的一个，并不是意味着它已经完美无缺了。比如，和老杨医生的形象比较起来，某些崭新的英雄人物形象显得比较单薄。特别是像小杨医生这个人物，戏的前几幕为这个英雄人物树立了一个坚实的基础，作者把她和老杨医生之间的关系处理为既是父女关系，又是同志关系，这个设计是很好的；在小杨医生的身上，可以更多地概括我们时代的英雄气概，这个人物是可能塑造得更加理想一些的。
    这个戏的作者是两位青年同志，上海市委曾特地组织了专家小组帮助修改和加工，因此，现在演出的本子比起1958年最初演出的本子来，已经有了很显著的提高。作为一个观众，我非常希望上海人民艺术剧院结束这次旅行公演之后，能够对这个戏再作进一步的加工，使它成为一个更优秀的保留剧目。
