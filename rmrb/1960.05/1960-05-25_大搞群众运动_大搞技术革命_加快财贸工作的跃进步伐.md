    Since the beginning of this year, on the finance and trade front, like other fronts, all industries and sectors have launched a high tide of technical innovation and technical revolution, and large-scale operational skills training activities have been carried out everywhere, with advanced collectives and skilled operators emerging in batches. In commodity purchasing, sales, transportation, and storage; in the processing of agricultural and sideline products and the comprehensive utilization of resources; in the catering service industry and collective welfare undertakings; in banks, finance, and other various aspects, there are innovations and creations everywhere, creating thousands upon thousands of new machines and new tools. Finance and trade departments have also done a lot of work in supporting the technical transformation of industry and agriculture and have achieved many successes. These situations show that the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the finance and trade sector has had a good start and has begun to enter a new stage of continued development, summarization and appraisal, standardization and promotion, and continuous improvement.
    Finance and trade departments are departments that manage circulation and distribution, and they are bridges between production and production, between production and consumption, and between urban and rural areas. They have close ties with the broad masses. Finance and trade departments also manage a considerable number of processing enterprises. This situation determines that the content of the technical innovation and technical revolution in the finance and trade sector is very rich and the scope is very broad, making it a very large front in the nationwide technical innovation and technical revolution movement. The technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the finance and trade sector has two aspects: one aspect is to actively support the technical transformation of agriculture, support the technical innovation and technical revolution of industry, promote the technical innovation and technical revolution of collective welfare undertakings and life service undertakings throughout society, and promote the nationwide social conservation movement; the other aspect is to vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution in various units, enterprises, and business links within the finance and trade sector. Therefore, we must combine internal and external efforts, cooperate with all parties, see both the eight million finance and trade workers and the 650 million people, and not only do a good job in the technical innovation and technical revolution of the finance and trade sector itself, but also promote the technical innovation and technical revolution of the entire society.
    In the production increase and conservation movement centered on technical innovation and technical revolution, the finance and trade sector should pay special attention to actively supporting the technical transformation of agriculture. Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy, and developing agriculture and realizing the technical transformation of agriculture as soon as possible are of great significance for accelerating the pace of socialist construction. Finance and trade departments have extensive ties with agricultural production and must regard supporting the technical transformation of agriculture and promoting the early realization of the National Program for Agricultural Development as their glorious task. In supporting the technical transformation of agriculture, finance and trade departments should do everything possible to support the mechanization, water conservancy, and electrification of agriculture by participating in planning, participating in production, providing technology, raising funds, supplying materials, and doing a good job in repair and maintenance. They should promote the all-round development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries through the establishment of commodity bases, through the agricultural product purchasing movement, through the "small summer harvest" and "small autumn harvest" movements, and through the agricultural and sideline product processing movement, and assist in arranging the production layout of various crops such as grain, cotton, oil, hemp, silk, tea, sugar, vegetables, tobacco, fruits, medicine, and miscellaneous crops. They should vigorously support the rapid development of rural people's commune industries, help commune-run industries break through the raw material barrier, equipment barrier, and technical barrier, participate in and promote the implementation of economic accounting and improvement of business management in commune-run industries, and strengthen the equipment of agriculture by equipping commune-run industries. In short, in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, finance and trade departments should fully mobilize the masses, everyone should contribute ideas and suggestions, and do everything possible to actively support the technical transformation of agriculture, in order to accelerate the process of agricultural mechanization, water conservancy, and electrification, and develop agricultural production at high speed.
    In the movement to consolidate and develop rural people's communes and establish urban people's communes, finance and trade departments should become powerful assistants to party committees at all levels in comprehensively organizing people's lives, and should actively help urban and rural people's communes carry out technical innovation and technical revolution in collective welfare undertakings and life service undertakings, in order to save a large amount of social living labor and materialized labor, and promote the socialization of housework and the collectivization of life. Taking canteens as an example, now more than 80% of the people in the country eat in public canteens, and there are more than 10 million cooks in the canteens, and rice milling and flour milling still occupy a large amount of manpower and animal power. If the public canteens across the country realize mechanization and semi-mechanization in rice milling, flour milling, cooking, and water carrying, it will be possible to save millions of labor forces to invest in industrial and agricultural production, which is a great social saving. Not only in cooking should mechanization and semi-mechanization be realized, but also in shoe making, sewing, laundry, repair, and other social collective welfare undertakings and life service undertakings, mechanization and semi-mechanization should be gradually realized according to conditions. Every technical innovation in these areas will have a huge effect on saving social labor and saving social material wealth. At the same time, finance and trade departments should also actively participate in and promote the nationwide social conservation movement of saving grain, saving coal, and saving cotton cloth. Even a simple technical innovation in these areas can save a large amount of material wealth for the whole society.
    At present, some work links in the finance and trade sector still have heavy manual labor, heavy manual operations still account for a considerable proportion in various aspects, and the material and technical equipment in various links is still relatively poor, and there is an urgent need for mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation. In the near future, heavy manual labor and heavy manual operations should first be changed to mechanical operations. Finance and trade departments often keep goods worth tens of billions of yuan, and hundreds of millions of tons of goods enter and leave warehouses every year. If mechanization and semi-mechanization are realized in major links such as loading and unloading, handling, stacking, packaging, and drying, and further automation and semi-automation are realized in some units, it will be possible to save a lot of labor, and achieve extremely huge results in accelerating commodity turnover, reducing commodity losses, saving circulation costs, changing the technical face of finance and trade work, and changing the spiritual face of finance and trade workers. Finance and trade departments are connected with industrial and agricultural production units and the people of the whole country in purchasing goods, supplying goods, managing money, managing accounts, and managing economic accounting. If all mechanical means are used in weighing, measuring, inspecting, packaging, counting money, issuing invoices, bookkeeping, and calculating, and at the same time continuously improve manual operation skills and improve labor organization, the service quality of finance and trade work will be greatly improved, the time of industrial and agricultural production units and the broad masses of people will be greatly saved, and the technical face of commodity circulation, accounting and cashiering, and economic accounting work in the whole society will be fundamentally changed, so as to better serve production and the people's lives. The processing factories affiliated to the finance and trade departments undertake the processing tasks of most agricultural and sideline products. Only by further mobilizing the masses of workers, seeking to realize the mechanization and semi-mechanization of all these processing enterprises in a not too long time, and gradually realizing automation and semi-automation, developing comprehensive utilization, and greatly increasing labor productivity and increasing more products, can we adapt to the ever-increasing needs of agricultural and sideline product processing.
    In general, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the finance and trade sector has broad paths and heavy tasks. Every major innovation will receive huge economic and political effects. We now have a good start. We must have lofty ambitions, set high goals, muster the greatest revolutionary drive, and move forward steadily.
    In order to carry out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the finance and trade sector more widely and deeply, and to ensure the continued leap forward of finance and trade work in 1960, according to past experience and the current development of the movement, we should pay attention to the following issues:
    First, under the leadership of the party, continue to adhere to putting politics in command and launch mass movements on a large scale. Politics is always the soul and commander of all work, and to launch technical innovation and technical revolution on a large scale, we must adhere to putting politics in command. The mass line is the fundamental political line and organizational line of our party, and to launch technical innovation and technical revolution on a large scale, we must implement the mass line. Experience has proved that wherever politics is put in command, wherever the mass movement is carried out extensively and deeply, there will be a magnificent situation of technical innovation and technical revolution. The broad masses of workers are most familiar with their own labor, they most hope to innovate, and they also understand best what should be innovated and how to innovate. As long as the masses are mobilized, a conscious revolutionary torrent will be formed, and inventions and creations will be constantly carried out. Therefore, it is necessary to conscientiously do a good job in political and ideological work and propaganda and education work among the broad masses, mobilize the revolutionary enthusiasm of finance and trade workers, constantly promote the spirit of the working class to study diligently, create boldly, and strive to become stronger, and constantly overcome the conservative ideas of some people. The technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the finance and trade sector should serve the central work of the party and should be closely combined with the central tasks of the party in various periods. The leading organs and leaders of the finance and trade sector should promptly discover and enthusiastically support all new things, support every innovation and creation of the masses, fully promote the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do, and the communist spirit of cooperation of "leaving difficulties to oneself and giving convenience to others," so that the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the finance and trade sector can develop in a broader, deeper, and higher direction.
    Second, summarize and appraise, standardize and coordinate, grasp the key points, and comprehensively promote, which is an important link for the further development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the finance and trade sector at present. According to existing experience, as long as we continue to mobilize the masses to carry out creation and invention, at the same time, we seriously summarize and appraise the existing innovation achievements, seize the standardization and coordination, and vigorously popularize and promote them, it will be possible to save a lot of social manpower, material resources, and financial resources, and gradually change the technical face of finance and trade work. In popularizing and promoting, we must grasp the key points. The so-called key points are projects that can save the most living labor and materialized labor, are the simplest to manufacture, use the least materials, have the lowest cost, and are the easiest to learn and promote. First of all, we must pay special attention to promoting projects that can save a lot of social labor. The technical innovation and technical revolution of the finance and trade sector itself should also find out the projects that can save the most living labor and materialized labor to promote.
    Third, adhere to the idea of continuous revolution, constantly innovate, and constantly improve. Technical innovation and technical revolution are never-ending, and the history of social productive forces development is the history of the people constantly innovating technology. We must always look forward, have the idea of continuous revolution that is never satisfied with the status quo, and constantly innovate and create, and constantly popularize and improve. In the process of continuous development of social productive forces, popularization work and improvement work are interdependent. Chairman Mao pointed out in his "Speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art": "Popularization work and improvement work cannot be completely separated. ... Our improvement is an improvement on the basis of popularization; our popularization is a popularization under the guidance of improvement." We believe that Chairman Mao's instruction is not only applicable to literature and art, but also applicable to technical innovation and technical revolution. The law of technical innovation and technical revolution is like this: popularization, improvement, then popularization again, then improvement again, circulating back and forth, endlessly, and constantly developing to a higher stage. As long as we deeply understand Chairman Mao's idea of combining continuous revolution and the theory of the stages of revolutionary development, we can guide the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the finance and trade sector to move forward wave after wave.
    Fourth, we should continue to implement the principle of combining foreign and indigenous methods. In the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, we should proceed from the actual situation, and adopt foreign methods if possible, and adopt indigenous methods if possible. Whether to adopt foreign methods or indigenous methods, or adopt semi-foreign and semi-indigenous methods, should be determined according to specific conditions. The finance and trade sector has many institutions, is widely distributed, and the general technical level is relatively low. It is very important to adopt the method of starting with indigenous methods and gradually improving. Starting with indigenous methods, equipment can be simple and crude, which is relatively easy to create, and raw materials and materials are also relatively easy to solve. As long as we use our brains and think of ways, we can do it everywhere. Therefore, it is more convenient to mobilize the broad masses to act quickly and achieve significant results. We must resolutely implement the principle of combining foreign and indigenous methods and combining them with each other, which is the best way to fully mobilize all positive factors to carry out technical innovation and technical revolution in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way.
    Fifth, adhere to the principle of self-reliance as the main principle. In the further development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the finance and trade sector, it is necessary to mobilize the broad masses of workers to learn science and technology, cultivate their own red and expert technical team to solve the problem of not understanding technology and insufficient technical strength; it is necessary to actively create conditions, start their own iron and steel smelting, and establish small-scale steel bases to solve the problem of raw materials and materials in the technical revolution; it is necessary to set up foreign, indigenous, and foreign-indigenous combined machine manufacturing and repair factories to manufacture and repair various machines and tools to solve the needs of machines, tools, and equipment. The finance and trade sector adheres to the principle of self-reliance as the main principle from iron and steel smelting to repair and manufacturing, from learning science and technology to mastering and using science and technology, which can lay a reliable foundation for the further development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, and open up broad prospects for the vigorous development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. Of course, while building our own homes self-reliantly, the finance and trade departments in various regions and the various units of the finance and trade departments should promote the spirit of communist cooperation, support each other, help each other, and develop together; the finance and trade departments should actively consult industrial production departments and scientific research departments and strive for all possible support; the finance and trade departments should make full use of the materials supplied by the state according to the plan, and maximize the existing material strength.
    Sixth, widely launch a mass movement to study Chairman Mao's works and study culture, science, and technology. The technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the finance and trade sector should be combined with the current nationwide movement to study Marxism-Leninism theory and study Chairman Mao's works, so that our technical innovation and technical revolution movement has correct ideological guidance. As long as we master Mao Zedong Thought and establish correct positions, viewpoints, and methods, people will become smarter, and the flowers of technical innovation and technical revolution will bloom in a riot of color. Therefore, the broad masses of cadres and workers in the finance and trade sector should take the study of Chairman Mao's works as the ideological driving force for promoting and guiding the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, and use ideological revolution to promote technical revolution.
    With the development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the broad masses of workers urgently demand to improve their cultural and scientific and technological level. The rapid development of the cultural revolution will inevitably accelerate the process of technical innovation and technical revolution. At present, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers to learn culture, science, and technology is very high, and we must cherish this enthusiasm of the masses and actively lead it. On the one hand, we must run various professional and amateur cultural, scientific, and technological schools, short-term training courses, etc., to systematically improve the cultural, scientific, and technological level of workers; on the other hand, we must make use of various forms such as large-scale operational skills training, technical performance competitions, on-site observation, mutual teaching and mutual learning, and package teaching and package learning, so that the masses of workers can quickly learn and master advanced technologies. We must especially strengthen the leadership of the learning of young workers, and we must make them successors with communist consciousness and cultural, scientific, and technological knowledge. In this way, they will not only be able to inherit all the useful knowledge and technology of the previous generation, but they will certainly surpass their predecessors.
    We must have great revolutionary spirit and a high degree of revolutionary enthusiasm, we must have the spirit of not being superstitious, not being inferior, and striving to become stronger, we must have the perseverance and determination to not be afraid of hard work and difficulties, not be afraid of setbacks and failures, and resolutely complete the task, and resolutely oppose the coward and lazy man's world view that this cannot be done and that is also impossible. Let us hold high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, hold high the banner of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, set off a competitive upsurge of learning from the advanced, comparing with the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and helping the backward, and push the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the finance and trade sector to a new stage of development.

    大搞群众运动　大搞技术革命　加快财贸工作的跃进步伐
    中共中央财政贸易工作部部长　马明方
    今年以来，在财贸战线上，和其他战线一样，各行各业都掀起了技术革新和技术革命的高潮，到处开展了操作技术大练兵的活动，先进集体和操作能手成批出现。在商品收购、销售、调运、储存等方面；在农副产品加工和资源综合利用方面；在饮食服务事业和集体福利事业方面；在银行、财政以及其它各个方面，到处都有革新和创举，创造了成千上万的新机器和新工具；财贸各部门在支援工业和农业的技术改造上，也作了许多的工作，取得了不少的成绩。这些情况说明，财贸部门的技术革新和技术革命运动，已经有了一个良好的开端，并且开始进入一个继续发展、总结鉴定、定型推广、不断提高的新阶段。
    财贸部门是管理流通和分配的部门，是生产与生产之间、生产与消费之间、城市与乡村之间的桥梁，它与广大群众有密切的联系。财贸部门还管理着为数不少的加工企业。这种情况，决定了财贸部门的技术革新和技术革命的内容很丰富，范围很广阔，是全民的技术革新和技术革命运动中一个很广大的战线。财贸部门的技术革新和技术革命运动有两个方面，一个方面是积极支援农业的技术改造，支援工业的技术革新和技术革命，促进全社会的集体福利事业和生活服务事业的技术革新和技术革命，促进全民性的社会节约运动；另一个方面是大力开展财贸部门内部各个单位、各个企业、各个业务环节上的技术革新和技术革命。因此，我们必须内外结合，协作各方，既看到八百万财贸职工，又看到六亿五千万人民，既搞好财贸部门本身的技术革新和技术革命，又促进全社会的技术革新和技术革命。
    在以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动中，财贸部门要特别注意积极支援农业的技术改造。农业是国民经济的基础，发展农业，尽快地实现农业的技术改造，对于加快社会主义建设的速度，有着极为重要的意义。财贸部门同农业生产有着广泛的联系，必须把支援农业的技术改造和促进全国农业发展纲要的提前实现，当作自己的光荣任务。财贸部门在支援农业技术改造中，应当千方百计地从参与规划、参与生产、提供技术、筹集资金、供应物资、搞好修配等方面，支援农业的机械化、水利化、电气化；应当通过建立商品基地的工作，通过农产品收购运动，通过“小夏收”“小秋收”运动，通过农副产品加工运动，促进农、林、牧、副、渔的全面发展，协助安排粮、棉、油、麻、丝、茶、糖、菜、烟、果、药、杂等各种农作物的生产布局；应当大力支援农村人民公社工业的迅速发展，帮助社办工业突破原料关、设备关、技术关，参与和促进社办工业实行经济核算、改善经营管理，通过装备社办工业的办法来加强装备农业。总之，财贸部门在技术革新和技术革命运动中，要充分发动群众，人人献计献策，想尽一切办法积极支援农业的技术改造，以加快农业机械化、水利化、电气化的进程，高速度地发展农业生产。
    在巩固发展农村人民公社和建立城市人民公社的运动中，财贸部门应当成为各级党委全面组织人民生活的有力助手，应当积极帮助城市和农村的人民公社开展集体福利事业和生活服务事业的技术革新和技术革命，以节约大量的社会活劳动和物化劳动，促进家务劳动社会化、生活集体化。以食堂为例来说，现在全国有80％以上的人在公共食堂吃饭，食堂的炊事员有一千万人以上，碾米磨面还占用着大量的人力和畜力。如果全国的公共食堂在碾米、磨面、做饭、挑水方面实现了机械化、半机械化，就有可能节省几百万劳动力投入工农业生产，这是一项很大的社会节约。不仅在做饭方面，应当实现机械化、半机械化，而且在做鞋、缝衣、洗衣、修补以及其它社会集体福利事业和生活服务事业方面，都应当根据条件逐步实现机械化、半机械化。在这些方面的每一项技术革新，对于节约社会劳动力和节约社会物质财富都会产生巨大的效果。同时，财贸部门还应当积极参与和促进节约粮食、节约煤炭、节约棉布等全民性的社会节约运动，在这些方面那怕是一项简单的技术革新，也能为全社会节约大量的物质财富。
    现在财贸部门有些工作环节还存在着笨重的体力劳动，繁重的手工操作在各方面还占着相当大的比重，各个环节的物质技术设备还比较差，迫切地需要机械化、半机械化，自动化、半自动化。在最近一个时期内，首先应当把笨重体力劳动和繁重手工操作改成为机械操作。财贸部门经常保管着价值几百亿元的商品，一年有成亿吨的货物进出仓库，如果在装卸、搬运、码垛、包装、晾晒等主要环节上实现机械化、半机械化，并进而在一部分单位实现自动化、半自动化，就有可能节约大量的劳动力，并在加速商品周转、降低商品损耗、节约流通费用、改变财贸工作技术面貌和财贸职工精神面貌等许多方面取得极为巨大的成效。财贸部门在收购商品、供应商品、管钱、管账、管经济核算等方面，与全国工农业生产单位和全国人民发生联系，如果在秤、量、检验、包扎、点款、开票、记账、计算等方面，凡是能使用机械的都使用机械，同时不断提高手工操作技术和改进劳动组织，就会大大提高财贸工作的服务质量，大大节约工农业生产单位和广大人民群众的时间，从根本上改变全社会的商品流转、会计出纳和经济核算工作的技术面貌，更好地为生产、为人民生活服务。财贸部门所属的加工工厂，担负着大部分农副产品的加工任务，只有进一步发动职工群众，求得在不太长的时间内使这些加工企业全部实现机械化和半机械化，并逐步实现自动化和半自动化，发展综合利用，更大地提高劳动生产率，增加更多的产品，才能同农副产品加工日益增长的需要相适应。
    总起来说，财贸部门的技术革新和技术革命运动，门路是宽广的，任务是重大的。每一项重大革新都会收到巨大的经济效果和政治效果。我们现在已经有了一个良好的开端。我们必须树雄心，立壮志，鼓足最大的革命干劲，踏踏实实地向前迈进。
    为了更广泛、更深入地开展财贸部门的技术革新和技术革命运动，保证1960年财贸工作继续跃进，根据过去的经验和当前运动的发展情况，我们应当注意以下几个问题：
    第一，在党的领导下，继续坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动。政治永远是一切工作的灵魂和统帅，要大搞技术革新和技术革命，必须坚持政治挂帅。群众路线是我们党的根本的政治路线和组织路线，要大搞技术革新和技术革命，必须贯彻执行群众路线。经验证明，哪里政治挂了帅，哪里的群众运动开展得广泛深入，哪里的技术革新和技术革命就出现波澜壮阔的局面。广大职工群众最熟悉自己的劳动，他们最希望革新，也最了解应当革新什么和怎样革新。只要把群众发动起来，就会形成自觉的革命洪流，不断地进行发明创造。因此，要在广大群众中，认真做好政治思想工作和宣传教育工作，调动财贸职工的革命积极性，不断地发扬工人阶级刻苦钻研、大胆创造、发奋图强的精神，不断地克服某些人的因循守旧思想。财贸部门的技术革新和技术革命运动，应当为党的中心工作服务，应当与各个时期党的中心任务密切结合。财贸部门的领导机关和领导人员，应当及时发现和热情支持一切新鲜事物，支持群众的每一项革新和创举，充分发扬敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格和“把困难留给自己，把方便让给别人”的共产主义协作精神，使财贸部门的技术革新和技术革命运动，向更广、更深、更高的方向发展。
    第二，总结鉴定，定型配套，抓住重点，全面推广，这是当前财贸部门技术革新和技术革命运动进一步发展的重要环节。根据现有的经验看来，只要在继续发动群众进行创造发明的同时，对已有的革新成就，认真加以总结鉴定，抓紧定型配套，大力普及推广，就有可能大量节约社会人力、物力和财力，逐步改变财贸工作的技术面貌。在普及推广中，要抓住重点。所谓重点，就是能够最大限度地节约活劳动和物化劳动、制造最简便、用料最少、成本最低、最便于学习推广的项目。首先要特别注意推广那些能节约大量社会劳动的项目。财贸部门本身的技术革新和技术革命，也应当找出能够最多地节约活劳动与物化劳动的项目来推广。
    第三，坚持不断革命的思想，不断革新，不断提高。技术革新和技术革命是永远没有止境的，社会生产力发展的历史，就是人民群众不断革新技术的历史。我们一定要永远向前看，要有永远不满足于现状的不断革命的思想，要不断革新创造，不断普及提高。在社会生产力不断发展的过程中，普及工作和提高工作是相互依存的。毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”中指出：“普及工作和提高工作是不能截然分开的。……我们的提高，是在普及基础上的提高；我们的普及，是在提高指导下的普及。”我们认为，毛主席的这个指示，不仅适用于文艺方面，而且同样适用于技术革新和技术革命方面。技术革新和技术革命的规律就是这样：普及、提高，再普及、再提高，循环往复，以至无穷，不断地向更高的阶段发展。只要深刻地认识了毛主席的不断革命论和革命发展阶段论相结合的思想，我们就能够指导财贸部门的技术革新和技术革命运动，一浪推一浪地不断前进。
    第四，应当继续贯彻洋土并举的方针。在技术革新和技术革命运动中，应当从实际情况出发，能采取洋办法的就采取洋办法，能采取土办法的就采取土办法。采取洋办法还是土办法，或者采取半洋半土的办法，要根据具体条件来决定。财贸部门机构多，分布广，技术水平一般的比较低，采用土法上马，逐步提高的办法，是很重要的。土法上马，设备可以因陋就简，比较容易创制，原料材料也比较容易解决，只要动脑筋，想办法，到处都能搞。因此，就更便于动员广大群众迅速行动起来，取得显著效果。我们必须坚决贯彻洋土并举、相互结合的方针，这是充分调动一切积极因素多快好省地开展技术革新和技术革命的最好途径。
    第五，坚持自力更生为主的原则。财贸部门在进一步开展技术革新和技术革命运动中，需要发动广大职工学习科学技术，培养自己又红又专的技术队伍，来解决不懂技术和技术力量不足的问题；需要积极创造条件，自己动手炼铁炼钢，建立小型的钢铁基地，来解决技术革命中的原料材料问题；需要创办洋的、土的、洋土结合的机器制造修理工厂，自己制造和修理各种机器工具，来解决机器、工具和设备的需要。财贸部门从炼铁炼钢到修理制造，从学习科学技术到掌握使用科学技术，都坚持自力更生为主的原则，就能够为进一步开展技术革新和技术革命运动打下可靠的基础，为技术革新和技术革命运动的蓬勃发展开辟广阔的道路。当然，在自力更生地建立家务的同时，各地区财贸部门之间和财贸部门各单位之间，应当发扬共产主义大协作的精神，相互支持，相互帮助，共同发展；财贸部门应当积极地向工业生产部门、科学研究部门请教和争取各种可能的支援；财贸部门应当充分利用国家按照计划供应的物资，最大限度地发挥现有的物资力量。
    第六，广泛地掀起一个学习毛主席著作和学习文化科学技术的群众运动。财贸部门的技术革新和技术革命运动，应当同当前全民性的学习马克思列宁主义理论、学习毛主席著作的运动结合起来，使我们的技术革新和技术革命运动有正确的思想指导。只要掌握了毛泽东思想，树立了正确的立场、观点和方法，人们就会变得更聪明，技术革新和技术革命之花，就会开得万紫千红。因此，财贸部门的广大干部和职工，要把学习毛主席著作，作为推动和指导技术革新和技术革命运动的思想动力，以思想革命推动技术革命。
    随着技术革新和技术革命运动的发展，广大职工迫切要求提高文化和科学技术水平。文化革命的迅速发展，又必然会加速技术革新和技术革命的进程。现在广大职工学习文化科学技术的热情十分高涨，我们要珍视群众的这种学习热情，积极地加以领导。一方面，我们要举办各种专业的和业余的文化科学技术学校、短期训练班等，系统地提高职工的文化科学技术水平；另一方面，我们要通过操作技术大练兵、技术表演赛、现场观摩、互教互学、包教包学等各种形式，使职工群众迅速学会和掌握先进技术。对青年职工的学习要特别加强领导，必须使他们成为具有共产主义觉悟的有文化科学技术知识的接班人。这样，他们不仅能够继承前一辈一切有用的知识和技术，而且一定会超过他们的前辈。
    我们要具有伟大的革命气魄和高度的革命热情，要有不迷信、不自卑、发奋图强的精神，要有不怕艰苦困难、不怕挫折失败、坚决完成任务的毅力和决心，坚决反对这也办不到，那也不可能的懦夫和懒汉的世界观。让我们高举毛泽东思想的旗帜，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的旗帜，掀起学先进、比先进、赶先进、帮后进的竞赛热潮，把财贸部门的技术革新和技术革命运动，推向一个新的发展阶段。
