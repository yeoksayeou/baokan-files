Qingxu Chengguan Commune Presents a Festive Scene
Over Four Thousand Commune Members Gather to Review Their Production Achievements

    (Reported by this newspaper) On the "May Day" holiday, the Chengguan People's Commune in Qingxu County, Shanxi, was filled with a festive atmosphere. Early in the morning, more than four thousand commune members, beating drums and gongs, carried good-news reports to a gathering at "Baishitan" near the commune to celebrate their holiday, presenting the holiday with outstanding production achievements. As soon as the celebration ended, the commune members immediately launched a blitz, initially constructing a fish pond on a 130-mu river滩 (tān) - shoal, sandbar, or bank- the area, introducing a long stream of water into the pond. This year, 150,000 fish fry can be released, and profits can be made from fishing next year.
    The employees of the commune's machinery repair plant, which won the Red Flag for Tool Revolution from the Shanxi Provincial Department of Industry, successfully trial-produced and modified 16 new types of agricultural implements before "May Day." These implements are easy to use, low in cost, and highly efficient. Sun Tingyuan, a young apprentice, created the "Three-in-One" vegetable planter, which can complete the three processes of artificial sowing, ridge pulling, seed placement, and sand spreading in one go, increasing efficiency by 18 times and ensuring uniform and meticulous sowing quality.
    The mass-based tribute activities have powerfully promoted the current production. By May 1st, more than 8,000 mu of major crops such as corn, sorghum, yam, cotton, and sugar beets had been sown according to the state-assigned planting plan, 5 to 15 days earlier than last year. The entire commune completed the task of watering and fertilizing 4,000 mu of wheat at the jointing stage five days ahead of schedule, laying a good foundation for a bumper wheat harvest in the summer.

    清徐城关公社一片节日景象
    四千多社员集会检阅自己生产成绩
    本报讯　“五一”节这天，山西清徐县城关人民公社到处呈现出一片节日景象。一早，四千多名社员就敲锣打鼓地抬着喜报到公社附近的“百石滩”集会，庆祝自己的节日，他们以出色的生产成绩，向这个节日献了礼。庆祝会一结束，社员们就地展开突击战，在占地一百三十亩的河滩里，初步修成了一个养鱼池，把一股长流水引入水池，今年可以放入鱼苗十五万尾，明年就能捕捞得利。
    荣获山西省工业厅工具革命红旗的公社机械修配厂职工，在“五一”节前试制和改制成功了十六种新式农具，这些农具使用轻便、成本低、工效高。青年学徒孙廷元创造的“三合”种菜器，能够把过去用人工播种拉垅、下子、铺沙三道工序一次做完，工效提高十八倍，播种质量均匀、细致。
    群众性的献礼活动，有力地推动了当前的各项生产。到5月1日止，全社的玉米、高粱、山药、棉花、糖萝卜等主要作物八千多亩已经按国家分配种植计划播种完毕，比去年提早了五至十五天。全社提前五天完成了四千亩小麦浇拔节水、追拔节肥的任务，为夏季小麦大丰收打下了良好基础。
