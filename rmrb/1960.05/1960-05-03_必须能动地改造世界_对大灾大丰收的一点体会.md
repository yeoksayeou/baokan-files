Must Actively Transform the World
——Some Thoughts on Great Disaster and Great Harvest
Liú Déjùn, First Secretary of the Luótián County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Húběi Province

In 1959, the people of Luótián tamed three floods and overcame a hundred days of severe drought, achieving a great victory of great disaster and great harvest. This was the result of people fully utilizing their subjective initiative based on objective laws. So, how can we fully utilize people's subjective initiative? This is a significant topic, and I can only share some superficial experiences based on the facts of the "great disaster and great harvest."

Earnestly Study Mao Zedong Thought, Correctly Understand the Relationship Between the Objective and the Subjective

Earnestly studying Mao Zedong Thought and correctly understanding the relationship between the objective and the subjective are fundamental to fully utilizing subjective initiative. Chairman Mao said: "We oppose looking at problems subjectively because a person's ideas, if not based on and conforming to objective facts, are fantasies and false principles. If acted upon, they will lead to failure and must be opposed. However, everything is done by people… To do things well, one must first base oneself on objective facts, derive ideas, principles, and opinions, and propose plans, policies, strategies, and tactics. Ideas, etc., are subjective, while doing or acting is the subjective manifested in the objective, both of which are unique human activities. This activity, we call 'conscious activity,' is the characteristic that distinguishes humans from objects. All ideas based on and conforming to objective facts are correct ideas, and all actions based on correct ideas are correct actions. We must promote such ideas and actions, and we must promote this conscious activity." Chairman Mao's words clearly explain the relationship between the objective and the subjective. The relationship between the objective and the subjective involves both objective processes independent of people's will and subjective activities carried out by people according to their will. Subjective initiative can only be fully utilized when based on a correct understanding of objective laws. Separating these two aspects will lead to various errors.

Human subjective initiative can certainly be fully utilized based on objective laws, but it does not mean that people are powerless in the face of objective laws. Believing that "people are tied down by objective laws" would be a right-leaning opportunist error. Chairman Mao taught us: "The most important issue in Marxist philosophy is not understanding the laws of the objective world and thus being able to explain the world, but using this understanding of objective laws to actively transform the world." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Vol. 1, pp. 280-281). Lenin also said: "'Everything depends on us,' and workers and peasants should firmly remember this truth." (Complete Works of Lenin, Vol. 26, p. 386). Therefore, only by utilizing objective laws and fully utilizing subjective initiative can people generate inexhaustible power. Especially in the present great era where "one day equals twenty years," as long as we follow Marxism-Leninism, hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and implement the General Line of "going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism," the subjective initiative of the people will become the decisive factor in achieving all victories, given certain objective conditions. The soaring revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of people, their firm belief in "man will conquer nature," their ambition to quickly change "poverty and blankness," their bold statements to "make mountains bow their heads and rivers give way," and their daring communist style of thinking, speaking, and acting are all manifestations of the enormous role of human subjective initiative. The "great disaster and great harvest" in Luótián fully proves this point. In 1959, under the direct leadership of the provincial and regional Party committees, the Luótián County Committee led the people of the county in fighting natural disasters, following Chairman Mao's instructions and the spirit of the General Line. They both emphasized and correctly assessed the subjective initiative of the people, proposing slogans such as "Great Leap Forward in drought resistance, great harvest despite great disaster," and "Every seedling must be saved, every drop of water must be fought for, resist drought to the end, and never stop until victory." They also based themselves on the objective conditions at the time, first concentrating their efforts to win the first battle—saving the mid-season rice; then concentrating their efforts to win the second battle—saving the late rice. Originally, some places had neglected the subjective initiative of people in the drought resistance struggle, harboring thoughts of "relying on the heavens for food." After studying Mao Zedong Thought and arming the cadres and masses, they formed a huge force. In the long-term drought resistance movement, more than 150,000 drought resistance troops were mobilized throughout the county, using 36 water pumps and more than 11,000 waterwheels, engaging in large-scale opening of sources and interception of flow, opening 51 canals five to ten li long, and two canals more than ten li long, and moving water two to five li in 118 places. In this way, in addition to saving ordinary drought-stricken fields, they also saved more than 274,400 mu of severely drought-stricken fields, winning a "great disaster and great harvest." In 1959, the county's total agricultural and sideline production value increased by nearly 20% compared with the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, and the total grain output maintained the Great Leap Forward level of 1958 despite the extreme disaster. All these facts fully demonstrate that "everything depends on human effort" and "man will conquer nature" is a true principle. As long as people's subjective initiative is fully utilized, objective laws can be fully utilized, and unfavorable objective conditions can be quickly transformed into favorable conditions. The view that people are powerless in the face of objective conditions is completely wrong.

Of course, emphasizing the enormous role of human subjective initiative and believing that "everything depends on human effort" does not mean that people can eliminate objective laws and deny the fundamental principle of "objective primacy." If one ignores objective laws and engages in wild thinking and blind action, trying to "catch fish in the sky and scoop the moon from the bottom of the sea," then it cannot be called fully utilizing human subjective initiative, but rather subjective idealism. In this way, nothing will be accomplished. Therefore, while emphasizing the role of subjective initiative and believing that "everything depends on human effort," we must also oppose subjective idealism. If we do not organize and mobilize 150,000 drought resistance troops, do not use more than 10,000 waterwheels and more than 30 pumps, and do not build so many canals, that is to say, if we do not rely on these objective conditions and do not fully utilize the role of these objective conditions, and only have the desire to overcome the drought, it would be impossible to obtain the result of "great disaster and great harvest."

Continuously Improve Ideological Understanding in Practice, Have Foresight, Determination, and Creativity in Everything

Correctly understanding the relationship between the objective and the subjective and fully assessing the role of human subjective initiative, although a fundamental issue, still requires continuous improvement of ideological understanding and foresight, determination, and creativity in every specific practice. Human subjective initiative is always inseparable from a certain degree of foresight. Only by understanding the trends of development and change of things and foreseeing the consequences of actions can people's actions in practice be conscious. To achieve this, it is necessary to grasp the laws of development of objective things. The more profoundly the objective laws are understood, the more far-sighted the scientific foresight will be, the less blindness in practice will be, and the greater the subjective initiative will be. In 1959, after leading the masses to successively overcome three major floods, the Luótuó Commune Party Committee foresaw that "long rains will inevitably be followed by long sunny periods, and major floods will inevitably be followed by major droughts." Therefore, through various methods, they mobilized and organized cadres and the masses early to repair drought resistance tools, build dams and waterwheels to irrigate ponds and fields, and deepen and widen the main canal of the Lóngwángyán Reservoir. However, some people with right-leaning conservative ideas did not understand the trend of development and had no scientific foresight, so they resisted as soon as they heard the Party Committee put forward the slogan of drought prevention. In response to this idea, the commune Party committee used methods such as accounting comparisons to explain to the broad masses of cadres and people the principle of "resisting drought early if there is drought, and preventing drought early if there is no drought" and "preparedness averts peril," taking the initiative in drought resistance and better exerting human subjective initiative. In just over a month, the entire commune repaired 3,634 small-scale water conservancy projects such as river dikes damaged by mountain floods, wheeled water to irrigate 483 ponds, and expanded the irrigated area by more than 31,000 mu, achieving a great harvest despite the great disaster. The total grain output of the entire commune increased by 12.5% compared with the Great Leap Forward year of 1958. It seems that it is very important to have foresight in doing things. But this does not mean that people must understand all aspects of future events clearly before they can begin to act. Chairman Mao said: "Marxists are not fortune-tellers. The future development and changes should and can only be said to have a general direction, and it should not and cannot be mechanically stipulated by the day." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Vol. 1, p. 110). Correct actions are certainly guided by correct understanding, but correct understanding must be gradually improved through practice and eventually reach perfection. Therefore, to improve the ability of scientific foresight, in addition to relying on one's own scientific knowledge, the most important thing is to rely on practice. Chairman Mao proposed in On Practice: "Practice, knowledge, again practice, again knowledge, this form repeats itself infinitely, and the content of each cycle of practice and knowledge is comparatively advanced to a higher level." If we do not understand this principle, it will not only be unfavorable to exerting subjective initiative, but will also greatly restrict people's subjective initiative.

Having scientific foresight provides a preliminary belief in victory, but in actual actions, many obstacles will still be encountered, so it is necessary to have determination. The so-called determination is revolutionary thoroughness. Chairman Mao's story of "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" fully illustrates the importance of determination. The saying "Where there's a will, there's a way" also illustrates this principle. Therefore, subjective initiative and determination are consistent. The greater one's determination, the stronger one's subjective initiative. In 1959, the Guānjīashān Production Team of the Fùjiāhé Management Area of the Tiāntáng People's Commune had a drought resistance story of "building a ravine in the air": the 85 mu of "sky-gazing fields" of this production team under Shēnshuǐyán were about to dry up. In order to solve this problem, the Party branch convened a forum for experienced farmers. Zhu Zhùjūn, a 61-year-old commune member, offered a clever plan of "building a ravine on the cliff." Those who were prone to wavering and afraid of difficulties shook their heads as soon as they heard it, saying, "Shēnshuǐyán is more than a hundred zhang high, even birds and beasts can hardly stop there, how can people get up there?" However, Zhu Lao Han did not think so. Determined to do it, the next day he took dozens of zhang of rattan rope and climbed to the top of the rock with the Party branch secretary, hanging vines and hooking creepers. After a night and day of hard work, he built more than 80 zhang of sky ravine, saving 85 mu of seedlings and achieving a great harvest. Those who were originally afraid of difficulties praised: "Old man Zhu, you have determination. If everyone was like you, it would be possible to drive mountains and fill the sea." Doesn't this story vividly illustrate that where there's a will, there's a way?

Having foresight and determination will inevitably lead to the full utilization of human creativity. Creativity can also be said to be subjective initiative. Without creativity, there is no talk of exerting human subjective initiative. If people creatively use objective laws and fully utilize human subjective initiative, they can turn unfavorable conditions into favorable conditions, transform negative factors into positive factors, and create outstanding achievements. The Tiāntáng People's Commune is located in the highest area of the northeastern part of our province, surrounded by famous mountains more than 1,000 meters high. Sky-gazing fields account for 28% of the total arable land. There are few high mountain ponds and reservoirs, fearing both floods and droughts. However, the Tiāntáng People's Commune Party Committee fully mobilized the masses and used the objective law that "there is a lot of spring water in high mountains, and water flows to low places," creating automatic waterwheels, earthen pumps, aerial water transport, flowing water in houses, splitting mountains to divert water and other drought resistance methods, powerfully criticizing the right-leaning conservative ideas of "three resistances and three non-resistances" (resisting the near but not the far, resisting the good but not the bad, resisting the early rice but not the late rice) and the fear of difficulty, enabling more than 13,500 mu of drought-stricken land to achieve a great harvest, and the total grain output of the entire commune increased by more than 30% compared with 1958. Utilizing human creativity is not based on empty thinking, but on mastering and utilizing objective laws, constantly practicing, learning, summarizing, and improving while doing. Therefore, we say "practice produces knowledge, and knowledge creates miracles."

The Mass Movement Led by the Party is a Concentrated Manifestation of the Full Utilization of Subjective Initiative

Whether subjective initiative has been fully utilized depends on whether the mass movement led by the Party has been launched. Only when a vigorous and down-to-earth revolutionary mass movement is formed is it a concentrated manifestation of the full utilization of human subjective initiative. This is because the people are the creators of history. Countless facts prove that as long as it is based on the soaring energy and continuous revolution of the people, the great victory of all revolutionary causes can be guaranteed. The bourgeois viewpoint that only believes in the power of individuals or a few people and does not believe in the power of the masses must be strictly criticized. How can we ensure the healthy development of the revolutionary mass movement? The key lies in the leadership of the Party. The fact that Luótián won a great disaster and a great harvest in 1959 fully proves this truth. When the drought situation was not serious, some people were right-leaning, conservative, and paralyzed. Through the Party's active leadership and mobilization of the masses, the drought resistance movement quickly formed a climax. When the drought situation developed seriously and it was necessary to persist in drought resistance to the end, some people were pessimistic, saying, "Now the water source is exhausted, people are exhausted, and if it doesn't rain, it can't be resisted." Through the Party's active leadership and mobilization of the masses, the masses were determined to resist drought to the end, and the drought resistance movement moved to a new climax. When a little rain fell, some people were blindly optimistic, saying, "Now it's good, the rain has broken through, and there is no worry about no rain." Through the Party's active leadership and continued mobilization of the masses, the idea of relaxation and waiting for rain was overcome, and persistence in drought resistance to the end was insisted. Luótián was like this under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the provincial and regional Party committees, with the active efforts of all Party member cadres, constantly mobilizing the masses, greatly opposing right-leaning, greatly breaking "the theory of conditions only," greatly encouraging revolutionary enthusiasm, and fully exerting the subjective initiative of the people, thus winning the "great disaster and great harvest." How should the Party lead the mass movement and make the mass movement colorful? My deeper understanding is to grasp new things, make models, insert red flags, establish pacesetters, and vigorously engage in competition. Chairman Mao said: "In any place where there are masses, there are generally three parts: the more active, the intermediate, and the more backward. Therefore, leaders must be good at uniting a few active elements as the backbone of the leadership, and rely on this backbone to improve the intermediate elements and win over the backward elements." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Vol. 3, p. 900). Therefore, in practice, we must be good at discovering and cultivating advanced people and advanced deeds, and through effective methods such as inserting red flags, establishing pacesetters, visiting and comparing, and vigorously engaging in competition, drive the backward and promote the balanced development of the mass movement. The Dàqí People's Commune Party Committee, in the drought resistance movement, went deep into key areas, did a good job of experiments, personally took the lead, and established 17 special-class drought resistance models and one management area and five production teams of outstanding red flags, thus launching a mass-based competition movement of learning, comparing, catching up, and helping. At the same time, the commune Party committee seized the typical examples of great enthusiasm and many methods, timely convened on-site meetings, exchanged drought resistance experiences, promoted the drought resistance movement, made the movement continue to rise, and won a great harvest despite the great disaster. Facts prove that only by strengthening the Party's leadership can the mass movement be vigorous, and only with the mass movement can the revolutionary work achieve final victory.

    必须能动地改造世界
    ——对大灾大丰收的一点体会
    中共湖北罗田县委第一书记　刘德俊
    1959年，罗田人民驯服三次洪水、战胜百日大旱，取得了大灾大丰收的伟大胜利，正是人们依据客观规律充分发挥了主观能动性的结果。那么，如何才能充分发挥人的主观能动性呢？这就大有文章，我只能就“大灾大丰收”的事实，谈一些粗浅的体会。
    认真学习毛泽东思想，正确认识客观和主观的关系
    认真学习毛泽东思想，正确认识客观和主观的关系，这是充分发挥主观能动性的根本问题。毛主席说：“我们反对主观地看问题，说的是一个人的思想，不根据和不符合于客观事实，是空想，是假道理，如果照了做去，就要失败，故须反对它。但是一切事情是要人做的……做就必须先有人根据客观事实，引出思想、道理、意见，提出计划、方针、政策、战略、战术，方能做得好。思想等等是主观的东西，做或行动是主观见之于客观的东西，都是人类特殊的能动性。这种能动性，我们名之曰‘自觉的能动性’，是人之所以区别于物的特点。一切根据和符合于客观事实的思想是正确的思想，一切根据于正确思想的做或行动是正确的行动。我们必须发扬这样的思想和行动，必须发扬这种自觉的能动性。”毛主席这段话把客观和主观的关系说得一清二楚。客观和主观的关系，一方面是不以人们意志为转移的客观过程，一方面是人们按照自己的意志所进行的主观活动，而主观能动性必须在正确认识客观规律的基础上，才能充分发挥，如果把这两个方面分割开了，就会犯这样或那样的错误。
    人的主观能动性，固然要依据客观规律才能充分发挥，但不等于人在客观规律面前无能为力，如果认为“人被客观规律捆死了”，就会犯右倾机会主义的错误。毛主席教导我们：“马克思主义的哲学认为十分重要的问题，不在于懂得了客观世界的规律性，因而能够解释世界，而在于拿了这种对于客观规律性的认识去能动地改造世界。”（毛泽东选集第一卷280—281页）。列宁也说：“‘事在人为’，工人和农民应当把这个真理牢牢记住”（列宁全集第26卷第386页）。因此，人只有运用了客观规律，充分发挥了主观能动性，才会产生无穷无尽的力量。特别是在现时“一天等于二十年”的伟大时代里，只要我们遵循马克思列宁主义，高举毛泽东思想红旗，执行“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义”的总路线，在具备了一定的客观条件的情况下，人民群众的主观能动性就成为取得一切胜利的决定因素。广大人民群众那种斗志昂扬、意气风发的革命热情，那种“人定胜天”的坚强信念，那种要求迅速改变“一穷二白”的雄心壮志，那种“要高山低头，叫河水让路”的豪言壮语，那种敢说敢想敢干的共产主义风格，正是人的主观能动性起巨大作用的表现。从罗田“大灾大丰收”的事实来看，也充分的证明了这一点。1959年，罗田县委在省、地委直接领导下，带领全县群众与自然灾害作斗争的时候，遵照了毛主席的指示和总路线的精神，既强调和正确估计了人民群众的主观能动性，提出了“抗旱大跃进，大灾大丰收”，“棵苗必保，碗水必争，抗旱抗到底，不胜不收兵”的口号，也依据了当时当地的客观条件，先集中力量打好了第一个战役——保住了中稻；再集中力量打好了第二个战役——保住了晚稻。原来有些地方在抗旱斗争中，忽视了人的主观能动性，存在“靠天吃饭”的思想，经过学习毛泽东思想，武装了干部和群众以后，就形成了巨大的力量。在长期抗旱运动中，全县出动了十五万多抗旱大军，运用了三十六部抽水机和一万一千多部水车，大搞开源截流，开渠五到十华里的五十一处，十华里以上的二处，搬水二到五华里的一百一十八处。这样，除救住了一般的受旱田以外，还救住了二十七万四千四百多亩严重受旱的田地，赢得了“大灾大丰收”。全县1959年农副业总产值，比大跃进的1958年还增长近两成，粮食总产量在特大灾害的情况下，保住了1958年的跃进水平。这一切事实，都充分说明了“事在人为”、“人定胜天”是一条真理，只要充分发挥了人的主观能动性，客观规律可以充分利用，客观的不利条件可以迅速改变为有利的条件，而认为人在客观面前无能为力的观点，是非常错误的。
    当然，强调人的主观能动性的巨大作用，相信“事在人为”，并不是说人可以消灭客观规律，否认“客观第一性”这个根本原理。如果不顾客观规律而胡思乱想、盲目乱干，想在“天上摸鱼，海底捞月”，那就不能叫做充分发挥人的主观能动性，而是主观唯心主义。这样，也会一事无成。因此，我们在强调主观能动作用、相信“事在人为”的同时，也要反对主观唯心主义。如果我们不去组织出动十五万抗旱大军，不运用一万多部水车和三十几部抽水机，不修建那样多的水渠，就是说如果不依靠这些客观条件，不去充分发挥这些客观条件的作用，而只有战胜旱灾的愿望，也不可能得到“大灾大丰收”的结果。
    在实践中不断提高思想认识，遇事要有预见性、坚决性、创造性
    正确认识了客观和主观的关系，充分估计了人的主观能动作用，虽然是一个根本问题，但在具体实践过程中，还必须不断地提高思想认识，遇事要有预见性、坚决性、创造性。人的主观能动性总是和一定的预见性分不开的，只有了解事物发展变化的趋向，预见到行动的后果，人们在实践中的行动才是自觉的。要做到这一点，就必须掌握客观事物的发展规律，对客观规律认识得愈深刻，就愈能有远大的科学预见，实践中的盲目性就愈少，主观能动性也就愈大。1959年，骆驼?公社党委在领导群众接连战胜三次大洪灾之后，就预见到“久雨必有久晴，大洪必有大旱”，于是，他们通过各种方法，提早动员和组织干部群众，抢修抗旱工具，撮好拦河堰、水车灌塘灌田，并把龙王岩水库的大干渠加深加宽。可是，一些有右倾保守思想的人，却不了解事物发展的趋向，没有科学预见，所以一听到党委提出防旱的口号就抵触起来。公社党委针对这种思想，通过算账对比等办法，向广大干部和群众讲明了“有旱早抗，无旱早防”和“有备无患”的道理，在抗旱上打了主动仗，更好地发挥了人的主观能动性。全公社只一个多月的时间，就抢修山洪冲毁的河堰等小型水利工程三千六百三十四处，车水灌塘四百八十三口，扩大灌溉面积三万一千多亩，获得了大灾大丰收。全公社粮食总产量，比大跃进的1958年还增产12.5％。看来，做事要有预见性这点非常重要。但这并不是说，人们必须把未来事情的一切方面都了解得清清楚楚以后，才能开始行动。毛主席说：“马克思主义者不是算命先生，未来的发展和变化，只应该也只能说出个大的方向，不应该也不可能机械地规定时日。”（毛泽东选集第一卷110页）。正确的行动固然要正确的认识作指导，但正确的认识总要通过实践才能逐步提高，最后达到完善。因此，要提高科学预见能力，除了依靠自己的科学知识以外，最重要的还是依靠实践。毛主席在实践论中提出：“实践、认识、再实践、再认识，这种形式，循环往复以至无穷，而实践和认识之每一循环的内容，都比较地进到了高一级的程度。”如果我们不懂得这个道理，那不仅不利于发挥主观能动性，反而还大大束缚了人的主观能动性。
    有了科学的预见性，就有了必胜的初步信念，但在实际行动中还会碰到许多阻力，所以还必须有坚决性。所谓坚决性也就是革命的彻底性。毛主席讲的“愚公移山”的故事，就充分说明了坚决性的重要，俗话说的“只要有决心，铁杵磨成针”、“天下无难事，只怕有心人”，也说明了这个道理。因此，主观能动性和坚决性是一致的，谁的坚决性越大，谁的主观能动性也就越强。1959年，天堂人民公社傅家河管理区关家山生产队，有个“空中造涧”的抗旱故事：这个生产队的深水岩下，有八十五亩“望天丘”秧苗快要干死了。为了解决这个难题，党支部召开了老农座谈会，六十一岁的老年社员朱祝君在会上献了一条“悬岩搭涧”的妙计，那些动摇成性、见难就怕的人，一听说直摆头，说“深水岩一百多丈高，鸟兽也难停脚，人怎么上得去呢？”可是，朱老汉并不以为然，坚决要干，第二天他带了几十丈长的藤索，同党支部书记一路，攀藤挂葛地爬上了岩顶，把藤索一头系在树上，一头系在腰上，苦战了一昼夜，顺岩搭起了八十多丈天涧，救活了八十五亩秧苗，并得到了大丰收。原来那些见难就怕的人也夸奖：“朱老汉，有决心，人人都像你一样，赶山填海也能行。”这个故事不是生动地说明了有志者事竟成吗？
    有了预见性和坚决性，也就必然能够充分发挥人的创造性。创造性也可以说是主观能动性，没有创造性，就谈不上发挥人的主观能动性。人如果创造性地运用了客观规律，充分发挥了人的主观能动性，就可以变不利条件为有利条件，化消极因素为积极因素，创造出优异的成绩。天堂人民公社处于我省东北部的最高地带，周围都是一千多米的著名大山，望天丘占总田面积28％。高山塘堰少，怕洪又怕旱，可是，天堂人民公社党委充分发动群众，运用了“高山泉水多，水往低处流”的客观规律，创造了自动翻水车、土抽水机、空中运水、屋中流水、劈山引水等等抗旱办法，有力地批判了“三抗三不抗”（抗近不抗远，抗好不抗坏，抗早稻不抗晚稻）的右倾保守思想和畏难情绪，使一万三千五百多亩受旱田得到了大丰收，全公社粮食总产量比1958年增产了30％多。发挥人的创造性不是凭空想，而是要掌握和利用客观规律，不断实践，边做、边学、边总结、边提高。所以我们说“实践出认识，认识创奇迹。”
    党所领导的群众运动是主观能动性充分发挥的集中表现
    主观能动性是不是充分的发挥了，要看党所领导下的群众运动是不是搞开了，只有形成了轰轰烈烈扎扎实实的革命群众运动，才是人的主观能动性充分发挥的集中表现。这是因为人民群众是历史的创造者，无数事实证明，只要是在人民群众的冲天干劲和不断革命的基础上，就能保证一切革命事业的伟大胜利。那种只相信个人或少数人的力量而不相信群众力量的资产阶级观点，必须严格批判。如何才能保证革命群众运动的健康发展呢？关键在于党的领导，我们罗田1959年夺得大灾大丰收的事实完全证明了这一真理。当旱情还不严重的时候，有些人右倾保守、麻痹松气，通过党的积极领导和发动群众，抗旱运动就很快形成高潮；当旱情发展严重，正需要坚持抗旱到底的时候，又有些人消极悲观，说“现在水源尽了，人累死，天不下雨也抗不住”，通过党的积极领导和发动群众，使群众坚定了抗旱到底的信心，抗旱运动又走向了新的高潮；当落了一点小雨的时候，又有些人盲目乐观，说：“现在好了，雨落破了就不愁无雨”，通过党的积极领导和继续发动群众，克服了松气等雨的思想，坚持了抗旱到底。罗田就是这样在党中央和省、地委的正确领导下，在全体党员干部积极努力的条件下，不断地发动群众，大反右倾，大破“唯条件论”，大鼓革命干劲，充分发挥了人的主观能动作用，才夺取了“大灾大丰收”。党应该怎样领导群众运动、把群众运动搞得有声有色呢？我体会比较深刻的是要抓新事、做样板、插红旗、树标兵、大闹竞赛。毛主席说：“任何有群众的地方，大致都有比较积极的、中间状态的和比较落后的三部分人。故领导者必须善于团结少数积极分子作为领导的骨干，并凭借这批骨干去提高中间分子，争取落后分子”（毛泽东选集第三卷900页）。因此，我们在实践中，要善于发现和培养先进人、先进事，通过插红旗、树标兵、参观评比、大闹竞赛等等有效方法，带动后进，促进群众运动的平衡发展。大崎人民公社党委在抗旱运动中，深入重点，搞好试验，亲自带头，并树立了十七个特等抗旱模范和一个管理区、五个生产队的突出红旗，从而开展了群众性的学、比、赶、帮的竞赛运动。同时，公社党委抓住干劲大、办法多的典型，及时召开了现场会，交流了抗旱经验，推动了抗旱运动，使运动不断高涨，夺得了大灾大丰收。事实证明，只有加强党的领导，才能使群众运动搞得轰轰烈烈，只有群众运动，才能使革命工作取得最后胜利。
