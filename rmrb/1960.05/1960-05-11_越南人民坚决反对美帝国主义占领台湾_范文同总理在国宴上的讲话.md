Respected Comrade Premier, Comrade Vice Premier, Comrades, Friends:
    On behalf of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, I extend my cordial respect to Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Chen Yi, and all the comrades accompanying them, and extend my sincere congratulations to the most beloved comrades, friends, and brothers of the Vietnamese people.
    Comrade Premier's visit to our country comes at a time when our people have just re-elected National Assembly representatives in accordance with the new constitution, and when we are working hard to complete the three-year national plan and actively preparing to enter the first five-year plan, with the aim of completing the socialist transformation and further promoting the cause of socialist construction. We welcome you with the joyful mood of having already achieved victory and looking forward to the arrival of greater victories.
    Respected Comrade Premier,
    It has only been a little over three years since your last visit to Vietnam, but there have been tremendous developments in our two countries, and changes in the world that are favorable to the cause of peace, democracy, national independence, and socialism.
    The Vietnamese people are very pleased with China's great achievements in socialist construction under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. The General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune movement are promoting China's development in all aspects, and the Chinese people are moving forward at a speed that is unimaginable under any other system. The miracles created by China have made important contributions to the strengthening of socialist forces and to the treasure trove of socialist construction experience, and have inspired oppressed nations and economically underdeveloped countries to build their own independent economy and happy life with confidence and enthusiasm.
    During the past period, under the leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party and President Ho Chi Minh, all the people of Vietnam have been vigorously developing revolutionary vigor to build socialism in the North and to fight for the reunification of the motherland. Socialist transformation is proceeding steadily and actively, socialist construction is developing smoothly, and the people's lives are being further improved.
    Since the restoration of peace, China's selfless and valuable assistance has played an extremely important role in Vietnam's economic and cultural development. During the economic recovery period, China helped us quickly repair railways, irrigation systems, and many factories, and also provided a large number of consumer goods to stabilize prices and ensure the people's livelihood. In the years of economic development, China has helped us establish agricultural product processing industries, which were almost non-existent in Vietnam in the past, as well as some factories that manufacture daily consumer goods. At present, China is helping us lay the initial foundation for the metallurgical industry and the chemical industry, and is also building and expanding some electric power industry enterprises. Of the 72 factories aided by China, 31 have been completed and put into production. In agriculture, China has helped us establish some farms for growing tropical cash crops and raising livestock, opening up broad avenues for the comprehensive development of agriculture. China has also helped us build many water conservancy projects, established the Bac Hung Hai large-scale irrigation system, and is currently helping us study plans for thoroughly harnessing and developing the Red River. In developing trade between the two countries, China has constantly sought to help us increase exports and has tried its best to meet our import requirements. This kind of help can only be achieved in trade relations between fraternal countries. There is also China's valuable assistance in other economic sectors, as well as in culture, health, education, and other departments.
    The Vietnamese people will always remember the deep kindness of the Chinese people in their hearts. On this occasion, I would like to express the Vietnamese people's gratitude to the Chinese expert comrades, who have a noble spirit of proletarian internationalism, who wholeheartedly help us develop our economy and culture, build new projects, train cadres and workers, and wholeheartedly impart to us the necessary skills, so that we can gradually and truly establish our own economy, culture, and new life.
    The Vietnamese people deeply realize that Vietnam's socialist construction cannot be separated from the sincere assistance of the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries.
    Comrades, friends,
    At present, the world peace and progressive forces, with the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union as the backbone, have greatly exceeded the forces of imperialism and war. Due to the invincible strength and peaceful policy of the Soviet Union and the socialist camp, the recent international situation has eased to a certain extent. The Soviet Union's proposal for complete and thorough disarmament, its reasonable and practical proposals for resolving major international disputes, and all its diplomatic activities reflect Lenin's great policy of peaceful coexistence and have won the sympathy and warm support of the people of the world.
    The People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union have consistently pursued a peaceful foreign policy, followed the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and continuously strengthened their unity with countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, strengthened their unity with peace-loving people all over the world, and at the same time resolutely exposed and opposed the US imperialist policies of aggression and war.
    The Vietnamese people and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam warmly approve and support the peaceful and friendly policy of the People's Republic of China, and approve and support the Chinese government's proposal that all countries in Asia and the Pacific region conclude a peace pact of mutual non-aggression and turn this region into a nuclear-free zone.
    The Vietnamese people and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are willing to wage unremitting struggle to make their own contribution to the cause of defending peace in Indochina, Southeast Asia, and the world. We will make every effort to strengthen friendship and cooperation in all aspects with neighboring countries, Asian and African countries, and all countries in the world, in the spirit of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.
    While the socialist camp and the peace-loving people of the world are making unremitting efforts for a solid and lasting peace, US imperialism continues to pursue its policy of strength and war preparation, strengthens the arms race, enhances the activities of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc, the Southeast Asian aggressive bloc, and the Central aggressive bloc, revives West German and Japanese militarism, suppresses national liberation movements, interferes in the internal affairs of various countries, and provokes relations between countries. Recently, US imperialism blatantly created tensions, attempting to undermine the upcoming summit conference, evade solving mature international problems, and maintain a cold war atmosphere.
    The Vietnamese people, together with the peace-loving people of the world, warmly welcome the resolute and forceful attitude taken by the Soviet Union towards the US reconnaissance plane's violation of Soviet airspace on May 1. This is the proper attitude towards aggressors and warmongers. The Vietnamese people resolutely oppose US imperialism's occupation of Taiwan and its clinging to the corpse of Chiang Kai-shek, attempting to create "two Chinas," and believe that the Chinese people's struggle to achieve territorial integrity and defend their sovereignty will surely achieve brilliant victory. The Vietnamese people sympathize with the Chinese people in condemning US imperialism's efforts to revive Japanese militarism, condemning the US-Japan "Security Treaty," and believe that this is a serious threat to peace and stability in Asia and the Pacific.
    The Vietnamese people fully support the South Korean people's continuing heroic struggle against the South Korean police system—a tool of US imperialism.
    As a party to the Geneva Agreements on Laos and a neighbor of the Kingdom of Laos, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam cannot but be concerned about the Lao situation, which remains tense and full of crisis due to the deepening interference of US imperialism. This interference is a constant threat to the tranquility of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The Vietnamese people and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam continue to struggle, demanding the implementation of the Geneva Agreements and the Vientiane Agreements to normalize the Lao situation and strengthen the friendly relations between the two neighboring countries.
    All the Vietnamese people must unite as one to fight for the reunification of the motherland and against US imperialism's policies of aggression and war in South Vietnam. We sternly accuse US imperialism and its running dogs of constantly increasing the military personnel of the US Military Assistance Advisory Group, constantly strengthening armaments, and paving the way for the open entry of US troops into South Vietnam in preparation for launching a new war of dangerous conspiracy. We demand that the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference and the member states of the International Commission must take active measures to ensure the strict implementation of the Geneva Agreements and safeguard peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia.
    Comrades, friends,
    Our era is the era of victory for the cause of world peace, democracy, national independence, and socialism. We warmly welcome Comrade Khrushchev's forceful speech at the Soviet Supreme Soviet meeting on May 5: "Imperialism cannot stop the development of socialist countries, socialist countries are confidently moving towards the bright future of mankind—communism."
    Indeed, the Soviet people are victoriously building communism on a large scale, and the Chinese people and the people of other socialist countries are taking great strides on the road of building socialism.
    Imperialism also cannot stem the tide of national liberation, which is rising unprecedentedly in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. They also cannot stem the struggle of millions of people around the world for peace and friendship and against aggression and war. At the Soviet Supreme Soviet meeting, Khrushchev correctly pointed out that "imperialism sharpens the international situation, creates various crises, and phenomena that endanger the cause of peace, which will arouse the anger of the people and dig their own graves."
Comrades, friends,
    Our cause of building socialism is a noble cause. Our struggle for peace and national independence is a just struggle. Our strength is the strength of the entire world that is developing. We are filled with excitement and firm confidence in our great cause.
    In accordance with the above spirit, we once again express our warm welcome to our distinguished guests, our close friends: Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Chen Yi, and the comrades accompanying them. We congratulate the fraternal and close friendly relations between the Vietnamese people and the Chinese people, and between the people of all countries in the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.
    We toast the health of Chairman Mao Zedong, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, and President Ho Chi Minh,
    We toast the health of Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi,
    We toast peace and friendship between Asian countries and all countries in the world,
    Cheers!

    越南人民坚决反对美帝国主义占领台湾
    范文同总理在国宴上的讲话敬爱的总理同志，副总理同志，同志们，朋友们：
    我谨代表越南劳动党中央委员会和越南民主共和国政府向周恩来总理，陈毅副总理和随行全体同志们致以亲切的敬意，向越南人民最爱戴的同志、朋友和兄弟致以诚挚的祝贺。
    这次总理同志访问我国，正当我国人民按照新宪法刚改选国会代表，正当我们努力完成三年国家计划，为跨进第一个五年计划积极的作好准备，旨在完成社会主义改造和进一步促进社会主义建设事业。我们以已经获得的胜利并展望着更大的胜利的到来的愉快心情来迎接你们。
    敬爱的总理同志，
    自从你前次访问越南以来，不过是三年多的时间，但在我们两个国家却有了巨大的发展，在世界上也发生了有利于和平、民主、民族独立和社会主义事业的变化。
    对于中国人民在中国共产党和毛主席领导下进行的社会主义建设所取得的伟大成就，越南人民感到非常高兴。总路线、大跃进、人民公社运动正在促进中国在各方面的发展，中国人民以在任何其他制度下都不能设想的速度向前迈进。中国所创造的这些奇迹对社会主义力量的增强、对社会主义建设经验宝库作出了重要贡献，并鼓舞被压迫民族及经济不发达的国家满怀信心地、兴致勃勃地建设自己的独立经济和幸福生活。
    在过去期间内，越南全体人民在越南劳动党和胡志明主席的领导下，正大力发挥革命干劲来建设北方的社会主义和为祖国统一而斗争。社会主义改造正稳步地、积极地进行，社会主义建设正顺利地发展，人民的生活得到进一步的提高。
    和平恢复以来，中国的无私的宝贵的援助，对越南的经济文化发展起着极其重大的作用。在经济恢复时期，中国帮助我们迅速修复铁路线、灌溉系统以及许多工厂，并且援助了大批生活消费品以稳定物价，保障人民的生活。在经济发展的几年中，中国帮助我们建立起过去在越南几乎是没有的农产品加工工业以及一些制造日用消费品的工厂。目前，中国帮助我们初步打下了冶金工业、化学工业基础，并且增建和扩建一些电力工业企业。由中国援助的七十二个工厂，其中有三十一个已建成，并已投入生产。在农业方面，中国帮助我们建立了一些种植热带经济作物和饲养牲畜的农牧场，为全面的发展农业开辟了宽广的道路。中国还帮助我们兴建了许多水利工程，建立了北兴海大型灌溉系统，目前正在帮助我们研究根治和开发红河的规划。在发展两国的贸易方面，中国经常地设法帮助我们增加出口量，并且尽量地满足我们的进口要求，这种帮助只有在兄弟的国家的贸易关系上才能做到的。在其他经济部门以及文化、卫生、教育等部门中都有着中国宝贵的援助。
    越南人民把中国人民的深厚恩情永远牢记在心里。借此机会，我特地向具有崇高的无产阶级国际主义精神的兄弟，中国专家同志们表达越南人民的谢意，他们全力地帮助我们发展经济、文化，修建新的工程，培养干部、工人，一心一意地传授给我们必要的本领，使我们逐步地真正建立起自己的经济、文化和新生活。
    越南人民深刻的认识到，越南的社会主义建设事业离不开苏联、中国和其它社会主义国家的真诚援助。
    同志们、朋友们，
    目前，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营为骨干的世界和平和进步力量已大大地超过了帝国主义和战争势力的力量。由于苏联和社会主义阵营的无敌力量和和平政策，最近国际局势已经有一定程度的和缓。苏联关于全面、彻底裁军的建议，为解决国际的主要争端提出的合理切实的建议以及苏联的全部外交活动反映了列宁伟大的和平共处政策，并得到世界人民的同情与热烈支持。
    中华人民共和国和苏联一贯地奉行和平外交政策，遵照和平共处五项原则，不断地增强与亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国的团结，增强与全世界爱好和平人民的团结，同时坚决地揭穿和反对美帝国主义的侵略和战争政策。
    越南人民和越南民主共和国政府热烈赞成和支持中华人民共和国的和平友好政策，赞成和支持中国政府关于建议亚洲和太平洋地区的所有国家缔结互不侵犯的和平公约、把这地区变为无原子区的主张。
    越南人民和越南民主共和国政府愿进行不懈的斗争来为保卫印度支那、东南亚和世界和平的事业作出自己的贡献。我们尽一切努力本着和平共处五项原则加强同邻国、亚洲、非洲各国以及世界上所有国家的友谊和各方面的合作。
    当社会主义阵营和世界爱好和平的人民为了牢固的、持久的和平进行不懈的努力的时候，美帝国主义却继续奉行其实力和备战的政策，加强军备竞赛，增强北大西洋侵略集团、东南亚侵略集团和中央侵略集团的活动，复活西德和日本的军国主义，镇压民族解放运动，干涉各国内政，挑拨各国的关系。最近美帝国主义露骨地制造紧张局势，企图破坏即将召开的最高级会议，回避解决已经成熟了的国际问题，维持冷战气氛。
    越南人民同世界爱好和平人民一起，热烈欢迎苏联对于美国侦察机5月1日侵犯苏联领空所采取的坚决和强硬的态度。这是对侵略者、好战分子的应有的态度。越南人民坚决反对美帝国主义占领台湾和死死地抓住蒋介石这具僵尸，企图制造“两个中国”，并相信中国人民为实现领土完整和保卫自己的主权的斗争一定取得辉煌的胜利。越南人民同情中国人民谴责美帝国主义竭力复活日本军国主义，谴责日美“安全条约”，并认为这是对亚洲和太平洋的和平的严重威胁。
    越南人民全力支持南朝鲜人民继续反对南朝鲜的警察制度——美帝国主义的工具的英勇的斗争。
    作为签订关于老挝的日内瓦协议的一方和老挝王国的邻国，越南民主共和国不能不关心由于美帝国主义日益加深的干涉而仍然紧张和充满危机的老挝局势。这种干涉是对越南民主共和国的安宁的经常性的威胁。越南人民和越南民主共和国继续斗争，要求履行日内瓦协议和万象协议来使老挝局势正常化，加强两个邻国的友谊关系。
    全体越南人民要团结一致，为实现祖国的统一和反对美帝国主义在南越的侵略和战争政策而进行斗争。我们严厉控告美帝国主义和它的走狗不断加强美国军事援助顾问团的军事人员，不断加强军备，为美军公开进入南越打开道路以准备发动新战争的危险阴谋。我们要求日内瓦会议两位主席和国际委员会成员国必须采取积极措施，以保障日内瓦协议的严正履行，维护印度支那和东南亚的和平。
    同志们，朋友们，
    我们的时代是世界和平、民主、民族独立和社会主义事业胜利的时代。我们热烈欢迎赫鲁晓夫同志5月5日在苏联最高苏维埃会议上强硬的发言：“帝国主义阻挡不了社会主义国家的发展，社会主义国家正满怀信心地向着人类光明的未来——共产主义前进。”
    确实如此，苏联人民正在胜利地、大规模地建设共产主义，中国人民和其他社会主义国家人民正在建设社会主义的道路上跨着巨大的步伐。
    帝国主义也遏止不了亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的正在空前地高涨的民族解放浪潮。它们也遏止不了千百万世界人民争取和平和友谊、反对侵略和战争的斗争。在苏联最高苏维埃会议上，赫鲁晓夫正确地指出，“帝国主义使国际局势尖锐化，制造各种危机和危害和平事业的现象，这就会引起人民的愤怒而自掘坟墓。”
    同志们，朋友们，
    我们建设社会主义的事业是高贵的事业。我们为和平和民族独立的斗争是正义的斗争。我们的力量是正在发展中的整个世界的力量。我们对我们伟大的事业充满兴奋和坚定的信心。
    按照上述精神，我们再一次表示热烈欢迎贵宾们，我们亲密的朋友：周恩来总理、陈毅副总理和随行的同志们。我们祝贺越南人民和中国人民之间的、以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国人民之间的兄弟般亲密的友好关系。
    我们为毛泽东主席、刘少奇主席和胡志明主席的健康，
    我们为周恩来总理和陈毅副总理的健康，
    我们为亚洲各国和全世界各国之间的和平、友好，
    干杯！
