Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 17th: The Japanese "Asahi Shimbun" published an article on the 16th exposing the vile relationship between members of the ruling party of Japan, the Liberal Democratic Party, and fascist violent groups.

The article states that it is very common to find the names of prominent Liberal Democratic Party Diet members on circular letters of swindling vendors, gamblers, and violent groups, as well as on invitation cards for funerals and weddings. When a violent group called "Hayano Association" in Osaka held a head succession ceremony on March 26, the invitation cards issued by this violent group were printed with the names of five current Japanese cabinet ministers and Liberal Democratic Party Diet members.

The article revealed that when a gathering of swindling vendor groups in Tokyo was held at "Yasukuni Shrine" on May 9, Eiichi Tanaka, former Superintendent-General of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department and Liberal Democratic Party Diet member, attended and spoke. Not long ago, the Tokyo City Youth Department of the Liberal Democratic Party invited Nobusuke Kishi to attend an evening party held in Tokyo. The planner of the entertainment program for this party was Saburo Shiga, the central branch manager of the "Matsuba-kai," who recently became notorious for attacking the "Mainichi Shimbun." The article stated that when thugs from violent groups are arrested by the police, it is Liberal Democratic Party Diet members who go to the police to request bail, and the more local the area, the more frequent this situation becomes.

The article pointed out that Liberal Democratic Party Diet members often use the organizations of violent groups to gather votes for themselves. Some members of local councils are also elected through the organizations of violent groups.

    日本“朝日新闻”载文揭露
    自由民主党与暴力团体狼狈为奸
    据新华社17日讯　东京消息：日本“朝日新闻”16日发表文章，揭露日本执政党——自由民主党议员同法西斯暴力团体的丑恶关系。
    文章说，在骗人摊贩、赌徒和暴力团体的传阅信上和葬礼、喜事请帖上发现顶顶有名的自由民主党国会议员的名字，是很平常的事。大阪一个叫做“早野会”的暴力团体在3月26日举行头目继任仪式时，由这个暴力团体发出的请帖上就印有现任日本内阁大臣和自由民主党国会议员共五人的名字。
    文章揭露，东京的骗人摊贩团体5月9日在“靖国神社”举行集会时，前日本警视总监、自由民主党议员田中荣一到会讲了话。自由民主党东京市青年部不久以前邀请岸信介出席在东京举行的一次晚会，这个晚会文艺节目的计划人竟是最近以袭击“每日新闻”社而臭名远扬的“松叶会”的中央支部长志贺三郎。文章说，暴力团体的暴徒们被警察逮捕时，到警察机关去请求保释的都是自由民主党议员，而且愈到地方，这样的情况就愈多。
    文章指出，自由民主党议员还常常利用暴力团体的组织为自己搜罗选票。地方议会有部分议员也是靠暴力团体的组织而当选的。
