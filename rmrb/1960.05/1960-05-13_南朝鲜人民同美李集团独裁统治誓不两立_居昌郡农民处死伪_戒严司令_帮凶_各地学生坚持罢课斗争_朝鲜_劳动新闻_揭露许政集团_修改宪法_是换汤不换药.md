    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 12th: Seoul Dispatch: The flames of South Korean people's opposition to the US-Lee group's fascist terror rule have spread to remote mountain and rural areas. On the evening of the 11th, more than 70 peasants from Sinwon Township, Geochang County, Gyeongsangnam-do, rose up to avenge their compatriots who died in the 1952 "Geochang Massacre," executing Park Young-bo (transliteration), the executioner who assisted Song Yo-chan – the then puppet township head (i.e., district head).

    According to South Korean news agencies, at 9 p.m. that night, more than 70 family members of the victims of the "Geochang Massacre" from Wolong-ri, Jungyu-ri, and Daehyeon-ri in Sinwon Township, angrily went to Park Young-bo's house in Yangji-ri, destroyed all his belongings, and then executed Park Young-bo on the spot. Upon hearing the news, the South Korean puppet authorities dispatched the Geochang County "Police Station" chief and eight police officers, along with eighteen soldiers, to suppress the uprising. However, the extremely angry masses continued to fight tenaciously and personally punished the murderer.

    The number one executioner who manufactured the "Geochang Massacre" is the current South Korean puppet "Army Chief of Staff" and "Martial Law Commander," Song Yo-chan. At that time, Song Yo-chan was attacking the People's Guerrillas in the Gyeongsangnam-do area and suffered heavy blows from the patriotic people's guerrillas. In February 1952, on the 15th day of the first lunar month, Song Yo-chan and Kim Jong-won, the puppet "Gyeongnam Area Martial Law Commander," colluded to dispatch the 9th Regiment of the puppet 11th Division to ambush around the Sinwon Township National School in Geochang County in advance. Then, they forced local residents to go to the school to listen to the so-called "current affairs speeches." When more than two thousand innocent residents gathered in the school, Song Yo-chan openly ordered the firing on these unarmed residents, even using mortars to bombard them. These executioners brutally killed all more than two thousand residents, and then poured gasoline on the corpses and burned them.

    This heroic action of the peasants in Geochang County shows that the day is not far off when the blood-stained chief executioner, Song Yo-chan, will be punished by the people.

    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 12th: Seoul Dispatch: Students in various regions of South Korea are continuing to fiercely launch struggles to expel US-Lee special agents and loyalists from schools.

    According to the World News Agency, more than 400 students from the Medical Department of Chonnam University in Gwangju began an indefinite strike today at noon, demanding that loyalist professors who colluded with Syngman Rhee's Liberal Party get out of the school.

    According to a broadcast by Daegu Radio Station, students from Osung High School in Daegu City also launched a strike struggle, demanding that US-Lee special agents in the school get out. Teachers at the school also held a meeting and passed a resolution demanding that the US-Lee special agent principal step down.

    According to Donghwa News Agency, more than 500 students from Sookmyung Women's University in Seoul, who began a sit-in demonstration struggle during the day on the 11th, continued their struggle in classrooms until around 10 p.m. that night. They constantly shouted slogans such as "Loyalist scholar Kim Doo-heon resign as president!"

    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 12th: The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published an editorial today, saying that the "constitutional amendment" farce played by the Heo Jeong Group under the manipulation of US imperialism is a deception and insult to the South Korean people.

    The commentary pointed out that the so-called "Constitutional Amendment Drafting Committee" of the South Korean puppet "National Assembly" formally submitted the so-called "Constitutional Amendment" to the puppet "National Assembly" on the 11th, using the names of so-called "national administration renovation" and "reform" to deceive and confuse the people. This thoroughly exposed the vicious conspiracy of the South Korean reactionary ruling group to maintain and prolong the US colonial ruling apparatus – the Syngman Rhee group's fascist terror rule system.

    The commentary pointed out that it is imaginable what can be produced from this garbage can of the "corrupt National Assembly," which has been unanimously criticized by the South Korean people. The essence of this "constitutional amendment" is a replica of the current Syngman Rhee "Constitution."

    The commentary said that the South Korean people waged a bloody struggle for freedom and democratic rights and overthrew the Syngman Rhee puppet government. However, this so-called "constitutional amendment" only made some verbal changes to the clauses in the Syngman Rhee "Constitution" that suppressed and obliterated the people's freedom and rights, but in essence, it is still the same. For example, this puppet "National Assembly" declared in the "constitutional amendment" that "all citizens shall have unrestricted freedom of speech, publication, and freedom of assembly and association." However, another clause states that "all freedoms and rights of citizens shall be restricted by law in order to maintain order and public welfare." It also fabricated clauses for the activities of political parties and organizations, such as "when the purpose and activities of a political party violate the basic order of the democratic constitution, the constitutional court shall make a judgment based on the government's prosecution and order the dissolution of the political party." The commentary pointed out that this so-called "constitutional amendment" also stipulates that citizens over the age of twenty have the right to vote. The South Korean reactionary ruling group is trying to exclude the broad masses of young people who stand at the forefront of the struggle against fascist rule and for democracy and freedom from political life.

    The commentary said that the South Korean puppet "National Assembly," as a tool of the US-Lee group's fascist terror rule, has approved and manufactured a series of treasonous treaties and fascist decrees, committing indelible crimes against the country and the people. They are simply not qualified to talk about "constitutional amendments."

    The commentary emphasized that as long as the US imperialist aggressors still occupy South Korea and its puppet group's terror rule has not been abolished, whether it is a "presidential responsibility system" or a "cabinet responsibility system," it cannot change the treacherous and anti-people nature of its regime.

    The commentary concluded by saying that now the South Korean people are shouting the slogans "Down with corrupt politics" and "Dissolve the dirty National Assembly," igniting even more intense flames of struggle. The demands of the people are irresistible. The South Korean people will never allow US imperialism and its puppets to support and prolong the conspiracy of fascist terror rule. In order to completely abolish the US-Lee group's fascist ruling apparatus, immediately dissolve the puppet "National Assembly," establish a temporary administrative institution composed of representatives of workers, peasants, youth, students and other sectors of the people, and realize a new politics, a new system, and a new life, they are fighting more bravely.

### 南朝鲜人民同美李集团独裁统治誓不两立  居昌郡农民处死伪“戒严司令”帮凶　各地学生坚持罢课斗争  朝鲜“劳动新闻”揭露许政集团“修改宪法”是换汤不换药

    南朝鲜人民同美李集团独裁统治誓不两立
    居昌郡农民处死伪“戒严司令”帮凶　各地学生坚持罢课斗争
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”揭露许政集团“修改宪法”是换汤不换药 
    新华社平壤12日电　汉城消息：南朝鲜人民反对美李集团法西斯恐怖统治的烈火已经烧到了偏僻的山区农村。11日晚上，庆尚南道居昌郡新院面的农民七十多人奋起为1952年“居昌大惨案”的死难同胞报仇，把制造这一惨案的刽子手、宋尧赞的帮凶——当时的伪面长（即区长）朴英甫（译音）处死。
    据南朝鲜的通讯社报道，这天晚上九时，新院面卧龙里、中榆里、大岘里的七十多名“居昌大惨案”死者的家属，愤怒地来到阳地里朴英甫的家中，把他家中的东西全部捣毁，然后又把朴英甫当场处死。南朝鲜伪傀儡当局闻讯曾调派居昌郡“警察署”署长等八名警官和十八名士兵赶去镇压。但是极度愤怒的群众继续顽强地进行斗争，并且亲手惩办了杀人的凶手。
    制造“居昌大惨案”的头号刽子手是现任南朝鲜伪“陆军参谋总长”、“戒严司令”宋尧赞。当时宋尧赞正在庆尚南道一带进攻人民游击队，受到了爱国人民的游击队的沉重的打击。1952年2月，农历正月15日，宋尧赞和伪“庆南地区戒严司令官”金钟元共谋调派伪十一师团第九联队事先埋伏在居昌郡神院面国民学校的周围，然后强迫当地居民到学校里去听所谓“时事演讲”。当二千多名无辜的居民聚集在学校里以后，宋尧赞公然下令向这些手无寸铁的居民开枪，竟至用迫击炮轰击。这些刽子手残暴地把二千多居民全部打死后，还在尸体上浇上汽油焚烧。
    这次居昌郡农民们的英勇行动说明，血债累累的大刽子手宋尧赞受到人民惩办的日子也不远了。
    新华社平壤12日电　汉城消息：南朝鲜各地学生们继续激烈地展开驱逐美李特务和御用分子出校的斗争。
    据世界通讯社报道，光州全南大学医学系四百多名学生从今天中午开始举行了无限期的罢课，要求同李承晚的自由党相勾结的御用教授们滚出学校。
    另据大丘广播电台广播，大丘市的五成高等学校的学生也展开罢课斗争，要这个学校中的美李特务分子滚出去。这个学校的教员也开会通过决议，要美李特务校长下台。
    据同和通讯社报道，11日白天开始举行静坐示威斗争的汉城淑明女子大学的学生，直到这一天夜晚十时左右，还有五百多人在教室里坚持斗争。她们不断激昂地高呼“御用学者金斗宪辞去校长的职务！”等口号。
    新华社平壤12日电　朝鲜“劳动新闻”今天发表编辑部评论说，在美帝国主义操纵下的许政集团玩弄的“修改宪法”丑剧，是对南朝鲜人民的愚弄和侮辱。
    评论指出，南朝鲜傀儡“国会”的所谓“宪法修正案起草委员会”11日正式向傀儡“国会”提出了所谓
  “宪法修正案”，以所谓“国政刷新”、“改革”等名目来欺骗和迷惑人民。这彻底地暴露了南朝鲜反动统治集团要维持和延长美国殖民统治机构——李承晚集团法西斯恐怖统治制度的恶毒阴谋。
    评论指出，这个被南朝鲜人民一致指责为“腐败的国会”的垃圾箱里能够产生出什么东西来是可以想像的。这个“宪法修正案”的本质，就是现行的李承晚“宪法”的翻版。
    评论说，南朝鲜人民为了争取自由和民主权利进行了流血斗争，打倒了李承晚傀儡政府。但是，这个所谓“宪法修正案”对李承晚“宪法”中镇压和抹杀人民的自由和权利的条款，只作了某些字句上的变化，本质上却还是一样。比如这个傀儡“国会”在“宪法修正案”中宣布“所有国民都不受限制的有言论、出版的自由和集会、结社的自由”。但是在另一条款中又说“国民的一切自由和权利在为了维持秩序和公共福利的情况下要受到法律的限制”。对于政党、团体的活动也制造了什么“某政党的目的和活动违反民主宪法的基本秩序时，将根据政府的起诉由宪法裁判所来加以判决，命令该政党解散”的条款。评论指出，这个所谓“宪法修正案”还规定二十岁以上公民才有选举权。南朝鲜反动统治集团这样作是企图把站在反对法西斯统治和争民主争自由斗争前列的广大青年排除在政治生活之外。
    评论说，作为美李集团法西斯恐怖统治的工具的南朝鲜傀儡“国会”，曾经批准和制造了一系列的卖国条约和法西斯法令，在国家和人民面前犯下了永不能洗刷的罪行，它们根本就没有资格谈什么“修改宪法”。
    评论强调说，只要美帝国主义侵略者还强占着南朝鲜，它的傀儡集团恐怖统治没有废除，不论是“总统责任制”还是“内阁责任制”，都不能改变其政权的卖国的反人民的本质。
    评论最后说，现在南朝鲜人民正高呼着“打倒腐败的政治”、“解散肮脏的国会”的口号，更高地燃起炽烈的斗争的火焰。人民的要求是不可阻挡的。南朝鲜人民决不能允许美帝国主义和它的傀儡们扶持和延长法西斯恐怖统治的阴谋诡计。他们为了彻底废除美李集团法西斯统治机构、立即解散傀儡“国会”，为了成立由工人、农民、青年学生等各界人民代表组成的临时行政机构，为了新政治、新制度、新生活的实现，正在更加勇敢地进行战斗。
