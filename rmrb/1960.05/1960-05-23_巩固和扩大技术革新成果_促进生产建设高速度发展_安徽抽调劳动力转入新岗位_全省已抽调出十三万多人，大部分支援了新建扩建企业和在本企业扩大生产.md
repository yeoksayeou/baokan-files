From our newspaper in Hefei, May 22nd: While vigorously carrying out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, the industrial and transportation front in Anhui Province has promptly adjusted labor organization. At present, more than 150,000 laborers have been saved, of which more than 130,000 have been transferred, which has greatly supported the province's newly built and expanded enterprises.

In the past few months, the broad masses of workers and staff in Anhui Province have launched a new upsurge of technical innovation and technical revolution. In many regions and units, transportation, crushing, loading and unloading, foundry, forging, carpentry, and bamboo weaving have basically achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization. Steel plants in Wuhu, Hefei, Bengbu, Huainan, and other places have mostly realized the mechanization and semi-mechanization of raw material crushing, screening, and in-plant transportation. Many small coal mines have changed from manual water pumping to electric, and most of the ore descending and coal exiting the well have been mechanized and semi-mechanized. With the rapid improvement of the level of mechanization and semi-mechanization, many workers have been liberated from manual operation and heavy physical labor. In Wuhu City alone, more than 27,000 workers have been freed from heavy physical labor in three months. In this way, many enterprises have the possibility of saving a large number of laborers. Bengbu City originally produced 1,000 tons of coke per day, requiring more than 7,000 workers. Now, after realizing mechanization and semi-mechanization, it merged the city's original sixteen coking units into one, uniformly used labor, and saved more than 5,800 people.

Enterprises in Anhui Province attach particular importance to promptly transferring the laborers saved. This not only greatly promoted the timely investment of technical innovation projects into production, but also consolidated and improved the technical innovation projects. For example, some steel plants in Wuhu City made ore crushers in technical innovation, and labor efficiency was greatly improved, and personnel could be saved. However, in the past, because the surplus labor was not transferred in time, when the crusher failed, it returned to manual crushing. Recently, the relevant leading departments have extracted more than 8,000 people from the crushing system, and the new technology of using crushers to crush ore has been consolidated. After a large number of workers were extracted, the workers actively thought of connecting ore crushing, screening, and transportation in order to improve the production efficiency of the crusher, which further promoted technical innovation.

Of the 150,000 laborers saved in the province, more than 64,000 laborers were saved due to technological innovation, and more than 80,000 laborers were saved due to the rectification of labor organization, adjustment of enterprise layout, and implementation of new staffing quotas. According to the principle of on-site adjustment, more than 130,000 of these saved laborers have been arranged to new jobs. Most of them supported newly built and expanded enterprises and expanded production in their own enterprises, and a small number entered technical schools or supported street and rural industries. For example, more than 20,000 laborers saved in Hefei City in three months, more than 10,000 supported the city's newly built and expanded enterprises, more than 8,000 were transferred within various enterprises, and the remaining 100 or so entered technical schools or went to rural areas and streets to help run industries.

When transferring the technical workers extracted to new jobs, all localities have tried their best to take care of their original technical expertise and achieved reasonable distribution. (Attached picture)

    巩固和扩大技术革新成果　促进生产建设高速度发展
    安徽抽调劳动力转入新岗位
    全省已抽调出十三万多人，大部分支援了新建扩建企业和在本企业扩大生产
    本报合肥22日电　安徽省工业交通战线在大闹技术革命的同时，及时调整劳动组织，目前已经节约了十五万多个劳动力，其中调出的有十三万多名，对支援全省新建和扩建企业等起了很大作用。
    安徽省广大职工最近几个月掀起了技术革新和技术革命运动的新高潮，很多地区和单位的运输、破碎、装卸、铸工、锻工、木工、篾工等工种已基本实现了机械化、半机械化。芜湖、合肥、蚌埠、淮南等地的钢铁厂大都实现了原料破碎、筛分和厂内运输的机械化、半机械化。许多小煤窑的人工抽水改为电动，矿石下山、煤炭出井大多数实现了机械化和半机械化。随着机械化、半机械化水平的迅速提高，许多工人从手工操作和笨重体力劳动中解放出来。仅芜湖市在三个月的时间内就有两万七千多工人摆脱了笨重体力劳动。这样，许多企业就有可能节省出大批劳动力。蚌埠市原来日产焦一千吨，需要七千多工人，现在实现了机械化、半机械化，就把全市原有的十六个炼焦单位合并成一个，统一使用劳动力，节省了五千八百多人。
    安徽省各企业特别重视把节省下来的劳动力及时抽调出来。这样，不仅大大促进了技术革新项目的及时投入生产，而且还使技术革新项目得到了巩固和提高。如芜湖市有些钢铁厂在技术革新中制成了矿石破碎机后，劳动效率大大提高了，人员可以节省。但是，过去由于没有及时把多余的劳动力抽调出来，因此，当破碎机发生故障时，就又回到了手工破碎。最近，有关领导部门在破碎系统抽出了八千多人，使用破碎机破碎矿石的新技术就巩固下来了。大量工人抽出以后，工人们为了提高破碎机的生产效率，又积极想法把矿石破碎、筛分、运输连接起来，进一步推动了技术革新。
    在全省节省的十五万名劳动力中，由于革新技术节省出来的劳动力有六万四千多人，因整顿劳动组织、调整企业布局、实行新的定员定额节省的劳动力有八万多人。这批节省出来的劳动力，根据就地调整的原则，已安排了十三万多名到了新的工作岗位。其中大部分支援了新建扩建企业和本企业扩大生产，少数人进了技术学校或支援街道、农村办工业。如合肥市三个月内节省的二万多名劳动力，有一万多名支援了本市新建扩建企业，八千多名在各企业内部进行了调剂，其余的一百多名进技工学校或到农村、街道帮助办工业。
    各地对抽调出来的技术工人调往新的工作岗位时，都尽量照顾了他们原来的技术特长，做到了合理分配。（附图片）
