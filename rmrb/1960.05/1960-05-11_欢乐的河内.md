　　Joyful Hanoi
　　Xinhua News Agency reporters Yu Minsheng, Hu Benying

　　This is an unforgettable moment: Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi, accompanied by Premier Pham Van Dong, arrived at the Presidential Palace this morning in an open-top car. President Ho Chi Minh greeted them with a smile, warmly embracing Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi upon meeting them. Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi excitedly said, "We have come specifically to wish President Ho Chi Minh a happy 70th birthday!" President Ho smiled and said, "A warm welcome to you!" At this moment, thunderous applause erupted from the surrounding crowd.

　　At this unforgettable moment, one cannot help but think of the two young and ancient nations of China and Vietnam, which have not only sympathized with and supported each other during those difficult years but are also helping each other, learning from each other, and advancing hand in hand in today's socialist construction. The lofty ideal of communism and the noble principle of internationalism closely link the people of China and Vietnam. The friendship between the people of China and Vietnam is eternal and unbreakable. This friendship is fully embodied in the enthusiastic welcome of the people of Hanoi to Premier Zhou today.

　　The people of Hanoi have just successfully conducted the National Assembly elections and are now welcoming Premier Zhou Enlai's friendly visit. They connect these two events and call it "double happiness." Many citizens hung red lanterns in front of their doors, with eye-catching golden "happiness" characters pasted on them. From the Presidential Palace to Gia Lam Airport, arches were erected all along the way, and the national flags of China and Vietnam fluttered all over the city. Countless banners hanging in the air expressed the deep friendship of the Vietnamese people towards the Chinese people: "Welcome Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Vietnam!" "The friendship between the people of Vietnam and China will last forever!"

　　When Premier Zhou and Vice Premier Chen, accompanied by Premier Pham Van Dong, traveled from the airport to the Presidential Palace in an open-top car, over 100,000 people enthusiastically cheered along the ten-kilometer route. Waving Chinese and Vietnamese national flags, eye-catching red banners, bright and dazzling bouquets, and beautiful and colorful costumes formed a colorful river of friendship, like a rainbow falling to the ground, magnificent and moving. The open-top car carrying Premier Zhou seemed to sail along this colorful river of friendship. Wherever Premier Zhou arrived, there was jubilation, continuous applause, and friendly cheers rising into the clouds.

　　The workers, peasants, students, and people of all ethnic groups and walks of life in Hanoi expressed their friendship towards the Chinese people with indescribable passion. Many gorgeously dressed young women stood in the middle of the road with flower baskets, scattering flower petals on Premier Zhou and presenting bouquets of flowers to Premier Zhou. Many people jumped and played various national musical instruments, and many people performed various national dances along the road, including dragon dances and lion dances. Young people from the Lati and Bana ethnic groups performed their most beautiful national dances to welcome the distinguished Chinese guests. Among the welcoming crowd, there were not only young people and women, but also white-haired old ladies and gentlemen, and innocent and lively children. A group of workers building a large building also stopped working when they saw Premier Zhou's arrival, gathered on top of the building, and waved huge Chinese and Vietnamese flags to cheer the distinguished Chinese guests.

　　Premier Zhou's car, full of the friendship of the people of Hanoi, arrived at the Presidential Palace. President Ho Chi Minh stood on the steps at the gate, warmly welcoming Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Chen Yi, Vice Minister Zhang Hanfu, and other Chinese comrades. At this time, tens of thousands of people enthusiastically applauded and cheered in front of the Presidential Palace. President Ho Chi Minh, Premier Zhou Enlai, Premier Pham Van Dong, and Vice Premier Chen Yi, among others, stood on high and waved frequently to the crowd in return. At this time, the applause became even more enthusiastic, the cheers were even louder, and the joyous mood of the crowd reached a climax.

　　This is the deep friendship of the Vietnamese people towards the Chinese people. This friendship is endless. Vietnamese comrades told us that the Vietnamese people's anticipation for the arrival of Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi can truly be described as "straining their eyes." When the news of the Chinese Premier and Vice Premier's visit to Vietnam was announced, people looked forward to this day day and night. This news added infinite joy to Vietnam's national holiday - the second National Assembly election. After the election ended on May 8, the people of Hanoi decorated and hung colorful flags and slogans to welcome Premier Zhou overnight. Many people voluntarily came out to sweep the streets. In recent days, many prominent figures, workers, students, and cadres, unable to restrain their excitement, have written articles in newspapers to express their warmest welcome and respect to Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi. All newspapers used large headlines to hail "the eternal friendship between China and Vietnam." Mr. Bui Ky, President of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association and a well-known sinologist, who is currently ill in bed, wrote enthusiastic verses in Chinese, fully expressing the sentiments of the Vietnamese people. He wrote:

　　The five-star red flag flies in space, the peace envoy rides the east wind,
　　Having passed through Burma, India, and Indonesia, peaceful solutions have been achieved.
　　The peace envoy visits my Vietnam, the whole nation welcomes with joy,
　　Thank you for your selfless assistance, my Vietnam is currently under construction.
　　The friendship between Vietnam and China is like the sea and sky, high and profound, forever lasting,
　　I wish to offer a glass of friendship, reminiscing about the festivities four years ago.

　　What is most touching is the deep affection of Hanoi's workers for Premier Zhou Enlai and the Chinese people. When Premier Zhou Enlai first visited Vietnam in 1956, he visited the Hanoi Unified Match Factory. The workers there still remember Premier Zhou Enlai to this day. Recently, when they heard the news that Premier Zhou would visit Vietnam again, they launched a short-term competition movement, determined to strive for greater achievements in production to welcome Premier Zhou Enlai, and wrote a letter to the Chinese Embassy telling them of their determination, asking the Embassy to convey it to Premier Zhou. The staff and workers of the Hanoi Cigarette Factory, Rubber Factory, and Soap Factory, in order to welcome Premier Zhou, in addition to ensuring that they worked hard to carry out the competition, also used their spare time to level the courtyard, repair flower beds, and carry out a major cleaning, making the factory look brand new. These moving examples are simply too numerous to list.

　　The deep friendship of the Vietnamese people made Chinese comrades feel like they had come to their own home in Vietnam. After arriving in Hanoi, Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi went to visit President Ho Chi Minh and Premier Pham Van Dong. It was truly a cordial meeting. President Ho Chi Minh was so amiable and kind, he said to the Chinese comrades in an extremely caring tone: "You have traveled to several countries, you have worked hard, you must rest well, coming here is like returning to your own home, and when I go to China, it is like returning to my own home, everyone should not be polite!" Premier Zhou also said: "Yes, we have returned to our own home!" The scene of this meeting reflects that the friendship between China and Vietnam is so close and intimate, it is eternal and unbreakable!

    欢乐的河内
    新华社记者　于民生　胡本英
    这是一个难忘的时刻：周恩来总理、陈毅副总理今天上午由范文同总理陪同乘敞篷汽车来到了主席府。胡志明主席含笑迎上前来，他同周恩来总理、陈毅副总理一见面就热情地紧紧拥抱在一起。周恩来总理和陈毅副总理兴奋地说：“我们是特地赶来向胡主席祝贺七十大寿的！”胡主席笑着说：“热烈欢迎你们！”这时候在周围的人群响起了春雷般的掌声。
    在这难忘的时刻，人们不禁想起了中越这两个年青而古老的民族，它们不仅在过去那些患难的岁月里，就互相同情、互相支持，而且在社会主义建设的今天，它们又相互帮助、相互学习、携手并肩前进。共产主义的远大理想和国际主义的崇高原则把中越两国人民紧密地联系在一起。中越两国人民的友谊是永恒的和牢不可破的。这种友谊充分地体现在河内市民今天对周总理的热情欢迎中。
    河内市民刚刚胜利地进行了国会选举，现在又在迎接周恩来总理的友好访问，他们把这两件事情联系在一起，叫作“双喜临门”。许多市民的门前挂起了红色大灯笼，上面贴着醒目的金色“喜”字。从主席府到嘉林机场，一路上搭起了一个又一个的彩牌楼，中越两国国旗满城飘扬。悬挂在道路上空的无数横幅标语表达了越南人民对中国人民的深厚友情：“欢迎周恩来总理访问越南！”“越中两国人民友谊万古长青！”
    当周总理、陈副总理由范文同总理陪同乘敞篷汽车从机场前往主席府的时候，在长达十公里的道路两旁有上十万人热情沸腾地夹道欢呼。挥舞着的中越两国国旗，醒目的红色大标语，鲜艳夺目的花束，还有美丽鲜艳的服装，组成了一条彩色缤纷的友谊河流，有如彩虹落地，壮丽动人。周总理乘坐的敞篷汽车有如沿着这条彩色缤纷的友谊河流航行，周总理到了那里，那里就欢腾起来，掌声连绵不断，友谊的欢呼声直上云霄。
    河内的工人、农民、学生和各族、各界人民以难以描述的激情表达着他们对中国人民的友谊。许多盛装的女青年手提花篮站在路中央，她们把鲜花瓣撒在周总理身上，把一束又一束的鲜花献给周总理。多少人在跳跃着吹奏着各种民族乐器，多少人在道路两旁表演着各种民族舞蹈，这里有龙舞，也有狮子舞。拉迪族和巴拿族的青年表演着他们最优美的民族舞蹈欢迎中国贵宾。在夹道欢迎的人群中，不仅有青年、妇女，还有白发苍苍的老大娘、老大爷和天真活泼的儿童。一群正在建筑大楼的工人们，看到周总理到来时，也停下工作，聚集在建筑物顶上，高举两国巨大的中国和越南的国旗向中国贵宾欢呼。
    周总理的汽车满载着河内市民的友情到达了主席府。胡志明主席站在大门口的台阶上，热情地欢迎周恩来总理、陈毅副总理、章汉夫副部长和其他中国同志。这时候，成千上万的群众在主席府门前热情迸发地鼓掌欢呼。胡志明主席、周恩来总理、范文同总理和陈毅副总理等，站在高处，向群众频频挥手答礼。这时候，掌声更加热烈，欢呼声也更高，群众的欢乐情绪达到了高潮。
    这就是越南人民对中国人民的深厚友情。这种友情是写不完道不尽的。越南同志告诉我们，越南人民盼望周恩来总理和陈毅副总理到来的心情，真可以说是“望眼欲穿”。中国总理和副总理将要访问越南的消息公布的时候，人们就日日夜夜地期待着这一天的到来。这个消息，更使越南举国欢腾的全民节日——第二届国会选举，平添了无限欢乐的气氛。5月8日选举结束以后，河内人民连夜布置、张挂欢迎周总理的彩旗、标语。许多人自动出来打扫街道。这些天来，许多著名人士、工人、学生、干部，抑制不住兴奋的心情，纷纷在报纸上著文向周恩来总理和陈毅副总理表示最热烈的欢迎和敬意，所有的报纸都用大字标题欢呼“中越友谊万古长青”。正在卧病中的越中友好协会会长、著名汉学家裴杞老先生用中文写的热情洋溢的诗句，充分表达了越南人民的心意。他写道：
    五星红旗飞太空，和平使者乘东风，
    曾过缅、印、尼三国，和平解决皆收功。
    和平使者访我越，全民欢迎和喜悦，
    感谢无私援助情，我越正在当建设。
    越中友谊如海天，高深永远寿绵绵，
    愿上友好一杯酒，回忆联欢四年前。
    最使人感动的是河内的工人对周恩来总理和中国人民的深厚感情。1956年周恩来总理第一次访问越南时曾经参观过河内统一火柴厂，那里的工人至今仍怀念着周恩来总理。最近，当他们听到周总理将再次访问越南的消息以后，他们就开展了一个短期的竞赛运动，决心在生产中争取更大的成绩来欢迎周恩来总理，并且把他们的决心写信告诉中国大使馆，请大使馆转达周总理。河内卷烟厂、橡胶厂、肥皂厂的职工为了欢迎周总理，除了保证努力开展竞赛外，还利用业余时间平整庭院，修整花圃，进行大扫除，把工厂打扮得焕然一新。这些动人的事例简直难以一一列举。
    越南人民的深厚友情使中国同志感到来到越南就像来到了自己的家里。周恩来总理、陈毅副总理在到达河内以后，就去拜会了胡志明主席和范文同总理。这真是一次亲切的会见。胡志明主席是那样的和蔼可亲，他用极为关怀的口吻对中国同志说：“你们跑了好几个国家，你们辛苦了，要好好休息一下，到了这里就是回到了自己的家里，我到了中国也像回到了自己家里一样，大家都不要客气！”周总理也说：“是的，我们回到了自己的家里！”这次会见的情景反映出，中越两国的友谊，是这样的亲密无间，它是永恒的，牢不可破的！
