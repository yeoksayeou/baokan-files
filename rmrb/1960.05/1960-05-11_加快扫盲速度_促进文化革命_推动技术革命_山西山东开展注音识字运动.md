Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 10th: Since January this year, a mass movement to learn from Wanrong and catch up with Wanrong in using Hanyu Pinyin for literacy has been vigorously carried out in Shanxi Province, forming a huge momentum of everyone teaching and everyone learning. According to incomplete statistics in early April, the number of people learning Pinyin letters in the province, including students in full-time and part-time schools and children in kindergartens, has reached more than 6.4 million, accounting for almost 40% of the province's total population. The movement is characterized by short time, fast speed, and great achievements. It took only seven days for Taiyuan City from mobilization to full-scale implementation, and now more than 500,000 people in the city have participated in the learning. The number of learners in the Jinan Special District has increased to 2.05 million, exceeding 80% of the total number of young and middle-aged people in the district. In mid-March, the number of learners in the Jinbei Special District was only 30,000, but by early April it had surged to more than 1.39 million, an increase of 45 times.

After the workers and peasants learned the Hanyu Pinyin letters, they used it as a literacy tool, greatly accelerating the progress of literacy. According to statistics from 21 cities and counties including Taiyuan and Tunliu, 261,145 illiterate people, after learning Pinyin letters and receiving 130 to 160 hours of extensive reading and writing teaching, can recognize more than 1,500 Chinese characters, and can read and write, reaching the standard of eliminating illiteracy. Not only is the speed of literacy greatly accelerated, but the quality is also significantly improved. According to the results of the acceptance inspection of 37,700 literacy graduates in Hongtong County, those who fully meet the graduation standards in the three subjects of literacy, reading, and writing accounted for 89.1%, and those who passed the literacy and reading subjects accounted for 4.8%. Compared with the past, the pass rate of literacy graduates increased by 29.1%. Many students wrote poems praising Pinyin letters after becoming literate. Ren Yulan, a mother of five children, compiled a jingle: "Learn the Pinyin scheme skillfully, it's really convenient to read and study. No more worrying about less time, no more worrying about no one to teach. I've learned a lot of words, and I'll get rid of the illiteracy label forever."

After the vast number of workers and peasants mastered the Hanyu Pinyin scheme, almost everyone read books. Many people read more than a dozen or dozens of books, and many literacy graduates read one or two hundred books, and tens of thousands of literacy graduates are reading the Pinyin edition of Chairman Mao's works.

After many amateur primary schools in cities and counties of Shanxi Province adopted the method of phonetic literacy, it promoted the teaching reform of the Chinese language curriculum, and opened up a path for shortening the teaching years, improving the quality of teaching, and accelerating the knowledge of workers and peasants. The amateur Red and Expert School primary school class in Sun Gu Management District, Wanrong County, used 150 class hours to teach the first, second, and third volumes of Chinese language, which used to take three years. The Red and Expert School primary school classes in Dongfeng Commune, Xinding County, Huoshaowa in Zuoyun, and Songchang Village in Yuncheng, all shortened the time by one-half or two-thirds compared with the original. Completed the primary school Chinese language teaching task.

The rapid development of the Pinyin literacy movement in Shanxi Province is due to the new situation of continuous leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, especially with the advent of the upsurge of technological revolution and cultural revolution, the vast number of people are eager to rapidly improve their political, cultural, and technical level. Therefore, the achievement of the Pinyin literacy movement is a victory for the Party's cultural revolution and language reform policy.

The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Committee attached great importance to the leadership of the Pinyin literacy movement, and timely summarized and promoted the Wanrong County's Pinyin literacy experience. Shanxi Daily has successively published editorials, special pages, and opened a Pinyin literacy column. The Jinan Special Office and Wanrong County have both created Pinyin tabloids. On April 20, the Shanxi Provincial People's Committee issued a "Notice on Using Pinyin Letters to Arrange Literacy Environment," deciding that all organs, schools, groups, and enterprises in the province should annotate all Chinese characters used in the environment with Pinyin letters, creating a greater momentum for carrying out the Pinyin literacy movement in the province.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 10th: Shandong Province has made great achievements in the Hanyu Pinyin literacy movement. The Shandong Provincial Department of Education held a provincial on-site conference on Pinyin literacy in Pingyuan County in mid-March. After the meeting, various places, under the slogan of learning from Wanrong, catching up with Wanrong, learning from Pingyuan, and catching up with Pingyuan, held Pinyin literacy leap forward mobilization rallies, and an upsurge of the Pinyin literacy movement is taking shape. According to statistics as of April 20, the number of students learning Pinyin letters in literacy classes and spare-time schools across the province reached 4.55 million.

Pingyuan County originally had more than 190,000 illiterate young and middle-aged people. After liberation, 33,000 illiterate people were eliminated in eight years. In 1958, the year of the Great Leap Forward, 38,000 illiterate people were eliminated, exceeding the total of the past eight years. In 1959, due to the implementation of Pinyin literacy, 95,000 illiterate people were eliminated in one year, which was two and a half times that of 1958. At present, it has basically become a county without illiteracy among young and middle-aged people. On the basis of eliminating illiteracy, this county has rapidly popularized amateur primary education and developed amateur secondary education through Pinyin literacy. At present, the number of students in amateur primary schools has reached more than 130,000, and the number of students in amateur secondary schools has also reached more than 18,000.

In the past year, this county has also cultivated more than 12,000 agricultural technical talents and more than 2,900 grass-roots cadres through Pinyin literacy. Students participating in spare-time school learning have created and reformed 25,000 pieces of agricultural tools, effectively promoting technological reform and promoting production. For example, Wang Xuezheng, a student from Dongwangzhuang Commune who became literate not long ago, successfully trial-produced 39 kinds of local pesticides for killing insects using castor leaves and cypress leaves after reading scientific and technical knowledge about killing insects in the Pinyin newspaper; Li Gu Temple Agricultural Comprehensive Technology School used Pinyin letters to annotate difficult characters in the technical textbooks, helping students to learn and improving the technical level of students in planting cotton, creating a bumper harvest record of 1,150 jin per mu.

Qingdao City has also made remarkable achievements in promoting Pinyin literacy. The number of workers and peasants participating in learning has reached more than 477,000. A literacy class of 32 people in the South District Vegetable and Fruit Company, on the basis of fully mobilizing thoughts, combined the experience of Wanrong Pinyin literacy and Qiqihar rapid literacy, and became completely literate in only 48 hours of classroom teaching (extra-curricular review time outside). At the end of March, when the city conducted a literacy graduation examination, all students in the class passed. After becoming literate, they read the Pinyin version of Chairman Mao's works and improved their political awareness. In the technical innovation movement, they have written more than 30 articles of experience and understanding, put forward 24 rationalization proposals, and completed 8 innovation projects.

    加快扫盲速度　促进文化革命　推动技术革命
    山西山东开展注音识字运动
    据新华社太原10电　一个群众性的学万荣、赶万荣的汉语注音识字运动，今年1月以来，在山西蓬勃开展。形成了万人教、全民学的巨大声势。据4月上旬的不完全统计，全省学习拼音字母的群众，包括全日制、半日制学校的学生和幼儿园的幼儿在内，已达六百四十多万人，几乎占到全省总人口的40％。运动的特点是：时间短，速度快，成绩大。太原市从发动到全面开展，只用了七天时间，现在全市已有五十余万人参加学习。晋南专区学习人数已增加到二百零五万人，超过全区青壮年总人数80％。晋北专区3月中旬学习人数仅三万人，至4月上旬猛增到一百三十九万多人，增加了四十五倍。
    工农群众学会了汉语拼音字母后，利用它作为识字工具，大大加快了扫盲进度。据太原、屯长等二十一个市、县统计，已有二十六万一千一百四十五名文盲，学会拼音字母后经过一百三十到一百六十个小时的大量阅读和写作教学，就能识到一千五百多个汉字，能读、能写，达到脱盲标准。不仅扫盲速度大大加快，而且质量有显著提高。根据洪洞县对三万七千七百名扫盲毕业学员的验收结果，识字、阅读、写作三门完全合乎毕业标准的占89.1％，识字、阅读两门及格的占4.8％，和过去相比，扫盲毕业学员的合格率提高了29.1％。许多学员脱盲后写诗歌颂拼音字母。五个孩子的妈妈任玉兰编了一段顺口溜：“拼音方案学熟练，识字读书真方便。再不发愁时间少，再不发愁没人教。学的字儿真不少，永远摘掉文盲帽。”
    广大工农群众掌握了汉语拼音方案后，几乎是人人读书，许多人读了十几本，几十本，有不少学员读了一、二百本，并有成千上万的脱盲学员在阅读注音的毛主席著作。
    山西省各市、县的许多业余高小，采用注音识字的办法以后，促进了语文课程的教学改革，为缩短教学年限，提高教学质量，加快工农群众的知识化开辟了道路。万荣县孙谷管理区的业余红专学校高小班，用一百五十个课时教完了过去用三年时间教完的一、二、三册语文。忻定县东风公社、左云火烧洼和运城松常村等地的红专学校高小班，都比原来缩短二分之一或三分之二的时间。完成了高小语文教学任务。
    山西省注音识字运动的迅速开展，是由于在工农业生产持续跃进的新形势下，特别是随着技术革命与文化革命高潮的到来，广大群众迫切要求迅速提高政治、文化、技术水平。因此，注音识字运动成绩的取得，是党的文化革命和文字改革方针的胜利。
    中共山西省委和省人民委员会十分重视注音识字运动的领导，及时总结和推广了万荣县的注音扫盲经验。山西日报为此连续发表社论、出版专页，并开辟了注音识字专栏。晋南专署和万荣县都创办了拼音小报。山西省人民委员会于4月20日发出了“关于利用拼音字母布置识字环境”的通知，决定全省所有机关、学校、团体和企业部门作到环境用的汉字，一律注上拼音字母，为开展注音识字运动在全省造成更大的声势。
    据新华社济南10日电　山东省汉语注音识字运动，取得了很大的成绩。山东省教育厅于3月中旬曾在平原县召开了全省注音识字现场会议，会后，各地在学万荣、赶万荣，学平原、赶平原的口号下，纷纷召开注音识字跃进誓师大会，一个注音识字运动的高潮正在形成。截至4月20日的统计，全省扫盲班和业余学校学员学习拼音字母的达到了四百五十五万人。
    平原县原有青壮年文盲十九万多人。解放以后，八年扫除文盲三万三千多人。大跃进的1958年，扫除了文盲三万八千人，超过过去八年的总和。而1959年，由于推行了注音识字，一年就扫除文盲九万五千人，为1958年的两倍半。目前已基本上成为青壮年无盲县。这个县在扫盲的基础上，通过注音识字又迅速普及了业余初等教育，发展了业余中等教育。现在业余初等学校在校学员已达十三万多人，业余中等学校学员也已有一万八千多人。
    这个县一年来还通过注音识字培养了农业技术人材一万二千多人，培养了基层干部两千九百多人。参加业余学校学习的学员创制和改制了农具两万五千件，有效地促进了技术改革，推动了生产。如董王庄公社脱盲不久的学员王学正，从拼音报上看到有关杀虫的科学技术知识后，用蓖麻子叶和柏树叶试制成功三十九种杀虫的土农药；李古寺农业综合技术学校利用拼音字母给技术课本的难字注音，帮助学习，提高了学员种植棉花的技术水平，创造了亩产一千一百五十斤的丰产纪录。
    青岛市推广注音识字，也取得了显著成绩，参加学习的工农群众已达四十七万七千余人。市南区蔬菜果品公司一个扫盲班三十二人，在充分做好思想发动的基础上，结合了万荣注音扫盲和齐齐哈尔快速扫盲的经验，仅用四十八小时的课堂教学（课外复习时间在外），即全部脱盲。3月底全市进行扫盲毕业考试时，全班学员全部及格。他们在脱盲以后阅读毛主席著作的注音本，提高了自己的政治觉悟。在技术革新运动中，他们已写出三十多篇心得和体会，提出二十四项合理化建议，并完成了八项革新项目。
