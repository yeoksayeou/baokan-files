One Side is Despicable and Shameless, the Other Side is Heroic Struggle

	Summon Police, Drive Away All Opposition Party Members
	Stage a Farce, Unilaterally Announce New Treaty "Passed"
	Demonstrations and Protests From Night Until Dawn
	30,000 People Angrily Surround the Japanese Diet
Under the support of U.S. imperialism, the Japanese Nobusuke Kishi traitorous clique used fascist violence and various despicable means to illegally force the House of Representatives to "pass" the aggressive Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, creating an unprecedented scandal in the history of the Japanese Diet.

	Conspiring to Illegally Pass the Treasonous Treaty
	Deliberately Proposing to Extend the Diet Session
On the 19th, the Nobusuke Kishi government first submitted a proposal to both the House of Councillors and the House of Representatives to extend the Diet session to the 26th. The purpose was to use the "principle of the superiority of the House of Representatives" stipulated in the constitution to complete the procedure of Diet approval of the treaty even if the House of Councillors could not pass it. This is because the Japanese constitution stipulates that if the House of Councillors cannot make a decision within thirty days after the House of Representatives passes a treaty, the decision of the House of Representatives can be regarded as the decision of the Diet. Nobusuke Kishi put forward this proposal entirely to please U.S. imperialism, so as to "present a gift" to U.S. President Eisenhower when he visits Japan on June 19.

In the afternoon, the Liberal Democratic Party first convened the House of Representatives Steering Committee and forcibly passed the proposal before the opposition party members arrived at the venue. The House of Representatives "Security Treaty" Special Committee also held a meeting. The chairman of this committee from the Liberal Democratic Party, Ozawa, ignoring the protests of the Socialist Party and Communist Party members, unilaterally announced the end of the discussion on the new "Security Treaty." He also announced that a plenary session of the House of Representatives would be held at 5:00 p.m. to vote on the new "Security Treaty." At this time, the committee meeting immediately fell into chaos.

	Socialist Party Tries to Prevent the Meeting
	The Ruling Party Actually Commits Violence
The Socialist Party members immediately rushed to the front of the office of the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Ichiro Kiyose, and built a fence with desks and chairs, sitting on them to prevent Kiyose from forcibly convening a plenary session of the House of Representatives. Ruling party members beat up Socialist Party members and introduced 700 fascist thugs who had been prepared in advance into the Diet to commit violence. The melee lasted for half an hour. Several members were injured. The Liberal Democratic Party tried several times to forcibly convene a plenary session of the House of Representatives, but was blocked by Socialist Party members.

Taking advantage of this chaotic situation, the chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party, Ozawa, announced the resumption of the "Security Treaty" Special Committee. In the chaotic situation, the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" was "passed" without allowing the opposition party to conduct any questioning.

Liberal Democratic Party members took advantage of the opposition party members' attention being focused on the "Security Treaty" Special Committee and rushed into the plenary session hall of the House of Representatives.

	Summoning Five Hundred Police Officers in the Middle of the Night
	Using Force to Carry Away Opposition Party Members
At 11:50 p.m., the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Ichiro Kiyose, summoned 500 police officers into the Diet through a loudspeaker. The police beat up opposition party members and used the barbaric method of three to six police officers carrying one member, dragging away members of the Socialist Party and the Communist Party.

While resisting the police's coercion, opposition party members shouted: "U.S. agents go home," "Nobusuke Kishi, you are the Syngman Rhee of Japan." They sang the "National Independence Action Team" song while resisting the police's violent actions.

After the police carried away the opposition party members, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Ichiro Kiyose, entered the meeting hall. In the absence of any opposition party members, Ichiro Kiyose announced the convening of a House of Representatives "plenary session." He conducted a "vote" on the issue of extending the Diet session by fifty days and immediately announced that "the resolution has passed."

At 12:05 a.m., Kiyose announced another "plenary session." The chairman of the "Security Treaty" Special Committee, Ozawa, hurriedly made a brief "report" at the meeting on the discussions of the special committee on the new "Security Treaty" and its supplementary agreements. Subsequently, the House of Representatives voted without any discussion and announced that the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty opposed by the vast majority of the Japanese people had been "passed." The entire process only took fourteen minutes.

When Kiyose announced the House of Representatives "ratification" of the treaty, 500 police officers in formation guarded the entrance of the meeting hall.

The dirty new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" was "passed" not only in the absence of all opposition party members but also in the absence of more than thirty ruling party members.

	Mourning the Fate of the Nation, the Masses Angrily Demonstrate
	Surrounding the Diet to Oppose Nobusuke Kishi
Nobusuke Kishi's despicable actions angered the Japanese people.

More than 30,000 angry people in Tokyo surrounded the Japanese Diet on the night of May 19 to oppose the Nobusuke Kishi traitorous clique's conspiracy to forcibly pass the extension of the Diet session and the aggressive Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. People from all walks of life in Japan, concerned about the fate of their country, braved the pouring rain to hold large-scale protests and demonstrations. They issued earth-shattering roars: "Oppose the ratification of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty!" "Dissolve the Diet immediately!" "Nobusuke Kishi get out!" "Down with the Nobusuke Kishi government!" "The people of South Korea overthrew Syngman Rhee, we want to overthrow Nobusuke Kishi!"

Since the "National Conference to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty" issued an emergency call on the evening of the 19th, people poured in from all directions to the Diet with extremely high spirits. The number of demonstrators increased rapidly, exceeding the National Conference's plan to mobilize 10,000 people, and quickly reached more than 30,000 in a few hours.

Members of the Japanese Socialist Party and the Japanese Communist Party, who were engaged in an unyielding struggle in the Diet building to prevent the opening of the plenary session of the House of Representatives, delivered speeches from the windows of the Diet building, encouraging the demonstrators to fight. At this time, red flags were waving, and the demonstrators shouted slogans.

At this time, the Nobusuke Kishi government dispatched 5,000 armed police and dozens of armored vehicles and trucks to deploy on the roads surrounding the Diet's walls. The police's loudspeakers screamed loudly, threatening to use force to deal with the demonstrators and demanding that they disperse. But the songs of workers and students drowned out the police's roars.

At 9:30 p.m., 30,000 demonstrators held a protest rally on the road behind the Diet's walls. The wide road was crowded with workers and students holding flags.

	An Elderly Poet With Lofty Aspirations Speaks Out
	The People's Struggle is Bound to be Victorious
Socialist Party Diet members Hideo Yamahana and Isamu Akamatsu, Communist Party House of Representatives member Yoshio Shiga, and "Security Treaty Critique Association" representative and poet Sumako Fukao spoke at the meeting. In their speeches, they all emphasized that the power of the people outside the Diet must now strongly support the opposition party members' struggle in the Diet.

Yoshio Shiga said that the Socialist Party and the Communist Party were closely united in the Diet struggle, and he called on the demonstrators to carry the struggle through to the end. The 65-year-old poet Sumako Fukao said loudly: "Using the power of the people gathered there tonight, we can overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi government. The Japanese people have a bright future."

During their speeches, the spirited demonstrators shouted: "We are ready!" "Let us fight all night!" Angry crowds demonstrated around the Diet and then held a parade in the streets. They fought all night until more than 3:00 a.m. on the 20th, when the demonstrators returned to their workplaces to prepare for a larger-scale struggle against the ratification of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty that day.

    一面是卑鄙无耻，一面是英勇斗争
    召警察　赶走全部在野党议员
    演丑剧　片面宣布新条约“通过”
    示威抗议从黑夜直到黎明
    三万群众愤怒包围日本国会
    在美帝国主义的支持下，日本岸信介卖国集团施用法西斯暴力和各种卑鄙手段，非法地强使众议院“通过”侵略性日美军事同盟条约，制造了日本国会史上空前未有的大丑剧。
    阴谋非法通过卖国条约
    故意提议延长国会会期
    19日上午，岸信介政府首先向参、众两院提出了一项延长国会会期到26日结束的提案。其目的是要利用宪法规定的“众议院优越原则”在参议院不能通过的情况下也完成国会批准这个条约的手续，因为日本宪法规定在众议院通过条约的三十天内，参议院不能作出决议，也可以众议院的决议算作国会的决议。岸信介所以提出这个提案完全是为了取悦美帝国主义，以便在美国总统艾森豪威尔6月19日访问日本时向他“献礼”。
    下午，自由民主党先召开众议院议程委员会，在反对党议员还没有到达会场的时候强行通过了这个提案。众议院“安全条约”特别委员会也召开会议。这个委员会的自由民主党的委员长小泽不顾社会党议员和共产党议员的抗议，片面宣布结束对新“安全条约”的讨论。他并且宣布要在下午五时召开众议院全体会议，就新“安全条约”进行表决。这时，委员会会议立即陷入混乱。
      社会党力阻开会
      执政党竟然行凶
    社会党的议员们立即涌到众议院议长清濑一郎的办公室前面，用办公桌和椅子筑成栅栏，并坐在上面，阻止清濑强行召集众议院全体会议。执政党议员动手殴打社会党议员，并把事先预备好的七百名法西斯暴徒引进国会行凶。双方混战持续了半个小时。有数名议员被打伤。自由民主党几次企图强行召开众议院全体会议，都被社会党议员阻止了。
    利用这种混乱情况，自由民主党的委员长小泽又宣布“安全条约”特别委员会复会，在混乱局面中，不容反对党进行任何质询就“通过”了新日美“安全条约”。
    自由民主党议员利用在野党议员注意力集中在“安全条约”特别委员会的机会，冲入众议院全体会议的大会议厅。
    深夜里召来五百名警察
    动武力架走反对党议员
    晚上十一时五十分，众议院议长清濑一郎通过扩音器把五百名警察叫进国会。警察殴打在野党议员，并用三个到六个警察架一个议员的野蛮手段，把社会党和共产党国会议员拖走。
    反对党议员一边抵抗警察的胁持，一边高呼：“美国代理人滚回家去”、“岸信介，你是日本的李承晚”。他们在抵抗警察的暴力行动时高唱“民族独立行动队”之歌。
    警察把反对党议员架走后，众议院议长清濑一郎进入会议厅。在一个在野党议员也没有的情况下，清濑一郎宣布召开众议院“全体会议”。他就关于延长国会会期五十天问题进行“表决”，并立即宣布，“决议通过了”。
    午夜十二时零五分，清濑又宣布再次举行“全体会议”。“安全条约”特别委员会委员长小泽在会上匆匆忙忙地就特别委员会关于新“安全条约”和附属协定的讨论情况作了简短的“报告”。随后，众议院未经任何讨论就进行表决，并且宣布“通过”了遭到广大日本人民反对的日美军事同盟条约。先后只经过十四分钟。
    当清濑宣布众议院“批准”这个条约的时候，排成方阵的五百名警察就在会议厅的入口处防哨。
    肮脏的新日美“安全条约”不仅是在在野党全体议员而且也是在三十多位执政党议员缺席的情况下“通过”的。
    悲国运群众怒示威
    围国会反对岸信介
    岸信介的卑鄙行径激怒了日本人民。
    东京三万多愤怒的人群5月19日夜包围日本国会，反对岸信介卖国集团强使众议院通过延长国会会期和侵略性日美军事同盟条约的阴谋。关心自己国家命运的日本各界人民，冒着倾盆大雨，举行大规模的抗议示威。他们发出震撼山河的吼声：“反对批准日美安全条约！”“立即解散国会！”“岸信介滚蛋！”“打倒岸信介政府！”“南朝鲜人民打倒了李承晚，我们要打倒岸信介！”。
    自从日本“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”在19日傍晚发出紧急号召后，人们怀着十分激昂的心情从四面八方涌向国会。示威群众越来越多，超过了国民会议预定动员一万人的计划，在几小时以内就迅速达到三万多人。
    在国会大厦中从事不屈不挠的斗争以阻止众议院全体会议开幕的日本社会党和日本共产党议员们，从国会大厦的窗口发表了演说，鼓励示威者进行斗争。这时，红旗招展，示威群众高呼口号。
    这时候岸信介政府出动了五千名武装警察以及几十辆装甲车和卡车布置在环绕国会围墙的马路上。警察的扩音器高声嘶叫着，扬言要以武力来对付示威者，并且要求他们散开。但是工人和学生的歌声淹没了警察的吼叫。
    到了晚上九点三十分，三万名示威群众在国会围墙后面的马路上举行了抗议大会。宽广的道路上挤满了拿着旗帜的工人和学生。
    慷慨激昂老年诗人出壮语
    前途光辉人民斗争定胜利
    社会党国会议员山花秀雄和赤松勇、共产党众议员志贺义雄和“安全条约批判会”代表、女诗人深尾须磨子在会上讲了话。他们在讲话中都强调国会外面的人民的力量现在必须大力支持反对党议员在国会进行的斗争。
    志贺义雄说，社会党和共产党在国会斗争中紧紧地团结在一起，他号召示威者把斗争进行到底。六十五岁的女诗人深尾须磨子高声说：“利用今天晚上聚集在那里的人民的力量，我们能够推翻岸信介政府。日本人民有着光辉的前途。”
    在他们发言过程中，斗志昂扬的示威者高呼：“我们已准备好！”，“让我们通宵进行斗争！”愤怒的群众在国会周围举行了示威，然后在大街上举行了游行。他们通宵地进行斗争，直到20日早晨三点多钟，示威者才回到他们的工作地点，为当天的更大规模的抗议批准日美军事同盟条约的斗争进行准备。
