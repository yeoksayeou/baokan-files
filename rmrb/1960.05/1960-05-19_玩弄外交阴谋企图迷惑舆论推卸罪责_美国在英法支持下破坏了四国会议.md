Xinhua News Agency, Paris, May 18th: U.S. President Eisenhower, with the cooperation of French President De Gaulle and British Prime Minister Macmillan, engaged in intense activities here on the 17th, orchestrating yet another diplomatic conspiracy. Ultimately, they destroyed the opportunity to hold a Four-Power Summit.

At 10:00 AM (local time) on the 17th, Eisenhower, Macmillan, and De Gaulle held a meeting. Following the talks, Western spokesmen abruptly announced shortly after 12:00 PM that De Gaulle had invited the heads of state of the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain to hold a Four-Power Summit at the Élysée Palace at 3:00 PM that afternoon.

When the West announced De Gaulle's invitation, Khrushchev's delegation was touring the town of Pleurs-sur-Marne, 120 kilometers from Paris. It was only during the tour that Khrushchev's delegation learned of the news.

According to the West, De Gaulle's invitation letter deliberately used ambiguous language, stating that the meeting was to study issues, without specifying what kind of meeting it was. On the 16th, De Gaulle, in his capacity as chairman of the preparatory meeting, had suggested that the 17th be a day for considering the statements of the heads of government. In the invitation letter, he did not specify whether the meeting was a preparatory meeting to be held again at the end of the "consideration" day, or an attempt to unilaterally convene a formal meeting. U.S. Presidential Spokesman Hagerty's statement, issued shortly after 2:00 PM, revealed the truth of this trap. The statement said that Eisenhower "understands from President De Gaulle's invitation" that the meeting held on the afternoon of the 17th "will be a formal session of the summit conference," and that "the President of the United States accepts (De Gaulle's) invitation with the understanding that the Soviet representative's acceptance of the same invitation to attend this meeting will constitute his withdrawal of those conditions that have been rejected by the President."

Shortly after 2:00 PM, Khrushchev returned to the Soviet Embassy in Paris and received De Gaulle's letter. Khrushchev then asked the French side to clarify the nature of the meeting to be convened. This request was conveyed by telephone, but no reply was received.

As 3:00 PM approached, both Eisenhower and Macmillan went to the Élysée Palace, where De Gaulle was located. Khrushchev did not go.

The Soviet side released a statement by Khrushchev to reporters regarding Hagerty's remarks. In this statement, Khrushchev said that he was willing to hold a meeting with the heads of state of the three Western powers to exchange views on whether the conditions for starting the summit conference had been formed. Khrushchev reiterated that the Soviet Union would only participate in the formal summit if the United States fulfilled the guarantee conditions proposed by the Soviet Union.

From 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM, Eisenhower, Macmillan, and De Gaulle stayed in the Élysée Palace for two hours. Their trap failed. Finally, the French delegation had to issue a communique stating that it "noted that the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union did not participate. General De Gaulle pointed out that, in this situation, the planned discussion could not proceed." At the invitation of British Foreign Secretary Lloyd, Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko held talks with Lloyd shortly after 6:00 PM.

Shortly after 9:00 PM on the 17th, the heads of state of the three Western powers gathered again at the Élysée Palace for talks. After the talks, the three countries issued a joint statement sabotaging the summit conference, declaring that it was "impossible to begin reviewing at the summit conference the various issues that had been previously agreed could be discussed between the four heads of state or government." The statement stubbornly placed the responsibility for sabotaging the meeting on the Soviet Union, saying that this was "due to the attitude adopted by the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union." U.S. Presidential Spokesman Hagerty also said at a press conference that President Eisenhower believed that the summit conference was over. At this point, the United States, with the support of Britain and France, finally sabotaged the highly anticipated Four-Power Summit.

Just as the press group accompanying the Soviet delegation pointed out in a statement issued on the evening of the 17th, no matter what diplomatic tricks the U.S. government uses to confuse public opinion, it will ultimately not escape the responsibility for sabotaging the Four-Power Summit. The world's fair-minded people know very well that it was the U.S. government, with its act of aggression against the Soviet Union on the eve of the summit and its arrogant refusal to abandon this action, that undermined this Four-Power Summit.

### 玩弄外交阴谋企图迷惑舆论推卸罪责  美国在英法支持下破坏了四国会议

    玩弄外交阴谋企图迷惑舆论推卸罪责
    美国在英法支持下破坏了四国会议
    新华社巴黎18日电　美国总统艾森豪威尔在法国总统戴高乐和英国首相麦克米伦合作下，17日在这里进行了紧张的活动，安排下一个外交阴谋。最后破坏了举行四国政府首脑会议的机会。
    17日上午十时（当地时间），艾森豪威尔、麦克米伦和戴高乐开会。会谈结束后，西方发言人在中午十二时多猝然宣布，戴高乐已经邀请苏、美、英三国首脑下午三时在爱丽舍宫举行四国政府首脑会议。
    在西方宣布戴高乐发出邀请的时候，赫鲁晓夫一行正在离开巴黎一百二十公里的普勒—休尔—马恩镇游览，只是在游览的过程中，赫鲁晓夫一行才知道这个消息。
    据西方公布，戴高乐邀请开会的信中，故意含糊其词地说要开会来研究问题，没有说明开的是什么会。戴高乐16日曾以预备会议主席身份建议的17日是对政府首脑的声明进行考虑的日子。在邀请信中他没有指明会议是“考虑”日结束时再次举行的预备会议，还是试图单方面召开正式会议。美国总统发言人哈格蒂在下午二时多发表的声明揭开了这个圈套的真相。声明说，艾森豪威尔从“戴高乐总统的邀请中了解”，17日下午举行的会议“将是最高级会议的一次正式会议”，“美国总统接受（戴高乐）这一邀请是这样认为的：苏联代表的接受出席这次会议的同样邀请将构成他撤销那些已为总统所拒绝的条件”。
    下午二时多，赫鲁晓夫回到巴黎的苏联大使馆，收到戴高乐的信。赫鲁晓夫便请法国方面指明要召开的会议的性质，这项请求通过电话转达过去，却没有接到回答。
    下午临近三时，艾森豪威尔和麦克米伦都到戴高乐所在的爱丽舍宫去了。赫鲁晓夫没有去。
    苏联方面公布了赫鲁晓夫就哈格蒂谈话对记者发表的一项声明。赫鲁晓夫在这项声明中说，他愿意同西方三国首脑举行就是否已形成了开始举行最高级会议的条件而交换意见的会议。赫鲁晓夫再次强调，只有美国实现了苏联所提出的保证条件，苏联才愿意参加正式的首脑会议。
    从下午三时到五时，艾森豪威尔、麦克米伦和戴高乐在爱丽舍宫里呆了两个小时。他们的圈套落空了。最后，法国代表团不得不发表公报说，“注意到了苏联部长会议主席没有参加。戴高乐将军指出，在这种情况下，原定的讨论便无法进行。”由于英国外交大臣劳埃德的邀请，苏联外交部长葛罗米柯在下午六时多同劳埃德举行了会谈。
    17日晚间九时多，西方三国首脑又齐集爱丽舍宫会谈。会谈结束后，三国发表破坏首脑会议的联合声明，宣称已经“不可能在最高级会议上开始审查先前一致同意可以在四个国家元首或政府首脑之间加以讨论的各项问题”。声明硬把破坏会议的责任推到苏联身上，说什么这是“由于苏联部长会议主席采取的态度”。美国总统发言人哈格蒂并且在记者招待会上说，艾森豪威尔总统认为最高级会议已经结束。至此，美国在英国和法国支持下终于破坏了举世瞩目的四国政府首脑会议。
    正像苏联代表团随行记者组在17日晚间发表的声明所指出的，不论美国政府使用什么样的外交手腕来迷惑舆论，它终究逃不出破坏四国首脑会议的责任。世界公正的人们知道得很清楚，正是美国政府以它在首脑会议前夕对苏联的侵略行动和蛮横地拒绝放弃这种行动，破坏了这次四国政府首脑会议。
