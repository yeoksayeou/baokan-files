Xinhua News Agency, 6th dispatch: The production of vegetables in urban and rural areas across the country has seen considerable development this spring. Currently, the sowing of summer vegetables is nearing completion in southern regions, while northern regions are vigorously sowing and planting summer vegetables. The spring sowing area for vegetables has generally expanded compared to last year, and the variety of vegetables has also increased significantly.

This spring, all regions have been focusing on vegetable production, starting early, planting extensively, and planting more. According to incomplete statistics from twelve provinces and cities including Beijing, Shandong, Henan, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Shanxi, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Hebei, Shaanxi, and Gansu, as of late April, over 16 million mu of spring and summer vegetables (excluding fodder crops) have already been sown. Among them, Guangdong Province has already exceeded its spring sowing target for vegetables by 24%.

Since the issuance of the "Instructions on Current Vegetable Work" jointly issued by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council on February 18, all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have made unified arrangements and deployments for this year's vegetable production under the guidance of the principle of taking grain as the key link and making comprehensive arrangements. This year, the cultivated land area used for vegetable production across the country will increase by more than 20% compared to 1959, among which thirty-two large and medium-sized cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Wuhan will increase by about 30% compared to 1959. The development of vegetable production this year is reflected in the following aspects: First, all cities and industrial and mining areas have established and expanded production bases for commercial vegetables in the people's communes in the suburbs; second, the public canteens of the vast majority of rural people's communes have established their own vegetable gardens, developing self-sufficient vegetable production; third, many institutions, schools, industrial and mining enterprises in many regions have also started growing their own vegetables; fourth, rural people's communes in various provinces and regions have mobilized the masses to plant a large amount of fodder crops such as pumpkins on idle small plots of land, and Gansu, Shaanxi and other provinces are still continuing to plant extensively special species.

This year's spring sowing work for vegetables, whether in terms of early start, large quantity, or high quality, generally exceeds previous years. The sowing of spring and summer vegetables in various regions generally started about ten to fifteen days earlier than last year. All regions have paid special attention to improving and increasing the variety of vegetables. Shenyang City's vegetable production this year will reach eighty-four species and three hundred and thirty varieties, an increase of thirty-nine species and two hundred and twenty varieties compared to 1959. Harbin City will increase from more than six hundred varieties last year to more than one thousand varieties.

(Reported by our newspaper) Party organizations at all levels in Henan Province are focusing on vegetable production with the same effort as they focus on grain production. Up to now, the province has sown spring vegetables averaging more than one fen of land per person. In some areas, the average is more than two fen per person. The task of fully utilizing idle land and planting an average of twenty pumpkin seedlings per person, proposed by the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, has now been completed ahead of schedule and exceeded. Due to meticulous management, winter vegetables have generally had a bumper harvest, and spring vegetables have been marketed early, resulting in a good situation for both self-consumption and supply of vegetables in rural and urban areas.

In vegetable production, party committees at all levels, in accordance with the instructions of the provincial committee, have grasped grain and vegetables with equal emphasis, with secretaries taking the lead at all levels. They have established vegetable production leading bodies, formulated plans, fixed labor, organized year-round vegetable production professional teams, and established year-round vegetable production bases. At the same time, they have mobilized the masses to fully utilize barren hills and vacant land to grow vegetables. In Xichuan County, in addition to establishing permanent vegetable plots, the vast number of commune members have, according to the characteristics of the mountainous area, vigorously developed pumpkin hills. Now, seven hundred and twenty-eight hills, ridges, and slopes throughout the county have been planted with pumpkins, averaging one hundred pumpkin seedlings per person in the county.

In order to ensure the planting area for vegetables, party organizations at all levels have recently conducted inspections and acceptance of the planting situation of vegetables on a commune-by-commune, team-by-team, and plot-by-plot basis, in conjunction with the current production. After the inspection, Xinxiang Prefecture revised its original plan of planting one million mu of vegetables to two million mu. According to the characteristics of the changeable spring climate, Hua County took many measures to prevent wind, frost, pests and diseases, drought and flood. After eight days of intensive work, the county erected more than seven thousand six hundred and eighty windbreaks in vegetable fields and wove more than seventeen thousand eight hundred grass coats. All vegetable fields were top-dressed and watered once for root setting. Now, more than ten thousand mu of vegetable seedlings are green and growing well, and the harvest time has been greatly advanced.

Various regions have created many experiences in increasing vegetable production. Ren Zhenzhong, secretary of the Party Branch of Renjiazhuang Brigade of Liaohe Commune in Nanyang County, and Li Fuyuan, an old vegetable farmer with more than 20 years of vegetable growing experience, jointly created a rapid-growth and high-yield method for leafy vegetables such as Chinese cabbage, black and white cabbage, and Swiss chard to emerge in three days, be edible in half a month, and be harvested in twenty-five days by innovating vegetable cultivation and management techniques. Using this method, one mu of land can be harvested more than ten times a year, with each harvest yielding about 4,000 jin of vegetables, shortening the growing period by more than half compared to general cultivation methods. These experiences have now been promoted throughout the province. (Attached picture)

    抓紧蔬菜生产旺季　大种特种夏菜
    全国种菜面积将增加20％　十二省市已种菜一千六百万亩
    河南像抓粮食一样抓蔬菜全省每人有菜地一分多
    据新华社6日讯　全国城乡今春的蔬菜生产都有较大的发展。现在，南方各地的夏菜播种工作将近尾声，北方各地正在大播和栽种夏菜。蔬菜的春播面积普遍比去年有所扩大，而且品种也增加很多。
    今春各地对蔬菜生产都抓得紧，抓得早，种得多。据北京、山东、河南、辽宁、黑龙江、山西、江苏、江西、广东、河北、陕西、甘肃等十二个省市到4月下旬的不完全统计，已经播种春、夏菜一千六百多万亩（不包括饲料菜）。其中，广东省已经超额24％完成了蔬菜春播任务。
    从2月18日中共中央和国务院联合发出“关于当前蔬菜工作的指示”以后，各省市区在以粮为纲全面安排的方针指导下，对今年的蔬菜生产都作了统一安排和布置。今年全国各地用于蔬菜生产的耕地面积将比1959年增加20％以上，其中北京、上海、天津、武汉等三十二个大中城市将比1959年增加30％左右。今年蔬菜生产的发展表现在以下几个方面，一、各城市、工矿区都在郊区的人民公社建立和扩大了商品菜的生产基地；二、绝大多数农村人民公社的公共食堂建立了自己的菜园，发展了自给性的蔬菜生产；三、不少地区的机关、学校、工矿企业也动手自己种菜；四、各省区农村人民公社发动群众大种闲散小块土地，种了大量的南瓜等饲料菜，现在甘肃、陕西等省还在继续大种特种。
    今年的蔬菜春播工作，无论就动手之早、数量之多、质量之高一般都超过了往年。各地的春夏菜播种工作，一般都比去年提早十至十五天左右。各地都特别注意到改良和增加蔬菜的品种。沈阳市今年蔬菜生产将达八十四种三百三十个品种，比1959年增加三十九种二百二十个品种，哈尔滨市在去年六百多个品种的基础上，将增加到一千多个品种。
    本报讯　河南省各级党组织用像抓粮食生产一样的劲头，狠抓蔬菜生产。到目前为止，全省已播种春菜平均每人已达一分多地。部分地区平均每人种菜两分多。中共河南省委提出的充分利用空闲地每人平均种二十窝南瓜的任务，现在也已提前超额完成。由于管理精细，冬菜普遍丰收，春菜提早上市，农村和城市蔬菜的自食和供应情况都出现了良好的局面。
    在蔬菜生产中，各级党委都根据省委指示，一手抓粮，一手抓菜，层层有书记挂帅，并且建立了蔬菜生产领导机构，普遍制订了计划，固定劳力，组织常年的蔬菜生产专业队，建立了常年的蔬菜生产基地，同时还发动群众充分利用荒山空地种菜。淅川县广大社员，除在普遍建立了常年菜地外，还根据山区特点，大搞南瓜山，现在全县七百二十八个山头、山岭和山坡，都普遍种上了南瓜，全县平均每人一百窝。
    为保证蔬菜生产的种植面积，各级党组织最近结合当前生产，对蔬菜的种植情况，进行了逐社、逐队、逐块的检查验收。新乡专区在检查以后，把原来种菜一百万亩的计划，增订为二百万亩。滑县根据春天气候变化多端的特点，采取了许多防风、防霜冻、防病虫害、防旱涝等措施，经过八天突击，全县在菜田内打起风障七千六百八十多道，织草衫一万七千八百多条，所有菜田都施了一遍追肥和浇了一次定根水，现在，十多万亩菜苗一片油绿，生长良好，收获时间大大提前。
    各地创造了许多增产蔬菜的经验。南阳县潦河公社任家庄大队党支部书记任振中和有二十多年种菜经验的老菜农李付元通过革新蔬菜栽培、管理技术，共同创造了白菜、黑白菜、莙达菜等叶菜三天出苗、半月能吃、二十五天即可收获的速生丰产法，采用这种方法，一亩地一年可收十几次，每亩每次收菜四千斤左右，比一般栽培方法，缩短生长期一半多。这些经验，现在已在全省进行了推广。（附图片）
