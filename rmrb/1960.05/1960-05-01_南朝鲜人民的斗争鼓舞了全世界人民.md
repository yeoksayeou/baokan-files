Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 29th: About 10,000 people from all walks of life in Hanoi held a rally at the People's Theatre tonight to support the South Korean people's struggle against the Syngman Rhee clique and American imperialism.

Those present at tonight's gathering included: Truong Chinh and Pham Hung, members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party; Ton Duc Thang, Chairman of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front; Phan Ke Toai, Deputy Prime Minister; Le Dinh Tham, Chairman of the Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace; and Nguyen Thi Thuc Vien, Vice Chairman of the Vietnam Asian-African People's Solidarity Committee.

Chon Chang-chol, Ambassador of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to Vietnam, was invited to attend the rally.

Hoang Quoc Viet, member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front and Chairman of the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor, delivered a speech at the meeting. He said that the profound roots of the South Korean people's uprising are the Syngman Rhee clique's fascist dictatorial system and American imperialism's policy of occupation, enslavement, and division of Korea.

Hoang Quoc Viet then spoke about the dark and bleak situation in South Korea, which is similar to that in South Vietnam. He emphasized that the darkness and misery in South Korea were also created by American imperialism.

Hoang Quoc Viet pointed out that in order to shirk its responsibility for the current situation in South Korea, American imperialism is putting on an act, attempting to deceive public opinion, as if it has nothing to do with the events of enslaving and massacring the South Korean people.

Hoang Quoc Viet said that we, the Vietnamese people, have long seen through the ugly and cunning face of American imperialism. We want to angrily point out that the South Korean people's fifteen years of suffering have all been brought about by American imperialism, and the current situation in South Korea is created by American imperialism.

Hoang Quoc Viet continued, saying that the victory currently won by the South Korean people is a powerful blow to American imperialism's aggression in the Far East, further exposing and isolating the true face of American imperialism. This struggle has made the running dogs of American imperialism in the world even more panic-stricken and further promoted the struggle movement against American imperialism and its running dogs around the world. He said that the struggle of the South Korean people is shaking the world and South Vietnam. The initial victory of the South Korean people is also a victory for the people of the world and the Vietnamese people.

Chon Chang-chol, Ambassador of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to Vietnam, then spoke at the meeting, thanking the Vietnamese people for their enthusiastic support for the South Korean people. He pointed out that the South Korean people standing up like angry lions and the collapse of the Syngman Rhee traitorous clique are the inevitable result of American imperialism's fifteen years of enslavement of South Korea. He demanded that American imperialism, this wolf in human skin, must immediately get out of South Korea along with the weapons they have illegally brought in. He said that the shameful consequences brought to them by the American aggressive policy in South Korea give reason to believe that the future of the South Vietnamese traitorous clique, which is thoroughly supported by American aggressors, is also bleak.

Vietnamese labor hero Le Minh Duc and Yang Van Yit, secretary of the Vietnam University Students' Union, also spoke at the meeting.

The conference unanimously adopted a resolution condemning the barbarous persecution by American imperialism and its running dogs in South Korea, demanding that the American troops must immediately withdraw from South Korea; let the North and South Korean people solve the problem of the division of their country by themselves, hold free general elections throughout the country, and no foreign country should interfere.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 30th: The Presidium of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement on the 28th, warmly supporting the just struggle of the South Korean people. The statement emphasized that the root cause of all the misfortunes and sufferings of the South Korean people is the occupation of South Korean by the troops of American imperialism. The statement said that as long as American imperialism continues to occupy South Korea, there will be no democratic politics in South Korea, and the demands of the South Korean people cannot be realized.

The statement accused American imperialism of not only instigating the Syngman Rhee puppet regime in the past to provoke the Korean War, killing countless Korean people, and turning Korea into ruins, but also now transporting nuclear weapons into South Korea, conspiring to seize the opportunity to "advance north."

The statement pointed out that facing the outbreak of the South Korean people's angry flames, American imperialism, in order to shift the South Korean people's target of opposition to American imperialism, is shouting deceptive slogans of "democracy" and "freedom" and organizing a new puppet regime. The statement pointed out that no matter who forms the new puppet regime, the flames of the Korean people's struggle will continue to expand until the peaceful reunification of North and South Korea is realized.

The statement said that only by forcing the withdrawal of American troops from South Korea and peacefully reunifying North and South Korea by the Korean people themselves can all the demands of the South Korean people for democracy and life be realized. Similarly, the Japanese people's aspirations for peace, independence, democracy, and neutrality can only be guaranteed by forcing American troops to withdraw from Japan and abolish American military bases in Japan and return Okinawa Island.

The statement emphasized that the struggle of the South Korean people gives encouragement and confidence in victory to the Japanese people who are fighting to prevent the ratification and strive for the abolition of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." The Japanese people, through the struggle against the common enemy of the people of Japan and Korea—American imperialism—will unite more closely with the Korean people.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 30th: The Soviet "Pravda" today published an observer article commenting on the patriotic and just struggle of the South Korean people.

The article said that the United States established a puppet regime in South Korea and has consistently supported this regime with bayonets and dollars. Some American groups should bear direct responsibility for the tragic situation of South Korean society.

The article said that during the years of foreign occupation, South Korea's economy has become a typical colonial appendage economy, and South Korea has become a police state politically, becoming a military base for the United States on the Asian continent. The United States has established eleven military bases here and stationed troops.

The article pointed out that the people's patience has reached its limit. South Korean patriots resolutely oppose the traitorous policy. The angry tide of the people swept away Syngman Rhee and his accomplices.

The article said that now, the reactionary forces, regardless of the will of the people, are attempting to maintain the system hated by the people in South Korea, placing puppets as submissive as Syngman Rhee in the position of national leaders. The South Korean ruling clique and their foreign masters are actively consolidating their positions. However, the article pointed out that life has long proved that the policy of supporting anti-people puppet regimes pursued by some Western groups will inevitably fail everywhere. In our era, it is impossible to try to stifle the people's will for freedom and independence with dictatorship and foreign bayonets.

The article emphasized that the entire Korean people resolutely oppose the tricks of deceiving the Korean people and world opinion. Millions of Korean people demand first and foremost an end to foreign occupation, demand that foreign occupiers stop interfering in South Korean affairs, and give the people democratic, free, and legitimate rights to solve their own problems.

专栏：

    南朝鲜人民的斗争鼓舞了全世界人民
    黄国越在河内万人大会上说全世界反对美帝国主义的斗争必将进一步高涨
    日共中央的声明说为反对日美军事条约而斗争的日本人民增强了胜利信心
    苏联“真理报”说西方某些集团扶持反人民傀儡制度的政策将到处遭到失败
    新华社河内29日电　河内各界人民约一万人今晚在人民剧场举行大会，支持南朝鲜人民反对李承晚集团和美帝国主义的斗争。
    出席今晚集会的有：越南劳动党中央政治局委员长征、范雄，越南祖国战线中央委员会主席团主席孙德胜，副总理潘继遂，越南保卫世界和平委员会主席黎廷探，越南亚非人民团结委员会副主席阮氏淑媛等。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国驻越南大使全昌哲应邀出席了大会。
    越南祖国战线中央委员会主席团委员、越南总工会主席黄国越在会上发表了讲话。他说，南朝鲜人民起义的深远根源是李承晚集团的法西斯独裁制度和美帝国主义的占领、奴役和分裂朝鲜的政策。
    黄国越接着谈到南朝鲜同南越一样暗无天日的情况。他强调指出，南朝鲜的黑暗和惨相也是美帝国主义制造出来的。
    黄国越指出，美帝国主义为了推卸它对南朝鲜目前局势的责任，故作姿态，妄图蒙蔽舆论，好像它同奴役、屠杀南朝鲜人民的事件是毫不相关似的。
    黄国越说，我们越南人民早就看透了美帝国主义的丑恶的奸滑的嘴脸，我们要愤怒地指出，南朝鲜人民十五年的苦痛都是美帝国主义给带来的，目前的南朝鲜局势，就是美帝国主义制造出来的。
    黄国越接着说，南朝鲜人民当前所争取得的胜利有力地打击了美帝国主义在远东的侵略行为，促使美帝国主义的真面目更加暴露和更加孤立。这一斗争使得世界上的美帝国主义走狗更加惊惶失措，并进一步推动了全世界反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争运动。他说，南朝鲜人民的斗争正在震动全世界和南越。南朝鲜人民的初步胜利也是世界人民和越南人民的胜利。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国驻越南大使全昌哲接着在大会上讲话，他感谢越南人民对南朝鲜人民热情支持。他指出，南朝鲜人民有如怒狮般地站了起来以及李承晚卖国贼的垮台，正是美帝国主义十五年来奴役南朝鲜的必然结果。他要求美帝国主义这只披着人皮的狼必须连同他们非法运入的武器立即滚出南朝鲜。他说，美国在南朝鲜的侵略政策给他们带来的可耻后果，令人有理由断定：彻头彻尾由美国侵略者扶植的南越卖国集团，前程也是不妙的。
  越南劳动英雄黎明德和越南大学生联合会秘书杨文逸也在会上发表了讲话。
    大会最后一致通过决议，谴责美帝国主义及其走狗在南朝鲜的野蛮迫害行径，要求美国军队必须立即撤出南朝鲜；让北、南朝鲜人民自行解决本国被分裂的问题，举行全国范围的自由普选，外国不得加以干涉。
    据新华社30日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央委员会干部会28日发表声明，热烈支持南朝鲜人民的正义斗争。声明着重指出，南朝鲜人民目前所有不幸和痛苦的根源是美帝国主义的军队霸占南朝鲜。声明说，只要美帝国主义仍霸占南朝鲜，南朝鲜就不会出现民主政治，南朝鲜人民的要求也就不能实现。
    声明指责美帝国主义不仅过去指使李承晚傀儡政权挑起朝鲜战争，杀害无数朝鲜人民，使朝鲜变成废墟。并且现在还把核武器运进南朝鲜，阴谋伺机“北进”。
    声明指出，面临着南朝鲜人民愤怒火焰的爆发，美帝国主义为了转移南朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义的目标，正在高喊“民主”和“自由”的欺骗口号，组织新的傀儡政权。声明指出，不管谁来组成新的傀儡政权，朝鲜人民斗争的火焰将越来越扩展，一直到实现南北朝鲜和平统一为止。
    声明说，迫使美军撤出南朝鲜，由朝鲜人民自己的手来和平统一南北朝鲜，只有这样才能实现南朝鲜人民关于民主和生活上的一切要求。同样地，日本人民争取和平、独立、民主和中立的愿望，也只有在迫使美军撤出日本和撤销美国在日本的军事基地，归还冲绳岛的情况下才有保证。
    声明强调指出，南朝鲜人民的斗争对正在为阻止批准和争取废除新的日美“安全条约”而斗争的日本人民给予鼓舞和胜利信心，日本人民通过对日朝两国人民的共同敌人——美帝国主义的斗争，同朝鲜人民更加紧密地团结起来。
    据新华社莫斯科30日电　苏联“真理报”今天刊登了一篇观察家文章，评论南朝鲜人民的爱国正义斗争。
    文章说，美国在南朝鲜建立了傀儡政权，并且经常用刺刀和美元支持这一政权，美国一些集团应对南朝鲜社会的悲惨状况负直接责任。
    文章说，在外国占领年代，南朝鲜的经济变成了典型的殖民地附庸经济，南朝鲜在政治上变成了警察国家，成为美国在亚洲大陆的军事基地。美国在这里建立了十一个军事基地，驻扎了军队。
    文章指出，人民的忍耐已经到了顶点。南朝鲜的爱国者坚决反对卖国政策。人民的愤怒的浪潮卷走了李承晚和他的帮凶们。
    文章说，现在，反动势力不管人民的意志，正企图在南朝鲜保持为人民所憎恨的制度，把同李承晚一样忠顺的傀儡置于国家领导者的地位。南朝鲜统治集团和外国的主子们正在积极巩固它们的阵地。但是，文章指出，生活早已证实，西方某些集团所奉行的扶持反人民的傀儡制度的政策必将到处遭到失败。在我们这个时代，企图利用独裁和外国刺刀来扼杀人民的自由和独立的意志，这是办不到的。
    文章强调指出，全朝鲜人民坚决地反对欺骗朝鲜人民和世界舆论的手腕。千百万朝鲜人民要求首先结束外国占领，要求外国占领者停止干涉南朝鲜事务，给人民以解决自己事情的民主、自由和合法的权利。（附图片）
