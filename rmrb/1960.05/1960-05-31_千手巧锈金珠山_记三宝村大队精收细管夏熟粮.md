    Thousand Hands Weave Golden Bead Mountain
    ——A Record of the Sanbao Village Brigade's Careful Harvesting and Management of Summer Grain
    ·Jiangsu Jiangyin County Correspondence Group·
    What we see here is a vivid scene of a brigade's meticulous harvesting and management of summer grain.
    On May 21st, we visited the summer grain harvesting and management work of the Sanbao Village Brigade in Xishiqiao Commune, Jiangyin County. In the May fields, golden wheat waves glittered, harvesting and planting crowds, the joy of harvest, soaring enthusiasm, everywhere was a scene of joy and boiling activity.
    Stepping into the land of this brigade, everything seen was so inspiring. On the walls, trees, and road signs, everywhere was written: "Ensure that every grain of grain returns to the granary, every piece of firewood is stacked, and no straw or husk is lost, to ensure a bumper harvest," "Cherish grain like gold, every grain must be fought for"... While working, the commune members were also discussing how to ensure a bumper harvest of summer crops this year, and how to harvest and manage them well. Whether harvesting, transporting, threshing, or gleaning, men, women, old and young, everywhere were reminding and spurring each other, never forgetting careful harvesting and management.
    At the farm of the Fourth Team, eight female commune members from the field harvesting and transportation group used their after-meal rest time to help the threshing group at the farmyard. Although their group leader, Mei Qinmei, personally led them, the farmyard group leader, Mei Xiuying, was still not assured of the quality. She carried the threshing flail, working while watching everyone's quality. However, everyone was working very energetically and cleanly. After watching for half an hour, no flaws were found. Mei Xiuying couldn't help but happily shout: "You are doing really well!" "Everything must go to a higher level, how can we not do our own things well!" Everyone answered in this way. The men, women, old and young harvesting in the fields, everyone could be called a vanguard in returning every grain home. The elderly commune members who tied the wheat sheaves changed the old habit of using wheat to tie wheat, and gently tied the wheat with firewood. The young commune members carrying the wheat also held the loads high, being careful not to let the ears of wheat drag on the ground. Groups of children, led by their teachers, carefully searched for every ear of wheat that fell on the ground in the harvested wheat fields. In the wheat fields interplanted with crops, when they found ears of wheat covered, they reached in and pulled them out. A young commune member, Mei Zhichun, carrying a load of river mud, found a broad bean pod half-covered by a mud clod on the wheat ridge. He quickly bent down and picked it up, saying, "This is also the sweat of labor!" After such careful harvesting and transportation, although there were already very few grains of wheat on the road, Cai Meidi and six or seven other old grandmothers still held brooms and dustpans, searching and sweeping all the way, not letting a single grain of wheat be lost.
    Walking onto the farmyard, the wide fields were as smooth as mirrors. In the yard, stood eye-catching signs: "Straw Stacking Area," "Hay Stacking Area." Piles of wheat, hay, and straw were stacked very neatly. Each pile was marked with a sign, indicating the area, variety... The women threshing in the field were threshing with embroidery-like precision, each ear of wheat being threshed two or three times, and each pile of straw being carefully winnowed five or six times. Although the effort was much greater than in previous years, they still had to carefully search with their own eyes, fearing that any grain would be missed. In the evening, everyone prepared to clean up the battlefield and weigh the grain threshed that day into the warehouse. At this time, on the threshing ground of the Fourth Team, a barefoot young man walked over. This was Wang Hanrong, the secretary of the brigade's Party branch, coming to inspect. After carefully inspecting each pile of grain, grass, and straw, he especially walked up to the female commune member Wang Jindi to see how the quality of her threshing was this year, as she was the one who threshed the roughest during last year's summer harvest. Finally, he nodded with satisfaction and said to Wang Jindi, "Your progress is not slow!" Wang Jindi blushed and replied, "Everyone else is making great leaps forward, how can I lag behind for a lifetime!".
    Then to the warehouse, the doors of each warehouse were marked with red numbers and letters, and labeled: "Regular Warehouse," "Temporary Warehouse," "Finished Product Warehouse," "Straw Warehouse." The houses of these warehouses were not leaking rain, nor damp underneath, with complete doors and windows, no holes or cracks, the interior neat and tidy, with six sides shining. Each pile was marked with a sign indicating the variety and quantity. On the walls were written the warehouse keeper's rules, posted tool and equipment record cards, and hung record books. Pieces of repaired and disinfected tools were neatly placed aside. Leaving the warehouse, it was still clean, with no weeds, sewage, garbage, or rubble to be seen.
    It was already 7:30 in the evening, and the fighting people gathered under the lights of the canteen, happily eating dinner. At this time, the acceptance and evaluation team brought good news from the day: Xu Zuquan, Zhang Renfang, and Liu Kundi, three commune members, harvested in the morning and earned half a work point; the grain picking team led by Mei Jijin exceeded the quota by one-third; the threshing competition between the Xu Jinfeng team and the Wang Jinhe team increased work efficiency by 20% to 30% respectively, with the Wang Jinhe team winning...

    千手巧锈金珠山
    ——记三宝村大队精收细管夏熟粮 
    ·江苏江阴县通讯组·
    这里所见到的是一个大队夏熟粮食精收细管的生动场面。
    5月21日，我们参观了江阴县西石桥公社三宝村大队的夏粮收管工作。5月的田野，满眼是金光闪闪的麦浪，收种的人群，丰收的喜悦，冲天干劲，到处是一片欢欣沸腾的景象。
    踏进这个大队的土地，满眼所见，一切是那样激动人心。墙头上，树木上，路牌上，到处写着：“粮食颗粒归仓，柴草根根成垛，秸壳一点不丢，确保丰产丰收”，“惜粮如金，颗粒必争”……社员们一面劳动，一面也都在议论如何保证今年夏熟作物丰产丰收，收好管好。无论是收割的还是运输的、脱粒的还是拾穗的，男女老幼到处都是彼此嘱咐，互相鞭策，念念不忘精收细管。
    在第四小队的农场上，田头收割运输组的八个女社员，利用饭后休息时间帮助场头组打麦。虽有她们的组长梅芹妹亲自带领着，但是，场头组长梅秀英还是对质量不能放心，她提着打麦的槤枷，一边干活，一边注视着每人的质量。可是，所有的人都干得十分起劲，十分干净利落，看了半个钟点，没有发现半点毛病。梅秀英不禁高兴地喊道：“干得真行呀！”“样样都要更上一层楼，自己的事还能办不好！”大家这样地回答着。在田间收割的男女老幼，人人都称得起是夏收颗粒归家的尖兵，捆麦的老年社员改变了历来用麦捆麦的老习惯，用柴草轻轻地捆着麦子。挑麦的壮年社员，也都把担子举得高高的，留心不让麦穗拖地。一群群孩子，在老师带领下，在已收割的麦田里，仔细地搜索着每一个落在地上的麦穗。在套种着庄稼的麦田里，发现有麦穗被盖没了，他们便伸进手去，把它拉出来。一个挑着河泥担的青年社员梅志春，在麦埨上发现一个被泥块盖了半截的蚕豆荚，他忙弯下腰把它拾起来，一边说：“这也是劳动的血汗呀！”经过这样的精收细运，路上的麦粒虽然已是很少了，但是，蔡美娣等六、七位老奶奶，还是手拿扫帚、?箕，一路找着、扫着，不让一粒麦丢失。
    走上场头，一片片宽大的场地平滑如镜。场上，竖着一块块夺目的牌子：“秸壳堆放处”，“堆草处”。一个个麦堆、草堆、秸壳堆，堆放得十分整齐。每个堆上插着牌子，分别标着面积、品种……打场的妇女们，一个个以绣花的精工在脱粒，每一个麦穗都分别打过两三次，每一堆秸壳都细细扬过五、六遍。虽然，功夫比往年深得多了，但是，他们还要再用自己的眼睛仔细搜索一遍，深怕有麦粒被滑过去。傍晚，大家准备收拾战场，并把一天脱粒的粮食过秤入仓。这时，第四小队的晒场上，走来了一位赤脚的壮年人。这是大队党支部书记王汉荣来验收了。他在细细检查了每一堆粮、草、秸壳以后，又特别走到女社员王金娣跟前，细看这位去年夏收的时候脱粒最粗糙的人，今年脱粒的质量如何。最后，他满意地点着头，对王金娣说：“你的进步不慢呀！”王金娣红着脸颊回答道：“人家都大跃进，我还能一辈子落后！”。
    再到仓库，每个仓库的大门，都编着红色的字号，并分别标着：“常备仓库”、“临时仓库”、“成品仓库”、“秸壳仓库”。这些仓库的房屋，是上不漏雨，下不潮湿，门窗俱全，无洞无缝，室内整整齐齐，六面发光。每个囤堆子上，都插着标明品种、数量的牌子。墙壁上，写着保管员守则，贴着工具、用具记录卡，挂着记事簿。一件件经过整修和消毒的工具，都整齐地放置一旁。走出仓库，仍然是一片清洁，一点儿看不到杂草、污水、垃圾、瓦砾。
    已经是晚上七点半钟了，战斗的人们聚集在食堂的灯光下，愉快地吃着晚餐。这时，验收评比小组送来了一天的喜讯：徐祖泉、张仁方、刘坤娣三个社员，早晨收割一早抵半工；拾粮队员梅纪尽等超过定额三分之一；场头许金凤小组和王金和小组脱粒竞赛，工效分别提高20％到30％，王金和小组获胜……。
