	The Infinite Goodness of Urban People's Communes
	-- On the Growth of the Chunshu People's Commune in Xuanwu District, Beijing
	By Our Staff Reporter

	Early in the morning, people streamed from street factories, canteens, nurseries, and service stations towards the newly decorated meeting place. It was a joyous day for the first congress of commune members of the Chunshu People's Commune in Xuanwu District, Beijing. How happy they were! Old Mother Chen Xinzhu, the administrator of the Yongguang Temple Street Canteen, and her husband, the deputy station chief at the service station, arrived early. Luan Yaokui, a mother of five, sat on the rostrum wearing three medals. Advanced producers Jiang Shuyu and Ma Huiping set off firecrackers in front of the venue. They, these housewives who had spent so many years around the stove, were changing themselves and the entire residential area through labor practice in just seventeen short months.

	Ripe for the Picking

	This commune was established a year and a half ago. In reality, the seeds of the commune idea had been sown much earlier. At that time, the wave of the All-People Rectification Movement swept through the streets. Residents engaged in extensive airing of views, big debates. Women, through comparing the old and new societies, engaged in debates about the two roads of socialism and capitalism. The debate began with the question of whether buying things was convenient. The debate meetings became more and more heated, and people were reluctant to disperse even when it was almost time for dinner. Twenty-one households in Cotton Flower Alley scrambled to speak. Old Mrs. Wang Jingxin said: "In the old society, my family of five slept on a bare mat on the ground. The small house had holes everywhere in the roof and walls. In winter, it snowed outside, and it also snowed inside. Ice stalactites hung all over the walls. The children were so cold that they cried out, but there was nothing we could do but put them in the adults' pants to keep them warm. Six out of our seven children fell ill from cold and hunger. Who would give them medical treatment? We just watched helplessly as they died... After liberation, life got better day by day. New clothes and new bedding were all available. My daughter became a nursery worker, and my grandson has never been without milk or milk cakes since he was born. It's not just our family that's doing well; all working people are doing well. You buy things, I buy things, everyone buys things, so buying things is bound to be a little inconvenient. But is this the same as the inconvenience of not having money to buy things in the past?" As soon as she finished speaking, Yuan Shumin continued: "That's right, back then, my husband pedaled a rickshaw, so tired he couldn't catch his breath, and he couldn't even get a bite to eat. Once, our family hadn't had a pot to cook in for days. Our eight-year-old child picked through the trash, sold some junk, and bought a cake. He couldn't bear to eat it and saved it for me. I told his father to eat it, but his father told the child to eat it. None of us wanted to eat it, and the whole family cried loudly looking at the cake. Back then, the streets were full of people like us, with messy hair, starved until we looked like neither humans nor ghosts, lying on the ground waiting to die. Now, go and see my house. Adults and children have no worries about food, and the child is attending a technical college. Two systems, two lives, one in heaven, one on earth. Which one is convenient?"

	Such a comparison made everyone more clearly recognize a truth: following the Party and Chairman Mao, taking the socialist road, is the right way! But they also raised a question: how can we housewives take this road? They saw the female workers who had taken up jobs earlier and were both envious and anxious.

	At this time, the General Line was announced, the bugle of the Great Leap Forward sounded, a storm of the people's commune movement swept the countryside, the face of the factories changed day by day, production increased many times over, Xuanwu District built a steel factory today and a chemical factory tomorrow, nearly a hundred factories in the district, every factory called for more people, some old factories in Beijing like Shijingshan Iron and Steel Factory also came to the district to ask for people, where to find people? It was the turn of the idle labor force on the streets. The streets were boiling, today a batch of women entered the factory, tomorrow another batch of women became salespersons, everyone's heart also flew out. Some women even dreamed of becoming workers. Some women secretly learned to sell vegetables at home: Cabbage! Scallions, bean sprouts! Many mothers-in-law also said to their daughters-in-law: You go out! I'll take care of the child. Some husbands helped their wives with housework after work to encourage them to participate in production.

	At this time, the street Party committee conveyed the instructions of the higher Party committee: the entire street work should be centered on production.

	A surging wave of production was set off.

	Labor Creates Everything

	Nine women in Chunshu Hutong, who were family members of cadres, carpenters, and tricycle workers, knew that ferrous sulfate, a raw material for pesticides, could be made from waste sulfuric acid and iron filings. They were extremely happy. They said, let's find a way to make some pesticides to support agricultural construction. Several people pooled two yuan and forty cents and borrowed two bellows and two broken pots from their neighbors. Three sanitation workers came overnight to help them build two stoves in an open space after hearing about it. A chemical factory was thus born. Many people on the street saw this as a joke. They said: "Since ancient times, no one has ever seen housewives running a factory!" They ignored these distractions.

	They heard that the Third Nail Factory dumped the waste sulfuric acid after using it, and they also heard that the Third Machinery Factory treated iron filings as waste, so they borrowed a flatbed cart and went to pull it themselves, running back and forth for several miles, covered in sweat, and refused to rest. On the third night, everyone was working hard when suddenly a torrential rain began, soaking them all. No one went to the eaves to take shelter. It wasn't until the water rose to a foot deep and it was impossible to pull the bellows that they went indoors. After working for a few days, the sulfuric acid burned holes in their clothes, but everyone's enthusiasm grew even stronger. Not knowing the thermometer, they measured it with an ordinary ruler; not understanding the technology, they asked an old technician from a chemical factory in Chongwen District to teach them; not knowing how to take notes, they memorized it by rote, piecing it together after class, one sentence from you, one sentence from me. They worked under the sun during the day and under the moon at night, finally boiling out the first pot of ferrous sulfate.

	They went to the Beijing Electrolytic Copper Factory to find waste acid. The comrades at the Electrolytic Copper Factory said that they had waste acid and copper powder and wanted to make copper sulfate, but they couldn't spare the manpower. They asked if the chemical factory could help. They were overjoyed when they heard this and started experimenting as soon as they got back. They failed time and time again. Someone was discouraged. The leaders of the factory said, what is this difficulty compared to the Red Army's Long March across the grasslands and over the snow mountains? Let's be bold and do it. The organization supports you. If you fail ten times, try a hundred times. Hearing this, everyone's energy was renewed, and they made it in no time. Later, the Electrolytic Copper Factory hooked up with them, giving them raw materials on time and receiving products on time. The Beiyuan Chemical Factory learned of this news and also brought hydrochloric acid to them, asking them to process it into purified hydrochloric acid. After the Xinghua Dye Factory handed over the task of making ear dye, they extracted seventy or eighty workers to make chemical indicators, creating seven million yuan of wealth for the country in just half a year.

	Now when people go to the chemical factory, they will see nearly three hundred workers happily working in four workshops. In the workshops are large and small earthen ball pots, earthen spin dryers, and tall, sturdy boilers and acid-resistant pumps. If you visit the new product laboratory, you will also see more than ten products such as ammonium paratungstate. The factory's monthly output value is now not a few thousand or tens of thousands, but four or five hundred thousand yuan.

	Many factories grew up like the chemical factory. For example, the glass factory with more than three hundred people started with two oil lamps; the plastic factory with more than five hundred people was started with a paper cutter. In addition to these factories, the commune recently merged hundreds of various types of production groups into two comprehensive factories, specializing in processing various small industrial products for the market. Women work together to paste paper bags, fold book pages, bind old books, assemble whistles, straighten scrap iron nails... In the past, these women had to take work home because they had many children. Now, with the rapid development of production, the commune's foundation is gradually thickening, collective welfare undertakings are getting better and better, and more and more women are leaving their homes and entering comprehensive factories. After centralized production, work is done faster than before. For example, more than twenty female workers who pasted triangular rulers could only paste more than 50,000 in twenty-five days when they were in the production team. After entering the comprehensive factory, they pasted nearly 50,000 in just one week. In addition, some women who do not want to leave home too far can produce in nearby centralized production groups; some people who are too burdened by housework, such as those who have sick people at home to take care of, can also take work home from the factory. Now, all working people and family members of workers who are willing to participate in production have suitable work to do.

	This residential area, which never heard the sound of motors, now has many new signs: hardware factory, instrument factory, glass factory, paste factory. Iron sheets, steel plates, various raw materials, and glass tubes and instruments to be transported are piled up at the entrance and in the courtyard...

	Now, the entire commune has eighteen decent factories, with three thousand nine hundred and five people participating in production. Among the one hundred and fifty-nine kinds of products produced, there are a wide variety of small products, as well as more sophisticated instruments and beautiful plastic raincoats and handbags...

	A Paradise for Working People

	There is a large courtyard in Shanxi Street, where more than forty families live. In mid-August 1958, a small sewing factory was set up there, with more than sixty women working. Everyone participated in production and was very enthusiastic, but the problem of eating was not solved. Many people got up before dawn to start a fire and cook, and they rushed to work without washing the pot after eating, sometimes even being late. They were busy in the factory all day, and when they got home, they had to work around the stove.

	More than twenty street women activists discussed together: "There is a dilapidated house in the courtyard that no one has lived in for many years. The house is full of cobwebs, and the dust is finger-thick. The room is full of broken bricks and tiles. Why not use it?" After they finished speaking, they started to work. Some moved bricks, some carried soil, and some mixed mud. He Qixin's husband also came to help build the stove. They sang as they worked, making noise all night, more lively than a temple fair. The next day, when more people knew about running the canteen, you sent a knife, I sent a few dollars, and soon pots, bowls, tables, and benches were all sent. The doctor from the street hospital even sent a white coat as a smock for the cook. The canteen opened. In just two days, more than twenty canteens appeared in the twenty streets and alleys of the entire commune.

	With meals settled, everyone was very happy, but there was still a knot in their hearts: adults go to work, and no one takes care of the children at home. They used doorways, courtyards, and their own spare houses to set up the first nurseries. The "little medicine pot" who used to go to the hospital every two or three days gained weight day by day after entering the Shanxi Street Kindergarten. The mother was so happy that she immediately sent her two older children to the kindergarten as well. When the Shanxi Street Breastfeeding Room opened, it took in more than thirty babies. After being in the nursery for more than a month, the babies' weight increased by an average of one kilogram. The parents all said: Our working people's children enjoy more happiness living in the nursery than at home.

	The ideal life that working people have dreamed of for generations is beginning to be realized here: In the early morning, people familiar with old Beijing will immediately feel that the air is fresher than in the past when walking through this residential area. Many families no longer cook their own meals in the morning, and there is much less pungent smoke. In Shanxi Street, Housun Park, and Haibeisi Street, where factories are concentrated, there are three mechanized and semi-mechanized large canteens that can accommodate thousands of people to eat. Within the commune, their positions are like a "品" character. Many small and medium-sized canteens are scattered around them. There are canteens near each factory. Workers can eat after a short walk after get off work. A total of five thousand one hundred people, mostly production personnel and their families, eat in these canteens and in nurseries and kindergartens. At meal times, the cooks in the large canteens ride tricycles to deliver hot steamed buns to the nearby small and medium-sized canteens. In the large canteens, there are collective restaurants, as well as "mother and child restaurants," "Hui restaurants," and "guest meal halls." Some canteens specialize in making soft food for patients, the elderly, and young children, and they also process holiday meals for production personnel according to traditional customs. On holidays and Sundays, more and more families come to the canteen to eat "reunion meals." Near the large canteen, there are shower rooms, distillation rooms, and laundries, comprehensively utilizing the waste steam and waste water from the large canteen's steam boilers. After dinner, the canteen becomes a classroom, meeting place, and club, where people discuss leap forward plans, learn culture, read books, play table tennis, and the loudspeaker broadcasts the joyful songs of the workers' chorus: "The People's Commune is like the sun, with ten thousand golden rays shining in all directions, to turn the world into paradise"... In the evening, when mothers take their children home from the nursery, the street service workers have already cleaned the room spotlessly, and the thermos is filled with water. Many workers hand over the keys to their homes to the service workers, saying that they are "housekeepers."

	Labor is the Most Glorious

	"Labor is glorious, not laboring is shameful" has become the new fashion here. During the day, many homes are locked, and few women carrying vegetable baskets and soy sauce cans are seen. In many residential courtyards, only one or two old people are left to watch the door. Only in the early morning and evening and on Sundays can groups of female workers with handbags, talking and laughing, be seen on the streets. What is spread among the neighborhoods is no longer who is long at Zhang's house and who is short at Li's house, but which girl became a red flag bearer and which sisters attended the hero meeting. When everyone meets, they no longer ask, "Have you eaten?" but often ask each other, "How many products did you complete today?" Advanced producer Jiang Shuyu said with happy tears: In the past, when my husband came home from work, he would shout: "Where is everyone in the house?" Now, he says: "Has the one who goes to work come back?"

	Luan Yaokui's journey from a typical housewife to a Communist Party member is the path that many women in this residential area have already taken and are taking.

	Two years ago, Luan Yaokui was still a housewife who "didn't go out the front door, didn't step out the back door." As soon as she opened her eyes every day, she was busy cooking and washing clothes for her husband and five children, often so busy that she couldn't button her own clothes or wash her face. Even so, her husband still said: "What do you do all day, making the house such a mess!" She thought: I hope I won't be a woman in my next life. Women are not human!

	When production started on the streets, she entered the children's toy factory. At first, her body was in the factory, but her heart was at home. While working, she thought: Are Little Four and Little Five being good today? As soon as the end of work bell rang, she ran home.

	In the factory's political class, everyone recalled and compared the new and old societies. Luan Yaokui thought, now that life is getting better, I think about my small family all day long, forgetting the big family. Is this right? Now that I have taken up the glorious post of building socialism, how can I be loose, absent-minded at work? Thinking this way, half of her homesickness was shaken off. She worked faster and faster, and she produced more and more every day. One day, she noticed that Zhang Duolan was producing less, which made the entire group unable to complete the plan. After discussing with the team leader, she took the work that Zhang Duolan could not finish home and helped her finish it at night. One midnight, raindrops fell from the sky. She thought that the factory yard was full of sawdust, and if it rained and then dried, a lot would be lost. She woke up her three children without hesitation and ran to the factory to clean it up for more than two hours. At the end of last year, Luan Yaokui gloriously joined the Party. Her husband also became particularly considerate of her.

	To be a glorious Communist Party member is the concern of many women in this residential area. Now, eight advanced street women in this commune have joined the Communist Party of China, and the number of women listening to Party lectures has increased from more than twenty in 1958 to more than two hundred.

	This ordinary residential area is undergoing earth-shaking changes in the era of the Great Leap Forward! In the overall goal of the city to transform consumption cities into production cities, due to the establishment of people's communes, like other streets, it has entered a new milestone. The secretary of the commune Party committee said: "Many things have not been done well, and there are many things to do. Now it is just the first step in the Long March."

    城市人民公社无限好
    ——记北京市宣武区椿树人民公社的成长
    本报记者
    一清早，人们就从街道工厂、食堂、托儿所、服务站涌向彩饰一新的会场。这是北京宣武区椿树人民公社举行第一次社员代表大会的大喜日子。她们是多么高兴啊！永光寺街道食堂的管理员陈新竹老大娘和她的在服务站当副站长的老伴，一大早就来了。五个孩子的妈妈栾耀奎戴着三枚奖章坐在主席台上。先进生产者姜淑玉、马惠平在会场前燃放起鞭炮。她们，这些多少年来围着锅台转的家庭妇女们，在短短的十七个月里，通过劳动实践，改变着自己，同时也改变着整个居民区的面貌。
    瓜熟蒂落
    这个公社是一年半前成立的。实际上，办公社的思想种子早就埋下了。那时，全民整风运动的浪潮推向街道。居民群众大鸣大放大辩论。妇女们通过对新旧社会的对比，展开了关于社会主义还是资本主义的两条道路的辩论。辩论是从买东西是否方便的问题开始的。辩论会一次比一次热烈，到快吃饭的时候了，人们还不肯散。棉花胡同二十一户居民抢着发言。王敬心老太太说：“在旧社会我一家五口，睡在地上溜光席，小屋子顶上、墙上到处是洞，冬天外面下雪，屋里也下雪，墙上挂满了冰溜子。孩子冷得直叫，没办法，只好把孩子放在大人的裤子里暖着。七个孩子有六个都这样连冻带饿病倒了，谁给看病？眼睁睁地看着孩子死掉了……。解放后，生活一天天好起来，新衣服新被褥一应俱全，女儿当了保育员，外孙孙一出世，牛奶、奶糕就没断过。不只是我们家光景好了，所有劳动人民的光景都好了。你买东西，我买东西，大家都买，买起来当然是要不方便一些，可是这和从前没钱买东西的不方便一样吗？”她刚说完，袁淑敏就接下去了：“可不是，那时候，我爱人蹬三轮，累得上气不接下气，连口饭都混不上。有一次，家里几天没揭锅了，八岁的孩子拣破烂，卖了点钱，买了张饼，舍不得吃，留给我吃，我叫孩子他爹吃，他爹叫孩子吃，孩子怎么也不肯吃，一家子看着饼放声大哭。那时候，满街都是像我们这样的人，头发乱蓬蓬的，饿得人不像人，鬼不像鬼，躺在地上等死。现在你们到我家看看，大人、小孩都不愁吃，孩子上技术专科学校了。两种制度，两种生活，一个天上，一个地下，哪一种方便？”
    这样一对比，大伙更加认清了一条真理：跟着党和毛主席，走社会主义道儿，没错！但是也提出一个问题：咱们家庭妇女，怎样走这条道儿呢？她们看见早些时候走上劳动岗位的女职工，又羡慕又着急。
    这时，总路线公布了，大跃进的号角响了，农村掀起了人民公社运动的风暴，工厂面貌一天一个样，生产成倍成倍地增长，宣武区今天新建一个钢铁厂，明天又盖一个化工厂，全区近百家工厂，厂厂喊人不够，北京一些老厂像石景山钢铁厂也来区里要人，从哪儿去找人呢？这就轮到街道上的闲散劳动力了。街道上沸腾了，今天一批妇女进了工厂，明天又一批妇女当了售货员，大伙的心也跟着飞出来了。有的妇女做梦也梦见自己当了工人。有的妇女白天在家里背着人偷偷学卖菜：白菜喽！小葱、豆芽菜！许多婆婆也对媳妇说：你出去吧！孩子由我看。有的丈夫下班以后帮助妻子照料家务，鼓励她参加生产。
    这时，街道党委传达上级党委的指示：整个街道工作都要以生产为中心。
    一个汹涌澎湃的生产浪潮掀起来了。
    劳动创造一切
    椿树胡同有九个妇女，她们是干部、木工、三轮工人的家属，她们知道可以用废硫酸和铁屑作农药原料硫酸亚铁，高兴极了。她们说，咱们想法作点农药支援支援农业建设。几个人凑了两块四毛钱，又向街坊借了两个风箱，两口破锅。三个清洁工听信，连夜赶来在空地上帮她们搭了两个炉灶。一个化工厂就这样诞生了。街道上好些人把这事看成笑话，他们说：“从古以来，谁也没见过家庭妇女办工厂！”她们不理这些岔儿。
    她们听说第三制钉厂的废硫酸用完就倒掉了，又听说第三机械厂把铁屑当废物处理，就借了个排子车，自己去拉，来回好几里路，跑的满身是汗，都不肯休息。第三天晚上，大伙正干得好好的，忽然下起瓢泼大雨，淋得全身都湿透了，没一个人到房檐下躲雨的。直到水涨到一尺深，实在没法拉风箱，才进屋。干了几天，硫酸把衣服烧得满是洞，大伙的干劲却越来越大。不认识温度表，用普通尺子比着量；不懂技术，请崇文区一个化工厂的老技师来教；不会记笔记，就死记，下课后你一句我一句一块凑。他们就这样日顶太阳，夜顶月亮，终于熬出了第一锅硫酸亚铁。
    她们去北京电解铜厂找废酸。电解铜厂的同志说，他们有废酸又有铜末很想作硫酸铜，可是腾不出手来，问化工厂能不能帮忙？她们一听，高兴得不得了，回来就动手试验。一次又一次都作不成，有人灰心了，厂子的领导说，这点困难比起红军长征过草地、走雪山，算得了什么？大家大胆去作吧，组织上支持你们，试验十次不成，就试验一百次。这样一说，大伙的劲儿又足了，没多久也就作出来了。以后，电解铜厂就同她们挂上钩，按时给原料，按时收产品。北苑化工厂知道了这个消息，也把盐酸拿来，请她们加工成盐酸提纯。兴华染料厂把制作爱耳染色的任务交给她们后，抽出七、八十位工人作化学指示剂，只半年功夫就给国家创造了七百万元的财富。
    现在人们走到化工厂，就会看到近三百工人在四个车间愉快地劳动着。车间里摆着大大小小的土球锅、土甩干机和高大的硬气锅炉、耐酸泵。如果到新产品试验室看看，还会看到重钨酸铵等十多种产品。工厂的月产值现在已经不是几千几万，而是四、五十万元了。
    许多工厂都是像化工厂这样成长起来的。像三百多人的玻璃厂就是两盏油灯起家的；五百多人的塑料厂，是由一把裁纸刀办起来的。除了这些厂子，公社最近还把成百个各种类型的生产小组合并成两个综合工厂，专门为市场上加工各种日用小工业品，妇女们在一起糊纸口袋，折书页子，装订旧书，装配口哨、平直废旧铁钉……。这些妇女，过去因为孩子多，只好把活儿领到家里去做。现在随着生产大发展，公社的底子渐渐厚了，集体福利事业越办越好，越来越多的妇女走出家门，进入了综合厂。集中生产以后，活儿干的比以前快了。像糊三角比例尺的二十多个女工，原来在生产小组时，二十五天只能糊五万多个，进综合工厂仅仅一个星期，就糊了近五万个。另外，一部分不愿离家太远的妇女，可以到附近的集中生产组生产；一些家务拖累太大的人，像家里有病人需要照顾的，也可从工厂把活儿领回家去做。现在，凡是愿意参加生产的劳动人民和职工家属，都有适当的活干。
    这个从来听不到马达声的居民区，现在挂着许多新牌子：五金工厂、仪器厂、玻璃工厂、浆糊厂。大院的门口和院心里堆放着铁皮、钢板、各种各样的原料和马上要运走的玻璃管、仪器……。
    现在，全公社已有十八个像样的工厂，有三千九百零五人参加了生产，生产的一百五十九种产品中，有多种多样的小产品，也有较精密的仪器和漂亮的塑料雨衣、手提包……。
    劳动人民的乐园
    山西街有一个大杂院，里面住着四十来户人家。1958年8月中，那里办了一个小缝纫厂，有六十多位妇女作活。大伙参加了生产，干劲满高，可是吃饭问题没解决，很多人天不亮就起来生火做饭，吃完饭锅也不刷就赶去上班，有时还迟到。她们每天在工厂忙了一天，回家还得围着锅台转。
    二十多名街道妇女积极分子在一块商量：“大杂院里有一间破房子，多少年没人住，满屋子蜘蛛网，尘土有手指厚，房里堆满了破砖烂瓦，怎么不利用一下呢？”她们说完就动手，有的搬砖，有的抬土，有的合泥，何启信的丈夫也赶来帮助砌炉灶。他们边干边唱，整整闹了一夜，比赶庙会还热闹。第二天知道办食堂的人多了，你送一把刀，我送几块钱，不一会儿锅碗瓢盆、桌椅板凳都送来了。街道医院的医生还给炊事员送来一件白大褂作罩衣。食堂开伙了。不过两天，全公社二十多条街巷，紧跟着出现了二十多个食堂。
    吃饭有着落了，大伙很高兴，可是心里还有块疙瘩：大人上班，孩子在家没人管。她们利用门道、庭院和自己多余的房子，办起了最初的托儿所。原先三天两日进医院的“小药罐”进了山西街幼儿园以后，一天比一天胖，妈妈高兴地马上把两个大孩子也都送进幼儿园。山西街哺乳室开办时收了三十多个娃娃，入所一个多月，娃娃们的体重平均增加了一公斤。家长们都说：咱劳动人民的孩子，住托儿所比在家还享福。
    劳动人民祖祖辈辈所梦想的理想生活在这里开始实现了：清晨，熟悉旧北京的人，走过这个居民区，马上就会感到空气比过去清新。许多人家早晨起来不再自己做饭，扑鼻的炊烟少多了。在工厂集中的山西街、后孙公园、海北寺街，有三个能容纳上千人吃饭的机械化、半机械化大食堂，在公社境内，它们的位置像个“品”字，许多中小型食堂星罗棋布在它们的四周，各个工厂附近都有食堂，职工一下班，走不多远就可以吃到饭。在这些食堂入伙的和在托儿所、幼儿园吃饭的儿童，总共有五千一百多人，绝大部分是生产人员和他们的家属。每当开饭的时候，大食堂的炊事员骑着三轮车，把热腾腾的馒头送到附近的中小食堂去。几个大食堂里，有集体餐厅，也有“母子餐厅”、“回民餐厅”和“客饭厅”，有些食堂为入伙的病人、老人、幼儿专做软食，还根据传统习惯，为生产人员加工节日菜饭。假日、星期天，一家老小来食堂吃“团圆饭”的越来越多。大食堂附近有淋浴室、蒸馏间和洗衣房，综合利用大食堂蒸汽大锅炉的废汽、废水。晚饭过后，食堂又变成了课堂、会场和俱乐部，人们在这里讨论跃进规划、学文化、看书、打乒乓球，扩音器传出职工合唱团欢腾的歌声：“人民公社，好比太阳，万道金光，照耀四方，要把人间变天堂”……。晚上，妈妈把孩子从托儿所接回家里的时候，街道服务员们早已把房间打扫得干干净净，暖水瓶里也灌满了水。很多职工把家里的钥匙交给服务员，说他们是“管家人”。
    劳动最光荣
    “劳动光荣，不劳动可耻”，成为这里的新风尚了。白天，很多人家都锁上了门，很少看见提着菜篮、酱油罐的妇女。许多居民大院里只剩下一两个老人在看门，只有一早一晚和星期天，街道上才能看见一群群拿着提包、有说有笑的女工。邻里间传播的不再是张家长、李家短，而是谁家姑娘当了红旗手，哪家姊妹出席了群英会。大家一见面，不再像过去那样问：“你吃啦没有？”而是常常互相打听：“你今天完成了多少产品？”先进生产者姜淑玉含着喜悦的泪花比方着说：过去我爱人下班，一进屋门就嚷：“屋里的哪儿去了？”现在呢，他这样说：“咱那上班的回来没有？”
    栾耀奎从一个典型的家庭妇女到一个共产党员，是这个居民区许多妇女已经走过和正在走着的道路。
    两年以前，栾耀奎还是一个“大门不出，二门不迈”的家庭妇女。每天一睁眼，就忙着给丈夫和五个孩子做饭、洗衣，经常忙得自己衣服扣不上，脸洗不了。就这样，丈夫还说：“你一天干什么，把家搞得这么乱七八糟！”她想：下辈子可别再当女人了，女人不是人！
    街道上闹生产，她进了儿童玩具厂。开始，身在厂，心在家，一面作活一面想：小四、小五今天乖不乖？下班钟点一到，她就往家跑。
    工厂上政治课，大伙回忆对比新旧社会。栾耀奎想，现在日子一好过，就成天想自己的小家庭，忘了大家庭，这还像话？如今自己已走上了建设社会主义的光荣岗位，怎能稀松松，上班心不在焉？这么一想，想家的思想甩掉了一半。手下一天比一天快，活一天比一天出的多。有一天她注意到张多兰出活少，弄得全组完不成计划，她和组长商量后，把张多兰做不完的活拿回家，晚上帮着赶。一个午夜，天上掉雨点，她想，工厂院子里堆满了锯末，一淋雨再一晒就要损失很多。她毫不犹豫地把三个孩子叫醒，跑到工厂去，收拾了两个多钟头。去年年底，栾耀奎光荣地入了党。她的丈夫也格外体贴她了。
    作一个光荣的共产党员，这是这个居民区许多妇女的心事。现在这个公社已经有八个先进的街道妇女加入了中国共产党，听党课的妇女从1958年的二十多人增加到二百多人。
    这个普通的居民区，在大跃进时代里，正经历着翻天覆地的变革！在变消费城市为生产城市这个全市的总目标上，由于人民公社的建立，和其他街道一样，它已进入一个新的里程。公社党委书记说：“许多事情还没做好，要做的事多得很，现在只不过是万里长征第一步。”
