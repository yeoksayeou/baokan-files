    Mengjin County, Henan Province, has prepared strong livestock for the summer harvest and planting. The county has planted a total of 380,000 mu of wheat, and the wheat seedlings are generally growing well and strong. This year's summer planting tasks are also very heavy, so adequate animal power is needed.
    The Mengjin County Committee of the Communist Party of China has held a training class for breeders in the Nanmatun Commune to exchange breeding experience. Communes also used their spare time to organize members to harvest green fodder, and in half a month the county had harvested 1,540,000 jin of green fodder.
    Currently, 2,800 head of livestock in the county have improved their fatness levels, and 61 brigades have eliminated third-class fatness in their livestock.

    河南孟津县为夏收夏种准备壮畜
    河南孟津县已为夏收夏种备好强壮的牲畜。这个县共种小麦三十八万亩，麦苗普遍长得好、长得壮；今年夏种任务也很繁重，因此需要充分的畜力。
    中共孟津县委已在南麻屯公社举办了饲养员训练班，交流饲养经验。各公社还利用空闲时间，组织社员收割青饲料，半个月时间全县已收割青饲料一百五十四万斤。
    现在全县有二千八百头牲畜膘肥升了级，有六十一个大队的牲畜消灭了三类膘。
