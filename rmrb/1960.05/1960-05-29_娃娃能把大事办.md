    Children Can Accomplish Great Things
    Riding satellites, piloting rockets,
    Technical innovation attacks the cutting edge, hard work plus ingenuity, determined to present gifts on "June 1st."
    Under the leadership of the Party, all teachers and students of the Ningzhai Central Primary School in Jishan County have launched a new upsurge of scientific research and technological innovation in order to present outstanding achievements to "June 1st." At present, teacher Jia Yunlong has successfully trial-produced cameras, homemade radios, electric bells, transmitters, earphones, and electric motors. Ning Shengquan has trial-produced an electric crane and led students in making a homemade film projector and seven kinds of chemical fertilizers (ammonium nitrate, potassium chloride, magnesium chloride, bittern, nitrified soil complete fertilizer, potassium nitrate, calcium nitrate), and five kinds of pesticides (lime sulfur mixture, peach liquid insecticide, alum mixture, 666, DDT). All teachers and students in the school have made Stevenson screens, rain gauges, evaporation dishes, wind vanes, anemometers, high poles, weather sentries, etc. The masses reflected:
    Primary school has a weather station, like the Beijing Agricultural College,
    Weather changes are fully grasped, children can accomplish great things.
    Our teachers and students not only actively researched and trial-produced electrified teaching tools, mechanized cooking stoves, and agricultural tools, but also carried out more than a thousand kinds of grafting experiments in the Young Pioneer Farm.

    娃娃能把大事办
    乘卫星，驾火箭，
    技术革新攻尖端，苦干实干加巧干，“六一”决心把礼献。
    我们稷山县宁翟中心小学全体师生，为了以卓越的成绩向“六一”献礼，在党的领导下，已经掀起了一个科学研究和技术革新的新高潮。目前教师加云龙试制成功了照像机、土收音机、电铃、送话机、耳机、电动机，宁盛泉试制了电动起重机，并领导学生制成了土电影机和七种化学肥料（硝酸铵、氯化钾、氯化镁、卤水、硝土全素肥、硝酸钾、硝酸钙）、五种农药（石灰硫磺合剂、桃液杀虫剂、桑矾剂、六六六、滴滴涕），全校师生动手制成了百叶箱、雨量筒、蒸发嘴、风向标、风压计、高杆、气象哨等，群众反映说：
    小学有了气象站，好像北京农学院，
    气象变化全掌握，娃娃能把大事办。
    我们全校师生不仅积极研究试制了电气化教具、机械化灶具、农具，而且在红领巾农场里，进行了千种以上的嫁接试验。
