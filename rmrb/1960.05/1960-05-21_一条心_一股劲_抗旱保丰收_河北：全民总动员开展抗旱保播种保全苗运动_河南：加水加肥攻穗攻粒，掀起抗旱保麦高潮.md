One Heart, One Mind, One Strength: Fight Drought and Secure a Bumper Harvest
	Hebei: Mobilize the Whole People to Launch a Campaign to Combat Drought, Ensure Sowing, and Protect Seedlings
	Henan: Add Water and Fertilizer to Attack the Ears and Grains, Setting Off a High Tide of Fighting Drought and Protecting Wheat

    (Report from this newspaper) The broad masses of people in Hebei Province, with one heart and one mind, have launched a vigorous mass movement to fight drought, secure a bumper harvest, ensure sowing, and protect seedlings.

    Combating drought is the most prominent and central task of the entire Party and all the people in Hebei Province. The Provincial Party Committee requires all localities to make the greatest determination, go all out, and concentrate on fighting drought, resolutely achieving "guaranteeing sowing without rain, and guaranteeing a bumper harvest without rain."

    In order to overcome the drought and win a bumper harvest, Party organizations at all levels are led by their secretaries, dispatching more cadres to go deep into the front line of the drought struggle overnight. According to statistics from three cities and fifteen counties, more than 95,000 cadres have recently been dispatched to the communes and teams to lead and participate in the drought struggle. Different combat measures have been adopted according to the different conditions in different regions. For example, in addition to making great efforts to use all five types of water sources – wells, canals, rivers, reservoirs, and pits – the Tangshan area has launched a water conservancy campaign focused on sinking mechanized wells in the arid plain areas; in the hilly areas, the masses are mobilized to carry out crash digging of springs, rush-repairing of ring-mountain canals and terraced wells, and diverting water up the mountains to irrigate the land; in areas where water sources are most difficult, the masses are organized to carry out the "thousands of pots and tens of thousands of jars, people carrying and donkeys carrying" drought-resistant planting campaign. When the Secretary of the Gaocheng County Party Committee learned that many irrigation and drainage machines were not functioning, he led technicians to the countryside to help inspect, repair, and teach techniques, increasing the utilization rate of the county's 3,400 irrigation and drainage machines from the original 60% to 90%, greatly accelerating the progress of drought-resistant wheat irrigation and sowing.

    In the face of the severe drought, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members has been boosted again and again, and their fighting spirit has become stronger and stronger. They have proposed "If there is no water in the canal, we will get it from the ground; if the well water drops, we will dig deeper springs. As long as the groundwater is not exhausted, we can fight drought and ensure increased production." Workers on the industrial and financial and trade fronts, officers and soldiers of the troops, and teachers and students of schools have been fully mobilized to vigorously support the drought struggle.

    The tenacious struggle of the entire Party and all the people in Hebei Province against the drought has achieved encouraging results. In early April, the daily progress of irrigated land was 700,000 mu. Since late April, despite the continued severe development of the drought, the daily progress of irrigated land has increased to 1.7 million mu and is now advancing towards the goal of irrigating 3 million mu per day.

    (Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou) Henan Province has set off a vigorous upsurge in fighting drought and protecting wheat. The broad masses of rural commune members have invested in the battle of watering and topdressing fertilizer, eliminating three types of seedlings, and annihilating pests and diseases, to ensure that wheat successfully passes the heading and grain-filling stage, achieving large ears, multiple grains, and plump seeds.

    At present, the drought situation in Henan is still developing. Except for the Xinyang and Nanyang prefectures, most areas do not have sufficient soil moisture. In order to combat drought and protect wheat, five communes, including Changhua, Hengshui, and Beimatun, located on the Mangshan Ridge in Mengjin County, have used 360 newly drilled mechanized wells to form a 130-li long and 38-li wide water conservancy network, irrigating 60,000 mu of land in just seven days. Yuxian County used six 100-li long canals to bypass eight ridges, allowing the historically water-deficient terraced fields to be universally irrigated with a heading and grain-filling watering.

    In the drought-fighting and wheat-protecting campaign, Party committee secretaries at all levels are sitting in command, and a large number of cadres are leaving their offices, rolling up their sleeves, and going to the fields. The Henan Provincial Party Committee recently transferred more than 1,000 cadres from various provincial departments to help the masses in various prefectures fight drought.

    While vigorously fighting drought and irrigating wheat, various localities are also carrying out a crash elimination of three types of seedlings, besieging low-yield fields, and allowing the three types of wheat to climb to a higher level before the harvest. Since late April, various localities have generally applied topdressing fertilizer to the three types of fields.

    Various localities have also carried out activities to prevent and control wheat diseases and insect pests. Wheat with wheat rust has generally undergone prevention and control, and insect pests have been basically eliminated. (Attached Picture)

    一条心　一股劲　抗旱保丰收
    河北：全民总动员开展抗旱保播种保全苗运动
    河南：加水加肥攻穗攻粒，掀起抗旱保麦高潮
    本报讯　河北省广大人民一条心，一股劲，掀起了轰轰烈烈的抗旱保丰收、保播种、保全苗的群众运动。
    抗旱是河北省当前全党全民最突出的中心任务，省委要求各地必须下最大决心，全力以赴，突击抗旱，坚决实现“无雨保播种，无雨保丰收”。
    为了战胜干旱，夺得丰收，各级党组织都由书记挂帅，增派干部，连夜深入抗旱斗争第一线。据三个市和十五个县的统计，最近已增派九万五千多名干部深入到社、队，领导和参加抗旱斗争。并根据不同地区的不同条件，采取了不同的战斗措施。如唐山地区除大搞井、渠、河、库、坑五水齐用以外，在平原干旱地区，又开展了以打机井为重点的水利运动；在丘陵地区则发动群众突击凿泉，赶修环山渠和梯子井，引水上山浇地；在水源最困难的地方，就组织群众开展千盆万罐，人担驴驮抗旱点种运动。藁城县委书记了解到很多排灌机械没有发挥作用，就带领技术工人下乡，帮助检查修理和传授技术，使全县三千四百台排灌机械活动起来，利用率由原来60％提高到90％，大大加快了抗旱浇麦和播种进度。
    在严重的干旱面前广大社员干劲一鼓再鼓，斗志越战越强，纷纷提出“渠里无水向地要，井水下降深挖泉，只要地下水不尽，就能抗旱保增产”。工业财贸战线职工和部队官兵、学校师生总动员，大力支援抗旱斗争。
    河北省全党全民向干旱的顽强搏斗，已经取得了令人振奋的成就。4月上旬浇地日进度七十万亩，从下旬以来，在干旱继续严重发展的情况下，浇地日进度却增加到一百七十万亩，现正向日浇三百万亩的目标挺进。
    据新华社郑州电　河南省掀起轰轰烈烈的抗旱保麦高潮。广大农村社员投入了浇水追肥、消灭三类苗、歼灭病虫害的战斗，保证小麦胜利渡过抽穗灌浆关，达到穗大粒多，籽粒饱满。
    目前，河南旱情还在继续发展，除信阳、南阳专区外，大部分地区墒情都不足。为了抗旱保麦，位于邙山岭上的孟津县长华、横水、北马屯等五个公社，利用新打成的三百六十眼机井，组成一百三十里长三十八里宽的水利网，仅七天时间就浇地六万亩。禹县利用六条百里长渠，绕过八条岗岭，使历来缺水的梯田，普浇了一遍灌浆水。
    在抗旱保麦运动中，各级党委书记都坐阵指挥，大批干部走出办公室卷袖下田。中共河南省委最近从省直各单位抽调一千多名干部，分赴各专区帮助群众抗旱。
    在轰轰烈烈地抗旱浇麦的同时，各地还突击消灭三类苗，围攻低产田，让三类麦在丰收前更上一层楼。4月下旬以来，各地普遍给三类田施了追肥。
    各地还开展了防治小麦病虫害活动。发生麦锈病的小麦普遍经过防治，虫害基本扑灭。（附图片）
