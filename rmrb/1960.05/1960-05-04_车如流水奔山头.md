Cars flow like water, rushing up the hill to the riverbank. It's a wharf, the road is slippery, and the slope is steep. The cliff above the slope is dangerous, and the river flows below. Pedestrians frown when they see it. Descending, we use shoulder poles; ascending, we use baskets on our backs. Sweat pours out when going up and down the slope, and the burden on our shoulders brings three parts of worry. Now, mechanization is realized. Motorized winches travel uphill. Gently press the small button, and cars flow like water, rushing up the hill. Loading a thousand tons a day is no longer a worry, and no one says the road is difficult anymore.

    车如流水奔山头下河坝，是码头，路又滑，坡又陡，坡上悬岩险，坡下江水流，行人见它皱眉头。下坡用肩挑，上坡背背兜，上坡下坡汗直流，担子上肩三分愁。如今实现机械化，机动绞车坡上游，轻轻按动小电钮，车如流水奔山头，日装千吨不用愁，无人再说路难走。——重庆水轮机厂工人
