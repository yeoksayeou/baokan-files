Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 28th: This reporter reports: In the month since the heroic South Korean people overthrew the traitor Syngman Rhee on April 26th, they have continued their unyielding struggle to dissolve the puppet National Assembly, punish the traitors Syngman Rhee and his lackeys, and completely abolish the fascist ruling system. During this period, workers went on strike, students boycotted classes, merchants boycotted markets, and farmers exposed the bloody crimes of the US-Rhee clique and fought with the puppet police. From cities to villages, from factories to schools, like an angry ocean connected into one, they fiercely attacked US imperialism and the puppet group from all directions.

The people of Busan have held large-scale demonstrations continuously for eight or nine days since May 1st. Angry masses burned and destroyed many fascist organs, plunging Busan into a state of "anarchy" for many days. They shouted: "Immediately dissolve the corrupt National Assembly!" "Don't trust the Democratic Party, immediately dissolve the Liberal Party!" "Punish the murderers!" They shouted the common aspirations of the South Korean people: "We lived in shacks during the US military government, we also lived in shacks under the rule of Syngman Rhee's Liberal Party, and we are still living in shacks. We must change this situation!"

Just as US imperialism and its lackeys were using the puppet "National Assembly" to create scams such as "amending the constitution," a demonstration broke out in Seoul again on May 25th. More than sixty citizens demonstrated in front of the puppet "National Assembly," demanding the dissolution of the puppet "National Assembly." Seoul's influential newspaper "Chosun Ilbo" also recently published an editorial calling for the puppet "National Assembly" members to resign en masse. The newspaper said that the current "National Assembly" members, who once served as appendages to the Syngman Rhee group's betrayal of the nation, "what face do they have to face the people, ...what face do they have to sit in the National Assembly hall!" "The only path for the National Assembly members is to resign en masse and confess their crimes to the people."

In this month, the South Korean working class has further strengthened its unity in the struggle, supported each other, and made persistent efforts, setting off increasingly large-scale strikes and demonstrations. After the fall of Syngman Rhee, workers in various parts of South Korea then destroyed Syngman Rhee's pro-government trade union organization—the "Federation of Korean Trade Unions." In some places, employees established their own elected trade unions. Recently, workers in major industrial cities in South Korea, such as Seoul, Busan, and Daegu, have also launched large-scale strikes. More than 3,800 taxi and bus employees in Seoul decided to begin a slowdown strike from May 28th to demand an eight-hour work system and improved working conditions. More than 370 bus employees on the Seoul-Sinchon bus line began this struggle on May 22nd and held demonstrations. Bus and taxi employees in Busan and Daegu have also recently held strikes and demonstrations to improve their treatment and abolish intermediate exploitation. In addition, all employees of Koryo Paper Company in Gunsan and more than 2,600 workers from more than 40 clothing factories in Busan, as well as transport workers in Mokpo, have successively carried out general strikes to conclude collective labor contracts, drive away labor traitors, and increase wages.

South Korean youth and students, who have always stood at the forefront of the struggle against the fascist rule of the US-Rhee group, launched a struggle during this period to expel US-Rhee special agents and pro-government elements from schools. As of May 23rd, students from a total of 230 schools in Seoul, Busan, Daegu, Gwangju, Gunsan, and other places participated in this struggle. The students condemned the principals, school supervisors, and pro-government teachers sent to the schools by the Syngman Rhee group for extorting money from students' parents and treating students as political tools and other ugly behaviors. In order to drive them out of schools, students launched various forms of struggle such as boycotts, demonstrations, collective sit-ins, refusing to attend classes, and holding condemnation meetings. The principals of many schools have been driven away by the students.

The wave of struggle in South Korean rural areas to expose the crimes of the Syngman Rhee group in massacring the people and demanding the punishment of Syngman Rhee and the big and small executioners has made the struggle to eradicate the fascist rule of the US-Rhee group more in-depth and widespread. After the farmers of Sinwon-myeon, Geochang-gun, Gyeongsangnam-do, personally executed Park Young-bo, the accomplice who manufactured the "Geochang Massacre" in which 600 innocent people were slaughtered, on the evening of May 11th, farmers in Hamyang-gun, Sancheong-gun, Yangsan-gun, Hadong-gun, Chungmu-si of Gyeongsangnam-do and Daseong-gun of Gyeongsangbuk-do, Jangheung-gun of Jeollanam-do, successively exposed many cases of massacres of innocent people committed by the Syngman Rhee group. The people and families of the deceased in these places held accusation meetings and other activities, resolutely demanding the punishment of the murderers and avenging the deceased.

The struggle in the countryside to demand the punishment of murderers has won the support of the broad masses of the people. In Seoul, students from Geochang-gun, Gyeongsangnam-do, where the "Geochang Massacre" had occurred, angrily took to the streets of Seoul to demonstrate. When they arrived in front of the office of Heo Jeong, the new puppet president of South Korea, the students shouted: "Immediately arrest and punish the criminals!" "We want to watch the attitude of the caretaker cabinet!" and other slogans.

The awareness of South Korean farmers is increasing day by day in the struggle. They bravely stood up to drive away the special agents who colluded with the US-Rhee group, demanded that the puppet authorities return the occupied land, resisted the payment of exorbitant taxes, and expelled the puppet local government. For example, on May 23rd, 1,500 farmers in Buhang-myeon, Gimryeong-gun, Gyeongsangbuk-do, bravely fought with the puppet police, seized the police's machine guns and carbines, expelled the puppet myeon office (i.e., district government), and burned down the puppet myeon office building.

Encouraged by the rising fighting spirit of workers, farmers, and students, South Korean small merchants also stood up to hold demonstrations and collective market boycotts. This is a new force in the South Korean people's struggle against fascist rule in the past month. Small merchants in Busan, Daegu, and other places have held several market boycotts and demonstrations to oppose the puppet authorities' collection of exorbitant taxes. On May 19th, more than 500 merchants from Busan International Market also broke into the offices of the puppet "Director of the Tax Bureau" and the puppet "Director of the East Busan Tax Office," shouting slogans such as "Reduce the tax amount by half!" "Fair burden of taxes!" "Tax collectors are not allowed to engage in corruption and coercion of merchants!"

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 28th: Workers, students, and merchants in various parts of South Korea continue to launch fierce struggles against fascist rule and the cruel system of exploitation.

According to Daegu Radio, on the 27th, 1,400 laid-off workers in Daegu held a demonstration demanding to be reinstated.

These male and female textile workers, who were laid off by the Daegu factory of "Daehan Textile Company," gathered in front of the company's gate on this day, chanting slogans and carrying out the struggle. They condemned the unreasonable measures of the capitalists in laying off workers, strongly demanded the immediate reinstatement of all laid-off workers, and demanded that the work of 131 male workers and 78 female workers who were starving to death due to being laid off be restored first. In order to implement their demands, they broke into the company's office to carry out the struggle. The puppet authorities hurriedly sent military police to suppress the workers and fired tear gas.

According to Jeonju Radio, students from Iri Industrial High School in Jeollabuk-do have been boycotting classes since May 20th to drive out the principal who colluded with the Syngman Rhee group, and they are still continuing the boycott. According to reports, the students of this school held a demonstration on May 3rd demanding the immediate dissolution of the puppet "National Assembly." Later, in order to fight for freedom and democracy, they strongly demanded that the principal resign immediately. This principal, who had colluded with the Syngman Rhee group in the past, continues to collude with the new puppet authorities and has been refusing the students' demands.

According to another report, a struggle against taxation by merchants broke out in Daegu on May 20th. On this day, more than 60 female fabric merchants from Seomun Market in Daegu rushed into the office of the puppet "Mayor" of Daegu, strongly protesting the puppet authorities' behavior of forcibly collecting exorbitant taxes.

    李承晚垮台后的一个多月来
    南朝鲜人民继续冲击美国及其走狗的统治
    工人罢工农民示威学生罢课商人罢市形成愤怒的海洋
    新华社平壤28日电　本社记者报道：英勇的南朝鲜人民在4月26日把卖国贼李承晚赶下台以后，近一个月来，继续为解散伪国会、惩办卖国贼李承晚和他的走狗、全面废除法西斯统治制度展开不屈不挠的斗争。在这一期间，工人罢工，学生罢课，商人罢市，农民揭露美李集团的血腥罪行并同伪警察展开搏斗。从城市到农村，从工厂到学校，如同连成一片的愤怒的海洋，四面八方向美帝国主义和傀儡集团猛烈地冲击。
    釜山人民从5月1日起连续举行了八、九天规模巨大的示威斗争，愤怒的群众焚烧和捣毁了许多法西斯机关，使釜山好多天陷入“无政府状态”。他们高呼：“立即解散腐败的国会！”“不要相信民主党，立即解散自由党！”“惩办杀人的凶手！”他们喊出了南朝鲜人民共同的心声：“在美国军政府时期我们住板棚，在李承晚自由党的统治下我们也是住板棚，现在还是住板棚，一定要改变这种状况！”
    就在美帝国主义和他的走狗利用伪“国会”制造“修改宪法”等骗局的时候，汉城5月25日又爆发了示威斗争。六十多名市民在伪“国会”门前示威，要求解散伪“国会”。汉城有影响的大报“朝鲜日报”最近也发表社论，要伪“国会”议员总辞职。这家报纸说，曾经充当李承晚集团背叛民族行为的附属品的现“国会”议员，“有什么面目面对着国民，……有什么面目坐在国会议事堂内！”“国会议员们只有立即总辞职、向国民认罪这条路可走。”
    在这一个多月里，南朝鲜工人阶级在斗争中进一步加强了团结，相互支持，再接再厉，掀起了规模越来越大的罢工和示威斗争。在李承晚倒台以后，南朝鲜各地的工人接着摧毁了李承晚的御用工会组织——“大韩劳动组合联合会”，有的地方的职工建立了自己选出来的工会。近来，汉城、釜山、大丘等南朝鲜主要工业城市的工人还掀起了大规模的罢工斗争。汉城市三千八百多名出租汽车和公共汽车职工为要求实现八小时劳动制、改善劳动条件决定从5月28日开始进行怠工斗争。汉城—新村公共汽车线路上的三百七十多名公共汽车职工从5月22日就开始了这种斗争，并举行了示威。釜山和大丘的公共汽车和出租汽车的职工也在最近为改善待遇和废除中间剥削举行罢工和示威。此外，群山的高丽制纸公司的全体职工和釜山的四十多个被服厂的二千六百多名工人以及木浦的运输工人也先后为订立集体劳动合同、赶走工贼和提高工资进行了总罢工。
    在反对美李集团法西斯统治的斗争中一直站在斗争前列的南朝鲜青年学生，这一时期展开了驱逐美李特务和御用分子出校的斗争。截至5月23日，汉城、釜山、大丘、光州、群山等各地共有二百三十个学校的学生参加了这一斗争。学生们谴责李承晚集团派到学校的校长、校监和御用教员搜刮学生家长的血汗钱、把学生当作政治工具等丑恶行为。为了把他们赶出学校，学生们展开了罢课、示威、集体静坐、拒绝听课、召开声讨大会等各种形式的斗争。有许多学校的校长已经被学生们赶走。
    南朝鲜农村掀起的揭露李承晚集团屠杀人民的罪行，要求惩办李承晚和大小刽子手的斗争浪潮，使要求铲除美李集团法西斯统治的斗争更加深入而广泛了。在庆尚南道居昌郡神院面的农民5月11日晚亲手处死了制造屠杀六百名无辜人民的“居昌大惨案”的帮凶、伪面长朴英甫以后，庆尚南道的咸阳郡、山清郡、梁山郡、河东郡、忠武市和庆尚北道的达成郡、全罗南道的长兴郡等地的农民，又一件接一件地揭发了多起李承晚集团制造的集体屠杀无辜人民的大惨案。这些地方的人民和死者的家属纷纷举行控诉集会等活动，坚决要求惩办杀人凶手，为死者报仇。
    农村要求惩办杀人凶手的斗争，得到了广大人民的支持。在汉城，故乡曾发生“居昌大惨案”的庆尚南道居昌郡的学生，愤怒地走上汉城的大街示威，在到达南朝鲜新傀儡总统许政的办公厅门前时，学生们高呼：“立即逮捕和惩办凶犯！”“我们要注视看守内阁的态度！”等口号。
    南朝鲜农民在斗争中觉悟日益提高。他们勇敢地站起来赶走同美李集团勾结的特务分子，要求伪当局退还被霸占的土地，抗缴苛捐杂税，并且驱逐伪地方政府。如5月23日，庆尚北道金陵郡釜项面的一千五百名农民英勇地同伪警察展开搏斗，夺取了警察的机关枪和卡宾枪，驱逐了伪面事务所（即区政府），并焚毁了伪面事务所的房子。
    南朝鲜的小商人在工人、农民和学生高涨的斗争情绪的鼓舞下，也站起来举行示威和集体罢市斗争。这是这一月来南朝鲜人民反对法西斯统治的斗争中一股新的力量。釜山、大丘等地的小商人已数次举行罢市和示威，反对伪当局征收苛捐杂税。5月19日，釜山国际市场五百多名商人还冲进了伪“税务厅长”的办公室和东釜山伪“税务署署长”办公室，高呼“把税额降低一半！”“捐税公平负担！”“不许收税员舞弊和威迫商人！”等口号。
    据新华社平壤28日电　南朝鲜各地的工人、学生、商人继续激烈地展开反对法西斯统治、反对残酷的剥削制度的斗争。
    据大丘广播电台广播，27日，大丘一千四百名被解雇的工人举行示威，要求恢复工作。
    这些被“大韩纺织会社”大丘工厂解雇的男女纺织工人，这一天聚集在会社的大门前，高呼口号进行斗争。他们谴责资方解雇工人的无理措施，强硬要求立即恢复被解雇的全体工人的工作，并且要求首先恢复因为被解雇而快要饿死的一百三十一名男工和七十八名女工的工作。他们为了贯彻自己的要求，冲进会社的办公室进行斗争。傀儡当局慌忙派宪兵来镇压工人，并放射了催泪弹。
    据全州广播电台广播，全罗北道里里市工业高等学校的学生为了驱逐同李承晚集团勾结的校长出校，从5月20日开始罢课，直到现在还进行着罢课斗争。据报道，这个学校的学生在5月3日曾举行示威，要求立即解散伪“国会”，后来他们为了争取自由民主，强硬要求校长立即辞职。这个过去同李承晚集团勾结的校长现在继续同新的傀儡当局勾结，一直拒绝学生们的要求。
    另据报道，大丘市在5月20日曾爆发了商人抗税的斗争。这一天，大丘市西门市场六十多名贩卖布匹的女商贩冲进大丘市伪“市长”办公室，强硬抗议傀儡当局强征苛捐杂税的行为。
