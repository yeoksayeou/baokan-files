Strengthening a Visit of Friendship and Unity

　　Our Premier Zhou Enlai, at the invitation of Prince Sihanouk and the Royal Government of Cambodia, visited our friendly neighbor, the Kingdom of Cambodia. Premier Zhou Enlai received a grand reception and warm welcome from the Royal Government and people of Cambodia. During these days, the entire city of Phnom Penh expressed the profound affection of the Cambodian people for the Chinese people through jubilant celebrations for Premier Zhou Enlai; the Chinese people also extended cordial greetings and wishes to the Cambodian people through Premier Zhou Enlai. During the visit, Premier Zhou Enlai held sincere and friendly talks with Cambodian Prince Sihanouk and Prime Minister Pho Proeung and issued a joint statement on the talks. This statement fully demonstrates that Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Cambodia has further enhanced the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Cambodia.

　　The joint statement of the leaders of China and Cambodia, after satisfactorily reviewing the very satisfactory achievements made by China and Cambodia in economic and cultural cooperation since 1956, pointed out that "the two governments have decided to further develop their cooperation in all aspects." This is entirely in line with the wishes and interests of the people of both countries. The people of China and Cambodia, as well as all Asian countries that have achieved independence, are willing to strengthen cooperation with each other in a peaceful international environment, on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, exchanging goods and providing mutual assistance in the economy, and exchanging and learning from each other in culture, in order to rapidly change the backward state of economy and culture. As Premier Zhou Enlai said at the state banquet of the Royal Government of Cambodia: "The common desire of the people of Asian countries is to strengthen unity and cooperation and strive for a peaceful international environment in order to build their own countries as soon as possible." Today, 650 million Chinese people are working hard to build their motherland. The Chinese people sincerely hope that all Asian countries that have suffered from imperialism and colonialism in the past will also be able to achieve rapid independent development in the economic and cultural fields after embarking on the road of independent development. Because only by establishing an independent economy can political independence be consolidated and developed; only in this way can Asian countries effectively strengthen their national strength, jointly resist imperialist aggression, and safeguard peace in Asia. Therefore, the Chinese people warmly congratulate the Cambodian people on the achievements they have made in developing their national economy and cultural undertakings in the past few years. Prince Sihanouk said that the Cambodian people are doing their best to "ensure accelerated progress towards the stage of ending our underdevelopment." He also said: "Our salvation can only rely on ourselves." We fully agree with the policy of the leaders of the Kingdom of Cambodia to develop their country's independent economy independently. We believe that as long as the people of Asia are determined and rely on their own hardworking hands, they will be able to build their own countries step by step. What Western countries can do, the people of Asian countries will certainly be able to do.

　　The joint statement of the leaders of China and Cambodia reaffirms: "The maintenance of peace lies in unreservedly respecting the agreements that have been signed, sincerely implementing the Five Principles by large and small countries, and resolving international disputes by peaceful means. Both sides condemn any attempt to use force to occupy the territory of neighboring countries." The Chinese government and people have consistently made unremitting efforts to uphold and promote the Five Principles and to promote peace in Asia and the world. The policy of peace and neutrality pursued by the Royal Government of Cambodia has also consistently been respected and praised by China and other peace-loving countries and peoples. At a time when imperialism and the reactionaries of some Asian countries are trying to undermine the unity of Asian countries and undermine the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, the joint efforts of China and Cambodia to safeguard the Five Principles are of great significance for further strengthening the unity of Asian countries.

　　The Chinese people have always advocated that all countries in the world, regardless of size, should be treated equally. This is the essence of the Five Principles. Without the principle of equality and mutual benefit, the Five Principles will be fundamentally harmed and undermined. The joint statement is completely correct in pointing out that "the principle that all countries, large and small, are completely equal in international relations should be strictly observed." Especially for our Asian countries, as long as we adhere to the principles of equality and mutual benefit, mutual understanding and mutual concession, all the differences that exist between us can be resolved through peaceful consultation. Recently, China signed a treaty of friendship and non-aggression with Myanmar and successfully resolved the complex border issues left over by history; China signed a treaty of peace and friendship with Nepal and successfully resolved the border issues between the two countries. The talks and joint statement between the leaders of China and Cambodia have provided a new example in this regard.

　　The foundation of Asian-African solidarity also lies in the mutual concern and mutual support of the people of Asian and African countries in the struggle against imperialism, for the maintenance and striving for national independence and the defense of peace. At present, the national democratic movements in Asia, Africa and Latin America are developing vigorously, especially the storm of the struggle of the oppressed people in many Asian countries against imperialism and its running dogs is rising sharply. As the great leader of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong, said: The just struggles of the people of all countries in the world support each other. The leaders of China and Cambodia clearly pointed out in the joint statement that "both sides firmly support the just cause of the Asian and African peoples against colonialism and racial discrimination and for the struggle for and the maintenance of national independence." This loud voice not only represents the common will of the people of China and Cambodia, but also reflects the common will of the people of Asia, Africa and the whole world who love peace and justice.

　　The Chinese people are very pleased to know that Prince Sihanouk and Cambodian Prime Minister Pho Proeung have happily accepted Premier Zhou Enlai's invitation to pay a friendly visit to our country in the future. We firmly believe that the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Cambodia will continue to develop under the light of the Five Principles. The traditional friendship between the people of China and Cambodia will flow forever like a mighty river.

### 加强友好和团结的访问

    加强友好和团结的访问
    我国周恩来总理，应西哈努克亲王和柬埔寨王国政府的邀请，访问了我们友好的邻邦柬埔寨王国。周恩来总理受到了柬埔寨王国政府和人民的隆重的接待和热烈的欢迎。这些天里，整个金边以倾城的欢腾，向周恩来总理表达了柬埔寨人民对中国人民的深厚感情；中国人民也通过周恩来总理向柬埔寨人民致以亲切的问候和祝愿。在访问期间，周恩来总理和柬埔寨西哈努克亲王、福·波伦首相进行了真诚友好的会谈，并发表了会谈的联合声明。这个声明充分地表明，周恩来总理这次对柬埔寨的访问进一步增进了中柬两国的友好合作关系。
    中柬两国领导人会谈的联合声明在满意地回顾了1956年以来中柬两国在经济和文化合作方面取得的十分令人满意的成就之后，指出，“两国政府决定进一步在各个方面发展他们的合作。”这是完全符合于两国人民的愿望和利益的。中国和柬埔寨，以及所有已经取得了独立的亚洲国家的人民，都愿望在一个和平的国际环境中，在平等互利的基础上，加强彼此的合作，在经济上互通有无，互相援助，在文化上相互交流和学习，以迅速改变经济和文化的落后状态。正如周恩来总理在柬埔寨王国政府的国宴上所说：“亚洲各国人民的共同愿望是加强团结合作，争取一个和平的国际环境，以便尽快地把自己的国家建设起来”。今天，六亿五千万中国人民正在为建设自己的祖国而努力。中国人民衷心地希望亚洲一切过去遭受帝国主义和殖民主义压迫的国家在走上独立发展的道路之后，也能够在经济和文化上得到迅速的独立发展。因为只有建立起独立的经济，才能巩固和发展政治上的独立；也只有这样，才能使亚洲国家有效地加强自己的国力，共同抵御帝国主义的侵略，维护亚洲的和平。因此，中国人民热烈地祝贺柬埔寨人民过去几年中在发展民族经济和文化事业中所取得的成就。西哈努克亲王说，柬埔寨人民正在竭尽全力“确保向着结束我们的不发达状态这样一个阶段加速前进”。又说：“我们的得救只能靠我们自己”。我们完全赞同柬埔寨王国领导人的这种自力更生地发展自己国家独立经济的方针。我们认为，亚洲人民只要有决心，依靠自己的勤劳的双手，一定能够一步一步地把自己的国家建设起来，西方国家能够做到的事，亚洲各国人民也一定能够做到。
    中柬两国领导人会谈的联合声明重申：“和平的维护在于无保留地尊重已经签订了的协议，大小国家真诚地执行五项原则和用和平方法解决国际争端。双方谴责任何用武力来侵占邻国领土的企图。”中国政府和人民一贯为维护和发扬五项原则，为亚洲和全世界的和平而进行不懈的努力。柬埔寨王国政府所奉行的和平中立政策，也一贯得到中国和其他爱好和平的国家和人民的尊重和赞扬。在目前正当帝国主义和一些亚洲国家的反动派，在力图破坏亚洲国家的团结，破坏和平共处五项原则的时候，中柬两国共同维护五项原则的努力，对于进一步加强亚洲国家的团结，是有重要意义的。
    中国人民一向主张，世界各国无论大小，应一律平等相待，这就是五项原则的精髓所在。缺少了平等互利的原则，也就从根本上损害和破坏五项原则。联合声明完全正确地指出，“在国际关系中，大小国家一律完全平等的原则应该得到严格的遵守。”尤其是我们亚洲国家，只要我们以平等互利为原则，互谅互让，存在于我们之间的一切分歧都是可以通过和平协商得到解决的。最近，中国同缅甸签订了友好和互不侵犯条约，顺利地解决了历史遗留下来的复杂的边界问题；中国同尼泊尔签订了和平友好条约，顺利地解决了两国之间的边界问题，就是很好的例证。中柬两国领导人的会谈和联合声明又在这方面提供了新的范例。
    亚非团结的基础，还在于亚非各国人民在反对帝国主义、维护和争取民族独立与保卫和平斗争中的相互关怀和相互支持。目前亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族民主运动正在汹涌澎湃地发展着，特别是亚洲许多国家的受压迫人民反对帝国主义及其走狗的斗争风暴正在剧烈地兴起。正如中国人民伟大的领袖毛泽东同志所说：全世界各国人民的正义斗争，都是互相支持的。中柬两国领导人在联合声明中明确地指出，“双方坚决支持亚非人民反对殖民主义和种族歧视、争取和维护民族独立的正义事业”。这个响亮的声音，不仅代表着中柬两国人民的共同意志，而且也反映了亚洲、非洲以及全世界爱好和平与正义的人民的共同意志。
    中国人民非常高兴地知道，西哈努克亲王和柬埔寨王国政府福·波伦首相已经愉快地接受了周恩来总理的邀请，将来我国进行友好访问。我们深信，中柬两国的友好合作关系将在五项原则的光芒照耀下，不断地得到新的发展。中柬两国人民的传统友谊，将如滔滔江河，永流不息。
