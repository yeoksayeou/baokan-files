Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 16th: The Central Executive Committee of the Japanese Socialist Party today officially decided to oppose the Kishi Nobusuke government and the ruling party's extension of the Diet session to forcibly push the Diet to approve the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

The Socialist Party pointed out that the Kishi Nobusuke government and the ruling party's unilateral extension of the session clearly violates the principles of the Diet. The Socialist Party believes that when important bills are not passed during the Diet session, the government should either resign immediately or dissolve the House of Representatives to seek the opinion of the people.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 16th: Three representatives of the Japanese Communist Party, including Councilor Masao Iwama, visited Speaker of the House of Representatives, Ichiro Kiyose, today to express the Japanese Communist Party's firm opposition to the Diet's approval of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

This action was taken in accordance with the resolution of the JCP's rally held yesterday against the Diet's approval of the new "Security Treaty."

Iwama Masao told the Speaker of the House of Representatives that the Communist Party demands the dissolution of the Diet, opposes the extension of the Diet session, and condemns the Liberal Democratic Party leaders' attempt to use police force to forcibly pass the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" around the 20th.

The Communist Party representatives then submitted protest letters to the U.S. Embassy in Japan and the Kishi Nobusuke government, expressing their opposition to their violation of the people's will and their conspiracy to forcibly pass this Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 17th: Two thousand workers from private enterprises in Japan went to the Diet today to submit petitions against the ratification of the new "Security Treaty" and demanding the dissolution of the House of Representatives and the resignation en masse of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet.

The vast majority of them were workers in the metal, printing, transportation, and chemical industries. The petitioners held a rally in the open space behind the Diet Building and held a demonstration in the city.

Communist Party member of the House of Representatives Yoshio Shiga and Socialist Party member of the House of Representatives Daiji Ioka spoke at the meeting. They said, regarding the public opinion hearings on the new "Security Treaty," that the testimonies of the witnesses opposing the new treaty were much more persuasive than the testimonies of the witnesses supporting it.

Ioka Daiji said that all members of the Socialist Party "will start wearing white roses on their chests from today." He said that the white rose is a symbol of peace and opposition to the new "Security Treaty." At this time, the participants applauded, expressing their welcome.

Ioka Daiji said, "The Socialist Party firmly believes that the government should be held responsible for allowing black jets to take off from U.S. bases in Japan."

At the same time, about 100 representatives from Gunma Prefecture arrived in Tokyo in two buses to submit petitions to the Diet opposing the new "Security Treaty."

The National Town Assembly of Tokyo passed a resolution yesterday expressing opposition to the ratification of the new "Security Treaty" and supporting the proposition of complete disarmament. National Town is a town with more than 31,000 residents close to the U.S. Tachikawa base. Democratic forces are quite strong in this town.

One hundred and forty-one professors from the Faculty of Engineering of Osaka City University jointly issued a statement today saying, "The new Security Treaty carries the danger of exacerbating international tensions and hindering the development of our country's academia and education. Therefore, we express our opposition." The professors also decided to send representatives to Tokyo within two or three days to submit this statement to various political parties.

The "Kyoto Cultural Forum," composed of twenty-three groups including scholars, lawyers, and people involved in the theatrical world in Kyoto, decided to distribute leaflets to citizens in front of the Kyoto station tomorrow afternoon to oppose the new "Security Treaty" and call on citizens to sign petitions.

In Morioka City, Iwate Prefecture, about 1,500 people held a rally on the 14th to express their opposition to the ratification of the treaty and demand the realization of complete and thorough disarmament. The conference unanimously passed a resolution severely condemning the United States for conducting espionage activities against the Soviet Union with U-2 aircraft, and demanding that the United States immediately stop flying over socialist countries to collect intelligence.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 16th: About thirty legal scholars' representatives attended an emergency meeting of the Legal Scholars' Conference to Prevent the Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" today. After the meeting, they went to the Diet to submit a petition signed by 400 lawyers from all over Japan demanding the dissolution of the Diet.

The petition submitted to the Diet today stated, "Certain leaders of the Liberal Democratic Party and the government are trying their best to pass the revised Security Treaty in the Diet, and even threaten to vote on this treaty independently." The petition said, "This is tantamount to destroying the principles of parliamentary politics and damaging the dignity of the Diet. We cannot expect the current Diet to conduct the sincere and satisfactory review that this treaty requires."

The emergency meeting also adopted the policy direction of the Legal Scholars' Conference to Prevent the Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." The policy stipulates that this legal scholar organization should invite more legal scholars to participate in the movement against the "Security Treaty," and step up efforts to make public opinion clear that the mass actions against the "Security Treaty" are legal. The policy also stipulates that efforts should be made to promote the further development of the trend within the ruling party against the "Security Treaty" by passing lawyers within the Liberal Democratic Party who oppose the "Security Treaty."

    日本社会党反对延长国会会期
    各地公众不断涌向国会请愿　法学家要求解散国会
    新华社16日讯　东京消息：日本社会党中央执行委员会今天正式决定了反对岸信介政府和执政党延长国会会期来强使国会批准新日美
  “安全条约”。
    社会党指出，岸信介政府和执政党单方面延长会期，显然是违反国会原则的。社会党认为，在国会会议期间，重要案件没有获得通过时，政府或者立刻辞职，或者解散众议院，征询国民的意见。
    新华社16日讯　东京消息：日本共产党的三位代表，其中包括参议院议员岩间正男今天访问众议院议长清濑一郎，向他表示了日本共产党坚决反对国会批准新日美“安全条约”的立场。
    这个行动是执行日共昨天召开的反对国会批准新“安全条约”大会的决议。
    岩间正男告诉众议院议长说，共产党要求解散国会，反对延长国会会期，并且谴责自由民主党的首脑们企图用警察的暴力在20日前后强使国会通过新日美“安全条约”。
    共产党的代表们随后向美国驻日本大使馆和岸信介政府提交了抗议书，表示反对它们违反人民的意志，阴谋强使国会通过这个日美军事同盟条约。
    据新华社17日讯　东京消息：日本两千名私营企业的工人今天前往国会递交请愿书，反对批准新“安全条约”，要求解散众议院和岸信介内阁总辞职。
    他们绝大多数是金属、印刷、运输和化学工业的工人。请愿者在国会大厦后面的空地上举行了集会，并且在市内举行了示威游行。
    共产党众议员志贺义雄、社会党众议员井冈大治在会上讲话，他们谈到关于新“安全条约”的公众意见听取会时说，反对新条约的作证人的证词比赞成这个条约的作证人的证词要有说服力得多。
    井冈大治说，社会党的全体议员“都从今天开始在胸前佩戴白玫瑰花”。他说，白玫瑰花是和平和反对新“安全条约”的象征。这时与会者鼓掌，表示欢迎。
    井冈大治说，“社会党坚决认为政府应对准许黑色喷气机从日本的美国基地上起飞负责。”
    与此同时，群马县约一百名代表乘两辆公共汽车来到东京，向国会递交了反对新“安全条约”的请愿书。
    东京都的国立町町议会昨天通过一项决议，表示反对批准新“安全条约”和支持全面裁军的主张。国立町是靠近美军立川基地的一个拥有三万一千多居民的镇。在这个町里民主力量相当强大。
    大阪市立大学工学院的一百四十一位教授今天联合发表了一项声明说，“新安全条约有这样的危险：即加剧国际紧张局势，妨碍我国学术、教育的发展。因此，表示反对。”教授们还决定，在两三天内派遣代表前往东京，把这分声明递交各政党。
    京都的学者、律师、戏剧界有关人士等二十三个团体组成的“京都文化恳谈会”，决定明天下午在京都的车站前面向市民散发反对新“安全条约”的传单，呼吁市民在请愿书上签名。
    在岩手县盛冈市，大约一千五百人14日举行集会，表示反对批准这个条约，并且要求实现全面彻底的裁军。大会一致通过决议，严厉谴责美国用U—2型飞机对苏联进行间谍活动，并要求美国立即停止在社会主义国家上空进行收集谍报的飞行。
    新华社16日讯　东京消息：大约三十名法学家代表今天出席了阻止修改日美“安全条约”法律学家会议的紧急会议。会后，他们前往国会递交了由日本各地四百位律师所签名的要求解散国会的请愿书。
    今天递交国会的请愿书说，“自由民主党和政府一部分领导人竭力想在国会中通过修改后的安全条约，甚至扬言要单独地就这项条约进行表决。”请愿书说，“这等于破坏议会政治的原则和损害国会的尊严。我们不能期望现在的国会对这项条约进行所需要的那种真诚的和令人满意的审查。”
    紧急会议还通过了阻止修改日美“安全条约”法律家会议的政策方针。方针规定这个法律家组织应该邀请更多的法律学家参加反对“安全条约”的运动，加紧努力使舆论明了反对“安全条约”的群众行动是合法的。方针还规定要努力通过在自由民主党内的反对“安全条约”的法律学家，来促进执政党内部反对“安全条约”的趋势进一步发展。
