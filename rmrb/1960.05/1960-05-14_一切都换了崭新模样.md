Spring City New Song

　　Everything has taken on a brand new look
　　Still the familiar streets,
　　Still the accustomed buildings,
　　Still the eyes filled with prosperity and the ears filled with songs,
　　Ah, but everything has taken on a brand new look!
　　The spring breeze knocks open thousands of doors,
　　Knocks open thousands of hearts ablaze with passion.
　　People's communes are like ten thousand blooming flowers,
　　The whole city surges with waves of jubilation.
　　Mothers have put on brand new work clothes,
　　Thousands of little hands clap and wave with the aunties.
　　Bearing the unique joy after labor,
　　How many people joyfully stride into the commune's dining hall.
　　Red waves wash over the streets,
　　Thoroughly cleansing the ancient customs and scenery.
　　Under the guidance of the Party, thousands of people diligently and skillfully wave their hands,
　　Weaving the whole of life into a golden net.
　　The city is brightly lit, instantly dozens of times taller and grander,
　　The hearts of the people are so brightly lit that even ten thousand miles of clear sky cannot compare.
　　Through the laughter and joyous voices permeating the entire city, ah,
　　I see the seedlings of communism thriving in the sunlight!

    一切都换了崭新模样依然是踩熟了的街道，依然是看惯了的楼房，依然是满眼繁华满耳歌呵，但，一切都换了崭新模样！春风叩开了万千座门扉，叩开了万千火热的心房。人民公社似繁花万朵，全市汹涌着欢腾的热浪。母亲们穿上了崭新的工装，千百双小手随阿姨拍舞挥扬。带着劳动后特有的满心喜悦，多少人欢笑着迈进公社食堂。红色的波浪冲刷着街道，彻底滌荡着古旧的习俗风光。在党的指点下千万人勤挥巧手，将整个生活编织成一幅金网。城市敞亮得霎时高大几十倍，人心敞亮得万里晴空也比不上。透过弥漫全城的欢声笑语呵，我看见共产主义幼芽在阳光下茁长！
