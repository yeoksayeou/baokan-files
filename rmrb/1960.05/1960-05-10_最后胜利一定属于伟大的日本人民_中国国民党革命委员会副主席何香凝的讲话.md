    We express our boundless anger and resolute opposition to the heinous acts of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries colluding with each other, actively reviving Japanese militarism, and preparing for new wars of aggression. We fully support the Japanese people's just struggle against the U.S.-Japan military treaty, against U.S. imperialism, and to overthrow the traitorous Kishi Nobusuke government. We extend our highest respect to the Japanese people who are persevering in their heroic struggle!
    U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the Chinese people, the Japanese people, and the people of the world. It establishes military bases everywhere and cobbles together military blocs. It directs the Kishi Nobusuke reactionary clique to antagonize the Chinese people and to occupy our territory of Taiwan. The Chinese people, the Japanese people, and the people of the world must wage a resolute struggle against it.
    We Chinese people have long suffered from the aggression of Japanese militarism, and many Asian countries have been ravaged by Japan's war of aggression. We absolutely cannot allow the U.S.-Japan reactionaries to carry out wars of aggression again on our territory or in any part of Southeast Asia, to realize the U.S. imperialist's heinous plan of using Asians to fight Asians. The Japanese people's struggle for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality is by no means isolated. It has the support of our 650 million Chinese people, the support of the people of Asian countries, and the support of all peace-loving people in the world. We hope that all patriotic forces in Japan will unite more closely, persevere in the struggle to the end, and final victory will surely belong to the great Japanese people!
    The people of Asian countries unite and resolutely support the just struggle of the Japanese people to extinguish Japanese militarism!
    The people of the whole world unite and overthrow U.S. imperialism!

    最后胜利一定属于伟大的日本人民
    中国国民党革命委员会副主席何香凝的讲话
    我们对于美日反动派互相勾结、积极复活日本军国主义、准备新的侵略战争的罪恶行为，表示无比的愤怒和坚决的反对；我们全力支持日本人民反对日美军事条约、反对美国帝国主义、打倒岸信介卖国政府的正义斗争，向再接再厉英勇斗争的日本人民致以崇高的敬意！
    美帝国主义是中国人民、日本人民和全世界人民最凶恶的敌人，它到处建立军事基地，拼凑军事集团，它指使岸信介反动集团敌视中国人民，侵占我国的领土台湾，中国人民、日本人民和全世界人民都必须同它进行坚决的斗争。
    我们中国人民曾经长期遭受日本军国主义的侵略，亚洲许多国家都受过日本侵略战争的蹂躏，我们绝对不能容许美日反动派再次在我国的领土，东南亚任何地方进行侵略战争，实现美帝国主义以亚洲人打亚洲人的罪恶计划。日本人民争取独立、民主、和平、中立的斗争决不是孤立的，有我们六万万五千万中国人民的支持，有亚洲各国人民的支持，有全世界一切爱好和平的人民的支持。我们希望日本一切爱国的力量更加紧密地团结起来，坚持斗争到底，最后胜利一定属于伟大的日本人民！
    亚洲各国人民团结起来，坚决支持日本人民的正义斗争，扑灭日本军国主义！
    全世界的人民团结起来，打倒美帝国主义！
