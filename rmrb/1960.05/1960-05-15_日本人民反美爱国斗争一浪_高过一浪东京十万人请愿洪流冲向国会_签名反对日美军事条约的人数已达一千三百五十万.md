Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 14th Dispatch: Today in Tokyo, 100,000 workers, students, women, and citizens from all walks of life braved the heavy rain, and like a rolling tide, staged a massive petition to the Diet, demanding the abolition of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," the Diet to pass a motion of no confidence in the Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet, and the dissolution of the Diet. Representatives from various regions submitted petitions with seven million signatures from across Japan to the Diet.

According to the Japan Socialist Party's announcement today, the number of people across Japan who have signed petitions to the Diet opposing the ratification of the new "Security Treaty" has reached 13.5 million by tonight. The vigorous development of the Japanese people's struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, wave after wave, demonstrates the Japanese people's indomitable and resolute will to oppose the aggression plot of U.S. imperialism and the Nobusuke Kishi government, and to strive for independence, peace, democracy, and neutrality.

In Tokyo, tens of thousands of petitioners held demonstrations on the streets of Tokyo after submitting their petitions to the Diet. The vicinity of the Japanese Diet and the center of Tokyo became an ocean of red flags, banners, and placards opposing the new "Security Treaty." The petitioning started at noon and continued until the evening.

At the beginning of the petition, the petition procession that assembled in Hibiya Park was led by 300 cultural figures as they marched toward the Diet. Ordinary citizens, members of the Japan-China Friendship Association, members of the Communist Party, and members of other people's organizations, as well as approximately 2,500 business people and entrepreneurs, followed. In the procession were also 15,000 representatives from various regions of Japan. Behind them was a continuous stream of government employees, public utility employees, members of various private enterprise unions, and thousands of other union members.

At the forefront of the first group of petitioners were well-known social leaders from all walks of life, including Iku Yasui, Yoshitaro Hirano, Yoko Matsuoka, and Koreya Senda. The demonstrators sang louder and louder, singing songs such as "We Fight for National Liberation." They carried various placards with slogans such as: "Black Jets Go Home!" "Reduce Taxes!" "Don't Buy Lockheed Planes!"

Mikuni Kozo, the Secretary-General of the "National Council to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty," emphasized at a rally in Hibiya Park, where all the petitioners gathered: "The crucial moment for our movement against this treaty has now arrived. Let us show our greatest strength and drown this treaty in the sea of ​​mass anger. Today's action will start a surging tide of the people."

Yoko Matsuoka, representative of the "Security Treaty Criticism Association," said at the rally that all patriotic and peace-loving people should now feel responsible for opening up a bright future for the country. Matsuoka emphasized, "Even if a large number of police officers surround the Diet, our firm will to oppose this treaty must break into the Diet."

Chairman of the Japanese Communist Party, Sanzo Nosaka, Chairman of the Socialist Party, Inejiro Asanuma, and other members of the two parties accepted petitions against the Security Treaty brought from all over the country near the entrance of the Diet. According to statistics, 500,000 petitions were received today.

After petitioning the Diet, union members and local representatives went to the Mitsui Mining Company's head office to protest the large-scale layoffs of miners and the killing of striking workers at the Miike Coal Mine.

At the same time, approximately 3,000 women in Tokyo held a rally in Chidorigafuchi Park in Tokyo. Participants in this mass rally included teachers, telecommunications workers, and female employees of public corporations. Also attending the rally were members of the Women's Democratic Club, the Japan Mothers' Congress Liaison Committee, and female members of the Socialist Party and the Communist Party. There were also many housewives with children and elderly women.

After holding the rally, they went to the Diet in heavy rain to submit their petitions against the Diet's ratification of the new "Security Treaty." Leading the procession were: female poet Sumako Fukao, women's organization leader Fuki Kushida, Natsu Kawasaki, and others.

Earlier, at the rally held in Chidorigafuchi Park, Socialist Party member of the House of Representatives, Ritsuko Toda, and member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, Satomi Hakamada, addressed the participants. Hakamada asked the participants to further strengthen their solidarity to crush the Nobusuke Kishi group's attempt to forcibly pass the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" in the Diet. He also asked the women attending the meeting to oppose U.S. President Eisenhower's visit to Japan.

At approximately the same time, 5,000 students and youths held a rally in Shimizu Valley Park and went to the Diet after the meeting to submit their petitions against the new "Security Treaty."

Speaking at the rally were Kiyohara Ozawa, representative of the "National Council to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty," Minoru Tanaka, representative of the Socialist Party, and Shoichi Kasuga, member of the Central Committee Secretariat of the Communist Party. In their speeches, they mentioned the demonstrations of the Chinese people supporting the Japanese people's struggle against the "Security Treaty" and emphasized that the Japanese people should intensify their struggle against the "Security Treaty."
