Xinhua News Agency, Changsha. A large stone arch bridge with a clear span of 65 meters, the Deshan Bridge in Changde, Hunan Province, has been successfully completed and a traffic opening ceremony was recently held.

This stone arch bridge with the largest span is another pioneering achievement after the Huanghugang Bridge in Shimen County, Hunan Province. The bridge is 95 meters long and 22.8 meters high, with a bridge deck width of 10.5 meters. In addition to the sidewalks on both sides, two cars can run side by side in the middle.

Deshan Port is a necessary route on the Changsha-Changde highway. Before the bridge was built, batches of vehicles often waited to cross due to the steep slopes and rapid currents, which affected the exchange of materials. Under the leadership of the Hunan Provincial Party Committee and the Changde Prefectural Party Committee, and with the support of relevant departments, the people of the Changde area began to build this bridge in November last year. Without using reinforced concrete or expert guidance, they completed the construction in just six months, and the quality fully met the requirements. In the process of construction, many difficulties were encountered, but they were all overcome by the wisdom and drive of the people. For example, when installing the bridge abutments, they encountered severe freezing, and the grout was not easy to solidify, and there was no calcium chloride as a setting accelerator, which brought great difficulties to the construction. They used boiling water to dissolve the ice, used table salt as a setting accelerator, and added a greenhouse in the workshop to increase the temperature, which not only ensured the smooth progress of the project but also ensured the quality of the project.

### 湖南建成65米跨径的大石拱桥

    湖南建成65米跨径的大石拱桥
    新华社长沙电　一孔净跨六十五米的石拱大桥——湖南省常德德山大桥，已经胜利竣工，并于最近举行了通车典礼。
    这个跨度最大的石拱大桥，是继湖南省石门县黄虎港大桥以后的又一创举。桥长九十五米，高二十二点八米，桥面宽十点五米，除了两边的人行道以外，中间可以并行两部汽车。
    德山港口是长（沙）常（德）公路的必经之地。建桥之前，这里由于山坡陡峭，水流湍急，常常有成批汽车等待过渡，影响了物资的交流。常德地区的人民，在中共湖南省委、常德地委的领导和有关部门的支持下，于去年11月开始修建这座大桥。他们不用钢筋水泥，没有专家指导，仅仅半年时间就修建完成，质量完全合乎要求。在修建过程中，曾经碰到许多困难，但是都被人民群众的智慧和干劲所克服了。比如在安砌桥头的时候，遇到了大冰冻，灰浆不易凝固，而且没有氯化钙作催凝剂，这给施工带来了极大的困难。他们就用开水溶解冰块，用食盐作催凝剂，并在工场加设暖棚提高温度，既保证了工程顺利施工，又保证了工程质量。
