Xinhua News Agency: Beijing railway workers have launched a massive campaign of "Using High Transportation to Guarantee High Steel Production," doing everything possible to improve transportation efficiency and ensure that blast furnaces and converters are well-fed. Since May, the average turnover of trains within 24 hours has increased from 3.5 times in March and April to 4.45 times.

With the continuous leap forward in steel production, the need for raw materials and fuels such as ore, limestone, and coal in various steel mills is constantly increasing. To ensure the continuous surge in steel production, railway workers have proposed: "We will guarantee to transport as much as production requires, and wherever it is needed!" They cooperated with coal mines in Mentougou, Chengzi, Muchengjian, and other places to establish coal loading chutes that can fill a long train at the same time, reducing the train's stop time for loading coal from the original two and a half hours to about one and a half hours. The stop time for trains at Sesufen Station has been reduced to 26 minutes. Workers at the Beijing Vehicle Depot have converted many vehicles into automatic door-opening vehicles, where ore, coal, and other materials are automatically discharged at the push of a valve, greatly improving unloading efficiency.

Workers have also strengthened and improved railway special lines and transportation tools, allowing trains to pull more and run faster. Coal and ore loading stations in western Beijing have generally extended the lines within the station, doubling the station's throughput. The Vehicle Depot has also organized a group of fixed train sets specifically for transporting coal and ore to some steel mills, which has also improved efficiency.

The relevant departments of production, transportation, and sales have jointly established a collaboration office at various transportation hubs to uniformly arrange cargo sources, long-distance and short-distance transportation, and loading and unloading work, which has also played a significant role in improving transportation efficiency. Dispatchers from various coal mines in western Beijing, dispatchers from nearby railway stations, and dispatchers from the Beijing Office of the Beijing Railway Bureau have implemented "Three Personnel, Three Unifications," namely unified planning, unified thinking, and unified action, to accelerate vehicle turnover, ensuring both urgent needs and preventing coal mines from affecting normal production due to coal storage backlog. Recently, relevant departments established a city-wide local transportation team command organization, and factories, mines, and transportation departments related to steel production have set up combat teams to ensure that production units have a sufficient source of goods; loading and unloading departments guarantee loading and unloading upon arrival; and transportation departments guarantee more hauling and faster running. Through this large-scale collaboration, railway transportation efficiency has greatly improved, playing a significant role in ensuring the leap forward in steel production.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an: After achieving "10,000 ton-kilometers" in automobile transportation in March, Shaanxi Province's average vehicle ton-month production of freight trucks reached 10,141 ton-kilometers in April. Furthermore, single vehicles achieving more than 60,000 ton-kilometers, teams achieving more than 40,000 ton-kilometers, and fleets achieving 28,000 ton-kilometers have emerged.

In order to strengthen the weak link of transportation, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China made a resolution in March to "Guarantee the realization of 10,000 ton-kilometers in April." Local Party committees, municipal committees, and county committees were all led by secretaries, with layers of division of labor and responsibility, vigorously grasping the "10,000 ton-kilometers" campaign. At the same time, a large army of highway maintenance workers was organized to launch a surprise attack on removing the "blind gut" sections of the highway trunk lines, adding a wear layer to more than 3,600 kilometers of highway trunk lines, greatly improving transportation conditions. To prevent trucks from returning empty, the province's trunk lines and branch lines, water transport and land transport, formed a complete transportation network, enabling various materials to be transferred in a timely manner out of the mountains, down the rivers, across the ravines, and over the rivers, concentrating a large amount of materials for highway trunk lines and ensuring that trucks can pull more and run more.

Entering April, automobile transportation workers across the province fought day and night, with competitions unfolding between groups and individuals. In terms of enterprise management, "twelve moving to the front lines" were implemented, meaning that from leading cadres to maintenance workers, cooks, medical staff, material personnel, dispatchers, and statisticians, all went to the production site to ensure the smooth operation of vehicles.

In carrying out the "10,000 ton-kilometers" campaign, automobile transportation companies in various places firmly grasped the key links of increasing double shifts, adding trailers, high-speed maintenance, and fast loading and unloading. Many automobile repair factories established trailer manufacturing workshops. Adopting the method of learning, researching, designing, and manufacturing simultaneously, they self-made large-tonnage trailers, enabling all transport enterprises' freight vehicles to be equipped with trailers, greatly increasing transport capacity.

In order to strengthen vehicle maintenance work, automobile transport companies generally promoted the method of setting up points along the route and mobile maintenance along the way, with maintenance workers carrying tools to patrol and repair along the highways. Many repair factories (yards) sought old waste materials and substitutes, vigorously repairing old parts and overhauling main vehicles and trailers, ensuring that maintenance tasks were completed in a timely manner.

Many cities, counties, and ports concentrated small freight yards into large freight yards, changing several loading and unloading points into one loading and unloading point, overcoming the phenomenon of a material having to undergo multiple transfers and multiple loading and unloading operations, which is of great benefit to accelerating vehicle turnover. Some transportation companies also created circular dispatch methods based on cargo and local conditions, changing automobile transportation from short-distance to long-distance, and from one-way to two-way, increasing vehicle ton production.

    多运快运保高产
    北京铁路职工加速车辆周转赶运钢厂“粮草”
    陕西省货运汽车平均车吨月产超过万吨公里
    新华社讯　北京铁路职工开展声势浩大的“以高运保钢铁高产”运动，千方百计提高运输效率，让高炉、转炉吃饱和吃好。5月份以来，火车在二十四小时内的平均周转次数已经由3、4月份的三点五次提高到四点四五次。
    随着钢铁生产的持续跃进，各钢铁厂对矿石、石灰石、煤炭等原料、燃料的需要不断增长。为了确保钢铁生产的不断高涨，铁路职工们提出：“生产要多少就保证运多少，哪里需要就运到哪里！”他们同门头沟、城子、木城涧等煤矿协作，建立了装煤溜坡仓，能把一长列火车同时装满，使火车停站装煤时间由原来的两个半小时缩短到一个半小时左右。色树坟车站的火车停站时间缩短到二十六分钟。北京车辆段的职工把许多车辆改成了自动开关门的车辆，一按汽门，车上的矿石、煤炭等就自动倾泻下来，大大提高了卸车效率。
    职工们还加强和改善了铁路专用线和交通运输工具，使火车拉得更多、跑得更快。京西各装煤、装矿石的火车站普遍延长了站内线路，使车站的吞吐量加大一倍。车辆段还组织了一批固定车底，专门为一些钢铁厂运煤和矿石，也提高了效率。
    产、运、销各有关部门在各个交通枢纽联合成立协作办公室，统一安排货源、长途短途运输和装卸工作，对提高运输效率也起了很大作用。京西各煤矿的调度员和附近各火车站调度员以及北京铁路局北京办事处的调度员，实行了“三员三统一”，即统一计划、统一思想、统一行动，加快了车辆周转，既保证了急需，又保证煤矿不会因煤仓积压而影响正常生产。最近，各有关部门成立了全市地方运输队伍指挥机构，和钢铁生产有关的工厂、矿山、交通运输部门分设了作战小组，做到生产单位保证有充足的货源；搬运、装卸部门保证随到随装，随到随卸；运输部门保证多拉快跑，通过这种大协作，铁路运输效率大有提高，对保证钢铁生产跃进起了很大的作用。
    新华社西安电　陕西省继3月份实现汽车运输“万吨公里”之后，4月份全省货运汽车平均车吨月产又达到一万零一百四十一个吨公里，而且出现了六万多吨公里的单车、四万吨公里以上的小组和二万八千吨公里的车队。
    为了加强交通运输工作这个薄弱环节，中共陕西省委在3月份作出了“保证4月份实现万吨公里省”的决议。各地委、市委、县委都由书记挂帅，层层分工包干负责，大抓“万吨公里”运动。同时，组织公路养护大军，突击割除公路干线上的“盲肠”路段，在三千六百多公里的公路干线上加铺了磨耗层，大大改善了运输条件。为了不让汽车回空，全省干线与支线，水运与陆运，组成了一个完整的运输网，使各种物资出山、下川、过沟、渡河都能及时转运，给公路干线集运了大批物资，保证了汽车能够多拉多跑。
    进入4月份以来，全省汽车运输职工昼夜奋战，组与组，人与人之间展开了追、赶、比竞赛。在企业管理工作上做到“十二搬家”，即从领导干部到保修工人、炊事员、医务员、材料员、调度员、统计员等，都走上生产现场，保证汽车顺利运行。
    在开展“万吨公里”运动中，各地汽车运输公司紧紧抓住了增开双班，加挂拖车，高速保修，快装快卸等环节。不少汽车保修厂都成立了挂车制造车间。采取边学习、边研究、边设计、边制造的方法，自制大吨位挂车，使所有运输企业的载货汽车都挂上拖车，大大增加了运量。
    为了加强车辆保修工作，各汽车运输公司普遍推行了沿线设点、沿途流动的保修方法，保修工人背着工具沿公路巡回维修。许多保修厂（场）寻找旧废料和代用品，大搞旧件修复和抢修主车、挂车，保证保修任务及时完成。
    许多市、县和港口、码头，把小货场集中为大货场，由几个装卸点集中为一个装卸点，克服了一种物资要经过多次倒运和多处装卸的现象，对加速车辆周转有很大好处。有些运输公司还因货、因地制宜创造了循环调度法，使汽车运输由短途变长途，单程变双程，提高了车吨产量。
