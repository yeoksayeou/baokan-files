Xinhua News Agency, May 21st: Washington News: After sabotaging the Paris Four-Power Summit, US President Eisenhower returned to Washington yesterday. Before returning home, Eisenhower visited Portugal on the 19th for a day, holding talks with the Portuguese dictator Salazar.

In a speech at Washington Airport, Eisenhower admitted that the United States did not want to solve any problems at the Four-Power Summit. He said, "When we planned to attend the summit conference," "hopes were not high."

Eisenhower vehemently attacked the Soviet Union for "distorting and exaggerating the U-2 incident," slandering the Soviet Union as apparently "not wanting to conduct any kind of negotiations, and in fact making it impossible to start negotiations."

In his speech, Eisenhower greatly praised British Prime Minister Macmillan and French President de Gaulle for their roles as accomplices in sabotaging the summit. He said that their "behavior was excellent." "They unanimously expressed support with our delegation for what we believe is correct, proper, and reasonable."

    艾森豪威尔溜回华盛顿
    承认美国不想解决问题并诬蔑苏联不愿谈判
    新华社21日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔在破坏了巴黎四国政府首脑会议后在昨天回到华盛顿。艾森豪威尔在回国前曾经在19日到葡萄牙进行了一天访问，同葡萄牙独裁者萨拉查举行了会谈。
    艾森豪威尔在华盛顿机场上发表的谈话中，承认美国并不想在四国政府首脑会议上解决什么问题。他说，“当我们计划去参加最高级会议时”，“希望是不太高的”。
    艾森豪威尔极力攻击苏联“歪曲和渲染U—2事件”，诬蔑苏联显然“不希望进行任何种类的谈判，而且事实上使得谈判不可能开始”。
    艾森豪威尔在谈话中大大赞扬英国首相麦克米伦和法国总统戴高乐在破坏首脑会议中的帮凶作用。他说，他们两人的“行为是极好的”。“他们同我们的代表团异口同声地表示支持我们认为是正确、正当的和合理的东西。”
