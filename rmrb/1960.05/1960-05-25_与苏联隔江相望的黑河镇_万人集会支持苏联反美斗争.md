Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, May 24th: Heihe Town, located in our northern border province of Heilongjiang, across the river from the Soviet Union, held a rally and demonstration parade on the evening of the 22nd, with over 10,000 people participating. The participants supported the Soviet government's solemn stance and angrily condemned the American imperialists for sabotaging the Four-Power Summit.

The people of Heihe Town spent fourteen years of hardship under the bloody rule of Japanese imperialism, and were first liberated by the Soviet Red Army in 1945. The crimes of American imperialism in invading the Soviet Union and sabotaging the Four-Power Summit aroused great indignation among the people of Heihe Town. Waving flags and raising their fists, they shouted angrily: "Oppose the American imperialists' aggression and provocation against the Soviet Union!" "People of the world, unite and overthrow American imperialism!"

Wang Shutang, First Secretary of the CPC Heihe Prefectural Committee, spoke at the meeting on behalf of the 300,000 people of Heihe Prefecture, expressing resolute support for the Soviet Union's just stance and opposing the American imperialists' sabotage of the Four-Power Summit. He said: We, the people of the Heihe region, stand together with the people of the whole country, forever with the great Soviet people, with the people of all socialist countries, and with all peace-loving people around the world, to strengthen unity, heighten vigilance, and wage unremitting struggle to completely crush the war schemes of American imperialism.

After the meeting, the masses held a demonstration parade.
