Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 18th. Shanghai people from all walks of life have recently launched extensive and in-depth activities to resolutely support the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.
　　In recent days, the vast number of workers, peasants, students, cadres, neighborhood residents, literary and art workers, and industrialists and businessmen in Shanghai have held forums and report meetings, and have also created wall newspapers, drawn cartoons, written poems, and composed music to express the concern and support of the ten million people of Shanghai for the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic struggle.
　　At the recently concluded Third Session of the Third Shanghai Municipal People's Congress, the people's representatives unanimously and severely condemned the various crimes of U.S. imperialism during the discussions. Worker representative Wu Furen said: "Wherever U.S. imperialism goes, the people there suffer. We Chinese workers have suffered a lot from imperialism, and we fully understand the painful lives of the Japanese people today. We regard the struggle of the Japanese people as our own struggle and resolutely support them in fighting to the end. Syngman Rhee's fate is bound to be the same as Syngman Rhee's, and U.S. imperialism will not live long either." Many representatives also used many facts to expose the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism. They pointed out that as long as the people of the world unite, they will surely be able to smash the U.S. imperialist aggression plans and war conspiracies.
　　The U.S.-Japan reactionary clique's conspiracy to plan a new war has angered the working masses of Shanghai. Many of the more than 3,000 employees of the Zhabei District Production and Processing Company personally suffered the barbaric persecution of the Japanese invading army during the "January 28th" and "August 13th" Japanese fascist invasions of China. At a recent rally, they sternly denounced the U.S. imperialist collusion with Japanese reactionaries to plot a new war, and expressed their complete support for the just struggle of the Japanese people against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.
　　Shanghai's poets, painters, and musicians have tightly grasped their literary and artistic weapons and plunged into the patriotic and just struggle to support the Japanese people. Poets have written a large number of poetry leaflets. Eleven painters from the Artists Association painted fifteen cartoons such as "Oppose the U.S.-Japan Military Alliance Treaty" in one day. The Shanghai Concert Hall, which is hosting the first "Shanghai Spring" music concert, resounded with the majestic songs of "Supporting the Just Struggle of the Japanese People" recently created by music workers.
　　Shanghai newspapers have recently used a large amount of space to publish reports from all over the country supporting the Japanese people's opposition to the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and reports of the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic struggle. On the 16th, the Liberation Daily, the News Daily, and the Wenhui Daily all published editorials. The editorial departments of Shanghai newspapers and the Shanghai People's Broadcasting Station have received a large number of letters from people from all walks of life in recent days. These letters unanimously condemned the U.S. imperialist war conspiracy to revive Japanese militarism and supported the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic just struggle.

  Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 18th. The people of Wuhan have launched extensive activities in recent days to support the Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.
　　Many people who had been harmed by Japanese fascists were extremely angry when they heard that the U.S.-Japan reactionaries were planning a new war of aggression. In recent days, they have held rallies one after another to angrily accuse the Japanese fascists of the heinous crimes they committed during their occupation of Wuhan. Zong Hua'an, a seventy-three-year-old member of the Xianfeng People's Commune, was wounded in the waist by the Japanese invading army, and the wound still often aches. At a rally, he said with excitement: "U.S. imperialism is colluding with Japanese reactionaries to rearm Japan and wants to invade our country again. We will never agree!"
　　The Hubei Daily and the Yangtze River Daily have recently received a large number of letters from workers, students, and government cadres. In their letters, they expressed their firm support for the just struggle of the Japanese people and their opposition to the revival of Japanese militarism. Students from universities and colleges have also posted large-character posters or protest letters, expressing their determination to fully support the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle.
　　The workers of Wuhan, who have a rich revolutionary tradition, are very angry about the U.S. imperialist conspiracy to revive Japanese militarism. Wen Liang, an old "February 7th" worker at the Jiang'an Vehicle Factory, said excitedly: "The U.S. and Japanese reactionaries should open their eyes and see that today's China is no longer a China that imperialism can arbitrarily control. Anyone who wants to be an enemy of the Chinese people again will surely be bloody-nosed." Wang Qinan, an overseas Chinese who returned from Japan, said: "The Japanese people now are not the same as the Japanese people before, and their awareness has been greatly improved. During our days in Japan, we deeply felt that the vast number of Japanese people love peace and oppose war. U.S. imperialism wants to arm Japan, attempting to make Japanese militarism make a comeback, is bound to suffer a complete defeat."

    上海人民怒斥美日反动派侵略阴谋
    武汉工人说与中国人民为敌者必将碰得头破血流
    据新华社上海18日电　上海各界人民连日来广泛深入地展开各种活动，坚决支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的爱国正义斗争。
    上海市广大工人、农民、学生、干部、里弄居民、文艺工作者、工商界人士，最近几天纷纷举行座谈会、报告会，并且出墙报、画漫画、写诗、作曲等，表达上海一千万人民对日本人民反美爱国斗争的关怀与支援。
    在刚刚闭幕的上海市第三届人民代表大会第三次会议上，人民代表们在讨论中一致严厉谴责美帝国主义的种种罪恶行为。工人代表邬富仁说：美帝国主义到那里，那里的人民就遭殃。我们中国工人吃过帝国主义很多苦头，对于日本人民今天的痛苦生活，我们是完全理解的。我们把日本人民的斗争，当作自己的斗争，坚决支持他们斗争到底。岸信介的命运必然和李承晚一样，美帝国主义的寿命也不长了。许多代表还用许多事实揭露了美帝国主义的侵略本性，他们指出，只要全世界人民团结起来，就一定能够粉碎美帝国主义的侵略计划和战争阴谋。
    美日反动派策划新战争的阴谋，激怒了上海的工人群众。闸北区生产加工公司的三千多位职工，有不少都在“一·二八”“八·一三”日本法西斯侵略中国时，亲身遭受到日本侵略军的野蛮残害。他们在最近举行的集会上严厉痛斥美帝国主义勾结日本反动派策划新战争的罪恶阴谋，表示完全站在日本人民一边，坚决支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的正义斗争。
    上海的诗人、画家、音乐家紧握文艺武器投入了支持日本人民的爱国正义斗争。诗人们写了大批诗传单。美术家协会的十一个画家一天就画出了“反对日美军事同盟条约”等十五幅漫画。正在举行第一届“上海之春”音乐会演的上海音乐厅，响起了音乐工作者最近创作的“支持日本人民正义斗争”的雄壮歌声。
    上海各报最近以来用大量篇幅登载了全国各地人民支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的报道和日本人民反美爱国斗争的报道，16日，解放日报、新闻日报、文汇报都发表了社论。上海各报编辑部和上海人民广播电台连日收到各界人民的大批来信。这些来信一致斥责美帝国主义复活日本军国主义的战争阴谋、支持日本人民的反美爱国正义斗争。
  据新华社武汉18日电　武汉人民连日来广泛举行活动，支援日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争。
    许多曾经遭受日本法西斯残害的人们，听到美日反动派策划新的侵略战争时，都愤怒万分。他们连日纷纷举行集会，愤怒控诉日本法西斯在侵占武汉时期犯下的滔天罪行。先锋人民公社社员、七十三岁的宗华安，曾被日本侵略军打伤腰部，至今伤处还时常作痛，他在一次集会上激昂地说：“美帝国主义勾结日本反动派重新武装日本，再想侵略我国，我们坚决不答应！”
    湖北日报和长江日报最近收到了大量工人、学生、机关干部的来信，他们在信中表示坚决支持日本人民的正义斗争，反对复活日本军国主义。大专学校的学生们还纷纷张贴大字报或抗议书，表示要全力支援日本人民的爱国正义斗争。
    富有革命传统的武汉工人，对美帝国主义复活日本军国主义的阴谋感到十分愤怒。江岸车辆厂“二七”老工人文良激动地说：“美日反动派应该睁眼看看，今天的中国早已不是帝国主义可以任意宰割的中国了。谁要再想与中国人民为敌，一定会被碰得头破血流。”从日本回国的华侨王其南说：“现在日本人民也不是以前的日本人民了，他们的觉悟有了很大提高。我们在日本的日子里，深深感到广大日本人民是热爱和平、反对战争的。美帝国主义要武装日本，企图使日本军国主义东山再起，一定要遭到彻底的失败。”
