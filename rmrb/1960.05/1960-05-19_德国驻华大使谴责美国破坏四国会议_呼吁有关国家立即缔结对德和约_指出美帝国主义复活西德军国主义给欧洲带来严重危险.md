Xinhua News Agency, May 18th: The Ambassador of the German Democratic Republic to China, Wang Guozhen, today strongly condemned US imperialism for sabotaging the four-government summit conference. He called on relevant countries to immediately conclude a peace treaty with Germany and resolutely stop the resurgence of West German militarist forces.

Ambassador Wang Guozhen made the above statement at a press conference held by the embassy today for Chinese and foreign journalists.

At the press conference, the embassy distributed to Chinese and foreign journalists a memorandum submitted by the government of the German Democratic Republic to the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France on May 13 in preparation for the summit meeting. The Ambassador said that although the summit meeting did not take place for well-known reasons, the practical value and reality of the memorandum were not affected in the slightest, and the issue of German peaceful reunification remains the most pressing issue of concern to people all over the world.

In response to questions raised by Chinese journalists, Ambassador Wang Guozhen expressed his support for the statement made by Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev at the preliminary meeting of the summit, saying, "We resolutely condemn all provocative activities against the summit meeting, including the serious provocations of US imperialism and the provocations of West German militarists."

Ambassador Wang Guozhen said that the government and people of the German Democratic Republic very much hoped that the summit meeting would be successful. However, German militarists and revanchists, as well as US imperialism colluding with them, seriously undermined the summit meeting. He said that Adenauer openly applauded the US aggressive activities because he recognized that it was precisely this "shameful action that most seriously endangered the summit meeting."

Ambassador Wang Guozhen said, "We regret the current acts of sabotage, but we must, together with the Soviet Union, attribute the responsibility for the sabotage entirely to the provokers of the Cold War and hot war. The people of the German Democratic Republic will certainly unanimously and resolutely condemn them."

Speaking on the issue of concluding a peace treaty with Germany, Ambassador Wang Guozhen said that the German Democratic Republic regards the conclusion of a peace treaty with the two German states as the most important way to peacefully resolve the German question.

He emphasized that if Western countries evade or delay the conclusion of a peace treaty, the German Democratic Republic will conclude a treaty with countries willing to do so.

The Ambassador further pointed out that it is impossible to resolve the German question without listening to the views of the German Democratic Republic.

Ambassador Wang Guozhen and other embassy officials spoke about the serious danger posed by US imperialism's revival of West German militarism. They pointed out that at the beginning of this year, the West German army already possessed more than one hundred atomic weapons delivery systems, which will reach two hundred and twenty next year, and will have nine hundred atomic weapons delivery systems by 1963, including five hundred aircraft carrying atomic bombs. At the same time, the West German army will also grow to 350,000 men by the beginning of next year. They emphasized that according to the lessons of the two world wars, German militarists will not correctly understand the balance of world power. Therefore, there is a serious danger in Europe that West Germany will attack the German Democratic Republic by force. In the first three months of this year alone, they provoked 520 border incidents.

When Ambassador Wang Guozhen and the embassy counselor talked about the situation in West Berlin, they said that eliminating the danger of war from West Berlin is urgently needed. They accused Western countries of unreasonably rejecting the proposal to turn West Berlin into a demilitarized free city.

They revealed that Adenauer had openly clamored "rather no agreement," and he tried his best to obstruct negotiations and reach an agreement, because any agreement would be unfavorable to imperialism.

    德国驻华大使谴责美国破坏四国会议
    呼吁有关国家立即缔结对德和约
    指出美帝国主义复活西德军国主义给欧洲带来严重危险
    新华社18日讯　德意志民主共和国驻华大使汪戴尔今天严厉谴责美帝国主义破坏四国政府首脑会议。他呼吁有关国家应该立即缔结对德和约，坚决制止西德军国主义势力再起。
    汪戴尔大使是在今天大使馆举行的中外记者招待会上发表上述声明的。
    在记者招待会上，大使馆向中外记者散发了德意志民主共和国政府为准备最高级会议而于5月13日向苏联、美国、英国和法国四国政府提出的备忘录。大使说，虽然最高级会议由于众所周知的原因而并没有举行，但是备忘录的实际价值和现实性丝毫没有受到影响，德国和平统一问题仍旧是全世界人民关心的最迫切问题。
    汪戴尔大使在答复中国记者所提出的问题时，表示支持苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在首脑会议预备会上所发表的声明，他说，“我们坚决谴责一切对最高级会议的挑衅活动，包括美帝国主义的严重挑衅和西德军国主义者的挑衅”。
    汪戴尔大使说，德意志民主共和国政府和人民非常希望最高级会议取得成功。可是德国军国主义者和复仇主义者以及和他们相勾结的美帝国主义，却对最高级会议进行了严重的破坏。他说，阿登纳公开为美国的侵略活动喝采，因为他认识到，正是美国的“这一可耻行动最严重地危害了最高级会议”。
    汪戴尔大使说，“我们对现在的破坏行为表示遗憾，但是我们必须同苏联一起把破坏的责任完全归之于冷战和热战的挑衅者，德意志民主共和国人民肯定一致地坚决谴责他们”。
    在谈到缔结对德和约问题时，汪戴尔大使说，德意志民主共和国把对两个德国缔结和约当作和平解决德国问题的最主要的途径。
    他强调说，如果西方国家躲避或拖延缔结和约，德意志民主共和国将和愿与它缔约的国家缔约。
    大使进一步指出，不听取德意志民主共和国的意见，要解决德国问题是不可能的。
    汪戴尔大使和使馆其他官员谈到了美帝国主义复活西德军国主义所带来的严重危险。他们指出，今年年初，西德军队就已拥有一百多个原子武器投射手段，明年将达到二百二十个，并将在1963年拥有包括五百架携带原子炸弹的飞机在内的九百个原子武器投射手段。同时，西德军队也将在明年初发展到三十五万人。他们强调指出，根据两次世界大战的教训，德国军国主义者是不会正确地认识世界力量对比的，因此，在欧洲就存在着西德以武力进攻德意志民主共和国的严重危险。而仅仅在今年前三个月，他们就挑起五百二十次边境挑衅事件。
    汪戴尔大使和使馆参赞谈到西柏林局势问题时说，消除来自西柏林的战争危险，是迫切需要的。他们指责西方国家无理拒绝把西柏林变成非军事化的自由城市的建议。
    他们揭露说，阿登纳曾经公开叫嚣“宁可不要协定”，他极力阻挠谈判和达成协定，因为任何协定都是对帝国主义不利的。
