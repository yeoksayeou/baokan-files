Raging Waves on the Huangpu River
Xinhua News Agency Correspondent in Shanghai

Shanghai, China's largest city, standing on the east coast of the Asian continent, was a city in turmoil on the 22nd, with over three million people from all walks of life holding an unprecedented large-scale demonstration and rally. Slogans firmly supporting the Soviet government's solemn stand against U.S. imperialism's aggression and strongly condemning U.S. imperialism's sabotage of the Four-Power Summit resounded along both banks of the Huangpu River for dozens of miles.

Always with the Soviet Union

From the moment the people of Shanghai heard the news of the U.S. imperialist spy plane intruding into Soviet airspace, they denounced this new crime of U.S. imperialism with the utmost anger, as if our own airspace had been violated. As Eisenhower and the U.S. government engaged in shameless denials and persisted in their policy of aggression, brazenly sabotaging the Four-Power Summit, the anger of the Shanghai people surged higher and higher. Workers and peasants, professors and students, writers and actors, organized neighborhood women, white-haired elderly, and Young Pioneers wearing red scarves, men and women, young and old, unanimously expressed their support for the Soviet government's just stand. People firmly stated at rallies and during demonstrations: The people of China and the Soviet Union are one family, forever inseparable; an invasion of the Soviet Union is an invasion of our country.

On the 22nd, People's Square in the city center was a sea of people, a forest of red flags, with hundreds of thousands of people holding the "Shanghai People's Rally to Support the Soviet Union's Just Stand and Oppose U.S. Imperialism's Sabotage of the Four-Power Summit." Before the start of the rally, the entire audience sang "The Chinese and Soviet People Are Closely United." The famous choral conductor Situ Han stood on the high platform, waving a red flag, excitedly conducting hundreds of thousands of people to sing again and again: "Closely united, closely united, the Chinese and Soviet people are of one heart..." The unbreakable bond of friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union filled the entire venue.

In the demonstration processions on the streets, people circulated hastily written poetry leaflets by writers. Every line and sentence of these poems supported the Soviet Union and opposed the aggressive crimes of U.S. imperialism. The poet Yu Zhi wrote in his poem: "The Chinese people stand together with the Soviet people, forming an iron wall of bronze. Whoever dares to touch us, Hitler and Tojo are their examples!" Painters Cai Zhenhua, Yue Xiaoying, Ye Miao, and others also joined the writers and poets in compiling an album of "Poetry and Painting Gallery," depicting the image of the Chinese and Soviet people united in angrily beating the American wolf.

In the demonstration procession in front of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Building, an elderly man with white hair – Chen Lide, a veteran Red Army soldier who participated in the October Revolution – was particularly noticeable. He had fought alongside the Soviet people against imperialist interventionist forces and White bandits. He said that at that time, the Soviet state was still young, and the Red Army completely repelled the imperialist invasion. During the Second World War, German fascists invaded the Soviet Union, and ultimately met their destruction. But U.S. imperialism does not accept these lessons, and continues to invade the Soviet Union and our country. The unity of the socialist camp, led by the Soviet Union, is as solid as a rock. An invasion of the Soviet Union is an invasion of China, an invasion of the entire socialist camp. We have enough strength to wipe it out completely!

Wolf is Always a Wolf

Shanghai's ten thousand steelworkers held extensive rallies and demonstrations. They shouted out steel-like voices: A wolf is always a wolf, U.S. imperialism is always U.S. imperialism; we must not harbor any illusions about it.

Workers of the middle shift of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 had just finished their shift. They didn't even have time to change out of their canvas work clothes, soaked in sweat. They shouldered rifles and machine guns and gathered from all directions to the square to hold a rally, organized according to the militia's formations. The venue's broadcasting system extended all the way to the steelmaking furnace, and the same slogan was heard throughout the plant: Support the Soviet Union's just stand against U.S. imperialism's aggression and provocation; down with U.S. imperialism! In Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3, the famous steelmaking expert Han Xinliang spoke at a rally of more than 10,000 people, saying: U.S. imperialism's sabotage of the Four-Power Summit was premeditated. This is the nature of the aggressor, and it is not surprising at all.

The broad masses of Catholics in Shanghai, who have actively participated in patriotic anti-imperialist struggles in recent years and recently self-elected a bishop, also participated in rallies and demonstrations on the 22nd. Zhang Jiashu, the new bishop of the Shanghai Diocese, who was conducting a "pilgrimage" at the Sheshan Catholic Church in the suburbs, rushed back to Xujiahui Catholic Church in the afternoon to participate in the rally and demonstration of the Shanghai Patriotic Catholic Association. More than thirty priests, heads of parish associations in the urban area, and Catholic men and women, most of whom were witnesses, jurors, and observers in the recent public trial and sentencing of American spy Walter, participated in the rally. Zhang Jiashu said that the U.S. imperialist ruling clique, headed by Eisenhower, once feigned a peaceful posture, attempting to confuse and deceive the people of the world. But imperialism is always imperialism. No matter how it disguises itself, its aggressive nature will never change. Facts have proven that carrying out espionage and aggressive activities against socialist countries is a consistent practice of U.S. imperialism. Sending Walter to China to carry out espionage and subversive activities is one example, and sending spy planes to intrude into Soviet airspace is another example. Catholics in Shanghai will certainly stand together with the people of the whole country, firmly support the Soviet government's solemn stand, and fight U.S. imperialism to the end.

Yang Zengnian, a Catholic who served as a juror in the Shanghai People's Court during the trial of the Walter spy case, said excitedly: U.S. imperialism's aggressive nature and robber logic are not unfamiliar to Catholics in Shanghai. Just two months ago, when the Shanghai People's Court solemnly sanctioned Walter, a veteran American spy who had been carrying out espionage activities under the guise of religion for a long time, even though the evidence was as solid as a mountain, the U.S. State Department and the likes of Herter still made shameless denials, claiming that Walter's espionage activities were purely a "religious mission," saying that Walter was an "innocent American citizen," and accusing China of "persecuting religion." U.S. imperialism's trick of denying that it sent spy planes to violate Soviet sovereignty and sabotage the Four-Power Summit is the same.

Double the Counterattack

The people of Shanghai are not only familiar with the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialist wolves, but also familiar with ways to deal with this wolf. They pointed out that the best way to deal with U.S. imperialism is to double the counterattack.

The employees of the Shanghai Locomotive Depot of the Shanghai Railway Bureau, who once rushed to the front lines of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, have a deeper understanding of this point. From the Party Committee Secretary and Deputy Director to the Workshop Director, and all the way down to the drivers and technicians, this locomotive depot is full of heroes from the steel transportation lines on the Korean battlefield. They personally competed with U.S. imperialism on the Korean battlefield. On the 22nd, more than 300 of them held a rally to support the Soviet Union's solemn stand and oppose U.S. imperialism's aggression.

Jiang Hongshou, the deputy captain of the locomotive team, a driver who had been awarded three merits in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, said that at the beginning of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, U.S. imperialism was extremely crazy, bombing our transportation lines day and night. Many lines and bridges were blown up, but our transportation lines were unbreakable and indestructible steel transportation lines. The enemy's planes were often shot down by us, crashing and burning. A few years ago, U.S. imperialism was our defeated opponent in Korea. Now we are even stronger, and the socialist camp is even stronger. If it dares to invade again, we must make it die without a burial place.

Cheng Xiuying, a resident of Luwan District, is a glorious mother. She has ten children. After her eldest son gloriously sacrificed in the Battle of Shangganling, she sent two more sons to join the army. This time, when she heard that the American bandits dared to invade the Soviet Union, she said that the only way to deal with the enemy is to strike them hard. If they want to make trouble, let them bump into walls and break their noses. A few days ago, she wrote a letter to her second son, who is in an artillery unit, asking him to increase his vigilance and defend the security of the motherland and world peace.

The anger towards U.S. imperialism broke through the tranquility of the hospital. At a rally of more than 700 medical personnel at the Shanghai First People's Hospital, Tang Xiaojun and other five medical personnel who had been to the Korean front line exposed the crimes of U.S. imperialism in Korea, including killing, burning, raping, and conducting germ warfare. They said: U.S. imperialism is ultimately a paper tiger. It poured countless tons of steel onto Shangganling, but could not move forward a single step. Under the resolute blows of the Chinese and Korean people, batches of American soldiers became prisoners. Today, U.S. imperialism, with its aggressive nature, has forgotten the lessons it learned in Korea. We love peace, but we will never beg for peace from imperialism. The War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea taught us that only through resolute struggle can we achieve peace. Tang Xiaojun said: "We warn the imperialists: If you dare to launch a war, we must eliminate you like eliminating germs!"

Never Relax Vigilance

The powerful militia队伍, wearing neat uniforms and carrying various light and heavy weapons, participated in the rally in the city center on the 22nd, holding high the flags of the "Militia Division" and "Militia Regiment" in a majestic manner. In this mighty队伍, there was Qiu Qiankang, a retired soldier of the Volunteer Army who had participated in the world-famous Battle of Shangganling and a member of the Shanghai Gas Company's militia. He said passionately: "We will never relax our vigilance against U.S. imperialism, which has an aggressive nature." While sending representatives to participate in the rally in the city center, the broad masses of officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai on land, sea, and air strictly adhered to their combat readiness positions, listening to the live broadcast of the rally on warships, next to airplanes, or on artillery positions. They resolutely responded to General Xiao Hua's call to closely watch the war conspiracies of U.S. imperialism with high vigilance. Li Yongnian, a pilot from a certain Air Force unit who had shot down an American-made Chiang Kai-shek plane over Shanghai, said: "We love peace, but we are not afraid of war. If the aggressors want to launch a war, we will fight to their lair and eliminate them completely!"

The employees of the Yangshupu Power Plant, who had fought against the American and Japanese invaders for a decade or two before liberation, held continuous rallies these days. The new crime of American planes invading the Soviet Union reminded the workers once again of the heinous crimes committed by American-made Chiang Kai-shek planes bombing Shanghai on February 6 ten years ago. On the afternoon of the 22nd, many old workers who had been injured in the "February 6" bombing and had repaired the factory after the bombing held a rally. Zhang Heng, an elderly worker with 41 years of work experience, said: Ten years ago, we drove U.S. imperialism out of the mainland and repaired the bombed factory with our own hands. In the past ten years, we have used our own hands to manage this power plant, which U.S. imperialism said we could not manage, in an orderly manner. Today, ten years later, U.S. imperialism is plotting new war conspiracies. We must raise our vigilance and fight it resolutely.

People of the World Unite,
Down with U.S. Imperialism!

Friends from 20 countries around the world participated in the rally in People's Square on the 22nd. They stood together with the people of Shanghai to oppose U.S. imperialism's aggression and provocation against the Soviet Union. In the ocean of people, people of different skin colors stretched out angry fists together, shouting unified slogans loudly in different languages; peace-loving people of the world are linked together in struggle. Masao Komori, the deputy head of the delegation of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan visiting China, pointed out: "These spy planes of U.S. imperialism that invaded the Soviet Union also exist on the U.S. military bases in Japan. Their spearhead is aimed at China, the Soviet Union, and other socialist countries. This shows that U.S. imperialism is our common enemy."

Fezer Paul, a member of the Cameroonian Youth Delegation from the fighting African continent, said excitedly: "U.S. imperialism has sabotaged the Four-Power Summit. It is the most ferocious enemy of the people of the world. It invades everywhere. Now the people of the world are rising up against it, and its lifespan is not long."

Foreign sailors who came to Shanghai Port from across the ocean expressed their anger at the imperialist war provocation as soon as they landed. Many people also participated in the Shanghai people's rallies and demonstrations on the 22nd. Midanov, the political commissar of the Bulgarian ship "Peace," who came to Shanghai Port for the first time, denounced the evil provocations of U.S. imperialism when he gathered with sailors from the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and China after landing. Czech sailor Zacek participated in the Shanghai people's rally. His mother was imprisoned in a concentration camp by the German fascists during the Second World War, suffering all kinds of torture, and was finally liberated by the Soviet Red Army. He said: "The people of the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia forged an unforgettable, fighting friendship in the anti-fascist struggle. U.S. imperialism's aggression against the Soviet Union is an aggression against Czechoslovakia and an aggression against the entire socialist camp. We will never allow it!"

The Shanghai people's rally and demonstration on the 22nd to oppose U.S. imperialism once again demonstrated the close unity of the people of China and the Soviet Union, the people of socialist countries, and the peace-loving people of the world. This is an invincible force. The power of the people will surely defeat the war forces of imperialism and win lasting peace in the world.

    黄浦江上的怒涛
    新华社驻上海记者
    屹立在亚洲大陆东海岸的我国最大城市上海，22日全市沸腾，三百多万各界人民举行了空前规模的大示威、大集会。坚决支持苏联政府反对美帝国主义侵略的严正立场、强烈谴责美帝国主义破坏四国首脑会议的口号声，响彻了连绵数十里的黄浦江两岸。
    永远和苏联在一起
    上海人民从听到美帝国主义间谍飞机侵入苏联领空的消息开始，就像我国自己的领空被侵犯一样，以最大的愤怒申斥美帝国主义的这个新的罪行。随着艾森豪威尔和美国政府进行无耻抵赖和坚持侵略政策并且悍然地破坏四国首脑会议，上海人民的愤怒越来越高涨。工人和农民，教授和学生，作家和演员，组织起来的里弄妇女，白发苍苍的老人，以及系着红领巾的少先队员，男女老少，万众一心地表示支持苏联政府的正义立场。人们在集会上和举行示威游行的时候坚定地表示：中苏两国人民是一家，永远不可分，对苏联的侵略就是对我国的侵略。
    22日，市中心的人民广场上人山人海，红旗如林，有几十万人在这里举行“上海各界人民支持苏联正义立场，反对美帝国主义破坏四国首脑会议大会”。大会开始之前，全场高唱“中苏人民团结紧”。著名的合唱指挥家司徒汉站在高高的台上，手挥红旗，激动地指挥着几十万群众一遍又一遍地引吭高唱：“团结紧，团结紧，中苏人民一条心……”。中苏两国人民牢不可破的团结的感情，洋溢着全场。
    在大街上示威的行列里，人们传颂着作家们赶写的诗传单。这些诗的每行每句都是拥护苏联反对美帝国主义侵略罪行的。诗人于之写的诗中说：“中国人民同苏联人民站在一起，连成铁壁铜墙。谁敢来碰碰我们，希特勒、东条就是他们的榜样！”画家蔡振华、乐小英、叶苗等也同作家、诗人们一起赶编了“诗画廊”的专辑，画出了中苏两国人民团结一起怒打美国狼的形象。
    在中苏友好大厦前的示威行列中，特别受人注意的是一位白发苍苍的老人——参加十月革命的老红军战士陈立德。他曾经同苏联人民并肩与帝国主义干涉军和白匪军作战。他说，那时苏维埃国家还在年青时代，红军就彻底打退了帝国主义的侵犯。第二次世界大战德国法西斯侵略苏联，最后以毁灭告终。可是美帝国主义不接受这些教训，还在不断侵犯苏联和我国。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结坚如磐石，对苏联的侵犯就是对中国、对整个社会主义阵营的侵犯，我们有足够的力量把它消灭得干干净净！
        狼总是狼
    上海十万钢铁大军广泛地举行了集会和示威。他们呼喊出钢铁般的声音：狼总是狼，美帝国主义总是美帝国主义，绝不能对它存在任何幻想。
    上钢一厂的中班工人刚下班，被汗水湿透了的帆布工作服也来不及换，就背上步枪、机枪、按照民兵的编队组织，从四面八方齐集到广场上举行大会。会场的广播机一直通到炼钢炉前，全厂到处发出同一个呼声：支持苏联对美帝国主义侵略和挑衅的正义立场，打倒美帝国主义！在上钢三厂，著名炼钢能手韩忻亮在一万多人的大会上讲话，他说：美帝国主义破坏四国首脑会议是早有准备的，这正是侵略者的本性，一点也不奇怪。
    几年来积极参加爱国反帝斗争、最近自选主教的上海市广大天主教徒，22日也纷纷参加集会和示威。正在郊区佘山圣母堂进行“朝圣”的天主教上海教区新主教张家树，午后赶回徐家汇天主堂参加了上海市天主教友爱国会的集会和示威。参加集会的各堂的神甫、市区教友会负责人和男女教友三十多人，他们大多数是不久前上海市人民法院公审和判决美国间谍华里柱一案的证人、陪审员和旁听者。张家树说，以艾森豪威尔为首的美帝国主义统治集团，曾经伪装和平姿态，妄图迷惑和欺骗世界人民，但是帝国主义总是帝国主义，不管怎样伪装，它的侵略本性总是不会改的。事实证明，对社会主义阵营各国进行间谍和侵略活动，已是美帝国主义的一贯行径，派遣华里柱来我国进行间谍和颠复活动是一例，派遣间谍飞机侵入苏联领空又是一例。上海市天主教徒一定和全国人民一起，坚决支持苏联政府的严正立场，和美帝国主义斗争到底。
    曾在审判华里柱间谍案中，担任上海市人民法院陪审员的教徒杨增年激动地说：美帝国主义的侵略本性和强盗逻辑，对于上海天主教友来说，并不陌生。就在两个月以前，上海市人民法院严正制裁了长期披着宗教外衣、进行间谍活动的美国老牌特务华里柱的时候，虽然铁证如山，美国国务院和赫脱之流仍然无耻抵赖，把华里柱的间谍活动说成纯粹是“宗教使命”，说华里柱是美国的“无辜公民”，并反咬中国“迫害宗教”，和美帝国主义抵赖派遣间谍飞机侵犯苏联主权和破坏四国首脑会议的伎俩，都是一样的。
        加倍反击
    上海人民不仅熟悉美帝国主义恶狼的侵略本性，而且熟悉对付这头恶狼的办法。他们指出，对付美帝国主义的最好办法，就是加倍反击。
    曾经有一百多人奔赴抗美援朝前线的上海铁路办事处上海机务段职工，对这一点体会更深。这个机务段从党委书记、副段长、车间主任一直到司机、技工，都是当年朝鲜战场上钢铁运输线的英雄人物。他们亲自在朝鲜战场上跟美帝国主义较量过。22日，他们有三百多人举行集会支持苏联的严正立场，反对美帝国主义的侵略。
    这个机务段副车队长、曾经在抗美援朝斗争中立过三次功的司机江宏寿说，抗美援朝战争刚开始时，美帝国主义非常疯狂，日夜轰炸我们的运输线，许多线路、桥梁被炸断了，但是我们的运输线是打不断、炸不烂的钢铁运输线，敌人的飞机还常常被我们打得落花流水。几年前，美帝国主义在朝鲜就是我们的手下败将，现在我们更加强大了，社会主义阵营更强大了，如果它敢再来侵犯，就一定要叫它死无葬身之地。
    卢湾区的居民程秀英是个光荣妈妈，她有十个儿女，大儿子在上甘岭战役中光荣牺牲后，她又把另外两个儿子送去参军。这次她听到美国强盗竟敢侵犯苏联，她说，对敌人只能狠狠地打击，如果它要捣乱，就让它碰鼻撞墙。前几天，她给在炮兵部队的二儿子写了一封信，要他加倍提高警惕，保卫祖国的安全和世界和平。
    对美帝国主义的愤怒冲破了医院的宁静，上海市立第一人民医院七百多医务人员的集会上，曾到过朝鲜前线的唐孝均等五位医务人员向大家揭露了美帝国主义在朝鲜烧杀奸淫和进行细菌战的罪行。他们说：美帝国主义毕竟是纸老虎，在上甘岭倾泻下数不清的钢铁，但却不能前进一步。在中朝人民的坚决打击下，成批的美军士兵成了俘虏。如今，侵略成性的美帝国主义竟忘了在朝鲜受到的教训。我们热爱和平，但是决不向帝国主义乞求和平，抗美援朝的斗争告诉我们，只有坚决斗争，才能取得和平。唐孝均说：“我们警告帝国主义者：如果你们胆敢发动战争，我们一定要像消灭细菌一样消灭你们！”
        决不放松警惕
    阵容强大的民兵队伍，22日带着各种轻重武器，穿着整齐的服装，举着“民兵师”、“民兵团”的大旗，雄赳赳地参加了市中心的大会。在这支雄威的队伍里，有一位曾参加过举世闻名的上甘岭战役的志愿军复员军人、上海煤气公司民兵丘乾康。他激昂地说：“我们对侵略成性的美帝国主义，决不放松警惕。”中国人民解放军驻上海陆海空三军，在派出代表参加市中心大会的同时，广大官兵严守在各个战备岗位，在军舰上、飞机旁或炮位上收听大会广播实况。他们坚决响应萧华上将的号召，以高度的警惕，严密注视美帝国主义的战争阴谋。曾经在上海上空击落过美制蒋机的空军某部飞行员李永年说：“我们热爱和平，但决不害怕战争，侵略者如果要发动战争，我们将要打到它的老窝去，把它消灭干净！”
    解放前曾和美日侵略者斗争了一二十年的杨树浦发电厂职工们这几天连续举行了集会。美国飞机侵犯苏联的新罪行，使工人们又一次地想起了十年前2月6日美制蒋机轰炸上海犯下的滔天大罪。22日下午，许多在“二六”轰炸中受过伤和轰炸后抢修过工厂的老工人举行了集会。有四十一年工龄的老年工人张恒怀说：十年前，我们把美帝国主义赶出大陆，用我们的双手修复了被炸坏的工厂。十年来，我们又用自己的双手，把这个美帝国主义逃跑时说我们管不好的发电厂，管理得有条有理。十年后的今天，美帝国主义又在策划新的战争阴谋，我们一定要提高警惕，同它作坚决斗争。
    全世界人民团结起来，
      打倒美帝国主义！
    来自世界二十个国家的朋友们，22日参加了人民广场的集会。他们和上海人民一起，反对美帝国主义对苏联的侵略和挑衅。在人群的海洋中间，不同肤色的人们一起伸出愤怒的拳头，以不同的语言响亮地喊出一致的口号；世界爱好和平的人民在斗争中互相联结在一起。日本工会总评议会访华代表团副团长小森正夫指出：“美帝国主义这种侵犯苏联的间谍飞机，在日本的美国军事基地上同样也有，它的矛头是指向中国、苏联和其他社会主义国家的，这说明美帝国主义是我们的共同敌人。”
    来自战斗的非洲大陆的喀麦隆青年代表团团员费泽·保尔激动地说：“美帝国主义破坏了四国首脑会议，它是全世界人民最凶恶的敌人，它到处侵略，现在全世界人民都起来反对它，它的寿命不长了。”
    远渡重洋来到上海港的外国海员们，一登岸就纷纷表示自己对帝国主义战争挑衅的愤怒，许多人22日还参加了上海人民集会和示威的行列。第一次来到上海港的保加利亚“和平号”轮船的政治委员米旦夫，在登岸后和苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克以及中国的海员欢聚一起的时候，痛斥了美帝国主义的罪恶挑衅。捷克斯洛伐克海员查杰参加了上海人民的集会。他的母亲在第二次世界大战中曾被德国法西斯关进集中营，受尽折磨，最后由苏联红军解放出来。他说：“苏、捷人民在反法西斯斗争中结成了永远难忘的、战斗的友谊。美帝国主义对苏联的侵略，就是对捷克斯洛伐克的侵略，也是对整个社会主义阵营的侵略。我们决不允许！”
    上海人民22日反对美帝国主义的集会和示威，再次显示出中苏两国人民、社会主义各国人民、全世界爱好和平人民的紧密团结，这是天下无敌的力量。人民的力量一定能战胜帝国主义的战争势力，赢得世界的持久和平。
