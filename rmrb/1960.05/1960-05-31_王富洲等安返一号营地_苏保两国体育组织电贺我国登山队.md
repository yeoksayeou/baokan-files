Xinhua News Agency, Qomolangma, May 30th (by Xinhua reporter Guo Chaoren from the base camp of the Chinese mountaineering team at 5,120 meters above sea level on the slopes of Qomolangma): The heroes who victoriously conquered the world's highest peak, Qomolangma, have all safely returned to High Altitude Camp One, at 5,400 meters above sea level on the north slope of Qomolangma.

At 19:30, Beijing time, on the 29th, the reporter received news from High Altitude Camp One: Athlete Wang Fuzhou, athlete Qu Yinhua, and Class One athlete Gonbu, led by Xu Jing, the deputy captain of the Chinese mountaineering team and a mountaineering athlete, safely returned to High Altitude Camp One, at 5,400 meters above sea level, at 17:00 Beijing time that day. They will rest at this camp for one night and return to the mountaineering team's base camp at 5,120 meters above sea level at the foot of Qomolangma Mountain on the 30th.

After arriving at the camp at 5,400 meters above sea level, Xu Jing, at the request of a Xinhua News Agency reporter, delivered a short written statement on behalf of all the mountaineering team members. During the fourth high-altitude march, Xu Jing personally led the mountaineers to a place 8,500 meters above sea level on the north slope of Qomolangma, directly commanding the battle to capture the summit of Qomolangma, and achieved success.

In his speech, Xu Jing first thanked the Party and the people for their kind concern for the mountaineering team. He said: Under the correct leadership of the Party and with the strong support of the people of the whole country, the brave mountaineers fought tenaciously against the harsh nature of Qomolangma and achieved victory. Now, the three mountaineers who reached the summit are all in good condition and have safely returned to High Altitude Camp One.

Xu Jing said: Every one of our mountaineers clearly knows that the victory in conquering Qomolangma should be attributed to the great Party, the great socialist motherland, and the great 650 million people.

Finally, on behalf of all the mountaineers, Xu Jing said that they will certainly not be arrogant or impetuous, and will continue to work hard to plant the five-star red flag all over the peaks of the motherland as soon as possible, and contribute all their strength to the socialist construction of the motherland.

Xinhua News Agency, May 30th: The National Sports Commission of China has recently received telegrams from sports organizations, heads of sports organizations, and many athletes from the Soviet Union and Bulgaria, congratulating the Chinese mountaineering team on its great achievement in conquering the world's highest peak.

The Central Council of the Soviet Mountaineering Association said in its congratulatory telegram: We have learned with great joy of the great victory of Chinese mountaineers in climbing the world's highest peak, Qomolangma. We warmly congratulate them on establishing this great achievement.

Kolev, Chairman of the Bulgarian Sports Association, said in a telegram that the news of this historic victory of Chinese athletes filled them with joy. He also wished our athletes greater achievements under the glorious banner of the Communist Party.
