    Glorious Festival, Brilliant Achievements
    ——Celebrating the 15th Anniversary of the Liberation of Czechoslovakia
  　Liu Ningyi
    May 9th this year marks the 15th anniversary of the liberation of fraternal Czechoslovakia. For fifteen years, the hardworking and intelligent Czechoslovak people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, have achieved brilliant successes in the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction. Now, as Czechoslovakia celebrates the 15th anniversary of the liberation of their homeland, they are full of confidence and forging ahead to realize the grand program stipulated by the 11th Congress of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and to complete socialist construction in the shortest possible historical period. The Chinese people, together with the fraternal Czechoslovak people, celebrate this glorious festival with incomparable warmth and are elated by their brilliant achievements.
    Fifteen years ago, the heroic Soviet army finally swept away the German fascist invaders on Czechoslovak territory, and the Czechoslovak people finally obtained the liberation of their homeland and established a people's democratic regime under the leadership of the Communist Party. In February 1948, the Czechoslovak working class and all working people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, smashed the restoration plot of the bourgeois reactionaries and established the dictatorship of the proletariat in Czechoslovakia. In 1949, the Ninth Congress of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia formulated the general line of building socialism, and since then, the victorious march of socialist transformation and socialist construction has begun in an all-round way. The power of the working class has been consolidated day by day, the worker-peasant alliance has been continuously strengthened, and the Czech and Slovak brothers and sisters, as well as all ethnic groups in the country, have united more closely than ever before. The historically significant Eleventh Congress of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia in June 1958 declared that Czechoslovakia had virtually eliminated the exploitation of man by man and had basically built the foundation of socialism. The Congress formulated the grand program of "completing socialist construction," that is, building socialism and, on this basis, accumulating new strength and accumulating and creating new material and cultural wealth in order to transition to communism. The call of the Party and the infinitely beautiful prospects have aroused the even higher enthusiasm and labor enthusiasm of the people of Czechoslovakia for the struggle to realize this program.
    The hard work of the Czechoslovak working people over the past fifteen years has raised the national economy to an unprecedented height in Czechoslovak history, making Czechoslovakia one of the most highly developed industrial countries in the world. In 1959, Czechoslovak industrial production had grown to 3.5 times that of 1937. In the total value of industrial and agricultural output, the proportion of industry increased from 58% in 1937 to about 84%. At present, Czechoslovakia has exceeded, approached, or caught up with the most developed capitalist countries in terms of the average per capita output of major industrial products. For example, in 1959, the average per capita electricity production reached 1,610 kilowatt-hours, steel 448 kilograms, iron 309 kilograms, hard coal 1,948 kilograms, brown coal and peat 3,896 kilograms, and cement 345.5 kilograms. In the process of rapid industrial development, in order to adapt to the needs of the continued development of productive forces, a series of major reforms have been implemented in all links of the relations of production. In particular, the industrial reorganization and the reform of the planning and financial systems implemented in 1958 and 1959, as well as the reform of the workers' wage system that is about to be completed, have played a positive role in enhancing the enthusiasm of the working people and promoting the further upsurge of industrial production.
    The industrial development of the Slovak region is particularly rapid. Before liberation, due to historical development and the bourgeois great-nationalist policy, the economic and cultural level of the people in the Slovak region was very backward, and their lives were extremely poor. After the working class seized power, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, in accordance with the Leninist national policy, vigorously developed the industry in the Slovak region and achieved great success. Compared with 1937, industrial production in the Slovak region in 1959 increased by about 7.4 times, greatly exceeding the average development speed of the whole country. Slovakia has changed from a backward agricultural area to a developed industrial-agricultural area. The smooth realization of the industrialization of Slovakia has largely eliminated the historically inherited disparity in the level of economic development between the Czech and Slovak regions. This is the glorious victory of the national policy of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia.
    Czechoslovakia has a developed modern agriculture. The total value of agricultural production has been restored to the pre-war level, while agricultural labor productivity has greatly improved compared with pre-war. At present, agricultural cooperativization in Czechoslovakia has been basically completed. This provides good conditions for the development of large-scale socialist agriculture and the full utilization of the latest scientific and technological achievements in agriculture. In particular, recently, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia further pointed out that accelerating the development of agricultural production is the central task of current economic construction, and proposed to bring agriculture up to the level of industry within ten years, and mobilize the people of the whole country and the strength of industry, science and technology to guarantee its realization. Under the call of the Party, more than 10,000 cadres and agricultural technicians have actively gone to the countryside this year to strengthen the leadership of agricultural production in cooperatives and grassroots governments. Many agricultural production cooperatives across the country are merging into larger-scale cooperatives in accordance with the instructions of the Party, so as to further exert the superiority of large-scale socialist agricultural production. The labor competition movement in agriculture is also developing and deepening day by day. All this foreshadows that Czechoslovakia's agricultural production will achieve greater development.
    Hard work has brought a happy life to the Czechoslovak people. On the basis of production development, the material and cultural living standards of the people are constantly improving. In 1959, the wages of employees increased by more than 60% compared with 1948. Under the socialist system, the people's cultural and educational undertakings have also been fully developed, and the cultural life of the working people is very rich and colorful.
    The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia attaches importance to educating the people in the spirit of Marxism-Leninism, constantly improving the ideological consciousness and cultural level of the masses, cultivating new-type intellectuals of the working class, and transforming the old intellectuals. According to the resolution of the Eleventh Congress of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, Czechoslovakia has further strengthened the leadership of the Party on the ideological and cultural front and carried out a series of major tasks. After the Eleventh Congress of the Party, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia further emphasized the importance of ideological transformation of literary and art workers and the establishment of a Marxist-Leninist world outlook. The Socialist Culture Congress held in 1959 further united the broad masses of literary and art workers and guided them to better serve socialist construction and the working people. At present, a new and vigorous atmosphere has emerged on the socialist literary and art front in Czechoslovakia.
    While celebrating the 15th anniversary of the liberation of the motherland, the Czechoslovak people are accelerating their pace of progress with firm confidence. In order to promote the accelerated development of the national economy and further develop socialist democracy, a reorganization of the national administrative divisions of great significance is being implemented. At the same time, the powers and roles of the local people's committees at all levels in managing the people's economy and cultural life are further expanded. A new socialist constitution will be formulated this year; the third five-year plan (1961-1965) for the development of the national economy will also be officially adopted this year. This plan stipulates that industrial production should increase by at least 50% and agricultural production should increase by at least 21% in five years. These brilliant achievements of the socialist construction cause of Czechoslovakia over the past fifteen years are the result of the unity and heroic struggle of the Czechoslovak people under the leadership of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. At the same time, it is also inseparable from the great assistance of the Soviet Union and the mutual assistance and cooperation between socialist fraternal countries. At present, the people of Czechoslovakia are closely united around the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia headed by Comrade Novotny, full of enthusiasm and high morale to accelerate the construction of socialism.
    Czechoslovakia has always steadfastly adhered to the principle of proletarian internationalism and resolutely safeguarded the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the unity of international communist movement centered on the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Together with other fraternal parties, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia has made positive contributions to the struggle to safeguard the purity of Marxism-Leninism and oppose modern revisionism. Czechoslovakia has actively participated in and promoted close fraternal mutual assistance and cooperation among socialist camp countries. Czechoslovakia has always pursued a peaceful foreign policy, actively supported the various peace initiatives of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, opposed the imperialist policy of aggression and war, opposed the US imperialist revival of German militarism, and made great efforts to safeguard European security and world peace. Czechoslovakia has always supported the struggle of the people of Asia, Africa and Latin America against imperialism and colonialism and for national independence, and actively developed economic cooperation relations with the nationally independent countries in these regions on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, helping these countries to develop their own national economies. In various international institutions and organizations, the representatives of Czechoslovakia have also made unremitting efforts for the noble cause of world peace and human progress.
    Although China and Czechoslovakia are geographically far apart, there is a deep friendship between the two peoples. Over the past ten years, the relations of unity, friendship, mutual assistance and cooperation between the two countries have been fully and greatly developed. This new type of international relation established in accordance with the principle of proletarian internationalism has powerfully promoted the socialist cause of the two countries. The conclusion of the Sino-Czechoslovak Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation in 1957 advanced the fraternal relations of mutual assistance and cooperation between the two countries to a new stage. Over the past ten years, mutual visits of party and government leaders and various delegations of the two countries have greatly deepened mutual understanding and friendship. Our two countries have always closely cooperated and supported each other in the international struggle. Czechoslovakia has always supported our country's struggle to liberate Taiwan, opposed the US imperialist aggression against our country and the conspiracy to create "two Chinas". Similarly, our people have always resolutely supported the Czechoslovak people's struggle against West German militarism and revanchism and for safeguarding European security.
    China and Czechoslovakia have carried out fruitful economic cooperation. This fraternal cooperation plays a positive role in promoting the development of socialist economic construction and the improvement of the people's living standards in both countries. Trade between the two countries has continued to develop, and the trade volume in 1959 has increased to seven and a half times that of 1950. Over the past ten years, Czechoslovakia has provided important support for our country's economic construction with first-class quality complete sets of equipment and various machines, as well as sending excellent experts and technicians. The Chinese people are deeply grateful for this fraternal assistance. At the same time, our country has also supported Czechoslovakia's economic construction with many important industrial raw materials and necessary materials. Great progress has also been made in scientific and technological cooperation between the two countries. Since the signing of the Sino-Czechoslovak Scientific and Technological Cooperation Agreement in 1952, the two countries have exchanged information or sent experts and study groups on many scientific and technological cooperation projects of great significance to the national economy. Economic and cultural cooperation and exchanges between the two countries have greatly deepened mutual understanding and fraternal friendship between the two peoples, and have also enabled us to learn a lot of useful experience and knowledge from each other.
    China and Czechoslovakia are both members of the big family of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. We have the common ideology of Marxism-Leninism and the great goal of building socialism and communism. Our friendly unity is inseparable by any force. The Chinese people have always regarded the struggle of the Czechoslovak people as their own struggle and their achievements as their own achievements. Now, as Czechoslovakia celebrates the 15th anniversary of the liberation of the whole country, the Chinese people, with the same excitement and enthusiasm, hail the great victories achieved by the fraternal Czechoslovak people over the past fifteen years, and wish them new and greater achievements in the great cause of building socialism and in the noble cause of safeguarding world peace and promoting human progress!

    光荣的节日　辉煌的成就
    ——庆祝捷克斯洛伐克解放十五周年
  　刘宁一
    今年5月9日是兄弟的捷克斯洛伐克解放十五周年。十五年来，勤劳智慧的捷克斯洛伐克人民，在捷克斯洛伐克共产党的领导下，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业中取得了辉煌的成就。现在，当捷克斯洛伐克举国欢庆祖国解放十五周年的时候，他们正满怀信心地为实现捷共第十一次代表大会规定的宏伟纲领，为在一个最短的历史时期内完成社会主义建设而奋勇前进。中国人民和兄弟的捷克斯洛伐克人民一道，以无比热烈的心情欢庆这个光辉的节日，并为他们所取得的辉煌成就而欢欣鼓舞。
    十五年前，英勇的苏军最后扫荡了捷克斯洛伐克国土上的德国法西斯侵略者，捷克斯洛伐克人民终于获得了祖国的解放，建立了在共产党领导下的人民民主政权。1948年2月，捷克斯洛伐克工人阶级和全体劳动人民，又在捷共的领导下，粉碎了资产阶级反动派的复辟阴谋，在捷克斯洛伐克确立了无产阶级专政。1949年，捷共第九次代表大会制定了建设社会主义的总路线，从此全面开始了社会主义改造和社会主义建设的胜利进军。工人阶级政权日益巩固，工农联盟不断加强，捷克、斯洛伐克两个兄弟民族以及全国各族人民空前地紧密团结。1958年6月具有历史意义的捷共第十一次代表大会宣告，捷克斯洛伐克实际上已消灭了人对人的剥削，基本上建成了社会主义的基础。大会制订了“完成社会主义建设”的宏伟纲领，即：建成社会主义，并在此基础上积蓄新的力量、积累和创造新的物质和文化财富，以便向共产主义过渡。党的号召和无限美好的前景，激起了捷克斯洛伐克全国人民更加高涨的积极性和劳动热情，为实现这个纲领而斗争。
    捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民十五年来的辛勤努力，已经把国民经济提到捷克斯洛伐克历史上空前未有的高度，使捷克斯洛伐克成为世界上高度发达的工业国之一。1959年，捷克斯洛伐克工业生产已增长为1937年的三点五倍。在工农业总产值中，工业所占的比重由1937年的58％增为84％左右。目前，捷克斯洛伐克在主要工业产品按人口平均计算的产量方面，有的已超过、有的已接近或赶上最发达的资本主义国家。例如，按人口平均计算，1959年电力生产已达到一千六百一十度、钢四百四十八公斤、铁三百零九公斤、硬煤一千九百四十八公斤、褐煤和泥炭三千八百九十六公斤、水泥三百四十五点五公斤。在工业迅速发展的过程中，为了适应生产力继续发展的需要，在生产关系的各个环节上先后实行了一系列重大的改革。其中特别是1958年、1959年实行的工业改组和计划、财务制度的改革以及即将完成的工人工资制度的改革，对提高劳动人民的积极性、促进工业生产的进一步高涨，起了良好的作用。
    斯洛伐克地区工业的发展尤为迅速。解放前，由于历史发展和资产阶级大民族主义政策的结果，斯洛伐克地区人民的经济、文化水平十分落后，生活异常贫困。工人阶级掌握政权以后，捷共根据列宁主义的民族政策，大力发展了斯洛伐克地区的工业，取得了很大的成就。1959年与1937年比较，斯洛伐克地区的工业生产增长了约七点四倍，大大超过了全国平均的发展速度。斯洛伐克已由一个落后的农业地区变成为一个发达的工业—农业地区。斯洛伐克工业化的顺利实现，在很大程度上消除了历史上遗留下来的捷克、斯洛伐克两地区经济发展水平相差悬殊的状况。这是捷共民族政策的光辉胜利。
    捷克斯洛伐克有着发达的现代农业。农业生产总值业已恢复到战前水平，而农业劳动生产率则较战前有很大提高。现在，捷克斯洛伐克农业合作化已基本上完成。这就为发展社会主义的农业大生产、在农业中充分利用最新科学技术成就提供了良好条件。特别是最近以来，捷共进一步指出，加速发展农业生产乃是当前经济建设的中心任务，提出了要在十年内使农业赶上工业水平，并动员全国人民和工业、科学、技术等各方面的力量来保证其实现。在党的号召下，今年以来已有一万多名干部和农业技术人员踊跃下乡，加强合作社和基层政权对农业生产的领导。全国许多农业生产合作社正根据党的指示合并成规模较大的合作社，以便进一步发挥社会主义农业大生产的优越性。农业中的劳动竞赛运动也正在日益开展和深入。这一切都预示着捷克斯洛伐克的农业生产将取得更大的发展。
    辛勤的劳动为捷克斯洛伐克人民带来了幸福的生活。在生产发展的基础上，人民的物质、文化生活水平不断提高。1959年职工的工资比1948年提高了60％以上。在社会主义制度下，人民的文化教育事业也有了全面的发展，劳动人民的文化生活也十分丰富多彩。
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党重视以马克思列宁主义精神教育人民，不断提高人民群众的思想觉悟和文化水平，培养工人阶级的新型知识分子，改造旧知识分子。根据捷共第十一次代表大会的决议，捷克斯洛伐克在思想文化战线上进一步加强了党的领导，开展了一系列重大工作。捷共在党的第十一次代表大会以后，进一步强调了文艺工作者进行思想改造、树立马克思列宁主义世界观的重要意义。1959年举行的社会主义文化代表大会，进一步团结了广大文艺工作者，并引导他们更好地为社会主义建设和劳动人民服务。目前，在捷克斯洛伐克社会主义文艺战线上已出现了蓬勃高涨的新气象。
    在欢庆祖国解放十五周年的时候，捷克斯洛伐克人民正怀着坚强的信心，加速着自己的前进步伐。为了促进国民经济的加速发展，进一步发扬社会主义民主，正在实行具有重大意义的全国行政区划的改组。同时进一步扩大各级地方人民委员会在管理人民经济和文化生活方面的职权和作用。一部新的社会主义的宪法将在今年制定；发展国民经济的第三个五年计划（1961—1965年）也将在今年正式通过。这一计划规定，五年间工业生产至少要增长50％，农业生产至少要增长21％。捷克斯洛伐克社会主义建设事业十五年来取得的这些辉煌成就，是捷克斯洛伐克人民在捷共领导下团结一致、英勇奋斗的结果。同时它也是和苏联巨大的援助以及社会主义兄弟国家之间的互助合作分不开的。现在，捷克斯洛伐克全国人民，正紧密团结在以诺沃提尼同志为首的捷共中央的周围，热情充沛、斗志昂扬地加速建设社会主义。
    捷克斯洛伐克一贯坚定不移地遵循着无产阶级国际主义原则，坚决维护以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结和以苏共为中心的国际共产主义运动的团结。捷共和其他兄弟党一起，在维护马克思列宁主义的纯洁性、反对现代修正主义的斗争中作出了积极的贡献。捷克斯洛伐克积极参与并促进了社会主义阵营各国间密切的兄弟般的互助合作。捷克斯洛伐克一贯奉行和平外交政策，积极支持苏联及其他兄弟国家的各项和平倡议，反对帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，反对美帝国主义复活德国军国主义，为维护欧洲安全和世界和平进行着巨大的努力。捷克斯洛伐克一向支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民反对帝国主义、殖民主义，争取和维护民族独立的斗争，并且在平等互利的基础上同这些地区的民族独立国家积极开展经济合作关系，帮助这些国家发展自己的民族经济。在各种国际机构和组织中，捷克斯洛伐克的代表也一贯为世界和平和人类进步的崇高事业进行了不懈的努力。
    中捷两国虽然地理上相距遥远，但两国人民之间却存在着深厚的友谊。十年来，两国之间的团结友好、互助合作关系得到了全面的巨大发展。这种根据无产阶级国际主义原则建立起来的新型的国际关系，有力地推动了两国社会主义事业的向前迈进。1957年中捷友好合作条约的缔结，把两国团结互助的兄弟关系推进到一个新的阶段。十年来，两国党政领导人以及各种代表团的相互访问，大大加深了彼此间的了解和友谊。我们两国在国际斗争中一向紧密合作，互相支持。捷克斯洛伐克一贯支持我国解放台湾的斗争，反对美帝国主义对我国的侵略和制造“两个中国”的阴谋。同样，我国人民对捷克斯洛伐克人民反对西德军国主义、复仇主义和维护欧洲安全的斗争也一贯作了坚决的支持。
    中捷两国之间进行了成效卓著的经济合作。这种兄弟般的合作对两国社会主义经济建设的发展和人民生活水平的提高起着积极的促进作用。两国间的贸易不断发展，到1959年贸易额已增为1950年的七倍半。十年来，捷克斯洛伐克以头等质量的成套设备和各种机器以及派遣优秀的专家和技术人员，为我国经济建设提供了重要的支援。中国人民对于这种兄弟般的援助深为感谢。同时，我国也以许多重要的工业原料和必需的物资支援了捷克斯洛伐克的经济建设。两国间的科技合作也取得了巨大进展。自从1952年签订中捷科技合作协定以来，两国已对国民经济具有重要意义的许多科技合作项目交换了资料或派遣了专家和考察团。两国间的在经济和文化方面的合作和交往，大大加深了两国人民间的相互了解和兄弟友谊，同时也使我们相互学习了不少有益的经验和知识。
    中捷两国都是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营大家庭中的一员。我们有着马克思列宁主义的共同思想和建设社会主义和共产主义的伟大目标，我们之间的友好团结是任何力量也分不开的。中国人民一向把捷克斯洛伐克人民的斗争当作自己的斗争，把他们的成就当作自己的成就。现在，当捷克斯洛伐克万民欢庆解放十五周年的时候，中国人民以同样兴奋热烈的心情，欢呼兄弟的捷克斯洛伐克人民十五年来取得的伟大胜利，并预祝他们在建设社会主义的伟大事业中，在维护世界和平、促进人类进步的崇高事业中取得新的、更大的成就！
