Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 15th: The Shanghai People's Congress in Support of the Japanese People's Struggle Against the U.S.-Japan Military Alliance Treaty, held on May 15th, unanimously passed a telegram to the Osaka City Security Struggle and Osaka Prefectural People's Conference, supporting the just struggle of the people of Osaka City against the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty.

The telegram stated: "Today, more than 1.7 million people from all walks of life in Shanghai are holding a massive rally and demonstration, resolutely supporting the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle against the U.S.-Japan Military Alliance Treaty! We extend our warm and high respect to the heroic, tenacious, and unyielding spirit shown by the Japanese people in their struggle!

"The most ferocious U.S. imperialism in the world, colluding with its running dog, the Nobusuke Kishi traitorous clique, in its criminal activities of turning Japan into a source of aggressive war in Asia, poses a serious threat to all peace-loving countries and peoples in Asia and the world, and marks the beginning of a new and enormous disaster for the Japanese people. The Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan Military Alliance Treaty is a historically significant struggle concerning the fate of the Japanese nation, and is a struggle to defend peace in Asia and the world. Only by resolutely smashing the U.S.-Japan Military Alliance Treaty, abolishing U.S. military bases in Japan, driving U.S. imperialism out of Japan, and thoroughly crushing the criminal plan of U.S. imperialism and Japanese reactionaries to collude in launching aggressive wars, so that Japan can embark on the path of independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality, can the Japanese people avoid falling into the abyss of war again!

"The signing of the U.S.-Japan Military Alliance Treaty, the revival of Japanese militarism, the recent series of war clamors by the Nobusuke Kishi reactionary clique, and the U.S. planes using Japanese bases to conduct high-altitude espionage activities against China and the Soviet Union, once again demonstrate that the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries are actively preparing an aggression plan targeting China, the Soviet Union, and Asian countries. We solemnly warn the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries: the times are different now, and the days when imperialism could do whatever it wanted are gone forever. If U.S. imperialism and Japanese reactionaries, disregarding the opposition of the Chinese people, the Japanese people, and the people of the world, embark on the old path of launching aggressive wars like Hitler and Hideki Tojo, their end will only be more tragic than the failures of Hitler and Hideki Tojo!

"The Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle against the U.S.-Japan Military Alliance Treaty is not isolated. The just struggles of the people of all countries in the world support each other. All peace-loving and justice-upholding people in the world stand on the side of the Japanese people. U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the Chinese and Japanese people, and is also the most ferocious enemy of the people of the world. The Chinese people have always regarded supporting the Japanese people's patriotic and just anti-U.S. struggle as their sacred duty. The Japanese people have great hope, and their future is bright. We firmly believe that the heroic and unyielding Japanese people, with the support of the people of the world, will further strengthen their unity, persevere, and fight to the end, and will surely be able to smash the U.S.-Japan Military Alliance Treaty and drive U.S. imperialism out of Japan! It is definitely not the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries who decide Japan's fate, but the more than 90 million Japanese people!

"Let the Chinese and Japanese people unite, let the people of the world unite, and defeat U.S. imperialism!"

    决定日本命运的是战斗的日本人民
    上海十五日大会致大阪市安保共斗大阪府民会议的通电
    新华社上海15日电　在15日举行的上海各界人民支援日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约大会，一致通过了致日本大阪市安保共斗大阪府民会议的通电，支持大阪市人民反对日美安全条约的正义斗争。
    通电说：“今天，上海各界一百七十多万人民，举行声势浩大的集会和示威游行，坚决支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的反美爱国正义斗争！我们对日本人民在斗争中所表现的英勇顽强、不屈不挠的英雄气概，致以热烈的崇高的敬意！
    “世界上最凶暴的美帝国主义，同它的走狗岸信介卖国集团相互勾结，把日本变为亚洲的侵略战争策源地的罪恶活动，对于亚洲和全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民是严重的威胁，对于日本人民是一场新的巨大灾难的开始。日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争，是一场关系到日本民族命运的具有历史意义的斗争，是保卫亚洲和世界和平的斗争。日本人民只有坚决粉碎日美军事同盟条约，取消美国在日本的军事基地，把美帝国主义赶出日本去，彻底粉碎美帝国主义和日本反动派相互勾结进行侵略战争的罪恶计划，使日本走上独立、民主、和平、中立的道路，日本人民才能避免又一次陷入战争的灾难深渊！
    “日美军事同盟条约的签订，日本军国主义的复活，岸信介反动集团最近一系列的战争叫嚣，以及美国飞机利用日本基地对中苏两国进行高空间谍活动，再一次表明美日反动派正在积极准备着以中国、苏联和亚洲各国为对象的侵略计划。我们严正警告美、日反动派：现在时代已经不同了，帝国主义为所欲为的日子已经一去不复返了。如果美帝国主义和日本反动派不顾中国人民、日本人民和全世界人民的反对，走上希特勒、东条英机发动侵略战争的老路，那么它的结局只会比希特勒、东条英机失败得更加悲惨！
    “日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的反美爱国正义斗争不是孤立的。全世界各国人民的正义斗争都是互相支持的。全世界爱好和平和主持正义的人民，都站在日本人民一边，美帝国主义是中日两国人民的共同敌人，也是全世界人民共同的最凶恶的敌人。中国人民一向把支持日本人民的反美爱国正义斗争当作是自己的神圣的义务。日本人民是很有希望的，前途是光明的。我们深信，英勇不屈的日本人民在全世界人民的支持下，进一步加强团结，再接再厉，斗争到底，一定能够粉碎日美军事同盟条约，一定能够把美帝国主义从日本赶出去！决定日本命运的绝不是美日反动派，而是九千多万日本人民！
    “中日两国人民团结起来，全世界人民团结起来，打倒美帝国主义！”
