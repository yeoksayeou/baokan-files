Xinhua News Agency, Ankara, May 30th: The Turkish military government dispatched a large number of troops on May 29th to prevent citizens of Ankara, the Turkish capital, from holding demonstrations.

It is reported that after more than 20,000 people held demonstrations in Ankara on the 28th to celebrate the collapse of the Menderes fascist regime, the newly appointed martial law commander of the Turkish capital issued another order prohibiting all gatherings and demonstrations. However, the masses, who deeply hated the Menderes traitorous government, disregarded the military government's ban and gathered again in the center of Ankara on the 29th, preparing to hold a demonstration. The Turkish authorities sent truckloads of soldiers to guard all intersections in the city, preventing the demonstration. However, a large number of people still broke through the cordon and stormed the residence of Menderes's right-hand man, former Speaker of the National Assembly Koraltan, and destroyed the furniture.

According to Agence France-Presse, the Minister of Education of the military government, in an attempt to "restore calm" to Turkish university students and prevent them from demonstrating, is about to announce a decision to hold examinations in universities across the country on June 9th. The Agence France-Presse report also said: "With the restoration of calm, the bourgeoisie of Ankara feels much more comfortable. They were uneasy about the mass demonstrations, which seemed to be beyond the control of the army."

According to Western news agencies, Turkish officials have confirmed that the Minister of the Interior of the Menderes cabinet committed suicide by jumping from a building, fearing the people's punishment. Menderes and former President Bayar and others were sent to Yassıada Island after his suicide. The chairman of the Turkish State Bank under the Menderes regime was arrested on a ship in the port of Istanbul. $60,000 was found on him. The wife of Menderes's Foreign Minister Zorlu (who was carrying jewelry worth hundreds of thousands of dollars) was also arrested at the same time.

It is reported that the United States, Britain, and West Germany have recognized the Turkish military government, and Pakistan and Iran, members of the CENTO military aggression bloc, have also officially recognized this government.

    示威者突破封锁线冲进前议长的住宅
    新华社30日讯　安卡拉消息：土耳其军政府29日出动了大批军队阻止土耳其首都安卡拉市民举行示威。
    据报道，在28日两万多群众在安卡拉举行示威、庆祝曼德列斯法西斯政权的垮台之后，新任命的土耳其首都戒严司令就再一次发布命令，禁止一切集会和示威游行。但是，恨透曼德列斯卖国政府的群众不顾军政府的禁令在29日在安卡拉市中心再一次集合，准备举行示威游行。土耳其当局派了成卡车的士兵驻守在全市所有的交叉路口，阻止了这次示威。但是，仍然有大批群众突破警戒线，冲进了曼德列斯的得力助手、前国民议会议长科拉尔的住宅，并捣毁了家具。
    据法新社报道，军政府的教育部长为了企图使土耳其的大学生“恢复平静”、不再出来示威游行，即将宣布全国各大学在6月9日举行考试的决定。法新社的报道又说：“由于恢复了平静，安卡拉的资产阶级人士感到舒服多了。他们曾经对群众的示威感到不安，这些示威大有被军队控制不住之势。”
    据西方通讯社报道，土耳其官方已证实，曼德列斯内阁的内政部长因为害怕人民对他的惩罚已跳楼自死。曼德列斯和前总统拜亚尔等人就是在他自杀后被送往雅西亚达岛上的。在曼德列斯政权下担任土耳其国家银行的董事长在伊斯坦布尔港口的一艘轮船上被逮捕。在他身上搜出了六万美元。曼德列斯内阁的外交部长佐鲁的妻子（她携带着价值几十万美元的珠宝）也同时被捕。
    据报道，美国、英国和西德已经承认了土耳其军政府，军事侵略集团中央条约组织成员国的巴基斯坦和伊朗也已正式承认这个政府。
