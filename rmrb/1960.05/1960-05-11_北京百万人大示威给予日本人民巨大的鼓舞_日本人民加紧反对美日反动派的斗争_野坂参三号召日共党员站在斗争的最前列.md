    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 10th: Japanese Communist Party Chairman Nosaka Sanzō recently delivered a speech in Nagoya titled "Revising the Security Treaty and Japan's Destiny," calling on all JCP members to stand at the forefront of the struggle, organize strike struggles of the Japanese working class, and continue to fight to prevent the conspiracy of the Diet to ratify the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

    Nosaka delivered the speech at a general mobilization meeting of members of the Japanese Communist Party Aichi Prefecture Committee on the 6th, held to prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty." More than 4,000 party members and family members from Nagoya and neighboring cities and villages attended the meeting.

    Nosaka Sanzō pointed out at the meeting that revising the "Security Treaty" would make Japan, along with West Germany, bear part of the task of the U.S.'s war provocation conspiracy, and it is also a dangerous conspiracy to establish a new anti-communist axis. Preventing this conspiracy from succeeding is not only a matter for the Japanese people themselves, but also an obligation that the Japanese people should undertake to the people of the world.

    The meeting unanimously passed a resolution firmly stating that they would fight to the end to prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty," overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, and dissolve the Diet.

    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 10th: The million-strong demonstration held in Beijing on the 9th in support of the Japanese people's struggle has greatly encouraged the Japanese people. Mizuguchi Hirozo, the leader of the "National Conference to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty," which is composed of more than 140 national organizations in Japan, said today that with the strong support of Chinese friends, the Japanese people will intensify their struggle against the common enemies of the Japanese and Chinese people – U.S. imperialism and the Kishi Nobusuke clique.

    Currently, the sixteenth unified action of the Japanese people against the ratification of the new "Security Treaty" is deepening and a new climax is brewing.

    More than 2,000 joint struggle organizations against the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" throughout Japan began a signature campaign on the streets and through door-to-door visits on the 8th of this month, demanding that the Diet not ratify the new "Security Treaty," and passing resolutions of no confidence in the Kishi Nobusuke government and dissolution of the Diet.

    The Tokyo Metropolitan Committee of the Communist Party passed a resolution on the 7th, requesting all party members to mobilize workers in all workshops to actively discuss and prepare for political strikes.

    At the same time, the Japanese Communist Party has decided to hold a mass rally on May 15 to oppose the Diet's ratification of the new "Security Treaty" and demand the dissolution of the Diet, and to support the struggle of the South Korean people.

    The "Security Treaty Criticism Association," composed of cultural figures, is conducting an in-depth propaganda campaign throughout Tokyo. On the 7th and 8th of this month, thirty well-known leaders in the cultural field rode in two broadcasting trucks in Tokyo, calling on citizens to participate in the planned petition to the Diet. In addition to participating in the movement to petition the Diet initiated by the "National Conference to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty" on May 14, members of the Criticism Association also plan to petition the Diet separately on the 17th.

    The All-Japan Federation of Student Self-Government Associations has decided to mobilize all young people and students to participate firmly and unitedly in the national unified action.

    The Gunma Prefecture Democratic Defense League has announced an emergency mobilization. It is scheduled to hold mass rallies in seventeen locations in the county on the evening of the 12th, and recommends that all trade unions in the county also hold strikes and rallies on the 12th. It also recommends that stores participating in the Democratic Business and Industry Federation and stores supporting the struggle against the "Security Treaty" hold a market strike.

    The Gunma Prefecture Democratic Defense League has also decided to dispatch a total of 2,000 representatives to Tokyo between the 12th and the 26th to directly petition the Diet against the ratification of the new "Security Treaty."

    The people of Kanagawa Prefecture have also decided to hold mass rallies on the 12th to oppose the Diet's ratification of the new "Security Treaty." The mass rallies will also oppose the use of the Atsugi Air Base in this county by U.S. U2 aircraft.

    In addition, in Hyogo Prefecture, the Anti-"Security Treaty" Conference issued an emergency mobilization statement and is preparing to bring the movement against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" to a climax on the 12th.
