Actively Implement the Mass Line Policy of Democratic Management
Qingping Commune Canteen Skillfully Cooks Food for Thousands of Families
The commune members praised: The canteen staff is busy day and night, getting up early and going to bed late to run the canteen. To ensure that the masses eat well, they try every means and method. The hot food and fragrant dishes are praised by everyone, and the attentive attitude is spread throughout the neighborhood. The good style of "I for everyone" radiates the glory of communism!

(This newspaper report) Guangzhou City Qingping People’s Commune canteens, actively implementing the mass line policy of democratic management, have made the canteens better and better, and are welcomed by the masses. According to statistics, the number of people eating in the canteen in early May increased by about 50% compared with early April.

The democratic management methods of the Qingping People's Commune public canteens include three basic contents: First, hold regular mass representative meetings to discuss and approve the canteen's work report for each period, and decide on major issues related to the canteen's management and development; second, elect a democratic management committee composed mainly of mass representatives, with canteen staff and cadres participating, at the mass representative meeting. After the representative meeting is adjourned, the management committee exercises the powers of the representative meeting, regularly or temporarily discusses matters related to improving the work of the canteen, and frequently listens to and reflects the opinions of the masses to help the canteen improve its work. The committee also conducts regular inspections and supervision of the canteen's financial income and expenditure; third, set up a mass airing, venting, rectification garden or suggestion box (book) to directly listen to criticisms and suggestions from the masses.

After the Qingping People's Commune public canteens implemented the above methods, the masses' "being masters of their own affairs" thinking was greatly brought into play, changing the past phenomenon of relying only on a few employees to run the canteens. For example, when the canteens of the first and fifth neighborhood committees of Qingping Street held their first mass representative meetings, the representatives actively put forward a total of 144 commendations, criticisms, and suggestions, including those related to business management, service attitude, food variety and quality, and cleanliness and hygiene. These opinions played a significant role in improving the work of the canteen. Mai Ganting, who was elected as the deputy director of the Democratic Management Committee of the canteen of the First Neighborhood Committee of Qingping Street by the masses, although very old, always takes some time every day to help the canteen improve its work, and carefully audits the canteen's financial income and expenditure, so that the canteen's accounts are clear. Some people in the canteen of the Third Neighborhood Committee of the First Management District, in order to help the canteen do a good job in sanitation, often voluntarily go to the canteen to carry out cleaning, washing tables and chairs, and pouring coal ash, which greatly improved the sanitation work of this canteen. Sometimes, when the cooks are sick, the masses automatically go to help the canteen cook and wash vegetables to ensure that the meals are supplied on time.

The implementation of the democratic management system has enabled the canteen staff to further realize the importance of running the canteen well, and to do everything possible to improve the quality of service. In order to enable the masses to eat their fill, eat well, eat economically, and eat conveniently, they actively rely on the help of the catering industry, and strive to improve their cooking skills and increase the variety of dishes. In the past, each canteen only had three or four kinds of dishes every day, but now it has generally increased to about ten kinds, and some have more than ten kinds. They have also rationally adjusted the labor organization, increased the number of food supply points, and advanced and extended the supply time to facilitate the masses as much as possible. In addition, they have also established and improved various management systems, especially attendance, finance, hygiene, storage, and acceptance systems, so that the work is gradually institutionalized and organized. The canteen of the First Neighborhood Committee of Qingping Street was originally a third-class canteen. Since the implementation of democratic management and the resolute adoption of the above measures, the work has taken on a new look and has begun to embark on a sound development path, becoming an advanced canteen. The commune members posted a big-character poster to praise this new atmosphere: The canteen staff is busy day and night, getting up early and going to bed late to run the canteen. To ensure that the masses eat well, they try every means and method. The hot food and fragrant dishes are praised by everyone, and the attentive attitude is spread throughout the neighborhood. The good style of "I for everyone" radiates the glory of communism!

    积极贯彻民主管理的群众路线方针
    清平公社食堂巧煮千家饭
    社员歌颂道：食堂职工日夜忙，早起晚睡办食堂。为了群众吃得好，想尽百计与千方。饭热菜香人称赞，态度殷勤传里巷。我为人人好风格，共产主义放豪光！
    本报讯　广州市清平人民公社各食堂，积极贯彻民主管理的群众路线方针，使食堂越办越好，受到群众欢迎。据统计，5月上旬到食堂吃饭的人数，比4月上旬增加了50％左右。
    清平人民公社公共食堂的民主管理方法，包括三个基本内容：一，定期举行群众代表会议，讨论和通过食堂每一时期的工作报告，决定食堂管理和发展的有关重大问题；二，在群众代表会议上，选举产生一个以群众代表为主、有食堂职工和干部参加的民主管理委员会。管理委员会在代表会议闭幕后，执行代表会议的职权，定期或临时讨论有关改进食堂工作事宜，并经常听取和反映群众的意见，帮助食堂改进工作。对食堂的财务收支情况，委员会也随时进行检查监督；三、设立群众鸣放整改园地或意见箱（簿），直接听取群众的批评和建议。
    清平人民公社各公共食堂实行上述办法后，大大发挥了群众“当家作主”的思想，改变了过去只依靠少数职工办食堂的现象。例如，清平街第一、五两个居民委员会的食堂，在召开第一次群众代表会议时，代表们就积极提出包括有关经营管理、服务态度、饭菜花色品种和质量、清洁卫生等方面的表扬、批评和建议意见共一百四十四条。这些意见对食堂工作的改进，起了很大作用。被群众选为清平街第一居民委员会食堂民主管理委员会副主任的麦干廷，虽然年纪很大，但每天总要抽出一部分时间，帮助食堂改进工作，并细心审核食堂的财务收支情况，使这个食堂的账目做到一清二楚。第一管理区第三居民委员会食堂有些群众，为了帮助食堂做好卫生工作，也经常自愿到食堂进行大扫除，洗桌椅、倒煤灰，使这个食堂的卫生工作大大改进。有时，炊事员病了，群众就自动去帮助食堂煮饭，洗菜，保证饭菜按时供应。
    民主管理制的推行，使食堂职工进一步认识到办好食堂的重要意义，千方百计地提高服务质量。为了使群众吃得饱，吃得好，吃得省和吃得方便，他们积极依靠饮食行业的帮助，努力提高烹调技术，增加花色品种。过去，各个食堂每天只有三几种菜，现在普遍增加到十种左右，有的在十种以上。他们还合理调整了劳动组织，增加饭菜供应点，并提早、延长供应时间，尽量方便群众。另外，他们还建立和健全了各种管理制度，特别是考勤、财务、卫生、保管、验收等制度，使工作逐步做到制度化、条理化。清平街第一居民委员会的食堂原是三类食堂，自从实行民主管理并坚决采取上述措施后，工作气象一新，开始走上健全发展的轨道，成为一个先进的食堂。社员贴了一张大字报，来歌颂这个新气象：食堂职工日夜忙，早起晚睡办食堂。为了群众吃得好，想尽百计与千方。饭热菜香人称赞，态度殷勤传里巷。我为人人好风格，共产主义放豪光！
