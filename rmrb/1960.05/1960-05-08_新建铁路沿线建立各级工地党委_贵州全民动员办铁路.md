    Party Committees Established at All Levels on Newly Built Railways
    Guizhou Mobilizes the Entire Population to Build Railways

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang: Guizhou Province, in the construction of the Xiangqian and Dianqian Railways, has established Party committees at all levels at the construction sites, further strengthening the Party's leadership and better implementing the policy of the whole Party and the entire population building railways.

    The construction site Party committee is composed of the first secretaries of the prefectural (autonomous prefecture) Party committees in the main construction areas of these two railways, who serve as the secretaries of the construction site Party committees. It also includes responsible persons from the Railway Bureau, the Railway Corps, and the prefectural (autonomous prefecture) and county (city) Party committee responsible persons along the railway line as its main members. The Party secretaries of each engineering office and brigade (or Railway Corps regiment and battalion) participate in the Party committees of the counties and people's communes where they are located; conversely, the Party secretaries of the counties and communes participate in the Party committees of the engineering offices and brigades. Under the direct leadership of the Guizhou Provincial Party Committee, the tasks of the construction site Party committee are to lead the political and ideological work in railway construction, engineering arrangements, labor force allocation, supply of living materials, and organization of coordination between regions and departments.

    The construction site Party committee was established to meet the requirements of heavy railway construction tasks and short construction periods this year. After the establishment of the construction site Party committees for the Dianqian and Xiangqian Railways, political and ideological work was carried out thoroughly, and all tasks proceeded rapidly and smoothly in a unified manner. After the determination to build the two railways, each county, under the unified leadership and command of the railway line construction site Party committee, with the county Party secretary taking the lead and the commune uniformly allocating labor, concentrated more than 90,000 migrant workers to participate in road construction within more than a month. In order to do a good job in leading and educating the migrant workers, Party committees at all levels were equipped with strong cadres. Among the more than 90,000 migrant workers, nearly 100 county-level cadres, hundreds of district-level cadres, and a large number of Party members and Youth League activists were assigned. In addition, to meet the needs of road construction, each county also assigned a certain number of skilled workers. When the migrant workers arrived at the railway construction site, they were all full of enthusiasm and drive.

    Another effect of establishing the construction site Party committees for the Dianqian and Xiangqian Railways is that the construction preparation work was done quickly and well. Because the construction site Party committee made overall arrangements for manpower, materials, and financial resources, the work that used to take a long time to complete can now be completed in a very short time. For example, to solve the accommodation problem for railway workers and migrant workers, the people along the line, under the leadership of the construction site Party committee, adopted a crash approach and built more than 140,000 square meters of simple sheds in ten days. With the addition of more than 200,000 square meters of private houses adjusted and vacated by the communes, the accommodation problem was basically solved.

    In addition, the solidarity and cooperation between workers and peasants along the line has been strengthened. Railway workers and migrant workers often use their rest time to help the communes with spring plowing, drought resistance, manure accumulation, and other tasks.

### 新建铁路沿线建立各级工地党委  贵州全民动员办铁路

    新建铁路沿线建立各级工地党委
    贵州全民动员办铁路
    据新华社贵阳电　贵州省在建设湘黔、滇黔两条铁路的工作中，建立各级工地党委会，进一步加强党的领导，更好地贯彻了全党全民办铁路的方针。
    工地党委由这两条铁路施工主要地区的地（州）委第一书记担任工地党委书记，吸收铁路局、铁道兵部队的负责人，以及铁路沿线的地（州）、县（市）党委负责人为主要成员组成。各工程处、大队（或铁道兵团、营）党委书记，分别参加所在地的县、人民公社党委；而县、公社党委书记则分别参加工程处、大队党委。工地党委的任务是在中共贵州省委的直接领导下，负责领导铁路建设中的政治思想工作、工程布置、劳动力安排、生活物资供应以及组织地区间和部门间的协作等。
    工地党委是为适应今年铁路建设任务重、工期短等要求而建立的。滇黔和湘黔两条铁路建立工地党委以后，政治思想工作做得深透，各项工作都步调一致，进行得迅速顺利。两条铁路确定修建以后，各县在线路工地党委统一领导指挥下，由县委书记挂帅，由公社统一调配劳动力，在一个多月的时间内，就集中了九万多名民工参加筑路。各级党委为了作好民工的领导和教育工作，都配备了较强的干部。九万多名民工中共配备了近百名县级干部，数百名区级干部，以及大批党团员积极分子。此外，为适应筑路工程的需要，各县还配备了一定数量的技术工人。民工们来到铁路工地，个个情绪饱满，干劲冲天。
    滇黔、湘黔两铁路建立工地党委取得的另一效果，是施工准备工作做得快做得好。由于工地党委在人力、物力和财力方面作了统筹安排，过去需要较长时间完成的工作，现在只需很短的时间就可完成。如解决铁路工人和民工的住宿问题，沿线人民在工地党委的领导下，采取突击的办法，用十天的时间就修建了工棚十四万多平方米，加上公社调剂腾出的二十多万平方米的民房，基本上解决了住宿问题。
    此外，还加强了沿线工农之间的团结协作。筑路工人和民工常常利用休息时间，帮助公社搞春耕、抗旱、积肥等工作。
