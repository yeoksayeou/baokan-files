    Soviet "Izvestia" Publishes Article Commenting that Eisenhower's Hypocritical Face Has Been Exposed, Dispelling Some People's Last Illusions About Him
    (Reported by TASS, Moscow, May 22nd) Professor Isakov emphasized in an article in "Izvestia" today that Khrushchev has done everything possible to save the face of the American president. In his article in "Izvestia" entitled "President or General?", Professor Isakov wrote that the US president has played an ignominious role since he first publicly announced that aggressive espionage activities violating Soviet sovereignty (while carrying out these activities, he was feigning concern for peace) are a guiding principle of American policy.
    Isakov wrote: The American president, in contempt of world opinion, has revealed the typical face of a hypocrite in front of all Americans, dispelling the last illusions some people had about him, and making it clear what role he is playing in the shameful farce of defending American policy. However, even in this situation, the head of the Soviet government left him an honest way out of an almost hopeless dead end, which was: to apologize, condemn, punish the criminals, and guarantee that similar things will not happen again.
    Isakov went on to say that the response was: a half-hearted admission, a proposal to temporarily suspend espionage activities until a new president is elected; and even more absurdly, an attempt to blame the Soviet position for the failure of the summit.
    What prompted President Eisenhower to play this ignominious role, making it impossible not only to save his reputation but also to correct the errors of American policy? The author of the article answered this question, emphasizing that behind the entire imperialist policy and espionage plan is the Pentagon, the military apparatus of large monopoly capital. Professor Isakov wrote that Eisenhower, the American general, cannot strike at this carefully selected headquarters of world imperialism, nurtured and fed by taxpayers' dollars.
    Isakov asked: Can this general go against the monopoly capital that put him in power? He replied: Obviously not, even though the president's current behavior is a betrayal of democracy and his own people.
    The author of the article asked: Can President Eisenhower abandon the military pilots who were sent on risky missions, or condemn them? The author replied: The president could have and should have done so. But Eisenhower, the general, was unable to do so. Professor Isakov pointed out that the morality of partnership (even robbers have this morality) outweighs the president's civic obligations to the American people, and outweighs his obligations to all peace-loving mankind.
    Isakov continued: As the president's second term is about to expire, the nominal prestige of the head of government of this most powerful capitalist country (who on the one hand hypocritically talks about peace and on the other hand threatens those countries he dislikes) has been shattered. It seems that this prestige does not exceed the intelligence and moral level of an ordinary general in a capitalist country.
    Isakov recalled that Eisenhower's prestige in the West, especially in the United States, was largely earned as a general and supreme commander during World War II. The author of the article pointed out that he is not worthy of anything outside the military, but is just an ordinary American.
    Isakov went on to say that the American propaganda machine has placed Eisenhower on the shaky throne of military genius. This achievement allowed the general to climb to the post of president of the most powerful capitalist country, even though the American people have never liked military men serving as president. Many monopoly organizations that profit from atomic weapons, rockets, air forces, navies, and other types of weapons have elected him as president twice, although the United States' political and economic achievements during his administration have been insignificant.

    苏联“消息报”载文评称
    艾森豪威尔伪君子面目暴露后
    驱散了某些人对他的最后错觉
    本报讯　据塔斯社莫斯科22日电：伊萨科夫教授今天在“消息报”上著文着重指出，赫鲁晓夫为了挽救美国总统的面子，已经尽了一切努力。伊萨科夫教授在“消息报”上发表的题为“是总统，还是将军？”的文章中写道，自从美国总统第一次公开宣布侵犯苏联主权的侵略间谍活动
  （在进行这种活动时，他打着假惺惺的关怀和平的幌子）是美国的政策方针以来，他扮演了一个不体面的角色。
    伊萨科夫写道：美国总统藐视世界舆论，在全体美国人面前露出了典型的伪君子的面目，驱散了某些人对他的最后错觉，看清了他在为美国政策辩护的可耻丑戏中扮演的角色，然而，即使在这种情况下，苏联政府首脑还给他留了一条老老实实的出路，以便走出几乎绝望的死胡同，这个出路就是：道歉、谴责、惩办罪犯并保证类似的事情不再重演。
    伊萨科夫接着说，但是，得到的回答却是：半推半就地承认，提出在新总统选出以前暂不进行间谍活动；而且更加无聊的是企图把破坏最高级会议的责任归之于苏联的立场。
    是什么促使艾森豪威尔总统扮演这种不体面的角色，促使他不仅没有可能挽救自己的名誉，而且也没有可能纠正美国政策的错误呢？文章的作者对这个问题作了回答，他着重指出：艾森豪威尔将军之所以做不到这个，是因为站在整个帝国主义政策和间谍计划背后的是五角大楼，是大垄断资本的军事机构，伊萨科夫教授写道，艾森豪威尔这位美国将军，不能使这个精心挑选出来的、用纳税人的美元抚育和豢养出来的世界帝国主义的大本营受打击。
    伊萨科夫问道：这位将军是否可以去反对那个让他掌握政权的垄断资本呢？他回答说：很明显，不行，虽然总统目前的行为是对民主和本国人民的背叛。
    文章作者问道：艾森豪威尔总统是否可以抛弃被派出进行冒险活动的军事飞行员，或者对他加以谴责呢？作者回答说：总统本来是可以做而且应当这样做的。但是，艾森豪威尔将军没有能这样做。伊萨科夫教授指出，合伙的道德（强盗也有这种道德）胜过总统对美国人民所负的公民义务，而且胜过对全体爱好和平的人类的义务。
    伊萨科夫接着写道，在总统的第二次任期即将届满的时候，这个最强大的资本主义国家政府首脑（他一方面假心假意地侈谈和平，一方面对那些他所不喜欢的国家进行威胁）的有名无实的威望爆破了，看来，这种威望不超过资本主义国家的一个普通将军的智力和道德水平。
    伊萨科夫追述道，艾森豪威尔在西方，特别是在美国的威望在很大程度上是他作为第二次世界大战时期的一位将军、一位最高总司令而博得的。文章作者指出，他在军队之外什么都不配，而只不过是一个平庸的美国人。
    伊萨科夫接着说，美国宣传机器把艾森豪威尔捧上了摇晃不定的、军事天才的至尊宝座。这一成就使将军爬上了最强大的资本主义国家的总统的职务，尽管美国人民从来就不喜欢军人充任总统。许多靠原子、火箭、空军、海军及其他类型武器谋利的垄断组织两度选他充当总统，虽然在他治理国家期间美国在政治和经济上的成就是微不足道的。
