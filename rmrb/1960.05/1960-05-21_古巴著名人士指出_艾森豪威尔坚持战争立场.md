Xinhua News Agency, Havana, May 19th: Some prominent figures in Cuba, in conversations with Xinhua reporters, condemned the United States' sabotage of the Four-Power Summit and its provocative actions against the Soviet Union and Cuba.

    Emilio Aragonés, a national leader of the "July 26th Movement," said that large American interest groups fear peace and disarmament because it would mean a reduction in their profits. It is these warmongering groups that are attacking the Cuban Revolution, and therefore our people clearly understand the significance of this event.

    Marta Frayde, President of the Cuban Movement for the Defense of Peace and Sovereignty of Peoples, said that the United States' provocative activities against the Soviet Union and Cuba prove that it has adopted a war stance that is contrary to the peaceful aspirations of people all over the world. She said that this completely bankrupts all of Eisenhower's hypocritical words about peace and proves that he has no sincerity for peace.

    Guillén, a distinguished Cuban poet, supported Khrushchev's firm stance on the Four-Power Summit, saying, "Eisenhower is like a cheating gambler who marks the cards in order to win money: on the one hand, he appears at the meeting with a hypocritical face of peace, and on the other hand, he invades Soviet airspace with spy planes. Therefore, there is nothing to talk about with Eisenhower anymore."

    古巴著名人士指出
    艾森豪威尔坚持战争立场
    据新华社哈瓦那19日电　古巴一些著名人士向新华社记者发表谈话，谴责美国破坏四国首脑会议和对苏联及古巴的挑衅行动。
    “7月26日运动”全国领导人埃米略·阿拉戈内斯说，美国大利益集团害怕和平和裁军，因为这意味着要减少他们的利润，攻击古巴革命的也正是这些好战集团，因此我国人民清楚懂得这一事件的意义。
    古巴保卫和平和各国人民主权运动主席玛塔·弗赖德说，美国对苏联和古巴的挑衅活动，证明了它所采取的同全世界人民的和平愿望相违背的战争立场。她说，这使艾森豪威尔关于和平的一切虚伪的言词彻底破产，并且证明了他毫无和平诚意。
    古巴杰出的诗人纪廉支持赫鲁晓夫对四国首脑会议所采取的严正立场，他说，“艾森豪威尔就像为了能够赢钱而在牌上做记号的骗人的赌徒：一方面以伪善的和平面貌出现在会议上，另一方面以间谍飞机侵犯苏联领空。因此同艾森豪威尔已经没有什么可谈的了。”
