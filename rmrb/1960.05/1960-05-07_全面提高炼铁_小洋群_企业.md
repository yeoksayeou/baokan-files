    To rapidly and comprehensively improve the production level of "small-scale foreign method" iron smelting enterprises is of extremely great significance for realizing the continued leap forward of the national economy in 1960 and accelerating the technological transformation of agriculture.
    "Small-scale foreign method" iron smelting enterprises, like other "small-scale foreign method" enterprises, are the product of the Party's General Line. In the past two years, China's "small-scale foreign method" iron smelting enterprises have developed rapidly. In 1958, various localities began large-scale iron and steel production. In 1959, various local iron smelting enterprises generally underwent rectification, consolidation, and improvement. Many "small-scale foreign method" enterprises established their own mines and coal coking bases and initially carried out technological transformation, laying the foundation for further improvement and development. At present, more than half of China's pig iron production relies on small blast furnaces. Many "small-scale foreign method" iron smelting enterprises undertake the task of supplying pig iron to key steel plants, regularly transferring high-quality, high-quantity pig iron to ensure the needs of key steel plants. The current problem is that there are still significant differences in the production levels of existing "small-scale foreign method" enterprises. For example, under the same equipment and technical conditions, the utilization coefficient of blast furnaces in some advanced regions and advanced enterprises has reached more than four tons, while in some it is still less than one ton; the quality of pig iron in some has approached or caught up with the level of modern large-scale enterprises, while in others it has not yet reached national requirements; the cost per ton of pig iron in some is only more than seventy yuan, while in others it is as high as two to three hundred yuan. These situations show that "small-scale foreign method" enterprises still have great potential. Rapidly and comprehensively improving the production level of "small-scale foreign method" iron smelting enterprises, fully leveraging the enormous role of "small-scale foreign method" enterprises, focusing on the various weak links in iron smelting production, vigorously carrying out technological revolution and technological innovation, and conducting comprehensive and systematic technological transformation are currently extremely urgent and important tasks.
    Iron smelting production is continuous. The improvement of any technical and economic indicator in an iron smelting enterprise involves every production link and every production department. Therefore, to comprehensively improve the production level of "small-scale foreign method" iron smelting enterprises, the iron smelting sector must make great efforts, and the mining, coal coking, and transportation sectors must also make great efforts. Because to increase pig iron production, there must first be a sufficient quantity of ore to ensure that the blast furnace is well-fed. To improve the quality of iron, measures must first be taken in all aspects, such as coal washing and coking, to prevent sulfur from passing through. To improve labor productivity and reduce pig iron costs, it is necessary to vigorously carry out technological transformation of mines and coal kilns, change backward production methods and production tools; and vigorously build a transportation network centered on blast furnaces in transportation, and vigorously promote vehicleization, cablewayization, chuteization, wooden railization, and water transportation to eliminate the phenomenon of human back carrying. One of the important experiences of Sichuan Province in comprehensively transforming small-scale foreign method iron smelting enterprises is to vigorously grasp the production of raw and auxiliary materials and in-plant transportation, and to achieve "three sets in groups, transportation into networks." The specific approach is to fully rely on the strength and wisdom of the masses to carry out a series of transformations in major production departments such as smelting, mining, coal coking, and transportation, as well as every production link in each department, so that production between smelting, mining, and coal coking is closely linked, working together under the same goal, mobilizing the masses, deeply developing technological innovation and technological revolution, promoting advanced experience, vigorously tackling weak links, and rapidly realizing the complete and comprehensive technological transformation of "small-scale foreign method" enterprises. With the complete transformation of "small-scale foreign method" enterprises and the comprehensive improvement of production levels, enterprise management will also be improved accordingly, thereby promoting the comprehensive leap forward of the entire enterprise.
    To comprehensively transform and improve "small-scale foreign method" iron smelting enterprises, it is necessary to implement the policy of unified planning, adapting to local conditions, relying on the masses, self-reliance, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and continuously improving. This is the only correct policy for fully utilizing "walking on two legs" to achieve more, faster, better, and more economical transformation of "small-scale foreign method" enterprises. At present, many "small-scale foreign method" iron smelting enterprises across the country urgently demand transformation and improvement. Because the metallurgical and machinery industries bear the heavy task of supporting key construction and agricultural technological transformation, they can only selectively equip some iron plants, mines, and coal coking bases with better resource conditions and larger output within a certain period of time; it is impossible to provide more equipment and steel to fully meet the transformation needs of "small-scale foreign method" enterprises. Most regions and enterprises should adopt the policy of self-reliance, combining indigenous and foreign methods, relying on the masses, vigorously carrying out tool reform and indigenous mechanization, adapting to local conditions, taking materials locally, arming themselves, and carrying out transformation. Experience has proven that implementing the policy of self-reliance and combining indigenous and foreign methods is technically simple, easy to learn and do, does not cost much money, and has quick results. Some comrades always dislike indigenous methods for being "rustic" and not very elegant. In fact, indigenous methods are the product of the collective wisdom of the broad masses. Adopting indigenous methods can most fully mobilize the masses, and most quickly and fully utilize local raw materials and natural conditions, making it easy to overcome the difficulties of insufficient equipment, technology, and raw materials. Therefore, as soon as it appears, it is welcomed and loved by the broad masses. May I ask, is this not elegant? Now, many enterprises with poor foundations and conditions are adopting indigenous methods, and production is rising rapidly. Some enterprises with better foundations are also rapidly improving production by adopting indigenous methods in accordance with local conditions. Therefore, we should have a new understanding of indigenous methods. Now, the various effective indigenous methods created by various localities in the technological innovation and technological revolution movement, on the surface, are low-level and simple; in essence, they are the most scientific and have a uniquely Chinese style. Some indigenous methods are still new developments based on modernization.
    Some people believe that current production tasks are very tight, and equipment and technical conditions are poor, so production cannot be carried out at the same time as transformation, and transformation cannot guarantee current production. This view is obviously one-sided. Production and transformation are not opposed, but closely linked and mutually reinforcing. The tighter the production task and the poorer the material and technical conditions, the more necessary it is to step up technological transformation. Because only by grasping transformation can we create good production conditions and promote rapid improvement in production. Sichuan Province, on the one hand, based on the fact that some "small-scale foreign method" iron smelting enterprises have reached advanced production levels, put forward a period of struggle goals to the masses. On the other hand, closely focusing on current production, it puts the focus of technological transformation on the most important and weakest places in current production, breaking through one weak link and then attacking another weak link, so that production is constantly balanced and continuously improved. As a result, many "small-scale foreign method" enterprises have quickly reached or exceeded advanced indicators through the active transformation of current weak links. Now, the province's pig iron production is leaping forward at a high speed of more than 600 tons per day. There are already more than 100 small blast furnaces with an average utilization coefficient of more than two. It can be seen from this that as long as the ideology is clear, the method is correct, and the arrangements are appropriate, production and transformation can be completely closely linked and mutually promoted.
    Comprehensively improving "small-scale foreign method" iron smelting enterprises is an important task related to the continued leap forward of various sectors of the national economy. Under the guidance of the Party's General Line, on the industrial front, the development of "small-scale foreign method" iron and steel enterprises determines the development of other "small-scale foreign method" enterprises. First, if the "small-scale foreign method" coal mining enterprises are developed, the "small-scale foreign method" iron smelting and steelmaking enterprises can be developed. If the "small-scale foreign method" steel and coal enterprises are developed, other small-scale machinery industries, transportation, chemical industries, petroleum industries... can be developed locally. Therefore, all places with coal and iron resources must focus on steel and coal and run "small-scale foreign method" enterprises on a large scale; all places that have already established "small-scale foreign method" steel enterprises must quickly improve them to drive the high-speed progress of the entire local industry. Party committees at all levels must strengthen their leadership over "small-scale foreign method" iron smelting enterprises. Leaders of all "small-scale foreign method" iron smelting enterprises must adhere to putting politics in command, go deep into production, go deep into reality, strengthen specific leadership over weak links, plant "experimental fields" in the weakest links such as mining, coal coking, and transportation, create experience, establish models, and promote them comprehensively from point to area. We believe that as long as we continuously strengthen the Party's leadership and vigorously carry out mass movements, the production level of "small-scale foreign method" iron smelting enterprises will definitely rise at a high speed in the short term, and it will definitely promote greater development and continuous improvement of various small and medium-sized enterprises in various regions.

    全面提高炼铁“小洋群”企业
    迅速全面地提高炼铁“小洋群”企业的生产水平，对于实现1960年国民经济的继续跃进和加速农业技术改造，具有极其重大的意义。
    炼铁“小洋群”企业和其他“小洋群”企业一样，是党的总路线的产物。近两年来，我国炼铁“小洋群”企业发展很快。1958年各地开始大办钢铁，1959年各地炼铁企业普遍进行了整顿、巩固、提高，不少“小洋群”企业都有了自己的矿山和煤焦基地，并且初步进行了技术改造，为进一步提高和发展打下了基础。目前，我国的生铁产量有一半以上是靠小高炉生产的，许多“小洋群”炼铁企业担负着重点钢厂的生铁供应任务，经常地调出质好量多的生铁，保证重点钢厂的需要。当前的问题是：现有“小洋群”企业的生产水平高低差别还是很大。例如，在同样的设备和技术条件下，有些先进地区和先进企业的高炉利用系数已经达到四吨以上，而有的还不到一吨；生铁质量有的已接近或赶上了现代化大型企业的水平，而有的还没有达到国家要求；每吨生铁成本有的只有七十多元，而有的却高达二、三百元以上。这些情况表明，“小洋群”还蕴藏着巨大的潜力。迅速全面提高炼铁“小洋群”的生产水平，充分发挥“小洋群”的巨大作用，针对炼铁生产中的各个薄弱环节，大搞技术革命和技术革新，进行全面系统的技术改造，是当前十分迫切而重要的任务。
    炼铁生产是有连续性的，炼铁企业里任何一项技术经济指标的提高，都牵连着每一个生产环节和各个生产部门。所以，全面提高炼铁“小洋群”企业的生产水平，炼铁部门固然要作很大的努力，矿山、煤焦、运输等各部门也要作很大的努力。因为要提高生铁产量，首先就要有足够数量的矿石，保证高炉吃饱吃好。要提高铁的质量，就得首先从洗煤、炼焦等各个方面采取措施，不让硫磺过关。要提高劳动生产率，降低生铁成本，就要大力进行矿山、煤窑的技术改造，改变落后的生产方式和生产工具；并且在交通运输上大搞以高炉为中心的运输网，大搞车子化、索道化、溜槽化、木轨化和水运化，消灭人背肩挑的现象。四川省全面改造炼铁小洋群企业的重要经验之一，就是大抓原料和辅助材料的生产和厂内运输，做到“三套成群、运输成网”。具体做法是：充分依靠群众的力量和智慧，对冶炼、矿山、煤焦和运输等主要生产部门，以及各个部门中的每一个生产环节，进行了一系列的改造，使冶炼、矿山、煤焦之间的生产紧密衔接，在同一个目标下通力合作，发动群众，深入开展技术革新和技术革命，推广先进经验，大力突击薄弱环节，迅速实现“小洋群”企业成套的全面的技术改造。随着“小洋群”的成套改造和生产水平的全面提高，企业管理工作也相应得到改进，从而促进整个企业的全面跃进。
    全面地改造和提高炼铁“小洋群”企业，应当贯彻统一规划、因地制宜，依靠群众、自力更生，土洋结合、不断提高的方针。这是充分运用“两条腿走路”，达到多快好省改造“小洋群”企业的唯一正确的方针。现在，全国许多炼铁“小洋群”企业迫切要求改造和提高，冶金和机械工业部门因为担负着支援重点建设和农业技术改造的繁重任务，在一定时期内，只能有重点地装备一些资源条件较好、产量较大的铁厂、矿山和煤焦基地；不可能拿出更多的设备和钢材来全面满足“小洋群”企业改造的需要。多数地区和企业应当采取自力更生、土洋结合的方针，依靠群众，大搞工具改革和土机械化，因地制宜，就地取材，自己武装自己，进行改造。经验证明，贯彻自力更生、土洋结合的方针，技术简单，易学易做，花钱不多，收效很快。有些同志总嫌土办法“土里土气”，不大雅观。其实，土办法是广大群众的集体智慧的产物。采用土办法，能够最充分地发动群众，最迅速、最充分地利用当地的原材料和自然条件，便于克服设备、技术和原材料不足的困难。因而，它一经出现，就受到了广大群众的欢迎和喜爱。请问这不是雅观是什么呢？现在，许多基础和条件较差的企业采取土办法，生产迅速上升，某些基础较好的企业因地制宜地采取土办法，生产也飞快提高。因此，我们对土办法应当有新的理解。现在各地在技术革新和技术革命运动中创造的各种行之有效的土办法，表面看来，它是低级的、简易的；实质上，它又是最科学的，是具有中国独创风格的。某些土法还是在现代化的基础上新的发展结果。
    有人认为，当前生产任务很紧，设备技术条件又差，要生产就不能同时进行改造，要改造就不能保证当前生产。这种看法显然是片面的。生产和改造并不是对立的，而是紧密结合，相互促进的。生产任务愈紧，物质技术条件愈差，就愈需要加紧进行技术改造。因为只有抓紧改造，才能创造良好的生产条件，促进生产迅速提高。四川省一面根据部分炼铁“小洋群”企业已经达到先进生产水平的情况，向群众提出一个时期的奋斗目标，一面紧密围绕当前生产，把技术改造的重点放在当前生产最重要最薄弱的地方，突破一个薄弱环节，再攻一个薄弱环节，使生产不断平衡，不断提高。结果，不少“小洋群”企业通过对当前薄弱环节的积极改造，很快地达到或超过了先进的指标。现在全省生铁产量以日增六百多吨的高速度向前跃进。小高炉利用系数平均达到二以上的已有一百多座。由此可见，只要思想明确，方法对头，安排得当，生产和改造完全能够紧密结合，相互推动。
    全面提高炼铁“小洋群”企业是关系到国民经济各部门继续跃进的一项重要工作。在党的总路线指导下，在工业战线上，钢铁“小洋群”企业的发展，决定着其他“小洋群”企业的发展。首先，采煤的“小洋群”企业发展起来了，炼铁和炼钢的“小洋群”企业才能发展起来，钢铁煤的“小洋群”企业发展起来了，地方上其他小型的机械工业、交通运输、化学工业、石油工业……才能发展起来。所以，凡是有煤铁资源的地方，必须以钢铁煤为中心，大办“小洋群”企业；凡是已经办起钢铁“小洋群”企业的地方，必须迅速进行提高，带动整个地方工业高速度前进。各级党委必须加强对炼铁“小洋群”企业的领导。各炼铁“小洋群”企业的领导者必须坚持政治挂帅，深入生产，深入实际，加强对薄弱环节的具体领导，把“试验田”种到矿山、煤焦、运输等最薄弱的环节上去，创造经验，树立典型，以点带面，全面推广。我们相信，只要不断地加强党的领导，大搞群众运动，炼铁“小洋群”企业的生产水平一定能够在短期内高速度上升，而且还一定能够促进各个地区各种中小企业的更大发展和不断提高。
