Setting up Stoves and Building Kitchens on the Construction Site

In Karamay, the workers all call the Dongfeng Restaurant "Workers' Home." This is because the employees of the Dongfeng Restaurant truly treat their customers like family.

In order to meet the needs of the workers in a faster, better, and more economical way, the Dongfeng Restaurant put forward the slogan "Make it convenient for workers, let customers eat well," and specially added a fast-food section. The dishes that workers like to eat are prepared one by one before opening for business. Workers can eat whatever they want whenever they want, which is very convenient.

In order to allow the exploration, drilling, testing, and oil extraction workers who are fighting day and night in the desolate wilderness to eat delicious meals on the construction site, most of the restaurant employees brought soy sauce beef, fried dough sticks, and hot sesame cakes, and went to the construction site in separate groups, moving back and forth between the derricks to supply food. Some even brought a complete set of cooking utensils and tableware to the construction site thirty or forty kilometers away to set up stoves and build kitchens, light fires, and cook meals, ensuring that the oil extraction army could eat hot meals without having to walk.

When some workers were injured or sick, the restaurant staff would proactively obtain guidance from doctors and make various nutritious meals to deliver to the bedside. Some even fed the injured and sick patients soup and rice. If no one introduced them, it would be difficult to tell whether they were nurses or service personnel. Their communist noble style not only moved the injured and sick patients, but also moved the medical staff.

    在工地上支炉砌灶
    在克拉玛依，工人们都把东风饭店叫作“工人之家”。这是因为东风饭店的职工们，真正做到了对待顾客如亲人。
    东风饭店为了多快好省地满足工人的需要，提出了“使工人方便，让顾客吃好”的口号，特别增设了快餐部。工人们喜欢吃的饭菜，在开门营业前就一样一样地做好，工人们随要随吃，十分便当。
    为了让日夜战斗在荒滩旷野的勘探、钻井、试油和采油工人能在工地上吃上可口的饭菜，饭店大部分职工带上酱牛肉、油条和热烧饼，分头下工地，流动在井架之间来回供应；有的还带上全套炊具和餐具到三、四十公里以外的工地支炉砌灶，生火做饭，保证夺油大军不用走路就能吃上热饭。
    有的工人负伤或有病，饭店职工便主动取得医生的指导，做出各种富有营养的饭食，送到床边。有的还替伤病员喂汤喂饭，如果没人介绍，很难分得出他们是护士还是服务员。他们这种共产主义的高尚风格，不但感动了伤病员，也感动了医务人员。
