Anhui, Fujian, Hubei, and Guangxi
Early Opening for Spring Tea Picking

(Report) Anhui, Fujian, Hubei, and Guangxi provinces have begun picking spring tea. As of April 27th, Anhui Province had produced over 3 million catties of dried tea. In Hubei Province, just fifteen counties including Enshi, Jianshi, and Wufeng, have over 30,000 people up in the mountains picking tea.

This year, due to strengthened tea garden management in various locations, the spring tea buds are generally growing well, and most areas have opened for picking earlier. From April 3rd to April 24th, Qimen County, Anhui Province, produced over 118,000 catties of "Qihong" tea, with top-grade and first-grade tea accounting for over 99%. In Fujian Province, Fuding, Fu'an, and Xiapu counties have actively renovated old tea gardens, strengthened pruning and replanting, enabling the output of old tea gardens to catch up with that of new tea gardens. Currently, tea gardens in all tea-producing areas of the province generally have strong branches and lush leaves. In Guilin Prefecture, Guangxi, tea gardens used to receive very little fertilizer. This year, each mu of tea garden received 30 dan of fertilizer, with the fertilized area accounting for 80% of the total area, resulting in earlier budding, more buds, and stronger growth for this year's spring tea.

While developing tea production at a high speed, various locations have both expanded the area of tea gardens and restored the production of many famous ancient teas. Guangxi has newly built 55 tea farms this year, opening up approximately 200,000 mu of new tea gardens. In addition to vigorously increasing the production of "Qihong" and "Tunlv," Anhui Province has also created "Huohong" and "Shulv." The export of tea has increased fourfold in nine years.

With the development of tea production, various locations have innovated in picking and manufacturing techniques. Fujian Province has newly built and expanded 400 animal-powered, water-powered, and other powered primary processing machinery plants, and plans to train 30,000 skilled tea pickers who can pick tea quickly with both hands. In terms of picking techniques, Anhui has changed from the past methods of "grabbing a handful" and "sweeping clean" to implementing new picking methods such as "picking at the right time," "picking in batches," and "leaving fish leaves to pick," effectively increasing the yield per unit area.

    安徽·福建·湖北·广西
    提早开园采摘春茶
    本报讯　安徽、福建、湖北、广西等省春茶开始采摘。安徽省截至4月27日，全省已采制干茶三百多万斤；湖北省仅恩施、建始、五峰等十五个县，已有三万多人上山采茶。
    今年，由于各地加强了茶园管理，春茶的芽头普遍发得好，大部地区都提早开园采摘。安徽祁门县4月3日开园到4月24日，已采制“祁红”十一万八千多斤，其中特级、一级茶占99％强；福建省福鼎、福安、霞浦县积极改造旧茶园，加强剪修、补植，使旧茶园的产量赶上了新茶园，现在全省各茶区的茶园普遍长得枝壮叶茂；广西桂林专区各县茶园过去很少施肥，今年每亩茶园施肥三十担，施肥面积占总面积的80％，使今年春茶发芽早、芽头多，生得壮实。
    各地在高速度发展茶叶生产中，一方面扩大了茶园面积，同时还恢复了许多古有名茶的生产。广西今年新建茶场有五十五个，开辟新茶园二十万亩左右。安徽省除大力增产“祁红”、“屯绿”外，还创造了“霍红”和“舒绿”，外销茶在九年中增长了四倍。
    随着茶叶生产的发展，各地在采制技术上都有革新。福建省已新建和扩建的畜力、水力等动力初制机械厂四百座，并计划训练双手快速采茶能手三万名；安徽在采摘技术上，改变过去“一把捋”、“一扫光”，实行了“适时采”、“分批采”、“留鱼叶采”等新采摘法，有效地提高了单位面积产量。
