European Countries' Progressive Public Opinion Says
American Provocative Policies Must Be Crushed

The British Communist Party Political Committee issued a statement on the 18th, pointing out that the United States must be held responsible for the failure of the Paris East-West Four-Power Summit.

The statement asked: "How can a conference to end the Cold War be held when the United States takes such actions and expresses its determination to maintain the Cold War with aggressive actions, violating Soviet airspace and international law?" The statement said that Macmillan's refusal to "guarantee that British bases will not be used for such purposes and not to prohibit such flights from British bases encourages the Pentagon's madmen."

French Communist Party General Secretary Maurice Thorez said to workers at the Vitry-sur-Seine factory on the evening of the 18th that people of all countries are watching with anger as the American militarist groups sabotage this conference. The fact that American spy planes violated Soviet airspace proves that these people have not abandoned the policy of "strength" and have not abandoned the "brink of war" policy advocated by former Secretary of State Dulles.

Thorez accused the US President, the French President and the British Prime Minister of trying to shift the responsibility for postponing the conference to the country that suffered from the means they could not tolerate.

The Norwegian Communist Party newspaper "Friheten" published an editorial on the 18th, stating that the Four-Power Summit should have had a clear premise: the meeting should be conducted in an atmosphere of mutual trust with guarantees to prevent provocations. However, this basic rule was undermined in an extremely egregious way by the US government on the eve of the conference. The editorial pointed out that the provocative policies of the US government should be condemned, making it impossible for people to believe in the "peaceful aspirations" that the United States often expresses. It is now clear that this provocative policy of the United States must be thoroughly crushed.

    欧洲国家进步舆论说   
    必须打击美国挑衅政策
    英国共产党政治委员会18日发表声明指出，美国必须对巴黎东西方四国首脑会议未能开成负责。
    声明问道：“在美国采取这样的行动，并且表示它决心用侵略行动，侵犯苏联领空和违反国际法来保持冷战的情况下，怎么能举行结束冷战的会议呢？”声明说，麦克米伦拒绝“保证英国的基地不被用于这种用途，并且也不禁止从英国基地起飞的这种飞行，这种态度鼓励了五角大楼的狂人”。
    法国共产党总书记莫里斯·多列士18日晚上在维特里罗尼普伦工厂向工人们讲话说，各国人民怀着愤怒的心情看到美国军国主义集团破坏了这次会议。美国间谍飞机侵犯苏联领空的这一事实，证明了这些人还没有放弃“实力”政策，没有放弃故国务卿杜勒斯所说的“战争边缘”政策。
    多列士指责美国总统、法国总统和英国首相竭力要把会议推迟的责任推给遭受他们不能容许的手段之害的国家。
    挪威共产党机关报“自由报”18日发表社论说，四国政府首脑会议本来应该有这样一个明确的前提：会议应该在提出防止挑衅的保证的相互信任的气氛中进行。但是，这种基本的规则却被美国政府在会议召开前夕以极为恶劣的方式破坏了。社论指出，美国政府的挑衅政策应该受到谴责，它使人们不可能相信美国经常表示的“和平愿望”。现在很清楚，必须彻底打击美国这种挑衅政策。
