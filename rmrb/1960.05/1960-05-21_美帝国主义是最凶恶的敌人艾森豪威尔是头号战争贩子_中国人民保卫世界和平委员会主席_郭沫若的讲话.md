Comrades, Friends:
    Just as the people of the world were eagerly anticipating the Four-Power Summit Conference to be held as scheduled and to contribute to easing international tensions, U.S. imperialism, defying the world, carried out a blatant invasion of the Soviet Union and single-handedly buried the Four-Power Summit Conference. This bandit behavior of U.S. imperialism is not only a provocation against the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp, but also a provocation against all peace-loving people and countries in the world. The Chinese people express their utmost indignation at the U.S. imperialist crime of aggression. The Chinese people resolutely support the Soviet government's solemn position against U.S. imperialist war provocations and the destruction of the Four-Power Summit Conference.
    The U.S. imperialist crime of aggression against the Soviet Union and destruction of the Four-Power Summit Conference is a major exposure of its vicious face of hostility towards the people of the world and trampling on world peace. In the fifteen years since the Second World War, in order to realize its ambition of dominating the globe, U.S. imperialism has consistently pursued a policy of aggression and war, establishing military bases everywhere, organizing military blocs, and actively preparing for new wars of aggression. It has fostered West German militarism in Europe and revived Japanese militarism in Asia as its tools for war. Recently, U.S. imperialism has been further conspiring to lift restrictions on West German armaments, and, in defiance of the strong opposition of the Japanese people and the people of Asian countries, directed the Kishi Nobusuke reactionary clique to forcibly pass the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty yesterday by means of armed coercion. All this shows that U.S. imperialism is the most vicious enemy of world peace, and Eisenhower, the head of U.S. imperialism, is the number one war peddler. The occasional peace gestures made by U.S. imperialism are merely a smokescreen for it to deceive the people of the world and realize its imperialist ambitions. Now, the people of the world are more aware of the nature of U.S. imperialism than ever before, and understand even more that in order to defend world peace, they must wage a persistent struggle against the war forces headed by U.S. imperialism.
    China and the Soviet Union are strong fortresses for defending world peace. China, the Soviet Union, and all socialist countries have consistently advocated peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, and that all international disputes should be resolved through peaceful negotiation rather than resorting to force, and have made unremitting efforts to ease international tensions. However, U.S. imperialism has consistently acted recklessly, and has consistently threatened the security of all mankind with policies of intimidation and blackmail. This is something that our socialist countries absolutely cannot tolerate, and that peace-loving people all over the world absolutely cannot tolerate. Now the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is so strong, and the forces for world peace are so strong, that if U.S. imperialism mistakenly believes our sincere desire for peace to be a sign of weakness, and dares to continue provoking us, it can be asserted that it will never escape the fate of being burned by its own fire. The 650 million Chinese people will forever stand together with the great Soviet people, with the people of other socialist countries, and with the peace-loving people of the world, to fight to the end for the complete defeat of U.S. imperialism's policies of war and aggression, and for lasting world peace.
    Long live the unbreakable friendship and unity between the Chinese and Soviet peoples!
    People of the world, unite and overthrow U.S. imperialism!
    Long live world peace!

### 美帝国主义是最凶恶的敌人艾森豪威尔是头号战争贩子  中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席　郭沫若的讲话

    美帝国主义是最凶恶的敌人艾森豪威尔是头号战争贩子
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席　郭沫若的讲话同志们，朋友们：
    正当全世界人民热烈期待四国首脑会议能够如期召开，对缓和国际紧张局势作出贡献的时候，美帝国主义竟然冒天下之大不韪，对苏联进行了露骨的侵略，并且一手葬送了四国首脑会议。美帝国主义这种强盗行为，不仅是对苏联的挑衅，对整个社会主义阵营的挑衅，而且是对全世界一切爱好和平的人民和国家的挑衅。中国人民对美帝国主义的侵略罪行表示无比的愤慨。中国人民坚决拥护苏联政府反对美帝国主义战争挑衅和破坏四国首脑会议的严正立场。
    美帝国主义侵略苏联和破坏四国首脑会议的罪恶行为，是它敌视世界人民、蹂躏世界和平的凶恶面目的一次大暴露。第二次世界大战后十五年来，美帝国主义为了实现它称霸全球的野心，一贯执行侵略战争政策，到处建立军事基地，组织军事集团，积极准备新的侵略战争。它在欧洲扶植西德军国主义，在亚洲复活日本军国主义，以作为它的战争工具。最近美帝国主义正在更进一步阴谋取消对西德的军备限制，并且悍然不顾日本人民和亚洲各国人民的强烈反对，指使岸信介反动集团在昨天采取武力威逼的手段，强行通过了日美军事同盟条约。所有这一切说明，美帝国主义是世界和平最凶恶的敌人，美帝国主义的头子艾森豪威尔是头号战争贩子。美帝国主义有时所做出的某些和平姿态，只不过是它欺骗世界人民、实现帝国主义野心的一种烟幕。现在，全世界人民比过去任何时期都更加认清楚了美帝国主义的本质，更加懂得，要想保卫世界和平，就必须同以美帝国主义为首的战争势力进行坚持不懈的斗争。
    中苏两国是保卫世界和平的坚强堡垒。中国、苏联和所有社会主义国家一贯主张不同社会制度的国家和平共处，一切国际争端通过和平协商求得解决，而不诉诸武力，为和缓国际紧张局势进行了不懈的努力。但是，美帝国主义一贯胡作非为，一贯用威慑政策和讹诈手段威胁全人类的安全。这是我们社会主义国家所绝对不能容许的，全世界爱好和平的人民所绝对不能容许的。现在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营如此强大，世界和平力量如此强大，如果美帝国主义竟然把我们的和平诚意误认为是示弱的表现，而胆敢继续挑衅，可以断言，它绝不会逃脱玩火自焚的命运。六亿五千万中国人民将永远同伟大的苏联人民一起，同其他社会主义国家人民一起，同全世界爱好和平的人民一起，为彻底击败美帝国主义的战争和侵略政策、争取世界持久和平而奋斗到底。
    中苏两国人民牢不可破的友谊和团结万岁！
    全世界人民团结起来，打倒美帝国主义！
    世界和平万岁！
