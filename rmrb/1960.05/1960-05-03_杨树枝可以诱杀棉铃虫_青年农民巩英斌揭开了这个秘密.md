　　Poplar Branches Can Lure and Kill Cotton Bollworms
　　Young Farmer Gong Yingbin Unveils the Secret

　　When cotton plants bud and develop bolls, when farmers are happy looking at the promising cotton fields, suddenly, the buds and bolls fall off one by one like prematurely deceased infants. Why is this? Young farmer Gong Yingbin couldn't figure out the mystery.

　　It was one day in June 1955, and he was staring blankly at the cotton field. "Why are the bolls falling off?" He picked up a fallen bud and examined it carefully, discovering a small hole. Breaking it open, he saw a small worm wriggling inside. "Ah! It's this thing! This worm must be hatched from the eggs laid by the moth!" Based on his discovery, people in the cotton fields started using needles to poke the buds with small holes and catching the moths. But one person running around all day could barely catch a few moths. What more effective method could be used? Gong Yingbin pondered this every day. The scorching midday sun made people sweat. People who had been working for half a day were taking a nap, but Yingbin was still squatting in the cotton field, observing the moths' activities. One morning, he was puzzled about not finding any moths when he suddenly saw two cotton bollworm moths flying out of a sunflower disk. He checked all the sunflowers in the cotton field, and each disk harbored two or three moths. That morning alone, he caught more than one hundred and eighty cotton bollworm moths. From then on, the commune mobilized members to catch them every morning. Although the cotton bollworms were not completely eradicated that year, Gong Yingbin understood one thing: to eradicate cotton bollworms, one must first understand their life cycle.

　　He went to the Handan Agricultural Science Research Institute to borrow books on controlling crop pests, seeking knowledge about cotton bollworms. He didn't know many characters and couldn't understand them, so he asked those who were more literate for help. In the evening, after the commune members had all finished work and gone home, Gong Yingbin would take dry rations, carry his bedding, and go to the field to observe how the cotton bollworm moths laid their eggs. He would mark the places where the moths laid eggs with willow branches and sorghum stalks. At night, the fields were pitch black, and Gong Yingbin's flashlight shone brightly as he kept his eyes glued to the moths' activities. The night dew soaked his clothes, but he didn't notice until the moths had all rested, and then he would unfold his bedding and sleep outdoors with the cotton bollworm moths. In this way, he observed in the cotton field for fifteen consecutive days and nights, finally understanding the entire process of a generation of cotton bollworms from reproduction and growth to pupation.

　　In order to more accurately grasp the growth, life, and habits of cotton bollworms, Gong Yingbin also raised cotton bollworms. This allowed him to record the growth, food consumption, and changes caused by different weather conditions of the cotton bollworms on their "death register" at any time. Through raising cotton bollworms and observing them in the field, Gong Yingbin finally fully grasped the life and growth patterns of cotton bollworms.

　　One day, Gong Yingbin went to the agricultural technology extension station again. The staff at the extension station told him, "There is a 'molasses trap' that can lure and kill cotton bollworms. The molasses is made from wine, honey, and bran, and has a sweet and sour taste. You can think of ways to use the sweet and sour taste." Yingbin thought to himself: Good! This is a way to go, I must try it! But then he thought: To make a molasses trap, you need honey and wine, and you also need to make wooden boxes. What will the effect be? Even if the effect is great, with several thousand acres of cotton in the commune, how many tens of thousands of molasses traps would be needed? No! The cost is too high. He said to the comrades in the agricultural technology research group, cotton bollworms like to eat sweet and sour things, let's think of a way to use the sweet and sour taste! So, he led the group members to start "tasting hundreds of herbs." They tasted every kind of grass in the local area, and it was either only sour or only sweet, without both sour and sweet tastes.

　　Later, based on the cotton bollworms' preference for sweet and sour foods, and after many experiments, Gong Yingbin finally found a way to use poplar branches and leaves to lure and kill cotton bollworms. They once spread eight cartloads of poplar branches in six thousand acres of cotton fields. After two or three days, more than 90% of the cotton bollworm moths had died, ensuring the normal growth of the cotton.

　　People with ambition and lofty ideals are constantly seeking progress and are never satisfied with their existing achievements. Gong Yingbin is such a person. During our interview with him, he told us about the many questions he was considering and researching: How do corn borers and rice stem borers occur? How can these pests be eradicated? After communization, fruit trees are being developed on a large scale. What pests are affecting these fruit trees? How can they be eradicated? These questions were swirling in his mind.

    杨树枝可以诱杀棉铃虫
    青年农民巩英斌揭开了这个秘密
    江郝魏
    当棉花生蕾、结铃的时候，当农民看着丰收在望的棉田而高兴的时候，突然，花蕾和棉铃一个个像夭折的婴儿似的脱落了。这是为什么？青年农民巩英斌猜不透这中间的奥秘。
    那是1955年6月的一天，他在棉花地里，眼盯着棉花发呆。“到底为什么落铃”，他拾起一颗脱落的花蕾，仔细观察，发现花蕾上有一小孔，掰开一看，一个小虫在里面蠕动。“啊！是这玩艺！这种虫可能就是飞蛾下的子孵化的吧！”根据他的发现，人们到棉田里发现有小孔的花蕾就用针扎，有飞蛾就捕捉。可是一个人奔跑一天捉不到几只飞蛾。想什么更有效的办法呢？巩英斌天天琢磨。中午火热的太阳晒得人冒汗。干了半天活的人都睡午觉了，英斌一个人仍蹲在棉花地里，观察蛾子的活动。一天早晨，他正为找不到蛾子纳闷，忽然见从向日葵花盘里飞出两个棉铃蛾子。他把棉田里的向日葵都察看了一遍，每个花盘里都伏着两三个蛾子，这一天早晨就捉回棉铃蛾一百八十多个。从此，社里发动社员天天早晨去捕捉。这一年，棉铃虫虽然没有被根本掉除，但是巩英斌懂得一个道理：要想根绝棉铃虫，首先必须掌握住它的生活规律。
    他跑到邯郸农业科学研究所借来除治农作物害虫的书籍，寻找有关棉铃虫的知识。他识字不多，看不懂，就请识字多的人帮助。傍晚，社员们都收工回家了，巩英斌带上干粮，扛着铺盖卷下地观察棉铃蛾怎样产卵，发现蛾子产了卵的地方，就插上柳枝、秫秸作记号。夜里，田野一片漆黑，巩英斌的手电筒一直闪着光芒，两眼紧盯着蛾子的活动。夜露打湿衣服，他不觉得，直到蛾子都休息了，他才展开铺盖卷陪着棉铃蛾露天而睡。就这样，他一连在棉田里观察了十五个昼夜，终于了解了一代棉铃虫由繁殖、成长到化蛹的全部过程。
    巩英斌为了更准确地掌握棉铃虫的生长、生活和习性，他还饲养了棉铃虫。以便随时把棉铃虫的生长、食量、以及因天气不同所引起的变化等都记录在棉铃虫的“生死簿”上。经过对棉铃虫的饲养和实地观察，巩英斌终于全部掌握了棉铃虫的生活、生长的规律。
    一天，巩英斌又跑到农业技术推广站。推广站的人员告诉他说：“有一种‘糖蜜诱杀器’能诱杀棉铃虫，糖蜜用酒、蜜和麸子做成，含有酸甜味道，你们可在酸甜味道上想想办法。”英斌心里想：好！这可是个门路，一定试试，可又想：制成糖蜜诱杀器得用蜜、用酒，还得制木箱，效果到底如何呢？就是效果大，社里几千亩棉花，需做多少万个糖蜜诱杀器呀，不行！成本太高。他对农业技术研究组的同志说，棉铃虫爱吃酸甜味道的东西，咱就在酸甜味道上想办法吧！于是，领导着组员们开始了“尝百草”。他们把当地所有的每一种青草都尝了一遍，不是只有酸味，就是只有甜味，没有又酸又甜味道的。
    后来，巩英斌根据棉铃虫喜食酸甜味道的食物，经过多次试验，终于找到利用杨树枝叶，诱杀棉铃虫的办法。他们曾经将八车杨树枝，散发在六千亩棉花地里。隔了两、三天，90％以上的棉铃蛾死掉了，保证了棉花正常的生长。
    有志气，有远大理想的人，每时每刻都在寻求前进，永远不满足自己已有的成绩。巩英斌就是这样的人。在我们访问他的时候，他说出了他正在考虑和研究的许多问题：玉米钻心虫、谷心虫是怎么发生的？这些虫害怎么根绝？公社化以后，果树在大面积发展，这些果树净有些什么害虫？怎么根绝？这些问题在他的脑子里翻腾。
