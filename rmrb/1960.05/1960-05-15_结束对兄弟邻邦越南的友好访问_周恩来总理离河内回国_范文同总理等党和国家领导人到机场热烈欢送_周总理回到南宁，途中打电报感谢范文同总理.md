Chinese Ambassador to Vietnam He Wei, Vietnamese Ambassador to China Tran Tu Binh, and diplomatic envoys from various countries to Vietnam also went to the airport to see them off.

The band played the national anthems of China and Vietnam. Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi, accompanied by Premier Pham Van Dong, reviewed the guard of honor, shook hands with the Vietnamese party and government leaders who came to see them off, and circled the field once to bid farewell to the masses.

Premier Pham Van Dong and Premier Zhou Enlai both spoke at the airport (for the full text of the speeches, see page four). The speeches of the two premiers were constantly interrupted by storms of applause.

As Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi, accompanied by Premier Pham Van Dong, rode in an open car to the airport, tens of thousands of people who had lined the ten-kilometer road to the airport since early morning, waved Chinese and Vietnamese national flags, shouted slogans such as "Eternal Friendship Between the Peoples of Vietnam and China," warmly paid tribute to the Chinese Premier, and bid farewell to the distinguished Chinese guests with infinite reluctance.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, May 14th: Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Chen Yi, and their entourage, after visiting Cambodia and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, returned to Nanning from Hanoi by special plane this morning.

Staff from the Consulate of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in Nanning also went to the airport to welcome them.

Premier Zhou circled once in front of the welcoming crowd, and everyone cheerfully greeted Premier Zhou. Premier Zhou waved repeatedly and said, "Hello, comrades!"

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 14th: Premier Zhou Enlai sent a telegram to Premier Pham Van Dong when the plane he was on was about to reach the Sino-Vietnamese border. The full text is as follows: Dear Comrade Premier Pham Van Dong:

As I am about to leave the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, please allow me to once again extend to you, and through you, to the Vietnam Workers' Party, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, President Ho Chi Minh, and all the fraternal Vietnamese people my most sincere thanks, and heartily wish you even greater achievements in the cause of building socialism and defending peace in Asia and the world.
