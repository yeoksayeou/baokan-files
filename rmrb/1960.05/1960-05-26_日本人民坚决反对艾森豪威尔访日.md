The Japanese people resolutely oppose Eisenhower's visit to Japan
By Our Staff Commentator

The US imperialism, colluding with the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government, has illegally and forcibly "passed" the US-Japan military alliance treaty, further exposing its sinister activities of intensifying control over Japan and suppressing the Japanese people's patriotic and righteous struggle. In the angry tide of overthrowing the Kishi Nobusuke government, the Japanese people have shouted the slogans "Oppose Eisenhower's visit to Japan" and "Yankees go home!" In recent days, marching demonstration teams from all walks of life in Japan have flocked to the US Embassy in Japan to protest. The "National Council to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty," composed of 140 Japanese political parties and mass organizations, and the Japan Socialist Party sent representatives to the US Embassy on the 24th to submit resolutions, expressing the Japanese people's firm opposition to Eisenhower's visit to Japan. The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan has also decided to exercise its strength and hold a nationwide general strike to strive to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, dissolve the Diet, and prevent the new "Security Treaty" from taking effect, while resolutely carrying out the struggle against Eisenhower's visit to Japan. This is the result of the US imperialism, which aims at aggression and enslavement of the Japanese people, constantly exposing itself. It is also a manifestation of the Japanese people's greatly improved political awareness in the long-term struggle against the US-Japan military alliance treaty and for independence, peace, democracy, and neutrality.

In the fifteen years since the war, the Japanese people have tasted enough of the suffering given by the US imperialism; they have also recognized from their personal experience who is the mortal enemy of the Japanese people. Although the US monopoly capitalist group has tried its best to promote to Japan shortly after the end of World War II that the US policy towards Japan is to "turn the past enemy into today's friend" and "recognize the Japanese people's full sovereignty over Japan and its territorial waters," what the Japanese people have seen is that the US military occupation has plunged the Japanese nation into an unprecedentedly humiliating position: US military bases are spread all over Japan, Japan's sovereignty has been seriously violated, and wherever the US soldiers go, they leave behind traces of killing and persecuting the Japanese people. The Japanese people know that from the post-war period to this year, Japan has paid nearly six billion US dollars just to bear the expenses of the US occupation forces; and according to the materials published by the Japanese Ministry of Justice, since the revision of the criminal jurisdiction clause, the Japanese people have suffered a robbery by the US military every two days, and Japanese women have been raped by the US military every four days; on average, four Japanese people are injured by the US military's atrocities every day, and on average, three people are injured or disabled due to traffic accidents caused by the US military. Although the United States illegally signed a one-sided peace treaty with Japan in 1951 in the name of "ending the state of war" and "ending the occupation," what the Japanese people have seen is not the end of the state of war, but the beginning of Japan's rearmament and the revival of Japanese militarism; what the Japanese people have seen is not the end of the US military occupation, but the US's permanent and "legalized" its occupation of Japan through the so-called US-Japan "Security Treaty."

The US-Japan military alliance treaty, although described by the US-Japan reactionaries as for the "security guarantee and common cooperation" of the US and Japan and can improve Japan's "independence and autonomy," according to this treaty, what "independence and autonomy" has Japan improved? What kind of "security guarantee" can it get? What kind of "common cooperation" is it with the United States? The US-Japan military alliance stipulates that Japan not only guarantees the continued long-term occupation of Japan by the US military, but also further strengthens its subordination to the United States in political, military, and economic aspects; Japan not only has to expand its armaments without limit and openly carry out nuclear armament, but also has to send troops abroad and cooperate with the US military stationed in Japan in combat. The deceased US Secretary of State Dulles once publicly stated that "the US-Japan 'Security Treaty' is not a charity, and of course it is not to ensure Japan's security. This is part of the US security plan." The "Washington Post" said even more bluntly: "The issue of Japan's security guarantee must be considered on the premise of the US security guarantee." And the former commander of the US Eighth Army in Japan, Eichelberger, directly stated: "As long as we hold on to Japan, we will have the industrial potential and the bravest manpower we have seen in the Far East." In this way, isn't the US's intention to eagerly sign the US-Japan military alliance treaty already obvious? What the US imperialism calls improving sovereignty is actually surrendering national rights and humiliating the country for the Japanese people; what the US imperialism calls guaranteeing "security" is nothing more than dragging Japan into the abyss of war and sacrificing the lives and safety of more than 90 million Japanese people to guarantee the "security" of the United States; what the US imperialism calls "common cooperation" is the "common cooperation" of the US-Japan reactionaries colluding to suppress the Japanese people, invade Asian countries, and threaten world peace. This is the fundamental reason why the broad masses of the Japanese people so resolutely prevented the ratification of the US-Japan military alliance treaty, and after Kishi Nobusuke took fascist measures to illegally "pass" this treaty, immediately broke out more fierce resistance, making the Kishi Nobusuke government in a precarious situation.

It is worth noting that Kishi Nobusuke dares to be so rampant in the current extremely isolated and embarrassing situation, brazenly claiming that he has no intention of resigning and dissolving the Japanese Diet, and openly expressing that he will use all his strength to continue to force the Senate to "pass" the proposal to extend the Diet session by 50 days, and to promote the US-Japan military alliance treaty to be approved by both houses of the Diet. It is impossible for Kishi Nobusuke to dare to do this without the instigation and support of the US imperialism.

Kishi Nobusuke's use of violence to illegally "pass" the US-Japan military alliance treaty has been met with greater resistance from the people of the whole country, but US Undersecretary of State Dillon came out to declare that this is "the most satisfying thing" for the United States and a step in developing the "indestructible partnership" between the US and Japan. US officials believe that Kishi Nobusuke's atrocities have "arranged a sound background" for Eisenhower's visit to Japan. They have also repeatedly stated that Eisenhower will still visit Japan. It is not difficult to understand that these expressions from the United States are not only to help Kishi Nobusuke overcome his current difficulties, but also to continue to put pressure on him. The United States has long been constantly implying that Eisenhower's visit to Japan is conditional on the "entry into force" of the US-Japan military alliance treaty.

Now, the broad masses of the Japanese people have increasingly seen clearly that to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke government, one must oppose the US imperialism. The visit of US President Eisenhower to Japan is an important step for the US-Japan reactionaries to further collude and impose the US-Japan military alliance treaty, which symbolizes the shackles of enslavement, on the heads of the Japanese people, meaning the beginning of new disasters for the Japanese people. Since the Japanese people resolutely oppose the US-Japan military alliance treaty, they cannot but resolutely oppose Eisenhower's visit to Japan. The struggle against Eisenhower's visit to Japan has become an important part of the Japanese people's struggle against the US-Japan military alliance treaty and to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke government. Just as Hakamada Satomi, Secretary of the Central Secretariat of the Japanese Communist Party, said, how can we welcome President Eisenhower when we know that the US government is acting like a robber? The Japanese people must now draw a clear line between friends and enemies and resolutely oppose Eisenhower's visit to Japan.

    日本人民坚决反对艾森豪威尔访日
    本报评论员
    美帝国主义勾结日本岸信介政府，非法强行“通过”日美军事同盟条约，进一步暴露了它加紧控制日本、压迫日本人民爱国正义斗争的罪恶活动。日本人民在打倒岸信介政府的怒潮里，发出了“反对艾森豪威尔访问日本”、“美国佬滚回去”的呼声。连日以来，日本各阶层人民的游行示威队伍纷纷涌向美国驻日本大使馆，提出抗议。日本一百四十个政党和群众团体组成的“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”与日本社会党24日先后派代表到美国大使馆递交决议书，表示日本人民坚决反对艾森豪威尔访问日本。日本工会总评议会也决定在行使实力，举行全国性的总罢工争取打倒岸信介内阁、解散国会、阻止新“安全条约”生效的同时，坚决开展反对艾森豪威尔访问日本的斗争。这是以侵略和奴役日本人民为目的的美帝国主义不断进行自我揭露的结果，也是日本人民在反对日美军事同盟条约，争取独立、和平、民主、中立的长期斗争中，政治觉悟大大提高的表现。
    战后十五年来，日本人民尝够了美帝国主义给予的苦难；也从他们切身的经历中认清了谁是日本人民的死敌。尽管美国垄断资本集团在第二次世界大战结束后不久就竭力向日本宣扬美国的对日政策是“变过去的敌人为今天的朋友”，“承认日本人民对日本及其领海有充分的主权”；然而，日本人民所看到的却是美国的军事占领使日本民族陷于历史上从未有过的屈辱地位：美国的军事基地遍布整个日本，日本的主权遭到严重侵犯，美国大兵所到之处无不留下残杀和迫害日本人民的痕迹。日本人民知道，从战后到今年度，日本仅为负担美国占领军费用已付出近六十亿美元；而根据日本法务省公布的材料，自从修改刑事裁判权条款一年的时间内，日本人民每隔两天就要遭受一次美军的抢劫，日本妇女每隔四天就要遭到美军的强奸暴行；每天平均有四个日本人被美军的暴行所伤害，每天平均有三个人因美军的交通肇事受伤或变成残废。尽管美国于1951年在“结束战争状态”、“结束占领”的名义下，非法签订片面的对日和约；然而，日本人民所看到的不是战争状态的结束，却是日本重新武装的开始、日本军国主义的复活，日本人民所看到的不是美军占领的结束，却是美国通过所谓的日美“安全条约”将它对日本的占领永久化和“合法化”。
    日美军事同盟条约，虽则被美日反动派说成是为了日美两国的“安全保障和共同合作”，是可以提高日本的“独立自主”；但是，根据这个条约，日本究竟提高了什么“独立自主”呢？能够得到什么样的“安全保障”呢？同美国是一种什么样的“共同合作”呢？日美军事同盟规定了日本不仅保证美军的继续长期占领日本，而且在政治、军事、经济各方面进一步加强对美国的从属性；日本不仅要无限度地扩充军备、公开进行核武装，而且要派兵出国、协同驻日美军作战。美国已死的国务卿杜勒斯曾经公开说过，“日美‘安全条约’不是慈善事业，当然不是为了保障日本的安全。这是保障美国安全计划的一部分。”“华盛顿邮报”说得更加露骨：“日本的安全保障问题，必须以美国的安全保障为前提而加以考虑。”而美国前驻日第八军军长艾奇伯格直截了当地提出：“只要我们抓住日本不放，在远东便有工业的潜力以及我们所见到的最勇敢的人力。”这样，美国所以急于签订日美军事同盟条约的用心，不是已经昭然若揭了吗？美帝国主义所谓的提高主权，对日本人民来说，却是丧权辱国；美帝国主义嘴里的保障“安全”，不过是把日本拖向战争深渊，以牺牲九千多万日本人民的生命安全来保障美国“安全”；美帝国主义所谓的“共同合作”，就是美日反动派勾结起来，镇压日本人民，侵略亚洲国家、威胁世界和平的“共同合作”。这就是为什么日本广大人民如此坚决地阻止批准日美军事同盟条约，而在岸信介采取法西斯手段非法“通过”这个条约以后，立即爆发了更加激烈的反抗，使得岸信介政府处在风雨飘摇之中的根本原因。
    值得注意的是，岸信介竟敢在目前极端孤立和狼狈的境况下表现得如此猖狂，悍然声称，他无意辞职和解散日本国会，公然表示要用全部力量，继续强使参议院“通过”延长国会会期五十天的提案，促使日美军事同盟条约得到国会两院的批准。岸信介所以敢于这样做，如果没有美帝国主义的怂恿和支持是不可能的。
    岸信介施用暴力非法“通过”日美军事同盟条约，遭到全国人民更大的反抗，但美国副国务卿狄龙却出面声明，这是美国“感到最满意的事”，是发展美日两国“不可破坏的伙伴关系”的步骤。美国官员认为岸信介的暴行已为艾森豪威尔访问日本“安排好了一个健全的背景”。他们还一再表示，艾森豪威尔仍将访问日本。而不难了解，美国的这些表示，不只是为了帮助岸信介渡过他目前的难关，而且也是对他继续施加压力。美国方面早已不断暗示，艾森豪威尔访问日本是以日美军事同盟条约“生效”为条件的。
    现在，日本广大人民已越来越看清楚了，要打倒岸信介政府，就不能不反对美帝国主义。美国总统艾森豪威尔访问日本，正是美日反动派进一步勾结起来，把象征着奴役枷锁的日美军事同盟条约强加到日本人民头上的一个重要步骤，意味着日本人民新的灾难的开始。日本人民既然坚决反对日美军事同盟条约，就不能不坚决反对艾森豪威尔访问日本。反对艾森豪威尔访问日本的斗争，已经成为日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约，打倒岸信介政府斗争的一个重要组成部分。正像日共中央书记局书记袴田里见所说的，当我们知道美国政府像强盗那样行事的时候，我们如何能欢迎艾森豪威尔总统呢？日本人民现在必须在朋友和敌人之间划清界线，并且坚决反对艾森豪威尔访问日本。
