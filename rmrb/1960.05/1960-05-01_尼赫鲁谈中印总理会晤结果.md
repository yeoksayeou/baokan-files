　　Xinhua News Agency, 30th -- According to the Indian Information Service, Indian Prime Minister Nehru, after seeing off Premier Zhou Enlai on April 26th, answered reporters' questions at the airport and also made a speech on the same day at the People's Assembly meeting regarding the results of the meeting between the Prime Ministers of China and India.

　　In his speech at the People's Assembly, Nehru stated that the China-India Prime Ministers' meeting fully demonstrated the thinking regarding their respective positions and propositions, but "failed to convince each other." He indicated that it is appropriate for officials to conduct research at this stage, followed by further handling of the issue. He also said, "Obviously, while this work is in progress (and in other cases as well), we must avoid conflicts in these border areas, as these conflicts are beneficial to no one."

　　Nehru made similar remarks at the airport. He said, "We will continue to try, and one cannot rule out the possibility of success."

　　However, in both speeches, Nehru attacked China for "aggression" and implementing "expansionism." Nehru stated in the People's Assembly, "The important thing is that China has entered our territory, entered a large piece of our territory, and we consider this aggression. This is the whole basis for him (Premier Zhou) coming here." He also said at the airport, "If we think, if I say to them that they have come onto our territory, what does that mean? Obviously it means they have committed aggression." When someone asked him whether his basic view of so-called "Chinese expansionism" had changed after this long meeting, Nehru replied, "I have always held a historical view, and I still hold this view."

　　In his speech at the People's Assembly, Nehru refused to accept China's reasonable position on the western sector of the Sino-Indian border. He said that there are great differences between the two countries regarding the actual situation in the western sector, to the extent that there is no "meeting point."

　　Regarding the issue of both sides ceasing patrols, Nehru said that the Indian people "will be completely free to operate in these areas without getting involved in conflicts." He said, "This communique states that both sides should make every effort to avoid friction and conflict in the border areas. This is the general direction we have taken and pointed out." But he also said, "We feel that it is very difficult, and also inappropriate in part, to be very clear about this matter."

    尼赫鲁谈中印总理会晤结果
    表示由官员一级进行研究后再进一步处理边界问题是适当的
    竟攻击我国进行“侵略”并拒绝我对中印西段边界的合理立场
    新华社30日讯　据印度新闻处报道，印度总理尼赫鲁4月26日送别周恩来总理以后，在机场回答记者问题时和当天在人民院会议上都就中印两国总理会晤结果发表了谈话。
    尼赫鲁在人民院讲话中认为中印总理会谈充分说明了对于各自的立场和主张的想法，但是“没有能够使彼此信服。”他表示，目前由官员一级进行研究，然后再进一步处理这个问题是适当的。他并说，“显然，当这个工作正在进行的时候（并且在其他情况下也是一样），我们必须避免在这些边境地区发生冲突，因为这些冲突对任何人都没有好处。”
    尼赫鲁在机场上也作了类似的谈话。他说：“我们将继续进行尝试，人们不能排斥取得成功的可能性。”
    但是在两次谈话中，尼赫鲁竟然攻击中国进行“侵略”，中国实行“扩张主义”。尼赫鲁在人民院说：“重要的事情是，中国进入了我们的领土，进入了我们的一大块领土，我们认为这是侵略。这是他（周总理）到这里来的整个基础。”他在机场上还说，“如果我们认为，如果我对他们说，他们到我们的领土上来了，那意味着什么呢？显然这意味着他们进行了侵略。”有人问他经过这次长时间的会谈以后，对于所谓“中国扩张主义”的基本看法是否改变了，尼赫鲁回答说：“我一向持有的是一个历史的看法，我仍然持有这种看法。”
    尼赫鲁在人民院讲话中拒绝接受中国对中印西段边界的合理立场。他说，两国在西段的实际情况方面存在着很大的分歧，以致没有“会合点”。
    尼赫鲁在谈到双方停止巡逻的问题时说，印度的人“将完全可以自由地在不卷入冲突的情况下在这些地区活动”。他说，“这项公报中说到，双方应该作出一切努力来避免在边界地区发生摩擦和冲突。这是我们所采取的和我们所指出的总的方向。”但是他又说，“我们觉得，这件事情上要说得很明确是非常困难的，部分地说也是不适宜的。”
