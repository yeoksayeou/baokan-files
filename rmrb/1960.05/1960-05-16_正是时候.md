It's Just the Right Time

    After the factories and street factories of various communes in Beijing adopted various forms of technical education to enable the broad masses of housewives to quickly master production techniques, they fully demonstrated their talents in production as if winged steeds had been given wings.

    Commune-run factories and street factories all started from scratch. The housewives who participated in production initially did not understand operating techniques. Therefore, how to quickly improve their skills became a major problem currently facing them. Commune-run factories and street factories in Beijing have adopted methods such as "sending people out to learn," "inviting people in to teach," and running their own technical classes to widely develop technical education. Practice over the past year has proven that this flexible and diverse technical education, combined with production, is not only suitable for the characteristics of commune factories, but also enables housewives to learn technology more quickly in the production process.

    In carrying out technical education in commune factories, it is also necessary to do a good job in political and ideological work. Women who leave their homes to participate in production often develop feelings of inferiority and fear of difficulty when they begin to learn technology. Therefore, it is necessary to liberate their minds and establish lofty ambitions. Facts have proven that only by first grasping this key issue can technical education be carried out smoothly, and the housewives participating in production can quickly master production skills, thereby promoting continuous improvement in production.

    正是时候
    北京各个公社工厂和街道工厂，采取多种形式进行技术教育，使广大家庭妇女迅速地掌握了生产技术以后，如同骏马添了双翼一样，在生产上充分地发挥出她们的才智。
    社办工厂和街道工厂，都是白手起家的，参加生产的家庭妇女开始都不懂操作技术，因此怎样尽快地提高她们的技术，就成为当前所面临的一个大问题。北京社办工厂、街道工厂采取“派出去学”、“请进来教”、自办技术课等办法，广泛展开技术教育。一年来的实践证明，这样结合生产进行灵活多样的技术教育，既适合公社工厂的特点，又能较快地使家庭妇女在生产过程中学会技术。
    在公社工厂中进行技术教育，还必须做好政治思想工作。走出家庭参加生产的妇女，在开始学习技术时往往产生自卑和畏难情绪，因此必须解放思想，树立雄心壮志。事实证明，只有首先抓住这个关键性的问题，技术教育才能够顺利地开展，参加生产的家庭妇女们也就能够迅速掌握生产技能，从而促进生产不断提高。
