Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 17th: Seoul Dispatch: As the economic crisis in South Korea deepens, the Seoul stock exchange has come to a standstill.

    According to the South Korean Economic News Agency, there are virtually no stock transactions for South Korean companies at present, and the "national debt" transactions carried out by the puppet authorities through the stock market by coercive methods have also become a mere formality.

    It is reported that the depression in the South Korean stock market is due to the puppet authorities' "restriction of lending funds," tight monetary policy, and also to the severe economic chaos.

    汉城证券交易陷于停顿
    新华社平壤17日电　汉城消息：随着南朝鲜经济危机日益加深，汉城的证券交易已陷于停顿状态。
    据南朝鲜经济通讯社报道，目前，南朝鲜各公司的股票事实上连一笔交易也没有，傀儡当局通过证券市场、以强制方法进行的“国债”交易也只剩了一个名目。
    据报道，南朝鲜证券市场的萧条是由于傀儡当局“限制贷与资金”，银根奇紧，还由于严重的经济混乱。
