    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 4th: It has been announced that Indian Communist Party candidate, Indrajit Gupta, has been elected as a member of the People's Assembly in a by-election in Calcutta.
    Gupta was elected in the Calcutta Southwest constituency. He received 71,548 votes, surpassing his Congress Party opponent, Ashok Krishna Dutt, by 13,313 votes. The third candidate, Adil Bannerjee of the Praja Socialist Party, only received 5,536 votes and therefore lost his deposit.
    This election took place amidst a hysterical atmosphere of anti-China and anti-communist sentiment stirred up by right-wing forces in India. In addition, this was the first parliamentary election in India conducted under a new system requiring voters to present photo identification cards before exercising their right to vote.

    在人民院补缺选举中
    印度共产党候选人当选
    新华社新德里4日电　据宣布，印度共产党候选人英德拉吉特·古普塔在印度人民院补缺选举中在加尔各答当选为人民院议员。
    古普塔是在加尔各答西南议会选区当选的。他获得七万一千五百四十八票，比他的国大党对手阿索克·克里希纳·杜特多得一万三千三百一十三票。第三个候选人、人民社会党的阿迪尔·班纳吉只得五千五百三十六票，因而失掉保证金。
    这次选举是在印度右翼势力煽动的反华、反共的歇斯底里的气氛中进行的。此外，这是印度第一次根据新制度举行的议会选举，新制度规定选民在行使选举权之前必须交出附有像片的身份证。
