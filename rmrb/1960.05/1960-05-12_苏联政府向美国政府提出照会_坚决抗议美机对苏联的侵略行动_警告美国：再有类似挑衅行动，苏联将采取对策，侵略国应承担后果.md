Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 11th: TASS reported from Moscow on the 10th: The Soviet government has sent a note to the U.S. government, firmly protesting the aggressive actions of U.S. aircraft intruding into Soviet airspace. The note also warned the U.S. government: "If similar provocative actions occur again, then the Soviet government will have to take countermeasures, and the government of the country engaging in aggressive behavior towards other countries will bear the responsibility for the consequences arising therefrom."

The note was delivered by Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko to Mr. Freers, the Charge d'Affaires ad interim of the U.S. Embassy in the Soviet Union, on the 10th.

The note pointed out that the military aircraft shot down by Soviet rocket forces on May 1st had intruded more than two thousand kilometers into Soviet territory. After examining all the materials in Soviet possession, experts have established with certainty that the intruding aircraft was American, that it was regularly based in Turkey, and that it had flown into the Soviet Union via Pakistan with hostile intent. This aircraft was equipped with special equipment for reconnaissance and espionage activities in Soviet airspace. The instruments on board were intended for aerial photography and for detecting Soviet radar networks and other special radio technology equipment belonging to the Soviet air defense system. The Soviet expert committee conducting the investigation possesses conclusive evidence proving that the U.S. aircraft was carrying out a mission of espionage reconnaissance: photographs of Soviet defense projects and industrial enterprises, recordings of signals from Soviet radar stations, etc. The pilot, Powers, confessed that he had done everything strictly according to the instructions he had received.

The note pointed out that the U.S. State Department, in an official statement to the press on May 5th, had fabricated the story as if the aircraft was conducting upper atmospheric meteorological observations along the Turkish-Soviet border. After the above statement had been proven completely absurd, the U.S. State Department issued a new statement on May 8th, forced to admit that the aircraft flew into Soviet territory for the purpose of military reconnaissance, thereby admitting that the aircraft's flight had an aggressive purpose. It is clear from this that after three days, the U.S. State Department had to abandon its original claim, which was obviously intended to mislead world opinion and U.S. domestic opinion.

The note then pointed out that the U.S. State Department, in its statement, cited the "Open Skies" proposal put forward by the U.S. government in 1955 for reconnaissance purposes, and mentioned the Soviet government's rejection of this proposal. The note said: "Does all this not mean that, when many countries refuse to accept the above-mentioned 'Open Skies' proposal, the United States is attempting to unilaterally 'open' the skies of other countries?" The note said that it can be concluded from the U.S. State Department's statement of May 8th that the hostile actions carried out by U.S. aircraft against the Soviet Union more than once are not simply the result of the actions of U.S. military command in a certain area, but a reflection of a U.S. established policy. The U.S. government has not only failed to take measures to stop the aforementioned actions of U.S. aircraft, but has also formally announced that such actions are the policy of its country.

It is clear from this that, first, the U.S. government proved that its reply to the protest lodged by the Soviet government was a perfunctory reply intended to cover up the essence of the problem, and also proved that all violations of the Soviet border by U.S. aircraft were actions in accordance with U.S. policy. Second, the U.S. government permitted U.S. aircraft to carry out such actions, thereby making the situation even more serious.

The note then said, how can the statements of U.S. leaders be compatible with such actions? U.S. leaders stated that the U.S. government, like the Soviet government, is also committed to improving relations between the Soviet Union and the United States and to easing international tensions and strengthening trust between countries. Can the sending of one's own aircraft across the borders of another country for military reconnaissance activities be called improving relations and strengthening trust?

The note said that, naturally, the Soviet government in this situation had to issue strict orders to its armed forces: to take all necessary measures to repel foreign aircraft violating the Soviet border.

The Soviet government regrets to point out that the Soviet government is taking all possible measures to lead to the normalization and health of the international situation, while the U.S. government is taking a different path. The purpose of the recent actions taken by the U.S. authorities is clearly to drag U.S.-Soviet relations back to the worst period of the "Cold War" and to poison the international situation on the eve of the summit meeting.

The note said that the Soviet government cannot fail to notice that the U.S. State Department's statement (the shamelessness of which is unprecedented) not only defends the provocative flights of U.S. armed forces aircraft, but also considers such actions to be a "normal phenomenon," thus, in effect, declaring that the U.S. still intends to continue to provocatively intrude into Soviet airspace for reconnaissance in the future.

Thus, the Soviet government comes to the conclusion that the U.S. State Department's statement that the flight was unknown to and unauthorized by the U.S. government is not in accordance with reality, because in this very statement it also defends the necessity of conducting reconnaissance against the Soviet Union. This means that the espionage activities of U.S. aircraft are permitted by the U.S. government.

The note said that the Soviet government warns the U.S. government that if similar provocative actions occur again, then the Soviet government will have to take countermeasures, and the government of the country engaging in aggressive behavior towards other countries will bear the responsibility for the consequences arising therefrom. The statement concluded by saying that the Soviet government sincerely hopes that the U.S. government can finally believe that stopping the aforementioned dangerous provocative actions against the Soviet Union, "stopping the Cold War," and finding ways to jointly work to solve the outstanding international issues that the people of all countries are looking forward to solving with the Soviet Union and other relevant countries on a mutually acceptable basis, is in the interest of maintaining and strengthening international peace, which also includes the interests of the American people.

### 苏联政府向美国政府提出照会  坚决抗议美机对苏联的侵略行动  警告美国：再有类似挑衅行动，苏联将采取对策，侵略国应承担后果

    苏联政府向美国政府提出照会
    坚决抗议美机对苏联的侵略行动
    警告美国：再有类似挑衅行动，苏联将采取对策，侵略国应承担后果
    新华社11日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科10日讯：苏联政府向美国政府提出了一份照会，坚决抗议美国飞机侵入苏联领空的侵略行动。照会并警告美国政府：“如果再发生类似的挑衅行动，那么苏联政府将不得不采取对策，那些有侵略他国的行为的国家的政府将要对由此而产生的后果承担责任”。
    这份照会已由苏联外交部长葛罗米柯在10日交给了美国驻苏联大使馆临时代办弗里尔斯。
    照会指出，5月1日被苏联火箭部队所击毁的一架军用飞机，曾经侵入苏联境内二千多公里。专家们在研究苏联所掌握的全部材料后，确凿地查明，入侵飞机是美国的，它经常以土耳其为基地，它抱有敌对目的经由巴基斯坦飞入苏联。这架飞机备有在苏联领空进行侦察和间谍活动用的特别装备。飞机上装备的仪器，是为了进行空中摄影和发现苏联雷达网和其他属于苏联防空系统的特别无线电技术设备。进行调查工作的苏联专家委员会拥有下面确凿证据，证明美国飞机是进行间谍侦察任务的：苏联防御工程和工业企业的照片、苏联雷达站讯号的录音带，等等。飞行员鲍尔士供认，他所做的一切是完全按照他所接受的指示进行的。
    照会指出，美国国务院5月5日在向报界发表正式声明中，曾捏造说仿佛这架飞机是沿着土耳其—苏联疆界进行大气高层的气象考察的。而在上述说法已被证明完全荒谬之后，美国国务院于5月8日发表新的声明，被迫承认飞机飞到苏联境内是抱有军事侦察目的的，从而也就承认这架飞机的飞行具有侵略的目的。由此可见，经过三天，美国国务院不得不放弃原先的说法，这种说法显然是想迷惑世界舆论和美国国内舆论。
    照会接着指出，美国国务院在自己的声明中引证了美国政府1955年所提出的、以侦察为目的的“开放天空”的建议，提到了苏联政府拒绝接受这个建议。照会说：“所有这一切不就等于说，当许多国家拒绝接受上述关于‘开放天空’的建议时，美国企图擅自‘开放’别国的天空吗？”照会说，从美国国务院5月8日的上述声明中可以得出结论，美国飞机不止一次地对苏联进行的敌对行动，不单纯是美国军事司令部在某个地区的行动的结果，而是美国既定政策的反映。美国政府不但没有采取措施停止美国飞机的上述行动，反而正式宣布这种行动是自己国家的政策。
    由此可见，第一、美国政府证明了它对苏联政府提出的抗议的答复是一件敷衍了事的复文，打算掩盖问题的本质，还证明了美国飞机对苏联国境的一切侵犯都是符合美国政策的行动。第二、美国政府准许美国飞机进行这种行动，从而使情况更加严重了。
    照会接着说，试问，美国领导人的声明如何能同这种行动相适应呢？美国领导人声明说什么美国政府像苏联政府一样，也致力于苏美之间的关系的改善以及缓和国际紧张局势和加强国与国之间的信任。难道可以把一个国家派遣自己飞机越过他国国境进行军事侦察活动称之为改善关系和加强信任吗？
    照会说，自然，苏联政府在这种情况下不得不给自己的武装部队发出严格的命令：采取一切必要的措施来回击侵犯苏联国境的外国飞机。
    苏联政府遗憾地指出，苏联政府采取一切可能的措施以导致国际局势正常化和健康化，而美国政府却在走另一条道路。美国当局最近采取的行动的目的，显然是要把美苏关系拖回到“冷战”最坏时期的状态，并且毒化最高级会议前夕的国际局势。
    照会说，苏联政府不能不注意到，美国国务院的声明（其无耻程度是空前未有的）不仅替美国武装部队的飞机挑衅性的飞行进行辩护，而且认为这种行动是“正常现象”，这样，实际上就是声明美国今后仍然打算继续挑衅性地侵入苏联领空来进行侦察。
    这样，苏联政府便得出一个结论：美国国务院声明说什么飞行是美国政府事先不知道的而且未得到它的允许，这种说法是不符合实际情况的，因为就在这个声明中还在替对苏联进行侦察的行动的必要性作辩护。这就是说，美国飞机的间谍活动是得到美国政府准许的。
    照会说，苏联政府警告美国政府，如果再发生类似的挑衅行动，那么苏联政府将不得不采取对策，那些有侵略他国的行为的国家的政府将要对由此而产生的后果承担责任。声明最后说，苏联政府真诚地希望，美国政府最后能认为，停止对苏联进行上述的危险挑衅行动，“停止冷战”以及寻找途径共同努力在互相可接受的基础上同苏联和其它有关国家解决各国人民所期待解决的悬而未决的国际问题，这是符合维护和巩固国际和平的利益的，其中也包括符合美国人民的利益。
