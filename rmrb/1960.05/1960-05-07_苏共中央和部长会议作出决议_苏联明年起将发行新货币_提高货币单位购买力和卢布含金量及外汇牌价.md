Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 5th, TASS dispatch: The resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union on increasing the purchasing power of the monetary unit tenfold starting from the beginning of 1961 and on raising the gold content and foreign exchange rate of the ruble was published here.

The resolution points out that starting from January 1, 1961, new currency will be issued, and the old currency currently in circulation will be exchanged for the new currency at a conversion rate of ten old rubles for one new ruble.

The resolution points out that with the rapid development of the economy and the great acceleration of monetary turnover, it is necessary to increase the value of the monetary unit and further increase the purchasing power of the monetary unit by changing price standards.

The resolution says that at the same time as issuing the new currency, all retail, procurement, and wholesale prices will be calculated at a rate of ten to one, and rent, all municipal service fees, transportation fees, living expenses, entertainment fees, and other service fees will be converted at the same rate. Wages, pensions, subsidies, other various forms of labor remuneration, and monetary payments to residents will also be calculated at this rate.

The resolution emphasizes that implementing this measure will not cause any loss to the people or the country.

The resolution stipulates that old banknotes and old coins must be exchanged before April 1, 1961.

The resolution instructs the Soviet Ministry of Finance, the Soviet State Planning Committee, and the Soviet State Bank to draft a plan for determining the new ruble exchange rate and increasing the gold content of the ruble. Foreign debts owed to the Soviet Union due to Soviet loans will be converted according to the new ruble exchange rate. This conversion will be carried out without causing losses to the Soviet Union or foreign countries.

    苏共中央和部长会议作出决议
    苏联明年起将发行新货币
    提高货币单位购买力和卢布含金量及外汇牌价
    新华社5日讯　塔斯社莫斯科5日讯：这里发表了苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议关于自1961年初开始把货币单位的购买力提高到十倍以及关于提高卢布含金量和卢布外汇牌价的决议。
    决议指出，自1961年1月1日起将发行新币，目前流通的旧币要换成新币，换算的比率是：旧币十卢布折合新币一卢布。
    决议指出，在经济发展和货币周转大大加速的情况下，有必要提高货币单位的价值，并通过改变价格标准的方法把货币单位的购买力提得更高。
    决议说，在发行新币的同时，所有零售、收购和批发价格都以十比一的比率计算，房租、所有市政服务费、运输费、生活费、娱乐费和其他服务费都按同样的比率折算。工资、优恤金、补助金、其他各种劳动报酬和对居民的货币支付也都按照这个比率计算。
    决议强调指出，实行这个措施不论对人民或国家都不会带来损失。
    决议规定，旧纸币和旧硬币要在1961年4月1日以前兑换完毕。
    决议责成苏联财政部、苏联国家计划委员会和苏联国家银行起草关于规定新的卢布外汇牌价和提高卢布含金量的方案。外国由于苏联的贷款而对苏联的负债将根据新的卢布牌价折算。这种折算将在不给苏联和外国带来损失的情况下进行。
