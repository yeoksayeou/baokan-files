    A Thousand-Year-Old Barren Mountain Gets a New Look
    Yao Jingyu, Deputy Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Zhao'an County Committee, Fujian Province. Poem. Yang Qingyun Painting.
    Three majestic mountains stand before the battlefield,
    Wielding silver hoes like swords and spears;
    The whole people fought for five days and nights,
    A thousand-year-old barren mountain gets a new look.
    Today sweat pours like rain opening the mountain,
    Tomorrow flowers and fruits will perfume the land;
    The people's commune has great power,
    Forcing barren mountains to offer their treasures.

    千年荒山换新装
    中共福建诏安县委副书记  姚景玉  诗  杨青云画三峻岭前摆战场，挥动银锄似刀枪；全民奋战五昼夜，千年荒山换新装。今日开山汗如雨，明朝花果遍地香；人民公社力量大，迫令荒山献宝藏。（附图片）〔原载福建日报〕
