    The Changes in Beijing on Stage
    —Thoughts on Seeing the Play "Flowers Bloom Everywhere, Thousands of Homes Fragrant"
    Lin Ling
    Historically, Beijing is a very ancient city of our motherland. In terms of the rapid changes in the ten years since liberation, the new Beijing is still young. Now, Beijing is experiencing the great era of the people's commune movement in the development of our country's history. To reflect the pulse of the times in the form of drama, quickly and vividly, on the stage, so that the creators of history can sit in the audience and watch, can not only see clearly the historical significance of what they have done, but also encourage themselves to take greater efforts to continue to create new history, this is an important aspect of theatrical work.
    After watching the play "Flowers Bloom Everywhere, Thousands of Homes Fragrant" performed by the Beijing People's Art Theatre, I had this feeling. This is a new play that shows the new changes in Beijing. Reflecting the changes in Beijing seems to be the main repertoire of the People's Art Theatre named after Beijing. From the stage of the Capital Theatre, we have seen "Teahouse," which narrates the social evolution of several dynasties from the late Qing Dynasty, the early Republic of China, until the eve of liberation; "Rickshaw Boy," which reflects the tragic life of the 1920s; and "Peking Man," which reflects the metabolism of the 1930s. There are also "Dragon Beard Ditch," which shows the new atmosphere in the early days of liberation, "Female Shop Assistant," "Red Courtyard," and "Flowers Bloom Everywhere, Thousands of Homes Fragrant," which show the great changes in Beijing society and the internal essence of the great changes in people's hearts since the Great Leap Forward.
    Neighborhood residents organize themselves, housewives are liberated from the tedious work of cooking, washing clothes, sewing, and taking care of children, they run factories, participate in productive labor, and create social wealth, which naturally further develops into urban people's communes—this is the theme of "Flowers Bloom Everywhere, Thousands of Homes Fragrant."
    The author has grasped the most basic link in the establishment of urban people's communes—running factories and organizing productive labor—to describe the communization movement, which is a very correct creative method. Women set up street factories to manufacture glassware, from manufacturing test tubes to manufacturing ampoules, from mastering the production of ampoules to accepting orders for eye drop bottles. The continuous development and sustained leap forward process shows that women have established nurseries, kindergartens, canteens, laundry rooms, and sewing societies in order to subordinate everything to production, so that they can be completely liberated from housework. Development and leap forward are accompanied by ideological struggle. The forms of ideological struggle are diverse. The audience can see their own shadow in the ideological struggle of various types of people, thus helping to solve their own ideological problems.
    Running factories diligently and thriftily, subordinating one's own production to the needs of society, rather than simply pursuing profits, and overcoming ideological and technical difficulties in order to make production subordinate to the needs of society. "Flowers Bloom Everywhere, Thousands of Homes Fragrant" unfolds a dramatic conflict on this issue. Thanks to the correct leadership of the Party, all problems are readily solved, and as a result, a situation of flowers blooming everywhere and fragrance spreading to thousands of homes has emerged. The drama always expresses these contradictions and struggles in an optimistic tone, and the whole play is full of comedy atmosphere.
    A major part of the urban people's commune issue is the women's liberation issue. "Female Shop Assistant" reflects one aspect of solving this problem, "Red Courtyard" reflects another aspect of solving the problem, and "Flowers Bloom Everywhere, Thousands of Homes Fragrant" further reflects a more comprehensive solution to this problem. From these plays, from the stage, we not only see the changes in Beijing, but more importantly, we see the specific solution to the women's problem, and especially importantly, we see how the basic organizations of the new society—the people's communes—are formed and developed in the cities. The fact that the drama can quickly and timely reflect these problems shows that our theatrical workers have been able to better exert the important role of drama as a weapon; it also shows that in order for drama to serve politics, to serve current tasks, and, currently, to serve the urban people's commune movement, what plays should theatrical workers write and what plays should they perform, and how should they make their theatrical work a component of the people's commune movement. From the performance of "Flowers Bloom Everywhere, Thousands of Homes Fragrant," we can at least get such enlightenment.

    舞台上的北京的变化
    ——看话剧“花开遍地万户香”想到的
    林陵
    从历史上说，北京是我们祖国很古老的城市，从解放后十年间日新月异的变化来说，新北京还是年轻的。现在，北京正经历着我国历史发展的人民公社运动的大时代。把时代的脉搏用戏剧的形式，迅速而生动地反映在舞台上，让历史的创造者坐在台下观看，既能看清自己所作所为的历史意义，又能鼓舞自己拿出更大的干劲继续为创造新历史而努力，这是戏剧工作的一个重要方面。
    看了北京人民艺术剧院演出的“花开遍地万户香”就有这种感觉。这是一出表现北京新变化的新戏。反映北京变化似乎是以北京命名的人民艺术剧院的主要剧目，从首都剧场的舞台上，我们看到过的有叙述清末、民初、直到解放前夜好几朝社会演变的“茶馆”，反映二十年代悲惨生活的“骆驼祥子”和三十年代新陈代谢的“北京人”，还有“龙须沟”表现了解放初期的新气象，“女店员”、“红大院”和“花开遍地万户香”表现了大跃进以来北京社会大变和人心大变的内在实质。
    街道居民组织起来，家庭妇女从烧饭、洗衣、缝衣、带孩子的繁琐工作中解放出来，办工厂，参加生产劳动，创造社会财富，进一步很自然地发展为城市人民公社，——这便是“花开遍地万户香”的主题。
    作者抓住了建立城市人民公社的最基本的环节——办工厂，组织生产劳动来描写公社化运动是非常正确的创作方法。妇女们创办制造玻璃器的街道工厂，从制造试管到制造安瓶，从掌握安瓶的生产到接受眼药水瓶的定货，用不断发展和持续跃进的过程，写出妇女们为了把一切服从于生产而把托儿所、幼儿园、食堂、洗衣房、缝纫社一一建立起来，使自己完全从家务劳动中解放出来。发展和跃进都伴随着思想斗争。思想斗争的形式是多样的。观众可以从各种不同类型的人的思想斗争中，看到自己的影子，因而也有助于解决自己的思想问题。
    勤俭办厂，把自己的生产服从于社会的需要，而不是单纯追求利润，为了使生产服从社会的需要，就必须克服思想上的和技术上的困难。“花开遍地万户香”就是在这一问题上展开了戏剧性的纠纷，由于党的正确领导，一切问题迎刃而解，结果便出现了遍地开花、万户传香的局面。戏剧始终以乐观的调子来表现这些矛盾和斗争，全剧充满了喜剧气氛。
    城市人民公社问题的一个主要部分是妇女解放问题。“女店员”反映了解决这一问题的一个方面，“红大院”反映的是问题解决的另一个方面，“花开遍地万户香”是更进一步地反映比较全面地解决这一问题。从这些戏里，从舞台上，我们不仅看出北京的变化，更重要的是我们看出妇女问题的具体解决，尤其重要的是看出新社会的基层组织——人民公社在城市里是怎样形成和发展的。戏剧能够迅速地、及时地反映这些问题，说明我们的戏剧工作者已经能够更好地发挥戏剧这一武器的重要作用；也说明，为了使戏剧能为政治服务，能为当前任务服务，在目前来说，能为城市人民公社运动服务，戏剧工作者应该写些什么戏和演些什么戏，并且应该怎样使自己的戏剧工作成为人民公社运动的一个组成部分。从“花开遍地万户香”的演出中，我们至少可以得到这样的启发。
