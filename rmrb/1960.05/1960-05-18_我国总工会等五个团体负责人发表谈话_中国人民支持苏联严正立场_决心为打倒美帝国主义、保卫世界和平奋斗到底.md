    Xinhua News Agency report: Liu Ningyi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Hu Yaobang, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China, Cai Chang, Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, and Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity, today issued statements respectively, firmly supporting the statement made by Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev on May 16.

    In their statements, they pointed out that Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Comrade Khrushchev’s severe condemnation on May 16 at the preliminary meeting of the Four-Power Summit of the U.S. aircraft's aggressive activities against the Soviet Union, and the demand that the U.S. government guarantee that it will not engage in such provocative activities again and should punish those responsible, is a completely reasonable and solemn stance, and the Chinese people express their firm support.

    In their statements, they pointed out: U.S. imperialism, under the cover of peace, is pursuing its policy of aggression and war, and has carried out a series of aggressive and war preparations activities. Recently, on the eve of the Four-Power Summit, it sent military aircraft to carry out provocative activities against the Soviet Union, which fully proves that the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism will not change. Khrushchev's solemn condemnation hit the sore spot of U.S. imperialism and tore off Eisenhower's mask. The people of the world must not harbor unrealistic illusions about imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism. Only by thoroughly exposing their aggressive activities and carrying out a resolute struggle can we defend world peace.

    In their statements, they expressed that the Chinese people will always stand with the Soviet people, constantly consolidate and develop the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people, and fight to the end to overthrow the common enemy of the people of the world, U.S. imperialism, and to defend world peace.

    我国总工会等五个团体负责人发表谈话
    中国人民支持苏联严正立场
    决心为打倒美帝国主义、保卫世界和平奋斗到底
    本报讯　据新华社消息：中华全国总工会主席刘宁一、中国共产主义青年团中央委员会第一书记胡耀邦、全国妇女联合会主席蔡畅、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若和中国亚非团结委员会主席廖承志今天分别发表谈话，坚决支持苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫5月16日发表的声明。
    他们在谈话中指出，苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫同志5月16日在四国首脑会议预备会议上严厉谴责美国飞机对苏联的侵略活动，要求美国政府保证不再进行这种挑衅活动，并且应惩罚对此负责的人员，这是完全合理的严正立场，中国人民表示坚决的支持。
    他们在谈话中指出：美帝国主义在和平的幌子掩护下推行它的侵略政策和战争政策，进行了一系列的侵略和扩军备战活动。最近，在四国首脑会议的前夕，更派军用飞机对苏联进行挑衅活动，这充分证明了美帝国主义的侵略性是不会改变的。赫鲁晓夫的严正的谴责，打中了美帝国主义的痛处，揭下了艾森豪威尔的假面具。全世界人民，对帝国主义特别是美帝国主义不能抱有不切实际的幻想，只有彻底揭露它们的侵略活动，并进行坚决的斗争，才能保卫世界和平。
    他们在谈话中表示，中国人民永远同苏联人民在一起，不断巩固和发展中苏人民牢不可破的友谊，为打倒全世界人民的共同敌人美帝国主义，为保卫世界和平奋斗到底。
