Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 21st Dispatch: Tokyo News: The Central Executive Committee of the Japanese Socialist Party held a meeting today, deciding that the Socialist Party's current struggle direction is to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet, dissolve the House of Representatives, and declare the new "Security Treaty" invalid.

The meeting decided to further develop the struggle to prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty" within the next month. The meeting also believed that Eishenhower's scheduled visit to Japan should not be welcomed.

This morning, representatives of the Socialist Party's local organizations held a rally in Tokyo, passing the current action policy. The policy stipulates that the Socialist Party will use the strength of its national party organization to expose the Kishi Nobusuke group's atrocities to the people, publicize the invalidity of the House of Representatives' vote, and mobilize local masses to launch protests.

The policy announced that the Socialist Party does not welcome Eisenhower's visit to Japan. If he comes to Japan, the Socialist Party will launch a mass movement demanding that the United States not ratify the new "Security Treaty."

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 20th Dispatch: Tokyo News: The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan held an emergency meeting of union chairmen this afternoon. The meeting issued a statement saying that the resolutions "passed" by the House of Representatives to extend the Diet session and the new "Security Treaty" are illegal and invalid.

The meeting decided to develop the struggle against the "Security Treaty" thus far into a large-scale struggle to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet and demand the dissolution of the Diet, and to launch the 17th unified action.

The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan also said in its statement that U.S. President Eisenhower is scheduled to visit Japan next month, "He will strengthen the military system of Japan and the United States and intensify international tensions, therefore, we express our protest."

The meeting also decided to hold a thirty-minute work-to-rule strike and workplace assembly at various workplaces on the 26th, demanding the dissolution of the Diet. At the same time, cooperate with the Socialist Party in various localities to hold truth report meetings to expose the Kishi Nobusuke group's despicable behavior, so that the number of people who have signed against the "Security Treaty" will increase from the 13 million collected so far to more than half of all voters – 25 million.

The National Federation of Industrial Organizations of Japan also issued a statement today, expressing opposition to the "passage" of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." The statement said, "We demand the dissolution of the Diet."

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 21st Dispatch: Tokyo News: The Japan Congress of Journalists issued a statement today, announcing that it does not recognize the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" forcibly "passed" by the Kishi Nobusuke group in the House of Representatives as legal, and demanded the immediate dissolution of the House of Representatives and the holding of new elections so that the people can decide on the new "Security Treaty."

The statement said that a Prime Minister like Kishi Nobusuke, who sacrifices the lives and property of the Japanese people to serve Eisenhower, does not represent the Japanese people and their interests.

The Japan Literary Arts Association also issued a statement condemning the Kishi Nobusuke government for forcibly "passing" the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." The statement of the Kansai Council Against the "Security Treaty" pointed out that the Kishi Nobusuke group used police violence to trample on the principles of Diet work, and the statement also demanded the immediate dissolution of the Diet.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 21st Dispatch: Tokyo News: Professor Senroku Uehara, one of the organizers of the Japan "Security Treaty Problem Research Association," and the other ten representatives of this research association issued a statement in Tokyo today, saying that the research association does not recognize the "passage" of the new "Security Treaty" by the House of Representatives as valid.

The statement continued, "We demand that the Kishi Nobusuke government resign collectively immediately."

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 20th Dispatch: Tokyo News: Japanese cultural and educational figures issued statements one after another today, strongly condemning the Kishi Nobusuke group for using violence to forcibly "pass" the ugly drama of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" in the House of Representatives and the arbitrary practice of extending the Diet session. At the same time, they demanded the dissolution of the Diet and the total resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke government.

The statement issued today by 63 professors and associate professors from Kyushu University and the statement issued today by the faculty of Saga University both demanded the dissolution of the Diet to solicit public opinion.

Political commentator Motozo Tōshima said in a talk that Kishi Nobusuke forcibly extended the Diet session and "ratified" the new "Security Treaty," especially by ending deliberations without discussion in the committee, "this has left a big stain on Japan's parliamentary history."

Commentator Yoko Matsuoka pointed out in a talk that bringing the police into the Diet and forcibly extending the Diet session to "pass" the new "Security Treaty" can only show the weakness of the Kishi Nobusuke government and the ruling party, and show that the government and the ruling party are afraid of the surge of public opinion against them. He said that in the future, we must mobilize more people to go around the Diet to demand the total resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 20th Dispatch: Tokyo News: The "Lawyers' Conference to Stop (Ratification) of the Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty'" composed of 1,500 Japanese jurists issued a statement today announcing that at the special committee of the House of Representatives on the new "Security Treaty" held last night, a motion of no confidence in the chairman of the special committee on the new "Security Treaty" was raised. According to parliamentary law, this motion should be given priority for review. However, the Liberal Democratic Party members of the committee said that the debate on the special committee on the new "Security Treaty" had ended, and disregarded this parliamentary law. As a result, this motion was not reviewed.

The statement said, "Moreover, the committee violated parliamentary rules. It did not review the more than ten million people's petitions, which should have been given priority."

The statement emphasized that, due to the above reasons, the report on the debate situation of the special committee on the new "Security Treaty" made by the chairman of the special committee on the new "Security Treaty" of the House of Representatives, Sageshiki Ozawa, at the plenary meeting this morning "is illegal" and "not a report at all," and the decision on the "Security Treaty" made by the plenary meeting based on this report is naturally invalid.

The statement concluded, "Therefore, the House of Councilors cannot begin debating the 'Security Treaty' issue, because this treaty was not passed by the House of Representatives from a legal point of view. As for the House of Representatives, it should be dissolved immediately and the issue submitted to the people for decision." This lawyers' conference also intends to file an administrative lawsuit, affirming that the vote on the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is invalid.

    据新华社21日讯　东京消息：日本社会党中央执行委员会今天举行会议，决定社会党目前的斗争方针是打倒岸信介内阁，解散众议院，申明新“安全条约”无效。
    会议决定要在今后一个月内进一步开展阻止批准新“安全条约”的斗争。会议还认为，对艾森豪威尔预定到日本的访问不能表示欢迎。
    今天上午，社会党地方组织代表在东京举行了奋起大会，通过了当前的活动方针。方针规定，社会党将以全国党组织的力量向人民揭露岸信介集团的暴行，宣传众议院的表决无效，并将动员地方群众展开抗议运动。
    方针宣布，社会党不欢迎艾森豪威尔访问日本。如果他前来日本，社会党将展开群众运动，要求美国不要批准新“安全条约”。
    据新华社20日讯　东京消息：日本工会总评议会今天下午举行各工会委员长紧急会议，会议发表声明说，众议院“通过”的延长国会会期和新“安全条约”的决议是非法的，都是无效的。
    会议决定，把迄今为止的反对“安全条约”的斗争发展为打倒岸信介内阁和要求解散国会的大规模斗争，并展开第十七次统一行动。
    日本工会总评议会在声明中还说，美国总统艾森豪威尔预定在下月访问日本，“他将会加强日本和美国的军事体制，加剧国际紧张局势，因此，我们表示抗议”。
    会议还决定将于26日在各种工作场所举行历时三十分钟的定时罢工和工作场所大会，要求解散国会。同时，在各地同社会党合作，举行真相报告会，揭露岸信介集团的卑鄙行为，使签名反对“安全条约”的人数由迄今为止所征集到的一千三百万人增加到占全体选民的过半数——两千五百万人。
    日本全国产业别工会联合会今天也发表声明，表示反对日美“安全条约”的“通过”。声明说，我们要求解散国会。
    据新华社21日讯　东京消息：日本记者会议今天发表声明，宣布它不承认岸信介集团在众议院强行“通过”的新日美“安全条约”是合法的，并要求立即解散众议院，举行新的选举，由人民对新“安全条约”作出裁决。
    声明说，像岸信介这样一个牺牲日本人民的生命和财产为艾森豪威尔效劳的首相并不代表日本人民和他们的利益。
    日本文艺界协会也都发表了声明，谴责岸信介政府强行“通过”新日美“安全条约”。关西反对“安全条约”恳谈会的声明指出，岸信介集团利用警察暴力，蹂躏了国会工作的原则，声明并且要求立即解散国会。
    据新华社21日讯　东京消息：日本“安全条约问题研究会”组织者之一上原专禄教授和这个研究会的其他十位代表今天在东京发表声明说，研究会不承认众议院对新“安全条约”的“通过”是有效的。
    声明接着说，“我们要求岸信介政府立即集体辞职。”
    据新华社20日讯　东京消息：日本文教界人士今天纷纷发表声明，强烈谴责岸信介集团使用暴力强行在众议院“通过”新日美“安全条约”的丑剧和延长国会会期的横蛮作法，同时要求解散国会，要求岸信介政府总辞职。
    日本九州大学的教授和副教授六十三人今天发表的声明和佐贺大学教授团今天发表的声明，都要求解散国会，以征询民意。
    政治评论家唐岛基智三发表谈话说，岸信介强行延长国会会期和“批准”新“安全条约”，特别是在委员会上没有经过讨论就结束审议，“这给日本的议会史留下了很大的污点”。
    评论家松冈洋子在谈话中指出，把警察调进国会，用暴力强行延长国会会期，“通过”新“安全条约”，这只能说明岸信介政府和执政党的虚弱，说明政府和执政党害怕反对他们的舆论的高涨。他说，今后我们要动员更多的人到国会周围去，要求岸信介内阁总辞职。
    据新华社20日讯　东京消息：由一千五百名日本法学家组成的“阻止（批准）日美‘安全条约’法律家会议”今天发表声明宣布，在昨晚举行的众议院新“安全条约”特别委员会上，有人提出了对新“安全条约”特别委员会委员长不信任的动议。根据议会法，这个动议应当优先予以审查。但是委员会的自由民主党委员说新“安全条约”特别委员会的辩论已经结束，而无视这个议会法。结果这个动议没有被审查。
    声明说，“况且委员会破坏了议会规则。它不去审查数目超过一千万份的人民请愿书，而这些请愿书是应该优先审查的。”
    声明强调指出，由于上述的原因，众议院新“安全条约”特别委员会委员长小泽佐重喜今天早晨在全体会议上所作的关于新“安全条约”特别委员会辩论情况的报告“是非法的”，“根本不是什么报告”，全体会议根据这个报告所作的关于“安全条约”的决定自然是无效的。
    声明最后说，“因此，参议院不能开始辩论‘安全条约’问题，因为这个条约不是由众议院根据法律的观点通过的。至于众议院，它应当立即解散，把问题提交人民决定。”这个法律学家会议还准备提出行政诉讼，肯定对新日美“安全条约”的表决是无效的。（附图片）
