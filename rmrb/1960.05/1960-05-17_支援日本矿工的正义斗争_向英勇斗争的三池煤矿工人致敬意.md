    Support the Just Struggle of Japanese Miners
    Pay Tribute to the Heroic Struggle of the Miike Coal Mine Workers

Dear Japanese miner brothers:

    The new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" signed recently by U.S. imperialism and the Nobusuke Kishi clique is an aggressive military alliance treaty hostile to China, the Soviet Union, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the peoples of Asian countries. The U.S.-Japanese reactionaries vainly attempt to revive Japanese militarism through this treaty, drag the Japanese people into the vortex of war once again, and realize the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries' sinister aggressive plans.

    Chinese workers, who have suffered severe disasters from Japanese imperialist aggression, express great indignation and firm opposition to this treaty. The Chinese people love peace. We never invade others, but we will never allow others to invade us. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, we defeated Japanese imperialism, and on the Korean battlefield, we severely punished the most ferocious enemy of the people of the world—U.S. imperialism. If the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries insist on the path of aggression and war, then Tojo Hideki and Hitler's fate will be their fate.

    You coal miners and all workers, along with the entire Japanese people, are launching a massive action to smash this treaty, and the Miike coal miners, in order to oppose the Mitsui Zaibatsu's layoffs and the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, have persisted in a heroic struggle for eight months despite the Kishi Nobusuke government's bloody suppression. We pay the highest tribute to your ongoing anti-American patriotic and just struggle and to the struggle of the Miike coal miners, and we firmly support your struggle.

    The liberated Chinese workers will support you with outstanding achievements in the Great Leap Forward of socialist construction. We have completed the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule, and in the entire 1960s to come, we will continue to leap forward. We must work hard to produce more coal to strengthen the power of our working class and all peace-loving and democratic people worldwide.

    Dear Japanese coal miners and all worker brothers, you are by no means isolated in your struggle. The powerful Chinese working class is your reliable backing. Now, the volcanoes under the feet of U.S. imperialism are erupting one after another. The workers and people of Japan, the people of South Korea, the people of Turkey, and the people of Latin America have all risen up one after another to launch heroic struggles for national independence, for democracy, freedom, and peace. The workers and people of all countries are tightening the noose around the neck of U.S. imperialism.

    We wish the Japanese workers victory in their struggle for Japan's independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality.

    With the highest proletarian
      Salute
                                    All Workers of Mentougou Coal Mine, Beijing

### 支援日本矿工的正义斗争  向英勇斗争的三池煤矿工人致敬意

    支援日本矿工的正义斗争
    向英勇斗争的三池煤矿工人致敬意亲爱的日本矿工兄弟们：
    最近美帝国主义和岸信介集团所签订的新日美“安全条约”，是一项敌视中国、苏联、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国以及亚洲各国人民的侵略性的军事同盟条约。美日反动派妄想通过这一条约，重新复活日本军国主义，把日本人民再一次拖入战争的漩涡，实现美日反动派的罪恶的侵略计划。
    曾经遭受过日本帝国主义侵略严重灾害的中国工人对于这个条约表示极大的愤慨和坚决反对。中国人民是热爱和平的，我们从不侵略别人，但是也决不允许别人来侵略我们。在抗日战争时期，我们打败了日本帝国主义，在朝鲜战场上又严厉地惩罚了世界人民最凶恶的敌人——美帝国主义。美日反动派如果坚持侵略和战争的道路，那末，东条英机和希特勒的下场就是它们的下场。
    你们煤矿工人和全体工人正在和全体日本人民一道，为粉碎这一条约展开了声势浩大的行动，而三池煤矿工人为了反对三井财阀解雇、反对日美军事同盟条约，不顾岸信介政府血腥镇压坚持了八个月的英勇斗争。我们对你们正在进行的反美爱国正义斗争、对于三池煤矿工人的斗争致以最崇高的敬意，并且坚决支持你们的斗争。
    解放了的中国工人要用社会主义建设大跃进中的出色成绩来支援你们，我们已经提前三年完成了第二个五年计划，在今后的整个六十年代中，我们还将继续跃进。我们要努力生产，增产煤炭来加强我们全世界工人阶级和一切爱好和平民主的人民的力量。
    亲爱的日本煤矿工人和全体工人弟兄们，你们在斗争中绝不是孤立的，强大的中国工人阶级是你们可靠的后盾。现在美帝国主义脚下的火山一个一个地相继爆发了，日本的工人和全体人民，南朝鲜的人民，土耳其的人民和拉丁美洲的人民都相继起来为争取民族独立，争取民主、自由、和平而展开英勇的斗争，各国工人和人民把套在美帝国主义脖子上的绞索越勒越紧了。
    祝日本工人为争取日本的独立、民主、和平和中立的斗争取得胜利。
    致以最崇高的工人阶级的
      敬礼
                                    北京门头沟煤矿全体工人
