Xinhua News Agency Dispatch:

Overseas Chinese, returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and returned overseas Chinese students in Beijing held a gathering at the Beijing Exhibition Center Theater on the morning of April 30 to celebrate the "May Day" International Labor Day.

Participating in the celebration were over 2,700 people, including overseas Chinese and compatriots from Hong Kong and Macau who came to Beijing to participate in the "May Day" celebrations, as well as returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and returned overseas Chinese students from twenty-three provinces, cities, and autonomous regions.

Liao Chengzhi, Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, spoke at the meeting, first extending holiday greetings to the attending overseas Chinese. Then, he discussed the current international situation and China's overseas Chinese affairs policy. He said that our overseas Chinese affairs policy remains the same as before. As long as influential groups in Indonesia do not change their policy of repelling overseas Chinese, our practice of transporting overseas Chinese back to China will not change now or in the future. The strong socialist motherland, which has already stood up, has the strength to protect the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese abroad. He also said that in the past, during the national democratic revolution, overseas Chinese provided great assistance to the motherland, and they have also given the motherland due support in economic recovery and socialist construction. The people of the motherland will not forget these contributions. Finally, he encouraged overseas Chinese abroad to help each other and strengthen patriotic unity.

Deng Lianhua, a "Three Good" student from the Beijing Returned Overseas Chinese Students Supplementary School, Huang Buyun, a returned overseas Chinese from Malaya who attended the National Congress of Heroes, and Liao Shilong, a returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia who returned to the motherland only three months ago, spoke at the meeting one after another, recounting their achievements in work and study, and expressing their gratitude to the motherland for its protection and care for overseas Chinese. They expressed their determination to work hard and study diligently in the future to repay the motherland's deep kindness.

Fang Fang and Zhuang Mingli, Deputy Directors of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, and Cai Tingkai and other members, as well as You Yangzu, Wang Yuanxing, and Chen Qiyuan, Vice Chairmen of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, also attended today's celebration. After the meeting, a wonderful cultural program was performed.
