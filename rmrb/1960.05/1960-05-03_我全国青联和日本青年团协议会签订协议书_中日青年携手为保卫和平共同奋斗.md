Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch: The All-China Youth Federation and the Japan Youth Organization Council signed an agreement this afternoon.

Signing the agreement were: Zhang Chao, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Youth Federation, and Shoichi Mano, Chairman of the Japan Youth Organization Council.

Present at the signing ceremony were: Qian Dawei, Deputy Director of the International Liaison Department of the All-China Youth Federation, and Yujiro Matsuzaki, Secretary to Shoichi Mano, Chairman of the Japan Youth Organization Council.

The full text of the agreement is as follows:

The All-China Youth Federation welcomes Shoichi Mano, Chairman of the Japan Youth Organization Council, to China to discuss matters of exchange between the two organizations. Chairman Shoichi Mano expressed his gratitude for this. During his stay in Beijing, Chairman Shoichi Mano and Vice-Chairman Zhang Chao, representative of the All-China Youth Federation, frankly exchanged views on issues of common concern in a friendly atmosphere. Both sides believe that developing friendly relations between Chinese and Japanese youth is the common aspiration of the youth of both countries, and that the youth of both countries should join hands and work together to defend peace in the Far East and the world.

Chairman Shoichi Mano introduced the efforts made by the Japan Youth Organization Council to safeguard peace, ban atomic and hydrogen bombs, recover Okinawa, prevent the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," and restore diplomatic relations between China and Japan. Vice-Chairman Zhang Chao, on behalf of the Chinese youth, expressed sympathy and support for this, and expressed his belief that the heroic struggle launched by the Japanese youth together with the Japanese people against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" will surely be victorious.

In order to develop friendly exchanges between the youth of the two countries, Vice-Chairman Zhang Chao pointed out that it is necessary to eliminate the anti-China policy of the Nobusuke Kishi government and oppose the conspiracy to create "two Chinas." Chairman Shoichi Mano stated that the Japan Youth Organization Council will urge the Japanese government to change this reactionary policy and confirmed that the All-China Youth Federation is the only genuine Chinese youth organization, that there is only one China, and that Taiwan is an inseparable part of the People's Republic of China. Vice-Chairman Zhang Chao expressed regret over the visit of the delegation of the Japan Youth Organization Council to Taiwan, and Chairman Shoichi Mano guaranteed that such incidents would not occur again in the future.

In order to develop friendly exchanges between the two organizations, the All-China Youth Federation invited the Japan Youth Organization Council to send a delegation to visit China in the second half of this year. Chairman Shoichi Mano, on behalf of the Japan Youth Organization Council, invited the All-China Youth Federation to send a delegation to visit Japan. Vice-Chairman Zhang Chao stated that after an atmosphere suitable for the visit emerges in Japan, the All-China Youth Federation can consider sending a delegation to visit Japan at an appropriate time.
