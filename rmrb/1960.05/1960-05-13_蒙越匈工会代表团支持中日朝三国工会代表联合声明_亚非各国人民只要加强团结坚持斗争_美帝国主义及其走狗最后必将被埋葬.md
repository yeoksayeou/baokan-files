Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 11th: The trade union delegations from Mongolia, Vietnam, and Hungary, in a conversation with Xinhua reporters in Wuhan on the 9th, expressed their warm support for the joint statement issued on May 2nd by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, and the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea.

The Mongolian trade union delegation pointed out that the "Security Treaty" signed by U.S. imperialism in collusion with the reactionary Kishi Nobusuke government is not only a military alliance hostile to the people of China, the Soviet Union, and Korea, but also threatens the security of the Mongolian people and other Asian countries. The delegation expressed its firm support for the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan's unified national action in uniting all workers to oppose the U.S.-Japan military alliance. The delegation said that U.S. imperialism is fostering fascist rule and establishing military bases in southern Korea and southern Vietnam, threatening peace in Asia, and the entire people and workers of Mongolia express their firm opposition. U.S. imperialism must get out of southern Korea and southern Vietnam to realize the unification of southern and northern Korea and the unification of southern and northern Vietnam. The delegation, on behalf of the Mongolian people and workers, warmly supports the just anti-imperialist and patriotic struggle of the people of southern Korea and southern Vietnam, and supports the national independence movements of the people of Asia and Africa.

The Vietnamese General Confederation of Labor delegation stated that the joint statement of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, and the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea not only encouraged the fighting will of the people of all countries against imperialism, but also powerfully encouraged the struggle of the people of Asia and Africa against colonialism and for national independence. The delegation pointed out that the Vietnamese workers and people, who have suffered deeply from the aggression of Japanese militarism, understand the seriousness of U.S. imperialism's revival of Japanese militarism and the creation of war plots in the Pacific region. The Vietnamese workers and people are extremely angry at the Kishi Nobusuke reactionary government's unilateral war reparations to the Ngo Dinh Diem traitorous clique in order to realize U.S. imperialism's conspiracy to turn southern Vietnam into a colony. The struggle of the Japanese workers and people against the U.S.-Japan military alliance has powerfully supported the struggle of the Vietnamese people against U.S. imperialism and its lackey, the Ngo Dinh Diem traitorous clique. The delegation also pointed out that U.S. imperialism's occupation of South Korea and the Syngman Rhee traitorous clique's bloody rule over the South Korean people have angered the people of southern Korea, and the Korean people will eventually drive U.S. imperialism out; similarly, the people of southern Vietnam, with the support of the people of all countries, will inevitably end the evil rule of U.S. imperialism and its lackey, the Ngo Dinh Diem traitorous clique.

The Vietnamese General Confederation of Labor delegation expressed its deep conviction in its statement that in the era when the East wind prevails over the West wind, as long as the workers and people of Asia and Africa further strengthen unity, support each other, and carry the anti-imperialist patriotic struggle and the struggle for national independence through to the end, U.S. imperialism and its lackeys will inevitably be burned to ashes by the flames of the people's struggle.

The Hungarian trade union delegation stated in its conversation, that the joint statement issued by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the General Council of Trade unions of Japan, and General federation of Trade Unions of Korean has contributed to the struggle of international proletariat uniting the people of all countries against U.S. imperialism. The delegation expressed its support for the heroic struggle of the Korean people for the reunification of their motherland, the struggle of the Japanese people against the U.S.-Japan military alliance, and the national independence struggles of the people of Asia and Africa.

The trade union delegations from Mongolia and other three countries made the above remarks to the reporter of this agency during their visit in Wuhan after their participation in the "May Day" celebration activities in Beijing.

    蒙古工会代表团指出，美帝国主义勾结岸信介反动政府签订的“安全条约”，不仅是敌视中国、苏联、朝鲜人民的军事同盟，同时也威胁着蒙古人民同亚洲各国的安全。代表团对日本工会总评议会团结全体工人进行反对日美军事同盟的全国统一行动，表示坚决支持。代表团说，美帝国主义在朝鲜南部、越南南部扶植法西斯统治，建立军事基地，威胁亚洲和平，蒙古全体人民和工人表示坚决反对。美帝国主义必须从朝鲜南部、越南南部滚出去，实现朝鲜南部和北部的统一，越南南部和北部的统一。代表团代表蒙古人民和工人热烈支持朝鲜南部、越南南部人民反帝爱国的正义斗争，支持亚非各国人民的民族独立运动。
    越南总工会代表团发表谈话说，中华全国总工会、日本工会总评议会、朝鲜职业总同盟的联合声明，不仅鼓舞了各国人民反对帝国主义的斗争意志，也有力地鼓舞了亚非各国人民反对殖民主义、争取民族独立的斗争。代表团指出，深受日本军国主义侵略灾难的越南工人和人民，懂得美帝国主义复活日本军国主义，在太平洋地区制造战争阴谋的严重性。越南工人和人民，对岸信介反动政府单方面给吴庭艳卖国集团战争赔偿，以实现美帝国主义把越南南部变成殖民地的阴谋，表示万分愤怒。日本工人和人民反对美日军事同盟的斗争，有力地支持了越南人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗吴庭艳卖国集团的斗争。代表团还指出，美帝国主义侵占南朝鲜和李承晚卖国集团对南朝鲜人民的血腥统治，激怒了朝鲜南部人民，朝鲜人民最后必然会把美帝国主义赶出去；同样，越南南部人民在各国人民的支持下，也必然会结束美帝国主义及其走狗吴庭艳卖国集团的罪恶统治。
    越南总工会代表团在谈话中表示深信，在东风压倒西风的时代，亚非各国工人和人民只要进一步加强团结，互相支援，把反帝爱国斗争和争取民族独立的斗争进行到底，美帝国主义及其走狗必将最后被人民斗争的烈火烧得一干二净。
