Harnessing Water, Governing Mountains, and Managing Soil: Transforming Nature
Hu Jizong, Secretary of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

In recent years, particularly since last winter, the movement of harnessing water, governing mountains, and managing soil has seen new development in Hunan Province. Its characteristics are: the integration of water management, mountain governance, and soil management, comprehensive treatment; comprehensive development, comprehensive utilization; grand scale, rapid progress.

Last winter and this spring, more than six million laborers and 300,000 cadres across the province went to water conservancy construction sites, with the heroic spirit of "moving thousands of mountains and opening ten thousand miles of rivers," opening mountains and splitting ridges, damming rivers, and building canals around mountains, diverting water up the mountains. In one winter and spring, more than 30,000 new reservoirs were built, including more than 1,000 reservoirs with dam heights of 15 meters or more; a total of 1.1 billion cubic meters of earth and stone were completed, equivalent to half of the total earth and stone work completed in the past ten years of water management. Genetically treating Wang River in Changde County, comprehensively treating Wei River in Ningxiang County, comprehensively utilizing water sources in Hengyang County, and comprehensively treating the main and tributary streams of Lian River in Lianyuan County, these projects have achieved comprehensive utilization effects, and are typical examples of comprehensive development and comprehensive management. The mountain governance movement of large-scale afforestation and large forest creation adopted the method of large corps land preparation and professional team afforestation, combined with water and soil management, and successfully completed the afforestation task. At the same time, the phenomenon of adapting to local conditions, concentrating in connected areas, and creating large areas of forests has become relatively common, with 333 locations in the province creating large forests of more than 10,000 mu. The Wuxingling Forest Farm in Lingling fully implemented the method of preparing land on the horizontal contour belts around the mountain, forming neat terraced forest belts, effectively maintaining water and soil. Most parts of the province have implemented full reclamation of land for grain and forest intercropping, which can both increase agricultural income and accelerate the growth of trees. The soil management movement of reclaiming wasteland and improving soil is combined with water and mountain management. Last winter and this spring, the province newly opened 5 to 6 million mu of wasteland. In Pingjiang County, 130,000 people went up the mountains, fought hard for ten days, and reclaimed 250,000 mu of wasteland, of which more than 100,000 mu were made into terraced fields. More than 10 million mu of low-yield fields in the province have been improved by taking measures such as opening ditches to drain water, mixing soil with sand, and increasing fertilizer, improving more than 4 million mu. In some parts of Changde, Shaoyang, and Xiangtan, small hills were merged into large hills, land was leveled, and work was carried out to achieve field and river network patterns. The great achievements of the "three managements" movement last winter and this spring have not only increased favorable conditions for the development of agricultural production, but also played a great role in changing people's mental outlook. More and more people are unwilling to be bound and manipulated by nature, but want to be the masters of nature.

Large-scale water management, mountain governance, and soil management, transforming nature, this is only the beginning, and more arduous, greater, and more glorious tasks are yet to come. The total area of Hunan Province is more than 200,000 square kilometers, with more than 307 million mu of land. The current distribution of mountains, water, and soil is roughly "70% mountains, 10% water, and 20% farmland." The province has 37 million people, but only has more than 56 million mu of cultivated land, with an average of only about 1.5 mu per person, which is not compatible with the requirements for rapid growth in agricultural production. Our province has abundant labor resources and the strength to operate more cultivated land; in mountainous areas, hilly areas, and lake areas, there are a large amount of reclaimable wasteland, which is estimated to be more than 30 million mu according to preliminary surveys. Rapidly reclaiming these reclaimable wasteland is an extremely important step to accelerate grain production increase, solve the competition between economic crops and grain for land, and between feed crops and grain for land. The province has more than 200 million mu of mountainous area, but only about 100 million mu of forest land, and many of them are sparse forest land. It requires great efforts to green all the barren hills. In the mountains of Mufu Mountain, Wanyang Mountain, Nanling, Xuefeng Mountain, and Wuling Mountain, there are not only extremely rich forest resources, but also abundant oil, medicinal materials, spices, wild fibers, wild starch, chemical raw materials, mushrooms, and fungus, etc. At present, the total timber storage in the province is more than 200 million cubic meters, and the annual allowable cut should be about 20 million cubic meters, but our actual annual felling volume is only 5 to 6 million cubic meters. According to a survey in Chengbu County in 1959, the amount of mountain product harvesting only reached one-tenth of the amount that should be harvested. We must make every effort to quickly make these valuable materials serve socialist construction. Hunan's water resources are extremely rich. The main and tributaries of the four major water systems of Xiang, Zi, Yuan, and Li originate from the remote mountainous areas of southern Hunan, western Hunan, and eastern Hunan, and converge into Dongting Lake in northern Hunan. The tributaries of the four rivers, with a flow rate of more than five cubic meters per second and a drainage area of more than 100 square kilometers, total as many as 562, with a total length of more than 30,000 li. In addition, there are countless streams, forming a natural water network. Most of these waters are clear and flow continuously throughout the four seasons. It is estimated that the water energy reserves are more than 18 million kilowatts. In the ten years since liberation, especially in the past two years, great achievements have been made in building reservoirs and dams to control water flow and comprehensively utilize water power. However, the area of the basin we control only reaches about 10%, and most of the water in the province has not yet been controlled and utilized. Hunan's natural climate has uneven rainfall distribution, and the rainfall in April, May, and June generally accounts for more than 50% of the annual rainfall. Between spring and summer, there are mountain floods in mountainous areas, waterlogged fields in central Hunan, and waterlogging and floods in lake areas. Every year, at least 2 to 3 million mu of fertile land suffer from flood damage. The rainfall in July and August is generally less than the evaporation, and more than 10 million mu of farmland suffer from drought every year. We must basically control the water in Hunan, so that it obeys people's dispatch and benefits mankind, and there is still arduous work to be done.

The excellent situation of socialist economic construction urgently requires the "three managements" movement in our province to develop in a higher direction. Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy, and accelerating the development of agriculture is the central link in the high-speed and proportionate development of our province's national economy. To rapidly improve the production level of agriculture, it is still far from enough to rely solely on increasing the yield per unit area, relying solely on existing cultivated land and developed mountainous areas and water conservancy projects, it is necessary to actively develop new resources and increase new production objects. Therefore, in the last three years of the second five-year plan, the focus of our water management, mountain governance, and soil management to transform nature must be to vigorously reclaim wasteland, expand cultivated land area; develop mountainous areas, increase social wealth; develop water conservancy, and serve socialist construction.

Water management, mountain governance, and soil management must be combined with each other in order to achieve the goal of "comprehensive management, comprehensive development, and comprehensive utilization." This idea must be consistently implemented in making plans and taking various measures.

The province needs to add 30 million mu of cultivated land within three years, and strive to make all of them mature soil and mature fields in 1962. This requires striving to reclaim 30 million mu of wasteland this winter and next spring, and strive to do one mu of reclamation and one mu of land preparation, one mu of land preparation and one mu of planting, and one mu of planting and one mu of management. After one year of processing, sorting, and cultivating the soil in these newly opened lands next year, the cultivated land area in the province can reach more than 80 million mu in the spring of 1962, and the great development of agricultural production will be more guaranteed. Counties, communes, brigades, production teams, and even work groups should organize forces, rely on the masses, and immediately start a general survey to make a comprehensive reclamation plan for all the barren hills, wastelands, and barren islands that can be turned into cultivated land, and reclaim them in stages and batches. Reclamation must be combined with soil and water conservation, and each mountain should be measured and a specific plan should be made according to the terrain. Counties and communes can conduct planning pilots, create models, hold on-site meetings, and promote them comprehensively. If it is possible to create terraced fields at one time, it is best to create terraced fields at one time; if it is not possible to create terraced fields at one time, parallel grass belts around the mountain should be left, or horizontal ditches around the mountain should be dug. This is not only conducive to soil and water conservation at present, but also facilitates further changing slope soil into terraced soil. The places that have been fully reclaimed as slope soil last winter and this spring must also seize the time, after measurement and planning, organize forces to dig out the horizontal ditches to prevent soil erosion. A large part of the existing dry land is vertically cultivated slope soil, which is very unfavorable for soil and water conservation. This situation should be changed quickly, and slope soil should be turned into terraced soil, and vertical cultivation should be changed to horizontal cultivation. With the further development of the water management movement, we must vigorously carry out the work of changing dry land to paddy fields, and strive to make the paddy field area in the province reach more than 50 million mu by 1962, an increase of about 10 million mu compared with the existing paddy fields, and at the same time convert more than 10 million mu of dry land into irrigated land. Transforming low-yield fields is an extremely important measure to increase production. A specific analysis must be made of the fields with low yields, and different measures should be taken according to different situations to solve the problem. Cold soaking fields, open ditches to drain water, warm water irrigation; excessive water fields, build excessive water channels to prevent excessive water from taking away silt and fertilizer; fields with poor soil quality, pick guest soil mixed with sand and mud, increase fertilizer, and improve the soil. In short, we must make every effort to completely transform all low-yield fields within three years. In the lake area and plain area, from this winter, we must carry out the work of merging small hills into large hills in a planned and step-by-step manner, and gradually realize gardenization and river networkization.

Developing mountainous areas and developing the economy of mountainous areas, the main difficulties are inconvenient transportation and insufficient labor force, and many valuable materials cannot be transported out. Therefore, developing mountainous areas and building mountainous areas, in addition to a few places with very few people and a lot of land, it is necessary to transfer some labor from other places to the mountains. A more important issue is to actively build rivers and roads to improve transportation conditions, and try to collect and transport the rich local and special products in the mountainous areas as much as possible; In this way, on the one hand, it can meet the needs of the comprehensive leap forward in the country's socialist construction, and on the other hand, it can rapidly prosper the economy of the mountainous areas, improve the living standards of the people in the mountainous areas, achieve the goal of raising mountains with mountains, and build mountainous areas faster and better. In addition, we must continue to carry out the mountain management movement of "large-scale afforestation and large-scale forest creation." According to the topography of Hunan Province, the forest land area of the province should be about 160 million mu, accounting for about 50% of the total area of the province. The afforestation plan must be closely combined with the water and soil management plan. All barren hills that can be reclaimed for cultivated land should be included in the reclamation plan. Based on the different conditions of the height, slope, and soil quality of the mountains, a utilization plan should be made for each mountain from the top of the mountain to the hillside to the foot of the mountain. Generally, timber forests are created in distant mountains, and economic forests are created in nearby mountains; timber forests are created at the top of the mountains, economic forests are created on the hillside; and cultivated land is reclaimed at the foot of the mountains and in places with small slopes. In hilly areas, lake areas, and areas with severe soil erosion, in addition to vigorously creating timber forests and economic forests and striving for timber self-sufficiency, windbreak forests, wave-proof forests, water source forests, sand-fixing forests, and fuel forests should also be created according to local conditions. The afforestation plan should pay attention to the appropriate concentration of various forests in connected areas, such as creating large areas of chestnut forests, walnut forests, Chinese tallow trees, Phyllostachys pubescens forests, etc., which is not only convenient for current management, but also lays a favorable foundation for future mechanized production and centralized processing. It is estimated that by 1962, timber forests in Hunan Province can reach 100 million mu, Phyllostachys pubescens 10 million mu, Camellia oleifera 20 million mu, Tung tree 10 million mu, and other economic forests 10 million mu. At the same time, we strive to plant trees on all suitable barren hills before 1962, and strengthen the cultivation and management of existing forest land, replant sparse forest land, and vigorously carry out grain and forest intercropping to give full play to the land's fertility.

The "water management" work, while solving flood control and irrigation, should pay great attention to solving the problems of transportation and water energy utilization. This requires a comprehensive watershed planning, starting from a distance, focusing on storage, focusing on community-run, combining upstream and downstream management, coordinating tributaries and main streams, making large, medium, and small projects complete sets, and emphasizing comprehensive benefits. Water management should start from the source, and in mountainous areas where water storage and irrigation are needed, reservoirs should be built, dams should be built across rivers, and canals should be built to divert water to irrigate fields. Even in places where water storage and irrigation are not needed, in order to solve mountain transportation and water damage in the middle and lower reaches, dams should be built layer by layer on streams, and earthen dams, stone dams, firewood dams, wooden dams, and cement dams should be built on a large scale, combining local and foreign methods, and striving to store water in the mountains. This can not only reduce the water level difference between the flood season and the dry season in the lower reaches, but especially facilitate the transportation and utilization of water energy to process agricultural and sideline products in mountainous areas. Even if there is only one flow rate or less than one flow rate, as long as the water is blocked and stored, and the water is discharged regularly, a large amount of timber and local products in the mountainous area can be transported out, which is much more economical, faster, better, and more quantity than carrying on the back and shoulder, and land transportation. At the same time, a large amount of water energy can be used. There are so many benefits, why not do it? All mountainous counties and communities in Hunan Province strive to basically control more than 50% of the local watershed area by 1962, so that the total water storage capacity in the province can reach more than 40 billion cubic meters, basically eliminating water and drought disasters, and all qualified communities and teams can also build hydropower stations or hydropower stations. In the Dongting Lake area, the terrain is flat, and we should actively realize the river network, which is not only conducive to irrigation and drainage, but also facilitates field transportation; at the same time, we must actively reclaim barren islands, expand cultivated land, and use large areas of inland lakes to vigorously develop aquaculture. In short, whether it is mountainous areas, hilly areas, or lake areas, plans should be made according to local conditions, and water resources should be actively developed and comprehensively utilized.

Carrying out large-scale agricultural infrastructure construction such as land reclamation, river construction, dam construction, highway construction, and mountain afforestation, we must combine hard work, practical work, and skillful work: concentrate the wisdom of the broad masses, carry out inventions and creations, promote advanced technical measures, vigorously carry out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on tool reform, focus on soil, combine local and foreign methods, and achieve semi-mechanization and mechanization as soon as possible in the main labor process to improve work efficiency and reduce labor intensity. In Guzhang and Yongshun in western Hunan, many places have created mountain plows and used cattle plows for reclamation. One person and one cow can reclaim more than one mu of land per day, which increases work efficiency by two or three times compared with manual digging. This is a good method that can be universally adopted. Hengshan County has carried out the "five dragons" movement of tool reform in field operations, short-distance transportation, animal husbandry, agricultural and sideline product processing, and life services, which has greatly improved work efficiency, not only completed the task of water conservancy construction ahead of schedule, and prepared for spring plowing early, but also reduced labor intensity, improved the quality of work, and made the members have work and leisure, and their enthusiasm for production has become greater. In the movement of water management, mountain governance, and soil management, actively creating, trial-producing, appraising, and promoting new tools and new measures in various aspects is an extremely important task that leaders at all levels must pay attention to.

Developing mountainous areas and reclaiming wasteland must be carried out simultaneously with on-site development and expeditionary development. According to the different sizes of wasteland areas, it is determined that production teams should reclaim on the spot, or communes should run agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry farms for reclamation. For large areas of barren hills and wastelands that people's communes cannot afford to reclaim, the state will run reclamation farms for reclamation. The relatively concentrated wasteland reclaimed by production teams can establish new production teams or work groups, and adopt the method of residential areas, pig farms, and agricultural and sideline product processing plants all going to the mountains for on-site reclamation. Small pieces of reclaimable wasteland can be reclaimed by the production team on the spot.

To transform the appearance of the earth, we must transform people's hearts. Carrying out the "three managements" movement and changing the appearance of mountains and rivers is a revolution against nature, but first we must have a correct understanding, so that we can actively think of ways and have greater enthusiasm. If we do not change those incorrect ideas, and cannot establish lofty ambitions, break superstitions, then it will be "full of difficulties, this is impossible, and that is impossible." Water management, mountain governance, and soil management, such a great cause of building socialism, cannot be achieved without the conscious and active actions of the broad masses. Therefore, the whole party must be mobilized, go deep into mobilizing the masses, further arouse the labor enthusiasm of the broad cadres and masses to build socialism, muster up soaring energy, and launch a vigorous mass reclamation movement throughout the province after rice transplanting this spring and this winter and next spring, and strive to complete the task of reclaiming 30 million mu of land this winter and next spring, and use this to drive the water management, mountain governance, and soil management movement to develop in a higher direction, and build our province more prosperous and more beautiful.

    治水治山治土　改造自然
    中共湖南省委书记　胡继宗
    几年来，特别是去年冬季以来，湖南省广大人民治水治山治土运动有了新的发展，它的特点是：治水治山治土相互结合，综合治理；全面开发，综合利用；规模宏伟，进展迅速。
    去冬今春，全省有六百多万劳动大军，三十多万干部走上水利工地，以“移山千座，开河万里”的英雄气概，开山劈岭，拦河筑坝，环山开渠，引水上山。一个冬春，新建水库三万多座，其中坝高十五米以上的水库一千多座；共完成十一亿土石方，相当于过去十年治水完成土石方总和的一半。常德县根治枉水，宁乡县综合治理沩水，衡阳县综合利用水源，涟源县全面治理涟水的干支流，这些工程都收到综合利用之效，是全面开发，综合治理的典型。大造林、造大林的治山运动，采取大兵团整地，专业队造林的办法，与治水治土相结合，出色地完成了造林任务。同时比较普遍地出现了因地制宜、集中连片、营造大片林的现象，全省造万亩以上大片林的有三百三十三处。零陵五星岭林场，全面实行了环山水平带的整地方法，形成整齐的梯土林带，有效地保持了水土。全省大部分地方实行了全垦整地，进行粮林间作，既能增加农业收入，又能加速林木生长。开垦荒地、改良土壤的治土运动，与治水治山相互结合，去冬今春全省新开了荒地五、六百万亩。平江县十三万人上山，苦战十日，开荒二十五万亩，其中有十几万亩都作成了梯土。全省一千多万亩低产田，经过采取开沟排浸、掺土掺沙、增加肥料等办法，改良了四百多万亩。常德、邵阳、湘潭的部分地方，还进行了小丘并大丘，平整土地，搞田园化、河网化的工作。去冬今春“三治”运动的伟大成绩，不仅为农业生产的发展增加了有利条件，并且对改变人们的精神面貌也起了极大的作用。有越来越多的人已经不甘受自然的束缚和摆布，而要作自然的主人。
    大规模的治水治山治土，改造自然，这仅仅是开始，更艰巨更伟大更光荣的任务还在后边。湖南省的总面积有二十多万平方公里，有三亿零七百多万亩土地。现在山、水、土的分布大体是“七山一水二分田”。全省三千七百万人，现在仅有耕地五千六百多万亩，平均每人只有一亩半左右，这与农业生产迅速增长的要求是不相适应的。我省有丰富的劳力资源，有力量经营更多的耕地；在山区、丘陵区、湖区又有大量的可垦荒地，据初步调查在三千万亩以上。迅速把这些可垦的荒地开垦出来，是加速粮食增产、解决经济作物与粮争地、饲料作物与粮争地的极为重要的一着。全省的山地面积有二亿多亩，林地仅一亿亩左右，其中还有不少是稀疏林地，要把全部荒山绿化起来，需要作很大的努力。在幕阜山、万洋山、南岭、雪峰山、武陵山这五大山脉的万山丛中，不仅蕴藏着极其丰富的森林资源，而且盛产油料、药材、香料、野生纤维、野生淀粉、化工原料、香菇木耳等等。现在全省木材蓄积量在二亿立方米以上，年可伐量应该是二千万立方米左右，可是我们现在实际的年采伐量只有五、六百万立方米。据城步县1959年的调查，山地产品的采伐采集量，只达到应伐应采的十分之一。我们必须尽一切努力迅速地使这些宝贵的物资为社会主义建设服务。湖南的水利资源是极丰富的。湘、资、沅、澧四大水系的干支流，发源于湘南、湘西、湘东的边远山地，汇注于湘北的洞庭湖。四水的支流，流量五个秒公方以上，流域面积一百平方公里以上的就有五百六十二条之多，全长三万多华里。此外，还有无数的溪流，结成了天然的水网。这些水绝大部分都是清水长流，四季不断。估计水能藏量有一千八百万瓩之多。解放后十年来，特别是近两年以来，大修水库，筑拦河坝，控制水流，综合利用水力，成绩是很大的。但是我们控制的流域面积，仅仅达到10％左右，全省绝大部分的水，还没有被管束和利用。湖南的自然气候，季雨量分配不匀，4、5、6三个月的降雨量一般占年雨量的50％以上。春夏之间，山区有山洪灾，湘中地区有?田倒灌灾，湖区有渍灾和洪灾，每年至少有二、三百万亩良田遭受水灾损失。7、8月间的降雨量，一般的不如蒸发量大，常年有一千多万亩田土遭受旱灾。我们要把湖南的水基本上控制起来，使之听从人们的调度，为人类造福，还要作艰巨的工作。
    社会主义经济建设的大好形势，迫切要求我省的“三治”运动向更高的方向发展。农业是国民经济的基础，加快农业的发展，是高速度按比例地发展我省国民经济的中心环节。而要迅速提高农业的生产水平，单靠提高单位面积产量，单靠现有耕地和现已开发的山地与已建的水利工程，还是很不够的，必须积极地开发新的资源，增加新的生产对象。因此，在第二个五年计划的后三年，我们治水治山治土改造自然的中心，必须是大力开垦荒地，扩大耕地面积；开发山区，增加社会财富；开发水利，为社会主义建设服务。
    治水、治山、治土，三者一定要互相结合，才能够达到“综合治理、全面开发、综合利用”的目的。作规划和采取各项措施，都必须始终贯串这个思想。
    三年内全省要新增耕地三千万亩，并且作到在1962年全部成为熟土熟田。这就必须力争在今冬明春把三千万亩荒地开垦出来，尽可能地作到开一亩整一亩，整一亩种一亩，种一亩管一亩。这些新开的土地经过明年一年的加工整理，培养土壤，到1962年春，全省耕地面积即可达到八千多万亩，农业生产大发展就更有保证了。县、公社、大队、生产队以至作业组都应组织力量，依靠群众，立即动手，普遍进行勘察，把所有能够开成耕地的荒山荒地荒洲，作出全面开垦的规划，分期分批地开垦出来。开荒必须和水土保持结合起来，要一座山一座山地进行测量，因山势就地形作出具体规划。县和公社都可搞规划试点，作出样子，开现场会，全面推广。能够一次作成梯土的，最好一次作成梯土；不能一次作成梯土的，就应该留出环山平行草带，或者开挖环山水平沟。这样既有利于目前保持水土，又便于进一步改坡土为梯土。去冬今春已经全部垦为坡土的地方，还必须抓紧时间，经过测量规划，组织力量，把水平沟挖出来，以防止水土流失。现有的旱土有很大一部分是竖耕坡土，这对水土保持是十分不利的，应迅速改变这种情况，把坡土变成梯土，竖耕改为横耕。随着治水运动的进一步发展，要大力进行旱土改水田的工作，力争到1962年全省水田面积达到五千多万亩，比现有水田增加一千万亩左右，同时把一千多万亩旱土改成水浇地。改造低产田是增产的一项极重要的措施。对产量不高的田必须作具体分析，根据不同的情况，采取不同的措施，对症下药。冷浸田，开沟排浸，温水灌田；过水田，修过水圳，不让过水带走泥沙和肥料；土质不好的田，挑客土掺沙掺泥，增施肥料，改良土壤。总之，要尽一切努力在三年之内把全部低产田彻底改造过来。在湖区和平原地区从今冬开始要有计划有步骤地进行小丘并大丘的工作，逐步地实现园田化和河网化。
    开发山区，发展山区的经济，主要困难是交通不便，劳力不足，很多宝贵的物资运不出来。因此，开发山区、建设山区，除了少数人很少、地很多的地方，需要从外地抽调一些劳力上山以外，更主要的问题是积极修河修路，改善交通运输条件，把山区丰富的土特产品尽量采集运输出来；这样，一方面既可以满足国家社会主义建设全面大跃进的需要，一方面也可以迅速地繁荣山区经济，提高山区人民生活水平，作到以山养山，更快更好地建设山区。此外，还要继续开展“大造林、造大林”的治山运动。根据湖南省的地貌情况，全省林地面积以一亿六千万亩左右为宜，大约占全省总面积50％以上。造林规划必须与治水、治土的规划紧密结合起来，凡是可以垦为耕地的荒山应列入垦荒计划。根据山的高度、坡度、土质等不同情况，作出每座山从山顶到山腰到山脚的利用规划。一般的是远山造用材林，近山造经济林；山顶造用材林，山腰造经济林；山脚和坡度小的地方开垦耕地。丘陵区、湖区和水土流失严重的地区，除了大力营造用材林和经济林，争取木材自给以外，同时还要因地制宜的营造防风林、防浪林、水源林、固沙林、薪炭林等等。造林规划要注意各种林适当地集中连片，如营造大片的板栗林、核桃林、乌桕林、楠竹林等，既便于当前经营，又为将来实行机械化生产和集中加工打下有利的基础。估计到1962年湖南全省用材林可达到一亿亩，楠竹一千万亩、油茶二千万亩、油桐一千万亩、其他经济林一千万亩。同时，我们力争在1962年以前把全部宜林荒山都植上树，并且加强对现有林地的培育管理，补植稀疏林地，大搞粮林间作，充分发挥地力。
    “治水”工作，在解决防洪和灌溉的同时，要以极大的注意力解决交通运输和水能利用问题。这就需要全面地进行流域规划，从远处着眼，以蓄为主，社办为主，上游下游兼治，支流干流配合，大中小工程成套，强调综合效益。治水要从源头治起，山区需要蓄水灌溉的地方，无疑要修水库，拦河筑坝，开渠引水灌田。即使不需要蓄水灌溉的地方，为了解决山地运输和中下游的水害，也应该在溪流上层层作坝，大搞土坝、石坝、柴坝、木坝、水泥坝，土洋结合，力求把水蓄在山里。这样不仅可以缩小下游洪水时期和枯水时期的水位差别，特别是有利于山区的运输和利用水能加工农副产品。那怕只有一个流量或者不到一个流量，只要把水拦蓄起来，定期放水，把山区大量的木材和土特产品流送出来，比起人背肩挑、陆地运输，都要省得多，快得多，好得多，数量也大得多，同时还可以利用大量的水能。好处如此之多，又何乐而不为呢？湖南全省所有的山区县、社都力争在1962年把当地50％以上的流域面积基本上控制起来，这样全省蓄水量即可达到四百亿立方以上，基本上消灭水旱灾害，凡是有条件的社队也都可以建起水力站或水电站。在洞庭湖滨地区，地势平坦，应积极实现河网化，既有利于灌溉排渍，又便于田间运输；同时必须积极地围垦荒洲，扩大耕地，利用大面积的内湖大搞水产养殖。总之，不论山区、丘陵区、湖区，都应因地制宜，作出规划，积极开发，综合利用水利资源。
    进行开荒整地、修河筑坝、建设公路、开山造林等等大规模的农业基本建设，必须把苦干、实干、巧干结合起来：集中广大群众的智慧，大搞发明创造，推广先进技术措施，大力开展以工具改革为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，以土为主、土洋结合，在主要的劳动过程中，尽快地实现半机械化和机械化，以提高工效，减轻劳动强度。在湘西古丈、永顺已经有很多地方创造了开山犁，使用牛犁开荒，一人一牛一天可开荒一亩多，比人挖提高工效两三倍，这是一个可以普遍采用的好办法。衡山县在田间操作、短途运输、畜牧饲养、农副产品加工和生活服务等方面，开展了工具改革的“五条龙”运动，大大提高了工作效率，不仅提前完成了修水利的任务，提早作好了春耕准备，而且减轻了劳动强度，改善了工夫质量，使社员有劳有逸，生产劲头更大了。在治水、治山、治土运动中，积极创造、试制、鉴定、推广各方面的新工具和新措施，是各级领导必须重视的一项极为重要的工作。
    开发山区、开垦荒地，必须采取就地开发与远征开发同时并举的办法。根据荒地面积大小的不同情况，分别确定由生产大队就地开垦，或者由公社举办农林牧场开垦。大面积的荒山荒地，人民公社无力开垦的由国家举办垦殖场开垦。生产大队开垦的比较集中的荒地，可以建立新的生产队或作业组，采取居民点、养猪场、农副产品加工厂齐上山的办法，就地垦殖。对零星小片的可垦荒地，可由生产队就地开垦。
    要改造大地的外表，必须改造人们的内心。开展“三治”运动，改变山河面貌，是革自然的命，但首先要有正确的认识，才会积极地想办法，才会有更大的干劲。如果不把那些不正确的思想改过来，不能够树雄心，立大志，破除迷信，那就会是“困难重重，这也不可能，那也办不到”。治水、治山、治土，改造自然这样一件建设社会主义的伟业，如果没有广大群众自觉的、积极的行动，是作不到的。因此，必须全党动员，深入发动群众，进一步激起广大干部和群众建设社会主义的劳动热情，鼓足冲天干劲，在今春插秧之后和今冬明春，在全省范围内来一个轰轰烈烈的、群众性的开荒运动，力争今冬明春完成三千万亩的开荒任务，并以此带动治水、治山、治土运动向更高的方向发展，把我省建设得更富饶、更美丽。
