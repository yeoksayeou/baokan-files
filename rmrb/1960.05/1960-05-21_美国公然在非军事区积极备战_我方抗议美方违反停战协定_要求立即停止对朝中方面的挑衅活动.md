Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 19th: A message from Panmunjom: At the 119th meeting of the Military Armistice Commission today, Major General Zhu Changjun, the chief commissioner of the Korean and Chinese side of the Korean Military Armistice Commission, strongly condemned the U.S. side for violating the Armistice Agreement, actively preparing for war in the Demilitarized Zone, and openly conducting military provocations and reconnaissance activities against the Korean and Chinese side. He demanded that the U.S. side immediately cease these actions.

At the meeting, Major General Zhu Changjun pointed out that in order to escalate the tension in Korea and prepare for a new war, the U.S. side not only blatantly violated the Armistice Agreement by shipping new weapons such as "Matador" missiles and "Honest John" rockets into South Korea and launching them there, but also disregarded Article 1, Paragraph 1 of the Armistice Agreement by laying mines at major locations in the Demilitarized Zone, turning the Demilitarized Zone into a U.S. military position.

Major General Zhu Changjun continued, the U.S. side's military provocations against the Korean and Chinese side in the Demilitarized Zone are even more numerous. In the past year alone, there have been thirteen incidents of provocative shooting by U.S. personnel towards the Korean and Chinese side, protested by the Korean and Chinese side. There were ninety-four instances of U.S. personnel crossing the Military Demarcation Line and intruding into the Korean and Chinese side, of which the Korean and Chinese side pointed out. The U.S. side had to admit to seventy-nine of them in the face of solid evidence.

Major General Zhu Changjun pointed out that the U.S. side also sends a large number of special agents through the Demilitarized Zone to intrude into the Korean and Chinese side; it even established a special agent organ under the U.S. delegation to the Military Armistice Commission, directly training and dispatching special agents to intrude into the Korean and Chinese side. In addition, the U.S. side also attempted to abuse the meetings of the Joint Observer Teams to blatantly carry out military reconnaissance activities against the Korean and Chinese side.

Major General Zhu Changjun pointed out that all of the above actions by the U.S. side in the Demilitarized Zone, which violate the Armistice Agreement, are aimed at further escalating the tense situation in Korea and preparing to launch a war of aggression in Korea again.

At today's meeting, the U.S. side's chief commissioner, Dawson, tried his best to distort the facts, counter-accusing the Korean and Chinese side of "violating the Armistice Agreement" in an attempt to extricate himself from a passive situation. Major General Zhu Changjun refuted the U.S. side's attitude forcefully. Major General Zhu Changjun pointed out that for seven years, the records of the Military Armistice Commission meetings, secretary meetings and Joint Observer Team meetings, record that the U.S. side violated the armistice agreement in the demilitarized zone 163 times. These records irrefutably prove how frequently the U.S. side carried out armed attacks on the Korean and Chinese side in the Demilitarized Zone, how viciously it took barbaric actions, and how frantically it sent special agents to the Korean and Chinese side. Major General Zhu Changjun declared that the Korean and Chinese side will continue to hold the U.S. side accountable until the U.S. side accepts and implements the demands of the Korean and Chinese side.

    美国公然在非军事区积极备战
    我方抗议美方违反停战协定
    要求立即停止对朝中方面的挑衅活动
    据新华社平壤19日电　板门店消息：朝鲜军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员朱昌骏少将在今天举行的军事停战委员会第一百一十九次会议上，强烈谴责美方违反停战协定，在非军事区积极备战、公开对朝中方面进行军事挑衅和侦察活动，并且要求美方立即停止这些行动。
    朱昌骏少将在会上指出，美方为了加剧朝鲜的紧张局势、准备新战争，不仅悍然违反停战协定，向南朝鲜运入并在南朝鲜发射了“斗牛士”式导弹和“诚实的约翰”火箭等新式武器；而且无视停战协定第一条第一款的规定，在非军事区各主要地点敷设地雷，把非军事区变成了美方的军事阵地。
    朱昌骏少将接着说，美方在非军事区对朝中方面进行军事挑衅的行为，更是层出不穷。仅在去年一年当中，朝中方面提出抗议的美方人员向朝中方面地区进行挑衅性射击的事件就有十三起。美方人员越过军事分界线侵入朝中方面地区的，仅由朝中方面指出的就达九十四名。美方在确凿的证据面前也不得不承认了其中的七十九名。
    朱昌骏少将指出，美方还通过非军事区，派遣大量特务，侵入朝中方面地区；甚至还在军事停战委员会美方代表团下面也设立了特务机关，直接训练和派遣特务侵入朝中方面地区。此外美方还企图滥用联合观察小组的会议，明目张胆地对朝中方面进行军事侦察活动。
    朱昌骏少将指出，美方在非军事区进行的上述一切违反停战协定的行为，乃是为了进一步加剧朝鲜紧张局势、准备重新在朝鲜发动侵略战争。
    在今天的会议上，美方首席委员陶逊极力颠倒黑白，反诬朝中方面“违反停战协定”，企图摆脱被动处境。朱昌骏少将对美方的这种态度进行有力的驳斥。朱昌骏少将指出，七年来，军事停战委员会会议、秘书长会议和联合观察小组会议的记录中，记载着美方在非军事区违反停战协定的事件有一百六十三次。这些记录无可辩驳地证明美方多么频繁地在非军事区对朝中方面进行武装袭击，多么恶毒地采取野蛮行动，多么猖狂地对朝中方面派遣特务。朱昌骏少将宣称，朝中方面将继续追究美方的责任，直到美方接受并实现朝中方面的要求为止。
