Hearing the news of climbing Mount Everest from the north slope, I am overjoyed and compose this poem. Dedicated to all comrades of the mountaineering team. In Tibetan, "珠穆 (Zhūmù)" means goddess, and "朗玛 (Lǎngmǎ)" means third. Of the five goddess peaks, from north to south, the main peak in the center is the highest, ranking third, hence the name "珠穆朗玛 (Zhūmùlǎngmǎ)" it is said.

　　The goddess's ethereal third peak,
　　Planted with the red flag, exceptionally red.
　　Climbing from the north slope, the army takes the lead,
　　The east wind melts away the snow without a trace.
　　Heroic courage conquers heavenly dangers,
　　Collective spirit achieves unparalleled feats.
　　Generously sing aloud, spreading to the four seas,
　　Brothers joining hands to caress the vast sky.
　　May 27, 1960

    喜闻攀上珠穆朗玛峰
    郭沫若
    闻由北麓攀上珠穆朗玛峰，喜而赋此。奉赠爬山队全体同志。藏语“珠穆”为女神，“朗玛”为第三。女神五峰，自北而南，其正中主峰最高，居第三位，故称“珠穆朗玛”云。女神缥缈第三峰，插上红旗分外红。北麓攀登军冠首，东风吹化雪无踪。英雄肝胆夷天险，集体精神旷代功。慷慨高歌传四海，弟兄携手抚苍穹。一九六○年五月二十七日
