    Rationally Use Pastures, Improve Grazing Techniques, Launch a High-Yield Campaign
    Ningxia's Sheep Production Increases by 20% Compared to Last Year
    (Our Dispatch) Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region is experiencing a thriving scene of bumper sheep production. Currently, over 90% of pregnant ewes have given birth, with a lamb survival rate generally around 90%. The total number of sheep in the region has increased by 20% compared to the end of last year.
    In this year's bumper harvest of sheep, the number of ewes giving birth to twins and triplets is higher than in the past, and even miracles of one birth producing five lambs have occurred. In the Meili Management Area of the Xiansheng People's Commune in Zhongwei County, twenty-three sandy wool mountain sheep have bred three litters over two generations from last year to the present, all with twins, and some with triplets or quadruplets, producing a total of one hundred and fifty-four lambs, an increase of more than seven times. Tongxin County has increased from 290,000 sheep at the end of last year to more than 390,000, a net increase of nearly 35%. In some communes and teams in Ningshuo, Zhongwei, Haiyuan, Guyuan, Lingwu and other counties, the lamb survival rate is as high as 98% or more. Currently, all sheep, large and small, are stronger than in previous years.
    The continuous bumper harvests of sheep in Ningxia since the communization fully demonstrate the unparalleled superiority of the People's Commune. The communes have unified and rationally arranged agricultural and pastoral labor, overcoming the past phenomenon of focusing on agriculture during the busy farming season and on animal husbandry during the slack farming season. Many communes have strengthened their leadership over animal husbandry production, with one secretary in the commune specifically responsible, and generally the general branch secretary of large teams taking the lead in establishing animal husbandry teams. After the communization, grazing was generally carried out according to the breed, physique, and size of the sheep, further strengthening scientific feeding management. Last winter and this spring, the communes also rectified the grazing teams and sheep farms, transferring a group of politically reliable Party members, League members, and commune members with grazing experience to be herders, and strengthened their ideological education, improving the level of feeding management.
    Because of the large scope of commune management, good conditions have been created for the unified planning and rational layout of farmland and grasslands. The communes have fixed the suitable grazing grasslands and rationally arranged the grazing locations of the sheep herds according to the width of the grasslands and the size of the sheep herds, not only fully utilizing and protecting the grasslands, but also overcoming the phenomena of搶grazing,乱grazing, and unplanned reclamation. Seven grassland work stations have been established throughout the region, which directly promote zoned rotational grazing and grassland construction. This year, the communes have planted an average of one mu of feed and forage base for every five sheep; and one mu for every two experimental sheep. Last winter, the members organized to store more than 300 million jin of winter grass and repaired more than 4,700 pens and sheds, meeting the requirements of sufficient grass and warm pens, ensuring the safe overwintering of sheep of all sizes. During the busy season of lambing, the communes added a lot of personnel and equipment. The lambing team organized by Yanchi County was twice as large as last year, with more than 5,000 herders and lambers guarding the ewes day and night to assist in lambing. In addition, regular epidemic prevention work was carried out throughout the region, and a total of more than 4.13 million sheep (times) were treated for epidemic diseases last year, greatly reducing sheep epidemic diseases this year.
    Since last year, many communes have established high-yield sheep flocks and launched a campaign for multiple births and high yields of sheep, which has powerfully promoted the rapid development of sheep. The high-yield fact of the Meili Management Area's sheep flock producing twins and multiple lambs year after year proves that high-speed development of animal husbandry is possible, and has opened a good start for high-speed development of animal husbandry production in the future, established a benchmark, and also promoted the "learn, compare, catch up, and help" bumper harvest competition. Last year, the eighteen multi-birth and high-yield experimental sheep flocks cultivated by Yanchi County had an average net increase of 83.9% for sheep and 108.2% for goats, and the average survival rate of reproduction reached more than 150%.
    The development of this movement has further broken the conservative notions that "sheep cannot develop at high speed" and that "sheep can only have one litter and one lamb a year."

### 合理使用牧场　改进放牧技术　开展高产运动  宁夏羊只比去年增产二成

    合理使用牧场　改进放牧技术　开展高产运动
    宁夏羊只比去年增产二成
    本报讯　宁夏回族自治区羊只生产出现一片欣欣向荣的丰产景象。目前，有90％以上的怀胎母羊产了羔，羔羊成活率一般在90％左右。全区羊只总数比去年年底增长20％。
    在今年的羊只大丰收中，下双羔、三羔的比以往都多，甚至出现了一胎产五羔的奇迹。中卫县先声公社美丽管理区二十三只沙毛山羊，由去年到现在繁殖了三槎两代，都是双槎双羔，有的还是三羔、四羔，共产羔羊一百五十四只，增长七倍多。同心县由去年末的二十九万只羊，增加到三十九万多只，净增率将近35％。宁朔、中卫、海原、固原、灵武等县有些社队羔羊成活率高达98％以上。目前，全区大小羊只都比往年健壮。
    公社化以来宁夏羊只的连年丰收，充分显示出人民公社的无比优越性。公社统一合理地安排农牧业劳动，克服了过去农忙抓农业，农闲抓牧业的现象。很多公社都加强了对畜牧业生产的领导，公社有一名书记专门负责，一般大队都以总支书记挂帅，成立了畜牧队。公社化以后普遍按羊只的品种、体质、大小等实行了分群放牧，进一步加强了科学的饲养管理。去冬今春各公社对放牧队伍和羊场也进行了整顿，抽调了一批政治可靠、具有放牧经验的党团员和社员当放牧员，并加强对放牧员的思想教育，提高了饲养管理水平。　　由于公社经营范围大，给农田和草场的统一规划、合理布局创造了良好条件。各公社把宜牧草原都固定下来，根据草场宽窄、羊群大小，合理安插羊群放牧地点，不仅充分利用和保护了草原，而且克服了抢牧、乱牧和无计划开荒的现象。全区已建立七个草原工作站，这些都直接地推动了划区轮牧和草原建设。各公社今年为羊只种植饲草饲料的基地平均每五只羊有一亩；试验群每两只有一亩。去年冬季组织社员打贮冬草三亿多斤，修补圈棚四千七百多个，达到草足圈暖的要求，保证了大小羊只安全过冬。接羔大忙季节，各公社增添了不少人员和设备。盐池县组织的接羔队伍比去年大一倍，有五千多名放牧员和接羔员昼夜轮流守护母羊，进行接羔。此外，在全区范围内还开展了经常性的防疫工作，去年共防治羊只疫病四百一十三万多只（次），使今年羊只疫病大大减少。
    从去年以来，许多公社建立的羊只高额丰产群，开展了羊只多胎高产运动，有力地促进了羊只的迅速发展。美丽管理区羊群连年双槎多羔的高额丰产事实证明高速度发展畜牧业是可能的，并为今后高速度发展畜牧业生产打开了良好的开端，树立了标兵，也促进了“学、比、赶、帮”的丰产竞赛运动。去年盐池县培养的十八个多胎多产试验羊群，平均绵羊净增83.9％，山羊净增108.2％，繁殖成活率平均达150％以上。
    这一运动的开展，也进一步打破了“羊只不能高速度发展”和“羊只一年只能下一槎一羔”的保守观念。
