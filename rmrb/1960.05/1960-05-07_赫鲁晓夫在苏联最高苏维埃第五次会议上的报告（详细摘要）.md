Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 5th (TASS): Khrushchev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, delivered a report on May 5th at the Fifth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union regarding the abolition of taxes on workers and staff and other measures to improve the welfare of the Soviet people. The following is a summary:

    The 21st Congress of the Party pointed out that with the completion of the Seven-Year Plan, the level of accumulation in socialist enterprises will continuously increase and will eventually become the sole source for ensuring the expansion of socialist reproduction and further improving the people's living standards. In this situation, it is not necessary to levy taxes on residents. The complete exemption from taxes on the wages of workers and staff, as well as other measures aimed at improving the welfare of the Soviet people, will be a state action of great political and economic significance. This action will once again clearly demonstrate the indisputable superiority of the socialist system. The prerequisite for realizing this measure is the tremendous surge in the productive forces of our motherland, which is advancing towards communism.

    The past year, 1959, was a year of outstanding achievements in developing productive forces and establishing the material and technical base of communism. It can be said with full justification that even in our country, which has always developed at a high speed, we have never done as much in a single year as we did in 1959—the first year of the Seven-Year Plan.

    The industrial tasks of the first year of the Seven-Year Plan have been greatly overfulfilled. The growth rate of industrial production in one year was more than 11%, while the plan stipulated 7.7%. In the first year of the Seven-Year Plan, the value of industrial products produced above the plan was nearly 50 billion rubles, exceeding the annual output of pre-revolutionary Russian industrial products. In one year, more than a thousand new large-scale industrial enterprises were put into production.

    Despite the unfavorable natural conditions in many parts of the country last year, collective farms and state farms harvested 7.6822 billion poods of grain, 770 million poods more than the average annual output from 1954 to 1958. Cotton production was 4.7 million tons, higher than ever before.

    In 1959, the national income increased by 8% compared with 1958, an increase of approximately 100 billion rubles. This year, according to the plan, the national income will increase by 9%, reaching approximately 1,450 billion rubles.

    The achievements made by the national economy last year make it possible for us to formulate higher industrial production tasks for the second year of the Seven-Year Plan. The preliminary results of the work in the first four months of this year show that the plan for the second year of the Seven-Year Plan is being implemented smoothly. The task of industrial production in the first quarter was completed by 104%.

    The achievements of the Soviet people in developing socialist industry and agriculture, and in developing Soviet science and technology, show that in the peaceful competition with the United States, victory will absolutely belong to our side, to the socialist side. In the forty-two years since the establishment of the Soviet regime, the average annual growth rate of industrial products has been 10.1%, while the United States has been 3.3%. In the past six years, this ratio has changed even more favorably for the Soviet Union. The average annual growth rate of the Soviet Union is 11.3%, while the United States is 2.4%. In these six years, the industrial output of the Soviet Union per capita has increased by 71%, while the United States has hardly increased at all. Recently, the number of unemployed in the United States has increased again (the army of unemployed in the United States exceeds 4.2 million).

    The high speed of planned development of social production is a solid foundation for continuously improving the material welfare of the people. From 1953 to 1959, the real wages of Soviet workers and staff increased by 45%, and the real income of farmers increased by 64%.

    Shortening the working day is one of the most important measures to improve the living conditions of the Soviet people. As of April 1, 1960, about 16 million people had already been transferred to shortened working days—seven-hour and six-hour working days. As everyone knows, in 1960, all workers and staff will transition to seven-hour and six-hour working days.

    According to the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the Soviet government, our planning agencies are formulating a long-term plan for the economic and cultural development of our country in the next twenty years, which will open up prospects for our country to advance at an unprecedented speed along the road to communism.

    Among the measures to further continue to improve the material welfare of the Soviet people, the abolition of residents' taxes occupies an important position. This is a major measure of great economic and political significance.

    Under the current conditions, due to the achievements in economic development, the stability of finance and currency circulation, the Soviet Union possesses all the necessary resources to start abolishing taxes on the wages of workers and staff this year.

    After comprehensively measuring all our possibilities, the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union proposed to gradually abolish wage taxes and submitted the bill on this issue to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union for discussion.

    The draft stipulates that wage taxes will be abolished in stages, starting this year and ending in 1965. It is stipulated that taxes on employees with relatively low wages will be abolished first, and then taxes will be gradually stopped for all employees.

    The bill stipulates that part or all of the income tax on employees with a monthly wage rate and wage amount of less than 2,000 rubles will be abolished, and the abolished amount will be counted on the state's account. As a result, the wages received by 99.4% of employees will increase, and the increase will be equal to all or part of the taxes previously paid.

    The income tax on employees with a monthly wage of more than 2,000 rubles will be abolished by deducting an amount equal to the income tax from their wage standard and wage amount. Therefore, all the wages received by these employees will be preserved.

    After the abolition of income tax, the increase in the net wages received by 59.4 million people will be equal to all the taxes they originally paid, the increase in the wages of several million people will average about half of the original tax, and only a small number of staff will not have an increase in net wages received.

    At the same time as the abolition of income tax, the tax on single people, people without families, and people with few family members will be completely abolished due to state subsidies.

    At the same time as the abolition of taxes on the wages of workers and staff, measures are being implemented to increase the minimum wage in accordance with the resolution of the 21st Congress of the CPSU.

    We should implement a policy of approaching wage levels, and achieve narrowing the gap in staff remuneration by raising the low wage standards of employees to the middle standard, and raising the middle standard to the higher standard. This is our method, because it is the correct and fair method.

    With the abolition of residents' taxes, the accumulation of the socialist economy will become the sole source of our income. The smooth allocation of funds for economic construction and cultural construction will completely depend on the completion of production and accumulation plans by enterprises and economic organizations. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to carry out a truly nationwide movement to strive for further increasing product production, improving labor productivity, reducing costs, continuously improving production profitability, and making fuller use of the existing potential of the national economy.

    The growth rate of total production and labor productivity largely depends on the successful promotion of new technologies and new production process regulations, on striving to expand the overall mechanization and automation of production processes, and on fully utilizing various production capacities.

    It is necessary to continuously improve the level of organizational work and educational work, and guide the working people to strive to ensure that each enterprise can complete the national plan and tasks, and to strive to practice thrift in the national economy. Continuously improving labor productivity on the basis of technological progress is the correct path to improving our economy and the welfare of the Soviet people.

    The Soviet Union has a solid currency and a stable monetary system, which effectively guarantees the planned organization of domestic currency circulation, and promotes the effective use of material and human resources on this basis.

    The Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union discussed and adopted a resolution to increase the standard of our monetary unit tenfold from 1961, so new currencies will be issued.

    This measure will not cause any losses to residents or the country.

    The conversion ratio of old currency to new currency is: one new ruble is equal to ten old rubles. Prices and residents' incomes will be converted according to this ratio.

    For the convenience of residents, a sufficient exchange period—three months—will be stipulated.

    The above measures are implemented in the context of a great economic upsurge and very solid currency turnover, and they are the achievements made in the construction of a communist society. The change in price standards will further consolidate the Soviet ruble. These measures will also be of great significance for further practicing thrift and carrying out a nationwide movement against all waste.

    The change in the ruble exchange rate, which will be implemented simultaneously with the above measures, will not bring losses to either foreign countries or the Soviet Union.

    Due to the abolition of taxes on working people and the increase in the income of working people, the purchasing power of residents will greatly increase. This requires greatly increasing the commodity resources in the market.

    The smooth development of our economy has created conditions for accelerating the development of consumer goods production.

    We will solve the task of fully meeting the residents' requirements for food within seven years, and ensure that residents have sufficient clothes and shoes. By the end of the Seven-Year Plan, the Soviet Union will surpass the most developed capitalist countries in Western Europe in terms of per capita consumption of many of the most important consumer goods. We have also put forward such a task: within five years after the completion of the Seven-Year Plan, to catch up with, and then surpass, the United States in terms of per capita consumption of consumer goods, including textiles and shoes.

    Some comrades may raise such a question: are we too hasty to abolish taxes and increase investment in the production of consumer goods? Will this weaken the development of the means of production industry, that is, the development of our economy's main potential, which will be used in the future to develop the economy and mainly to establish our national defense means?

    When we were drafting the recommendations to be submitted to the Supreme Soviet for review, we considered all of this and made a comprehensive estimate. We are convinced that now we have every possibility to make a decision on abolishing taxes on residents and increasing investment in the production of consumer goods without weakening the development of heavy industry. At the same time, we will not, and should not, reduce our concern for the development of heavy industry for a minute. Heavy industry should always be the focus of attention of every working person in the Soviet Union and every working person in all socialist countries, so as not to deviate from Lenin's path and not to succumb to the pressure of capitalism.

    In order to realize Lenin's great wish, the Communist Party and the Soviet government will continue to relentlessly care about the development of the country's heavy industry in the future, and pay great attention to the development of departments that produce consumer goods and food.

    As you all know, on May 16, the leaders of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France will meet in Paris.

    Those participating in this meeting will study the most important international issues. The solution of these issues is desirable and, moreover, necessary in order to lay the foundation for a solid peace and ensure the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems. Smoothly studying these issues at the upcoming top-level meeting will improve relations between countries, convince people that the forces of peace are greater than the forces of war, and thus clear the way for the development of policies aimed at strengthening peace and friendship between the peoples of all countries.

    What are these issues? As you all know, the first issue that makes everyone uneasy is the disarmament issue. Complete and thorough disarmament is the most fundamental way to ensure world peace and eliminate war from human social life. If no country has an army or weapons, then all countries will have to use peaceful methods and resolve even the most acute issues through negotiations.

    The Soviet government has put forward proposals on disarmament. What we are proposing is to solve this problem most fundamentally—complete disarmament of all countries, destruction of the means of conducting war, and disbanding of all armies. We will strive to convince our negotiating opponents that this is the best solution.

    The second issue—this is the need to sign a peace treaty with Germany and, on this basis, resolve the West Berlin issue. The West Berlin issue has become a focus of contradictions that can cause all kinds of sudden events and contain all kinds of dangerous consequences. In order to completely eliminate the remnants of World War II in Europe and normalize the situation in Berlin (West Berlin still has an occupation system that is long outdated), we propose to sign a peace treaty with the two actually existing Germanys.

    Other issues of mutual relations between socialist countries and capitalist countries, or, as some people say, issues of East-West relations, will also be discussed at the top-level meeting. These issues have been discussed in my meetings with the heads of a series of countries, and many of them have also been the subject of discussion at various international conferences and the United Nations. Now I would like to emphasize the following point: if the fundamental issues of today—disarmament, resolving the issue of reconciliation with Germany, including the West Berlin issue—are resolved, then the task of improving East-West relations will naturally also be resolved.

    However, it seems that resolving the issue of disarmament, consolidating European peace, and easing the international situation does not satisfy everyone. There is still a considerable force in the West that cannot understand how necessary it is now for socialist countries and capitalist countries to practice peaceful coexistence, and cannot understand how absurd any attempt to continue to pursue a "brink of war" policy under the current conditions.

    Just look at the outcry in some Western newspapers about my recent speech in Baku. This speech reflects the Soviet government's unwavering desire to hope that the top-level meeting can achieve practical results, including the issue of the peace treaty with Germany and the issue of West Berlin, but some Westerners have described this desire as some kind of "threat" to Western countries.

    As long as you look at what West Germany is doing now and the policies implemented by the government of the Federal Republic of Germany, the necessity of concluding a peace treaty with Germany becomes particularly obvious. West Germany is stepping up preparations for war, expanding the Bundeswehr. The West German warlords are bent on possessing atomic weapons. Bundeswehr soldiers are already receiving atomic warfare training. All of this is obvious to everyone. The West German government firmly refuses to recognize the national boundaries determined in Europe after the defeat of Hitler's Germany, and firmly refuses to establish normal diplomatic relations with Eastern European countries that were once invaded by Hitler. The leaders of the Bonn government bluntly stated that their intention is to annex the German Democratic Republic and eliminate the socialist system there. The working people of the German Democratic Republic and all honest people have answered this: gentlemen, this is not possible!

    While the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and other socialist countries are making every effort to prevent the revival of German militarism, Western countries are promoting the arming of West Germany.

    This is a very risky policy, and we should tell our former allies directly: whether you are willing or not, but you are helping to arm the Federal Republic of Germany, which is equivalent to pushing the revanchists to launch a third world war with your own hands.

    The people of all countries demand that the leaders of all countries draw correct conclusions from the serious mistakes of the past and not allow German militarists to once again impose war on mankind.

    It seems that the whole problem is that West Germany is now an ally of our former allies in the war against Hitler's Germany. The reason why our former allies oppose the signing of a peace treaty is essentially because Chancellor Adenauer opposes this treaty, and Adenauer's policy has absolutely no peaceful purpose. For example, everyone knows that on the issue of concluding a peace treaty and establishing a free city in West Berlin, Adenauer insists on a position that is beneficial to the revanchists.

    In order to maintain the occupation system in West Berlin, Westerners often use the excuse that the residents of West Berlin are satisfied with the current situation. But this reason is completely unfounded. First of all, the issue of eliminating the West Berlin occupation system is not only related to the residents of this city, it also has broader significance. West Berlin is located within the territory of the German Democratic Republic. Therefore, the current situation in West Berlin is also no less related to the residents of the German Democratic Republic.

    If the occupation system in West Berlin is retained and the troops of the occupying countries continue to be stationed there, then this will not only poison the lives of the residents of the German Democratic Republic in many ways, but also cannot but make all Germans feel uneasy.

    When foreign troops are stationed in the capital of a country, and they are the troops of countries that harbor unfriendly intentions towards this country, who would not think that this is a completely abnormal phenomenon. And this situation exists in the German Democratic Republic. Therefore, all Germans, especially the residents of the German Democratic Republic, are so concerned about resolving the West Berlin issue.

    The situation in West Berlin also makes the people of other European countries uneasy. The people of these countries justly regard West Berlin as a hotbed of dangerous tension. They are concerned that the abnormal state of this city will be eliminated as soon as possible, because this state hinders the establishment of friendly relations between countries.

    If they are really concerned about the interests of the Germans, then, under the current circumstances, that is, when there is a system different from the German Democratic Republic in West Berlin, which is located in the center of the German Democratic Republic, turning West Berlin into a free city will be the only correct way to resolve the West Berlin issue. The proposal on establishing a free city takes into account the interests of the residents of West Berlin, the residents of the German Democratic Republic, and the residents of West Germany to the same extent, because this can eliminate the spark of war, which, if not extinguished, will drag the German people into a new and terrible war. Those who oppose the normalization of the situation in West Berlin and attempt to undermine the possibility of reaching an agreement on this issue in advance are harming the interests of the Germans and harming the interests of strengthening European peace.

    In my speech in Baku, I already mentioned the statement made by U.S. Undersecretary of State Dillon. In this statement, Dillon said that Khrushchev was "walking on very thin ice." He said this because he believed that the Soviet government's policy would fail. Sir, do not be uneasy about our policy. We are not walking on thin ice. We are standing on solid granite that no one can shake. The foundation of the Soviet government's unshakable foreign policy is the communist construction in our country, which the Soviet people are carrying out with unprecedented enthusiasm in history.

    Since we are talking about thin ice layers, Mr. Dillon, please look at your own feet. What are you standing on? Your policy is, in many ways, built on supporting colonialism, enslaving and plundering backward nations, and economically independent countries.

    Our policy, which is consistently and actively striving to strengthen peace and cooperation between the people of all countries, will continue to gather strength in the future and pave the way for mankind to a better future. And the policy aimed at exploiting the people of all countries is doomed to bankruptcy. The people everywhere will understand and see the true essence of this policy sooner or later, and see and understand why they live in poverty and are oppressed. Their own life experience will draw the only correct conclusion, that the fault lies in the policy of monopoly capital, the "brink of war" policy, the arms race, and the colonial exploitation policy. The people of all countries will rise up against this policy, and this will mean its true bankruptcy.

    How should we estimate the overall situation that is currently forming on the eve of the top-level meeting? I am fully authorized by the Soviet government to say to the representatives of the Supreme Soviet that the steps taken by our opponents recently in connection with the upcoming talks, the speeches they made to explain their positions, and some of their actions (which I will talk about in particular later) give regretfully little reason to hope that the governments of those countries whose heads we are going to meet are really seeking concrete solutions.

    Now there is an impression that some leaders in the United States have not yet come to the conclusion that it is necessary to ease international tensions and resolve disputes through negotiations. Recently, influential forces in the United States—imperialist groups and militarists supported by the Pentagon—have become obviously rampant. These aggressive forces insist on continuing the "cold war" and the arms race, and even carry out direct provocations.

    The recent remarks of Herter, Nixon, Dillon, and other political figures who determine the foreign policy of the current U.S. government have attracted widespread public attention. These remarks are an ominous sign, and they are far from giving people hope for a good outcome of the talks that will begin on May 16. Regrettably, these speeches were supported by the U.S. President himself. The U.S. President even said at a press conference that these talks clarified the direction of the U.S. government's foreign policy. This situation makes the situation even gloomier.

    It should be mentioned that President Eisenhower sent me a letter saying that he might stay in Paris until May 23, and then set off to return to the United States, and make a short stop in Lisbon. He also said that if it is appropriate to continue our talks after May 22, then he will designate U.S. Vice President Nixon as his agent.

    I replied to the President that the issue of the duration of the summit meeting should be subordinated to the fundamental task—making this meeting a success, and the issue of the duration of the meeting is best to be considered in light of the progress of the meeting. I also pointed out that the issue of the appropriateness of continuing the meeting without the President's participation should be decided at the meeting by all participants through consultation. At the same time, I said that when I meet with Mr. Eisenhower, Mr. Macmillan, and General de Gaulle in Paris, we will exchange views on these issues.

    The U.S. President's intentions are regrettable. We Soviets believe that there is nothing more important now than consolidating peace and preventing war, and nothing more concerned about by all countries and people in the world. Therefore, if the leader of a country intends to limit his attendance at the meeting regardless of how the talks are progressing, then this shows that the issues to be discussed at the top-level meeting do not seem to have received the attention they deserve from the U.S. government.

    As for Vice President Nixon's participation in the talks, I would like to say a few words. When Mr. Nixon came to our country to preside over the opening of the American Exhibition, I met with him in Moscow more than once, and I also talked with him in the United States. I can hardly get rid of the impression that no matter what Mr. Nixon thinks, what he considers the least is to reach an agreement on disputed issues, eliminate tensions, eliminate the "cold war," and stop the arms race. Please forgive Mr. Nixon for my frankness. I have talked to him about this in person, and I hope he will not blame me for saying this now in our parliament. I am worried that if Mr. Nixon is entrusted to conduct negotiations, then a situation may arise, as the famous folk proverb says: "Let the goat guard the cabbage."

    The progress of our talks with them on the cessation of nuclear tests and the disarmament issue also cannot prove that Western countries intend to reach an agreement on important international issues.

    All of this shows that some figures in those countries that we will meet at the top-level meeting have obviously not realized that the "position of strength" policy adopted by socialist countries has gone bankrupt and failed. It seems that some people want to revive this policy, just like trying to revive a dead mouse by injecting some magic potion. This "injection" is now being carried out, trying to revive this dead corpse with all kinds of words and deeds full of the atmosphere of the "cold war." Not only that, recently we have also encountered some things that are directly provocative.

    Representative comrades! I am entrusted by the Soviet government to tell you about the U.S. acts of aggression against the Soviet Union in recent weeks.

    What do these acts of aggression manifest themselves in? They manifest themselves in: the United States has sent its own aircraft to cross our borders and enter Soviet territory. We have already protested to the United States about some similar acts of aggression in the past, and we have also notified the UN Security Council. However, the United States, regardless of the conclusive evidence, routinely superficially evaded and tried in every possible way to deny the fact of aggression. When we fought back against this aggressive action and the United States suffered losses due to the aircraft being shot down, it cunningly protested and even demanded that we compensate them for their losses.

    On April 9, 1960, the United States carried out another act of aggression. A U.S. aircraft entered our airspace from the direction of Afghanistan. Obviously, no sane person would imagine or suspect that Afghanistan, which is friendly to our country, would commit such an act of aggression. We believe that this aircraft belongs to the United States, and it can be seen that its base is in Turkey, Iran, or Pakistan, which are colluding with the United States due to their obligations to the Central Treaty Organization aggressive bloc.

    Intrusion into another country's borders—this is a bad plot against the summit meeting. Because the purpose of holding a meeting of heads of government should be to ease international tensions, eliminate the "cold war" state, stop the arms race, completely and thoroughly disarm, resolve the issue of reconciliation with Germany and the West Berlin issue, and all issues that hinder the normal peaceful coexistence of countries with different social and political systems.

    We exchanged views in the government, and at that time it was decided that we would not take any special measures, nor issue notes and memorandums, because we knew from past experience that this would not actually achieve any results. The aggressive bloc thinks that it is stronger than others, so they act according to this principle: the weak accuse the strong, the strong do not have to pay attention to this, but continue their rude actions.

    At that time, we strictly instructed our soldiers, especially those directly responsible for the country's air defense, to take resolute actions and never allow foreign aircraft to arbitrarily intrude into our airspace.

    It seems that the U.S. warlords very much appreciated the impunity of the April 9 incident, so they decided to repeat this aggressive action. For this reason, they chose the most solemn festival of our people and the working people of all countries, the festival of the solidarity of the international working class—"May Day." On this morning, at 5:36 AM Moscow time, a U.S. aircraft crossed our border and continued to penetrate deep into Soviet airspace. The Minister of Defense immediately reported this aggressive action to the government. The government replied: The aggressors understand what they are doing when they intrude into another country's territory. If he is not punished, then he will carry out new provocations. Therefore, action should be taken to shoot down the aircraft! This task has been completed, and the aircraft has been shot down.

    Preliminary investigations show that this aircraft is American, although it has no markings.

    Now, a committee of experts is studying all the materials we have obtained. It has been found that this aircraft, like the aircraft of April 9, may have taken off from Turkey, or Iran, or Pakistan, and crossed the Soviet border.

    After studying all the materials we now have, the Soviet government will lodge a serious protest with the United States and warn it that if similar acts of aggression are taken against our country in the future, then we have the right to take the measures that we deem necessary to fight back and ensure our security. I think we also need to issue the most serious warning to those countries that provide their territory to the United States as a base for carrying out aggressive actions against our country.

    We believe that the incident that occurred on May 1 deserves the attention of all countries in the world, because it is a serious warning. Think about it, what would happen if a Soviet aircraft appeared over New York, Chicago, or Detroit and flew over these cities. What would the United States react?

    U.S. officials have said more than once that they have bombers carrying atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs on duty. When a foreign aircraft approaches, they take off and fly to the bombing target designated for each bomber. This means the beginning of war. Please ask these U.S. officials, if you want to take such measures unilaterally when you imagine that someone is invading your country, then why don't you think about the fact that when a foreign aircraft threatening our security appears over our country, we will use the same method to fight back?! You need to know that you have the right to take action in this situation, but why don't we have the right to take action?

    We think that no one will doubt that we have a way to fight back. True, we don't have bombers on duty, but we have rockets on duty. These rockets can accurately hit the set target and are more accurate and reliable than the actions of the aircraft on duty.

    Representative comrades! I think that the countries that provide their territory to the aggressive forces, thus facilitating these forces to attack us, should also be severely warned from this lofty rostrum. The governments of these countries should have understood long ago that they are playing with fire, because these countries will also be retaliated against, and they will be punished due to the shortsighted actions of their governments in providing their territory to the aggressive forces of a third country.

    The incident of the U.S. aircraft intruding into our airspace is very disturbing. Therefore, we will submit this issue to the Security Council and ask the United States to stop this aggressive action, because this action contains great dangers.

    It is difficult to imagine how to estimate the actions of the U.S. aggressive bloc. Because on May 16, we will be meeting with U.S. President Eisenhower at the meeting of heads of government, and two weeks before this, the U.S. Air Force actually took aggressive action against the Soviet Union. What is this, is it celebrating "May Day"? Didn't the people who sent the aircraft understand what they were doing? Probably, they hoped to get away with it, thinking that the aircraft they sent with robber-like purposes could fly back. But this action is completely incompatible with the goals faced by the heads of government who will be meeting in Paris.

    It is inevitable to draw such a conclusion: the U.S. imperialist aggressive forces are recently taking the most rampant actions to sabotage the meeting of heads of government, or at least obstruct the reaching of an agreement that the world is hoping for.

    But, the people of all countries are beginning to understand where true freedom is, and where tyranny is. Let's look at the events in South Korea. The head of the puppet regime, Syngman Rhee, who is a good friend of the United States and is called the father of South Korea by some people in the United States, has now been overthrown by the people themselves and has become a political zombie. The events were not provoked by the Communists. Even the U.S. leaders have to admit this. The South Korean people have had enough of patience and suffering, and they have risen up to resist the appalling oppression. The uprising was still spontaneous and unorganized. The people realized and saw more and more clearly that the problem is not only with Syngman Rhee, but also with those who support him, those who support Syngman Rhee to ride on the necks of the South Korean people. These people are the main culprits of the South Korean people's suffering.

    It seems that it is no coincidence that the "free world" has so many people who demand freedom and are demonstrating!

    Representative comrades! People have an impression that the aggressive action taken by the United States against the Soviet Union once again was predetermined to be carried out on the eve of the meeting of heads of government. This was done to put pressure on us, trying to intimidate us with their non-existent military advantage and weaken our will to strive to ease tensions, strive to eliminate the "cold war" state, and stop the arms race. This action was to make it impossible to reach an agreement on disputed issues. You need to know that it cannot be said that this aircraft is a messenger of peace, a messenger with good intentions. No! This is a complete robber flight with aggressive purposes.

    We can tell the gentlemen who sent this aircraft: your attempt to put pressure on us to force us to bend the knee cannot work on us. The Soviet Union has the ability to fight back against anyone who attempts to use pressure to obtain a solution that is beneficial to the aggressors.

    Comrades! The Soviet people and our government have always expressed peace and friendship to the United States in the past and now. But we have been rewarded with despicable ingratitude. The provocative actions of the U.S. military have angered us, which is understandable. But we should not use this emotion to dominate our actions. We should use reason, not emotion, to dominate our actions.

    If the national leaders of all countries are seriously concerned about maintaining peace, they should soberly estimate the consequences that this action may produce, and consider what this will cause. The aircraft of the crazy Hitler intruded into our country's airspace again and again on the eve of World War II. The Soviet government protested, but Hitler ignored these protests, and then launched an attack on us. What was the result? Everyone knows very well.

    How do we estimate the repeated intrusions of U.S. aircraft?

    The Soviet government believes that this is military reconnaissance to create tension and push us to a "cold war" stance. This is done to preserve the remnants of the "cold war" ice, so that they can freeze again and restore the state of tension, so that the imperialists can plunder their own people with taxes, continue the arms race, place their own people in the terror of before the war, and make them obey their command.

    The Soviet Union once again calls on the U.S. government to end the "cold war" state and stop provoking other countries. In relations between countries, they should follow the desire for peace, so as to ensure the peace, tranquility and happiness of all people in the world.

    We want to say to the American people that despite the aggressive actions taken against our country, we have not forgotten the friendly meetings during our visit to the United States. I am still deeply convinced that the American people, except for certain imperialist monopoly groups, hope for peace and hope to be friendly with the Soviet Union. And we also have the same attitude towards the Americans. However, the aggressive actions that I talked about should also alert the American people.

    All those who cherish peace and spare no effort to fight for guaranteeing peace and eliminating the "cold war" should make greater efforts to stop aggressive actions and strictly demand that those who are keen on military adventures behave themselves and prevent them from dragging the people of all countries into a world-class rocket-atomic war. In this war, the aggressors will also perish, but the main blood shed due to the war will still be the people of all countries.

    We hope for peace. But our commitment to peace does not mean begging for peace. Peace must be won. Peace can be won in labor: strengthening our country's strength, manufacturing the most advanced and most accurate weapons, developing the economy, developing technology and science, creating more and more new machines that lighten people's labor, and guaranteeing to meet people's material and spiritual needs. If Western countries do not want to disarm, then our soldiers, our officers, and our Soviet army should have the world's best necessary number of weapons in order to give the aggressors a devastating blow, if they invade the Soviet state or other socialist countries.

    The more imperialism shows its irreconcilable contradictions of harming the people and creating war, the faster it will expose itself, reveal its carbuncle, and the faster it will arouse the anger and hatred of the people in imperialist countries. Imperialism sharpens the international situation, creates various crises, and creates phenomena that endanger the cause of peace. This will arouse the anger of the people and dig its own grave.

    Representative comrades! Our government is pursuing a very clear and consistent policy of peaceful coexistence. This is the Leninist policy. We adhere to this policy and will make every effort to find the possibility of resolving international disputes through negotiations. However, if someone still wants to weaken socialist countries by pursuing a stubborn "position of strength" policy without understanding that this card has already been lost, then we have to say to them: such an era has passed.

    We were not born in the bells. Our socialist countries were born in the cannon fire of the "Aurora," and we grew stronger in the battles with armed interventionists and domestic counter-revolutionary forces fully supported by imperialist countries. The Soviet people smashed the counter-revolution and built a powerful socialist country.

    We are going to participate in the Paris Conference with a pure heart and good intentions, and we will not spare our strength to reach mutually acceptable agreements. But we should soberly estimate various possibilities and should see some omens that predict that these talks may not satisfy the wishes of the world's people who crave a peaceful life.

    We have been, and will continue to be, doing our best to strive

    赫鲁晓夫在苏联最高苏维埃第五次会议上的报告（详细摘要）
    新华社6日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科5日讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫5日在苏联最高苏维埃第五次会议上作了关于取消工人和职员赋税和提高苏联人民福利的其他措施的报告。摘要如下：
    党的第二十一次代表大会指出，随着七年计划的完成，社会主义企业的积累的程度将不断地提高，并且最终将成为保证扩大社会主义再生产和保证进一步提高人民生活水平的唯一来源。在这种情况下，就没有必要向居民征税了。完全免除从职工工资中抽税以及旨在提高苏联人民福利的其他措施将是一个具有重大政治意义和经济意义的国家行动。这一行动将再一次明显地表明社会主义社会制度的无可争辩的优越性。实现这一措施的前提就是我们正在走向共产主义的祖国的生产力的巨大高涨。
    已经过去的1959年是在发展生产力、建立共产主义物质技术基础方面取得卓越成就的一年。可以有充分根据地说，即使在一向高速度发展的我国，我们在一年中所做的事也从来没有像1959年——七年计划第一年所做的那样多。
    七年计划第一年的工业任务已经大大超额完成。一年中工业生产的增长率为11％以上，而计划规定为7.7％。在七年计划的第一年，工业超计划生产的工业品价值将近五百亿卢布，超过了革命前俄国工业品的全年产量。在一年中间，有一千多项新的大型工业企业投入生产。
    尽管去年国内许多地区的自然条件不好，但是集体农庄和国营农场收获了七十六亿八千二百万普特的粮食，比1954到1958年每年平均年产量多七亿七千万普特。棉花产量为四百七十万吨，比以往任何时候的产量都高。
    1959年的国民收入比1958年增加了8％，即大约增加了一千亿卢布。今年，根据计划，国民收入将增加9％，即达到大约一万四千五百亿卢布。
    去年国民经济所取得的成就使我们有可能在七年计划的第二年制订更高的工业品生产的任务。今年头四个月工作的初步结果表明，七年计划第二年的计划执行得很顺利。第一季度工业品生产的任务完成了104％。
    苏联人民在发展社会主义工业和农业、在发展苏联的科学和技术方面所取得的成就表明，在同美国的和平竞赛中，胜利将绝对属于我们方面，属于社会主义方面。苏维埃政权建立四十二年以来，工业产品每年平均增长速度为10.1％，而美国则为3.3％。最近六年来，这种比例发生了更有利于苏联的变化。苏联每年平均增长速度为11.3％，而美国为2.4％。在这六年中，苏联按人口平均计算的工业产量增长了71％，而美国却几乎没有增长。最近美国失业人数又有增加（美国失业大军超过四百二十万人）。
    社会生产有计划发展的高速度是不断提高人民物质福利水平的牢固基础。从1953年到1959年这一期间内，苏联职工实际工资增加了45％，农民的实际收入增加了64％。
    缩短工作日是改善苏联人民的生活条件的最重要的措施之一。根据1960年4月1日的情况，约有一千六百万人已获转入缩短了的工作日——七小时和六小时的工作日。大家知道，1960年，全体工人和职员都将过渡到七小时和六小时的工作日。
    根据党中央和苏联政府的指示，我们的计划机关正在制订我国最近二十年经济和文化发展的远景计划，这个计划将为我国空前迅速地沿着通往共产主义的道路前进开辟远景。
    在进一步继续提高苏联人民的物质福利的措施中，取消居民的赋税占有重要的地位。这是一项具有巨大的经济和政治意义的重大措施。
    在目前的条件下，由于在发展经济方面所取得的成就，财政和货币流通的稳固，苏联拥有一切必要的资源，使得在今年就可以着手取消对职工工资的征税。
    苏联部长会议在全面衡量我们的一切可能性以后，提出逐步取消职工工资税的建议，并把关于这一问题的法案提交苏联最高苏维埃讨论。
    草案规定分阶段取消工资税，从今年开始到1965年结束。规定首先取消工资比较低的职工的税，然后逐步停止向所有职工征税。
    法案规定取消每月工资率和工资额在二千卢布以下的职工的所得税的一部或全部，这笔取消的款项算在国家的账上。结果99.4％的职工到手的工资将有所增加，而增加的数额等于过去交纳的税款的全部或者一部。
    每月工资在二千卢布以上的职工的所得税将要取消，其办法是从他们的工资标准和工资额中减掉款额等于所得税的那一部分。因此，这些职工到手的工资全部保存下来。
    取消所得税之后，有五千九百四十万人到手的净工资的增加部分将等于原先他们纳税的全部，有几百万人的工资的增加部分平均大约将等于原纳税的一半，只有为数不多的工作人员到手的净工资将没有增加。
    在取消所得税的同时，由于国家贴补而将完全取消对单身者、无家属者和少家属公民的税收。
    在取消对职工工资的税收的同时，根据苏共第二十一次代表大会的决议，正在实现提高最低工资额的措施。
    我们应当执行使工资水平接近的政策，通过使职工的低薪标准提高到中等标准，使中等标准提高到高等标准的办法来达到缩小工作人员劳动报酬的距离。这就是我们的办法，因为这是正确的公正的办法。
    随着居民赋税的取消，社会主义经济的积累将成为我国收入的唯一来源。对经济建设和文化建设的顺利拨款，将完全取决于各企业和各经济组织完成生产和积累计划的情况。所以，具有头等重要意义的事情是：开展真正全民性的运动，争取进一步增加产品生产、提高劳动生产率、降低成本、不断提高生产赢利和更充分地利用国民经济现有的潜力。
    生产总额和劳动生产率的增长速度，在很大程度上取决于顺利推广新技术和新的生产工艺规程，取决于尽力扩大生产过程的全盘机械化和自动化，取决于充分利用各种生产能力。
    必须不断地提高组织工作和教育工作的水平，引导劳动人民为使每个企业都能完成国家计划和任务而努力，为在国民经济中厉行节约而努力。在技术进步的基础上不断提高劳动生产率是提高我国经济和苏联人民福利的正确道路。
    苏联拥有巩固的货币和稳定的货币制度，这种货币制度有效地保证着有计划地组织国内的货币流通，并且在这个基础上促进有效使用物力和人力。
    苏联部长会议讨论并且通过了决议，从1961年开始把我国货币单位标准提高到十倍，因此要发行新货币。
    这一措施无论对居民、对国家都不会引起任何损失。
    旧货币换为新货币的折算比率是：新币一卢布等于旧币十卢布。物价和居民的收入都将按照这一比率折算。
    为了使居民方便起见，将规定充裕的兑换期限——三个月。
    上述措施是在经济大高涨、货币周转非常稳固的情况下实行的，它是在共产主义社会的建设中取得的成果。价格标准的改变将会更加巩固苏联的卢布。这些措施对于进一步厉行节约和开展反对一切挥霍浪费现象的全民运动也将具有重大的意义。
    将与上述措施同时实行的卢布外汇牌价的改变，无论对外国还是对苏联都不会带来损失。
    由于取消劳动人民赋税和劳动人民收入的提高，居民的购买力将大大提高。这就要求大大增加市场的商品资源。
    我国经济的顺利发展为更快加速发展消费品生产创造了条件。
    我们要在七年内解决完全满足居民在食品方面的要求的任务，并且保证居民有充足的衣服和鞋子。到七年计划结束时，苏联将有许多最重要的消费品在按人口平均计算的消费量方面超过西欧最发达的资本主义国家。我们还提出了这样的任务：在完成七年计划后的五年内，在按人口平均计算消费品，其中包括纺织品和鞋的消费量方面赶上，然后超美国。
    有些同志可能会提出这样的问题：我们是否过于急忙地取消税收和增加对消费资料生产的投资？这是否将削弱生产资料工业，即今后用来发展经济，而主要是用来建立我国国防手段的我国经济主要潜力的发展呢？
    当我们在拟订提交给最高苏维埃审查的建议时，我们考虑了所有这一切并作了全面的估计，我们深信，现在我们有一切可能，在不削弱重工业发展的情况下，作出关于取消向居民收税和增加消费资料生产投资的决议。同时，我们一分钟都不会，也不应当减少对重工业发展的关心。重工业永远应当是苏联每个劳动人民和一切社会主义国家每个劳动人民注意的中心，这样才不致脱离列宁的道路和不向资本主义的压力屈服。
    共产党和苏联政府为了实现列宁的宏愿，今后仍打算不懈地关怀国家重工业的发展，并大力注意生产消费品和食品的部门的发展。
    你们都已经知道，5月16日苏联、美国、英国和法国四国领导人将在巴黎举行会晤。
    参加这次会谈的人将研究最重要的国际问题，为了奠定巩固的和平基础和保证不同社会制度的国家和平共处，这些问题的解决是合乎愿望的，更是必须的。在即将召开的最高级会议上顺利地研究这些问题将改善国家之间的关系，使人民相信和平力量大于战争力量，从而为发展旨在加强和平和各国人民之间的友谊的政策扫清道路。
    这是哪一些问题呢？你们都清楚，第一个使所有的人不安的问题是裁军问题。全面彻底裁军，这是保障世界和平和在人类社会生活中排除战争的最根本的办法。如果没有一个国家有军队有武器，那么所有国家就不得不用和平的方法、通过谈判来解决甚至最尖锐的问题了。
    苏联政府提出了关于裁军的建议。我们建议的正是要最根本地来解决这个问题——一切国家彻底裁军、销毁进行战争的手段、解散一切军队。我们将努力使我们的会谈对手相信，这是最好的解决办法。
    第二个问题——这就是必须签订对德和约和在此基础上解决西柏林问题，西柏林问题已变成会引起种种突然事件和包含着种种危险后果的矛盾的焦点。为了在欧洲彻底消除第二次世界大战的残迹和使柏林局势正常化（西柏林至今还存在早就过时的占领制度），我们建议签订对德和约，即同两个实际上存在的德国签订和约。
    在最高级会议上还要讨论社会主义国家和资本主义国家之间的相互关系的其他问题，或者像有些人所说的东西方关系问题。这些问题在我同一系列国家首脑的会谈中已讨论过了，而其中许多问题也曾成为各种国际会议和联合国的讨论对象。现在我想强调指出以下一点：如果现今的根本问题——裁军、解决包括西柏林问题在内的对德媾和问题——得到解决的话，那么改善东西方关系的任务自然也就解决了。
    但是，看来解决裁军问题、巩固欧洲和平问题和缓和国际局势问题并不是使人人都满意的。西方还有一股势力相当猖狂，它们无论如何不能理解社会主义国家同资本主义国家实行和平共处现在有多么必要，也不能理解在当前条件下继续执行“战争边缘”政策的任何企图都是多么荒谬。
    请看看，某些西方报纸就我不久前在巴库的演说掀起怎样的叫嚣。这次演说反映出苏联政府确定不移的愿望，希望最高级会议能够取得实际成果，其中包括对德和约问题和西柏林问题，可是某些西方人士却把这种愿望说成是对西方国家的什么“威胁”。
    只要看一下西德现在的所作所为和德意志联邦共和国政府所执行的政策，那么缔结对德和约的必要性就特别明显了。西德正在加紧备战，扩充联邦国防军，西德军阀一心要想拥有原子武器，联邦国防军的士兵已经在受原子战争训练。这一切都是有目共睹的。西德政府坚决不承认希特勒德国失败以后在欧洲所确定的国界、坚决拒绝同曾遭希特勒侵略的东欧国家建立正常的外交关系。波恩政府的领导人直言不讳地说，他们的意图在于并吞德意志民主共和国和消灭那里的社会主义制度。德意志民主共和国的劳动人民和所有正直的人们对此的回答是：先生们，这办不到！
    在苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克以及其他社会主义国家尽一切努力阻止德国军国主义复活的同时，西方国家却在促使西德武装。
    这是一种非常冒险的政策，我们应该直截了当地对我们过去的盟友说：不管你们愿意不愿意，但是，你们帮助武装德意志联邦共和国，这等于用自己的手推动复仇主义者去发动第三次世界大战。
    各国人民要求各国领导人从过去的严重错误中得出正确的结论，不允许德国军国主义者再次把战争强加在人类的头上。
    看来，全部问题在于：西德现在是我们以前对希特勒德国作战的盟国的盟国。我们以前的盟国之所以反对签订和约，实质上是因为阿登纳总理反对这个条约，而阿登纳的政策绝对没有和平的目的。譬如说，谁都知道，在缔结和约和建立西柏林自由城市的问题上，阿登纳坚持有利于复仇主义者的立场。
    西方国家人士为了维护在西柏林的占领制度，常常借口说什么西柏林居民对目前状况感到满意。但是这种理由是完全没有根据的。首先，消除西柏林占领制度的问题不仅关系着这个城市的居民，它还具有更广泛的意义。西柏林位于德意志民主共和国境内。因此，西柏林目前的状况对德意志民主共和国的居民的关系也并不稍小一些。
    如果保留西柏林的占领制度并让占领国的军队继续驻扎在那里，那么这在许多方面不仅会毒化德意志民主共和国居民的生活，而且也不能不使所有的德国人感到不安。
    当在一个国家的首都驻扎着外国军队，而且驻扎的还是那些对这个国家抱着不友好的目的的国家的军队时，谁会不认为这是一种完全不正常的现象呢。而在德意志民主共和国就存在着这种状况。因此所有的德国人、特别是德意志民主共和国的居民才如此关心解决西柏林问题。
    西柏林局势也使欧洲其他国家的人民感到不安，这些国家的人民公正地把西柏林看作是危险的紧张局势的策源地。他们关心的是，尽快消除这个城市的不正常状态，因为这种状态妨碍各国之间建立友好关系。
    如果是真的关心德国人的利益，那么，在目前情况下，即当有不同于德意志民主共和国的制度在位于德意志民主共和国中心的西柏林存在时，把西柏林变成自由城市将是解决西柏林问题的唯一正确的办法。关于建立自由城市的建议在同样程度上考虑到西柏林居民、德意志民主共和国居民以及西德居民的利益，因为这可以消除战争火苗，这种火苗如果不把它扑灭，就会把德国人民拖进新的可怕的战争。反对西柏林局势正常化和企图事先破坏就这一问题达成协议的可能性的人，就是在损害德国人的利益和损害加强欧洲和平的利益。
    我在巴库讲话时已经谈到美国副国务卿狄龙发表的声明。在这个声明中，狄龙说赫鲁晓夫“在非常薄的冰块上走动着”。他这样说就是认为，苏联政府的政策会遭到失败。先生，不要为我们的政策感到不安，我们不是在薄冰块上行走，我们是在任何人都摇撼不动的牢固的花岗岩石上面站着。苏联政府的这种不可动摇的外交政策的基础就是在我国的共产主义建设，苏联人民正用历史上从未见过的热情在进行这种建设。
    既然谈到了薄冰层，那么狄龙先生请你看看自己的脚下，你是站在什么上面的？你们的政策在许多方面是建筑在支持殖民主义、奴役和掠夺落后民族和经济上没有独立的国家之上的。
    我国政策在始终不渝地和积极地争取加强和平和各国人民之间的合作，以后它仍然要鼓足力量，为人类铺设通向美好未来的道路。而旨在剥削各国人民的政策，是注定要破产的。各地的人们不是今天就是明天会明白和看出这种政策的真正实质，会看到和了解到他们为什么生活在贫困之中，受到压迫。他们自己的生活经验会得出唯一正确的结论，即这里的罪过在于垄断资本的政策、“战争边缘”政策、军备竞赛和殖民主义剥削政策。各国人民将起来反对这种政策，这将意味着它的真正破产。
    对于目前在最高级会议前夕正在形成的总局势究竟可以怎样来估计呢？我受苏联政府的全权委托向最高苏维埃代表们说，我们的对手们近来就即将举行的会谈所采取的步骤、他们阐述自己立场的演说，以及他们的某些行动（这些行动我在后面要特别谈到），都令人遗憾地还使人很少有理由可以希望，我们要同其首脑会见的那些国家的政府在真正寻求具体的解决办法。
    现在使人产生一种印象，这就是：美国某些领导人士现在还没有得出必须缓和国际紧张局势和通过谈判方式来解决争执问题的结论。近来美国国内有影响的势力——帝国主义集团、以五角大楼为支柱的军国主义分子明显地猖狂起来了。这些侵略势力坚持继续进行“冷战”和军备竞赛，甚至进行直接挑衅。
    赫脱、尼克松、狄龙和决定美国现任政府外交政策的其他政治活动家们最近的言论引起了广大公众的注意。这些言论是一个凶兆，它们远远不能使人对将在5月16日开始举行的会谈的良好的结局产生希望。遗憾的是，这些演说却得到美国总统本人的支持。美国总统在一次记者招待会上竟说，这些谈话阐明了美国政府外交政策的方针。这种情况就使局势更加阴暗。
    应当提一提，艾森豪威尔总统寄了一封信给我，信中说，他可能在巴黎停留到5月23日，然后启程回美国，并在里斯本稍作停留。他还说，如果在5月22日之后继续举行我们的会谈是合宜的话，那么他将指定美国副总统尼克松作为自己的代理人。
    我回答总统说，关于大国首脑会议的期限问题应当服从于根本任务——使这次会议获得成功，会议期限问题最好要考虑会议的进程来解决。我还指出，关于在总统不参加下继续举行会议的合宜性问题，应该在会上由所有与会者协商决定。同时我说，当我同艾森豪威尔先生、麦克米伦先生和戴高乐将军在巴黎会见时，我们将要就这些问题交换意见。
    美国总统的意图令人遗憾。我们苏联人认为，现在没有比巩固和平和防止战争更加重要，更为世界上所有国家和人民关心的事情了。因此，如果一个国家领导人不管会谈进行得怎样而打算限制自己出席会议的时间，那末这表明最高级会议要讨论的问题看来没有得到美国政府应有的重视。
    至于说到尼克松副总统参加会谈，我想说一点。当尼克松先生到我国来主持美国展览会开幕的时候，我在莫斯科同他会见过不只一次，在美国也同他谈过话。我很难摆脱这样一个印象：不论尼克松先生想的什么，他考虑得最少的是就争执的问题达成协议、消除紧张局势、消除“冷战”和停止军备竞赛。请尼克松先生原谅我的坦率，在直接见面时我曾经对他谈到这点，我希望他不会责备我现在在我国的议会中这样讲。我担心，如果尼克松先生受托进行谈判，那么就可能出现一种情况，如著名的民间谚语所说的那样：“让山羊去看守白菜”。
    我们同他们就停止核试验，以及裁军问题进行的会谈的进程也不能证明西方国家打算就重要国际问题达成协议。
    所有这一切说明，我们将在最高级会议上会见的那些国家的某些人物显然还没有意识到，对社会主义国家采取的“实力地位”政策已经破产了、失败了。看来某些人想使这个政策复活，就像想靠注射什么魔术药剂使一只死老鼠复活一样。现在正在进行这种“注射”，企图用各种各样充满“冷战”气息的言行使这具死尸复活。不但如此，最近我们还碰到一些直接进行挑拨的事情。
    代表同志们！我受苏联政府的委托必须告诉你们最近几周来美国对苏联的侵略行为。
    这些侵略行为表现在哪里呢？它们表现在：美国派出了自己的飞机越过我们的国境、侵入了苏联的领土。对某些类似的侵略行为，我们过去就已经向美国提出过抗议，也通知了联合国安全理事会。但是，美国不顾确凿的证据照例在表面上敷衍抵赖，千方百计企图否认侵略事实。当我们对这种侵略行动进行了回击，美国因飞机被击毁而受到损失的时候，它却狡狯地提出了抗议，甚至提出了要我们赔偿他们的损失的要求。
    1960年4月9日美国又进行了一次侵略行动。美国飞机从阿富汗方向侵入了我国领空。很明显，任何一个思想健全的人都不会设想和猜疑，对我国友好的阿富汗会作出这种侵犯的行为来。我们相信这架飞机是属于美国的，并且可以看出，它的基地是在因承担中央条约组织侵略集团的义务而同美国勾结在一起的土耳其、伊朗或巴基斯坦境内的某个地方。
    侵入别国边境——这是对最高级会晤的不良的谋图。因为举行政府首脑会议的目的应当是缓和国际紧张局势、消除“冷战”状态、停止军备竞赛、全面彻底裁军、解决对德和约和西柏林问题，以及妨碍不同社会和政治制度的国家正常地和平共处的一切问题。
    我们曾经在政府中交换了意见，当时决定我们不采取任何特别的措施，不发照会和备忘录，因为我们根据过去的经验知道，这实际上不会得到任何结果。侵略集团认为自己比别人强，所以他们按照这样的原则行事：弱者控告强者，强者对此不必加以理睬，而继续自己的无礼行动。
    当时我们就严格地指示我们的军人、特别是那些直接负责国家空防的部队，要他们采取坚决行动，绝不容许外国飞机恣意侵入我国领空。
    看来，美国军阀很欣赏4月9日那种消遥法外的做法，因此，他们决定重演这种侵略行动。为此，他们选择了我国人民和各国劳动人民最隆重的节日，国际工人阶级团结的节日——“五一”节。这一天早上莫斯科时间五时三十六分，一架美国飞机越过我国国境，并继续深入到苏联领空。国防部部长立即把这一侵略行动报告给政府。政府回答说：侵略者明白，他们侵入别国领土是来干什么的。如果他没有受到惩罚的话，那么，他还会进行新的挑衅。因此应该采取行动，击落飞机！这个任务已经完成，飞机被击落了。
    初步调查表明，这架飞机是美国的，虽然它没有标志。
    现在，专家委员会正在研究我们已经获得的全部材料。已经查明，这架飞机同4月9日的飞机一样，可能是从土耳其、或者伊朗、或者巴基斯坦起飞而越过苏联国境的。
    在研究过我们现在掌握的所有材料以后，苏联政府将向美国提出严重抗议，并警告它，如果对我国今后还采取类似的侵略行动，那么，我们就有权利采取我们认为有必要采取的措施来回击它们，以保障我国的安全。我想，我们还要对那些把本国领土提供给美国作为对我国进行侵略行动的国家提出最严重的警告。
    我们认为，5月1日发生的事件值得世界各国重视，因为这是一个严重的警报。你们想想，如果苏联飞机出现在纽约、芝加哥或者底特律的上空并飞过这些城市的话，那么将发生怎样的情况。美国会有什么反应呢？
    美国的官方人士曾经不止一次地说，他们有携带原子弹和氢弹的轰炸机在值勤，当外国飞机靠近的时候，它们就起飞，飞向指定给每个轰炸机的轰炸目标。这就意味着战争的开始。请问这些美国官方人士，如果你们想在设想有人侵略贵国的时候单方面采取这种措施的话，那么，为什么你们不想一想，当我国上空出现了威胁着我国安全的外国飞机的时候，我们会用同样的办法来回击呢？！要知道，你们有权利在这种情况下采取行动，我们又何尝没有权利采取行动呢。
    我们想，任何人也不会怀疑，我们是有办法回击的。不错，我们没有轰炸机值勤，但是我们有值勤的火箭，这种火箭能准确无误地击中既定目标，并且比值勤飞机的行动更加准确可靠。
    代表同志们！我认为，也应该在这个崇高的讲坛上最严厉地警告把本国领土提供给侵略势力，从而便于这种势力进攻我们的那些国家。这些国家的政府早就应该明白这是在玩火，因为这些国家也会受到回击，它们将由于本国政府把本国领土提供给第三国侵略势力这种没有远见的行动而受到惩罚。
    美国飞机侵犯我国领空的事件是非常令人不安的。因此，我们将把这个问题提交给安全理事会，要美国停止这种侵略行动，因为这种行动孕育着巨大的危险性。
    很难想像应该怎样估价美国侵略集团的这种行动。因为5月16日，我们将在政府首脑会议上同美国总统艾森豪威尔会晤，而在这以前两个星期，美国空军竟对苏联采取了侵略行动。这是什么，是庆祝“五一”节吗？难道派遣飞机的人不懂得他们在干什么吗？大概，他们希望能消遥法外，认为他们抱着强盗目的派来的飞机能够飞回去的。但是，这种行动同即将在巴黎会晤的政府首脑所面临的目标是毫不相容的。
    必然得出这样一个结论：美国的帝国主义侵略势力近来正采取最猖狂的行动来破坏政府首脑会议，或者无论如何要阻挠达成全世界都希望达成的协议。
    但是，各国人民开始明白，真正的自由在哪里，而暴政在哪里。让我们看看南朝鲜的事件吧。傀儡政权的头子、美国的好朋友和美国有人称之为南朝鲜国父的李承晚现在已经被人民自己推翻了，成了政治僵尸。事件不是由共产党人挑起的。就连美国领导人也不得不承认这一点。南朝鲜人民的忍耐和苦难已经够了，他们奋起反抗骇人听闻的压迫。起义还是自发的，无组织的。人民了解到并且越来越明确地看到，问题不仅仅在于李承晚，而且还在于支持他的人，扶植李承晚骑在南朝鲜人民脖子上的人。他们这些人就是南朝鲜人民苦难的主要罪魁。
    看来，“自由世界”有这样多要求自由的人民示威游行，并不是偶然的！
    代表同志们！人们有这样一种印象，美国又一次对苏联采取的侵略行动是预先定好在政府首脑会议前夕进行的。这样做是为了对我们施加压力，企图用他们根本不存在的军事优势来恐吓并削弱我们争取缓和紧张局势、争取消除“冷战”状态和停止军备竞赛的斗志。这种行动是为了使得不能就争执问题达成协议。要知道，总不能说这架飞机是和平使者，是具有善良愿望的使者。不！这是十足的带有侵略目的的强盗飞行。
    我们可以告诉派遣这架飞机的先生们：你们想施加压力迫使我们弯腰屈膝的企图，对我们是不可能起作用的。对一切企图用压力取得有利于侵略者的解决办法的人，苏联是有能力进行回击的。
    同志们！苏联人民和我国政府过去和现在一向对美国表示和平和友好。但是我们却得到了卑鄙的忘恩负义的报答。美国军人的挑衅行动使我们感到愤慨，这是可以理解的。但是我们不应当用这种感情来支配自己的行动。应当用理智，而不是感情来支配行动。
    如果各国的国家领导人认真地关心维护和平的话，他们就应当清醒地估计到这种行动可能产生的后果，考虑到这会引起什么事情。疯狂的希特勒的飞机在第二次世界大战前夕一次再次地侵入我们祖国的领空。苏联政府曾提出抗议，但是，希特勒不理睬这些抗议，接着就向我们发动进攻。结果怎样呢？大家都非常清楚。
    我们如何估计美国飞机一次再次地侵犯呢？
    苏联政府认为，这是制造紧张、把我们推向“冷战”立场上去的军事侦察。这样做是为了保存“冷战”冰块的残余部分，使它们再结冻起来，重新恢复紧张状态，以便使帝国主义者可以用赋税掠夺本国人民，继续军备竞赛，把本国人民置于战前的恐怖之中，使他们听任驱使。
    苏联再一次呼吁美国政府结束“冷战”状态，停止对其他国家的挑衅。在国与国之间的关系中，应该遵循和平的愿望，以保证世界上所有人们的安宁、和平和幸福。
    我们要对美国人民说，尽管对我国采取了侵略活动，但是我们并没有忘记在访问美国时的那种友好会见。我现在仍然深信，除了某些帝国主义垄断集团之外美国人民是希望和平、希望同苏联友好的。而我们对美国人也是抱同样的态度的。但是，我所谈到的侵略活动，也应该引起美国人民的警觉。
    凡是珍视和平和不遗余力地为保障和平、消除“冷战”而斗争的人，都应当作出更大的努力，制止侵略行动，严厉要求热衷于军事冒险的人规规矩矩，防止他们把各国人民拖入世界性的火箭—原子战争中去。在这个战争中侵略者也必将灭亡，但是由于战争而流血的主要还是各国人民。
    我们希望和平。但是我们致力于和平并不意味着乞求和平。和平必须争取。和平可以在劳动中来争取：壮大我国的力量，制造出最新式的最准确的武器，发展经济，发展技术和科学，创造越来越多的减轻人们劳动的新式机器，保证满足人们的物质和精神的需要。如果西方国家不想裁军，那么我们的士兵、我们的军官、我们苏联军队就应当拥有世界上最优良的必要数量的武器，以便给侵略者以毁灭性打击，如果他们侵犯苏维埃国家或其他社会主义国家的话。
    帝国主义越多地表现出它的危害人民和制造战争的不可调和的矛盾，它就越快地暴露自己，揭示自己的痈疽，也就越快地激起帝国主义国家人民的愤怒和仇恨。帝国主义使国际局势尖锐化，制造各种危机和危害和平事业的现象，这就会引起人民的愤怒而自掘坟墓。
    代表同志们！我国政府奉行的是非常明确的、始终如一的和平共处政策。这是列宁主义的政策，我们坚持这一政策，并将尽一切努力找到通过谈判解决国际争端的可能性。但是，如果有人仍旧想用推行死硬的“实力地位”政策的办法来削弱社会主义国家，而不懂得这一张牌已经打输了的话，那么我们就要对他们说：这样的时代已经过去了。
    我们不是在钟声中诞生的。我们社会主义国家是在“阿芙乐尔号”的炮声中诞生的，我们是在同武装干涉者和受帝国主义国家全力支持的国内反革命势力进行的战斗中壮大起来的。苏联人民粉碎了反革命，建起了一个强大的社会主义国家。
    我们是怀着圣洁的心灵和善良的愿望去参加巴黎会议的，为了达成相互可以接受的协议，我们不吝惜力量。但是我们应当清醒地估计到各种可能性，应当看到一些预示这次会谈可能不满足渴求和平生活的世界各国人民的愿望的预兆。
    我们过去是、将来仍然是竭尽全力争取通过谈判解决已经成熟的问题。如果情况比较好，即出席政府首脑会议的各国代表能够达成协议，那么我们最为高兴。但是，自我安慰是不对的，因为这样会被幻想俘掳。古代民谣说得好：“把希望寄托给上帝，而自己可仍得当心”。
    因此，我们指望在最高级会议上将对期待解决的重要问题进行实质的谈判。但是，如果有人想同我们开玩笑，如果认为，开会只是为了显示实力和迫使苏联作出单方面的让步，那么就不会得到任何结果。谁抱着这样的打算，那就让他知道——他是办不到这一点的，就像他看不到自己的耳朵一样。我们依靠的是自己的力量，是我们社会主义制度无穷尽的可能性。
    我们今后将继续沿着和平的道路前进，发展经济，提高我国人民的生活水平，巩固苏联的国防。如果说，我们经住了第二次世界大战的考验，清除了战争的后果，那么现在，处于全盛时期的苏联和整个社会主义阵营能够和资本主义世界较量了。帝国主义国家是不能消耗尽我们人民的力量的。我们坚信，胜利将属于我们，理智将获得胜利，我们的和平意图将获得胜利。如果谈判将不能成功，那么，全世界人民也会明白是谁的过错。
    苏联政府不倦地谋求消除国际紧张局势。但是，消除紧张局势，这不是无的放矢的主张，它应该表现在具体行动中。苏联政府认为，代表同志们，我相信你们也这样认为，全体苏联人民也这样认为，在即将举行的最高级会议上，应该作出重大努力来加强普遍和平，会议参加者在这个会议上的使命是奠定国与国之间更加健康的、真正的和平关系的基础。
    苏联人民在进行了伟大的社会主义革命、把政权掌握在自己手中之后，就铺设了建设新社会的道路。苏联人民由于遵循马克思列宁主义的学说，取得了伟大的成果。现在，欧洲和亚洲的许多国家的人民也正沿着这条道路前进。他们正在发展本国的社会主义的经济、文化、科学技术，形象地说，他们摆脱了资本主义的引力，正在消除剥削制度的残余和习惯，并且走上了自己的社会主义轨道，现在正沿着建设共产主义的康庄大道勇往直前。
    现在，苏联和所有社会主义国家取得了如此辉煌的成就，为进一步迅速发展创造了一切条件，在我们这些国家中培养了人民知识分子，在马克思列宁主义政党的领导下，建设新生活的新人也成长壮大起来了，难道在这个时候，已经衰老的资本主义世界还能赶上我们不断前进的社会主义世界吗？
    帝国主义阻挡不了社会主义国家的发展，社会主义国家正满怀信心地向着人类光明的未来——共产主义前进。
