    The busy season for harvesting summer crops has begun. News of good harvests of rapeseed and wheat are frequently coming from the South. In the North, winter wheat will soon be reaped. Making good preparations for wheat harvesting and ensuring a bumper harvest is a major task in current agricultural production.
    Doing a good job in the summer harvest and reaping the fruits of the summer bumper harvest is of great economic and political significance. This year, the area of ​​overwintering summer harvest crops has increased by 110 million mu compared to last year, of which winter wheat has increased by 50 million mu. Except for a few disaster-stricken areas (mainly drought), the summer harvest crops are growing well in various places. Bringing in the bountiful summer grain and oil crops will lay an important foundation for completing and overfulfilling the annual agricultural production plan.
    Summer harvesting is like "snatching grain from the dragon's mouth," and is highly seasonal. For example, wheat has only a few short days for the most suitable harvest period. If the harvest is delayed, it will cause a large amount of "fallen ears" loss, and may also suffer from wind and rain disasters. Summer harvest and summer planting are closely linked. If summer harvest is delayed, it will also hinder timely summer planting. Therefore, summer harvest has always been a tense battle on the agricultural front. This year, the area of ​​summer harvest crops is very large, the crops are good and dense, and many large-scale high-yield fields have been established in various places, with thousands, tens of thousands, or even tens of thousands of mu of crops planted in contiguous areas maturing at the same time, which must be harvested at the same time, and its intensity will exceed that of previous years. In order to successfully complete the summer harvest task, the Party committees in various places should conduct in-depth ideological mobilization among the broad masses of people's communes and state farms, so that everyone understands the characteristics of this year's summer harvest and the great significance of striving for a bumper harvest, boost their soaring enthusiasm, and properly prepare for the summer harvest, and meet this struggle.
    The basic requirements of the summer harvest work are timely harvesting, careful and meticulous work, and ensuring every grain is stored in the granary. It is necessary to harvest as soon as a piece is ripe, harvest carefully, transport quickly, and thresh meticulously, and prevent scattering and spoilage during the harvesting and storage process. Only in this way can we thoroughly realize a comprehensive bumper harvest of summer crops.
    In order to meet this year's summer bumper harvest, the leading organs in various places have grasped the summer harvest preparation work earlier than in previous years, and the preparations have been relatively sufficient and thorough. However, we must not be negligent because of this. The more sufficient the preparation work is, the more we must continue to be cautious and prevent possible loopholes. The harvest season in the main wheat-producing areas is about to begin, and various places should seize the time to conduct a general inspection of the summer harvest preparation work. According to past experience, the shortage of labor is the most prominent problem during the summer harvest. Therefore, special attention should be paid to checking the arrangement of labor and the preparation of wheat harvesting tools. With handy tools, and a sufficient number of new and improved tools with higher efficiency, the contradiction of insufficient labor during the wheat harvest can be fundamentally solved. If it is found that the preparation of tools is insufficient, forces should be immediately organized to take effective measures to rush production. It is entirely possible to complete the preparation of summer harvest tools at the fastest speed. Over the past two years, many advanced summer harvest tools have been created throughout the country, which is an extremely favorable condition. As long as they are manufactured and promoted in large quantities, they can show great power in this year's wheat harvest. The agricultural machinery factories and farm tool factories run by the communes throughout the vast rural areas are growing rapidly, and their manufacturing and technical strength has been greatly enhanced. This is another extremely favorable condition for accelerating tool reform. In the rush production of summer harvest tools, the commune-run industry will be able to play a huge role.
    Realizing a summer bumper harvest is a major event for 500 million farmers, and also a major event for the people of the whole country. All walks of life and urban residents should vigorously support the summer harvest work in various aspects; and various regions and within the people's communes should further promote the communist style, carry out large-scale cooperation on the principle of equal value and mutual benefit, and jointly complete the summer harvest task.
    The busy summer harvest is about to begin, and time is very tight. For the past seven or eight months, under the leadership of the Party and relying on the great power of the people's communes, the broad masses of farmers have overcome severe drought and other natural disasters, and have carried out careful cultivation and management of summer harvest crops, and have created great achievements. We should make one last effort to get all the fruits of the harvest, and make every effort to strive for a comprehensive victory of bumper harvest. We must win this victory cleanly and thoroughly.

### 夏收开始了

    夏收开始了
    夏熟作物的收获旺季开始了。南方的油菜、小麦丰收喜讯频频传来。北方的冬小麦即将开镰收割。努力做好收麦准备，保证丰产丰收，是当前农业生产上一项重大任务。
    做好夏收工作，把夏季大丰收的果实拿到手，有重大的经济意义和政治意义。今年的越冬夏收作物面积比去年增加了一亿一千万亩，其中的冬小麦增加了五千万亩。除少数受灾（主要是旱灾）地区外，各地的夏收作物生长都很好。把丰收的夏粮和油料都收回来，将为完成和超额完成全年农业生产计划打下一个重要的基础。
    夏收工作如“龙口夺粮”，季节性最强。比如小麦，最适当的收获期只有短短的几天，收获迟了，会造成大量“落镰”的损失，还可能遭受风灾和雨灾。夏收和夏种紧密相连，夏收迟了，还会妨碍适时夏种。所以夏收历来都是农业战线上的一场紧张的战斗。今年夏收作物面积很大，庄稼又好又密，加上各地建立了许多大面积丰产田，几千亩、上万亩甚至几万亩连片种植的庄稼一齐成熟，必须同时收割，其紧张程度更要超过往年。为了胜利完成夏收任务，各地党委应当向人民公社和国营农场的广大群众进行深入的思想动员，使人人了解今年夏收的特点和争取丰产丰收的重大意义，鼓起冲天干劲，妥善地作好夏收的准备工作，迎接这场斗争。
    夏收工作的基本要求，是收获适时，精打细打，颗粒归仓。一定要做到熟一块收一块，细收快运细打，随收割随运输随脱粒，防止收获和保管过程中的抛撒霉烂。只有这样，才算彻底实现了夏收作物全面丰产丰收。
    为了迎接今年的夏季大丰收，各地领导机关对夏收准备工作抓的都比往年早，准备的也比较充分周到。但是，绝不能因而疏忽大意。越是准备工作比较充分，越要继续谨慎小心，防止可能出现的漏洞。主要产麦区的收获季节就要开始了，各地应该抓紧时间，普遍进行一次夏收准备工作的大检查。根据历年的经验，夏收期间劳动力不足是个最突出的问题。因此，要特别注意检查劳动力的安排和麦收工具的准备情况，有了应手的工具，有了效能更高的足够数量的新式工具和改良工具，才能从根本上解决麦收期间劳动力不足的矛盾。发现工具准备不足时，应该马上组织力量，采取有效措施，赶制赶造。用最快的速度完成夏收工具的准备工作是完全可能的。两年多来，全国各地已经创造了许多先进的夏收工具，这是一个极为有利的条件，只要大量制造推广就可以在今年的麦收中大显威力。遍布广大农村的公社经营的农业机械厂和农具厂，正在迅速成长，它们的制造力量和技术力量已经大大增强。这是加速工具改革的又一个极为有利的条件。在赶制夏收工具中，社办工业必能发挥巨大的作用。
    实现夏季大丰收，是五亿农民的大事情，也是全国人民的大事情。各行各业和城镇居民应当从各个方面大力支援夏收工作；各地区间和人民公社内部要进一步发扬共产主义风格，在等价互利的原则下开展大协作，共同完成夏收任务。
    夏收大忙马上就要到来，时间很紧迫了。七、八个月来，广大农民在党的领导下，依靠人民公社的伟大力量，战胜了严重的干旱和其他自然灾害，对于夏收作物进行了精心的培育管理，创造了伟大的成绩。我们应当再努最后一把力，把丰收的果实全部拿到手，千方百计下决心争取丰产丰收的全面胜利。一定要干净彻底地夺取这个胜利。（附图片）
