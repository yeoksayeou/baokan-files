Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 26th: Newspapers in Shenyang have recently received a large number of letters from readers expressing support for the Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.

　　A reader from Kaiyuan County named Song Wenyun analyzed the aggressive nature of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" in his letter to the newspaper. He pointed out that this aggressive military treaty would bring profound disasters to the Japanese people. He emphasized: "The Chinese people, who have suffered deeply from the past persecution by Japanese fascists, deeply sympathize with the plight of the Japanese people, and we will never allow American imperialism to tie the Japanese people to the chariot of aggression again."

　　Ding Bigui, a demobilized soldier from the Lingbei People's Commune in Shenyang, reflected the wishes of the demobilized soldiers around him in his letter. He said that his comrades have enough experience to prove that American imperialism and all reactionaries are indeed paper tigers; they bully the weak and fear the strong. Only by resolutely struggling against the American and Japanese reactionaries can the Japanese people strive to make Japan embark on the road of independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality. He also pointed out that the Japanese people's path of struggle is bright.

　　Many readers recounted in their letters the bloody crimes of Japanese militarism's long-term rule over the people of Northeast China fifteen years ago. Guo Haiming, a first-class hero of the People's Police, and others said in their letters: In the past, under the rule of Japanese fascists, we suffered all kinds of humiliation and were reduced to poverty, with wives and children scattered, living worse than animals. If Japanese militarism is allowed to revive, not only will the Japanese people suffer the hardships of war again, but it will also bring serious threats to the peace-loving people of Asian countries. We must unite closely with the Japanese people and resolutely oppose American imperialism's revival of Japanese militarism!

    怒斥美日反动派的战争阴谋
    据新华社沈阳26日电　沈阳市的报纸最近收到了读者表示支援日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约斗争的大量来信。
    开原县的一位名叫宋文运的读者在给报纸的信中分析了日美“安全条约”的侵略性质。他指出，这一侵略性的军事条约将会给日本人民带来深重的灾难。他强调指出：“饱受过去日本法西斯迫害的中国人民深深同情日本人民的处境，我们绝不容许美帝国主义再把日本人民拴到侵略战车上”。
    沈阳陵北人民公社的复员军人丁必桂在他的信中，反映了他周围复员军人的心愿，他说，他的战友们有足够的经验证明：美帝国主义和一切反动派确实是纸老虎，它们欺软怕硬，日本人民只有与美日反动派坚决斗争，才能争取到使日本走上独立、民主、和平和中立的道路。他还指出，日本人民的斗争道路是光明的。
    很多读者在来信中叙述了日本军国主义十五年前长期统治东北人民的血腥罪恶。人民警察一等功臣郭海明等人的信上说：过去我们在日本法西斯统治下，饱受了各种凌辱和倾家荡产、妻离子散、生活不如牛马的苦痛，如果让日本军国主义复活，不仅日本人民会再度遭受战争的苦难，而且对亚洲国家的和平人民也带来了严重的威胁。我们和日本人民紧密团结起来，坚决反对美帝国主义复活日本军国主义！
