Xinhua News Agency, 7th Dispatch: Metallurgical industry departments across the country are vigorously constructing non-ferrous metal "small foreign group" enterprises. These enterprises include small-scale mining and ore dressing plants for various non-ferrous metal mines, small copper smelters, small aluminum plants, and small alumina plants. By the beginning of April this year, more than one hundred have been built nationwide, over four hundred are under construction, and another batch is actively preparing to commence. Shandong, Hebei, Anhui, Hunan, Sichuan, and other provinces where work is progressing faster, have already commenced construction on more than half of the non-ferrous metal "small foreign group" enterprises planned for the first half of this year.

To meet the needs of the high-speed development of industries such as steel, electricity, and machinery, as well as various sectors of the national economy, the non-ferrous metal industry must correspondingly develop at a high speed. For more than a year, various regions have implemented the development policy of "simultaneous development of large, medium, and small enterprises in the non-ferrous metal industry, with small and medium enterprises as the mainstay." They have already built a batch of non-ferrous metal "small foreign group" enterprises, which have played a significant role in increasing the output of non-ferrous metals and promoting agricultural mechanization and the development of the electricity and machinery industries. However, the non-ferrous metal industry still cannot meet the needs of the sustained leap forward in the national economy. Therefore, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has determined that this year, while constructing large and medium-sized non-ferrous metal enterprises, all regions across the country must vigorously promote the production and construction of non-ferrous metal "small foreign groups" like they did with the steel "small foreign groups." Various measures should be taken to build a large number of new non-ferrous metal "small foreign group" enterprises this year.

In accordance with this requirement, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry recently held a special meeting to discuss issues related to the vigorous construction of non-ferrous metal "small foreign groups" and organized six working groups to go to various regions to assist in the production and construction of non-ferrous metal "small foreign groups." The metallurgical industry departments of various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have also formulated phased construction plans and organized specialized teams to engage in this work. During the construction process, various regions resolutely implemented the policy of self-reliance and combining foreign and indigenous methods, overcoming difficulties in equipment, materials, and other aspects by every possible means, and creating many new records of high-speed construction. The builders of the Pingshizhuang Copper Mine in Hebei Province, starting from breaking ground on February 16th, built a small ore dressing plant capable of processing 50 tons of copper ore per day in just fifteen days. The project quality fully met the design requirements, and the investment was 30% lower than planned, becoming a red flag for the construction of small mining and ore dressing plants in the national non-ferrous metal industry. A lead-zinc mine in Hunan Province built two small ore dressing plants, each capable of processing 50 tons of ore per day, in twenty-two days. A copper mine in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region also built an ore dressing plant capable of processing 200 tons of ore per day in just twenty-four days. However, in 1959, it generally took about two months to build a small non-ferrous metal mining and ore dressing plant, and the fastest took three to four weeks.

Judging from a batch of non-ferrous metal "small foreign group" enterprises that have been built and put into production across the country, these enterprises, like other "small foreign group" enterprises in other industries, not only have the advantages of fast construction, low investment, easy manufacturing of equipment, and the ability to fully utilize decentralized resources; but also, after being put into production, the operating technology is easy for workers to master and progresses rapidly. Many small factories have achieved high yield, high quality, low consumption, and longevity in a short period of time, just like large non-ferrous metal enterprises. Taking the technical indicators of small aluminum plants as an example: In March this year, the average utilization coefficient of electrolysis cells in small aluminum plants nationwide (the amount of aluminum produced per square meter of anode area per day and night) has increased by 30% compared to a year ago. Among them, the utilization coefficient of some advanced factories has approached, caught up with, and even exceeded that of large aluminum plants. Due to the continuous improvement of output and quality, and the significant reduction of raw material consumption, the production cost of small aluminum plants is now about half lower than a year ago.

### 各地大力发展有色金属“小洋群”  已经建成炼铜、制铝等小厂一百多座，还有四百多座正加紧施工

    各地大力发展有色金属“小洋群”
    已经建成炼铜、制铝等小厂一百多座，还有四百多座正加紧施工
    新华社7日讯　全国各地冶金工业部门，正在大规模地建设有色金属“小洋群”企业。这些企业包括各种有色金属矿的小型采选厂、小炼铜厂、小铝厂、小铝氧厂等，到今年4月初止，全国已经建成了一百多座，有四百多座正在施工，还有一批积极准备动工。工作进行得较快的山东、河北、安徽、湖南、四川等省，今年已经动工建设的有色金属“小洋群”企业的座数，都达到了今年上半年计划建设的一半以上。
    适应钢铁、电力、机械等工业和国民经济各部门高速度发展的需要，有色金属工业必须相应地高速度发展。一年多以来，各地贯彻执行了有色金属工业“大中小企业并举，以中小企业为主”的发展方针，已经建设了一批有色金属“小洋群”企业，这对于提高有色金属的产量，促进农业机械化和电力、机械工业的发展，起了很大的作用。但是，有色金属工业还不能满足国民经济持续跃进的需要。因此，冶金工业部确定，今年在建设大中型有色金属企业的同时，全国各地都要像抓钢铁“小洋群”那样，大抓有色金属“小洋群”的生产建设工作，要采取各种措施，在今年内新建一大批有色金属“小洋群”企业。
    根据这一要求，冶金工业部最近曾经专门召开会议，讨论了大力建设有色金属“小洋群”的有关问题，并且组织了六个工作组，分赴各地协助进行有色金属“小洋群”的生产建设。各省、市、自治区的冶金工业部门，也都制订了分批建设的计划，组织专门力量从事这一工作。在建设的过程中，各地坚决贯彻执行自力更生、洋土结合的方针，千方百计地克服设备、材料等困难，创造了许多高速度建设的新纪录。河北省平市庄铜矿的建设者们，从2月16日破土动工起，仅仅用十五天时间，就建成了一座每天可以处理五十吨铜矿石的小型选矿厂，工程质量完全符合设计要求，投资也比计划节约了30％，成为全国有色金属工业小型采选厂建设的一面红旗。湖南省有一个铅锌矿，在二十二天时间内，建成了两座每天各处理矿石五十吨的小型采选厂；新疆维吾尔自治区有一个铜矿，也只用二十四天时间，就建成了一座每天处理二百吨矿石的选矿厂。但是，在1959年，建设一座小型的有色金属采选厂，一般需要两个月左右，最快的也要三、四十天。
    从各地已经建成和投入生产的一批有色金属“小洋群”企业看来，这些企业不仅像其他行业的“小洋群”企业一样，具有建设快、投资省、设备容易制造、能够充分利用分散的资源等优点；而且在投入生产后，操作技术易于为工人所掌握，进步很快，许多小厂已经在短短的时间内，和大型有色金属企业一样做到了高产、优质、低耗和长寿。以小铝厂的技术指标为例：今年3月份，全国小铝厂电解槽的平均利用系数（每平方米阳极面积每昼夜的产铝量），已经比一年以前提高了30％，其中一些先进厂的利用系数已经接近、赶上甚至超过了大型铝厂。由于产量、质量不断提高，原材料的消耗大幅度地降低，目前小铝厂的生产成本，也比一年前降低了一半左右。
