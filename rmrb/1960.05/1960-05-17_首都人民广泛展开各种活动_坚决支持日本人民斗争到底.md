Xinhua News Agency, 16th dispatch: Following the grand rally and demonstration of over one million people in Beijing on the 9th, the people of the entire city have launched even more extensive and in-depth activities to fully support the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle against the U.S.-Japan alliance treaty.

In recent days, the people of the entire city have been eagerly reading newspapers and listening to the radio, paying close attention to the struggle of the Japanese people with extraordinary excitement. Many workers hold discussions in workshops after taking off their work clothes. Many students and cadres write big-character posters, put up wall newspapers, and draw cartoons. In universities such as Tsinghua University and the Central Academy of Drama, the school radio station broadcasts news about the Japanese people's anti-imperialist and patriotic struggle every noon. When the news of the strike of 4.6 million Japanese workers came, people spread the word. Tens of thousands of students at Tsinghua University held class discussions, and many students spoke at the meetings, expressing their full support for the just struggle of the Japanese people. In recent days, Beijing's newspapers have received a large number of letters from readers. Among the many letters received by the "Beijing Daily" were those written by steelworkers, shop assistants, cadres, Young Pioneers, and patients in hospitals. A miner from Jingxi Coal Mine wrote a letter expressing support for the struggle of the Japanese Miike coal miners, saying: "Chinese miners resolutely stand behind you and strongly support your struggle. We believe that your struggle will surely achieve final victory." Workers from the Chengzi Coal Mine of the Jingxi Mining Bureau held five discussion meetings tonight. Coal miners, transportation workers, and construction workers who participated in the discussion unanimously condemned the U.S.-Japan reactionaries' conspiracy to plan a new war and expressed their firm support for the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle.

The peasants of the Lugouqiao People's Commune in the suburbs, who witnessed the "July 7th" Incident in 1937, are even more angry at the U.S.-Japan reactionaries' conspiracy to plan a new war. After the commune members recently held a demonstration parade on the Lugouqiao Bridge, the commune's amateur theater troupe also rehearsed literary and artistic programs such as "Down with the U.S.-Japan Reactionaries." These programs exposed the Japanese militarists' heinous crimes of manufacturing the "July 7th" Incident and invading China, and expressed the strong will of all commune members to oppose the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. The blackboards of each production team also published special issues against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, expressing firm support for the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle.

At present, the number of people in Beijing participating in the struggle to support the Japanese people against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty is increasing. Among them are workers, peasants, university students, cadres, elderly people with white hair, and children. The staff of the Research Institute of Culture and History, located in Beihai Park, have held two consecutive discussion meetings since the 11th. Elderly scholars and painters in their seventies and eighties came to participate in the discussions. More than 20 elderly people focused on discussing the People's Daily editorial "No 'Misunderstanding' at All." Some elderly people exposed the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism and the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke clique during the discussions. Some elderly people also cited the ambitious remarks of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries in recent years, refuting Kishi Nobusuke's fallacy that the large-scale demonstrations by the Chinese people against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty were "a misunderstanding of the security treaty."

The vast number of children also held various activities to resolutely oppose the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. The students of Class One, Grade Five of Beijing No. 2 Experimental Primary School held a gathering on the afternoon of the 13th with the theme of opposing the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. At the meeting, the children wrote a letter to the Japanese children, saying: "Dear Japanese children, U.S. imperialism and its running dog Kishi Nobusuke have destroyed your happy lives, leaving you without a good learning environment, and hunger and death are constantly threatening you. We Chinese children fully support your struggle and will always stand with you against the U.S.-Japan reactionaries."

Poets, painters, and musicians in Beijing have also taken action to write poems and create paintings to support the Japanese people's just struggle. Guo Moruo and Tian Han have written poems praising the heroic struggle of the Japanese people. Guo Moruo wrote in a poem titled "To the Japanese People": "The people of the Three Islands are rising up today, and the opinions of the five continents are looking forward to it. Expelling the invaders and fighting for democracy, the rising sun shines on the top of Mount Fuji."

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 16th dispatch: The people of various places in Hebei Province have held rallies in recent days to severely condemn the crime of U.S. imperialism supporting Japanese militarism and threatening peace in Asia and the world, and to firmly support the Japanese people's just struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.

Since the 10th, Tianjin, Zhangjiakou, Zunhua County and other places have held rallies and various activities to support the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic and just struggle. Forty demobilized soldiers from the Xixiaying People's Commune in Zunhua County jointly wrote a protest letter. They said: "The aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism will not change. It failed in the war of aggression against Korea and now wants to rearm Japanese militarism. We want to warn U.S. imperialism: those who play with fire will burn themselves."

Qiu Rongxiang, a member of the Beijing-Tianjin Highway People's Commune, said at a rally: "U.S. imperialism attempts to support Japanese militarism and vainly tries to act like a bully. This is a dream. We resolutely support the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle to smash the conspiracy of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries."

In Tianjin, from the bustling streets to the remote alleys, literary and artistic workers from various professional and amateur art groups have been performing live plays that they created to oppose the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and support the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle. After their performances, tens of thousands of people expressed their desire to support the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle until the final victory.

    严厉谴责美日反动派策划新战争的罪行
    新华社16日讯　北京继9日一百多万人举行大集会大示威以后，全市人民更加广泛深入地展开各种活动，全力支持日本人民反对日美同盟条约的爱国正义斗争。
    近几天来，全市人民每天都争着看报纸、听广播，怀着异常激奋的心情，关注着日本人民的斗争情况。许多工人下班后刚刚脱下工作服，就坐在车间里举行座谈会。许多学生和机关干部写大字报，出壁报，画漫画。在清华大学、中央戏剧学院等高等院校，学校广播台每天中午都着重广播日本人民反帝爱国斗争的消息。当日本四百六十万工人大罢工的消息传来时，人们奔走相告。清华大学上万学生举行班级座谈会，许多学生在会上发言，表示全力支援日本人民的正义斗争。连日来，北京各报社都接到大批读者来信。“北京日报”社收到的许多来信中，有钢铁工人、商店售货员、机关干部、少先队员和住医院的病人写的。京西煤矿一位矿工写信表示支援日本三池煤矿工人的斗争，信中说：“中国矿工坚决作你们的后盾，有力地支援你们的斗争，我们相信，你们的斗争一定能取得最后的胜利。”京西矿务局城子煤矿工人今晚分五处举行了座谈会。参加座谈会的采煤工人、运输工人和基建工人们，一致谴责美日反动派策划新战争的阴谋，表示坚决支持日本人民的爱国正义斗争。
    郊区芦沟桥人民公社的农民，是1937年“七七”事变的目击者，他们对美日反动派策划新战争的阴谋更是愤怒。社员们最近在芦沟桥上举行了示威游行后，公社的业余剧团还排练了“打倒美日反动派”等文艺节目。这些节目揭露了日本军国主义当年制造“七七”事变侵略中国的滔天罪行，表达了全体社员反对日美军事同盟条约的坚强意志。各生产队的黑板报也出了反对日美军事同盟条约的专刊，表示坚决支持日本人民的爱国正义斗争。
    目前，北京参加支援日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约斗争的人愈来愈广泛。其中有工人、农民、大学生、机关干部，也有白发苍苍的老人和少年儿童。座落在北海公园里的文史研究馆的人员，从11日起连续举行了两次座谈会。七、八十岁的老学者、老画家都来参加座谈。二十多位老人着重讨论了人民日报社论“丝毫没有‘误解’”。有些老人在讨论中，揭露了美帝国主义和日本岸信介集团的侵略本性。有的老人还列举近年来美日反动派野心勃勃的言论，驳斥了岸信介公然把中国人民反对日美军事同盟条约的大示威说成“是对于安全条约的误解”的谬论。
    广大少年儿童也举行各种活动，坚决反对日美军事同盟条约。北京市第二实验小学五年级一班学生在13日下午举行了一次以反对日美军事同盟条约为主题的集会。会上，少年儿童们给日本少年儿童写了一封信，信中说：“亲爱的日本小朋友，美帝国主义及其走狗岸信介破坏了你们的幸福生活，使你们没有很好的学习环境，饥饿和死亡又时刻威胁着你们。我们中国少年儿童完全支持你们的斗争，并永远和你们站在一起，反对美日反动派。”
    北京的诗人、画家和音乐家也都行动起来，写诗作画支援日本人民的正义斗争。郭沫若和田汉等都写诗歌颂日本人民的英勇斗争。郭沫若在题为“寄日本人民”的诗中写道：“三岛民情今厥起，五洲舆论正瞻望。驱逐寇盗争民主，富士山头旭日光。”
    新华社天津16日电　河北省各地人民连日来纷纷举行集会，严厉谴责美帝国主义扶植日本军国主义威胁亚洲及世界和平的罪行，坚决支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的正义斗争。

    京津公路人民公社社员丘荣香在集会上说：“美帝国主义企图扶植日本军国主义，妄想横行霸道，这是梦想。我们坚决支持日本人民的爱国正义斗争，粉碎日美反动派的阴谋。”
    在天津市，从繁华的街道到偏僻的小巷，各专业和业余艺术团体的文艺工作者，连日演出他们创作的反对日美军事同盟条约、支持日本人民爱国正义斗争的活报剧。他们演出后，成千上万名群众表示，要支持日本人民爱国正义斗争到最后胜利。
