Xinhua News Agency, May 21st:  The People's Liberation Army's cultural learning upsurge, aimed at popularizing middle and higher education among all officers within ten years, is continuing to develop relentlessly. A situation of eagerness to learn and the emergence of model individuals is appearing everywhere. In just over a year, the army's cultural education work has achieved significant accomplishments.

The characteristics of this learning upsurge are its rapid momentum, large scale, and rapid development. Party committees at all levels personally grasp teaching, run schools, and explore rules, quickly establishing spare-time universities, middle schools, and primary schools. Various learning methods, mainly in-service learning, have been widely adopted. Wherever there are officers and soldiers, there are spare-time cultural schools. A huge teaching force, including full-time and part-time teachers, has quickly been organized. Officers and soldiers seize every available moment to study, ensuring that books are carried at all times and learning takes place whenever there is free time.

In the mass learning movement, Party committees of various units have found a way to achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results in the army's cultural education. Over the past year, various units have focused on in-service learning, supplemented by concentrated training; unified leadership, decentralized management; and simultaneous development of universities, middle schools, and primary schools. Based on the officers' existing education levels and work situations, they have been organized in various forms, with different learning schedules and requirements, which has greatly ensured the learning of all types of officers. The teaching organizations and methods of many units adapt to changes in work tasks, being flexible in size and organization. Where garrisons are concentrated, classes are held at the battalion or regimental level; where garrisons are dispersed, classes are held at the company level. Construction units implement "decentralized schooling" and "rotating shifts for classes." People's armed forces cadres, "make concentrated efforts in the bureau, and consolidate when in the countryside." In some units, teachers "deliver lessons to the door," and students send representatives to "receive lessons." When office cadres go to the grassroots, individuals bring learning tasks; several people together form learning groups; and large groups establish temporary schools. In terms of learning time, a combination of regular study and intensive study is adopted, learning more during slack periods and less during busy periods, to achieve "a long stream of water, never cut off" in learning. This set of specific methods adapted to in-service learning effectively guarantees the high-speed, high-quality, and long-term persistence of the army's cultural education.

The PLA's cultural education movement is filled with a revolutionary spirit of daring to think and daring to act. Many units compile their own teaching materials, make their own teaching aids, and are not bound by conventional teaching rules. According to needs, cadres at all levels focus on intensive study or first learn one or two courses, quickly achieving the effect of applying what they learn.

The vigorous development of cultural education has already begun to have a practical effect on the work of the troops and the military and political studies of cadres. A large number of cadres who are both red and expert, proficient in both military and civilian affairs, are growing up at high speed, greatly accelerating the pace of all officers and soldiers in striving to climb the peak of military science and technology, and powerfully promoting the modernization of our army.

    奋勇攀登军事科学技术高峰
    全军掀起文化学习高潮
    据新华社21日讯　人民解放军以十年为期在全军干部中普及中等教育和高等教育的文化学习热潮，正在持续不懈地向前发展。好学成风、标兵林立的局面到处出现。仅仅一年多的时间，全军的文化教育工作已经取得重大成就。
    这个学习高潮的特点是来势猛，规模大，发展迅速。各级党委亲手抓教学，抓办学，摸规律，迅速建立起业余大学、中学和小学。以在职学习为主的各种学习方法，被广泛采用。哪里有干部和士兵，哪里就有业余文化学校。一支包括专职和兼职教员在内的巨大的教员队伍很快组织起来。官兵们争分夺秒，抓紧一切可以利用的时间学习，作到书本随身带，有空学起来。
    各部队党委在大搞群众学习运动中，找到了一条部队文化教育多快好省的道路。一年多来，各部队以在职学习为主，集训为辅；统一领导，分级管理；大、中、小学并举，按照干部现有文化程度和工作情况，用各种形式把他们分别组织起来，提出不同的学习进度和要求，对于保证各类干部的学习起了很大作用。许多部队的教学组织，教学方式，都适应工作任务的变化，可大可小，可分可合。驻地集中的，以营、团为单位上课；驻地分散的，就以连为单位上课。施工部队，实行“分点办学”、“轮班上课”。人民武装干部，“在局突击，下乡巩固”。有些部队，教员“送课上门”，学员派代表“领课”。机关干部下部队，单个人就带学习任务；几个人一道，就编成学习小组，成批人去，就办临时学校。在学习时间上，采取经常学习与突击学习相结合，闲时多学，忙时少学，作到学习上的“长流水，不断线”。这一套适应在职学习的具体办法，有效地保证了部队文化教育的高速优质和长期坚持。
    解放军文化教育运动充满了敢想敢干的革命精神。许多单位自编教材，自制教具，不受教学陈规的约束。各级干部根据需要，有重点地突击或先学一门或两门课程，迅速收到学以致用的效果。
    文化教育的蓬勃发展，已经开始对部队工作以及干部的军事、政治学习发生实际效果，大批红专兼备、文武双全的干部高速度成长起来，大大加速了全军官兵奋勇攀登军事科学技术高峰的步伐，有力地促进了我军现代化建设。
