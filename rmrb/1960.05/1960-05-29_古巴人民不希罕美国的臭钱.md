    The Cuban People Don't Covet America's Tainted Money
    Commentator of this newspaper
    Only two days after Eisenhower boasted in a radio address that the United States was determined to promote a "constructive plan to improve the lives of people in emerging countries throughout the world" through "aid," the U.S. State Department announced its decision to halt all economic "aid" to Cuba. This is a most typical case of "saying one thing and doing another."
    Needless to say, the Washington authorities want to use this perfidious behavior to exert economic pressure on Cuba. In the eyes of the American masters, others cannot survive without American "charity." Therefore, stopping "aid" to Cuba will help achieve the goals that the United States has failed to achieve in the past by using all means: forcing the Cuban people to submit. The U.S. ruling clique has obviously miscalculated again.
    Do the Cuban people, who have already stood up, covet a few tainted dollars from the United States? The Cuban people can no longer tolerate the American acts of plunder and enslavement through "aid." They are now firmly taking a new road of self-reliance while preventing foreign exploitation. Of course, the Cuban people do not reject aid from others, but what they need is sincere help. The head of the Cuban National Bank, Guevara, announced not long ago: "Cuba does not need dollars" because Cuba "can use our sugar to buy goods based on barter trade." The Cuban "National Daily" also expressed the Cuban people's awe-inspiring spirit, writing: The people of Latin America have seen how quickly Cuba can advance its cause without "American aid." The U.S. ruling clique's attempt to stop the development of the Cuban revolution by stopping "aid" can only expose its imperialist ambition of aggression.
    According to the U.S. State Department, the reason why the United States wants to stop "aid" to Cuba is because it believes that continuing to "aid" Cuba would be "incompatible with the interests of the United States and this hemisphere." In this way, Washington completely exposed the beautiful tricks of "American aid." It turns out that the so-called "helping backward countries develop" and "improving the lives of people in various countries" are nothing but deceptive nonsense. Everything is based on the interests of the United States. This is what the Cuban people have long seen. Didn't the Cuban "National Daily" once point out: "The so-called 'aid' provided by the United States is not for the benefit of all American countries but for Wall Street itself?" The Wall Street bosses believe that Cuba under Batista's dictatorial rule is in their interests (although it has been proven that it is not in the interests of the Cuban people), so they give "American aid"; the Cuban people have won the revolutionary victory, which is not in their interests (although it has been proven that it is in the interests of the Cuban people), so they stop giving "American aid." It can also be clearly seen from here that the interests of the Cuban people are completely incompatible with the interests of the Wall Street bosses. The U.S. ruling clique, for the sake of Wall Street's interests, is trying every possible means to strangle the Cuban revolution. Over the past year or so, interference methods have emerged one after another, and now they have come up with the trick of stopping "American aid." But just as all previous U.S. conspiracies to interfere in the Cuban revolution have failed, this move is also bound to fail. Cuban Prime Minister Castro said in a television speech on the evening of the 27th when talking about the United States stopping "aid" to Cuba: The Cuban revolution is already an invincible reality. For every conspiracy the enemy hatches, the revolution will do ten things. The enemy will always be defeated by the facts.
    Let the Wall Street bosses count the tainted copper coins in their pockets. The Cuban people will continue to advance their revolutionary cause without looking back.

    古巴人民不希罕美国的臭钱
    本报评论员
    就在艾森豪威尔在广播演说中大事吹嘘美国决心通过“援助”“在全世界推行改善新兴国家人民生活的建设性计划”之后两天，美国国务院宣布决定停止对古巴的一切经济“援助”。这真是最典型不过的
  “说的是一套，做的是一套”。
    不用说，华盛顿当局是想用这种背信弃义的行为来对古巴施加经济压力的。在美国老爷看来，别人不靠美国的“施舍”就活不成，因此，停止对古巴的“援助”，将有助于达到美国过去用尽各种手段所未能达到的目的：迫使古巴人民屈服。美国统治集团这一下显然又打错算盘了。
    已经站起来了的古巴人民会希罕美国的几个臭钱吗？古巴人民对于美国通过“援助”进行掠夺和奴役的行为再也不能忍受了，他们现在坚定地走着自力更生同时也不让外国盘剥的新道路。当然古巴人民也不拒绝别人的援助，但是他们需要的是竭诚相助，古巴国家银行行长格瓦拉不久以前就曾宣布：“古巴不需要美元”，因为古巴“可以根据换货交易用我们的食糖来购买”。古巴的“国民日报”也表露过古巴人民的凛然气概，它写道：拉丁美洲人民已经看到，古巴在没有“美援”的情况下能够以怎样的速度把自己的事业向前推进。美国统治集团妄想以停止“援助”来阻止古巴革命的发展，只能暴露它帝国主义的侵略野心。
    据美国国务院说，美国所以要停止对古巴的“援助”，是因为认定继续“援助”古巴将是“不符合美国和本半球的利益”的。这样华盛顿就完全揭穿了“美援”的那些漂亮的花招。原来所谓“帮助落后国家发展”、“改善各国人民生活”云云都不过是骗人鬼话，一切从美国的利益出发才是实情。而这是古巴人民早就看到了的。古巴“国民日报”不是曾经指出过：“美国进行的所谓‘援助’不是为了所有美洲国家的利益而是为了华尔街自己”吗？华尔街老板认为古巴在巴蒂斯塔的独裁统治下是符合他们利益的（虽然已经证明它是不符合古巴人民利益的），就给予“美援”；古巴人民取得了革命胜利是不符合他们利益的（虽然已经证明它是符合古巴人民利益的），就停止给予“美援”。从这里也可以清楚地看到，古巴人民的利益同华尔街老板的利益是完全水火不相容的。美国统治集团为了华尔街的利益，正在千方百计企图扼杀古巴的革命，一年多来干涉的手段层出不穷，现在又想出停止“美援”这未一招。但是正如美国过去一切干涉古巴革命的阴谋都不能得逞一样，这一着也肯定要失败的。古巴总理卡斯特罗27日晚在电视演说中谈到美国停止对古巴的“援助”时说得好：古巴革命已经是一个不可战胜的现实。敌人每搞一个阴谋，革命就要做十件事情。敌人总是要被事实击败的。
    让华尔街老板去数他们口袋中的臭铜钱吧，古巴人民将毫不顾盼地继续把他们的革命事业向前推进。
