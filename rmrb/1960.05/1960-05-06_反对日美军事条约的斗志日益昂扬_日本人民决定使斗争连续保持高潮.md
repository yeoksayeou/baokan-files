Xinhua News Agency, 4th: Tokyo Dispatch: The Japanese people's fighting spirit against the ratification of the new "Security Treaty" is rising higher and higher. The National Council to Prevent Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" today determined the current struggle guidelines, stipulating that an even stronger and more vigorous movement against the ratification of the new "Security Treaty" should be launched.

    The guidelines stipulate that the National Council will launch a signature campaign across the country starting on the 8th to prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty" and demand the dissolution of the Diet. To this end, signature collection points will be set up in major cities across Japan to exceed the goal of collecting ten million signatures.

    The guidelines stipulate that the Japanese people will hold the 16th unified action struggle against the ratification of the new "Security Treaty" from May 9th to 26th, maintaining a continuous climax. From the 9th to the 15th, 5,000 people will be mobilized every day to petition the Diet, and the 14th will be designated as "Concentrated Petition Day," with 100,000 people conducting a large-scale petition to the Diet, followed by a national rally to prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty" and demand the dissolution of the Diet. During this period, trade unions will hold simultaneous strikes and workplace rallies nationwide on the 12th; on the 13th, the National Council will send representatives to the U.S. Embassy in Japan to protest the aggressive military alliance treaty.

    The guidelines also stipulate that the National Council will coordinate with the situation of the struggle within the Diet and launch a nationwide movement against the new "Security Treaty" centered on large-scale strength struggles by trade unions from around the 20th.

Xinhua News Agency, 5th: Tokyo Dispatch: Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi held a leadership meeting of the Liberal Democratic Party on the evening of the 3rd, openly deciding to extend the current Diet session to forcibly approve the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

    Regardless of the strong opposition from the Japanese people and public opinion, the Kishi Nobusuke group also decided to "forcibly deliberate independently" by the ruling party when opposition parties refuse to attend Diet sessions, and rely on the ruling party's majority seats to approve this aggressive military alliance treaty.

    Kishi Nobusuke's confidant, Secretary-General of the Liberal Democratic Party, Shojiro Kawashima, also met with Vice President of the Liberal Democratic Party, Banboku Ohno, today, and agreed to "extend the Diet session by a minimum of one month." The Kishi Nobusuke group plans to have the Liberal Democratic Party pass a resolution to extend the Diet session around the 20th.

    The Japanese Diet is currently engaged in fierce debate over the new "Security Treaty." The current Diet session will expire on May 26th. The Kishi Nobusuke group originally conspired to force the House of Representatives to pass the treaty before April 26th, so that it could complete the legal procedures for ratifying this military alliance treaty before the Diet session closed on May 26th. This is because, according to the Japanese Constitution, if the House of Councillors fails to pass the treaty within thirty days of the Diet's opening, the decision of the House of Representatives will be considered the decision of the Diet. However, the Kishi Nobusuke group's conspiracy has already gone bankrupt under the strong opposition of the Japanese people and public opinion. Now, they are attempting to adopt the means of extending the session to realize the conspiracy to approve this treaty, in order to present a "gift" to U.S. President Eisenhower, who is scheduled to visit Japan on June 19th.

    The Japanese Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and people from all walks of life are launching a nationwide unified action, resolutely opposing the Kishi Nobusuke group's forcing the Diet to approve the new "Security Treaty," and demanding the immediate dissolution of the Diet and the immediate resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet. The Socialist Party also demanded that the Liberal Democratic Party hold public debates on the new "Security Treaty" issue in Tokyo and other places from the 14th to the 18th. The Liberal Democratic Party was finally forced to agree to hold a four-day debate starting on the 13th. At that time, Diet members from both parties will engage in a debate on opposing and insisting on approving the new "Security Treaty."

    Under the influence of the Japanese people's persistent struggle, the divisions existing among the factions within the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party regarding the approval of the new "Security Treaty" have not been eliminated. There are reports that the Ishibashi faction and the Matsumura faction within the Liberal Democratic Party still oppose Kishi Nobusuke's practices of "independent deliberation" and "forcible passage" of the new "Security Treaty."

### 反对日美军事条约的斗志日益昂扬  日本人民决定使斗争连续保持高潮

    反对日美军事条约的斗志日益昂扬
    日本人民决定使斗争连续保持高潮
    岸信介集团公然要延长国会会期强行批准日美条约
    新华社4日讯　东京消息：日本人民反对批准新“安全条约”的斗志日益高昂。阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议今天确定了当前的斗争方针，规定要展开更加强大和猛烈的反对批准新“安全条约”的运动。
    方针规定，国民会议要从8日开始在全国范围内展开阻止批准新“安全条约”和要求解散国会的签名运动。为此，日本各个主要城市将设立签名处，超额完成征集一千万人签名的目标。
    方针规定，日本人民将从5月9日到26日举行第十六次反对批准新“安全条约”统一行动的斗争，连续保持高潮。从9日到15日，每天要动员五千人向国会请愿，并把14日作为“集中请愿日”，向国会进行十万人的大规模请愿，然后举行阻止批准新“安全条约”、要求解散国会的国民大会。在这期间，工会要在12日在全国同时举行罢工和工作场所大会；13日，国民会议将派代表向美国驻日大使馆提出抗议，反对侵略性军事同盟条约。
    方针还规定，国民会议将配合国会内的斗争情况，从20日前后起展开以工会大规模实力斗争为中心的全国性反对新“安全条约”运动。
    新华社5日讯　东京消息：日本首相岸信介3日晚上召开自由民主党首脑会议，公然决定要延长本届国会会期来强行批准新日美“安全条约”。
    不顾日本人民和舆论的强烈反对，岸信介集团还决定要在在野党拒绝出席国会会议的时候不惜由执政党“强行单独审议”，并依靠执政党的多数议席批准这个侵略性军事同盟条约。
    岸信介的亲信、自由民主党干事长川岛正次郎今天还同自由民主党副总裁大野伴睦会谈，商定“最低限度要延长国会会期一个月”。岸信介集团准备在20日前后由自由民主党通过延长国会会期的决议。
    日本国会目前正在就新“安全条约”进行激烈的辩论。这次国会会议将在5月26日期满。岸信介集团原来阴谋在4月26日以前强使众议院通过这项条约，以便能在5月26日国会会议闭幕以前完成批准这个军事同盟条约的法律手续。因为根据日本宪法规定，如果参议院在国会开会的三十天内不能通过这项条约，众议院的决定就算作国会的决定。但是，岸信介集团的这个阴谋已经在日本人民和舆论的强烈反对下破产了。现在，它们又妄图采取延长会期的手段，来实现批准这个条约的阴谋，以便向预定6月19日访问日本的美国总统艾森豪威尔“献礼”。
    日本共产党、社会党和各界人民正在展开全国性统一行动，坚决反对岸信介集团强使国会批准新“安全条约”，并且要求立即解散国会，要求岸信介内阁立即下台。社会党还要求自由民主党从14日到18日在东京和其他地方就新“安全条约”问题举行公开的辩论会。自由民主党最后被迫同意从13日起举行四天的辩论会。届时两党国会议员将就反对和坚持批准新“安全条约”展开论战。
    在日本人民坚持斗争的影响下，日本自由民主党内部各派系在批准新“安全条约”方面所存在的分歧仍未消除。有消息说，自由民主党内的石桥派和松村派仍然反对岸信介的“单独审议”、“强行通过”新“安全条约”的做法。
