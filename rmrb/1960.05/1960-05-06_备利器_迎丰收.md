Prepare Sharp Tools to Welcome a Bountiful Harvest
By Our Reporter Li Desen

After several spring rains, the more than 20 million mu of wheat in Sichuan Province are gradually turning from green to yellow, and the harvest season is approaching.

In mid-March, 200 master craftsmen selected from 19 special districts, autonomous prefectures, and cities in Sichuan Province, brought various summer harvest tools created by the local masses to Nanxi County, which has an earlier season on the banks of the Yangtze River, to perform and compete with each other. In the boundless wheat fields, all kinds of summer harvest tools were lined up in a row, from improved sickles to tractor-drawn automatic harvesters, whether large or small, manual, animal-powered, semi-mechanized, or mechanized... Everything was available, gathered in the fields, each showing its own unique skills.

The rising sun reddened the river water, and the wheat waves undulated. The performance evaluation began. A green hand-cranked harvester galloped in the golden wheat field, attracting much attention. This harvester, which requires only two people to operate, is light and flexible. Wherever it passes, pieces of wheat are immediately piled into many small piles, neat and even. In just one hour, it has harvested 2.2 mu of wheat. Gao Jiancheng, one of the creators of this harvester from the Wenjiang County Agricultural Machinery Bureau, introduced to everyone: "This iron-wood structure harvester only requires two people with semi-labor power to operate. The machine weighs a total of 50 kilograms, with iron parts accounting for only one-fifth. It takes only 14 workdays to manufacture one." These words aroused great interest from the tool reform experts who came to visit. The harvester was immediately surrounded by a crowd. Some measured the various parts, some immediately drew sketches, and some asked to buy one back to use as a "model". This harvester has been repeatedly improved many times during the creation process, and has been tested in more than a dozen places inside and outside the province, and was only recently finalized. Now the Wenjiang County Agricultural Machinery Bureau has manufactured 240 units. The agricultural tool factories of various communes on the western Sichuan Plain are currently concentrating their efforts to rush to manufacture this harvester, which will show its great effect in the upcoming wheat harvest.

Among the large and small, various types of harvesters, there is the smallest harvester—the Fuling sickle-tooth harvester, shuttling back and forth in the wheat field. This harvester is only over one meter high and less than one meter long. Except for the cutting parts, the rest is all wood structure. The whole body weighs only more than 30 kilograms, and the smallest agricultural tool factory can manufacture it. One person pulls and one person shakes the handle, and it can harvest 8 to 10 mu of wheat a day. Various counties in the Fuling Special District are widely promoting its use. The entire special district plans to manufacture 20,000 units this year. Yao Chengrong, the creator of this harvester, said it well: "No matter how high the mountains or how narrow the roads are, it can't stop it." Yao Chengrong pushed it in public with great energy. He didn't know how much effort he had put in and how many sleepless nights he had spent for this harvester. As early as 1958, Yao Chengrong visited Chengdu. This then-director of the agricultural cooperative was struck hard after seeing the combine harvester, and was so worried that he couldn't sleep for several nights. At that time, he thought: "We are shouting for mechanization every day, but who knows that mechanization is such a behemoth, how can our mountainous areas do it, we can only watch it in vain." But he did not give up. He carefully observed the structural principles of the combine harvester, and after returning, he began to study small harvesters. After the communization, the material conditions were better, so he concentrated on agricultural machinery research and trial production. In the past year, he successively made more than 20 prototypes of small harvesters, but all failed. Later, the Party organization transferred experienced workers and technicians to cooperate with him in research and trial production, and finally recently succeeded in making the current small harvester. Visitors from mountainous and remote areas especially liked this harvester. As soon as the performance ended, Yao Chengrong was surrounded by people who rushed to congratulate him on this successful creation of great significance to the people in mountainous areas.

Various fast rice harvesting tools, which were already widely promoted last year, are even more varied this year: there are three-unit, double-unit, spiral, curved, rotating, etc. During the performance, good news kept coming. All harvesters and rice harvesting tools that participated in the performance improved work efficiency by three times, five times, and thirty times compared with the original wheat harvesting methods...

    备利器　迎丰收
    本报记者　李德森
    几番春雨，四川省二千多万亩小麦逐渐由青转黄，收割季节临近了。
    3月中旬，四川省十九个专区、自治州和市选派了二百多名能工巧匠，带着当地群众创造的各式夏收工具，来到了长江边上季节较早的南溪县，互相表演、试比高低。无边无际的麦田里，千奇百怪，各式各样的夏收工具一字儿排列着，从经过改良镰刀到拖拉机牵引的自动收割机，无论大的、小的，人力的，畜力的，半机械化、机械化的……应有尽有，会粹田间，各显神通。
    朝阳映红了江水，麦浪起伏不定。表演评比开始了。一部绿色的手摇收割机，在金黄色的麦田里奔驰，异常引人注目。这部只要两人操作的收割机，轻巧灵便，所过之处，成片的小麦立即堆成许多小堆，整齐而又均匀，时间才过一小时，它已经割完二亩二分地的小麦了。这部收割机是温江县农业机械局创造的，创造人之一的高建成向大家介绍说：“这部铁木结构的收割机，只需要两个具有半劳力的人就可操作，机身共重五十公斤，铁件只占五分之一，制造一部只要十四个工。”这番话引起了前来参观的工具改革能手们的无比兴趣，收割机旁顿时围得水泄不通，有的比量各个部件，有的当下描绘草图，有的要求买一部回去做“样版”。这部收割机在创造过程中，反复改进许多次，曾经在省内外十多个地方进行试验，不久前才初步定型。现在温江县农械局已经制造出二百四十部，川西平原上各个公社的农具厂，目前正在集中力量突击制造这种收割机，即将来临的麦收中，它将显示巨大作用。
    在大大小小、各式各样的收割机群中，有部最小的收割机——涪陵镰齿式收割机，在麦田里穿梭往来。这个收割机只有一米多高，不到一米长，除了切割部件外，其余全是木结构，全身重量才三十多斤，最小的农具厂也能制造。一人牵引，一人摇把，一天可割麦八到十亩。涪陵专区各县正在普遍推广使用，全专区今年计划制造两万部。这部收割机的创造人姚成荣说得好：“任你山高路窄，也拦它不住”。姚成荣精神抖擞地推着它当众表演，为了这部收割机，他不知付出了多少心血，度过了多少不眠的夜晚。还在1958年，姚成荣到成都参观，这位当时的农业社主任看了联合收割机以后，犹如当头一棒，愁忧得几夜不能合眼。当时他想：“天天喊叫机械化，那晓得机械化竟是如此庞然大物，我们山区如何得行，只有白看着”。可是他并没有泄气，他仔细观察了联合收割机的构造原理，回去后就着手研究小型收割机。公社化后，物质条件更好了，他就专心一意的搞农业机械的研究试制工作。去年一年，他先后做出了二十多个样子的小型收割机，但都失败了。后来，党组织调来了有经验的工人和技术人员配合他研究试制，最近终于制成功了现在这样的小型收割机。来自山区和边远地区的参观者，特别喜欢这部收割机，表演刚完，姚成荣被团团围住，人们争着祝贺他这一对山区人民具有重大意义的成功创造。
    去年，就已大量推广的各种快速割禾器，今年更是花样百出：有三部的，双部的，螺旋式的，曲线的，转动的等等。表演过程中，捷报频传，凡是参加表演的收割机、割禾器，都比原来的割麦方法提高工效三倍、五倍、三十倍……。
