	The South Korean people's overthrow of Syngman Rhee is only the first step in their victory. The struggle has only just begun. A youth named Lian Dongzhu, who participated in the April 19th Seoul people's demonstration, said that the South Korean people simply could not survive under the reactionary rule. Everyone deeply hates American imperialism and the traitors. The South Korean people want to live, demand a new politics, a new society, a new life, and yearn for the reunification of their motherland. The struggle will not cease until these goals are achieved.

	Even though American imperialism and its new running dogs—the Heo Jeong group—are tightly blockading the news, we can still see from the leaked information that the South Korean people's struggle is developing and deepening, not giving the enemy a chance to breathe. The recent struggles of the people in various parts of South Korea to resist paying taxes and the collective strike of small merchants in Busan are even more significant. South Korean radio stations admit that "citizens lack an attitude of assisting the authorities," and Heo Jeong's "caretaker cabinet" is "facing a financial bankruptcy crisis." Serious economic chaos has caused Seoul's stock exchange to grind to a halt. The merchants' strike shows that the scale of the current struggle is becoming more and more magnificent. The current situation of the Heo Jeong puppet regime reminds people of the chaotic scene when Li Zongren made a show after Chiang Kai-shek was forced to step down during our War of Liberation in 1949.

	"The life of imperialism will not be long. They have done all kinds of bad things. The oppressed people all over the world will never forgive them." No matter how desperately American imperialism now supports the new puppet regime, no matter what tricks the new puppet regime plays, the running dogs raised by imperialism are always spurned by the people. How long can a regime supported by bayonets last? The angry tide of the Han River is surging ceaselessly. The more you try to suppress it, the more turbulent it becomes, until it drowns American imperialism and its running dogs.

    怒潮不息
    海明
    南朝鲜人民打垮李承晚，不过是第一步的胜利。斗争刚刚在开始。参加4月19日汉城人民示威的青年廉东柱说，南朝鲜人民在反动统治下，实在活不下去了，大家已经恨透了美帝国主义和卖国贼。南朝鲜人民要活下去，要求新的政治、新的社会、新的生活，渴望着祖国的统一。不达到这些目的，斗争是不会停息的。
    尽管美帝国主义和新走狗——许政集团怎样严密地封锁新闻，但从走漏出来的消息里，我们仍然可以看到，南朝鲜人民的斗争正在发展、深入，没有给敌人以喘息的机会。最近南朝鲜各地人民展开的抗缴捐税和釜山市小商人集体罢市的斗争，意义更为重大。南朝鲜的广播电台招认“市民们缺乏协助当局的态度”，许政的“看守内阁”“正面临着财政破产的危机”。严重的经济混乱，使汉城的证券交易已经陷于停顿了。商人罢市说明了目前斗争的规模越来越壮阔了。许政傀儡政权当前的情况，使人想起了1949年我国解放战争中，蒋介石被迫下台后的李宗仁粉墨登场时的混乱情景。
      “帝国主义的寿命不会很长了，他们做尽了坏事。全世界一切受压迫的人民决不会饶恕他们。”尽管美帝国主义现在怎样拼命支持新的傀儡政权，尽管新的傀儡政权耍什么花招，帝国主义豢养的走狗，总是人民所唾弃的。靠刺刀支持的政权，又能维持多久？汉江的怒潮正在翻滚不息，企图压抑它，它就越是汹涌澎湃，直到把美帝国主义及其走狗淹没为止。
