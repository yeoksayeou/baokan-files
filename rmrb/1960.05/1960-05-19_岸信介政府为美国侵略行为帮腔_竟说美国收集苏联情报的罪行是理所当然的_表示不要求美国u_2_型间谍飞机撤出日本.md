Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 18th: Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, in answering questions at a Diet Security Special Committee meeting today, continued to defend the U.S.'s act of aggression in conducting spy flights. He said that the summit meeting "was adjourned due to the U-2 plane issue, which is regrettable." Despite the Japanese public having long exposed the U.S. claim that U-2 planes in Japan were only conducting "meteorological observations," Kishi Nobusuke still quibbled, saying: "Regarding the mission of the U-2 planes in Japan, I basically believe the responsible U.S. response."
	He also said: "I will not demand the withdrawal of this type of aircraft from Japan."

	Kishi Nobusuke also repeated the U.S.'s robber logic yesterday, saying that in the current international situation, "collecting intelligence is a worldwide practice." He counter-accused the Soviet Union of condemning the U.S.'s U-2 spy plane aggression as "inappropriate."

	Maruyama, the Director-General of the "Procurement Agency" of the Kishi Nobusuke government, even more bluntly said: "It is only natural that the U.S. military stationed in Japan should conduct intelligence activities to protect Japan's security. It is irrelevant for Japanese people to cooperate according to labor contracts."

    岸信介政府为美国侵略行为帮腔
    竟说美国收集苏联情报的罪行是理所当然的
    表示不要求美国U—2型间谍飞机撤出日本
    新华社18日讯　东京消息：日本首相岸信介今天在国会安全特别委员会会议上答复质询时，继续为美国进行间谍飞行的侵略行为辩护。他说什么最高级会议“因为U—2型飞机问题而休会，这是令人遗憾的”。尽管日本公众早已揭穿了美国声明在日本的U—2型飞机只进行“气象观测”的骗局，但岸信介仍狡赖说：“关于在日本的U—2型飞机的任务，基本上相信美国的负责的答复。”
    他还说：“我将不要求把这种飞机撤离日本”。
    岸信介在昨天还重复美国的强盗逻辑说，在目前国际形势下，“收集情报是全世界的惯例”。他反诬苏联谴责美国U—2型间谍飞机的侵略行为是“不适宜的”。
    岸信介政府的“调达厅”长官丸山更露骨地说：“驻日美军为了保卫日本的安全，要进行情报活动，这是理所当然。日本人根据劳役合同予以协作，这是毫无关系的。”
