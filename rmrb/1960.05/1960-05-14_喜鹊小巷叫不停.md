    Spring breeze blows, hundreds of flowers are red, magpies chatter nonstop, good news spreads through streets and alleys, songs surge in Beijing. The thousand-year-old phoenix flies out of its cage, women walk out of their small homes, rivers flow into the sea and the sea grows long, the construction front gains new soldiers. New factories are built in the compounds, machines roar as soon as they start, the people who operate the machines are overjoyed. Brand new products shine with golden light. When everyone adds firewood, the flames burn high, organization brings strength, production and life improve step by step, the people's commune lasts for ten thousand years!

    喜鹊小巷叫不停春风吹、百花红，喜鹊喳喳叫不停，大街小巷传喜报，北京城里歌声涌。千年凤凰飞出笼，妇女走出小家庭，江河入海海水长，建设战线增新兵。大院盖起新工厂，机器一开隆隆响，开机器的人儿心花放。崭新的产品闪金光。众人捧柴火焰旺，组织起来力量强，生产生活步步高，人民公社万年长！
