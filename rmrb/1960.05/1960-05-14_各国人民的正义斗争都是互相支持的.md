	Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, May 12th: The Secretariat of the World Federation of Democratic Youth issued a statement on the eve of the Four-Power Summit, saying that the world's youth are engaged in heroic struggles for national independence, liberation, and peace. The statement said that Algerian youth are fighting for national independence, South Korean and Turkish youth are engaged in anti-dictatorship struggles, Cuban youth are engaged in struggles against U.S. imperialists, and youth from socialist countries such as the Soviet Union and China are working hand in hand with youth from colonial countries to defend peace. The statement pointed out that the Cold War elements have not succumbed. The U.S. reactionary group is still trying to obstruct the easing of the international situation and refusing disarmament. The militarism and revanchism of West Germany and Japan are also rampant, all of which deserve our vigilance. We must further strengthen unity so that the voices of the youth's just struggles can be heard around the world.
