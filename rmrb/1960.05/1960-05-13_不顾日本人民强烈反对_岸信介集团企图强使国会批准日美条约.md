Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 12th dispatch: The Kishi Nobusuke group, disregarding the strong opposition of the Japanese people, is making every effort to conspire to force the Diet to pass the new "Security Treaty."

According to today's "Asahi Shimbun" report, the Kishi Nobusuke government is preparing to conclude the House of Representatives' deliberations on the new "Security Treaty" around May 20th and force a vote. It is also preparing to "persuade" Ichiro Kono and Takeo Miki, leaders of the anti-mainstream faction within the Liberal Democratic Party who advocate careful deliberation of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," according to this policy.

The newspaper revealed that some members of the Liberal Democratic Party also believe that this tough policy will cause "difficult problems" within the Diet. These individuals believe that in order for Kishi Nobusuke to pass the new "Security Treaty" in the House of Representatives before the end of the Diet session on May 26th, he must overcome several hurdles: passing the new "Security Treaty" in the Diet's Special Committee on the "Security Treaty"; forcibly passing the treaty at a plenary session of the House of Representatives; and extending the Diet session. However, they believe that whether Kishi Nobusuke can overcome these hurdles is still "difficult to predict."

    不顾日本人民强烈反对
    岸信介集团企图强使国会批准日美条约
    新华社12日讯　东京消息：岸信介集团不顾日本人民的强烈反对，正在千方百计地阴谋强使国会通过新“安全条约”。
    据“朝日新闻”今天报道，岸信介政府准备在5月20日左右结束众议院关于新“安全条约”的审议，并强行表决。它并准备按照这个方针“说服”主张慎重审议新日美“安全条约”的河野一郎和三木武夫等自由民主党内反主流派首脑。
    报纸透露，对于这种强硬方针，一部分自由民主党人士也认为，这将会在国会内引起“困难问题”。这些人士认为，岸信介要在国会会期结束的5月26日以前在众议院通过新“安全条约”，必须渡过几个难关，即在国会“安全条约”特别委员会通过新“安全条约”；强行众议院全体会议通过这项条约；延长国会会期。但是，他们认为，岸信介能否冲过这几个难关还是“难以预测的”。
