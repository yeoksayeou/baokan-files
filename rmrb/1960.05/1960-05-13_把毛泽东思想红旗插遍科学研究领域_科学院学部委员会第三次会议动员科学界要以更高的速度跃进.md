Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 12th: The Third Meeting of the Academic Committee of the Chinese Academy of Sciences recently convened in Shanghai. Attending the meeting were 131 academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in the natural sciences, leading cadres, scientists, professors, and engineers from research institutions, industrial departments, and universities across the country, as well as many young scientific workers. The meeting also invited 29 outstanding worker and peasant experts from various regions to participate, including famous model workers and advanced producers in industry and agriculture such as Ma Xueli, Chen Yongkang, Su Guangming, Jiang Deyu, Wang Xuerui, Meng Qingchun, Zhan Shuijing, Chen Xingfu, Wei Zhenqing, Yang Minghan, Wang Linhe, and Li Fuxiang. The total number of attendees was over 400.

The convening of this meeting of the Academic Committee was due to the more pressing need to carry out theoretical research in the natural sciences than before. The original twelve-year long-range plan for scientific and technological development's requirements for theoretical research in the natural sciences must adapt to the new situation and supplement new content. Therefore, in order to mobilize and organize the national scientific community to better carry out theoretical research, the meeting, entrusted by the State Scientific and Technological Commission, after full discussion, drafted a three-year outline of the plan for theoretical research in natural sciences based on reviewing and summarizing the twelve-year long-range plan for scientific and technological development. It is planned to make further revisions after the meeting and then submit it to the State Scientific and Technological Commission as a suggestion.

On the first day of the meeting, Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, made a report entitled: "Hold High the Red Flag of Mao Zedong Thought and Climb to the Peak of Science Faster." Nie Rongzhen, Vice Premier of the State Council and Director of the State Scientific and Technological Commission, delivered an important speech to the conference. In their reports and speeches, they pointed out that with the accelerated leap forward in the country's socialist construction, the rapid advancement of the mass-scale technical innovation and technical revolution movement, and the new trends in science and technology in the world, China's scientific undertaking is required to leap forward at a higher speed than in the previous two years. It is necessary not only to accelerate the mastery of existing scientific and technological achievements, but also to continuously develop new creations in technology and scientific theory; all scientific workers are required to be never satisfied with existing achievements, make persistent efforts, and improve their political level and professional ability faster, respond to the call of the Party Central Committee, and unremittingly struggle to realize the twelve-year long-range plan for scientific and technological development ahead of schedule and climb to the peak of science faster. Du Runsheng, Deputy Secretary-General of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, made a report on the issue of carrying out theoretical research in the natural sciences. He pointed out that our Party and government have consistently attached importance to scientific theoretical research. He said that for theoretical research in natural sciences to leap forward, the primary issue is that it must promote correct ideology and style of study, and eliminate the ideology and style of study of the bourgeoisie; Chinese scientific workers must have a clear social purpose in conducting theoretical research in natural sciences, proceeding from the needs of socialist and communist construction, and concentrate major efforts on studying theoretical topics, marginal disciplines, and major theoretical topics with Chinese characteristics that play a leading role in the development of contemporary science. Next, he elaborated on issues such as correctly handling the relationship between theory and practice, criticism and inheritance, the mass line in theoretical work, carrying out the "Hundred Flowers Blooming" policy, and guiding scientific research with a dialectical materialist worldview and methodology.

The meeting reviewed the great leap forward and bumper harvest in the scientific cause in the two years since the Second Meeting of the Academic Committee in 1957. The representatives unanimously believed that the fundamental reason why the scientific cause, like economic construction, has also shown a momentum of one day equaling twenty years is due to the leadership of the Party; due to the implementation of the Party's general line for socialist construction in the scientific cause. Sixty-nine scientific research reports and papers were read out and presented at the meeting, including ten from young scientific workers and thirteen from worker and peasant experts. These reports and papers were rich in content, and most of them had creative insights and high levels, marking major progress in China's natural sciences, especially in theoretical research.

The meeting launched a heated discussion and debate on scientific theoretical planning and academic reports, fully displaying the spirit of "Let a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend." For different academic views, it was generally possible to express one's views freely. Some more important and critical issues were often discussed repeatedly, even in special seminars. At the meeting, worker and peasant experts exchanged experiences with scientists and veteran experts, and old experts exchanged with young experts, achieving the goal of mutual supplementation, mutual learning, and mutual promotion. The meeting was filled with a warm atmosphere of studying Mao Zedong Thought. Vice Premier Nie Rongzhen's speech and President Guo Moruo's report both demonstrated the great guiding significance and far-reaching influence of Mao Zedong Thought in promoting the high-speed leap forward of China's scientific undertaking, and pointed out that Mao Zedong Thought is not only the truth guiding our revolutionary struggle, but also the truth guiding our struggle against nature. The representatives attending the meeting expressed their confidence in their speeches that as long as the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought is planted in all fields of scientific research, persisting in putting politics in command, obeying the leadership of the Party, resolutely taking the mass line, carrying forward the spirit of large-scale collaboration, and humbly learning from the advanced science and technology of the Soviet Union and fraternal countries, China's scientific undertaking will surely continue to accelerate its leap forward, making brilliant contributions to China's socialist construction, to maintaining world peace, and to promoting the noble cause of human progress.

President Guo Moruo made a summary of the meeting. During the meeting, Vice Premier Nie Rongzhen and President Guo Moruo met with all the model workers and worker and peasant experts attending the meeting. At the opening of the conference, Chen Pixian, Cao Diqiu, and Wei Wenbo, secretaries of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, attended the meeting. The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China hosted a banquet for all the representatives attending the meeting. At the banquet, Ke Qingshi, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and First Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee, encouraged scientific workers to strive to climb to the peak of science and create scientific peaks.

    把毛泽东思想红旗插遍科学研究领域
    科学院学部委员会第三次会议动员科学界要以更高的速度跃进
    据新华社上海12日电　中国科学院学部委员会第三次会议最近在上海举行。出席会议的有中国科学院自然科学方面的一百三十一位学部委员，有各地研究机关、产业部门和高等学校的领导干部、科学家、教授、工程师，还有许多青年科学工作者。会议并且邀请了各地有卓越成就的工农专家二十九人参加，他们中间有马学礼、陈永康，苏广铭、姜德玉、王学锐、孟庆春、詹水晶、陈兴富、魏镇卿、杨明汉、王林鹤、李福祥等著名工农业劳动模范和先进生产者。全部出席人数共有四百多人。
    这次学部委员会会议的召开，是由于开展自然科学理论研究比以前更为迫切需要，原定的十二年科学技术发展远景规划对于自然科学理论研究的要求，必须适应新的形势，补充新的内容。因此，为了动员和组织全国科学界更好地开展理论研究，会议接受国家科学技术委员会的委托，经过充分讨论，在检查与总结十二年科学技术发展远景规划的基础上，起草了今后自然科学理论研究的三年规划纲要草案。准备在会后再作进一步的修订，然后作为建议提交国家科学技术委员会。
    会议的第一天，中国科学院院长郭沫若作了题为：“高举毛泽东思想红旗，更快地攀登科学高峰”的报告。国务院副总理兼国家科学技术委员会主任聂荣臻向大会作了重要讲话。他们在报告和讲话中指出，随着国家的社会主义建设事业进程的加速跃进，随着全民规模的技术革新、技术革命运动的突飞猛进，随着世界上科学技术的新趋势，要求我国科学事业以比前两年更高的速度跃进，不仅要加快掌握现有的科学技术成就，而且要在技术和科学理论方面不断发展新的创造；要求全体科学工作者，丝毫不满足于已有的成就，再接再厉，更快地提高政治水平和业务能力，响应党中央的号召，为提前实现十二年科学技术发展远景规划、更快攀登科学高峰而坚持不懈地进行奋斗。中国科学院副秘书长杜润生就开展自然科学理论研究问题作了报告。他指出，我们党和政府对科学理论研究是一贯重视的。他说，自然科学理论研究要跃进，首要的问题是必须发扬正确的思想、学风，破除资产阶级的思想、学风；我国科学工作者进行自然科学理论研究，必须具有明确的社会目的性，从社会主义、共产主义建设需要出发，集中主要的力量研究当代科学发展中起带头作用的理论课题、边缘学科和具有我国特色的重大理论课题。接着他对于正确对待理论联系实际、批判和继承、理论工作走群众路线、开展百家争鸣和以辩证唯物主义世界观和方法论指导科学研究等问题作了阐述。
    会议回顾了自从1957年学部委员会第二次会议以后两年多来科学事业的大跃进和大丰收。与会代表们一致认为，在科学事业中所以和经济建设一样也呈现出一天等于二十年的气势，根本原因是由于党的领导；由于在科学事业中贯彻执行了党的社会主义建设总路线。会上宣读和提出了六十九篇科学研究报告和论文，其中青年科学工作者提出的有十篇，工农专家提出的有十三篇。这些报告和论文，内容丰富多彩，极大部分都有创造性的见解，具有较高的水平，标志着我国在自然科学，特别是理论研究方面的重大进展。
    会议对科学理论规划和学术报告等展开了热烈的讨论和争辩，充分发挥了百家争鸣的精神。对于学术上不同的见解，基本上做到了各抒所见，畅所欲言。有些比较重要的关键性的问题，往往反复讨论好几次，甚至进行专题座谈。会上，工农专家同科学家、老专家同青年专家都互相交流了经验，达到了互相补充、互相学习、互相促进的目的。会议洋溢着学习毛泽东思想的热烈气氛。聂荣臻副总理的讲话和郭沫若院长的报告都论证了毛泽东思想对于促进我国科学事业高速度跃进的伟大指导意义和深远的影响，并指出，毛泽东思想是指导我们进行革命斗争的真理，又是指导我们向自然作斗争的真理。出席会议的代表在发言中充满信心地认为，只要把毛泽东思想的红旗插在所有的科学研究领域，坚持政治挂帅，服从党的领导，坚决走群众路线，发扬大协作精神，虚心学习苏联和兄弟国家的先进科学技术，我国的科学事业一定能不断地加速跃进，为我国社会主义建设、为维护世界和平和促进人类进步的崇高事业作出辉煌的贡献。
    会议由郭沫若院长作了总结。会议期间，聂荣臻副总理和郭沫若院长曾接见了出席会议的全体劳动模范和工农专家。在大会开幕时，中共上海市委书记处书记陈丕显、曹荻秋、魏文伯等都出席了会议。中共上海市委又宴请全体出席会议的代表。在宴会上，中共中央政治局委员、上海市委第一书记柯庆施在讲话中勉励科学工作者努力攀登科学高峰，创造科学高峰。
