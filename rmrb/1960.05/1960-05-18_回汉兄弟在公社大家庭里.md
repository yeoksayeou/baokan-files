In the sewing factory, clothing factory, and knitting and embroidery factory of the Qingzhen Lane People's Commune in Xining City, Qinghai Province, one can see Hui and Han men and women workers laboring side by side in the same workshop, teaching each other various skills, and caring for each other like members of the same family, jointly building a happy and fulfilling life.

	Teaching Apprentices
In the shoe factory of the commune, more than a hundred female workers are busily making cloth shoes, skillfully lasting, soling, and stitching. Someone who doesn't know the situation would surely think they are all veteran shoemakers. In fact, not long ago they were still housewives. The rapid improvement of these workers' shoemaking skills is inseparable from the Hui shoemaker Tan Guoying's enthusiasm for teaching apprentices. Before the establishment of the Qingzhen Lane People's Commune, he had been repairing and patching shoes for people sporadically on the streets, and his skills were quite proficient. After the establishment of the commune, he came to the shoe factory. At the beginning, the shoe factory had only dozens of workers, all housewives, who didn't know how to make shoes. At that time, the shoe factory's Party branch, in order to quickly improve the technical level of all workers, proposed the slogan "Guarantee teaching and learning, the master leads the apprentice." Tan Guoying actively responded to the Party's call, trying every means to teach new workers to master shoemaking skills. A Han female worker named Wu Guizhen, when she first entered the factory, would pick up the awl and drop the needle, and pick up the needle and drop the awl. Tan Guoying would sit down and personally demonstrate, letting Wu Guizhen watch carefully from the side. After a week, Wu Guizhen learned the shoemaking skills. In the past, it took her two days to sole a pair of shoes, now she can sole more than three pairs a day.

When Tan Guoying teaches new workers shoemaking, he always asks everyone to be quick with their eyes, diligent with their hands, and concentrate on listening. Every week, he gives a lecture to more than 180 workers in the soling, lasting, and cutting and gluing workshops. With his patient help, now more than 90% of the Hui and Han workers in the factory have become skilled workers from novices, and they can produce more than two hundred pairs of cloth shoes every day to meet market needs.

	Close as a Family
Originally, five Hui families and one Han family lived in compound number 27 of Qingzhen Lane. The Han person was named Li Yaoting, and he worked as a doctor in the traditional Chinese medicine clinic. Sometimes, when he came back from work, he would find that the water bottles in his house had already been filled with water, and there were also vegetables. Upon inquiring, he learned that these were all done for him by the Hui old grandmother Ma Yingquan, who lived in the same courtyard. The Hui men and women of this courtyard worked at the commune's ore factory or made clothes in the sewing factory. During the day, only the elderly and children were left, and everything in the courtyard was taken care of by the elderly. Those who worked outside didn't have to worry about the children's eating, drinking, and sleeping. Li Yaoting also often treated the Hui children, and sometimes when he returned home from the clinic, he would buy medicine and bring it back, and also boil and feed the medicine to the children.

People in this courtyard don't lock their doors when they go to work or go out, and nothing has ever been lost. Although five Hui families and one Han family live there, they have never quarreled, as if they were living in one family. Just as the traditional Chinese medicine doctor Li Yaoting said, "When I go to work, I don't have to worry about housework!"

The sanitation in this courtyard is very good. It is swept clean everywhere, without a bit of garbage; the rooms are bright and clean, spotless, giving people a refreshing feeling.

	Mutual New Year Greetings
People know that the Hui have their own festivals, but they don't celebrate the Han New Year; the Han also have their own festivals, but they don't celebrate the Hui's Eid al-Adha. But after communization, a new phenomenon of Hui and Han people exchanging New Year greetings has appeared in Qingzhen Lane.

The commune's clothing factory has a total of 218 workers. Apart from 27 Han workers, the rest are all Hui. The female factory director Luo Xiuying is also Hui. Last Spring Festival, Factory Director Luo and Hui workers Gu Yufang, Ma Xianglan, and others bought gifts such as tea, biscuits, soap, and socks and went to the home of Han worker Lin Famei to pay a New Year's visit.

Among the Hui people in Qingzhen Lane, there is often such an intimate saying: more than 80% of Qingzhen Lane are Hui, and the Hui must take care of the Han in all aspects.

Last March, Lin Famei caught a cold and was lying at home, unable to go to work at the clothing factory. The Hui factory director and workshop director took turns visiting her, asking about her health and well-being.

    回汉兄弟在公社大家庭里
    高庆琪
    在青海省西宁市清真巷人民公社的缝纫厂、被服厂、针织刺绣厂里，人们可以看到回族和汉族的男女工人们，在一个车间里并肩劳动、互相传授各种技术，彼此关心得像一家人一样，共同建设着美满幸福的生活。
                     教徒弟
    在公社制鞋厂的车间里，一百多个女工人正在忙碌地制作布鞋，并熟练地绱鞋、纳底、扎口。不了解情况的人，一定以为她们都是老制鞋工人。其实，不久前她们还是家庭妇女呢。这些工人制鞋技术的迅速提高，和回族制鞋工人谭国英热情地教徒弟是分不开的。他在清真巷人民公社成立前，一直在街道上零星给人家修鞋、补鞋，技术相当熟练。公社成立后，他就来到鞋厂。刚开始时，鞋厂只有几十个工人，都是家庭妇女，都不会制鞋，当时，鞋厂党支部为了使全厂工人技术水平很快提高，提出了“包教保学，师傅带徒弟”的号召。谭国英积极响应党的号召，想尽一切办法教新工人掌握制鞋技术。一个名叫吴桂珍的汉族女工，刚进厂时，拿起锥子丢了针，拿起针又丢了锥子，谭国英就坐下来亲自操作，让吴桂珍在一旁细心看，一个星期后，吴桂珍就学会了制鞋技术。过去她两天才能纳一双鞋，现在一天就能纳三双多。
    谭国英在教新工人制鞋时，总是要求大家要眼快，手勤，专心听讲。每个星期他都要分别给纳底、绱鞋、切粘三个车间的一百八十多工人讲一次课。在他的耐心帮助下，现在，全厂的回、汉族工人已有90％以上的人都从生手变成了熟手，每天可生产二百多双布鞋，供应市场需要。
                      亲如一家人
    原来清真巷二十七号院内居住着五户回族和一户汉族。汉族人名叫李耀亭，在中医门诊部当医生。有时，当他下班回来，就发现屋子里的水瓶已经灌满了水，还放有蔬菜。一打听，才知道这都是同院的回族老奶奶马应全替他办的。这个院子里的回族男女青壮年有的在公社矿石厂工作，有的在缝纫厂做工，一到白天，就剩下老人和小孩，院子里的一切事情都由老年人担负起来，小孩子吃饭、喝水、睡觉用不着在外工作的人担心。李耀亭还经常给回族小孩看病，有时从门诊部回家时把药给买了带回来，还给小孩熬药、喂药。
    这个院子里的人上班或上街时，都不锁门，从来没有发现丢失过什么东西。虽然居住着五户回族和一户汉族，但从未吵过架，就好像是生活在一个家庭里一样。正如同那位中医李耀亭所说的：“我上班时，就没有为家务事操过心！”
    这个院子里的卫生做得很好，到处打扫得干干净净，没有一点垃圾；室内明窗净几，一尘不染，给人一种清新的感觉。
                    互相拜年
    人们都知道，回族有自己的节日，不过汉族的年节；汉族也有自己的节日，不过回族的尔德节。但在公社化后的清真巷，却出现了回族和汉族互相拜年的新气象。
    公社被服厂共有二百一十八个工人，除了二十七个汉族工人外，剩下的都是回族。女厂长罗秀英也是回族。去年春节时，罗厂长和回族工人古玉芳、马香兰等人，买了茶叶、饼干、肥皂、袜子等礼物，到汉族工人林发梅的家里去拜年。
    在清真巷里的回族人民中经常有这样一种亲切的说法：清真巷内80％以上都是回族，回族要从各方面照顾汉族。
    去年3月，林发梅得了感冒，躺在家里，不能到被服厂上工。回族厂长、车间主任轮流去看望她，问寒问暖。
