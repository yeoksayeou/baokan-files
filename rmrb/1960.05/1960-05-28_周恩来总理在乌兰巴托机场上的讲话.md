Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, May 27th: The full text of Premier Zhou Enlai's speech at Ulaanbaatar Airport is as follows:

	Dear Comrade Tsedenbal, dear comrades and friends:

	After visiting Burma, India, Nepal, Cambodia, and the southernmost country in our socialist family—the Democratic Republic of Vietnam—Comrade Chen Yi and I are very pleased to have the opportunity to make a friendly visit to our brotherly neighbor to the north, the Mongolian People's Republic. On behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, I would like to extend my highest respect and warmest greetings to the Mongolian government and the Mongolian people.

	I visited your country in 1954. Although that visit was short, the enthusiasm shown by the hardworking and simple Mongolian people in building their motherland left a deep impression on me. Since that time, our two countries have made encouraging achievements in socialist construction, our friendly mutual assistance and cooperation have made great progress, and the entire international situation has undergone tremendous changes that are further favorable to socialism, the national independence movement, and world peace. This is something to rejoice about for the people of our two countries.

	The lifespan of imperialism headed by the United States will not be long. Precisely because of this, they are carrying out a frantic struggle. Recently, U.S. imperialism, defying world opinion, carried out aggression and provocation against our great neighbor, the Soviet Union, and undermined the four-power summit conference, which was eagerly anticipated by the world. This perverse act by U.S. imperialism cannot save it from its inevitable decline. The people of our two brotherly countries, China and Mongolia, firmly support the solemn measures taken by the Soviet government against the provocative crimes of U.S. imperialism. We will continue to unite closely with the great Soviet people, the people of all socialist countries, and all peace-loving people to make unremitting efforts against the aggression and provocation of U.S. imperialism and to strive for the easing of international tensions and lasting world peace.

	Comrades, friends, please allow me, on behalf of Comrade Chen Yi and myself, to thank you for such a warm and grand welcome. I hope that our visit will contribute to further strengthening the friendly relations between our two countries and enhancing our close cooperation in international affairs.

	Long live the Mongolian People's republic!

	Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Mongolian people!

	Long live the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

    周恩来总理在乌兰巴托机场上的讲话
    新华社乌兰巴托27日电　周恩来总理在乌兰巴托机场的讲话，全文如下：亲爱的泽登巴尔主席同志，亲爱的同志们和朋友们：
    我和陈毅同志在访问了缅甸、印度、尼泊尔、柬埔寨和我们社会主义大家庭最南方的国家——越南民主共和国之后，能够有机会来到我国北方的兄弟邻邦——蒙古人民共和国进行友好访问，感到十分高兴。我谨以中国政府和中国人民的名义，向蒙古政府和蒙古人民致以最崇高的敬意和最亲切的问候。
    1954年我曾经访问过你们的国家，那一次的访问虽然时间很短，但是，勤劳纯朴的蒙古人民为建设自己祖国所表现的热情给我留下了深刻的印象。自从那个时候以来，我们两国的社会主义建设事业都取得了令人鼓舞的成就，我们两国的友好互助合作关系有了很大的进展，整个国际形势也发生了进一步有利于社会主义、民族独立运动和世界和平的巨大变化。这是值得我们两国人民欢欣鼓舞的。
    以美国为首的帝国主义的寿命不会很长了。正因为这样，他们进行着疯狂的挣扎。最近，美帝国主义冒天下之大不韪，对我们伟大邻邦苏联进行了侵略和挑衅，破坏了举世渴望的四国政府首脑会议。美帝国主义这种倒行逆施，决不能挽救它必然没落的命运。我们中蒙两个兄弟国家的人民都坚决支持苏联政府对美帝国主义的挑衅罪行所采取的严正措施。我们将继续同伟大的苏联人民、所有社会主义国家的人民和一切爱好和平的人民紧密团结起来，为反对美帝国主义的侵略和挑衅，为争取国际紧张局势的和缓和世界持久和平作出坚持不懈的努力。
    同志们，朋友们，请允许我以陈毅同志和我个人的名义，感谢你们这样热烈、盛大的欢迎。我希望我们这次的访问，能够对于进一步加强我们两国的友好关系，加强我们两国在国际事务中的亲密合作作出贡献。
    蒙古人民共和国万岁！
    中蒙两国人民牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大团结万岁！
