Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch from Istanbul: News from Istanbul: On April 30th, another large-scale demonstration of five thousand students against the reactionary rule of Menderes erupted in Istanbul, Turkey's largest city. Simultaneously, students in Ankara, the capital of Turkey, continued to hold marches. According to Western news agencies, the situation in Adana, an important military base in southern Turkey, was also "somewhat turbulent."

In Istanbul, yesterday, approximately three thousand students initially demonstrated near Istanbul University, surrounded by the military. They then marched towards the city hall, where NATO was scheduled to hold a meeting on May 2nd, chanting slogans such as "Freedom!" When they reached a mosque, the number of demonstrators reached five thousand. After breaking through the army cordon with bayonets on Vatan Street, they rushed into the garden of a hospital, where many students injured by police beatings in the previous two days were being treated.

The Menderes government mobilized thousands of troops to stand shoulder to shoulder in front of the city hall, with a tank parked at each entrance. Helicopters flew low in the sky as a show of force. The reactionary authorities also dispatched troops in ten trucks to suppress the five thousand students demonstrating at the hospital, surrounding the facility.

In Ankara, students from the Gazi Education and Technical School, led by female students, marched out yesterday morning. Military police suppressed them about twenty meters outside the school, preventing them from taking to the streets.

Meanwhile, the Menderes government intensified its suppression, announcing that the curfew would be extended from April 30th, from the originally announced 11:00 PM to 4:00 AM, to starting at 7:00 PM.

Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch from Istanbul: News from Istanbul: Following the large-scale demonstration by thousands of students in Istanbul, Turkey, on April 30th against the dictatorial regime of Menderes, the military commander of Istanbul announced on the 1st that any demonstration would be dealt with by force. He stated that the army had been ordered to open fire on even the smallest gatherings. The military commander also announced a 24-hour curfew in the city, prohibiting any public gatherings, and ordering all public places, including bars, restaurants, stadiums, and churches, to be closed or prohibited from opening.

The situation in this major city in western Turkey is tense. All major streets are lined with heavily armed troops, and tanks and heavy forces guard strategic locations. On the same day, Turkish Prime Minister Menderes, in a nationwide radio address, urged parents to "restrain the behavior of their children in school," attempting to obstruct the students' struggle against the dictatorial regime by this means.

    新华社1日讯　伊斯坦布尔消息：土耳其最大城市伊斯坦布尔在4月30日又爆发了五千名学生反对曼德列斯反动统治的大示威。同时，土耳其首都安卡拉的学生也继续举行了游行。据西方通讯社报道，土耳其南部重要军事基地亚达那的局势也“有一些不平静”。
    在伊斯坦布尔，昨天首先约有三千名学生在被军队包围的伊斯坦布尔大学附近示威。他们接着走到北大西洋公约组织预定5月2日在那里开会的市政厅前面示威，他们高呼“自由！”等口号。他们走到一个清真寺前面时，示威人数达到五千人。他们在范丹大街冲破拿着刺刀的军队警戒线之后，冲进一所医院的花园，在这所医院中有许多前两天被警察殴打受伤的学生。
    曼德列斯政府出动了数千名军队并肩站在市政厅前面，市政厅的每一个门口都停着一辆坦克，直升飞机在天空低飞威吓。反动当局还出动了由十辆卡车载运的军队去镇压在医院示威的五千名学生，他们包围了这个医院。
    在安卡拉，昨天上午加齐教育和技术学校的学生们，由女学生领先出去游行。军警在校外约二十米处就进行镇压，阻止这些学生上街。
    同时，曼德列斯政府加紧镇压，宣布从4月30日晚上起，宵禁时间延长，从原来宣布的晚上十一时至次晨四时，改为从晚上七时起始。
    新华社1日讯　伊斯坦布尔消息：在土耳其伊斯坦布尔数千名学生4月30日举行反对曼德列斯独裁政权的大示威后，伊斯坦布尔的军事长官1日宣布，将以武力对付任何示威。他说，已经命令军队对甚至是最小的集会开枪。军事长官还宣布在这个城市实行一天二十四小时的戒严，禁止任何公共集会，所有公共场所包括酒吧间、饭馆、体育场和教堂都禁止营业或开放。
    土耳其西部的这座大城市局势紧张。各主要街道上都布置着荷枪实弹的军队，在各战略据点有坦克和重兵守卫。同一天，土耳其总理曼德列斯在向全国发表广播谈话中，要家长们“约束在学子弟的行为”，企图用这种手段来阻挠学生们反对独裁政权的斗争。
