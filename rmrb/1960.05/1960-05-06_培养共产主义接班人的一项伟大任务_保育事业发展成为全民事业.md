A Great Task of Cultivating Communist Successors
Childcare Develops into a Cause for All the People

    (Reported by our newspaper) With the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in our country, millions of women have stepped out of their homes and onto the production front and other work posts. In this new situation, nurseries, kindergartens, and other organizations in rural areas, factories, mines, and cities have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. According to statistics at the end of 1959, there were more than 3.6 million nurseries and kindergartens in rural areas across the country. According to surveys in Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, Sichuan, Guizhou, Jiangxi, and other provinces, the number of children enrolled accounted for about 60% to 80% of the total number of children of the appropriate age. In the first half of 1959, nurseries and breastfeeding rooms in factories and mines across the country had developed to more than 28,000, with more than one million children enrolled, an increase of more than threefold compared with 1957. According to preliminary statistics, people's communes and street organizations in major and medium-sized cities have established more than 42,000 childcare organizations, with more than 1.2 million children enrolled.

    The thousands of childcare organizations that have developed during the Great Leap Forward have adopted flexible and diverse methods to adapt to the needs of production and the masses. Nurseries mainly for infants are located near workshops and fields to facilitate breastfeeding by mothers; kindergartens mainly for young children are located in dormitories to facilitate pick-up and drop-off by mothers, so that children are accepted as soon as they arrive. In rural areas, some childcare organizations concentrate children during busy farming seasons and allow them to return home during slack seasons.

    The large-scale development and adoption of various forms of these childcare organizations have effectively ensured that mothers can work in production, study culture, and engage in technological innovation with peace of mind. Many mothers enthusiastically praise, "Nurseries are really good, the children's problem is solved, from now on there is no worry in our hearts, we will work hard in production to thank the Party." Thanks to the hard work of childcare workers and the guidance of health and hygiene institutions, the children are generally growing up healthy. Now, nurseries and kindergartens in general cities can achieve early prevention and early treatment, and have better controlled the prevalence of infectious diseases. In Lishui County, Zhejiang Province, 942 nurseries and 371 kindergartens have generally established relatively sound health systems, so that more than 25,000 children have not had a single case of infectious disease in the past six months. In the central district of Chongqing, 95% of kindergartens and nurseries have basically achieved disease-free status.

    The vast number of childcare workers love the childcare cause, and they regard educating the next generation as a noble communist labor. Some said, "Not for fame, not for profit, but wholeheartedly for communism." Their slogans are: "Aunties are better than mothers," and "Children are like our own, the nursery and kindergarten are better than home." They do not dislike dirt, are not afraid of tiredness, are not afraid of difficulties, and do not care about remuneration, giving convenience to mothers, giving joy to children, and leaving difficulties to themselves. In order to prevent diseases, some go to the mountains to collect herbs and diligently study knowledge of disease prevention; in order to care for sick children, they sometimes stay up all night, and some even donate blood for seriously ill children. A large number of advanced units and advanced workers in childcare work have emerged throughout the country.

    The Party attaches great importance to the development of childcare organizations and gives unlimited care to the healthy growth of children. Over the past year or so, Party committees and women's federations at all levels have adopted various methods to train childcare workers at all levels, greatly improving their ideological awareness and working ability. According to statistics at the end of 1959, about 50% of childcare workers across the country have undergone a certain period of training, and some places have reached 75%. Some provinces and cities have also set up childcare nurse schools and nurse classes.

    培养共产主义接班人的一项伟大任务
    保育事业发展成为全民事业
    本报讯　随着我国工农业生产的大跃进，千百万妇女从家庭中走上生产战线和其他工作岗位的新形势，我国农村、厂矿和城市的托儿所、幼儿园等组织也像雨后春笋般的涌现出来。据1959年年底统计，全国农村共有托儿所、幼儿园三百六十多万个，入托儿童据山西、河北、山东、四川、贵州、江西等省调查，约占适龄儿童总数的60％到80％。1959年上半年，全国厂矿企业托儿所、哺乳室已发展到二万八千多个，入托孩子一百多万名，比1957年增加了三倍多。根据初步统计：各大中城市的人民公社和街道组织，已办托儿组织四万二千多个，入托儿童一百二十多万名。
    在大跃进中发展起来的成千上万的托儿组织，采取灵活多样的方式，适应生产和群众的需要。以乳儿为主的托儿所设在车间、田头附近，便利母亲喂奶；以幼儿为主的幼儿园设在宿舍，便利母亲接送，做到随到随收。在农村，有的托儿组织在农忙时把孩子集中，农闲时让孩子分散回家。
    这些托儿组织的大量发展和采取各种形式，有力地保证了母亲们能够安心地生产、学习文化、搞技术革新。许多妈妈热烈地赞扬说：“托儿所真是好，娃娃问题解决了，从此心头无挂牵，努力生产感谢党。”由于保育人员的辛勤劳动和卫生保健机构的指导，孩子们大都长得很健康。现在一般城市托儿所、幼儿园都能做到早期预防，早期治疗，较好地控制了传染病的流行。浙江省丽水县九百四十二个托儿所，三百七十一个幼儿园普遍制定了比较健全的卫生制度，使二万五千多个孩子在过去的半年内没有发生一例传染病。重庆市中区95％的园所基本上实现了无病园所。
    广大的保教人员热爱保育事业，她们把教养下一代看成是共产主义的崇高的劳动。有的说：“不为名来不为利，一心要为共产主义。”她们的口号是：“阿姨赛妈妈”，“孩子如亲生，所园胜如家”。她们不嫌脏、不怕累、不怕困难、不计报酬，把方便送给妈妈，把愉快送给孩子，把困难留给自己。为预防疾病，有的上山采药，刻苦学习预防疾病的知识；为护理生病的孩子，她们有时日夜不眠，有的还为重病的孩子输血。全国各地出现了大批保育工作的先进单位和先进工作者。
    党对托儿组织的发展极为重视，对儿童们的健康成长给予无限的关怀。一年多来，经过各级党委和妇联组织采取多种多样的办法，层层训练保教人员，使保教人员的思想觉悟和工作能力大大提高。据1959年底统计，全国保育人员经过一定时间训练的大约有50％，有的地方已经达到75％，有的省市还举办了保育护士学校、护士班。
