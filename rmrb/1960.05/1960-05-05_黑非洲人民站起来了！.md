    The Black African People Have Risen!
    Jin Zhonghua
    The Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference held in Conakry had a distinct characteristic: the vast majority of African countries, both independent and those striving for independence, had representatives participating. Of the seventy-plus countries and regional entities participating in the conference, two-thirds were from Africa. This is a great development compared to the 1955 Bandung Conference, and a significant step forward compared to the 1958 Cairo Conference. The African people, holding high the banner of anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism, have become an exceptionally prominent symbol of the new world situation in 1960.
    Conakry is the capital of Guinea, a Black African country. This place on the West African coast, which used to be little noticed, has now become an important international city due to the emergence of the independent Republic of Guinea. It welcomes representatives from dozens of Asian and African countries with a newborn air of freedom. When we got off the plane, the first moving scene was two rows of neatly uniformed teenagers and a group of healthy and lively girls holding flowers, welcoming guests from afar. They applauded warmly, guided the guests to the airport lounge, and brought cold fruit juice. To the beat of ethnic musical instruments, some danced spontaneously. The unrestrained, free, and lively atmosphere made people feel that the entire Black Africa was breaking through centuries of darkness and enslavement, moving towards freedom and light.
    It is particularly significant that this Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference was held in Guinea, a newly independent Black African country. Everyone saw that in Conakry, many buildings in the scenic peninsula area, where the former French colonial rulers were entrenched, have become the seat of government for this newly built republic. The Democratic Party conference hall, located on a tree-lined avenue, became the venue for the historically significant Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference. Enthusiastic and active young Guinean men and women and other staff spent only two days and nights decorating the entire venue. Here, facing two rows of huge slogans reading "Strengthen Asian-African Solidarity and Completely Eradicate Imperialism and Colonialism" and "Oppose Cultural Aggression, Racial Discrimination, and Economic Plunder," the representatives of the people of Asian and African countries issued a strong call to resolutely oppose imperialism and colonialism and to strive for and maintain national independence.
    As the chairman of the conference, the head of the Guinean delegation, Ismael Touré, said, "Perhaps, in the history of our common struggle, there has never been a meeting as timely and influential as this one held in this previously little-known part of the African continent." He pointed out: "In the past two years, the colonial system has been collapsing at an extraordinary rate: Guinea and Cameroon have become independent, and Togo, Somaliland, Nigeria, Congo, Mali, and Madagascar will soon follow. ... The chains are long, but we firmly believe that even the most optimistic timetable will be exceeded, and this huge movement will continue to expand."
    This strong belief is precisely the common belief of the people of Asian and African countries, especially the various ethnic groups in Africa. At the conference, we heard speeches from representatives of the deeply troubled Black African countries: from Senegal, French Sudan, Dahomey, Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Congo, Ruanda-Urundi, as well as Portuguese Angola and South West Africa under the rule of racists in the Union of South Africa. In impassioned tones, they accused the colonialists of endless crimes, denounced the various conspiracies of the imperialists, and exposed the shameless deception of neo-colonialists in playing the tricks of fake "independence" and fake "aid." They resolutely demanded immediate independence and were determined to use struggle to completely end the aggression and enslavement of imperialists and colonialists. They warmly sympathized with and supported the Algerian national liberation war, considering it "a symbol of the Asian and African people's selfless struggle for freedom and liberation." In his speech, Um Nyobe, President of the Union of the Peoples of Cameroon, angrily condemned the French imperialists for their armed suppression of the Cameroonian people's struggle for independence and freedom, as well as the collusion between the US and French imperialists. He firmly stated that the Cameroonian people would carry out armed struggle to the end and would establish a provisional revolutionary government.
    The people of Africa not only demand political independence but also believe that true economic independence is necessary to achieve complete political independence. Taking Black Africa as an example, its land is very fertile, and its people are diligent, simple, and brave. The so-called ignorance and backwardness are entirely the painful results of the brutal enslavement and plunder by Western "civilized" robbers for hundreds of years. Everyone knows that on the West African coast, there used to be large-scale "trade" in hunting black people as slaves. Those white "civilized people" treated the captured black people as living "goods" and transported them to the Americas for sale. According to various statistics, for every one black slave who survived to be sold, five had died in the process of being captured and transported. Over hundreds of years, at least tens of millions of people were transported to the Americas. At the same time, Western colonial monopoly companies enclosed large areas of land in Africa, forced black people to engage in forced labor, purchased black people's agricultural products at the lowest prices, transported them to Europe to obtain huge profits, and at the same time sold low-quality consumer goods to black people at high prices, squeezing out every bit of their meager income.
    We can see the economic situation in West Africa from Guinea. Here, the coastal areas are crisscrossed by rivers, with abundant rainfall, lush forests, and rich mineral deposits. Conakry has an annual rainfall of four meters, and there are tall and dense mango trees, palm trees, and coconut groves everywhere. The soil here is vermilion, with iron ore containing more than 60% iron, as well as abundant aluminum ore. The people of Guinea originally grew rice as food; but since the arrival of the French colonists, they were forced to grow bananas, so that the colonists could monopolize the price of this single export product and carry out brutal exploitation and plunder. Many Black African countries have been forced by French colonists to switch to growing single cash crops: Senegal grows peanuts, French Sudan grows cotton, Dahomey grows oil palms, and the Ivory Coast grows cocoa and coffee. In addition to such economic plunder, the colonial rulers also forced people to perform "compulsory labor" – in fact, they used arms to drive black people to perform uncompensated slave labor hundreds of miles away. The ports, highways, railways, and other modern facilities in Africa were all built by these so-called "civilized" white people with the blood, sweat, and bones of black people. After this conference, we traveled and visited a city sixty miles from Conakry. As our car sped forward on the wide highway, I could not help but think of what the French journalist Albert Londres, who had traveled in Africa thirty years ago, wrote in his book "Dark Africa." In a tone of repentance, he told the French people: These roads should be covered with flowers, because "only in this way can we mourn every black person who has dedicated himself to civilization on every sleeper!"
    The African people will not forget these blood-stained histories in their struggle for independence and freedom. On the closing day of this conference, we saw a performance by the Guinean National Dance Troupe at the presidential palace reception, which included several programs that used ethnic dances to perform politically charged content. One depicted a French colonial policeman deliberately planting evidence during a body search, killing a black man with a gun, raping his wife, and robbing his property. Another described the brutal conditions of forced labor: the overseer, like a hunting dog, brutally beat some exhausted black people with whips, causing them to roll all over the ground until they died; finally, the black people rose up in resistance, seized the whips, beat the overseer to death, and were all liberated. These plots were already a thing of the past in independent Guinea, but they were still a vivid reality in most Black African countries.
    We saw that the representatives from Asian and African countries, especially Africa, expressed the same anger and excitement along with the plot and the intense dance movements. When they saw another program showing the Guinean people celebrating the harvest after independence, especially when the fruits of their labor belonged to them, how excited and envious they were. This emotional excitement was even more fully expressed at the mass rally the day after the conference closed, when everyone saw thousands of Guinean women and children, dressed in colorful new clothes, singing and dancing in the streets. Some representatives said that people in African countries that have not yet achieved independence do not know how much courage to fight will be increased when they see this scene of freedom and joy!
    The achievements of this Conakry conference are very great. It marks a new stage in the Asian and African people's struggle together, holding high the banner of anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism. We are particularly pleased that the people of Black Africa have stood up and are bursting out with infinite power to sweep away the humiliation and darkness imposed on them by imperialists and colonialists for hundreds of years. We firmly believe that they will all see the light again and achieve victory. This is the trend of history, and no force can stop it.

    黑非洲人民站起来了！
    金仲华
    在科纳克里举行的第二届亚非人民团结大会，有一个鲜明的特色，就是极大多数的非洲国家，包括已独立和正在争取独立的，都有代表参加。参加大会的七十多个国家和地区单位中，有三分之二是属于非洲的。这比之1955年的万隆会议，是一个大发展；比之1958年的开罗会议，也是大大前进了一步。非洲人民高高擎起反帝反殖民主义的旗帜，成了1960年世界新形势中一个异常突出的标志。
    科纳克里是黑非洲国家几内亚的首都。这个位在西非海岸、过去不大受人注意的地方，现在由于独立的几内亚共和国的出现，而成了一个重要的国际城市。它用一种新生的自由的空气，迎接着来自亚非几十个国家的代表们。当我们从飞机上下来时，第一个动人的景象，就是两排穿着整齐制服的少年们和一群手拿鲜花、健康活泼的少女们，欢迎着远道而来的客人。他们热烈地鼓掌，引导客人到机场休息室，端来冷饮的果子水；在民族乐器的击拍声中，有的自然地舞蹈起来。那种无拘无束、自由活泼的气氛，使人感觉得整个黑非洲正在冲破几百年来的黑暗和奴役，走向自由和光明。
    这次亚非人民团结大会在新独立的黑非洲国家几内亚举行，是特别有意义的。大家看到，在科纳克里，原来法国殖民统治者盘踞着的风景优美的半岛部分，许多大厦已成为这个新建共和国的政府所在地。位在一条林荫大道上的民主党会议厅，成了具有历史意义的第二届亚非人民团结大会的会场。热情而积极的几内亚青年男女和其他工作人员，用短短两昼夜时间，把整个会场布置打扮起来。在这里，面对着两排“加强亚非团结，彻底铲除帝国主义和殖民主义”、“反对文化侵略、种族歧视和经济掠夺”的巨幅标语，亚非各国人民的代表发出了坚决反对帝国主义和殖民主义、争取和维护民族独立的强大呼声。
    正如大会主席、几内亚代表团团长伊斯梅尔·杜尔所说的，“也许，在我们共同斗争的历史中，未曾有过一个会议，像这次在非洲大陆这个向来不大为人所知的部分举行的会议那样合乎时机和具有重大影响了。”他指出：“两年来，殖民制度正在以一种非常的速度崩溃下去：几内亚和喀麦隆独立了，很快还将有多哥、索马里兰、尼日利亚、刚果、马里和马达加斯加。……链索是长的，然而我们坚信，即使最乐观的日程表，也将被超过，而这个巨大的运动还将继续扩展下去。”
    这种坚强的信念，也正是亚非各国，特别是非洲各族人民的共同信念。在大会上，我们听到灾难深重的黑非洲各国代表的发言：来自塞内加尔、法属苏丹、达荷美、喀麦隆、象牙海岸、刚果、卢安达—乌隆迪，以及葡属安哥拉和在南非联邦种族主义者统治下的西南非洲的代表，他们用激昂慷慨的语调，控诉殖民主义者的无穷罪恶，痛斥帝国主义者的各种阴谋，拆穿新殖民主义者玩弄假“独立”，假“援助”的无耻欺骗，他们坚决要求立即独立，而且决心用斗争手段来彻底结束帝国主义和殖民主义者的侵略、奴役。他们热烈同情和支持阿尔及利亚的民族解放战争，认为这是“亚非人民争取自由解放的奋不顾身的斗争的象征。”喀麦隆人民联盟主席穆米埃在发言中，愤怒地谴责法帝国主义者对争取独立自由的喀麦隆人民的武装镇压以及美、法帝国主义者狼狈为奸的勾当；他坚决表示，喀麦隆人民将进行武装斗争到底，而且将成立临时革命政府。
    非洲的人民不仅要求政治独立，而且认为必须有真正的经济独立，才能获得完整的政治独立。拿黑非洲来说，它的土地是非常富饶的，人民是勤劳、朴质和勇敢的。所谓愚昧和落后，完全是西方“文明”强盗几百年来穷凶极恶的奴役掠夺所造成的惨痛结果。大家知道，在西非海岸，曾经进行过大规模的猎捕黑人作为奴隶的“贸易”，那些白色的“文明人”把捕捉来的黑人当作活的“货物”，运往美洲贩卖。据各种统计，这些黑人奴隶在被猎捕和贩运途中，要死去五个才能留下一个活的。几百年间运往美洲的至少有几千万人。同时，西方殖民者的垄断公司在非洲大量圈取土地，驱使黑人从事强迫劳动，用最低价收购黑人的农产品，运往欧洲获取巨额利润，同时用高价把劣质的消费品卖给黑人，把他们仅有的一点血汗收入也榨取得干干净净。
    我们从几内亚就可以看到西非的经济情况。这里沿海地区河道纵横，雨量充足，林木繁茂，矿藏丰富。科纳克里每年降雨量达到四米，到处有高大茂密的芒果树、棕榈和椰子林。这里的土地是朱红色的，有含铁量达60％以上的铁矿，还有丰富的铝矿。几内亚人民本来种植水稻，作为粮食；但是自从法国殖民者到来后，强迫他们改种香蕉，让殖民者可以垄断这种单一的出口产品的价格，进行穷凶极恶的榨取掠夺。黑非洲许多国家都被法国殖民者强迫改种单一的经济作物：塞内加尔种植花生，法属苏丹种植棉花，达荷美种植含油棕榈，象牙海岸种植可可和咖啡。除了这样的经济掠夺之外，殖民统治者还强迫人民进行“义务劳动”——实际上是用武装驱使黑人到几百里外进行无偿的奴隶劳动。非洲的港口、公路、铁路以及其他现代化设施，都是这些号称“文明”的白人用黑人的血汗和骨头建造起来的。这次大会后，我们曾到离科纳克里六十哩外的一个城市去旅行参观，当我们的汽车在宽阔的公路上疾驶前进时，我不禁想到三十年前曾在非洲旅行的法国记者阿利伯·伦特在“黑非洲”一书中写下的话，他用忏悔的口吻告诉法国人：应该用鲜花铺满这些道路，因为“只有这样做，才能在每一根枕木上追悼每一个献身于文明的黑人！”
    非洲人民在争取独立和自由的斗争中，是不会忘记这些血痕斑斑的历史的。这次大会闭幕之日，我们在总统府的招待晚会上，看到几内亚国家舞蹈团的演出，其中有几个是用民族舞蹈表演具有政治内容的节目。一个是法国殖民者的警察在搜查人身时故意栽赃，把一个黑人用枪杀死，强奸了他的妻子，还抢夺了他的财产。又一个是描写强迫劳动的惨酷情况：监工者像猎犬一样，对一些疲劳不堪的黑人用皮鞭毒打，让他们遍地翻滚，直到死去；最后黑人起来反抗，夺下皮鞭，把监工打死，一齐获得了解放。这些情节，在独立了的几内亚，已经是过去的事情了，而在大部分的黑非洲国家，则还是活生生的现实。
    我们见到，来自亚非各国，特别是非洲的代表们，随着表演的情节和剧烈的舞蹈动作而表示同样的愤怒和激昂的情绪。当他们看到另一个节目表现独立后的几内亚人民庆祝丰收，特别是劳动果实归自己所有的时候，他们又是多么兴奋和羡慕啊。这种感情的激动，在大会闭幕后一天的群众大会上，当大家看到成千上万的几内亚妇女和儿童，穿着花花绿绿的新装，在街上载歌载舞的时候，更加充分地表现出来了。有的代表说，非洲尚未独立国家的人们看到这种自由欢乐的景象，不知将增加多少斗争的勇气！
    这次科纳克里大会所取得的成就，是非常巨大的。它标志着亚非人民高举反帝国主义反殖民主义的大旗，团结在一起进行斗争的一个新阶段。我们特别高兴的是，黑非洲的人民都站起来了，他们正在迸发出无穷的力量，扫除几百年来帝国主义和殖民主义者强加在他们身上的屈辱和黑暗。我们深信，他们都将重见光明，取得胜利。这是历史的潮流，任何力量都阻止不了它的。
