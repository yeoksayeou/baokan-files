Xinhua News Agency, 11th dispatch: Singapore National Development Minister Ong Eng Guan said that colonialist forces in Singapore are still very powerful.

He said that it is necessary to make the people of Singapore aware of this situation, and that only by uniting the strength of people at all levels to jointly resist colonialist forces will it be possible to strive for a better society.

Ong Eng Guan made these remarks on the 7th at the Singapore Rural People's United Association's celebration of its third anniversary. He said that colonialism has forces in many departments of Singapore. He said that if these colonialist forces are maintained, Singapore will face many difficulties in striving for the interests of the people and realizing industrialization.

He also said that currently, British troops occupy 10% of Singapore's total land area. This land is beyond the control of the Singapore government, which is a difficulty faced by the Singapore government.

Singaporean lawyer and former People's Action Party Secretary-General Raja, also said in his speech at the conference that there are British troops carrying guns everywhere on the streets of Singapore, which shows that Singapore's independence is incomplete.

Raja also pointed out that the United States, the representative of capitalist countries, is now weakening and falling, while another system in the world, socialist countries, is like the rising sun, and no force can stop its rise.

    新加坡国家发展部长王永元说
    必须联合各阶层力量共同抵抗殖民主义
    新华社11日讯　新加坡国家发展部长王永元说，目前在新加坡的殖民主义势力仍然很强大。
    他说，必须使新加坡人民认识这种情况，并且只有联合各阶层人民的力量共同抵抗殖民主义势力，才有可能争取一个较美好的社会。
    王永元7日在新加坡乡村人民联合会庆祝成立三周年纪念大会上说了这番话。他说，殖民主义在新加坡的许多部门都拥有势力。他说，如果继续保持这些殖民主义势力，新加坡要争取人民的利益、实现工业化是有很多困难的。
    他还说，目前，英国军队占领着新加坡全部土地面积的10％。这些土地是新加坡政府所无法控制的，这是新加坡政府面对的一个困难。
    新加坡律师、前人民行动党总书记拉惹在大会上致词时也说，目前在新加坡的街道上到处都有背着枪杆的英国军队，这说明新加坡的独立是不完全的。
    拉惹同时指出，目前资本主义国家的代表美国正在衰弱地倒下去，而世界上另一个体系社会主义国家却像东升的太阳，任何力量都不能阻挡它的上升。
