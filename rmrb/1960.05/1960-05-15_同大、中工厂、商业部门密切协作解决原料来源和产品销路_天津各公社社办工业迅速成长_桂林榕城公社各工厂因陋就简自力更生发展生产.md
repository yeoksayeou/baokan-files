This newspaper reports: Tianjin's urban people's communes' commune-run industries, working closely with the city's large and medium-sized factories and commercial departments, have solved problems such as product sales and raw material sources, and are rapidly developing along the road from small to large, from indigenous to modern.

Tianjin's urban people's communes' industries were all started from scratch, with poor equipment and a weak foundation. The vast majority of production personnel were housewives who had just left their homes, with low technical levels and a lack of experience in factory management. However, while continuously improving the level of commune-run industries through self-reliance, the communes organized cooperation between commune-run industries and large and medium-sized factories, commercial departments, commune to commune, and within the commune, enabling commune-run industries to quickly overcome various difficulties at the beginning and grow rapidly. Now, many commune-run factories have become "satellite factories" of large factories. They use the offcuts, scraps, and waste materials of large factories for production, specifically serving large factories, solving the needs of large factories for certain products and the shortage of labor. They also produce many products to supply the market, supplementing the deficiencies of large industries, playing a role in "picking up the leftovers and making up for the deficiencies," enabling large factories and commune-run industries to form two legs, advancing together. The Huidui Commune used waste paper pulp, paper scraps, and waste liquid from the state-owned Tianjin Paper Mill to establish nine satellite factories, including a small paper mill, a bookbinding factory, a cardboard box factory, an aluminum sulfate factory, and a plasticizer factory. These commune-run factories used local materials, had both a source of raw materials and sales channels, and developed very rapidly. Among them, the aluminum sulfate factory used the slag and exhaust gas from the paper mill to manufacture aluminum sulfate, producing 41 tons last year alone, meeting a quarter of the paper mill's needs. The Zhongshanmen Commune Iron Factory was originally built with the help of large factories such as the Tianjin No. 1 Steel Plant. Now, this iron factory has been processing parts for more than 120 large factories. In late February, the Tianjin No. 1 Steel Plant installed a medium-sized rolling mill and needed more than 2,100 overhead crane plates urgently. The commune iron factory enthusiastically accepted this task. Commune members worked day and night, making and sending batches of plates, completing the task ahead of schedule. Once, late at night, the steel plant needed the iron factory to help rush-produce steel cutting blades to complete an urgent task. Commune members immediately got up and worked overnight, delivering the blades to the steel plant by five o'clock in the morning. The workers gratefully said, "Your iron factory is really a good helper for us!" Recently, 158 commune-run factories and 73 state-owned factories in the seven people's communes of the Hexi District solved 179 major problems at once through a cooperation meeting, which made both the large factories and commune-run factories very satisfied.

Most of Tianjin's large and medium-sized factories also mobilized their employees to help commune-run industries solve difficulties in production technology and business management. Since most commune-run industries have simple equipment and rely on manual operation, and the technical level of workers is low, they cannot adapt to the needs of rapid production development. Therefore, commune-run industries urgently need to carry out technological revolution and technological transformation. Many large factories took the initiative to mobilize workers to help commune-run factories carry out technological innovation and technological revolution during cooperation. Some factories launched a campaign among employees to do good deeds for the communes, organized technical promotion teams to go to commune-run factories to impart technology, exchange experience, and help commune-run factories carry out mechanization, automation, and train technical workers. According to statistics from the five districts of Heping, Hexi, Hongqiao, Hedong, and Hebei, in the past month alone, 384 large factories have sent more than 1,100 technicians to help commune-run factories carry out technological innovation, impart technology, and train technicians, while accepting more than 7,800 commune members to systematically learn technology in the factories. In addition, employees of 320 factories used their spare time to help commune-run factories implement more than 3,300 technological innovation projects and taught more than 7,900 commune members to master one or several operating techniques.

The cooperation between commune industries and commercial departments has also greatly promoted the development of commune industries, while providing a large number of small commodities for commercial departments and meeting market needs. The most prosperous commercial district of Quanyechang in Tianjin is based on large stores and commercial organizations to help commune-run industries arrange and organize production, solve raw materials, guarantee sales of products, impart technology and train technical workers. According to market needs, the Zhongyuan Company, which sells women's and children's products, helped the Wannianqing branch of the Quanyechang Commune establish six factories for casual shoes, children's woodenware, and embroidery. It also organized a technical training team with 92 veteran technicians to perform techniques and spread advanced experience in various workshops of the commune. Since April, it has helped workers in eight workshops learn the production technology of 36 kinds of commodities and trained 46 technical personnel for commune-run factories. The small commodities produced by commune-run industries have also increased the source of goods for Zhongyuan Company, especially increasing the commodities that are relatively scarce in the market. Among the new commodities added by Zhongyuan Company in early April, 92 kinds were produced by commune-run factories. More than 690 kinds of large children's toys supplied by the knitted goods department were all products of the commune's children's woodenware factory. Now, commune-run industries have become an important force in supplying commercial departments with small commodities to meet market needs. There are thousands of types of products such as hairpins, including more than 1,300 main products.

Nanning, Guangxi, 12th. This newspaper reports: The commune-run industry of Rongcheng People's Commune, Guilin City, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, has made great progress in the past year or so according to the needs of urban construction and implementing the principle of self-reliance. Now the whole commune has 145 factories (production groups) in hardware, chemical, and lime, with 1,870 employees. In 1959, the total industrial output value increased seven times compared with 1958. This year, the output value from January to April alone increased by one time than that of the whole last year, reaching 3.61 million yuan. The variety of products increased from 32 in 1958 to the current 83. Since the beginning of this year, there has been a great effort in technological innovation and technological revolution, and each factory has realized more than 3,500 innovation projects, which has greatly improved the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization.

Rongcheng People's Commune was established in October 1958. There are 8,212 households and 26,724 people in the whole commune. As soon as this commune was established, it seized the development of production. According to the characteristics of Guilin City's heavy industrial basic construction tasks and the limited production and processing capacity of state-owned factories, they focused on developing production departments that serve state-owned industries and people's lives. In addition to transferring 3,000 residents with stronger labor force and certain production and construction experience to directly participate in the basic construction and production of state-owned factories, they also established factories (production groups) for processing, repairing, packaging, and manufacturing finished and semi-finished products for large factories as assistants to large factories. For example, the woodenware factory processes iron sieves for the Guilin Iron and Steel Plant and the Guilin Machinery Plant, and the hardware factory processes welding rods for the Guilin Machine Tool Plant. A lime factory was also established to provide raw materials for basic construction and large-scale industrial production. Since last July, the commune's lime factory has produced 700 tons of lime for large factories such as the Guilin Iron and Steel Plant and the Guilin Machinery Plant. In addition, the commune also organizes housewives to participate in sewing, making straw sandals, twisting hemp ropes, and other production activities according to their specific circumstances. According to the needs of the market at each period, they adopt concentrated, decentralized, seasonal, and long-term production methods to produce a large number of products to meet the needs of the market.

Rongcheng Commune has always adhered to the policy of self-reliance by starting with simple means, from small to large, from indigenous to modern. In the early stage of establishing factories, the commune lacked equipment, funds, and raw materials, and there were very few technical forces, but these difficulties were solved by the masses through self-reliance. They built a large number of native machines and manufactured more than 200 machines of various types such as files, punches, and paper machines, and gradually solved the equipment problem. In order to solve the difficulty of raw materials, they adopted methods such as linking up with commercial departments, linking up with large factories, using side materials and waste materials from large factories, and carrying out comprehensive utilization. The chemical factory made great efforts in the comprehensive utilization of native alkali and barite. Since early April, it has produced 7.5 tons of barium carbonate and other materials.

Due to the vigorous development of commune production, the living standards of commune members have been greatly improved. The average monthly salary of commune employees is 27.4 yuan per person. Before the establishment of the commune, there were 723 people in the whole commune who depended on government relief for their lives.

With the development of production, 5,600 residents of Rongcheng participated in production and various service jobs, of which more than 80% were women. In order to free them from household chores, the commune held collective welfare undertakings centered on canteens. At present, the whole commune has set up 40 canteens, 17 nurseries, and 35 production service stations, and more than 80% of residents eat in the canteens. The new trend of commune members loving labor and loving the collective is constantly growing. The political awareness is also constantly improving. Since the establishment of the commune, 26 residents have joined the party, and 66 people have been rated as red flag bearers and advanced workers.

    桂林榕城公社各工厂因陋就简自力更生发展生产
    本报讯　天津市区各人民公社的社办工业，同全市大、中工厂和商业部门密切协作，解决了产品销路和原料来源等问题，正沿着由小到大、由土到洋的道路迅速向前发展。
    天津市区各人民公社的工业，都是白手起家办起来的，设备差、底子薄，绝大部分生产人员又是刚走出家门的家庭妇女，技术水平低，对工厂的经营管理缺乏经验。但是，由于各公社在自力更生不断提高社办工业水平的同时，组织了社办工业与大、中工厂、商业部门、公社与公社、公社内部之间的协作，使社办工业迅速地克服了初办时的各种困难，一日千里地成长壮大起来。现在，许多社办工厂已经成为大工厂的“卫星工厂”，它们利用大工厂的边料、下脚料和废料进行生产，专门为大工厂服务，解决了大工厂对某些产品的需要和劳动力不足的问题，并且生产了许多产品供应市场，补充了大工业的不足，起到了“拾遗补缺”的作用，使大工厂和社办工业形成两条腿，双双跃进。灰堆公社利用国营天津造纸总厂的废纸浆、碎纸头和废药液等下脚料和废料，建立了小造纸厂、制本厂、纸盒厂、硫酸铝厂、塑化剂厂等九个卫星工厂。这些社办工厂就地取材，既有原料来源，又有销路，发展非常迅速。其中硫酸铝厂利用造纸总厂的炉渣和废气等制造硫酸铝，去年一年就生产了四十一吨，满足了造纸总厂需要量的四分之一。中山门公社铁工厂原是由天津第一钢厂等大厂帮助建起来的，现在这个铁工厂已经为一百二十多个大工厂加工配件。2月下旬天津第一钢厂安装中型轧板机，需要二千一百多块天车轧板，任务很急。公社铁工厂热情地接受了这项任务，社员们昼夜突击，做出一批送去一批，提前完成了任务。有一次深夜，钢厂为完成一项紧急任务，要求铁工厂协助赶制切钢刀片，社员们立即起床夜战，到清晨五点钟就把刀片送到钢厂，工人们感激地说：“你们铁工厂真是我们好帮手！”最近，河西区七个人民公社的一百五十八个社办工厂和七十三个国营工厂通过召开协作会议，一次就解决了一百七十九项重大问题，使得大工厂和社办工厂都很满意。
    天津市的多数大、中工厂，还发动职工多方面帮助社办工业解决生产技术、经营管理等方面的困难问题。由于社办工业多数设备简陋、手工操作较多，工人技术水平低，不能适应生产迅速发展的需要，因此，社办工业迫切需要进行技术革命和技术改造。许多大工厂在协作中就主动发动工人帮助社办工厂大搞技术革新和技术革命，有的工厂在职工中展开为公社办好事运动，组织了技术推广队到社办工厂去传授技术、交流经验，帮助社办工厂大搞机械化、自动化和培养技术工人。据和平、河西、红桥、河东、河北五个区的统计，在最近的一个月里，就有三百八十四个大工厂派出一千一百多名技术工人去帮助社办工厂搞技术革新、传授技术和培训技术工人，同时接受了七千八百多名公社社员到工厂去系统地学习技术；并且有三百二十个工厂的职工，利用业余时间帮助社办工厂实现了三千三百多项技术革新项目，还教会七千九百多名社员掌握了一种或几种操作技术。
    公社工业和商业部门的协作，也大大促进了公社工业的发展，同时为商业部门提供了大量的小商品，满足了市场需要。天津市最繁华的劝业场一带商业区，就是以大商店和商业机关为基点，帮助社办工业安排组织生产，解决原材料，包销产品，传授技术和培训技术工人等。出售妇女和儿童用品的中原公司根据市场需要，帮助劝业场公社万年青分社建立了便鞋、儿童木器、绣花等六个工厂，还组织了有九十二名老技术工人参加的技术传授队，到公社各车间表演技术，传播先进经验，4月份以来就帮助八个车间的工人学会了三十六种商品的生产技术，还为社办工厂培养了四十六名技术人才。社办工业生产的小商品也使中原公司增加了货源，特别是增加了市场上比较短缺的商品。在4月上旬中原公司新添的商品中，就有九十二种是社办工厂生产的，针织百货部供应市场的六百九十多种大型儿童玩具，全部是公社儿童木器厂的产品。现在，社办工业已经成为供应商业部门小商品满足市场需要的一支重要力量，产品种类有发夹等几千种，其中主要产品就有一千三百多种。
    本报南宁12日电　广西僮族自治区桂林市榕城人民公社的社办工业，根据城市建设的需要，贯彻自力更生的原则，一年多来有很大发展。现在全社已经拥有五金、化工、石灰等工厂（生产组）一百四十五个，职工一千八百七十人。1959年工业总产值比1958年增长七倍，今年仅1至4月份的产值，就比去年全年的产值增长一倍，达到三百六十一万元。产品品种由1958年的三十二种增加到目前的八十三种。今年以来又大闹技术革新和技术革命，各厂已经实现三千五百多件革新项目，使机械化、半机械化的程度大大提高。
    榕城人民公社是1958年10月成立的，全社共有八千二百一十二户，二万六千七百二十四人。这个公社一建立，就抓紧发展生产。他们根据桂林市工业基本建设任务繁重、国营工厂多属新建，生产和加工能力有限的特点，着重发展了为国营工业、为人民生活服务的生产部门。除了抽调劳动力较强，有一定生产建设经验的三千名居民直接参加基本建设和国营工厂的生产外，还建立了为大工厂加工、修配、包装和制造成品、半成品的工厂（生产组），作为大工厂的助手。如木器厂为桂林钢铁厂、桂林机械厂加工铁筛子，五金厂为桂林机床厂加工电焊条等。还建立了为基本建设、大工业生产原料材料的石灰厂等，去年7月以来，公社石灰厂已为桂林钢铁厂、桂林机械厂等大工厂生产了七百吨石灰。此外，公社还组织家庭妇女根据各人的具体情况，参加缝纫、打草鞋、搓麻绳等生产。他们根据市场每个时期的需要，采取有集中、有分散、有季节性、也有长年性的生产方式，生产了大量产品供应市场的需要。
    榕城公社发展社办工业，始终坚持因陋就简，由小到大，从土到洋，自力更生的方针。办厂初期，公社缺乏设备、资金和原料，技术力量也很少，但这些困难都由群众自力更生地解决了。他们大造土机器，曾经制造了锉床、冲床、造纸机等各种机器二百多台，逐步地解决了设备问题。为了解决原材料的困难，他们采取与商业部门挂钩、与大工厂挂钩、利用大厂边材废材、大搞综合利用等办法。化工厂利用土碱和重晶石大搞综合利用，4月上旬以来，已生产碳酸钡等七点五吨。
    由于公社生产蓬勃发展，社员的生活水平有了很大提高。公社职工平均每人每月工资是二十七点四元。公社成立前，全社有七百二十三人靠政府救济为生。
    随着生产的发展，榕城有五千六百名居民参加了生产和各种服务工作，其中有80％以上是妇女，为了使她们摆脱家务牵累，公社举办了以食堂为中心的集体福利事业。目前，全公社已办起食堂四十个，托儿组织十七个，生产服务站三十五个，有80％以上居民都在食堂吃饭。社员中热爱劳动、热爱集体的新风尚正在不断成长。政治觉悟也在不断提高，公社建立以来，已有二十六个居民入党，被评为红旗手、先进工作者的有六十六人。
