Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, May 14th: People of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, who once suffered fourteen years of cruel rule by Japanese imperialism, held a grand rally of 150,000 people today in Hohhot, the capital of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, to firmly support the Japanese people's just struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.

    Wang Zaitian, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Vice Chairman of the Autonomous Region, said in his speech at the meeting: The U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty signed by the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries is a thoroughgoing aggressive military alliance treaty aimed primarily at China and the Soviet Union, hostile to the people of Asian countries and the people of the world. It is also a serious provocation to the people of China, the Soviet Union, and Asian countries, and cannot be tolerated by the Chinese people, the people of Asian countries, and all peace-loving countries and people. U.S. imperialism's revival of Japanese militarism is dragging the Japanese people back into the abyss of war, death, and disaster, and is completely contrary to the path of independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality desired by the Japanese people. At a time when U.S. imperialism is reviving Japanese militarism and turning Japan into a source of aggressive war, we cannot forget that in 1931, when Japanese imperialism invaded Northeast China, it also invaded the eastern part of Inner Mongolia. In 1935, it further invaded the western part of Inner Mongolia, turning our beloved hometown into a hell on earth under the rule of Japanese imperialism, and our compatriots in Inner Mongolia experienced fourteen years of slave life. We are determined to join the people of our motherland in firmly supporting the just struggle of the Japanese people, resolutely preventing history from repeating itself, and fighting to the end to completely smash the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and to completely defeat the war schemes of U.S. imperialism.

    Sun Lanfeng, Vice Chairman of the Inner Mongolia Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, angrily condemned the U.S. imperialist plot to revive Japanese militarism in his speech. He said: U.S. imperialism is the chief culprit in disturbing world peace and undermining world peace, and is the number one enemy of the people of the world. It has done all kinds of bad things and is full of evil. We believe that with the strong support of the people of the world, the Japanese people will be able to completely smash the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and drive the domineering U.S. imperialist aggressive forces out of Japanese territory.

    The heads of the Inner Mongolia CPPCC, the Federation of Trade Unions, the Women's Federation, and the Communist Youth League also spoke at the meeting. They unanimously supported the just struggle of the Japanese people against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and angrily condemned the U.S. imperialist plot to revive Japanese militarism and expand its military.

    After the meeting, the angry crowds began a large-scale demonstration march to the tune of "Oppose Arming Japan" and "Unity is Strength." Zhang E'e, an old peasant woman who suffered severe persecution during the Japanese imperialist "kill all, burn all, loot all" ("Three Alls") policy, came early this morning from the suburbs more than 20 miles away to participate in the demonstration. In the demonstration procession, she asked the young women around her to remember the past disasters and be vigilant against the war schemes of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries. People's soldiers of Mongolian, Han, Hui, and other ethnic groups who were honorably wounded in the War of Resistance Against Japan also came from the Inner Mongolia Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers Rehabilitation Center to participate in the mass rally today. In the marching ranks, there were also armed militiamen in neat formation.

    Hu Zhaoheng, Alternate Secretary of the Secretariat of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and the heads of the Party, government, and army of Hohhot City, as well as Soviet and Mongolian experts in Inner Mongolia, also participated in today's meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, May 14th: Today, 100,000 people in Urumqi held a large-scale rally and demonstration to firmly support the Japanese people's just struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.

    Dozens of streets in Urumqi, plastered with slogans condemning the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries, were filled with demonstrators today. The orderly demonstration procession passed through the Urumqi River Bridge and Jiefang Road, pouring into the People's Square from all directions. Highly spirited workers, peasants, militiamen, government cadres, young students, and residents of all ethnic groups carried huge slogan boards written in Chinese, Uyghur, and Kazakh, and shouted in unison, "U.S. imperialism, get out of Japan!" "Down with U.S. imperialism!" As the marching队伍 passed through Ahemaitijiang Road, workers and cadres who were carrying out production and work in the buildings on both sides pushed open the windows and shouted slogans along with the demonstrators.

    At 1:30 p.m., the demonstration队伍 gathered in People's Square to hold a mass rally. Qi Guo and Lin Bomin, Alternate Secretaries of the Secretariat of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Yimin Nuofu, Vice Chairman of the Autonomous Region, Sun Zhe and Maimaitiming Yusuofu, Secretaries of the Urumqi Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Yasheng Hudabai'er, Mayor of Urumqi, attended the rally. Soviet consular personnel and Soviet and Hungarian experts in Urumqi also attended the rally.

    Qi Guo, Alternate Secretary of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, spoke at the meeting. He said that U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the people of the world, and the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" that it colluded with the Japanese reactionaries to conclude is a military treaty for aggression against Asia, and the spearhead of aggression is directly pointed at China, the Soviet Union, Korea, Vietnam, and other Asian countries. U.S. imperialism and Japanese imperialism once invaded China for a long time, and to this day U.S. imperialism still occupies our territory of Taiwan. The Chinese people, who have suffered greatly from the aggression of U.S. and Japanese imperialism, resolutely oppose the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and resolutely oppose the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries' plot to plan a new war. Qi Guo told the angry masses: "Now the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, have stood up strongly and are sufficient to crush any imperialist aggression. The Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty is related to the vital interests of the Japanese people and also to the vital interests of the Chinese people. We regard the Japanese people's anti-U.S. patriotic struggle as our own struggle." At this time, 100,000 people in the square shouted in unison: "The people of China and Japan unite, the people of the world unite, and down with U.S. imperialism!"

    Yiming Mahsum, Vice Chairman of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region CPPCC and Director of the Autonomous Region Islamic Association, paid high tribute to the Japanese people who are engaged in heroic struggle in his speech on behalf of the Muslims of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. He said that the Muslims of Xinjiang, together with the people of the whole country, vow to support the patriotic and just struggle of the Japanese people with all their strength. The heads of the Autonomous Region Federation of Trade Unions, the Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Autonomous Region Women's Federation, and various people's organizations, as well as representatives of workers, peasants, militiamen, and students, also spoke at the meeting one after another. They all expressed their firm support for the Japanese people's anti-U.S. patriotic struggle.

    The meeting adopted a telegram of support for the Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty amid the excited slogans of the masses.

    呼和浩特、乌鲁木齐二十五万人愤怒集会
    制止美帝国主义复活日本军国主义
    新华社  呼和浩特14日电　曾经遭受过日本帝国主义十四年残酷统治的内蒙古自治区各族人民，今天在内蒙古自治区首府——呼和浩特市举行了十五万人的盛大集会，坚决支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的正义斗争。
    中共内蒙古自治区委员会书记处书记、自治区副主席王再天在会上讲话，他说：美日反动派签订的日美军事同盟条约，是一个彻头彻尾的、以中国和苏联为主要对象的、敌视亚洲各国人民和世界人民的侵略性的军事同盟条约，也是向中国、苏联和亚洲各国人民的严重挑衅，是中国人民和亚洲各国人民以及一切爱好和平的国家和人民所不能容许的。美帝国主义复活日本军国主义，是把日本人民再度拖向战争、死亡和灾难的深渊，是完全和日本人民所要求的独立、民主、和平和中立的道路背道而驰的。在美帝国主义复活日本军国主义、变日本为侵略战争策源地的今天，我们不能忘记1931年日本帝国主义在侵占我国东北的同时，侵占了内蒙古东部地区，1935年更进一步向内蒙古西部地区进犯，从此，使我们可爱的家乡变成了日本帝国主义统治下的人间地狱，使我们内蒙古同胞经历了十四年的奴隶生活。我们决心和祖国人民一道，坚决支持日本人民的正义斗争，决不允许历史重演，要为彻底粉碎美日军事同盟条约、为彻底打垮美帝国主义的战争阴谋而奋斗到底。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会内蒙古分会副主席孙兰峰在讲话中愤怒谴责了美帝国主义复活日本军国主义的阴谋。他说：美帝国主义是扰乱世界安宁、破坏世界和平的罪魁祸首，是全世界人民的头号公敌。它已把坏事作尽，已经恶贯满盈。我们相信在全世界人民的大力支持下，日本人民一定能够彻底粉碎日美军事同盟条约，把横行霸道的美帝国主义侵略势力从日本领土上驱逐出去。
    内蒙古政协、总工会、妇联和共青团的负责人也在会上讲话，他们一致支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的正义斗争，并愤怒地谴责美帝国主义复活日本军国主义、扩军备战的阴谋。
    大会结束后，愤怒的人群在“反对武装日本”和“团结就是力量”歌声中开始了声势浩大的示威游行。在日本帝国主义推行“烧光、杀光、抢光”的“三光”政策时，受到严重迫害的老农妇张娥娥，今天一早从二十多里外的郊区赶来参加了示威，她在示威队伍里要周围的年轻妇女们记住过去的灾难，警惕日美反动派的战争阴谋。在抗日战争中光荣负伤的蒙古、汉、回等族人民战士，今天也从内蒙古革命残废军人教养院赶来参加了群众大会。在游行队伍中，还有武装整齐的民兵。
    中共内蒙古自治区委员会书记处候补书记胡昭衡和呼和浩特市党、政府和军队的负责人，以及在内蒙古的苏联、蒙古专家，也参加了今天的大会。
    新华社乌鲁木齐14日电　乌鲁木齐市今天有十万人举行大规模的集会和示威游行，坚决支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的正义斗争。
    贴满了谴责美日反动派标语的乌鲁木齐市几十条大街，今天拥满了示威的人群。严整的示威队伍通过乌鲁木齐河大桥和解放路，从四面八方涌向人民广场。情绪激昂的各民族工人、农民、民兵、机关干部、青年学生和居民，抬着用汉文、维吾尔文、哈萨克文书写的巨大标语牌，齐声高呼“美帝国主义从日本滚出去！”“打倒美帝国主义！”当游行队伍通过阿合买提江路时，两旁楼上正在进行生产和工作的工人、干部，推开楼窗，和示威队伍一起高呼口号。
    下午一时半，游行队伍集中在人民广场举行群众大会。参加大会的有中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会书记处候补书记祁果、林渤民，自治区副主席伊敏诺夫，中共乌鲁木齐市委书记孙哲、买买提伊明·玉素甫，乌鲁木齐市市长牙生·胡达拜尔。在乌鲁木齐的苏联领事人员和苏联、匈牙利专家也参加了大会。
    中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会候补书记祁果在大会上讲了话。他说，美帝国主义是全世界人民最凶恶的敌人，它和日本反动派勾结订立的新日美“安全条约”，是侵略亚洲的军事条约，侵略矛头直接指向中国、苏联、朝鲜、越南及其他亚洲国家。美帝国主义和日本帝国主义曾经长期侵略中国，至今美帝国主义还霸占着我国领土台湾。饱受美、日帝国主义侵略苦难的中国人民坚决反对日美军事同盟条约，坚决反对美日反动派策划新战争的阴谋。祁果向愤怒的群众说：“现在中国人民在中国共产党的领导下已经坚强地站起来了，足以粉碎任何帝国主义的侵犯。日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争，关系日本人民的切身利益，也关系中国人民的切身利益。我们把日本人民的反美爱国斗争看作是自己的斗争。”这时，广场上十万人齐声高呼：“中日两国人民团结起来，全世界人民团结起来，打倒美帝国主义！”
    新疆维吾尔自治区政协副主席、自治区伊斯兰教协会主任伊明·马合苏木代表新疆各族穆斯林们，在讲话中向正在进行英勇斗争的日本人民致崇高的敬意。他说，新疆穆斯林们和全国人民一道，誓以全力支持日本人民的爱国正义斗争。自治区工会、共青团自治区委员会、自治区妇联和各人民团体的负责人，工人、农民、民兵和学生的代表也相继在大会上讲话。他们一致表示坚决支持日本人民的反美爱国斗争。
    大会在群众激昂的口号声中，通过了支援日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的通电。
