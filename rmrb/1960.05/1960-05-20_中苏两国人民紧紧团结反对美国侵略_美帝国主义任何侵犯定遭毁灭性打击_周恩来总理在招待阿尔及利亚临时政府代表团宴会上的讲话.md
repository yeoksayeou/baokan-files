Xinhua News Agency, 19th. Premier Zhou's speech at the banquet in honor of the delegation of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria: Respected Vice Premier Krim Belkacem, esteemed guests of the delegation of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, friends, comrades:

    We are very pleased to be able to gather again with the representatives of the heroic Algerian people, the distinguished members of the delegation of Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria. Tomorrow, our dear Algerian friends will conclude their visit to China and depart. On the eve of this farewell, I would like to once again express, on behalf of the Chinese Government and the Chinese people, our heartfelt gratitude for your friendly visit, and ask you to convey the Chinese people’s high respect and warm greetings to the Algerian people who are fighting.

    The Chinese people have always sympathized with and cared about the Algerian people’s just struggle against colonialism and to achieve national independence. The heroic Algerian people have withstood the test of more than five years of arduous struggle, overcome a series of difficulties, always holding high the banner of the national liberation war, and firmly standing at the forefront of the African people’s struggle against imperialism. The heroic struggle of the Algerian people has not only dealt a heavy blow to the French colonialists and to the American imperialists who support them, but also set a brilliant example for the African people’s struggle for national independence, and made a significant contribution to peace in Asia, Africa, and the world.

    Friends, comrades: The current international situation is very favorable to the people of Asia, Africa, and the world. The socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is growing stronger day by day. The storm of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against imperialism is becoming more and more fierce, and the united front against imperialism is expanding day by day. The struggle of the people of all countries on the African continent for national independence is increasingly closely linked with the Algerian people’s national liberation struggle. The Chinese people deeply care about and sympathize with the just struggle of the people of Guinea, Cameroon, Congo, South Africa, and other African countries for national independence, democratic freedom. In Asia, Japan, South Korea, and Turkey, which have always been under U.S. military occupation and strict control, have successively erupted into large-scale mass struggles against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs. These struggles have shaken the U.S. imperialist colonial rule in Asia and powerfully supported the anti-imperialist struggles of the people of Africa, Latin America, and the world. We are deeply convinced that as long as the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world strengthen unity and persist in struggle, we will surely be able to finally defeat imperialism headed by the United States.

    U.S. imperialism is the number one enemy of world peace. Recently, the U.S. government sent spy planes to invade Soviet territory and openly claimed that conducting aggressive spy flights is the established policy of the U.S. government. Not only that, the U.S. government flagrantly disregarded the Soviet government’s solemn protest and reasonable demands, refused to take responsibility for its crimes, and refused to make the necessary guarantees not to repeat them, making the summit meeting of great powers eagerly awaited by the world impossible to hold. This thoroughly exposed the truculent face of U.S. imperialism. The United States' agreement to hold a summit meeting of great powers was already extremely reluctant. While feigning peace, it has never stopped its frantic arms expansion and war preparations, it has created various difficulties and obstacles for the summit meeting of great powers, and has constantly spread pessimistic air that the summit meeting of great powers is doomed to failure. The fact that the summit meeting of great powers was finally sabotaged by the United States is by no means accidental. Now, the United States is even attempting to shift the responsibility for sabotaging the summit meeting of great powers onto the Soviet Union, which is truly shameless to the extreme. Comrade Khrushchev solemnly declared on behalf of the Soviet government: The Soviet Union firmly advocates peaceful coexistence, advocates negotiations, and advocates reaching wise and mutually acceptable agreements; however, no provocation by anyone can intimidate the Soviet Union, can intimidate socialist countries, and it is impossible for us to submit; only on the basis of equality, without threats and blackmail, can one speak and negotiate with us, and it must be so. This is the voice of the great Soviet people, and it also represents the position of the entire socialist camp. The Chinese government and the Chinese people resolutely support a series of solemn measures recently taken by the Soviet government against the provocative crimes of U.S. imperialism. Six hundred and fifty million Chinese people will continue to unite closely with the great Soviet people, with the people of all socialist countries, and with all peace-loving people in the world, and will continue to work unremittingly to ease international tensions and strive for lasting world peace. We want to solemnly warn the U.S. government: It will not work to treat us with an imperialist attitude; do not regard the peaceful efforts of socialist countries as a sign of weakness; an aggression against any socialist country is an aggression against China, is an aggression against the entire socialist camp, and must be met with a devastating counterattack.

    The Chinese people have special feelings for the Algerian people. Common historical experiences and the common struggle against imperialism have closely linked the people of our two countries. The Chinese people have learned from their own experience that the power of the people is infinite, while imperialism is nothing but a paper tiger. The Algerian people’s struggle is by no means isolated. Those who oppose you are only a handful of imperialist elements. Standing firmly on your side are hundreds of millions of people in Asia and Africa and all peace-loving and justice-upholding people in the world. The people are the decisive factor. Relying on their own unity and struggle, and with the sympathy and support of the people of all countries in the world, the Algerian people will surely be able to finally defeat imperialism and win their own independence and freedom after a long and arduous struggle.

    Respected Vice Premier Krim Belkacem, on the eve of this farewell, please allow me, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, to express our heartfelt gratitude for your sincere efforts to strengthen Sino-Algerian friendship, and please tell the broad masses of Algerian people that our six hundred and fifty million Chinese people will always stand on the side of the heroic Algerian people who oppose imperialism and strive for national independence.

    I propose:

    For the victory of the Algerian people’s national independence struggle,
    For the friendship between the Chinese and Algerian people,
    For the victory of the national democratic movement in Asia, Africa, and Latin America,
    For Asian-African solidarity and friendly cooperation,
    For peace in Asia, Africa, and the world,
    For the health of Premier Abbas,
    For the health of Vice Premier Krim Belkacem and the distinguished Algerian guests,
    Cheers!

    中苏两国人民紧紧团结反对美国侵略
    美帝国主义任何侵犯定遭毁灭性打击
    周恩来总理在招待阿尔及利亚临时政府代表团宴会上的讲话
    新华社19日讯　周总理在招待阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团宴会上的讲话：尊敬的克里姆·贝勒卡塞姆副总理阁下，尊敬的阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团的贵宾们，朋友们，同志们：
    我们非常高兴能够同英雄的阿尔及利亚人民的代表，阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团的全体贵宾们再度欢聚一堂。明天，我们亲爱的阿尔及利亚的朋友们就要结束在中国的访问，离开中国了。在这临别的前夕，我谨代表中国政府和中国人民再一次对你们的友好访问表示衷心的感谢，并且请你们把中国人民的崇高敬意和热烈问候转达给战斗中的阿尔及利亚人民。
    中国人民一向同情和关怀阿尔及利亚人民反对殖民主义、争取民族独立的正义斗争。英雄的阿尔及利亚人民经历了五年多艰苦斗争的考验，克服了一系列的困难，始终高举着民族解放战争的大旗，坚定地站在非洲人民反对帝国主义斗争的最前线。阿尔及利亚人民的英勇斗争不仅给了法国殖民主义者以沉重的打击，给了支持法国殖民主义者的美帝国主义以沉重的打击，而且为非洲人民的民族独立斗争树立了光辉的榜样，对亚非和世界的和平作出了重大的贡献。
    朋友们，同志们：当前的国际形势对亚非和世界人民十分有利。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营日益壮大。亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民反对帝国主义的斗争风暴一天比一天更加猛烈，反对帝国主义的统一战线一天比一天更加扩大。非洲大陆各国人民争取民族独立的斗争越来越紧密地同阿尔及利亚人民的民族解放斗争连接在一起。中国人民深切地关注和同情几内亚人民、喀麦隆人民、刚果人民、南非人民和非洲其它各国人民争取和维护民族独立、民主自由的正义斗争。在亚洲，一向处于美国军事占领和严密控制下的日本、南朝鲜和土耳其相继爆发了反对美帝国主义及其走狗的声势浩大的群众斗争，这些斗争震憾了美帝国主义在亚洲的殖民统治，有力地支持了非洲人民、拉丁美洲人民以及全世界人民的反帝斗争。我们深信，只要我们亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和全世界各国人民加强团结，坚持斗争，我们就一定能够最后战胜以美国为首的帝国主义。
    美国帝国主义是世界和平的头号敌人。最近，美国政府派遣间谍飞机侵犯苏联国境，并且公然声称进行侵略性的间谍飞行是美国政府的既定政策。不仅如此，美国政府悍然不顾苏联政府的严正抗议和合理要求，拒绝对自己的罪行承担责任，拒绝作出不再重犯的应有保证，使举世渴望的大国首脑会议无法举行。这就彻底揭露了美国帝国主义的蛮横面目。美国同意举行大国首脑会议本来就是极其勉强的。在它伪装和平的同时，它从来没有停止疯狂的扩军备战活动，它为大国首脑会议制造了种种困难和障碍，并且不断地散布大国首脑会议注定失败的悲观空气。大国首脑会议终于被美国所破坏，决不是偶然的。现在，美国竟企图把破坏大国首脑会议的责任转嫁到苏联身上，这真是无耻到了极点。赫鲁晓夫同志代表苏联政府严正地声明：苏联坚决地主张和平共处，主张谈判，主张达成明智的、互相可以接受的协议；但是，任何人采取任何挑衅活动都不能吓倒苏联，都不能吓倒社会主义国家，要我们屈膝是不可能的；只有在平等的基础上，不进行威胁和讹诈，才可以同我们讲话和谈判，而且必须要这样。这是伟大的苏联人民的声音，也代表了整个社会主义阵营的立场。中国政府和中国人民坚决支持苏联政府最近对美国帝国主义的挑衅罪行所采取的一系列的严正措施。六亿五千万中国人民将继续同伟大的苏联人民，同所有社会主义国家的人民，同全世界一切爱好和平的人民，紧紧地团结在一起，坚持不懈地为和缓国际紧张局势、争取世界持久和平而努力。我们要正告美国政府：用帝国主义的态度对待我们是不行的，不要把社会主义国家的和平努力看成是软弱的表现；对任何一个社会主义国家的侵犯，就是对中国的侵犯，就是对整个社会主义阵营的侵犯，都一定要遭到毁灭性的还击。
    中国人民对于阿尔及利亚人民怀有特别亲切的感情。共同的历史遭遇和共同反对帝国主义的斗争把我们两国人民紧密地连结在一起。中国人民从自己的切身经验中体会到，人民的力量是无穷无尽的，而帝国主义只不过是一只纸老虎。阿尔及利亚人民的斗争决不是孤立的，反对你们的只不过是一小撮帝国主义分子，坚定地站在你们一边的是亿万的亚非人民和全世界一切爱好和平和主持正义的人民。人民是决定的因素。阿尔及利亚人民依靠自己的团结和斗争，并且在世界各国人民的同情和支持下，一定能够经过长期的艰巨斗争，最后战胜帝国主义，赢得自己的独立和自由。
    尊敬的克里姆·贝勒卡塞姆副总理阁下，在这临别的前夕，请允许我代表中国政府和人民，对你们加强中阿友谊的真诚努力，表示衷心的感谢，并且请你们告诉广大的阿尔及利亚人民，我们六亿五千万中国人民将永远站在反对帝国主义、争取民族独立的英雄的阿尔及利亚人民这一边。
    我提议：
    为阿尔及利亚人民民族独立斗争的胜利，
    为中阿两国人民的友谊，
    为亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲民族民主运动的胜利，
    为亚非团结和友好合作，
    为亚非和世界的和平，
    为阿巴斯总理的健康，
    为克里姆·贝勒卡塞姆副总理阁下和阿尔及利亚贵宾们的健康，
    干杯！
