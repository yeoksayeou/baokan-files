Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, May 22nd: 300,000 people from all walks of life in Fuzhou, the capital of Fujian Province, held a rally and demonstration march in the rain today to support the Soviet Union's just stand against American imperialist aggression and to condemn the crimes of American imperialism in sabotaging the Four-Power Summit Conference.

This morning, the people of Fuzhou, holding high various placards and shouting slogans, braved the rain and poured into various venues from all directions. The masses participating in the rally and demonstration included workers, peasants, government cadres, students, People's Liberation Army soldiers, returned overseas Chinese, and fully armed militia.

Ye Fei, First Secretary of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, began to speak amidst the angry shouts of the masses against American imperialist aggression against the Soviet Union. He said: American imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of peace-loving people all over the world and the sworn enemy of the Chinese people. It still occupies our territory of Taiwan and has repeatedly violated our territorial waters and airspace. This is something the Chinese people will never allow, and the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan. He said: Only by thoroughly thwarting the war plots of American imperialism and tearing off its mask of false peace, only by uniting the people of the world to overthrow American imperialism, can world peace be guaranteed. We love peace, but if the imperialist bloc headed by the United States and the new war instigator Eisenhower dare to stir up trouble, the peace-loving people of the world will surely unite and wipe them out from the earth.

After the meeting, the angry masses held a demonstration march. Lin Guoqin, a demobilized soldier, a worker at the Fuzhou Machine Tool Factory, and the militia battalion commander, who had won four Third-Class Merits in the battle to eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek troops fully equipped with American weaponry on Dongshan Island, led the entire battalion of fully armed militia to participate in the demonstration today. He said: The ferocious American imperialism has never stopped its aggression and provocations against our country. Now it has sent military aircraft to invade the Soviet Union and sabotage the Four-Power Summit Conference. This proves that American imperialism is the number one enemy of world peace. If it dares to launch a war, the people of socialist countries and the peace-loving people of the world must wipe it out from the earth. Li Desheng, a major from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army who participated in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, said: Any aggression by American imperialism against our great ally, the Soviet Union, is aggression against our country, and we firmly disapprove of it. Wen Shaowu, a Taiwanese Gaoshan compatriot and sports worker living in Fujian, said angrily: American imperialism still occupies our beloved hometown of Taiwan, and my parents, brothers, and sisters are still in dire straits. We must resolutely unite with the peace-loving people of the world to drive American imperialism from our territory of Taiwan, from Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and drive them all back to their homeland.

Xiamen, Fujian Province, located on the forefront of coastal defense, held mass rallies in eighteen districts on the evening of the 21st, supporting the Soviet Union's just stand against American imperialist aggression. From the coastal defense frontline to the urban area, from the steel furnace to the construction site, there were angry crowds everywhere. The model militia heroes who supported the frontline in the 1958 bombardment of Jinmen: the "Ten Sisters" on the frontline, the "Thirteen Heroes," and the "Eighteen Good Men," all enthusiastically participated in the rally, holding high the guns in their hands and shouting slogans such as "Down with American imperialism!"

The three services of the People's Liberation Army on the Fujian Frontline also participated in the rally together with the people of the city. They unanimously expressed their determination to better prepare for war and training, and resolutely defend the socialist construction of the motherland and world peace.

Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, May 22nd: 35,000 people from all walks of life in Lhasa held an unprecedented large-scale demonstration and rally on the 21st, resolutely supporting the Soviet government's stern position on the American imperialist crime of aggression and strongly condemning American imperialism for sabotaging the Four-Power Summit Conference.

Yesterday, the ancient city of Lhasa was seething with excitement, and people poured out of the city and flocked to the Lhasa Stadium. The elderly, leaning on crutches, and housewives holding children came to participate in the meeting. Lamas in robes also carried placards to attend the meeting. The officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Lhasa also came to the venue with majestic strides.

The Acting Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, Panchen Erdeni, participated in the meeting. Also participating in the meeting were Tan Guansan, Deputy Secretary of the Tibet Working Committee of the Communist Party of China and Political Commissar of the Tibet Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, Zhou Renshan, Deputy Secretary of the Tibet Working Committee of the Communist Party of China, Guo Xilan, and other party and government leaders.

After the meeting began, Zhang Guohua, Deputy Secretary of the Tibet Working Committee of the Communist Party of China and Commander of the Tibet Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, spoke first. He said: We, the people of Tibet, like the people of the whole country, resolutely oppose American imperialism's aggression and provocation against the Soviet Union, resolutely oppose American imperialism's sabotage of the Four-Power Summit Conference, and fully support Comrade Khrushchev's solemn statement and just struggle at the preliminary meeting of the Four-Power Summit Conference. Zhang Guohua sternly warned that any act of aggression by American imperialism would be duly punished and would be met with doubled retaliation. At this time, the meeting place was surging with anger and indignation, and people raised their arms and shouted: "Support the Soviet government's solemn position on American imperialist aggression!" "Oppose American imperialism's sabotage of the Four-Power Summit Conference!" "People of the world unite and overthrow American imperialism!" Tibetan cadres, workers, peasants, citizens, and lamas waved flags and constantly shouted in Tibetan: "American imperialism 'Pa Zu' (get out)!" "American imperialism is the world's 'Zha Wu' (enemy)!"

Xuekang Tudeng Nima, Deputy Secretary of the Tibet Working Committee of the Communist Youth League, spoke at the meeting on behalf of the youth, women, and workers of Tibet, expressing firm support for the Soviet Union's solemn position on American imperialist aggression.

Jiang Erdamba, a farmer from the eastern suburbs of Lhasa, and Jiacuo Lin Living Buddha, Vice President of the Tibetan Branch of the Buddhist Association of China, also spoke at the meeting.
