    Launch Mass Movements, All Through Experimentation:
    North Guan Elementary School Achieves Remarkable Results in Teaching Reform

    (Our reporter Ma Qizhi, Lai Denong reports) Liaoning Province, Heishan County, since 1958, has been conducting teaching reform pilot programs at North Guan Elementary School, creating experiences for achieving more, faster, better, and more economical teaching. Due to a series of fundamental reform measures, first-grade students, after three semesters and one month of study, are now at the level of the fifth semester in arithmetic and the eighth semester in language.

    Recently, the Heishan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened an on-site meeting on teaching reform in Heishan County. Zhang Panshi, Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Dong Chuncai, Vice Minister of Education, attended the meeting. In addition to the heads of education administrative departments and schools, and outstanding teachers from various cities and counties within Liaoning Province, education departments and schools from many provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country also sent people to visit.

    In the Great Leap Forward of 1958, the Heishan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in order to oppose the slow, inefficient, and costly phenomena in education work, launched a high tide of teaching reform and selected North Guan Elementary School as a pilot. They conducted in-depth investigations and research into children's intellectual development and life experiences, learning that three- and four-year-olds had already learned common household language; kindergarten children could quickly learn the pronunciation of the four tones and could count numbers within one hundred; and newly enrolled children already had relatively rich life knowledge and had some understanding of the sounds and meanings of some characters and words. Based on these circumstances, they believed that the current elementary school curriculum content greatly lagged behind children's ability to accept knowledge. At the same time, they believed that the most important issue in language teaching was literacy teaching. If too few new characters were learned too slowly, it would not only affect literacy teaching but also hinder the development of children's reading and writing. Therefore, they decided to conduct "concentrated literacy" experiments in the first grade, organizing teachers to compile a complete set of methods, such as picture-based literacy textbooks, song-based character substitution, and phonetic categorization of characters. As a result, three hundred and seventeen new characters were taught in ten class hours. After on-the-spot acceptance by county committee leaders, teachers, students, and more than two hundred parents, an average of two hundred and seventy-six characters were recognized, which was fifty-three more than the two hundred and twenty-three characters in the original first-grade textbook; then, reading experiments were conducted, and the half-year reading course was completed in ten lessons; later, bold experiments were carried out in writing teaching, which was originally conducted in the third grade. Inspired by the language teaching reform, fourth-grade teachers also adopted methods such as knowledge classification, intensive key learning, and step-by-step learning, practicing, and application, to conduct arithmetic teaching reform experiments, completing a semester's teaching tasks in ten class hours, achieving remarkable results. On this basis, the entire school immediately launched a fundamental teaching reform movement to comprehensively review knowledge quality, compile new teaching materials, and formulate teaching reform plans.

    At first, some people suspected that this was a "duck being forced onto the stove," learning quickly but forgetting quickly too. Last November, with the help of a working group from the Institute of Psychology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, North Guan Elementary School conducted research and summarization, and further proved that the new teaching materials could inspire students' thinking, so they learned quickly and well. The old teaching materials, on the other hand, were fragmented, repetitive, cumbersome, and disorganized, causing excessive burden on students. The Liaoning Provincial Department of Education working group also conducted a comparative test between the pilot class of North Guan Elementary School (now the second grade, first class) after three semesters and one month of study and the regular fourth-grade class of Houchun Elementary School in Xinmin County. The two classes used the same test questions, test time, and grading standards. The results of the arithmetic comparison test showed that the average score of the fourth-grade students of Houchun Elementary School was 90.2, while the average score of the pilot class of North Guan Elementary School reached 96.6, with more than half of the students getting full marks and no student failing. The vast majority of students in the pilot class of North Guan Elementary School could compile application problems by themselves in combination with production labor and practical life. Not only were the calculations accurate, but also the speed was very fast, and some students completed all the test questions in only fifteen minutes. In terms of language, the students in the pilot class of North Guan Elementary School had already exceeded the level of the regular fourth-grade class. The average number of characters recognized by the students in the pilot class was one thousand seven hundred and fifteen, accounting for 91.7% of the total number of characters in the test, while the average number of characters recognized by the regular fourth-grade students in Houchun Elementary School was one thousand four hundred and twenty-seven, accounting for 76.5% of the total number of characters in the test. In the dictation test of one hundred and fifty new characters, the students in the pilot class of North Guan Elementary School could write an average of one hundred and forty-one, accounting for 94% of the total number of characters in the dictation; the regular fourth-grade students in Houchun Elementary School could write an average of ninety-three, accounting for 62% of the total number of characters in the dictation. In addition, in the tests of reading, word explanation, and composition, the reading speed, fluency, ability to retell the main idea of the text, and ability to explain words of the students in the pilot class of North Guan Elementary School exceeded those of the regular fourth-grade class in Houchun Elementary School. The students in the pilot class of North Guan Elementary School can now independently read seven or eight kinds of children's publications suitable for fourth, fifth, and sixth grade students, such as "Red Children" and "New Youth Daily." They can write diaries, letters, poems, and film and drama reviews. Liu Yin, a seven-year-old student, has written two hundred and sixty-eight diaries from the second semester of the first grade to the present. Because they learn more and learn more deeply, children receive more education, and therefore communist morality grows quickly. In one semester, good deeds appeared four hundred and forty-two times. After health checks, the students are in good health, full of energy and vitality, and the attendance rate is above 98%.

    The achievements and experiences of the teaching reform at North Guan Elementary School have been achieved under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, strengthening the leadership of the Party, launching mass movements, promoting the spirit of collaboration, and breaking through the shackles of bourgeois educational thought. The valuable aspects of this experience are manifested in: First, they conducted a series of investigations and researches in the teaching reform, and on the basis of proceeding from reality, boldly carried out fundamental reforms in teaching content and teaching methods, adhering to the principle of all through experimentation. Second, they developed children's ability to accept knowledge, actively guided their progress, taught both knowledge and learning methods, constantly inspired students' consciousness, initiative, and improved their thinking ability, thoroughly changed the past "cramming" teaching methods, and broke the metaphysical view of bourgeois education that regarded children's intelligence as static and unchanging. Third, their teaching reform is a comprehensive leap forward, with students of upper, middle, and lower levels comprehensively improving, and intellectual, moral, and physical education also comprehensively developing. This is completely different from bourgeois scholars who advocate "genius theory" and only teach good geniuses. (Attached picture)

    大搞群众运动　一切经过试验
    北关小学教学改革卓有成效
    本报讯　记者马启智、赖德浓报道：辽宁省黑山县从1958年在北关小学进行教学改革试点，创造了多快好省的进行教学的经验。由于采取了一系列的根本改革措施，一年级学生经过三个学期零一个月的学习，现在算术课已相当于第五学期的程度，语文课已相当于第八学期的程度。
    最近，中共辽宁省委在黑山县召开了教学改革现场会议，中共中央宣传部副部长张盘石和教育部副部长董纯才出席了会议。出席会议的，除辽宁省内各市、县教育行政部门、学校负责人和优秀教师外，还有全国许多省、市、自治区的教育部门和学校都派人前来参观。
    中共黑山县委在1958年大跃进中，为反对教育工作中的少慢差费的现象，掀起了一个大闹教学改革的高潮，并选定北关小学作试点。他们对儿童的智力发展和生活经验进行了深入的调查研究，了解到三、四岁的孩子已学会家庭一般用语；幼儿园的孩子能很快地学会四声的发音，并且能数一百以内的数字；刚入学的儿童的生活知识已比较丰富，有些字、词的音义已有所了解。根据这些情况，他们认为现行小学课程内容，大大落后于儿童接受知识的能力；同时，认为语文教学的最重要问题是识字教学，如果生字学的太少太慢，不但影响识字教学，并且阻碍儿童阅读、写作的开展。因此，确定在一年级进行“集中识字”的实验工作，组织教师编写看图识字、以歌代字、同音归类的识字课本等一整套办法。结果用十个课时教了三百一十七个生字，经县委领导同志和教师，学生、家长二百多人当堂验收，平均识字二百七十六个，比原有一年级第一册课本二百二十三个生字还多五十三个；接着，又进行了阅读实验，用十节课教完了半年阅读的课程；后来，又大胆地开设了原来三年级才进行的写作教学实验。在语文教学改革的启示下，四年级教师又采取知识归类、猛攻关键，学、练、用分步走的办法，进行了算术教学改革的试验，用十个课时完成了一个学期的教学任务，取得显著效果。在这个基础上，全校立刻掀起普查知识质量，编写新教材，制订教学改革规划的根本性教学改革运动。
    开始时，有人怀疑这是“鸭子上锅台一猛之劲”，学得快、忘的也快。去年11月北关小学在中国科学院心理研究所工作组的帮助下，进行研究总结，并且进一步证明新教材能启发学生思维，因此，学得快、学得好。而旧教材零碎、重复、繁琐、体系混乱造成学生负担过重。辽宁省教育厅工作组又把北关小学经过三学期零一个月学习的试点班（现在的二年级一班）和新民县后街小学四年级普通班的学生进行了对比测验，两个班用相同的测验题目、测验时间和评卷标准，算术对比测验的结果，后街小学四年级学生平均成绩90.2分，北关小学试点班学生平均成绩达96.6分，得满分的占一半以上，没有一个不及格的学生；北关小学试点班绝大多数学生都能结合生产劳动和生活实际自编应用题，不仅计算准确，而且速度很快，有的仅用十五分钟就全部答完了试题。语文科方面，北关小学试点班学生已经超过了四年级普通班的水平，试点班学生平均识字一千七百一十五个，占测验总字数的91.7％，后街小学四年级普通班学生平均识字一千四百二十七个，占测验总字数的76.5％。听写测验生字一百五十个，北关小学试点班学生平均会写一百四十一个，占听写总字数的94％；后街小学四年级普通班学生平均会写九十三个，占听写总字数的62％。此外，在阅读、解词和作文的测验上，北关小学试点班学生的阅读速度、流利程度、复述课文大意和解词的能力都超过了后街小学四年级普通班。北关小学试点班学生，现在已能独立阅读适合四、五、六年级学生阅读的“红孩子”、“新少年报”等七、八种儿童读物。他们会写日记、书信、诗歌，以及影剧观后感。七岁的学生刘音从一年级下学期到现在已写了二百六十八篇日记。由于学得多、学得深，儿童受的教育也就多了，因而共产主义品德成长得很快。在一个学期中，好人好事出现四百四十二人次。经过健康检查，学生的身体很好，精神饱满活泼，出席率在98％以上。
    北关小学教学改革取得的成绩和经验，是在毛泽东思想指导下，加强党的领导，大搞群众运动，大兴协作之风，冲破了资产阶级教育思想束缚而取得的。这个经验可贵的地方，表现在：一，他们在教学改革中进行了一系列的调查研究，在从实际出发的基础上，本着一切经过试验的原则，大胆地进行教学内容、教学方法的根本改革。二，他们发挥儿童接受知识的能力，积极诱导其向前发展，既教知识又教学习方法，不断启发学生的自觉性、主动性和提高思维能力，彻底地改变了过去“填鸭”式的教学方法，打破了资产阶级教育学把儿童智力看作静止不变的形而上学观点，三，他们的教学改革是全面跃进，上、中、下程度的学生都全面提高，智育、德育、体育也都全面发展。与主张“天才论”专教好天才的资产阶级学者完全不同。（附图片）
