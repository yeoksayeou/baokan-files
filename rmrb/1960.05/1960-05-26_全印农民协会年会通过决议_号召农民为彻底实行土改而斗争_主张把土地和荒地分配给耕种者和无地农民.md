    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 23rd: The 17th Annual Meeting of the All India Kisan Sabha, held in Ghazipur, Uttar Pradesh, India, concluded on May 20th. The meeting demanded the thorough implementation of land reform and called on peasants to launch a struggle for this purpose.

    The meeting concluded with a mass rally attended by approximately six thousand peasants.

    On the same day, prior to the mass rally, two thousand peasants marched in the scorching heat, carrying banners and flags. They shouted the following slogans: Distribute wasteland to landless peasants, stipulate a reasonable upper limit on land ownership, distribute land to cultivators, and immediately approve the Land Relations Bill passed by the former Kerala Legislative Assembly.

    It is reported that A.K. Gopalan, who was re-elected as President of the All India Kisan Sabha at this meeting, called for strengthening the peasant association as a mass organization and emphasized the importance of meeting the legitimate demands of the peasants. He also called on the peasants to launch a struggle against the ineffective and flawed land bills passed by the Congress Party governments in various states.

    Prior to this, approximately four hundred peasant representatives from various states unanimously adopted several resolutions after three days of discussions (from the 17th to the 19th).

    The resolution on the progress of land reform, passed by the meeting, called on all Indian peasants and agricultural workers to organize in order to launch a powerful movement to strive for the thorough implementation of land reform and to oppose the pro-landlord and anti-peasant policies pursued by the various state governments.

    The resolution expressed regret over the current agricultural situation in India and pointed out all the loopholes in the land laws of the various states. The resolution cited official reports showing that in some states, the number of peasants deprived of land had reached over 50% of the total number of peasants in a short period.

    The resolution on the agricultural aspects of India's Third Five-Year Plan (April 1961 – March 1966), passed by the meeting, expressed concern about the extremely low rate of agricultural production and attributed this to "outdated agricultural relations" and "the concentration of land ownership." The resolution pointed out that approximately one-third of the arable land belongs to landowners who own more than twenty-five acres per household, and they account for 4% of the total number of landowners.

    During the meeting, progressive Indian poets and cultural workers held performances for the attending peasants. These performances reflected the peasants' arduous lives, their struggles, their demands, and the path to realizing these demands.

    (Note: Although the Indian government has stated that it wants to implement land reform to increase agricultural production and improve the lives of peasants, the policies actually implemented by the state governments support the feudal system. The draft resolution on the current situation, recently passed by the Central Executive Committee of the Communist Party of India, pointed out: "No serious provisions have been made to limit the amount of land owned by landlords; the phenomenon of evicting tenants has not stopped; evicted tenants have not regained their land; land has not been given to landless or impoverished peasants... The control of rural economy by big landlords, moneylenders, and unscrupulous merchants has gradually strengthened, resulting in greater poverty for the vast majority of poor peasants and agricultural laborers.")

### 全印农民协会年会通过决议  号召农民为彻底实行土改而斗争  主张把土地和荒地分配给耕种者和无地农民

    全印农民协会年会通过决议
    号召农民为彻底实行土改而斗争
    主张把土地和荒地分配给耕种者和无地农民
    新华社新德里23日电　在印度北方邦加齐普尔举行的全印农民协会第十七次年会在5月20日结束。会议要求实行彻底的土地改革，并且号召发动农民为此而展开斗争。
    会议结束时举行了约有六千名农民参加的群众大会。
    同一天，在举行群众大会以前，两千名农民高举标语牌和旗帜冒着酷热举行了游行。他们高呼下列口号：把荒地分配给无地的农民，规定占有土地的合理的最高限额，把土地分配给耕种者，立即批准前喀拉拉邦立法会议通过的土地关系法案。
    据报道，在这次会议中重新当选为全印农民协会主席的阿·库·高普兰号召加强农民协会这一群众性组织，他强调满足农民的正当要求的重要性。他还号召农民展开斗争，反对各邦国大党政府所通过的、不会发生效果的、有缺点的土地法案。
    在这以前，来自各邦的四百名左右的农民代表在进行了三天（从17日到19日）的讨论之后一致通过了几项决议。
    会议通过的关于土地改革进展的决议，号召所有的印度农民和农业工人组织起来，以便展开强大的运动，争取实行彻底的土地改革，反对各邦政府所奉行的支持地主和反对农民的政策。
    决议对印度目前的农业情况表示遗憾，并指出各邦土地法律中的一切漏洞。这项决议援引官方的报告说明，在某些邦内，被剥夺土地的农民在短时期内已达农民总数的50％以上。
    会议通过的关于印度第三个五年计划（1961年4月—1966年3月）的农业方面的决议对农业生产的极低的生产速度表示忧虑，并认为造成这种情况的原因是“过时的农业关系”和“地权的集中”。决议指出，大约三分之一的耕地是属于每户拥有二十五英亩以上的土地所有者，他们占土地所有者人数的4％。
    在会议期间，印度的进步诗人和文化工作者为到会农民举行了表演。这些表演反映了农民的艰苦生活以及他们的斗争、要求和实现这些要求的道路。
    （按：尽管印度政府曾经表示要实行土地改革来提高农业生产和改善农民生活，但是各邦政府实际执行的却是支持封建制度的政策。印度共产党中央执行委员会不久前通过的关于目前形势的决议草案中曾经指出：“并没有认真地规定地主占有土地的适当的限额，夺佃的现象没有停止，被剥夺土地的佃农并没有重新得到他们的土地；土地并没有给予无地或贫困的农民。……大地主、放债者和奸商对农村经济的控制逐步加强了，结果使广大的贫农和农业劳动者更加贫困。”）
