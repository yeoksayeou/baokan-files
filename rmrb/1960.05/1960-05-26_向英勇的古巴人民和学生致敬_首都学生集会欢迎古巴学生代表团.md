Xinhua News Agency, May 25th: More than 1,500 students in the capital gathered at Tsinghua University tonight to welcome the Cuban student delegation led by Luis Soto Andrade, Deputy Secretary-General of the Cuban University Students Federation.

Hu Qili, Chairman of the All-China Students' Federation, and others attended the welcoming meeting. When the members of the delegation were introduced to the students of the capital one by one, warm applause erupted in the venue.

Zhang Bingguang, Chairman of the Beijing Students' Federation, spoke at the meeting. On behalf of the 120,000 university students in Beijing, he warmly welcomed the Cuban student delegation from the forefront of the Latin American struggle against US imperialism, and extended brotherly greetings and respect to the heroic Cuban people and students. He told the Cuban youth friends that the people and students of China and Cuba stand on the same battle line against imperialism. He said that the Chinese people deeply admire the heroic struggle of the Cuban people and cheer for every victory of the Cuban people's struggle.

Luis Soto Andrade first extended cordial respect to the Chinese youth in his speech. After describing the achievements of the Cuban revolution and the threats of US imperialism to the Cuban people, he said: The Cuban people are not isolated; the people of the world, the brothers of Latin America, and the Chinese people are all supporting Cuba. He said: They support us because our struggle is just; they support us because they have also suffered and are suffering from imperialist oppression. Imperialism is the common enemy of the people of the world, the enemy of human progress, the enemy of peace and friendship between all peoples.

He finally shouted, "Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Cuban people!"

After the meeting, Tsinghua University students sang "Militia Chorus" and screened a Cuban film.

    向英勇的古巴人民和学生致敬
    首都学生集会欢迎古巴学生代表团
    据新华社25日讯　首都学生一千五百多人，今晚在清华大学集会，欢迎以古巴大学生联合会副总书记路易斯·索托·安得拉加为首的古巴学生代表团。
    中华全国学生联合会主席胡启立等人出席了欢迎大会。当代表团成员被一一介绍给首都学生的时候，会场上爆发出热烈的掌声。
    北京市学生联合会主席张炳光在大会上讲话。他代表北京十二万大学生热烈欢迎来自拉丁美洲反对美帝国主义斗争前哨的古巴学生代表团，并且向英勇的古巴人民和学生致兄弟般的问候和敬意。他向古巴青年朋友表示：中国、古巴两国人民和学生站在反对帝国主义的一条战线上。他说，中国人民十分敬佩古巴人民的英勇斗争，并为古巴人民斗争的每一个胜利而欢呼。
    路易斯·索托·安得拉加在讲话中首先向中国青年致亲切敬意。他在叙述了古巴革命取得的成就和美帝国主义对古巴人民的威胁以后说：古巴人民不是孤立的，全世界人民、拉丁美洲的兄弟以及中国人民，都在支持古巴。他说：他们支持我们，因为我们的斗争是正义的；他们支持我们，因为他们也曾遭受过和正在遭受着帝国主义的压迫。帝国主义是世界人民的共同敌人，人类进步的敌人，和平和各国人民友谊的敌人。
    他最后高呼中国古巴人民友谊万岁。
    会后，清华大学学生演唱了“民兵大合唱”，放映了古巴电影。
