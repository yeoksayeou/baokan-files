Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, May 13th: Today, in Nanjing, the city that suffered the bloody massacre by Japanese imperialist invaders in 1937, 400,000 people held a mass rally and demonstration in support of the Japanese people's opposition to the US-Japan military alliance treaty and against the US-Japan reactionaries' plot for new war conspiracies.

When Japanese imperialists occupied Nanjing at the end of 1937, Japanese fascist troops, under the command of war criminal Tani Hisao, carried out an inhuman massacre of Nanjing residents. Japanese troops even engaged in "killing contests" for amusement. According to investigations by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, more than 190,000 Chinese soldiers and civilians were collectively shot and buried alive. In addition, the corpses of over 150,000 residents killed separately were collected for burial. In total, over 300,000 of our compatriots were brutally murdered by Japanese fascists, becoming a world-shaking event at the time.

The people of Nanjing, who have a blood feud with Japanese fascists, held a city-wide demonstration today. The central Xinjiekou Square was packed with angry crowds, holding countless banners and waving their fists, shouting slogans such as "Oppose the revival of Japanese militarism!" "The people of China and Japan unite to overthrow US imperialism!" The members of the Zijinshan People's Commune in the suburbs, standing in the farmers' ranks on the east side of the square, will never forget the heinous crimes committed by Japanese and US aggressors in their hometown. Twenty-three years ago, in the winter, the inhuman Japanese fascist troops had engaged in "killing contests" on Zijinshan Mountain. Twelve years ago, in the summer, American bandits also drowned three young farmers innocently here, creating the famous "Zhonghe Bridge" incident. When they heard that Japanese and US imperialism are now colluding to conspire to launch a new war, people's anger reached its peak. Xie Xiuzhen and Zhao Guangchao, members of the Xiaolingwei Brigade, accused the Japanese invaders of the bloody crimes of murdering their fathers and wives. They said: The blood debts owed to us by the Japanese devils have not been repaid, and US imperialism wants to hand them the butcher knife stained with the blood of the Chinese people. We firmly disagree.

The mass rally at Xinjiekou Square began at 3:00 PM. Those who participated in the mass rally included Liu Shunyuan, Secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China; Peng Chong, Alternate Secretary of the Provincial Committee and First Secretary of the Nanjing Municipal Committee; Guan Wenwei, Chen Shutong, and Wu Yifang, Vice Governors of Jiangsu Province; Chen Yang, Secretary of the Nanjing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Mayor of Nanjing; Lieutenant General Liu Haotian, Major General Long Fucai, and Major General Lei Yongtong, leaders of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Nanjing; as well as the heads of various democratic parties and mass organizations in the province and city.

Peng Chong, Alternate Secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and First Secretary of the Nanjing Municipal Committee, spoke at the rally. He solemnly announced at the meeting that the people of Jiangsu Province and Nanjing City express their great anger and strong condemnation of the US-Japan military alliance treaty, which seriously threatens peace in Asia and the world. We express our sincere respect and full support for the Japanese people who are persevering and unyieldingly carrying out their heroic struggle. Peng Chong said: "This aggressive US-Japan military alliance treaty is absolutely unacceptable to the Chinese people, as well as to the people of Asia and the Japanese people. The signing of the US-Japan military alliance treaty has once again exposed the hideous face of US imperialism, which pretends to be for peace but is actually preparing for war, making it increasingly clear to the people of the world that US imperialism, which actively supports West Germany in the West and Japanese militarism in the East, is the most ferocious enemy of world peace and the people." Peng Chong concluded by saying: We, the people of Nanjing, suffered an inhuman massacre by Japanese militarists twenty-three years ago, with hundreds of thousands of people dying unnatural deaths. During the Japanese militarists' invasion of our country, Nanjing was used as its criminal command center, bringing extremely profound disasters to the people of Nanjing. We, the people of Nanjing, the people of Jiangsu, and the people of the entire country and the world who love peace, will absolutely not allow Japanese militarists under US support to stage a comeback. Peng Chong's speech constantly aroused thunderous applause and slogans from hundreds of thousands of people in the square. Subsequently, representatives of various democratic parties, people's organizations, workers, farmers, and students spoke in succession.

Many districts of Nanjing also held mass rallies today. More than 10,000 people held a mass rally in the square of the Yuhuatai Revolutionary Martyrs Cemetery, famous at home and abroad. Many people excitedly jumped onto the stage to accuse the Japanese militarists of the crimes of massacring the Chinese people.

In the areas of Caoxie Gorge, Meitangang, Yijiangmen, and other areas of Nanjing's Mufu Mountain, which suffered the most from the Japanese fascist massacre, the masses who participated in the rallies and demonstrations today accused the Japanese invaders of their atrocities in those years. Cui Shengfu, a 63-year-old resident of the Xiaguan District, was a victim who was shot twice during the massacre carried out by the Japanese invading army in Meitangang in 1937 and escaped from the pile of corpses. He said angrily: We, the people of Nanjing, can never forget the blood debts owed by the Japanese invaders, and we must never let US imperialism rearm Japan.

    绝不容许日本军国主义者在美国扶植下卷土重来  
    南京四十万人大示威
    据新华社南京13日电　在1937年曾惨遭日本帝国主义侵略者血腥大屠杀的南京市，今天有四十万人举行支援日本人民反对美日军事同盟条约、反对美日反动派策划新战争阴谋的群众大会和大示威。
    1937年底日本帝国主义侵占南京时，日本法西斯军队在战争罪犯谷寿夫指挥下，对南京居民进行了灭绝人性的大屠杀，日本军队甚至进行
  “杀人比赛”取乐。据后来远东国际军事法庭调查证明，我国军民被集体枪杀和活埋的有十九万多人，此外，另散被杀的居民仅收埋的尸体就有十五万多具，总计我国同胞惨遭日本法西斯杀害的在三十万人以上，成为当时震动世界的事件。
    对日本法西斯有着血海深仇的南京市人民今天举行了倾城的大示威。在市中心的新街口广场上挤满了愤怒的群众，人们举着数不清的标语，挥舞着拳头高呼“反对复活日本军国主义！”
  “中日两国人民团结起来，打倒美帝国主义！”等口号。站在广场东面农民队伍里的郊区紫金山人民公社的社员们，对日美侵略者在他们的家乡犯下的滔天罪行是永远不会忘记的。二十三年前的冬天，惨无人道的日本法西斯军队曾在这里的紫金山上干过“杀人比赛”。十二年前的夏天，美国强盗也曾在这里无辜淹死了三个青年农民，制造了有名的“中和桥”事件。当他们听到日美帝国主义现在又勾结起来阴谋发动新的战争时，人们的愤怒情绪达到了极点。孝灵卫大队的社员谢秀珍和赵广潮向群众控诉了日寇杀害自己父亲和妻子的血腥罪行，他们说：日本鬼子欠下我们的血债未还，美帝国主义又想把沾满中国人民鲜血的屠刀交给他们，我们坚决不答应。
    新街口广场上的群众大会在下午三时举行。参加群众大会的有中共江苏省委书记刘顺元，省委候补书记、南京市委第一书记彭冲，江苏省副省长管文蔚、陈书同、吴贻芳，中共南京市委书记、南京市长陈扬，中国人民解放军驻南京部队首长刘浩天中将、龙福才少将、雷永通少将以及省、市各民主党派、各群众团体的负责人。
    中共江苏省委候补书记、南京市委第一书记彭冲在大会上讲了话。他在大会上庄严宣布：江苏全省和南京全市人民对严重地威胁着亚洲和世界和平的日美军事同盟条约，表示极大的愤怒和强烈的谴责。对正在再接再厉、不屈不挠地进行英勇斗争的日本人民，表示衷心的敬意和全力的支持。彭冲说：“这个侵略性的日美军事同盟条约是我们中国人民所绝对不能容许的，也是亚洲人民和日本人民所绝对不能容许的，日美军事同盟条约的签订，又一次暴露了美帝国主义假和平真备战的狰狞面貌，使全世界人民越来越清楚地认识到，在西方积极扶植西德，在东方积极扶植日本军国主义的美帝国主义，正是世界和平人民的最凶恶的敌人。”彭冲最后说：我们南京人民，二十三年前曾受到日本军国主义的惨无人道的大屠杀，有数十万人死于非命。日本军国主义侵略我国期间又曾以南京作为它的罪恶指挥中心，给南京人民带来的灾难极为深重，我们南京人民、江苏人民和全国、全世界爱好和平的人民一样，绝不容许在美国扶植下的日本军国主义者卷土重来。彭冲的讲话，不断激起广场上几十万群众狂风暴雨般的掌声和口号声。接着，各民主党派、各人民团体和工人、农民、学生的代表相继讲了话。
    南京市的许多地区今天也举行了群众大会。在中外闻名的雨花台革命烈士墓的广场上，今天有一万多人举行了群众大会。许多人激动地跳到台上控诉日本军国主义分子屠杀中国人民的罪行。
    遭受日本法西斯屠杀最惨重的南京幕府山草鞋峡、煤炭港、挹江门等地区，参加集会和示威的群众今天纷纷控诉了日本侵略者当年的暴行。下关区六十三岁的居民崔省福，就是1937年日本侵略军在煤炭港进行大屠杀时，身中两弹后从死尸堆中逃出来的受害者。他愤怒地说：我们南京人民再也忘不了日本侵略者欠下的血债，我们决不能再让美国帝国主义把日本重新武装起来。
