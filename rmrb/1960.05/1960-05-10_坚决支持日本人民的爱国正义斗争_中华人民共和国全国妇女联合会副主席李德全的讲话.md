Comrades, Friends!
　　The U.S.-Japanese reactionaries have concluded an aggressive military alliance treaty and are plotting new war conspiracies. We Chinese women and the people of the whole country express our resolute opposition to this. For more than a year, Japanese women and the Japanese people have been waging a tenacious struggle against this disastrous treaty imposed upon them. Starting today, they are holding the unprecedented Sixteenth Unified Action. On behalf of Chinese women, I extend my highest respect to them.
　　Chinese women and the Chinese people, as well as the people of Asian countries, have suffered from the scourge and bloody massacres of U.S. imperialism and Japanese militarism. These traumas are still fresh in our memories. Today, Japanese militarists are colluding with U.S. imperialism, plotting new war conspiracies, and have become a serious threat to the people of Asian countries. However, we want to warn the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries that times have changed. Today's China is not the China of twenty years ago. The Japanese people will never again allow Japanese militarists to do whatever they want, and Asia is no longer Asia to be slaughtered. The struggle against the barbaric rule of the U.S. and Syngman Rhee, ignited by the South Korean people like a volcanic eruption, and the tides of struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty launched by the Japanese people time and time again, are warnings to the U.S. imperialists and all their running dogs. If the U.S. imperialists and the Kishi Nobusuke government ignore these warnings from the Asian people and continue to play with war conspiracies, continuing to provoke the Asian people, they will certainly not have a better end than Syngman Rhee. The Chinese people and the Asian people will, like eliminating flies, rats, mosquitoes, and bedbugs, wipe them out completely.
　　Comrades, let us unite with the Japanese people and all the people of Asia to smash the war conspiracies of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and overthrow U.S. imperialism!

    坚决支持日本人民的爱国正义斗争
    中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会副主席李德全的讲话同志们，朋友们！
    日美反动派缔结了侵略性的军事同盟条约，策划新的战争阴谋，我们中国妇女和全国人民，对此表示坚决地反对。日本妇女和日本人民，一年多以来，一直在反对强加在他们头上的这项灾难性的条约，进行着顽强不屈的斗争，从今天起，他们又在举行规模空前的第十六次统一行动，我代表中国妇女，向他们致以崇高的敬意。
    中国妇女和中国人民以及亚洲各国人民，曾经遭受美帝国主义和日本军国主义的祸害，和血腥屠杀，这些创痛，记忆犹新。今天日本军国主义者和美帝国主义勾结起来，策划新的战争阴谋，又成了亚洲各国人民的严重威胁，但是我们要警告美日反动派，时代变了，今天的中国已不是二十年前的中国，日本人民也决不再允许日本军国主义者为所欲为，亚洲也不是任人宰割的亚洲了，南朝鲜人民像火山爆发一样所掀起的反对美、李野蛮统治的斗争，和日本人民掀起的一次又一次的反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争怒潮，就是对美帝国主义者和他的一切走狗们发出的警告，如果美帝国主义者和岸信介政府，不顾亚洲人民的这些警告，继续玩弄战争阴谋，一定要向亚洲人民挑衅的话，绝不会比李承晚有更好的下场，中国人民和亚洲人民定将和消灭苍蝇、老鼠、蚊子、臭虫一样，把它们消灭得一干二净。
    同志们，让我们同日本人民和全亚洲人民团结起来，粉碎美日反动派的战争阴谋，打倒美帝国主义！
