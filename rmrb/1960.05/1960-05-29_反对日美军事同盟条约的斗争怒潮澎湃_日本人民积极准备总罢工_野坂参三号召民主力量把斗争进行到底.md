Xinhua News Agency, May 28th, Tokyo dispatch: Following the victorious conclusion of the massive Sixteenth Unified Action on the 26th, the Japanese people continued their struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty in various forms yesterday and today, and are preparing for the general strike to be held on June 4th.

	Over the past two days, 2,000 people in Tokyo have participated in petitions demanding the dissolution of the Diet. Among the petitioners were civil servants from the Kishinobu government's Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, as well as teachers, telecommunications workers, university professors, actors, and students. They held demonstrations in front of Kishinobu's official residence and the Diet, shouting: "Dissolve the House of Representatives immediately!" "Kishinobu resign!" "The decision of the House of Representatives is invalid!"

	In addition to these petitioners, 400 representatives from the All-Japan Trade Union Conference went to the Diet today to submit petitions demanding the dissolution of the Diet. Yesterday, the All-Japan Trade Union Conference and the Democratic Socialist Party held a rally in Tokyo and passed a resolution demanding the resignation of the Kishinobu cabinet and the dissolution of the Diet. Today, 1,500 activists from the Socialist Party, Communist Party, General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, and the Tokyo Metropolitan Joint Struggle Council for the Defense of Peace and Democracy, rode in 50 trucks to almost every major factory and train station to call on workers to launch a general strike on June 4th. They also distributed leaflets to ordinary citizens, asking them to support the workers' general strike.

	Fifteen professors and associate professors from the Faculty of Science at Nagoya University issued a statement today demanding the resignation of the Kishinobu cabinet and the dissolution of the Diet. Among these fifteen people are theoretical physicist Shōichi Sakata and Kanekura Ariyama.

	According to a report in today's "Asahi Shimbun," professors and staff at Saitama University and Saitama Economic Junior College in Saitama Prefecture began collecting signatures on the 27th demanding the immediate dissolution of the Diet. On the 27th alone, 70 professors and approximately 100 staff members signed the signature book.

Xinhua News Agency, May 28th, Tokyo dispatch: Nozaka Sanzō, Chairman of the Japanese Communist Party, published a written statement in today's "Akahata" newspaper, calling on all JCP members and Japanese democratic forces to build on the brilliant achievements of the Sixteenth National Unified Action, strengthen their confidence in victory, and carry the struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty through to the end.

	Nozaka pointed out that the Sixteenth National Unified Action was the largest since the beginning of the struggle to prevent the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and not only conducted unprecedented petitions to the Diet, but also victoriously organized the masses to launch protest struggles against the two enemies of the Japanese people—U.S. imperialism and the Kishinobu cabinet.

	Nozaka pointed out that the protest actions directed at the Prime Minister's official residence and the U.S. Embassy were a concentrated expression of the indignant sentiments of the broad masses of the Japanese people.

	Nozaka accused Kishinobu of shamelessly trying to force his way through, regardless of the rising tide of opposition from the Japanese people. He said that the Japanese people must absolutely not allow Kishinobu's conspiracy to succeed.

	Nozaka called on all JCP members and democratic forces to further consolidate and promote the achievements of the Sixteenth National Unified Action, and to fully organize protest movements against the U.S. and Japanese governments, and to struggle to prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty," force the dissolution of the Diet, and drive the Kishinobu cabinet from power.

	Nozaka emphasized that it is currently necessary to do everything possible to victoriously organize workers to launch a nationwide strike on June 4th and to complete the collection of 27 million signatures (half of the total number of people with the right to vote in the general election) as soon as possible.

Xinhua News Agency, May 27th, Tokyo dispatch: Eighteen hundred workers from Kyodo Printing, one of Tokyo's largest printing plants, and more than 700 metalworkers and bookbinders nearby, held a demonstration march on the street for an hour and a half on the afternoon of the 26th, protesting Kishinobu's illegal and forceful "passage" of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" in the House of Representatives, demanding the immediate resignation of the Kishinobu cabinet and the dissolution of the Diet.

	Prior to this, the Kyodo Printing Union conducted a general vote, and the vast majority of workers expressed their support for holding a strike to prevent the ratification of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

	The All-Japan Printing and Publishing Workers' Union Federation distributed many leaflets at the Kyodo Printing factory yesterday morning. The grassroots organizations of the JCP and the Socialist Party in this union also jointly distributed leaflets, calling on workers to rise up and launch a political strike.

    新华社28日讯　东京消息：日本人民在26日胜利地结束声势浩大的第十六次统一行动之后，昨天和今天继续以各种形式进行反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争，并且为6月4日举行的总罢工进行准备。
    在这两天里，东京共有两千人参加了请愿，要求解散国会。请愿者中有岸信介政府农林省和东京都政府的公务人员以及教员、电讯工人、大学教授、演员和学生。他们在岸信介官邸和国会前面举行了示威，高呼：“立即解散众议院！”“岸信介辞职！”“众议院的决定是无效的！”
    除了这些请愿者以外，全日本工会会议的四百名代表在今天到国会去递交了请愿书，要求解散国会。昨天，全日本工会会议和民主社会党曾在东京举行集会，通过了要求岸信介内阁下台和解散国会的决议。今天，还有社会党、共产党、日本工会总评议会和东京都维护和平与民主共同斗争会议的一千五百名积极分子分乘五十辆卡车到几乎每一个大工厂和火车站去，呼吁工人们在6月4日发动总罢工。他们还向普通市民散发传单，要求他们支持工人的总罢工。
    名古屋大学理学院的十五位教授和副教授今天发表声明，要求岸信介内阁总辞职和解散国会。这十五个人当中有理论物理学者坂田昌一、有山兼局等。
    据“朝日新闻”今天报道，埼玉县的埼玉大学和埼玉经济短期大学的教授和工作人员从27日起开始征集签名，要求立即解散国会。在27日一天中，就有七十名教授和约一百名工作人员在签名簿上签了名。

    野坂指出，第十六次全国统一行动是自从阻止修改日美“安全条约”斗争开始以来规模最大的一次，不仅进行了空前未有的国会请愿，而且胜利地组织群众针对日本人民的两个敌人——美帝国主义和岸信介内阁——展开了抗议斗争。
    野坂指出，冲向首相官邸和美国大使馆的抗议行动是日本全国广大人民激愤情绪的集中表现。
    野坂指责岸信介仍然不顾日益高涨的日本人民的反对声浪，厚颜无耻地想硬干下去。他说，日本人民绝对不能容许岸信介的阴谋得逞。
    野坂号召全体日共党员和民主力量进一步巩固和推广第十六次全国统一行动的成就，全力组织反对美日两国政府的抗议运动，为阻止批准新“安全条约”、迫使解散国会和把岸信介内阁赶下台而斗争。
    野坂强调指出，目前必须竭尽力量为在6月4日胜利地组织工人展开全国性的罢工和尽快地完成征集两千七百万人的签名（拥有大选投票权的总人数的一半）而奋斗。
    据新华社27日讯　东京消息：东京最大印刷厂之一共同印刷工厂工人一千八百人和附近的五金业工人、装订业工人七百多人，26日下午到街上举行了一个半钟头的示威游行，抗议岸信介非法强使众议院“通过”新日美“安全条约”的暴行，要求岸信介内阁立即下台和解散国会。
    在这以前，共同印刷工会进行全体投票，绝对多数工人表示赞同举行罢工阻止批准新日美“安全条约”。
    全日本印刷出版工会总联合会昨天上午在共同印刷工厂散发了许多传单。日共和社会党在这个工会的基层组织也联合散布传单，呼吁工人起来展开政治性罢工。
