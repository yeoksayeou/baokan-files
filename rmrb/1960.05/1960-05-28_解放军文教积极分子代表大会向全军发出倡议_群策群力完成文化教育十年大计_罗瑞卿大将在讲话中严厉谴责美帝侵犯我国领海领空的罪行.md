Xinhua News Agency, May 27th: The Chinese People's Liberation Army Cultural and Educational Activists' Congress successfully concluded in Beijing today. The congress issued a proposal to the entire army, calling on all officers and soldiers to hold even higher the red banner of the General Line and Mao Zedong Thought, to unite from top to bottom, pool wisdom and efforts, to strive to victoriously complete the "Ten-Year Plan" for cultural education, and to accelerate the building of our army into an excellent, modernized revolutionary force.

General Luo Ruiqing, Senior General Fu Zhong, Senior General Xiao Hua, Senior General Li Jukui, Senior General Li Zhimin, Senior General Wang Xinting, Senior General Fu Qiutao, Lieutenant General Xiao Xiangrong, Lieutenant General Wu Faxian of the Air Force, Lieutenant General Wang Huiqiu of the Air Force, Vice Admiral Liu Daosheng, Lieutenant General Chen Renqi, Lieutenant General Cui Tianmin, Lieutenant General Yuan Shengping, Lieutenant General Mo Wenhua, Major General Li Yimin, Major General Li Lianghan, Major General Liu Youguang, Major General Liu Shaowen, and others attended the closing ceremony of the congress.

Invited to attend the closing ceremony were Yang Haibo, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Communist Youth League Central Committee; Ye Laishi, Deputy Chairman of the Chinese Writing Reform Committee; and representatives from the Ministry of Education, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Women's Federation, the China Association for Science and Technology, and other units.

The closing ceremony was presided over by Senior General Xiao Hua.

General Luo Ruiqing spoke at the meeting. After describing the cultural learning achievements of the entire army, he said: We must redouble our efforts to continuously and persistently carry on the mass movement of cultural learning, and we must unswervingly strive to realize the great goal of popularizing secondary and higher education among cadres in the "Ten-Year Plan."

General Luo Ruiqing said that carrying on the mass movement of cultural learning for a long time within the entire army is not an easy task. This requires not only determination and perseverance, but also correct principles and practical methods. First of all, we must solve the problem ideologically. All comrades in the army must deeply recognize the great significance of cultural education in strengthening the revolutionization of our army and accelerating its modernization, and they must further clarify the purpose of learning culture. Cultural education is the key to unlocking the treasures of military and political science. The tendency to neglect cultural education must be resolutely opposed. However, at the same time, we must also pay attention to preventing the tendency to learn culture for the sake of culture, divorced from politics and divorced from the modernization of our army. He said that in order to ensure that the "Ten-Year Plan" can be adhered to for a long time, it is also necessary to scientifically arrange work and study time under the guidance of the spirit of overall leap forward, and to properly solve the problem of combining work and rest. He emphasized that to ensure the long-term persistence of the mass movement of cultural learning, it is also necessary to actively carry out teaching reforms. He said that cadres have limited time for cultural learning, while the task of popularizing secondary and higher education is heavy. The main method to solve this contradiction is to carry out teaching reforms. The cultural education of the troops has undergone many reforms in teaching content and teaching methods in the past, and must continue to be reformed in the future. The main direction of reform is to further implement the principle of combining learning and application, so that cultural education can better serve the strengthening of the revolutionization and acceleration of the modernization of our army. He said that the long-term persistence of the mass movement of cultural learning must also vigorously promote cadres' self-study. Self-study is the fundamental guarantee for improving teaching effectiveness. We should further open up mass self-study activities and pay more attention to cultivating cadres' self-study habits, so as to lay a solid mass foundation for the long-term persistence of cultural learning. General Luo Ruiqing said that the current situation of cultural education in the entire army is very good. The conditions for long-term persistence are in place. As long as we exert our full effort and persevere, we will definitely be able to gradually approach our established goals and fundamentally change the cultural outlook of our army.

General Luo Ruiqing talked about the ongoing campaign in various units to cultivate the "Three-Eight Style." He said that cultivating a good style of work is an important part of the ideological construction of the troops. Party committees and political organs at all levels must regard this matter as a fundamental task of political and ideological work, both now and in the future, and grasp it conscientiously. Ideology is the foundation of style, and style is the manifestation of ideology in the actual actions of the masses. The "Three-Eight Style" of our army was established on the basis of Mao Zedong's military thought. To better cultivate the "Three-Eight Style," we must first conscientiously study Mao Zedong's military thought. We must also carry out criticism and self-criticism, and resolutely struggle against all thoughts and styles that violate our army's fine traditions. Currently, in carrying out the campaign to cultivate the "Three-Eight Style," we should adhere to the policy of education first and strengthen ideological education work. On the one hand, we should pay attention to commending the good people and good deeds that maintain and carry forward the "Three-Eight Style" that exist in large numbers in our troops; on the other hand, we must resolutely struggle against those few or individual bad thoughts and bad styles that violate the "Three-Eight Style."

In his speech, General Luo Ruiqing also sternly condemned the crimes of US imperialism in invading our territorial waters and airspace and sabotaging the Four-Power Summit. He said: "The evil acts of US imperialism in invading our territorial waters and airspace have now reached as many as 156 times. Our government has issued its 100th serious warning to US imperialism. These acts of aggression by US imperialism must be settled. US imperialism will never escape the just trial and punishment of the Chinese people and the people of the world." He said that any invasion of our territorial waters and airspace by US imperialism will inevitably arouse a hundredfold vigilance from the Chinese people and the officers and soldiers of our army. It is imperative that we take this bullying seriously. We must strengthen our preparedness, accelerate the modernization of our army, and be fully prepared. If US imperialism dares to provoke a war, we must, together with the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the people of the world, resolutely and thoroughly eliminate the aggressors and strive for lasting world peace.

In his speech, General Luo Ruiqing also sternly condemned the criminal actions of US imperialism in invading Soviet airspace and sabotaging the Four-Power Summit, as well as its criminal conspiracy to step up arms expansion and war preparations and actively prepare to launch a war of aggression. He said: "Once the hideous face of US imperialism in invading Soviet airspace and sabotaging the Four-Power Summit is exposed, it will inevitably enable the people of the world to learn beneficial lessons from this event, further raise their awareness, unite, and wage unremitting struggle to smash the aggression and war policies of US imperialism and defend world peace."

After General Luo Ruiqing's speech, amidst majestic music, Senior General Fu Zhong, on behalf of the congress, awarded flags to 51 advanced units on the cultural and educational front of the entire army. The congress also awarded certificates and prizes to all the representatives attending the congress.

Finally, the congress passed a proposal to all officers and soldiers of the army. The proposal stated that all units and cadres of the army must exert full effort, make up their minds, and persevere in the "Ten-Year Plan" to the end. This year, we must earnestly do a good job in secondary education, and strive to ensure that more people participate in learning, that there is sufficient time, that the progress is fast, and that the quality is good; actively develop higher education, and achieve simultaneous opening, development, and improvement; widely carry out scientific and technological popularization education, and strive to improve the scientific knowledge level of all officers and soldiers; vigorously carry out soldiers' cultural education, and promote the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme and the popularization of Putonghua throughout the army; cultural schools should become the base for popularizing higher education in the troops; actively carry out teaching reforms; extensively carry out self-study activities, and continuously expand the self-study team; all full-time and part-time teachers should establish the determination to "teach for ten years and learn for ten years," take the road of being both red and expert, and contribute everything to the cultural and educational cause of the troops; adhere to putting politics in command, adhere to the policy of cultural education serving the revolutionization and modernization of our army, strengthen ideological leadership and organizational leadership, pay attention to overall planning, comprehensive arrangements, and strive for an overall leap forward in military, political, and cultural training and various tasks.

    群策群力完成文化教育十年大计
    罗瑞卿大将在讲话中严厉谴责美帝侵犯我国领海领空的罪行
    据新华社27日讯　中国人民解放军文化教育积极分子代表大会今天在北京胜利闭幕。大会向全军发出倡议书，要求全军官兵更高地举起总路线和毛泽东思想的红旗，上下一致，群策群力，为胜利完成文化教育“十年大计”，为加速建设我军成为一支优良的现代化的革命军队奋勇前进。
    罗瑞卿大将、傅钟上将、萧华上将、李聚奎上将、李志民上将、王新亭上将、傅秋涛上将、萧向荣中将、吴法宪空军中将、王辉球空军中将、刘道生海军中将、陈仁麒中将、崔田民中将、袁升平中将、莫文骅中将、李逸民少将、李良汉少将、刘有光少将、刘绍文少将等，出席了大会闭幕式。
    应邀出席闭幕式的有，共青团中央书记处书记杨海波，中国文字改革委员会副主任叶籁士、教育部、全国总工会、全国妇女联合会、中国科学技术协会等单位的代表。
    闭幕式由萧华上将主持。
    罗瑞卿大将在会上讲了话。他在叙述了全军的文化学习成绩后，说：我们一定要再接再厉地把文化学习的群众运动持续不断地坚持下去，一定要坚定不移地为实现在干部中普及中、高等教育的“十年大计”的伟大目标奋斗到底。
    罗瑞卿大将说，在全军范围内把文化学习的群众运动长期坚持下去，并不是一件轻而易举的事情。这不仅要有决心，有毅力，而且还要有正确的方针和切实可行的办法。首先要从思想上解决问题。全军同志一定要深刻认识文化教育对加强我军革命化和加速我军现代化的重大意义，还要进一步明确学习文化的目的性。文化教育是打开军事、政治宝库的钥匙。忽视文化教育的偏向，是必须坚决反对的。但是，与此同时，我们也要注意防止那种为文化而学文化的脱离政治、脱离我军现代化建设的偏向。他说，要使“十年大计”能够长期坚持，还必须在全面跃进的思想指导下，科学地统一安排工作与学习的时间，并妥善解决劳逸结合的问题。他强调指出，要作到把学习文化的群众运动长期坚持，还必须积极进行教学改革。他说，在职干部文化学习时间有限，而普及中、高等教育任务很重，要解决这个矛盾，主要的方法是进行教学改革。部队文化教育在教学内容和教学方法上，过去已经进行了不少改革，今后还必须继续改革。改革的主要方向是进一步贯彻学用一致的原则，使文化教育更好地为我军加强革命化和加速现代化服务。他说，文化学习的群众运动的长期坚持，还必须大力提倡干部自学。自学是提高教学效果的根本保证。我们应当进一步打开群众性的自学活动，更加注意培养干部的自学习惯，以便为文化学习的长期坚持打下巩固的群众基础。罗瑞卿大将说，目前全军文化教育的形势很好。长期坚持的条件是具备的。只要我们鼓足干劲，坚持不懈，我们就一定能够一步步地接近我们既定的目标，从根本上改变我军的文化面貌。
    罗瑞卿大将谈到了目前各部队正在大张旗鼓地开展培养三八作风运动的问题。他说，培养优良作风，是部队思想建设的重要环节。各级党委和政治机关不论是在当前或是今后，都必须把这件事情当作政治思想工作的一个根本任务，认真抓紧。思想是作风的基础，作风是思想在广大群众实际行动中的表现。我军的三八作风，是在毛泽东军事思想基础上建立起来的。要更好地培养三八作风，首先必须认真学习毛泽东军事思想。还必须开展批评与自我批评，坚决向一切违反我军优良传统的思想作风进行斗争。当前，在开展培养三八作风的运动中，我们应当坚持教育为主的方针，加强思想教育工作。一方面要注意表扬我们部队中大量存在的那些保持和发扬了三八作风的好人好事；另一方面又必须坚决同那些少数的或者个别的违背三八作风的坏思想和坏作风作坚决斗争。
    罗瑞卿大将在讲话中还严厉谴责了美帝国主义侵犯我国领海领空和破坏四国首脑会议的罪行。他说：“美帝国主义侵犯我国领海、领空的罪恶行为，今天已达到一百五十六次之多。我国政府已经对美帝国主义提出了第一百次严重警告。美帝国主义这些侵略罪行，是一定要清算的。美帝国主义绝不能逃脱中国人民和全世界人民的正义的审判和惩罚。”他说，美帝国主义对我国领海、领空的任何一次侵犯，都必然激起中国人民和我军官兵百倍的警惕。帝国主义如此欺负我们，是一定要认真对付的。我们一定要加强戒备，加速我军现代化建设，充分作好准备。如果美帝国主义敢于挑起战争，我们就一定要和以苏联为首的社会主义阵营一起，和全世界人民一起，坚决彻底消灭侵略者，争取世界的持久和平。
    罗瑞卿大将在讲话中，还严厉谴责美帝国主义侵犯苏联领空、破坏四国首脑会议的罪恶行动和加紧扩军备战、积极准备发动侵略战争的罪恶阴谋。他说：“美帝国主义侵犯苏联领空、破坏四国首脑会议的狰狞面目一经暴露，必将使全世界人民从这一事件中得到有益的教训，进一步提高觉悟，团结起来，为粉碎美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，为保卫世界和平进行坚持不懈的斗争。”
    罗瑞卿大将讲话后，在雄壮的乐曲声中，傅钟上将代表大会分别授予全军各部队文化教育战线上五十一个先进单位以奖旗。大会还授予出席大会的全体代表以奖状和奖品。
    最后，大会通过了向全军官兵的倡议书。倡议书中提出，全军各部队和全体干部，都要鼓足干劲，下定决心，把“十年大计”坚持到底，今年，必须切实把中等教育工作搞好，努力做到参加学习的人数多，时间足，进度快，质量好；积极开展高等教育，做到边开办、边发展、边提高；广泛开展科学普及教育，努力提高全体官兵的科学知识水平；大力开展士兵文化教育，并在全军中推行汉语拼音方案和推广普通话；文化学校要成为部队普及高等教育的基地；积极进行教学改革；广泛开展自学活动，不断扩大自学队伍；全体专职和兼职教员要树立“教十年、学十年”的决心，走又红又专的道路，为部队文化教育事业贡献出自己的一切力量；坚持政治挂帅，坚持文化教育为我军革命化、现代化服务的方针，加强思想领导、组织领导，注意统筹兼顾，全面安排，争取军、政、文训练和各项工作的全面跃进。（附图片）
