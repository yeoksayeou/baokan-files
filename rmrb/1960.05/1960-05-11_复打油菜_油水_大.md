    Re-threshing Rapeseed Gives Big "Oil Dividend"
    In order to ensure that not a single grain of this year's bumper rapeseed harvest is lost, the Hexiangqiao Commune Party Committee in Longhui County, Hunan Province, analyzed the situation of this year's rapeseed harvest, where there were many rainy days, uneven drying, and incomplete threshing, and proposed a re-threshing task to guarantee a bumper harvest.
    On April 28th and 29th, the entire commune carried out "three rounds, then three rounds, then three rounds" of re-threshing on the already threshed rapeseed stalks and shells, resulting in an average increase of 9.6 jin per mu. (Jin Shutao)

    复打油菜“油水”大
    湖南隆回县何香桥公社为了使今年丰收的油菜一粒不丢，党委分析了今年收油菜雨天多，翻晒不匀，脱粒不净的情况，提出复打任务，保证丰产丰收。
    4月28日、29日两天，全社把已经脱过粒的油菜秆、壳进行“先三遍、后三遍、再三遍”复打，每亩平均多收九斤六两。（金树淘）
