    Unfortunate Brothers – Syngman Rhee and Nobusuke Kishi
    He Jun With a poem: A car from America, two dogs from America, besieged on all sides, people roaring in anger from all directions. The unfortunate brother goes ahead, the unfortunate brother follows behind, both eating American milk, both heading for the guillotine!
  (Cartoon originally published in the Japanese "Mainichi Shimbun") After grooming, looking in the mirror at their "honorable appearance," unsightly in the mirror, embarrassed outside the mirror, the unfortunate brother's courage is broken, the unfortunate brother is frightened, their fates are the same!
  (Cartoon originally published in the Japanese "Yomiuri Shimbun")

    难兄难弟——李承晚和岸信介
    禾君　配诗一辆美国车，两条美国狗，四面楚歌声，八方人怒吼。难兄前面行，难弟后面来，同吃美国奶，同上断头台！
  （漫画原载日本“每日新闻”）梳洗罢，对镜照“尊容”，镜里无颜镜外窘，难兄胆破难弟惊，命运一般同！
  （漫画原载日本“读卖新闻”）
