The Japanese People Will Never Forget
By a Commentator of This Newspaper

According to a report in the Japanese "Yomiuri Shimbun," the traitorous Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, in referring to the unanimous opposition throughout the country to his use of fascist violence to force the Diet to "pass" the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty on the 21st, shamelessly and arrogantly said that he was not afraid of public opinion, "After a while, people will forget everything."

Is Kishi really not afraid of the strong opposition of the broad masses of the Japanese people? Let us look at the facts. According to Japan News Agency reports, due to the Kishi group's illegal and forcible "passage" of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, imposing this symbol of aggression and enslavement on the Japanese people, the struggle of the Japanese people against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty has developed more rapidly and in greater depth. Thousands of representatives from all over the country have flocked to the Japanese Diet, Kishi's residence, the Liberal Democratic Party office, and the U.S. Embassy to demonstrate and protest. Angry crowds shouted: "The Kishi cabinet must step down immediately!" "Dissolve the Diet!" "Do not recognize the new security treaty!" "Oppose the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty!" "Oppose Eisenhower's visit to Japan!" Japanese newspapers and public opinion have severely condemned Kishi's fascist atrocities. Even United Press International had to admit that "almost all Tokyo newspapers have unanimously attacked this approval," and "Today, outside the Japanese government, it is not easy to find anyone who says a good word for Kishi." According to Kyodo News, facing the increasingly fierce flames of struggle of the broad masses of the Japanese people, Kishi was so frightened that he "could neither sit nor sleep peacefully." He dared not hold press conferences, let alone meet with representatives of the demonstrating and petitioning masses. He not only kept the iron gates of his residence tightly closed, not daring to go out a single step, but also dispatched a large number of police to set up heavy defenses. When his residence was surrounded by demonstrators, Kishi was even so frightened that he "seriously considered escaping by helicopter." It can be seen that Kishi's "not being afraid of public opinion" is a lie to feign composure; he is merely trying to use this rogue attitude to conceal his true fear and stabilize the morale of his small clique of reactionaries.

Kishi's so-called "After a while, people will forget everything" is nothing but a subjective fantasy. The Japanese people will never be as "forgetful" as Kishi hopes, just as the Japanese people have not forgotten that Kishi was a partner of Hideki Tojo and the chief culprit of the war of aggression against China. They will never forget, and even more will not allow, the Kishi cabinet, as the second Tojo cabinet, and Kishi, as the incarnation of Hideki Tojo, to spare no effort in following the United States, firmly binding Japan to the U.S. war chariot, and driving the Japanese people back into the abyss of war disaster. Moreover, the issue currently facing the Japanese people is a major issue concerning the security of the entire nation's fate.

The heroic and patriotic Japanese people have already and are showing with their actual actions that they are by no means forgetful. In order to prevent the revision and ratification of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, and in order to stop the U.S. conspiracy to revive Japanese militarism and plot new wars, for more than a year, the broad masses of workers, peasants, students, intellectuals, citizens, and even religious figures and capitalists, have united closely and persisted in their struggle, with the ranks growing larger and the momentum growing stronger. This precisely shows that the Japanese people have neither forgotten the bitter fruits of the aggressive war brought to them by Japanese militarism, nor have they forgotten the atomic bombs dropped by the United States on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It shows that the Japanese people have neither forgotten the rape of six-year-old Yumiko by U.S. occupation troops, nor have they forgotten that they used Sakai Naka, a mother of six and a peasant woman, as a shooting target for amusement. It shows that the Japanese people have neither forgotten how the U.S. hydrogen bomb test on Bikini Atoll poisoned the lives of the crew members of the Fukuryu Maru, nor have they forgotten the innocent murder of Miyammura Shoji, a student at the University of Music... This debt of blood, one after another, is deeply buried in the hearts of the Japanese people, accumulating into the power of unyielding struggle.

Since the end of the war, the Japanese people's struggle for independence, peace, democracy, and neutrality has risen one after another and continued unabated. Is it not precisely because they have suffered deeply from the scourge of the Japanese militarist war of aggression and have experienced the humiliation and misfortune under U.S. military occupation? The Japanese people's demand to abolish the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty is so widespread and strong, and the struggle against this treaty is surging higher and higher. Is it not precisely because they have not forgotten the pain and disaster that the United States brought them by utilizing the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty"? Is it not precisely because they deeply realize that the new "Security Treaty" will not only continue to ensure that U.S. troops can occupy Japan for a long time, but also greatly increase the danger of dragging Japan into the new wars planned by the United States?

However, it is worth noting that Kishi, while feigning composure, is carrying out a desperate struggle; stepping up plans to "clean up the mess" and launching a counterattack against the Japanese people. According to Kyodo News, Kishi, on the one hand, pretends that he will "not stubbornly seek a third election" as president of the Liberal Democratic Party, attempting to use this to ease the contradictions within the Liberal Democratic Party and ease the contradictions within the ruling group; on the other hand, he proclaims that he will use the "accomplished fact" of the illegal "approval" of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty as a basis to divide the Socialist Party and the Democratic Socialist Party. Kishi also blatantly declared that he would "resolutely struggle" against the Japanese people who oppose the ratification of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. In fact, Kishi has not only declared it, but has already begun to act. In recent days, the Kishi group has dispatched police throughout the country to threaten and suppress the Japanese people. On the 21st in Tokyo, ten thousand police officers surrounded and attacked demonstrating students, and hundreds of students were injured.

Kishi's increasingly exposed ugly face of betraying national interests and acting as a U.S. lackey to the end has aroused even greater anger and resistance from the Japanese people. On the 20th, two million people across Japan held demonstrations, 4.6 million workers went on strike, and representatives from all over the country continued to flock to Tokyo. According to incomplete statistics from the Socialist Party, in one day alone, on the 21st, more than one million petitions from various regions were submitted to the Diet. The Socialist Party has decided not to participate in the activities of the Japanese Diet until the treaty is abolished. Kenji Miyamoto, General Secretary of the Japanese Communist Party, emphasized that the crime of the Kishi group in forcibly "passing" the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" in the Diet will never be forgiven by the people, and the Japanese people will wage an unyielding struggle against their two enemies—the Kishi group and U.S. imperialism. Now, the Japanese people have united more strongly in the struggle to overthrow the Kishi traitorous government, dissolve the Diet, and abolish the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty. Their fighting spirit is growing higher and higher, fully demonstrating their determination not to stop until their goal is achieved; these are precisely the most powerful answers from the Japanese people to Kishi.

    日本人民永远不会忘记
    本报评论员
    据日本“读卖新闻”报道，卖国首相岸信介21日在谈到他采取法西斯暴力强使众议院“通过”日美军事同盟条约而遭到举国一致的反对时，竟狂妄无耻地说，他不怕舆论，“时间一过，人们将把一切都忘掉。”
    岸信介真的不怕日本广大人民的强烈反对吗？让我们来看看事实。据日本通讯社消息，由于岸信介集团非法强行“通过”日美军事同盟条约，把这个象征着侵略和奴役的枷锁强加在日本人民的身上；日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争更加迅速地向纵深发展。来自全国各地成千上万的代表络绎不绝地前往日本国会、岸信介的住所、自由民主党办公处和美国大使馆进行示威抗议。愤怒的群众高呼：“岸内阁立即下台！”“解散国会！”“不承认新安全条约！”“反对日美军事同盟条约！”“反对艾森豪威尔访日！”日本的报刊和公众舆论纷纷对岸信介的法西斯暴行严厉谴责，连合众国际社都不得不承认“几乎所有东京的报纸都一致抨击这次批准”，“今天，在日本政府外面，不容易找到任何一个为岸（信介）说一句好话的人了。”据共同社报道，面对着日本广大人民日益炽烈的斗争火焰，岸信介吓得“坐卧不宁”，既不敢举行记者招待会，更不敢接见示威请愿的群众代表；他不仅紧闭住所的铁门一步不敢外出，而且出动大批警察，重重设置防线。当住所被示威队伍包围以后，岸信介甚至吓得“曾经认真地考虑乘直升飞机逃跑”。可见，岸信介“不怕舆论”是故作镇静的谎话，他不过是想用这种无赖的态度来掩饰其真正的恐惧，稳定它的一小撮反动派的情绪。
    岸信介所谓的“时间一过，人们将把一切都忘掉”，这只不过是一种主观的幻想。日本人民绝不像岸信介所希望的那样“健忘”，正如日本人民至今不曾忘记岸信介是东条英机的伙伴、侵华战争的罪魁祸首一样；他们也决不会忘记、更不会允许作为第二个东条内阁的岸信介内阁、作为东条英机化身的岸信介，不遗余力地追随美国、把日本牢牢地绑到美国的战车上，把日本人民重新驱向战争灾难的深渊。何况，当前摆在日本人民面前的是关系着整个民族命运安危的大问题。
  英勇爱国的日本人民，已经和正在用自己的实际行动表明他们绝不是健忘的。为了阻止修改和批准日美军事同盟条约，为了制止美国复活日本军国主义、策划新战争的阴谋，一年多来，广大的工人、农民、学生、知识分子、市民以至宗教界人士和资本家，紧密团结、坚持斗争，队伍越来越大、声势越来越盛。这正是说明日本人民既不曾忘记日本军国主义给他们带来的侵略战争的苦果，也不曾忘记美国在广岛和长崎上空投下的原子弹；说明日本人民既不曾忘记美国占领军对六岁女孩由美子的强奸暴行，也不曾忘记他们把六个孩子的母亲、农妇坂井中当作嘻戏作乐的枪靶子；说明日本人民既不曾忘记美国在比基尼岛上进行的氢弹试验曾怎样毒害福龙号船员的生命，也不曾忘记音乐大学学生宫村祥之的无辜被杀……。这一笔又一笔的血债深仇，深深地埋在日本人民的心底，积聚成为不屈不挠的斗争的力量。
    战后以来，日本人民争取独立、和平、民主、中立的斗争此伏彼起、持续不断，难道不正是因为他们深受日本军国主义侵略战争的祸患，历尽了美军占领下的屈辱和不幸？日本人民废除日美军事同盟条约的要求如此广泛和强烈，反对这个条约的斗争一浪高似一浪，难道不正是因为他们丝毫也不曾忘记美国利用日美“安全条约”曾给他们带来什么样的痛苦和灾难？难道不正是因为他们深刻地认识到新的“安全条约”不仅将继续保证美军得以长期占领日本，而且大大增加了把日本卷进美国策划的新战争中去的危险？
    然而值得警惕的是，岸信介在故作镇静的同时，正在进行垂死的挣扎；加紧策划“收拾局面”，向日本人民进行反扑。据共同社报道，岸信介一方面佯称他将“不固执地要第三次竞选”自由民主党总裁，企图借此缓和自由民主党内的矛盾，和缓统治集团内部的矛盾；一方面宣扬要利用非法“批准”日美军事同盟条约的“既成事实为基础”对社会党和民主社会党进行分化。岸信介并且明目张胆地声称要同反对批准日美军事同盟条约的日本人民“进行坚决的斗争”。实际上，岸信介不止是宣告，而且已经开始了行动。连日以来，岸信介集团在全国各地都出动警察对日本人民进行威胁和镇压。21日在东京，一万警察包围和攻击了示威的学生，有成百的学生被打伤。
    岸信介日益暴露的出卖民族利益、充当美国走狗到底的丑恶面目，已经激起了日本人民更大的愤怒和反抗。20日，日本全国二百万人举行示威，四百六十万工人举行罢工，全国各地的代表源源不断地涌向东京。据社会党不完全的统计，21日一天之内，各地代表递送到国会的请愿书就达一百万份以上。社会党已决定决不参加日本国会的活动，直到废除这个条约为止。日本共产党总书记宫本显治强调指出，岸信介集团在国会强行“通过”新日美“安全条约”的罪行永远得不到人民的原谅，日本人民将同他们的两个敌人——岸信介集团和美帝国主义进行不屈不挠的斗争。现在，日本人民已在打倒岸信介卖国政府、解散国会、废除日美军事同盟条约的斗争中更坚强地团结起来了。他们斗志日益高昂，充分表现出不达目的誓不休止的决心；这些正是日本人民对于岸信介的最有力的回答。
