On the 14th, a petitioning contingent of 100,000 people in Tokyo braved the torrential rain and surged toward the Diet like a roaring tide. The petitioning masses demanded the abolition of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, the Diet's passage of a resolution of no confidence in the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet, and the dissolution of the Diet. Representatives from various regions submitted petitions to the Diet signed by seven million people from all over Japan.
