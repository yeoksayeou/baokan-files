Xinhua News Agency, May 29th: Under the leadership and affectionate care of the Chinese Communist Party, and in accordance with the policy of serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor, the Young Pioneer organizations across the country have launched a vigorous children's movement in the past year, powerfully promoting the all-round development of morality, intelligence, and physical education for children.

In the past year, the "Long Live the Three Red Banners" education activities, the three activities of planting, eliminating the four pests, emphasizing hygiene, and speaking Mandarin, the large-scale establishment of factories and small farms, scientific and technological activities, and extracurricular reading activities carried out by Young Pioneer organizations in various places among the vast number of children have achieved great success. The number of Young Pioneers nationwide has also increased from 44 million last year to 50 million this year.

The "Long Live the Three Red Banners" education campaign was widely carried out by Young Pioneer organizations in various places last winter and this spring, enabling more than 90% of children across the country to receive a vivid socialist and communist education. During this education campaign, Young Pioneer organizations in various places also educated children on the deeds of Chairman Mao leading the revolutionary struggle. Children in Liaoning, Anhui, Guizhou, Guangzhou and other places generally organized reading groups to read Chairman Mao's revolutionary stories. In Shenyang and Dalian alone, there were more than 10,000 such groups. Most students above the third grade of primary school participated in reading groups, reading books such as "Around Chairman Mao," "Following Chairman Mao on the Long March," and "Chairman Mao Among the Masses." When carrying out reading activities, various places also organized children to visit veteran revolutionaries and model heroes, hold exhibitions and galleries, and show slides, organize poetry recitations, etc., to help children understand the history of Chairman Mao leading the revolutionary struggle more systematically and vividly. Through these activities, the children have become more fond of the Party and Chairman Mao. "Reading Chairman Mao's storybooks, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and being good students of Chairman Mao" has become a glorious fashion among the vast number of children.

Children across the country also actively participated in social activities within their capabilities. When adults made a great leap forward, they delivered Leap Forward tea, performed慰问戏[comfort performances], and delivered honor rolls; when adults established people's communes, they launched a movement to "do good deeds for the people's communes." In the Shenyang's movement to establish urban people's communes on a large scale, Young Pioneers throughout the city made more than 50,000 toys and sent them to commune nurseries, selected more than 10,000 outstanding team members to teach singing and dancing in kindergartens, and tell stories to young children.

Planting, eliminating the four pests, emphasizing hygiene, and speaking Mandarin are the three most widely carried out activities among children across the country. Children in cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuhan, Shenyang, Xi'an, Chongqing, and Guangzhou generally devoted themselves to the patriotic health campaign. In Shanghai, more than 900,000 children are active in various streets, stations, theaters, stores, and neighborhoods, publicizing the benefits of carrying out the patriotic health campaign. Children in Tianjin also manufactured more than 160,000 pieces of pest control and cleaning tools. The personal hygiene of children in various places has also been greatly improved.

Responding to the Party's call to "green the motherland," children actively participated in afforestation activities. In 1959, children across the country planted a total of 3 billion trees. In the past year, children in various places have been planting fruit trees while afforesting. According to statistics from 31 counties in Zhejiang Province, more than 6,000 "Young Pioneer Hundred Fruit Gardens" have been built. These "Hundred Fruit Gardens" generally have an area of one or two mu, and the types of fruit trees include more than ten varieties such as oranges, apples, pears, and loquats, and even dozens. During the afforestation campaign in the autumn of last year, the children in the Kaifeng area built 12,000 Young Pioneer forests, more than 5,000 Young Pioneer orchards, and 180 Red Scarf horticultural farms along the old course of the Yellow River and the Longhai Railway.

The activities of children in various places to speak Mandarin have also achieved great results. According to statistics from 13 provinces and cities including Fujian, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Yunnan, and Gansu, more than 34 million children participated in learning Mandarin, of which more than 20 million children have initially learned it.

Children across the country have also launched large-scale activities to learn science and technology. In large and medium-sized cities such as Shanghai, Beijing, Shenyang, Harbin, Anshan, and Qiqihar, children have launched a craze for learning radio, semiconductors, aviation models, chemical engineering, electrical engineering, etc. In the vast rural areas, children have carried out activities such as plant hybridization, grafting, and cultivating new varieties. Since the launch of scientific and technological activities in Shanghai this spring, more than 90% of middle school students and more than 80% of primary school students above the third grade, a total of more than 700,000 people, have participated in scientific and technological activities, establishing more than 25,000 science and technology groups. Various scientific and technological activities have blossomed everywhere in middle and primary schools. Many scientific and technological and educational institutions have also held popular lectures on science and technology such as atomic energy, electronics, and rockets for children. Science and technology, education institutions inside and outside schools in Shenyang, Harbin, Qiqihar and other cities used the method of lecturing and doing at the same time among children to quickly popularize the preliminary knowledge of radio. More than 40,000 children in Yuncheng County, Shanxi Province participated in experiments such as plant hybridization, variety improvement, and high-yield cotton and wheat. The scientific and technological activities of children are closely integrated with productive labor. At present, children across the country have established 490,000 small factories and 410,000 small farms, as well as many small breeding farms and small nurseries. Each member of the scientific research group of the radio factory of Jingshi Street Primary School in Luoyang City has one or two inventions. The seven-use radio and headphone-speaker dual-use audio oscillator they successfully trial-produced have been put into production. An automatic stapler designed by five Young Pioneers from Shanghai No. 51 Middle School has been adopted by the factory. In the past three years, children in Yuncheng County, Shanxi Province have innovated more than 2,000 tools and tested new crop varieties, including two crops of wheat a year, and "two-story" crops with tomatoes on the branches and potatoes on the roots.

In carrying out the above activities, Young Pioneer organizations in various places have paid attention to giving children adequate rest, combining work and rest, ensuring that they learn the in-class subjects well, and actively carrying out physical exercises, so that children can become three-good students with healthy bodies and minds, good health, good study, and good work.

    教育与生产劳动相结合　德育智育体育全面发展
    少年儿童在毛泽东时代健康成长
    全国90％的少年儿童受到“三面红旗万万岁”教育，五千万人带上红领巾
    新华社29日讯　全国各地少先队组织，在中国共产党的领导和亲切关怀下，根据教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，一年来开展了蓬蓬勃勃的少年儿童运动，有力地促进着少年儿童德育、智育、体育的全面发展。
    一年中，各地少先队在广大儿童中开展的“三面红旗万万岁”教育活动，种植、除四害讲卫生、讲普通话三项活动，大办工厂、小农场和科学技术活动，以及课外阅读等活动，都取得了很大成绩。全国少先队员也已从去年的四千四百万人增加到今年的五千万人。
    各地少先队组织在去冬今春广泛开展了“三面红旗万万岁”的教育活动，使全国90％以上的少年儿童受到了一次生动的社会主义、共产主义教育。在这次教育活动中，各地少先队还向少年儿童进行了毛主席领导革命斗争事迹的教育。辽宁、安徽、贵州、广州等地的少年儿童，普遍组织了阅读毛主席革命故事的读书小组。沈阳和旅大两市组织的这种小组就有一万多个，小学三年级以上的学生大部参加了读书小组，阅读了“在毛主席周围”、“跟随毛主席长征”和“毛主席在群众中”等书。各地在开展读书活动时，还组织儿童访问革命老前辈和模范英雄人物，举办展览会、画廊和放映幻灯，组织诗歌朗诵会等，帮助儿童比较系统、形象地了解毛主席领导革命斗争的历史。经过这些活动，孩子们都更加热爱党和毛主席，“读毛主席的故事书，听毛主席的话，作毛主席的好学生”，已成为广大少年儿童的光荣风尚。
    全国少年儿童还积极参加了力所能及的社会活动。大人大跃进，他们就送跃进茶、演慰问戏、送光荣榜；大人办人民公社，他们就掀起“为人民公社作好事”的运动。沈阳市在大办城市人民公社运动中，全市少先队员作了五万多件玩具送给公社托儿所，选派了一万多优秀队员到幼儿园教唱歌跳舞，给幼儿讲故事。
    种植、除四害讲卫生和讲普通话，是全国少年儿童中开展得最广泛的三项活动。上海、天津、武汉、沈阳、西安、重庆、广州等城市的少年儿童普遍投入了爱国卫生运动。上海市有九十多万名少年儿童活跃在各街道、车站、剧院、商店和里弄，宣传开展爱国卫生运动的好处。天津市的少年儿童，还制造了除害、清扫工具十六万多件。各地少年儿童个人卫生状况也有了很大改善。
    广大少年儿童，响应党的“绿化祖国”的号召，积极参加植树造林活动。1959年，全国少年儿童共植树三十亿株，近一年来各地少年儿童在造林的同时，又大种果树。浙江省据三十一个县的统计，已建成“少年百果园”六千多个，这些“百果园”的面积一般有一、二亩，果树种类有桔子、苹果、梨、枇杷等十多种，多的几十种。开封地区的少年儿童在去年秋季造林运动中，在黄河故道和陇海路两旁营造了少年林一万二千个，少年果园五千多个，红领巾园艺场一百八十个。
    各地少年儿童讲普通话的活动，也取得了很大成绩。据福建、广东、浙江、云南、甘肃等十三个省、市统计，有三千四百多万少年儿童参加学普通话，其中二千多万儿童已初步学会。
    全国少年儿童还大规模地开展了学习科学技术的活动，在上海、北京、沈阳、哈尔滨、鞍山、齐齐哈尔等大、中城市，少年儿童掀起了学习无线电、半导体、航空模型、化工、电工等活动的热潮；在广大农村，少年儿童开展了植物杂交、嫁接、培育新品种等活动。上海市少年儿童今年春天开展科学技术活动以来，全市90％以上的中学生、80％多的三年级以上的小学生，共七十多万人参加了科学技术活动，建立了二万五千多个科技小组。各种科学技术活动在各中、小学遍地开花，许多科技、教育机关还为少年儿童举办了原子能、电子学、火箭等科学技术的通俗讲座。沈阳、哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔等市校内校外的科技、教育机构，在少年儿童中采用边讲边做的办法，很快普及了无线电的初步知识。山西运城县有四万多名少年儿童参加了植物杂交、改良品种、棉麦高额丰产等试验。少年儿童的科技活动，密切结合了生产劳动。目前，全国少年儿童已建立了小工厂四十九万个，小农场四十一万个，还有许多小饲养场、小苗圃等。洛阳市敬事街小学收音机小工厂的科学研究小组的组员，每人都有一、两项创造，他们试制成功的七用收音机和耳机、喇叭二用音频振荡器等，有的已投入生产。上海市五十一中五个少先队员设计的一种自动装钉机已被工厂采用。山西运城县少年儿童近三年来革新的工具和试验出的作物新品种，已有二千多项，其中包括一年两熟的小麦，枝上结番茄、根上结马铃薯的“两层楼”作物等。
    各地少先队在开展上述各项活动中，都注意了使少年儿童得到充分休息，做到劳逸结合，保证把课内科目学好，并积极开展体育锻炼，使少年儿童成为身心健康，身体好、学习好、工作好的三好学生。
