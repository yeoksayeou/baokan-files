Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 17th: Anti-China and anti-Chinese activities instigated by powerful groups in Indonesia are becoming increasingly fierce. The Riau Provincial Prosecutor's Office, which directly ordered the armed hijacking of the "Da Bao Kang" ship, is further making things difficult for returning overseas Chinese, detaining their belongings, and, following the house arrest of our Consul in Samarinda, has once again infringed on personal freedom, unjustifiably beating overseas Chinese and detaining leaders of overseas Chinese organizations in Pekanbaru.

On May 6th, when a group of overseas Chinese in Pekanbaru were preparing to return to China on the "Jin Hai Sheng" ship, Harahap, the Prosecutor General of the Riau Provincial Prosecutor's Office, and official Kaharuddin, under the pretext of inspecting luggage, made all sorts of difficulties for these overseas Chinese. For example, four pairs of slippers, one pair of shoes, three pillowcases, two blankets, two pairs of pants, and one mat belonging to Xu Jinpao's family of six, and one pair of pants belonging to Li Rongkun were unreasonably confiscated. Three mats and two mattresses belonging to Shen Qingshun's family were detained. When he requested that these two prosecutor's office officials allow him to keep one for the five family members to share, he was refused. The overseas Chinese were subjected to another inspection when they boarded the ship that day. All of Yang Lingxia's personal belongings in her handbag were detained, except for one set of clothes. Xu Jinpao's family of six were only allowed to bring one set of underwear each, and all their outerwear was detained.

On May 7th, when Huang Weichong's wife was being inspected, the prosecutor wanted to detain her kapok mattress. Kaharuddin said it was new and not allowed to be taken. Overseas Chinese Ni Qingxiang translated for Huang Weichong's wife, saying that it had been used for six months and was not new. Kaharuddin became furious and said, "Get out of here, who are you!" He then kicked him hard, and Ni Qingxiang immediately pinned his foot. At this time, the prosecutor's office staff surrounded and beat Ni Qingxiang. Dockworker Li Laide stepped forward to dissuade them but was falsely accused of conspiring to beat the prosecutor.

On May 9th, Li Qingde, chairman of the Pekanbaru Chinese General Association, and Zeng Lianfa, a leader of overseas Chinese organizations, were detained by the prosecutor's office for four hours. The Riau Provincial Prosecutor General falsely accused the Pekanbaru Chinese General Association of holding a meeting to incite overseas Chinese to oppose the Indonesian government and threatened to burn down the entire Chinese district in Pekanbaru. The Prosecutor General also threatened them not to file any more complaints.

    印度尼西亚廖内省检察署
    竟无理殴打和扣留华侨
    新华社17日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚有势力集团策动的反华排华活动日益凶恶。曾经直接命令武力劫持“大宝康号”的廖内省检察署又进一步刁难归国华侨，扣留归侨财物，并且竟继三马林达软禁我国领事事件之后，再次发生侵犯人身自由，无理殴打华侨和扣留北干巴鲁华侨团体领导人的事件。
    5月6日，一批北干巴鲁华侨准备搭“金海胜”轮船回国时，廖内省检察署检察长哈拉哈普和官员卡哈努丁借口检查行李，对这些华侨百般刁难。如华侨许金炮全家六人的四双拖鞋、一双鞋子、三个枕头套、两条毯子、两条裤子、一张席子，李荣昆的一条裤子都被无理没收。沈庆顺一家三张席子、两条褥子被扣留。他要求这两个检察署官员允予留下一条供五人合用，竟然也遭拒绝。华侨当天登船时又受一次检查。华侨杨玲霞的一个手提袋中的随身行李，除准带一套衣服外，全被扣留。许金炮全家六人只准每人带内衣一套，外衣全被扣留。
    5月7日，当检查到黄卫崇夫人时，检察官要扣留她的一条木棉垫褥子。卡哈努丁说那是新的，不准带。华侨倪庆祥在旁替黄卫崇夫人翻译说，已用了六个月，不是新的。卡哈努丁竟然大发雷霆说：“滚开，你是什么人！”接着又用脚猛踢他，当即被倪庆祥按住脚。这时在旁的检察署人员就围上去殴打倪庆祥。码头工人李来得上前劝解，反被诬指同谋殴打检察官。
    5月9日，北干巴鲁中华总会主席李清德、华侨团体领导人曾连发被检察署扣留了四小时。廖内省检察长诬指北干巴鲁中华总会曾开会煽动华侨反对印度尼西亚政府，恫吓将把北干巴鲁市内华侨区烧光，检察长还威胁说，不准他们再去告状。
