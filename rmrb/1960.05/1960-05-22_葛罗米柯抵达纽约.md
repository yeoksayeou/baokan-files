    Xinhua News Agency, New York, May 21st: TASS reports: Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko arrived in New York yesterday by plane from Paris. He is here to attend the United Nations Security Council meeting scheduled for May 23rd. The meeting will discuss "the aggressive acts of U.S. military aircraft against the Soviet Union that pose a threat to universal peace." Gromyko issued a statement to reporters at New York Airport. Gromyko said that the Soviet government raised this issue to the United Nations because the U.S. government's policy of provocation against the Soviet Union is extremely dangerous.
    Gromyko said that the above-mentioned policy of the U.S. government has been exposed, and the relevant facts have been made public by the Soviet government and Soviet Premier Khrushchev personally. However, this is not enough, especially given that the U.S. government, judging from the statements of American national leaders and President Eisenhower himself, has not condemned the aforementioned policy, nor has it taken measures to end it.
    Gromyko pointed out that all these circumstances obligate the United Nations, especially the Security Council, to pay serious attention to this issue and take measures to stop the policy of provocation and aggression.

    葛罗米柯抵达纽约
    据新华社21日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：苏联外交部部长葛罗米柯昨天乘飞机从巴黎抵达纽约。他是来参加定于5月23日举行的联合国安全理事会会议的。这次会议将讨论“关于美国军用飞机对苏联进行了对普遍和平造成威胁的侵略行动”问题。葛罗米柯在纽约机场向记者发表了声明。葛罗米柯说，苏联政府所以向联合国提出这个问题，是由于美国政府执行的对苏联进行挑衅的政策具有最大的危险性。
    葛罗米柯说，美国政府的上述政策已经被揭露，并由苏联政府和苏联政府首脑赫鲁晓夫亲自把有关的事实公诸于世了。但是，这是不够的，何况从美国国家领导人和艾森豪威尔总统本人的声明看来，美国政府没有谴责上述的政策，也没有采取措施来结束这种政策。
    葛罗米柯指出，所有这些情况使联合国，首先是安全理事会，有义务对这一问题给以严重注意，并采取措施以停止挑衅和侵略的政策。
