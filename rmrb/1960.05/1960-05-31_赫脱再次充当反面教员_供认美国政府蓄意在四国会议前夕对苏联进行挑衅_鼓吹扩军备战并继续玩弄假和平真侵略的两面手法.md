Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 30th: After U.S. President Eisenhower delivered a television and radio address to the nation, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles made a lengthy statement at a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on May 27th, once again attempting to justify the crimes of U.S. spy planes invading the Soviet Union and sabotaging the Four-Power Summit Conference.

This hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee was specifically convened to investigate the U.S. government's handling of the U.S. spy plane invasion of the Soviet Union and the Paris Four-Power Summit Conference. The exposure of the ugly face of the U.S. government in these matters has not only been severely condemned by just public opinion in various countries but has also aroused indignation among the people at home. Against this background, many congressmen have risen up to demand that Congress conduct this investigation of the U.S. government.

Dulles' statement desperately tried to portray the U.S. government as an innocent victim and counter-accused the Soviet Union of "sabotaging" the summit conference, but the result was that the more he tried to cover up, the darker it became, and he once again exposed himself. When talking about the U-2 spy plane that was shot down after invading the Soviet Union, Dulles had to admit that the U.S. government was fully aware of the possible consequences of this provocative crime for the Four-Power Summit Conference and that it deliberately engaged in this crime as the conference approached. Dulles said, "The U-2 program was an important and effective intelligence activity. We knew that the failure of any mission under this program would have serious consequences, but we believed that the great benefits derived from it justified taking the risks involved." He also said, "The decision not to suspend this flight program as the summit meeting approached was the right decision. Subsequent seasonal conditions would hinder the acquisition of very important intelligence." Although Dulles had hypocritically said a lot about how the United States valued the Four-Power Summit Conference in the first part of his statement, he could not conceal the United States' intention to deliberately sabotage the conference when he talked about this. Dulles indicated that the U.S. government considered it "unwise" to stop such spy flights "because of these political negotiations."

Like his superior, Eisenhower, Dulles also believed that lying and playing tricks were completely justified. He called the U.S. government's shameless sophistry after the U-2 spy plane was shot down as "following a general policy of concealment," insisting that "this was appropriate." He then said that later, "when it became very clear that the plane and the pilot were in Soviet hands," the United States was forced to admit it "to adapt to the situation that had occurred." Therefore, he believed that the U.S. government's ugly and self-contradictory actions "were correct." He shamelessly said that he believed "the vast majority of Americans would agree with this."

Dulles also admitted that the U.S.'s so-called suspension of spy flights before the summit was only "because the U-2 system had been compromised," "just as any other intelligence mission would be suspended under such circumstances."

When talking about the specific circumstances of the Paris conference, Dulles revealed that the U.S. government officials, with a guilty conscience, had gone to Paris fantasizing that the Soviet government might not delve into the matter too deeply. However, the Soviet government head's solemn demands on May 16 regarding the U.S. plane's invasion shattered their hopes of the thieves escaping justice, which made them angry out of humiliation. Dulles was clearly still resentful when making this statement, so he greatly slandered Khrushchev for putting forward "insulting and outrageous conditions" and taking "extreme attitudes," saying that "the Soviets came all the way from Moscow to Paris merely to sabotage the conference," etc. He also deliberately mystified the situation, adopting the low-level methods of rumors and slanders commonly used by American anti-Soviet writers, using many pages in the statement to carry out so-called "analysis" of the reasons for the Soviet actions, attempting to distract people from the crimes of the thieves and instead study the motives and reasons of the victim interrogating the thieves.

Dulles admitted without concealment that the United States had absolutely no intention of bowing its head and admitting its guilt at the Paris conference in order to allow the summit conference to be held, and what it cared about was how to sabotage the conference and blame the Soviet Union. Dulles said, "Of course, there is no doubt that the President could never accept Mr. Khrushchev's insulting and outrageous conditions. However, we know very well that it is important to show the world that it was Khrushchev, not anyone else, who brought the summit meeting to a crisis."

In his statement, Dulles praised Britain and France for being "united" with the United States in Paris and being "loyal" to their "common goals."

Although the faces of the American aggressors have been greatly exposed after sabotaging the summit conference, Dulles knows that this is by no means a good thing for the United States, so he emphasized that it is necessary to continue to play the double-faced tactics of false detente and real war preparation, false peace and real aggression, in an attempt to continue to arouse people's illusions about the United States. In the last part of his statement, he tried his best to strike a conciliatory tone, saying that the "main direction" of American policy "remains correct and should continue to be implemented. The lesson of Paris is that we should implement these policies with renewed effort." Dulles said that he wanted to encourage "those within the 'Communist bloc' who 'advocate a peaceful line'" because of the United States' "willingness to resolve outstanding international issues in a serious and reasonable manner."

He also said with vicious intent, "At this stage, we, all of us, have an obligation to calmly and steadily pay attention to the world stage and avoid actions, statements, and attitudes that may unnecessarily exacerbate international tensions. If tensions were to be exacerbated, it should be clearly the fault of the Soviets, and we should not give them any pretext for taking actions that would have this effect." He also tried to re-cloak American imperialism with the peace cloak that had been torn off, saying with sweet words that the United States must "continue to seek progress with the Soviet Union in outstanding issues in a practical way." Dulles indicated that the United States still insisted on a position of only supervising disarmament without actually disarming. He said: "First, we will not stop the most determined, patient, and ingenious efforts to find ways to supervise the arms race." But at the same time, he also advocated that the United States should "clearly demonstrate" that it was "prepared" militarily and strengthen the collusion between the United States and its allies in its various military blocs.

### 赫脱再次充当反面教员  供认美国政府蓄意在四国会议前夕对苏联进行挑衅  鼓吹扩军备战并继续玩弄假和平真侵略的两面手法

    赫脱再次充当反面教员
    供认美国政府蓄意在四国会议前夕对苏联进行挑衅
    鼓吹扩军备战并继续玩弄假和平真侵略的两面手法
    新华社30日讯　华盛顿消息：在美国总统艾森豪威尔向美国全国发表电视广播演说以后两天，美国国务卿赫脱27日在参议院外交委员会的意见听取会上发表了长篇声明，再度为美国间谍飞机侵苏和破坏四国政府首脑会议的罪行狡辩。
    参议院外交委员会这一次的意见听取会，是专门为了调查美国政府对于间谍飞机侵苏事件和巴黎四国首脑会议的处理而举行的。美国政府在这些事情上丑恶面目的大暴露，不仅遭到了各国公正舆论的猛烈谴责，而且引起了国内人民的激愤。在这样的背景下，许多议员群起要求国会对美国政府进行这一调查。
    赫脱的声明竭力把美国政府打扮成无辜的受害者，并且反咬苏联“破坏”首脑会议，但是结果却是愈描愈黑，又一次进行了自我暴露。赫脱在谈到U—2型间谍飞机侵苏被击落事件时不得不供认，美国政府完全明白这种挑衅罪行对四国首脑会议可能导致的后果，而且是蓄意在会议临近时从事这种罪行的。赫脱说，“U—2计划是一个重要的和有效的情报活动。我们知道，在这个计划之下的任何使命的失败都会产生严重的后果，但是我们认为从这里面得到的很大的利益说明去冒所包含的风险是值得的”。他又说，“当最高级会议临近的时候不停止这项飞行计划的决定是一个正确的决定。随后的季节的条件会阻碍获得非常重要的情报”。尽管赫脱在他的声明的第一部分里假惺惺地说了许多美国如何重视四国首脑会议的话，但是他谈到这里却无法掩盖美国蓄意破坏这次会议的居心。赫脱表明，美国政府认为“由于这种政治谈判”而停止这种间谍飞行是“不明智的”。
    像他的上司艾森豪威尔一样，赫脱也认为说谎耍赖是完全正当的。他把美国政府在U—2型间谍飞机被击落以后的无耻狡赖称为“遵循进行掩饰的总方针”，硬说“这是适当的”。他又说，以后“当那架飞机和驾驶员是在苏联人手中这件事已经变得很清楚的时候”，美国被迫承认“则是适应已发生的局势”。因此，他认为美国政府这样丑态百出、自己打自己嘴巴的做法“是正确的”。他居然厚颜地说，他认为“绝大多数美国人会同意这一点”。
    赫脱也承认，美国所谓在首脑会议前已经停止间谍飞行只是“由于U—2系统遭到了损害”，“就像在这种情况下也会停止任何其他情报使命一样”。
    谈到巴黎会议的具体情况时，赫脱透露，美国政府负责人怀着做贼心虚的心情到巴黎时曾经幻想苏联政府可能不予深究。但是苏联政府首脑5月16日就美国飞机侵略行动提出的严正要求使盗贼蒙混过关的侥幸之心落空了，因此使得他们老羞成怒。赫脱在发表这一声明时显然犹有余忿，他因此大事诬蔑赫鲁晓夫提出了“侮辱性的、蛮横的条件”，采取“极端的态度”，说什么“苏联人从莫斯科远道来到巴黎仅仅是为了破坏这次会议”等等。他还故弄玄虚，采用了美国反苏文人惯用的造谣诬蔑的低级手法，在声明中用很多篇幅进行所谓对苏联行动的原因的“分析”，企图使人们不去注意盗贼的罪行，倒去研究失主审问盗贼的动机和原因。
    赫脱供认不讳，美国在巴黎会议上完全没有低头认罪以使首脑会议得以举行的意愿，它所关心的只是如何能破坏会议而又把责任赖在苏联身上。赫脱说，“当然，毫无疑问总统绝不能接受赫鲁晓夫先生提出的侮辱性的、蛮横的条件。然而，我们知道得很清楚，重要的是向全世界表明，使最高级会议面临危机的正是赫鲁晓夫而不是任何其他人。”
    赫脱在声明中夸奖了英国和法国在巴黎同美国“团结一致”，“忠于”它们的“共同目的”。
    尽管在破坏了首脑会议以后美国侵略者的面目已经大暴露，赫脱知道这对美国来说决不是什么美好的事情，因此他强调必须继续玩弄假和缓、真备战，假和平、真侵略的两面手法，企图继续引起人们对美国的幻想。他在声明的最后一部分竭力装出缓和的调子说，美国的政策的“主要方针仍然是正确的，应当继续执行下去。巴黎的教训是，我们应当以新的努力来贯彻这些方针。”赫脱说他要使“共产党集团内部”“主张采取和平路线的人”应当由于美国“准备以认真和合理的态度来解决悬而未决的国际问题而得到鼓励”。
    他还用心刻毒地说，“在这阶段，我们、我们大家都有义务冷静地、沉着地注意世界舞台，避免也许会不必要加剧国际紧张局势的行动、声明和态度。如果紧张的局势竟然会加剧的话，那应该显然是苏联人的过失，我们不应该让他们有采取将产生这种效果的行动的借口。”他还力图重新给美帝国主义披上那件已被撕下来的和平外衣，他甜言蜜语地说，美国必须“继续设法以切合实际的方式同苏联在悬而未决的问题上取得进展”，赫脱表明，美国仍然坚持只监督而不裁军的立场。他说：“首先，我们将不停止最坚决的、耐心的、机智的努力来寻找使军备竞赛受到监督的方法。”但他同时又鼓吹美国要“明显地表明”在军事上“是有准备的”，并且加强美国同它的各个军事集团中的盟国的勾结。
