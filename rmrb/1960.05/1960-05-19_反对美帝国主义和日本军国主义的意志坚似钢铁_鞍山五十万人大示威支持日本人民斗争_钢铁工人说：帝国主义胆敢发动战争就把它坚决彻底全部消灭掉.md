Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, May 18th: The steel city of Anshan saw an unprecedented rally and demonstration today, with 500,000 people resolutely supporting the Japanese people's just struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.

The people of Anshan, especially the steel workers, suffered from the oppression, plunder, and fascist rule of Japanese imperialism for thirty long years. Starting in 1915, when Japanese imperialism extended its claws to plunder Anshan's iron ore resources, the workers of Anshan were the first to suffer from the oppression and exploitation of Japanese imperialism. After the "September 18th Incident" in 1931, when Japanese imperialism forcibly occupied Northeast China, the people and the vast number of workers in Anshan lived a life of misery directly under the iron heel of the Japanese invaders until the victory of the Anti-Japanese War in 1945. During these thirty long years, many Chinese workers died almost every day. In 1944 alone, more than 1,900 people were killed by the Japanese fascist bandits. One major explosion at the Dagushan Iron Mine killed 72 workers. The people of Anshan and the steel workers have fresh memories of the towering crimes of Japanese imperialism, so when the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries plotted new schemes of aggressive war today, it immediately aroused their great indignation and resolute opposition.

At a little after 2:00 p.m. today, angry people gathered from the blast furnaces, open hearth furnaces, and rolling mills of Anshan Iron and Steel Works (An'gang), and from all the streets of the city, converging on the city's central square – Victory Square. They waved flags, carried huge banners, and shouted slogans such as "Oppose the revival of Japanese militarism" and "Oppose the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty." The number of people expected to attend the conference was 400,000, but the actual attendance exceeded 500,000. Yang Shijie, First Secretary of the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and other party and government leaders, as well as heads of various departments and people's organizations, attended the conference. Soviet experts stationed in Anshan and Vietnamese interns also attended the conference.

After the conference began, Yang Shijie, First Secretary of the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, spoke first. On behalf of the people of the city, he expressed firm support for the Japanese people's just struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and extended heartfelt congratulations to the Japanese people on the significant achievements they have made in the struggle, and wished the Japanese people greater victory in the Sixteenth National Unified Action. He said that we must not sit idly by and watch the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries collude with each other, dreaming of re-embarking on the old path of aggression and attempting to re-oppress and enslave our people. We must warn U.S. imperialism and the Kishi Nobusuke clique that the times have changed, and the days when imperialism could do whatever it wanted are gone forever. The liberated Chinese people have full confidence and strength to smash any provocation by U.S. imperialism against our country. Anyone who dares to impose a new war on the Chinese people will surely be smashed to pieces.

Subsequently, the heads of various people's organizations, and representatives of workers, peasants, and urban people's communes spoke at the meeting one after another. Meng Tai, a nationally renowned labor model and deputy director of the An'gang Iron Smelting Plant, expressed the firm support of more than 100,000 steel workers of An'gang for the Japanese people's just struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. He said that if the imperialist warmongers dare to launch a war, we will mercilessly, resolutely, thoroughly, and completely eliminate them.

The conference concluded with the reading of a telegram from people from all walks of life in Anshan supporting the Japanese people's opposition to the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. After the meeting, 500,000 people held a massive demonstration.

    反对美帝国主义和日本军国主义的意志坚似钢铁
    鞍山五十万人大示威支持日本人民斗争
    钢铁工人说：帝国主义胆敢发动战争就把它坚决彻底全部消灭掉
    据新华社鞍山18日电　钢都鞍山五十万人民今天下午举行了规模空前的集会和示威游行，坚决支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的正义斗争。
    鞍山市人民特别是钢铁工人，饱受日本帝国主义压榨、掠夺和法西斯统治达三十年之久。从1915年，日本帝国主义伸出魔爪，掠夺鞍山的铁矿资源开始，鞍山的工人首先遭受了日本帝国主义的压榨和剥削。1931年“九一八”事变、日本帝国主义强占东北以后，鞍山市人民和广大工人更直接在日寇铁蹄下过着水深火热的苦难生活，一直到1945年抗日战争胜利。在这三十多年的漫长岁月里，几乎天天都有许多中国工人死亡，仅1944年一年，就被日本法西斯强盗害死一千九百多人，大孤山铁矿一次大爆炸，就炸死工人七十二人。鞍山人民和钢铁工人对日本帝国主义的滔天罪行记忆犹新，所以当今天美日反动派又策划新的侵略战争阴谋时，立即激起他们的极大愤慨和坚决反对。
    今天下午两点多钟，愤怒的人们就从鞍钢的高炉上、平炉前和轧钢机旁，从全市的各个街道，向市中心广场——胜利广场汇集。他们挥舞着旗帜，抬着巨幅标语牌，振臂高呼“反对复活日本军国主义”、“反对日美军事同盟条约”等口号。参加大会的人数本来预计是四十万人，可是实际到会的超过了五十万。中共鞍山市委第一书记杨士杰等党政领导人，和各部门、各人民团体的负责人参加了大会。参加大会的还有苏联驻鞍山的专家和越南的实习生。
    大会开始后，中共鞍山市委第一书记杨士杰首先讲话。他代表全市人民表示坚决支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的正义斗争，对日本人民在斗争中所取得的重大成就表示衷心祝贺，并预祝日本人民在第十六次全国统一行动中取得更大的胜利。他说，我们决不能坐视美日反动派互相勾结，梦想重走以前的侵略老路，企图重新压迫和奴役我国人民。我们要正告美帝国主义和岸信介集团，时代已经变了，帝国主义为所欲为的日子已经一去不复返了。已经解放了的中国人民，完全有信心有力量粉碎美帝国主义对我国的任何挑衅。谁要是胆敢把新的战争强加在中国人民头上，谁就一定碰得头破血流。
    接着，各人民团体的负责人，和工人、农民、城市人民公社的代表先后在会上讲了话。全国著名劳动模范、鞍钢炼铁厂副厂长孟泰在讲话中，表达了鞍钢十多万钢铁工人对日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的正义斗争的坚决支持。他说，如果帝国主义好战分子胆敢发动战争，我们就毫不留情地把它坚决、彻底、全部消灭掉。
    大会最后宣读了鞍山市各界人民支援日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的通电。会后，五十万人民举行了声势浩大的示威游行。
