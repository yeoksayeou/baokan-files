    Hebei and Yunnan Launch Nationwide Drought Resistance Campaign
    (Our report) Hebei Province's industrial transportation, finance and trade, and culture and education systems have further established the idea of taking agriculture as the foundation. Under the unified leadership of party committees at all levels, they have launched an unprecedented mass movement centered on "fighting drought and eliminating drought" to support the great leap forward in agriculture. As of the end of April, nearly ten million people from all walks of life in large and small cities and towns across the province, including industry, commerce, students, soldiers, men and women, young and old, have directly participated in and done a good job in their own business to support the drought resistance struggle.
    With the continuous development of the drought situation, the mass movement to support agricultural drought resistance in all walks of life in Hebei Province has become more widespread and in-depth. Large and medium-sized machinery factories and small agricultural machinery manufacturing and repair factories in various counties throughout the province have actively responded to agricultural needs, linked up with communes, and worked with commune-run industries to carry out a great overproduction competition in the production of powered irrigation and drainage machinery to support the agricultural drought resistance struggle. By mid-April, they had rushed to produce 130,000 horsepower of various powered irrigation and drainage machinery and more than 13,000 kilowatts of electric motors; and innovated, created, and remodeled more than 156,000 pieces of water lifting tools. The industrial departments of the province also sent more than 100,000 outstanding technicians to various people's communes to rush to repair irrigation and drainage and other agricultural machinery. The commercial departments of the province also linked up with the communes, organized 60,000 employees and more than 8,000 trucks to carry out supply activities to deliver goods to the communes, teams, and square fields, and timely supply the materials needed for drought resistance. By mid-April, the total value of production material supplies increased by 87.28% compared with the same period last year, of which the supply of complete sets of powered irrigation and drainage machinery increased by 1.4 times compared with the same period last year. In supporting the drought resistance struggle, the science and technology departments have greatly promoted technology popularization. According to incomplete statistics from the province, since last winter, science and technology commissions and associations in various places have held more than 52,000 training courses for rural areas. Zhangjiakou alone trained more than 100,000 technical personnel for communes, such as drivers, machinists, and electricians, which strongly supported the drought resistance struggle. Other industries have also done their best to support the drought resistance struggle. Three municipal hospitals, twelve county (district) hospitals, and one hundred and twenty-four commune hospitals in the Tangshan area have linked up, and medical personnel have gone deep into the square fields for mobile medical treatment, ensuring that the vast number of commune members are energetic and healthy in the drought resistance movement.
    (Our report) More than 5 million commune members in Yunnan Province have invested in fighting drought and seizing the time to plant. At present, the province has planted more than 21 million mu of major spring crops, more than double the speed of the same period last year. Among them, the transplanting of early rice has been completed, and the area has expanded by more than two times compared with last year. The transplanting of mid-season rice has already begun. More than 9.3 million mu of corn have been planted, completing 68% of the planned number; the planting of sweet potatoes has also basically ended.
    The planting of major spring crops on the Yunnan Plateau, under the threat of continuous drought for more than 170 days, has ensured the timely, high-quality, and quantitative sowing of various major spring crops due to the result of the people of all ethnic groups competing with the sky for water. Ninety-eight communes in the Wenshan Zhuang and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, through the "creating ten thousand wells, ten thousand ponds, ten thousand ditches, and ten thousand dams" campaign, have added more than 220,000 mu of planting water for the whole prefecture. The Yuxi Special Zone has greatly developed irrigation and drainage machinery, installing more than 6,000 animal-powered waterwheels along the lake, which are continuously pumping water to farmland day and night. Due to the abundance of water sources, it has achieved full water, sufficient fertilizer, flat fields, and mud liquefaction. In the Qujing Special Zone, the "three tides" sowing is promoted in the sowing of corn: first dig a pit, water, then sow, cover with fertilizer, cover with river sand, grass coal, etc. to maintain moisture, and organize drought-resistant watering to protect seedlings. Now the emergence rate of more than 660,000 mu of corn that has been sown in the whole district has reached 90%.
    Currently, the drought situation in the province continues to develop. The Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to mobilize all forces to overcome the drought and win a bumper harvest. It has also decided to expand the originally planned 10 million mu of high-yield fields to 20 million mu, and strive to increase the area of rice with a yield of more than 800 jin per mu by more than five times compared with last year; to increase the area of corn with a yield of more than 600 jin per mu by more than three times compared with last year, and the average yield per mu of 1 million mu of sweet potatoes should reach 5,000 jin.

    河北云南全民抗旱
    本报讯　河北省工业交通、财贸、文教三大系统，进一步树立以农业为基础的思想，在各级党委的统一领导下，开展了一个规模空前的以“抗旱灭旱”为中心的支援农业大跃进的群众运动。截至4月末，全省大小城镇的工商学兵、各行各业、男女老少，直接参加和搞好本身业务工作支援抗旱斗争的人数已达近千万人。
    随着旱象的不断发展，河北省各行各业支援农业抗旱的群众运动更加广泛深入。全省各大中型机械厂和各县小型农业机具制造厂、修配厂，纷纷围绕农业需要，与公社联系挂钩，和社办工业一道，开展了动力排灌机械生产大超产竞赛，支援农业抗旱斗争。到4月中旬，已赶制出各种动力排灌机械十三万马力，电动机一万三千多瓩；革新创造和改制提水工具十五万六千余件。全省工业部门还派出十多万优秀技工，为各地人民公社抢修排灌等农业机械。全省商业部门也和公社挂了钩，组织了六万职工，八千多辆货车，开展了送货到社、到队、到方田的供应活动，及时供应抗旱所需的物资。到4月中旬生产资料供应总值比去年同期提高87.28％，其中成套动力排灌机械的供应量比去年同期增加了一点四倍。科学技术部门在支援抗旱斗争中，大搞技术普及，据全省不完全统计，去冬以来，各地科委、科协共为农村举办训练班五万二千多期。张家口一地即为公社培训了司机手，机工、电工等技术人才十万余名，有力地支持了抗旱斗争。其它行业也都各尽其力地支援抗旱斗争。唐山地区三个市级医院、十二个县（区）级医院和一百二十四个公社医院挂了钩，医务人员深入方田巡回医疗，保障了广大社员在抗旱运动中精力充沛，身体健康。
    本报讯　云南省五百多万个社员投入抗旱抢种，目前，全省已经种下大春作物两千一百多万亩，比去年同期快一倍多。其中，早稻栽插已经完成，面积比去年扩大两倍以上。中稻已开始插秧。玉米种下九百三十多万亩，完成计划数的68％；薯类种植也已经基本结束。
    云南高原的大春栽种，在一百七十多天持续干旱的威胁下，由于各族人民与天争水的结果，保证了各种大春作物按时、按质、按量播种。文山僮族苗族自治州九十八个公社，通过“造万井、万塘、万沟、万坝”运动，全州新增加了二十二万多亩栽种用水。玉溪专区大搞排灌机械，沿湖安装了六千多部畜力水车，日夜不停的向农田车水。由于水源充沛，做到了水饱肥足，田平泥化。曲靖专区在播种玉米中，推行“三潮”播种：先打塘、浇水，然后下种、盖肥、盖河沙、草煤等保持水份，并组织抗旱浇水保苗，现在全区已经下种的六十六万多亩玉米，出苗率达90％。
    当前，全省旱象继续发展，中共云南省委决定调动一切力量，战胜干旱夺取大丰收。并决定将原来计划的一千万亩高产田扩大为两千万亩，力争使亩产八百斤以上的水稻面积比去年增加五倍多；使亩产六百斤以上的玉米面积比去年增加三倍多，一百万亩红薯平均亩产五千斤。
