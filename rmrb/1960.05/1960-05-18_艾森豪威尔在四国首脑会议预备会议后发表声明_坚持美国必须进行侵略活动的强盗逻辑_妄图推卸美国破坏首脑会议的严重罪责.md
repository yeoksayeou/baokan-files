Xinhua News Agency, 17th dispatch: The United States Information Service released on the 16th a statement by U.S. President Eisenhower made on the same day after the preparatory meeting of the four-power government heads, the full text of which follows:

After General de Gaulle and Prime Minister Macmillan told me yesterday about the attitude that Mr. Khrushchev adopted towards this meeting when he visited them yesterday morning, I very carefully considered the most appropriate way to handle this matter. Considering the enormous importance of this meeting and the hopes that people all over the world have placed on it, I determined that under the present circumstances, it would be best to see if there was any possibility in today's closed meeting of using reason and self-restraint to handle this overflight incident, so that the meeting could continue.

I had no illusions about the possibility of any such attitude succeeding, but I felt that, given the grave responsibility I bear as President of the United States, such an effort should be made.

In this regard, I received the strongest support from my colleagues, President de Gaulle and Prime Minister Macmillan. Therefore, at this morning's closed meeting, despite the strong and inaccurate nature of Mr. Khrushchev's statement, I replied to him as follows:

I was forewarned about the significance of the statement just read by Premier Khrushchev.

In my statement of May 11 and Secretary of State Herter's statement of May 9, the United States' attitude towards the unpleasant necessity of espionage in a world of mutual distrust between nations has been explained. We pointed out that these activities had no intention of aggression, but were to safeguard the security of the United States and the free world from a surprise attack by a country that boasted it could destroy the United States and other countries with missiles equipped with nuclear warheads. As is well known, not only the United States, but also most other countries, have been the target of constant and deliberate espionage by the Soviet Union.

In the Soviet statement, there is clearly a misunderstanding on a key issue. The Soviet statement said that the United States had threatened through some official statements to continue overflights. The importance of this so-called threat has been emphasized and repeated by Mr. Khrushchev. The United States has not issued any such threat. Neither I nor my government has ever intended to do so. The actual statement only said that the United States would not shirk its responsibility to defend against surprise attacks. In fact, these flights have been stopped since the recent incident and will not be resumed. Therefore, this cannot be a matter of dispute.

I came to Paris to seek some agreement with the Soviet Union that would eliminate the need for espionage in all its forms, including overflights. I see no reason to use this incident to derail this meeting.

If it proves impossible to address this issue and other major issues threatening world peace here in Paris because of the Soviet attitude, I plan to make a recommendation to the United Nations in the near future to establish United Nations aerial surveillance to detect preparations for attacks. I had intended to present this plan to this meeting. This surveillance system will be implemented on the territory of all countries willing to accept such inspections. As far as the United States is concerned, it is not only prepared to accept United Nations aerial surveillance, but also to contribute its full strength to the rapid organization and successful implementation of such international surveillance.

We Americans came here to sincerely consider the major issues facing this meeting. We are prepared either to discontinue talking about this issue or to hold bilateral talks between the United States and the Soviet Union while the main conference proceeds.

My speech was endorsed and supported by my Western colleagues, who also asked Mr. Khrushchev to follow the path of reason and common sense and forget about propaganda. Such an attitude would allow the meeting to proceed. I made it very clear to Mr. Khrushchev that for the United States, his ultimatum was absolutely unacceptable.

Mr. Khrushchev brushed aside all reasonable arguments, and he not only insisted on this ultimatum, but also insisted that he would publish the full text of his statement at a time of his own choosing. This clearly shows his determination to sabotage the Paris Conference.

In fact, the only conclusion that can be drawn from his actions this morning is that his sole intention in traveling all the way from Moscow to Paris was to sabotage this meeting, on which the whole world placed great hope.

Despite this serious and unfavorable development, I have no intention of reducing my continued efforts to promote a just peace. This will be the case for the remainder of my stay in Paris, and in the days that follow.

    艾森豪威尔在四国首脑会议预备会议后发表声明
    坚持美国必须进行侵略活动的强盗逻辑
    妄图推卸美国破坏首脑会议的严重罪责
    新华社17日讯　美国新闻处16日发表了美国总统艾森豪威尔当天在四国政府首脑会议预备会议结束后发表的声明，全文如下：
    在昨天戴高乐将军和麦克米伦首相把赫鲁晓夫先生昨天上午拜访他们时对这次会议所采取的态度告诉了我之后，我极其谨慎地考虑了处理这件事情的最恰当的方法。由于考虑到这次会议的巨大的重要性以及全世界人民对这次会议寄予的希望，我认定，在目前情况下，最好还是看一下，在今天的秘密会议上是否存在着运用理智和自制力来处理这个越界飞行事件，从而使会议得以进行下去的任何可能性。
    对于任何这种态度获得成功的可能性问题，我并不抱有幻想，但是我认为，鉴于我作为美国总统所肩负的重大责任，应该作这样的努力。
    在这方面，我得到了我的同僚戴高乐总统和麦克米伦首相的最有力的支持。因此，在今天上午的秘密会议上，尽管赫鲁晓夫先生的声明是强烈的和不确切的，我对他作了如下的答复：
    我事先已经得悉了赫鲁晓夫总理刚才所宣读的声明的意义。
    在我的5月11日的声明以及赫脱国务卿5月9日的声明中，已经说明了美国对于在一个国与国之间彼此不信任对方的意图的世界上进行间谍活动这种不愉快的必要措施的态度。我们指出，这些活动并没有侵略的意图，而是为了保障美国和自由世界的安全，使它们免受一个夸耀自己能用装置着原子弹头的导弹摧毁美国和其他国家的国家的突袭。如所周知，不仅美国，而且其他大多数国家也一直是苏联不断进行蓄意的间谍活动的目标。
    在苏联的声明中，对于一个关键问题显然有误解。苏联的声明说，美国已经通过一些官方声明威胁要继续进行越界飞行。这种所谓威胁的重要性已经由赫鲁晓夫先生强调和重复说过了。美国并没有发出过这种威胁。无论是我或者我的政府都没有打算过这样做。实际的声明只是说，美国不会规避自己的防范突袭的责任。事实上，这些飞行在最近的事件发生后已经停止了，而且将不恢复。因此，这不能成为争论问题。
    我到巴黎来是为了寻求同苏联取得一些将能消除进行包括越界飞行在内的一切方式的间谍活动的必要性的协议。我认为没有理由利用这一事件来使这次会议垮台。
    如果事实证明，由于苏联的态度，不可能在巴黎这里处理这个问题和其他威胁世界和平的重大问题的话，我计划在不久的将来向联合国提出一项关于建立联合国的空中监视来侦察进攻准备的建议。我曾经打算向这次会议提出这个计划。这种监视制度将在一切准备接受这种视察的国家的领土上实施。就美国方面而言，它不但准备接受联合国的空中监视，而且准备尽自己的一切力量对迅速地组织和成功地实施这种国际监视作出贡献。
    我们美国人到这里来是为了真诚地考虑这次会议所面临的重大问题的。我们准备或者不再继续谈这个问题，或者在主要会议进行的同时由美国和苏联举行双边会谈。
    我的讲话得到我的西方同僚们的赞同和支持，他们也要求赫鲁晓夫先生遵循理智和常识的途径，并忘掉宣传。这样一种态度将使会议得以进行。我极其明确地向赫鲁晓夫先生表示，对美国来说，他的最后通牒是绝对不能接受的。
    赫鲁晓夫先生把一切理智的论点撇在一边，他不仅坚持这种最后通牒，而且还坚持他将在他自己所选择的时候公布他的声明全文。这就明显地表明他决心破坏巴黎会议。
    事实上，从他今天上午的行动中可以得出的唯一的结论是，他从莫斯科远道来到巴黎的唯一意图是破坏这次全世界寄予很大希望的会议。
    尽管有了这种严重的和不利的事态发展，我丝毫也不打算减少我继续为促进正义的和平而进行的努力。在我停留在巴黎的其余的日子里，以及在以后的日子里，将都是这样。
