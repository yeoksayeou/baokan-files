Since the General Political Department issued the "Instructions on Popularizing Secondary and Higher Education among Cadres" in January 1959, more than a year has passed. In this year, the scale and speed of cultural and educational development in our army, as well as the achievements and experiences gained, have far surpassed any previous year. This is a Great Leap Forward. This Great Leap Forward has created a good start and laid a solid foundation for realizing the "Ten-Year Plan" of popularizing secondary and higher education in our army.

Our army is a completely new type of people's army with lofty communist ideals, under the direct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao. Attaching importance to cultural education is a fine tradition of our army and an important part of Chairman Mao's theory on army building. With the rapid development of industry, science, and technology in our country, the modernization of our army is increasing, and the role of cultural education in the modernization of our army is becoming more and more important. Since 1959, cultural learning in the troops has rapidly formed a magnificent and continuously leaping mass movement. This movement has progressed rapidly and achieved great success, and has accumulated rich experience in ideological leadership, organizational leadership, and teaching, finding a way to rapidly improve the cultural level of our army in a way that is more, faster, better, and more economical.

In the past year, there have been many experiences in various aspects of the cultural learning movement in our army, but to sum up, the most fundamental point is that popularizing secondary and higher education must become a continuous mass movement. Starting from this basic point, I would like to focus on the following four aspects: continuously strengthening political and ideological work is the fundamental guarantee for realizing the "Ten-Year Plan"; we must adapt to the characteristics of on-the-job cadre learning and take practical and feasible measures; we must correctly handle the relationship between basic knowledge and practical application, and between secondary education and higher education; we must strengthen teaching leadership and continuously improve the quality of teaching.

Generally speaking, it is not difficult to learn culture with one burst of energy, but it is not so easy to persevere. Therefore, whether or not we can persevere for a long time has become the key to popularizing secondary and higher education among all army cadres. Because: first, the participants are a large team including all army cadres, and we need to solve the cultural problems of all army cadres; second, the learning goal is a relatively long-term one, and reaching this goal requires a long journey; third, completing such a large learning task mainly relies on on-the-job learning, rather than off-the-job learning. These characteristics determine that the work of popularizing secondary and higher education is a complex and arduous task. Only through strong political and ideological work, so that the vast number of cadres have lofty ambitions, indomitable revolutionary will, and the determination to persevere to the end, can the continuous development of this movement be guaranteed. The practice of cultural education in the past year has proved that the process of launching and adhering to the popularization of secondary and higher education is the process of strengthening ideological work, which is also the process of continuous ideological struggle. Whether or not one can learn depends on ideological mobilization, and on determination and drive. As long as political and ideological work is done well, all troops can be involved in this learning movement in various situations and under different conditions. Cultural and educational work, like other work, is a major factor in promoting work progress once certain objective conditions are met.

To make learning start and persist, it is also necessary to adapt to the characteristics of on-the-job cadre learning and take practical and feasible measures. In the past year of learning movement, our army has gradually formed a set of good methods in this regard. This set of methods is: "On-the-job learning is the main method, supplemented by intensive training; unified leadership, classified management; running large, medium, and small schools at the same time, organizing cadres with various organizational forms according to their existing cultural level and work situation, and putting forward different progress and different requirements according to different situations." This set of methods can both take care of the majority, fully mobilize, and widely implement the mass line; and is conducive to organizing various cadres separately, adhering to long-term learning, and moving towards the common goal of popularizing secondary and higher education at different paces.

With on-the-job learning as the main method, in terms of teaching organization and teaching methods, we must be good at adapting to changes in work tasks, being able to scale up or down, combine or separate. If the garrison is concentrated, classes are held in units of battalion or regiment; if the garrison is scattered, classes are held in units of company. Construction troops "run schools at different points" and "take classes in shifts"; people's armed cadres "attack in bureaus and consolidate in townships"; naval and border defense troops, teachers "deliver classes to the door" and students "representatives receive classes"; office cadres go to the troops, and the work team is the study group, "people are scattered but the group is not scattered, and learning runs through the line," etc., are all feasible methods. However, no matter which method is used, it is necessary to emphasize unified leadership, classified management, rooting in companies (office departments), and implementing plans. Only in this way can we ensure quality and facilitate long-term adherence.

The contradiction between learning and work, and between cultural learning and other learning in terms of time, must be constantly resolved. A good way to solve this contradiction is: first, work and learning are "one game of chess," with comprehensive arrangements and timely adjustments. Grasp both work and learning; have both annual arrangements and temporary arrangements. Not only arrange time, but also arrange personnel. This arrangement should be done from the Party committee to the branch, and individual cadres should also "implement plans." Second, in terms of learning time, adopt a combination of regular learning and intensive learning, and a combination of steady flow and large and small climaxes. Learn more in slack times and less in busy times. Third, vigorously encourage cadres to find time on their own, gather fragments into wholes, and accumulate small amounts into large amounts.

Cadres often go out and have high mobility, often missing classes, which is a significant feature of on-the-job learning. If the learning problems of cadres who go out are not solved, it will inevitably interrupt the learning of a large number of cadres. The main way to solve this problem is, in addition to the vast number of cadres developing self-study habits, the leadership must make proper arrangements for the work and study of cadres who go out. Those who go out individually carry learning tasks, those who go out with several people form study groups, and those who go out in batches run "temporary schools." Put forward different learning requirements according to different outward situations. Strive to make up for missed classes upon return. Complete the learning tasks of the current season and year in the current season and year.

Because most of our army's cadres are of worker and peasant origin, with a very weak cultural foundation, it is necessary to make up for necessary basic knowledge in order to solve cultural problems. The cultural education we are conducting is not a short-term task, but a long-term plan from primary to advanced, from popularizing secondary education to popularizing higher education. Therefore, in teaching work, attention must be paid to the combination of basic knowledge and practical application, and the combination of secondary courses and higher courses. This combination should be reflected both in the arrangement of the "Ten-Year Plan" and in the specific teaching work of each stage and each unit. The secondary courses we have stipulated reduce the general knowledge that our army cadres do not need very much, and increase the urgently needed content, so that cadres have the minimum basic knowledge. Some basic knowledge, although its role cannot be seen for a while, is a necessary foundation for professional knowledge. Laying this foundation well will make professional knowledge easier to learn and easier to master. Practice in the past year has also proved that, in order to more closely integrate the different businesses and practical applications of on-the-job cadres, in the future, the content closely related to the modernization of our army should be greatly increased; the teaching order can be "learn what is urgently needed first"; and the learning content of each course can also be emphasized differently according to the different needs of various business cadres. So as to create conditions for their respective development towards higher education in the stage of secondary education.

One of the most important issues in on-the-job cadre cultural education is the continuous improvement of teaching quality. The main experiences in this regard are: First, vigorously carry out self-study activities and cultivate cadres' self-study habits. This is the most important mass foundation for ensuring teaching quality. The process of continuous improvement of teaching quality in our army in the past year is also the process of continuous expansion of the cadre self-study team and gradual formation of self-study habits. Practice has proved that only by carrying out the self-study movement, so that the vast number of cadres develop the habit of long-term self-study, can the problem of improving quality in on-the-job cadre cultural education be thoroughly solved. Second, organizing and cultivating a strong teaching staff is an important link in improving teaching quality. In order to continuously enrich and strengthen the teaching staff and adapt to the needs of cultural learning development, first of all, the leadership should regard whether or not to seriously cultivate teachers as a manifestation of whether or not there is a determination to implement the "Ten-Year Plan" in ideological terms. In the past year, with the vigorous development of cultural and educational work, the entire army has formed a teaching staff of tens of thousands of people, including full-time and part-time teachers, providing an important guarantee for our army to carry out mass cultural learning movements. The formation of this teaching staff is inseparable from our adoption of a mass line solution to the teacher problem, which is "high teaching low, those who are able are teachers," and "full-time teachers are the backbone, and part-time teachers are the main body." The superior conditions of part-time teachers are: they generally work in this unit and department, are familiar with the situation of students, are familiar with the business of this line, are easy to teach students according to their aptitude, and combine learning and application; they are also easy to carry out teaching activities anytime and anywhere. Third, leading cadres personally grasp teaching, which is an important guarantee for improving teaching quality. Leading cadres personally grasping teaching can do ideological work and organizational work together, strengthen political command and organizational leadership; it is easy to combine with work, so that education is more likely to be linked to reality; the head's hands-on can encourage everyone's enthusiasm, and it is also easy to solve practical problems encountered in learning. Last year, some leading cadres greatly grasped cultural education, went deep into a school and a class, conducted investigations and research, acted as both teachers and students, attended classes with the class, participated in lesson preparation, organized teaching research, etc., which are effective methods to change the face of cultural education and improve teaching quality, and should be vigorously promoted in the future.

In the past year, our army's work in popularizing secondary and higher education among cadres has achieved remarkable results and rich experience. This is the victory of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the victory of Mao Zedong Thought, and the victory of the continuous mass movement. In the future, we must continue to work hard, better implement the Party's education policy, better use advanced teaching experience, and actively and gradually complete the task of popularizing secondary and higher education in accordance with the "Ten-Year Plan" of the General Political Department for popularizing secondary and higher education among cadres. At present, our country's socialist construction is proceeding at a high speed, and the modernization of our army is developing by leaps and bounds. The situation is very favorable to us. Let us, on the basis of the victory of the past year, hold high the red banner of the general line and Mao Zedong Thought even higher, and strive to victoriously complete the task of popularizing secondary and higher education, and to accelerate the construction of our army into an excellent modernized revolutionary army, and better undertake the great historical task of defending the socialist construction of the motherland and defending peace in the Far East and the world!

    普及中、高等教育是一个持续不断的群众运动
    萧华上将在解放军文教积极分子代表大会上的报告（摘要）
    自从1959年1月总政治部发布“关于在干部中普及中等教育和高等教育的指示”以来，已经过去一年多的时间。这一年，我军文化教育发展的规模和速度，取得的成就和经验，都远远超过了以往任何的一年。这是一个大跃进。这个大跃进，为实现我军普及中、高等教育的“十年大计”创造了良好的开端，奠定了胜利的基础。
    我们的军队，是在党和毛主席直接领导下的、具有崇高的共产主义理想的完全新型的人民军队。重视文化教育是我军的优良传统，是毛主席关于人民军队建设的一项重要内容。随着我国工业和科学技术的飞跃发展，我军的现代化程度越来越高，文化教育在我军现代化建设中的作用也越来越重要。1959年以来，部队的文化学习迅速形成了规模壮阔、持续跃进的群众运动。这个运动，进展迅速，成绩很大，并且在思想领导、组织领导、教学业务等方面，积累了丰富的经验，为迅速提高我军的文化水平，找到了一条多、快、好、省的道路。
    一年来，我军文化学习运动各个方面的经验很多，但归纳起来，最根本的一点，就是普及中、高等教育，必须成为持续不断的群众运动。从这样一个基本点出发，我想着重谈以下四个方面的问题。这就是：不断加强政治思想工作是实现“十年大计”的根本保证；必须适应在职干部学习的特点，采取切实可行的措施；必须正确处理基础知识与实际应用之间、中等教育与高等教育之间的关系；必须加强教学领导，不断地提高教学质量。
    一般说来，文化学习，一鼓作气并不难，但要持之以恒，就并不那么容易。因此，能否长期坚持，就成为在全军干部中普及中、高等教育的关键。因为：第一，参加学习的是包括全军干部在内的一个大队伍，我们要解决的是全军干部的文化问题；第二，学习要达到的是一个比较长远的目标，达到这个目标要经历一段较长的路程；第三，完成这样大的学习任务，又主要是依靠在职学习，而不是依靠离职学习。这些特点规定了普及中、高等教育的工作，是一项复杂的艰巨的任务。只有经过坚强的政治思想工作，使广大干部具有雄心壮志，具有百折不挠的革命毅力和坚持到底的决心，才能使这一运动的持续发展获得最基本的保证。去年一年文化教育的实践证明，普及中、高等教育的发动和坚持的过程，就是加强思想工作的过程，也就是不断地进行思想斗争的过程。能不能学的问题，关键在于思想发动，在于决心和干劲。只要把政治思想工作作好，就能够使一切部队在各种不同情况和不同的条件下，都卷入到这个学习运动中来。文化教育工作，也和其它工作一样，在具备了一定的客观条件之后，人的主观能动性就是推动工作前进的一个重大因素。
    要使学习开展起来并且坚持下去，还必须适应在职干部学习的特点，采取切实可行的措施。去年一年的学习运动，我军已经逐步地在这方面形成了一套好办法。这套办法是：“在职学习为主，集训为辅；统一领导，分级管理；大、中、小学并举，按照干部现有的文化程度和工作情况，用各种组织形式，分别组织起来，根据不同情况提出不同进度、不同要求。”这套办法，既可以照顾多数，全面动员，广泛地贯彻群众路线；也利于把各种干部分别组织起来，长期坚持学习，用不同的步伐，朝着普及中、高等教育的共同目标迈进。
    以在职学习为主，在教学组织、教学方式上，必须善于适应工作任务的变化，可大可小，可分可合。驻地集中就以营或团为单位上课，驻地分散就以连为单位上课。施工部队“分点办校”、“轮班上课”；人民武装干部“在局突击，下乡巩固”；海陆边防部队，教员“送课上门”，学员“代表领课”；机关干部下部队，工作组就是学习组，“人散组不散，学习一线穿”，等等，都是可行的方法。但是，不论那一种方法，都必须强调统一领导，分级管理，连队（机关部门）扎根，计划落户。这样，才能保证质量和便于长期坚持。
    学习与工作、文化学习与其它学习在时间上的矛盾，必须不断地加以解决。解决这个矛盾的好方法是：第一，工作学习“一盘棋”，全面安排，及时调整。既抓工作，又抓学习；既有年度安排，又有临时布置。不仅要安排时间，也要安排人员。这种安排，从党委到支部都要做，干部个人也要“计划落户”。第二，在学习时间上，采取经常学习与突击学习相结合，细水长流与大小高潮相结合。闲时多学，忙时少学。第三，大力提倡干部自己找时间，聚零为整，积少成多。
    干部外出多，流动性大，常常缺课，是在职学习的一个显著特点。如果外出干部的学习问题不解决，势必使大量干部的学习中断。解决这个问题的主要办法是，除了广大干部养成自学习惯以外，领导上对外出干部的工作和学习必须妥善安排。个别外出的带学习任务，几个人一道外出的组成学习小组，成批外出的办“临时学校”。按照不同的外出情况，提出不同的学习要求。回来时，力求做到缺课必补。当季、当年的学习任务，当季、当年完成。
    由于我军干部大多数是工农出身，文化底子很薄，为了解决文化问题，必须补习必要的基础知识。我们所进行的文化教育，又不是一个短暂的工作，而是从初级到高级，从普及中等教育到普及高等教育的长远规划。因此，在教学工作中，必须注意基础知识和实际应用、中等课程和高等课程之间的结合。这种结合，既要体现在“十年大计”的安排上，又要体现在每个阶段、每个单位具体的教学工作中。我们规定的中学课程，削减了我军干部不十分需要的一般知识，增加了迫切需要的内容，以便使干部具备起码的基础知识。有些基础知识，虽然一时还看不到它的作用，但却是专业知识的必要基础。打好这个基础，专业知识就容易学、容易掌握。一年来的实践还证明，为了更加紧密地结合在职干部不同的业务和实际的应用，今后，应该大大增加与我军现代化建设密切联系的内容；教学顺序上可以“急用先学”；各门课的学习内容也可按照各种业务干部不同的需要有所侧重。以便在中等教育的阶段，就为各自向高等教育发展创造条件。
    在职干部文化教育中一个最为重要的问题是不断地提高教学质量的问题。这方面的主要经验是：第一、大力开展自学活动，培养干部的自学习惯，这是保证教学质量最重要的群众基础。一年来，我军教学质量不断提高的过程，也就是干部自学队伍不断扩大、自学习惯逐渐养成的过程。实践证明，只有把自学运动开展起来，使广大干部养成长期自学的习惯，才能彻底解决在职干部文化教育中提高质量的问题。第二、组织和培养一支坚强的教员队伍，是提高教学质量的一个重要环节。为了不断充实和加强教员队伍，适应文化学习发展的需要，首先领导思想上要把是否认真培养教员的工作，看作是有无决心贯彻“十年大计”的一个表现。一年来，随着文化教育工作的蓬勃发展，全军组成了一支包括专职和兼职教员在内的几万人的教员队伍，为我军开展群众性的文化学习运动提供了重要的保证。这支教员队伍的形成，是和我们采用了“以高教低，能者为师”、“以专职教员为骨干，以兼职教员为主体”，这样一套群众路线的解决师资问题的办法分不开的。兼职教员的优越条件是：他们一般都在本单位、本部门工作，熟悉学员的情况，熟悉本行的业务，便于因人施教，学用结合；也便于随时随地地进行教学活动。第三、领导干部亲自抓教学，是提高教学质量的重要保证。领导干部亲自抓教学，可以思想工作、组织工作一起作，加强政治挂帅和组织领导；便于结合工作，使教育更可能联系实际；首长动手能鼓舞大家的干劲，也便于解决学习中所遇到的实际问题。去年，有些领导干部大抓文化教育，深入一校一班，进行调查研究，既当先生，又当学生，跟班听课，参加备课，组织教学研究等等，都是改变文化教育面貌，提高教学质量的有效方法，今后应大力提倡。
    过去的一年，我军在干部中普及中、高等教育的工作成绩是显著的，经验是丰富的。这是党的社会主义建设总路线的胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利，是持续不断的群众运动的胜利。今后，必须再接再厉，更好地贯彻党的教育方针，更好地运用先进的教学经验，按照总政在干部中普及中、高等教育的“十年大计”，积极地、逐步地完成普及中、高等教育的任务。目前，我国社会主义建设，正在高速度地进行，我军的现代化建设正在飞跃发展。形势对我们非常有利。让我们在过去一年胜利的基础上，更高地举起总路线和毛泽东思想的红旗，为胜利完成普及中、高等教育的任务，为加速把我军建设成为一支优良的现代化革命军队，更好地担负起保卫祖国社会主义建设事业，保卫远东与世界和平的伟大历史任务而奋勇前进！
