(Reported by TASS, Moscow, May 7) Comrade Khrushchev's detailed summary of his closing remarks at the Supreme Soviet session on May 7, 1960, is as follows:

Comrade Deputies! The U.S. aircraft's aggressive act against the Soviet Union has aroused justified anger among the deputies and all the Soviet people. The session and the Soviet government have received many inquiries and letters. Therefore, allow me to address this issue again and cite some new information.

After I reported to the Supreme Soviet and announced this fact, the U.S. State Department issued an official statement to the press, insisting that the U.S. "Lockheed U-2" aircraft that violated the Soviet border was supposedly conducting climate research in the atmosphere near the Turkish-Soviet border. It claimed that the aircraft became disoriented due to a pilot oxygen supply malfunction. The State Department insisted that the pilot lost consciousness and the aircraft, controlled by autopilot, flew into Soviet territory. According to the State Department, the pilot only had time to notify his departure airport in Adana, Turkey, about the oxygen equipment failure, and this airport was said to be not a military airport but belonged to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration immediately issued a statement attempting to confirm the State Department's claims. The statement said:

"A 'U-2' aircraft belonging to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, used for scientific research to study high-altitude atmospheric conditions and gusts since 1956, has been missing since 9:00 a.m. local time on May 1st after its pilot reported oxygen difficulties over Lake Van in Turkey."

Comrades! I should tell you a secret. When I made the report, I deliberately did not say that the pilot was alive and well, and that the wreckage of the plane was here with us. (Laughter. Sustained applause.) We did this on purpose, because if we had revealed everything at once, the Americans would have concocted another story. (Laughter in the hall. Applause.)

But now you see how much nonsense they've said – Lake Van, scientific research, and so on.

Now that they know the pilot is alive, they have to come up with something else. And they will think of... (Laughter in the hall, applause.)

The statement also said:

"The aircraft took off from the Incirlik Air Base in Adana, Turkey. The flight plan stipulated that the first monitoring point was at coordinates 37 degrees 25 minutes north latitude and 41 degrees 23 minutes east longitude, then a left turn to the radio beacon on Lake Van, then to the radio beacons of Trabzon and Antalya, and return to Adana." This is the "precise" material they announced. I will talk about what actually happened later.

"The flight should have lasted three hours and forty-five minutes, during which the aircraft should have flown one thousand four hundred nautical miles. The aircraft took off at 8:00 a.m. local time. Approximately one hour after takeoff, the pilot reported that the oxygen equipment had failed. He notified on a radio wave dedicated to accidents that he was steering the aircraft towards the Lake Van radio beacon in order to obtain a bearing and then return to Adana."

The statement continued: "As mentioned earlier, according to the flight plan, he should have turned left at the Lake Van radio beacon. According to his last notification, he intended to receive the signal from this radio beacon. It is estimated that he may have flown a northeast route, but contact with him was then lost.

Search was immediately started after receiving his last notification. The terrain in the Lake Van area is mountainous." Saying that the Lake Van area is mountainous is correct.

"No signs of a plane crash were found." This is also correct, because the plane did not crash there at all.

The statement then detailed what instruments the plane was equipped with and what "peaceful" purposes it held. Please allow me to quote another passage:

"The instruments installed on the 'U-2' aircraft can receive relatively accurate information on atmospheric turbulence, convective clouds, wind displacement, jet streams, and widely distributed meteorological phenomena such as typhoons."

Indeed, a "typhoon" was sent from the State Department!

"The National Aeronautics and Space Administration also uses this aircraft to collect information on cosmic rays and the concentration of certain molecules in the atmosphere, including ozone and water vapor." (General activity in the hall.)

This is the official statement issued by U.S. officials to mislead the public at home and around the world.

Comrade Deputies! It must be said that these statements are pure fabrications aimed at deceiving credulous people. The creators of these statements believed that since the plane was shot down, the pilot was probably dead. In that case, there would be no place to ask about the actual situation, and there would be no way to check what kind of plane it was and what instruments it was equipped with.

First, I want to announce that the pilot of the downed U.S. plane is alive and well. He is now in Moscow. The wreckage of the plane and the instruments found during the investigation have also been transported here.

The pilot's name is Francis Gary Powers. He is thirty years old this year. He confessed that he is a U.S. Air Force captain and that he served in the Air Force until 1956, when he transferred to work for the Central Intelligence Agency.

By the way, Powers confessed that when he served in the U.S. Air Force, his monthly salary was seven hundred dollars, but when he transferred to the intelligence agency and began performing espionage missions to collect secret intelligence, he received two thousand five hundred dollars per month. You see, this is how capital buys life, buys people. (Commotion in the hall.) The pilot confessed that he was not dizzy at all and that there was no oxygen cylinder failure. He flew according to the route he was instructed beforehand, accurately executed the instructions of his superiors, and operated the switches of the instruments over the predetermined targets in order to collect intelligence on Soviet military and industrial targets, until the moment when his gangster behavior in our territory was punished.

I want to talk to you about the materials obtained from the study of the downed aircraft and the instruments on the plane, and from the interrogation of the pilot. The investigation is still ongoing, but the situation is now quite clear.

First, regarding the aircraft. It is indeed a low-speed "Lockheed U-2" high-altitude aircraft. They relied on this aircraft flying high, so they estimated that no fighter could approach it, and no anti-aircraft gun could hit it. Thus, it could fly in Soviet airspace with impunity. Indeed, the aircraft flew very high, but a rocket hit it at an altitude of 20,000 meters. (Stormy applause.) Even if it flew higher, we would definitely be able to hit it! (Sustained applause.) The aircraft's equipment was not at all for "examining the climate in the upper atmosphere," and not at all for obtaining "air samples," as U.S. officials said. No, it was a thoroughbred military reconnaissance aircraft, equipped with various instruments for collecting intelligence, including photographing terrain.

After studying the downed aircraft, the authoritative expert committee determined, based on the conclusive materials studied, that the U.S. aircraft was specifically designed for aerial reconnaissance. The task of this aircraft was to traverse the entire Soviet territory from the Pamirs to the Kola Peninsula in order to use aerial photography to reconnoiter our military and industrial targets. At the same time, in addition to aerial photography equipment, the cabin was also equipped with reconnaissance instruments to discover radar networks and determine the location and frequency of operating radio stations and other special radio equipment.

We not only seized instruments from the aircraft, but also developed film and photographs of many regions of our territory. Here are some of these photographs. (Khrushchev shows the photographs to the deputies.)

Please look at these photos of airfields. These are two white lines. This is our fighter fleet. Again, airfields, again planes on the airfield. All these films were developed by ourselves. (Activity)

I will hand the photos over to Comrade Nobanov so he can study them. (Activity in the hall.)

Gasoline depots can be seen in these photos. It should be said that the photographic equipment is not bad, the photos are very clear. (Activity in the hall.)

But it should be said that our cameras take better photos, even clearer, so we didn't get anything in this regard. (Laughter in the hall.)

Industrial enterprises can be seen in these photos.

Comrade Chairman, please accept these photos as well.

There are also audio tapes recording the signals of many of our ground radar stations. All of this is the irrefutable material evidence of the espionage activities of the U.S. aircraft shot down in the Sverdlovsk region. (Commotion in the hall.)

These are the "air samples" that the U.S. reconnaissance aircraft obtained, not over Lake Van, not in Turkey, but completely in other places.

The U.S. State Department and Pentagon's claim that the pilot was dizzy due to the failure of the oxygen equipment was obviously caused by a sudden shock. The reason why this shock occurred there was because the unsuccessful attack on Soviet territory became known to the world. (Stormy applause.) Those who participated in this attack could not think of any other excuse than this clumsy statement, saying that it was a weather plane, and when the oxygen equipment failed, the pilot lost consciousness, and his plane, like a runaway horse, dragged him to Soviet territory regardless of the pilot's will. You see, how innocent! (Activity in the hall.)

The fact that the aircraft took off from the U.S.-Turkish Incirlik Air Base east of Adana is consistent with the truth. According to pilot Powers, he served in Unit 10-10, which is under the National Interstellar and Space Navigation Bureau, which is just a cover, but is actually engaged in high-altitude military reconnaissance.

In his confession, Powers named some officers who served with him at the U.S. military base in Turkey. According to Powers' confession, the commander of the U.S. 10-10 unit was Colonel William Shelton, and his assistant was Lieutenant Colonel Carroll Funk.

According to pilot Powers himself, he did not fly immediately, but prepared for a long time before flying to the Soviet interior. He had flown across the Soviet border many times in order to study the Soviet radar system.

On April 27, on the orders of his superiors, the spy Powers flew from Adana, Turkey, to the Peshawar Airport in Pakistan. On May 1, pilot Powers took off from the Peshawar Airport in Pakistan, not from the Turkish airport near Adana, as the U.S. State Department said. His mission was to fly along the route marked on his map, over the Aral Sea, Sverdlovsk, and other places, to Arkhangelsk and Murmansk, and then land at the Bodø Airport in Norway.

Now we announce where he flew. It should be said that when I last reported this matter to you, we knew this correctly, but we did not publish it in order to hear what the Americans would come up with. Now they have come up with something, so we are reporting to everyone what the actual situation is.

The following is Powers' confession during the interrogation regarding the purpose of his flight in Soviet airspace:

"I was scheduled to take off from Peshawar Airport in Pakistan, enter the Soviet border, fly through Soviet airspace, and then go to Norway (Bodø Airport). I was scheduled to fly over certain locations in the Soviet Union, including Murmansk and Arkhangelsk, as I remember. When flying over Soviet airspace, I was supposed to turn on and off the instruments over certain locations marked on the map. I believe that my flight in Soviet airspace was to collect information about Soviet missiles and radar stations."

I would like to ask the gentlemen of the U.S. State Department, what kind of "air samples" was the spy pilot Powers going to "take over Lake Van"?

I won't mention that the U.S. reconnaissance aircraft grossly violated the national sovereignty of Afghanistan during this flight, flying over its airspace without its permission. However, this may not be unusual for the morality of U.S. militarists. Their actions of this kind have long been well known. Just recall the situation when U.S. military aircraft flew over Austria in preparation for an invasion of revolutionary Iraq. At that time, the Austrian government protested against the treacherous actions of U.S. military aircraft in violating Austrian sovereignty and the rude behavior of disrespecting Austrian neutrality, which the United States had signed and agreed to.

If you believe the claim that the oxygen equipment failed, the pilot lost consciousness, and then the aircraft was piloted by the autopilot, then you must also believe that the aircraft piloted by the autopilot flew from Turkey to Pakistan, landed at the Peshawar Airport, stayed there for three days, and then took off from there again on the morning of May 1, flew over Afghan airspace, invaded the Soviet border, flew over two thousand kilometers in our territory, and flew in the air for a total of about four hours. The aircraft was monitored while flying over our country, and when the order was issued, it was shot down. (Applause.)

When our anti-aircraft rockets intercepted and shot down the plane, it must be assumed that the pilot quickly "regained consciousness," because he jumped down with a parachute, and everyone should pay attention to this: he jumped down not with the help of an ejection seat that automatically throws the pilot out, but from the upper hatch used to enter the aircraft. I ask, why did he do this when there was a device that could quickly throw people out? (Noise in the hall.)

He may have done this because there were explosives on the plane that were supposed to destroy the plane after the pilot was ejected. The pilot knew this, and he may have been afraid of being killed by the explosion. He considered it! (Active hall!)

But it was not enough to install a time bomb under the plane. In order to eliminate traces, the pilot was ordered not to be captured alive by the Soviet authorities. For this reason, the pilot carried a special pin. He was ordered to stab himself with this pin containing poison when necessary, so that he could die immediately. How barbaric! (Commotion in the hall. Some people shouted: "Shameful!" "Shameful!") Look at what that tool is – the latest achievement of American technology used to kill their own people (Khrushchev shows everyone a photo of the poison pin).

However, all living beings want to live, so when the plane was destroyed, the pilot parachuted down. After landing, he did not listen to those who assigned him to do gangster deeds against the Soviet Union, and he survived.

Someone insists that this flight was for scientific purposes to study the upper atmosphere. I ask, then why did the pilot need to be equipped with a silent pistol? They gave him a pistol just in case, but not to collect air, but to kill people. We will make all of this public as material evidence. Look at what kind of Christians these are! (Activity in the hall.) After kneeling and praying in church, they handed this pistol to the pilot, while calling us godless atheists. But we have never committed and will never commit such a crime against humanity. (Stormy applause.) If the pilot brought a pistol to defend himself against wild beasts in case he was forced to land, then why exactly did he need to bring a silent pistol? This also shows what kind of so-called scientific purposes this flight held.

This pilot, who was supposedly going to study the atmosphere, received seven thousand five hundred rubles of Soviet currency. I ask, when and where would he spend this money, and what purpose would he use the money for? Because he didn't fly here to exchange old rubles for new ones. (Roaring laughter. Stormy applause.)

This pilot also received French gold francs. I saw the physical objects of these gold francs. Please look, here are their photos. The francs are wrapped in cellophane, and cellophane is affixed to both sides of the money. It's made very nicely in the American style. Why give these francs to the pilot? He also had currencies from West Germany and Italy. In addition to his own watch, he also received two gold watches and seven women's gold rings for this flight. What did he need these things for in the upper atmosphere? (Laughter in the hall. Applause.) Could it be that this pilot was preparing to fly even higher – to fly to Mars, intending to seduce Martian girls there? (Laughter in the hall. Applause.)

Look how well-equipped the American pilot who "collects air" in the upper atmosphere is.

In this way, no fabrication can save the reputation of those who are responsible for this treacherous act. They were caught on the spot, these people who organized the invasion of Soviet airspace shortly before the Paris summit meeting of heads of government was to be held and the U.S. president was to visit the Soviet Union. I think this is a bad preparation for important talks on easing international tensions.

I will now read the reaction of the Western newspapers to this incident, because some people are still blaming us! They said that Khrushchev wanted to disrupt the summit meeting, otherwise he would not have raised this matter at the Supreme Soviet session, but would have raised the issue through some other channel.

Gentlemen, what are you expecting!? You are used to harming people, and some people seem to acquiesce to it as if it's nothing! No, we are not like this: since you have harmed people – then you must be publicly responsible. (Sustained applause.) Some people live according to this principle: if you are rich – you will not go to jail. This is true for capitalists, because capitalists can often pay to atone for their sins. However, there are such countries, there are socialist countries, where the law protects the country, protects the society, and protects every resident of these countries. (Sustained applause.)

What prompted them to take such arrogant steps? It can be seen that the reason they did this is because some people in the United States are addicted to reconnaissance activities. The "open skies" proposal put forward by the United States is well known. This proposal was rejected by us. So the U.S. military decided to "open" the Soviet sky themselves. However, there is international law, there are national borders, and no one can disrespect these laws, and no one can violate the borders of other countries.

We will reward the officers and soldiers who directly destroyed this aircraft. (Sustained applause.) We are proud that they fulfilled their military duties. I think any country that respects itself and has the means to eliminate air bandits would do this. (Applause.)

From the lofty platform of the Supreme Soviet, we once again warn those countries that provide territory for our enemy aircraft to take off to our country: gentlemen, do not play with fire! (Stormy applause.)

The governments of Turkey, Pakistan, and Norway should clearly realize that they are accomplices in this invasion, because they allowed others to use their airports against the Soviet Union. This is by no means a friendly gesture. This is a hostile action against the Soviet Union. If the governments of these three countries do not know about this – I assume they did not know about it this time – then they should also know what the U.S. military authorities are doing in their country's territory against the Soviet Union. They should draw conclusions about what the consequences will be if they provide their territory to third countries for aggressive purposes. However, it is difficult to agree with the view that the governments of these countries do not know why they provide their territory to the United States to establish air bases.

According to the American pilot, he had also been to Norway before. It seems that he had decided to study the landing conditions in advance. He flew this plane through Greece, Italy, West Germany to Norway, where he stayed for two or three weeks.

Comrade Deputies! I have spoken about the course this matter in such detail in order to refute the rather clumsy fabrications of the U.S. State Department and to inform the public in all countries, including the United States, of the conclusive materials of the U.S. aggression against our country.

The U.S. State Department's claim that the destroyed aircraft was sent out to conduct meteorological research is currently widely spread in the United States. It seems that many people there believe that this claim is true. Some social activists, politicians, and journalists quote this claim and make speeches and write articles expressing some regret, or even anger.

I once again ask these "people who express sorrow" a question: if our aircraft invaded the United States and flew over about two thousand kilometers in its territory, what attitude would the United States take?

These "people who express sorrow" might be better off asking Allen Dulles for an answer. The U.S. aircraft flew to the Soviet Union on his instructions. The whole world knows that Allen Dulles is not an expert in meteorology.

I invite those who make such accusations to come to the Soviet Union to see the wreckage of the aircraft, the equipment and instruments on it. They will see with their own eyes and be convinced of the purpose for which this aircraft was sent.

I think it might be useful to hold a special press conference where all the tools used for "taking air samples" are displayed. (General activity, applause.) In fact, these are the tools used by bandits carried and armed by American pilots who invaded Soviet airspace. We will show these equipments to everyone, to the ambassadors of various countries and foreign journalists, to all who want to see them. The shameful acts of the culprits must be made known to the world. (Sustained applause.)

In addition, I think it is right to submit the pilot's case to a court trial in order to convince the public what actions the United States is taking to provoke the Soviet Union, to create tension, and to undermine the achievements we have made in easing international tensions. (Sustained applause.)

At present, we consider this aggressive act of the U.S. aircraft invading our country to be an attempt to make nerves tense, to rekindle the "Cold War", and to revive the dead mouse. This is not yet a preparation for today's war. However, this provocative aggression is a preparation for future wars. That is why we are so firmly exposing this aggression.

The gangster-like flight of the U.S. aircraft once again emphatically pointed out the necessity of vigilance, revolutionary vigilance. This vigilance is often maintained by the Soviet people. We understand very well that there are still many dark and brutal forces in the world who hate us and are prepared to engage in adventures in order to stop the process of history and hinder our inevitable victory. We should be vigilant at every moment. We do not beg for peace because we are weak. Peace – this is a necessary condition for people to live a peaceful and happy life. However, in order for peace to truly win, peace fighters and soldiers who uphold the cause of justice must be ready at any time to fight back against the aggressors, and if the enemies of peace dare to invade our country or any other country in the socialist camp, give them a counterattack. (Stormy applause.)

Therefore, this fact should make us more vigilant. In the future, we must continue to strengthen our country's defense, not be satisfied with the achievements we have already made, and always maintain the combat readiness of our troops at the required level.

I would like to emphasize that this is not to make our country nervous, but to be calm, vigilant, and clear-headed.

Now the enemies of peace, who have been exposed by irrefutable facts, are starting to get busy. The U.S. State Department claims that U.S. aircraft did not fly over Soviet airspace on April 9, that is, the U.S. State Department denies the fact that I reported to you last time. However, you should know that I emphasized in my report that the Soviet government decided not to remind the public of the U.S. aircraft's invasion on April 9 precisely because it knew that these aggressors and militarists would argue with their eyes wide open. Only when the facts made them speechless did they reveal their true colors.

In this case, militarists and aggressors are accustomed to such a morality – if you are not caught, you are not a thief. Therefore, we did not talk about the U.S. aircraft's invasion on April 9 at all. Now we have caught the thief, we have shot it down. When we have material evidence, it is impossible to shirk responsibility. (Sustained applause.)

Now, after reading many remarks made by foreign diplomats and journalists about this matter, one cannot help but think about what kind of morality these people follow. You should know that they claim to be Christians and believers. They believers accuse us of not believing in God. However, look at how good the morality of these people is. If these people really believe in God, then at least they should be afraid of hell, they must go to hell. Because according to Christian doctrine, they have done despicable things against peace and against mankind, so they are destined to go to hell and be fried in oil. (General activity, applause.) No, these people do not believe in Christian morality, they believe in the morality of the bourgeois world, which has no Holy Spirit.

Comrade Deputies! The U.S. aircraft incident will not help peacefully resolve international disputes. However, this incident should not make us revise our plans to increase appropriations for armaments and troops, and should not make us suspend the disarmament process. In the future, we will continue to follow Lenin's peaceful policy and adhere to the proposition of peaceful coexistence. (Sustained applause.)

We should use defense funds in such a way that we are prepared with rocket weapons that we can use at any time, and are ready at any time to give a due response to the main aggressive force that incites aggression around the world and this small group of shameless aggressors. Let all aggressors know that no one can escape retribution, and both the mastermind and the servant will get what they deserve. (Applause.) And this will only be beneficial to all those who hate war.

Comrades, I report to the Supreme Soviet that, according to the government's decision, the Soviet Army and Navy are transitioning to rocket weapons, and in fact, they have already transitioned to rocket weapons. Therefore, we have established the General Command of Rocket Forces. Marshal of Artillery Nedelin, a famous artillery expert who was known during the war against Hitler's Germany, has been appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of this force. (Stormy, sustained applause.) Comrade Nedelin, I want to tell you, don't rely on God, it's best to train the troops and master the technical tools we have entrusted to you, so that when the enemy invades us, our rocket forces can give the enemy a devastating counterattack at any time! (Stormy, sustained applause.)

    在苏联最高苏维埃会议上发表结束语
    赫鲁晓夫列举大量证据谴责美国侵略行动
    指出必须更加警惕和加强国防使部队保持战斗准备
    本报讯　据塔斯社莫斯科7日电：赫鲁晓夫同志于1960年5月7日在苏联最高苏维埃会议上所作的结束语的详细摘要如下：
    代表同志们！美国飞机对苏联采取的侵略行动激起了代表们和全体苏联人民的正当的愤怒。会议和苏联政府收到了许多询问和信件。因此请允许我再一次谈谈这个问题，并且引用一些新资料。
    在我向最高苏维埃报告、宣布这一事实以后，美国国务院向报界发表的官方声明中硬说，侵犯苏联国境的美国“洛克希德U—2”型飞机似乎是在土耳其苏联边境地区进行大气层的气候研究。硬说这架飞机是由于飞行员氧气供应发生故障而失迷方向。国务院硬说，飞行员失去知觉，用自动驾驶仪操纵的飞机飞入苏联领土。据国务院说，飞行员只来得及把他的氧气设备发生故障的事情通知他起飞的土耳其亚达那机场，而这个机场据说不是军用机场，而是属于国家航空和宇宙航行局的。
    国家航空和宇宙航行局立即发表了一项声明，想证实国务院的说法。这项声明中说：
    “国家航空和宇宙航行局的一架供进行科学研究用的、从1956年起用来研究高空大气条件和阵风的“U—2型”飞机在它的飞行员通知说他在土耳其地区凡湖上空氧气发生困难以后，从当地时间5月1日早上九时起下落不明。”
    同志们！我应该告诉你们一个秘密。当我作报告的时候，我故意没有说飞行员还活着和健康，而且飞机残骸在我们这里。（笑声。经久不息的掌声）我们是故意这样作的，因为如果我们一下子把什么都说出来，那么美国人就会编造另一种说法。（场内笑声。掌声）
    而现在你们看，他们说了多少蠢话啊——什么凡湖、科学研究等等。
  现在，当他们知道飞行员还活着的时候，就不得不另编造一套了。而且他们会想出……（场内笑声，掌声）。
    声明中还说：
      “飞机是从土耳其的英斯季利克空军基地起飞的。飞行计划规定第一个监察点是座标为北纬三十七度二十五分和东经四十一度二十三分的地方，然后向左转向凡湖的无线电指标，再转向特拉布松和安塔利亚的无线电指标，并回到亚达那”。这就是他们宣布的“确切”的材料。稍后我要讲到实际上是怎么回事。
      “飞行应该持续三小时四十五分钟，在这一期间，飞机应飞行一千四百海里。飞机在当地时间上午八时起飞。大约起飞后一小时，飞行员通知说氧气设备失灵。他用专用于发生事故的无线电波通知说，他把飞机驶向凡湖的无线电指标，以便获得方位，然后返回亚达那。”
    声明中接着说：“如前面所述，按照飞行计划他应该在凡湖的无线电指标向左转。根据他最后一次通知来看，他打算接受这个无线电指标的信号。据估计，他可能按照东北路线飞行，但是以后同他的联系就断绝了。
    接到他最后的通知后就立即开始寻找。凡湖地区的地形是崇山峻岭”。说凡湖地区是多山的地形，这是正确的。
      “没有发现任何飞机失事的迹象”。这也是正确的，因为这架飞机根本不会在那里失事。
    声明接着详细谈到飞机是用什么仪器装备起来的，它抱着怎样“和平”的目的。请允许我再谈其中的一段：
      “装置在‘U—2型’飞机上的仪器可以收到大气的紊流、对流云、风的位仪、射流和像台风这样的广泛分布的气象现象等的比较精确的情报”。
    的确，从国务院发出了“台风”！
    “国家航空和宇宙航行局还利用这架飞机去收集宇宙线和大气某些分子的浓度的情报，其中包括臭氧和水蒸气的情报”。（全场活跃）
    这就是美国负责人士为了迷惑本国和全世界公众而发出的官方说法。
    代表同志们！应该说，这些说法纯粹是捏造，旨在于欺骗轻信的人。这些说法的编造者认为，既然飞机被击落了，大概飞行员也就死了。这样一来，就没有地方去问实际情况如何，也无法检查出这是架什么样的飞机和它装备有什么样的仪器。
    首先我要宣布，被击落的美国飞机的飞行员还活着，而且健康。他现在在莫斯科。这架飞机的残骸和在调查过程中发现的仪器也运到了这里。
    这个飞行员的名字叫作弗朗西斯·加里·鲍尔士（前译弗朗西斯·哈里·鲍尔士——编注）。今年三十岁。他供认，他是美国空军上尉，他在空军任职到1956年，即到他转到中央情报局供职时为止。
    顺便提一提，鲍尔士供认，在美国空军任职时，他的月薪七百美元，而当他转到情报机关，并开始执行搜集秘密情报的间谍任务时，每月拿到二千五百美元。请看，资本就是这样买到生命、买到人的。（场内轰动）这个飞行员供认，他丝毫也未曾头晕，而且也没有什么氧气筒损坏的事情。他按照事先指示他的路线飞行，准确地执行他的上级的指示，在预定目标上空操纵仪器的开关，以便收集苏联的军事和工业目标的情报，一直飞行到他在我国境内的强盗行为受到惩罚的那一刻为止。
    我想向你们谈谈对那架被击落的飞机和飞机上的仪器进行研究和对飞行员进行审讯所获得的材料。侦查还在继续进行，但是现在情况已经相当清楚了。
    第一，关于飞机。这的确是一架低速度的“洛克希德U—2型”高空飞行飞机。他们指靠这架飞机飞得高，因此估计，任何歼击机都接近不了这架飞机，而高射炮也打不到它。这样，它便可以不受惩罚地在苏联领空飞行。的确，飞机飞得很高，但是，火箭在两万米的高空打中了它。（暴风雨般的掌声）即使它飞得再高，我们也一定能打中它！（经久不息的掌声）飞机的装置完全不是为了“考察大气高层中的气候”，完全不是为了获取“空气样品”，像美国官方人士所说的那样。不，这是一架道道地地的军事侦察机，它装有收集情报，其中包括拍摄地势的各种仪器。
    权威的专家委员会研究了被击落的飞机后，根据所研究的确凿材料断定，这架美国飞机是专供进行空中侦察用的。这架飞机的任务是穿越从帕米尔到科拉半岛的苏联全部领土，以便用空中摄影的方法侦察我国的军事和工业目标。同时，在机舱里，除了空中摄影仪器外，还装有用以发现雷达网、确定正在工作的电台和其他特别无线电设备的位置和频率的侦察仪器。
    我们不仅从这架飞机上查获了仪器，而且还查获了已经洗好了的胶片和我国领土上许多地区的照片。这就是这些照片的一部分。（赫鲁晓夫把照片给代表们看）
    请看看这些飞机场的照片。这是两条白线。这是我们的歼击机队。又是机场，又是机场上的飞机。所有这些胶片都是我们自己洗出来的。
  （活跃）
    我把照片转交给诺巴诺夫同志，让他研究一下。（场内活跃）
    在这些照片上可以看到汽油库。应该说，摄影仪器不坏，照片非常清楚。（场内活跃）
    但是应当说，我们的照像机拍的照片更好，更加清楚，因此，在这方面我们没有得到什么东西。（场内笑声）
    在这些照片上可以看见工业企业。
    主席同志，这些照片也请收下。
    还有记录了我们许多地面雷达站信号的录音带。所有这一切都是在斯维德洛夫斯克地区被击落的美国飞机进行间谍活动的无可争辩的物证。（场内轰动）
    这就是美国侦察机不在凡湖上空、不在土耳其，而完全是在另外的地方所获取的“空气样品”。
    美国国务院和五角大楼关于飞行员因氧气设备损坏而头昏的说法，显然是由于突然的震荡而产生的。这种震荡所以会在那里发生，是由于对苏联领土的不成功的偷袭被全世界所知道了。（暴风雨般的掌声）参予这种偷袭的人除了这种笨拙的说法之外想不出别的名堂来，他们说，这是气象飞机，当氧气设备损坏时飞行员失去了知觉，他的飞机就像一只脱缰的马一样，不顾飞行员的意志，把他拉到苏联领土。你们看，这是多么无辜啊！（场内活跃）
    这架飞机是从亚达那城以东的美国—土耳其英季利克空军基地起飞的，这才符合真实情况。据飞行员鲍尔士供认，他在10—10部队服务，这个部队属全国星际和空间航行局管，只是个掩护，但实际上是从事着高空军事侦察。
    鲍尔士在他的供词中供出了同他一起在土耳其美国军事基地服务过的一些军官的名字。根据鲍尔士的供词，美国10—10部队的指挥官是威廉·谢尔顿上校，他的助手是卡罗尔·丰克中校。
    据飞行员鲍尔士本人说，他不是立即就飞行的，而是经过很长时间准备才飞向苏联腹地，他曾多次飞越苏联国境，目的是为了研究苏联的雷达系统。
    间谍鲍尔士于4月27日奉上级命令从土耳其亚达那城飞到巴基斯坦的白沙瓦机场。5月1日飞行员鲍尔士就从巴基斯坦的白沙瓦机场起飞，而并不是像美国国务院所说那样从亚达那市附近的土耳其机场起飞，他的任务是沿着在他的地图标出的航线飞过咸海、斯维德洛夫斯克和其他地点上空，到阿尔汗格尔斯克和摩尔曼斯克，然后在挪威的布德机场着陆。
    现在我们宣布他飞到什么地方去。应该说，当我上次向你们报告这件事的时候，我们就正确地知道了这一点，但是我们没有发表，目的是想听一听美国人会想出什么东西来。现在他们果然想出来了，于是我们向大家报告实际情况是怎么一回事。
    下面就是鲍尔士在审讯时关于他在苏联领空飞行的目的的供词：
    “我原定从巴基斯坦的白沙瓦机场起飞，进入苏联国境，飞过苏联领空，然后到挪威（布德机场）。我原定飞过苏联的一定的地点，我记得其中包括摩尔曼斯克和阿尔汗格尔斯克。在飞越苏联领空时，我应在地图上标明的一定的地点上空打开和关闭仪器。我认为，我在苏联领空的飞行是为了搜集有关苏联导弹和雷达站的情报。”
    我想问一问美国国务院的先生们，间谍飞行员鲍尔士要在“凡湖上空取”什么样的“空气样品”？
    我这里尚且不谈，美国侦察飞机在进行这次飞行时，粗暴地破坏了阿富汗国家的主权，未经它的允许就飞越了这个国家的领空。不过这一点对美国军国主义者的道德来说，也许是没有什么不寻常的。他们的这类行动早已是人所共知的了。只要回忆一下美国在准备对发生革命的伊拉克进行侵略时，它的军用飞机飞越奥地利上空的情况就够了。当时奥地利政府曾对美国军用飞机背信弃义地侵犯奥地利主权的行动提出了抗议，抗议不尊重由美国签字同意的奥地利中立的这种粗暴行为。
    如果相信所谓氧气设备发生故障，飞行员失去了知觉，然后，飞机是由自动驾驶仪驾驶的这种说法的话，那么，也就必须相信这样一点：由自动驾驶仪驾驶的飞机从土耳其飞到巴基斯坦，在白沙瓦机场着陆，在那里停留了三天，5月1日早晨又从那里起飞，飞过阿富汗的领空，侵入苏联国境，在我国领土上空飞过了两千多公里，在空中飞行了共计约四小时。飞机在我国上空飞行时一直受到监视，一当命令发出，它就被击落了。（掌声）
    当我们的高射火箭炮迎击并击落飞机的时候，必须设想，飞行员很快就“恢复了知觉”，因为他带着降落伞跳下来了，并且大家要注意这一点：他跳下来时，不是借助于自动把飞行员投下的弹射座，而是从供进入飞机用的上部舱盖出来的。试问，为什么在设有把人迅速抛下的装置的情况下，他这样做呢？（场内喧哗）
    他这样做可能是因为在飞机上有爆炸物，这种爆炸物要在飞行员被弹射出来之后，把飞机炸毁。飞行员知道这一点，他可能害怕在爆炸时炸死他。他考虑了！（大厅活跃）
    但是，在这架飞机下面装有定时炸弹还不够。为了消灭罪迹，飞行员奉命不得为苏联当局活擒。为此，这个飞行员身上带了一枚特制的别针。他奉命在必要时就用这枚带毒药的别针往自己身上扎，这样可以立即死去。这是多么野蛮！（场内喧哗。有人喊：“可耻！”“可耻！”）请看这就是那个工具——美国技术用来杀害他们自己人的最新成就（赫鲁晓夫把带毒药的别针照片拿给大家看）。
    但是，一切生灵都希望活着，所以当飞机被击毁的时候，飞行员便跳伞下来了。他着陆以后并没有听从那些指派他来对苏联干强盗勾当的人的意见，他活下来了。
    有人硬说，这次飞行是为了科学目的而来研究大气高层的。试问，那为什么需要给飞行员装备无声手枪呢？他们给他手枪以防万一，但是，不是为了收集空气，而是为了要人的命。我们将把所有这些公诸于世，作为物证。请看，这是些什么样的基督教徒！（场内活跃）他们在教堂里跪拜祷告之后把这种手枪交给了飞行员，而称我们是天杀的无神论者。但是，我们从来也没有而且永远不会对人类犯这样的罪行。（暴风雨般的掌声）如果飞行员带上手枪是为了在一旦被迫着陆时防御野兽，那么，试问，为什么恰恰需要带无声手枪呢？这一点也说明，这次飞行所抱的是一些什么样的所谓科学目的。
    这个据说是要研究大气的飞行员拿到了七千五百卢布的苏联币。试问，在什么时候和到什么地方去花这些钱，要用钱达到什么目的呢？因为他并不是飞来用旧卢布换新币的。（哄堂大笑。暴风雨般的掌声）
    这个飞行员还得到了法国的金法郎。我看到了这些金法郎的实物，请你们看，这就是它们的照片。法郎用玻璃纸包着，钱的两面都贴着玻璃纸。按照美国的式样搞得很好看。为什么要给飞行员这些法郎呢？他身上还有西德和意大利等国的货币。此外，除了他自己的手表以外，他还因这次飞行而得到了两只金表和七枚女式金戒指。他在大气高层要这些东西干什么用？（场内笑声。掌声）莫非是这位飞行员本来准备飞得更高一些——飞上火星，打算到那里去勾引火星姑娘？（场内笑声。掌声）
    请看，给在大气高层飞行“收集空气”的美国飞行员装备得多么周到。
    这样一来，任何捏造的说法都不能挽救那些要对这次背信弃义的行为负责的人的声誉。他们被当场抓住了，这些人是在不久就要开巴黎政府首脑会议、美国总统不久就要访问苏联的时候侵犯苏联领空事件的组织者。我想，这是对缓和国际紧张局势的重要会谈进行不良的准备。
    我现在读一读西方报纸对这一事件的反应，因为有人还在责备我们！他们说，赫鲁晓夫想破坏政府首脑会议，否则他不会把这件事在最高苏维埃会议上提出，而会通过什么别的途径把这个问题提出来的。
    先生们，你们是在指望什么！？你们害人害惯了，某些人好像认为这不算什么而予以默许！不，我们不是这样的人：既然你们害了人——那你们自己要公开负责。（经久不息的掌声）有人是按照这样的准则生活：如果是富人——便不会坐牢。这对资本家来讲是正确的，因为资本家经常可以花钱赎罪。但是，有这样的国家，有社会主义国家存在，这里的法律是保护国家、保护社会、保护这些国家的每一个居民的。（经久不息的掌声）
    是什么东西推动他们采取这样狂妄的步骤呢？看出他们所以这样做，是因为美国有些人酷嗜侦察活动。美国提出的“开放天空”建议是很闻名的。这一建议遭到了我们的拒绝。于是美国军人就决定自己来“开放”苏联的天空。但是，有国际法摆着，有国界存在，任何人都不能不尊重这些法律，都不得侵犯别国的国界。
    我们将要奖励那些直接击毁这架飞机的官兵。（经久不息的掌声）我们感到骄傲的是，他们履行了自己的军人职责。我想，任何一个自我尊重的和拥有消灭空中强盗的手段的国家都会这样做。（掌声）
    我们从最高苏维埃的崇高讲台上再一次警告那些提供领土让与我们为敌的飞机向我国起飞的国家：先生们，不要玩火！（暴风雨般的掌声）
    土耳其、巴基斯坦和挪威三国政府应当清楚地意识到，它们是这次侵犯的同谋者，因为它们允许别人利用自己的机场来反对苏联。这决不是友好的表现。这是它们对苏联的敌视行动。如果这三国政府不知道这件事——我设想，它们在这次是不知道的——，那么它们也应当知道，美国军事当局在它们国家领土上搞些什么事来反对苏联。它们应当得出结论，它们把自己的领土提供给第三国用来实现侵略目的，这样会导致什么结果。但是，很难同意这样的看法：这些国家的政府不知道，它们把自己领土供给美国来建立空军基地是为了什么目的。
    据这个美国飞行员供认，他以前也曾在挪威，看来，他预先就决定研究降落的条件。他驾驶这架飞机经过希腊、意大利、西德飞抵挪威，在那里呆了二三个星期。
    代表同志们！我这样详细地说这件事的经过，是为了驳斥美国国务院相当笨拙的捏造，是为了把美国对我国进行侵略行动的确凿材料告知包括美国在内的各国的公众。
    美国国务院说，被击毁的飞机是派出进行气象研究的，这种说法目前在美国广泛传开，看来，那里有许多人相信这种说法是真实的。有些社会活动家、政治家、记者引证这种说法，发表谈话和写文章表示某种遗憾，甚至是愤怒。
    我再一次向这些“表示难过的人”提个问题：如果我国飞机侵入美国境内，并在它的领土上飞越约两千公里，那么美国会采取什么态度呢？
    这些“表示难过的人”向艾伦·杜勒斯去要求答复也许更好吧，美国飞机是根据他的指示飞到苏联来的。全世界都知道，艾伦·杜勒斯并不是一个气象学方面的大专家。
    我请那些提出这类控诉的人到苏联来看看飞机的残骸、上面的设备和仪器。他们就会亲眼见到而确信派这架飞机来是抱有什么目的。
    我认为，不妨举行一次专门的记者招待会，在招待会上把“取空气试样”用的全部工具都摆出来，（全场活跃、掌声）实际上，这是一些侵犯苏联领空的美国飞行员所携带和武装的盗匪用的工具。我们将把这些装备拿给大家看，拿给各国大使和外国记者，拿给所有愿意看的人看。必须把祸首的可耻行为公诸天下。（经久不息的掌声）
    此外，我想，为了使公众能相信美国正在采取怎样的行动向苏联挑衅，来制造紧张气氛，来破坏我们在缓和国际紧张局势方面所取得的成就，把这个飞行员的案件提交法庭审判是正确的。（经久不息的掌声）
    目前我们认为侵犯我国国境的美国飞机的这一侵略行动，是企图使神经紧张起来，使“冷战”复燃，使死老鼠复活。这暂且还不是今天战争的准备。但是，这一挑衅性的侵略行动是未来战争的准备。正因为如此，我们这样坚决地揭露这种侵略行动。
    美国飞机强盗式的飞行这件事再一次着重指明了警惕性、革命警惕性的必要性。这种警惕性是苏联人经常保持的。我们很明白，世界上还存在着许多黑暗的、凶暴的势力，他们仇视我们，并准备进行冒险活动，以便阻止历史的进程和阻碍我们必然取得的胜利。我们应该每时每刻地保持警惕。我们不是因为软弱而乞求和平。和平——这是人们过平静的、幸福的生活的必要条件。但是，为了使和平真正获得胜利，必须使和平战士和维护正义事业的军人随时准备回击侵略者，如果和平的敌人胆敢侵略我国或社会主义阵营其他任何国家的话，就给他们以回击。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    因此，这个事实应该使我们更加警惕。今后仍必须加强我国的国防，不要满足已经取得的成就，把我们的部队的战斗准备一直保持在应有的水平上。
    我想着重指出，这不是要把我国弄得神经紧张，而是要沉着、警惕和头脑清醒。
    现在被无可辩驳的事实揭穿了的和平的敌人开始忙碌起来了。美国国务院声称，美国的飞机没有在4月9日飞越苏联的领空，就是说，美国国务院否认我上次向你们报告的事实。然而要知道，我在报告中已经强调指出，苏联政府正是因为这样，才决定不提醒公众注意美国飞机4月9日入侵的事实，因为知道这些侵略者和黩武主义者一定会瞪着眼睛进行狡辩。只是当事实使他们无以对答的时候，他们才暴露出真面目。
    在这种情况下黩武主义者和侵略者们已习惯于这样一种道德——不被捉住，就不是贼。因此我们才丝毫没有谈美国飞机4月9日入侵的事。现在我们把贼捉住了，我们把它击落了。当我们有了物证的时候，想推掉责任已经不可能了。（经久不息的掌声）
    现在读了外国外交家和记者关于这件事所发表的许多言论后，不由得使人考虑到，这些人遵循着什么样的道德。要知道，他们自命为基督教徒、信教人。他们信教人责难我们不信神。可是，瞧这些人的道德有多好啊。如果，这种人真的信上帝，那么，他们至少也该害怕地狱，他们一定要下地狱。因为按照基督教义说来，他们干了反对和平、反对人类的下贱勾当，所以他们注定要入地狱下油锅。（全场活跃，掌声）不，这些人并不信仰基督教的道德，他们信仰的是没有什么圣灵可言的资产阶级世界的道德。
    代表同志们！美国飞机事件不会有助于和平解决国际争端。但是，这一事件不应该使我们修改计划去增加用于军备和军队的拨款，不应该使我们中止裁军过程。我们今后仍将遵循列宁的和平政策，坚持和平共处的主张。（经久不息的掌声）
    我们应该这样使用国防资金，即准备好我们随时可以使用的火箭武器，随时随刻准备给予鼓动全世界侵略者的主要侵略力量和这一小撮无耻的侵略者以应有的回答。让所有的侵略者都知道，一个也逃避不了报应，主谋也好，仆从也好，都将各得其所。（掌声）而这对一切仇恨战争的人都只会有好处。
    同志们，我向最高苏维埃报告，根据政府的决定，苏联陆军和海军正向火箭武器过渡，其实，已经过渡到火箭武器了。因此，我们成立了火箭部队的总司令部。同希特勒德国作战时期闻名的炮兵家、炮兵主帅涅杰林被任命为这种部队的总司令。（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声）涅杰林同志，我想告诉您，不要指望上帝，最好是训练军队和去掌握我们委托给你们的技术工具，以便在有敌人侵犯我们的时候，使我们的火箭部队能够随时随刻给敌人以毁灭性的回击！（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声）
