Xinhua News Agency, May 28th: Cuban Army Inspector General Major William Gálvez Rodríguez, who is currently visiting China, solemnly stated in an interview with this agency today that the Cuban people will not hesitate to sacrifice everything, if necessary, to counter the military and economic threats posed by U.S. imperialism against Cuba, and must end the exploitation of U.S. capital. Gálvez pointed out, "Our struggle against imperialism is a just cause. We do not ask for anything that does not belong to us, but we must obtain what originally belonged to the Cuban people."

He strongly condemned the increasingly malicious economic policies and measures adopted by U.S. monopoly groups against Cuba.

Gálvez deeply thanked the Chinese people for their sympathy and support for the Cuban revolution.

He condemned U.S. imperialism for sabotaging the Four-Power Summit. He pointed out that U.S. monopoly capital, especially arms dealers, do not want any easing of international tensions. He also pointed out that the U.S. war policy is developing day by day.

Gálvez said that from the large-scale mass rallies against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs that he personally attended in Beijing and Shanghai, "I saw how much support and concern the Chinese people give to the struggles of all countries against colonialism, against puppet regimes, against oppression, against foreign monopoly capital, and against discrimination."

Gálvez used the reality of China, which he saw with his own eyes, to refute the various slanders and deceptive propaganda about China spread by imperialist elements. He said, "I saw how the Chinese people are building their motherland with their own hands, I saw how people who were like slaves before liberation have become true human beings, I saw the happy lives of the Chinese people living in the new era, children hoping to grow up faster so they can work for the people, and old people unwilling to die, wanting to continue to be contributors to the motherland. I saw how the Chinese People's Army is helping the people in production, and how it is as inseparable from the people as fish and water. I saw how the Chinese people love Chairman Mao and other leaders. These things deeply moved all visitors. Every truly honest person who has visited China cannot but shout: What a great and beautiful cause the Chinese people are undertaking!"

    古巴军队总督察斥美国的经济威胁
    古巴一定要结束美国资本剥削
    感谢我国对古巴的支持　赞扬我国人民的建设热情
    据新华社28日讯　正在我国进行访问的古巴军队总督察威廉·加尔维斯·罗德里格斯少校今天接见本社记者时郑重申明，古巴人民在必要时将不惜牺牲一切来对付美帝国主义对古巴的军事侵略威胁和经济威胁，一定要结束美国资本的剥削。加尔维斯指出：“我们古巴人民反对帝国主义的斗争，是正义的事业。我们不要求不属于我们的任何东西，但我们必须获得原来就属于古巴人民的东西。”
    他强烈指责美国垄断集团对古巴所采取的越来越恶毒的经济政策和措施。
    加尔维斯深深感谢中国人民对古巴革命的同情和支持。
    他谴责美帝国主义破坏了四国首脑会议。他指出，美国垄断资本、特别是军火巨商根本就不要缓和国际紧张局势。他还指出，美国的战争政策正在日益发展。
    加尔维斯说，从他在北京和上海亲身参加的反对美帝国主义及其走狗们的大规模群众集会上，“我看到了中国人民对各国人民反对殖民主义、反对傀儡政权、反对压迫、反对外国垄断资本、反对歧视的斗争给予了多么大的支持和关怀。”
    加尔维斯以他亲身看到的中国的现实，驳斥了帝国主义分子关于中国的各种诬蔑和欺骗宣传。他说：“我看到了中国人民如何用自己的双手在建设祖国，我看到了解放以前像奴隶一样的人民如何变成了真正的人，我看到了生活在新时代中的中国人民的幸福生活，孩子们希望自己更快成长，可为人民工作，老年人不愿死亡，要使自己继续成为对祖国有贡献的人。我看到了中国人民军队如何在帮助人民生产，如何与人民水乳交融。我看到了中国人民如何热爱毛主席和其他领导人。这些，使所有访问者深为感动。每一个到中国访问过的真正诚实的人都不能不高呼：中国人民正在进行多么伟大多么美丽的事业！”
