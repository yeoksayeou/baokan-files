Think of the Past in the Name of Revolution
	Du Ruoxiang

	Not long ago, the China Children's Theater performed "Heroic Youngster Liu Wenxue," causing a sensation among the Young Pioneers in Beijing. Schools almost took turns booking the theater. It is said that many schools from other places also wrote letters and sent telegrams to request the script, wanting to see the play and requesting it to be performed there.

	From late April, in commemoration of the great proletarian revolutionary teacher Lenin's birthday, the China Children's Theater, in collaboration with the Beijing People's Art Theater, performed "Lenin and the Second Generation." For more than ten days, it has been packed, and the young audience has repeatedly requested to see the play. Thus, the theater had to change its plan and perform for another ten days.

	What do these situations illustrate? The issue is very clear: our current drama (as well as other art forms) is not just a cultural entertainment activity, but more importantly, a powerful tool for conducting communist propaganda and education among the new generation and the broad masses of people. This point is becoming increasingly clear. The China Children's Theater uses the tool of spoken drama to conduct revolutionary education for children through artistic images on the stage, inspiring children to love the motherland, love socialism, love the Party, and love the people, excellently playing the role of "engineers of the soul." As audience members, we should deeply salute them.

	"Lenin and the Second Generation" is not only of educational significance to children but also to adults. The play repeatedly elucidates the idea that even in the most arduous years of the revolution, Lenin and the Bolshevik Party were always concerned about the second generation growing up in the revolutionary storm, regarding the work of saving children as a serious and sacred struggle, and expressing lofty revolutionary feelings towards the future builders of communism. Revolution was won through arduous struggles. In the name of revolution, think of the past, think of those comrades who bravely sacrificed their lives to defend the revolution, to defend the proletarian regime, and for the happiness of future generations. Thinking of them, we will understand how to live and fight, and how to treat the class enemies who are constantly trying to sabotage. Children should remember this profound theme, and adults should remember it firmly. "Because forgetting means betrayal!" This is what Lenin said at the end of the play. This sentence resonated in the audience's hearts for a long time, making people think long after leaving the theater, from the 1920s to the 1960s. Through the storms of time, this sentence always shines with light and always becomes the motto of all true Marxists.

	There are not many Lenin images塑造(shaping, molding) on the Chinese stage. In this play, Comrade Zhou Zheng successfully expressed the profound, peaceful, humble, and enthusiastic qualities of the great proletarian teacher. In front of him, not only children would not feel strange, but even adults would feel unusually亲切(warm and close), willing to confide all their innermost thoughts to him. He treated the children with such enthusiasm, calling them "comrades." In order to let the children sleep peacefully in his office, he moved the meetings of the Revolutionary Military Committee to other rooms. Yu Shizhi, who played Dzerzhinsky, also did not follow the old path of portraying this extraordinary figure in other dramas and films, but strived to show his greatness from the ordinary. From the excellent performances of the actors, we can appreciate Lenin's and the Bolshevik Party's meticulous care and亲切(warm) expectations for the younger generation.覃琨(Qin Kun), who played Vasya, and 方掬芬(Fang Jufen), who played Petya, are two talented young actors. They vividly expressed the different personalities of the two children and how they grew from ignorant wandering children to become Party's幼儿(young members). The other actors of the Children's Theater, who were once familiar to the young audience in different roles, showed the audience their all-around maturity in their new positions. This is something to celebrate.

    以革命的名义想想过去
    杜若湘
    不久以前，中国儿童剧院演出了“英雄少年刘文学”，轰动了全北京市的少先队员们，剧场几乎轮流地被学校包了场。听说还有许多外地的学校写信、打电报来要剧本，想看戏，要求到那里去演出。
    4月下旬起，为了纪念伟大的无产阶级革命导师列宁诞辰，中国儿童剧院又同北京人民艺术剧院合作演出了“列宁与第二代”，十多天以来，也是座无虚席，小观众们一再要求能看到戏，这样，剧院只好改变了计划，再演十天。
    这些情况说明了什么呢？问题很明白：我们今天的戏剧（以及其他的艺术形式），已经不只是一种文化娱乐活动，而且更重要的是向新的一代、向广大人民群众进行共产主义的宣传教育的有力工具。这一点，越来越明显。中国儿童剧院运用话剧的工具，通过舞台上的艺术形象，向孩子们进行革命教育，激发孩子们热爱祖国，热爱社会主义，热爱党，热爱人民，出色地起着“灵魂工程师”的作用。作为观众，是应该深深致意的。
    “列宁与第二代”不仅对孩子们有教育意义，对成年人同样也有教育意义。戏里反复阐明着这样的思想：即使在革命的最艰苦的年代，列宁和布尔什维克党无时无刻不在关心着在革命风暴中成长着的第二代，把拯救孩子的工作，看作是一场严肃而神圣的斗争，对未来的共产主义建设者们，表现崇高的革命感情。革命是经历了艰苦的斗争才取得胜利的。以革命的名义想想过去，想想那些为了保卫革命、为了保卫无产阶级政权、为了后代幸福而勇敢牺牲了生命的同志们吧，想想他们，我们就会懂得怎样去生活和战斗，怎样去对待时刻在伺机破坏的阶级敌人。这样深刻的主题思想，孩子们应该记住，成年人更应该牢牢地记住。“因为忘记，那就是意味着背叛！”这是戏结束时列宁所说的。这句话久久地在观众心头激荡，使人们离开剧场之后很久很久，还在思索着，从二十年代想到六十年代。穿过时间的暴风雨，这句话始终闪烁着光芒，始终成为一切真正的马克思主义者的座右铭。
    在中国舞台上塑造的列宁形象还不多。在这个戏里，周正同志成功地表现了无产阶级伟大导师的深沉、平和、谦虚而热情的品质。在他面前，不仅孩子不会感到陌生，就连成年人也会感到异常亲切，愿意把一切心里话都对他倾诉。他对待孩子是那么热情，称他们为“同志”。为了让孩子们在他办公室安静地睡觉，他把革命军事委员会的会议都挪到别的房间里去开。扮演捷尔任斯基的于是之也没有沿着其他话剧和影片里表现这个非凡人物的旧路走，而是力求从平凡中表现他的伟大。从演员们的出色的表演里，我们能够体会到列宁和布尔什维克党对青少年一代的无微不至的关怀和亲切的期望。扮演瓦夏的覃琨和扮演彼嘉的方掬芬，是两位有才能的青年演员，她们鲜明地表现了两个孩子不同的性格，并且怎样从茫然无知的流浪儿成长为党的幼儿。哥哥提出要入党，弟弟在“研究马克思”。儿童剧院的其他演员们，曾经以不同的角色被小观众们熟悉，他们在新的岗位上，向观众们表明自己各方面的更加成熟。这是值得庆贺的。
