Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 27th dispatch: As two hundred thousand people held an unprecedented large-scale demonstration and surrounded the National Diet yesterday, Japanese traitor Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, like a "rat crossing the street," searched everywhere for a place to hide amid the angry shouts of the demonstrators.

At 11:00 AM, this object of the demonstrators' ire—Nobusuke Kishi—managed to enter the Akasaka Prince Hotel to hold secret talks with advisors from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. However, after the meeting, Kishi furrowed his brow and pondered with his advisors: how to hide safely? How to hide?

According to Kyodo News, someone suggested at the time that the National Diet Building was the best "shelter" to escape this demonstration storm. Therefore, at 2:00 PM, escorted by five thousand police officers, Kishi sneaked into the National Diet Building through the back door. At that time, Kishi was only about twenty meters away from the vanguard of the demonstrators and was almost caught by them.

As soon as Kishi entered the National Diet Building, the doors were tightly closed. His secretary hurriedly called his master's home and said, "The Prime Minister has safely entered the building," he particularly emphasized the two words "safely."

After Kishi hid in the National Diet Building, he was still shaken. He wore a long face and remained silent. From the room where he was staying, one could hear the angry shouts of the demonstrators holding countless red flags: "Down with Kishi Nobusuke!" "Kishi Nobusuke, step down quickly!". Although the weather was very stuffy, all the windows in Kishi's room were tightly closed. Kishi's confidant, Norio Nanjo, and three or four other attendants served him. They paced anxiously, watching Kishi's expression.

At around 4:00 PM, National Public Safety Commission Chairman, Ganichiro Ishihara, went in to report to Kishi. Kishi said to him with a frustrated expression, "I don't have anything special here, so I don't need to stay here. But, I can't get out."

Kyodo News said that at the time, "There was not a single person in the corridors inside the National Diet Building, it was frighteningly silent. However, Kishi was stuck inside and couldn't get out. At that moment, the Diet turned into 'a large can for Kishi Nobusuke'".

Whenever Kishi attempted to sneak out of the National Diet Building through this door or that door, the demonstrators outside would swarm to that location, so Kishi could never get out. It wasn't until around 10:30 PM that Kishi, under heavy police escort, escaped back to his home in a car from the back door of the National Diet Building.

    卖国贼在群众示威风暴中无处容身
    岸信介像“过街老鼠”到处躲藏
    在军警护送下溜进国会大厦，被困八个多小时后从后门逃回家去
    据新华社27日讯　东京消息：当昨天二十万群众举行规模空前的大示威并包围国会的时候，日本卖国首相岸信介就像一只“过街老鼠”一样，在示威者的愤怒口号声中，到处寻找藏身的地方。
    上午十一点钟，这个示威者的对象——岸信介设法进入赤坂皇子饭店，同执政的自由民主党顾问举行密谈。可是会谈后，岸信介紧锁双眉和他的顾问们苦思：如何安全地隐藏起来？怎样隐藏？
    据共同社报道，当时有人出主意说，国会大厦是躲避这次示威风暴的最好的“避难所”。因此，下午两点钟，在五千名警察的护送下，岸信介从后门溜进国会大厦。当时，岸信介离示威者的先头部队只有二十米左右，几乎被示威者赶上。
    岸信介一进入国会大厦，大门就紧紧地关上了。他的秘书赶忙打电话给他的主子的家里说：“首相已经平安进入大厦”，他特别强调“平安”两个字。
    岸信介躲进国会大厦后，仍有余悸。他拉长着脸，默不作声。从他呆着的房间里可以听到高举着无数红旗的示威者愤怒的呼声：“打倒岸信介！”“岸信介快下台！”。虽然天气很闷热，但是岸信介的屋子里的所有的窗户还是关得紧紧的。岸信介的亲信南条德男和其他三、四个侍者侍候着他。他们焦急地转来转去看着岸信介的表情。
    下午四点钟左右，国家公安委员会委员长石原干市郎进去向岸信介报告。岸信介脸色沮丧地对他说，“我在这里没有什么特别的事情，因此我不必留在这里。但是，又出不去。”
    共同社说，当时，“国会大厦内的走廊里没有一个人影，寂静得可怕。但是，岸信介呆在里面想出也出不来，这下子，国会变成了
  ‘岸信介的一个大罐头’”。
    每当岸信介企图从这个门或那个门偷跑出国会大厦时，外边示威群众就涌到那个地点去，因此岸信介总是出不去。直到晚上十点半左右，岸信介才在警察森严的护送下，乘着小汽车从国会大厦后门逃回他的家里去。
