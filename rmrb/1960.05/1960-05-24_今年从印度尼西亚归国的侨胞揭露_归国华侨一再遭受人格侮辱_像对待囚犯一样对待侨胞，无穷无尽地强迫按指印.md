Xinhua News Agency, 23rd Dispatch: Overseas Chinese who have returned from Indonesia this year have revealed numerous facts about how powerful groups in Indonesia force overseas Chinese to give a large number of fingerprints, rudely insult their personalities, and use this as a means to obstruct their return to the motherland.

	A Family of Fifteen, Each Required to Give Seventy-Two Fingerprints
	Returned overseas Chinese Lin Shiyu and others revealed: "On April 22nd, I went to the Selat Panjang Police Station to complete the procedures for returning to China. The police station actually demanded that my entire family of fifteen people come to complete the procedures together, each person having to give seventy-two fingerprints. They immediately took out a piece of paper printed with Indonesian and asked me to put my fingerprints on it. I requested to use a signature instead and explained: We Fujianese only use fingerprints when selling our wives and children. I cannot put my fingerprints on these pieces of paper that I cannot understand. The police officer ignored my statement and first fiercely dragged my son to put his fingerprint, but I stopped him. Another policeman said fiercely: You are so tough, do you think I dare not hit you? On this day, they did not complete the procedures for me because of this.”
	More than twenty overseas Chinese students applying to return to China were forced to give one hundred fingerprints each.
		When someone refused, the prosecutor roared, "Don't let him return to China!"
	Another returned overseas Chinese student, Zhu Kairong, from Samarinda, said that on April 26th, when they, more than twenty overseas Chinese students, went to complete the procedures for returning to China, the authorities actually demanded that each of them give one hundred fingerprints. He said: "We asked why we had to give so many? An official actually said in a threatening tone, you can give one, but you will not be able to return to the motherland because of this. At that time, classmate Wei Guohua refused to give so many fingerprints and walked away in anger. Prosecutor Hamzah immediately roared in front of us, 'Remove his name and don't let him return to China.'"
	The authorities' officials rudely grabbed her finger, pressing it until the joints of her fingers ached.
	Yao Yuling, a 20-year-old overseas Chinese female student who recently returned on the "Tjiwangi" ship, said angrily: "This time when I went through the procedures to return to China, I not only gave one hundred or two hundred, but three hundred and six fingerprints!" Yao Yuling started to go through the procedures to return to China in mid-March. From Jember to Surabaya, she ran to eight institutions and spent more than a month to complete the procedures. Almost every procedure required fingerprints. At the Immigration Bureau of Jember County, she was forced to give one hundred and eight fingerprints.
	On March 26th, Yao Yuling came to the Surabaya National Security Bureau to complete the procedures. An Indonesian official in a brown uniform rudely grabbed her finger and repeatedly pressed eighty fingerprints on four sheets of white paper until the joints of her fingers ached, and he still did not let go. Yao Yuling asked: "We are overseas Chinese who are coming to return to our motherland, why do you want us to give so many fingerprints, treating us like criminals?" Another returned overseas Chinese, Zhu Wumei, not only gave countless fingerprints when completing the procedures at the Sutojayan Police Station, but the Indonesian officials of this station also asked her forty questions. Zhu Wumei said: "Most of these questions are unreasonable. They also asked me 'What are you doing back in China? Aren't you afraid of regretting it?' This is obviously an attempt to undermine our overseas Chinese's determination to return to China."
	Many returned overseas Chinese also revealed the facts that they were subjected to various insults, abuses, and inhumane treatment by the relevant Indonesian authorities when they were forced to give fingerprints. Some Indonesian military and police personnel even pushed and beat people at will. Chen Yamei, a returned overseas Chinese with four children, revealed: "That day, five hundred of us overseas Chinese waited to give fingerprints under the supervision of the military and police. We could have finished quickly, but they deliberately delayed the time and asked each overseas Chinese many repetitive and unreasonable questions. Even the source of a scar on an overseas Chinese's hand was asked for a long time. As a result, my children and I waited there for a whole day and a half, and the youngest child was only two years old, and also suffered this crime." Returned overseas Chinese female student Chen Xinde also revealed the despicable behavior of some Indonesian military and police personnel, who grabbed the arms of overseas Chinese women to put fingerprints, taking the opportunity to insult them.
	A group of Palembang overseas Chinese also encountered the same obstruction and harassment when completing the procedures for returning to China. Chen Wan, an old overseas Chinese, and his family of seven started to go to the Palembang Prosecutor's Office to complete the procedures on March 23rd, and it took them three days just to put their fingerprints. Returned overseas Chinese Chen Tianzong said that the measures taken by the relevant authorities in the Palembang area to force overseas Chinese to put their fingerprints were carried out under the instructions of the Indonesian Supreme Prosecutor's Office.

    今年从印度尼西亚归国的侨胞揭露
    归国华侨一再遭受人格侮辱
    像对待囚犯一样对待侨胞，无穷无尽地强迫按指印
    新华社23日讯　今年从印度尼西亚归国的华侨，揭露了印度尼西亚有势力集团强迫华侨盖大量手指印，粗暴地侮辱华侨人格，并且借此来阻挠他们回到祖国的许多事实。
          一家十五口人，每人要按七十二个手印
    归侨林石玉等揭露说：“4月22日，我到实叻班让警察局办理回国手续，警察局竟要我全家大小十五口人一齐来办手续，每个人要盖七十二个手印，并当即拿出一张印着印度尼西亚文的纸片要我盖手印，我要求以签字代替，并且说明：我们福建人只有在卖妻子儿女时才盖手印，我不能在这些我看不懂的纸片上盖手印。那个警官不理我的申说，首先凶狠地强拉我的儿子去盖印，被我制止后，另一个警察凶狠狠地说：你这样强硬，难道我不敢打你？这一天，他们竟因此不给我办理手续。”
  二十几个华侨学生申请回国，每人被强迫盖一百个手印。
      当有人拒绝时，检察官咆哮说：“不让他回国！”
    另外一个来自三马林达的归侨学生朱凯荣说，4月26日他们二十几个华侨学生去办理回国手续的时候，当局竟要他们每人按一百个手指印。他说：“我们问为什么要按这样多？一位官员竟用恐吓的口吻说，你盖一个也可以，不过你会因此回不了祖国。当时韦国华同学即拒绝盖这么多手印，并气愤得走了。检察官哈姆扎立即当着我们咆哮说，‘去掉他的名字，不让他回国。’”
    当局官员粗暴地抓着她的手指，按得她的指头关节发痛
    最近乘“芝万宜”轮船回国的二十岁的华侨女学生姚玉玲气愤地说：“我这次办回国手续时，不止盖一百个、二百个，而是盖了三百零六个手指印！”姚玉玲是3月中旬开始办理回国手续的。从任抹到泗水，她一共跑了八个机构，费了一个多月时间才把手续办完。几乎每办一道手续都要盖手指印。在任抹县的移民局，她就被强制盖了一百零八个手指印。
    3月26日，姚玉玲来到泗水国家安全局办理手续，一个穿着棕色制服的印度尼西亚官员粗暴地抓着她的手指反复地在四张白纸上按了八十个手指印，直到她的指头关节发痛还不放手。姚玉玲问道：“我们是要来回到自己祖国的华侨，为什么要我们盖那么多手指印，把我们当作犯人一样看待？”另一位归侨朱伍妹在徐图利组县警察局办手续时不仅盖了数不清的手指印，这个局的印度尼西亚官员还向她提出了四十个问题，朱伍妹说：“这些问题多半是毫无道理的。他们还问我‘回国做什么？你不怕后悔吗？’这显然是企图破坏我们华侨回国的决心。”
    很多归侨还揭露了他们在被迫打手指印时，受到了印度尼西亚有关当局各种侮辱、虐待和不人道待遇的事实。一些印度尼西亚军警人员竟随意推人、打人。有四个孩子的归侨陈亚妹揭露说：“那天我们五百名华侨在军警监视下等着打手印，本来很快可以打完，但是他们故意拖延时间，挨个向每一个华侨提出许多重复的、无理的问题，连一位华侨手上疤痕的来源也被问了好久。于是，我和孩子们整整在那里等了一天半，最小的孩子才两岁，也跟着受这个罪。”归侨女学生陈新德还揭露了有些印度尼西亚军警人员，捉住华侨妇女的手臂去按手指印，借机侮辱她们的卑鄙行为。
    一批巨港华侨在办理回国手续时也受到同样的阻挠、刁难。老华侨陈万一家七个人3月23日开始到巨港检察署办手续，仅仅为了打手指印就花了三天时间。归侨陈天总说，巨港地区有关当局强制华侨打手指印的措施，是奉印度尼西亚最高检察署的指示行事的。
