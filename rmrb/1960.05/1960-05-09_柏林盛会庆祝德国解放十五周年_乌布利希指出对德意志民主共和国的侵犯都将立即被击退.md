Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 7th: A grand celebration was held in Berlin tonight to mark the fifteenth anniversary of Germany's liberation from Fascist enslavement.

    The celebration was jointly organized by the Central Commitee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic, and the National Council of the National Front of Democratic Germany.

    Party and state leaders of the German Democratic Republic, including Ulbricht, Grotewohl, and Dieckmann, the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party, Reimann, the Soviet delegation headed by Ustinov, and diplomatic envoys from the Soviet Union and other countries attended the celebration. More than five thousand representatives from all walks of life attended the celebration meeting.

    Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of German and First Deputy Premier of the Republic, spoke at the meeting.

    Ulbricht emphasized that anyone who advocates peace must also advocate the conclusion of a German peace treaty signed by both German states.

    In his speech, he called on the United States, Britain, and France to recognize the fact that the occupation status of West Berlin and the stationing of foreign troops do not contribute to peace and understanding. He pointed out that whether Western countries are willing to turn West Berlin into a demilitarized free city is a yardstick to measure their willingness to peacefully resolve the German question.

    Ulbricht said that after the defeat of Hitler's fascism fifteen years ago, a new era began in German history. The Soviet Union's victory over Hitler's Germany was the result of the superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system. The Soviet people made huge sacrifices in the fight to crush fascism, which increased our gratitude and the friendship between the German and Soviet peoples.

    Ulbricht pointed out that the German Democratic Republic has learned the basic lessons of the two world wars. In the struggle to eradicate militarism and Nazism, the anti-fascist democratic movement developed and strengthened under the leadership of the working class. The working-class party not only established an alliance with all anti-fascist democratic forces in the Soviet occupation zone, but also strived to organize a similar alliance throughout Germany in order to contain militarism.

    Ulbricht, reviewing the developments in West Germany over the past fifteen years, pointed out that the state in this region was not the result of national self-determination, but was imposed on the people of West Germany. It is a violation of the Potsdam Agreement. He said that the importance of the establishment of the first peaceful Germany—the German Democratic Republic—is clearly visible today, and it is an important factor in the struggle against the resurgence of West German militarist aggression. Therefore, strengthening the ties between the entire people of West Germany and the German Democratic Republic will be beneficial to them. He drew attention to the many proposals put forward by the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union on the German peace treaty, which were not only opposed by the three Western powers, but also by the leaders of the West German Social Democratic Party, who, due to their ridiculous anti-communist ideas, have compromised with Adenauer.

    Ulbricht pointed out that the Bonn government insists that the Western countries should only undertake obligations within the scope of the Paris Agreement at the summit meeting, attempting to carry out a new Munich conspiracy. Ulbricht warned that Bonn should remember that the freedom of the German Democratic Republic is guaranteed by the Warsaw Pact, and any attempt to infringe upon the territory of the German Democratic Republic will be immediately repelled.

    He also said that the most powerful force for peace in Germany is the political and moral unity of the people of the German Democratic Republic.

    After Ulbricht's speech, Ustinov, head of the Soviet delegation, First Secretary of the Moscow City Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, spoke. On behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the Soviet government, and the people, he congratulated the German people on the fifteenth anniversary of their liberation from Fascist enslavement.

    Ustinov also spoke about the current easing of international tensions as a result of a profound change in the balance of power, due to the tremendous growth in the strength of the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries in recent years, and due to the increased international significance of the liberated countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Ustinov said that influential forces in the West advocate peace in words, but in fact oppose international relaxation and are doing their best to maintain the Cold War. These forces even dare to engage in provocations. The recent wanton violation of the Soviet border by American aircraft proves this. He said that the people of the world will not be deceived by those hypocritical words of love for peace.

    柏林盛会庆祝德国解放十五周年
    乌布利希指出对德意志民主共和国的侵犯都将立即被击退
    据新华社柏林7日电　今天晚间，柏林举行盛大的庆祝会，庆祝德国从法西斯奴役下解放十五周年。
    庆祝会是由德国统一社会党中央委员会、德意志民主共和国部长会议、民主德国全国阵线全国委员会联合组织的。
    德意志民主共和国的党和国家领导人乌布利希、格罗提渥、狄克曼，德国共产党中央委员会第一书记雷曼，以乌斯季诺夫为首的苏联代表团，以及苏联和其他国家的外交使节等都出席了庆祝会。出席庆祝会的各界代表共有五千多人。
    德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记、共和国第一副总理乌布利希在会上讲了话。
    乌布利希强调说，凡是主张和平的人，也必然会主张缔结有两个德国签字的对德和约。
    他在讲话中要求美国、英国和法国认识到这样一个事实，即西柏林的占领状态和驻扎外国军队并无助于和平与谅解。他指出，西方国家是否愿意把西柏林变为非军事化自由城市是衡量它们是否愿意和平解决德国问题的标尺。
    乌布利希说，十五年前在希特勒法西斯失败以后，德国的历史开始了一个新纪元。苏联对希特勒德国的胜利是社会主义制度比资本主义制度优越的结果。苏联人民在粉碎法西斯的战斗中作出了巨大的牺牲，这增进了我们感激的心情和德苏两国人民的友情。
    乌布利希指出，德意志民主共和国吸取了两次世界大战的基本教训。在根除军国主义和纳粹主义的斗争过程中，反法西斯的民主运动在工人阶级领导下有了发展和加强。工人阶级政党不仅同苏占区所有反法西斯的民主力量建立了联盟，并且还一直力争在整个德国组织一个类似的联盟，以便遏制军国主义。
    乌布利希回顾西德过去十五年的事态发展时指出，这个地区的国家不是全民自决的结果，而是强加于西德人民的。它是违反波茨坦协定的。他说，成立第一个和平的德国——德意志民主共和国的重要性在今天是清楚可见的，它是反对西德军国主义侵略意图复萌的斗争中的重要因素。因此，西德全体人民加强同德意志民主共和国的联系将是对他们有利的。他促请人们注意德意志民主共和国和苏联就对德和约提出的许多建议，这些建议不仅遭到西方三个国家的反对，而且遭到西德社会民主党领袖的反对，这些人由于自己可笑的反共思想，已同阿登纳妥协了。
    乌布利希指出，波恩政府坚持，西方国家在最高级会议上只应当承担像巴黎协定范围内的那样的义务。企图进行新的慕尼黑阴谋。乌布利希警告说，可是，波恩应当记得，德意志民主共和国的自由是得到华沙条约保障的，侵犯德意志民主共和国领土的任何企图都将立即被击退。
    他还说，德国最强大的和平力量是德意志民主共和国人民在政治上和道义上的团结。
    在乌布利希讲话后，苏联代表团团长、苏联共产党莫斯科市委第一书记、苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员乌斯季诺夫讲话。他代表苏共中央、苏联最高苏维埃、苏联政府和人民祝贺德国人民从法西斯奴役下解放十五周年。
    乌斯季诺夫还谈到目前国际紧张局势的和缓是力量对比发生了深刻变化的结果，是由于苏联、中国和其他社会主义国家的实力在最近几年有了巨大增长，是由于亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲获得解放的国家的国际意义变大了。乌斯季诺夫说，西方有影响的势力口里主张和平，但是实际上反对国际缓和，他们正在尽力保持冷战状态。这些势力甚至敢于进行挑衅。最近美国飞机对苏联边界的肆意侵犯就证明了这一点。他说，世界人民是不会受那些爱好和平的虚伪言词所欺骗的。
