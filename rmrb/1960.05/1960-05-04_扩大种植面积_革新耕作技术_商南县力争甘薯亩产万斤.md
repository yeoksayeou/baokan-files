Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 3rd: Shangnan County, Shaanxi Province, is innovating sweet potato planting techniques, striving for a yield of 10,000 jin per mu. Currently, after a long drought, the county has launched a high tide of seizing the moisture to plant sweet potatoes, expanding the sweet potato planting area to 60,000 mu, equivalent to 20% of the grain crop area. The area of ​​sweet potato high-yield ditches, high-yield ridges, high-yield bays, high-yield slopes, and high-yield fields that have been cultivated in various places totals 38,000 mu, accounting for more than 63% of the total sweet potato land area.

Members are doing everything possible to overcome various difficulties and prepare for planting seedlings. In order to expand the planting area, the county has restored more than 30,000 mu of abandoned farmland, repaired river滩地, and reclaimed wasteland. They have summarized the experience of high-yield sweet potatoes in recent years, vigorously innovated sweet potato planting techniques, trained seedling raising technicians, and changed winter bed seedling raising to warm bed seedling raising. The seedling raising date is also more than 20 days earlier than in previous years. All sweet potato fields are deeply ploughed more than one chi deep, and about 15,000 jin of fertilizer is applied per mu. All of them are ditched and ridged. Ridging can not only resist drought and preserve moisture, but also prevent waterlogging. After the sweet potato vines grow, it is convenient to carry out field fertilization, weeding, and vine lifting, without harming the potato seedlings. Generally, 3,000 to 4,000 nests are planted per mu on flat land, and 5,000 to 6,000 nests can be planted in ridges. According to local experience, under the same conditions, the yield of ridging is about 30% higher than that of planting seedlings on flat land.

    扩大种植面积　革新耕作技术
    商南县力争甘薯亩产万斤
    据新华社西安3日电　陕西商南县革新红薯（即甘薯）种植技术，力争亩产万斤。目前正久旱逢雨，全县已经掀起了抢墒栽种红薯的高潮，把红薯种植面积扩大到六万亩，等于粮食作物面积的20％。各地已经培育的红薯丰产沟、丰产梁、丰产湾、丰产坡、丰产田的面积共三万八千亩，占薯地总面积的63％以上。
    社员们千方百计克服种种困难，做好栽秧前各项准备工作。为了扩大种植面积，全县共已恢复弃耕地、修补河滩地、开垦荒地三万多亩。他们总结了几年来红薯高额丰产的经验，大力革新红薯种植技术，训练了育苗技术员，改冬床育苗为温床育苗，育苗的日期也比往年提前二十多天。全部红薯地都深翻一尺以上，每亩施肥一万五千斤左右，全部开沟作垅。垅作既可以抗旱保墒，又可以防涝，红薯蔓子长起后，便于进行田间施肥、除草、提蔓等工作，不会伤害薯苗。平地栽秧一般一亩栽三千到四千窝，垅作可栽五千到六千窝。根据当地经验，垅作在同样条件下，产量比平地栽秧高30％左右。
