Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, 29th - During the meeting of the Burmese Chamber of Deputies, parliamentarians warmly supported the agreement between China and Burma on boundary issues and the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression, and strongly refuted the unfounded criticisms of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Agreement raised by some parliamentarians.

Tehkin Tin Tun, a parliamentarian from the Federal Alliance who supported the agreement and the treaty, said that the signing of the agreement and the treaty was not only good news for the Burmese people, but also a step forward in strengthening the friendly relations between the Chinese and Burmese people. He pointed out that this achievement was the result of the sincere efforts made by the leaders of the two countries to resolve border issues through peaceful negotiations, and it was also a model for resolving border issues.

Tehkin Tin Tun pointed out that the provision in the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression on resolving border disputes between the two countries through peaceful negotiations is correct and an important way to solve problems between the two countries.

In his speech, he also praised the correct and courageous attitude of the Prime Ministers of China and Burma in resolving the Sino-Burmese border issue.

Federal Alliance parliamentarian Deng Mao expressed his support for the Sino-Burmese agreement on border issues and the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression. He said that mutual understanding and cooperation between the two countries would further promote Sino-Burmese friendly relations. The settlement of the Sino-Burmese border issue will be appreciated by the world. He said that this fact proves that although Burma is a small country, it has the courage to accept what is right.

Duwa Sinwa Nawng, Minister of Kachin State Affairs, said that after the signing of the Sino-Burmese agreement and treaty, people of all nationalities in Burma held mass rallies to express their support. This gives a strong rebuttal to those who spread rumors to create dissatisfaction with the Sino-Burmese Boundary Agreement. He also pointed out that judging from the notes exchanged between the Chinese government and the British government in the past, it is clear that Pianma, Gulang and Gangfang are Chinese territories.

U Tazan, a parliamentarian from the Shan State Mountain People's Organization, said that the signing of the Sino-Burmese agreement and treaty was a success of the two countries' good-neighborly policy. He pointed out that the Shan people wholeheartedly support the Sino-Burmese agreement and treaty.

Minister of Justice U Ai Mao severely refuted in his speech a parliamentarian's claim that the Sino-Burmese Boundary Agreement violated the Federal Constitution. He pointed out that the Sino-Burmese agreement and treaty signed by General Ne Win on behalf of the Union of Burma are legal and effective.

Meng Bo Qiao, a parliamentarian from the Mon People's Front, refuted a parliamentarian's claim that Pianma, Gulang and Gangfang belong to Burma.

Former Kachin State Affairs Minister U Zanta Hsin was the only parliamentarian who opposed the Sino-Burmese agreement during the vote. However, he was severely refuted by other parliamentarians.

Prime Minister U Nu reiterated in summarizing the discussion that the Sino-Burmese Boundary Agreement is fair and reasonable. He said that this agreement is in the interests of the people of both China and Burma, and therefore is greatly welcomed by the Burmese people.

Xinhua News Agency, Kathmandu, 29th - Nepal Radio broadcast the full text of the Sino-Nepalese Treaty of Peace and Friendship and the joint communiqué of the two governments on the evening of the 29th.

Many families in Kathmandu listened to this important news. People crowded around book stalls to buy the day's newspapers. The newspapers were snapped up in a very short time.
