Xinhua News Agency, May 6th, Ankara Dispatch: Approximately four thousand students, staff, and civil servants in Ankara, the capital of Turkey, held a demonstration on May 5th. On Atatürk Avenue in Ankara, they intercepted the car of Turkish dictatorial government Prime Minister Menderes, waving their fists and demanding his resignation.

As Menderes drove along this street to confer with Turkish President Bayar, he was intercepted by angry demonstrators three times, despite heavy protection from police and cavalry who repeatedly fired shots to intimidate the crowds. He stepped out of his car and ordered the demonstrators to disperse, but the masses responded by shouting, "Menderes, resign!"

The demonstration, held in defiance of martial law, lasted for an hour and a half. Dozens of demonstrators, including students from the Military Medical Academy, were arrested.

Menderes was blocked by demonstrators while driving through the capital with his Minister of the Interior, Gedik, and Minister of Education, Banderlioglu. At the time, he was pale, with a worried expression. Surrounded by police, he loudly asked the demonstrators, "What do you want? What do you want?" The demonstrators shouted, "Resign, resign!" His subordinates pushed him back into the car. Surrounded by the angry demonstrators, the car could only move slowly.

Menderes' car was forced to stop again after traveling two blocks. He got out of the car again, his hair disheveled and his shirt untucked, and shouted, "Why are you demonstrating? What is all this for?"

At the same time, the police fired shots into the air, attempting to disperse the crowds, and the cavalry charged towards the masses. However, the masses remained fearless, holding their ground, and shouted, "Resign, resign!"

Menderes changed to another car and drove a few blocks through the crowd. He continued to hear the jeers and calls for his "resignation" from the demonstrators.

He changed to a third car, which finally managed to carry him to the presidential residence on a small hill overlooking the capital.

At a time when the people of Ankara's sentiment against the United States and the Menderes regime is rising, Lieutenant General Cemal Gürsel, Commander of the Turkish Ground Forces, suddenly announced his resignation on May 5th. At the time of his resignation, the general had already been forced to take leave. The reason for his forced leave was not announced.

In a farewell speech to his troops, he said, "At this moment when a political storm is sweeping the country, know how to protect yourselves from being infected by this unfavorable atmosphere. Do not participate in politics under any circumstances."

To cope with the current situation, the Turkish Ministry of National Defense had already ordered the cancellation of annual leave for officers on May 4th.

Xinhua News Agency, May 6th, Istanbul Dispatch: Despite the extremely brutal suppression by the Turkish Menderes government, and the prohibition of gatherings of more than three people in Istanbul, students in Istanbul continued to hold anti-government demonstrations today.

Students from many schools took advantage of breaks between classes today to hold scattered, small-scale demonstrations against the Menderes fascist government. They shouted slogans demanding Menderes' resignation.

On May 5th, approximately three hundred students from Istanbul University held a demonstration against the reactionary Menderes government on the "Kara Deniz" (Black Sea) ship. They were on their way home by ship after Istanbul University was closed by the authorities. At the time, the ship was sailing towards Izmir.

After the demonstration broke out, the Menderes dictatorial government immediately ordered the ship to return to Istanbul and arrested all the students, transporting them to military barracks in military trucks. Sixty of the demonstrators were female students.

In the capital, Ankara, yesterday four thousand students, staff, and civil servants also held a demonstration using clever methods. They gathered in a square through a pre-arranged verbal code. To demonstrate and resist the military police of the Menderes government, they also specially composed a song.

The song says:

　　Is it possible?
　　Brothers killing brothers!
　　Down with all dictators!
　　Is the earth yours?

According to Western news agencies, in the face of the patriotic students' just demonstrations, the traitorous Prime Minister Menderes actually resorted to hooligan tactics. He ran into the demonstration and beat several students, brazenly saying, "Why don't you kill me?" However, the demonstrators were not intimidated by the Menderes government's army suppression and all means, and continued to persist in the march.

Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, May 5th: Approximately sixty Turkish students held a demonstration in Munich today to protest against the Menderes government.

The demonstrators held up signs, supporting the patriotic actions of students in Turkey and mourning the students who were killed in the demonstrations.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, May 5th: The International Student Union sent a telegram to Turkish Prime Minister Menderes, strongly protesting the Turkish authorities' persecution of Turkish students who are marching and demonstrating. The telegram expressed support for the Turkish students and demanded that the Turkish authorities stop suppressing student measures and release all arrested students. (Attached picture)

The people of Istanbul are in high spirits during the large-scale anti-tyranny demonstration, breaking through the reactionary authorities' armed suppression, and carrying their injured companions forward.　　　　　　　　Xinhua News Agency Draft

    不怕法西斯镇压　群起包围独裁者
    安卡拉示威群众当面喝令曼德列斯辞职
    伊斯坦布尔学生继续举行示威　在慕尼黑的土耳其学生声援国内学生斗争
    新华社6日讯　安卡拉消息：土耳其首都安卡拉约四千名学生、职员和公务人员5日举行示威时，在安卡拉的阿塔图克大街拦住土耳其独裁政府总理曼德列斯的轿车，向他挥动拳头，要他辞职。
    当曼德列斯驱车经过这条街去和土耳其总统拜亚尔商谈时，尽管警察和骑兵严密加以护卫并连连开枪威吓示威群众，他仍有三次被愤怒的示威者拦住。他跨下汽车命令示威者散开，群众以高呼“曼德列斯辞职！”来回答他。
    不顾戒严法而举行的这次示威游行持续了一个半小时。有几十个示威者，其中包括军医学院的学生被捕。
    曼德列斯是在偕同他的内政部长杰迪克和教育部长班德利奥格卢驱车穿过首都时被示威者挡住的。当时，他面色苍白，愁眉苦脸，由警察团团围着，大声问示威者：“你们想干什么？你们想干什么？”示威者高呼：“辞职，辞职！”他的手下人把他推进汽车。在愤怒的示威群众的包围下，汽车只能缓缓开动。
    曼德列斯的汽车经过了两个街区以后又被迫停了下来，他再次从车里走了出来，头发凌乱，衬衫的下端拖了出来，他大声嚷道：“你们为什么要示威？这一切是为了什么？”
    同时，警察朝天开枪，企图驱散重重包围的群众，骑兵也向群众冲过去。但是群众仍毫无畏惧地坚守在原来的地方，他们也向他高呼：“辞职，辞职！”
    曼德列斯又换了一辆汽车，从人群中朝前行驶了几个街区。他还是听到示威群众向他发出的嘲笑和要他“辞职”的呼声。
    他换了第三辆汽车，这辆汽车最后才设法把他载到俯视首都的小山上的总统官邸。
    正在安卡拉人民反对美国、曼德列斯政权的情绪高涨的时候，土耳其地面部队司令杰马耳·古尔塞耳中将5日突然宣布辞职。在这位将军辞职的时候，他已经被迫休假。没有宣布他被迫休假的原因。
    他在向他的部队发表告别讲话中说，“在政治风暴席卷全国的这个时刻，要知道怎样使你们自己免受这种恶劣的气氛的感染。无论如何不要参与政治。”
    为了对付当前的局势，土耳其国防部4日已经下令取消了军官每年的例假。
    新华社6日讯　伊斯坦布尔消息：尽管土耳其曼德列斯政府进行极端残暴的镇压，在伊斯坦布尔禁止三人以上的集会，但是伊斯坦布尔学生今天继续举行了反政府示威。
    许多学校的学生今天利用课间休息的时间，举行了分散的小规模的反对曼德列斯法西斯政府的示威。他们喊出要求曼德列斯辞职的口号。
    5日，大约三百名伊斯坦布尔大学的学生在“卡拉·德尼兹号”轮船上举行了反对曼德列斯反动政府的示威。他们是在伊斯坦布尔大学被当局封闭之后乘船回家的。当时这艘船正向伊兹密尔方向航行。
    在爆发示威之后，曼德列斯独裁政府立即命令这艘船返回伊斯坦布尔，并且把这些学生一律逮捕起来，用军用卡车把他们运到兵营里去。这些示威者中有六十名是女学生。
    在首都安卡拉，昨天四千名学生、职员和公务人员也用巧妙的方法举行了示威游行。他们通过事先约好的口头暗号在一个广场集合。为了示威游行和抵抗曼德列斯政府的军警，他们还特别编了一首歌曲。
    这首歌说：
    难道是可能的事？
    兄弟竟枪杀兄弟！
    打倒所有独裁者！
    地球岂是你们的东西？
    据西方通讯社报道，在爱国学生的正义示威面前，卖国总理曼德列斯竟然耍起流氓手段。他跑到示威队伍中，殴打了几个学生，并且撒赖说：“你们为什么不杀死我？”但是示威群众并没有被曼德列斯的军队镇压和一切手段吓倒，继续坚持游行。
    新华社波恩5日电　约有六十名土耳其学生今天在慕尼黑市内举行游行示威，反对曼德列斯政府。
    示威者高举标语牌，声援在土耳其的学生爱国行动，并且对在示威中被杀害的学生表示哀悼。
    新华社布拉格5日电　国际学生联合会打电报给土耳其总理曼德列斯，强烈抗议土耳其当局迫害游行示威的土耳其学生。电报中表示支持土耳其学生，并要求土耳其当局停止镇压学生的措施并释放一切被捕的学生。（附图片）
    伊斯坦布尔人民在反暴政大示威中斗志昂扬，冲破反动当局的武装镇压，抬着受伤的同伴继续前进。　　　　　　　　新华社稿
