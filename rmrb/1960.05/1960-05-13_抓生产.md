    Grasp Production
    Wu Lü
    Today's newspaper brings many good tidings of a flying start in early May. At Anshan Iron and Steel, the output of various products such as steel, iron, and steel materials has been increasing day by day during the grand technical performance competition week. In Shanghai, various steel plants have further shortened smelting time. In Chongqing, the output of steel and steel materials has been rising steadily. In Fuxin, Kailuan, Jiaozuo and other coal mines, there are also double harvests in coal mining and tunneling. These many good news all fill people with greater confidence in completing and overfulfilling this year's national plan.
    From these reports of factories and mines seizing a bumper harvest in production in early May, people can obtain an important experience: the continuous leap forward in production depends on "grasping." Moreover, grasping production now has more favorable conditions compared to the past. This is because the rich achievements of the technical innovation and technical revolution movements have provided sharp weapons for the continuous leap forward in production. The new processes, new technologies, and new equipment created in the technical innovation and technical revolution movements have solved many technical problems in the continuous leap forward in production. In the Liujiaba Converter Steel Plant of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, the average daily output of steel in early May increased by 24% compared with the same period in April. An important reason for this was the technical transformation of the pig iron furnace, changing the original hot blast alkaline pig iron furnace to a new type of pig iron furnace. The rapid application of similar innovation projects to production can also achieve good results in promoting the continuous development of production. The advanced leadership methods summarized in the technical innovation and technical revolution movements, such as technical performance competitions, grasping production with one hand and grasping preparation with the other, have also provided good leadership experience for organizing the continuous leap forward in production. The adherence of enterprises such as Anshan Iron and Steel and Zibo Mining Bureau to these advanced leadership methods and their achievements in production are proof of this.
    Our current task is to better combine the great technical innovation and technical revolution movement with the completion and overfulfillment of the national plan, fully utilize the rich achievements of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, and promote the continuous leap forward in production. The purpose of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement is to promote the development of production; the need for production development is the huge driving force of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. Production is the most vital cause for the broad masses; production key is the issue of greatest concern for the broad masses; production development is the most fundamental interest for the broad masses. Combining the technical innovation and technical revolution movement with the completion of current production tasks will better mobilize the masses, enable the technical innovation and technical revolution movement to achieve greater results, and enable production tasks to be completed better. This principle is very obvious. However, some comrades easily neglect it in the past. They are enthusiastic about innovation and creation, but neglect to better combine it with production, and thus sometimes there is such a situation: tens of thousands of innovations and creations are made, but they are not fully applied to production. This is certainly a loss for better completing production tasks; for the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, all the flowers of innovation and creation, divorced from the soil of production practice, are difficult to keep blooming.
    Fully utilize the rich achievements of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, vigorously grasp current production, and use the "arrow" of technical innovation and technical revolution to shoot the "target" of production, there will be a greater upsurge in production, and the technical innovation and technical revolution movement will have greater achievements.

    In the battle to seize iron and guarantee steel, leading cadres of the Anshan Iron and Steel Ironmaking Plant went to the forefront of production to participate in and lead production, greatly promoting the improvement of production levels. This is Meng Tai, the deputy director of the ironmaking plant and a famous national veteran hero, and the workers in front of the furnace studying how to achieve high output even with low iron content.

    抓生产 
    吴滤
    今天的报纸，带来了许多5月上旬开门红的捷报。在鞍钢，规模盛大的技术表演竞赛周中，钢、铁、钢材等各项产品的产量逐日提高，在上海，各个钢厂都进一步缩短了冶炼时间；在重庆，钢和钢材的产量都节节上升；在阜新、开滦、焦作等各个煤矿，也都是采煤掘进双丰收。这许许多多的好消息，都使人对完成和超额完成今年的国家计划更加充满了信心。
    从这些厂矿夺取5月上旬生产丰收的报道中，人们可以得到一条重要的经验：生产的持续跃进，要靠“抓”。而且，现在抓生产，同过去比较起来，有了更多的有利条件。这是因为技术革新和技术革命运动的丰富成果，已经为生产的持续跃进提供了锐利的武器。技术革新和技术革命运动中创造出来的新工艺，新技术，新设备，解决了许多生产持续跃进中的技术上的问题。重庆钢铁公司刘家坝转炉炼钢厂，5月上旬钢的平均日产量比4月同期提高了24％，重要原因就是对化铁炉进行了技术改造，将原来的热风碱性化铁炉改为新型化铁炉。类似这类的革新项目迅速应用于生产，也同样能收到促进生产持续发展的良好效果，技术革新和技术革命运动中总结出来的先进的领导方法，例如技术表演赛、一手抓生产一手抓准备等等，也为组织生产的持续跃进提供了很好的领导经验，鞍钢和淄博矿务局等企业坚持这些先进的领导方法，在生产上取得良好的成绩，就是证明。
    我们现在的任务，就是要把伟大的技术革新和技术革命运动，同完成和超额完成国家计划更好地结合起来，充分运用技术革新和技术革命运动的丰富成果，促进生产的持续跃进。技术革新和技术革命运动的目的，本来就是为了促进生产的发展；生产发展的需要，则是技术革新和技术革命运动的巨大的动力。生产，是广大群众最切身的事业；生产关键，是广大群众最关心的问题，生产发展，是广大群众最根本的利益。把技术革新和技术革命运动同完成当前生产任务结合起来，就能更好地发动群众，使技术革新和技术革命运动得到更大的成果，使生产任务完成得更好。这个道理，本来是非常明显的。不过，也有少数同志容易忽视过去。他们热心于革新创造，却忽视了更好地同生产相结合，因而有时出现这样的情形：革新创造成千累万，却并没有充分运用到生产中去。对于更好地完成生产任务说来，这固然是一种损失；对于技术革新和技术革命运动说来，一切革新创造的花朵，脱离了生产实践的土壤，也是很难久开不败的。
    把技术革新和技术革命运动的丰富成果充分运用起来，大抓当前生产，以技术革新和技术革命之“矢”，射生产之“的”，生产将有更大的高潮，技术革新和技术革命运动将有更大的成果。
