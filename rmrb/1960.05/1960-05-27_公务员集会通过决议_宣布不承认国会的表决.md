    Civil Servants' Rally Passes Resolution
    Declaring Non-Recognition of National Assembly Vote
    Three thousand government officials in Japan held rallies on the morning of the 26th and passed resolutions demanding the immediate resignation of the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet and the dissolution of the National Assembly, and opposing the visit of the US President to Japan. The resolutions passed at these rallies protested the atrocities of the Kishi Nobusuke government and the Liberal Democratic Party in forcibly voting on the new Japan-US "Security Treaty" in the House of Representatives, and declared non-recognition of the National Assembly's vote and decisions. These civil servants worked in the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Education, and the National Personnel Authority of the Japanese government. They held rallies in front of their respective agency buildings. Those who attended the rally denounced Nobusuke Kishi for having degenerated into a dictator like Syngman Rhee, and firmly stated that they would fight to the end to safeguard democracy.
    Socialist Party member of parliament Shichiro Matsumoto and Communist Party member of parliament Goro Suto attended the rally of the All-Japan Federation of Agricultural and Forestry Ministry Workers' Unions. Shichiro Matsumoto strongly condemned the atrocities of the Nobusuke Kishi group in the National Assembly at the meeting. Goro Suto refuted the statement made by US Ambassador to Japan Douglas MacArthur II on the 24th, pointing out that this proved that US imperialism was the mastermind behind Nobusuke Kishi.

    公务员集会通过决议
    宣布不承认国会的表决
    日本政府机关公务员三千人26日早晨在他们分别举行的大会上通过决议，要求岸信介内阁立即下台和解散国会，并且反对美国总统访问日本。在这些集会上通过的决议抗议岸信介政府和自由民主党在众议院强行表决新日美“安全条约”的暴行，并且宣布不承认国会的表决和决定。这些公务员分别在日本政府的农林省、大藏省、文部省和人事院工作。他们在所属机关大厦前面举行了大会。参加大会的人痛斥岸信介已经没落到成为与李承晚同样的独裁者的地步，并且坚决表示为维护民主他们将斗争到底。
    社会党议员松本七郎和共产党议员须藤五郎出席了全农林工会公务员的集会。松本七郎在会上强烈谴责岸信介集团在国会中的暴行。须藤五郎驳斥了美国驻日本大使麦克阿瑟第二在24日发表的声明，指出这证明了美帝国主义是岸信介的幕后人。（附图片）
