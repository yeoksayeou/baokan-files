Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 18th. Some right-wing newspapers in India are making every effort to cover up the crimes of U.S. imperialism in sabotaging the Four-Power Summit Conference and are attacking the Soviet Union's just and stern stance on this conference.

The Hindi newspaper "Hindustan Daily" attacked Khrushchev for giving "so much importance" to the spy plane incident, slandering Khrushchev's arrival in Paris as "sabotaging the summit meeting." It also claimed that Khrushchev's speech and the postponement of Eisenhower's visit to the Soviet Union were "very rude and rash."

"The New India Times" used vicious words such as "a blow to world peace," "stubborn," "unpeaceful action," and "forgetting all lofty principles" to insult Khrushchev. It not only reversed black and white, shifting the responsibility for the U.S. sabotage of the Four-Power Summit Conference to the Soviet Union, but also claimed that this "will not only damage its prestige, but the hope for world peace will become a bubble."

"The New India Times," on the one hand, praised aggressive U.S. imperialism as having a "spirit of peace," and on the other hand, slandered China, which advocates the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, for "occupying Indian territory."

"The Indian Express," in today's editorial, slandered that "the tone, mood, and wording used by Khrushchev at the summit meeting were more harmful to the meeting than the spy (plane) incident he complained about," while describing the U.S. plane's espionage activities, which aroused public outrage around the world, as a "far less important provocation."

This newspaper also repeated the slanderous claim that China "occupied" Indian territory.

"The Hindustan Standard" also reversed black and white, saying that Khrushchev's insistence on a just and stern stance was hoping to "exploit the current military advantage." On the other hand, it called "Eisenhower's approach," which insisted on an aggressive stance, "reasonable" and "sincere." This newspaper further covered up for U.S. imperialism, saying that "if the Soviet Union had not treated Eisenhower so aggressively, we see no reason why he would be unwilling to make the kind of guarantee Khrushchev wanted. But the attitude of demanding such a guarantee is indeed shocking."

Today's "The Hindustan Times" slandered Khrushchev's statement as "affected anger." It even demanded that the Soviet Union adopt a "restrained" attitude and be guided by "reason rather than emotion."

The Indian Press Trust also slandered Khrushchev in a telegram on the 17th as "taking the first step to sabotage the meeting," attacking the Soviet Union for "intimidation from a position of strength."

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 18th. After the U.S. ruling clique persisted in its aggressive policy and sabotaged the Four-Power Summit Conference, some right-wing newspapers in India are employing tricks to slander the Soviet Union and attempt to whitewash the United States.

"The Hindustan Standard" published an editorial on the 18th, saying, "Mr. Khrushchev is responsible for the collapse of the talks because he took a decisive step in refusing to talk with the West."

This newspaper also slandered Khrushchev's stern statement in Paris as "making a fool" of Eisenhower and his Western allies.

"The Statesman" cried out today in commenting on the reasons for the collapse of the Four-Power Summit Conference that Khrushchev had "gone too far," and said that "unless Khrushchev suddenly and drastically changes his attitude," "there is not much hope of saving the summit conference." After Eisenhower announced that he would not abandon his aggressive policy, but would only temporarily "suspend" spy flights until January 1961, this newspaper immediately supported Eisenhower, saying that "he has already ordered the cessation of reconnaissance flights."

    印右翼报纸大捧帝国主义
    认为侵略成性的美帝国主义具有“和平精神”
    诬蔑苏联“破坏”四国会议　攻击中国“侵略”印度
    新华社新德里18日电　印度一些右翼报纸竭力为美帝国主义破坏四国首脑会议的罪行掩饰，并攻击苏联对这个会议所采取的严正立场。
    印地文“印度斯坦日报”攻击赫鲁晓夫对间谍飞机事件给予“这么大的重视”，诬蔑赫鲁晓夫到巴黎是“破坏最高级会议”。还说什么赫鲁晓夫演说和推迟艾森豪威尔访问苏联的日期是“非常粗鲁和轻率的。”
    “新印度时报”使用了“对世界和平的打击”、“顽固的”、“不和平的行动”、“忘记了一切崇高的原则”等等恶毒词句来辱骂赫鲁晓夫。它不仅颠倒黑白地把美国破坏四国首脑会议的责任转嫁到苏联身上，还说什么这“不仅将有损它的威信，而且世界和平的希望将成为泡影。”
    “新印度时报”一方面把侵略成性的美帝国主义捧为是有“和平精神”的，另一方面诬蔑倡导和平共处五项原则的中国“占领印度领土”。
    “印度快报”在今天的社论中诽谤说，“赫鲁晓夫在最高级会议上采用的语气、情绪和措辞，比他所抱怨的间谍（飞机）事件对会议更有害”，而把引起世界公愤的美国飞机的间谍活动说成是“远为次要的挑衅”。
    这家报纸也重复所谓中国“占领”印度领土的谰言。
    “印度斯坦旗报”也颠倒黑白，把赫鲁晓夫坚持的严正立场说成是希望“利用目前的军备优势。”而把坚持侵略立场的“艾森豪威尔的做法”说成是“合理的”和有“诚意”的。这家报纸进一步为美帝国主义掩饰，说什么“如果苏联不那么气势凶凶地对待艾森豪威尔的话，我们看不出他有什么理由不愿意作出像赫鲁晓夫所希望的那种保证。但是要求这种保证的态度的确惊人”。
    今天的“印度斯坦时报”诬蔑赫鲁晓夫发表的声明是“装腔作势的愤怒”。他甚至要苏联采取有“节制”的态度，“不受感情而受理智”的引导。
    印度报业托辣斯在17日的一条电讯中也诽谤赫鲁晓夫“采取了破坏会议的第一个步骤”，攻击苏联“从实力地位出发进行恫吓”。
    新华社新德里18日电　印度一些右翼报纸在美国统治集团坚持侵略政策、破坏了四国首脑会议之后，正施展伎俩大肆诬蔑苏联，企图为美国洗刷。
    “印度斯坦旗报”18日发表社论说“赫鲁晓夫先生要对会谈的垮台负责，因为他采取决定性步骤，拒绝同西方会谈。”
    这家报纸还诬蔑赫鲁晓夫在巴黎发表的严正声明是“作弄”艾森豪威尔和他的西方盟国。
    “政治家报”今天在评论四国首脑会议垮台的原因时大叫赫鲁晓夫“做得过火”了，并且说什么“除非赫鲁晓夫突然、剧烈地改变态度”，“否则就没有多大希望挽救最高级会议。”这家报纸在艾森豪威尔宣布了不放弃侵略政策，而只是在1961年1月以前暂时“停止”间谍飞行的立场以后，这家报纸立刻为艾森豪威尔捧场，说“他已经下令停止侦察飞行了”。
