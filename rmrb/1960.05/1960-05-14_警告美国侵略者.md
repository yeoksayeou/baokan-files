    Warning to the American Aggressors
    By a Commentator of this Newspaper

    On May 11th and 13th, U.S. Navy patrol planes twice intruded into the airspace over Yongxing Island in the Xisha Islands of Guangdong Province. The spokesperson of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been instructed to issue the 95th and 96th serious warnings regarding this provocation by U.S. military aircraft. The Chinese people cannot but express extreme indignation at the crimes of U.S. imperialism in repeatedly carrying out military provocations against our country.

    However, a spokesperson for the U.S. State Department shamelessly denied the provocative act of intruding into the airspace over our Xisha Islands and openly denied our territorial sovereignty over the Xisha Islands. The spokesperson of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement today, severely denouncing this bandit-like behavior of the American aggressors. The Xisha Islands have been Chinese territory since ancient times, with both irrefutable historical facts and undeniable legal basis. Although the Xisha Islands were occupied by Japan during World War II, these islands were returned to the then Chinese government on November 27, 1946, after Japan surrendered. The American aggressors cannot obliterate the facts recognized by the whole world, and the Chinese people will never allow anyone to infringe upon our country's sacred sovereignty over the Xisha Islands.

    For a long time, the U.S. government has continuously dispatched military aircraft and ships to intrude into our territorial waters and airspace. The warnings issued by our government alone amount to as many as ninety-six times from September 1958 to the present. Among them, the U.S. has intruded into the Xisha Islands nineteen times in less than a year. Disregarding the repeated warnings of the Chinese government and the angry condemnation of the Chinese people, the American aggressors deliberately continue to infringe upon China's sovereignty. We must solemnly warn the American aggressors that all these accounts are recorded one by one and will eventually be settled. If the American aggressors insist on being enemies with the Chinese people and insist on carrying out military provocations against our country, then it can only make its own "debt tower higher and higher" and will hardly escape the final punishment.

    The recent incident of American aerial bandits intruding into the Soviet Union has once again made the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism clear to the people of the world. Although the U.S. government was unable to deny it this time, with the evidence and the perpetrator caught red-handed, and had to be forced to admit its aggressive crimes, U.S. President Eisenhower and Secretary of State Herter both publicly announced to the world that this bandit behavior of the U.S. imperialists was "justified"! It is not only not ashamed of this crime but also indicates that it will continue to do so, continue to carry out military provocations against the Soviet Union and China, and continue to carry out criminal activities that undermine peace. Shortly after the U.S. aircraft intrusion into the Soviet Union was exposed, and just as the U.S. government was being angrily condemned by peace-loving people all over the world, it actually continuously sent military aircraft to intrude into China's airspace. This powerfully proves that the U.S. government's bandit policy will not change.

    It is worth noting that this intrusion of Chinese airspace by U.S. aircraft is by no means an isolated incident. This is a planned action by U.S. imperialism to deliberately carry out war provocations in the Far East in order to intensify the world's tense situation. On the same day that this incident occurred, U.S. imperialism's chieftain Eisenhower reiterated at a press conference the imperialist stance of the United States in interfering in China's internal affairs and obstructing the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan and coastal islands, and clamored that the United States "must participate" in "defending Formosa." U.S. officials also clamored on the same day that the U.S. Seventh Fleet "bears the responsibility of safeguarding the security of the South China Sea" and wants to carry out some kind of "patrol" in this area, and so on. These facts further demonstrate that as long as the aggressive forces of U.S. imperialism exist in the Western Pacific, the source of tension in the Far East cannot be eliminated for a single day, and the peace of Asia and the world will be constantly and severely threatened. Therefore, strengthening unity, strengthening the struggle, and driving U.S. imperialism out of the Western Pacific is the common responsibility of the Chinese people, the Japanese people, and the people of all Asian countries in defending the cause of world peace.

    警告美国侵略者
    本报评论员
    5月11日和13日，美国海军巡逻机两次侵入我广东省西沙群岛的永兴岛上空。我外交部发言人已经奉命就美国军用飞机的这种挑衅提出了第九十五次和第九十六次严重警告。中国人民对于美帝国主义一再向我国进行军事挑衅的罪行，不能不表示极大的愤慨。
    但是，美国国务院发言人竟然无耻地抵赖侵入我西沙群岛领空的挑衅行为，并公然否认我对西沙群岛的领土主权。我国外交部发言人今天发表了谈话，严斥美国侵略者的这种强盗行径。西沙群岛自古以来就是中国的领土，既有确凿不移的历史事实，又有不可颠扑的法律依据。虽然在第二次世界大战中，西沙群岛曾被日本占领过，但是日本投降后，这些岛屿已于1946年11月27日归还当时的中国政府。美国侵略者是不可能抹煞全世界所公认的事实的，中国人民绝不允许任何人侵犯我国对西沙群岛的神圣的主权。
    长时期以来，美国政府不断派遣军用飞机和舰只侵犯我国的领海和领空，仅仅就我国政府提出的警告而言，从1958年9月起到现在就达九十六次之多。其中在不到一年之内，美国对西沙群岛的侵犯就有十九次。美国侵略者不顾中国政府的一再警告和中国人民的愤怒谴责，蓄意继续侵犯中国的主权。我们必须正告美国侵略者，所有这些账都一笔一笔地记下来了，是终有一天需要算清的。如果美国侵略者坚持与中国人民为敌，坚持向我国进行军事挑衅，那么只能使它自己“债台高筑”，绝难逃脱最后的惩罚。
    最近美国空中强盗侵犯苏联的事件，使全世界人民再一次看清了美帝国主义的侵略本质。尽管美国政府这一次在人赃俱获的情况下无法进行狡赖，只得被迫招认了自己的侵略罪状，但是，美国总统艾森豪威尔和国务卿赫脱都公开向全世界宣布，美帝国主义者的这种强盗行为是“正当”的！它不仅不以这种罪行为耻，而且表示还要干下去，还要继续向苏联和中国进行军事挑衅，还要继续进行破坏和平的罪恶活动。在美机侵苏事件刚刚被揭发不久，正当美国政府遭到全世界爱好和平人民愤怒谴责的时候，它竟然连续派遣军用飞机侵犯中国的领空，这就有力地证明，美国政府的这种强盗政策是不会改变的。
    值得警惕的是，美机这一次侵犯中国的领空决不是孤立的事件。这是美帝国主义蓄意在远东进行战争挑衅，以加剧世界紧张局势的一个有计划的行动。就在这个事件发生的同一天，美帝国主义的头子艾森豪威尔在记者招待会上重申美国干涉中国内政、阻挠中国人民解放台湾和沿海岛屿的帝国主义的立场，并且叫嚷美国“必须参加”“保卫福摩萨”。美国官员也在同一天叫嚣美国第七舰队“负有保卫南中国海安全的责任”，并要在这个地区进行什么“巡逻”，等等。这些事实进一步表明，只要美帝国主义的侵略势力在西太平洋存在一天，远东紧张局势的根源就一天不能消除，亚洲和全世界的和平就会受到经常的严重的威胁。因此，加强团结，加强斗争，把美帝国主义赶出西太平洋去，这是中国人民、日本人民和亚洲各国人民对于保卫世界和平事业所肩负的共同的责任。
