Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, 8th - According to reports in local newspapers: Enver Hoxha, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, said on the 7th that today, there are still forces in the world attempting to intensify the international situation, weaken, and divide the unity of socialist camp countries. In this regard, revisionists, especially Yugoslav revisionists, are playing a dirty role.

Hoxha said: The Albanian Labor Party is completely united with all other Marxist-Leninist parties, and our party will wage an uninterrupted struggle against the Belgrade revisionists. We should continue to fight to defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism.

Hoxha made these remarks while visiting the leaders of industry, agriculture, and culture and education departments in the Shkodër region of northern Albania. In this conversation, Hoxha talked about some international issues.

He said that the current international situation has improved, and the supporters of the "Cold War" policy have been defeated and will continue to be defeated. This is due to the Soviet government's pursuit of a policy of peace and the existence of the great and invincible strength of the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union. In this speech, Hoxha talked about Khrushchev's speech at the Fifth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, saying that this speech once again demonstrated the Soviet government's position on important issues of current world concern, such as disarmament and Germany.

Hoxha also talked about Albania's agricultural production. He pointed out that currently, rain is hindering the progress of spring planting. All possible measures should be taken to overcome this situation.

Hoxha pointed out that Albania is expanding its cultivated area and carrying out huge soil improvement work. He also said that agricultural mechanization is not everything; first of all, it is necessary to inspire workers' love for labor, and agricultural workers should be well led and organized, and attention should be paid to increasing the yield per unit area of crops, especially grain.

He said that the tasks facing the Albanian working people during the Third Five-Year Plan are huge, but these tasks have been carefully studied and are well-founded. Efforts should be made to complete and overfulfill these tasks.

He also said that every Communist Party member and worker should fight against the remnants of the bourgeoisie.

    霍查号召继续保卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性
    永不间断地对修正主义者进行斗争
    每个共产党员和劳动者都应同资产阶级残余势力作斗争
    新华社地拉那8日电　据此间报纸报道：阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会第一书记霍查7日说，今天，世界上还存在着企图加剧国际局势、削弱和分裂社会主义阵营国家团结的势力。在这方面，修正主义者，特别是南斯拉夫修正主义者，起着肮脏的作用。
    霍查说：阿尔巴尼亚劳动党是同其他所有马克思列宁主义政党完全团结在一起的，我们党将永不间断地进行反对贝尔格莱德修正主义者的斗争。我们应当继续为保卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性而斗争。
    霍查是在阿尔巴尼亚北部的斯库台区访问时对那里的工、农业和文教部门的领导干部讲话时这样说的。在这次谈话中，霍查谈到了一些国际问题。
    他说，目前国际局势有了改善，“冷战”政策的支持者遭到了失败，并将继续遭到失败，这是由于苏联政府执行和平政策，由于存在着以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的巨大的不可战胜的力量。霍查在这次讲话中谈到赫鲁晓夫在苏联最高苏维埃第五次会议上的演说，他说，通过这一个演说，再一次表明了苏联政府对当前世界所关心的重要问题如裁军、德国等问题所持有的立场。
    霍查还谈到了阿尔巴尼亚农业生产问题。他指出，目前，雨水妨碍了春播工作的进行。应当采取一切可能的措施来战胜这种情况。
    霍查指出，阿尔巴尼亚正在扩大耕地面积和进行巨大的土壤改良工作。他又说，农业机械化并不等于一切，首先要鼓舞劳动者对劳动的热爱，应当好好地领导和组织农业劳动者，应当注意提高农作物、特别是粮食的单位面积产量。
    他说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动人民在第三个五年计划期间所面临的任务是巨大的，然而这些任务是经过仔细研究并且是有基础的。应当争取完成并且超额完成这些任务。
    他还说，每个共产党员和劳动者都应当同资产阶级残余势力作斗争。
