    Unite, People of China and Japan, Overthrow U.S. Imperialism!
    The Japanese people's struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty began yesterday with an unprecedented sixteenth unified action. Just as the Kishi Nobusuke clique is resorting to all kinds of despicable means in an attempt to force the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty through the Japanese Diet, the Japanese people have launched such a powerful and fierce resistance movement, which is of particular significance in combating the war and aggression policies of U.S. imperialism and the Kishi Nobusuke clique. Yesterday, more than one million people in our capital held an unprecedented rally, resolutely opposing the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty and expressing warm support and high respect for the Japanese people's persistent struggle and their fearless spirit in the face of the world's most ferocious enemy—U.S. imperialism and its follower, the Japanese reactionaries.
    The Japanese people's struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, which has been going on for more than a year, has been rising wave upon wave since its inception. The scale, duration, and breadth of participation are not only unprecedented in Japanese history, but also rare in the world. In the past fifteen unified actions, the number of participants has increased each time. The first unified action had one million people; the seventh unified action increased to seven million, and by the fifteenth unified action, the number of participants had increased to more than ten million, totaling fifty million. The participating classes are becoming more and more extensive. The vast numbers of workers, peasants, students, professors, scientists, lawyers, writers, artists, and small and medium-sized business owners have formed a torrent of struggle. Even Buddhists and Christians who rarely concern themselves with politics are increasingly joining the ranks of the struggle. The Japanese people's anti-U.S. patriotic united front against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty is rapidly expanding and strengthening. At present, more than two thousand organizations, including the Japanese Communist Party, the Socialist Party, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, and people from all walks of life, have been established nationwide as part of the National Conference to Prevent the Ratification of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." These organizations are not only spread throughout the prefectures, but also penetrate into towns, villages, and even some remote tribes. The struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty has become a national mass movement in Japan. It is closely linked with the Japanese people's demands for the removal of U.S. military bases, opposition to nuclear weapons, opposition to the revival of militarism, and striving for the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China, as well as the struggle of people from all walks of life to safeguard their livelihoods and democratic rights, promoting each other and developing in a magnificent manner.
    The Japanese people's unwavering determination to oppose the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, the broad range of classes participating in the unified action, and the fierce development of the struggle situation, despite the bloody suppression and threats from the U.S.-Japan reactionaries, are by no means accidental. This is because the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, which aims to prepare for new aggression and war, fundamentally violates the interests of the Japanese people from all walks of life; because the Japanese people, who have experienced the scourge of militarism, can no longer tolerate the Japanese reactionaries following U.S. imperialism and driving them back into the abyss of new war disasters. The Japanese people deeply know that the Japanese militarist forces, which have waged external aggressive wars in the East for half a century, not only caused unprecedented war disasters to the people of China and other Asian countries, but also brought great disasters to the Japanese people. During World War II alone, two million young Japanese men died or were disabled, leaving behind millions of war widows and orphans. Japan is the only country in the world to have suffered from atomic bombs. The atomic bombs dropped by the United States on Hiroshima and Nagasaki took the lives of hundreds of thousands of Japanese people and left millions more still under the threat of death and suffering. The Japanese people have tasted the bitter consequences of aggressive wars, how can they sit idly by and watch the revival of Japanese militarism! However, U.S. imperialism, which is plotting to dominate the Far East and the world, has openly abandoned international agreements since the end of the war, actively controlled Japan, and revived Japanese militarism. U.S. imperialism violated the Potsdam Agreement and, through the one-sided Treaty of Peace with Japan signed in San Francisco in 1951 and the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," allowed U.S. troops to occupy Japan for a long time, established military bases all over Japan, and intensified the rearmament of Japan. The semi-military occupation by the United States originally put the Japanese nation in an unprecedentedly humiliating position, and the U.S. policy of reviving Japanese militarism brought even greater suffering to the Japanese people. The United States plundered Japan's wealth on a large scale. From the post-war period to this year alone, Japan has paid nearly six billion U.S. dollars just to cover the expenses of the U.S. occupation forces. The U.S. military bases all over Japan not only infringe upon Japan's sovereignty, but also occupy the rice paddies on which Japanese farmers depend for their livelihood, and are also centers for criminal activities such as smuggling, drug trafficking, and prostitution. Extraterritoriality allows the U.S. military to infringe upon Japan's sovereignty and endanger the lives of the Japanese people with impunity. The Japanese people have even become live targets for U.S. soldiers to shoot at will. According to incomplete statistics, from the post-war period to 1957 alone, there were as many as 100,000 cases of crimes and injuries committed by the U.S. military in Japan. In order to meet the needs of the United States in preparing for new aggression and war, Japan has established armed forces in the name of "self-defense"; Japan's major industries have been reorganized into military industries. Now, with the conclusion of the Japan-U.S. military alliance, the United States is further binding Japan to its war chariot. The original purpose of the United States is to openly implement nuclear armament in Japan, incorporate Japan into the U.S. atomic strategy system, and turn Japan into its nuclear war base; and to form a Northeast Asian military alliance with Japan as the core, completing its military group network in Asia to threaten socialist countries and suppress national independence movements. According to this treaty, Japan must not only submit to U.S. imperialism's world strategy militarily, politically, and economically, and lose its national sovereignty, but will also completely serve as a tool for U.S. war and aggression. In addition to helping the United States maintain military bases in Japan, the Japanese militarist forces will also help the United States carry out aggression and expansion outside Japanese territory, serving as a henchman for U.S. imperialism. Nobusuke Kishi openly stated that Japanese troops could be sent abroad to "attack enemy bases." And according to the Japanese government's interpretation of the treaty's applicable areas, it further shows that its aggressive spearhead is directed at China, the Soviet Union, Korea, and Vietnam, as well as many other countries in Asia. Obviously, the conclusion of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty is a serious threat to all peace-loving countries and people in Asia and the world, and the beginning of a new and great disaster for the Japanese people. Precisely for this reason, the Japanese people can only avoid being dragged onto the road of war, death, and disaster by resolutely smashing the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty.
    For more than a year, the Japanese people's surging, nationwide struggle has disrupted the Kishi Nobusuke government's timetable for attempting to pass the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty in the House of Representatives, and has struck a blow at the U.S.-Japan reactionaries' plot to plan a new war. The Japanese people have tempered and united themselves in the struggle against the ferocious enemy—the U.S.-Japan reactionaries. With one heart and one mind, the strong will of millions of Japanese people to oppose the Japan-U.S. military alliance, oppose the U.S.-Japan reactionaries' plot to plan a new war, and strive for independence, peace, democracy, and neutrality has formed an indestructible force. It is not the U.S.-Japan reactionaries who determine the fate of Japan, but the Japanese people! The Japanese people's struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty is a historically significant struggle related to the fate of the Japanese nation, a great struggle. The victory of this struggle will completely destroy the U.S.-Japan reactionaries' criminal plan to turn Japan into a base for aggressive war, and uproot the source of war of U.S. imperialism in Asia. Precisely for this reason, the U.S.-Japan reactionaries will not easily retreat, and they will surely carry out frantic struggles and continue to suppress the Japanese people's struggle. Therefore, the struggle facing the Japanese people is very arduous. However, this sharp and fierce struggle is a serious struggle to safeguard peace in Japan, safeguard peace in Asia, and safeguard world peace. Every step of its progress has a positive impact on the cause of world peace and is a powerful support for the struggle of the people of all countries in the world against U.S. imperialism; precisely for this reason, the Japanese people's struggle is not isolated, and it will receive the firm support of all peace-loving countries and people in the world, especially in Asia.
    In order to realize its ambition to dominate the world, U.S. imperialism carries out aggression and expansion, establishes military bases everywhere, and searches for national scum from various countries, supporting all the most reactionary and decadent forces in the world as accomplices in its colonial, aggressive, and war policies. With the help of these national scum, U.S. imperialism has turned Japan, South Korea, South Vietnam, the Philippines, Thailand, and Turkey into forward positions for the United States to launch wars. However, this evil policy of U.S. imperialism brings disaster to the people of all these countries, causing all oppressed people to gradually awaken from suffering and embark on the road of resolute struggle. Look, the Japanese people have risen up, the South Korean people have risen up, the Turkish people have risen up, and they are determined to fight for independence and democracy. The spearhead of every local struggle is directed at U.S. imperialism. Every victory of the struggle will disrupt U.S. imperialism's strategic deployment for launching a new war. The struggles of the people of all countries oppressed by U.S. imperialism are also just struggles to strive for world peace.
    The Chinese people have long suffered from the aggression of U.S. imperialism and Japanese imperialism, and have experienced the profound suffering caused by imperialist aggressive wars. In the eight-year war of aggression against China alone, Japanese militarism caused more than ten million Chinese people to lose their lives, and at least 50 billion U.S. dollars worth of property was destroyed and burned. The Chinese people will never allow the U.S.-Japan reactionaries to use the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty to launch a new aggression against China. At the same time, U.S. imperialism still occupies our territory of Taiwan and constantly carries out military provocations and war threats against our country. Therefore, the Chinese people have always regarded the Japanese people's struggle against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty as support for the Chinese people's struggle against U.S. imperialism, as a common struggle of the people of China and Japan, and as our own struggle. We sincerely hope that the fraternal Japanese people can get rid of American control as soon as possible and establish a new Japan that is independent, peaceful, democratic, and neutral. We firmly believe that although the road of struggle will be tortuous and the task will be arduous, final victory will ultimately belong to the great Japanese people. The tenacious will and heroic and unyielding fighting spirit displayed by the Japanese people in the struggle, vowing not to stop until the goal is achieved, are the guarantee of victory. This is something that U.S. imperialism and any reactionaries cannot overwhelm. The future of the Japanese people is full of light and hope.

### 中日两国人民团结起来，打倒美帝国主义！

    中日两国人民团结起来，打倒美帝国主义！
    日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争，从昨天开始了规模空前的第十六次统一行动。正当岸信介集团不惜采取一切卑鄙手段，企图在日本国会强行通过日美军事同盟条约的时候，日本人民掀起如此强大和猛烈的反抗运动，对于打击美帝国主义和岸信介集团的战争政策和侵略政策具有特别重大的意义。昨天，我国首都一百多万人民举行空前规模的集会，坚决反对日美军事同盟条约，并且对日本人民坚持不懈的斗争和他们在全世界人民最凶恶的敌人——美帝国主义及其追随者日本反动派面前表现的大无畏精神，表示热烈的支持和崇高的敬意。
    连续进行了一年多的日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争，从开始以来一浪高一浪，斗争的规模之大、时间之久、参加群众之广泛，不仅是日本历史上空前未有的，在世界上也是少有的。在过去的十五次统一行动中，参加的人数一次次地增多。第一次统一行动有一百万人；第七次统一行动即增加到七百万人，到十五次统一行动，参加人数已增加到一千万人以上。总共累计已达五千万人。参加的阶层越来越广泛，广大的工人、农民、学生、教授、科学家、律师、作家、艺术家和中小企业主组成了斗争的洪流，连平时很少过问政治的佛教徒和基督教徒，也越来越多地走进了斗争的行列。日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的反美爱国统一战线，迅速地扩大和加强。目前，全国建立的包括日本共产党、社会党、工会总评议会和各阶层人士的阻止批准日美“安全条约”国民会议的组织，已经达到两千多个。这些组织不仅早已遍布全国的都、道、府、县，而且深入到镇、村，甚至某些偏僻的部落。反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争，已成为日本全民性的群众运动。它同日本人民要求撤除美军基地、反对核武器、反对军国主义复活、争取恢复日中邦交以及各阶层人民维护生活和民主权利的斗争，紧密地结合在一起，互相促进，正在波澜壮阔地向前发展。
    日本人民不顾美日反动派的血腥镇压和威胁，反对日美军事同盟条约斗争的意志如此坚决，参加统一行动的阶层如此广泛，斗争形势的发展如此猛烈，绝不是偶然的。这是因为其目的在于准备新的侵略和战争的日美军事同盟条约根本违反日本各阶层人民的利益；因为历尽了军国主义祸患的日本人民，再也不能容忍日本反动派追随美帝国主义，把他们重新驱向新战争灾难的深渊。日本人民深深知道，在东方持续了半个世纪对外侵略战争的日本军国主义势力，不仅使中国和亚洲其他国家的人民遭到空前的战祸，也给日本人民带来了巨大的灾难。只在第二次世界大战期间，日本就有两百万青壮年死亡和残废，留下数以百万计的战争寡妇和孤儿。日本是世界上唯一的原子弹受害国，美国在广岛、长崎投下的原子弹，夺去了日本几十万人的生命，并使上百万人至今还处在死亡的威胁和病痛的折磨中。日本人民尝够了侵略战争后果的苦汁，怎么能坐视日本军国主义复活！但是，阴谋称霸远东和全球的美帝国主义，从大战结束以来就公然毁弃国际协议，积极控制日本，复活日本军国主义。美帝国主义违反波茨坦协议，通过1951年在旧金山签订的片面对日和约和日美“安全条约”使美军长期占领日本，在日本到处建立军事基地，并加紧重新武装日本。美国的半军事占领原来就使日本民族处于历史上从来没有过的屈辱地位，而美国复活日本军国主义的政策更为日本人民带来极大的痛苦。美国大量掠夺日本的财富，从战后到今年度，日本仅为负担美国占领军费用就付出了近六十亿美元。遍布日本全国各地的美军基地不但侵犯日本的主权，而且霸占了日本广大农民赖以生存的稻田，又是进行走私、贩毒、卖淫等罪恶行为的中心。治外法权使美军得以肆无忌惮地侵犯日本的主权、危害日本人民的生命。日本人民甚至成为美国兵恣意开枪的活靶子。据不完全的统计，仅从战后到1957年，美军在日本犯罪和伤害的暴行就达十万件。为了适应美国准备新的侵略和战争的需要，日本已经建立起以“自卫”为名的武装部队；日本的主要工业已改编为军需工业。目前由于日美军事同盟的缔结，美国进一步把日本绑到自己的战车上。美国原来的目的就是公开使日本实行核武装，把日本纳入美国的原子战略体系中，使日本变成它的核战争基地；并且形成以日本为核心的东北亚军事联盟，完成它在亚洲威胁社会主义国家和镇压民族独立运动的军事集团网。根据这个条约，日本不仅在军事上、政治上、经济上必须服从于美帝国主义的世界战略，丧失国家主权，而且将完全充当美国的战争和侵略工具。日本军国主义势力除了要帮助美国保持在日本的军事基地，还要帮助美国在日本领土以外进行侵略和扩张，为美帝国主义充当打手。岸信介露骨地声明，日本军队可以派到外国去“进攻敌人的基地”。而根据日本官方关于条约适用地区的解释，更说明它的侵略矛头是指向中国、苏联、朝鲜和越南，同时还指向亚洲的其他许多国家。显而易见，日美军事同盟条约的缔结，对于亚洲和全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民是严重的威胁，对于日本人民是一场新的巨大灾难的开始。正因为这样，日本人民只有坚决粉碎日美军事同盟条约，才可能避免被拖上战争、死亡、灾难的道路。
    一年多以来，日本人民的汹涌澎湃的席卷全国的斗争，打乱了岸信介政府企图在众议院通过日美军事同盟条约的时间表，打击了美日反动派策划新战争的阴谋。日本人民在同凶恶的敌人——美日反动派的斗争中，锻炼了自己，团结了自己。众志成城，千千万万日本人民反对日美军事同盟，反对美日反动派策划新战争的阴谋，争取独立、和平、民主和中立的坚强意志，结成了不可摧毁的力量。决定日本命运的，绝不是美日反动派，而是日本人民！日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争，是一场关系到日本民族命运的具有历史意义的斗争，是一场伟大的斗争。这一斗争的胜利，将彻底摧毁美日反动派把日本变成侵略战争基地的罪恶计划，连根拔掉美帝国主义在亚洲的战争策源地。也正因为如此，美日反动派是不会轻易退却的，它们一定会进行疯狂的挣扎，继续镇压日本人民的斗争。因而，日本人民面临的斗争是十分艰巨的。但是，这一场尖锐激烈的斗争，是维护日本的和平、维护亚洲的和平、维护世界和平的一场严重斗争，它的每一步进展都对世界和平的事业产生积极的影响，都是对于世界各国人民反对美帝国主义的斗争的有力的支持；也正因为这样，日本人民的斗争不是孤立的，它将得到全世界首先是亚洲所有爱好和平的国家和人民的坚决支持。
    美帝国主义为了实现它称霸全世界的野心，进行侵略和扩张，到处建立军事基地，到处搜罗各国的民族败类，扶植世界上一切最反动、最腐朽的势力，作为它推行殖民政策、侵略政策和战争政策的帮凶。依靠这些民族败类的帮助，美帝国主义把日本、南朝鲜、南越、菲律宾、泰国、土耳其变为美国发动战争的前进阵地。但是，美帝国主义这种罪恶政策，给所有这些国家的人民带来灾难，使一切被压迫的人民逐渐从苦难中觉醒起来，走上坚决斗争的道路。看吧，日本人民起来了，南朝鲜人民起来了，土耳其人民起来了，他们决心争独立、争民主。每一个地方斗争的锋芒，都针对着美帝国主义。每一处斗争的胜利，都将打乱美帝国主义发动新战争的战略部署。一切遭到美帝国主义压迫的国家的人民的斗争，同样都是争取世界和平事业的正义斗争。
    中国人民过去曾经长期遭受美帝国主义和日本帝国主义的侵略，历尽了帝国主义侵略战争所造成的深重苦难。单是在日本八年的侵华战争中，日本军国主义就使中国一千多万人丧失了生命，最少有五百亿美元以上的财产遭到破坏和焚毁。中国人民绝不允许美日反动派利用日美军事同盟条约对中国进行新的侵略。同时，美帝国主义至今仍霸占我国领土台湾，不断对我国进行军事挑衅和战争威胁。因此，中国人民一向把日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争，看成是对中国人民反对美帝国主义斗争的支持，看成是中日两国人民的共同斗争，看成是我们自己的斗争。我们衷心地愿望兄弟的日本人民能够早日摆脱美国控制，建立一个独立、和平、民主、中立的新日本。我们深信，尽管斗争的道路将会是曲折的，任务也是艰巨的，但是，最后胜利终将属于伟大的日本人民。日本人民在斗争中显示的不达目的誓不休止的顽强意志和英勇不屈的战斗精神，就是取得胜利的保证。这是美帝国主义和任何反动派所不能压倒的。日本人民的前途是充满着光明和希望的。
