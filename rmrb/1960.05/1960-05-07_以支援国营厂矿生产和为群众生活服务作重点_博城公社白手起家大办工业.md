Xinhua News Agency report: The Bocheng People's Commune in Zibo City, Shandong Province, starting from scratch, has vigorously developed industry, and production has developed rapidly over the past year. At present, the commune-run factories and mines have reached more than 20, with a total output value of more than 3 million yuan last year, and this year, the first quarter has jumped to 1.04 million yuan.

Bocheng is a small industrial city in Shandong Province with industries such as ceramics, coal, and chemicals. It is also the political, economic, and cultural center of Zibo City. According to statistics, among the city's population of more than 61,000, there are more than 34,000 employees and their families. During the Great Leap Forward and the Great Steel Smelting Movement in the autumn of 1958, the contradiction of insufficient labor appeared in various factories here. On the other hand, with the deepening development of the All-People Rectification Movement, the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of housewives has generally improved, and they are eager to get rid of trivial housework and participate in socialist construction. Under such circumstances, some street residents, under the leadership of the Party organization, began to organize production organizations such as "Labor Force Cooperatives," "Production Labor Force Cooperatives," and "Dismantling, Washing, and Sewing Groups" to participate in steel production and do some auxiliary production for factories. Chairman Mao's call of "The People's Commune is Still Good" clarified the direction for the people here and strengthened their confidence in taking the path of collectivization. According to the demands of the masses, the Bocheng Party organization established the Bocheng People's Commune on October 8, 1958.

After the establishment of the Bocheng Commune, according to the characteristics of abundant local resources and a wide range of production channels, and the requirements of the broad masses, it focused on developing industrial production for large-scale industry and serving the citizens, taking street residents and employees' families as the main body, and vigorously developing industry starting from scratch. Over the past year, these factories have grown from small to large, from indigenous to modern, and from producing single products to producing multiple products, and have developed greatly. The main products are 195 kinds, and they have supplied a large number of raw materials and parts to state-owned factories and mines. Last year, commune-run industries supplied more than 53,000 tons of refractory materials to 23 factories and mines such as the local Dingfeng Kiln, Beiling Kiln, Zibo Porcelain Factory, and Shentou Power Plant, and also processed mechanical parts worth more than 160,000 yuan for factories and mines such as Shandong Machine Factory and Jianhua Calcium Carbide Factory. When the commune-run Chengli Repair Factory was first established, it only had a furnace and two workers. Now it has developed to have 23 machines including three lathes, one drilling machine, two spring hammers, thread cutting machines, electric welding machines, blowers, and power engines, and 73 workers. At the beginning, this factory could only repair and make hoes, sickles, shovels, mattocks, and process simple parts. Now it can repair and assemble motors, blowers, and assemble radios. Last autumn, they processed and rushed to make more than 7,200 parts needed for high-voltage lines for the Zibo Power Supply Bureau, enabling the bureau to complete the construction of high-voltage lines from Zibo to Jinan on time. While serving local large-scale industries, commune-run industries also produced more than 20 kinds of daily necessities such as cosmetics, seasonings, bakelite buttons, brooms, and bamboo curtains, which were sold all over the country. This year, commune-run industries have made new developments, with a total output value of 1.04 million yuan in the first quarter. The output value of Chengli Repair Factory and Refractory Materials Factory in the first quarter of 1959 was more than 7,000 yuan, and this year it reached more than 330,000 yuan in the first quarter. The output value of Chengli Repair Factory in the first quarter of this year was 180,000 yuan, an increase of 59 times compared with 3,000 yuan in the same period in 1959, accounting for 78.6% of the total output value for the whole year of 1959.

The Bocheng Commune has also organized four agricultural production teams, cultivating 1,800 mu of land, and planting a large number of vegetables to supply the market. In 1959, the total income of agricultural production in the whole commune increased by 70% compared with 1958, and the vegetable production increased by 25%. Five pig farms were established to provide meat for the commune.

While developing production, the Bocheng Commune has established 21 canteens, 48 nursery organizations, and 42 service stations (groups). The result of vigorously developing collective welfare undertakings and service undertakings is that a large number of housewives have been freed from household chores and have invested in the cause of socialist construction. According to a survey in Xintan Street, before the establishment of the commune, less than 30% of the female labor force here participated in production, and after the establishment of the commune, almost all women with labor capacity participated in production.

After the establishment of the commune, cultural and health undertakings have also developed greatly. Now the whole commune has formed an education network composed of commune-run primary schools, spare-time middle schools, and crash-course red and expert technical schools, and a medical network composed of commune-run hospitals, maternity hospitals, and health stations and health workers. The commune also has four cultural centers and libraries.

After the establishment of the Bocheng Commune, the living standards of the commune members have generally improved compared with the past. Many women used to rely on their husbands or parents for their livelihoods, but now they have become self-reliant producers building socialism.

    以支援国营厂矿生产和为群众生活服务作重点
    博城公社白手起家大办工业
    据新华社讯　山东省淄博市博城人民公社，白手起家大办工业，一年多来生产有了迅速的发展。目前由公社举办的厂矿已经有二十多座，去年的总产值达三百多万元，而今年，第一季度更跃进到一百零四万元。
    博城是山东省一座有着陶瓷、煤炭、化学等工业的小型工业城市，又是淄博市政治、经济、文化的中心。据统计，这个有六万一千多人口的城市中，职工家属就有三万四千多人。在1958年秋季的大跃进和大炼钢铁运动中，这里的各个工厂中出现了劳动力不足的矛盾。另一方面，随着全民整风运动的深入发展，广大家庭妇女的社会主义觉悟普遍提高，她们迫切要求摆脱繁琐的家务劳动，参加社会主义建设。在这种情况下，有些街道居民在党组织的领导下，开始组织“劳力社”、“生产劳力社”、“拆洗缝纫组”等生产组织，参加钢铁生产和为工厂作些辅助性的生产。毛主席的“还是人民公社好”的号召，使这里的人们明确了方向，也更加坚定了走集体化道路的信心。中共博城党组织根据群众的要求，就在1958年10月8日成立了博城人民公社。
    博城公社建立以后，就根据当地资源多、生产门路广的特点和广大群众的要求，以街道居民、职工家属为主体，以发展为大工业、为市民服务的工业生产为重点，白手起家，大办工业。一年多来，这些工厂从小到大，从土到洋，从生产单一产品到生产多种产品，已经有了很大发展。主要产品有一百九十五种，并且为国营厂矿供应了大批原料和配件。去年社办工业向当地鼎丰窑厂、北岭窑厂、淄博瓷厂、神头发电厂等二十三个厂矿供应的耐火材料，就有五万三千多吨，还为山东机器厂、建华电石厂等厂矿加工了价值十六万多元的机械零件。公社办的城里制修厂刚成立时，只有一盘红炉、两个工人，现在已经发展到拥有三部车床、一部钻床、两部弹簧锤和割丝机、电焊机、鼓风机、电力发动机等二十三台机器、十盘红炉，有七十三名工人。开始时这个工厂只能修打锄、镰、锨、镢和加工简单配件，现在已能修配电动机、鼓风机和装配收音机。去年秋季，他们为淄博供电局加工赶制了七千二百多件高压线上需要的配件，使这个局按时完成了由淄博到济南的高压线架设任务。社办工业在为本地大工业服务的同时，还生产了化妆品、调味品、电木钮扣、扫帚、竹帘等二十多种日用商品，行销各地。今年，社办工业又有了新的发展，第一季度的生产总值达一百零四万元。城里制修厂和耐火材料厂1959年第一季度的产值是七千多元，今年第一季度就达到三十三万多元。城里制修厂今年第一季度产值是十八万元，比1959年同期的三千元提高五十九倍，为1959年全年总产值的78.6％。
    博城公社还组织了四个农业生产队，耕种着一千八百亩土地，大量种植蔬菜供应市场。1959年全社农业生产总收入比1958年增长70％，蔬菜生产量增长25％。建立了养猪场五处，为公社提供肉食。
    博城公社在发展生产的同时，举办了二十一处食堂、四十八处托儿组织，建立了四十二处服务站（组）。大办集体福利事业和服务事业的结果，使大量家庭妇女摆脱家务牵累，投入了社会主义建设事业。据新坛街的调查，公社成立前，这里的妇女劳动力参加生产的不到30％，公社成立后有劳动能力的妇女几乎都参加了生产。
    公社成立后，文化卫生事业也有了很大发展。现在全社已形成由社办小学、业余中学到速成红专技术学校组成的教育网，由社办医院、妇产院和保健站、保健员组成的医疗网。公社还设有文化馆和图书馆共四处。
    博城公社成立以后，社员们的生活水平普遍比过去有了提高。很多妇女过去依靠丈夫或父母生活，现在，都成了自力更生、建设社会主义的生产者。
