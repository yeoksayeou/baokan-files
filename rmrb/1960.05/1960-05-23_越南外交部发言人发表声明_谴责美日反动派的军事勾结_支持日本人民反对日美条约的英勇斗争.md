Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 22nd: The spokesperson of the Foreign Ministry of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement today regarding the Japanese House of Representatives' "passage" of the US-Japan military alliance treaty. The statement said that the Kishida Nobusuke government's hasty forcing of the US-Japan military alliance treaty through the Japanese House of Representatives, and the recent dispatch of reconnaissance planes by US imperialism to intrude into the Soviet Union's interior on the eve of the summit conference, prove that the imperialist warmongers, headed by the United States, are making every effort to intensify international tensions, prepare for war, and undermine world peace.

The statement said that the Vietnamese people and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, who suffered deeply from the atrocities committed by Japanese militarists in World War II and are currently being interfered with and obstructed by US imperialism in their cause of national reunification, deeply understand the crisis of the revival of Japanese militarism and the strengthening of the US-Japan military alliance. Therefore, they resolutely oppose the US-Japan military alliance treaty.

The statement said that the Vietnamese people fully sympathize with and support the increasingly fierce and heroic struggle of the Japanese people against the US-Japan military alliance treaty and against the rule of the Kishida Nobusuke clique. The Kishida Nobusuke reactionary government and US imperialism must bear full responsibility for the consequences of the US-Japan military alliance treaty.

The statement said that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that in the face of the collusion between US imperialism and Japanese militarists to realize their conspiracies of interference and aggression, the proposal of the Government of the People's Republic of China for the signing of a peace and non-aggression pact among the countries of Asia and the Pacific region must be realized in order to maintain peace in this region and the world.

    越南外交部发言人发表声明
    谴责美日反动派的军事勾结
    支持日本人民反对日美条约的英勇斗争
    新华社河内22日电　越南民主共和国政府外交部发言人，今天就日本众议院“通过”日美军事同盟条约发表声明说，岸信介政府匆忙迫使日本众议院“通过”日美军事同盟条约和美帝国主义最近在最高级会议前夕派遣侦察飞机侵入苏联内地这些事件证明，以美国为首的帝国主义好战分子正竭力加紧制造国际紧张局势，准备战争，破坏世界和平。
    声明说，在第二次世界大战中曾经饱受日本军国主义者制造的惨祸、目前正受到美帝国主义干涉和阻挠而不能实现国家统一事业的越南人民和越南民主共和国政府，深刻体会到日本军国主义的复活和加强日美军事联盟的危机，因此，坚决反对日美军事同盟条约。
    声明说，越南人民完全同情和支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约、反对岸信介集团统治的日益猛烈发展的英勇斗争。岸信介反动政府和美帝国主义对日美军事同盟条约所造成的后果，必须担负完全的责任。
    声明说，越南民主共和国政府认为，在美帝国主义同日本军国主义者互相勾结，以实现干涉和侵略阴谋的面前，中华人民共和国政府关于亚洲和太平洋区域各国之间签订和平和互不侵犯公约的建议必须得到实现，从而维持这个区域和全世界的和平。
