Xinhua News Agency, 7th. Due to the continuous southward movement of cold air, from May 2nd to the morning of May 7th, most parts of the country experienced rainfall. Some areas of Guangdong and Fujian experienced torrential rain.

In some areas of Northeast, Northwest, and North China, it has been raining for days. The drought situation in severely drought-stricken areas such as northern Shaanxi, eastern Gansu, southern Ningxia, and central Shanxi has been alleviated to some extent in areas with heavier rainfall. Among them, northern Shaanxi and central Shanxi had rainfall of 20 to 40 millimeters, with Yan'an having 44 millimeters and Taiyuan having 39 millimeters as relatively large. Eastern Gansu and southern Ningxia received another 10 to 15 millimeters of rain. Southern Shanxi, northern Henan, southern Hebei, and southwestern Shandong only received 5 to 15 millimeters of rain. Most areas of Hebei and Shandong, which have been suffering from drought for a long time, have still not received rain.

The Han River basin in southern Shaanxi, the Huai River basin, the Sichuan Basin, and most areas south of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River also experienced rainfall this time. Some individual areas had very heavy rain. Areas from east of the Pearl River Estuary in Guangdong to west of Xiamen in Fujian generally received more than 100 to 150 millimeters of rain, becoming a concentrated area of torrential rain. Among them, Shantou had 438 millimeters, and Puning even reached over 700 millimeters.

The relatively heavy rainfall in the northern regions this time is extremely beneficial to spring sowing, emergence of spring-sown crops, and winter wheat heading and grain filling. However, areas that have not received rain or have received little rain must continue to fight drought for spring sowing and protect seedlings. In eastern Guangdong, where torrential rain is concentrated, especially the Chaoshan Plain, tense flood prevention work has begun, and the local masses are fighting against torrential rain and flash floods.

    全国大部地区降雨
    据新华社7日讯　由于冷空气连续南下，从5月2日到7日上午，全国大部分地区都下了雨。广东和福建的部分地区降了暴雨。
    东北、西北、华北部分地区，连日以来都有雨，原来受旱严重的陕西北部、甘肃东部、宁夏南部、山西中部等地区，雨量较大的地方旱情有所缓和。其中陕西北部和山西中部雨量为二十毫米到四十毫米，以延安雨量四十四毫米，太原雨量三十九毫米为较大。甘肃东部和宁夏南部又下雨十毫米到十五毫米。山西南部、河南北部、河北南部、山东西南部仅下雨五毫米到十五毫米。河北和山东久感干旱的大部地区，仍未下雨。
    汉水流域陕南一带、淮河流域、四川盆地和长江中下游以南大部地区这次也下了雨。个别地区下雨很大。广东珠江口以东到福建厦门以西地区，普遍降雨一百到一百五十毫米以上，成为暴雨集中的地区。其中汕头四百三十八毫米，普宁竟达七百毫米以上。
    这次北方获雨较大地区对春播和春播作物的出苗以及冬小麦孕穗灌浆有极大的好处。但是，没有下雨和雨小的地区，仍须继续抗旱春播，抗旱保苗。南方暴雨集中的粤东，特别是潮汕平原，已开始紧张的防汛工作，当地群众同暴雨和山洪展开了搏斗。
