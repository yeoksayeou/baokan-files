Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 29th: Aidit, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party, delivered a speech on the evening of the 27th at a rally held here to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the Bandung Conference, entitled "Enhance Asian-African Vigilance and Strengthen Asian-African Solidarity with the Bandung Principles."

Aidit said that in the five years since the Bandung Conference, the Bandung spirit has continued to develop and has become increasingly consolidated. The Bandung spirit has achieved brilliant victories and has had a profound impact on international relations. The development of the international situation shows that the forces against imperialism and against colonialism are moving from victory to victory. Conversely, the imperialist and colonialist forces are disintegrating and constantly collapsing, drawing closer to their demise.

Aidit pointed out, after listing the recently signed Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression, the Sino-Nepalese Agreement on Border Issues, and the talks between the Premiers of China and India, that all difficulties and complex issues can be resolved as long as the Bandung spirit is respected and correctly implemented.

Aidit said that the Bandung spirit has promoted the continued advancement of the forces of independence and democracy in Latin America and has dealt a heavy blow to imperialism. Cuba is a brilliant example and powerful inspiration for the people of Latin America in their struggle to eliminate military dictatorship, defend democracy, and improve the domestic economy. The Cuban people have successfully defended the victories they have won in their struggle against U.S. imperialism.

Aidit pointed out that from the above facts, one can see that the claims by some people that the situation in Asia and Africa, Asian-African friendship, unity, cooperation, and solidarity have retreated, weakened, and become divided are incorrect. There are indeed some problems among Asian-African countries. As long as all parties concerned abide by the Bandung spirit, there is no problem that cannot be solved.

Aidit pointed out that imperialism is trying every possible means, using outdated to the latest, open, violent, covert and courteous, and coercive military actions to deception and enticement – attempting to preserve colonialist forces in the Asian-African region, creating divisions and spreading discord among Asian-African countries, and undermining friendship, cooperation, and solidarity among Asian-African countries. However, these vicious conspiracies of the imperialists have gone bankrupt in Asia, and in the land of Africa, the flames have already burned to their feet. Our responsibility is to constantly raise the vigilance of the people of Asian and African countries, safeguard the unity of the people of Asian and African countries, and actively and vigorously support the demands of the people of Africa and other countries for national independence.

Aidit pointed out that the experience gained by Cuba and other countries in the struggle against imperialism clearly shows that the seemingly powerful imperialism is not irresistible and cannot be defeated. If resistance is carried out, it will retreat.

He pointed out that if Indonesia wants to maintain its prestige as one of the initiators, host, and chairman of the Bandung Conference, especially if it hopes to pursue an independent foreign policy for independence and peace, it must learn from all these experiences.

Aidit pointed out that it seems that Indonesia must pay more attention to the activities of imperialism that threaten security and peace, and adopt a positive attitude against them. The Philippines, Indonesia's closest neighbor, will be turned into a nuclear base. This situation will bring disaster to the Indonesian people.

Aidit went on to say that in resolving the West Irian issue, Indonesia should adopt a clear attitude to replace the vague one. He also said that a clear attitude is also needed in dealing with other pressing issues, such as maintaining good-neighborly and friendly relations with China.

Aidit said that the imperialists are still busy carrying out activities in Indonesia, and they must be suppressed, resisted, and defeated with the strength of the people's unity, the actions of the people's masses, and the Bandung spirit and principles, rather than with sweet smiles.

He pointed out that the Bandung principles still show full vitality and are increasingly being promoted.

Aidit said that the imperialists hope that the Bandung principles will "die" and believe that the Bandung principles are "outdated." But history has proven in the past and present, and will continue to prove in the future, that what is "dead and outdated" is not the Bandung principles, but the imperialists themselves. Aidit concluded by saying that the people are preparing coffins to bury the imperialists in the grave.

    艾地在庆祝万隆会议五周年的集会上讲话
    加强亚非团结　警惕帝国主义阴谋
    只要尊重万隆精神亚非国家间一切困难和复杂问题都可解决
    据新华社雅加达29日电　印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会主席艾地27日晚上在这里举行的庆祝万隆会议五周年的集会上发表了题为“以万隆原则来提高亚非的警惕性和加强亚非团结”的讲话。
    艾地说，万隆会议以后五年来，万隆精神在继续发展并且日益巩固。万隆精神已经取得了辉煌的胜利，它对国际关系产生了深远的影响。国际局势的发展表明，反对帝国主义和反对殖民主义的力量正在从胜利走向胜利。相反地，帝国主义和殖民主义势力则分崩离析和不断瓦解，日益临近末日。
    艾地在列举最近签订的中缅友好和互不侵犯条约、中尼关于边界问题的协定，以及中印两国总理会谈以后指出，只要尊重万隆精神和正确执行万隆精神，一切困难和复杂问题都是可以解决的。
    艾地说，万隆精神推动了拉丁美洲争取独立、民主的力量的继续前进，并且沉重地打击了帝国主义。古巴是拉丁美洲人民在消灭军事独裁、保卫民主和改善国内经济的斗争中的光辉榜样和有力的鼓舞力量。古巴人民成功地保卫了他们在同美帝国主义进行的斗争中所赢得的胜利。
    艾地指出，从上述事实中，人们可以看到，某些人认为亚非的局势，亚非的友谊、统一、合作和团结后退了，削弱了，和发生了分裂，这些说法是不正确的。在亚非国家之间确实存在着一些问题。只要各有关方面遵守万隆精神，没有不能解决的问题。
    艾地指出，帝国主义正在千方百计地利用过时的到最新的、公开的、暴力的、隐蔽的和彬彬有礼的、以及强迫性的军事行动到欺骗和引诱等手段——企图在亚非地区保存殖民主义势力，在亚非国家之间制造分裂和散布不和，破坏亚非国家之间的友谊、合作和团结。但是，帝国主义者的这些恶毒阴谋在亚洲已经破产，而在非洲的土地上，火焰已经燃到了他们的脚上来了。我们的责任是不断提高亚非各国人民的警惕，维护亚非各国人民的团结，积极、大力支持非洲人民和其它国家的人民争取民族独立的要求。
    艾地指出，古巴和其他国家在反对帝国主义的斗争中所得到的经验，清楚地说明，貌似强大的帝国主义并不是不可抵抗和不能击败的。如果进行抵抗，它就会退却。
    他指出，印度尼西亚如果想保持作为万隆会议的发起国之一、东道国和主席的威信，特别是如果它希望为了独立和和平而奉行独立的外交政策，它就必须从所有这些经验中吸收教训。
    艾地指出，看来印度尼西亚必须更加注意威胁安全和和平的帝国主义的活动，并采取反对它们的积极的态度。同印度尼西亚共和国最接近的邻国菲律宾将被变成核基地。这种形势将给印度尼西亚人民带来灾难。
    艾地接着说，在解决西伊里安问题时，印度尼西亚应该采取明确的态度，以替代含糊的态度。他还说，在处理其他一些迫切问题，如同中国保持睦邻和友好关系的问题，也需要采取明确态度。
    艾地说，帝国主义者仍然忙于在印度尼西亚进行活动，必须用人民团结的力量、人民群众的行动以及万隆精神和原则，而不是用甜蜜的微笑来压迫、抵抗和挫败帝国主义。
    他指出，万隆原则仍然显示充分的生命力，并且日益发扬光大。
    艾地说，帝国主义者希望万隆原则将会“死亡”，并且认为万隆原则已经“过时”。可是历史在过去、现在都已经证明，将来也还要证明，“死亡和过时”的不是万隆原则，而是帝国主义者自己。艾地最后说，人民正在准备棺木，把帝国主义者葬入坟墓。
