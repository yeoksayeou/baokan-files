Xinhua News Agency, Havana, April 29th: Cuban Prime Minister Castro today condemned American interference in Cuba at a mass rally in Matanzas City attended by 30,000 people. He pointed out that the planes that set fire to the homes of Cuban farmers took off from the United States. The worst slanders against Cuba are issued from the United States. The United States provides money and materials to the enemies and war criminals of the Cuban Revolution, wanting to destroy the Cuban Revolution.

Castro made these remarks at a rally to hand over the Goicuria barracks to the Ministry of Education. The barracks, converted into a school, will be named the Goicuria Martyrs School.

In his speech, Prime Minister Castro said that Cuba is now stronger and has stronger defenses. He said that in the days to come, perhaps we will have to take up arms again, but if someone wants to invade us, it doesn't matter, we will fight and then continue the revolutionary cause. Those who want to invade our country will see that we will never let others take away what we are doing. We have the trust of the people, so we are not afraid.

At this time, the masses present shouted, "Defend the motherland to the death, long live the revolution!"

Prime Minister Castro turned to the children listening to him and said that revolution is about giving all children access to education, even if they are poor. Currently, 10,000 rural classrooms are being built. He emphasized that the revolution is just beginning. He said that the children already understand the revolution. This shows that when someone wants to take away the land of the farmers, then not only will the adults fight, but even the children will participate in the fight.

The children of Matanzas City saved their snack money to buy weapons and planes to defend the revolution. At this rally, a little girl named Roque, on behalf of all the children of Matanzas City, presented Prime Minister Castro with a donation of more than 500 pesos.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, April 30th: Cuban Foreign Minister Raúl Roa announced in a statement on April 29th that the Guatemalan government's decision to sever diplomatic relations with Cuba was unilateral.

Under the pretext that someone was preparing an invasion of Guatemala in Cuba, the Guatemalan government suddenly announced on the 28th that it would sever diplomatic relations with Cuba.

In the statement, Roa pointed out that the Guatemalan government's accusation was "baseless and provocative."

In the statement, Roa condemned Guatemalan President Ydígoras as announcing the severance of diplomatic relations with Cuba as a "provocative agent serving obscure anti-Cuban forces." The statement pointed out that the measure taken by the Guatemalan government is part of a foreign monopoly group-funded and supported international anti-Cuban conspiracy, and these foreign monopoly groups are trying in vain to prevent the development of the Cuban revolution and make it fail.

In the statement, Roa condemned Ydígoras for "providing all kinds of conveniences and subsidies to fugitive (Cuban) war criminals." The statement emphasized that the Guatemalan government must bear full responsibility for the current crisis.

    卡斯特罗谴责美国侵略古巴无恶不作
    古巴外长揭露危地马拉政府对古巴的挑衅行为
    新华社哈瓦那29日电　古巴总理卡斯特罗今天在马坦萨斯城一次有三万人参加的群众大会上谴责了美国对古巴的干涉。他指出，纵火焚烧古巴农民家宅的飞机是从美国起飞的。对古巴的最恶劣的诽谤是从美国发出的。美国为古巴革命的敌人和战犯提供金钱和物资，想摧毁古巴革命。
    卡斯特罗的这番话是在把戈伊库里亚兵营移交给教育部的集会上发表的。这所兵营改成的学校将命名为戈伊库里亚烈士学校。
    卡斯特罗总理在讲话中说，古巴现在的力量更大了，防御能力更强了。他说，在未来的日子里，也许我们要再次拿起武器，但是，如果有人要侵略我们的话，没有关系，我们将进行战斗，然后继续进行革命事业。那些要侵略我们祖国的人会看到，我们决不会让我们正在做着的东西再让别人夺走。我们有人民的信任，因此，我们并不害怕。
    这时，到会的群众高呼：“誓死保卫祖国，革命万岁！”
    卡斯特罗总理转向听他讲话的孩子们说，革命就是使所有的孩子都有文化，尽管他们是穷苦的。目前正在建设一万个农村课室。他着重指出，革命还正在开始。他说，孩子们已经懂得了革命。这就表明，到了有人想把农民的土地夺走的时候，到那时候，不仅是大人要去斗争，而且连小孩子也将参加斗争。
    马坦萨斯城的儿童积蓄下了他们的点心钱来购买武器和飞机来保卫革命。在这次集会上，小姑娘罗克代表马坦萨斯城所有的儿童向卡斯特罗总理献出了五百多比索的捐款。
    新华社哈瓦那4月30日电　古巴外交部长劳尔·罗亚在4月29日发表声明宣布，危地马拉政府关于同古巴断绝外交关系的决定是片面的。
    危地马拉政府在所谓有人正在古巴准备对危地马拉入侵的借口下，28日突然宣布同古巴断绝外交关系。
    罗亚在声明中指出，危地马拉政府的这种指责是“没有根据的和挑衅性的”。
    罗亚在声明中谴责危地马拉总统伊迪戈拉斯是作为“为阴暗的反古巴势力效劳的挑衅代理人”而宣布同古巴断绝外交关系的。声明指出，危地马拉政府采取的这个措施是外国垄断集团资助和支持的反古巴国际阴谋的一个组成部分，这些外国垄断集团徒劳地企图阻止古巴革命的发展并使它归于失败。
    罗亚在声明中谴责伊迪戈拉斯“为逃亡的（古巴）战犯提供各种便利和津贴。”声明强调指出，危地马拉政府必须承担造成目前危机的全部责任。
