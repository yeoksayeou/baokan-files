    Building Ships with Fiberglass and Steel Wire Mesh

    The Yiyang Ship Repair Factory in Hunan Province recently built a pontoon boat with a mixed structure of fiberglass, steel wire mesh, and concrete. This boat is 24.32 meters long, 6.9 meters wide, and 1.2 meters deep, with a draft of 0.5 meters. It uses only 6.72 tons of steel and 46 cubic meters of wood. This saves 76% of steel compared to steel ships and 65.7% of wood compared to wooden ships. This type of boat is easy to maintain, does not rust for a long time, and is not afraid of fire or insect damage.

    玻璃丝、钢丝网造船
    湖南省益阳船舶修理厂于最近造成一艘玻璃丝、钢丝网、混凝土混合结构趸船。这艘船型长二十四点三二米，宽六点九米，深一点二米，吃水零点五米，只用钢材六点七二吨、木材四十六立方米。比钢质船节约钢材76％，比木质船节约木材65.7％。这种船容易保养，长期不生锈，不怕燃烧起火和虫子蚀蛀。
