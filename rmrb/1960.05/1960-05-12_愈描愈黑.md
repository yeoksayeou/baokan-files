Title: The More One Tries to Cover Up, The More Conspicuous It Becomes

　　Washington has been in a state of chaos for days. White House officials are in a flurry due to world opinion condemning the US plane's invasion of Soviet airspace. The US State Department has repeatedly issued statements attempting to cover up the crime and exonerate itself, but the contradictions are numerous, putting the US government in an increasingly embarrassing situation.

　　On May 9, US Secretary of State Herter personally issued another statement to "supplement and clarify" the US government's attitude as expressed in the State Department's statement of May 7. In his statement, Herter openly declared: "According to the National Security Act of 1947, the President (Eisenhower) has put into effect, since the beginning of his administration, instructions to collect... the necessary (Soviet) intelligence by all possible means," "In accordance with these instructions, plans have been drawn up and implemented, including extensive aerial surveillance by unarmed civilian aircraft, which is normally conducted on the periphery, but sometimes goes inside."

　　Thus, the US Secretary of State has indeed clarified one point: the statement made by the State Department a couple of days ago, that the US plane's invasion of Soviet airspace was an unauthorized flight, was complete nonsense. The US government not only "authorized" this provocative activity, but also authorized such provocative activities on a regular basis. Sending planes to invade Soviet airspace to steal military intelligence is a consistent US policy. Herter also said that if the US government did not take such measures, "it would be abandoning its responsibility not only to the American people, but also to free people everywhere." Is there a more despicable and shameless precedent in the history of world diplomacy than a government openly declaring that it is its national policy to conduct espionage against another country, and even to invade its airspace for such purposes?

　　In order to find a basis for this bandit policy of the United States, Herter fabricated the claim that the United States had to send planes to invade Soviet airspace because the United States was constantly threatened by Soviet "sudden attacks and aggression." This excuse is obviously absurd. Soviet planes have not been flying along the US border, let alone invading US territory, but US planes have been flying along the Soviet border and repeatedly invading Soviet airspace. Who exactly is threatening whose security? The United States is now not only posing an "aggressive threat" to the Soviet Union, but is also directly engaged in blatant acts of aggression. According to Herter's logic, wouldn't the Soviet Union have even more reason and need to send its own planes to conduct "aerial surveillance" over the United States? Moreover, people clearly remember that it was the Soviet Union that proposed the establishment of observation posts to prevent surprise attacks, but the United States flatly refused. The United States is now using the prevention of sudden attacks as an excuse to invade Soviet airspace. How can it justify this? Particularly absurd is that Herter once again criticized the Soviet Union's rejection of the "open skies" proposal, saying that the Soviet Union "closes its society very tightly and controls it very strictly." What he meant was: If you are not willing to let me legally collect military intelligence, then I have no choice but to steal it illegally. In this case, it is not the United States but the Soviet Union that should be blamed for the US plane's invasion of Soviet airspace. What a complete frame-up.

　　In this way, the US Secretary of State has clarified another point: the United States has always been keen to advocate "open skies" for the sole purpose of conducting espionage activities to collect Soviet military intelligence. Moreover, Herter is actually openly declaring that the United States will continue to send planes to invade Soviet airspace. Because everyone knows that the Soviet Union will never open its skies to the agents of the US Central Intelligence Agency to make it easier for the United States to collect intelligence. However, if US planes continue to engage in this kind of "penetrating" espionage activity, they will certainly not escape the fate of being shot down like Powers' plane, and the US government will not escape the guilt of aggression.

　　The US State Department's last two statements were clear enough in exposing the bandit and rogue face of US imperialism, but now the US Secretary of State still feels that it is not enough and makes another "supplement and clarification," which makes the ferocious features of this great villain of US imperialism even more vivid.

    愈描愈黑

    连日以来，华盛顿陷于一片混乱的状态。由于美国飞机侵犯苏联领空引起世界舆论的谴责，白宫的官员弄得手忙脚乱。美国国务院一再发表声明企图掩饰罪行，开脱罪责，但是前后矛盾百出，反而使美国政府处于愈来愈狼狈的窘境。
    美国国务卿赫脱5月9日又亲自发表了一个声明来“补充和澄清”美国国务院5月7日发表的声明中所表明的美国政府的态度。赫脱在他的声明中公开宣称：“据1947年的国家安全法，总统（艾森豪威尔）从他执政的时候开始就把这样的指示付诸实施：用一切可能的手段搜集……所需要的（苏联）情报”，“根据这些指示，已经拟订并且实施了各项计划，其中包括由没有武装的民用飞机进行广泛的空中监视，这种监视在通常情况下在边缘进行，但是有时就穿进去了。”
    这样，美国国务卿就的确澄清了一个问题：他所领导的国务院前两天发表的声明中所谓美国飞机侵犯苏联领空是一次没有授权的飞行的说法，完全是骗人的鬼话，美国政府不仅“授权”进行这次挑衅活动，而且授权经常进行这样的挑衅活动。美国派遣飞机侵犯苏联领空窃取军事情报是美国一贯的政策。赫脱还说，如果美国政府不采取这样的措施，“它就是放弃了不但对美国人民、而且对各地自由人民的责任”。一国的政府公然宣布对别国进行间谍活动，甚至为了这样的目的而侵犯别国的领空是自己的国策，在世界外交史上难道还能找得到比这个更卑鄙无耻的先例吗？
    赫脱为了要给美国的这种强盗政策找寻根据，无中生有地说什么美国所以要派飞机侵犯苏联的领空，是因为美国经常受到苏联“突然袭击和侵略的威胁”。这种借口显然是十分荒谬的。苏联的飞机并没有沿着美国的边境飞行，更没有侵犯过美国的国境，而是美国的飞机经常沿着苏联的边境飞行，并且一再侵犯苏联的领空，究竟是谁威胁着谁的安全呢？美国现在不仅对苏联进行着“侵略的威胁”，而且直接进行了明目张胆的侵略活动。按照赫脱的逻辑，难道不是苏联更有理由和必要派遣自己的飞机到美国的上空去进行“空中监视”吗？而且人们都清楚地记得，正是苏联曾经建议建立防止突然袭击的监督岗，而美国却一口拒绝。美国现在竟以防范突然袭击来作为侵犯苏联领空的借口，怎么能站得住脚呢？特别荒唐的是，赫脱竟再一次非难苏联拒绝“开放天空”的建议，说什么苏联“把自己的社会关闭得很紧，控制得很严”。他的意思是说：你不肯让我合法地收集军事情报，我就只好非法地来窃取。如此说来，发生了美国飞机侵犯苏联领空事件，应该受到责难的不是美国反而是苏联。真是十足的诬赖。
    这样美国国务卿又澄清了另外一个问题：美国过去一直热心主张“开放天空”，目的完全是为了进行搜集苏联军事情报的间谍活动。不仅如此，赫脱实际上是公开宣布：美国仍将继续派遣飞机侵入苏联的领空。因为谁都知道，苏联是绝对不会为了使美国收集情报的活动更方便些，就把自己的天空开放给美国中央情报局的特务人员的。不过，如果美国的飞机继续要进行这种“穿进去”的间谍活动，它们也一定逃脱不了和鲍尔士的飞机一样被打下来的命运，而美国政府也逃脱不了侵略的罪责。
    美国国务院上两次的声明，就已经把美帝国主义那一副强盗兼流氓的嘴脸暴露得够清楚的了，现在美国国务卿还嫌有所未足，再进行一番“补充和澄清”，这就使美帝国主义这个大恶棍的凶相更活现出来了。
