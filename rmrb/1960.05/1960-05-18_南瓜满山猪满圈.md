    Pumpkins Cover the Mountains, Pigs Fill the Pens
    Shí Xiùhuá, First Secretary of the CPC Daoxian County Committee, Hunan

    The sound of hoes rings through the clouds,
    Each strike splits ten thousand mountains.
    Each seed holds a heart,
    Pumpkins cover the mountains, pigs fill the pens.

    The above folk song was sung during the effort to achieve a flying start and ensure the "million pigs" target by opening up wasteland to plant pumpkins. The commune members said: "This is a song of victory, and also a war drum urging us onward."

    Our Daoxian County is a mountainous area, mostly barren hills and ridges. Before liberation, the working people suffered deeply from the oppression of the reactionary ruling class, toiling all year round but unable to get enough to eat. Fertile land lay desolate, and waste land became widespread; no one even thought about opening up the mountains. After liberation, in the short span of ten years, under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the broad masses of working people have written heroic poems with their own hands. Whether from the hilly areas to the cloud-piercing mountains, from the Han people to the Yao people, every corner has undergone profound changes.

    Now the paddy fields have changed; they have gone from one crop to two, three, or four crops a year. The dry land has also changed; with intercropping and continuous cropping, up to five crops a year are possible. Low yields have become high yields, and the entire county is green in all seasons. And what about the mountains! In recent years, they have been constantly dressed in new green clothes. No! This is not enough. They must also change. "The pig is the head of the six domestic animals," more pigs mean more fertilizer and more grain. Thus, a movement to create ten thousand pumpkin mountains has unfolded vigorously. Why are people so interested in pumpkins? Because they have high yields and are widely useful. They are good vegetables for people to eat, and good feed for pigs. They can be used to brew wine, and also to make sugar. The entire pig is a treasure, and the entire pumpkin is also a treasure.

    Although everyone knows how to grow pumpkins, completing the planting of ten thousand mountains is no small task, as it relates to the entire plan of one pig per mu of cultivated land. Therefore, county, commune, and team leading cadres went up the mountains.

    Nanzhuping Brigade of Simaqiao Commune is located in a mountain valley with grotesque rocks on Mengdu Ridge, which soars into the clouds in the Wuling Mountains. The 263 households cover an area of 40 square kilometers. In the effort to open up mountains and plant pumpkins on a large scale, the entire brigade formed a shock force of more than 100 people. Party and League members and activists formed a youth shock brigade, led by Deputy Secretary Lai Xingdi, to launch a decisive battle against Mao Su Chong, a wasteland with potentially tens of thousands of mu to be opened up. The youth shock brigade members, wielding large machetes, led the way. Wherever there were difficulties, they fought there. Guo Lingjiao, a female Communist Youth League member, had her hands pricked and her clothes torn, but she still led the way. After arduous struggle, they finally opened up a narrow path leading to the top of the mountain. More than 100 heroes pitched tents and broke the first ground on this virgin land that had never been cultivated. Just when the commune members' enthusiasm was high, a severe test arrived. On the evening of March 18, the temperature suddenly dropped. In the spring season of southern China, silvery snowflakes suddenly fell from the sky. The newly opened path was submerged in ice and snow, the reeds froze into ice sticks, and the small branches turned into silver bars, bent over by the cold wind. Many people's hands and feet were frostbitten and cracked. Such weather was simply rare in southern Hunan. More than 100 heroes, persisting on the icy mountain, lost contact with the foot of the mountain. The food and vegetables they had brought were all eaten. Cold and hunger would test everyone. Comrade Lai Xingdi, deputy secretary of the Party branch, decided to lead more than ten commune members to break through the ice and snow and go down the mountain to transport grain. The commune members at home, seeing the sudden change in climate and thinking of the more than 100 commune members trapped on the snowy mountain, were extremely anxious and asked to send vegetables and rice up the mountain. In this way, through the joint efforts of the front and rear, they finally overcame the cold ice and snow. After less than a month of hard work, they completed the task of opening up 20,000 mu of mountain land. All of them were planted with corn and pumpkins. Shazihe Brigade of Gongba Commune planned to plant one hundred pumpkin mountains. When more than sixty had been completed, the deputy secretary of the brigade, Zheng Qiyi, was so worried about the lack of seeds that he paced back and forth. When the women's director, Liao Wushu, learned of this, she first donated half a jin of pumpkin seeds that she had saved and intended to give to her children. Under her leadership, the old commune member Jiang Youneng held the pumpkin seeds in both hands and sent them to the brigade office, saying, "I planned to plant these by the house, but I heard that the brigade is having difficulties, so these seeds should be planted by the collective first." The cadres repeatedly tried to persuade him to take them back and plant them himself, but he said angrily, "Does the People's Commune not have a share for an old man like me?" Thanks to the active support of the commune members, the seed problem was quickly resolved. All one hundred pumpkin mountains were sown with seeds of harvest in a timely manner. This is not just a few seeds, but a sincere heart of the people striving forward in the direction pointed out by our great leader. In less than a month, the entire county completed more than 10,000 pumpkin mountains, and achieved simultaneous land preparation, planting, and management.

    Now, on the large and small mountain tops of Daoxian County, pumpkin vines are spreading everywhere. The verdant color is full of infinite vitality, and the abundant fruits also herald a beautiful harvest.

    南瓜满山猪满圈
    中共湖南道县县委第一书记　石秀华
    一阵锄声响云间，声声劈开万座山，一颗种籽一颗心，南瓜满山猪满圈。
    上面这首山歌是在争取开门红，保证养猪“百万头”开荒种南瓜时唱出来的。社员们说：“这是凯歌高奏，又是战鼓催春。”
    我们道县是一个山区，大都是荒山秃岭。解放前，劳动人民深受反动统治阶级的压迫，终年劳苦到头，连一口饱饭都吃不上，良田荒芜、废土成片，哪里还想到去开山。解放后，短短的十年中，在党和毛主席的英明领导下，广大的劳动人民用自己的双手，写下了英雄的诗篇；不论是从丘陵区到高入云端的山麓、从汉族到瑶族，每一个角落都起了深刻的变化。
    现在水田变了；由一季变成了二熟、三熟、四熟。旱土也变了；间作连作多的一年可达五熟。低产变了高产，全县是四季皆青。还有山呢！几年来，它正不断地穿上了绿油油的新装。不！这还不够。还得要它变。“猪为六畜之首”，猪多肥多粮更多。于是一个万座南瓜山的运动就蓬蓬勃勃地展开了。人们对南瓜为什么这样感兴趣呢？因为他产量高，用处广，人吃是好菜，喂猪是好粮。既可煮酒，又可制糖。猪全身是宝，南瓜全身也是宝。
    南瓜虽然是人人会种，但要完成万座山的播种就不是一件小事，这关系到每亩耕地一头猪的整个计划。于是县、社、队领导干部上山了。
    四马桥公社南竹坪大队是住在五岭山脉高耸云霄的萌都岭上的怪石横生的山窝里。二百六十三户人家，面积横直却有四十平方公里，在开山大种南瓜中，全队组成一百余名突击手。党、团员积极分子组成了青年突击队，由副支书赖兴弟带领，向有可开几万亩的荒山——毛粟冲展开了决战。青年突击队员们，手拿大柴刀在前开路，那里有困难，他们就战斗到那里。女共青团员郭龄姣手刺破了，衣服撕破了，仍然领头开路。经过艰苦奋斗，终于开出了一条通向山顶的羊肠小道。百余名英雄搭上了帐篷，在这块从未被开垦过的处女地上挖下了第一锄头。正当社员们热情高涨的时候，严重的考验到来了。3月18日的晚上气温突然下降，时值祖国南方的春季，天空却突然飘起了银闪闪的雪花。新开出的小道，被冰雪淹没了，芦苇结成了冰棍，小树枝变成了白银条，被寒风吹得叮叮当当的弯下了腰，许多人的手脚被冻红肿，开裂，这样的天气在祖国的湖南的南部简直是少见的。坚持在冰山雪岭上的一百余名英雄们，和山下断绝了联系，带去的粮食蔬菜全都吃完了，寒冷与饥饿将考验着每一个人，党支部副书记赖兴弟同志决定带领十多个社员冒着冰雪突围下山赶运粮食。在家的社员，看见气候突变，想到百余名社员陷在大雪山未归，更是焦急万分，纷纷要求送菜送米上山。就这样在前后方的共同努力下，终于战胜了寒冷的冰雪，经过不到一个月的奋战，共完成了二万亩开山任务。全都种上了玉米和南瓜。公坝公社沙子河大队计划种一百个南瓜山，当完成六十多个的时候，因缺乏种籽，大队副支书郑启易急得打转转。这件事让妇女主任廖五姝知道了，她首先将自己收存好准备给孩子们吃的半斤南瓜子献了出来。在她的带动下，老社员蒋友能双手捧着南瓜子送到大队办公室说，“这是我打算种在屋边的，听说大队有困难，这点瓜子应先让集体种。”干部们再三劝说叫他自己拿回去种，他反而发气的说：“难道人民公社就没有我这个老头子一份吗？”由于社员的积极支持，种籽问题很快地解决了。全队一百个南瓜山及时地播下了丰收种。这不仅仅是几颗种籽，而是人们向着我们伟大领袖所指引的方向奋勇前进的一颗赤诚的心，全县在不到一个月的时间里，完成了一万多个南瓜山，并做到了边整地边种边管理。
    现在，在道县的大小山头，到处都蔓延着南瓜的藤叶，青翠的颜色，充满了无限生机，累累的果实也预示了丰收的美景。
