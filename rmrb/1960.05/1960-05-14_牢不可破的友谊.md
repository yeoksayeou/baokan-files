Premier Zhou Enlai has been in Hanoi for three days. In these days, this beautiful city along the Red River is filled with deep friendship between China and Vietnam. Whenever Premier Zhou's car passes through the streets, the roadsides are always crowded with people. The surging sea of flags, the exciting cheers, and the enthusiastic smiles are truly moving.

Today, when Premier Zhou went from the Presidential Palace to visit the Polytechnic University and the Renzheng Township Agricultural Cooperative, the grand occasion of being welcomed on both sides of the road, similar to when Premier Zhou arrived in Hanoi, reappeared on such a long road. All the way, tens of thousands of Hanoi citizens almost used applause and cheers to send the distinguished Chinese guests to the Polytechnic University and the Renzheng Township Agricultural Cooperative. The facts repeatedly demonstrate that our friendship is eternal and unbreakable. This cannot help but make people think how foolish those Western imperialists are who attempt to undermine the unity of socialist countries!

Premier Zhou, accompanied by Prime Minister Pham Van Dong, arrived at the beautiful campus of the Polytechnic University. It is truly a garden full of spring colors and youthful joy. In the welcoming ranks were not only the teachers and students of the Polytechnic University but also the teachers and students of the General University, the Normal University, the Medical University, the University of Finance and Economics, the Agricultural and Forestry College, and the Academy of Fine Arts. As soon as they saw Premier Zhou, they jumped and shouted in Chinese and Vietnamese: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live President Ho!" "Long live the Chinese Communist Party! Long live the Vietnam Workers' Party! Long live Sino-Vietnamese friendship!"

When Premier Zhou entered the exhibition room of the Polytechnic University to visit, all the guides spoke to Premier Zhou in fluent Chinese, addressing him as "Dear Premier Zhou" like Chinese college students. They pointed to the exhibits and said, "This is a model of the dormitory we built with our own hands, combining education with labor." "We go to participate in labor every year, and this is a factory blueprint we designed during labor." "This is the semiconductor we researched, and those are the textbooks and lecture notes we compiled ourselves." Premier Zhou watched attentively and praised repeatedly, "Good! You have achieved great results!" When he saw the sports charts, Premier Zhou asked a student, "Which sport are you best at?" The student replied, "We like football the most." Premier Zhou smiled and said to the principal, "Welcome to send a football team to China for a friendly match with Chinese university students."

After leaving the exhibition room, Premier Zhou and Prime Minister Pham Van Dong attended a welcoming meeting held by the teachers and students of these seven universities. Above the venue, a huge red lantern was hung, and the colorful paper strips on the lantern extended to the surroundings of the venue, like thousands of radiating rays. Xie Guangbao, the president of the Polytechnic University, expressed the Vietnamese youth's feelings for the Chinese people in his speech. He said, "In our Polytechnic University, 58% of the teachers graduated from major universities and colleges in China. These comrades have received correct training in both technical learning and ideological training during their studies in China. Now they are actively participating in the construction of our school, enthusiastically teaching the knowledge they have learned to the young students who are growing up in the new society with a socialist attitude." He repeatedly asked Premier Zhou to convey their friendly greetings to the teachers and students of Chinese universities.

When Premier Zhou Enlai spoke, every sentence of his speech aroused applause and cheers. Especially when Premier Zhou proposed that the universities of the two countries should conduct friendly competition to train more proletarian intellectuals who are both red and expert for each other, thunderous applause broke out in the hall, expressing enthusiastic response. What was most touching was the scene of Premier Zhou cheering for Sino-Vietnamese friendship. At that time, thousands of teachers and students shouted "Long live, long live, long live!" in Chinese for a while, and shouted "Mo Nan, Mo Nan, Mo Nan! (Long live)" in Vietnamese for a while.

Just as the teachers and students of these seven universities were using "Long live" and "Mo Nan" to wish Sino-Vietnamese friendship would last forever, the members of the Renzheng Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Hanoi had already gathered on the streets, waiting for the visit of the distinguished Chinese guests. Suddenly, the sound of car horns came. As the car doors opened, Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Pham Van Dong stepped out with smiles. Immediately, cheers, applause, and the sound of musical instruments blended into one, and the quiet countryside immediately became a boiling, joyful ocean.

The peasant brothers of Renzheng Township welcomed Premier Zhou with the most solemn and profound etiquette. Wherever Premier Zhou went, elaborately dressed folk artists danced traditional welcoming dances to lead the way. The elders in the village, some wearing red robes symbolizing auspiciousness, expressed their sincere respect for the guests.

Amidst crisp cheers, Premier Zhou Enlai visited Renzheng Township Elementary School. When the children saw Premier Zhou, they jumped up to greet him and Ambassador He Wei, like seeing their dearest person, and put red scarves on them. Premier Zhou sat with the children with great interest, listening attentively to the teacher's lecture. The text of the day was "President Ho Loves Children," which described the scene of President Ho visiting the Beihai Kindergarten in Beijing a few years ago and being warmly welcomed by the children. Premier Zhou asked a child next to him, "Do you know Beijing?" The child stood up and replied affectionately, "Beijing is the capital of China!" Prime Minister Pham Van Dong asked another child, "What did President Ho do in Beijing?" The child replied, "Go to visit the Beihai Nursery!" This innocent answer caused a burst of hearty laughter from the two prime ministers. As Premier Zhou was about to leave the elementary school, the children happily sang "The East is Red" and "Ode to Ho Chi Minh," and Premier Zhou clapped his hands along with the rhythm of the songs, singing with the children.

Premier Zhou Enlai was invited to visit the homes of cooperative members. Whether it was the elderly or the young female cooperative members, they all expressed their deep feelings to their beloved Chinese guests. When Premier Zhou visited the home of Nguyen Thi Tuyen, the female deputy director of the township agricultural cooperative who lost her husband in the Anti-French War, she picked unripe mangoes from the tree and gave them to Premier Zhou. She said, "This fruit is not yet ripe, but this is my heart."

Exciting things are endless. At the mass rally to welcome Premier Zhou Enlai, when Premier Zhou wished their cooperative to be bigger and develop faster, bursts of applause rang out in the hall. Du Dengping, Chairman of the Township Administrative Committee, presented gifts to the Chinese guests on behalf of all the farmers in the township. Among the gifts that filled a table, there was a copper-made, exquisitely crafted water pipe given by an old man named Nguyen Dinh Shen. The old man held Premier Zhou's hand tightly and said, "In the past, under the rule of French imperialism, we lived a painful life. Only with the Labor Party did we get enough to eat and wear. Now we are engaged in construction, and we are getting great help from you, which makes us not know how to thank you enough. This water pipe was passed down from my grandfather, and I give it to you to express my heart." When the old man said this, his deep-set eyes seemed so affectionate and meaningful. Another gift was two peace doves in a bamboo cage. Du Dengping, Chairman of the Township Administrative Committee, said to Premier Zhou, "This pair of peace doves commemorates the efforts made by Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Pham Van Dong six years ago at the Geneva Conference to work together to strive for peace in Indochina. It also demonstrates the firm will of the people of China and Vietnam to defend peace side by side."

When Premier Zhou left Renzheng Township, the villagers reluctantly bid farewell, and they couldn't help but sing the Chinese song "Unity is Strength." Unity, unity! The sincere and warm welcome of the Vietnamese government and the Vietnamese people to Premier Zhou once again demonstrated the unbreakable, brotherly friendship between Vietnam and China. Our two peoples will always unite in the big family of the socialist camp and strive for the construction of our motherland, against imperialism, and for the defense of peace.

    牢不可破的友谊 
    新华社记者　于民生　胡本英
    周恩来总理到达河内已经三天了。这几天来，这个红河沿岸的美丽的城市到处洋溢着中越两国的深厚友情。每当周总理乘坐汽车路过街道的时候，道路两旁总是挤满了人。那波浪起伏的旗海，那激动人心的欢呼，那热情的笑脸，实在令人感动。
    今天，当周总理从主席府去百科大学和仁政乡农业社访问的时候，在那么长的道路上，又出现了周总理到达河内时受到夹道欢迎的盛况，一路上成千上万的河内市民几乎是用掌声和欢呼声把中国贵宾送到百科大学和仁政乡农业社。事实一再说明我们的友谊是永恒的，牢不可破的。这不禁使人想起，那些企图破坏社会主义国家团结的西方帝国主义者是多么愚蠢！
    周总理由范文同总理陪同来到百科大学美丽的校园。这里真是满园春色，一片青春的欢乐。在欢迎的行列里不仅有百科大学的师生，而且还有综合大学、师范大学、医科大学、财经大学、农林学院和美术学院的师生。他们一见到周总理就跳跃着用中国话和越南话高呼：“毛主席万岁！胡主席万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！越南劳动党万岁！中越友谊万岁！”
    当周总理走进百科大学展览室去参观的时候，所有的讲解员都用流利的中国话向周总理作介绍，就像中国大学生那样称“亲爱的周总理”，他们指着那一件件陈列品说：“这是我们把教育同劳动相结合，用自己的双手建设的宿舍模型。”“我们每年去参加劳动，这是我们在劳动中设计的工厂图纸。”“这是我们研究的半导体，那是我们自己编写的教材和讲义。”周总理一面聚精会神地看，一面赞不绝口：“好啊！你们很有成绩！”在看到体育图表的时候，周总理问一位学生：“你们那一种体育运动最好？”这个学生回答：“我们最喜欢足球。”周总理笑着对校长说：“欢迎你们派一个足球队到中国访问，同中国大学生作友谊比赛。”
    走出展览室以后，周总理和范文同总理一起出席了这七所大学的师生们举行的欢迎大会。会场的上空，悬挂着一个巨大的红灯，红灯上的多彩的纸条伸延到会场四周，有如万道辐射的霞光。百科大学校长谢光宝在讲话中，深深地表达了越南青年对中国人民的感情。他说，“在我们的百科大学里，58％的教师是在中国各大专学校毕业的。这些同志在留华学习期间，不管在技术学习方面或是思想锻炼方面都已经得到正确的培养。现在他们正在积极地参加本校的建设，以社会主义的态度热心地把学到的知识教给在新社会成长起来的青年学生们”。他一再请周总理把他们友谊的问候转达给中国各大学的师生们。
    当周恩来总理讲话的时候，他的每一段话都激起了掌声和欢呼声。特别是在周总理提议两国大学教育为各自培养更多的又红又专的无产阶级知识分子而进行友谊竞赛的时候，全场发出了春雷般的掌声表示热烈响应。最感动人的是周总理为中越友谊欢呼的场面。那时候数千名师生一会儿用中国话连喊“万岁，万岁，万万岁！”一会儿用越南话喊“莫南，莫南，莫南！（万岁）”
    就在这七所大学的师生们用“万岁”和“莫南”祝中越友谊万古长青的时候，河内市郊仁政乡农业生产合作社的社员们早已聚集在街头等候着中国贵宾的来访。突然传来了汽车的喇叭声。车门开处，周恩来总理和范文同总理笑着走出汽车。顿时，欢呼声、掌声和乐器声响成一片，静谧的乡村立即成了沸腾的、欢乐的海洋。
    仁政乡的农民兄弟以最隆重、最深厚的礼节来欢迎周总理。无论周总理走到那里，都有盛装的民间艺人跳着传统的迎宾舞在前引路。乡里的耆老，有的身穿像征吉祥的红色长袍，表示对客人的诚挚的敬意。
    在一片清脆的欢呼声中，周恩来总理来到仁政乡小学参观。孩子们见了周总理像见了自己最亲爱的人一样，跳跃着迎上来给周总理和何伟大使带上红领巾。周总理兴致勃勃地同孩子们坐在一起，凝神静听教师的讲课。这天的课文是“胡主席爱儿童”，课文写的是胡主席几年前访问中国在北京参观北海幼儿园时受到孩子热烈欢迎的情形。周总理问他身旁的一个孩子：“你知道北京吗？”孩子站起来亲切地回答说：“北京是中国的首都！”范文同总理问另一个孩子：“胡主席到北京作什么？”孩子回答：“去参观北海托儿所！”这天真的回答，引起了两国总理一阵爽朗的笑声。在周总理要离开这所小学的时候，孩子们愉快地唱起“东方红”和“胡志明颂”，周恩来总理也随着歌曲的节奏，拍着手同孩子一起歌唱。
    周恩来总理被邀请到社员家里作客，无论是年迈的老人，还是年青的女社员，都向他们亲爱的中国客人表示了深厚的心意。周总理在访问乡农业合作社副社长阮氏荃的家时，这位在抗法战争中牺牲了丈夫的女社长，把树上还未成熟的芒果摘下送给周总理。她说：“这果子还未熟，但这是我的心意”。
    激动人心的事情是叙述不完的。在欢迎周恩来总理的全乡群众大会上，当周总理祝他们的合作社办得更大、发展更快的时候，全场响起了一阵又一阵的掌声。乡行政委员会主席杜登平代表全乡农民向中国客人赠送了礼品。在堆满了一桌子的礼物中，有一位叫阮庭申的老大爷送的铜质精制水烟袋。老大爷紧握着周总理的手说：“过去我们在法帝国主义统治下，过着痛苦的生活。有了劳动党，我们才得到温饱。现在我们正在进行建设，又得到你们的大力帮助，使我们真不知怎样感谢才好。这个水烟袋是我祖父传下来的，送给您来表我的心。”当老人说这话的时候，他那深陷的双眼，显得是那样情深谊长。还有一件礼品是用竹笼装着的两只和平鸽。乡行政委员会主席杜登平对周总理说：“这一对和平鸽是纪念周恩来总理同范文同总理六年前在日内瓦会议上携手为争取印度支那和平所作出的努力。同时也表明中越两国人民并肩保卫和平的坚强意志。”
    在周总理离开仁政乡的时候，乡亲们依依不舍地送别，他们情不自禁地唱起了“团结就是力量”这首中国歌曲。团结，团结！越南政府和越南人民对周总理的真诚而热烈的欢迎，又一次显示了越中两国牢不可破的、兄弟般的友谊，我们两国人民将永远团结在社会主义阵营的大家庭里，为建设祖国、反对帝国主义、保卫和平而奋斗。
