Xinhua News Agency, 27th Dispatch: The Ministry of Communications recently decided to universally promote four technological innovation and revolution experiences in over two thousand large and small ports across the country. These four experiences are: the experience of Guangxi Wuzhou Port in organizing cooperation among various departments to quickly realize mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading and unloading; the experience of Guangzhou Port's Fangcun Operation Area in achieving mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading and unloading through self-reliance; the experience of Qingdao Port and Shanghai Port in rapid loading and unloading; and the experience of Shanghai Port and Zhanjiang Port in advancing from mechanization and semi-mechanization to automation and semi-automation. The Ministry of Communications requires all major ports across the country to basically achieve mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading and unloading within this year, doubling loading and unloading efficiency and halving loading and unloading personnel.

	The main experience of Guangxi Wuzhou Port is: overall planning, assigning areas of responsibility, mobilizing all enterprises and departments to contribute their efforts and resources, help each other, and work together. In the process of realizing mechanization and semi-mechanization, the professional transportation department concentrates its efforts on overcoming the weak links in loading and unloading work such as lifting from warehouses, feeding materials, and stacking, trial-producing various machines, and connecting and comprehensively utilizing various machines; various factories and enterprises focus on solving the mechanical operation problems of climbing, entering warehouses, and stacking, according to their different cargo characteristics. After such division of labor and cooperation, within a month, the wharves and factory transportation and loading and unloading had machines, and companies and shops had vehicles. The port's loading and unloading efficiency was increased by 3.8 times compared with manual operation, labor was saved by half, and the average berthing time of ships was reduced from 2.2 days in the past to 0.97 days.

	The main characteristic of Guangzhou Port's Fangcun Operation Area is: self-reliance and arming oneself. This operation area was established in 1958. At that time, there were no technicians or skilled workers, and loading and unloading relied entirely on manual labor. The operation area could not even manufacture a single screw. After the Party put forward the call to march towards mechanization and semi-mechanization, the workers built indigenous equipment and machine tools, visiting, learning, and manufacturing at the same time. Without materials, they mobilized everyone to "find, contribute, and substitute (supplies)." Now, they have manufactured more than 300 vehicles of various types and 28 motors, and renovated the roads on the wharf, increasing the loading and unloading efficiency of various materials by half to four times.

	The experience of Qingdao Port and Shanghai Port is: selecting and matching various loading and unloading machines to form a series of loading and unloading lines to improve loading and unloading efficiency; organizing multi-line loading and unloading operations to greatly shorten loading and unloading time.

	The Second Operation Area of Shanghai Port has realized remote control of belt conveyors; the operators of gantry cranes in Zhanjiang Port no longer drive and operate on the loading and unloading machines, but use remote control devices to direct operations at the hatchways of ships.

	These four experiences were summarized by the Ministry of Communications at the National Port Planning Conference recently held in Guangzhou. The vigorous technological innovation and revolution movement is rapidly changing the backward state of loading and unloading work in most ports across the country, liberating a large number of workers from heavy physical labor, and significantly improving loading and unloading efficiency. For example, the ports in Hunan Province originally planned to increase 50,000 loading and unloading workers this year. Due to vigorous technological innovation, not only is it unnecessary to increase workers now, but a portion of the loading and unloading workers has been drawn out to support other production departments. Among them, Xiangtan City Port alone has transferred more than 1,000 people to participate in urban transportation and technical training after realizing mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading and unloading.

### 推广四大经验提高港口装卸效率  交通部要求全国主要港口今年内做到装卸效率翻番装卸人员减半

    推广四大经验提高港口装卸效率
    交通部要求全国主要港口今年内做到装卸效率翻番装卸人员减半
    据新华社27日讯　交通部最近决定在全国两千多个大小港口中，普遍推广四项技术革新和技术革命经验。这四项经验是：广西梧州港组织各部门协作，快速实现装卸机械化、半机械化的经验；广州港芳村作业区白手起家实现装卸机械化、半机械化的经验；青岛港、上海港快速装卸的经验；上海港、湛江港由机械化、半机械化向自动化、半自动化方向迈进的经验。交通部要求全国各主要港口在今年内基本上实现装卸机械化、半机械化，做到装卸效率提高一倍，装卸人员节约一半。
    广西梧州港的主要经验是：全面规划，分片包干，把各个企业、各个部门动员起来，有力出力，有料出料，互助协作，一齐动手。在实现机械化、半机械化的过程中，专业运输部门集中力量克服起仓、喂料、码垛等装卸工作中的薄弱环节，试制各种机具，并把各种机具衔接起来，综合利用；各厂矿企业则根据各自不同的货物特点，着重解决爬坡、进仓、码垛等工序的机械操作问题。经过这样的分工合作，在一个月内就做到了码头、工厂运输、装卸有机具，公司、商店有车子，港口装卸效率比人工操作时提高了三点八倍，劳动力节省了一半，船舶平均停港时间由过去的二点二一天减少到零点九七天。
    广州港芳村作业区的主要特点是：白手起家，自己武装自己。这个作业区是1958年才成立的，当时没有一个技术人员和技术工人，装卸全靠肩挑背驮，作业区连一颗螺丝钉都不能制造。党提出向机械化、半机械化进军的号召后，职工们大造土设备、土机床，边参观、边学习、边制造，没有材料，就发动大家“找、献、代（用品）”，现在已经制成了各类车辆三百多部、马达二十八部，并改造了码头上的道路，使各种物资的装卸效率提高了半倍到四倍。
    青岛港和上海港的经验是：将多种装卸机械选型配套，组成系列的装卸线，提高装卸效率；组织多线装卸作业，大大缩短装卸时间。
    上海港第二作业区实现了对皮带运输机的遥控；湛江港的门式起重机的操作员，已经不在装卸机上驾驶操纵，而是利用遥控装置在船舶舱口边进行指挥。
    这四项经验，是交通部最近在广州召开的全国港口规划会议上总结的。轰轰烈烈的技术革新和技术革命运动，正在迅速改变着全国大多数港口装卸工作的落后状况，把大批工人从笨重的体力劳动中解放出来，装卸效率有了显著提高。如湖南省各港口，原来计划在今年增加五万名装卸搬运工人，由于大搞技术革新，现在不但不需要增加工人，而且抽出了一部分装卸工人支援其他生产部门，其中仅湘潭市港口实现装卸机械化、半机械化以后，就已经抽出一千多人参加市内搬运和进行技术培训。
