News in Brief

Hunan Achieves Great Victory in Early Rice Transplanting
After a tense struggle with nature, Hunan Province has achieved a decisive victory in early rice transplanting. As of the 5th of this month, the province has transplanted more than 20 million mu of early rice, meeting the requirements of ensuring acreage, ensuring quality, and ensuring the season. Currently, except for a few areas that are finishing up, the vast majority of the province is advancing victoriously, rapidly launching a high tide of transplanting mid-season rice and field management of early rice.

Anhui Begins Sowing and Raising Seedlings for Mid-Season Rice
After the end of early rice sowing, Anhui Province has also comprehensively started sowing and raising seedlings for mid-season rice. The province has soaked more than 200 million jin of mid-season rice seeds and cultivated more than 240,000 mu of seedlings. In order to effectively carry out the work of raising mid-season rice seedlings, people's communes have universally established a "one-package-to-the-end" responsibility system that includes contracting for sowing, ensuring quality, ensuring time, ensuring work points, and ensuring management, to ensure that mid-season rice sowing is both fast and good.

Ningxia Carries Out Pest and Disease Prevention Activities
The Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region is actively carrying out various activities to prevent and control crop diseases and insect pests, strengthening the forecasting and forecasting of diseases and insect pests, and training technical personnel to ensure a bumper harvest. As early as the end of March, twelve counties and cities in the Yellow River Irrigation Area treated 95% of the straw and removed more than 600,000 mu of weeds, eliminating the diseases and insect pests overwintering in these straws and weeds. In conjunction with spring sowing, people's communes used 666 powder to control underground pests on an area of more than 300,000 mu. Seed disinfection was also carried out during sowing.

Sui County Concentrates Efforts to Ramp Up Production of Agricultural Tools
Sui County, Hubei Province, is concentrating manpower and material resources to set up temporary factories on a large scale and step up the production of various agricultural tools urgently needed at present. Since the spring, Sui County has concentrated more than 1,100 iron and woodworkers from commune agricultural tool factories, management district repair stations, and production team repair groups. Taking the commune as a unit, they have concentrated in the county seat to produce a large number of rice transplanters; in Hongshan and other two communes rich in timber, they have concentrated more than 2,900 people to step up the production of wooden carts.

This method of concentrating efforts to ramp up the production of agricultural tools has not only accelerated the production progress and saved raw materials, but also greatly reduced the cost because it uses local materials.

Foliar Spraying of Soil Potassium Nitrate Can Prevent Wheat Lodging
The peasant masses of Hancheng Branch of Weibin Commune in Weiyang District, Xi'an City, have recently widely promoted a method of foliar spraying of soil potassium nitrate to prevent wheat lodging, which has achieved remarkable results.

The biggest feature of foliar spraying of soil potassium nitrate is that it can make wheat stalks strong, and it is faster than applying plant ash to prevent lodging. Wheat that has been sprayed with soil potassium nitrate is generally dark green in color and has relatively thick and hard stalks.

The use of soil potassium nitrate to prevent wheat lodging was successfully tested by Zhang Yimin, a teacher at Ganyesi Elementary School in the suburbs of Xi'an, under the guidance of the Party's policy of combining education and productive labor.

    湖南早稻插秧大获胜利
    经过和大自然紧张的搏斗，湖南省早稻插秧取得了决定性的胜利，到本月5日，全省已插早稻二千多万亩，达到了保面积、保质量、保季节的要求。目前除少数地区正在扫尾以外，全省绝大多数地区正乘胜前进，迅速掀起插中稻和早稻田间管理的高潮。
    安徽开始中稻下种育秧
    安徽省在早稻播种结束后，又全面开始了中稻下种育秧。全省已泡中稻种二亿多斤，培育秧苗二十四万多亩。为了切实作好中稻育秧工作，各人民公社普遍建立了包下种、包质量、包时间、包工分、包管理的一包到底的责任制，保证中稻播种又快又好。
    宁夏开展防治病虫害活动
    宁夏回族自治区积极开展各种防治农作物病虫害的活动，加强病虫害的预测预报，培训技术人员，确保农业丰收。黄河灌区十二个县、市早在3月底，各地就处理了95％的秸秆，铲除杂草六十多万亩，消灭了在这些秸秆、杂草中越冬的病虫害。各人民公社结合春播用六六六粉防治地下害虫面积达三十多万亩。播种时又进行了种子消毒工作。
    随县集中力量突击生产农具
    湖北省随县集中人力物力，大办临时工厂，突击生产当前急需的各种农具。春季以来，随县集中了公社农具厂、管理区修配站和生产队修配组的铁木工人一千一百多人，以公社为单位，集中在县城生产了大批插秧机；在盛产木材的洪山等两个公社，集中了二千九百多人突击生产木板车。
    这种集中力量突击生产农具的办法，既加快了生产进度，节约了原材料，还因为就地取材，大大降低了造价。
    小麦根外喷洒土硝酸钾能防倒伏
    西安市未央区渭滨公社汉城分社的农民群众，最近广泛推广一种给小麦根外喷洒土硝酸钾的办法，防止小麦倒伏，收到显著效果。
    给小麦根外喷洒土硝酸钾，它的最大特点是能使小麦茎强秆壮，比施草木灰防倒伏收效快。凡是喷洒过土硝酸钾的小麦，一般颜色深绿，麦秆比较粗硬。
    利用土硝酸钾防止小麦倒伏是西安市郊感业寺小学教员张仪民，在党的教育和生产劳动相结合的方针下试验成功的。
