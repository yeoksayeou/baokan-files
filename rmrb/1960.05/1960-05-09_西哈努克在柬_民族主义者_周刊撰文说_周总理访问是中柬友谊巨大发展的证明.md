Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, 8th May: The Cambodian "Nationalist" weekly published an editorial written by Prince Sihanouk on the 7th. The editorial stated: "The visit of His Excellency Zhou Enlai to Cambodia allows our people to express their joy and excitement, as they consider this visit the best proof of a welcome and tremendous development in the friendship between our two countries."

The editorial said: "The Khmer people express their deep gratitude to the Chinese government and people, because the Chinese government and people have shown the world that New China attaches the same importance to a small country like Cambodia as it does to a large country. We are also very pleased that Mr. Zhou Enlai's re-visit to our country will have a positive impact on our future, while some neighboring countries hope to see our demise."

Sihanouk refuted the accusations by some Westerners that Cambodia "has not maintained balance between East and West." He put forward two arguments: First, Cambodia has invited several heads of state and leaders of the "free world," including Eisenhower, Sarit Thanarat, Ngo Dinh Diem, and Garcia. He said, "These politicians have not yet come to visit Cambodia. Is this the fault of our neutral policy? Is this Mr. Zhou Enlai's fault? He has merely once again demonstrated his diplomatic brilliance."

Second, Cambodia has neither the time nor the means to express hostility towards People's China on the issues of the Tibetan affairs and the Sino-Indian border dispute, because "Cambodia faces serious threats from South Vietnam and Thailand, both of which are allies of the free world." He stated, "We love India as a great sister country to Cambodia, but if India has no way to help our country overcome the threats from Thailand and South Vietnam, then what can Cambodia, which is far weaker than India and has only one-seventieth of India's population, do to help India overcome its difficulties?"

The editorial said, "People's China has never threatened Cambodia. On the contrary, whenever we are threatened, for example, when South Vietnam invaded our Stung Treng province, it has always supported us solemnly and firmly.

"The Khmer people are convinced that, because of the attitude taken by People's China towards us, and especially because of the support of Premier Zhou Enlai and Marshal Chen Yi, Cambodia still exists and is able to avoid the assassinations planned by some of its neighbors. However, people in the free world are asking Cambodia to smile at those who are trying to destroy it and to attack China. This makes no sense."

Sihanouk said that the policies of some neighboring countries are at odds with the times, and he urged "all friends in the free world not to forget the recent lessons of the developments in Cuba, South Korea, and Turkey, as well as the developments brewing in other places, in countries ruled by Ngo Dinh Diem, Trujillo, and other gentlemen."

Sihanouk said: "It is undeniable that threats and contempt for neutral countries are driving them increasingly away from the free world. The walls erected by the free world have already collapsed in several places, and the communists... have not fired a single shot."

Sihanouk further said: "Furthermore, we cannot yet believe that the Americans and the free world have understood where their major interests lie and clearly identified which path they will take—good or bad. But even if they find the right path, one can still doubt whether they will have sufficient means and willingness to change their policies. In fact, it must be admitted that even if these friends are beginning to revise their policies towards some of their allies, it is already too late."

In the editorial, Sihanouk also refuted the remarks made by the Lao Minister of National Defense, Phoumi Nosavan, in response to questions from a "Vientiane World" reporter. Sihanouk wrote: "To insist that Cambodia's neutral policy is not a genuine neutral policy is a hypocritical statement. But if people say that Cambodia's neutral policy and Laos' neutral policy are different, then we completely agree on this point. In fact, if Cambodia's neutrality obliges us to treat the countries of both blocs as friends and treat them equally, then, according to the statements of Lao politicians, it can be seen that Laos' neutrality is pro-free world, while refusing to have any relations with countries of the communist bloc."

Sihanouk wrote: "'Vientiane World', like 'Vietnam Times', is a newspaper subsidized by foreign imperialism, and these newspapers use the language of foreign imperialists, which the Lao people and the Vietnamese people rarely understand. In fact, the purpose of these English-language newspapers is nothing more than to split the peoples of the three former Indochinese countries, to destroy the ideal of neutrality in the minds of the Khmer, Vietnamese, and Lao peoples, to distance them from Panchsheel and to involve them in the activities of the imperialists—the two poles of which are Saigon and Bangkok—and to oppose the Bandung principles, thereby opposing the ideals of peace and independence itself."

### 西哈努克在柬“民族主义者”周刊撰文说  周总理访问是中柬友谊巨大发展的证明

    西哈努克在柬“民族主义者”周刊撰文说
    周总理访问是中柬友谊巨大发展的证明
    据新华社金边8日电　柬埔寨“民族主义者”周刊7日发表了西哈努克亲王写的一篇社论。社论写道：“周恩来阁下对柬埔寨的访问，使得我国人民能够表达他们的欢欣鼓舞之情，因为他们认为这次访问是两国之间的友谊的可喜的巨大发展的最好证明。”
    社论说：“高棉人民对中国政府和人民表示深切的感激，因为中国政府和人民向全世界表明，新中国对柬埔寨这样的小国像它对大国同样的重视。同样使我们感到非常满意的是，周恩来先生的再一次访问我国将对我国前途产生良好的影响，而某些邻国却希望看到我们的消灭。”
    西哈努克反驳某些西方人士所说的柬埔寨“没有在东西方之间保持均衡”的指责。他提出了两个论点：一、柬埔寨邀请了“自由世界”的好几位国家元首和领导人，其中有艾森豪威尔、乃沙立、阮玉书和加西亚。他说，“这些政治家还没有前来访问柬埔寨，难道这是我们的中立政策的过错吗？难道这是周恩来先生的过错吗？他只不过再一次表明了他在外交上的英明。”
    二、柬埔寨既没有功夫也没有手段来在有关西藏事件和中印边界争端问题上，表示对人民中国的敌视态度，因为“柬埔寨面临着来自南越和泰国的严重威胁，而这两个国家是自由世界的盟国”。他表示，“我们热爱作为柬埔寨的伟大姊妹国家的印度，但是，如果印度没有办法来帮助我国克服来自泰国和南越的威胁，那么，远比印度弱小，而且人口仅及印度七十分之一的柬埔寨，能有什么办法来帮助印度克服它的困难呢？”
    社论说，“人民中国从来没有威胁过柬埔寨。恰恰相反，每逢我们遭到威胁的时候，例如，当南越侵入我们的上丁省的时候，它总是庄严而坚定地支持我们。
    “高棉人民深信，由于人民中国对我们采取的态度，特别是由于周恩来总理和陈毅元帅对我们的支持，柬埔寨还存在着，而且能够免受它的一些邻国所策划的暗害。然而，自由世界的人士却要求柬埔寨向企图毁灭它的人们微笑，并要求柬埔寨攻击中国。这是没有道理的。”
    西哈努克说，一些邻国的政策是同时代背道而驰的，他要求“自由世界的所有的朋友们不要忘记古巴、南朝鲜和土耳其的事态发展的最近的教训，以及在其他地方，在吴庭艳、特鲁希略和其他先生们统治的国家中，正在酝酿着的事态发展的教训。”
    西哈努克说：“无可否认的是，对中立国家的威胁和蔑视，驱使它们日益离开自由世界。自由世界所树立的墙壁已经在好几个地方垮下来了，而共产党人……并没有发射一炮。”
    西哈努克又说：“此外，我们还不能够相信美国人和自由世界已经懂得了他们的重大利益的所在并明确识别他们将走上怎样的道路——好的或者坏的道路。但是，即使他们找到了正确的道路，人们还是可以怀疑他们是否将拥有充分的手段和意愿来改变他们的政策。事实上应该承认，即使这些朋友正在着手修改他们对待自己的某些盟国的政策，也已经太晚了一些。
    在社论中，西哈努克还驳斥了老挝国防大臣富米·诺萨万答“万象世界”记者问时发表的谈话。西哈努克写道：“硬说柬埔寨的中立政策不是名副其实的中立政策，这是虚伪的说法。但是如果人们说高棉的中立政策和老挝的中立政策有所不同，那么在这一点上我们完全同意。事实上，如果柬埔寨的中立使我们有义务把两个集团的国家作为朋友并平等对待，那么，根据老挝的政治家们的言论可以看出，老挝的中立是要亲自由世界的，同时拒绝同共产党集团各国发生任何关系”。
    西哈努克写道：“‘万象世界’像‘越南时报’一样，是外国帝国主义出资津贴的报纸，这些报纸用的是外国帝国主义者的语言，老挝人民和越南人民很少懂得这种语言。事实上，这些英语报刊的目的无非是要分裂前印度支那的三国人民，在高棉、越南和老挝人民心目中毁灭中立的理想，使他们远离潘查希拉而参加帝国主义者的活动——这种活动的两极是西贡和曼谷——并反对万隆原则，从而反对和平和独立的理想本身。”
