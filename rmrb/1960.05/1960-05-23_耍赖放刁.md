    The logic of the robber is bizarre. Before a robber is caught, he won't admit anything; but once caught red-handed, he resorts to shuffling and quibbling. It's clear that American planes disregarded Soviet sovereignty and intruded into Soviet territory, yet even today, when Eisenhower can't deny it, he still says "these activities had no aggressive intent." Only a robber could utter such a twisted argument. And that's not all, he even tries to bite back, saying that others shouldn't be guarding against thieves; that's truly the stance and viewpoint of a thief.
    Eisenhower, before the end of the Four-Power Summit Conference, actually issued such a preposterous and shameless statement, saying he "plans in the near future to propose to the United Nations a suggestion regarding the establishment of a United Nations aerial surveillance to detect offensive preparations." Who exactly is engaged in offensive preparations? It's precisely the United States itself; and it's not just preparation, but has repeatedly been seen in action in Korea and Cuba. What a robber's logic – wanting to rob from others, digging through their walls, and then claiming that the reason for digging through their walls is to see if they are preparing to steal from him; and he's not content with digging alone, but wants to gather a whole bunch of thieves to openly and brazenly cause trouble in other people's homes. During the Korean War, the United States dragged the United Nations into being its accomplice, turning the United Nations flag into a pirate's flag in the eyes of the Chinese and Korean people and the people of the world; now they actually want to use it again as a robber's flag to cover the shame of the American robbers, so they can openly conduct hostile reconnaissance activities in other countries' airspace. We should solemnly warn these heinous American robbers that, like rats crossing the street, everyone shouts "kill them." Your robber's idea is absolutely unworkable. Whether you paint the planes black, remove the markings, or use some fabricated excuse like "civilian meteorological reconnaissance" and "air samplers," or even fly the United Nations flag, a robber's behavior is still a robber's behavior. Nothing can conceal its ugliness or save it from the failed ending of a thief.

    耍赖放刁
    黎少岑
    强盗的逻辑是离奇古怪的。强盗在未被捉以前，是不认账的；及至当场被捉，就又耍赖放刁了。明明是美国飞机蔑视苏联主权，闯入苏联国土，艾森豪威尔直到今天无可抵赖的时候，还说什么“这些活动并没有侵略的意图”。这个歪理只有强盗才讲得出口。这还不算，倒咬一口，说是别人不该防贼，这才真是贼的立场，贼的观点。
    艾森豪威尔在四国政府首脑会议结束前竟发表出这样谎谬无耻的声明，说他“计划在不久的将来向联合国提出一项关于建立联合国的空中监视来侦察进攻准备的建议”。究竟谁在搞进攻准备？正是美国自己；而且，还不只是准备而已，在朝鲜、在古巴，还曾一再地见诸事实。好一个强盗道理，自己要抢别人的，挖了别人的墙，反而说，他之所以挖人的墙，就是要去看别人是不是准备偷他的；他一个人挖还不够劲，还要去纠合一大伙贼人来明火执仗地在别人家里闹咧。在朝鲜战争中，美国就曾拖住联合国做帮凶，使联合国的旗帜在中朝人民和世界人民眼中成了海盗的旗帜；现在竟然想再把它作为强盗旗帜来遮它美国强盗的羞，好让它们公开地在别国的领空上进行敌对的侦察活动；应该正告这些万恶的美国强盗，老鼠过街，人人叫打，你们的这个强盗主意是绝对行不通的。无论是把飞机涂墨，标志涂掉，或者是利用些什么“民用气象侦察”和“空气取样器”等胡诌，乃至打上联合国的旗帜，强盗行为始终还是强盗行为，任何东西都遮不了它的丑，也挽救不了做贼的失败下场。
