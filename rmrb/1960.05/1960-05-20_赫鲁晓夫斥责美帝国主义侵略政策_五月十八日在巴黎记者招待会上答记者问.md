Xinhua News Agency, Paris, May 19th. TASS reported from Paris on May 18th: Over two thousand journalists, cameramen, and radio and television reporters gathered in the press room to attend the press conference held by Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev. When Khrushchev and his entourage appeared, they were greeted with prolonged applause. Only a small group of people posing as journalists attempted to disrupt the order with hostile shouts, but these shouts were drowned out by the applause and cheers of the vast majority of journalists.

Gromyko: I declare the press conference open. First, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, will make a statement, and then, as usual, questions will be asked and answered. Questions can be submitted in writing or orally.

Khrushchev made a statement (the full text of the statement was published in yesterday's newspaper)

Gentlemen, now I want to answer those who are "hissing," shouting, and trying to create an unfriendly atmosphere here. I have been told that Chancellor Adenauer's aides sent those Nazi spies who were not killed by us under Stalingrad here. Everyone still remembers the Hitler bandits' "hissing" invasion of the Soviet Union, but the Soviet people "hissed" them so hard that they sent many of these robbers six feet under the ground in one go. (Thunderous applause) I want to tell those gentlemen who are hissing here, we killed the German fascist bandits in Stalingrad, in Ukraine, in Belarus, in every place they attacked us; we wiped them out wherever they attacked us from. If those fascist bandits who have not yet been killed are still "hissing" at us, just like the Hitler bandits did; if they still want to attack the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, then we will "hiss" them so hard that they won't even be able to collect their bones. (Thunderous applause. Shouts: "Right!" "Long live peace!" But some dissenting shouts could also be heard)

Gentlemen! I remind you that the "hissers" understand Russian without translation. This can be seen from their shouts. These are probably some of the Hitler robbers who once invaded the Soviet Union but were not killed and dragged back two legs. (Lively, unanimous applause)

I want to tell you, gentlemen, that even those who are shouting and hissing here should understand who they are dealing with. I am the representatives of the great Soviet people—who, under the leadership of Lenin and the Communist Party, completed the great October Socialist Revolution—the representatives of the people who have built socialism and are victoriously building a communist society, confidently marching towards communism. (Thunderous applause)

Gentlemen! Those who are shouting and hissing here are people despised by the German people! (Applause)

Someone shouts: This is propaganda!

Khrushchev: You hear, for him, this is "propaganda." What kind of propaganda is this! We use all our actions to show what kind of propaganda this is! (Lively atmosphere)

I want to tell those who want to interrupt me with shouts that they are not representatives of the German people, but fascist hybrids. These malicious shouts make me happy, because it shows the madness of the enemies of our sacred cause. I am reminded of the words of the great German, August Bebel, who said that if the enemies of the working class curse you, then you are on the right path. (Unanimous applause)

Your "hissing" at me can only increase my courage in the class struggle we are waging for the cause of the working class, and increase my courage to fight for the lasting peace desired by the people of all countries. (Thunderous applause)

Gentlemen! I don't want to hide my satisfaction from you - I like to fight with the enemies of the working class. I really enjoy listening to the rage of the lackeys of imperialism. (Lively, applause) But they cannot stop us from moving forward in the slightest. Our socialist motherland, the socialist countries, stand as firm as a rock, and we will continue to advance until complete victory, until the construction of a communist society. (Thunderous and prolonged applause, cheers, individual hostile shouts could also be faintly heard. This small group of troublemakers dared not obstruct the normal progress of the press conference after being unanimously rebuffed by the vast majority of attendees.)

Thank you for your kindness, gentlemen. Now I would like to hear your questions and answer them to the best of my ability and according to the possibilities.

Grab the ears of U.S. imperialism and tell them not to carry out aggression

Stevenson, a reporter for the London newspaper "Daily Brief," asked: Could Mr. Khrushchev tell us whether the Soviet Union will continue to participate in the negotiations on the cessation of nuclear tests and disarmament in Geneva?

Khrushchev: Yes, we will continue to participate in the Geneva negotiations on the cessation of nuclear tests. I think that if the U.S. imperialists can see more clearly because we have brightened their eyes in Sverdlovsk, then it is possible to conclude a treaty on this issue. However, if President Eisenhower, as he has threatened, wants to resume testing, then we will of course also begin nuclear weapons testing. In this case, everyone will see who the real culprit is and who is the saboteur of the cessation of testing. I am confident that the truth will ultimately prevail, and the people will force those who oppose it to sign the treaty. And we are ready to conclude an agreement on the cessation of nuclear testing at any time. (Applause)

There is another question on this note - about the disarmament negotiations. We are almost completely convinced that our negotiating partner in the Geneva disarmament talks does not want disarmament. What they want is arms control without disarmament, that is, they want to carry out activities for espionage purposes. We cannot agree to do this. We want real disarmament, the destruction of weapons and the establishment of supervision, so that no one is armed and no one can threaten anyone with war. Therefore, if the Geneva disarmament negotiations continue to "drag on" as they are now, then perhaps we should appeal to the United Nations and announce that our negotiating partner is unwilling to conduct real negotiations on disarmament, and therefore request that these issues be discussed at the United Nations General Assembly. (Applause)

Rosenberg, a reporter for the West Berlin "Daily Newspaper," asked: If what you say about the U-2 aircraft incident is correct, then as a great leader of a great country, do you not think—especially since you believe you are right and that truth is on your side—that holding a summit meeting now, when international tensions are less, would be better than holding it in six to eight months?

Khrushchev: We advocate holding a summit meeting. It was for this purpose that we came to Paris. However, for this to happen, the U.S. government must acknowledge that the aggressive violation of our national borders was carried out on its instructions, demand that it condemn this act of aggression, guarantee that such actions will not be repeated, and punish the criminals. Only then will we be satisfied and be able to participate in a summit meeting to try to properly resolve the issues that have matured.

The U.S. government refuses to do this. How can we participate in the meeting when the person who committed the aggression does not want to condemn this act of aggression? You all know that the U.S. President said in his statement that flying in Soviet airspace was carried out according to the policy pursued by the United States.

Gentlemen, everyone has a mother, otherwise they would not have been born. (Lively atmosphere in the hall) I remember my mother very clearly, and my father who worked in the mines. My mother rarely had the opportunity to buy sour cream. But when we had sour cream on our table, the cat sometimes came to visit, and my mother would grab the cat's ears and shake it, pressing its nose into the remaining sour cream, then shaking it again, and pressing it again. That's how people taught a cat that climbed into a place it shouldn't have been. (Lively atmosphere in the hall)

Can't we grab the ears of the U.S. imperialists and shake them, and tell them not to carry out aggressive actions, because this violates international law and can lead to military conflict. (Applause)

Schewe, a reporter for the West German "Die Welt," asked: Do you still believe that international problems must be resolved peacefully?

Khrushchev: Yes, I do. The policy of the Soviet government is guided by the principle that all disputes must be resolved through negotiations rather than through war. We have always adhered to this position in the past and will continue to do so in the future.

The Soviet Union intends to conclude a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic, thereby depriving Western countries of the right to maintain occupation forces in West Berlin

Schewe, a reporter for "Die Welt," asked: Do you still adhere to your proposal to turn West Berlin into a free city?

Khrushchev: Yes, we adhere to this policy, and we see no other wise solution. West Berlin is located in the center of the German Democratic Republic, where the socialist system has triumphed, but West Berlin has a capitalist system. The occupation system that now exists in West Berlin may become a source of large-scale conflict. Why preserve such a source? Isn't it better to bring the situation in West Berlin into a state that avoids conflict? We believe that the best solution is to withdraw foreign troops from West Berlin, declare it a free city, create conditions for the residents of the free city to live under the political and social system that they deem necessary, and ensure the city's residents' connections with the world.

The conflict caused by the U.S. aircraft entering Soviet airspace has further convinced us that these issues must be resolved. Now, we want to strive to achieve this with greater determination and perseverance. By the way, tomorrow I will fly from here to Berlin. There, we will talk with Comrade Ulbricht, Comrade Grotewohl, and our other friends in the German Democratic Republic.

Rosenberg, a reporter for the West Berlin "Daily Newspaper," asked: Mr. Chairman, do you intend to conclude a peace treaty unilaterally in Berlin?

Khrushchev: Yes, we have plans: not a unilateral peace treaty, but to conclude a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic, finally ending World War II, thereby depriving Western countries of the right to maintain occupation forces in West Berlin. When we think it is necessary to do so, we will take out a pen from our pocket - the draft is already prepared - sit down, sign it, and publish it.

I would like to add the following to this question. What we are doing after concluding a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic is actually what the United States did when it concluded a peace treaty with Japan. We fought against Japan together with the United States. The United States concluded a peace treaty with Japan, even though we did not sign it. We spent a lot of effort to prove the need to sign a treaty together, but they did not consider our opinion. Now, all our efforts to reach an agreement and jointly conclude a peace treaty with Germany seem to be almost completely exhausted. When these efforts are completely exhausted, we, and of course other countries that defeated Hitler's Germany, will conclude a peace treaty in the same way that the Americans concluded a peace treaty with Japan.

Michaels, a reporter for NBC, asked: Since you knew about these flights, why didn't you tell President Eisenhower about this situation when you visited the United States?

Khrushchev: I am happy to answer this question. When I was talking with President Eisenhower at Camp David, I thought about it: let's talk about it. At that time, I wanted to open my mouth and tell him about this matter. At that time, I was talking very well with Eisenhower. The President said to me: Mr. Chairman, please call me "My Friend" (in English). I will also use Russian to call you "My Friend." Straightforwardly, like brothers. At that time, I wanted to say to my friend: it is not good to fly over a friend's territory without permission. But then I thought about it and decided: no, it's not worth talking about. From some things about this friend, it seems that it is not appropriate to be completely frank with him. So I decided not to talk about it. I now think that my suspicions at the time were correct, and this is now confirmed. As the saying goes, we caught the American thief—the tail of the spy. We said to the Americans, your behavior is the behavior of a thief. They said, no, this is our policy. We have flown over in the past, and we will continue to fly over your country's airspace to conduct reconnaissance work in the future. Under such conditions, can a summit meeting begin?

We caught the thief and shot down the plane. In our mines (where I was educated), when we caught a cat climbing into a pigeon nest, we would grab its tail and throw it from the pigeon nest to the ground. After that, this cat was better educated.

Shaw, a reporter for CBS, asked: Mr. Khrushchev, whether you like it or not, you have become a factor in the American election campaign. Can you talk about what kind of future president you would like to deal with? (Laughter in the hall)

Khrushchev: It is difficult for me to answer this question, but I will try my best to answer it.

When I visited the United States, I talked to many Americans—among them were ordinary people, rich people, workers and farmers, representatives of the capitalist world, and state activists. I can say that most of the people I talked to left me with good, even pleasant, memories. People, as people, want to live in peace.

Of course, we have different ideological views. However, this is not an object of military conflict. I disagree with the objections of people who stand on the capitalist position, and the capitalist advocates of communism do not agree with my opinions either. This is a matter of belief, not an object of conflict, let alone a reason for war. And I believe that the vast majority of Americans regret what has happened, regret sending spy planes to the Soviet Union, and many Americans are outraged by this.

Let's assume that there may be so-called deceived people. I don't know how the translator translates the Russian word "deceived." This word powerfully expresses the essence of the matter in this context. Perhaps the American aggressive group can temporarily create some kind of fanaticism, clamoring loudly about the Soviet Union shooting down a U.S. plane. However, what would happen if our military planes flew over the United States? Naturally, the Americans would shoot it down. I think it would be right to do so. It is not okay to fly over another country's airspace without permission, because if you do so, war will definitely break out.

However, what kind of American president do I want to deal with? I have a person in mind who, if he were the president, we (I firmly believe this) would solve the problem with him.

I am reminded of the great American Roosevelt, who was indeed a wise state activist. He deserved to be a representative of the capitalist world. He understood that he must live in peace with our socialist country, and we cooperated very well with him during the war. He died, and the policy of the United States changed. But we believe that there will be wise people in the United States who will take power - life itself will guarantee this, and we will have good and friendly relations with the United States. This is exactly what we hope for—to have the best and most friendly relations with the United States. We have no disputes with the United States that cannot be resolved through peaceful means.

Of course, the social systems are different: we live under the socialist system and are building communism, while capitalism dominates in the United States. However, this is an internal matter for the people of each country.

As for the Soviet people, they have actually confirmed the superiority of our system over the capitalist system. Gentlemen, go to our country. We are even prepared to give visas to those Hitlerites who are making noise here and have not been eliminated by us. Maybe there are such people among them. You can see what we have done to our country. In the past, this was one of the most backward countries, and now the Soviet Union ranks second in the world in terms of economic development, and first in the world in terms of political and cultural development. As for the development of new science, we also occupy our rightful place—I want to talk about this modestly, but everyone knows what position we occupy in science. (Applause)

I don't want to interfere in the American election campaign. We should be patient and respect the American people. I think that the American people do not need me to tell them who they should elect as president. I believe they will show wisdom themselves and elect a competent president for themselves. What if they elect such an incompetent person: it will be difficult to reach an agreement with this person, and he still does not understand that he must live in peace with all countries—whether capitalist or socialist? We will still have to endure and wait for the next election. If a president who does not understand the necessity of peaceful coexistence is elected again at that time, then we will endure again. What are we busy with?!

Our cause is solid, and our path is correct. We adhere to the communist line. In the future, we will continue to march along this road under the banner of Marxism-Leninism. We believe that you will follow us sooner or later. We will not blame you for being backward. On the contrary, we will help you and introduce you to the experience of socialist construction, which is beneficial to the people of all countries.

If the imperialists are still running around everywhere, the Soviet Union will also strike against the aggressors and strike at the bases that allow the aggressors to invade Soviet territory.

Smaje, a reporter for the Paris "Combat," asked: Mr. Chairman, despite the U-2 aircraft incident and knowing the extreme position taken by the United States, you still agreed to come to Paris. Undoubtedly, you believe that France will take a mediating attitude. Why, in this case, did you not consider the wishes and actions of General de Gaulle and ease up? However, do you think these actions will help the cause of peace?

Khrushchev: Why did we come? We originally thought that the American representatives would show at least a sincere attitude and apologize. Moreover, there had been such an incident before. When their plane invaded Cuba and was shot down by the Cubans, they apologized to Cuba. Since their plane invaded Soviet airspace and was shot down, why wouldn't they apologize to the Soviet Union? But we were wrong. It turned out that they can apologize to Cuba, but they are unwilling to apologize to socialist countries. But what's wrong with that? That's their business. It seems that they are raised that way. That's how gentlemen behave.

Now let's talk about the efforts of French President de Gaulle. We have a high opinion of these efforts. I think he really did everything he could to try to make the meeting possible. However, as everyone can see, nothing came of it, and it's not our fault.

If I were to answer why General de Gaulle's efforts were not successful, then I would ask the reporter of this newspaper to ask the French President, because he has talked with Eisenhower. I have no way to tell you why President de Gaulle's efforts did not get positive results.

What might be the outcome of this event? Of course, this is an unpleasant event. But even after the end of the war, after the enemy is defeated, a peace treaty is concluded, and after a period of time, the belligerent countries will also begin to live in peace. We are not at war with the United States. The Americans have been eyeing other people's vegetable gardens, and the imperialists have been slapped in the face. I think they now know where the Soviet border is! If they are still running around everywhere, we will continue to fight, and we will not only fight the aggressors, but also fight the bases that allow the aggressors to invade Soviet territory.

This spy flight has affected the relations between the Soviet Union and the United States. However, in the end, these consequences must be eliminated, and all this must be, as people say, "digested," and relations must be normalized, so that the American people and the Soviet people can live in peace—and I have already said—not only live in peace, but also live in friendship.

I believe that General de Gaulle clearly thinks so. But his situation is very difficult. The French President may not agree with my statement. However, for the sake of fairness, I would like to say that Mr. de Gaulle is a person who does what he says.

The aggressive actions taken by the United States should be condemned, and there can be no other way to do so. You can't say that a thief stole something to keep as a "souvenir" and just forgot to return it. No, a thief who is caught on the spot can only be called a thief, and there can be no two opinions here.

But I understand that the difficulty is that this thief turns out to be an ally of France, and is even considered the leader. But I don't intend to go into detail here. It is difficult for me to judge here, you know, the matter involves the relationship between allies.

I honestly tell you that if our allies did this, we would muster the courage to say that it should not be done, and if it has been done, then an apology should be made. That's the communist morality, and the morality of capitalist countries is obviously different.

I would like to add a few words. If someone understands the questions raised to me as meaning that what has happened will have some impact on the relations between France and the Soviet Union, then I will answer this way: I think all this does not affect the relations that have already been formed between us and France. I am satisfied with today's conversation with General de Gaulle. I feel that he wants to continue to pursue a policy of improving relations with the Soviet Union. We also hope so. We respect France, the French people and their culture, and we also respect the President of the French Republic.

We leave France for the Soviet Union with confidence, believing that relations between our two countries will not only not deteriorate, but will also improve.

Jakobs, a reporter for Berlin Radio (German Democratic Republic), asked: According to American newspapers, U.S. Defense Secretary Gates issued an order from Paris on Monday, declaring the U.S. Air Force on war alert. What do you think of this?

Khrushchev: I have not heard this news. If things are really as you said (I have no reason not to believe you), then this is a provocative activity to complicate the situation, and I want to say that this is to intimidate the American people. This is to deceive the Americans, so that it is easier to collect taxes from the people for military purposes.

Perhaps, Gates' actions are out of timidity. However, cowards, like provocateurs, are equally dangerous: provocateurs provoke war, and cowards sometimes launch wars out of fear.

I don't know Gates, and I don't know how much he is worth; let the Americans be responsible for him, because he is the American minister. I can only be responsible for my friend Malinovsky, who is an outstanding soldier. In the First World War, he fought bravely with the French against German imperialism. He also fought bravely in the years of the Second World War, commanding a large army against Hitler and Japanese imperialists. He has won many awards and is now the Soviet Minister of Defense. I can vouch for him. He is a loyal son of the Communist Party and a loyal son of the motherland.

Malinovsky: We have not issued a war alert!

Khrushchev: Right. He did not issue an alert, and we will not issue an alert either. Our nerves are strong. (Applause) If the U.S. imperialists want to act by intimidation, then let them go to other countries to find people who are easily frightened. This does not work for us. You know, we have full possibility to teach the provocateurs a lesson, just like teaching those cats that sneak into other people's pigeon nests. As long as a cat sneaks into our pigeon nest, we will teach it a lesson.

I suppose that the American imperialist group will want to make a lot of money on this matter; it seems that they will increase the taxes on the people, increase the orders for arms, thereby squeezing more money from the people, and this money will be transferred to the monopoly capital that manufactures arms in the form of profits.

We have a different policy. The most recent session of the Supreme Soviet passed a resolution to stop collecting taxes from employees. By 1965, no worker or employee in the Soviet Union will pay taxes. This year, we will complete the transition to a seven-hour workday for all employees and a six-hour workday for miners. (At this time, the lights in the hall went out and the speakers stopped working) ... Capitalist technology has malfunctioned. Well, I will shout my words into your ears! (Cheers)

Gentlemen, I want to talk to you again. By 1964, we will begin the transition to a six-hour workday for employees, and miners will work five hours a day. This is the policy of the socialist country, and we will never deviate from this policy. Provocative acts cannot divert our people from the path of building a communist society. This is a reliable policy, the policy of the Soviet state, the Soviet government, and the policy of our Communist Party. (The lights in the hall came back on, applause, cheers, laughter)

Krautz, a reporter for "Neues Deutschland" (German Democratic Republic), asked: Mr. Chairman, what do you think is the reason why Eisenhower changed his attitude after your Camp David talks? Can you explain the reason for the difference between the U.S. President's attitude at Camp David and his attitude in Paris now?

Khrushchev: To some extent, my answer above is an answer to this question. Someone here said that the U.S. Air Force has declared a war alert. This fact just shows that the most reactionary forces in the United States—the Pentagon, the militarists—are rampant. They are putting pressure on the President. It was they who sent the plane to our country—of course, with the permission of Mr. President. I think that the changes that have taken place in American policy after our talks with President Eisenhower at Camp David can be explained in this way.

The Soviet Union heartily welcomes and sympathizes with the struggle of the Latin American people for independence and against U.S. imperialism, and sympathizes with all the people of all countries who are fighting for freedom and independence.

Andrade, a reporter for the "Brazilian Daily," asked: Mr. Chairman, please answer the following three questions. Do you plan to visit Latin American countries in the near future? How do you evaluate the status of Latin American countries in the world? Do you think that Latin American countries can also participate in the peaceful resolution of issues that have matured, just like other countries?

Khrushchev: The first question, that is, whether I can visit Brazil? My answer is that no one has invited me to visit there yet. However, if I receive an invitation to visit Latin American countries, then I will try my best to go there. As for the second question, we are happy about what is happening in Latin American countries: we clearly feel the pulse of the struggle of these countries for independence and against American imperialism. The reception that the people there gave to Mr. Nixon when he visited Latin America was a very clear signal.

We salute the Cuban people, who bravely raised the banner of fighting for their own independence, for Cuban independence, and who want to be the masters of their own country and the masters of the fruits of their labor. We are convinced that the people of other countries in Latin America who are rising up to fight for their own independence will also embark on this path.

We sympathize with all the people of all countries who are fighting for their own freedom and independence, and rejoice in the achievements they have made in this just struggle. (Applause)

We believe that Latin American countries will muster their energy, and their role in international politics will increase.

It should be said that, unfortunately, there are still some countries in Latin America whose governments squeeze money from their own people but serve U.S. imperialism. However, the people of Latin American countries are awakening. We heartily welcome and sympathize with their liberation movement. Only when the people of Latin American countries truly have governments that faithfully serve their own people can the voice of Latin American countries be raised in the international arena. This voice of the Latin American people can resound more loudly in the United Nations and in all international affairs, and this will be beneficial to all countries and to the cause of world peace.

Gentlemen, I intend to continue the press conference, but my translators are whispering to me that their workday has ended. (Cheers) They told me that our labor law stipulates the protection of their interests, and they said: Comrade Chairman, please end the press conference, otherwise we will end it ourselves without your permission. (Cheers)

Once again, I heartily thank the French government, President de Gaulle, the French people, and the Parisians for their hospitality, and not just the Parisians—yesterday Marshal Malinovsky and I went to the countryside where he was stationed during the First World War when he fought against the Germans with the French. We would like to express our sincere thanks and friendly wishes to all the French people who have received us so kindly.

As the press conference is about to end, I would like to emphasize once again that the Soviet Union will continue to adhere to the position of peaceful coexistence between the capitalist system and the socialist system in the future. We will continue to steadfastly implement a policy of maintaining peace, so that disputes between countries can be resolved through negotiations. However, we will firmly adhere to the position of defending our sovereignty and the sovereignty of the people of all socialist countries, and we will resolutely respond to any attempt to invade our country. I think that our policy will be understood and supported by the people of all countries, because it is the only possible correct policy. This policy will not cause losses to anyone or any country. On the contrary, it can guarantee the peaceful coexistence and peaceful development of all countries and all mankind.

Goodbye! Thank you! I wish you success and please report truthfully, so that your pens serve the cause of peace and friendship between the people of all countries.

Vive la paix! (Long live peace!) (Thunderous applause).

专栏：

    赫鲁晓夫斥责美帝国主义侵略政策
    五月十八日在巴黎记者招待会上答记者问
    新华社19日讯　塔斯社巴黎18日电：两千多名记者、电影摄影师、广播电台和电视摄影记者18日聚集在记者站大厅参加苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫举行的记者招待会。赫鲁晓夫及其随行人员出现时，人们报以经久不息的掌声。只有一小撮冒充记者的人企图以敌意的叫喊破坏秩序，然而这种叫喊被绝大多数记者的掌声和赞许声淹没了。
    葛罗米柯：我宣布记者招待会开始。首先由苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫发表声明，然后，和往常一样提出问题和回答问题。问题可以用书面提出，或口头提出。
    赫鲁晓夫发表声明（声明全文见昨日本报）
    先生们，现在我要回答那一批在这里“嘘嘘”、叫嚷，企图制造不友好气氛的人。有人告诉我，阿登纳总理的助手把他们没有被我们在斯大林格勒城下打死的法西斯特务派到这里来了。大家对希特勒匪徒“嘘嘘地”入侵苏联一事，记忆犹新，但是苏联人民是那样“嘘嘘了”他们，把这些强盗中的许多人一下子赶进了三尺深的地下。（暴风雨般的掌声）我想告诉那些在这里发出嘘声的先生们，——我们打死了德国法西斯强盗，在斯大林格勒城下、在乌克兰、在白俄罗斯，在他们进攻的各个地方，他们从哪里进攻我们，我们就把他们消灭在哪个地方。如果那些还没有被打死的法西斯强盗仍对我们“嘘嘘”，就像希特勒匪徒所干的那样；如果还想进攻苏联和其他社会主义国家，那么我们将把他们“嘘嘘”得连骨头也收不回去。（暴风雨般的掌声。喊声：“对！”、“和平万岁！”但也可以听到个别反对的叫嚷）
    先生们！我提醒你们注意，“嘘嘘叫喊的人”懂俄语而无需经过翻译。这从他们的叫喊中可以看出来。这大概是一些曾经入侵苏联、但是没有被打死而拖回了两条腿的希特勒强盗。（活跃、一致鼓掌）
    我想告诉你们，先生们，即使是那些在这里叫嚷和发出嘘声的人也应该明白，他们是在跟谁打交道的。我是伟大的苏联人民——他们在列宁的领导下，在共产党的领导下完成了伟大的十月社会主义革命——的代表，是建成了社会主义并正在胜利地建设着共产主义社会、充满信心地向共产主义迈进的人民的代表。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    先生们！在这里叫嚷和发出嘘声的人是一些为德国人民所不齿的人！（掌声）
    有人喊：这是宣传！
    赫鲁晓夫：你们听，对他来说，这是“宣传”。这是什么宣传！我们用自己的一切行动来表明，这是什么样的宣传！（场内活跃）
    我要告诉那些想要用叫喊来打断我的话的人，他们不是德国人民的代表，而是法西斯的混种。这些恶意的叫喊倒使我感到高兴，因为它表明了我们神圣事业的敌人的疯狂。我记起了一位伟大的德国人奥古斯特·倍倍尔的话，他说，如果工人阶级的敌人咒骂你，那就是说，你的路走对了。（一致鼓掌）
    你们向我“嘘嘘”，这只能增加我在我们为工人阶级的事业进行的阶级斗争中的勇气，增加我为各国人民渴望的持久和平而斗争的勇气。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    先生们！我不愿意向你们掩盖我的满意的心情——我喜欢同工人阶级的敌人斗一斗。我很喜欢听帝国主义走狗的狂怒。（活跃、掌声）但是，他们丝毫也不能阻止我们前进。我们的社会主义祖国、社会主义国家像磐石般牢固地屹立着，我们仍将前进，直到彻底胜利，达到建成共产主义社会。（暴风雨般经久不息的掌声、赞许声、也可以隐隐听到个别的敌意叫喊。这一小撮捣乱分子遭到了绝大多数与会者一致的回击后，不敢再阻挠记者招待会的正常进行了。）
    感谢你们的盛意，先生们。现在我想听听你们的问题，并且尽我的力量和根据可能性来回答这些问题。
    抓住美帝国主义的耳朵，告诉他们不许进行侵略
    伦敦报纸“每日简报”记者史蒂文森问：赫鲁晓夫先生能不能告诉我们：苏联是否将继续参加在日内瓦举行的关于不继续核试验的谈判和裁军的谈判？
    赫鲁晓夫：是的，我们将继续参加日内瓦不继续核试验谈判。我想，如果美帝国主义者由于我们在斯维德洛夫斯克擦亮了他们的眼睛而看得比较清楚一些，那么，就这个问题缔结条约是可能的。但是，如果艾森豪威尔总统像他所扬言的那样，要恢复试验，那么，我们当然也要开始核武器试验。在这种情况下，一切人们都会看到谁是真正的罪人，谁是停止试验的破坏者。我确信，真理终究会胜利，人民将迫使那些反对的人在条约上签字。而我们准备随时缔结有关停止核试验的协议。（掌声）
    在这个纸条上还有另一个问题——关于裁军谈判的问题。我们几乎完全相信，我们的日内瓦裁军谈判对方不愿意裁军。他们希望的是没有裁军的军备监督，即他们想要抱着间谍目的进行活动。我们不能同意这样做。我们希望真正的裁军、销毁武器和建立监督，从而使谁也不武装，谁也不能用战争来威胁谁。因此，如果像现在日内瓦裁军问题谈判那样，继续“拖延”下去，那么，也许我们要向联合国呼吁，并宣布，我们的对方不愿意就裁军进行真正的谈判，因此要求在联合国大会讨论这些问题。（掌声）
    西柏林“日报”记者罗森堡问：如果说，您对U—2型飞机事件的说法是正确的，那么你作为一个大国的伟大的领导者是否认为，——何况您相信自己是正义的，相信真理是在您这一方面——在现在国际紧张气氛较少的时候举行最高级会议不比在六个月到八个月以后举行更好吗？
    赫鲁晓夫：我们主张举行最高级会议。正是为了这个目的，我们才到巴黎来。但是，为此，必须要美国政府承认，对我国国境的侵略性的侵犯是按照它的指令进行的，要求它谴责这种侵略行为，并保证这种行动不再重演，而且要惩办罪犯。到那时我们才会感到满意，才能够参加最高级会议来设法正确解决已经成熟了的问题。
    美国政府拒绝这样做，在进行侵略的人不想谴责这种侵略行为的情况下，我们怎么能够参加会议呢？你们都知道，美国总统在他的声明中说，在苏联领空飞行是根据美国所奉行的政策进行的。
    先生们，大家都有母亲，否则，就不会出世。（大厅活跃）我非常清楚地记得我的母亲，我的在矿山里工作的父亲。母亲很少有可能买到酸奶油。但是，当我们的饭桌上有了酸奶油时，猫有时就来光顾，母亲便揪住猫的耳朵摇摔它，把它的鼻子捺到残剩的酸奶油里，然后再摇摔，再按捺。人们就是这样教训那只爬到不该去的地方的猫的。（大厅活跃）
    难道不能抓住美帝国主义者的耳朵摇摔，并告诉他们，不许进行侵略行动，因为这破坏了国际法，并会导致军事冲突。（掌声）
    西德“世界报”记者舍韦问：您是否仍然认为，国际问题必须用和平的方式解决？
    赫鲁晓夫：是的，我是这样认为。苏联政府的政策中所遵循的是：一切争端必须通过谈判而不是通过战争来解决。我们过去和今后始终要坚持这一立场。
    苏联打算同德意志民主共和国缔结和约，从而剥夺西方国家在西柏林保持占领部队的权利
    “世界报”记者舍韦问：您是否仍然坚持您的把西柏林变为自由城市的建议？
    赫鲁晓夫：是的，我们坚持的正是这一政策，我们看不出还有什么其他明智的解决办法。西柏林位于社会主义制度已经取得胜利的德意志民主共和国的中心，但是西柏林却存在着资本主义制度。在西柏林现在存在的占领制度可能成为大规模冲突的源泉。为什么要保存这样的源泉呢？把西柏林的局势引向避免冲突的状态不是更好些吗。我们认为，最好的解决办法是从西柏林撤出外国军队，宣布它为自由城市，为自由城市的居民创造条件，使他们能够在他们认为有必要存在的政治和社会制度下生活，并保证这个城市的居民同全世界的联系。
    由于美机侵入苏联领空而产生的冲突使我们更加坚信这些问题必须解决。现在，我们要以更大的决心和毅力争取达到这一点。顺便说说，明天我就要从这里飞向柏林。在那里，我们将同乌布利希同志、格罗提渥同志以及我们的德意志民主共和国的其他朋友谈一谈。
    西柏林“日报”记者罗森堡问：主席先生，您是否打算在柏林单方面媾和呢？
    赫鲁晓夫：是的，我们有打算：不是单方面的媾和，而是同德意志民主共和国缔结和约，最后结束第二次世界大战，从而剥夺西方国家在西柏林保持占领部队的权利。当我们认为有这样做的必要时，就从口袋中掏出钢笔来——草案已经准备好了——坐下来签字并发表。
    对这一问题我想补充下面一点。我们同德意志民主共和国缔结和约以后，我们所做的其实就是美国同日本缔结和约时所做的事。我们同美国一起跟日本打过仗。美国同日本缔结了和约，尽管我们没有在上面签字。我们花了很多精力来证明共同签订条约的必要性，但是他们不考虑我们的意见。现在，我们力求达成协议并共同缔结对德和约的一切努力看来差不多已经完全用尽了。当这些努力完全用尽时，我们、当然还有战胜希特勒德国的其他国家，将要像美国人同日本缔结和约时所做的那样来缔结和约。
    美国全国广播公司记者迈克尔斯问：既然您知道这些飞行，为什么在您访问美国时没有把这种情况告诉艾森豪威尔总统呢？
    赫鲁晓夫：我乐于回答这个问题。当我同艾森豪威尔总统在戴维营会谈时，我想了一想：说吧，当时我想开口，对他说这件事情。我当时同艾森豪威尔谈得很好。总统对我说：主席先生，请叫我一声“马埃弗伦德”（英语“我的朋友”）（全场欢跃），我对你也将用俄语称呼“我的朋友”。直截了当地像兄弟一样。当时我想对我的朋友说：在朋友的领土上未经允许就飞行是不好的。但后来我又想了想，并决定：不，不值得讲。从这个朋友身上有些东西看来，是不宜于对他彻底开诚布公的。所以决定不讲。我现在想，我当时的怀疑是正确的，现在这点证实了，真像俗话所说，我们抓住了美国贼——间谍的尾巴。我们对美国人说，你们的行为是贼的行为。他们却说，不，这是我们的政策，我们过去飞过，将来仍然要飞到你们国家的领空进行侦探工作。在这样的条件下，难道可以开始最高级会议吗？
    我们抓住了贼，打下了飞机。在我们矿山里，（我是在那里受到教养的）抓住了爬到鸽子窝去的猫的时候，就抓住它的尾巴，把它从鸽子窝里扔到地上，此后，这只猫就更好地受到教训了。
    哥伦比亚广播公司记者肖尔问：赫鲁晓夫先生，不管您愿意不愿意，您已经成为美国选举运动中的一个因素，你是否可以谈谈，你愿意同什么样未来的总统打交道？（场内笑声）
    赫鲁晓夫：我很难回答这个问题，但是还是尽量回答。
    当我在美国访问时，我同许多美国人谈过话——他们之中有普通人、有钱的人、工人和农民、资本主义世界的代表人物以及国家活动家。我可以说，同我谈过话的大多数人给我留下了很好的、甚至愉快的回忆。人，作为人，他们希望过和平生活。
    当然，我们有不同的思想观点。但是，这不是军事冲突的对象。我不同意站在资本主义立场上的人们的反对意见，而不承认共产主义思想的资本主义拥护者也不同意我的意见。这是信仰问题，不是冲突的对象，更不是进行战争的理由。而且我相信，绝大多数美国人对于已发生的事情感到遗憾，对于向苏联派遣间谍飞机一事感到遗憾，而且不少美国人对此感到愤慨。
    姑且假定，可能有所谓被愚弄的人。我不知道，翻译员怎么翻译“愚弄”这个俄文字眼，这个字眼在这一场合很有力地表现了事情的实质。也许美国侵略集团可以暂时造成某种狂热，围绕苏联击落美国飞机一事大肆叫嚷。可是，如果我们的军用飞机在美国上空飞行，会怎样呢？自然，美国人会把它击落。我认为，这样做将是正确的。不经允许而在别国领空飞行是不行的，因为如果这样做的话，就一定会爆发战争。
    然而，我希望同什么样的美国总统打交道呢？我有一个看中的人，如果他是总统，我们同他（我坚信这一点）将会解决问题。
    我想起了伟大的美国人罗斯福，他的确是一位英明的国家活动家，他不愧为资本主义世界的代表。他明白必须同我们社会主义国家和平相处，而我们同他在战时合作得很好。他死了，美国的政策也改变了。但是我们相信，美国将会有明智的人来掌握政权——生活本身将保证这一点，而我们也将同美国有良好的、友好的关系。我们希望的正是这一点——同美国有最好的、最友好的关系。我们同美国没有不能通过和平途径来解决的争执问题。
    当然，彼此的社会制度不同：我们生活在社会主义制度下，并建设着共产主义，而在美国占统治地位的是资本主义。但是，这是每个国家人民内部的问题。
    至于苏联人民，他们实际上证实了我们的制度对资本主义制度的优越性。先生们，到我们那里去吧。我们甚至准备给那些在这里吵吵闹闹的、没有被我们消灭掉的希特勒分子签证。也许他们中间有这样的人。你们可以看看我们对我们的国家做了些什么。过去，这是最落后的国家之一，而现在苏联在经济发展方面占世界第二位，而在政治和文化发展方面是占世界第一位的国家。至于新科学的发展，那么，我们也占有应有的地位——我想谦虚地谈这一点，但是大家都知道我们在科学方面占有怎样的地位。（掌声）
    我不想干涉美国的竞选运动。应该有耐心，要尊重美国人民。我想，美国人民不需要我来指点他们应该选谁做总统。我相信他们自己会表现出明智，给自己选一位称职的总统。如果他们选出这样一个不称职的人：同这个人将很难达成协议，他仍不理解必须同所有国家——无论资本主义国家还是社会主义国家——和平相处的话，那又怎么样呢，我们仍要忍耐，等待下一次选举。如果那时又选出一位不理解和平共处的必要性的总统，那么，我们将再度忍耐。我们忙什么呢？！
    我们的事业是牢靠的，我们的道路是正确的。我们坚持着共产主义的方针。我们今后仍将在马克思列宁主义的旗帜下沿着这条道路进军。我们相信，你们迟早会跟着我们走的。我们不会责备你们落后。相反，我们将帮助你们，将向你们介绍社会主义建设的经验，这种经验对世界各国人民都是有益的。
    帝国主义者如果还到处乱闯，苏联还要给侵略者以打击，并打击让侵略者用来侵入苏联领土的基地
    巴黎“战斗报”记者斯马日问：主席先生，尽管发生了U—2型飞机事件，并且知道美国采取的极端立场，而你还是同意到巴黎来了。毫无疑问你是相信法国将采取调解态度的。为什么在这种情况下你没有考虑戴高乐将军的意愿和行动而缓和下来呢？然而，你是否想到这些行动会有助于和平事业呢？
    赫鲁晓夫：为什么我们来了？我们原先以为，美国代表会表现出起码的诚恳态度，他们会道歉的。况且已经有过这样的事件，他们的飞机侵入古巴，被古巴人击落时，他们曾经向古巴道过歉。既然他们的飞机侵入苏联领空而被击落，怎么会不向苏联道歉呢？但是我们想错了。原来，他们可以向古巴道歉，但是不愿向社会主义国家道歉。不过这有什么，这是他们的事。看来他们是这样教养出来的。这是绅士的行为。
    现在谈谈法国总统戴高乐先生的努力。我们对他这些努力估计很高。我认为，他真正做了他力所能及的一切想使会议能够举行。可是，大家看到，没有产生什么结果，这不是我们的过错。
  如果要我回答为什么戴高乐将军的努力没有成功，那么我请这家报纸的记者最好去问法国总统，因为他同艾森豪威尔交谈过。我没有可能告诉你们，戴高乐总统的努力为什么没有得到积极的结果。
    这个事件的结果可能会怎样呢？当然，这是一个不愉快的事件。但是，甚至在战争结束后，在敌人被击溃后缔结了和约，交战国经过一段时间也会开始和平相处。我们同美国没有战争。美国人眼睛盯到别人的菜园里来了，帝国主义者挨了嘴巴。我想，他们现在已经知道，苏联的国境在哪里！如果他们还到处乱闯，我们还要打，而且我们不光打侵略者，还要打让侵略者用来侵入苏联领土的基地。
    这种间谍飞行影响了苏美两国之间的关系。但是，终究将来必须消除这种后果，必须把这一切，像人们所说的，“消化掉”，必须使关系正常化，从而使美国人民和苏联人民和平相处，——而我已经说过——不仅和平相处，还要友好相处。
    我相信，戴高乐将军显然正是这样想的。但是他的处境是很艰难的。法国总统可能不同意我的说法。然而，为了公正起见，我想说，戴高乐先生是一位说到就做到的人。
    应当谴责美国采取的侵略行动，不可能有别的做法。不能说一个贼偷了东西是为了留作“纪念”，而只是忘记了把它还回去。不对，被当场捕获的贼只能把他叫做贼，这里是不能有两种见解的。
    但是，我明白，困难的是，这个贼原来是法国的盟国，而且还是被认为是首领的盟国。可是，在这里我不打算详细说。这里我很难判断，要知道，事情涉及到盟国之间的关系。
    我老实对你们说，如果我们的盟国做出这种事，我们就将鼓足勇气说，这样做是不应该的，而假使已经做了，那就应该道歉。共产主义的道德就是这样，而资本主义国家的道德显然是另一个样子。
    我想再补充几句。如果有人把向我提出的问题理解为所发生的一切将会对法国和苏联之间的关系有所影响的话，那么我将这样回答：我认为，这一切不影响我们同法国已经形成的关系。我对今天同戴高乐将军的交谈感到满意。我感到他想继续奉行改善同苏联的关系的政策。我们也希望这样。我们很尊重法国、法国人民和他们的文化，我们也尊重法兰西共和国的总统。
    我们怀着信心离开法国回苏联，相信我们两国之间的关系不仅不会恶化，而且将得到改善。
    柏林电台（德意志民主共和国）记者亚科布斯问：据美国报纸报道，美国国防部长盖茨星期一从巴黎发出一项命令，宣布美国空军处于战争戒备状态。您对这件事情有什么看法？
    赫鲁晓夫：我没有听到这个消息。如果事情真像您说的这样（我没有理由不相信您的话），那么，这是为了使局势复杂化而进行的挑衅活动，我要说，这是为了恫吓美国人民。这是愚弄美国人，为的是更容易向人民搜刮捐税，用于军事目的。
    也许，盖茨的行动是出于胆怯。但是，胆小鬼，跟挑衅分子一样，是同样危险的：挑衅分子挑起战争，而胆小鬼有时会由于畏惧而发动战争。
    我不了解盖茨，不知道他值几文钱；让美国人替他负责吧，因为他是美国的部长。我只能替我的朋友马利诺夫斯基负责，他是一位卓越的战士，在第一次世界大战时他曾英勇地同法国人一起跟德国帝国主义作战，在第二次世界大战的年代里也英勇地作过战，指挥过反希特勒和反日本帝国主义分子的庞大军队，他曾多次荣获奖赏，现在是苏联国防部部长。我可以为他担保。他是共产党的忠实儿子，是祖国的忠实儿子。
    马利诺夫斯基：我们没有发布战争警报！
    赫鲁晓夫：对。他没有发布警报，而我们也不会发布警报，我们的神经是坚强的。（掌声）如果美国帝国主义者想靠恫吓的方法行事，那么，就让他们到别的国家去寻找容易被吓住的人，这对我们是不起作用的。要知道我们有充分的可能教训挑衅者，就像教训那些钻进别人的鸽子窝的猫一样。猫只要一钻进我们的鸽子窝，我们就要教训它。
    我设想，美国帝国主义集团会想在这件事上大捞一笔；看来，他们将会增加人民的赋税，增加军火订货，从而向老百姓榨取更多的钱，而这些钱将以利润的形式转到制造军火的垄断资本手里去。
    我们是另外一种政策。最高苏维埃最近一次会议通过了一项决议，要停止向职工征收赋税。到1965年，苏联的任何一个工人、任何一个职员都将不再缴纳赋税。今年我们就将完成向全体职工七小时工作日和矿工六小时工作日的过渡。（这时场内灯光熄灭，播音器不响了）……资本主义技术发生了故障。好吧，我将大声把自己的话送到你们的耳朵里！（欢跃）
    先生们，我想再向你们谈一谈。到1964年，我们将开始向职工六小时工作日过渡，而矿工每天将工作五小时。这就是社会主义国家的政策，我们决不会离开这一政策。挑衅行为不能使我国人民离开建设共产主义社会的道路。这是一种可靠的政策，是苏维埃国家、苏联政府的政策，是我们共产党的政策。（场内灯光复燃，掌声，欢跃，笑声）
    “新德意志报”（德意志民主共和国）记者克劳茨问：主席先生，您认为艾森豪威尔在你们的戴维营会谈以后改变态度的原因是什么？您是否可以解释一下美国总统在戴维营的态度和现在在巴黎时的态度不同的原因？
    赫鲁晓夫：在某种程度上讲，我上边的回答就是对这一问题的回答。在这里有人说，美国空军宣布了战争警报。这一事实正好说明，美国最反动的势力——五角大楼、黩武主义者正在猖狂活动。他们在对总统施加压力。正是他们把飞机派到了我国去——当然是得到总统先生的允许的。我认为，对在我们同艾森豪威尔总统在戴维营会谈以后美国的政策中发生的变化我可以这样来解释。
    苏联衷心欢迎和同情拉丁美洲人民争取独立和反对美帝国主义的斗争，同情所有争取自由独立的各国人民
    “巴西日报”记者安德雷德问：主席先生，请你回答一下以下三个问题。您是否打算在最近访问拉丁美洲的国家？您怎样评价拉丁美洲国家在世界上的地位？您是否认为，拉丁美洲国家也能同其他国家一样参加和平解决已经成熟的问题？
    赫鲁晓夫：第一个问题，即我是否能够访问巴西？我的回答是，还没有人邀请我到那里去访问。但是，如果我接到访问拉丁美洲国家的邀请，那么我尽量到那里去。至于谈到第二个问题，我们对拉丁美洲国家所发生的事情感到高兴：我们清晰地感觉到这些国家争取独立和反对美国帝国主义的斗争的脉搏。在尼克松先生访问拉丁美洲时，那里的人民给他的那种接待是一个十分明显的讯号。
    我们向古巴人民致敬，他们勇敢地举起了争取自己独立、争取古巴独立的斗争的旗帜，他们要做自己国家的主人，做自己的劳动果实的主人。我们深信，纷纷起来为自己独立而斗争的拉丁美洲其他各国的人民也一定会走上这条道路。
    我们同情所有为争取自己的自由和独立而进行斗争的各国人民，为他们在这个正义斗争中所取得的成就而欢欣鼓舞。（掌声）
    我们相信，拉丁美洲国家将会鼓起劲头，它们在国际政治中的作用将会提高。
    应该说，遗憾的是，在拉丁美洲国家中还有这样一些国家，这些国家的政府从本国人民那里榨取钱财，却为美帝国主义效劳。但是，拉丁美洲国家的人民正在觉醒。我们衷心地欢迎和同情他们的解放运动。只有当拉丁美洲各国人民真正有了忠实地为本国人民服务的政府的时候，拉丁美洲国家才能在国际舞台上提高自己的声音。拉丁美洲人民的这种声音才能更加响亮地响彻在联合国和一切国际事务中，而这将有利于各个国家，有利于全世界的和平事业。
    先生们，我打算把记者招待会继续开下去，但是我的翻译们低声对我说，他们的工作日已经结束了。（欢跃）他们对我说，我们的劳动法规定保护他们的利益，他们说：主席同志，请您结束记者招待会吧，否则我们就要不得到您的允许自己结束它了。（欢跃）
    我再一次衷心地感谢法国政府、戴高乐总统、法国人民和巴黎人的殷勤接待，而且不仅是巴黎人，——我昨天同马利诺夫斯基元帅到他在第一次大战期间同法国人一道对德国人作战时驻扎过的农村去了一趟。我们谨对如此友好地接待我们的所有法国人表示热忱的感谢和友好的祝愿。
    在记者招待会就要结束的时候，我想再次强调指出，苏联在今后仍将坚持资本主义制度和社会主义制度这两种制度和平共处的立场。我们将继续坚定不移地执行维护和平的政策，以便使国与国之间的争执问题通过谈判的方式得到解决。但是，我们将坚决地坚持保卫我国的主权、保卫社会主义各国人民的主权的立场，我们将对侵略我国的任何企图给予坚决的回击。我认为，我们的这种政策是会得到各国人民的理解和赞同的，因为它是唯一可能的正确政策。这种政策不会给任何人、任何国家带来损失。相反，它能保证一切国家和全人类的和平共处、和和平发展。
    再见！谢谢！祝你们成功并请你们真实地报道，使你们的笔为各国人民之间的和平和友谊事业服务。
    维符——拉——亚培！（法语：和平万岁！）（暴风雨般的掌声）。
                                （文内插题是本报编者所加）
