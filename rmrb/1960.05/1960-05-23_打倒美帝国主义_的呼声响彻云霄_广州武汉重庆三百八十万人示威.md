    "Down with American Imperialism!" Resounding Slogans
    3.8 Million People Demonstrate in Guangzhou, Wuhan, and Chongqing
    A Raging Tide Rolls on the Shores of the South China Sea
    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, May 22nd: Guangzhou, a city with a glorious tradition of anti-imperialist and patriotic struggle, today saw over 800,000 people holding rallies and demonstrations, resolutely supporting the Soviet government's just stance against American imperialist aggression and provocation, and angrily condemning American imperialism for sabotaging the Four-Power Summit Conference.
    The surging tide of anger protesting the shameless American imperialist invasion of the Soviet Union and sabotage of the Four-Power Summit Conference swept through every street in Guangzhou today. Starting at noon, people from factories, schools, military units, government organs, and urban people's communes marched to the rally venues, carrying various slogans, cartoons, and flags. Yuexiu Mountain Stadium, the central venue, was packed inside and out with nearly 80,000 people, their slogans and passionate songs resounding through the sky.
    Leading Party and government officials of Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City, commanders of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Guangzhou, and responsible individuals from various democratic parties and people's organizations all participated in today's meeting. The head of the Soviet Trade Representative Office in Guangzhou, Gubankov, and Soviet experts in Guangzhou were invited to attend the meeting. Consuls from various countries stationed in Guangzhou and heads of commercial institutions stationed in Guangzhou also participated in the meeting. Foreign experts and students working in Guangzhou, as well as foreign guests from Albania, Bulgaria, Argentina, Peru, Brazil, Ceylon, Burma, Japan, and New Zealand who were visiting Guangzhou, all participated in the meeting.
    Chen Yu, member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee, and Governor of Guangdong Province, spoke at the meeting.
    He said: In order to safeguard world peace, we must resolutely counterattack the aggressive activities of American imperialism, constantly expose the nature of American imperialism, and let this man-eating jackal be exposed in broad daylight. Chen Yu solemnly pointed out that the socialist countries are closely related and share weal and woe. We must warn the United States government: an invasion of any socialist country by imperialism is an invasion of the entire socialist camp and will inevitably be met with a devastating counterattack. Our 650 million people will forever stand together with the great Soviet people and the people of other socialist countries to fight to the end against American imperialist aggression. Chen Yu's speech was constantly interrupted by enthusiastic applause and passionate slogans from the masses.
    The masses welcomed the speech of Gubankov, head of the Soviet Trade Representative Office in Guangzhou, with warm applause. He pointed out that the mass rallies held in China and other socialist countries in recent days to support the Soviet Union's just stance against American imperialist aggression and to oppose American imperialism's sabotage of the Four-Power Summit Conference prove the unbreakable unity of the socialist camp. He said: The enemy is baring its fangs and claws, so we must strengthen our vigilance, vigilantly watch all the conspiracies of imperialism, and be prepared to give the aggressors a devastating blow at any time.
    Next to speak were Xiao Junying, representative of the Guangdong and Guangzhou local organizations of various democratic parties, Guo Dihuo, vice chairman of the Guangdong Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, Chen Nengxing, representative of the people's organizations of Guangdong Province, Zhang Hanming, industrial labor model, and Zhong Xuben, agricultural labor model, among others. They pointed out that the United States government is the main culprit threatening world peace. They expressed that the Chinese people will always stand with the great Soviet people and fight resolutely to the end against American imperialist aggression and to defend world peace.
    Today, hundreds of thousands of workers, peasants, soldiers, government cadres, and citizens in Guangzhou waved red flags, held up huge banners and cartoon signs, and angrily took to the streets to demonstrate, fully demonstrating the heroic Guangzhou people's determination to oppose aggression. Militiamen composed of provincial and municipal workers, students, and government cadres, carrying brand-new submachine guns, marched proudly in the parade. Guangzhou workers, angered by the American imperialists' crime of destroying peace, held up banners and participated in the demonstration. At a rally in the Xinglong Hardware Factory of the Jinhua Commune, Zeng Fanzhen, an advanced producer, said angrily: "Imperialism is trying to cover up the essence of their aggression and pretending to be 'peaceful,' but in reality, they are preparing for new wars of aggression. We love peace, but we are not afraid of war in the slightest. If American imperialism dares to impose war on us, it will only destroy itself."
    Officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Guangzhou held rallies today in their respective garrisons. The officers and soldiers of the Tashan Defense Hero Regiment unanimously condemned the American aggression against the Soviet Union at the rally and warmly supported the just stance of Khrushchev's statement.
    More than 80,000 commune members in Conghua County, a distant suburb of Guangzhou, held demonstrations and rallies today in the rain. Peasant representative Hu Jinzhu said at the meeting: The moribund American imperialism dares to launch shameless aggression and provocation against the Soviet Union. Such heinous crimes are absolutely intolerable. The crimes of American imperialism in going against the tide of history cannot save it from its declining fate. We believe that relying on the power of the people can defeat imperialism and defend world peace. Mass rallies and demonstrations of ten thousand people were held in Liang Kou, Longshan and other communes in Conghua County.
    
    Wuhan's Three Towns Seethe with Emotion
    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, May 22nd: Today, 1.5 million people in Wuhan held an unprecedented rally and demonstration, resolutely supporting the Soviet government's just stance against American imperialist aggression and condemning the American imperialist crime of sabotaging the Four-Power Summit Conference. People are determined to work with the people of the whole country, the Soviet people, and the people of the world to completely smash the evil conspiracies of the United States and safeguard world peace.
    Today's rally in Wuhan took place around Jiefang Avenue Square, with rallies also held in various factories, schools, government offices, military units, and people's communes throughout the city. Starting at noon, demonstrators poured into the central venue, and angry crowds were everywhere in the streets and alleys.
    Leading Party and government officials of Hubei Province and Wuhan City, as well as responsible individuals from provincial and municipal democratic parties and people's organizations, participated in today's meeting. Also attending the meeting were Soviet and German Democratic Republic experts working in Wuhan, Australian guests visiting Wuhan, French travelers, Burmese journalists, Vietnamese, Korean, UAR, and Indonesian students in Wuhan, and returned overseas Chinese visiting Wuhan.
    Zhao Xinchu, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke at the meeting on behalf of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China. He said that the destruction of the Four-Power Summit Conference by imperialism has given the people of the world a profound education, making them unite more closely to carry out unremitting struggles against the aggressive policies of imperialism and to defend world peace. We have always advocated peaceful settlement of international disputes, but we never imagine that lasting world peace can be achieved solely through negotiations. World peace mainly relies on the struggle of the people of all countries. He said that the people of Hubei Province, together with the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, will develop the cause of socialist construction at a faster pace and contribute the greatest strength to defending lasting world peace.
    Tang Zhe, representative of the local organizations of various democratic parties, Li Zhi, Vice Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, Chen Kedong, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Federation of Trade Unions representing various people's organizations, Ma Xueli, a well-known labor model representing workers, and Li Maoshun, a labor model representing peasants, also spoke at the meeting. They pointed out that the gangster behavior of American imperialism precisely proves that it is surrounded by the people of the world, and its days are getting worse and worse. They called on people of all strata to be vigilant against the war conspiracies of American imperialism at all times and be ready to give the imperialist aggressors a devastating blow at any time.
    The people of Wuhan, with their glorious revolutionary tradition, had suffered long-term plunder and oppression from many imperialist countries such as the United States, Japan, Britain, France, and Germany before liberation. They are extremely angry at the American imperialist crime of deliberately invading the Soviet Union. Old workers who participated in the "February 7th" strike 37 years ago today used their personal experience of being humiliated by imperialism to educate the younger generation at the rally, telling them to always remember that imperialism is the mortal enemy of the people. Wang Zhihuai, an old "February 7th" worker who had been severely beaten by imperialist elements, said that imperialism bullies the weak and fears the strong. We must unite and fight it to the end. Jing Mingcai, a lieutenant who had served in the volunteer army and won the second-class merit in the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, participated in the demonstration today with righteous indignation. He said that American imperialism pretended to be peaceful on one hand and invaded the Soviet Union on the other, which is really shameless. He also said that the American devils are clamoring about the "policy of strength" everywhere, but in fact, they are a paper tiger. The Soviet Union shot down their U-2 spy plane, and we also beat the American aggressor troops so badly on the Korean battlefield that they could not lift their heads. All this shows that the people of socialist countries are not to be trifled with. The American imperialists should learn a lesson from these facts.
    The workers and peasants of Wuhan City, who have a deep affection for the Soviet people, expressed in unison that they would resolutely support the just stance of the Soviet government and were determined to fight to the end with the Soviet people against American imperialist aggression. The 100,000 workers who are building the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation with Soviet assistance shouted angrily at the rally: "People of the world unite, down with American imperialism!" and other slogans. Xiao Shujia, a well-known labor model of Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation who had served in the volunteer army and fiercely fought the American imperialist aggressor troops in Korea, said that the more American imperialism makes trouble, the more it shows that its life is not long. Commune members of the rural people's communes in the suburbs of Wuhan, who were working in the fields, also listened to the live broadcast of the Wuhan City mass rally today. Huang Wenguo, the battalion commander of the militia assault battalion of Guanshan Commune, said: "We must increase our vigilance a hundredfold. If American imperialism dares to launch a war, we will let it die without a burial place."

    Anti-American Fury Ignites the Mountain City
    Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, May 22nd: More than 1.5 million workers, students, urban people's commune members, government cadres, soldiers, militiamen, and people from all walks of life in Chongqing held unprecedented demonstrations and rallies in several places at the same time today, resolutely supporting the Soviet government's just stance against the American imperialist crime of aggression and angrily condemning American imperialism for sabotaging the Four-Power Summit Conference.
    Starting at noon today in the mountain city of Chongqing, angry demonstrators poured into various venues in a mighty stream. More than 80,000 people participated in the rally held at Datianwan Square in the urban area. Responsible cadres of the Chongqing Party and government, responsible individuals of various democratic parties and people's organizations all attended the meeting. Soviet experts and Romanian experts working in Chongqing also attended the meeting.
    Ren Baige, First Secretary of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke at the meeting. He first expressed his resolute support on behalf of the city's 4.4 million people for the Soviet government's just stance against American imperialist aggression, and angrily condemned the American imperialist crime of sabotaging the Four-Power Summit Conference. Ren Baige solemnly pointed out: "If American imperialism dares to launch a war of aggression, it will be sent to the grave by the people of the world." The speech was constantly interrupted by waves of applause and slogans from the masses. Smirnov, a representative of Soviet experts, also spoke at the meeting. He said: Our great friends, the Chinese people and the people of the countries of the socialist camp, unanimously support the just position of the Soviet Union. If imperialism dares to launch a war against the socialist camp, they will be fatally repulsed. Xiao Huaqing, representative of various democratic parties in Chongqing, Duan Daming, Vice Chairman of the Chongqing Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, Zhang Qi, representative of various people's organizations, Huang Rongchang, representative of workers, Zhou Zhida, representative of peasants, and others unanimously supported the Soviet government's just stance and severely condemned the American imperialist crime of sabotaging the Four-Power Summit Conference in their speeches.
    A massive demonstration was held after the meeting. Today, the fire of anti-Americanism has spread throughout the mountain city. In addition to the mass rally at Datianwan Square, more than one million workers, peasants, government cadres, school teachers and students, and urban people's commune members from the city's major factories and mines, universities and colleges, and six districts and three counties in the suburbs held mass rallies and demonstrations. Among today's mighty demonstration teams, many were demobilized veterans of the Volunteer Army who had fought against the American imperialist aggressor troops on the Korean battlefield. Lai Chengquan, a demobilized veteran of the Volunteer Army, came specially from dozens of miles outside the city to participate in the parade in the city today. Before liberation, the American imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek clique had set up a special agent concentration camp in Chongqing - the "Sino-American Cooperation Organization" - and killed a large number of revolutionary martyrs. Today, many family members of revolutionary martyrs whose relatives were killed by American and Chiang Kai-shek agents also participated in rallies and demonstrations. Liu Chengguo, the 66-year-old family member of a revolutionary martyr and director of the Welfare Printing Factory of Chaotianmen People's Commune, participated in the anti-American imperialist demonstration with the workers of the factory. She indignantly told the workers: "The American and Chiang Kai-shek agents killed my only son, Wang Youyu, on the eve of Chongqing's liberation. I will never forget this blood debt of American imperialism." (Photo attached)

    据新华社广州22日电　具有反帝爱国斗争光荣传统的广州市，今天有八十多万人分别举行集会和示威游行，坚决支持苏联政府对美帝国主义侵略和挑衅的严正立场，愤怒谴责美帝国主义破坏四国首脑会议。
    抗议美帝国主义无耻侵犯苏联和破坏四国首脑会议的汹涌澎湃的怒潮，今天席卷广州市的每一条街道。从中午开始，来自各工厂、学校、部队、机关和城市人民公社的人们，举着各种标语漫画和旗帜，走向集会的场所。中心会场越秀山体育场的里里外外，挤满了近八万多群众，口号声和激昂的歌声响彻云霄。

    群众以热烈的掌声欢迎苏联驻广州商务代表处处长古边柯夫讲话，他指出：连日来在中国和社会主义阵营其他国家所举行的支持苏联为反对美帝国主义侵略行为而采取的严正立场、反对美帝国主义破坏四国政府首脑会议的群众大会，证明了社会主义阵营各国牢不可破的团结一致。他说：敌人正在张牙舞爪，因此我们要加强警惕性，警觉地注视着帝国主义的一切阴谋，并准备随时给予侵略者以毁灭性的打击。
    接着，讲话的是各民主党派广东省、广州市地方组织代表萧隽英，中国人民保卫世界和平委员会广东省分会副主席郭棣活，广东省各人民团体代表陈能兴，工业劳动模范张汉明，农业劳动模范钟叙本等。他们指出，美国政府是威胁世界和平的罪魁祸首。他们表示中国人民永远和伟大的苏联人民站在一起，为反对美帝国主义侵略、保卫世界和平而坚决斗争到底。
    今天，广州市数十万工人、农民、部队、机关干部和市民们挥舞红旗，高举着巨幅标语、漫画牌，愤怒地走上大街举行了示威游行，充分显示出英雄的广州人民反对侵略的决心。由省、市工人、学生和机关干部组成的民兵队伍，拿着崭新的冲锋枪雄赳赳地参加了游行。被美帝国主义破坏和平的罪行所激怒的广州市工人，今天高举着标语，参加了示威游行。在金花公社的兴隆五金工厂集会上，先进生产者曾繁珍愤怒地说：“帝国主义企图掩盖他们的侵略的本质，装出了‘和平’姿态，实际上是为了准备新的侵略战争。我们热爱和平，但是丝毫不怕战争，美帝国主义胆敢把战争加在我们头上，毁灭的只是它们自己。”
    中国人民解放军驻广州陆海空军官兵今日在驻地分别举行集会，塔山守备英雄团官兵们在集会上一致愤怒地谴责美国对苏联的侵略，热烈支持赫鲁晓夫声明的严正立场。

    武汉三镇群情沸腾
    据新华社武汉22日电　武汉市今天有一百五十万人举行了规模空前的集会和示威，坚决支持苏联政府反对美帝国主义侵略的严正立场，谴责美帝国主义破坏四国首脑会议的罪行。人们决心和全国人民、苏联人民以及全世界人民一道，彻底粉碎美国的罪恶阴谋，保卫世界和平。
    武汉市今天以解放大道广场为中心举行集会，全市各工厂、学校、机关、部队和人民公社也都举行了集会。从中午开始，示威群众浩浩荡荡地涌向中心会场，大街小巷，到处是愤怒的人群。
    湖北省和武汉市党政领导人以及省、市各民主党派、各人民团体的负责人，参加了今天的大会。参加大会的还有在武汉工作的苏联和德意志民主共和国专家，在武汉访问的澳大利亚客人，法国旅行者，缅甸新闻工作者，在武汉的越南、朝鲜、阿联、印度尼西亚的留学生，和在武汉的回国观光华侨。
    中共湖北省委书记处书记赵辛初代表中共湖北省委在大会上讲话。他说，帝国主义破坏四国首脑会议，使全世界人民受到一次深刻的教育，使全世界人民更加紧密地团结起来，为反对帝国主义的侵略政策和保卫世界和平进行坚持不懈的斗争。我们一贯主张和平解决国际争端，但是我们从不幻想只靠谈判就能实现世界持久和平，世界和平主要依靠各国人民的斗争来取得，他说，湖北省人民和全国人民一道，在党中央和毛主席的领导下，将以更快的速度发展社会主义建设事业，为保卫世界持久和平贡献出最大的力量。

    有着光荣的革命传统的武汉人民，解放前曾经身受过美、日、英、法、德等许多帝国主义国家的长期掠夺和压迫。他们对美帝国主义蓄意侵略苏联的罪行极为愤怒。三十七年前参加“二七”大罢工的老工人，今天在集会上用受到帝国主义凌辱的亲身经历教育青年一代，要永远记住帝国主义是人民的死敌。饱受帝国主义分子鞭打的“二七”老工人王植槐说，帝国主义就是欺软怕硬的，我们一定要团结起来和它斗争到底。曾参加志愿军并在抗美援朝战争中立过二等战功的敬明才少尉，今天义愤填膺地参加示威游行。他说，美帝国主义一面假装和平，一面侵略苏联，真是厚颜无耻极了。他还说，美国鬼子到处叫嚣“实力政策”，事实上它是个纸老虎，苏联打下它的U—2型间谍飞机，我们在朝鲜战场也曾打得美国侵略军抬不起头来。这都说明社会主义国家的人民不是好惹的，美帝国主义者应该从这些事实中吸取教训。
    对苏联人民有着深厚感情的武汉市工农群众，同声表示要坚决支持苏联政府的严正立场，决心和苏联人民一道，为反对美帝国主义侵略而斗争到底。在苏联帮助下建设着武钢的十万工人，今天在集会上愤怒地高呼：“全世界人民团结起来，打倒美帝国主义！”等口号。武钢著名劳动模范、曾参加志愿军在朝鲜痛打过美帝国主义侵略军的萧树家说，美帝国主义越捣乱，越说明它的寿命不长了。正在田野里劳动的武汉郊区农村人民公社社员今天也收听了武汉市群众大会的实况广播。关山公社民兵突击营营长黄文国说：“我们要百倍提高警惕，美帝国主义敢发动战争，就叫它死无葬身之地。”
