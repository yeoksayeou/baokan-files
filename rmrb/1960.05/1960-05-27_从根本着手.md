Comprehensive technical transformation of railway sidings is another good way to tap the potential of railway transportation.

More than half of the goods transported by railways are loaded and unloaded on enterprise sidings. Before liberation, due to the limitations of capitalist private ownership and the anarchy of production in old cities, the enterprise sidings lacked scientific and rational overall planning, resulting in complex and irrational distribution of lines. Although newly built enterprises after liberation generally met the requirements of urban construction planning, they also had many uneconomical and unreasonable aspects due to lack of experience. The symptoms are that some sidings are very tight, while others are often idle; there are few cargo spaces and short loading and unloading lines, making it impossible for vehicles to be loaded and unloaded in trains; the routes within the factories are chaotic, often causing vehicle congestion. Therefore, it is an important matter for current railway transportation to make greater determination and take more effective measures to fundamentally eliminate the unreasonable phenomena in the distribution, use, and management of sidings.

The comprehensive transformation of sidings is also a major change in the relations of production in industrial enterprises. In the past, railways and coal mines had their own independent departments in terms of lines, locomotives, and vehicles, each with its own set of equipment, which caused waste of equipment and manpower and confusion in management. In addition, some lines that could have been "publicly used" continued to be "privately used" due to their respective administrations. These are incompatible with the development of productive forces. It is necessary to break the boundaries between roads and mines and between enterprises to carry out a comprehensive transformation. Heilongjiang Province completed the first phase of the railway siding transformation project in more than a month, increasing the number of lines in the province that can be loaded and unloaded in trains from 27 to 70. This is an example of the successful transformation of transportation lines in many industrial cities.

The transformation of railway sidings in industrial and mining enterprises must be planned in a unified manner and arranged comprehensively. In a region, roads and mines should be transformed together where possible; in public utilities, avoid creating "small stoves" and organize to change "private" to "public." Heilongjiang Province, without requiring state investment, comprehensively planned and transformed in stages. It met the needs of the transformation project by dismantling long lines to compensate for short ones and sharing transportation equipment such as steel rails and locomotives, while saving a batch of materials to support urban construction. These experiences and practices are worth promoting.

    从根本着手
    对铁路专用线进行全面的技术改造，是挖掘铁路运输潜力的又一个好办法。
    铁路运输的货物有一半以上是在企业专用线上装卸的。解放以前，老城市的企业专用线，由于资本主义私人占有和生产无政府状态的局限，根本没有科学的、合理的总体规划，以致线路错综复杂，分布极不合理。解放以后新建的企业，虽然总的说来适应城市建设规划的要求，但因为缺乏经验，也有许多不经济、不合理的地方。所以表现出来的症状，有的专用线非常紧张，有的就经常闲置；货位少、装卸线短，车辆不能成列装卸；厂内路线混乱，常常造成车辆的堵塞。因此，下更大的决心，采取更有力的措施，从根本上消除专用线分布、使用、管理等方面的不合理现象，就成为当前铁路运输的一件重要事情。
    对专用线路的全面改造，也是工业企业生产关系上的一大变革。过去铁路与煤矿在线路、机车、车辆等方面各自独立门户，各有一套，既造成了设备、人力的浪费，又造成了管理的混乱。此外，有些线路本来可以“公用”却因各自为政而继续“专用”。这些都是与生产力的发展不相适应的。必须打破这种路矿之间的界限、企业之间的界限，来一个全面的改造。黑龙江省在一个多月的时间中，完成了铁路专用线改造的第一期工程，使全省可以成列装卸的线路由二十七条增加到七十条。就是许多工业城市运输线路改造成功的一例。
    工矿企业铁路专用线路的改造，必须统筹规划，全面安排，在一个地区内，路矿能够合在一起改的，就合在一起改；在公用事业上，能够不开“小锅小灶”的就组织起来，变“专用”为“公用”。黑龙江省在不要国家投资的前提下，全面规划，分期改造，有关钢轨和机车等运输设备，通过拆长补短、互通有无等办法，满足了改造工程的需要，同时，节省出一批材料支援了城市建设。这些经验和作法，值得推广。
