Xinhua News Agency, 24th. U.S. imperialism is intensifying the creation of a tense situation in the Taiwan area.

According to Taiwan newspaper reports, American aggressors have recently intensified the expansion of the Zuoying naval port in Taiwan. At the so-called groundbreaking ceremony on May 12, James, Deputy Director of the Taiwan Branch of the U.S. International Cooperation Administration, clamored that the expansion of the Zuoying naval port was to "adapt to the needs of the U.S. Navy in Far East defense." American aggressors are also colluding with the Chiang Kai-shek clique to expand the Lanyu military airport and Hualien Port. Haraldson, Director of the Taiwan Branch of the U.S. International Cooperation Administration, clamored at the groundbreaking ceremony of the port: "Once a war breaks out, it can be used for giant warships to enter and exit." The United States has recently established an arsenal in Taiwan to manufacture shells, and the first batch of equipment has been shipped from the United States to Keelung.

The first batch of F-104 jet fighters supplied by U.S. imperialism to the Chiang Kai-shek clique was shipped from Japan to Taiwan on May 17. On this day, U.S. Air Force Secretary Sharp openly threatened that the United States' arming of the Chiang Kai-shek clique's air force with new jet fighters was a "formidable deterrent" to "deal with the Communists." On the afternoon of the 16th, U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group Commander to Taiwan, Doan, on behalf of the U.S. government, handed over another transport ship to the Chiang Kai-shek navy at the Zuoying naval base in Taiwan, incorporating it into the battle sequence. This 1,400-ton "USS Kling Smith", a fast transport ship, has now been renamed "Tianshan" by the Chiang army.

Taiwan newspapers say that the United States is drafting a new military "aid" to the Chiang Kai-shek clique for 1961, and the news says: "The focus may be on the allocation of new weapons." The newspaper said that in the past ten years, the U.S. imperialists' military assistance to the Chiang Kai-shek clique has averaged about 200 million U.S. dollars per year. The United States has used this money to tie the Chiang Kai-shek clique tightly to the U.S. chariot and let it be manipulated.

In the past month or so, U.S. generals and espionage chiefs have been continuously carrying out war conspiracy activities in Taiwan. These include U.S. Air Force Secretary Sharp, U.S. Department of Defense Brigadier General Intelligence Officer Duke, U.S. Naval Operations Assistant Chief of Staff in charge of intelligence Frost, U.S. Western Sea Frontier District Commander Kivette, and U.S. Pacific Air Force Logistics Force Commander Porter, etc. The U.S. State Department's "Military Economic Assistance Visiting Group" and the U.S. Department of Defense's "Joint Security Defense Group" also successively visited military bases of the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan in May. It is worth noting that the seven U.S. officials of the U.S. State Department's "Military Economic Assistance Visiting Group" went to Jinmen Island on May 12 to carry out conspiracy activities and peeped at the situation on the mainland of Fujian. In addition, Botner, a executioner who served as the commander of the "Geoje Island Prisoner of War Camp" in the Korean War, also went to Jinmen on May 2. He is now the commander of the U.S. Army Military Police.

The U.S. Taiwan Defense Command has also recently instructed the Chiang army to conduct provocative military exercises in succession. Among them are the so-called Army "Inland Combat Exercise", Air Force "Mobilization Exercise", and Army and Air Force "Mountain Real-Soldier Confrontation Exercise", creating a tense atmosphere. U.S. news agencies also revealed that the U.S. Navy authorities announced that on May 2, five U.S. warships sailed from the coast of California to the Far East to join the battle sequence of the U.S. Seventh Fleet. The commander of this fleet, Griffin, issued war cries in Taipei, saying that the U.S. troops stationed in Taiwan and the Chiang Kai-shek army were "ready to go at any time."

    美帝加紧制造紧张局势
    在台湾扩建军用海港机场和兵工厂
    战争贩子特务头子不断到台湾活动
    新华社24日讯　美帝国主义正在台湾地区加紧制造紧张局势。
    据台湾报纸消息，美国侵略者最近在台湾加紧扩建左营海军军港，在5月12日的所谓开工典礼会上，美国国际合作总署台湾分署副署长詹姆斯叫嚣说，扩建左营军港是为了“适应美国海军在远东防务上的需要”。美国侵略人员还勾结蒋介石集团，正在扩建兰屿军用机场和花莲港。美国国际合作总署台湾分署署长哈拉德森在该港奠基典礼上叫嚣说：“一旦战争爆发时，可供巨型战舰进出之用。”美国最近在台湾筹建一个制造炮弹的兵工厂，第一批设备已由美国运到基隆。
    美帝国主义供给蒋介石集团的F—104型喷气战斗机，第一批已在5月17日由日本运到台湾。在这一天，美国空军部长夏普公然威胁说，美国以新式喷气战斗机武装蒋介石集团空军，是“对付共产党”的“可畏的威慑力量”。16日下午，美国驻台湾军事援助顾问团团长窦恩，代表美国政府在台湾左营海军基地又把一艘运输舰交给蒋介石海军，编入战斗序列。这艘一千四百吨的“克林史密斯号”快速运输舰，现在由蒋军改名为“天山号”。
    台湾报纸说，美国正在拟订给蒋介石集团1961年度新的军事“援助”，消息说：“重点可能在新武器的拨援”。报纸说，美帝国主义在过去十年中，对蒋介石集团的军事援助平均每年约为二亿美元，美国用这笔钱把蒋介石集团紧紧地绑在美国战车上，听其摆布。
    最近一个多月，美国的将军们和特务头子接连不断地到台湾进行战争阴谋活动。其中包括美国空军部长夏普、美国国防部准将情报官员杜克、美国负责情报的海军作战助理参谋长弗罗斯特、美国西海疆军区司令基维德、美国太平洋地区空军后勤部队司令波特尔等。美国国务院“军经援访问小组”和美国国防部“共同安全防务小组”也在5月间先后到台湾视察美国和蒋介石集团的军事基地。值得注意的是，美国国务院“军经援访问小组”的七名美国官员在5月12日曾到金门岛上进行阴谋活动，并且窥视我福建大陆情况。另外一个曾在侵略朝鲜战争中任“巨济岛战俘营”司令的刽子手博特讷，也在5月2日前往金门活动，他现在是美国陆军宪兵司令。
    侵台美军司令部最近还指使蒋军连续举行挑衅性的军事演习。其中有所谓陆军“内陆作战演习”、空军“动员演习”、陆空军“山地实兵对抗演习”等，制造紧张气氛。美国通讯社还透露，美国海军当局宣布，在5月2日由五艘美国军舰从加利福尼亚海岸开往远东，加入美国第七舰队的战斗行列。这个舰队的司令格里芬曾在台北市发出战争叫嚣说，侵台美军和蒋介石军队“随时准备就绪待令出动。”
