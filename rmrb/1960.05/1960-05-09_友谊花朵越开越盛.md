    The Flowers of Friendship Bloom More Luxuriantly
    Czechoslovakia Bao Ri Jia
    Not long ago I visited an agricultural cooperative. Eleven years ago I participated in the establishment of this cooperative, located in the village of Činěves, about sixty kilometers from Prague. The people here live very happily. They say, "Under no circumstances would any of us want to return to individual farming. Our cooperative is advancing rapidly. Our members have given up their last piece of private land and are even unwilling to raise livestock privately. People are starting to live like city dwellers!"
    While visiting this cooperative, I once again recalled the path Czechoslovakia has taken in the last fifteen years. Never in our history have there been such enormous social and economic changes as have occurred in the last fifteen years. In 1945, we began construction on the ruins left to us by German fascism. Today, we celebrate the fifteenth anniversary of our liberation with confidence and joy.
    Naturally, in these days, we want to look around us, greet our friends, and hope that they share our joy. The People's Republic of China, like the Soviet Union, is our closest and most respected friend. In our country and in China, power is in the hands of the people, and our people hope to build a communist society in our generation. The powerful socialist country—the Soviet Union—connects our two countries, and we live on one continent, on the socialist continent.
    I was fortunate enough to visit the People's Republic of China. I stayed in China for a month. This is one of the most memorable events of my life. I will never forget those days. I saw firsthand the beauty and strength of China, and I felt the friendship of China.
    What a unique world! The scenery of China, the marvelous mountains, the boundless plains, the magnificent rivers, the park-like, meticulously cultivated fields, and China's amazing architectural art, the works of Chinese artists, sculptors, and writers, etc. In addition to the visible beautiful scenery, there are the supreme moral qualities of the Chinese people, their sense of justice and humanitarian spirit.
    Today, the strength of the People's China is already very great. Of course, the noble qualities of the Chinese people are first and foremost the source of this strength; their selflessness, discipline, and loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party are unparalleled. In recent years, China's material strength has also grown dramatically. New industrial combines with the most modern technology are constantly emerging, huge dams and irrigation systems are being built, the country is gradually being electrified, natural wealth is being exploited, and agricultural technology is constantly improving. Our country is also helping the People's Republic of China in industrial construction. At the same time, we receive from China, first of all, food and raw materials. As early as 1950, we signed the first trade agreement between our two countries. From then until now, the trade exchange volume has increased nearly sevenfold. In trade with the People's Republic of China, our country is one of the leading countries. At the same time, the commodities China supplies us play an increasingly important role in the economic life of Czechoslovakia.
    Scientific and technological cooperation also occupies a very important place in our friendly relations. As early as 1953, the first agreement in this regard was signed. Since then, the two countries have exchanged a great deal of the latest information and technical documents. For example, Czechoslovakian technicians have helped produce machine tools, diesel engines, "Sigma" water pumps, etc. in China. Chinese experts are also helping us in the production of silk, porcelain, paper, dyes, and paints. This kind of friendship is most understandable.
    During our visit to China, we were often surprised by the fact that so many people, so comprehensively, understood our country; our people and their skilled technology were highly respected. We are very pleased that many of our books have been translated into Chinese and published in China, and that many more works will be published.
    We are deeply convinced that the flowers of our friendship will bloom more luxuriantly. (Attached image)

    友谊花朵越开越盛
    捷克斯洛伐克　鲍·日加
    不久前我参观了一个农业合作社，十一年前我参加过这个社的建社工作，这个合作社位于离布拉格约六十公里的契涅维斯村。这里的人们生活得很幸福。他们说：“在任何条件下我们中间没有一个人想恢复个体经济。我们合作社在飞快地前进。我们的社员放弃了最后一块自留地，甚至都不愿意私人饲养牲畜。人们开始像城市居民那样生活！”
    在参观这个合作社的时候，我再一次回想起捷克斯洛伐克在最近十五年所走过的道路。在我国历史上从来没有过像最近十五年来在社会和经济方面所发生的这么巨大的变化。1945年我们在德国法西斯遗留给我们的废墟上开始了建设。今天我们信心百倍、欢欣鼓舞地隆重庆祝我国解放十五周年。
    很自然，在这些日子里我们要环顾我们的四周，向自己的朋友们致意，并希望他们和我们共同欢乐。中华人民共和国和苏联一样，是我们最亲密、最尊敬的朋友。在我国和中国，政权掌握在人民手中，我们的人民希望在我们这一辈就建成共产主义社会。强大的社会主义国家——苏联把我们两国联系在一起，我们生活在一个大陆上，生活在社会主义的大陆上。
    我很幸运访问了中华人民共和国。我在中国逗留了一个月。这是我生活中印象最深的一件事。我永远不会忘记那些日子。我亲眼看到中国的美丽和中国的力量，我感受到了中国的友情。
    多么独特的世界啊！中国的景色，奇妙的山峦、无边的平原、宏伟的江河，像公园一样的精耕细作的田野，以及中国惊人的建筑艺术，中国艺术家、雕刻家和作家的作品等。除了看得见的美丽的风景外，还有中国人民至高无上的道德品质，他们的正义感和人道精神。
    今天，人民中国的力量已经非常强大。当然，中国人民高贵的品质首先就是这一力量的源泉；他们的忘我精神、纪律性和对中国共产党的忠诚是无可比拟的。最近几年来中国的物质力量也急剧地增长。拥有最现代化技术的新的工业联合企业不断出现，建设着巨大的堤坝和灌溉系统、国家正在逐步实现电气化、自然财富正在开采、农业技术也在不断改善。在工业建设方面我国也在帮助中华人民共和国。同时我们从中国得到了，首先是粮食和原料。还在1950年，我们两国之间就签订了第一个贸易协定。从那时起到现在，贸易交换额增加了将近七倍。在同中华人民共和国进行的贸易方面，我国居于头几位的国家之一。同时，中国供给我们的商品在捷克斯洛伐克的经济生活中也起着越来越重要的作用。
    科学技术合作也在我们的友好关系中占着很重要的地位。还在1953年就签订了第一个这方面的协定。从那时起两国交换了许多最新的资料和技术文献。例如，捷克斯洛伐克的技术人员在中国帮助生产了工作母机、柴油发动机、“西格马”抽水机等等。中国的专家也在丝绸、瓷器、造纸、染料和漆的生产等方面帮助我们。这种友谊最能使人理解。
    在中国访问期间，我们经常感到惊奇的是：中国劳动人民中间有这么多人，这么全面地了解我们的国家；我国人民和他们的熟练的技术受到了很大的尊重。我们的很多书籍已译成中文在中国出版，并且还有很多作品将要出版，这使我们非常高兴。
    我们深信，我们友谊的花朵越开越盛。（附图片）
