Xinhua News Agency, May 12th news, Washington: U.S. President Eisenhower admitted in a press conference on the 11th that sending aircraft to intrude into Soviet airspace for espionage activities was done on his instructions.

In a statement he read, Eisenhower clamored about the "necessity of the United States engaging in intelligence-gathering activities" in other countries. He openly said in the tone of an imperialist, "We must know the military forces and preparedness of the world, especially those countries capable of launching large-scale surprise attacks." Based on robber logic, he instead accused, "The Soviet Union worships secrecy and concealment," claiming that this is "the main reason for today's international tension and unease," and that "Soviet secrecy makes this (American) activity indispensable." Eisenhower unabashedly said, "Since I took office, I have issued instructions to collect" what the United States considers "necessary intelligence by all practically feasible means."

Eisenhower also fancifully demanded that the Soviet Union accept the so-called "open skies" proposal that would allow the United States to freely collect military intelligence from the air. He said he would raise this proposal again at the Paris Four-Power Summit.

Eisenhower also shamelessly talked about the "special secret nature" of intelligence-gathering activities in the statement. He attempted to use these words to cover up the embarrassing situation of the U.S. government being exposed for lying in this incident. He also used what he called "deceptive" tactics, trying to downplay the impact of the Soviet Union's military prowess, saying that "there is good reason to believe that the plane was not shot down at high altitude."

Eisenhower also wouldn't allow the person who caught the thief to shout that there was a thief. He clamored that this incident "has been greatly exploited in propaganda." In order to escape the embarrassing situation, he tried to portray this act of aggression, which created international tension, as an insignificant matter, saying, "To give such emphasis to the flight of an unarmed, non-military aircraft can only reflect a superstition about secrecy." He also said, "We must not allow ourselves to be diverted from the real problems of our time by an incident or a symptom of today's world situation."

Eisenhower also feigned a stance, saying, "The real issues are those we will discuss at the summit meeting—disarmament, seeking solutions to the problems of Germany and Berlin, the whole issue of East-West relations, including reducing secrecy and suspicion. Frankly, I am hopeful that progress can be made on these major issues." He also said shamelessly, "That's what we mean when we say 'working for peace.'"

In answering questions, Eisenhower also had to admit: "To my knowledge, (the Soviet Union) has never had such flights over the United States." This undoubtedly gave a resounding slap in the face to U.S. government officials (including Secretary of State Herter) who have been trying to defend the American aggression by counter-attacking the Soviet Union.

At the press conference, Eisenhower also reaffirmed the U.S. imperialist position of interfering in China's internal affairs and obstructing the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan and the coastal islands. He clamored that the United States "must participate" in "defending Formosa." Regarding Quemoy and Matsu, he said that for the Chiang Kai-shek group, "any action to give up these islands means complete surrender, a depressing surrender. So this is a factor that anyone who might have to make a decision in the future must consider when talking about giving up these islands."

In answering questions, Eisenhower also said that he would not change his plan to visit the Soviet Union.

    艾森豪威尔强盗面目毕露
    承认侵苏美机是他指示去收集军事情报的
    重申干涉中国内政阻挠我解放台湾的立场
    新华社12日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔11日在记者招待会上承认，派遣飞机侵入苏联领空从事间谍活动是根据他的指示做的。
    艾森豪威尔在宣读的声明中叫嚣美国侵入别国“从事搜集情报活动的必要性”。他公开以帝国主义者的口吻说，“我们必须知道全世界的、特别是那些有能力发动大规模突袭的国家的军事部队和准备情况”。他根据强盗逻辑反而指责，“苏联崇拜保密和隐藏”，说什么这是“今天产生国际紧张局势和不安的主要原因”，“苏联的保密使得（美国）这种活动必不可少”。艾森豪威尔直认不讳地说，“自从我开始执政以来，我就曾发出指示，用一切实际可行的办法搜集”美国认为“必需的情报”。
    艾森豪威尔还异想天开地要苏联接受使美国可以自由从空中搜集军事情报的所谓“开放天空”建议。他说，他将在巴黎四国政府首脑会议上再次提出这一建议。
    艾森豪威尔还在声明中无耻地大谈搜集情报活动的“特殊的秘密性质”。他企图用这些话来遮盖美国政府在这一事件上撒了谎被戳穿的狼狈丑态。他并使用了他所说的“使人迷惑”的手法，力图降低苏联的军事威力所造成的影响，说什么“很有理由可以认为这架飞机不是在高空被击落的”。
    艾森豪威尔还不准捉住了贼的人叫喊有贼。他叫嚷说这次事件“被人们在宣传上大肆利用了”。为了摆脱狼狈处境，他力图把这件制造世界紧张局势的侵略事件说做是无所谓的小事情，他说，“对于一架没有武装的非军事飞机的飞行竟给予如此强调，这只能反映出对保密的迷信”。他还说，“绝不能由于一次事件或今天世界局势的一种症兆而转移我们对当代真正问题的注意力”。
    艾森豪威尔还故作姿态地说，“真正的问题是我们将在最高级会议上讨论的问题——裁军、谋求解决德国和柏林问题的办法，整个东西方关系问题，其中包括减少保密和猜疑。坦白地说，我对这些重大问题可能取得进展是抱有希望的。”他还大言不惭地说，“这就是我们说的‘为和平而努力’这句话的意义。”
    艾森豪威尔在回答问题时也不得不承认：“就我所知，（苏联）在美国上空从未有过这种飞行”。这无疑给了这些时候来竭力用反噬苏联来为美国侵略行动辩解的美国政府官员们（包括国务卿赫脱）一记响亮的耳光。
    艾森豪威尔在记者招待会上还重申美国干涉中国内政、阻挠中国人民解放台湾和沿海岛屿的帝国主义立场。他叫嚷说，美国“必须参加”“保卫福摩萨”。关于金门和马祖，他说，对蒋介石集团来说，“任何放弃这些岛屿的行动意味着完全的投降，沮丧的投降。所以这是（美国）将来可能要作出决定的任何人在谈到放弃这些岛屿时必须考虑的一个因素。”
    艾森豪威尔还在回答问题中说，他将不改变访问苏联的计划。
