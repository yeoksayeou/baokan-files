Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 2nd. Vice Premier He Long of the State Council held a banquet tonight to warmly welcome the delegation of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, led by Vice Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs Krim Belkacem. At the banquet, Vice Premier He Long, on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, solemnly stated that the 650 million Chinese people firmly support the Algerian people's national liberation struggle to the end.

In his speech at the banquet, Vice Premier Krim Belkacem expressed the Algerian people's firm will to oppose colonialism. He said: "The Algerian people are determined to use weapons to achieve complete liberation from colonial rule." "We are determined to fight until we achieve our independence. We believe that we will definitely win the final victory."

Chairman Zhu De attended the banquet.

The Algerian guests present at the banquet included: Minister of Armaments and Liaison Boussouf Abdelhafid, Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs Francis Ahmed, Deputy Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Belehoucein M’Barek, Advisors Djawi Mohamed, Benabdelmoumen Ali, Rouchdi Halim, Hamidi Hassan Kamel, Hafid Karim, Benhabyles Abdelmalek, News Commissioner Demaghlatorus Rabah, and Attaché of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ahamani Abdelaziz.

Vice Premier He Long spoke at the beginning of the banquet (full text on page 4). He said that the Chinese people have always followed the heroic struggle of the Algerian people with admiration. For more than five years, the heroic Algerian people have persistently carried out armed struggle under extremely difficult conditions, winning a series of victories and liberating large areas of land.

In his speech, Vice Premier He Long condemned French imperialism for stepping up armed suppression and engaging in political conspiracies in order to salvage its colonial rule in Algeria, which was already on the verge of collapse. He also sternly condemned US imperialism for vigorously supporting France's political conspiracies and armed suppression of the Algerian people, while at the same time plotting to interfere in Algerian affairs and replace the position of French colonial rule.

Vice Premier He Long pointed out that the heroic struggle of the Algerian people has not only tied down the main force of the French colonial army, providing strong support to other African nations striving for independence from French colonial oppression, but has also set a brilliant example for the cause of national liberation in Africa and the world, encouraging their struggles.

Vice Premier He Long said that now, the vast African continent, under the call of the heroic Algerian people, has been involved in the tide of struggle against imperialism and colonialism. The imperialist colonial system in Africa is in the process of disintegration. He expressed that the Chinese people will always stand with the African people and fight imperialism and colonialism to the end.

Vice Premier He Long said that the friendship between the Chinese people and the Algerian people has a deep foundation, and the common cause of opposing imperialism closely links us together. On behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, let me solemnly express to the delegation of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria that the 650 million Chinese people resolutely support the Algerian people's national liberation struggle to the end.

Vice Premier Krim Belkacem then spoke (full text on page 4). He said that for more than a hundred years, the Algerian people have been fighting to restore independence. They are fighting against their enemies, who are also the common enemies of the Chinese people and the Asian and African people, and fighting to realize common ideals. The hundred-year struggle of the Algerian people has entered a decisive stage for five and a half years. This is a revolutionary war that is integrated with the broad movement for national independence, which has enabled many countries to achieve independence.

Vice Premier Krim Belkacem said that for five and a half years, the Algerian people have been undergoing severe tests. French colonialists have launched a frenzied war against the just cause of the Algerian people, using various barbarous methods of colonial conquerors. But the Algerian people have not been intimidated, and they are waging an uncompromising and tenacious struggle. Our National Liberation Army has the best sons and daughters of Algeria, and they are defeating the powerful colonial army.

Vice Premier Krim Belkacem pointed out that today, without the help of the North Atlantic imperialist alliance, or more precisely, without the help of the US ruling clique, French colonialists would not be able to continue the Algerian war. He strongly condemned US imperialism and French colonialists for colluding with each other to defeat the Algerian revolution. He pointed out that General de Gaulle's proposal on self-determination is a neo-colonialist strategy and a hypocritical tactic, attempting to deceive international public opinion.

Speaking of the relationship between the struggle for national independence and the defense of world peace, he said that the easing of the international situation, the consolidation of world peace, and the independence of all countries are directly related. As long as colonialism exists, as long as the war continues in Algeria, world peace will still be threatened. The Algerian people's struggle for independence helps to weaken imperialism and colonialism and thwart the forces of war.

He said: The Chinese revolution, which thoroughly defeated imperialism, has strengthened the anti-colonialist camp. The Chinese revolution is a model, and it has made a historic contribution to the liberation of the oppressed people. The Algerian people are particularly proud of the friendship of the great Chinese people.

After Vice Premier He Long and Vice Premier Krim Belkacem spoke, the band played the national anthems of Algeria and China respectively. The speeches of the two vice premiers were warmly applauded by the audience.

The head of the diplomatic corps in Beijing, Afghan Ambassador to China Samad, proposed a toast to the victory, freedom, and independence of the Algerian people.

Present at the banquet were: Vice Premier of the State Council and Chief of General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army General Luo Ruiqing, Vice Premier of the State Council Xi Zhongxun, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Shen Junru, Chen Shutong, and Cheng Qian, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Burhan, Vice Chairmen of the National Defense Council Zhang Zhizhong and Fu Zuoyi, Chairman of the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity Liao Chengzhi, Minister of Foreign Trade Ye Jizhuang, and Vice Ministers of Foreign Affairs Luo Guibo and Ji Pengfei. Also present at the banquet were heads of various government departments, democratic parties, and people's organizations, senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, leaders of Beijing Municipality, and people from all walks of life in the capital. Mr. Habib, Chairman of the Democratic Union of French Somaliland and former Prime Minister, members of the Algerian trade union delegation, youth delegation, and student delegation, as well as foreign guests from some African countries and regions, and diplomatic envoys and diplomatic officials from various countries in China were also invited to attend the banquet.

    克里姆·贝勒卡塞姆副总理在宴会上讲话，表达了阿尔及利亚人民反对殖民主义的坚定意志。他说：“阿尔及利亚人民决心用武器来争取从殖民统治下获得彻底解放”，“我们决心战斗，直到获得我们的独立。我们相信，我们一定能够赢得最后的胜利”。
    朱德委员长出席了宴会。
    出席宴会的阿尔及利亚贵宾有：军备和联络部长布苏夫·阿卜杜勒哈菲德，财政和经济事务部长弗朗西斯·艾哈迈德，外交部副秘书长贝勒侯赛因·马卜鲁克，顾问贾维·穆罕默德，本阿卜杜勒穆迈迈·阿里，鲁什迪·哈利姆，哈米迪·哈桑·卡迈勒，哈菲德·卡里姆，本哈比莱斯·阿卜杜勒马利克，新闻专员德马格拉特鲁斯·拉比，外交部随员阿哈马尼·阿卜杜勒阿齐兹。
    贺龙副总理在宴会开始时讲话（全文见第四版）。他说，中国人民一向怀着敬佩的心情关注着阿尔及利亚人民的英勇斗争。五年多来，英勇的阿尔及利亚人民在极端困难的条件下，顽强地坚持着武装斗争，赢得了一系列的胜利，解放了大片的国土。
    贺龙副总理在讲话中谴责法国帝国主义为了挽回它在阿尔及利亚大势已去的殖民统治，一方面加紧武装镇压，一方面玩弄政治阴谋。他并且严厉谴责美帝国主义一方面大力支持法国的政治阴谋和对阿尔及利亚人民的武装镇压，一方面阴谋插手阿尔及利亚的事务，取代法国殖民统治的地位。
    贺龙副总理指出：阿尔及利亚人民的英勇斗争，不仅拖住了法国殖民军队的主力，给了非洲其他从法国殖民主义压迫下争取独立的民族以有力的支持，而且为全非洲和全世界争取民族解放的事业树立了光辉的榜样，鼓舞了他们的斗争。
    贺龙副总理说：现在，广大的非洲大陆，在英勇的阿尔及利亚人民的号召之下，都卷入了反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义的斗争浪潮。帝国主义在非洲的殖民体系正处在土崩瓦解的过程。他表示，中国人民始终不渝地同非洲人民站在一起，为反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义斗争到底。
    贺龙副总理说：中国人民和阿尔及利亚人民的友谊有深厚的基础，反对帝国主义的共同事业把我们紧密地联结在一起。让我代表中国政府和中国人民，向阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团庄严地表示，六亿五千万中国人民对阿尔及利亚人民民族解放斗争坚决支持到底。
    克里姆·贝勒卡塞姆副总理接着讲话（全文见第四版）。他说：一百多年来，阿尔及利亚人民，一直进行着恢复独立的斗争。他们在为反对自己的敌人，也是中国人民和亚非人民共同的敌人而战斗。为实现共同的理想而斗争。阿尔及利亚人民所进行的百年斗争，五年半以来，已进入了决定性的阶段。这是一场革命战争，它同争取民族独立的广泛运动融合在一起，这个运动已使许多国家取得了独立。
    克里姆·贝勒卡塞姆副总理说：五年半以来，阿尔及利亚人民经历着严重的考验。法国殖民主义者对阿尔及利亚人民的正义事业展开了疯狂的战争，使用了殖民征服者的各种野蛮手段。但是阿尔及利亚人民并没有被吓倒，他们正在进行不调和的顽强斗争。我们的民族解放军拥有阿尔及利亚最优秀的儿女，他们正在挫败强大的殖民军队。
    克里姆·贝勒卡塞姆副总理指出：今天，如果没有北大西洋帝国主义联盟的帮助，更确切地说，如果没有美国统治集团的帮助，法国殖民者是不可能继续进行阿尔及利亚战争的。他强烈谴责美帝国主义和法国殖民主义者正在互相勾结，要击败阿尔及利亚的革命。他指出：戴高乐将军提出的关于自决的建议，是新殖民主义的战略和口是心非的手法，是企图欺骗国际舆论。
    讲到争取民族独立和保卫世界和平的关系时，他说：国际局势的缓和，世界和平的巩固，和各国人民的独立有着直接的联系。只要殖民主义还存在，只要战争还在阿尔及利亚继续进行，世界和平就仍然受到威胁。阿尔及利亚人民争取独立的斗争，有助于削弱帝国主义和殖民主义，和挫败战争力量。
    他说：彻底战胜了帝国主义的中国革命壮大了反殖民主义阵营。中国革命是一个典范，它给被压迫人民的解放作出了历史性的贡献。阿尔及利亚人民特别为伟大的中国人民的友谊而感到骄傲。
    贺龙副总理和克里姆·贝勒卡塞姆副总理讲话后，乐队分别奏阿尔及利亚和中国的国歌。两位副总理的讲话，受到了全场热烈的鼓掌欢迎。
