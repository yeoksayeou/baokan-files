Early Start and Manage Early Rice Well

Rice is the main grain crop in southern China, and the early rice planting area accounts for about one-third of the total rice area. In provinces such as Guangdong, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang, the early rice area accounts for about half of the rice area. Managing early rice well and striving for a bumper harvest of early rice is a key to completing this year's national grain crop production increase plan. Now, except for a few areas that are still rushing to plant and replant due to natural disasters, most provinces and regions have completed or exceeded their early rice transplanting plans. The current urgent task is to advance on the momentum and immediately launch a climax of comprehensively managing and managing early rice well.

Early rice is transplanted in early spring and matures around the "Major Heat" solar term, with a growing period of only over a hundred days in the paddy field. In these short hundred days, it has to pass through stages such as greening, tillering, heading, and grain filling. The central link in managing early rice is to take the initiative and strive for an "early" start, achieving "one early leading to a hundred earlies." Early greening leads to early tillering, early tillering leads to early heading, and early heading leads to early grain filling and early maturity. Early maturity leads to increased yield per unit area. Last year, Hengyang Prefecture in Hunan Province conducted a comprehensive survey on the effectiveness of early rice field management. The survey showed that early rice that was fertilized with germination fertilizer immediately after transplanting matured six days earlier than early rice that was fertilized seven days after transplanting, yielding more than 140 jin of rice per mu. It can be seen that early management is much better than late management.

The timing of early rice transplanting is often limited by natural conditions (such as temperature). However, management after transplanting is not subject to any restrictions and should be done as early as possible. In the past, people would wait for the rice seedlings to naturally green before managing them. This habit was formed in the era of small-scale peasant economy, when labor was not organized and the level of production was very low. Since cooperation, especially since the establishment of communes, due to changes in production relations and improvements in production conditions, the experience of early management, early maturity, and high yield of early rice has been gradually created. This year, some areas have further implemented "managing while transplanting" and "putting down the rice transplanter and picking up the weeding rake" in early rice production, accurately grasping the "early" aspect of managing early rice. Especially this spring, the temperature in some areas of the south was lower, and although rice seedlings were cultivated earlier than in previous years, transplanting was later than in previous years; some seedlings were transplanted earlier, but greening was very slow. For such seedlings, it is even more necessary to manage them early to overcome the adverse climate effects of the previous stage. The Chengjiao People's Commune in Jiang'an County, Sichuan Province, had more than 200 mu of early rice that withered due to low temperature attacks. The commune's rice professional team dealt with it in a timely manner and made every effort to rescue it, and the seedlings sprouted new leaves in four or five days. This proactive spirit of seizing crops from the jaws of natural disasters is worth learning from.

The field management of early rice should not only be early but also meticulous. Early rice field management includes fertilization, weeding, irrigation, drying the field, and preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests. In recent years, the techniques of irrigation, fertilization, and drying the field have greatly developed in many early rice areas. Their basic spirit is to further promote early maturity and strive for high yields of early rice. This year, some areas have created experience in eliminating or shortening the greening period of seedlings in the fight against natural disasters. Seriously summarizing and promoting these experiences of early maturity and high yield will definitely enable us to manage early rice better.

Strengthening early rice management as early as possible has a decisive effect on increasing early rice production and also has a great effect on increasing late rice production. In double-cropping rice areas, early rice and late rice are continuously harvested and planted. Early harvesting of early rice allows for early transplanting of late rice. The earlier late rice is transplanted, the higher the yield. "Late rice should not be planted after autumn, or nine out of ten will fail." Early maturity and early harvesting of early rice enable early transplanting and early management of late rice. In order to strive for a bumper harvest of rice, it is necessary to unswervingly implement the spirit of "one early leading to a hundred earlies" throughout the entire management process from early rice to late rice.

### 早动手管好早稻

    早动手管好早稻
    水稻是我国南方的主要粮食作物，早稻种植面积约为水稻总面积的三分之一；广东、湖南、江西、浙江等省早稻面积更占水稻面积的一半左右。管好早稻，争取早稻大丰收，是完成今年全国粮食作物增产计划的一个关键。现在，除了个别地区由于遭受自然灾害还在抢插、补插外，绝大部分省、区都已完成或超额完成了早稻插秧计划。当前的迫切任务是乘胜前进，立即掀起一个全面早管、管好早稻的高潮。
    早稻在早春插秧，“大暑”前后成熟，在本田里的生长期只有一百多天。在这短短的一百多天中，要过返青、分蘖、抽穗、灌浆等关。管理早稻的中心一环是掌握主动，争取一个“早”字，做到“一早百早”。早返青才能早分蘖，早分蘖才能早抽穗，早抽穗才能早灌浆、早成熟。熟得早，单位产量才能提高。湖南衡阳专区去年曾就早稻田间管理的实效，作过一次全面的调查。调查表明：插秧后就跟着施安兜肥的早稻，比插秧后七天才施安兜肥的早熟六天，每亩多收稻谷一百四十多斤。可见，早管理比晚管理要强得多。
    早稻什么时候插秧，常常受自然条件（如气温）的限制。插秧以后的管理，却不受什么限制，越早越好。过去人们插上早稻，总是等禾苗自然返青后再进行管理。这种习惯是在小农经济时代，劳动没有组织，生产水平很低的条件下形成的。合作化以来，特别是公社化以来，由于生产关系的变化，生产条件的改善，逐步创造了早稻早管、早熟、丰产的经验。今年有些地区在早稻生产上进一步实行“边插边管”，“收起插秧机，拿起耘禾耙”，准确地抓住了管理早稻的“早”字。特别是今春南方部分地区气温较低，育秧虽比往年早，插秧却比往年迟；有的插秧比较早，禾苗返青却很慢。对于这样的禾苗，更应该及早管理，克服前一阶段所受不良气候的影响。四川省江安县城郊人民公社有二百多亩早稻遭受低温袭击而枯萎了。公社的水稻专业组及时处理，全力抢救，四、五天禾苗就吐出新叶。这种从自然灾害的虎口中抢夺庄稼的主动精神值得学习。
    早稻的田间管理，不仅要管得早，还要管得细。早稻田间管理包括追肥、中耕、灌溉、晒田和防治病虫害等项目。近年来许多早稻区的灌溉、追肥、晒田技术都有很大的发展。它们的基本精神就是进一步促进早稻早熟，争取早稻高产。今年部分地区在对自然灾害作斗争中，又创造了消灭或缩短禾苗返青期的经验。认真总结和推广这些早熟高产经验，一定能把早稻管得更好。
    及早加强早稻管理，对早稻增产有决定作用，对晚稻增产也有极大作用。在双季稻产区，早稻、晚稻是连续收种的。早稻早收，晚稻才能早插。晚稻插秧越早，产量越高。“晚稻不过秋，过秋九不收。”早稻早熟、早收，晚稻才能早插早管。为了争取水稻大丰收，一定要把“一早百早”的精神，坚持不懈地贯串在从早稻到晚稻的整个管理过程中。
