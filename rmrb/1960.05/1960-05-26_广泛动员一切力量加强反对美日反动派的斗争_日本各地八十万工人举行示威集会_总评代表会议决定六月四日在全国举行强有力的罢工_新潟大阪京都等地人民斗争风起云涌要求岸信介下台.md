Xinhua News Agency, May 25th, Tokyo Dispatch: Eight hundred thousand workers in Japan held demonstrations and rallies across the country today.
    The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) Representative Meeting Decided to Hold a Powerful Nationwide Strike on June 4th.
    People's struggles surged in Niigata, Osaka, Kyoto, and other places, demanding the resignation of Nobusuke Kishi.
    Xinhua News Agency, May 25th, Tokyo Dispatch: Eight hundred thousand workers in Japan held workplace rallies across the country today, demanding the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and the dissolution of the Diet.

    These workers are members of the All-Japan Trade Union Congress. This is the first large-scale action by this trade union since it took similar action two years ago to oppose the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law." Earlier, the All-Japan Trade Union Congress had rejected the proposal by the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan for joint action to oppose the US-Japan "Security Treaty." However, today's "Akahata" reported that grassroots members of various unions affiliated with the All-Japan Trade Union Congress took noteworthy actions to support joint struggles with the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan to prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty" and the dissolution of the Diet.

    Workers from the All-Japan Trade Union Congress also launched a signature campaign across Japan yesterday and today. In Tokyo, they collected signatures from passersby in four locations.

    On May 27th, the All-Japan Trade Union Congress will hold a national conference in Tokyo, demanding the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, the dissolution of the Diet, and the abolition of the new US-Japan "Security Treaty."

    The signatures collected by members of the All-Japan Trade Union Congress will be sent to this conference from all over Japan.

    Xinhua News Agency, May 25th, Tokyo Dispatch: The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) decided on the afternoon of the 24th that unions of private enterprises affiliated with Sohyo would hold a twelve-hour strike on June 4th, and unions of state-run enterprises would hold a two-hour strike, demanding the abolition of the new US-Japan "Security Treaty," the dissolution of the Diet, and the general resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet.

    This decision was made at a meeting of representatives of various unions affiliated with Sohyo, who urgently requested discussion of Sohyo's action program to deal with the new situation created after the Kishi Nobusuke government forcibly "passed" the new US-Japan "Security Treaty" in the House of Representatives. Representatives of forty member unions attended the meeting on the 24th.

    The representative meeting also decided to participate daily in protest demonstrations and marches to the Diet, etc., led by the "National Conference to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty."

    When presenting Sohyo's action program to the meeting, Sohyo Secretary-General Akira Iwai emphasized that the decisive factor in the struggle to dissolve the Diet and overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet was for workers to show their strength in their workplaces. Iwai said, "Now workers should show their greatest strength on June 4th and hold a powerful strike."

    One after another, representatives of affiliated unions expressed their determination at the meeting to overcome all difficulties in the large-scale strike and ensure its victory.

    Sohyo also decided to launch a fundraising campaign among its member workers to prepare for relief funds for workers who may be laid off due to the June 4th strike.

    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 25th: The Japanese people's struggle demanding the dissolution of the Diet, the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, and opposition to the Diet's ratification of the US-Japan military alliance treaty is surging and continuing to develop vigorously throughout the country.

    In Niigata Prefecture, approximately 120,000 workers and other citizens held rallies in twenty-seven locations throughout the prefecture on the 24th, protesting the fascist atrocities of the Kishi Nobusuke group in forcibly "passing" the new US-Japan "Security Treaty" in the House of Representatives, demanding the dissolution of the Diet and the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, and expressing strong opposition to Eisenhower's visit to Japan. They also demanded the withdrawal of U-2 spy planes from Japan. After the meeting, participants held demonstrations in the city.

    In Osaka City, approximately 20,000 people held a rally on the 24th to protest the Kishi Nobusuke group's forcible "passage" of the new "Security Treaty" in the House of Representatives. After the meeting, the masses held a three-hour demonstration march in front of the Osaka City Hall and other places.

    The joint struggle organization formed by people from all walks of life in Osaka has also scheduled demonstrations and marches in more than twenty locations in Osaka Prefecture on the 26th, resolutely opposing the US-Japan military alliance treaty.

    Workers and students in Kyoto held a protest rally against the ratification of the new "Security Treaty" on the evening of the 23rd. After the meeting, about two thousand people held a demonstration march in the city.

    The Kanagawa Prefectural Conference Demanding the Abolition of the "Security Treaty" has collected 300,000 signatures against the Diet's ratification of the "Security Treaty." Now, this organization is actively carrying out activities with the goal of collecting one million signatures. It also decided on the evening of the 23rd to send five thousand representatives to Tokyo on the 26th to petition the Diet.

    The Fukuoka Prefectural Joint Struggle Conference Against the "Security Treaty" decided on the afternoon of the 24th to launch an even stronger struggle than before. On the 26th, it will hold regional rallies in fifty locations to protest the revision of the "Security Treaty," and from the 26th, it will carry out signature campaigns and distribute pamphlets protesting the revision of the "Security Treaty" on the streets every day.

    Following the Omuta City Council, the Moriguchi City Council in Osaka Prefecture also passed a resolution on the 24th demanding the general resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and the dissolution of the House of Representatives. This resolution was jointly proposed by Socialist and Communist Party members.

    The Tottori Prefectural Assembly is also dissatisfied with the fascist atrocities of the Kishi Nobusuke group. This assembly decided to send telegrams to Nobusuke Kishi and Ichiro Kiyose, Speaker of the House of Representatives, etc., resolutely demanding that they "reflect."

    Xinhua News Agency, May 25th, Tokyo Dispatch: More than three thousand young workers in Japan held a rally this evening at Miyamoto Park near Nobusuke Kishi's private residence, demanding the abolition of the new US-Japan "Security Treaty."

    Socialist Party member Tanaka Toshio, speaking at the rally, called on the workers attending the rally to intensify the movement to protest Eisenhower's visit to Japan and the US signing of the new "Security Treaty" with Japan. He said, "We are determined to exert our greatest strength to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and dissolve the Diet."

    Mio Yanagimoto, Director of the Political Department of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, said that the Japanese people's struggle against the US-Japan military alliance has attracted worldwide attention. Yanagimoto said, our "struggle is a struggle to defend world peace, let us always remember this and vigorously launch our movement."

    The rally passed a declaration strongly demanding the abolition of the new "Security Treaty," the dissolution of the Diet, and the general resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet. The resolution passed by the rally also expressed the opposition of young workers to US President Dwight D. Eisenhower's visit to Japan.

    After the rally, three thousand young workers began marching towards Nobusuke Kishi's private residence to demonstrate. Along the way, another thousand workers joined the demonstration. Demonstrating workers completely surrounded Kishi Nobusuke's residence.

    The streets and alleys near Kishi Nobusuke's residence became an ocean of red flags and lanterns carried by the demonstrators.

    In front of the gate of Kishi Nobusuke's residence, they held a wave-like demonstration for more than an hour and a half, shouting slogans saying: "We do not recognize the 'Security' Treaty!" "Kishi Nobusuke get out of Japan!" "Dissolve the Diet now!" (Attached image)

    全日本工会会议的工人们今天和昨天还在全日本各地展开了征集签名运动。在东京，他们在四个地方向过路的人征集了签名。
    5月27日，全日本工会会议将在东京举行全国会议，要求岸信介内阁辞职，解散国会和废除新日美“安全条约”。

    总评议会事务局长岩井章在向会议提出总评的行动纲领时强调指出，使国会解散和推翻岸信介内阁的斗争中的决定因素是工人们在他们的工作场所显示他们的力量。岩井章说，“现在工人们应该在6月4日表现出最大的力量，举行强有力的罢工。”
    所属工会的代表一个接一个地在会上表示决心要在大规模的罢工中克服一切困难，使罢工取得胜利。
    总评议会还决定开始在会员工人中间开展募捐运动以准备作为由于6月4日罢工而可能被解雇的工人的救济金。

    继大牟田市议会以后，大阪府守口市议会24日也通过了要求岸信介内阁总辞职和解散众议院的决议。这项决议是社会党和共产党议员联合提出的。
    鸟取县议会也对岸信介集团的法西斯暴行不满。这个议会决定打电报给岸信介和众议院议长清濑一郎等人，坚决要求他们“反省”。
    新华社25日讯　东京消息：日本三千多青年工人今天晚间在岸信介私人住宅附近的宫本公园举行大会，要求废除新日美“安全条约”。

    日本工会总评议会政治部长柳本美雄说，日本人民反对日美军事同盟的斗争受到全世界的注意。柳本说，我们的“斗争是保卫世界和平的斗争，我们永远记住这一点，让我们大力地展开我们的运动”。
    大会通过了宣言，强烈要求废除新“安全条约”，解散国会和岸信介内阁总辞职。大会通过的决议还表示青年工人反对美国总统艾森豪威尔访问日本。
