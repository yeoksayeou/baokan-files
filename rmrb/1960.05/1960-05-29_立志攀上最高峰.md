The news of victory has arrived from the Himalayas: Mount Everest, the world's highest peak, has been conquered by Chinese mountaineers. The mountaineers’ ascent to the world's highest peak, more than 8,000 meters above sea level, has made people feel excited and joyful, and also inspired and educated them. Our thoughts seem to follow in the footsteps of the mountaineers, climbing the towering peaks, and a vast world suddenly appears before our eyes.

Our mountaineers' ascent of Mount Everest from the north slope can be regarded as conquering the "cutting edge" of the earth, a celebratory achievement. For nearly half a century, foreign mountaineers have been eager to try this peak, but no one has ever been able to climb to the summit from the north slope. However, we have climbed it. Look, haven't the footprints of the heroes of the motherland already been left on the summit that even birds cannot pass? Truly, no height is unclimbable, no fortress is impregnable. In the eyes of the heroic Chinese people, there is nothing in the world that cannot be done, no difficulty that cannot be overcome, and no force that can stop us from advancing.

The mountaineers did not climb to the world's highest peak by relying on physical strength alone. The powerful force within them did not arise out of thin air. They possess revolutionary aspirations that are ten million times higher than Mount Everest, a dauntless heroic spirit, and iron-like revolutionary perseverance. With the high peak standing before them, whether or not to conquer it is a tremendous test. With the communist spirit of daring to think and daring to act, the world's highest peak became insignificant in the eyes of the mountaineering heroes. Looking at the extremely harsh natural environment and conditions, the heroes' soaring ambitions and revolutionary spirit are even more admirable. Perennial snow, steep ice walls, treacherous primitive glaciers, howling winds, massive avalanches, and temperatures of thirty or forty degrees below zero... In the face of these difficulties, danger could be encountered at any time, and every step could lead to a fall into an abyss. However, the mountaineers conquered all of this with their courage and wisdom, with their firm belief in winning honor for the motherland, and with the revolutionary spirit of collectivism. The heroes' soaring ambitions made the majestic summit of Mount Everest bow its head, the fierce wind and snow were tamed, and the heroes' feet carved a path from the treacherous ice and snow to the world's highest peak. All of this proves to us that no difficulty is insurmountable and that everything can be conquered. "Where there is a will, there is a way." Under the feet of revolutionaries, the road is infinitely broad.

The heroic actions of the mountaineers are a reflection of the revolutionary spirit of the Chinese people. What the Chinese people want to climb is not just this 8,000-meter world peak, but thousands upon thousands of lofty and arduous world peaks, the peaks of all science, technology, and culture. "In science, there is no royal road, and only those who do not dread the fatigue of climbing up the narrow paths have any hope of reaching its brilliant summits." The Chinese people, like those heroic mountaineers, are determined, full of vigor, and marching toward the brilliant summits of all the world's peaks, determined to climb all the world's peaks.

    立志攀上最高峰
    于静
    喜马拉雅山上传来胜利的消息，世界上最高的山峰，珠穆朗玛峰被我国登山运动员征服了。登山队员们踏上拔海八千多米的世界高峰，这件事情使人们感到兴奋、愉快，也从中得到了启发，受到了教育。我们的思想好像随着登山队员们的步伐，攀上了高耸天际的山峰，眼前顿时出现了一幅广阔的天地。
    我国登山队员从北坡攀登上珠穆朗玛峰，可算是攻下了地球上的“尖端”，这是一件值得庆贺的创举。近半个世纪来，外国的登山家望着这座高峰跃跃欲试，但始终没有一个人能从北坡攀登上顶峰。然而，我们攀登上了。请看，那连飞鸟也通不过的山巅上，不是已经留下了祖国英雄们的足迹了吗？真是无高不可攀，无坚不可摧，在英雄的中国人民的眼里，世界上没有做不到的事情，没有克服不了的困难，没有任何力量能够阻挡我们前进的道路。
    登山队员们不是只凭着身强力壮才攀上世界高峰的。他们身上那股强大力量，不是凭空产生的，他们有着比珠穆朗玛峰还要高出千万倍的革命志气，有着大无畏的英雄气概和如铁似钢的革命毅力。高峰耸立在眼前，敢不敢去征服它，是一个巨大的考验。登山英雄们有了敢想敢做的共产主义精神，世界高峰在他们面前也变得渺小起来了。看看那些险恶万分的自然环境和条件，英雄们的凌云壮志和革命气概就更加使人敬佩不已了。万年的积雪、陡峭的冰墙、险恶的原始冰川，嘶叫的旋风，巨大的雪崩，零下三、四十度的严寒……。在这一重重的困难中，随时都会遇到危险，每一步都可能掉进万丈深渊。但是，登山队员们凭着他们的勇敢和智慧，凭着他们为祖国争取荣誉的坚强信念，凭着革命的集体主义精神，把这一切都征服了。英雄们的凌云壮志，使得珠穆朗玛峰巍峨的山巅低头了，狂风暴雪驯服了，英雄们的双脚从险恶的冰雪中踏出了一条通往世界高峰的道路。所有这些都向我们证明，任何困难都是不可怕的，都是可以征服的。“有志者事竟成”，革命者的脚下，道路是无限宽广的。
    登山队员的英雄行为，正是我国人民的革命精神的反映。我国人民要攀登的不只是这座八千多米的世界高峰，而是千千万万座崇高而又艰巨的世界高峰，是一切科学技术文化的高峰。“在科学上面是没有平安的大路可走的，只有那在崎岖小路的攀登上不畏劳苦的人，有希望到达光辉的顶点”。我国人民正像那些英雄的登山队员一样心怀大志，鼓足干劲，向着一切世界高峰的光辉顶点迈进，立志要攀登上所有世界上的高峰。
