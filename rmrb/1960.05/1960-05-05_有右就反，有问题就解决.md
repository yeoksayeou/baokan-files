Oppose Rightism Whenever It Appears, Solve Problems as They Arise
Wang Pu

After reading the news about the fluctuating production levels of the Xi'an Qinling Thermos Factory and the Taiyuan Xishan Mining Bureau in April, from high to low and then from low to high, I was reminded of a sentence from Comrade Mao Zedong's book "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." The sentence reads: "Under certain conditions, bad things can lead to good results, and good things can also lead to bad results."

So, in production and construction, under what conditions do bad things lead to good results, transforming unfavorable situations into favorable ones? And under what conditions can good things lead to bad results, meaning good things are not handled well, leading to bad results? The decisive factor is not material or technical strength, but the drive of the people, their state of mind. If the drive is sufficient, the subjective initiative is fully utilized, and the spirit of continuous revolution is upheld, then so-called technical backwardness, insufficient production capacity, and inadequate supply of raw materials will become the driving force for us to engage in large-scale technical innovation and technical revolution, and bad things will lead to good results. Low output and backwardness are temporary; with our efforts, they can be transformed into high output and advanced levels. Conversely, if the drive is insufficient, or if one becomes complacent and slack after achieving some success, high output will turn into low output. Take the Xi'an Qinling Thermos Factory and the Taiyuan Xishan Mining Bureau as examples: one achieved great success in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, increasing production capacity by more than double; the other overfulfilled the first quarter's plan. These were both originally good things. If they had continued to exert their efforts and strive for the top, they could have ridden the waves and achieved even greater victories, creating even better production results. However, because a few cadres in these two units became complacent and slack after achieving some success, and no longer went to the workshops frequently, they did not promptly resolve new contradictions that arose in production. As a result, production declined for a time, and they failed to complete the plan, which led to bad results. Once they re-opposed right-leaning sentiments and regained their drive, production rose steadily again. From this, we can draw a most important lesson: we must always maintain sufficient drive, always uphold the theory of continuous revolution, and immediately organize comrades in any department where right-leaning conservative ideas appear to launch criticism; whenever right-leaning conservative ideas appear, we must immediately oppose them and correct them; we must oppose rightism whenever it appears and constantly move forward. We must always remember Chairman Mao's instruction: solve problems immediately as they arise, and do not wait until problems pile up before solving them.

To oppose rightism whenever it appears, we must always grasp political and ideological work and pay attention to the ideological trends of cadres and the masses. When things are difficult to handle and there are many difficulties, we must prevent and overcome the right-leaning conservative thinking that assumes this won't work or that can't be done, and advocate knowing the difficulties and advancing, the more difficult it is, the more we must revolutionize, transforming unfavorable factors into favorable ones. When things are easier to handle or when some achievements have been made, we must prevent and overcome the blind optimism or the complacent and slack thinking that assumes it's almost done. We must advocate the theory of continuous revolution, and immediately propose new combat tasks after completing one battle.

To solve problems as they arise, we must always grasp production, grasp it from top to bottom, grasp it daily and shift by shift, grasp it firmly, and grasp it thoroughly. We must earnestly solve the problems in production, and problems that should be solved today must never be dragged on until tomorrow. We must grasp both today and tomorrow; we must grasp both the weak links and the other links. All work must revolve around production, and the technical innovation and technical revolution movement is no exception. The purpose of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement is to develop production at a high speed. The direction of production development is the direction of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement; the problems that urgently need to be solved in production are the targets of the technical innovation and technical revolution offensive. Aim at the target, mobilize the masses, constantly innovate technology, and continuously promote production development.

Oppose rightism whenever it appears, solve problems as they arise, and hold high the banner of continuous revolution, so that production can develop wave upon wave, realizing "a red start, a red all over, and red to the end," and there will be a practical guarantee.

    有右就反，有问题就解决
    王朴
    读了西安市秦岭热水瓶厂和太原西山矿务局4月份生产从高到低、又从低到高变化的消息，想起了毛泽东同志在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”一书里讲的一句话来。这句话是这样说的：“在一定的条件下，坏的东西可以引出好的结果，好的东西也可以引出坏的结果。”
    那么，在生产和建设中，是什么样的条件，使坏的东西引出好的结果，变坏事为好事呢？又是什么样的条件，好的东西也可以引出坏的结果，就是没有把好事办好，引出了坏结果呢？决定性的条件，不是物质技术力量，而是人的干劲，人的思想状态。干劲足，主观能动作用充分发挥又坚持不断革命精神的，所谓技术落后、生产能力不足、原材料供应不足等等，就会变成促进我们大搞技术革新、技术革命的动力，坏的东西就引出好的结果。低产、落后，都是暂时的，经过我们的努力，就可以变为高产和先进。反之，如果干劲不足，或者有了一点成就就自满松劲，高产又会变为低产。拿西安市秦岭热水瓶制造厂和太原西山矿务局来说吧，一个是在技术革新、技术革命运动中，取得了很大的成绩，生产能力提高了一倍多；一个是超额完成了第一季度的计划，这本来都是好事。要是继续鼓足干劲，力争上游的话，是完全可以乘风破浪，夺取更大的胜利，创造更好的生产成绩的。可是，由于这两个单位的少数干部有了点成就就松劲自满，也不再经常到车间去了，对生产中发生的新矛盾不及时加以解决，结果，生产就一度下降，完不成计划，这就引出了坏的结果。等到重新反掉了右倾情绪，重新鼓起干劲，生产又稳步上升。从这里，我们得出一条最重要的经验，就是要永远鼓足干劲，永远坚持不断革命论，什么部门出现了右倾保守思想，就立即组织那里的同志展开批判；什么时候出现右倾保守思想，就马上反对，马上纠正；要有右就反，不断前进。要时时记着毛主席的指示：一有问题就立即解决，不要等问题成堆以后才去解决。
    要做到有右就反，就要时刻抓政治思想工作，注意干部和群众的思想动向。在事情比较不好办，困难比较多的时候，就要防止和克服那种认为这也不行，那也办不到的右倾保守思想，提倡知难而进，越困难越要革命，变不利因素为有利因素。在事情比较好办，或者取得了一些成就的时候，就要防止和克服那种盲目乐观或者认为已经差不多了的自满松劲思想，要提倡不断革命论，打完一仗马上提出新的战斗任务。
    要做到有问题就解决，就要时刻抓生产，自上而下的抓，按日按班的抓，狠狠的抓，一抓到底。要切切实实地解决生产中的问题，今天应当解决的问题，决不拖到明天。既要抓今天，又要抓明天；既要抓薄弱环节，又要抓其他环节。一切工作都要围绕着生产进行，技术革新、技术革命运动也不例外。技术革新、技术革命运动的目的，是为了高速度地发展生产。生产发展的方向，就是技术革新、技术革命运动的方向；生产上迫切解决的问题，就是技术革新、技术革命进攻的目标。对准目标，发动群众，不断地革新技术，不停顿地促进生产发展。
    有右就反，有问题就解决，把不断革命论的旗帜举得高高的，生产就可以一浪高过一浪地向前发展，实现“开门红，满堂红，红到底”，也就有切实的保证了。
