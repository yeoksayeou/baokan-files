Xinhua News Agency, 4th dispatch, Tokyo: Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi has once again publicly expressed hostility towards China and arrogantly attempted to re-establish Japan's grip on Chinese territory.

According to Japanese newspapers today, at a meeting of the Special Committee on the "Security Treaty" of the Japanese House of Representatives yesterday, Nobusuke Kishi, in response to a question from Socialist Party member Minoru Tanaka, actually said that "the Taiwan issue is not simply a matter of China's internal affairs," and that if an armed conflict were to occur there, "Japan cannot but be concerned."

In answering questions, Kishi also revealed his ambition to implement nuclear armament for the purpose of aggression, saying that establishing a nuclear-free zone in Asia "does not make much sense," and that there is currently "no basis" for concluding a non-aggression treaty.

Regarding the issue of Japan's war reparations to China, Nobusuke Kishi stubbornly insisted that because the Japanese government had signed the so-called "Sino-Japanese Peace Treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek Group, the issue of paying reparations to China "has already been resolved." Kishi also stated that he would continue to understand the issue in this way in the future.

Tanaka Minoru pursued Kishi's responsibility as a cabinet member at the time regarding the issue of Chinese laborers who were forcibly transported to Japan during the war and died as a result.

Although Kishi admitted that he had "moral" responsibility, he attempted to evade responsibility, stubbornly claiming that he was "not very clear" about the cabinet meeting's decision regarding the forced transportation of Chinese laborers.

The Japanese "Sankei Shimbun" published a commentary today pointing out that Kishi had not made any fundamental answers to the basic question of how to establish normal relations between Japan and the countries of the Far East. The commentary pointed out that the political issue of Japan paying war reparations to China remains unresolved, and there is no doubt about that.

### 岸信介公然狂妄表示  日本要重新染指我国领土

    岸信介公然狂妄表示
    日本要重新染指我国领土
    新华社4日讯　东京消息：日本首相岸信介再一次公开表示敌视中国并且狂妄地企图重新染指中国的领土。
    据日本报纸今天报道，在昨天举行的日本众议院“安全条约”特别委员会会议上，岸信介在答复社会党议员田中稔男的质询时竟说，“台湾问题不是单纯的中国内政问题”，假使在那里发生武装纷争，“日本是不能不关心的”。
    岸信介在答复质询时还暴露了实行以侵略为目的核武装的野心，他说什么在亚洲建立非核武装地区“没有多大意思”，还说目前还“没有出现”缔结互不侵犯条约的“基础”。
    关于日本对中国的战争赔偿问题，岸信介硬说由于日本政府同蒋介石集团签订了所谓“日华和约”，对中国支付赔偿的问题“已经解决”。岸信介并且表示，关于这个问题他今后也要这样理解。
    田中稔男就战争时期被劫运到日本因而死亡的中国劳工问题追究了当时作为内阁阁员的岸信介的责任。
    岸信介虽然承认他有“道义上”的责任，但他又企图逃避责任，硬说他对当时内阁会议有关劫运中国劳工的决定“不大明白”。
    日本“产经新闻”今天发表评论指出，岸信介对于应该怎样建立日本同远东各国的正常关系的基本问题根本没有作出答复。评论指出，日本对中国支付战争赔偿这个政治问题仍然悬而未决，这是毫无疑问的。
