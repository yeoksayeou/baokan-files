Editor's Note: The Japanese people's struggle against the Diet's approval of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty has now spread from the working class to other strata of society. The following is a selection of materials from recent Japanese newspapers. From these facts, it can be seen that the anti-American patriotic struggle is increasingly deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and under the leadership and influence of the Japanese working class, the broad masses of people are generally awakening and standing on the front line against the United States and against Nobusuke Kishi.

		The Fighting Spirit of Farmers

    Gunma Prefecture, Japan, recently organized a prefectural farmers' grand parade against the "Security Treaty." Farmers carried various large-character slogans and banners, and their emotions were exceptionally high. On the day of the parade, mass rallies were held in villages and towns throughout the prefecture, setting off a wave of mass protests.

    Farmers who did not participate in the parade raised activity funds and collected petition signatures for the representatives sent to Tokyo. They also helped families participating in the parade by milking cows. Wherever the parade went, it saw the warm sympathy of people eager to strive for peace, independence, and democracy. A rural woman carrying a nursing baby said emotionally, "Seeing the red flag is like seeing a close relative." Farmers working in the fields also stopped to greet the parade cordially. When camping at night, many strangers rushed to offer their houses for the paraders to stay overnight. The farmers' grand parade in Gunma Prefecture demonstrated the fighting spirit of the farmers.

		Women's Awakening

    Recently, the Ishikawa Prefecture "Women's Movement Month Action Committee" held an Ishikawa Prefecture Women's Anti-"Security Treaty" rally in a cherry blossom-filled park in Kanazawa City. Each of the more than 1,500 female workers and housewives participating in the rally held a seven-colored balloon with the word "Peace" written on it. They attached letters they had written to their sisters across the country to the balloons and released them together. The women participating in the rally expressed their determination to unite and fight to the end to prevent the Diet from approving the new "Security Treaty."

    In addition, even in Tokushima Prefecture, which has always been regarded as the most remote, women have recently taken action and formed the "Women's Association for the Protection of Peace and Life," and held a protest rally against the approval of the new "Security Treaty." After the meeting, three hundred women held a demonstration parade in front of the city office. This is an epoch-making move in the history of the women's movement in Tokushima Prefecture.

		University Professors Take Active Action

    In the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic struggle, scholars, professors, and other academic and cultural figures have also actively participated. Sixteen professors from Kyoto University, including Fumihiko Tachikawa, formed the "Kyoto University Professors' Delegation" on April 28 and went to Tokyo to petition after collecting more than 230 petition signatures. A group of seven famous philosophers, including Risaku Mutai, a professor at Keio University, initiated the "Group of Volunteers of Japanese Philosophy Researchers," and its sixty-five representatives in Tokyo took the five hundred signatures collected from philosophical circles to the Diet to petition on the day of the 15th Unified Action on April 26. In their petition, they said: "The new 'Security Treaty' will revive militarism in our country and endanger freedom of thought and speech, so we philosophy researchers resolutely oppose it."

    In addition, the "Hokkaido Cultural Figures Anti-'Security Treaty' Association," composed of university professors, writers, sculptors, and singers, has also strengthened its petition activities against the Diet's approval of the new "Security Treaty." Furthermore, university professors and other cultural figures throughout Kyushu and professors at Osaka City University recently held meetings, issued statements, and actively promoted the collection of petition signatures in the local cultural circles.

		Protest by One Thousand Christians

    On May 3 this year, one thousand Christians from nine prefectures, including Tokyo, Chiba, Saitama, Kanagawa, Osaka, and Kyoto, held a protest rally in Tokyo against the Diet's approval of the new "Security Treaty." Hatsue Nomiya said at the meeting: "We want to protest against the Nobusuke Kishi government that violates God's will." After the meeting, the participants sang hymns and held a parade, expressing their determination to prevent the approval of the new "Security Treaty."

		Buddhists Hold Hunger Strike

    Two devout Buddhists, Tadahiro Kimura, a student at Tokyo Medical University, and Kunio Tsuboi, a playwright, have been holding a twenty-one-day hunger strike at Honpō-ji Temple in Asakusa, Taito-ku, Tokyo, since April 16, protesting Nobusuke Kishi's conspiracy to forcibly approve the new "Security Treaty" in the Diet.

    They believe that the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" will plunge the Japanese people into greater misfortune, and as Buddhists, they cannot but express their protest. They have received enthusiastic support from Buddhist circles after the hunger strike. During the hunger strike, Buddhists came to Honpō-ji Temple every day to encourage them and pray to prevent the approval of the new "Security Treaty." And the "Japan Buddhist Peace Agreement," which supports their actions, called on all Buddhists to fast for one day on the eve of the 15th Unified Action in order to carry out a political movement to prevent the approval of the new "Security Treaty," setting off a wave of action against the approval of the new "Security Treaty" among Buddhist circles.

		Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Oppose Approval of the New Treaty

    Representatives of various small and medium-sized enterprise groups recently held a meeting in Tokyo and issued a statement in the name of the "Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises 'Security Treaty' Roundtable" opposing the Diet's approval of the new "Security Treaty." The statement condemned the Nobusuke Kishi government's conspiracy to force the Diet to approve the new "Security Treaty" and pointed out the harm of the new "Security Treaty" to Japanese politics, economy, people's lives, and the struggle for the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations and trade. Prominent business figures such as the chairman of the All-Japan Federation of Trade and Industry Associations also signed the statement.

		Kansai Capitalists Petition

    On April 20 this year, the "Kansai Secretariat of the Committee for Promoting the Reopening of Sino-Japanese Trade," based in Osaka, submitted a petition to the speakers of both houses of the Japanese Diet and all members of the Diet opposing the Diet's approval of the new "Security Treaty." The secretariat is composed of representatives of large capitalist companies based in the Kansai region of Japan, centered on Osaka, such as "Nichimen Jitsugyo" Corporation, "Marubeni Iida" Corporation, "Hitachi Zosen" Corporation, and "Shimadzu Corporation."

    The petition stated: "Do not rush to approve the new Security Treaty, and do not rely on a formal majority to approve this treaty in the Diet!" They also said: "Regarding the signing of this treaty, the Nobusuke Kishi government not only has many very inappropriate points in its Diet answers, but even made remarks that stimulated neighboring countries, resulting in condemnation from the Soviet Union, China, and others, and Southeast Asian countries have also raised criticisms. After learning of this situation, we came to the conclusion that we should not rush to approve this treaty. We believe that the Diet must not rely on a formal majority to decide the issue."

    反美爱国斗争深入日本各阶层
    编者按　目前，日本人民反对国会批准日美军事同盟条约的斗争，已经从工人阶级扩展到其他各阶层。下面是从最近日本报刊上摘下的一部分材料。从这些事实，可以看出反美爱国斗争日益深入人心，在日本工人阶级带领和影响下，广大阶层普遍觉醒，纷纷站到反美和反岸信介的战线上来。
          农民的斗志
    日本群马县最近组织了一次全县农民反对“安全条约”大游行。农民们打着各种大字标语旗，情绪异常激昂。在游行的当天，县内各村镇都召开大会，掀起了群众性的抗议浪潮。
    没有参加游行的农民为派赴东京的请愿代表募集活动费和征集请愿签名。他们还帮助参加游行的人家挤牛奶。游行队伍不论走到哪个村镇，都看到人们渴望争取和平、独立、民主的热烈同情。背着吃奶娃娃的农村妇女感动地说：“一看到红旗，就像见了亲兄弟一样。”正在田里劳动的农民也停下来亲切地向游行队伍致意。到了夜里宿营时，许多素不相识的人，争先恐后地让出房子请游行的人过夜。群马县农民大游行显示了农民的斗志。
          妇女的觉醒
    最近，日本石川县“妇女运动月行动委员会”在金泽市樱花盛开的公园里，召开了石川县妇女反对“安全条约”大会。参加这次大会的一千五百多名女工和主妇，每人手里都拿着一个写有“和平”字样的七色气球。她们把自己写的告全国姊妹的信附在气球上一起放出去。参加大会的妇女们表示坚决团结一致，为阻止国会批准新“安全条约”斗争到底。
    此外，在一向被目为最冷僻的德岛县，最近妇女们也行动起来，组成了“妇女保卫和平与生活会”，并且召开了妇女反对批准新“安全条约”的抗议集会。会后，三百名妇女在市公署前面举行了示威游行。这是德岛县妇女运动史上划时代的举动。
      大学教授积极行动
    在日本人民反美爱国斗争中，学者、教授等学术文化界人士也都积极参加。京都大学的立川文彦等十六名教授，在征集了二百三十多个请愿签名后，于4月28日组成“京大教授代表团”赴东京请愿。以庆应大学教授务台理作等七位著名哲学家发起的“日本哲学研究者有志之士”团体在东京的代表六十五人，在4月26日第十五次统一行动那一天，拿着征集到的五百名哲学界人士的签名到国会请愿。他们在请愿书中说：“新‘安全条约’使我国军国主义复活，使思想言论自由有遭到压迫的危险，因此我们哲学研究者坚决地反对。”
    此外，由大学教授、作家、雕刻家和歌唱家组成的“北海道文化界人士反对‘安全条约’会”也加强了反对国会批准新“安全条约”的请愿活动。而整个九州的大学教授等文化界人士和大阪的市立大学教授也于最近举行集会，发表声明，并积极推进在当地文化界征集请愿签名的工作。
      一千名基督徒的抗议
    今年5月3日，来自东京都、千叶县、埼玉县、神奈川县、大阪府及京都府等九个都府县的一千名基督教徒，在东京举行了反对国会批准新“安全条约”的抗议集会。野宫初枝在会上说：“我们要抗议违背上帝钧旨的岸信介政府。”会议结束后，与会者唱着赞美歌举行游行，表明了阻止批准新“安全条约”的决心。
      佛教徒举行绝食斗争
    日本东京医科大学学生木村忠弘和剧作家坪井邦夫两位虔诚的佛教徒，从4月16日起在东京都台东区浅草的本法寺内举行二十一天的绝食斗争，抗议岸信介在国会强行批准新“安全条约”的阴谋活动。
    他们认为新日美“安全条约”会使日本人民陷于更大的不幸之中，作为佛教徒，不能不表示抗议。他们在绝食后受到佛教界人士的热烈支援。在绝食期间，每天都有佛教徒到本法寺来鼓励他们，并为阻止批准新“安全条约”进行祈愿。而支持他们行动的“日本佛教徒和平协议会”为了开展阻止批准新“安全条约”的政治运动，在第十五次统一行动日前夕，号召全体佛教徒绝食一天，在佛教界人士中间掀起了反对批准新“安全条约”的行动热潮。
        中小企业反对批准新条约
    中小企业界各团体代表，最近在东京举行集会，以“中小企业‘安全条约’恳谈会”名义，发表了反对国会批准新“安全条约”的声明。声明中谴责了岸信介政府企图强使国会批准新“安全条约”的阴谋，并且指出新“安全条约”对于日本政治、经济和人民生活以及争取日中邦交、贸易正常化的危害性。全日本工商联合会会长等著名企业界人士也在声明上签了名。
        关西大资本家请愿
    今年4月20日，设在大阪的“重开日中贸易推进委员会关西干事会”，向日本国会众参两院议长和全体议员提出了反对国会批准新“安全条约”的请愿书。干事会是由以大阪为中心的日本关西地方的“日棉实业”公司、“丸红饭田”公司、“日立造船”公司和“岛津制作所”等大企业公司的大资本家代表组成的。
    请愿书提出：“不要急于批准新安全条约，不许依靠形式上的多数在国会批准这个条约！”他们还说：“关于签署这次的条约问题，岸信介政府在国会答辩中不仅有许多十分欠妥的地方，而居然发表刺激近邻各国的言论，以致引起苏联、中国等的谴责，而东南亚各国也纷纷提出责难。获悉这种情况后，我们得出了不要急于批准这次条约的结论。我们认为国会决不能依靠形式上的多数来决定问题”。
