Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin: To ensure a good harvest, the first step is to protect the seedlings. While carrying out crash planting to combat drought, people in Hebei are also universally carrying out activities such as checking and replanting seedlings, increasing moisture retention to protect seedlings, and planting "reserve seedlings" to resolutely ensure that various crops are planted fully and well according to plan, laying a good foundation for achieving large-scale high yields of grain at 1,000 catties per mu, cotton at 100 catties per mu, and potatoes at 10,000 catties per mu.

This year, spring planting in Hebei has been carried out in the course of a tenacious struggle against severe drought. By May 1st, the province had nearly completed its cotton planting plan, and nearly half of the field crops had been planted. Due to the drought, some of the planted crops' seeds were drying out, preventing them from sprouting, and some seedlings were growing weakly after emerging from the soil. In order to ensure sprouting, protect all seedlings, ensure vigorous seedling growth, and ensure a good harvest, all localities have conducted thorough inspections, replanting as they inspect, ensuring that not a single mu is missed, not a single furrow is broken, and not a single seedling is lacking. Communes are also planting small seedling nurseries and "standby replanting furrows" to prepare enough "reserve seedlings" for replanting and transplanting; plowing the land in advance, watering more, and increasing moisture retention to protect the seedlings, turning weak seedlings into strong seedlings. In the Handan and Shijiazhuang areas, 800,000 mu of cotton fields with missing seedlings have been replanted, and more than 1,000,000 mu of weak cotton fields have also been "hoed and irrigated," and a large number of small seedling nurseries have also been planted. "Standby replanting furrows" have been planted in more than 2,000,000 mu of cotton fields, ready for transplanting and replanting.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan: Since it rained in Shandong from the 6th to the 9th, the broad masses of commune members are seizing the excellent opportunity after the rain to rush planting. Leading cadres at all levels in the Linyi area have gone deep into the fields, dividing up areas of responsibility, and rushing to plant with the masses. While rushing to plant, Tancheng County is also carrying out a campaign for each person to plant one fen of vegetables, thirty pumpkin plants, and fifty sunflower or castor bean plants. Now, a new high tide in spring planting work has been formed in various parts of the province.

Since Shandong Province suffered from drought last year, it has suffered continuous severe spring droughts this year, with the affected area and the severity of the drought being unprecedented in decades. In order to win a great agricultural harvest this year, under the leadership of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Party committees at all levels, the people of the province, with the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains, launched a vigorous campaign to combat drought and protect wheat and combat drought and plant seeds. As of May 3rd, more than 30,000,000 mu of wheat had been watered at the jointing stage, and more than 55% of the drought-resistant planting tasks had been completed. When the rain started on May 6th, the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China immediately held a meeting, calling on the people of the province to mobilize urgently and seize the opportunity to quickly complete the spring planting task with the vigor of running iron and steel production on a large scale; at the same time, they must firmly establish the idea of long-term drought resistance and fight the drought to the end.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan: Most areas of Shanxi Province received rain from the 4th to the 8th, and the drought situation has been eased somewhat. The rain-fed areas are rushing to plant and strengthen the late-stage management of wheat fields.

The Pingyao County Party Committee convened an emergency meeting to deploy late-stage wheat field management even before the rain stopped, issuing a battle call to "take advantage of the welcome rain, work hard, and increase production by 20 catties per mu." More than 50,000 commune members in the county applied top dressing to more than 181,000 mu of wheat within three days. People's communes in the suburbs of Taiyuan City universally adjusted labor and livestock power after the rain, and the daily planting progress reached 50,000 mu, 25% faster than before the rain. Jinyuan People's Commune also promptly organized 1,400 commune members and 88 head of draught cattle to launch a "small spring planting" shock campaign, planting more than 2,100 mu of grain, oil crops, vegetables, and pasture crops on vacant land such as river beaches, canal banks, village sides, and house sides. The Jinan area, where cotton planting has ended, has also taken advantage of the moisture to carry out seedling inspection and replanting activities.

    河北抗旱保苗山东山西雨后抢种
    据新华社天津电　要想保丰收，首先保全苗。河北各地人民在突击抗旱播种的同时，普遍开展了查苗补苗、增墒保苗、种“预备苗”等活动，坚决保证按计划把各种作物种足种好，为实现亩产千斤粮、百斤棉、万斤薯大面积丰产打好基础。
    今年，河北各地的春播是在同严重干旱进行顽强斗争的过程中进行的。到5月1日，全省棉花播种计划已经接近完成，大田作物播种也完成近半数。由于干旱，已种的作物有的种籽落干，出不来苗，有的幼苗出土后生长不旺。为了作到保出苗、保全苗、保苗旺和保丰收，各地普遍深入检查，随查随补，作到一亩不少，一垅不断，一苗不缺。各公社还种小苗圃和“备补垅”，为补苗移栽准备足够的“预备苗”；提前锄地，多浇水、增墒保苗，使弱苗变壮苗。邯郸、石家庄两地区，已补种了八十万亩缺苗的棉田，对一百多万亩弱苗棉田也进行了“锄梦花”和浇灌，还种了大量小苗圃，在二百多万亩棉田里种上了“备补垅”，准备移栽补苗用。
    据新华社济南电　山东各地从6日到9日先后降雨，广大社员正抓住雨后大好时机突击播种。临沂地区各级领导干部纷纷深入田间，划片包干，同群众一起抢种。郯城县在抢种的同时，还开展每人种一分菜、三十棵南瓜和五十棵向日葵或蓖麻子的运动。现在，全省各地的春播工作已形成了新的高潮。
    山东省从去年遭受旱灾以后，今年又连续遭受严重春旱，受旱面积和受旱程度为数十年来未有。为了夺取今年农业大丰收，全省人民在中共山东省委和各级党委领导下，以愚公移山精神，展开了轰轰烈烈的抗旱保麦和抗旱播种运动。到5月3日止，各地已浇小麦拔节水三千多万亩，抗旱播种任务已完成55％以上。5月6日开始降雨时，中共山东省委立即召开会议，号召全省人民紧急动员起来，以大办钢铁的劲头，抓紧时机迅速完成春播任务；同时要坚定地树立长期抗旱思想，同干旱斗争到底。
    据新华社太原电　山西省在4日到8日大部地区落雨，旱象有所缓和。得雨地区正抢墒播种和加强麦田后期管理。
    平遥县委在雨未停止时，就召开了部署麦田后期管理的紧急会议，发出了“趁喜雨、狠加工，每亩超产二十斤”的战斗号召，全县五万多名社员，三天内就给十八万一千多亩小麦施了追肥。太原市郊各人民公社，雨后普遍调整了劳畜力，播种日进度达到了五万亩，比雨前加快了25％。晋源人民公社还及时组织了一千四百名社员，八十八犋耕畜，利用雨后的良机，展开了“小春播”突击运动，在河滩、渠畔、村旁、宅旁等空隙土地上播种粮食、油料、蔬菜、牧草等作物两千一百多亩。棉花播种已经结束的晋南专区，也趁墒展开了查苗补苗活动。
