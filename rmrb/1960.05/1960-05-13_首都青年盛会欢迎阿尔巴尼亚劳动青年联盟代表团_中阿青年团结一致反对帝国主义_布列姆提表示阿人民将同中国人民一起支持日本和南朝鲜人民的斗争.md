Xinhua News Agency, May 11th: A thousand young people from all walks of life in the capital held a rally tonight to warmly welcome the Albanian Labor Youth League delegation headed by Jorkia Blemti, Secretary of the Central Committee Secretariat of the Albanian Labor Youth League.

Liang Buting and Yang Haibo, Secretaries of the Central Committee Secretariat of the Communist Youth League, attended the meeting.

Zhang Jinlin, Second Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, enthusiastically praised the great achievements made by Albanian youth in building socialism under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party headed by Comrade Hoxha. He said that under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party, the heroic Albanian people and youth have waged a resolute struggle against imperialism and Yugoslav modern revisionism in order to safeguard European and world peace and to defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism. This is a major contribution made by the Albanian Labor Party, the Albanian people and youth to safeguarding world peace, consolidating the socialist camp, and uniting the international communist movement.

When talking about the current international situation, Zhang Jinlin severely condemned US imperialism for venturing to invade Soviet airspace on the eve of the summit conference. Zhang Jinlin concluded by saying, "Let us join hands closely and forge ahead courageously for the construction of socialism and communism, for the opposition of imperialism, and for the safeguarding of world peace!"

Jorkia Blemti, head of the Albanian Labor Youth League delegation and Secretary of the Central Committee Secretariat of the Albanian Labor Youth League, spoke. She said with enthusiasm, "We are proud of the great achievements made by the Chinese people in completing the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule with unprecedented enthusiasm." That is, the achievement of the entire socialist camp headed by the great Soviet Union. She said that all the achievements made by the Chinese people are due to the correct leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party and the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong.

Blemti then talked about the great achievements made by the Albanian people and youth in national construction. She said, "Naturally, these achievements will make our friends happy, because this is a great contribution to building communism and safeguarding world peace. However, the imperialists headed by the United States and their lackeys, the Yugoslav revisionists, hate our victory, but they will never be able to stop the great will of the people of all countries. Our people and youth support the just demand of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan. Our people and youth also fully support the struggle of the South Korean people together with you, and support the just struggle of the Japanese people against the Japan-US 'Security Treaty'." She said excitedly, "Let the red flag fly all over the world, communism will surely win!"

After the welcome meeting, young people, students, and literary and art workers in the capital performed wonderful literary and art programs.

    据新华社11日讯　首都各界青年一千人今晚举行集会，热烈欢迎以阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟中央委员会书记处书记约勒基亚·布列姆提为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟代表团。
    共青团中央书记处书记梁步庭、杨海波等出席了大会。
    共青团北京市委第二书记张进霖热情地赞扬阿尔巴尼亚青年在以霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党领导下建设社会主义所取得的巨大成绩后说，英勇的阿尔巴尼亚人民和青年在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党领导下，为了维护欧洲和世界和平，为了保卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，对帝国主义和南斯拉夫现代修正主义进行了坚决的斗争。这是阿尔巴尼亚劳动党、阿尔巴尼亚人民和青年对保卫世界和平、巩固社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动的团结作出的重大贡献。
    张进霖在谈到目前的国际形势时，严厉谴责美帝国主义在最高级会议举行的前夕，冒险侵犯苏联领空。张进霖最后说，让我们紧密地携起手来，为建设社会主义、共产主义，为反对帝国主义和维护世界和平而共同奋勇前进。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟代表团团长、阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟中央书记处书记约勒基亚·布列姆提讲话。她热情洋溢地说，我们为中国人民以空前的干劲提前三年完成了第二个五年计划的巨大成就感到自豪。也就是以伟大的苏联为首的整个社会主义阵营的成就。她说，中国人民所取得的这一切成就是因为有着光荣的中国共产党，有着以毛泽东同志为首的党中央委员会的正确领导。
    接着布列姆提谈到阿尔巴尼亚人民和青年在国家建设中所取得的伟大成就。她说，很自然，这些成就将使我们的朋友感到高兴，因为这是对建设共产主义、保卫世界和平的巨大贡献。而以美国为首的帝国主义和它们的仆从南斯拉夫修正主义者仇视我们的胜利，但是他们永远也阻止不住各国人民的伟大意志。我国人民和青年支持中国人民解放台湾的正当要求，我国人民和青年同样同你们一起全力支持南朝鲜人民的斗争，支持日本人民反对日美“安全条约”的正义斗争。她激动地说，让红旗飘扬在全世界，共产主义一定胜利。
    欢迎大会结束后，首都青年、学生和文艺工作者表演了精采的文艺节目。
