Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 22nd: The Kishi Nobusuke group's crime of forcibly "passing" the new "Security Treaty" in the House of Representatives has aroused increasing public anger.

The Diet Building, the American Embassy, and Kishi Nobusuke's residence are surrounded daily by tens of thousands of demonstrators demanding the resignation of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and the dissolution of the Diet.

Among the 30,000 workers who surrounded Kishi Nobusuke's residence on May 21st was Takeashita Haruo, a worker from Fuji Precision Company. He said, "We deeply believe that we will achieve victory. We have personally witnessed so many workers and others across the country fighting unitedly against the new Security Treaty, and we are very moved."

The 36-year-old machine worker said, "I will tell this to the workers who work with us, and the struggle against the new Security Treaty will definitely develop more powerfully among workers and others in our area."

Kobayashi Takao, a farmer from Yamanashi Prefecture who participated in the demonstration in front of the Diet Building on the 20th, said that farmers have been deceived by the government many times in the past, and now they will never be deceived again.

Kobayashi is 42 years old. He said, "Our lives are hard. If we only work hard to improve our lives on our own, then what we can do is limited."

He said that more and more people in the countryside are saying that we should change our government. He also said, "It makes me very happy to march arm in arm with workers in demonstrations against the government."

Also participating in the demonstration was a 36-year-old disabled veteran who lost an eye and an arm in the last war.

The veteran said, "At that time, I had a family of seven, but five died in the war." He expressed opposition to launching another war of aggression.

Among the 100,000 people who demonstrated at the Diet on May 20th to protest the forced "passage" of the new treaty in the House of Representatives was a student named Kunimatsu Akira, who said that he rushed to the Diet as soon as he heard the news of the forced "passage."

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 22nd: The Japanese people are writing to newspapers one after another, condemning the Kishi Nobusuke group's behavior of forcibly voting on the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" in the Diet. The "Mainichi Shimbun" today published many such letters of protest.

A housewife in Tokyo criticized the Kishi Nobusuke group for introducing police into the Diet to vote on the new "Security Treaty" alone, calling it dictatorial politics.

A woman named Ogawa Shizue in Tokyo condemned Kishi Nobusuke for being shameless, saying that Kishi Nobusuke must repent for his behavior during the war.

Gotō Seiko, a housewife from Zushi City, Kanagawa Prefecture, said that Kishi Nobusuke is more dangerous than a mentally ill person who commits murder and should step down immediately.

The "Tokyo Shimbun" also published letters this morning from seven readers strongly condemning the Kishi Nobusuke group's tyrannical and despicable practices.

A woman named Ito Toshiko said that she was trembling with anger when she saw the news of the Kishi Nobusuke group forcing the Diet to "pass" the new "Security Treaty." She said that she felt ashamed to think of Kishi Nobusuke, like the Syngman Rhee brothers, sitting in the seat of the Japanese Prime Minister.

    新华社22日讯　东京消息：岸信介集团在众议院强行“通过”新“安全条约”的罪行已经激起了公众愈来愈大的愤怒。
    国会大厦、美国大使馆和岸信介的住宅每天被成千上万的示威者所包围，他们要求岸信介内阁辞职并解散国会。
    在5月21日包围岸信介住宅的三万工人中，有富士精密公司的工人竹下春男。他说，“我们深信，我们将得到胜利。我们亲眼目睹全国有这么多的工人和其它的人一致为反对新安全条约而斗争，我们很受感动。”
    这位三十六岁的机器工人说，“我将把这一点告诉同我们一起工作的工人，反对新安全条约的斗争一定会在我们地区的工人和其它人中间更加有力地发展。”
    20日参加了国会大厦前的示威的山梨县农民小林孝雄说，农民们过去曾经许多次被政府欺骗，现在他们决不会再受欺骗了。
    小林今年四十二岁。他说，“我们的生活是艰苦的。如果我们只是独自努力来改善我们的生活，那么我们所能做的是有限的。”
    他说，在乡下有越来越多的人说，我们应该改换我们的政府。他又说，“同工人们臂挽臂地进行反对政府的示威游行，使我非常愉快。”
    参加示威的还有一位三十六岁的残废军人，他在上次大战中失去一只眼睛和一只手臂。
    这位退伍军人说，“那时我有家属七人，但五人都死于战争。”他表示反对再进行侵略战争。
    在5月20日到国会示威抗议在众议院强行“通过”新条约的十万名群众中有一个名叫国松昭的学生说，他听到强行“通过”的消息就直奔国会。
    新华社22日讯　东京消息：日本人民纷纷投书报纸，谴责岸信介集团在国会中强行表决新日美“安全条约”的行为。“每日新闻”今天刊载了不少的这样的抗议信。
    东京的一位家庭妇女在信里指责岸信介集团把警察导入国会单独表决新“安全条约”是独裁政治。
    东京一位名叫小川静江的妇女谴责岸信介厚颜无耻，她说，岸信介必须忏悔他在战争时期的行为。
    神奈川县逗子市的家庭妇女后藤成子说，岸信介比犯杀人罪的精神病人更危险，他应该立即下台。
    “东京新闻”今天晨刊也刊登了七名读者强烈谴责岸信介集团横暴、卑鄙作法的信件。
    一位名叫伊藤利子的妇女说，她在看到岸信介集团强使国会“通过”新“安全条约”的消息时，激愤得全身发抖。她说，想到像李承晚兄弟似的岸信介坐在日本首相席位上，她实在感到羞耻。日
