Fully Mobilize Urban Forces to Support Agricultural Production
Foshan City Enterprises Help Zhangcha Commune Basically Achieve Semi-Mechanization Within Ten Days
Zhuzhou City's Various Sectors Link Up with Suburban Communes to Plant "Experimental Fields" to Support Agriculture

	This newspaper reports that under the unified leadership of the Foshan City Committee of the Communist Party, more than sixty enterprises from the industrial transportation, capital construction, and finance and trade departments in Foshan City, Guangdong Province, with thousands of workers, adopted the method of overall planning, division of responsibilities, and phased operations. Within ten days, they helped the Zhangcha People's Commune in the suburbs basically achieve semi-mechanization and partial mechanization and electrification. Currently, the area irrigated and drained by electric machinery in this commune has increased from 70% of the paddy field area to 90%. Vehicle and boat transportation accounts for 80% of the total transportation volume. Twelve of the sixteen production brigades in the commune have electric wires installed, and nine brigades and production teams have electric lighting in canteens, offices, and other public places. Some brigades even use electricity to detect rice stem borers. Agricultural machinery factories use electric power for production, and grain and feed processing also use electric machinery. The eighteen sow farms and seventy-two canteens have all achieved self-flowing water and semi-mechanized processing. This series of technological innovation achievements is equivalent to adding 45% of the labor force to the entire commune.
	The Zhangcha People's Commune is Foshan City's non-staple food production base, located in a semi-hilly and semi-enclosed field area, prone to drought and flooding. Every year, hundreds of thousands of workdays are spent on drought resistance and drainage; due to narrow roads and rivers, relying solely on manual labor occupies 30% of the commune's labor force every day. To save labor, ensure the continuous leap forward in agriculture, and expand the production of agricultural and sideline products and industrial raw materials to meet urban needs, it is necessary to carry out agricultural technology transformation. Thanks to continuous leaps forward over the years, especially after the large-scale technological innovation campaign, industrial production in Foshan City's industrial, transportation, and other departments has basically achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization, and it also has the material and technical strength to support agricultural technology transformation. At the beginning of this year, the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee decided to designate the suburbs of Foshan as one of the province's agricultural modernization demonstration zones. The Foshan City Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to focus on the Zhangcha People's Commune as a demonstration point and decided to launch a vigorous mass movement involving the entire party and all people in mid-March to accelerate agricultural technology transformation. The city party committee and all relevant units were led by secretaries, and established organizations to support agricultural technology transformation, with clear division of labor and orderly support activities. The workers were enthusiastic and full of energy. Within ten days, they helped the Zhangcha People's Commune establish an agricultural machinery repair and assembly factory that could repair tractors and manufacture various agricultural implements. They manufactured and supplied a large number of irrigation and drainage machinery, vehicles, and meat grinders, noodle cutters, feed crushers, and other machinery to the Zhangcha Commune, and helped the commune install more than three kilometers of new power lines. To supplement the commune's technical strength, the City Wood Processing Factory also allocated a wooden farm implement workshop to the commune. In order to enable farmers to quickly master the technology, in addition to inviting farmers to the factory to learn electrical, mechanical, and driving techniques, they also organized a team of more than twenty people to go to the commune for technical guidance. The commune concentrated the carpenters, blacksmiths, and mechanics from the brigades to the commune, giving full play to the role of commune industry, vigorously carrying out tool reforms and manufacturing new machinery within its capabilities. Thanks to the joint efforts of workers and peasants, the commune quickly achieved a basically semi-mechanized victory.
	Immediately afterward, the enterprises in Foshan City, while helping the Zhangcha People's Commune to consolidate and improve its agricultural technology transformation, helped the other two communes in the suburbs to carry out technology transformation, striving to quickly achieve semi-mechanization.

	Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 3rd of May: Zhuzhou City, Hunan Province, has adopted the method of "factory contracting commune, factory and commune linking" to promote the work of industrial support for agriculture and urban support for rural areas to a new stage. At present, forty-two factories, enterprises, and finance and trade, health and other departments in the city are specifically linked to ten communes in the suburbs.
	With the strong support of urban units, coupled with their own efforts, the communes in the suburbs of Zhuzhou City have undergone great changes. All ten communes now have their own machinery factories; the commune-run grain and oil processing industry has basically achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization.
	In order to strengthen the leadership of supporting agriculture, the Municipal Party Committee established a Support Agriculture Committee, led by the secretary, established a specialized agency, and each factory and enterprise also established a Support Agriculture Leading Group, headed by the deputy secretary or deputy director, specifically leading, and from bottom to top, layer by layer, formulated plans to support agriculture. After the Xiangjiang Machinery Factory clearly contracted with the Zhutianpu Commune, Gao Xiaolian, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee, and Luo Zhenkun, Deputy Director, led engineers and engineering technicians to the Zhutianpu Commune to help the Commune formulate a plan for agricultural technology transformation, and mobilized workers in the factory to use the methods of "cleaning, squeezing, and creating" to help the Commune establish a machinery factory.
	In order to support agriculture in a timely manner, each factory also adopted the form of "long-term residence in the commune, short-term visits," sending cadres to the commune to engage in "experimental fields," to understand the commune's requirements for industry in developing production, and provide assistance based on the actual situation. For example, Badou Commune is one of the most remote places in Zhuzhou. Last year, after organizing railway, postal and telecommunications, exploration and other units to link up with the commune, the appearance quickly changed. Employees of the postal and telecommunications department helped the commune install six telephone exchanges and eighty-four telephones, achieving telephone access in every team and broadcasts everywhere; employees of the railway department designed a fifteen-kilometer simple railway for the commune, changing the original inconvenient transportation situation; the exploration department found limestone in the commune, reversing the situation that the commune had to pick up lime from forty miles away in the past.
	Driven by factories and enterprises, relevant departments in finance and trade, health, and other industries throughout the city have also set off a climax of supporting agriculture. They have all linked up with the commune and planted "experimental fields." The commercial department recently organized the supply of production materials to rural areas, more than double that of last year. In order to be timely, it also set up a round-the-clock office to handle matters as soon as they are called. The health department also organized mobile medical teams to go deep into the fields for prevention and treatment.
	Now, all walks of life, combined with the characteristics of their respective departments, specifically plan and actively support agriculture in various aspects. (Attached picture)

    充分动员城市力量支援农业生产
    佛山市各企业十天内帮助张槎公社基本实现半机械化
    株洲市各行各业同郊区公社挂钩种支援农业“试验田”
    本报讯　广东省佛山市工业交通、基本建设、财贸等部门六十多个企业，上千名职工，在市委统一领导下，采取全面规划，分工包干，分段作战的办法，在十天内，帮助郊区张槎人民公社基本上实现了半机械化和部分机械化、电气化。现在，这个公社使用电动机械排灌的面积，已从原来占禾田面积70％提高到90％。车船运输已占总运输量的80％。全社十六个生产大队已有十二个架了电线，有九个大队和生产队的食堂、办公室等公共场所已用电照明，有些大队还用电测螟。农具机械厂已用电力生产，粮食、饲料加工也采用了电动机械。十八个母猪场和七十二个食堂都实现了用水自流化、加工半机械化。这一系列的技术革新成果，等于为全社增添了45％的劳动力。
    张槎人民公社是佛山市的副食品生产基地，属于半丘陵、半围田地区，易旱易涝。每年要在抗旱排水方面花费几十万个劳动日；由于路小河窄，光靠肩挑运输，每天要占用全社30％的劳动力。为了节省劳力，保证农业持续跃进，扩大农副产品和工业原料的生产来满足城市需要，必须进行农业技术改造。佛山市工业、交通等部门由于连年不断跃进，特别是经过大闹技术革新，工业生产已经基本上实现了机械化和半机械化，也具备了支援农业技术改造的物质和技术力量。今年初，中共广东省委确定把佛山郊区作为全省农业现代化示范区之一。中共佛山市委确定以张槎人民公社作为示范重点，并且决定在3月中旬掀起一个轰轰烈烈的全党全民动手、加速农业技术改造的群众运动。市委及各有关单位都由书记挂帅，成立了支援农业技术改造的机构，分工包干，井然有序地展开支援活动。职工们个个热情充沛，干劲冲天。十天之内，他们就帮助张槎人民公社建立了一个能修理拖拉机和制造各种农具的农械修配厂，为张槎公社制造和供应了大批排灌机具、车辆，以及绞肉机、切粉机、饲料破碎机等机具，帮助公社新架了三公里多的电线。为了充实公社的技术力量，市木器加工厂还拨出一个木农具车间给公社。为了使农民迅速掌握技术，他们除邀请农民到工厂学习电器、机械和驾驶汽车等技术外，还组织了一支二十多人的队伍，到公社去作技术指导。公社则把各大队的木工、铁匠、机械工集中到公社，发挥公社工业的作用，大力进行工具改革和制造力所能及的新机具。由于工农携手并肩作战，这个公社很快就取得了基本上半机械化的胜利。
    紧接着，佛山市各企业便一面帮助张槎人民公社做好农业技术改造的巩固提高工作，一面帮助郊区其他两个公社进行技术改造，力争迅速实现半机械化。
    本报长沙3日电　湖南省株洲市采取“以厂包社、厂社挂钩”的办法，把工业支援农业、城市支援农村的工作推进到一个新的阶段。目前全市四十二个工厂、企业以及财贸、卫生等部门都与郊区十个公社具体挂上了钩。
    株洲市郊区各公社在城市各单位的大力支援下，加上本身的努力，面貌有了很大的改变。十个公社目前都有了自己的机械厂；公社办的粮油加工工业，基本上实现了机械化和半机械化。
    为了加强支援农业的领导，市委成立了支援农业委员会，由书记挂帅，成立专门机构，各工厂企业也成立了支援农业领导小组，由副书记或副厂长负责，具体领导，并从下到上，层层制定了支援农业的规划。湘江机器厂明确包朱田铺公社以后，党委副书记高孝廉、副厂长罗振坤带领工程师和工程技术人员到朱田铺公社，帮助公社制订农业技术改造规划，并在厂里发动职工用“清、挤、造”的办法，帮助公社建立了一个机械厂。
    为了及时支援农业，各工厂还采取“长期住社、短期访问”的形式，派干部经常深入公社搞“试验田”，了解社里在发展生产时对工业的要求，根据实际情况，给予援助。如八斗公社是株洲一个最偏僻的地方，去年组织了铁路、邮电、勘探等单位与该社挂钩后，面貌迅速改变。邮电部门职工帮助这个社安装了六台电话总机，八十四部电话机，已作到队队有电话、处处有广播；铁路部门职工为这个社设计了一条十五公里的简易铁路，改变了原有交通不方便的状况；勘探部门在这个社找到了石灰石，扭转了这个社过去要到四十里以外去挑石灰的局面。
    在工厂企业的带动下，全市财贸、卫生等各行各业有关部门，也掀起了支援农业的高潮。他们纷纷与公社挂钩，种“试验田”。商业部门最近组织了比去年多一倍的生产资料供应农村，为了做到及时，还设立了通宵办公室，随叫随办。卫生部门也组织了巡回医疗队，深入田间，进行防治。
    现在各行各业结合本部门的特点，具体规划，主动从各方面支援农业。（附图片）
