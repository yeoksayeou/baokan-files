Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 28th. News: As the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle develops, the "anti-mainstream faction" and bourgeois public opinion within Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) are demanding the resignation of the notorious Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, holding him responsible for the chaotic political situation caused by dispatching police to forcibly pass the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" in the House of Representatives.

According to a report in today's "Asahi Shimbun," Liberal Democratic Party "anti-mainstream faction" leaders Tanzan Ishibashi, Takeo Miki, Kenzō Matsumura, and Ichiro Kono demanded Kishi's resignation at a meeting of leaders of various factions within the ruling party on the 27th.

This meeting was convened by the LDP Vice President Banboku Ōno in order to "clean up the political situation." Those who attended the meeting also included Hayato Ikeda and Nobusuke Kishi's confidants Masajiro Kawashima and Eisaku Satō.

The "Asahi Shimbun" stated that Ichiro Kono criticized the measures currently being taken by the Kishi government at the meeting, saying they would make the Japanese political situation even more serious. Takeo Miki expressed his agreement with Kono's opinion. Kono and Miki also pointed out that Kishi should admit his mistakes in forcing a vote on the new "Security Treaty" in the House of Representatives. Kono pointed out that Kishi should bear full responsibility for the current serious situation and step down.

Tanzan Ishibashi emphasized at the meeting that Kishi must step down immediately. Kenzō Matsumura expressed his agreement with the opinions of Kono and Miki.

According to reports, the "anti-mainstream faction" and the "mainstream faction" within the Liberal Democratic Party engaged in a debate at the meeting. Today's Tokyo newspapers unanimously believe that this meeting will intensify the opposition between the "anti-mainstream faction" and the "mainstream faction," and further exacerbate the internal chaos within the ruling Japanese party.

According to today's "Mainichi Shimbun," LDP Secretary-General Masajiro Kawashima once again requested a donation of 100 million yen from the Japanese monopoly capital groups on the 23rd to be used by the Kishi government to promote the new "Security Treaty," but was rejected by Kogoro Uemura, Vice President of the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations.

The "Mainichi Shimbun" stated that recently, due to the fierce criticism of Nobusuke Kishi by Japanese public opinion, coupled with internal divisions within the Liberal Democratic Party, the monopoly capital groups, which had always supported the ratification of the new "Security Treaty," have also begun to criticize Kishi. They believe that in order to unify the Liberal Democratic Party internally, it is necessary to urge Kishi not to run for the next LDP presidency.

    随着日本人民爱国正义斗争的发展
    日本执政党内倒岸声浪日高
    “反主流派”领袖石桥、三木、松村、河野要求岸信介下台
    新华社28日讯　东京消息：日本自由民主党“反主流派”和资产阶级舆论都在要求声名狼藉的岸信介首相下台，要他对由于出动警察强迫众议院通过新日美“安全条约”而引起的混乱政局承担责任。
    据“朝日新闻”今天报道，自由民主党“反主流派”领袖石桥湛山、三木武夫、松村谦三和河野一郎27日在执政党各派领袖会谈时要求岸信介下台。
    这次会谈是自由民主党副总裁大野伴睦为了“收拾政局”而召集的。出席会谈的还有池田勇人和岸信介的亲信川岛正次郎、佐藤荣作。
      “朝日新闻”说，河野一郎在会上指责岸信介政府目前所采取的措施将使日本政局更加严重，三木武夫表示赞同河野的意见。河野和三木还指出岸信介要对在众议院把新“安全条约”强行付诸表决的作法承认错误。河野指出，岸信介对目前的严重形势应当承担全部责任，并且下台。
    石桥湛山在会上强调说，岸信介必须立即下台。松村谦三表示同意河野和三木的意见。
    据报道，自由民主党内“反主流派”和“主流派”在会上展开了争论。今天的东京各报一致认为，这次会谈将使“反主流派”和“主流派”之间的对立更加剧烈、日本执政党内部更加混乱。
    据“每日新闻”今天报道，自由民主党干事长川岛正次郎23日再一次请求日本垄断资本集团捐款一亿日元给岸信介政府充当宣传新“安全条约”的费用，但是遭到了日本经济团体联合会副会长植村甲午郎的拒绝。
    “每日新闻”说，最近以来，由于日本社会舆论猛烈抨击岸信介，加以自由民主党内部意见分歧，一直支持批准新“安全条约”的垄断资本集团也开始批评岸信介。他们认为，要使自由民主党内部统一，必须促使岸信介不再竞选下届自由民主党总裁。
