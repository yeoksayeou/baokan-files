Jiangxi

Xinhua News Agency reports: In order to overcome the adverse conditions brought about by cold waves and overcast rainy weather, Jiangxi is actively carrying out field management work while rushing to transplant early rice. At present, more than 20 million mu of early rice have been transplanted in the province, and a high tide of field management activities has been formed. In areas such as Southern Jiangxi, Fuzhou, and Shangrao, where early rice transplanting is progressing rapidly, more than 2 million commune members are checking seedlings, replenishing gaps, weeding, and topdressing every day.

This year, Jiangxi Province has been hit by seven cold waves in succession from early rice seed soaking and sowing to the current transplanting, and continuous overcast rain has lasted for more than a month. Therefore, the seedlings are growing slowly, and the transplanting time is generally delayed by seven to ten days compared with previous years. Based on this situation, Party committees at all levels issued calls to the broad masses of commune members at the very beginning of early rice transplanting, requiring all localities to plant and manage simultaneously, and manage each plot as it is transplanted. In order to promote the rapid revival of seedlings, commune members started to apply fast-acting fertilizers during transplanting.

Guangdong

Xinhua News Agency reports: In response to the two weaknesses of early rice, which have been historically characterized by less tillering and easy lodging, Guangdong Province is attacking tillering early and preventing lodging early in field management. Throughout the province, early rice has generally undergone seedling checking, gap filling, and the first round of cultivation and topdressing. More than one-third of the paddy fields have undergone the second and third rounds of cultivation and topdressing, with an average of 20 to 30 dan of fertilizer applied per mu. Most paddy fields have implemented rational irrigation and drainage techniques.

Guangdong's early rice has a relatively short growing period and is often subject to typhoons and rainstorms during the ripening period. Therefore, it suffers from less tillering, easy lodging, and unstable production. This year, the province first achieved the plan of transplanting early rice basically before the Qingming Festival in a timely manner, creating extremely favorable conditions for extending the growing period, promoting more tillering, and preventing lodging.

To achieve the goals of more tillering and lodging prevention, the most important key lies in rational fertilization and rational irrigation and drainage. Many communes in the Foshan area, based on the needs of each growth stage of rice, implement the fertilization principle of applying more when there is a greater deficiency, applying less when there is a lesser deficiency, applying comprehensively when there is a general deficiency, and focusing on applications when there is a local deficiency. In order to achieve a higher standard of rational fertilization and maximize the effectiveness of the applied fertilizer, many communes throughout the province also adopt a fertilization method that combines scattering, strip application, and spot application.

Zhejiang

Xinhua News Agency reports: Zhejiang Province has completed the transplanting of more than 12 million mu of the first batch of early rice before "Lixia" (May 5th). The broad masses of commune members immediately invested in field management work, taking advantage of the victory to vigorously attack the early development of early rice. At present, areas such as Wenzhou, Jinhua, and Ningbo are fully unfolding work such as weeding, fertilizing, and irrigating. Most of the early rice has already been weeded once and topdressed once. More than 100 communes and more than 6,000 production teams in the Ningbo area have established mutual partnerships between communes and teams after completing transplanting, and are enthusiastically carrying out high-standard cultivation management competitions.

In Zhejiang Province, early rice transplanted in green manure fields, winter fallow fields, and early-maturing spring flower crop fields is called the first batch of early rice; early rice transplanted in late-maturing spring flower crop fields is called the second batch. The proportion of the first batch of early rice in the total early rice area is very large, and the quality of the harvest has a great impact on the province's annual grain output. This year, the planting area of the first batch of early rice in the province has expanded by 1.16 million mu compared with last year, and the quality of transplanting is good. At present, people's communes in various places are organizing commune members to do a good job in the field management of the first batch of early rice, and are also drawing some manpower to harvest spring flower crops and rush to transplant the second batch of early rice.

Jiangsu

Xinhua News Agency reports: In Jiangsu Province, the sowing quality of spring-sown crops led by early rice, early corn, and early sweet potatoes is better than in previous years. Based on the spirit of planting and managing simultaneously, and managing as soon as planted, various localities have taken a series of organizational and technical measures, and while planting well, they have set off a surge of management.

In the Lixiahe area, which has a large area of early rice, every effort is made to emulate the management of rice in the Jiangnan region, with management measures being implemented rigorously and every step being tightly linked. In the Yancheng area, all "Little Jiangnan" seedling fields are implementing all measures in advance, with every step of work leading the way, managing the seedlings as carefully as embroidery.

This year, there was more rain in early spring, and the soil moisture content was good, so the corn emerged quickly and uniformly after sowing. At present, various localities are seizing the opportunity to loosen the soil promptly after rain and carrying out field management activities centered on ensuring full and strong seedlings, with a focus on pest control.

Guangxi

Xinhua News Agency reports: This spring, Guangxi reclaimed 10 million mu of new land, and the early rice area has been expanded by more than 1 million mu compared with last year. The corn area has been expanded by nearly doubled, and the planting area of miscellaneous grains such as cassava and cat bean has increased compared with previous years. At present, people's communes in various localities are taking fertilizer as the lead in field management and strengthening field management.

In the work of accumulating fertilizer, various localities have adopted a method that combines professional teams for fertilizer accumulation and a mass shock campaign, preparing a large amount of topdressing fertilizer for spring-sown crops in a short period of time. The Nanning area invested a total of 260,000 people in professional fertilizer accumulation teams.

In field management work, Guangxi has placed great emphasis on the effective experience of "grasping both ends, leading the middle" to achieve balanced production increases. More than 200,000 cadres dispatched to the countryside have been divided into two groups, one group going to advanced, high-yield areas, and the other group going to backward, low-yield areas, strengthening the leadership force at "both ends." In the Wuzhou and Yulin areas, each commune has established a clear contrast between low-yield and high-yield paddy fields, vigorously launching a "five catch-up" movement to make mountain slopes catch up with plains, lean fields catch up with fertile fields, distant fields catch up with near fields, seedling fields catch up with main fields, and late-transplanted fields catch up with early-transplanted fields. They are also widely carrying out over-production contracting competitions, vigorously attacking three types of rice, and striving for a high-yield and bumper harvest of early rice.

Fujian

This newspaper reports: In areas of Fujian Province that have completed early rice transplanting, cadres are leading field management professional teams to carry out field management activities centered on accumulating fertilizer, topdressing, cultivating, and weeding. In the Longxi, Jinjiang, and Nanping areas alone, more than 20 counties have recently established more than 13,900 field management professional teams, dividing areas and sections for dedicated management.

This year, the area of high-yield early rice fields in Fujian Province will be about 3 million mu. Xianyou County has established high-yield competition command posts from the county to the commune and brigade levels, with Party organization leaders and cadre participation at each level. The broad masses of cadres led high-yield professional teams, establishing experimental fields accounting for more than 60% of the total early rice area, setting off a large-scale high-yield competition of "early rice surpassing late rice" and "producing 1,000 jin per mu in one season" throughout the county. Zhouning County launched a "one-stop" high-yield competition campaign, with all departments in the county going deep into the front line of production, participating in production, leading production, and supporting production. In this way, not only are the broad masses of people organized in a larger-scale high-yield competition upsurge, but the mutual cooperation of industrial, commercial, transportation, and scientific and technological departments serving agricultural production is further brought into play.

    江西
    据新华社讯为了战胜寒潮、阴雨带来的不利条件，江西各地在抢插早稻的同时，积极开展田间管理工作。目前，全省已插早稻二千多万亩，田间管理运动也已形成高潮。赣南、抚州、上饶等季节早插秧进度快的地区，每天都有二百多万社员在查苗补兜、耘禾追肥。
    今年江西省从早稻浸种、播种直到目前插秧，连续遭受到七次寒潮侵袭，连绵的阴雨持续了一个多月，因此秧苗长得较慢，插秧时间一般比往年推迟了七到十天。根据这个情况，各地党委在早稻插秧刚一开始，就向广大社员发出号召，要求各地边插边管、插一丘管一丘。为了促使秧苗迅速返青，社员们在插秧时就着手追施速效肥料。
    广东
    据新华社讯广东省针对历年来早稻少分蘖、易倒伏的两个薄弱环节，在田间管理中早攻分蘖，早防倒伏。全省早稻现在已普遍经过查苗补苗和第一次中耕追肥，有三分之一以上的稻田并已第二次和第三次中耕追肥，每亩一般追肥二、三十担。大多数稻田都推行了合理排灌的技术措施。
    广东的早稻由于生长期较短，成熟期又常遇暴风雨侵袭，因此，存在着少分蘖、易倒伏、生产不稳定的情况。今年全省首先实现了适时提早在清明节基本栽插完早稻的计划，为延长生长期、多分蘖、防倒伏创造了极为有利的条件。
    要达到多分蘖和防倒伏的目的，最主要的关键在于合理施肥和合理排灌。佛山专区许多公社根据水稻各个生长期的需要，贯彻多缺多施，少缺少施，普遍缺全面施，局部缺重点施的施肥原则。全省许多公社为了做到更高标准的合理施肥，使施下的肥料发挥应有的效益，还采用撒施、条施、点施相结合的施肥法。
    浙江
    据新华社讯浙江省一千二百多万亩首批早稻已在“立夏”（5日）前全部插完。广大社员随即投入了田间管理工作，乘胜猛攻早稻早发关。现在，温州、金华、宁波等专区正在全面展开耘田、施肥、灌水等工作，大部分早稻已经耘了一遍，追施了一次肥料。宁波专区一百多个公社、六千多个生产队在完成插秧后，社与社、队与队相互挂钩，热烈开展高标准培育管理竞赛。
    浙江省插在绿肥田、冬闲田和早熟春花作物田上的早稻叫作首批早稻；插在晚熟春花作物田上的早稻叫第二批。首批早稻占全部早稻面积的比重很大，收成好否对全省全年粮食产量影响很大。今年，全省首批早稻栽插面积，比去年扩大一百一十六万亩，插秧质量良好。目前，各地人民公社在组织社员做好首批早稻田间管理工作的同时，并抽出一部分人力收割春花作物和抢插第二批早稻。
    江苏
    据新华社讯江苏省以早稻、早玉米、早红薯“三早”带头的春播作物的播种质量都比往年好，各地本着边种边管、一种就管的精神，采取一系列的组织措施和技术措施，在种好的同时掀起了管理的热潮。
    早稻面积较大的里下河地区，处处以江南管理水稻为榜样，管理措施一着不让，环环扣紧。盐城专区所有的“小江南”秧田，样样措施先行，步步工作领先，描龙绣凤般管好秧苗。
    今年早春雨水较多，墒情好，玉米播后出苗快而整齐。目前各地正抓紧雨后及时松土，开展以全苗壮苗为中心、以防治虫害为重点的田间管理运动。
    广西
    据新华社讯今春，广西新开荒一千万亩，早稻比去年扩大一百多万亩，玉米扩大了将近一倍，木薯、猫豆等杂粮的种植面积都比往年增多。现在各地人民公社在田间管理中，都以肥为帅，加强田间管理。
    各地在积肥工作中，采取了专业队积肥和全民突击相结合的方法，短期内为春播作物准备了大量追肥。南宁专区投入积肥的专业队伍共达二十六万人。
    广西各地在田间管理工作中，十分强调“抓两头，带中间”这一夺取平衡增产的有效经验。下放到农村的二十多万名干部，兵分两路，一部分到先进、高产地区，一部分到后进、低产地区，加强“两头”的领导力量。梧州和玉林专区各公社在低产和高产田垌之间，树立了鲜明的对立面，大张旗鼓地掀起山冲赶平原、瘦田赶肥田、远田赶近田、秧田赶本田、迟插田赶早插田的“五赶”运动，广泛开展超包产竞赛，猛攻三类禾，力争早稻高产丰收。
    福建
    本报讯　福建省已经完成早稻插秧的地区，由干部带领田间管理专业队，开展以积肥追肥中耕除草等为中心的田间管理运动。仅龙溪、晋江和南平三个专区二十多个县，最近就建立起田间管理专业队一万三千九百多个，分区分片专责管理。
    今年福建省早稻丰产田面积将有三百万亩左右。仙游县从县到公社、大队层层建立起党组织负责干部参加的丰产竞赛指挥部。广大干部带领丰产专业队，建立了占早稻总面积的60％多的丰产片试验田，在全县范围内掀起“早稻超晚稻”和“一季产千斤”的丰产大竞赛。周宁县开展了“一条龙”丰产竞赛运动，全县各部门都深入生产第一线，参加生产、领导生产、支援生产。这样，不仅把广大群众组织在更大规模的丰产竞赛热潮中，而且进一步发挥了工、商、交通、科学技术部门互相协作，为农业生产服务。
