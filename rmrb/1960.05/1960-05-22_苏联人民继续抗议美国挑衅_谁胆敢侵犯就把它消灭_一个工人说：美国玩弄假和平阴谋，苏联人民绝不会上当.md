Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 20th. The Soviet people's tide of anger against the provocative acts of American imperialism is surging, and angry voices condemning the instigators of war continue to be heard throughout the country.

    Moscow writers held a protest meeting at the Central House of Literature Workers on the 18th. Soviet Writers' Union Secretary Surkov, writers Golubov, Smirnov, and others spoke at the meeting, unanimously condemning the American war provocateurs with anger.

    Moscow "Dynamo" factory lathe operator Kor. Fu said that it seems that the American imperialists want to do this: hold a bomb in one hand and sign a peace treaty with the other. This trick will not succeed. Our tested people will not be fooled.

    People from all walks of life in Leningrad held a mass meeting at the Palace of Culture on the 19th. Socialist Labor Hero, excavator worker Kukin of the construction company, angrily condemned the provocative actions of the United States at the meeting.

    Smirnov, the president of the Leningrad Institute of Technology, said in his speech that Eisenhower, Nixon, and other American leaders have obviously forgotten that they are dealing with the powerful Soviet people. They have forgotten that the era of plundering colonies is gone forever.

    Kiev driving instructor Veselov said at a workers' meeting at the "Kiev Passenger Car" motorcade that American leaders want to evade responsibility and describe the infuriating international provocation as an "insignificant event" and a "trivial matter." He also said that if enemy planes fly into Soviet airspace again, we will still shoot them down.

    "We unanimously support the statement of the head of the Soviet government!" "Let the provocateurs know how powerful we are!" "We are always ready to use rockets to counterattack aerial bandits" - this is the common roar from mass rallies in cities and villages throughout the Georgian Republic.

    A unit of rocket forces in Sverdlovsk, which shot down the American aerial bandit, held a meeting on the 19th to accept medals and awards presented by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. Major Voronov, who was awarded the Red Banner Medal, said at the meeting that the Soviet people have given us powerful weapons, and we safely defend the creative labor and peaceful life of the Soviet people. Anyone who dares to violate the Soviet border will be immediately eliminated. The Soviet rocket forces, like other combat forces in the Soviet Union, will continue to improve their combat skills.

    苏联人民继续抗议美国挑衅

    一个工人说：美国玩弄假和平阴谋，苏联人民绝不会上当
    据新华社莫斯科20日电　苏联人民抗议美帝国主义挑衅行为的怒潮汹涌澎湃，全国各地继续发出愤怒谴责战争挑拨者的吼声。
    莫斯科的作家们18日在中央文学工作者之家举行抗议集会。苏联作家协会书记苏尔科夫、作家戈鲁鲍夫、斯米尔诺夫等在讲话中都一致愤怒谴责美国战争挑衅者。
    莫斯科“狄纳莫”工厂的车工科尔?夫说，看来，美帝国主义者想这样来干：一只手拿着炸弹，另一只手签署和平条约。这种诡计是不能得逞的。我们久经考验的人民是不会上当的。
    列宁格勒市各界人民19日在文化宫举行群众集会。社会主义劳动英雄、建筑公司掘土机工人库金在会上愤怒谴责美国的挑衅行径。
    列宁格勒工学院院长斯米尔诺夫在讲话中说，艾森豪威尔、尼克松和美国其他领导人显然忘记了他们是在同强大的苏联人民打交道。他们忘记了掠夺殖民地的时代已经一去不复返了。
    基辅的司机教练维谢洛夫在“基辅客车”机务段的工人集会上说，美国领导人想要逃避责任，把令人愤怒的国际挑衅事件说成是“无关紧要的事件”，是“小事情”。他又说，如果敌机再到苏联领空飞行，我们仍然要把它击落。
    “我们一致支持苏联政府首脑的声明！”“让挑衅者知道一下我们的厉害！”“我们随时准备用火箭迎击空中强盗”——这是格鲁吉亚共和国广大城市和乡村的群众集会上发出的共同吼声。
    打下美国空中强盗的斯维德洛夫斯克的火箭部队某部19日举行了接受苏联最高苏维埃主席团颁发的勋章和奖章的集会。荣获红旗勋章的沃罗诺夫少校在会上说，苏联人民交给了我们强有力的武器，我们安全地保卫着苏联人民的创造性劳动和和平生活。任何胆敢侵犯苏联国境的人都将立即被消灭。苏联火箭部队和苏联其他战斗部队一样，将继续提高自己的战斗素养。
