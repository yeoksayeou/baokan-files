Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 12th dispatch: The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) and the Federation of Independent Unions' 4.6 million workers held short general strikes successively across the country today, and held rallies, resolutely opposing the Diet's ratification of the new "Security Treaty", demanding the resignation of the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet and the dissolution of the Diet.

The workers also expressed their support for the Miike coal miners in today's action.

In Fukuoka Prefecture, Niigata Prefecture, and Hokkaido, all workers of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan and the Federation of Independent Unions participated in the strike. At many rallies, union leaders, Socialist Party or Communist Party leaders, in their speeches, specifically mentioned the great rally of the Chinese people in Beijing against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. The workers cheered upon hearing this news.

Almost all rallies expressed anger at the U.S. U-2 jet's intelligence gathering flights in Soviet airspace.

Various mass rallies also passed resolutions, expressing the workers' determination to continue the struggle until they victoriously prevent the Diet's plan to ratify the new "Security Treaty" and shatter the conspiracies of U.S. imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries against peace.

Many mass rallies delivered protest telegrams and letters to the Nobusuke Kishi government. Many mass rallies also passed letters written to the Socialist Party and the Communist Party. The letters expressed support for the activities of these parties and demanded that they not relax their efforts to prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty".

Mass rallies in various locations elected representatives to participate in the large-scale petition to the Diet on May 14. After discussions, these mass rallies also established strike committees, authorizing it to prepare for large-scale political strikes after May 20. At the same time, the joint struggle organizations against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" in various localities have increased to two thousand. They have launched various forms of protest actions in various places, mobilizing ordinary citizens, youth, women, students, and farmers to participate in this struggle. These actions include holding mass rallies, launching propaganda campaigns, and petition drives. In Hyogo Prefecture, six hundred merchants went on strike for a whole day to express their opposition to the ratification of the new "Security Treaty".

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 12th dispatch: Today, five thousand citizens in Tokyo held a rally and went to the Diet to submit petitions against the ratification of the new "Security Treaty".

This action, initiated by the Tokyo Metropolitan Joint Struggle Conference for Peace and Democracy, is the first wave of large-scale petitions to the Diet during the 16th National Unified Action of the Japanese people against the ratification of the new "Security Treaty". According to the unified action plan, the Japanese people will conduct a large-scale petition to the Diet by 100,000 people on the 14th.

Before they went to the Diet, the petitioners, carrying flags, held a mass rally in front of the Diet building. Shigeo Kamiyama, a member of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, emphasized in his speech at the rally that the grand mass rally held in Beijing to support the Japanese people's struggle against the new "Security Treaty" has great significance, it shows that the Japanese people are not isolated in their struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. He emphasized that the Japanese people's struggle against the new "Security Treaty" will surely be victorious because this struggle has the strong support of the people of the world. At this time, a storm of applause resounded among the petitioners, expressing support for Kamiyama's words.

Kamiyama continued, saying that U.S. imperialists feel very uneasy due to Khrushchev's exposure of American espionage activities. Kamiyama said that because of this exposure, Nobusuke Kishi has had to use such a strange argument, saying that the U-2 jet stationed in Japan "is not engaged in intelligence activities." Kamiyama said that this shows how isolated Nobusuke Kishi is in trying to force the Diet to pass the new "Security Treaty". Kamiyama said, "U.S. imperialists are nothing more than a paper tiger in the face of the powerful solidarity action currently expanding in Japan, South Korea, South Vietnam, or Turkey."

Hideo Yamahana, a Socialist Party Diet member, revealed that the Nobusuke Kishi government and the Liberal Democratic Party are currently planning to force the Diet to pass the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" around May 17.

Yamahana expressed the Socialist Party's determination to prevent this conspiracy from succeeding. He said that the Socialist Party will convene a meeting of leaders of party organizations in various prefectures on May 15, and on May 17 call on all Socialist Party Diet members to oppose the Liberal Democratic Party's forced passage of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty".

    反对日美军事同盟的第十六次统一行动大规模展开 
    日本四百六十万工人大罢工
    东京五千市民举行大会向国会请愿
    新华社12日讯　东京消息：日本工会总评议会和中立工会联合会的四百六十万工人今天在全国先后举行短时间的大罢工，并举行集会，坚决反对国会批准新“安全条约”，要求岸信介内阁辞职和解散国会。
    工人们还在今天的行动中表示他们对三池煤矿工人的支持。
    在福冈县、新潟县以及北海道，日本工会总评议会和中立工会的全部工人都参加了罢工。在许多集会上，工会领袖、社会党或共产党领袖在他们的演说中，都特别谈到了中国人民在北京举行的反对美日军事同盟条约的伟大集会。工人们听到这个消息后都欢呼起来。
    几乎所有的集会都对美国U—2型喷气式飞机在苏联领空进行搜集情报的飞行表示愤怒。
    各个群众集会还都通过决议，表示工人们决心继续斗争，直到他们胜利地阻止了国会批准新“安全条约”的计划，粉碎了美帝国主义和日本反动派对和平的阴谋时为止。
    许多群众大会把抗议电报和抗议信交给岸信介政府。许多群众大会还通过写给社会党和共产党的信。信中表示支持这些政党的活动，并且要求他们不要放松努力以阻止批准新“安全条约”。
    各地群众大会都选出代表去参加将在5月14日向国会进行的大规模请愿。这些群众大会经过讨论后还成立了罢工委员会，授权它准备在5月20日以后举行大规模的政治罢工。同时，各地方反对日美“安全条约”的共同斗争组织已经增加到两千个。它们在各地展开了各种形式的抗议行动，动员普通市民、青年、妇女、学生和农民参加这一斗争。这些行动包括召开群众大会，展开宣传运动和签名运动。兵库县有六百名商人罢市一整天，表示反对批准新“安全条约”。
    新华社12日讯　东京消息：今天东京有五千名市民举行大会，并到国会去递交了反对批准新“安全条约”的请愿书。
    东京都维护和平与民主共同斗争会议发起的这个行动，是日本人民第十六次反对批准新“安全条约”全国统一行动期间向国会大规模请愿的第一个浪潮。按照统一行动计划，日本人民将在14日向国会进行十万人的大规模请愿。
    在他们到国会去之前，打着旗子的请愿者在国会大厦前举行了群众大会。日本共产党中央委员会委员神山茂夫在大会上讲话时强调指出，为了支持日本人民反对新“安全条约”的斗争而在北京举行的盛大的群众大会有重大意义，它表明日本人民在反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争中不是孤立的。他强调说，日本人民反对新“安全条约”的斗争必将获得胜利，因为这场斗争受到世界人民的有力支持。这时在请愿者中间响起了暴风雨般的掌声，表示支持神山茂夫的话。
    神山接着说，由于赫鲁晓夫揭露了美国的间谍行动，美帝国主义者感到十分不安。神山说，由于这种揭露，岸信介已不得不使用这种奇怪的论调，说什么驻在日本的U—2型喷气式飞机“不是从事于情报活动的”。神山说，这表明，岸信介在企图强使国会通过新“安全条约”时是多么孤立。神山说，“美帝国主义者在日本、南朝鲜、南越或土耳其目前正在扩大的强大的团结行动面前只不过是一只纸猫。”
    社会党国会议员山花秀雄揭露说，岸信介政府和自由民主党目前计划在5月17日左右强使国会通过新日美“安全条约”。
    山花表示社会党决心阻止这个阴谋得逞。他说，社会党将在5月15日召开各县党组织领导人会议，并在5月17日号召社会党全体国会议员来反对自由民主党强行通过新日美“安全条约”。
