    A Miniature of the Technical Revolution Movement
    ——Watching the Documentary "Red Flowers of Innovation Bloom Everywhere"
    Ji Feng
    At present, technical innovation and the technical revolution have formed a nationwide production revolution movement in our country. The Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio's documentary special "Red Flowers of Innovation Bloom Everywhere" is a miniature of this great movement, showing a scene of everyone innovating, everything innovating, and every industry innovating, leaping forward and then leaping forward again with great enthusiasm. The film introduces us to the appearance and scale of technical innovation and technical revolution across the country.
    In the twist drill workshop of the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory, there used to be sixteen people per shift, producing 330,000 pieces per year. Since the realization of the automatic production line, the equipment has been reduced by five units, with three people per shift, and the annual output is 2.7 million pieces. In the Jin Cheng Hardware Factory in Harbin, during this technical revolution movement, the leadership, workers, and technicians of the hairpin and thimble workshop combined to create six automatic production lines, realizing full automation, increasing efficiency by 33 times, and increasing production by 52 times. The soft shaft workshop of the Harbin Electric Meter Instrument Factory originally had forty-two people. After the realization of two automatic production lines, only two people were needed. While production efficiency has increased, physical labor has also been greatly reduced. In the past, Tianjin dockworkers relied entirely on their shoulders to carry goods. After vigorously engaging in the technical revolution, automatic loading and unloading lines were realized, and the workers were liberated from heavy physical labor. At the Shanghai Huaguang Match Factory, when operating manually, more than a dozen actions were required to pack a pack of matches. A worker working eight hours a day had to make more than 40,000 continuous movements. Now, with technical innovation, the mechanization of match packaging has been achieved. The Harbin Bristle Factory had never had any machinery in its 108-year history. All processes such as root cleaning, bundling, and fluffing were done manually. After liberation, the Party repeatedly improved the workers' working conditions, but because the workers were engaged in manual labor year after year, many workers still suffered from finger joint pain. After this technical revolution, production automation was achieved, completely freeing the hands. Now, workers who have been freed from heavy physical labor and tedious manual operations have become workers who manage machines, and some only need to press buttons at the console to operate production.
    Technical innovation and technical revolution are guided by the Party's policy of walking on two legs, combining indigenous and foreign methods, mainly relying on the masses to be self-reliant, using indigenous methods, and creating indigenous equipment to achieve them. The mechanization of loading and unloading in Tianjin and the mechanization of packaging in Shanghai introduced in the film were all realized by workers collecting materials from scrap piles, designing them themselves, and creating them themselves. The national red banner unit, Kaifeng Machinery Factory in Henan, in order to produce 800 combine harvesters this year, made their own steel presses because they did not have steel; because they did not have large motors, they cleverly used eight small motors to drive a large generator, etc.
    In the technical revolution movement, people's spiritual outlook has undergone extremely profound changes. Under the leadership of the Party and guided by Chairman Mao's thought on continuous revolution and the theory of revolutionary development stages, the broad masses have further enhanced their understanding, broken superstitions, liberated their minds, and vigorously engaged in technical innovation and technical revolution with soaring energy and revolutionary perseverance, and their style is even higher. Like the Kaifeng Machinery Factory introduced in the film, after the call of the Party committee, more than 100 technical innovations were made in just one day and night, bringing many backward processes onto the path of mechanization and automation. Punch press worker Wang Benzhen has already been doing the work for 1972 because he created the universal punch press. At the Harbin Bristle Factory, some people originally said: bristle production is a manual industry that will last for ten thousand years. Others can make great leaps forward, but we can only make small improvements. Under the leadership of the Party, after this vigorous technical innovation, their minds were thoroughly liberated, and continuous mechanical and automated production was achieved in 108 days, ending the factory's 108-year history of manual bristle production. Old worker Li Shaoyou was inspired by the switch of an umbrella and created an automatic clip and combing machine for "bundling." Worker Liu Zheng, with the support of the Party and the assistance of his comrades, failed in his experiments more than a thousand times, but finally succeeded in creating a bristle grading machine. From this, it can also be seen that the technical revolution movement has greatly promoted the intellectualization of the working masses.
    "Red Flowers of Innovation Bloom Everywhere" is a special feature consisting of five short films, but they have a common feature in their artistic expression, that is, they mostly adopt a clear contrast method, clearly explaining the necessity of innovation and vividly showing the effect of innovation. Although it reflects technical issues, it makes it easy for people to understand. At the same time, when showing the innovation process, it also endows the film with certain science and education properties for exchanging experiences, making it highly enlightening. Because this film comprehensively summarizes the current vigorous technical innovation and technical revolution movement, shows the new style of the broad masses of working people who have lofty aspirations and great ambitions, and specifically introduces many innovations and creations, and all of this is embodied in an artistic form that is easily accepted by the masses, the release of this film will further encourage the masses' pioneering spirit and promote the technical innovation and technical revolution movement.

    技术革命运动的缩影
    ——看纪录片“革新花开遍地红”
    冀风
    目前，技术革新和技术革命已经在我国形成全民性的生产革命运动。中央新闻纪录电影制片厂纪录片特辑“革新花开遍地红”就是这一伟大运动的一个缩影，表现出人人革新，事事革新，行行革新的热气腾腾的跃进再跃进的局面。影片向我们介绍了全国各地技术革新和技术革命的面貌和规模。
    哈尔滨量具刃具厂生产丝锥的车间，过去每班十六个人，年产三十三万件，自从实现了生产自动线，设备减少五台，三个人一班，年产二百七十万件。哈尔滨金城五金工厂，在这次技术革命运动中，制造头发卡子和顶针的车间，领导、工人和技术人员三结合，创造了六条生产自动线，实现了全盘自动化，提高工效三十三倍，生产量提高了五十二倍。哈尔滨电表仪器厂软轴车间原来是四十二个人，实现了两条生产自动线之后，只需要两个人就足够了。与生产效率提高的同时，体力劳动也大大地减轻了。过去，天津装卸工人，全靠肩膀扛，大闹技术革命以后，实现了装卸自动线，工人们就从笨重的体力劳动中解放出来了。上海华光火柴厂，手工操作时，包一包火柴，要作十几个动作，一个工人一天工作八小时，就得连续不断地作四万多个动作。现在技术革新，实现了火柴包装机械化。哈尔滨猪鬃厂，建厂一百零八年以来，从来没有任何机器，清根、整把、梳绒等全部过程都是手工操作。解放后，党一再改善了工人们的劳动条件，但是，由于工人们常年的手工操作，仍有不少工人害指节疼痛病。经过这次技术革命，实现了生产自动化，彻底解放了双手。如今摆脱了笨重的体力劳动和繁琐的手工操作的工人，都变成了管理机器的工人，有的甚至只要在操纵台前按按电钮来操纵生产。
    技术革新和技术革命，是在党的两条腿走路的方针指导下，土洋结合，主要依靠广大群众自力更生，运用土办法，创制土设备来实现的。影片介绍的天津装卸机械化、上海包装机械化等都是工人们从废料堆里，收集来材料，自己设计，自己创造实现的。全国红旗单位河南开封机械厂，为了今年生产八百台联合收割机，没有钢材，他们就自己动手装制压钢机；没有大的电动机，他们就以多代大，巧妙地用八台小电动机带动一台大发电机等。
    在技术革命运动当中，人们的精神面貌起了极为深刻的变化。广大群众在党的领导下，在毛主席不断革命论和革命发展阶段论的思想指导下，进一步提高了认识，破除迷信，解放了思想，以冲天的干劲和革命的毅力来大闹技术革新和技术革命，风格也更高。像影片里介绍的开封机械厂，在党委的号召之后，仅仅一个昼夜，就革新技术一百多项，使许多落后工序走上了机械化和自动化。冲床工人王本祯由于创造了万能冲床，现在，他已经在作1972年的工作了。哈尔滨猪鬃厂，原来有人说：猪鬃生产是一万年的手工业，别人可以大跃进，我们只能小提高。在党的领导下，经过这次大闹技术革新，彻底解放了思想，用一百零八天的时间，实现了机械化、自动化连续生产，结束了这个厂猪鬃生产一百零八年手工操作的历史。老工人李少有从一把雨伞的开关上得到启发，创造了“整把”的自动卡子和梳绒机。工人刘政，在党的支持和同志们的协助下，试验虽然失败了一千多次，但最后终于创造成功了猪鬃分尺机。从这里也可以看出技术革命运动大大促进了工人群众的知识化。
    “革新花开遍地红”是一部由五个短片组成的特辑，但，它们在艺术表现上却有一个共同的特点，这就是大都采用了鲜明的对比手法，清楚地说明了革新的必要，生动地表现了革新的效果，虽然反映的是技术问题，却使人一看就懂。同时在表现革新过程的时候，又赋予了影片某些交流经验的科教性质，使它具有较强的启发性。由于这部影片比较全面地概括了当前正在轰轰烈烈展开的技术革新和技术革命运动，表现了广大劳动人民立大志、树雄心的新的风貌，并且具体地介绍了许多革新、创造，而这一切又体现在一种容易被群众所接受的艺术形式里，因此，这部影片的上映，将进一步鼓舞群众的首创精神，促进技术革新和技术革命运动。
