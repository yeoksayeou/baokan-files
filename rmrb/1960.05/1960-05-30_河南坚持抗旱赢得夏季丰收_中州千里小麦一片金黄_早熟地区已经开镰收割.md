Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, May 29th: Henan Province has victoriously unveiled the prelude to the summer harvest. Since May 20th, the vast masses of the province have been welcoming the harvest with joyous hearts. Xinyang Prefecture, located in the Huai River basin with an earlier season, began harvesting in mid-May. The prefecture's 2.9 million-strong army of wheat harvesters, wielding a variety of new-style wheat harvesting tools in a coordinated fashion, has launched a mighty harvest battle. As of the 26th, over 210,000 mu of wheat have been harvested throughout the prefecture. In the Dabie Mountain areas of Huainan, such as Xin County, Huangchuan, and Gushi, over 80% of the barley has been harvested, and over 30,000 mu of wheat have also been harvested. In various counties of Xuchang Prefecture and the suburbs of Zhengzhou City, early-maturing wheat has also begun to be harvested.

The summer crops of Henan Province, from the beginning of sowing last year to the time of harvest, have been carried out under severe drought conditions. Thanks to the firm establishment of the idea that "man can conquer nature" by the broad masses and their persistent long-term drought resistance, a bumper harvest has finally been achieved. Now, throughout the province, whether in the mountains or plains, the land is covered in gold, and wheat waves surge into the sky. Reports of bumper harvests are constantly pouring in from various places. Xin County, located in the Dabie Mountains, has thin soil and rocky land, and its yield has been very low in previous years. This year, the local people launched a vigorous movement to transform mountainous areas into plains. The 1,000 mu of wheat that have already been harvested and threshed have all increased production by more than 20% compared to last year. Changshan Brigade of Qiaogou Commune in Huaibin County is a historically well-known depression area that is "flooded nine years out of ten." Last year, relying on the superiority of the commune, they adopted a method of large-scale cooperation and reclaimed 1,441 mu of new wasteland to plant barley. The 155 mu that have already been harvested and threshed have been verified to have a per-mu yield that is more than 10% higher than the best wheat fields in this brigade before communization.

Before the wheat harvest, all localities made early preparations for labor, tools, and livestock. As soon as the wheat ripened, a tense battle began. During the harvest, all localities harvested and threshed carefully, ensuring that every grain was brought home. In Xinzheng County, two teams were organized for the wheat harvest: the front team was the harvesting army, and the rear team was the gleaning squad, ensuring that harvesting and gleaning were done as the wheat ripened, leaving no grain behind. On the first day of wheat harvesting in Zhaozhai Brigade of Libukou Commune in Shangshui County, members of the gleaning team recited a quick beat while picking up wheat ears: The wheat stalks are deep, the wheat ears are big, the wheat grains are like soybeans. Smell it and laugh, look at it and feel happy. Everyone says last year's harvest was good, but this year's is even more amazing.

Mechanized, semi-mechanized, and complete sets of tools have shown great power in the wheat harvest. According to incomplete statistics, the province has created, modified, and imitated more than 445,000 pieces of semi-mechanized and improved agricultural tools, including more than 3,000 "Taigu" harvesters, nearly 6,000 wheat threshers, and more than 14 million small summer harvesting tools. This year, Guangshan County in Xinyang Prefecture has newly manufactured and modified various advanced harvesting tools that can handle 90% of the county's wheat harvesting area, basically realizing semi-mechanization of harvesting; the wheat harvesting task will be completed three days earlier than in previous years. On the first day of wheat harvesting in Fanghu Commune in Huaibin County, Jiang Shuzhi, the Party Branch Secretary of the commune's machinery factory, and technician Xu Guangdao operated a harvester that harvested 35 mu in one day. It was not only fast but also left shallow stubble, without dropping ears or threshing grains.

Due to the large task and tight schedule of this year's wheat harvest, the scale of support for the wheat harvest in various localities is larger than in any previous year. Large numbers of cadres from various regions, teachers and students from schools, workers from factories, and officers and soldiers from the army have actively organized shock brigades and transportation teams to support rural wheat harvesting. Xinyang Prefecture has a support army of 860,000 people, organized into more than 18,000 shock brigades, led by responsible cadres, to divide up areas and provide support to areas with large wheat harvesting tasks and a shortage of labor. Commercial and industrial departments have also formulated plans to support the wheat harvest. Xinyang Prefecture has more than 90,000 workers, forming more than 9,900 mobile repair teams, going deep into the fields to help repair wheat harvesting tools. Commercial personnel deliver goods to the fields and establish field service stations and sales sheds in the fields to fully supply the daily necessities of the wheat harvesting army. The 232 standard sets of tractors and 120 combine harvesters dispatched by fraternal provinces have also rushed to support the areas.

    河南坚持抗旱赢得夏季丰收
    中州千里小麦一片金黄　早熟地区已经开镰收割
    新华社郑州29日电　河南省已胜利的揭开了夏收序幕。从5月20日以来，全省广大群众以喜悦的心情迎接丰收。位于淮河流域季节较早的信阳专区，5月中旬就已开镰收割。全区二百九十万麦收大军，驾驶着一条龙各色新式麦收工具，浩浩荡荡地展开了麦收战斗。截至26日止，全区已收割小麦二十一万多亩。淮南大别山区的新县、潢川、固始等县，大麦已收割80％以上，小麦也收割了三万多亩。许昌专区各县和郑州市郊区，早熟的小麦也已开镰收割。
    河南省夏收作物，从去年开始播种到收割时为止，都是在严重的干旱情况下进行的。由于广大群众坚定不移地树立了“人定胜天”的思想，坚持长期抗旱，终于赢得丰收。现在，全省不论山区、平原，大地铺金，麦浪掀天。各地丰收喜报不断传来。位于大别山的新县，耕地石厚土薄，历年产量很低，今年当地人民展开轰轰烈烈的山区赶平原运动，已收打的一千亩小麦，都比去年增产二成以上。淮滨县桥沟公社场山大队是历史上有名的“十年九淹”洼地。去年，依靠公社优越性，采取大协作的办法，开垦新荒一千四百四十一亩种上大麦。现在已收、打的一百五十五亩经过脱粒核实，每亩产量比公社化以前这个大队最好的麦地还增产一成以上。
    各地在麦收以前，都及早做好了劳力、工具、畜力等准备。麦子一成熟就开始了紧张的战斗。收割中，各地细收细打，颗粒还家。新郑县在麦收中组织两套人马，前面是收割大军，后面是拾麦小队，作到随熟随收，随收随拾，全县已收的一千六百三十一亩麦子，基本上达到了“收尽、拾尽，一颗不留，一穗不掉”。商水县李埠口公社赵寨大队收割小麦的第一天，拾麦专业队的人们一边拣麦穗，一边说快板：麦棵深，麦穗大，麦粒豆籽没二样。闻一闻，笑哈哈，看一看，心开花，都说去年收成好，今年更是叫呱呱。
    机械化、半机械化和配套成龙的工具，在麦收中大显威风。据不完全统计，全省已创制、改制和仿制的半机械化和改良农具有四十四万五千多件，其中“太谷号”收割机三千多部，小麦脱粒机近六千部，各种小件的夏收工具一千四百多万件。信阳专区光山县今年新制、改制的各式先进收割工具，可担负全县90％的麦收面积，全县基本上实现了收割半机械化；比往年要提前三天完成麦收任务。淮滨县防湖公社麦收第一天，社机械厂党支部书记江树芝和技工徐广道操纵的一部收割机，一天就割收三十五亩，不仅收得快，而且留茬浅，不掉穗，不脱粒。
    由于今年麦收任务大，时间紧的特点，各地支援麦收的规模都比以往任何一年都大。各个地区大批机关干部、学校师生、工厂职工、部队官兵都积极组织突击队、运输队支援农村麦收。信阳专区有八十六万人的支援大军，组织了一万八千多个突击队，由负责干部带领，分片包干，到麦收任务大、劳力缺乏的地区去支援。商业部门和工业部门也订出了支援麦收的计划，信阳专区有九万多名工人，组成九千九百多个流动修配组，深入田间，帮助修配麦收工具。商业人员送货到田，在田间建立田头服务站、售货棚，充分供应麦收大军的生活日用品。兄弟省分派来支援的二百三十二个标准台拖拉机和一百二十台康拜因收割机，也都赶到支援地区。
