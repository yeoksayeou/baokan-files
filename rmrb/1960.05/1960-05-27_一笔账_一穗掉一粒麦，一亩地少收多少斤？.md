    An Accounting
    One ear of wheat lost, one grain dropped. How many pounds less per mu?
    When Li Liu Production Team of Li Ji People's Commune, Xinzhou County, Hubei Province, was rushing to harvest wheat, the cadres and members calculated an accounting regarding careful harvesting and threshing:
    The team has 1,445 mu of wheat. Calculating 400,000 ears of wheat per mu, if one grain is dropped per ear, one mu will lose 400,000 grains. Based on 15,000 grains per pound, each mu will yield twenty-six more pounds less, and the whole team will yield more than 37,500 pounds less.
    This calculation greatly educated the cadres and members. The team further mobilized the masses to discuss and formulate measures for rushing to harvest and thresh: 1. The production team established a meticulous harvesting and threshing acceptance team, composed of eleven people, including the Party branch secretary, production team leader, storekeeper, and member representatives, to go deep into the wheat fields for inspection and acceptance. If the harvesting does not meet the requirements, they will promptly supervise rework. 2. In order to harvest and thresh quickly, two threshers, three field threshing grounds, and three warehouses have been prepared. 3. Organized fifteen wheat-picking teams with 310 children participating in wheat-picking, guaranteeing that all wheat ears in the wheat fields and roadsides are picked up.

    一笔账
    一穗掉一粒麦，一亩地少收多少斤？
    湖北新洲县李集人民公社李刘生产队在抢收小麦时，干部和社员就细收细打问题算了一笔账：
    全队一千四百四十五亩小麦，每亩以四十万穗小麦计算，一穗掉一粒，一亩就要损耗四十万粒。按一万五千粒一斤重量计算，每亩就要少收二十六斤多，全队共少收三万七千五百多斤。
    这样一算，干部和社员都受到了很大的教育。全队又进一步发动群众讨论和制订了抢收抢打的措施：一、生产队成立细收细打验收小组，由党支部书记、生产队长、保管员和社员代表共十一人组成，深入到麦地检查验收，收割时不合要求的，及时督促返工。二、为了快割快打，现已准备好脱粒机二部、田间稻场三个、仓库三个。三、以小队为单位，组织十五个捡麦小组，共三百一十个儿童参加捡麦，保证把麦地、路边的麦穗全部捡回。
