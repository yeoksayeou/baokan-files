　　        Korean "Rodong Sinmun" says
    The provocative activities of US imperialism destroyed the summit conference

    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 18th - "Rodong Sinmun" published an editorial today condemning US imperialism for undermining the Four Power Summit and supporting Khrushchev's statement at the preparatory meeting of the summit. The editorial said: "The US imperialists' rabid and robber-like aggressive actions and provocative war conspiracies against the Soviet Union and the socialist camp countries have frustrated the convening of the summit conference, which the people of the world are watching."

    The editorial said that Khrushchev's statement expressed the Soviet Union's consistent and resolute stance of preventing aggression and achieving genuine peace, and it is also an extremely natural and just claim. The Korean people fully support this statement. It is in line with the indignation of all peace-loving people around the world towards the unreasonable and robber-like provocative actions of the US imperialist aggressors.

    The editorial said: "It can be clearly seen from all actions that although Eisenhower said he came to Paris to participate in the summit conference, the US imperialists did not make any preparations to ease international tensions and improve relations between Eastern and Western countries." What else can be discussed with US imperialism to this extent? If Eisenhower and Herter shamelessly consider military reconnaissance and violation of other countries' airspace as "legitimate," what is the need for international law? What value is there in repeatedly saying that they respect the UN Charter?

    The editorial pointed out that the US imperialists' robber-like invasion of Soviet airspace is not only an act of aggression against the Soviet Union, but also against the entire socialist camp, and also an open provocation against all peace-loving people in the world.

    The editorial said: "Obviously, discussing the issue of maintaining security and order with the robber chief who openly clamors to continue robber behavior will not lead to any results. Doing so will not only waste time, but also create some harmful illusions among good people."

    The editorial continued, "In terms of the balance of international forces, after the socialist (forces) decisively overwhelm and surpass the imperialist war forces, Eisenhower and Herter's clique have to clamor for 'peace' and 'talks,' which is only a smokescreen for them to buy time to salvage their bankrupt military advantage and to cover up preparations for a new war."

    The editorial said: "Just as a wolf cannot become a sheep, the nature of imperialism will not change. Obviously, they will not voluntarily abandon aggression and war."

    "Democratic Korea" also published a commentary today saying that the summit conference was frustrated before it was officially opened due to Eisenhower's robber-like destructive activities. The US imperialists' dispatch of military reconnaissance planes to invade Soviet airspace is a provocative action deliberately aimed at undermining the summit conference. The Korean people are greatly indignant at this and believe that this provocative behavior is not only an invasion of the Soviet Union, but also a challenge to the entire socialist camp and peace-loving people around the world.

　　        Vietnamese "People's Daily" says
  Holding the Four Power Conference at present will help the United States deceive the people of the world

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 18th - The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published an editorial today entitled "No Peaceful Negotiations Can Be Held with Elements Who Continue to Prepare for Aggressive War," supporting Khrushchev's statement at the preparatory meeting of the Four Power Summit. The editorial said that the conspiracies and actions of the US authorities have made it clearer to the people of the world that US imperialism is still pursuing a policy of arms race and preparing for aggressive war. "When the purpose of all US actions is to prepare for war, how can people believe that the United States wants peace? When the US 'national policy' is to conduct reconnaissance against the Soviet Union in order to formulate plans to attack the Soviet Union, how can people believe that the United States wants to coexist peacefully with the Soviet Union and conduct consultations with the Soviet Union? When US Secretary of State Herter says that the United States has no purpose in participating in the Four Power Summit and does not hope for the success of the meeting, how can people believe that the United States sincerely hopes for the summit to achieve results?" It pointed out that Khrushchev's statement was "quite understandable and necessary."

    The editorial pointed out, "The above situation confronts the people of the world with the fact that if the US government continues its conspiracies to create war and persists in its stubborn attitude, then the summit conference will not be able to achieve the results that people hope for, and holding a meeting under the current conditions will create conditions for the US government to create deceptive arguments and paralyze the vigilance of the people of the world, including the American people."

    The editorial concluded by pointing out that we love peace, but we cannot beg for peace, and we must wage a resolute struggle to defend peace.

　　          Japanese "Akahata" says
    We should not have any illusions about US imperialism

    Xinhua News Agency, 18th - Tokyo News: The Japanese Communist Party's organ, "Akahata," pointed out in today's editorial that US imperialism must be held responsible for undermining the Four Power Summit. It said that the actions of the US spy planes destroyed the bright prospects for the success of the Four Power Summit.

    The editorial pointed out that the widely watched US spy plane incident was not an accidental event. This incident only exposed the fact that the United States has been continuously undermining peace since the Camp David talks.

    "Akahata" said that the United States dared to say that conducting spy flights over other countries is US national policy. "When all this is revealed, who can deny Khrushchev's statement that it is meaningless to hold a summit under the threat of the United States."

    The editorial said: "The Japanese people who are fighting against the Japan-US military alliance must draw two lessons from the recent developments: First, it should be remembered that the US imperialists are the most brutal of all imperialists. Their nature has not changed. Therefore, we should not have any illusions about their bellicose nature. Second, the overly optimistic mood that the world is moving smoothly towards peace has clearly gone bankrupt. The facts show that peace cannot be achieved unless the people wage a merciless struggle against the US imperialists and their accomplices."

    The editorial emphasized that "the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet is the most faithful follower of the US imperialists and is determined to undermine world peace together with the United States."

    "Akahata" concluded by saying, "The Japanese people should demonstrate a firm determination to fight against the US imperialists in the current struggle against the (Security) Treaty. Cooperation with the people of all countries in the world, especially with the people of China and Korea, should be strengthened."

　　          British "Daily Worker" says
      The United States must be held responsible for the fate of the Four Power Summit

    Xinhua News Agency, London, 17th - The "Daily Worker" pointed out in today's editorial that the United States must be held responsible for the fate of the Four Power Summit.

    The newspaper said that US militarists brazenly violated the Soviet border. They added the U-2 plane incident to the work of the Four Power Summit and ordered a world-scale "military alert" a few hours before the opening of the Four Power Summit.

    The editorial pointed out that, however, Khrushchev "gave Eisenhower a chance to clear the way (in the Four Power Summit) for holding fruitful discussions, that is, to condemn the dispatch of the plane, make a clear guarantee that such things will not happen again, and punish those who should be held responsible for this."

    The editorial asked, "When there is no intention of apologizing for past crimes, how can vague guarantees for the future be believed?"

    The newspaper also condemned Macmillan's attitude towards the US spy plane's invasion of Soviet airspace. The editorial said that the British people want Macmillan to "stand up to the Americans, condemn this spy flight, and declare that British bases cannot be used for such activities under any circumstances."

    朝鲜等国舆论愤怒谴责美国破坏四国会议
    各国人民要对美帝国主义进行无情斗争
              朝鲜“劳动新闻”说
    美帝国主义的挑衅活动破坏了首脑会议
    新华社平壤18日电　“劳动新闻”今天发表社论谴责美帝国主义破坏四国首脑会议，并支持赫鲁晓夫在首脑会议预备会议上的声明。社论说：“美帝国主义者为反对苏联和社会主义阵营国家疯狂进行的强盗般的侵略行动和挑衅战争的阴谋活动，挫折了全世界人民注视着的首脑会议的召开。”
    社论说：赫鲁晓夫的声明苏联一贯为制止侵略行动、实现真正的和平的坚决立场的表示，也是极其当然而正当的主张。朝鲜人民完全支持这一声明。它是符合全世界一切爱好和平人民对美帝国主义侵略者的蛮不讲理的强盗般的挑衅行动的愤慨情绪的。
    社论说：“从一切行动可以清楚地看出，艾森豪威尔虽然说是为参加首脑会议来到巴黎，但是，美帝国主义者并没有为缓和国际紧张局势、为改善东西方国家间的关系做任何一点准备。”到这种地步还能同美帝国主义谈论什么呢？如果像艾森豪威尔和赫脱那样厚颜无耻地竟把进行军事侦察、侵犯他国领空也算是“正当的”，那么国际法还有什么必要呢？口口声声说尊重联合国宪章还有什么价值呢？
    社论指出，美帝国主义强盗般地对苏联领空的侵犯，不仅是对苏联，而且也是对整个社会主义阵营的侵略行动，也是公然对全世界一切爱好和平人民的挑衅行为。
    社论说：“很显然，同公开叫嚣要继续强盗行为的强盗头目谈论维持安全秩序问题，是不会得出什么结果的。那样做，不仅浪费时间，还将使善良的人民产生某种有害的幻想。”
    社论继续说，“在国际力量对比上，在社会主义（力量）决定性地压倒和超过了帝国主义战争势力以后，艾森豪威尔和赫脱一派不得不叫嚷什么‘和平’和‘会谈’，这只不过是他们为了获得挽救破了产的军事优势的时间，为了掩盖准备新战争的烟幕。”
    社论说：“正如狼不能变成羊一样，帝国主义的本性是不会改变的，很明显，它们是不会主动地抛弃侵略和战争的。”
    “民主朝鲜报”今天也发表评论说，首脑会议由于艾森豪威尔的强盗般的破坏活动，在正式开会之前就被挫折了。美帝国主义者派遣军用侦察飞机侵入苏联领空，是有意破坏首脑会议的挑衅行动，朝鲜人民对此感到很大的愤慨，认为这种挑衅行为不仅是对苏联的侵犯，而且也是对整个社会主义阵营和全世界爱好和平人民的挑战。
              越南“人民报”说
  目前举行四国会议将有助美国欺骗世界人民
    新华社河内18日电　越南“人民报”今天发表题为“不能同继续准备侵略战争的分子进行和平协商”的社论，支持赫鲁晓夫在四国首脑会议预备会议上发表的声明。社论说，美国当局的阴谋和行动使全世界人民更清楚地看到，美帝国主义仍在执行军备竞赛、准备侵略战争的政策。“当美国的一切行动的目的都在于准备战争的时候，人们怎能相信美国希望和平？当美国的‘国策’是对苏联进行侦察以便订立进攻苏联的计划的时候，人们怎能相信美国希望同苏联和平共处，同苏联进行协商？当美国国务卿赫脱说，美国参加四国首脑会议没有目的，而且也不希望会议成功的时候，人们又怎能相信美国真心诚意地希望首脑会议取得结果呢？”它指出，赫鲁晓夫的声明是“十分可以理解和必要的”。
    社论指出，“上述情况使世界人民面对着这个事实：如果美国政府仍然继续它的制造战争的阴谋，坚持顽固的态度，那末首脑会议将不可能达到人们所希望那样的结果，并且在目前条件下举行会议，将为美国政府制造欺骗论调、麻痹包括美国人民在内的世界人民的警惕性制造条件”。
    社论最后指出，我们热爱和平，但是，不能乞求和平，并且要进行坚决的斗争来保卫和平。
                日本“赤旗报”说
    我们不应对美帝国主义抱有任何幻想
    新华社18日讯　东京消息：日本共产党机关报——“赤旗报”在今天的社论中指出，美帝国主义要对破坏四国首脑会议负责。它说，美国间谍飞机的行动破坏了四国首脑会议取得成功的光辉前景。
    社论指出，万人注目的美国间谍飞机事件不是偶然的事件，这次事件只是暴露了美国在戴维营会谈以后继续不断地一直在破坏和平。
    “赤旗报”说，美国竟敢说，到其他国家上空进行间谍飞行是美国的国策，“当这一切昭然若揭的时候，谁能否认赫鲁晓夫说的在美国的威胁之下，举行首脑会议是没有意义的话。”
    社论说：“进行反对日美军事同盟的斗争的日本人民必须从最近的发展中吸取两个教训：第一，应该记住，美帝国主义者是所有帝国主义者当中最残暴的。它们的本质并没有改变。因此，我们不应该对它的好战本质抱有任何幻想。第二，认为世界正在向着和平顺利迈进的过份的乐观情绪显然已经破产了。事实表明，如果人民不对美帝国主义者和他们的帮凶进行无情的斗争，和平就不能实现。”
    社论强调指出，“岸信介内阁是美帝国主义者最忠实的追随者，一心同美国一起破坏世界和平。”
    “赤旗报”最后说，“日本人民在目前反对（安全）条约的斗争中应当表现出对美帝国主义者进行斗争的坚定决心。应当加强同世界各国人民的合作，特别是同中国和朝鲜人民的合作。”
              英国“工人日报”说
      美国应对四国首脑会议的命运负责
    新华社伦敦17日电　“工人日报”在今天的社论中指出，美国应对四国首脑会议的命运负责。
    这家报纸说，美国军国主义分子悍然侵犯苏联边境。他们使四国首脑会议的工作中添了U—2机事件，并且在四国首脑会议开幕前的几小时下令实行一次世界规模的“军事警戒”。
    社论指出，但是，赫鲁晓夫“给予艾森豪威尔以机会来扫清（在四国首脑会议中）举行有成果的讨论的道路，那就是，谴责派遣飞机的事，明确保证不再发生这样的事和惩罚那些应对这件事负责的人”。
    社论问道，“在对过去的犯罪活动毫无道歉的意思的时候，怎么能够相信对于未来的含糊其词的保证呢？”
    这家报纸还谴责麦克米伦对美国间谍飞机侵犯苏联领空所采取的态度。社论说，英国人民要麦克米伦“对美国人挺起腰来，谴责这种间谍飞行，并且宣布英国基地在任何情况下都不能被利用来进行这种活动”。
