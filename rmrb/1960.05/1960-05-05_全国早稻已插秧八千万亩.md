    National early rice has been transplanted on eighty million mu
    Xinhua News Agency, 4th - According to statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture on May 4th, including the amount of transplanting previously completed in areas south of the Five Ridges, over eighty million mu of early rice has been transplanted nationwide.
    This year, in arranging early rice production, the southern provinces have all adhered to the policy of combining high yield with more production and planting more. They have adopted methods such as reclaiming wasteland, converting fields, and increasing the multiple cropping index in every possible way to expand the early rice planting area. Guangdong Province has expanded its early rice area by more than three million mu compared to last year, Guangxi has also expanded by more than one million mu, and the provinces in the Yangtze River basin have also seen significant expansion.
    The sowing and seedling cultivation of early rice in various regions this year has generally been much earlier than in previous years. However, since March, there has been more rainy and low-temperature weather in the Yangtze River basin, and seedling rot has occurred in some areas of Hunan, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Zhejiang and other provinces. The masses in various regions have fully developed the revolutionary spirit of fighting against nature, protecting seedlings and rushing to transplant. According to preliminary understanding, the quality of transplanted early rice is also higher than last year.
    At present, areas north of the Five Ridges and in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River are concentrating all their efforts on rushing to transplant early rice.

    全国早稻已插秧八千万亩
    据新华社4日讯　据农业部5月4日统计，连以前五岭以南各地已完成的插秧数，全国早稻已插秧八千多万亩。
    今年南方各省安排早稻生产时，都坚持执行了高产多收和多种多收相结合的方针。采用垦荒、改田、提高复种指数等办法千方百计地扩大早稻栽种面积。广东省早稻已比去年扩大三百多万亩，广西也扩大了一百多万亩，长江流域各省也有显著的扩大。
    今年各地早稻的播种育秧一般也比往年提早很多。但3月以来，长江流域阴雨低温天气较多，湖南、江西、四川、浙江等省部分地区发生烂秧现象。各地群众充分发扬了与大自然斗争的革命精神，护秧抢插。据初步了解，已插早稻的插秧质量比去年也有提高。
    目前，五岭以北，长江中下游地区，正集中一切力量抢插早稻。
