    Fifteen years ago, the struggle of the Czechoslovak people won its final victory. The people of Czechoslovakia had been fighting for national and state independence for a long time. May 9th is the fifteenth anniversary of the liberation of Czechoslovakia, and our motherland's liberation not only from foreign but also from domestic capitalist shackles is inseparable from this date.

    Our people's struggle for freedom was arduous, and the victory was thanks to the Soviet Union. Our people have long had feelings for the great Russian people. Old folk legends describe that our days will only be good when the Cossacks water their horses on the banks of the Vltava River. This legend was realized on May 9, 1945. On this day, the heroic Soviet army liberated Prague. The collapse of the fascist occupation meant that Czechs and Slovaks were rescued from the path of death prepared for them by the barbaric German Nazis. After undergoing this historical test, our people naturally formed a united national front led by the long-tested Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. In the past, our people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, fought against the occupiers. After liberation, they once again, under the leadership of the Party, embarked on the path of people's democracy leading to socialism. This was not a peaceful road without obstacles and difficulties. Reactionaries at home and abroad tried their best to hinder our progress. In February 1948, we resolutely crushed the conspiracy of the reactionaries to take the country back to capitalism. International reactionaries are still not reconciled to the defeat of February 1948. As a Czech proverb says: The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak. They are powerless, and their power is getting smaller and smaller, not only unable to influence the development of liberated countries, but also unable to influence the development of countries that are still struggling for freedom.

    In just fifteen years, free Czechoslovakia has made remarkable achievements. Our country has undergone profound social, class, and economic changes. As a result, the basic tasks of the transition from capitalism to socialism have been solved, and the socialist system has been established.

    Socialist relations of production have become widespread and consolidated in the national economy, and productive forces have been fully developed. Socialist relations of production also occupy a decisive advantage in agriculture. Approximately 85% of agricultural land is already controlled by socialist economic components. The successful completion and expected over-fulfillment of this year's production tasks will not only complete the Second Five-Year Plan but also the construction of the material production base of socialism.

    The development of the Czechoslovak national economy in the fifteen years since the establishment of the laboring people's regime stands in stark contrast to the era of the bourgeois republic. The pre-war capitalist system plunged the Czechoslovak people into deep crisis, poverty, and despair. In contrast, the socialist path has led to a strong economic and cultural upsurge. Today, Czechoslovak industrial production is almost three times higher than the highest level achieved under the capitalist system. We also focus on solving particularly urgent tasks: transforming agriculture into the latest mechanized large-scale production. Therefore, compared with 1930, the total output value of an average worker in our agriculture has increased by 139%. Czechoslovakia has entered the ranks of the world's most industrially developed countries. Our population only accounts for 0.5% of the world's total population, but we produce almost 2% of the world's industrial production.

    On the basis of production growth, the material and cultural level of the Czechoslovak people has greatly improved. The gradual decline in the prices of food and industrial products, the constant increase in wages, social security, the increasing expansion of pensions and medical services, the continuous improvement of education levels, and the widespread development of our people's culture have placed Czechoslovakia in the forefront of the world.

    Between 1948 and 1959, the laboring people obtained 534,977 houses. By 1970, the laboring people will have obtained a total of 1.2 million new houses. This year will basically complete the directive passed by the National Congress of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia in 1956 to increase the consumption of the national citizens by one-third by 1960. It is of great significance that children studying in primary schools, technical schools, and specialized schools will receive textbooks and learning materials free of charge from September 1, 1960. This measure, like the guarantee of treatment for children under the age of fourteen in terms of health care, is not restricted by the origin and occupation of the parents. This already has the seeds of distribution according to communist principles.

    With the widespread participation of the laboring people, our country has formulated the Third Five-Year Plan for 1961-1965. During this period, we want to increase industrial production by about 50% compared with 1960, agricultural production by 21%, and people's consumption by at least 30%. The working hours for those working in deep mines will be shortened to 40 hours per week, and the working hours for other sectors of the national economy will be shortened to 42 hours. The reason why we can propose such high goals is because the Czechoslovak economy is an integral part of the world socialist economic system. Not only that, we regard this as an internationalist obligation, that is, to promote the completion of the basic economic task of the socialist camp, which is to catch up with or surpass the most developed capitalist countries in terms of per capita production. Czechoslovakia has already surpassed many developed capitalist countries in the production of major products, including France; and is catching up with West Germany, Britain, and the United States.

    No social force can achieve such achievements and revolutionary changes in social life in such a short period of time as the working class under the leadership of the Communist Party.

    The stage of socialist development in our country has put the following tasks on the agenda: reorganizing administrative divisions while further developing socialist democracy. The development of the Czechoslovak national economy and the development of socialist democracy undoubtedly prove the superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system.

    At its April meeting, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia adopted a resolution on expanding the powers and responsibilities of the People's Committees and enhancing their role in economic and cultural construction. As local organs of state power and state administrative organs in the provinces, districts, and localities, the People's Committees directly fulfill the will of the people. It has the nature of a state organ and the nature of a broad social organization at the same time. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia also discussed the issue of the election campaign, which will end with the election of all representative organs on June 12, 1960. The preparation for the election is carried out under the banner of high enthusiasm of the laboring people. The movement involves discussing the issue of completing the tasks of the final year of the Five-Year Plan, carrying out socialist competition and a national movement to strive for a major transformation in agriculture, ensuring spring fieldwork, and competitions in improving urban and rural equipment.

    As Comrade Novotny, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and President of the Czechoslovak Republic, mentioned in his report, the preparation for the election campaign will also be combined with the discussion of the new draft socialist constitution. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia has always consulted with the Party and the masses of the laboring people, whether in the past or now. The final draft of the new constitution will be submitted to the National Congress of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia for discussion in early July this year.

    The new constitution embodies all the profound revolutionary changes that have taken place in Czechoslovakia in politics, economy, and society, and at the same time will open the way for the further development of society towards communism. In this constitution, it will be fully and clearly shown that the lofty ideals for which the working class and other laboring people in many countries are still fighting have already become a reality in our country. Socialism has triumphed in Czechoslovakia. Czechs and Slovaks have become socialist people. They are equally united with other ethnic groups in a consolidated moral and political unity. The laboring people have freed themselves from exploitation, poverty, and unemployment, as well as social and political oppression, and have become conscious creators of their own lives. The power and decisive say in our country truly and only belong to the working class and all the laboring people. Czechoslovakia is a country of the dictatorship of the working class, and the working class is the leading force in the consolidated alliance of workers, peasants, and laboring intellectuals.

    A particularly prominent feature of the new socialist Czechoslovak constitution is the confirmation of the leading role of the Communist Party in social life. The new Czechoslovak constitution very clearly and fully reflects the fact that all the achievements made by our people in socialist construction have been achieved under the leadership of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia.

    The new draft constitution is based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism and the fact that the Czechoslovak Republic belongs to the world socialist system.

    There is no more appropriate day than the fifteenth anniversary of the liberation of Czechoslovakia by the Soviet Army to remind people once again: if it were not for the Communist Party's loyalty to Marxism-Leninism, and if it were not for the strong unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, we would not have achieved these achievements.

    The Communist Party has creatively applied the principles of Marxism-Leninism on building socialism, which reflect objective laws, in the specific conditions of Czechoslovakia, both in the past and now. Marxism-Leninism is a living doctrine that is constantly developed and enriched by revolutionary practice. The common Marxist-Leninist worldview is the solid ideological foundation for the unbreakable unity of the socialist camp. The laboring people in our country study the experiences of fraternal parties with great interest. The experiences of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union are of infinite help to us. Our people love the Communist Party of China and its Chairman Comrade Mao Zedong.

    We thoroughly follow the principles of proletarian internationalism in our efforts to establish friendly relations with the people of all countries. The eternal Czechoslovak-Soviet friendship is rooted in the hearts of the Czechoslovak people. This is not only because our country was liberated by the Soviet Army, but also because we have only achieved great achievements in socialist construction thanks to the fraternal assistance and cooperation of the Soviet Union. We have the same friendly and fraternal feelings for the great Chinese people and the people of other socialist countries.

    The interconnections between socialist countries are developing in all fields. This connection is based on new principles that did not exist under the capitalist system. Let us take trade relations as an example. Socialist countries, first of all the Soviet Union, and also our country, mainly export to China what is necessary for the development of the Chinese economy, namely machines and basic equipment. In the trade between Czechoslovakia and China, the export of machinery and equipment is close to 93%. This is good for both China and Czechoslovakia. The scientific and technological cooperation between Czechoslovakia and China has been developing smoothly since 1953. If Czechoslovakia provided more knowledge at the beginning, the situation has now changed. Now, the Chinese people are marching forward with their heads held high. The Chinese people have provided us with a lot of knowledge, and it can be said that they have provided us with more knowledge, even in departments such as the metallurgical and chemical industries, Chinese experts are successfully solving the most complex problems, often problems that developed capitalist countries cannot solve.

    The cultural connections between Czechoslovakia and China are also developing. Although we are thousands of miles away from each other, we are close to each other. Socialist countries form a friendly family and are getting closer and closer.

    An old Czech proverb says: "Surround yourself with friends instead of fences." Today, the guarantee of freedom for our socialist motherland is that we belong to the socialist camp, which is strong in politics, economy, and military affairs. If it were not so, then the situation in Czechoslovakia, which directly borders West Germany, a country of revanchism and militarism, would be dangerous. But fortunately, this is not the case.

    Recently, the international situation has eased to a certain extent. This is an undeniable victory for Lenin's policy of peace. Today, the majority of mankind recognizes and supports the idea of peaceful coexistence, and demands that international disputes be resolved through negotiations. The summit meeting will be convened soon. Comrade Khrushchev, who tirelessly fights for world peace, will receive the full support of all socialist countries and many other countries at this meeting.

    The day is not far off when the People's Republic of China will also enjoy all legitimate rights on the international stage. More and more nations are standing up like giants and have been liberated. We fully sympathize with and support them.

    Today, as the Czechoslovak people celebrate the fifteenth anniversary of the liberation of their motherland, they stand firmly in the ranks of the people of all countries fighting for peace. We are convinced that strength, firmness, and unity will work on the imperialists. Therefore, we strengthen the political and moral unity of the Czechoslovak people on the principles of socialist patriotism and proletarian internationalism. Therefore, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia calls on the laboring people to play a greater role in mobilizing their initiative. Therefore, the Czechoslovak people will always promote the unity of socialist countries and implement the line of international unity and friendship among the people of all countries in the struggle for lasting peace.

    自由的捷克斯洛伐克十五年
    捷共中央政治局委员、捷克斯洛伐克共和国副总理
      兼内务部长  鲁道夫·巴拉克
    十五年前，捷克斯洛伐克人民的斗争赢得了最后的胜利。捷克斯洛伐克人民从很早以来，就为争取民族和国家的独立而进行斗争。5月9日是捷克斯洛伐克解放十五周年纪念日，我们的祖国不仅从外国的而且从国内的资本主义桎梏下获得解放，是同这个日子分不开的。
    我国人民争取自由的斗争是艰巨的，取得这一胜利要感谢苏联。我国人民很早以来就对伟大的俄罗斯人民有感情。旧的民间传说中，描述只有哥萨克饮马伏尔塔瓦河边时，我们的日子才能过得美好起来。这一传说在1945年5月9日实现了。这一天，英雄的苏联军队解放了布拉格。法西斯占领的垮台，意味着捷克人和斯洛伐克人从野蛮的德国纳粹给他们准备的死亡之路上得到了解救。我国人民在经受了这次历史考验之后，很自然地结成了由久经考验的捷克斯洛伐克共产党领导的统一民族阵线。过去在共产党领导下为反对占领者而斗争的我国人民，解放以后，又在党的领导下走上了通往社会主义的人民民主道路。这不是一条毫无阻碍、毫无困难的和平道路。国内外的反动派竭力阻挠我们前进。1948年2月我们坚决地粉碎了反动派要使国家倒退到资本主义去的阴谋。国际反动派直到现在还不甘心1948年2月的失败。它正像捷克谚语所说的：心有余而力不足。它们无能为力，它们的力量越来越小，不仅不能影响已解放国家的发展，而且也影响不了迄今仍为争取自由而斗争的国家的发展。
    在短短的十五年内，自由的捷克斯洛伐克取得了显著的成就。我国经历了深刻的社会、阶级和经济的变革。结果解决了从资本主义向社会主义过渡的基本任务，并确立了社会主义制度。
    社会主义生产关系在国民经济中普及了，巩固了；生产力有了全面的发展。社会主义生产关系在农业中也占了决定的优势。大约农业用地的85％，已经由社会主义经济成分所掌握。今年生产任务的顺利完成和预计超额完成，将不仅是完成第二个五年计划，同时也是社会主义物质生产基础的建成。
    自从劳动人民政权建立十五年来，捷克斯洛伐克国民经济的发展，同资产阶级共和国时代恰成一鲜明的对比。战前的资本主义制度，使捷克斯洛伐克人民陷于深重的危机、贫困和绝望。与此相反，社会主义的道路却导致经济和文化的强大高涨。今天，捷克斯洛伐克工业生产几乎比资本主义制度下所达到的最高水平多三倍。我们还着重解决特别迫切的任务：使农业过渡为最新的机械化大生产。因此，同1930年相比，我国农业中平均一个工作人员的总产值增加139％。捷克斯洛伐克步入了世界上工业最发达的国家行列。我国人口总共只占整个地球人口的0.5％，但是我们生产的东西几乎占世界工业生产的2％。
    在生产增长的基础上，捷克斯洛伐克人民的物质和文化水平，大大地提高了。粮食和工业品价格的逐步下降、工资的经常提高、社会保障、养老抚恤和医疗服务的日益扩大，教育水平的不断提高以及我国人民文化的广泛发展，使捷克斯洛伐克处在世界上的先进行列。
    在1948—1959年间，劳动人民得到了五十三万四千九百七十七套房子，到1970年时，劳动人民总共将得到一百二十万套新住宅。今年将基本上完成1956年捷共全国代表会议通过的到1960年使全国公民的消费量提高三分之一的指令。从1960年9月1日起，凡是在小学、工艺学校和专科学校里学习的孩子们，将免费领到教科书和学习用具，这是具有重大意义的事。这一措施正如在卫生保健方面对十四岁以下儿童的保障待遇一样，不受家长的出身和职业的限制。这已具有了按共产主义原则进行分配的萌芽。
    在劳动人民的广泛参加下，我国制定了1961—1965年第三个五年计划。在这段时间里，我们要使工业生产比1960年大约增加50％，农业生产增加21％，人民消费起码增加30％。在深矿井下工作的工作时间将缩短为每周四十小时，国民经济其他部门将缩短为四十二小时。我们之所以能够提出这样高的目标，是因为捷克斯洛伐克经济是世界社会主义经济体系的组成部分。不仅如此，我们把这看作是国际主义的义务，即促进社会主义阵营基本经济任务的完成，这一基本任务是在按人口平均的生产方面赶上或超过工业最发达的资本主义国家。捷克斯洛伐克在主要产品的生产方面，已经赶过了好多发达的资本主义国家，其中有法国；正在赶上西德、英国和美国。
    任何社会力量都不能像共产党领导下的工人阶级这样在短暂的时间内，在社会生活中取得这样的成就和革命变革。
    我国社会主义发展的阶段，把下列任务提到日程上来了：改组行政区划，同时进一步发展社会主义民主。捷克斯洛伐克国民经济的发展和社会主义民主的发展，确凿无疑地证明了社会主义制度对资本主义制度的优越性。
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央，在四月会议上通过了关于扩大人民委员会的权力和责任以及提高它们在经济和文化建设中作用的决议。人民委员会作为国家政权的地方机关和国家在州、区和地方的管理机关，直接履行人民的意志，它既具有国家机关的性质，同时又具有广泛的社会组织的性质。捷共中央还讨论了选举运动的问题，这一运动将以1960年6月12日一切代表机关举行选举而结束。准备选举的运动是在劳动人民积极性高涨的标志下进行的。在这一运动中讨论完成五年计划最后一年任务的问题、开展社会主义竞赛和争取农业大转变的全民运动、确保春季田间工作、在改善城乡设备方面的竞赛等问题。
    正如捷共中央第一书记和捷克斯洛伐克共和国总统诺沃提尼同志在报告中所谈到的，准备选举的运动还将同讨论新的社会主义宪法草案结合起来。无论过去任何时候或现在，捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央都同党和劳动人民群众进行商量。新宪法的最后草案，将在今年7月初提交捷克斯洛伐克共产党全国代表会议进行讨论。
    新宪法体现了捷克斯洛伐克所发生的一切政治、经济和社会的深刻革命变革，同时将为社会进一步向共产主义发展开辟道路。在这部宪法中将完全鲜明地显示出，在许多国家里工人阶级和其他劳动人民至今仍在为之斗争的崇高理想，已经在我国成为现实。社会主义在捷克斯洛伐克胜利了。捷克人和斯洛伐克人成了社会主义的人民。他们同其他民族平等地结成了巩固的道义和政治上的团结。劳动人民摆脱了剥削、贫困和失业，以及社会和政治压迫，成了自己生活的自觉的创造者。我国的政权和决定性的发言权真正地只属于工人阶级和一切劳动人民。捷克斯洛伐克，这是工人阶级专政的国家，工人阶级是工人、农民和劳动知识分子的巩固联盟中的领导力量。
    新的社会主义捷克斯洛伐克宪法的特别显著的特征，是确认共产党在社会生活中的领导作用。新的捷克斯洛伐克宪法，十分鲜明而且充分体现出这样一个事实，即我国人民在社会主义建设中所取得的一切成就，都是在捷克斯洛伐克共产党领导下取得的。
    新的宪法草案，以马克思列宁主义原则和捷克斯洛伐克共和国属于全世界社会主义体系为基础。
    没有比苏军解放捷克斯洛伐克十五周年更合适的日子来再一次提醒人们：如果不是共产党忠于马克思列宁主义，如果没有以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的坚强团结，我们就不会取得这些成就。
    共产党无论过去和现在都在捷克斯洛伐克的具体条件下创造性地运用了反映客观规律的马克思列宁主义的建设社会主义的原则。马克思列宁主义是由革命实践不断发展和丰富的活的学说。共同的马克思列宁主义世界观，是社会主义阵营的牢不可破的团结的巩固的思想基础。我国劳动人民以巨大的兴趣研究兄弟党的经验。苏联共产党的经验对于我们有无限的帮助。我国人民热爱中国共产党及其主席毛泽东同志。
    我们在努力同各国人民建立友好关系时，彻底地遵循着无产阶级国际主义的原则。永恒的捷苏友谊，在捷克斯洛伐克人民的内心深处扎了根。这不仅因为我国是苏军解放的，而且因为我们只是由于苏联的兄弟援助和同苏联的合作，才在社会主义建设中取得伟大成就的。我们对伟大的中国人民以及社会主义阵营其他各国人民有着同样的友好的兄弟情谊。
    社会主义国家的相互联系，在一切领域内发展着。这种联系是以资本主义制度下所不曾有的新原则为基础的。让我们举贸易关系作为例子。社会主义国家，首先是苏联，还有我国，向中国出口的主要是为发展中国经济所必需的东西，即机器和基本设备。在捷克斯洛伐克和中国的贸易中，机器和设备的出口接近93％。这对中国和捷克斯洛伐克都有好处。捷克斯洛伐克和中国的科学技术合作，自从1953年以来就顺利地发展着。如果说开始的时候捷克斯洛伐克提供的知识多些，那么现在的情况已发生了变化。现在，中国人民正昂首阔步向前迈进。中国人民已经向我们提供了许多知识，也可以说更多的知识，甚至在冶金和化学工业这样的部门，中国专家也在成功地解决着最复杂的、往往是工业发达的资本主义国家所不能解决的问题。
    捷克斯洛伐克和中国在文化方面的联系也在发展。尽管我们两国之间千里迢迢，但是我们彼此是亲近的。社会主义国家组成一个友好大家庭，并且日益亲密。
    古老的捷克谚语说：“用朋友而不要用篱笆把自己围起来”。今天我们社会主义祖国自由的保障，就是我们属于在政治、经济和军事上都强大的社会主义阵营。如果不是这样，那么我们在同复仇主义和军国主义的西德直接接壤的捷克斯洛伐克，情况就会是危险的。但是，幸而情况不是如此。
    近来，国际形势已经有了一定程度的缓和。这是列宁的和平政策的不可争辩的胜利。今天，人类的大多数承认并拥护和平共处思想，要求用谈判的方式解决国际争端。最高级会议不久就要召开了。不倦地为争取世界和平而斗争的赫鲁晓夫同志，在这次会议上将得到一切社会主义国家和许多其它国家的充分支持。
    中华人民共和国在国际舞台上也能享有一切合法权利的时候，为期不远了。越来越多的民族，巨人般站起来了，解放了。我们完全同情和支持他们。
    捷克斯洛伐克人民在庆祝祖国解放十五周年的今天，坚定地站在为争取和平而斗争的各国人民的行列。我们确信，力量、坚定和团结会对帝国主义者发生作用。因此，我们在社会主义爱国主义和无产阶级国际主义原则上加强捷克斯洛伐克人民的政治和道义上的团结。因此，捷克斯洛伐克共产党号召劳动人民发挥更大的积极性。因此，捷克斯洛伐克人民将永远促进社会主义国家的团结，并且实行各国人民在争取持久和平斗争中国际团结和友谊的路线。
