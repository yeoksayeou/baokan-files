The Xiangtan Umbrella Factory in Hunan Province has recently used indigenous methods and materials to create 42 types of machines, totaling 62 units, to transform 14 umbrella-making processes, such as rib shaving, rib grooving, and eye piercing, from manual operation to mechanized and semi-mechanized production.

This factory is the largest umbrella factory in Hunan Province, with products selling well at home and abroad. In the past, rib-shaving workers had to use their fingers to press against the knife to shave the ribs bit by bit. If they were not careful, they would injure their fingers. Now, sections of *nanmu* bamboo are quickly shaved into long ribs and supporting ribs by a rib-shaving machine; after the long ribs are grooved on a rib-grooving machine, they are quickly made into umbrellas of various styles and colors through stringing, paper backing, and oiling, increasing work efficiency by one to six times.

    机器做伞效率高
    湖南湘潭市制伞厂最近用土办法、土器材创造了四十二种共六十二台机具，使制造雨伞的削骨、鏪骨、通眼等十四个工序从手工操作改为机械化和半机械化生产。
    这个厂是湖南省最大的一个制伞厂，产品畅销国内外。过去，削骨的工人要用手指顶着刀子一下一下削，稍不小心，就会鏪伤手指。现在，一节节的楠竹经过削骨机，很快就削成了长骨和撑骨；长骨在鏪骨机上鏪好了槽，然后经过串吊、褙纸上油，很快就成了各种式样和不同颜色的雨伞，工效提高一到六倍。
