Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 19th: Over 12,000 faculty, students, and staff of Xi'an Jiaotong University held a rally on the 18th to support the Japanese people's opposition to the US-Japan military alliance treaty. The participants angrily condemned the US-Japan reactionaries' plot for a new war and expressed their firm support for the Japanese people's just struggle against the US-Japan military alliance treaty until the Japanese people achieve final victory. Speakers at the rally angrily denounced the bloody crimes of Japanese militarism during the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan. Zhao Fuxin, chairman of the university's trade union and head of the Department of Mathematics and Mechanics, recounted in his speech the suffering of the people when Japanese fascists occupied Shanghai in 1937 and the tragic circumstances of forcing Jiaotong University to move into the concession. He angrily warned the US-Japan reactionaries: "Warmongers! Your death knell is already ringing. The people of the world will unite to form a powerful united front against imperialism and completely shatter your despicable plot for a new war!" Jia Meirong, a worker-peasant-soldier student from the Department of Mechanical Engineering whose grandfather and aunt were shot and killed by the Japanese invading army, angrily denounced the blood debts owed by Japanese imperialism. She said: "We have an irreconcilable blood feud with Japanese imperialism, and we will never allow US imperialism to revive Japanese militarism. We resolutely oppose the US-Japan reactionaries' plot for a new war!" Her speech was constantly interrupted by the crowd's impassioned slogans.

    The congress finally passed a telegram expressing that they, along with the people of the whole country, would resolutely support the patriotic and just struggle of the Japanese people until the Japanese people achieve final victory.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 19th: People from all walks of life in Harbin have been writing letters and articles to newspapers in recent days, expressing their firm support for the Japanese people's just struggle against the US-Japan military alliance treaty.

    Wei Shuqin, a national pacesetter in theoretical study for workers, peasants and youth, and five other employees of Harbin's Seventh Department Store, said in an article entitled "The life of imperialism will not be long," that "US imperialism is a jackal" precisely and incisively reveals its reactionary nature. It is fostering the revival of Japanese militarism in Asia, plotting a new war of aggression, and vainly attempting to realize its dream of dominating the world. However, the era of US imperialism wantonly dominating the people of the world has passed. In this era where the East wind prevails over the West wind, what lies before them is only the graves that have already been dug. The article said that we firmly believe that the struggle of the Japanese people will surely be victorious. We must further expose the reactionary nature of imperialism and resolutely support the heroic struggle of the Japanese people.

    Su Guangming, a national model worker and engineer at the Harbin Rolling Stock Plant, said in a letter to the newspaper that the vast number of employees at our Harbin Rolling Stock Plant, together with the 650 million Chinese people, firmly support the heroic struggle of the Japanese working class and the Japanese people against the US-Japan military alliance treaty. The people of Harbin have suffered under the cruel rule of Japanese imperialism for fourteen years. They committed all kinds of atrocities, including murder and arson. We have vivid memories of these heinous crimes. Now, the evil US imperialism is colluding with the Japanese reactionaries to conclude a military alliance treaty, trying to push the Japanese people, the Chinese people, and the Asian people back into the abyss. We resolutely do not agree.

    Jiang Shuzhen, a female employee of the Harbin Transportation Company, wrote a letter to the newspaper saying, "I am forty-seven years old, and I have personally suffered the hardships inflicted by Japanese imperialism, and I also sent my eldest son to the battlefield to defend the motherland. As a mother, I deeply sympathize with and resolutely support the just struggle of the Japanese people."

    据新华社西安19日电　西安交通大学的一万二千多名师生员工18日举行了支援日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约大会。参加大会的师生员工们愤怒谴责美日反动派策划新战争的阴谋，并且表示坚决支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的正义斗争，直到日本人民取得最后胜利。在会上讲话的师生员工代表，愤怒地控诉了日本军国主义在八年侵华战争中的血腥罪行。这个学校的工会主席、数理力学系系主任赵富鑫在讲话中沉痛地叙述了1937年日本法西斯侵占上海时人民的苦难生活和强迫交通大学迁入租界时的惨状。他愤怒地警告美日反动派说：“战争贩子们！你们的丧钟已经在响了。全世界人民将联合起来，结成反对帝国主义的强大的统一战线，彻底粉碎你们策划新战争的可耻阴谋！”被日本侵略军枪杀了祖父和婶婶的机械系工农班学生贾梅荣在会上愤怒地控诉了日本帝国主义欠下的血债。她说：“我们和日本帝国主义有着血海深仇，我们决不容许美帝国主义扶植日本军国主义复活，坚决反对日美反动派策划新战争的阴谋！”她的讲话不断被群众激昂的口号声所打断。

    全国工农青年学习理论的标兵、哈尔滨第七百货商店售货员魏淑琴和另外五位职工，在题为“帝国主义的寿命不会很长了”的文章中说，“美帝国主义是豺狼”这句话，正一针见血地道破了它的反动本质。它在亚洲扶植日本军国主义复活，阴谋制造新的侵略战争，妄想实现称霸全世界的梦想，但是，美帝国主义任意宰割世界人民的时代已经过去了，在这东风压倒西风的时代，摆在他们面前的只是已经掘好了的坟墓。文章说，我们坚信，日本人民的斗争一定会取得胜利。我们要进一步揭穿帝国主义的反动本质，坚决支援日本人民的英勇斗争。

  哈尔滨市运输公司女职工姜淑贞写信给报社说，我四十七岁了，我亲身受过日本帝国主义加给的苦难，也送过大儿子走上战场保卫祖国。作为一个母亲，我非常同情并坚决支持日本人民的正义斗争。
