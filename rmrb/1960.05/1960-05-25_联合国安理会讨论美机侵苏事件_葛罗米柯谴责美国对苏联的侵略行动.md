Xinhua News Agency, New York, 24th. According to TASS, at the request of the Soviet government, the United Nations Security Council held a special meeting in New York on the 23rd to discuss "the aggressive actions of U.S. military aircraft against the Soviet Union, which pose a threat to universal peace."

Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko made a lengthy speech at the meeting.

Entrusted by the Soviet government, Gromyko presented the following draft resolution to the Security Council for discussion at the end of his speech:

"The Security Council, having discussed the question of the aggressive actions of U.S. military aircraft against the Soviet Union, which pose a threat to universal peace,

Points out that the violation of the sovereignty of other countries is incompatible with the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations,

Considers that such actions pose a threat to universal peace,

Condemns the intrusion of U.S. aircraft into the borders of other countries, and considers this an act of aggression,

Recommends that the U.S. government take immediate measures to stop such actions and prevent them from recurring in the future."

In his speech, Gromyko pointed out that the aggressive actions of U.S. military aircraft against the Soviet Union are a threat to peace, and if appropriate measures are not taken now to stop such actions, they will cause serious consequences.

Gromyko said that we are not facing the question of an accidental border incident, but an act of aggression unheard of in peacetime, prepared in advance, with the consent of the U.S. government, and implemented under its instructions. Such an action could only be imagined if one country were at war with another.

Gromyko pointed out that this is far from the first and only incident of the United States sending its military aircraft across the Soviet border. In recent years, U.S. military aircraft have used U.S. military bases established along the borders of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries to try every means to penetrate the Soviet interior. As a result, a series of U.S. military aircraft have violated the Soviet border.

He said that the Soviet government has protested more than once against the deliberate violation of the Soviet border by U.S. aircraft, and has urged the Security Council to pay attention to these aggressive actions by U.S. military aircraft.

Gromyko said that it can be seen from the statement issued by the U.S. Secretary of State that President Eisenhower's government has been pursuing this policy since it came to power.

Gromyko emphasized that the U.S. aircraft's spy flight into the Soviet Union on May 1 took place only a few days before the Four Power Summit was to open in Paris. Under such circumstances, the Soviet government had ample reason not to participate in the meeting. However, the Soviet government still decided to participate in the meeting, so Soviet government leader Khrushchev went to Paris. At that time, the Soviet government hoped that the U.S. government would have the courage to publicly condemn the aggressive actions of its aircraft during the personal meeting of the heads of state.

However, at the preparatory meeting with other heads of state, the U.S. President, in addition to re-promoting espionage and sabotage activities, insisted that such activities were necessary for U.S. national security. Eisenhower even believed that the United Nations could be used as a threat to cover up the U.S.'s aggressive policy. This was clearly hoping to transform the "doctrine" of seriously undermining the sovereignty of other countries, which was recently announced, into some kind of norm of international law, or more precisely, into a norm of international illegality. The U.S. government not only did not condemn and stop provocative actions, but actually advocated continuing such provocations on a broader basis, and wanted the United Nations to undertake the disreputable role of collecting espionage information for the Pentagon. The essence of the so-called "open skies" plan, which has been embellished, lies here.

The Soviet Foreign Minister then talked about the U.S.'s perfidious behavior towards the Soviet Union. He said that the U.S. President had just received the head of the Soviet government in Washington and Camp David, warmly entertained him, and said that mutual trust must be strengthened. However, at this time, the U.S. Air Force was carrying out a plan of aggression against the Soviet Union approved by Eisenhower himself. Isn't this an example of perfidious behavior?

Secondly, when countries were making preparations for the summit meeting, U.S. aircraft, according to a plan agreed to by the U.S. government, intruded into the Soviet border and conducted military reconnaissance at an altitude of tens of kilometers above the ground. Isn't this also an example of perfidious behavior?

Gromyko asked, after all this has happened, how can we trust the U.S.'s foreign policy?

Gromyko then pointed out that it is unfounded to minimize the significance of the U.S. aircraft's violation of Soviet airspace. He said that those who try to minimize the significance of the provocative actions of the U.S. imperialist group are intentionally or unintentionally helping a propaganda that is now facing a difficult task - trying to pull the U.S. government out of the quagmire it has fallen into due to the failure of its policy of espionage and sabotage against the Soviet Union.

Gromyko said that the Soviet government has submitted the issue of the aggressive actions of U.S. military aircraft to the Security Council for discussion because the violation of national sovereignty is the most dangerous aspect of this policy. The inviolability of the territory of various countries was and still is one of the most important and universally recognized principles of international law. Recognizing and abiding by this principle is the foundation of maintaining relations between countries. As history has proven, the violation of this principle usually leads to war, if the country that is the object of aggression does not intend to surrender, but is full of determination to fight back against the aggressor.

Gromyko pointed out that the Soviet government has stated more than once that the full power of the Soviet state and its armed forces, if necessary, will be used to defend the Soviet border and the inviolability of our sovereignty. It should also be assumed that no one will doubt that the Soviet Union has sufficient capabilities to force anyone to respect its rights.

The Soviet Foreign Minister pointed out that the issue of condemning the U.S.'s declared policy of violating the sovereignty of other countries is not only related to the Soviet Union. This issue has broad international significance and is most directly related to the fate of world peace. If this policy is encouraged, condoned, or even passively treated, it will mean that the danger of a new war will increase a hundredfold.

In his speech, Gromyko condemned those countries that provide their territory for U.S. aircraft to take off and carry out criminal activities against the Soviet Union.

Finally, Gromyko presented the Soviet draft resolution to the meeting for discussion.

Then, U.S. representative Lodge spoke, insisting that the U.S. "did not commit any act of aggression against the Soviet Union," and attempted to prove his point.

However, all of these attempts by the U.S. representative are completely untenable. Lodge insisted that the spy flights of U.S. aircraft in Soviet airspace were not U.S. national policy, but the U.S. Secretary of State and the U.S. President had already admitted in their statements on May 9 and 11 that these flights were part of a special plan implemented under the instructions of the U.S. President.

Lodge attempted to convince the Security Council members that these flights by U.S. aircraft were normal behavior in the interests of "U.S. security."

Lodge not only did not give the Security Council a clear and affirmative answer and guarantee that such flights would be stopped and not carried out again, but insisted that the U.S. "is willing" to negotiate with the Soviet Union on the conclusion of a treaty related to the "open skies" spy plan.

The Security Council will hold a second meeting on the 24th.

    联合国安理会讨论美机侵苏事件
    葛罗米柯谴责美国对苏联的侵略行动
    新华社24日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：应苏联政府的要求，联合国安全理事会23日在纽约举行了特别会议，讨论“关于美国军用飞机对苏联进行了对普遍和平造成威胁的侵略行动”的问题。
    苏联外交部长葛罗米柯在会上作了长篇发言。
    葛罗米柯受苏联政府委托，在结束发言时提出下列决议草案交安全理事会讨论：
    “安全理事会讨论了关于美国军用飞机对苏联进行了对普遍和平造成威胁的侵略行动的问题。
    指出破坏别国主权是同联合国宪章的原则和宗旨不相符合的，
    认为这种行动对普遍和平造成了威胁，
    谴责美国飞机侵犯别国国境，并认为这是侵略行为，
    建议美国政府立即采取措施，停止这种行动，今后不再重犯。”
    葛罗米柯在发言中指出，美国军用飞机对苏联的侵略行动是对和平的威胁，如果现在不采取适当措施来制止这种行动，那么这种行动会引起严重的后果。
  葛罗米柯说，摆在我们面前的不是偶然的边境事件的问题，而是在和平时期间所未闻的、事先准备好的、在美国政府的同意和在它指示下实现的侵略行动，这种行动，只有在一国处在同另一国交战的状态时，才能设想。
    葛罗米柯指出，这远不是美国派遣自己的军用飞机越过苏联国境的初次和唯一的事件。近几年来，美国军用飞机利用沿着苏联和其他社会主义国家边境设立的美国军事基地，用各种办法竭力渗入苏联内地。因此发生了一系列美国军用飞机对苏联国境的侵犯。
    他说，苏联政府不只一次地抗议过美国飞机对苏联国境的蓄意侵犯，并且曾经促请安全理事会注意美国军用飞机的这些侵略行动。
  葛罗米柯说，从美国国务卿发表的说明中可以看出，艾森豪威尔总统的政府自从开始执政以来就奉行着这个政策。
    葛罗米柯强调说，美国飞机5月1日入侵苏联的间谍飞行，只是在四国政府首脑会议要在巴黎开幕之前几天发生的。在这样的情况下，苏联政府有十分充足的理由不参加这个会议。然而，苏联政府仍然决定参加会议，因此苏联政府首脑赫鲁晓夫到了巴黎。当时，苏联政府希望美国政府在各国政府首脑举行个人会晤时，会拿出勇气来，公开指责自己飞机的侵略行动。
    然而，美国总统在同其他国家首脑举行的预备会议上，除了重新鼓吹间谍活动和破坏活动，硬说这种活动对美国的国家安全是必要的。艾森豪威尔甚至认为可以用威胁手段利用联合国来掩盖美国这个侵略政策，这显然是指望把不久前宣布的严重破坏其他国家主权的“主义”变成为国际法的某种的准则，更确切地说，就是变成国际不法行为的准则。美国政府不但不谴责和停止挑衅行动，而且实际上可以说是主张在更广泛的基础上继续这种挑衅，并要联合国担负为五角大楼搜集间谍情报的不体面的角色。经过修饰的所谓“开放天空”的计划的主旨就在这里。
    苏联外长然后谈到了美国对苏联的背信弃义行为。他说，美国总统刚刚在华盛顿、戴维营接待了苏联政府首脑，殷切地款待他，并且说必须加强相互之间的信任，但是，就在这个时候，美国空军正在执行由艾森豪威尔本人批准的对苏联的侵略行动的计划。难道这不是背信弃义行为的例子吗？
    其次，在各国都为最高级会议进行准备工作的时候，美国飞机根据美国政府同意的计划侵入苏联国境，在离地面几十公里的高空进行军事侦察。难道这不也是背信弃义行为的例子吗？
    葛罗米柯问道，在发生这一切事情之后，怎么能信任美国的外交政策呢？
    葛罗米柯接着指出，缩小美国飞机侵犯苏联领空事件的意义是毫无根据的。他说，那些企图缩小美国帝国主义集团挑衅性行动的意义的人，有意或无意地成了这样一种宣传的帮手，这种宣传现在面临着一个艰难的任务——企图把美国政府从由于它的对苏联进行间谍活动和破坏的政策失败而陷入的泥潭里拉出来。
    葛罗米柯说，苏联政府所以把关于美国军用飞机的侵略行动的问题提交安全理事会讨论，是因为，侵犯国家的主权是这一政策的一个最危险的方面。各国领土的不可侵犯过去是，现在仍然是国际法中最重要和公认的原则之一。承认和遵守这个原则，是保持国家之间关系的基础的基础。对这一原则的破坏，像历史所证明的那样，通常是导致战争的，如果成为侵略对象的国家不打算投降，而充满决心反击侵略者的话。
    葛罗米柯指出，苏联政府不止一次地声明，苏维埃国家和它的武装部队的全部威力，如果需要的话，将用来保卫苏联国境和我国主权的不可侵犯性。也应当认为，没有人会怀疑苏联拥有足够的可能性能迫使任何人尊重它的权利。
    苏联外交部长指出，关于谴责美国所宣布的侵犯他国主权的政策的问题不仅仅同苏联有关。这个问题具有广泛的国际意义并且最直接地涉及到世界和平的命运。如果鼓励、纵容这种政策，或者那怕是消极地对待这种政策，那么这将意味着，新战争的危险将百倍地增加。
    葛罗米柯在发言中谴责那些把自己领土提供给美国飞机起飞到苏联进行犯罪活动的国家。
    最后，葛罗米柯向会议提出了苏联的决议草案以供讨论。
    接着美国代表洛奇发言，他硬说什么美国“没有对苏联进行任何侵略行动”，并且企图证明他的论点是正确的。
    但是，美国代表的所有这些企图都是完全站不住脚的。洛奇硬说，美国飞机在苏联领空的间谍飞行不是美国的国策，而美国国务卿和美国总统在5月9日和11日的声明中已经承认这种飞行是根据美国总统的指示而实施的特别计划的一部分。
    洛奇企图为使安全理事会理事们相信，美国飞机的这种飞行是出于“美国安全”利益的正常行为。
    洛奇不但不向安全理事会作明确的肯定的回答，并且保证将停止和不再进行这种飞行，却硬说什么，美国“愿意”同苏联就缔结有关“开放天空”的间谍计划的条约进行谈判。
    安全理事会将在24日举行第二次会议。
