Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, 6th May: The full text of Premier Zhou Enlai's speech at the welcoming rally held for him today by the Royal Khmer Socialist Youth League is as follows:

Your Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk, Ladies and Gentlemen, Dear Young Friends:

Thank you to the Royal Khmer Socialist Youth League for holding such a grand gathering for us, and thank you to your representative for the speech full of friendship just now.

Modern youth, especially youth in Asian and African countries, should have aspirations, first and foremost to do their utmost to rapidly build their own countries into prosperous and progressive nations. I am very pleased to know that when His Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk founded the Royal Khmer Socialist Youth League, he stipulated that one of your tasks is to effectively and consciously participate in national construction. I am also very pleased to know that in the past three years, you have well implemented this stipulation and played an active role in promoting construction in all aspects. I wish you greater and greater achievements in the future.

Our two peoples have waged long struggles and paid a heavy price in order to win their respective national independence. We will never allow anyone to harm our national independence in any form. His Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk has formulated a policy of peace and neutrality based on Cambodia's specific situation. This policy is conducive to safeguarding Cambodia's national independence. The Chinese government has always respected and supported this policy of the Kingdom of Cambodia. However, unfortunately, as His Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk said at the airport yesterday, "Today we see some big countries preserving their past practices, only changing their colonialist and imperialist faces. We also see some not-so-large countries, which in the past were ravaged by colonialism, now accepting the mantle of imperialism and colonialism and engaging in bellicose provocations." We sternly condemn these countries for endangering world peace and the tranquility of all countries. I have noticed that the Royal Khmer Socialist Youth League regards defending the fine traditions of the Khmer nation, the heritage of its ancestors, and its ideals, namely independence and the policy of neutrality, as its glorious task. I can assure you that as you and all the Cambodian people struggle to defend national independence, you can count on the unwavering support of the 650 million Chinese people.

Dear young friends, I wish you continued victories in the noble cause of building your motherland, defending national independence, and safeguarding world peace! May the friendship between the Chinese and Cambodian peoples last forever!

Long live His Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk!

    在高棉王家社会主义青年团欢迎大会上
    周恩来总理的讲话
    新华社金边6日电　周恩来总理今天在高棉王家社会主义青年团为他举行的欢迎大会上的讲话，全文如下：尊敬的西哈努克亲王殿下，女士们，先生们，亲爱的青年朋友们：
    感谢高棉王家社会主义青年团为我们举行这样盛大的集会，感谢你们的代表先生刚才所作的充满了友谊的讲话。
    现代的青年，特别是亚非国家的青年，应该要有抱负，首先就是尽最大的力量迅速地把自己的国家建设成为繁荣进步的国家。我很高兴地知道，你们的领袖西哈努克亲王殿下在创建高棉王家社会主义青年团的时候就规定，你们的任务之一是有效地和自觉地参加国家建设。我也很高兴地知道，在过去三年中，你们很好地执行了这一条规定，在各方面的建设事业中都起了积极的推动作用。我预祝你们今后取得更多更大的成就。
    我们两国人民为了争取各自的民族独立，曾经进行过长期的斗争，付出了重大的代价。我们决不容许任何人再以任何形式损害我们的民族独立。西哈努克亲王殿下根据柬埔寨的具体情况，制定了和平中立的政策。这个政策是有利于维护柬埔寨的民族独立的。中国政府一贯尊重和支持柬埔寨王国的这个政策。但是，不幸的是，正如西哈努克亲王殿下昨天在机场所说的，“今天我们看到一些大国保存了他们过去的做法，只是改换了他们的殖民主义和帝国主义面貌而已。我们同样还看到一些不太大的国家，过去还受过殖民主义的蹂躏，现在反而接受了帝国主义、殖民主义的衣钵和进行好战性的挑衅。”我们严厉地谴责这些国家危害世界和平和各国安宁的行为。我注意到，高棉王家社会主义青年团把捍卫高棉民族的优良传统、祖先遗产及其理想，即独立和中立政策，作为自己的光荣任务。我可以向你们保证，在你们和全体柬埔寨人民为保卫民族独立而进行斗争的时候，你们可以指望六万万五千万中国人民始终不渝的支持。
    亲爱的青年朋友们，祝你们在建设祖国、捍卫民族独立和维护世界和平的崇高事业中不断地取得胜利！祝中柬两国人民的友谊万古常青！
    西哈努克亲王殿下万岁！
