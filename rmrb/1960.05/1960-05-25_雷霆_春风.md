    Thunder · Spring Breeze
    Li Yeguang
    “The Japanese people are very promising.” – Chairman Mao
This is like the angry storm of six hundred million people, driving the righteous thunder that resounds through the universe, speeding from the Yangtze River to the other side of the Pacific Ocean, to bombard the bloody den of the White House.
This is like the deep friendship of six hundred million people, transformed into a gentle and warm spring breeze, diligently floating over thousands of miles of plains and seas, to encourage the patriotic hearts of the Japanese people.
From now on, the Japanese people will be even more high-spirited, and the wildfire sweeping across Asia will be even more vigorous, because they hear the truth in their ears and are illuminated by the star of hope above their heads.
Thunder! You beat the drums and wave the flags for us,
Spring breeze! You lead us forward,
On the road of struggle, friendship, and peace,
Arm in arm with friends, fists pointing at the enemy…

    雷霆·春风
    李野光“日本人民是很有希望的。”——毛主席这好比六亿人民愤怒的风暴，驾着响彻宇宙的正义雷霆，从长江向太平洋彼岸飞驰，去轰击血腥的魔窟白宫。这好比六亿人民的深情厚谊，化作一阵柔和温暖的春风，殷勤地飘过万里平原江海，去鼓舞日本人民爱国的心。从此日本人民更加斗志昂扬，席卷亚洲的野火也更加旺盛，因为他们耳边响着真理，头上照耀着希望的明星。雷霆啊！你为我们擂鼓扬旗，春风啊！你引领着我们前进，在战斗、友谊、和平的道路上，臂膀挽着朋友，拳头指向敌人……
