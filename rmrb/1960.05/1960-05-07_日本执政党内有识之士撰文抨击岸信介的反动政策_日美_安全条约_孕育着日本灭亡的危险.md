Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 6th - News: Informed figures within the Japanese ruling party published an article in the May issue of "Sekai" magazine, openly criticizing the Kishi Nobusuke government for following the United States in implementing "Cold War" policies, and advocating that Japan take an independent, autonomous, and peaceful co-existence path.

The "Sekai" magazine editorial department added a note before the article titled "Worries about the Future of the Conservative Party - Shifting from Cold War Policy to Peaceful Coexistence Policy," written by a member of the Diet from the Liberal Democratic Party: "Now that the security treaty issue has finally reached a decisive stage, it is very noteworthy that informed figures within the ruling party are so vehemently criticizing Kishi's politics in this way."

The Liberal Democratic Party member said in the article: "Peaceful coexistence is the general trend of world politics." However, the Kishi Nobusuke faction "still stubbornly insists that the Cold War is still ongoing and has not changed, and is forcibly revising the security treaty to continue strengthening the Cold War system between Japan and Asia." He pointed out that "the Kishi Nobusuke route is dangerous and will not work."

This Diet member accused the Kishi Nobusuke faction of being "Cold War-ists." He said that the economic policy of the "Cold War-ists" externally is to strengthen the U.S.-Japan military alliance by revising the "Security Treaty," create tension with China, strengthen Japan's collusion with the Northeast Asia Treaty Organization, and act as the U.S. commander's agent in Asia to "carry out infiltration work" in Asian countries, in order to "gain economic superiority and privileges." He said: "This Kishi Nobusuke route is a newfangled version of the southward advance theory aimed at expanding markets."

The article said: "Japan's Cold War economy limits its export market to within the economic sphere of influence of the United States, and because it relies on unfavorable trade with the United States, it generates huge deficits every year. Domestically, due to the excessive burden of defense spending, the economic foundation is weak, and it can only insist on low wages. As a result, to make up for the trade deficit, it has to rely on U.S. special procurements. To remedy the technological backwardness, it imports technology recklessly. At the same time, due to the development of productive forces and the narrowness of the domestic market, it has to engage in loss-making exports, and the export market is limited to the U.S. economic sphere of influence...and so on, it's truly a vicious cycle."

The article pointed out: "Japan's economy taking the Kishi Nobusuke-style Cold War route is truly heading down a dead end."

When talking about the United States establishing military alliances with other Western countries, the article pointed out that military alliances are "a means for the United States to establish leadership in Western countries and put the politics and economy of these countries under the control of U.S. privileges." The article also pointed out that this kind of military alliance will eventually collapse.

This Diet member then criticized Kishi Nobusuke's policy of revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." He said: "Kishi Nobusuke's route of revising the Security Treaty is to continue implementing the Cold War economic policy, which has already entered a dead end, in the context of the development of a detente trend." This policy, with the entire economic decision-making power firmly in the hands of the United States, encourages the U.S. "Cold War" faction to obstruct peace, encourages the United States to launch wars, and wants to turn Japan into an accomplice in this kind of adventure.

The article emphasized: "If the international situation develops towards peace, the revised Security Treaty will become useless and harmful. If the tension intensifies, it will harbor the danger of Japan's destruction. In reality, Japan is in a situation where it will suffer both of these disasters."

This ruling party member strongly criticized Kishi Nobusuke's policy of hostility towards China. He advocated that Japan "extend a friendly and peaceful hand to China." He questioned: "Can we allow the Kishi Nobusuke faction to revise the Security Treaty, further aim its spearhead at China, and make national morality fall to the ground again?"

He also pointed out: "Kishi Nobusuke, needless to say, those leaders who revised the Security Treaty with Kishi Nobusuke and exerted efforts to establish that kind of military system and dirtied their hands, are definitely going to lose their qualifications to be the parties to break the deadlock in Japan-China relations." The Diet member finally said: "Now is the time to resolutely stop him (Kishi Nobusuke) from the foolish behavior that will bring disaster to the nation." He called on the four hundred or so Diet members of the Liberal Democratic Party to "muster their courage" to prevent the ratification of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and lead Japan towards the path of peaceful coexistence.

### 日本执政党内有识之士撰文抨击岸信介的反动政策  日美“安全条约”孕育着日本灭亡的危险

    日本执政党内有识之士撰文抨击岸信介的反动政策
    日美“安全条约”孕育着日本灭亡的危险
    敌视中国的政策会使民族道义再度扫地
    新华社6日讯　东京消息：日本执政党内的有识之士在5月号的“世界”杂志上发表文章，公开抨击岸信介政府追随美国实行“冷战”政策，并主张日本走独立自主、和平共处的道路。
    “世界”杂志编辑部在这篇由自由民主党一位国会议员撰写的题为“为保守政党的前途担忧——从冷战政策转向和平共处政策”的文章前面，特别加上按语说：“在安全条约问题终于到达决定性阶段的现在，执政党内有识之士以这种方式激烈地批判岸政治这种情况，是非常值得注意的”。
    自由民主党的这位议员在文章中说：“和平共处是世界政治潮流的大势所趋”。但是，岸信介一派“仍然硬说冷战还在进行，没有任何变化，并且强行修改安全条约，以继续加强日本和亚洲的冷战体制。”他指出，“岸信介路线是危险的，是走不通的”。
    这位议员指责岸信介派是“冷战派”。他说，“冷战派”的经济政策在对外方面是，要以修改“安全条约”来加强日美军事同盟，制造同中国的紧张局势，加强日本同东北亚条约组织的勾结，并在亚洲当上美国指挥者的代理人，对亚洲国家“进行渗透工作”，以便“取得经济上的优越地位和特权”。他说：“这条岸信介路线是换了新花样的、旨在扩大市场的南进论。”
    文章说：“日本的冷战经济把出口市场局限在美国的经济势力范围内，而且由于依靠不利的对美贸易，每年都产生巨额的赤字。在国内，由于防卫费负担过重，经济基础脆弱，只能一味坚持低工资，其结果是为了填补贸易上的赤字就要依赖美国的特需，为了补救技术上的落后状态就无计划地照搬着输入技术，同时由于生产力的发展和国内市场的狭窄，不得不大搞亏本输出，而输出市场则又限于美国经济势力范围之内，……如此等等，真是一个恶性循环。”
    文章指出：“日本经济走上岸信介式的冷战路线，真是一路往死胡同里走了。”
    在谈到美国同其他西方国家建立军事同盟问题时，文章指出，军事同盟是“美国在西方各国建立领导权，把这些国家的政治经济放在美国特权驾驭之下的一个手段。”文章并且指出，这种军事同盟终究是要崩溃的。
    这位议员接着抨击岸信介修改日美“安全条约”的政策。他说：“岸信介修改安全条约的路线是：在解冻趋势发展中，继续执行已经走进死胡同的穷途末路的冷战经济政策”。这种政策在整个经济决定权牢牢掌握在美国手里的过程中，鼓励了美国“冷战”派阻挠和平，鼓励美国发动战争，并想把日本变成进行这种冒险的同谋者。
    文章强调指出：“假如国际形势朝着和平方向发展，修改了的安全条约将成为无用而有害的东西。如果紧张局势加剧，它将孕育日本灭亡的危险，实际上日本是处在将遭受这两种灾难的形势中。”
    这位执政党议员强烈抨击了岸信介敌视中国的政策。他主张日本“向中国伸出友好与和平之手”。他质问道：“岸信介一派的人修改安全条约，进一步把矛头指向中国，使民族的道义再度扫地，这能够听之任之吗？”
    他并且指出：“岸信介自不消说，那些同岸信介一起修改安全条约，并出力建立那种军事体制而弄脏了手的领导人，是肯定会失去打开日中关系僵局的当事人的资格的。”这位议员最后说：“现在应该是坚决阻止他（岸信介）给民族带来灾难的愚蠢行为的时候了”。他呼吁自由民主党的四百多名国会议员“拿出自己的勇气”阻止批准新日美“安全条约”，使日本走向和平共处的道路。
