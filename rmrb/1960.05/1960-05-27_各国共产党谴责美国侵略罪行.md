Ceylon Communist Party General Secretary Says US Attitude in Destroying Four-Power Conference Was Extremely Bad

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, May 24: The Central Committee of the French Communist Party held a meeting yesterday in Ivry, near Paris. A resolution on the international situation was adopted at the meeting.

The resolution pointed out that forces hostile to international détente, particularly certain leading groups in the United States, have not hesitated to engage in the most dangerous provocations in order to prevent the four-power summit from taking place. The US ruling circles hope to use strength to blackmail the Soviet Union and all socialist countries that cherish peace.

The resolution pointed out that the Soviet government has fulfilled its duty to safeguard the security of its people and to maintain peace; while Eisenhower, instead of condemning the policy of provocation and aggression, approved it, thus making the summit impossible.

The resolution believes that French President de Gaulle bears a major responsibility for undermining the summit.

The resolution then emphasized that peace must be won through constant struggle.

The resolution finally called on all members and organizations of the French Communist Party to fight for the defense of peace, expose the conspiracies and tricks of the enemies of peace, and clarify all aspects of the current international situation among the French people.

The resolution pointed out: The irresistible liberation movement of the people of colonies and dependencies is booming and growing stronger, and reactionary regimes subordinate to US imperialism, such as those in South Korea, Turkey, and Japan, are in a precarious state; the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and its adaptations in the Near East or Southeast Asia have been shaken.

Raymond Guyot, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, delivered a report at the meeting on the international situation and the struggle for peace and national independence.

Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, May 23: "Red Flag" published a communiqué issued by the Political Bureau of the Belgian Communist Party on the breakdown of the four-power summit, saying that peace cannot be a deception, "negotiations cannot be held with those who take bellicose provocations as their principle."

The communiqué pointed out that the capitalist system throughout the world is in difficulty and facing economic difficulties, and US monopoly capital may want to resort to adventure again, but the days when they seemed confident of winning in a "showdown of strength" are gone forever.

Xinhua News Agency, May 25: Sydney News: Australian Communist Party General Secretary Sharkey vehemently condemned the US government for undermining the four-power summit on the evening of the 24th. He pointed out that the imperialists are trying to shirk responsibility for destroying the summit and blame it on Khrushchev, "but all the facts point out that the real culprits are the US cold war mongers." Sharkey made these remarks at a special meeting convened by the Australian Communist Party to discuss tasks in the new situation.

Sharkey pointed out that the Soviet Union's attitude at the Paris four-power summit was a great victory for peace.

He also pointed out that China has issued more than ninety warnings about US violations of its territorial waters and airspace. He said that China's achievements frighten the imperialists, who are trying to discredit it by calling it an aggressor, lest underdeveloped countries follow its example. But, he said, the world crisis of imperialism is deepening, while socialism is becoming more and more prosperous.

Sharkey said that the Australian Communist Party will more sharply expose the warmongers and strive to mobilize the people more broadly to fight for peace.

Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, May 24: Ceylon Communist Party General Secretary Pieter Keuneman wrote an article in the "Daily Sun" on the 23rd exposing the US deliberate sabotage of the four-power summit.

The article cited facts to point out that the Soviet Union did everything possible to make the summit successful, but "the leaders of the Western countries, especially the US leaders, were unwilling to do so, and the US attitude was extremely bad."

    据新华社巴黎24日电　法国共产党中央委员会昨天在巴黎附近的伊符里举行会议。会上就国际形势通过一项决议。
    决议指出，敌视国际缓和的势力，特别是美国的某些领导集团，为了使四国政府首脑会议开不成，不惜从事最危险的挑衅。美国统治集团希望用实力来讹诈抱有和平愿望的苏联和所有的社会主义国家。
    决议指出，苏联政府对维护本国人民安全和维护和平尽到了自己的职责；而艾森豪威尔，却是批准而不是谴责挑衅和侵略政策，从而使首脑会议的举行成为不可能。
    决议认为，法国总统戴高乐在破坏首脑会议方面负有重大责任。
    决议接着强调，必须通过不断的斗争来争取和平。
    决议最后号召法国共产党全体党员和各级党组织为保卫和平而斗争，揭露和平的敌人的阴谋诡计，并在法国人民中澄清当前国际形势各方面的问题。
    决议指出：殖民地和附属国人民的势不可当的解放运动方兴未艾，日益加强，从属于美帝国主义的反动政权例如在南朝鲜、土耳其和日本，已处于岌岌可危的状态；北大西洋公约及其在近东或东南亚的翻版已被动摇。
    法国共产党中央委员会政治局委员雷蒙·居约在会上作了关于国际形势、争取和平和民族独立的斗争的报告。
    据新华社布鲁塞尔23日电　“红旗报”刊载了比利时共产党政治局就四国政府首脑会议破裂发表公报说，和平不能够是欺骗，“不能够同那些把好战的挑衅行动作为他们的原则的人谈判”。
    公报指出，全世界的资本主义制度都处在困难中，面临着经济上的困难，美国垄断资本可能想再次求助于冒险，但是，他们似乎还有把握在一次“实力的较量”中得到胜利的日子已经一去不复返了。
    据新华社25日讯　悉尼消息：澳大利亚共产党总书记夏基24日晚上激烈谴责美国政府破坏四国首脑会议。他指出，帝国主义者企图推卸破坏首脑会议的罪责，并且归咎于赫鲁晓夫，“但是所有的事实指出，真正的罪犯是美国冷战贩子”。夏基是在澳大利亚共产党为讨论新形势下的任务而召开的特别会议上讲这番话的。
    夏基指出，苏联在巴黎四国首脑会议上采取的态度是和平的一个巨大胜利。
    他还指出，中国已经就美国侵犯它的领海领空发出了九十多次警告。他说，中国的成就使帝国主义者感到害怕，他们企图破坏它的名誉，说它是侵略者，唯恐不发达的国家仿效它的榜样。但是，他说，帝国主义的世界危机正越来越深，而社会主义却越来越繁荣。
    夏基说，澳大利亚共产党将更加尖锐地揭露战争贩子，努力更广泛地动员人民为争取和平而斗争。
    据新华社科伦坡24日电　锡兰共产党总书记彼得·克尼曼23日在
  “每日太阳报”上写文章揭露美国蓄意破坏四国首脑会议。
    文章列举事实指出，苏联尽一切力量使最高级会议成功，但是
  “西方国家的领袖，特别是美国领袖，不愿意这样做，而且，美国的态度是非常恶劣的”。
