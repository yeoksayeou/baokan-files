    Taking the Road of Self-Reliance

    Self-reliance means finding ways to solve problems in production by ourselves.

    Self-reliance is not just empty talk. It's not enough to simply have the desire; you need concrete methods. So, where do these methods come from? They come from the masses. As the saying goes, "One person's mind has no plan, but three people's stomachs can sing a whole opera." The "good show" of self-reliance and innovation at the Yinchuan Shoe Factory was "sung" together by all the factory's workers. When the Yinchuan Shoe Factory started its technical innovation and technical revolution, it had no raw materials, no tools, and no technicians. If it had relied on one person or a few people to do it alone, no solutions would have been found, and even if solutions were found, they wouldn't have been easy to implement. Mobilizing the masses makes everything easier. After the workers of the Yinchuan Shoe Factory were mobilized, they found waste materials and substitutes from their homes, canteens, and scrap collection stations, doing everything possible to solve the difficulty of raw materials. The difficulties of lacking tools and technicians were also solved by everyone contributing ideas, everyone pitching in, and everyone working hard and skillfully. These facts tell us that to achieve mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation in an enterprise or unit, it is not enough to rely on one person or a few people to think of ways for self-reliance. It is necessary to mobilize the broad masses and rely on the collective strength of self-reliance to achieve significant results.

### 走自力更生的道路

    走自力更生的道路
    自力更生就是自己想办法解决生产中的问题。
    自力更生不是一句空话，光有这么个愿望，没有具体办法还是不行的。那么，办法从哪里来呢？办法从群众中来。俗语说：“一人心里没有计，三人肚里唱本戏。”银川鞋工厂自力更生搞革新的“好戏”，就是全厂职工一齐“合唱”的。银川鞋工厂在开始搞技术革新和技术革命时，没有原料，没有工具，没有技工，要是叫一个人或者少数几个人撑着干，什么办法也想不出来，就是想出了办法，也不容易办到。把群众发动起来，不管什么事情都好办了。银川鞋工厂的工人发动起来以后，工人们就从家里、食堂里、废品收购站里找到了废料和代用品，千方百计解决原料的困难；没有工具，没有技工的困难，也都是大家出主意，大家动手，大家苦干巧干解决的。这些事实告诉我们：要在一个企业或一个单位实现机械化、半机械化，自动化、半自动化，光靠一个人或少数人自力更生想办法，是不行的，必须是把广大群众发动起来，依靠集体力量的自力更生，才能收到显著的效果。
