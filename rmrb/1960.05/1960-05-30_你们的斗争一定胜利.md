A Letter Sent to Japan

    Your Struggle Will Surely Be Victorious
    To my Japanese friends and sisters:
  　I extend my highest combat salute from Beijing to your unyielding and heroic struggle to smash the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.
    People all over the world are discussing two recent events, which were committed by Eisenhower and Kishi Nobusuke. On the eve of the Four-Power Summit Conference, Eisenhower sent spy planes to invade the Soviet Union for espionage and military provocations and openly declared this as its established national policy, rejecting the Soviet Union's solemn protests and reasonable demands, thereby destroying the Four-Power Summit Conference. Under the direction of the United States, Kishi Nobusuke called in 500 policemen to the House of Representatives to drive out members of the Socialist Party, Communist Party, and other opposition parties, and then, like a thief, illegally passed the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty!
    Eisenhower and Kishi Nobusuke may have thought they had done a great job. But what are the facts? As we Chinese often say, reactionaries are stupid and end up shooting themselves in the foot. Don't you see that this is exactly the case? U.S. imperialism undermined the Four-Power Summit Conference and attempted to blame the destruction of the conference on the Soviet Union. However, the Soviet people caught the U.S. imperialist fascist robbers, gave them a severe beating, thoroughly stripped off their mask of peace, and exposed their fascist robber's aggressive face to the world. Now U.S. imperialism is in a state of utter isolation, surrounded by enemies on all sides. What is Kishi Nobusuke's situation? My Japanese friends and sisters, you know better. Haven't more and more people risen up to struggle, shouting "The illegally passed U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty is invalid," and "Down with Kishi Nobusuke"? Kishi Nobusuke is truly courting death! He dares to defy the world, daring to once again trample on the will of the Japanese people and forcibly pass the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, which the Japanese people are determined to oppose to the death, in the House of Representatives!
    However, the more serious consequences are yet to come. What Eisenhower and Kishi Nobusuke did does not show their strength to the people of the world, but precisely shows that they are already in a desperate situation at the end of their rope.
    Why did Kishi Nobusuke even throw away the signboard of "parliamentary democracy" and reveal his true colors as a militarist ghoul, even relying on force to drive out opposition party members and illegally pass the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty? This precisely proves that Kishi Nobusuke has violated the will of the people, done something wrong, fears the people's struggle, and fears being overthrown. Therefore, Kishi Nobusuke wants to rely on force to save his desperate predicament and death, but the result is that it has aroused greater and more widespread popular anger, thereby accelerating his demise. What Eisenhower and Kishi Nobusuke did further exposed their essential nature as paper tigers, strong in appearance but weak in reality.
    Japanese friends, sisters! Now the issue could not be clearer. Aren't what are exposed in their true form before the people of our two countries, China and Japan, and the people of the world, two cornered beasts that everyone is shouting to kill: a desperate fascist robber and a mad dog? Now what else is there to say? Robbers rob, and mad dogs hurt people. How can this be allowed? Robbers must be caught and brought to justice, and mad dogs must be killed. It must be like this, it can only be like this! The Chinese people are like this towards U.S. and Japanese imperialism, without any ambiguity. U.S. imperialism occupies our country's territory of Taiwan and, together with the Kishi Nobusuke reactionary clique, has concluded a military alliance to openly revive Japanese militarism and attempt to launch a new war of aggression. This is impossible. The Chinese people resolutely oppose it and are ready to counterattack the aggressors at any time, giving the aggressors a devastating blow. The Kishi Nobusuke reactionary clique, in order to get its hands on our country's territory of Taiwan, turn Korea into its colony again, and relive the dream of the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," wants to drag the Japanese people into the disaster of aggressive war again and get chestnuts out of the fire for its American masters. This is absolutely unacceptable to the Japanese and Chinese people. The Japanese people's unyielding struggle has already dealt a great blow to the Kishi Nobusuke reactionary clique. The Japanese people will launch the seventeenth larger-scale national struggle, which will thoroughly defeat the Kishi Nobusuke reactionary clique.
    Now the people of the world are in an excellent situation. Japanese friends, sisters, let the people of China and Japan unite as one and resolutely defeat U.S. imperialism together with the people of the world! The 650 million Chinese people resolutely support your patriotic and just struggle. Victory will surely belong to you!

### 你们的斗争一定胜利

专栏：寄到日本去的信

    你们的斗争一定胜利
    李德全日本的朋友们、姐妹们：
  　你们正在进行不屈不挠的粉碎日美军事同盟条约的英勇斗争，我从北京谨向你们致以崇高的战斗的敬意。
    全世界的人民正在议论着最近发生的两件事，这是艾森豪威尔和岸信介干的。艾森豪威尔在四国政府首脑会议前夕派出间谍飞机侵入苏联进行间谍活动和军事挑衅，并且公然声称这是它的既定国策，拒绝苏联的严正抗议和合理要求，从而破坏了四国政府首脑会议。岸信介在美国指使下，在众议院叫进了五百名警察赶走社会党和共产党等反对党的议员，然后像贼那样非法地通过了日美军事同盟条约！
    艾森豪威尔和岸信介也许以为自己干得很得意。但是，事实是怎么样呢？我们中国人常说，反动派是愚蠢的，搬起石头来打自己的脚，你们看，事实不是正是这样吗？美帝国主义破坏四国政府首脑会议，并且企图把破坏会议的责任强加于苏联。但是，苏联人民抓住了美帝国主义法西斯强盗，狠狠地揍了一顿，彻底剥掉了它的和平假面具，使它的法西斯强盗的侵略嘴脸大白于天下。现在美帝国主义正处在四面楚歌，空前孤立的地位。岸信介的处境如何？日本的朋友们、姐妹们，你们知道得更清楚。不是已经有更多、更广泛的人民起来斗争，高喊“非法通过的日美军事同盟条约无效”、“打倒岸信介”吗？岸信介真是不要命了！他竟敢冒天下之大不韪，胆敢再次践踏日本人民的意志，武力强迫国会众议院通过日本人民誓死反对的日美军事同盟条约！
    可是，更严重的后果还在后面。艾森豪威尔和岸信介干的事，不是向全世界人民表明他们的强大，而恰恰表明了他们已经处在日暮途穷的困境。
    岸信介为什么连“议会民主”的招牌都扔掉了，而露出军国主义青面獠牙的本面目，竟然靠武力赶走反对党议员，非法通过日美军事同盟条约？这正是证明，岸信介违背了人民的意志，作了亏心事，怕人民的斗争，怕被打倒。于是，岸信介想靠武力来挽救它的绝望的困境和死亡，但结果是激起了更大更广泛的人民的愤怒，从而加速他的死亡。艾森豪威尔和岸信介所干的事更进一步暴露了他们外强中干的纸老虎的本质。
    日本的朋友们，姐妹们！现在问题摆的再清楚也没有了。在我们中日两国人民面前，在全世界人民面前原形毕露的不是人人喊打的两条困兽：不是走投无路的法西斯强盗和一条疯狗吗？现在还有什么可说的呢？强盗打劫，疯狗伤人。这怎么能允许呢？强盗必须抓住法办，疯狗必须打死。必须这样，只能这样！中国人民对美、日帝国主义就是这样，一点也不含糊。美帝国主义霸占了我国领土台湾，并且和岸信介反动集团缔结军事同盟公然复活日本军国主义，企图发动新的侵略战争。这是办不到的。中国人民坚决反对，并且随时准备反击侵略者，给侵略者以毁灭性的打击。岸信介反动集团为了染指于我国领土台湾，再变朝鲜为它的殖民地和重温“大东亚共荣圈”的迷梦，想把日本人民再次拖入侵略战争的灾难中，替美国主子火中取栗，这是日本人民和中国人民绝对不能答应的。日本人民的不屈不挠的斗争已经给岸信介反动集团以很大的打击。日本人民将要掀起第十七次规模更大的全国性斗争，将要彻底打倒岸信介反动集团。
    现在世界人民正处于大好形势之下。日本的朋友们、姐妹们，让中日两国人民团结一致和全世界人民一道坚决打倒美帝国主义！六亿五千万中国人民坚决支持你们的爱国正义斗争。胜利必将属于你们！
