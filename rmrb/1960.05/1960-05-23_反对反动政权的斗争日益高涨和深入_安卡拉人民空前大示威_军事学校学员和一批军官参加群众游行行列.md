Xinhua News Agency, May 22nd dispatch from Ankara: An unprecedented large-scale demonstration was held in Ankara, the capital of Turkey, on the 21st, against the Mandres regime, fostered by the United States. Not only students, professors, and citizens participated in the demonstration, but also military school students and high-ranking military officers.

It is reported that this military-civilian demonstration is the largest mass demonstration that has occurred in Ankara since the Turkish people began their struggle against the Mandres traitorous government. More than 1,000 military school students participated in the demonstration. Anti-government demonstrations have been going on for three consecutive days since May 19.

On the afternoon of the 21st, almost all the students of the military schools in Ankara, along with a group of senior military officers and many young officers, participated in the demonstration. Led by a general in charge of military research, they marched in formation on Ataturk Avenue, singing the National Youth March. This song has become a sacred anthem for students in Ankara and Istanbul fighting against the Mandres traitorous government.

When the demonstrating masses were marching, Ankara Martial Law Commander, General Namik Alguç, drove up in an American jeep and asked them to disband. The leader of the military school students replied, "Let us march."

Together with thousands of citizen demonstrators, they reached the Turkish Parliament Building, which is now used as the office of the Central Treaty Organization Secretariat, an aggressive military bloc controlled by the United States. There, they were blocked by a cavalry cordon. They stayed there for more than an hour, singing patriotic songs.

The demonstrators later turned back towards the city center. They shouted "Freedom" and encouraged each other with friendly calls.

Most residents greeted the demonstrators from the windows, applauding.

The demonstrators demanded the release of students arrested in previous demonstrations in front of the Army Club.

It is reported that because the military school students participated in the demonstration, the soldiers standing on street corners watched the demonstration silently without interfering. However, when the demonstrating citizens separated from the military school students and returned near the police headquarters, about a thousand policemen attacked them with tear gas grenades. Some people were arrested.

Prior to this, about two hundred medical school professors and teaching assistants held a gathering and participated in the demonstration against the Mandres regime.

It is reported that before the military school students came out to demonstrate, some army officers had been arrested, and the authorities had searched certain military facilities.

Xinhua News Agency, May 22nd dispatch from Ankara: Due to the continued outbreak of large-scale demonstrations against the Turkish dictatorial government in Ankara, the capital of Turkey, in recent days, the Ankara military authorities have further taken repressive measures today.

It is reported that the Ankara Martial Law Command issued a new order this morning, advancing the curfew from midnight to 8:00 PM. The order stated that anyone appearing on the street from 8:00 PM to 5:00 AM would be arrested. Most of the special passes issued by the Martial Law Command in the past have also been cancelled. The order prohibits gatherings of more than five people, and even five people walking together on the street are considered a violation of martial law. In all places where crowds may appear, such as cinemas, theaters, and bus stops, "people must strictly queue in order," otherwise they will also be charged with violating martial law. The military authorities also announced the commencement of censorship of all postal and telecommunications services and strict control of all radios and wireless equipment in the city. The new martial law authorizes the military police to search pedestrians or residences at any time.

The further repressive measures taken by the Turkish authorities show that the situation in Turkey has not "significantly eased" as Mandres and his American masters have said. On the contrary, it reflects that the struggle of the patriotic Turkish people against the Mandres regime, which is fostered by the United States and betrays national interests, is rising and deepening day by day. From May 19 to 21, four large-scale demonstrations occurred continuously in Ankara, with participants including not only young people and students, but also a large number of women and elderly people. Factional struggles within the Turkish ruling class have also developed. It is reported that in the unprecedented large-scale demonstration in Ankara on the 21st, not only did many soldiers and junior officers who sympathized with the people participate, but also some senior army officers participated.

    反对反动政权的斗争日益高涨和深入
    安卡拉人民空前大示威
    军事学校学员和一批军官参加群众游行行列
    新华社22日讯　安卡拉消息：土耳其首都安卡拉军民在21日举行了空前的大示威，反对美国扶植的曼德列斯政权。参加示威的不仅有学生、教授、市民，而且军事学校的学员、高级军官也参加了进来。
    据报道，这次军民示威是自土耳其人民开始反对曼德列斯卖国政府的斗争以来，在安卡拉发生的最大的一次群众示威。参加示威的军事学校的学员就有一千多人。从5月19日起，反政府的示威已经连续进行了三天。
    21日午后，几乎安卡拉所有的军事学校的学员们，和一批高级军官和许多青年军官们都参加了这次示威。他们在负责研究军事的将军的率领下在阿塔图克大街上列队前进，高唱着民族青年进行曲。这首歌已成为同曼德列斯卖国政府作斗争的安卡拉和伊斯坦布尔的学生的圣歌。
    当示威群众游行时，安卡拉戒严司令纳米克·阿尔古奇将军乘着一辆美国吉普车开来，要求他们解散。军事学校学员的领导人回答说：“让我们游行”。
    他们同数以千计的市民示威者一道，到达了土耳其议会大厦，这座大厦现在是用来作为受美国控制的侵略性军事集团中央条约组织秘书处的办公处。他们在那里被骑兵的封锁线阻挡住了。他们在那里呆了一个多小时，高唱爱国歌曲。
    示威者后来重新折向市中心。他们高呼“自由”，互相以友好的呼喊相鼓舞。
    大多数居民从窗口向示威者致意，鼓掌。
    示威者在陆军俱乐部前面要求释放在以前几次示威中被捕的学生。
    据报道，由于军事学校学员们参加了示威，站在街道角落里的士兵都不声不响地注视着示威而没有进行干涉。但是当示威的市民群众同军事学校的学员分开而回到警察总部附近的时候，大约一千名警察用催泪瓦斯手榴弹向他们袭击。有一些人被逮捕。
    在这以前，大约二百名医学院的教授和助教举行一次集会，并且参加了反对曼德列斯政权的示威。
    据报道，在军事学校学生出来示威以前，有些陆军军官已经被捕，当局对某些军事设施进行了搜查。
    新华社22日讯　安卡拉消息：由于最近几天来在土耳其的首都安卡拉又继续不断地爆发大规模的反对土耳其独裁政府的大示威，安卡拉军事当局今天进一步采取镇压措施。
    据报道，安卡拉戒严司令部今晨发布一项新的命令，把宵禁从午夜提前到下午八时开始。命令说，从下午八时到清晨五时，在街上出现的任何人都要被逮捕。戒严司令部过去所发的特别通行证也大部分被取消。命令禁止五人以上的集会，甚至五人在街上一起走路也被认为是违反戒严令。在所有可能出现人群的地方，如电影院、戏院和公共汽车站等“人们必须严格地按次序排队”，否则也要以违反戒严令论罪。军事当局并且宣布开始对一切邮电进行审查，对市内所有的收音机和无线电设备进行严格管制。新的戒严令授权军警在任何时候都可以搜查行人或住宅。
    土耳其当局所采取的进一步镇压措施说明土耳其的局势非但没有像曼德列斯及他的美国主子所说的已“显著缓和”了，相反的，却反映出土耳其爱国人民反对美国所一手扶植的、出卖民族利益的曼德列斯政权的斗争在一天一天地高涨和深入。从5月19日到21日的三天中在安卡拉就连续发生四次大示威，参加者除了青年、学生外，还有大批妇女和老年人。土耳其统治阶级内部的派系斗争也有发展。据报道，21日在安卡拉爆发的空前的大示威中不仅有很多同情人民的士兵和下级军官参加，而且也有若干高级陆军军官参加。（附图片）
