Fuzhou Dispatch: (This newspaper) learned on the 16th that Jianyang County in Fujian Province is adopting the method of factory-commune collaboration and urban-rural mutual aid to vigorously promote technological innovation and revolution, enabling industry and agriculture to promote each other. Currently, the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization in the county and commune industries, transportation, construction and other departments has greatly increased. At the same time, a number of fully automated factories and workshops have emerged, and labor productivity has increased by about two and a half times compared with the same period last year.

Jianyang County's county and commune industries, located in the mountainous area of northern Fujian, were mostly built using indigenous methods since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, and are mainly based on manual operation, with insufficient equipment and technical strength. Therefore, in leading this mass technological innovation and revolution movement, the Jianyang County Party Committee focused on factory-to-factory collaboration, unified the existing technical forces and equipment scattered in various small factories, and fought annihilation battles in one factory and one industry. This not only overcame the difficulties of insufficient equipment and technical strength in each factory, but also enabled the rapid development of various inventions to be fully promoted, achieving "one tree blooms, ten thousand trees bear fruit." In more than three months, 19 industries and more than 70 types of work throughout the county have achieved mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation and semi-automation. The first problem encountered by the county and commune industrial technology revolution was the weakness of technical strength and the shortage of raw materials. In solving the raw material problem, they actively relied on the broad masses of workers, adopted methods such as self-smelting iron and self-frying native steel, using wood instead of iron, and using iron instead of steel to build equipment. They also established a technical revolution commando station with the machine factory and motor factory as the core, to manufacture a large number of gas generators, motors and other power and other mechanical equipment for various factories, enterprises, and communes, so that the difficulties in manufacturing equipment in the technical revolution of various factories were quickly resolved. Jianyang Distillery, one of the county's key factories, in the process of vigorously carrying out the technical revolution, in addition to mobilizing all the workers of the factory to "everyone put forward suggestions, and everything engage in innovation" by the Party branch, the County Party Committee also organized the workers of 11 factories and enterprises, such as the Machine Factory, Automobile Repair Shop, Hardware Factory, and Construction Company, to help them design, manufacture, and install boilers, distiller's yeast mixers, conveyor belts, and other equipment, so that the factory realized the entire process of brewing and processing in more than 20 days. Mechanicalization and semi-mechanization.

In the technical revolution movement, the Jianyang County Party Committee also organized large-scale worker-peasant collaboration, implemented the policy of industrial revolution serving agriculture, and unified the forces of various factories and communes to vigorously carry out the agricultural technology transformation movement, first focusing on solving the heavy physical labor problems in agricultural production. After the county and commune industries were armed with new equipment, they generally demanded to broaden the avenues of production and open up raw material bases. According to this new situation, the County Party Committee vigorously organized industrial and agricultural cooperation, launched factories to be linked with communes, and in just over two months, the county and commune farm tool factories, machine factories, woodworking factories, and other factories manufactured nearly 10,000 units of water turbines, motors, processing machines, rice transplanters, and other production and processing machinery and transportation tools for various communes and production brigades; it also helped various communes establish 169 hydropower stations.

With the in-depth development of the mass technological innovation and revolution movement, the production and life of the vast urban and rural people have been renewed. After the workers of the woodworking factory realized the entire process of mechanization, the output value in two months was close to the total output value in the first half of last year. At the same time, one-third of the labor force was extracted to build a new agricultural machinery workshop, manufacturing many water turbines, traction plows, and flatbed carts to support agricultural production, making the factory a factory that could only manufacture furniture and other living utensils in the past, and became a factory that could manufacture means of production at the same time. The March 8th workshop of the Chengguan Grain Processing Factory originally required nine strong laborers to carry grain up and down every day, sweating profusely. Now that the entire process of production has been automated, only one female worker needs to adjust the machine according to the instructions of the signal light, and the amount of grain processed every day has increased from 14,000 catties in the past to 22,000 catties. In the whole county, more than 1,100 rice transplanters were popularized to replace manual rice transplanting, and the transplanting speed was increased by four or five times compared with manual transplanting. This not only ensured that the transplanting of double-cropping early rice in the county could be completed half a month earlier than the original Great Leap Forward plan, but also saved 40,000 workdays.

    建阳县社工业全力为农业服务
    厂社协作　城乡互助　全县工业劳动生产率猛增两倍半
    本报福州16日电　福建省建阳县采用厂社协作、城乡互助的办法，大搞技术革新和技术革命，使工农业相互促进。日前全县县社工业、交通运输、建筑等部门机械化、半机械化程度大大提高，同时还出现了一批全程自动化的工厂和车间，劳动生产率比去年同期跃增两倍半左右。
    地处闽北山区的建阳县县社工业，大多数是1958年大跃进以来用土法上马兴建的，以手工操作为主，设备和技术力量都感不足。因此中共建阳县委在领导这次全民性技术革新和技术革命运动中，狠抓厂与厂大协作，把分散在各个小厂的现有的技术力量和设备统一组织起来，一个工厂一个行业地大打歼灭战，因而既克服了各厂设备和技术力量不足的困难，又使各种创造发明迅速成龙配套的全面推广，作到“一树开花，万树结果”。在三个多月中，全县就有十九个行业、七十多种工种实现了机械化半机械化和自动化半自动化。县社工业技术革命首先碰到的问题是技术力量薄弱和原材料不足。他们在解决原材料问题中，积极依靠了广大职工，采用自己炼铁、自炒土钢，以木代铁、以铁代钢等办法大造设备，还以机器厂、电机厂为核心成立技术革命突击站，为各工厂企业和公社突击制造大批煤气机、电动机等动力和其他机械设备，使各厂在大搞技术革命中制造设备的困难迅速得到解决。全县重点工厂之一的建阳酒厂，在大闹技术革命时，除了由党支部发动全厂职工“人人提建议，事事闹革新”外，县委还组织了机器厂、汽车保修厂、五金厂和建筑公司等十一个工厂企业的职工，帮助他们设计、制造和安装锅炉、拌粬机、传送带等设备，使这个厂在二十多天中就实现了酿酒加工全程机械化、半机械化。
    在技术革命运动中，中共建阳县委还组织了工农大协作，贯彻工业革命为农业服务的方针，统一组织各工厂和公社的力量，大力开展农业技术改造运动，首先集中解决农业生产方面的笨重体力劳动问题。县社工业用新设备武装起来以后，普遍要求广开生产门路、开辟原料基地。县委根据这个新形势，大力组织工农业协作，发动工厂与公社挂钩，仅两个多月，各县社农具厂、机器厂、木器厂等工厂为各公社和生产大队制造了近万部水轮机、电动机、加工机、插秧机等生产加工机械和运输工具；还帮助各公社建立了一百六十九个水力动力站。
    随着全民性技术革新和技术革命运动的深入展开，已使广大城乡人民的生产和生活面貌一新。木器厂职工实现全程机械化后，两个月中的产值即接近于去年上半年的产值总和，同时还抽出了三分之一的劳力，新建了一个农业机械车间，制造了许多水轮机、牵引犁和板车支援农业生产，使这个厂由过去仅能制造桌椅等生活用具的工厂，变成能同时制造生产资料的工厂。城关粮食加工厂三八车间，原来要用九个强劳力每天累得满头大汗地搬上搬下加工粮食，现在实现了生产全程自动化后，只要一个女工根据信号灯的指示开关调整机器，每天加工的粮食就由过去一万四千斤增加到二万二千斤。全县各公社在推广了一千一百多部插秧机代替手工插秧，插秧速度比手工提高了四、五倍，不但保证了全县双季早稻插秧能比原订大跃进计划提早半个月完成，同时还节省了四万个劳动日。
