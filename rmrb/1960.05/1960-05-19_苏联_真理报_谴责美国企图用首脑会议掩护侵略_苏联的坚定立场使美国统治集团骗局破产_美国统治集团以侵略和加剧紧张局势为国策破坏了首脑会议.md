Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 18th: The Soviet "Pravda" published an editorial today stating that Soviet Premier Khrushchev's statement exposed the hypocrisy of all those who tried every means to sabotage the summit negotiations. The US ruling clique, using the summit as a cover, attempted to make people of all countries lose their vigilance. The Soviet government's frank, sincere, and unwavering stance on the summit has resulted in the political bankruptcy of the US leaders in the eyes of all peace-loving people.

The editorial, entitled "Cannot Deceive the People of All Countries," wrote that no one can shift the responsibility for disrupting the Paris summit to the Soviet Union.

The editorial said that the Soviet Union, which had made the greatest efforts and determination to convene this summit of great powers, went to the meeting with a frank mind. The Soviet Union had long and seriously prepared for the meeting with the other side and prepared a series of proposals to be submitted to the Paris meeting, all of which were aimed at removing obstacles on the road to peace and international cooperation between countries.

However, as the opening date of the meeting approached, it became clear that the US ruling clique was again not serious about solving the most important international issues. They launched a propaganda campaign aimed at undermining the summit and harming people's belief in the possibility of peaceful coexistence between countries. On the eve of the Paris meeting, US warmongers, with the consent of the US government, sent reconnaissance planes to invade Soviet territory to carry out espionage missions. As everyone knows, one of these aerial bandits has been shot down by the Soviet rocket forces.

The editorial said that the Soviet government quite rightly believes that this US action is perfidious and incompatible with the minimum requirements for maintaining normal relations between countries in peacetime. Like the people of all countries around the world, the Soviet people are indignant at the direct aggression committed by US warmongers against the Soviet Union, and the Soviet people have the right to expect Washington to take the necessary measures to prevent such provocative actions that endanger the cause of peace from happening again. However, the US government not only did not condemn the rampant warmongers, but also claimed that reconnaissance flights by US aircraft in Soviet airspace were and will continue to be US policy.

The editorial went on to emphasize that when one of the participants in the Paris meeting—the United States—openly declared that invading the territory of another participant in the meeting—the Soviet Union—with aircraft for espionage and sabotage purposes was its national policy, the summit was doomed to failure in advance. The editorial pointed out that, of course, the Soviet government could not conduct fruitful negotiations at the summit until the US government publicly condemned the US military aircraft's invasion of Soviet airspace, publicly expressed regret for the invasion, punished the criminals, and guaranteed that such invasions would not be repeated in the future. In this case, the negotiations would only be a facade to cover up deception to all mankind. The Soviet government was unwilling to conduct such negotiations, which were clearly doomed to fail.

The editorial pointed out that US President Eisenhower did not follow wise advice to condemn the intolerable provocative actions of US aircraft against the Soviet Union and punish the direct perpetrators of this incident. In response to Khrushchev's appeal, he once again defended the "necessity of espionage," insisting that espionage was necessary to ensure "US security." In this way, the US rulers shamelessly confirmed that aggression against another major power and exacerbating tensions in relations between countries is their national policy. Moreover, as can be seen from Eisenhower's statement on May 16, the United States is prepared to use the United Nations to turn its premeditated provocation and deliberate brutal destruction of international law and national sovereignty into international norms, and the United States is attempting to gather intelligence under the protection of "international forces."

The editorial said that world public opinion fully supports the Soviet government's just demand that the US government abandon its provocative policy.

    苏联“真理报”谴责美国企图用首脑会议掩护侵略
    苏联的坚定立场使美国统治集团骗局破产 
    美国统治集团以侵略和加剧紧张局势为国策破坏了首脑会议
    新华社18日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联“真理报”今天发表社论说，苏联政府首脑赫鲁晓夫的声明，揭穿了那些想尽一切办法破坏首脑谈判的人的一切伪善面目。美国统治集团用首脑会议作掩护，企图使各国人民失去警惕性。苏联政府对首脑会议的坦率、真诚和坚定不移的立场，使美国的头目在所有爱好和平的人民的面前遭到了政治上的破产。
    这篇题为“不能欺骗各国人民”的社论写道，任何人都不能把美国政府因破坏巴黎首脑会议而应承担的责任转嫁给苏联。
    社论说，为召开这次大国政府首脑会议尽了最大努力、下了最大决心的苏联，是以坦率的心情前去参加会议的。苏联曾经长时期认真地准备了同对方的会晤，准备好了提交给巴黎会议讨论的一系列建议，这些建议都是为了扫除通往和平和各国之间进行国际合作的途径上的障碍。
    但是，随着会议开幕日期的临近，可以明显地看出，美国统治集团又打算认真地解决最重要的国际问题。他们掀起了旨在破坏首脑会议、伤害人们对于国与国之间有可能和平共处的信念的宣传运动。在巴黎会议前夕，美国黩武主义者在美国政府同意下派遣了侦察机侵入苏联境内执行间谍任务。大家知道，这些空中强盗中的一个已经被苏联火箭部队击落了。
    社论说，苏联政府完全公正地认为，美国的这种行动是背信弃义的，是同和平时期维持各国之间正常关系的起码要求不相容的。像全世界各国人民一样，苏联人民对于美国黩武主义者对苏联采取直接侵略的行为感到愤慨，苏联人民有权希望华盛顿采取必要措施，防止再发生这种危害和平事业的挑衅行动。然而，美国政府不仅没有谴责猖狂的黩武主义者，而且还声称，美国飞机在苏联领空进行侦察飞行过去和今后都是美国的既定政策。
    社论接着强调说，当巴黎会议的参加者之一——美国公然宣称抱着间谍破坏目的的飞机侵入会议另一参加国——苏联的国境是它的国策的时候，在这种情况下，首脑会议事先就注定是要失败的。社论指出，当然，在美国政府没有公开谴责美国军用飞机入侵苏联领空的行为、对这次入侵公开表示遗憾、惩办罪犯并保证今后不再重演这种入侵行为之前，苏联政府不可能在首脑会议上进行有成效的谈判。在这种情况下，谈判只会是一种幌子，用以掩饰对全人类的欺骗。苏联政府不愿意进行这种显然注定要失败的谈判。
    社论指出，美国总统艾森豪威尔并没有遵循明智的劝告，来谴责美国飞机对苏联采取的不可容忍的挑衅行为，并惩办这件事件的直接祸首。他在回答赫鲁晓夫发出的呼吁时再次为“间谍活动的必要性”作辩解，硬说间谍活动是保障“美国安全”所必需的。这样一来，美国统治者们便无耻地证实了，对另一个大国进行侵略活动和加剧各国关系中的紧张局势，是他们的国策。而且，从艾森豪威尔5月16日的声明中可以看出，美国准备利用联合国来把蓄谋的挑衅和蓄意粗暴地破坏国际法和国家主权的政策变为国际准则，美国企图在“国际力量”的庇护下收集间谍情报。
    社论说，世界公众完全支持苏联政府的公正要求，要求美国政府放弃它的挑衅政策。
