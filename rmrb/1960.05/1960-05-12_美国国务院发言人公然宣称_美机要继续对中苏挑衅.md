Xinhua News Agency, 11th dispatch from Washington: U.S. State Department Spokesman, White, spoke to reporters on the 10th, backing up accomplices such as Japan and Turkey, and stated that U.S. aircraft will continue to conduct espionage flights over the Soviet Union and China.

A reporter asked White to comment on Khrushchev’s warning on the 9th to countries hosting U.S. military bases, stating that if they allow aircraft to violate Soviet territory from their bases, the Soviet Union will strike those bases. In response, White slanderously accused the Soviet Union's solemn warning to protect its sovereignty and security as "intimidation" and "threats" to "smaller countries." He clamored that the United States would fulfill its "common defense" obligations to these countries.

White also issued a statement attempting to deny that U-2 aircraft from U.S. bases in Japan were engaged in espionage activities in order to alleviate the Japanese people's resentment and accusations against the United States and the Nobusuke Kishi government. He said, "The U.S. government has assured the Japanese government that the flights of U.S. U-2 aircraft taking off from air bases in Japan have always been and will continue to be used only for legitimate and normal purposes, and not for cross-border intelligence gathering missions." But when asked whether his statement also applied to U-2 flights from Okinawa and Taiwan, he implied that the United States "will not close its eyes to sudden attacks from any side."

### 美国国务院发言人公然宣称  美机要继续对中苏挑衅

    美国国务院发言人公然宣称
    美机要继续对中苏挑衅
    新华社11日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院发言人怀特10日对新闻记者发表谈话，为日本、土耳其等帮凶撑腰，并表示美国飞机将继续对苏联和中国进行间谍性飞行。
    有记者请怀特就赫鲁晓夫9日向设有美国军事基地的国家提出的这样的警告发表意见，就是如果它们允许飞机从它们的基地侵犯苏联领土，苏联就将打击这些基地。怀特在回答时竟诬蔑苏联这种为了保护自己的主权和安全而提出的严正警告是“恫吓”和“威胁”“较小的国家”。他叫嚷什么美国将履行它对这些国家的“共同防务”义务。
    怀特还发表声明力图否认美国驻日本基地的Ｕ—2型飞机从事间谍活动，以缓和日本人民对美国和岸信介政府的愤懑和指责。他说，“美国政府已向日本政府提出保证：从在日本的空军基地起飞的美国Ｕ—2型飞机的飞行一直是而且将继续是只用来从事合法和正常的目的，而不是用来从事搜集情报的越界飞行任务”。但是当有人问他的声明是否也适用于从冲绳和台湾起飞的Ｕ—2型飞机的飞行时，他却含意明显地说什么美国“不会闭着眼睛不看来自任何方面的突然袭击”。
