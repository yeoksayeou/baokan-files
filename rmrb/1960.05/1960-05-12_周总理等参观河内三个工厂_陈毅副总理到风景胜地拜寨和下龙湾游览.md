Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 10th: Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi, accompanied by Premier Pham Van Dong, visited the Hanoi Thang Long Cigarette Factory, the Kim Star Rubber Factory, and the Hanoi Soap Factory, which were built with Chinese assistance, this afternoon. They were warmly welcomed by the workers of these three factories.

After the visit, Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi attended a joint welcome meeting held by the three factories. Ha Van Bang, the director of the Hanoi Soap Factory, delivered a welcome speech on behalf of the workers of the three factories, thanking the Chinese government and Chinese experts for their assistance. He pledged to manage the factories well and carry out production in a faster, better, and more economical way.

Premier Zhou Enlai then addressed the workers. In his speech, Premier Zhou warmly congratulated the successful construction and smooth production of the three factories, and conveyed the respect of the Chinese people and the Chinese working class to the Vietnamese people and the Vietnamese working class. Premier Zhou said that China's assistance to Vietnam was very small. The completion of these three factories was mainly due to the achievements made by the Vietnamese people under the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party and the government. Premier Zhou emphasized that with the labor of the Vietnamese people and the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party, anything can be done. Not only three factories, but thirty, three hundred, or three thousand factories can be built. You will certainly build your motherland, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, into a more prosperous and strong nation.

Premier Zhou encouraged the Chinese experts and workers working in these three factories not to be arrogant and to help their Vietnamese comrades learn technology well. Premier Zhou said that China and Vietnam are fraternal countries as close as brothers. We should help each other and learn from each other.

Premier Zhou's speech was constantly interrupted by warm applause. Finally, all the workers cheered together with Premier Zhou: "Long live the Democratic Republic of Vietnam!" "Long live the People's Republic of China!" "Long live the eternal and unbreakable friendship between China and Vietnam!"

Premier Pham Van Dong also spoke at the meeting. He said that the Vietnamese people will certainly be able to do as Premier Zhou Enlai said, build thousands of factories, and build socialism in Vietnam. He said that this is for the good life of the Vietnamese people, to strengthen the power of North Vietnam, and to achieve the reunification of the country.

At the end of his speech, Premier Pham Van Dong quoted a Vietnamese proverb "When eating fruit, don't forget the person who planted the tree," to express his deep gratitude to the Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese government, and the Chinese experts. He then stepped down from the stage and warmly shook hands with the Chinese experts. A group of female workers presented flowers to the Chinese experts.

Director Ha Van Bang, on behalf of the above three factories and the Hanoi Machine Factory, presented some of their products to Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi. Premier Zhou Enlai also presented gifts to these four factories, including Shanghai-made radios and Chinese painting albums.

Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi visited the above three factories at 4:30 p.m. Le Thanh Nghi, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party and Minister of Industry, and the leading cadres of the three factories warmly welcomed the Chinese guests at the entrance of the factories. Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi carefully visited the main workshops of the three factories and had cordial conversations with the workers.

The workers were extremely excited about the arrival of the Chinese guests. Each workshop was filled with red banners, and each machine was adorned with small red flags and colorful bouquets.

Vice Premier Chen Yi then addressed the masses. On behalf of Premier Zhou Enlai and all accompanying personnel, he extended a lofty revolutionary salute to the people of Hong Quang District. He also congratulated the Vietnamese people on their achievements in building their motherland and wished the people of Hong Quang District to play a greater role in Vietnam's socialist construction.

Today, when Vice Premier Chen Yi and others passed through cities and towns such as Hai Phong and Hai Duong on their way to Bai Chai, local people set up colorful arches and hung red flags along the road to welcome the Chinese guests.
