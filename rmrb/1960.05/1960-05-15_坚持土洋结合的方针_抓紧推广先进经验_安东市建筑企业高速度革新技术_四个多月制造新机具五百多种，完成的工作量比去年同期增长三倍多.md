Adhere to the Policy of Combining Indigenous and Foreign Methods, Seize the Opportunity to Promote Advanced Experiences
Andong City Construction Enterprises Rapidly Innovate Technology
More than 500 New Machines Manufactured in Over Four Months; Workload Completed Increased by More Than Three Times Compared to the Same Period Last Year

(Reported by this newspaper) Construction and installation departments in Andong City, Liaoning Province, are rapidly innovating technology. By May 10th, they had basically achieved mechanized and semi-mechanized construction, established 75 automatic production lines and 79 linked production lines, achieved single-machine automation of 240 units, and manufactured 534 types of machines, such as automatic lifting vertical and horizontal bricklaying platforms, bricklaying machines, plastering machines, and excavators, totaling 2,108 units (pieces). Due to vigorously promoting technological innovation and technological revolution, 1,585 laborers were saved, of which 45% were invested in expanded reproduction, 20% engaged in building material production, 15% engaged in scientific and technological research, and 20% participated in new project construction. By early May, the city's completed construction workload increased by 337.9% compared to the same period last year; the daily output value of construction and installation workers increased by 320% compared to the same period last year.

Now, the production outlook of Andong City's construction departments has undergone fundamental changes. In woodworking trades, the processes of cutting, planing, drilling, mortising, and shaping used to rely on axes, chisels, adzes, and planes. Now, several machines link more than a dozen processes into an automatic line, where raw materials are fed in at one end and components come out at the other. Concrete mixing and mortar mixing used to be done by shoulder carrying, manual lifting, and shovel stirring. Now, from feeding materials to mixing and transporting, it has been linked into an automatic line. The derusting, cold drawing, cutting, bending, and transporting processes of the steel bar trade used to be manual operation and semi-mechanization. Now, five processes are linked into an automatic line. The scaffolding used for thousands of years has also been replaced by electric lifting platforms, saving scaffolding poles and planks, and reducing the heavy physical labor of scaffolders. The workers sang in praise: "For thousands of years, carrying poles bent our backs, sweat pouring down; now we sit in chairs and press buttons, free and at ease; thousands of pounds rise into the sky in an instant, all thanks to the good leadership of the Party."

Self-reliance, starting from scratch, making do with whatever is available, and combining indigenous and foreign methods are prominent features of the rapid technological innovation in Andong City's construction departments. In order to accelerate the advance towards mechanization and automation, the construction workers self-reliantly established repair and manufacturing networks, ensuring that large items were made by the company, small items and repair work were done on the construction site, and simple wooden equipment was made by the workers themselves. In the technological revolution, the No. 2 Construction Site of the Municipal Construction Engineering Company needed an instrument. This was a precision product that was not easy to buy. This construction site, through the "three-way combination" of leaders, workers, and engineering technicians, and in the spirit of combining indigenous and foreign methods and self-reliance, successfully trial-produced this instrument using a broken clock. The carpenters of the No. 3 Construction Site further used wooden boards and copper wires to make such a local instrument overnight, replacing foreign equipment and solving major problems. In the process of realizing 4,150 innovation proposals, the Municipal Construction Engineering Company, the largest construction department in Andong City, manufactured 119 types of machinery, totaling 439 units (pieces), without asking the state for equipment or investment. They all relied on self-reliance, internal excavation and external searches, indigenous methods, and vigorously using substitute materials to solve problems.

In the technological innovation and technological revolution movement, the Andong Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and party committees at all levels strengthened ideological and organizational leadership and organized large-scale cooperation. The broad masses of workers, as well as their family members, participated in this movement, thus rapidly creating outstanding achievements.

In order to enable the technological innovation and technological revolution movement in the city's construction departments to achieve a large-scale harvest and rapidly transform individual and partial advanced levels into universal levels, since March of this year, the Andong Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has been focusing on the work of large-scale consolidation, large-scale popularization, large-scale promotion, large-scale improvement, and large-scale development. In the previous period, this work was mainly carried out through observation and promotion teams. This team was both a "sowing team" and a "promotion team": organizing observations to spread experience, organizing supporting selections to determine types, organizing cooperation to exchange resources, and organizing large-scale promotion in accordance with local conditions, playing the role of "seeking experience," "delivering treasures," and grasping both ends to drive the middle. Because the promotion team was composed of personnel drawn from various enterprises, they promoted others during the day and returned to their own units to spread experience in the evening, thus promoting themselves while promoting others. Recently, new developments have taken place in the work of large-scale popularization and large-scale improvement. This is through the form of "sports meets" to concentrate various types of machinery, conduct large-scale performances and large-scale competitions, and further select, determine types, organize supporting facilities, and vigorously promote them through mass appraisal. At present, all construction sites in the city have put down scaffolding and universally use automatic lifting vertical and horizontal bricklaying platforms. Because one hand grasps popularization and the other hand grasps improvement, from simple to refined, from crude to sharp, from low to high, from imperfect to gradually perfect, the development of productive forces has been greatly promoted.

    坚持土洋结合的方针　抓紧推广先进经验  
    安东市建筑企业高速度革新技术
    四个多月制造新机具五百多种，完成的工作量比去年同期增长三倍多
    本报讯　辽宁省安东市建筑施工部门高速度革新技术。到5月10日止，已经基本实现施工机械化、半机械化，建立了自动线七十五条，联动线七十九条，实现单机自动化二百四十台，制造出自动升降纵横砌砖作业台、砌砖机、抹砖机、挖土机等机具五百三十四种、两千一百零八台（件）。由于大搞技术革新和技术革命，节省劳动力一千五百八十五名，其中有45％投入了扩大再生产，20％从事建筑材料生产，15％从事科学技术研究，20％参加了新项目的建设。到5月上旬，全市完成的施工工作量比去年同时期增长了337.9％；建筑安装工人日产值比去年同时期增长320％。
    现在，安东市建筑施工部门的生产面貌已经发生了根本性的变化。木作工种的截料、刨光、打眼、开榫、成型等工序，过去用的是锛、凿、斧、刨，现在用几部机器将十几道工序联成一条自动线，一头入料，一头就可以出部件。混凝土搅拌和砂浆搅拌，过去是肩挑人抬，铁锹搅，现在从上料、搅拌，一直到运输，已经联成一条自动线。钢筋工种的除锈、冷拉、切断、煨弯、运输等工序，过去是手工操作和半机械化，现在是五道工序联成一条自动线。千年沿用的脚手架，也为电动升降作业台所代替，节约了脚手杆子和跳板，减轻了架工的笨重体力劳动。广大工人歌颂道：“千年扁担压弯腰，汗水滔滔；如今坐椅按电钮，自在逍遥；霎时千斤起高空，全靠党的领导好。”
    自力更生，白手起家，因陋就简，洋土结合，是安东市建筑施工部门高速度革新技术的一个显著特点。为了加速向机械化、自动化进军，建筑工人们自力更生建立了修造网，做到大件由公司做，小件和修配活由工地做，木制简易设备工人普遍做。市建筑工程公司二工地在技术革命中，需要一种仪表。这是一种不容易买到的精密产品。这个工地通过领导、工人、工程技术员“三结合”，本着洋土结合、自力更生的精神，利用一台破挂钟试制成功了这种仪表。三工地木工更进一步利用木板和铜丝，仅用一夜的时间，做了这样一种土仪器，代替了洋设备，解决了大问题。安东市最大的施工部门——市建筑工程公司在实现四千一百五十项革新建议的过程中，制造了一百一十九种、四百三十九台（件）机械，没有向国家要过设备和投资，都是靠自力更生，内挖外找，土法上马，大搞代用料的方法解决问题的。
    在技术革新和技术革命运动中，中共安东市委和各级党委加强了思想和组织领导，组织开展了大协作。广大职工以及职工家属等都投入了这一运动，因而迅速创造了出色的成就。
    为了使全市建筑施工部门的技术革新、技术革命运动获得大面积丰收，迅速地使个别的、局部的先进水平变为普遍的水平，从今年3月份以来，中共安东市委狠抓了大巩固、大普及、大推广、大提高、大发展的工作。在前一个时期，这项工作主要是通过观摩促进队进行的。这个队既是“播种队”，又是“推广队”：组织观摩传播经验，组织配套选精定型，组织协作互通有无，因地制宜地组织大推广，起到了“取经”、“送宝”和抓两头带中间的作用。由于促进队是抽调各企业的人员组成的，白天促进别人，晚上就回到本单位传播经验，因而在促进别人的同时，也促进了自己。最近，大普及、大提高的工作又有新发展，这就是通过“运动会”的形式，集中各种类型的机具，进行大表演，大竞赛，通过群众鉴定，进一步选精定型、组织配套、大力推广。目前，市内各建筑工地已全部放下了脚手架，普遍运用自动升降纵横砌砖作业台。由于一手抓普及，一手抓提高，由简到精，由粗到尖，由低到高，由不完善到逐步完善，大大促进了生产力的发展。
