Xinhua News Agency, May 21st Dispatch from Ankara: According to news from Ankara, on the evening of the 20th, another mass demonstration of tens of thousands erupted in Ankara against the traitorous Menderes regime. The demonstration broke out in Ankara's Kizilay Square. At the time, Menderes and Indian Prime Minister Nehru, who was visiting Turkey, were driving through the square.

This was the third mass demonstration in Ankara in two days.

According to reports, approximately 30,000 people gathered between Kizilay Square and Sihhiye Square, most of whom had been mobilized by the government to welcome Nehru, who arrived in Ankara that day.

As the motorcade of Menderes and Nehru approached Kizilay Square, students and some members of the crowd began to laugh derisively and sing songs against the government. They were immediately attacked by thugs hired by the government and members of Menderes' Democratic Party who were transported in trucks. Demonstrators engaged in heroic hand-to-hand combat with these government-hired thugs.

Just after the Turkish Prime Minister and the Indian Prime Minister's cars passed by, police threw tear gas grenades at the demonstrating masses.

According to one report, more than twenty people were arrested, including some women, and fifteen others were injured.

According to Agence France-Presse, the demonstrators originally intended to break through the cordon before Nehru passed by and sit down in the street to block the passage of official vehicles.

Nehru arrived in Turkey from Cairo for a four-day visit.

It is reported that demonstrations against the traitorous Menderes government also occurred in Istanbul on the 19th.

    土政府动员欢迎尼赫鲁的群众变成反独裁巨流
    安卡拉又爆发万人大示威
    警察掷催泪瓦斯手榴弹　示威者同政府打手展开搏斗
    新华社21日讯　据安卡拉消息；20日晚上安卡拉又一次爆发反对曼德列斯卖国政权的万人大示威。示威是在安卡拉的卡齐莱广场爆发的。当时曼德列斯和前来土耳其访问的印度总理尼赫鲁正乘车经过广场。
    这是两天来在安卡拉爆发的第三次群众示威。
    据报道，当时大约有三万人聚集在卡齐莱广场和西希耶广场之间，其中大部分是政府动员来欢迎当天到达安卡拉的尼赫鲁的。
    当曼德列斯和尼赫鲁的汽车长列驶近卡齐莱广场的时候，学生和一部分群众开始发出轻蔑的笑声，高唱反对政府的歌曲。他们立即遭到政府用卡车载运来的雇来的流氓和曼德列斯的民主党人的袭击。示威者对这些政府雇用的打手们展开了英勇的搏斗。
    土耳其总理和印度总理的汽车刚刚驶过去，警察就向示威群众掷催泪瓦斯手榴弹。
    据一则消息说，有二十多人被捕，其中包括一些妇女，另外有十五人受伤。
    据法新社报道，示威者原来打算在尼赫鲁经过以前，突破警戒线，在大街上席地而坐，阻止官方汽车的通过。
    尼赫鲁是从开罗到土耳其作为期四天的访问的。
    据报道，在伊斯坦布尔19日也发生了反对曼德列斯卖国政府的示威。
