Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, 28th - Cuban President Dorticos stated at a press conference here this morning that "the US government's decision to cease 'aid' to Cuba is another aggressive measure against our country."

He said that when the powerful United States withdrew this insignificant aid of less than two hundred thousand dollars, Cuba, an underdeveloped small country often subjected to aggression by this great power, while its entire people are enduring sacrifices and striving to develop an independent economy, decided to allocate one million dollars to relieve the victims of the Chilean disaster. Cuba has already begun sending various relief supplies to Chilean victims by air and sea.

Speaking of establishing trade and diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, Dorticos said, "We have the right to establish relations with countries all over the world as long as such relations are beneficial; this is the foundation of the revolutionary government's independent foreign policy and the right of a sovereign state." He added that Cuba's relations with the Soviet Union are friendly and will become increasingly so. He said, "This does not mean that the Cuban government is a communist government." He pointed out: Does the US government not also maintain diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union? Why can't Cuba do the same?

Dorticos also condemned the US air raids on Cuba.

Dorticos also pointed out that traitors to the Cuban revolution and Batista elements freely travel in the United States and freely purchase weapons to oppose the Cuban revolution. This is because "certain US interest groups are foolishly attempting to use Batista's murderers and thugs to invade Cuba, who have received distinguished reception and delivered speeches in the US Senate Committee."

Dorticos condemned the media propaganda that distorts the true situation in Cuba, pointing out that they are intensifying propaganda against the Cuban revolution in order to prepare for military intervention against Cuba through the Organization of American States under the pretext of "anti-communism." He said, "However, in Cuba, the revolution will never be eliminated unless the entire Cuban people are exterminated. Cuba is standing tall and fighting. We have the support of people from all countries." He said that Cuba has become an example for Latin America because, despite the pressure from a foreign power, it has implemented a profound revolution. He said: "We hope that our struggle can inspire the people of all Latin American countries."

Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, 26th - Cuban President Dorticos delivered a speech this afternoon to three thousand listeners at the Argentine Economic College, exposing a series of US interference and aggression against Cuba. The audience warmly cheered the Cuban President's speech and held a demonstration parade after the speech.

He said that because Cuba implemented land reform, the United States began to obstruct it, attempting to abolish the land reform. But Cuba's response was that Cuban laws should be made by Cuba. As a result, the United States launched an aggressive campaign against Cuba through diplomatic channels, threatening economically, exerting international pressure, launching newspaper slander propaganda, sending US planes to carry out provocative activities against Cuba, refusing to sell weapons to Cuba, and forcing other countries not to sell them either.

Dorticos said, "We want to maintain relations with all countries in the world, including the United States, on the basis of equality, mutual respect and mutual benefit," but the US Congress has proposed a bill to reduce the US quota for purchasing Cuban sugar. Dorticos pointed out that despite the United States' crazy interference, "we have overcome old habits. In the past, a Cuban president should have gone to the United States, but now he voluntarily visits Latin American countries."

Dorticos said that Cuba is in danger of being invaded at any time, but "the Cuban people would rather sacrifice their lives than lose their freedom." At this time, the audience shouted, "In that case, Argentine volunteers would rather sacrifice themselves too."

The Cuban President's speech was greeted with cheers from the audience. They shouted "Long live Cuba," "Long live Fidel Castro," "Cuba yes, Yankees no," "Argentinians, Cuba is (our) path," and other slogans. After Dorticos' speech, the crowd held a demonstration parade in the central streets of Buenos Aires.

The Cuban President was also welcomed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Monjardin, and members of parliament at the Argentine Congress this afternoon. In a brief impromptu speech, he said that for the first time, Cuba has full justice and satisfies the people's demands. He emphasized the importance of the support of the people of Latin American countries for the Cuban revolution.

    古巴总统访问阿根廷发表讲话
    美国停止“援助”是又一侵略措施
    古巴人民宁愿牺牲生命不愿丧失自由
    新华社布宜诺斯艾利斯28日电  古巴总统多尔蒂科斯今天上午在这里举行的记者招待会上说，“美国政府决定停止对古巴的‘援助’是对我国的又一侵略措施。”
    他说，当强大的美国撤销它不到二十万美元的这一微不足道的援助时，古巴，这个不发达的、经常受到这个大国侵略的小国，在全体人民正为发展独立的经济而忍受牺牲、努力奋斗的同时，决定为救济智利灾民拨出一百万美元的款项。古巴已经开始从空中和海上向智利灾民送去了各种救济品。
    多尔蒂科斯在谈到与苏联建立贸易和外交关系时说，“我们有权与全世界的国家建立关系，只要这种关系是有利的；这就是革命政府的独立外交政策的基础，是主权国的权利。”他又说，古巴与苏联的关系是友好的，并将日益更加友好。他说，“这并不是说古巴政府是共产主义的政府。”他指出：难道美国政府不也是与苏联保持着外交关系吗？为什么古巴不能这样做？
    多尔蒂科斯还谴责了美国飞机对古巴的空袭。
    多尔蒂科斯还指出：古巴革命的叛徒和巴蒂斯塔分子在美国自由地通行，自由地购买反对古巴革命的武器。这是因为“某些美国利益集团愚蠢地企图利用巴蒂斯塔的杀人犯和暴徒来侵略古巴，这些人在美国国会参议院委员会受到了尊贵的接待并发表了演说”。
    多尔蒂科斯谴责歪曲古巴真实情况的报界的宣传，他指出，他们加紧进行反对古巴革命的宣传，以便准备在“反共产主义”的借口下通过美洲国家组织对古巴进行军事干涉。他说，“但是，在古巴，如果不是消灭了古巴全体人民，革命决不会被消灭。古巴正屹立着进行斗争。我们有各国人民的支持。”他说，古巴由于尽管受到了一个外国强国的压力，还是实行了深刻的革命，成为了拉丁美洲的榜样。他说：“我们期望，我们的斗争能够鼓舞拉丁美洲各国人民。”
    新华社布宜诺斯艾利斯26日电
  古巴总统多尔蒂科斯今天下午在阿根廷经济学院向三千名听众发表演说，揭露美国对古巴进行的一系列干涉和侵略行动。听众对古巴总统的演说热烈欢呼，并且在演说结束后举行了示威游行。
    他说，由于古巴实行土地改革，美国一开始就进行阻挠，企图取消土地改革。但是古巴的回答是，古巴的法律要由古巴来制订。于是美国就发动了对古巴的通过外交途径的侵略性运动，在经济上进行威胁、施加国际压力，发动报刊诽谤宣传，派美国飞机对古巴进行挑衅活动，拒绝把武器卖给古巴，并且迫使其他国家也不卖。
    多尔蒂科斯说，“我们想在平等、互相尊重和互利的基础上同包括美国在内的世界上所有的国家保持关系”，但是，美国国会却提出了削减美国购买古巴食糖定额的法案。多尔蒂科斯指出，尽管有美国的疯狂干涉，“我们却战胜了旧习惯。在以前，一个古巴总统应该到美国去，可是现在他却自愿到拉丁美洲国家访问。”
    多尔蒂科斯说，古巴有随时遭受入侵的危险，但是“古巴人民宁愿牺牲生命也不愿丧失自由”。这时听众高呼，“到那时候，阿根廷的志愿军也宁愿去牺牲。”
    古巴总统的讲话得到听众们的欢呼。他们高呼古巴万岁、菲德尔·卡斯特罗万岁、“要古巴不要美国佬”、“阿根廷人，古巴就是（我们的）道路”等口号。多尔蒂科斯的演说结束后，群众在布宜诺斯艾利斯的中心街道举行了示威游行。
    古巴总统今天下午还在阿根廷议会受到众议院议长蒙哈丁和议员们的欢迎。他在简短的即席讲话中说，古巴现在第一次存在着充分的正义和满足着人民的权利要求。他强调指出了拉丁美洲各国人民支援古巴革命的重要意义。
