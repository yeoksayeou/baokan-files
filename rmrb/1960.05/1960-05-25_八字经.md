    “八字经”
    中共西安市碑林区委书记　柳尚礼
    提起我们的公社食堂，人人都称道八字经。哪八个字？好、多、简、靠、省、美、便、改。
    好：就是始终坚持积极办好自愿参加的原则；
    多：就是食堂形式多种多样，有街道食堂、院落食堂，也有干部职工和居民合办的食堂；
    简：就是因陋就简，不讲排场；
    靠：就是依靠劳动人民，食堂炊事管理人员必须由政治可靠，忠诚老实，热心为群众服务，没有传染病的劳动人民担任；
    省：就是不增加群众开支，不超吃粮食；
    美：就是美味可口，饭菜多样化，让大家吃得热，吃得香，吃得干净卫生；
    便：就是贯彻大集体、小自由的原则，使群众感到方便，可以吃多少买多少，星期天可以退伙，可以在食堂吃，也可以搞回去吃；
    改：就是不断改革灶具，逐步实现半机械化和机械化，不断改进饭菜质量，粗粮细作。
