　　Recently, Premier Zhou Enlai, carrying the profound friendship of the Chinese people towards the fraternal Vietnamese people, visited the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, where he received a warm welcome and cordial reception from the Vietnamese Party, government, and people. During the visit, Premier Zhou Enlai held cordial and friendly talks with Premier Pham Van Dong of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The Chinese Communist Party delegation, headed by Comrade Zhou Enlai, and the Vietnamese Labor Party delegation, headed by Comrade Ho Chi Minh, also held cordial and friendly talks. In the talks, the two sides exchanged views on major current international issues, further development of friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries, and issues of common concern to the two fraternal parties, reaching complete agreement on all issues discussed. The talks between the Party and government leaders of China and Vietnam not only further strengthened the unbreakable unity and friendship between the two countries and two parties but also made a significant contribution to the cause of peace in Asia and the world.

　　The talks between the Chinese and Vietnamese Premiers took place against the backdrop of the following international situation: the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is growing stronger and more united, the national democratic movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are in full swing, the struggles of people in various countries for peace, democracy, and social progress are advancing victoriously, and the struggles of the people of Japan, South Korea, and Turkey against traitorous regimes and imperialist control have gained greater momentum. Unwilling to accept defeat, U.S. imperialism recently discarded its temporary guise of "peace," revealed its aggressive nature, provoked the Soviet Union, provoked China, intensified its interference in and suppression of the revolutionary movements of various countries, supported the reactionary rule of Japan, South Korea, and Turkey, suppressed the patriotic and just struggles of the people, openly prepared for armed intervention in Cuba, supported the rebellion in Venezuela, and supported activities to subvert the government of Guinea, step by step escalating international tensions.

　　The governments of China and Vietnam have always pursued a peaceful foreign policy, and the people of China and Vietnam have always stood with the people of all countries striving for world peace, national independence, and social progress. The two Premiers believe that the signing of the Sino-Burmese Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Non-Aggression and the agreement on border issues, as well as the signing of the Sino-Nepalese Treaty of Peace and Friendship and the agreement on border issues, are significant victories for the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The two Premiers warmly welcomed the positive results achieved at the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference held in Conakry in April 1960 and believe that continuing to promote the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Spirit is of great significance to the cause of Asian-African solidarity and the maintenance of peace in Asia and the world. The two Premiers reiterated that the people of China and Vietnam firmly support the national democratic revolutionary movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America and firmly support the patriotic and just struggles of the people of South Korea, Japan, and Turkey against imperialism and its lackeys. The two Premiers strongly oppose the French colonialists' continued war of aggression against Algeria and express that the people of China and Vietnam firmly support the Cuban people's struggle against U.S. imperialist interference and for the consolidation of national independence and democratic freedom.

　　The two Premiers warmly welcome the Soviet Union's unremitting efforts to ease international tensions and hope that the summit conference of the heads of government of the East and West can achieve results conducive to peace. However, U.S. imperialism is blatantly creating tensions in an attempt to undermine the upcoming summit conference. The recent new provocations by U.S. imperialism against the Soviet Union once again expose that U.S. imperialism will not change its policy of hostility towards socialist countries. The two Premiers expressed the righteous indignation of the people of China and Vietnam towards the aggressive acts of U.S. imperialism, believing that this is not only an act of aggression against the Soviet Union but also a provocation against the entire socialist camp. The people of China and Vietnam firmly support the firm attitude adopted by the Soviet Union towards this act of aggression. The people of China and Vietnam and all peace-loving people in the world must heighten their vigilance and carry out unremitting struggles to strengthen opposition to all the conspiracies of the imperialist war-mongers. All of these fully express the desire of the people of China and Vietnam to safeguard peace and their strong will to oppose imperialism.

　　An important aspect of U.S. imperialism's intensified arms expansion and war preparations around the world is the continued sabotage of the Geneva Accords and the undermining of peace in Indochina. U.S. imperialism is brutally interfering in the internal affairs of Laos, obstructing the reunification of Vietnam, and attempting to turn South Vietnam into a U.S. military base and colony. Recently, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique in South Vietnam has intensified its collusion with U.S. imperialism, illegally increased the number of U.S. military advisors, and intensified its frenzied suppression of the people of South Vietnam. At the same time, U.S. imperialism and its lackeys are also putting pressure on and provoking Cambodia. The joint communiqué pointed out that the two Premiers believe that the situation in Laos can return to normal if the parties concerned are willing to resolve the existing problems through peaceful consultation. The two Premiers believe that the efforts of Prince Sihanouk and the Royal Government of Cambodia to safeguard independence and sovereignty and resolutely follow the path of peaceful neutrality are a significant contribution to the cause of peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia. The two Premiers also believe that the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference and the member states of the International Commission should take resolute and effective measures to stop the violations of the Geneva Accords by the United States and the South Vietnamese authorities and to ensure that the Geneva Accords on Vietnam are respected and fully implemented.

　　The Chinese people resolutely support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people for the peaceful reunification of their motherland and firmly believe that the Vietnamese people, under the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam headed by President Ho Chi Minh, will certainly be able to realize this wish of the entire Vietnamese people!

　　Imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries in various countries are trying to undermine the international communist movement and the unity of the socialist camp. The two Premiers unanimously expressed that the two countries will strive to strengthen the socialist camp and consolidate its unshakable unity on the basis of the 1957 Moscow Declaration of the Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries.

　　The solidarity between the fraternal parties of China and Vietnam and the solidarity between the people of China and Vietnam are important guarantees for the rapid development of socialist construction in our two countries and for the independence and prosperity of our two countries. In recent years, cooperation between our two countries in the political, economic, and cultural fields has been increasing. As pointed out in the joint communiqué of the two Premiers, the two countries will make every effort to further consolidate and develop this great friendship. The two Premiers also expressed their infinite confidence in the bright prospects of socialist construction in China and Vietnam. As Premier Zhou Enlai concludes his friendly visit to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, we wholeheartedly wish the cause of socialist construction in China and Vietnam a thousand miles a day! We wish the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the people of China and Vietnam will last forever!

### 加强中越友谊维护世界和平

    加强中越友谊维护世界和平
    最近几天，周恩来总理带着中国人民对兄弟的越南人民的深厚友情，访问了越南民主共和国，受到越南党、政府和人民的隆重欢迎和盛情接待。在访问期间，周恩来总理同越南民主共和国范文同总理举行了亲密友好的会谈，以周恩来同志为首的中国共产党代表团和以胡志明同志为首的越南劳动党代表团也进行了亲密友好的会谈。在会谈中，双方分别就目前各项重大的国际问题、进一步发展两国之间的友好合作关系问题，以及关系到两个兄弟党共同的问题交换了意见，对所讨论的一切问题都取得了完全一致的意见。中越两国党政领导人的会谈，不仅进一步加强了两国和两党之间的牢不可破的团结和友谊，而且是对亚洲和世界的和平事业的重大贡献。
    中越两国总理的会谈是在这样的国际局势下进行的：以苏联为首的社会主义阵营日益强大和团结一致，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族民主运动如火如荼，世界各国人民争取和平民主的斗争正胜利前进，日本、南朝鲜、土耳其人民反对卖国政权和帝国主义控制的斗争，有了更大的兴起。不甘心失败的美帝国主义，最近扔掉了它那一时伪装的“和平”姿态，露出侵略者的本色，向苏联挑衅，向中国挑衅，加紧干涉和镇压各国人民的革命运动，支持日本、南朝鲜、土耳其的反动统治，镇压人民的爱国正义斗争，公开准备对古巴进行武装干涉，支持委内瑞拉的叛乱，支持颠复几内亚政府的活动，步步加剧国际紧张局势。
    中越两国政府一向执行着和平外交政策，中越两国人民一向是同争取世界和平、民族独立和社会进步的各国人民站在一边的。两国总理认为中缅友好和互不侵犯条约和关于边界问题的协定的签订，以及中国—尼泊尔和平友好条约和关于边界问题的协定的签订，是和平共处五项原则的重大胜利。两国总理热烈欢迎1960年4月在科纳克里召开的亚非人民团结大会所取得的良好结果，并且相信，继续发扬和平共处五项原则和万隆精神，对亚非团结事业、维护亚洲和全世界和平具有重大的意义。两国总理重申中越两国人民坚决支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族民主革命运动，坚决支持南朝鲜、日本、土耳其人民反对帝国主义及其走狗的爱国正义斗争。两国总理强烈反对法国殖民主义者继续对阿尔及利亚进行的侵略战争，并且表示中越两国人民坚决支持古巴人民反对美帝国主义的干涉、巩固民族独立和民主自由的斗争。
    两国总理热烈欢迎苏联为了缓和国际紧张局势所进行的不懈努力；希望东西方大国政府首脑会议能取得有利于和平的结果。但是，美帝国主义却明目张胆地制造紧张局势，企图破坏即将召开的首脑会议。美帝国主义最近对于苏联的新挑衅，又一次暴露了美帝国主义是不会改变仇视社会主义国家的政策的。两国总理表达了中越两国人民对于美帝国主义侵略行为的义愤，认为这不仅是对苏联的一种侵略行为，而且是对整个社会主义阵营的一种挑衅；中越两国人民坚决支持苏联对这一侵略行为所采取的坚决态度，中越两国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民必须提高警惕，为加强反对帝国主义好战分子的一切阴谋而进行不懈的斗争。所有这些都充分表达了中越两国人民维护和平的愿望和反对帝国主义的坚强意志。
    美帝国主义在世界各地加紧扩军备战的一个重要方面，就是继续破坏日内瓦协议，破坏印度支那的和平。美帝国主义粗暴地干涉老挝的内政；阻止越南统一，并企图把南越变成美国的军事基地和殖民地。最近，南越吴庭艳集团同美帝国主义加紧勾结，非法增加美国军事顾问团人员，加紧对南越人民的疯狂镇压。同时，美帝国主义及其走狗也对柬埔寨施加压力和进行挑衅。联合公报指出，两国总理认为，如果有关方面愿意用和平协商办法解决现存的问题，老挝局势就可以恢复正常。两国总理认为，西哈努克亲王和柬埔寨王国政府维护独立和主权、坚决遵循和平中立的道路的努力，是对印度支那和东南亚和平事业的重大贡献。两国总理并且认为，日内瓦会议的两位主席和国际委员会各成员国应采取坚决和有效的措施，以阻止美国和南越当局违反日内瓦协议的行为，保证关于越南的日内瓦协议的得到尊重和充分履行。
    中国人民坚决支持越南人民争取祖国和平统一的正义斗争；并且深信，越南人民在以胡志明主席为首的越南劳动党和越南民主共和国政府的领导下，一定能够实现越南全体人民的这一愿望！
    帝国主义者、现代修正主义者和各国反动派正在力图破坏国际共产主义运动，破坏社会主义阵营的团结。两国总理一致表达了两国将在1957年社会主义国家共产党和工人党莫斯科会议宣言的基础上，为增强社会主义阵营的力量，和巩固其不可动摇的团结一致而努力奋斗。
    中越两国兄弟党之间的团结和中越两国人民之间的团结是我们两国社会主义建设的迅速发展和我们两国独立富强的重要的保证。近年来，我们两国之间，在政治、经济、文化各方面的合作，日益加强。正如两国总理联合公报所指出的，两国将尽一切努力进一步巩固和发展这种伟大的友谊。两国总理并对中越两国的社会主义建设的光明前景表示无限的信心。在周恩来总理结束了这次对越南民主共和国的友好访问的时刻，我们衷心地祝中越两国的社会主义建设事业一日千里！祝中越两国人民的永恒的牢不可破的友谊万古长青！
