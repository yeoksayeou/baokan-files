On the 28th, the second day of Premier Zhou Enlai's arrival in Ulaanbaatar, he began to visit and tour this thriving red hero city. During the tour of the city and the visit to the two newly built factories of the Industrial Complex—the shoe factory and the wool textile factory—the splendid achievements made by the industrious and simple Mongolian people in socialist construction left a deep impression on the distinguished Chinese guests. And the Ulaanbaatar people's lofty friendship with the Chinese people is even more unforgettable for the Chinese guests.

In the morning, Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi, accompanied by Chairman Tsedenbal, ascended a small hill in the northwest corner of the suburbs, overlooking the entire city. The city's scenery was clearly visible. Ulaanbaatar Mayor Bata introduced the city's past, present, and future development prospects to Premier Zhou Enlai. This city has experienced rapid development in the last five years, with new factories constantly increasing, the working class growing, and the people's cultural and welfare facilities increasing year by year. The development plan formulated six or seven years ago has already been completed ahead of schedule. The vigorous development of Ulaanbaatar is a microcosm of the flourishing People's Republic of Mongolia. Premier Zhou enthusiastically viewed the city's construction plan while looking at the city's buildings. Premier Zhou said to Chief Engineer Chimed: "You have done a very good job!"

When Premier Zhou Enlai took a car along the newly built ring road, touring the city's appearance, a group of Ulaanbaatar citizens gathered on both sides of the road, warmly welcoming Premier Zhou Enlai and expressing their respect for the distinguished Chinese guests.

In the afternoon, Premier Zhou and Vice Premier Chen, again accompanied by Chairman Tsedenbal, visited the two newly built factories of the Industrial Complex—the shoe factory and the wool textile factory.

Amid cheers, Premier Zhou Enlai first visited the shoe factory. This is a factory with modern machinery and equipment, where male and female workers are skillfully operating the machines. This factory was originally scheduled to produce 1,200 pairs of leather shoes and boots per day, but now the daily production has reached a maximum of 1,900 pairs. During the visit, Premier Zhou had cordial conversations with the workers, praising their production achievements and encouraging them to continue their efforts to achieve greater success. The visit of Premier Zhou Enlai and Chairman Tsedenbal to this factory gave the workers great encouragement. Gonsmaa, the leader of a production team in the shoe factory that is striving to become a "Socialist Labor Team," said to us with enthusiasm: "The visit of the envoy of the Chinese people, State Council Premier Zhou Enlai, to our factory is an honor for all the workers in our factory." She said that the production team she leads had launched a seven-day production competition to welcome Premier Zhou Enlai, during which everyone exceeded their daily production targets with achievements of 120% to 145%. Young female worker Gama told us that they must respond to Premier Zhou Enlai's concern with better production results.

The vast number of employees in the wool textile factory had launched a production competition to welcome Premier Zhou Enlai. Today, Padarch, the director of the spinning workshop who won the socialist mobile red flag in the competition, presented the winning red flag to Premier Zhou Enlai.

Premier Zhou and Vice Premier Chen went from one workshop to another, seeing snow-white sheep wool gradually spun into yarn, woven into sweaters and blankets, and dyed into bright colors after several processes. Premier Zhou pointed to the spacious and bright workshop and the brand-new machines and said repeatedly: "Catching up from behind!" Vice Premier Chen Yi also said to Chairman Tsedenbal: "Your factory is much more beautiful and better equipped than the Shanghai Wool Textile Factory in China. The Shanghai Wool Textile Factory has old machines. You are catching up from behind!" Chairman Tsedenbal laughed heartily.

In the finished product workshop, Premier Zhou and Vice Premier Chen visited various high-quality wool fabrics such as wool gabardine, tweed, worsted, and large floral blankets that had already been woven, and praised the achievements made by this factory. Premier Zhou said to Chairman Tsedenbal that the quality of your finished products is very high and can be exhibited. Guangzhou, China, holds two export commodity fairs every year, and you are welcome to take samples from this factory to exhibit. These products can be exported.

During the visit, the director of the wool textile factory, on behalf of all the employees, thanked the Chinese people for their fraternal assistance and thanked the Chinese experts and technicians for their help. Premier Zhou said that our assistance is not enough. If Chinese technicians have any shortcomings, we hope you will criticize them without any reservations.

After the visit, Premier Zhou walked out of the factory building and came to the spacious courtyard to say goodbye to the workers who were welcoming him on both sides of the road. At this time, the factory director said that in order to welcome Premier Zhou, in addition to launching a production competition, the workers also beautified the factory area in their spare time. He pointed to the newly laid lawn, the newly planted green trees, and the newly built rockery and said to Premier Zhou that these are the labor achievements of the workers and also a manifestation of the workers' lofty friendship with the Chinese people. Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Chen Yi, and Chairman Tsedenbal took a group photo in front of the rockery for remembrance. This is a commemoration of friendship and a permanent commemoration!

    崇高的友谊
    新华社记者　彭逢烨　于民生
  　28日，周恩来总理到达乌兰巴托的第二天，开始访问参观这个正在繁荣发展着的红色英雄城市。在游览市区，和参观工业联合工厂新建的两个厂——皮鞋厂和毛纺织厂的过程中，勤劳纯朴的蒙古人民在社会主义建设事业中所取得的辉煌成就给中国贵宾留下了深刻的印象。而乌兰巴托人民对中国人民的崇高友谊更使中国客人永远难忘。
    上午，周恩来总理、陈毅副总理由泽登巴尔主席陪同，登上了市郊西北角上的一个小山头，俯瞰全城，全市景物历历在目。乌兰巴托市市长巴塔，向周恩来总理介绍了这个城市的过去、现在和将来发展的远景。这个城市，在最近五年来有了飞快的发展，新的工厂不断增加，工人阶级正在成长，人民的文化、福利设施也在逐年增多，六、七年前拟定的发展规划，早已提前完成。乌兰巴托蓬勃发展的情景正是蒙古人民共和国欣欣向荣的一幅缩影。周总理一面兴致勃勃地观看城市建设规划图，一面了望城市建筑。周总理向总工程师奇米德说：“你们的工作作得很好！”
    当周恩来总理乘车沿着新修的环行马路，绕城参观市容时，一群乌兰巴托市的市民们，聚集在马路两边，热烈欢迎周总理，表达他们对中国贵宾的敬意。
    下午，周总理和陈副总理又由泽登巴尔主席陪同，参观了工业联合工厂新建的两个厂——皮鞋厂和毛纺织厂。
    周恩来总理在欢呼声中先来到皮鞋厂参观。这是一个有着现代化机器设备的工厂，男、女职工正在熟练地操纵着机器。这个工厂原定每天生产一千二百双皮鞋和皮靴，但现在每天的生产量最高已达到一千九百双。在参观过程中，周总理同工人们亲切地交谈，称赞工人们的生产成绩，勉励他们再接再厉取得更大的成就。周恩来总理和泽登巴尔主席来到这个工厂参观，给了职工们以很大的鼓舞。皮鞋厂的一个正在争取成为“社会主义劳动队”光荣称号的生产队队长贡斯玛热情洋溢地对我们说：“中国人民的使者、国务院总理周恩来同志来我厂访问，是我们全厂工人的荣誉。”她说，她领导的生产队，为了迎接周总理，曾经开展了七天的生产竞赛，在此期间，每个人都以120％到145％的成绩超额完成了每天的生产指标。青年女工嘎玛对我们说，他们一定要以更好的生产成绩来回答周恩来总理的关怀。
    毛纺厂广大职工们曾经开展生产竞赛来迎接周总理。今天，在竞赛中获得社会主义流动红旗的纺纱车间的主任帕达尔奇把他们获得的优胜红旗赠送给周总理。
    周总理和陈副总理从一个车间来到另一个车间，看到雪白的绵羊毛，经过几个工序逐渐纺成毛线，织成毛衣、毛毯，又染上了鲜丽的颜色。周总理指着宽大明亮的车间和崭新的机器连声说：“后来居上！”陈毅副总理也向泽登巴尔主席说：“你们这个工厂比中国上海的毛纺厂漂亮得多，设备也新，上海毛纺厂的是老机器，你们后来居上！”泽登巴尔主席畅笑起来。
    周总理和陈毅副总理在成品车间里，参观了已经织成的毛哔叽、花呢、华达呢和大花毛毯等各种质量优良的毛织品，不绝口地称赞这个工厂所取得的成就。周总理对泽登巴尔主席说，你们生产的成品质量很高，可以展览一下。中国广州每年要举行两次出口商品展览会，欢迎你们把这个厂的样品拿去展览，这些产品可以出口。
    在参观的过程中，毛纺织厂厂长代表全体职工，感谢中国人民兄弟般的援助，感谢中国专家和技术人员的帮助。周总理说，我们的帮助还不够，中国技术人员如有缺点，希望你们提出批评，不要客气。
    参观结束以后，周总理走出厂房，来到宽敞的院落里向夹道欢送的职工告别。这时工厂厂长说，职工们为欢迎周总理，除了开展生产竞赛以外，还利用业余时间美化了厂区。他指着那新铺的草地，新植的绿树和新筑的假山对周总理说，这些都是工人们的劳动成就，也是职工们对中国人民崇高友谊的表现。周恩来总理、陈毅副总理请泽登巴尔主席等一块在假山前留影纪念。这是友谊的纪念，也是永久的纪念！
