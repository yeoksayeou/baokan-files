Comrades! Friends!
The American robber clique has torn off its mask of peace and completely exposed its aggressive face.

U.S. imperialism is the number one enemy of the Chinese people and the number one enemy of the people of the world. It establishes military bases all over the world, supports reactionary regimes, oppresses the people of all countries, acts recklessly everywhere, and carries out war provocations.

Now, on the eve of the Four-Power Summit, Eisenhower has dispatched spy planes to invade Soviet airspace. After being caught red-handed, he still stubbornly insists on his war policy and refuses to take responsibility for his crimes. Everyone understands that the US government is the culprit for war threats and the destruction of world peace. Eisenhower must bear full responsibility for undermining the Four-Power Summit and continuing to create tension.

Just as Chairman Mao said: The days of imperialism are numbered. They have done all kinds of bad things, and the oppressed people of the whole world will never forgive them.

On behalf of the members of all democratic parties, I solemnly declare: We firmly support the just stand of the Soviet government and strongly condemn the aggressive crimes of US imperialism.

The American robber clique's invasion of the Soviet Union is an invasion of China, an invasion of the entire socialist camp, and an invasion of the people of the whole world.

The Chinese people will always stand with the great Soviet people and resolutely fight to the end against the aggression of US imperialism and to defend world peace.

Let us shout:
Unite, people of the world!
Resolutely support the just stand of the Soviet Union!
Down with US imperialism!
Oppose aggression, defend peace!

    美国强盗侵犯苏联就是侵犯中国
    中国国民党革命委员会、中国民主同盟中国民主建国会、中国民主促进会、中国农工民主党中国致公党、九三学社、台湾民主自治同盟代表黄炎培的讲话同志们！朋友们！
    美国强盗集团，已经撕破和平假面具，彻底暴露出侵略面目来了。
    美帝国主义是中国人民的头号敌人，是世界人民的头号敌人，它在全世界建立军事基地，扶植反动政权，欺压各国人民，到处横行霸道，进行战争挑衅。
    现在艾森豪威尔竟在四国首脑会议召开前夕，派遣间谍飞机，侵犯苏联领空。在人赃俱获之后，他仍然蛮横地坚持战争政策，拒绝承担罪责。大家都明白，美国政府是进行战争威胁，破坏世界和平的罪魁。对于破坏四国首脑会议，继续制造紧张局势，艾森豪威尔要负完全责任。
    正像毛主席所说：帝国主义的寿命不会很长了，他们做尽了坏事，全世界一切受压迫的人民决不会饶恕他们。
    我代表各民主党派成员郑重声明：我们坚决拥护苏联政府的严正立场，严厉谴责美帝国主义的侵略罪行。
    美国强盗集团对苏联的侵犯，就是对中国的侵犯，对整个社会主义阵营的侵犯，也是对全世界人民的侵犯。
    中国人民永远和伟大的苏联人民站在一起，为反对美帝国主义侵略，保卫世界和平，坚决斗争到底。
    让我们高呼：
    全世界人民团结起来！
    坚决支持苏联严正立场！
    打倒美帝国主义！
    反对侵略，保卫和平！
