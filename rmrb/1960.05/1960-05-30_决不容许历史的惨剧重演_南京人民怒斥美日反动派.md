Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, May 26th: The farce of the Kishida Nobusuke group in Japan forcibly "passing" the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" has aroused even greater anger among the people of Nanjing. On the 24th, the Xiaguan District, Qinhuai District, Pukou District, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, suburban communes, and representatives of the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers held rallies respectively, denouncing the heinous crimes of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries and resolutely supporting the patriotic and just struggle of the Japanese people.

More than 400 workers and residents of Xiaguan District and family members of workers at the Xiaguan Power Plant held a rally in front of the "Monument to Dead Workers" at the Xiaguan Power Plant. The workers of the Xiaguan Power Plant and nearby residents will never forget that twenty-three years ago, Japanese invaders used dozens of machine guns to massacre more than 50,000 Chinese people near the power plant from morning to afternoon. Forty-five old workers of the power plant were killed in this massacre. Today, the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries are colluding again to revive Japanese militarism and launch new wars. How can people suppress the anger in their hearts? Everyone expressed their indignation and stated that they would never allow the historical tragedy to be repeated.

At a rally of more than 300 residents' representatives on the banks of the Qinhuai River, everyone unanimously expressed their firm support for the struggle of the Japanese people and vowed to carry the struggle through to the end together. Chen Guishuang, a 59-year-old resident, said with tears in her eyes at the meeting: "During the Nanjing Massacre in 1937, five members of my family were brutally murdered by the Japanese devils. This blood feud is unforgettable. Now U.S. imperialism wants to arm Japan and revive Japanese militarism. We resolutely disagree and resolutely support the just struggle of the Japanese people."

On the same day, at a workers' rally held by the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, many workers said that the Chinese people, who have been fighting imperialism for more than a hundred years, deeply realize that there is no other way to deal with imperialists except through struggle. Zhou Guoqin, an advanced producer in the city and a worker at the Nanjing Machine Tool Plant, said: "Playing two-faced tricks is an old trick of imperialism. While chanting peace, they are engaged in arms expansion and war preparations. We must expose the conspiracy of imperialism's fake peace and real war preparations at all times, heighten our vigilance, and give the aggressors who dare to launch a war a devastating blow at any time."

People in the suburbs also held a rally on this day to support the Japanese people's opposition to the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.

    决不容许历史的惨剧重演
    南京人民怒斥美日反动派
    据新华社南京26日电　日本岸信介集团非法强行“通过”美日“安全条约”的丑剧激起了南京市人民更大的愤怒。24日，下关区、秦淮区、浦口区、市工会、郊区公社以及市烈属军属代表，分别举行了集会，控诉了美日反动派的滔天罪行，坚决支持日本人民的爱国正义斗争。
    下关区职工、居民、下关电厂的职工家属四百多人在下关电厂“死难工人纪念碑”前举行了集会。下关电厂的工人和附近居民永远也不会忘记二十三年前，日本侵略者在电厂附近用几十挺机枪从上午打到下午，惨杀五万多名中国人民的滔天罪行，电厂的四十五位老工人就是在这次被杀的。今天美日反动派又要勾结起来，复活日本军国主义，发动新战争，人们怎能抑制心头的愤怒。大家激愤地表示决不容许历史的惨剧重演。
    秦淮河畔三百多居民代表的集会，也一致表示坚决支持日本人民的斗争，共同把斗争进行到底。五十九岁的居民陈桂霜泣不成声地在会上说：1937年日本鬼子在南京大屠杀时，我一家有五口被惨杀了。这血海深仇叫人刻骨难忘。现在美帝国主义要武装日本，复活日本军国主义，我们坚决不答应，我们坚决支持日本人民的正义斗争。
    同一天，在市工会召开的工人集会上，许多工人说，与帝国主义斗争了一百多年的中国人民，深切地体验到，对付帝国主义者除了斗争没有别的办法。市先进生产者、南京机床厂工人周国琴说：“耍两面手法是帝国主义的老手法，一边嘴上喊和平，一边却在进行扩军备战，我们要随时揭穿帝国主义的假和平真备战的阴谋，提高警惕，随时给胆敢发动战争的侵略者以毁灭性的打击。”
    郊区人民也在这一天举行了支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的大会。
