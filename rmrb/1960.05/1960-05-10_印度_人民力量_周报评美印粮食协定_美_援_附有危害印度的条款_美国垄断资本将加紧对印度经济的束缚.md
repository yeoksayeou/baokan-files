Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 7th: The Indian Tamil newspaper "People's Power" Weekly published an editorial on the 6th, pointing out that the food agreement concluded between India and the United States will "intensify the shackles of US monopoly capitalists on the Indian economy," and exposing the clauses attached to this US "aid" that are harmful to India.

The newspaper said, "The pro-American faction in India says that never before has such a large amount of aid been given to any Asian country. They specifically mention the provision of 2.56 billion rupees from the proceeds of selling surplus agricultural products in India for development purposes. However, they forget that this amount is not unconditionally and directly handed over to the Indian government. They forget that it is precisely by relying on this provision that US monopoly capitalists have managed to gain a say on such an important issue as determining the basis of India's development plans. America's interest in developing its private sector partners in India has become notorious and obvious." The newspaper revealed that in the part of the agreement that has already been disclosed, there is another very harmful clause. This clause stipulates that the Indian government will hand over 950 million rupees to US agencies in India as their operating expenses. Such a large sum of Indian currency handed over to the US Embassy will enable the Embassy to interfere in India's political life. The newspaper revealed the role that US money played in the Kerala state elections not long ago. The newspaper said that US money, in the name of donations to churches, flowed into Kerala in order to suppress democratic forces. After the conclusion of the food agreement, the Americans do not need to find convenient excuses. It can now be said that since anti-communism is one of the recognized programs of American policy, the Indian currency in its hands will be used for this purpose.

    印度“人民力量”周报评美印粮食协定
    美“援”附有危害印度的条款
    美国垄断资本将加紧对印度经济的束缚
    新华社新德里7日电　印度泰米尔文报纸“人民力量”周报6日发表社论，指出印度同美国缔结的粮食协定将“加紧美国垄断资本家对印度经济的束缚”，并且揭露这笔美国“援助”所附带的危害印度的条款。
    这家报纸说，“印度的亲美派说，过去从来没有把这样大量的援助给过任何亚洲国家。他们特别提出把在印度出售剩余农产品的款项中的二十五亿六千万卢比作为开发之用的规定。但是，他们忘记了，这个数目并不是无条件地直接交给印度政府的。他们忘记了，正是依靠这个规定，美国垄断资本家设法获得了决定印度发展计划的基础这样一个重大问题上的发言权。美国对发展它在印度的合作者的私营部分的兴趣，已经臭名远扬，昭然若揭了。”这家报纸揭露，在已经透露的那部分协议中，还有另一项非常有害的条款。这一条款规定，印度政府把九亿五千万卢比交给美国在印度的代理机构作为他们的工作经费。这么一大笔印度货币交给美国大使馆，将使大使馆干涉印度的政治生活。报纸揭露了不久以前美国金钱在喀拉拉邦选举中所起的作用。报纸说，美国金钱以对教会的捐款为名，流入喀拉拉邦以便压制民主力量。在缔结粮食协定后，美国人不需要找方便的借口了。它现在可以说，由于反共是美国政策的公认的纲领之一，它手中的印度货币将用于这个目的。
