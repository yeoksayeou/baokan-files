　　Work Hard and Rest Well
　　Properly arranging students' study, labor, and rest is an important issue in improving teaching quality and carrying out educational revolution.
　　Since the Great Leap Forward, the enthusiasm of teachers and students has greatly increased, teaching work has been greatly improved, the preparatory work for teaching reform has been carried out very well, and everyone wants to realize the Party's educational policy with the greatest effort and the highest speed. To achieve this goal, we should start from a comprehensive perspective and focus on the long term. In order for students to better accept classroom teaching and absorb the new knowledge that is increasing every day; in order for teachers to better teach and truly teach students well, we should pay attention to properly arranging the time for teachers and students to study, work, and rest, so as to achieve a balance between work and rest. Labor and rest are a unity of opposites. There should be both labor and rest, both study and work, and also rest. Especially for young people who are growing up, sufficient rest and sleep are necessary to better complete their learning tasks and provide conditions for all-round development. If study and work are tasks, then rest is also a task. People engaged in education and leading cadres should pay attention to this issue and better solve this problem. The method is to pay attention to the overall arrangement of time, improve teaching methods, and care for students' lives. Tianjin No. 16 Middle School has noticed this problem, which is good. Only in this way can we ensure the continuous leap forward of school work.

    有劳有逸  
    妥善安排学生的学习，劳动和休息，是提高教学质量、进行教育革命的一个重要问题。
    大跃进以来，师生的积极性大为提高，教学工作有了很大的改进，教学改革的准备工作进行得很好，人人都想以最大的干劲、最高的速度来实现党的教育方针。为了达到这个目的，应该从全面出发，从长远着眼。为了学生更好的接受课堂教学，吸收每天增加的新的知识；为了教师更好的教课，真正教好学生，就应注意妥善安排师生的学习、劳动和休息的时间，做到有劳有逸。劳逸是矛盾的统一，有劳有逸，有学习和工作，也应该有休息。特别是正在成长的青年少年，有足够的休息和睡眠，才能更好的完成学习任务，为全面发展提供条件。如果说学习和工作是任务，那么休息也是任务。作教育工作的人和领导干部都应该关心这个问题，更好的解决这个问题。其办法是注意全面安排时间，改进教学方法，关心学生的生活。天津十六中学注意到了这个问题，这是好的。只有这样，才能保证学校工作的持续跃进。
