Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 26th: The Japanese Socialist Party today issued a statement declaring the 50-day extension of the Diet session "resolution" unilaterally "passed" by the Nobusuke Kishi group in the Senate invalid.

The statement said that demanding Nobusuke Kishi's resignation and the dissolution of the Diet has become the common desire of all Japanese citizens. We will fight together with the masses to the final victory based on the interpretation that the extension of the Diet session is invalid and the new "Security Treaty" violates the Constitution.

The Socialist Party expressed strong protest to the Liberal Democratic Party's Nobusuke Kishi group in the statement and stated that it would investigate the responsibility of the Senate.

This afternoon, the Independents Club also issued a statement saying that it was deeply regrettable that the Nobusuke Kishi group forcibly convened the Senate "plenary session."

In addition, the "Liaison Council for the Defense of Democracy and Peace," composed of nine organizations including the Japanese Democratic Socialist Party and the All-Japan Trade Union Congress, issued a statement today saying that the Nobusuke Kishi group's unilateral vote on the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is a fascist act that undermines parliamentary politics. We protest to the government with extreme anger. In order to safeguard peace and democracy, only the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet's resignation en masse and the dissolution of the Diet will suffice.

    日本社会党发表声明
    宣布参议院非法决议无效
    据新华社26日讯　东京消息：日本社会党今天发表声明，宣布岸信介集团在参议院片面“通过”的延长国会会期五十天的“决议”无效。
    声明说，要求岸信介下台和解散国会，已经成为全体日本国民共同的愿望。我们将根据国会延长会期无效和新“安全条约”违反宪法的这种解释，同群众一起斗争到最后胜利。
    社会党在声明中向自由民主党岸信介集团表示强烈抗议，并且表示要追究参议院的责任。
    今天下午，无党派俱乐部也发表声明说，岸信介集团强行召开参议院“全体会议”，令人感到非常遗憾。
    另外，由日本民主社会党、全日本工会会议等九个组织组成的“维护民主与和平联络会议”今天发表声明说，岸信介集团单方面表决新日美“安全条约”，是破坏议会政治的法西斯行动。我们以极大的愤怒向政府提出抗议。为了维护和平和民主，只有岸信介内阁总辞职和解散国会。
