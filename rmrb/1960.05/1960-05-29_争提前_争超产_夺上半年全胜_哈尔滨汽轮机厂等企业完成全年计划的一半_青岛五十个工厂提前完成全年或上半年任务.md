Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 28th: The Harbin Turbine Plant realized the Party's call to strive to complete half of the year's plan in the first half of the year ahead of schedule in the first half of May. The output is close to the total of last year.

The main reason why the Harbin Turbine Plant was able to complete half of the year's production plan ahead of schedule is that the plant's Party committee carefully analyzed the new situation of the sustained leap forward in socialist construction, strived for high speed in production, and organized workers to carry out a vigorous technical innovation and technical revolution movement. The movement focused on breaking through the various weak links in production and promoted a comprehensive leap forward in production. For example, this year, due to a large increase in the manufacturing tasks of large-scale power generation equipment compared to last year, the machining and final assembly capabilities of the main engine workshop could not meet the needs of production. In response to this key problem, the factory's Party committee organized workers in this workshop to vigorously innovate cutting tools, increasing cutting efficiency by two to thirty-two times.

The factory's Party committee, starting from the fourth quarter of last year, adopted the method of "grasping with both hands," both grasping the early completion of the production plan and grasping the preparation of raw materials, ensuring the high-speed leap forward in production.

Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, 28th: Fifty factories in Qingdao have completed this year's full-year or first-half national plans ahead of schedule. Among them, the Shimen Products Factory, the Third Wood Products Factory of the Handicraft Industry Bureau, and the Second Instrument Factory are four units that have completed the annual plan ahead of schedule; the Jilu Needle Factory, the Model Factory, the Nanhua Hardware Factory, the Fifth Machinery Factory of the Handicraft Industry Bureau, and the First Wood Products Factory are forty-six units that have completed the first-half plan ahead of schedule.

The Shimen Products Factory comprehensively overfulfilled the annual national plan on the 23rd, with an average daily output value nearly twice that of last year. The factory's employees, under the conditions of insufficient raw material supply, vigorously promoted cooperation, vigorously promoted comprehensive utilization and the use of substitutes, and adopted methods such as improving formulas, which effectively promoted the leap forward in production. The First Wood Products Factory of the Handicraft Industry Bureau successively grasped the key to production, making woodworking machines into three "dragons," allowing many employees to put down heavy axes, planes, and hammers, and using machines in production. Therefore, the entire factory overfulfilled the first-half national plan by 12.43% on May 17th.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 26th: The Taiyuan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant, which once attended the National Conference of Heroes, completed the first-half national production plan sixty-seven days ahead of schedule. As of May 15th, the entire factory had completed 64.96% of this year's total output value.

Since the beginning of this year, the factory's production has maintained a continuous leap forward situation with over-fulfillment every ten days and a monthly increase. From January to May, the entire factory completed the national production plan fifteen to sixteen days ahead of schedule each month, and the output value of each month increased compared to the previous month. This year, fourteen technical and economic indicators have reached or exceeded the advanced levels of the country and the province.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 27th: The Shenyang Transformer Factory has overfulfilled the first-half national production plan forty-one days ahead of schedule. As of May 20th, various major products produced by the factory have overfulfilled the first-half national plan, including transformers completed 102.1%, current transformers completed 108.2%, and switchgear completed 100%; the total output value of the entire factory has also completed 101% of the first-half national plan. Compared with the same period in 1959, the total output value increased by 29%, transformers increased by 17.7%, switchgear increased by 77.6%, and current transformers increased by 7.1%. In addition, thirteen major new products have been successfully trial-produced.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 28th: The employees of the Harbin Electric Carbon Factory completed half of this year's national plan ahead of schedule by fourteen days with an overfulfillment of 5.2%.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 28th: The employees of the Universe Porcelain Factory in Jingdezhen City, Jiangxi Province, have completed more than half of the national annual plan in less than five months. As of May 25th, the actual output value completed by the entire factory accounted for 52.3% of the national annual plan, and the output accounted for 69.5%.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 28th: As of May 26th, the Tianjin Chemical Reagent General Factory overfulfilled the first-half national production plan by 20.24%. The total output value increased by 175.54% compared with the same period last year, labor productivity increased by 259%, product output increased by 41%, comparable product costs decreased by 1.92%, and the qualified rate reached 100%.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 28th: As of May 26th, the Chongqing Auto Parts Factory had completed the national plan for the first half of this year ahead of schedule. Among them, the total industrial output value completed 114% of the plan, an increase of 199% compared with the same period last year; labor productivity completed 113% of the plan, an increase of 194% compared with the same period last year; and the product quality was all qualified.

    争提前　争超产　夺上半年全胜                                  
    哈尔滨汽轮机厂等企业完成全年计划的一半
    青岛五十个工厂提前完成全年或上半年任务
    本报哈尔滨28日电　哈尔滨汽轮机厂在5月上半月提前实现了党提出的力争上半年完成全年计划一半的号召。产量接近去年全年的总和。
    哈尔滨汽轮机厂所以能提前完成全年生产计划的一半，主要是因为这个厂的党委认真分析了社会主义建设持续跃进的新形势，在生产中力争高速度，同时组织职工开展了轰轰烈烈的技术革新和技术革命运动。运动中着重突破生产中的各个薄弱环节，推动了生产全面跃进。例如，今年由于大型发电设备制造任务比去年大大增加，主机车间的加工和总装配能力不能适应生产需要。针对这一关键问题，工厂党委组织这个车间的工人大闹刀具革新，使刀具切削效率提高二倍到三十二倍。
    这个厂的党委从去年第四季度开始，就采取“两手抓”的办法，既抓提前完成生产计划，又抓原材料准备工作，保证了生产的高速度跃进。
    据新华社青岛28日电　青岛市已有五十个工厂提前完成了今年全年或上半年的国家计划。其中，提前完成全年计划的有石棉制品厂，手工业管理局第三木器厂，第二仪表厂等四个单位；提前完成上半年计划的有冀鲁制针厂，模型厂，南华小五金厂、手工业管理局第五机械厂和第一木器厂等四十六个单位。
    石棉制品厂在23日就全面超额完成了全年国家计划，平均日产值比去年提高近两倍。这个厂的职工们在原料供应不足的情况下，大搞协作，大搞综合利用和采用代用品，并采取改进配方等方法，有力地促进了生产跃进。手工业管理局第一木器厂先后抓住生产关键，使木工机具配成三条“龙”，使许多职工放下了笨重的斧头、推刨、锤子，在生产上用上了机器。因此全厂在5月17日就超额12.43％完成了上半年国家计划。
    据新华社太原26日电　曾经出席全国群英会的太原机车车辆厂，提前六十七天完成了上半年国家生产计划。截至5月15日，全厂已经完成了今年全年总产值的64.96％。
    今年以来，这个厂的生产一直保持着旬旬超额、月高一月的不断跃进的局面。1月到5月份，全厂每月都提前十五天到十六天完成国家生产计划，每月的产值都比上月提高，今年已有十四项技术经济指标达到或超过了全国、全省的先进水平。
    据新华社沈阳27日电　沈阳变压器厂已经提前四十一天超额完成上半年国家生产计划。到5月20日止，这个厂生产的各种主要产品都已超额完成了上半年国家计划，其中，变压器完成102.1％，互感器完成108.2％，开关柜完成百分之百；全厂生产总值也已完成上半年国家计划101％。与1959年同期比较，总产值增长29％，变压器增长17.7％，开关柜增长77.6％，互感器增长7.1％。此外，还试制成功了十三种重大新产品。
    据新华社哈尔滨28日电　哈尔滨电碳厂职工，提前十四天超额5.2％完成了今年国家计划的一半。
    据新华社南昌28日电　江西景德镇市宇宙瓷厂职工在不到五个月的时间内，已经完成国家全年计划的一半以上。到5月25日，全厂实际完成产值已占国家全年计划的52.3％，产量占69.5％。
    据新华社天津28日电　天津化学试剂总厂到5月26日止，超额20.24％完成上半年国家生产计划。总产值比去年同期增长175.54％，劳动生产率提高259％，产品产量增长41％，可比产品成本降低1.92％，正品率达到100％。
    据新华社重庆28日电　重庆汽车配件厂到5月26日止，已经提前完成了今年上半年的国家计划。其中，工业总产值完成计划114％，比去年同期增长199％；劳动生产率完成计划113％，比去年同期提高194％；产品质量全部合格。（附图片）
