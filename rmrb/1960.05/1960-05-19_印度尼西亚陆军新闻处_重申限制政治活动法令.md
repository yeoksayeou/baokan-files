Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta. Lieutenant Colonel Sunarjo, Director of the Indonesian Army News Service, reiterated today that the decree issued by the Central War Authority of the Indonesian Army on July 23, 1959, is still valid. On that day, the Central War Authority of the Army announced the revocation of the decree issued on June 3, 1959, which prohibited political party activities, and simultaneously issued a decree restricting the holding of politically-natured assemblies and parades. Sunarjo also said that newspapers are prohibited from independently interpreting this decree.

Since the implementation of the decree of July 23 last year, many Indonesian political parties and groups must obtain the consent of the Army authorities to hold assemblies, and speeches and resolutions at the meetings can only be published after inspection.

    重申限制政治活动法令
    据新华社雅加达电　印度尼西亚陆军新闻处处长苏纳约中校今天重申，印度尼西亚陆军中央战时掌权者在1959年7月23日发布的法令现在仍然有效。陆军中央战时掌权者曾经在这一天宣布撤消在1959年6月3日发布的禁止政党活动的法令，同时发布了限制举行具有政治性质的集会和游行的法令。苏纳约又说，禁止报纸对这项法令自行作出解释。
    自从实施去年7月23日的法令以来，印度尼西亚许多政党和团体必须获得陆军当局的同意才能举行集会，会上的讲话和决议只有经过检查后才能公布。
