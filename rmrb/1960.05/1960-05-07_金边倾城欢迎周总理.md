    Phnom Penh Welcomes Premier Zhou with Open Arms
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter: Yu Minsheng, Zhang Yao
    The weather in Phnom Penh is astonishingly hot: the indoor thermometer has already risen to 37 degrees Celsius, and the sun is melting the asphalt on the roads. However, the Cambodian people's friendly feelings towards the Chinese people are even hotter than the weather. On the day Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Chen Yi, and their entourage arrived in Phnom Penh, we saw a jubilant sea of people, a forest of colorful flags, and we heard continuous cheers of friendship and thunderous applause. It is no exaggeration to say that Phnom Penh turned out en masse to welcome Premier Zhou.
    Even before Premier Zhou arrived, the Cambodian Royal Radio broadcast an appeal to the people to enthusiastically welcome Premier Zhou Enlai, "in order to express our joy and welcome to this great friend." The radio said: "This will show that our Cambodian nation and people are cultured, know how to cherish friendship, and know how to welcome our country's distinguished guests with noble ceremonies."
    Cambodia's leaders and people truly cherish Sino-Cambodian friendship. When the distinguished Chinese guests arrived, Prince Sihanouk, Prime Minister Pho Proeung, members of both houses of parliament, and all senior government officials warmly greeted them at the airport. Prince Sihanouk was so excited and moved, he held the hands of Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi for a long time, engaging in pleasant small talk. In that instant, one could not help but recall the historically significant Bandung Conference. Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Chen, and Prince Sihanouk first met at that conference. Since that conference, Prince Sihanouk has visited China twice, and Premier Zhou Enlai is now visiting Cambodia for the second time. Economic cooperation and cultural exchanges between China and Cambodia have strengthened and expanded, the volume of trade has gradually increased, and mutual visits by various delegations have become increasingly frequent. For thousands of years, the people of China and Cambodia have been friendly, but never as close as they are today.
    There were too many touching scenes at the airport, but one that must be mentioned is the welcoming contingent at the airport, among which the welcoming teams from various departments of the Royal Government were particularly conspicuous. They held horizontal banners with the names of their respective departments written in Chinese, arranged in order. When Premier Zhou passed by, they burst into enthusiastic and unrestrained cheers, many shouting in Chinese: "Long live Sino-Cambodian friendship!" We met an elderly gentleman with some gray hair who worked in the planning department. When talking about welcoming Premier Zhou, he said with great excitement: "Each of us sincerely and warmly welcomes the Chinese Premier because China is our most reliable neighbor. China's assistance has indeed brought benefits to us Cambodians."
    The most moving scene was the grand occasion of hundreds of thousands of people lining the ten-kilometer road from the airport to the Royal Palace to welcome the distinguished guests. Everyone was dressed in their newest or most brightly colored clothes, and almost everyone held a Chinese or Cambodian national flag. As Premier Zhou and Prince Sihanouk passed by in an open car, people waved flags, straw hats, and handkerchiefs, clapping and chanting slogans to their hearts' content. After the car entered the city, the number of welcoming crowds increased, and the wide roads were packed, creating a grand scene of tens of thousands of people vying to see Premier Zhou and everyone shouting "Sino-Cambodian friendship." The open car had to slow down, and Premier Zhou constantly clasped his hands together in greeting to the welcoming crowds.
    Those who came to welcome Premier Zhou were not only residents of Phnom Penh, but also Cambodian people from the suburbs and from all over the country, including many overseas Chinese. It was reported that on the day before Premier Zhou arrived in Phnom Penh (the 4th), the number of buses from the countryside to Phnom Penh suddenly increased, most of these buses being chartered by people who had come specifically to welcome Premier Zhou. On the evening of the 4th, the streets of Phnom Penh were filled with many visitors from the countryside, and were bustling with activity. Hotels were fully booked, and some schools were even made available for these enthusiastic welcomers to stay temporarily. A farmer from the countryside expressed the feelings of these welcomers. He said: "China is a large country, and it treats our small country very well, helping us develop our industry. How important is this to us farmers! How can we not come to welcome the Chinese Premier?"
    Cambodian friends told us that the enthusiasm for welcoming Premier Zhou this time, no matter from which aspect, exceeded that for any other visiting state guest. It is currently the period of national mourning in Cambodia for the unfortunate passing of King Suramarit, and flags should normally be flown at half-mast, but the Royal Government issued an order to fly flags at full-mast to welcome Premier Zhou Enlai's visit. The Royal Government also specially established a reception committee composed of 43 members to receive Premier Zhou's visit, with Second Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Prince Norodom Phurissara, as chairman. The cityscape of Phnom Penh was specially renovated, the roads were repaired and widened, and the utility poles and tree trunks along the roads were painted white. On the day of Premier Zhou's arrival, more than 200 flagpoles were erected along the highway from the airport to the Royal Palace, each flagpole displaying the Cambodian and Chinese national flags, and hundreds of specially made large Cambodian and Chinese national flags fluttered in the wind along both sides of the highway. Magnificent archways and hundreds of horizontal banners further expressed the Cambodian government's and people's warm welcome to Premier Zhou and the Cambodian and Chinese people's love for peace. They read: "Long live Sino-Cambodian friendship!" "Long live the People's Republic of China! Long live the Kingdom of Cambodia!" "Welcome, Your Excellency Premier Zhou!" "Welcome, Your Excellency Chen Yi!" "Long live peaceful coexistence!" "Long live world peace!"
    The friendship and deep affection of the Kingdom of Cambodia's government and people for the Chinese government and people are indescribable. The Royal Government's grand reception and the enthusiastic welcome of the people reflect the Cambodian people's friendly wishes towards the Chinese people. The Cambodian "Friendship News" put it well: "Whenever the imperialists and their lackeys point their iron forks at Cambodia's neck, China always stands by Cambodia to defend Cambodia. China is Cambodia's sincere friend, so we must welcome Premier Zhou Enlai with the honor due to a friend." (Attached image)

    金边倾城欢迎周总理
    新华社记者　于民生　张瑶
    金边的天气，热得实在惊人：室内的寒暑表已经升到摄氏三十七度，太阳晒得马路上的柏油都溶化了。然而，柬埔寨人民对中国人民满怀友谊的心情比天气更热。在周恩来总理、陈毅副总理和随行人员到达金边这一天，我们看到的是欢腾的人海、如林的彩旗，我们听到的是连绵不绝的友谊欢呼声和响彻云霄的热烈的鼓掌声。可以毫不夸张的说，金边倾城欢迎周总理。
    还在周总理到达以前，柬埔寨皇家电台就通过广播，号召人民踊跃欢迎周恩来总理，“以便对这位伟大的友人表达我们的喜悦和欢迎”。电台说：“这将显示我们柬埔寨国家和人民是有文化、懂得珍视友谊和懂得以高贵的仪式来欢迎我们国家的贵宾的。”
    柬埔寨的领导者和人民的确非常珍视中柬友谊。当中国贵宾到达的时候，西哈努克亲王、福·波伦首相和议会两院议员、政府所有的高级官员，都到机场热烈相迎。西哈努克亲王是那么兴奋和激动，他久久地握着周恩来总理和陈毅副总理的手，愉快的寒喧交谈。在这一刹那，不禁令人想起了具有历史意义的万隆会议。周总理、陈副总理和西哈努克亲王，就是在那次会议上第一次相识的。从那次会议以来，西哈努克亲王曾经两度访问中国，周恩来总理现在也是第二次到柬埔寨作客。中柬两国之间的经济合作和文化交流加强和扩大了，贸易额逐渐增加了，各种代表团的互相访问日益频繁了。千年来，中柬两国人民一直是友好的，可是从来没有像今天这样亲密。
    机场上动人的场面太多了，这里不能不写的是机场上的欢迎队伍，其中王国政府各部门的欢迎队伍特别醒目。他们举着用中文写的各部门名字的横标，依次排列着。当周总理走过的时候，顿时热情奔放，雀跃欢呼，许多人用中国话高喊：“柬中人民友好万岁！”我们曾经遇见一位在计划部门任职的头发已经有些斑白的老者，谈起欢迎周总理，他非常激动地说：“我们每个人都真诚的、热烈的欢迎中国总理，因为中国是我们最可靠的邻邦。中国的援助的确给我们柬埔寨人带来了好处。”
    最感动人的还是从机场到王宫长达十公里的道路两旁的数以十万计的群众夹道欢迎的盛况。所有的人都穿着最新的或最鲜艳的衣服，几乎每一个人都手持一面中国国旗或柬埔寨国旗。当周总理和西哈努克亲王乘敞篷车经过的时候，人们挥舞着旗帜、草帽和手帕，尽情地鼓掌、呼口号。汽车进入市区以后，欢迎的群众越来越多，广阔的道路两旁水泄不通，出现了万人争看周总理、大家齐喊柬中友好的盛况。敞篷车不得不放慢速度行进，周总理不断合十向欢迎的群众致意。
    来欢迎周总理的，不仅有金边的市民，而且有来自郊区和来自全国各地的柬埔寨人民，其中还有许多华侨。有消息说，在周总理到达金边的前一天（4日）白天，从四乡到金边的客车骤然增加，这些客车多数是专程赶来欢迎周总理的人租赁的。4日晚间，金边街头添了很多四乡来客，热闹非凡，旅馆客满，有的学校也让出来给这些热情的欢迎者暂住。一位来自乡间的农民道出了这些欢迎者的心情。他说：“中国是个大国，它对我们这个小国很好，帮助我们发展工业，这对我们农民关系多么大啊！中国总理的到来叫我们怎么能不赶来欢迎呢？”
    柬埔寨朋友告诉我们，这次对周总理的欢迎的热烈程度，不论从那一方面说，都超过了对其他任何一个来访的国宾。现在正值柬埔寨全国对苏拉玛里特国王不幸逝世举行国丧期间，本来应该悬半旗，但王国政府通令悬满旗迎接周恩来总理的来访。王国政府还特别成立了由四十三位委员组成的接待周总理来访的委员会，第二副首相兼外交大臣泰潘亲任主席。金边的市容特别进行了整顿，道路经过修整加宽，路两旁的电线杆、树干都刷上了白粉。在周总理到达的这一天，从机场到王宫的公路两旁竖了二百多根旗杆，每根旗杆上都插着柬、中两国国旗，还有成百面特制大幅柬、中两国国旗，沿着公路两旁迎风招展。一座又一座雄伟的彩牌楼和几百幅横幅标语，更道出了柬埔寨政府和人民热情欢迎周总理和柬中人民热爱和平的心声。那上面写道：“中柬友谊万岁！”“中华人民共和国万岁！柬埔寨王国万岁！”“欢迎周总理阁下！”“欢迎陈毅阁下！”“和平共处万岁！”“世界和平万岁！”
    柬埔寨王国政府和人民对中国政府和人民的友谊和深情是难以描述的。王国政府的隆重接待和人民群众的热烈欢迎，体现了柬埔寨人民对中国人民友好的愿望。柬埔寨“友谊报”说得好：“每当帝国主义及其走狗拿着铁叉对准柬埔寨的脖子的时候，中国总是站在柬埔寨旁边捍卫柬埔寨。中国是柬埔寨真诚的朋友，所以我们要以友人的荣誉来欢迎周恩来总理。”（附图片）
