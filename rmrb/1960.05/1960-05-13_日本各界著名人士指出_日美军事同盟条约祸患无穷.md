Editor's Note: The following are excerpts from the speeches of people from all walks of life in Japan opposing Nobusuke Kishi's attempt to forcibly approve the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty in the Diet, translated from the April 25th issue of the Japanese "Akahata" newspaper and the May issue of the Japanese "Sekai" magazine. From this, we can see how unpopular the actions of U.S. imperialism and its follower, Nobusuke Kishi, to drag Japan back onto the path of aggression and war are within Japan.
        Violates Humanity's Desire for Peace
    Senroku Uehara, Former Professor at Hitotsubashi University, Japan: The Kishi Nobusuke government's policy of strengthening U.S.-Japan military collusion and creating tension in Asia fundamentally violates humanity's desire for peace. The U.S.-Japan military alliance formed by this treaty means forming a new military treaty group with Taiwan and South Korea. This will make the Japanese authorities' attitude of hostility towards China and the Soviet Union even more stubborn, which not only threatens peace in the Far East but also blocks the path for the people's desire to restore Japan-China diplomatic relations.
    According to this treaty, U.S. troops will be stationed in Japan and are scheduled to take joint combat actions with the "Self-Defense Forces," which will inevitably lead to the transport of nuclear weapons and the dispatch of troops overseas. This treaty strengthens the Japanese military system. As a result, the basic human rights and freedoms of the Japanese people will be deprived, and democratic rights will be infringed upon.
      Tramples on the Will of the Japanese People
    Kinnosuke Ogura, President of the History of Science Society of Japan: The U.S.-Japan military alliance formed by the new "Security Treaty" seriously violates the position of the Japanese Constitution, tramples on the will of the peace-loving Japanese people, and hinders and damages the people's strong desire to restore Japan-China diplomatic relations. The result is that the ever-increasing burden of military spending oppresses the people's lives and strengthens the reactionary suppression of democratic rights.
        Exacerbates Tensions in Asia
    Yoshitaro Hirano, Director of the China Research Institute: The U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty stipulates that U.S. troops will be stationed in Japan for the sake of "peace and security in the Far East." However, ignoring or even being hostile to neighboring People's Republic of China, only consulting with the United States and using military action to solve the problem of peace in the Far East will instead exacerbate the tense situation in Asia. The U.S. government has already concluded military treaties with the Rhee government of South Korea and Chiang Kai-shek, and adding this treaty with Japan increases the risk of Japan being dragged into disputes over the Korean and Taiwan issues.
      Makes Japan a Gendarme of the Far East
    Tadashi Ishimoda, Professor at Hosei University, Japan: The U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" aims to rebuild Japanese militarism by relying on the power of U.S. imperialism in the Far East. Past history proves that Japanese militarism is a dangerous system that the Japanese people must fight thoroughly. Moreover, the purpose of this treaty is to arm Japan, not only to be hostile to China and the Soviet Union but also to confront Korea and all liberation movements in Southeast Asia, forcing our country to once again become a gendarme of the Far East. I believe that a new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" with such a nature will bring nothing but misfortune and disaster to the people of Japan and the countries of the Far East.
    Makes Japan's Independence and Autonomy Disappear Completely
    Hiroshi Minami, Professor at Hitotsubashi University, Japan: The U.S.-Japan military alliance formed under the new "Security Treaty" is a new threat to world peace. This is not the path that Japan should take.
    This treaty further forces Japan to be subordinate to the United States, making the country's independence and autonomy disappear completely. According to this treaty, the tendency to expand the military budget domestically and intensify the revival of militarism increasingly shrouds the daily life and culture of the people in a dark shadow.
    Harms Relations Between Japan and Asian Countries
    Hakuro Eguchi, Professor at the University of Tokyo, Japan: The new "Security Treaty" stipulates that U.S. troops will be stationed in Japan and conduct joint operations with the "Self-Defense Forces." I believe this will make the danger of transporting nuclear weapons and dispatching troops overseas a reality, thus seriously endangering Japan's peace.
    I believe that Japan should abandon its policy of strengthening its military strength, take on international responsibilities, and work towards peace. I think the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" goes against this direction. The most direct problem is that this treaty hinders relations with China and other peace-loving people in Asia.
    Nobuyuki Tatsuno, Japanese Writer: I oppose the Diet's approval of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."
    Japan should always adhere to neutrality, and signing a new "Security Treaty" with the United States is clearly unconstitutional. Today's Japanese politics and diplomacy are not essentially different from when Perry came to Japan a hundred years ago (referring to the United States sending Perry to Japan with a fleet in 1860, using gunboat diplomacy to threaten Japan into signing the first unequal "U.S.-Japan Treaty of Amity and Commerce" - Editor's note), which is truly regrettable.
      Threatens the Basic Survival Rights of the Japanese People
    Takeo Okuno, Japanese Literary Critic: I absolutely oppose the Diet's approval of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." I believe that there is no other way to prevent the approval of the new "Security Treaty" except to awaken the awareness deep within the hearts of every one of the people and persist in a tenacious movement against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."
    Because the new "Security Treaty" is a treaty that threatens our basic survival rights, as a person, one cannot but oppose it.
    Takeshi Matsuo, Japanese Pastor: I oppose the Diet's approval of the new "Security Treaty."
    Because I believe that the current constitution, which declares the renunciation of armed force, has great significance; only by truly following this path can the people become a people beneficial to human history. And this is the task currently facing Japan.
      Once Again Point the Guns at China
    Yoshio Inoue, Professor at Tokyo Union Theological Seminary: I oppose the Diet's approval of the new "Security Treaty."
    There are various reasons for this. What is particularly shocking is the need to once again point the guns at China, which suffered deeply from Japanese aggression in the Pacific War. We cannot tolerate this even from the most ordinary sense of morality.
    Keibun Nishikawa, Nichiren Buddhist Monk: I oppose the Diet's approval of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty"! (I feel angry!)
    Hideko Takamine, Actress: I oppose the Diet's approval of the new "Security Treaty"!
          Puts Japan in Danger of Being Involved in War
    Itaru Kikumura, Writer: I oppose the Diet's approval of the new "Security Treaty."
    No matter what the situation, I am absolutely opposed to Japan taking up arms to fight again. The new "Security Treaty" is based on the premise that Japan has the possibility of being involved in this danger.

### 日本各界著名人士指出  日美军事同盟条约祸患无穷

    日本各界著名人士指出
    日美军事同盟条约祸患无穷
    编者按　这里发表的，是摘译自4月25日日本“赤旗报”和5月号日本“世界”杂志的日本各界人士反对岸信介企图在国会强行批准日美军事同盟条约的一部分言论。从这里可以看到美帝国主义及其追随者岸信介企图把日本重新拖上侵略与战争道路的作法，在日本国内是多么地不得人心。
        违反人类和平愿望
    前日本一桥大学教授　上原专禄：岸信介政府加强日美军事勾结、在亚洲制造紧张局势的方针，是根本违反人类和平愿望的。由于这一条约而结成的日美军事同盟，意味着同台湾、南朝鲜等形成新的军事条约集团。这将使日本当局敌视中苏的态度更加顽固，既威胁远东的和平，又堵塞了人民渴望恢复日中邦交的道路。
    根据这一条约，美军驻在日本并预定同“自卫队”采取共同作战行动，结果必然会运进核武器和向海外派兵。这一条约是加强日本军事体系的东西。这样一来，日本人民的基本人权自由将遭到剥夺，民主权利将被侵犯。
      蹂躏日本人民的意志
    日本科学史学会会长　小仓金之助：由于新“安全条约”而结成的日美军事同盟，严重地违反日本宪法的立场，蹂躏爱好和平的日本人民的意志，阻挠和损害人民要求恢复日中邦交的强烈愿望。结果是日益增多的军费重担压迫人民生活，加强对民主权利的反动镇压。
        加剧亚洲紧张局势
    中国研究所所长　平野义太郎：日美军事同盟条约规定，美军为了“远东的和平与安全”而驻在日本。但是，忽视甚至敌视邻邦中华人民共和国，只同美国协商并以军事行动来解决远东和平的问题，反而会加剧亚洲的紧张形势。美国政府已经缔结了美李、美蒋等军事条约，再加上同日本缔结的这个条约，就增加了有使日本卷入朝鲜和台湾问题纠纷的危险。
      使日本成为远东的宪兵
    日本法政大学教授　石母田正：日美“安全条约”以依靠美帝国主义在远东的势力来重建日本军国主义为目标。过去的历史证明，日本军国主义是日本人民必须与之进行彻底斗争的危险制度。而且，这个条约的目的是要把日本武装起来，不仅敌视中苏，还要对抗朝鲜及东南亚的一切解放运动，强迫我国再一次成为远东的宪兵。我相信，具有这样性质的新日美“安全条约”除了给日本及远东各国人民带来不幸和灾难，不会有别的东西。
    使日本独立自主丧失殆尽
    日本一桥大学教授　南博：根据新“安全条约”而结成的日美军事同盟，对世界和平是一个新的威胁。这不是日本所应走的道路。
    这一条约进一步强迫日本从属于美国，使国家的独立和自主丧失殆尽。根据这一条约在国内扩大军事预算和加紧复活军国主义的倾向，使人民的日常生活和文化日益笼罩在阴暗的影子下。
    危害日本和亚洲国家关系
    日本东京大学教授　江口朴郎：新“安全条约”规定美军驻在日本和同“自卫队”进行共同作战。我认为这会使运进核武器和向海外派兵的危险变为现实，因而严重地危害日本的和平。
    我认为日本应该放弃增强军事实力的政策，负起国际责任，朝着和平的方向努力。我认为新日美“安全条约”是同这个方向背道而驰的。最直接的问题，就是这个条约妨害同中国及其他亚洲国家爱好和平人民的关系。
    日本作家　立野信之：我反对国会批准新日美“安全条约”。
    日本应该始终坚守中立，而同美国签订新“安全条约”显然是违反宪法的。今天的日本政治和外交和一百年前佩里来日（指1860年美国派佩里率舰队到日本，以炮舰政策威胁日本签订第一个丧权辱国的“日美修好条约”——编者）时没有任何本质的不同，实在令人悲叹。
      威胁日本人民基本生存权利
    日本文艺评论家　奥野健男：我绝对反对在国会批准新日美“安全条约”。我认为除了唤起人民群众每一个人内心深处的觉悟，坚持顽强的反对日美“安全条约”运动以外，没有其它阻止批准新“安全条约”的方法。
    因为新“安全条约”是威胁我们基本生存权利的条约，所以作为一个人来说也是不能不反对的。
    日本牧师　松尾武：我反对国会批准新“安全条约”。
    因为我认为宣布放弃武力的现行宪法，具有重大的意义；国民只有真正沿着这条道路，才能够成为有益于人类历史的国民。而这就是日本当前所面临的课题。
      再一次把枪口对准中国
    东京神学大学教授　井上良雄：我反对国会批准新“安全条约”。
    这有各种各样的理由。其中特别使人震动的是要再一次把枪口对准在太平洋战争中深受日本侵略祸患的中国。我们即使从最普通的道义感出发，也是不能容忍的。
    日莲宗和尚　西川景文：我反对国会批准新日美“安全条约”！（我感到愤怒）演员　高峰秀子：我反对国会批准新“安全条约”！
          使日本卷入战争危险
    作家　菊村到：我反对国会批准新“安全条约”。
    不论情况如何，日本重新拿起武器作战，我是绝对反对的。新“安全条约”是以日本有被卷入这种危险的可能性为前提的。
