    Vigorously Popularize and Improve Childcare Work
    Our great ideal and goal is to build a happy and beautiful communist society. People are working diligently towards this ideal. Our labor must, on the one hand, prepare the "material" conditions for a communist society, and on the other hand, prepare the "human" conditions for a communist society. The latter is to cultivate new people with high communist qualities and all-round development in body, mind, and intellect. This work should not only start from schools, but should also start from childhood, to cultivate them into noble-minded, and genuine successors to communism. For this reason, our efforts to do a good job in childcare today are directly related to the most fundamental and important issue of communist construction, and are an extremely important political task at present. At the same time, vigorously popularizing and improving childcare work is also of great significance to the complete liberation of women's labor force.
    With the large-scale establishment of people's communes in urban and rural areas, the large-scale organization of production, and the large-scale establishment of collective welfare and social service undertakings, people's family lives have undergone fundamental changes. Household labor is gradually being socialized, and the tasks of caring for the elderly and raising children are gradually shifting from being the responsibility of the family to being the responsibility of society. Engels pointed out long ago: "With the transformation of the means of production into social property, the individual family will no longer be the economic unit of society. Private housework will become a social industry, and the care and education of children will become a public matter; society will equally care for all children." In our country, the policy of giving priority to social education in children's education is being implemented. Collective upbringing of children has unparalleled advantages over the dispersed upbringing by individual families. Although our country has entered the period of socialist construction, and the socialist and communist consciousness of the people has greatly improved, the scattered family life left over from the private ownership system will inevitably bring selfish and narrow-minded psychology and concepts to children. After children's upbringing becomes social and collective, children will grow up in collective life from an early age, receive communist education, and develop good morals of unity, mutual assistance, and selflessness. At the same time, many places, due to the existence of a group of relatively excellent childcare workers in nurseries and kindergartens, are gradually equipped with more favorable conditions in ensuring the health and safety of children than the dispersed upbringing by individual families. It should be said that the collective life of nurseries and kindergartens is the most appropriate place to cultivate children's collectivist thinking from an early age.
    Childcare services in various parts of our country, especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, have made great progress. According to statistics at the end of 1959, there were more than 3.6 million rural childcare organizations nationwide, an increase of 7.8% compared with the same period in 1958. Urban kindergartens and nurseries have also made great progress in the current situation of large-scale urban people's communes. Many nurseries and kindergartens have developed rapidly based on the spirit of diligence and thrift in running the garden, self-reliance, starting from scratch, and growing from small to large, and have accumulated rich experience. Many regions, based on the spirit of continuous revolution, have made childcare institutions networked and complete. For example, some regions in Sichuan, Henan, and Heilongjiang provinces have formed maternity hospitals, nurseries, and kindergartens into a whole, and assumed all the responsibilities for the care and education of preschool children. In terms of service content, it is not limited to children's education and food supply. Some nurseries and kindergartens even take care of children's bathing, haircuts, medical treatment, and sewing and mending clothes. Many childcare organizations have paid attention to adjusting diets, increasing nutrition, and setting fixed times and amounts to ensure normal development of children; they have also strived to achieve early prevention and early treatment of diseases, and conscientiously implement health care systems. Some regions with better conditions have implemented division of labor and centralized and unified management, and established children's nutrition canteens, children's isolation and recuperation centers, children's bathrooms, children's barbershops, and children's clothing sewing and washing shops; this makes social division of labor more rational, management more convenient, and plays a great role in improving childcare work. In particular, all kindergartens and nurseries have paid attention to educating children with collectivist ideas. Therefore, the quality of childcare has been continuously improved; children quickly develop the habit of loving labor and loving the collective after entering the garden, and they can sing and dance, and are lively and healthy. These vivid examples fully demonstrate the superiority of collective upbringing of children. At the same time, it has changed some people's old concepts and habits, helped them get used to collective life, and accepted new things.
    With the continuous development of socialist construction, women have participated in social labor more widely. In places where nurseries and kindergartens have not yet been established, many children urgently need to enter nurseries and kindergartens. Therefore, there is an urgent need to vigorously popularize and improve childcare work, and to establish and run nurseries and kindergartens well, so that children's mothers can work and study with peace of mind. As required in the Resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, efforts should be made to "make every child live and be educated better than at home, so that children are willing to stay there, and parents are willing to put their children there." Whether nurseries and kindergartens are sufficient and well-run is a question of whether we can cultivate successors to communism who are healthy in body and mind, whether women can leave their families to participate in social production labor and whether they can work and study happily and with peace of mind after participating in production labor, and is related to the speed of socialist construction and the acceleration of the complete liberation of women.
    Now, childcare has become a cause of the whole people and the whole society, and has increasingly received the spiritual and material support and care of the people of the whole country. Many rural and urban people's communes can start from scratch and set up nurseries and kindergartens because they have mobilized the masses and received the support of the broad masses. The broad masses urgently need nurseries and kindergartens, and they will inevitably take out the enthusiasm for production to develop childcare services. Once the masses are mobilized, difficulties can be solved easily. In places where kindergartens and nurseries have not yet been established, the whole party should act, the whole people should be mobilized, levels should be responsible, and nurseries and kindergartens should be organized in stages and batches to vigorously popularize and improve childcare work. Urban street organizations, factories and mines, and all people's communes and production brigades should further strengthen their leadership over childcare work. Wherever childcare organizations have been established, we should deeply and meticulously solve the difficulties in the equipment of nurseries and kindergartens and the problems in management work, often care about the political and ideological situation of childcare workers, solve the difficulties they encounter in their work, and strengthen the backbone allocation of nurseries and kindergartens. When various places are establishing nurseries and kindergartens on a large scale, they should especially emphasize the mutual cooperation and vigorous collaboration between agencies, schools, enterprises, and streets, so that nurseries and kindergartens are scattered all over the place, networked and complete.
    At present, all localities should pay special attention to running nurseries and lactation rooms for children under the age of three, because children under the age of three have weak resistance, they cannot speak or cannot speak much, and need particularly careful care. Therefore, establishing and running such nurseries and lactation rooms more often is of special importance to cultivating children's physical and mental health from an early age and ensuring that mothers can work in production with peace of mind. At present, such nurseries and lactation rooms are still few, and experience is still insufficient, and more special care is needed from various places and units.
    In order to improve the quality of childcare work, we must improve the ideological consciousness and professional level of childcare workers and educators. In the past ten years, we have trained a team of more than 6 million childcare workers, accumulated a set of childcare work experience, and qualified childcare workers who are both red and expert are increasing in large numbers. However, compared with today's rapidly developing situation, the growth of the childcare workers' team, both in quantity and quality, still cannot meet the needs of the development of the situation. Therefore, it is necessary to vigorously train childcare personnel with high communist consciousness, considerable cultural and scientific knowledge, and professional knowledge. In training childcare personnel, it is also necessary to implement the policy of educational revolution, to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology, to integrate theory with practice, to combine popularization and improvement, and to establish training bases and training systems. In the past few years, the method of combining short-term training and longer-term professional training has been adopted to train a group of childcare personnel, which has adapted to the development and needs of the Great Leap Forward. In the future, with the further development of work, we must proceed from reality and have long-term plans. In addition to continuing to adopt the policy of walking on two legs with short-term training and long-term training, women's federations, health and education departments in various places should also plan to open nurse schools with a three-year graduation period to train childcare workers and kindergarten normal schools to train educators. Medical colleges and normal colleges should also set up classes and departments for pediatricians, childcare nurse classes, and preschool education departments to train a large number of qualified childcare workers. At the same time, we should pay attention to adhering to spare-time study, carrying out socialist competitions, organizing exhibitions, performance competitions, business lectures, and all-inclusive teaching and learning. At present, we should also set up some nurseries and kindergartens with better specifications and quality. The health department should allocate a group of nurses and send them to these demonstration nurseries and kindergartens after one or two months of childcare work training to strengthen their work and strive to run these nurseries and kindergartens well, set an example, and drive and improve the work of all nurseries and kindergartens.
    Now, at a time when rural people's communes are being further consolidated, the urban people's commune movement is also developing vigorously, the need to develop childcare services is becoming more and more urgent, and the conditions for running childcare services well are becoming more and more favorable. It is hoped that all childcare workers will closely follow the needs of the times and run this great and glorious cause more, faster, better, and more economically!

### 大力普及和提高保育工作

    大力普及和提高保育工作
    我们的伟大理想和奋斗目标，是建设幸福美好的共产主义社会。人们正在为这一理想辛勤地劳动着。我们的劳动，一方面要为共产主义社会准备“物”的条件，一方面要为共产主义社会准备“人”的条件。后者就是要培养有高度共产主义品质的体、德、智全面发展的新人。这一工作，不仅从学校开始，而应当从儿童时期开始，培养他们成为风格高尚的、名副其实的共产主义接班人。正因为如此，今天我们努力做好保育工作，就是直接关系到共产主义建设的最基本的大问题，是现在一项极其重要的政治任务。同时，大力普及和提高保育工作，对彻底解放妇女劳动力，也具有极重大的意义。
    在我国城乡大办人民公社、大量组织生产、大办集体福利事业和社会服务事业的同时，人们的家庭生活发生了根本的变化。家务劳动逐渐社会化了，养老育幼的任务，逐渐由家庭负责转为由社会负责。恩格斯早已指出过：“随着生产资料转化为社会公有，个体家庭也不会再是社会的经济单位。私人的家务将变为社会的工业，孩子的照管和教养将成为公众的事情；社会将同等地关怀一切儿童。”在我们国家里，正在贯彻执行儿童教育要以社会教育为主的方针。集体教养儿童，比一家一户分散教养的方式，具有无比的优越性。虽然，我们国家已经进入社会主义建设时期，人民群众的社会主义、共产主义觉悟大大提高，但是私有制遗留下来的一家一户分散的家庭生活，不可避免地会给孩子带来自私狭隘的心理和观念。儿童的教养变成社会的集体教养以后，孩子们从小在集体生活里成长，受共产主义教育，就将养成团结互助大公无私的良好品德。同时，很多地方由于托儿所、幼儿园已经有一批比较优秀的保育工作人员，在保证孩子的健康和安全方面，也逐渐比一家一户的分散教养具备更为有利的条件。应当说，托儿所、幼儿园的集体生活，是自幼培养儿童集体主义思想的最适当的地方。
    我国各地的保育事业，特别是1958年大跃进以来，有很大的发展。据1959年年底的统计：全国农村托儿组织已达三百六十多万个，比1958年同期增加了7.8％。城市幼儿园、托儿所在目前大办城市人民公社的情况下，也有很大的发展。很多托儿所和幼儿园本着勤俭办园、自力更生、从无到有、从小到大的精神，很快发展起来了，而且取得了丰富的经验。不少地区本着不断革命的精神，使保教机构成网成套，如四川、河南、黑龙江等省有些地区把妇产院、托儿所、幼儿园组成一个整体，把学前儿童的教养责任全部担当起来。在服务内容上，不仅限于对孩子的教育和供给伙食，有些托儿所和幼儿园连儿童的洗澡、理发、看病、缝衣补袜全包下来。许多托儿组织都注意了调整饮食，增加营养，定时定量，使孩子发育正常；还努力作到对疾病的早期预防、早期治疗，认真执行卫生保健制度。有些条件较好的地区实行分工分业和集中统一管理，成立儿童营养食堂、儿童隔离休养所、儿童浴室、儿童理发室、童装缝洗店；这样使社会分工更加合理，管理更加方便，对提高保教工作起了很大作用。特别是各个幼儿园和托儿所都注意以集体主义思想教育儿童。因此，保教质量得到不断提高；孩子们入园后很快就养成爱劳动、爱集体的习惯，能歌能舞，活泼健壮。这些生动活泼的事例，充分显示了集体教养儿童的优越性。同时改变了一些人的旧观念和老习惯，帮助他们习惯了集体生活，接受了新鲜事物。
    随着社会主义建设事业的不断发展，妇女更加广泛地参加了社会劳动，现在尚未组成托儿所和幼儿园的地方，很多的孩子迫切需要入托儿所、幼儿园。因此，当前迫切需要大力普及和提高保育工作，多办和办好托儿所、幼儿园，使孩子们的妈妈能够安心生产、工作和学习。像中共中央八届六中全会决议中所要求的，应该努力“使每一个孩子比在家里生活得好、教育得好，使孩子们愿意留在那里，父母也愿意把孩子放在那里。”托儿所、幼儿园办得够不够，办得好不好，是能不能培养出身心健康的共产主义接班人的问题，是妇女能不能离开家庭参加社会生产劳动和参加生产劳动后能不能安心地愉快地工作和学习的问题，是关系到社会主义建设的速度的问题和加速妇女的彻底解放的问题。
    现在，保育事业已经变成全民、全社会的事业，已经越来越多地得到全国人民在精神上、物质上的支援和关怀。许多农村和城市人民公社，所以能白手起家，办起托儿所、幼儿园，就是因为发动了群众，得到广大群众的支持。广大群众迫切需要托儿所、幼儿园，就必然会拿出搞生产的热情来发展保育事业。群众一经发动起来，困难就能迎刃而解。在尚未举办幼儿园、托儿所的地方，应全党动手，全民动员，层层负责，分期分批地把托儿所、幼儿园组织起来，大力普及和提高保育工作。城市街道组织、厂矿企业和各人民公社、生产大队都应当进一步加强对保育工作的领导。凡是已经建立起托儿组织的地方，应该深入、细致地解决托儿所、幼儿园设备上的困难和管理工作中的问题，经常关怀保育工作人员的政治思想情况，解决她们在工作中遇到的困难，加强托儿所、幼儿园的骨干配备。各地在大办托儿所、幼儿园的时候，要特别强调机关、学校、企业、街道互相配合，大力协作，使托儿所、幼儿园星罗棋布、成网成套。
    目前，各地应特别注意办好三岁以下孩子的托儿所和哺乳室，因为三岁以下儿童抵抗力弱，他们不会说话或不大会说话，需要特别细致的抚育。因此多办和办好这种托儿所、哺乳室，对从小培养儿童的身心健康和保证母亲们安心生产劳动，有特殊重要的意义。目前这种托儿所、哺乳室还办得少，经验还不足，就更需要各地各单位加以特别的关怀。
    为了提高保育工作的质量，必须提高保育员和教养员的思想觉悟和业务水平。十年来，我们已培养了一支六百多万人的保育工作者队伍，积累了一套保育工作经验，又红又专的合格的保育工作人员正在大量地增加。但是，保育工作者队伍的成长，与今天迅速发展的形势比较起来，无论数量上和质量上都还不能满足形势发展的需要。因此必须大力培养具有高度共产主义觉悟的，具有相当文化科学知识和专业知识的保育工作人材。在培训保育工作人材的时候，同样要贯彻教育革命的方针，要兴无灭资，要理论联系实际，要普及和提高相结合，还要建立培训基地和培训体系。过去几年采取短期培养训练和较长期的专业训练相结合的办法，培养训练了一批保教人员，这种办法，适应了大跃进形势的发展和需要。今后随着工作的进一步发展的需要，我们既要从实际出发，又要有长远打算，除继续采取短期培养和长期培训的两条腿走路的方针以外，各地妇女联合会、卫生、教育部门，还应该有计划地开办三年毕业的专门训练保育员的护士学校和训练教养员的幼稚师范，在医学院和师范学院，也应该设立儿科医生的班、系及保育护士班、学前教育系等班次，培养训练大批合格的保育工作者。同时，应该注意坚持业余学习，开展社会主义竞赛，组织展览会，表演赛，业务讲座，包教包学。目前我们还应当办起一些规格质量更好的托儿所、幼儿园来，卫生部门应该调拨一批护士，经过一两个月的保育工作训练，就派到这种示范托儿所和幼儿园去加强工作，努力办好这些托儿所和幼儿园，作出榜样，带动和提高所有托儿所和幼儿园的工作。
    现在，在农村人民公社进一步巩固的时候，城市人民公社化运动又蓬蓬勃勃地发展起来，发展保育事业的需要越来越急迫，办好保育事业的条件也越来越有利，希望全体保育工作者紧紧跟上时代的需要，把这项伟大而光荣的事业办得更多更快更好更省！
