Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou Electric News: Guangdong's Shantou Prefecture has recently suffered from torrential rains. More than one million anti-flood troops in the entire prefecture, under the strong leadership of the Party and relying on the powerful force of the people's communes, overcame the mountain floods and waterlogging caused by the extraordinary rainstorm in just two days. In some areas where the rainstorms were most concentrated, the masses and poultry who had been trapped by the water have been safely rescued. As of the 7th, the water levels of all major rivers in the district had fallen below the warning line, and all major dikes, reservoirs, and ponds were safe and sound. Of the 1.82 million mu of crops that were flooded, more than 1.42 million mu had been drained of water. Now, cadres and the masses throughout the region, with the tenacious will of "achieving a great harvest even in the face of a major flood," are rapidly restoring production, redoubling their efforts, and launching a campaign of post-disaster field management with increased fertilization and cultivation, determined to recover the losses from the flood.

On the 4th of this month, some areas of Shantou Prefecture experienced torrential rains, the intensity and amount of which were unprecedented. In the Chao-Shan Plain counties located in the center of the rainstorm, the rainfall in one day reached more than 400 millimeters. In Zhanlong Commune of Puning County, which had the most rainfall, it even reached 800 millimeters. After the rain, mountain floods broke out everywhere, and waterlogging formed on the plains. At this critical moment, Tao Zhu, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, who was inspecting work in Shantou Prefecture, personally directed this battle, listened to reports from various places every day, gave specific instructions in a timely manner, and immediately telegraphed relevant departments of the province to ship a large number of materials and equipment from Guangzhou and allocate 650,000 yuan in relief funds to support the disaster areas in restoring production. Luo Tian, First Secretary of the Prefectural Committee, personally went to Puning and Chaoyang counties to direct the efforts. A large number of responsible cadres from counties and people's communes throughout the region joined the vast anti-flood army in rescue and relief efforts. The Air Force of the People's Liberation Army also dispatched aircraft to airdrop dry food to Puning, Chaoyang and other places to support the masses trapped by the water. Industrial, transportation, postal and telecommunications, and commercial departments in the prefecture and Shantou City also fully supported the rescue and relief efforts.

In the battle against flood and waterlogging, and rescuing crops, the unparalleled superiority of the people's communes was once again demonstrated. All communes unified the use of manpower and materials for disaster relief and supported each other. In Chaonan County, on the 6th alone, 150,000 people were mobilized to excavate and dredge 8,457 drainage ditches, so that all 170,000 mu of waterlogged dry land in the county were completely drained of water.

The rapid drainage of waterlogging and the ability to quickly subdue the flood was also due to the tremendous role played by the large number of drainage, irrigation, and water storage projects newly built since the Great Leap Forward. The area near Huanggang Town in Raoping County has always been prone to flooding by the Huanggang River. This year, thanks to the construction of the Tangxi Reservoir, which blocked and stored the floodwaters, although there was 400 millimeters of rain, no flooding occurred downstream. The Neiyang drainage project built by several communes in Chaoan County this spring also played a huge role, enabling the waterlogging of more than 100,000 mu of farmland to be completely drained within a day.

    依靠党的领导　发挥公社强大威力
    汕头专区制服山洪内涝
    陶铸同志亲自指挥战斗受灾群众迅速脱险
    据新华社广州电　广东汕头专区部分地区最近遭受了暴雨侵袭。全专区一百多万抗洪大军，在党的坚强领导下，依靠人民公社的强大威力，在短短两天内，就克服了特大暴雨所带来的山洪内涝灾害。在暴雨最集中的一些地区，曾经被水围困的群众和家禽，已经安全出险。到7日止，全区各大江河水位全部下降到警戒线以下，各主要堤围和水库山塘等工程都安然无恙，受浸的一百八十二万亩农作物，已有一百四十二万多亩，排干了渍水。现在，全区干部和群众正以“遭遇大水也要大丰收”的顽强意志，迅速恢复生产，加倍鼓起干劲，开展一个加施肥料、加工培育的后期田间管理运动，决心夺回水灾损失。
    本月4日，汕头专区部分地区下了暴雨，雨势之猛，雨量之多，为历来所仅见。位于暴雨中心的潮汕平原各县，一天的降雨量达到四百多毫米。最多的普宁县占陇公社竟达到八百毫米。雨后各地山洪暴发，平地也形成内涝。在这个严重的时刻，正在汕头专区检查工作的省委第一书记陶铸亲自指挥这一场战斗，每天听取各地的汇报，及时给予具体的指示，并迅即电告省有关部门从广州起运大批物资器材和拨来六十五万元救济款，支持灾区恢复生产。地委第一书记罗天亲自到普宁、潮阳两县指挥。全区各县和人民公社的大批负责干部，都同广大抗洪大军一起参加抢险。人民解放军空军部队也派出飞机到普宁、潮阳等地空投干粮，支援被水围困的群众。专区和汕头市的工业、交通、邮电、商业等部门，也全力支援抢险斗争。
    在抗洪抢险和排涝抢救农作物的战斗中，再次显示了人民公社无比的优越性。各个公社都统一使用抗灾的人力、物力，互相支援。潮安县在6日一天内，就集中十五万人，挖掘和疏通了八千四百五十七宗排水沟，使全县十七万亩受涝的水旱地全部排干了渍水。
    这次内涝渍水能够迅速排除，所以能迅速制服涝灾，还借助于大跃进以来新修大批排灌蓄水工程所发挥的巨大作用。饶平县黄岗镇附近一带历来易受黄岗河淹浸。今年由于建成了汤溪水库，拦蓄了洪水，这次虽然下雨四百毫米，但下游并没有发生洪涝灾害。潮安县几个公社今春修建的内洋排涝工程，也都发挥了巨大作用，使十多万亩农田的渍水在一天之内就全部排干。
