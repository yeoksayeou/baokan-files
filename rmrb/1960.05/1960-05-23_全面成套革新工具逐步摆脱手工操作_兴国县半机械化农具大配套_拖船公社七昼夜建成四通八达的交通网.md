    Comprehensive and Complete Tool Innovation Gradually Eliminates Manual Labor
    Xingguo County’s Semi-Mechanized Agricultural Implements Achieve Full Support
    Tuochuan Commune Builds a Network of Roads in Seven Days and Nights
    (By our reporter) Xingguo County, Jiangxi Province, has achieved great success in reforming tools in a comprehensive and complete manner.
    Xingguo County's approach to comprehensively reforming tools as a complete set is to focus on "ten machines" and vigorously promote "ten supporting measures" to achieve "five modernizations" throughout the county.
  The "ten machines" are rice transplanters, seeders, weeding machines, harvesters, threshing machines, hulling machines, sweet potato shredders, fodder crushers, rice milling machines, and animal-powered water pumps. The "ten supporting measures" involve equipping each of the following ten production areas with a set of advanced tools: cultivation, sowing, transplanting, field management, water conservancy and irrigation, harvesting and threshing, cafeteria cooking utensils, agricultural and sideline product processing, feeding management, and transportation. The "five modernizations" involve achieving semi-mechanization in the main agricultural production projects, cafeteria cooking, agricultural and sideline product processing, feeding management, and transportation. To achieve the "five modernizations," it is necessary to create and improve more than seventy new tools centered around the "ten machines," so that each of the "ten supporting sets" averages five to seven new tools. In this way, the county will manufacture and promote the use of more than one million various new tools. After realizing the "five modernizations" this year, the county can completely solve the difficulty of labor shortage, allowing the county's farmers to get rid of manual labor in major agricultural production and life aspects.
    Currently, Xingguo County has created and improved more than forty tools centered around the "ten machines," so that each of the "ten supporting sets" averages four advanced tools; more than 400,000 various large and small advanced tools have been manufactured and are being promoted and used in the current spring plowing production. The efficiency of these tools is one to thirty times higher than manual labor. Among the county's twenty communes, three communes have achieved semi-mechanization of major agricultural production projects, five communes have achieved semi-mechanization of cafeteria cooking utensils, ten communes have achieved semi-mechanization of agricultural and sideline product processing, nine communes have achieved semi-mechanization of feeding management, and six communes have achieved semi-mechanization of transportation. The "five modernizations" immediately brought significant results, saving nearly one million workdays in the spring plowing campaign, making spring plowing production faster and better than in previous years.
    In the technical innovation movement, Xingguo County fully utilized the wisdom of the people. Party committees at all levels also established technical innovation committees and leading groups. When commune member Li Zuocheng of Changgang Commune encountered difficulties in creating a threshing machine, the commune party committee mobilized all commune members to help tackle the problem, and after five days of trial production, they finally succeeded in creating it. The Gaoqing Commune Party Committee proposed thirty projects based on the technical innovation plan and organized commune members to innovate, creating and improving more than ten new tools in January. In order to help commune members fundamentally solve the difficulties in technological innovation, various places also universally organized commune members to learn culture and science; counties, communes, and teams extensively organized visits inside and outside the team, and held on-site meetings to learn technology and enlighten thinking.
    Since the beginning of this year, more than 200 commune-run machinery factories and farm tool factories in the county have manufactured more than 50,000 vises, files, hand saws, hand vises, screw plates, etc., and created more than 100 homemade lathes and homemade planers.
  (By our reporter) Tuochuan People's Commune, Jiangxi, built a traffic network in seven days and nights, making the main agricultural production base of the whole commune connected in all directions.
    Large-scale transport in the commune is an important agricultural infrastructure construction to rapidly improve the level of agricultural production and labor productivity, realize a continued great leap forward, and promote agricultural technological transformation. Tuochuan Commune completed this far-reaching major event in only seven days and nights with the dispatch of more than 1,000 laborers. This reasonable layout, comprehensive planning, and complete system of commune traffic network, consisting of a total of 155 roads, a total length of more than 330 li. The great role of this network of trunk and branch roads, which are six feet wide and can drive vehicles and tractors, has been fully demonstrated in this spring's production, and the entire labor cost used in the construction has been recovered many times over. This year, the labor days for early rice fertilization in the whole commune has been reduced from 588,000 to more than 96,000, and the time has been shortened from 70 days to 23 days.
    Building traffic networks to fertilizer accumulation and manufacturing bases in low-yield and high-yield fields is a long-term measure to realize the transformation of low-yield to high-yield and high-yield to higher-yield. The main reason for the formation of more than 18,000 mu of low-yield fields in Tuochuan Commune is that they are too far from the village. Some of the fields are not really far, but because there is no direct field road, it is caused by having to bypass many curved field ridges. Due to the inconvenience of cultivation due to the distance, the yield has remained at around 200 jin for many years. After the large-scale construction of transportation, these low-yield fields have been basically transformed in spring production. Because the fertilizer is transported by vehicles, more than 18,000 mu of low-yield fields in the whole commune have been fertilized with three times more fertilizer in half the time than in the past.
    Establishing transportation in the fields also creates convenient conditions for rushing to harvest and transport. Here, summer harvesting, carrying, cultivating and transplanting are carried out at the same time. In the past, due to inconvenient transportation and tight time, transportation was done by shoulder; if the transportation was not timely, it had to be piled in the field, and coupled with the heavy rainfall at the turn of spring and summer, it often caused losses. After the construction of the field road, it can use nearly 90% less labor and time than carrying on shoulders to transport rice and wheat to the threshing floor in a timely manner. This creates conditions for high yield and bumper harvest.
    Realizing the improvement of agricultural tools, mechanization, and semi-mechanization, and building field roads is an important condition. Due to the lack of field roads for vehicles to pass in the past, the double-wheel double-share plows of each production team were carried to the fields by four people. The three tractors of the commune had even more obstacles to move, and whenever the tractor drove into the fields of the production team, it always concentrated some labor to open a temporary road for the machine. Now the tractor can not only be dispatched throughout the commune, but also because it is not restricted by small roads and many rivers, the fuel consumption is greatly reduced.

    本报讯　江西兴国县成套改革工具，取得了巨大成绩。
    兴国县全面成套改革工具的做法是，以“十机”为中心，大搞
  “十配套”，使全县实现“五化”。
  “十机”是插秧机、播种机、锄草机、收割机、打谷机、脱壳机、刨丝机、饲料粉碎机、碾米机和畜力抽水机，“十配套”是为耕作、播种、插秧、田间管理、水利灌溉、收割脱粒、食堂炊具、农副产品加工、饲养管理和运输等十项生产各配一套先进工具，“五化”是农业生产主要项目、食堂炊事、农副产品加工、饲养管理、运输等五项实现半机械化。要实现“五化”，必须以“十机”为中心创制与改良七十多种新工具，使“十配套”达到平均每套有五种至七种新工具。这样，全县要制造与推广使用各种新工具一百万件以上。今年全县实现“五化”以后，可以完全解决劳力不足的困难，使全县农民在主要农业生产和生活等方面摆脱手工操作。
    现在，兴国县以“十机”为中心，创制、改良了工具四十多种，使“十配套”达到了平均每套有四种先进工具；已制造出各种大小先进工具四十多万件，在当前春耕生产中推广使用。这些工具的工效比手工操作提高一至三十倍。全县二十个公社中，目前有三个公社实现了农业生产主要项目半机械化，五个公社实现了食堂炊具半机械化，十个公社实现了农副产品加工半机械化，九个公社实现了饲养管理半机械化，六个公社实现了运输半机械化。“五化”立即带来了显著成果，在春耕运动中已节省了近百万个劳动日，从而春耕生产比往年搞得既快又好。
    在技术革新运动中，兴国县充分发挥了人民群众的智慧。各级党委还成立了技术革新委员会和领导小组。长岗公社社员李佐程创造打谷机遇到困难，公社党委便发动全社社员帮助攻关，经过五天试制，终于创制成功。高兴公社党委根据技术革新规划提出三十个项目，组织社员革新，1月内创制与改良了十多种新工具。为了帮助社员从根本上解决革新技术中的困难，各地还普遍组织社员学文化、学科学；县、社、队内队外广泛组织参观，开现场会，既学技术，又启发思想。
    今年以来，全县二百多个社办机械厂、农具厂制造了五万多件台钳、锉刀、土锯、手虎钳、螺丝板等，并创制了一百多台土车床、土刨床。
  本报讯　江西拖船人民公社，七昼夜建成了使全社主要农业生产基地形成了四通八达的交通网。
    大办公社交通是迅速提高农业生产水平和劳动生产率、实现继续大跃进、促进农业技术改造的一项重要的农业基本建设。这项意义深远的大事情，拖船公社仅以七昼夜的时间和出动一千多劳力就把它全部完成。这个布局合理、规划全面、体系完整的公社交通网，共一百五十五条道路组成，总长三百三十多华里。这个干、支道脉络相联，宽达六尺，能行车、能走拖拉机的交通道的巨大作用，在今春生产中已经充分发挥出来，兴修中所用的全部劳动代价，已经成倍地收了回来。今年全社早稻一季集肥运肥，劳动日即由五十八万八千个减少到九万六千多个，时间由七十天缩短到二十三天。
    在低产田、高产田广建通往积肥、造肥基地的交通网，是实现低产变高产、高产再高产的长远措施。拖船公社一万八千多亩低产田形成的主要原因是离村太远。有一部分田并不是真的远，而是因为没有直达的田间道，要绕过许多弯曲田塍道而造成的。由于远耕耘不便，产量历年来都停留在二百斤左右。大办交通以后，这些低产田在春季生产中就得到了基本改造，由于送肥车子化，全社一万八千多亩低产田都用比过去少一半的时间施下了多三倍的肥料。
    在田间建立交通，还为抢收抢运创造了方便条件。这里夏季收割、挑运和耕田、插秧都是同时进行的。过去由于交通不便，时间过紧，运输又都是肩挑；挑运不及时，不得不堆在田里，再加春夏之交雨量较多，往往造成损失。田间大道建成后，就可用少于肩挑近90％的劳力、时间，及时地把稻、麦运进打谷场。这就为高产丰收创造了条件。
    实现改良农具化、机械化和半机械化，修筑田间道路是一个重要条件。由于以往没有通行车辆的田间道路，各个生产队的双轮双铧犁，都是四人抬着下田。公社三部拖拉机行动起来障碍更多，每当拖拉机开进生产队田间时，总要集中一些劳动力为机子开出一条临时道，现在拖拉机不仅可以在全社内调度，而且由于不受道路小、河川多等限制，耗油量也就大大减少。
