Hunan Province: Three Million People Support Spring Harvesting and Spring Planting
Hubei Province: Farmers Fight Against Rain to Protect Seedlings

(Reported by this newspaper) More than three million employees from industry, commerce, culture, education, health and other departments in Hunan Province are vigorously supporting the rural areas in the battle to harvest spring crops and transplant early rice.

Hunan Province's spring planting tasks greatly exceeded last year. This year, it is planned to plant 25 million mu of early rice, an increase of 8 million mu over last year; the area of spring-harvested crops increased by 5 million mu compared to last year. In the previous period, the province suffered several cold waves, seedling growth was slow, and the rice transplanting season was generally delayed by a few days. In order to seize the time to complete spring planting and spring harvesting tasks, all departments in the province have formulated plans and actively provided support. The vast number of employees in Zhuzhou City formed nine corps to support the nine people's communes in the vicinity with rice transplanting. More than 1,800 mechanics and carpenters in Changsha City, carrying repair tools, went to the countryside to help the farmer brothers in Changsha County repair rice transplanters while working. The commercial departments organized more than 36,000 cadres to focus on the supply of production materials, and organized more than 20,000 peddlers to deliver goods to the door, ensuring that whatever the rural areas needed was supplied, and supplied wherever it was needed. Medical and health departments organized various mobile medical teams and construction site hospitals to go deep into the rural areas. More than five million teachers and students from large, middle and primary schools throughout the province, with schools or classes as units, ran rice transplanter training classes to enable teachers and students to learn how to use rice transplanters for transplanting.

At present, the farmers in rural areas throughout the province are full of energy, and people from all walks of life in urban and rural areas are vigorously supporting them. A vigorous battle to rush transplant early rice and rush to harvest spring crops is in full swing. As of April 26, the province had transplanted more than 7 million mu of early rice. (Wei Changwang)

(Reported by this newspaper) Yizhang County, Hunan Province, launched a "100,000 Red Banner Rice Transplanters" movement. New people and new things emerged one after another, pushing the high-efficiency and high-quality rice transplanting competition to a new climax. There were 9,000 people in the county who harrowed 10 to 20 mu of land per day, 22,000 people who pulled 150 to 600 jin of seedlings, 20,000 people who transplanted half a mu to two mu of land by hand, and more than 2,700 people who transplanted two mu to six mu by machine. There were 3,120 red banner teams and red banner groups in the county. 75% of the commune members exceeded the labor quota, and the daily transplanting progress increased from 5,000 mu to 25,000 mu.

As of April 23, the county had transplanted 286,000 mu of early rice out of 300,000 mu, completing the transplanting task.

(Reported by this newspaper) In the busy season of rushing to sow early rice seedlings and rush to harvest spring crops, the Hongqi People's Commune in Longhui County, Hunan Province, rationally arranged labor and various farm work, so that each process was closely linked, one link tightly connected to another, so as to achieve simultaneous harvesting, plowing, and transplanting, seize the season to harvest spring crops and transplant early rice well. As of April 23, the commune had transplanted more than 44,500 mu of early rice, accounting for 86% of the planned area; after the 13,000 mu of rapeseed fields were harvested, they were generally plowed and harrowed four times, and most of them were transplanted with early rice seedlings.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan: A battle to resist continuous rain and cold waves to ensure the victory of early rice seedling cultivation is being fiercely waged in Hubei Province.

Hubei Province plans to expand the planting area of early rice this year by a large amount compared to last year. In order to strive for a bumper harvest of early rice, according to past experience, the early rice sowing and seedling cultivation work in most areas was advanced by one solar term compared to last year. However, since the sowing of early rice, that is, since mid-to-late March, there has been continuous rain, frequent cold waves, and the temperature in various places has dropped to around zero degrees Celsius several times. There was a lot of spring rain, many cloudy days, and a long period of low temperatures, which seriously affected the growth of early rice seedlings, and the phenomenon of rotten seedlings was quite common. Under this situation, in order to strive to achieve the early rice expansion plan, party committees at all levels put forward the fighting slogan of "Mobilize the whole party and the whole people, fight against rain and cold to protect seedlings, and ensure that not a single seedling is damaged," and led the vast number of commune members to rely on the superiority of the people's communes, with soaring revolutionary energy, to launch a seedling protection struggle. In order not to cause damage to the seedlings, Yingcheng County in the Wuhan area mobilized more than 30,000 commune members throughout the county. After a day and night of fierce fighting, in addition to adding coverings to more than 17,000 mu of early rice seedling fields throughout the county and erecting wave-prevention ropes, they also built more than 1,500 windbreaks and dug more than 10,000 smoke cellars. In addition, cadres and commune members with a strong sense of responsibility and rich experience in seedling cultivation were selected to organize 217 inspection teams to go deep into the fields, conduct roving inspections, promptly discover and solve problems, and carefully protect the seedlings.

In areas where the phenomenon of rotten seedlings has already occurred, the management of seedling fields is even more refined. Shishou County drained the rust water and sewage from the seedling fields, irrigated them with clean water, used sprayers to wash away the mud, green saliva, and black skin from the seedlings, and generally sprayed Bordeaux mixture and a medicinal liquid made of "666" powder, and continuously applied fertilizer to promote even and strong seedlings, so that the foot seedlings quickly grew up. Jingzhou Prefecture comprehensively promoted this advanced experience, and the withered seedlings quickly turned green, the root hearts sprouted together, and the seedlings could grow about five minutes a day. At the same time, various places also adopted methods such as rapid germination, rapid seedling cultivation, and large-scale direct seeding to make up for the loss of rotten seedlings. Echeng County in the Huanggang area alone plans to directly sow more than 48,000 mu of early rice this year, preserving the early rice area. A small number of areas with particularly severe rotten seedlings have also changed to planting mid-season rice in a timely manner according to local conditions.

    湖南三百万人支援春收春插
    湖北农民奋战阴雨保护秧苗
    本报讯　湖南省各地工、商、文教、卫生等部门职工三百多万人大力支援农村抢收春收作物和抢插早稻的战斗。
    湖南省春种任务大大超过去年。今年计划种植早稻二千五百万亩，比去年扩大八百万亩；春收作物面积比去年增加了五百万亩。前一时期，全省遭受了几次寒潮的侵袭，秧苗生长缓慢，插秧季节普遍推迟了几天。为了抢时间完成春种、春收任务，全省各部门纷纷订出计划，积极支援。株洲市的广大职工，组成了九个兵团，支援附近的九个人民公社插秧。长沙市的一千八百多名机械工和铁木工，携带修理工具下乡，一面劳动一面帮助长沙县的农民兄弟修理插秧机。商业部门组织了三万六千多名干部专抓生产资料供应工作，并组织了二万多副货郎担，送货上门，保证做到农村需要什么，就供应什么；那里需要，在那里供应。医药卫生部门组织了各种巡回医疗队、工地医院，深入农村。全省五百多万大、中、小学校师生，以校或班为单位，开办了插秧机训练班，使师生学会使用插秧机插秧。
    目前，全省农村农民们干劲冲天，城乡各阶层人民大力支援，一场轰轰烈烈的抢插早稻和抢收春收作物的战斗正全面展开。到4月26日止，全省已插了早稻七百多万亩。　（魏昌旺）
    本报讯　湖南省宜章县开展了十万红旗插秧手运动。新人新事层出不穷，把插秧高工效、高质量竞赛推向新高潮。全县日耙田十至二十亩的九千人，扯秧一百五十到六百斤的二万二千人，手插田半亩至二亩的二万人，机插二亩至六亩的二千七百多人。全县出现红旗队、红旗组三千一百二十个，75％的社员都超过劳动定额，日插进度由五千亩上升到二万五千亩。
    到4月23日止，全县三十万亩早稻已插二十八万六千亩，完成了插秧任务。
    本报讯　湖南省隆回县红旗人民公社在抢播早稻秧苗、抢收春收作物的繁忙季节中，合理安排劳动力和各项农活，使各个工序紧密衔接，一环紧套一环，做到边收、边犁、边插，抢住季节收好春收作物和插好早稻。截至4月23日止，全社已插完早稻四万四千五百多亩，占计划面积86％；一万三千亩油菜田，在抢收完毕后普遍犁耙四次，大部分插上了早稻秧苗。
    据新华社武汉讯　一场抗拒阴雨寒潮确保早稻育秧胜利的战斗正在湖北省激烈开展。
    湖北省今年早稻计划种植面积比去年扩大很多。为了争取早稻大丰收，根据历年经验，绝大部分地区的早稻播种、育秧工作，比去年提早了一个节令。但是，从早稻播种起，即从3月中、下旬以来，连绵阴雨，寒潮频繁，各地气温曾数度下降到摄氏零度上下。春雨多，阴天多，低温时间长，严重影响着早稻秧苗的生长，烂秧现象相当普遍。在这种情况下，为了力争实现早稻扩种计划，各级党委提出了“全党全民齐动员，决战雨、寒护秧关，确保一棵苗不损”的战斗口号，领导广大社员以冲天的革命干劲，依靠人民公社的优越性，展开了护秧斗争。武汉地区的应城县为了不使秧苗受到损失，全县出动了三万多名社员，激战一天一夜，除为全县一万七千多亩早稻秧田加了复盖物，牵了防浪绳以外，还搭起了防风障一千五百多个，挖熏烟窖一万多个。此外，又选拔了责任心强、育秧经验丰富的干部、社员，组织了二百一十七个检查组，深入田间，巡回检查，及时发现和解决问题，细致地保护秧苗。
    已经发生烂秧现象的地区，对秧田管理更是精细。石首县排干秧田中的锈水和污水，灌上清水，用喷雾器洗除秧苗上的泥浆、绿涎、黑皮等，普遍喷射波尔多液和“六六六”粉制成的药液，连续追施齐苗壮秧肥，使脚秧迅速生长起来，荆州专区全面地推广了这个先进经验，枯萎的秧苗迅速返青，根心齐发，秧苗一天能长五分左右。和这同时，各地还采取快速催芽、快速育苗以及大搞直播等办法，弥补烂秧损失。仅黄岗地区的鄂城县今年就计划直播早稻四万八千多亩，保住了早稻面积。少数烂秧特别严重的地区，也都因地制宜地及时地改种了中稻。
