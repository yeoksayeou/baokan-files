    People and Rocks
    Jin Ke
    Lin County is entirely situated in the Taihang Mountains, and the main characteristic of the entire county is rock. Underfoot is rock, what you see when you look up is rock, and many houses are built "entirely of stone," even the roof tiles are made of stone slabs several feet long and wide.
    We arrived at the Gaojiatai Brigade of the Shiban'yan Commune. The mountains here are like winter melons standing side by side on the earth, with cliffs thousands of feet high and peaks reaching into the clouds. In the past, people had to carry a load of fresh pears, persimmons, or walnuts from the top of the mountain down to the bottom. Although the distance seemed to be only a few hundred meters, they had to follow the winding mountain path, making hundreds of turns and bends, taking at least half a day to reach the foot of the mountain. In the past, many fruits rotted on the mountain due to untimely transportation. Now, the People's Commune makes use of the steep mountain terrain and has erected steel cable transport lines everywhere, some as thin as a little finger. The short ones are three to five hundred meters long, and the long ones are one thousand to one thousand five hundred meters long. With these, the various fruits produced on the mountain can slide down to the plain like flowing water. Last year, the 240-plus households of the Gaojiatai Brigade produced more than 700,000 jin of pears and walnuts, saving the entire brigade 120,000 workdays from this item alone. More importantly, it saved a large number of fruits from spoilage.
    We arrived at the site of the project to divert the Zhang River into Lin County. The Zhang River is in Shanxi Province, adjacent to Lin County; Lin County lacks water, so the county committee led the commune members to Shanxi Province to bring in a water dragon. On both sides of the Zhang River, the slopes of the Taihang Mountains are as if cut by a knife. The commune members, with ropes tied around their waists and feet on the suspended cliffs, fought against the rocks at a height of one hundred and several tens of meters above the ground. Look! A large stone is being overturned, making a kong-kong-long-long sound as it collides with the mountain rocks along the way, falling to the ground with a "ka—" sound, smashing into powder, and thick smoke rises into the air like the explosion of a heavy bomb in the old days. The thick smoke is not smoke, but stone powder. The "ka—" sound suddenly rises from the ground, crisp and long, and immediately transforms into a sound dragon, circling and swirling in the valley, like a bat trapped in a house, searching for a way out in all directions, echoing for a long time before finding a crack in the sky and escaping into the sky.
    In those slightly sloping places, it is even more spectacular. The stones that the commune members opened from the mountainside rolled down the slope, colliding and making bang-bang-pa-pa sounds along the way. Rolling to a height of tens of meters above the ground, they have become countless gravels. From a distance, they look like thousands of feet of waterfalls, rushing down from the sky. The majestic momentum of the Taihang Mountains pales in comparison to the soaring enthusiasm of the people.
    Under the leadership of the Party, the heroic people of Lin County, using the three magic weapons of winning battles, have turned many "bad things" that caused special poverty in the mountainous areas into "good things," turning "poor mountains" into "rich mountains." They make use of the uneven terrain of the mountainous area to build reservoirs, open up canals, and establish power stations to irrigate farmland; they use the constant wind on the top of the mountain in all seasons to build wind power stations and wind power processing plants; they use the inexhaustible rocks on the mountain to build factories, schools, and stone rails; they use the steep mountain terrain to erect high-altitude transportation lines; they use the rock crevices on the hillside to plant fruit trees; they use the countless oak and mulberry trees on the hillside to raise silkworms, tussah silkworms, and castor silkworms; they use the weeds on the hillside to develop large numbers of cattle, sheep, pigs, and rabbits... The General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes have given full play to the subjective initiative of the people, overcoming the stubborn rocks on the Taihang Mountains, and making the mountainous areas more prosperous and beautiful day by day. Isn't this a microcosm of the life of our country and our nation today!

    人和岩石
    金柯
    林县，整个儿地座落在太行山上，全县的主要特点是岩石。脚下踩的是岩石，抬头望见的是岩石，不少房屋也是“一石到底”，连房顶上的瓦片，也是用几尺长宽的石板构成的。
    我们到了石板岩公社的高家台大队。这里的山，像是一个个并排矗立在大地上的冬瓜，峭壁千丈，山峰入云。就在这个地方，过去，人们要从山顶挑一担鲜梨、柿子或核桃下山来，眼看只是几百米的距离，走起路来，却不得不沿着那曲折蜿蜒的羊肠小道，拐几百个弯儿，抹几百个角，少说也得半天，才能挑到山脚下。过去有不少果品，由于运输不及，就烂掉在山上了。如今，人民公社利用山势陡峭，到处都架起了一根根比小手指头还粗的钢丝运输线，其中短的三五百米，长的一千几百米，有了它，山上出产的各种果品，可以像流水一般，源源不绝地滑落到平地上来。高家台大队二百四十多户，去年共产梨、核桃等七十余万斤，只此一项，全大队就节约了十二万个劳动日。更重要的是，挽救了大批果品的霉烂。
    我们到了引漳入林工地。漳河在山西省，与林县紧邻；林县缺水，县委就领着社员远奔山西省去牵进一条水龙王来。漳河两岸，太行山的坡度好像刀切的一样，社员们就在离地一百数十米的高空，腰系绳索，足蹬悬岩，在和岩石搏斗。你看！一块大石头被掀落下来了，一路上发出了孔孔隆隆的和山岩相撞击的声音，落到地上，“咔——”地一声，砸为粉末，浓烟随即腾空而起，有如昔时重磅炸弹爆炸一样。浓烟非烟，那是石头的粉末。那“咔——”地一声，忽地从平地飞起，清脆而又悠长，它立刻化为一条声音之龙，在山谷间盘来旋去，好像一只被关在屋宇里的蝙蝠，四面探寻出路，发出回音，良久良久，才找到天上的一条缝隙，向天际遁逸而去。
    在那些略有坡度的地方，更是壮观。社员们从山腰里开落下来的石头，沿坡而下，一边滚动，一边撞击，沿途发出砰砰啪啪的声音，滚到离地数十米的高处，已经成为无数碎石，远远望去，犹若千丈瀑布，哗哗哗哗，自天而降。太行山的雄伟气势，在人民的冲天干劲面前，显得黯然失色了。
    英雄的林县人民在党的领导下，运用战无不胜的三大法宝，把过去造成山区特别贫困的许多“坏事”都变成了“好事”，使“穷山”变成了“富山”。他们利用山区高低不平的地势，广修水库，开辟渠道，建立电站，灌溉农田；利用山顶上四季不停的大风，建立风力发电站，风力加工厂；利用山上山下取之不尽、用之不竭的岩石盖工厂、盖学校、修筑石轨道；利用山势陡峭，架设高空运输线；利用山坡上的岩石缝隙，广栽果树；利用山坡上数不尽的栎树、桑树，大饲家蚕、柞蚕、蓖麻蚕；利用山坡上下的荒草，大量地发展了牛羊猪兔群……总路线、大跃进、人民公社充分发挥了人的主观能动作用，战胜了太行山上顽固的岩石，把山区建设得一天比一天更富足，更美丽。这不正是我们国家、我们民族的今天生活的缩影么！
