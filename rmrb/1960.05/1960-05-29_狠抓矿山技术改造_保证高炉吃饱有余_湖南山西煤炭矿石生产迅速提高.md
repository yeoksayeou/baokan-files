Xinhua News Agency, Changsha Dispatch: Mine enterprise workers in Hunan Province are adopting a method of simultaneously grasping mining, tunneling, transportation, conservation, and comprehensive utilization to vigorously engage in technical innovation and revolution, accelerating the technical transformation of mines. More than 60,000 miners in the province's coal and iron mines have been liberated from heavy manual labor, which has greatly promoted the sustained leap forward in production. In April, the province's coal production exceeded the monthly plan by 5%, an increase of 60% over the same period last year. Ore production not only guaranteed the current needs of blast furnaces but also had nearly two months of reserves. This fundamentally reversed the usual decline in mining production in Hunan Province during the rainy season.

During the process of technical transformation of mines, Party committees at all levels in the province strengthened specific leadership over this work. They first focused on the three weak links of mining, tunneling, and transportation, where labor was intensive and efficiency was low. According to statistics from the province's iron ore departments, workers put forward more than 64,000 innovation proposals around the three links of mining, tunneling, and transportation, created and promoted 320 sets of various mining and tunneling machines, built more than 20,000 meters of cableways and 108 kilometers of earthen railways, and made many earthen winches and earthen trains. Among the 25 key iron mines in the province, 10 have completely eliminated manual drilling, achieving mechanization and semi-mechanization of mining and tunneling; 21 have basically achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization of transportation. Among the 154 county-level and above coal mines in the province, 84 had promoted advanced coal mining methods such as horizontal slicing and longwall mining by the end of April.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan Dispatch: Workers in the Shanxi Province mining system are enthusiastically carrying out a mine technical transformation competition movement with the goal of learning from Liangjiageta, catching up with Liangjiageta, and surpassing Liangjiageta, striving to increase ore production and ensure a leap forward in steel production. Since the launch of the movement, the province's daily ore production has rapidly increased by 50% compared to the past.

Liangjiageta Mine is a small iron mine in Jiexiu County. This iron mine adopted a self-reliant approach to transform the mine, building a 1,500-meter-long winding mountain railway in 15 days, and converting the entire mine from manual drilling to mechanical mining in one month. Manpower was replaced by cableways and wooden rail transportation. Daily ore production increased sharply from 200 tons to 600 tons, while the number of workers decreased by 193. The cost per ton of ore decreased from 15 yuan to 5 yuan. The Shanxi Provincial Party Committee seized this typical example and called on iron mine workers throughout the province to universally carry out a mine technical transformation competition movement, requiring that by the end of June, 35 iron mines in the province reach the level of Liangjiageta Mine—with output increasing by one to three times.

After the iron mine workers in various places had clear goals and specific examples, their confidence increased greatly, and they immediately launched a mass movement to learn from Liangjiageta Mine. As of May 21, 71 mining areas in the province had undergone comprehensive technical transformation, and 29 mining areas and 4 mines had reached the level of Liangjiageta.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan Dispatch: The 116 small coal mines in Shanxi Province have comprehensively carried out technical transformation, with production capacity more than doubling and costs greatly reduced, while also reducing a large number of laborers.

These small mines, which are located throughout Shanxi, began to undergo comprehensive technical transformation at the beginning of this year. After more than four months of effort, these mines have generally achieved mechanized hoisting, car-based transportation, and drilling and blasting for coal mining. The total annual production capacity of each mine has increased by 1.56 times compared to before the transformation, and labor efficiency has increased from 0.5 tons of coal per person per day to about one ton. With the improvement of coal mining efficiency, the cost of raw coal in small coal mines in various places has generally decreased. The cost of raw coal per ton in Maozequ Coal Mine in Jishan County has dropped from 4.3 yuan to 3.6 yuan; the cost per ton of coal in Zhaowu Coal Mine in Jin Southeast Prefecture has been reduced to 2.26 yuan. The result of comprehensive technical transformation has also enabled small coal mines in various places to reduce a large number of laborers. According to recent statistics, these small mines have saved more than 2,800 laborers.

### 狠抓矿山技术改造　保证高炉吃饱有余  湖南山西煤炭矿石生产迅速提高

    狠抓矿山技术改造　保证高炉吃饱有余
    湖南山西煤炭矿石生产迅速提高
    据新华社长沙电　湖南省矿山企业职工采取采矿、掘进、运输、节约、综合利用五个方面一齐抓的方法，大闹技术革新和技术革命，加速矿山技术改造。全省煤矿、铁矿，已有六万多名矿工从笨重体力劳动中解放出来，并且大大促进了生产的持续跃进。4月份全省煤炭生产超额5％完成了月计划，比去年同期增长60％；矿石生产不仅保证了当前高炉的需要，而且还有了将近两个月的储备量。这样就从根本上扭转了湖南省矿山工业生产雨季减产的常规。
    在矿山技术改造过程中，全省各级党委都对这一工作加强了具体领导。首先从用人多、工效低的采矿、掘进、运输等三个薄弱环节入手。据全省铁矿部门的统计，职工们围绕采、掘、运三个环节，共提出革新建议六万四千多条，创造和推广各种采掘机具三百二十多台，新建两万多米长索道和一百零八公里土铁路，制成了许多土绞车和土火车。全省二十五个重点铁矿中，已有十个铁矿全部消灭手锤打眼，实现了采掘机械化和半机械化；有二十一个铁矿基本上实现了运输机械化和半机械化。全省一百五十四个县属以上的煤矿中，到4月份止已有八十四个推广了水平分层、长壁式等先进采煤方法。
    据新华社太原电　山西省矿山系统职工，正在热烈开展以学梁家圪塔、赶梁家圪塔、超梁家圪塔为目标的矿山技术改造竞赛运动，努力增产矿石，保证钢铁生产跃进。运动开展以来，全省的矿石日产量已比过去迅速提高50％。
    梁家圪塔矿是介休县的一个小铁矿。这个铁矿采取自力更生的办法改造矿山，十五天就修成了一条长一千五百米的盘山铁道，一个月就把全矿手工打眼改成了机械采矿，人推人抬改为用索道、木轨道运。矿石日产量由二百吨猛增到六百吨，而职工却减少了一百九十三人。每吨矿石的成本由十五元降低到五元。中共山西省委抓住这一典型，号召全省铁矿职工普遍开展矿山技术改造竞赛运动，要求到6月底，全省有三十五个铁矿达到梁家圪塔矿的水平，——产量增长一倍到三倍。
    各地铁矿职工有了明确目标和具体榜样以后，信心倍增，立即开展了学习梁家圪塔矿的群众运动。到5月21日止，全省已有七十一个矿区进行了全面的技术改造，二十九个矿区和四个矿达到了梁家圪塔的水平。
    据新华社太原电　山西省一百一十六个小型煤矿全面进行技术改造，生产能力比过去猛增一倍半，成本大大下降，并且减少了大批劳动力。
    这些遍布山西各地的小型矿井，是在今年年初开始进行全面技术改造的。经过四个多月的努力，这些矿井已普遍实现了提升机械化、运输车子化、采煤打眼爆破化。各矿井年产总能力比改造前提高一点五六倍，劳动效率由过去的每人每天采零点五吨煤提高到一吨左右。随着采煤效率的提高，各地小煤矿的原煤成本普遍下降。稷山县毛则渠煤矿每吨原煤成本，已由过去的四点三元下降为三点六元；晋东南专区的赵屋煤矿，每吨煤的成本降低到二点二六元。全面技术改造的结果，也使各地小型煤矿减少了大批劳动力。据最近统计，这些小型矿井已节约出劳动力二千八百多人。
