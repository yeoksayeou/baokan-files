Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 9th. Eight hundred and six Indonesian Overseas Chinese returning home aboard the "Meishangmei" arrived at Huangpu Port on the 8th.

	Most of these Overseas Chinese are small vendors, workers, and Overseas Chinese students returning to China for further education from areas such as Bandung, Cirebon, Tjamis, Garut, and Jakarta. They were originally scheduled to board the ship on April 29th, but due to the Indonesian authorities' sudden change in baggage inspection procedures, deliberately creating difficulties, they did not board the ship until May 1st to return home. The Overseas Chinese returning from Cirebon had completed all the procedures for returning to China before the Spring Festival this year, but the local authorities deliberately delayed their departure for more than three months, leaving these Overseas Chinese destitute during this period and forced to rely on borrowing and selling clothes to survive. When inspecting the baggage, the Indonesian authorities also wantonly damaged the Overseas Chinese's personal radios, thermos bottles, and suitcases, and detained clothing, ornaments, and souvenirs.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 7th. Over six hundred Indonesian Overseas Chinese returned to Zhanjiang Port aboard the "Hai Huang" on the morning of the 6th, and were warmly welcomed by Che Jinming, Deputy Commissioner of the Zhanjiang Commissioner's Office, the heads of the Zhanjiang Special Zone's reception and resettlement departments for returned Overseas Chinese, and people from all walks of life. This group of returned Overseas Chinese came from the Samarinda area of Indonesia, and most of them are workers, farmers, small vendors, and students. They were very excited to return to the embrace of the motherland, and many expressed their gratitude to the motherland's government and people for their care for Overseas Chinese, while also exposing the Indonesian authorities' various obstructions and harassments of their return home. Returned Overseas Chinese Lu Yaoda said that after consultation between Jiang Yan, our consul in Marachen, and the Samarinda authorities, it was originally decided to complete all departure procedures for this group of returning Overseas Chinese at 4:00 pm on April 27th. However, the Samarinda authorities deliberately delayed the time, and each procedure required a long wait, and they also held down our hands and forced us to put one hundred fingerprints on five forms. Every Overseas Chinese person over the age of sixteen had to undergo individual questioning by the police station and the prosecutor's office, and many of the questions asked were repetitive. Obviously, this could not complete the procedures at the scheduled time. The Overseas Chinese stayed and waited, requesting that the procedures continue to be processed, but they stopped working and even sent armed military police with live ammunition to treat us. They also restricted the heads of Overseas Chinese organizations from coming out to serve the Overseas Chinese and did not allow us to see the consul. Lu Yaoda said that Consul Jiang Yan had always adopted a cooperative attitude towards the Samarinda authorities. Although the Samarinda authorities refused to complete the procedures that could have been completed on time, Consul Jiang Yan still sincerely and friendly expressed the hope that they would continue to process them, but they were unreasonably rejected and treated the Overseas Chinese and Consul Jiang Yan with an extremely unfriendly attitude. Lu Yaoda said that due to the obstruction and harassment of the Samarinda authorities, we did not complete all the procedures and board the ship to return home until the morning of April 29th.

	After the returned Overseas Chinese landed, they took special buses to the Overseas Chinese Guesthouse to rest. They will be properly resettled in the Zhanjiang Special Zone.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhanjiang, 8th. The ship "Hai Huang," dispatched by the Chinese government to transport Overseas Chinese back to China, set sail from Zhanjiang Port at 10:00 am today for its fifth trip to Indonesia.

    又有一千多名华侨回到祖国
    很多归侨揭露印度尼西亚有关当局的留难阻挠行为 
    我国派出接侨船只“海皇”号第五次开往印度尼西亚
    新华社广州9日电　乘“美上美”号轮船回国的八百零六名印度尼西亚华侨，8日到达黄埔港。
    这批华侨大部分是万隆、加于横、尖美士、牙律、雅克达等地的小商贩、工人和回国升学的华侨学生。他们原定4月29日上船，由于印度尼西亚有关当局突然改变检查行李的手续，有意留难，到5月1日他们才上船回国。从加于横回国的华侨，今年春节前已办妥回国的一切手续，但当地有关当局却故意拖延了三个多月方批准他们离境，使这批华侨在这期间生活无着，不得不靠借贷、卖衣物来维持生活。印度尼西亚有关当局在检查行李时，还肆意破坏这批华侨携带自用的收音机、热水瓶、皮箱，扣留衣物、装饰品和纪念品。
    新华社广州7日电　六百多名印度尼西亚华侨6日上午乘“海皇”号轮船回到湛江港，受到湛江专员公署副专员车金铭、湛江专区接待和安置归国华侨部门负责人和各界人民的热烈欢迎。这批归侨是从印度尼西亚三马林达地区回国的，大多数是工人、农民、小商贩和学生。他们回到祖国怀抱都非常兴奋，许多人表示感激祖国政府和人民对海外华侨的关怀，同时揭露了印度尼西亚有关当局多方阻挠、刁难他们回国的经过。归侨卢耀达说，经我国驻马辰领事江燕同三马林达当局协商同意，原来决定在4月27日下午四时办完这批回国华侨一切离境手续。但是，三马林达当局却有意拖延时间，每道手续都要等候很长时间，还要按住我们的手，强迫我们在五张表上打一百个手指印。每一个十六岁以上的华侨，都要经过警察局和检察署的个别询问，所问的话很多是重复的。这样显然不能按预定时间办完手续。侨胞们留下等候，要求继续办理手续，他们却停止办公，还派荷枪实弹的武装军警对待我们。并且限制华侨团体负责人出来为侨胞们服务，又不准我们见领事。卢耀达说，江燕领事对三马林达当局，一直是采取合作的态度。虽然三马林达当局不肯按时办完本来可以办完的手续，江燕领事仍然诚恳友好地表示希望他们继续办理，但是遭到他们无理拒绝，并且用极不友好的态度来对待华侨和江燕领事。卢耀达说，由于三马林达当局的阻挠、刁难，我们一直到4月29日上午才全部办完手续，登船回国。
    归侨们上岸后，乘专车到华侨招待所休息。他们将在湛江专区得到妥善安置。
    新华社湛江8日电　中国政府派出接运华侨回国的船只“海皇”号，今天上午十时由湛江港启航第五次开往印度尼西亚。
