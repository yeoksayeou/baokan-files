Xinhua News Agency, May 27th: Ankara News: The Turkish army launched a coup this morning and overthrew the traitorous Menderes government.

According to an Associated Press report, Ankara Radio announced that the Turkish army has taken over the military and civil administration of the country. Ankara Radio has obviously also been controlled by the army.

Ankara Radio also announced that Turkish President Bayar and members of the Menderes cabinet have been taken into custody by the army. However, it did not specify whether Menderes himself, who was on a "stabilizing the people's hearts" trip to Anatolia, has also been arrested.

Ankara Radio announced that the army will remain in power until new general elections are held. It is reported that no bloodshed has occurred so far.

The radio station broadcast that Turkey will remain within the aggressive NATO and CENTO military blocs.

After four weeks of mass demonstrations against the reactionary Menderes regime, the ruling Democratic Party brazenly forced the National Assembly to adjourn the day before yesterday with a majority vote.

Xinhua News Agency, May 27th: Ankara News: After the Turkish army launched a coup today and took over the government, it issued a communique announcing the implementation of military rule throughout the country and the establishment of a "National Unity Committee."

According to a communique broadcast by Ankara Radio in the name of the "National Unity Committee," the Turkish army took over the government in order to "free the parties from the irreconcilable situation they have fallen into," so that elections "can be held as soon as possible under the supervision and arbitration of a non-partisan and fair government, in order to transfer the government to any party that wins the election."

The communique said that the new regime is "loyal" to all of Turkey's alliances and obligations, and it "believes in" and is "loyal" to the aggressive "North Atlantic Treaty Organization" and "Central Treaty Organization."

In another communique, the "National Unity Committee" said that all political parties must cease activities, the party organs’ publications must cease publication, and all gatherings are prohibited until new orders are issued. The communique called on the people not to take to the streets.

It is reported that Prime Minister Menderes and his Minister of Finance were arrested by the army in Kutahya and have been escorted to the capital, Ankara. Also in the custody of the army are the Turkish President, the Speaker of the National Assembly, the Minister of Defense, the Minister of Interior, the Commander of the Turkish Ground Forces, other ministers, and the governors of the provinces.

According to Agence France-Presse, General Gursel, the Commander of the Turkish Ground Forces who resigned in early May due to dissatisfaction with the Menderes government, has been appointed as the leader of the "National Unity Committee," and he also commands the Turkish armed forces.

    又一个美国走狗倒台
    土耳其陆军发动政变推翻曼德列斯政府
    新华社27日讯　安卡拉消息：土耳其陆军在今天清晨发动政变，推翻了卖国的曼德列斯政府。
    据美联社报道，安卡拉电台宣布，土耳其军队已经接管了全国的军事和民政管理权。安卡拉电台显然也已被陆军所控制。
    安卡拉电台还宣布土耳其总统拜亚尔和曼德列斯内阁的阁员已被陆军看管起来。但是，没有说明正在安托利亚作“稳定人心”旅行的曼德列斯本人是否也已被捕。
    安卡拉电台宣布，在新的大选举行之前，陆军将继续掌权。据报道，到目前为止，还没有发生任何流血事件。
    这家电台广播说，土耳其将仍然留在侵略性的北大西洋公约组织和中央条约组织军事集团以内。
    经过四个星期的反对曼德列斯反动政权的群众性示威以后，执政的民主党在前天以多数票悍然强迫国民议会休会。
    新华社27日讯　安卡拉消息：土耳其军队在今天发动政变，接管政权之后，发表公报宣布在全国实行军事统治，并成立“全国团结委员会”。
    据安卡拉电台所广播的以“全国团结委员会”的名义所发表的公报说，土耳其军队所以接管政权是为了“使党派摆脱它们所陷入的不可调和的局面”，使选举“能够在一个超党派的和公正的政府监督和仲裁下尽速举行，以便把政府移交给在选举中获胜的任何党派。”
    公报说，新政权“忠于”土耳其所有的联盟和义务，它“相信”和“忠于”侵略性的“北大西洋公约组织”和“中央条约组织”。
    “全国团结委员会”在另一个公报中说，在新的命令发布之前，所有政党一律停止活动，各政党的机关刊物停止出版，禁止一切集会。公报要求人民不要上街。
    据报道，曼德列斯总理和他的财政部长一起在库塔耶城被军队逮捕并已押到首都安卡拉。被军队看管的还有土耳其总统、国民议会议长、国防部长、内政部长、土耳其地面部队司令、其他部长和各省省长。
    据法新社报道，由于不满曼德列斯政府而在5月初辞职的土耳其地面部队司令古尔塞勒已被任命为“全国团结委员会”的领导人，土耳其的武装部队也由他指挥。
