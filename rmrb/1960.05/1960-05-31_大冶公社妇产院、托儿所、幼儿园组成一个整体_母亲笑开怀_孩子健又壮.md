    Daye Commune Maternity Hospital, Nursery, and Kindergarten Form an Integrated Whole
    Mothers Smile Broadly, Children are Healthy and Strong
    (Our Dispatch) Reporter Chen Jian reports: A new type of maternal and child healthcare organization – "Mother and Child Happy Paradise" – has appeared in Daye People's Commune, Dengfeng County, Henan Province. It satisfies all the mothers in the commune and makes children healthy, and it is praised as the "Gospel of Mothers and Children."
    All five management areas of Daye People's Commune have such organizations as "Mother and Child Happy Paradise." The commune's is relatively large in scale and fully equipped. It has six departments, including an outpatient department, maternity department, infant department, and maternal and child health propaganda department, and 23 rooms such as examination rooms, delivery rooms, and breastfeeding rooms. The maternal and child health stations in each brigade are also responsible for outpatient services, receiving maternity patients, and taking care of young children. The commune's "Mother and Child Happy Paradise" is mainly responsible for leading the maternal and child healthcare organizations and childcare organizations in each management area and production team. Pregnant women with difficult labor, seriously ill young children, and children with particularly weak constitutions in each management area and brigade can all be sent to the commune's "Mother and Child Happy Paradise." In this commune, a female commune member, from the time she becomes pregnant until her child is born and reaches school age, is entirely taken care of by the "Mother and Child Happy Paradise" at all levels, and she does not have to worry at all. All of the more than six thousand mothers with children in the commune are completely freed from the constraints of their children. The survival rate of newborns is 100%.
    The maternity department in "Mother and Child Happy Paradise" takes good care of both mothers and babies. Ten days before a pregnant woman's expected date of delivery, the outpatient department transfers her prenatal examination form to the maternity department, and the pregnant woman can live in the waiting room of the maternity department. Before delivery, she only does some very light needlework and the comrades of the Maternal and Child Health Propaganda Department give her health knowledge. The mother can eat and live quietly in the maternity room for 45 days, and receive special care in her life. When the mother leaves the garden, the baby stays in the breastfeeding room.
    The childcare department is the largest department in "Mother and Child Happy Paradise," and it consists of three main parts: the infant breastfeeding room, the nursery, and the kindergarten: Breastfeeding infants under nine months of age are in the breastfeeding room, children from nine months to three years old are in the nursery, and children from three years old to school age are in the kindergarten. All of the commune's more than seven thousand three hundred infants and young children have been admitted.
    Infants and young children receive meticulous care in the childcare department. In addition to being fed by their mothers three times a day at regular intervals in the morning, evening, and noon, the breastfeeding room also adds fresh goat's milk and boiled water at 10:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. For children in the nursery, in addition to three meals a day, they also add a snack of homemade biscuits, baked steamed bun slices, mung bean soup, etc.; for children who are particularly weak when they enter the nursery, the childcare department organizes them into special classes and gives them special care in terms of diet and care. The commune itself raises hundreds of dairy goats, and there are also tofu workshops and sugar factories, which can supply goat's milk, tofu pulp, sugar, etc. according to the needs of the children. The children have all developed the habit of eating milk, eating, drinking water, sleeping, and even defecating at regular times. The outpatient department conducts health checkups for infants and young children every month. The more than 220 simple bathrooms built by the brigades themselves give the children a bath every half month, and in summer they bathe every day. The milk bottles used by infants in the breastfeeding room are disinfected every day.
    Children grow up in such a regular environment, and their weight increases significantly. According to a recent survey by the childcare department of the entire commune, the average weight of children increases by two and a half pounds per month. In the "special class" for weak children in Daye Town, the average weight of the 22 young children has increased by three and a half pounds per month in recent months, becoming healthy children. Children here rarely get sick. Several serious flu epidemics have not spread to the childcare department.
    The staff of the "Mother and Child Happy Paradise" and health stations throughout the commune have also launched a "one person兼几员" movement, from the director to the cleaner, they all clean the environment together every day. Doctors have to兼护士 and nutritionists, and teachers can give children haircuts, mend clothes, cook, and clean. The cooks at the health stations of each brigade have to兼会计, child care workers, and also take care of mothers. The personnel of the "Mother and Child Happy Paradise" and the Maternal and Child Health Propaganda Department have to go deep into the villages to do health propaganda work, and also act as midwives, and can deal with general children's diseases.
    Daye People's Commune has already gained many experiences in maternal and child healthcare and childcare work. First of all, the commune party committee attaches great importance to this work. After the people's commune was established, under the leadership of the party committee, more than 20 training classes for maternal and child healthcare and childcare workers were held, each time solving the ideological and business problems of the workers in a certain period. The training classes were held in the commune's "Mother and Child Happy Paradise," and the political lessons were personally taught by Zhou Bingtan, the first secretary of the party committee. Therefore, the political thought and business level of the maternal and child care workers in this commune have improved rapidly. Many teachers have now reached the level of nurses. Secondly, childcare workers often work with parents to jointly implement the policy of running childcare undertakings diligently and thriftily. All of the commune's six thousand toys were made by parents donating materials and childcare workers making them. The houses where the children live are also mostly surplus houses voluntarily vacated by parents, which are cleaned and beautiful after being brushed with lime water by childcare workers and covered with white paper ceilings. Third, each "Mother and Child Happy Paradise" pays attention to strengthening the close contact between parents and childcare workers through various means. Each brigade holds a mom and auntie symposium or heart-to-heart meeting every Sunday. At such meetings, let the older children report their living conditions and health conditions to their mothers, the aunts patiently solicit the opinions of the mothers, and the mothers also report their production conditions to all the personnel of the childcare department. Encourage each other and move forward together. Propose competitive conditions to each other. At present, the competitive conditions put forward by the childcare workers of the entire commune to the female commune members are: "Aunties compete with mothers," and the conditions of the mothers are "Strive for a great harvest of wheat."

    大冶公社妇产院、托儿所、幼儿园组成一个整体
    母亲笑开怀　孩子健又壮
    本报讯　记者陈健报道：一个新型的妇幼保健组织——“母子康福乐园”，出现在河南省登封县大冶人民公社，它使全社的母亲满意，孩子健康，被人称颂为“母子福音”。
    大冶人民公社五个管理区都设有“母子康福乐园”这样的组织。公社的一个规模比较大，设备也比较全。有门诊部、妇产部、幼儿部、妇幼卫生宣传部等六个部和检查室、临产室、哺乳室等二十三个室。各大队设有妇幼保健站，也负责门诊、接收产妇、收托幼儿等。公社的“母子康福乐园”主要负责领导各管理区、各生产队的妇幼保健组织和幼儿组织。各管理区和大队有难产的产妇，重病的幼儿及体质特别弱的孩子都可以送到公社“母子康福乐园”。在这个公社里，一个女社员从怀孕直到把孩子生下来长到入学年龄为止，全部由各级“母子康福乐园”负责，她不用操一点心。全公社有六千多个有孩子的妈妈，完全摆脱了孩子的羁绊。新生婴儿成活率100％。
    “母子康福乐园”中的妇产部，对产妇、婴儿都照顾得很好。孕妇离预产期还有十天，门诊部就把她的产前检查表转到妇产部，孕妇就可以住在妇产部的待产室。她在临产前只做些极轻便的针线，并由妇幼保健宣传部的同志给她讲卫生知识。产妇能在妇产室安静地食宿四十五天，生活上得到特别的照顾。产妇出园时，婴儿就留在哺乳室。
    幼托部是“母子康福乐园”中的最大的一个部，它由婴儿哺乳室、托儿所、幼儿园等三个主要部分组成：九个月以内的吃奶婴儿都在哺乳室，九个月至三周岁在托儿所，三周岁至入学年龄在幼儿园。全公社七千三百多名婴儿、幼儿都已入托。
    婴儿和幼儿在幼托部得到无微不至的照顾。婴儿除每天早、晚和中午定时由妈妈喂奶三次外，哺乳室还在上午十时和下午三时给他们加添鲜羊奶和白开水。托儿所的孩子每天除三餐外，中间还加一顿自制的饼干、烤馍片、绿豆汤等点心；对入托时体质特别弱的孩子，幼托部把他们编成特别班，在饮食上和护理上加以特别照顾。公社自己喂了几百头奶羊，还有豆腐坊、糖厂等，可以根据孩子的需要供给羊奶、豆腐浆、糖等。孩子们都养成定时吃奶、吃饭、喝水、睡觉甚至于大小便的习惯。门诊部每月为婴儿和幼儿作健康检查。各大队自修的二百二十多个简易浴室，每半月给孩子洗一次澡，夏天每天都洗澡。哺乳室婴儿用的奶瓶，每天消毒。
    孩子们在这样有规律的环境里成长，体重都有显著增加。据最近全公社幼托部的调查，孩子体重平均每月增加二斤半，大冶镇体质弱的“特别班”的二十二个幼儿，最近几个月，平均每人每月体重增加三斤半，成了健康的孩子。这里的孩子很少生病，好几次严重的流行感冒，都没有传到幼托部里来。
    全公社“母子康福乐园”及保健站的工作人员，还开展了“一员兼几员”运动，上至主任下至清洁员，每天都一齐打扫环境卫生，医生要兼护士和营养员，教养员会给孩子理发、缝补衣服、做饭、打扫卫生等。各大队保健站的炊事员，要兼会计、保育员，还要护理产妇。“母子康福乐园”、妇幼保健宣传部的人员，既要深入各村做卫生宣传工作，又要当接生员，并能处理一般幼儿疾病。
    大冶人民公社在妇幼保健和幼托工作上已经取得许多经验。首先公社党委非常重视这一工作。人民公社化以后，在党委领导下，就办过二十多次妇幼保健和幼托工作人员训练班，每一次都是解决一个时期工作人员的思想问题和业务问题。训练班设在公社的“母子康福乐园”内，政治课由党委第一书记周炳坦亲自担任。因此，这个公社的妇幼保教工作人员政治思想和业务水平提高的很快，有不少教养员，现在已达到护士水平。其次，保教人员经常和家长一起，共同贯彻勤俭办幼儿事业的方针。全公社有六千件玩具都是由家长献料，保教人员制作的。孩子们住的房子，也多是家长自愿腾出的多余房屋，由保教人员用石灰水刷过，屋顶糊有白纸顶棚，干净而且漂亮。第三，各个“母子康福乐园”注意通过各种方式，加强家长和保教人员之间的密切联系。各大队在每星期日开一次妈妈、阿姨座谈会或谈心会，在这样的会上，让大孩子们向妈妈报告生活情况和健康情况，阿姨们耐心征求妈妈的意见，妈妈们也向幼托部的全体人员报告她们生产的情况。互相鼓励，共同前进。互相提出竞赛条件。当前全公社的保教人员向女社员提出的竞赛条件是：“阿姨赛妈妈”，妈妈们的条件是“夺取小麦大丰收”。（附图片）
