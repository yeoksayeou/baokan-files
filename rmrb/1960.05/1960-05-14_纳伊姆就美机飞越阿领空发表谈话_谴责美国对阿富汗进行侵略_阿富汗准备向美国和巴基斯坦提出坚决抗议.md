Xinhua News Agency, Kabul, May 11th: Afghanistan's Second Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Mohammad Naim, told TASS reporters on May 11th regarding the American plane flying over Afghan airspace and intruding into Soviet territory, that the Afghan government, after studying the American aggression against the Soviet Union and the Kingdom of Afghanistan, is preparing to lodge a strong protest with the US government and the Pakistani government.

Naim said that it has now been confirmed that the United States committed aggression against the Soviet Union. This American behavior does not conform to any international regulations, nor does it help to ease international tensions.

Naim said that just as people all over the world were expecting the summit meeting of the four major powers to achieve good results, the American act of aggression has made relations between countries even more tense, and this behavior contains the danger of a new war breaking out.

Naim said that it is difficult to regard an aircraft equipped with espionage devices and cameras as a civil aircraft.

Speaking of those countries that provide their territory for provocative acts of aggression against other countries, Naim said: We condemn any act of aggression, and we also condemn any country that supports such acts. Naim said that a country that provides its territory for such acts of aggression is itself an accomplice in the act of aggression.

    纳伊姆就美机飞越阿领空发表谈话
    谴责美国对阿富汗进行侵略
    阿富汗准备向美国和巴基斯坦提出坚决抗议
    新华社12日讯　据塔斯社喀布尔11日讯：阿富汗王国第二副首相、外交大臣穆罕默德·纳伊姆11日就美国飞机飞过阿富汗领空侵入苏联国境对塔斯社记者发表谈话说，阿富汗政府在研究美国方面对苏联以及阿富汗王国进行侵略行动之后，正准备向美国政府和巴基斯坦政府提出坚决的抗议。
    纳伊姆说，现已查明，美国对苏联进行了侵略。美国的这种行为不符合任何国际法规，也不能有助于国际紧张局势的缓和。
    纳伊姆说，正当全世界人民期望着四大国政府首脑会议取得良好结果的时候，美国的侵略行为使各国之间的关系更加紧张，而且这种行为蕴藏着爆发新战争的危险。
    纳伊姆说，把装有间谍装置和摄影仪器的飞机当做民用飞机，这是困难的。
    在谈到那些提供本国领土来进行反对其他国家的挑衅性侵略活动的国家时，纳伊姆说：我们谴责任何侵略行为，也谴责支持进行这种行为的任何国家。纳伊姆说，提供自己的领土作为进行这种侵略行为的国家本身也就是侵略行为的同谋者。
