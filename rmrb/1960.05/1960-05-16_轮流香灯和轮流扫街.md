Rotating Incense and Rotating Street Sweeping
Jiangxi Guixi Tianhuashan Reclamation Farm, Tong Jinsheng

Foshan, the nationally renowned sanitary red banner city, used to be a rather superstitious and extremely dirty city. In the Shengping Alley of the city, there was a sign that had been hanging since the tenth year of Guangxu, which read "Rotating incense lighting, repeating endlessly." Even until the vigorous sanitation campaign, some old ladies still took turns burning incense and worshiping Buddha according to the order of the names on the sign, hoping that the gods and Buddhas would spare them from disease and epidemics. The reality was quite the opposite; the disease and epidemics in this alley did not decrease because of their burning incense. It was only after sanitation was improved and science was believed that diseases and epidemics disappeared. Thus, those old ladies awakened and consciously replaced the "Rotating Incense Lighting" sign with a "Rotating Street Sweeping" sign.

The replacement of a "Rotating Incense Lighting" sign with a "Rotating Street Sweeping" sign may seem like a very ordinary thing, but from this point of view, it fully reflects the change in people's mental outlook. People no longer believe in "incense lighting" but believe in "street sweeping." This means that people have broken away from superstition and believe in science, and their world view has also changed. From believing in the power of gods to believing in the power of people. For those elderly people, this can be considered a tremendous change. A conscious, clean, and hygienic civilized style has gradually formed.

The "Rotating Incense Lighting" sign and the "Rotating Street Sweeping" sign not only illustrate the change in people's mental outlook and the improvement of cultural and scientific knowledge, but more importantly, they are also a microcosm of the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, transforming from a "poor and blank" backward state to a prosperous and strong, civilized and thriving socialist country with lofty social customs.

    轮流香灯和轮流扫街
    江西贵溪天华山垦殖场　童金生
    全国闻名的卫生红旗市佛山，过去是一个相当迷信而又非常肮脏的城市。市内升平巷有一块从光绪十年挂起的“轮流香灯，周而复始”的牌子，甚至到大搞卫生运动以前，还有些老太太按照牌上名字的顺序轮流烧香拜佛，指望神佛爷免去她们的病疫。事实恰恰相反，这条巷子的病疫并没有因他们烧香而减少。倒是搞好了卫生，相信了科学以后，才见病疫绝迹，于是，那些老太太们觉醒了，自觉地将“轮流香灯”换上了“轮流扫街”的牌子。
    由一块“轮流香灯”的牌子换上一块“轮流扫街”的牌子，似乎是很平常的事情，但是，从这一点上来看，却充分地反映出人们精神面貌的改观。人们不信“香灯”，而相信“扫街”了。这是说人们破除了迷信，相信科学了，随着他们的世界观也就改变了。从相信神仙的力量，改变为相信人的力量。对于那些老年人来说，这可算是一个天翻地复的大变化。一个自觉的爱清洁、讲卫生的文明作风也就逐渐形成。
    “轮流香灯”牌和“轮流扫街”牌，不仅说明了人们精神面貌的改观，文化科学知识的提高；而且，更重要的，它正是中国人民在党和毛主席的领导下，由“一穷二白”的落后面貌，改变为繁荣富强，文明兴昌，具有崇高的社会风尚的社会主义国家的缩影。
