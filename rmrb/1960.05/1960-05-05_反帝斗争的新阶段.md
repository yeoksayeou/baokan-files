Title: A New Stage in the Anti-Imperialist Struggle

A volcano after volcano has erupted beneath the feet of U.S. imperialism. The anti-imperialist struggle around the world has developed to a new stage, characterized by its universality, depth, and intensity. The wave in South Korea has not yet subsided, and the wave in Turkey has followed closely. Revolutionaries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America have already engaged in direct combat with the imperialists.

The revolutionary movements are developing vigorously, mutually supporting and influencing each other. As soon as workers and students in Seoul launched a struggle, workers and students in Busan, Daegu, and other parts of South Korea immediately rose up in response and support, unfolding fierce struggles in their local areas. The struggle of the South Korean people immediately aroused reactions abroad: tens and hundreds of thousands of people held demonstrations in Beijing and many other cities in China, and tens of thousands of people in cities such as Hanoi, Ulaanbaatar, and Tirana also expressed their support with actions. Millions of people in Japan and Cuba held marches and demonstrations. Their common enemy is one – U.S. imperialism.

This is the solidarity and mutual assistance of the oppressed and exploited people, the enthusiastic support of the people who have won the revolution for the people in struggle, and the spirit of proletarian internationalism.

What U.S. imperialists fear most is this kind of “chain reaction” of mutual support. American newspapers had just seen a little sign of the Turkish people’s actions, and they hurriedly issued a warning: an incident similar to that in South Korea may occur in Turkey. No sooner said than done, the Turkish people indeed rushed to the streets to march and demonstrate, resisting the suppression by the military and police, and demanding the downfall of Turkey's Syngman Rhee - Menderes. Students in a school in Istanbul were subjected to bloody suppression, and students from other schools immediately rose to support them; the people of Istanbul did not bow to the bloody suppression, and the people of Ankara continued to struggle.

Faced with the surging tide of struggle by the people of the world, U.S. imperialists also continuously "chain react," hastily deploying war forces everywhere. The Central Treaty Organization group meeting in Tehran has not yet finished its meeting to step up arms expansion and war preparations, and here the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is holding a meeting in Istanbul to establish a joint command to deploy combat, while at the same time conducting military exercises of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization on the seas of Bangkok and Manila in order to "deter" Southeast Asian countries. These chain reactions of U.S. imperialists not only expose their ferocious and evil faces, but also reveal their panic-stricken ugly態.

The people of South Korea went to the streets to demand democracy, and Syngman Rhee used tanks and cannons to massacre them, so the people had to use violence to drive away Syngman Rhee and his henchmen; the Turkish people had just taken to the streets to demand freedom, and Menderes sent tanks to the streets to suppress them, shooting and killing the marching masses, so the people could no longer just shout slogans demanding freedom, but could only use violence to overthrow the Menderes dictatorial government.

The reason why reactionaries are reactionaries, and imperialists are imperialists, is that they lift a stone only to drop it on their own feet. They use violence to arouse the people's anger, and the angry people have no choice but to use violence to deal with imperialism and all reactionaries.

In the use of violence, U.S. imperialism also has a "chain reaction": The military and police of Syngman Rhee have already achieved the "effect" of bloody suppression in South Korea, and now they are urging the Turkish government to step up the suppression of the people with the army "to avoid a revolution" – in fact, it is "to promote the revolution," which is simply idiotic! In fact, this is the destined fate of imperialism and all reactionaries, and it is not a question of whether they are stupid or wise.

The people have just shouted the call for democracy and freedom, and the imperialists and reactionaries have already opened up tanks and cannons to suppress them, and the American newspapers are still anxiously urging them, fearing that the suppression is not cruel enough. Judging from the situation in South Korea and Turkey this time, the modern revisionists' opposition to violence and their emphasis on so-called peaceful struggle precisely expose their faces as serving imperialism, and now it is clearer than ever.

As soon as the Turkish people's struggle occurred, American newspapers expressed "unease" and "worry," fully demonstrating the true face of the U.S. imperialists who take bloody suppression as their duty and act as world policemen as their profession. The more they act as bloody executioners, the more they want to proclaim themselves "envoys of civilization" and "envoys of peace." Lenin, as early as fifty-two years ago, when discussing the revolutionary movements in countries such as Turkey and Persia, had elaborated on this point: The "civilized" "activists" who are frightened by the revolutionary struggle, "what kind of beasts do they turn into when the masses rise up to fight against capital, against the capitalist colonial system, that is, the system of enslavement, plunder and violence?" (Complete Works of Lenin, Vol. XV, page 156)

The beasts are very brutal, but in the face of the masses who are rising up in struggle, they can only make some dying struggles.

    反帝斗争的新阶段
    蔡云
    美帝国主义脚下一座又一座的火山相继爆发了。世界各地反帝斗争发展到一个新阶段，它的特点是普遍、深入和激烈。南朝鲜的这一浪还没有过去，土耳其的这一浪又接上来了。亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的革命者已经和帝国主义者短兵相接了。
    革命运动正在互相支援、互相影响的情况下，如火如荼地发展着。汉城的工人学生一发动斗争，釜山、大丘和南朝鲜其他各地的工人学生立刻起来响应和支援，在当地展开激烈的斗争。南朝鲜人民的斗争又立刻引起国外的反应：中国的北京和许多别的城市举行几万几十万人的示威，在河内、乌兰巴托、地拉那……等各国城市也有成千上万的人用行动表示支持。日本、古巴的人民成百万地举行游行示威。大家的敌人都是一个——美帝国主义。
    这是被压迫被剥削人民的团结互助，这是革命胜利了的人民对斗争中的人民的热情支援，这是无产阶级的国际主义精神。
    美帝国主义者最怕的就是这种“连锁反应”式的互相支援。美国报纸刚看到土耳其人民行动的一点点苗头，就连忙发出警报：土耳其可能发生类似南朝鲜的事件。说时迟那时快，土耳其的人民果然冲到街上去游行示威，反抗军警的镇压，要求土耳其的李承晚——曼德列斯下台了。伊斯坦布尔一个学校的学生受到血腥的镇压，其他学校的学生立刻起来支援；伊斯坦布尔的人民没有向血腥镇压低头，安卡拉的人民接着奋起斗争了。
    美帝国主义者在全世界人民汹涌澎湃的斗争浪潮面前，也不断地“连锁反应”起来，急急慌慌地在四处部署战争力量，那里在德黑兰还没有开完中央条约组织集团为了加紧扩军备战而举行的会议，这里又在伊斯坦布尔举行为成立联合司令部以部署战斗的北大西洋集团会议，同时又为了“威慑”东南亚各国连忙在曼谷和马尼拉海面举行东南亚条约组织的军事演习。美帝国主义者的这些连锁反应，既暴露了自己穷凶极恶的面目，又显出了惶恐万状的丑态。
    南朝鲜的人民走到街上去要求民主，李承晚用坦克和枪炮来屠杀他们，人民只得用暴力来赶走李承晚和他的喽罗；土耳其人民刚走上街去要求自由，曼德列斯就开坦克上街镇压，枪杀游行群众，于是人民就不单是高喊要求自由的口号，而是只能用暴力来打倒曼德列斯独裁政府了。
    反动派之所以成为反动派，帝国主义之所以成为帝国主义，就是自己搬起石头打自己的脚，自己用暴力来激起人民的愤怒，愤怒的人民不得不用暴力来对付帝国主义和一切反动派。
    在使用暴力这一点上，美帝国主义也有“连锁反应”：李承晚的军警在南朝鲜已经得到了血腥镇压的“效果”，现在又催促土耳其政府用军队加紧镇压人民，“以免发生革命”，——实际上是“以便促进革命”，简直愚不可及！其实，帝国主义和一切反动派注定的命运就是这样，并不是愚不愚、智不智的问题。
    人民才喊出民主和自由的呼声，帝国主义和反动派已经开出坦克大炮来镇压，美国报纸还焦急地催促，唯恐镇压得不够残酷。从这次南朝鲜和土耳其的情况来看，现代修正主义者反对暴力和强调所谓和平斗争的主张，正好暴露他们为帝国主义服务的面目，现在是再清楚也没有了。
    土耳其人民的斗争一发生，美国报纸就表示“不安”和“担心”，充分地表现了以血腥镇压为己任的、以充当世界宪兵为职业的美帝国主义者的真面目。愈是充当血腥的刽子手，愈要宣扬自己是“文明使者”和“和平使者”，关于这一点，列宁远在五十二年前，在论到土耳其和波斯等国的革命运动时，就阐述过了：被革命斗争吓坏了的“文明的”“活动家”，“在群众奋起同资本、同资本主义殖民制度，即奴役、掠夺和暴力的制度作斗争的时候，竟变成了什么样的野兽”。（《列宁全集》十五卷一百五十六页）
    野兽很残暴，但在奋起斗争的群众面前，只能做些垂死的挣扎而已。
