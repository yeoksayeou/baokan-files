Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Third Session of the Third Shanghai Municipal People's Congress, lasting eight days, concluded on the 17th. The meeting passed a resolution calling on the people of the city to unite more closely around the Chinese Communist Party and the government, strive for progress, complete and overfulfill the national plan, achieve a better and more comprehensive continued leap forward this year, and courageously advance to build Shanghai into an industrial base for the production of high-grade, precision, and cutting-edge products and an advanced scientific research base in our country with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

The meeting reviewed the great achievements of Shanghai's continued Great Leap Forward on all fronts since 1959 and discussed and approved Shanghai's 1960 national economic plan and the 1959 final accounts and 1960 budget. Ke Qingshi, First Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPC and Mayor of Shanghai, made a political report at the meeting, and Cao Diqiu, Deputy Mayor of Shanghai, made a report on the draft of Shanghai's 1960 national economic plan.

In his report, Cao Diqiu summarized the great achievements made on all fronts in Shanghai in 1959, with all departments of the national economy completing and overfulfilling the national plan with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, realizing a comprehensive Great Leap Forward. In his report, Cao Diqiu put forward the general requirements of Shanghai's 1960 national economic plan: not only to complete and overfulfill the national plan, but also to actively develop high-grade, precision, and cutting-edge products, and strive for product quality to reach first-class standards; to save and comprehensively utilize raw materials in every possible way; to vigorously support the development of street industries; to greatly improve labor productivity, not only to increase production without increasing manpower, but also to save more labor. There will be a large increase in grain, cotton, and rapeseed in the suburbs. While vigorously developing agricultural production, it is necessary to actively promote the technological transformation of agriculture, vigorously carry out mass movements in scientific research, and vigorously carry out cultural revolution so that the working class's scientific and technological contingent can grow and strengthen rapidly.

Cao Diqiu said: Like all parts of the country, Shanghai will also vigorously establish urban people's communes. It is necessary to earnestly do all the practical work of establishing urban people's communes, and welcome the birth of this new thing with great enthusiasm and a very positive attitude, and promote its growth. Shanghai has a concentrated population and a complex situation. The ideological awareness, economic income, living standards, and living habits of all classes are somewhat different. We must implement the central government's policies and guidelines, both actively developing and adhering to the principle of voluntariness. We will never force those who are unwilling to participate for the time being. We must do a good job in production and collective welfare undertakings, fully demonstrate the superiority of collective life, and use facts to attract them. In this way, our urban people's communes will definitely be run well, and will be able to more widely mobilize the enthusiasm of the people of the city.

    会议检阅了1959年以来上海各条战线上继续大跃进的巨大成就，讨论和批准了上海市1960年国民经济计划和1959年决算、1960年预算。中共上海市委第一书记、上海市市长柯庆施在会上作了政治报告，上海市副市长曹荻秋作了关于上海市1960年国民经济计划草案的报告。
    曹荻秋在报告中概括地叙述了1959年上海各条战线上所取得的伟大成就，国民经济各部门都多快好省地完成和超额完成了国家计划，实现了全面大跃进。曹荻秋在报告中提出上海市1960年国民经济计划的总要求是：不但要完成和超额完成国家计划，而且要积极发展高级、精密、尖端产品，力争产品质量都达到第一流水平；千方百计节约和综合利用原料材料；大力支援街道工业的发展；大大提高劳动生产率，不但做到增产不增人，而且要节约更多的劳动力。郊区粮食、棉花、油菜籽都将有较大增长，在大力发展农业生产的同时要积极促进农业的技术改造，要大搞科学研究的群众运动，大搞文化革命，使工人阶级的科学技术队伍迅速成长壮大起来。
    曹荻秋说：上海和全国各地一样，也要大办城市人民公社。要切实做好建立城市人民公社的各项实际工作，用十分热情、十分积极的态度欢迎这个新生事物的诞生，促进它的成长。上海人口集中，情况复杂，各阶层的思想觉悟、经济收入、生活水平、生活习惯等有一定的差别，我们一定要贯彻中央的政策方针，既要积极发展、又要坚持自愿原则，对于一时不愿参加的人，决不勉强。我们要把生产和集体福利事业办好，充分显示集体生活的优越性，用事实来吸引他们。这样，我们的城市人民公社一定能够办得很好，就能更加广泛地调动全市人民的积极性。
