The conservative and reactionary forces in Yamaguchi Prefecture are very strong. Tanaka Giichi, known for his aggression against China, Matsuoka Yosuke, who signed the Anti-Comintern Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy, and Kishi Nobusuke, the current Prime Minister and war criminal, are all from Yamaguchi Prefecture. Even in such a place, the struggle against the "Security Treaty" has been rapidly developing.

As early as the Taiwan Strait crisis, young people from the Iwakuni "Peace Defense Association" in Yamaguchi Prefecture discovered that airplanes carrying atomic bombs were taking off from the Iwakuni U.S. military base every day. Through Japanese workers, they found three atomic bomb storage facilities and obtained photos of airplanes carrying atomic bombs. The Yamaguchi Prefecture Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs held a prefectural representative conference, issuing a call for the U.S. military to withdraw from the Iwakuni base. Eighty percent of the delegates attending this meeting were young people. Subsequently, a protest rally was held in Iwakuni City. After Hiroshima Prefecture responded, a people's conference of the two prefectures was held, setting off a surge of anti-American struggle. This conference made the commander of the Iwakuni U.S. military base tremble with fear, and security was tightened. This made us deeply realize how correct Chairman Mao's famous saying that American imperialism is a paper tiger is. In 1959, the "Youth League," together with youth activists from the Japan-China Friendship Association Youth Department and the Peace Committee, actively carried out street signature campaigns, organized 10,000 postcards protesting against the Kishi Nobusuke government and the U.S. President, and participated in peace marches against war and unemployment. Since the beginning of this year, the youth of Yamaguchi Prefecture, together with the people of the entire prefecture, have launched a large-scale protest struggle against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

The Japanese people, tempered in the struggle, have received strong support from the 650 million Chinese people. The Japanese people are infinitely grateful for the support of the Chinese people. The strong support of the Chinese people has also given the Japanese youth, who are the driving force for creating the future, infinite courage and confidence. We, the Japanese youth, will fight to the end at the cost of our lives to achieve final victory! (Attached pictures)

    斗争爆发在岸信介的家乡
    日中友好协会下关支部常任干事  繁泽菊马
    山口县的保守反动势力很大。曾经以侵略中国著称的田中义一、签订日德意三国法西斯防共协定的松冈洋右，以及现任首相战犯岸信介等都是山口县人。就在这样的地方，反对“安全条约”的斗争也迅速地开展起来了。
    早在台湾海峡事件时，山口县岩国“保卫和平会”的青年发现岩国美军基地每天都有载原子弹的飞机起飞。他们通过日本职工找到了三个原子弹仓库，弄到了载原子弹飞机的照片。山口县禁止原子弹氢弹协议会召开全县代表会议，发出要求美军撤销岩国基地的号召。参加这次会议的代表80％是青年。接着在岩国市召开了抗议大会。在广岛县响应后，又召开了两县人民大会，掀起了反美斗争的热潮。这次大会使岩国美军基地司令胆战心惊，戒备森严。这使我们深深体会到毛主席所说的美帝国主义是纸老虎的名言多么正确。1959年，“青年同盟”和日中友好协会青年部、和平委员会的青年活动家一道，积极进行街道签名运动、组织一万张对岸信介政府和美国总统抗议的明信片，并且参加反对战争和失业的和平大游行。今年以来，山口县青年和全县人民一道掀起了反对日美“安全条约”的大规模的抗议斗争。
    在斗争中受到锻炼的日本人民，得到了六亿五千万中国人民的强大支援，日本人民对中国人民的支援怀着无限的感激之情。中国人民的大力支援也给了作为创造未来的原动力的日本青年以无限的勇气和信心。我们日本青年将拼着生命为取得最后胜利而斗争到底！（附图片）
