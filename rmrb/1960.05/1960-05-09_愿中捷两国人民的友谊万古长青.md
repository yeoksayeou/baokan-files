    May the Friendship Between the Chinese and Czechoslovak Peoples Last Forever
    Xia Yan, President of the Sino-Czechoslovak Friendship Association

    May 9th this year marks the 15th anniversary of the liberation of Czechoslovakia. Starting from May 5th, various activities of "Sino-Czechoslovak Friendship Week" have been launched in Beijing, our capital, and many other important cities to express our warmest congratulations to the fraternal Czechoslovak people.

    In the fifteen years since liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, the heroic Czechoslovak people have made tremendous achievements on all fronts of socialist revolution and socialist construction. At present, its industrial output value has increased fourfold compared to 1937, and the socialist component in agriculture accounts for 85% of the country's cultivated land area. The people's material and cultural standards have been significantly improved.

    Because Czechoslovakia was a highly developed industrial country before the war, many bourgeois economists asserted that the socialist system was only suitable for economically underdeveloped countries and not for Czechoslovakia, which had highly developed industry. Now, the subjective wishes of these bourgeois scholars have been completely shattered. Over the past fifteen years, under the socialist system, Czechoslovak industry has not only developed at a high speed, but also undergone tremendous changes in terms of industrial layout and industrial structure, which are conducive to the development of the national economy. The output of some of Czechoslovakia's major industrial products, calculated on a per capita basis, has caught up with and surpassed the most developed capitalist countries. For example, on a per capita basis, Czechoslovakia's coal production exceeds that of the United States, West Germany, Britain, and France, and its steel production is close to that of the United States and West Germany, and exceeds that of Britain and France. Before liberation, 90% of Czechoslovakia's industry was concentrated in the western Czech and Moravian regions. Now, due to the rapid development of industry in the Slovak region, this unbalanced national industrial layout has been significantly improved. Before liberation, Czechoslovakia had not yet established an independent industrial system centered on machine manufacturing, so it still had to import many important industrial equipment from the West; now, in the entire industrial production of Czechoslovakia, the proportion of production of means of production has reached more than 60%, and a complete industrial system dominated by heavy industry, especially machine manufacturing, has been firmly established. Czechoslovakia's machine production ranks fourth in the world on a per capita basis, and its industrial equipment and machinery are exported to dozens of countries on five continents. In June 1958, the Eleventh Congress of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia formulated a grand plan to complete socialist construction. During the upcoming Third Five-Year Plan, its industrial production will increase by at least 50% compared to 1960, and will increase fivefold compared to 1937, the most developed year of industry before liberation.

    With the rapid development of socialist construction, Czechoslovakia has also achieved great achievements in science and culture. Before liberation, Czechoslovakia had only a very small number of state-run scientific research institutes with only more than 2,000 staff members; by the beginning of 1959, the number of scientific research institutes and laboratories organized by the state had reached 346, and the number of staff members had soared to 43,000. The Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences had only seven research institutes when it was established in 1952, but by 1959 it had grown to 89 research institutes and laboratories, becoming one of the largest research institutions in the world. Thanks to the strong leadership and strong support of the Communist Party and the government of Czechoslovakia, the scientific level of various departments has greatly improved. For example, mathematics, polarography, archeology, biology, and organic chemistry enjoy high reputations in the world. Czechoslovakia has manufactured the world's highest standard automatic steel rolling machine and is already producing complex equipment such as electromagnetic induction accelerators and electron microscopes that can magnify one million times.

    The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia has always attached great importance to the development of literature and art. Since the Eleventh Party Congress, it has further emphasized the importance of ideological remolding for cultural and art workers, connecting with the masses, and establishing a Marxist-Leninist world outlook. The Czechoslovak Socialist Culture Congress was convened last June, fully affirming the great achievements in cultural and artistic work since liberation, and also calling on cultural and artistic workers across the country to continue to wage a resolute struggle against bourgeois ideology, especially revisionist ideology, in order to complete the socialist revolution on the ideological front. Under the leadership of this correct literary and artistic policy, a vibrant and thriving scene is emerging in the literary and artistic circles of Czechoslovakia.

    Although China and Czechoslovakia are geographically far apart, because our two peoples have similar experiences in demanding national independence and opposing imperialist aggression, and have the common desire to build socialist and communist societies, the thoughts and feelings of our two peoples are very close. We supported each other in the difficult anti-fascist struggle, and after our two countries were liberated, we formed close allies in the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. In recent years, the leaders of our two parties and countries, with the best wishes and the most cordial feelings, have paid mutual visits. These mutual visits have made significant contributions to the development and strengthening of friendly cooperation between our two countries. Over the past decade, our two countries have signed the Sino-Czechoslovak Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation and various agreements on trade, culture, science and technology, post and telecommunications, health, and broadcasting. These treaties and agreements have become the bonds that consolidate and develop the friendship and cooperation between the peoples of our two countries.

    Over the past decade, economic cooperation between China and Czechoslovakia has been exciting. Czechoslovakia has not only provided our country with many machines and heavy machinery, but has also sent many outstanding experts to China to help our socialist construction. In April 1959, our two countries signed a long-term trade agreement for 1960 to 1962, which marked another step forward in economic cooperation between our two countries. Cultural exchanges and technical cooperation between our two countries have also developed rapidly in recent years. The two countries have exchanged students and graduate students, and have set up Czech and Chinese classes. Other aspects, such as the exchange of friendly visits and professional delegations, the exchange of art performance groups, the exchange of exhibitions, translation and publication, film and drama cooperation, etc., are also becoming more frequent and in-depth, and have achieved good results in enhancing mutual understanding and mutual learning between the peoples of the two countries. As of the end of 1959, China had sent a total of 127 cultural delegations to Czechoslovakia, totaling 1,621 people; Czechoslovakia sent 104 cultural delegations to China, totaling 1,077 people. China sent 12 art performance groups (teams) with 830 people; Czechoslovakia sent 9 art performance groups (teams) with 619 people. Over the past decade, China has translated and published 141 kinds of Czechoslovak books in literature, art, philosophy, social sciences, and natural sciences, including Julius Fučík's "Report from the Gallows," Hašek's "The Good Soldier Švejk," and former President Zápotocký's "New Fighters Stand Up," which have become China's best-selling books. During the same period, Czechoslovakia translated and published 127 kinds of Chinese works, including works by Lu Xun, Guo Moruo, Mao Dun, Lao She, Zhao Shuli, and others. Over the past decade, China has exported 85 films of various types to Czechoslovakia, and Czechoslovakia has imported 78 films of various types to China. Chinese films "The White Haired Girl," "Daughter of China," and "Blessing," and Czechoslovak films "New Fighters Stand Up," "Battle Before Dawn," and "The Good Soldier Švejk" have been warmly welcomed by audiences in both countries.

    From cities to villages, from Prague to Beijing, the flowers of friendship between the Chinese and Czechoslovak peoples are blooming everywhere. In our country, there are people's communes named "Sino-Czechoslovak Friendship," and in Czechoslovakia, there are machine manufacturing plants and agricultural cooperatives named "Czech-Chinese Friendship." Just a few days ago, we renamed the Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Factory as "Sino-Czechoslovak Friendship Factory." Ten years is only a very short time, but looking back on the past and looking forward to the future, we will deeply feel that this friendship between our two peoples, built on the basis of proletarian internationalism, is unbreakable and will surely develop more widely and deeply.

    May the people of the Czechoslovak Republic be happy and the country prosperous! May the friendship between the Chinese and Czechoslovak peoples be as solid as a rock and last forever!

    愿中捷两国人民的友谊万古长青
    中捷友好协会会长　夏衍
    今年5月9日，是捷克斯洛伐克解放十五周年的伟大节日，从5月5日起，在我国首都北京和许多重要城市都展开了“中捷友好周”的各种活动，对兄弟的捷克斯洛伐克人民表示最热烈的祝贺。
    解放十五年来，英勇的捷克斯洛伐克人民在捷克斯洛伐克共产党的领导下，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的各个战线上，都取得了极其巨大的成就。目前，她的工业产值已经增长到1937年的四倍，农业中的社会主义成份已占全国耕地面积的85％。人民的物质、文化水平有了很显著的提高。
    由于捷克斯洛伐克在战前就是一个工业很发达的国家，所以有许多资产阶级经济学家就断言社会主义制度只适合于经济不发达的国家而不适合于工业高度发展的捷克斯洛伐克。现在，这种资产阶级学者们的主观愿望完全被粉碎了。十五年来，在社会主义制度下的捷克斯洛伐克工业不仅有了高速度的发展，而且在工业布局和工业结构方面，都发生了巨大的、有利于国民经济发展的变化。捷克斯洛伐克的一些主要工业产品的产量，按人口比例已经赶上和超过了工业最发达的资本主义国家，例如按人口平均计算，捷克斯洛伐克的煤产量超过了美国、西德、英国和法国，钢产量接近了美国、西德，超过了英国、法国。在解放前，捷克斯洛伐克工业的90％集中在西部的捷克和摩拉维亚地区，而现在，由于斯洛伐克地区的工业有了迅速的发展，这种全国工业布局不平衡的情况已经有了显著的改善。在解放前，捷克斯洛伐克还没有建立起以机器制造业为中心的独立的工业体系，所以她有许多重要的工业设备还要从西方输入；而现在，在捷克斯洛伐克整个工业生产中，生产资料的生产比重已达60％以上，一个以重工业为主、特别是以机器制造业为中心的完整的工业体系已经巩固地建立起来了。捷克斯洛伐克的机器生产量按人口平均计算占世界第四，她的工业设备和机器输出到五大洲的几十个国家。1958年6月，捷克斯洛伐克共产党第十一次代表大会制定了完成社会主义建设的宏伟计划，在即将开始的第三个五年计划期间，她的工业生产最少要比1960年增长50％，而与解放前工业最发达的1937年相比将增长五倍。
    随着社会主义建设的迅速发展，捷克斯洛伐克在科学、文化方面也获得了巨大的成就。在解放前，捷克斯洛伐克只有极少数的国立科学研究所，工作人员只有二千多人；到1959年初，国家举办的科学研究所和实验室已达三百四十六个，工作人员激增到四万三千人。捷克斯洛伐克科学院在1952年建立的时候只有七个研究所，到1959年已经增长到八十九个研究所和实验室，而成为世界上最大的研究机构之一。由于捷克斯洛伐克共产党和政府的坚强领导和大力支持，各部门的科学水平都有了很大的提高，例如数学、极谱学、考古学、生物学、有机化学等方面，都在世界上享有很高的荣誉。捷克斯洛伐克已经制造出了世界最高标准的自动轧钢机器，并已经在生产像电磁感应加速器和可以放大一百万倍的电子显微镜这些复杂的装备。
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党一向十分重视文学艺术事业的发展，十一次党代表大会以来，更进一步地强调了文化艺术工作者必须进行思想改造，联系群众，树立马克思列宁主义世界观的重要意义。去年6月召开了捷克斯洛伐克社会主义文化代表大会，充分肯定了解放以来在文化艺术工作中的巨大成就，同时也号召全国文化艺术工作者为了完成思想战线上的社会主义革命，必须继续对资产阶级思想、特别是修正主义思想进行坚决的斗争。在这一正确文艺方针的领导下，捷克斯洛伐克的文艺界正出现着一种生气蓬勃、欣欣向荣的景象。
    中国和捷克斯洛伐克在地理上虽则相隔很远，但是，由于我们两国人民有着要求民族独立和反对帝国主义侵略的类似的经历，有着建设社会主义、共产主义社会的共同的愿望，因此，我们两国人民的思想感情，是十分亲近的。在危难的反法西斯斗争中我们曾相互支持，在两国获得了解放之后我们就结成了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营中的亲密的盟友。近年来，我们两国的党和国家的领导人带着最良好的祝愿和最亲切的感情，进行了相互访问。这种相互访问对发展和加强我们两国之间的友好合作作出了重大的贡献。十年来，我们两国之间签订了中捷友好合作条约和贸易、文化、科学技术、邮电、卫生、广播等各种协定。这些条约和协定成为巩固和发展我们两国人民之间的友谊和合作的纽带。
    十年来，中捷两国在经济方面的合作是令人兴奋的。捷克斯洛伐克不仅向我国提供了许多机器设备和重型机器，还派遣了许多优秀的专家到中国来帮助我们的社会主义建设。1959年4月，我们两国签订了1960年到1962年的长期贸易协定，这标志着我们两国之间的经济合作又前进了一步。我们两国之间的文化交流和技术合作，近年来也有了迅速的发展。两国互派了留学生、研究生，互设了捷文班和中文班，其他如两国互派友好访问和专业代表团，互派艺术表演团队，互办展览，翻译出版，电影、戏剧合作等等方面，也都是日益频繁，更加深入，而对增进两国人民之间的相互了解和相互学习，取得了很好的效果。截至1959年底，我国派往捷克斯洛伐克文化代表团共一百二十七起，计一千六百二十一人；捷克斯洛伐克派赴我国的文化代表团一百零四起，一千零七十七人。我国派往的艺术表演团（队）十二起，八百三十人；捷克斯洛伐克派来的艺术表演团（队）九起，六百一十九人。十年来，我国翻译出版了捷克斯洛伐克的文学、艺术、哲学、社会科学、自然科学等方面的书籍一百四十一种，其中如尤利乌斯·伏契克的“绞刑架下的报告”、哈谢克的“好兵帅克”、故总统萨波托斯基的“新战士站起来”等，都成了我国最畅销的书籍。同一时期，捷克斯洛伐克翻译出版了中国著作一百二十七种，其中包括鲁迅、郭沫若、茅盾、老舍、赵树理等的作品。十年来，我国向捷克斯洛伐克输出各种影片八十五部，捷克斯洛伐克向我国输入了各种影片七十八部，我国影片“白毛女”、“中华女儿”、“祝福”，捷克斯洛伐克影片“新战士站起来”、“黎明前的战斗”、“好兵帅克”等等，都受到对方广大观众的热烈欢迎。
    从城市到农村，从布拉格到北京，中捷两国人民之间的友谊之花正在遍地开放。在我国有以“中捷友好”命名的人民公社，在捷克斯洛伐克也有以“捷中友好”命名的机器制造厂、农业合作社，就在几天之前，我们又把沈阳第二机床厂命名为“中捷友谊工厂”。十年，只不过是一个很短暂的时间，但是回顾一下过去，展望一下将来，我们都会深切地感觉到，我们两国人民之间的建立在无产阶级国际主义基础上的这种友谊，是牢不可破的，是一定会更宽广、更深入地发展的。
    愿捷克斯洛伐克共和国人民幸福、国运隆昌！愿中捷两国人民的友谊固如磐石，万古长青！
