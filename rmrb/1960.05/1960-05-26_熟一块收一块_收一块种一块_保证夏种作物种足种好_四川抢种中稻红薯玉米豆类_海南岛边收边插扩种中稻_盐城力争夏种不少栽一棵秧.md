Yancheng Strives to Plant Every Seedling in Summer Sowing

(Our report) Sichuan Province's tens of millions of laborers engaged in the rush to harvest and plant are fighting with all their strength, and the province's summer harvest and planting work is achieving successive victories. Moving scenes of "fields turning yellow in the morning, filled with water at noon, and rows of seedlings in the afternoon" are appearing everywhere. As of May 15th, the statistics show that the province has harvested more than 34 million mu of spring crops, accounting for 65.4% of the area to be harvested. Among them, peas, broad beans, and rapeseed have been harvested by about 90%, barley has been harvested by 75.4%, and wheat has been harvested by more than half. Neijiang, Nanchong, Luzhou, Yibin, Jiangjin, Chongqing, Zigong and other special districts and cities have basically completed the spring harvest.

While rushing to harvest spring crops, various localities have also adopted the method of harvesting, plowing, and planting simultaneously to plant summer crops in a concentrated way. The province has planted more than 7.9 million mu of mid-season rice, accounting for 22.7% of the planned area, with an average daily progress of 680,000 mu; the area sown with mid-season corn and direct sowing and transplanting of cotton has reached about 90% of the planned area; and peanuts have completed more than 70% of the sowing plan. In addition, more than 540,000 mu of sweet potatoes have been planted, as well as large quantities of soybeans, mixed beans, and so on.

While rushing to harvest and plant, the field management of crops that have already been planted has been stepped up. Emei County implemented a labor matching method to carry out a dragon-style competition of harvesting, plowing, fertilizing, and planting seedlings, so that the spring harvest was followed by plowing, sufficient fertilizer was applied, and the fields were full of seedlings. Nanbu County rationally arranged labor, harvesting spring crops while transplanting cotton seedlings, so that one plot of wheat was harvested, one plot was plowed, and one plot was transplanted, greatly accelerating the progress of cotton seedling transplanting. In order to plant more sweet potatoes earlier, some areas in the Luzhou Special District had secretaries taking the lead in commanding the sprouting of sweet potato seedlings, driving the masses to apply top dressing and watering in a timely manner, and vigorously promoting sweet potato seedlings.

Various places in Sichuan have also planted large quantities of bean crops in accordance with the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee. Wenjiang, Wanxian, and Mianyang Special Districts have launched mass movements to increase bean planting. The vast number of cadres and masses in Wenjiang Special District are determined to plant more than one billion nests of beans in May, in addition to completing the task of rushing to harvest and plant with quality and quantity; various places in Wanxian Special District, on the basis of the great achievements made in planting soybeans in the previous stage, continue to plant large quantities of bean crops, and the entire district guarantees that each person can increase the harvest by five to ten pounds of beans.

(Our dispatch from Guangzhou, May 25) Hainan Island is harvesting early rice while planting mid-season rice. Harvesting occurs at the front and planting follows behind. At present, more than 400,000 mu of mid-season rice have been planted on the island.

Hainan Island has superior natural conditions and three harvests a year. Early and mid-season rice can be planted in succession. Based on the successful experience of planting mid-season rice in the past, Party committees at all levels in Hainan District have decided to plant more mid-season rice this year. Many counties strengthened the preparation for planting mid-season rice long before the early rice harvest. While strengthening the late-stage field management of early rice, Chengmai County transferred 20% to 25% of its labor force to form a professional team and invested in mid-season production. The Linggao Commune of this county concentrated 8,000 laborers and attacked for six days, planting 11,500 mu of mid-season rice, exceeding the original plan by 9.5%. Ya County also launched a high-efficiency movement to speed up rice planting. On May 12, the county had planted more than 62,000 mu of mid-season rice, overfulfilling the mid-season rice planting plan.

(Our dispatch from Nanjing, May 25) While vigorously grasping the progress of rushing to harvest and plant, Yancheng County, Jiangsu Province, has taken various practical and effective measures to vigorously grasp the quality of harvesting and planting, and is determined not to lose a single grain or plant a seedling less. As of the 21st, the county's 200,000 mu of paddy fields had been planted, and each plot met the standards; the 290,000 mu of Da Yuan wheat that had been harvested generally achieved careful harvesting and threshing, and the grains were returned to the household.

Since last winter, Yancheng County's "Catch Up with Jiangnan" movement has made this year's summer harvest crops grow with thick stalks, strong leaves, large ears, and many grains, presenting a scene of bumper harvest. In order to achieve a bumper harvest and plant as soon as we reap, Yancheng County concentrated more than 85%, about 300,000 laborers, on the summer harvest and planting front, and the daily harvest progress increased from 20,000 mu to 80,000 mu, and the daily planting progress also increased from 10,000 mu to more than 50,000 mu. While rushing to harvest and plant, the communes and production teams vigorously grasped the quality of harvesting and planting. First of all, Party organizations at all levels strengthened the ideological education of cadres and the masses on cherishing food, returning grains to the household, and paying attention to the quality of harvesting and planting. Many commune members consciously formulated bumper harvest covenants. When rushing to harvest and plant, the county, commune, and team Party committee secretaries also personally went to the forefront, first set up harvesting and planting model fields in "Little Jiangnan" to implement quality requirements, and then promoted them universally in ordinary fields.

    熟一块收一块　收一块种一块　保证夏种作物种足种好
    四川抢种中稻红薯玉米豆类
    海南岛边收边插扩种中稻　盐城力争夏种不少栽一棵秧
    本报讯　四川省几千万名抢收抢种劳动大军正全力奋战，全省夏收夏种工作节节胜利，到处出现了上午一片黄、中午水汪汪、下午秧成行的动人景象。截至5月15日统计：全省已收小春作物三千四百多万亩，占应收面积的65.4％，其中豌豆胡豆和油菜已收90％左右，大麦收了75.4％，小麦已收一半以上。内江、南充、泸州、宜宾、江津、重庆、自贡等专区、市，已基本结束小春收割工作。
    各地在抢收小春同时，还采取边收割、边犁耙、边栽种的办法，突击栽种大春作物。全省已栽中稻七百九十多万亩，占计划面积的22.7％，平均日进度为六十八万亩；中玉米播种和棉花直播、移栽面积已达到计划面积的90％左右；花生已完成播种计划70％以上。此外，还栽了红苕五十四万多亩，种了大量的黄豆、杂豆等等。
    在抢收抢栽的同时，抓紧了已种作物的田间管理工作。峨眉县实行劳力配套办法，开展收割、犁田、下肥、栽秧一条龙竞赛，做到了小春收起田犁转，肥料施足秧满田。南部县合理安排劳力，边收小春边栽棉苗，做到小麦收一块，就翻耕一块，移栽一块，大大加快了棉苗移栽进度。为了早栽多栽红苕，泸州专区有些地区书记挂帅大搞红苕催苗指挥田，带动群众及时追肥浇水，猛催苕苗。
    四川各地还根据省委指示大量种植豆类作物。温江、万县、绵阳专区各地开展了群众性增种豆类运动。温江专区广大干部和群众，决心在5月份，除按质按量完成抢收抢种任务外，增种豆类十亿窝以上；万县专区各地，在前一阶段种植黄豆取得巨大成绩的基础上，继续大量增种豆类作物，全区保证做到每人能增收五至十斤豆子。
    本报广州25日电　海南岛边割早稻，边插中稻，前边收割，后边插秧，目前全岛已插下中稻四十多万亩。
    海南岛自然条件优越，一年三收，早中稻可以连作。海南区各级党委根据过去种植中稻的成功经验，今年都决定多种中稻。许多县早在早稻收割以前就加强了中稻栽插的准备。澄迈县在加强早稻后期田间管理的同时，抽调了20％到25％的劳动力，组成专业队伍，投入中造生产。这个县的临高公社集中了八千个劳动力，突击六天，便种下中稻一万一千五百亩，超过原订计划9.5％。崖县还开展了高工效运动，加快插秧进度。5月12日，这个县已种下中稻六万二千多亩，超额完成中稻插秧计划。
    本报南京25日电　江苏省盐城县在狠抓抢收抢种进度的同时，采取各项切实有力的措施，狠抓收种质量，坚决做到不损一粒粮，不少栽一棵秧。到21日止，全县二十万亩稻田已经栽完，块块符合标准；已收的二十九万亩大元麦，一般都做到细收细打，颗粒还家。
    盐城县去冬以来就开展的“赶江南”运动，使今年的夏收作物长得秆粗叶壮、穗大粒多，一片丰收景象。为做到丰产丰收、随收随种，盐城县集中了85％以上约三十万劳力到夏收夏种战线上来，收割日进度由二万亩增加到八万亩，播种日进度也由一万亩增加到五万多亩。在抢收抢种的同时，各公社、生产队狠抓收种质量。首先各级党组织加强了干部和群众爱惜粮食、颗粒还家、注意收种质量的思想教育，许多社员并自觉地制订了丰产丰收公约。在抢收抢种时县社队各级党委书记又亲临最前线，先在“小江南”上做好收种样板田，贯彻质量要求，然后在一般田内普遍推广。
