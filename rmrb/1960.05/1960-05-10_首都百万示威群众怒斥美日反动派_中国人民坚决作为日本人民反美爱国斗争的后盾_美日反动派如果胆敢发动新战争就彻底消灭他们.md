Xinhua News Agency, 9th. Our correspondent reports: The people of China's capital roared out their anger today, with over a million people gathering in Tiananmen Square for an unprecedented large-scale demonstration, resolutely opposing the US-Japan military alliance treaty, resolutely opposing the revival of Japanese militarism, resolutely opposing the US-Japan reactionaries' heinous plot to plan a new war, and resolutely supporting the just struggle of the Japanese people.

The entire Tiananmen Square and the six-li-long East and West Chang'an Avenue were completely filled with demonstrating masses. The steps of the Great Hall of the People and the Museum of the Revolution and the Museum of History were also lined with demonstration contingents. Above the boundless sea of demonstrators, thousands of red flags fluttered in the wind, like raging flames. The roar of anger from the million-strong masses shook the heavens and the earth.

Beijing and Tokyo held large-scale demonstrations almost simultaneously today. This shows the common will and determination of the Chinese and Japanese people to resolutely oppose the US-Japan military alliance.

At noon, thousands of demonstration contingents marched from factories, schools, people's communes, government offices, and People's Liberation Army garrisons, converging in a mighty torrent on Tiananmen Square. By 3:00 p.m., Tiananmen Square was a sea of people. Neat formations of militia, carrying rifles, and PLA soldiers from the army, navy and air force, without weapons, listened to the speeches from Tiananmen Gate alongside vast ranks of workers, peasants, students, and government cadres. When Liao Chengzhi, representing the CCP Central Committee, solemnly declared that the 650 million Chinese people resolutely support the Japanese people's opposition to the revival of Japanese militarism, and when Japanese friends firmly stated that the Japanese people will never again fight against the Chinese people, the million-strong masses applauded enthusiastically and shouted slogans. This earth-shattering roar was broadcast live to every corner of the motherland. This roar inspired the hearts of every Chinese person.

Japanese friends announced at the meeting: "Warmongers will inevitably be executed by the people." Farmers from Lugouqiao in China firmly believe this. Qi Wenzhou, a disabled veteran whose leg was damaged by Japanese shells during the "July 7th" Incident, made a red flag today and asked his neighbors to take it to Tiananmen Square for the demonstration. Fully armed militia from Lugouqiao said during the parade that if the US-Japan reactionaries dare to launch a new war, we will completely eliminate them.

The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company sent 5,000 steelworkers to participate in the parade and rally. Miners from the Jingxi Coal Mine, wearing miner's clothes, came from more than 30 kilometers outside the city to attend the meeting. Last night, the miners wrote letters to the workers of the Miike Coal Mine in Japan, who are fighting despite the suppression of the Kishi Nobusuke government, expressing their heartfelt respect and resolute support.

The defenders of our great motherland - the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the powerful militia - expressed great anger at the US imperialist attempt to revive Japanese militarism and re-ignite a new war. Liu Zhimin, a veteran guerrilla fighter from the War of Resistance Against Japan, personally led the militia of the Capital Machinery Factory to participate in the meeting. He said: "We must support the just struggle of the Japanese people. If the enemy dares to launch a war, I will definitely lead the militia of this factory to enlist."

Over 100,000 university students in the capital, carrying huge banners and cartoons, converged on Tiananmen Square from urban and suburban areas in a magnificent manner. Students from Tsinghua University shouted slogans along the way and distributed poetry leaflets that had been printed overnight to the people. Before the meeting began, youth in the contingents of Peking University and Beijing Normal University performed skits. When some students playing the roles of the Japanese people punched out at an Eisenhower wearing a tall hat and a Kishi Nobusuke in a kimono, the surrounding masses shouted: "Oppose the revival of Japanese militarism!" Some students from the Beijing Overseas Chinese Students Supplementary School held a discussion last night. They believe that as long as the Japanese people continue to struggle resolutely, they will surely obtain the happy days that the Chinese people enjoy today.

Foreign guests from many Asian, African, and Latin American countries who participated in today's meeting were very excited. They believe that this meeting is not only a support for the Japanese people, but also a support for the people in other regions of Asia, Africa, and Latin America who are struggling, and it is a great encouragement to them. Takano Minoru, Vice Chairman of the Japan National Metal Workers' Union, excitedly told reporters: Today's meeting has further strengthened my confidence that the Japanese people's struggle against the US-Japan "Security Treaty," as long as they continue to struggle resolutely and bravely, will surely achieve victory. Komori Masao, Deputy Head of the Japan General Council of Trade Unions delegation to China, said that the million-strong meeting held by the Chinese people today shows the great strength of the people and further strengthens the courage of our Japanese working class to fight.

Hwang Bong-koo, a peace activist from Korea, said that the million-strong meeting held in China's capital today is not only a strong support for the Japanese people, but also a great encouragement to the struggling South Korean people and the people of Asian countries.

Mohamed Daham, Political Secretary of the Somali Coast Democratic Union, which is fighting against French colonialism, said that today's meeting shows the Chinese people's and the world's people's strong desire for peace and their firm will to oppose imperialism. The African people are well aware that the great Chinese and Soviet people support the African people's struggle against imperialism and colonialism.

Among the crowd of foreign guests who were vigorously shouting the slogan "People of the world, unite and overthrow US imperialism!" was Coro, the Propaganda Secretary of the General Confederation of Workers of the Congo. He said that I am very moved by the Chinese people's support for the anti-imperialist struggles of the oppressed people in backward countries. The Chinese people have rich experience in the anti-imperialist struggle, and we have learned a lot from China's anti-imperialist struggle. The Congolese people fully support the struggle of the Japanese people.

Today's unprecedented demonstration and rally linked the people of Beijing with the Japanese people who are launching the 16th unified action against the US-Japan military alliance treaty. An unforgettable and moving scene appeared at the end of the meeting. At that time, thousands of demonstrators applauded and saluted the Japanese friends on the Tiananmen Gate, shouting slogans and singing the song "Unity is Strength" again and again. The Japanese friends waved small flags, clapped their hands, and waved their hats and scarves, warmly thanking the Chinese people for their support. Some even excitedly shouted "Long live peace!" This lasted for as long as twenty minutes, with the militant friendship of the Chinese and Japanese people blending together on and off the stage. (Photo attached)

    首都百万示威群众怒斥美日反动派
    中国人民坚决作为日本人民反美爱国斗争的后盾
    美日反动派如果胆敢发动新战争就彻底消灭他们
    据新华社9日讯　本社记者报道：中国首都人民今天发出了怒吼，一百多万人汇集天安门广场，举行了规模空前的大示威，坚决反对日美军事同盟条约，坚决反对复活日本军国主义，坚决反对美日反动派策划新战争的罪恶阴谋，坚决支持日本人民的正义斗争。
    整个天安门广场和六华里长的东西长安大街上，全部站满了示威的群众。人民大会堂和革命博物馆、历史博物馆的台阶上也排列着示威队伍。在一望无际的示威队伍上面，万千红旗猎猎飘舞，如同熊熊的烈火。百万群众发出的怒吼声，震天动地。
    北京和东京，今天几乎在同时举行大示威。这显示了中日两国人民坚决反对日美军事同盟的共同意志和决心。
  中午，千百支示威队伍就从工厂、学校、人民公社、机关和人民解放军驻地，浩浩荡荡地向天安门广场汇集。下午三时，天安门广场上已是一片人海。排列在广场中央背着枪的严整的民兵队伍和没有携带武器的陆海空军三军战士的队伍，同广大的工人、农民、学生、机关干部的队伍倾听天安门上的讲话。当中共中央的代表廖承志庄严地宣告，六亿五千万中国人民坚决支持日本人民反对复活日本军国主义的时候，当日本的朋友坚决地表示，日本人民决不再与中国人民作战的时候，百万群众热烈鼓掌，高呼口号，这时震天动地的吼声经过实况广播传到了祖国各个角落。这吼声激励着每一个中国人民的心。
    日本的朋友在会上这样的宣布说：“战争贩子必将被人民所处决”。中国芦沟桥的农民坚信这一点。“七七”事变时被日本炮弹炸坏了腿的残废者祁文周，今天做了一面红旗，托邻居们带到天安门广场示威。全副武装的芦沟桥的民兵在游行时说，如果美日反动派胆敢发动新战争，我们一定要彻底消灭他们。
    石景山钢铁公司参加游行和集会的有五千名钢铁工人。穿着矿工服装的京西煤矿的矿工们，从离城三十多公里外赶来参加大会。昨天晚上，矿工们曾经纷纷写信给不顾岸信介政府的镇压、坚持斗争的日本三池煤矿工人，向他们表示衷心的敬意和坚决的支持。
    我们伟大祖国的保卫者——中国人民解放军官兵和强大的民兵队伍对美帝国主义企图复活日本军国主义，重新挑起新战争的阴谋表示极大愤怒。抗日战争的老游击队员刘志民，亲自率领首都机械厂的民兵前来参加大会。他说：“我们一定要支持日本人民的正义斗争，如果敌人胆敢发动战争，我一定率领这个厂的民兵去应征。”
    首都十多万大学生抬着巨幅标语、漫画，从城区、郊外，气势雄壮地向天安门广场汇集。清华大学的学生沿途高呼口号，还把连夜赶印成的诗传单散发给人们。大会开始以前，在北京大学、北京师范大学的队伍里，青年们演起了活报剧，当一些学生们扮演的日本人民伸出拳头向戴着高帽子的艾森豪威尔，穿着和服的岸信介打去时，四周的群众高喊：“反对复活日本军国主义！”北京市归国华侨学生中等补习学校的部分学生昨晚举行了座谈会。他们认为只要日本人民坚决斗争下去，也一定会获得像中国人民今天这样的幸福日子。
    参加今天大会的亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲许多国家的外宾，情绪十分激动，他们认为这个大会不仅是对日本人民的支持，也是对亚洲其他地区和非洲、拉丁美洲正在斗争着的人民的支持，使他们受到极大的鼓舞。日本全国金属劳动组合副委员长高野实激动地向记者说：今天的大会，使我进一步加强了一种信心：日本人民反对日美“安全条约”的斗争，只要继续坚决勇敢地斗争下去，一定能够取得胜利。日本工会总评议会访华代表团副团长小森正夫说，中国人民今天举行的一百多万人的大会，显示了人民的巨大力量，使我们日本工人阶级进一步增强了斗争的勇气。
    朝鲜和平人士黄凤九说，中国首都今天举行一百多万人的大会，不但对于日本人民是一个有力的支持，对于斗争着的南朝鲜人民和亚洲各国人民也都起了巨大的鼓舞作用。
    正在同法国殖民主义者进行斗争的法属索马里兰民主联盟政治书记穆罕默德·达汉说，今天的大会显示了中国人民和全世界人民热爱和平的强烈愿望，和反对帝国主义的坚强意志。非洲人民很了解伟大的中国和苏联人民支持非洲人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争。
    在激烈地高呼“全世界人民团结起来，打倒美帝国主义！”口号的外宾人群中，有刚果全国工人联合会宣传书记哥罗。他说，中国人民支援落后国家被压迫人民的反帝斗争，使我很感动。中国人民反帝斗争有着丰富的经验，我们从中国学习到许多反帝斗争的经验。刚果人民全力支持日本人民的斗争。
    今天规模空前的示威和集会，使北京人民同正在展开反对日美军事同盟条约第十六次统一行动的日本人民心心相连。大会结束时出现了一番令人难忘的动人情景。那时，千万个示威群众向天安门城楼上的日本朋友鼓掌致意，高呼口号，一遍又一遍地高唱“团结就是力量”的歌曲；日本朋友们挥舞着小旗，打着拍子，摇动着帽子和围巾，热烈地答谢中国人民的支持，有的还兴奋地高呼“和平万岁！”这样一直持续达二十分钟之久，台上台下交融着中日两国人民的战斗友谊。（附图片）
