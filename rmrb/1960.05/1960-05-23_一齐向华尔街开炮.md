    Let's All Open Fire on Wall Street
    Heilongjiang Materials Bureau  Wang Chengzhi
    A storm of liberation is sweeping through Seoul,
    Ankara echoes with cries for freedom,
    Mount Fuji is burning with fury again,
    A strong east wind is blowing up a revolutionary tide against imperialism.
    A strong east wind is blowing up a revolutionary tide against imperialism,
    Surging and turbulent, oh, the waves are rolling,
    From the Pacific to the Atlantic,
    It rolls straight towards the lair of American imperialism!
    It rolls straight towards the lair of American imperialism,
    To break the shackles and iron prisons!
    Whether it's a continent or a small island,
    The volcanoes of revolution will burn.
    The volcanoes of revolution will burn,
    The red flags of revolution are flying everywhere in the wind!
    People all over the world have found their direction,
    Aiming at the target: Let's all open fire on Wall Street!

    一齐向华尔街开炮
    黑龙江物资局  王成志汉城掀起了争解放的风暴，安卡拉响起求自由的呼号，富士山又在愤怒地燃烧，万里东风劲吹起反帝的怒潮。万里东风劲吹起反帝的怒潮，汹涌澎湃呵波浪滔滔，从太平洋到大西洋，直卷向美帝国主义的老巢！直卷向美帝国主义的老巢，要打破枷锁和铁牢！不论是大陆还是小岛，革命的火山都要燃烧。革命的火山都要燃烧，革命的红旗到处迎风飘！全世界人民都找好了方向，对准目标：一齐向华尔街开炮！
