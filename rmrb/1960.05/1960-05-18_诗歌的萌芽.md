Title: The Budding of Poetry

    The budding of children's poetry is the budding of poetry.
    The bud is meant to grow, and I wish it a smooth growth.
    But the bud is afraid of pests and diseases; with pests and diseases, the bud cannot grow.
    The most serious pest is pride and complacency.
    Chairman Mao said: "Modesty helps one to progress, pride makes one lag behind."
    If one commits the fault of pride and complacency, then the bud will wither from then on.
    Therefore, I hope that the children whose poems have been selected for this collection will never be complacent, and will firmly keep Chairman Mao's teachings in mind.

    诗歌的萌芽
    郭沫若
    少年儿童的诗歌是诗歌的萌芽。
    萌芽是要成长的，我祝福它顺畅地成长。
    但是萌芽是怕病虫害的，有了病虫害，萌芽便不能成长了。
    最严重的病虫害就是骄傲自满。
    毛主席说：“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后。”
    如果犯了骄傲自满的毛病，那萌芽就从此萎缩了。
    因此，我希望有诗被选进这个集子里面的小朋友们，千万不要自满，要把毛主席的教导牢牢地记在心里。
