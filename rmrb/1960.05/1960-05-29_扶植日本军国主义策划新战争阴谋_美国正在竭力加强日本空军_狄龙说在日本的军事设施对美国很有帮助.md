　　Xinhua News Agency, May 28th dispatch from Washington: U.S. Under Secretary of State Dillon recently revealed during a secret testimony before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on "Mutual Security" that the United States is stepping up its efforts to strengthen the Japanese Air Force through military "aid."

　　According to Dillon's testimony, which was released by the subcommittee on the 26th, a member of Congress asked Dillon: Why does the U.S. government's military "aid" plan stipulate that the U.S. provides Japan with more military aircraft than the number of qualified pilots Japan has to fly them? Dillon replied, "Of course, we are trying to get the Japanese to strengthen their air force..." Dillon also said that the military facilities the United States uses in Japan are "very helpful" to the United States.
