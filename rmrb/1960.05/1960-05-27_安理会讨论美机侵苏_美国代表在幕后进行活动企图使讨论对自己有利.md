Xinhua News Agency, New York, 26th: The United Nations Security Council, at its meeting on the 25th, effectively concluded the discussion on the issue of the intrusion of a US military aircraft into the Soviet Union, which poses a threat to universal peace.

The US delegation engaged in many activities, both in the meeting and behind the scenes, attempting to steer the discussion in a direction favorable to the US and to divert public opinion from the dangerous and provocative policy pursued by the US. Some representatives of non-permanent members, while expressing their unease about the US government's policy and, to varying degrees, condemning US spy flights in other countries' airspace, also tried to exonerate the US to varying degrees, lacking the courage to support the Soviet proposal to condemn the US aircraft's act of aggression.

Tunisian representative Mongi Slim pointed out that his country could not consider the violation of the airspace of sovereign states as justified, regardless of the reasons. He said that the members of the Security Council knew that Tunisia's airspace had been repeatedly violated by military aircraft engaged in aggressive activities that disregarded international law.

However, Slim also said that the U-2 aircraft incident "should not be regarded as an act of aggression," and that he "did not find any aggression at all" in this matter.

Ceylon representative Claude Corea said that as a member of the United Nations, Ceylon believed that the territorial integrity and sovereignty of every country (whether large or small) were sacred and inviolable, guaranteed not only by the UN Charter, but also recognized as principles. Respect for these fundamental rights is absolutely necessary for maintaining peace among nations. He emphasized that the violation of the airspace of a sovereign state is also a gross violation of international law. He said, therefore, we firmly oppose any attempt to disregard international agreements and international law, regardless of the reasons.

Corea pointed out that such flights exacerbate international tensions and pose a threat to universal peace. He expressed deep "regret" over the incident. He said we unreservedly disapprove of this or any similar flights.

At the same time, Corea said that Eisenhower's statement that he had ordered the cessation of such flights "should be considered satisfactory," and he asked the Soviet Union to "feel satisfied and accept" the US President's statement.

Ecuadorian representative José Correa said in his speech that he "completely disagreed" with the claim that the US U-2 spy plane "had aggressive intentions".

The Security Council will hold two meetings on the 26th. Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko is scheduled to speak at the morning meeting, after which a vote will be taken on the Soviet proposal.

    安理会讨论美机侵苏
    美国代表在幕后进行活动企图使讨论对自己有利
    新华社26日讯　纽约消息：联合国安全理事会在25日的会议上实际上结束了对于美国军用飞机对苏联进行侵略行动，因而对普遍和平造成威胁的问题的讨论。
    美国代表团在会内和幕后进行了许多活动，企图使讨论转向对美国有利的方面，并且转移舆论对美国所奉行的危险的挑衅性政策的注意。一些非常任理事国的代表在发言中一方面表示对美国政府的这种政策感到不安，并且在不同程度上谴责了美国飞机在别国领空进行的间谍飞行同时，他们又在不同程度上设法为美国开脱罪责，没有勇气支持苏联的谴责美国飞机的侵略行动的提案。
    突尼斯代表蒙吉·斯陵指出，他的国家不能认为侵犯主权国家领空的行为是正当的，不管它有什么理由。他说，安全理事会的成员国们都知道，突尼斯的领空屡次遭受不顾国际法而进行侵略活动的军用飞机的侵犯。
    但是，斯陵又说，U—2飞机事件“无论如何不能被认为是一种侵略行动”，他说，他在这个问题上“根本没有发现什么侵略”。
    锡兰代表克劳德·科里亚说，作为联合国的会员国，锡兰认为，每个国家（不论大国或小国）的领土完整和主权是神圣不可侵犯的，它不仅得到联合国宪章的保障，而且这些原则是公认的。尊重这些基本权利对维护各国之间的和平是绝对必需的。他着重指出，对一个主权国家的领空的侵犯也是对国际法的粗暴破坏。他说，因此，我们坚决反对无视国际协议和国际法的任何企图，不管有什么理由。
    科里亚指出，这种飞行，会加剧国际紧张局势，并且是对普遍和平的威胁。他对发生的事件表示深感“遗憾。”他说，我们毫无保留地不赞同这种或另一些类似的飞行。
    同时，科里亚又说，艾森豪威尔关于他已经下令停止这种飞行的声明“应当认为是令人满意的”，他要求苏联对美国总统的这个声明
  “感到满意而加以接受”。
    厄瓜多尔代表何塞·科里亚在发言中说他“完全不同意”关于美国U—2间谍飞机“具有侵略意图的说法”。
    安理会26日将举行两次会议。苏联外交部长葛罗米柯预定在上午会议上发言，在他发言以后将对苏联的提案进行表决。
