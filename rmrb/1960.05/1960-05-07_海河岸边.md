    Beside the Hai River
    Yang Zhaoxun, People's Commune of Xiaozhan, Tianjin

    The Hai River flows gently. In the distance, come the sounds of laughter and songs of triumph over drought from the people digging water farms; on the bank, two large wooden boats are moored steadily.

    People are busy. Some are harvesting greens in the fields, others are carrying the harvested greens to the bank in baskets, loading them onto the large wooden boats. People are working non-stop, talking about how many delicious dishes and palatable soups the greens they are loading onto the boats will make in the city's employee cafeterias, and how well the worker brothers will eat, how much energy they will have, and how high the production will be... People's hearts seem to be going to the city together with the greens they have carefully cultivated. People are immersed in joy, talking and laughing, like a flock of magpies.

    After a while, two more large wooden boats row over from a distance. The people loading vegetables onto the boats are impatiently asking the people on the boats, even before the two boats dock and come to a stop, if the diesel engines ordered from the city have been transported; the people harvesting the greens, even though they are still some distance from the riverbank, seeing the two wooden boats rowing over, are also a few young people running over anxiously to inquire. It turns out that the commune ordered a batch of diesel engines from the city to combat drought and spring planting, and this large wooden boat set off yesterday to the city to transport these machines. The boat slowly and steadily comes to a stop here. Old Man Yu on the boat, in his booming voice, says that all the machines ordered by the commune have been transported. The people on the shore are in an uproar, all flocking to see the new machines. No one sees Little Tian jumping like a flying thing onto the newly docked boat, fiddling with the straw bales, looking at the diesel engines in their packaging...

    Suddenly, Little Tian finds a small piece of paper in the straw bales packaging the diesel engine. As if she has made some major discovery, without waiting for anyone to speak, she bounces and jumps, and with her voice loud, she starts reading to the people:

    "Dear peasant brothers! Our factory has never manufactured diesel engines before. This time, under the leadership of the Party, in order to support agricultural drought resistance, we rushed to produce these machines. If there are any shortcomings or problems with these machines, please write to us in a timely manner, and we will definitely take the time to help you solve them... Sincerely, all the workers of the Assembly Workshop of the Power Plant."

    As soon as Little Tian finishes reading, the people on the shore spontaneously burst into applause...

    People, harvesting greens, loading boats, are working even harder. Laughter rings out everywhere.

    The Hai River flows gently. The boats moored on the shore are heavy, drawing deep in the water! Because the boats are full of such profound friendship!

    海河岸边
    天津小站人民公社　杨兆勋
    海河，潺潺地流水。远处，传来挖养水场的人们的说笑声，和抗旱胜天的歌声；岸边，稳稳的停着两只大木船。
    人们忙个不停。有的在田里收青菜，有的用夹筐把收下的青菜抬到岸上，装到大木船上，人们不停地干活，嘴里谈论着手里的青菜装在船上，运到市里，在职工食堂里会做出多少种美味的菜，可口的汤，工人兄弟们吃得好，会干劲多大，产量多高……。人们的心，仿佛要随着他们精心耕种的青菜，一起进到市里去。人们浸沉在愉快里，说着，笑着，活像一群喜鹊。
    一会儿，从远处又划过来两只大木船。岸上，往船上装菜的人，还没等这两只船靠岸，停稳，就迫不及待地问船上的人，从市里订购的柴油机可运来了；收青菜的人，尽管离河岸还有一段距离，但一见这两只木船划过来，还是有几个年青人心急得跑过来打听。原来，公社为了抗旱春播，在市里订购了一批柴油机，这只大木船是昨天启程到市里去运这些机器的。船，慢慢的稳稳的停在这里了。船上的于老大爷，放开铜锣嗓音，说社里订购的机器全运来了。岸上的人轰动了，都蜂拥上来看新机器。没人看见，小田姑娘早飞一样跳到刚停下的船上，拨拉着草包，看包装着的柴油机……。
    忽然，小田姑娘在包装着柴油机的草包里，发现一个字纸条儿。她像有了什么重大发现一样，没等人说，她就蹦着跳着，放开嗓子给人们念起来：
    “亲爱的农民兄弟们！我们这个厂从来没制造过柴油机，这次在党的领导下，为了支援农业抗旱，我们赶制了这些机器，这些机器有什么缺点或者毛病，请您及时写信来，我们一定抽时间去帮助您解决……。动力厂成装车间全体职工启。”
    小田姑娘刚一念完，岸上的人们就不约而同的鼓起掌来……。
    人们，收青菜的，装船的，干得更起劲了。遍地朗朗的笑声。
    海河，潺潺地流水。停在岸边的船，沉甸甸的，吃水多深！因为船上满载着多么深厚的友谊啊！
