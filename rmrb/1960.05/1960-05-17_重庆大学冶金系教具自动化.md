In the technical revolution movement, the Department of Metallurgy at Chongqing University has focused on the mechanization and automation of laboratories. They have completed 45 innovations, including industrial analysis automation, rapid specific gravity determination of refractory materials, and precision measurement automation.

Originally, the determination of inclusions in steel in the steelmaking laboratory required 48 hours per sample, which affected teaching and research work. Now, through joint research and innovation by teachers and students, using intensified electrolysis measures, the experimental time has been shortened to 4 hours. They have also innovated 19 experiments, generally shortening the time, speeding up the teaching progress, and improving the accuracy of the experiments.

    重庆大学冶金系教具自动化
    重庆大学冶金系在技术革命运动中，大抓实验室的机械化自动化工作。现已完成工业分析自动化、耐火材料做比重快速测定、精度测量自动化等革新四十五项。
    原来炼钢实验室钢中夹杂的测定，做一个试样需要四十八小时，影响教学和科研工作；现在，经师生共同研究革新，运用强化电解的措施，使实验时间缩短为四小时。他们还对十九个实验进行了革新，普遍缩短时间，加快了教学进度，并提高了实验的准确性。
