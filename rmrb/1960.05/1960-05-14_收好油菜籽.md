    Harvest Rapeseed Well
    It is currently the season for harvesting rapeseed. This year, more rapeseed has been planted and it is growing well. In some areas in the South where harvesting has already begun, yields are higher than last year. In the past, harvesting rapeseed was often done crudely, and transportation and threshing were not timely, resulting in losses due to scattering and spoilage, often reaching around 10%, and in some cases, 20%-30%. To truly achieve a bumper harvest, we must ensure that all rapeseed is brought in.
    Harvesting rapeseed must be done at the right time. When rapeseed is ripe, the pods often crack and the seeds fall out. Harvesting too late will cause losses due to the pods bursting. Harvesting too early, before it is fully mature, will reduce yield and oil extraction rate. It is best to harvest as soon as it is ripe, harvesting each part as it ripens. The rapeseed harvesting season coincides with the plum rain season in the Yangtze River basin. If it is cut but not transported back in time, or transported back but not threshed quickly, it may sprout and spoil. Therefore, it should be harvested quickly, transported quickly, and threshed quickly; reaping, transporting, and threshing should be done simultaneously.
    To promptly bring in the bumper rapeseed harvest, we must prepare sufficient harvesting, transportation, and threshing tools. Old tools should be improved, and insufficient equipment should be expanded. For example, some paddy field areas do not have drying grounds, and some places still use sticks or flails for threshing. This situation cannot meet the requirements of a large bumper harvest, and we should find ways to implement tool reforms as soon as possible.
    The central issue in harvesting rapeseed well is the rational allocation of labor. In areas where rapeseed is concentrated, harvesting rapeseed must be carried out simultaneously with rice transplanting, and the labor force is quite strained. Therefore, in addition to vigorously carrying out tool reforms to improve labor productivity, the labor force must also be uniformly arranged. According to the size and time of the harvesting and planting tasks, divide the battle lines, specialize in division of labor, and ensure that the harvesting and planting tasks are completed simultaneously.
    While seizing a complete victory in this year's rapeseed harvest, we must also prepare for next year's bumper harvest. During the harvest season, we must carefully summarize the experience of increasing rapeseed production. In recent years, although the unit yield of rapeseed has continued to increase, the increase is not fast enough compared to other crops. The average yield of rapeseed per mu in most provinces and regions has not exceeded 100 jin. During the harvest season, it is easier to see the reasons for high and low yields, find ways to increase production, and summarize practical experiences. Some preparations for next year's rapeseed production, such as the selection and retention of improved varieties, should also be done during this period.
    Rapeseed acreage accounts for about one-third of the total oil crop acreage. Harvesting rapeseed well plays a significant role in increasing the production of edible and industrial vegetable oils. We must attach as much importance to rapeseed harvesting as we do to wheat harvesting, make all preparations as early as possible, and ensure the victorious completion of this task.

### 收好油菜籽

    收好油菜籽
    当前正是收获油菜的季节。今年油菜种得多，长得好。南方已经开始收获的部分地区，产量都比去年高。过去收获油菜，由于工作粗糙、运输脱粒不及时，抛撒霉烂造成的损失，常达10％左右，多的达到20％—30％。为了真正作到丰产丰收，一定要把油菜全部收到手里。
    收获油菜必须适时。油菜熟了，常常裂荚掉粒，收得过迟，油荚炸裂，会造成损失；收得过早，还没有完全成熟，又会降低产量和出油率。最好是熟了就收，熟一块收一块。油菜收获时期，正是长江流域的黄梅雨季，如果割了不及时运回，运回不很快脱粒，就可能发芽霉烂。因此应该快收、快运、快打；边收割、边运输、边脱粒。
    为了及时把丰产的油菜收回来，要准备足够的收割、运输、脱粒工具。旧工具要加以改革，不敷应用的设备要加以扩充。比如，有些水田地区没有晒场，有些地方还用棍棒或连耞脱粒，这种情况不能适应大丰收的要求，应该及早想办法实行工具改革。
    收好油菜的中心问题是合理安排劳力。在油菜集中的产区，收获油菜要跟插秧同时并进，劳动力是相当紧张的。因此，除了大力进行工具改革提高劳动生产率外，对劳动力还必须加以统一的安排，根据收、种任务的大小，时间的先后，划分战线，专业分工，保证收种任务同时完成。
    在夺取今年油菜全胜的同时，还要为明年大丰收作准备。在收获季节，要很好地总结油菜增产经验。几年来，油菜单位产量虽然不断提高，但比起别的作物，增产还不够快。大部省、区油菜籽的每亩平均产量还没有超过百斤。在收获季节，比较容易看出高产、低产的原因，找出增产的办法，总结出切实可行的经验。明年生产油菜的某些准备工作，如良种的选留，也要在这个时期做好。
    油菜面积占全部油料作物面积的三分之一左右，把油菜收好，对增产食用和工业用植物油有很大作用。我们要像重视麦收一样重视油菜收获工作，及早做好一切准备，保证这一任务胜利完成。
