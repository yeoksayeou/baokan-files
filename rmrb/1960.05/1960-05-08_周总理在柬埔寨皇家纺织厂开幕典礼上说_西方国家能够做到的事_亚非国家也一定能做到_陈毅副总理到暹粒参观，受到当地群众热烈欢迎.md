Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, 7th - Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi, along with Premier Zhou Enlai's other accompanying personnel, left Phnom Penh by plane this morning for Kampong Cham to attend the symbolic opening ceremony of the Cambodian Royal Textile Factory in Kampong Cham.

After this, Premier Zhou Enlai will visit Kompong Som, and Vice Premier Chen Yi will go to Siem Reap to visit the famous sights there.

Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, 7th - Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi, accompanied by Prince Sihanouk, arrived in Kampong Cham by plane at 8:00 a.m. today to attend the symbolic opening ceremony of the Cambodian Royal Textile Factory, which was built with Chinese assistance.

Warmly welcoming the Chinese guests at the airport were Cambodian First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Planning, Nhiek Tioulong, Speaker of the National Assembly, Sisowath Watchayavong, other senior officials of the Royal Government, and local officials.

The Chinese Premier and Vice Premier were adorned with garlands and inspected the guard of honor at the airport.

Today, approximately 40,000 people from all parts of Kampong Cham Province welcomed the distinguished Chinese guests at the airport and along the roads leading to the textile factory. When Premier Zhou Enlai and Prince Sihanouk passed by in cars, the welcoming crowds shouted: "Long live Sino-Cambodian friendship!"

Speaking at the opening ceremony of the Cambodian Royal Textile Factory, First Deputy Prime Minister Nhiek Tioulong said that this factory, like other factories built with Chinese economic aid, is a symbol of the great brotherly friendship linking the people of the People's Republic of China and the people of the Kingdom of Cambodia. It is also the fruit of peaceful cooperation between the workers of the two countries. He expressed his deep conviction that this sincere and friendly cooperation will help to consolidate the friendship between Cambodia and China.

In his speech, Premier Zhou Enlai emphasized that the completion of the Kampong Cham textile factory not only demonstrates the determination of the Cambodian people, under the leadership of Prince Sihanouk, to develop their own national industry, but also demonstrates the ability of the Cambodian people to develop their own national industry. He continued, the people of China and Cambodia are determined to build our countries step by step by relying on our own hardworking hands and on mutually beneficial cooperation with friendly countries. He emphasized that what Western countries can do, we Asian and African countries can certainly do. He added that China's assistance to Cambodia is still extremely limited; it only demonstrates a little bit of the Chinese people's goodwill toward the Cambodian people.

He pointed out that the establishment of the Kampong Cham textile factory mainly relied on the efforts of the Cambodian people themselves.

Premier Zhou Enlai then cut the ribbon amidst the prolonged cheers and applause of approximately 10,000 people attending the opening ceremony. Subsequently, Premier Zhou Enlai and Prince Sihanouk toured the factory together for a week.

The Cambodian workers of the textile factory demonstrated the operation of the machines for the distinguished Chinese guests and presented each distinguished Chinese guest with a piece of white cloth, which was the first batch of products produced by the Cambodian workers of this textile factory.

The construction of this textile factory began in March of last year. When the textile factory is fully completed and put into production, it will be able to produce 8,400 bales of cotton yarn and 5.2 million meters of cotton cloth annually. The textile factory has 11,800 spindles and 210 automatic looms.

Also attending the opening ceremony today were National Assembly Chairman Chuop Hell, members of the diplomatic corps, and Chinese experts.

Xinhua News Agency, Siem Reap, 7th - Vice Premier Chen Yi, accompanied by General Lon Nol, Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces, arrived in Siem Reap at 1:00 p.m. local time today. Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu of China arrived with him.

Welcoming them at the airport were Siem Reap Provincial Governor Hou Hong and hundreds of people. Three Cambodian girls presented Vice Premier Chen Yi with garlands.

After inspecting the guard of honor, Vice Premier Chen Yi, accompanied by General Lon Nol, traveled by car to the Royal Residence, along the way several thousand people welcomed the distinguished Chinese guests and cheered them. Many places hung banners with slogans reading "Welcome His Excellency Zhou Enlai," "Welcome His Excellency Chen Yi," and "Long Live Sino-Cambodian Friendship."

Xinhua News Agency, Siem Reap, 7th - Vice Premier Chen Yi and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, accompanied by General Lon Nol, Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces, and Siem Reap Provincial Governor Hou Hong, visited the famous Angkor monuments this afternoon at 4:00 p.m. local time - a group of magnificent stone temples built between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries.

Lon Nol personally explained the stories about these buildings to the Chinese guests and pointed out to them several beautiful reliefs in the one-kilometer-long corridors.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that the Angkor monuments are very magnificent and wonderful. He said to General Lon Nol that there is only one Angkor in the world, which proves that the Cambodian nation had a very high culture in the past and was very powerful, because only in this way could they build such magnificent buildings. He pointed out that although the glory of ancient times has passed, a new era has come to Cambodia under the leadership of Prince Sihanouk.

When Vice Premier Chen Yi walked out of the last inner gate of the Angkor monuments, members of the Khmer Royal Socialist Youth League standing on the stone road leading to the entrance enthusiastically cheered him. Students shouted: "Long Live Cambodian-Chinese Friendship!" Vice Premier Chen Yi expressed his gratitude to the Cambodian youth and said in Khmer: "Long Live Prince Sihanouk."

Several hundred people waiting at the entrance, including overseas Chinese from Siem Reap Province, warmly applauded and cheered Vice Premier Chen Yi's party.

The Chinese guests visited there for three hours.

At 8:30 p.m., the Governor of Siem Reap Province held a banquet for Vice Premier Chen Yi.

    周恩来总理在讲话时强调指出，磅湛纺织厂的建成，不仅说明柬埔寨人民在西哈努克亲王的领导下，有发展自己民族工业的决心，而且也说明了柬埔寨人民有发展自己民族工业的能力。他继续说，中柬两国人民决心依靠我们自己勤劳的双手，依靠友好国家的互助合作，一步一步地把我们的国家建设起来。他强调说，西方国家能够做到的事，我们亚非国家也一定能够做到。他接着说，中国对柬埔寨的帮助还是极其有限的，它只是表明了中国人民对于柬埔寨人民的一点心意。
