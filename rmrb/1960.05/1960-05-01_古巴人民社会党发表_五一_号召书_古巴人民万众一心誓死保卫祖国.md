Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 29th. The Cuban People's Socialist Party's "May Day" appeal, published in "Hoy" on the 28th, points out that "since January 1, 1959, and especially now, 'May Day' has acquired new characteristics." "It is now a fighting festival for all working people of Cuba, a day to review revolutionary forces and the nation's firm unity around the revolutionary regime—a regime based primarily on the worker-peasant alliance."

The appeal further states that "everywhere in Cuba, 'new shoots of a new society' are sprouting, and Cuba is advancing toward the permanent eradication of the despicable exploitation of man by man, and the transformation of this sacred land into a rich and happy motherland."

The appeal states, "The social conditions of the country are changing, and therefore, the responsibilities of the working class are also changing. The working class's paramount slogan now is to defend the motherland to the death!" The appeal emphasizes, "The enemies of Cuba must know that (Cuba) will never become another Guatemala; they will find their grave here! Down with the invaders!"

The appeal points out that the imperialist enemies and all counter-revolutionaries are doing their utmost to create chaos and division among the people. May 1st will be a powerful rebuff to those who create chaos and divisions, a fervent manifestation of the spirit of unity and cooperation among our people, and a firm reflection of the determination to resist the enemy and achieve victory.

The appeal also states, "At the same time, this year's 'May Day' will become a noble expression of international support for the Cuban Revolution. From far and near, we are brought such needed encouragement and assurances that we will never feel isolated in the decisive battle."

The appeal further states that the People's Socialist Party is a militant force that has attracted the enemy's main firepower over the past thirty-five years. The People's Socialist Party calls on the working masses, including the well-to-do in the middle class, national industrialists and merchants, and all those who objectively desire progress for the motherland, to place the interests of the threatened motherland above all else, and to strengthen the power of the revolutionary regime. Not to continue forward is to regress to the miserable system of colonial enslavement!

The appeal concludes with "May Day" slogans, including: urban and rural workers must increase the quantity and quality of products and increase labor productivity; strengthen the various farmers' associations and mobilize them to become the most effective assistants to the National Agrarian Reform Institute in implementing land reform and developing the peasant cooperative movement; strengthen the worker-peasant militia and the people's militia; down with U.S. imperialism, which is invading our motherland!

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 28th. These days, the whole of Havana is immersed in a pre-festival atmosphere. The main slogan for the Cuban people's commemoration of "May Day" this year, "Defend the Motherland to the Death," is prominently displayed on every street in Havana. Over one million people will gather in the Plaza Cívica on "May Day." This gathering will be a powerful demonstration and political mobilization in the struggle to defend and advance the Cuban Revolution and to oppose U.S. interference.

The Cuban Workers' Confederation's statement for "May Day" says that Cuban workers and the entire people are determined to fight against imperialist aggression and to defend the Cuban Revolution "until the last drop of blood is shed."

"May Day" preparatory activities have turned into a nationwide political mobilization to defend the revolution. The militia are stepping up drills to participate in the parade. Almost every factory has held mobilization meetings. Since the 26th, a series of televised meetings have been held here, in which the working people expressed their determination to support the policies of the revolutionary government, to support land reform, and to advance the revolution. They responded with firm refutations to Eisenhower's slanders against the Cuban Revolution. Brewery worker Rodriguez said that all of our brewery workers and our families will participate in the grand "May Day" rally, "in order to prove that the whole country supports the revolution and to let counter-revolutionaries at home and abroad know that in factories and militia ranks, we have mobilized and are determined to defend every street, every house, and every palm tree under the slogan of 'Defend the Motherland to the Death.'"

This year's "May Day" celebrations will demonstrate the solidarity and mutual support between the Cuban people and the people of all countries in the world who are fighting against imperialism and for national independence. It is expected that more than 1,000 people from Latin American countries and guests from other parts of the world will participate in the celebration. In addition, militia units from some Latin American countries will march side-by-side with the Cuban people. Their arrival will prove that the whole world supports Cuba.

Xinhua News Agency, 30th. On the eve of the "May Day" International Labor Day, the people of Latin American countries have further expressed their firm support for the Cuban Revolution.

In Rio de Janeiro, the Brazil-Cuba Friendship Association held a rally on the evening of the 27th at the Brazilian Press Association to support the Cuban Revolution. Speakers at the meeting listed the many achievements made by the Cuban people under the leadership of the Cuban revolutionary government, and condemned the imperialist propaganda campaign attacking the Cuban Revolution. They pointed out that the fate of the Cuban Revolution is linked to the fate of all countries struggling for national liberation.

Brazilian nationalist Congressman, Cotinho Cavalcanthi, a member of the presidium of the Brazil-Cuba Friendship Association, emphasized that the Cuban people are fighting for national liberation and against U.S. trusts.

At the end of the meeting, a letter signed by Abir Silmonte, Chairman of the Brazilian National Peace Council, was read out, expressing support for the Cuban people's struggle for peace and condemning the U.S. imperialist bombing of Cuba. The letter will be taken to the Cuban people by two congressmen from the Nationalist Parliamentary Front who are about to visit Cuba.

In Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay, a mass rally was held in support of Venezuela and Cuba. Speakers at the meeting included members of both houses of the Uruguayan parliament. Communist Congressman Rodriguez, in his speech, condemned the overthrown Venezuelan dictator Pérez Jiménez and the Cuban dictator Batista for attempting to restore dictatorial regimes in these countries with the help of U.S. reactionary groups. Socialist Senator Cardoso pointed out that the revolutions in Cuba and Venezuela are of great significance to all countries on the continent and called on all countries in Latin America to support the people of Cuba and Venezuela.

In Costa Rica, trade union organizations with various tendencies jointly signed a "May Day" Labor Day declaration on the 28th, stating that on this year's "May Day," people will demonstrate their firm will to support the Cuban Revolution.

    号召书指出，帝国主义敌人和一切反革命分子竭力企图制造混乱和分裂人民。5月1日将是对制造混乱的分子和分裂主义分子的有力回击，将热烈地体现出来我国人民团结合作的精神以及坚定地反映出来抗击敌人和取得胜利的决心。

    古巴工人联合会为“五一”节发表的声明说，古巴工人和全体人民决心为反对帝国主义侵略，保卫古巴革命而斗争，“直到流尽最后一滴血”。
