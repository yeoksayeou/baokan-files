Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, 22nd. Workers at the Victory Mine in Fushun Coal Mine, which has the longest history and suffered the most from Japanese imperialism, held a rally on the 21st to firmly support the Japanese people in overthrowing the aggressive Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty.

From 1911, when Japanese imperialism ruled the Victory Mine, to the "August 15th" liberation in 1945, the mine's workers waged an unyielding struggle against the Japanese imperialists for thirty-four years. Therefore, the miners are particularly concerned about the heroic struggle of the Japanese people, especially the Japanese working class, against the revival of Japanese militarism. Qin Baorui, who participated in the Shicaiyuanzi Riot against Japanese fascist aggression, said: "In 1941, the Japanese fascists carried out a 'Great Mopping-up' in the Taihang Mountains,砍死斩了我的父亲和母亲，俘了我们参加抗日斗争的人后不当人待; kidnapped and mistreated those of us who participated in the anti-Japanese struggle; one year I suffered from typhoid fever for half a month, and the Japanese fascists wanted to put me in a coffin and bury me alive, but fortunately my partner rescued me." He said angrily: "I will never forget the Japanese fascists' invasion of our country. We firmly stand with the Japanese people and support the Japanese people in overthrowing Japanese militarism and overturning the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty!" Park Myung-soo, a Korean female worker from the electromechanical plant, said at a rally: "The doomsday of the American and Japanese reactionaries has arrived, and their wolf-like faces are becoming more and more exposed. Only when the people of the world unite and overthrow imperialism will there be true peace."

Li Liangui, an old miner who escaped death from the Pingdingshan Massacre created by the Japanese fascists, said angrily: "Pingdingshan was once a very prosperous town in Fushun City, with a population of more than 3,000 people in 1,000 households. On the Mid-Autumn Festival night in 1932, the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army attacked the Fushun mining area, killing more than a dozen Japanese guards and burning down the Japanese devils' warehouses and shops, giving the Chinese people, who had been oppressed by the Japanese fascists for many years, a chance to vent their anger. After the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army left, the Japanese fascist thugs collectively killed more than 3,000 men, women, old and young people under Pingdingshan on the charge of 'collaborating with bandits' and burned down all 700 houses in the village." He said with extreme hatred: "I hate Japanese militarism to the core." He expressed his determination to resolutely oppose American imperialism's revival of Japanese militarism and to resolutely support the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle.

    抚顺煤矿工人怒斥美日反动派
    朝鲜族女工说只有打倒帝国主义才会有真正的和平
    据新华社抚顺22日电　抚顺煤矿历史最长、受日本帝国主义摧残最深的胜利矿职工，21日举行集会，坚决支持日本人民推翻侵略性的日美军事同盟条约。
    从1911年日本帝国主义统治胜利矿到1945年“八一五”光复，这个矿的工人在三十四年间向日本帝国主义者进行了不屈不挠的斗争。因此，矿工们特别关怀日本人民、尤其是日本工人阶级反对复活日本军国主义的英勇斗争。曾经参加过事菜园子大暴动，反对日本法西斯侵略的秦宝瑞说：“1941年日本法西斯在太行山区进行‘大扫荡’，砍死了我的父亲和母亲，俘了我们参加抗日斗争的人后不当人待；有一年我害了半个月的伤寒病，日本法西斯就要把我装进棺材里活埋，幸亏我的伙伴把我救出来了。”他气愤地说：“我永远不会忘记日本法西斯对我国的侵略。我们坚决和日本人民站在一起，支持日本人民打倒日本军国主义，推翻日美军事同盟条约！”机电场朝鲜族女工朴明树在一次集会上说：“美日反动派的末日到了，他们恶狼般的面目越来越暴露无遗。只有全世界人民团结起来，打倒帝国主义，才会有真正的和平。”
    从日本法西斯制造的平顶山大惨案中死里逃生的老矿工李连贵愤怒地说：“平顶山当年是抚顺市一个很繁华的市镇，全镇一千户人家、三千多人口。1932年的中秋节晚上，抗日义勇军攻进了抚顺矿区，打死了十几名日本守备队员，焚毁了日本鬼子的仓库和商店，替受日本法西斯欺压多年的中国人出了口气。抗日义勇军走后，日本法西斯暴徒就以‘通匪’的罪名，把平顶山下三千多名男女老幼集体杀掉，把全村七百多栋房子全部烧掉。”他万分痛恨地说：“我恨透了日本军国主义。”他表示要坚决反对美帝国主义复活日本军国主义，坚决支持日本人民的爱国正义斗争。（附图片）
