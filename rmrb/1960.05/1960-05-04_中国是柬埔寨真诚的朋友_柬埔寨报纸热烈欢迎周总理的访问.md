Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, 3rd: Cambodian newspapers warmly welcome Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai's upcoming visit to Cambodia.

    "L'Observateur" wrote today, "When the Chinese Premier makes his second contact with Cambodian land and people on May 5th, a very warm welcome will be waiting for him."

    The newspaper recounted the history of traditional friendship between China and Cambodia and then said: "Despite the differences in our social and political systems, the relations between our two countries have never been as close as they are today." It pointed out that the common basis of the friendship between the two countries is that both sides abide by the Bandung spirit and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. It said that China is "one of the best friends of the neutral Kingdom of Cambodia."

    The newspaper pointed out that, based on history and the situation in recent years, China's friendship is of great benefit to the Cambodian people. At very critical moments, at times when Cambodia encountered threats from neighboring countries and SEATO countries, China has always opposed subversive and aggressive attempts aimed at making Cambodia abandon its neutral policy. The newspaper also said, "We can say that China's friendship has always been a factor in our stable maintenance of neutrality."

    An editorial published by "Amitie" analyzed in detail who Cambodia's real friends are. It said, "When the imperialists and their servants pointed their spearheads at us, it was China that stood by Cambodia to defend it. Therefore, China is a sincere friend of Cambodia, and we must welcome this good friend as a good friend."

    "Cambodge Actuelle" wrote in its latest issue, "Mr. Zhou Enlai must know that he will be received here as a sincere friend. There are no serious problems between his country and ours." It said that the friendship between China and Cambodia is one of the pillars of our country's neutral policy.

    It also said, "China, which plays such an important role in Asia and is constantly growing stronger, has always adopted a policy of understanding and peace towards us."

    This publication wrote in a previous issue, "It is gratifying to see the arrival of a representative of a great power at a time when our country is facing obvious threats." It said that this is "a reminder to everyone that Cambodia is not isolated."

    中国是柬埔寨真诚的朋友
    柬埔寨报纸热烈欢迎周总理的访问
    新华社金边3日电　柬埔寨报纸热烈欢迎中国总理周恩来即将访问柬埔寨。
    “观察家报”今天写道，“当中国总理5月5日同柬埔寨的国土和人民第二次接触的时候，将有非常热烈的欢迎在等待着他”。
    报纸追述了中柬两国传统友谊的历史以后说：“尽管我们的社会制度和政治制度不同，我们两国的关系从来没有像今天这么亲密。”它指出，两国友谊的共同基础是双方遵循万隆精神以及和平共处的五项原则。它说，中国是“中立的柬埔寨王国最好的朋友之一”。
    这家报纸指出，根据历史和最近几年的情况来看，中国的友谊对柬埔寨人民来说是有很大的好处的。在非常严重的时刻，在柬埔寨遭遇到邻国和东南亚条约组织国家的威胁的时刻，中国总是反对旨在使柬埔寨放弃中立政策的颠覆和侵略企图。报纸又说，“我们可以说，中国的友谊一直是我们稳定地保持中立的因素。”
    “友谊报”发表的社论详细分析了谁是柬埔寨的真正朋友。它说，“当帝国主义者和他们的仆从把矛头指向我们的时候，站在柬埔寨旁边保卫它的正是中国。因此，中国是柬埔寨真诚的朋友，我们必须把这个好朋友当作好朋友来欢迎。”
    “柬埔寨现状”周刊在最近一期写道，“周恩来先生想必知道，他在这里将受到像接待真诚的朋友那样的接待。他的国家和我国之间不存在严重的问题。”它说，中国和柬埔寨的友谊是我国的中立政策支柱之一。
    它还说，“在亚洲起着那么重要作用并且正在不断壮大的中国，对我们始终采取谅解和和平的政策”。
    这家刊物在前一期中写道，“正当我国受到明显的威胁的时候，看到一个大国的代表的莅临，这是令人欣慰的”。它说，这是“提醒大家、柬埔寨不是孤立的”。
