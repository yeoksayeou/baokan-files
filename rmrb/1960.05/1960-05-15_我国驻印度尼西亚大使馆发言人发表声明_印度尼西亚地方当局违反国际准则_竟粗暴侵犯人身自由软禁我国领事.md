The incident and the "Da Baokang" ship incident are absolutely not accidental. Obviously, some people are intentionally creating incidents, poisoning the atmosphere, obstructing the return of overseas Chinese to China, and undermining relations between the two countries.
The Embassy of the People's Republic of China has clearly stated its firm and just position on these two serious incidents to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 13th: The spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia held a press conference here this afternoon, issuing a statement on the serious incident of the military authorities in Samarinda forcibly placing Jiang Yan, the Chinese Consul in Marchen, under house arrest. The full text of the statement is as follows:

The spokesperson of the Embassy of the People's Republic of China in the Republic of Indonesia issues the following statement regarding the serious incident in East Kalimantan Province where the military authorities in Samarinda forcibly placed Jiang Yan, the Chinese Consul in Marchen, under house arrest on April 27, obstructed the Consul from performing his normal duties, rudely infringing on the Consul's personal freedom, and obstructing overseas Chinese from returning to their homeland:

As you know, the government of the People's Republic of China dispatched the "Haihuang" ship to Samarinda to transport overseas Chinese from various parts of East Kalimantan Province who had lost their livelihoods due to forced relocation and the impact of Decree No. 10 back to China. This ship arrived in Samarinda on April 26. On the same day, Jiang Yan, the Consul of the People's Republic of China in Marchen, also arrived in Samarinda from Balikpapan. Before the arrival of this ship carrying overseas Chinese back to China, the displaced overseas Chinese concentrated in Samarinda had largely completed the procedures for returning to China. On April 27, they began to complete the final procedures, which was to affix fingerprints. According to the agreement reached between Consul Jiang Yan and the local authorities, this procedure should be completed before 4:00 PM, so that the displaced overseas Chinese returning to their homeland could board the ship on that day. However, due to the deliberate delay of personnel from the local prosecutor's office, only over one hundred people had affixed their fingerprints by 5:00 PM, and more than five hundred displaced overseas Chinese were still waiting to affix their fingerprints, including elderly people and children who needed care. Logically, this procedure should have been completed quickly. However, the prosecutor's office unexpectedly announced the suspension of the procedure, which caused great anxiety among all the displaced overseas Chinese. Consul Jiang Yan immediately consulted with Prosecutor Mr. Hamzah, expressing his hope to continue completing the procedures. However, this was also unreasonably rejected. Subsequently, Consul Jiang Yan requested a meeting with Lieutenant Saidi, the wartime authority in Kutai County responsible for handling the return of this group of overseas Chinese, and requested the implementation of the agreed-upon matters and the continued completion of the procedures. Lieutenant Saidi immediately expressed his willingness to go to the Chinese Consul's residence on the same evening for consultation. However, he did not fulfill this appointment. At 6:00 PM, Consul Jiang Yan discovered that his temporary car was suddenly missing. Immediately afterwards, the city's electricity was cut off. Moreover, the local authorities dispatched armed military police around 7:00 PM or shortly thereafter to surround the Chinese School where the displaced overseas Chinese were concentrated waiting to complete the procedures, surround the port, and the residences of local overseas Chinese community leaders. At that time, the whole city was pitch black, sentry posts were everywhere, overseas Chinese were forbidden to meet with Consul Jiang Yan, and telephone contact was blocked (using Chinese to communicate with other places had been banned two days earlier). The atmosphere there became very tense. At the same time, army personnel sent to the port actually set up machine guns, intimidating more than two hundred students who, with the consent of the local authorities, were carrying luggage for the displaced overseas Chinese. The displaced overseas Chinese concentrated in the Chinese School waiting to complete boarding procedures were ordered to leave. At the same time, the military authorities dispatched two armed staff officers to Consul Jiang Yan's residence, conveying the "decision" of Major Mutaji, the wartime authority and commander of the 601st Battalion in the area. This "decision" put forward three unreasonable demands: Consul Jiang Yan must not leave his residence, must not meet with overseas Chinese, and should leave Samarinda before dark on April 28. Subsequently, sentry posts were set up at Consul Jiang Yan's residence, forcibly placing him under house arrest. This house arrest lasted for forty-one hours. At that time, Mr. Lu Yaoda, the group leader of the displaced overseas Chinese returning to their homeland, and Mr. Guan Zhuning (transliteration), who led the students to help the displaced overseas Chinese carry luggage, were unreasonably taken to the military police department for interrogation when they arrived at the Consul's residence to meet with Consul Jiang Yan. Consul Jiang Yan expressed a stern position on this unreasonable action by the military authorities and wrote to Lieutenant Saidi twice, requesting a meeting with him. However, Lieutenant Saidi refused to meet with Consul Jiang Yan. It was not until the morning of April 29 that Lieutenant Saidi went to meet with Consul Jiang Yan with his armed staff officers and said that he was ordered by Major Mutaji, commander of the 601st Battalion, to dispatch armed staff officers to "accompany" Consul Jiang Yan to Balikpapan.

Consul Jiang Yan immediately sternly refused and pointed out that the military authorities' forcible house arrest of the Consul, the rude infringement on the Consul's authority and personal freedom, the obstruction of overseas Chinese returning to their homeland, and the threat to the lives and property of overseas Chinese in Samarinda were extremely serious incidents. Consul Jiang Yan lodged a strong protest against this. After arriving in Balikpapan on April 30, Consul Jiang Yan again lodged a strong protest against these serious incidents to Major Prianto and Major Subagijo, representatives of the military authorities of East Kalimantan Province, and returned to Marchen on May 1.

The spokesperson of the Embassy of the People's Republic of China believes that the incident of forcibly placing Consul Jiang Yan under house arrest in Samarinda is very serious in nature. The Indonesian military authorities in Samarinda's forcible house arrest of Consul Jiang Yan and the rude infringement on the Consul's authority, personal safety, and freedom, the obstruction of overseas Chinese returning to their homeland, and the threat to the lives and property of overseas Chinese not only violate universally recognized international norms and undermine the Indonesian government's repeated promises that it would facilitate the return of overseas Chinese who are willing to return to their homeland, but also constitute an extremely unfriendly act towards the People's Republic of China.

The spokesperson of the Embassy of the People's Republic of China must also point out that the incident of forcibly placing the Consul of the People's Republic of China under house arrest in Samarinda, East Kalimantan Province, and the incident of local military police in Selatpanjang, Riau Province, forcibly detaining the "Da Baokang" ship on April 27 are absolutely not accidental or isolated. As pointed out in the statement issued by the spokesperson of the Consulate General of the People's Republic of China in Jakarta on May 3, the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs had been notified before the People's Republic of China dispatched the "Da Baokang" ship to Selatpanjang, Riau Province, to transport displaced overseas Chinese who had suffered from fire disasters and lost their livelihoods due to the impact of Decree No. 10 back to their homeland. Liu Qingyou, Attache of the Consulate of the People's Republic of China in Medan, was sent to Selatpanjang to take care of this matter. Attache Liu Qingyou conducted smooth consultations and cooperation with the local military and political authorities in Pekanbaru and Selatpanjang on issues such as simplifying procedures and handling departure permits for overseas Chinese. When the "Da Baokang" ship, carrying 702 displaced overseas Chinese, set sail for China, it not only completed all the necessary procedures but also received a formal notification from Mr. Aris, the plenipotentiary representative of the Governor, and only after this did the ship set sail for China. Mr. Harahap, the prosecutor of Riau Province, ordered the prosecutor's office in Selatpanjang to dispatch armed military police to fire at the ship and detain the "Da Baokang" ship on the pretext that the procedures were not completed. This is also unreasonable. Antara News Agency published a statement on May 3 by Mr. Gunawan, the Attorney General of Indonesia, claiming that a Chinese ship quietly escaped from Indonesian territorial waters. This statement is pure fabrication and slander against the People's Republic of China. As everyone knows, after the "Da Baokang" ship arrived in Selatpanjang, Attorney General Gunawan was visiting the oil facilities and oil wells operated by the American Texaco Oil Company near Pekanbaru, Riau Province, around April 26 at the invitation of the company, and was conducting inspections in Riau Province. Mr. Gunawan should have been able to learn about the actual situation of the "Da Baokang" ship sent by the People's Republic of China to Selatpanjang to transport displaced overseas Chinese back to their homeland. The spokesperson of the Embassy of the People's Republic of China would also like to draw your attention to this irrefutable fact: On April 28, the Director of the Selatpanjang Port Authority sent a telegram to the Jakarta Shipping Company. The original text of the telegram is as follows: "'Da Baokang' ship arrived in Selatpanjang on April 24 and departed for Huangpu, Guangzhou on April 27, carrying 700 overseas Chinese." The Jakarta Shipping Company is an Indonesian state-owned company that is responsible for handling all matters related to the arrival and departure of ships sent by the People's Republic of China to transport overseas Chinese from and to Indonesian ports, and the Selatpanjang Port Authority is an Indonesian government agency. This telegram is sufficient to fully prove the following fact: the departure of the "Da Baokang" from Selatpanjang was proper and legal. It is not difficult for a person with a little common sense to judge whether it is possible for an ocean-going vessel like the "Da Baokang," carrying more than 700 overseas Chinese, to "quietly escape" from a port under the strict control of the state machinery of a sovereign country without permission. Isn't this ridiculous?

In the above two incidents, the Indonesian local authorities took violent actions; the first was to forcibly place the Consul of the People's Republic of China under house arrest, and the second was to forcibly detain the ship sent by the People's Republic of China to transport returning overseas Chinese. Moreover, these two serious incidents occurred simultaneously within a period of time. Therefore, they are by no means accidental or isolated incidents. Obviously, some people are intentionally creating incidents, poisoning the atmosphere, obstructing the return of overseas Chinese to China, and undermining relations between the two countries. The Embassy of the People's Republic of China has clearly stated its firm and just position on these two serious incidents to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia.

    我国驻印度尼西亚大使馆发言人发表声明
    印度尼西亚地方当局违反国际准则
    竟粗暴侵犯人身自由软禁我国领事
    这一事件和“大宝康号”轮船事件的发生，绝对不是偶然的。显然，有某些人正在有意制造事件、毒化气氛、阻挠华侨回国、破坏两国的关系。
    中华人民共和国大使馆已经向印度尼西亚共和国外交部清楚地表明了对这两起严重事件的坚定和正义的立场。
    新华社雅加达13日电　中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆发言人今天下午在这里举行记者招待会，就三马林达军事当局强行软禁中国驻马辰领事江燕的严重事件发表声明。声明全文如下：
    中华人民共和国驻印度尼西亚共和国大使馆发言人就东加里曼丹省三马林达军事当局4月27日强行软禁中国驻马辰领事江燕、阻挠这位领事执行正常职务、粗暴侵犯这位领事的人身自由和阻挠华侨返回祖国的严重事件发表下列声明：
    大家知道，中华人民共和国政府派遣了“海皇号”轮船前往三马林达接运东加里曼丹省各地由于遭到迫迁和受到第十号法令的影响而丧失生计的华侨返回中国，这艘轮船在4月26日到达三马林达。同一天，中华人民共和国驻马辰领事江燕也从巴厘巴板到达三马林达。在接运华侨回国的这艘轮船到达以前，集中在三马林达的流离失所的华侨大体上已经办完返回中国的手续。4月27日，他们开始办理最后的手续，那就是按手印。按照江燕领事和当地有关当局之间达成的协议，这种手续应在下午四时以前完成，以使流离失所的归国华侨在那一天可以上船。但是，由于当地检察署人员的有意拖延，到下午五时为止，只有一百多人按完了手印，还有五百多个流离失所的华侨在等待着按手印，其中有需要照顾的老人和小孩。按理，这种手续原来是应该很快办好的。但是，检察署出人意料地宣布停止办理手续，这样就使所有流离失所的华侨感到极大的不安。江燕领事立即同检察官哈姆扎先生进行磋商，表示希望继续办完手续。但是，连这也遭到无理拒绝。随后，江燕领事要求会见负责处理有关这批华侨回国事务的古泰县战时掌权者萨伊迪中尉，并要求履行已经达成协议的事项，以及继续办完手续。萨伊迪中尉当即表示愿意在同一天晚上前往中国领事的住所进行磋商。但是，他没有履行这次约会。下午六时，江燕领事发觉他临时使用的汽车突然不见了。紧接着全城停止供电。而且，地方当局在下午七时或七时过后不久，派遣武装军警包围了流离失所的华侨集中在那里等待办理手续的中华学校，包围了港口和当地华侨团体领导人的住所。当时，全城漆黑，岗哨遍布，华侨被禁止会见江燕领事，电话联系被封锁（用华语同其他地方通电话在两天以前就被禁止了）。那里的气氛变得非常紧张。同时，奉派到港口去的陆军人员竟然架起机关枪，恐吓在地方当局同意下为流离失所的华侨搬运行李的二百多名学生。集中在中华学校等待办理上船手续的流离失所的华侨被命令离开。同时，军事当局派遣两名武装参谋人员前往江燕领事的住所，转达该地区战时掌权者兼第六百零一营营长穆塔季少校的“决定”，在这个“决定”中提出了三项无理要求：江燕领事不得离开他的住所，不得接见华侨，并且应在4月28日天黑以前离开三马林达。随后，在江燕领事的住所设置了哨岗，对他强行软禁，这种软禁持续了四十一小时之久。在那时，流离失所的归国华侨小组长卢耀达先生和率领学生帮助流离失所的华侨搬运行李的关诸宁（译音）先生在到达领事住所要会见江燕领事时，被无理带到宪兵部盘问。江燕领事对军事当局这种无理行动表示了严正的立场，并且两次写信给萨伊迪中尉，要求同他会见。但是，萨伊迪中尉拒不会见江燕领事。直到4月29日上午萨伊迪中尉才带着他的武装参谋人员前往会见江燕领事，并且说，他奉到第六百零一营营长穆塔季少校的命令，派遣武装参谋人员“陪同”江燕领事前往巴厘巴板。
    江燕领事当即严词拒绝，并且指出，军事当局对领事强行软禁、对领事职权和人身自由的粗暴侵犯、对华侨回国的阻挠以及对三马林达华侨生命和财产的威胁是极端严重的事件，江燕领事为此提出了强烈的抗议。江燕领事在4月30日到达巴厘巴板以后，再次就这些严重的事件向东加里曼丹省军事当局的代表普里安托少校和苏巴吉奥少校提出强硬抗议，并且在5月1日返回马辰。
    中华人民共和国大使馆发言人认为，在三马林达发生的强行软禁江燕领事的事件，在性质上是非常严重的。三马林达印度尼西亚军事当局对江燕领事强行软禁以及对这位领事的职权、人身安全和自由的粗暴侵犯，对华侨回国的阻挠，对华侨的生命和财产的威胁，不仅违反了举世公认的国际准则，破坏了印度尼西亚政府所一再宣称的它将给予愿意归国的华侨返回本国以便利的诺言，而且构成对中华人民共和国极不友好的行为。
    中华人民共和国大使馆发言人还必须指出，在东加里曼丹省三马林达强行软禁中华人民共和国领事事件和在廖内省实叻班让当地军警4月27日强行扣留“大宝康号”轮船事件的发生，绝对不是偶然的、孤立的。如中华人民共和国驻雅加达总领事馆发言人在5月3日发表的声明中所指出的，在中华人民共和国派遣“大宝康号”轮船前往廖内省实叻班让接运遭遇火灾和由于第十号法令的影响而丧失生计的流离失所的华侨归国以前，印度尼西亚外交部曾经得到了通知。中华人民共和国驻棉兰领事馆派遣了随习领事刘庆有前往实叻班让照料这件事。刘庆有随习领事就简化手续和办理华侨离境许可手续等问题同北干巴鲁和实叻班让地方军政当局进行了顺利的磋商和合作。当“大宝康号”轮船载运了七百零二名流离失所的华侨启碇前往中国时，它不仅办完了一切必要的手续，并且还得到省长的全权代表阿里斯先生的正式通知，而且只是在这以后，这艘船才启航开赴中国。廖内省检察官哈拉哈普先生命令实叻班让检察署派遣武装军警向这艘船开枪并且借口所谓手续没有办完而将“大宝康号”轮船扣留，这也是毫无道理的。安塔拉通讯社5月3日发表了印度尼西亚最高检察长贡纳万先生所谓中华人民共和国的一艘船只悄然逃离印度尼西亚领海的声明，这个声明是纯粹的捏造和对中华人民共和国的污蔑。大家知道，在“大宝康号”轮船达到实叻班让以后，最高检察长贡纳万先生在4月26日左右应美国德士古石油公司的邀请正在参观廖内省北干巴鲁附近这家石油公司经营的石油设施和油井，并且在廖内省进行视察。贡纳万先生应当有可能获悉中华人民共和国派赴实叻班让接运流离失所的华侨归国的“大宝康号”轮船的实际情况的。中华人民共和国大使馆发言人还愿意提请你们注意这个无可辩驳的事实：4月28日实叻班让港务局长曾经打电报给雅加达轮船公司，这份电报原文如下：“‘大宝康号’轮船4月24日到达实叻班让，4月27日启程前往广州的黄浦，载有七百名华侨”。雅加达轮船公司是一家印度尼西亚的国营公司，它是负责经办中华人民共和国派去接运华侨的船只抵达和离开印度尼西亚港口的一切事务的，而实叻班让港务局是印度尼西亚的一个政府机构。这份电报足以充分证明以下的事实：“大宝康号”驶离实叻班让是正当而合法的。一个稍有一点常识的人不难作出判断像“大宝康号”那样载着七百多名华侨的远洋轮船，是否有可能在未经许可的情况下“悄悄地逃离”在一个主权国家的国家机器严格控制下的港口，这不是很可笑吗？
    在上述两次事件中，印度尼西亚地方当局都采取了暴力；第一起是强行软禁中华人民共和国的领事，第二起是强行扣留中华人民共和国派遣接运归侨的船只，而且，这两起严重事件是在一个时期内同时发生的。因此，它们绝不是偶然的、孤立的事件。显然，有某些人正在有意制造事件、毒化气氛、阻挠华侨归国、破坏两国的关系。中华人民共和国大使馆已经向印度尼西亚共和国外交部清楚地表明了对这两起严重事件的坚定和正义的立场。
