Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, May 23rd. The working people of Bucharest, the capital of Romania, and other major cities such as Constanta, Iasi, Galati, and Târgu Mureș, held rallies on the 23rd to protest the American provocation against the Soviet Union and condemn the American sabotage of the Four-Power Summit.

In Bucharest, workers at the "Republica" factory held a rally with more than two thousand participants on this day. Fitter Morejan said at the meeting that American imperialism had destroyed the summit conference, proving that they insisted on pursuing a policy of the Cold War. The American imperialists should understand that the era of imposing their policies on others is over. The socialist camp, led by the Soviet Union, has enough strength to defeat any attacks by the instigators of a new war. Engineer Gheorghe said at the meeting that American reactionaries do not like the relaxation of the international situation, and they have vilely sabotaged the summit conference. After the Soviet Union sternly exposed the conspiracy of the American reactionaries, Eisenhower and Herter and others announced that the United States would continue to implement this aggressive policy. We resolutely condemn this aggressive policy of the United States. Romanian Academy Academician Condurache also spoke at the meeting. On behalf of the Romanian scientific workers, he expressed strong protest against the aggressive acts of the United States and its policy of destroying the summit conference.

The meeting at the "Republica" factory finally passed a resolution severely condemning the crimes of American imperialism in sabotaging the summit conference, and firmly supporting the solemn position of the Soviet Union. The resolution emphasized that the strength of the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union is invincible and can completely inflict a devastating blow on the reactionary forces that undermine world peace and carry out provocations.

More than 1,500 employees of the "November 7" textile factory in Bucharest also held a rally on the 23rd. The meeting unanimously adopted a resolution stating that the hideous face of American imperialism is now fully exposed before the people of the world. The Romanian people will heighten their vigilance and unremittingly fight against any conspiracies and tricks of the enemies of mankind.

At the rally of teachers and students of the Bucharest Industrial Institute to protest against the crimes of American imperialism, Academician Ticulescu, the president of the institute, said that the US destroyed the summit conference, which proves that American imperialist politicians and generals do not like understanding and friendship between the people of all countries. He said that the US plane violated the Soviet airspace, not as an isolated incident, and its purpose was to undermine the summit conference.

The teachers and students of the Industrial Institute finally passed a resolution condemning the American aggressors. The resolution said: "In the struggle for peace, the people of all countries in the world will be more united and more vigilant. The forces of peace will surely defeat the forces of war."

The rallies of the working people in Constanta, Iasi, Galati, Târgu Mureș and other cities also demonstrated the firm will of the Romanian people to oppose American imperialism and resolutely support the just struggle of the Soviet Union.

    在布加勒斯特工业学院师生举行的抗议美帝国主义罪行的大会上，这个学院的院长丁库列斯库院士讲话说，美国破坏了政府首脑会议，这证明美帝国主义的政客和将军们是不喜欢各国人民之间的谅解和友好的。他说，美国飞机侵犯苏联领空的行动，并不是一个孤立的事件，其目的是为了破坏首脑会议。
    这个工业学院的师生最后通过了谴责美国侵略者的决议。决议中说：“在争取和平的斗争中，世界各国人民将更加团结，更加提高警惕性。和平力量必将战胜战争势力。”
