Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 20th: Seoul Dispatch: Workers and merchants in Seoul, Daegu, and other places continue to hold strikes, market boycotts, and demonstrations to oppose the reactionary rule and cruel exploitation system of the US-Huh Jung group.

　　This afternoon in Seoul, over a hundred taxi drivers held a demonstration, demanding the dissolution of the puppet "Controlled Enterprise Association," demanding the revision of the eighteen-hour work regulation, and demanding the abolition of exploitative intermediary companies.

　　Following the collective market boycott by over four hundred small merchants in Busan on the 18th, today over a hundred small merchants in the western market of Daegu held a market boycott and demonstration. They marched on the streets holding signs reading "Get out, you scoundrel tax collectors!" They demanded that the monthly household registration tax be changed to twice a year, and that each stallholder pay thirty hwan per day instead of sixty hwan.

　　Ninety-two "prisoners" imprisoned in Masan prison by the Syngman Rhee group also engaged in struggle today. They demanded improved treatment. It is reported that other "prisoners" will also respond to their struggle. Puppet authorities dispatched troops to suppress them.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 21st: Seoul Dispatch: South Korean workers, peasants, and merchants continue to launch struggles to expel US-Rhee secret agents and oppose the cruel exploitation system.

　　According to South Korean Hapdong News Agency, more than three hundred workers at the Koryo Paper Company in Gunsan have started a general strike since the 20th. They demanded that all US-Rhee secret agent elements in the trade union get out and that the capitalists distribute 20% of the total profit—that is, one million hwan—to the workers. They stated that if these conditions were not accepted, they would refuse to work. According to Busan Culture Broadcasting Station, 250 farmers in Yangjeong-dong, Busan, launched a sit-in demonstration on the evening of the 16th to oppose Park, a US-Rhee secret agent who colluded with the puppet local authorities to harm the people. According to the farmers' exposure, Park colluded with the puppet Busan municipal government to buy 8,200 pyeong of "public land" at a price of 80 hwan per pyeong, and then forcibly sold it to the farmers here at a high price of 5,000 hwan per pyeong. This US-Rhee secret agent had also previously demanded a large amount of deposits from the farmers. On this day, angry farmers rushed to Park's home, demanding the return of the deposit and wanting to demolish his house. It is reported that the puppet authorities hurriedly sent a large number of troops and police to suppress the demonstrating masses.

　　This radio station also reported that merchants in Busan continue to launch anti-tax struggles. On the 19th, small merchants in the "Public Market" of Beomil-dong, Busan, sent representatives to the Busan puppet "Tax Bureau" to protest the puppet authorities' imposition of "murderous exorbitant taxes" on small merchants. They also held a meeting, accusing the puppet authorities of infringing upon the interests of small merchants.

    新华社平壤21日电　汉城消息：南朝鲜工人、农民和商人继续展开斗争，驱逐美李特务，反对残酷的剥削制度。
    据南朝鲜合同通讯社报道，群山市高丽制纸公司的三百多名工人从20日开始总罢工。他们要求工会里的美李特务分子全部滚开，并且要求资方把总利润的20％——即一百万圜分给工人。他们提出，如果这些条件不被接受，他们就要拒绝上工。据釜山文化广播电台广播，釜山市杨亭洞的二百五十名农民16日晚展开静坐斗争，反对勾结伪地方当局坑害人民的美李特务朴某。据农民们揭露，朴某勾结伪釜山市政府以八十圜一坪的价格买来“公田”八千二百坪，然后以五千圜一坪的高价强卖给这里的农民。这个美李特务事先还从农民手中索取了大量的定金。这一天，愤怒的农民们赶到朴某的家中，向他索还定金，并要捣毁他的房子。据报道，伪当局曾慌忙派去大批军警镇压示威的群众。
    这家电台还报道说，釜山市内的商人们继续展开抗税斗争。19日釜山市凡一洞“公设市场”内的小商人曾派代表到釜山市伪“税务署”抗议伪当局向小商人征收“杀人般的苛捐杂税”。他们还举行了集会，指责伪当局侵害小商人的利益。
