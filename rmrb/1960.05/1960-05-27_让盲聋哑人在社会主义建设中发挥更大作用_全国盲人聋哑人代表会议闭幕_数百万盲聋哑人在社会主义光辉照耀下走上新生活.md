Xinhua News Agency, May 25th. The First National Congress of Blind and Deaf-Mute People, which opened on May 20th, lasted for six days. More than three hundred representatives attended the meeting. The meeting closed today, and the China Association of the Blind and Deaf-Mute was officially established. The representatives attending the meeting unanimously adopted the "Constitution of the China Association of the Blind and Deaf-Mute," and elected Yu Yi'an as the Director of the China Association of the Blind and Deaf-Mute, Huang Nai, Meng Jingzhi, Chen Chi, and Hong Xueli as Deputy Directors, and Wang Chuanbin and seventy-three others as members of the China Association of the Blind and Deaf-Mute.

The meeting determined that the main tasks of the China Association of the Blind and Deaf-Mute are: to further strengthen the political and ideological education of the blind and deaf-mute masses, to organize the blind and deaf-mute to study Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's works; under the leadership of the Party committees at all levels, to assist urban and rural people's communes, based on the characteristics of the blind and deaf-mute and the principle of adapting to local conditions and individuals, to mobilize the blind and deaf-mute who can participate in productive labor to participate in various production and work; to actively assist cultural, educational, and health departments in carrying out education for the blind and deaf-mute, to do a good job in Braille publishing, and to gradually promote the universal sign language for the deaf-mute and the Chinese phonetic alphabet Braille scheme; to carry out prevention and treatment of blindness and deafness; to actively carry out cultural, recreational, and sports activities for the blind and deaf-mute, as well as social publicity and international liaison work for the work of the blind and deaf-mute.

The meeting unanimously passed a congratulatory telegram to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao amidst warm applause. The congratulatory telegram pointed out that only under the leadership and care of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, and only under the socialist system, can the blind and deaf-mute give full play to their talents and wisdom and become people who are disabled but not useless.

During the meeting, the heads of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Health made work reports to all the representatives attending the meeting on the welfare of the blind and deaf-mute. The meeting also heard and discussed the reports on the work of the blind and deaf-mute by the former China Welfare Association for the Blind and the China Welfare Association for the Deaf and Mute.

This newspaper reports that the welfare work for the blind and deaf-mute nationwide has achieved tremendous achievements in the past decade. Since the Great Leap Forward and the people's commune movement, the economic, cultural life, social status, and spiritual outlook of the blind and deaf-mute have undergone profound changes.

There are about 1.6 million blind people and more than 3 million deaf-mute people in our country. Most of them were poor laborers who lost their sight and hearing under the oppression and exploitation of reactionary rule, in the imperialist wars of aggression, and in the anti-people's wars of domestic reactionaries before liberation. In the old society, they were oppressed and discriminated against everywhere, and most people were deprived of the opportunity to receive education and work, and their lives were extremely miserable. Especially the fate of the blind was even more bitter, as they themselves said: "Since ancient times, blind people have had three paths: begging, fortune-telling, and singing," "No one cares when they are alive, and no one buries them when they die."

After the national liberation, the Party and the government took a series of measures to enable the blind and deaf-mute to end their tragic fate and change the world. First of all, the people's governments at all levels organized many blind and deaf-mute people to participate in production and work according to the characteristics of the blind and deaf-mute's physical defects and the principle of adapting to local conditions and individuals. According to incomplete statistics from twenty-one provinces and cities including Hebei, Liaoning, Guangdong, Beijing, and Shanghai, in addition to appropriately arranging for some blind and deaf-mute people to be employed in general enterprises, institutions, organizations, and schools, there were 954 production units specifically organized for the blind and deaf-mute by the end of 1959, with a total of more than 35,000 blind and deaf-mute production personnel. In rural areas, many people's communes made full use of the superior conditions of the commune's "large size and high degree of public ownership" to set up small factories specifically for the blind, enabling the blind to engage in production suitable for their characteristics. For example, after the people's commune movement in Huangpo County, Hubei Province, ten blind factories were quickly established, enabling more than 2,000 blind people to abandon superstitious occupations such as fortune-telling and divination, get rid of their dependent status, and become workers. Some factories have begun to establish a series of living welfare and cultural facilities such as barber shops, bathhouses, small shops, electric lights, telephones, broadcasting, and clubs. In cities, with the improvement of the degree of organization of economic life and the development of the people's commune movement, the avenues for production and employment for the blind and deaf-mute are becoming wider and wider.

With the development of China's entire cultural, educational, and health undertakings, China's cultural education and health undertakings for the blind and deaf-mute have also been greatly developed. Before liberation, there were only thirteen schools for the blind and twenty-eight schools for the deaf and mute in the country. After liberation, the education departments actively took measures to transform the old blind schools and deaf-mute schools, and established new educational institutions and organizations for the blind and deaf-mute. By September 1959, there were thirty-two schools for the blind, one hundred and forty-five schools for the deaf and mute, and one hundred and twenty schools for both blind and deaf-mute children in the country.

The health departments have also taken many effective measures for the prevention and treatment of blindness and deafness, which have achieved great results. For example, 70% of the blind and trachoma patients in Heilongjiang Province have improved their eyesight and regained their sight after treatment. Due to the improvement of the entire social life and hygiene conditions, fewer and fewer people are becoming blind or deaf. According to a typical survey by the Xiaoban People's Commune in Tianmen County, Hubei Province: In the ten years before liberation, 97 people became deaf for various reasons; in the ten years after liberation, only 8 people became deaf. Many blind people said excitedly after regaining their sight: "The old society turned healthy people into blind people, and the new society made blind people see the light again." Some deaf-mute people who regained their ability to speak after treatment said in their first sentence: "Long live the Communist Party! Long live Chairman Mao!" (Attached picture)

    让盲聋哑人在社会主义建设中发挥更大作用
    全国盲人聋哑人代表会议闭幕
    数百万盲聋哑人在社会主义光辉照耀下走上新生活
    新华社25日讯　第一届全国盲人聋哑人代表会议于5月20日开幕，历时六天。出席会议的代表三百多人。会议于今天闭幕，同时正式成立了中国盲人聋哑人协会。参加会议的代表们一致通过了“中国盲人聋哑人协会章程”，选出了余益庵为中国盲人聋哑人协会主任，黄乃、孟静之、陈驰、洪雪立四人为副主任，王传斌等七十三人为中国盲人聋哑人协会委员。
    会议确定中国盲人聋哑人协会的主要任务是：进一步加强对盲人、聋哑人群众的政治思想教育，组织盲人聋哑人学习马克思列宁主义和毛主席的著作；在各级中共党委的领导下，协助城乡人民公社，根据盲人聋哑人的特点和因地因人制宜的原则，动员能参加生产劳动的盲人聋哑人参加各种生产和工作；积极协助文化、教育、卫生等部门开展盲人和聋哑人的教育事业，作好盲文出版工作，逐步推行聋哑人通用手语和汉语拼音盲字方案；开展盲症聋症的防治工作；积极开展盲人聋哑人的文娱体育活动，以及盲人聋哑人工作的社会宣传和国际联络工作。
    会议在热烈的掌声中一致通过了向党中央和毛主席的致敬电。致敬电中指出，只有在中国共产党和毛主席的领导、关怀下，只有在社会主义制度下，盲人和聋哑人才能发挥自己的才能和智慧，成为残而不废的人。
    会议期间，内务部和卫生部的负责人向出席会议的全体代表作了有关盲人聋哑人福利等方面的工作报告。会议还听取和讨论了原中国盲人福利会和中国聋哑人福利会关于盲人聋哑人工作的报告。
    本报讯　全国盲人、聋哑人的福利工作，十年来取得了巨大成就。大跃进和人民公社化以来，盲人、聋哑人的经济、文化生活、社会地位、精神面貌，进一步发生了深刻变化。
    我国的盲人约一百六十余万，聋哑人约有三百多万。他们大部分是解放前在反动统治的压迫剥削下，在帝国主义的侵略战争和国内反动派反人民的战争中，失明失听的贫苦劳动人民。在旧社会，他们到处受压迫、受歧视，大多数人被剥夺了受教育和工作的机会，生活极为凄惨。尤其是盲人的命运更苦，正如他们自己所说：“自古盲人三条路，讨饭、算命、卖唱”，“活着无人管，死后无人埋”。
    全国解放后，党和政府采取了一系列措施，使盲人、聋哑人结束了悲惨命运，换了人间。首先，各地人民政府根据盲人、聋哑人生理缺陷的特点和因人因地制宜的原则，组织许多盲人、聋哑人参加了生产和工作。据河北、辽宁、广东、北京、上海等二十一个省市不完全统计，除了在一般企业、机关、团体、学校中，适当安置了一些盲人、聋哑人就业外，专门为盲人、聋哑人组织的生产单位，到1959年底已有九百五十四个，共有盲人、聋哑人生产人员三万五千多人。在农村，许多人民公社充分运用公社
  “一大二公”的优越条件，专门为盲人举办了小型工厂，使盲人从事适合他们特点的生产。如湖北省黄坡县在人民公社化以后，很快建立起了十处盲人工厂，使二千多个盲人丢掉了算命、卜卦等迷信职业，摆脱了依赖生活地位，变成了工人。有的工厂已开始建立了理发室、浴池、小卖部、电灯、电话、广播、俱乐部等一系列的生活福利和文化设施。在城市，随着经济生活组织程度的提高和人民公社化运动的开展，盲人、聋哑人生产就业的门路越来越广阔。
    随着我国整个文化教育和卫生事业的发展，我国盲人、聋哑人文化教育、卫生事业也有了很大发展。解放前，全国仅有十三所盲童学校，二十八所聋哑学校。解放后，教育部门积极采取措施改造旧盲校、聋哑学校，建立新的盲人、聋哑人教育机构和组织。到1959年9月，全国已有盲童学校三十二所，聋哑学校一百四十五所，盲童、聋哑儿童合校一百二十所。
    卫生部门对盲症、聋症的防治工作，也采取了许多有效措施，收到很大效果。如黑龙江省的盲人和重眼病人，经过治疗已有70％的人增强了视力和复明。由于整个社会生活、卫生条件的改善，致盲致聋的人越来越少了。据湖北天门县小板人民公社典型调查：解放前十年内因各种原因致聋的人有九十七人；解放后十年内致聋的仅八人。许多盲人复明后激动地说：“旧社会使健康人变成盲人，新社会使盲人重见光明”。有的聋哑人经治疗恢复说话能力以后，开口第一句就说：“共产党万岁！毛主席万岁！”（附图片）
