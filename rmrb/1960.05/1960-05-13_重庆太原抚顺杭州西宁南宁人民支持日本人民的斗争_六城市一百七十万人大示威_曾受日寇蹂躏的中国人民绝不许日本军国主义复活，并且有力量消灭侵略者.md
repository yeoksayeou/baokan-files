Xinhua News Agency Report: The movement of our people supporting the Japanese people's struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty is continuing to develop. Yesterday, May 12th, the six cities of Chongqing, Taiyuan, Fushun, Hangzhou, Xining, and Nanning held grand rallies and demonstrations. The total number of people participating in the rallies and demonstrations reached more than 1.7 million.

    Yesterday, the mountain city of Chongqing was ignited with flames of anger. Starting from noon, the mighty demonstration crowds poured into various venues. At Datianwan Square in the city center, more than 50,000 people held a city-wide people's rally in support of the Japanese people's opposition to the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty in the afternoon. All districts in Chongqing, as well as factories, schools, urban and rural people's communes, held rallies and demonstrations, with a total of 800,000 people participating. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Chongqing suffered continuous indiscriminate bombing by Japanese militarism. Entire streets were destroyed, and tens of thousands of people died at the hands of Japanese militarism. Many workers, farmers, and members of urban people's communes who personally suffered from the disasters of the Japanese militarist war of aggression participated in yesterday's rallies and demonstrations. More than 2,000 residents of the Jiaochangkou area, which was bombed by Japanese militarist planes during the War of Resistance Against Japan, leaving it in ruins and causing heavy casualties, held a demonstration, angrily denouncing the crimes of Japanese militarist elements.

    In Taiyuan, Shanxi Province, among the mighty demonstration队伍 (dui wu) of 150,000 people from all walks of life, there were anti-Japanese heroes who had fought bloody battles against the Japanese寇 (Kou) in the Taihang and Lüliang Mountains, family members of martyrs whose loved ones were taken away by Japanese fascist bandits, and people who had testified in military tribunals to try Japanese war criminals. Yesterday, they all angrily waved their fists, shouting slogans such as "Oppose the revival of Japanese militarism!" and participated in the demonstration. They carried huge banners with the words: "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "U.S. imperialism get out of Japan!" Zhen Rongdian, the famous "Cannonball King" of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region during the War of Resistance Against Japan, angrily denounced the crimes of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries in signing the military alliance treaty and threatening peace in Asia and the world. He said: We were able to produce a lot of cannonballs under such difficult conditions in the past to strike at the Japanese aggressors, and today we have the full power to defend world peace. He said: "We never beg for peace from aggressors, but order them: No war!"

    Fushun miners still clearly remember the brutal massacres they suffered during the bloody rule of Japanese militarism fifteen years ago. On April 6th, they sent a telegram to the Miike Coal Mine Union in Japan, which was suffering from the barbaric suppression of U.S.-Japan reactionary forces, expressing their firm support for the just struggle of the Miike miners. At dawn yesterday, 400,000 coal miners and people from all walks of life in Fushun held a mass rally in the city center square to support the Japanese people's struggle. Miner militias armed with weapons seized from the Japanese寇 (Kou) and miner teams from the six major coal mines stood at the forefront of the crowd. After the rally, 400,000 people held a demonstration parade on five routes. The demonstrating masses sang songs such as "Unity is Strength" and "Oppose Arming Japan." Many old workers who had suffered persecution by the Japanese fascists and who had fought bravely against the Japanese invaders denounced to the masses the crimes of the Japanese bandits in Fushun coal mines of massacring workers in batches and creating "Ten Thousand People Pits." Various art troupes performed street plays on the streets depicting the ugly faces of war criminal Nobusuke Kishi and revealing the new war conspiracy planned by the U.S.-Japan reactionaries.

    The people of Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, were completely angered by the conspiracy of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries to plan a new war. Yesterday, 160,000 people in Hangzhou held a massive rally and demonstration. Hubin Road and Nanshan Road along the West Lake were filled with dense crowds, and slogans such as "Oppose the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty!" "Oppose the revival of Japanese militarism!" "Down with U.S. imperialism!" resounded everywhere. In the ranks of thousands of fully armed and heroic militia members, leading the way was Zheng Peiyuan, a representative to the National Militia Congress and the militia company instructor of the Grain Retail Department in Shangcheng District, Hangzhou. His father was stabbed by Japanese寇 (Kou) with bayonets, his mother was raped, and his house was burned. Old and new hatreds intertwined, he clenched his gun and angrily warned that if the U.S.-Japan reactionaries dared to invade China again, the fully armed Chinese people would resolutely wipe them out completely.

    In Xining, Qinghai Province, 150,000 people from all ethnic groups and all walks of life held rallies and demonstrations. This powerful demonstration队伍 (dui wu), composed of workers, farmers, cadres, students, citizens, and PLA soldiers, marched to the "May 1st" Club Square, holding high banners. At the rally, Liu Zexi, member of the Standing Committee of the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and First Secretary of the Xining Municipal Committee, warned the U.S.-Japan reactionaries on behalf of the people of all ethnic groups in Qinghai Province that today's world is no longer a world where imperialism can run rampant. If U.S. imperialism and Japanese militarism dare to risk the world's condemnation and launch a war of aggression, it will only accelerate their own destruction!

    Nanning, Guangxi, which once suffered brutal bombing and looting by Japanese militarists, held a demonstration parade and mass rally today with more than 60,000 people braving the scorching heat to resolutely support the Japanese people's just struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. The demonstrating masses were in high spirits, and slogans such as "Oppose the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty!" and "The Chinese people unite and overthrow U.S. imperialism!" resounded throughout the streets and alleys.

    本报讯　据新华社消息：我国人民支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约斗争的运动正在继续发展，昨天——5月12日，重庆、太原、抚顺、杭州、西宁和南宁六个城市举行了盛大的集会和示威游行。参加集会和示威游行的总人数达到一百七十多万人。
    山城重庆昨天燃起了愤怒的火焰。从中午开始，浩浩荡荡的示威群众就涌向各个会场。在城区大田湾广场，下午有五万多人举行了全市各界人民支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约大会。重庆市全市各区和各工厂、学校、城市和农村人民公社都举行了集会和示威游行，参加集会和示威的总共有八十万人。在抗日战争中，重庆市连年遭受日本军国主义的狂轰滥炸，街道整条整条地被炸毁，成千上万的人死于日本军国主义的手下。许多亲身遭到日本军国主义侵略战争灾害的工人、农民和城市人民公社社员，都参加了昨天的集会和示威游行。曾经在抗日战争时期被日本军国主义飞机轰炸得片瓦不存、死伤惨重的较场口地区的二千多居民举行示威，愤怒地控诉日本军国主义分子的罪行。
    山西省太原市各界十五万人的浩浩荡荡的示威队伍中，有曾经在太行山、吕梁山上同日寇浴血苦战过的抗日英雄，有被日本法西斯强盗夺去亲人生命的烈士家属，还有曾经在军事法庭上为审判日本战犯作过证的人们。他们昨天都愤怒地挥动着拳头，高呼着“反对复活日本军国主义”的口号，参加了示威。他们抬着的巨大的标语牌上写着：“打倒美帝国主义！”“美帝国主义从日本滚出去！”抗日战争时期晋冀鲁豫边区有名的“炮弹大王”甄荣典，愤怒地斥责日美反动派签订军事同盟条约、威胁亚洲和世界和平的罪行。他说：我们能够在过去那样困难的条件下生产很多的炮弹，打击日本侵略者，今天就完全有力量保卫世界和平。他说：“我们从来不向侵略者乞求和平，而是命令他们：不许战争！”
    抚顺矿工至今还清楚记得十五年前日本军国主义血腥统治时期所受到的野蛮屠杀。他们曾在4月6日向遭受日美反动势力野蛮镇压的日本三池煤矿工会拍发电报，表示坚决支持三池矿工的正义斗争。昨天拂晓，抚顺市四十万煤矿工人和各界人民又在市中心广场举行了支援日本人民斗争的群众大会。用缴获日寇的武器武装起来的矿工民兵和六大煤矿的矿工队伍站在人流的最前列。大会结束以后，四十万群众分五路举行游行示威。参加示威的群众高唱“团结就是力量”、“反对武装日本”等歌曲。许多遭受过日本法西斯迫害的和与日本侵略者进行过英勇斗争的老工人，在队伍里向群众控诉了日本强盗在抚顺煤矿成批枪杀工人和制造
  “万人坑”的罪行，各文艺团体在街头演出了描绘岸信介战争贩子丑恶嘴脸的街头剧和揭露日美反动派策划新战争阴谋的活报剧。
    浙江省杭州市人民完全被美日反动派策划新战争的阴谋激怒了，昨天，杭州市十六万人举行了声势浩大的集会和示威游行。西湖畔的湖滨路和南山路，到处是密密的人群，到处响着“反对日美军事同盟条约！”“反对复活日本军国主义！”“打倒美帝国主义！”的口号声。在上千名全副武装、雄赳赳气昂昂的民兵队伍里，走在最前面的是出席全国民兵代表大会的代表、杭州市上城区粮食门市部民兵连指导员郑培元。他的父亲被日寇用刺刀刺伤，母亲遭强奸，房子被烧，旧仇新恨交织在一起，他紧握枪杆，愤怒地警告说，如果美日反动派胆敢再侵犯中国，全民武装了的中国人民就坚决把它消灭得干干净净。
    青海省西宁市的各族各界人民十五万人举行集会和示威游行。这支由工人、农民、干部、学生、市民和解放军战士组成的强大示威队伍，高举着标语牌，向“五一”俱乐部广场集中。大会上，中共青海省委常委、西宁市委第一书记刘泽西代表青海省各族各界人民警告美日反动派说，今天的世界，已经不再是帝国主义可以横行霸道的世界了。如果美帝国主义和日本军国主义胆敢冒天下之大不韪，发动侵略战争，那就只能加速他们自己的毁灭！
    曾经遭受日本军国主义者残酷轰炸和掠夺的广西南宁市，今天有六万多人冒着盛暑举行示威游行和群众大会，坚决支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约的正义斗争。示威的群众情绪激昂，大街小巷到处响彻着“反对日美军事同盟条约！”“中国人民团结起来，打倒美帝国主义”的口号声。（详细报道见第二版）
