    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 19th: Soviet major newspapers today published commentaries from their special correspondents in Paris, exposing the United States' crime of sabotaging the Four-Power Summit.

    Soviet "Pravda" special correspondents Frantsev, Radiani, and V. Krasov, in writing on May 19 about the US side's sabotage of the summit, raised the question: What are the intentions of the American official circles now? What methods are they using to get out of the established situation?

    The authors pointed out that on May 17, US Secretary of State Dulles convened a meeting of American journalists and gave instructions on the basic direction of the US official propaganda apparatus under the current conditions. The primary purpose is to insist that the failure of the Paris meeting to be held is due to the guilt of the Soviet Union. Doubt must be cast on the very idea of holding a four-power summit in the future.

    The second instruction is that newspapers and radio stations should take advantage of the established situation to promote the strengthening of the military strength of the United States and the entire "free world" in order to increase military spending through this path. The third, quite important instruction is that all these ideas should be disguised as the opinions and demands of the American public, rather than being promoted as the official line of the American government.

    "Pravda" reporters went on to say that on May 17, the Western heads of state held lengthy discussions on the United States' threatening demands: American diplomats demanded that Western European allies support American policies aimed at undermining the summit. The discussion lasted almost all day. Finally, in the evening, the three countries repeated what the White House spokesman had read to newspaper reporters in the morning, using more pleasant diplomatic language.

    The "Izvestia" special correspondent said in a commentary that the United States would rather sabotage the meeting than abandon its policy of provocation against the Soviet Union. A careful look at recent events can convince one that the United States is unwilling to abandon its policy of provocation against the Soviet Union and that the many measures taken by the US government to undermine the summit are just one link in the chain. American aggressors have carried out many covert acts of sabotage in terms of politics, military affairs, and propaganda. For example, the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization held secret meetings before the summit. At this meeting, chaired by General Speidel, Hitler's general, tactics against the Soviet Union were formulated. They had long expected the summit to fail. Now that the failure of the great power conference has become a reality, all the propaganda machines of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, started by the US State Department, are back in action. American journalists are trying their best to shift the blame for destroying the meeting onto the Soviet Union. However, now that the true face of the American aggressors has been exposed to the world, no matter how cleverly they evade, they cannot escape their responsibility.

    苏联“真理报”和“消息报”记者揭露
    美国千方百计破坏四国会议
    赫脱策划新阴谋企图转嫁罪责并加紧备战
    据新华社莫斯科19日电　苏联各主要报纸今天都发表它们驻巴黎特派记者的述评，揭露美国破坏四国首脑会议的罪行。
    苏联“真理报”特派记者弗兰采夫、拉季阿尼和?克拉索夫19日在写到美国方面破坏首脑会议一事时提出了一个问题：美国官方集团现在的意图如何？他们正在用什么办法摆脱既成局面？
    作者指出，5月17日，美国国务卿赫脱曾经召集美国记者开了一次会，并且对美国官方宣传机构在当前条件下的基本方针作了指示。首要的目的是，要硬说巴黎会议没有能举行是由于苏联的罪过。必须对将来举行四国政府首脑会议的这一思想本身表示怀疑。
    第二个指示是：报纸和电台应当利用既成局面，宣传加强美国和整个“自由世界”的军事力量，以便通过这种道路增加军事开支。第三个相当重要的指示是：应当把所有这些思想冒充成美国公众的意见和要求，而不要把它宣传成美国政府的官方路线。
    “真理报”记者接着谈到5月17日西方国家首脑长时间地讨论了美国威胁性的要求：美国外交人士要求西欧盟国支持美国目的在于破坏最高级会议的政策。几乎讨论了一整天。终于在傍晚时分，三国用比较好听的外交词令重复了白宫发言人早上向报纸记者宣读过的东西。
    “消息报”特派记者在述评中说，美国宁愿破坏这个会议也不愿放弃对苏联进行挑衅的政策。仔细看一下最近以来的事件就可以坚信，美国不愿意放弃对苏联的挑衅政策，只是美国政府为了破坏政府首脑会议所采取的许多措施中的一环，美国侵略者从政治、军事、宣传各方面进行了许多暗中破坏的工作。例如，北大西洋公约集团成员国在政府首脑会议以前举行了秘密会议。在这个由希特勒将军斯派达尔主持的会议上拟定了反对苏联的策略。他们早就指望政府首脑会议失败。现在，当大国会议失败已成为事实时，由美国国务院开动的北大西洋公约集团的所有宣传机器又在行动起来。美国记者们正在竭力把破坏会议的罪过推到苏联身上。但是，现在美国侵略者的真面目已暴露在全世界面前，不管他们如何巧妙地回避，都不能逃脱自己的责任。
