Xinhua News Agency, New York, May 17th: US Vice President Nixon, on the 15th, publicly declared with an aggressor's tone that as long as the Soviet Union continues to implement its policy of secrecy, the United States has reason to take measures like sending U-2 aircraft to intrude into Soviet airspace to gather intelligence. He does not believe that the US sending planes to Soviet airspace to conduct espionage activities on the eve of the East-West summit meeting was a "mistake."

Nixon made this outcry while answering questions on a television program in New York. He once again confirmed that US President Eisenhower was the mastermind behind the US aircraft's violation of Soviet airspace and espionage activities. He said that Eisenhower was fully aware of these spy plane flights and believed it was "necessary" to order the implementation of this aerial reconnaissance plan to "collect (Soviet) intelligence." Nixon also confessed that he "knew the inside story" and "agreed with this matter."

Nixon defended the US State Department's initial public lies about the spy plane incident by saying that he did not want to "criticize" the State Department because it did not know that the Soviet Union had captured the American spy plane pilot at that time, and reporters were clamoring for information. Nixon emphasized that he agreed with Secretary of State Herter's statement that the United States would continue to collect the Soviet intelligence that U-2 aircraft were meant to gather.

When asked if it was wise to carry out such flights on the eve of the Four-Power Summit, Nixon replied that such actions must have "a continuous plan."

On the 13th, Nixon also spoke about US spy plane activities at a secret gathering attended by one hundred major entrepreneurs. It was revealed that Nixon shamelessly said at the meeting that US spy plane activities had been going on for four years and that these reconnaissance flights had provided the United States with "essential" intelligence, including hundreds of thousands of photographs, which could not be obtained by other means under any circumstances.

    尼克松叫嚣坚持侵略政策
    公开叫嚷美国有理由侵犯苏联收集情报
    供认美国间谍飞机活动已经进行了四年
    新华社17日讯　纽约消息：美国副总统尼克松15日公开以侵略者的口吻说，只要苏联继续执行保密政策，美国就有理由采取像派U—2型飞机侵入苏联领空搜集情报那样的措施。他并不认为美国在东西方最高级会议前夕派飞机到苏联领空进行间谍活动是一个“错误”。
    尼克松是在纽约的电视节目中回答问题时发出这种叫喊的。他再一次证实，美国总统艾森豪威尔是美国飞机侵犯苏联领空和进行间谍活动的主谋。他说，艾森豪威尔完全知道这种间谍飞机的飞行，并且认为“有必要”下令推行这个空中侦察的计划来“收集（苏联的）情报”。尼克松还招认说，他也“了解内情”，也“赞成这件事”。
    尼克松为美国国务院最初就间谍飞机事件公开撒谎辩护说，他不想“批评”国务院，因为国务院那时不知道苏联逮到了美国间谍飞机的驾驶员，而记者们又叫嚷着要消息。尼克松强调说，他同意国务卿赫脱这样的声明：美国将要继续搜集U—2型飞机要搜集的苏联情报。
    有人问他在四国首脑会议前夕进行这种飞行是否明智，尼克松回答说，这种行动必须有“一个连续不断的计划”。
    尼克松13日还曾经在一个有一百名大企业家参加的秘密集会上谈到美国的间谍飞机活动。据透露，尼克松在会上恬不知耻地说，美国的间谍飞机活动已进行了四年，这种侦察情报的飞行已经为美国提供了“必不可少的”包括几十万张照片在内的情报，而这些情报是无论如何不能以其他方法获得的。
