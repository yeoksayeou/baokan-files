Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 9th May: A grand parade was held in Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia, this morning to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the liberation of Czechoslovakia by the Soviet Army.

From early morning, tens of thousands of people gathered at Letná Plain, where the parade was held. Everywhere was filled with a joyful festive atmosphere.

Leaders of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the state, as well as the Soviet delegation and other distinguished guests, attended the parade ceremony.

Czechoslovak Minister of National Defence Lomský delivered a speech at the ceremony. He said that the Czechoslovak people will advance shoulder to shoulder with the countries of the socialist camp on the road to completing socialist construction.

He emphasized that, contrary to the efforts of socialist countries to strive for peace, imperialist aggressive forces are frantically carrying out activities, attempting to continue the "Cold War" and the arms race, and keep the world on the brink of war. He said: "Therefore, we must never relax our vigilance against such aggressive forces at any time."

He then pointed out that as long as the forces of war are not restrained for one day, and as long as complete and thorough disarmament is not achieved for one day, it is always necessary to make every effort to defend peace, defend socialism, and defend national security.

Lomský pointed out that Comrade Khrushchev's report at the Soviet Supreme Soviet session dealt a heavy blow to anti-peace conspiracies. He said that all the Czechoslovak people support Comrade Khrushchev's views.

After the speech, the military parade began. Leading the way were students from various military academies. Then, troops from various services passed through the square in succession. The latest supersonic jet fighters, the latest recoilless anti-tank guns, twin-barreled anti-aircraft guns, and the latest manufactured giant tanks attracted people's attention.

When the parade ended, people flocked to the reviewing stand, cheering "Long live the Czechoslovak Communist Party!" "Long live the Soviet Union!"

The First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and President of the Republic, Novotný, delivered a brief speech to the cheering masses. He encouraged the Czech and Slovak nations to always be united like one person. He emphasized that the close alliance with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries is the cornerstone of the smooth development of Czechoslovakia's national economy. He expressed hope that the close unity with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries will continue to develop and consolidate.

Novotný's speech was warmly cheered and applauded by the masses.

    洛姆斯基说任何时候都不能放松对侵略势力的警惕
    新华社布拉格9日电　捷克斯洛伐克首都布拉格今天上午举行了盛大的阅兵典礼，庆祝苏军解放捷克斯洛伐克十五周年。
    从一清早起，成千上万的人就聚集到举行阅兵的勒提尼广场。到处洋溢着欢乐的节日气氛。
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党和国家的领导人，以及苏联代表团和其他贵宾出席了阅兵典礼。
    捷克斯洛伐克国防部长洛姆斯基在典礼上发表了演说。他说，捷克斯洛伐克人民在完成社会主义建设的道路上，将同社会主义阵营各国并肩前进。
    他着重指出，和社会主义国家争取和平的努力相反，帝国主义侵略势力正在疯狂地进行活动，企图继续进行“冷战”和军备竞赛，并把世界保持在战争边缘上。他说：“因此，我们在任何时候都不能放松对这种侵略势力的警惕。”
    他接着指出，只要战争力量一天没有受到约束，只要全面彻底裁军一天没有实现，就始终有必要尽一切努力来保卫和平，保卫社会主义和国家的安全。
    洛姆斯基指出，赫鲁晓夫同志在苏联最高苏维埃会议上所作的报告，给了反和平的阴谋一个沉重的打击。他说，全体捷克斯洛伐克人民都支持赫鲁晓夫同志的意见。
    演说结束后，阅兵分列式开始。走在最前面的是各军事学院的学员。接着，各兵种部队相继通过广场。最新式的超音速喷气歼击机、最新式的无座力反坦克炮、双筒高射炮、最新制造的巨型坦克等，吸引了人们的注意。
    当阅兵结束时，人们拥向检阅台，欢呼“捷克斯洛伐克共产党万岁！”“苏联万岁！”
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会第一书记、共和国总统诺沃提尼向欢呼的群众发表了简短的讲话。他勉励捷克和斯洛伐克这两个民族永远团结得像一个人一样。他强调指出，同苏联和其他社会主义国家的紧密联盟，是捷克斯洛伐克国民经济顺利发展的基石。他表示希望，同苏联和其他社会主义国家的紧密团结将不断发展和巩固。
    诺沃提尼的讲话受到了群众的热烈欢呼和鼓掌。
