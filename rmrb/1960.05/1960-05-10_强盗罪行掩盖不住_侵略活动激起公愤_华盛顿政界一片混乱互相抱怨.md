Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 9th: After Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev once again exposed the undeniable fact of the American plane's invasion of Soviet airspace for espionage activities at the closing meeting of the Supreme Soviet, Washington fell into chaos and mutual blame.

U.S. President Eisenhower, after returning to Washington from his Gettysburg farm on the 8th, immediately held consultations at the White House with Secretary of State Herter, who was waiting for him there, regarding the plane incident, and convened a National Security Council meeting today, three days earlier than usual.

James Reston, chief Washington correspondent for the "New York Times," said that after Khrushchev's closing remarks at the Supreme Soviet meeting, "a silent and chaotic atmosphere enveloped the (American) capital for most of the day." This is because in the three days after the Soviet Union first announced that an American plane had been shot down, American newspapers and officials had been trying to convince the world that the lies fabricated and propagated by the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the U.S. State Department regarding the plane incident were "true."

California Young Democrats accused the American plane's activities of being a "first-class act of provocation" and expressed "shock" at the U.S. government's admission of intelligence gathering. They demanded that Eisenhower make a full report to the nation as to which agencies and individuals approved the U-2 plane's overflight of Soviet airspace for espionage activities.

A Republican Congressman who refused to reveal his name cursed the U.S. State Department, saying that using "idiots" and "stupid" to describe the State Department's handling of the matter would be considered a mild curse.

Senator Bridges clamored that the downing of the American spy plane "clearly weakened" the U.S.'s "position" at the summit conference. Congressman Fascell believed that the "most unfavorable aspect" of this matter for the U.S. was that it "gave the Soviets a very favorable psychological advantage" on the eve of the summit conference. Senator Symington believed that the U.S. State Department's admission was causing "our (American) position in the world to decline."

    强盗罪行掩盖不住　侵略活动激起公愤
    华盛顿政界一片混乱互相抱怨
    据新华社9日讯　华盛顿消息：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在苏联最高苏维埃闭幕会议上再次揭露了美国飞机侵犯苏联领空进行间谍活动的不容抵赖的事实后，华盛顿陷于一片混乱和互相抱怨指责中。
    美国总统艾森豪威尔8日在从他的葛底斯堡农庄返回华盛顿后，立即在白宫同在那里等待着他的国务卿赫脱就飞机事件举行了会商，并且比惯例提前三天在今天召开了国家安全委员会会议。
    “纽约时报”驻华盛顿首席记者赖斯顿说，在赫鲁晓夫在最高苏维埃会议上的结束语发表后，“在（美国）首都，大半天的时间里笼罩着沉默混乱的气氛”。因为在苏联第一次宣布美国飞机被击落后的三天中，美国报纸和官方人士一直企图使世界公众相信，美国星际和空间航行局和美国国务院就飞机事件所捏造和宣传的谎言是“真实的”。
    加利福尼亚州青年民主党人指责美国飞机的活动是“头等的挑衅行动”，并且对美国政府承认搜集情报一事“感到震惊”。他们要求艾森豪威尔向全国作出充分的报告，究竟是什么机构和什么人批准Ｕ—2型飞机飞越苏联领空进行间谍活动的。
    一个拒绝透露姓名的共和党议员大骂美国国务院说，用“笨蛋”和“愚蠢”来形容国务院处理这件事情的方法还算是比较温和的咒语。
    参议员布里奇斯叫嚷，美国间谍飞机的被击落“显然削弱了”美国在最高级会议上的“地位”。众议员法赛耳认为这件事对美国“最不利的方面”是在最高级会议前夕“使苏联人得到了心理方面的非常有利的条件”。参议员薛明顿认为，美国国务院的承认使“我们（美国）在全世界的地位正在下降”。
