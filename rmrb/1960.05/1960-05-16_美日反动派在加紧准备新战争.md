U.S.-Japanese Reactionaries Intensifying Preparations for New War
Liu Chu
    Regardless of the strong condemnation from world public opinion and the strong opposition from the Japanese people, the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries are attempting to force the Japanese Diet to approve the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, while also stepping up war preparations in the Far East. This conspiracy by the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries must arouse our vigilance.
    First, U.S. imperialism has decided to increase its forces and equipment in the Far East. According to a Kyodo News Agency dispatch from Washington on April 1, the U.S. Army Department announced on March 30 that it would deploy an air-transportable combat group of approximately 2,000 men to Okinawa in June of this year, equipped with artillery, engineers, aviation, and other branches of service. This is a "pentomic division" unit, and the nuclear weapons it requires will be supplied from Hawaii at any time. The dispatch cited reports from American newspapers stating that U.S. authorities had planned to increase forces centered on Okinawa in the Far East after the signing of the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" as the initial step in concretely implementing the new "Security Treaty." The U.S. Army Department also announced the establishment of a "Mobile Logistics Command" in Okinawa, the main purpose of which is to support U.S. Army combat forces in any area of the Pacific. Okinawa, a Japanese territory occupied by U.S. imperialism, is playing an increasingly important role as a nuclear war base for U.S. imperialism targeting our country, the Soviet Union, and other Asian countries.
    Second, Japan is expanding its armed forces under the support of U.S. imperialism. In terms of army building, Japan, like West Germany, is building its standing army into a "cadre force" to prepare a backbone for rapid expansion during wartime. The proportion of officers and sergeants in the Japanese army is now much larger than before the war. As of the end of 1959, there were more than 28,000 officers in the Japanese army, accounting for 10.8% of the total number of officers and soldiers (the proportion of officers before the war was 5.4%). There were more than 68,000 sergeants, accounting for 26% (14.8% before the war). The total of the two is more than 96,000, accounting for 36.8% of the total number of more than 260,000 officers and soldiers. By 1965, when the Japanese army completes the second phase of its expansion plan, there will be more than 40,000 officers and more than 100,000 sergeants, totaling more than 140,000, accounting for 45.2% of the total number of officers and soldiers (more than 310,000), basically achieving the goal of a "cadre force." Another important measure Japan is taking in army building is to expand the direct and indirect reserve forces of the Japanese army. Japan is currently actively expanding the "reserve Self-Defense Force" as a direct reserve force. As of the end of 1959, there were more than 11,000 "reserve Self-Defense Force" personnel, accounting for 7% of the total number of veterans. Japanese military authorities believe that this cannot meet the needs of expanding armaments and preparing for war, so they have decided to increase the total number of reserve personnel to 80,000 by 1965, which is approximately 26% of the total number of more than 310,000 officers and soldiers in active service at that time. At the same time, Japanese military authorities are vigorously supporting militarist groups and organizations of veterans with former soldiers as the core to strengthen their indirect reserve forces. The "Kyoyu Renmei" (Hometown Friends Alliance), a Japanese veteran group chaired by Okamura Neji, a war criminal with hands stained with the blood of the Chinese people, already has 1.5 million members, including 200,000 former officers. The "Doyu Kai" (Comrades Association), a Japanese veteran group, has also developed to more than 12,000 members.
    In terms of strengthening the equipment of the army, the main policy is to focus on the development of missiles, strengthen the modernization of Japanese armaments, and prepare conditions for future nuclear armament. The second phase of the expansion plan (1961-1965) formulated by the Kishi Nobusuke government stipulates that the Japanese army, navy, and air force will be equipped with missiles by 1965. The Kishi Nobusuke government has already imported 14 "Sidewinder" air-to-air missiles from the United States and plans to continue purchasing them in large quantities in the future. By 1965, the front-line air force will be fully equipped with "Sidewinder" missiles. On March 31, the Kishi Nobusuke government also signed an agreement with the U.S. government for Japan to purchase "Tartar" sea-to-air missiles from the United States. Japanese military authorities plan to equip large naval vessels that Japan will begin building this year with "Tartar" missiles. In the army, the focus is on developing surface-to-air missile units. Japanese military authorities plan to build four battalions of "Nike" missile units and four battalions of "Hawk" missile units by 1965, and strive to establish four companies of "Bomarc" missile units that can be equipped with nuclear warheads (all three are surface-to-air missiles).
    Japan's military industry is also developing in the direction of manufacturing modern weapons. On April 15, Japan and the United States formally exchanged documents regarding an agreement reached between the two countries. This agreement stipulates that the United States will provide Japan with 75 million U.S. dollars in "aid" to help Japan produce 200 "Lockheed" jet fighters. U.S. "aid" accounts for 28% of the total cost of producing these aircraft, which is 270 million U.S. dollars. Japan's various monopoly groups are competing to test-produce missiles. Japan is currently concentrating the strength of the government, zaibatsu, and scientific research departments to establish an organization centered on missile production, and has implemented a division of labor among the major zaibatsu. It is said that the Mitsubishi Group is responsible for trial-producing surface-to-air missiles; the Fuji Precision Group is trial-producing air-to-air missiles; the Kawasaki Group is trial-producing anti-tank missiles; and the Mitsui Group is trial-producing low-altitude surface-to-air missiles. According to the estimate of the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations, the output value of Japanese aircraft will increase from 22.7 billion yen this year to 41.3 billion yen in 1966; during the same period, the output value of missiles will increase from 200 million yen this year to 15 billion yen.
    Finally, in order to prepare ideologically for launching a new war of aggression, the Japanese reactionaries represented by the Kishi Nobusuke group are vigorously promoting militarist education in the country. First, they openly restore militarist education in the Japanese army, undisguisedly instilling fascist ideas such as "Japanese national spirit," "Yamato spirit," and "bushido" into officers and soldiers; and calling on soldiers to inherit the "souls and traditions of their predecessors," etc. Second, a large number of films promoting militarism are produced to carry out universal fascist education for young people. According to statistics, there are currently more than ten such films. These films promote that Japan is a "divine country" and that "the Yamato nation is the most excellent nation in the world," as well as the so-called "spirit of gyokusai and glorious achievements of the Japanese Imperial Army" in World War II. Among them, the film "The Greater East Asia War and International Trials" tries its best to reverse the Japanese war crimes, portraying the Pacific War as a "legitimate war of self-defense for Japan," while the heinous war criminal Tojo Hideki is portrayed as a "patriot" and "national hero," and even saying that Japan has "no responsibility" for the monstrous crimes committed by the Japanese army in China. Third, the emperor and his family are once again put forward as tools to deceive the people. In recent years, the Japanese reactionaries have been trying every means to enhance the "prestige" of the emperor and have restored the celebrations of Kigen-setsu (the founding day of the first emperor) and Tencho-setsu (the birthday of the current emperor). Last year, the Kishi Nobusuke government also held grand celebrations for the marriage of the crown prince. Fourth, the Japanese reactionaries have restored militarist "moral education" in primary and secondary schools across the country. Students are educated to "love the country," "obey their superiors," "love the Rising Sun flag," and sing the "Kimigayo" national anthem. Students are also organized to read "stories of loyal subjects" and "biographies of great men," and militarists are invited to schools to give reports to poison the students' minds.
    The above facts clearly tell us that the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries are stepping up preparations for a new war of aggression in the Far East. We must fully raise our vigilance, unite with the people of the Soviet Union, the people of other Asian countries, and the Japanese people, and resolutely fight to shatter this conspiracy of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries.

    美日反动派在加紧准备新战争
    柳初
    美日反动派不顾世界舆论的严厉谴责和日本人民的强烈反对，在企图迫使日本国会强行批准美日军事同盟条约的同时，还正在远东加紧备战活动。美日反动派的这一阴谋活动，必须引起我们的警惕。
    首先，美帝国主义决定增强它在远东地区的兵力和装备。据4月1日日本共同社发自华盛顿的一条电讯，美国陆军部在3月30日宣布，今年6月间，将增派一个配有炮兵、工兵、航空队和其他兵种的空运战斗大队约二千人到冲绳去。这是一个“五单位制原子师”部队，它所需的核武器将从夏威夷随时供应。这条电讯援引美国报纸的报道说，美国当局在新日美“安全条约”签署以后就计划增强以冲绳为中心的远东地区兵力，作为具体执行新“安全条约”的最初步骤。美国陆军部同时还宣布要在冲绳成立一个“机动后勤司令部”，这个司令部的主要目的是支持太平洋任何地区的美国陆军战斗部队。被美国霸占的日本领土冲绳，作为美帝国主义针对我国、苏联以及亚洲其他国家的核战争基地的作用，正在不断加强。
    其次，日本正在美帝国主义的扶植下扩大武装力量。在军队建设方面，日本和西德一样，正在把常备军建设成一支“干部队伍”，为战时迅速扩军准备好一套骨干。现在日本军队军官和军士的比重大大超过战前。截至1959年底，日本军队军官共有二万八千多人，占官兵总数的10.8％（战前军官的比重为5.4％）。军士六万八千多人，占26％（战前为14.8％）。两者合计九万六千多人，占总数二十六万多人的36.8％。到1965年日本军队完成第二期扩军计划时，将有军官四万多人，军士十万多人，两者合计十四万多人，将占官兵总数（三十一万多人）的45.2％，基本上完成“干部队伍”的目标。日本在军队建设方面的另一个重要措施，就是扩大日本军队的直接和间接的后备力量。目前日本正在积极扩大“预备自卫官”队伍，作为直接后备力量。截至1959年底，“预备自卫官”共有一万一千多人，占退伍军人总数的7％。日本军事当局认为这不能满足扩军备战的需要，因此决定要在1965年以前，使后备人员总数达到八万人，约等于当时在役总兵力三十一万多人的26％。日本军事当局同时还在大力扶植以旧军人为核心的军国主义团体和组织退伍军人等，来壮大自己的间接后备力量。由双手沾满中国人民鲜血的战犯冈村宁次担任会长的日本旧军人团体“乡友联盟”，已拥有会员一百五十万人，其中有旧军官二十万人。日本退伍军人团体“队友会”，目前的会员也已发展到一万二千多人。
    在加强军队的装备方面，主要方针是以发展导弹为重点，加强日本军备的现代化，为将来的核武装准备条件。岸信介政府制定的第二期扩军计划（1961—1965年），规定日本全部陆海空军在1965年以前实行导弹装备。岸信介政府已从美国运进了十四枚“响尾蛇”式空空导弹，今后还准备继续大量购买。到1965年，第一线空军准备全部装备“响尾蛇”式导弹。3月31日，岸信介政府又和美国政府就日本向美国购买“鞑靼”式海空导弹签订了一项协定。日本军事当局打算用“鞑靼”式导弹来装备日本将在年内开始建造的大型海军舰艇。在陆军方面，重点为发展地对空导弹部队。日本军事当局预定在1965年以前，建成四个营的“奈克”式导弹部队，四个营的“隼”式导弹部队，并争取成立四个连可以安装核弹头的“鲍马克”式导弹部队（以上三种都是地空导弹）。
    日本的军需工业也在向着制造现代化武器的方向发展。4月15日，日本和美国就两国达成的一项协议进行正式换文。这项协议规定美国给日本七千五百万美元的“援助”，帮助日本生产二百架“洛克希德”式喷气战斗机。美国的“援助”占这批飞机生产总费用二亿七千万美元的28％。日本的各个垄断集团，竞相试制导弹。目前日本正集中政府、财阀和科学研究部门的力量，建立一个以生产导弹为中心的机构，并在各大财阀间实行了分工。据说三菱集团负责试制地对空导弹；富士精密集团试制空对空导弹；川崎集团试制反坦克导弹；三井集团试制低空用地对空导弹。根据日本经济团体联合会估计，日本飞机的产值将从今年的二百二十七亿日元增至1966年的四百十三亿日元；同一时期，导弹的产值将从今年的二亿日元增至一百五十亿日元。
    最后，为发动新的侵略战争进行思想准备，以岸信介集团为代表的日本反动派正在国内大力推行军国主义教育。第一，他们在日本军队中公开恢复军国主义教育，毫不掩饰地向官兵灌输有关“日本民族精神”、“大和魂”和“武士道”等法西斯思想；号召士兵要继承“先人的灵魂和传统”等。第二，大量摄制宣扬军国主义的影片，向青少年普遍进行法西斯教育。据统计，目前已有十多部这样的影片。这些影片宣扬日本是“神国”、“大和民族是世界上最优秀的民族”，第二次世界大战中所谓“日本皇军的玉碎精神和赫赫战果”。其中“大东亚战争与国际审判”一片，竭力为日本的战争罪行翻案，把太平洋战争写成是“日本正当的自卫战”，而罪大恶极的战犯东条英机，则是“爱国者”和“民族英雄”，甚至说日本对日本军队在中国犯下的滔天罪行“没有任何责任”。第三，重新抬出天皇及其家属来作为欺骗人民的工具。日本反动派近年来正在千方百计地提高天皇的“威信”，恢复了纪元节（第一代天皇开国日）和天长节（当代天皇的生日）的庆祝活动。去年岸信介政府为皇太子的结婚也举行了隆重的庆祝。第四，日本反动派在全国中小学恢复了军国主义的“道德教育”。教育学生要“爱国”“服从长上”，“爱太阳旗”、唱“君之代”国歌，还组织学生读“忠臣故事”、“伟人传记”，请军国主义分子到学校作报告，来毒化学生的思想。
    以上事实明显地告诉我们，美日反动派正在远东加紧准备新的侵略战争。我们必须充分地提高警惕，同苏联人民、亚洲其他各国人民以及日本人民团结在一起，坚决为粉碎美日反动派的这一阴谋而斗争。
