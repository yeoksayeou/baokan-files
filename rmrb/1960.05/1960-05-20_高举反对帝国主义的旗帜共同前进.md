    The delegation of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, headed by Vice Premier Krim Belkacem, has concluded its friendly visit to our country. During these days, Vice Premier Krim Belkacem and other distinguished Algerian guests visited various parts of our country, celebrated the "May Day" International Labor Day with our people, and held cordial and friendly meetings with our national leaders. Today, our newspaper publishes the joint communique of the Chinese and Algerian governments. This communique demonstrates the two governments' consistent views on the international situation, and shows the mutual concern and support of the Chinese and Algerian people in the common struggle against imperialism. We firmly believe that the visit of the delegation of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, headed by Vice Premier Krim Belkacem, will bring the fraternal friendship and deep respect of the six hundred and fifty million Chinese people back to the heroic people of Algeria who are fighting for the independence of their motherland.
    The joint communique points out that in the talks, the Government of the People's Republic of China sternly opposes and condemns the French imperialists, supported by US imperialism, for carrying out colonial war and acts of aggression against the Algerian people. As everyone knows, the Algerian War is a dirty colonial war launched by French imperialism. French colonialists have enslaved Algeria for as long as one hundred and thirty years, causing profound disasters to the Algerian people. More than half of the arable land in Algeria has been seized by a small number of colonialists, and Algeria's resources are almost entirely controlled by French monopoly companies. Among the ten million people in Algeria, unemployment and semi-unemployment reach two million, millions of people are often trapped in hunger, and millions of school-age children are wandering in the streets. The Algerian people are deprived of all political rights. For the interests of French monopoly capital, successive French governments since 1955 have spared no effort to mobilize most of the country's military forces to launch an unprecedentedly barbaric and inhuman colonial war against the Algerian people who demand national independence. For several years, French colonialists, who claim to be "messengers of civilization," have massacred one million people in Algeria, detained more than one million people in concentration camps, imprisoned hundreds of thousands of people, and subjected them to various inhumane tortures; another hundreds of thousands of people have been reduced to exiles in foreign countries, displaced and homeless. The towering crimes committed by the French imperialists in the Algerian War have been strongly condemned and opposed by the whole world.
    For more than a century, the Algerian people have never ceased their struggle for independence, and more than fifty armed uprisings have erupted. The Algerian national liberation war is a part of the worldwide people's struggle against imperialism and for the defense of world peace. The Chinese people unswervingly support the struggle of the Algerian people, as solemnly declared in the joint communique of the Chinese and Algerian governments: "The Chinese government reiterates its firm support for the just struggle of the Algerian people for national independence."
    The French colonial war against the Algerian people is being carried out entirely with the active support of US imperialism. In order to plunder the Sahara oil fields and Algeria's rich resources, and in order to suppress the national independence movements in Africa and Arab countries, US imperialism continues to help the French imperialists with large amounts of dollars and weapons to massacre the Algerian people, in order to support the remaining colonial rule of France in Algeria. Vice Premier Krim Belkacem correctly pointed out at the welcoming banquet given by our Vice Premier He Long, "US imperialism and French colonialism are colluding with each other to defeat the Algerian revolution." It is very clear that today US imperialism has become the most dangerous enemy of the Algerian people.
    Now, de Gaulle has nakedly torn off his disguise of so-called "self-determination" for the Algerian people, and clamors for "restoring peace by force." At the end of last year, former French Minister of Armed Forces Guillaumat announced during the Senate debate on the military budget that in the new military budget draft, "operations in Algeria will still have priority," and that it is necessary to further "obtain" "striking power" "through foreign allies." At the same time, French colonialists, with the support of US imperialism, are conspiring to expand the Algerian War. Recently, French troops have repeatedly violated the Tunisian border, and French aircraft have bombed the territories of Tunisia and Morocco. The US and French imperialists are using this to intimidate the Algerian people. However, the five and a half years of the Algerian War have proved that the Algerian National Liberation Army is growing stronger day by day, while the French colonial army is weakening day by day. In the past five years, the French colonial army has suffered more than 100,000 casualties, and in the first four months of this year, the Algerian National Liberation Army killed or wounded nearly 20,000 French troops. The people who fight for a just cause will win, and the imperialists who fight to maintain colonial rule will be defeated. This is certain. The joint communique expresses the Chinese people's belief: "With the support of peace-loving people all over the world, the heroic Algerian people will surely defeat imperialism and colonialism and win the final victory of the national liberation struggle by persisting in the struggle."
    The joint communique correctly assesses the international situation, especially the situation in Asia and Africa. Both sides are pleased to see that the storm of national liberation struggle is sweeping violently across vast areas of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are forming a broad united front against imperialism. Recently, the situation has become increasingly favorable to the national liberation struggles of various countries. The oppressed people of Asian countries are rising up in a great storm of struggle against imperialism and its lackeys. The struggles of the Japanese people, the South Korean people, and the Turkish people, as well as the just struggles of the people of all countries in the world against imperialism, are a great encouragement and support to the struggles of the Chinese and Algerian people. And the struggles of the Chinese and Algerian people are also an encouragement and support to the struggles of the people of all countries in the world against imperialism. As the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, said: "The just struggles of the people of all countries in the world support each other." The joint communique of the Chinese and Algerian governments expresses the firm support of the two peoples for the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries who are engaged in the just struggle for national independence and democratic freedom. Imperialism, especially US imperialism, is not only the common enemy of the Chinese and Algerian people, but also the common enemy of the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the whole world. As long as the people of all countries in the world unite under the banner of the struggle against imperialism, forming an unbreakable united front, as the joint communique points out, the life of imperialism will certainly not be long.
    The Chinese and Algerian people have formed a close fighting friendship in the common struggle against imperialism. The Chinese people are pleased to know that the leaders of the Chinese and Algerian governments studied various ways to enhance friendly cooperation between China and Algeria during the talks. We firmly believe that the friendship between the Chinese and Algerian people will be continuously consolidated and developed with time. Let us hold high the banner of anti-imperialism and advance together!

### 高举反对帝国主义的旗帜共同前进

    高举反对帝国主义的旗帜共同前进
    以克里姆·贝勒卡塞姆副总理为首的阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团已经结束了在我国的友好访问。这些天里，克里姆·贝勒卡塞姆副总理和其他阿尔及利亚的贵宾们在我国各地进行了参观访问，和我国人民一道欢度了“五一”国际劳动节，并同我国国家领导人举行了亲切友好的会晤。今天本报发表了中阿两国政府的联合公报，这个公报表明了两国政府对国际形势的一致看法，表明了中国人民和阿尔及利亚人民在反对帝国主义的共同斗争中的相互关怀和支持。我们深信，以克里姆·贝勒卡塞姆副总理为首的阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表团通过这次访问，将把六亿五千万中国人民的兄弟般的友情和深挚的敬意带回给正在为自己祖国独立而战斗的阿尔及利亚的英雄人民。
    联合公报指出，在会谈中，中华人民共和国政府严厉地反对和谴责法帝国主义在美帝国主义支持下向阿尔及利亚人民进行的殖民战争和侵略罪行。谁都知道，阿尔及利亚战争是法国帝国主义发动的肮脏的殖民战争。法国殖民者奴役阿尔及利亚已达一百三十年之久，给阿尔及利亚人民造成了深重的灾难。阿尔及利亚一半以上的可耕地被一小撮殖民者所霸占，阿尔及利亚的资源几乎都操在法国垄断公司的手中。在阿尔及利亚一千万人口中，失业和半失业达到二百万人，数百万人经常陷于饥饿，成百万学龄儿童在街头流浪。阿尔及利亚人民被剥夺了一切政治权利。为了法国垄断资本的利益，从1955年以来的法国历届政府不惜动员这个国家的大部分军事力量，对要求民族独立的阿尔及利亚人民发动了空前野蛮的灭绝人性的殖民战争。几年以来，自命为“文明使者”的法国殖民者在阿尔及利亚屠杀了一百万人，把一百多万人拘于集中营，数十万人投入监狱，并施以种种惨无人道的酷刑；另有数十万人沦落异国，流离失所。法国帝国主义者在阿尔及利亚战争中所犯下的滔天罪行，遭到全世界的强烈谴责和反对。
    阿尔及利亚人民一个多世纪以来，没有停止过争取独立的斗争，先后爆发过武装起义五十次之多。阿尔及利亚的民族解放战争是全世界人民反对帝国主义、保卫世界和平斗争的一个部分。中国人民坚定不移地支持阿尔及利亚人民的斗争，正如中阿两国政府联合公报所庄严宣布的，“中国政府重申其坚决支持阿尔及利亚人民争取民族独立的正义斗争。”
    法国对阿尔及利亚人民进行的殖民战争完全是在美帝国主义的积极支持下进行的。美帝国主义为了掠夺撒哈拉油田和阿尔及利亚丰富资源，为了镇压非洲和阿拉伯各国的民族独立运动，不断以大量美元和武器帮助法国帝国主义者屠杀阿尔及利亚人民，以支撑法国在阿尔及利亚的殖民统治的残局。克里姆·贝勒卡塞姆副总理在我国贺龙副总理的欢迎宴会上正确地指出，“美帝国主义和法国殖民主义者正在互相勾结，要击败阿尔及利亚的革命”。很明显，今天美帝国主义已经成为阿尔及利亚人民的最危险的敌人。
    现在，戴高乐已经赤裸裸地揭下了他的所谓阿尔及利亚人民“自决”的伪装，而叫嚣“通过武力恢复和平”。去年底，前法国武装部队部长居约马在参议院辩论军事预算时宣布，在新的军事预算草案中，“阿尔及利亚的行动仍将有优先权”，并且要进一步“通过外国盟邦来取得”“打击力量”。同时，法国殖民者正在美帝国主义支持下阴谋扩大阿尔及利亚战争，最近法国军队连续侵犯突尼斯边境，法国飞机轰炸了突尼斯和摩洛哥的国土。美、法帝国主义者都在借此恫吓阿尔及利亚人民。但是，五年半的阿尔及利亚战争证明了阿尔及利亚民族解放军日益壮大，而法国殖民军则日益削弱。五年多以来，法国殖民军已被打死打伤达十余万人，今年头四个月阿尔及利亚民族解放军又打死打伤法军近两万人。为正义事业而战的人民必胜，为维护殖民统治而战的帝国主义者必败，这是确定不移的。联合公报表达了中国人民的这种信念：“英勇的阿尔及利亚人民在全世界爱好和平的人民的支持下，坚持斗争，一定能够战胜帝国主义和殖民主义，取得民族解放斗争的最后胜利。”
    联合公报正确地估计了国际形势，特别是亚非地区的形势。双方一致高兴地看到民族解放斗争的风暴正在猛烈地席卷亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的广大地区。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民正在结成广泛的反对帝国主义的统一战线。最近时期，形势越来越有利于各国人民的民族解放斗争。亚洲各国被压迫人民正在兴起反对帝国主义及其走狗的伟大的斗争风暴。日本人民、南朝鲜人民和土耳其人民的斗争以及全世界各国人民反对帝国主义的正义斗争，都是对中国人民和阿尔及利亚人民斗争的极大的鼓舞和支持。而中国人民和阿尔及利亚人民的斗争也是对世界各国人民反对帝国主义斗争的鼓舞和支持。正如中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席所说：“全世界各国人民的正义斗争，都是互相支持的。”中阿两国政府的联合公报表达了两国人民对于正在进行争取和维护民族独立和民主自由的正义斗争的亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民的坚决支持。帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义不仅是中阿两国人民的共同敌人，而且是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和全世界人民的共同敌人。只要全世界各国人民在反对帝国主义斗争的旗帜下团结起来，结成牢不可破的统一战线，正如联合公报所指出的，帝国主义的寿命一定不会很长了。
    中阿两国人民在反对帝国主义的共同斗争中已经结成了亲密的战斗友谊。中国人民高兴地知道，中阿两国政府的领导人在会谈中研究了增进中阿两国友好合作关系的各种途径。我们坚决相信，中阿两国人民的友谊将会随着时间而得到不断地巩固和发展。让我们高举反对帝国主义的旗帜，共同前进吧！
