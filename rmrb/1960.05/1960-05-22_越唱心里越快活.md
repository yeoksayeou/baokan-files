(Liuqin Performance)
[Performed by the Shandong Delegation]

The general line shines brightly on our rivers and mountains,
The cultural revolution is as red as fire,
Old Xue has thrown off his illiteracy hat,
Singing happily a song.
I, Old Xue, am forty-four this year,
And was blind for half my life.
In the old society, I suffered all kinds of hardships,
I couldn't get a chance to go to school and study.
I couldn't recognize even a few big characters,
I didn't know my own name for half my life.
Two years ago, I went to the Yucun Mine,
To attend an evening school.
One day I learned three characters,
But forgot two out of three.
Forget it, forget it,
If I don't study, I'll just work.
One day, the Party Branch Secretary smiled
And came into the kitchen.
He called out to me as soon as he entered, "Old Xue!"
"Why haven't you been to school these past few days?"
"Have you encountered difficulties and want to quit?"
Secretary, ah! My age is advanced, and my brain is slow,
I learn less than I forget.
I think I should just quit,
Being uneducated doesn't stop me from working.
The Secretary said, "Old Xue, ah,
In order to build our country even better,
Everyone must master culture and science.
As long as we have a strong will and determination,
Even the greatest difficulties can be solved.
If you learn one character a day,
You can learn more than three hundred in a year!"
That's right, from now on I'll be determined to learn culture,
If I don't get rid of my illiteracy, I won't be named Xue!
Studying until eleven at night,
Getting up early with the stars still in the sky.
Combining work with literacy,
Whatever I do, I learn.
Cutting cabbage, I learned the character for "knife,"
Stir-frying shredded pork, I learned "spoon" and "pot,"
Rolling noodles, I learned "rolling pin,"
Steaming buns, I learned "hot steamed bun."
Persisting in studying for six months,
I passed all the tests.
I can read books and newspapers,
And understand the major events of the country.
From now on, I can throw off my illiteracy hat,
And I can do more work for the Party.
The Party calls on us to learn culture,
The Party's words are always in my heart.
Who says I'm old and have a bad memory?
I still want to finish middle school and go to college.
Self-composed and self-sung Liuqin piece,
The more I sing, the happier I feel!
