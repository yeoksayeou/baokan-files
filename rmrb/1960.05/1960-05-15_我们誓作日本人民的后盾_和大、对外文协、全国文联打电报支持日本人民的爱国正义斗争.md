Xinhua News Agency, 14th. The China Peace Committee sent a telegram on the 14th to the National Council Against Revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," expressing heartfelt respect to the Japanese people who are resolutely fighting against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.

The telegram stated: "The soaring fighting spirit of the Japanese people has further struck at the criminal conspiracy of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries to plan a new war, and has made a significant contribution to defending peace in Asia and the world. We are also pleased to inform you that the Chinese people, since May 9th, have continuously held large-scale parades, demonstrations, and rallies across the country to firmly oppose the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and fully support the patriotic and just struggle of the Japanese people. The powerful struggle of the Chinese and Japanese people against a common enemy is forcefully striking at the war and aggression forces colluding between U.S. imperialism and the Nobusuke Kishi clique. The Japanese people are increasingly clearly aware that the presence of U.S. imperialism's troops in Japan, including troops with nuclear weapons, not only blatantly infringes upon Japan's independence and sovereignty, but also seriously threatens the safety of the Japanese nation, and at any time there is a danger of turning Japan into a sea of fire for aggressive wars launched by the United States. The recently revealed spy activities and reckless behavior of U.S. aircraft using Japanese bases against China and the Soviet Union have further aroused the anger of the broad masses of the Japanese people. The Chinese people resolutely do not allow the U.S.-Japan reactionaries to act wantonly. The 650 million Chinese people stand completely on the side of the Japanese people. We are willing to join hands closely with the Japanese people, together with the people of Asian and other countries, to fight to the end against our common enemy, U.S. imperialism, and to smash the aggression and war plans of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries."

Xinhua News Agency, 13th. The Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries sent a telegram today to the National Council Against Revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," stating that the Chinese people have always firmly and unswervingly supported the Japanese people's anti-U.S. patriotic and just struggle until the Japanese people achieve complete, final, and thorough victory.

The telegram from the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries stated: "Recently, U.S. imperialism instigated the Nobusuke Kishi clique to openly attempt to use despicable means such as extending the Diet session to realize the conspiracy to approve this aggressive military alliance treaty. Its purpose is to make Japan a U.S. nuclear weapons base in the Far East, establish a U.S., Japan, and West German axis, and become a central link in its military bloc. The Nobusuke Kishi clique, the agent of the interests of the Japanese monopoly capital group, also attempts to take this opportunity to rely on the power of U.S. imperialism to carry out aggression and expansion towards China and Southeast Asia, revive Japanese militarism, and realize its old dream of the 'Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.' It is obvious that the conclusion of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty is aimed at China, the Soviet Union, and Asian countries. At the same time, it is also a serious threat to all peace-loving countries and peoples, and for the Japanese people it is the beginning of a new and great disaster. These crimes of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries are resolutely opposed by the Japanese people, and are also resolutely opposed by the Chinese people and peace-loving people all over the world!

"The Japanese people's anti-U.S. patriotic and just struggle is by no means isolated. The Chinese people have always firmly and unswervingly stood by your side, always regarding your struggle as our own struggle and supporting your struggle as our sacred duty. On May 9th, in our capital—Beijing, more than one million people held a large demonstration to support you. These actions expressed the strong will and determination of the 650 million Chinese people to support the Japanese people's anti-U.S. patriotic struggle. In Cuba, in South Korea, in Turkey, anti-U.S. struggles taking place all over the world are also strongly supporting you. People all over the world support you until your struggle achieves complete, final, and thorough victory.

"Our common enemy, U.S. imperialism, is being constantly exposed and attacked by people all over the world, its wolfish face has been fully revealed, and it is increasingly isolated. The future of the Japanese people's struggle is infinitely bright. Although the Japanese people's future struggle will still be arduous and even long-term, the current international situation is unprecedentedly favorable to the Japanese people's struggle. We firmly believe that the power of the united Japanese people is the irresistible raging fire erupting from Mount Fuji, which will surely burn the U.S. imperialist forces赖 on Japanese soil to a crisp, and Nobusuke Kishi will ultimately not be able to escape the fate of someone like Syngman Rhee. The Chinese and Japanese people unite with the people all over the world to overthrow U.S. imperialism! Final victory will surely belong to the Japanese people! A new Japan that is independent, democratic, peaceful, and neutral will surely appear."

Xinhua News Agency, 13th. The China Federation of Literary and Art Circles sent a telegram today to the National Council Against Revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" to support the 16th National Unified Action of the Japanese people against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.

The telegram from the CFLAC stated: "The Japanese people's 16th National Unified Action against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty strongly reflects the common will of the Japanese people to strive for an independent, democratic, peaceful, and neutral Japan. Regarding this indomitable and persevering heroic struggle of the Japanese people, we, on behalf of all Chinese literary and art workers, express our firm support for you and, through you, express our high respect to the Japanese people and Japanese literary and art workers.

"U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the Chinese and Japanese people, and the Chinese people firmly support the struggle of the Japanese people. We Chinese literary and art workers are pleased to see that Japanese cultural and artistic figures are increasingly widely joining the ranks of the Japanese people's struggle against U.S. imperialism and against the revival of militarism; we are very pleased to see that the Japanese people have continuously achieved great victories in the struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. We firmly believe that the strong and unyielding heroic struggle carried out by the Japanese people with the support of the people all over the world will surely achieve final victory."

    我们誓作日本人民的后盾
    和大、对外文协、全国文联打电报支持日本人民的爱国正义斗争
    新华社14日讯　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会14日打电报给日本阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议，向为反对日美军事同盟条约进行坚决斗争的日本人民，表示衷心的敬意。
    电报说：“日本人民气势昂扬的斗志，进一步打击了美日反动派策划新战争的罪恶阴谋，对保卫亚洲和世界和平作了重大的贡献。我们也很高兴告诉你们，中国人民从5月9日起，几天来在全国各地连续举行规模盛大的游行、示威、集会，坚决反对日美军事同盟条约，全力支援日本人民的爱国正义斗争。中日两国人民为反对共同敌人的强大斗争，正有力地打击着美帝国主义和岸信介集团相勾结的战争和侵略势力。日本人民越来越清楚地认识到，美帝国主义驻扎在日本的包括带有核武装的军队，不但露骨地侵犯日本的独立和主权，并且严重地威胁日本民族的安全，随时都有把日本变成美国发动的侵略战争火海的危险。最近所揭露的美国飞机利用日本基地对中、苏进行间谍活动和玩火行为，更激起了广大日本人民的愤怒。中国人民坚决不允许美日反动派恣意妄为。六亿五千万中国人民完全站在日本人民一边。我们愿与日本人民紧密携起手来，同亚洲和世界各国人民一道，为反对共同的敌人美帝国主义、粉碎美日反动派的侵略和战争计划而斗争到底。”
    新华社13日讯　中国人民对外文化协会今天打电报给日本阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议说，中国人民始终坚定不渝地支持日本人民反美爱国的正义斗争，直到日本人民取得完全的最后的彻底胜利。
    中国人民对外文化协会的电报说：“最近，美帝国主义唆使岸信介集团公然妄图用延长国会会期等卑鄙手段，来实现批准这个侵略性军事同盟条约的阴谋，其目的是使日本成为美国在远东的核武器基地，建立一个美、日、西德轴心，成为它拼凑军事集团的中心环节。日本垄断资本集团利益的代理人岸信介集团也企图趁机倚仗美帝国主义势力，向中国和东南亚进行侵略和扩张，复活日本军国主义，实现其‘大东亚共荣圈’的旧梦。显而易见，日美军事同盟条约的缔结，矛头针对中苏和亚洲国家，同时，对于一切爱好和平的国家和人民也是一个严重的威胁，对于日本人民更是一场新的巨大灾难的开始。日美反动派的这些罪行，是日本人民所坚决反对的，也是中国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民所坚决反对的！
      “日本人民反美爱国的正义斗争绝不是孤立的，中国人民始终坚定不渝地站在你们一边，一向把你们的斗争看作自己的斗争，把支持你们的斗争当作自己的神圣义务。5月9日在我国首都——北京，一百多万人大示威支持你们，这些行动表达了六亿五千万中国人民支持日本人民反美爱国斗争的坚强意志和决心。在古巴，在南朝鲜，在土耳其，在世界各地发生的反美斗争也有力地支持你们，全世界人民都支持你们，直到你们的斗争取得完全的，最后的，彻底的胜利。
    “中日两国人民的共同敌人美帝国主义在全世界人民不断的揭露和打击下，豺狼的面目已暴露无遗，越来越陷于孤立。日本人民的斗争前途是无限光明的，尽管日本人民今后的斗争还是艰苦甚至是长期的，但是，目前国际形势空前有利于日本人民的斗争，我们坚信：团结起来的日本人民的力量，是从富士山喷发出来的无坚不摧的熊熊烈火，它必将把赖在日本国土上的美帝国主义势力烧得一干二净，岸信介最终也必将逃脱不了像李承晚那样的下场。中日两国人民同全世界人民联合起来，打倒美帝国主义！最后胜利必然属于日本人民！独立、民主、和平、中立的新日本一定会出现。”
    新华社13日讯　中国文学艺术界联合会今天打电报给日本阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议，支持日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约第十六次全国统一行动。
    全国文联的电报说：“日本人民反对日美军事同盟条约第十六次全国统一行动，强烈地反映了为争取独立、民主、和平、中立的日本人民的共同意志。对于日本人民这一不屈不挠、再接再厉的英勇的斗争，我们谨代表全中国文学艺术工作者，表示坚决对你们的支持并通过你们向日本人民、日本的文学艺术工作者致以崇高的敬意。
    “美帝国主义者是中日两国人民共同的敌人，中国人民是坚决支持日本人民的斗争的。我们中国文艺工作者高兴地看到日本文化艺术界人士越来越广泛地加入了日本人民的反对美帝国主义和反对军国主义复活的斗争行列；我们很高兴地看到日本人民在反对日美军事同盟条约的斗争中，不断的取得了巨大的胜利。我们坚信，日本人民在全世界人民的支持下所进行的坚强不屈的英雄的斗争，必能取得最后的胜利。”
