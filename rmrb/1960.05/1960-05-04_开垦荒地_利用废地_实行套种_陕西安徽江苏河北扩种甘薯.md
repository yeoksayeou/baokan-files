Expand Sweet Potato Planting by Reclaiming Wasteland, Utilizing Barren Land, and Implementing Intercropping in Shaanxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Hebei

    (Our report) Shaanxi is making every effort to expand the planting of tuber crops. As of April 25, the area sown and planted with tuber crops has reached more than 2.66 million mu, close to the province's total planting area last year.

    Shaanxi Province regards tuber crops as a staple food this year, given their high yield and multiple uses, and considers it a major measure to achieve high-speed development of grain production. Last year, the province's tuber crop planting area accounted for only 3.6% of the grain crop area. This year it is planned to increase to 9%.

    In order to ensure the completion of the tuber crop expansion plan, while the planting area of ​​grain and cotton crops has been expanded compared with last year, people's communes in various places have generally reclaimed wasteland and restored abandoned farmland. They have also widely used scattered open spaces such as beside villages, houses, courtyards, wells, roads, threshing grounds, ponds, canals, rivers, and graves to plant tuber crops. According to statistics, various places have "searched" out more than 2.9 million mu of land through the above methods, solving the problem of insufficient tuber crop planting area.

    While expanding the planting area of ​​tuber crops, various places have also focused on planting quality, striving to achieve one sowing, one full stand of seedlings; plant one seedling and harvest one; plant one mu and harvest one mu. This year's tuber crop planting quality has exceeded any previous year.

    (Our report) Anhui is universally promoting the method of intercropping corn in sweet potato fields during spring planting, striving for high yields and bumper harvests of both sweet potatoes and corn.

    This year, Anhui Province's spring sweet potato planting area has more than doubled compared to last year, of which more than 7.9 million mu will be intercropped with corn; plus the spring corn planted alone, the corn planting area has also more than doubled compared to last year.

    Intercropping corn in sweet potato fields is one of the effective ways to fully utilize the potential of the land and increase grain production. Planting corn in the gaps between the sweet potato ridges does not occupy entire plots of cultivated land. Furthermore, tall and short crops are intercropped together, which does not affect ventilation and light transmission. The work of land preparation, fertilization, and management of corn can be combined with the cultivation of sweet potatoes, saving a lot of labor. Therefore, the masses praised this intercropping method as "labor-saving, guaranteed harvest, and does not occupy land."

    This year is the first time that intercropping corn in sweet potato fields has been universally promoted throughout the province, and party committees at all levels have strengthened their leadership. According to statistics on April 26, 6.4 million mu of spring sweet potato ridges have been prepared throughout the province. In many places, in order to stagger farm work and achieve the goal of timely early sowing and high yield, corn has been sown before the spring sweet potatoes are planted.

    (Our report) In the magnificent spring planting campaign, Jiangsu Province is launching a upsurge of large-scale planting of sweet potatoes as a high-yield crop. This year, the province's planned sweet potato planting area will be greatly expanded compared to last year, of which the spring sweet potato area will be nearly doubled compared to last year.

    On the basis of fully preparing all tasks, all localities have seized the season, raced against time, taken comprehensive action, and the planting time of spring sweet potatoes has generally been advanced by ten to fifteen days compared to last year. As of April 25, the province has planted about 200,000 mu of spring sweet potatoes, an increase of five times compared to the same period last year.

    Jiangsu is comprehensively improving the planting quality of spring sweet potatoes based on the spirit of planting more, planting quickly, and planting well. In Xuzhou and Huaiyin, key sweet potato producing areas, all sweet potato fields have been strip-ridged and deeply plowed. Land preparation and ridging have also been carried out, and sufficient base fertilizer has been applied. The method of high ridge, double row, and close planting has been comprehensively promoted, planting more than 1,000 more plants per mu than last year.

    (Our report) This year, Hebei Province plans to expand the area of ​​five major high-yield crops, including sweet potatoes, corn, rice, millet, and multi-headed sorghum, by nearly 20% compared to last year. As of April 24, the province has sown more than 9 million mu.

    This year, in order to achieve large-scale high yields, various places have regarded expanding the planting area of ​​high-yield crops as an important measure. The planting area of ​​sweet potatoes in the Tianjin area has increased by 80% compared to last year, and the rice planting area has doubled.

    In order to ensure a bumper harvest of high-yield crops, at present, on the basis of implementing the planting plan, all localities are focusing on high standards and high quality of drought resistance and moisture preservation sowing. They are also prominently focusing on the preparation work before transplanting sweet potatoes and rice, so as to achieve strong seedlings, plant one and succeed with one, and ensure a full stand of seedlings in every field.

### 开垦荒地　利用废地　实行套种  陕西安徽江苏河北扩种甘薯

    开垦荒地　利用废地　实行套种
    陕西安徽江苏河北扩种甘薯
    本报讯　陕西各地千方百计扩种薯类作物。截止4月25日统计，各地已经播种和栽秧的薯类作物已达二百六十六万多亩，接近了去年全省的种植面积。
    陕西省根据薯类作物产量高、用处大的特点，今年把薯类提高到主粮的地位，作为实现粮食高速度发展的一项重大措施。去年，全省薯类播种面积仅占粮食作物面积的3.6％，今年计划上升到9％。
    在粮食和棉花等作物的播种面积都比去年扩大的情况下，为了保证完成薯类作物扩种计划，各地人民公社普遍开荒和恢复弃耕地，并且广泛利用村旁、宅旁、院旁、井旁和路边、场边、院内、池边、渠边、河边、坟边等零散空地种植薯类作物。据统计，各地采取上述办法共“搜”出土地二百九十多万亩，解决了薯类播种面积不足的问题。
    各地在扩大薯类播种面积的同时，还大抓播种质量。提出力争做到一次播种，一次全苗；种一窝、收一窝，种一亩、收一亩。今年薯类播种质量超过了以往任何一年。
    本报讯　安徽各地在春播中普遍推行甘薯地里套种玉米的办法，力争甘薯、玉米双高产、双丰收。
    今年安徽省春甘薯的种植面积比去年扩大两倍多，其中有七百九十多万亩要套种玉米；加上单种的春玉米，玉米播种面积也比去年扩大了两倍多。
    甘薯地里套种玉米，是充分发挥土地潜力增加粮食产量的有效办法之一。利用甘薯垅的空隙种玉米，不占用整片的耕地，而且是高矮作物套种在一起，又不影响通风透光。玉米的整地、施肥、管理等工作，都可与培植甘薯结合进行，节省大量劳动力。所以群众称赞这种套种办法是“省力保收不占地”。
    甘薯地里套种玉米，今年是第一次在全省普遍推广，各地党委都加强了领导。到4月26日统计，全省各地已做好春甘薯垅六百四十万亩，很多地方为了错开农活，达到适时早播产量高的目的，在春甘薯没有栽插之前，就已把玉米点种了下去。
    本报讯　江苏省各地在规模壮阔的春播运动中，正在掀起一个大种甘薯高产作物的热潮。今年全省甘薯计划种植面积将比去年扩大很多，其中春甘薯面积比去年扩大近两倍。
    各地在充分做好各项准备工作的基础上，抓季节，抢时间，全面行动，春甘薯的栽插时间普遍比去年提早了十天到十五天，到4月25日止，全省已栽插春甘薯二十万亩左右，比去年同期增加五倍。
    江苏各地本着多种、快种、种好的精神，全面提高春甘薯的栽插质量。甘薯重点产区的徐州、淮阴专区，所有的甘薯地都进行了条垅深翻，还进行了整地扶垅，施足基肥，并全面推广了高垅双行密植，每亩比去年多种一千多棵。
    本报讯　河北省今年计划种植甘薯、玉米、水稻、谷子和多穗高粱等五大高产作物的面积，将比去年扩大近20％。到4月24日，全省已播九百多万亩。
  今年，各地为了实现“千百万”大面积丰产，都把扩大高产作物种植面积作为一项重要措施。天津地区种植甘薯面积比去年增加了80％，水稻种植面积比去年扩大一倍。
    为保证高产作物大丰收，目前各地在种植计划落实的基础上，一方面大抓抗旱抢墒播种的高标准、高质量，一方面突出地抓甘薯、水稻插秧前的准备工作，作到苗肥秧壮，种一棵成一棵，方方块块保全苗。
