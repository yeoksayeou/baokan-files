Xinhua News Agency, May 7th: The members of the Sino-Czech Friendship People's Commune held a grand rally today to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the liberation of Czechoslovakia. Two thousand commune members and Young Pioneers, holding bouquets, beating drums and gongs, and setting off firecrackers, lined the road to welcome Czechoslovak Ambassador to China, Mr. Bušiak, and the Czechoslovak Friendship Delegation led by Mr. Obaufsky, as well as the staff of the Czechoslovak Embassy in China, who came to attend the celebration.

Also attending today's meeting were Cui Yitian, Vice President of the Sino-Czech Friendship Association, Feng Jiping, Deputy Mayor of Beijing, and relevant responsible persons from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and other units.

Today, colorful flags fluttered in the wind at the Sino-Czech Friendship People's Commune. On the road leading to the commune, new pine and cypress arches were erected, with inscriptions reading: "Long Live the Unbreakable Friendship Between the Chinese and Czechoslovak Peoples!" " Long Live the Great Unity Of The Socialist Camp Headed By The Soviet Union! "

Zhang Tingliang, Secretary of the Party Committee of the Sino-Czech Friendship People's Commune, spoke at the meeting. On behalf of all the commune members, he extended festive greetings to the distinguished guests and, through them, to the people of Czechoslovakia. He said: "Over the past few years, we have continuously received fraternal care from the people of Czechoslovakia. Party and state leaders of Czechoslovakia, such as Novotný, Široký, Köpecki, Jankovcová, Firinger, and delegations visiting China have all visited here. In the upsurge of our great leap forward in agricultural production, all the comrades of the Czechoslovak Embassy in China have often come to our commune to carry out field labor, which has greatly encouraged all our commune members. Recently, Chairman Firinger also sent us 1,400 saplings of excellent grape varieties, and we have established the Sino-Czech Friendship Orchard in our commune." He expressed his gratitude on behalf of all commune members.

Czechoslovak Ambassador to China, Mr. Bušiak, introduced the achievements made in all aspects of socialist construction in Czechoslovakia over the past fifteen years since its liberation.

Hermann, a member of the Czechoslovak Friendship Delegation and Chairman of the "Czech-Chinese Friendship" Unified Agricultural Cooperative, also spoke at the meeting and presented exquisite porcelain and other gifts to the commune.

Fu Yongli, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee of the commune, read out a congratulatory telegram to the farmer brothers of Czechoslovakia and all the members of the "Czech-Chinese Friendship" Unified Agricultural Cooperative in the village of Vinařice on behalf of all the commune members.
