    Earnestly Summarize the Experience of Using Rice Transplanters to Plant Early Rice
    Ganxian County Will Use Rice Transplanters for All Late Rice Planting
    Hainan Island Vigorously Manufactures and Promotes Advanced Tools to Accelerate Summer Harvesting Progress
    (Reported by this newspaper) Ganxian County, Jiangxi Province, is earnestly summarizing the experience of using rice transplanters to plant early rice, to improve the level of manufacturing and using rice transplanters and strive to realize the complete mechanization of late rice planting by using rice transplanters.
    This year, Ganxian County manufactured more than 1,700 "Jiangxi 59 Type" rice transplanters, planting 101,000 mu of early rice, accounting for 30% of the county's early rice area. Rice transplanters have played a huge role in planting early rice. First, they improved labor efficiency by seven to eleven times compared to manual transplanting, saving the county more than 53,000 workdays. At the same time, they greatly accelerated the planting progress, completing planting half a season earlier than in previous years. Second, the spacing and depth of the planted rice hills were uniform. However, among the more than 1,700 rice transplanters, more than 300 were not used in the fields, because these rice transplanters were of poor manufacturing quality, or there was not enough time to train the rice transplanter operators.
    How can the role of rice transplanters be fully utilized in planting late rice? The Ganxian County Party Committee has put forward a manufacturing and usage plan. The county plans to manufacture 3,300 rice transplanters before planting late rice (bringing the total to 5,000), and at the same time, adopt many specific measures in manufacturing and usage. For example, organize various manufacturing plants to disseminate and promote advanced experience to each other, and select a group of experienced workers and technicians to visit brother counties to learn manufacturing technology. To ensure quality, a method of fixed specialization and division of labor is adopted, and strict inspection and on-site appraisal must be carried out after manufacturing.
    To improve the level of using rice transplanters, in addition to organizing and improving the existing 3,500 rice transplanter operators, 6,000 to 7,000 young men and women will be selected from the commune members for training, so that the county will have 10,000 rice transplanter operators, an average of two rice transplanter operators per machine. The county has also established a group of rice transplanter operator models, and the communes have also held night schools to train rice transplanter operators on the technology of operating rice transplanters.
    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 27th. Hainan Island is vigorously reforming summer harvesting tools. According to incomplete statistics, a large number of ox carts, handcarts, threshers, harvesters, etc., have been manufactured and promoted in the region, and more than 10,000 drying grounds have been built.
    This year, Hainan Island's tool reform has made new progress. The First Secretaries of the Party Committees of each commune, as well as the industrial and agricultural secretaries, all focused on one brigade, adopting the method of living in the team, eating in the team, and working in the team, to strengthen the leadership of the summer harvesting tool reform. The labor force invested in tool reform in various counties has mostly increased several times compared to the past, and the quality of tool reform has also been greatly improved compared to the past.
    To enable innovative tools to play a role in summer harvesting, all localities have paid special attention to grasping the work of promotion, use, and storage and maintenance, to ensure the wide use of new tools.

    认真总结使用插秧机栽早稻的经验
    赣县栽晚稻将全部使用插秧机
    海南岛大力制造推广先进工具加快夏收进度
    本报讯　江西赣县认真总结使用插秧机栽插早稻的经验，以便提高制造与使用插秧机水平，争取实现栽插晚稻全部使用插秧机化。
    今年赣县制造了一千七百多部“江西59型”插秧机，栽插早稻十万一千亩，占全县早稻面积30％。插秧机在栽插早稻中发挥了巨大作用，首先它比人工手插秧提高工效七倍至十一倍，全县因此节省了五万三千多个劳动日，同时大大加快了插秧进度，比往年提早了半个节令插完秧；其次，插的秧穴距、深浅均匀。但是在一千七百多部插秧机中，还有三百多部没有下田使用，原因是这些插秧机制造质量较差，或是没有来得及训练好插秧机手。
    如何在栽插晚稻中，充分发挥插秧机的作用？赣县县委已经提出了制造与使用的计划。全县计划在栽插晚稻前制造三千三百部插秧机
  （加上原来的共有五千部），同时在制造、使用方面采取了许多具体措施。如组织各制造厂互相传布与推广先进经验，并选拔一批有经验的工人和技术人员到兄弟县参观学习制造技术。为了保证质量，还采取固定专业、分工制造的办法，制成后一定要严格检查、实地鉴定。
    在提高使用插秧机的水平上，除对原有的三千五百名插秧机手进行组织、提高外，还要从社员中选出六千至七千名男女青年进行训练，这样全县就有一万名插秧机手，平均每部插秧机有两名插秧机手。全县还树立了一批插秧机手标兵，各公社还举办了操作插秧机技术夜校训练插秧机手。
    新华社广州27日电　海南岛大力改革夏收工具。据不完全统计，目前全区已经制造推广了大批牛车、手推车、打谷机、收割器等，并修建了晒谷场一万多处。
    今年海南岛的工具改革有了新的发展。各公社党委第一书记及工、农业书记，都以一个大队为重点，采取住在队里、吃在队里、工作在队里的方法，加强夏收工具改革的领导。各县投入工具改革的劳动力大都比过去成倍增加，工具改革质量，也比过去大大提高。
    为了使革新工具在夏收中发挥作用，各地特别注意抓紧推广、使用和保管、维修的工作。保证新工具广泛使用。
