    The American Warmongers Must Be Thoroughly Exposed
    Song Qingling
    The people of all countries have once again seen the true face of American imperialism. The state machinery of the United States is controlled by its most疯狂的唯利是图 [fanatical and profit-seeking] warmongers, and the US government deliberately undermined the four-power summit, thus aggravating international tensions. This is the only conclusion that can be drawn from the events since the American U-2 plane intruded into Soviet airspace for espionage activities prior to the Paris Conference. The U.S. government and its spokesmen handled this incident in a very shameful manner, openly lying to the people of all countries, and after these lies were exposed again, they tried to brazenly deal with their desperate situation, telling the truth that these provocative actions were an immutable part of their policy towards the Soviet Union and other socialist countries.
    This is a lesson that the people of all countries must fully understand. The US imperialists have undoubtedly shown that it is they who are threatening world peace, and in the most irresponsible manner, putting the danger of a third world war on the heads of the people of all countries, and this world war will certainly be an atomic war. This despicable situation must be exposed so that peace-loving people everywhere, including the people of the United States itself, will know the true state of the world. The courage and straightforward action taken by the Soviet government and Khrushchev in presenting the facts to international public opinion and the heads of the four powers is the only correct approach to take. The Chinese people wholeheartedly support this action and call on the people of all countries to unite to bring the American warmongers to justice.
    The Chinese people, along with all honest men and women around the world, demand peace. We most strongly condemn the destructive methods of the US imperialists, who, through this spy plane incident, their dishonest and shameful explanations, and their stubborn defense of such criminal activities, have intensified the world's "cold war." But they must know that while we abhor what they have done, and while we demand peace and friendly relations between nations, we will never fail to respond to such provocations, but will give a due response and tell the truth to the people. We say we want peace, but if the US imperialists want war, they will encounter the full force of a united people, and that force is invincible.
    The disruption of the four-power summit is another sign of the disintegration of the entire imperialist system. It is a sign of a death throe. As Chairman Mao Zedong has repeatedly said, the life of imperialism will not be long. The Chinese people are united and firmly opposed to this scourge of mankind. The strength of our 650 million people is part of the great and invincible strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. This force, coupled with the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America who oppose imperialism and strive for national independence and economic freedom, plus all the people of the world who demand peace and justice, constitutes the majority of mankind. The imperialists have long done bad things and卑鄙肮脏 [despicable and dirty] things to the people of the world. We cannot and should not expect them to change their nature. Peace, democracy, and the elimination of all oppression and exploitation is a beautiful, upright, and just cause. It is this cause that the people support, and it will certainly and completely defeat imperialism in the end.
    All people unite, defend their national integrity, overthrow imperialism, and defend world peace! (Xinhua News Agency)

    必须彻底揭露美国战争贩子
    宋庆龄
    世界各国人民再一次看清了美帝国主义的真面目。美国的国家机器掌握在它的最疯狂的唯利是图的战争贩子的手中，美国政府故意来破坏四国政府首脑会议，因而加剧了国际紧张局势。这就是在巴黎会议以前美国U—2型飞机侵入苏联领空进行间谍活动以来的一些事件中，所可以得出的唯一结论。美国政府和它的发言人对这个事件作了非常可耻的处理，公开向世界各国人民说谎，在这种谎言再次被揭穿以后，便设法厚着脸皮来应付他们的绝望处境，说出了真话，即这种挑衅行动是他们对苏联和其它社会主义国家的政策的不变的部分。
    这是世界各国人民必须充分了解的教训。美帝国主义者毫无疑问地表明，正是他们威胁世界和平，并且以最不负责的方式把第三次世界大战的危险置于世界各国人民的头上，而这个世界大战肯定会是一次原子战。必须揭露这个可鄙的情况，以便各地的爱好和平的人民，包括美国本国的人民在内，会知道世界的真实状况。苏联政府和赫鲁晓夫在向国际舆论和四国会议的首脑摆出事实时的勇气和采取的率直行动是应当采取的唯一的正确方针。中国人民全心全意地支持这个行动，并且号召世界各国人民团结一致使美国战争贩子就范。
    中国人民和全世界一切正直的男女一道要求实现和平。我们最强烈地谴责美帝国主义者的破坏手法，他们通过这次间谍飞机事件，他们的不老实的和可耻的解释以及对这种罪恶活动的顽固辩解，已经加剧了世界的“冷战”。但是，他们必须知道，虽然我们憎恶他们所做的这件事情，虽然我们要求和平和各国间保持友好关系，但是我们绝不会对这种挑衅行为不做出回答，而是将给予应有的答复并且把真相告诉给人民。我们说我们要和平，但是如果美帝国主义者要战争的话，他们将碰到团结起来的人民的全部力量，而这种力量是无敌的。
    四国政府首脑会议的遭到破坏是整个帝国主义制度分崩离析的又一个标志。它是一种垂死挣扎的标志。正如毛泽东主席所一再说的，帝国主义的寿命不会很长了。中国人民团结一致，坚决反对人类的这种灾害。我国六亿五千万人民的力量是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大的不可战胜的力量的一部分。这一力量加上亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲反对帝国主义、争取民族独立和经济自由的各国人民，加上世界上要求和平和正义的一切人们，构成人类的大多数。帝国主义者长期以来一直对世界各国人民做坏事，作卑鄙肮脏的事。我们不可能也不应该期望他们改变他们的本性。和平、民主和消除一切压迫和剥削是一件美好的、正大光明的和正义的事业。人民拥护的正是这一事业，它到头来会肯定地、完全地击败帝国主义。
    一切人民团结起来，保卫他们的国家完整，打倒帝国主义，保卫世界和平！　（新华社）
