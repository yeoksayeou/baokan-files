    The Rebirth of Shandong Fei Peaches
    By Our Correspondents Hu Lei and Zhu Yuemei
    People only know that the famous Shandong Fei peaches are juicy, delicious, and sweeter than honey, but they don't know that this area has historically been dry and water-scarce. Now, the members of the Taoyuan Commune in Feicheng County, the origin of Fei peaches, are fully utilizing the superiority of the People's Commune. In just half a year, they have fundamentally changed the old appearance of the mountainous area, ending the history of "peach orchard hometown, historically lacking water."
    Taoyuan Commune is located northwest of Mount Tai, with barren hills and ridges accounting for more than 70% of the entire commune's area. The people living here have historically suffered from water scarcity. At the head of Shangli Village, there still stands a stone tablet of unverifiable age that reads "Shangli has historically lacked water." Because of the lack of water, the famous Fei peaches have been slow to develop. In the early days of liberation in 1949, there were only 1,600 peach trees.
    After the establishment of the Taoyuan People's Commune, the commune members brought into play the strength of the collective, and in accordance with the principle of overall planning and comprehensive management, adopted a combination of mountains, water, forests, fields, roads, and livestock to make specific plans for all 96 mountains in the commune. Under the unified leadership of the commune, a comprehensive and thorough mountain and water management movement was launched, overcoming the past situation where "you manage but he doesn't move," "manage the mountains but don't plant trees," and "level the land but don't manage the mountains." A new situation has emerged in which mountains, water, forests, fields, roads, and livestock are comprehensively managed and improved all at once.
    The mountain and water management army dug more than 3.75 million fish-scale pits and 6,500 gully control lines on 96 mountains, and planted more than 4 million timber trees such as pine, cypress, and willow in the fish-scale pits and gully control lines. This transformed the bare mountains into green mountains with grass and trees.
    Based on the principle of simultaneous management from top to bottom and complete improvement in one go, they leveled terraced fields, built peach orchards, and constructed pig farms in the fields. The commune newly built 50,000 mu of terraced fields. With Baiyun Mountain as the center, 30,000 mu of new peach orchards were built below the mountainside, cultivating 990,000 Fei peach trees. In order to facilitate the use of fertilizer for crops and peach trees, 120 pig farms were also established on the mountains.
    According to the needs of many mountains, uneven roads, and the great development of peach tree production, the Taoyuan Commune newly built 29 roads with a total length of 110,000 meters; these roads connect mountains, fields, villages, and pig farms, and the ring roads around the mountains are well-connected in all directions. On Baiyun Mountain, the "slippery pass" that was difficult to walk across by hand in the past is now accessible to rubber-wheeled carts.
    The Taoyuan Commune has also completed a massive mountain-drilling and water-diversion project. On the Kangwang River, four li away behind Baiyun Mountain, they built a 750-meter-long, 6-meter-wide, and 9-meter-high dam to block the underflow of the Kangwang River. They used a five-stage pumping station with a lift of nearly 60 meters to make the river water climb up the waist of Baiyun Mountain. After passing through the 310-meter-long Baiyun Mountain Tunnel, this project was successfully completed on April 25 and started releasing water on May 4. It will irrigate more than 30,000 mu of farmland and the entire peach orchard, and can supply all the water for eleven water-scarce mountain villages. The development of Shandong Fei peaches and the lives of the people of Taoyuan Commune will begin to enter a new stage. (Attached picture)

    山东肥桃的新生
    本报记者　胡雷　朱曰梅
    人们只知道：著名的山东肥桃汁多味美，赛过蜜糖，但却不知这里历来干旱缺水。现在，肥桃产地肥城县桃园公社的社员们，充分发挥人民公社的优越性，在半年的时间内，根本改变了山区的旧貌，结束了“桃园之乡，自古缺水”的历史。
    桃园公社位于泰山西北，荒山秃岭占了整个公社面积的百分之七十以上。生活在这地方的人，历来受尽缺水之苦，尚里村头至今还竖立着一块年岁无从考查的“尚里自古缺水”的石碑。因为缺水，名贵的肥桃，也迟迟不能发展。在一九四九年初解放时，只有桃树一千六百株。
    桃园人民公社建立后，社员们发挥集体力量，根据全面规划、综合治理的方针，采取了山、水、林、田、路、牧六结合的办法，对全社的九十六个山头，都作了具体的规划。在公社的统一领导下，掀起了全面彻底的治山治水运动，克服了过去那种你治他不动，治山不植树，整地不治山的情况，出现了一个山、水、林、田、路、牧综合治理，一次治好的新局面。
    治山治水大军在九十六座山上挖了三百七十五万多个鱼鳞坑，六千五百处谷坊线，并在鱼鳞坑内和谷坊线上植上了四百多万株松柏、杨柳等用材林。使光秃的山头变成了有草有树的绿山。
    他们根据上下兼治、一次治好的原则，整梯田、建桃园、修田间猪场。全社新修梯田五万亩。以白云山为中心，在山腰以下，新建桃园三万亩，栽培肥桃九十九万株。为了农作物和桃树用肥方便，还在山上建立了一百二十处养猪场。
    桃园公社根据山多路不平和桃树生产大发展的需要，新修了二十九条总长达十一万米的公路；这些公路，通山、通田、通庄、通猪场，环山公路四通八达。白云山上，过去徒手难行的“滑路口”，现在胶轮大车通行无阻。
    桃园公社还建成了一项浩大的凿山引水工程。他们在白云山后四里外的康王河上，筑起了一道七百五十米长、六米宽、九米高的拦河大坝，将康王河潜流拦住，用扬程近六十米高的五级扬水站，使河水爬上白云山腰。穿过三百一十米长的白云山洞隧道，这一工程已于四月二十五日胜利竣工，五月四日开始放水。它将灌溉着三万多亩农田和整个桃园，并可供应十一个缺水山村的全部用水。山东肥桃的发展和桃园公社人民的生活将开始走上一个新的阶段。（附图片）
