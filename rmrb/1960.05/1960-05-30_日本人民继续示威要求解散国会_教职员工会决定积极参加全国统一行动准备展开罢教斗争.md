Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 29th: Japanese people from all walks of life continue to hold rallies, demonstrations, and petitions, demanding the dissolution of the Diet, demanding Nobusuke Kishi's resignation, and refusing to recognize the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" forcibly "passed" by the Kishi Nobusuke group.

More than 2,000 youth workers from the Miike Coal Mine, who have been on strike for a long time, and representatives of trade unions from all over Japan, held a rally in Omuta City today to oppose the ratification of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," demand the dissolution of the Diet, and support the heroic struggle of the Miike Coal Mine workers.

The conference was convened by the Youth Department of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan.

Nakatani, the leader of the youth workers' action team of the Miike Coal Mine Workers' Union, Miyamura branch, said at the meeting that in order to prevent the U.S.-Japan military alliance and force Nobusuke Kishi to dissolve the Diet, young workers must stand at the forefront of the struggle.

Yesterday, ninety professors and staff members (including one American and one Briton) of the International Christian University in Tokyo jointly issued a statement refusing to recognize the new "Security Treaty" that Nobusuke Kishi forced the House of Representatives to "pass." The statement pointed out that the new "Security Treaty" is a U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty. The new "Security Treaty" that Nobusuke Kishi used the police to force the House of Representatives to "pass" should not be recognized. The statement was submitted to Nobusuke Kishi on the 28th.

Two hundred and forty-six professors and staff members of Saitama University issued a statement today demanding the immediate dissolution of the House of Representatives, and mailed a statement signed by all personnel to Nobusuke Kishi.

Representatives of the faculty and staff of the College of Liberal Arts of Tokyo University also petitioned the Diet on the 28th, protesting the Kishi Nobusuke government's violent act of forcibly "passing" the new "Security Treaty" in the House of Representatives, and demanding the dissolution of the Diet.

The Japan Women's Alliance issued a statement on the 27th, declaring the Diet's vote on the new "Security Treaty" invalid and demanding Nobusuke Kishi's resignation.

Thirty people, including Yoichi Wada, a professor at Doshisha University who participated in the Japan Society for Journalism Studies, issued a statement on the 28th, strongly condemning Nobusuke Kishi's slanderous remarks and actions against the Japanese press.

After the rally, 500 Christians conducted a petition demonstration march to the Diet, and at the same time sent representatives to Nobusuke Kishi's official residence to submit a letter of protest.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 29th: The Japan Teachers' Union began its four-day 22nd regular conference in Morioka City, Iwate Prefecture today. The conference will discuss strengthening the struggle in the 17th National Unified Action starting on May 31 and demanding the resignation of Nobusuke Kishi and the dissolution of the Diet.

Today's meeting decided to submit a letter of protest to the U.S. government in the name of the conference, opposing Eisenhower's visit to Japan.

Four hundred and eighty representatives attended the meeting. Kaoru Ota, Chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, Kanju Kato, representative of the Socialist Party, Masao Iwama, representative of the Communist Party, and Masaru Sone, representative of the Democratic Socialist Party, all delivered speeches at the meeting supporting the convening of the conference.

Takeshi Kobayashi, Chairman of the Teachers' Union, emphasized in his speech the importance of overthrowing the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet and dissolving the Diet in order to prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty."

Kaoru Ota said: In the struggle to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet and prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty," organized trade unions must stand at the forefront of the struggle and maintain close contact with the masses.

Before the opening of the conference, the Japan Teachers' Union convened an emergency meeting of the Central Executive Committee this morning to study the issue of preventing the ratification of the "Security Treaty," and decided to submit an emergency proposal to the conference. The proposal stipulates that on June 4, an unprecedented powerful struggle, including a strike, will be launched with the aim of prompting Nobusuke Kishi's resignation and dissolving the Diet.
