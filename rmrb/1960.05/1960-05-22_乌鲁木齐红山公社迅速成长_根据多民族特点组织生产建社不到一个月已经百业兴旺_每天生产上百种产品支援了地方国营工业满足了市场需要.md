    Urumqi Hongshan Commune Grows Rapidly
    Production Organized According to the Characteristics of Multiple Ethnic Groups; Prospering in All Undertakings Less Than One Month After Establishment
    Producing Hundreds of Products Daily to Support Local State-Owned Industry and Meet Market Needs
    (Our Dispatch) Since its establishment less than a month ago, the Hongshan People's Commune in the Tianshan District of Urumqi, the capital of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, has been vigorously developing industry and collective welfare undertakings, bringing about a flourishing situation in this previously relatively poor residential area.
    The Hongshan People's Commune is a multi-ethnic commune mainly composed of street residents and employees' families. In less than a month since its establishment, the commune has established 57 factories and production groups on the basis of vigorously developing street industry in the past, and has set up 46 service stations and collective welfare organizations such as canteens and nurseries. More than 1,300 women from Han, Uygur, Hui, Uzbek and other ethnic groups have been freed from household chores and have participated in various production and work activities.
    The Hongshan People's Commune is located close to the east bank of the Urumqi River, with more than 6,000 households and more than 30,000 people, two-thirds of whom are street residents and employees' families, including twelve ethnic groups such as Han, Uygur, Kazakh, and Uzbek. This area was originally a purely consumer-oriented and relatively poor residential area. In 1957, there was not a single factory in the entire area. In 1958, under the leadership of the local Party organization and inspired by the Great Leap Forward, street residents established ten small factories such as model manufacturing, printing, paint, and wood products, as well as some service organizations, with more than 300 residents participating in production. By the end of last year, the total industrial output value of these street factories reached more than 70,000 yuan, and the accumulated funds reached more than 13,000 yuan. With the expansion of the scale of street industrial production, especially after the construction of some state-owned factories nearby, more and more housewives have taken up production posts. After participating in production, they urgently demanded the establishment of collective welfare undertakings to free themselves from household chores. Under this situation, the street Party organization led the masses through full deliberation and preparation, and officially established the first urban people's commune in Urumqi City—the Hongshan People's Commune—on April 27 this year.
    After the establishment of the Hongshan People's Commune, adhering to the principle of focusing on developing production and comprehensively organizing people's economic life, and according to the local characteristics of having very little industry in the past, a large number of poor residents, and a mix of multiple ethnic groups, it vigorously developed a variety of small factories and service industries by making use of whatever conditions were available. Most of the commune-run industries used waste materials and scraps from large factories for production, and regarded supporting the production of large factories as their important task. In addition to organizing labor to directly participate in production in large factories, the commune also established cooperative relationships with large factories to manufacture parts or process semi-finished products for large factories. The commune's dozens of small factories produce hundreds of products every day, including iron and wood tools urgently needed by nearby large factories, machine models, sandpaper, and best-selling floral hats and children's shoes on the market. Because of insufficient equipment and manpower, the local state-owned Dongfeng Shoe Factory could not produce children's shoes in large quantities, so the commune allocated 50 laborers and set up two children's shoe processing factories specifically to serve the Dongfeng Shoe Factory. The commune-run screw processing factory contracted all the screw processing tasks of the local state-owned machinery factory. In the twenty days since its establishment, it has supplied more than 30,000 sets of screws to the machinery factory, enabling the machinery factory to free up technical forces to strengthen key processes and weak links. The commune-run iron factory, which has been established for less than a month, has already supplied about 500 pieces of equipment and semi-finished products to large factories.
    Because of the large number of production projects in the commune-run industry, residents can give full play to their specialties, which greatly facilitates the participation of housewives in production. Now, more than 1,300 housewives in the entire commune have participated in various production or work activities. Housewives with tailoring skills are assigned to sewing factories, and the elderly and frail participate in light labor such as pasting matchboxes, purchasing, and cleaning streets. When organizing production, the commune also appropriately takes care of the specialties of various ethnic groups. For example, many Uygur residents are blacksmiths, so the commune arranges them in iron factories, and women of Uygur, Uzbek and other ethnic groups who are good at embroidering floral hats (a type of cap worn by the Uygur, Kazakh, and other ethnic groups) mostly participate in the work of the hat factory. Other production items such as weaving pockets and knitting wool are also assigned to ethnic groups with traditional production habits. In this way, it not only meets the needs of various ethnic groups in the market, but also gives full play to the different specialties of commune members of various ethnic groups.
    While fully developing production, commune members of all ethnic groups also started from scratch to develop collective welfare undertakings. The commune has newly established four canteens, all of which were built by the masses themselves in one or two days. The establishment of various collective welfare undertakings has freed 85% of the housewives in the entire commune from household chores and has taken up production posts. The 213 Uygur women who used to stay at home are now active participants in various production activities. The various service stations run by the commune offer more than 20 service items, which greatly facilitates the production, work, and study of employees and residents.
    The relationship between commune members of all ethnic groups has become increasingly close in collective production and life, and many new atmospheres of unity, mutual assistance, and mutual learning have emerged. The 16 Uygur women working in the screw factory rarely interacted with Han women before the establishment of the commune; after participating in screw factory production, they took the initiative to ask to work in the same shift as Han women, learning languages from each other on the one hand and learning technology from Han women on the other. In their work, they help each other and go home together after get off work, forming close friends. In the commune's various factories and service groups, people can see commune members of all ethnic groups working happily together every day, discussing production and work with each other, truly forming a harmonious multi-ethnic family.

    乌鲁木齐红山公社迅速成长
    根据多民族特点组织生产建社不到一个月已经百业兴旺
    每天生产上百种产品支援了地方国营工业满足了市场需要
    本报讯　新疆维吾尔自治区首府乌鲁木齐市天山区的红山人民公社，成立以来不到一个月，大办工业和集体福利事业，使这个过去比较贫困的居民区里出现了百业兴旺的局面。
    红山人民公社是一个多民族的，以街道居民和职工家属为主的人民公社。这个公社在建社不到一个月的时间中，在过去大办街道工业的基础上，建立了五十七个工厂和生产组，并办起四十六个服务站和食堂、托儿所等集体福利组织，有一千三百多名汉、维吾尔、回、乌孜别克等民族的妇女摆脱家务牵累，参加了各项生产和工作。
    红山人民公社紧靠乌鲁木齐河东岸，有六千多户，三万多人，其中三分之二是街道居民和职工家属，包括汉、维吾尔、哈萨克、乌孜别克等十二个民族。这里原来是一个纯消费的、比较贫苦的居民区，1957年全区没有一个工厂。1958年，在当地党组织的领导和大跃进形势的鼓舞下，街道居民办起了模型制造、印刷、油漆、木器等十个小型工厂和一些服务组织，有三百多居民参加了生产。到去年年底这些街道工厂的工业总产值达到七万多元，积累资金达一万三千多元。随着街道工业生产规模的扩大，特别是一些国营工厂在附近兴建起来以后，越来越多的家庭妇女走上了生产的岗位。她们参加生产之后，迫切要求举办集体福利事业，摆脱家务牵累。在这种形势下，街道党组织领导群众经过充分酝酿和准备，在今年4月27日正式成立了乌鲁木齐市第一个城市人民公社——红山人民公社。
    红山人民公社成立以后，本着以发展生产为中心，全面组织人民经济生活的方针，并根据当地在过去工业很少、贫苦居民较多和多民族杂居的特点，因陋就简大办多种多样的小型工厂和服务性行业。社办工业大部利用大工厂的废料、边料进行生产，并且把支援大工厂生产，作为自己的重要任务。公社除了组织劳动力直接到大工厂参加生产外，还和大工厂建立协作关系，为大工厂制造零件或加工半成品，公社的几十个小工厂每天生产出上百种产品，包括附近大工厂急需的铁、木工具，机具模型以及砂纸和市场上畅销的花帽、童鞋等。地方国营东风制鞋厂由于设备和人力不足，不能大量生产童鞋，公社就抽出五十名劳力，专门成立了两个为东风制鞋厂服务的童鞋加工厂。公社办的螺丝加工厂，承包了地方国营机械厂的全部螺丝加工任务。在建厂二十天中，就向机械厂供应了三万多套螺丝，使机械厂能够抽出技术力量去加强主要工序和薄弱环节。成立不到一个月的社办铁工厂，已经为大工厂供应了约五百件器具和半成品。
    社办工业由于生产项目多，使居民都能发挥自己特长，大大便利了家庭妇女参加生产。现在，全社一千三百多名家庭妇女，都参加了各种生产或工作。有裁剪技术的家庭妇女被分配在缝纫厂，年老体弱的参加了糊火柴盒、收购和清扫街道等轻微劳动。在组织生产时，公社还适当地照顾了各民族的特长。例如维吾尔族居民打铁的多，公社就把他们安排到铁工厂，擅长绣制花帽（维、哈等族人戴的一种便帽）的维吾尔、乌孜别克等族妇女，大都参加了制帽厂的工作。其他像织口袋、打毛线等项生产，也分配给有传统生产习惯的民族。这样，既满足了各民族对市场的需要，也充分发挥了各民族社员的不同特长。
    各族社员在全力发展生产的同时，还白手起家兴办集体福利事业。公社新办起四个食堂，都是群众自己动手在一两天内建立起来的。各项集体福利事业的兴办，使全社85％的家庭妇女摆脱家务牵累，走上了生产岗位。过去不出户门的二百一十三名维吾尔族妇女，现在也成了各项生产中的积极分子。公社办的各个服务站，服务项目达二十多种，大大便利了职工和居民的生产、工作和学习。
    各民族社员在集体生产和生活中关系越来越密切，出现了许多团结、互助、互相学习的新气象。在螺丝厂工作的十六名维吾尔族妇女，公社成立前很少和汉族妇女来往；参加螺丝厂生产后，她们主动要求同汉族妇女分在一班工作，一方面互相学习语言，一方面向汉族妇女学技术。在工作中，她们互相帮助，下班一起回家，结成了亲密的朋友。人们在公社的各个工厂和服务组里，每天都会看到各族社员在一起愉快地劳动，互相讨论着生产和工作，真正结成了一个和睦的民族大家庭。
